1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:13,820
Hey, pay no attention to all the drop frames right now. Don't worry about that. It's because

2
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:21,960
I had to re-download all of the DLC again. Remember I came in here and I was like,

3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,839
hey no, it looks like that wasn't the problem. I was too embarrassed to come back and tell you

4
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:32,950
that that's what was happening. So I had to re-download the DLC. And I was like,

5
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:40,200
no, it's all good. I didn't have to do that. I restarted Steam and the download started again.

6
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,179
So we have about two minutes before I can open Hitman 2. I was like, should I come in there?

7
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:52,070
Are people going to laugh at me when I tell them this? Probably. Why am I using so much CPU right

8
00:00:52,070 --> 00:01:05,689
now? Hitman's not even open. Why am I dropping so many? What? Hold on. What's going on with my

9
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:22,859
computer? I'm at 50% CPU. I'm not doing anything. Hold on a second. Oh, this is not... Watch me

10
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:29,140
burn out my CPU. No, and now I'm going to have Hitman open when I'm already at 50%.

11
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,909
Is it... Am I installing a Windows update? Oh, it's because it's installing Hitman. That takes CPU?

12
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:45,379
No, it doesn't. That uses HDD. That uses hard disk drive. That doesn't use that much CPU, does it?

13
00:01:51,689 --> 00:02:01,189
HDD in 2019. You think I got any moving parts in this thing? I got all SD. That's how you know

14
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:10,550
that was a funny lie. HDD. But I'll give you... I'm going to refill this. I'm going to get some

15
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:16,460
good stalling content here. You know, I got to refill this water. So, you know, let me just stall

16
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:21,020
for like another 45 seconds. All right. I've got to tweet it too. Didn't tweet. We're going to do

17
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:25,939
the Hitman 2 DLC. No, no. Wait, wait, wait. Let's talk for a minute before I go do that.

18
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:33,159
So today is the day before TwitchCon. And some might say that TwitchCon actually starts today.

19
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:41,000
So this is the last stream you're going to see from me until I am back from TwitchCon. A lot

20
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,199
of moving around here the last week, the last two weeks of September. So this stream is only going

21
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:53,000
to be a few hours long. We're going to do the Hitman 2 DLC campaigns. I have not done the last

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,639
one. So we'll see how long that takes. After that, I got to go. There's still a few things

23
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:06,620
that I have to take care of before getting on another plane and leaving for four days.

24
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:12,780
Technically three, right? Whatever it is. But give me one second. I'm going to fill this drink up

25
00:03:13,419 --> 00:04:29,319
and then we'll play Hitman 2. Be right back. And I'm going to tweet that. See you in a minute.

26
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:36,889
Yeah, yes, I've seen the new Twitch. I made this reference earlier, but I'm going to make it again.

27
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:49,579
It is the World of Warcraft chat. Especially when you go into all caps. I don't know what

28
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:57,670
the wow chat is. Whatever. I'm of the opinion. Why on earth would you ever under any circumstance?

29
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,110
And I'm not talking about Twitch. I'm just saying ever in general. Why are there so many fonts?

30
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:11,430
12 to 14 point Helvetica is the only thing there should be. Why would there ever be another font?

31
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:20,259
Do we need 16, 17, 1800? How many fonts are there? 1800? How many fonts exist?

32
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:37,350
It's probably thousands of them. What's the point? There are millions of fonts. Why is it?

33
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:45,800
There are only three fonts that should exist. Reading things clearly. Birthday card.

34
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:55,930
You can be fun with that one. Birthday card. That's it. I can't think of another reason to

35
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:04,329
ever have another font. There's no other reason for other fonts besides those two.

36
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:13,300
Alright, rip Times New Roman. No, that one doesn't even have to exist either.

37
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:26,279
This should not be more fonts than there are serial brands. Something about that is not correct.

38
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:33,509
They can't even figure out how to make cornflakes fucking 500 times. They've only made it like 30

39
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:42,310
times. How can you? How do you make the letter H look six million times different than the last

40
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:53,689
time you made it? You can't. It's just three lines. It's one, two, three lines. Anyways,

41
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:59,689
before I get all worked up, I'm going to play Hitman now. I have the audio muted so you

42
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:11,399
shouldn't be able to hear it. It shouldn't hurt your ears. Make my own font. It would just be,

43
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:17,060
it would be just a few lines. Wait, you shouldn't be able to hear this.

44
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:29,180
Hold on, not yet. Hold on. Not yet. Now I have to do this fun thing where, oh god, where's my mouse?

45
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:35,899
Why is the window staying open? Close that, please. Don't turn off my computer. Okay, we'll go

46
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:44,730
starting, starting strong here. Okay, here we go. Get that off. Just give me one moment. Nice

47
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:56,329
transition there. I have to get this captured. Let's get it. Do not capture Goose Game. I want

48
00:07:56,329 --> 00:08:04,040
Hitman 2 done. There we are. You thought it was going to take me longer. It may have.

49
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:10,439
All right, I got the DLC installed. Hopefully it works. Otherwise, I'm going to be very sad.

50
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:23,129
Stop sweating and turn on face cam. Though, cut my nails though. I did do that. Those of you that

51
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:31,620
were yelling at me last night at the end of that stream, I appreciate it. So this two DLC

52
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:42,809
campaigns, those two missions that I haven't done, right? Campaign, Hitman 2. I did all these

53
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:55,590
already. So golden handshake and the last resort. All right. Remember to shave? Already did. You

54
00:08:55,590 --> 00:09:03,179
don't think I was already on top of that? I had to shave to the minute that the Twitch party is

55
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:09,769
going to start on Saturday. I shaved at exactly 7 30 p.m. last night. That's a lie because I was

56
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:16,230
still live. When did the stream end? Like 8 30 p.m. Pacific? That's when the Twitch party starts.

57
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:22,059
It's going to grow out. When I'm in like the Uber to get there, it is going to be perfectly

58
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:31,450
grown out. The last second when I step out of that cab, perfectly grown. So this one is brand new.

59
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:38,330
This one is not. This one is probably like a few months old. By the way, those of you that are

60
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:45,740
going to laugh at me for this, I have not played Hitman since the last time I streamed it. I don't

61
00:09:45,740 --> 00:10:02,820
even remember how to play. So that's going to be a thing. Bad, bad. I haven't played it in like a

62
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:28,980
year. I forget what happened. This is a whole game here.

63
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:34,740
Yeah, I'll turn the volume up in a second.

64
00:10:40,659 --> 00:10:42,419
I have to pay attention to this, though.

65
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:56,059
That's Troy Baker. That's Troy Baker, right?

66
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:07,639
You can always tell when it's Troy Baker because he elongates words.

67
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:19,370
I'm not nearly as talented as Troy Baker. I'm just telling you.

68
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,070
All right, let's go.

69
00:11:32,789 --> 00:11:36,070
You don't need to tell us. I'm just telling you.

70
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:55,590
I'm going to pay. Look, I got to pay attention. I can go through the basement, right?

71
00:11:55,590 --> 00:12:06,549
Right. So I've got to get three flash drives.

72
00:12:08,789 --> 00:12:13,909
And then they combine. I'm going into the basement.

73
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:30,059
Okay, give it to me clear. Break into the vault, get the hard drive rack, and get rid of the director.

74
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:43,929
Okay, break into the hard drive, steal the bank, break into the... All right, break the director,

75
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:57,799
steal the bank, eliminate Athena Savalas. Mission is now active. How do you swing?

76
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:05,850
I think it's a Q. Sound is too low. I got it. I got it. I got it. Hold on.

77
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:23,529
QRS. Okay, objective. Target Athena Savalas, retrieve the data, and exit the bank.

78
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:32,840
I got to get the data. Difficulty professional. That has to change. Wait, no,

79
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,200
that's what I played on before, right? Okay, I'm going to be the New Yorker.

80
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:53,100
Don't I have any DLC suits? Why is this taking so long? Should I just go for... All right,

81
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:59,399
I'm going to go into the winter sports suit, I think. I won't look out of place at all.

82
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:09,610
Okay, coin. That's good. My concealed weapon is my ICA-19. That looks all right. Starting location

83
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:16,340
bank entrance. I think I'm ready to go. Pray for my CPU, because the last time I played this game,

84
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,700
it was all fucked up. Difficulty master. No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

85
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,580
Professional. Okay, here we go. And I'm going to turn it up a little bit louder.

86
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:48,919
That should do it. Hey, now you can hear. Let's go. I forget. What's the plan?

87
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:55,720
Welcome to New York, 47. I'll get it again. Milton Fitzpatrick Bank is open for business,

88
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,759
but it seems there's some sort of investigation underway. Expect increased security.

89
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:07,129
Your target, Director Athena Savalas, can be found in her top floor office,

90
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:10,330
overlooking the iconic... Stop chugging. What are you talking about?

91
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:15,610
Head of security, Mateo Perez, is roaming between the vault area and the teller hall.

92
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:20,490
What are you talking about? What? And head of accounts, Fabian Mann,

93
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:24,409
can be found on the investment banker floor... What, am I dropping a shitload of frames?

94
00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:26,809
...driving the internal investigation. That shouldn't be happening.

95
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:30,730
Remember, we need to secure the data from the bank's reinforced vault.

96
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,889
This is a lie. Or, alternatively, acquire three hard drives...

97
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:38,649
I'm supposed to pay attention to this. ...and two lieutenants, Mann and Perez.

98
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:40,809
Now I lost everything. Good luck, 47.

99
00:15:41,690 --> 00:16:01,139
Hold on. Are you guys actually fucking with me? Oh no. Oh no. You weren't. Were you?

100
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:08,649
I have to keep this out. They didn't see this. Oh shit. All right. God damn it.

101
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:20,600
Why does my computer have to suck so bad? All right. What do I... Let me save it.

102
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,960
Manual save slot. How about... None of these matter. This one right here.

103
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:40,019
Okay. Eliminate Athena Savalas and obtain the data. You got it. I need to... I don't remember how to

104
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:59,080
play. That's Q. Retrieve vault data core. Three of them. Okay.

105
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:10,970
Those of you that are wondering why I did this, I'm making sure my CPU can handle it.

106
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:31,109
Okay. I can handle it. Maybe... No, it can't. It can't handle it? It wasn't silky smooth?

107
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:54,900
Wait. That wasn't silky smooth? What? God damn it. No! I have to...

108
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:00,630
Hold on. Hold on a second. I might have to restart the stream.

109
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:23,059
Can I do that during the stream? Hold on a minute. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Damn it. No.

110
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:29,380
It's because... I have to restart the stream. All right. I'll be right... I'll be right back.

111
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:39,140
It's because when I... Last time I played a console game, I turned my CPU preset down and shit. I'll

112
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:51,460
be right back. Like in 10 seconds. All right. We're good. We're good, right? I think we're good.

113
00:18:52,539 --> 00:19:09,980
Hey. How's everybody doing? Did it work? Confirm with me that this worked. Yes, it did it. Yeah.

114
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:15,900
I have my CPU preset so fucking high. So low, I mean. All right. Okay. Hopefully not a thousand

115
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:27,990
of you left. You probably did. But now we're silky smooth. We should be. I left. All right.

116
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:32,069
Hold on. I got to do this too. Like, I'm sorry guys, but like this is... My computer sucks.

117
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:37,509
It really shouldn't suck this much. Do I have to take tech... All right. I'm going to take this

118
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:46,019
down to two. I just got this computer. I got a 1080 in here. That's not good anymore, is it?

119
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:54,619
Shit. That's not good anymore. That's like not good at all anymore. I have a 4770K. That's good,

120
00:19:54,619 --> 00:20:00,140
right? No, I don't. What do I have? Somebody do hash... Somebody turn on exclamation point.

121
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:05,339
Whatever the... Hold on. The 60... I know what it is. Quiet!

122
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:28,950
I'm sorry. Why is this stuttering so much? Have a good day. Okay. Hold on a minute here. Ruby Red,

123
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:34,549
famous month-breaking investigative journalist, is in the bank. Known for her fierce skills at

124
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:39,269
digging up dirt and her excellent nose for scandal. She's definitely up to something.

125
00:20:39,269 --> 00:20:44,549
She's up to something. Might be worth following her around the bank, 47. Okay. Let's see where she

126
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:55,640
goes. Investigate Ruby Red. All right. Why is that happening now? Teddy, it's me. I'm at the bank now.

127
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:02,660
This game fucking hates my computer. Somebody called it too. Don't you dare dump this story,

128
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:09,660
Ted. I will find that report. Oh, she's listening. I'm sorry. I'm not interrupting your phone call.

129
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:28,490
I'm testing my stream settings. Don't you dare dump this story, Ted. I'm the story of the year.

130
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:34,359
Director Ceballos has been at extreme recklessness and the public deserve to know that. My informant

131
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:37,960
will come through. Just make sure... I look like such a fucking idiot right now.

132
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:40,440
I'm doing v-sync. That's right.

133
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:47,910
Okay. Stocks are gonna plummet. They actually fixed everything.

134
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:59,559
I'm so out of place. All right. Email the documents. Investigate. I gotta investigate

135
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:01,640
the whistleblower. Wait, was that the person she was on the phone with?

136
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:13,559
Why were you talking on the phone? I can't get in there. All right. Hold on. I gotta get a suit.

137
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:16,039
Yeah, I can't let you pass. I'm sorry, sir. All right. Let me...

138
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,990
All right. You got a good cop, bad cop routine going. Appreciate it. Wait, I don't want to get on

139
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:37,609
camera. All right. Let me see the map. We got a bathroom. Lost and found. All right. Let me...

140
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:44,329
I don't know what to do with the bat. I don't know what to do. I need a new... I can't be a guy in...

141
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:55,289
I got the corner of my foot touched that. What? Oh, because I picked this up. I picked up...

142
00:22:55,289 --> 00:23:03,450
How do I put it down? I didn't do that. I had nothing to do with that.

143
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:12,329
Look, it's obviously a wet floor. I didn't kill anybody. How do I put this down?

144
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:23,500
Hold on. Wait. I can go over here now. This is the security check. I just got it.

145
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:33,990
Let's go. Wait. Do I have the door lock on? Unlocker. All right. There's another cop up there,

146
00:23:33,990 --> 00:24:07,220
though. I got to get the janitor. I got to find somebody. Somebody over there. Where am I? Okay.

147
00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:30,680
Why do I care more about this in the game? Wait. How do I get to my...

148
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:41,670
How do I get to my... I don't know how to get to my inventory. How do I get to the inventory?

149
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:54,490
What the fuck was that? Did somebody puke? Who just puked? There's a Q. It's not Q. You want me

150
00:24:54,490 --> 00:25:05,109
to punch somebody. Which mouse button is it? E. Space. Middle mouse. No, that's gun. R. S.

151
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:25,319
I. No, but how do I get the fast one? Tab? V. It's not V. Scroll wheel. It's not scroll wheel.

152
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:40,579
Hold on. Mouse and keyboard. Key bindings. Interact. Agility actions. Pick up. Use items G.

153
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:48,869
Aim. Shoot. Reload. Instinct. Camera. Shoulder. Crouch. Holster. Precision aim. Zoom in. Zoom out.

154
00:25:49,430 --> 00:26:00,380
Holster. Inventory. I. Isn't there a spinner? Font change. Am I thinking of a different hitman?

155
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:11,670
Okay. So, all right. That's a different hitman. All right. I need to go investigate. I need a

156
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:24,309
different clothes. How long does it take for a janitor to come in here? You? Thank you. No.

157
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:54,009
It's I too. All right. Just investigating distraction. Who is? I forgot. How stupid this

158
00:26:54,009 --> 00:27:07,210
game is. Okay. I need to investigate the whistle. I need somebody's outfit. Can I put my back against

159
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:11,690
the wall and do like the knock knock solid snake thing? All right. Hold on. Wait. I got an idea.

160
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:23,750
Somebody just get the fuck in here. See? I told you. Janitor. Janitor. Janitor. Janitor. Janitor.

161
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:51,400
Good to go. Damn. Janitor. Okay. Fresh disguise. What else you got? Coin. Come here. Can I fit

162
00:27:51,400 --> 00:28:02,490
two people in here? Yeah. We got a raid? Tyler Vic Vicker. Thanks for the raid. Welcome guys.

163
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:07,849
Playing Hitman. DLC. I'm trying to relearn how to play the game because I don't know how to play it.

164
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:12,410
I do this thing where I don't ever put me on a bicycle because you know like oh once you

165
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:16,089
learn how to ride a bike you'll know how to do it forever. No, I won't. If I got on a bike right

166
00:28:16,089 --> 00:28:20,329
now I learned how to ride a bike when I was like 10. If I got on a bike right now I would fall over.

167
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:32,099
All right. So I'm good. I'm the janitor. So now I have to end. What's going on?

168
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:52,299
Why is it illegal for the janitor to be up here? God damn it. Why is it? What's wrong with this guy?

169
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:56,460
Why does he hate me so much? All right. Wait. There's something else going on.

170
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,460
What's this story?

171
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:11,180
Nerves maybe? Oh wait. Hold on. So the job interview.

172
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:16,859
Final applicant was seen going into the bathroom. Yeah. Okay. Where is it?

173
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:30,579
Thanks. I want to do that instead. Wait. Can I blend in with a mop? What's this thing?

174
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:50,950
There's earphones on this desk. Save. Save it. Save it right here. Manual save. Hey stop this

175
00:29:50,950 --> 00:30:01,480
ridiculous behavior at once. I'm sorry. I just want the earphones. I got them. Free earphones.

176
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,640
All right. Let's go back to the guy that's thrown up here.

177
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:22,680
Where is this? Wait. He was in here? Oh I have to. The door is locked. Oh I get it. Okay.

178
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:43,509
How do I knock on the door? Is he going to come out? I got to be ready for him when he comes out.

179
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:55,799
When he comes out. Should I? Is this the exit? How do I get in there?

180
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,940
Oh this is still flooding. Is there a way to? Wait.

181
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:15,930
I need to get in this bathroom. Oh this is bad. I don't want to do that.

182
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:28,410
I'm fucking ruining this bathroom. Is anybody in here? Knock knock.

183
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:37,109
I need to unlock this door. Doesn't the janitor have every single key?

184
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:46,970
I thought that was the thing. Shoot him through the door and then I would never get in.

185
00:31:46,970 --> 00:32:02,740
No. I need a I need a key. Like a security. I need a security key. I'm kind of just collecting

186
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:10,549
stuff. All right. Wait. Hold on. Soda can. Nice. Okay. This is not Skyrim. I don't know why I'm

187
00:32:10,549 --> 00:32:13,589
picking up all this useless shit. Could I take this guy's coffee when he puts it down?

188
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:26,380
I'm waiting. All right. I need that guy right there. I need a new outfit. I have to get in that

189
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:58,789
room. Can I open the door with the crowbar? I'll try it. Don't you dare.

190
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:05,819
I have too much stuff. I got to disguise as the applicant. Does he have a key card?

191
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:19,130
I'm gonna get um. Is there enough room in here? Put his face in the toilet. You guys are fucked

192
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:37,750
up. Look at the toilet. T.O.S. I'm just gonna turn this off. I don't need it anymore.

193
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:50,460
All right. I now approach the reception. I'm the applicant for the work for the job.

194
00:33:52,569 --> 00:34:03,529
That's the target up there. I'm like to the interview. Feeling better I hope.

195
00:34:03,529 --> 00:34:10,489
Should I let HR know you're ready for the final interview? Yes. I feel like a new man. I'm ready.

196
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:19,320
Wonderful. Follow me please. It's right down here. Best of luck in your interview 47.

197
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:29,130
I thought that was her. All right. Follow you. I hate when they do this shit in MMOs.

198
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:33,369
I don't want to walk faster than the NPC. I want to walk with the NPC.

199
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:40,039
Like why is there no match speed? This is the interview.

200
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:55,960
I bring my lucky wrench to interviews apparently. Mr. Thomas. Okay. Let's sit down.

201
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:01,559
Cool.

202
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,440
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Can we do the interview still?

203
00:35:18,889 --> 00:35:29,050
Did I get the job? Did I get the job? Oh shit. Okay. Oh my god.

204
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:56,409
I'm just doing my job. That's all. How is somebody not figuring this out?

205
00:35:56,969 --> 00:36:30,010
Wait. Let's go. Like you'll ever get me. These games are fucking so funny.

206
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:34,329
Best of luck in your interview 47. Let's see where this will lead you to.

207
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:42,469
All right. I'm going to get stuck here I think. I don't want to get seen by the camera.

208
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:56,090
Shh. God damn it. I got seen. Press alt. Why? Alt?

209
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,000
Okay. I'm ready for the interview.

210
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:09,800
Oh.

211
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,800
Personality test.

212
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:24,119
Kick this off. Okay. I'm ready. Okay. So this is a very simple test.

213
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:27,880
All you do is pick a card and tell us what you see there.

214
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,920
Now it's important to point out that there are no right or wrong answers.

215
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,320
Clearly me. It's just to give us a better impression of who you are on a psychological level.

216
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,280
Does that make sense? Why would they be doing this?

217
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:43,079
All right. Mr. Thomas. Did you see my resume? If you will please pick the card.

218
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:47,400
I want the brown university. God damn it. Opportunity. Opportunity.

219
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:57,139
Now here's the fucking 500 IQ play. You know, the Forbes magazine over there.

220
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:01,099
They're going to be like, wait a minute. That wasn't part of the plan.

221
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:11,590
Oh, I understand. He went completely out of the box. Opportunity. I don't know. This one.

222
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:17,929
No, this one. This one. All right. Now look at it closely. Take a few moments.

223
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:26,010
Then tell me, do you see an animal or an object? It's clearly a bird. I see. What kind of animal? An eagle bird.

224
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:33,659
An eagle perhaps. Eagle. Very interesting. A forceful animal. Anything else? It's

225
00:38:34,699 --> 00:38:42,699
feeding on something. Feeding on what? A carcass. The scene is reflected in a pool of blood

226
00:38:42,699 --> 00:38:48,139
flowing from the body. Okay. It's a vulture feeding on someone else's kill.

227
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:56,679
This is for a bank clerk job? Mr. Thomas. Yes. Brutal even. Right. Very interesting observation,

228
00:38:56,679 --> 00:39:03,239
Mr. Thomas. Not what we expected, but that's perfectly fine. Let's take the next one, shall

229
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:08,840
we? The next one. Pick any of the remaining cards that make you think of execution, please.

230
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:14,679
I mean, it obviously is going to be the one with the Hitman 47 with his two pistols,

231
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:20,300
but this could also be one. I'm not going to go for the easy one.

232
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:27,719
Oh, very good. This is an interesting one. What do you see here? Take in the whole image, please.

233
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:33,960
And in as much detail as possible. It's a river. It's a river with rocks all around it. Or it's

234
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:41,190
a stone head. I see a big pile of money earned performing questionable actions.

235
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:45,750
And how do you feel about that? I'm trying to just completely bomb this interview.

236
00:39:46,469 --> 00:39:52,550
Very good, Mr. Thomas. Well, that's a very creative interpretation, Mr. Thomas.

237
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:56,789
I think we've just got time for the last card. Please proceed.

238
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:01,030
This last card should hopefully make you think of prosperity.

239
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:10,780
So my experience in the banking world, I was a teller at Bank of America for four years.

240
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:15,670
I've handled money for a lot. You don't care about that?

241
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:22,679
Whenever you're ready. Okay, sure. I'll pick the card. I'll pick this one.

242
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:26,280
Good choice. Tell me, what is the first thing you've seen?

243
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:34,039
I've also been I've handled gold before and figure in a large coat. Perspective skewed

244
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:42,230
as if I'm looking at him from the ground. He's got something in his hands. I go on. He's on

245
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:49,349
dual firearms, large caliber pistols. I see. What else do you see? He's just finished a job

246
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:56,949
perfectly executed. And who is this man? It's me. Very, very interesting, Mr. Thomas.

247
00:40:56,949 --> 00:41:03,510
Well, that was certainly unexpected. I think the results are pretty clear. Did I get it?

248
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:09,750
We don't have the perfect match for the investment banker position. However, you're just the man we

249
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:14,550
need for our accounting department. I have to agree with Kevin here. We need someone a little

250
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:21,510
more cutthroat for the top tier here. This is when they lean in and wink. It's really dive into

251
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:27,989
character as it were. But on a positive note, I want you to wink wink. I want you to beat the

252
00:41:27,989 --> 00:41:32,949
shit out of people I don't like. Great point, Melissa. There's no need to turn this little

253
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:38,150
setback into a complete failure. Someone with your particular set of skills would be perfect.

254
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:41,909
I'll take it. When do I start? Well, aren't you an eager beaver?

255
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:46,230
Well, we expect you to come in tomorrow at eight. Welcome on board, Mr. Thomas.

256
00:41:47,510 --> 00:42:03,849
Oh, I got it. Oh, I did it all correct. I didn't even mean to. I did it. Now what? They're both

257
00:42:03,849 --> 00:42:15,059
just leaving their office? Okay, bye. Time to rifle through your desk. Okay, cool. Close this

258
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:20,940
shit. Turn the lights off too. Let's make it atmospheric. No, close. Okay, quickly. What do

259
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:27,019
I got? Coffee. We got something in your desk. Your computer. Hack his computer. Take his pen.

260
00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:33,369
What should I do here? What should I do? It's a bust of his head, I think. Okay.

261
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:42,869
Nothing else. Well, I got the job. What are you talking about? I got the job.

262
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:57,289
Restart. What? I got the... Didn't I get the job? They gave me the wrong job. That's a win, man.

263
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:14,150
It was me. It was me.

264
00:43:22,949 --> 00:43:25,269
Wait, hold on. Are they... I thought they were going to...

265
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:53,769
All right, so I did it wrong? That's too... That's too... I saved over it. No? Okay, right here.

266
00:43:54,329 --> 00:44:09,289
There's an auto save that saved me. Tell me what this reminds you of.

267
00:44:09,289 --> 00:44:24,679
Okay. No, wait. I can't... I screwed it up, guys. I saved over. I thought I got the job. I thought

268
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:41,820
I got a job. I thought I got a job. I didn't get the job. I got a job. Go further back? But then I

269
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:52,230
look at how far back this is. I'm gonna get distracted. All right, I'll try. I'll try. I'm

270
00:44:52,230 --> 00:45:03,940
gonna try it. I'm gonna go very... I'm gonna go very, very fast. Oh, god. I need another... Okay,

271
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:10,860
I need the bathroom. I need crowbar. I need bathroom. I don't even... I don't remember... I

272
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:21,699
don't remember how I got in there. I gotta watch out, though. All right. Well, let's go down here.

273
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:39,719
Make the guy fall again. I can't just relive the whole thing. What is this? No. I'm too stressed.

274
00:45:40,599 --> 00:46:03,690
I'm not stressed. What are you talking about? These guys have guns. I'm getting inside my own...

275
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:17,030
Where's the bathroom here? All right. This guy right here. Bathroom. You're not allowed to go

276
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:36,219
in there, right? You're allowed to go... Is this like public space? No. Okay. What? It's a zoo?

277
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:40,940
All right. This way. I need to find the... There we go. Wet floor sign. This is the part I remember.

278
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:57,260
It's gonna happen. Here it comes. She absorbed all the water. She absorbed the water.

279
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:09,610
She must be so... She's just like... She's soaking.

280
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:13,860
Not why they're looking for me. I told you this wasn't gonna work.

281
00:47:14,659 --> 00:47:27,800
Create a water leak. All right. What about over here?

282
00:47:33,539 --> 00:47:41,900
There's the janitor. Money out of the ATM? Hold on. Is this like free money?

283
00:47:42,699 --> 00:47:56,739
Why is it a slot machine? You just gotta know what you're doing. That's all.

284
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:15,929
Yes. That guy said yes. It is a slot machine. Okay. Here we go. What's up? Shit. Get out of here.

285
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:22,969
It's in the house. Come on. I need this guy's costume.

286
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:43,989
If she's here, we are all in big trouble. You sink? I mean... No. No. You.

287
00:48:47,030 --> 00:49:25,590
I peeked out. That was me. All right. Janitor key. Holy shit. I got the janitor key.

288
00:49:26,309 --> 00:49:34,179
All right. I'm good. That guy left. Have a great day.

289
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:56,650
Okay. I need to save the game here. No. Didn't wash hands. Okay. So now

290
00:49:57,289 --> 00:50:10,730
I'm going up here. That guy can see. Can I walk into this? I have the janitor key. This is fine.

291
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:20,199
No, it's not. I'm not allowed in there. I'm a security guard. Why would I not be allowed

292
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:38,920
over there? All right. Hold on. There's like a wardrobe this way. I'm going a completely

293
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:46,250
different way than I went last time. All right. Hold on. What is that? I want that. Whatever it

294
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:56,150
is. Give it to me. Propane flask. I don't want this actually. No. I have to put this down.

295
00:50:56,710 --> 00:51:05,219
I just showed it to him. I just showed it to him.

296
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,500
All right. I have to reload.

297
00:51:24,739 --> 00:51:44,659
That activates it? Wait. What? I forgot how much fun this game was.

298
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:58,139
All right. Let's go. I got to go this way. Up the stairs. Just avoid the random police

299
00:51:58,139 --> 00:52:08,440
officers that are going to be staring at me. Just run by. Made it. Kind of. What's with this cube?

300
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:20,090
Hold on. What's the cube? I need to know what's in the cube. What? Okay. All right. I'm not going

301
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:35,530
to fail the interview this time. Wait. This is something new. Wait. This is the whistleblower.

302
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:48,170
I hit a bit of an obstacle here. No. Nobody's discovered anything, but for some reason,

303
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:54,329
the security is super high. So that's why he's fired? I don't think I can get to the documents

304
00:52:54,329 --> 00:53:02,199
safely. There's some sort of investigation going on. We kind of want to be left alone.

305
00:53:02,199 --> 00:53:10,840
Okay. Fine. Do you mind? Fine. He's discovered anything, but for some reason, the security is

306
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:19,289
super high today. I don't think I can get to the documents safely. There's some sort of investigation

307
00:53:19,289 --> 00:53:28,940
going on, and they're specifically looking for the file. I hit the file in a safety deposit box in

308
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:39,099
the basement. Keys were on the desk. This whistleblowing thing sounds great on paper,

309
00:53:39,099 --> 00:53:50,940
but I am telling you, it's pretty damn terrifying. Let me save it here. Locate the deposit box key.

310
00:53:52,809 --> 00:54:10,760
All right. Where is that? That way. All right. Can I scan my ass? I'm sorry. Don't mind me.

311
00:54:18,739 --> 00:54:46,219
Do you have anything on you? Nothing? Apple. All right. I got to go to... Wait. Rat poison. Get it.

312
00:54:49,130 --> 00:55:06,139
All right. Locate the safety deposit box key, which is this way. I'm not allowed in there though.

313
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:12,969
Hmm. That's the head of security here. Mateo Perez. Who? He'll be holding one of the three

314
00:55:12,969 --> 00:55:27,900
backup data disks. Who? This guy right here? This person right here? That's the only person

315
00:55:27,900 --> 00:56:05,820
that's here. That's the first backup data disk secured. Two more to locate. Shit.

316
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:28,360
Somebody has to come help. I have to make my escape. My fingerprints are all over that, right?

317
00:56:29,239 --> 00:56:32,840
Yeah. Look at it. I don't even wear gloves. My fingerprints are... Oh, no. I don't even

318
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:39,880
not have fingerprints. Nobody comes over here, right? Okay. I'm good. Let's go. Can I get the

319
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:48,070
knife? Oh, that's disgusting. Okay. Give me the apple. I was never here. Wait. Can I dress as

320
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:52,469
this person? Nope. Okay. Hold on. I got the safety deposit box key. I got to go

321
00:56:53,110 --> 00:57:09,829
up here. I'm freaking out. Okay. Save the game in a different spot. Okay. Wait. I have bloody

322
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:28,500
footprints? No, I don't. Who is looking at me? What is this? Turn on frosted glass?

323
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:37,260
Oh, nice. This is a little safe area. All right. I gotta keep that. I gotta remind myself to come

324
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:51,159
in here. So, I gotta get in there and get the key. I'm allowed in here. There's only one person's

325
00:57:51,159 --> 00:58:21,659
person at the desk over there. I can get it. Shit. Is anybody else in here? No. Don't poison the

326
00:58:21,659 --> 00:58:36,019
water bottle. What am I doing? Okay. The key is... Where is it? Nothing. All right. Looking for the

327
00:58:36,019 --> 00:59:09,460
desk. Looking for the key. Wait. Is it in there? It's not one of these desks. Got it. Holding

328
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:31,639
ear pods. I'm gonna save it here. No. A new one. Can I take a bite out of this? All right. Time to

329
00:59:31,639 --> 00:59:37,400
go to the... I gotta go down to the basement. Now, how am I gonna get down to the basement?

330
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:47,980
I have to go all the way down here, I think. But will these guys try to stop me? No one's found

331
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:57,400
this yet. That's good. I gotta get down here. These guys will let me through, right? Good afternoon,

332
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:11,769
sir. All right. It's in there. This is the vault, 47. The data core should be behind that large

333
01:00:11,769 --> 01:00:18,630
steel door. Looking for the data core. All right. Incriminating evidence. Well, at least it's not as

334
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:25,829
bad as that time in Queens. Remember that? The 6,000 semi-incinerated files we had to tape together?

335
01:00:25,829 --> 01:00:33,030
Don't remind me. I'm just saying, maybe this isn't so terrible after all. There are always worse

336
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:41,110
cases out there. I guess I mostly... Got it. ...to staff or ask around if people have seen a folder

337
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:48,230
full of secrets. We could be here weeks and not find anything. Any money in here? You don't have

338
01:00:48,230 --> 01:01:06,230
to love it. Yeah, I guess you're right. Oh, shit. There is money. There's a money key. All right. I

339
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:33,750
got the money key. Now I have to fuck with this guy for a minute. He was gonna call something in,

340
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:37,829
but he just got embarrassed. I think he thought he fell off the chair. Hey, this is... Oh, wait a

341
01:01:37,829 --> 01:01:56,300
minute. I was just sleeping. Never mind. Everything's fine. Right before he dozes off. All right. He's

342
01:01:56,300 --> 01:02:09,639
just dozed off. There it is. You know when you're right about to fall asleep, you get ripped out of

343
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:13,619
it. He's gonna go back to bed in front of these guys.

344
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:32,969
How could you go back to sleep? Ready? He hit his head pretty hard. I got plenty of shit to throw at

345
01:02:32,969 --> 01:02:58,360
you. Wait, I think the net... No. Whatevs. If his mouth opens, can I get it right in his mouth?

346
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:30,519
Ah, there we go. Now he wants to investigate. What did he just take? Ready? One, two, three.

347
01:03:31,719 --> 01:03:39,909
Aha. Okay. This is where we end up. There's some kind of fracas down here. I'm having a look around.

348
01:03:39,909 --> 01:04:23,099
This is gonna be so horrible. Hey. Right when he goes to bed. Oh. He's up. Let's put him up.

349
01:04:23,099 --> 01:04:41,019
Okay. Hold on. Will he remember this? I'm trying to sit him back in the chair. This is not even

350
01:04:41,019 --> 01:04:45,380
that bad. Everybody knows this guy sleeps on the job anyways. All right. I need to pick up all the

351
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:58,579
things I threw. Okay. That's everything I had, right? Unconscious witness. I'm gonna be an

352
01:04:58,579 --> 01:05:12,170
unconscious witness. Wait. He saw my face. I can't, like, dump rat poison down his throat.

353
01:05:12,809 --> 01:05:16,170
All right. That's fucked up. I can't. I just said that out loud. All right. He'll be fine.

354
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:30,619
I was trying to, like, plant the ear pods on him. All right. Whatever. He'll be up for a while.

355
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:56,300
I gotta go to Ruby Red. How has nobody found you yet? Reload. Oh, that's right. I did. I saved it

356
01:05:56,300 --> 01:06:09,719
right before I did all that. You're right. The blood has been cleaned up. All right. Let's go.

357
01:06:18,179 --> 01:06:22,420
Should I be actually working with Ruby Red? I'm gonna get double crossed here. That's what

358
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:29,449
happens in these games. Now the blood is there this time. All right. I got files. What are you?

359
01:06:29,449 --> 01:06:39,719
What's in it for me? How are you? Hmm. It is.

360
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:59,269
Sounds like Miss Red has quite a scoop on her hands. Yeah. My guess is this will cause a major

361
01:06:59,269 --> 01:07:14,420
market upset. No, no, no. No photos of me. All right. We need the other data disks. Got it.

362
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:22,889
Data disk objective is there's one down here. There's a data core. All right. Let me go down

363
01:07:22,889 --> 01:07:30,260
here. What was the other thing that I had? I had some more intel. No, it was objectives.

364
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:39,019
No, it was intel, wasn't it? I already got this one. The whistleblower got that one.

365
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:44,869
Okay. I got, I need one more. There's another one down this way. Let's go here.

366
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:53,300
I need to get the job. All right. I'll get the job. Where's the guy that's puking?

367
01:07:55,800 --> 01:08:15,639
Insider trading. What? Oh, God. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

368
01:08:15,639 --> 01:08:20,279
No, drop, drop, drop, drop down, drop down, drop down. How do I drop down? How do I drop?

369
01:08:21,079 --> 01:08:46,279
How do you drop down? I can't just let go. Stock is crashing. Wait, what? Where? I need to,

370
01:08:46,279 --> 01:09:05,140
where's the stock? Where are the stocks crashing? Where's the puke? Where's the guy that's throwing

371
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:23,109
up in the bathroom? I don't see him anywhere. Wasn't he supposed to be in here? Oh, the other

372
01:09:23,109 --> 01:09:48,619
side. Oh, fuck. Second floor. Right. Oh, God damn it. The guy with the machine gun. All right. All

373
01:09:48,619 --> 01:09:56,920
right. I'm surrendering. I'm surrendering. You gotta be kidding. Just a little bit closer.

374
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:18,710
What? It's not, it's not a wet floor. Somebody. All right. Well, what was it over here? Second

375
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:32,970
floor in the second bathroom. Kind of, I gotta be a gamer. I can handle it. Don't worry. I can

376
01:10:32,970 --> 01:10:42,180
handle it. I didn't save after this, but it's all right. I'm just going to run up there.

377
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:55,859
Straight, left, right, up, skip. Don't step in the blood and get it all over me.

378
01:10:59,979 --> 01:11:06,649
There you go. I got something for you. Is that, is that what I think it is? Uh-huh. Yes.

379
01:11:07,449 --> 01:11:15,270
Just make sure the information will be put to good use. Oh, you can bank on that for you. What's

380
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:21,189
your role in this? I'm not important. Good luck. It sounds like Miss Red has quite a scoop on her

381
01:11:21,189 --> 01:11:27,109
hands. My guess is this will cause a major market upset, which is sure to bring the director out

382
01:11:27,109 --> 01:11:30,310
from her fortified office. Oh, it's as if she comes out. All right. Here we go.

383
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:35,560
Going through bathroom time. Look if a guy in the bathroom.

384
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:51,779
Save game. Go get, go play the stock market before everything crashes. All right. So then where was

385
01:11:51,779 --> 01:11:57,180
the bathroom? Am I in the wrong fucking place? I thought I was supposed to go up and then right.

386
01:11:57,819 --> 01:12:18,409
Isn't that like where I am? Go by. I'm up, I think I'm up way too high. All right. I gotta be careful

387
01:12:18,409 --> 01:12:38,979
here. He's not in here. It's the other side. Oh, fuck. What? What are you up to? Who are you?

388
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:57,020
You, you're starting to piss me off. Hey, I know you can hear me. I'm talking. Who the fuck is this

389
01:12:57,020 --> 01:13:11,180
guy? Oh man. No, no, no, no, not the gun. Um, fuck. Jesus. Thank Christ. How did you get up?

390
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:48,180
God, come on. It's a fucking three stooges episode. Oh, it was the other side. Shit. All right. I'm

391
01:13:48,180 --> 01:14:10,390
back. Everybody has the little dollop on their head here. It's not this bathroom this way. Wait a

392
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:20,119
minute. I don't have a crowbar. Whatever. All right. I'm gonna save right here. You very clearly don't

393
01:14:20,119 --> 01:14:32,890
work here. Oh, this is the stock area. Trespassing. Get a note. I'm trespassing. It's okay. I got the

394
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:37,659
note. What is it? Intel. Notice from the bank's head of security mentions that recent issues with

395
01:14:37,659 --> 01:14:43,180
the building's wireless internet have gotten director Sal Vallas so high strung that fixing

396
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:49,260
the wifi in her office always takes priority. If the wifi in the director's office breaks down,

397
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:55,699
IT is allowed full and immediate access to the area. No questions asked. Okay. I gotta get,

398
01:14:55,699 --> 01:15:18,149
I gotta be an IT guy. Don't see me. Don't see me. Don't see me. Don't see me. Is this an IT guy?

399
01:15:18,789 --> 01:15:22,680
I don't know. Don't they, they wait to highs and shit, right? Investment banker.

400
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:41,340
You have anything else? Holy shit. Wait a minute. The guy's doing coke. Wait, what? Hold on a second.

401
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:54,020
I want him to wake up and then do coke naked and die.

402
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:05,510
Can you, how do you wake somebody up?

403
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:12,979
Get up. If I make a loud noise, will he get up? Can I give his clothes back?

404
01:16:28,409 --> 01:16:42,420
The guards wake him up. Okay. Reload and poison coke. How am I going to do that? He's just going

405
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:57,989
to be staring at me. Hold on. Just dump poison on it while he smokes. Okay. It's this way.

406
01:16:58,710 --> 01:17:05,130
He comes into this bathroom. Is it just here? He just, who just has coke just sitting here?

407
01:17:05,850 --> 01:17:25,399
What? This is just community coke. Hey, uh, who are you? I'm sorry. It's all yours.

408
01:17:27,989 --> 01:17:46,149
Answer me when I'm talking to you. Identify yourself. Oh, the veins are popping. Some

409
01:17:46,149 --> 01:17:52,779
psycho's trying to kill people. He's got his hands around someone's neck. Hey, please, I need help.

410
01:17:53,579 --> 01:18:18,729
I was behind the door. How would you see that? All right. I gotta go faster. Okay. Then I'm

411
01:18:18,729 --> 01:18:45,449
going to go in behind him. Wait, can I hide in this? Yes. God damn it. I just want to watch you do

412
01:18:45,449 --> 01:19:38,359
coke and die. What happened? He didn't do anything. Is he just sick because he's sick? He's still sick

413
01:19:38,359 --> 01:20:09,079
though. He's ready to fight. Jesus Christ. That guy was the problem. I thought it was me. That

414
01:20:09,079 --> 01:20:29,720
guy was the problem. That's so funny. I'm sitting here so concerned that they're chasing me.

415
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:34,199
Okay. I'm only doing this one more time and then I have to, I have to do something else.

416
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:56,500
Can you do the coke? No. You got to get him sick and then high and then him running around outside.

417
01:20:57,060 --> 01:21:23,159
Right. Okay. I'll go for it. I don't feel so good. Where are the bathrooms?

418
01:21:31,539 --> 01:21:33,859
He doesn't know where the bathroom is.

419
01:21:40,279 --> 01:21:41,720
Why would you puke in there?

420
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:52,869
Wait, wait, wait. Give me that wristwatch. Don't mind me. I'm just going to turn on the water.

421
01:21:52,869 --> 01:22:01,029
Help me out a little bit. Wait, hold on. He's not going to slip in that, is he?

422
01:22:01,029 --> 01:22:20,630
I'm just making it worse. All right. Here. Now. I just broke his watch.

423
01:22:20,630 --> 01:22:52,279
Give me the watch back. I have to bring people over here. What? What was he doing?

424
01:22:53,699 --> 01:22:59,699
Is he wiping? Is he washing his hands in the water on the ground? This guy is fucking high.

425
01:23:41,979 --> 01:24:17,029
Look at this guy. He's doing something wrong. He's not. He's not going to go back. No, is he?

426
01:24:17,029 --> 01:24:34,979
It's high. All right. I've had my fun. Is he the only one that comes in here? I have to get him

427
01:24:34,979 --> 01:24:47,300
high and then hit him with muffins. Give me that watch. All right. Time for objective. I don't. Oh

428
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:58,250
God. Here he comes again. Oh shit. Don't turn. Is it still poisoned? He's not going to do it again,

429
01:24:58,250 --> 01:25:22,489
right? He just did it. All right. Muffin time. And then I'm going to fucking just let him run out.

430
01:25:22,489 --> 01:26:12,600
Okay. Get out there. Run out there and cause a problem. Oh my God. He doesn't. I don't know you.

431
01:26:34,170 --> 01:27:09,180
Is this real or are you just high? Imagine opening the door and the security guy would

432
01:27:09,819 --> 01:27:14,939
fucking apples at a guy who is lying on the ground. Holy shit. He's looking at the blood.

433
01:27:15,500 --> 01:28:04,729
This is bad. This is really bad. Holy shit, man. Okay. I'm ready. I still got the tie in the same

434
01:28:04,729 --> 01:28:11,350
spot that he had his tie. Hold on. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait

435
01:28:11,350 --> 01:28:22,380
a minute. Wait a minute. Oh, they're above. I have the Coke tie on right now. Okay. So I'm safe. I'm

436
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:40,149
going to save it by the way. Right here. I got to get to the IT room. Key card. Do I have, can I do

437
01:28:43,050 --> 01:28:51,079
card reader? Okay. I don't know. I don't know where I'm going. I've got, I'm going up restricted

438
01:28:51,079 --> 01:29:20,569
area, unauthorized accesses. Okay. So I'm guessing going up. I'm going up here. Okay. I love that.

439
01:29:20,569 --> 01:29:30,779
You can, you can save scum in this game. It's so wonderful. Milton Fitzpatrick,

440
01:29:33,380 --> 01:30:03,539
IT. Oh, I'm supposed to be up here. Right. I'm an investment banker. Ooh, coffee. I don't have any

441
01:30:03,539 --> 01:30:17,220
poison in the office in plain sight. I'm sorry. There's a guy that can see through my disguise

442
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:25,819
here. Mr. Man, we've been reviewing for just a few hours. It's not quite enough to get through

443
01:30:25,819 --> 01:30:30,939
the substantial amount of documentation here. You're supposed to be the best. I was told

444
01:30:32,899 --> 01:30:38,260
Mr. Man Kruger and Schultz has won best internal auditing awards. Nine years in a row. We are the

445
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:44,420
best, but we cannot buy low, sell high. I'll put my hand down now. Don't worry. You're pretty

446
01:30:44,420 --> 01:31:01,210
little head of shit. This guy's got a disc. I'm feeling pretty salty here, lady. Pizza. All right.

447
01:31:05,159 --> 01:31:09,960
I swear those people in IT need to get off their asses. You used all the right software on my laptop.

448
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:20,779
All right. Where's IT? Oh, that is Athena Savalas, billionaire banker,

449
01:31:20,779 --> 01:31:51,770
Providence Herald, and Bane of the middle class. Push her out the window quick. Get her out the

450
01:31:51,770 --> 01:32:25,340
window. Do it. I died with an apple in my hand. I need that guy's disc. He's got like, he's a,

451
01:32:25,340 --> 01:32:31,899
he used to go do like a colonic. No, I'm sorry. She can't take any calls right now. I suggest

452
01:32:31,899 --> 01:32:52,920
you call back later. Sir, are you with the... What the fuck is this? An iron, I guess.

453
01:33:37,350 --> 01:34:20,949
I gotta, I gotta stick with it. I haven't killed anybody. Last ditch. Where is she going?

454
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:35,960
What the fuck was that? Oh, she's got, she's, she's got like a bunch of like

455
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:42,810
people watching the stream. She's got four pocket medics. Take the principal to the safe location.

456
01:34:44,100 --> 01:35:16,220
No! Close the door on me. All right. I'm getting in there. No more fucking around. Distract guy at

457
01:35:16,220 --> 01:35:34,899
desk. Easy. Stay here and try not to get in my way. Okay, but be careful. No, you need to both be

458
01:35:34,899 --> 01:36:17,340
over there. Oh, come on. The alarm. Say what? Don't have a fuck with Coke tie. What's this? Oh, I need

459
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:23,479
that. Apple we got. Okay. So now I gotta get in there. I gotta get to IT.

460
01:36:24,279 --> 01:36:33,220
Do they labeled? Conference room, director's office. I need IT. Level two, level one,

461
01:36:35,159 --> 01:36:49,380
level zero, teller hall, level minus one. Where's the IT office? Security hub, interview, VIP,

462
01:36:49,380 --> 01:36:58,729
waiting lounge. Where's, there's no IT. Deposit boxes all the way down in the basement.

463
01:37:00,550 --> 01:37:08,619
All right. I got a, I got all the way up here though. I have the key. I need to get a different

464
01:37:08,619 --> 01:37:25,319
disguise. This is going to beep and all right. This is good. This shit in here that I can do.

465
01:37:25,319 --> 01:37:34,220
All right. Apricot. That's a smaller, more dense, compact apple. So that's good. That's good for me.

466
01:37:34,859 --> 01:38:06,819
Create water leak now. Clothes, iron. It's like a net gear. Does she just come and try to unplug it

467
01:38:06,819 --> 01:38:19,109
and plug it back in? Nope. She's going to figure it out. What'd she do though? She demands an IT

468
01:38:19,109 --> 01:38:53,460
person. Where'd he go? Somebody get IT up. Yeah. All right. Where's the IT guy? Get IT. We need Tim,

469
01:38:53,460 --> 01:39:21,449
the IT guy. All right. I gotta get the hell out of here. Tim, the IT guy. Gotta go down. Have you

470
01:39:21,449 --> 01:39:28,659
tried turning it on and turning it off again? She's asked for her assistant to get someone from IT

471
01:39:28,659 --> 01:39:31,220
to come up and look at it. This would be an excellent way to get close to the director.

472
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:39,859
I have to get down to IT and get a costume. Where am I now? Down. I gotta go down from here.

473
01:39:40,659 --> 01:40:13,590
Is he already up there? A guy on a computer up there. So which way does he have to go? No,

474
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:21,380
that's not a guy on a computer. Is he gonna come up these stairs? He has to come up these stairs.

475
01:40:21,380 --> 01:40:54,500
All right. So where is he? Fix the router. Let's go. It's gonna take a while to get up here.

476
01:40:54,500 --> 01:41:14,489
Are you guys sure somebody's gonna come up into this room? I think they were on the way up and

477
01:41:14,489 --> 01:41:18,090
I think they just found the body. That's the IT guy that's on the way up.

478
01:41:26,789 --> 01:41:34,329
I have to get back down there. Oh no, the IT guy found him. That's great. Oh my god.

479
01:41:40,460 --> 01:41:43,579
Why is the IT guy? It's always the IT department. They just do everything.

480
01:41:44,439 --> 01:41:58,359
They figure everything out. They don't get enough credit. I wonder how long I have to sit here for

481
01:41:58,359 --> 01:42:08,579
though. At what point does unplugging and plugging back in the router take precedence over dead guy

482
01:42:08,579 --> 01:42:27,829
with knife and head on the stairs? I don't know. We're gonna find out. Still searching. What is

483
01:42:27,829 --> 01:42:50,390
that down there? I have to go meet him down there. I do. Where did I save at last? I think I have to

484
01:42:50,390 --> 01:42:54,869
just run down to where that guy's dead and intercept him and leave two dead bodies there.

485
01:42:56,949 --> 01:43:16,579
You know what I'm saying? That's the play. Okay. I've got to get down to where that is.

486
01:43:17,539 --> 01:43:39,350
All right. Get down there quick. Where is it? Where is it? Oh shit. Where is it? Is that?

487
01:43:39,989 --> 01:44:00,010
Get out of my way. Fuck. God damn it. It's that guy. No, I can't. You gotta get ready. What a

488
01:44:00,010 --> 01:44:22,779
fucking idiot. Where is he? All right. Out into the right. Down the stairs. Go. Go. Okay. Okay.

489
01:44:22,779 --> 01:44:25,100
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Down here.

490
01:44:26,229 --> 01:44:43,800
Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. IT guy. Where is he? That's him I think. Right there.

491
01:44:58,550 --> 01:45:12,550
Who? What? What? Who found it? Oh, fuck. There he is. I gotta save right now. Over,

492
01:45:12,550 --> 01:45:20,810
over here. It's Ruby Red. Get out of here. Ruby Red. We're on the same team.

493
01:45:25,109 --> 01:45:37,130
Ruby Red. Get out of the way. Ruby. I'm sorry. No, Ruby. God damn it. I'm sorry. I have to.

494
01:45:40,810 --> 01:46:03,189
Ruby's gonna have to get hit in the head with an apple. She'll be fine. No, no. Why are you

495
01:46:03,189 --> 01:46:17,029
not knocked out? No. I'm like a fucking clown. I don't have anything else to throw.

496
01:46:21,619 --> 01:46:32,220
All right. We're on the same team. We're not on the same team. Don't make me do it. Don't. Don't.

497
01:46:34,439 --> 01:47:05,909
Shit. Why? Okay. I need to sit here for a second. Ruby, I'm sorry.

498
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:25,420
Over here. I need some assistance. What the? You didn't even fucking. We need help, please.

499
01:47:27,020 --> 01:47:33,100
Why would you come investigate? He investigated last time. All right. No fucking around. They're

500
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:52,949
both going down instantly. I have to. Here's the play. Person now. Oh, she just. She did a

501
01:47:52,949 --> 01:48:25,029
lemmings move. It's too gruesome to get my head around. Okay. She comes down. Go investigate.

502
01:48:25,989 --> 01:48:32,069
Both of you do it. I got to make this very clean. We're doing iron. They both are going to come up.

503
01:48:32,069 --> 01:48:40,380
Don't hit me, buddy. Watch this. Here we go. Someone help me.

504
01:48:59,300 --> 01:49:17,449
Okay. New plan. New plan. I have to get it. You have to go down now. Okay. You don't look.

505
01:49:18,409 --> 01:49:50,359
Hello. Got it. What are you firing? All right. I. We have to. I have to do something else. I have to.

506
01:49:50,359 --> 01:49:56,699
I have to throw. This is going to be hard. Okay. This is the one. I'm going to try it this time.

507
01:49:56,699 --> 01:50:00,220
This is going to be the one right now. Promise. Check this out. Ready? Without even a second

508
01:50:00,220 --> 01:50:12,680
thought, it's going to be hit her. Get body. Iron. Wait. He's going to come up. What a shock.

509
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:16,359
Come on up. Take a look. Get a closer look. I need some help over here. No, you don't.

510
01:50:16,359 --> 01:50:19,960
You need to take care of this. Oh my God. I'm trying to put the bodies higher.

511
01:50:21,239 --> 01:50:29,640
Fucking God. All right. I got to move on. I have to. This is the last time I'm going to try this.

512
01:50:29,640 --> 01:51:09,779
Guys, I need some backup. Nothing at my position.

513
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:41,979
Yeah. Still looking. Please. Why? Why did I do that? Oh, I'm so mad at myself. Why? I thought I

514
01:51:41,979 --> 01:51:50,069
could drop down all the way. All right. That's the play. Here's the play. Oh, okay. This is the play.

515
01:52:04,380 --> 01:52:21,539
So far. No. Okay. I have to run. I'm just going to hide in the box.

516
01:52:23,529 --> 01:52:33,670
Hide in the box. Turn on the panic room. Quick. Turn it on. Turn it. Go, go, go, turn it on.

517
01:52:43,180 --> 01:53:06,789
It's done. Ruby saw your face. It doesn't matter. Don't clap for that. Okay. So IT guy.

518
01:53:07,590 --> 01:53:47,460
IT guy is dead, right? Ruby can get up. That's fine. Compromised. No, that ain't going to work.

519
01:53:47,460 --> 01:54:03,670
Okay. I'm not going to be like, I can't leave my panic room. I have to get somebody to come in here.

520
01:54:03,670 --> 01:54:09,880
Okay. I got coins. Who's around that I can get to come in here?

521
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:29,220
I need like a security guard, another outfit, something. Here we go. Right there. Get in here.

522
01:54:29,220 --> 01:54:41,260
Get in here. Come on into the wall. Are you serious? They're bringing the body up. They're

523
01:54:41,260 --> 01:54:46,140
bringing the body up. They're taking the body out. They're taking the guy out. Not good. Very bad.

524
01:54:46,699 --> 01:55:02,119
We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. I need that body. I need that body.

525
01:55:34,779 --> 01:55:53,369
No. Hold on. Oh, I need this. I need. Look at this. I can't play. I need this body.

526
01:55:54,010 --> 01:56:08,649
Oh my god. They take the body up. No, this is bad. All right. I know what to do.

527
01:56:08,649 --> 01:56:30,949
Did we see it? Who saw it? Okay. I have to sneak. She's going to see me every time. This is horrible.

528
01:56:30,949 --> 01:56:44,460
I've soft locked myself. Why do I need the body? Because I need his outfit. Who's around here?

529
01:56:45,180 --> 01:56:51,859
You're right there. You're back there. Is there? I got to get to the bathroom. All right. I'm

530
01:56:51,859 --> 01:57:00,970
sneaking to the bathroom. Nobody is going to see. There it is. No, Ruby. No. He's got the body right

531
01:57:00,970 --> 01:57:07,460
there. All right. I need to. I need a coin right here or an apricot. Doesn't matter what it is.

532
01:57:08,020 --> 01:57:28,970
You got to be fucking kidding me. They frisk you. They frisk you. How do I throw everything away?

533
01:57:28,970 --> 01:57:31,770
What's the what's the drop button? How do you drop? How do you drop? How do you drop? How do I drop?

534
01:57:31,770 --> 01:57:44,920
G? How do I drop? F? How do you drop something? What the fucked up shit do I have in here? Illegal.

535
01:57:52,069 --> 01:58:00,199
Okay. I'm good. If you want to come through this way, I'm going to have to do it.

536
01:58:04,979 --> 01:58:14,250
I got to pat you down. Sorry about that. Okay. You're all fine. Off you go. How are you today,

537
01:58:14,250 --> 01:59:26,550
sir? I'm doing well. Thank you. What? What are you talking about? Okay. I think I did it. No,

538
01:59:26,550 --> 01:59:40,789
they're going to see me do this. All right. Save. Throw apple. Okay. Throw apple through doors. I

539
01:59:40,789 --> 01:59:47,000
could you know what I could do. I got three apples. Check it out. Let's see if I can get this done.

540
01:59:51,319 --> 02:00:12,600
Distracted him. He's in the sky. Throw the apple up. I wonder if I can do this without anybody

541
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:29,659
caring. Wait, what? Oh, it's right here. As long as I don't do anything. I mean, that is weird to

542
02:00:29,659 --> 02:00:35,189
take somebody's clothes out of a body bag. That is that's weird. But how weird is it? Is it weird

543
02:00:35,189 --> 02:00:45,640
enough for me to get seen? Yes, it is apparently. What the fuck am I going to do about this?

544
02:00:52,569 --> 02:01:40,500
I'm going to have to throw a coin down the hall somehow. What's going on in here? Unlock. No,

545
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:59,180
they're going to take that body out if I'm not. I got to let's see. You go. No, go look for it.

546
02:01:59,180 --> 02:02:34,060
You got a problem, sir? You move around like somebody just kicked your ass real bad.

547
02:02:35,020 --> 02:03:09,819
You motherfucker. This is fucking way louder. What do you think that noise was? Go have a look.

548
02:03:09,819 --> 02:04:09,479
You go look too. Both of you. I got the key, right? I did. Let's go. No illegal items, right? Sir,

549
02:04:09,479 --> 02:04:15,939
if you want to come through, I'm going to have to pat you down. That's fine. Okay. Thank you, sir.

550
02:04:17,220 --> 02:04:22,920
This will be over in no time. Who says apples don't come in handy? That's right. That is exactly

551
02:04:22,920 --> 02:04:27,640
what I said. Good job, sir. Thank you. That was verbatim what I said. Always carry a few apples

552
02:04:27,640 --> 02:04:33,609
with you. You never know when you're going to need to throw it against a wall. Don't get on the camera

553
02:04:33,609 --> 02:04:55,800
or whatever. Okay. Up. We got to go up one more. I'm supposed to be here. I'm supposed to be here.

554
02:05:02,789 --> 02:05:19,529
Save it. It's time. All right. I heard you had a problem with your computer.

555
02:05:22,819 --> 02:05:30,939
Good problem solving skills. I'm known to be the best. Let's take a look. All right. I'm going to

556
02:05:30,939 --> 02:05:52,140
put like rat poison coke on her computer. Make the most of it. All right. I'm in. I'm in. Move

557
02:05:52,140 --> 02:05:59,539
meeting. All right. I moved scanning through director's daily calendar. It became clear that

558
02:05:59,539 --> 02:06:04,500
she has a meeting planned with Fabian Mann and Mateo Perez. It's scheduled around end of business,

559
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:29,529
but should be possible to advance it if needed. Okay. What's this? Newspaper? Is the meeting going

560
02:06:29,529 --> 02:07:00,199
to be in here? Sabotage the clock. Yeah. Not playing anything. Commemorative token. Oh, nice.

561
02:07:00,760 --> 02:07:11,770
What else is in here? She's right in there too. All right. Wait. Oh, wait a minute. There's poison.

562
02:07:11,770 --> 02:07:51,770
Poison. Poisonable shit in here. Okay. Now? When's that meeting? I'm going to go in here.

563
02:07:51,770 --> 02:08:05,539
Private chambers discovered. It's a hostile area. Okay. I'm not supposed to be in here.

564
02:08:05,539 --> 02:08:13,399
All right. Wait. I got to wait for that meeting to happen. I got to tamper with the clock too.

565
02:08:14,119 --> 02:08:19,960
How do I get you guys out of here? Come on. There's got to be something I can throw.

566
02:08:20,520 --> 02:08:24,149
There we go. Perfect. Just like throw it over here.

567
02:08:35,050 --> 02:08:42,220
And then you come investigate an apple. Go see what that was.

568
02:08:54,409 --> 02:09:14,869
Got it. Always carry around a few apples. All right. So now I got to fix the computer. I got

569
02:09:14,869 --> 02:09:21,380
to fix the internet and then they're going to have a meeting and someone's going to fall out the window.

570
02:09:30,310 --> 02:09:52,300
I don't know how to fix the router apparently. I don't know how to fix a router. I'm not a real

571
02:09:52,300 --> 02:10:13,779
IT guy. What the fuck am I supposed to do? Can I even do this? Wait, hold on. Looks like she's

572
02:10:13,779 --> 02:10:31,850
coming out. Shoot it. No, that'll alert everybody. What else do I got here? Okay. I advanced the

573
02:10:31,850 --> 02:10:41,510
meeting. Is there anything else I can do to advance this? Because I can't, the internet is not fixable

574
02:10:41,510 --> 02:10:51,579
now. It was here a minute ago. There she is. Okay. Investigating distraction. What do you mean?

575
02:10:51,579 --> 02:11:25,850
What distraction? Oh fucking God. What distraction? Where is she going? Oh God, no. Go to the meeting.

576
02:11:30,380 --> 02:11:50,220
Meeting.

577
02:12:14,010 --> 02:12:29,000
You're on your own. Run. If your bodyguard or security guard ever says you're on your own, run.

578
02:12:30,439 --> 02:12:48,180
Okay. Go to the meeting. How do I get them to go to the meeting?

579
02:12:57,449 --> 02:13:03,479
There aren't anything else I have to do. I have the gramophone. There's no meaning because I killed

580
02:13:03,479 --> 02:13:24,180
him. Oh, I killed the person that she's talking about. How did I do that? Wait. That's me.

581
02:13:24,500 --> 02:13:30,819
Now listen to me, Ken. Yeah. I don't want to hear any excuses or answer any questions.

582
02:13:31,539 --> 02:13:41,109
Just fix my computer and get out. All right. I already did. Everything's good to go.

583
02:13:41,829 --> 02:14:43,560
I'm going to body block her so she can't leave. Ben, come here. Get up. You did it.

584
02:14:46,380 --> 02:14:52,569
I'm going to take you. Somebody fucking help me. I got the other key card.

585
02:14:59,560 --> 02:15:03,979
My computer sucks. So she has one. Who has the other one?

586
02:15:03,979 --> 02:15:22,789
How are these idiots ever going to find anything?

587
02:15:22,789 --> 02:15:29,130
You know what? I think it's time. It's time just to make this happen.

588
02:15:52,020 --> 02:16:12,199
Director Savalas eliminated. Good work, 47. Second backup data disk is secured.

589
02:16:12,199 --> 02:16:46,100
Just one to go, 47. What is this? Credit card? Oh, wow. I disabled surveillance systems.

590
02:16:46,100 --> 02:17:13,930
Can they hear me through the glass? Is it going to break? What was that?

591
02:17:14,649 --> 02:17:38,950
What was that explosion? I'm firing through the glass somehow.

592
02:17:49,180 --> 02:18:03,399
I need to get the last data disk, but I have no idea where that is.

593
02:18:03,399 --> 02:18:16,870
The mirror is shooting at you. Okay. Can I store this? I can. Can I take this? I can.

594
02:18:18,069 --> 02:18:27,139
All right. I'm ready. I need one more data disk. It's out here. Wait, I have to get rid of you.

595
02:18:31,579 --> 02:18:52,870
This guy's as the agent. Oh, yeah. High security guard. Good to go. Last.

596
02:18:53,430 --> 02:19:01,610
I think I can see right through me. All right. Let's get out of here.

597
02:19:04,950 --> 02:19:16,739
Straight out this way. The IT guy was way more secure than this. Everybody can see through this.

598
02:19:17,620 --> 02:19:35,100
Go fix the router. That's unfixable. I broke it. All right. Down. We have to go into the bank vault.

599
02:19:35,100 --> 02:19:43,739
Oh, my God. Everybody can see through this. Except for you. Shit. This is a horrible disguise.

600
02:19:44,379 --> 02:20:07,899
Okay. Down one more level. I'm going to go get all my weapons. They should still be over here.

601
02:20:08,700 --> 02:20:32,940
Save it. Down one more time. So I should be a high security officer. I'm the bodyguard

602
02:20:34,979 --> 02:20:43,290
of the objective of the game. Don't get restless. Nothing to report. Yeah, me neither.

603
02:20:46,379 --> 02:20:55,379
These are perfectly good apples. How could you let these go to waste? I can unlock this.

604
02:20:58,969 --> 02:21:04,459
I think I have the key card. Yep. I don't even need it. Let's just go into the vault.

605
02:21:15,209 --> 02:21:30,649
Break open. Security lock enabled. All right. I got to go find the security room.

606
02:21:31,940 --> 02:21:39,899
I thought the doors were closed. Area discovered. Wait a minute. Hold on.

607
02:21:43,219 --> 02:21:51,100
Poison. I can put poison into the vents? Car battery?

608
02:22:26,360 --> 02:22:38,329
I'm trying to shock him. I don't like that. I'm going to get less points for that.

609
02:22:38,889 --> 02:22:52,020
I have to live with it though. I have no save. Yes, I do. I'm not losing points.

610
02:22:55,030 --> 02:23:03,860
You already killed four non-targets. So? I'm an assassin. Sometimes you have to do dirty work

611
02:23:03,860 --> 02:23:10,250
with the bad guys. Turn on the air conditioner. Okay. What about this? Unlock the cabinet.

612
02:23:11,049 --> 02:23:19,780
What is in here? A chloroform? Okay. I'm allowed in here.

613
02:23:35,350 --> 02:23:57,110
Okay. Where's the device? Where is it? It's not in here? You're doing easy mode.

614
02:23:57,110 --> 02:24:12,729
The more people you kill, the more frames drop.

615
02:24:17,319 --> 02:24:26,500
So what do I need in here? I got to poison this, but they're going to kill them anyways.

616
02:24:27,139 --> 02:24:48,620
Let's turn this on. So this guy comes out here. And then what? This guy's pissed off. We choke

617
02:24:48,620 --> 02:24:54,819
him out. I take his outfit because he's... I'm already wearing this disguise. Well,

618
02:24:54,819 --> 02:25:26,790
that didn't do anything. Okay. What do you mean distraction? They all just want to turn the AC

619
02:25:26,790 --> 02:25:47,180
off? That's so stupid. I got the key card. They all come out to try to turn the AC off. What about

620
02:25:47,180 --> 02:26:23,799
you? Yup. I taught him here. Oh my God. I had to let him have a victory here. I got what I needed.

621
02:26:23,799 --> 02:26:44,139
There's nobody else even down here. Wait, there's another AC person? Oh no, not good. Did he get it

622
02:26:44,139 --> 02:27:24,969
off? He got his radio. I don't think that mattered. Missing key card. I picked up like four of them.

623
02:27:24,969 --> 02:27:42,379
None of those were it. Oh shit. Really? All right. Well, it looks like I'm going over here.

624
02:27:42,379 --> 02:27:55,450
I wonder if I should go up. Where does this lead out? I need a key card to get in there.

625
02:27:56,010 --> 02:28:26,069
Apparently when I don't have. Are we dropping frames? Oh, that sucks. I wonder why this is

626
02:28:26,069 --> 02:28:35,659
happening. It's been pretty good for a while, but it doesn't matter. Cox always sucks. Well,

627
02:28:35,659 --> 02:28:46,020
I have rat poison though. He's just figuring this out now. God damn it. Really? All right. I don't

628
02:28:46,020 --> 02:28:59,530
want to mess this up. Did I drop one of the other cards? Come on, stop dropping frames. What the

629
02:28:59,530 --> 02:29:14,700
fuck? What's your deal, Cox? What's your deal? Sorry, I don't. Do I have to open it with something

630
02:29:14,700 --> 02:29:39,719
else? There's got to be something in this room, right? Got it. Bingo. Let's go. Vault security

631
02:29:39,719 --> 02:29:53,479
system has been unlocked. Let's do it. And then I beat the level. Should I push the big red button?

632
02:29:54,040 --> 02:30:13,340
That's a deal. What's in the vault? Trespassing. What do you mean trespassing?

633
02:30:17,620 --> 02:30:21,690
Uh, I'm going to save it here. That's not good.

634
02:31:01,659 --> 02:31:15,260
Let's go. What's with the frames? Give me more frames. What the hell? This is horseshit. Oh,

635
02:31:15,260 --> 02:31:22,309
I'm so glad this is going to be over real soon. I'm going to be on fiber in less than two or three

636
02:31:22,309 --> 02:31:41,340
months. It's going to be fantastic. I got it. The expose. A lot of things to do, apparently.

637
02:31:41,340 --> 02:31:54,649
Did he say fiber? No fiber, like fiber optic internet. Fiber to the house. So it's not going

638
02:31:54,649 --> 02:32:12,170
to be through cable internet, which sucks ass. Oh, am I dead? Stream it. Stream dead. All right.

639
02:32:12,170 --> 02:32:42,600
Are we good? Oh, this is bad. This just started right now too. It's struggling. One star though.

640
02:32:42,600 --> 02:32:59,670
How would I get the points? 30,000? Uh, I wonder if I should change. Um, I wonder if I should do

641
02:32:59,670 --> 02:33:11,299
this. This would probably kill the stream though. No, that's not going to work. Let's see if it'll

642
02:33:11,299 --> 02:33:17,620
ride itself out. Damn it. Come on. I was having fun too. I knew this was going to be a short

643
02:33:17,620 --> 02:33:25,670
stream today, but not this short. Uh, I'm going to go take a break. I'm just going to pee. Come

644
02:33:25,670 --> 02:33:36,139
back, see if we can ride it out. I will be right back. Let's see if this actually, uh, stays live.

645
02:33:36,139 --> 02:36:26,229
We'll find out. How are we doing? Have we, has it been bad since I left? It's been bad. Shit.

646
02:36:28,629 --> 02:36:37,000
Even the BRB is getting fucked up. No, I don't want this. I didn't want this to be the last

647
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:40,920
thing I do before TwitchCon. Come on. I wanted to go for at least like three, four, five hours.

648
02:36:41,319 --> 02:37:02,790
Ah, just do a comb stream. I really wanted to get these two DLCs done today though,

649
02:37:03,350 --> 02:37:15,979
but I obviously don't want to stream if it's going to be shitty. Um, yeah, I don't want to stream

650
02:37:15,979 --> 02:37:23,159
this. I did say that I was only going to stream for like three hours or so, three to four today,

651
02:37:23,719 --> 02:37:27,190
because I have to get ready to go and put TwitchCon, but I'm not going to leave yet.

652
02:37:27,190 --> 02:37:33,190
Well, um, we'll just hang out for a little bit. See if I'm going to, I'm hoping now it's still

653
02:37:33,190 --> 02:37:43,239
dropping. Damn it. You might get a random vlog from TwitchCon, just like an hour long stream.

654
02:37:44,040 --> 02:37:48,379
I don't know if I'm going to do that though. So don't hold me to that. I might not have an

655
02:37:48,379 --> 02:37:54,809
opportunity to, cause I'm not going to be there for very long, but, uh, I don't want to continue

656
02:37:54,809 --> 02:38:00,260
to do this if it's going to be unwatchable for people. So those of you that are just going to

657
02:38:00,260 --> 02:38:06,620
take off, uh, I guess you can consider this like the end of the stream. I will see you guys later.

658
02:38:06,620 --> 02:38:11,450
If you're going to TwitchCon, make sure you say hello. I'm going to have a toothpick in my mouth,

659
02:38:12,309 --> 02:38:24,700
find the guy with the toothpick. That's me. But for the next like hour or so,

660
02:38:25,260 --> 02:38:33,500
we're just going to painfully deal with this until I, uh, take off. So you'll see me again.

661
02:38:36,020 --> 02:38:49,379
I'm so salty about this right now. Damn it. It's going to zero and shit. Ah, day before fucking

662
02:38:49,379 --> 02:38:52,899
Twitch. Whatever. It's all right. I can't, I'm not going to sit here and be, uh, pissed off by this.

663
02:38:52,899 --> 02:38:58,569
Uh, I'm going to go like this. At least we got to go through one full hitman mission.

664
02:38:59,129 --> 02:39:05,299
I would like to do both of them. Sometimes you can't do what you want, I guess.

665
02:39:07,770 --> 02:39:14,040
Do talk to transformer. Uh, we'll see. I'll show you guys my, let's just get out of this,

666
02:39:19,620 --> 02:39:27,370
but thanks for watching. Regardless, a nice, a nice quick two hour and 22 minutes stream.

667
02:39:27,370 --> 02:39:32,469
It's like the old days. This reminds me of back when I first started on Twitch,

668
02:39:32,469 --> 02:39:37,690
I would stream for like two to three hours. Remember when I did that? Yeah. Just remember this,

669
02:39:37,690 --> 02:39:52,409
pretend like this dream happened like six years ago. This over here, this should switch over to

670
02:39:52,409 --> 02:40:06,459
here again. We can hang out and do the bits too. Just chill again. If you're going to Twitch con,

671
02:40:06,459 --> 02:40:28,069
please say hello. Hopefully we even stay up long enough to do this. Ouch. All right. Change the

672
02:40:28,069 --> 02:40:45,129
category. Yeah. I've been looking, I'm looking at my stream health on the, on my dashboard.

673
02:40:45,129 --> 02:40:55,139
It's just zero up, zero up, zero up, not healthy stream. Apparently I know Twitch I'm trying.

674
02:40:55,700 --> 02:41:08,729
All right. Let's head over here. Uh, let's turn on. Let's move. I wonder if this is going to work.

675
02:41:12,600 --> 02:41:20,309
Is this still taking it from yesterday? I think this is taking it from yesterday.

676
02:41:20,309 --> 02:41:32,100
Why is it not working? See you later. I didn't take a stream. It was the same, same people. Yeah.

677
02:41:32,739 --> 02:41:39,819
I'll be back on Tuesday, most likely. And I'll probably just end up starting with Hitman 2,

678
02:41:39,819 --> 02:41:45,159
just to try to finish that. And then we'll move on to something else. Unfortunately, I'm sorry.

679
02:41:45,159 --> 02:41:53,670
This is not the way that I wanted this to end. You got to do what you got to do. Uh, I'm going to put

680
02:41:53,670 --> 02:42:05,829
on the wonderful music. I still don't, I don't know why this shit is. I got to figure this out

681
02:42:05,829 --> 02:42:15,639
when I come back, but let's do the bits. Let me put the camera on. We'll just sit here and talk.

682
02:42:19,989 --> 02:42:28,500
Let's do that. How do I, where is it? Oh, it's this one here. Let's see. I'll prove to you guys that

683
02:42:28,500 --> 02:42:42,280
I shaved. If you want to see, is that going to work? Wrong one. This one's cool too though.

684
02:42:42,840 --> 02:43:00,459
Where's my, where's the camera? Oh, there's the camera. It just buttoned on. Oh,

685
02:43:00,459 --> 02:43:14,280
that's what I wanted to do. I shaved, see? Hey, there we go. I got a shaved face. I can actually

686
02:43:14,280 --> 02:43:26,969
make this smaller. All right. Streamlabs OBS. I kind of don't like you at all because it's hard

687
02:43:26,969 --> 02:43:33,399
to move shit around in the scenes. You know what I'm talking about? It's like it locks shit around.

688
02:43:33,399 --> 02:43:40,579
I haven't figured out how to turn it off. It's like, it's like almost harder to use.

689
02:43:48,489 --> 02:43:58,889
All right, there we go. Let's move this over here. So if you're at TwitchCon, say hello. If you're

690
02:43:58,889 --> 02:44:06,010
not at TwitchCon, then whatever, maybe we'll see you on Tuesday. Check the nails too. Did those look

691
02:44:06,010 --> 02:44:18,760
cut to you? Told you. Told you I was going to do it. All right, now I got to go over here.

692
02:44:18,760 --> 02:44:29,879
So I should do this. The music's getting louder, I know. Let's do the bits. It shouldn't take us

693
02:44:29,879 --> 02:44:38,760
very long. We had, I'm not going to yell over it. Zake, thanks for the 250, Zake. You're going to

694
02:44:38,760 --> 02:44:44,969
do a nail painting stream. I don't think, I don't think so. But thank you Zake for the 250. So I

695
02:44:44,969 --> 02:44:49,530
translated the Minecraft copy pasta through every other language in Google Translate and back to

696
02:44:49,530 --> 02:44:56,540
English. And this is what came out. In the game, it's awesome. Yes, there are peas, peanuts, beans,

697
02:44:56,540 --> 02:45:03,610
and various products. We hope you enjoy the place. Black sauce, pour it back. But drinking

698
02:45:03,610 --> 02:45:14,549
apple pie might not be so good. So that is the, that's the intro to the, to Minecraft.

699
02:45:14,549 --> 02:45:28,299
Well, that's, that's good, I guess. Actually sounds pretty fun. Sounds like a fun game.

700
02:45:30,969 --> 02:45:34,969
Drinking apple pie. That, yeah, that's called half the items at Starbucks.

701
02:45:36,469 --> 02:45:40,069
I wouldn't order them if I were you. You come up, I would get, get like an ice coffee. Don't

702
02:45:40,069 --> 02:45:48,180
get anything else. Uh, OC, oh, OcRolo, thanks for the thousand bits. Please use these measly pennies

703
02:45:48,180 --> 02:45:52,889
to buy an eighth of a gigabyte of RAM. You need it. I need it. I'm probably going to get a new

704
02:45:52,889 --> 02:45:58,260
computer. It's been about like three or four years, so I'm probably going to do new PC soon.

705
02:45:59,459 --> 02:46:09,639
Within 12 months. I got, I want to get like a new RTX 2080. Get a new, um, right, 2090. Is

706
02:46:09,639 --> 02:46:17,780
that coming out soon? I know there's one coming out. Should I do AMD? Should I do AMD instead?

707
02:46:17,780 --> 02:46:27,110
Don't need fully new. Yeah, but I have, I have a 6800 or think, uh, CPU. I could do for, I could

708
02:46:27,110 --> 02:46:36,260
do for an upgrade. I want to do like a supercomputer. What's the equivalent of the latest Intel

709
02:46:36,260 --> 02:46:50,299
processors? Are they good? AMD CPU, Nvidia GPU. That's what I was thinking. AMD CPU. I, you know,

710
02:46:50,299 --> 02:46:57,299
I actually heard that AMD really is starting to sincerely give Intel a run for their money.

711
02:46:57,299 --> 02:47:01,219
Just like their processors are just better now. It used to be the complete opposite.

712
02:47:02,329 --> 02:47:08,329
AMD was always like, oh, you have AMD. I've got Intel, Intel inside. And it was always like,

713
02:47:08,329 --> 02:47:12,780
okay, yeah, that's, yeah, that's right. Intel's way better. They're kind of flipping, aren't they?

714
02:47:13,340 --> 02:47:20,600
They're caught. Yeah. They, they, they're way cheaper too. AMD has gotten considered a bit. Yeah,

715
02:47:20,600 --> 02:47:23,399
you know, I probably will. I'll probably do like one of those, what, thread rippers,

716
02:47:24,040 --> 02:47:29,159
just get something crazy and water cool it. But then you can't bring it anywhere. That's the thing.

717
02:47:29,159 --> 02:47:34,520
All right. The thing about having a huge, insane supercomputer PC is yeah, man, this thing's got

718
02:47:34,520 --> 02:47:40,840
like liquified, hydrogenized oil that's cooled to negative five degrees Celsius. It goes through

719
02:47:40,840 --> 02:47:45,399
all these tubes. The tubes are made out of glass, by the way. So never move this computer.

720
02:47:45,879 --> 02:47:48,680
Don't ever pick it up. Don't even fucking pick it up and put it somewhere else.

721
02:47:48,680 --> 02:47:54,790
When you put that 112 pound machine somewhere, that's a full tower. You ain't moving it ever

722
02:47:54,790 --> 02:48:01,700
again. I would be so scared to, to like bring that computer anywhere to ever move. I would

723
02:48:01,700 --> 02:48:07,530
think I would break everything, everything. All the hydrogenized oil would come out. It'd be

724
02:48:07,530 --> 02:48:13,819
terrifying. Yeah. Even with this one now, it was scary. It's kind of heavy and I feel like I'm

725
02:48:13,819 --> 02:48:19,450
going to drop it. I'm just going to hire somebody to take care of it. It's like having somebody

726
02:48:19,450 --> 02:48:24,409
watch your dog, you know, like, Oh, I'm going away for the week. Somebody watch my dog for me. I'm

727
02:48:24,409 --> 02:48:31,690
going away for the week. Somebody watch my computer, please. And make them and let them out,

728
02:48:31,690 --> 02:48:37,459
let them out a few times and like open up the thing at the bottom. And it like pisses out stream

729
02:48:37,459 --> 02:48:45,770
you building it. I would, I would never build a PC like that. That's so much money that I would

730
02:48:45,770 --> 02:48:51,829
literally just be deleting because I would break something. Having like the GPU have the tubes on

731
02:48:51,829 --> 02:48:58,149
it that you have to take off the GPU fan case, put on the your own heat sink. No, no, no. Somebody

732
02:48:58,149 --> 02:49:07,370
else has to do that for me. I can put memory into a slot and I can put video card into slot.

733
02:49:07,370 --> 02:49:13,799
That's about all I'm comfortable doing. I used to be a PC computer doctor, but I lost a lot of

734
02:49:13,799 --> 02:49:20,200
business. I had like 1.4 stars on Yelp because I did a stream and I did a thing where I was like

735
02:49:20,200 --> 02:49:24,920
showing people how to build and I got a lot of flack for it. So I was at like a 3.8 and then

736
02:49:24,920 --> 02:49:30,329
it went down to 1.4. So I decided I was going to kind of just give it up. I guess it's what I was

737
02:49:30,329 --> 02:49:37,819
doing for a long time. So, and the thing is, most of my customers were old ladies. So I don't know

738
02:49:37,819 --> 02:49:41,899
how it was weird how that happened, but they'd come in and I would give them the computer back.

739
02:49:41,899 --> 02:49:46,709
I would fix it. I'd do everything I needed to. I'd build them a computer and I never, they never,

740
02:49:46,709 --> 02:49:52,520
I never got like a call. I never got like a mean phone call or anything. They seemed pretty happy

741
02:49:52,520 --> 02:50:05,059
about it. But anyways, thank you. Thank you to, that's, that was oh, Acrolo, Acrolo. Mini clips,

742
02:50:05,059 --> 02:50:09,270
thanks with thousand bits. Here's some bits for a new computer. Keep having a good stream.

743
02:50:09,350 --> 02:50:15,770
It was until I started to drop a bunch of frames and it was happening for long enough where I

744
02:50:15,770 --> 02:50:22,549
decided I was just going to call it. So you'll see Hitman again. And right when I start talking

745
02:50:22,549 --> 02:50:29,450
about it, there it goes. It's almost like it can fucking hear me. It can fucking hear me talking.

746
02:50:29,450 --> 02:50:37,450
It can hear me. I said that and then it turned off. What the fuck is happening? Who was listening

747
02:50:37,450 --> 02:50:42,809
to this shit and doing this? Somebody just sitting there with like a dial from zero to 10 and they're

748
02:50:42,809 --> 02:50:49,020
just turning it. We even had a problem with this in like at least three or four weeks either.

749
02:50:49,020 --> 02:50:55,639
It's been like a month or so since it was a real issue kind of like this. Oh well, I'll make a call

750
02:50:55,639 --> 02:51:03,719
see if they can do something about it when I'm gone for TwitchCon. So we'll see. But thank you.

751
02:51:03,719 --> 02:51:09,670
Mini clips for the thousand bits. Appreciate it. Acrolo again gave 500 bits. Wait, never mind.

752
02:51:09,670 --> 02:51:14,360
You'll just spend it on a clown costume. Clown costumes are way more expensive than you think.

753
02:51:14,360 --> 02:51:19,959
It's, it's like 80 to a hundred dollars plus for a nice, maybe even like $200 for a nice clown

754
02:51:19,959 --> 02:51:27,100
costume. We're not talking just like a t-shirt. No, no, we're talking a silk, fully complete

755
02:51:27,100 --> 02:51:33,030
overalls. It's way more expensive. I'll be in one for during the entirety of TwitchCon. That's how

756
02:51:33,030 --> 02:51:40,180
you'll find me. I'll be the clown with the toothpick. But thank you for the 10 bucks. Appreciate it.

757
02:51:40,180 --> 02:51:47,190
We also had sad Vega gave $2.50 a belated birthday to you, Jerma. How's it feel to be 34?

758
02:51:47,190 --> 02:51:52,020
Feels, it doesn't feel that bad actually. It feels okay. It doesn't, I don't, it's all right.

759
02:51:52,020 --> 02:51:58,440
It doesn't bother me. When I turned 31, it bothered me. When I turned 32, it didn't.

760
02:51:58,440 --> 02:52:03,850
So I hope that answers your question. But thank you for the $2.50. Thank you fat

761
02:52:04,409 --> 02:52:11,370
Sanic for the 500 bits. No message. They just say, uh, cheer 500. Thank you, uh, fat Sonic.

762
02:52:11,370 --> 02:52:17,209
I really appreciate it. Also thank you to Gnarly for the $2.50. Is this a stealth game week or

763
02:52:17,209 --> 02:52:26,520
something? First the goose game, now Hitman. Then Jerma tries not to be seen at TwitchCon.

764
02:52:26,520 --> 02:52:33,940
I mean it, it, it is whatever you want to call it. What if I really just tried to just not have

765
02:52:33,940 --> 02:52:39,719
anybody see me? I should tweet out a place that I am and I'm just not there at all. Hey, I gotta

766
02:52:39,719 --> 02:52:43,559
be standing in front of this statue of the guy from Borderlands. And I just, I'm not there.

767
02:52:43,559 --> 02:52:49,579
And I'm just sitting somewhere else within distance, within like visual line of sight

768
02:52:49,579 --> 02:53:02,040
distance of that place and just like counting who comes over. Three, two hours, four. Okay.

769
02:53:02,040 --> 02:53:08,090
I got four fans. I got four people that like me here. And then the next day I know I got four

770
02:53:08,090 --> 02:53:12,620
people. So I'm just like, Hey, uh, the four of you. And people are like, wait, okay, so how did he

771
02:53:12,620 --> 02:53:24,979
know that? Come visit me at the coffee station. I'll be there. It's Saturday morning is when I'm

772
02:53:24,979 --> 02:53:29,860
going to be there the most time. Saturday morning into Saturday early afternoon. That's the window

773
02:53:29,860 --> 02:53:36,420
that I'm going to be at TwitchCon. And then I will probably show up at that party for a little while

774
02:53:36,420 --> 02:53:41,139
because I gotta, you know, be the toothpick guy. And, uh, I try to wink with this eye, but I can't,

775
02:53:41,139 --> 02:53:48,729
I can't, I can't wink with my left eye. It's too hard for me to do. I can only go like this and I

776
02:53:48,729 --> 02:53:52,649
have to turn my whole face upside down when I do it. I can't wink with my other eye. It pulls my

777
02:53:52,649 --> 02:53:58,409
mouth over. It's weird. Uh, it's like there's a fishing line here attached to this eye tight

778
02:53:59,049 --> 02:54:09,059
to here. It's odd, but, uh, thank you. I appreciate that. Thank you. Also to, uh,

779
02:54:09,059 --> 02:54:18,600
Final Fantasy 12 Penelo. FF12 Penelo. I don't know why I just said Final Fantasy. Botox.

780
02:54:20,120 --> 02:54:25,959
Not getting Botox. Once you get Botox, that's what you admit that you're old. That's my opinion. The

781
02:54:25,959 --> 02:54:32,489
second that you get Botox injected somewhere, I am admitting that I am old. Maybe that'll happen

782
02:54:32,489 --> 02:54:39,079
when I'm 45. I don't know. Maybe it'll never happen. Maybe I'll never feel old. Maybe I,

783
02:54:39,079 --> 02:54:43,319
and then you, and then if you do it too much, you end up looking, it looks too much. You know,

784
02:54:43,399 --> 02:54:50,100
it looks like you did it too much. No, not gonna happen. Just try to age. I'm gonna try to age

785
02:54:50,100 --> 02:54:57,719
like a nice red blend. Should be all right. What do you think about the shave job? See you in two

786
02:54:57,719 --> 02:55:05,750
days when it looks real good. But we only got a few more. We got, uh, that was, uh, FF12 Penelo.

787
02:55:05,750 --> 02:55:10,469
They said, I turned your stream on at work, promptly forgot I did. So when I put my headphones back in,

788
02:55:10,469 --> 02:55:16,329
I was like, who the fuck is talking and realized. Anyways, genuinely thanks for what you do for

789
02:55:16,329 --> 02:55:23,049
real. It always cheers me up when I need it. I think I would probably be, I was, and that's weird,

790
02:55:23,049 --> 02:55:28,950
audio to hear too. Playing Hitman and talking about like strangling people and poisoning people.

791
02:55:29,510 --> 02:55:33,479
I don't understand. Like I poisoned him. Why is he getting up? I poisoned that guy.

792
02:55:34,120 --> 02:55:39,639
Oh my God. What the fuck, dude? Why is he waking up? I'm gonna throw an apple in his head. You'd be

793
02:55:39,639 --> 02:55:54,120
like, I need to get like a new computer. Oh my God. Mugga ass. But, uh, if you can let me be on

794
02:55:54,120 --> 02:55:59,399
at work, hopefully you have it in a situation where it's okay. And it's not going to be bad

795
02:55:59,399 --> 02:56:03,879
that if you accidentally unplug your headphones and all of a sudden you, your boss hears me saying

796
02:56:03,879 --> 02:56:07,719
fuck. Uh, they're not going to think you said it and then you're going to get in trouble.

797
02:56:07,719 --> 02:56:11,639
So hopefully you got a situation there where it's okay. You got to like a system. You always have to

798
02:56:11,639 --> 02:56:16,680
have like a good system. Uh, and make, and, and make sure you get your work done too. As I don't

799
02:56:16,680 --> 02:56:20,040
want to just burn all your time there. Cause then they're going to blame me. And what if I get the

800
02:56:20,040 --> 02:56:27,350
call from HR? What if my stream gets banned from your company? That's at least like six or seven

801
02:56:27,350 --> 02:56:44,040
followers that I'm going to lose. I can't, I can't have that six or 7,000. No, but thank you. Uh,

802
02:56:44,040 --> 02:56:53,159
thank you to not, not Hugsy. Uh, they said fix your internet. It's sad because I've fixed,

803
02:56:53,159 --> 02:57:01,209
I've fixed this internet probably 15 to 16 times and it'll all be done soon. It's all going to be

804
02:57:01,209 --> 02:57:09,690
over soon. Fiber to the home. I'm going to be on a direct thousand thousand connection,

805
02:57:10,329 --> 02:57:15,770
true fiber. And then we can fucking forget that any of this shit ever happened.

806
02:57:18,459 --> 02:57:21,579
I'm going to have like the best internet you can possibly purchase.

807
02:57:23,079 --> 02:57:30,680
That is consumer grade internet at least I'm going on the fiber diet. That's right.

808
02:57:32,360 --> 02:57:37,479
I can't wait. I can't wait to boot it up and have it be worse than this, which is that's not

809
02:57:37,479 --> 02:57:42,920
possible. If you got direct fiber to the house, no fucking way. All these issues are because coax

810
02:57:42,920 --> 02:57:53,850
sucks ass. Coax cable sucks total asshole. It is a fiber optic line. So all the dropping the frames,

811
02:57:53,850 --> 02:58:00,010
the packet loss, the fucking dropouts, that's all because the cable companies suck and they have

812
02:58:00,010 --> 02:58:05,899
laid this fucking groundwork that's been there for like 40 years and they're all dog shit.

813
02:58:05,899 --> 02:58:11,899
All these lines of trash. So now that fiber is being laid out and they have to have it now,

814
02:58:12,700 --> 02:58:16,860
you have, you, you'll be on a, if you can get on an actual to the home fiber,

815
02:58:17,739 --> 02:58:22,700
all these issues disappear. They don't exist anymore. There's no noise. There's no like

816
02:58:22,700 --> 02:58:27,979
ingress noise and packet problems when you're dealing with a fiber, a true fiber to the home.

817
02:58:28,700 --> 02:58:35,340
You can have internet problems, but not like you do with coax. I fucking hate coax. Coax sucks.

818
02:58:35,340 --> 02:58:39,670
I don't even want it plugged into the back of my fucking TV anymore. I'm going saddle.

819
02:58:39,670 --> 02:58:54,250
Oops. Oops. Looks like somebody may have cut the bike. By the way, I just realized that there's

820
02:58:54,250 --> 02:58:58,840
stuff going on in the background here. Is that an I? Is that a G? Is that a J? What is that?

821
02:58:58,840 --> 02:59:05,260
It says there's like a monster on the left. I didn't even see that. Coax has less latency.

822
02:59:05,899 --> 02:59:09,020
I would rather have stability than care about a few milliseconds of latency.

823
02:59:09,739 --> 02:59:15,020
Coax has so many fucking problems. It doesn't matter where I am. I've, I've used three or four

824
02:59:15,020 --> 02:59:22,120
different coax lines and they would just dog shit. So we'll see. Maybe I'll have my, maybe

825
02:59:22,120 --> 02:59:27,399
fiber is worse, but there's no way it is. I've been told by every person that works in like

826
02:59:27,399 --> 02:59:31,879
internet infrastructure that if you can get on fiber, get on it because it's a thousand times

827
02:59:31,879 --> 02:59:37,879
more stable and better and more consistent than coax. So I'm like, thanks. I appreciate that.

828
02:59:38,600 --> 02:59:46,299
And I'm going to be on it in a couple of months, but I think it's time to see if I set this up

829
02:59:46,299 --> 02:59:52,700
correctly. If fiber is worse, what are you going to do? Um, shit my pants because at that point,

830
02:59:52,700 --> 02:59:56,459
what the fuck am I going to do? I'm going to make my own. I'm going to have to like make my own

831
02:59:56,459 --> 03:00:04,250
internet. Uh, let's see if this works. I want to see, can it work? I just need to know. Never

832
03:00:04,250 --> 03:00:13,579
mind. It's not going to work. Oh, he blew it. He really blew it. I think. Yeah, he did. It's all

833
03:00:13,579 --> 03:00:23,459
right. I didn't, I didn't set up correctly, but thank you to Mark Alter, Mark Alter. Thanks for

834
03:00:23,459 --> 03:00:29,379
the $3. Enjoyed the stream. Good luck with the internet. And I, oh, I hit you in the eye. Now

835
03:00:29,379 --> 03:00:33,860
you can't see. Sorry. Yeah. I'm going to, I'll make a few calls and see what's going on. Hopefully

836
03:00:33,860 --> 03:00:37,780
they can get somebody out here and just turn the nozzle. Like apparently they do every time. And

837
03:00:37,780 --> 03:00:41,780
then it's fine for like a month and a half. I don't understand, but, uh, I will see everybody

838
03:00:41,780 --> 03:00:48,469
at TwitchCon, whoever's going. If you go into the show floor, I'll be there on Saturday. If not,

839
03:00:48,469 --> 03:00:52,549
if you go into the party, if you make it there, I'll be there somewhere dancing with a toothpick.

840
03:00:55,620 --> 03:01:01,239
Thank you guys. Here come the credits. Uh, door cube though, two 50 from door cube. I knew you

841
03:01:01,239 --> 03:01:04,760
were going to shave your face in preparation to TwitchCon. That's what I told you guys that last

842
03:01:04,760 --> 03:01:08,840
night, but I didn't realize you were going to get a haircut too, but I guess you needed one since you

843
03:01:08,840 --> 03:01:19,829
played cosplaying as Daniel clamp from gremlins two. Is that the guy, the tie guy? That's the guy

844
03:01:19,829 --> 03:01:30,139
with the tire, right? Oh, I know. Here come the credits by the way. Thank you everybody. Whoever

845
03:01:30,139 --> 03:01:34,940
subbed in this kind of what did less than two hour period. It's still a lot of people leaving those

846
03:01:34,940 --> 03:01:40,819
streams are going to only be a two or three hours long. Hope you enjoyed hitman for how, as long as

847
03:01:40,819 --> 03:01:49,020
we got to play it before I had to stop. When I come back on Tuesday, we will do the second hitman

848
03:01:49,020 --> 03:01:55,079
mission, clean it up, do the DLC, finish it up and move on from there. I thought there was something

849
03:01:55,079 --> 03:01:58,840
wrong, but that's a person's username. I was like something, the spacing is incorrect on that.

850
03:01:58,840 --> 03:02:09,129
This is really slow compared to yesterday. Yeah. Well, well yesterday was also eight hours and that

851
03:02:09,129 --> 03:02:14,739
was also the first time I'd really come back, um, at my desk in about eight or nine days.

852
03:02:15,879 --> 03:02:20,920
This is still a lot of people do not get me wrong there. This is still a shitload of people that

853
03:02:20,920 --> 03:02:30,729
will sub in the two hours. Hey, cut tack. Thanks for the 500 bits stream extension. Oh, I see what

854
03:02:30,729 --> 03:02:36,500
you know. Right. Yeah. Okay. Zake. Thanks for the 250. You are in the Minecraft copy pasta again for

855
03:02:36,500 --> 03:02:42,819
Google translate. This time all languages. He is the creator of the first chapter of creation.

856
03:02:42,819 --> 03:02:57,879
All other games are important games. You can have a cup of tea. I want to be a magician. At least I

857
03:02:57,879 --> 03:03:07,370
got the last part right. Oh, this last one, this is a Siroc. Thank you Siroc for the 250. They say

858
03:03:07,370 --> 03:03:12,340
goat hog champ German Venus. It's them watching the stream with a goat. Are they at the anti-mark

859
03:03:12,340 --> 03:03:26,459
goats still available? Can we confirm? I don't think there's probably a very many left. Let's see.

860
03:03:26,459 --> 03:03:34,389
Got one. You got one. Is it over? It is over. I had to stop because of the internet, but it's okay

861
03:03:34,389 --> 03:03:40,260
though, because I do have a lot of shit that I still need to take care of before leaving stuff

862
03:03:40,260 --> 03:03:45,620
that is not even Twitch con related stuff. That is my real life related that I have not been able

863
03:03:45,620 --> 03:03:51,260
to do because I've not been here for four or five straight days after I got back. So I will see you

864
03:03:51,260 --> 03:03:57,049
guys soon. Take care. So you have to Twitch con. I might turn the stream on at Twitch con. I don't

865
03:03:57,049 --> 03:04:01,370
know why I would though. Maybe like eating spaghetti for like 30 minutes. It's only going to be like a

866
03:04:01,370 --> 03:04:10,700
20 minute stream. If I do at least show this to you guys because it's funny. Take a look at that

867
03:04:10,700 --> 03:04:18,819
link, get your anti-mark goat. If they're still available, which I don't think they are. Thanks

868
03:04:18,819 --> 03:04:26,100
for hanging out everybody. See you real soon. Take care of yourselves and have a great weekend,

869
03:04:26,100 --> 03:04:38,979
regardless if you're going to be a Twitch con or not. See you soon guys. Now there's no audio on

870
03:04:38,979 --> 03:04:47,110
this. I broke something. I broke something. I don't, you know, it's just a lot of technical

871
03:04:47,110 --> 03:04:54,389
things going on today. But before I leave, BorealBeast gave a thousand bits. Hey German,

872
03:04:54,389 --> 03:04:58,069
this is my first time cheering. It's my birthday today and I wanted to give you something back to

873
03:04:58,069 --> 03:05:02,700
one of my absolute favorite people as well. Love you and your content. Thank you so much for always

874
03:05:02,700 --> 03:05:07,659
making me laugh and get me through tough times. I know you hear this a lot, but I really mean it.

875
03:05:07,659 --> 03:05:15,510
Happy fucking birthday. Hope you have a great one. That was BorealBeast. Anytime I hear about the

876
03:05:15,510 --> 03:05:19,590
stream people like and people have a great time here, it makes me, don't, don't worry if you,

877
03:05:19,590 --> 03:05:24,250
you know, I know you hear this a lot kind of scenario. Every time somebody says that,

878
03:05:24,250 --> 03:05:28,819
it doesn't matter how many times I hear it. It makes me happy every single time. Thank you.

879
03:05:28,819 --> 03:05:34,360
And thanks for the thousand bits. And then HeatLegend thanks for 250. While I can't attend

880
03:05:34,360 --> 03:05:38,040
TwitchCon, I hope you have a great time in San Diego. It rained for the first time today in

881
03:05:38,040 --> 03:05:42,100
over a month, so I hope the weather isn't shitty for you when you get here. This would be the first

882
03:05:42,100 --> 03:05:49,479
time I've been to San Diego as well. Well, not as well. You live there, I think, as it sounds.

883
03:05:49,559 --> 03:05:57,450
But yeah, this is the first time being there. I will see you guys later. Take care. Good night.

884
03:05:57,450 --> 03:05:59,739
I gotta go get ready. See you soon.
