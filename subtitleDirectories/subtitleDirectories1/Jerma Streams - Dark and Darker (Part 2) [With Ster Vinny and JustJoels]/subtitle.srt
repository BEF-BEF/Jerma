1
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:34,780
Yeah, a little early. How are you? What's happening? Uh, could you guess what we're doing today?

2
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:41,500
Do I really need to tell you about my new obsession? This is one of the reasons why

3
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:50,420
I was afraid of this game. One of the reasons why I didn't want to play it is because I know

4
00:00:51,060 --> 00:01:02,250
if I actually liked it, then it was going away in like four days. And then it's going to be,

5
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,730
oh, I'm just going to hop on dark and darker. And it's just gone. But who knows how long

6
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:25,459
into maybe like middle of the year or something. It's not coming back, dude. Yes, it is. Yeah. So

7
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:33,780
here's the plan tonight. There are, uh, there are a lot of people that want to play. And last time I

8
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:40,340
played almost completely and totally by myself. I was just alone almost the whole time. So tonight

9
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,989
is a lot of people that are streaming right now that I believe I'm going to be hopping around

10
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:54,680
different groups with. So the one that's set in stone, the one that is set in stone

11
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:05,129
is stir and Vinny at six o'clock. Now, now hold on a minute here. I'm very aware of the Metroid news.

12
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:12,169
So I told Vinny, I was like, Hey, I know you, I know you want to play that shit. So don't worry

13
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:17,479
about like, Oh, I said I was going to play. No, no, it's all good. So we're going to be kind of

14
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:22,360
cycling people in and out. And there's some other streamers that have wanted to play it.

15
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,979
I don't know how long stir wants to play for, but that's the plan.

16
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:38,229
Did you end up giving that guy's items back? No, I didn't. I don't think I could. The only thing

17
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:42,150
that makes me not feel bad about that is the fact that everything's getting wiped in like four days.

18
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:50,219
Right. Like this, it's, it's, it's okay. The guilt plagues him. No, I'm fine. I told you,

19
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:54,219
I put it down in a corner of my inventory because it's going to be a constant reminder

20
00:02:54,939 --> 00:03:09,930
of my SIM, but I'm going to give you a small warning, small warning. This is going to go a

21
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:17,590
long time. This stream is, I'm just going to play it until I don't feel like, until I don't feel like

22
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:24,389
playing it anymore. This stream could go all the way through to like potentially early into the

23
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:31,050
morning hours. I just want to play it. Same kind of ideas before just going to chill out and just

24
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:38,919
go and have fun. Oh, whatever that means. I know I don't think this is going to be a 14 hour stream,

25
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:45,180
but don't be surprised if it's like eight to 10. I'm going to get up. I promise. I've already

26
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:52,060
eaten dinner. I prepared for this day. I I've got a nice green tea, like a nice full hydrating green

27
00:03:52,060 --> 00:04:06,280
tea drink, drank a bunch of water, full dinner, pasta, carved. I'm carved up. Yeah. So me,

28
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:15,000
stir and Vinny in like 30 minutes. And then from there we'll see. There's a lot of other people

29
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,029
that are probably going to be just jumping in and out. I'll warm up a little. I don't want to be a

30
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:31,689
terrible player when, you know, friends want to play. There's three people. The title needs to

31
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:39,060
be dumb, dumber and dumbest. Yeah. I made it the dumb and dumber sequel title. Dumb, dumber and

32
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,639
dumbest. No, I don't want to have it that because everyone will just call me the dumbest one.

33
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:49,850
All right. If it's dumb, dumber and dumbest, I have to be the dumbest one each, no matter who it is.

34
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:55,639
Of all the streamers I'll be playing with, I'll always be dumbest in quotes. And I don't like

35
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:06,490
that. I don't, I'm not into that one. I'm not a fan of that. It could be me, stir and orangutan.

36
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:11,959
And you would probably have the orangutan be smarter than me. Like, oh yeah, the orangutan

37
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:33,269
smarter than you, Jeremy. What'd you say? The orangutan would be the smartest. I'll give you

38
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:39,670
a little bit of insight into a stream that happened. The replace me stream. I wanted to

39
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:45,980
have one of the contestants be an orangutan. Like just kind of walk into the room and like put the

40
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:52,949
headset on and like play Dark Souls kind of good. And it was like, Oh, wow. Okay. Interesting stuff.

41
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:57,110
And it was just sort of going to be a real orangutan that just like was an aquatic,

42
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:04,360
was a contestant. Um, but again, some ideas just don't work and they can't happen.

43
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,850
Cause like, I was like, Oh, wouldn't it, wouldn't it be kind of fun? Cause like, obviously I wanted

44
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:14,170
to be like, okay, like how do you like, I want to make sure it's done correctly. Like, you know,

45
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:19,050
some animals that are in movies and TV shows, I would want to have like a real, a legit setup

46
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:24,410
where it's the trainer and it's a, like an orangutan that was, it knew how to do this

47
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,810
stuff or used to it. And it was like, no, no like animal cruelty, bullshit, right? I wanted to do

48
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,810
it right. And do it like safe and good, even if we had to shoot it separately or something, right?

49
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:38,089
Um, but it's just, it was like too much of a, it was just too much of a hassle. So I was like,

50
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:50,019
nevermind. It's not worth it. But can you imagine just like, Oh, like, okay, like number, uh,

51
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:54,100
number 10, come on in. And it's just like, kind of orangutan just gets up and like sits in the

52
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,420
chair and just like puts the headset on, just like hanging out. Like, Oh, so what do you do?

53
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:03,220
Interesting. We kind of look alike. It's going to be like a whole little bit. And I was like, nah,

54
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:09,180
yeah. The more you look into that stuff, you're just like, eh, it's probably not,

55
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:14,699
eh, nah. It's funny for, it was funny up here for like 20 minutes. And then I just didn't write it

56
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:28,600
down and it was over. Orangutan would have swept the votes. It would have won by a landslide.

57
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:33,370
Can you imagine just like an orangutan just sitting on the stage and it's just like, has

58
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:56,709
like 90% it just has 90% of the votes. What is this? And you sing happy birthday to my kids.

59
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:10,379
They aren't going to be born until I'm 30. But if you say no, they're going to cry. So stupid.

60
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,660
So what you want to like clip me singing happy birthday. So then in, I don't know how many years

61
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:25,430
that is from where you are now, but then have that to play. That's actually kind of funny to me

62
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:32,200
that like potentially five, 10, whatever years in the future, or even like 30 years in the future,

63
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:39,240
when they're like, I don't know. Oh, it's like George's fucking 16th birthday. I don't know. Oh,

64
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:45,740
and we got a German to do a happy birthday for you by that. I'm not going to be relevant.

65
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:49,899
I'm sorry to say guys, that's people are going to be like, who, who, who is this?

66
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,500
That would be so weird though. Cause imagine like some of these like people that have been on like

67
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,299
TV or like other like people in, you know, movies or TV shows. Cause a lot of people use Twitch

68
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:06,419
and YouTube as new TV. So 30, 40 years from now, that would be so weird. Imagine if it was just

69
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:13,059
like, Oh, by the way, um, you know, Jeremy, uh, happy, uh, happy 20th birthday. Oh, by the way,

70
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:19,460
Elvis says, has something to say to you like Elvis. What do you mean Elvis? And it's Elvis.

71
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:24,500
She's like, Oh, Hey, Jeremy, how you doing? Happy birthday. Uh, singing a happy birthday song for

72
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:30,139
you. Be like, what the fuck is going on? No, I'm not comparing myself to Elvis. I'm just saying

73
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:39,019
like, it's, it's that same world of, this is weird. No, no, no. I, I'm not comparing myself to

74
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:53,899
Elvis. What an ego. No, I get what you mean. Don't worry. Thank you. One chatter. I appreciate it.

75
00:09:53,899 --> 00:10:09,509
Thanks one guy. I think you're going to die on the toilet. That's fine. That, that just doesn't

76
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:15,639
bother me. That's not a big deal to me. That's actually like, I don't know, to me, that's like

77
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:33,639
not really that bad of a place to go. Right? Like that's whatever. Do an Elvis impression.

78
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:37,080
Again, that was wicked funny. No, that see what you're doing is doing the reverse psychology

79
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,440
thing where you thought it was a really bad impression and you were like cringing and

80
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,240
laughing at it. And you, you want me to like, do it again because you thought it was an embarrassment

81
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:51,240
and you think it's funny that I embarrassed myself in front of 400,000, 500,000 people here. Um,

82
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,240
and now you want me to do it again, to do that again. I understand what you're doing.

83
00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:13,139
All right, let's go. Remember there's only 9,000 people here. What the fuck? No, there's 500.

84
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:29,960
You guys are not taking into account the amount of insects that watch this stream.

85
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:36,820
I mean, I got a very large demographic of ants and spiders and each colony of ants, you know,

86
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,379
there's, there's like, there's like, there's like 200,000 ants in a colony. They're big fans

87
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:49,720
because you're not, you're not, you're only thinking of like the human, um, the human audience,

88
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:59,799
which is, I mean, come on. You're also forgetting about all the food that watches all the, all the,

89
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:04,299
you know, your dogs and cats that are in the room. Like I have, I think I have a pretty

90
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:10,570
unbelievably large sandwich audience and I think that there are probably, I probably have like one

91
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:19,690
of the, I probably have a pretty large ham sandwich demographic, probably like ice cream. It's probably

92
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,850
like a, I probably have a very large ice cream audience of like all the ice cream that has been

93
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:30,840
like in front of the, you know, the video while I'm streaming. So yeah, I can say I have a 500,000

94
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,759
concurrent view audience because like you're forgetting the ants, the bugs, the dogs, the cats,

95
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:41,480
the ice cream, the sandwiches, the soups. It's a lot of things and people to watch. All right,

96
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:47,370
you guys ready? Stop stalling. I am stalling because I'm just, hey, I'm just warming up.

97
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:53,429
I actually did not see the direct. I heard there was some interesting things in it though.

98
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:22,919
Pikmin 4, we should watch it. No, I'll watch it later. Your jokes are minus two old man.

99
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:35,669
Hey, hey, who asked? Oh shit. Your name is who asked. God damn it. God damn it. Okay.

100
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:50,820
You can take the, you can take the, the win on that one. That's fine. All right. Um, I'm ready.

101
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:56,139
I'm ready to play. I was going to do a round or two. Maybe I'll probably get one round in before

102
00:13:56,139 --> 00:14:00,840
Dura's around and Vinny's around. We're playing it by ear tonight because I'm going to be live

103
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:19,690
pretty much all night. Okay. Uh, let's go. Y'all know mead one. Uh, I have a confession. I, Holly

104
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:36,279
and I were playing, so I have a few new things. Look at this shit. Holly and I killed a group of

105
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:47,539
three and one of them had this stuff. And I almost have enough to buy a purple. I also have something

106
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:56,629
else to say too. Playing this game with another person is 100 times easier. Holly and I played

107
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:05,980
10 games and we got out, I think seven or eight times. It's so much more of like a ridiculous

108
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:18,309
experience alone. I think I made it out five times in eight hours two nights ago. It's just,

109
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,470
the stress levels are so much lower when there's another person or another two people.

110
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:31,370
But here's the stuff I got so we can go over it. Lots more money. I do want to do the high roller

111
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:37,509
stuff today. Very concerned about it, but I want to try it. Got this candy. Take a look at this.

112
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:48,649
I had that already, didn't I? I forgot to give this to Holly. No, whatever. Uh, I got this here.

113
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:52,950
This is pretty cool. I don't want to, I'm going to warm up a little bit. This is all my gear. Um,

114
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:58,820
I don't, there's nothing down here. Uh, this is just extra space. That's not, it's just,

115
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:06,330
I don't even have to look at it. It's, it's extra stuff. Um, we don't have to see it. Yeah. I,

116
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:12,980
I think I have enough money to be able to, uh, do some of that stuff. Try high roller with a group

117
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:22,389
that knows what they're doing. Can we, can we look at it? I, it's nothing, it is not,

118
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:31,159
we saw it. Okay. Um, I'm just going to go. Let's go. Wait, I don't want to, I don't want to bring

119
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:35,799
anything. I just want to like try to just get through. They did a, they actually changed the

120
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:40,980
goblin caves. For those of you that don't know, goblin caves got a pretty big nerf in regards to

121
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:47,159
how hard it's been. Um, I believe that goblin HP and goblin attack power, pretty much the whole

122
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:53,960
thing was nerfed by like 10% across the board. They added another portal. So it used to be,

123
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,559
I think, what two or three and I think it's two now it's three. So now it's like, I don't,

124
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:04,440
I don't think it's, I think it's actually probably a little better. So they made it not as hard and

125
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:15,160
they added a portal. He's reading patch notes. Yeah. I like this game. They had to make it easier

126
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:21,259
because they felt bad for you. I think you're underestimating. No, I think you're overestimating

127
00:17:21,259 --> 00:17:30,890
how much power I have playing this game. I don't, that's not accurate, but I'm going to hop in it.

128
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:53,019
I mean, I'm just going to go with no gear. Just go by the way, if you didn't know, stop that.

129
00:17:53,019 --> 00:18:09,130
That was awful. Probably get one in before we get stirring here. I thought you're going to play

130
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:15,400
with Vinnie. Yeah. I'm like 15 minutes. We set six o'clock and I don't want to, you know,

131
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:27,220
I want to be like, okay, yeah, it's six. You guys ready? Why is it so loud? Why is it so loud?

132
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:54,630
It's still kind of loud. Is that better? That's better, right? A little too quiet. I'll do this

133
00:18:54,630 --> 00:19:08,440
now. Oh, I, you know, this one doesn't count. What's my, why's my name so weird? What? Fighter

134
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:14,890
two? Oh, what is that? Oh, I have streamer mode turned on. I actually would prefer streamer mode

135
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:37,779
off. All right, let's try it again. That was, the game was really loud. I had to fix it. Good job,

136
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:59,420
streamer. My job to defend auto in every pregame. Sure you want to do high roller? I want to do high

137
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:05,579
roller with a group of three and a group of three that kind of plays and knows what they're doing.

138
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:13,380
It's a hundred bucks every time. All right, let's go. First real game of the night. By the way,

139
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,460
I'm going to be obsessed and I'll be, I'm going to be here pretty much all night. So those of you

140
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:29,990
that are like, oh, it's like 2 a.m. Jerma, it's, oh, I'm staying. We'll see. What? I was holding

141
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:34,970
right click. What happened? No, that's not right. That was weird. I was holding right click and it

142
00:20:34,970 --> 00:21:05,180
didn't do anything. I swear to God, I held it because it didn't do it. Nice. All right, just

143
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:21,000
gotta, you gotta, I just gotta get in the swing of things. I already got that. Jerma, you've been

144
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:44,980
playing this game nonstop for two days. Please bathe. Oh, hey, dude, please bathe. I'm fine.

145
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:55,859
Oh, fuck off. Oh, also, by the way, hey, look what I'm doing. I am running with everything holstered

146
00:21:57,369 --> 00:22:27,539
that you still caught up to me. Oh, God damn it. I'm, I'm dead. God damn it. Just leave me alone.

147
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:35,500
He's going to, it's not going to count like that. It's running into that guy. Okay. All right. I'm

148
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,789
fine. I'm fine. This one doesn't count. This is why you warm up. This is why I'm warming up. This is

149
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:47,140
warm-up shit. He opened the door and like the boss skeleton is there and he just follows me and kills

150
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:52,009
me. That's why I warm up. It's just, you know, just kill me. Kill me. Just do it. Just do it again.

151
00:22:52,009 --> 00:23:01,529
I'm warming up. So you gotta do three warm-ups and that's it. I'm done. We're good. That was a shitty

152
00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:20,170
start too. I hit right click. I didn't raise the shield. You gotta get over these first. There's

153
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:25,109
no such thing as a warm-up in this game. Well, there's enough for me to sit here and like kind

154
00:23:25,109 --> 00:23:30,220
of every, you go through, everybody goes through that process. I don't care if you've played, you

155
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:43,140
know, Dark and Darker, League of Legends, Valorant, Apex, Overwatch. Your first two or three games

156
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:47,619
are usually just dog shit. And then you like, there you go. Then you're in. You're warmed up.

157
00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:57,799
So check out how this one goes compared to the last two. Pretty bad spawn. This is a really bad

158
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:34,180
spawn. I kind of just get out of here. Yeah, I'm just getting out of here. Such a bad place to

159
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:42,920
fight this. All right. Something weird's happening. Sometimes. Okay. Did you just hear me click? It

160
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:48,599
didn't swing. What's going on here? This is actually weird. I swear to God. You had to have

161
00:24:48,599 --> 00:25:07,579
heard the click. What is going on? I hope that's not a problem. What the fuck is going on? Hold on.

162
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:21,980
Yeah, I am like clicking and I am left clicking and right clicking and sometimes it's just not

163
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:31,369
happening. I was gonna, maybe should I restart the game? This wasn't happening yesterday.

164
00:25:45,019 --> 00:26:15,670
Is anybody else having that problem? Or is this just weird right now? I was playing earlier and

165
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:35,259
it was swinging without me clicking. Maybe it's an internet thing. Maybe like the connection of the

166
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:44,710
game or something. As long as half of you believe this, then that's what matters, right? No, I'm like

167
00:26:44,710 --> 00:27:15,509
serious. It actually is happening. It's not happening anymore. It happened a couple times

168
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:46,740
in a row that last game. Now we're in. Now we're in. Don't lose this one. Plus one weapon damage,

169
00:27:46,740 --> 00:28:09,609
movement speed bonus, and it's a blue. This person wants to fight and that's okay. Here's

170
00:28:09,609 --> 00:28:36,329
somebody else. Get over here. Are you two together? Oh, is that how it is? That's how it's gonna be,

171
00:28:36,329 --> 00:29:10,279
ain't it? That's how it is. Oh, okay. I'll take them both on. They were friendly. Hey, that was

172
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:15,900
not friendly. That was very unfriendly. Hey, by the way, I'm not holding right click. See what's

173
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:28,359
happening? All right. Something's weird today. Something's weird today. That was self-defense.

174
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:48,339
Are you friendly? Come here. I'll give this to you. You good? Here, you want something? Spear.

175
00:29:48,339 --> 00:30:06,220
Try that out. There you go. You can't use that? Listen to me. Oh, you're nice. Here, how about

176
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:19,819
you take... Here, do you want a crown? See? Look, I paid for that. Oh my god. Here, have a... Yeah,

177
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:40,329
let me give you... Hey, take this. I just gave you a crown. Did you piss yourself? No. What?

178
00:30:40,329 --> 00:31:28,359
That's cool hanging out. All right, let's go together. That scared the shit out of me. Nice hit.

179
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:39,500
Nice hit. Oh, hey. Hey, look what I got. Look at this. Hey, for being a friend. Come here. Look

180
00:31:39,500 --> 00:32:02,650
at this. Look what I got. No, you take that. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Look, we don't have to argue

181
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:10,740
over who's going to pay the check. I'm telling you I got the check. Take it. My hand touched it first.

182
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:17,349
Yeah. All right. We got to get out of here alive though so you can get... You know, you can get

183
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:44,809
money for that. Yeah, good idea. Just get out of here. There it is. All right. There's our escape.

184
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:48,490
That's for you. No, you got a blue. You got a blue. No, you get out of here with that blue.

185
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:51,450
I'm telling you right now. This is my warm-up round. You get out of here with that blue.

186
00:32:51,450 --> 00:33:10,779
Bro, you got a blue. You got a blue. You get out of here with that blue. There's two. All right.

187
00:33:10,779 --> 00:33:24,410
Let's get out. There's one on top. Oh, there is. All right. All right. There's one up there.

188
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:32,470
Do you know how to get up there? Because I don't and... No, get out of here with that blue.

189
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:42,250
Do you know how to get up there? You do? All right. Take it easy. Good luck. And we're out.

190
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:57,720
Does he know how to get out? Oh, shit. Do you know how to get... He was going, go, go, go. He was

191
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:07,799
like, yeah, yeah. There's one up there. Did you see it? You doomed this guy. Oh, I thought he knew

192
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:14,420
how to get up. Oh, no. No, it's right there. It's right there. You'll be good. You have a potion or

193
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:38,789
anything. Oh, he's going to die. No. You did this. I thought it was like... Because he was like,

194
00:34:38,789 --> 00:34:43,909
yeah, go in that one. I'm like, there's one up there. He saw it. I was like, should I... I was

195
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:51,739
trying to get him to go in. I was trying to get him to go in first. Oh, no. All right. Well,

196
00:34:53,829 --> 00:35:07,510
okay. Oh, that was... Did I even have anything decent to leave? I did. I got the boots. We're

197
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:15,500
good. I got boots. I'm going to start a blue collection over here. I feel so bad. I thought

198
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:22,170
he knew his way out. It should have been me. Yeah, it should have been me. I should have just dropped

199
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:32,139
the boots for him and just died. Let's be real, though. That would have been pretty sick if he

200
00:35:32,139 --> 00:35:51,780
had made that jump. Let me get people on a call here. Here we go. And start. I'm going to give

201
00:35:51,780 --> 00:36:09,719
them a call. Hello. Hello. Hey, there. How are you doing? You've been playing Metroid? It's really

202
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:16,860
good. Is it good? Yeah, it's really good. That's good to hear. Is it like a remake? What is it?

203
00:36:17,659 --> 00:36:22,940
It's like a remaster, like a really, really well done remaster. Have you ever played Metroid Prime?

204
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:33,619
No. Well, I love it. And it's really good. Is it motion controls? You could. I don't. You could

205
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:41,179
just do twin stick. Oh, okay. Yeah. So yeah, I'm enjoying it a lot. How are you, Jerma? I'm doing

206
00:36:41,179 --> 00:36:47,349
great. Good to hear. Good to hear from you again. Yeah, you too. Did you watch the Nintendo Direct

207
00:36:47,349 --> 00:36:54,250
or did you just hear about it like tangentially? I just heard about it. Okay. Is there any other

208
00:36:54,250 --> 00:37:03,000
cool things? Yeah, there's a game where you play like as like a mouse and like you you like draw

209
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,380
other mouses and it's like you're like a wizard. I'm lying. No, Zelda. I was gonna say that sounds

210
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:20,570
like cool. Get him out of here. What? Hey, sir. Hey, am I not invited anymore? Am I? No, you're

211
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:26,659
uninvited. Okay. Okay. Well, then yeah, what are we laughing about? Oh, good one. Yeah, it wasn't

212
00:37:26,659 --> 00:37:31,860
that I tried my best. But you know what? It was the Zelda trailer looks good, Jerma. So you you

213
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:36,579
know, when I play when I finish Breath of the Wild, I'm gonna be able to go right into the new one,

214
00:37:36,579 --> 00:37:45,739
aren't I? Yeah, you're gonna have fun with it. That's pretty cool. I just I had a successful run.

215
00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:52,550
Okay, I haven't installed the game. What's the what are we playing? No, sir. You guys wait for

216
00:37:52,550 --> 00:38:01,690
me. Booking three head. We're playing Darkest Dungeon, right? Oh, I got that. Yeah, it's one

217
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:08,360
of the two dark games that are available for the steam next best dark and darker. I just want to

218
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:13,800
play it. I know they're gonna like take it offline. And they're gonna polish it up more. And

219
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:23,079
I want to play it. Why aren't you playing class? Are you germ? I just did fighter. Okay, I'll go

220
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:27,480
I'll use my wizard then. I have a lot of random classes. But the only one that actually has gear

221
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:36,599
or money is this fighter. Okay. Yeah, I leveled a fighter. I have some stuff on a wizard. But yeah,

222
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:42,550
if you want to invite me, my name is vines art like a wizard, but with Vine,

223
00:38:43,579 --> 00:38:49,289
I couldn't think of a better name. My characters have like, like a little number one next to them.

224
00:38:49,289 --> 00:39:03,030
I didn't even know what to do. Would you say German one? No, mead one. Okay, I'm v i n e z a r d.

225
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:14,179
There you are. All right, sir. What's your what's your name? I haven't made a character. What? What

226
00:39:14,179 --> 00:39:20,070
should I be? You? I didn't you tell me you played this? Yeah, I think they wiped it like it was like

227
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:26,949
four betas ago. Oh, I told you I also told you I have no levels and no gear and no nothing.

228
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:31,110
That's fine. I didn't lie. But you just you know, video games. So you're gonna be you're gonna be

229
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:39,300
fine. I know. I know video games. Alright, so um, I'm a leveled up, Vinny, you have more experience

230
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,940
than I do in this. Do we like I would say we probably need like, we got a wizard, we have a

231
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:49,269
fighter. I mean, you could be I mean, cleric, you're leveled, you're leveled pretty nicely.

232
00:39:49,269 --> 00:39:58,250
I would say I only played a lot last beta. Um, you know what ranger and cleric are two good choices.

233
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:04,739
I would say cleric is good for healing. But Rangers apparently really good with their like,

234
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,980
their arrows do a lot of DPS. So it's up to you, sir, whatever you like. And

235
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:18,860
rogues can rogues still go invisible or whatever they did before? They can. Okay, I think if you

236
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:23,739
played the first very first playtester, there's I think there's actually a lot of new things in

237
00:40:23,739 --> 00:40:33,349
the game. I didn't play very much. I just played a little bit of cleric for like an hour. I have like

238
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:38,619
a couple things you probably could take just to have some stuff. I mean, you're not you're not

239
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:46,920
getting my blues. But you know, depending what you play. Do you need a green rapier? I have a

240
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:53,289
green spear. But I can't even use rapiers. You can. Yeah, fighter. Oh, wait, no, you can't.

241
00:40:53,289 --> 00:41:02,840
Rogue can though. So I give it to you stir. I made a rogue. My name is creepo man. Okay. Wow.

242
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:12,840
Like they like this. I wrote it in discord. Capital C creepo man. I'm not in the lobby.

243
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:17,500
Enter the lobby. I'm entering the lobby. I'm in the lobby. There you are. All right, cool.

244
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:27,960
Sent invite sent. I am meed one. I can't sell this. This dude doesn't want to buy this stuff.

245
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:34,570
Cool. Fine. It's the collector that buys that shit. All right, so stir, I'll get you a weapon

246
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:39,610
from my stash. I feel like you shouldn't give me anything yet. Yeah, let's let's let's just do a

247
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:43,530
fuck face run. That's probably Yeah, take off all your good shit. Yeah, let's do a fucking fucking

248
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:48,090
raw dog my face on this one because I didn't play very much when I played and I only played

249
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:57,659
cleric and I kind of just healed. Why did you say it like that? Huh? I'll tell you what I have a

250
00:41:57,659 --> 00:42:06,409
shitty rapier as well. I'll give you that one. Okay. Yeah, let's just go in without any. I mean,

251
00:42:06,409 --> 00:42:11,460
he's gonna die. He's gonna die to the first skeleton and he's gonna uninstall the game.

252
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:17,619
Well, no, because I'm going to stand on a box. Are you guys right? Yeah, we're good. Do you like

253
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:22,980
do you like you you like played this? You know, how kind of how generally how it works? I think

254
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:27,300
it would honestly be in your best interest to assume that I don't. Okay. I wait. No,

255
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:33,059
I understand the gameplay. Everything outside of it, like equipment and selling. I don't that

256
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:39,269
doesn't make any sense to me. Okay, so but like basic information, like how do I like basic

257
00:42:39,269 --> 00:42:43,699
information? I might have to read buying keys. I'm good, dude. You know, I'm a gamer. You're

258
00:42:43,699 --> 00:42:48,019
gonna be good. You're gonna be good. Let's go. I believe in you, sir. Yeah, just a quick fuck

259
00:42:48,019 --> 00:42:54,659
face run. Yeah, just like a dirty nasty. It doesn't even happen. Stank nasty. I got it.

260
00:42:54,659 --> 00:43:01,260
If anything goes bad, I'll just crouch in a corner. You'll be fine. Okay, just already up though.

261
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:10,739
How? Okay, I got no stirs stirs stirs a gamer. You'll get it. Okay. I'm actually you've been

262
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:17,320
playing this a lot, huh? Like you got as addicted as I did. I I'm one of those people that I'm very

263
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:21,000
much already thinking that this is probably going to be the thing that I care about the most this

264
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:28,780
whole year. Yeah, I feel that I really like this game. Okay, they're there. I got to turn off the

265
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:33,900
voice chat because they're just saying voice isn't voice at the best part of the game.

266
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:42,119
It is until your Twitch channel gets banned. Oh, yeah, it is. When you're okay. Well, I'll get

267
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:48,010
banned. I'll take the L. All right, it can be fun. I got to hear what they're saying. I already did

268
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:53,130
a pre record of with voice chat on I was able to convince people not to kill me. I was like,

269
00:43:53,130 --> 00:44:00,679
listen, dude, I'm a real person. Like I'm real. And they left me alone. I did a little RP. This

270
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:11,159
one here you can have that rapier. It's it's good. You might like it. I'm I'm in the options. Defend

271
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:16,199
me. Okay. All right. It's good because this is a very slow game. So like it's not like, dude,

272
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:21,619
we got to go come on the circles. Okay, the circles closing in. Yeah. In the meantime,

273
00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:29,139
let's go look around. So hey, quick, quick TLDR stir everything. You should be picking up as

274
00:44:29,139 --> 00:44:33,139
many of these little jewels as possible. It's like one of the ways to make money. You want to

275
00:44:33,139 --> 00:44:39,829
collect everything. If it's like a little bracelet, a little jewel, a little goblet,

276
00:44:39,829 --> 00:44:46,380
that's how you actually make money. And then we bring it back and it's a socialist society.

277
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:51,500
And we all share right? No, there's one guy that buys it all and runs the whole town.

278
00:44:51,579 --> 00:45:08,059
What's the inventory tab? They didn't make it high. Do they not? Let me get this. There you go.

279
00:45:08,059 --> 00:45:16,039
Yeah. Spider. Spider. All right. There's another spider. There's a pot over there somewhere.

280
00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:22,500
Oh, my goodness gracious. Okay, we got I got a blue long sword. Watch out mead. I'm going to put

281
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:30,250
that on. Remember, you can throw a torch on the ground if you need extra light and don't want to

282
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:38,920
hold it. Okay. This thing's actually pretty awesome. I hope we make it out. Oh, skeleton.

283
00:45:40,579 --> 00:45:49,030
Watch out. Magic looks awesome in this game. Oh, it seems unbelievable. You're not you're not

284
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:54,539
role playing. You're not like you don't say the spells when you cast them. Oh, should we? I can't

285
00:45:54,539 --> 00:45:58,780
if you want me to. They gain more power the game. If you have voice chat on and you say magic missile,

286
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:06,550
it gets a can you can you is this better than you have stir the helmet on the leather cap? I don't

287
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:12,789
dude is I don't know what items are. Yeah, well, I think okay, Diablo. When you're running around

288
00:46:12,789 --> 00:46:16,389
at level one in Diablo and every single thing you pick up on the ground is like, yeah, just replace

289
00:46:16,389 --> 00:46:21,510
it. It's better. Okay, I heard you should go nude because then you get more move speed. I mean,

290
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:27,110
did you you could I don't know. I don't know if that's gonna work. But speaking of moving speed,

291
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:33,110
if you holster you do move faster. So keep that in mind. What's the most important x guys? Okay,

292
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:38,230
I okay, I need a moment to apologize because I'm going to be insufferable for like one or two games.

293
00:46:38,869 --> 00:46:45,510
Just naked. Why are you just a naked guy in our party? Hey guys, dirty loot in there. I

294
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:50,630
can really use some pants. I am not a conjurer of cheap tricks. I just walked right out of a rust

295
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:59,610
server. You really do like you're like like rust. Oh, we got a skeleton here. I'm gonna die.

296
00:47:02,889 --> 00:47:07,289
There is friendly firester and it's really bad. So just be aware. Okay. Yeah. Well,

297
00:47:07,289 --> 00:47:11,050
you're the one who's taken the most damage. So I feel like you could use a little advice.

298
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:15,130
Stir better rapier here for you on the skeleton's corpse. Oh, yeah. And also,

299
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:21,079
Jeremiah. Yeah, there you go. If you guys want to give me 10 seconds to meditate so I can restore

300
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:27,559
my magic, that would be awesome. Also stir in the mini map. You notice that the white line

301
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:34,300
got to get in that line because you understand what happens. The it's like a br like victory

302
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:39,989
royale is within. I've never played one of those. What happens essentially when the thing with the

303
00:47:40,869 --> 00:47:45,219
goes around the circle and if you're not in the other circle, watch out because you're going to

304
00:47:45,219 --> 00:47:53,260
be taken tick damage. Yes, sir. Have you ever played a game called Fork Knife? So it's like

305
00:47:53,260 --> 00:48:02,380
Hearthstone Battlegrounds. Is it normal that your game should stutter all the time? We haven't know,

306
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:05,420
but we have we have somebody over here. We don't know if they're friendly. It is just looks like

307
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:15,059
a single cleric saying yes. Okay. Hey, sir. Careful on the ground. Sometimes there's like,

308
00:48:15,539 --> 00:48:21,860
uh, like spike traps like over here. Like do not step on this. Okay. And if there's a if then if

309
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:25,860
there's a trap in the wall, you're supposed to walk back and forth in front of it like three

310
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:31,860
or four times. Yeah, exactly. I know you make learn. Okay, I've learned a lot about this game,

311
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:36,260
but mostly only from Jeremiah. Everybody does that. It's not just me. Everybody does that.

312
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:42,019
Watch out. There's a this player down here. We don't know if they're friendly if they who cares.

313
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:46,099
Okay, so we got we have a little group here. Friend or foe, friend or foe. How are they?

314
00:48:46,099 --> 00:48:50,980
Yeah, we're friendly everybody. If you can hear me. I have voice chat on so they can hear me,

315
00:48:50,980 --> 00:49:01,739
but I can't hear them. So I can't get banned. Shit, I got hit by that. Hey, actually say make

316
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:06,579
sure you say like, hey, we're friendly until it counts in the end. We're friendly until it counts

317
00:49:06,579 --> 00:49:13,619
in the end. I've been told to say you don't actually say that. Oh, I'm not going to attack

318
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:17,219
you. I'm not going to attack. Don't know if you're going to have a cleric. It's cool to have cleric.

319
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:24,280
Why did you hit him? No, now they're going to. No, it was an accident. He's new. He's new.

320
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:33,829
We really we don't want to. You're cool. It's fine until it counts in the end. We're not going to

321
00:49:33,829 --> 00:49:43,139
kill you. Hey, can you heal? Can you heal our like goofy ass friend people on the other side

322
00:49:43,139 --> 00:49:51,130
of the store? There's a you disabled input, but not output as a chat member. Is that you?

323
00:49:51,929 --> 00:49:55,449
No, there's someone behind the door. They're throwing fireballs. They're getting real. All

324
00:49:55,449 --> 00:50:02,579
right. Let's let's fuck them up. Oh, I'm just taking damage. That's awesome. Oh, no. Oh,

325
00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:10,570
there's a spike trap right here. Oh, my God. Hey, we're friendly. We're friendly guys. I'm about to

326
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:17,289
I'm kind of about to die. I think. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Oh, the cleric is going to die.

327
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:21,909
I have a campfire here if we if we needed to heal up.

328
00:50:22,309 --> 00:50:28,949
You're killing the person. What are you doing? Oh, my God. No, he's the worst. He's the worst.

329
00:50:29,909 --> 00:50:33,110
We got to get him out of the fucking game. He's already a fucking problem. He's already.

330
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:45,030
He's a massive problem already. He had a lot of shit on him. Okay. Hang on. Hang on. Good.

331
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:56,460
Wow. I went to the trap. He bounced me into the trap. Oops. This is such a bad place to fight to

332
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:05,429
try to like. Yeah, it's a really bad place. Oh, shit. So he's going to me. That one. You got him.

333
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:09,590
Okay. Okay. Cool. I think it's just this one of the guy in there, too, right?

334
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:14,710
I don't know if there's another guy that might have been there is there is one guy. He looks

335
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:19,590
like a wizard. I can't believe I'm looting the person. This is unbelievable. And look,

336
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:27,030
this is a nice bowl of shit. That's my kill. Are you seriously looting him right now? You got naked.

337
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:32,070
I got the kill and you're looting it. I dropped the bow on the ground. It's a blue bow. Yeah,

338
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:37,190
let's do it. All right. Come follow me. I think we're going to get the safety. Did you get the bow?

339
00:51:37,909 --> 00:51:46,739
Yeah, that doesn't seem good. There's a whole other party over here. Oh, shit. Okay. I don't

340
00:51:46,739 --> 00:51:50,099
know if I can. It's going to take a while to full heel and we got the circle closing in.

341
00:51:50,739 --> 00:51:56,179
Yeah, let's get in the circle. All right. We try to get out of here. The portals are opening.

342
00:51:56,179 --> 00:52:03,059
We start to find some skeleton. Okay, a creepo man like come over to us. Well, there's another

343
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:08,260
exit. Why don't we take the other exit and avoid the combat? Good. We got to get into the circle.

344
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:12,980
Yeah, it goes into a circle as well. So come up. Yes, let's get there. We missed a bunch of treasure

345
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:18,820
too, but that's okay. Beware of traps. This is a this is a trial run for stir. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

346
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:24,820
Exactly. I cannot believe that person is probably so pissed because it was like, oh, yeah, we're

347
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:40,059
playing it. Oh, there's people here. You any hits? Uh, not really. Oh, fuck. Big, big cast here.

348
00:52:40,059 --> 00:52:47,610
I think I might be able to. Yeah, they're gonna shoot down the hole. We might be able to ambush

349
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:55,960
here if we pull back. Stir, are you dead? I exit it. What? What? You got out? Yeah. Wait,

350
00:52:57,239 --> 00:53:05,269
where? Where? Where did you go? In the room we were in, there was an exit and he had nothing.

351
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:11,690
Sorry, I took it. Friendly. We're friendly. Oh, my God. There's they're there. They're right

352
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:17,340
behind us. They're behind us. Okay. Okay. Yeah. All right. Close the door. Close the door.

353
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:22,460
Vinny, did you take it? I got nothing. I got nothing. All right. Be well. All right. I'm

354
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:29,739
gonna do my best. I just need to figure this out. Be well. Wait, what? Wait, wait. Your wizard is

355
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:37,420
low HP. You the fighter, valiant, noble fighter, just left the wizard with no HP. Well, here's

356
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:43,500
the thing. So let me explain. Let me explain how this game works. Stir. Okay. I have I found a

357
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:48,710
blue sword, which is like really good for my class. It's I mean, it's like that's a big deal.

358
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:53,909
There's no trading unless you you have to like pay or like bring it and drop it. Hey, can you

359
00:53:53,909 --> 00:53:57,429
hear me? You want to share the campfire? It's gonna be cool. All right. Never mind. I'm dead.

360
00:54:01,159 --> 00:54:09,989
It's so awful. Chad, are you sure that my output? Can you guys hear me in game? Germ? I have voice

361
00:54:09,989 --> 00:54:16,389
chat turned off. I had I was off by default. I'll turn it on and I can. I had an issue

362
00:54:16,389 --> 00:54:21,639
a couple nights ago where I had a kind of, you know, somebody, an incident, somebody said

363
00:54:21,639 --> 00:54:26,969
something and it's like, okay, well, now we fucking have to turn it off. Yeah, that's 100%. So I turned

364
00:54:26,969 --> 00:54:35,670
it off. But yeah, I check. So the game's pretty easy, huh? But here's the thing, stir, what you

365
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:40,570
did was not necessarily wrong because you got a blue bow. But the problem is, so you could like

366
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:47,449
just stash that. The stash is not shared. So it's not like, oh, I'm going to make a ranger and just

367
00:54:47,449 --> 00:54:53,130
go to my shared stash. That's not in the game. So if you want to put that on a ranger, you're going

368
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:57,849
to have to like give that to one of us and we have to get out and then give it to your ranger or

369
00:54:58,489 --> 00:55:01,929
trade it on the market. There's a trading market where you can trade with other people.

370
00:55:01,929 --> 00:55:05,929
But it costs, what, 15 gold to do it. You're giving stir an ethics lesson.

371
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:18,980
Okay, so I got nothing and I can only sell my bow. What should I name this rogue,

372
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:29,019
this archer chat? I don't know. Sneaky archer. That's a pretty good name. God, it's not available.

373
00:55:29,019 --> 00:55:34,599
Skyrim, you want me to call him Skyrim? Okay, I have a game mechanics question, teacher.

374
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:44,630
Why are there 12 merchants? Because you sell different things per merchant.

375
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:54,380
Okay. Yeah. So for instance, the collector, the collector wants to take like gems, jewels, bangles,

376
00:55:55,099 --> 00:56:01,989
chalices. That's who you sell all that to. And I know you, I know, let me, I just want it in one

377
00:56:01,989 --> 00:56:06,949
spot. I just want to hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. Sometimes stir, you got to slow down and enjoy

378
00:56:06,949 --> 00:56:18,309
the lore. Okay. Okay. So the collector, you can sell those little- Who would I sell the bow to?

379
00:56:18,309 --> 00:56:24,920
We're looking at the weaponsmith or the armor. Okay. Selling that bow, I mean, but maybe if you

380
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:31,300
do have a ranger. I'll take it. Yeah. I just made a ranger. Do you want the bow? You can sell it

381
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:38,900
if you want. I mean, honestly, I escaped on my first game. I got a kill and I didn't even have

382
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:45,480
any clothes on, so I don't even think I need the bow. I can give it to you. Yeah, just bring it in

383
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:49,480
the mission, then drop it on the ground. I'll take it. Okay. Because I just made a ranger. I want to,

384
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:55,880
I feel like my wizard, I was just getting no, no attacks on enemies, really. I can't believe you

385
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:03,739
killed that. That person was being so nice to us too. I know everybody's saying, hey, dude,

386
00:57:03,739 --> 00:57:10,519
you should buy the thing for the gold stash, right? But I'm, I'm a weirdo and I want to like

387
00:57:10,519 --> 00:57:17,179
fill half the stash with this because I like the way it looks. That's saying I killed at least two

388
00:57:17,179 --> 00:57:23,690
people. I think, no, I think, I think you, you were part of at least, I mean, the two kills that we got

389
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:30,949
in that hallway. Okay. All right. Yeah. I might go back to wizard then. I'll try ranger for a little

390
00:57:30,949 --> 00:57:37,340
bit, but then I'll go to, I'll go to wizard. How do you level up? Because I'm noticing I'm still

391
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:45,369
level one and I feel like I shouldn't be. You just got to kill more rats and creatures and skeletons

392
00:57:45,369 --> 00:57:51,210
and players. It takes a little bit. I mean, all honestly, all leveling up does is I, I feel like

393
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:57,429
a level 15. Okay. So when you level, look, the game is still making stuff. So if you go to honestly,

394
00:57:57,510 --> 00:58:02,949
you should do this right now. I'm just babbling random words and you took it as they're still

395
00:58:02,949 --> 00:58:10,019
making the game, but hold on, go, go, go up to the top, go to class. You see the, go to perk and skill.

396
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:15,539
Yeah. You have some perks that you, you unlock perk slots essentially is when you, how you

397
00:58:15,539 --> 00:58:21,849
every five levels. Okay. I was just, well, I was asking this how specifically I was just killed

398
00:58:21,849 --> 00:58:25,929
nerds. Yeah. Just kill me, just kill people. You know, you're saying it was a good thing. I killed

399
00:58:25,929 --> 00:58:32,630
that guy now. Now you're flipping again. There might be something in that perk listed. You would

400
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:42,579
rather have is what I'm saying. So look, so is this what it's usually like with you guys? Yeah.

401
00:58:43,659 --> 00:58:57,239
Yeah. Yeah. It's been like this for 10 years, man. 10 years. I'm, I'm, hi, I'm Vinny by the way,

402
00:58:57,239 --> 00:59:02,360
star. Nice to meet you. Yeah. I think I'd like Vinny. I think he's like Vinny. Yeah. Yeah. You seem

403
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:06,730
nice. Thanks man. Appreciate it. No, we were, we were, we were dark tide friends for a while. Come

404
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:15,940
on. Yeah. Yeah. No, me and Jerma, we, we hunt ghosts usually, or we, we hit people with swords.

405
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:22,940
That seems to be like the two extremes of our gameplay. Me and Jerma argue. Okay. Hold on. I

406
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:27,989
have to show this. I have to show this on stream. This is so stupid. Hold on. While you look at your

407
00:59:27,989 --> 00:59:37,340
perks, I just need to show this on stream. This is so stupid. What is it? It's, it's just a dumb

408
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:59,739
picture. Oh, man. That's, that's funny. I like it. Yeah. That's a good one. Didn't take them that

409
00:59:59,739 --> 01:00:08,920
long. Huh? No, not at all. That was a good one though. All right. Are we, are we good to go? Yeah.

410
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:14,679
I think, uh, I'm ready. So we just get a stir. You need to ready up when you're, uh, one second.

411
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:24,179
Okay. Sorry. I'm, I'm comprehending. All right. This is a really good sword. Actually I killed

412
01:00:24,179 --> 01:00:31,820
that guy in two hits. I'm not taking it. I'm going to leave it. I don't have the picture. Jerma had

413
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:38,070
the picture. You want me to capture his stream so I could show you the image? Yeah. He didn't show

414
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:44,840
it to me. So here I have it. It was posted in chat. I'll show you. I feel like it wasn't meant

415
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:54,420
for me. I'm ready. Okay. All right. Will you put clothes on? Oh, wait, you, you got out. So you

416
01:00:54,420 --> 01:01:01,000
don't have any, you throw it off. Okay. Let's just go. I was wondering why, cause like you're naked

417
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:14,860
and that's what that, okay. I get it. I like the lobbies go so fucking fast. I mean, you're there

418
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:19,989
five seconds. Someone punches you in the back of the head and then you just start. It's, it's

419
01:01:19,989 --> 01:01:23,670
good in a play test environment though, because there are like 50,000 people playing this game

420
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:28,570
right now concurrently. I can't believe how big this game blew up. Cause like when I was playing

421
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:33,829
it for December's tests, that was the first time I had even heard of it. And then it just like

422
01:01:33,829 --> 01:01:39,510
quadrupled and then like times 10, the amount of users. Yeah. The first beta was, was kind of a

423
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:44,389
long wait time, but I think, I think everybody kind of was waiting. Like after that December test,

424
01:01:44,469 --> 01:01:47,690
I remember hearing about it and going, Whoa, that looks kind of interesting.

425
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:50,570
And then it was like, wait, it's actually coming for the steam demo thing. Oh,

426
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:57,000
fuck. Yeah. I think everybody had the same idea. Yeah. I was really addicted to this. It was like

427
01:01:57,559 --> 01:02:04,920
four hours. Hey creepo man. Yes. Oh, take orders from your master. What do you need from a creepo?

428
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:09,099
I need you to, you hold, if you hold a torch, it increases the, you know what? Just get in here.

429
01:02:09,099 --> 01:02:13,099
It's easier to creep in the dark. I'm pretty sure creepo man was a stone temple pilot song.

430
01:02:15,579 --> 01:02:23,099
All right, chat. Uh, we get some pants. What was that thing that you posted about some

431
01:02:23,099 --> 01:02:28,150
songs that like people said didn't exist or something. Oh, uh, I was streaming

432
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:33,960
corruptions the other night and I was playing GTA San Andreas and people were all like stretchy.

433
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:38,360
I was like, they look like rubber bands. And in San Andreas, there's a stone temple pilot song.

434
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:43,420
So I was like, that's a, that's a song from back in the day. They had a song called rubber band man.

435
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:49,929
It's like rubber band, rubber band man. Um, and people were like, no, it's not real then.

436
01:02:49,929 --> 01:02:56,389
That's not a real song. And then I found it on an old tape. So when I was a kid, I honestly thought

437
01:02:56,389 --> 01:03:01,449
that was a bit from you. I thought it was you singing. Oh, I was like, oh, this is like really

438
01:03:01,449 --> 01:03:04,889
funny of him. Like he made this like rubber band song. Like, and he's saying it's a stone

439
01:03:04,889 --> 01:03:13,239
temple pilot song. Yeah. But it's a real song. That's funny. Yeah. It's real. Yeah. We are doing

440
01:03:13,239 --> 01:03:19,050
like, by the way, we've lost creepo man. I'm in the darkness. Hey, star, where are you? I'm in the

441
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:25,420
dark. Oh, he's back here. Okay. There's helicopters in this room. I feel like we should catch up with

442
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:31,500
star. Can I make the plants versus zombies VOD permanent? It already is on the archive channel.

443
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:45,289
Come on, Gwen. Oh, all right. You got that bug. That's good. All right. Uh, you see any treasure

444
01:03:45,289 --> 01:03:50,489
in here? Yeah. Open up every chest stir because sometimes it just be something in there. You just

445
01:03:50,489 --> 01:03:54,650
take everything. I feel like it's a waste of time because you guys are already doing it. I feel like

446
01:03:54,650 --> 01:04:00,570
as a team, we should also have different roles. Can you one guy's the looter, one guy's the torch

447
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:08,710
guy? You know what? Um, these pots are also good. There's sometimes really good stuff and potions

448
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:22,019
in them. There's not be down here. Watch out. We got says, um, I love how you've, uh, you stir.

449
01:04:22,019 --> 01:04:28,920
You've committed to being like the comic relief today. Comic. I'm taking this really seriously.

450
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:34,969
I have just like naked running around, like killing our friends, the naked vagrant. You

451
01:04:34,969 --> 01:04:38,969
guys said you were going to kill him when it mattered at the end and it mattered to me.

452
01:04:38,969 --> 01:04:46,519
Shit. We, that's right. That was said out loud. I'm at my fault. I feel like I'm getting,

453
01:04:46,519 --> 01:04:53,559
I'm catching a lot of flack back here. I said I'm, I'm calm to that. Here. I'll be torched guy.

454
01:04:56,010 --> 01:05:01,880
Get them. Do you guys see him? Do you guys see him? Do you see him?

455
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:10,380
All right. You can just punch him. It's kind of dark in here. Oh, we've only had a,

456
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:19,369
I've only had a creep with a light. How do you throw the torch? Uh, right click,

457
01:05:19,369 --> 01:05:23,530
but you only have three of them. So should we go this way or should we? I feel like we might get

458
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:26,969
stuck down here. Uh, there's a helicopter down here. I'll let, I'll let you lead germ. Oh,

459
01:05:26,969 --> 01:05:31,210
they have the, we can get the best. They got the best loot because the dragon flies wear jewelry.

460
01:05:34,219 --> 01:05:39,449
Hey, Chad, how do you shoot three hour arrows at a time with the bow? Does anyone know?

461
01:05:39,449 --> 01:05:45,050
I think it's a, it's a skill. Okay. You got to go have that in the skill menu.

462
01:05:45,050 --> 01:06:01,380
It's a skill you didn't choose. Oh, there you go. When is GTA six coming out? Um, I think like,

463
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:07,429
probably, I don't know, like two years maybe. Hey, sir. Yeah. Uh, can you, can you wear that,

464
01:06:07,429 --> 01:06:15,000
that outfit? Where? Right here. Okay. And I would definitely put it on. Circle's coming.

465
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:24,809
We got some problems here. This water looks scrumptious. It kind of does.

466
01:06:24,809 --> 01:06:31,420
Looks like ecto cooler. Yeah, it is very green. It's green, but it's very like transparently

467
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:37,980
green. So it's just like that. Hey, hey, German men, this zombie is wearing some sick pants, dude.

468
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:42,139
You definitely don't have pants better than that. It's Nyquil. Yeah, I guess you could boil some

469
01:06:42,139 --> 01:06:54,329
chicken in this. Right. This Zambi, dude, you got to check this Zambi. This Nyquil chicken.

470
01:06:54,329 --> 01:07:05,639
Oh, blue. Plate pants. If you need them. What do I even have in my pants right now?

471
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:18,710
Is this water or jello? Like lime jello. Something in between. I have plate boots.

472
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:26,500
Want to double it. Want any armor? Okay. Yeah, one of those zombies had plate leggings.

473
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,780
Oh, leggings. Actually, yeah, actually, I probably could use those. Let me go back there.

474
01:07:32,219 --> 01:07:36,059
Slapping around. I mean, I love the sound in this game that I was telling, like,

475
01:07:36,059 --> 01:07:39,960
I was playing with my mods the other day, and it's like half of the sound effects in this game

476
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:47,500
are just feet slapping on like wet concrete or like dry concrete. The penguin walk.

477
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:51,900
Just penguins walking. Just sounds like penguins walking around. Yeah, I guess it does. It's like,

478
01:07:55,980 --> 01:08:02,889
now my chat wants to drink the green water. They really want it. I missed. Let's see.

479
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:11,880
Heavy gauntlet green would be good for you. It is. Thank you. How does, uh, how's healing

480
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:20,149
working in this? It is red potions, a cleric, or, um, you have bandages or skills.

481
01:08:21,189 --> 01:08:24,470
I have some extra bandages there if you want to come grab them off me.

482
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:36,789
Yeah. I just fell back in the water. Great. Okay. Uh, oh, hey, Vinny. Yep. On the ground.

483
01:08:36,789 --> 01:08:45,289
Oh, nice. Oh, awesome. Thank you. Uh, hey, creepo man, if you're asked about health,

484
01:08:45,289 --> 01:08:49,529
sometimes there's random shrines that just do different things. This one is a full heel.

485
01:08:49,529 --> 01:08:56,340
Interesting. Yeah. You might, you might want that. I'm praying to my God. Nice. It was an awesome

486
01:08:56,340 --> 01:09:04,619
God. Whoever it is. I'm sure they're awesome. The dark lord bathroom. Uh, portals have started to

487
01:09:04,619 --> 01:09:10,090
spawn and sir, you were asking, like you were asking randomly, like what the fuck's going on?

488
01:09:10,819 --> 01:09:15,380
Only one person can go in a portal and they spawn randomly in the area. So it's just kind of a mess

489
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:19,859
to try to find one eventually. And there's only, there are not enough portals for everybody to get

490
01:09:19,859 --> 01:09:24,250
out. Indeed. Yeah. And if it's a red portal, that'll take you to the next floor, which is

491
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:28,729
way more difficult. So maybe you don't take those right away people. Hello there travelers. We are

492
01:09:28,729 --> 01:09:33,369
friendly. We have my head, which would take for you. No, you do not want to attack. Oh, they want

493
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:41,079
to go. They want to go. They want to go. I would recommend against it. We are heavily armed. I'm

494
01:09:41,079 --> 01:09:56,199
dead. Come on. Creepo man. It's up to you now. Creepo man. You, you gotta, I have, I have actually

495
01:09:56,199 --> 01:10:01,159
a lot of stuff. Yeah. You were at this point right now, sir, just try to find a blue portal and do

496
01:10:01,159 --> 01:10:07,989
not engage anybody and closed doors behind you too. That's a good strategy. Yeah. Your goal is

497
01:10:07,989 --> 01:10:13,270
to go through that room. Yeah. Just, just, just try to find a blue portal as the only goal you have

498
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:26,069
and do not engage and just hide and sneak around. Oh, I'm a gamer. We'll see. Chad, are you sure

499
01:10:26,069 --> 01:10:30,500
they can hear me with my audio settings as they are right now? I don't think I could hear you in

500
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:35,060
game, but I kind of walked away. So I don't know. That's so funny. We kind of just, if they couldn't

501
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:38,020
hear you, we were just kind of seeing how they reacted. We just kind of was standing there and

502
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:43,500
I got hit in the head with an arrow. Yeah, basically it's like, oh, these, these three,

503
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:53,380
these three guys just stand still free headshot. Oh my God. Creepo man. What?

504
01:10:56,180 --> 01:11:03,979
That's an escape portal, my friend. Yep. Blue portals where cross the way on that right there,

505
01:11:03,979 --> 01:11:07,979
right next to you. That one, that blue one, you just have to activate it. It takes about 10

506
01:11:07,979 --> 01:11:14,100
seconds to activate and anybody can walk through it. I can't believe you're going to make it, dude.

507
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:23,640
Creepo man. You're going to make it. You're going to make it. Nice creeped on. Nice work. So now

508
01:11:24,279 --> 01:11:28,760
you go to your, you know, your stash and this is where you make the decision on,

509
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:35,079
Hey bro, do I want to bring something with me next time? Or do you stash it to make sure you can keep

510
01:11:35,079 --> 01:11:41,939
it? Are you just, you're selling all your chalices and bangles? That's the, they have no other purpose

511
01:11:41,939 --> 01:11:48,520
to the collector collector collector. And then, can you hear me in game right now? You hear an

512
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:52,520
echo? Yes, I do. Sick. Okay. So yeah, those dudes heard us and then they killed us.

513
01:11:54,039 --> 01:12:02,550
Yeah. I heard you guys talk to them and I walked away. Oh, okay. Um, I'm sorry. I have,

514
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:13,140
I have a ethical question. I have a purple, I like an epic chest that you could wear right now.

515
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:19,220
Me? No, Vinny. I have, it's for a ranger. It's literally purple and it's okay. Oh, was I supposed

516
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:26,420
to drop you that bow? I had it the whole time. Oh yeah. But the reason why it's unethical and I

517
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:30,020
don't care if you lose it or if you die with it. It's just because I may have accidentally

518
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:36,409
BM stole this from somebody. What do you mean you stole it from someone? How? Like in game or what?

519
01:12:36,409 --> 01:12:42,409
We fought a monster and like it was a solo game and it was a bunch of chaos everywhere and people

520
01:12:42,409 --> 01:12:47,289
were fighting and dying. And I just, we killed this boss thing and then there's like three or

521
01:12:47,289 --> 01:12:52,819
four other people started attacking each other. And I just grabbed everything and ran in a portal.

522
01:12:52,819 --> 01:12:57,300
No, that's fine. Oh, that's why they make these games. I don't think that's an ethical quandary.

523
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:07,750
I think that's real. Wait, wait, wait. Bandages are 45 gold. Not what happened. Isn't that a rip

524
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:18,380
off? That stir. Welcome to dark and darker. It's fucking fabric. Well stir, that's a pack of three.

525
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:23,739
Also don't ever buy the expensive one. Buy the one that's 10. It's 15 gold. Oh, I didn't see that

526
01:13:23,739 --> 01:13:30,520
they were different. That's for like rich Andes that have like thousands of gold. I got like 35

527
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:39,239
gold that run. Is that is that better than your second run? I don't know. I was also alone. Okay,

528
01:13:39,239 --> 01:13:45,960
me too. In the end, we're all alone. All right, you guys. Yeah, I'm ready. That's right. As for

529
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:51,479
that. Yeah, you can hold on to that for if you play an archer. I don't think I deserve that.

530
01:13:51,479 --> 01:13:57,350
I'll die. What's the question stir? Well, I have it in the menu item to purchase bandage.

531
01:13:57,350 --> 01:14:02,710
How do I actually buy it? Okay, so you're going to click it and you can say fill in all stash

532
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:07,270
because that's like hey, I have the money wherever and just send this a make deal. Oh, I thought that

533
01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:15,640
meant like fill my whole stash with as many of these as I can possibly buy. And how do you

534
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:22,140
know between your torch and your bandage? Oh, three and four. You're like item slots. You can

535
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:31,109
switch between them. You just cycle. You have. Yeah, you have three slots per. Okay, I knew chat

536
01:14:31,109 --> 01:14:37,369
was gonna say fill my hole after stir said that I knew it. I'm gonna knock. I'm only gonna bring

537
01:14:37,369 --> 01:14:41,449
a couple bandages. We're still kind of still learning. Well, some of us are, but you know,

538
01:14:41,449 --> 01:14:49,819
whatever. Oh, stir, by the way, come look at the dog. Look at the dog's name. I saw on your stream.

539
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:58,199
I did watch quite a bit auto. That's man. It's weird. They'd name it like a cat that but close.

540
01:14:58,199 --> 01:15:05,670
Yeah, I heard about that. Do you think that's a reference? I'm probably gonna say no. I kind

541
01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:11,109
of feel like it might be. I mean, it's autos pretty famous at this point. He's a pretty he's a pretty

542
01:15:11,109 --> 01:15:17,829
well known dog. Yeah, but auto is like just a cool name. I think so. I thought you'd I actually

543
01:15:17,829 --> 01:15:23,609
thought it's a dog, right? Dog auto. Yes, because you said cat a second ago. That's the in game.

544
01:15:23,609 --> 01:15:32,810
Sorry. Well, the in the game is a cat. He has a dog is I thought it was a UTO like automobile like

545
01:15:32,810 --> 01:15:41,460
a car at one point. Yeah. Oh, sir. You got that bow. Oh, yeah. Hold on skeleton. All right, let's

546
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:45,140
get the skeleton dropping the bow down here in the light. Check this out. Check out and check this

547
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:55,500
out. Check out this really nice. Thank you. I don't think there are charged. I don't think so. But

548
01:15:55,500 --> 01:16:01,659
you do get combos when you continue attacking and the combos are good. Sword here. I'm sorry. I'm

549
01:16:01,659 --> 01:16:08,979
still asking questions. No, no. Push to talk. I think it's B but I rebound it. So I don't know.

550
01:16:08,979 --> 01:16:17,159
Pretty sure it's B. It is B. That's weird. Now ask as many questions you want because this game

551
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:22,550
is kind of like like what the hell is happening? I don't know what's going on. And I think a lot

552
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:26,869
of people maybe open this game and play for like 20 minutes and go, this is stupid. And they did

553
01:16:26,869 --> 01:16:31,609
kind of it's like it's almost like, oh, shit. Wait. Okay. I almost like when you first I remember

554
01:16:31,609 --> 01:16:36,229
when I first played Dark Souls, and I remember just running around in circles, not understanding

555
01:16:36,229 --> 01:16:44,140
anything behind us. There's a group behind us in the door where we started. Yeah, creepos going

556
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:50,149
in the hole. Wait in the hole. Oh, they're here. Oh, they're behind us in this store. All right.

557
01:16:50,149 --> 01:16:56,250
What do you guys want to go hole or creepo strategy and just like, yeah, yeah, why we could

558
01:16:56,250 --> 01:17:13,050
put your torches down? Oh, yeah. This is like, like, Tarkov is one of those games that I just

559
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:17,899
it just didn't click with me. Yeah. And this is very similar to Tarkov, but I feel a little bit

560
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:24,229
more user friendly to start. Also, Dark Souls, they're coming through that door. I'm still back

561
01:17:24,229 --> 01:17:32,630
here. They come through. Okay, they might be engaging. I don't know. I think I think we'll

562
01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:36,470
come back here. Let's fight them. And also, but don't come back here because I threw caltrops in

563
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:42,949
front of the door. We will lose. We will lose. Okay. It was like one. It was like one ranger.

564
01:17:42,949 --> 01:17:51,000
Maybe. Yeah. Games like this because I reason why I'm saying ask as many questions as you want.

565
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,319
I played this for like 30 minutes, 40 minutes, and I was like, this is the worst game I've ever

566
01:17:55,319 --> 01:18:01,819
played. I was like, this is probably the worst game I've ever played. And it took me like an

567
01:18:01,819 --> 01:18:06,310
hour or two to be like, wait, this actually is like one of the most fun things I've ever done.

568
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:10,579
Yeah, really. This clicks where Tarkov didn't for me, which is weird because you know what

569
01:18:10,579 --> 01:18:16,180
Bloodborne clicked for me 100%. But Dark Souls never did. And I've gone back to Dark Souls like

570
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:21,590
three times and I still have not. I just have no desire to return to it. But I love Elden Ring,

571
01:18:21,590 --> 01:18:27,189
completed it like fully loved Sekiro, loved Bloodborne. I tried Dark Souls just didn't,

572
01:18:27,189 --> 01:18:31,189
it was just too much for me. And I'm getting shit from that. I'm getting shit for that from my chat

573
01:18:31,189 --> 01:18:40,500
from people who know that story already. God damn it. Okay, no, I am confused how I take out the

574
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:47,699
bandages. Like no button. They're all on one of your slots. Oh, I see. Okay, I got it. Yeah.

575
01:18:47,699 --> 01:18:53,350
And it takes about 10 seconds. Hold. It's not very much but it's enough to kind of. I think I'm rogue

576
01:18:53,350 --> 01:18:59,819
so I get like the super action speed. Yeah, that would be resourcefulness. It's a stat. It's an

577
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:04,949
insanely important stat eventually here because it just lets you do things so quickly. Some classes

578
01:19:04,949 --> 01:19:09,430
have awful resourcefulness. Cleric is like one of the slowest in the whole game, right?

579
01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:16,979
But Star, you are going to inevitably take more damage if you're naked. Yeah, but I'm not going

580
01:19:16,979 --> 01:19:23,819
to take any because I'm going to be evasive. You know, I know that I had a dodge. Okay. Yeah,

581
01:19:23,819 --> 01:19:30,279
getting getting over the initial hump of I don't get it. I died to the first skeleton and like I

582
01:19:30,279 --> 01:19:35,880
don't get it. It is if you can get over it and like try to understand it, then it's like, oh,

583
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:40,439
wow, this is actually really fun, which goes for most things, right? But yeah, yeah, you have to

584
01:19:40,439 --> 01:19:45,079
give it the time. I guess you do have to. Yeah, this one deserves the time because it's it's

585
01:19:45,079 --> 01:19:52,119
rewarding. It's really worth it. But also, sir, if you want to know red, like a red skeleton or

586
01:19:52,119 --> 01:19:59,210
like a red spider is a elite, which means there is obviously elite and they hurt and but they

587
01:19:59,210 --> 01:20:09,239
have more stuff. There's also another mode that I would like to try at some point tonight. It's

588
01:20:09,239 --> 01:20:16,439
called high roller and we have to pay 100 gold to go in, but it's much harder and much more better

589
01:20:16,439 --> 01:20:21,350
stuff drops. I'll tell you when you when you end up playing with like Kraken or whoever,

590
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:24,310
yeah, you could do that one because I have zero I have no money on this character.

591
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:34,010
But that sounds that sounds like butt clenching. Yep. Is there any way to tell if a chest is a

592
01:20:34,010 --> 01:20:40,470
mimic? I don't know. You just kind of have to find out. But you you have enough time to run from the

593
01:20:40,470 --> 01:20:57,060
mimic. That's the one saving grace. Maybe if you hit it. Oh, big, big door, big, big scary door.

594
01:20:57,060 --> 01:21:02,359
It is a big scary door. That means there's a big thing in there. Yeah. In there, there's like a

595
01:21:02,359 --> 01:21:07,859
wizard or a champion or something. I'm not mistaken. And also, we're as we get closer here,

596
01:21:07,859 --> 01:21:12,520
tons of people are going to be kind of collapsing on these rooms and we could just get just dumped

597
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:21,720
on. Yeah, I'm I'm decent shield here for you, Jerma. Oh, I just found a skeleton. Oh, buckler

598
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:30,729
or I'll take it. But yeah, I got the one I have more defense. You guys want to go in the omega

599
01:21:30,729 --> 01:21:36,060
door or do you want to leave it alone? Let's get the skeleton first so we don't get ganged up on

600
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:45,100
by skeletons. All right. I closed the door. There's a lot. There was a lot of skeletons by the door.

601
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:49,720
Yeah, we could probably kill them. Let's go close the doors behind us. Make sure you know.

602
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:54,840
Well, there's skeletons up here, too. We can systematically kind of like go from up to down

603
01:21:54,840 --> 01:22:01,939
and I can like snipe some skeletons that we can we can make it work. I think. Is there any shield

604
01:22:01,939 --> 01:22:17,500
that the rogue can use? Oh, Vinny, Vinny, you're going to want to take a look at that. Oh, it's

605
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:27,430
another blue one. Do you need to take advantage? Thanks. You want this? We want this big mega chest

606
01:22:28,149 --> 01:22:35,029
circles coming. You can open it because you can pick locks. I have never picked a lock in the

607
01:22:35,029 --> 01:22:42,359
circles right here, so I don't I don't want to jump in the death room. I mean, it also stirred

608
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:46,920
that white altar there. That's a shrine of resurrection. Like if you have my if I die

609
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:56,359
and you take my soul, you can resurrect me. OK, OK. Nobody else is here. I mean, you could just

610
01:22:56,359 --> 01:23:00,520
try to run over there and just snipe it. But oh, there's an exit portal across the hall,

611
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:06,119
like across the like on the other banister over there. Anybody want to get out now?

612
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:14,140
I'm kind of like in this the hardcore permadeath mode I'm playing with Creepo Man right now.

613
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:19,909
It's never known the touch of death. I mean, I do have some decent bows now, so I might I might go.

614
01:23:19,909 --> 01:23:23,909
Oh, and I got a ranger. Oh, man. Yeah. Yeah, I have some decent stuff. I should probably leave.

615
01:23:23,909 --> 01:23:27,880
Vinny, you should you should get out of here. Let me see if I even can. Oh, there's a skeleton

616
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:43,420
behind us. I forgot the Ranger has food that you can use. Give me a burger. He's in a really

617
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:51,000
weird spot. Yeah, I can make it. OK, cool. Appropriately, I took the creep perk,

618
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:56,819
which makes my my crouch walking, I think make less noise. Oh, another one.

619
01:23:57,460 --> 01:24:01,699
Oh, but it still sounds like it makes a lot of noise when I'm crouching.

620
01:24:01,699 --> 01:24:11,720
Is that is that imaginary? I think you I think you you always make noise, I think. But there's a

621
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:15,899
group in here. I mean, we could kind of and there's a red portal. He went the other way.

622
01:24:15,899 --> 01:24:24,949
Can you get a little greedy stone cleric in here? Just one. They're probably together.

623
01:24:24,949 --> 01:24:30,100
I only see one. You try to go for the jump. No, this too. There's a cleric and an archer.

624
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:34,060
And now there's three people. OK, well, they just killed somebody. We can we can sneak up

625
01:24:34,060 --> 01:24:39,350
behind him. There's a fourth guy in here taking an exit portal, taking the portal up there.

626
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:48,569
They're attacking. I'm going to I'm going to engage this to this three chat.

627
01:24:48,569 --> 01:24:51,130
What button goes to first person again in spectator mode?

628
01:24:54,649 --> 01:24:59,319
That's the try to get out of there, sir. Yeah, I'll try.

629
01:24:59,319 --> 01:25:06,500
Oh, it's literally on the screen. Wow, that's amazing. Oh, you're dead.

630
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:09,819
Jeremy, you're dead. Yes. Three of you one.

631
01:25:09,819 --> 01:25:13,430
Did you have anything? No, not really.

632
01:25:13,430 --> 01:25:19,579
OK, well, stirred for your first time playing. You've been escaping a lot.

633
01:25:20,539 --> 01:25:26,279
When I first played this game in December, I probably it took me two hours of gameplay,

634
01:25:26,279 --> 01:25:28,920
a failure to escape one time. I'm OK.

635
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:32,890
Dying. I'm OK. Dying and being like the bait there.

636
01:25:32,890 --> 01:25:36,409
So you can leave with blue and stir. You can leave and make some money.

637
01:25:36,409 --> 01:25:39,529
I got plenty of money. I'm all right here. I got plenty of money.

638
01:25:39,529 --> 01:25:42,979
I'm already taking the yell. Good, good man.

639
01:25:43,699 --> 01:25:50,859
Yeah, that's a good man. All right. I can do one or two more if you guys want.

640
01:25:50,859 --> 01:25:54,140
And, you know, I know you'd want to change out, get some other people in.

641
01:25:54,220 --> 01:25:59,239
Wait, what? Yeah, I mean, pretty much we got like a little group here

642
01:25:59,239 --> 01:26:05,699
where everyone wants to jump in and out. Yo, 84 gold.

643
01:26:05,699 --> 01:26:11,819
Yeah, that's how you make money. Are you saying you just made 84 gold?

644
01:26:11,819 --> 01:26:15,750
Yeah, from that run. Yeah, that's that's a lot.

645
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:19,819
I don't feel like very good. At what point do I like,

646
01:26:19,819 --> 01:26:24,069
you know, like buy a dagger or something?

647
01:26:24,069 --> 01:26:27,510
Money is you really want to spend your money on the utility stuff.

648
01:26:27,510 --> 01:26:29,989
So, for instance, go to at least early on here,

649
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:36,859
go to merchants and go to the alchemist buying potions and bandages.

650
01:26:37,979 --> 01:26:39,819
That's kind of early where you want to spend your money

651
01:26:39,819 --> 01:26:43,449
because it means you just get to live longer.

652
01:26:43,449 --> 01:26:46,810
But, I mean, by all means, buy a sword, buy a weapon.

653
01:26:46,810 --> 01:26:50,710
I mean, some of them are expensive.

654
01:26:50,710 --> 01:26:54,659
Yeah, and usually end up finding better ones in match anyway, but yeah.

655
01:26:54,659 --> 01:26:59,829
Okay. But slowly, but surely,

656
01:26:59,829 --> 01:27:04,069
you'll kind of increase your survivability because as you notice now, it's just sort of,

657
01:27:04,149 --> 01:27:07,319
oh, I took I'm at 50 percent HP.

658
01:27:07,319 --> 01:27:10,520
Okay, well, I'm dead if we find groups of enemies or something.

659
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:14,279
Or if you let's say you kill somebody and you're at like 10 percent HP.

660
01:27:14,279 --> 01:27:19,560
If you had bought three potions, it's like, okay, maybe I could keep going and leave and get out.

661
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:22,279
So you're essentially trying to survive to the point where you get

662
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:25,880
more and more and more good stuff to then hold on to it.

663
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,479
But then when you're like, all right, this is the time,

664
01:27:27,479 --> 01:27:30,949
this is the run where I'm putting this shit on and we're going to go hard.

665
01:27:30,949 --> 01:27:38,310
That's what you do. Another question.

666
01:27:39,159 --> 01:27:41,399
No, go for rogue specific.

667
01:27:41,399 --> 01:27:44,359
I took the cow traps and it feels like when I use them,

668
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:48,899
I throw them on my own feet and then roll in them and there's nothing I can do about it.

669
01:27:48,899 --> 01:27:50,579
You can get hurt by your own stuff.

670
01:27:50,579 --> 01:27:57,270
Yes. Well, I mean, like I use it and then I there's not even a chance for me to not get hurt by it.

671
01:27:57,270 --> 01:28:00,069
Huh? Yeah, they suck.

672
01:28:00,069 --> 01:28:02,069
They feel like they are designed for you.

673
01:28:02,069 --> 01:28:04,840
Like you rub them on yourself.

674
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:06,520
They drop behind you.

675
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:11,399
Oh, I've been like looking at the ground and then walking backwards to get away from them.

676
01:28:12,789 --> 01:28:15,829
So you're like you're flattening your own tires.

677
01:28:15,829 --> 01:28:16,630
That's funny.

678
01:28:16,630 --> 01:28:19,109
Yeah, I guess I've been flattening my own tires.

679
01:28:19,109 --> 01:28:21,510
It's not like Team Fortress classic cow traps.

680
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:22,390
That's funny.

681
01:28:22,390 --> 01:28:28,899
All right, we pick pocketing.

682
01:28:28,899 --> 01:28:31,180
Is there? Oh, I don't know.

683
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:34,300
Rogue, you can steal an enemy's item from the dungeon.

684
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:35,819
What is that? What does that even mean?

685
01:28:35,819 --> 01:28:36,699
That's pretty cool.

686
01:28:36,699 --> 01:28:43,689
Someone in my chat just said if Jerma had a normal job, he'd be such a nice trainer.

687
01:28:43,689 --> 01:28:45,340
Hey, thank you.

688
01:28:45,340 --> 01:28:46,380
Yeah, it's nice.

689
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:49,479
I mean, trust me, I do not know that much about this game,

690
01:28:49,479 --> 01:28:56,840
but I know enough to at the very least explain some very small basic details.

691
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:57,720
And that's pretty much it.

692
01:28:57,720 --> 01:29:01,579
Yeah. Yeah, no, it's pretty important stuff.

693
01:29:01,579 --> 01:29:02,699
So this is good. This is helpful.

694
01:29:02,699 --> 01:29:03,180
Okay.

695
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:05,100
Okay, you guys make friends with someone.

696
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:07,100
I will pick pocket them.

697
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:07,600
Okay.

698
01:29:08,939 --> 01:29:10,060
That's the plan. I'm ready.

699
01:29:10,060 --> 01:29:13,979
All right, I'll try to be really cool and personable to someone if we run across them.

700
01:29:13,979 --> 01:29:16,090
Oh, hold on.

701
01:29:16,090 --> 01:29:19,289
I'll find some clothes so that I can look like reputable.

702
01:29:19,289 --> 01:29:29,420
What's the push talk you said B?

703
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:29,739
Yeah.

704
01:29:30,659 --> 01:29:31,939
Like burple.

705
01:29:31,939 --> 01:29:32,819
B for burple.

706
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:42,890
Yeah, what's wrong with my character's name?

707
01:29:42,890 --> 01:29:43,390
Ow.

708
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:47,460
I don't like the sound of that.

709
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:48,020
Dude, the one-

710
01:29:48,020 --> 01:29:49,220
Someone just hurt the dog.

711
01:29:49,220 --> 01:29:50,819
I know. It's not cool.

712
01:29:50,819 --> 01:29:52,500
But it's always funny the first one second,

713
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:55,460
somebody just always gets hit with a sword and shot with an arrow and then we leave.

714
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:57,619
The devs are so dedicated that made this game.

715
01:29:57,619 --> 01:30:02,659
They killed their own dog for that.

716
01:30:02,659 --> 01:30:04,260
You're a fucking maniac.

717
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:05,300
The devs.

718
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:06,500
That is maniacal.

719
01:30:10,939 --> 01:30:14,699
What's wrong with you?

720
01:30:14,699 --> 01:30:15,979
Oh, nice. You got gloves.

721
01:30:16,539 --> 01:30:17,659
Oh, do I?

722
01:30:17,659 --> 01:30:19,340
I didn't even know I picked up gloves.

723
01:30:19,979 --> 01:30:21,420
That's a power move.

724
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:24,140
There's no clothes, underwear, and gloves.

725
01:30:24,140 --> 01:30:27,100
Those are like Homer Simpson gloves.

726
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:28,300
These are my pick pocket gloves.

727
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:31,270
It's like radioactive gloves.

728
01:30:31,270 --> 01:30:32,869
Radioactive.

729
01:30:32,869 --> 01:30:36,229
There's a really big treasure chest in here.

730
01:30:36,229 --> 01:30:40,310
But this room is going to become-

731
01:30:40,310 --> 01:30:45,989
Okay, so there's a mage and that's all spike traps over there.

732
01:30:45,989 --> 01:30:49,079
I'm going to go for the mage.

733
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:52,859
We shouldn't even get near this

734
01:30:52,859 --> 01:30:55,029
because you probably would range it and kill it.

735
01:30:55,029 --> 01:30:57,350
Well, the spike traps are going to hurt it, too.

736
01:30:57,350 --> 01:31:04,470
Oh, that's right.

737
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:05,350
Nice dodge.

738
01:31:05,350 --> 01:31:07,590
That was actually very, very well.

739
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:08,229
That was great.

740
01:31:09,029 --> 01:31:11,350
Yeah, like jumped over it.

741
01:31:11,350 --> 01:31:17,750
Yeah, I don't know how I did it, but wizard robe and stuff.

742
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:19,220
Oh, stir.

743
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:20,260
Yeah, pretty well, man.

744
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:21,060
This is all you.

745
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:25,109
This is all you.

746
01:31:25,109 --> 01:31:26,970
This one we can open.

747
01:31:26,970 --> 01:31:30,090
You do not have sufficient skills items to do this.

748
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:32,090
Oh, do you have to?

749
01:31:32,090 --> 01:31:33,529
Oh, because I don't have the perk.

750
01:31:33,529 --> 01:31:35,369
Oh, yeah, I took pick pocket.

751
01:31:35,850 --> 01:31:36,489
Can we break it?

752
01:31:36,489 --> 01:31:44,039
Oh, I think so, but then you lose items or maybe for the regular chest.

753
01:31:44,039 --> 01:31:44,600
Can you open?

754
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:45,720
Oh, no, you can't open this one either.

755
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:46,119
Never mind.

756
01:31:46,119 --> 01:31:46,840
Oh, skeleton.

757
01:31:48,279 --> 01:31:52,359
Maybe in the future I could have the lockpick so that I'm useful to someone.

758
01:31:54,520 --> 01:32:00,460
Lockpick seems very, very, very good.

759
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:07,380
Feels like there's a lot of chests that are locked in every single game.

760
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:09,619
Okay, can we check the loot here?

761
01:32:10,579 --> 01:32:11,060
Falchion.

762
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:15,340
Jerma, you might want a white falchion.

763
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:16,460
It's not bad.

764
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:17,100
Yeah, I'll take it.

765
01:32:17,659 --> 01:32:18,699
What was that, sir?

766
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:19,659
What's in there?

767
01:32:19,659 --> 01:32:21,100
Just a couple of flying skulls.

768
01:32:21,819 --> 01:32:22,300
Okay.

769
01:32:23,670 --> 01:32:24,069
All right.

770
01:32:26,789 --> 01:32:29,579
We should probably go towards the circle.

771
01:32:29,579 --> 01:32:32,460
Yeah, there's going to be flying skulls.

772
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:34,710
So let's get them.

773
01:32:37,979 --> 01:32:40,060
You can't disarm any of these traps.

774
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:41,739
Or can you with like a perk or something?

775
01:32:42,619 --> 01:32:43,659
I think there was a trap.

776
01:32:44,619 --> 01:32:45,420
Oh, there's spiders.

777
01:32:47,619 --> 01:32:48,739
Red spiders.

778
01:32:48,739 --> 01:32:51,130
Yeah, I got the light.

779
01:32:52,409 --> 01:32:55,220
You got this.

780
01:32:55,220 --> 01:32:55,939
Okay.

781
01:32:55,939 --> 01:33:00,460
Damn, it's a bandage.

782
01:33:02,199 --> 01:33:04,199
You know, is the lantern any good?

783
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:10,260
Oh, you can aim the light.

784
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:11,859
I thought it was just like the thing that sat on your hip.

785
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:13,640
That's what it is.

786
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:14,520
You aim it.

787
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:15,399
That's cool.

788
01:33:15,399 --> 01:33:20,979
Jerma, here, why don't you...

789
01:33:20,979 --> 01:33:21,619
Oh, shit.

790
01:33:22,819 --> 01:33:23,140
Hang on.

791
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:24,500
Let's take care of these bugs first.

792
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:25,300
We'll talk.

793
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:27,460
Oh, this is a spawner.

794
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:27,939
This pot.

795
01:33:27,939 --> 01:33:28,819
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

796
01:33:28,819 --> 01:33:29,300
You got it.

797
01:33:29,300 --> 01:33:29,699
Okay.

798
01:33:29,699 --> 01:33:33,699
That's a lot of bugs.

799
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:43,539
All right.

800
01:33:44,819 --> 01:33:45,220
You look so funny.

801
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:46,260
I'm pushing here for you, Jerma.

802
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:47,619
Oh, they're eating me.

803
01:33:50,420 --> 01:33:52,020
You should take the potion at this point.

804
01:33:52,020 --> 01:33:52,500
Oh, this is...

805
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:53,060
No, I have...

806
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:53,779
I have healing.

807
01:33:53,779 --> 01:33:54,979
I have self-heal.

808
01:34:00,579 --> 01:34:01,939
There's a lot of shit in here.

809
01:34:01,939 --> 01:34:04,090
I'm hearing a lot of noise.

810
01:34:04,090 --> 01:34:04,409
Yeah.

811
01:34:04,409 --> 01:34:05,529
They're eating her.

812
01:34:05,529 --> 01:34:06,489
And then they're going to eat me.

813
01:34:07,210 --> 01:34:08,090
Oh, my God.

814
01:34:11,369 --> 01:34:12,489
Bunch of enemies in here.

815
01:34:12,489 --> 01:34:13,770
Let's let them come through the door.

816
01:34:14,649 --> 01:34:16,729
I can shoot them through the door as well.

817
01:34:17,529 --> 01:34:19,020
Take a while, but...

818
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:27,270
Oh, God.

819
01:34:27,270 --> 01:34:27,750
He's got me.

820
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:33,930
Nice.

821
01:34:35,979 --> 01:34:37,100
There's a spawner in there.

822
01:34:38,390 --> 01:34:38,630
All right.

823
01:34:38,630 --> 01:34:39,989
He had a diamond.

824
01:34:39,989 --> 01:34:40,550
Is that...

825
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:42,229
Do I kind of make it like a diamond armor set?

826
01:34:42,229 --> 01:34:43,670
Yo, careful, careful, careful.

827
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:45,189
Oh, I'm stuck.

828
01:34:45,189 --> 01:34:45,510
Who wants...

829
01:34:46,229 --> 01:34:47,029
Circle's coming in.

830
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:51,260
Who wants the fountain of speed or whatever?

831
01:34:51,899 --> 01:34:52,380
Lockpick.

832
01:34:55,060 --> 01:34:55,300
All right.

833
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:56,260
Let me get the spawner.

834
01:34:56,899 --> 01:34:57,699
Oh, that's not good.

835
01:34:57,699 --> 01:34:58,659
Oh, man.

836
01:35:00,659 --> 01:35:01,939
Whoa, I just got pulled.

837
01:35:01,939 --> 01:35:04,100
All right, we should go through the door.

838
01:35:07,979 --> 01:35:08,699
Careful, Sturrier.

839
01:35:08,699 --> 01:35:19,420
You're the only one in there.

840
01:35:19,420 --> 01:35:20,699
Hope I didn't just shoot you, Jerma.

841
01:35:20,699 --> 01:35:21,100
Did I?

842
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:21,659
Nope.

843
01:35:21,659 --> 01:35:25,670
Okay.

844
01:35:27,770 --> 01:35:29,529
You look like such a dickhead when you do that.

845
01:35:31,109 --> 01:35:31,750
Okay, so...

846
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:34,550
Looking down and just stabbing.

847
01:35:34,550 --> 01:35:37,189
This one is not locked, actually, this big chest.

848
01:35:41,779 --> 01:35:44,420
You guys can take some of the stuff in this big chest if you want.

849
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:44,819
I have a...

850
01:35:44,819 --> 01:35:45,699
Just to sell or whatever.

851
01:35:45,699 --> 01:35:46,899
I have a lockpick, but I've only...

852
01:35:47,460 --> 01:35:48,180
Oh, what was that?

853
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:49,380
Skeleton, skeleton shooting.

854
01:35:49,380 --> 01:35:50,020
Oh, shit.

855
01:35:50,020 --> 01:35:50,979
That's what it was.

856
01:35:50,979 --> 01:35:51,619
I got the door.

857
01:35:51,619 --> 01:35:52,260
I'm going to get the door.

858
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:52,979
I'm going to get the door.

859
01:35:52,979 --> 01:35:53,779
I'm going to get the door.

860
01:35:54,340 --> 01:35:54,659
Okay.

861
01:35:58,069 --> 01:35:58,789
Another skeleton.

862
01:35:59,350 --> 01:36:03,819
It's bleeding.

863
01:36:06,810 --> 01:36:07,930
Nice, Stur.

864
01:36:07,930 --> 01:36:08,250
Okay.

865
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:11,369
Is this a shrine of impactful speed, you said?

866
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:14,630
Yeah, there's that blue shrine.

867
01:36:15,590 --> 01:36:16,470
Sacrifice.

868
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:18,310
The blue one over there is extra speed,

869
01:36:18,310 --> 01:36:20,310
but it doesn't really last that long, so...

870
01:36:20,310 --> 01:36:24,439
Yeah, if you die, then yeah, that's where you bring somebody back.

871
01:36:24,439 --> 01:36:25,479
Shitty...

872
01:36:25,479 --> 01:36:27,399
Well, it's not shitty if it's green on this guy over here.

873
01:36:29,079 --> 01:36:31,369
Vinny, you should just take this.

874
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:34,180
You know, I'm going to take the shitty green anyway.

875
01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:35,529
Oh, what's this?

876
01:36:35,529 --> 01:36:36,090
The health?

877
01:36:37,130 --> 01:36:37,770
Sure.

878
01:36:37,770 --> 01:36:39,529
I mean, we all have full health.

879
01:36:39,529 --> 01:36:41,689
We're going to be getting out of here.

880
01:36:41,770 --> 01:36:43,689
Yeah, we got to get out of here like right now.

881
01:36:43,689 --> 01:36:46,010
Vinny, what are your final thoughts on Metroid Prime Remastered?

882
01:36:46,010 --> 01:36:48,489
I haven't finished it yet, so I don't have final thoughts, but it's good so far.

883
01:36:48,489 --> 01:36:49,590
Okay, let's get out of here.

884
01:36:49,590 --> 01:36:51,399
Yeah, let's get out.

885
01:36:51,399 --> 01:36:55,779
It's going to hurt.

886
01:36:55,779 --> 01:36:56,659
Yeah, this is going to hurt.

887
01:36:56,659 --> 01:37:00,220
Out, out, out, out, out.

888
01:37:00,220 --> 01:37:01,340
Trying to speed again.

889
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:03,000
All right, mine's still going.

890
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,880
Oh, Vinny, you can just take it.

891
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:06,279
All right.

892
01:37:08,699 --> 01:37:13,109
How do you holster again?

893
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:15,640
Okay.

894
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:16,439
What's down here?

895
01:37:16,439 --> 01:37:18,630
Whoa, wait.

896
01:37:18,630 --> 01:37:19,109
Big room.

897
01:37:19,829 --> 01:37:20,789
No, never mind.

898
01:37:20,789 --> 01:37:21,829
Just a little secret passage.

899
01:37:21,829 --> 01:37:22,869
That's a connector.

900
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:24,680
Don't see anyone.

901
01:37:28,710 --> 01:37:31,289
This place has been looted.

902
01:37:31,289 --> 01:37:33,210
Yeah, we're getting out of the final five minutes.

903
01:37:33,210 --> 01:37:38,699
This is going to start to get a little hairy.

904
01:37:38,699 --> 01:37:40,859
Oh, there's a mimic down there.

905
01:37:40,859 --> 01:37:45,300
I don't know if it's still alive to the north.

906
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:47,689
Turn the roaster on.

907
01:37:47,689 --> 01:37:48,489
Turn the roaster off.

908
01:37:53,319 --> 01:37:57,640
We should just get out of here because we're going to get in trouble by the circle.

909
01:37:57,640 --> 01:37:59,399
Okay, careful with that jump.

910
01:37:59,399 --> 01:38:01,319
Yeah, make sure you're holstered before doing that jump.

911
01:38:02,439 --> 01:38:03,640
How do you do that again?

912
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:06,359
X.

913
01:38:06,359 --> 01:38:09,560
Um, shrine of protection.

914
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:12,760
I would recommend you get it, Star, because you're squishy.

915
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:13,960
Yeah, you have no gloves on.

916
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:15,640
Oh, you got us the gloves.

917
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:17,500
Right here, this red one.

918
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:19,510
Oh, there's a chest.

919
01:38:19,510 --> 01:38:21,260
Oh, okay.

920
01:38:21,260 --> 01:38:22,460
What is that?

921
01:38:22,460 --> 01:38:23,979
People coming, people coming.

922
01:38:23,979 --> 01:38:25,020
No, I'm just shooting this.

923
01:38:25,659 --> 01:38:27,100
No, there's people behind this door.

924
01:38:27,100 --> 01:38:27,420
Okay.

925
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:27,979
Oh, no shit.

926
01:38:29,699 --> 01:38:31,260
One guy.

927
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:32,380
Hey, you friendly?

928
01:38:32,380 --> 01:38:33,880
That's crap.

929
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:34,680
Okay, cool.

930
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:37,380
I got my boys down there.

931
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:38,739
Are they friendly?

932
01:38:38,739 --> 01:38:41,529
Are they friendly?

933
01:38:41,529 --> 01:38:42,489
We are friendly.

934
01:38:42,489 --> 01:38:44,329
Please do not kill.

935
01:38:44,329 --> 01:38:45,369
Oh, my goodness.

936
01:38:45,369 --> 01:38:46,250
They're friendly.

937
01:38:46,250 --> 01:38:47,050
Uh, open the door.

938
01:38:47,050 --> 01:38:47,689
They opened the portal.

939
01:38:49,989 --> 01:38:51,829
No, by George, we've just...

940
01:38:51,829 --> 01:38:53,909
Hey, no, no, we're all good here.

941
01:38:53,909 --> 01:38:54,550
How are you guys doing?

942
01:38:54,550 --> 01:38:54,869
Good?

943
01:38:54,869 --> 01:38:58,939
Just, just crouch three times if you're good.

944
01:38:58,939 --> 01:38:59,500
That's three.

945
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:00,220
That's awesome.

946
01:39:00,220 --> 01:39:01,829
That's good.

947
01:39:01,829 --> 01:39:04,949
But I say we should probably try to find a portal together.

948
01:39:04,949 --> 01:39:05,829
Stir lock, pick them.

949
01:39:06,390 --> 01:39:07,510
Or tick-tock it.

950
01:39:07,510 --> 01:39:09,000
He can hear, they can hear you.

951
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,189
Did I say that out loud?

952
01:39:11,189 --> 01:39:12,310
Did you talk in game?

953
01:39:13,430 --> 01:39:14,149
Guys, I was kidding.

954
01:39:14,149 --> 01:39:14,470
Come on.

955
01:39:14,470 --> 01:39:16,250
That was a joke.

956
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:16,890
Well, no, no.

957
01:39:16,890 --> 01:39:17,930
Oh, wait, they're coming back.

958
01:39:18,010 --> 01:39:18,489
They're coming back.

959
01:39:18,489 --> 01:39:19,210
Are they fighting?

960
01:39:19,210 --> 01:39:22,220
That's a pretty poor joke of you.

961
01:39:22,220 --> 01:39:23,020
We were just messing around.

962
01:39:23,020 --> 01:39:23,819
We were just messing around.

963
01:39:24,619 --> 01:39:25,180
We'll help you.

964
01:39:25,180 --> 01:39:26,779
We'll help you guys get out of here.

965
01:39:26,779 --> 01:39:27,979
We don't need to hurt each other.

966
01:39:27,979 --> 01:39:32,060
This is hard enough without violence, you know.

967
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:33,180
Oh, hey, no, no, no.

968
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:33,979
All of us are friends.

969
01:39:34,539 --> 01:39:35,899
There's like six of us.

970
01:39:35,899 --> 01:39:36,779
It's not worth it.

971
01:39:36,779 --> 01:39:37,500
It's not worth it.

972
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:38,779
No, no, no, no.

973
01:39:38,779 --> 01:39:39,180
Trust me.

974
01:39:39,899 --> 01:39:41,020
We're going to get out of here together.

975
01:39:41,020 --> 01:39:41,100
All of us.

976
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:43,579
Everybody just relax and let's do this diplomatically.

977
01:39:43,579 --> 01:39:45,020
No, we've literally just got in a fight.

978
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:46,380
We thought you guys were part of this team.

979
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:46,939
It's all good.

980
01:39:46,939 --> 01:39:47,659
It's all good.

981
01:39:47,899 --> 01:39:50,779
We're trying to get out with the loot that we have, too, gentlemen.

982
01:39:52,060 --> 01:39:53,020
What he said.

983
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:55,260
I picked pocket like six times.

984
01:39:57,659 --> 01:39:58,300
I found a portal.

985
01:39:58,300 --> 01:39:58,779
I'm getting out.

986
01:40:01,739 --> 01:40:03,180
This is I hate this.

987
01:40:03,180 --> 01:40:03,979
I hate this.

988
01:40:03,979 --> 01:40:05,420
I'm opening this fucking thing.

989
01:40:05,420 --> 01:40:08,460
I'm going to fucking get back to home base and be like, what?

990
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:08,939
What?

991
01:40:08,939 --> 01:40:11,020
I thought what the fuck was that?

992
01:40:11,579 --> 01:40:12,140
How did I do?

993
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:12,699
What do I do?

994
01:40:13,420 --> 01:40:15,020
Oh, I tried to open the chest.

995
01:40:15,020 --> 01:40:16,220
I seem to have messed up.

996
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:17,100
I didn't open it.

997
01:40:18,550 --> 01:40:19,989
See plenty of portals for all.

998
01:40:23,289 --> 01:40:23,529
Wow.

999
01:40:23,529 --> 01:40:24,569
We actually got out.

1000
01:40:24,569 --> 01:40:27,210
Probably should have given that lot pick to somebody that knew what they were doing.

1001
01:40:27,930 --> 01:40:29,609
I should have kept pick pocketing.

1002
01:40:29,609 --> 01:40:30,569
Jerma, just run through it.

1003
01:40:30,569 --> 01:40:31,050
Run through it.

1004
01:40:32,899 --> 01:40:33,220
Damn.

1005
01:40:34,180 --> 01:40:38,180
Is this like just like hang out near someone that's going to take a blue portal

1006
01:40:38,180 --> 01:40:39,859
and then just just run in at the last second?

1007
01:40:42,010 --> 01:40:43,210
Like a real asshole.

1008
01:40:43,210 --> 01:40:44,329
Oh, there's a portal here.

1009
01:40:44,329 --> 01:40:45,449
Did you really pick pocket?

1010
01:40:45,449 --> 01:40:46,569
Yeah, I'll offer it to him.

1011
01:40:49,770 --> 01:40:50,329
Thank you.

1012
01:40:50,329 --> 01:40:51,930
I really appreciate it.

1013
01:40:51,930 --> 01:40:53,050
Good luck in your journey.

1014
01:40:53,050 --> 01:40:54,569
Good luck in your adventures going forward.

1015
01:40:55,369 --> 01:40:57,689
Gentlemen, I bid you adieu.

1016
01:41:00,819 --> 01:41:01,300
We got it.

1017
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:02,500
I can't believe this worked.

1018
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:03,539
What?

1019
01:41:03,539 --> 01:41:07,539
I hate that.

1020
01:41:07,539 --> 01:41:08,260
I don't like this.

1021
01:41:09,380 --> 01:41:10,260
It's too awful.

1022
01:41:11,060 --> 01:41:11,699
It worked.

1023
01:41:12,260 --> 01:41:12,979
What did you take?

1024
01:41:13,859 --> 01:41:14,579
I'm not sure.

1025
01:41:14,579 --> 01:41:19,539
You just like hold a steel behind them and then it didn't like open a menu or anything.

1026
01:41:19,539 --> 01:41:21,640
So I don't know what I took.

1027
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:22,840
I have 10 silver coins.

1028
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:23,560
I don't think I had.

1029
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,840
It's jewelry usually.

1030
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:29,399
Yeah, I did not have these 10 silver coins.

1031
01:41:30,329 --> 01:41:31,529
So you stole silver.

1032
01:41:31,529 --> 01:41:32,810
They probably aren't even going to notice.

1033
01:41:34,140 --> 01:41:34,859
I'll be honest.

1034
01:41:34,859 --> 01:41:38,699
If like a few silver coins are gone from my pocket, I wouldn't even know.

1035
01:41:38,699 --> 01:41:40,460
Oh, I got like throwing knives.

1036
01:41:40,460 --> 01:41:41,340
I didn't have those.

1037
01:41:43,750 --> 01:41:48,550
This is democracy manifest.

1038
01:41:48,550 --> 01:41:49,430
That was amazing.

1039
01:41:49,430 --> 01:41:52,420
And we all made it somehow.

1040
01:41:52,420 --> 01:41:55,300
Like someone in my chat just said, I can't believe

1041
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:57,539
completely one-sided chatting with randos worked.

1042
01:41:58,439 --> 01:41:59,800
Like we don't even know what they're saying.

1043
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:05,180
We were just like talking over everybody being cartoon characters.

1044
01:42:05,180 --> 01:42:06,539
And then it would like work somehow.

1045
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:10,920
Jerma, there was no voice chat in the game last beta.

1046
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:11,800
This is brand new.

1047
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:13,079
So you couldn't negotiate.

1048
01:42:13,079 --> 01:42:16,439
And every time you ran into someone, it was almost a guaranteed death.

1049
01:42:16,439 --> 01:42:17,720
Yeah, that's funny.

1050
01:42:17,720 --> 01:42:20,710
All right.

1051
01:42:20,710 --> 01:42:22,149
Do you want me to hop out or?

1052
01:42:23,609 --> 01:42:24,729
Let's take a look.

1053
01:42:24,729 --> 01:42:27,609
I mean, I'm going to be playing this literally all night.

1054
01:42:27,609 --> 01:42:31,609
So, okay, if you want to stick around and there's other people that are, I mean, well,

1055
01:42:31,609 --> 01:42:33,930
I could do one more with you if that's cool.

1056
01:42:33,930 --> 01:42:37,850
Yeah, I'll do one more and then I'll bounce and I'll get some of my own groups going.

1057
01:42:37,850 --> 01:42:38,329
Yeah.

1058
01:42:38,329 --> 01:42:43,989
All right.

1059
01:42:43,989 --> 01:42:47,159
I'm thinking about going in with some gear this time.

1060
01:42:47,159 --> 01:42:51,369
Not thinking of thinking I should have pickpocketed more people.

1061
01:42:51,369 --> 01:42:55,670
Is this is this like a like, let's go for it round.

1062
01:42:55,670 --> 01:42:56,630
I'm down.

1063
01:42:56,630 --> 01:42:59,079
I mean, they went to the red portal.

1064
01:42:59,079 --> 01:43:02,920
I'm wondering if we were like, do you think we have the skill for a red portal?

1065
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:05,109
Probably not.

1066
01:43:05,109 --> 01:43:05,510
Right.

1067
01:43:05,510 --> 01:43:06,630
I mean, we could try it.

1068
01:43:06,630 --> 01:43:07,909
Why not even just try it?

1069
01:43:07,909 --> 01:43:08,899
Okay.

1070
01:43:08,899 --> 01:43:10,659
If we see red portal, we do.

1071
01:43:10,659 --> 01:43:12,340
If not, then we we leave.

1072
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:13,479
All right.

1073
01:43:13,479 --> 01:43:18,439
I'm going to bring at least like something like a better like, yeah, it's all right.

1074
01:43:18,439 --> 01:43:19,000
Well, you know what?

1075
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:19,479
You know, fuck it.

1076
01:43:19,479 --> 01:43:20,899
Let's just do it.

1077
01:43:20,899 --> 01:43:21,539
Okay.

1078
01:43:21,539 --> 01:43:22,500
Honest to goodness.

1079
01:43:23,640 --> 01:43:25,930
Let's play.

1080
01:43:25,930 --> 01:43:26,970
All right, gamers.

1081
01:43:26,970 --> 01:43:32,409
I'll be in rats.

1082
01:43:32,409 --> 01:43:34,920
What do you mean?

1083
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:36,039
I bought a Glock.

1084
01:43:36,039 --> 01:43:39,670
People saying do not go in red.

1085
01:43:39,670 --> 01:43:40,710
Where do you get that?

1086
01:43:40,710 --> 01:43:48,659
Yeah, we can just try it if we want to.

1087
01:43:48,659 --> 01:43:49,380
Well, we'll see.

1088
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:54,979
I mean, yeah, the one time I actually maybe two times I went to the red portal.

1089
01:43:54,979 --> 01:43:56,100
It was a nightmare.

1090
01:43:56,100 --> 01:43:56,340
Yeah.

1091
01:43:59,539 --> 01:44:00,420
Oh, that's a yawn.

1092
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:01,380
That was a dog yawn.

1093
01:44:01,380 --> 01:44:04,020
I thought someone donkey punched the dog last time.

1094
01:44:04,020 --> 01:44:05,899
Honest to goodness.

1095
01:44:05,899 --> 01:44:06,460
Let's game.

1096
01:44:15,270 --> 01:44:18,069
Ster is slowly adding a piece of clothing every run.

1097
01:44:18,069 --> 01:44:18,310
Yeah.

1098
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:20,840
Oh, do you have something new now?

1099
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:23,100
He's got a hood now.

1100
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:23,340
Yeah.

1101
01:44:23,899 --> 01:44:25,579
Yeah, I added something.

1102
01:44:25,579 --> 01:44:36,920
I'm evolving characters developing.

1103
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:38,760
Well, I'm literally just getting rid of trash.

1104
01:44:38,760 --> 01:44:39,800
Don't don't pick this stuff up.

1105
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:40,119
It's bad.

1106
01:44:40,119 --> 01:44:41,079
I need that.

1107
01:44:41,079 --> 01:44:44,680
Unless you need boots, which Jerma, you could actually probably benefit from.

1108
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:45,880
I could probably benefit from.

1109
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:47,239
Yeah, some of this just random stuff.

1110
01:44:47,239 --> 01:44:48,439
The gloves, too.

1111
01:44:48,439 --> 01:44:50,819
Fair enough.

1112
01:44:50,819 --> 01:44:52,579
Well, I'm so sorry.

1113
01:44:53,380 --> 01:44:54,020
You punch me.

1114
01:44:54,579 --> 01:44:57,939
Yeah, I clicked back into the game and just wailed on you.

1115
01:44:57,939 --> 01:45:00,729
Hey, this is supposed to be a red portal run.

1116
01:45:00,729 --> 01:45:03,930
And I'm already down like three or 4% health.

1117
01:45:03,930 --> 01:45:06,569
I mean, I can't even exit the door because you're standing in the way.

1118
01:45:06,569 --> 01:45:08,569
Well, I'm looking at you.

1119
01:45:08,569 --> 01:45:10,569
Oh, we were talking about eternal cylinder.

1120
01:45:10,569 --> 01:45:16,119
Yeah, I think generally we found that we were in generally the same part of the game

1121
01:45:16,119 --> 01:45:20,220
when we kind of both had some struggle with it.

1122
01:45:20,220 --> 01:45:23,340
But like my chat came into your chat and was like Vinny hated this game.

1123
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:24,779
I didn't hate it.

1124
01:45:24,779 --> 01:45:26,539
I liked it enough to finish it.

1125
01:45:26,539 --> 01:45:28,300
Yeah, it was it was a nice experience.

1126
01:45:28,300 --> 01:45:30,420
It just was a little too long.

1127
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:34,970
Yeah, like two or three hours too long.

1128
01:45:34,970 --> 01:45:37,850
Vinny donkey punch does not mean what you think it means.

1129
01:45:37,850 --> 01:45:38,810
Oh, oops.

1130
01:45:38,810 --> 01:45:39,210
Sorry.

1131
01:45:39,210 --> 01:45:39,529
Sorry.

1132
01:45:40,390 --> 01:45:41,350
I meant sucker punch.

1133
01:45:44,260 --> 01:45:46,899
Maybe we shouldn't ask.

1134
01:45:46,899 --> 01:45:48,739
Oh, twenty nine damage.

1135
01:45:48,739 --> 01:45:52,699
I'm in so somebody's shooting arrows at my head.

1136
01:45:52,699 --> 01:45:55,720
Oh, it's you.

1137
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:57,479
Jerma went out was playing Metroid earlier.

1138
01:45:57,479 --> 01:46:02,390
I got the morph ball and I said I got the mouthball.

1139
01:46:02,390 --> 01:46:03,109
Oh, nice.

1140
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:05,319
All right.

1141
01:46:05,319 --> 01:46:09,399
The garlic is coming and coming into your your brain here.

1142
01:46:09,399 --> 01:46:14,810
I see a skeleton.

1143
01:46:14,810 --> 01:46:16,970
I joined the party now.

1144
01:46:16,970 --> 01:46:18,090
Oh, hey, everyone.

1145
01:46:18,090 --> 01:46:18,810
No, no, no, no, no.

1146
01:46:18,810 --> 01:46:19,449
We we good.

1147
01:46:19,449 --> 01:46:19,930
We good.

1148
01:46:19,930 --> 01:46:20,569
We cool.

1149
01:46:20,569 --> 01:46:20,970
No, no, no.

1150
01:46:20,970 --> 01:46:21,770
Don't do don't do that.

1151
01:46:21,770 --> 01:46:22,729
We'll still forgive you.

1152
01:46:22,729 --> 01:46:23,449
We'll still forgive you.

1153
01:46:23,449 --> 01:46:23,949
It's fine.

1154
01:46:24,649 --> 01:46:24,970
All right.

1155
01:46:24,970 --> 01:46:25,289
Kill him.

1156
01:46:25,289 --> 01:46:25,609
Kill him.

1157
01:46:25,609 --> 01:46:28,260
He's killing us.

1158
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:30,180
I'm I'm fumbling the controls.

1159
01:46:30,180 --> 01:46:30,979
I fumbled.

1160
01:46:30,979 --> 01:46:32,500
Please do not let me fumble further.

1161
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:36,789
How many fuck I'm dead.

1162
01:46:36,789 --> 01:46:39,930
I've accomplished nothing.

1163
01:46:43,539 --> 01:46:44,659
I didn't do my heel either.

1164
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:46,810
I got him.

1165
01:46:46,810 --> 01:46:47,930
Wait, what do you mean you got him?

1166
01:46:47,930 --> 01:46:48,430
He's down.

1167
01:46:49,670 --> 01:46:50,949
Like all of them.

1168
01:46:50,949 --> 01:46:51,909
There's one guy.

1169
01:46:51,909 --> 01:46:52,869
I don't know.

1170
01:46:52,869 --> 01:46:54,710
There's literally one guy.

1171
01:46:54,710 --> 01:46:55,750
Jerma, did you kill one?

1172
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:56,390
I killed one.

1173
01:46:56,390 --> 01:46:56,890
Yeah.

1174
01:46:58,579 --> 01:47:00,500
Oh, well, I ran away like a coward.

1175
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:02,819
I thought they were friendly at first because he was making sounds.

1176
01:47:02,819 --> 01:47:08,149
But when you were like, we're friendly and he was like, I was like, oh, okay.

1177
01:47:08,149 --> 01:47:10,229
But that was him grunting while he was swinging at us.

1178
01:47:11,109 --> 01:47:12,470
Yes, not friendly sounds.

1179
01:47:12,470 --> 01:47:12,970
Yeah.

1180
01:47:14,039 --> 01:47:16,199
I have your heart so we can.

1181
01:47:16,199 --> 01:47:18,310
It's a weird thing to say, but it's true.

1182
01:47:18,869 --> 01:47:20,710
I can just we can revive you.

1183
01:47:20,710 --> 01:47:24,659
We can revive you is what I'm trying to say.

1184
01:47:24,659 --> 01:47:25,460
Oh, yeah.

1185
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:26,659
No, I didn't have it.

1186
01:47:26,659 --> 01:47:29,060
I had literally just absolute dog shit on.

1187
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:33,220
I had like a I think I had a green helmet on and that was it.

1188
01:47:33,220 --> 01:47:33,779
Okay.

1189
01:47:33,779 --> 01:47:34,500
Well, I got that.

1190
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:38,010
So we'll try to find you and get you back.

1191
01:47:38,010 --> 01:47:41,270
Cool gaming.

1192
01:47:41,270 --> 01:47:44,470
People are saying that that was just the barbarian sound effects.

1193
01:47:45,270 --> 01:47:46,229
Was it?

1194
01:47:46,229 --> 01:47:49,829
No, he was clearly going like over the voice chat, wasn't it?

1195
01:47:49,829 --> 01:47:50,899
I don't know.

1196
01:47:50,899 --> 01:47:52,260
No, that sounded like in-game.

1197
01:47:52,739 --> 01:47:58,869
The guy did not run at you in real life going.

1198
01:47:59,989 --> 01:48:03,350
I thought he was being like funny over the voice comms.

1199
01:48:03,350 --> 01:48:06,390
I don't think they're funny.

1200
01:48:06,390 --> 01:48:07,670
I'm going to head down this way.

1201
01:48:08,630 --> 01:48:11,989
We can get out of the circle and try to find a shrine of resurrection.

1202
01:48:11,989 --> 01:48:12,630
He was.

1203
01:48:12,630 --> 01:48:14,819
Yeah, no, he definitely was.

1204
01:48:14,819 --> 01:48:16,310
Careful.

1205
01:48:16,310 --> 01:48:17,029
Don't stand up.

1206
01:48:17,029 --> 01:48:17,670
Whatever you do.

1207
01:48:18,470 --> 01:48:20,279
I won't.

1208
01:48:20,279 --> 01:48:20,920
Okay.

1209
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:25,420
My main strategy is letting you go first.

1210
01:48:25,420 --> 01:48:26,760
That's a good one.

1211
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:27,479
Wait, I'm an archer.

1212
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:29,399
That doesn't check out.

1213
01:48:31,750 --> 01:48:32,710
We got skeleton here.

1214
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:35,350
Someone might be behind us.

1215
01:48:35,350 --> 01:48:36,470
Can you stop turning those off?

1216
01:48:37,670 --> 01:48:42,300
I'm trying to watch my TV show of you guys playing and it's dark now.

1217
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:49,850
And darker.

1218
01:48:49,850 --> 01:48:51,689
Invisibility potion.

1219
01:48:51,689 --> 01:48:53,079
Those are okay.

1220
01:48:53,079 --> 01:49:03,670
You can't really attack when you have them, but good to get out of a shitty situation.

1221
01:49:03,670 --> 01:49:05,590
Oh, good luck.

1222
01:49:05,590 --> 01:49:07,670
Yeah, you're not going to kill that dude.

1223
01:49:08,470 --> 01:49:09,739
Careful, sir.

1224
01:49:09,739 --> 01:49:11,500
There's another fucking spike in the wall.

1225
01:49:12,380 --> 01:49:15,420
That Wraith will kill you both in like one hit.

1226
01:49:17,140 --> 01:49:17,460
Yes, sir.

1227
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:22,470
There's like random hard, I guess in quotes, enemies.

1228
01:49:22,470 --> 01:49:24,310
Like I said, I'm pretty familiar with the gameplay.

1229
01:49:24,310 --> 01:49:27,989
So I've seen Wraiths and stuff.

1230
01:49:27,989 --> 01:49:29,109
Did you loot this guy?

1231
01:49:30,470 --> 01:49:34,890
I kind of didn't want to because there was a Wraith.

1232
01:49:34,890 --> 01:49:39,909
I felt like maybe, maybe not.

1233
01:49:39,909 --> 01:49:41,880
Oh, they had some gold.

1234
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:42,920
I took a little bit of their gold.

1235
01:49:45,060 --> 01:49:46,180
I took their pants.

1236
01:49:46,180 --> 01:49:55,829
This is a treasure chest here.

1237
01:49:55,829 --> 01:49:57,430
You know, I do have a campfire kit.

1238
01:49:57,430 --> 01:50:02,420
If we find a nice quiet area, I can, we can recover all of our health.

1239
01:50:02,420 --> 01:50:05,460
Yeah, you absolutely should, especially because you guys are two now.

1240
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:09,880
You're going to, if you go to, there's a group of three that have half health

1241
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:12,199
versus, you know, you have full health.

1242
01:50:14,859 --> 01:50:16,140
I'm hearing a lot of footsteps.

1243
01:50:16,140 --> 01:50:17,659
I'm trying, like, I get that.

1244
01:50:17,659 --> 01:50:19,100
It's like you're doing like a stream.

1245
01:50:19,739 --> 01:50:21,739
You're trying to like talk to your friends and shit.

1246
01:50:22,460 --> 01:50:24,300
There's definitely people that way.

1247
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:26,949
There's a mummy.

1248
01:50:26,949 --> 01:50:28,619
Oh, red mummy.

1249
01:50:29,260 --> 01:50:42,600
Pretty good with that right here.

1250
01:50:44,439 --> 01:50:46,250
Ow.

1251
01:50:46,250 --> 01:50:49,899
Yeah, we got to, we desperately got to heal up here.

1252
01:50:49,899 --> 01:50:50,859
Stir, you know what?

1253
01:50:50,859 --> 01:50:51,899
You just can't fire down here.

1254
01:50:51,899 --> 01:50:53,100
I don't think anyone's going to use it.

1255
01:50:53,100 --> 01:50:53,739
I'm going to use it here.

1256
01:50:53,739 --> 01:50:53,899
Yeah.

1257
01:50:53,899 --> 01:50:54,779
I'm going to use it here.

1258
01:50:54,779 --> 01:50:59,850
Just do me a favor, stir.

1259
01:50:59,850 --> 01:51:02,409
When you get in here, crouch.

1260
01:51:02,409 --> 01:51:06,520
Don't stand up and also put up the light.

1261
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:06,920
Maybe.

1262
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:07,640
All right.

1263
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:07,880
Okay.

1264
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:08,840
Get in here before.

1265
01:51:08,840 --> 01:51:11,619
Okay.

1266
01:51:11,619 --> 01:51:13,140
How much does the campfire heal?

1267
01:51:13,140 --> 01:51:15,539
I know it does refresh on spells too, right?

1268
01:51:15,539 --> 01:51:17,779
I'm not sure about this.

1269
01:51:17,779 --> 01:51:18,020
Yeah.

1270
01:51:18,020 --> 01:51:24,789
I haven't used it as a wizard yet, but it looks like it's healing a decent amount

1271
01:51:24,789 --> 01:51:26,710
for as long as you're in front of it.

1272
01:51:26,710 --> 01:51:28,869
It's like full health for me from now.

1273
01:51:30,550 --> 01:51:31,109
Close.

1274
01:51:31,109 --> 01:51:33,050
40, 50 percent.

1275
01:51:33,050 --> 01:51:39,989
I'd say it was like 65, 70 percent.

1276
01:51:39,989 --> 01:51:42,869
It refreshes most skills, not only wizard.

1277
01:51:42,869 --> 01:51:45,020
That's actually a huge deal.

1278
01:51:45,020 --> 01:51:48,380
Especially if you have one that gets consumed, like the fighter of heal.

1279
01:51:48,380 --> 01:51:49,180
That's a big deal.

1280
01:51:49,180 --> 01:51:51,979
Hey, we got a little secret tunnel down here.

1281
01:51:51,979 --> 01:51:52,460
Yeah.

1282
01:51:52,460 --> 01:51:59,369
Oh, okay, cool.

1283
01:51:59,369 --> 01:52:01,210
I think there's an escape.

1284
01:52:01,210 --> 01:52:02,010
No, that's a wraith.

1285
01:52:02,010 --> 01:52:03,529
He's glowing the same blue.

1286
01:52:05,939 --> 01:52:07,380
Now an escape just appeared.

1287
01:52:07,380 --> 01:52:09,220
There's a guy behind us from the way we came.

1288
01:52:09,220 --> 01:52:10,710
That's so scary.

1289
01:52:11,430 --> 01:52:13,430
That is like terrifying looking.

1290
01:52:14,789 --> 01:52:15,350
That's a rogue.

1291
01:52:15,350 --> 01:52:16,229
You want to take this?

1292
01:52:16,229 --> 01:52:17,189
Is that a rogue or a mage?

1293
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:20,739
You take it.

1294
01:52:20,739 --> 01:52:21,220
You sure?

1295
01:52:21,779 --> 01:52:22,789
Yeah.

1296
01:52:22,789 --> 01:52:25,029
All right.

1297
01:52:25,029 --> 01:52:25,670
All right.

1298
01:52:25,670 --> 01:52:27,350
Nice job.

1299
01:52:27,350 --> 01:52:27,829
All right.

1300
01:52:27,829 --> 01:52:28,630
Good luck, sir.

1301
01:52:28,630 --> 01:52:32,119
Looks like a whole party.

1302
01:52:32,119 --> 01:52:32,600
Oh, man.

1303
01:52:32,600 --> 01:52:32,840
Yeah.

1304
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:36,579
Just stay in this.

1305
01:52:36,579 --> 01:52:37,140
Don't bump me.

1306
01:52:41,210 --> 01:52:43,560
Oh, my God.

1307
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:44,039
Oh, yeah.

1308
01:52:44,039 --> 01:52:44,600
They're bumping you.

1309
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:45,399
They're bumping you.

1310
01:52:45,399 --> 01:52:46,939
They might just think it's lag.

1311
01:52:48,100 --> 01:52:50,180
They do like he's like, oh, what was that?

1312
01:52:50,180 --> 01:52:51,060
They just kept going.

1313
01:52:51,699 --> 01:52:53,619
I mean, that's what I would think if I like, why can't I move?

1314
01:52:53,619 --> 01:52:54,340
What's going on?

1315
01:52:54,340 --> 01:52:54,979
That'd be lag.

1316
01:52:55,859 --> 01:52:57,930
You have an invisibility potion too, right?

1317
01:52:59,020 --> 01:53:06,539
Nice smart, smart, smart, smart gaming.

1318
01:53:06,539 --> 01:53:07,979
Oh, you can't move when you do it.

1319
01:53:07,979 --> 01:53:09,100
Oh, that's so lame.

1320
01:53:09,100 --> 01:53:10,460
Oh, that you can't.

1321
01:53:10,460 --> 01:53:13,050
Close the door behind you.

1322
01:53:13,050 --> 01:53:14,810
Yeah, you're in the hell room, sir.

1323
01:53:14,810 --> 01:53:16,649
Pretty much everybody's going to be here in a second.

1324
01:53:16,649 --> 01:53:17,819
Three minutes.

1325
01:53:23,460 --> 01:53:28,199
Oh, it's a perk to do that.

1326
01:53:28,199 --> 01:53:30,359
There's a perk to make it so you can move 10 steps.

1327
01:53:30,359 --> 01:53:31,479
I have that.

1328
01:53:31,479 --> 01:53:32,600
Just just talk to them.

1329
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:33,560
Just just reason with them.

1330
01:53:36,470 --> 01:53:37,909
All right.

1331
01:53:37,909 --> 01:53:38,630
I fucked up.

1332
01:53:38,630 --> 01:53:41,750
I mean, I would have stayed invisible, but I have that perk.

1333
01:53:41,750 --> 01:53:43,670
But it's not my invisibility.

1334
01:53:43,670 --> 01:53:45,909
So I don't know if it would work that way.

1335
01:53:48,939 --> 01:53:50,619
Jerma, I still have some of the stuff.

1336
01:53:50,619 --> 01:53:51,500
I don't know how to.

1337
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:54,439
I don't think I can give it to you in the menu here, but.

1338
01:53:54,439 --> 01:54:01,609
No, no, the only way you can trade is kind of is we would have to both join the trader thing.

1339
01:54:01,609 --> 01:54:05,659
And it's 15 gold to do any transaction, from my understanding.

1340
01:54:05,659 --> 01:54:09,960
Or you have to bring it and drop it, which bringing it and dropping it is a scary thing in its own way.

1341
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:13,239
Oh, no, I was going to have that perk, but then I had to take pickpocket.

1342
01:54:13,239 --> 01:54:15,369
All right.

1343
01:54:15,369 --> 01:54:15,930
You know what?

1344
01:54:15,930 --> 01:54:17,850
It's yeah, you didn't really have anything that great.

1345
01:54:17,850 --> 01:54:18,890
So fuck it.

1346
01:54:20,659 --> 01:54:22,260
All right.

1347
01:54:22,260 --> 01:54:26,659
Yeah, I didn't know that the rogue had a timer on his self either.

1348
01:54:29,079 --> 01:54:31,020
Well, OK.

1349
01:54:31,020 --> 01:54:32,300
Yeah, no, that was fun.

1350
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:38,140
Vinny, if you're still around, I don't know what time frame you guys are both on,

1351
01:54:38,140 --> 01:54:41,739
but I'll be up for like at least another like four or five plus hours playing it.

1352
01:54:41,739 --> 01:54:42,380
Oh, my gosh.

1353
01:54:43,420 --> 01:54:46,619
Yeah, I might play because I streamed the direct and then Metroid Prime.

1354
01:54:46,619 --> 01:54:47,420
I'm getting a little tired.

1355
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:49,819
So I'll tell you what, I'm probably going to play for like another hour.

1356
01:54:49,819 --> 01:54:51,619
But yeah, do your thing.

1357
01:54:51,619 --> 01:54:55,140
I know you have a bunch of people that want to check out the game with Friday, too.

1358
01:54:55,140 --> 01:54:57,859
I was planning on playing this Friday and maybe grabbing a couple of other people.

1359
01:54:57,859 --> 01:54:59,619
So anyone want to play on Friday, too?

1360
01:54:59,619 --> 01:55:00,340
Dang.

1361
01:55:00,340 --> 01:55:01,939
He's going all in.

1362
01:55:01,939 --> 01:55:03,060
Yeah, he's going all in.

1363
01:55:03,060 --> 01:55:04,020
I might be around.

1364
01:55:04,020 --> 01:55:04,739
Just hit me up.

1365
01:55:04,739 --> 01:55:06,180
Yeah, let's see.

1366
01:55:06,180 --> 01:55:06,500
All right.

1367
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:10,460
See who's available in the group was as always good.

1368
01:55:10,460 --> 01:55:11,340
Stir.

1369
01:55:11,340 --> 01:55:13,020
Nice to game with you, gamer.

1370
01:55:13,020 --> 01:55:15,430
Yeah, nice to finally meet you for the first time.

1371
01:55:15,430 --> 01:55:16,229
You too, man.

1372
01:55:16,229 --> 01:55:16,869
I enjoyed this.

1373
01:55:17,670 --> 01:55:18,789
We'll game again sometime.

1374
01:55:18,789 --> 01:55:19,670
See you.

1375
01:55:19,670 --> 01:55:20,149
Yeah.

1376
01:55:20,149 --> 01:55:21,479
Take it easy, Vinny.

1377
01:55:21,479 --> 01:55:21,880
Bye.

1378
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:25,109
Enjoy Metroid.

1379
01:55:25,109 --> 01:55:32,039
That's so funny that it's just like, oh, hey, by the way, it's out today.

1380
01:55:32,039 --> 01:55:33,880
I feel like that's the people are doing that.

1381
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:34,840
Companies are doing that now.

1382
01:55:35,479 --> 01:55:36,840
What did Nintendo do?

1383
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:37,560
What's out today?

1384
01:55:38,649 --> 01:55:42,729
Metroid Prime remaster was announced and came out today.

1385
01:55:42,729 --> 01:55:49,930
OK, so we've got to fill here.

1386
01:55:49,930 --> 01:55:53,460
I'm going to bring in Caleb.

1387
01:55:53,460 --> 01:55:54,340
Oh, I love Caleb.

1388
01:55:56,920 --> 01:56:01,640
Caleb, Caleb's in-game name is fucking crazy.

1389
01:56:03,319 --> 01:56:04,600
I don't even want to type this.

1390
01:56:05,420 --> 01:56:06,649
Who's Caleb?

1391
01:56:06,649 --> 01:56:07,149
Hold on.

1392
01:56:13,460 --> 01:56:15,380
I have to type it, so I'm going to type it.

1393
01:56:15,380 --> 01:56:18,149
Let me get him in here.

1394
01:56:18,149 --> 01:56:26,149
I add some.

1395
01:56:26,149 --> 01:56:35,960
Oh, here we go.

1396
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:36,460
Yo.

1397
01:56:37,210 --> 01:56:39,109
Hello.

1398
01:56:39,109 --> 01:56:40,390
How goes it?

1399
01:56:40,390 --> 01:56:40,869
How are you?

1400
01:56:40,869 --> 01:56:42,310
Can you please introduce yourself?

1401
01:56:42,310 --> 01:56:45,270
Because people have no idea who I'm bringing into the game right now.

1402
01:56:46,970 --> 01:56:49,770
Yeah, my name is Jess Joles, and I'm really nobody.

1403
01:56:49,770 --> 01:56:53,460
But I work for somebody cool.

1404
01:56:53,460 --> 01:56:54,729
And that's why I'm at Germo.

1405
01:56:57,770 --> 01:56:58,729
That's all that matters.

1406
01:56:59,289 --> 01:57:00,489
I work for somebody.

1407
01:57:00,489 --> 01:57:02,489
Well, if everyone's saying who, who, who, who.

1408
01:57:03,609 --> 01:57:06,949
He can't talk about it because it's President Biden.

1409
01:57:06,949 --> 01:57:07,590
Oh, yeah, of course.

1410
01:57:07,590 --> 01:57:09,500
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

1411
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:12,380
We actually invited him to the White House and Secret Service, basically.

1412
01:57:14,300 --> 01:57:15,020
Let me add you.

1413
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:18,779
What's your name again?

1414
01:57:20,220 --> 01:57:20,939
Oh, God.

1415
01:57:24,060 --> 01:57:25,420
Like that, I think.

1416
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:27,319
That's you.

1417
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:31,479
You are awkward.

1418
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:35,000
I don't even know how to.

1419
01:57:35,640 --> 01:57:37,000
We're just going to move on from that.

1420
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,100
Yeah, we're just going to move on.

1421
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:39,500
We're just going to move on.

1422
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:41,260
You are a player, by the way.

1423
01:57:41,260 --> 01:57:42,920
Sterling, he's a player.

1424
01:57:42,920 --> 01:57:43,720
He's a player.

1425
01:57:44,859 --> 01:57:48,779
Okay, just to let you be aware, in case you bring any important items in,

1426
01:57:48,779 --> 01:57:53,100
my main strategy is running away as soon as anything bad happens.

1427
01:57:53,100 --> 01:57:55,979
And if you expect me to help you, I just want you to be aware that

1428
01:57:55,979 --> 01:57:57,819
I'm probably three rooms down.

1429
01:57:57,819 --> 01:57:59,079
Oh, perfect.

1430
01:57:59,399 --> 01:58:00,199
No, that's excellent.

1431
01:58:00,199 --> 01:58:01,800
I actually like getting all the kills.

1432
01:58:02,600 --> 01:58:04,119
He's a new player.

1433
01:58:04,119 --> 01:58:04,680
So am I.

1434
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:06,939
I started literally two days ago.

1435
01:58:06,939 --> 01:58:07,500
Really?

1436
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:07,819
Yeah.

1437
01:58:07,819 --> 01:58:09,100
I think we talked about this in the car.

1438
01:58:09,100 --> 01:58:11,020
I think we talked about this game and how I was like literally

1439
01:58:11,020 --> 01:58:12,699
just ranting and raving about this game.

1440
01:58:12,699 --> 01:58:12,939
Yeah.

1441
01:58:12,939 --> 01:58:13,659
So that's huge.

1442
01:58:15,020 --> 01:58:15,180
All right.

1443
01:58:15,180 --> 01:58:17,659
Let me bring my best gear so I can be sad that I lost it.

1444
01:58:17,659 --> 01:58:19,420
Oh, don't do that.

1445
01:58:19,420 --> 01:58:19,899
No, no, no.

1446
01:58:19,899 --> 01:58:20,859
I only have purples.

1447
01:58:20,859 --> 01:58:21,899
I only have purples.

1448
01:58:21,899 --> 01:58:23,109
What?

1449
01:58:23,109 --> 01:58:23,829
No, calm down.

1450
01:58:23,829 --> 01:58:24,390
Calm down.

1451
01:58:24,390 --> 01:58:24,949
Hold on.

1452
01:58:24,949 --> 01:58:25,590
You have.

1453
01:58:25,590 --> 01:58:25,750
All right.

1454
01:58:25,750 --> 01:58:26,630
We're going to get carried, Sterling.

1455
01:58:26,630 --> 01:58:27,750
This is going to be great.

1456
01:58:27,750 --> 01:58:28,310
No, no, no.

1457
01:58:28,310 --> 01:58:28,949
Calm down.

1458
01:58:28,949 --> 01:58:29,270
Wait, wait.

1459
01:58:29,270 --> 01:58:29,829
You're a ranger.

1460
01:58:29,829 --> 01:58:30,789
Wait, you're a ranger.

1461
01:58:30,789 --> 01:58:31,989
I'm a rogue.

1462
01:58:31,989 --> 01:58:32,789
Oh, my God.

1463
01:58:32,789 --> 01:58:33,590
That's so upsetting.

1464
01:58:33,590 --> 01:58:36,659
I have a purple bow.

1465
01:58:36,659 --> 01:58:37,699
In the car?

1466
01:58:37,699 --> 01:58:38,100
In the car.

1467
01:58:38,100 --> 01:58:39,399
What do you mean in the car?

1468
01:58:39,399 --> 01:58:39,880
When I.

1469
01:58:39,880 --> 01:58:40,359
OK.

1470
01:58:40,359 --> 01:58:45,000
When I was for tummy time, I had to hang out with a lot of really cool people

1471
01:58:46,470 --> 01:58:49,270
and just Jules was one of those people.

1472
01:58:49,270 --> 01:58:51,399
Well, I appreciate that.

1473
01:58:51,399 --> 01:58:52,680
I just happened to be there.

1474
01:58:52,680 --> 01:58:53,640
Right place, right time.

1475
01:58:57,270 --> 01:58:57,590
All right.

1476
01:58:57,590 --> 01:58:58,149
I am.

1477
01:58:58,149 --> 01:58:58,869
I'm good to go.

1478
01:58:58,869 --> 01:59:02,869
I'm geared up.

1479
01:59:02,869 --> 01:59:04,229
Actually, do you have a pendant?

1480
01:59:04,229 --> 01:59:04,710
Yeah.

1481
01:59:04,710 --> 01:59:05,270
Sorry.

1482
01:59:05,270 --> 01:59:05,829
I.

1483
01:59:05,829 --> 01:59:06,069
OK.

1484
01:59:06,149 --> 01:59:11,270
If you maybe I'll bring some some good shit because if you're going to actually

1485
01:59:11,270 --> 01:59:15,829
this is probably going to go pretty well because earlier we were doing some Facebook runs.

1486
01:59:15,829 --> 01:59:19,819
So it's good to have a quam kuzler.

1487
01:59:19,819 --> 01:59:21,100
That's you guys.

1488
01:59:21,100 --> 01:59:21,420
It's French.

1489
01:59:21,420 --> 01:59:21,979
It's French.

1490
01:59:21,979 --> 01:59:22,460
You guys.

1491
01:59:22,460 --> 01:59:25,020
Again, it's quam kuzler.

1492
01:59:25,020 --> 01:59:25,979
You guys are going to get along.

1493
01:59:25,979 --> 01:59:26,460
I already know.

1494
01:59:26,460 --> 01:59:28,569
So we're good.

1495
01:59:28,569 --> 01:59:31,270
It's going to be a family name.

1496
01:59:31,270 --> 01:59:32,550
I'm already fat fingering my all.

1497
01:59:32,550 --> 01:59:33,029
This is good.

1498
01:59:42,140 --> 01:59:43,779
Here we go.

1499
01:59:43,779 --> 01:59:47,239
So you're a barbarian and you I want to inspect you

1500
01:59:47,239 --> 01:59:51,000
because I want to see just how hard we're about to get carried here.

1501
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:55,079
So the beauty about barbarian is once you hit level 15, all you need is a good axe

1502
01:59:55,079 --> 01:59:57,000
and I'll and just no thoughts.

1503
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:58,199
You just hit people in the head.

1504
01:59:58,199 --> 01:59:59,579
That's all you do.

1505
01:59:59,579 --> 02:00:00,810
Come here.

1506
02:00:00,810 --> 02:00:01,689
Where are you?

1507
02:00:01,689 --> 02:00:02,250
I'm right here.

1508
02:00:02,250 --> 02:00:02,729
Can I inspect?

1509
02:00:02,729 --> 02:00:03,850
How do you can I inspect you?

1510
02:00:03,850 --> 02:00:06,359
How do I do that?

1511
02:00:06,359 --> 02:00:06,760
Yep.

1512
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:09,079
I'll turn over and cough.

1513
02:00:09,079 --> 02:00:09,720
OK.

1514
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:10,680
That's a big axe.

1515
02:00:11,500 --> 02:00:12,220
Yep.

1516
02:00:12,220 --> 02:00:12,460
Here.

1517
02:00:12,460 --> 02:00:13,420
I'll drop it for you here.

1518
02:00:13,420 --> 02:00:13,899
You want to see it?

1519
02:00:13,899 --> 02:00:14,300
Oh, my God.

1520
02:00:14,300 --> 02:00:15,420
That's scary.

1521
02:00:15,420 --> 02:00:15,899
Oh, my God.

1522
02:00:15,899 --> 02:00:16,779
This thing's crazy.

1523
02:00:16,779 --> 02:00:17,340
Oh, my God.

1524
02:00:17,340 --> 02:00:18,460
He dropped the axe.

1525
02:00:18,460 --> 02:00:18,859
Whoa.

1526
02:00:18,859 --> 02:00:19,100
OK.

1527
02:00:19,659 --> 02:00:20,619
What if I DC or something?

1528
02:00:21,100 --> 02:00:22,300
That's axe caliber.

1529
02:00:24,149 --> 02:00:25,590
I'll never I'm never speaking it.

1530
02:00:25,590 --> 02:00:26,069
I'm sorry.

1531
02:00:26,069 --> 02:00:27,590
Anyways, check this out.

1532
02:00:27,590 --> 02:00:27,909
Check this.

1533
02:00:27,909 --> 02:00:31,779
So these big screen big scary guys over here, right?

1534
02:00:31,779 --> 02:00:33,859
Also, my interact speed is awful.

1535
02:00:33,859 --> 02:00:35,460
But just watch this.

1536
02:00:35,460 --> 02:00:37,000
Just watch this.

1537
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:37,640
Oh, hello.

1538
02:00:38,859 --> 02:00:44,340
We are essentially going to be and oh, my goodness.

1539
02:00:44,340 --> 02:00:45,140
OK, stir.

1540
02:00:45,140 --> 02:00:48,340
I hope you're ready to just kind of like collect items from people.

1541
02:00:48,340 --> 02:00:50,020
I mean, that's all I've been doing.

1542
02:00:50,020 --> 02:00:53,979
So I feel like this is a good even spread.

1543
02:00:53,979 --> 02:00:55,739
So paid actor.

1544
02:00:56,119 --> 02:00:57,239
Have you guys hit the dummy yet?

1545
02:00:57,239 --> 02:00:59,720
Like with the weapons and you like got your numbers

1546
02:00:59,720 --> 02:01:02,409
like to figure out your damage and all that.

1547
02:01:02,409 --> 02:01:04,659
I haven't gotten any numbers.

1548
02:01:04,659 --> 02:01:08,020
Well, it's kind of hard because the match starts so quickly.

1549
02:01:08,020 --> 02:01:08,500
Oh, yeah.

1550
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:09,380
Oh, I sprint down there.

1551
02:01:09,380 --> 02:01:12,979
I literally pop my rage and I just like run down to the fucking the dummy

1552
02:01:12,979 --> 02:01:15,079
really as like quickly as possible.

1553
02:01:15,079 --> 02:01:21,699
So the average like arming sword does 30 damage and this axe does 160.

1554
02:01:21,699 --> 02:01:22,979
Oh, my God.

1555
02:01:22,979 --> 02:01:23,300
All right.

1556
02:01:23,300 --> 02:01:25,619
So you have two little brothers right now.

1557
02:01:26,180 --> 02:01:27,060
Essentially, what's going on?

1558
02:01:27,460 --> 02:01:28,979
That's always what I've wanted.

1559
02:01:28,979 --> 02:01:30,920
I will be torch guy.

1560
02:01:30,920 --> 02:01:31,239
Yeah.

1561
02:01:31,239 --> 02:01:32,729
Oh, oh, oh, God.

1562
02:01:32,729 --> 02:01:34,010
Yeah, yeah.

1563
02:01:34,970 --> 02:01:36,010
Dead in one hit.

1564
02:01:36,010 --> 02:01:36,810
Oh, my God.

1565
02:01:36,810 --> 02:01:38,010
I come to this nature.

1566
02:01:38,010 --> 02:01:40,810
I feel like this is an advertisement for the game.

1567
02:01:40,810 --> 02:01:41,930
Well, you could do this.

1568
02:01:44,039 --> 02:01:45,239
This is a very different game.

1569
02:01:45,239 --> 02:01:46,760
Archer up top Archer up top.

1570
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:47,260
Mm hmm.

1571
02:01:48,789 --> 02:01:49,510
Uh, what Archer?

1572
02:01:49,510 --> 02:01:50,149
What Archer?

1573
02:01:50,149 --> 02:01:56,659
Should that hurt my bad boys?

1574
02:01:56,659 --> 02:01:58,100
I'll leave some mobs for you all.

1575
02:01:58,100 --> 02:01:58,579
Oh, my God.

1576
02:01:58,579 --> 02:02:00,229
There's skeletons here.

1577
02:02:00,229 --> 02:02:00,550
Help.

1578
02:02:00,550 --> 02:02:03,590
I mean, like, do I have to hit things to level though?

1579
02:02:03,590 --> 02:02:03,909
Yes.

1580
02:02:03,909 --> 02:02:04,229
Yes.

1581
02:02:04,229 --> 02:02:05,670
So I'm going to let I'm going to let you tap them.

1582
02:02:05,909 --> 02:02:07,029
I'm just going to kill them.

1583
02:02:07,029 --> 02:02:08,710
Just give them a little love tap.

1584
02:02:08,710 --> 02:02:09,829
Let me know you're there.

1585
02:02:09,829 --> 02:02:10,149
Yeah.

1586
02:02:10,149 --> 02:02:10,710
Good boys.

1587
02:02:10,710 --> 02:02:12,710
Good actor.

1588
02:02:12,710 --> 02:02:14,149
I got like credit for the kill.

1589
02:02:14,149 --> 02:02:15,109
If you carry me.

1590
02:02:15,670 --> 02:02:16,630
Beautiful boys.

1591
02:02:16,630 --> 02:02:17,350
That was excellent.

1592
02:02:17,989 --> 02:02:19,829
And you have a you have a page on E.

1593
02:02:19,829 --> 02:02:20,310
Oh, my God.

1594
02:02:20,310 --> 02:02:20,630
Crunchy.

1595
02:02:20,630 --> 02:02:21,670
E pal dot com.

1596
02:02:24,149 --> 02:02:26,869
I can buy a purple now, by the way, from that store.

1597
02:02:26,869 --> 02:02:29,779
I have I got two more crunchies.

1598
02:02:29,779 --> 02:02:31,140
A little meta gaming tips.

1599
02:02:31,140 --> 02:02:33,619
So if you find something that you like want to give to your friend,

1600
02:02:33,619 --> 02:02:34,659
don't leave it in the chest.

1601
02:02:34,659 --> 02:02:37,699
Just take it out and drag it out because the interact speed for other

1602
02:02:37,699 --> 02:02:38,659
players is trash.

1603
02:02:38,659 --> 02:02:41,779
Sometimes you actually both probably have rogues have the highest,

1604
02:02:41,779 --> 02:02:43,829
I think, other than Rangers.

1605
02:02:43,829 --> 02:02:46,470
Yeah, I'm Rogan.

1606
02:02:46,470 --> 02:02:52,100
I need boots or gloves or something.

1607
02:02:52,100 --> 02:02:53,699
Oh, excuse me.

1608
02:02:53,699 --> 02:02:54,500
I have a question.

1609
02:02:54,500 --> 02:02:54,819
Boots.

1610
02:02:54,819 --> 02:02:55,859
Do you have boots and gloves?

1611
02:02:56,659 --> 02:02:57,539
How do you get down here?

1612
02:02:58,100 --> 02:02:59,779
I have wondered the same thing.

1613
02:02:59,779 --> 02:03:00,180
Really?

1614
02:03:00,180 --> 02:03:01,619
You said we just know.

1615
02:03:01,619 --> 02:03:03,479
OK, you think I'd know.

1616
02:03:03,479 --> 02:03:05,000
But I actually you know what?

1617
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:06,859
Hold on.

1618
02:03:06,859 --> 02:03:08,380
My senses are tingling.

1619
02:03:08,380 --> 02:03:11,100
I think if there's a lever somewhere.

1620
02:03:11,100 --> 02:03:13,800
Yeah, you can't break it.

1621
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:14,119
I agree.

1622
02:03:14,119 --> 02:03:15,079
You can't like smash her.

1623
02:03:15,159 --> 02:03:17,720
If I had to guess, it's probably this door right here.

1624
02:03:17,720 --> 02:03:18,199
Watch this.

1625
02:03:19,899 --> 02:03:20,699
No shot, bro.

1626
02:03:20,699 --> 02:03:21,659
I'm a fucking wizard.

1627
02:03:21,659 --> 02:03:22,859
There's a gamer behind us.

1628
02:03:24,060 --> 02:03:24,939
Gamer behind us.

1629
02:03:24,939 --> 02:03:25,819
Where I am.

1630
02:03:25,819 --> 02:03:28,180
Can you kill him in one hit?

1631
02:03:28,180 --> 02:03:29,140
He's opening this door.

1632
02:03:29,140 --> 02:03:29,779
I'm invisible.

1633
02:03:30,579 --> 02:03:31,939
Let me let me let me.

1634
02:03:31,939 --> 02:03:32,579
Oh, yeah, you got him.

1635
02:03:32,579 --> 02:03:32,899
You got him.

1636
02:03:32,899 --> 02:03:36,729
You got him.

1637
02:03:36,729 --> 02:03:37,050
Yep.

1638
02:03:37,050 --> 02:03:37,289
Yep.

1639
02:03:37,289 --> 02:03:37,609
Boys.

1640
02:03:37,609 --> 02:03:37,850
Yep.

1641
02:03:37,850 --> 02:03:38,729
I didn't hit him.

1642
02:03:38,729 --> 02:03:39,130
I'm helping.

1643
02:03:39,130 --> 02:03:40,010
I'm helping.

1644
02:03:40,010 --> 02:03:40,329
All right.

1645
02:03:40,329 --> 02:03:40,890
The lights are off.

1646
02:03:40,890 --> 02:03:41,289
I can't see.

1647
02:03:41,289 --> 02:03:41,689
Oh, my God.

1648
02:03:41,689 --> 02:03:42,739
There's a mummy.

1649
02:03:42,739 --> 02:03:44,020
I lit it up.

1650
02:03:44,020 --> 02:03:45,140
I'm lighting it up.

1651
02:03:45,140 --> 02:03:46,260
I don't know how I didn't hit him.

1652
02:03:49,699 --> 02:03:50,739
I'm stunning the mummies.

1653
02:03:55,479 --> 02:03:56,680
That group is still over there, I think.

1654
02:03:57,739 --> 02:03:58,380
100 percent.

1655
02:03:59,640 --> 02:04:00,680
I'm creeping.

1656
02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:03,239
They're looking at us just playing musical chairs with the mummies,

1657
02:04:03,239 --> 02:04:04,840
and they're just like, oh, this is easy.

1658
02:04:05,640 --> 02:04:08,439
They probably saw your axe and probably just went, oh, shit.

1659
02:04:10,539 --> 02:04:11,100
They went.

1660
02:04:11,100 --> 02:04:12,300
Do you know what door they took?

1661
02:04:12,300 --> 02:04:14,380
There's beds in here if you guys want to take a nap.

1662
02:04:14,380 --> 02:04:14,779
Wait, wait.

1663
02:04:14,779 --> 02:04:16,220
I think they did the loop, de loop, and pull.

1664
02:04:16,220 --> 02:04:16,859
I think they went.

1665
02:04:16,859 --> 02:04:17,420
No, they didn't.

1666
02:04:17,420 --> 02:04:20,939
Hold on.

1667
02:04:20,939 --> 02:04:21,819
Friends, are you still there?

1668
02:04:21,819 --> 02:04:22,220
Still there.

1669
02:04:22,220 --> 02:04:22,619
I miss you.

1670
02:04:22,619 --> 02:04:24,470
I miss you.

1671
02:04:24,470 --> 02:04:28,149
I'd say we're just trying to find the portal if you've seen one.

1672
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:30,520
Oh, we're in RP.

1673
02:04:31,720 --> 02:04:40,220
But why does everybody hate that voice?

1674
02:04:40,220 --> 02:04:41,500
It's not Stewie Griffin.

1675
02:04:41,500 --> 02:04:43,659
It's fucking somebody else.

1676
02:04:43,659 --> 02:04:46,359
It's it's like the Stanley parable.

1677
02:04:46,359 --> 02:04:49,960
Now, would either of you happen to have like any healing of anything?

1678
02:04:52,250 --> 02:04:53,850
If not, if not, don't worry about it.

1679
02:04:53,850 --> 02:04:54,569
It's fine.

1680
02:04:54,569 --> 02:04:56,729
No, I couldn't possibly need it.

1681
02:04:56,729 --> 02:04:58,329
I could possibly take it.

1682
02:04:58,329 --> 02:04:59,609
I got this full diapy.

1683
02:04:59,609 --> 02:05:08,380
Why?

1684
02:05:09,500 --> 02:05:09,979
There's not.

1685
02:05:09,979 --> 02:05:11,819
OK, let me just go over a few things.

1686
02:05:11,819 --> 02:05:16,460
There's not a single solitary reason for you to have said that right now for any reason.

1687
02:05:18,300 --> 02:05:20,939
There's not a single reason to say what you just said.

1688
02:05:22,300 --> 02:05:26,199
No, he was asking what we had.

1689
02:05:26,199 --> 02:05:31,939
So you have shit into a full you've shit into a diaper to fill it up is what you're telling us.

1690
02:05:32,579 --> 02:05:34,329
That's all you have.

1691
02:05:34,329 --> 02:05:35,289
It's loaded.

1692
02:05:35,289 --> 02:05:36,010
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1693
02:05:36,010 --> 02:05:36,569
Oh, my God.

1694
02:05:36,569 --> 02:05:37,449
There's healing right here.

1695
02:05:37,449 --> 02:05:38,250
Oh, my God.

1696
02:05:38,250 --> 02:05:39,210
Praise the heavens.

1697
02:05:39,210 --> 02:05:39,529
Nice.

1698
02:05:41,779 --> 02:05:42,819
And I just said it out.

1699
02:05:42,819 --> 02:05:43,619
You've ruined everything.

1700
02:05:46,630 --> 02:05:47,590
I'm sorry.

1701
02:05:47,590 --> 02:05:48,149
I'm dumb.

1702
02:05:48,149 --> 02:05:48,630
No, no, no, no.

1703
02:05:48,630 --> 02:05:50,789
Intelligence intelligence is six.

1704
02:05:50,789 --> 02:05:51,590
It's six.

1705
02:05:51,590 --> 02:05:52,069
Not you.

1706
02:05:52,069 --> 02:05:53,270
I'm talking about creepo, man.

1707
02:05:54,069 --> 02:05:55,500
Oh, there's a man.

1708
02:05:55,500 --> 02:05:56,699
There's a guy fighting spiders in there.

1709
02:05:56,699 --> 02:05:57,100
All right.

1710
02:05:57,100 --> 02:05:57,979
What about two people?

1711
02:06:01,590 --> 02:06:03,109
Hey, it's your last day on this planet.

1712
02:06:06,819 --> 02:06:11,479
Oh, my God.

1713
02:06:12,039 --> 02:06:15,800
I was a part of that.

1714
02:06:18,060 --> 02:06:18,619
No, you were.

1715
02:06:18,619 --> 02:06:19,739
You were an accessory.

1716
02:06:19,739 --> 02:06:23,500
If we all get charged for murder, it's all equally on us.

1717
02:06:23,500 --> 02:06:26,220
Yeah.

1718
02:06:26,220 --> 02:06:27,899
Oh, there's a suiander, too.

1719
02:06:27,899 --> 02:06:28,380
That was it.

1720
02:06:28,380 --> 02:06:29,100
Oh, boys, boys.

1721
02:06:29,100 --> 02:06:30,220
You're making mistakes.

1722
02:06:30,220 --> 02:06:30,539
All right.

1723
02:06:30,539 --> 02:06:30,939
Look at this.

1724
02:06:30,939 --> 02:06:31,500
Look at this.

1725
02:06:31,500 --> 02:06:32,300
Look at this, man.

1726
02:06:32,300 --> 02:06:33,340
Everybody inspect the rogue.

1727
02:06:35,930 --> 02:06:37,369
On this rogue was a ring.

1728
02:06:37,369 --> 02:06:37,770
OK.

1729
02:06:37,770 --> 02:06:38,810
You guys missed it.

1730
02:06:38,810 --> 02:06:40,649
This is a this is a common mistake.

1731
02:06:40,649 --> 02:06:42,010
Oh, demonize over here.

1732
02:06:42,010 --> 02:06:42,409
Yeah.

1733
02:06:42,409 --> 02:06:43,529
Don't miss rings.

1734
02:06:43,529 --> 02:06:44,329
Oh, my God.

1735
02:06:44,329 --> 02:06:45,609
And a necklace and a necklace.

1736
02:06:45,609 --> 02:06:46,010
Oh, my God.

1737
02:06:46,010 --> 02:06:48,520
This is an awful day.

1738
02:06:48,520 --> 02:06:50,569
Oh, happens.

1739
02:06:50,569 --> 02:06:51,850
Happens to the best of us.

1740
02:06:51,850 --> 02:06:53,619
I'm going to put on this suiander.

1741
02:06:54,789 --> 02:06:57,750
I mean, I said the typey thing, but I think suiander is worse.

1742
02:06:57,750 --> 02:06:58,789
So zwei handers.

1743
02:06:58,789 --> 02:07:00,229
Like, if you right click it, right click.

1744
02:07:01,270 --> 02:07:02,149
Not close to anybody.

1745
02:07:02,149 --> 02:07:02,550
Jesus.

1746
02:07:02,550 --> 02:07:03,050
What?

1747
02:07:05,430 --> 02:07:07,270
You literally helicopter around.

1748
02:07:07,270 --> 02:07:08,390
Oh, please, please, God.

1749
02:07:08,390 --> 02:07:08,869
No, please.

1750
02:07:09,430 --> 02:07:09,989
I don't know.

1751
02:07:09,989 --> 02:07:11,029
I just don't know.

1752
02:07:11,029 --> 02:07:11,510
Please.

1753
02:07:11,510 --> 02:07:12,069
I'm not going to do.

1754
02:07:12,630 --> 02:07:15,909
I'm not going to kill you as a joke.

1755
02:07:15,909 --> 02:07:17,989
No, I just I mean, you would.

1756
02:07:18,149 --> 02:07:21,579
But I not when you're decked out in purples.

1757
02:07:21,579 --> 02:07:25,819
If you have all these purples, there's no way I kill you for a joke.

1758
02:07:25,819 --> 02:07:29,500
I literally have on a gray armor and just this purple axe.

1759
02:07:29,500 --> 02:07:30,939
That's the barbed life.

1760
02:07:30,939 --> 02:07:32,699
That's the that's the whole thing right there.

1761
02:07:33,260 --> 02:07:33,739
Oh, my God.

1762
02:07:33,739 --> 02:07:34,539
A potion.

1763
02:07:34,539 --> 02:07:35,579
Oh, beautiful.

1764
02:07:35,579 --> 02:07:42,680
So you guys.

1765
02:07:44,550 --> 02:07:47,750
What if you say that like it's your last day on earth and then they kill you?

1766
02:07:48,729 --> 02:07:49,529
That doesn't happen.

1767
02:07:49,529 --> 02:07:52,649
That's never happened in my entire streaming career ever.

1768
02:07:53,449 --> 02:07:55,050
What if it does that?

1769
02:07:55,050 --> 02:07:57,210
I was thinking it's like what if he just gets like headshot by an arrow?

1770
02:07:58,260 --> 02:08:01,220
I have absolutely talked mad trash and gotten stopped before.

1771
02:08:01,220 --> 02:08:02,260
It's very upsetting.

1772
02:08:02,260 --> 02:08:03,939
I got a surgical kit.

1773
02:08:03,939 --> 02:08:04,819
All right, let's go.

1774
02:08:04,819 --> 02:08:07,960
Oh, you should take that.

1775
02:08:07,960 --> 02:08:11,590
Oh, where where where's that surgical kit?

1776
02:08:11,590 --> 02:08:13,510
Well, where I I'm holding it.

1777
02:08:13,510 --> 02:08:15,189
I don't want you to have it.

1778
02:08:15,189 --> 02:08:16,890
Let's go.

1779
02:08:16,890 --> 02:08:18,949
Beautiful.

1780
02:08:18,949 --> 02:08:20,789
I feel like you're already strong enough.

1781
02:08:20,789 --> 02:08:23,029
Like you really need to heal.

1782
02:08:24,260 --> 02:08:26,899
Well, if another barb hits me in the head, I'm definitely dead.

1783
02:08:26,899 --> 02:08:33,340
But, you know, honestly, I do get increased strength with lower lower strength.

1784
02:08:33,340 --> 02:08:34,220
Oh, sorry.

1785
02:08:34,220 --> 02:08:34,779
Lower health.

1786
02:08:34,779 --> 02:08:38,539
So if you do die, we need to we need to make sure we get that axe then.

1787
02:08:38,539 --> 02:08:39,100
Right?

1788
02:08:39,100 --> 02:08:40,060
No, no, no, no, no.

1789
02:08:40,060 --> 02:08:41,500
It's it's fine.

1790
02:08:41,500 --> 02:08:41,979
It's fine.

1791
02:08:41,979 --> 02:08:43,340
I'll I'll just cry about it.

1792
02:08:44,060 --> 02:08:46,840
I mean, that sounds cool.

1793
02:08:48,579 --> 02:08:50,180
Stir is such a Chad.

1794
02:08:50,180 --> 02:08:52,279
Somebody said that about Easter.

1795
02:08:52,279 --> 02:08:52,600
I don't know.

1796
02:08:52,600 --> 02:08:53,079
They just said it.

1797
02:08:53,880 --> 02:08:54,279
Okay.

1798
02:08:54,279 --> 02:08:57,800
Well, thank you for reading that comment instead of like the one guy who probably said

1799
02:08:57,800 --> 02:08:58,520
something negative.

1800
02:09:00,119 --> 02:09:01,399
It's a big moment.

1801
02:09:01,399 --> 02:09:02,520
Negative chats don't exist.

1802
02:09:02,520 --> 02:09:03,880
We just don't we just don't read those.

1803
02:09:06,170 --> 02:09:07,529
There's red portals over here.

1804
02:09:08,729 --> 02:09:10,729
Oh, those are those are evil.

1805
02:09:10,729 --> 02:09:11,130
I know.

1806
02:09:11,130 --> 02:09:14,329
But like I feel like you have a one shot kill axe.

1807
02:09:14,329 --> 02:09:17,050
I if you're scared of the red portal, I'm scared of the red portal.

1808
02:09:17,050 --> 02:09:17,449
I am.

1809
02:09:17,449 --> 02:09:19,210
I am indeed scared of the red portal.

1810
02:09:19,210 --> 02:09:20,250
I am a big.

1811
02:09:20,250 --> 02:09:20,970
I mean, I'll go.

1812
02:09:20,970 --> 02:09:21,529
I'll go.

1813
02:09:21,529 --> 02:09:26,039
But I mean, I mean, I've been I've been I've done it.

1814
02:09:26,039 --> 02:09:29,960
You know, I think it would be you versus the dungeon and we would just be running behind

1815
02:09:29,960 --> 02:09:31,779
you picking up things.

1816
02:09:31,779 --> 02:09:33,140
I think so.

1817
02:09:33,140 --> 02:09:36,739
What I would do is if I was going to go red dungeon, we would all have to be clerics and

1818
02:09:36,739 --> 02:09:40,100
we would just spam the heal spells to kill everything and then bring a bunch of camp

1819
02:09:40,100 --> 02:09:40,420
fires.

1820
02:09:40,420 --> 02:09:40,979
That's my met.

1821
02:09:40,979 --> 02:09:44,359
Oh, there's a blue portal if anybody wanted to guarantee their loot.

1822
02:09:47,420 --> 02:09:53,340
Did you I get hit by these all the time, too.

1823
02:09:53,340 --> 02:09:53,899
All right.

1824
02:09:53,899 --> 02:09:55,699
Are you guys looking for action?

1825
02:09:55,699 --> 02:09:56,420
You guys looking for loot?

1826
02:09:56,420 --> 02:09:57,300
What's the deal here?

1827
02:09:57,300 --> 02:10:00,899
I think I'd like to I have two crunchies and it lets me buy a purple.

1828
02:10:00,899 --> 02:10:02,340
So I and thanks for leaving.

1829
02:10:02,340 --> 02:10:03,140
I was good.

1830
02:10:03,140 --> 02:10:04,899
What do you have on you, sir?

1831
02:10:04,899 --> 02:10:05,699
A surgical kit.

1832
02:10:06,260 --> 02:10:07,140
There's a blue right there.

1833
02:10:07,140 --> 02:10:09,699
I have that three current three countries.

1834
02:10:09,699 --> 02:10:10,659
Oh, my God.

1835
02:10:10,659 --> 02:10:14,039
Oh, you're going to die to this right there.

1836
02:10:14,039 --> 02:10:15,880
I almost got you hit the axe again.

1837
02:10:15,880 --> 02:10:19,670
Yeah, I just do you right now.

1838
02:10:19,670 --> 02:10:21,590
I would say that would be kind of funny, but I hope you don't.

1839
02:10:24,180 --> 02:10:24,579
All right.

1840
02:10:24,579 --> 02:10:25,779
Yes, I got two crunchies.

1841
02:10:26,579 --> 02:10:28,760
So now what are you going to do?

1842
02:10:28,760 --> 02:10:31,350
Are you just let's watch?

1843
02:10:32,229 --> 02:10:34,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1844
02:10:34,020 --> 02:10:36,739
Observe, observe not hitting these axes.

1845
02:10:36,739 --> 02:10:41,989
Watch this one, two, three feet like that every time.

1846
02:10:41,989 --> 02:10:44,489
How does he do it?

1847
02:10:44,489 --> 02:10:45,050
I don't know.

1848
02:10:45,050 --> 02:10:48,020
But there's four people, there's three people, four people.

1849
02:10:48,020 --> 02:10:50,100
And I think you are the one versus three, maybe.

1850
02:10:50,100 --> 02:10:52,600
Wait, I hear.

1851
02:10:54,310 --> 02:10:55,340
Hold on.

1852
02:10:55,340 --> 02:10:58,090
These boxes are in my way.

1853
02:10:58,090 --> 02:10:58,890
Pesky boxes.

1854
02:11:02,140 --> 02:11:02,460
Hmm.

1855
02:11:08,470 --> 02:11:10,149
Does that look funny in third person?

1856
02:11:10,149 --> 02:11:11,670
Yes, it kind of does.

1857
02:11:11,670 --> 02:11:12,380
Do you?

1858
02:11:12,380 --> 02:11:12,619
All right.

1859
02:11:12,619 --> 02:11:15,340
So there are three people left.

1860
02:11:15,340 --> 02:11:16,699
Are you one of them?

1861
02:11:16,699 --> 02:11:18,220
Like on the little indicator over there?

1862
02:11:19,109 --> 02:11:19,350
Yes.

1863
02:11:19,989 --> 02:11:21,270
OK, so good luck.

1864
02:11:21,270 --> 02:11:22,710
Where is the indicator?

1865
02:11:22,710 --> 02:11:23,989
We are getting out.

1866
02:11:23,989 --> 02:11:29,590
Above the map, all the filled in little columns or whatever,

1867
02:11:29,590 --> 02:11:30,470
those are people that are dead.

1868
02:11:32,069 --> 02:11:33,029
So you are the only one.

1869
02:11:33,029 --> 02:11:34,779
Somebody just died.

1870
02:11:34,779 --> 02:11:35,279
Let's go.

1871
02:11:35,979 --> 02:11:36,699
Nuts.

1872
02:11:36,699 --> 02:11:37,500
Awesome.

1873
02:11:37,500 --> 02:11:38,300
That's a dub, boys.

1874
02:11:39,100 --> 02:11:39,899
I'll take it.

1875
02:11:39,899 --> 02:11:41,939
So OK, very important.

1876
02:11:43,060 --> 02:11:46,420
I have 25 of those like Valentine's crunchies.

1877
02:11:46,420 --> 02:11:46,920
Yeah.

1878
02:11:48,729 --> 02:11:54,729
This is a big decision because I think I can afford to buy something crazy.

1879
02:11:54,729 --> 02:11:58,520
Yeah, so that's how I got this axe.

1880
02:11:58,520 --> 02:12:03,180
And I'll tell you, it was both the best and worst purchase of my life.

1881
02:12:03,180 --> 02:12:04,819
Why is that?

1882
02:12:04,819 --> 02:12:06,979
You know, like the gear hoarding syndrome,

1883
02:12:06,979 --> 02:12:09,859
like you get a bunch of gear, you just never use it because it's too nice.

1884
02:12:09,859 --> 02:12:10,899
It just sits in your stash.

1885
02:12:10,899 --> 02:12:12,260
Yeah, that's what I plan on doing.

1886
02:12:13,350 --> 02:12:15,590
Don't do that because we only have a week, but we have less than that now.

1887
02:12:15,590 --> 02:12:16,149
So.

1888
02:12:16,149 --> 02:12:20,329
Oh, but what if I'm going to lose it immediately?

1889
02:12:20,329 --> 02:12:20,890
I would buy this.

1890
02:12:20,890 --> 02:12:21,770
I'm going to make it back.

1891
02:12:21,770 --> 02:12:23,180
I'm going to make it back.

1892
02:12:23,180 --> 02:12:23,819
Don't be silly.

1893
02:12:23,819 --> 02:12:24,619
What should I get?

1894
02:12:24,619 --> 02:12:25,989
Treat yourself.

1895
02:12:25,989 --> 02:12:26,869
Well, what's in your merch?

1896
02:12:29,659 --> 02:12:31,659
Arming sword, which is too magic.

1897
02:12:31,659 --> 02:12:34,489
OK, so does magic damage work?

1898
02:12:34,489 --> 02:12:35,210
Not for you.

1899
02:12:35,210 --> 02:12:40,199
But that this is this is just this is dumb.

1900
02:12:40,199 --> 02:12:40,920
Um, let me see.

1901
02:12:40,920 --> 02:12:41,640
Let me see.

1902
02:12:41,640 --> 02:12:42,600
So you have arming sword.

1903
02:12:42,600 --> 02:12:45,560
You have a halberd is the halberd 30 or.

1904
02:12:45,560 --> 02:12:47,420
That's 30.

1905
02:12:47,420 --> 02:12:48,380
Have you tried the halberd?

1906
02:12:48,380 --> 02:12:49,260
I'm a fan.

1907
02:12:49,260 --> 02:12:50,619
Some people are not, though.

1908
02:12:50,619 --> 02:12:53,590
I prefer the one handers.

1909
02:12:53,590 --> 02:12:54,229
I see, I see.

1910
02:12:54,229 --> 02:12:56,619
I wish I get the mace.

1911
02:12:56,619 --> 02:13:00,729
Yeah, maces high key trash a lot of the times, in my opinion.

1912
02:13:00,729 --> 02:13:02,500
Well, what about like a hmm.

1913
02:13:02,500 --> 02:13:04,260
Yeah, but does this change?

1914
02:13:04,260 --> 02:13:06,090
Well, this will change in eight hours.

1915
02:13:06,569 --> 02:13:07,850
Yeah, it'll change.

1916
02:13:07,850 --> 02:13:10,729
Actually, you know what you can do, and this is this is meta gaming,

1917
02:13:10,729 --> 02:13:13,210
but I can check my merchant, too, and you can trade me the candies

1918
02:13:13,210 --> 02:13:15,050
and I can get you something and I can trade it back.

1919
02:13:15,609 --> 02:13:16,409
That's meta gaming.

1920
02:13:16,409 --> 02:13:17,369
I never mentioned that.

1921
02:13:17,369 --> 02:13:18,250
But let me check for you.

1922
02:13:18,250 --> 02:13:19,449
That's a really cool idea.

1923
02:13:19,449 --> 02:13:22,949
But this whole thing has been for you to take these and then leave the call.

1924
02:13:22,949 --> 02:13:25,109
Um, that's how that that sounded.

1925
02:13:25,109 --> 02:13:27,029
That sounded like an elaborate scam.

1926
02:13:27,029 --> 02:13:28,229
I would never see.

1927
02:13:28,229 --> 02:13:28,869
I'll take them.

1928
02:13:28,869 --> 02:13:29,350
I'll take them.

1929
02:13:29,350 --> 02:13:31,109
I'll go spend it and like I'll bring it back.

1930
02:13:31,109 --> 02:13:33,670
And then you just unfriend me on Discord and you leave.

1931
02:13:33,670 --> 02:13:35,260
And I never heard it ever again.

1932
02:13:35,260 --> 02:13:39,979
It's wild that I have this like purple rapier here with plus one physical damage,

1933
02:13:39,979 --> 02:13:42,699
plus one additional physical damage and plus one strength.

1934
02:13:42,699 --> 02:13:45,930
I would never do such a thing.

1935
02:13:45,930 --> 02:13:49,739
Um, I think I'll hold it because I want to I probably want to see what else is

1936
02:13:49,739 --> 02:13:51,659
because I like the one hander.

1937
02:13:51,659 --> 02:13:53,579
I don't I'm not like a rapier fan.

1938
02:13:53,579 --> 02:13:55,020
That's like you like poke, right?

1939
02:13:55,020 --> 02:13:56,659
It's like stab in front.

1940
02:13:56,659 --> 02:13:58,579
It's like some finesse.

1941
02:13:58,579 --> 02:14:00,100
It's got some finesse to it.

1942
02:14:00,100 --> 02:14:02,100
It's all it's more than poking, I'd say.

1943
02:14:02,100 --> 02:14:08,630
Sir, do you think I should do it or not?

1944
02:14:08,630 --> 02:14:10,789
Hey, he's always gone.

1945
02:14:11,510 --> 02:14:15,800
Uh, what what I was uh, I was getting a diapy change.

1946
02:14:15,800 --> 02:14:18,439
I think the powder god, you are killing me.

1947
02:14:19,430 --> 02:14:23,699
What are we going?

1948
02:14:23,699 --> 02:14:25,779
Wait, what's what's in your what's in your store?

1949
02:14:25,779 --> 02:14:26,659
What's in your valentine's?

1950
02:14:26,659 --> 02:14:28,020
What were you asking me?

1951
02:14:28,020 --> 02:14:29,220
Why did you need my attention?

1952
02:14:30,180 --> 02:14:32,260
He was asking you if you should if you should trust me.

1953
02:14:32,260 --> 02:14:34,739
Then you were you're out there doing adult things.

1954
02:14:34,739 --> 02:14:38,010
I don't in my store.

1955
02:14:38,010 --> 02:14:39,050
I'm confused.

1956
02:14:39,050 --> 02:14:42,970
I'll have you know that I I you got me paranoid.

1957
02:14:43,529 --> 02:14:48,090
The germa paranoia rubbed off on me and I did get some anti-worm medicine.

1958
02:14:51,659 --> 02:14:54,520
Yeah, I figured, you know, why not?

1959
02:14:54,520 --> 02:14:55,000
Why not?

1960
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:56,119
Just in case.

1961
02:14:56,119 --> 02:14:58,819
Hey, facts.

1962
02:15:00,739 --> 02:15:02,899
I love how you don't know even what that is.

1963
02:15:02,899 --> 02:15:03,380
Oh, yeah.

1964
02:15:03,380 --> 02:15:03,859
Yeah, of course.

1965
02:15:03,859 --> 02:15:08,970
Like, you know, of course, who doesn't get anti-worm medication?

1966
02:15:12,949 --> 02:15:17,430
We had a brief discussion about health and wanting to always be cleanly and all that.

1967
02:15:18,310 --> 02:15:20,149
I just inferred it had something to do with that.

1968
02:15:20,149 --> 02:15:21,909
Yeah, but I do have no idea.

1969
02:15:21,909 --> 02:15:27,189
Absolutely all just completely flushed straight out into the diaper.

1970
02:15:27,189 --> 02:15:28,550
This is a weird one tonight.

1971
02:15:30,090 --> 02:15:31,449
Hey, man, I'm ready to go.

1972
02:15:31,449 --> 02:15:32,729
You're out here buying weapons.

1973
02:15:32,729 --> 02:15:34,569
I just look at my store.

1974
02:15:34,569 --> 02:15:38,970
No one can kill him and he just walks around like like what is this game?

1975
02:15:38,970 --> 02:15:41,289
Yeah, but I have to I have to put stuff in my inventory.

1976
02:15:41,289 --> 02:15:43,050
I have to sell the stuff I got.

1977
02:15:43,050 --> 02:15:45,529
Okay, so empty your inventory.

1978
02:15:45,529 --> 02:15:49,529
Okay, let's take off all your clothes.

1979
02:15:49,529 --> 02:15:51,430
Okay, you ready?

1980
02:15:51,430 --> 02:15:51,909
Yes.

1981
02:15:51,909 --> 02:15:54,729
Let's go ma no worms.

1982
02:15:54,729 --> 02:15:56,569
By the way, I brought a campfire.

1983
02:15:57,130 --> 02:15:58,420
Oh, good, good, good.

1984
02:15:58,420 --> 02:16:05,340
You can use the campfire not only to heal, but it also replenishes your abilities.

1985
02:16:05,340 --> 02:16:07,020
Yeah, that was we would ask that.

1986
02:16:07,020 --> 02:16:09,899
So is it all abilities or is it just some of them or?

1987
02:16:09,899 --> 02:16:10,619
Pretty much.

1988
02:16:10,619 --> 02:16:13,180
It's like it's like a DND short rest pretty much.

1989
02:16:13,180 --> 02:16:14,060
Yeah.

1990
02:16:14,060 --> 02:16:15,340
So you get some spell slots.

1991
02:16:15,340 --> 02:16:19,899
It's actually I'm really glad the whole pork arc happens because now I know that me

1992
02:16:20,539 --> 02:16:23,899
and my horse don't have worms and I definitely don't have COVID.

1993
02:16:25,500 --> 02:16:26,380
Your horse?

1994
02:16:26,380 --> 02:16:26,939
What do you wait?

1995
02:16:26,939 --> 02:16:27,739
Hold on.

1996
02:16:28,380 --> 02:16:31,420
Did this just turn what is going on?

1997
02:16:31,420 --> 02:16:33,100
I need some sort of fill in here.

1998
02:16:33,100 --> 02:16:33,819
Maybe I don't.

1999
02:16:33,819 --> 02:16:35,500
No, I hear you stir.

2000
02:16:35,500 --> 02:16:37,420
Can I give him just this quick TLDR?

2001
02:16:37,420 --> 02:16:39,100
That was that was too deep of a joke.

2002
02:16:39,100 --> 02:16:39,340
I'm sorry.

2003
02:16:39,340 --> 02:16:41,030
Yeah, give him the TLDR.

2004
02:16:41,030 --> 02:16:45,719
So stir had it had a backpack and he had he went grocery shopping.

2005
02:16:45,719 --> 02:16:50,600
You know, those kind of ready made but raw meals like, oh, it's a pork chop and potatoes.

2006
02:16:50,600 --> 02:16:53,000
And it's just like kind of in the grocery store and you put it in the oven.

2007
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
It's like a ready made thing for you just to put it in the oven.

2008
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:58,549
He left it out for 16 hours accidentally.

2009
02:16:58,549 --> 02:17:00,760
Get a backpack on the floor.

2010
02:17:00,760 --> 02:17:01,510
All right.

2011
02:17:01,510 --> 02:17:03,030
You're going to want to talk to my wife about that.

2012
02:17:07,079 --> 02:17:08,620
Nah, wait, take this.

2013
02:17:08,620 --> 02:17:10,149
That's worth a lot of money.

2014
02:17:10,149 --> 02:17:11,670
She's trying to kill me, dude.

2015
02:17:11,670 --> 02:17:12,680
What?

2016
02:17:13,399 --> 02:17:15,559
Yeah, actually, who?

2017
02:17:15,559 --> 02:17:16,680
That's not a defrost.

2018
02:17:16,680 --> 02:17:21,579
That's like a that's like a re like that's making it wrong and like unhealthy.

2019
02:17:21,579 --> 02:17:27,989
We're going all like I was just hit him with the sword.

2020
02:17:27,989 --> 02:17:30,629
All right, boys.

2021
02:17:30,629 --> 02:17:32,069
I'm kind of a boxing match.

2022
02:17:32,069 --> 02:17:34,979
There's a guy down here.

2023
02:17:34,979 --> 02:17:35,379
Got him.

2024
02:17:41,659 --> 02:17:42,299
He's dead.

2025
02:17:42,299 --> 02:17:43,340
Oh, yes.

2026
02:17:43,340 --> 02:17:43,899
What do you got?

2027
02:17:44,700 --> 02:17:47,500
I actually have to I have to actually can't fire now.

2028
02:17:47,500 --> 02:17:52,139
I have the surgical kit with me either shield you want to go.

2029
02:17:52,139 --> 02:17:54,139
Yeah, I'll trade you the campfire for that.

2030
02:17:54,139 --> 02:17:55,100
I put it down.

2031
02:17:55,100 --> 02:17:55,739
Oh, my God.

2032
02:17:55,739 --> 02:18:00,120
Bless this man, sir.

2033
02:18:00,120 --> 02:18:04,219
Do you want I have a heater shield from that and a survival?

2034
02:18:04,219 --> 02:18:06,299
There's I don't need a weapon.

2035
02:18:06,299 --> 02:18:10,520
You realize if you go to you're going to like we run into a group of three.

2036
02:18:10,520 --> 02:18:12,440
I don't think I need a weapon is what I'm seeing.

2037
02:18:16,489 --> 02:18:19,209
Look at I move a bit faster while it's holstered.

2038
02:18:19,530 --> 02:18:20,170
Okay, so you're full.

2039
02:18:20,809 --> 02:18:21,049
All right.

2040
02:18:21,049 --> 02:18:21,450
You're good.

2041
02:18:21,450 --> 02:18:23,030
Yep.

2042
02:18:23,030 --> 02:18:27,430
Hey, Jeff, I would watch the confidence level here because it's so it's so simple to have

2043
02:18:27,430 --> 02:18:32,870
somebody have an equal amount of good gear on them and be an equally good player and

2044
02:18:32,870 --> 02:18:34,309
wipe the floor with the whole group.

2045
02:18:34,309 --> 02:18:36,149
I don't think anyone's better than.

2046
02:18:41,959 --> 02:18:42,600
All right, I'm leaving.

2047
02:18:43,319 --> 02:18:44,440
Give me give me your candy.

2048
02:18:46,520 --> 02:18:48,040
I just got hit twice.

2049
02:18:48,040 --> 02:18:49,559
You wanted to say it so bad.

2050
02:18:50,520 --> 02:18:52,920
Oh, my God, please take these, please.

2051
02:18:55,700 --> 02:18:56,340
What's your name again?

2052
02:18:59,059 --> 02:19:03,860
Because his name, the in game name like get educated.

2053
02:19:03,860 --> 02:19:06,500
I want to say it differently.

2054
02:19:06,500 --> 02:19:07,379
That's what I'm saying.

2055
02:19:07,379 --> 02:19:09,139
I know you say it that way.

2056
02:19:09,139 --> 02:19:09,540
I know.

2057
02:19:09,540 --> 02:19:10,739
So I had to check myself.

2058
02:19:11,299 --> 02:19:15,750
That's all I'm saying is I checked like the worms are getting to your brain.

2059
02:19:15,750 --> 02:19:16,709
There's no worms.

2060
02:19:16,709 --> 02:19:17,670
I dewormed.

2061
02:19:18,309 --> 02:19:19,030
Sure you did.

2062
02:19:19,030 --> 02:19:22,649
Now, oh, friends, we got friends.

2063
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:26,200
Oh, God, he's a ranger.

2064
02:19:26,200 --> 02:19:26,920
He's a ranger.

2065
02:19:26,920 --> 02:19:29,159
Stop, stop, stop.

2066
02:19:29,159 --> 02:19:30,680
I just took my horse dewormer.

2067
02:19:30,680 --> 02:19:31,799
I can't go out like this.

2068
02:19:33,399 --> 02:19:36,120
I'm just going to hide over here for a second like this, dude.

2069
02:19:36,120 --> 02:19:37,479
Please, please.

2070
02:19:37,479 --> 02:19:38,200
I'm one hit.

2071
02:19:38,200 --> 02:19:38,680
Don't do it.

2072
02:19:40,170 --> 02:19:40,649
Are they coming?

2073
02:19:40,649 --> 02:19:41,129
I'm scared.

2074
02:19:41,129 --> 02:19:42,489
They are preparing.

2075
02:19:43,770 --> 02:19:44,649
Let's actually go for this.

2076
02:19:44,649 --> 02:19:45,530
I don't know how we do this.

2077
02:19:45,530 --> 02:19:46,729
Somebody has to open the door.

2078
02:19:46,729 --> 02:19:47,770
I'm going to run you.

2079
02:19:47,770 --> 02:19:48,649
I'm running you.

2080
02:19:48,649 --> 02:19:48,889
All right.

2081
02:19:48,889 --> 02:19:51,129
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to pot up.

2082
02:19:51,129 --> 02:19:52,409
I'm going to I'm going to envis.

2083
02:19:52,409 --> 02:19:53,049
I'm going to envis.

2084
02:19:55,719 --> 02:19:57,239
And then you just you just run past me.

2085
02:19:57,239 --> 02:19:58,040
Just run past me.

2086
02:19:58,040 --> 02:19:58,600
I'll fuck him up.

2087
02:19:58,600 --> 02:19:58,840
OK.

2088
02:19:59,479 --> 02:20:01,209
Here, come over.

2089
02:20:01,209 --> 02:20:02,250
I'm invisible as well.

2090
02:20:02,250 --> 02:20:03,290
Oh, you're screwed.

2091
02:20:03,290 --> 02:20:03,930
Yeah, you're the only one.

2092
02:20:03,930 --> 02:20:05,610
They're turning off the only one.

2093
02:20:05,610 --> 02:20:06,569
I'll turn lights off, too.

2094
02:20:06,569 --> 02:20:07,049
Fuck that.

2095
02:20:08,170 --> 02:20:09,129
Yeah.

2096
02:20:09,129 --> 02:20:10,819
Who said you get there?

2097
02:20:10,819 --> 02:20:12,440
They're walking away.

2098
02:20:12,440 --> 02:20:13,239
They walk away.

2099
02:20:13,799 --> 02:20:14,840
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2100
02:20:14,840 --> 02:20:15,799
No, no, no, no, no.

2101
02:20:15,799 --> 02:20:17,639
Even darkness is your ally.

2102
02:20:17,639 --> 02:20:19,940
I was born in it.

2103
02:20:19,940 --> 02:20:23,290
And you from the darkness should become blind.

2104
02:20:23,290 --> 02:20:27,670
That's pretty good.

2105
02:20:27,670 --> 02:20:28,540
All right.

2106
02:20:28,540 --> 02:20:29,659
I can do better.

2107
02:20:29,739 --> 02:20:30,299
Yeah.

2108
02:20:30,299 --> 02:20:33,299
Oh, you think the darkness is your ally?

2109
02:20:33,299 --> 02:20:34,540
My God.

2110
02:20:34,540 --> 02:20:35,899
You see the darkness now.

2111
02:20:36,700 --> 02:20:41,620
I believe that you and I will have a fight in the darkness.

2112
02:20:41,620 --> 02:20:42,899
Bruce Wayne.

2113
02:20:44,360 --> 02:20:45,319
Where's Rachel?

2114
02:20:47,739 --> 02:20:48,620
Where is she?

2115
02:20:48,620 --> 02:20:50,059
They're doing the same thing.

2116
02:20:50,059 --> 02:20:50,780
I just looked over there.

2117
02:20:50,780 --> 02:20:52,309
They're literally doing the same thing.

2118
02:20:52,309 --> 02:20:52,870
Oh, dude.

2119
02:20:52,870 --> 02:20:55,030
Well, they're the thing is they're bad.

2120
02:20:55,030 --> 02:20:55,510
We're good.

2121
02:20:56,649 --> 02:20:57,610
There's a difference.

2122
02:20:57,610 --> 02:20:58,489
Actually, I can't see.

2123
02:20:58,489 --> 02:21:01,139
Hold on.

2124
02:21:01,139 --> 02:21:02,020
It was kind of weird.

2125
02:21:02,020 --> 02:21:05,270
I'm going.

2126
02:21:05,270 --> 02:21:06,709
Let's go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

2127
02:21:07,590 --> 02:21:08,149
Going, going.

2128
02:21:10,620 --> 02:21:11,500
I'm doing alchemy.

2129
02:21:14,629 --> 02:21:15,430
Oh, he froze me.

2130
02:21:18,059 --> 02:21:18,540
Free tech.

2131
02:21:20,709 --> 02:21:21,190
One down.

2132
02:21:21,909 --> 02:21:27,000
It's so dark.

2133
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:28,440
I don't know where I am.

2134
02:21:28,440 --> 02:21:29,479
Who's alive?

2135
02:21:31,879 --> 02:21:33,079
Oh, should I just hit you?

2136
02:21:33,079 --> 02:21:33,479
I just.

2137
02:21:33,479 --> 02:21:34,040
No.

2138
02:21:34,040 --> 02:21:34,520
Fuck.

2139
02:21:34,520 --> 02:21:35,879
Sterling, you killed me.

2140
02:21:35,879 --> 02:21:36,379
Sterling.

2141
02:21:37,239 --> 02:21:38,680
The darkness is your ally.

2142
02:21:38,680 --> 02:21:39,159
Oh, my God.

2143
02:21:39,159 --> 02:21:39,659
You killed him.

2144
02:21:41,159 --> 02:21:42,360
You just killed me.

2145
02:21:42,360 --> 02:21:44,440
Never turn off the lights again, you troglodyte.

2146
02:21:44,440 --> 02:21:45,079
Holy shit.

2147
02:21:45,719 --> 02:21:46,280
Wait, what?

2148
02:21:46,280 --> 02:21:47,959
Backwards and not swinging.

2149
02:21:47,959 --> 02:21:48,840
Saw you die.

2150
02:21:48,840 --> 02:21:50,360
And you're like, oh, it was stir.

2151
02:21:51,319 --> 02:21:52,600
I didn't, dude.

2152
02:21:53,319 --> 02:21:56,600
You hit in the back.

2153
02:21:57,399 --> 02:21:57,959
It's cool.

2154
02:22:05,180 --> 02:22:05,979
Pervert.

2155
02:22:05,979 --> 02:22:07,819
With your sweet hander.

2156
02:22:09,049 --> 02:22:10,090
Oh, my goodness.

2157
02:22:10,649 --> 02:22:11,850
That was so scary.

2158
02:22:11,850 --> 02:22:13,850
I thought I honestly thought you were going to die in there.

2159
02:22:14,809 --> 02:22:16,170
It goes lair.

2160
02:22:16,170 --> 02:22:17,370
Do you want to camp?

2161
02:22:19,270 --> 02:22:20,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2162
02:22:20,790 --> 02:22:21,290
100%.

2163
02:22:23,610 --> 02:22:24,659
All right.

2164
02:22:24,659 --> 02:22:25,219
I killed.

2165
02:22:25,219 --> 02:22:26,819
Hey, I did get a full.

2166
02:22:26,819 --> 02:22:29,690
I killed somebody in the very beginning.

2167
02:22:29,690 --> 02:22:30,250
I helped.

2168
02:22:30,250 --> 02:22:32,489
And then I may have hit you in the rib cage.

2169
02:22:33,290 --> 02:22:37,540
To be fair, the lights were off and they turned on.

2170
02:22:37,540 --> 02:22:38,819
And it was just people around me.

2171
02:22:38,819 --> 02:22:40,100
And I didn't know who was who.

2172
02:22:42,100 --> 02:22:43,379
I turned on the light.

2173
02:22:43,379 --> 02:22:46,569
I was holding the torch.

2174
02:22:47,209 --> 02:22:48,809
I was giving you light.

2175
02:22:48,809 --> 02:22:51,850
And then you hit your ally and then blamed your other ally.

2176
02:22:51,850 --> 02:22:53,930
I thought you were just killing me.

2177
02:22:53,930 --> 02:22:55,049
How dare you turn on the lights?

2178
02:22:55,049 --> 02:22:55,850
That's why I hit him.

2179
02:22:56,819 --> 02:22:58,020
The first thing I saw.

2180
02:22:58,020 --> 02:22:58,739
I couldn't see.

2181
02:22:59,860 --> 02:23:01,940
As soon as I could see, I just started swinging.

2182
02:23:04,420 --> 02:23:08,100
The first thing I did when my vision came back was blindly swing in a circle.

2183
02:23:08,100 --> 02:23:10,340
But wait, there's context behind this.

2184
02:23:10,340 --> 02:23:10,979
I'm sorry.

2185
02:23:12,020 --> 02:23:16,420
It was six people in the same tiny little fucking area.

2186
02:23:16,420 --> 02:23:18,500
And the lights were all off.

2187
02:23:18,500 --> 02:23:20,100
So it's like, I don't know who lived it.

2188
02:23:20,100 --> 02:23:21,299
I know one of them died.

2189
02:23:21,299 --> 02:23:22,899
I didn't know that it's hard to see.

2190
02:23:22,899 --> 02:23:24,100
I know that maybe two of them died.

2191
02:23:24,100 --> 02:23:25,860
When the lights came back on, people are still swinging.

2192
02:23:25,860 --> 02:23:26,420
I'm like, wait a minute.

2193
02:23:26,420 --> 02:23:27,620
We might be hitting each other.

2194
02:23:27,620 --> 02:23:28,979
I hit you accidentally.

2195
02:23:28,979 --> 02:23:30,340
And then apologies.

2196
02:23:30,340 --> 02:23:32,180
I thought stir was just stabbing me in the face.

2197
02:23:32,979 --> 02:23:33,299
All right.

2198
02:23:33,299 --> 02:23:34,659
This is the wrong room.

2199
02:23:34,659 --> 02:23:36,100
Oh, no, not today.

2200
02:23:36,100 --> 02:23:36,819
Not today.

2201
02:23:36,819 --> 02:23:39,129
Oh, but you almost just got wrecked.

2202
02:23:41,129 --> 02:23:41,850
Yeah, yeah.

2203
02:23:43,860 --> 02:23:46,340
If I don't turn around quick enough, I will accidentally swing on you.

2204
02:23:46,420 --> 02:23:48,500
We got to I think if I'm not mistaken.

2205
02:23:48,500 --> 02:23:48,819
Hold on.

2206
02:23:48,819 --> 02:23:52,469
I mean, let me just kind of loud.

2207
02:23:52,469 --> 02:23:53,350
Is this a little loud?

2208
02:23:55,100 --> 02:23:56,219
Is that echoing?

2209
02:23:56,219 --> 02:23:57,180
No, you're good.

2210
02:23:57,180 --> 02:23:57,979
Does anyone hear us?

2211
02:23:59,100 --> 02:23:59,600
All right.

2212
02:24:01,719 --> 02:24:02,680
Come with me.

2213
02:24:02,680 --> 02:24:09,079
I think I think there might be like I come with you or qualm with you.

2214
02:24:09,079 --> 02:24:13,159
I was about to be over the I was going to go over comms and yell at you.

2215
02:24:13,159 --> 02:24:15,479
I was going to be like, stop team killing, team killing, team killing.

2216
02:24:15,479 --> 02:24:17,719
But that guy would have been like, what is this fucking kid talking about?

2217
02:24:19,159 --> 02:24:20,760
That's a good strategy.

2218
02:24:20,760 --> 02:24:22,120
Oh, no, this is awful.

2219
02:24:22,120 --> 02:24:23,379
All right.

2220
02:24:23,379 --> 02:24:24,819
I followed you to the grave.

2221
02:24:24,819 --> 02:24:25,219
I know.

2222
02:24:25,219 --> 02:24:25,940
I know.

2223
02:24:25,940 --> 02:24:26,899
It'll be okay.

2224
02:24:26,899 --> 02:24:27,459
You're being dramatic.

2225
02:24:28,940 --> 02:24:34,180
Oh, and here's a cleric trying to get a cheeky kill on me.

2226
02:24:34,180 --> 02:24:39,909
Oh, he died to a spike.

2227
02:24:39,909 --> 02:24:40,549
He was beautiful.

2228
02:24:40,549 --> 02:24:41,590
Wait, watch out.

2229
02:24:41,590 --> 02:24:43,510
I dropped caltrops on these stairs.

2230
02:24:43,510 --> 02:24:44,229
Oh, good.

2231
02:24:44,229 --> 02:24:47,049
He almost got used to her.

2232
02:24:47,049 --> 02:24:48,010
But he didn't.

2233
02:24:48,010 --> 02:24:48,889
It was calculated.

2234
02:24:49,610 --> 02:24:50,250
I don't know where they.

2235
02:24:50,250 --> 02:24:51,049
Oh, I see them now.

2236
02:24:51,049 --> 02:24:52,170
I got to go.

2237
02:24:52,170 --> 02:24:53,930
This game is so good.

2238
02:24:53,930 --> 02:24:54,569
It really is.

2239
02:24:58,139 --> 02:24:58,620
I don't.

2240
02:24:59,260 --> 02:24:59,500
All right.

2241
02:24:59,500 --> 02:25:00,700
I have these Heelys.

2242
02:25:00,700 --> 02:25:02,379
Oh, and I have another campfire.

2243
02:25:02,379 --> 02:25:03,100
Can you set this down?

2244
02:25:03,100 --> 02:25:06,860
Because I literally have the interaction speed of a walrus with no flippers.

2245
02:25:09,420 --> 02:25:09,899
Don't ask.

2246
02:25:10,620 --> 02:25:11,899
How long does it take for you?

2247
02:25:11,899 --> 02:25:15,899
That translates to when you do medical wraps and stuff, too.

2248
02:25:15,899 --> 02:25:16,059
Right.

2249
02:25:16,059 --> 02:25:16,299
Yeah.

2250
02:25:16,299 --> 02:25:16,780
Yeah.

2251
02:25:16,780 --> 02:25:17,420
You see this?

2252
02:25:17,420 --> 02:25:19,180
You see this?

2253
02:25:19,180 --> 02:25:21,819
I might as well be like rubbing my wounds with sandpaper.

2254
02:25:21,819 --> 02:25:24,360
It's so long.

2255
02:25:24,360 --> 02:25:26,360
I actually haven't like measured it out.

2256
02:25:26,360 --> 02:25:31,719
But like, what's your resourcefulness level or your attribute?

2257
02:25:31,719 --> 02:25:33,430
Because mine's 10.

2258
02:25:33,430 --> 02:25:34,229
Oh, my God.

2259
02:25:34,229 --> 02:25:34,709
That's low.

2260
02:25:35,670 --> 02:25:35,909
Yeah.

2261
02:25:35,909 --> 02:25:38,389
You know, big dumb and big bad.

2262
02:25:38,389 --> 02:25:38,709
Wow.

2263
02:25:38,709 --> 02:25:40,979
In my hands, basically.

2264
02:25:40,979 --> 02:25:41,940
32 strength, though.

2265
02:25:41,940 --> 02:25:43,620
That's pretty good, isn't it?

2266
02:25:43,620 --> 02:25:43,860
Yeah.

2267
02:25:43,860 --> 02:25:44,420
Yeah, it's nuts.

2268
02:25:45,770 --> 02:25:46,809
Do you not like lights?

2269
02:25:47,690 --> 02:25:49,610
What is up with you in turning off everything?

2270
02:25:49,610 --> 02:25:50,729
You are turning all the lights off.

2271
02:25:50,729 --> 02:25:54,420
Once shit goes down, I want to be able to go invisible in a corner.

2272
02:25:54,420 --> 02:25:57,899
You can do that with lights, though.

2273
02:25:57,899 --> 02:25:58,379
Can you?

2274
02:25:58,940 --> 02:25:59,180
Yes.

2275
02:25:59,819 --> 02:26:01,020
You just stealth anywhere?

2276
02:26:01,020 --> 02:26:02,219
This game's super unrealistic.

2277
02:26:02,219 --> 02:26:02,940
Yes.

2278
02:26:02,940 --> 02:26:03,180
Yeah.

2279
02:26:03,180 --> 02:26:03,979
As a rogue.

2280
02:26:03,979 --> 02:26:04,860
Not the magical.

2281
02:26:07,030 --> 02:26:09,350
This I'm like wondering why the heck you're turning off.

2282
02:26:09,350 --> 02:26:13,030
I can't see what I'm hitting when you when you interact so quickly.

2283
02:26:13,030 --> 02:26:13,829
Why not?

2284
02:26:13,829 --> 02:26:15,430
Oh, you know, that must be nice.

2285
02:26:15,430 --> 02:26:15,670
Yeah.

2286
02:26:15,670 --> 02:26:15,909
Watch this.

2287
02:26:15,909 --> 02:26:16,309
Watch this.

2288
02:26:16,309 --> 02:26:17,590
Watch you go turn off one.

2289
02:26:17,590 --> 02:26:18,469
Oh, this is a portal over here.

2290
02:26:18,469 --> 02:26:19,190
Beautiful.

2291
02:26:19,190 --> 02:26:19,979
Oh, no.

2292
02:26:19,979 --> 02:26:20,219
No.

2293
02:26:20,219 --> 02:26:21,100
These are players.

2294
02:26:21,100 --> 02:26:21,579
Oh, no.

2295
02:26:21,579 --> 02:26:22,219
This is a bad time.

2296
02:26:22,219 --> 02:26:23,579
See, this is where I'm running.

2297
02:26:23,579 --> 02:26:25,049
Now, this makes sense.

2298
02:26:25,049 --> 02:26:25,610
You run.

2299
02:26:25,610 --> 02:26:26,809
I will run, too.

2300
02:26:26,809 --> 02:26:27,850
I'll catch up.

2301
02:26:27,850 --> 02:26:28,090
Yep.

2302
02:26:28,090 --> 02:26:29,260
Yep.

2303
02:26:29,260 --> 02:26:31,190
See, I open that door.

2304
02:26:31,190 --> 02:26:31,909
I can't do that.

2305
02:26:33,219 --> 02:26:34,020
I can close them.

2306
02:26:34,020 --> 02:26:35,620
There's a there's a wraith in here.

2307
02:26:36,579 --> 02:26:37,139
Yeah.

2308
02:26:37,139 --> 02:26:38,100
Oh, God.

2309
02:26:38,180 --> 02:26:39,139
Just just just run.

2310
02:26:39,139 --> 02:26:45,750
Just run.

2311
02:26:45,750 --> 02:26:48,149
I must I must save this V hander.

2312
02:26:48,149 --> 02:26:49,340
All right, dude.

2313
02:26:49,340 --> 02:26:49,979
Yeah.

2314
02:26:49,979 --> 02:26:55,959
Oh, I shut the door on you a little.

2315
02:26:55,959 --> 02:26:57,239
It takes me five years to open this.

2316
02:26:57,239 --> 02:26:57,799
I hope you know.

2317
02:26:57,799 --> 02:26:58,680
You killed the man today.

2318
02:26:59,479 --> 02:27:00,760
You killed the Coom today.

2319
02:27:00,760 --> 02:27:01,719
You killed the Coom today.

2320
02:27:01,719 --> 02:27:02,680
I hope you know you did that.

2321
02:27:02,680 --> 02:27:03,559
Do you need it open?

2322
02:27:03,559 --> 02:27:04,280
I can open it.

2323
02:27:04,280 --> 02:27:04,600
No, no.

2324
02:27:04,600 --> 02:27:05,719
It's too late, dude.

2325
02:27:05,719 --> 02:27:06,280
I opened it.

2326
02:27:06,280 --> 02:27:08,860
Oh, no.

2327
02:27:08,860 --> 02:27:09,979
You killed the man today.

2328
02:27:09,979 --> 02:27:11,260
He's dead.

2329
02:27:11,260 --> 02:27:12,620
Sir, are you going to go get that fucking axe?

2330
02:27:12,620 --> 02:27:13,579
You killed the man today.

2331
02:27:13,579 --> 02:27:14,379
You killed the man today.

2332
02:27:14,379 --> 02:27:16,620
Sir, you killed the man today.

2333
02:27:16,620 --> 02:27:17,659
Don't even bother.

2334
02:27:17,659 --> 02:27:18,299
It's not worth it.

2335
02:27:18,299 --> 02:27:18,940
It's not worth it.

2336
02:27:20,940 --> 02:27:22,059
I can't believe it.

2337
02:27:22,059 --> 02:27:23,260
What are you doing?

2338
02:27:23,260 --> 02:27:24,860
Sir, what have you done?

2339
02:27:26,659 --> 02:27:27,459
Damn it.

2340
02:27:27,459 --> 02:27:28,180
It could have been us.

2341
02:27:29,139 --> 02:27:29,860
That could have been us.

2342
02:27:30,500 --> 02:27:31,780
All you had to do was fight them.

2343
02:27:33,930 --> 02:27:36,569
I I don't I'm not a part of this.

2344
02:27:39,540 --> 02:27:40,180
And you know what?

2345
02:27:40,180 --> 02:27:42,500
The worst part is we lost the Zwei hander.

2346
02:27:42,500 --> 02:27:44,100
You lost the Zwei hander, too.

2347
02:27:44,100 --> 02:27:45,860
Ah, we lost the Zwei hander.

2348
02:27:47,190 --> 02:27:49,670
Is there anywhere to know where portals

2349
02:27:49,670 --> 02:27:50,309
are appearing?

2350
02:27:51,239 --> 02:27:55,079
It's random and there's only enough for like one or two of you to get out.

2351
02:27:56,620 --> 02:28:00,059
They are random in this circle and there's only enough for maybe one more of you to leave.

2352
02:28:01,100 --> 02:28:01,579
There it is.

2353
02:28:02,840 --> 02:28:04,760
Wow, how poetic, too, just for us.

2354
02:28:04,760 --> 02:28:05,799
What do you have in your inventory?

2355
02:28:06,440 --> 02:28:08,600
Hey, I'm glad you got out of here with the ancient scroll.

2356
02:28:11,559 --> 02:28:18,299
We killed you.

2357
02:28:19,479 --> 02:28:21,000
Yeah, that's amazing.

2358
02:28:22,840 --> 02:28:26,729
Well, that was well back to remember our carry.

2359
02:28:27,530 --> 02:28:28,809
Well, now you don't have the weapon.

2360
02:28:29,450 --> 02:28:30,649
OK, that's beautiful.

2361
02:28:30,649 --> 02:28:31,370
I have multiple.

2362
02:28:34,329 --> 02:28:34,889
Wait, hold on.

2363
02:28:34,889 --> 02:28:38,709
Do you have like a whole closet of like Peter Griffin shirts?

2364
02:28:38,709 --> 02:28:40,309
Yeah, it's yeah.

2365
02:28:40,309 --> 02:28:41,590
Oh, I stay.

2366
02:28:41,590 --> 02:28:42,870
I keep that thing on me.

2367
02:28:42,870 --> 02:28:43,510
Oh, OK.

2368
02:28:45,780 --> 02:28:46,840
All right.

2369
02:28:46,840 --> 02:28:48,299
What do you think this is?

2370
02:28:48,299 --> 02:28:48,780
That's cool.

2371
02:28:48,780 --> 02:28:49,340
That's good.

2372
02:28:49,340 --> 02:28:50,059
Yeah, that works.

2373
02:28:52,069 --> 02:28:53,510
Yeah, we're good to go.

2374
02:28:53,510 --> 02:28:54,229
Actually, I have.

2375
02:28:55,350 --> 02:28:55,989
Oh, I know.

2376
02:28:55,989 --> 02:28:57,590
Wait, you're a rogue, right?

2377
02:28:57,590 --> 02:28:59,190
Oh, God, if you hadn't screwed me over.

2378
02:28:59,190 --> 02:29:02,309
I have like this nice blue stiletto dagger that I could give you.

2379
02:29:03,959 --> 02:29:04,200
Me?

2380
02:29:05,819 --> 02:29:09,020
The guy who left you to die.

2381
02:29:09,020 --> 02:29:10,649
What do you mean me?

2382
02:29:10,649 --> 02:29:12,569
Are you live right now, by the way?

2383
02:29:12,569 --> 02:29:13,129
Yes, yes.

2384
02:29:13,129 --> 02:29:14,329
Just in case people want to see your perspective.

2385
02:29:14,329 --> 02:29:14,889
I'm sorry.

2386
02:29:14,889 --> 02:29:16,889
I was ignoring you and reading a text message.

2387
02:29:16,889 --> 02:29:18,889
So I like only heard me.

2388
02:29:20,629 --> 02:29:21,110
You know what?

2389
02:29:21,110 --> 02:29:25,350
I hope that your horse dewormer was left out for 16 hours as well.

2390
02:29:27,190 --> 02:29:28,709
It almost made me want to throw up.

2391
02:29:28,709 --> 02:29:30,069
So it might as well have been.

2392
02:29:30,870 --> 02:29:34,790
This is a what an unbelievably strange conversation.

2393
02:29:35,979 --> 02:29:36,379
It's OK.

2394
02:29:36,379 --> 02:29:39,049
Rene, what's your Twitch?

2395
02:29:39,049 --> 02:29:44,139
It's just Joel's J-U-S-T-J-O-E-L-S.

2396
02:29:44,139 --> 02:29:47,750
So if you want to see the game or perspective.

2397
02:29:47,750 --> 02:29:48,389
They don't want that.

2398
02:29:48,389 --> 02:29:50,219
Some people do.

2399
02:29:50,219 --> 02:29:55,909
Some people like games.

2400
02:29:55,909 --> 02:29:56,149
All right.

2401
02:29:56,149 --> 02:29:58,629
Well, that was a fun one.

2402
02:29:59,430 --> 02:30:00,149
I had a good time.

2403
02:30:01,100 --> 02:30:01,739
Yeah.

2404
02:30:01,739 --> 02:30:03,559
Let's go again.

2405
02:30:03,559 --> 02:30:04,440
Yeah, let's run it.

2406
02:30:04,680 --> 02:30:11,399
But I have a necklace that I'm going to bring you so you can stay geared up.

2407
02:30:11,399 --> 02:30:12,680
I would recheck your shop.

2408
02:30:12,680 --> 02:30:14,659
Sometimes it does switch up.

2409
02:30:14,659 --> 02:30:15,159
Yeah.

2410
02:30:16,500 --> 02:30:18,100
Even when the timer is not up?

2411
02:30:18,100 --> 02:30:18,340
Yeah.

2412
02:30:18,340 --> 02:30:18,500
Yeah.

2413
02:30:18,500 --> 02:30:20,020
Sometimes it just randomly switches up.

2414
02:30:20,020 --> 02:30:21,540
I don't know why the timer is there.

2415
02:30:21,540 --> 02:30:22,180
I got to be honest.

2416
02:30:32,780 --> 02:30:33,659
It looks at the same.

2417
02:30:33,659 --> 02:30:35,059
I'll check it later.

2418
02:30:35,059 --> 02:30:36,100
I'll check it tomorrow, whatever.

2419
02:30:36,659 --> 02:30:38,579
Honestly, I might even be live during this.

2420
02:30:39,780 --> 02:30:40,739
Actually, probably not.

2421
02:30:40,739 --> 02:30:41,540
Let me think about it.

2422
02:30:43,879 --> 02:30:44,600
I'm going to bring.

2423
02:30:45,459 --> 02:30:48,950
I'm going to just bring like a decent one.

2424
02:30:48,950 --> 02:30:55,299
Yeah, I don't want to bring it in my blues.

2425
02:30:55,299 --> 02:30:55,700
I know.

2426
02:30:55,700 --> 02:30:56,579
I know.

2427
02:30:56,579 --> 02:30:57,139
Don't hoard.

2428
02:30:57,139 --> 02:30:57,780
Don't hoard.

2429
02:30:57,780 --> 02:30:58,659
Don't hoard it.

2430
02:30:58,659 --> 02:31:00,569
But it's nice to look at.

2431
02:31:00,569 --> 02:31:03,690
Okay, it's nice to be able to open my stash and look at all this money and go, wow, look

2432
02:31:03,690 --> 02:31:04,090
at that sword.

2433
02:31:04,090 --> 02:31:04,729
Look at those boots.

2434
02:31:04,729 --> 02:31:08,629
Look at that sword.

2435
02:31:08,629 --> 02:31:09,670
Listen to me, Jeremy.

2436
02:31:09,670 --> 02:31:12,549
If you don't bring a blue or like multiple blues with you, I'm just going to team kill

2437
02:31:12,549 --> 02:31:13,350
you when we get in here.

2438
02:31:13,350 --> 02:31:16,069
So the choice is yours at this point.

2439
02:31:16,069 --> 02:31:18,819
Bring the blues or suffer the consequences.

2440
02:31:18,819 --> 02:31:21,379
If you don't bring the blues, I'm going to shut that door in your face.

2441
02:31:21,379 --> 02:31:22,579
What the fuck?

2442
02:31:22,579 --> 02:31:24,260
I'm going to leave your dinner out for 16 hours.

2443
02:31:24,260 --> 02:31:24,899
How about that, pal?

2444
02:31:25,780 --> 02:31:26,920
Okay, what if I bring?

2445
02:31:29,559 --> 02:31:32,040
I need you to like strip down when we get in the lobby.

2446
02:31:32,040 --> 02:31:32,360
I got it.

2447
02:31:32,360 --> 02:31:32,680
I got it.

2448
02:31:32,680 --> 02:31:33,079
I got it.

2449
02:31:33,079 --> 02:31:36,629
I'm bringing a good item.

2450
02:31:36,629 --> 02:31:39,340
Two, at least.

2451
02:31:39,340 --> 02:31:40,459
That was the arrangement.

2452
02:31:40,459 --> 02:31:42,020
Okay.

2453
02:31:42,020 --> 02:31:43,700
I do have two good items on.

2454
02:31:44,420 --> 02:31:46,020
This thing is actually really good.

2455
02:31:46,020 --> 02:31:48,229
Whoever gets this, congratulations.

2456
02:31:53,209 --> 02:31:57,530
It's a different colored item.

2457
02:31:57,530 --> 02:32:02,219
It's a different like rarity than just the simple, the common.

2458
02:32:02,219 --> 02:32:02,940
Beautiful, beautiful.

2459
02:32:02,940 --> 02:32:03,420
Yeah, so we're good.

2460
02:32:03,420 --> 02:32:04,299
I like to hear that.

2461
02:32:04,299 --> 02:32:04,860
All right, let's go.

2462
02:32:08,040 --> 02:32:08,680
Yeah, let's go.

2463
02:32:08,680 --> 02:32:23,370
Term it ends in a few days.

2464
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,989
Yeah, we don't acknowledge it.

2465
02:32:27,989 --> 02:32:28,950
It's not real.

2466
02:32:28,950 --> 02:32:33,030
Just people saying that what may is when it might be coming back.

2467
02:32:35,850 --> 02:32:38,329
If they do a fifth play test, that's kind of wild.

2468
02:32:38,329 --> 02:32:40,649
I don't know what else they would add other than like other areas,

2469
02:32:40,649 --> 02:32:43,930
kind of like in Tarkov, like you have like storage factory and all that.

2470
02:32:43,930 --> 02:32:46,250
And so it's going to go into open beta.

2471
02:32:46,250 --> 02:32:49,530
Or I mean, are they going to how much is it going to be free to play?

2472
02:32:49,530 --> 02:32:50,569
Are they going to charge for it?

2473
02:32:50,569 --> 02:32:52,950
Like, I wonder what their plan is.

2474
02:32:52,950 --> 02:32:54,309
I would gladly pay money for this.

2475
02:32:54,309 --> 02:32:56,629
And if they don't charge for it, I will still pay money for this.

2476
02:32:56,950 --> 02:32:58,540
Yeah.

2477
02:32:58,540 --> 02:32:59,899
All right, team killer.

2478
02:32:59,899 --> 02:33:02,229
Here you go.

2479
02:33:02,229 --> 02:33:03,670
No, that's not you're not team killer.

2480
02:33:03,670 --> 02:33:05,450
No, no, that's that's not you.

2481
02:33:05,450 --> 02:33:08,250
OK, this is this is for you.

2482
02:33:08,250 --> 02:33:09,850
I just want to see what that internet.

2483
02:33:09,850 --> 02:33:12,340
Hey, how come we're picking up chalices all the time?

2484
02:33:12,340 --> 02:33:15,219
There's a bunch of chalices on this table, but I can't pick up these chalices.

2485
02:33:15,219 --> 02:33:17,139
Hey, sir, you actually take this.

2486
02:33:17,139 --> 02:33:18,340
Maybe the table is broken.

2487
02:33:18,340 --> 02:33:19,139
Hold on.

2488
02:33:19,139 --> 02:33:23,049
Sir, you're going to want to wait.

2489
02:33:23,049 --> 02:33:25,129
That's how you should kind of hold on.

2490
02:33:25,129 --> 02:33:27,459
Oh, you brought me the blue.

2491
02:33:27,459 --> 02:33:28,020
Yeah.

2492
02:33:28,020 --> 02:33:29,700
So now we won't team kill us.

2493
02:33:29,700 --> 02:33:32,579
That's that's that's what team team works all about.

2494
02:33:32,739 --> 02:33:34,819
Teamwork, teamwork.

2495
02:33:34,819 --> 02:33:36,979
That does like a lot more damage.

2496
02:33:37,540 --> 02:33:37,780
Yeah.

2497
02:33:37,780 --> 02:33:41,860
So that right click, honestly, the stiletto combo is the best combo from what I remember.

2498
02:33:42,420 --> 02:33:43,299
Don't don't even.

2499
02:33:43,299 --> 02:33:44,180
Yeah, don't even mess.

2500
02:33:44,180 --> 02:33:45,540
Yeah, just just that right there.

2501
02:33:45,540 --> 02:33:46,899
You're going to just wax.

2502
02:33:46,899 --> 02:33:49,270
Hey, try it on my face.

2503
02:33:49,270 --> 02:33:49,590
Yeah.

2504
02:33:49,590 --> 02:33:50,229
Yep.

2505
02:33:50,229 --> 02:33:52,889
Well, I mean, I could try it on a zombie face.

2506
02:33:54,569 --> 02:33:55,850
We actually probably should go.

2507
02:33:55,850 --> 02:33:56,950
Oh, no, we can't.

2508
02:33:56,950 --> 02:33:58,069
This guy is dying for us.

2509
02:33:58,069 --> 02:33:59,030
That's so sweet.

2510
02:33:59,030 --> 02:34:01,239
Oh, what a swell guy.

2511
02:34:01,239 --> 02:34:01,799
Pretty sick.

2512
02:34:02,360 --> 02:34:04,299
Hey, can we start a potion?

2513
02:34:04,540 --> 02:34:09,299
Nice guy lights off real quick lights off.

2514
02:34:10,200 --> 02:34:11,159
Honestly, I was kind of upset.

2515
02:34:11,159 --> 02:34:14,180
I could see the game for a second.

2516
02:34:14,180 --> 02:34:17,219
You got to take a cat's eye potion.

2517
02:34:17,219 --> 02:34:18,500
How many subs to take out?

2518
02:34:18,500 --> 02:34:19,940
One hundred, one hundred subs.

2519
02:34:19,940 --> 02:34:21,540
I'll team kill German immediately.

2520
02:34:21,540 --> 02:34:22,340
Someone's going to do that.

2521
02:34:22,340 --> 02:34:23,379
I just I hope you understand.

2522
02:34:23,379 --> 02:34:24,500
That's going to happen in like five seconds.

2523
02:34:28,440 --> 02:34:32,200
This is no, no, no, no, we're not paying that.

2524
02:34:32,200 --> 02:34:33,559
No, no, I have nothing to do with this.

2525
02:34:39,579 --> 02:34:42,059
That would be that would be unbelievable.

2526
02:34:42,059 --> 02:34:45,899
And let me tell you something, by the way, the guy trapped in the electric chair.

2527
02:34:46,299 --> 02:34:47,180
I have nothing to do with it.

2528
02:34:47,180 --> 02:34:51,100
Oh, yeah, I'm going over this right now.

2529
02:34:51,100 --> 02:34:55,899
I got shit for spending seventy five bucks on the fucking family guy mobile game.

2530
02:34:55,899 --> 02:34:59,739
If you spend five hundred bucks on killing me in this game.

2531
02:35:00,790 --> 02:35:01,829
Excuse me.

2532
02:35:01,829 --> 02:35:02,629
What do you think?

2533
02:35:02,629 --> 02:35:06,340
I have fruit fruitless fucking expenses.

2534
02:35:06,340 --> 02:35:07,860
Wait, seventy five dollars.

2535
02:35:10,180 --> 02:35:10,659
Explain.

2536
02:35:11,780 --> 02:35:13,700
That's a bit that's a bit obsessive.

2537
02:35:13,700 --> 02:35:14,579
OK, it was.

2538
02:35:15,540 --> 02:35:18,649
But it was I could tap on the houses.

2539
02:35:20,569 --> 02:35:22,250
He could tap on the houses.

2540
02:35:22,809 --> 02:35:23,610
Oh, my God.

2541
02:35:23,610 --> 02:35:29,829
Did give this guy a mobile game and he'll give you a hundred dollars.

2542
02:35:30,870 --> 02:35:31,909
Dark and dark.

2543
02:35:31,909 --> 02:35:33,510
The mobile game releases tomorrow.

2544
02:35:35,299 --> 02:35:37,299
Inventory Management 2.0.

2545
02:35:37,299 --> 02:35:40,500
Jeremy, I can't believe you spent like 70 bucks on that game.

2546
02:35:40,500 --> 02:35:42,579
That's like what a bad purchase.

2547
02:35:42,579 --> 02:35:44,100
Hey, hey, hey, other streamer.

2548
02:35:44,100 --> 02:35:45,540
Here's five hundred.

2549
02:35:46,340 --> 02:35:46,979
Oh, Jesus.

2550
02:35:48,760 --> 02:35:50,280
Somebody paid this motherfucker.

2551
02:35:50,280 --> 02:35:50,920
Somebody paid him.

2552
02:35:59,739 --> 02:36:03,500
Did you actually get somebody actually give you what I just saw?

2553
02:36:03,500 --> 02:36:04,700
I just saw him take you down.

2554
02:36:04,700 --> 02:36:06,299
I just I felt compelled to do it.

2555
02:36:06,299 --> 02:36:06,940
Like now.

2556
02:36:06,940 --> 02:36:07,500
Oh, my God.

2557
02:36:07,500 --> 02:36:08,620
What have I done?

2558
02:36:08,620 --> 02:36:11,020
Now you're alone and you're not.

2559
02:36:11,020 --> 02:36:13,180
You're alone and you've got a really good axe.

2560
02:36:13,180 --> 02:36:16,139
And I hope you got a whole fucking closet of Peter Griffin shirts because that one's

2561
02:36:16,139 --> 02:36:17,979
gone to listen.

2562
02:36:17,979 --> 02:36:21,290
Listen, I didn't do it for the money.

2563
02:36:21,290 --> 02:36:27,879
Ethan, I did it for the club to be able to say that I'm a virtual assassin.

2564
02:36:27,879 --> 02:36:30,440
Yeah, I've got a paid hit job on my record.

2565
02:36:30,440 --> 02:36:31,559
Oh, my God.

2566
02:36:31,559 --> 02:36:35,850
He's not to extract quickly because now I feel bad.

2567
02:36:36,409 --> 02:36:39,940
Well, you also are potentially going against multiple.

2568
02:36:39,940 --> 02:36:42,069
Is this a blue or is this purple?

2569
02:36:42,069 --> 02:36:43,110
Oh, this is a perp.

2570
02:36:44,069 --> 02:36:45,750
You can press tab to inspect my inventory.

2571
02:36:45,750 --> 02:36:47,190
You can see the drip I got on.

2572
02:36:47,190 --> 02:36:48,309
Thank you so much, Disco.

2573
02:36:48,309 --> 02:36:49,270
Oh, my God.

2574
02:36:50,629 --> 02:36:51,190
Yeah, watch this.

2575
02:36:51,190 --> 02:36:51,750
Do watch this.

2576
02:36:51,750 --> 02:36:52,149
Watch this.

2577
02:36:52,149 --> 02:36:54,549
Also, anytime I kill an enemy, I get plus 10 strength.

2578
02:36:55,670 --> 02:36:56,680
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

2579
02:36:56,680 --> 02:36:56,920
Plus.

2580
02:36:56,920 --> 02:36:57,799
Yeah, plus 10 strength.

2581
02:36:57,799 --> 02:36:58,120
I'm sorry.

2582
02:36:58,120 --> 02:36:58,680
That's what it is.

2583
02:36:58,680 --> 02:36:59,479
Oh, jeez.

2584
02:37:02,569 --> 02:37:04,090
And then I get a little buff after that.

2585
02:37:04,090 --> 02:37:05,370
It's it's it's amazing.

2586
02:37:05,370 --> 02:37:06,090
It really is.

2587
02:37:06,090 --> 02:37:12,409
I can't fucking believe that there was just a literal assassin kill transaction that just

2588
02:37:12,409 --> 02:37:14,649
played out on the stream.

2589
02:37:14,649 --> 02:37:19,850
That's going to it's going to be a real boon to my virtual assassin business.

2590
02:37:19,850 --> 02:37:20,809
I'm starting.

2591
02:37:20,809 --> 02:37:22,520
What are you going to call your

2592
02:37:22,840 --> 02:37:23,719
testimonials?

2593
02:37:23,719 --> 02:37:24,040
I have.

2594
02:37:24,040 --> 02:37:26,760
Oh, I killed German 985 in dark and darker.

2595
02:37:26,760 --> 02:37:29,799
Yeah, you know, you get and you'll have like you have a quote from me, right?

2596
02:37:29,799 --> 02:37:33,000
It's like in like a little test, like, oh, man, like, what the fuck, dude?

2597
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:34,040
I can't believe you did that.

2598
02:37:34,040 --> 02:37:38,459
And it says like, and then in like brackets, really pissed off.

2599
02:37:38,459 --> 02:37:42,100
Yeah, it's already being set up.

2600
02:37:42,100 --> 02:37:43,540
I can go take out anyone.

2601
02:37:43,540 --> 02:37:44,420
Oh, time.

2602
02:37:44,420 --> 02:37:45,059
Yeah, boys.

2603
02:37:50,979 --> 02:37:51,620
Nice interaction.

2604
02:37:51,620 --> 02:37:52,420
You don't need to do it.

2605
02:37:52,420 --> 02:37:53,780
Look what you've done.

2606
02:37:53,780 --> 02:37:54,600
Yeah.

2607
02:37:54,600 --> 02:37:56,600
Oh, no, this is the worst room.

2608
02:37:56,600 --> 02:38:00,059
Oh, don't do it.

2609
02:38:00,059 --> 02:38:00,860
Don't do it, bro.

2610
02:38:00,860 --> 02:38:01,500
I'm a good.

2611
02:38:01,579 --> 02:38:02,620
I'm a good boy.

2612
02:38:02,620 --> 02:38:05,000
I'm a good person person.

2613
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:06,600
Well, let me turn off the light so I can't see shit.

2614
02:38:17,540 --> 02:38:18,659
Did they actually leave me alone?

2615
02:38:18,659 --> 02:38:19,940
These these nerds?

2616
02:38:20,500 --> 02:38:21,379
Maybe they didn't.

2617
02:38:21,379 --> 02:38:28,340
Maybe they don't know who you are.

2618
02:38:28,340 --> 02:38:32,790
Oh, oh, oh, my goodness.

2619
02:38:33,510 --> 02:38:34,549
Oh, that.

2620
02:38:34,549 --> 02:38:35,190
Oh, man.

2621
02:38:37,290 --> 02:38:43,540
He just like, I feel for that guy because like, that's me.

2622
02:38:44,340 --> 02:38:45,219
That's your future.

2623
02:38:45,219 --> 02:38:47,540
His future was indeed ratchet, wasn't it?

2624
02:38:47,540 --> 02:38:48,420
That's me.

2625
02:38:48,420 --> 02:38:48,899
That's me.

2626
02:38:48,979 --> 02:38:51,540
Like, I've been in that scenario like 30 times.

2627
02:38:52,760 --> 02:38:53,399
I feel for that guy.

2628
02:38:53,399 --> 02:38:55,590
I really do.

2629
02:38:55,590 --> 02:38:57,030
All right, let's get out of here.

2630
02:38:57,030 --> 02:38:57,750
I'm scared.

2631
02:38:57,750 --> 02:39:00,950
Just trying to adventure.

2632
02:39:00,950 --> 02:39:05,829
Just trying to get gear and shit.

2633
02:39:05,829 --> 02:39:08,979
I got a lot of loot this level.

2634
02:39:08,979 --> 02:39:09,459
You're dead.

2635
02:39:10,329 --> 02:39:12,649
Some say the loot is the friends are made along the way.

2636
02:39:12,649 --> 02:39:13,129
All right.

2637
02:39:13,129 --> 02:39:16,010
Oh, that dude is crying now.

2638
02:39:17,770 --> 02:39:19,370
You did get a lot of loot this level.

2639
02:39:19,370 --> 02:39:19,770
That's right.

2640
02:39:20,409 --> 02:39:21,690
Very profitable dungeon.

2641
02:39:21,690 --> 02:39:26,250
It was a good dungeon for you.

2642
02:39:26,250 --> 02:39:34,139
I got a rock.

2643
02:39:34,139 --> 02:39:35,100
Will you stop hitting me?

2644
02:39:35,659 --> 02:39:36,139
Thank you.

2645
02:39:39,399 --> 02:39:40,440
Oh, friends.

2646
02:39:41,079 --> 02:39:42,520
All right, here's the weak strat.

2647
02:39:42,520 --> 02:39:42,920
Watch that.

2648
02:39:42,920 --> 02:39:44,040
I have feign weakness, right?

2649
02:39:46,219 --> 02:39:47,579
Don't, please, please.

2650
02:39:47,579 --> 02:39:48,299
No, stop, please.

2651
02:39:49,180 --> 02:39:49,909
Oh, my God.

2652
02:39:49,909 --> 02:39:51,670
Please, no, please, God, no, please.

2653
02:39:51,670 --> 02:39:54,309
But you roared and that's a sign of aggression.

2654
02:39:54,309 --> 02:39:55,430
I don't know if I would.

2655
02:39:55,430 --> 02:39:56,069
I'd probably attack.

2656
02:40:06,549 --> 02:40:07,030
I'm still here.

2657
02:40:07,030 --> 02:40:10,520
I'm still here.

2658
02:40:10,520 --> 02:40:12,520
This is where you have to say like your controller unplugged.

2659
02:40:19,379 --> 02:40:20,659
Steps is what you're doing.

2660
02:40:20,659 --> 02:40:21,139
Steps is what you're doing.

2661
02:40:21,139 --> 02:40:21,540
I'm stuck.

2662
02:40:21,540 --> 02:40:22,020
I'm stuck.

2663
02:40:22,020 --> 02:40:23,940
I'm stuck in the gate.

2664
02:40:23,940 --> 02:40:24,420
Oh, my God.

2665
02:40:24,420 --> 02:40:24,819
Oh, my God.

2666
02:40:24,819 --> 02:40:25,700
These guys suck.

2667
02:40:25,700 --> 02:40:27,610
Have you seen that poke clip?

2668
02:40:27,610 --> 02:40:28,090
Yeah.

2669
02:40:28,090 --> 02:40:28,729
It was amazing.

2670
02:40:28,729 --> 02:40:30,409
So fucking unbelievably funny.

2671
02:40:32,219 --> 02:40:33,899
Oh, my controller is unplugged.

2672
02:40:33,899 --> 02:40:34,700
What the fuck?

2673
02:40:41,420 --> 02:40:42,540
He does it twice, too.

2674
02:40:42,540 --> 02:40:43,340
That's the best part.

2675
02:40:43,340 --> 02:40:44,219
It works two different times.

2676
02:40:44,219 --> 02:40:45,500
Do I get style points?

2677
02:40:45,500 --> 02:40:45,979
That's sweet.

2678
02:40:45,979 --> 02:40:46,780
Do you see that, dude?

2679
02:40:46,780 --> 02:40:47,819
Do you see that finesse?

2680
02:40:47,819 --> 02:40:48,700
That was actually pretty cool.

2681
02:40:51,860 --> 02:40:53,860
I'm kind of rooting for the zombie.

2682
02:40:56,360 --> 02:40:59,239
That's why nothing you've done today matters.

2683
02:40:59,239 --> 02:41:00,840
Well, I mean, you did kill somebody in cold.

2684
02:41:00,840 --> 02:41:01,399
Oh, Jesus.

2685
02:41:04,889 --> 02:41:05,370
I didn't mean it.

2686
02:41:05,370 --> 02:41:05,850
I didn't mean it.

2687
02:41:05,850 --> 02:41:06,250
I didn't mean it.

2688
02:41:06,250 --> 02:41:06,649
I'm sorry.

2689
02:41:06,649 --> 02:41:07,209
I'm sorry.

2690
02:41:07,209 --> 02:41:14,180
I'm sorry.

2691
02:41:14,180 --> 02:41:17,219
Oh, he shot me with a crossbow.

2692
02:41:17,219 --> 02:41:17,540
What?

2693
02:41:17,540 --> 02:41:18,260
He's a gamer.

2694
02:41:18,899 --> 02:41:19,940
Oh, my God.

2695
02:41:19,940 --> 02:41:21,379
Why didn't you just hit him on the head?

2696
02:41:24,120 --> 02:41:27,079
Because nobody paid me 50 subs for it.

2697
02:41:27,079 --> 02:41:27,479
That's why.

2698
02:41:27,479 --> 02:41:28,680
It's all Chad's fault.

2699
02:41:28,680 --> 02:41:29,159
That's why.

2700
02:41:29,159 --> 02:41:29,959
Oh, I'll tell you.

2701
02:41:29,959 --> 02:41:31,879
There's a whole battle going on after you died, too.

2702
02:41:31,879 --> 02:41:33,319
There was like a whole other group.

2703
02:41:33,319 --> 02:41:34,680
I mean, they're going to fight over that.

2704
02:41:34,680 --> 02:41:35,559
And it's all right.

2705
02:41:36,360 --> 02:41:37,799
You got a whole closet full of those things.

2706
02:41:37,799 --> 02:41:38,200
You're fine.

2707
02:41:38,840 --> 02:41:40,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2708
02:41:40,440 --> 02:41:42,440
I have the the bardish now.

2709
02:41:42,440 --> 02:41:43,479
This this bad girl.

2710
02:41:43,479 --> 02:41:44,520
I've been holding on to her.

2711
02:41:45,959 --> 02:41:46,840
I feel OK.

2712
02:41:46,840 --> 02:41:48,120
You know what's funny?

2713
02:41:48,120 --> 02:41:49,719
You've got all this really cool stuff.

2714
02:41:49,719 --> 02:41:52,040
And I correct me if I'm wrong here.

2715
02:41:52,040 --> 02:41:55,719
I believe your angle here is, you know, you probably would normally would be like,

2716
02:41:55,719 --> 02:41:58,360
this actually sucks that I'm losing this this this great stuff.

2717
02:41:58,360 --> 02:41:59,959
But you're like, hey, it's over in three days.

2718
02:42:01,079 --> 02:42:01,959
Literally, that's where I'm at.

2719
02:42:01,959 --> 02:42:03,000
That's where I've been.

2720
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:03,399
I got you.

2721
02:42:03,399 --> 02:42:03,879
I got you.

2722
02:42:03,879 --> 02:42:05,639
Since I got in this lobby, that's where I've been.

2723
02:42:05,639 --> 02:42:06,440
OK, I got you.

2724
02:42:09,129 --> 02:42:11,750
It's it's then I'll bring my blue.

2725
02:42:12,309 --> 02:42:12,629
Fine.

2726
02:42:12,629 --> 02:42:15,670
Oh, that's that's the blues are standing together.

2727
02:42:15,909 --> 02:42:16,790
This is what we need.

2728
02:42:16,790 --> 02:42:19,700
But OK, I'm bringing one blue.

2729
02:42:20,500 --> 02:42:23,530
But creepo, why don't you bring something about that?

2730
02:42:23,530 --> 02:42:25,209
I don't own anything.

2731
02:42:25,209 --> 02:42:25,610
All right.

2732
02:42:25,610 --> 02:42:29,819
Good thing I brought you a green stiletto broke ass bitch.

2733
02:42:29,819 --> 02:42:32,729
OK, I mean, I've got like 100 doubloons.

2734
02:42:38,899 --> 02:42:39,299
I don't know.

2735
02:42:39,299 --> 02:42:42,020
Should I buy something from those this lonely looking woodsman?

2736
02:42:43,620 --> 02:42:44,260
Probably not.

2737
02:42:44,979 --> 02:42:47,000
I love the artwork.

2738
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:50,250
Same reminds me of Magic the Gathering.

2739
02:42:50,250 --> 02:42:52,250
Hmm.

2740
02:42:52,250 --> 02:42:54,329
OK, who is your favorite character?

2741
02:42:54,329 --> 02:42:58,250
Like who is who would you like to spend it like, you know,

2742
02:42:58,250 --> 02:43:02,389
like, oh, I'm going to go have like a like a beer with this person.

2743
02:43:02,389 --> 02:43:04,229
Chandra, the catalyst.

2744
02:43:04,229 --> 02:43:04,870
Oh, wait, wait.

2745
02:43:04,870 --> 02:43:10,840
Magic or no, no, like in like the Travelers and Merchants.

2746
02:43:10,840 --> 02:43:12,360
Dream Blunt rotation.

2747
02:43:12,360 --> 02:43:13,159
Oh, OK.

2748
02:43:13,719 --> 02:43:14,040
OK.

2749
02:43:14,040 --> 02:43:14,680
Mm hmm.

2750
02:43:14,680 --> 02:43:17,909
Going you go first.

2751
02:43:17,909 --> 02:43:21,909
Yeah, I feel like that surgeon has seen some shit.

2752
02:43:21,909 --> 02:43:24,979
I would I would like to have a beer with him 100%.

2753
02:43:24,979 --> 02:43:25,940
Yeah, I can see that.

2754
02:43:25,940 --> 02:43:27,020
What will you stir?

2755
02:43:30,659 --> 02:43:31,860
I don't like any of them.

2756
02:43:32,680 --> 02:43:35,559
They all look mean and the tailor looks the meanest.

2757
02:43:35,559 --> 02:43:40,340
Like he's going to sell me some clothes with fucking razor blades in them.

2758
02:43:40,340 --> 02:43:45,379
Yeah, I maybe Valentine want to figure out, you know,

2759
02:43:45,379 --> 02:43:48,840
how he still has hope in such a hopeless world.

2760
02:43:50,020 --> 02:43:54,500
Can we talk about how the armor looks like the softest man and the hardest armor?

2761
02:43:54,500 --> 02:43:57,879
Like that man is not intimidating anybody.

2762
02:43:57,879 --> 02:44:03,049
And that is exactly why you should be afraid.

2763
02:44:03,049 --> 02:44:07,690
He's like a baby and like he's like an armored baby with a mustache.

2764
02:44:08,840 --> 02:44:12,700
Yeah, I'm picking the alchemist, the alchemist.

2765
02:44:13,260 --> 02:44:17,750
And then and then I'm going to like I'm going to like text the goblin

2766
02:44:17,750 --> 02:44:20,540
and just just to be like, oh, hey, you've like got a plan,

2767
02:44:20,540 --> 02:44:23,559
like doing some stuff just to kind of see like what he says.

2768
02:44:23,559 --> 02:44:27,770
And then I'd be able to bail like if it's like if it's a weird shit.

2769
02:44:27,770 --> 02:44:30,250
Yeah, you're going to catfish a goblin.

2770
02:44:30,250 --> 02:44:31,930
No, I'm just saying like, hey, what are you up to?

2771
02:44:31,930 --> 02:44:33,450
Like on like Thursday?

2772
02:44:33,450 --> 02:44:34,889
Well, I'm eating.

2773
02:44:34,889 --> 02:44:36,489
I'm eating flesh on.

2774
02:44:36,489 --> 02:44:37,930
It's like, OK, no, no, no, no, no.

2775
02:44:37,930 --> 02:44:38,569
I'm busy.

2776
02:44:38,569 --> 02:44:42,440
Like, yeah, I'm just getting I'm getting the lunch.

2777
02:44:42,440 --> 02:44:43,799
I don't know.

2778
02:44:43,879 --> 02:44:45,000
You wouldn't. OK.

2779
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:48,120
For real, you wouldn't eat some flesh to make a friend for life.

2780
02:44:48,120 --> 02:44:53,059
I feel like at least two or three people here probably have eaten somebody

2781
02:44:53,059 --> 02:44:54,200
in your chat.

2782
02:44:54,200 --> 02:44:57,319
No, here at least I'm going.

2783
02:44:57,319 --> 02:45:00,360
But statistically, there's a lot of people here, like maybe three people

2784
02:45:00,360 --> 02:45:02,120
at least have probably eaten someone.

2785
02:45:05,399 --> 02:45:07,959
I mean, back then, I mean, it probably wasn't, you know, like in this.

2786
02:45:07,959 --> 02:45:08,280
All right.

2787
02:45:08,280 --> 02:45:12,120
We I'm bringing a good item and let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

2788
02:45:12,120 --> 02:45:12,680
All right.

2789
02:45:12,680 --> 02:45:13,000
Yep.

2790
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,559
It's weird how the ratio works because I feel like in my chat,

2791
02:45:15,559 --> 02:45:17,319
there's probably at least five people that have eaten someone.

2792
02:45:17,319 --> 02:45:18,040
There's less.

2793
02:45:18,040 --> 02:45:21,770
That's actually like how we get inducted in my chat is we eat people together.

2794
02:45:21,770 --> 02:45:23,690
Interesting.

2795
02:45:23,690 --> 02:45:24,409
Don't do that.

2796
02:45:24,409 --> 02:45:26,600
That's very interesting.

2797
02:45:26,600 --> 02:45:30,120
Sorry, I totally forgot to buy health pots because I know the minute

2798
02:45:30,120 --> 02:45:31,559
we get in there, Creepo is going to stab me.

2799
02:45:31,559 --> 02:45:35,799
So I mean, I'm accepting the fact that no, never mind.

2800
02:45:35,799 --> 02:45:40,440
I'm not accepting any assassination contracts right now.

2801
02:45:40,440 --> 02:45:41,959
No, and guess what?

2802
02:45:41,959 --> 02:45:42,760
And guess what?

2803
02:45:42,760 --> 02:45:46,280
If there is one on me, if you got an assassination contract, one of you

2804
02:45:46,280 --> 02:45:48,680
to just be aware, I'm fighting back.

2805
02:45:48,680 --> 02:45:49,399
I just want you to know.

2806
02:45:50,040 --> 02:45:53,319
I am not joining the Dark Brotherhood.

2807
02:45:53,319 --> 02:45:57,639
Yeah, honestly, I got to say you didn't do shit when he was just

2808
02:45:57,639 --> 02:45:59,479
literally stabbing you in your corneas.

2809
02:46:00,360 --> 02:46:02,040
You really just accepted it.

2810
02:46:02,040 --> 02:46:03,639
You look kind of dead stared at me.

2811
02:46:03,639 --> 02:46:05,559
We're like, this is, it's happening.

2812
02:46:05,559 --> 02:46:07,159
I wanted you to feel bad.

2813
02:46:07,159 --> 02:46:08,420
I wanted you to be like.

2814
02:46:08,420 --> 02:46:11,940
It's crazy how I don't at all.

2815
02:46:11,940 --> 02:46:16,700
Like I really got pushed there and I saw it in your face.

2816
02:46:16,700 --> 02:46:17,899
Didn't flinch.

2817
02:46:20,200 --> 02:46:21,079
Were you just shocked?

2818
02:46:21,079 --> 02:46:23,079
Like what was going through your mind at that time?

2819
02:46:23,959 --> 02:46:24,840
We're just playing the game.

2820
02:46:25,319 --> 02:46:26,840
And watch out for the spider behind you.

2821
02:46:26,840 --> 02:46:29,110
Oh, oh, oh, okay.

2822
02:46:29,110 --> 02:46:29,829
I'm body blocked.

2823
02:46:29,829 --> 02:46:30,069
Okay.

2824
02:46:30,069 --> 02:46:35,139
I can't move.

2825
02:46:35,139 --> 02:46:37,620
Can you there's I think I dropped a dagger for you.

2826
02:46:38,180 --> 02:46:39,530
Is there one here?

2827
02:46:39,530 --> 02:46:40,030
Yeah.

2828
02:46:41,819 --> 02:46:42,700
Honest to goodness.

2829
02:46:42,700 --> 02:46:43,739
Let's play.

2830
02:46:43,739 --> 02:46:55,819
Let's play, everyone.

2831
02:46:55,819 --> 02:46:55,979
All right.

2832
02:46:55,979 --> 02:46:56,540
We got to kill that.

2833
02:46:56,540 --> 02:46:57,819
We got to kill a spider spawner.

2834
02:46:59,000 --> 02:46:59,799
Oh, oh, beautiful.

2835
02:46:59,799 --> 02:47:00,440
I can see now.

2836
02:47:00,440 --> 02:47:01,000
I can see now.

2837
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:01,719
This is huge.

2838
02:47:01,719 --> 02:47:09,129
The dewormer flushed out all of his feelings.

2839
02:47:12,329 --> 02:47:13,930
Yeah, they're in the diaper now.

2840
02:47:13,930 --> 02:47:15,690
Oh, beautiful hop, beautiful hop.

2841
02:47:15,690 --> 02:47:16,329
Exquisite.

2842
02:47:16,329 --> 02:47:16,729
Thank you.

2843
02:47:17,370 --> 02:47:19,290
The worms were what made me me.

2844
02:47:21,500 --> 02:47:23,659
Oh, that was the good old one, two combo.

2845
02:47:24,520 --> 02:47:25,860
Look at that.

2846
02:47:25,860 --> 02:47:27,219
The one to buckle my shoe.

2847
02:47:27,219 --> 02:47:28,260
I love the long sword, by the way.

2848
02:47:28,260 --> 02:47:29,059
It's my favorite weapon.

2849
02:47:29,059 --> 02:47:29,860
I jumped.

2850
02:47:29,860 --> 02:47:32,180
I jumped over the corner of this and it's still activated.

2851
02:47:32,180 --> 02:47:33,860
I'm refunding this game.

2852
02:47:33,860 --> 02:47:34,500
That's actually.

2853
02:47:34,500 --> 02:47:37,139
Oh, you jumped on that like a trampoline.

2854
02:47:37,139 --> 02:47:37,700
I know.

2855
02:47:37,700 --> 02:47:38,739
I just wanted to.

2856
02:47:38,739 --> 02:47:40,100
I could have walked a long way.

2857
02:47:40,100 --> 02:47:41,379
Here's an army sword for you, by the way.

2858
02:47:41,379 --> 02:47:42,500
If you want a one hand.

2859
02:47:44,739 --> 02:47:46,309
All right.

2860
02:47:46,309 --> 02:47:49,829
There are friends directly to our south.

2861
02:47:49,829 --> 02:47:51,290
There's a wizard in the room.

2862
02:47:51,290 --> 02:47:53,000
A wizard.

2863
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:54,120
Oh, oh, God.

2864
02:47:54,600 --> 02:47:56,260
OK, hold on.

2865
02:47:56,260 --> 02:47:57,610
We can go this way.

2866
02:47:57,610 --> 02:47:58,569
Yeah, I can stun.

2867
02:47:58,569 --> 02:47:59,209
I can stun them.

2868
02:48:01,049 --> 02:48:09,690
I'll pay you 15 V bucks if you kill stir.

2869
02:48:10,409 --> 02:48:12,569
Now, I'm not taking any contracts right now.

2870
02:48:13,530 --> 02:48:14,010
Or ever.

2871
02:48:19,180 --> 02:48:21,420
Boys, if you take health, we can go back to that healing shrine

2872
02:48:21,420 --> 02:48:27,479
at the beginning of the level.

2873
02:48:27,479 --> 02:48:28,280
I said nice.

2874
02:48:28,280 --> 02:48:28,520
Nice.

2875
02:48:28,520 --> 02:48:29,559
Oh, that.

2876
02:48:29,559 --> 02:48:31,639
OK, I didn't know that was the second part of the swing.

2877
02:48:31,639 --> 02:48:35,239
You kind of really styled with it here.

2878
02:48:35,239 --> 02:48:35,719
I got you.

2879
02:48:35,719 --> 02:48:36,920
I got you a beautiful little helmet.

2880
02:48:36,920 --> 02:48:38,100
Check this out.

2881
02:48:38,100 --> 02:48:41,940
Protect that noggin from facial stabs.

2882
02:48:42,020 --> 02:48:44,180
All right, pretty good.

2883
02:48:44,180 --> 02:48:44,579
Thank you.

2884
02:48:45,219 --> 02:48:47,500
I'm going down the secret tunnel.

2885
02:48:47,500 --> 02:48:49,799
Secret tunnel.

2886
02:48:49,799 --> 02:48:58,409
There were friends down here.

2887
02:48:58,409 --> 02:49:02,180
Oh, it's all blocked up right here.

2888
02:49:02,180 --> 02:49:10,360
Oh, I can't even hit it because this guy's just standing on the spikes.

2889
02:49:10,360 --> 02:49:13,879
That's so sweet of him to take that damage for us.

2890
02:49:13,879 --> 02:49:14,760
Oh, he killed a player.

2891
02:49:14,760 --> 02:49:15,959
That's so sad.

2892
02:49:15,959 --> 02:49:19,959
Oh, oh, this guy is armored.

2893
02:49:19,959 --> 02:49:21,639
That's not watch out for the orb.

2894
02:49:24,659 --> 02:49:25,620
This is really fun.

2895
02:49:25,620 --> 02:49:29,129
I actually really like this weapon of the long sword.

2896
02:49:29,129 --> 02:49:31,770
Yeah, you can you can block with it and you can get a parry off.

2897
02:49:31,770 --> 02:49:34,569
Sir, do you want to get this hat that I just put on the ground?

2898
02:49:34,569 --> 02:49:40,870
It's a guy in.

2899
02:49:40,870 --> 02:49:42,379
OK, thank you.

2900
02:49:44,950 --> 02:49:46,950
There's a chest that we didn't loot over here.

2901
02:49:47,670 --> 02:49:51,110
If you guys I was in the middle of it, but then he offered.

2902
02:49:51,110 --> 02:49:51,590
I got it.

2903
02:49:52,389 --> 02:49:53,750
It's my I hate.

2904
02:49:53,750 --> 02:49:55,110
I'm going to still do it fast.

2905
02:49:57,110 --> 02:49:58,149
I'm keeping it closed.

2906
02:49:58,149 --> 02:49:59,270
I'm keeping it closed.

2907
02:49:59,270 --> 02:50:01,510
I'm RP opening it with one finger.

2908
02:50:01,510 --> 02:50:02,229
Oh, my goodness.

2909
02:50:02,229 --> 02:50:04,790
You got launched.

2910
02:50:04,790 --> 02:50:08,329
You made a trebuchet out of a that was awful.

2911
02:50:08,329 --> 02:50:08,969
And what are these?

2912
02:50:08,969 --> 02:50:12,649
What are these sacrifices to resurrect player?

2913
02:50:12,649 --> 02:50:13,540
Yeah.

2914
02:50:13,540 --> 02:50:14,579
Oh, OK.

2915
02:50:16,700 --> 02:50:17,659
There's another big chest.

2916
02:50:17,659 --> 02:50:20,219
I'm going to, you know, I'm just going to go over here real quick.

2917
02:50:20,219 --> 02:50:22,059
Oh, I don't have the lock.

2918
02:50:22,059 --> 02:50:23,020
You take these.

2919
02:50:23,020 --> 02:50:25,739
Oh, you're right.

2920
02:50:27,180 --> 02:50:28,569
Big enemy.

2921
02:50:28,569 --> 02:50:29,129
Oh, yeah.

2922
02:50:29,129 --> 02:50:30,459
Come to us.

2923
02:50:30,459 --> 02:50:31,989
I can't get them.

2924
02:50:31,989 --> 02:50:32,309
Yeah.

2925
02:50:32,309 --> 02:50:32,790
Fuck you.

2926
02:50:34,069 --> 02:50:35,780
All right.

2927
02:50:35,780 --> 02:50:36,340
Close the door.

2928
02:50:45,930 --> 02:50:46,649
Good one, guys.

2929
02:50:47,209 --> 02:50:48,889
You really had me going.

2930
02:50:48,889 --> 02:50:49,450
Oh, my God.

2931
02:50:49,450 --> 02:50:50,329
I can't swing in here.

2932
02:50:50,329 --> 02:50:51,450
I have to crouch and swing.

2933
02:50:51,450 --> 02:50:52,010
That's so sad.

2934
02:51:01,559 --> 02:51:02,360
Wait, I think there's.

2935
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:03,559
Oh, yeah.

2936
02:51:03,559 --> 02:51:04,440
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

2937
02:51:04,440 --> 02:51:05,239
Uh, help.

2938
02:51:05,239 --> 02:51:05,559
All right.

2939
02:51:05,559 --> 02:51:08,040
We have to kill these Rangers first, otherwise we're going to get screwed over.

2940
02:51:15,659 --> 02:51:16,459
Ranger top left.

2941
02:51:17,579 --> 02:51:17,979
Oh, my.

2942
02:51:17,979 --> 02:51:19,340
You guys are still on the mummy.

2943
02:51:20,459 --> 02:51:22,219
That was just like you.

2944
02:51:22,219 --> 02:51:24,620
That was just so funny looking over here.

2945
02:51:24,620 --> 02:51:25,500
Talking strategy.

2946
02:51:25,500 --> 02:51:27,500
You guys are over there playing patty cake with the zombie.

2947
02:51:27,500 --> 02:51:32,219
And I wouldn't trade it for the world.

2948
02:51:33,180 --> 02:51:34,139
You boys are the world to me.

2949
02:51:35,020 --> 02:51:35,500
Thank you.

2950
02:51:36,299 --> 02:51:37,579
What the gas?

2951
02:51:37,579 --> 02:51:38,059
Come on.

2952
02:51:38,860 --> 02:51:41,690
Do I have any help for healing?

2953
02:51:41,690 --> 02:51:42,659
No.

2954
02:51:42,659 --> 02:51:43,940
There's a healing shrine right behind you.

2955
02:51:45,510 --> 02:51:46,149
Oh, there it is.

2956
02:51:46,149 --> 02:51:47,110
Where we came from.

2957
02:51:47,110 --> 02:51:48,389
I thought somebody used it.

2958
02:51:49,829 --> 02:51:50,950
I was tempted.

2959
02:51:50,950 --> 02:51:52,309
You should probably use it.

2960
02:51:52,309 --> 02:51:53,829
Can you whirlwind or something?

2961
02:51:53,829 --> 02:51:55,829
I have a whirlwind.

2962
02:51:55,829 --> 02:51:58,069
What is this?

2963
02:51:58,069 --> 02:51:59,829
Everybody, just calm down.

2964
02:51:59,829 --> 02:52:00,709
Just calm down.

2965
02:52:00,709 --> 02:52:01,270
I'm thinking.

2966
02:52:02,549 --> 02:52:02,870
Boom.

2967
02:52:02,870 --> 02:52:03,430
There we go.

2968
02:52:03,430 --> 02:52:03,750
Kill him.

2969
02:52:07,510 --> 02:52:08,069
Oh, shit.

2970
02:52:08,870 --> 02:52:11,579
I don't like daggers.

2971
02:52:11,579 --> 02:52:14,280
Not a dagger guy.

2972
02:52:16,860 --> 02:52:17,819
They're so short range.

2973
02:52:18,780 --> 02:52:19,100
Yeah.

2974
02:52:20,680 --> 02:52:22,760
Some say it's not the size of the sword.

2975
02:52:22,760 --> 02:52:24,440
It's the motion of the blade.

2976
02:52:24,440 --> 02:52:26,659
There's a lot of enemies right now.

2977
02:52:26,659 --> 02:52:27,079
Yeah.

2978
02:52:27,079 --> 02:52:28,360
You guys are getting tons of XP, you know.

2979
02:52:33,180 --> 02:52:35,540
There's a purple V hander.

2980
02:52:35,540 --> 02:52:36,100
No, there's not.

2981
02:52:36,100 --> 02:52:37,620
Oh, there is.

2982
02:52:37,620 --> 02:52:39,059
No, there's not.

2983
02:52:39,059 --> 02:52:39,540
Where is it?

2984
02:52:39,540 --> 02:52:40,340
On the floor right here.

2985
02:52:40,899 --> 02:52:42,020
Redemption arc.

2986
02:52:42,020 --> 02:52:42,500
No way.

2987
02:52:45,700 --> 02:52:46,979
Up on the chest up here.

2988
02:52:46,979 --> 02:52:48,739
Oh, now you can see it, right?

2989
02:52:48,739 --> 02:52:49,540
Holy shit.

2990
02:52:49,540 --> 02:52:51,059
Can you see it when I turn that off?

2991
02:52:51,059 --> 02:52:52,260
Oh, my goodness.

2992
02:52:54,979 --> 02:52:56,340
We got any campfires in here?

2993
02:52:56,899 --> 02:52:57,700
I have one on me.

2994
02:52:57,700 --> 02:52:58,180
Yep.

2995
02:52:58,180 --> 02:52:58,979
Here, if you want to take it

2996
02:52:58,979 --> 02:53:01,459
because it'll actually take me four years to set it up.

2997
02:53:01,459 --> 02:53:02,979
It'll be 2024.

2998
02:53:02,979 --> 02:53:03,299
Holy shit.

2999
02:53:03,299 --> 02:53:04,739
The beta test will be over.

3000
02:53:04,739 --> 02:53:06,549
This thing is insane.

3001
02:53:06,549 --> 02:53:11,879
I thought I heard movement.

3002
02:53:11,879 --> 02:53:12,440
Yes, I did.

3003
02:53:12,440 --> 02:53:13,239
Oh, we're fucked.

3004
02:53:13,239 --> 02:53:15,879
We know we got to get out of here.

3005
02:53:15,879 --> 02:53:17,479
You picked the wrong time.

3006
02:53:18,360 --> 02:53:19,000
Oh, don't you?

3007
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:19,559
No, come on.

3008
02:53:19,559 --> 02:53:20,040
Come on.

3009
02:53:20,040 --> 02:53:30,219
Oh, sorry.

3010
02:53:30,219 --> 02:53:30,940
Behind you.

3011
02:53:30,940 --> 02:53:31,420
German knife.

3012
02:53:31,420 --> 02:53:32,059
Oh, my God.

3013
02:53:33,100 --> 02:53:33,819
The darkness.

3014
02:53:33,819 --> 02:53:34,860
I killed him.

3015
02:53:34,940 --> 02:53:36,840
I killed him.

3016
02:53:36,840 --> 02:53:38,200
Oh, God, dude.

3017
02:53:38,200 --> 02:53:39,559
I was just trying to be the light.

3018
02:53:39,559 --> 02:53:40,280
I'm going to die.

3019
02:53:41,540 --> 02:53:42,739
No, no, no, you're not.

3020
02:53:42,739 --> 02:53:43,299
No, you're not.

3021
02:53:43,299 --> 02:53:43,780
Stay with me.

3022
02:53:43,780 --> 02:53:46,229
Stay with me.

3023
02:53:46,229 --> 02:53:47,909
Dedicated light boy.

3024
02:53:47,909 --> 02:53:50,149
Honestly, if I had taken that torch down,

3025
02:53:50,149 --> 02:53:51,670
we may have actually lost that.

3026
02:53:51,670 --> 02:53:52,469
Oh, here you go.

3027
02:53:52,469 --> 02:53:53,110
Here you go.

3028
02:53:53,110 --> 02:53:53,590
Take this.

3029
02:53:53,590 --> 02:53:56,729
Well, it's only one person here has night vision.

3030
02:53:56,729 --> 02:53:57,610
It's not me.

3031
02:53:57,610 --> 02:54:03,979
Well, yeah, yeah.

3032
02:54:03,979 --> 02:54:05,100
Look, I just look.

3033
02:54:05,100 --> 02:54:06,700
I just fucked your friends over.

3034
02:54:06,700 --> 02:54:07,659
Do not come down here.

3035
02:54:07,659 --> 02:54:10,709
I swear to God on everything, brother, brother.

3036
02:54:10,709 --> 02:54:11,030
All right.

3037
02:54:11,590 --> 02:54:13,190
You do not want this smoke, dude.

3038
02:54:13,190 --> 02:54:14,069
I'm not coming down there.

3039
02:54:14,069 --> 02:54:15,590
Just don't leave me alone.

3040
02:54:15,590 --> 02:54:16,309
Leave us alone.

3041
02:54:16,309 --> 02:54:17,399
Look at that strap.

3042
02:54:17,399 --> 02:54:20,760
All right.

3043
02:54:24,469 --> 02:54:25,750
You have a wonderful evening.

3044
02:54:25,750 --> 02:54:27,270
No, the campfire went out.

3045
02:54:27,270 --> 02:54:28,870
The campfire just went out.

3046
02:54:28,870 --> 02:54:29,750
What the fuck?

3047
02:54:30,469 --> 02:54:31,350
I'm running away.

3048
02:54:31,350 --> 02:54:36,600
Dude, he was like, I'm literally right in front of you.

3049
02:54:36,600 --> 02:54:40,040
I was trying to do like, I was trying to do like, oh, yeah.

3050
02:54:40,040 --> 02:54:42,360
Like, oh, man, I'm so scared of you, man.

3051
02:54:42,360 --> 02:54:43,799
And like, oh, shit, that guy must be.

3052
02:54:43,799 --> 02:54:47,239
He must have beat that guy's friends.

3053
02:54:47,239 --> 02:54:47,879
God damn it.

3054
02:54:47,879 --> 02:54:49,319
I was I was so concerned.

3055
02:54:49,319 --> 02:54:49,799
All right.

3056
02:54:49,799 --> 02:54:50,120
Fuck.

3057
02:54:50,120 --> 02:54:51,000
This is a cool item.

3058
02:54:54,629 --> 02:54:55,430
He's going to come around.

3059
02:54:55,430 --> 02:54:56,469
I was.

3060
02:54:56,469 --> 02:54:57,270
Oh, my.

3061
02:54:57,270 --> 02:54:58,870
Oh, my mother of pearl.

3062
02:54:58,870 --> 02:54:59,350
Come on.

3063
02:55:02,540 --> 02:55:03,739
Healing healing shrine.

3064
02:55:03,739 --> 02:55:06,280
Oh, that's nice.

3065
02:55:07,500 --> 02:55:08,299
Yeah, you should take that.

3066
02:55:09,180 --> 02:55:13,180
Yeah.

3067
02:55:13,180 --> 02:55:17,899
The strategy was I wanted them to think you were talking to my group

3068
02:55:17,899 --> 02:55:20,059
and that you were very strong and to not come down here.

3069
02:55:20,059 --> 02:55:20,780
We got it.

3070
02:55:20,780 --> 02:55:21,180
We got it.

3071
02:55:21,180 --> 02:55:22,379
Yeah, it was clever.

3072
02:55:24,139 --> 02:55:25,579
My knowledge is six.

3073
02:55:25,579 --> 02:55:27,340
In RP, I didn't understand that.

3074
02:55:27,340 --> 02:55:30,489
But somebody asked in chat.

3075
02:55:30,489 --> 02:55:31,209
Out of character.

3076
02:55:31,209 --> 02:55:32,010
I definitely.

3077
02:55:32,010 --> 02:55:35,110
Oh, well, OK.

3078
02:55:35,110 --> 02:55:36,629
Somebody said, what the fuck happened, bro?

3079
02:55:36,629 --> 02:55:37,510
And I was explaining it.

3080
02:55:42,950 --> 02:55:43,510
All right.

3081
02:55:43,510 --> 02:55:45,190
I think there's two portals here.

3082
02:55:45,190 --> 02:55:45,430
Nice.

3083
02:55:45,430 --> 02:55:45,909
See you later.

3084
02:55:47,270 --> 02:55:48,389
Doosies.

3085
02:55:48,389 --> 02:55:48,950
Oh, my God.

3086
02:55:48,950 --> 02:55:50,069
This is actually crazy.

3087
02:55:53,850 --> 02:55:54,170
Come on.

3088
02:55:55,510 --> 02:55:55,989
You guys.

3089
02:55:55,989 --> 02:55:56,870
You guys are leaving.

3090
02:55:57,739 --> 02:55:57,899
Yeah.

3091
02:55:57,899 --> 02:55:58,059
Yeah.

3092
02:55:58,059 --> 02:56:00,219
100% You guys are leaving, huh?

3093
02:56:00,219 --> 02:56:03,020
I I got a purple is way under, man.

3094
02:56:03,020 --> 02:56:04,700
This way under arc is just beginning.

3095
02:56:04,700 --> 02:56:05,180
I'm sorry.

3096
02:56:05,180 --> 02:56:05,659
I had to leave.

3097
02:56:06,379 --> 02:56:07,420
No, I understand.

3098
02:56:09,079 --> 02:56:11,399
You're a what was that movie?

3099
02:56:11,399 --> 02:56:13,510
Uh, oh, my God.

3100
02:56:13,510 --> 02:56:15,270
I cannot believe I'm blanking on this movie.

3101
02:56:15,270 --> 02:56:15,989
There can only be one.

3102
02:56:15,989 --> 02:56:16,950
What's that movie?

3103
02:56:16,950 --> 02:56:18,229
I know you know what I'm talking about.

3104
02:56:18,229 --> 02:56:19,770
It can only be one.

3105
02:56:20,489 --> 02:56:22,489
Yeah.

3106
02:56:22,489 --> 02:56:22,729
What?

3107
02:56:23,610 --> 02:56:24,629
Highlander.

3108
02:56:25,190 --> 02:56:26,149
Yes, the Highlander.

3109
02:56:26,149 --> 02:56:30,809
You're a cardigan now for a Kerrigan.

3110
02:56:30,809 --> 02:56:32,809
I'm literally right in front of you, dude.

3111
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:39,959
How close was he to me?

3112
02:56:40,440 --> 02:56:45,459
Honestly, I feel like he was literally right in front of my like model.

3113
02:56:45,459 --> 02:56:46,100
That was nuts.

3114
02:56:47,379 --> 02:56:48,659
I don't really know where to go.

3115
02:56:49,219 --> 02:56:49,459
All right.

3116
02:56:49,459 --> 02:56:49,940
Here's the plan.

3117
02:56:49,940 --> 02:56:50,260
Here's the plan.

3118
02:56:50,260 --> 02:56:52,260
What you're going to do is just take the red portal.

3119
02:56:52,260 --> 02:56:53,530
No, I'm just kidding.

3120
02:56:53,530 --> 02:56:57,540
Um, I just don't want to waste you guys' time.

3121
02:56:58,100 --> 02:57:01,500
No, you don't want to take the red.

3122
02:57:01,500 --> 02:57:04,860
I just clicked what kind of just happened in the last five minutes.

3123
02:57:04,860 --> 02:57:08,389
And I just I just realized what happened.

3124
02:57:08,389 --> 02:57:09,350
Uh, do not do.

3125
02:57:09,350 --> 02:57:10,069
What are you doing?

3126
02:57:10,069 --> 02:57:10,629
What?

3127
02:57:10,629 --> 02:57:12,100
Why do you do this?

3128
02:57:12,100 --> 02:57:12,260
What?

3129
02:57:12,260 --> 02:57:13,540
What are you doing?

3130
02:57:13,540 --> 02:57:14,180
What's going on?

3131
02:57:14,180 --> 02:57:15,059
What's he doing?

3132
02:57:15,059 --> 02:57:17,299
He's causing himself damage to cause me stress.

3133
02:57:23,540 --> 02:57:24,500
There's nowhere to go.

3134
02:57:25,139 --> 02:57:26,340
Nothing will rival.

3135
02:57:26,340 --> 02:57:29,610
You literally avoided the circle just to.

3136
02:57:29,610 --> 02:57:30,409
That was amazing.

3137
02:57:31,450 --> 02:57:34,329
I was just taking a fucking walk around the park.

3138
02:57:34,329 --> 02:57:34,969
Yes.

3139
02:57:34,969 --> 02:57:35,290
Yes.

3140
02:57:36,409 --> 02:57:39,020
All right.

3141
02:57:39,020 --> 02:57:40,139
I got another stiletto for you.

3142
02:57:40,139 --> 02:57:40,540
Luckily.

3143
02:57:42,760 --> 02:57:43,719
He's my last one.

3144
02:57:44,760 --> 02:57:46,889
I know I'm going to buy you one at this point though.

3145
02:57:48,090 --> 02:57:49,209
I could buy one.

3146
02:57:49,209 --> 02:57:49,850
I have a short story.

3147
02:57:50,409 --> 02:57:51,530
It's not selling any.

3148
02:57:51,530 --> 02:57:52,809
Sir, I have a blue short sword.

3149
02:57:55,030 --> 02:57:58,950
I mean, I got a really good short sword from someone in that game and then I died.

3150
02:57:58,950 --> 02:58:00,520
Well, I have one for you.

3151
02:58:00,520 --> 02:58:01,559
And it was your fault.

3152
02:58:02,120 --> 02:58:04,040
OK, I'm ready.

3153
02:58:04,040 --> 02:58:06,459
What if we all just clicked ready and just went again?

3154
02:58:07,180 --> 02:58:08,540
I still have gear.

3155
02:58:08,540 --> 02:58:10,780
I'm sorry, stuff to sell.

3156
02:58:10,780 --> 02:58:10,940
Yeah.

3157
02:58:10,940 --> 02:58:16,469
OK, well, then I'm going to have to go on some like psycho tangent if we don't go right now.

3158
02:58:16,469 --> 02:58:17,030
Oh, God.

3159
02:58:17,030 --> 02:58:17,909
Oh, he's doing it.

3160
02:58:19,110 --> 02:58:19,989
It's the dewormer.

3161
02:58:20,469 --> 02:58:21,030
Oh, my God.

3162
02:58:21,030 --> 02:58:21,350
OK.

3163
02:58:21,350 --> 02:58:22,069
Just stir.

3164
02:58:22,069 --> 02:58:24,139
Just wait a second, please.

3165
02:58:24,139 --> 02:58:25,260
I'm just I'm just putting it in.

3166
02:58:25,260 --> 02:58:26,870
I'm just I'm just.

3167
02:58:26,870 --> 02:58:27,270
Oh, sir.

3168
02:58:27,270 --> 02:58:28,389
How do you feel about people subs?

3169
02:58:28,389 --> 02:58:28,709
They go.

3170
02:58:30,389 --> 02:58:30,870
Distract.

3171
02:58:30,870 --> 02:58:34,389
That's a meatball firehouse subs.

3172
02:58:34,389 --> 02:58:34,950
They make subs.

3173
02:58:34,950 --> 02:58:35,909
They make a meatball sub.

3174
02:58:35,909 --> 02:58:37,270
Sometimes they get their meatball sub.

3175
02:58:37,270 --> 02:58:37,829
It's OK.

3176
02:58:38,870 --> 02:58:39,590
It's pretty good.

3177
02:58:39,590 --> 02:58:41,510
I think it's pretty safe everywhere.

3178
02:58:41,510 --> 02:58:43,110
Most meatballs are too big, though.

3179
02:58:45,510 --> 02:58:46,549
Yeah, I can understand.

3180
02:58:46,549 --> 02:58:51,829
And there's always the one like cartoon spaghetti plate with one giant meatball on it.

3181
02:58:52,780 --> 02:58:55,340
And you know, in the center of that meatball is like an ice cube.

3182
02:58:55,340 --> 02:58:57,909
That's actually kind of true.

3183
02:58:59,540 --> 02:59:00,340
Interesting.

3184
02:59:00,340 --> 02:59:02,889
Yeah, no, I know what you mean.

3185
02:59:02,889 --> 02:59:07,450
I like, you know, Subway, the subway meatball sub.

3186
02:59:07,450 --> 02:59:11,209
I haven't had it in a while, but they have like the perfect size meatballs.

3187
02:59:11,209 --> 02:59:13,530
They're pretty good.

3188
02:59:13,530 --> 02:59:15,049
My worms are really like that one.

3189
02:59:15,049 --> 02:59:19,899
Have you named your worms?

3190
02:59:21,159 --> 02:59:22,280
There's way too many.

3191
02:59:22,280 --> 02:59:24,149
That's huge.

3192
02:59:24,149 --> 02:59:25,030
I'm proud of you.

3193
02:59:25,030 --> 02:59:26,389
It sounds like a healthy colony.

3194
02:59:26,389 --> 02:59:29,829
Sir, I got a short sword.

3195
02:59:29,829 --> 02:59:36,329
I mean, if you're looking to lose weight, got a couple of tips for you.

3196
02:59:37,209 --> 02:59:41,979
You're actually talking to somebody that's very like in the nutrition and fucking fitness world.

3197
02:59:41,979 --> 02:59:45,940
Both of you could probably talk to each other and, you know, level.

3198
02:59:45,940 --> 02:59:48,420
Oh, well, my suggestion was to get worms.

3199
02:59:48,420 --> 02:59:50,979
Yeah, well, I prefer just a worm like a tapeworm.

3200
02:59:50,979 --> 02:59:54,739
You know, that way it's like easier to just get that one out.

3201
02:59:54,739 --> 02:59:57,799
But hey, I feel like I don't know.

3202
02:59:57,799 --> 03:00:01,399
It wasn't a trend for a while to get tapeworms to help people lose weight.

3203
03:00:01,399 --> 03:00:03,959
I hope that sounds like something that could have happened.

3204
03:00:03,959 --> 03:00:07,319
My big business plan, if I ever really make it and, you know, have some money to invest.

3205
03:00:07,319 --> 03:00:08,760
No, don't let him cook here.

3206
03:00:09,239 --> 03:00:12,120
He's going to be having LSD drug chairs at a movie theater.

3207
03:00:12,120 --> 03:00:13,850
Don't let him cook.

3208
03:00:13,850 --> 03:00:17,129
I was going to start talking about putting people in comas for weight loss.

3209
03:00:17,129 --> 03:00:17,610
All right.

3210
03:00:17,610 --> 03:00:21,690
If you're ever just really bored and you're like waiting for the new like a new game to come out

3211
03:00:21,690 --> 03:00:24,860
and you want to lose some weight, just put you in a coma for like a month.

3212
03:00:24,860 --> 03:00:26,620
Eric Cartman did that in South Park.

3213
03:00:27,340 --> 03:00:27,819
Oh, did he?

3214
03:00:29,500 --> 03:00:32,819
Could you imagine, though, like the amount of.

3215
03:00:32,819 --> 03:00:34,340
There's a lot of shit in this room.

3216
03:00:35,219 --> 03:00:36,739
I'm just thinking, well, yeah, hold on.

3217
03:00:36,739 --> 03:00:37,780
Let me stun him, let me stun him.

3218
03:00:38,500 --> 03:00:39,159
There we go.

3219
03:00:39,159 --> 03:00:39,639
Just kill him.

3220
03:00:41,290 --> 03:00:43,930
I was just thinking, like, what would they do with all like this?

3221
03:00:43,930 --> 03:00:46,170
Because because people in coma, don't they still defecate?

3222
03:00:47,290 --> 03:00:48,250
Like, I don't know.

3223
03:00:50,170 --> 03:00:53,290
I've never looked at the logistics of being in a coma.

3224
03:00:53,290 --> 03:00:55,850
You're going to need like a nurse to take care of you.

3225
03:00:56,489 --> 03:00:59,290
Like, can you imagine how many new jobs be created just from having like

3226
03:00:59,290 --> 03:01:01,530
handle the the waste of people in a coma from that?

3227
03:01:01,530 --> 03:01:03,049
That might be a brilliant job.

3228
03:01:03,049 --> 03:01:06,520
Like, hey, I'm a weight loss shit technician.

3229
03:01:06,520 --> 03:01:08,360
Basically, I didn't let either one of them cook.

3230
03:01:08,360 --> 03:01:09,639
I'm not even in the kitchen right now.

3231
03:01:09,639 --> 03:01:13,209
I'm just saying that like Eric Cartman did this for a game console, didn't he?

3232
03:01:13,209 --> 03:01:13,690
You know what?

3233
03:01:13,690 --> 03:01:16,250
You want to know something about you, German, that maybe you haven't noticed

3234
03:01:16,250 --> 03:01:22,090
is every time I played with you in a group, you shut down everyone else's conversations.

3235
03:01:22,090 --> 03:01:25,370
Yeah, we're trying to talk about like shit in a coma.

3236
03:01:25,370 --> 03:01:25,610
Yeah.

3237
03:01:25,610 --> 03:01:26,809
And you're like, oh, I don't know.

3238
03:01:28,729 --> 03:01:29,690
Oh, scary.

3239
03:01:29,690 --> 03:01:31,290
You look out for that stir.

3240
03:01:31,290 --> 03:01:32,250
Look out.

3241
03:01:32,250 --> 03:01:34,280
That's my first one.

3242
03:01:34,280 --> 03:01:35,079
Oh, that's true.

3243
03:01:35,879 --> 03:01:37,399
It kind of did catch me off guard.

3244
03:01:37,399 --> 03:01:48,969
Man, so are you saying there's no like plausibility, like it's not plausible

3245
03:01:48,969 --> 03:01:53,129
that you could have a shitting like like profession, a shit handler?

3246
03:01:53,129 --> 03:01:54,170
Is that what you're saying?

3247
03:01:54,170 --> 03:01:56,709
I mean, are the realm of possibilities?

3248
03:01:56,709 --> 03:01:57,829
I feel like it could happen.

3249
03:01:57,829 --> 03:01:58,549
Anything is possible.

3250
03:01:58,549 --> 03:01:59,030
Check this out.

3251
03:01:59,030 --> 03:01:59,909
Check this out, boys.

3252
03:01:59,909 --> 03:02:01,270
I got a secret tunnel for you.

3253
03:02:01,270 --> 03:02:03,190
Come to come to Papa's secret tunnel.

3254
03:02:03,190 --> 03:02:06,870
Stand on the square.

3255
03:02:06,870 --> 03:02:07,989
Secret tunnel.

3256
03:02:07,989 --> 03:02:08,549
I'm not doing that.

3257
03:02:08,549 --> 03:02:10,229
It's going to be like a trap door.

3258
03:02:10,229 --> 03:02:12,549
Yeah, I've gone to Papa's secret tunnel before.

3259
03:02:12,549 --> 03:02:12,950
Come on.

3260
03:02:13,590 --> 03:02:14,469
Come on, dude.

3261
03:02:14,469 --> 03:02:15,510
Don't be weird.

3262
03:02:15,510 --> 03:02:19,020
Oh, there is actually stuff down here.

3263
03:02:19,020 --> 03:02:20,700
Jesus, we've made it this far together.

3264
03:02:20,700 --> 03:02:22,620
Is it worth it to do the pickaxe stuff?

3265
03:02:23,420 --> 03:02:29,739
I tried it and then I got annoyed when it took so long and I died to a interaction speed.

3266
03:02:29,739 --> 03:02:32,329
Change that in theory.

3267
03:02:32,329 --> 03:02:33,219
Yeah.

3268
03:02:33,219 --> 03:02:33,700
Oh, my God.

3269
03:02:33,700 --> 03:02:34,100
I can see.

3270
03:02:34,899 --> 03:02:44,309
Oh, my God.

3271
03:02:44,309 --> 03:02:45,030
You're doing great.

3272
03:02:45,030 --> 03:02:46,149
You're waxing with the longsword.

3273
03:02:46,149 --> 03:02:46,950
Look at this guy.

3274
03:02:46,950 --> 03:02:47,430
Oh, my God.

3275
03:02:47,430 --> 03:02:48,629
Look at the finesse.

3276
03:02:49,430 --> 03:02:50,229
I love this thing.

3277
03:02:50,229 --> 03:02:51,350
This thing's actually really fun.

3278
03:02:51,989 --> 03:02:52,549
Isn't it?

3279
03:02:52,549 --> 03:02:52,790
Yeah.

3280
03:02:54,149 --> 03:02:55,590
Oh, look at that.

3281
03:02:55,590 --> 03:02:56,389
That was fun.

3282
03:03:00,680 --> 03:03:01,079
Diamond.

3283
03:03:03,819 --> 03:03:07,340
I'm going to let the record show that the next time the lights go off

3284
03:03:07,340 --> 03:03:09,659
and I'm fighting somebody, I'm just not even going to swing anymore.

3285
03:03:11,319 --> 03:03:12,920
Actually, I got two diamonds.

3286
03:03:12,920 --> 03:03:13,399
Holy shit.

3287
03:03:16,549 --> 03:03:18,069
Don't people do that at nursing homes?

3288
03:03:18,069 --> 03:03:19,110
In theory, yes.

3289
03:03:19,110 --> 03:03:22,950
But I'm saying like specifically like because you put more people in comas to lose weight,

3290
03:03:22,950 --> 03:03:23,110
right?

3291
03:03:23,110 --> 03:03:25,190
A lot of people need to lose weight or want to lose weight.

3292
03:03:25,190 --> 03:03:28,870
You're going to have a large amount of shit on your hands.

3293
03:03:28,870 --> 03:03:29,590
Literally.

3294
03:03:29,590 --> 03:03:33,620
Well, I'm typing there's just one guy who's the shit guy.

3295
03:03:34,500 --> 03:03:36,979
Yeah, I'm typing in the group chat, guys.

3296
03:03:36,979 --> 03:03:37,700
Why not me?

3297
03:03:39,909 --> 03:03:41,670
Oh, here we go.

3298
03:03:41,670 --> 03:03:42,790
Oh, goodness.

3299
03:03:42,790 --> 03:03:44,309
I forgot to wait.

3300
03:03:44,309 --> 03:03:45,030
Here we go.

3301
03:03:45,030 --> 03:03:45,670
There we go.

3302
03:03:45,670 --> 03:03:47,270
I forgot to put a question mark at the end of that.

3303
03:03:47,829 --> 03:03:49,540
But here we go.

3304
03:03:50,180 --> 03:03:54,409
Look, I'm sorry for everything.

3305
03:03:54,409 --> 03:03:55,049
No, no, no.

3306
03:03:55,049 --> 03:03:56,329
Kraken was asking of how many we had.

3307
03:03:58,889 --> 03:03:59,690
Dude, I'm sorry.

3308
03:04:02,409 --> 03:04:03,129
Be better.

3309
03:04:03,129 --> 03:04:03,770
Then be better.

3310
03:04:03,770 --> 03:04:04,569
Then prove it to me.

3311
03:04:04,569 --> 03:04:05,370
Be better.

3312
03:04:05,370 --> 03:04:06,889
He's trying to replace me right now.

3313
03:04:06,889 --> 03:04:07,690
Be better then.

3314
03:04:07,690 --> 03:04:09,049
OK, I'm sorry.

3315
03:04:09,049 --> 03:04:10,729
I didn't bring up the poop thing he did.

3316
03:04:13,659 --> 03:04:14,219
All right.

3317
03:04:14,219 --> 03:04:15,180
You got a jump crowd.

3318
03:04:15,180 --> 03:04:15,979
OK, OK.

3319
03:04:16,700 --> 03:04:18,469
To be fair.

3320
03:04:19,110 --> 03:04:22,020
Yeah, I totally brought it up.

3321
03:04:22,020 --> 03:04:23,780
Now, Sterk can't get kicked from the guild.

3322
03:04:23,780 --> 03:04:26,500
He's the leader of the guild as much as we want him out of here.

3323
03:04:26,500 --> 03:04:28,020
He's the one that put the kick power.

3324
03:04:30,299 --> 03:04:34,459
You can't escape.

3325
03:04:34,459 --> 03:04:35,899
Oh, oh, oh, this is the big room.

3326
03:04:35,899 --> 03:04:36,299
Let's go.

3327
03:04:36,940 --> 03:04:38,540
Oh, we're about to make some money today.

3328
03:04:40,709 --> 03:04:42,389
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.

3329
03:04:44,219 --> 03:04:45,260
That move is so good.

3330
03:04:48,139 --> 03:04:49,979
The fear is long sword.

3331
03:04:49,979 --> 03:04:51,100
Whatever that like stun, whatever it is.

3332
03:04:51,100 --> 03:04:51,899
Does that work on players?

3333
03:04:51,899 --> 03:04:52,139
Oh, yeah.

3334
03:04:52,780 --> 03:04:53,579
No, I wish.

3335
03:04:53,579 --> 03:04:54,059
Oh, my God.

3336
03:04:54,059 --> 03:04:57,899
Can you imagine the carnage that would rain down upon these servers?

3337
03:04:57,899 --> 03:04:59,579
Do you know what would happen to these people?

3338
03:04:59,579 --> 03:05:01,100
It would be a stun and then a kill.

3339
03:05:02,219 --> 03:05:03,100
They wouldn't play anymore.

3340
03:05:03,100 --> 03:05:04,379
I got three diamonds.

3341
03:05:04,379 --> 03:05:06,139
Gamers, gamers, gamers, gamers.

3342
03:05:06,139 --> 03:05:06,940
No gamers.

3343
03:05:06,940 --> 03:05:07,579
Oh, Jesus.

3344
03:05:08,219 --> 03:05:13,909
Let's talk this through, boys.

3345
03:05:13,909 --> 03:05:14,629
Let's talk this through.

3346
03:05:14,629 --> 03:05:15,430
Let's talk this through.

3347
03:05:15,430 --> 03:05:15,909
Come on.

3348
03:05:15,909 --> 03:05:16,549
Come on.

3349
03:05:16,549 --> 03:05:17,430
I don't know if they're talking.

3350
03:05:18,809 --> 03:05:20,250
Have you seen the leaderboards?

3351
03:05:20,250 --> 03:05:21,290
I'm not up there, but I will be.

3352
03:05:21,290 --> 03:05:21,850
I'm not up there, but I will be.

3353
03:05:24,260 --> 03:05:25,299
Shut up, Frank.

3354
03:05:25,299 --> 03:05:26,739
Like, play the game already.

3355
03:05:26,739 --> 03:05:27,940
Shut up, Frank.

3356
03:05:27,940 --> 03:05:28,899
Oh, my God, Clyde.

3357
03:05:28,899 --> 03:05:29,780
I'm doing my best.

3358
03:05:30,420 --> 03:05:33,540
It's just don't game with your little brothers.

3359
03:05:33,540 --> 03:05:35,620
Stop talking over me when I'm trying to communicate.

3360
03:05:41,129 --> 03:05:42,090
You killed my friend.

3361
03:05:51,979 --> 03:05:52,379
Okay.

3362
03:06:04,139 --> 03:06:05,260
Where are you going, Clumb Guzzler?

3363
03:06:05,979 --> 03:06:06,459
Calm down.

3364
03:06:06,459 --> 03:06:07,020
Calm down.

3365
03:06:07,020 --> 03:06:08,540
I got to get a fucking potion on.

3366
03:06:09,180 --> 03:06:13,500
Just like that toxic fucking shitty raid leader or something.

3367
03:06:14,139 --> 03:06:15,260
That's so stupid.

3368
03:06:15,260 --> 03:06:17,020
Where's the DPS at?

3369
03:06:17,020 --> 03:06:17,659
Live by the bit.

3370
03:06:17,659 --> 03:06:19,579
The guy hasn't hit a dagger shot.

3371
03:06:19,579 --> 03:06:19,979
Hit him.

3372
03:06:19,979 --> 03:06:20,780
Hit him once.

3373
03:06:20,780 --> 03:06:21,180
Once.

3374
03:06:21,180 --> 03:06:21,659
I dare you.

3375
03:06:21,659 --> 03:06:22,379
I dare you.

3376
03:06:25,500 --> 03:06:25,979
All right.

3377
03:06:25,979 --> 03:06:26,700
Oh, shit.

3378
03:06:26,700 --> 03:06:27,260
Oh, shit.

3379
03:06:28,780 --> 03:06:29,180
Oh, my God.

3380
03:06:29,180 --> 03:06:29,659
Oh, my God.

3381
03:06:30,620 --> 03:06:32,860
Oh, did they both kill each other?

3382
03:06:32,860 --> 03:06:33,579
Oh, my God.

3383
03:06:34,379 --> 03:06:35,260
Did we?

3384
03:06:35,260 --> 03:06:35,979
I think you did.

3385
03:06:36,860 --> 03:06:37,899
No, I just killed him.

3386
03:06:37,899 --> 03:06:39,420
Look at the kill feed, boys.

3387
03:06:39,420 --> 03:06:40,219
Look at the kill feed.

3388
03:06:40,299 --> 03:06:40,860
I'll let you have it.

3389
03:06:41,899 --> 03:06:42,540
I got him.

3390
03:06:42,540 --> 03:06:42,780
Wow.

3391
03:06:42,780 --> 03:06:44,059
The kill feed said I got him.

3392
03:06:44,059 --> 03:06:44,459
Yeah, no.

3393
03:06:45,180 --> 03:06:46,500
Wait, no, it doesn't.

3394
03:06:46,500 --> 03:06:46,899
No, it doesn't.

3395
03:06:46,899 --> 03:06:47,540
No, it said I got him.

3396
03:06:47,540 --> 03:06:48,500
Yeah, no, it says I got him.

3397
03:06:48,500 --> 03:06:49,219
Yeah, I see.

3398
03:06:49,219 --> 03:06:49,620
Yeah, I see.

3399
03:06:49,620 --> 03:06:50,020
I see it.

3400
03:06:50,020 --> 03:06:50,500
You're...

3401
03:06:50,500 --> 03:06:51,299
Yep.

3402
03:06:51,299 --> 03:06:52,979
For the guild.

3403
03:06:52,979 --> 03:06:54,100
For the guild.

3404
03:06:54,100 --> 03:06:54,500
All right.

3405
03:06:54,500 --> 03:06:54,899
All right.

3406
03:06:54,899 --> 03:06:56,260
Here's where we're going.

3407
03:06:56,260 --> 03:06:57,540
Can you get my sword back?

3408
03:06:57,540 --> 03:06:58,260
Yeah, I got you.

3409
03:06:58,260 --> 03:06:58,819
I got you.

3410
03:06:58,819 --> 03:06:59,540
Thanks.

3411
03:06:59,540 --> 03:07:00,840
Oh, my God.

3412
03:07:00,840 --> 03:07:01,799
This guy was...

3413
03:07:01,799 --> 03:07:02,760
Oh, my Lord.

3414
03:07:02,760 --> 03:07:04,860
Hold on.

3415
03:07:04,860 --> 03:07:06,579
Let me just double check.

3416
03:07:06,579 --> 03:07:07,059
That's a...

3417
03:07:07,059 --> 03:07:08,420
No, that's a chicken kit.

3418
03:07:08,420 --> 03:07:08,979
Sorry.

3419
03:07:08,979 --> 03:07:09,700
Live by the bit.

3420
03:07:17,850 --> 03:07:18,969
Oh, this is so bad.

3421
03:07:18,969 --> 03:07:19,690
I thought it was...

3422
03:07:19,690 --> 03:07:21,670
Oh, this is so bad.

3423
03:07:21,670 --> 03:07:22,629
Oh, thank God.

3424
03:07:22,629 --> 03:07:23,989
Did I just throw out candies?

3425
03:07:23,989 --> 03:07:26,420
Yes, I did.

3426
03:07:26,420 --> 03:07:27,459
Ooh, long sword.

3427
03:07:30,629 --> 03:07:31,670
Oh, there it is.

3428
03:07:31,670 --> 03:07:35,590
I got a heal, though.

3429
03:07:35,590 --> 03:07:35,989
Oh, yeah.

3430
03:07:35,989 --> 03:07:37,510
This is going to be a little hairy here.

3431
03:07:37,510 --> 03:07:39,100
Are you good?

3432
03:07:39,100 --> 03:07:39,819
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3433
03:07:39,819 --> 03:07:43,770
I'm used to hairy.

3434
03:07:43,770 --> 03:07:44,329
Oh, I got...

3435
03:07:44,329 --> 03:07:45,610
I had diamonds on me, too.

3436
03:07:45,610 --> 03:07:46,409
Oh, that's too late.

3437
03:07:49,059 --> 03:07:50,180
It was too fun.

3438
03:07:53,180 --> 03:07:53,500
All right.

3439
03:07:53,500 --> 03:07:54,059
You know what?

3440
03:07:55,260 --> 03:07:57,020
Let's do a gamer one this time.

3441
03:07:57,020 --> 03:07:57,819
Let's go for like a game.

3442
03:07:57,819 --> 03:07:58,700
Play the game.

3443
03:07:58,700 --> 03:08:00,940
We're going to go for gamer mode here.

3444
03:08:00,940 --> 03:08:01,180
Okay.

3445
03:08:01,180 --> 03:08:02,459
It's like weird that you're telling us

3446
03:08:03,459 --> 03:08:04,420
that that's what you're going for,

3447
03:08:04,420 --> 03:08:05,459
but we've been doing it.

3448
03:08:05,459 --> 03:08:06,899
Yeah, but that...

3449
03:08:06,899 --> 03:08:08,579
I mean, obviously, at the end there,

3450
03:08:08,579 --> 03:08:09,700
I literally turned around

3451
03:08:09,700 --> 03:08:11,299
and got hit in the back of the head and died.

3452
03:08:11,299 --> 03:08:12,739
Hey, can I delete my character?

3453
03:08:12,739 --> 03:08:14,629
Just make a new one.

3454
03:08:14,629 --> 03:08:15,190
Sure, yeah.

3455
03:08:15,190 --> 03:08:16,629
Yeah, can I be a ranger?

3456
03:08:17,270 --> 03:08:18,469
Oh my God, please be a ranger.

3457
03:08:18,469 --> 03:08:19,110
I have a purple bow

3458
03:08:19,110 --> 03:08:21,110
that I don't want to deal with selling.

3459
03:08:21,110 --> 03:08:22,069
If you just take it.

3460
03:08:22,069 --> 03:08:22,950
The daggers...

3461
03:08:22,950 --> 03:08:25,030
I like going invisible and being a creepo,

3462
03:08:25,030 --> 03:08:27,190
but I think it would be better to do solo.

3463
03:08:27,190 --> 03:08:30,100
You know, I'm just going to be the ranger guy.

3464
03:08:30,100 --> 03:08:30,420
Yeah.

3465
03:08:30,420 --> 03:08:32,520
No, dude, be our legless.

3466
03:08:32,520 --> 03:08:32,920
Okay.

3467
03:08:32,920 --> 03:08:33,399
Oh, is it?

3468
03:08:33,399 --> 03:08:33,719
Hold on.

3469
03:08:34,620 --> 03:08:35,500
My shop is updated.

3470
03:08:36,569 --> 03:08:37,290
Beautiful.

3471
03:08:37,290 --> 03:08:42,940
Short sword, another Zwiander.

3472
03:08:42,940 --> 03:08:46,940
You can just press class change.

3473
03:08:46,940 --> 03:08:50,940
Wait, what?

3474
03:08:50,940 --> 03:08:51,750
Huh?

3475
03:08:51,750 --> 03:08:52,790
Oh, yeah, yeah, class change,

3476
03:08:52,790 --> 03:08:53,270
and then you can...

3477
03:08:53,270 --> 03:08:54,389
Yeah, you don't have to delete.

3478
03:08:54,389 --> 03:08:55,829
Yeah, you can make a brand new character.

3479
03:08:55,829 --> 03:08:56,309
Dude, this...

3480
03:08:57,430 --> 03:08:58,389
I think I'm going to get this

3481
03:08:58,389 --> 03:08:59,590
and then have this Zwiander.

3482
03:08:59,590 --> 03:09:03,159
Dude, I got to be honest,

3483
03:09:04,120 --> 03:09:07,319
the Zwiander is awful in corridors,

3484
03:09:07,319 --> 03:09:09,239
but I want you to pick

3485
03:09:09,239 --> 03:09:10,200
what's going to make you happy

3486
03:09:10,200 --> 03:09:10,840
because at the end of the day,

3487
03:09:10,840 --> 03:09:12,180
that's all that matters to me.

3488
03:09:12,180 --> 03:09:13,700
Well, so there's a...

3489
03:09:14,340 --> 03:09:17,659
There's a chest piece that's 61 armor.

3490
03:09:17,659 --> 03:09:19,239
It's cloth, though,

3491
03:09:19,239 --> 03:09:21,940
and it's two weapon damage,

3492
03:09:21,940 --> 03:09:23,459
max health, and spell casting,

3493
03:09:23,459 --> 03:09:24,979
which doesn't matter.

3494
03:09:24,979 --> 03:09:25,540
Right.

3495
03:09:25,540 --> 03:09:26,260
Or I could get...

3496
03:09:26,260 --> 03:09:27,299
No, that's 30.

3497
03:09:27,299 --> 03:09:29,270
Got bad rolls on it.

3498
03:09:31,270 --> 03:09:32,870
The long sword you had

3499
03:09:32,870 --> 03:09:34,950
had plus four physical damage

3500
03:09:34,950 --> 03:09:36,790
and 1.5 action speed.

3501
03:09:36,790 --> 03:09:38,790
This is kind of a god roll on a blue.

3502
03:09:41,850 --> 03:09:42,809
Yeah, I think...

3503
03:09:42,809 --> 03:09:43,690
You're going to keep it?

3504
03:09:43,690 --> 03:09:45,260
No, no, no, I can't even use it,

3505
03:09:45,260 --> 03:09:46,540
but I'm going to give it back to you.

3506
03:09:46,540 --> 03:09:47,579
This thing's nuts.

3507
03:09:47,579 --> 03:09:49,559
And you were rocking with it.

3508
03:09:49,559 --> 03:09:50,200
It's five...

3509
03:09:50,200 --> 03:09:56,489
Yeah, this thing would be amazing.

3510
03:09:56,569 --> 03:10:00,010
So this sword versus the purple I have.

3511
03:10:00,010 --> 03:10:01,500
This is plus two agility,

3512
03:10:01,500 --> 03:10:03,000
two resourcefulness,

3513
03:10:03,000 --> 03:10:04,040
a little bit of interaction speed,

3514
03:10:04,040 --> 03:10:04,840
and 53 damage.

3515
03:10:04,840 --> 03:10:06,200
What's the one that I have right now?

3516
03:10:06,200 --> 03:10:11,500
57, three will, max health, and item speed.

3517
03:10:11,500 --> 03:10:17,239
It's probably always just damage, isn't it?

3518
03:10:17,239 --> 03:10:21,700
For the variation on the Zweihander?

3519
03:10:21,700 --> 03:10:22,260
Yeah, like which...

3520
03:10:23,989 --> 03:10:25,030
So I have one as well right now.

3521
03:10:25,030 --> 03:10:26,549
Mine's weapon damage, 55,

3522
03:10:26,549 --> 03:10:27,270
plus two knowledge,

3523
03:10:27,270 --> 03:10:28,149
plus two weapon damage,

3524
03:10:28,149 --> 03:10:30,569
plus three move speed.

3525
03:10:30,569 --> 03:10:33,659
Spear is nice, too, people are saying.

3526
03:10:33,659 --> 03:10:35,899
Spear is a fantastic weapon.

3527
03:10:35,899 --> 03:10:37,260
I think you would really like Spear.

3528
03:10:37,260 --> 03:10:38,540
I don't have 30, though.

3529
03:10:38,540 --> 03:10:39,819
I only have 25.

3530
03:10:39,819 --> 03:10:40,540
Here, trade me.

3531
03:10:40,540 --> 03:10:42,739
I'll just give you the candy that I have.

3532
03:10:42,739 --> 03:10:43,459
Oh, shit.

3533
03:10:43,459 --> 03:10:44,020
Okay.

3534
03:10:44,020 --> 03:10:45,260
Yeah, so go to...

3535
03:10:45,260 --> 03:10:46,540
Do you know how the trade channel works?

3536
03:10:46,540 --> 03:10:47,100
I don't.

3537
03:10:47,100 --> 03:10:47,819
Become a trader.

3538
03:10:47,819 --> 03:10:48,790
So go to...

3539
03:10:48,790 --> 03:10:49,590
Yeah, so go...

3540
03:10:49,590 --> 03:10:50,629
Yeah, you have to spend some gold.

3541
03:10:50,629 --> 03:10:51,819
Hopefully you have it.

3542
03:10:51,819 --> 03:10:52,700
Yeah, I got plenty.

3543
03:10:52,700 --> 03:10:53,739
So just become a trader.

3544
03:10:53,739 --> 03:10:54,219
Right.

3545
03:10:54,219 --> 03:10:54,540
Yep.

3546
03:10:54,540 --> 03:10:55,819
And go to Miss Trade 1.

3547
03:10:55,819 --> 03:10:56,620
I'm going to type in...

3548
03:10:58,059 --> 03:11:00,739
Okay.

3549
03:11:00,739 --> 03:11:02,899
100 subs to kill...

3550
03:11:02,899 --> 03:11:03,940
No, no, don't write that.

3551
03:11:04,680 --> 03:11:06,600
And then you're going to right click that and trade me.

3552
03:11:06,600 --> 03:11:07,319
It should say,

3553
03:11:08,120 --> 03:11:08,360
Oh.

3554
03:11:08,360 --> 03:11:08,920
All right, it's French.

3555
03:11:09,799 --> 03:11:10,629
Fucker.

3556
03:11:11,989 --> 03:11:16,340
Oh, yeah, you're the one with the French name, right?

3557
03:11:16,340 --> 03:11:16,659
Okay.

3558
03:11:16,659 --> 03:11:17,059
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3559
03:11:17,860 --> 03:11:18,260
Thank you.

3560
03:11:20,389 --> 03:11:22,149
Oh, hey, I'm good.

3561
03:11:22,149 --> 03:11:23,989
Can you all invite Sir Dipey?

3562
03:11:23,989 --> 03:11:28,569
Then click the check mark.

3563
03:11:28,569 --> 03:11:29,690
It's like a RuneScape trade.

3564
03:11:29,690 --> 03:11:30,809
Double confirmed.

3565
03:11:30,809 --> 03:11:35,930
Wait, no, that's cancel.

3566
03:11:37,399 --> 03:11:38,120
Did you cancel it?

3567
03:11:38,120 --> 03:11:38,600
No.

3568
03:11:38,600 --> 03:11:39,700
Oh, beautiful.

3569
03:11:39,700 --> 03:11:40,659
Oh, yeah.

3570
03:11:40,659 --> 03:11:41,540
Long one.

3571
03:11:41,540 --> 03:11:42,969
Very cool.

3572
03:11:42,969 --> 03:11:43,530
All right, cool.

3573
03:11:44,090 --> 03:11:44,409
Thank you.

3574
03:11:44,409 --> 03:11:45,290
I appreciate that.

3575
03:11:45,290 --> 03:11:45,930
Of course.

3576
03:11:45,930 --> 03:11:50,250
So now I go to Merchant.

3577
03:11:50,250 --> 03:11:53,180
So the Spear.

3578
03:11:53,180 --> 03:11:56,250
This thing is really, really good.

3579
03:11:56,250 --> 03:11:58,569
Yeah, and I gave you the additional candy

3580
03:11:58,569 --> 03:12:00,010
because I want you to try the Spear.

3581
03:12:00,010 --> 03:12:00,889
It's not for everybody.

3582
03:12:00,889 --> 03:12:01,850
I will tell you that right now.

3583
03:12:02,409 --> 03:12:06,010
But you'd have to be a troglodyte not to use it effectively.

3584
03:12:06,010 --> 03:12:06,809
Whoa.

3585
03:12:06,809 --> 03:12:07,370
Okay, let me...

3586
03:12:07,930 --> 03:12:08,729
Whoa, dude.

3587
03:12:08,729 --> 03:12:09,450
Yeah, I got it.

3588
03:12:09,450 --> 03:12:10,569
I know, I know, I know.

3589
03:12:10,569 --> 03:12:12,540
Is that good?

3590
03:12:12,540 --> 03:12:15,879
Did I got it?

3591
03:12:15,879 --> 03:12:17,799
Yeah, I mean, I would run the Spear.

3592
03:12:17,799 --> 03:12:18,360
I would run it.

3593
03:12:18,360 --> 03:12:21,540
All right, let me put it on.

3594
03:12:21,540 --> 03:12:23,700
If you hate it, then it wasn't my idea.

3595
03:12:23,700 --> 03:12:25,219
All right, okay, this is...

3596
03:12:25,940 --> 03:12:26,819
I'm playing this one.

3597
03:12:26,819 --> 03:12:28,579
No, I'm not going to go over voice chat and be like,

3598
03:12:28,579 --> 03:12:30,579
it's me, now I say...

3599
03:12:30,579 --> 03:12:32,260
No, I'm not losing this.

3600
03:12:32,260 --> 03:12:34,780
I don't know, where is your voice chat key?

3601
03:12:34,780 --> 03:12:36,940
Because you didn't even move to avoid the attack.

3602
03:12:37,739 --> 03:12:39,659
Is it the plus and minus?

3603
03:12:39,659 --> 03:12:42,940
But what did you have to press to do that?

3604
03:12:44,379 --> 03:12:46,299
I wanted them to kill me.

3605
03:12:46,940 --> 03:12:48,700
I wanted this to be yelling at you

3606
03:12:49,340 --> 03:12:51,500
and they take the opportunity to kill me.

3607
03:12:51,500 --> 03:12:54,700
And then they have a story for the rest of their life.

3608
03:12:54,700 --> 03:12:56,979
That is so sweet of you.

3609
03:12:56,979 --> 03:13:00,389
I guess I'm just not content-minded.

3610
03:13:00,979 --> 03:13:03,049
I'm too smooth-brained for that.

3611
03:13:03,049 --> 03:13:04,569
What's your new player name?

3612
03:13:04,569 --> 03:13:07,610
You put it in Discord, Sir Dipey.

3613
03:13:07,610 --> 03:13:08,790
Nice.

3614
03:13:08,790 --> 03:13:09,270
Why?

3615
03:13:09,270 --> 03:13:11,110
But oh, that's your actual name.

3616
03:13:11,110 --> 03:13:14,500
What are you on that tonight for?

3617
03:13:14,500 --> 03:13:15,860
I'm on that always.

3618
03:13:15,860 --> 03:13:17,620
Dipey has been one of my new favorite words.

3619
03:13:19,989 --> 03:13:21,430
Foraging for food, pretty good.

3620
03:13:25,690 --> 03:13:26,649
Is that a perk?

3621
03:13:28,600 --> 03:13:29,639
I run the Sharpshooter.

3622
03:13:29,639 --> 03:13:31,799
I run the headshot one for my first one.

3623
03:13:31,799 --> 03:13:32,520
You get like three heals.

3624
03:13:32,520 --> 03:13:34,440
No, not the perks, the skills.

3625
03:13:34,440 --> 03:13:34,840
It's a heal.

3626
03:13:34,840 --> 03:13:35,399
You got skills.

3627
03:13:35,879 --> 03:13:37,959
Yeah, heal 25 when you forage for food.

3628
03:13:37,959 --> 03:13:40,280
Goated, goated, goated.

3629
03:13:40,280 --> 03:13:43,290
Do not take that off.

3630
03:13:43,290 --> 03:13:47,430
So let me go into...

3631
03:13:48,250 --> 03:13:50,809
I also am bringing you an Arming Sword and a Shortsword.

3632
03:13:50,809 --> 03:13:53,459
I'm bringing you a Shortsword.

3633
03:13:53,459 --> 03:13:55,780
So I guess you can't even buy anything.

3634
03:13:55,780 --> 03:13:57,139
You're a brand new character.

3635
03:13:57,139 --> 03:13:58,979
I'm brand new.

3636
03:13:58,979 --> 03:14:00,020
Should I just buy...

3637
03:14:00,020 --> 03:14:01,379
If I'm going to have the spear on,

3638
03:14:01,379 --> 03:14:02,899
should I buy anything like armor?

3639
03:14:02,899 --> 03:14:03,940
Are we just going to go for it?

3640
03:14:06,229 --> 03:14:08,309
You said this was a real gamer one.

3641
03:14:08,309 --> 03:14:10,790
Yeah, so in theory, if you're going to run...

3642
03:14:11,750 --> 03:14:14,389
Because like barbs can get away with being lazy

3643
03:14:14,389 --> 03:14:15,510
and just having a weapon.

3644
03:14:15,510 --> 03:14:16,229
You cannot.

3645
03:14:16,229 --> 03:14:16,950
You need a kit.

3646
03:14:18,229 --> 03:14:20,790
But then again, armor slows you down.

3647
03:14:20,790 --> 03:14:22,629
So if you want to run faster,

3648
03:14:22,629 --> 03:14:25,030
you might want like a leather kind of thing

3649
03:14:25,030 --> 03:14:26,969
or like a padded situation.

3650
03:14:26,969 --> 03:14:27,770
I like to take...

3651
03:14:27,770 --> 03:14:29,209
Yeah, I want to be able to take some hits.

3652
03:14:29,209 --> 03:14:29,850
I'll get a few things.

3653
03:14:29,850 --> 03:14:32,409
So what I would say is I would check like and just...

3654
03:14:32,409 --> 03:14:34,090
If you have any greens in the shop,

3655
03:14:34,090 --> 03:14:35,770
definitely go for that first.

3656
03:14:36,809 --> 03:14:38,329
But just make sure the attributes make sense.

3657
03:14:38,329 --> 03:14:40,649
And if not, then don't worry about it, honestly.

3658
03:14:40,649 --> 03:14:41,930
And I can check my shop, too.

3659
03:14:41,930 --> 03:14:44,409
Just magic resistance, interaction speed, armor,

3660
03:14:44,409 --> 03:14:45,540
headshot protection.

3661
03:14:45,540 --> 03:14:46,979
Oh, Vinny, thanks for the raid.

3662
03:14:46,979 --> 03:14:48,180
I just saw Vinesauce.

3663
03:14:48,180 --> 03:14:50,420
Thanks, Vinny.

3664
03:14:50,420 --> 03:14:51,379
Thanks for playing earlier, too.

3665
03:14:51,379 --> 03:14:53,079
Yo, Vinster.

3666
03:14:53,079 --> 03:14:54,120
Thank you, Vinny.

3667
03:14:54,120 --> 03:14:55,690
Welcome, everybody.

3668
03:14:55,690 --> 03:14:57,940
We're just kind of playing the game.

3669
03:15:00,899 --> 03:15:03,940
Okay, well, I'll find other stuff, too.

3670
03:15:03,940 --> 03:15:05,979
I was 10 minutes late.

3671
03:15:05,979 --> 03:15:07,260
All right, I actually...

3672
03:15:07,260 --> 03:15:08,700
Let's actually try to win this one.

3673
03:15:08,700 --> 03:15:10,780
Like, because I got to...

3674
03:15:10,780 --> 03:15:12,059
I don't want to lose this thing.

3675
03:15:12,059 --> 03:15:13,500
Where's SirDykeB's shirt?

3676
03:15:13,500 --> 03:15:14,299
That's what I'm wondering.

3677
03:15:14,299 --> 03:15:17,190
Should I put a shirt on?

3678
03:15:17,270 --> 03:15:18,069
I mean, it's...

3679
03:15:18,069 --> 03:15:20,889
I just wondered where it went.

3680
03:15:20,889 --> 03:15:23,299
I mean, when you got a body like this.

3681
03:15:23,299 --> 03:15:23,780
Facts.

3682
03:15:23,780 --> 03:15:24,420
I'm ready.

3683
03:15:24,420 --> 03:15:24,979
All right.

3684
03:15:24,979 --> 03:15:25,700
That's my body.

3685
03:15:25,700 --> 03:15:26,579
My body is ready now.

3686
03:15:26,579 --> 03:15:26,739
All right.

3687
03:15:26,739 --> 03:15:27,459
Let's call it out of here.

3688
03:15:27,459 --> 03:15:27,780
Let's go.

3689
03:15:27,780 --> 03:15:28,420
Let's go.

3690
03:15:28,420 --> 03:15:39,770
Ready up, SirDykeB.

3691
03:15:39,770 --> 03:15:41,209
Aren't you, like, not ready?

3692
03:15:41,209 --> 03:15:42,860
I was waiting for you to be ready.

3693
03:15:42,860 --> 03:15:45,899
Oh, I got...

3694
03:15:45,899 --> 03:15:46,459
Oh, my God.

3695
03:15:46,459 --> 03:15:50,139
I got the best thing for you.

3696
03:15:50,139 --> 03:15:51,659
Don't mess this up for me.

3697
03:15:51,659 --> 03:15:52,059
I'm living...

3698
03:15:52,059 --> 03:15:53,659
The Ranger portrait doesn't look like

3699
03:15:53,659 --> 03:15:54,620
he's drawing an arrow.

3700
03:15:54,620 --> 03:15:58,149
It looks like he's sniffing something.

3701
03:15:58,149 --> 03:15:59,379
There you go.

3702
03:15:59,379 --> 03:16:00,100
Facts.

3703
03:16:00,100 --> 03:16:00,739
True.

3704
03:16:00,739 --> 03:16:02,090
This man's spitting.

3705
03:16:02,090 --> 03:16:16,170
Here, Magona for a smoke.

3706
03:16:16,170 --> 03:16:16,409
All right.

3707
03:16:16,409 --> 03:16:16,809
Let's...

3708
03:16:17,850 --> 03:16:18,969
Clear comms.

3709
03:16:18,969 --> 03:16:19,750
Let's play.

3710
03:16:20,629 --> 03:16:20,950
Yep.

3711
03:16:20,950 --> 03:16:21,590
Here you go.

3712
03:16:21,590 --> 03:16:23,989
Take this.

3713
03:16:23,989 --> 03:16:25,670
This is for you.

3714
03:16:25,670 --> 03:16:27,829
Oh, my goodness gracious.

3715
03:16:27,829 --> 03:16:28,309
Yep.

3716
03:16:28,309 --> 03:16:28,870
Take that.

3717
03:16:28,870 --> 03:16:29,829
Why did I just hear myself?

3718
03:16:29,829 --> 03:16:31,340
That was weird.

3719
03:16:31,340 --> 03:16:32,620
I think you did voice chat.

3720
03:16:32,620 --> 03:16:32,940
Thank you.

3721
03:16:34,520 --> 03:16:37,239
Oh, I did voice chat,

3722
03:16:37,239 --> 03:16:38,280
and it's probably using...

3723
03:16:39,770 --> 03:16:40,489
What?

3724
03:16:40,489 --> 03:16:44,969
My whole ass different...

3725
03:16:44,969 --> 03:16:45,450
Hold on.

3726
03:16:48,379 --> 03:16:50,139
Your desktop audio is coming through.

3727
03:16:50,979 --> 03:16:53,159
That is so funny.

3728
03:16:53,159 --> 03:16:54,760
You listed it as your input device.

3729
03:16:54,760 --> 03:16:55,479
That's brilliant.

3730
03:16:55,479 --> 03:16:56,969
That's such a...

3731
03:16:56,969 --> 03:16:57,610
His whole ass.

3732
03:16:57,610 --> 03:17:02,260
Do that if you can stealth at all times.

3733
03:17:02,260 --> 03:17:04,329
Well, I don't think there's a way to change

3734
03:17:04,329 --> 03:17:05,370
your audio channel.

3735
03:17:05,370 --> 03:17:06,010
Wait, there is.

3736
03:17:06,010 --> 03:17:06,729
You'd have to go to...

3737
03:17:06,729 --> 03:17:09,479
Maybe default in Windows first.

3738
03:17:09,479 --> 03:17:09,959
I can't.

3739
03:17:11,909 --> 03:17:12,409
Yikes.

3740
03:17:16,540 --> 03:17:18,379
I guess we're gonna have to be super gamers.

3741
03:17:18,379 --> 03:17:20,040
This thing's fun.

3742
03:17:20,040 --> 03:17:20,840
Let me make sure.

3743
03:17:22,440 --> 03:17:23,239
You feel the power now?

3744
03:17:23,239 --> 03:17:24,520
You feel the power of the perp?

3745
03:17:24,520 --> 03:17:25,020
Yeah.

3746
03:17:25,829 --> 03:17:27,909
This room is kind of awful, but...

3747
03:17:27,909 --> 03:17:29,430
It's literally the worst.

3748
03:17:29,430 --> 03:17:30,870
There's a bunch of skeeters here.

3749
03:17:30,870 --> 03:17:32,309
I don't like mosquitoes on by you, but...

3750
03:17:32,309 --> 03:17:33,750
Oh, he's just turning around.

3751
03:17:33,750 --> 03:17:34,250
Yeah.

3752
03:17:34,870 --> 03:17:36,540
Really think of the rain.

3753
03:17:36,540 --> 03:17:37,100
Appreciate that.

3754
03:17:37,100 --> 03:17:38,860
Yeah, what's the range?

3755
03:17:38,860 --> 03:17:39,340
Oh, my God.

3756
03:17:40,219 --> 03:17:41,739
She's got some range on her.

3757
03:17:41,739 --> 03:17:42,139
Hold on.

3758
03:17:42,139 --> 03:17:43,510
Watch out.

3759
03:17:43,510 --> 03:17:44,229
Watching.

3760
03:17:44,229 --> 03:17:44,950
How far is it?

3761
03:17:44,950 --> 03:17:47,209
Close, close, close.

3762
03:17:47,930 --> 03:17:48,729
Oh, that's...

3763
03:17:49,370 --> 03:17:50,969
That is actually pretty far.

3764
03:17:50,969 --> 03:17:51,290
Damn.

3765
03:17:51,290 --> 03:17:54,219
Oh, yeah.

3766
03:17:54,219 --> 03:17:54,780
We can.

3767
03:17:54,780 --> 03:17:55,260
Yes.

3768
03:17:55,260 --> 03:17:56,340
Yes.

3769
03:17:56,340 --> 03:17:56,579
Okay.

3770
03:17:56,579 --> 03:17:59,129
We can also hear ourself again, too.

3771
03:17:59,129 --> 03:17:59,530
Could you?

3772
03:17:59,530 --> 03:18:00,090
Wait, really?

3773
03:18:00,090 --> 03:18:00,409
Yeah.

3774
03:18:00,409 --> 03:18:02,469
I heard you coming through him.

3775
03:18:02,469 --> 03:18:03,510
No, he talked.

3776
03:18:03,510 --> 03:18:04,149
I talked as well.

3777
03:18:04,149 --> 03:18:04,709
Oh, you talked.

3778
03:18:04,709 --> 03:18:05,209
Okay.

3779
03:18:09,909 --> 03:18:11,639
All right.

3780
03:18:11,639 --> 03:18:13,079
Oh, that is a trap.

3781
03:18:13,079 --> 03:18:13,319
Yeah.

3782
03:18:13,319 --> 03:18:13,959
That's a trap room.

3783
03:18:13,959 --> 03:18:15,559
And you have to pick pocket to get that.

3784
03:18:15,559 --> 03:18:16,280
So don't even bother.

3785
03:18:16,280 --> 03:18:17,000
But kill these guys.

3786
03:18:17,000 --> 03:18:18,440
These guys usually have pendants.

3787
03:18:18,440 --> 03:18:19,159
Oh, my God.

3788
03:18:19,159 --> 03:18:20,280
It came from...

3789
03:18:20,280 --> 03:18:25,190
What the...

3790
03:18:25,190 --> 03:18:26,540
Oh, you just hit me.

3791
03:18:26,540 --> 03:18:27,340
Do I have to re...

3792
03:18:28,360 --> 03:18:29,159
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

3793
03:18:29,159 --> 03:18:30,680
Don't die, don't die.

3794
03:18:30,680 --> 03:18:31,159
Dude.

3795
03:18:31,159 --> 03:18:32,840
This is a real gamer one, dude.

3796
03:18:32,840 --> 03:18:33,399
I don't...

3797
03:18:33,399 --> 03:18:34,920
I think you hit me with your axe.

3798
03:18:34,920 --> 03:18:35,399
I think I did.

3799
03:18:35,399 --> 03:18:36,360
I didn't.

3800
03:18:36,360 --> 03:18:36,680
I think it...

3801
03:18:36,680 --> 03:18:37,479
No, it was me.

3802
03:18:37,479 --> 03:18:37,959
It's my fault.

3803
03:18:37,959 --> 03:18:41,799
I fired one arrow and it is inside this skull.

3804
03:18:41,799 --> 03:18:43,319
But good news is you have second wind

3805
03:18:43,319 --> 03:18:44,920
and we also get a campfire from the ranger.

3806
03:18:44,920 --> 03:18:45,559
So everything's fine.

3807
03:18:45,559 --> 03:18:46,200
I didn't do anything wrong.

3808
03:18:46,200 --> 03:18:46,760
No, no.

3809
03:18:46,760 --> 03:18:47,879
We're good, we're good.

3810
03:18:47,879 --> 03:18:48,520
No, we're good.

3811
03:18:48,520 --> 03:18:49,319
We're good.

3812
03:18:49,319 --> 03:18:50,200
Do any of you guys have...

3813
03:18:50,200 --> 03:18:50,360
Oh, wait.

3814
03:18:50,360 --> 03:18:51,719
There's a health thing over here.

3815
03:18:51,719 --> 03:18:51,879
Sorry.

3816
03:18:51,879 --> 03:18:52,440
Oh, shit.

3817
03:18:53,079 --> 03:18:56,520
Where you're crouching and it wants you to press F to interact.

3818
03:18:56,520 --> 03:18:57,559
We can't do both.

3819
03:18:57,559 --> 03:18:57,879
Hold on.

3820
03:18:57,879 --> 03:18:59,239
German, no!

3821
03:18:59,239 --> 03:18:59,879
German, no!

3822
03:18:59,879 --> 03:19:00,600
What's wrong?

3823
03:19:00,600 --> 03:19:01,159
What's going on?

3824
03:19:03,510 --> 03:19:04,229
Skelly.

3825
03:19:04,229 --> 03:19:05,030
Where did he come from?

3826
03:19:05,030 --> 03:19:05,430
Where does...

3827
03:19:05,430 --> 03:19:05,750
All right.

3828
03:19:05,750 --> 03:19:06,389
Can we kill this?

3829
03:19:07,030 --> 03:19:07,590
Yeah, we can kill it.

3830
03:19:07,590 --> 03:19:08,069
We can kill it.

3831
03:19:08,069 --> 03:19:08,790
But don't die.

3832
03:19:09,510 --> 03:19:10,389
We can kill if you don't die.

3833
03:19:10,950 --> 03:19:11,750
Does that make sense?

3834
03:19:12,389 --> 03:19:13,510
I think that makes sense.

3835
03:19:16,020 --> 03:19:16,979
I've run the numbers.

3836
03:19:16,979 --> 03:19:18,180
If you don't die, we can kill it.

3837
03:19:21,739 --> 03:19:22,459
Oh, my God.

3838
03:19:27,260 --> 03:19:28,620
I have my fear again in a second.

3839
03:19:30,329 --> 03:19:31,850
That's a lot of enemies, friends.

3840
03:19:35,049 --> 03:19:37,370
I don't really know how my character works yet.

3841
03:19:37,370 --> 03:19:37,930
Okay, hold on.

3842
03:19:37,930 --> 03:19:38,649
I'm fearing them away.

3843
03:19:39,370 --> 03:19:40,739
Take this time to run.

3844
03:19:40,739 --> 03:19:41,459
Take this time to run.

3845
03:19:42,729 --> 03:19:43,209
I'm dead.

3846
03:19:43,209 --> 03:19:43,690
Oh, my God.

3847
03:19:43,690 --> 03:19:44,090
Oh, my God.

3848
03:19:44,090 --> 03:19:44,569
I died.

3849
03:19:44,569 --> 03:19:45,370
Oh, I actually died.

3850
03:19:45,370 --> 03:19:46,489
I don't know what I was doing.

3851
03:19:46,489 --> 03:19:47,370
I don't know why I did that.

3852
03:19:47,370 --> 03:19:47,930
I thought...

3853
03:19:47,930 --> 03:19:48,489
I thought...

3854
03:19:48,489 --> 03:19:49,370
Because you said you feared him.

3855
03:19:49,370 --> 03:19:50,170
I was like, okay, they feared.

3856
03:19:50,170 --> 03:19:51,129
I can take this and run.

3857
03:19:51,930 --> 03:19:52,569
Oh, my God.

3858
03:19:52,569 --> 03:19:53,209
Oh, my God.

3859
03:19:53,370 --> 03:19:54,250
This is the worst day ever.

3860
03:19:54,250 --> 03:19:54,969
No, that's bad.

3861
03:19:54,969 --> 03:19:55,610
That's really bad.

3862
03:19:55,610 --> 03:19:56,409
I thought I had time.

3863
03:19:56,409 --> 03:19:57,049
That's the champion man.

3864
03:19:57,049 --> 03:19:57,770
That's the problem.

3865
03:19:59,209 --> 03:19:59,690
Oh, no.

3866
03:19:59,690 --> 03:20:02,250
Start shooting the champion with the arrows.

3867
03:20:02,250 --> 03:20:02,889
The bow.

3868
03:20:02,889 --> 03:20:03,530
I am.

3869
03:20:03,530 --> 03:20:05,610
I don't want to hit you because Jerma is going to say that I hit him.

3870
03:20:05,610 --> 03:20:06,090
No, I understand.

3871
03:20:06,090 --> 03:20:07,370
No, no, no, no, no.

3872
03:20:07,370 --> 03:20:07,690
It's okay.

3873
03:20:07,690 --> 03:20:08,090
It's okay.

3874
03:20:08,090 --> 03:20:08,729
Everyone relax.

3875
03:20:08,729 --> 03:20:09,209
Good comms.

3876
03:20:09,209 --> 03:20:09,690
Team comms.

3877
03:20:09,690 --> 03:20:10,250
Team comms.

3878
03:20:10,250 --> 03:20:11,129
I just thought...

3879
03:20:11,129 --> 03:20:12,889
I thought that everybody was feared over there

3880
03:20:12,889 --> 03:20:14,329
and I was like, I have two or three seconds.

3881
03:20:14,329 --> 03:20:15,450
I get it.

3882
03:20:15,450 --> 03:20:16,170
He's on me.

3883
03:20:16,170 --> 03:20:18,010
I'm going to walk up here and I'm going to lay a trap.

3884
03:20:18,889 --> 03:20:20,729
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to swing on his ass.

3885
03:20:21,290 --> 03:20:22,920
Come here, baby.

3886
03:20:22,920 --> 03:20:25,159
Are we going to get Jerma's ass here?

3887
03:20:25,159 --> 03:20:25,799
Oh, Jesus.

3888
03:20:31,719 --> 03:20:32,920
This is a bad run.

3889
03:20:32,920 --> 03:20:34,680
This is not a good run.

3890
03:20:34,680 --> 03:20:35,879
This is a very bad one.

3891
03:20:38,579 --> 03:20:46,889
Okay, you know how...

3892
03:20:46,889 --> 03:20:47,770
All right.

3893
03:20:47,770 --> 03:20:48,170
Do you know how...

3894
03:20:48,170 --> 03:20:49,450
That's a real gamer one.

3895
03:20:49,450 --> 03:20:52,180
Do you know how shit just like falls apart

3896
03:20:52,180 --> 03:20:54,739
and you kind of just don't even know how or why?

3897
03:20:56,649 --> 03:20:58,889
I don't even know what happened.

3898
03:20:58,889 --> 03:21:01,209
It just fell apart so quickly.

3899
03:21:01,209 --> 03:21:05,370
It was just abrupt chaos that we just couldn't fucking solve.

3900
03:21:07,260 --> 03:21:09,739
Once it started going, it just wouldn't stop, man.

3901
03:21:11,579 --> 03:21:13,260
It's just like, oh, there's a heal over there.

3902
03:21:13,260 --> 03:21:13,819
Oh, it's okay.

3903
03:21:13,819 --> 03:21:17,579
We have like five aggroed and there's 10.

3904
03:21:17,579 --> 03:21:20,059
I think I can get this heal off and then it's just over.

3905
03:21:20,059 --> 03:21:24,569
The whole thing just falls apart and I got...

3906
03:21:24,569 --> 03:21:24,969
It's okay.

3907
03:21:24,969 --> 03:21:27,340
I still got this way under.

3908
03:21:27,340 --> 03:21:28,920
You caused that?

3909
03:21:29,000 --> 03:21:34,040
No, what caused it was the big champion skeleton existed

3910
03:21:34,040 --> 03:21:36,600
and we didn't all just run away at the same time.

3911
03:21:38,700 --> 03:21:41,049
The guild is fucking falling apart.

3912
03:21:41,049 --> 03:21:42,090
I hate this guild.

3913
03:21:42,090 --> 03:21:43,930
I'm going to go get water because you guys are going to like

3914
03:21:44,649 --> 03:21:46,489
re-ready your characters for another 20 minutes.

3915
03:21:47,209 --> 03:21:50,250
Can you tell me who the fuck you're working for, Jerma?

3916
03:21:50,250 --> 03:21:52,729
Who hired you to ruin my barb legacy?

3917
03:21:52,729 --> 03:21:54,969
Oh, you don't have any subs I got for that one.

3918
03:21:54,969 --> 03:21:58,250
You don't have any idea?

3919
03:21:58,250 --> 03:21:58,750
Zero.

3920
03:22:00,920 --> 03:22:02,040
I still have five purple holes.

3921
03:22:02,040 --> 03:22:03,180
Let's go.

3922
03:22:03,180 --> 03:22:05,579
Okay, actually I do need to pee.

3923
03:22:05,579 --> 03:22:06,379
I don't want to get some water.

3924
03:22:06,379 --> 03:22:07,659
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3925
03:22:09,100 --> 03:22:10,459
At least it was funny.

3926
03:22:11,340 --> 03:22:13,500
No, no, it's fucking hilarious.

3927
03:22:13,500 --> 03:22:15,500
It was all my fault.

3928
03:22:15,500 --> 03:22:17,260
Do I take the L on this one?

3929
03:22:17,260 --> 03:22:20,459
I would say I didn't come that there was a skelly champion

3930
03:22:20,459 --> 03:22:22,139
coming soon enough for you.

3931
03:22:22,139 --> 03:22:23,739
I didn't recognize that he was aggroed on you.

3932
03:22:23,739 --> 03:22:26,780
I thought he was on me and I will take the blame initially.

3933
03:22:27,420 --> 03:22:32,969
After that, everything was you.

3934
03:22:32,969 --> 03:22:33,610
Respect.

3935
03:22:33,610 --> 03:22:36,809
Oh, it was fun though.

3936
03:22:36,809 --> 03:22:38,090
That's all that matters.

3937
03:22:38,090 --> 03:22:38,809
No, I had a great time.

3938
03:22:38,809 --> 03:22:40,010
It was fucking hilarious.

3939
03:22:40,010 --> 03:22:43,260
Yeah, I demoted you in the guild hall.

3940
03:22:43,260 --> 03:22:43,659
That's fine.

3941
03:22:43,659 --> 03:22:45,899
You don't have access to guild stash anymore, man.

3942
03:22:45,899 --> 03:22:46,379
That's fine.

3943
03:22:46,379 --> 03:22:48,459
I already cleaned the bank out before you did that.

3944
03:22:51,559 --> 03:22:52,360
Look at all this.

3945
03:22:53,239 --> 03:22:54,659
I mean, you're still in the guild.

3946
03:22:55,620 --> 03:22:56,659
Take a look at all this.

3947
03:22:56,659 --> 03:22:57,379
A WoW guild?

3948
03:22:58,100 --> 03:23:00,700
Okay, yeah, I'll bear it back.

3949
03:23:00,700 --> 03:23:01,500
I gotta pee.

3950
03:23:01,500 --> 03:23:06,969
Beer pee.

3951
03:27:55,319 --> 03:28:16,700
Hello?

3952
03:28:16,700 --> 03:28:17,719
Anybody there?

3953
03:28:17,719 --> 03:28:20,629
How are we?

3954
03:28:20,629 --> 03:28:22,250
Hello, hello, hello.

3955
03:28:22,250 --> 03:28:24,040
All right.

3956
03:28:24,040 --> 03:28:26,040
Well, that was good.

3957
03:28:26,040 --> 03:28:29,670
That was a decent warm up round.

3958
03:28:29,670 --> 03:28:31,479
Yeah, I think we're the guild now.

3959
03:28:31,639 --> 03:28:32,600
How are you guys doing on time?

3960
03:28:34,549 --> 03:28:36,309
I will be playing this until 5 a.m.

3961
03:28:36,309 --> 03:28:37,190
I kid you not.

3962
03:28:38,389 --> 03:28:44,229
What about Mr. Stirr?

3963
03:28:44,229 --> 03:28:45,110
I think he's...

3964
03:28:45,110 --> 03:28:45,590
Let's go.

3965
03:28:46,309 --> 03:28:47,909
Honest to goodness, let's play.

3966
03:28:47,909 --> 03:28:48,389
Okay.

3967
03:28:48,389 --> 03:28:51,799
Stirr, how are you on time?

3968
03:28:51,799 --> 03:28:53,799
Are you good for a little bit longer?

3969
03:28:53,799 --> 03:28:57,479
I'd say I got like a week left before the worms take me.

3970
03:28:57,479 --> 03:29:00,469
Well, I mean tonight.

3971
03:29:00,469 --> 03:29:04,659
Oh, I don't know.

3972
03:29:04,659 --> 03:29:05,159
Okay.

3973
03:29:06,329 --> 03:29:07,780
I'm in it till I'm not.

3974
03:29:07,780 --> 03:29:08,020
Okay.

3975
03:29:08,020 --> 03:29:08,739
Honest to goodness.

3976
03:29:09,540 --> 03:29:11,780
Now, I might make a suggestion.

3977
03:29:11,780 --> 03:29:14,260
I can keep on going, Barb, if you'd like.

3978
03:29:14,260 --> 03:29:16,540
I can also play cleric.

3979
03:29:16,540 --> 03:29:18,459
If you guys wanted to get some more action,

3980
03:29:18,459 --> 03:29:23,299
a little bit more blood on your swords and whatnot.

3981
03:29:23,299 --> 03:29:26,899
I would like to be a ranger behind your big axe though.

3982
03:29:26,899 --> 03:29:27,459
No, I understand.

3983
03:29:27,459 --> 03:29:29,959
I'll keep axing.

3984
03:29:29,959 --> 03:29:31,799
Because otherwise our frontliner is the guy

3985
03:29:31,799 --> 03:29:34,120
who like comedically turns around to talk to us.

3986
03:29:34,680 --> 03:29:36,360
And I can't trust that.

3987
03:29:36,360 --> 03:29:37,559
Yeah, but that's...

3988
03:29:37,559 --> 03:29:39,799
It's funny though.

3989
03:29:39,799 --> 03:29:41,239
One time.

3990
03:29:41,239 --> 03:29:43,399
But like my life depends on it.

3991
03:29:44,969 --> 03:29:46,020
Understandable.

3992
03:29:46,020 --> 03:29:48,100
Get in there with your big axe.

3993
03:29:48,100 --> 03:29:50,819
Hey, let me get 50 subs to stab my friend

3994
03:29:50,819 --> 03:29:52,899
I'm streaming with in the head till he dies.

3995
03:29:52,899 --> 03:29:53,780
Dude, like...

3996
03:29:53,780 --> 03:29:54,420
But it's me.

3997
03:29:54,420 --> 03:29:55,059
You started it.

3998
03:29:55,059 --> 03:29:56,420
It's me.

3999
03:29:56,420 --> 03:29:58,340
That's the comedy one.

4000
03:29:58,340 --> 03:29:59,540
I didn't start that.

4001
03:30:02,790 --> 03:30:05,670
There was someone asking for 100 who wasn't me first.

4002
03:30:05,670 --> 03:30:06,389
That's true.

4003
03:30:07,030 --> 03:30:07,750
That's very true.

4004
03:30:07,750 --> 03:30:10,549
Again, a lot of this isn't actually me.

4005
03:30:10,549 --> 03:30:13,079
You just capitalized on it.

4006
03:30:13,079 --> 03:30:14,040
You just capitalized on it.

4007
03:30:14,040 --> 03:30:15,379
All right, you guys ready?

4008
03:30:15,379 --> 03:30:16,780
Yeah.

4009
03:30:16,780 --> 03:30:18,059
Fuck the communists.

4010
03:30:18,059 --> 03:30:18,940
All right, let's go.

4011
03:30:18,940 --> 03:30:20,469
That's what I've always said.

4012
03:30:20,469 --> 03:30:21,110
Exactly.

4013
03:30:21,110 --> 03:30:21,829
Honest to goodness.

4014
03:30:21,829 --> 03:30:27,659
Let's go.

4015
03:30:27,659 --> 03:30:29,100
Dude, are you still mad, dude?

4016
03:30:29,100 --> 03:30:30,379
You still suck at it, bro.

4017
03:30:30,379 --> 03:30:31,979
Everybody in this lot...

4018
03:30:31,979 --> 03:30:35,850
You don't even have time to talk shit.

4019
03:30:35,850 --> 03:30:37,850
Yeah, usually I tell them I'm going to kill everybody

4020
03:30:37,850 --> 03:30:40,180
and then I didn't do that today.

4021
03:30:40,180 --> 03:30:41,940
So this might be a scuffed run.

4022
03:30:41,940 --> 03:30:47,290
I think we're going to be fine.

4023
03:30:50,379 --> 03:30:52,379
I like your way of thinking.

4024
03:30:52,379 --> 03:30:53,979
Beware of interlopers.

4025
03:30:53,979 --> 03:31:00,379
Honest to goodness, we're going to be fine.

4026
03:31:00,379 --> 03:31:02,780
All right, I'm the commanding officer on this mission.

4027
03:31:02,780 --> 03:31:04,700
Leave the fucking lights on so I can hitch...

4028
03:31:04,700 --> 03:31:06,540
Oh, wait, you have no reason to turn off lights now.

4029
03:31:06,540 --> 03:31:07,899
Thank the fucking Lord.

4030
03:31:10,649 --> 03:31:13,770
If I see a light go off, dude, I'm going to know.

4031
03:31:13,770 --> 03:31:14,409
He's going to lose it.

4032
03:31:17,829 --> 03:31:18,549
Praise Jesus.

4033
03:31:20,069 --> 03:31:21,670
It's the arrows bigger than the thing.

4034
03:31:22,489 --> 03:31:22,969
This...

4035
03:31:22,969 --> 03:31:24,010
Wait, wait, I have people already.

4036
03:31:24,010 --> 03:31:25,049
Bro, there are players immediately.

4037
03:31:25,049 --> 03:31:26,090
There are players immediately.

4038
03:31:26,090 --> 03:31:28,090
Oh, typey.

4039
03:31:28,090 --> 03:31:36,489
Oh, good, good, good, good, good.

4040
03:31:36,489 --> 03:31:37,129
Hey, hey, hey.

4041
03:31:37,129 --> 03:31:37,930
Your friend's dead.

4042
03:31:37,930 --> 03:31:38,889
Just come here, just come here.

4043
03:31:38,889 --> 03:31:39,770
The run's over, dude.

4044
03:31:39,770 --> 03:31:40,569
The run's over, bro.

4045
03:31:40,569 --> 03:31:41,049
The run's over.

4046
03:31:41,049 --> 03:31:41,770
Don't listen to him.

4047
03:31:41,770 --> 03:31:42,649
Don't listen to him.

4048
03:31:42,649 --> 03:31:44,329
You should be fighting to the very end.

4049
03:31:44,329 --> 03:31:45,530
Like, that's exactly...

4050
03:31:45,530 --> 03:31:46,649
Good on you, seriously.

4051
03:31:49,209 --> 03:31:49,930
What?

4052
03:31:49,930 --> 03:31:51,770
Jeremy, you caused this.

4053
03:31:51,770 --> 03:31:52,489
I didn't do anything.

4054
03:31:54,379 --> 03:31:55,579
Exactly what I was talking about.

4055
03:31:55,579 --> 03:31:57,020
Exactly what I was talking about.

4056
03:31:57,020 --> 03:31:57,659
You deserve it.

4057
03:32:07,979 --> 03:32:10,459
He hit me through the fucking fence.

4058
03:32:10,459 --> 03:32:11,659
He hit me through the...

4059
03:32:11,659 --> 03:32:13,340
He stabbed me through the fucking...

4060
03:32:20,379 --> 03:32:20,940
I like...

4061
03:32:20,940 --> 03:32:22,700
I don't know how my character works yet.

4062
03:32:22,700 --> 03:32:24,139
I still have so many questions.

4063
03:32:28,709 --> 03:32:29,030
You got...

4064
03:32:29,030 --> 03:32:29,989
This is a government operation.

4065
03:32:29,989 --> 03:32:32,469
Dude, you got obliterated, by the way.

4066
03:32:32,469 --> 03:32:35,510
You turned to look and see down the hall,

4067
03:32:35,510 --> 03:32:37,829
and three arrows instantly killed you.

4068
03:32:38,389 --> 03:32:39,989
Yeah, I know.

4069
03:32:39,989 --> 03:32:40,549
Wait, wait.

4070
03:32:40,549 --> 03:32:41,030
All right, all right.

4071
03:32:41,750 --> 03:32:42,790
What's your skill?

4072
03:32:42,790 --> 03:32:43,510
What's your other skill?

4073
03:32:43,510 --> 03:32:45,909
It needs to be the quick shot, the try shot.

4074
03:32:45,909 --> 03:32:47,030
Yeah, I got quick shot.

4075
03:32:47,829 --> 03:32:50,309
I just want to know if I have to get my arrows back

4076
03:32:50,309 --> 03:32:51,110
and how many I have.

4077
03:32:51,110 --> 03:32:51,590
No, no, no.

4078
03:32:51,590 --> 03:32:52,629
You just reload.

4079
03:32:52,629 --> 03:32:53,829
You have unlimited arrows.

4080
03:32:53,829 --> 03:32:54,149
Okay.

4081
03:32:54,149 --> 03:32:55,190
And if you hit...

4082
03:32:55,190 --> 03:32:56,649
If you just hit head...

4083
03:32:56,649 --> 03:32:59,049
Honest to goodness, can we ready up?

4084
03:32:59,049 --> 03:33:00,170
No, I can't run.

4085
03:33:00,170 --> 03:33:02,649
The bar doesn't make sense without a different weapon.

4086
03:33:02,649 --> 03:33:04,889
So I can actually equip and then I have to get healing.

4087
03:33:04,889 --> 03:33:06,260
Otherwise, I die.

4088
03:33:06,260 --> 03:33:06,579
All right.

4089
03:33:06,579 --> 03:33:07,139
Okay.

4090
03:33:07,139 --> 03:33:08,260
I have a solution.

4091
03:33:12,649 --> 03:33:15,049
Turning off voice chat so I don't have the temptation

4092
03:33:15,049 --> 03:33:16,090
to be like, hey, let me talk to you

4093
03:33:16,090 --> 03:33:17,979
and let's have like a funny thing.

4094
03:33:17,979 --> 03:33:19,340
No, you can talk to them.

4095
03:33:19,340 --> 03:33:21,739
No, no, talk to them, talk to them, talk to them.

4096
03:33:21,739 --> 03:33:21,819
No.

4097
03:33:21,819 --> 03:33:22,379
We should do...

4098
03:33:22,379 --> 03:33:24,059
That way I can laugh while I'm dying.

4099
03:33:24,059 --> 03:33:24,540
Because I'm dying anyway.

4100
03:33:24,540 --> 03:33:26,219
We should mute Discord and only talk in game.

4101
03:33:26,780 --> 03:33:27,819
Oh, that's brilliant.

4102
03:33:27,819 --> 03:33:28,059
No.

4103
03:33:29,899 --> 03:33:31,420
I want to role play around.

4104
03:33:31,420 --> 03:33:32,540
Fine, let's role play.

4105
03:33:32,540 --> 03:33:33,739
You want to role play around?

4106
03:33:33,739 --> 03:33:34,459
Role play around.

4107
03:33:34,459 --> 03:33:35,180
Okay.

4108
03:33:35,180 --> 03:33:36,139
See you guys later.

4109
03:33:36,139 --> 03:33:37,559
All right, they're muted.

4110
03:33:42,579 --> 03:33:52,459
Okay.

4111
03:33:52,459 --> 03:33:56,139
I've got to figure out the right voice for this.

4112
03:33:56,780 --> 03:33:58,379
Oh, I thought...

4113
03:33:58,379 --> 03:33:59,420
The thing is, I think...

4114
03:34:00,139 --> 03:34:07,049
That's a good one.

4115
03:34:07,049 --> 03:34:08,170
Well, I believe.

4116
03:34:08,809 --> 03:34:14,379
I think that's an idea for me.

4117
03:34:15,020 --> 03:34:16,469
I think I'm going to go with this.

4118
03:34:17,930 --> 03:34:19,450
Sounds about right to me.

4119
03:34:19,450 --> 03:34:27,590
Okay.

4120
03:34:27,590 --> 03:34:32,680
Why can't I hear anyone talking?

4121
03:34:32,680 --> 03:34:43,690
Oh, I'd like to see you try.

4122
03:34:43,690 --> 03:34:58,620
Why is nobody talking?

4123
03:34:58,620 --> 03:35:17,290
Nobody's talking.

4124
03:35:17,290 --> 03:35:25,860
Hello.

4125
03:35:26,260 --> 03:35:28,379
Hello.

4126
03:35:28,379 --> 03:35:32,540
Oh, good thing I can hear you now.

4127
03:35:32,540 --> 03:35:34,059
Greetings for our first adventure.

4128
03:35:34,059 --> 03:35:34,780
Hello.

4129
03:35:34,780 --> 03:35:36,420
Can you hear me?

4130
03:35:36,420 --> 03:35:37,459
I am speaking.

4131
03:35:37,459 --> 03:35:38,420
Hello, wizard.

4132
03:35:38,420 --> 03:35:40,250
Watch out for the wizards.

4133
03:35:42,329 --> 03:35:43,770
Great, let's speak.

4134
03:35:43,770 --> 03:35:48,090
Spiders.

4135
03:35:48,889 --> 03:35:51,399
We have to take out the jaw.

4136
03:35:51,399 --> 03:35:55,159
Yeah, the jaw in the corner is the way to stop the spider.

4137
03:35:55,159 --> 03:35:58,309
Be careful behind you.

4138
03:35:58,309 --> 03:36:01,739
Scythe is full.

4139
03:36:01,739 --> 03:36:03,100
Oh, very interesting.

4140
03:36:03,100 --> 03:36:05,110
I'm glad you've told us that.

4141
03:36:05,110 --> 03:36:06,469
More than five times today.

4142
03:36:06,469 --> 03:36:09,590
They're speaking at the braemers.

4143
03:36:09,590 --> 03:36:10,950
Ah, I can't hear you.

4144
03:36:10,950 --> 03:36:13,430
Your helmet muffles your voice.

4145
03:36:13,430 --> 03:36:17,639
Are we ready to continue down this hallway, please?

4146
03:36:18,600 --> 03:36:19,479
Listen to me, boys.

4147
03:36:19,479 --> 03:36:20,680
Boys, listen.

4148
03:36:20,680 --> 03:36:22,040
Oh, why do I sound so smart?

4149
03:36:23,000 --> 03:36:25,239
There's exquisitely leaves over here in the library.

4150
03:36:25,239 --> 03:36:26,840
Come here, come here.

4151
03:36:26,840 --> 03:36:28,520
Oh, the library, yes.

4152
03:36:28,520 --> 03:36:30,200
Plenty of books.

4153
03:36:33,479 --> 03:36:35,079
I remember reading this one.

4154
03:36:36,280 --> 03:36:37,399
That's a good one.

4155
03:36:37,399 --> 03:36:40,840
This is an encyclopedia of all the dragons that are in this world.

4156
03:36:40,840 --> 03:36:42,100
Have you read it?

4157
03:36:42,100 --> 03:36:52,059
The dragon, despite my upbringing, I can't read.

4158
03:36:52,059 --> 03:36:52,780
Those are made.

4159
03:36:52,780 --> 03:36:55,020
We must go to fight to loot.

4160
03:36:55,020 --> 03:36:55,659
Made here.

4161
03:37:07,110 --> 03:37:08,069
Nice, nice.

4162
03:37:08,069 --> 03:37:08,629
Excellent.

4163
03:37:08,629 --> 03:37:09,030
Excellent.

4164
03:37:09,030 --> 03:37:10,229
Below me.

4165
03:37:10,229 --> 03:37:10,629
Excellent.

4166
03:37:10,629 --> 03:37:11,030
Below.

4167
03:37:11,030 --> 03:37:12,229
Crystal sword here.

4168
03:37:12,790 --> 03:37:15,579
It was top drawer, if I must say.

4169
03:37:15,579 --> 03:37:22,459
I'm going to go over here.

4170
03:37:22,459 --> 03:37:25,979
I'm going to get the spider into loafers, you say.

4171
03:37:26,620 --> 03:37:30,579
I need to get rid of this.

4172
03:37:41,340 --> 03:37:46,809
So, Diope, what are you talking about?

4173
03:37:46,809 --> 03:37:47,930
Make sure you get the jewels.

4174
03:37:49,610 --> 03:37:55,110
Turn oblivion music on.

4175
03:37:55,750 --> 03:37:56,069
Okay.

4176
03:38:08,700 --> 03:38:09,899
Jesus Christ!

4177
03:38:14,409 --> 03:38:15,290
What the fuck?

4178
03:38:15,290 --> 03:38:18,459
My God, why was it like that?

4179
03:38:19,579 --> 03:38:20,780
Oh, my God.

4180
03:38:24,440 --> 03:38:25,479
Oh, my goodness.

4181
03:38:27,579 --> 03:38:29,420
Sorry, a very loud thing happened.

4182
03:38:40,500 --> 03:38:42,020
Why is it so loud?

4183
03:38:42,020 --> 03:38:42,659
I don't get it.

4184
03:38:51,799 --> 03:38:52,760
Demons of the mind.

4185
03:38:54,969 --> 03:38:55,770
Look at his eyes.

4186
03:38:56,409 --> 03:38:57,530
There's not much behind me.

4187
03:38:57,530 --> 03:38:59,049
All right, gentlemen, I'm ready.

4188
03:38:59,049 --> 03:39:00,329
I'm a female.

4189
03:39:00,329 --> 03:39:00,969
I'm a female.

4190
03:39:04,100 --> 03:39:05,059
Yes, I am ready.

4191
03:39:06,379 --> 03:39:06,940
Onwards.

4192
03:39:09,350 --> 03:39:10,709
Bass, get your wits about you.

4193
03:39:11,590 --> 03:39:12,389
I'm very on.

4194
03:39:12,389 --> 03:39:12,950
Various challenges.

4195
03:39:13,750 --> 03:39:14,469
All right.

4196
03:39:14,469 --> 03:39:15,670
Are we ready to take off?

4197
03:39:15,670 --> 03:39:16,229
And demons.

4198
03:39:17,899 --> 03:39:18,379
Here we go.

4199
03:39:18,379 --> 03:39:18,860
Let's go.

4200
03:39:19,780 --> 03:39:20,500
Here we go.

4201
03:39:20,500 --> 03:39:21,379
This way, follow me.

4202
03:39:21,379 --> 03:39:23,979
This is a room, squiz of treasures.

4203
03:39:27,930 --> 03:39:30,620
Long ago, this exact cave.

4204
03:39:31,420 --> 03:39:37,739
It was filled with treasures, laughter, music, family.

4205
03:39:37,739 --> 03:39:39,020
I've been here before.

4206
03:39:39,020 --> 03:39:39,979
Yes, many times.

4207
03:39:39,979 --> 03:39:40,780
This is my home.

4208
03:39:40,780 --> 03:39:42,139
I've been here recently.

4209
03:39:42,780 --> 03:39:43,500
Very recently.

4210
03:39:44,860 --> 03:39:50,569
But now, ever since the dragon fire, it's all but nothing.

4211
03:39:55,940 --> 03:39:57,459
Footsteps in the distance.

4212
03:39:57,459 --> 03:40:00,969
The dark sounds upon the cement.

4213
03:40:01,989 --> 03:40:04,069
I don't know what could be in these halls,

4214
03:40:04,069 --> 03:40:06,520
but prepare for anything.

4215
03:40:11,799 --> 03:40:13,590
Wait a minute.

4216
03:40:13,670 --> 03:40:16,459
Alas, a room full of treasures.

4217
03:40:17,379 --> 03:40:18,340
Oh, yes.

4218
03:40:18,340 --> 03:40:19,620
I just remembered.

4219
03:40:19,620 --> 03:40:19,940
What is it?

4220
03:40:19,940 --> 03:40:21,620
I left my oven on.

4221
03:40:21,620 --> 03:40:23,139
There be an archer.

4222
03:40:23,139 --> 03:40:23,700
Watch out.

4223
03:40:24,579 --> 03:40:26,260
It'll get you outside.

4224
03:40:26,260 --> 03:40:29,620
What have they done to my father's old study?

4225
03:40:32,420 --> 03:40:37,129
These absolute disgusting zombies,

4226
03:40:37,129 --> 03:40:41,139
and probably too dangerous in here now.

4227
03:40:41,940 --> 03:40:43,379
Me, don't get too close.

4228
03:40:45,110 --> 03:40:45,750
It's a diaphe.

4229
03:40:47,059 --> 03:40:47,860
You had a-

4230
03:40:47,860 --> 03:40:50,340
I have remembered ovens weren't invented yet.

4231
03:40:50,340 --> 03:40:50,979
That's correct.

4232
03:40:50,979 --> 03:40:57,139
I don't know why you're saying these things this way.

4233
03:41:00,840 --> 03:41:06,579
Long ago, my father created a series of traps

4234
03:41:07,219 --> 03:41:10,420
to protect this very room and these very halls

4235
03:41:10,420 --> 03:41:12,579
from interlopers like us.

4236
03:41:12,579 --> 03:41:15,459
It's ironic considering that we're trying to-

4237
03:41:15,459 --> 03:41:16,340
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

4238
03:41:16,979 --> 03:41:17,860
I'm sorry.

4239
03:41:17,860 --> 03:41:21,059
What were we thinking coming in here without shoes?

4240
03:41:21,059 --> 03:41:22,100
Yes, it's very strange.

4241
03:41:22,100 --> 03:41:22,899
I have shoes.

4242
03:41:23,780 --> 03:41:26,520
It's like men being unprepared.

4243
03:41:26,520 --> 03:41:29,000
We have shoes right here.

4244
03:41:29,000 --> 03:41:29,879
If you want shoes,

4245
03:41:30,520 --> 03:41:35,350
I want to feel the cold stone on my bare feet.

4246
03:41:35,350 --> 03:41:38,340
Curious.

4247
03:41:38,340 --> 03:41:40,100
Very curious indeed.

4248
03:41:40,100 --> 03:41:43,459
Trying to get to my old room.

4249
03:41:43,459 --> 03:41:48,459
Unfortunately, it's been destroyed.

4250
03:41:48,459 --> 03:41:50,360
You know, did you live here?

4251
03:41:50,360 --> 03:41:51,239
I did.

4252
03:41:51,239 --> 03:41:52,040
Many years ago.

4253
03:41:54,329 --> 03:41:55,049
Skeleton.

4254
03:41:55,049 --> 03:41:55,530
Skeleton.

4255
03:41:55,530 --> 03:41:56,969
We reanimated undead.

4256
03:41:58,010 --> 03:41:58,649
Surprise it.

4257
03:41:59,209 --> 03:42:00,489
Shoot his face.

4258
03:42:01,770 --> 03:42:04,090
I live in dreams.

4259
03:42:05,129 --> 03:42:05,930
Oh, my neck.

4260
03:42:07,049 --> 03:42:07,930
Oh, my neck.

4261
03:42:07,930 --> 03:42:14,809
Oh, that hurt.

4262
03:42:17,290 --> 03:42:18,409
Attack, please.

4263
03:42:21,850 --> 03:42:24,299
Never mind.

4264
03:42:24,299 --> 03:42:25,260
We're not going down there.

4265
03:42:27,260 --> 03:42:27,979
It's a diapoe.

4266
03:42:32,260 --> 03:42:33,059
It's a diapoe.

4267
03:42:33,700 --> 03:42:38,489
It's very scary coming down these halls once again.

4268
03:42:39,290 --> 03:42:41,340
It's a diapoe.

4269
03:42:41,340 --> 03:42:41,979
What's happening?

4270
03:42:45,690 --> 03:42:46,569
Adventure, a friend.

4271
03:42:46,569 --> 03:42:47,530
What are you doing?

4272
03:42:47,530 --> 03:42:48,409
Stop, stop, stop.

4273
03:42:49,450 --> 03:42:50,969
Do you have a history in these halls as well?

4274
03:42:54,920 --> 03:42:57,639
I must know if there are other people here.

4275
03:42:57,639 --> 03:42:59,159
My family depends on it.

4276
03:43:03,399 --> 03:43:03,879
Wizard.

4277
03:43:06,659 --> 03:43:07,139
Wizard.

4278
03:43:09,129 --> 03:43:11,850
Oh, another one lost to the dungeon.

4279
03:43:13,209 --> 03:43:14,250
Where did that wizard go?

4280
03:43:19,110 --> 03:43:20,069
There was a wizard here,

4281
03:43:20,069 --> 03:43:21,750
and he might have the secrets of my family.

4282
03:43:22,309 --> 03:43:24,469
It could even be somebody from my family.

4283
03:43:25,780 --> 03:43:26,420
We must know.

4284
03:43:26,420 --> 03:43:27,059
We must find...

4285
03:43:30,819 --> 03:43:31,219
Hello?

4286
03:43:32,500 --> 03:43:33,379
Wizard, it's all right.

4287
03:43:36,739 --> 03:43:37,620
He's a blacksmith.

4288
03:43:39,530 --> 03:43:42,010
He built this entire castle with his bare hands.

4289
03:43:42,569 --> 03:43:44,100
I don't want to...

4290
03:43:52,280 --> 03:43:53,639
He was paid very well.

4291
03:43:53,639 --> 03:43:57,879
Fortunately, he didn't make it through the war.

4292
03:43:57,879 --> 03:43:59,399
The war, he did not make it through the war.

4293
03:43:59,399 --> 03:44:00,840
Have you seen our friends today?

4294
03:44:01,479 --> 03:44:02,600
Do you know where he is?

4295
03:44:03,719 --> 03:44:08,180
Adventurer, do you have business in these halls?

4296
03:44:08,180 --> 03:44:09,860
I am looking for an exit.

4297
03:44:09,860 --> 03:44:11,940
Perhaps there will be an exit for all of us.

4298
03:44:11,940 --> 03:44:13,219
There will be, potentially.

4299
03:44:15,219 --> 03:44:16,260
How did you get in?

4300
03:44:16,260 --> 03:44:16,979
What's your name?

4301
03:44:17,620 --> 03:44:18,500
What is your name, Traveller?

4302
03:44:18,500 --> 03:44:20,659
The butler let me in.

4303
03:44:20,659 --> 03:44:22,180
You see, I work here,

4304
03:44:22,180 --> 03:44:24,979
but I've came through a lot on my way out.

4305
03:44:25,940 --> 03:44:27,139
Another adventurer, please.

4306
03:44:27,780 --> 03:44:28,819
Let us all come together

4307
03:44:28,819 --> 03:44:30,100
and discuss what's happening here.

4308
03:44:30,100 --> 03:44:32,819
I'm trying to find my family's secrets.

4309
03:44:34,899 --> 03:44:35,780
There was an accident.

4310
03:44:35,780 --> 03:44:36,500
I didn't mean it.

4311
03:44:36,500 --> 03:44:37,459
I'm sorry.

4312
03:44:37,459 --> 03:44:51,690
A blue portal has arrived.

4313
03:44:51,690 --> 03:44:52,170
All right.

4314
03:44:52,809 --> 03:44:55,770
If there are any interlopers here in my family's castle,

4315
03:44:55,770 --> 03:44:58,979
just be aware I am not going to go down so easily.

4316
03:44:58,979 --> 03:45:00,819
My father built this tunnel,

4317
03:45:00,819 --> 03:45:03,139
built these halls with his bare hands.

4318
03:45:03,139 --> 03:45:04,790
Just so you know,

4319
03:45:04,790 --> 03:45:06,549
I am ready to fight for my family

4320
03:45:06,549 --> 03:45:07,590
and for what they have built

4321
03:45:07,590 --> 03:45:08,389
and what they have done.

4322
03:45:08,950 --> 03:45:09,829
Do you understand?

4323
03:45:10,549 --> 03:45:12,309
Are you friend or are you foe?

4324
03:45:20,149 --> 03:45:20,870
He's a friend.

4325
03:45:20,870 --> 03:45:21,590
He's a friend.

4326
03:45:21,590 --> 03:45:21,989
He's a friend.

4327
03:45:21,989 --> 03:45:22,389
Let him be.

4328
03:45:25,159 --> 03:45:27,239
Look into the fire and tell me what your name is.

4329
03:45:28,280 --> 03:45:28,680
Stop.

4330
03:45:28,680 --> 03:45:29,079
Stop.

4331
03:45:29,079 --> 03:45:29,719
Stop.

4332
03:45:29,719 --> 03:45:30,520
Stop.

4333
03:45:30,520 --> 03:45:30,840
Stop.

4334
03:45:33,239 --> 03:45:34,360
You violated the law.

4335
03:45:35,319 --> 03:45:35,719
Stop.

4336
03:45:35,719 --> 03:45:36,680
You violated the law.

4337
03:45:36,680 --> 03:45:39,079
Pay the penalty or rot in prison, scum.

4338
03:45:43,579 --> 03:45:44,079
Stop.

4339
03:45:44,860 --> 03:45:45,360
Stop.

4340
03:45:54,569 --> 03:45:55,690
Oh, shit.

4341
03:45:55,690 --> 03:45:58,170
What do I do?

4342
03:45:58,489 --> 03:46:00,600
There's no adventurers to talk to.

4343
03:46:00,600 --> 03:46:02,360
There's no players to interact with.

4344
03:46:03,000 --> 03:46:06,709
What happens when an NPC has no-

4345
03:46:06,709 --> 03:46:07,030
Me.

4346
03:46:07,030 --> 03:46:07,829
Can you hear me?

4347
03:46:08,469 --> 03:46:08,950
Me.

4348
03:46:08,950 --> 03:46:10,309
It is me, Kongraza.

4349
03:46:10,309 --> 03:46:11,510
Why can I still hear you?

4350
03:46:11,510 --> 03:46:13,510
And why did you say your name correctly

4351
03:46:13,510 --> 03:46:15,030
instead of the French way?

4352
03:46:15,030 --> 03:46:18,940
Sorry for what you had to see.

4353
03:46:18,940 --> 03:46:19,979
Why can I hear you?

4354
03:46:19,979 --> 03:46:21,340
Just know that I will always love you.

4355
03:46:21,340 --> 03:46:25,979
Why can I hear you?

4356
03:46:25,979 --> 03:46:26,940
I'm always with you.

4357
03:46:29,690 --> 03:46:31,930
Mitch, you didn't get any of those hot hits on me

4358
03:46:31,930 --> 03:46:32,430
because you suck.

4359
03:46:34,729 --> 03:46:42,069
Is there anyone left?

4360
03:46:45,579 --> 03:46:46,860
Is there anyone left?

4361
03:46:47,420 --> 03:46:54,149
Please tell me there's someone left.

4362
03:46:54,149 --> 03:46:54,649
Someone.

4363
03:46:55,270 --> 03:46:56,790
A final adventurer, perhaps.

4364
03:46:57,430 --> 03:46:59,770
A final adventurer to talk to me

4365
03:46:59,770 --> 03:47:02,090
and give me one final quest before I die.

4366
03:47:03,590 --> 03:47:04,090
Please.

4367
03:47:04,709 --> 03:47:06,309
Give an old man something.

4368
03:47:06,309 --> 03:47:20,629
I made it.

4369
03:47:20,629 --> 03:47:30,540
I didn't make it.

4370
03:47:30,540 --> 03:47:33,850
How did I-

4371
03:47:33,850 --> 03:47:35,780
I didn't make it.

4372
03:47:35,780 --> 03:47:38,100
Don't you tell me you just died in the darkness.

4373
03:47:38,100 --> 03:47:38,739
I was trying-

4374
03:47:38,739 --> 03:47:40,260
I was hoping somebody was-

4375
03:47:40,260 --> 03:47:42,579
I was hoping somebody was going to show up and be like-

4376
03:47:42,579 --> 03:47:43,940
Because there was two people left.

4377
03:47:43,940 --> 03:47:48,780
I can hear you through it.

4378
03:47:48,780 --> 03:47:52,600
There's a lot of audio jungle.

4379
03:47:55,350 --> 03:47:57,100
Is it better?

4380
03:47:57,100 --> 03:48:01,559
Also, your mic, it might be like a webcam mic or something.

4381
03:48:01,559 --> 03:48:05,500
I could not understand a word that QuamCuzzler was saying.

4382
03:48:05,500 --> 03:48:06,379
I couldn't either.

4383
03:48:07,420 --> 03:48:08,299
I heard like-

4384
03:48:08,299 --> 03:48:09,100
I heard like-

4385
03:48:09,100 --> 03:48:11,819
Like something about like hot pockets in it.

4386
03:48:11,819 --> 03:48:15,139
You didn't say hot pockets once.

4387
03:48:15,139 --> 03:48:16,659
You didn't say hot pockets?

4388
03:48:18,790 --> 03:48:20,549
Who said they were eating a hot pocket?

4389
03:48:24,840 --> 03:48:25,639
Bro, I was-

4390
03:48:25,639 --> 03:48:26,139
I literally-

4391
03:48:27,000 --> 03:48:30,200
I roleplayed and I forgot that I was a girl in the game

4392
03:48:30,200 --> 03:48:31,479
and I just was like midway through.

4393
03:48:31,479 --> 03:48:34,360
I just formed a romantic relationship with you and you're-

4394
03:48:34,360 --> 03:48:36,120
At no point did I say hot pockets.

4395
03:48:36,680 --> 03:48:37,799
Your microphone was-

4396
03:48:37,799 --> 03:48:39,000
It was so funny because it was-

4397
03:48:41,209 --> 03:48:43,370
The people that we were interacting with,

4398
03:48:43,370 --> 03:48:44,489
I don't think I could hear what you were saying.

4399
03:48:44,489 --> 03:48:45,610
So you were just kind of like-

4400
03:48:47,530 --> 03:48:49,290
And I'm just like, adventure, please.

4401
03:48:49,290 --> 03:48:54,020
This RP brought you-

4402
03:48:55,819 --> 03:48:56,319
Wow.

4403
03:48:57,180 --> 03:48:59,100
Oh, I lost a good sword, I think.

4404
03:48:59,100 --> 03:48:59,659
Oh, whatever.

4405
03:48:59,659 --> 03:49:01,659
The game is over in three days.

4406
03:49:01,899 --> 03:49:03,209
Let me-

4407
03:49:04,229 --> 03:49:07,620
But at the end there, was there somebody left?

4408
03:49:07,620 --> 03:49:10,780
There was one person left at the very end.

4409
03:49:10,780 --> 03:49:11,280
Was I?

4410
03:49:11,899 --> 03:49:12,780
Yeah.

4411
03:49:12,780 --> 03:49:14,379
It said there were two.

4412
03:49:15,379 --> 03:49:17,219
It was like two slots.

4413
03:49:17,219 --> 03:49:21,620
So were people potentially just spectating me walking around?

4414
03:49:21,620 --> 03:49:24,819
Like having like a sad NPC ending?

4415
03:49:26,100 --> 03:49:28,620
Probably.

4416
03:49:28,620 --> 03:49:31,020
I mean, that's a great way to go out, I'd say.

4417
03:49:31,020 --> 03:49:32,219
I mean, that was the circle.

4418
03:49:32,219 --> 03:49:33,420
There was no one else there.

4419
03:49:33,420 --> 03:49:39,290
All right, let me know if this is better now.

4420
03:49:39,290 --> 03:49:42,340
Is my in-game audio better now?

4421
03:49:42,340 --> 03:49:44,010
I don't hear it in-game.

4422
03:49:44,010 --> 03:49:44,729
Oh, that's amazing.

4423
03:49:44,729 --> 03:49:45,610
All right, I have proposition.

4424
03:49:46,729 --> 03:49:50,340
But sometimes I hear Jerma through your mic.

4425
03:49:51,459 --> 03:49:56,360
It also looks like my thing is active, but mine isn't active.

4426
03:49:59,979 --> 03:50:03,299
Also, I've been trying to get an answer to this question for a while,

4427
03:50:03,299 --> 03:50:04,340
but I keep forgetting.

4428
03:50:04,340 --> 03:50:08,180
When I'm crouching and I'm trying to interact pressing F on something

4429
03:50:08,180 --> 03:50:10,340
to like pick up an item, it won't work.

4430
03:50:10,340 --> 03:50:14,620
I have to stand up to pick up an item.

4431
03:50:14,620 --> 03:50:16,219
I have never heard of that for anybody else.

4432
03:50:18,149 --> 03:50:18,950
Yeah, that's weird.

4433
03:50:19,829 --> 03:50:20,709
It's a little buggy, though.

4434
03:50:20,709 --> 03:50:22,709
Sometimes, I don't know if it's happening to you guys, too,

4435
03:50:22,709 --> 03:50:26,629
but sometimes I will like click to swing and nothing happens.

4436
03:50:26,629 --> 03:50:29,270
Yeah, there's also like an auto swing problem that people have.

4437
03:50:29,270 --> 03:50:31,350
There's, you know, we don't talk about them.

4438
03:50:31,350 --> 03:50:33,030
Okay, it's okay.

4439
03:50:33,030 --> 03:50:33,909
It's all right.

4440
03:50:33,909 --> 03:50:34,709
It happens, yeah.

4441
03:50:35,510 --> 03:50:36,950
It's just some strange things.

4442
03:50:36,950 --> 03:50:39,829
Shift makes you unable to interact sometimes, apparently.

4443
03:50:39,829 --> 03:50:40,950
Yeah, wait, are you?

4444
03:50:40,950 --> 03:50:45,350
Yeah, your crouch is bound to control, correct?

4445
03:50:45,350 --> 03:50:48,180
Left control?

4446
03:50:48,180 --> 03:50:48,979
Mine is left control.

4447
03:50:48,979 --> 03:50:49,780
Left shift.

4448
03:50:49,780 --> 03:50:50,340
Well, there you go.

4449
03:50:50,340 --> 03:50:51,299
Yeah, to get it off shift,

4450
03:50:52,100 --> 03:50:53,059
you're probably double bound.

4451
03:50:56,040 --> 03:50:57,959
The game's probably not recognizing

4452
03:50:57,959 --> 03:51:00,120
that you're double bound and not changing that for you.

4453
03:51:00,120 --> 03:51:02,040
My jump button is also right click,

4454
03:51:02,040 --> 03:51:05,639
so when I'm in the game transferring items over to my inventory,

4455
03:51:05,639 --> 03:51:07,479
I jump every time I transfer an item.

4456
03:51:07,479 --> 03:51:12,280
Sir, you've been using the like tribes ascend control scheme,

4457
03:51:12,280 --> 03:51:14,780
haven't you, for like the last 10 years?

4458
03:51:14,780 --> 03:51:16,940
Yeah, I'm a mouse to jumper.

4459
03:51:16,940 --> 03:51:22,500
That's actually like kind of efficient, but also what's wrong with you?

4460
03:51:22,500 --> 03:51:26,180
I mean, I like it, and I enjoy it,

4461
03:51:26,180 --> 03:51:29,909
and it doesn't work in a lot of games.

4462
03:51:29,909 --> 03:51:31,909
I feel like I've done mouse wheel jump,

4463
03:51:31,909 --> 03:51:33,190
but I've never done right click.

4464
03:51:33,190 --> 03:51:34,709
I mean, that's you do you, man.

4465
03:51:34,709 --> 03:51:36,840
All right, let's get it.

4466
03:51:36,840 --> 03:51:39,079
I feel like it's been an hour since we've played the video game.

4467
03:51:40,440 --> 03:51:42,329
All right, you guys ready?

4468
03:51:42,329 --> 03:51:44,729
I'm trying, but I'm mostly just sitting in this lobby

4469
03:51:44,729 --> 03:51:46,010
waiting for you guys to ready.

4470
03:51:46,010 --> 03:51:47,290
That's been my experience.

4471
03:51:47,290 --> 03:51:48,489
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.

4472
03:51:48,489 --> 03:51:50,010
No, you need to hurry up.

4473
03:51:50,010 --> 03:51:52,920
Get your ass in the game.

4474
03:51:52,920 --> 03:51:53,639
All right, first of all.

4475
03:51:53,639 --> 03:51:54,040
This is the one.

4476
03:51:55,020 --> 03:51:57,979
Most of this has been me getting here for you guys.

4477
03:51:57,979 --> 03:51:59,819
Hello, friend.

4478
03:51:59,819 --> 03:52:00,139
Hello.

4479
03:52:00,139 --> 03:52:00,459
Hello.

4480
03:52:00,459 --> 03:52:01,739
Can you hear me?

4481
03:52:01,739 --> 03:52:03,850
Is my audio?

4482
03:52:03,850 --> 03:52:04,250
Never.

4483
03:52:04,250 --> 03:52:05,209
That's never enough.

4484
03:52:05,209 --> 03:52:06,649
I just turned off in game.

4485
03:52:06,649 --> 03:52:07,610
It was being really weird,

4486
03:52:07,610 --> 03:52:09,770
and I kept hearing Jerma talk through like your mic.

4487
03:52:09,770 --> 03:52:12,149
That's very strange.

4488
03:52:12,149 --> 03:52:13,110
I thought I just turned it off, too.

4489
03:52:13,110 --> 03:52:13,670
That's weird.

4490
03:52:13,670 --> 03:52:18,120
Yeah, I know.

4491
03:52:18,120 --> 03:52:18,840
I can't hear anything.

4492
03:52:22,139 --> 03:52:23,819
All right, yours are actually bleeding.

4493
03:52:23,819 --> 03:52:24,700
Gamer time.

4494
03:52:24,700 --> 03:52:26,780
Wait, does that give you that little notification

4495
03:52:26,780 --> 03:52:29,059
that I'm muting and unmuting?

4496
03:52:29,059 --> 03:52:30,020
Oh, okay, good.

4497
03:52:30,020 --> 03:52:32,260
I thought when you said bleeding, I muted and unmuted.

4498
03:52:32,260 --> 03:52:35,079
Rapier for you, Sir DiPy.

4499
03:52:35,079 --> 03:52:36,600
So you have a melee in between.

4500
03:52:36,600 --> 03:52:37,639
Otherwise, it's really annoying.

4501
03:52:37,639 --> 03:52:38,600
Also, take this.

4502
03:52:38,600 --> 03:52:39,000
It is.

4503
03:52:40,360 --> 03:52:40,760
I know.

4504
03:52:40,760 --> 03:52:42,100
I played Ranger.

4505
03:52:42,100 --> 03:52:44,020
I took your battle axe as well.

4506
03:52:44,020 --> 03:52:44,659
Yep.

4507
03:52:44,659 --> 03:52:46,340
I don't know if you can use that, but have fun.

4508
03:52:46,340 --> 03:52:48,180
I murdered your toys this way.

4509
03:52:48,180 --> 03:52:49,059
Oh, thanks for the shoes,

4510
03:52:49,059 --> 03:52:50,899
because my feet really were getting super dirty

4511
03:52:50,899 --> 03:52:52,889
walking around down here.

4512
03:52:52,889 --> 03:52:55,690
I want to keep those dogs clean.

4513
03:52:55,690 --> 03:52:56,090
All right.

4514
03:52:56,090 --> 03:52:57,819
This is loud, too.

4515
03:53:07,700 --> 03:53:14,790
I'm going to shoot.

4516
03:53:14,790 --> 03:53:15,430
That hit you.

4517
03:53:16,069 --> 03:53:17,270
What is?

4518
03:53:17,270 --> 03:53:17,829
Oh, my God.

4519
03:53:17,829 --> 03:53:18,309
What's happening?

4520
03:53:18,309 --> 03:53:19,909
What the fuck is going on here?

4521
03:53:19,909 --> 03:53:21,690
The Rangers are nuts.

4522
03:53:21,690 --> 03:53:22,090
No, no, no.

4523
03:53:22,090 --> 03:53:24,489
I thought that was you behind me.

4524
03:53:24,489 --> 03:53:25,530
That was weird.

4525
03:53:25,530 --> 03:53:26,030
Ow.

4526
03:53:27,610 --> 03:53:29,049
Do you want me to be behind you?

4527
03:53:29,049 --> 03:53:30,260
I can get there.

4528
03:53:30,260 --> 03:53:31,459
Oh, Jesus.

4529
03:53:31,459 --> 03:53:32,100
Be careful.

4530
03:53:32,100 --> 03:53:34,809
I thought you were behind me.

4531
03:53:34,809 --> 03:53:36,569
No, I was told to be in front,

4532
03:53:36,569 --> 03:53:38,680
which I'm probably going to get shot in the back of the head,

4533
03:53:38,680 --> 03:53:39,399
but I'm ready for it.

4534
03:53:39,399 --> 03:53:40,489
I am.

4535
03:53:40,489 --> 03:53:41,690
I'm a gamer.

4536
03:53:41,690 --> 03:53:42,809
I won't do that.

4537
03:53:42,809 --> 03:53:46,010
I can tell from the right click mouse button jump thing,

4538
03:53:46,010 --> 03:53:46,489
whatever that is.

4539
03:53:46,489 --> 03:53:52,950
Yeah, that was what truly identifies me as a gamer.

4540
03:53:52,950 --> 03:53:54,440
Nice.

4541
03:53:54,440 --> 03:53:55,239
He's gaming.

4542
03:53:55,239 --> 03:53:55,959
This bat's in here.

4543
03:53:55,959 --> 03:53:57,319
Why are the lights off?

4544
03:53:57,319 --> 03:53:58,760
Why are the lights off?

4545
03:53:58,760 --> 03:53:59,719
Explain this to me.

4546
03:53:59,719 --> 03:54:00,760
I have a shitty room.

4547
03:54:00,760 --> 03:54:01,879
Interact speed.

4548
03:54:01,879 --> 03:54:02,520
All right, all right.

4549
03:54:02,520 --> 03:54:04,600
This room is rough because there's a wraith here

4550
03:54:04,600 --> 03:54:07,399
and I have a shitty weapon for this.

4551
03:54:07,399 --> 03:54:08,920
So we're going to turn around.

4552
03:54:08,920 --> 03:54:10,120
Executive decision, I'm sorry.

4553
03:54:10,120 --> 03:54:12,440
No, that room is actually a hell.

4554
03:54:12,440 --> 03:54:13,159
Worth it.

4555
03:54:13,159 --> 03:54:13,639
Yeah.

4556
03:54:13,639 --> 03:54:16,299
Like, if you have a cleric, it's fine.

4557
03:54:16,299 --> 03:54:20,600
But oh, fun thing, if you guys want to try it,

4558
03:54:20,600 --> 03:54:22,440
you can do a brewmaster cleric

4559
03:54:22,440 --> 03:54:23,959
and you can drink beer to give you

4560
03:54:23,959 --> 03:54:26,520
plus like 11 strength for 15 seconds.

4561
03:54:26,520 --> 03:54:28,520
And you can literally just bite you with your fist

4562
03:54:28,520 --> 03:54:29,639
and actually down them.

4563
03:54:29,639 --> 03:54:31,690
You don't get drunk from it, right?

4564
03:54:31,690 --> 03:54:32,409
Yep.

4565
03:54:32,409 --> 03:54:35,590
It's a lot of fun.

4566
03:54:35,590 --> 03:54:38,489
All right, I got friends up here.

4567
03:54:38,489 --> 03:54:39,290
Let's go.

4568
03:54:39,290 --> 03:54:52,899
Oh, nice doc.

4569
03:54:54,500 --> 03:54:55,879
Thanks, dude.

4570
03:54:55,879 --> 03:54:57,959
Oh, hey, man, there's some sick loot on there for you.

4571
03:54:57,959 --> 03:54:58,520
There it was.

4572
03:54:58,520 --> 03:55:00,940
It was a lot of money.

4573
03:55:00,940 --> 03:55:01,180
Oh, great work.

4574
03:55:01,180 --> 03:55:03,340
I have a buckler over here if you want.

4575
03:55:03,340 --> 03:55:04,299
If you're into that sort of thing.

4576
03:55:05,659 --> 03:55:08,950
What's the difference between longbow shortbow?

4577
03:55:08,950 --> 03:55:11,030
Any significant thing I should be aware of?

4578
03:55:12,389 --> 03:55:14,709
So the recurve bow, I know you can fire faster.

4579
03:55:14,709 --> 03:55:15,909
How many arrows do you have on the recurve?

4580
03:55:15,909 --> 03:55:18,620
Is it six or five or six?

4581
03:55:18,620 --> 03:55:20,059
Yeah, so I think a longbow, you get five,

4582
03:55:20,059 --> 03:55:22,620
but it's like 40 damage, usually 30 to 40 damage.

4583
03:55:23,500 --> 03:55:25,420
It do be looking like a lot of damage.

4584
03:55:25,420 --> 03:55:28,540
Stirrer, you're going to want this on the ground right now.

4585
03:55:28,540 --> 03:55:32,250
That's an unbelievably good bow.

4586
03:55:32,250 --> 03:55:33,129
Is it a survival bow?

4587
03:55:33,129 --> 03:55:34,010
Please don't be a survival bow.

4588
03:55:34,010 --> 03:55:34,569
It's a blue.

4589
03:55:35,639 --> 03:55:36,200
Where?

4590
03:55:36,200 --> 03:55:37,639
Yeah, but if it's a blue survival bow,

4591
03:55:37,639 --> 03:55:38,840
it's just actually to tease.

4592
03:55:38,840 --> 03:55:40,389
Put it on the ground?

4593
03:55:40,389 --> 03:55:41,110
Oh, no.

4594
03:55:41,829 --> 03:55:43,590
Oh, boys, this might be one of the...

4595
03:55:43,590 --> 03:55:45,719
Wait, hopefully it's in the...

4596
03:55:45,719 --> 03:55:46,520
Oh, no.

4597
03:55:46,520 --> 03:55:47,780
What happened?

4598
03:55:47,780 --> 03:55:49,379
It might be in the texture.

4599
03:55:49,379 --> 03:55:51,459
See how there's the actual barrier.

4600
03:55:51,459 --> 03:55:52,340
I got it, I got it, I got it.

4601
03:55:52,340 --> 03:55:53,379
Oh, thank God.

4602
03:55:53,379 --> 03:55:53,860
I got it.

4603
03:55:53,860 --> 03:55:55,459
Yeah, there's a little piece sticking out.

4604
03:55:55,459 --> 03:55:56,600
There you go.

4605
03:55:56,600 --> 03:55:57,719
Oh, this is perfect.

4606
03:55:57,719 --> 03:55:59,639
Oh, bless the heavens.

4607
03:55:59,639 --> 03:56:00,760
We're gaming again.

4608
03:56:00,760 --> 03:56:03,079
I think it should be really good.

4609
03:56:03,079 --> 03:56:04,440
That's more damage than the longbow.

4610
03:56:04,440 --> 03:56:04,920
Yeah.

4611
03:56:04,920 --> 03:56:09,180
I think some bows have different amount of arrows too, right?

4612
03:56:09,180 --> 03:56:09,739
Yeah, yeah.

4613
03:56:10,459 --> 03:56:13,500
So anyways, longbow can obviously shoot longer.

4614
03:56:13,500 --> 03:56:16,459
It's a bigger bow and then that'll shoot quicker.

4615
03:56:16,459 --> 03:56:17,420
Recurves are really good.

4616
03:56:17,420 --> 03:56:18,780
This is just the same shitty room.

4617
03:56:18,780 --> 03:56:20,139
Yeah, this is literally the same room.

4618
03:56:20,139 --> 03:56:21,180
We can run through it.

4619
03:56:21,180 --> 03:56:21,979
It's just...

4620
03:56:21,979 --> 03:56:23,819
I have my fear up.

4621
03:56:23,819 --> 03:56:26,299
It's just risky-ish, but...

4622
03:56:26,299 --> 03:56:28,139
I mean, we don't really have...

4623
03:56:28,139 --> 03:56:29,500
We'd have to run all the way around.

4624
03:56:29,500 --> 03:56:31,219
Yeah, we can do this.

4625
03:56:31,219 --> 03:56:32,180
We're gamers.

4626
03:56:32,180 --> 03:56:34,870
Yeah, you can shoot through that hole if you're space back.

4627
03:56:34,870 --> 03:56:36,469
Like, you can shoot them if you step back.

4628
03:56:36,469 --> 03:56:38,709
Beautiful.

4629
03:56:38,709 --> 03:56:39,350
Oh, you can.

4630
03:56:39,350 --> 03:56:40,309
Excellent technique.

4631
03:56:40,309 --> 03:56:41,129
Yep.

4632
03:56:41,129 --> 03:56:42,489
Yeah, I mean, you can also use...

4633
03:56:42,489 --> 03:56:44,010
It's not high enough to shoot.

4634
03:56:44,010 --> 03:56:46,840
Here, let me turn this off for you.

4635
03:56:46,840 --> 03:56:48,569
Oh, so much better.

4636
03:56:48,569 --> 03:56:49,690
I was worried.

4637
03:56:49,690 --> 03:56:53,579
All right, boys, just run with me, please.

4638
03:56:53,579 --> 03:56:57,559
This way.

4639
03:56:57,559 --> 03:56:59,739
Doesn't mean shoot.

4640
03:56:59,739 --> 03:57:00,540
Ow!

4641
03:57:00,540 --> 03:57:02,299
He's aggroing enemies on purpose.

4642
03:57:02,299 --> 03:57:03,500
He's griefing us.

4643
03:57:03,500 --> 03:57:04,700
Does it matter if I shoot him?

4644
03:57:04,700 --> 03:57:05,819
No, I'm kidding.

4645
03:57:05,819 --> 03:57:06,620
I'm kidding.

4646
03:57:06,620 --> 03:57:08,569
It was all in jest, my friend.

4647
03:57:08,569 --> 03:57:10,579
I didn't like that joke.

4648
03:57:10,579 --> 03:57:14,420
That joke was hurtful.

4649
03:57:14,420 --> 03:57:15,139
Good.

4650
03:57:15,139 --> 03:57:16,809
It means it was funny.

4651
03:57:16,809 --> 03:57:22,120
This is supposed to be a gamer run, not an argument run.

4652
03:57:22,120 --> 03:57:23,399
We've had plenty of those.

4653
03:57:23,399 --> 03:57:24,280
Please, guys.

4654
03:57:25,479 --> 03:57:26,920
Now, I'm going to eat my snack.

4655
03:57:29,020 --> 03:57:32,950
Oh, this guy was shot with arrows.

4656
03:57:32,950 --> 03:57:33,829
Boys, look at this.

4657
03:57:33,829 --> 03:57:34,549
Look at this.

4658
03:57:34,549 --> 03:57:37,510
We're going to do our Witcher 3 Geralt of Orivia inspection.

4659
03:57:38,729 --> 03:57:40,090
Arrows to the body.

4660
03:57:40,090 --> 03:57:41,299
Somebody shot him.

4661
03:57:41,299 --> 03:57:42,180
That's all I got for you.

4662
03:57:42,180 --> 03:57:43,139
Those were my arrows.

4663
03:57:44,040 --> 03:57:45,239
Geralt, those were my arrows.

4664
03:57:45,239 --> 03:57:45,799
I was trying.

4665
03:57:45,799 --> 03:57:48,280
I thought he was on the ground pretending to be dead.

4666
03:57:48,280 --> 03:57:49,670
So I was doing it.

4667
03:57:50,549 --> 03:57:51,670
I'm a little upset.

4668
03:57:51,670 --> 03:57:53,319
My Witcher senses have failed me.

4669
03:57:59,159 --> 03:57:59,639
Don't move.

4670
03:57:59,639 --> 03:58:00,680
Don't you move a shoe.

4671
03:58:00,680 --> 03:58:01,979
Don't move.

4672
03:58:01,979 --> 03:58:02,620
Listening.

4673
03:58:02,620 --> 03:58:04,040
All right, we're good.

4674
03:58:04,040 --> 03:58:04,360
Follow me.

4675
03:58:04,360 --> 03:58:04,840
Spiders.

4676
03:58:04,840 --> 03:58:06,040
There's a lever right here.

4677
03:58:06,040 --> 03:58:10,979
Let's get in this room.

4678
03:58:10,979 --> 03:58:12,979
Oh, that's where those spiders are.

4679
03:58:15,860 --> 03:58:16,260
I'm coming.

4680
03:58:16,260 --> 03:58:16,819
I'm coming.

4681
03:58:16,819 --> 03:58:18,280
All right, we got to go.

4682
03:58:18,280 --> 03:58:19,719
We got to get circling south.

4683
03:58:19,719 --> 03:58:21,540
Speed.

4684
03:58:21,540 --> 03:58:22,500
Oh, my goodness.

4685
03:58:23,700 --> 03:58:25,219
I don't know what this means, but this is cool looking.

4686
03:58:27,000 --> 03:58:27,319
Stir.

4687
03:58:27,319 --> 03:58:28,840
If only we had a lockpick.

4688
03:58:28,840 --> 03:58:30,180
Oh, fuck.

4689
03:58:30,180 --> 03:58:32,760
I'm going to start being a lockpick guy.

4690
03:58:32,760 --> 03:58:33,479
Oh, my God.

4691
03:58:34,979 --> 03:58:35,940
I've never seen one of these.

4692
03:58:37,620 --> 03:58:40,020
We're about to get cuddled by the circle if we don't get out of here.

4693
03:58:40,020 --> 03:58:40,340
Shit.

4694
03:58:40,340 --> 03:58:41,780
Let's go.

4695
03:58:41,780 --> 03:58:42,579
Let's go, dude.

4696
03:58:43,379 --> 03:58:44,260
I wonder what's in there.

4697
03:58:44,260 --> 03:58:44,899
I'm out.

4698
03:58:44,899 --> 03:58:45,219
Bye-bye.

4699
03:58:48,709 --> 03:58:49,510
Bye-bye.

4700
03:58:49,510 --> 03:58:53,690
It's probably all kinds of jewels and gems.

4701
03:59:01,719 --> 03:59:02,920
I want to be just a green.

4702
03:59:02,920 --> 03:59:03,719
Yeah, that's possible.

4703
03:59:03,719 --> 03:59:04,680
Friends.

4704
03:59:04,680 --> 03:59:06,040
Hello, friends.

4705
03:59:06,040 --> 03:59:06,620
Hello.

4706
03:59:06,620 --> 03:59:07,739
This is a gamer run.

4707
03:59:07,739 --> 03:59:08,700
This is a gamer run.

4708
03:59:08,700 --> 03:59:09,260
We play.

4709
03:59:09,260 --> 03:59:09,739
I know.

4710
03:59:09,739 --> 03:59:10,620
I was going to.

4711
03:59:10,620 --> 03:59:11,420
It was metagaming.

4712
03:59:11,420 --> 03:59:11,979
OK.

4713
03:59:11,979 --> 03:59:13,459
Hold on.

4714
03:59:13,459 --> 03:59:14,819
I'm in the secret passage.

4715
03:59:14,819 --> 03:59:16,100
I was going for a deception check.

4716
03:59:24,569 --> 03:59:25,770
This old castle.

4717
03:59:25,770 --> 03:59:27,129
Just want to make sure everyone's aware.

4718
03:59:27,129 --> 03:59:29,750
I just killed them both.

4719
03:59:29,750 --> 03:59:30,469
You monster.

4720
03:59:30,469 --> 03:59:30,870
I love it.

4721
03:59:31,750 --> 03:59:32,870
Look what you become.

4722
03:59:32,870 --> 03:59:34,889
I'll take credit for that.

4723
03:59:34,889 --> 03:59:35,530
Thank you.

4724
03:59:35,530 --> 03:59:35,930
My goodness.

4725
03:59:35,930 --> 03:59:36,409
They love us.

4726
03:59:39,700 --> 03:59:40,819
Ooh, is that better?

4727
03:59:40,819 --> 03:59:41,559
28.

4728
03:59:41,559 --> 03:59:42,040
Yeah.

4729
03:59:42,040 --> 03:59:44,340
I'm in space.

4730
03:59:44,899 --> 03:59:47,620
Oh, here.

4731
03:59:47,620 --> 03:59:48,819
Take this trap if you want.

4732
03:59:48,819 --> 03:59:49,620
Because you're a ranger now.

4733
03:59:49,620 --> 03:59:54,629
You can use those.

4734
03:59:54,629 --> 03:59:55,190
Oh, my God.

4735
03:59:55,190 --> 03:59:57,030
Throwing axes are so good.

4736
03:59:57,030 --> 04:00:00,409
Do you mind if I take this potion, my friend?

4737
04:00:02,569 --> 04:00:03,770
No, please do it.

4738
04:00:03,770 --> 04:00:04,809
Oh, thank you.

4739
04:00:04,809 --> 04:00:05,930
So so coined.

4740
04:00:05,930 --> 04:00:07,959
Do you want these throwing axes?

4741
04:00:07,959 --> 04:00:09,959
Oh, dude, I yes.

4742
04:00:09,959 --> 04:00:12,540
Because I have like a shitload of them.

4743
04:00:12,540 --> 04:00:14,219
I love these things.

4744
04:00:14,219 --> 04:00:15,659
I also love the oil lanterns.

4745
04:00:15,659 --> 04:00:16,549
Thank you.

4746
04:00:16,549 --> 04:00:19,420
Oh, God bless.

4747
04:00:19,420 --> 04:00:20,700
They're 30 damage a pop.

4748
04:00:20,700 --> 04:00:23,860
But they're just actually not an exit.

4749
04:00:23,940 --> 04:00:24,659
There is an exit.

4750
04:00:31,000 --> 04:00:32,760
Boys, I have a feeling there's...

4751
04:00:33,479 --> 04:00:34,520
Wait, hold on.

4752
04:00:34,520 --> 04:00:35,799
Let me just kill feed.

4753
04:00:35,799 --> 04:00:37,319
Oh, there's friends ahead, friends ahead.

4754
04:00:37,319 --> 04:00:37,719
All right.

4755
04:00:37,719 --> 04:00:39,420
This is a gamer run, remember?

4756
04:00:39,420 --> 04:00:48,379
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4757
04:00:48,379 --> 04:00:49,100
Stop.

4758
04:00:49,100 --> 04:00:50,540
In the name of the law.

4759
04:00:50,540 --> 04:00:55,290
This is a gamer run.

4760
04:00:55,290 --> 04:00:58,520
I'm just going to leave.

4761
04:01:00,979 --> 04:01:02,500
They ran.

4762
04:01:02,500 --> 04:01:02,979
Oh, yeah.

4763
04:01:02,979 --> 04:01:04,569
Oh, yeah.

4764
04:01:04,569 --> 04:01:05,850
They're certified runners.

4765
04:01:05,850 --> 04:01:06,329
Oh, my God.

4766
04:01:06,329 --> 04:01:06,969
They're so dead.

4767
04:01:06,969 --> 04:01:08,090
They're so dead.

4768
04:01:08,090 --> 04:01:08,409
Stop.

4769
04:01:08,409 --> 04:01:09,530
This is a gamer run.

4770
04:01:09,530 --> 04:01:10,409
They're like, OK.

4771
04:01:12,229 --> 04:01:17,180
And what does that mean?

4772
04:01:17,180 --> 04:01:18,139
Watch me throwing axe skills.

4773
04:01:18,139 --> 04:01:18,540
Watch this.

4774
04:01:19,340 --> 04:01:20,600
Is this gas?

4775
04:01:22,899 --> 04:01:23,379
Hail Mary.

4776
04:01:23,379 --> 04:01:23,860
Hail Mary.

4777
04:01:24,420 --> 04:01:25,219
Oh, so close.

4778
04:01:31,159 --> 04:01:32,360
There's a lot of shit in there.

4779
04:01:32,360 --> 04:01:33,319
I don't know if we fight in here.

4780
04:01:34,950 --> 04:01:35,430
It's fine.

4781
04:01:35,430 --> 04:01:36,069
You'll be all right.

4782
04:01:36,069 --> 04:01:37,270
There's a lot of people in here.

4783
04:01:37,909 --> 04:01:39,370
What the heck?

4784
04:01:39,370 --> 04:01:41,370
Ster, where are you?

4785
04:01:41,370 --> 04:01:42,819
Wait, you left.

4786
04:01:42,819 --> 04:01:44,280
Oh, Sterg left.

4787
04:01:44,280 --> 04:01:45,159
I went home.

4788
04:01:45,159 --> 04:01:45,799
Oh, shit.

4789
04:01:45,799 --> 04:01:46,680
I mean, he was gaming.

4790
04:01:46,680 --> 04:01:47,239
He was gaming.

4791
04:01:47,239 --> 04:01:47,799
Yeah, you were.

4792
04:01:49,639 --> 04:01:51,000
You guys ran off.

4793
04:01:51,000 --> 04:01:53,319
I was looting like a secret room.

4794
04:01:53,319 --> 04:01:54,840
And then you guys just kept going.

4795
04:01:54,840 --> 04:01:55,799
I'm out of here.

4796
04:01:55,799 --> 04:01:56,280
I'm sorry.

4797
04:01:56,280 --> 04:01:57,079
You're on your own.

4798
04:01:57,079 --> 04:01:57,799
No, you're good.

4799
04:01:57,799 --> 04:02:00,620
I'm medicated.

4800
04:02:00,620 --> 04:02:09,370
Oh, he put the worms on you.

4801
04:02:09,370 --> 04:02:10,090
Yeah, I'm out of here.

4802
04:02:10,090 --> 04:02:23,219
I have a lot of stuff.

4803
04:02:23,219 --> 04:02:24,659
Oh, yes.

4804
04:02:24,659 --> 04:02:25,299
OK, goodbye.

4805
04:02:29,260 --> 04:02:30,459
Oh, bastard.

4806
04:02:32,280 --> 04:02:33,959
You're in a predicament down here.

4807
04:02:35,459 --> 04:02:35,940
Was that?

4808
04:02:38,469 --> 04:02:41,829
Yeah, there was so many things in that room.

4809
04:02:41,829 --> 04:02:43,750
I kind of abandoned you, but I'm sorry.

4810
04:02:43,750 --> 04:02:44,389
But I did.

4811
04:02:44,389 --> 04:02:45,030
You're fine.

4812
04:02:45,030 --> 04:02:47,350
Gamers gamers don't have feelings.

4813
04:02:48,549 --> 04:02:49,270
I'm actually offended.

4814
04:02:49,270 --> 04:02:50,469
You're apologizing right now.

4815
04:02:50,920 --> 04:02:55,319
Well, in that case, um, you.

4816
04:02:56,440 --> 04:02:56,840
Yeah.

4817
04:02:56,840 --> 04:02:57,319
Well, thank you.

4818
04:02:57,319 --> 04:02:58,280
Now I feel better.

4819
04:02:58,280 --> 04:03:01,030
I think you are.

4820
04:03:01,030 --> 04:03:02,469
Are you going for a battle here?

4821
04:03:02,469 --> 04:03:04,389
Because you got a lot of potential.

4822
04:03:04,389 --> 04:03:05,350
I think there's somebody in that room.

4823
04:03:06,069 --> 04:03:08,520
Well, they have to come to me.

4824
04:03:09,079 --> 04:03:10,520
That's the beautiful thing about this run.

4825
04:03:17,979 --> 04:03:19,979
I was drinking out of drinking of water

4826
04:03:20,940 --> 04:03:23,180
and I just like scared the shit out of me.

4827
04:03:25,780 --> 04:03:26,979
Trevor, there's someone in your room.

4828
04:03:28,100 --> 04:03:28,579
Get out.

4829
04:03:33,190 --> 04:03:34,549
If they're dumb, they're going to come through.

4830
04:03:34,549 --> 04:03:35,350
I really hope they do.

4831
04:03:36,069 --> 04:03:37,510
Well, what if they just run right in?

4832
04:03:38,149 --> 04:03:39,530
Well, if they go around, at least

4833
04:03:39,530 --> 04:03:40,969
and then I get the swing on them first.

4834
04:03:41,770 --> 04:03:45,530
This is what gaming looks like, boys.

4835
04:03:46,250 --> 04:03:47,899
Ah, too bad.

4836
04:03:49,420 --> 04:03:53,159
I was kind of hoping somebody was just going to run in.

4837
04:03:54,840 --> 04:03:57,579
Okay, cool.

4838
04:03:57,579 --> 04:03:59,020
That should be a lot of money.

4839
04:03:59,020 --> 04:04:05,500
Do you instantly sell or you just put it in your stash?

4840
04:04:06,139 --> 04:04:07,739
Uh, I sell pretty much everything

4841
04:04:07,739 --> 04:04:09,100
unless it's something that's valuable.

4842
04:04:09,659 --> 04:04:11,209
Yeah, I'm afraid to.

4843
04:04:11,209 --> 04:04:13,209
I might get yelled at, so I'm already ready.

4844
04:04:13,209 --> 04:04:16,200
Uh, yeah, I'm going to start yelling in a second.

4845
04:04:16,200 --> 04:04:20,809
Just take the second.

4846
04:04:20,809 --> 04:04:22,860
Hold on.

4847
04:04:22,860 --> 04:04:23,659
Oh my God, this guy.

4848
04:04:24,299 --> 04:04:25,100
It just takes a second.

4849
04:04:25,819 --> 04:04:26,860
Mm hmm. Sure it does.

4850
04:04:27,420 --> 04:04:35,340
Look at that.

4851
04:04:35,340 --> 04:04:36,059
I'm going to fill the whole thing up.

4852
04:04:36,059 --> 04:04:37,659
I got an oil lamp.

4853
04:04:37,659 --> 04:04:39,479
Is that irrelevant?

4854
04:04:39,479 --> 04:04:41,319
So it's basically just a molly.

4855
04:04:41,319 --> 04:04:43,239
You right click and you throw it like a molly.

4856
04:04:43,239 --> 04:04:45,239
Oh, I assumed it was like a.

4857
04:04:45,239 --> 04:04:46,870
It actually is a light source.

4858
04:04:46,870 --> 04:04:49,670
So if you if you left click, it's a light source.

4859
04:04:49,670 --> 04:04:50,549
Do you know what I want to do?

4860
04:04:51,750 --> 04:04:52,870
I'm going to be such a.

4861
04:04:52,870 --> 04:04:54,549
I'm going to be such a fucking weirdo.

4862
04:04:54,549 --> 04:04:56,889
But like the last day of the beta,

4863
04:04:56,889 --> 04:05:01,559
I'm going to fill my entire inventory with 10 gold stacks

4864
04:05:01,639 --> 04:05:04,680
and just and just be a loot goblin and just die for somebody.

4865
04:05:04,680 --> 04:05:07,799
And they'll they're going to look at me and take my gear and go.

4866
04:05:10,540 --> 04:05:11,100
You know what I mean?

4867
04:05:11,100 --> 04:05:13,020
Really fill every single slot.

4868
04:05:13,020 --> 04:05:14,700
What are you, Mr. Beast?

4869
04:05:14,700 --> 04:05:15,180
Like what?

4870
04:05:19,209 --> 04:05:19,690
Like what?

4871
04:05:19,690 --> 04:05:21,610
Like to make somebody's day for no reason?

4872
04:05:21,610 --> 04:05:22,569
Yeah, like, I don't know.

4873
04:05:23,129 --> 04:05:24,250
Because if that happened.

4874
04:05:24,250 --> 04:05:25,129
I hate that.

4875
04:05:25,129 --> 04:05:25,930
Why?

4876
04:05:25,930 --> 04:05:28,180
I'd rather have worms.

4877
04:05:28,180 --> 04:05:30,340
Why it's OK.

4878
04:05:30,340 --> 04:05:32,260
If I were to if you killed.

4879
04:05:32,260 --> 04:05:32,500
All right.

4880
04:05:32,500 --> 04:05:34,819
If you killed somebody with an axe in this game.

4881
04:05:35,139 --> 04:05:38,739
And you looted them and their whole inventory was a stack of gold.

4882
04:05:38,739 --> 04:05:42,329
You don't think you would chuckle and be like, what the fuck are you doing, man?

4883
04:05:42,329 --> 04:05:44,809
I thought you were going to like run around and like leave a trail.

4884
04:05:46,680 --> 04:05:47,959
That'd be even better.

4885
04:05:47,959 --> 04:05:54,280
Yeah, like when I get hit, like drop five and keep running.

4886
04:05:54,280 --> 04:05:58,760
Yeah, just fill my inventory with potions and like surgical kits

4887
04:05:58,760 --> 04:06:02,579
and just run around and every time I get hit, just drop five stacks and just keep going.

4888
04:06:02,579 --> 04:06:04,260
I mean, you play Borderlands, right?

4889
04:06:04,260 --> 04:06:05,500
A little bit, yeah.

4890
04:06:05,500 --> 04:06:08,059
Like there's the loot goblins that like you shoot and they just drop.

4891
04:06:09,700 --> 04:06:11,860
They just drop gear as you shoot that pretty much.

4892
04:06:11,860 --> 04:06:12,260
Sonic.

4893
04:06:12,260 --> 04:06:12,819
Same concept.

4894
04:06:19,909 --> 04:06:20,709
What in the world?

4895
04:06:20,709 --> 04:06:23,190
It was actually pretty good singing.

4896
04:06:23,190 --> 04:06:23,829
That's pretty good.

4897
04:06:27,770 --> 04:06:28,889
All right, guys, stick together.

4898
04:06:28,889 --> 04:06:30,010
Keep your wits about you.

4899
04:06:30,010 --> 04:06:33,540
We all might make it out alive.

4900
04:06:33,540 --> 04:06:34,579
I mean, we split up.

4901
04:06:34,579 --> 04:06:39,219
We still made it because we're committing to being video game players now.

4902
04:06:39,219 --> 04:06:45,340
You guys walk through like four rooms of unopened chests that was just opening boxes.

4903
04:06:45,340 --> 04:06:48,059
And then I turned to look where you were and you were like the other side of the map.

4904
04:06:48,059 --> 04:06:48,940
I was like, OK, bye.

4905
04:06:49,739 --> 04:06:52,700
Well, I prioritize getting kills, getting frags.

4906
04:06:52,700 --> 04:06:54,139
You know, I don't need that.

4907
04:06:54,139 --> 04:06:55,979
You know, getting money is for plebs at this point.

4908
04:06:55,979 --> 04:06:57,100
I'm I'm already rich.

4909
04:06:57,100 --> 04:07:01,340
Well, unless you want to do your money loot goblin video that I'm doing.

4910
04:07:01,979 --> 04:07:03,079
True.

4911
04:07:03,079 --> 04:07:03,639
That's that's it.

4912
04:07:03,639 --> 04:07:04,280
Did you get hit by that?

4913
04:07:07,059 --> 04:07:10,340
Oh, boys, I got I got boys on me looking for a fight already.

4914
04:07:11,700 --> 04:07:12,100
Yeah.

4915
04:07:12,100 --> 04:07:16,020
I mean, in theory, we want to let them live a little longer so we can loot them later.

4916
04:07:16,020 --> 04:07:16,260
Yeah.

4917
04:07:16,340 --> 04:07:18,540
But I like killing them now.

4918
04:07:18,540 --> 04:07:24,340
Kind of kind of a wild one.

4919
04:07:24,340 --> 04:07:25,459
Oh, he made the jump.

4920
04:07:25,459 --> 04:07:26,260
He's kind of nuts.

4921
04:07:26,899 --> 04:07:27,860
That's crazy.

4922
04:07:27,860 --> 04:07:28,579
Don't mess with that guy.

4923
04:07:28,579 --> 04:07:29,059
He's good.

4924
04:07:32,469 --> 04:07:33,270
What the fuck?

4925
04:07:33,270 --> 04:07:35,430
Oh, I killed one.

4926
04:07:35,430 --> 04:07:35,750
Yeah.

4927
04:07:35,750 --> 04:07:36,309
Beautiful.

4928
04:07:36,309 --> 04:07:37,350
Well done, sir.

4929
04:07:37,350 --> 04:07:37,909
Yeah, same.

4930
04:07:39,829 --> 04:07:40,629
Where are you, sir?

4931
04:07:40,629 --> 04:07:41,510
I don't.

4932
04:07:41,510 --> 04:07:42,549
Where did you guys go?

4933
04:07:42,549 --> 04:07:44,329
You're dead.

4934
04:07:44,329 --> 04:07:48,329
I was in the starting room killing the enemies that were around and picking things up.

4935
04:07:48,329 --> 04:07:51,819
Should I stop picking things up and playing the core loop of the game?

4936
04:07:51,819 --> 04:07:52,700
Are we done with that?

4937
04:07:52,700 --> 04:07:54,860
No, he just saw he had bloodlust.

4938
04:07:54,860 --> 04:07:57,049
He just ran after a bunch of people.

4939
04:07:57,049 --> 04:07:57,770
OK, I don't know.

4940
04:07:57,770 --> 04:07:58,649
A guy landed on me.

4941
04:07:58,649 --> 04:07:59,290
I'm dead.

4942
04:07:59,290 --> 04:08:04,600
The guy made no footsteps and just appeared on me and then I died.

4943
04:08:04,600 --> 04:08:12,440
So I got to fuck this guy up real quick.

4944
04:08:12,440 --> 04:08:13,239
Please hold.

4945
04:08:13,239 --> 04:08:14,280
Oh, wait, you're alive.

4946
04:08:14,280 --> 04:08:15,000
I thought they killed you.

4947
04:08:15,000 --> 04:08:15,639
Oh, yeah.

4948
04:08:15,639 --> 04:08:16,440
No, no, I'm not.

4949
04:08:16,440 --> 04:08:18,200
I'm realizing who I'm watching right now.

4950
04:08:18,200 --> 04:08:20,329
So you just left me to die.

4951
04:08:26,340 --> 04:08:27,379
OK, these traps suck.

4952
04:08:27,379 --> 04:08:27,860
Holy shit.

4953
04:08:33,879 --> 04:08:34,120
All right.

4954
04:08:34,120 --> 04:08:35,639
I just OK, that was weird.

4955
04:08:35,639 --> 04:08:42,149
Gamer versus gamer.

4956
04:08:42,149 --> 04:08:46,709
If you smarty won't go through.

4957
04:08:56,709 --> 04:08:57,829
I almost got his head.

4958
04:08:58,469 --> 04:09:00,340
That's close.

4959
04:09:00,340 --> 04:09:03,379
But anyways, you know, I usually go for player kills immediately

4960
04:09:03,379 --> 04:09:05,860
because you obviously, if you kill them, you get the best loot

4961
04:09:05,860 --> 04:09:07,299
because they come in kidded most of the times.

4962
04:09:07,860 --> 04:09:10,739
So if you can just get a good kill on them as a barb, you get the loot,

4963
04:09:10,739 --> 04:09:12,250
which means we all got loot.

4964
04:09:12,250 --> 04:09:13,610
Does that make sense?

4965
04:09:13,610 --> 04:09:14,790
Yeah.

4966
04:09:14,790 --> 04:09:16,469
Well, you also level up.

4967
04:09:16,469 --> 04:09:17,989
You level quick too, right?

4968
04:09:17,989 --> 04:09:20,469
If you kill a player, it's not worth a lot.

4969
04:09:20,469 --> 04:09:27,590
Yeah, 100%.

4970
04:09:27,590 --> 04:09:33,659
We have like our three actual classes that we have been accidentally RPing as the whole time.

4971
04:09:33,659 --> 04:09:36,940
You're like the bloodlust barbarian and that's what you're doing.

4972
04:09:37,420 --> 04:09:41,659
Stir is like the tinkerer that wants to collect the loot and the toys.

4973
04:09:41,659 --> 04:09:43,260
I thought you were playing the game.

4974
04:09:43,260 --> 04:09:46,540
And I'm like the I'm like the fucking stand up comedian

4975
04:09:46,540 --> 04:09:50,229
that just walks around and yells at people and dies.

4976
04:09:50,229 --> 04:09:51,590
Yeah, I mean, make no mistake about it.

4977
04:09:51,590 --> 04:09:52,709
I'm actually a troglodyte.

4978
04:09:52,709 --> 04:09:55,430
Stir wants to live more than two minutes.

4979
04:09:55,430 --> 04:09:58,469
The bard, the jester, you're the loot goblin.

4980
04:10:01,510 --> 04:10:03,190
What class is the stand?

4981
04:10:03,190 --> 04:10:05,590
Oh, yeah, you're the you're the you're the barbarian.

4982
04:10:05,590 --> 04:10:09,620
You are the tinkerer thief and I'm the stand up comedian.

4983
04:10:09,620 --> 04:10:11,299
They need to add instruments to this game.

4984
04:10:11,379 --> 04:10:15,540
I think they're I think the conversation was adding bards and either

4985
04:10:16,260 --> 04:10:18,579
warlocks or necromancers to the game.

4986
04:10:18,579 --> 04:10:22,360
Did they actually have plans on adding more classes?

4987
04:10:22,360 --> 04:10:24,520
Yeah, no, I mean, they have they have completely

4988
04:10:25,930 --> 04:10:29,770
been transparent on this is Dungeons and Dragons multiplayer.

4989
04:10:29,770 --> 04:10:31,579
Really?

4990
04:10:31,579 --> 04:10:36,040
Which is going to be interesting with the new Wizards of the Coast decisions.

4991
04:10:37,799 --> 04:10:40,360
Well, I look any content is cool.

4992
04:10:40,360 --> 04:10:43,319
I mean, I think the game is pretty close to this right now.

4993
04:10:43,319 --> 04:10:45,340
Yeah, 100%.

4994
04:10:49,049 --> 04:10:51,370
Yeah, the game is just the demo is free.

4995
04:10:51,370 --> 04:10:52,809
Some people have been asking about it.

4996
04:10:52,809 --> 04:10:57,559
You can just play it right now during the Steam demo week, whatever.

4997
04:10:57,559 --> 04:11:00,920
Yeah, I had a wild thought and maybe I'm getting ahead of myself, but hear me out.

4998
04:11:00,920 --> 04:11:04,120
Imagine this game with a forge system like Halo Forge,

4999
04:11:04,120 --> 04:11:09,739
where they make the dungeons and you have to traverse player made dungeons.

5000
04:11:09,739 --> 04:11:11,350
Interesting.

5001
04:11:11,350 --> 04:11:13,719
Like a Mario maker thing.

5002
04:11:13,719 --> 04:11:15,879
It's like just these nuts dungeons.

5003
04:11:15,879 --> 04:11:17,479
I'd love more PvE.

5004
04:11:17,479 --> 04:11:19,719
PvE I think in this game could be really, really awesome.

5005
04:11:21,049 --> 04:11:22,569
Yeah, any more PvE would be great.

5006
04:11:24,680 --> 04:11:27,559
Because it doesn't spoon feed you in terms of combat.

5007
04:11:27,559 --> 04:11:30,649
It's more like it's more like a fuck you.

5008
04:11:30,649 --> 04:11:32,299
Good luck.

5009
04:11:32,299 --> 04:11:33,899
Yeah, let's see what they do.

5010
04:11:33,899 --> 04:11:39,100
I mean, it's been pretty fun so far, so.

5011
04:11:39,100 --> 04:11:40,420
Yes.

5012
04:11:40,420 --> 04:11:41,770
All right, Fearing.

5013
04:11:41,770 --> 04:11:45,690
I think the Elder Scrolls does that, the PvE part.

5014
04:11:53,590 --> 04:11:55,989
There are so fucking many of these things.

5015
04:11:56,549 --> 04:11:59,190
Yeah, make sure you loot every single one of these when you kill them.

5016
04:11:59,190 --> 04:12:00,069
Nice job, by the way.

5017
04:12:00,069 --> 04:12:01,579
This guy's a game.

5018
04:12:01,579 --> 04:12:04,860
Fuck.

5019
04:12:04,860 --> 04:12:05,360
Game.

5020
04:12:07,219 --> 04:12:08,420
Oh, lockpick here.

5021
04:12:08,420 --> 04:12:09,940
Here, you have the highest resource for this.

5022
04:12:09,940 --> 04:12:11,540
I think your lockpick chances are better.

5023
04:12:11,540 --> 04:12:16,100
Oh, wait, don't don't drop any items on the pyramid that can get stuck in the textures,

5024
04:12:16,100 --> 04:12:17,899
the elevated textures.

5025
04:12:18,620 --> 04:12:20,100
Yeah.

5026
04:12:20,100 --> 04:12:23,700
Yeah, like how that like how that short bow we couldn't remember.

5027
04:12:23,700 --> 04:12:26,180
Anyways, look at this little flashlight.

5028
04:12:26,180 --> 04:12:26,979
Oh, this one was red.

5029
04:12:28,420 --> 04:12:33,540
Yep, the red ones are like the they're the elite version of the death skulls.

5030
04:12:35,290 --> 04:12:36,569
But here, take I'm going to drop.

5031
04:12:36,569 --> 04:12:39,690
I'm going to put this on the body of something and you can use that to on the

5032
04:12:40,409 --> 04:12:41,530
the chest up here.

5033
04:12:43,670 --> 04:12:44,950
Mr. Ranger man.

5034
04:12:44,950 --> 04:12:48,260
I'll put it in here.

5035
04:12:48,340 --> 04:12:48,659
Oh, wait.

5036
04:12:48,659 --> 04:12:49,299
Well, I'm sorry.

5037
04:12:49,299 --> 04:12:51,540
I'm so locked in chest.

5038
04:12:53,299 --> 04:12:54,180
You smarter than me.

5039
04:12:55,940 --> 04:12:57,059
I take lockpick.

5040
04:12:57,059 --> 04:12:58,659
I go take lockpick lock.

5041
04:12:58,659 --> 04:13:01,579
You use, you know, minigame of lockpick.

5042
04:13:01,579 --> 04:13:03,100
It's very quick, by the way.

5043
04:13:03,100 --> 04:13:04,059
It's not like slow.

5044
04:13:04,700 --> 04:13:08,090
OK, well, if your character's dumb, it's harder.

5045
04:13:08,090 --> 04:13:13,030
I that was like a jump scare and I was supposed to click.

5046
04:13:13,030 --> 04:13:16,469
It's very I couldn't even warn you because me saying it was fast.

5047
04:13:16,469 --> 04:13:17,590
It's like, OK, how fast?

5048
04:13:17,590 --> 04:13:19,270
And it's it's unbelievably fast.

5049
04:13:19,270 --> 04:13:20,569
So yeah.

5050
04:13:20,569 --> 04:13:24,090
I mean, you like the human benchmark test fast.

5051
04:13:24,090 --> 04:13:25,979
And what button does it?

5052
04:13:25,979 --> 04:13:27,340
It's left click.

5053
04:13:27,340 --> 04:13:28,540
It's really annoying.

5054
04:13:28,540 --> 04:13:29,340
OK, I thought so.

5055
04:13:29,340 --> 04:13:31,420
My chat was telling me random buttons.

5056
04:13:31,979 --> 04:13:32,620
Well, good.

5057
04:13:32,620 --> 04:13:35,100
I mean, well, you do have weird vines potentially.

5058
04:13:35,100 --> 04:13:39,159
Your left click is probably like a foot pedal.

5059
04:13:39,159 --> 04:13:40,280
Yeah, it is.

5060
04:13:40,280 --> 04:13:43,510
I don't know how you knew that.

5061
04:13:43,510 --> 04:13:43,989
That's weird.

5062
04:13:45,450 --> 04:13:46,250
All right.

5063
04:13:46,250 --> 04:13:48,569
Yeah, the lockpicking is actually very hard.

5064
04:13:48,569 --> 04:13:49,930
It's not simple.

5065
04:13:49,930 --> 04:13:54,889
Yeah, I thought it was going to be a whole menu, not like a jump scare.

5066
04:13:54,889 --> 04:13:56,149
It's over.

5067
04:13:56,229 --> 04:13:59,430
Well, I was envisioned like Splinter Cell Chaos Theory lockpicking

5068
04:13:59,430 --> 04:14:01,909
and I was very wrong when I got to do it the first time.

5069
04:14:18,040 --> 04:14:18,760
Well done, boys.

5070
04:14:18,760 --> 04:14:19,159
Well done.

5071
04:14:19,159 --> 04:14:21,459
I'll hit them for good measure.

5072
04:14:21,459 --> 04:14:22,500
Teamwork, baby.

5073
04:14:22,500 --> 04:14:22,899
We did it.

5074
04:14:22,899 --> 04:14:23,940
That's what it's all about.

5075
04:14:23,940 --> 04:14:25,620
I saw your you took your pants off.

5076
04:14:25,620 --> 04:14:26,180
I saw you.

5077
04:14:29,110 --> 04:14:33,139
You didn't see anything.

5078
04:14:33,139 --> 04:14:33,540
Stop.

5079
04:14:33,540 --> 04:14:33,940
Stop.

5080
04:14:33,940 --> 04:14:34,420
Stop.

5081
04:14:34,420 --> 04:14:35,620
Oh, there's a lockpick.

5082
04:14:35,620 --> 04:14:37,059
Do you want someone to try it again?

5083
04:14:38,940 --> 04:14:40,299
Are you decent at this dirty?

5084
04:14:40,299 --> 04:14:40,860
Want to try it again?

5085
04:14:42,809 --> 04:14:43,690
I would like to try.

5086
04:14:43,690 --> 04:14:44,649
I don't have any more lockpicks.

5087
04:14:44,649 --> 04:14:45,290
There's one right here.

5088
04:14:45,290 --> 04:14:48,010
I'm going to I'm going to fully acknowledge that I'm trash at them.

5089
04:14:48,250 --> 04:14:50,010
And again, my my character is actually dumb.

5090
04:14:50,010 --> 04:14:50,969
Also, I have a rapier for you.

5091
04:14:50,969 --> 04:14:52,649
If you need my friend, stir, come on.

5092
04:14:52,649 --> 04:14:54,389
Oh, I can.

5093
04:14:54,389 --> 04:14:56,069
I'll just give you it on the ground.

5094
04:14:56,069 --> 04:14:56,629
Can I hold on?

5095
04:14:56,629 --> 04:14:59,430
I'm putting I'm putting 40 arrows in this guy's head real quick.

5096
04:15:00,229 --> 04:15:01,909
And some of them are going through.

5097
04:15:01,909 --> 04:15:02,709
They're all come out.

5098
04:15:02,709 --> 04:15:03,270
Oh, geez.

5099
04:15:03,270 --> 04:15:03,829
Oh, my.

5100
04:15:03,829 --> 04:15:04,549
Oh, my Lord.

5101
04:15:05,270 --> 04:15:05,989
Oh, my God.

5102
04:15:07,850 --> 04:15:08,090
All right.

5103
04:15:08,090 --> 04:15:08,889
No guy.

5104
04:15:08,889 --> 04:15:12,010
For one second, I thought there was somebody in the discord call.

5105
04:15:12,010 --> 04:15:13,930
I was like somebody like in somebody's background coughing.

5106
04:15:14,489 --> 04:15:15,049
All right.

5107
04:15:15,049 --> 04:15:16,500
Stir lockpick.

5108
04:15:16,500 --> 04:15:17,780
Let's try it.

5109
04:15:17,780 --> 04:15:19,540
And then sort of a melee if you need it.

5110
04:15:19,780 --> 04:15:20,280
Okay.

5111
04:15:21,379 --> 04:15:30,219
No, I'll take that sword fire.

5112
04:15:30,219 --> 04:15:30,700
There's it.

5113
04:15:31,879 --> 04:15:32,440
Does it really?

5114
04:15:34,229 --> 04:15:34,549
No.

5115
04:15:34,549 --> 04:15:35,270
Yeah.

5116
04:15:35,270 --> 04:15:35,770
Yeah.

5117
04:15:36,790 --> 04:15:42,549
I was I was like, I've been I've been like wondering if there's like a way to clear that forever now.

5118
04:15:42,549 --> 04:15:43,350
I don't think so.

5119
04:15:47,290 --> 04:15:47,610
Okay.

5120
04:15:47,610 --> 04:15:51,290
Do I have to hit like the red part or just the yellow parts?

5121
04:15:51,290 --> 04:15:52,489
Yellow parts, I believe.

5122
04:15:52,489 --> 04:15:55,799
We're not mistaken within the yellows.

5123
04:16:02,389 --> 04:16:04,549
I missed it by like a tiny little bit.

5124
04:16:05,690 --> 04:16:06,409
It's so hard.

5125
04:16:06,409 --> 04:16:07,049
It's awful.

5126
04:16:07,049 --> 04:16:07,860
It's awful.

5127
04:16:07,860 --> 04:16:09,540
So what does anything slow that down?

5128
04:16:09,540 --> 04:16:11,219
Does resource want to slow that down?

5129
04:16:11,219 --> 04:16:15,500
I'm I'm I'm not positive, but I'm pretty close to positive.

5130
04:16:15,500 --> 04:16:20,700
I'm not like I've been told that it does by a respected source.

5131
04:16:20,700 --> 04:16:25,270
Okay.

5132
04:16:25,270 --> 04:16:28,069
Oh, I got I got a friend tango on me, tango on me.

5133
04:16:28,950 --> 04:16:29,670
There's people back.

5134
04:16:29,670 --> 04:16:31,350
No, but you do not want this dude.

5135
04:16:31,350 --> 04:16:33,350
I'm telling you right now in the room we just came from.

5136
04:16:33,350 --> 04:16:34,790
There's a guy as well.

5137
04:16:34,790 --> 04:16:36,149
Fire above the door behind us.

5138
04:16:36,149 --> 04:16:37,030
There's a guy behind us.

5139
04:16:38,229 --> 04:16:46,200
Don't shoot me.

5140
04:16:46,200 --> 04:16:46,680
Don't shoot me.

5141
04:16:46,680 --> 04:16:47,000
Oh, my God.

5142
04:16:47,000 --> 04:16:51,510
I need to heal healing.

5143
04:16:51,510 --> 04:16:52,309
I'll be right there in a second.

5144
04:16:52,309 --> 04:16:54,229
Oh, he just got hit by a mage.

5145
04:16:54,229 --> 04:16:55,190
Oh, my God.

5146
04:16:56,790 --> 04:16:57,190
Careful.

5147
04:16:57,930 --> 04:16:58,809
All right, boys.

5148
04:16:58,809 --> 04:16:59,690
Where's he at?

5149
04:16:59,690 --> 04:17:01,299
They ran.

5150
04:17:01,299 --> 04:17:02,500
There's a mage up here though.

5151
04:17:02,500 --> 04:17:03,620
Left or forward?

5152
04:17:03,620 --> 04:17:04,659
Left or forward?

5153
04:17:04,659 --> 04:17:05,219
Forward.

5154
04:17:05,219 --> 04:17:05,700
Like over here.

5155
04:17:06,659 --> 04:17:07,620
There's a mage in here though.

5156
04:17:07,620 --> 04:17:08,500
Oh, okay.

5157
04:17:08,500 --> 04:17:08,819
Okay.

5158
04:17:08,819 --> 04:17:09,299
There's okay.

5159
04:17:09,299 --> 04:17:09,860
Two tangos.

5160
04:17:09,860 --> 04:17:10,260
Got it.

5161
04:17:10,260 --> 04:17:10,760
Yeah.

5162
04:17:11,379 --> 04:17:12,260
Here's my lock pick room.

5163
04:17:14,459 --> 04:17:15,180
Bueno.

5164
04:17:15,180 --> 04:17:16,459
They're shooting arrows at us, I think.

5165
04:17:17,780 --> 04:17:19,459
I don't know if that's fell down the hole.

5166
04:17:19,459 --> 04:17:20,340
Fell down the hole.

5167
04:17:20,340 --> 04:17:21,459
I fell down the hole.

5168
04:17:21,459 --> 04:17:21,860
Oh, no.

5169
04:17:21,860 --> 04:17:23,459
Fell down the hole on the other room.

5170
04:17:24,180 --> 04:17:26,260
I need to heal before I come get you.

5171
04:17:26,260 --> 04:17:26,659
Or help.

5172
04:17:27,620 --> 04:17:29,610
Fell down the hole.

5173
04:17:29,610 --> 04:17:30,809
Who is shooting?

5174
04:17:30,809 --> 04:17:31,209
That's me.

5175
04:17:31,209 --> 04:17:32,969
There's a barbarian on the other hallway.

5176
04:17:34,329 --> 04:17:34,729
I see.

5177
04:17:36,040 --> 04:17:36,540
Nope.

5178
04:17:38,600 --> 04:17:38,840
Wow.

5179
04:17:38,840 --> 04:17:40,040
I didn't even see the hole.

5180
04:17:40,040 --> 04:17:41,399
Oh, we were doing so well.

5181
04:17:41,399 --> 04:17:42,040
What happened?

5182
04:17:42,040 --> 04:17:42,540
All right.

5183
04:17:44,500 --> 04:17:45,459
If you want to lead them up,

5184
04:17:45,459 --> 04:17:48,180
and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to fire them.

5185
04:17:48,180 --> 04:17:48,819
Oh, beautiful.

5186
04:17:48,819 --> 04:17:49,620
That's a beautiful trap.

5187
04:17:51,940 --> 04:17:52,180
Watch out.

5188
04:17:52,180 --> 04:17:52,819
Hole, hole, hole.

5189
04:17:52,819 --> 04:17:53,379
Watch out.

5190
04:17:53,379 --> 04:17:53,879
Beautiful.

5191
04:17:55,149 --> 04:17:56,909
We're better off closing the door first.

5192
04:17:56,909 --> 04:17:58,590
I'm going to act like the door is fucked.

5193
04:17:58,590 --> 04:17:58,909
Yep.

5194
04:17:58,909 --> 04:17:59,389
Exactly.

5195
04:17:59,389 --> 04:17:59,709
Boom.

5196
04:17:59,709 --> 04:18:00,190
I didn't watch.

5197
04:18:04,680 --> 04:18:13,340
I didn't even see the hole.

5198
04:18:13,340 --> 04:18:15,340
It's like blending into my brain on the screen.

5199
04:18:16,139 --> 04:18:19,500
Oh, you disabled the trap?

5200
04:18:19,500 --> 04:18:21,659
There is an exit down the hole, by the way.

5201
04:18:21,659 --> 04:18:22,780
But there's a shitload of enemies.

5202
04:18:24,799 --> 04:18:25,200
Fuck you.

5203
04:18:25,200 --> 04:18:25,920
Leave the door closed.

5204
04:18:25,920 --> 04:18:26,559
I like it that way.

5205
04:18:27,440 --> 04:18:37,629
Oh, they're shooting me through the...

5206
04:18:38,190 --> 04:18:39,950
I think it's four.

5207
04:18:39,950 --> 04:18:41,229
Bro, that's why you like that.

5208
04:18:41,229 --> 04:18:42,590
That's why the throwing axes are good.

5209
04:18:43,319 --> 04:18:44,280
That's why I like that.

5210
04:18:44,280 --> 04:18:44,920
Three or four people.

5211
04:18:46,670 --> 04:18:47,870
How did you fall down this hole?

5212
04:18:47,870 --> 04:18:50,270
How did I fall down it?

5213
04:18:50,270 --> 04:18:51,309
How did I fall down it?

5214
04:18:51,309 --> 04:18:52,270
You can't even...

5215
04:18:52,270 --> 04:18:53,229
It doesn't make any sense.

5216
04:18:59,530 --> 04:19:03,850
It's like the opposite ends of both extraordinary spectrums there.

5217
04:19:03,850 --> 04:19:05,370
Like, I just...

5218
04:19:05,930 --> 04:19:07,850
I was just teleported down there.

5219
04:19:07,850 --> 04:19:09,049
It was just like, boop.

5220
04:19:09,049 --> 04:19:11,850
And you are desperately trying to fall through it.

5221
04:19:11,850 --> 04:19:13,290
And you can't get through it.

5222
04:19:13,850 --> 04:19:16,280
It doesn't make any sense to my brain.

5223
04:19:16,280 --> 04:19:17,559
I'm a big boy.

5224
04:19:17,559 --> 04:19:19,790
Hard to fit through and you got a full diapy.

5225
04:19:22,750 --> 04:19:23,790
We had two groups.

5226
04:19:23,790 --> 04:19:25,709
There were three to our right and three to our left.

5227
04:19:26,270 --> 04:19:27,399
I may have fallen down a hole.

5228
04:19:27,399 --> 04:19:28,200
But whatever.

5229
04:19:28,200 --> 04:19:28,760
It's all right.

5230
04:19:28,760 --> 04:19:29,399
Let's go.

5231
04:19:29,399 --> 04:19:30,719
Go again.

5232
04:19:30,719 --> 04:19:34,000
Yeah, I'm sorry.

5233
04:19:34,000 --> 04:19:35,680
Yes, just one second.

5234
04:19:35,680 --> 04:19:41,049
I know, I know.

5235
04:19:41,049 --> 04:19:42,090
There have been worse people.

5236
04:19:43,879 --> 04:19:46,280
I literally cannot get kills without weapons.

5237
04:19:46,280 --> 04:19:49,000
That's not the starting weapon on this character.

5238
04:19:49,000 --> 04:19:49,799
That's so funny.

5239
04:19:50,520 --> 04:19:53,719
You know, I know how you feel after I put seven arrows into one zombie's head.

5240
04:19:55,309 --> 04:19:57,950
Yeah, like this is not a game where you use base gear.

5241
04:19:57,950 --> 04:20:00,590
Like, you do not use base gear if you're not...

5242
04:20:00,590 --> 04:20:02,510
Like, if you're doing a scav run, sure.

5243
04:20:02,510 --> 04:20:03,870
Like, where you're literally just looting and running.

5244
04:20:03,870 --> 04:20:05,629
If you want to do one of those, we can do those.

5245
04:20:05,629 --> 04:20:06,750
There's no...

5246
04:20:06,750 --> 04:20:09,639
There's no Fletcher.

5247
04:20:09,639 --> 04:20:11,879
There's no traveling Fletcher.

5248
04:20:11,879 --> 04:20:14,959
You know, I'm going to prove it.

5249
04:20:14,959 --> 04:20:15,520
You know what?

5250
04:20:15,520 --> 04:20:16,159
That's it.

5251
04:20:16,159 --> 04:20:16,959
I got a lot of money.

5252
04:20:16,959 --> 04:20:17,680
That's a good idea.

5253
04:20:18,399 --> 04:20:19,840
You should probably buy gear.

5254
04:20:19,840 --> 04:20:21,600
You'll kill shit a lot faster.

5255
04:20:21,600 --> 04:20:22,559
Yeah, even if...

5256
04:20:22,559 --> 04:20:23,280
I'll make more money.

5257
04:20:24,000 --> 04:20:25,760
I'm going to buy this.

5258
04:20:25,760 --> 04:20:26,319
No, I'm not.

5259
04:20:26,319 --> 04:20:26,879
100 bucks.

5260
04:20:27,520 --> 04:20:27,840
I'm going to...

5261
04:20:27,840 --> 04:20:28,239
You know what?

5262
04:20:28,239 --> 04:20:29,120
Let's gamble.

5263
04:20:29,120 --> 04:20:29,840
I'm going for it.

5264
04:20:29,840 --> 04:20:33,760
I've been waiting to do this for the last, like, two days, three days.

5265
04:20:33,760 --> 04:20:35,840
Stuff kind of sucks.

5266
04:20:35,840 --> 04:20:38,520
I have a Battleaxe here.

5267
04:20:38,520 --> 04:20:41,239
Do you want me to buy it, gamble it, and if it's good, just give it to you?

5268
04:20:43,229 --> 04:20:45,469
Yeah, but if it's trash, I'm going to feel bad, you know?

5269
04:20:45,469 --> 04:20:48,600
I mean, I have money.

5270
04:20:48,600 --> 04:20:49,559
I mean, yeah, dude.

5271
04:20:49,559 --> 04:20:50,600
I'll try it once.

5272
04:20:50,600 --> 04:20:51,159
Is it worth it?

5273
04:20:53,440 --> 04:20:54,319
I have heard bad...

5274
04:20:54,319 --> 04:20:56,159
Wait, are you talking about the Goblin Battleaxe guy?

5275
04:20:56,159 --> 04:20:57,760
I got a green Battleaxe.

5276
04:20:57,760 --> 04:21:00,719
47 damage plus 2.5% physical damage.

5277
04:21:00,719 --> 04:21:01,850
Do you want it?

5278
04:21:01,850 --> 04:21:02,489
Yeah, I'll run it.

5279
04:21:02,489 --> 04:21:02,889
Absolutely.

5280
04:21:02,889 --> 04:21:03,370
Okay, all right.

5281
04:21:03,370 --> 04:21:05,930
I'm going to try it at least once.

5282
04:21:05,930 --> 04:21:06,489
Yeah.

5283
04:21:06,489 --> 04:21:07,129
That's pretty good.

5284
04:21:07,129 --> 04:21:07,850
Green, yeah.

5285
04:21:07,850 --> 04:21:09,930
Yeah, that's a lot better than what I have, so...

5286
04:21:09,930 --> 04:21:12,139
Yeah, okay.

5287
04:21:12,139 --> 04:21:12,620
And then I'm just going to...

5288
04:21:12,620 --> 04:21:16,270
I have a short sword for you, by the way, Stern.

5289
04:21:16,270 --> 04:21:16,590
Okay.

5290
04:21:17,979 --> 04:21:19,180
I don't want to bring this.

5291
04:21:19,180 --> 04:21:20,569
I'm going to lose it.

5292
04:21:20,569 --> 04:21:26,059
I'm bringing two Lockpicks that I'm going to immediately drop.

5293
04:21:26,059 --> 04:21:27,739
Oh, who sells the Lockpicks?

5294
04:21:27,739 --> 04:21:29,600
I believe Blacksmith.

5295
04:21:29,600 --> 04:21:30,079
Let me check.

5296
04:21:31,950 --> 04:21:35,020
Or I am wrong.

5297
04:21:35,020 --> 04:21:35,420
Maybe...

5298
04:21:42,909 --> 04:21:44,350
Interesting choice.

5299
04:21:44,350 --> 04:21:46,040
No, the Woodsman doesn't have them for me.

5300
04:21:46,040 --> 04:21:47,399
Maybe it's a momentary thing.

5301
04:21:51,739 --> 04:21:55,420
They all just, for me, they're all selling default gear

5302
04:21:55,420 --> 04:22:00,059
that you don't want to buy for very large amounts of money.

5303
04:22:01,799 --> 04:22:03,500
8 to like 10.

5304
04:22:03,500 --> 04:22:04,379
Maybe because I'm level 2.

5305
04:22:07,069 --> 04:22:07,629
Stern, I'll get you something.

5306
04:22:07,629 --> 04:22:08,190
What do you want?

5307
04:22:08,190 --> 04:22:09,930
No, I'm good.

5308
04:22:09,930 --> 04:22:10,649
I want to start.

5309
04:22:11,690 --> 04:22:17,690
Yeah, I hate to bring this up, but there is a Purple's Y-Hander on my merch.

5310
04:22:17,690 --> 04:22:18,889
Just wanted to let you know that.

5311
04:22:18,889 --> 04:22:22,829
I know you're a big...

5312
04:22:22,829 --> 04:22:26,250
I am a pretty big Zweiander fan.

5313
04:22:26,250 --> 04:22:29,020
I'm just going to get some default shit.

5314
04:22:29,020 --> 04:22:32,090
Why not?

5315
04:22:32,090 --> 04:22:33,879
Just don't buy grays.

5316
04:22:33,879 --> 04:22:36,200
If you buy a white for eight gold, that makes sense

5317
04:22:36,200 --> 04:22:39,819
because it's at least slightly better in some runs.

5318
04:22:39,819 --> 04:22:42,969
But if you can buy greens off the merchant, that's fine.

5319
04:22:42,969 --> 04:22:46,250
Oh, you said do not buy gray items.

5320
04:22:46,250 --> 04:22:46,989
Correct.

5321
04:22:46,989 --> 04:22:47,389
Okay.

5322
04:22:47,389 --> 04:22:48,430
Just don't bother.

5323
04:22:48,430 --> 04:22:52,510
No, so don't bother at all.

5324
04:22:52,510 --> 04:22:52,989
Okay.

5325
04:22:52,989 --> 04:22:54,700
I see what you mean.

5326
04:22:54,700 --> 04:22:55,260
Oh, no.

5327
04:22:55,260 --> 04:22:59,610
Make sure I clarify that and I want to make sure I get it right.

5328
04:23:00,809 --> 04:23:01,530
Oh, nice.

5329
04:23:01,690 --> 04:23:07,629
Is that a gray weapon or stuff from the Armorsmith?

5330
04:23:07,629 --> 04:23:08,350
I had it from before.

5331
04:23:08,909 --> 04:23:10,670
I just want to make sure I didn't do something stupid.

5332
04:23:11,389 --> 04:23:13,469
If anything, if it means anything, you look for it.

5333
04:23:13,469 --> 04:23:15,610
All right.

5334
04:23:15,610 --> 04:23:16,489
I got a cool axe for you.

5335
04:23:17,469 --> 04:23:18,510
Oh, God bless.

5336
04:23:18,510 --> 04:23:26,200
Here you go.

5337
04:23:26,200 --> 04:23:27,319
Oh, you're a madman.

5338
04:23:27,319 --> 04:23:29,930
Do not pick up these because they're crap.

5339
04:23:31,209 --> 04:23:32,010
Holy shit.

5340
04:23:33,049 --> 04:23:33,690
That's right.

5341
04:23:36,430 --> 04:23:37,309
That's the lobby.

5342
04:23:39,200 --> 04:23:40,479
Did you just drop stuff?

5343
04:23:40,479 --> 04:23:41,360
He did, dude.

5344
04:23:41,360 --> 04:23:42,719
He's a madman.

5345
04:23:43,040 --> 04:23:47,340
Actually, bro, you are the catalyst of chaos.

5346
04:23:47,340 --> 04:23:48,860
Holy shit, dude.

5347
04:23:48,860 --> 04:23:49,819
I'm sorry.

5348
04:23:49,819 --> 04:23:50,540
Did you get it?

5349
04:23:51,180 --> 04:23:51,979
I got it, bro.

5350
04:23:51,979 --> 04:23:54,620
But I had to go through Stern's body, too.

5351
04:23:54,620 --> 04:23:57,100
I was like, oh, my God, please don't be another player.

5352
04:23:59,120 --> 04:23:59,440
All right.

5353
04:23:59,440 --> 04:23:59,920
Here's your sword.

5354
04:23:59,920 --> 04:24:00,479
Here's your sword.

5355
04:24:02,940 --> 04:24:03,659
Oh, my God.

5356
04:24:03,659 --> 04:24:05,020
I just I'm not even realizing.

5357
04:24:05,020 --> 04:24:06,299
Oh, God, bro.

5358
04:24:06,299 --> 04:24:06,860
Jesus.

5359
04:24:08,620 --> 04:24:11,020
Jesus.

5360
04:24:16,040 --> 04:24:17,479
I got to get a hold of myself here.

5361
04:24:18,200 --> 04:24:18,600
All right.

5362
04:24:20,110 --> 04:24:22,489
Did you get the lockpicks?

5363
04:24:22,489 --> 04:24:22,729
Yes.

5364
04:24:23,450 --> 04:24:25,680
Here you go.

5365
04:24:25,680 --> 04:24:26,159
Oh, good.

5366
04:24:26,159 --> 04:24:27,040
I thought I killed him.

5367
04:24:27,040 --> 04:24:28,350
Jesus.

5368
04:24:28,350 --> 04:24:31,629
There is a good armor here for people that like wearing armor.

5369
04:24:32,190 --> 04:24:32,590
Watch out.

5370
04:24:32,590 --> 04:24:38,350
He's oh, God.

5371
04:24:38,350 --> 04:24:39,870
I'm going to hit this lockpick.

5372
04:24:39,870 --> 04:24:40,639
God.

5373
04:24:40,639 --> 04:24:41,760
Oh, you got this.

5374
04:24:41,760 --> 04:24:42,559
So big.

5375
04:24:42,559 --> 04:24:43,920
I'm going to hit it big.

5376
04:24:44,479 --> 04:24:45,440
Hit it big.

5377
04:24:45,440 --> 04:24:46,639
Hit it well.

5378
04:24:46,639 --> 04:24:48,399
Come on, Stern.

5379
04:24:48,399 --> 04:24:50,590
We believe in you.

5380
04:24:50,590 --> 04:24:52,989
Can you just can you watch it go around once?

5381
04:24:55,399 --> 04:24:56,040
I believe not.

5382
04:24:56,040 --> 04:24:57,239
I think you have to just do it.

5383
04:24:58,170 --> 04:25:00,329
It comes up at such a random time.

5384
04:25:00,889 --> 04:25:02,809
I'm not used to where it is on the screen.

5385
04:25:04,520 --> 04:25:05,000
It changes.

5386
04:25:05,000 --> 04:25:05,719
It changes.

5387
04:25:05,719 --> 04:25:06,920
That's the fun part.

5388
04:25:06,920 --> 04:25:07,639
Take this.

5389
04:25:07,639 --> 04:25:10,649
Take this chest plate, please.

5390
04:25:10,649 --> 04:25:11,530
Come on, dude.

5391
04:25:11,530 --> 04:25:12,250
Fucking get it.

5392
04:25:17,159 --> 04:25:19,399
I thought you're going to run on the traps and off yourself.

5393
04:25:19,399 --> 04:25:22,079
Can you take this?

5394
04:25:22,079 --> 04:25:22,719
I can't wear that.

5395
04:25:22,719 --> 04:25:24,159
I mean, I'm it.

5396
04:25:24,159 --> 04:25:26,079
I meant wait, wait, wait.

5397
04:25:26,079 --> 04:25:26,639
Hold on, Stern.

5398
04:25:26,639 --> 04:25:30,270
Did I just do like 20% of your health in one punch?

5399
04:25:30,270 --> 04:25:32,110
No, the punches don't mess around.

5400
04:25:32,110 --> 04:25:33,950
They're like 20 damage, at least.

5401
04:25:33,950 --> 04:25:36,430
I I thought it.

5402
04:25:36,430 --> 04:25:36,750
All right.

5403
04:25:36,750 --> 04:25:37,069
All right.

5404
04:25:37,069 --> 04:25:38,110
I did it once.

5405
04:25:38,190 --> 04:25:39,629
I did it once.

5406
04:25:39,629 --> 04:25:41,069
I did it once.

5407
04:25:41,069 --> 04:25:42,030
You want to even it out?

5408
04:25:42,030 --> 04:25:42,670
That's what happened.

5409
04:25:42,670 --> 04:25:43,389
Diabe.

5410
04:25:43,389 --> 04:25:44,829
That's what's he doing?

5411
04:25:44,829 --> 04:25:45,870
Why are you doing this?

5412
04:25:45,870 --> 04:25:53,159
You just feel like I just feel like I'm getting bullied.

5413
04:25:53,159 --> 04:25:55,799
I'm angry because I failed the jump scare twice.

5414
04:25:57,879 --> 04:25:58,280
All right.

5415
04:25:58,280 --> 04:25:58,680
All right.

5416
04:25:58,680 --> 04:25:58,920
All right.

5417
04:25:58,920 --> 04:26:00,520
Let's fucking go for it.

5418
04:26:00,520 --> 04:26:01,399
Civil War.

5419
04:26:02,280 --> 04:26:11,719
Secret wall.

5420
04:26:11,719 --> 04:26:15,799
Again, that's almost stepped on.

5421
04:26:15,799 --> 04:26:16,440
Oh, my God.

5422
04:26:16,440 --> 04:26:17,879
I almost stepped on the trap there.

5423
04:26:20,430 --> 04:26:23,760
Let us know to be fair.

5424
04:26:23,760 --> 04:26:25,600
It really is like impossible.

5425
04:26:26,590 --> 04:26:27,309
It's rough.

5426
04:26:27,309 --> 04:26:28,670
It shouldn't be as hard as it is.

5427
04:26:28,670 --> 04:26:30,670
But I guess the reward is really great

5428
04:26:30,670 --> 04:26:32,270
because there could be something really amazing.

5429
04:26:44,670 --> 04:26:46,319
I want to be able to see.

5430
04:26:50,680 --> 04:26:51,479
Oh, there's a tomb.

5431
04:26:57,040 --> 04:26:58,879
We got tangos by us.

5432
04:26:59,770 --> 04:27:01,450
Rogue helmet on the ground.

5433
04:27:06,329 --> 04:27:08,409
I think they're north.

5434
04:27:08,409 --> 04:27:10,010
Maybe watch out tangos.

5435
04:27:17,180 --> 04:27:19,100
Yeah, because those don't go off for no reason.

5436
04:27:19,100 --> 04:27:20,780
So they're absolutely fighting something.

5437
04:27:21,579 --> 04:27:23,020
Well, let them let them get hurt.

5438
04:27:24,969 --> 04:27:26,090
Oh, he's metagaming.

5439
04:27:27,420 --> 04:27:28,459
I mean, that's what you said.

5440
04:27:29,930 --> 04:27:32,649
That's we're going by the smartest gamer in the room right now.

5441
04:27:32,649 --> 04:27:34,090
I think it might actually it might be.

5442
04:27:35,209 --> 04:27:35,930
I'll calm down.

5443
04:27:35,930 --> 04:27:36,729
Calm down.

5444
04:27:36,729 --> 04:27:38,250
My knowledge is five.

5445
04:27:38,250 --> 04:27:41,209
OK, I have to I have to open this

5446
04:27:41,209 --> 04:27:42,809
because I have to go get that health over there.

5447
04:27:42,809 --> 04:27:43,610
Watch the spider.

5448
04:27:43,610 --> 04:27:44,969
So spiders welcoming.

5449
04:27:46,329 --> 04:27:46,649
All right.

5450
04:27:46,649 --> 04:27:50,409
Running through running through and spawning these.

5451
04:27:50,409 --> 04:27:51,530
Come help me kill them.

5452
04:27:51,530 --> 04:27:52,090
Pressing E.

5453
04:27:53,049 --> 04:27:53,450
Kill.

5454
04:27:55,049 --> 04:28:00,809
Can you shoot the scaly archer jail?

5455
04:28:01,610 --> 04:28:01,850
Yeah.

5456
04:28:02,409 --> 04:28:03,690
Otherwise, he's going to farm me.

5457
04:28:07,709 --> 04:28:16,559
I'm doing it.

5458
04:28:16,559 --> 04:28:17,600
I'm shooting them.

5459
04:28:20,159 --> 04:28:21,200
He's not.

5460
04:28:21,200 --> 04:28:22,000
Oh, there's like loading.

5461
04:28:22,000 --> 04:28:24,000
There's like bugs, whatever they are stuck under there.

5462
04:28:24,719 --> 04:28:26,399
Careful, like bat things.

5463
04:28:26,399 --> 04:28:26,959
Getting them.

5464
04:28:28,239 --> 04:28:28,959
I'm shooting them.

5465
04:28:31,120 --> 04:28:31,600
Oh, my God.

5466
04:28:33,440 --> 04:28:34,399
What the fuck?

5467
04:28:35,120 --> 04:28:37,200
These should be an arrow.

5468
04:28:37,200 --> 04:28:37,600
Oh, yeah.

5469
04:28:37,600 --> 04:28:41,229
You I was shooting that guy and you know.

5470
04:28:41,229 --> 04:28:42,110
Why would it be accurate to me?

5471
04:28:42,110 --> 04:28:42,750
That was not you.

5472
04:28:43,309 --> 04:28:50,010
Jews in here.

5473
04:28:50,010 --> 04:28:52,940
But man, that's an emerald.

5474
04:28:58,030 --> 04:29:01,239
Diabla, do you have bandages?

5475
04:29:03,709 --> 04:29:07,950
He should have a campfire, which is I believe I have one.

5476
04:29:08,920 --> 04:29:09,559
I have two.

5477
04:29:09,559 --> 04:29:13,469
If you want to heal without us needing to use the campfire.

5478
04:29:13,469 --> 04:29:15,629
I have food I can eat as well.

5479
04:29:15,629 --> 04:29:16,510
Oh, that's right.

5480
04:29:16,510 --> 04:29:17,069
That's true.

5481
04:29:17,069 --> 04:29:18,829
But that almost is like too good.

5482
04:29:18,829 --> 04:29:20,569
And well, it's OK.

5483
04:29:20,569 --> 04:29:24,809
Although I will say that that health shrine does regen if we chill here for a sec.

5484
04:29:24,809 --> 04:29:30,719
Oh, oh, my.

5485
04:29:30,719 --> 04:29:33,760
Have you stand next to this altar of sacrifice?

5486
04:29:33,760 --> 04:29:34,719
It whispers.

5487
04:29:34,719 --> 04:29:35,520
Have you heard it?

5488
04:29:35,520 --> 04:29:37,870
It's scary, actually.

5489
04:29:37,870 --> 04:29:43,229
Repeat this crap is now.

5490
04:29:44,680 --> 04:29:46,120
Well, not quite yet.

5491
04:29:46,120 --> 04:29:48,360
I'll keep it for now because I buy a lot.

5492
04:29:48,360 --> 04:29:49,319
I got a long suit.

5493
04:29:51,290 --> 04:29:53,920
Oh, you did.

5494
04:29:53,920 --> 04:29:55,920
I would love to take that.

5495
04:29:55,920 --> 04:29:56,780
What do you?

5496
04:29:56,780 --> 04:29:57,420
Oh, yeah.

5497
04:29:57,420 --> 04:29:59,760
Oh, you salute me.

5498
04:30:02,139 --> 04:30:05,180
Yeah.

5499
04:30:05,180 --> 04:30:05,819
Cool.

5500
04:30:05,819 --> 04:30:08,079
Beautiful.

5501
04:30:08,079 --> 04:30:09,930
Cool.

5502
04:30:09,930 --> 04:30:10,489
Cool.

5503
04:30:10,489 --> 04:30:14,799
Cool.

5504
04:30:14,799 --> 04:30:15,120
Cool.

5505
04:30:15,120 --> 04:30:17,020
Oh, wow.

5506
04:30:17,020 --> 04:30:17,420
Mimic.

5507
04:30:17,420 --> 04:30:18,139
Still gets me.

5508
04:30:18,139 --> 04:30:18,940
Still gets me.

5509
04:30:18,940 --> 04:30:21,920
Oh, cool, cool, cool.

5510
04:30:26,479 --> 04:30:28,479
I just feel cool with the longsword.

5511
04:30:28,479 --> 04:30:30,239
It's just the swing is so cool.

5512
04:30:30,239 --> 04:30:31,120
I like the second swing.

5513
04:30:31,120 --> 04:30:31,760
It's my favorite.

5514
04:30:31,760 --> 04:30:34,399
So do the mimics have better stuff in them?

5515
04:30:34,399 --> 04:30:35,360
I was just going to bring that up.

5516
04:30:35,360 --> 04:30:39,120
You would think, but I have not seen anything with that.

5517
04:30:46,200 --> 04:30:46,700
OK.

5518
04:30:49,200 --> 04:30:50,479
This way, probably.

5519
04:30:50,479 --> 04:30:51,200
Look through.

5520
04:30:51,200 --> 04:30:52,639
If you're through, I don't see anything.

5521
04:30:52,639 --> 04:30:54,000
Yeah, we can go.

5522
04:30:54,079 --> 04:31:01,469
It will just make two lefts and basically reroute in to the circle.

5523
04:31:01,469 --> 04:31:06,110
There have been looters here.

5524
04:31:06,110 --> 04:31:07,309
I'm going to deal.

5525
04:31:07,309 --> 04:31:08,620
Let's get the full health.

5526
04:31:12,639 --> 04:31:15,440
People always want to do it in this little area in here.

5527
04:31:15,440 --> 04:31:16,559
This little hidey hole.

5528
04:31:16,559 --> 04:31:19,180
Let's do it.

5529
04:31:19,180 --> 04:31:20,059
Let's go in.

5530
04:31:20,059 --> 04:31:21,950
It'll be super safe when I close the lever.

5531
04:31:24,799 --> 04:31:26,159
But there'll be stuff in here.

5532
04:31:26,159 --> 04:31:28,190
I'll say that.

5533
04:31:28,909 --> 04:31:31,309
For some reason, I had assumed you'd use campfire.

5534
04:31:31,309 --> 04:31:33,709
Do you want this helmet?

5535
04:31:33,709 --> 04:31:35,469
It's a plus four physical power green.

5536
04:31:35,469 --> 04:31:39,639
I feel like you should be the one that has this on the ground.

5537
04:31:39,639 --> 04:31:40,280
Oh, wow.

5538
04:31:40,280 --> 04:31:42,750
Yes, I would love that.

5539
04:31:42,750 --> 04:31:48,889
You are the physical power, important wielder of acts.

5540
04:31:48,889 --> 04:31:55,530
You can't break with torches.

5541
04:31:55,530 --> 04:31:56,729
Oh, wow.

5542
04:31:56,729 --> 04:31:58,569
Maybe I should have just left it closed.

5543
04:31:58,569 --> 04:32:00,209
Oh, shit.

5544
04:32:14,510 --> 04:32:15,790
Oh, we got bugs.

5545
04:32:15,790 --> 04:32:16,350
Poison bug.

5546
04:32:16,909 --> 04:32:19,049
Did I get hit by it?

5547
04:32:19,930 --> 04:32:20,409
I did.

5548
04:32:20,409 --> 04:32:20,649
How?

5549
04:32:20,649 --> 04:32:21,450
I was behind the wall.

5550
04:32:42,090 --> 04:32:44,489
That poison gas is just such a great zoner.

5551
04:32:44,489 --> 04:32:45,049
It's the worst.

5552
04:32:46,170 --> 04:32:46,670
Yep.

5553
04:32:52,280 --> 04:32:53,239
Did I hit you?

5554
04:32:53,239 --> 04:32:53,479
Nope.

5555
04:32:53,479 --> 04:32:53,959
Thank God.

5556
04:32:56,569 --> 04:32:56,809
All right.

5557
04:32:56,809 --> 04:32:57,610
We got to run, run.

5558
04:32:58,809 --> 04:32:59,690
You should take Doris.

5559
04:33:05,479 --> 04:33:06,040
Oh, my God.

5560
04:33:06,040 --> 04:33:07,000
Get out of the fucking way.

5561
04:33:13,599 --> 04:33:15,360
We got to get the hell out of here right now.

5562
04:33:24,299 --> 04:33:28,330
We'll be all right.

5563
04:33:28,330 --> 04:33:28,830
Beautiful.

5564
04:33:30,970 --> 04:33:31,689
What the fuck?

5565
04:33:31,689 --> 04:33:33,080
Isn't that an archer?

5566
04:33:33,080 --> 04:33:33,799
Oh, what is it?

5567
04:33:33,799 --> 04:33:35,799
No, we got players shooting for us across the way.

5568
04:33:35,799 --> 04:33:38,880
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

5569
04:33:38,880 --> 04:33:40,159
I need to heal somewhere.

5570
04:33:41,119 --> 04:33:42,560
That guy's got a big ass shield.

5571
04:33:42,560 --> 04:33:43,439
I'm going to sit here for a second.

5572
04:33:44,000 --> 04:33:47,840
Yep.

5573
04:33:47,840 --> 04:33:48,560
Careful, Ster.

5574
04:33:48,560 --> 04:33:49,919
Oh, I actually don't have heals.

5575
04:33:49,919 --> 04:33:50,560
This is amazing.

5576
04:33:51,680 --> 04:33:53,279
I have a bandage and I have a potion.

5577
04:33:53,279 --> 04:33:53,840
You should put it here.

5578
04:33:53,840 --> 04:33:54,340
Let me.

5579
04:33:57,580 --> 04:34:00,380
Yeah, if you appreciate it.

5580
04:34:00,380 --> 04:34:01,180
Thank you, thank you.

5581
04:34:01,180 --> 04:34:02,220
Oh, gosh.

5582
04:34:02,220 --> 04:34:02,779
Did you get them both?

5583
04:34:04,040 --> 04:34:04,599
Yeah, thank you.

5584
04:34:05,639 --> 04:34:07,959
It's better in your hands than it is in mine.

5585
04:34:07,959 --> 04:34:09,610
No, no, no.

5586
04:34:09,610 --> 04:34:10,330
We are a team.

5587
04:34:14,189 --> 04:34:16,270
Well, apparently he has a good aim.

5588
04:34:16,270 --> 04:34:17,630
And I fucking jumped down.

5589
04:34:17,630 --> 04:34:19,470
I did a movement speed buff.

5590
04:34:19,470 --> 04:34:22,029
I did a movement speed buff and everything and I didn't make it.

5591
04:34:22,669 --> 04:34:23,389
Actually, I'll shut up.

5592
04:34:23,389 --> 04:34:23,709
Sorry.

5593
04:34:23,709 --> 04:34:24,430
I'm dead.

5594
04:34:24,430 --> 04:34:27,000
Like, there's no getting out of this.

5595
04:34:27,000 --> 04:34:28,380
Owie.

5596
04:34:28,380 --> 04:34:35,340
So how did I not get that?

5597
04:34:35,340 --> 04:34:38,569
I the jump there is kind of trash sometimes.

5598
04:34:38,569 --> 04:34:41,450
I even did movement speed and I like just I waited as long as I could.

5599
04:34:41,450 --> 04:34:47,599
I just didn't make it.

5600
04:34:47,599 --> 04:34:48,080
Oh, it's good.

5601
04:34:48,080 --> 04:34:50,720
I think I was slow from all the gear I had on.

5602
04:34:50,720 --> 04:34:51,119
All right.

5603
04:34:51,119 --> 04:34:52,400
I think we should be a little toxic.

5604
04:34:53,659 --> 04:34:54,779
I have an idea.

5605
04:34:54,779 --> 04:35:03,790
Grouch jump for extra height.

5606
04:35:03,790 --> 04:35:08,270
It doesn't really help with distance, but he is right.

5607
04:35:09,659 --> 04:35:11,740
I think I just had too much gear on.

5608
04:35:11,740 --> 04:35:15,180
I just didn't realize because I thought, oh, I'm going to do my movement speed buff

5609
04:35:15,180 --> 04:35:16,220
and I'll be able to get some momentum.

5610
04:35:16,220 --> 04:35:19,229
It just didn't help.

5611
04:35:19,229 --> 04:35:19,869
Wait.

5612
04:35:19,869 --> 04:35:23,819
Nothing's changed.

5613
04:35:23,819 --> 04:35:26,430
What's up?

5614
04:35:26,430 --> 04:35:27,470
I don't even have it on.

5615
04:35:29,770 --> 04:35:32,270
Oh, that's interesting.

5616
04:35:32,270 --> 04:35:34,590
I must have changed it and forgot that I changed it.

5617
04:35:37,680 --> 04:35:39,040
I haven't been doing movement speed.

5618
04:35:39,040 --> 04:35:41,840
I've been doing victory, victory strike.

5619
04:35:41,840 --> 04:35:46,029
So every time I press that, I'm just trying to run fast.

5620
04:35:46,029 --> 04:35:50,540
Sir, thank you so much for the raid.

5621
04:35:51,930 --> 04:35:52,889
Stir to the right song.

5622
04:35:56,200 --> 04:35:57,720
What do the raid song?

5623
04:35:58,360 --> 04:35:59,340
That's not a raid song.

5624
04:35:59,340 --> 04:35:59,979
It's a break song.

5625
04:35:59,979 --> 04:36:00,700
But do you want to hear it?

5626
04:36:00,700 --> 04:36:03,819
It's actually kind of I actually no, I'm good.

5627
04:36:04,540 --> 04:36:05,419
I'm not going to sing it.

5628
04:36:05,419 --> 04:36:06,619
I was going to play it in a stream.

5629
04:36:06,619 --> 04:36:07,340
Geez.

5630
04:36:07,340 --> 04:36:07,659
Okay.

5631
04:36:07,659 --> 04:36:08,540
Never mind.

5632
04:36:08,540 --> 04:36:09,340
Okay.

5633
04:36:09,340 --> 04:36:10,220
Okay.

5634
04:36:10,220 --> 04:36:13,130
Jeremy, can you do the raid song?

5635
04:36:13,130 --> 04:36:16,349
Oh, story.

5636
04:36:16,349 --> 04:36:20,159
Are you are you on your way out here?

5637
04:36:20,159 --> 04:36:22,639
Um, I can play like another.

5638
04:36:22,639 --> 04:36:25,229
I like what I mean.

5639
04:36:25,229 --> 04:36:26,590
I've been up a while.

5640
04:36:26,590 --> 04:36:27,150
I like this.

5641
04:36:27,150 --> 04:36:27,709
Right.

5642
04:36:27,709 --> 04:36:27,950
Right.

5643
04:36:27,950 --> 04:36:28,590
Gosh.

5644
04:36:28,590 --> 04:36:32,490
Wrong.

5645
04:36:32,490 --> 04:36:32,970
All right.

5646
04:36:32,970 --> 04:36:34,799
Let's do let's do another one.

5647
04:36:34,799 --> 04:36:37,130
Let's go for real this time.

5648
04:36:37,130 --> 04:36:37,369
All right.

5649
04:36:37,369 --> 04:36:39,180
Let's run it.

5650
04:36:39,180 --> 04:36:40,380
We are arranged kings.

5651
04:36:44,110 --> 04:36:44,590
So it's funny.

5652
04:36:44,590 --> 04:36:47,150
You rated me right as I put up my BRB screen, right?

5653
04:36:47,709 --> 04:36:48,909
Which has a song that I made.

5654
04:36:51,130 --> 04:36:54,490
No, no, I just I put it up for a second because I got up for a second

5655
04:36:54,490 --> 04:36:58,169
because like anytime I get up from my desk, I still have the ability to hear

5656
04:36:58,169 --> 04:36:59,849
because I have wireless headphones.

5657
04:36:59,849 --> 04:37:00,409
Anyways.

5658
04:37:00,409 --> 04:37:00,810
Oh, cool.

5659
04:37:00,810 --> 04:37:02,409
And like when you came in, you like do the raid song.

5660
04:37:02,409 --> 04:37:04,409
I thought you meant like my song was the raid song.

5661
04:37:04,409 --> 04:37:05,930
I didn't even know there was a raid song.

5662
04:37:05,930 --> 04:37:07,209
Oh, I don't know.

5663
04:37:07,209 --> 04:37:07,770
That's why I don't.

5664
04:37:09,639 --> 04:37:12,380
My brain checked out with the worm.

5665
04:37:12,380 --> 04:37:13,740
You think you can test the meat?

5666
04:37:13,740 --> 04:37:14,139
Look at me.

5667
04:37:14,139 --> 04:37:15,099
It's all gone.

5668
04:37:15,099 --> 04:37:21,659
It's always funny to hear the the 0.5 seconds people have in the voice chat in the lobby

5669
04:37:21,659 --> 04:37:24,380
and they're just going to get their one sentence out, whatever it is.

5670
04:37:24,380 --> 04:38:03,549
Got something over here.

5671
04:38:03,549 --> 04:38:04,509
Oh, what is this?

5672
04:38:04,509 --> 04:38:06,509
Is this just not is this a weird?

5673
04:38:06,509 --> 04:38:08,590
That's where the people used to spawn in.

5674
04:38:08,590 --> 04:38:13,689
Remember how like everybody was like like those little boxes on the outskirts of the map.

5675
04:38:13,689 --> 04:38:16,569
You just like well, I guess you just you didn't play earlier, did you?

5676
04:38:16,569 --> 04:38:16,970
No, I didn't.

5677
04:38:16,970 --> 04:38:20,119
This is the first test I played in the earlier play test.

5678
04:38:20,119 --> 04:38:20,759
Oh, check this out.

5679
04:38:20,759 --> 04:38:23,159
Check this out and fire sword.

5680
04:38:23,159 --> 04:38:26,619
Have fun and fire bow.

5681
04:38:29,000 --> 04:38:29,560
I'm so afraid.

5682
04:38:29,560 --> 04:38:31,560
I'm going to this thing is the fire.

5683
04:38:31,560 --> 04:38:32,599
So it's freaking me out.

5684
04:38:32,599 --> 04:38:33,000
I don't know.

5685
04:38:33,000 --> 04:38:34,599
I can't I can't I can't fucking use it.

5686
04:38:36,040 --> 04:38:37,400
I can't play with it.

5687
04:38:37,400 --> 04:38:38,200
It's weird.

5688
04:38:38,840 --> 04:38:39,720
I think it was a deep off.

5689
04:38:39,720 --> 04:38:40,840
Don't give that to me again.

5690
04:38:40,840 --> 04:38:41,639
That was a debuff.

5691
04:38:42,279 --> 04:38:43,680
All right.

5692
04:38:43,680 --> 04:38:44,479
Well, you know what?

5693
04:38:44,479 --> 04:38:47,040
Honestly, I'm just going to go off the wizard.

5694
04:38:47,040 --> 04:38:47,360
Sorry.

5695
04:38:47,360 --> 04:38:47,680
I'm sorry.

5696
04:38:47,680 --> 04:38:49,119
I thought this was a good idea.

5697
04:38:49,200 --> 04:38:52,240
It was just too I was so foreign to me too much power.

5698
04:38:52,240 --> 04:38:56,080
It just was so foreign to me that I just it was something I'd never seen.

5699
04:39:00,169 --> 04:39:02,889
There's a wraith in here that I think we might be able to kill a little bit of.

5700
04:39:03,770 --> 04:39:04,169
Never mind.

5701
04:39:04,169 --> 04:39:05,450
It's an awful lot.

5702
04:39:05,450 --> 04:39:06,990
Why can I not break?

5703
04:39:07,950 --> 04:39:17,549
You just got to believe points incoming.

5704
04:39:17,549 --> 04:39:18,189
Thanks, Jerma.

5705
04:39:18,189 --> 04:39:19,470
Well, you don't know that actually.

5706
04:39:25,279 --> 04:39:26,159
Thanks, but no thanks.

5707
04:39:26,159 --> 04:39:27,599
Thanks, but no thanks to what?

5708
04:39:27,599 --> 04:39:28,400
Oh, friends.

5709
04:39:28,400 --> 04:39:28,639
All right.

5710
04:39:28,639 --> 04:39:29,439
Watch out.

5711
04:39:29,439 --> 04:39:30,240
Hold on.

5712
04:39:30,240 --> 04:39:31,799
So here's the fun part.

5713
04:39:31,799 --> 04:39:34,840
We get to be so toxic with your arrows and my fireballs.

5714
04:39:37,040 --> 04:39:39,279
And my apps and my thank you.

5715
04:39:39,279 --> 04:39:40,639
I was trying to get to the exit.

5716
04:39:40,639 --> 04:39:41,040
We came in.

5717
04:39:41,040 --> 04:39:41,439
It's coming in.

5718
04:39:41,439 --> 04:39:43,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5719
04:39:43,680 --> 04:39:44,799
And I'm dead.

5720
04:39:44,799 --> 04:39:45,520
Beautiful.

5721
04:39:45,520 --> 04:39:46,159
All right.

5722
04:39:46,159 --> 04:39:47,119
This one doesn't count.

5723
04:39:47,119 --> 04:39:47,619
No.

5724
04:39:49,290 --> 04:39:49,790
That one.

5725
04:39:50,330 --> 04:39:51,290
Oh, there's somebody behind me.

5726
04:39:51,290 --> 04:39:55,639
Fuck.

5727
04:39:55,639 --> 04:39:57,080
There's no way we're letting that happen.

5728
04:39:57,080 --> 04:39:57,560
There's no way.

5729
04:39:57,560 --> 04:39:58,040
I'm sorry.

5730
04:39:58,040 --> 04:39:58,540
Nope.

5731
04:39:59,159 --> 04:39:59,659
I'm done.

5732
04:40:00,840 --> 04:40:01,479
Hey, bedtime.

5733
04:40:03,849 --> 04:40:04,569
Get real late.

5734
04:40:05,950 --> 04:40:07,229
I got to go get in my crib.

5735
04:40:09,049 --> 04:40:09,849
Understandable.

5736
04:40:09,849 --> 04:40:11,900
Thank you, sir.

5737
04:40:11,900 --> 04:40:13,020
Yeah, no problem.

5738
04:40:13,020 --> 04:40:14,060
And it was nice meeting you.

5739
04:40:14,060 --> 04:40:15,020
And also thank you for the raid.

5740
04:40:15,020 --> 04:40:15,900
It was really nice.

5741
04:40:15,900 --> 04:40:16,860
Yeah, yeah, no problem.

5742
04:40:16,860 --> 04:40:17,840
Good night.

5743
04:40:17,840 --> 04:40:18,959
See you later, Sterk.

5744
04:40:18,959 --> 04:40:20,000
Thanks for playing.

5745
04:40:20,000 --> 04:40:22,840
Sterk is a good dude.

5746
04:40:23,950 --> 04:40:24,590
So what's your plan?

5747
04:40:25,150 --> 04:40:29,119
I might want to do some solo goblin stuff now that I have like a cool weapon.

5748
04:40:29,119 --> 04:40:31,389
Yeah, absolutely.

5749
04:40:31,389 --> 04:40:33,150
But I think that's great.

5750
04:40:33,150 --> 04:40:35,229
It's also a great way to get a lot of loot, a lot of money.

5751
04:40:35,229 --> 04:40:36,220
Yeah.

5752
04:40:36,220 --> 04:40:38,959
The goblin caves are fun.

5753
04:40:38,959 --> 04:40:41,040
They are rigorous in some ways.

5754
04:40:41,040 --> 04:40:43,840
And then like you will get like shitty teleports.

5755
04:40:43,840 --> 04:40:46,880
So well, they just they made it better and they make it easier.

5756
04:40:46,880 --> 04:40:48,880
They kind of nerfed a lot of stuff in it, didn't they?

5757
04:40:48,880 --> 04:40:53,279
I think it's a lot more like predictable with the circles now.

5758
04:40:53,279 --> 04:40:54,080
So maybe.

5759
04:40:55,599 --> 04:40:59,599
But I just went into a couple earlier and they were still kind of weird.

5760
04:40:59,599 --> 04:41:00,159
Cool.

5761
04:41:00,159 --> 04:41:02,560
Well, that's good to know because I was like, oh, they made it.

5762
04:41:02,560 --> 04:41:03,360
They nerfed it.

5763
04:41:03,360 --> 04:41:07,020
Now I'm going to go in and be a dickhead and die.

5764
04:41:07,020 --> 04:41:08,779
Now, the the goblins still mess you up.

5765
04:41:08,779 --> 04:41:11,580
If you if you even take one hit, it's a quarter of the barb's health.

5766
04:41:11,580 --> 04:41:13,259
And he has the highest health.

5767
04:41:13,259 --> 04:41:14,139
So yeah.

5768
04:41:14,139 --> 04:41:17,819
Yeah, it's cool to have you on stream.

5769
04:41:17,819 --> 04:41:19,099
Thanks for playing.

5770
04:41:19,099 --> 04:41:21,180
I mean, I'm going to probably be playing for at least another couple of hours.

5771
04:41:21,180 --> 04:41:23,659
I don't know what the plan is, but I know Kraken's got another group.

5772
04:41:23,659 --> 04:41:25,500
I know there's other people playing, too.

5773
04:41:25,500 --> 04:41:27,080
Probably can jump around again later.

5774
04:41:27,080 --> 04:41:27,799
I'll be on.

5775
04:41:27,799 --> 04:41:29,549
I'll be playing Friday as well.

5776
04:41:29,549 --> 04:41:30,189
So sick.

5777
04:41:30,750 --> 04:41:32,110
Yeah, just let me know if you need me.

5778
04:41:32,110 --> 04:41:33,709
Yeah, it's awesome hanging out with you.

5779
04:41:33,709 --> 04:41:34,669
Thanks for coming out.

5780
04:41:34,669 --> 04:41:40,569
And make sure we get to follow the channel, everything, because you're good, too.

5781
04:41:40,569 --> 04:41:41,959
Appreciate that.

5782
04:41:41,959 --> 04:41:43,720
And I really appreciate going on.

5783
04:41:43,720 --> 04:41:45,880
And it was a good time.

5784
04:41:45,880 --> 04:41:51,880
Mods show that please spam Twitch.tv.

5785
04:41:54,119 --> 04:41:55,080
Slash.

5786
04:41:55,080 --> 04:41:59,049
You're too nice to me.

5787
04:41:59,049 --> 04:42:01,900
I really appreciate it.

5788
04:42:01,900 --> 04:42:02,380
Thank you.

5789
04:42:02,380 --> 04:42:04,000
Yeah, but take care.

5790
04:42:04,000 --> 04:42:04,479
We'll talk to you.

5791
04:42:04,479 --> 04:42:05,439
I'll talk to you soon.

5792
04:42:05,439 --> 04:42:11,040
Mods, mods, mods.

5793
04:42:11,919 --> 04:42:20,319
Yeah, I met him through when I went to go do the show with Charlie.

5794
04:42:20,319 --> 04:42:23,639
He's part of that kind of group.

5795
04:42:23,639 --> 04:42:27,500
They're all really cool, really funny, really awesome.

5796
04:42:27,500 --> 04:42:29,150
So cool to play with them.

5797
04:42:29,150 --> 04:42:34,639
Oh, there we go.

5798
04:42:34,639 --> 04:42:39,630
That's cool.

5799
04:42:39,630 --> 04:42:49,020
So I do want to try the new Goblin mode, at least for a little while.

5800
04:42:49,020 --> 04:42:50,380
I'm not bringing this yet.

5801
04:42:50,380 --> 04:42:57,979
This is staying right here until the last day.

5802
04:43:00,669 --> 04:43:02,919
But I'm just going in.

5803
04:43:02,919 --> 04:43:06,560
You know, I know Omega Lully's level 20 and he's like sucks.

5804
04:43:06,560 --> 04:43:07,040
Yeah, whatever.

5805
04:43:07,040 --> 04:43:07,680
Who cares?

5806
04:43:07,680 --> 04:43:09,819
It's just a play test.

5807
04:43:09,819 --> 04:43:11,099
I'll be better next play test.

5808
04:43:29,470 --> 04:43:32,569
No one's going to carry you now.

5809
04:43:32,569 --> 04:43:37,740
I feel like 70% of the runs we did were comedy runs.

5810
04:43:37,740 --> 04:43:42,459
So I think it worked out pretty well.

5811
04:43:42,459 --> 04:43:45,000
All right, let's go.

5812
04:43:45,000 --> 04:43:54,169
Awful place to start.

5813
04:43:54,169 --> 04:43:55,049
But whatever.

5814
04:43:55,049 --> 04:44:03,610
Oh, that's oh, this is also not good.

5815
04:44:03,610 --> 04:44:07,740
This is also bad.

5816
04:44:09,470 --> 04:44:10,189
This is awful.

5817
04:44:12,799 --> 04:44:15,360
I am so glad I didn't bring this reander down here.

5818
04:44:15,360 --> 04:44:25,000
I think I made it up.

5819
04:44:25,000 --> 04:44:25,880
Oh, he swung.

5820
04:44:26,680 --> 04:44:28,360
Close, close, close it.

5821
04:44:28,360 --> 04:44:30,650
This room is equally as bad.

5822
04:44:30,650 --> 04:44:38,560
Oh, my God.

5823
04:44:38,560 --> 04:44:55,520
OK, come on, come on.

5824
04:44:55,520 --> 04:44:56,799
I bumped into the wall.

5825
04:44:56,799 --> 04:45:01,130
Well, this is a bad start.

5826
04:45:01,130 --> 04:45:02,490
Maybe I'll find some heals.

5827
04:45:02,490 --> 04:45:17,560
Pretty good.

5828
04:45:17,560 --> 04:45:24,599
Better than pull you over here.

5829
04:45:24,599 --> 04:45:26,040
This time don't get hit.

5830
04:45:26,040 --> 04:45:32,909
I don't want to aggro the rest of the room.

5831
04:45:32,909 --> 04:45:34,029
Come on, get over here.

5832
04:45:34,029 --> 04:45:56,830
Get over here.

5833
04:45:56,830 --> 04:45:58,590
Hey, would you look at that?

5834
04:45:58,590 --> 04:45:59,310
30.

5835
04:45:59,310 --> 04:46:02,009
Look, I asked and God answered.

5836
04:46:02,009 --> 04:46:16,939
23.

5837
04:46:18,060 --> 04:46:20,139
I don't really know how to use this, but I'll try it.

5838
04:46:20,139 --> 04:46:22,270
This thing is like a head bopper, right?

5839
04:46:22,270 --> 04:46:22,750
Yeah.

5840
04:46:22,750 --> 04:46:53,959
Anything else?

5841
04:46:53,959 --> 04:46:55,799
For some reason, I thought that was a guy in there.

5842
04:46:55,799 --> 04:47:05,849
I saw like just the shoes.

5843
04:47:05,849 --> 04:47:20,590
This stir stream is still on.

5844
04:47:20,590 --> 04:47:21,389
It is.

5845
04:47:21,389 --> 04:47:35,849
Hold on.

5846
04:47:35,849 --> 04:47:37,209
We're not like messing around, right?

5847
04:47:37,209 --> 04:47:53,259
Is it actually just still on?

5848
04:47:53,259 --> 04:47:54,700
Oh, that's one of these things.

5849
04:47:54,700 --> 04:48:09,040
Hold on.

5850
04:48:10,000 --> 04:48:13,720
I'm just kind of walking and dying, but I actually don't want.

5851
04:48:13,720 --> 04:48:16,040
If he doesn't know that, then I definitely want to make sure he knows.

5852
04:48:35,799 --> 04:48:36,360
Give me one second.

5853
04:48:36,919 --> 04:48:37,720
I'm going to text him.

5854
04:48:37,720 --> 04:48:42,939
I would definitely want someone to tell me if I did that.

5855
04:48:42,939 --> 04:48:44,880
Give me one second.

5856
04:48:44,880 --> 04:48:53,549
I'll be right back.

5857
04:48:53,549 --> 04:48:55,419
Concerned, Andy?

5858
04:48:55,419 --> 04:48:58,619
No, but I mean, if you don't know that's happening, it's just like, oh, wait, what?

5859
04:48:58,619 --> 04:48:59,869
Give me one second.

5860
04:48:59,869 --> 04:52:25,740
I'll be right back.

5861
04:52:25,740 --> 04:52:26,860
Okay, just give me two more seconds.

5862
04:52:26,860 --> 04:52:28,799
Two seconds.

5863
04:52:28,799 --> 04:52:30,080
I just saw the subs come in.

5864
04:52:30,080 --> 04:52:34,220
Yeah, dude, I appreciate that.

5865
04:52:34,220 --> 04:52:37,400
We should be giving subs to you, though.

5866
04:52:38,400 --> 04:52:39,599
Not this way.

5867
04:52:39,599 --> 04:52:42,330
No, it was a blast having you on.

5868
04:52:42,330 --> 04:52:51,259
Give me two more seconds.

5869
04:52:51,259 --> 04:52:53,419
Sometimes Twitch staff hangs out here.

5870
04:52:53,419 --> 04:52:55,919
I don't know if anybody from Twitch staff is aware of this.

5871
04:52:55,919 --> 04:52:57,200
Maybe they can do something about it.

5872
04:52:57,200 --> 04:53:00,169
I don't know.

5873
04:53:00,169 --> 04:53:09,240
Sometimes there's staff that lurks here.

5874
04:53:09,240 --> 04:53:11,080
Give me one more moment.

5875
04:53:11,080 --> 04:53:13,450
Don't worry, I'm going to be live for a while.

5876
04:53:13,450 --> 04:55:13,159
Don't worry.

5877
04:55:13,159 --> 04:55:22,430
Uh, I'm going to just keep playing.

5878
04:55:22,430 --> 04:55:24,189
Hey, look, Twitch staff.

5879
04:55:24,189 --> 04:55:27,470
Staff?

5880
04:55:28,029 --> 04:55:33,950
Staff.

5881
04:55:33,950 --> 04:55:39,529
Yeah, we think that Stirr may have left his stream on.

5882
04:55:39,529 --> 04:55:40,330
Possibly.

5883
04:55:40,330 --> 04:55:50,889
I think he did a raid and then I think just didn't turn the stream on.

5884
04:55:50,889 --> 04:56:00,700
The worms got him.

5885
04:56:13,790 --> 04:56:15,869
He fell asleep instantly.

5886
04:56:18,360 --> 04:56:21,319
I mean, he did leave very quickly.

5887
04:56:21,319 --> 04:56:22,759
It was like, yeah, yeah, okay, bye.

5888
04:56:25,740 --> 04:56:26,700
Oh, he's back.

5889
04:56:26,700 --> 04:56:27,340
All right.

5890
04:56:27,340 --> 04:56:29,259
Stirr came back.

5891
04:56:29,259 --> 04:56:39,880
Okay.

5892
04:56:39,880 --> 04:56:40,360
All right.

5893
04:56:40,360 --> 04:56:41,159
We good?

5894
04:56:41,159 --> 04:56:42,189
We're good.

5895
04:56:42,189 --> 04:56:42,509
We're good.

5896
04:56:42,509 --> 04:56:54,520
We're good.

5897
04:56:54,520 --> 04:56:55,000
All right.

5898
04:56:55,000 --> 04:56:55,720
We're good.

5899
04:56:55,720 --> 04:56:58,860
He said, huh?

5900
04:56:58,860 --> 04:57:09,560
Bro, he's going to go another 12 hours.

5901
04:57:09,560 --> 04:57:14,400
He put food in the oven and took a shower.

5902
04:57:14,400 --> 04:57:18,349
Yeah, I tried texting him.

5903
04:57:18,349 --> 04:57:24,439
We pinged him a few times and, you know, I think we even pinged Ashley a few times too.

5904
04:57:24,439 --> 04:57:27,229
All right.

5905
04:57:27,229 --> 04:57:28,110
Well, that's good.

5906
04:57:28,110 --> 04:57:28,990
Situated.

5907
04:57:28,990 --> 04:57:36,959
My text didn't even go through to him.

5908
04:57:36,959 --> 04:57:40,400
Hold on.

5909
04:57:40,400 --> 04:57:42,959
Wait, did he mean to do that and he was coming back?

5910
04:57:42,959 --> 04:57:44,569
No, I doubt it.

5911
04:57:44,569 --> 04:57:49,479
He got your Discord things.

5912
04:57:49,479 --> 04:57:50,360
Okay, good.

5913
04:57:50,360 --> 04:57:54,560
No, dude, he has your number blocked.

5914
04:57:56,159 --> 04:58:02,119
All right.

5915
04:58:02,680 --> 04:58:03,639
All right, that's good.

5916
04:58:03,639 --> 04:58:14,540
Oh, my text says not delivered.

5917
04:58:14,540 --> 04:58:15,919
Oh, that's weird.

5918
04:58:15,919 --> 04:58:16,750
Okay.

5919
04:58:16,750 --> 04:58:19,020
Well, we're good.

5920
04:58:19,020 --> 04:58:39,049
Okay, he's ending for real now.

5921
04:58:39,049 --> 04:58:39,849
All right, good.

5922
04:58:39,849 --> 04:58:49,689
Yeah, trust me when I say I would want someone to do that for me too.

5923
04:58:49,689 --> 04:58:55,259
If I just like left the stream on for like, yeah, it's like, hey, hey, hey, turn it off.

5924
04:58:55,259 --> 04:58:59,130
Because you never know.

5925
04:58:59,130 --> 04:59:01,049
Honestly, here's a little tip.

5926
04:59:01,049 --> 04:59:03,880
You just kind of don't know, right?

5927
04:59:04,279 --> 04:59:07,099
If you're setting a stream up, then trust me, I've been doing this before.

5928
04:59:07,099 --> 04:59:11,689
Like, showing up hours later and you put, I don't know how many times I've probably

5929
04:59:11,689 --> 04:59:12,970
sat here and fucking farted.

5930
04:59:12,970 --> 04:59:14,750
You know what I mean?

5931
04:59:14,750 --> 04:59:17,310
Or like just, oh, I have no clothes on.

5932
04:59:17,310 --> 04:59:19,369
I'm just kind of walking around in my room.

5933
04:59:19,369 --> 04:59:20,889
You know what I mean?

5934
04:59:20,889 --> 04:59:22,250
You just need to fucking know these things.

5935
04:59:22,250 --> 04:59:27,369
You just need to know.

5936
04:59:27,369 --> 04:59:28,250
You've got to know.

5937
04:59:37,040 --> 04:59:42,750
What the hell?

5938
04:59:42,750 --> 04:59:46,139
I'm staying in here.

5939
04:59:46,139 --> 05:00:00,459
How is, I can't fight these?

5940
05:00:00,459 --> 05:00:05,580
I have to pull them all individually into the room.

5941
05:00:05,580 --> 05:00:16,009
Why did you come too?

5942
05:00:16,009 --> 05:00:17,209
Oh, my God.

5943
05:00:17,209 --> 05:00:19,740
Are we sure?

5944
05:00:19,740 --> 05:00:19,979
Hold on.

5945
05:00:19,979 --> 05:00:22,779
Are we sure they didn't add enemies and damage?

5946
05:00:27,500 --> 05:00:30,840
Wait, what is he screaming in his house?

5947
05:00:30,840 --> 05:00:31,799
What are you talking about?

5948
05:00:46,680 --> 05:00:48,919
Is it like, he's doing like a bit?

5949
05:00:48,919 --> 05:00:57,020
I think a bat got into his house.

5950
05:00:57,020 --> 05:01:01,209
All right.

5951
05:01:01,209 --> 05:01:02,490
Give me a better spawn.

5952
05:01:06,569 --> 05:01:07,849
Hold on a second.

5953
05:01:07,849 --> 05:01:20,619
The channel's still live.

5954
05:01:37,950 --> 05:01:38,590
Oh, he hurt.

5955
05:01:38,590 --> 05:01:39,150
He hurt.

5956
05:01:39,150 --> 05:01:39,709
Fuck.

5957
05:01:39,709 --> 05:01:40,590
Yeah, I did.

5958
05:01:40,590 --> 05:01:40,990
I did.

5959
05:01:41,709 --> 05:01:43,229
That was pretty sly.

5960
05:01:43,229 --> 05:01:44,119
Pretty sly.

5961
05:01:49,689 --> 05:01:55,450
I thought he was like in danger.

5962
05:01:55,450 --> 05:01:57,290
And it's so funny during that whole thing.

5963
05:01:57,290 --> 05:02:00,330
Somebody in chat definitely wrote, oh my God, he's so bad at the game.

5964
05:02:12,439 --> 05:02:17,919
Dude, this guy sucks at this.

5965
05:02:17,919 --> 05:02:26,380
Click.

5966
05:02:26,380 --> 05:02:27,529
Fuck.

5967
05:02:27,529 --> 05:02:27,849
I clicked.

5968
05:02:27,849 --> 05:02:29,639
You heard it like five times.

5969
05:02:29,639 --> 05:02:30,040
All right.

5970
05:02:30,040 --> 05:02:38,169
I didn't get spawned into a terrible spot.

5971
05:02:38,169 --> 05:02:38,970
New hat.

5972
05:02:38,970 --> 05:02:41,520
This is actually really good.

5973
05:02:41,520 --> 05:02:47,319
Plus any stats is very good.

5974
05:02:47,319 --> 05:02:48,889
Okay.

5975
05:02:48,889 --> 05:02:51,209
I actually don't want to die because that helmet is very good.

5976
05:02:56,409 --> 05:03:07,610
It's better.

5977
05:03:07,610 --> 05:03:09,049
I don't think I've ever used this.

5978
05:03:09,049 --> 05:03:18,720
I just, should I do a wield?

5979
05:03:18,720 --> 05:03:31,360
Why not?

5980
05:03:31,360 --> 05:03:31,599
Click.

5981
05:03:39,099 --> 05:03:43,680
Pretty nice.

5982
05:03:43,680 --> 05:03:47,130
Okay.

5983
05:03:47,130 --> 05:03:47,689
Ooh.

5984
05:03:47,689 --> 05:03:49,689
Okay.

5985
05:03:49,689 --> 05:03:50,810
Oh, shit.

5986
05:03:50,810 --> 05:03:54,880
25 or 20.

5987
05:03:54,880 --> 05:03:56,720
That's plus two agility.

5988
05:03:56,720 --> 05:04:02,409
Oh my God.

5989
05:04:02,409 --> 05:04:04,619
I'm looking how fast I move now.

5990
05:04:04,619 --> 05:04:05,020
Jesus.

5991
05:04:05,020 --> 05:04:05,580
All right.

5992
05:04:05,580 --> 05:04:06,799
Let's keep that on.

5993
05:04:06,799 --> 05:04:25,740
I thought there was a player.

5994
05:04:25,740 --> 05:04:26,700
Beat saber mode.

5995
05:04:27,259 --> 05:04:27,900
Yeah, that's true.

5996
05:04:29,360 --> 05:04:30,319
Actually true.

5997
05:04:30,319 --> 05:04:40,959
This is the loot corner.

5998
05:04:40,959 --> 05:04:42,880
So much shit on these walls here.

5999
05:04:50,200 --> 05:04:50,840
Uh-oh.

6000
05:04:50,840 --> 05:04:58,860
He's above me.

6001
05:04:58,860 --> 05:05:21,819
But holy shit.

6002
05:05:21,819 --> 05:05:23,180
That's a pretty, I got to get out of here now.

6003
05:05:23,180 --> 05:05:36,939
That's a, that's a diamond.

6004
05:05:36,939 --> 05:05:40,169
I run fast now.

6005
05:05:40,169 --> 05:05:40,569
Geez.

6006
05:05:42,779 --> 05:05:46,009
All right.

6007
05:05:46,009 --> 05:05:47,209
Don't fuck this up.

6008
05:05:47,209 --> 05:05:50,319
I was going to find a way out because I want to keep, that's it.

6009
05:05:50,319 --> 05:05:51,680
That was a cool diamond.

6010
05:05:51,680 --> 05:05:58,200
Come on down, please.

6011
05:05:58,200 --> 05:05:59,639
Are you all the way up in the ceiling?

6012
05:06:06,779 --> 05:06:07,099
What?

6013
05:06:08,430 --> 05:06:09,389
Oh, you're full of shit.

6014
05:06:12,459 --> 05:06:13,180
Oh my God.

6015
05:06:13,180 --> 05:06:13,979
Just fucking run.

6016
05:06:15,020 --> 05:06:15,340
What?

6017
05:06:15,340 --> 05:06:17,340
This is, that enemy is so fucking weird.

6018
05:06:17,340 --> 05:06:18,060
I swear to God.

6019
05:06:18,700 --> 05:06:29,159
The thing is a glued to the ceiling and then comes down and goes,

6020
05:06:29,159 --> 05:06:31,000
dee, dee, dee.

6021
05:06:31,000 --> 05:06:38,090
What have you done?

6022
05:06:38,090 --> 05:06:39,450
Why did you bring all this shit down here?

6023
05:06:43,529 --> 05:06:45,630
Fucking stuck in the wall.

6024
05:06:48,439 --> 05:06:49,560
What the fuck, dude?

6025
05:06:49,560 --> 05:06:50,759
I literally couldn't even move.

6026
05:06:52,540 --> 05:06:54,139
I was literally stuck.

6027
05:06:54,139 --> 05:06:58,169
I couldn't walk.

6028
05:06:58,169 --> 05:07:01,319
Fuck that bug.

6029
05:07:01,319 --> 05:07:02,360
I was fine too.

6030
05:07:11,419 --> 05:07:12,139
Pain in the ass.

6031
05:07:29,959 --> 05:07:32,540
Good night, Irene.

6032
05:07:32,540 --> 05:07:33,659
I jumped into it.

6033
05:07:33,659 --> 05:07:46,569
At least you're not losing stuff.

6034
05:07:46,569 --> 05:07:49,740
The thing, well, he kind of just said he had the same idea

6035
05:07:49,740 --> 05:07:50,619
where he was just like, you know what?

6036
05:07:50,619 --> 05:07:51,340
We're just dead.

6037
05:07:51,340 --> 05:07:52,540
So one of us is going to die.

6038
05:07:53,259 --> 05:07:53,819
You know what?

6039
05:07:53,819 --> 05:07:54,939
I would have rather he killed me.

6040
05:07:55,680 --> 05:07:58,560
He knew too that one of us was going to get embarrassed

6041
05:07:58,560 --> 05:07:59,759
getting stuck in that corner.

6042
05:07:59,759 --> 05:08:00,880
And he didn't want it to be him.

6043
05:08:00,880 --> 05:08:03,080
So he got the easy way out.

6044
05:08:09,419 --> 05:08:10,540
You married into it.

6045
05:08:10,540 --> 05:08:49,209
It is sore though.

6046
05:08:49,209 --> 05:08:49,529
Okay.

6047
05:08:53,680 --> 05:08:56,400
Somebody asked, why do the skeletons have blood?

6048
05:08:56,400 --> 05:08:57,279
Bone marrow.

6049
05:08:57,279 --> 05:08:58,400
You know where your blood comes from?

6050
05:09:14,830 --> 05:09:19,549
Bone marrow.

6051
05:09:19,549 --> 05:09:22,270
I feel like this is going to be a never-ending spider thing

6052
05:09:22,270 --> 05:09:27,419
because my weapon is not.

6053
05:09:27,419 --> 05:09:28,779
You're still living.

6054
05:09:28,779 --> 05:09:30,459
Why are you still among the living?

6055
05:09:30,459 --> 05:09:30,779
All right.

6056
05:09:30,779 --> 05:09:31,979
Just don't go that way.

6057
05:09:31,979 --> 05:09:36,729
Your blood comes from your heart.

6058
05:09:41,919 --> 05:09:49,049
Your, what are you talking about?

6059
05:09:49,049 --> 05:09:52,279
Your heart pumps it.

6060
05:10:00,200 --> 05:10:01,400
It actually comes from marrow.

6061
05:10:11,759 --> 05:10:13,759
Blood cells are made in the bone marrow.

6062
05:10:13,759 --> 05:10:15,599
The bone marrow is the soft spongy material

6063
05:10:15,599 --> 05:10:16,720
in the center of the bones.

6064
05:10:16,720 --> 05:10:19,770
It produces about 95% of the body's blood cells.

6065
05:10:19,770 --> 05:10:22,490
Most of the adult body's bone marrow is in the pelvic bones.

6066
05:10:22,490 --> 05:10:24,830
Breast bone and the bones of the spine.

6067
05:10:24,830 --> 05:10:26,189
Time that person out for 10 minutes.

6068
05:10:26,189 --> 05:10:55,080
Somebody's coming over that way.

6069
05:10:55,080 --> 05:10:57,770
This is going to get bad, isn't it?

6070
05:11:00,639 --> 05:11:02,810
He hears all this, too.

6071
05:11:02,810 --> 05:11:04,169
He's probably listening to the door.

6072
05:11:12,779 --> 05:11:13,099
Yeah.

6073
05:11:18,220 --> 05:11:19,020
Are we cool?

6074
05:11:19,020 --> 05:11:32,400
All right, you're cool.

6075
05:11:32,400 --> 05:11:47,840
I'm not going to kill you.

6076
05:11:47,840 --> 05:11:49,319
I'm just following you.

6077
05:11:49,319 --> 05:12:04,279
That sounds weird, but pretend to be fighting me.

6078
05:12:04,279 --> 05:12:05,319
Pretend to be fighting me.

6079
05:12:05,319 --> 05:12:09,930
Get back here.

6080
05:12:09,930 --> 05:12:13,520
Yeah, pretend to be fighting me so we can trick somebody.

6081
05:12:17,209 --> 05:12:19,150
Don't even think about it.

6082
05:12:19,709 --> 05:12:20,669
Oh, no.

6083
05:12:20,669 --> 05:12:22,729
Uh-oh.

6084
05:12:22,729 --> 05:12:28,759
Ooh, it didn't work.

6085
05:12:28,759 --> 05:12:29,799
I thought someone was coming through the door.

6086
05:12:33,130 --> 05:12:37,000
And then get him.

6087
05:12:37,000 --> 05:12:39,209
Well, that was fun for a minute.

6088
05:12:39,209 --> 05:12:40,409
We have to be in this room.

6089
05:12:40,409 --> 05:12:41,209
This is awful.

6090
05:12:43,919 --> 05:12:44,880
I'm going to go around.

6091
05:12:44,880 --> 05:12:46,240
I don't want to deal with that side.

6092
05:12:46,319 --> 05:12:48,560
I don't have any items.

6093
05:12:48,560 --> 05:12:49,520
What the fuck have I been doing?

6094
05:13:37,869 --> 05:13:38,270
All right.

6095
05:13:38,270 --> 05:13:39,229
I just need to find a portal.

6096
05:13:39,229 --> 05:13:40,669
I really didn't do anything this round.

6097
05:13:40,669 --> 05:13:42,349
I kind of just walked around in a circle.

6098
05:13:42,349 --> 05:13:46,040
So many concentrated enemies right there.

6099
05:13:46,040 --> 05:13:52,520
I need to at least get some loot or something.

6100
05:13:52,520 --> 05:13:54,439
There are so many people that are left, too.

6101
05:13:54,439 --> 05:14:09,229
Still aggro'd on him.

6102
05:14:13,310 --> 05:14:14,029
Nice one.

6103
05:14:14,029 --> 05:14:23,400
Oh, shit.

6104
05:14:38,430 --> 05:14:39,069
All right.

6105
05:14:39,069 --> 05:14:40,560
Nice job.

6106
05:14:40,560 --> 05:14:52,830
All right.

6107
05:14:52,830 --> 05:14:53,310
We got to...

6108
05:14:53,310 --> 05:14:54,430
I mean, we don't have to get to...

6109
05:14:54,430 --> 05:14:56,650
Ooh.

6110
05:14:56,650 --> 05:14:57,979
All right.

6111
05:14:57,979 --> 05:14:58,939
What do we got?

6112
05:14:58,939 --> 05:15:01,279
Something good?

6113
05:15:17,630 --> 05:15:20,430
May your journeys be long, your ale fresh,

6114
05:15:21,069 --> 05:15:24,509
and your carrots crunchy, and your stew hot,

6115
05:15:24,509 --> 05:15:30,560
and your goblins easy to slay, and your friends plentiful.

6116
05:15:30,560 --> 05:15:30,880
All right.

6117
05:15:30,880 --> 05:15:31,439
You go.

6118
05:15:31,439 --> 05:15:33,849
You go.

6119
05:15:33,849 --> 05:15:34,970
I have nothing.

6120
05:15:34,970 --> 05:15:36,409
I have literally have no reason to go through that.

6121
05:15:45,340 --> 05:15:46,700
Like, I really just don't.

6122
05:15:46,700 --> 05:15:48,540
I mean, 10 gold maybe.

6123
05:15:48,540 --> 05:15:55,959
There's a lot of people left for how tiny this circle is.

6124
05:15:55,959 --> 05:16:09,099
I'm the last one.

6125
05:16:09,880 --> 05:16:14,360
Oh, no, I'm not.

6126
05:16:14,360 --> 05:16:15,880
There's like three people left.

6127
05:16:15,880 --> 05:16:28,319
I just wanted a portal.

6128
05:16:28,319 --> 05:16:29,630
Oh, wait.

6129
05:16:29,630 --> 05:16:30,349
I heard one.

6130
05:16:30,349 --> 05:16:37,529
I think it was above, though.

6131
05:16:37,529 --> 05:16:38,569
Yeah, it was above.

6132
05:16:38,569 --> 05:16:40,959
That's OK.

6133
05:16:40,959 --> 05:16:42,639
Yeah, I should have just dropped all my shit,

6134
05:16:42,639 --> 05:16:54,959
and he could have just taken it.

6135
05:16:54,959 --> 05:16:55,840
The next adventurer.

6136
05:17:14,990 --> 05:17:17,419
You can make it if you run.

6137
05:17:19,259 --> 05:17:21,520
If there was something good in that treasure chest,

6138
05:17:21,520 --> 05:17:34,729
then I'm glad somebody got it.

6139
05:17:34,729 --> 05:17:38,250
My last message from Stirr, like 15 minutes ago,

6140
05:17:38,250 --> 05:17:40,330
kind of disrespectful to ask me to end stream.

6141
05:17:40,330 --> 05:17:41,209
It wasn't even bad.

6142
05:17:41,849 --> 05:17:44,669
Hello?

6143
05:17:58,220 --> 05:18:09,680
Well, he's such a shit.

6144
05:18:09,680 --> 05:18:10,560
Oh, hi.

6145
05:18:10,560 --> 05:18:11,439
10 enemies.

6146
05:18:11,439 --> 05:18:35,790
There really are so many.

6147
05:18:35,790 --> 05:18:50,110
You weren't even close.

6148
05:18:50,110 --> 05:18:52,810
That's a pretty decent amount of money to start with.

6149
05:18:55,099 --> 05:18:56,939
I'm going to try to just get out of here.

6150
05:18:56,939 --> 05:19:18,240
Oh, a diamond.

6151
05:19:18,240 --> 05:19:20,970
OK.

6152
05:19:20,970 --> 05:19:24,889
Oh, if only I had somebody to guide me.

6153
05:19:24,889 --> 05:19:29,240
If only somebody was around to show me the way.

6154
05:19:30,189 --> 05:19:39,150
Oh, oh, stuck down here in a dungeon.

6155
05:19:39,150 --> 05:19:41,869
If only there was an adventurer that could help me.

6156
05:19:46,430 --> 05:19:49,130
The promise of jewels was not enough.

6157
05:19:50,939 --> 05:19:54,490
Oh, if only there was an adventurer that could come

6158
05:19:54,490 --> 05:19:56,490
and help me and accept my quest.

6159
05:20:02,360 --> 05:20:17,500
Oh, thank you for accepting my quest.

6160
05:20:18,319 --> 05:20:20,400
Oh, it's been very cold down here.

6161
05:20:22,110 --> 05:20:22,909
Where are you?

6162
05:20:22,909 --> 05:20:23,709
Where are you off to?

6163
05:20:24,990 --> 05:20:25,950
Oh, if only there.

6164
05:20:25,950 --> 05:20:26,349
All right.

6165
05:20:26,349 --> 05:20:26,990
We need to.

6166
05:20:26,990 --> 05:20:27,950
There's too many people.

6167
05:20:30,990 --> 05:20:37,819
Oh, dear.

6168
05:20:37,819 --> 05:20:40,060
The dungeon is so strong, brothers.

6169
05:20:40,060 --> 05:20:41,500
So dark down here.

6170
05:20:42,650 --> 05:20:45,709
If anyone were to lead me to a portal,

6171
05:20:45,709 --> 05:20:49,470
I have a diamond that they will have if they complete my quest.

6172
05:20:50,509 --> 05:20:52,909
I look in the door this way.

6173
05:20:52,909 --> 05:20:57,580
Hurry hurrying behind you.

6174
05:21:05,919 --> 05:21:06,720
Is that acid?

6175
05:21:07,610 --> 05:21:08,330
No, it's safe.

6176
05:21:08,330 --> 05:21:08,810
It is safe.

6177
05:21:09,529 --> 05:21:11,529
See, it's green jello.

6178
05:21:17,360 --> 05:21:18,560
So much mountain dew.

6179
05:21:22,090 --> 05:21:22,729
All right.

6180
05:21:22,729 --> 05:21:23,369
All right.

6181
05:21:23,369 --> 05:21:23,849
All right.

6182
05:21:24,569 --> 05:21:27,930
Oh, the poison, the poison stings.

6183
05:21:27,930 --> 05:21:30,569
Does anyone have a close the door behind us?

6184
05:21:32,009 --> 05:21:33,450
We're fucking dead.

6185
05:21:34,009 --> 05:21:35,369
There's no way we're getting through this.

6186
05:21:36,009 --> 05:21:36,810
Oh, my God.

6187
05:21:36,810 --> 05:21:37,610
That's so slow.

6188
05:21:39,840 --> 05:21:40,400
Oh, shit.

6189
05:21:40,400 --> 05:21:41,279
I almost closed the door.

6190
05:21:44,520 --> 05:21:46,360
Would any of you happen to have a healing pot?

6191
05:21:46,360 --> 05:21:47,560
Watch out behind you.

6192
05:21:47,560 --> 05:21:52,220
There's a mummy and a bug and a snake.

6193
05:22:00,700 --> 05:22:04,220
Please, if you get it out alive, I have a diamond on me.

6194
05:22:04,220 --> 05:22:05,020
Even though you failed.

6195
05:22:10,909 --> 05:22:12,029
There's so many things.

6196
05:22:13,229 --> 05:22:17,799
We were just being followed by 25 enemies.

6197
05:22:17,799 --> 05:22:28,860
I want to be an escort quest for somebody so bad.

6198
05:22:28,860 --> 05:22:31,259
Oh, I would be willing to give anybody all of my items

6199
05:22:31,259 --> 05:22:33,180
that they would escort me to a portal.

6200
05:22:33,180 --> 05:22:34,700
Find me.

6201
05:22:34,700 --> 05:22:35,659
Find me if you could.

6202
05:22:36,220 --> 05:22:38,439
Okay.

6203
05:22:38,439 --> 05:22:39,479
You're mean.

6204
05:22:39,479 --> 05:22:54,560
Okay.

6205
05:22:54,560 --> 05:22:56,560
I need to find like a blue diamond

6206
05:22:56,560 --> 05:22:58,720
and then just be a quest for somebody.

6207
05:22:58,720 --> 05:23:00,270
I'm into that right now.

6208
05:23:00,270 --> 05:23:05,000
I'm down on the southern end of the map.

6209
05:23:05,000 --> 05:23:08,319
I don't know how far my voice travels.

6210
05:23:33,020 --> 05:23:35,900
Next time, I'm just going to bring like 15 bandages

6211
05:23:35,900 --> 05:23:39,560
and like 25 potions in the corner.

6212
05:23:40,750 --> 05:23:41,709
Oh, my goodness.

6213
05:23:41,709 --> 05:23:42,669
These fucking enemies.

6214
05:23:44,830 --> 05:23:45,389
Jesus.

6215
05:23:46,270 --> 05:24:00,509
There we go.

6216
05:24:00,509 --> 05:24:02,560
A magical amulet.

6217
05:24:03,200 --> 05:24:14,779
Oh, my God.

6218
05:24:14,779 --> 05:24:15,819
There's so much gear over here.

6219
05:24:15,819 --> 05:24:16,299
I can do it.

6220
05:24:17,099 --> 05:24:17,979
Just don't die.

6221
05:24:17,979 --> 05:24:19,180
Look at all this shit over here.

6222
05:24:19,180 --> 05:24:25,119
What are you doing?

6223
05:24:25,119 --> 05:24:27,290
What the hell is this person?

6224
05:24:27,290 --> 05:24:27,849
What are you doing?

6225
05:24:28,860 --> 05:24:30,380
What were you doing?

6226
05:24:30,380 --> 05:24:34,380
Look at all these.

6227
05:24:34,380 --> 05:24:35,099
Oh, my God.

6228
05:24:35,099 --> 05:24:36,779
This is such a quest reward.

6229
05:24:36,779 --> 05:24:47,599
I need an adventurer to help me get out of the dungeon.

6230
05:24:48,799 --> 05:24:49,520
I have gold.

6231
05:24:50,080 --> 05:24:52,220
I have trinkets.

6232
05:24:53,819 --> 05:24:55,659
I need some help to get out of the dungeon.

6233
05:24:55,659 --> 05:24:57,180
I have plenty of goods.

6234
05:24:58,939 --> 05:25:00,299
Is there anyone out there?

6235
05:25:00,299 --> 05:25:08,319
Can anybody hear me?

6236
05:25:08,319 --> 05:25:10,000
I need an escort out of the dungeon.

6237
05:25:16,860 --> 05:25:17,340
Anyone?

6238
05:25:18,330 --> 05:25:19,849
Can anyone hear me?

6239
05:25:19,849 --> 05:25:27,319
I need an escort out of the dungeon, please.

6240
05:25:27,959 --> 05:25:30,139
I have gold.

6241
05:25:33,560 --> 05:25:34,680
I have treasure.

6242
05:25:34,680 --> 05:25:49,389
If anyone's out there, I have gold.

6243
05:25:49,389 --> 05:25:50,590
I have jewels.

6244
05:25:50,590 --> 05:25:54,430
I need an escort out of the dungeon, please.

6245
05:26:02,430 --> 05:26:04,169
Fuck these bugs.

6246
05:26:04,169 --> 05:26:05,290
They're the worst.

6247
05:26:05,290 --> 05:26:20,000
I'm on the lower level.

6248
05:26:20,000 --> 05:26:32,479
There's no one here to help me.

6249
05:26:32,479 --> 05:26:46,680
Is there anyone that will help me?

6250
05:26:46,680 --> 05:26:52,669
Adventurer, adventurer, I need help.

6251
05:26:52,669 --> 05:26:55,229
Oh, there's a lot of fucking spiders here.

6252
05:26:57,759 --> 05:27:02,840
Oh, adventurer.

6253
05:27:02,840 --> 05:27:03,240
If you...

6254
05:27:03,240 --> 05:27:04,279
That's a fucking enemy.

6255
05:27:05,419 --> 05:27:22,110
I just saw the shield.

6256
05:27:22,110 --> 05:27:22,669
All right, we're going...

6257
05:27:22,669 --> 05:27:28,159
We're doing a real one this time.

6258
05:27:28,159 --> 05:27:29,840
Well, howdy there.

6259
05:27:29,840 --> 05:27:31,720
I need an escort out of the dungeon.

6260
05:27:31,720 --> 05:27:33,159
I will pay gold and jewels.

6261
05:27:33,159 --> 05:27:34,119
If you can please find me,

6262
05:27:34,119 --> 05:27:35,880
I will go to the southern end of the map.

6263
05:27:35,880 --> 05:27:37,790
Please, please.

6264
05:27:37,790 --> 05:27:38,669
Okay.

6265
05:27:38,669 --> 05:27:42,700
That was such a reluctant okay.

6266
05:27:42,700 --> 05:27:44,380
That was the most reluctant okay I've ever heard.

6267
05:27:45,770 --> 05:27:46,250
That was like...

6268
05:27:51,439 --> 05:27:53,119
I'm going to die on my way over there.

6269
05:27:53,119 --> 05:27:55,959
I hope he finds my body.

6270
05:27:55,959 --> 05:27:59,950
Quest accepted.

6271
05:27:59,950 --> 05:28:02,060
All right, I got to get to the southern end of the map.

6272
05:28:07,450 --> 05:28:07,770
Please.

6273
05:28:08,639 --> 05:28:09,520
Look at that.

6274
05:28:09,520 --> 05:28:10,639
Oh, I can't believe it.

6275
05:28:10,639 --> 05:28:11,919
I found you pretty fast.

6276
05:28:11,919 --> 05:28:14,970
Will you accept my quest?

6277
05:28:14,970 --> 05:28:15,369
Sure.

6278
05:28:15,930 --> 05:28:16,569
Okay.

6279
05:28:16,569 --> 05:28:18,250
I don't know very much about the dungeon.

6280
05:28:18,250 --> 05:28:21,450
All I know is that I don't want to be down here.

6281
05:28:21,450 --> 05:28:23,069
It smells.

6282
05:28:23,069 --> 05:28:24,509
Yeah, yeah, that's fair.

6283
05:28:24,509 --> 05:28:27,639
I see you're a wizard.

6284
05:28:28,830 --> 05:28:29,470
Very helpful.

6285
05:28:30,189 --> 05:28:30,689
Claire.

6286
05:28:31,389 --> 05:28:32,590
Oh, yeah.

6287
05:28:35,549 --> 05:28:36,029
Careful.

6288
05:28:36,669 --> 05:28:38,520
This dungeon is known to have all kinds...

6289
05:28:38,520 --> 05:28:39,639
Adventurer!

6290
05:28:39,639 --> 05:28:40,520
There are goblins!

6291
05:28:41,659 --> 05:28:42,220
Adventurer!

6292
05:28:42,939 --> 05:28:48,330
I'm back, I'm back.

6293
05:28:48,330 --> 05:28:48,889
Careful.

6294
05:28:49,610 --> 05:28:52,040
With the great power of

6295
05:28:52,840 --> 05:28:54,520
Phineas Davidson.

6296
05:28:54,520 --> 05:28:55,319
I smacked you.

6297
05:28:59,720 --> 05:29:00,599
Oh my goodness.

6298
05:29:04,540 --> 05:29:05,020
Behind you.

6299
05:29:05,819 --> 05:29:11,080
Look out!

6300
05:29:11,639 --> 05:29:18,380
Not swinging.

6301
05:29:30,330 --> 05:29:33,689
These caves have so many scary things in them.

6302
05:29:34,970 --> 05:29:39,680
When I was younger, I used to explore here.

6303
05:29:39,680 --> 05:29:45,919
Onward!

6304
05:29:45,919 --> 05:29:47,200
Well, that way seems dangerous.

6305
05:29:48,189 --> 05:29:48,669
It does.

6306
05:29:50,380 --> 05:29:57,819
I would say we should probably go south.

6307
05:29:57,819 --> 05:30:00,619
I remember when I was in the poison swamp one time.

6308
05:30:03,020 --> 05:30:07,740
The amount of damage and disease it causes.

6309
05:30:07,740 --> 05:30:11,419
Onward with sick in a moment's notice being down here.

6310
05:30:12,060 --> 05:30:14,880
Truly a disgusting...

6311
05:30:14,880 --> 05:30:15,439
Adventurer!

6312
05:30:16,080 --> 05:30:17,040
Goblins are afoot!

6313
05:30:27,959 --> 05:30:28,680
Don't let him run!

6314
05:30:35,000 --> 05:30:35,720
Poisonous.

6315
05:30:36,599 --> 05:30:38,200
Very, very disgusting.

6316
05:30:38,200 --> 05:30:41,080
Anyone would take five points of damage if they walked down here.

6317
05:30:44,779 --> 05:30:45,419
Adventurer!

6318
05:30:45,419 --> 05:30:45,979
Goblins!

6319
05:31:09,209 --> 05:31:10,409
Hold on, I know...

6320
05:31:15,340 --> 05:31:18,970
These halls are full of all kinds of dangerous things.

6321
05:31:21,259 --> 05:31:23,520
Ah, that feels better.

6322
05:31:27,479 --> 05:31:29,799
Ah, that feels better.

6323
05:31:30,360 --> 05:31:34,619
Oh my god, is it you?

6324
05:31:34,619 --> 05:31:35,659
That feels better.

6325
05:31:40,040 --> 05:31:40,439
All right.

6326
05:31:44,009 --> 05:31:44,810
We are safe here.

6327
05:31:46,330 --> 05:31:47,799
The dungeon was built...

6328
05:31:47,799 --> 05:31:49,159
I would like to participate...

6329
05:31:49,159 --> 05:31:51,880
...back in 1500 BC.

6330
05:31:52,439 --> 05:31:56,400
It stood for many years.

6331
05:31:57,900 --> 05:32:02,909
Poison is actually dragon's breath, if you didn't know.

6332
05:32:02,909 --> 05:32:08,799
Five million years ago, the dragon Allora died down here.

6333
05:32:08,799 --> 05:32:15,000
And their spit is what causes most of the poison, if you didn't know.

6334
05:32:15,000 --> 05:32:16,040
Adventurer!

6335
05:32:16,040 --> 05:32:16,520
Goblins!

6336
05:32:38,520 --> 05:32:41,900
Oh, I'm about to die.

6337
05:32:41,900 --> 05:32:42,619
A portal!

6338
05:32:43,500 --> 05:32:44,459
There's the portal!

6339
05:32:52,319 --> 05:32:52,959
The portal!

6340
05:32:53,520 --> 05:32:59,159
There's the portal!

6341
05:32:59,159 --> 05:33:00,439
Want to leave?

6342
05:33:00,439 --> 05:33:09,319
The dragon breathed four thousand percent five million years ago.

6343
05:33:10,909 --> 05:33:12,509
I thank you for helping me.

6344
05:33:14,110 --> 05:33:16,509
Listen, don't forget about me, general.

6345
05:33:16,509 --> 05:33:17,229
Here is the...

6346
05:33:17,229 --> 05:33:18,270
Don't forget about me.

6347
05:33:18,270 --> 05:33:20,750
Here's your shitty reward for me.

6348
05:33:22,029 --> 05:33:22,509
He...

6349
05:33:22,509 --> 05:33:23,150
He took it.

6350
05:33:24,139 --> 05:33:29,150
Here's your shitty reward for your level one quest.

6351
05:33:29,150 --> 05:33:29,549
Thank you.

6352
05:33:29,549 --> 05:33:30,189
Thank you.

6353
05:33:30,189 --> 05:33:31,630
I will go in the portal now.

6354
05:33:34,380 --> 05:33:35,020
He took it.

6355
05:33:47,529 --> 05:33:48,970
Hey, there's people here.

6356
05:33:49,529 --> 05:33:50,330
Adventurer!

6357
05:33:50,330 --> 05:33:50,810
Goblins!

6358
05:33:56,090 --> 05:33:58,569
Use the strength of a thousand sons!

6359
05:34:02,860 --> 05:34:04,299
Here, take this, Adventurer.

6360
05:34:05,020 --> 05:34:05,740
You could use it.

6361
05:34:06,380 --> 05:34:07,659
Oh, shit, he escaped.

6362
05:34:29,130 --> 05:34:44,139
The dragon five thousand years ago was the shittiest NPC of any fucking game ever.

6363
05:34:44,139 --> 05:34:53,880
Hey, they played along, it was fun.

6364
05:34:53,880 --> 05:34:55,000
All right, let's do a real one.

6365
05:34:55,000 --> 05:35:09,279
Oh, the dragon...

6366
05:35:10,169 --> 05:35:11,049
Alloro?

6367
05:35:11,049 --> 05:35:12,650
I don't even know what the dragon's name was.

6368
05:35:12,650 --> 05:35:40,889
General, you could have donated those seventy five...

6369
05:35:40,889 --> 05:35:41,369
Do you mean...

6370
05:35:41,369 --> 05:35:42,650
Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.

6371
05:35:42,650 --> 05:35:45,049
I just want to make sure I'm very clear of what you're asking me.

6372
05:35:45,049 --> 05:35:50,349
Are you talking about the family guy money from ten years ago?

6373
05:35:52,759 --> 05:36:17,869
Why are you bringing that up right now?

6374
05:36:17,869 --> 05:36:18,430
Anything?

6375
05:36:18,430 --> 05:36:19,069
Anything?

6376
05:36:19,069 --> 05:36:20,110
Okay, easy.

6377
05:36:20,110 --> 05:36:28,830
Good start.

6378
05:36:28,830 --> 05:36:29,389
Let's go.

6379
05:36:29,389 --> 05:36:35,130
I ain't going that way.

6380
05:36:35,130 --> 05:36:38,799
Actually, did I just get one?

6381
05:36:38,799 --> 05:36:39,770
Yeah, I did.

6382
05:36:39,770 --> 05:37:08,090
Okay, don't screw this up.

6383
05:37:08,090 --> 05:37:25,470
It's really easy to screw it up in solo.

6384
05:37:25,470 --> 05:37:26,909
You always think it's safe and it never is.

6385
05:37:40,970 --> 05:37:42,060
Okay, come on.

6386
05:37:42,060 --> 05:37:44,139
Through the door and then I'm going to close it.

6387
05:37:44,139 --> 05:37:48,090
That's how you do it.

6388
05:37:48,090 --> 05:38:08,520
Cool.

6389
05:38:08,520 --> 05:38:09,240
There we go.

6390
05:38:09,799 --> 05:38:19,840
That's actually really good for a green.

6391
05:38:19,840 --> 05:38:20,799
Oh, shit.

6392
05:38:20,799 --> 05:38:26,729
I didn't want to press that button and I did.

6393
05:38:26,729 --> 05:38:27,849
I didn't mean to.

6394
05:38:27,849 --> 05:38:28,729
Oh, don't panic.

6395
05:38:28,729 --> 05:38:29,450
Just fucking go.

6396
05:38:29,450 --> 05:38:30,330
I fucked it up.

6397
05:38:30,330 --> 05:38:34,599
I was so afraid of going back into this room.

6398
05:38:50,080 --> 05:38:56,250
This is not going like terribly.

6399
05:38:56,970 --> 05:39:03,880
This weapon is really good, though, for a green.

6400
05:39:03,880 --> 05:39:07,689
I don't want to lose it.

6401
05:39:07,689 --> 05:39:08,409
Fuck.

6402
05:39:08,409 --> 05:39:17,369
Open, open, open, open, open, open, open.

6403
05:39:19,930 --> 05:39:30,189
Somebody was already here.

6404
05:39:30,189 --> 05:39:40,360
Oh, my God.

6405
05:39:40,360 --> 05:39:41,159
Oh, thank God.

6406
05:39:41,159 --> 05:39:59,689
A lot of stuff running down here.

6407
05:39:59,689 --> 05:40:00,970
I got to look for a portal.

6408
05:40:00,970 --> 05:40:10,319
Oh, yeah.

6409
05:40:10,319 --> 05:40:10,959
Strength, too.

6410
05:40:10,959 --> 05:40:21,709
These have stats.

6411
05:40:21,709 --> 05:40:23,229
Six, agility.

6412
05:40:23,229 --> 05:40:25,099
Where are you?

6413
05:40:25,099 --> 05:40:25,580
You?

6414
05:40:25,580 --> 05:40:26,380
Oh, he's gone.

6415
05:40:26,380 --> 05:40:45,560
Oh, somebody closed it.

6416
05:40:45,560 --> 05:40:46,360
You got a shield.

6417
05:40:46,360 --> 05:41:14,540
I don't want to fuck with that.

6418
05:41:14,540 --> 05:41:15,580
You can have half.

6419
05:41:15,580 --> 05:41:16,319
That's how it works.

6420
05:41:16,319 --> 05:41:17,119
You can have half.

6421
05:41:17,119 --> 05:41:20,880
I was hoping he was going to just attack me.

6422
05:41:20,880 --> 05:41:22,319
I just took way more than half.

6423
05:41:22,319 --> 05:41:42,540
No, this is yours.

6424
05:41:42,540 --> 05:41:43,419
I took way more than that.

6425
05:41:46,650 --> 05:41:53,279
Okay.

6426
05:41:53,279 --> 05:41:54,639
Traitor Andy.

6427
05:41:54,639 --> 05:42:04,220
What is going on?

6428
05:42:04,220 --> 05:42:05,819
Oh, I thought he was swinging at me.

6429
05:42:05,819 --> 05:42:07,580
Sorry, be safe.

6430
05:42:07,580 --> 05:42:13,439
I don't have much, but whatever.

6431
05:42:13,439 --> 05:42:14,720
I do want to get out with this weapon.

6432
05:42:14,720 --> 05:42:24,000
Nice work.

6433
05:42:24,000 --> 05:42:28,639
Shit.

6434
05:42:28,639 --> 05:42:31,479
It's too dark.

6435
05:42:31,479 --> 05:42:38,319
Oh, boy.

6436
05:42:38,319 --> 05:42:39,040
This is very bad.

6437
05:42:47,840 --> 05:42:48,319
Stuck.

6438
05:42:48,319 --> 05:42:51,630
I'm stuck.

6439
05:42:51,630 --> 05:42:52,669
Oh, fuck.

6440
05:42:52,669 --> 05:42:53,470
Look out.

6441
05:42:53,470 --> 05:42:54,349
Be careful.

6442
05:42:54,349 --> 05:42:57,159
I'm going to bleed to death, aren't I?

6443
05:42:57,159 --> 05:42:58,119
Oh, they're right here.

6444
05:43:02,830 --> 05:43:04,119
Be careful.

6445
05:43:04,119 --> 05:43:05,400
It's not safe.

6446
05:43:05,400 --> 05:43:13,340
You literally saved my life.

6447
05:43:13,340 --> 05:43:21,470
Before we leave, I'm going to give you a trinket.

6448
05:43:21,470 --> 05:43:39,240
Is this the last portal?

6449
05:43:39,240 --> 05:44:05,020
Oh, I don't know if there's any more.

6450
05:44:05,020 --> 05:44:07,950
There's one more.

6451
05:44:07,950 --> 05:44:09,549
It'll spawn when it's closing again.

6452
05:44:09,549 --> 05:44:11,639
Okay.

6453
05:44:11,639 --> 05:44:26,299
Good to know.

6454
05:44:26,299 --> 05:44:27,419
Shit, there's no portal in here.

6455
05:44:27,419 --> 05:44:28,220
This is so annoying.

6456
05:44:28,220 --> 05:44:29,099
It's probably up.

6457
05:44:29,099 --> 05:44:30,750
That's so annoying.

6458
05:44:30,750 --> 05:44:31,709
The portal's probably up.

6459
05:44:31,709 --> 05:44:46,240
Okay, cool.

6460
05:44:46,240 --> 05:44:48,400
I mean, didn't really get very much, but I did.

6461
05:44:48,400 --> 05:44:49,680
I actually really wanted to hold on to this.

6462
05:44:49,680 --> 05:44:50,479
This thing's pretty good.

6463
05:44:50,479 --> 05:45:08,220
I feel like I haven't traded anything to the merchant in like an hour and a half.

6464
05:45:08,220 --> 05:45:09,020
No, no, no, no.

6465
05:45:09,020 --> 05:45:14,880
Keep those two.

6466
05:45:14,880 --> 05:45:26,250
Get rid of these.

6467
05:45:26,250 --> 05:45:27,290
And one strength.

6468
05:45:30,029 --> 05:45:32,479
I mean, that's kind of good, though.

6469
05:45:32,479 --> 05:45:39,959
Only three gold.

6470
05:45:39,959 --> 05:45:40,759
That's kind of terrible.

6471
05:45:51,159 --> 05:45:59,500
Let me get rid of some of this silver.

6472
05:45:59,500 --> 05:46:12,750
I know if people are saying to buy these, but I like having...

6473
05:46:13,310 --> 05:46:13,869
Not yet.

6474
05:46:13,869 --> 05:46:20,159
I don't need it yet.

6475
05:46:20,159 --> 05:46:31,580
Once this comes down to halfway, I'm ready to show this off to anybody,

6476
05:46:31,580 --> 05:46:32,860
but I'm afraid to use it.

6477
05:46:32,860 --> 05:46:39,659
I'm still holding this.

6478
05:46:45,599 --> 05:46:47,439
I'm going to do it again.

6479
05:46:47,439 --> 05:46:49,680
I have gear.

6480
05:46:49,680 --> 05:47:02,430
Actually, I'm going to buy some potions and stuff.

6481
05:47:02,430 --> 05:47:03,150
Bandages.

6482
05:47:03,150 --> 05:47:26,040
There's four portals now.

6483
05:47:26,040 --> 05:47:28,279
That's good.

6484
05:47:28,279 --> 05:47:30,409
That's actually really good.

6485
05:47:30,409 --> 05:47:47,869
That went down.

6486
05:48:10,330 --> 05:48:11,130
No, really?

6487
05:48:11,689 --> 05:48:16,560
Oh, don't even.

6488
05:48:24,990 --> 05:48:28,490
Trying to hit them both.

6489
05:48:28,490 --> 05:48:29,130
What?

6490
05:48:29,130 --> 05:48:34,299
Well, glad I brought these.

6491
05:48:34,299 --> 05:48:46,220
I did it.

6492
05:48:46,220 --> 05:48:47,900
I killed the goblin king.

6493
05:48:48,700 --> 05:48:49,340
I've done it.

6494
05:48:49,340 --> 05:48:50,459
That wasn't the king.

6495
05:48:51,180 --> 05:48:51,979
That's a lackey.

6496
05:48:51,979 --> 05:48:58,959
You don't fucking know what you're doing.

6497
05:48:58,959 --> 05:49:00,479
No, I killed the king.

6498
05:49:01,040 --> 05:49:02,080
I killed the king earlier.

6499
05:49:02,080 --> 05:49:02,479
It was me.

6500
05:49:06,279 --> 05:49:07,080
I killed the king earlier.

6501
05:49:07,080 --> 05:49:07,639
You didn't kill the king.

6502
05:49:07,639 --> 05:49:08,279
It was me that did it.

6503
05:49:09,630 --> 05:49:15,419
Here, take this.

6504
05:49:15,419 --> 05:49:23,130
Let's have fire.

6505
05:49:23,130 --> 05:49:24,650
Can you just give it to me?

6506
05:49:24,650 --> 05:49:31,229
On the ground, right here.

6507
05:49:31,229 --> 05:49:33,709
Yeah, worth a bunch of money.

6508
05:49:33,709 --> 05:49:47,360
I'm a cleric, so if you ever need patching up, little, you know...

6509
05:49:51,080 --> 05:49:51,799
I'm a loner.

6510
05:49:53,159 --> 05:49:56,439
I'm a loner, and I don't really have a party or anything.

6511
05:49:56,439 --> 05:50:00,000
So it's really nice to meet you, though.

6512
05:50:00,080 --> 05:50:01,200
Like, what kind of party?

6513
05:50:01,200 --> 05:50:02,799
Are you throwing, like, a birthday party?

6514
05:50:02,799 --> 05:50:04,319
Or it's like a...

6515
05:50:04,319 --> 05:50:04,880
Wait.

6516
05:50:04,880 --> 05:50:05,360
Hey, now.

6517
05:50:10,360 --> 05:50:17,369
We should group up.

6518
05:50:17,369 --> 05:50:29,639
Are you good on here?

6519
05:50:34,799 --> 05:50:36,720
I'm supposed to stand there, get poked again.

6520
05:50:37,279 --> 05:50:38,560
Right into the ear.

6521
05:50:38,560 --> 05:50:39,279
Do you have any potions?

6522
05:50:39,279 --> 05:50:39,919
Are you good on potions?

6523
05:50:41,819 --> 05:50:43,099
I got too many potions.

6524
05:50:43,740 --> 05:50:46,619
I also got this wine bottle.

6525
05:50:48,270 --> 05:50:51,150
We could have a little cabaret dinner.

6526
05:50:52,110 --> 05:50:54,139
That looks dangerous.

6527
05:50:57,020 --> 05:50:58,939
The hole is not dangerous.

6528
05:50:58,939 --> 05:51:01,020
You almost got poked in the ear again.

6529
05:51:01,020 --> 05:51:02,060
Yeah, it was close, though.

6530
05:51:07,950 --> 05:51:13,209
You got a little beetle.

6531
05:51:16,240 --> 05:51:18,080
Calgimus, forcimus.

6532
05:51:18,880 --> 05:51:29,759
Watch out.

6533
05:51:29,759 --> 05:51:34,220
Oh, he's dead.

6534
05:51:34,220 --> 05:51:35,580
No, wait, how did he die?

6535
05:51:36,299 --> 05:51:36,939
Oh, no.

6536
05:51:38,939 --> 05:51:39,819
He stopped talking.

6537
05:51:40,380 --> 05:51:40,860
I was about to...

6538
05:51:40,860 --> 05:51:41,659
I was going to do, like, a...

6539
05:51:41,659 --> 05:51:43,180
I was going to do a face turn.

6540
05:51:44,700 --> 05:51:45,500
Oh, no.

6541
05:51:45,500 --> 05:51:48,060
I was going to do a face turn and beetle...

6542
05:51:48,060 --> 05:51:58,189
Oh, God.

6543
05:52:00,459 --> 05:52:01,020
I hit him.

6544
05:52:01,020 --> 05:52:03,450
No, I didn't.

6545
05:52:03,450 --> 05:52:06,009
I was just trying to be, like, the weird guy in the dungeon.

6546
05:52:09,150 --> 05:52:10,349
Get me off voice chat.

6547
05:52:10,349 --> 05:52:12,509
I can't play the game with this proximity chat.

6548
05:52:25,959 --> 05:52:27,389
Turn it off.

6549
05:52:28,349 --> 05:52:29,310
I have to stop this.

6550
05:52:29,310 --> 05:52:46,860
Just closing the door and then he opens the door.

6551
05:52:46,860 --> 05:53:08,279
I'm just standing there at the end of the hallway.

6552
05:53:08,279 --> 05:53:09,880
One normal round.

6553
05:53:09,880 --> 05:53:12,669
Turn it back on.

6554
05:53:12,669 --> 05:53:29,979
I'm not going to do an L-M-O-R-P.

6555
05:53:29,979 --> 05:53:33,080
You're trying to, like, make 10,000 people leave.

6556
05:53:33,080 --> 05:53:54,459
God, how did that not reach?

6557
05:53:54,459 --> 05:53:56,279
Actually, thanks.

6558
05:53:56,279 --> 05:53:56,919
That helped.

6559
05:54:07,229 --> 05:54:08,349
Why am I so slow?

6560
05:54:08,349 --> 05:54:10,490
Oh, that's a debuff that I'm...

6561
05:54:10,490 --> 05:54:10,729
Okay.

6562
05:54:10,729 --> 05:54:11,049
Oh, no.

6563
05:54:11,049 --> 05:54:19,150
You're going to heal, aren't you?

6564
05:54:19,150 --> 05:54:20,430
Cool, but I can't use it.

6565
05:54:20,430 --> 05:54:47,119
Somebody's coming.

6566
05:54:49,740 --> 05:54:53,470
Crouch.

6567
05:54:53,470 --> 05:54:55,150
RP where you pretend to be really good.

6568
05:54:55,150 --> 05:54:56,459
I can try that.

6569
05:55:13,119 --> 05:55:13,439
I'm sorry.

6570
05:55:13,439 --> 05:55:14,720
I probably just woke somebody up.

6571
05:55:14,720 --> 05:55:57,200
Trying to, like, freak that person out.

6572
05:55:57,200 --> 05:55:58,720
I just lost a fucking torch.

6573
05:55:58,720 --> 05:55:59,439
That's all that happened.

6574
05:56:16,459 --> 05:56:17,849
Not...

6575
05:56:17,849 --> 05:56:18,569
No.

6576
05:56:18,569 --> 05:56:19,450
This room is awful.

6577
05:56:29,450 --> 05:56:31,080
I'm going to go up.

6578
05:56:31,080 --> 05:56:45,950
God damn it.

6579
05:56:45,950 --> 05:56:46,509
It's junk.

6580
05:56:48,479 --> 05:57:02,520
SpongeBob RP.

6581
05:57:02,520 --> 05:57:05,790
Look at all this crap.

6582
05:57:05,790 --> 05:57:06,590
I have to get out of here.

6583
05:57:39,159 --> 05:57:39,959
Shit.

6584
05:57:39,959 --> 05:57:44,330
How...

6585
05:57:44,330 --> 05:57:44,650
I'm...

6586
05:57:44,650 --> 05:57:45,450
How do I get up there?

6587
05:57:49,240 --> 05:57:50,700
I don't...

6588
05:57:50,700 --> 05:57:52,830
Can I get up there?

6589
05:57:52,830 --> 05:57:55,759
I think I'm, like, trapped.

6590
05:58:26,200 --> 05:58:30,409
I'm going to die.

6591
05:58:35,790 --> 05:58:46,439
That was pretty close.

6592
05:58:46,439 --> 05:58:56,479
Any scraps?

6593
05:58:56,479 --> 05:59:04,349
Oh, my goodness.

6594
05:59:04,349 --> 05:59:15,400
Am I invisible?

6595
05:59:15,400 --> 05:59:20,430
Where the fuck are the eggs at?

6596
05:59:21,150 --> 05:59:22,250
I don't know.

6597
05:59:23,450 --> 05:59:23,770
Ow.

6598
05:59:24,650 --> 05:59:27,950
Did you just get caved in on?

6599
05:59:31,439 --> 05:59:31,680
What?

6600
05:59:35,369 --> 05:59:37,599
You got it.

6601
05:59:43,520 --> 05:59:43,840
Yeah.

6602
05:59:44,479 --> 05:59:45,360
I think there's one more.

6603
06:00:12,830 --> 06:00:16,169
What the fuck was that?

6604
06:00:20,939 --> 06:00:21,900
Was that Elmo?

6605
06:00:21,900 --> 06:00:22,880
That was weird.

6606
06:00:22,880 --> 06:00:28,919
Who is doing that?

6607
06:00:28,919 --> 06:00:29,319
Shut up.

6608
06:00:34,479 --> 06:00:38,400
Is it anybody else?

6609
06:00:38,400 --> 06:00:40,830
No, it's just this guy.

6610
06:00:44,250 --> 06:00:45,610
It had to be me.

6611
06:00:45,610 --> 06:00:52,970
There's nobody else in the lobby.

6612
06:00:52,970 --> 06:00:53,770
It had to be me.

6613
06:00:53,770 --> 06:01:03,180
I thought there was two or three people left.

6614
06:01:03,180 --> 06:01:04,459
You watch what...

6615
06:01:04,459 --> 06:01:05,900
You have to watch him.

6616
06:01:05,900 --> 06:01:12,909
Let's see if he can escape.

6617
06:01:12,909 --> 06:01:20,750
I wish you luck.

6618
06:01:20,750 --> 06:01:26,830
Is that...

6619
06:01:26,830 --> 06:01:27,549
Ooh.

6620
06:01:27,549 --> 06:01:35,840
I think you're going to get out.

6621
06:01:35,840 --> 06:01:36,639
Yeah.

6622
06:01:36,639 --> 06:01:37,279
There we go.

6623
06:01:37,279 --> 06:01:38,700
It's all good.

6624
06:01:38,700 --> 06:01:51,119
Eugene.

6625
06:01:51,119 --> 06:01:52,639
I'm going to throw a little bit of a curve ball here.

6626
06:01:52,639 --> 06:01:54,000
I'm going to do one more round.

6627
06:01:54,959 --> 06:01:55,360
Yeah, look.

6628
06:01:55,360 --> 06:01:57,529
I didn't really get anything.

6629
06:01:57,529 --> 06:01:58,569
I'm going to try a different class.

6630
06:01:58,569 --> 06:02:00,119
I'm going to go level one.

6631
06:02:00,119 --> 06:02:07,869
Not that it matters, but that's the wrong button.

6632
06:02:07,869 --> 06:02:29,229
You can sell from the stash?

6633
06:02:29,229 --> 06:02:33,360
Really?

6634
06:02:33,360 --> 06:02:34,720
Will I play the Metroid remaster?

6635
06:02:34,720 --> 06:02:36,799
I never played Metroid Prime.

6636
06:02:36,799 --> 06:02:45,159
It always looked interesting, but this was something I never really grasped.

6637
06:02:45,159 --> 06:02:48,569
For me, the Wii was always...

6638
06:02:49,450 --> 06:02:54,330
All the FPSs that were on Wii were so good.

6639
06:02:54,330 --> 06:02:57,310
Resident Evil 4 for the Wii is my favorite version of that game.

6640
06:02:57,310 --> 06:02:58,750
Obviously before it came to PC.

6641
06:02:58,750 --> 06:02:59,310
But even...

6642
06:02:59,310 --> 06:02:59,709
I don't know.

6643
06:02:59,709 --> 06:03:03,930
Even still, I really liked it on Wii.

6644
06:03:03,930 --> 06:03:05,689
It was really fun to aim with it.

6645
06:03:06,090 --> 06:03:07,049
Seemed pretty responsive.

6646
06:03:16,959 --> 06:03:17,200
All right.

6647
06:03:17,200 --> 06:03:17,759
Let me do...

6648
06:03:18,560 --> 06:03:20,959
Let me do one in the normal place.

6649
06:03:20,959 --> 06:03:25,439
But then after this, I'm going to change.

6650
06:03:25,439 --> 06:03:42,279
Wizard?

6651
06:03:42,279 --> 06:03:49,229
I don't know if I'm a wizard player.

6652
06:03:49,229 --> 06:03:51,930
I usually like to play casters and RPGs or whatever.

6653
06:03:51,930 --> 06:03:55,520
But it feels like there's a lot of micromanagement with wizard.

6654
06:03:55,520 --> 06:04:15,419
I'd rather just swing at stuff.

6655
06:04:15,419 --> 06:04:16,139
Helpful.

6656
06:04:16,139 --> 06:04:23,200
I did?

6657
06:04:23,200 --> 06:04:24,459
Yes.

6658
06:04:24,459 --> 06:04:36,779
Okay, you can't come through that.

6659
06:04:36,779 --> 06:04:37,419
No.

6660
06:04:37,419 --> 06:04:47,470
Do a golem RP.

6661
06:04:53,130 --> 06:04:54,650
Armor or magic now?

6662
06:04:54,650 --> 06:04:55,610
I mean, I'll hold on to these.

6663
06:04:56,250 --> 06:05:00,240
Oh, shit.

6664
06:05:00,240 --> 06:05:00,880
Let me in there.

6665
06:05:01,520 --> 06:05:19,959
I feel like that's really, really, really good.

6666
06:05:20,520 --> 06:05:23,080
It's just one of those unbelievable stat things.

6667
06:05:23,080 --> 06:05:24,279
That's really good.

6668
06:05:24,279 --> 06:05:25,950
I actually don't want to lose now.

6669
06:05:25,950 --> 06:05:30,959
Not like I wanted to before, but you know.

6670
06:05:52,729 --> 06:05:53,209
Damn.

6671
06:05:53,209 --> 06:05:54,569
Okay, this is what I'm talking about.

6672
06:05:54,569 --> 06:06:08,599
Oh, my God.

6673
06:06:08,599 --> 06:06:09,159
All right.

6674
06:06:09,159 --> 06:06:10,200
After this, if this is good,

6675
06:06:10,200 --> 06:06:11,479
I'm just going to literally sneak around.

6676
06:06:11,479 --> 06:06:35,680
Shit.

6677
06:06:35,680 --> 06:06:51,099
RP is you're drunk?

6678
06:06:51,099 --> 06:07:18,250
That's going to be so annoying.

6679
06:07:18,250 --> 06:07:18,889
People?

6680
06:07:18,889 --> 06:07:26,139
Somebody's here?

6681
06:07:26,139 --> 06:07:29,340
Oh, I don't even know how to play.

6682
06:07:29,340 --> 06:07:33,709
I don't even know where the hell to go.

6683
06:07:33,709 --> 06:07:37,659
I don't even know where to go.

6684
06:07:37,659 --> 06:07:38,220
Down here?

6685
06:07:38,220 --> 06:07:38,700
I don't know.

6686
06:07:52,599 --> 06:07:58,040
I literally don't know where to go.

6687
06:07:58,040 --> 06:08:00,520
I tried to do the drunk RP.

6688
06:08:01,080 --> 06:08:02,439
I don't know where to go.

6689
06:08:02,439 --> 06:08:03,900
And I was just...

6690
06:08:03,900 --> 06:08:06,459
Drunk RP means easy kill.

6691
06:08:06,459 --> 06:08:11,000
Yes, I'm realizing this right now.

6692
06:08:11,000 --> 06:08:11,639
That's...

6693
06:08:11,639 --> 06:08:13,560
Hey, this dude's shit face.

6694
06:08:13,560 --> 06:08:15,900
He probably has no idea what he's doing.

6695
06:08:15,900 --> 06:08:16,459
Just kill him.

6696
06:08:30,459 --> 06:08:31,500
Destroyed.

6697
06:08:31,500 --> 06:08:40,520
Just act crazy.

6698
06:08:40,520 --> 06:08:42,200
That was some good shit, too.

6699
06:08:42,200 --> 06:08:44,619
The mistake was going into that room.

6700
06:08:44,619 --> 06:08:46,060
I should have just turned around and ran.

6701
06:08:46,060 --> 06:09:07,069
Wait.

6702
06:09:07,069 --> 06:09:07,790
I got health here.

6703
06:09:07,790 --> 06:09:08,349
Whatever.

6704
06:09:08,349 --> 06:09:19,880
Oh, my God.

6705
06:09:19,880 --> 06:09:24,779
Good start.

6706
06:09:28,159 --> 06:09:31,790
Good start.

6707
06:09:31,790 --> 06:09:34,909
I'm going to take that in a little bit.

6708
06:09:34,909 --> 06:09:46,330
I have to play really, really passively.

6709
06:09:46,330 --> 06:10:02,830
Where is this spawner?

6710
06:10:02,830 --> 06:10:04,909
I forgot to buy potions again.

6711
06:10:04,909 --> 06:10:13,200
I'm going this way.

6712
06:10:13,200 --> 06:10:34,799
Okay.

6713
06:10:40,349 --> 06:10:55,630
Here's somebody.

6714
06:11:16,380 --> 06:11:17,340
Oh, shit.

6715
06:11:17,340 --> 06:11:20,599
Uh, where's the lever?

6716
06:11:20,599 --> 06:12:20,669
Stream sniper!

6717
06:12:20,669 --> 06:12:21,709
Stream sniper!

6718
06:12:21,709 --> 06:12:22,669
Stream sniper!

6719
06:12:22,669 --> 06:12:36,080
Stream sniper!

6720
06:12:36,080 --> 06:12:38,909
Actually, I'm going to stay here.

6721
06:12:38,909 --> 06:12:59,930
You got me right in the head, too.

6722
06:12:59,930 --> 06:13:08,669
There's stuff in here.

6723
06:13:08,669 --> 06:13:16,360
Is that locked?

6724
06:13:16,360 --> 06:13:17,639
Oh, my God.

6725
06:13:17,639 --> 06:13:18,520
Oh, my God.

6726
06:13:18,520 --> 06:13:19,080
I'm dead.

6727
06:13:24,319 --> 06:13:25,599
I don't know, man.

6728
06:13:25,599 --> 06:13:27,439
Like, that just did almost my whole-

6729
06:13:27,439 --> 06:13:29,119
That just killed me in one hit almost.

6730
06:13:29,119 --> 06:13:31,419
How do-

6731
06:13:31,419 --> 06:13:32,060
All right.

6732
06:13:32,060 --> 06:13:34,220
How do you fight those as melee?

6733
06:13:34,220 --> 06:13:37,360
I feel like they just blow up the area

6734
06:13:37,360 --> 06:13:39,360
like 15 feet in front of them.

6735
06:13:39,360 --> 06:13:41,520
How do you fight those mages as melee?

6736
06:13:41,520 --> 06:13:47,290
You have to jump dodge.

6737
06:13:47,290 --> 06:13:48,169
You don't.

6738
06:13:48,169 --> 06:13:48,810
You run.

6739
06:13:48,810 --> 06:13:50,090
You have to bait the shot.

6740
06:13:50,090 --> 06:13:53,549
That was an elite, too.

6741
06:13:53,549 --> 06:13:53,950
Yeah.

6742
06:13:53,950 --> 06:14:15,720
Let's fucking go.

6743
06:14:44,810 --> 06:14:52,919
Don't ever buy grace.

6744
06:14:52,919 --> 06:14:53,720
I don't care.

6745
06:14:53,720 --> 06:14:57,759
I'm going hard right now.

6746
06:14:59,400 --> 06:15:07,580
And I'm getting out.

6747
06:15:07,580 --> 06:15:11,689
Hey, like we were saying earlier,

6748
06:15:11,689 --> 06:15:14,220
beta ends in three, four days.

6749
06:15:14,220 --> 06:15:14,860
Whatever.

6750
06:15:14,860 --> 06:15:36,110
Are we ready?

6751
06:15:36,110 --> 06:15:44,439
This is a-

6752
06:15:44,439 --> 06:15:45,560
This is a big deal.

6753
06:15:45,560 --> 06:15:50,040
I'm about to do this in the goblin zone.

6754
06:15:50,040 --> 06:15:51,799
And by the way,

6755
06:15:51,799 --> 06:15:52,919
I ain't fucking around.

6756
06:15:52,919 --> 06:15:54,729
I ain't friends with anybody.

6757
06:15:54,729 --> 06:15:55,930
Nobody's friends.

6758
06:15:55,930 --> 06:15:56,250
We're not-

6759
06:15:56,250 --> 06:15:57,209
I'm not friends with anybody.

6760
06:15:57,209 --> 06:16:01,880
I think I'm ready.

6761
06:16:01,880 --> 06:16:23,849
It's locked in now.

6762
06:16:23,849 --> 06:16:25,790
Every single person is my enemy.

6763
06:16:25,790 --> 06:16:26,349
Not-

6764
06:16:26,349 --> 06:16:26,590
I-

6765
06:16:26,590 --> 06:16:28,439
I'm not wasting any time.

6766
06:16:28,439 --> 06:16:29,959
Congratulations to the stream snipers

6767
06:16:29,959 --> 06:16:32,279
that now are going to get a nice sword,

6768
06:16:32,279 --> 06:16:33,880
by the way.

6769
06:16:33,880 --> 06:16:35,479
Or you got to get me.

6770
06:16:35,479 --> 06:16:36,439
You got to kill me by the-

6771
06:16:36,439 --> 06:16:37,080
By the way.

6772
06:16:37,080 --> 06:16:44,569
I'm going to be silent as well.

6773
06:17:28,919 --> 06:17:30,639
What do you got?

6774
06:17:30,639 --> 06:17:44,430
Good start.

6775
06:17:44,430 --> 06:17:44,990
After these chests,

6776
06:17:44,990 --> 06:17:46,110
I'm going right in the middle.

6777
06:17:46,110 --> 06:18:19,849
Is there a potion?

6778
06:18:19,849 --> 06:18:20,650
I didn't see one.

6779
06:18:20,650 --> 06:18:25,470
Holy shit, there is a potion.

6780
06:18:25,470 --> 06:18:26,270
Good eyes.

6781
06:18:26,270 --> 06:19:37,759
I'm on a way out.

6782
06:19:37,759 --> 06:19:38,639
He ducked.

6783
06:19:38,639 --> 06:19:39,599
His animation-

6784
06:19:39,599 --> 06:19:40,400
Stop!

6785
06:19:40,400 --> 06:19:42,939
His animation made him duck.

6786
06:19:42,939 --> 06:20:49,159
Start looking for portals really soon here.

6787
06:20:49,159 --> 06:21:24,599
This thing is fucking unbelievably good.

6788
06:21:24,599 --> 06:21:25,479
All right, portal time.

6789
06:22:20,619 --> 06:22:40,159
Oh, I made it.

6790
06:22:46,520 --> 06:22:47,240
I had a choice,

6791
06:22:47,240 --> 06:22:51,740
and that was to open the portal and take a hit,

6792
06:22:51,740 --> 06:22:59,520
or lose the portal.

6793
06:22:59,520 --> 06:23:05,930
Thank god.

6794
06:23:05,930 --> 06:23:07,689
My adrenaline is like on fire.

6795
06:23:07,689 --> 06:23:08,569
It's just so-

6796
06:23:08,569 --> 06:23:09,369
Oh my goodness,

6797
06:23:09,369 --> 06:23:11,369
because you don't want to lose this thing, right?

6798
06:23:11,369 --> 06:23:13,240
Oh my god.

6799
06:23:13,240 --> 06:23:34,990
Okay, let's put it away for another three days.

6800
06:23:34,990 --> 06:23:35,950
I might actually-

6801
06:23:46,380 --> 06:23:47,099
Eh.

6802
06:23:47,099 --> 06:24:12,540
Oh, I don't have a weapon now.

6803
06:24:12,540 --> 06:24:13,340
Buy one?

6804
06:24:13,340 --> 06:24:15,040
You gamble?

6805
06:24:15,040 --> 06:24:15,520
Actually, yeah.

6806
06:24:15,520 --> 06:24:16,080
What do we got?

6807
06:24:22,270 --> 06:24:26,250
Try to gamble for like a decent weapon?

6808
06:24:26,250 --> 06:24:31,790
Or-

6809
06:24:31,790 --> 06:24:32,270
All right.

6810
06:24:32,270 --> 06:24:34,169
Do a weld, Andy.

6811
06:24:34,169 --> 06:24:36,520
I'm all right with this.

6812
06:24:36,520 --> 06:24:45,689
Thankfully, I didn't die,

6813
06:24:45,689 --> 06:24:47,290
so I get to keep the potions and everything.

6814
06:24:47,290 --> 06:24:51,240
I think I'm good to go.

6815
06:24:51,240 --> 06:24:59,959
This is pretty good.

6816
06:24:59,959 --> 06:25:01,000
Yeah, let's do it again.

6817
06:25:01,000 --> 06:25:11,400
Oh shit, I don't have any torches.

6818
06:25:11,400 --> 06:25:19,000
Do you have any feedback for the game?

6819
06:25:21,200 --> 06:25:27,529
I think it's in a really close spot.

6820
06:25:27,529 --> 06:25:29,319
I think that some of the-

6821
06:25:29,319 --> 06:25:31,040
There's obviously some of the weird bugs

6822
06:25:31,040 --> 06:25:32,799
when you click to swing or click to block

6823
06:25:32,799 --> 06:25:33,360
and it doesn't happen.

6824
06:25:33,360 --> 06:25:35,680
Or sometimes you just get stuck swinging permanently.

6825
06:25:38,509 --> 06:25:40,439
I really don't have torches.

6826
06:25:40,439 --> 06:25:43,159
This is kind of awful.

6827
06:25:43,159 --> 06:25:45,159
Besides like the gameplay-wise,

6828
06:25:47,099 --> 06:25:48,939
I mean, I would obviously like to see more-

6829
06:25:50,139 --> 06:25:51,419
I really like the PvE stuff.

6830
06:26:00,119 --> 06:26:01,400
I'd like to see Elmo,

6831
06:26:01,400 --> 06:26:05,639
like an officially licensed Elmo boss.

6832
06:26:05,639 --> 06:26:07,770
I don't think that's asking a lot,

6833
06:26:07,770 --> 06:26:09,130
which I mean, a lot of people might think it is.

6834
06:26:10,090 --> 06:26:10,409
What?

6835
06:26:10,409 --> 06:26:11,689
I thought somebody just hit me in the head.

6836
06:26:22,080 --> 06:26:25,180
Pick it up.

6837
06:26:25,180 --> 06:26:26,700
Am I crazy or is this not?

6838
06:26:27,340 --> 06:26:28,380
This coin doesn't exist.

6839
06:26:41,549 --> 06:26:54,279
Get this out of the way right now.

6840
06:27:13,069 --> 06:27:13,470
Heal.

6841
06:27:23,869 --> 06:27:24,189
Anything?

6842
06:27:24,189 --> 06:27:24,830
You got anything?

6843
06:27:24,830 --> 06:27:25,389
Oh, okay.

6844
06:27:25,389 --> 06:27:26,110
I'll take it.

6845
06:27:26,110 --> 06:27:35,659
That's it.

6846
06:27:35,659 --> 06:27:36,459
Oh!

6847
06:27:36,459 --> 06:27:38,139
Oh my God, it scares me every time.

6848
06:27:38,139 --> 06:27:39,419
I swear to God.

6849
06:27:39,419 --> 06:27:41,840
It's good.

6850
06:27:41,840 --> 06:27:51,580
Pick it up.

6851
06:27:52,220 --> 06:27:52,779
The torches.

6852
06:27:52,779 --> 06:27:53,419
Is it gonna do?

6853
06:27:53,419 --> 06:28:04,060
I've got a lot of heals.

6854
06:28:04,060 --> 06:28:07,240
That's why I'm doing this so much.

6855
06:28:07,240 --> 06:28:08,200
Oh shit, I gotta go.

6856
06:28:08,200 --> 06:28:27,840
I think they're above.

6857
06:28:27,840 --> 06:28:44,509
That's a big scary red bug.

6858
06:28:44,509 --> 06:28:47,520
Somebody in here?

6859
06:28:47,520 --> 06:29:09,159
They're up top.

6860
06:29:09,159 --> 06:29:11,229
Oh my God!

6861
06:29:11,229 --> 06:29:12,110
No, fuck.

6862
06:29:12,110 --> 06:29:12,669
I-

6863
06:29:12,669 --> 06:29:13,759
I slowed-

6864
06:29:13,759 --> 06:29:15,290
I fucked up.

6865
06:29:15,290 --> 06:29:17,209
I saw the fucking guy behind him

6866
06:29:17,209 --> 06:29:17,689
and I just-

6867
06:29:17,689 --> 06:29:19,610
I thought that boss was gonna-

6868
06:29:19,610 --> 06:29:22,299
So here's what happened.

6869
06:29:22,299 --> 06:29:24,599
I saw the boss running at him.

6870
06:29:24,599 --> 06:29:26,970
I thought he was gonna back up.

6871
06:29:26,970 --> 06:29:28,970
I didn't think he was gonna just be swinging, swinging, swinging.

6872
06:29:28,970 --> 06:29:30,729
I thought he was gonna back up and get hit by the boss.

6873
06:29:30,729 --> 06:29:33,500
I didn't know.

6874
06:29:33,500 --> 06:29:35,740
He was just walking forward and just clicking.

6875
06:29:35,740 --> 06:29:37,799
I thought he was gonna back up.

6876
06:29:37,799 --> 06:29:38,939
I played that wrong.

6877
06:29:38,939 --> 06:29:42,490
He stopped attacking.

6878
06:29:42,490 --> 06:29:44,220
All right, I do have a complaint.

6879
06:29:44,220 --> 06:29:45,340
Here's a game complaint.

6880
06:29:45,340 --> 06:29:50,939
The dual weld swinging is weird as fuck.

6881
06:29:50,939 --> 06:29:53,419
It's like right click, left click.

6882
06:29:53,419 --> 06:29:54,779
It feels weird.

6883
06:29:54,779 --> 06:29:58,439
There's something about it that just feels off.

6884
06:29:58,439 --> 06:30:01,500
It's like I'll swing twice

6885
06:30:01,500 --> 06:30:03,180
and then try to start my swing combination again

6886
06:30:03,180 --> 06:30:04,729
and just don't do anything.

6887
06:30:04,729 --> 06:30:07,229
It'll be like one, two.

6888
06:30:07,229 --> 06:30:10,189
Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, one, two.

6889
06:30:10,189 --> 06:30:14,409
I'm not doing dual weld anymore.

6890
06:30:14,409 --> 06:30:21,740
The amount of times you have to click with a dual weld,

6891
06:30:21,740 --> 06:30:25,099
it's like left click, right click, right click, left click, right click, left click.

6892
06:30:25,099 --> 06:30:26,540
One of those clicks ain't gonna work.

6893
06:30:26,540 --> 06:30:39,709
You can hold left click.

6894
06:30:39,709 --> 06:30:41,869
Wait, I hold right click or left click?

6895
06:30:41,869 --> 06:30:43,229
Because when I try to do left click,

6896
06:30:43,229 --> 06:30:45,389
it just swings the left hand, doesn't swing the other one.

6897
06:30:45,389 --> 06:30:47,240
Hold down both buttons.

6898
06:30:47,240 --> 06:30:54,909
Hold both left and right at the same time.

6899
06:30:54,909 --> 06:30:55,549
What?

6900
06:30:55,549 --> 06:31:04,880
Hold right click, then hold left click.

6901
06:31:04,880 --> 06:31:08,720
I just wish I could just, I don't know.

6902
06:31:08,720 --> 06:31:12,000
I wish I could just click left click and swing them both.

6903
06:31:12,000 --> 06:31:15,900
Every other weapon in the game is left click.

6904
06:31:15,900 --> 06:31:16,860
Whatever.

6905
06:31:16,860 --> 06:31:18,240
I'm just going with nothing.

6906
06:31:26,029 --> 06:31:45,639
Everything else is a single weapon?

6907
06:31:45,639 --> 06:31:46,439
Yeah.

6908
06:31:46,439 --> 06:31:50,439
It's just finicky to do left click and right click at the same time

6909
06:31:50,439 --> 06:31:53,159
or differently, it just feels weird.

6910
06:31:53,720 --> 06:31:56,029
That's my opinion.

6911
06:31:56,029 --> 06:31:58,909
If you don't like it, then you know what to do.

6912
06:31:58,909 --> 06:32:09,720
I beg you for forgiveness and hoping that you don't hate me.

6913
06:32:40,090 --> 06:32:41,049
It's the next day?

6914
06:32:42,189 --> 06:32:42,909
Yeah.

6915
06:32:42,909 --> 06:32:45,180
I told you this is gonna be an omega stream.

6916
06:32:45,180 --> 06:32:46,139
Oh, I meant it.

6917
06:32:46,139 --> 06:32:55,770
There's a lot of spiders.

6918
06:32:55,770 --> 06:33:16,700
Where is the, okay, right there.

6919
06:33:16,700 --> 06:33:28,779
Eh, do you get no loot for the bugs?

6920
06:33:28,779 --> 06:33:29,500
Like the spiders.

6921
06:33:32,720 --> 06:33:33,840
What the fuck?

6922
06:33:33,840 --> 06:33:34,560
Why?

6923
06:33:34,560 --> 06:33:42,319
This is just kind of a pain in the ass, isn't it?

6924
06:33:42,319 --> 06:33:47,130
Just look at this trail of spiders.

6925
06:33:47,130 --> 06:33:49,529
Let's show how many of these do I have to, just get it.

6926
06:33:50,720 --> 06:33:51,759
God damn it.

6927
06:34:04,939 --> 06:34:05,259
Okay.

6928
06:34:06,669 --> 06:34:07,869
Yeah, that was worth it.

6929
06:34:13,450 --> 06:34:15,159
A lot of experience.

6930
06:34:15,159 --> 06:34:16,279
Oh yeah, that's good.

6931
06:34:16,279 --> 06:34:18,279
Very true.

6932
06:34:18,279 --> 06:34:19,080
Very true.

6933
06:34:19,080 --> 06:34:33,740
I hear somebody.

6934
06:34:33,740 --> 06:34:52,009
I spent so much time killing those spiders.

6935
06:34:52,009 --> 06:35:06,479
Someone's mining in here.

6936
06:35:06,479 --> 06:35:10,400
Sucks, I'm just gonna go across.

6937
06:35:10,400 --> 06:35:14,840
I'm coming to get you.

6938
06:35:14,840 --> 06:35:15,400
I'm coming to get you.

6939
06:35:15,400 --> 06:35:16,200
I'm coming to get you.

6940
06:35:16,200 --> 06:35:38,250
Oh my goodness, look at all this shit in here.

6941
06:35:38,250 --> 06:35:49,799
I got hit by something really awful.

6942
06:35:49,799 --> 06:35:58,669
No heals.

6943
06:35:58,669 --> 06:36:02,729
I want that shit so bad in there.

6944
06:36:02,729 --> 06:36:11,840
I don't know what that means.

6945
06:36:11,840 --> 06:36:13,439
That's not, that's not the crouch crouch.

6946
06:36:13,439 --> 06:36:14,479
I don't know what that means.

6947
06:36:14,479 --> 06:36:18,189
Oh, good.

6948
06:36:18,189 --> 06:36:51,709
Fucking God, how did I fall down before he did?

6949
06:36:51,709 --> 06:37:19,950
Hey, there's a, where is it?

6950
06:37:19,950 --> 06:37:20,669
I just heard it.

6951
06:37:20,669 --> 06:37:32,729
You are decked out.

6952
06:37:32,729 --> 06:37:34,959
Damn, be careful.

6953
06:37:34,959 --> 06:37:54,139
Smart.

6954
06:37:54,139 --> 06:38:42,459
I don't have my heal anymore.

6955
06:38:44,569 --> 06:38:45,930
Okay, if I go up this,

6956
06:38:45,930 --> 06:38:48,139
can I, hopefully I can turn around.

6957
06:38:48,139 --> 06:38:54,200
Whatever, it's worth, who cares?

6958
06:38:54,200 --> 06:38:55,479
No, I'm not going, I'm not doing that.

6959
06:38:55,479 --> 06:38:58,540
I'm not doing that.

6960
06:38:58,540 --> 06:38:59,180
Did he hear me?

6961
06:39:00,139 --> 06:39:13,630
Fuck.

6962
06:39:13,630 --> 06:39:14,270
Oh, okay.

6963
06:39:14,270 --> 06:39:20,250
I guess I'm doing it.

6964
06:39:20,250 --> 06:39:20,970
Where?

6965
06:39:20,970 --> 06:39:23,229
Oh, no.

6966
06:39:24,430 --> 06:39:25,389
No, I don't know.

6967
06:39:25,389 --> 06:39:25,950
I don't know.

6968
06:39:32,380 --> 06:39:33,740
It just spawned.

6969
06:39:33,740 --> 06:39:38,090
This, this two right here.

6970
06:39:38,090 --> 06:39:41,290
What's the, it's got to be some kind of mathematical equation

6971
06:39:41,290 --> 06:39:44,650
where they cannot be like five feet fucking next to each other.

6972
06:39:44,650 --> 06:39:46,810
There has to be some kind of mathematics.

6973
06:39:46,810 --> 06:39:48,650
They get spawning right next to each other.

6974
06:39:49,209 --> 06:40:02,729
It should be at least 50 to a hundred feet apart.

6975
06:40:02,729 --> 06:40:24,569
They spawn within the circles.

6976
06:40:24,569 --> 06:40:26,729
I mean, me and that guy were walking around in circles

6977
06:40:27,049 --> 06:40:28,409
for a full minute or two.

6978
06:40:28,409 --> 06:40:31,689
And the fucking bugleberry over there had two spawn next to him.

6979
06:40:58,279 --> 06:41:03,099
That's life in the dungeon, bro.

6980
06:41:03,099 --> 06:41:03,599
Yeah.

6981
06:41:04,060 --> 06:41:06,439
Oh no, I know.

6982
06:41:06,439 --> 06:41:10,680
Doesn't mean I can't die and just complain about it.

6983
06:41:10,680 --> 06:41:29,080
Do a bugleberry RP.

6984
06:41:31,180 --> 06:41:33,819
I can change class after this.

6985
06:41:40,840 --> 06:41:46,200
Okay, actually getting, this is a, this is a bait coin.

6986
06:41:46,200 --> 06:41:47,580
Been bugged the whole time.

6987
06:41:49,479 --> 06:41:50,919
Oh my goodness.

6988
06:41:50,919 --> 06:42:09,709
What if that was a blue?

6989
06:42:09,709 --> 06:42:10,270
Whatever.

6990
06:42:10,270 --> 06:42:32,299
Okay, this could be good.

6991
06:42:32,299 --> 06:42:38,220
I strafed that.

6992
06:43:27,000 --> 06:43:27,400
What?

6993
06:43:27,959 --> 06:43:31,759
I hit you in the head five fucking times in a row.

6994
06:43:49,790 --> 06:43:50,669
What the heck?

6995
06:43:51,840 --> 06:43:52,959
What the fuck?

6996
06:43:52,959 --> 06:44:00,759
Does my weapon just suck?

6997
06:44:00,759 --> 06:44:01,560
Bad weapon.

6998
06:44:01,560 --> 06:44:06,360
I mean, how many headshots from a 22, what 22 damage?

6999
06:44:06,360 --> 06:44:08,040
Two, four, six, eight, 10.

7000
06:44:08,040 --> 06:44:09,799
I mean, well, that would have to have been a hundred plus.

7001
06:44:09,799 --> 06:44:10,919
How much was that?

7002
06:44:10,919 --> 06:44:22,360
Three potion.

7003
06:44:26,189 --> 06:44:26,430
All right.

7004
06:44:26,430 --> 06:44:30,189
There was at least three or four times in a row where it was like headshot.

7005
06:44:30,439 --> 06:44:31,319
Back up.

7006
06:44:31,319 --> 06:44:32,040
Headshot.

7007
06:44:32,040 --> 06:44:32,919
Back up.

7008
06:44:32,919 --> 06:44:33,799
Headshot.

7009
06:44:33,799 --> 06:44:34,360
Back up.

7010
06:44:34,360 --> 06:44:35,799
I get hit twice and I'm dead.

7011
06:44:35,799 --> 06:44:39,479
God, we, we had the same clothes on.

7012
06:44:39,479 --> 06:44:40,680
We had the same clothing.

7013
06:44:50,639 --> 06:44:52,000
They had the shrine of protection.

7014
06:44:52,880 --> 06:45:02,430
God damn it.

7015
06:45:02,430 --> 06:45:07,319
Oh, I was gonna say something.

7016
06:45:07,319 --> 06:45:07,959
Change class.

7017
06:45:07,959 --> 06:45:09,880
I know, I can't go out on that one.

7018
06:45:09,880 --> 06:45:17,819
I felt really good about that fight too.

7019
06:45:17,819 --> 06:45:34,159
So bandy.

7020
06:45:34,159 --> 06:45:34,639
Goodbye.

7021
06:45:40,560 --> 06:45:42,479
Okay, we're not doing this either.

7022
06:45:42,479 --> 06:45:44,319
I like it.

7023
06:45:44,319 --> 06:45:46,279
I could take one.

7024
06:45:46,279 --> 06:45:48,279
No, I get killed before I open the door.

7025
06:46:02,490 --> 06:46:15,240
Yes, good luck.

7026
06:46:51,900 --> 06:46:55,900
Did you do it?

7027
06:46:55,900 --> 06:47:04,319
Oh my God.

7028
06:47:11,240 --> 06:47:12,840
He's gonna get killed by the fucking mage.

7029
06:47:13,479 --> 06:47:14,520
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

7030
06:47:14,520 --> 06:47:15,020
Just.

7031
06:47:15,880 --> 06:47:22,000
Oh no.

7032
06:47:28,569 --> 06:47:43,069
You actually almost killed me.

7033
06:47:43,069 --> 06:47:44,509
That was actually really well done.

7034
06:47:44,509 --> 06:47:49,000
That was a lot of perseverance.

7035
06:47:49,000 --> 06:47:49,639
Seriously.

7036
06:47:49,639 --> 06:48:04,639
Oh shit.

7037
06:48:04,639 --> 06:48:18,189
I'm just wearing all his clothes.

7038
06:48:18,189 --> 06:48:19,950
Wait, what if I take it and resurrect him?

7039
06:48:19,950 --> 06:48:26,240
Oh, Jack is style.

7040
06:48:26,240 --> 06:48:55,580
Boy, where are you?

7041
06:48:55,580 --> 06:49:00,459
Where is this character?

7042
06:49:00,459 --> 06:49:07,310
I don't, I actually don't see them.

7043
06:49:07,310 --> 06:49:09,159
Where is this?

7044
06:49:09,159 --> 06:49:10,040
Where are they?

7045
06:49:17,150 --> 06:49:18,830
There's no way you.

7046
06:49:18,830 --> 06:49:24,919
There's no way you're shooting me from up there.

7047
06:49:24,919 --> 06:49:27,900
From back there?

7048
06:49:27,900 --> 06:49:30,299
Aiming down and in the hole?

7049
06:49:30,299 --> 06:49:39,770
Dak and daka, you know.

7050
06:49:39,770 --> 06:49:40,810
Why didn't I run?

7051
06:49:40,810 --> 06:49:47,770
Because I wanted to go through that way.

7052
06:49:47,770 --> 06:49:49,369
Dead and bald.

7053
06:49:49,369 --> 06:49:54,840
Class change?

7054
06:49:54,840 --> 06:49:57,689
Yeah, after this.

7055
06:49:57,689 --> 06:49:59,689
Is this game good or are you just bad and make it awful?

7056
06:50:01,150 --> 06:50:03,360
Go download it.

7057
06:50:03,360 --> 06:50:04,240
Go download it.

7058
06:50:04,240 --> 06:50:05,840
Go play it for 45 minutes.

7059
06:50:05,840 --> 06:50:20,220
And then I want you to come back and report on how you did.

7060
06:50:20,220 --> 06:50:22,139
And then play it for like another 100 hours.

7061
06:50:22,139 --> 06:50:25,529
And realize that it's dak and daka.

7062
06:50:25,529 --> 06:50:31,240
Doesn't matter.

7063
06:50:31,240 --> 06:50:33,080
People will just screw you over at every turn.

7064
06:50:33,080 --> 06:50:33,880
People will kill you.

7065
06:50:33,880 --> 06:50:37,419
People will try to be friends with you and then backstab you.

7066
06:50:37,419 --> 06:50:42,060
People might lock you in a room with a bunch of monsters.

7067
06:50:42,060 --> 06:50:44,680
And then, you know, it's dak and daka.

7068
06:51:01,500 --> 06:51:04,060
But you died by standing under an archer on purpose.

7069
06:51:04,060 --> 06:51:09,209
See that?

7070
06:51:09,209 --> 06:51:26,909
I thought he was dead.

7071
06:51:26,909 --> 06:51:29,229
You have to seriously block me in here with all this.

7072
06:51:29,229 --> 06:52:16,520
I was going to say, there's a lot of shit in here.

7073
06:52:16,520 --> 06:52:17,159
Hold on.

7074
06:52:17,159 --> 06:52:33,450
Now we're talking.

7075
06:52:33,450 --> 06:52:49,279
Did I loot this already?

7076
06:52:49,279 --> 06:53:11,560
I'm going to stay up.

7077
06:53:11,560 --> 06:53:51,099
Oh shit.

7078
06:53:51,099 --> 06:53:52,509
Oh, yup.

7079
06:53:52,509 --> 06:53:59,930
People are coming and I don't want to do well.

7080
06:53:59,930 --> 06:54:04,009
I'll have you.

7081
06:54:04,009 --> 06:54:06,520
Hold down right click.

7082
06:54:06,520 --> 06:54:08,119
Hold down right click and left click.

7083
06:54:08,119 --> 06:54:22,169
What is with this barrel?

7084
06:54:25,310 --> 06:54:25,950
Hey.

7085
06:54:25,950 --> 06:54:29,930
Hey, what's up?

7086
06:54:29,930 --> 06:54:33,979
Do you have any shielding?

7087
06:54:35,259 --> 06:54:35,979
Let me check.

7088
06:54:35,979 --> 06:54:46,909
Sorry, I do not.

7089
06:54:46,909 --> 06:54:47,470
I would have.

7090
06:54:47,470 --> 06:54:48,430
I would have given it to you.

7091
06:54:48,430 --> 06:54:48,990
I promise you.

7092
06:54:48,990 --> 06:55:01,759
I'll stick with you, dude.

7093
06:55:01,759 --> 06:55:05,479
I don't know how to play the gun.

7094
06:55:05,479 --> 06:55:06,599
It's very hard.

7095
06:55:06,599 --> 06:55:07,639
It is no joke.

7096
06:55:07,639 --> 06:55:12,009
I've done high roller twice.

7097
06:55:12,009 --> 06:55:14,590
And I've lived times.

7098
06:55:14,590 --> 06:55:17,869
And I don't think I've lived once during this fucking cave.

7099
06:55:17,869 --> 06:55:20,459
So be careful.

7100
06:55:20,459 --> 06:55:22,139
People are known to double cross each other here.

7101
06:55:22,139 --> 06:55:24,139
Especially if they say they're a friend at first.

7102
06:55:24,139 --> 06:55:25,689
Goodbye, dude.

7103
06:55:27,049 --> 06:55:29,099
See, I told you about this spider.

7104
06:55:29,099 --> 06:55:30,700
You know, I'm not going to double cross.

7105
06:55:30,700 --> 06:55:32,860
I'm going to die.

7106
06:55:37,159 --> 06:55:38,360
That was a little rusty.

7107
06:55:38,360 --> 06:55:39,240
I'm a little rusty.

7108
06:55:39,240 --> 06:55:40,279
All right, let's move.

7109
06:55:40,279 --> 06:55:44,810
Look, man, I know there's a pot of spiders back here.

7110
06:55:44,810 --> 06:55:45,529
That's all I know.

7111
06:55:49,799 --> 06:55:50,439
We need light.

7112
06:55:51,080 --> 06:55:51,639
We need light.

7113
06:55:53,080 --> 06:55:57,259
Why are there so many?

7114
06:55:57,259 --> 06:55:59,259
This is like, where's the spawner?

7115
06:55:59,259 --> 06:55:59,979
Is there like 10 of them?

7116
06:56:03,040 --> 06:56:04,000
Pot of spiders.

7117
06:56:04,000 --> 06:56:05,119
You need to, oh, good job.

7118
06:56:05,119 --> 06:56:05,919
All right, let's get out of here.

7119
06:56:05,919 --> 06:56:06,080
Come on.

7120
06:56:06,080 --> 06:56:07,119
Yeah, we got to get out of here.

7121
06:56:14,919 --> 06:56:15,560
Shit.

7122
06:56:15,560 --> 06:56:16,279
Hey, get in here.

7123
06:56:16,279 --> 06:56:16,759
Get in here.

7124
06:56:17,479 --> 06:56:18,919
My buddy told me about this door.

7125
06:56:20,270 --> 06:56:23,310
I present to you Golgotha.

7126
06:56:24,029 --> 06:56:26,279
You think we can take him?

7127
06:56:29,759 --> 06:56:30,880
You think we can do it?

7128
06:56:30,880 --> 06:56:31,599
You got good gear?

7129
06:56:32,240 --> 06:56:33,659
Nope.

7130
06:56:33,659 --> 06:56:34,619
But it's too late now.

7131
06:56:36,479 --> 06:56:37,119
He can't make it.

7132
06:56:42,400 --> 06:56:48,080
OK, I'm sorry you didn't make it.

7133
06:56:48,080 --> 06:56:49,520
I don't know if we were prepared for this.

7134
06:56:57,740 --> 06:56:58,779
This is like a boss.

7135
06:56:59,419 --> 06:57:07,659
All right, I got to get out of here now.

7136
06:57:07,659 --> 06:57:08,700
I think I'm just dead.

7137
06:57:08,700 --> 06:57:11,849
Is there another way to get out?

7138
06:57:11,849 --> 06:57:13,130
No, I have to run.

7139
06:57:13,130 --> 06:57:16,240
I'm stuck.

7140
06:57:17,040 --> 06:57:17,919
What is going on?

7141
06:57:20,619 --> 06:57:23,049
Let me fucking out of here.

7142
06:57:23,849 --> 06:57:30,400
Where is it?

7143
06:57:30,959 --> 06:57:31,439
Where is it?

7144
06:57:32,000 --> 06:57:36,439
Where is it?

7145
06:57:36,439 --> 06:57:53,400
It's up top.

7146
06:57:54,680 --> 06:57:55,959
I'm dead.

7147
06:57:55,959 --> 06:58:00,000
I don't know.

7148
06:58:00,000 --> 06:58:01,439
I have no idea where it is.

7149
06:58:01,439 --> 06:58:03,599
We're in a lot of trouble.

7150
06:58:03,599 --> 06:58:05,840
Yeah, I don't have very much help though.

7151
06:58:05,840 --> 06:58:30,909
Will another one spawn in the circle?

7152
06:58:30,909 --> 06:58:32,750
Got to make a choice and go.

7153
06:58:32,750 --> 06:58:34,299
I got to make a choice here.

7154
06:58:34,299 --> 06:58:35,659
Yeah, we got to make a choice.

7155
06:58:35,659 --> 06:58:36,459
I got to make a choice.

7156
06:58:36,939 --> 06:58:38,139
I don't know how to go up though.

7157
06:58:38,139 --> 06:58:39,020
I don't know where I am.

7158
06:58:39,020 --> 06:58:39,819
I don't know where to go.

7159
06:58:39,819 --> 06:58:41,290
Do you know how to go up?

7160
06:58:41,290 --> 06:58:49,340
I just don't know the layout.

7161
06:58:49,340 --> 06:58:51,369
Like this way?

7162
06:58:51,369 --> 06:58:53,919
Oh, we're dead.

7163
06:58:53,919 --> 06:58:54,400
Map?

7164
06:58:54,400 --> 06:59:02,919
I don't even know what up looks like.

7165
06:59:02,919 --> 06:59:04,279
No, I'm dead if I go that way.

7166
06:59:04,279 --> 06:59:06,889
I'm dead.

7167
06:59:06,889 --> 06:59:08,459
There's nowhere to go.

7168
06:59:08,459 --> 06:59:09,900
I wouldn't have made it.

7169
06:59:09,900 --> 06:59:21,419
Were there any left?

7170
06:59:21,419 --> 06:59:22,380
I think somebody got it.

7171
06:59:22,380 --> 06:59:27,130
I just don't...

7172
06:59:27,130 --> 06:59:31,119
The amount of levels that are in this zone,

7173
06:59:31,119 --> 06:59:34,119
I feel like a handful of people just get screwed

7174
06:59:34,119 --> 06:59:38,380
because they're not on the right level when the shit spawns.

7175
06:59:38,380 --> 06:59:39,799
And it's like if I don't have health,

7176
06:59:39,959 --> 06:59:40,439
I'm just...

7177
06:59:40,439 --> 06:59:42,200
I'll just die.

7178
06:59:42,200 --> 06:59:52,000
Go back to the side ramp where you got to the troll.

7179
06:59:52,000 --> 06:59:52,720
I just...

7180
06:59:52,720 --> 07:00:03,790
Yeah.

7181
07:00:03,790 --> 07:00:07,150
Guaranteed extract on here is represented by the stairs symbol.

7182
07:00:07,150 --> 07:00:26,509
It means the stone's collapsing earlier.

7183
07:00:26,509 --> 07:00:28,669
The rock slide is a secret escape.

7184
07:00:28,669 --> 07:00:30,380
Really?

7185
07:00:30,380 --> 07:00:38,520
I thought that person went in there and got crushed by the rocks.

7186
07:00:38,520 --> 07:00:58,619
The rock slide means only one can come out.

7187
07:00:58,619 --> 07:00:59,580
You know what it is to me?

7188
07:00:59,580 --> 07:01:03,159
It's just kind of getting that object permanence

7189
07:01:03,159 --> 07:01:05,930
of just where everything is on the map.

7190
07:01:05,930 --> 07:01:08,090
That's always been hard for me to do.

7191
07:01:08,090 --> 07:01:10,799
Because to me, those...

7192
07:01:10,799 --> 07:01:14,090
All those hallways are just the same hallway in my brain.

7193
07:01:14,090 --> 07:01:15,529
It's just the same hallway.

7194
07:01:15,529 --> 07:01:17,869
It's just like a shredded up piece of paper.

7195
07:01:17,869 --> 07:01:18,430
I don't even...

7196
07:01:18,430 --> 07:01:19,150
I can't even...

7197
07:01:19,150 --> 07:01:20,349
My brain can't translate it.

7198
07:01:29,240 --> 07:01:30,119
I think I'm dead already.

7199
07:01:32,990 --> 07:01:36,319
Okay, bye.

7200
07:01:37,040 --> 07:01:37,759
Bye, I guess.

7201
07:02:10,590 --> 07:02:11,310
Light orb.

7202
07:02:12,349 --> 07:02:15,130
I want chain lightning.

7203
07:02:15,130 --> 07:02:16,330
Zap is kind of bad.

7204
07:02:16,330 --> 07:02:22,479
Fireball, magic missile, lightning strike.

7205
07:02:24,750 --> 07:02:25,549
Haste is good.

7206
07:02:26,569 --> 07:02:27,049
Slow is...

7207
07:02:27,930 --> 07:02:29,049
I think slow would be good too.

7208
07:02:29,849 --> 07:02:31,130
Use it on people and run away.

7209
07:02:31,130 --> 07:02:35,500
Try this.

7210
07:02:36,299 --> 07:02:38,060
I really have no idea what I'm doing, but I'll try.

7211
07:03:12,799 --> 07:03:14,240
Ouchie, ouchies.

7212
07:03:14,240 --> 07:03:35,099
MOU using the lobby is consumed.

7213
07:03:35,099 --> 07:03:36,650
Oh, that sucks.

7214
07:03:36,650 --> 07:03:37,770
Okay, well, oops.

7215
07:03:42,540 --> 07:03:43,419
That's funny.

7216
07:03:43,419 --> 07:04:09,099
Oh, I got a thing or two to learn.

7217
07:04:09,099 --> 07:04:10,060
Shit, that's a lot.

7218
07:04:10,060 --> 07:04:11,180
Oh my god, that's a lot.

7219
07:04:11,180 --> 07:04:12,380
I'm just going to hide and leave.

7220
07:04:12,380 --> 07:04:14,360
I'm going to...

7221
07:04:14,360 --> 07:04:16,119
Okay, I'm going to sprint to the middle right now.

7222
07:04:16,119 --> 07:04:28,240
I'll have enough to buy another purple.

7223
07:04:28,240 --> 07:04:28,720
Rock slide?

7224
07:04:28,720 --> 07:04:50,970
Where is the rock slide?

7225
07:04:50,970 --> 07:04:51,689
Oh, come on.

7226
07:04:51,689 --> 07:05:19,770
Fuck you.

7227
07:05:51,950 --> 07:05:52,270
Fuck!

7228
07:05:52,990 --> 07:05:54,189
Okay, it's kind of fun.

7229
07:05:54,189 --> 07:05:55,549
It's kind of fun, but I got...

7230
07:05:55,549 --> 07:05:56,909
I had to fight like three enemies

7231
07:05:56,909 --> 07:05:59,229
and I fucked up and I blew myself up in the first two seconds.

7232
07:05:59,229 --> 07:06:11,869
I was thinking like slow him

7233
07:06:11,869 --> 07:06:13,310
and then maybe get him with a magic missile.

7234
07:06:13,310 --> 07:06:14,270
I don't know.

7235
07:06:14,270 --> 07:06:15,630
Haste always first.

7236
07:06:15,630 --> 07:06:18,319
Can I cast it on myself?

7237
07:06:18,319 --> 07:06:25,840
What do you got on you?

7238
07:06:25,840 --> 07:06:30,680
Nice...

7239
07:06:30,680 --> 07:06:33,930
Oh, nice duck.

7240
07:06:33,930 --> 07:06:35,369
Haste then invis.

7241
07:06:35,369 --> 07:06:44,959
Yeah, you can give buffs to enemies.

7242
07:06:44,959 --> 07:06:45,840
That's true.

7243
07:06:45,840 --> 07:06:47,209
I've actually seen it happen.

7244
07:06:47,209 --> 07:06:50,479
You're yelling a lot.

7245
07:06:50,479 --> 07:06:55,229
Oak is a good mage.

7246
07:06:55,229 --> 07:06:59,080
You can probably give some pointers.

7247
07:06:59,080 --> 07:06:59,799
Maybe, yeah.

7248
07:06:59,799 --> 07:07:05,360
It's happened to my buddy Eric.

7249
07:07:05,360 --> 07:07:07,400
Oh, shit.

7250
07:07:07,400 --> 07:07:19,950
Buddy Eric died, nice.

7251
07:07:27,580 --> 07:07:28,700
Did I do it?

7252
07:07:28,700 --> 07:07:29,900
Okay, I did it.

7253
07:07:29,900 --> 07:08:07,840
Fuck, that's a long lead time.

7254
07:08:07,919 --> 07:08:13,950
What is happening?

7255
07:08:13,950 --> 07:08:15,950
Oh, they're homing missiles, kind of.

7256
07:08:15,950 --> 07:08:22,650
Is that for me?

7257
07:08:22,650 --> 07:08:42,750
Move speed, weapon damage.

7258
07:08:42,750 --> 07:08:44,590
Wait, does it actually count as a staff?

7259
07:08:44,590 --> 07:08:55,529
Like can I use it as a staff?

7260
07:08:55,529 --> 07:08:56,650
What's the meditate button?

7261
07:08:56,650 --> 07:09:05,529
This is very dangerous.

7262
07:09:05,529 --> 07:09:55,759
Oh, fuck.

7263
07:09:55,759 --> 07:09:58,000
Oh, I didn't know what to do.

7264
07:09:58,000 --> 07:10:12,880
I feel like I was just dead no matter what there.

7265
07:10:12,880 --> 07:10:16,169
Use invisibility and run.

7266
07:10:16,169 --> 07:10:17,529
I should probably put that on.

7267
07:10:17,529 --> 07:10:18,970
You cast haste on him?

7268
07:10:18,970 --> 07:10:20,619
That wasn't slow?

7269
07:10:20,619 --> 07:10:33,880
That was definitely slow.

7270
07:10:33,880 --> 07:10:38,750
Wizard is really hard to play on the Goblin map.

7271
07:10:38,750 --> 07:10:40,919
I feel like Wizard's probably really hard to play

7272
07:10:40,919 --> 07:10:41,880
on any map.

7273
07:10:41,880 --> 07:10:45,740
And you just really need to learn how to play and get good.

7274
07:10:45,740 --> 07:10:47,419
But yes, I do agree.

7275
07:10:47,419 --> 07:10:50,569
This is probably a bad place to try to learn how to play Wizard.

7276
07:10:50,569 --> 07:11:04,360
If I just, okay.

7277
07:11:04,360 --> 07:11:05,880
So is that always on me?

7278
07:11:05,880 --> 07:11:06,840
It is, all right.

7279
07:11:06,840 --> 07:11:23,639
I just missed every single shot.

7280
07:11:23,639 --> 07:11:24,360
I thought I was homing.

7281
07:11:42,270 --> 07:12:13,500
Oh, shoot.

7282
07:12:25,959 --> 07:12:28,799
Okay, that's pretty fun.

7283
07:12:28,799 --> 07:12:46,700
I need, okay, I need to meditate somewhere.

7284
07:12:46,700 --> 07:12:50,759
I'm gonna do it here, who cares?

7285
07:12:50,759 --> 07:12:53,580
You almost chain lightning to yourself.

7286
07:12:53,580 --> 07:12:54,939
That can happen, that's true.

7287
07:12:54,939 --> 07:13:10,840
Like everything, kind of.

7288
07:13:10,840 --> 07:13:12,040
All right, what about anything?

7289
07:13:12,040 --> 07:14:02,319
I need to meditate again.

7290
07:14:02,319 --> 07:14:08,430
Is it going on?

7291
07:14:08,430 --> 07:14:22,970
Is there a way to get spells back better than this?

7292
07:14:22,970 --> 07:14:26,169
Or you just have to do, you just have to get, okay.

7293
07:14:26,169 --> 07:14:27,130
That's not too bad.

7294
07:14:27,130 --> 07:14:36,750
I think there's a portal underneath me.

7295
07:14:36,750 --> 07:14:38,569
I saw a bunch of blue.

7296
07:15:04,509 --> 07:15:09,049
Whatever, don't cast that.

7297
07:15:09,049 --> 07:15:10,520
Oh, fuck.

7298
07:15:10,520 --> 07:15:12,919
Oh no, I didn't see this.

7299
07:15:12,919 --> 07:15:38,040
I just need to get out of here.

7300
07:15:38,040 --> 07:15:56,060
If you get out with some gold, Alchemist sells spell books.

7301
07:15:56,060 --> 07:15:58,830
True, I'm gonna try to get out though.

7302
07:15:58,830 --> 07:16:10,400
I have nothing to do with this shit.

7303
07:16:10,400 --> 07:16:16,860
Oh, this is ugly.

7304
07:16:16,860 --> 07:16:19,419
Look at all these fucking spiders.

7305
07:16:19,419 --> 07:16:32,040
Oh, come on, man.

7306
07:16:38,319 --> 07:16:44,759
Oh my God, there's shit everywhere.

7307
07:16:44,759 --> 07:16:45,720
What killed me?

7308
07:16:45,720 --> 07:16:47,159
A trap on the ground.

7309
07:16:47,159 --> 07:16:50,000
It's so stressful.

7310
07:16:50,000 --> 07:16:51,759
I juked so many people there

7311
07:16:51,759 --> 07:16:54,080
and a trap on the ground is pitch black.

7312
07:16:54,080 --> 07:17:04,430
I was the last player too.

7313
07:17:04,430 --> 07:17:12,799
I feel like I'd rather go against groups

7314
07:17:12,799 --> 07:17:14,810
than any of the PvE.

7315
07:17:16,250 --> 07:17:18,349
I feel like I just, when you run out of spells,

7316
07:17:18,349 --> 07:17:19,790
you kind of just in trouble.

7317
07:17:19,790 --> 07:17:30,169
Crystal Sword is good.

7318
07:17:30,169 --> 07:17:33,310
You can always buy one too.

7319
07:17:33,310 --> 07:17:36,119
Drink some water.

7320
07:17:36,119 --> 07:17:37,799
I got a big, big water right here.

7321
07:17:37,799 --> 07:18:18,599
I'm good to go.

7322
07:18:18,599 --> 07:18:21,000
One, you're gonna let one bug kill you, man.

7323
07:18:48,799 --> 07:18:49,840
Come on, what's this?

7324
07:18:59,259 --> 07:19:01,020
How did I end up in the same corner?

7325
07:19:01,020 --> 07:19:03,450
How did I end up in the same corner?

7326
07:19:03,450 --> 07:19:24,779
Oh, it's because you're red.

7327
07:19:24,779 --> 07:19:26,139
Okay, I get it.

7328
07:19:26,139 --> 07:19:40,560
I didn't want to do that.

7329
07:19:40,560 --> 07:20:24,040
Did that waste a spell?

7330
07:20:24,040 --> 07:20:34,040
Get off that!

7331
07:20:34,040 --> 07:20:35,240
That, I was so far away.

7332
07:20:35,240 --> 07:20:37,880
That goes very, oh, don't breathe that.

7333
07:20:37,880 --> 07:20:49,400
That goes really far.

7334
07:20:49,400 --> 07:20:51,000
Water makes it go farther.

7335
07:20:51,000 --> 07:20:58,680
Very good to know.

7336
07:20:58,680 --> 07:20:59,159
Thank you.

7337
07:21:03,200 --> 07:21:05,680
You're in the worst possible spot you could be in.

7338
07:21:05,680 --> 07:21:26,970
I want to just get out and make a little bit of money.

7339
07:21:26,970 --> 07:21:31,599
Hey, I'm showing my friends at college your stream.

7340
07:21:31,599 --> 07:21:32,560
Can you say something funny?

7341
07:21:35,740 --> 07:21:40,779
All of you in the room right now, go do your homework.

7342
07:21:40,779 --> 07:21:43,740
If you already did, good for you.

7343
07:21:43,740 --> 07:21:46,970
You should eat Cheetos.

7344
07:21:46,970 --> 07:21:49,869
You should split a bag of Cheetos.

7345
07:21:49,869 --> 07:21:51,150
Not one bag each of you.

7346
07:21:51,150 --> 07:21:52,189
Split a bag of Cheetos.

7347
07:21:52,189 --> 07:21:53,630
It's battening shit.

7348
07:21:53,630 --> 07:22:16,639
Hey, what was that?

7349
07:22:19,000 --> 07:22:20,919
Where did, what happened here?

7350
07:22:20,919 --> 07:22:22,439
That was very strange.

7351
07:22:22,439 --> 07:22:24,360
Very strange, very strange.

7352
07:22:25,560 --> 07:22:26,919
They went through the ceiling.

7353
07:22:29,000 --> 07:22:33,479
What?

7354
07:22:33,479 --> 07:22:34,759
Hold on, what happened?

7355
07:22:34,759 --> 07:22:36,119
Was he behind the pillar?

7356
07:22:47,529 --> 07:22:49,369
I heard footsteps, footsteps, footsteps.

7357
07:22:49,369 --> 07:22:51,610
And then he was above you and jumped down.

7358
07:22:56,729 --> 07:22:58,330
This is not the kind of class I can play.

7359
07:22:59,209 --> 07:23:02,840
It's too much like micromanagement.

7360
07:23:02,840 --> 07:23:04,759
Picking up items, like going like this.

7361
07:23:04,759 --> 07:23:05,400
I'm like, what spell is this?

7362
07:23:05,400 --> 07:23:06,759
I don't know how to do this one.

7363
07:23:06,759 --> 07:23:09,180
And then attack and then meditate.

7364
07:23:09,180 --> 07:23:10,060
Someone's going to just going to,

7365
07:23:10,060 --> 07:23:11,259
I'm literally going to be tunnel vision.

7366
07:23:11,259 --> 07:23:12,860
Someone's going to jump down and axe me in the head.

7367
07:23:12,860 --> 07:23:23,389
Why do that when a barbarian can hit you in the head

7368
07:23:23,389 --> 07:23:24,509
and kill you in two hits?

7369
07:23:24,509 --> 07:23:38,299
Better for when you're in a group.

7370
07:23:38,299 --> 07:23:46,439
I've actually seen some cracked out wizard gameplay.

7371
07:23:46,439 --> 07:23:50,200
I watched Moon Moon play with wizard for a little bit.

7372
07:23:50,759 --> 07:23:54,430
And he was so unbelievably good.

7373
07:23:54,430 --> 07:23:55,549
I thought he was hacking.

7374
07:23:58,029 --> 07:23:59,229
It was like, he was just like,

7375
07:24:02,270 --> 07:24:04,189
he like killed six people at one point in a row.

7376
07:24:04,750 --> 07:24:06,349
And I was just like, holy shit.

7377
07:24:07,470 --> 07:24:08,590
He's so good.

7378
07:24:08,590 --> 07:24:09,630
How do you get that good?

7379
07:24:11,470 --> 07:24:33,819
It was mind boggling.

7380
07:24:33,819 --> 07:24:35,340
Get this fucking shit off my screen.

7381
07:24:35,340 --> 07:24:37,400
I can't play wizard.

7382
07:24:48,119 --> 07:24:50,840
I actually could see how this would be like in a group.

7383
07:24:55,119 --> 07:24:57,279
Standing still in this game for more than a second or two

7384
07:24:57,279 --> 07:24:59,979
is just, I just, I feel naked.

7385
07:24:59,979 --> 07:25:18,119
I'm like already dead too.

7386
07:25:18,119 --> 07:25:19,709
Oh God, fuck that.

7387
07:25:19,709 --> 07:25:20,990
I've got nothing to do with this.

7388
07:25:29,209 --> 07:25:29,930
Your loot sucks.

7389
07:25:29,930 --> 07:25:30,889
You may as well be.

7390
07:25:31,770 --> 07:25:50,830
Please don't kill me.

7391
07:25:50,830 --> 07:25:51,790
Please don't kill me.

7392
07:25:51,790 --> 07:25:52,290
Please.

7393
07:25:53,630 --> 07:26:18,360
I'll try this one more time.

7394
07:26:18,360 --> 07:26:19,880
But I need to play in a group.

7395
07:26:19,880 --> 07:26:23,229
You can fireball the door.

7396
07:26:23,229 --> 07:26:24,430
Oh shit, I didn't know that.

7397
07:26:24,430 --> 07:26:42,430
Please try rogue.

7398
07:26:42,430 --> 07:26:44,919
I'll play rogue next time I play.

7399
07:26:44,919 --> 07:26:45,720
Next time I stream.

7400
07:26:45,720 --> 07:26:47,000
I'm streaming this on Friday.

7401
07:26:47,000 --> 07:26:54,090
Friday will be rogue day.

7402
07:26:54,090 --> 07:27:01,229
Let me at least try to get

7403
07:27:01,229 --> 07:27:03,470
at least somewhat anything going with this character.

7404
07:27:03,470 --> 07:27:25,389
I just made fucking popcorn.

7405
07:27:25,389 --> 07:27:26,430
Anybody want some?

7406
07:27:26,430 --> 07:27:41,840
Go back to, so bad.

7407
07:27:41,840 --> 07:27:43,840
Yeah, I got, I don't, I gotta learn,

7408
07:27:43,840 --> 07:27:46,000
I gotta learn how to play with this character.

7409
07:27:46,000 --> 07:27:49,360
I've played, almost every moment of my time

7410
07:27:49,360 --> 07:27:51,389
has been on fighter.

7411
07:27:51,389 --> 07:27:53,389
I'm like holding right click to block.

7412
07:27:53,389 --> 07:27:55,869
It's been like 15 hours on one character.

7413
07:27:55,869 --> 07:28:26,970
What did you eat for breakfast?

7414
07:28:26,970 --> 07:28:37,360
Two ovaries, the eggs.

7415
07:28:37,360 --> 07:28:40,520
Early game, no gear wizard.

7416
07:28:40,520 --> 07:28:43,159
I feel like if I, if I, I feel like I can't engage.

7417
07:28:43,240 --> 07:28:45,529
I have to stop engaging enemies.

7418
07:28:45,529 --> 07:28:47,290
Only if there's like one or two.

7419
07:28:47,290 --> 07:28:49,759
You can't just like walk around.

7420
07:28:49,759 --> 07:29:01,130
I have to get out at least once.

7421
07:29:01,130 --> 07:29:05,900
They have to be really far away too.

7422
07:29:05,900 --> 07:29:07,180
I keep walking.

7423
07:29:07,180 --> 07:29:07,979
Oh, there's enemies.

7424
07:29:07,979 --> 07:29:09,340
I'm gonna cast my spells right here.

7425
07:29:09,340 --> 07:29:11,500
And they're as far away as the fucking torches.

7426
07:29:11,500 --> 07:29:12,590
They're just dead.

7427
07:29:12,590 --> 07:29:49,419
Okay, anything else?

7428
07:29:49,419 --> 07:29:55,419
I think the fire on the ground.

7429
07:29:56,139 --> 07:30:21,819
I can't believe you actually hit me.

7430
07:30:21,819 --> 07:30:22,459
That's weird.

7431
07:30:22,459 --> 07:30:31,580
I feel like you shouldn't have.

7432
07:30:31,580 --> 07:30:32,459
No, don't.

7433
07:30:32,459 --> 07:30:44,970
Water sap is strong.

7434
07:30:46,279 --> 07:31:02,919
Magic missile seems really, really good.

7435
07:31:02,919 --> 07:31:04,439
Oh, that was unfortunate.

7436
07:31:04,439 --> 07:31:20,569
What the hell just happened?

7437
07:31:20,569 --> 07:31:22,700
Was that a player?

7438
07:31:26,799 --> 07:31:28,720
Oh, I'm so fucking in trouble here.

7439
07:31:34,169 --> 07:31:37,290
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

7440
07:31:42,159 --> 07:31:42,560
What?

7441
07:31:42,560 --> 07:31:44,240
Why is, what is going on?

7442
07:31:44,240 --> 07:31:46,000
This skeleton's a barbarian?

7443
07:31:47,119 --> 07:31:47,919
What?

7444
07:31:47,919 --> 07:31:49,119
What's happening?

7445
07:31:49,119 --> 07:31:50,639
He's, oh, he's got the skin.

7446
07:31:50,639 --> 07:31:52,400
I thought he was a fucking NPC.

7447
07:31:56,270 --> 07:31:56,590
What?

7448
07:31:57,310 --> 07:32:03,819
I thought he was one of the skeletons in this room.

7449
07:32:03,819 --> 07:32:06,779
And when he started just chasing me like crazy and throwing bombs.

7450
07:32:06,779 --> 07:32:21,279
And I was like, what's happening?

7451
07:32:21,279 --> 07:32:28,330
They all have it?

7452
07:32:28,330 --> 07:32:28,970
Damn.

7453
07:32:28,970 --> 07:32:29,529
Okay.

7454
07:32:29,529 --> 07:32:31,279
Oops.

7455
07:32:31,520 --> 07:32:44,479
I didn't mean to exit the whole game.

7456
07:32:44,479 --> 07:32:47,709
I'm going to do three more.

7457
07:32:47,709 --> 07:33:13,950
Three more and I'll play Rogue.

7458
07:33:13,950 --> 07:33:14,830
Bloody mouth.

7459
07:33:14,830 --> 07:33:20,919
How does this work?

7460
07:33:20,919 --> 07:33:26,380
Let's find out.

7461
07:33:26,380 --> 07:33:27,180
Lockpick.

7462
07:33:27,180 --> 07:33:33,389
The next successful attack causes the target to bleed

7463
07:33:33,389 --> 07:33:39,759
because this is the bleed and this is stealth.

7464
07:33:39,759 --> 07:33:46,799
Okay.

7465
07:33:46,799 --> 07:34:03,319
If you're hiding, you can move 10 steps.

7466
07:34:03,319 --> 07:34:17,819
Let's give it a go.

7467
07:34:17,819 --> 07:34:18,779
Yeah, I'll do three more.

7468
07:34:18,779 --> 07:34:19,580
Only three more.

7469
07:34:19,580 --> 07:34:22,509
I want to, I don't know how to overdo it.

7470
07:34:22,509 --> 07:34:35,040
This does not have a right click.

7471
07:34:35,040 --> 07:34:38,000
That's, now if I stab, it's going to be poison.

7472
07:34:39,200 --> 07:34:42,090
Let's try it on somebody.

7473
07:34:42,090 --> 07:34:42,409
Okay.

7474
07:34:42,409 --> 07:34:55,080
Three more.

7475
07:34:55,080 --> 07:34:57,720
So how to, biting NPCs.

7476
07:34:57,720 --> 07:35:03,049
PVE.

7477
07:35:03,049 --> 07:35:05,290
Run around, dodge and stuff.

7478
07:35:05,290 --> 07:35:21,979
Press the wrong button.

7479
07:35:21,979 --> 07:35:22,779
That's poison.

7480
07:35:22,779 --> 07:35:24,380
Is there anyone to tell if it's ticking?

7481
07:35:24,380 --> 07:35:26,139
Or is it just on them?

7482
07:35:37,340 --> 07:35:39,180
I just have to assume that it's on, right?

7483
07:35:39,180 --> 07:35:56,330
It's fun.

7484
07:35:56,330 --> 07:36:04,000
Let me try this.

7485
07:36:04,000 --> 07:36:05,209
So I'm, all right.

7486
07:36:05,209 --> 07:36:06,810
So I'm invisible right now.

7487
07:36:06,810 --> 07:36:08,090
So I can go one.

7488
07:36:08,090 --> 07:36:09,209
Wait, I thought I could walk.

7489
07:36:09,209 --> 07:36:12,990
I thought I could do 10 steps.

7490
07:36:17,549 --> 07:36:18,509
Oh, it's only while crouching.

7491
07:36:18,509 --> 07:36:19,009
Okay.

7492
07:36:30,759 --> 07:36:32,040
Well, I'm just dead.

7493
07:36:35,599 --> 07:36:39,049
We're, god, dude.

7494
07:36:39,049 --> 07:36:40,330
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

7495
07:36:40,330 --> 07:36:40,830
No.

7496
07:36:42,720 --> 07:36:43,200
No, yeah.

7497
07:36:43,200 --> 07:36:43,520
Listen.

7498
07:36:43,520 --> 07:36:44,400
Listen to him.

7499
07:36:44,400 --> 07:36:44,900
No.

7500
07:36:51,020 --> 07:36:51,659
Help me.

7501
07:36:51,659 --> 07:36:52,459
Help me just go.

7502
07:36:53,659 --> 07:36:54,159
Help me.

7503
07:36:54,939 --> 07:36:55,439
Help.

7504
07:36:57,099 --> 07:36:58,380
Everyone in this room is going to die.

7505
07:36:58,939 --> 07:37:00,139
Everybody in this room is going to die.

7506
07:37:00,139 --> 07:37:00,779
I'm just saying.

7507
07:37:02,250 --> 07:37:04,090
Like this, they're not going to make it out of this.

7508
07:37:18,380 --> 07:37:40,990
There's so many people.

7509
07:37:40,990 --> 07:37:42,590
I hit exit game again.

7510
07:37:42,590 --> 07:37:43,310
Oh my god.

7511
07:37:43,310 --> 07:37:44,750
I'm just getting fucking tired now.

7512
07:37:49,799 --> 07:37:50,599
Shit.

7513
07:37:50,599 --> 07:38:10,430
Somebody saying I'm not doing poison.

7514
07:38:10,430 --> 07:38:23,630
I think I am.

7515
07:38:23,630 --> 07:38:27,700
Rupture?

7516
07:38:29,599 --> 07:38:41,040
Oh, wait a minute. That's not poison. Wait. Poisoned weapon.

7517
07:38:41,040 --> 07:38:46,189
Mmm.

7518
07:38:46,189 --> 07:39:00,099
So this is just a bleed. Bleed and poison stacked. They stack together, I'm imagining, right?

7519
07:39:00,099 --> 07:39:03,799
Yeah, there we go. Okay.

7520
07:39:03,799 --> 07:39:21,319
Alright, two more.

7521
07:39:21,319 --> 07:39:32,959
Why are we resorting to violence?

7522
07:39:32,959 --> 07:39:35,919
You gotta do three more and one comedy run.

7523
07:39:35,919 --> 07:39:57,549
Hmm. We'll see. She knows.

7524
07:39:57,549 --> 07:40:10,880
Bro sucks.

7525
07:40:10,880 --> 07:40:24,189
That's a horrible room.

7526
07:40:24,189 --> 07:40:29,639
I'm friendly.

7527
07:40:29,639 --> 07:40:31,919
Yeah, I'm friendly, bro.

7528
07:40:31,919 --> 07:40:35,580
Excellent.

7529
07:40:35,580 --> 07:40:37,180
You need any healing?

7530
07:40:37,180 --> 07:40:38,479
Uh, let me see.

7531
07:40:38,479 --> 07:40:41,139
Nah, I'm good. How you doing?

7532
07:40:41,139 --> 07:40:43,540
Alright, bro. I'm chilling.

7533
07:40:43,540 --> 07:40:47,360
Let's loot this room. There's a lot of stuff in here. Be careful though, there's demons.

7534
07:40:47,360 --> 07:41:20,189
What the hell?

7535
07:41:20,189 --> 07:41:23,830
Wait, hell just kind of just went to zero. I don't know what happened. I don't know.

7536
07:41:23,830 --> 07:41:26,169
The poison killed me?

7537
07:41:26,169 --> 07:41:44,470
The goblin spell did a U-turn.

7538
07:41:44,470 --> 07:41:50,729
That guy is going to be talking to me because there's no possible way that I die there.

7539
07:41:50,729 --> 07:42:12,099
He's probably still talking to me. And I've just been gone for 30 straight seconds.

7540
07:42:12,099 --> 07:42:18,250
Hmm. This game is so fun.

7541
07:42:18,250 --> 07:42:23,740
Alright, let me get a good one. I feel like I haven't had a good one in at least five to ten attempts.

7542
07:42:23,740 --> 07:42:26,369
It's been a bunch of horse shit.

7543
07:42:26,369 --> 07:42:51,569
Everybody stop everything we're doing.

7544
07:42:51,569 --> 07:42:59,009
Little Caesar's pretzel crust pizza is back.

7545
07:42:59,009 --> 07:43:18,180
My jaw is hitting the floor right now.

7546
07:43:18,180 --> 07:43:22,150
Can I actually break this with this weapon?

7547
07:43:22,150 --> 07:43:25,150
Or what? That's weird.

7548
07:43:25,150 --> 07:43:32,209
No, I can't. That's annoying.

7549
07:43:32,209 --> 07:43:53,700
Okay, I got a big problem.

7550
07:43:53,700 --> 07:44:03,500
And it's called, I keep forgetting which is bound to what.

7551
07:44:03,500 --> 07:44:06,939
I got to...what? Okay, it's on my thumb buttons that's why.

7552
07:44:06,939 --> 07:44:09,340
And they're right next to each other and it takes me a minute to figure it out.

7553
07:44:09,340 --> 07:44:13,259
I'm not going this way.

7554
07:44:13,259 --> 07:44:28,029
That's so annoying.

7555
07:44:28,029 --> 07:44:30,029
Stuck. Stuck. Stuck.

7556
07:44:30,029 --> 07:44:44,119
I'm going to step on the trap in a second, aren't I?

7557
07:44:44,119 --> 07:45:04,799
Oh my god, do I not have that perk? Did I switch it out? I was crouched.

7558
07:45:04,799 --> 07:45:13,650
I'm so confused.

7559
07:45:13,650 --> 07:45:27,470
Oh, poison.

7560
07:45:27,470 --> 07:45:37,720
Swing!

7561
07:45:37,720 --> 07:45:49,979
It's doing that thing again.

7562
07:45:49,979 --> 07:46:08,569
I hear somebody.

7563
07:46:08,569 --> 07:46:09,569
Fuck you.

7564
07:46:09,569 --> 07:46:44,470
Barbarian?

7565
07:46:44,470 --> 07:46:46,430
There's a barbarian somewhere right here.

7566
07:46:46,430 --> 07:46:48,029
What happened? This is a wall, I think.

7567
07:46:48,029 --> 07:46:56,500
Shit, I got to put that on a different keybind.

7568
07:46:56,500 --> 07:47:12,290
I keep, like, almost accidentally pressing it.

7569
07:47:12,290 --> 07:47:16,090
I need to pick it like a Q or something, because it's so hard for my brain to be like,

7570
07:47:16,090 --> 07:47:18,909
thumb button one.

7571
07:47:18,909 --> 07:47:20,509
And it's like, which one is that?

7572
07:47:20,509 --> 07:47:22,909
Is that the one that's closer to me or the one that's further away?

7573
07:47:22,909 --> 07:47:24,909
And I'm like, thumb button four. Which one is that?

7574
07:47:24,909 --> 07:47:27,259
Is that the one that's closest to me?

7575
07:47:27,259 --> 07:47:54,380
Thank you.

7576
07:47:54,380 --> 07:48:08,659
Stuck again.

7577
07:48:08,659 --> 07:48:10,060
Oh my goodness.

7578
07:48:10,060 --> 07:48:49,279
I was, like, wedged in between all three of their heads.

7579
07:48:49,279 --> 07:48:57,459
I have to leave at least a dollar.

7580
07:48:57,459 --> 07:48:59,490
So, stabbing.

7581
07:48:59,490 --> 07:49:00,689
You have to get it.

7582
07:49:00,689 --> 07:49:03,639
So, let me just make sure I know what's happening here.

7583
07:49:03,639 --> 07:49:10,130
Is it only that tiny little crosshair where you can actually hit?

7584
07:49:10,130 --> 07:49:13,529
Because I feel like I'm trying to hit the blade sort of on them.

7585
07:49:13,529 --> 07:49:20,180
It has to be directly like a little plate fighter for way too long.

7586
07:49:20,180 --> 07:49:25,099
Hey, we'll get a couple bucks.

7587
07:49:25,099 --> 07:49:43,930
That's pretty good.

7588
07:49:43,930 --> 07:49:45,490
14.

7589
07:49:45,490 --> 07:49:46,979
Let's go!

7590
07:49:46,979 --> 07:49:48,819
Oh, I only have 11.

7591
07:49:48,819 --> 07:50:03,419
Alright, last one.

7592
07:50:03,419 --> 07:50:10,419
This is the last one.

7593
07:50:10,419 --> 07:50:15,200
Yep, the demo's on the Steam Playtest demo thing.

7594
07:50:15,200 --> 07:50:17,909
Till the 13th.

7595
07:50:17,909 --> 07:50:22,860
If you want to play it, you've got three and a half days.

7596
07:50:22,860 --> 07:50:47,970
Three days or so.

7597
07:50:47,970 --> 07:50:48,569
No thanks.

7598
07:50:48,569 --> 07:51:14,659
Shit.

7599
07:51:14,659 --> 07:51:25,400
Alright, fighting people on stairs.

7600
07:51:25,400 --> 07:51:27,560
It's just not fun.

7601
07:51:27,560 --> 07:52:01,860
That's better.

7602
07:52:01,860 --> 07:52:04,459
Does the rogue get some kind of self-heal eventually or no?

7603
07:52:04,459 --> 07:52:24,330
Is somebody coming?

7604
07:52:24,330 --> 07:52:39,400
You gonna come down this hall?

7605
07:52:39,400 --> 07:52:40,400
Hmm?

7606
07:52:40,400 --> 07:52:47,270
Wait, yeah!

7607
07:52:47,270 --> 07:52:49,889
They weren't aggro'd before.

7608
07:52:49,889 --> 07:52:52,069
What?

7609
07:52:52,069 --> 07:52:57,459
I didn't even, I walked further away, not closer.

7610
07:52:57,459 --> 07:53:10,220
This sucks.

7611
07:53:10,220 --> 07:53:11,220
Out of the fryer.

7612
07:53:11,220 --> 07:53:12,819
And into the fryer later.

7613
07:53:12,819 --> 07:53:13,819
As they say.

7614
07:53:13,819 --> 07:53:20,750
It's good, bro.

7615
07:53:20,750 --> 07:53:23,729
Out of the fryer later.

7616
07:53:23,729 --> 07:53:27,669
And into the frying pan.

7617
07:53:27,669 --> 07:53:28,869
Hey.

7618
07:53:28,869 --> 07:53:30,229
Need some help?

7619
07:53:30,229 --> 07:53:32,659
If you had a heal, I would be so happy.

7620
07:53:32,659 --> 07:53:37,349
Yeah, I got you, bro.

7621
07:53:37,349 --> 07:53:38,950
Oh my goodness, that's so good.

7622
07:53:38,950 --> 07:53:40,389
You saved my life.

7623
07:53:40,389 --> 07:53:42,319
Here.

7624
07:53:42,319 --> 07:53:44,209
I got you, bro.

7625
07:53:44,209 --> 07:53:46,409
As long as you don't, you know, like stab me in the back or something.

7626
07:53:46,409 --> 07:53:47,209
But you will.

7627
07:53:47,209 --> 07:53:49,849
Thanks, bro.

7628
07:53:49,849 --> 07:53:55,689
So?

7629
07:53:55,689 --> 07:54:13,250
Yeah, we're friendly.

7630
07:54:13,250 --> 07:54:27,409
We're friendly.

7631
07:54:27,409 --> 07:54:30,810
Need all the friends we can get in this dump.

7632
07:54:30,810 --> 07:54:53,529
How the one of you need healing at all?

7633
07:54:53,529 --> 07:54:55,729
Can I have another one?

7634
07:54:55,729 --> 07:54:57,599
I don't want to be greedy.

7635
07:54:57,599 --> 07:54:58,830
I got you.

7636
07:54:58,830 --> 07:54:59,830
Not so good.

7637
07:54:59,830 --> 07:55:09,500
Go.

7638
07:55:18,709 --> 07:55:19,509
Let's try.

7639
07:55:19,509 --> 07:55:20,509
Wait, we're all friendly.

7640
07:55:20,509 --> 07:55:21,909
Let's go kill the main boss guy.

7641
07:55:21,909 --> 07:55:22,909
He's right over here.

7642
07:55:22,909 --> 07:55:23,909
Yes, let's go.

7643
07:55:23,909 --> 07:55:24,709
Let's go.

7644
07:55:24,709 --> 07:55:26,990
Yeah, what are we doing?

7645
07:55:26,990 --> 07:55:29,990
We could also play Duck Duck Goose to see who has to get killed.

7646
07:55:29,990 --> 07:55:33,490
The real boss is down here.

7647
07:55:33,490 --> 07:55:35,240
Jesus fuck.

7648
07:55:36,040 --> 07:55:37,639
It's just, you know, to get by.

7649
07:55:41,000 --> 07:55:43,779
For the guild.

7650
07:55:43,779 --> 07:56:10,380
Oh my God, he's gonna kill me.

7651
07:56:10,380 --> 07:56:11,380
No, I'm fine.

7652
07:56:19,259 --> 07:56:22,130
I've never seen this thing die before.

7653
07:56:22,130 --> 07:56:23,500
What do you have on him?

7654
07:56:23,500 --> 07:56:24,700
Well, sanctuary.

7655
07:56:24,700 --> 07:56:25,700
Come here, come here, come here.

7656
07:56:25,700 --> 07:56:26,500
Purple mace, bro.

7657
07:56:26,500 --> 07:56:33,520
Oh, that's pretty sweet.

7658
07:56:33,520 --> 07:56:42,009
Oh, hell yeah.

7659
07:56:42,009 --> 07:56:43,009
Thanks, bro.

7660
07:56:43,009 --> 07:56:57,900
Some really nice people.

7661
07:56:57,900 --> 07:57:03,340
You take it since you just got a purple thing.

7662
07:57:03,340 --> 07:57:04,340
Yeah, get out of here, man.

7663
07:57:04,340 --> 07:57:04,939
Thanks, bro.

7664
07:57:04,939 --> 07:57:06,139
Take the thing and stash it.

7665
07:57:06,139 --> 07:57:09,450
Does anyone need any extra healing at all before I go?

7666
07:57:09,450 --> 07:57:12,590
All right, I got you.

7667
07:57:12,590 --> 07:57:13,189
Hold on.

7668
07:57:13,189 --> 07:57:17,540
Hot.

7669
07:57:17,540 --> 07:57:18,139
What?

7670
07:57:18,139 --> 07:57:21,689
He's lied.

7671
07:57:21,689 --> 07:57:23,090
Oh my goodness.

7672
07:57:23,090 --> 07:57:30,380
And right when we talked about friends and friendship and companionship.

7673
07:57:30,380 --> 07:57:32,380
Bro's backstabbed.

7674
07:57:32,380 --> 07:57:35,180
I thought you just hit me and I was about to cry.

7675
07:57:35,180 --> 07:57:41,299
There was a spike in the wall.

7676
07:57:42,099 --> 07:57:42,900
Okay.

7677
07:57:44,900 --> 07:57:45,500
Did he die?

7678
07:57:45,500 --> 07:57:46,099
No.

7679
07:57:46,099 --> 07:57:46,500
Okay.

7680
07:57:46,500 --> 07:57:47,299
I thought he died.

7681
07:57:49,500 --> 07:57:52,740
What a dick.

7682
07:57:52,740 --> 07:57:55,240
Guys, I already killed the troll.

7683
07:57:55,240 --> 07:57:55,639
You did?

7684
07:57:55,639 --> 07:57:57,459
Oh, good stuff.

7685
07:57:57,459 --> 07:58:03,860
He looks dead.

7686
07:58:03,860 --> 07:58:14,459
Any scraps?

7687
07:58:14,459 --> 07:58:15,259
You got the purple.

7688
07:58:15,259 --> 07:58:15,860
You should take it.

7689
07:58:15,860 --> 07:58:17,459
And then he just walks in it.

7690
07:58:17,459 --> 07:58:19,060
Oh, I don't know which side it is.

7691
07:58:19,060 --> 07:58:22,029
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

7692
07:58:22,029 --> 07:58:26,430
We got to find you a portal.

7693
07:58:26,430 --> 07:58:27,830
Friends.

7694
07:58:27,830 --> 07:58:29,430
I'm going to open this up.

7695
07:58:29,430 --> 07:58:31,029
The cleric's got to take this.

7696
07:58:31,029 --> 07:58:32,229
We're all going to pick numbers.

7697
07:58:32,830 --> 07:58:35,830
Okay, that works.

7698
07:58:35,830 --> 07:58:38,229
Bro, just fucking run in.

7699
07:58:38,229 --> 07:58:39,229
No, no, no.

7700
07:58:46,540 --> 07:58:47,740
Unfortunate.

7701
07:58:47,740 --> 07:58:52,549
Chill, chill, chill.

7702
07:58:52,549 --> 07:58:55,950
We're all fucked here anyways.

7703
07:58:55,950 --> 07:58:56,750
You be having it.

7704
07:58:56,750 --> 07:58:59,840
How do we get you out of here with that purple?

7705
07:58:59,840 --> 07:59:01,340
I don't know.

7706
07:59:01,340 --> 07:59:04,740
I should probably stop saying that out loud, by the way.

7707
07:59:04,740 --> 07:59:05,740
Yeah, probably.

7708
07:59:06,740 --> 07:59:10,700
Come here.

7709
07:59:10,700 --> 07:59:13,099
It's like I'm trying to get him killed.

7710
07:59:13,099 --> 07:59:19,400
You need to get out of here with that purple.

7711
07:59:19,400 --> 07:59:22,560
I'm trying to be like...

7712
07:59:22,560 --> 07:59:26,360
What?

7713
07:59:26,360 --> 07:59:28,319
Was that him?

7714
07:59:28,319 --> 07:59:33,099
Where is it?

7715
07:59:33,099 --> 07:59:33,500
Where is it?

7716
07:59:33,500 --> 07:59:34,900
I need to give it back to him.

7717
07:59:34,900 --> 07:59:36,299
How did he die?

7718
07:59:36,299 --> 07:59:37,299
What if this is not it?

7719
07:59:37,299 --> 07:59:38,500
Somebody took it.

7720
07:59:38,500 --> 07:59:39,500
Who took that mace?

7721
07:59:39,500 --> 07:59:40,099
Who took that mace?

7722
07:59:40,099 --> 07:59:42,299
I need to know.

7723
07:59:42,299 --> 07:59:43,099
What mace?

7724
07:59:43,099 --> 08:00:00,340
Who took the mace?

7725
08:00:00,340 --> 08:00:03,669
No, I tried.

7726
08:00:03,669 --> 08:00:06,479
I had to get revenge.

7727
08:00:06,479 --> 08:00:12,340
That was so sad.

7728
08:00:12,340 --> 08:00:16,389
That was sad.

7729
08:00:16,389 --> 08:00:20,159
I was sitting there talking to him, and he's dead.

7730
08:00:20,159 --> 08:00:25,889
What killed him?

7731
08:00:25,889 --> 08:00:27,689
That guy was so nice, too.

7732
08:00:27,689 --> 08:00:28,490
He was healing.

7733
08:00:28,490 --> 08:00:31,290
Hey, anybody else need to be topped off?

7734
08:00:31,290 --> 08:00:32,490
Oh, yeah, sure, man.

7735
08:00:32,490 --> 08:00:33,490
I do.

7736
08:00:33,490 --> 08:00:37,180
Oh, yeah, here.

7737
08:00:37,180 --> 08:00:38,580
No good deed.

7738
08:00:38,580 --> 08:00:52,599
It was unfunished, unfortunately.

7739
08:00:52,599 --> 08:00:55,759
Hey, I was trying to tell him to just run in.

7740
08:00:55,759 --> 08:00:57,520
Can't trust anybody.

7741
08:00:57,520 --> 08:01:09,650
You really can't?

7742
08:01:09,650 --> 08:01:11,049
Yeah, a shitload of subs came in.

7743
08:01:11,049 --> 08:01:13,380
Oh, my God.

7744
08:01:13,380 --> 08:01:14,580
I don't really shout subs out.

7745
08:01:14,580 --> 08:01:17,380
I don't shout subs or bits or donations or anything like that out.

7746
08:01:17,380 --> 08:01:23,740
But Jesus, it's completely unnecessary.

7747
08:01:23,740 --> 08:01:24,939
But I appreciate it.

7748
08:01:24,939 --> 08:01:38,419
Thank you.

7749
08:01:38,419 --> 08:01:40,020
Oh, boy, I'm already dead here.

7750
08:01:40,020 --> 08:01:42,360
Not if I go invisible.

7751
08:01:42,360 --> 08:01:46,529
Whatever.

7752
08:01:46,529 --> 08:01:47,130
That one doesn't count?

7753
08:01:47,130 --> 08:01:47,729
No, it doesn't.

7754
08:01:47,729 --> 08:01:53,569
Let me play one more to get the character I know how to play.

7755
08:01:53,569 --> 08:01:54,770
This game is so addicting.

7756
08:01:54,770 --> 08:02:12,720
There's something about it.

7757
08:02:12,720 --> 08:02:13,720
We're getting the comedy run.

7758
08:02:13,720 --> 08:02:27,450
Oh, I think that one was a comedy run.

7759
08:02:27,450 --> 08:02:28,450
Last one, Larry?

7760
08:02:28,450 --> 08:02:37,669
Yeah.

7761
08:02:37,669 --> 08:02:38,869
Can't trust anybody.

7762
08:02:39,669 --> 08:02:41,069
Oh, man.

7763
08:02:41,069 --> 08:02:42,270
It's a cool purple, too.

7764
08:02:42,270 --> 08:02:46,650
And it's like, wow, a cool purple.

7765
08:02:46,650 --> 08:02:57,659
It's not always a bad start.

7766
08:02:57,659 --> 08:02:58,259
Swing.

7767
08:02:58,259 --> 08:02:59,759
Swing.

7768
08:02:59,759 --> 08:03:30,819
Sometimes, man, this game ran away.

7769
08:03:30,819 --> 08:03:32,819
I feel the most safe with Fighter.

7770
08:03:32,819 --> 08:03:37,369
I know it's a default class, but still.

7771
08:03:37,369 --> 08:03:39,169
Are they actually going to put a bard in?

7772
08:03:39,169 --> 08:03:43,299
That'd be fun, actually.

7773
08:03:43,299 --> 08:03:56,779
What?

7774
08:03:56,779 --> 08:03:58,779
They use it now, unfortunately.

7775
08:03:58,779 --> 08:04:19,229
Was the pretzel cross pizza thing actually back,

7776
08:04:19,229 --> 08:04:20,430
or was that person just saying that

7777
08:04:20,430 --> 08:04:41,729
and now just severely pissed me off?

7778
08:04:41,729 --> 08:05:00,180
Got your back.

7779
08:05:00,180 --> 08:05:12,619
Ooh, that's good.

7780
08:05:12,619 --> 08:05:17,150
We could get that middle group.

7781
08:05:17,150 --> 08:05:22,049
Actually, I got to leave.

7782
08:05:22,049 --> 08:05:28,849
Coming soon.

7783
08:05:28,849 --> 08:05:31,759
Want to go for the middle group?

7784
08:05:31,759 --> 08:05:35,180
You think we can take them?

7785
08:05:35,180 --> 08:05:43,060
Think so.

7786
08:05:43,060 --> 08:05:48,549
Oh, my God, that hurt a lot.

7787
08:05:48,549 --> 08:05:52,360
I'm so slow.

7788
08:05:52,360 --> 08:06:00,299
Oh, my God, that's doing so much damage to me.

7789
08:06:00,299 --> 08:06:17,259
We got to loot and get out of here.

7790
08:06:17,259 --> 08:06:28,080
Actually, pick it up and give one of them.

7791
08:06:28,080 --> 08:06:46,060
We got to go.

7792
08:06:46,060 --> 08:06:48,720
I'm going to use the campfire.

7793
08:06:48,720 --> 08:07:02,119
Let's go in a safe place and use the...

7794
08:07:02,520 --> 08:07:05,360
Nowhere else really to do this, and I need it right now.

7795
08:07:05,360 --> 08:07:28,810
We're in the circle.

7796
08:07:28,810 --> 08:07:34,700
Yep.

7797
08:07:34,700 --> 08:07:53,020
Oh, shit.

7798
08:07:53,020 --> 08:08:05,419
Portal somewhere around here.

7799
08:08:05,419 --> 08:08:33,709
Shit went down over here on the portal.

7800
08:08:33,709 --> 08:08:38,680
This is dangerous down here.

7801
08:08:38,680 --> 08:08:44,669
I don't think we want to go down here.

7802
08:08:44,669 --> 08:08:57,599
Yeah, that's just certain death.

7803
08:08:57,599 --> 08:08:58,200
Friendly.

7804
08:08:58,200 --> 08:09:06,060
I'm not one of those backstabbers.

7805
08:09:06,060 --> 08:09:08,889
Oops.

7806
08:09:08,889 --> 08:09:16,150
He's looking around.

7807
08:09:16,150 --> 08:09:32,750
Oh, no.

7808
08:09:32,750 --> 08:09:34,330
Ah, shit.

7809
08:09:34,330 --> 08:09:35,330
I almost did it too.

7810
08:09:35,330 --> 08:09:36,529
Can I have another one of those heels?

7811
08:09:36,529 --> 08:10:07,580
Oh, shit.

7812
08:10:07,580 --> 08:10:09,779
Hey, come take this cabinet.

7813
08:10:09,779 --> 08:10:25,240
You got any more of those heels on you?

7814
08:10:25,240 --> 08:10:26,040
Oh, no.

7815
08:10:27,040 --> 08:10:28,439
We got to fight for this.

7816
08:10:28,439 --> 08:10:30,709
We have to fight for this.

7817
08:10:30,709 --> 08:10:31,310
I'm sorry.

7818
08:10:31,310 --> 08:10:33,970
We have to fight for this.

7819
08:10:33,970 --> 08:10:39,020
Don't we?

7820
08:10:39,020 --> 08:10:48,200
All right, good luck.

7821
08:10:48,200 --> 08:10:54,619
I was willing to do a duel for it.

7822
08:10:54,619 --> 08:10:55,220
You know what I mean?

7823
08:10:55,220 --> 08:10:57,020
If I want to go, you want to go.

7824
08:10:57,020 --> 08:10:59,419
I mean, we could have fought to the death for it, I think.

7825
08:10:59,419 --> 08:11:18,490
And I think that's a fair way to do it.

7826
08:11:18,490 --> 08:11:19,689
Still a clerk?

7827
08:11:19,689 --> 08:11:26,939
Can live a pretty long time in the dust.

7828
08:11:26,939 --> 08:11:30,479
Is there still a portal?

7829
08:11:30,479 --> 08:11:31,680
Oh, there's one right there.

7830
08:11:31,680 --> 08:11:32,479
You got it.

7831
08:11:32,479 --> 08:11:33,860
You got it.

7832
08:11:33,860 --> 08:11:38,189
You got it.

7833
08:11:38,189 --> 08:11:39,790
It's so close.

7834
08:11:39,790 --> 08:11:41,740
Please.

7835
08:11:41,740 --> 08:11:42,939
No.

7836
08:11:42,939 --> 08:11:44,970
Oh, yes.

7837
08:11:44,970 --> 08:11:45,369
All right.

7838
08:11:45,369 --> 08:11:45,770
Good.

7839
08:11:45,770 --> 08:11:46,169
All right.

7840
08:11:46,169 --> 08:11:47,720
We're good.

7841
08:11:47,720 --> 08:11:48,319
Damn.

7842
08:11:48,319 --> 08:11:49,119
Just barely.

7843
08:11:49,119 --> 08:11:56,279
I want to make sure you made it out alive.

7844
08:11:56,279 --> 08:11:59,450
That's a lot of stuff.

7845
08:11:59,450 --> 08:12:02,860
Get rid of it.

7846
08:12:02,860 --> 08:12:10,490
Damn.

7847
08:12:10,490 --> 08:12:12,549
Damn.

7848
08:12:12,549 --> 08:12:23,080
85 gold.

7849
08:12:23,080 --> 08:12:23,680
Nice.

7850
08:12:23,680 --> 08:12:36,689
I'll keep the...

7851
08:12:36,689 --> 08:13:03,009
I got to start collecting kind of middle of the road shitty gear.

7852
08:13:03,009 --> 08:13:08,799
I feel like I just dump everything.

7853
08:13:08,799 --> 08:13:13,759
What's that in the corner?

7854
08:13:13,759 --> 08:13:18,080
It's been like a weird bug.

7855
08:13:18,080 --> 08:13:19,680
I can't like scroll over it.

7856
08:13:19,680 --> 08:13:21,930
Weird.

7857
08:13:21,930 --> 08:13:22,529
It won't let me.

7858
08:13:22,529 --> 08:13:23,930
It's like a little force field or something.

7859
08:13:23,930 --> 08:13:29,939
All right.

7860
08:13:29,939 --> 08:13:30,740
Last one.

7861
08:13:30,740 --> 08:13:38,580
Final one.

7862
08:13:42,479 --> 08:13:44,080
This is truly the final one.

7863
08:13:44,080 --> 08:13:45,080
It's like 2 a.m.

7864
08:13:45,080 --> 08:13:46,479
And I got to eat some more food.

7865
08:13:46,479 --> 08:13:48,669
Oh, well.

7866
08:13:48,669 --> 08:13:50,069
This game really is really fun though.

7867
08:13:50,069 --> 08:13:52,639
Even though I'm not very good at it.

7868
08:13:52,639 --> 08:13:53,439
There's something about it.

7869
08:13:53,439 --> 08:13:56,779
The treachery.

7870
08:13:56,779 --> 08:13:58,790
The companionship.

7871
08:13:58,790 --> 08:13:59,389
There's so much...

7872
08:13:59,389 --> 08:13:59,790
You know what?

7873
08:13:59,790 --> 08:14:03,689
It feels like there's so much heartbreak.

7874
08:14:03,689 --> 08:14:06,090
It feels like every two or three rounds,

7875
08:14:06,090 --> 08:14:09,919
there's a story that's been told.

7876
08:14:09,919 --> 08:14:10,520
It's cool.

7877
08:14:10,520 --> 08:14:18,400
I like it.

7878
08:14:18,400 --> 08:14:26,130
It reminds me of the way people acted in the TF2 days.

7879
08:14:26,130 --> 08:14:30,200
Just that goofy shit that was constantly happening.

7880
08:14:30,200 --> 08:14:33,400
People just randomly RPing for no reason.

7881
08:14:33,400 --> 08:14:35,700
People walking into traps and dying.

7882
08:14:35,700 --> 08:14:36,900
Not the sandwich heavy shit.

7883
08:14:36,900 --> 08:14:41,020
Like it just reminds me of those old days of...

7884
08:14:41,020 --> 08:14:43,529
You kind of never know what's going to happen.

7885
08:14:43,529 --> 08:14:49,750
Which means it's worth playing over and over again.

7886
08:14:49,750 --> 08:14:53,240
And I'll be honest, if anything can scratch that itch again,

7887
08:14:53,240 --> 08:14:54,040
I'm going to play it.

7888
08:14:54,040 --> 08:14:58,619
And that's what's happening.

7889
08:14:58,619 --> 08:15:01,220
I think the guy running in to try to fight the troll.

7890
08:15:01,220 --> 08:15:01,819
Oh, hey, yeah.

7891
08:15:01,819 --> 08:15:02,819
Let's fight it.

7892
08:15:02,819 --> 08:15:05,220
And he dies in one hit.

7893
08:15:05,220 --> 08:15:08,580
That person told a whole story in two minutes.

7894
08:15:08,580 --> 08:15:21,729
It was hilarious.

7895
08:15:21,729 --> 08:15:23,889
You're going to hate this game in a week.

7896
08:15:23,889 --> 08:15:27,490
Well, I won't be able to because it's not going to be playable in a week.

7897
08:15:27,490 --> 08:15:40,020
So getting just enough.

7898
08:15:40,020 --> 08:15:43,740
No, no, no.

7899
08:15:43,740 --> 08:16:00,630
We got to fight.

7900
08:16:00,630 --> 08:16:02,430
How are you still alive, man?

7901
08:16:02,430 --> 08:16:09,590
Come on, dude.

7902
08:16:09,590 --> 08:16:17,220
Archers still right here.

7903
08:16:17,220 --> 08:16:19,580
There's two archers.

7904
08:16:19,580 --> 08:16:20,979
This is bad.

7905
08:16:20,979 --> 08:16:33,990
What?

7906
08:16:33,990 --> 08:16:48,099
I'm so tilted by that that I'm like...

7907
08:16:48,099 --> 08:16:49,500
Two archers.

7908
08:16:49,500 --> 08:16:51,500
You may as well just leave the room.

7909
08:16:51,500 --> 08:16:56,330
Because your opportunity to attack is just gone completely.

7910
08:16:56,330 --> 08:17:27,259
That didn't count.

7911
08:17:27,259 --> 08:17:39,540
This is actually the last one because I'm starting to get like foggy.

7912
08:17:39,540 --> 08:17:45,110
This is not the type of game you play when you're like foggy, tired.

7913
08:17:45,110 --> 08:17:48,509
Oh, this is exactly when I wanted to play and how long I wanted to play.

7914
08:17:48,509 --> 08:17:49,110
Yeah, this is it.

7915
08:17:49,110 --> 08:17:51,090
Let's do it.

7916
08:17:51,090 --> 08:17:52,490
Definitely not bringing this weander out.

7917
08:17:52,490 --> 08:18:01,919
No way.

7918
08:18:01,919 --> 08:18:04,209
Oh, yeah, foggy, foggy.

7919
08:18:04,209 --> 08:18:18,099
It's like I'm looking through a fucking foggy window right now.

7920
08:18:18,099 --> 08:18:43,580
You're going to do this to me twice in a row.

7921
08:18:43,580 --> 08:18:44,380
Don't get overwhelmed.

7922
08:18:44,380 --> 08:18:50,900
They're going to be spawning over and over again, but they're not red.

7923
08:18:50,900 --> 08:19:04,939
Good.

7924
08:19:04,939 --> 08:19:10,580
Coins.

7925
08:19:10,580 --> 08:19:12,950
I would like to get out of here with a bunch of stuff.

7926
08:19:12,950 --> 08:19:23,889
Oh, that's good.

7927
08:19:23,889 --> 08:19:50,580
Very, very nice.

7928
08:19:50,580 --> 08:20:08,419
What on earth are you doing?

7929
08:20:08,419 --> 08:20:08,819
Stop doing that.

7930
08:20:08,819 --> 08:20:22,720
Why is it doing that?

7931
08:20:22,720 --> 08:20:36,770
Let's go.

7932
08:20:36,770 --> 08:20:38,130
Good morning.

7933
08:20:38,130 --> 08:20:41,029
Good morning.

7934
08:20:41,029 --> 08:20:54,680
How are you?

7935
08:20:54,680 --> 08:20:56,509
Who is your daddy?

7936
08:20:56,509 --> 08:21:29,950
And what does he do?

7937
08:21:29,950 --> 08:21:37,270
It's better not be a mimic.

7938
08:21:37,270 --> 08:21:44,500
I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions and I want to have them answered immediately.

7939
08:21:44,500 --> 08:21:46,400
Who is your daddy?

7940
08:21:46,400 --> 08:21:54,099
What does he do?

7941
08:21:54,099 --> 08:22:12,299
Well, I hope you leave enough room for my fist because I'm going to ram it into your stomach.

7942
08:22:12,299 --> 08:22:21,860
Goodbye.

7943
08:22:21,860 --> 08:22:28,080
I heard portal and I would love to find it.

7944
08:22:28,080 --> 08:22:43,740
Was that behind me or this is the place to be to look at?

7945
08:22:43,740 --> 08:22:46,740
Yes, he missed and hit me.

7946
08:22:46,740 --> 08:22:59,099
Shit.

7947
08:22:59,099 --> 08:23:01,169
You fucking around?

7948
08:23:01,169 --> 08:23:06,540
Oh, you are fucking around, aren't you?

7949
08:23:06,540 --> 08:23:07,540
Oh shit, portal down there.

7950
08:23:07,540 --> 08:23:07,939
Fuck.

7951
08:23:07,939 --> 08:23:09,540
I don't care anymore about fighting anybody.

7952
08:23:09,540 --> 08:23:19,790
Portal down.

7953
08:23:19,790 --> 08:23:21,740
I don't want to fight you.

7954
08:23:21,740 --> 08:23:22,740
I don't want to fight you.

7955
08:23:22,740 --> 08:23:52,360
You're shooting arrows at me though.

7956
08:23:52,360 --> 08:24:14,020
Where is it?

7957
08:24:15,060 --> 08:24:21,139
What the fuck was somebody behind me?

7958
08:24:21,139 --> 08:24:22,939
There was a fucking guy behind me.

7959
08:24:22,939 --> 08:24:25,840
It wasn't there.

7960
08:24:25,840 --> 08:24:27,470
I would have had that too.

7961
08:24:27,470 --> 08:24:37,119
Fuck.

7962
08:24:37,119 --> 08:24:45,939
Goblin was hitting me from behind.

7963
08:24:45,939 --> 08:24:46,740
How much damage?

7964
08:24:46,740 --> 08:24:53,860
Did you take more damage from behind?

7965
08:24:53,860 --> 08:24:56,459
I feel like I could have gotten out of that too.

7966
08:24:56,459 --> 08:25:02,259
I tried to jump around, but I bumped into the fucking lamp post and everything is just collision in this game.

7967
08:25:02,259 --> 08:25:56,130
I just fell straight down.

7968
08:25:56,130 --> 08:25:56,930
I don't want to use it.

7969
08:25:56,930 --> 08:27:05,790
That hurt somebody who's behind me right now.

7970
08:27:05,790 --> 08:27:06,990
Okay, I got some pretty good stuff.

7971
08:27:06,990 --> 08:27:19,229
I got to actually hunker down here.

7972
08:27:19,229 --> 08:27:38,299
Why you both have the same animation right now?

7973
08:27:38,299 --> 08:27:40,979
You became an EU streamer.

7974
08:27:40,979 --> 08:27:41,979
Yeah, technically, right?

7975
08:27:41,979 --> 08:28:07,779
No bullshit here.

7976
08:28:07,779 --> 08:28:17,549
That's the secret escape tunnel.

7977
08:28:17,549 --> 08:28:23,900
Are you going to shoot?

7978
08:28:23,900 --> 08:28:44,229
Why are they all acting like this?

7979
08:28:44,229 --> 08:28:52,720
They're scared of me.

7980
08:28:52,720 --> 08:28:58,520
I want to loot this room so bad, but that's not happening.

7981
08:28:58,520 --> 08:29:03,060
I guess maybe I could.

7982
08:29:03,060 --> 08:29:04,459
Oh, you little shit.

7983
08:29:04,459 --> 08:29:23,060
Just die.

7984
08:29:23,060 --> 08:29:24,860
How many hits is this guy going to take?

7985
08:29:24,860 --> 08:29:29,479
I've hit him five times.

7986
08:29:29,479 --> 08:29:42,020
Oh, would you just fuck off already?

7987
08:29:42,020 --> 08:29:46,060
Whatever.

7988
08:29:46,060 --> 08:29:46,659
I heard it.

7989
08:29:46,659 --> 08:29:48,860
Where was it?

7990
08:29:48,860 --> 08:29:51,020
I heard it.

7991
08:29:51,020 --> 08:29:54,009
I don't know where it is though.

7992
08:29:54,009 --> 08:29:54,509
You know what?

7993
08:29:54,509 --> 08:29:57,439
You little fuck face.

7994
08:29:57,439 --> 08:30:16,750
I'm going to enjoy this.

7995
08:30:16,750 --> 08:30:17,549
So much good stuff.

7996
08:30:17,549 --> 08:30:27,560
So much for the tunnel now.

7997
08:30:27,560 --> 08:30:33,860
How do I go through the tunnel?

7998
08:30:33,860 --> 08:30:35,479
Is it just open?

7999
08:30:35,479 --> 08:30:41,790
Wait, I can just leave?

8000
08:30:41,790 --> 08:30:50,900
Did I win?

8001
08:30:50,900 --> 08:30:52,000
Holy shit.

8002
08:30:52,000 --> 08:31:07,060
Yeah.

8003
08:31:07,060 --> 08:31:08,060
It's worth a lot.

8004
08:31:08,060 --> 08:31:27,729
Goodness.

8005
08:31:27,729 --> 08:31:36,849
No, I'll keep these.

8006
08:31:36,849 --> 08:31:37,849
Why do I have this?

8007
08:31:55,569 --> 08:31:59,099
All right, one more.

8008
08:31:59,099 --> 08:32:04,759
I'm going to stab him.

8009
08:32:04,759 --> 08:32:05,959
I'm going to stab him like this.

8010
08:32:05,959 --> 08:32:06,459
I'm going to...

8011
08:32:06,459 --> 08:33:00,139
Tell me if this sounds funny.

8012
08:33:00,139 --> 08:33:01,139
If I kill somebody, I'm going to...

8013
08:33:01,139 --> 08:33:16,020
I have to say that.

8014
08:33:16,020 --> 08:33:27,069
I want to be able to see you.

8015
08:33:27,069 --> 08:33:28,169
Do it when you die.

8016
08:33:28,169 --> 08:33:28,470
Yeah.

8017
08:33:28,470 --> 08:33:28,970
Okay.

8018
08:33:28,970 --> 08:33:41,959
Was it supposed to be a voice filter?

8019
08:33:41,959 --> 08:33:44,099
Yes, there is.

8020
08:33:44,099 --> 08:33:51,819
Can you not hear anything?

8021
08:33:51,819 --> 08:33:53,479
There's not.

8022
08:33:53,479 --> 08:34:02,680
Yeah, you can.

8023
08:34:02,680 --> 08:34:09,979
Hey, you guys are messing with me, right?

8024
08:34:09,979 --> 08:34:14,549
Too subtle.

8025
08:34:14,549 --> 08:34:16,720
How about this?

8026
08:34:16,720 --> 08:34:46,740
Is this subtle enough for you?

8027
08:34:53,639 --> 08:34:57,279
Don't run.

8028
08:34:57,279 --> 08:35:09,659
You've ruined everything because now I can't open the chests.

8029
08:35:09,659 --> 08:35:16,360
Blah.

8030
08:35:16,360 --> 08:35:17,959
Oh, this is very bad too.

8031
08:35:17,959 --> 08:35:18,919
I'm going down.

8032
08:35:18,919 --> 08:35:23,349
Fuck it.

8033
08:35:23,349 --> 08:35:24,250
Not putting up with...

8034
08:35:24,250 --> 08:35:25,849
There's a bug behind me.

8035
08:35:25,849 --> 08:35:27,889
The worst bugs in the game.

8036
08:35:27,889 --> 08:35:36,959
I hate those things so much.

8037
08:35:36,959 --> 08:35:41,060
Dark and darker.

8038
08:35:41,060 --> 08:35:42,060
Oh shit, bro.

8039
08:35:42,060 --> 08:35:43,459
What have you done?

8040
08:35:43,459 --> 08:35:45,159
What did you bring in here?

8041
08:35:45,159 --> 08:35:46,159
Oh.

8042
08:35:46,159 --> 08:35:47,860
Oh my God.

8043
08:35:47,860 --> 08:35:50,159
Oh my God.

8044
08:35:50,159 --> 08:35:55,950
Oh my God.

8045
08:35:55,950 --> 08:35:59,569
Oh shit.

8046
08:35:59,569 --> 08:36:02,080
Oh no.

8047
08:36:02,080 --> 08:36:02,979
All right, I'm going to bed.

8048
08:36:02,979 --> 08:36:21,880
I'm out of here.

8049
08:36:21,880 --> 08:36:40,319
I can't end on that one.

8050
08:36:40,319 --> 08:37:01,549
I wonder what that must have looked like on their screen.

8051
08:37:01,549 --> 08:37:12,500
So many things were buying them.

8052
08:37:12,500 --> 08:37:50,150
Oh, please.

8053
08:37:50,150 --> 08:37:57,909
I feel like I've picked this up a lot.

8054
08:37:57,909 --> 08:38:01,720
You made it through my entire work night.

8055
08:38:01,720 --> 08:38:02,020
Yeah.

8056
08:38:02,020 --> 08:38:04,869
I mean, well, it's not going to be around.

8057
08:38:04,970 --> 08:38:07,540
And I know if I don't get my fill of this,

8058
08:38:07,540 --> 08:38:34,680
I'm going to be disappointed that I didn't.

8059
08:38:34,680 --> 08:38:39,500
Shit going down over there.

8060
08:38:39,500 --> 08:38:40,900
Swing, please.

8061
08:38:40,900 --> 08:39:17,099
Now's the time to bug out.

8062
08:39:17,099 --> 08:39:34,479
You kill one, two more spawn.

8063
08:39:34,479 --> 08:39:47,299
Very nice.

8064
08:39:47,299 --> 08:40:22,479
Hot inside of a pod.

8065
08:40:22,479 --> 08:40:24,380
Double lantern hog.

8066
08:40:24,380 --> 08:40:34,680
Who's breaking those pots up there?

8067
08:40:34,680 --> 08:40:36,549
Stop breaking my pots.

8068
08:40:36,549 --> 08:40:39,250
It's taking me so long to put them in those pots.

8069
08:40:39,250 --> 08:40:41,720
Stop doing that.

8070
08:40:41,720 --> 08:41:10,229
Let's freak that person out.

8071
08:41:10,229 --> 08:41:19,569
Come on.

8072
08:41:19,569 --> 08:41:20,990
Nice.

8073
08:41:20,990 --> 08:41:21,689
Oh my goodness.

8074
08:41:21,689 --> 08:41:25,090
I didn't even realize what was happening.

8075
08:41:25,090 --> 08:41:27,500
I'm taking my sweet ass time here.

8076
08:41:27,500 --> 08:41:28,099
I don't care.

8077
08:41:28,099 --> 08:41:28,900
I want to.

8078
08:41:28,900 --> 08:42:07,659
I'm looting it.

8079
08:42:07,659 --> 08:42:17,840
Fuck you.

8080
08:42:17,840 --> 08:42:18,939
Where is it?

8081
08:42:18,939 --> 08:42:20,040
Fucking just heard it.

8082
08:42:20,040 --> 08:43:03,770
Fucking die.

8083
08:43:03,770 --> 08:43:04,869
Oh my God.

8084
08:43:04,869 --> 08:43:34,419
Why do you have more health than these assholes?

8085
08:43:34,419 --> 08:43:35,619
I wasn't trying to sneak up on you.

8086
08:43:35,619 --> 08:43:37,020
I was trying to go around you because I thought you were going

8087
08:43:37,020 --> 08:43:37,619
to try to kill me.

8088
08:43:37,619 --> 08:43:38,720
So I tried to avoid you.

8089
08:43:38,720 --> 08:44:25,069
There's a portal right now.

8090
08:44:25,069 --> 08:44:26,069
These red spiders.

8091
08:44:26,069 --> 08:44:32,869
They're going to screw everything up for us.

8092
08:44:32,869 --> 08:44:34,169
No.

8093
08:44:34,169 --> 08:44:37,549
Of course.

8094
08:44:37,549 --> 08:44:40,950
Why are they aggro to me the whole time?

8095
08:44:40,950 --> 08:44:41,849
They're aggro to me.

8096
08:44:42,349 --> 08:44:44,250
He's standing still.

8097
08:44:44,250 --> 08:44:46,849
Why are they just running in a circle around me?

8098
08:44:46,849 --> 08:44:49,580
Why did they not attack him?

8099
08:44:49,580 --> 08:44:57,680
What the fuck?

8100
08:44:57,680 --> 08:45:05,569
Where is it?

8101
08:45:05,569 --> 08:45:06,169
Where is it?

8102
08:45:06,169 --> 08:45:09,389
Is it not up right?

8103
08:45:09,389 --> 08:45:12,060
I heard it.

8104
08:45:12,060 --> 08:45:13,560
It's up or down a floor.

8105
08:45:13,560 --> 08:45:16,979
Oh, I hate this shit.

8106
08:45:16,979 --> 08:45:19,619
Because by the time that this stuff spawns,

8107
08:45:19,619 --> 08:45:21,720
you're fucking in the red.

8108
08:45:21,720 --> 08:45:23,819
And everyone's beat up.

8109
08:45:23,819 --> 08:45:25,159
Everyone's happy.

8110
08:45:25,159 --> 08:45:32,599
I thought that was in the person.

8111
08:45:32,599 --> 08:45:35,119
Go down?

8112
08:45:35,119 --> 08:45:38,520
I honestly just don't even know how to go down.

8113
08:45:38,520 --> 08:45:39,979
I'm going to go.

8114
08:45:39,979 --> 08:45:46,400
I heard another one.

8115
08:45:46,400 --> 08:45:51,430
No, I thought it was over here.

8116
08:45:51,430 --> 08:45:56,540
Stay here?

8117
08:45:56,540 --> 08:46:00,639
I mean, I hate that it spawns below you

8118
08:46:00,639 --> 08:46:02,970
and the fucking red circle's already here.

8119
08:46:02,970 --> 08:46:04,900
They've all already spawned.

8120
08:46:04,900 --> 08:46:14,040
God.

8121
08:46:14,040 --> 08:46:26,919
Good luck finding it.

8122
08:46:26,919 --> 08:46:30,080
The fact that there's three levels here,

8123
08:46:30,080 --> 08:46:33,950
at the very end, when there's nowhere to go,

8124
08:46:33,950 --> 08:46:39,950
if one spawns above or below, it just fucks you.

8125
08:46:39,950 --> 08:46:41,450
Too many layers.

8126
08:46:41,450 --> 08:47:00,759
Too many layers.

8127
08:47:00,759 --> 08:47:02,259
I was going to win that one, too.

8128
08:47:02,259 --> 08:47:02,860
You know what?

8129
08:47:02,860 --> 08:47:05,340
No, I'm not being nice anymore.

8130
08:47:05,340 --> 08:47:07,840
I'm just killing anyone I come across.

8131
08:47:07,840 --> 08:47:12,209
To be fair, though, I wasn't being nice.

8132
08:47:12,209 --> 08:47:14,409
I was genuinely afraid of that guy.

8133
08:47:14,409 --> 08:47:18,880
It's different.

8134
08:47:18,880 --> 08:47:21,080
Running around in circles with these two spiders.

8135
08:47:21,080 --> 08:47:25,880
And this guy's just like, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

8136
08:47:25,880 --> 08:47:27,180
Nothing even attacks him.

8137
08:47:27,180 --> 08:47:27,779
I'm running around.

8138
08:47:27,779 --> 08:47:37,569
I got these spiders chasing my ass.

8139
08:47:37,569 --> 08:47:54,090
That guy wrote a whole book report.

8140
08:47:54,090 --> 08:47:55,290
Nope.

8141
08:47:55,290 --> 08:48:25,180
That's not happening.

8142
08:48:25,180 --> 08:48:26,080
Whoa!

8143
08:48:26,080 --> 08:48:27,880
That actually scared the shit out of me.

8144
08:48:27,880 --> 08:48:28,979
My whole body hurts.

8145
08:48:28,979 --> 08:48:30,180
I thought that was a player.

8146
08:48:30,180 --> 08:48:35,630
Goodness.

8147
08:48:35,630 --> 08:48:36,130
Please.

8148
08:48:41,979 --> 08:48:45,080
Did I even aggro this many monsters?

8149
08:48:45,080 --> 08:48:47,979
When did that happen?

8150
08:48:47,979 --> 08:48:49,080
Oh, it's over.

8151
08:48:49,080 --> 08:48:50,180
Oh, come on.

8152
08:48:50,180 --> 08:48:51,279
I can't go out on that.

8153
08:48:51,279 --> 08:48:57,639
That sucked.

8154
08:48:57,639 --> 08:49:00,500
God damn it.

8155
08:49:00,500 --> 08:49:04,520
I mean, maybe if I just keep walking them around.

8156
08:49:04,520 --> 08:49:07,639
Where are they all coming from?

8157
08:49:07,639 --> 08:49:11,340
The whole fucking floor is aggro'd to me.

8158
08:49:11,340 --> 08:49:33,950
What the hell?

8159
08:49:37,020 --> 08:49:38,619
All right, no matter what, this is the last one.

8160
08:49:38,619 --> 08:49:42,049
Is it?

8161
08:49:42,049 --> 08:49:47,130
This is the last one.

8162
08:49:47,130 --> 08:49:50,509
If this is not the last game, because I need to go to bed.

8163
08:49:50,509 --> 08:49:56,700
If this is not the last game, then I will eat a pair of shoes on camera.

8164
08:49:56,700 --> 08:49:58,400
The last game for tonight.

8165
08:49:58,400 --> 08:49:59,099
The last game for tonight.

8166
08:49:59,099 --> 08:50:00,599
I'm going to play again probably on Friday.

8167
08:50:00,599 --> 08:50:04,430
I mean, just for this period right now, this stream right now,

8168
08:50:04,430 --> 08:50:06,529
I will eat a pair of shoes on camera if this is not the last one,

8169
08:50:06,529 --> 08:50:07,229
because I got to go to bed.

8170
08:50:07,229 --> 08:50:08,029
But I love this game.

8171
08:50:08,029 --> 08:50:08,330
It's fun.

8172
08:50:08,330 --> 08:50:08,630
Don't worry.

8173
08:50:08,630 --> 08:50:09,130
I'll be fine.

8174
08:50:09,130 --> 08:50:09,729
Don't worry about me.

8175
08:50:09,729 --> 08:50:10,930
Worry about yourself.

8176
08:50:10,930 --> 08:50:11,330
What are you doing?

8177
08:50:11,330 --> 08:50:12,430
You okay?

8178
08:50:12,430 --> 08:50:59,599
Things going all right?

8179
08:50:59,599 --> 08:51:01,400
The game lagged a little.

8180
08:51:01,400 --> 08:51:13,790
You saw what happened.

8181
08:51:13,790 --> 08:51:15,790
Elderly man in Las Vegas.

8182
08:51:15,790 --> 08:51:20,959
He won't go to bed.

8183
08:51:20,959 --> 08:51:26,439
Final attack.

8184
08:51:26,439 --> 08:51:34,319
I didn't even want to aggro these and now I have to fight him.

8185
08:51:34,319 --> 08:51:35,419
All right, please just leave me alone.

8186
08:51:35,419 --> 08:51:36,319
I'm going to close the door.

8187
08:51:36,319 --> 08:51:59,130
Whatever.

8188
08:51:59,130 --> 08:52:01,689
He was just acting weird.

8189
08:52:01,689 --> 08:52:13,569
He was just acting weird.

8190
08:52:13,569 --> 08:52:13,869
What?

8191
08:52:13,869 --> 08:52:22,310
Oh, well, come on then.

8192
08:52:22,310 --> 08:52:42,299
You're going to come down here then come over here.

8193
08:52:42,299 --> 08:52:44,970
You got to be kidding me.

8194
08:52:44,970 --> 08:52:45,970
Oh my goodness.

8195
08:52:45,970 --> 08:52:48,080
This is bad.

8196
08:52:48,080 --> 08:53:12,400
This is very bad.

8197
08:53:12,400 --> 08:53:13,700
Stupid.

8198
08:53:13,700 --> 08:53:14,700
You're stupid.

8199
08:53:14,700 --> 08:53:36,860
You're stupid.

8200
08:53:36,860 --> 08:53:41,020
Do I just eat the pair of shoes and not even care?

8201
08:53:41,020 --> 08:53:43,900
Shit.

8202
08:53:43,900 --> 08:53:44,400
All right.

8203
08:53:44,400 --> 08:53:44,799
All right.

8204
08:53:44,799 --> 08:53:45,099
All right.

8205
08:53:45,099 --> 08:53:45,400
I'm out.

8206
08:53:45,400 --> 08:53:45,599
I'm out.

8207
08:53:45,599 --> 08:53:51,509
I'll see you later.

8208
08:53:51,509 --> 08:53:52,209
It's fun.

8209
08:53:52,209 --> 08:53:52,810
It's fun.

8210
08:53:52,810 --> 08:53:57,209
It's fun.

8211
08:53:57,209 --> 08:53:58,639
It's fun.

8212
08:53:58,639 --> 08:54:07,549
I still think this is too hard though.

8213
08:54:07,549 --> 08:54:13,110
I love it.

8214
08:54:13,110 --> 08:54:22,439
No fun didn't for you.

8215
08:54:22,439 --> 08:54:23,540
I want to do this.

8216
08:54:23,540 --> 08:54:31,939
I this is so stressful, but I want to do it.

8217
08:54:31,939 --> 08:54:37,680
Part of me feels like you gear up here and you take your gear here,

8218
08:54:37,680 --> 08:54:40,479
but I almost feel like I could play here without needing being being

8219
08:54:40,479 --> 08:54:44,659
able to be geared because you need to be kind of geared for this.

8220
08:54:44,659 --> 08:55:02,549
I went to sleep and you're still streaming.

8221
08:55:02,549 --> 08:55:05,729
Show stash.

8222
08:55:05,729 --> 08:55:05,930
Right.

8223
08:55:05,930 --> 08:55:08,029
Let me make some people very happy, right?

8224
08:55:08,029 --> 08:55:13,080
No, no, no, no.

8225
08:55:13,080 --> 08:55:15,180
I like my stray gold coins.

8226
08:55:15,180 --> 08:55:24,299
One more.

8227
08:55:24,299 --> 08:55:27,200
No, I just thought I was going to eat a pair of shoes if I did one more

8228
08:55:27,200 --> 08:57:13,900
and I yeah, I'm very tired.

8229
08:57:13,900 --> 08:58:03,029
Oh my elbow.

8230
08:58:03,029 --> 08:58:04,229
I was going to smell it.

8231
08:58:04,229 --> 08:58:11,650
Fuck you.

8232
08:58:11,650 --> 08:58:14,950
Just so anytime I open my stash people just like whoa, dude.

8233
08:58:14,950 --> 08:58:40,080
What is going on with you?

8234
08:58:40,080 --> 08:58:40,779
I'm going to bed.

8235
08:58:40,779 --> 08:58:41,759
I'll see you later.

8236
08:58:41,759 --> 08:58:42,259
I'm going to bed.

8237
08:58:42,259 --> 08:58:50,939
I was going to write a huge you.

8238
08:58:50,939 --> 08:58:53,020
Well, now I got to fix it.

8239
08:58:53,020 --> 08:58:55,119
Let me fix it.

8240
08:58:55,119 --> 08:59:00,840
Is there an auto corrected like an auto stash button?

8241
08:59:00,840 --> 08:59:02,159
Waiter.

8242
08:59:02,159 --> 08:59:02,659
All right.

8243
08:59:02,659 --> 08:59:04,240
I'll see you later.

8244
08:59:04,240 --> 08:59:04,740
Yeah.

8245
08:59:04,740 --> 08:59:05,740
I'm out.

8246
08:59:05,740 --> 08:59:09,139
Take care.

8247
08:59:09,139 --> 08:59:14,060
Thanks for watching everybody.

8248
08:59:14,060 --> 08:59:29,090
See you guys on Friday for more.

8249
08:59:29,090 --> 08:59:34,029
And then I think what's probably on Saturday or Sunday,

8250
08:59:34,029 --> 08:59:36,740
unless I don't know.

8251
08:59:36,740 --> 08:59:39,590
Ster and I were planning on doing some Elden Ring,

8252
08:59:39,590 --> 08:59:53,509
but you know, who knows?

8253
08:59:53,509 --> 08:59:56,119
It'll be dark and darker again.

8254
08:59:56,119 --> 08:59:57,919
Ster is going to be very upset if he hears that.

8255
08:59:57,919 --> 09:00:01,729
Don't tell him that.

8256
09:00:01,830 --> 09:00:02,330
Hey, dude.

8257
09:00:02,330 --> 09:00:05,909
Jerma was talking about how he wanted to maybe play dark and

8258
09:00:05,909 --> 09:00:08,560
darker instead on like Sunday.

8259
09:00:08,560 --> 09:00:18,700
Don't tell him that.

8260
09:00:18,700 --> 09:00:20,500
No, we probably we all jokes aside.

8261
09:00:20,500 --> 09:00:22,099
We probably will do Elden Ring.

8262
09:00:22,099 --> 09:00:22,700
I don't know.

8263
09:00:22,700 --> 09:00:24,200
Maybe Ster gets into it.

8264
09:00:24,200 --> 09:00:24,700
We'll see.

8265
09:00:24,700 --> 09:00:25,799
So everything's all up in the air.

8266
09:00:25,799 --> 09:00:29,119
Everything's good, but that's going to be it.

8267
09:00:29,119 --> 09:00:30,630
Thanks for watching everybody.

8268
09:00:30,630 --> 09:00:34,130
See you guys on Friday starting kind of probably around this

8269
09:00:34,130 --> 09:00:36,830
maybe a little bit earlier defending but probably around

8270
09:00:36,830 --> 09:00:40,529
the same time kind of a night streamer.

8271
09:00:40,529 --> 09:00:43,209
Now, I really like it.

8272
09:00:43,209 --> 09:00:46,060
I like this schedule.

8273
09:00:46,159 --> 09:00:47,659
I know a lot of people are not going to be happy to hear

8274
09:00:47,659 --> 09:00:57,959
that, but yeah, that was a lot of fun Friday going to try

8275
09:00:57,959 --> 09:01:00,150
to cycle in some other people.

8276
09:01:00,150 --> 09:01:03,860
I know Italics mentioned he kind of wanted to play it.

8277
09:01:03,860 --> 09:01:07,750
I was kind of pinging people to see me and Will.

8278
09:01:07,750 --> 09:01:10,189
Me and Will Neff were talking about it to try to find the

8279
09:01:10,189 --> 09:01:10,990
right opportunity to play.

8280
09:01:10,990 --> 09:01:16,049
Maybe he's very good people.

8281
09:01:16,049 --> 09:01:21,430
So also if poke wants to play like I would play with poke

8282
09:01:21,430 --> 09:01:23,529
and a lot of people are playing this right now.

8283
09:01:23,529 --> 09:01:26,659
So obviously want to try to jump around and play as many

8284
09:01:26,659 --> 09:01:27,259
people as I can.

8285
09:01:27,259 --> 09:01:54,639
Well, it's while it's live gonna be a lot of credits.

8286
09:01:54,639 --> 09:01:55,340
Oh shit.

8287
09:01:55,340 --> 09:01:55,939
Oh my god.

8288
09:01:55,939 --> 09:01:58,939
Yeah, all the all the subs from Ashley.

8289
09:01:59,240 --> 09:02:04,689
Yeah, I don't those of you that don't know.

8290
09:02:04,689 --> 09:02:06,590
I don't shout out subs anymore.

8291
09:02:08,630 --> 09:02:10,430
I really appreciate anybody that subs to this channel,

8292
09:02:10,430 --> 09:02:15,549
but there are a lot of people on Twitch on YouTube,

8293
09:02:15,549 --> 09:02:15,950
whatever.

8294
09:02:18,470 --> 09:02:20,569
I think your sub would probably better used on them.

8295
09:02:24,790 --> 09:02:25,790
I do appreciate the support.

8296
09:02:25,790 --> 09:02:30,099
I know it's some it's crazy to see that kind of support

8297
09:02:30,099 --> 09:02:33,040
but there's definitely a lot of people on this platform

8298
09:02:33,040 --> 09:02:45,029
that you should be given that to but I appreciate it.

8299
09:02:45,029 --> 09:02:47,830
People are already in pokes chat telling you want to play

8300
09:02:47,830 --> 09:02:48,430
LOL.

8301
09:02:50,000 --> 09:02:51,900
That's how this that's how the streamers communicate.

8302
09:02:51,900 --> 09:02:56,419
You know streamer one says, oh, yeah, that would be fun.

8303
09:02:56,419 --> 09:02:59,319
And then streamer ones chat goes to streamer twos chat

8304
09:02:59,520 --> 09:03:04,159
immediately saying let's go that's how it works.

8305
09:03:07,990 --> 09:03:09,790
Yeah, we communicate through proxy.

8306
09:03:09,790 --> 09:03:10,290
That's true.

8307
09:03:16,549 --> 09:03:19,450
This game sucks play Steve Jackson sorcery the greatest

8308
09:03:19,450 --> 09:03:22,049
game ever made in the history of mankind.

8309
09:03:22,900 --> 09:03:40,470
This game definitely does not suck.

8310
09:03:40,669 --> 09:03:41,669
Please finish sorcery.

8311
09:03:42,599 --> 09:03:45,970
Yeah, I know once some of this new stuff dies down.

8312
09:03:45,970 --> 09:03:56,029
There'll be a lot of stuff to just jump into was last time

8313
09:03:56,029 --> 09:04:00,189
we felt this way about a game maybe Fistful of Frags

8314
09:04:04,759 --> 09:04:07,340
Elden Ring Bloodborne.

8315
09:04:07,439 --> 09:04:09,040
I mean if you're talking about multiplayer games and

8316
09:04:09,040 --> 09:04:17,759
Fistful of Frags is probably the last one I would tell

8317
09:04:17,759 --> 09:04:20,159
I think Fistful of Frags is one of the best FPS is to

8318
09:04:20,159 --> 09:04:23,240
ever be made that game was so unbelievably fun.

8319
09:04:26,340 --> 09:04:32,340
I've said that on camera before that's one of the best

8320
09:04:32,340 --> 09:04:49,189
FPS is playing Fistful of Frags when you got that

8321
09:04:50,500 --> 09:04:53,900
that 007 Golden Eye Golden Gun the thing that killed

8322
09:04:53,900 --> 09:04:57,520
people in one shot, but it was super slow.

8323
09:04:57,959 --> 09:05:01,689
It was ba-boom, ba-boom.

8324
09:05:02,740 --> 09:05:04,139
I loved that weapon.

8325
09:05:04,340 --> 09:05:04,939
You found it.

8326
09:05:04,939 --> 09:05:06,939
It had six bullets in it Walker.

8327
09:05:06,939 --> 09:05:07,340
Yep.

8328
09:05:09,599 --> 09:05:10,500
Maybe we'll play that too.

8329
09:05:10,900 --> 09:05:12,669
Some point that game is so good.

8330
09:05:18,939 --> 09:05:19,240
Don't worry.

8331
09:05:19,240 --> 09:05:20,740
I'm going to send more to smaller streamers.

8332
09:05:20,740 --> 09:05:21,240
Oh hell.

8333
09:05:21,240 --> 09:05:21,540
Yeah.

8334
09:05:22,310 --> 09:05:28,110
Good to know also take care of yourself too, though.

8335
09:05:30,569 --> 09:05:32,470
I don't know what your financial situation looks like

8336
09:05:32,470 --> 09:05:35,700
and I'm not going to pretend to but take care of yourself

8337
09:05:35,700 --> 09:05:36,000
too.

8338
09:05:36,099 --> 09:05:36,700
That's important.

8339
09:05:44,580 --> 09:05:48,659
They added horses ones.

8340
09:05:48,659 --> 09:05:49,459
You can ride.

8341
09:05:58,130 --> 09:06:00,430
I'll see you guys Friday Friday evening.

8342
09:06:05,029 --> 09:06:08,209
Thanks to obviously the Vinnie, Ster, Caleb.

8343
09:06:12,470 --> 09:06:14,370
I want to try to jump in a game with Kraiken too.

8344
09:06:14,769 --> 09:06:16,370
Kraiken and the group he was playing with.

8345
09:06:17,319 --> 09:06:19,419
We had a DM group where we just kind of like oh who's

8346
09:06:19,419 --> 09:06:22,199
around and they we kind of filled out and we had two

8347
09:06:22,199 --> 09:06:25,819
different separate groups going so try to get a few

8348
09:06:25,819 --> 09:06:27,519
games to Kraiken as well this Friday.

8349
09:06:30,040 --> 09:06:31,040
Yeah, take care of yourselves.

8350
09:06:31,040 --> 09:06:31,440
Good night.

8351
09:06:32,360 --> 09:06:34,260
Get some water get some sleep or good morning.

8352
09:06:35,959 --> 09:06:36,459
See you soon.

8353
09:06:44,059 --> 09:06:47,519
Have a great night or enjoy your breakfast.

8354
09:06:52,889 --> 09:06:53,389
See you later.
