1
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:35,640
How's it going? How we doing? We doing good? He's early. Yeah, I am early. I am- I'm very early. I

2
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:48,359
am at least four minutes early today. Very interesting. I could- I could be way earlier

3
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:58,229
too, couldn't I? I could have showed up at 3.50. You know, I saw the messages. It's always late.

4
00:00:58,869 --> 00:01:09,829
It's always delaying. But you know what? Not today. There is a lot of stuff to talk about today.

5
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:19,659
Let's start. The first thing that we're going to talk about is Katamari Damacy. I'm going to

6
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:28,980
be finishing it today. We love Katamari. We love Katamari. I was going to do some beanies,

7
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:41,980
but pre-stream chose differently. That's what it is. Why are you doing this? You could be eating a

8
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:50,099
big bowl of soup right now. I think soup is probably the worst stream snack. I don't think

9
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:57,269
that works very well. Imagine some streamer is eating a bowl of fucking soup in the middle

10
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:19,430
and soup does not work. You ever have a bread bowl? Yeah, they're amazing. Bread bowl and

11
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:27,780
broccoli cheddar soup. Pretty good. Yeah, we have a lot of stuff going on today. So we're

12
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:36,900
going to do Katamari. Finish Katamari. And later, Final Fantasy 16 sponsor segment for the demo.

13
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:46,439
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We'll do that after. We're going to finish Katamari

14
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:56,419
before we do that. We're not going to jump right into that. Hashtag ad. That's right.

15
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:11,300
Do you like Final Fantasy? I have not played a Final Fantasy in probably 10 years, but this one

16
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:22,819
caught my attention because it's action combat. I think the last time I played Final Fantasy

17
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:32,520
I was probably, I don't know, maybe Final Fantasy 4? Final Fantasy 5? But it's kind of like DMC.

18
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:42,900
Really? Interesting. Can you play something else? I don't want to be spoiled on Katamari.

19
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:59,610
It's all good. Katamari is fine. What about TF2? Yeah, that's the idea. Eventually maybe

20
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:04,889
play some Man vs Machine. Let me clarify the record here for a lot of people that probably

21
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:09,129
were expecting. Like I said the words TF2 and I think a lot of people were like,

22
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:17,370
he's going to play TF2 again. Hold on. I don't know. I think I want to play Man vs Machine.

23
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,050
I don't know if I want to. I don't know what's going to happen with that.

24
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:30,439
So it's just an idea. He confirmed it. What about Peggle? You know we're playing Peggle.

25
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:40,040
Just not Peggle 2. We're playing the original one. What about Zoombinis?

26
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:48,759
Well, Zoombinis is the next game we're playing. The next game we're playing.

27
00:04:49,240 --> 00:05:02,790
So here's how it's going to play out. Katamari Debassi today. Final Fantasy 16 sponsor segment

28
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:13,740
today. Zoombinis. Another day. Like in the next few days. After Zoombinis. Sorcery. Lined up.

29
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:25,779
Sorcery. I told you we were doing it on the 24th but I lied. We're actually doing it. No,

30
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:33,060
we're probably still doing it on the 24th. Somewhere in the middle of that. There's more

31
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:49,430
shit to do. Something else. Dress that time you did a wet fart? Um, nah. It happens. It's all right.

32
00:05:50,069 --> 00:06:09,850
When are you going to play Skyrim? Okay, this is not the game request hour. We're just going

33
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:13,370
over the schedule for the next, like the things that I want to do for the next week or two.

34
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:22,500
Remember, what about the something else? Oh, what about the something else? Yeah, there was

35
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:31,350
something else too. Forget what it was. What was it? I don't remember. Is there something else?

36
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:38,360
Stalling? No, not really. Just chilling. Just waiting for people to come in. Because we're

37
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:46,230
going to play Katamari. Oh, and something else. Not, no, I don't think I'm ever going to play

38
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:54,970
Yakuza. I'm really sorry everybody, but I don't think that's going to happen. It's been so long.

39
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:59,029
What's the, you guys have been watching, some of you guys have been watching for years.

40
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:07,189
What is the period where if we cross that period, there's no way I will do it. No way.

41
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:14,250
Let's say I play something and a certain amount of time goes by and I have never gone back.

42
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:33,079
A few days? Really? A few days? No, it's got to be like a week. Really? Yeah, it's at least

43
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:41,350
a couple of weeks. I know. I just move on so quickly. I really do. It's been nine months

44
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:51,699
since you played Sorcery. Yeah. Open up Street Fighter real quick then. Yeah. Are you done

45
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:56,259
with Breath of the Wild? It's been a few weeks. Oh shit. You're right. It actually has been a

46
00:07:56,259 --> 00:08:19,860
few weeks. Who cares? Who cares? Yakuza zero one the rumble. It is owed as an extra stream. Yeah,

47
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:33,259
it's not fair. It's genuinely completely fucking unfair. I do have something I want to talk about

48
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:41,769
though. This is the something else. The something else is what I'm about to tell you. So I've been

49
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:49,509
stalling as of right now. Are you ready for a major, major fucking announcement?

50
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:59,379
This is a major announcement. Okay, here we go. He's going for it. He's going for it.

51
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:10,570
As of today, I am now the official chief creative officer of off brand. Let's go.

52
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:21,799
Oh shit. That was kind of loud. Chief creative officer for off brand. If you don't know what

53
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:27,000
off brand is, this is good news. This is really good news. This is great news. I don't know why

54
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:37,769
people, why are people expecting bad news? Off brand. If you know Ludwig, Ludwig started a company.

55
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:44,820
I want to say a year ago now or so. We've been talking back and forth. It's been a long time

56
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:57,289
in the making. No, I'm not pregnant. So I think I want to, let's just talk real quickly about this

57
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:03,669
because, oh shit, I'm still on my like starting soon screen. Oh fuck. Oh God. Hold on.

58
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:09,539
Over the last couple of years, I think a lot of you guys have, you know, I didn't even set up my

59
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:13,860
webcam. Oh no, this is not good. It's all right. Whatever. It's all good. I'll just turn this off.

60
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:21,750
It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. Here. Well, I'll give you something else to look at.

61
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:26,419
There you go. Okay. There's like birds in the background and shit. Okay. Here we go.

62
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:31,179
So I want to say like two or three years ago, we talked a lot on this stream about where I

63
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:35,879
wanted to be in the future. And this is all kind of real talk right now. I don't want to,

64
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:40,980
um, little jokes aside, I want to kind of get real for a little bit. I want to say two or three

65
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:47,769
years ago, I talked on stream. I want to say over the course of three or four months about I want

66
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:55,990
to do shows. I want to make stuff and I want to help people make shit too. And I floated the idea

67
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:01,529
around of like after streaming, right? Like what did I want to do when I was done streaming? And

68
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:05,159
some of that, you know, I remember talking to some of you guys in the community being like,

69
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:11,559
hey, what if I helped people make shows? What if I got, I try to be in a company and be a creative

70
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:17,620
director or a creative consultant or something like that. And I was approached by off-brand

71
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:23,799
to do that very thing. So I am insanely excited to work with the off-brand team, the off-brand

72
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:31,289
productions team with obviously with Ludwig, with stands, with, uh, there's all kinds of people

73
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:44,539
in this company now. He's doing his career voice. Let me tell you what this is not. Oh shit. It's

74
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:48,299
no, no, no, no. Okay. So I know that I knew that a lot of people are going to be saying that. So

75
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:57,620
let me, let's address it. Let's address it. Company Andy, company Andy. Okay. The streams going forward.

76
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,299
I'm not done streaming by the way. I don't know where you're getting that from. I never told you

77
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:16,039
that. I'm still here. I ain't going anywhere. I'm not going anywhere. No. Yeah. Still here. But I

78
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:23,860
think my focus is going to be obviously I'm going to be splitting time and I want to spend a bunch

79
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,779
of time with off-brand because there's a lot of shows to do. There's a lot of things that I really

80
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:36,570
want to bring to the table. Do you have a speech ready? This is the speech. Uh, streams are going

81
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:42,220
to operate pretty much as normally. I don't think there's going to be a pretty major change, at least

82
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:48,980
right now. I mean, there's always a but, right? I definitely want to spend a lot of time on the

83
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:56,659
project that they're going to be putting me on. So I am very, very excited. I, uh, I've been,

84
00:12:56,659 --> 00:13:01,750
do you understand how hard it's been to not tell you guys this? I think off-brand was going to

85
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:06,470
fucking strangle me, but I, there's been so many times where I'm like, Oh, when I tell everyone,

86
00:13:06,549 --> 00:13:24,299
can I tell people this? They grow up so fast. No, no, no, no. So what this means is there's going

87
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:29,100
to be a lot of things that you're going to see that comes from off-brand that I will have had

88
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:34,659
a hand in. If you saw the Ranboo show, Ranboo show was not part of off-brand. I'm just giving

89
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:42,200
an example. That was a little bit of this already kind of working with Ranboo and talking to him

90
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,840
and being like, what do you want? What's your vision? What do you want to do for this scene?

91
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:50,899
And for this part of the show, whatever, breaking down scenes and writing stuff and helping with

92
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:56,620
creative direction, I am so fortunate and so happy to be able to say that that's what I'm

93
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:03,159
going to be able to do. Now I didn't have that huge of involvement in Ranboo show, but I, you know,

94
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:07,240
I was consulting on a few things, but now as a creative officer and a creative director,

95
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:18,519
whatever you want to call it, I'm going to be involved in almost everything that off-brand does.

96
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:24,090
And it's great because they're all awesome. I get along really, really well with Ludwig, of course,

97
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:35,299
obviously, with all the rest of the off-brand group. I'm going to cry. No, don't do it. Don't

98
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:42,519
cry. You're going to, I'm telling you right now, you better not start crying. I'm fine. I'm so glad

99
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:51,129
the fucking webcam isn't on. Now I'm excited. This is going to be really cool. We'll see how it goes.

100
00:14:51,129 --> 00:15:06,360
Do a face cam sobbing stream. Yeah. So, hey, when you see that off-brand is working on something

101
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:15,139
in the future. Yeah, this is official. I got to retweet it too. And this is all still very new.

102
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:20,100
So obviously there's still a lot that has to happen with I got to get completely onboarded

103
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,100
into the company. We have a lot of meetings to do before it's like I actually start working on

104
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:37,129
something. So we're in the very early stages, but it is official. So let's just keep doing what we

105
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:44,419
were doing. I guess the only thing that you guys really need to know in the future is I am going

106
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:50,169
to continue to stream and I'm going to continue to stream kind of when I want to and when I feel

107
00:15:50,169 --> 00:15:57,370
like it. And when I think it's going to be a fun thing. Now, let me reiterate what that means.

108
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:04,549
That could mean anything. That could mean five days in a row. That could mean once in a week.

109
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:09,269
That could mean, I mean, think about when the Elden Ring DLC comes out. You're talking about

110
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:18,299
literally that's going to be all day every day. But I do have to make it really clear that I

111
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:28,600
have a job now. He still hasn't tweeted about his card game, by the way. I've got a few tweets

112
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:34,549
I've got to make. All right. I've got a few tweets. Oh, this motherfucker went corporate already.

113
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:48,279
But yeah, you're not going to see that much of a difference. I'm just telling you, I am an employee

114
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:57,820
of a company now and I have duties that I have to do. So this is not, I'm still here. We're obviously

115
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:07,099
streaming right now. We're obviously streaming. I'm not going anywhere. I don't plan on it either.

116
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:14,420
Keep it real. I'm keeping it real. Yeah, I'm keeping it real right now. You better watch what

117
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:22,730
you say now on stream. No, no, no, no, it's fine. Look, I'll prove it to you. I just announced that

118
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:28,220
and I'll just say a bunch of bad words, right? So then you know that this is like not changing

119
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:37,799
anything. Poopoo penis poopoo. See, it's fine. I still have a job. Wait, I just got something.

120
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:52,329
Where's this from? Off brand corporate, was it? Whatever. Now, I don't want to give you guys,

121
00:17:53,930 --> 00:18:01,339
I'm insanely excited. I cannot wait to get started on projects and I hope I do a good job.

122
00:18:01,339 --> 00:18:04,940
I hope I actually do a good job. That's what I really want to do. I really want to work with

123
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:09,579
creators and streamers, YouTubers, whoever that wants to do something that will come through off

124
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:16,440
brand and we'll talk and we'll develop it. I'm going to do my best. Hopefully I can make everybody,

125
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:21,740
especially everybody here that's been watching the shows and watching the stuff that I've been

126
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:27,480
doing for so long. I just hope that you like the stuff that I do over there too, because I'm going

127
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,640
to put the same effort, the same time. I'm going to put as much as I can into each one of these

128
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:44,779
things. Let's play Katamari. What's the process going to be like working for off brand? Well,

129
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:54,869
that's a good question considering today's my first day. So, okay. What do we do? I was going

130
00:18:54,869 --> 00:19:00,220
to walk into the office with a cup of coffee in my hands and be like, all right guys, what do we do?

131
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:06,359
What do I do? What do you want me to do? I'm going to have a whiteboard. I'm going to just

132
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:15,640
pull off the top of the whiteboard pen with my teeth to be like, all right, I got an idea.

133
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,170
We got you. We're going to get you up on a podium. You're going to be given a presidential

134
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:23,769
presidential speech. That's where it starts. I'm going to write presidential speech, right?

135
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:27,109
And I'm going to go bullet by bullet, right? Bullet line to bullet line.

136
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:42,200
Fuck, I have to retweet that. Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. I know I don't want to repeat myself

137
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,799
that much, but the whole studio seems like it's going to be a really, really great venture.

138
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:55,430
Let's go ahead and retweet this because come on, look at that. Chief creative officer. Come on, Ma.

139
00:19:55,430 --> 00:20:05,900
Hey Ma, I got a job. Hey Ma, I got a job. Oh yes, it only took him until he was 40.

140
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:19,079
It only took him until he was 40. But yeah, let's just keep going. That's the news. That's the thing

141
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:29,130
I've been wanting to share for a little while. It's shocking. I haven't told you it yet. This

142
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:36,890
feels like a milestone. I think it kind of is for me because I mean, we do make the 40 year old joke,

143
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:42,089
but I think there's still a lot of stuff I really want to do. And there's a lot of things that I

144
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:49,180
really have left, I think, to say. No, I'm not quitting streaming. I know a lot of people think

145
00:20:49,180 --> 00:21:03,059
that's what this is. That's not what this is. Welcome to the workforce. It's the job that you

146
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:08,039
said you always wanted. I think that's the most important thing to take away from this. This is

147
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:12,279
like I told you a couple of years ago, I've talked about it. This is the thing that I really wanted

148
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:19,420
to do and I hope I do a good job. And if it is, if it goes the way that I think it's going to go,

149
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:29,210
then I'm ready to work. The job is chief creative officer at off brand. Those of you that are just

150
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:44,220
trickling in that didn't hear or didn't see the tweet. White collar, white collar Andy. Yeah.

151
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:50,119
Are you going to move? I don't, I, I don't, I don't know. All these things have to be taken

152
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:54,410
into consideration eventually in the future. I don't know. I'm just going to take it really

153
00:21:54,410 --> 00:22:08,680
one step at a time. Wait, he's the chief, he's the chief creative officer. That's right. He's the

154
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:26,089
chief. No, I like Vegas though. I think I'll probably stick around for a while. Let me turn

155
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:46,579
up the chief Elvertson. All right. Hello, honey. You're so floating. You make it look easy.

156
00:22:46,579 --> 00:22:53,990
Flying is actually hard work, isn't it? But roll up clouds. We thought this was about flying. When

157
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:59,829
did we finish talking? Like you can even roll up clouds. I want to be like the king when I grow up.

158
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:05,690
My gosh. Don't give up. Clouds can be rolled up. No doubt. Of course they can.

159
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:18,869
Come to think of it, we did in Katamari Damassi. Crew chief Elvertson. Are you still going to do

160
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:24,230
your own event streams? Yeah. Stuff. I, I know I, I want to make sure I've, I'm a broken record

161
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:31,450
on this, but I want to make sure I'm very clear. Me working for off brand and being a position at

162
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:37,059
off brand does not mean that I will not do anything anymore. That is not what that means.

163
00:23:37,859 --> 00:23:43,480
It just means that I'm going to be spending a lot of time working on shows with off brand.

164
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,240
A lot of those shows that I would want to do too, will probably just be with off brand.

165
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:56,970
Of course they will. Right? So it's, it's mainly a, I have another set of duties to do that are not

166
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:06,650
just streaming. That's what this announcement is about. All right. We have way. I'm already this

167
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:25,380
big. He said duty. I did. Why did I have to scream let's go after I announced it? I just like,

168
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:32,740
I was like nervous. The one like clippable moment of like, I am chief creative officer for off

169
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:45,240
brand. Let's go. What the fuck? God damn it. Oh, I'm all the way up here. Let's go. Great.

170
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:57,799
Wait, how, how do I pick up anything? Oh, I see. Are you going to star in some off brand

171
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:05,420
shows or will you be mainly behind the scenes? It really depends on what it is. I just want

172
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:25,059
to participate. I can't pick anything up. I only have three clouds total. Which ones can I pick up

173
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:35,740
and not pick up? I'm going to know what the fuck is going on right now. Oh, it's these little,

174
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:53,059
little ones. Hey, dude, you're going to watch the golden Knights game tomorrow. Yep. Looking

175
00:25:53,059 --> 00:26:11,619
for the sweep. Can I go fast up here? All right. I might have to redo this one. It's not going to

176
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:30,099
be a sweep. Yeah, it's all right. Here we go. Wait, get this guy. One thing. Let me check one

177
00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:44,069
thing real quick. Sure. I didn't miss anything here. Okay. Good. I haven't even grown at all.

178
00:26:46,839 --> 00:27:17,220
Oh yeah. I had to check my work email. Where are the clouds? I get, wait, cousin. Work email is a

179
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:26,740
weird way for you to pronounce solitaire. I don't even know how to play solitaire.

180
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:33,640
All right. So let me just correct that. I don't understand how solitaire works. And anytime

181
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,880
somebody tries to explain to me solitaire, I just stopped paying attention after the first 10 seconds

182
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:57,819
because it's just like, I don't, I don't even care. This was pretty bad. It's all right. It's

183
00:27:57,819 --> 00:28:10,809
not even 200 clouds. This is an embarrassment. Chief creative officer of off brand Kansas

184
00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:19,460
and not have to have a display like this. You know what I'm saying? I have at least 250.

185
00:28:28,069 --> 00:28:31,670
I was thinking about, I didn't want to be like a weirdo about it or anything, but I was thinking

186
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:36,069
about going live and just being like, oh yeah, chief creative officer for off brand and just be

187
00:28:36,069 --> 00:28:41,690
wicked mean for the whole stream. And then you'd be like, uh, yeah, uh, you're talking to the chief

188
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:45,180
creative officer of off brand. Like, do you know what the fuck you've been talking about?

189
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:50,869
And just have it just be like a nightmare. All right. That's all right. We're just getting started.

190
00:28:53,819 --> 00:29:13,289
That would not go well. That's how your normal streams are. Massive ego. I'll move the cursor. I

191
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:23,660
got it. 60% possibility of rain. There's no Katamari Damacy without fans. Well, let's roll

192
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:36,599
up more clouds. All right. That was pretty 57%. It's not good. Should we add chief creative officer

193
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:43,400
at off brand to the stream tags? Yeah. Yeah. That sounds pretty good to me. Yeah, definitely.

194
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:54,859
A hundred percent. I like that a lot. Who would ever type that in to the search on Twitch?

195
00:29:56,539 --> 00:30:03,339
Okay. Twitch show me streams of chief creative officers of off brand. Oh, there's only one. Oh,

196
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:18,730
okay. Do they know that you only have a 98.5 IQ? Yeah. Hey, they didn't hire me because I'm smart.

197
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:30,890
Maybe they did. Who said clearly? All right. Whoever said clearly timed them out. I made a

198
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:43,079
little joke and they said clearly and I want them timed out for five minutes. You're creative officer,

199
00:30:43,079 --> 00:31:00,440
not intelligent officer. Chief creator of shitting pants. That would probably get more hits on the

200
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:11,900
tag on Twitch than that one. Let's do who's new. Are you new? Who's new? You're new. Nice to meet

201
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:17,539
you, your highness. Katamari Damacy is really fun making stars. That's so cool. So I kind of ended

202
00:31:17,539 --> 00:31:23,380
up, I missed it. I can't get the, I really want to see a new Saturn that fits this ring just right.

203
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:41,779
Your highness, I'm totally asking you, please make a new Saturn, please. All right. This one's

204
00:31:41,779 --> 00:31:47,210
actually really good because this is just like a, all right. You just like, you twisted the knife

205
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:56,730
a little. I like it. It's funny. Chief, where is it? It was funny. Chief visual learning officer

206
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:12,539
at off-brand. Yeah. Come on. All jokes aside though, I'm going to try to do as best I can.

207
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:19,140
I really am. There's a lot of people that have a lot of cool ideas. I would love to develop them

208
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:31,299
with them. Hope I do a good job. We are what we are because of our tights, safe and snug,

209
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:47,460
fit and fab. That's how we'll make this Katamari. And you do a Microsoft Excel stream because now

210
00:32:47,460 --> 00:33:00,099
you're an executive. Well, I don't know how to use Excel. Okay. 20 centimeters is about this big.

211
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:11,910
Ready? Here it is. Okay. So that's how big it is. All right. It's all yours. Okay. So I have to make

212
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:34,980
a 20 centimeter ball. I have a no time limit. 20 centimeters, by the way. Do you even know how to

213
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:47,480
use Microsoft Word? I know that a popular belief would have you think that I write all of my ideas

214
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:54,789
and all of my shows on like a bag of a napkin. That's kind of, I mean, that's somewhat true.

215
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:08,440
Ludwig tweeted. What did he say? Derma being my coworker is now the coolest thing about me.

216
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,199
He's such a cool fucking dude. He really is.

217
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:33,829
Oh, I'm excited, man. Let's, let's do some cool shit. My first order of business

218
00:34:36,280 --> 00:35:07,699
is in the company break room. There must be mini M&Ms. Not even fucking looking at the game.

219
00:35:10,739 --> 00:35:14,820
I've been just walking into walls, just reading chat and looking over at bod chat.

220
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:21,539
It's a big day. All right. Like we're going to retry. It's kind of, it's kind of a wild day today.

221
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:27,210
OK, I need to make it 20 centimeters.

222
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,500
Oh, there's no time limit. It's OK. But I wasn't paying attention. Now I'm going to

223
00:35:38,539 --> 00:36:00,630
pick up the chocolate beatbox now. OK, this is me.

224
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:26,099
If we were in the break room. Hold on. What are you saying?

225
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:35,429
I'm sorry. It's a big day. If you were in a break room, you would have another apple juice.

226
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:41,820
What? Oh, you mean like I would take apple? Well, whatever. They already know all this.

227
00:36:42,780 --> 00:37:00,420
This is getting close. I wouldn't say it's there yet. I think after all these glues.

228
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:13,739
What do you think? It's almost there. A little bit more.

229
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:29,179
I think this is good. Yeah, this is it right here. I'm going to say that's it.

230
00:37:30,219 --> 00:37:45,559
Might be too big. Who knows? All right, let's find out. I just show up to work

231
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:53,460
and your boss is never wearing pants or underwear. Wait, what? Why did I read that?

232
00:37:53,460 --> 00:38:08,500
Wait, why did I just read that? Why did I read that? I read that so nonchalantly like it was

233
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:14,579
just a regular message. Oh, man, there's no wear pants and no underwear. What the fuck?

234
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:28,039
I didn't want to read that. I just kept reading and reading and reading and reading and it just

235
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:34,389
didn't stop. Why do you read the most unhinged messages? Well, I don't know, because everyone's

236
00:38:34,389 --> 00:38:52,099
writing salad right now and there's one fucking weird message in the middle. Hey, wait, wait, wait,

237
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:59,130
14. OK, OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. I can do. Yeah, I can do better than that. So it has to be much

238
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:19,500
bigger than that. OK, let's do it again. Move the cursor or I'm going to call or I'm going to call

239
00:39:19,500 --> 00:40:17,699
your boss. OK. Oh, baby crying sounds. There he is. Cool. I want to do that one again. Which

240
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:39,130
one was it? This one here? It was this one, right? 20 centimeters. I can do it. It's two meters next.

241
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:58,710
Is it? Oh, we smell. Wait, this is different. Oh, they change it up on you. They don't want

242
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:09,130
you to be able to go in and just grind it. All right. Two meters. That's way. That's huge. All

243
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:32,809
right. I got to. There's two or three versions of every level. Oh, cool. Why did you just fake

244
00:41:32,809 --> 00:41:38,340
excitement? I add that was genuine excitement that I turned into fake excitement because I

245
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:42,340
didn't want anyone to bat chest me because I was genuinely excited about having three different

246
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:48,340
levels per level. And I was afraid because I was excited about something on the Internet.

247
00:41:49,300 --> 00:42:09,219
And I thought I was going to get yelled at for it. Oh, you're just just give me more power.

248
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:42,139
Give me more of them. All right. Two meters. Take my energy, Jerma.

249
00:43:03,369 --> 00:43:07,860
I just joined. Who the fuck is this guy? Oh, you from the tweet? Well,

250
00:43:09,139 --> 00:43:16,900
my name is Jerma985, Chief Creative Officer of Okran. You might know me as the guy that did that

251
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:25,289
dollhouse stream one time. You also might know me from such unbelievable bangers as meme image

252
00:43:25,289 --> 00:43:30,409
I didn't make as the most popular thing that's ever happened to this channel that had nothing

253
00:43:30,409 --> 00:43:36,809
to do with I had I didn't do it. Somebody else did. They stretched up my face and made put me

254
00:43:36,809 --> 00:44:00,219
like in an Among Us cartoon. And I also talk about food. I'm pretty strong. I think I'm at

255
00:44:00,219 --> 00:44:22,710
two meters. You may have seen me at Team Fortress two long time ago. Oh, they put it up in the

256
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:45,260
discord. That's funny. OK, did I do it? It wasn't even close. Shit. I thought I was going over.

257
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:54,860
You play Life is Strange? I did. I played the original long time ago. Pretty much when it first

258
00:44:54,860 --> 00:45:04,949
came out. All right. Well, these ones are hard. We'd like that in a Saturn. Let's pop it up.

259
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:30,679
I guess it wasn't that far off. 1.4 to 2. It is. What's this one? Oh, Your Highness really is

260
00:45:30,679 --> 00:45:36,760
resplendent. Yeah, I love studying. So I haven't played Katamari these days. I'm really sorry.

261
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:43,239
Anyway, I study so much that they cut it off. Cut off the electricity to my apartment.

262
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:48,760
I do nothing but study so I don't earn any money. That's why I didn't even notice.

263
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:53,739
But I do want to study when it's dark at night. Your Highness, can you help?

264
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:06,650
They're sharing an image in the discord right now that I cannot publicly share. But they're

265
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:14,059
sharing it nonetheless. I cannot publicly share that image. You know, it's kind of a brand issue,

266
00:46:14,059 --> 00:46:29,880
I think. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

267
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:35,079
Oh, I thought that was real. I was like, what the fuck? Somebody said, just check the website and

268
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:38,739
look at the picture they used for you. And it was me sitting naked in the chair. I was like,

269
00:46:38,739 --> 00:46:43,829
did they do that? No. All right, it's edited. Oh, shit. I was like, what the hell? I was like,

270
00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:51,619
all right, well, that's the direction. Yes, it's a little brighter. What? No, you're talking about a

271
00:46:51,619 --> 00:46:58,710
van? We forbid it. It's all about us. So much larger than life, you're the king of all cosmos,

272
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:20,699
all right. Larger than life? I agree. That's no good. Too dark is no good. Somebody said,

273
00:47:20,699 --> 00:47:35,449
I have to admit, that would be a creative photo to use. Okay, what's going on in the game?

274
00:47:35,449 --> 00:47:43,639
Anyways, this is our bookish fan studying by nothing more than the light of the moon.

275
00:47:43,639 --> 00:47:51,099
Let's give this boy a brighter future. Yes. Roll up a bunch of fireflies, then roll him up in

276
00:47:51,099 --> 00:47:56,380
the Katamari to brighten things up. If you can manage it in this time, that would be romantic.

277
00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:23,130
We know you can do it, honey. Fireflies. So just make it really bright. I'll take it slow. I don't

278
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:29,139
want to go too fast because I'll miss the little crunchies, whatever they are. Oh, fireflies. No,

279
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:51,219
they're not crunchies. Do not eat these. No, don't eat these. That's right. Okay. It's still very

280
00:48:51,219 --> 00:49:13,559
dark. Looking at some other questions and stuff. Just looking at questions. If anything rolls in

281
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:24,489
that I can answer, I will answer it. I haven't really started. So there's some things that

282
00:49:24,489 --> 00:49:30,980
off-brand is doing that I have not really participated in because obviously this announcement

283
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:37,139
today and some of the other stuff, right. Um, this is kind of starting as of production stuff

284
00:49:37,139 --> 00:49:55,829
for like as of now forward. I can't climb that. You're going to wear a suit every day. I was

285
00:49:55,829 --> 00:50:01,460
thinking about wearing a suit running on the face game and having like super Mario pajamas on my

286
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:07,639
pants and stand up at some point to get a coffee and you guys can see I was like, but I didn't have

287
00:50:07,639 --> 00:50:19,289
very much time to, I had to, I had to get out of here and then come back with like a super Mario

288
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:50,469
ice cream or something. All right. It's still dark technically. Yeah. I can't, I'm going to answer.

289
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:58,389
All right. So here's the thing. I will answer questions like, hmm, so what kind of, no,

290
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:03,909
that's such a softball question. What kind of projects do you think you'd be the most excited

291
00:51:03,909 --> 00:51:08,469
about? Like, all right, did you just, did you just give me a fucking layup? Is that really

292
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:19,210
somebody? Yeah, but I'm sorry. I'm not. Hey, Gerber, what's your, how much money are you making?

293
00:51:21,159 --> 00:51:41,260
No, I'm not going to answer these questions. It's his first day. It's my first day.

294
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:49,769
It's my first day and I'm playing Katamari Damacy. Oh shit. I'm going to get in trouble.

295
00:51:58,309 --> 00:52:02,869
Oh, hey guys. Where's, where's Gerber? We're doing our, our, you know, day one company meeting.

296
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:10,039
Where is he? Oh, he's like joking about being naked and playing Katamari Damacy. The meeting was

297
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:22,860
at 4 30. All right. If I get to bright, it should be fine. Right. Is there more over there? I don't

298
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:45,429
know. Hey, what's the best part about working with off-brand? Ah, let me answer that. Hey, Gerber,

299
00:52:45,429 --> 00:52:49,269
what would you say your level of excitement is right now? Well, I would say it's definitely at

300
00:52:49,269 --> 00:53:14,119
least like a nine or a 10. Working with off-brand to me seems like kind of bright, kind of bright.

301
00:53:14,119 --> 00:53:22,090
It's got to be pretty good. Right. Oh, um, I am itching to go. I'm itching to just get started

302
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:39,300
on a project and just start typing, get involved. If I was your intern, would you make me use me as

303
00:53:39,300 --> 00:54:10,010
a human footstool? No, I wouldn't. Is that, is that from a TV show? I'm not reading chat anymore.

304
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:16,539
Hey, I got to look, I got a sponsor segment coming up. So you can't, you can't write that shit

305
00:54:16,539 --> 00:54:23,820
anymore. Hey, I'm goddamn chief creative officer of off-brand. Okay. Let's clean it up a little.

306
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:46,389
Ooh, look, wait, it's bright. What's wrong with it? You can have this thing. Oh, it's, it's,

307
00:54:46,389 --> 00:55:04,469
it was bright. So what do you guys think? Let's get some feedback here because I all jokes aside,

308
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:20,579
I genuinely am really, really happy about this. What does off-brand do? Off-brand is a company

309
00:55:21,139 --> 00:55:44,539
that facilitates multimedia reductions. You need flashcards? No. And also to a lot of these things.

310
00:55:44,539 --> 00:55:49,420
I know a lot of people have a lot of questions and I know what we're jokingly, we are jokingly

311
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:55,260
answering them, but I be honest, I really, I need to see, we need to see how this plays out,

312
00:55:55,260 --> 00:56:01,739
what the workflow is like, what, um, how long I'm going to be spending on certain things and what,

313
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:10,440
who I'm going to be working with every day. And I actually, I, it's so new that I probably could

314
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:19,590
answer a lot of these questions in the next few weeks, but all I can tell you now is that I'm

315
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:31,289
excited. Yeah. So, uh, referencing somebody mentioned a good point, um, like the baseball

316
00:56:31,289 --> 00:56:35,849
stream, the Christmas stream, the dollhouse show, those are the kinds of things that I'm,

317
00:56:35,849 --> 00:56:39,829
I want to be working on. And not just that either. There's going to be a lot,

318
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:42,789
there's a lot of projects that are going to probably come through off-brand that are not

319
00:56:43,429 --> 00:56:52,389
dollhouse streams, dollhouse level streams. Um, I've made it pretty clear that if some,

320
00:56:52,389 --> 00:56:58,059
if there's a cool project to work on, I, I want to work on it. I don't care how much it costs or

321
00:56:58,059 --> 00:57:02,619
what, if it's, oh, well, that's not going to be that expensive or that's going to be too expensive.

322
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:05,900
I think it's just pretty much anything and everything, whatever I can put my hand into,

323
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:12,679
whatever I can try to make, um, it better if I can, whatever it is, I'm going to try to.

324
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:28,650
Will you still stream? Yes. Uh, if you missed the first part of the stream, I did

325
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:34,440
go over that a little bit. Streams are not stopping, but I do have a job

326
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:41,099
that I have to do and I'm going to have to pay attention to. So not going anywhere,

327
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:52,280
not stopping streaming. Okay. I like this one. Can I show this one? Is anybody from off-brand here?

328
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:58,090
Can I show this one, the me as the vampire? Can I show that one? That's all right. That's like

329
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:11,690
company policy. That's fine. Right. It's me as a vampire as, um, well, you'll see it in the

330
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:29,110
discord. I'm going to show it. I don't care. It's too good. It's just, it's just too funny. I have

331
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:54,389
to show it. Imagine if they used this. It's stupid. Like that's, if I've requested that,

332
00:58:54,389 --> 00:59:16,920
that would be like a personal request. What was the most important thing that led you to

333
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:22,809
this decision? That's a really good question actually. Thank you. Person that obviously did

334
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:26,969
not get planted there to say that. They really didn't. Like, I'm just fucking around. They

335
00:59:26,969 --> 00:59:34,949
actually asked a good question. Uh, so I have my most fun when I'm coming up with something to do

336
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:42,969
and as much as I love, I still genuinely enjoy hanging out and playing games and, you know,

337
00:59:42,969 --> 00:59:49,289
spending time with the stream and doing this stuff. I am at my happiest coming up with it and trying

338
00:59:49,289 --> 00:59:55,429
to execute on something just kind of wacky. Uh, and that again, that's not to say that I don't

339
00:59:55,429 --> 01:00:08,179
like streaming. What just happened? A bear for sure. Finally got one. Want to go home now?

340
01:00:08,179 --> 01:00:15,690
Oh, well, I think I'm supposed to avoid the bears. You know the rules. All right. Good luck. What

341
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:26,059
would the wait, what are the rules? I have to avoid them, right? You need to get the, how is there

342
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:57,219
a bear in front of me? Okay. I need to get a huge bear. Well, that's not fair. Okay. So I just have

343
01:00:57,219 --> 01:01:03,380
to get, I have to get huge without touching a bear. Look at that. I love my favorite thing.

344
01:01:05,559 --> 01:01:21,739
What? Oh, it's cow themed. You guys are fucking just absolutely roasting me in the sub stream.

345
01:01:24,659 --> 01:01:28,420
So many of these images are popping up. It's like, I can't even keep track of them anymore.

346
01:01:30,309 --> 01:01:41,269
Like so many of these with just a different fucked up image is popping up. What? Where?

347
01:01:41,269 --> 01:02:06,150
Oh, okay. I'm done. That was a fun one. See you tomorrow. So true. Bye. What's this Katamari?

348
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:11,590
You caught it while we were on the phone. Seriously? The cow bear? By honey? For real?

349
01:02:12,309 --> 01:02:19,059
We apologize, Mr. Cow Bear. We're rolling up such a small bear. There's no point in having such a

350
01:02:19,059 --> 01:02:25,239
small bear at the ranch. Pay attention to your surroundings when you roll. Stay calm and focused

351
01:02:25,239 --> 01:02:30,949
when rolling. Hey, it's really okay. You don't need to say you're sorry. Should have just caught

352
01:02:30,949 --> 01:02:50,820
them myself really. Oh, well we get to keep it. So we said, hey dude, why are you so popular?

353
01:02:50,820 --> 01:03:03,079
Um, I don't, I don't know. I don't know. And I don't know how popular I really am.

354
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:20,070
Yeah, I don't, am I? Is that dog still in the select plaza? Woof, it could work out. Woof.

355
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:32,150
Oh, there's a bunch of those King of the Cosmos missions too. Dog, I want to roll up the brightness.

356
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:45,219
Somebody else just wanted to do that too. If you found someone you considered funnier than yourself

357
01:03:45,219 --> 01:03:54,119
and had the chance to trade fame with them, would you? No, absolutely not. No, 100% no.

358
01:03:54,119 --> 01:04:02,739
If you're good, that's, that's good. I'm cool with being where I am. I don't,

359
01:04:02,739 --> 01:04:26,900
I don't want to trade places with anybody. What about trading consciousness with someone? Um, no.

360
01:04:27,699 --> 01:04:39,800
We have a dog among our fans. Yes, and she talks and talks this dog. Hmm, what did you say?

361
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:47,000
Woof, want to roll up? Woof, roll up the sun. We heard it. We heard it loud and clear. Yes,

362
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:53,420
we weren't hearing things amazing. Yes, our course is clear. Off to the sun we go.

363
01:04:55,880 --> 01:05:07,449
Oh, are all the main missions done? Okie dokie. Want to go for the sun? Want to roll the earth

364
01:05:07,449 --> 01:05:37,989
and roll up the sun? We know you can do it. I don't think I'm quite ready. Well, however you've seen

365
01:05:37,989 --> 01:05:44,809
this channel over the years, whether you like it or you don't, hopefully you can take something from

366
01:05:44,809 --> 01:05:54,010
it that at least, I don't know, makes you feel better. If you don't like the stream, if you don't

367
01:05:54,010 --> 01:05:59,059
like me, whatever, that's fine. If you do like this place, if you do like what's going on here,

368
01:05:59,059 --> 01:06:16,280
that's great. Cool. That's all I really will ever say about it. I'm never going to be bigger than

369
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:34,179
the sun. I think I've tried over the years to, I don't know. I'm just trying to do as best I can.

370
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:54,780
That's it. It's all it ever was and all it probably ever will be. You're doing great,

371
01:06:54,780 --> 01:07:22,900
sweetie. Thank you. Oh, oh, oh, oh, am I big enough? Unfortunately, you peeked at coffee

372
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:35,530
Cheetos chicken. That's some truth to that, I think. Well, there are no more, let's see,

373
01:07:35,530 --> 01:07:54,360
there are no more planets. Let's see if I can get it. Did I get it? Oh, shit, I got it. Rolled up

374
01:07:54,360 --> 01:08:00,599
the sun. It's a huge deal, but there's something else that's kind of, you rolled the world into one,

375
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:05,699
you know, we don't really know whether that's a good thing or a bad thing. But

376
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:13,960
it's powerful global news. Earth must be going nuts now. Oh, you were rolling Earth.

377
01:08:14,519 --> 01:08:19,640
Wonder if our fans are all right. Ah, we feel something. We're feeling the presence of each

378
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:25,140
and every fan. Earth is fine. Don't worry, your highness. That's what they're saying. Oh,

379
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:31,640
what a relief. Come to think of it, this game mission was to roll a Katamari to, you know,

380
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:42,920
rant fans their wishes. There are still other fans on Earth. Maybe we didn't grant all their wishes

381
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:50,170
yet. But then again, rolling up the sun is such a happy thing. So we're going straight on to the

382
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:57,300
ending. The king decrees it. So now here's the profoundly moving ending coming up fast. Not the

383
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:07,819
end. I have to get ready. We'll just go on ahead. See you later. I know the curse is on the screen.

384
01:09:07,819 --> 01:10:00,890
I can't get it off. I can do better than that. Anybody here? Namco. Didn't the creator of

385
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:25,159
Katamari going to make a couple of the games? Oh, come here. I can't, I can't have people come

386
01:10:25,159 --> 01:11:05,750
with me. Oh, come on, cousin. Run. Run, cousin. Don't show the vampire anymore. I'm gonna get a

387
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:32,090
word in the letter. King of Ken. Wait, they're making another one? Are they actually making

388
01:11:32,090 --> 01:11:41,579
another Katamari? Oh, not, not Katamari. Okay. Turn the volume up, by the way. I'm turning the

389
01:11:41,579 --> 01:12:05,369
song up. Oh, I got grabbed. I told you to dodge. I didn't know how to dodge that quickly. You

390
01:12:05,369 --> 01:12:35,960
fucked it up. Okay. You can replay it. I'll replay it and I'll dodge. But there's more levels. We're

391
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:44,460
not done. There's at least four or five more levels to do. When are you gonna play Monster

392
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:59,159
Rancher DS? That sounds really fun. What class should I play in Diablo 4? The Sorceress.

393
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:25,180
The only one. Or uh, yeah, Necro. Druid all the way. I tried Druid. I tried Werewolf Druid

394
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:42,300
and I got to like level 20 something. I was just like, I hate this. And then I changed to

395
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:55,260
Sorceress. I was like, this is kind of fun. This game's kind of fun. Is it gonna be loud? I'm

396
01:13:55,260 --> 01:14:23,819
turning it down. Let's go. Oh, you were so close. Just a little more. Just a teeny bit. Just a

397
01:14:23,819 --> 01:14:37,100
squash. That's always the way it is. Just a little bit more. Cool. All right. So now what's this one?

398
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:46,220
Hello. It's been a while. It's we met in Katamari Damase. That was a great experience. Looks like

399
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:53,340
it also put the Hoshino family on the map. But wait, who cares? Earth is in danger. Your Highness

400
01:14:53,340 --> 01:15:10,859
is the only one who can save us all. Please, we need your help. Okay. Earth is blue. A very

401
01:15:10,859 --> 01:15:16,380
beautiful star, yes. Hope that it can hold a candle to the great cosmos. Oh, honey.

402
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:24,279
Hmm. Giant asteroid is headed towards Earth. Oh, sounds like fun. Please help us. We're all

403
01:15:24,279 --> 01:15:30,710
waiting for your Highness. All waiting? Oh, so you really were waiting. All righty. We'll totally

404
01:15:30,710 --> 01:15:44,100
save Earth. Danger. Earth is in danger. Trouble of the planet is in big trouble. If you don't hurry

405
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:49,449
up and roll a really big Katamari, Earth is going to have even more problems. This is going to

406
01:15:49,449 --> 01:16:05,699
smash into Earth. Sounds bad. Honey, you have to hurry or Earth is toast. Somebody help. Oh,

407
01:16:05,699 --> 01:16:14,810
you're picking up all the countries. Okay. Cool. Come on. How many countries are on Earth?

408
01:16:15,609 --> 01:16:30,310
Shit. I gotta get like all the islands. Oh my goodness. There goes all of... Okay, but that was

409
01:16:30,310 --> 01:17:19,720
all of Europe? Africa? It's almost here. Why is the Earth round? What's this one? Where's the...

410
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:32,890
I should have said, where's the United States? I know where it is. I just... I'm going to get...

411
01:17:33,609 --> 01:17:47,399
This is all of Africa. I have to get 100%. All right. Oh my god. It's right here.

412
01:17:48,840 --> 01:18:07,159
I got USA, Canada. Oh, I got Brazil. What's left? Am I not big enough to pick up? I can't pick up

413
01:18:07,159 --> 01:18:30,420
Russia. Get it. That's it. Wait, there's like one island. No. Oh, no. The Earth is gone. No more

414
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:39,029
Katamari to bossy, I guess. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. Control the Katamari

415
01:18:39,029 --> 01:18:44,069
properly. Next time will be different. We have a brand new Earth ready to go. We'll definitely

416
01:18:44,069 --> 01:19:01,109
save this one. Seriously. Okay, let's go. I cannot go fast. Retry. All the islands around me. Move

417
01:19:01,109 --> 01:19:09,880
your mouse, please. I'm telling you. I can't do it. I got to stay around here and get the islands.

418
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:30,409
It's a good start. Good start. That's a good start.

419
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:47,939
Come on. Can I get the United States yet? No. Sorry. South America.

420
01:19:48,579 --> 01:20:23,350
I can't get Brazil. I'll come back for it. Come on. Hurry up. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. What am I missing?

421
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:59,539
What am I missing? Okay. Good. The pace is fine. The pace is fine. The pace is perfectly fine.

422
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:10,550
I got Australia. I got China. This is Russia. All right. I got it. I got everything. Did I get

423
01:21:10,550 --> 01:21:26,710
everything? Did I get everything? Get the meteor? Holy shit. I didn't think I had to do that.

424
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:39,619
I thought I just did a save or everything. That's like two pixels away, isn't it?

425
01:21:41,319 --> 01:21:53,260
It's a little further than that. What should I make for my birthday dinner?

426
01:21:53,979 --> 01:21:56,460
Buffalo chicken. If you like it. If you can handle it.

427
01:21:58,739 --> 01:22:13,539
Buffalo chicken subs. 100%. Everyone on our earth is all right. We just confirmed it.

428
01:22:13,539 --> 01:22:26,649
It turned out well. Cool. Tell you the truth. I'd given up, but we all managed to survive.

429
01:22:26,649 --> 01:22:29,340
It's a token of our gratitude. We'd like your highness.

430
01:22:33,590 --> 01:22:38,140
Seriously. Fabulous. Thank you. We are so pleased. What should we do with it?

431
01:22:38,779 --> 01:22:58,010
Sorry. I'm just imagining it being... I'm just thinking if I was a teacher,

432
01:22:59,479 --> 01:23:03,960
it would be such a pain in the ass to get the class to just shut the fuck up and

433
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:10,619
pay attention again. Do you know what I'm saying? In the middle of teaching in a classroom being

434
01:23:10,619 --> 01:23:22,550
like, okay, kids. Be like, what was that? It was, I had a late lunch today. Be like,

435
01:23:22,550 --> 01:23:34,789
everybody stop talking now. Stop talking. That's enough. Streaming is so interesting because

436
01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:40,310
you may have just laughed out loud at me and I have no idea. I'm just still going. We're just

437
01:23:40,310 --> 01:24:00,460
going. That was kind of a small Katamari. Let's try it again. What did you say? Did you forget

438
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:09,579
that you have already told us? I already told you what? Imagine if you could hear all of us

439
01:24:09,579 --> 01:24:22,180
like a laugh track. That'd be so awful. That one time I went into discord and there was like

440
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:34,340
about 200 people in that call. Times that by 10. We are not that easy. All right, so we did this

441
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:46,090
one before but I think it has to be big, right? We're not big. This one has to be... We're sick

442
01:24:46,090 --> 01:24:51,050
and tired of just making it bigger. So we had a notion. We had a notion even though we're starving,

443
01:24:51,939 --> 01:24:59,159
just try rolling as quickly as possible and get it to about this big. You can do it. We know.

444
01:24:59,159 --> 01:25:04,819
All righty, good luck. All right, just get it to 50 and then submit it.

445
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:27,529
Do the teacher noise. I don't even think I could anymore. I have to be like really excitable to do

446
01:25:27,529 --> 01:26:16,729
it. I have to be super excited. Try it. I could probably do it. Shit. All right, good. I'll be

447
01:26:16,729 --> 01:26:49,800
happy if I can do this in two minutes. Damn it. This is it right here. Under two minutes. Come on.

448
01:26:53,369 --> 01:27:27,859
Get it. No, I'm not going to get it. Hurry. Okay, 220. That's not great. That's not bad.

449
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:40,500
I'll try to do it. Turn your volume down because it's probably going to be annoying.

450
01:27:40,500 --> 01:28:05,539
You guys ready? Ready? Definitely turn your volume down. 50 fucking years old. I still got it.

451
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:22,090
Hey, don't ever ask me for that ever again because I won't do it.

452
01:28:22,649 --> 01:28:46,170
Do you understand? Oh, shit. Sorry. I was looking at like off brands Twitter. It's like, oh, cool.

453
01:28:46,970 --> 01:28:57,210
What are people saying? Do a moment? No, that doesn't. We don't need a moment for that.

454
01:28:57,210 --> 01:29:18,630
Hey, you guys pumped for Final Fantasy 16 demo sponsor segment coming up very soon in the next

455
01:29:18,630 --> 01:29:34,359
probably couple hours. I want to do some of these because these are new.

456
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:50,539
Ballerina hunt study time. Is this seriously your last stream? No, I just told you we're playing

457
01:29:50,539 --> 01:30:04,470
zoom beanies in like two days. Extra special training. Night school. Lots of wheels. Let's do

458
01:30:04,470 --> 01:30:12,199
night school. Oh, that one is the last one. No, I just told you we're playing sorcery after that.

459
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:24,500
Like three days after that. And then that's the yeah. Okay, I see what's going on.

460
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:32,310
Hurry to the school and get them. All right, so I'm the king of the cosmos right now.

461
01:30:32,310 --> 01:30:49,619
Okay, don't be afraid of ghosts. Just hurry and get the forgotten instruments. Five in total.

462
01:30:50,180 --> 01:31:03,159
If you touch a ghost, you have to leave. What? I need to get the five instruments.

463
01:31:04,199 --> 01:31:22,649
Are they in this room? There's one here. Hey, quarter. Oh, shit.

464
01:31:28,279 --> 01:31:40,489
Can I leave? I can leave. Oh, my God. I'm just gonna hug the wall. All right, take an observation

465
01:31:40,489 --> 01:32:05,689
first. Where is it? Hey, there it is. How do I climb this? Okay, wait, can I even get that?

466
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:38,359
Do I have to get bigger? Oh, I'm done. Don't touch the ghost. I bounced.

467
01:32:43,180 --> 01:32:54,899
It'd be so funny if you played Five Nights at Freddy's. That would be actually pretty funny.

468
01:32:55,539 --> 01:33:09,350
Okay, what about lots of wheels? First, collect the tires. Run and run into the sunset. Become

469
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:23,060
a charming king. You get presents for these. Oh, cool. I'm into that. You got the Katabari

470
01:33:23,060 --> 01:33:38,970
faster than usual. Run, just run. Get lots of tires. Oh, you gotta be big enough to do that.

471
01:33:39,689 --> 01:34:28,920
Four minutes? I'm too small for that. Tires. I only have nine tires. I need to be big enough to

472
01:34:28,920 --> 01:35:03,380
pick up cars. I'm taking pick up cars. It's all over. All right, come on. Level up. All right,

473
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:32,680
I'm gonna be upgrading in a second here. Give me these. Oh, well, there's a whole tire factory

474
01:35:32,680 --> 01:36:01,350
over here. I need to be big enough to pick up the actual cars. There we go. Hurry up.

475
01:36:01,350 --> 01:36:14,970
Not big enough. Shit. All right, where? Somebody said I was missing tires. What about all this?

476
01:36:15,609 --> 01:37:08,329
What about these Minecraft houses up here? I got 200. There they are. 350? 20 seconds. I

477
01:37:08,329 --> 01:37:35,399
can pick up cars. No, I can't. Damn it. It's all right. Barely passing. The real test starts now.

478
01:37:37,050 --> 01:37:52,970
Shut up. God, did that happen? We think we were better than that. We aren't a prince.

479
01:37:54,500 --> 01:38:14,409
50%. That's it. That's a challenge mode. Okay, so I did this one. I did this one.

480
01:38:16,119 --> 01:38:24,569
Extra special training. Stop skipping salad. I don't think there is a salad in this one.

481
01:38:25,770 --> 01:38:30,810
I'm gonna do the 17 minutes to make a huge one again because I think I can do better than I did.

482
01:38:31,449 --> 01:38:45,659
Collect fighting spirit and seize victory. Become a brave king. Yeah, these are new. These

483
01:38:45,659 --> 01:38:57,859
missions are new as of the remaster. Shadow boxing boxer. Very sexy. If you get burning

484
01:38:57,859 --> 01:39:09,050
fighting spirit, your punches will get stronger. Roll until your ashes. What is that?

485
01:39:14,699 --> 01:39:19,420
Okay, I'm imagining... Does it get... Okay, the water does not affect it. You just have to get burnt?

486
01:39:19,420 --> 01:40:05,020
Street Fighter 6. I'm not picking anything up besides the fire. Is this a mistake?

487
01:40:11,260 --> 01:40:31,590
Oh, hold on. Look at this. There we go. This song's pretty good, huh? Yeah, I think I have

488
01:40:31,590 --> 01:41:02,619
this set to favorite songs. That's why it keeps playing. This is one of those songs.

489
01:41:03,260 --> 01:41:16,840
This is such a summertime. Windows down. Volume up. Cruisin' kind of song. Not too loud.

490
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:38,500
Not too loud. Loud enough to enjoy it, but not too loud to distract your driving. Not too loud.

491
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:52,500
Centrist Andy. Yeah, turn it up. Turn the volume up. Let's go pump it. No, but not too much volume.

492
01:41:52,500 --> 01:42:10,500
Maybe a little more than halfway is fine, though. Battle Damacy roll time. Oh, you got your salad.

493
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:33,960
Yeah, there it is. I have not completed one of these. These are tricky. Salad. I think both

494
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:37,640
quiet and loud volume have pros and cons to consider with that face of me moving around and

495
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:47,939
talking quickly. No, that is accurate. What you're saying is the truth. There is a time and a place

496
01:42:47,939 --> 01:42:57,510
for low music and loud music. I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I offend anybody here, but if I go out,

497
01:42:57,590 --> 01:43:02,869
I'm at an establishment, and I want to go out and have a couple drinks and talk. I want to be able

498
01:43:02,869 --> 01:43:10,489
to hear you talking. I'd like to hear you speaking. Here we go. Here he goes. Here he goes. Here he

499
01:43:10,489 --> 01:43:22,739
goes. I would like to hear you talk. A lot of establishments play very, very, very loud music

500
01:43:22,739 --> 01:43:34,550
to the point where you're talking over a vacuum cleaner for the entire night. I propose a separate

501
01:43:34,550 --> 01:43:43,859
room in every establishment that is closed off. That is the same building. It's just a place to go

502
01:43:43,859 --> 01:43:51,260
to get away from the loud music. This place can be decorated the same. It can be the same spot. It's

503
01:43:51,260 --> 01:44:08,439
just, hey, this is a room here that's a little bit quieter. You can have a conversation if you want.

504
01:44:08,439 --> 01:44:18,060
No, I'm not talking about a sensory room. What do you mean a sensory room? I didn't even pay

505
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:23,939
attention to what this was. What? No, I'm saying it's this.

506
01:44:30,569 --> 01:44:37,289
Wait, what? And then you turn your head, tilt, and aim your ear at their fucking mouth.

507
01:44:38,170 --> 01:44:47,560
Huh? I have to aim my ear directly at your mouth talking and lean in and lean in and put my hand up

508
01:44:47,560 --> 01:45:01,510
and tilt. I didn't pay attention again. Don't give up. Won't allow it.

509
01:45:01,510 --> 01:45:10,060
Roll Katamari until you collapse. Become the king of all cosmos.

510
01:45:10,060 --> 01:45:16,180
Anytime I'm in a place where there's a bunch of music playing, like a bar or it's just like,

511
01:45:16,180 --> 01:45:23,340
I want to hear you talk. Let's go out and have a few drinks and talk.

512
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:28,180
Let's do some interpersonal communication.

513
01:45:40,949 --> 01:45:46,170
I just asked if I wanted to get fucking pizza and then I said yes. And then everybody at the

514
01:45:46,170 --> 01:45:51,670
end of the night. Everybody at the end of the night sounds like this. Yeah, yeah, no, I'll call

515
01:45:51,670 --> 01:45:56,939
you to see what you're up to tomorrow. Yeah, give me a call when you have a chance. I'll probably

516
01:45:56,939 --> 01:46:21,000
get up at like 11 or something. I want interpersonal communication. Hey, look, I get it. Sometimes,

517
01:46:21,939 --> 01:46:26,659
sometimes you just want to just fucking rock out to some music and you don't want to talk to

518
01:46:26,659 --> 01:46:32,260
fucking anybody. I don't want to talk to some fucking asshole. I just want to rock out. Yeah,

519
01:46:32,260 --> 01:46:36,380
that's fine. Absolutely. Go for it.

520
01:46:40,869 --> 01:47:08,699
I was supposed to be picking up ballerinas and I have not found one. You know how places do like,

521
01:47:08,699 --> 01:47:16,760
oh, we're doing loud music Fridays. I would love for a bar or like a place to go like hang out

522
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:27,819
or anywhere. Never be like, hey, this is quieted down Fridays where we play the music 50% softer

523
01:47:29,850 --> 01:47:47,270
and quiet reading time. You guys don't want this? No, it's not a library. They would be playing

524
01:47:47,270 --> 01:47:54,579
music just loud enough where you can actually talk to people. Look, I like loud environments,

525
01:47:54,579 --> 01:47:59,779
too. It's not that I don't like a loud environment. It's just there's an environment where I want to

526
01:47:59,779 --> 01:48:06,180
talk to people. And when you stand around in a circle with four or five buds and you all have

527
01:48:06,260 --> 01:48:10,420
a cocktail in your hand and everyone just kind of looking at each other because I know I'm not

528
01:48:10,420 --> 01:48:17,619
going to be able to hear you. So I just kind of sip the drink and nod at you. Sip and nod at you

529
01:48:17,619 --> 01:48:37,510
and then walk the other direction. Do you start every conversation with I would like to start a

530
01:48:37,510 --> 01:48:53,130
dialogue? Bro, just go to the grocery store. No, but I'll tell you the grocery store is a good

531
01:48:53,130 --> 01:48:59,239
example of the kind of level of audio that I am looking for. That is the level of audio that I am

532
01:48:59,239 --> 01:49:04,170
looking for. And look, every now and again, you know, when they play, you know, when they play

533
01:49:04,170 --> 01:49:13,899
tequila, it's like, all right, turned up. I'm talking to you and we kind of have our drinks.

534
01:49:13,899 --> 01:49:19,500
Yeah. So I think about that business meeting. I'm going to be like, all right,

535
01:49:20,710 --> 01:49:23,909
we you understand what this is going to get loud. So we're going to rock out, right?

536
01:49:25,140 --> 01:49:32,779
I'm rocking out to tequila. And by rocking out to tequila, I mean putting the straw up,

537
01:49:32,779 --> 01:49:39,640
sipping, sipping the drink and just like moving my shoulders left and right. Yeah, tequila.

538
01:49:47,079 --> 01:49:52,279
And then someone does the Pee Wee Herman and everybody freaks the fuck out every time. You,

539
01:49:52,279 --> 01:50:00,039
I'm telling you right now, if you want to make sure that you are, you are awesome at one of these

540
01:50:00,039 --> 01:50:04,119
at a party or something. If tequila comes on and you do the Pee Wee Herman dance,

541
01:50:05,079 --> 01:50:20,470
you just made like 10 new friends. At least I'm not doing this right at all.

542
01:50:29,579 --> 01:50:38,579
Everybody knows that intro. What the hell is the Pee Wee Herman? It's the two fists closed,

543
01:50:40,060 --> 01:50:46,460
right foot out, sticking out, bent at the knee. And it's you go forward, tap, tap your fist

544
01:50:46,460 --> 01:50:53,659
closed together, hitting your thumbs together. And then you go back with the right foot behind

545
01:50:53,659 --> 01:50:58,619
the back with the fists. I would show you, but I don't have pants on. That person that said that

546
01:50:58,619 --> 01:51:07,060
was right. All right. I got to find ballerinas. Just, just go to YouTube and type in Pee Wee Herman

547
01:51:07,060 --> 01:51:29,369
dance. That's you'll find it. How big are these ballerinas? This is kind of like people like this

548
01:51:29,369 --> 01:51:35,770
or are they smaller or bigger? I, how do I, what am I looking for? Exactly. I know what top left,

549
01:51:35,770 --> 01:51:57,979
but I accidentally picked one up early. I don't know. Let's focus on getting bigger first.

550
01:51:58,779 --> 01:52:16,460
This game is fucking fun. But here's the problem though. Make sure you're the first one to do the

551
01:52:16,460 --> 01:52:22,470
Pee Wee Herman because someone's going to upstage you. You'll know because the second that that song

552
01:52:22,470 --> 01:52:26,550
comes on, someone's going to put the drink down. They're going to be like, oh fuck, this is time.

553
01:52:26,550 --> 01:52:32,789
Like, can you hold this for a sec? Like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you don't. No, no,

554
01:52:32,789 --> 01:52:36,600
I'm not going to hold your drink. And then you go, Hey, hold my drink for somebody else.

555
01:52:37,159 --> 01:52:43,159
You got to make sure you do it first. Cause if you're the second person to do the Pee Wee Herman

556
01:52:43,159 --> 01:53:00,260
tequila dance. Ooh, come on. You know, Joe already did that. You got to make sure you're the first

557
01:53:00,260 --> 01:53:15,350
one. Who's Joe? I don't know. Go put some fucking pants on and show us. You already know what it is.

558
01:53:15,350 --> 01:53:21,109
You just want me to embarrass myself on his webcam, which I get it. I can understand you.

559
01:53:21,109 --> 01:53:27,909
I understand where you're coming from. No, no, dude. I don't get it. How does it work?

560
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:49,220
Look at this fucking idiot. Okay. I think I'm big enough. This game just became a hidden object

561
01:53:49,220 --> 01:54:04,899
game and I'm not very good at it. Have you guys seen any so far? How would you do this in under

562
01:54:04,899 --> 01:54:33,220
two minutes? Oh, right there. This one's weird. What the hell? I'm not big enough.

563
01:54:46,279 --> 01:55:10,340
Still too small? How am I still too small? I see it. I just can't, I cannot pick up the ballerina

564
01:55:10,340 --> 01:55:33,899
to get a little bigger. These fishes were just dancing. I just saw the Pee Wee dance. It looks

565
01:55:33,899 --> 01:55:59,369
like cringe. What do we do with them? You know what I mean? Like what? In mod chat, Pee Wee dance is

566
01:55:59,369 --> 01:56:12,569
just the first Fortnite dance. It actually is. That's true. Prove them wrong then. Prove them

567
01:56:12,569 --> 01:56:22,569
wrong. All right. This is only for you. This is only for your guys ears only. The next time that

568
01:56:22,569 --> 01:56:32,170
I show up on camera, I will do the Pee Wee Herman dance to any music that pops up. And I'm talking

569
01:56:32,170 --> 01:56:37,529
about, I could be with a bunch of other people. Like I'm doing the Pee Wee dance and the next

570
01:56:37,529 --> 01:56:45,689
time that I'm on stream, this one or whatever one, if music starts playing and it's danceable music,

571
01:56:45,689 --> 01:56:54,539
I will do the Pee Wee Herman and see what happens. Okay. Now I can definitely pick people up.

572
01:56:54,539 --> 01:57:24,890
Okay. There we go. There's two. Probably out of this area. Do you see any? There's one. All right.

573
01:57:24,890 --> 01:57:39,369
One more. Way too much time on this, by the way. Way too much time. I would avoid the person doing

574
01:57:39,369 --> 01:57:48,090
the Pee Wee dance. That's all right. It's all right. Me and the buds will be having a grand

575
01:57:48,090 --> 01:58:29,140
old time. We'll be having a good old time. Where? Where? By where you started? We're going to hold

576
01:58:29,140 --> 01:59:10,329
you to that. That's fine. No, that's fine. Please hold me to it. Over here? Oh, right here. All

577
01:59:10,329 --> 01:59:31,609
right. Well, that was so long, but I did it. Okay. As long as me and the buds are having fun.

578
01:59:32,409 --> 01:59:55,079
Take eight minutes, five minutes. You do you. Okay. So this last one is this one study time.

579
02:00:00,699 --> 02:00:06,140
Can we please restart the debt arc? The debt arc never came to a conclusion.

580
02:00:08,779 --> 02:00:16,300
You want some insider info of the debt arc? I tried to close that joke a half a dozen times,

581
02:00:16,300 --> 02:00:23,510
at least. And I kept failing the bets and kept making the price higher. Trust me, I tried. It's

582
02:00:23,510 --> 02:00:27,750
like, oh, okay. Oh, a billion off the debt. If I do this and I just wouldn't do it, I would fuck up

583
02:00:27,750 --> 02:00:33,750
every time. It would never happen. I was always increasing it. Even when I thought I was decreasing

584
02:00:33,750 --> 02:00:47,960
with something I knew I could do and did now solve the solve it. I'm so glad you stopped talking

585
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:54,840
about it. Well, it just got to a point where I kept screwing up, clean up quick. And oh,

586
02:00:54,840 --> 02:01:20,979
I only have a minute. Minute? How am I going to do this in a minute? Actually, it's not that much.

587
02:01:32,279 --> 02:01:59,829
I did it, right? Yeah, I got enough. Barely passing. It's still passing.

588
02:02:13,220 --> 02:02:26,470
Please can I, um, whatever you guys, you guys are on today. You guys are on point today. Cool.

589
02:02:27,350 --> 02:02:40,649
All right. I want to go do, I want to go do this. Did all these. That was pretty fun. I want to do

590
02:02:40,649 --> 02:02:53,289
some more of these. Where's the big one? The elephant, right? I have to get that one much

591
02:02:53,289 --> 02:03:06,600
better. Oh, something new over here. What's new? Is it you? Cousins, second cousins. I want to play

592
02:03:06,600 --> 02:03:25,930
with them all. Hurry and roll them all up. What do you mean? Get a bunch of cousins? All right.

593
02:03:25,930 --> 02:03:44,090
Here we are. No, I need them all. Oh, I need them all. Okay. Uh, was it the elephant?

594
02:03:44,810 --> 02:04:07,750
Where's the elephant? I'm going to use this character. I like that. Where's the elephant?

595
02:04:08,470 --> 02:04:21,750
What's the Katamari Memorial? Oh, okay. Hey dude, can you do a stream where you fulfill all the

596
02:04:21,750 --> 02:04:27,819
promises you made in rapid succession? Now that's a really, really, really good idea.

597
02:04:29,380 --> 02:04:34,659
We have a list of these. Okay. Who's been, somebody's been keeping track of this somehow.

598
02:04:34,659 --> 02:04:45,500
Okay. Let's go over these. Um, second Catboy stream, Paper Mario, D&D with stir, Mega Milk

599
02:04:45,500 --> 02:04:52,600
shirt stream, playing neon white sorcery, the monster breeder browser game, iPad stream night,

600
02:04:52,600 --> 02:04:57,899
M. Dickey stream night, Bionicle building stream, pre-recorded stream, children's entertainment

601
02:04:57,899 --> 02:05:06,220
stream, remake autos big adventure, yoga stream. Interesting. Hilux two, ace attorney, Tony Hawk's

602
02:05:06,220 --> 02:05:14,310
underground two, BLT sandwich stream. I thought that said during surgery. It says during sorcery.

603
02:05:14,310 --> 02:05:22,819
Bugleberry audio book, man versus machine, zoom beanies, Peggle, Pee Wee Herman dance,

604
02:05:22,819 --> 02:05:36,380
next face cam stream. Not that many. You want me to do each one of those in five minutes?

605
02:05:36,380 --> 02:05:55,449
I'd get, I would get sick. Battleaxe? Yeah. Don't worry. Hey, hey, off-brand. Hey, chief

606
02:05:55,449 --> 02:06:00,470
officer of off-brand. You don't think, you don't think a battleaxe will show up at some point?

607
02:06:00,470 --> 02:06:18,390
Come on. Where's the elephant? How come the elephant's not here? You passed it already?

608
02:06:18,390 --> 02:06:34,920
How did I not see an elephant? How do you miss an elephant? It's called the screen is showing

609
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:40,979
lights and colors at me, but information is not being processed. I am just up here in my head.

610
02:06:41,699 --> 02:06:46,579
Nothing else is going on there. The screen is just colors and lights. There's nothing on it.

611
02:06:47,930 --> 02:06:52,890
When I start talking and we just haven't just looking at chat and stuff. All right. Let me

612
02:06:52,890 --> 02:07:13,930
try to make this one big. I want to get this one done right. I'll do it right. There's no way you're

613
02:07:14,010 --> 02:07:33,510
dodging a battleaxe. You can think that's fine. A thousand meters. Oh shit. Okay.

614
02:07:48,970 --> 02:08:06,090
Play last of us. Oh, I feel like I've missed. I missed that big time. Why are you just skipping

615
02:08:06,090 --> 02:08:33,909
over the laugh? What laugh? What laugh? The mouse have to scream. There we go.

616
02:08:33,909 --> 02:08:45,689
Oh, we can talk. It's still just three meters. You're going for a thousand. Well,

617
02:08:45,689 --> 02:08:50,010
with such a long way to go, how about having some fun with the rolling? Like roll backwards

618
02:08:50,010 --> 02:08:54,489
the rest of the way, but trying a roller too with your eyes closed. Of course there's no

619
02:08:54,489 --> 02:09:08,300
benefit whatsoever, but it could be kind of fun. Maybe. Get over here now. I never played stray.

620
02:09:08,300 --> 02:09:35,020
I know I didn't. I'm not ready to go that way yet. You unironically promised paper Mario

621
02:09:35,020 --> 02:10:20,279
thousand year door back in 2017. Okay. Well, I'm going this way. You also said you're going to

622
02:10:20,279 --> 02:10:25,399
play arc two when it came out. No, I did not. You, that's reaching. You are reaching really

623
02:10:25,399 --> 02:10:30,779
far into the memory bank here. No, I never said that. When did I say I was going to play arc two?

624
02:10:38,680 --> 02:10:42,520
Get the clip. Get the clip. There is no clip of me saying, yeah, man, I'm really excited to play

625
02:10:42,520 --> 02:10:49,159
arc two. I don't, I don't think that's ever came out. That sentence has never been formed out of

626
02:10:49,159 --> 02:11:13,560
my mouth. I definitely didn't say it. Careful. You never played the Barbie horse adventure game

627
02:11:13,560 --> 02:11:22,439
either. Yeah, but you got to give me a little, give me a little bit of slack here. Here's how

628
02:11:22,439 --> 02:11:38,329
many video games exist ever? There's a lot. There's a lot of them. Are there more than 500,000 video

629
02:11:38,329 --> 02:11:46,600
games that have released? I made just about a thousand YouTube videos before I started really

630
02:11:46,600 --> 02:11:57,260
streaming on Twitch and I've streamed like what, like two or three thousand times. Like at least

631
02:11:57,260 --> 02:12:03,819
a couple of thousand times. That means I've only played like 3% of 5% of every, every video game

632
02:12:03,819 --> 02:12:27,670
that exists. What is this shit? He's laughing already. What's even funny? I really am Beavis

633
02:12:27,670 --> 02:12:36,600
and Butthead combined as one person. What are you talking about? Two Vin Diesel is the character.

634
02:12:36,600 --> 02:12:42,699
I don't understand what we're watching here. That was a fan fiction. Like they made that.

635
02:12:45,420 --> 02:12:51,479
Somebody made that in Blender. What? I didn't say I was going to play it.

636
02:12:53,140 --> 02:12:56,979
I have to play that day one. Well, you're an idiot for saying that.

637
02:13:06,699 --> 02:13:14,710
People pulling out these receipts. So Grump Clump, you said you were going to play Billy Hatcher and

638
02:13:14,710 --> 02:13:24,539
the Giant Egg. It looks fun. I'll add it to the list when slash if a GameCube night comes back.

639
02:13:24,539 --> 02:13:41,430
This is a year ago. You should do an ice cream making stream. That sounds actually really cool.

640
02:13:41,430 --> 02:13:55,960
I like that idea. Thank you. I got it. Don't happen again. I'll try. Jesus. Settle the fuck down.

641
02:14:10,250 --> 02:14:16,500
I could read you guys the list of games that I have and it dates years back and some of

642
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:23,130
the stuff I just have never opened. That sounds fun. Put it on this list and then I never open it.

643
02:14:28,340 --> 02:14:34,819
One day we'll also have to go over the retirement retirement. I definitely want to go over with you

644
02:14:34,819 --> 02:14:41,899
guys all the ideas that I wish I could have done. I just didn't and we'll just kind of go over them

645
02:14:41,899 --> 02:14:47,260
and rank them on a tier list of what you guys think would have been the best one and I'll do

646
02:14:47,260 --> 02:14:55,350
that one. Do you know what I mean? We'll go over the, I'll open my fucking notebook. We could go

647
02:14:55,350 --> 02:15:01,989
over like the 30 different stream ideas that I've wanted to do and we'll rank them and then I'll do

648
02:15:01,989 --> 02:15:23,220
it. I'll do the one that's the highest rank. You're streaming until you drop dead. Okay.

649
02:15:27,560 --> 02:15:47,699
You fucking maniac. You're streaming until you drop dead. No, I have an idea. I know what I'm

650
02:15:47,699 --> 02:15:54,340
doing for the retirement stream. Oh, I know. It's been, I've had it ready. It's been up here. I know

651
02:15:54,340 --> 02:16:12,010
exactly what it is. It's going to be humorous. It makes me laugh. It makes me laugh every time

652
02:16:13,239 --> 02:16:19,220
because I don't know. It's kind of, it's kind of like fucked up, but whatever. Not really,

653
02:16:19,220 --> 02:16:32,700
but it is. It's just, I think it makes me laugh. So I don't care. I want to tell you one of the

654
02:16:32,700 --> 02:16:37,180
jokes so bad, but if I do actually go through with this and it'll be worth it. You just not

655
02:16:37,180 --> 02:16:47,110
and just waiting till whenever that happens. It's kind of fun to just relaxingly play this game.

656
02:16:47,110 --> 02:16:56,739
Just like roll over stuff and get bigger. This is fun. I like this one. Yeah. No, I'll show the

657
02:16:56,739 --> 02:17:05,819
Aaron fart video before I retire. I promise. I'll release all of my draft tweets. No, I will

658
02:17:14,059 --> 02:17:16,139
stop making promises. You're not going to keep any of these.

659
02:17:34,899 --> 02:17:42,299
We talk about candy or something instead. No, don't worry. Don't worry.

660
02:17:52,340 --> 02:17:54,899
You're going to dig in your grave here by making all these promises.

661
02:18:09,340 --> 02:18:17,030
How's your talkie addiction going? Oh, actually. So here's a funny little story.

662
02:18:18,149 --> 02:18:28,950
I started drinking beet juice and I like, I don't want to say like 12 hours later.

663
02:18:30,540 --> 02:18:41,659
Beet juice. E as in Barry. E as in Barry. E-A-T. Beet. No, B-E-E-T. E. How many E's?

664
02:18:42,700 --> 02:18:45,899
Chief creative officer of off-brand. How are you? Good. Nice to meet you.

665
02:18:45,899 --> 02:18:56,629
Take my hand. There you are. Yeah. How do you spell beets? I don't know. B-E-E-T.

666
02:18:57,510 --> 02:19:12,409
B-E-E-T juice. Not meat as in M as in Mary. OK, the whole punchline with this is I peed

667
02:19:13,049 --> 02:19:18,819
bright red and I thought I pissed blood and I freaked out and I thought it was the talkies

668
02:19:18,819 --> 02:19:24,500
that I ate. I was like, no, can't we ask me the talkies? Talkies are red. But no,

669
02:19:26,420 --> 02:19:34,180
I did not know this. Apparently some people, like 20% of the population, if you drink beet juice,

670
02:19:34,260 --> 02:19:49,180
or if you eat B-E-E-T-S, you pee red. No, you don't. If you drink beet juice, your pee is red.

671
02:19:58,940 --> 02:20:11,370
Weird. Somebody lied to you? No, they did not. Because every time I've drank beet juice,

672
02:20:12,170 --> 02:20:16,649
a day later, I have a full red piss. Like, well, that's a lie. It's like pink.

673
02:20:18,040 --> 02:20:20,520
I'm embellishing because I'm a fucking live streamer and that's all we do.

674
02:20:21,559 --> 02:20:44,059
You are fucked up. I'm really not. I think I just eat some beets and then tell me how you feel.

675
02:20:44,860 --> 02:20:48,979
Probably will feel pretty good because they're really good for you. It kind of tastes like

676
02:20:48,979 --> 02:21:17,319
dirt though. I think I can get a lot of these buildings here now because it tastes like goat

677
02:21:17,319 --> 02:21:23,659
cheese. It's in that same world of goat cheese flavor, where it has that kind of very soil-y

678
02:21:24,379 --> 02:21:40,659
dirt. It's kind of like dirt. Name five historical landmarks on this map.

679
02:21:42,870 --> 02:22:04,329
Taj Mahal, Great Wall of China, Statue of Liberty, Eiffel Tower, and the Leaning Tower of

680
02:22:04,969 --> 02:22:54,139
Pisa. And then, Big London. Oh, I love this no time limit routine. That's great.

681
02:22:55,020 --> 02:23:20,010
Big London is the name of the bell. Cool. Have you ever really gotten mad at chat before?

682
02:23:20,889 --> 02:23:30,180
Oh, yes. Yes, it has happened. I have been screaming for like seven years.

683
02:23:30,979 --> 02:23:35,860
Yes, there's been at least one or two times where I've been like, what the fuck are they saying?

684
02:23:36,819 --> 02:24:10,069
Do they know? It's had to have happened at least once. Getting there. When we're full of

685
02:24:10,069 --> 02:24:31,879
contrarian Andes, he gets sassy. Can I get? Nope, not yet. You spent two minutes mocking

686
02:24:31,879 --> 02:24:35,959
me one time because I said that one of the nerds in Sam and Max sounded like you.

687
02:24:40,139 --> 02:24:50,069
Um, okay. But we're, this is a two-way street. It's not like, oh yeah, remember that time that

688
02:24:50,069 --> 02:24:56,469
Jerma got, yeah, yeah, Jerma gets mad at chat all the time. Remember the time that we raided him

689
02:24:57,350 --> 02:25:02,409
until he fucking got angry at us? You're leaving out a very important part.

690
02:25:03,450 --> 02:25:10,840
Yeah, I remember that time that Jerma got really upset. Yeah, it was weird. I just said his hair

691
02:25:10,840 --> 02:25:17,799
looked like shit and he smelled like yellow M&Ms. And that I think that he, his eyes,

692
02:25:18,760 --> 02:25:23,319
his eyes are too close together. That's all I, I don't, why did he get mad at us?

693
02:25:23,319 --> 02:25:27,079
Why did he say? I don't understand. Why was he so upset with us today?

694
02:25:28,280 --> 02:25:49,190
What's the maddest you've ever been on stream? I don't know. I'm trying to think of some real

695
02:25:49,190 --> 02:25:59,260
genuine moments where I was actually really, really unhappy. They're very far, few and far between

696
02:26:00,139 --> 02:26:06,459
because I mean, all right, no more jokes. Let's be real. I treat this stream. I mean, like the

697
02:26:06,459 --> 02:26:11,579
whole point of this stream is kind of just fucking around. I just like having fun. It's

698
02:26:11,579 --> 02:26:20,200
fun to mess around with a bunch of people. It's fun. I don't take what I'm doing here.

699
02:26:21,879 --> 02:26:26,950
Well, I do take it serious. I take fucking around really seriously. Does that make sense?

700
02:26:29,540 --> 02:26:39,579
I take messing around really seriously. But besides that, I just treat this as like a

701
02:26:39,579 --> 02:26:45,879
fun space where I'm not really, I know that we're all kind of messing around for the most part.

702
02:26:45,879 --> 02:26:52,809
So yeah, sometimes somebody comes in and just like, oh, this guy's a dickhead. And it's like,

703
02:26:52,809 --> 02:27:04,299
okay, whatever. But like 99.9% of the time, it's just like, it doesn't bother me. And I know people

704
02:27:04,299 --> 02:27:29,899
just have fun. I'm going to assume this person's accusing me of being bald. Let's see. What did

705
02:27:29,899 --> 02:27:40,139
you say? Be honest. Is this the reason why you haven't had a face cam on? Oh, wait, what? Oh,

706
02:27:40,139 --> 02:27:43,100
I thought you were going to say, be honest. Do you have not have a face cam on because you're bald,

707
02:27:43,100 --> 02:28:05,690
that you don't want to show anybody? No. But the answer to that. Self-reporting? Yeah. It's

708
02:28:05,690 --> 02:28:16,809
going to happen. I wonder, when I do start to really show, when I start to show that I'm going

709
02:28:16,809 --> 02:28:21,540
bald, which I don't think I'm going to, I don't think it's really going to happen, but what do

710
02:28:21,620 --> 02:28:30,100
you think is going to be more important to the community? Bald guy or short guy? That's a

711
02:28:30,100 --> 02:28:38,840
conundrum. I wonder, I wonder how, how you guys are going to take it. Will it always be like,

712
02:28:38,840 --> 02:28:43,319
oh, he's like kind of short or will it be bald bald? He's bald guy. Bald would be fresh.

713
02:28:44,680 --> 02:28:50,700
Why can't you be bald and short? Maybe you're going to, you know, you're going to pick one.

714
02:28:50,700 --> 02:29:04,260
I know you. I know you. When I turn the webcam on and I'm bald for the first time or like balding,

715
02:29:04,260 --> 02:29:09,700
you're just going to write bald. You're not going to write short and bald. No, no, no,

716
02:29:09,700 --> 02:29:20,680
that's far too much. You're just going to write bald. That's it. I'm going to make it really hard

717
02:29:20,680 --> 02:29:25,620
for you. I'm going to, I'm going to stand next to like a measurement tool that says like five,

718
02:29:25,620 --> 02:29:52,059
five on it, but I'm going to be balding for real. Thank you, George. Yeah. I don't even care.

719
02:29:55,799 --> 02:30:13,370
I don't even care. Said by the person that very much does. He's crying. I don't actually care.

720
02:30:14,010 --> 02:30:21,850
I'm very confident. I'm very confident in who I am. I'm, I'm who I am. I don't care.

721
02:30:23,860 --> 02:30:30,260
I'm super quick. I'm very, very, I can have explosive energy. I can fit in a lot of really,

722
02:30:30,819 --> 02:30:34,819
I can fit in a lot of spaces that normally, you know, a lot of big tall people can't fit in.

723
02:30:34,819 --> 02:31:24,579
I don't give a shit. And nevermind. And what? And what? There is no and 20 minutes. Well,

724
02:31:24,579 --> 02:31:35,420
this isn't relaxing. Hey, what's the point of this game is to be, nope. Oh, brand awareness.

725
02:31:37,940 --> 02:31:58,459
No, we're going to have a lot of fun. I can't wait till the first company meeting where me

726
02:31:58,459 --> 02:32:22,100
and stands have a friend ending argument. And he throws a coffee in my face. No,

727
02:32:23,139 --> 02:32:29,670
we've already talked a bunch of times and I think we're all kind of laser focused on trying to be

728
02:32:30,549 --> 02:32:39,129
trying to make us go to stuff as we can and have fun doing it. The group is very much

729
02:32:40,010 --> 02:32:59,959
on the same page completely. Yep. I know I don't want to keep, you know, I mean, obviously I do

730
02:32:59,959 --> 02:33:05,739
want to keep reiterating it, but for people that weren't here at the beginning, uh, yeah, I've,

731
02:33:05,739 --> 02:33:13,110
I am now officially an employee of off brand as the chief creative officer of the company.

732
02:33:13,110 --> 02:33:38,260
Can I keep going? Oh, I didn't get to roll up everything. Finally got a job. That's right.

733
02:33:41,829 --> 02:33:54,020
I'm looking forward to it. Yep. Again, I'll make it clear. The role that I'm going to have in off

734
02:33:54,020 --> 02:33:59,299
brand is to be essentially creative director of most of the stuff that comes through.

735
02:34:00,260 --> 02:34:05,610
So if you have a show and you want to do it through off brand, we're probably going to talk

736
02:34:06,649 --> 02:34:16,649
extensively to develop out some of those things. So essentially it's like a, it's like a creative

737
02:34:16,649 --> 02:34:48,040
director of the company. That was fun. Are you going to give ideas or just help other ideas

738
02:34:48,040 --> 02:34:54,469
happen? I think it's kind of going to be everything. A little bit of everything.

739
02:34:56,579 --> 02:35:00,659
If I have something that I think I could add or that I want to do that I think would be great,

740
02:35:00,659 --> 02:35:07,799
maybe there's people that would want to do it. Help develop somebody else's idea.

741
02:35:08,520 --> 02:35:17,100
That sounds really fun to me. That's nice. I would do that to write up my alley land of mystery,

742
02:35:17,100 --> 02:35:32,680
small bang. And also working very closely with the production team. I, my responsibilities will

743
02:35:32,680 --> 02:35:40,379
probably develop a lot over the coming period, but I'm imagining it'll probably play out something

744
02:35:40,379 --> 02:35:49,500
like how I do it for my own shows. I write a bunch of stuff. I say, Hey, I want it like this.

745
02:35:49,500 --> 02:35:52,540
I want it to be like that and like that. And it should be like this. And here's like the whole

746
02:35:52,540 --> 02:35:58,760
document of how I want it to go. And we take that to production. We see how it can fit in,

747
02:35:58,760 --> 02:36:05,819
go back and forth a lot. It's essentially just sort of the, the, a lot of writing, a lot of

748
02:36:05,819 --> 02:36:14,629
a kind of onsite direction, I think too, which is what I like to do. That's where I hope to be.

749
02:36:14,709 --> 02:36:21,940
Are you just an ideas guy? No, no, I'm going to be like on site for a lot of these shows.

750
02:36:23,290 --> 02:36:29,049
And I'll be writing probably a very large portion of a lot of stuff that we're working on, I imagine.

751
02:36:30,520 --> 02:36:35,659
So no, but it's, it is that too. It's kind of everything that you're describing that I'm

752
02:36:35,659 --> 02:36:48,360
describing. Oh, he's a writer now. You can have it. I can't ever tell anybody I'm a writer.

753
02:36:48,360 --> 02:37:04,309
I just can't. I'm because I'm not. Did I beat everything? I think we're done. He's going to be

754
02:37:04,309 --> 02:37:09,159
an on the scene e-clown. I'm going to walk over there and be like, wait, wait, wait, wait,

755
02:37:09,159 --> 02:37:15,260
wait, hold on a second. That was, you need to say it with a little more oomph, a little more oomph.

756
02:37:15,260 --> 02:37:22,500
You need to squeeze your nose afterwards. Like there's no, we don't have a clown nose in this

757
02:37:22,500 --> 02:37:37,139
scene. Why not? How could there not be a clown noise in every scene? Do you worry that you'll

758
02:37:37,139 --> 02:37:42,100
be so busy with projects that you'll run out of creative steam and won't be able to work on your

759
02:37:42,100 --> 02:37:48,500
own stuff? No, I don't think so. Because my own stuff at this point is going to probably be,

760
02:37:49,139 --> 02:38:09,379
is off-brand. That's a lot of the point, I think. You're only 45% finished. What do you got? What's

761
02:38:09,379 --> 02:38:32,700
this one again? They all have alternate versions, right? So it's also, so it's just a change in

762
02:38:32,700 --> 02:38:39,530
focus in terms of where stuff like baseball stream will be coming from. I think it's both focus and

763
02:38:40,729 --> 02:38:47,879
sort of the evolution of where I really wanted to be. This is something I've always wanted to do.

764
02:38:48,520 --> 02:38:59,540
And I can continue to stream and still do this stuff. Working on a show and working on a project

765
02:38:59,540 --> 02:39:04,100
or something and doing all these things with off-brand is, it's going to take up a significant

766
02:39:04,100 --> 02:39:12,819
amount of time, but not all of my time. So I still can do this too, sort of in an evolved way where

767
02:39:12,819 --> 02:39:19,979
I'm putting time here and putting time over there, putting time here. Because I genuinely love doing

768
02:39:19,979 --> 02:39:31,430
this. I love to stream. It's fun. It's a lot of fun. In the mod chat there's a comment that says

769
02:39:31,430 --> 02:39:36,229
I need to respond to this. Okay. Jerma, will you ever have to for when you are going to in the

770
02:39:36,229 --> 02:39:44,950
future, will you be able to wanting to have that or no? I don't think so. I think what matters is

771
02:39:44,950 --> 02:39:52,040
how I feel about what you're describing. And I think how I feel about it is I feel like this is

772
02:39:52,040 --> 02:39:59,659
just the natural way that I would have done it anyways. What a really good question. What a really

773
02:39:59,659 --> 02:40:17,430
good comment. Use your left and right. Wait, this is the tutorial. Wait, how come I'm doing

774
02:40:17,430 --> 02:40:37,750
the tutorial again? Is there a reason why I'm here? That guy was the tutorial. I thought he

775
02:40:37,750 --> 02:40:56,969
had a different mission for me. Jeez. Oh, I want to do another car one. That sounds fun.

776
02:41:06,229 --> 02:41:23,420
I played this yesterday. It's a good game. You can fly now beyond. What? You want to roll up cars?

777
02:41:24,379 --> 02:41:32,329
I've also talked to other streamers and YouTubers over the past year or two and just been like,

778
02:41:32,409 --> 02:41:43,049
you know, we should work together. We should do some stuff together. And now this is my job now

779
02:41:43,049 --> 02:41:49,860
is to do that. So I'm really hopeful and excited that anybody that I've really talked to over the

780
02:41:49,860 --> 02:41:56,100
years of like, hey, we should do something like, oh, yeah, we should. Okay. Well, let's do it.

781
02:41:56,100 --> 02:42:15,700
Let's do something because it's really easy to get into that mindset where, oh, yeah, we'll do

782
02:42:15,700 --> 02:42:21,299
something. Yeah. Oh, yeah. And it's like, I'm like, I got my own shit going on. And I something else

783
02:42:21,299 --> 02:42:26,540
happened. And yeah, maybe some baby. Well, maybe one day. Yeah. No, well, let's just do it. Let's

784
02:42:26,540 --> 02:42:38,100
do it. My job here going forward is to make sure I follow up on those things. Because that's the

785
02:42:38,100 --> 02:42:56,760
point now. But yeah, I want all those. Oh, this one. Oh, that's right. This one has all forward

786
02:42:56,760 --> 02:43:34,579
momentum. I can't stop. What does that sound? I want there is your favorite cousin.

787
02:43:38,860 --> 02:44:02,979
The ball tennis ball. I think I did pretty good there. Two minutes and 16 seconds.

788
02:44:02,979 --> 02:44:16,059
Yeah. That's pretty cool. Oh, shit. That's right. So we're talking about are you still eating

789
02:44:16,059 --> 02:44:23,079
Takis? I thought the Takis is what made me read. And I looked it up. It was the beats all along.

790
02:44:23,959 --> 02:44:37,829
Oh, they actually like it this time. You like it. Oh, got a good score.

791
02:45:01,209 --> 02:45:10,379
No more salad. When are we doing the final fantasy 16 stuff? Um, just whenever. Whenever I feel like

792
02:45:10,379 --> 02:45:17,780
switching over to it. So it's just the demo. I think we're also going to watch one of the

793
02:45:17,780 --> 02:45:28,840
trailers for the game, too. But I am actually I'm very curious if I like this or not, because

794
02:45:28,840 --> 02:45:32,840
Final Fantasy is I never really got into very much Final Fantasy, by the way, Chrono Trigger

795
02:45:32,840 --> 02:45:36,840
and Chrono Cross, the most important media in human history. It's up there.

796
02:45:38,200 --> 02:45:44,020
But Final Fantasy has been something I haven't really paid that much attention to for,

797
02:45:44,020 --> 02:45:48,819
I want to say, since like, I don't think I see 10 on a fantasy six or something.

798
02:45:49,540 --> 02:46:05,770
Well, I'm going to do one more level and we'll switch over. Chrono Cross is mediocre.

799
02:46:05,770 --> 02:46:18,059
I agree. I agree. But I will tell you Chrono Cross is soundtrack carries that entire game.

800
02:46:18,059 --> 02:46:32,709
The Chrono Cross soundtrack is is so good that I can handle the kind of kind of wild kind of

801
02:46:32,709 --> 02:46:36,870
convoluted storyline. And don't put spoilers, please, because a lot of people don't know what

802
02:46:36,870 --> 02:46:43,049
I'm talking about. But if you know, you know, it's kind of messy. You needed to experience

803
02:46:43,049 --> 02:46:49,129
a text based adventure game before playing Chrono Cross to get the actual story of how the game

804
02:46:49,690 --> 02:47:06,600
worked. So talk to that dog. I did before, didn't I? Another nice day. Didn't I already do the sun?

805
02:47:11,379 --> 02:47:15,620
But Chrono Cross's soundtrack carries the whole game, except for the battle music,

806
02:47:15,620 --> 02:47:24,819
which is unfortunate because you hear the battle music more than anything else.

807
02:47:24,819 --> 02:47:28,819
You really rolled it up. You rolled up the sun really and truly. Oh, we are impressed.

808
02:47:29,620 --> 02:47:39,219
We have a dog among our fans. One more time. One more time? I can't say no. Do it till the end.

809
02:47:39,219 --> 02:47:52,790
Do only this. The battle music is OK. It has no lasting power at all.

810
02:47:53,510 --> 02:48:05,989
I think it's just kind of the tempo is sort of out of whack with the game. It's just like that.

811
02:48:09,989 --> 02:48:12,790
Oh, my God. I just get the shit out of myself without somebody in my room.

812
02:48:17,879 --> 02:48:22,809
I was hitting my desk and something fell off the desk to the left and fell down.

813
02:48:23,370 --> 02:48:26,969
And I was like, oh, shit, there's something in here. I thought there was an animal in my room.

814
02:48:32,260 --> 02:48:42,620
Sorry. That fucking sound from Devil May Cry, I swear, has permanently fucked me up.

815
02:48:42,620 --> 02:49:10,600
Prey instincts. Corn nuts. Yeah. But what I was trying to say is

816
02:49:15,500 --> 02:49:19,500
this is too fast for battle music. This is too fast for battle music.

817
02:49:20,299 --> 02:49:24,139
Let's go to the other one. Let's go to Chrono Trigger. Ready? You hear the tempo?

818
02:49:31,180 --> 02:49:37,860
Here's that. You hear that, right? That's proper tempo.

819
02:49:37,860 --> 02:49:45,399
I think that Chrono Cross's tempo of it's just like it's too slow down too much.

820
02:49:45,399 --> 02:50:11,059
There's a lot more planets here. What about Doom Eternal?

821
02:50:11,059 --> 02:50:24,340
Doom Eternal is not a turn based RPG. Oh, what did I get? Pega and Altair?

822
02:50:25,219 --> 02:50:50,340
Those cousins. He doesn't know the stars. Ursa Major and Ursa Minor.

823
02:50:51,059 --> 02:51:16,409
Orion. Capricorn. Icee's. Big Dipper. The Little Dipper.

824
02:51:17,209 --> 02:51:29,190
I'm a big fan of the Little Dipper, by the way. The Little Dipper is, you can see the,

825
02:51:29,190 --> 02:51:34,790
I can make out the Little Dipper before anything else. What kind of food do you think they ate

826
02:51:34,790 --> 02:52:02,500
there? Did you watch the Starfield presentation? No, I have not seen a single clip from any of the

827
02:52:02,500 --> 02:52:15,299
summer game stuff. I don't even know what got announced. I got everything right.

828
02:52:15,299 --> 02:52:24,569
I'm not going to pick up every single star. Elden Ring DLC trailer? No, no, sorry. I have an alert

829
02:52:24,569 --> 02:52:29,770
on my phone that will ping me the moment that happens. So I'm sorry. I would have been the

830
02:52:29,770 --> 02:52:47,719
first. I would have been the first person to tell you that. Every single morning I wake up and I

831
02:52:47,719 --> 02:53:10,059
just refresh the Elden Ring YouTube official page at 6 a.m. But what if the announcement drops at

832
02:53:10,059 --> 02:53:26,250
8 a.m.? No, then I just won't see it till tomorrow. All right, so now I will try not to lose in the

833
02:53:26,250 --> 02:53:31,479
credits. And then we'll move on just to give you those of you that know it's going to be a sponsor

834
02:53:31,479 --> 02:53:35,319
segment. We're going to chill. We're going to just hang out with the demo of Final Fantasy 16. We're

835
02:53:35,319 --> 02:53:40,760
going to watch a trailer and we're just going to fucking hang out. If you want to join us, please

836
02:53:40,760 --> 02:53:45,479
stick around. If you don't, then we'll see you at some point soon. Thanks for playing. Thanks for

837
02:53:45,479 --> 02:53:54,180
hanging out. Final Fantasy 16 coming up. All right, I'm not going to get hit by the ping this time.

838
02:54:02,139 --> 02:54:08,459
Try the lies of P demo. I actually saw Charlie playing that for a little while.

839
02:54:08,459 --> 02:54:28,200
It actually looks fun. It's actually good. It is good. I'll definitely try it. I mean,

840
02:54:28,200 --> 02:54:34,059
when does it come out? Maybe I won't play the demo. Probably just wait till it launches.

841
02:54:34,700 --> 02:54:51,940
Probably this summer, right? Yeah, September. I can wait. Okay, I have to be careful now.

842
02:54:59,139 --> 02:55:17,260
Everything is coming out in September. Yeah. What about Trey Pang 2 when it launches?

843
02:55:18,219 --> 02:55:25,350
Oh, some of those Steam demo best things are coming out now, aren't they?

844
02:55:32,229 --> 02:55:33,940
Okay, I'm not going to mess it up.

845
02:55:46,899 --> 02:55:50,819
I'm going to turn it up. I'm going to turn the volume up because it's like a

846
02:55:51,459 --> 02:55:56,940
big crescendo of the song. Here we go.

847
02:56:13,500 --> 02:56:20,139
Oh,

848
02:56:20,139 --> 02:56:23,270
shit.

849
02:56:45,379 --> 02:57:06,729
Oh, no. I thought it was high enough. I was going to say why is this character not in

850
02:57:06,729 --> 02:57:17,290
Smash Brothers? I thought there was room above. All right. Well, we got at least the first verse.

851
02:57:17,290 --> 02:57:39,670
That's all right. We got through the first verse. Do better. Time to play Final Fantasy.

852
02:57:41,129 --> 02:57:47,540
Final Fantasy. Final Fantasy. All right, let's move to Final Fantasy. It's been like three hours.

853
02:57:48,100 --> 02:57:51,379
This is what I kind of planned on streaming for like three-ish hours and then move.

854
02:57:52,100 --> 02:58:06,170
To Final Fantasy. I'm going in. You look like Richard Lewis. All right. Cool. Cool.

855
02:58:08,020 --> 02:58:29,299
Hell, yeah. That's kind of cool. Save the game. No, I'm probably never going to play Cyberpunk.

856
02:58:29,299 --> 02:58:35,739
All right. Let me take a quick break. I will come back. We will start the Final Fantasy 16

857
02:58:35,739 --> 02:58:46,649
hangout sesh. I'm going to watch the trailer first and then we'll play it. So again, this is

858
02:58:46,649 --> 02:58:50,889
going to be we're going to slow it down. This is going to be kind of just a chill part of the stream

859
02:58:51,639 --> 02:58:59,459
because it is the demo. The demo is also available right now if you want to play.

860
02:58:59,459 --> 02:59:09,860
I'll be right fucking back before I do. Let me just make sure this is ready.

861
02:59:09,860 --> 02:59:29,100
I'll check it real quick. Yeah, make sure this is good. Yep. Oh, by the way, I got a PS5 now.

862
02:59:29,100 --> 02:59:37,510
So that means also I can play the Demon's Souls remaster remake. It only took me like two years

863
02:59:37,510 --> 02:59:44,739
to get one. So I'm excited about that. All right. I'll be right back.

864
02:59:46,709 --> 02:59:50,280
Going to take me probably like a few minutes maybe. I'm just going to set up a couple of

865
02:59:50,280 --> 02:59:54,500
things. There's a nightbot timer. Give me a minute. I'll be right back. Bye bye.
