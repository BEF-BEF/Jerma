00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:21,539
Today is a very special day. Every 25 years, the barbarian village of Elvenwood celebrates what they call the Warrior's Harvest.

2
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:34,039
A fruitful, wonderful celebration of honor, where the finest soldier in the village is chosen to venture out far away from camp and potentially to never return.

3
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:47,479
I am that man, and I will accept the task to find out what happened to my old family's house, Castle Griffinsteed, long since abandoned and corrupted by dark magic.

4
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:58,780
I must find out what happened. I must uncover the secrets of my old family name, for I am Carl Griffinsteed, and my adventure begins.

5
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:10,200
I give my final farewells and loom towards the path near the castle. There she stands, nearly 200 feet from our encampment.

6
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:18,870
I see to my left there could be a broken down caravan, but I leave it. There may be a scary animal inside, and I don't want to deal with that.

7
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:30,980
So as I move forward down the path, I think to myself, there's potential for bandits. The castle has been seized many times by many different forces, and my suspicions are correct.

8
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:38,890
Bandits are waiting for me at an outpost, and we will see who will die today. It will not be me.

9
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:45,129
I ready my sword, and I charge forward, or I wait, I wait for them to charge. They charge forward, and I take my swing with my blade.

10
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:53,609
I knock one of them down, and their blades have no effect on me because they are just idiots, and almost totally unscaled.

11
00:01:53,609 --> 00:02:02,790
I walk away from this encounter. What war will lie ahead? What treachery? What deceit will lie ahead of me in Castle Griffinsteed?

12
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:11,460
When I stand right now, no man has stood, no man enters, no man returns. When you step in, you are there forever.

13
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:24,259
So I hear from my old grandmother's stories, and here we go. A castle in ruin, once great, standing tall, is now a former fraction of what it used to be.

14
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:32,449
But this is not the test. The test is the catacombs below. That was a checkpoint. The test is the catacombs below.

15
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:39,819
One can only imagine the secrets and the horrible dungeons that lie ahead of me, but I will press on.

16
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:48,560
I must find out what happened to my house, and I will bring back news to the tribe. A dead end, a choice.

17
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:56,729
One can go left, or one could possibly go right. Oh, coins. Coins, I need these. Cool.

18
00:02:56,729 --> 00:03:06,650
And what is this? What is going on in my father's dungeon? Are those? No, it can't be. Wizards! Evil wizards!

19
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:12,650
I must dispose of them. They might be conjuring up some type of demon underneath my family's house. There's too many of them.

20
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,650
I'm being overwhelmed. I need to find it. Oh, give me that shotgun. That works. Shoot him with the shotgun.

21
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:26,650
I must cleanse them all. No dark, black magic must be performed under here, and there could be hundreds, if not thousands of them.

22
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:33,830
And the final one is dead. Hopefully, I have stopped their ritual. My stomach is full of all kinds of fluid.

23
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:40,259
I'm getting sick to my stomach, very nervous. There's only one way to go, and it's straight on.

24
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:46,319
Through my old family's prisons. You can tell it's a prison because, look, there's bars on the wall.

25
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:54,419
Through the corridor, into the next room, where there are coins. All right. Okay, well, we got our supplies here, too.

26
00:03:54,419 --> 00:04:02,699
Got a couple of healing potions. What's that, an Uzi? I'm going to take the Uzi. A magnum and a flail.

27
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:06,650
I don't want to use this. We're going to go with the, uh, we're going to go with the Uzi.

28
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:12,889
I think that's the best for this current situation, considering it shoots the most bullets. Nothing in there.

29
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:20,040
Let's keep going on. See what we find upstairs in the dungeon. It's the military. I should have known.

30
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,040
The secrets. They must want to sell them to some private industrial man. Not in my watch.

31
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,779
You're not going to take me. I'll get pretty shocking out here. Pick these coins, too. It's all about the coins, guys.

32
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:34,779
Got to get as many coins as you can, so then people know how high your score is.

33
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:41,449
What? Okay. They must be at least one. We're going to go with the more finesse weapon. Magnum.

34
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:46,879
There's one down. Yep, I know that. I can see him. He was peeking over. He thought he was sneaky. He's not sneaky.

35
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:52,180
I'll show you sneaky. That's a one-two. One-two, baby. That's a rocket.

36
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,360
Get rid of this guy. Don't let him shoot another one.

37
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:02,540
I should probably take this. You never know when you're going to need a rocket launcher, my old grandmother used to say.

38
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:09,350
So, on to the cave system. Seems to have been dug out rather recently.

39
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:14,829
The fresh smell of dirt is... I can't go downstairs. I may have put these in wrong.

40
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:20,199
But the mold and mildew caking the walls, and the slight crackling underneath my feet...

41
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:27,870
It's one of the lesser demons! That is Algorro, the third lieutenant of the underworld!

42
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,870
I don't stand a warrior's chance!

43
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:42,730
That was really easy. Okay. I think we may have won. We may have beaten Castle Griffithsteed.

44
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:47,899
I would assume that there's nothing left. That must have been the source of all the power, so let's make our exit.

45
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:55,500
What the fuck is this? This is underneath Castle Griffithsteed?

46
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:03,920
A whole land of strange things. Creatures and wildlife and vegetation I've never seen before.

47
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:11,790
A harmless creature, it seems. But I must keep my wits about me if I'm to uncover the demonic presence.

48
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:21,459
Underneath my old family's house. What's in here? Having lunch, I see. Creepy.

49
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:26,430
We're going to continue on. Another place, another building. What is in this one?

50
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:31,699
Oh, a shop. Oh, cool. I told you guys I was going to need those coins.

51
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:37,110
Okay, so we're going to get... I'll take some potions from you, good sir. Your radar gun.

52
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:43,370
I'm going to switch to the shotgun. Okay, it's time to go. I'm going to go now.

53
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,370
I don't really want to be here anymore. You guys are seriously creeping me out.

54
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:52,610
We're going to leave. One more door to check, just for good measure, you know. We're going to open it up.

55
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:00,959
Get away from me! Get away from me, you vile creatures! You're not going to catch me!

56
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:03,959
Get me out of here! I don't even want to be here anymore!

57
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:10,199
Laser beams! How dare you shoot at me! I gotta go. Time to run. It's time to get out of here.

58
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:19,240
Another dungeon! It never ends! What else could I find under here?

59
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,240
I thought I killed with demonic presence. But of course not, it's a zombie game now!

60
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:29,240
Don't you know every game has to have zombies in 2015? What the hell is going on there?

61
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,240
Alright, I can't be much further away from the final secret. I wonder...

62
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,240
What is that? I just saw a hand. That must be Algulu! The giant demon!

63
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,240
Stuck in the wall for all eternity! I've only heard stories about this! I must hide!

64
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,240
Look at all these creatures! What the fuck was that? Oh my god, a barrel exploded!

65
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,240
There's exploding barrels! There's bunnies! Laser beams everywhere!

66
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,240
I've got to be careful. Aim down sights, just like in Call of Duty.

67
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,240
I remember my grandmother taught me that secret of aim down sights.

68
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,240
She would be so proud of me if she knew I was using it now.

69
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,240
Must clear the rest. A few more soldiers. A few more zombies.

70
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:11,240
What's that I hear? Oh no! He's getting ready to cast a giant spell! I must stop him!

71
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,540
I must have fucked up his health, because he wasn't supposed to die like that.

72
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,540
But that's it! The zombies are no longer pursuing.

73
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:26,660
Have I made it to the final room? The final door? Will I uncover the secrets of my family name?

74
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:31,490
What is in here? Who is this?

75
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:37,490
Welcome, Carl. It is I, your great times eighteen great grandfather.

76
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:44,490
I can teach you all the secrets, for you are the only person to ever make it through the dungeon.

77
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:52,490
So your choice is this. Come with me, or take this at least two months supply of chips.

78
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:57,350
The choice is yours. I stand you will make the correct one.

79
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:02,850
What do you want to know about your father? What about your grand...

80
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:08,309
I kinda want the chips. That's a lot of chips.
