1
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:22,039
How's it going? How are you? Yeah, good. Hope you're doing good. Welcome, everybody. I'm late.

2
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:29,050
Oh, I'm actually early by about an hour. You're almost at 1 million. I know. I'm keeping an eye

3
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:43,859
on it. I'm keeping a very close eye on that follower count. We're gonna do some chill stuff today.

4
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:50,969
I have some fun stuff to talk about, though. Well, I have two. I have a shitty thing to talk about,

5
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,289
and then I have a cool thing to talk about. What do you want to hear first? Good news or bad news?

6
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:13,209
Good news or bad news? Bad news always first. Okay. I might have COVID. I took a PCR yesterday,

7
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:24,739
so trying to figure out what to do. Lockdown, hunker down. Holly is positive, so

8
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:32,230
I'm still testing negative, but I want to go get a PCR. So we're gonna find out in another day or

9
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:36,230
two, because I keep testing negative on the at-home test, but I heard that that is possible. So,

10
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,140
but let me just be very clear. Seems to be very mild so far.

11
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:46,810
She's fine. Very mild, as well as me. I mean, I'm obviously listening to me, right? You can hear it.

12
00:01:48,890 --> 00:02:02,549
I think, I think we're okay. I think we're gonna be good. So that's the bad news. The good news is,

13
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,400
no, baseball's not delayed. What do you mean? Baseball's in a month. I'm not delay. I said,

14
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,879
guys, sorry. I might have, I might have COVID. So baseball in a month is canceled.

15
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:21,509
It's not gonna happen. But no, this is good news. You want to hear the good news? This is actually

16
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:31,349
really cool. I'm gonna be playing Multi Versus in a couple days here. Remember that game? Remember

17
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:39,270
that game? Remember Multi Versus? And guess what? It's gonna be sponsored. So, fucking hell yeah.

18
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:49,449
That's pretty cool. I've been waiting for that game to come back. And they reached out and it's

19
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:58,810
like, all right, fucking yeah, let's go. You're gonna lose your sponsorship for swearing. I'm

20
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:08,150
not sponsored right now. I'm not gonna swear that much. I'll be, I'll be good. Marketing Andy.

21
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:16,860
Which game? Multi Versus. You remember the Bugs Bunny game? That's coming back. And I've been

22
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:31,580
waiting. I want to play that game so badly. I'm so excited for that game. Yeah, I'm not 998.

23
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:40,099
That's insane. If I have COVID, fuck. No, I'll be fine. I'll be fine. I'm gonna be good.

24
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:52,469
Trust me, I'll be fine. He's gonna have, you have to be brand friendly, Andy. Honestly, okay, I feel

25
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:57,509
like, let me be very honest with you. I feel like I am kind, I'm pretty brand friendly as it is.

26
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:05,689
Don't you think? I don't think I'm a brand risk. I think it's just, I am just who I am. And that's

27
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:10,969
it. And I don't, I don't think I'd do anything that would be a risk or anything. I mean, I say

28
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:17,420
swear words. You guys, we, we are the, yeah, you guys are the brand risk, not me.

29
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:25,160
This chat is the brand risk. I, I can behave during a sponsor segment. You guys are the brand risk.

30
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:35,240
That's fucking funny. You literally, yeah, I, you're literally weird. You're naked. I'm, I didn't,

31
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:42,740
no, just listen to me. I can be brand friendly. I can turn, I can be very brand friendly. I think

32
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:58,860
you guys can too. I think we can work together. Uh, the other stream while advertising another

33
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,339
stream, you spent like 15 minutes advertising a different mobile game. What? The other stream

34
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:08,540
while advertising another stream, you spent 15 minutes advertising a different game. No, I didn't.

35
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:16,379
I was making a comment on, um, on mobile game ads. I never mentioned a game. By the way,

36
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:21,980
that sponsor segment was well over by then. I streamed that game for six hours two days ago.

37
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,360
The sponsor segment was not for six hours. I took the ad out of the, out of the title. We

38
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:37,220
were just playing. I can be, I can be brand friendly. Whatever. Do you know what brand

39
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:46,790
friendly? I get this for you. Um, what do I got? That's not your whole, all your conversations were

40
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:59,180
not brand friendly before on that whole stream. 864 P Andy. Somebody tell him. How'd your physical

41
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:09,430
with the bug eating doctor go? It was pretty good. But yeah, I'm going to, I have a mute button

42
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,029
here. I don't know if I'm going to be on cam that much this stream, but whatever we'll see.

43
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,949
This is probably not going to be a long stream either. Cause I was like, I'm ready to go now

44
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:21,829
and I want to stream. It's not that I don't want to stream. So I want to be live. I want to hang

45
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:29,350
out. I'm going to play my time. Is it, is it, is it Portia Portia or Portia? What is it? How do I

46
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:42,680
pronounce it? Spell it phonetically in the chat. It's Portia Portia. Okay. All right. So yeah,

47
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:50,579
you're going to hear me mute sometimes like this. That's for me to kind of clear my throat. Cause I

48
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:56,310
don't want to be gross on stream. I will obviously keep everybody updated on how I'm doing over the

49
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:03,560
next few days, but as it is right now, I'm still, I'm still testing negative for it, but we'll see.

50
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:09,240
I did a PCR and that you, there is no, I don't know what the, what the false negative rate on that is,

51
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:20,699
but who knows? Let's find out. All right. So let's go. Let's play. I've been hearing this music the

52
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:30,709
whole time. I'm sitting here telling you guys that I'm like, I've been exposed to COVID and this is

53
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:41,899
all I hear. This is like not the right music. Is the baseball stream in trouble? No, the baseball

54
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:47,769
stream is, is perfectly fine. That got moved to August 19th. So don't worry. That's still gone.

55
00:07:53,610 --> 00:08:04,259
Okay. Here we go. I have it ready, right? Yeah, I do. So this game, if you want to,

56
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:08,339
okay. I wanted just to chill today. I didn't want to have like a crazy stream with a bunch of crazy

57
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:17,180
shit going on. So this is going to be a chill day. You understand? If I have, if I have boogers

58
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,819
coming out of my nose, you need to be, you need to tell me. Otherwise there's no way I'm going to

59
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:26,470
know. Should I, is it a controller game? Is it a controller game or what? Or should I do keyboard

60
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:36,899
and mouse? Controller game? This is Harvest Moon. I mean, it's supposed to be kind of, it's like a

61
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:42,549
Stardew Valley kind of game. Once, oh, oh, thank you for reminding me. I'm going to sneeze. No,

62
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:47,529
I'm not. Okay. No, I'm fine. Let me tell you something about green screen. So green screen

63
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:52,940
movie night, I'm going to address you directly on this. Green screen movie night. It, I don't have

64
00:08:52,940 --> 00:09:02,409
a date for it yet, but this is the final day to submit something. If you have a video that you

65
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:08,710
want to submit, please go to the discord and read the rules. This is tonight at midnight Pacific.

66
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:16,919
It's over. We're closing submissions tonight. We have already hundreds and hundreds and hundreds

67
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:21,220
of submissions. It's going to be a lot to go through them. I'm not going through them because

68
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,500
I obviously want to stay completely. I don't, I want to be in the dark completely on it. I have

69
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:33,720
watched because I couldn't help it. I've watched like four of them and I was laughing my ass off.

70
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:40,570
So, and I was like, I got to stop. Don't look at it anymore. No more. So tonight it's over.

71
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:53,820
You're desynced. I am not desynced. You look pretty pale today. Yeah. Well, the exclamation point,

72
00:09:53,820 --> 00:10:06,279
sick. What the hell is in your ear? What? What do you mean? Oh, this. Okay. It's an earbud.

73
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:19,049
You look pretty pink. Do I? Whatever. There's a bug in your ear. Your neck looks really bulgy today.

74
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:24,970
No, it's because I have a fucking gross beard. All right. So that if you have a submission,

75
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:33,940
just get it in. This is your last day to do it. After tonight, we're going to vet all these,

76
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:40,730
probably shave it down a little bit. And then I want to say over the next six or seven days,

77
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:45,799
maybe less depending on how, how fast it takes to go through them. So you can imagine somewhere in

78
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:57,480
that week of, let's see here. So submissions are done tonight. So therefore you can expect

79
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:06,139
somewhere around maybe this coming weekend, possibly we'll do it. Maybe if, if we can get

80
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:12,120
through them, maybe Sunday, this next kind of Sunday, this weekend, I don't have a hard

81
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,240
date for you though. I will have a good date for you in two days. So when I stream on Tuesday,

82
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,269
I'll give you guys a hard date because then we, I can go over with the mods and the community

83
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:25,639
leaders and stuff. We can figure out how long it's going to take. I didn't, did I pass a million?

84
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:32,889
You liar. I didn't pass a million. Tweet that the submissions end tonight.

85
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:48,009
Yeah, that's a good idea. It's still pretty early. Let me tweet this. Hold on. 99875.

86
00:11:48,009 --> 00:12:05,899
It might happen today. It might not. It depends. I should write. Also green screen movie night

87
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:28,779
submissions end tonight at 1201 midnight. Technically that's tomorrow, right? But like

88
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:45,740
people get it. If you have something, go read the rules in the discord and maybe. Okay. Oh,

89
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:57,350
that's it. That's good enough. If you have something, go read the rules in the discord

90
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:07,990
and submit it. Is that good? Also green screen movie night submissions end tonight. Wait, green

91
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:14,860
screen movie night submissions end tonight. That's fine. At 1201 midnight. I say night three times.

92
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:22,250
Green screen movie night submissions end tonight at 1201 midnight. 12. Should I say end at 1201

93
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:31,299
midnight? That's better. End at 1201 midnight tonight. How do I say this without saying fucking

94
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:47,240
night three times? And then a thumbs up. That's good. Who cares? I do. This is green screen movie

95
00:13:47,240 --> 00:14:06,169
night, man. All right. That's good. Tweeting. That's good. That's 1201 midnight tonight. That

96
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:15,320
makes sense, right? That people get it. Oh, I didn't say Pacific. Oh, who cares? Why can't you

97
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:22,970
edit a tweet? Whatever, whatever time zone you're in, it doesn't matter. Like it's just,

98
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,610
just like tonight. Look, if you submit it at like one o'clock in the morning,

99
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:36,019
I don't care. Who cares? We'll let it in. Don't worry. It's going to be fine.

100
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:44,740
You ready to play my time at Porsche? But yeah, I'm excited about that. That should be a lot of fun.

101
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:56,019
Okay. You guys ready? New game. Is my face game in a bad spot? Also, nobody is. I asked if this is

102
00:14:56,019 --> 00:15:06,580
a controller game and everybody ignored me. I'll use mouse for now. I think I'll go talk with the

103
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:12,409
research center first. Go talk with the research center first. I think I'll go talk with the

104
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:22,070
research center first. Which one sounds like me? Oh, okay. I'll say it and then you guys tell me.

105
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:27,669
I think I'll go talk with the research center first. Research center first. I think I'll go

106
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:31,750
talk with the research center first. I think I'll go talk with the research center first.

107
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:37,690
Not one. I think I'll go talk with the research center first. This house is so weird. I think I'll

108
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:43,210
go search center first. That's close. I think I'll go talk with the research center first.

109
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:47,850
Get out of here. I don't know. No, that's not me. All right, so we're gonna go three.

110
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:53,460
I think I'll go talk with the research center first. Okay, hair. How did I spin him? Oh, okay.

111
00:15:54,259 --> 00:16:14,710
All right, hair length. Hair. Oh, hair highlight? No, no. Probably this one. Wait. No, this one,

112
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:26,779
but short. That's pretty good, right? Or is it this one, but shorter? This one or the other one?

113
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:38,309
Bowl cut. Bowl cut or riot. This one's fine. Yeah, that's that. That's what it is. All right,

114
00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:48,500
so what is it? It's like kind of like more like this. That's pretty close, right? That's close

115
00:16:48,500 --> 00:17:00,389
enough. Like that. Yeah, that's close enough. Make it wicked greasy looking. Marco. My name is,

116
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:15,430
I don't want it to be me though. All right, I want it to be Craig. No, not Craig. Joshua.

117
00:17:17,400 --> 00:18:05,539
Jerry. Jerry's easy. Okay, now face type. Upper face? Wait, oh, I can do this? This doesn't look

118
00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:33,690
like me at all. It's like not even fucking close. That's pretty close. Lower face? This looks like

119
00:18:33,690 --> 00:19:22,869
Mark Zuckerberg. Okay. Do I really care that much about this, honestly? Jesus. I'm just that guy

120
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:42,309
from Homescapes. You know the mobile game? Okay, uh, I think I'm gonna stick with this. Yeah,

121
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:54,250
we're staying with this. Okay, is that good? Do the longer mustache? No, no, no, no. No,

122
00:19:54,250 --> 00:20:05,700
this one's better. Okay, that sounds good to me. It's Jeff Foxworthy. Who cares? Let's just go.

123
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:18,920
Choose your birthday. I get to pick my birthday? Okay, what month is this? Day one, month two.

124
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:28,660
Where's the month? Where's the month? Wait, there are only four months in a year? Wait,

125
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:49,299
what? There's only four months. They don't even have my birthday. Okay, um, how about fall third?

126
00:20:50,359 --> 00:21:01,559
Fall third? I was gonna say fall third. Do 420. Oh my god, I hate you for saying that. Don't do that.

127
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:21,400
I'm not doing it. I'm doing fall third. I'm not doing 420. That's the easiest dumb thing.

128
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:37,099
Okay, here we go. We're about to land at Porsche.

129
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:56,339
Wait, that looks beautiful. What are you gonna do then? Yeah. We get someone like you wants to be young.

130
00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:12,279
Thanks. All right, so now what? I'm gonna do, I'm gonna play controller. Did I keep asking this

131
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:20,789
question? Should I use the controller? I've asked it three times but I just don't look after five

132
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:25,640
seconds because it takes about 10 seconds for the delay to go through and I just forget. Is this so

133
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:34,200
hard to use a controller? Controller? All right, yeah. All right, here we go. Presley, how do you do?

134
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:48,630
Hope you had a pleasant journey. We're just chilling today. Yeah, anyway, I'm here to show

135
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:55,349
you to your workshop. All right. I didn't get to know my part too well. Turn up the volume.

136
00:22:55,349 --> 00:23:06,230
Is it low for you? Is that better? No one's been working there since your pa left Porsche so many

137
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:12,390
years ago. Is this Pokemon? No, it's not Pokemon. This is my time at Porsche. Yeah. This game is

138
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:17,990
apparently very good so hold, excuse me, hold your judgments now. Hold your judgments right now.

139
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:37,880
All right. Dash is R1 plus R1. Okay. Jump is circle. Get the battle axe. This place sure has

140
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:48,200
seen some wear and tear. What do you think? Looks homely. Now then. That's too loud. Well, blame that

141
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,240
guy. That's it to turn it up. He hasn't been presented to you when you've seen this house.

142
00:23:52,200 --> 00:24:01,140
Okay, so I got a letter. Jerry, when you read this letter, I will already be on the other side of the

143
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:07,140
world. I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry that I'm not the father you wanted me to be. This was all so

144
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:12,099
sudden. So I didn't have much time to tell you or figure out how to take care of you. Then I thought

145
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:16,900
about this workshop. It might not look like much now, but I will brace you for the wind and cover

146
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:23,220
you from the rain. I've left my workshop handbook that details how I created things in my workshop.

147
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:29,450
The rest is up to you. Do your best and live a wonderful life. You always will. Here's the

148
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:38,170
workshop handbook. That's the worst George I've ever heard. It's Gilbert Godford. Can't miss it.

149
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:57,099
That was fucking Gilbert Godford. You're right. Okay. Here's the workshop handbook of your paws.

150
00:24:57,099 --> 00:25:01,819
Take your time and come to Portia Commerce Guild tomorrow. It's right around the Peach Plaza. You

151
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:05,099
can't miss it. As much as I'd like to give you a builder license right away,

152
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:17,299
you need to prove your worth. Oh god. Got it. Tomorrow. Anyway. I gotta do my turn off button.

153
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:23,589
Get some rest. Maybe. Yeah. Nope. Bye, Presley. Thanks for your help. Oh, you made me laugh too

154
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:36,809
hard. Day two. Wait, a whole day went by? This house is so worn. This place is huge. You need

155
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:46,500
to fix it or I won't be getting a good night's sleep. Okay. How do I fix it? Use three

156
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:53,059
wood? I don't have three wood. All right. I gotta go to the com- Do I have a map? Go to the com- I

157
00:25:53,059 --> 00:26:04,089
can't fix this place up. Comically large bed. The glowing objects are most likely to be collectible

158
00:26:04,089 --> 00:26:16,099
resources. Okay. Glowing objects are collectible resources. Chat. I'm just a chat, Jerry. What?

159
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:30,619
What the fuck? Holy shit. Okay. Wait, who's this guy? He was spy for the Dubose Empire.

160
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:43,880
You're just the new- Do you want to fucking go? Why am I fighting this guy?

161
00:26:49,140 --> 00:27:03,910
What? Wait, what? He killed me in one hit. Okay. Wait, there's a dodge roll? All right. Hold on.

162
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:10,259
This game just got way cooler. This is the Porsche Times. We're sponsored by the city government and

163
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:15,380
the local commerce guild branch to bring you the latest news in our city. For free. We're a monthly

164
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:19,140
publication, so papers will be sent out on the first day of each month. If you have any questions

165
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:28,779
or concerns, please do not hesitate to visit our office on Main Street. Okay. Cool. I feel like

166
00:27:28,779 --> 00:27:33,980
this is something I was doing in front of the green screen. You lost the tutorial fight. I did

167
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,420
not lose- There's no tutorial fight, but what I'll tell you is I'm turning the music down

168
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:47,529
because it's very loud. That's better. All right. Go to the commerce guild. Let's go. Is there a

169
00:27:47,529 --> 00:27:55,900
sprint? What is it? All right. I'm just gonna- Let me- The glowing objects are- What glowing

170
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:04,839
objects? That motherfucker's got a sword. All right. Glow- Oh, wait. Is it a glowing object?

171
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:21,349
What's that? Is it a fountain? What was that? Somebody just robbed a bank? Okay. Meet Presley.

172
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:40,009
Oh, I can't fight him. I can't fight the mayor. What is RPS? Rock, paper, scissors?

173
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:49,849
Shit. All right. He just went, uh, scissors. I'm going hand again. Yep. You just went rock.

174
00:28:49,849 --> 00:29:01,029
I'm going hand a third time. Yep. I win. I'm going with rock next. Believe him. I win. Now I get to

175
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:08,650
be the mayor. I was owned. Do I get any money? Okay. All right. So now meet- I gotta meet somebody

176
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:18,490
here. Where are they? Oh, this is not the commerce guild. This is like the president's house.

177
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:30,420
Well, it was- It was blinking on the screen. Oh, there it is. All right.

178
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:38,359
So now what do we have to do? Nice to see you. How are you settling in? I'm not- Not so good. Hang

179
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:44,200
in there. Let me introduce you to the commerce guild. Okay. We're the organization that orchestrates

180
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:50,680
trade across the entire free cities region. This is the Porsche branch. Okay. We're pretty busy

181
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:56,359
throughout the year. Okay. Now then, let me give you your builder test. This is- Do I have to

182
00:29:56,359 --> 00:30:12,680
actually build stuff? All right. So I gotta go punch some trees. All right. All right. Builder

183
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:22,710
test. What's this? I'm in need of eight wooden baskets. Please help me. Not yet. Everybody needs

184
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:30,470
to leave me the fuck alone until I complete this. All right. So I gotta go Minecraft Elden Ring.

185
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:34,329
All right. So I gotta build an axe and build a pickaxe. So I need wooden stone.

186
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:42,019
So let me go out to town. I gotta get some wood. Do I have an energy bar or anything?

187
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:51,849
Where's my house? I don't remember where I live. Is this my house? Okay. Let's go get a tree. Yep.

188
00:30:52,569 --> 00:31:16,200
Can I get- Okay. Let's go. Is this working? I just got fruit. Can I kick the tree down?

189
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:39,829
It needs to be a smaller tree like this one. Oh shit. Look. What the fuck is this? What? Wait.

190
00:31:39,829 --> 00:31:54,440
There's level- What level am I? Whoa. All right. How do I get stuff? The glowing objects are the

191
00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:01,049
collective- Where's the- What do you mean glowing objects? How do I cut a tree down? I need an axe.

192
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:20,460
How do I cut stuff down? Oh, wait. Oh, here we go. Okay. All right. All right. All right. There's

193
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:31,029
some wood. It's just on the ground. Is this shit? Why would I pick this up? Why would you touch this?

194
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:50,779
Well, at least I have gloves on. How much wood do I need to build a- Hit the left stick? Oh, okay.

195
00:32:51,849 --> 00:32:55,130
All right. I've got eight wood. I need some stone. Where do I get stone from?

196
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:01,930
Fight the llamas. No, I'm level one. They're level five. They're going to kick the shit out of me.

197
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:09,299
Why would I do that? That'd be stupid. Go steal it from people. No, it's definitely on the ground.

198
00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:28,700
What is this? Oh, I can- It's like a trap? Lettuce and cumin will get you a- Okay. All right. I got

199
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:35,640
three. I need a- I need some stone. Is there a map button I can press? Oh, what's this?

200
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:46,359
Caterpillar and herbs. Look at that caterpillar. It looks cool. You already have shit in your

201
00:33:46,359 --> 00:34:00,339
inventory because I picked it up. I don't know. Wait. Treasure chest. Ahoy. Okay. You can't

202
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:08,260
touch the water. How am I supposed to do that then? Really? Oh my God. All right. I need the

203
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:24,739
stones. I'm just like a little weird guy. You picked up four shits already. What can I do with

204
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:31,139
them? You can probably use them for something. Level seven snail lob. I can't fight a snail lob.

205
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:48,860
Not right now. Not at level one. Stone. Right here. Shit. You can definitely do it. All right.

206
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:55,590
Whatever these are, I'll fight them. Level tw- No. Nope. Never mind. Not doing that.

207
00:34:56,309 --> 00:35:13,289
I just need some rocks. Ah, here we go. Is these rocks? Shell and sand. Okay. Where are the rocks?

208
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:18,329
Look at the top left. You can craft items on your work- Yeah, I know, but I need stone first.

209
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:34,920
Don't fuck around. It's by the house. What? It's probably close to the town. Yeah, that's what I

210
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:41,780
figured, but it's not there. Is he playing Breath of the Wild? No. This is my time at Porsche.

211
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:46,900
That's a chill game for a chill day because I might have COVID, so I'm just trying to relax.

212
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:57,590
It's possible. This isn't even my house. Whose fucking house is this? Where's my map?

213
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:14,900
Where's my house? How do I see the map? M. What is that on the controller? This is my house?

214
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:32,039
Where's my house? Okay. There we go. It's marked. Good. Look at these things. Mr. Ladybug? Are you

215
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:49,079
kidding me? All right. Wait. Give me this fruits and this fruit. All right. I got three apples. Nice.

216
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:57,400
This is like watching my grandpa play. Like, I like- What? Like, you could do any better?

217
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:08,230
Okay. Here we are. What? I can- Wait. Can I take- Can I have one of these?

218
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:14,969
What the fuck? No. Put it down. Put it down. How do I put it down? How do I put it down?

219
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:21,780
They don't want to kill me. I just aggroed the whole farm. They're like, yeah, don't ever do

220
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:37,829
that again. Get out of here. Okay. I'm going to keep going. All right. Here's my house.

221
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:48,010
I still don't have enough stone. I have to go to bed soon. All right. Let's see. Craft. Simple axe.

222
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:54,739
I need stone and wood from quarry and abandoned ruins. Okay. Where's a quarry?

223
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:09,130
You're failing the tutorial. Where- Where- There's no rocks anywhere. There's herbs and spices.

224
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:33,420
Fishing spot. Should I go up to like the- Go to town? Flower shop? Where are the other cookies?

225
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:40,570
Your inventory is full right now. And the ruins. Yeah, but I could just go to quarry too. I don't

226
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:50,309
want to go to the- All the way to the ruins. Like I don't want to like- Okay. I'll go there

227
00:38:50,309 --> 00:38:57,219
tomorrow morning. I gotta get familiar with the map. I haven't even played the game for five minutes.

228
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:18,630
Oh, I can fix this. Yeah. Do it. Here we go. I can get more wood tomorrow. 20 wood. Nice. Okay. I'll

229
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:31,530
go to bed. I don't like where that bed is. How do I put it down? Okay. That's fine. Homescapes.

230
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:44,280
This house is so worn. I need to fix it. All right. I did. Do I have a chest I can put stuff away in?

231
00:39:47,539 --> 00:39:53,750
Okay. There are rocks scattered around the house and- Yeah. Where- I don't-

232
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:59,429
Okay. I- This- They spawned. These weren't here before. Look. These were not here before. They

233
00:39:59,429 --> 00:40:08,679
spawned here. You got a skill point? Cool. Yep. Chillin' and leveling. That's what I want to see.

234
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:15,050
These weren't here before. Look at these. These literally were not here. I swear to God. I would

235
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:28,219
have seen them. All right. I can do the axe. Axe and pickaxe. He's got delirium. I'm fine. All

236
00:40:28,219 --> 00:40:31,900
right. This is from the town hall. Hello, new builder. We'd like to remind you that Porsche

237
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:36,860
currently has two authorized ruins for you to dive in. An abandoned room number one below the

238
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:40,059
Church of the Light and the Hazardous Ruin in the collapsed wasteland east of town.

239
00:40:41,179 --> 00:40:47,699
I- I didn't have this info before. You guys get it? Come on. All right. How do I put stuff? I need

240
00:40:47,699 --> 00:41:06,869
to make some shit. All right. Simple axe. I need one more stone. This was not here yesterday. Okay.

241
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:10,469
Can I- How do I expand my inventory? Can I look and see what I have in my inventory?

242
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:13,829
Well, on the controller. Because I want to play with controller.

243
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:21,909
This dude's hallucinating. Simple- All right. Let's make this at least.

244
00:41:23,659 --> 00:41:31,380
Okay. Simple axe. One. All right. So now, where's my inventory?

245
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:43,480
I need to wake up. Now, I need a simple axe and I need a pickaxe. There we go.

246
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:51,050
I have the first builder test is complete. Now, who do I turn this into? This- What the fuck?

247
00:41:51,050 --> 00:42:04,280
I thought he's coming to fight me. Oh, they work it out. Cool. Can I do this too? What's over here?

248
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:15,639
Hey. Excellent quality. Nicely done. You can keep them. I just wanted to see what you can do.

249
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:33,960
Okay. Okay. Flip through his workshop handbook. Okay. So, I need to make a stone furnace.

250
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,900
Very nice. All right. Pass the test. Stone furnace time.

251
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,860
Should I talk to people? Sister of the Church of the Light.

252
00:42:48,860 --> 00:43:04,650
Goodbye. Who are you? Emily. Next door neighbor.

253
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:23,320
Okay. Let's chat. Pumpkin pie? Oh, cool. I forgot. This is- We're in like a rural town.

254
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:29,030
I'm thinking neighbor. Oh, cool. Neighbor. You might be six miles down the road.

255
00:43:30,789 --> 00:43:39,909
All right. What do I need for this? Welcome to my workshop. Handbook's first page.

256
00:43:39,989 --> 00:43:43,349
I'm going to try to write down all the knowledge that I'm going to gain as I tackle this workshop

257
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:55,880
business. Since I'm probably the- False alarm. I'm the one who's going to read this. Hello.

258
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:03,429
To me, handsome guy. Okay. Go up to the assembly station podium. Open up this handbook and select

259
00:44:03,429 --> 00:44:09,980
a diagram. Once the framework of the item appears, I can start placing the different parts.

260
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:16,460
To install a party, to have the part in my hands. All right. Cool. So, let's do it. Item catalog.

261
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:26,789
Stone furnace. Stones can be- All right. What kind of fucking book is this?

262
00:44:27,769 --> 00:44:32,409
Just write instructions. Why did you do a bunch of weird drawings and place it like a Microsoft

263
00:44:32,409 --> 00:44:36,409
Word document? Like just write, hey, this is what you do and this is what it looks like on the other

264
00:44:36,409 --> 00:44:44,789
side. All right. With relevant part equipped, aim at the silhouette of the construct and press

265
00:44:44,789 --> 00:44:49,929
A or X. Okay. Assembly station console can be used to view material requirements, right?

266
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:55,369
Parts can be installed. Yeah. Yeah. Overcovered. Yeah. We all know how to do that. All right. We

267
00:44:55,369 --> 00:45:03,539
get it. All right. So, now I need assembly station. I don't want a grinder. Did I pick grinder?

268
00:45:05,989 --> 00:45:23,059
Stone furnace. How do I pick this thing? Oh. All right. Pick that. I want this. I don't want

269
00:45:23,059 --> 00:45:43,269
a grinder. I want a furnace. Furnace. No, I don't want a grinder. Furnace. Choose. Okay.

270
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:52,329
Oh, wait. How do I get to my inventory? Is it I? All right. There's buttons that don't- Oh,

271
00:45:52,329 --> 00:46:02,550
not on the controller, guys. I think I need wood. Let's go get some wood. Character. Ooh,

272
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:07,900
skill points. Oh, different- There's a Diablo 2 skill tree in this game. Okay.

273
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:22,119
Uh, what should I do? Fight, gathering, or social? 20% should receive one additional

274
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:26,500
relationship point. Receive one additional relationship point. Increase the workshop

275
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:34,460
points by one. Okay. Fight. Experience gained by 5%. Endurance issues decreased. Endurance.

276
00:46:36,809 --> 00:46:40,090
I gotta be careful, though. I don't want to go all the way down this tree and get to the end

277
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:45,340
of the discipline tree that the priest had in classic WoW and literally have a worthless talent

278
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:50,039
tree. What was that thing all the way at the end? All the way at the end of the discipline

279
00:46:50,039 --> 00:47:01,139
priest tree? It was like, give somebody 20% more- No, it was make all spells for a casted target

280
00:47:01,139 --> 00:47:07,340
20% reduced mana cost. It was like, what a fucking piece of shit. What was it called? What was that

281
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:16,730
move called? Power Infusion. Yeah, that spell sucked absolute balls. It was terrible. And it

282
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:27,989
was the last spell at the end of the discipline tree. You suck- Hey, come on. It's good. Yeah,

283
00:47:27,989 --> 00:47:34,949
in like 2020 WoW, in like 2005 WoW, that move was like, what the fuck are you even going to

284
00:47:34,949 --> 00:47:49,219
give that to? It was terrible. I think I want to do gathering. Stamina cost decreases by 25% when

285
00:47:49,219 --> 00:47:55,849
using the axe. Tree kicking and harvesting activities have a- All right, I'm gonna be

286
00:47:55,849 --> 00:48:06,010
harvesting Andy. Let's go with the axe. Nice. Okay, so I gotta use the axe now. This is cool.

287
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:12,900
All right, missions. Very cool. All right, inventory. Let's get this shit out of the way.

288
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:24,440
So I gotta use my axe for shit. And it's an attack too. It hurts. What should I do with this?

289
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:30,730
I can convert this into money? All right, so that's good so far. I don't think I- Let me maybe an

290
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:38,489
apple to eat it. Maybe I get some whatever. I just saw what it looked like. All right, this is good.

291
00:48:38,489 --> 00:48:46,650
Okay, I've got the axe now. You get a little window thing here. All right, so now I need some

292
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:51,349
more- I need wood. Let's go cut some trees down and I need a little bit more stone. This seems fun,

293
00:48:51,349 --> 00:49:18,260
man. What? I need a better axe. Okay, there we go. I can cut this down. Cool. Do these- Does the axe

294
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:30,860
have durability? No, it's good forever. All right, this is- Okay, now I'm- Now we're working. Now

295
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:43,619
we're going- Stop deforesting to the land to make your white bread factory. You know what's

296
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:52,139
that kind of cra- Like, I can't- All right, what you said is so funny because I- We don't need

297
00:49:52,139 --> 00:49:57,579
any more white bread factories, right? Think about that. There's really not a need for that at all.

298
00:49:57,579 --> 00:50:12,389
Zero need for it. There are so many different brands of white bread that- Why would you ever

299
00:50:12,389 --> 00:50:20,250
make a white bread company? Even a bread company? Especially white bread. Yeah, I got an idea. I'm

300
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:28,280
going to get into the white bread business. Dude, I would probably highly suggest you don't.

301
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:44,219
No, I can't do that yet. How much should I get? Do I have enough? You look like you'd eat white

302
00:50:44,219 --> 00:50:49,699
bread with olives on it. I like white bread. I do. I'm not going to be one of these people

303
00:50:49,699 --> 00:50:55,860
that sits here and tells you, oh, white bread is disgusting. Gross. I like whole wheat bread. Oh,

304
00:50:55,860 --> 00:51:03,699
stop. It's- White toast is incredible. White toast is very good. So is wheat toast. So is

305
00:51:03,699 --> 00:51:12,309
rye bread. Why do we have to be so weird about this? It's like, okay, you know when you go to

306
00:51:12,309 --> 00:51:17,110
a breakfast place and for some reason people that order, when they order a breakfast,

307
00:51:17,829 --> 00:51:21,190
I see people get weird when they do this. So you sit there, it's like, oh, what do you want?

308
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:25,190
I'll take the hash and eggs and okay, and I'll take an orange juice. Oh, what kind of toast would

309
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:30,309
you like? And it's almost like they close, they close the book. They close the restaurant, you

310
00:51:30,309 --> 00:51:35,909
know, menu and they kind of puff their chest up and they're like, rye bread, please. Oh, you're

311
00:51:35,909 --> 00:51:46,309
getting rye bread this time. And then when I order white bread, it's like, okay, white bread.

312
00:51:47,030 --> 00:52:05,260
What are you, fucking 12? No one does this. Yeah, I know people do this because I do this.

313
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:10,539
I have ordered at a breakfast place and when they have all the bread options, I'm just like,

314
00:52:10,539 --> 00:52:16,059
ah, you know, how about a nice sourdough? Even though I don't fucking care. And then the sourdough

315
00:52:16,059 --> 00:52:19,579
comes out and I'm like, I don't even fucking want that. I just wanted people to think I was

316
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:33,750
not like 12 because I ordered white bread every time. I eat it. Don't act like I don't eat it.

317
00:52:37,179 --> 00:52:44,119
Do you have taste buds? Yeah, exactly. You're the exact person that is a white bread hater.

318
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:49,340
And when somebody orders a white bread at a restaurant, you internally, even if you don't

319
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:54,780
say it, you go, I ordered wheat bread. You do. You're definitely the person that does that.

320
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:14,230
I have to be holding it. Okay. I don't like that you have to be holding the item.

321
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:21,539
Okay. 10 wood and then I need some stone. All right. I need another. You need to be.

322
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:36,409
I have it right? Stone stool. How do you make a stone stool? Oh, storage. Yeah. Give me this one.

323
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:43,619
Stone storage. Stone stool. Okay. I just need a bunch of stone. Where should I put this?

324
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:56,969
People can't steal, right? There we go. All right. Uh, fast exchange. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

325
00:53:56,969 --> 00:54:02,789
I'll probably need this for something eventually. Tree sap. Yeah.

326
00:54:02,789 --> 00:54:06,500
Plant fiber. I'm definitely gonna need this for something. But for now, let's keep it like this.

327
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:15,849
All right. Cool. So I need to get more stone. Why do people hate white bread? I don't think

328
00:54:15,849 --> 00:54:19,130
people hate it. I think it just, it got a really bad rap because people started to realize that

329
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:24,329
white bread is like the same in your body as cotton candy, essentially. So people just kind

330
00:54:24,329 --> 00:54:29,909
of treat it like shit because your body just doesn't really do anything with it. But you know,

331
00:54:29,909 --> 00:54:43,769
whatever. All right. Give me some stones. White bread is kind of like cake. That's fake news.

332
00:54:44,329 --> 00:54:47,210
No, it's not. It's not. It's not. Can somebody clarify if that's fake news?

333
00:54:48,329 --> 00:54:52,489
Your body thinks that white bread is just sugar, essentially, is all it thinks, right?

334
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:02,500
I mean, it still has some qualities to it, but your body kind of treats it the same way,

335
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:06,840
doesn't it? It's just straight up carbohydrates. It's all it is. It's just nothing else.

336
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:16,170
That's all bread, though. No, but like whole wheat bread has, you know, fiber in it. It's got,

337
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:23,900
it's got like vitamins and shit. Like whole wheat bread is much better for you, right? Multi-grain.

338
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:31,369
They all actually, they have like some material. Get on the road. Get on the road. What are you

339
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:40,460
doing? This guy's driving in circles. Are you all right? I thought you were sleeping. I saw this.

340
00:55:40,460 --> 00:56:04,820
I thought it was Z's. Hey, I can actually walk faster than this bus is driving. This guy's not

341
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:09,380
even on the road. All right. You're a fucking weirdo. All right. I need rocks. I gotta go to bed,

342
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:31,849
too. Stones. Quick. Where are the stones? I need stones. Play Elder Scrolls 6. It's not out yet.

343
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:41,829
Would you ever eat a gallon of mayonnaise for money? No, why would I do that? I don't want

344
00:56:41,829 --> 00:56:48,469
to ruin mayo for myself. There is lots of things that I refuse to eat or drink because I don't want

345
00:56:48,469 --> 00:56:56,389
it to ruin a thing that I like. A case in point, I don't, I will never put alcohol into orange juice.

346
00:56:57,110 --> 00:57:01,829
I know that. Oh yeah, make it a screwdriver, a vodka and orange. No, thanks. No, because then

347
00:57:01,829 --> 00:57:07,480
it'll make my brain think the taste of orange juice is gross. I love orange juice and I'm not

348
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:20,010
going to ruin it because I know that I'll be like, oh yeah, vodka and orange juice, vodka and orange

349
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:25,769
juice. That has tastes a certain way. But then I'll get up the next morning and be like, and I'll

350
00:57:25,769 --> 00:57:34,920
reach for the orange juice because that's what I do. And I'll be like, no, no, no, no, no. What

351
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:42,969
about mimosas? No, no, thanks. I don't like drinking in the morning. I know people do it, but I don't

352
00:57:42,969 --> 00:57:48,869
fucking know why or how. Let's drink a bunch of mimosas at like 10 o'clock in the morning. No,

353
00:57:49,750 --> 00:58:03,000
no, I don't want to do that. That's too much. Okay, I need some more rocks. Yeah, mimosas,

354
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,000
they taste good. They're fine, but I don't want to drink at 10 o'clock in the morning.

355
00:58:08,969 --> 00:58:12,250
I don't like Bloody Marys either for that same exact reason. It's like, it's like an 11 o'clock

356
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:27,019
in the morning drink. No, thanks. All right. Stone stool. Let's go. Got it. Okay. So now I got this.

357
00:58:27,019 --> 00:58:37,820
It's time to do, I got this done. So now I can, oh, I get it. Let's put this in the corner over here.

358
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:46,820
So now make a stone furnace. All right. Now what? Can I call this guy on the phone? Do I have to go

359
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:58,619
keep talking to this guy? Why don't I, I don't have a cell phone number at this point. Hey.

360
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:08,440
Okay. This is your builder license. Now you just need to take this license over to the

361
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:14,360
mayor's office and get your workshop registered. Cool. Start taking regular commissions.

362
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:20,760
Come back and talk with me. All right. Register. I got my registration. It's my diploma.

363
00:59:26,889 --> 00:59:36,820
Actually doing the tutorial went wrong place. Sorry. Do you like pulp? No, I do. I really don't.

364
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:47,960
Welcome. Welcome. I'm here to register my workshop very well. What is the name of your workshop?

365
00:59:48,599 --> 01:00:17,239
The steak and eggs workshop. Uh, steak and eggs. I just like want that. That's the only reason why

366
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:32,760
I'm typing that in. I want to eat that right now. Steak and eggs, the wonder bread factory.

367
01:00:34,119 --> 01:01:00,980
White bread, Emporium, white bread, bread. Um, no, not glue factory. I'm not going to name it

368
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:13,940
wonder bread. Jerry's bread. I actually like Jerry's bread a lot. Oh, come on there. Jerry's

369
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:29,989
bread by Jerry. Registration. I have to make bread. Can I make bread? Thank you. So we're going to

370
01:01:29,989 --> 01:01:37,800
fireside town meeting. Okay. They'll be announced through the mail. All right. So we get events,

371
01:01:37,800 --> 01:02:01,300
town events. By the way, I'm the new mayor. Okay. So now the game has opened up. Let's go in here.

372
01:02:05,559 --> 01:02:17,619
You did it. Wow. Shop owner. Let me explain some of the processes for our trade.

373
01:02:17,619 --> 01:02:23,780
I got to make bread office. We post workshop commissions on the board over there based on

374
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:28,659
the speed and quality of the results. We make ranking ranking of the workshops listed on the

375
01:02:28,739 --> 01:02:36,019
wall behind me. There are other workshops in Porsche. Oh, yes. Adding yours, there will be

376
01:02:36,019 --> 01:02:41,699
what? Why are you making us fight for dominance with each other? What are you talking about?

377
01:02:41,699 --> 01:02:47,269
Which is listed on your license. The higher your rating, the higher the commissions you can get.

378
01:02:47,269 --> 01:02:51,880
This is fucked up. But don't if you have your father's once you're done with your orders,

379
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:56,679
you can pick up the commission fee from Antoine. If it's from the or the respective person who

380
01:02:57,159 --> 01:03:01,800
do commissions through the Commerce Guild, but some just build items and sell directly to the

381
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:06,599
market. Some just build items and sell directly. All right, let's let's make it easy. Since this

382
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:15,079
is your first commission, I've kept one just for you. Playing favorites are we evil, evil guy,

383
01:03:15,079 --> 01:03:21,719
evil, evil guy. There are never too many commissions. Good day. That's runt. He's

384
01:03:21,719 --> 01:03:26,599
the owner of the current number one workshop. Brilliant businessman, but I don't like the way

385
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:34,519
he does things. Well, I'm sorry. That was our last one today. Hey, press. I've got a job for you.

386
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:41,130
Or not. What a pushover this guy is. You own this place. You could literally say, Hey,

387
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:47,530
hey, runt, give me that paperback, or you're banned for life from this premises. Give me

388
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:56,579
the paperback now. Banned for life. If you don't just say just take it back. Oh, he took it. I

389
01:03:56,579 --> 01:04:02,260
just run things here. I own this place. I own literally all of this fucking snatch that back

390
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:09,739
and go banned for life. You want to get banned for life. Give me that back. We're looking to

391
01:04:09,739 --> 01:04:19,880
build a bridge. So the mayor put up the money. The year is up for the challenge. Okay, Arlo. Yeah,

392
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:23,639
he figured that place could be a real tourist attraction. What with the haunted cave at all?

393
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:29,320
Haunted cave workshop handbook to see if he has a bridge diagram. Well, one thing at a time.

394
01:04:31,239 --> 01:04:36,280
If it's there, use it at your assembly station. Okay. After you're done with the bridge pieces,

395
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:42,119
you'll need to go to the designated spot and assemble the bridge. Also, and this is important

396
01:04:42,119 --> 01:04:47,639
for a project as big as a bridge. You'll probably need to dive into the abandoned ruins to gather

397
01:04:47,639 --> 01:05:03,059
materials. All right. And I'm gonna keep doing that. Okay, so what's my workshop rank? Higgins

398
01:05:03,059 --> 01:05:14,760
workshop. Alan Carter works tooth fairy factory. Neighbor Wang's and Jerry's bread. I'm D rank.

399
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:32,789
All right, I got to get to the ruins. Get some stuff. Steal from the library. Okay, I got to

400
01:05:32,789 --> 01:05:38,900
build the bridge. Wait, there's another quest over here. What's this? Church store?

401
01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:58,010
Okay, so you want flowers? How about rock, paper, scissors? I thought there was an animal here.

402
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:04,710
I just saw this. I was like, why is there a bear just standing up? I was like, who is this bear?

403
01:06:11,159 --> 01:06:22,789
Church of the light. Okay, what are you selling? Hello, our church only take relics

404
01:06:22,789 --> 01:06:31,320
from the age of corruption. All right, seeds, rainbow flower. Do I have $97? How much does this

405
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:47,480
cost? It's all seasons. Apricot tree. Okay. Need large planner box from the church of light. I

406
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:58,900
don't have enough items to exchange. What? Why do you want like old CDs? Oh my god, this 10 grand.

407
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:16,019
Why do you want old CDs? I'm not doing that ever again. I promise. All right, I got plenty of

408
01:07:16,019 --> 01:07:19,699
daylight. Abandoned ruins. We got to go get materials. Let's do it. I was gonna pick up

409
01:07:19,699 --> 01:07:28,150
everything. Hey there. First time ruin diving? Yep. All righty. Let me explain then. All the

410
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:33,670
ruins in the alliance of free cities are regulated by we said like an open to enter the ruins. You'll

411
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:38,550
need to pay a weekly maintenance fee, but we'll give you a 60% discount. How much does this cost?

412
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:46,170
When you enter, I'll give you the jetpack and scanner. Very handy ancient relics. Mine info

413
01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:51,449
resources becomes a lot easier when you have these equipped. This one beside me is an abandoned

414
01:07:51,449 --> 01:07:58,329
ruin. No monsters or robots in there. Just resources and relics like power stones. Anything you find in

415
01:07:58,329 --> 01:08:03,769
the ruins are yours to keep unless they're ancient weapons. Then we're supposed to hand them over to

416
01:08:03,769 --> 01:08:08,570
the church for destruction. I don't want to hand it over to the church. I don't know. I don't trust

417
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:14,730
those people right now. I don't know who they are. They want old like rewritable CDs. I don't know

418
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:22,890
what they want. Okay. Okay. I'm done. Have fun and be safe in there. Anything dangerous in there?

419
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:28,920
Could I trip and fall? A workshop owner can make money through commerce guild commissions. All right.

420
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:36,119
So let me just go in and check it out. 20 gold to switch to another area of the abandoned ruins.

421
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:57,239
Wait. Wait. Hold on. No, no, no. I'm just gonna walk in. $80 for a weekly pass. I don't have a

422
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:05,829
shovel. No, it's not. I'm fine. I'm okay. Left trigger R2 to scan with the relic scanner.

423
01:09:05,829 --> 01:09:22,039
A nearby relic will show up as globes of light. Okay. I have a jet pack too. Oh, shit. All right.

424
01:09:22,039 --> 01:09:44,489
Let's go. Can I just hit anything? Do I have to dig anywhere? Use the scanner?

425
01:09:50,520 --> 01:10:03,939
I look like a psycho. You can just dig. Can I? I kind of want to see if there's anything over here though.

426
01:10:10,939 --> 01:10:27,029
I can just hit the what? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I can just go in a random direction. Whoa.

427
01:10:27,029 --> 01:11:00,710
All right. That's kind of cool. This takes a lot of energy. Anything in here? Oh, there are

428
01:11:03,399 --> 01:11:27,859
8.6 meters this way. All right. Let's go. What is it? It's a box. Can I pick it up? I remember

429
01:11:27,859 --> 01:11:31,380
Remington mentioned something about this. Something about talking to the church. Oh, it's a

430
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:48,699
disk. It's data disks. Okay. That's where you find them. There's another one down here. Is it only

431
01:11:48,699 --> 01:12:00,500
data disks? I'm not gonna get trapped down here. Oh, power stone and old parts. How much stamina

432
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:10,859
do I have? I'm gonna try to make it over here. Can I just mark them all? All right. I gotta mark

433
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:33,779
one at a time. This one's closer. Oh, there's a stone in here. We have to turn disks into monsters.

434
01:12:33,779 --> 01:12:43,750
Hey, isn't there a new monster rancher coming out? Oh, I got a relic. All right. I'm almost out of

435
01:12:43,750 --> 01:13:19,000
energy. There's one more right here. There is. Yeah. Another relic. Okay. For those of you that

436
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:24,949
are wondering, I have a button that I can press if I need to like sneeze or like cough or make

437
01:13:24,949 --> 01:13:29,350
a gross sound so you won't hear it and you won't see it. All right. I'm almost out of energy so I

438
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:41,270
don't want to get stuck down here. Stop picking your nose. I'm not. All right. I got a bunch of

439
01:13:41,270 --> 01:13:50,899
cool stuff. Oh, I can open the map and return it. All right. That's fine. That's pretty cool. All

440
01:13:50,899 --> 01:14:04,760
right. So I have a data research center. All right. I got a lot of stuff to do. I kind of want the

441
01:14:06,119 --> 01:14:15,539
I really like to have the jetpack now. All right. Head over there. I got I got enough stone to make

442
01:14:15,539 --> 01:14:30,899
the furnace. What's that pig? I like it. I like this game. This game's pretty fun. Wait, we have

443
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:50,119
a quest. The farmer. Okay. Sure. What's up? It's great. Can you build it and test it out for me?

444
01:14:50,119 --> 01:14:58,619
If it works as advertised, I'll order a few more off of you. How about it? Should I do it? Thank

445
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:04,220
you. Here's the craft recipe and here are a few seeds to plant. If you want more seeds, you can

446
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:10,140
buy them from my granny's shop. Try growing them to maturity and show me the harvest. Also, I have a

447
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:22,630
tip for you. Using fertilizer will help increase the harvest. Welcome to the round table. Chef's

448
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:36,630
choice. Oh, cheap soda. Apricot juice. Should I get a plate? Rainbow lemonade. Defense. All right.

449
01:15:36,630 --> 01:15:44,579
Let's get the attack one. How do I not have enough? Oh, what happened to my money? Didn't I have 95

450
01:15:44,579 --> 01:16:00,789
or $97? I don't get it. And Sergillian offner. The all-knowing. Did I get robbed? Why did I

451
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:06,140
lose all that money? Did I? What did I buy? You spent? Oh, that's right. It was 80 bucks for the

452
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:12,579
week. Okay. All right. Let me go to uh, who do I need to turn this into? One of these people.

453
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:41,350
Okay. I got a, you have a turn in here. You have a turn in here. Let's go. Hello. Nevermind. I don't

454
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:46,869
have anything I want to give you that I want to part with. I'm busy. Go ask Petra. I just tried to

455
01:16:46,869 --> 01:16:55,399
talk to Petra. What do we have here? Data disk. Do you say data or data? I say data. You know what

456
01:16:55,399 --> 01:17:02,340
it is. You want to know. It's actually related to how you can discover new diagrams. Data. No,

457
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:11,930
it's data. Many relics in this world are beyond our current understanding. Wait,

458
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:20,470
so are we like a thousand years in the future? These data disks are located all around the world.

459
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:24,069
They hold lots of useful information. I don't, I don't think I'd want to play these.

460
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:32,470
Do you know how, okay, do you know how many of these exist that are just a shitty playlist

461
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:42,680
from like 1999? Like eight tracks on it. They're gonna, they're gonna find these and it's gonna

462
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:47,100
find, it's gonna be like, oh yeah, what's on this one? They're gonna play it and it's gonna be a

463
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:56,899
burnt copy of like Sum 41, their studio album, their debut album. Oh, it's another Sum 41 album.

464
01:17:56,899 --> 01:18:11,270
Okay. Put it in a list. Put it on the pile over there. Yeah, Hoobastank. Yeah. Weezer.

465
01:18:11,989 --> 01:18:20,569
And some of them would be like, oh, what's on this one? And they'll put it in

466
01:18:21,369 --> 01:18:25,449
and it'll just be nothing. And they'll realize, oh, this person fucked up this disc.

467
01:18:26,170 --> 01:18:29,989
It says there's some data on it, but we can't even get it. Like they probably screwed up the

468
01:18:29,989 --> 01:18:39,159
burn process. I remember burning CDs and it was just, sometimes it would just mess up. I wouldn't

469
01:18:39,159 --> 01:18:43,880
do it right. And I would have to do it like four or five times to finally get the thing I wanted.

470
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:51,479
And it's just like, what the hell? When rewritables came out, that was a big deal because

471
01:18:51,479 --> 01:19:00,569
you could go over everything. We're not miracle workers, so don't expect us to come up with things

472
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:04,810
from scratch. But we do know a thing or two about how the components should fit together.

473
01:19:06,090 --> 01:19:12,569
Anyway, just remember that if you find any data discs, bring them to you this time. Wait, so I

474
01:19:12,569 --> 01:19:18,810
can bring data discs to you or I can bring them to the church. This must be a piece of a relic.

475
01:19:18,810 --> 01:19:23,289
You can use our recovery machine in the research center to restore it to its original shape.

476
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:37,539
Okay. Data discs. Stop saying data discs. It's data. There's data on here.

477
01:19:41,989 --> 01:19:42,789
Didn't I already hand it in?

478
01:19:47,510 --> 01:19:48,550
Age of Corruption.

479
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:54,710
Back in the age of corruption, it is highly dangerous because there's a chance this little

480
01:19:54,710 --> 01:20:00,949
item here could contain the blueprint for Armageddon. It can't be that bad, right?

481
01:20:02,699 --> 01:20:09,340
You're what? 18? 19? The age of darkness is probably just another fairy tale story to you,

482
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:15,819
right? When I was young, my great-grandma shared her first-hand account of the time before Peach,

483
01:20:15,819 --> 01:20:21,100
the time when folks lived in ruins underground. The dark age of technology?

484
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:26,060
Everybody fought each other over the most basic of things, and people were considered old if they

485
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:36,390
had to live to 30. And it was always, always dark. Wait, what? What are we doing? Imagine that,

486
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:41,189
because that's what the end of the world looked like. That situation was created by the very same

487
01:20:41,189 --> 01:20:49,560
sort of dark technologies stored inside this little disc. Anyhow, I'm not trying to scare you,

488
01:20:50,119 --> 01:20:55,800
but it's the reality of your builder business. Dangerous technologies are spread all over the

489
01:20:55,800 --> 01:21:02,199
world, waiting to be stumbled upon and rediscovered. Places like the Research Center and cities like

490
01:21:02,199 --> 01:21:10,600
Vega V expedite their recovery. Calamity will strike again. Mark my words. So, it's a priority

491
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:14,680
of the church to seek out and destroy all the destroy them. All right, so we're gonna pick a

492
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:21,079
side. Ruin divers such as yourself, of course. Yeah, do we do we want to collect all the Hoobastank

493
01:21:21,079 --> 01:21:27,829
burnt CDs, or do we want to destroy them? So, I can give this to you. Yes, yes, that's right.

494
01:21:27,829 --> 01:21:33,670
The church will reward you handsomely for your efforts. We have in our possessions a vast amount

495
01:21:33,670 --> 01:21:40,710
of green technology learned through the ages. Wait a minute, I know that look. The church isn't

496
01:21:40,710 --> 01:21:46,069
against the use of good technology that can bring telesis to our society. We're only against

497
01:21:46,069 --> 01:21:57,800
dangerous technology. What kind of green technology? Mostly special seeds. Special seeds. We can share

498
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:04,520
what we have with you as you bring us more discs. You do know how to plant. Destroy them. Don't

499
01:22:05,159 --> 01:22:11,819
trust the church. I don't know. Yeah, I destroy them. I think I want to keep them.

500
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:16,680
Oh dear, you should ask your neighbor how to farm. Yeah, all right, all right.

501
01:22:18,199 --> 01:22:24,699
Okay, so now I got to make a choice here. Do I want to be with the church? Who are these people?

502
01:22:24,699 --> 01:22:33,399
Hi, Phyllis. Oh, who might you be? This is a nurse. This is Dr. Zhu's assistant. Hi. How does

503
01:22:33,399 --> 01:22:40,199
someone's mental health affect one's physical being? I'm sorry, I was miles away. If you have

504
01:22:40,199 --> 01:22:47,289
an ailment, please come to the clinic. Okay, I'm gonna play rock, paper, scissors. Okay,

505
01:22:48,409 --> 01:23:05,510
how about this? Oh, come on. There it is. All right, there it is. One more. I win. Oh well,

506
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:12,460
stupid game. What do you mean stupid game? It's to see you again. How are you settling in?

507
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:28,569
Okay, all right, I guess I have shit to do. I gotta leave. Stupid game. All right, one more rock,

508
01:23:28,569 --> 01:23:45,270
paper, scissors for the road. Nobody's gonna go fist every time. I mean, I got owned. Yeah,

509
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:52,579
you did. My games just crashed. Okay, I need to I need to go figure out what I can make here.

510
01:23:54,949 --> 01:24:02,840
It's also time to go to bed. It's late at night. Wait, I have a skill point. Oh, shit. Okay,

511
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:21,590
I have two skill points. I think I'm gonna do this. Yeah, I want to do I want to be able to

512
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:34,119
gather shit. There's a treasure chest. There is. I thought it was a piece of wood.

513
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:53,239
I've got two apricots. Jesus. Cool. He's vaping off camera. I'm just like making fat clouds.

514
01:24:55,479 --> 01:25:16,569
Okay, let's go back home. I think I got a lot done today. He's eating nicotine packages.

515
01:25:17,930 --> 01:25:32,890
Dermot, why are you playing this? Because I'm just chilling, man. I'm just chilling. I'm fairly ill.

516
01:25:33,770 --> 01:25:41,300
So I'm just trying to just hang out and just chill with you guys. I keep muting and taking the

517
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:46,949
camera off because I'm like coughing or snorting and I don't want you to hear that. Okay, what can

518
01:25:46,949 --> 01:26:01,529
I make? Let's go to bed first. I could build the bridge. Okay, that's the next task. Ding ding ding.

519
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:10,170
Let's go. Ooh, wait a minute. I think I have enough, right? I should. All right,

520
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:18,970
the house is almost fixed. 20 wood. There we go. I'm finally gonna have a good night's sleep.

521
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:38,659
Oh, I get it. Thinking about. Oh, no. Maybe false alarm. Hang up the license. Can I do that?

522
01:26:38,659 --> 01:27:02,619
Oh, I can. All right. Yeah, let's put it right on over here. There. Jerry's bread. Workshop D.

523
01:27:02,619 --> 01:27:11,699
Builder Jerry. This is the shit you get from the Build-A-Bear store. This doesn't really

524
01:27:11,699 --> 01:27:30,420
mean anything right now. It's a cute house. All right. Bridge. Let's see. Assembly index.

525
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:44,439
Bridge head. All right, I need plank. Hardwood plank. Hardwood. I need a grinder.

526
01:27:45,319 --> 01:27:56,970
Smelt with the furnace. Okay, so I need a grinder. Grinder. This gets so hot. Wait,

527
01:27:56,970 --> 01:28:03,380
do I already have a grinder? Nope. Okay, copper bar. Dude, how am I supposed to make a co- I need

528
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:15,880
a- hold on. Copper bar. Let's go. Fuel depleted. I need refuel. How much is it wood? That's 20 hours.

529
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:21,159
Okay, I got 20 hours worth. Make- let's make a shitload of it, right? Why not? I have a ton of

530
01:28:21,159 --> 01:28:33,899
it. Is it gonna take a day? What? It's gonna take a whole day. Get out of here. What else can I- do I

531
01:28:33,899 --> 01:28:39,829
have any other materials? I need two old parts, three copper bars, and a grinding stone. All right,

532
01:28:39,829 --> 01:28:49,109
I think I have old parts, don't I? Old parts. Yeah, okay. Well, let me put this on. Just do a

533
01:28:49,109 --> 01:29:00,619
somersault. That was weird. I can't just place this one. All right, I gotta go back into that

534
01:29:00,619 --> 01:29:09,539
thing. All right, I gotta go back to the dungeon. Wait, what do I- do I have anything in here?

535
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:20,460
Soil. All right, just move it over. Let me keep these. Small planter box. Learn to craft the

536
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:25,020
planter box. All right, I'm gonna hold on to this. I'm gonna store all this junk here, though.

537
01:29:25,819 --> 01:29:32,380
Copper tin, wood, stone, power stone, old- yeah, I don't want to have a full inventory.

538
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:42,020
Fertilizer. I got all the seeds and shit. Okay, hold on. Shit. All right, all right, I think I'm

539
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:59,699
all right. What does the juice do? Ten- restore- restore ten stamina. Just drink it now. All right,

540
01:29:59,699 --> 01:30:04,260
I need to go back and get more materials. I need- I need another old part, and then how do I make

541
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:15,750
the other thing? Grinding stone. All right, what's the handbook? How do I make a grinding stone? How

542
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:30,390
do I make a grinding stone? Grinding stone, grinding stone, grinding stone. There it is.

543
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:45,770
All right, I can make this. Let's make five. There. Cool. All right, now I gotta wait till

544
01:30:45,770 --> 01:30:51,050
these- how many do I have? Zero. Twenty- that's not in-game, right? Okay, it's not. No, it is.

545
01:30:51,770 --> 01:31:00,060
All right, now back to the abandoned mine, and I need some old parts.

546
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:10,520
Jerma, you suck. Wait, is that- is this Emily? I got so much mail! What?

547
01:31:26,069 --> 01:31:36,010
Okay, I guess I can do it. I think I had- I think there was like mint on my finger,

548
01:31:36,010 --> 01:31:44,090
and I just put it in my eye. Yeah, there's like mint on this thing, and how did I get that on my

549
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:51,380
hand? My chapstick has mint in it, and I just put it in my eye. All right, this is just fucking spam

550
01:31:51,380 --> 01:32:02,069
mail. This is just all spam mail. I don't even care. Whatever, I don't care. It's spam mail. So I can

551
01:32:02,069 --> 01:32:07,750
plant some seeds, right? Teach me how to farm. I need to learn how to farm. Craft the planter box

552
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:15,340
and plant the seeds. That's it. Okay, thanks for the help. Just do it. Just plant. Okay. Craft the

553
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:35,500
planter box. Where the hell is that? Oh, right here. No, no, no, no, no. Give it to me. Okay.

554
01:32:39,109 --> 01:32:47,640
Learn how to make a planter box. So how do I do that? Small planter box. Soil? I need to- okay,

555
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:55,140
I've got all- I have enough. Okay, I'm gonna make like a few of these. So I do need the shit.

556
01:33:03,350 --> 01:33:23,750
Wooden board, soil, and animal feces. How do I make a wooden board? Wood? To make hard wood. How do I

557
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:34,380
make a wooden board? From civil cutter. Civil cutter? What the fuck is civil cutter?

558
01:33:35,020 --> 01:33:44,869
I can't just craft it? It's in the handbook. It's the- oh, it's the workbench. Oh, well, I'm kind of

559
01:33:44,869 --> 01:33:57,479
screwed here. I still don't have any bars. All right, well, I'm going back to the mine. I need to

560
01:33:57,479 --> 01:34:09,510
get some more stuff anyways. You can cancel it and craft something else. Um, I'll get materials.

561
01:34:10,229 --> 01:34:17,590
Let's go back into the, uh, into the mine, which the mine is like right over here. It's like right

562
01:34:17,590 --> 01:34:32,659
next to me. Yeah, we'll go back in here. I already paid for this, right? Yeah, I got it for the week.

563
01:34:32,659 --> 01:34:39,590
I got it for the week. Put your camera in the top right. What are you doing in here?

564
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:53,609
Hello! Oh, yeah, I'm blocking some stuff. You're right. All right, what are you, uh, what are you

565
01:34:53,609 --> 01:34:59,739
doing down here? It's a huge treasure chest. I hope to get lucky today and find some special relics.

566
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:11,640
Wait, people just come in here? This is a tourist here. No, get out of here. This is- I- this is- no,

567
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:22,149
I'm not supposed to be here. All right, where was I before? I was over this way, right? I have plenty

568
01:35:22,149 --> 01:35:28,939
of stamina. Does it remember what I did? No, pick a new spot. I don't want to be away from all these

569
01:35:28,939 --> 01:35:51,319
people. All right, I'm going this way. Maybe I should go up. I'm gonna go up. Whoa! What is this?

570
01:35:51,960 --> 01:36:00,250
There's a new- I just found this. All right, this is cool. All right, now over here.

571
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:11,130
They're in- all right, there's one over that way. Secret tunnel. Yeah, let's go.

572
01:36:16,949 --> 01:36:26,939
Your face is blocking some stuff? No, it's not. Not anymore. Termo, you should- I'm not doing any

573
01:36:26,939 --> 01:36:44,859
of that. All right, what's this? Something good. I hope. What is it? It's a jewel. Just one data- is

574
01:36:44,859 --> 01:37:08,819
it eyeglass? What a piece of shit. Oh, hold on. We're going this way. I have so much. I need to

575
01:37:08,819 --> 01:37:17,239
make like 10 of those things. Those smelters. All right, it's a- old parts, data disk, and power

576
01:37:17,239 --> 01:37:22,949
stone. All right, I got the old parts. I now need to figure out what to get the- the wooden

577
01:37:23,430 --> 01:37:29,750
planks, whatever it is. I still got time. This is what I'm doing today, so I'm just gonna go

578
01:37:30,949 --> 01:37:34,939
play Power Stone. I already did, and I beat the game, and it was a fucking breeze.

579
01:37:42,149 --> 01:37:48,859
Why don't they remake that game? Honest to God. Did- that's one of the coolest IPs that Capcom has.

580
01:37:48,859 --> 01:37:56,840
Is there a sofa down here? What? This is the couch down here. All right.

581
01:37:56,840 --> 01:38:13,659
They are? I would love to see a Power Stone remake, or even a remaster.

582
01:38:15,510 --> 01:38:24,649
New relic, old thermos piece. Cool. Anything else I can do before? Oh, over here.

583
01:38:29,289 --> 01:38:31,850
I definitely need to make it like three or four of those smelters, at least.

584
01:38:35,579 --> 01:38:44,390
How much- uh, I got enough. Another data disk. When are we gonna start killing stuff?

585
01:38:44,470 --> 01:38:54,060
Uh, probably fairly soon, I would imagine. Strange lenses. Oh, I have both eyeglass pieces.

586
01:38:54,060 --> 01:39:01,159
Can I make glasses? That'd be actually kind of cool. Uh, I'm gonna keep going this way.

587
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:23,930
I need more soil. Have I ever seen a UFO? No. Although, sometimes, you know, when you hear a

588
01:39:23,930 --> 01:39:30,170
plane go over at night, everybody kind of all- everybody's the same thing. You just kind of go,

589
01:39:31,189 --> 01:39:46,060
oh, it's just a plane. Thank god. It's not aliens. Horse piece. Well, you never hear a plane go over

590
01:39:46,060 --> 01:39:50,630
and it sounds different or a little closer than normal, or a helicopter or something,

591
01:39:50,630 --> 01:39:58,899
and you just sit there and you go, what was that? Holy sh- okay, never mind. Come on. More parts.

592
01:39:58,899 --> 01:40:18,680
All right, I think I gotta get out of here now. I'll go up. Don't ever dig straight up, but whatever.

593
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:23,140
It's a different game. There's no lava.

594
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:40,250
Uh, monument model piece two. That means there's a monument model piece one.

595
01:40:41,670 --> 01:40:47,079
All right, this is the last one and I'm done. I promise. I still have- I have a lot of stamina.

596
01:40:47,079 --> 01:41:09,210
I'm fine. Ooh, copper. And a small engine. This- it's right here. I gotta get my money's worth.

597
01:41:09,210 --> 01:41:22,069
I paid 80 dollars to come in here. Good. Any more? This, a few more. I can get them.

598
01:41:23,979 --> 01:41:46,760
You paid 80- oh no, I didn't- the game wasn't 80 dollars. Ooh, horse piece. Do I have the whole

599
01:41:46,760 --> 01:42:13,460
horse? I'm still okay on stamina. Weird glass jar. 31. All right, 10 more swings and I'm out of here.

600
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:24,149
What's that? This is- this is a secret one over here. All right, I don't care. I'm getting it.

601
01:42:24,149 --> 01:42:36,819
I don't care if I die down here. It's a purple. I need to go down here.

602
01:42:39,050 --> 01:42:52,789
Fif- come on, 15. What the fuck? What is this? I only have seven more swings. What is down here?

603
01:42:55,300 --> 01:43:17,380
Shit. Do I- can I drink anything? Abandoned room? What? I have four stamina. Can I eat anything?

604
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:42,470
Oh, come on. This just got way cooler. Fuck. I have four stamina. I'm gonna die. I gotta leave.

605
01:43:42,470 --> 01:44:03,800
How do I get out? Quickly. Eat the sand? I can't eat sand, guys. Will this stay here? I gotta get

606
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:12,060
out. Okay, open the map then press- okay, I gotta get out of here. I gotta mark what this is. It's

607
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:23,739
right here. Okay, get out. You can't eat sand. I have one stamina point. Shit, I wanna go down

608
01:44:23,739 --> 01:44:39,350
there. That was cool. That was so cool. All right, I gotta go to bed. Where am I right now? All

609
01:44:39,350 --> 01:44:57,479
right, so just bang a right and go straight. That was cool. What's going on? Happy? Can I, like,

610
01:44:57,479 --> 01:45:06,090
drink something? Happy apartments? No, I don't care. I gotta get out of here. I have to get out

611
01:45:06,090 --> 01:45:35,100
of here. There's a chest right there. All right. All right, get me out. Get me out of the town.

612
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:42,060
I have one stamina point left. Get me out of here. There it is. All right, go. Go, go, go, go, go,

613
01:45:42,060 --> 01:45:48,550
go, go. Back home. Sleep. I don't think you lose stamina unless you do anything. So, I'm just- you

614
01:45:48,550 --> 01:46:02,439
don't just lose it over time. That's good. Okay, I'm going back down there. This game's pretty sick.

615
01:46:02,439 --> 01:46:13,020
All right, I'm going back down. Let me store some of this shit. Oh, I have the new sofa. That's

616
01:46:13,020 --> 01:46:43,829
right. Let me put the sofa down. Sofa? It is a sofa. It's kind of beat up though. Cool. Oh, I

617
01:46:43,829 --> 01:46:59,880
could invite my friends over. We could hang out on the sofa. This house sucks. Let's get in there.

618
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:05,079
What? Imagine the smell. What? Imagine the smell. There's not even a trash can in this house.

619
01:47:05,079 --> 01:47:12,659
That doesn't work here. Imagine the smell. You understand that? That makes no sense.

620
01:47:12,659 --> 01:47:19,479
There's just wood and a sofa on the ground. Okay, so now I need the wooden planks.

621
01:47:20,119 --> 01:47:35,000
Oh shit. So, I'm assuming the bottom will show you what you can do with it. Should I hold on to some

622
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:48,520
of this stuff? I think I should, right? I need another one of these. Okay, I need another

623
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:57,670
storage unit. Wooden basket. No, where is it? Wooden storage. I'm gonna make a couple of these.

624
01:48:05,449 --> 01:48:14,439
All right, I'm gonna have one of them be for raw materials, right? One of them for junk and

625
01:48:14,439 --> 01:48:22,710
other one for like relics. I get it. I'm starting to get this game. Okay, let me pull up this stuff.

626
01:48:25,430 --> 01:48:29,270
Okay, this is gonna... Okay, then one of the right is gonna be for raw, but just materials.

627
01:48:30,220 --> 01:48:40,840
Copper, stone, you know, grinding stones, soil, stone. Yeah, whatever, right? Poop. And then the

628
01:48:40,840 --> 01:48:51,930
second one's gonna be for relics. Yeah, I think so. Okay, so this is gonna be just stuff that I find

629
01:48:51,930 --> 01:49:02,680
in the dungeon. Okay, bring them to the research facility. I will eventually... I want to go back

630
01:49:02,680 --> 01:49:25,350
down there. And this is gonna be for planting an organic material. Okay, good. Sort. Hey, there we

631
01:49:25,350 --> 01:49:33,880
go. I don't even really need this, but I'm just gonna put it away. All right, so now I need to

632
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:43,289
build some stuff. No, I'm going back. I'm going back into that thing. Yep, let's go.

633
01:49:46,310 --> 01:49:58,060
Minecraft Andy. Oh, wait, I can make a sword. That's a good idea. That's right. That's true.

634
01:50:03,239 --> 01:50:09,819
What does it take to make a sword? I think it's three copper bars. Practice sword? Spiked practice

635
01:50:09,819 --> 01:50:20,789
sword? No. Bronze pickaxe? How do I make a copper sword? Upgrade the work table at A&G construction.

636
01:50:21,430 --> 01:50:34,789
Okay, so I have to go upgrade the table at A&G construction. All right, I can do that, too.

637
01:50:40,439 --> 01:50:47,909
Bring food this time, too. I'm just one track mind Andy. I'm going in. I don't need to. No,

638
01:50:47,909 --> 01:50:54,409
yeah, I'm just going in. Fuck it. I'm one track Andy. I already bought this place for a week.

639
01:51:01,300 --> 01:51:08,569
You have skill points? You're gonna die to the slugs. I'm not gonna die to the slugs. I'm gonna

640
01:51:08,569 --> 01:51:34,899
dodge roll. Okay, so that's where I want to go. Who dug this? Where's, where is it? Where's my um,

641
01:51:40,340 --> 01:51:56,890
there it is. Okay, so what is in this? What's down here? Oh, I dug like a real weirdo.

642
01:51:57,779 --> 01:52:36,359
Weird. What did I do? Why did I do it like this? This is the wrong hole. Is it? It's up? What did

643
01:52:36,359 --> 01:52:48,180
I, where was this? I'm, it's marked on the map. How come I can't see with the radar? Yeah, it was

644
01:52:48,180 --> 01:53:05,619
the purple one, but it's not on the map anymore. You were going the right way. No, yeah, okay,

645
01:53:05,619 --> 01:53:18,810
let's sit here. All right, here we go. Let's do it. So should I fight this stuff? All right, what's

646
01:53:18,810 --> 01:53:41,829
dodge? L1. What's on me? Is it poison? I don't know what that is. How come there's no sound effects?

647
01:53:41,829 --> 01:54:11,590
All right, we're good. Wait, I could take this, all this furniture? Ow! Is this, I'm at range,

648
01:54:11,590 --> 01:54:19,109
right? It can't hit me. I'm getting a ton of experience. Wait, wait, wait, wait, I gotta

649
01:54:19,109 --> 01:54:33,960
level up. I have to level up. Should I have more points in gathering or fighting? What should I do?

650
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:45,939
More experience? That's a good one, I think. Yeah, 10% more EXP gained. And okay, I got a lot of this

651
01:54:45,939 --> 01:55:03,079
other stuff. Just stay at range and I'll be fine. Please put the gloves on. I stored the gloves.

652
01:55:03,079 --> 01:55:12,329
This is Cheshire Trest over here. Cheshire Trest, there it is. Silver. What about all this stuff?

653
01:55:12,329 --> 01:55:47,189
Can I pick, can I take any of this? What is this? Cool, two discs. Uh-oh, small silicon chip. That

654
01:55:47,189 --> 01:55:54,520
was what was in here. This is cool though. You just find random little dungeons. I do the sound effects.

655
01:55:56,619 --> 01:56:02,090
I think that's all it's in here. Is there anything else I can do? This is cool though.

656
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:25,189
Stop blinking out of existence. Dude, you just gotta stop doing those bong hits. The dungeons

657
01:56:25,189 --> 01:56:32,409
get bigger. I feel like this game's really fun. I would imagine it's probably really fun. That's

658
01:56:32,409 --> 01:56:38,250
cool. There's just random dungeons you can find. So now that I've done this already, should I just

659
01:56:38,250 --> 01:56:51,670
kind of move on from it? I mean, I'm already here. Might as well keep looking. Why are you crying?

660
01:56:51,909 --> 01:57:04,329
Because! There are two in this cave? Interesting. For those of you that are trickling in, yeah,

661
01:57:04,329 --> 01:57:13,779
I might have COVID. It's a very high possibility. But I'm still feeling fine. I'm still not feeling

662
01:57:13,779 --> 01:57:18,760
okay to stream. So that's why I'm here and I just wanted to play something chill and easy.

663
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:33,689
Just hang out. Okay, let's take a little look. I don't see anything else over here. I'm just

664
01:57:34,090 --> 01:57:41,510
going to keep going this way. Should I just pick a direction and just go?

665
01:57:50,250 --> 01:57:53,449
There's no way the base... No, the baseball stream has moved a month. Don't worry.

666
01:57:54,010 --> 01:58:06,699
You should go down. Okay. Whoa, this is a new floor. I can't break this. Can I? Am I doing...

667
01:58:06,699 --> 01:58:15,880
Am I damaging this? Dude, I'm just getting experience for hitting this. Look at how much

668
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:23,779
experience points I'm getting for this. I'm getting 150 EXP a swing. Oh, it's like that with

669
01:58:23,779 --> 01:58:43,109
everything. Never mind. I was already at that one. I'll get this one. Is this not the sofa? No.

670
01:58:45,779 --> 01:59:07,270
Rusty pipe. I need a better pickaxe. How many... Can I just sell these? I don't want four pink

671
01:59:07,270 --> 01:59:28,489
couches. Let's go up here. It's similar to... This is kind of like an Animal Crossing and

672
01:59:28,489 --> 01:59:33,529
Stardew Valley combined. That's what it feels like. I feel like there's a lot to do so far.

673
01:59:34,489 --> 01:59:46,859
It's cute. I like it. What's that? A small clock. I haven't even done any of the farming yet.

674
01:59:48,680 --> 01:59:57,399
Oh, horse piece. I think I have the whole horse. Can I combine it?

675
01:59:58,359 --> 02:00:05,640
I'm gonna bring this up to the research center. All right. They ain't nothing. That's it. Wait.

676
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:10,630
Yes, there is. All right. I'll get two more things and I'm gonna go up.

677
02:00:13,750 --> 02:00:23,699
It is a good game. Yeah, it feels like it's fun.

678
02:00:24,420 --> 02:00:34,550
But I'll tell you, we're gonna have... It's gonna be an intense stream on Tuesday. I thought it was an old

679
02:00:34,550 --> 02:00:43,270
turkey. I'm gonna be playing multi-versus and you bet your ass that I'm ready to play that one.

680
02:00:45,930 --> 02:00:52,010
Also, that's gonna be sponsored too, so that's fucking awesome. I'm so ready to play that game.

681
02:00:52,729 --> 02:01:00,420
There's gonna be a perfect world there. I've been waiting for that to come back out.

682
02:01:00,659 --> 02:01:07,779
So, you better be ready. Tuesday is gonna be a gamer session. It's gonna be a true gaming session.

683
02:01:09,699 --> 02:01:12,579
And you know what? I'll be honest. I feel like I was pretty good at that game. I feel like I was

684
02:01:12,579 --> 02:01:16,020
doing pretty well. I think I only lost like two, three rounds. I think I did really well.

685
02:01:16,579 --> 02:01:34,649
I think that's my game. I was doing good. I really was. Genuinely. I wonder if there...

686
02:01:34,649 --> 02:01:37,529
Is there any new characters? I wonder if they're gonna announce any characters or anything.

687
02:01:38,250 --> 02:02:12,579
I don't know. I don't want another couch. I've got five couches. Yeah, that game does something

688
02:02:12,579 --> 02:02:18,520
that I'm so happy that they're doing. And like, if you need me to pull up a resource for this,

689
02:02:18,520 --> 02:02:24,859
I will. I talked about it before, and I'm gonna talk about it again right now before we play it

690
02:02:24,859 --> 02:02:33,640
again. Fighting games like that, that have tons of moves and combos and shit on the screen. The new

691
02:02:33,640 --> 02:02:41,109
Smash Brothers games, the last two new Smash Brothers games, it's just every single swing

692
02:02:41,109 --> 02:02:46,630
is this explosion of smoke and particle effects. And it's like hard to even see what the fuck's

693
02:02:46,630 --> 02:02:52,439
going on. Every time I've tried to play Smash Brothers, it's just like I'll do like a punch

694
02:02:52,439 --> 02:02:59,500
to somebody. And it's just this purple fucking smoke explosion. And it's just annoying to look

695
02:02:59,579 --> 02:03:08,579
at. It's hard to even see. I don't mind particle effects, but man, the new Smash Brothers game

696
02:03:08,579 --> 02:03:19,880
dialed it up to a million. Those are boomer words. No, they really aren't. I don't think they really

697
02:03:19,880 --> 02:03:39,720
are. Does anybody agree with me on this? I feel like a lot of you do. There's a lot of visual

698
02:03:39,720 --> 02:03:45,079
information. It's just too much. Does every single move in Smash Brothers have to create big, huge,

699
02:03:45,079 --> 02:03:51,319
explosive purple smoke? That's my question. Every single move, does every move have to have big,

700
02:03:51,319 --> 02:04:03,399
purple, explosive smoke? Every single move in the game. I'm about to fucking educate a lot of people

701
02:04:03,399 --> 02:04:37,819
here. Let's take a look. I want to go over this because this is important. Is it just like a

702
02:04:38,699 --> 02:04:45,130
match with no game, no commentary? Not no gameplay, no commentary. Hold on. Smash Brothers,

703
02:04:45,210 --> 02:04:50,170
I'm looking at YouTube. Smash Brothers, no gameplay, no commentary. So what the fuck are

704
02:04:50,170 --> 02:05:03,050
you talking about? It would just be the menu? No gameplay. I gotta find one. All right, here we go.

705
02:05:06,390 --> 02:05:13,930
This is Ultimate, right? We're gonna go over this because I can be a fucking boomer with this. That's

706
02:05:13,930 --> 02:05:34,279
fine. But it makes it hard to play the game for me. It just kind of annoys me. Make sure it's at HD.

707
02:05:34,279 --> 02:05:43,909
All right, so let's go frame by frame here. This is just a random YouTube video of Smash Brothers

708
02:05:43,909 --> 02:05:58,789
Ultimate gameplay. Okay, so let's take a look. Look, okay, somebody just swung and look, look

709
02:05:58,789 --> 02:06:09,270
what's going on over here. Do you see that? Like, why does this have to happen every time somebody

710
02:06:09,270 --> 02:06:22,250
gets hit? Look at that. Everybody has to have like all the smoke flying across them. How do I do,

711
02:06:22,250 --> 02:06:29,079
how do we do each frame? Frame by frame. It's, what is it, forward? Is it, what is it, like K

712
02:06:29,079 --> 02:06:42,199
or something? How do I do a frame? Comma and period. That didn't work. Why is that not working

713
02:06:42,199 --> 02:06:57,449
either? Hold on. Ready? It's just, it's too, it's too much. And they started doing this and it's

714
02:06:57,449 --> 02:07:04,869
for the one for the Wii U. Every move has to have like explosive smoke and like just particle effects

715
02:07:04,869 --> 02:07:13,060
to take up the both of the whole, both two characters. Listen, somebody gets just punched

716
02:07:13,060 --> 02:07:26,899
once. It's so much visual data. And I understand like some of it needs to exist, but if you compare

717
02:07:26,899 --> 02:07:32,840
it, let me compare that to multiverses. There's not this much. Change the playback speed.

718
02:07:41,449 --> 02:07:49,289
All right. Do you see the smoke? True, true, true. Some, a lot of you disagree with me.

719
02:07:49,850 --> 02:07:57,340
I know a lot of you don't agree with this, but like this right here, I don't even know who did

720
02:07:57,340 --> 02:08:04,359
a move to somebody. Like all these like boom, boom, boom, flare, flare, flare, flare. And then all

721
02:08:04,359 --> 02:08:12,279
this other shit like the blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, sway, sway, sway, sway, swing. Old man

722
02:08:12,279 --> 02:08:28,760
yelling at clouds. Like what happened here? It's okay. Whatever. That's okay. Do a poll.

723
02:08:29,479 --> 02:08:35,420
No, I think a lot of people are going to disagree with me because they like Nintendo,

724
02:08:35,420 --> 02:08:40,140
right? Like I have to automatically be wrong by with a lot of people because it's a Nintendo

725
02:08:40,140 --> 02:09:01,739
game. Like I don't even know who did a move. Hey, by the way, I love the Smash Brothers franchise.

726
02:09:01,739 --> 02:09:23,739
Do you like bright colors and smoke? Do you like bright colors and smoke? I'm actually very,

727
02:09:23,739 --> 02:09:30,649
please say honestly, speak honestly. Don't just, a streamer just told you something. Don't do it.

728
02:09:31,130 --> 02:09:35,319
I want to know what you really feel. How do you really feel about that? How do you feel about

729
02:09:35,319 --> 02:09:55,060
that? How do you truly feel about that? It's messy. I think it is. What's the I don't care

730
02:09:55,060 --> 02:10:01,979
option? Yeah, you can do the I don't. Wait, what? Oh, I gotta leave. You need effects for info. Yeah,

731
02:10:01,979 --> 02:10:06,699
you need effects for info, but they, it's just they ever since they, I don't know what game it

732
02:10:06,699 --> 02:10:12,779
was. It was maybe brawl or after brawl. I don't remember it being that crazy where you would do

733
02:10:12,779 --> 02:10:22,060
a move and like the whole screen would flash with like five different colors. I actually have to

734
02:10:22,060 --> 02:10:34,359
get at her. You're just older. No, I'm definitely not. What do they, what do they say? You can't

735
02:10:34,359 --> 02:10:40,140
turn them off. No. What's the consensus on this? I want to see how out of touch I am with with

736
02:10:40,140 --> 02:10:57,130
reality here. The new Mario Kart games have this problem too. What happened? I fell over. Oh,

737
02:10:57,130 --> 02:11:07,899
all right, whatever. 60. All right. So that's not, I don't think that's unanimous though.

738
02:11:14,920 --> 02:11:20,119
That's kind of a majority. That's a majority, but not by very much. That's a kind of,

739
02:11:20,760 --> 02:11:33,140
do I lose money from falling asleep? Hardly. Important announcement tonight. Oh, okay.

740
02:11:33,140 --> 02:11:46,279
19 o'clock. I'll be there. 57 is pretty big. And again, don't get me wrong. I played,

741
02:11:47,899 --> 02:11:51,739
all right, old parts. I played the new Smash game and I thought it was good. I just

742
02:11:53,079 --> 02:11:58,199
just can't get over it. I can't get over this. This new, maybe I am an old guy, but I'll tell you

743
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:05,479
this new wave of, there has to be seven different colors exploding on the screen whenever you do

744
02:12:05,479 --> 02:12:11,180
anything. This is a new thing in the last like five, 10 years. Call me an old fuck. Go for it.

745
02:12:13,659 --> 02:12:28,729
Go ahead. Tell me. God, I'm an old man. That's fine. All right. I got it. So I have a grinder now.

746
02:12:29,369 --> 02:12:39,850
Where should I put it? But the, okay, the whole, the people are going, wow, what's,

747
02:12:39,850 --> 02:12:43,369
who is he talking to? Who is he talking to? The whole reason why I went off on that

748
02:12:44,329 --> 02:12:51,590
is because multiverses does not have all that crazy shit all over the screen every time you

749
02:12:51,590 --> 02:12:55,829
do anything. It's there, but it's not there to an extreme extent like it is in the new Smash game.

750
02:12:56,470 --> 02:13:00,550
And that's why I was like, well, I actually kind of want to play this. Yeah. Is it petty and weird?

751
02:13:00,550 --> 02:13:04,310
Sure. But that's why I like the game a little more. I'm just telling you the way that I feel.

752
02:13:04,949 --> 02:13:15,899
You can think I'm a weirdo. That's fine. That's fine. You can call me weird. Who is he talking

753
02:13:15,899 --> 02:13:23,109
to? See? Somebody said it. Jeremy, the sponsor isn't today. I'm just, I said this a month ago

754
02:13:23,109 --> 02:13:35,670
when I played it. All right. So now I have the grinder. Now I can do, okay, here we go.

755
02:13:36,310 --> 02:13:49,979
Copper blades. Any power here? All right. I need to make three copper blades. So I need some more

756
02:13:49,979 --> 02:14:11,640
of these. Okay. Or bar. Let's refuel. Okay. Old fuck Andy. All right. Let me go to the research

757
02:14:11,640 --> 02:14:18,779
center. I have a lot of stuff that I could probably bring over there. They're going to

758
02:14:18,779 --> 02:14:25,829
add that shit after release. No, they're not. Why would they? I've probably pissed off a lot

759
02:14:25,829 --> 02:14:29,590
of people, but what do you want me to say? I can't like pretend like I can, I can get over it.

760
02:14:30,310 --> 02:14:47,109
All right. Let me put the sofas in the house. They're going to add effects. Can you imagine

761
02:14:47,109 --> 02:14:51,960
they just added a bunch of effects after the release of the game? That'd be so stupid.

762
02:14:58,380 --> 02:15:06,979
These two I have. I think I'm selling these. I don't think I'm, I, you know what I mean? I'm

763
02:15:08,539 --> 02:15:19,859
whatever. I'm getting out of here. You're barely barely into your thirties, but you have takes

764
02:15:19,859 --> 02:15:29,670
from a 60 year old. What? That's come on. Okay. So now I need to make what I need to like a sword,

765
02:15:29,670 --> 02:15:41,739
right? Uh, okay. I gotta go to A and G construction and the research place. Let me pull out all the

766
02:15:41,739 --> 02:15:58,899
things that I can bring to the research center. No. Okay. Here we go. Bring all the relics. Okay.

767
02:16:00,409 --> 02:16:03,609
All right. I got a shitload of relics. Let's go. Go to the research center.

768
02:16:04,170 --> 02:16:28,579
Is the research center in town here? There it is. Okay. Research center. We'll get bad booger

769
02:16:28,579 --> 02:16:36,219
noises. I'm all right. Dermot hates colors because you only remember when things are black and white.

770
02:16:37,319 --> 02:16:41,159
No, I know. There's a bunch of people right now that are watching the stream and they are going,

771
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:54,340
I get you, man. I get it. Hey, me, me and my boys said the same thing. Who do I turn this into?

772
02:16:54,899 --> 02:17:15,100
Uh, oh, it's up here. No, this is not a zoomer versus boomer thing. Hey, discovered something

773
02:17:15,100 --> 02:17:19,739
new. I got a lot of shit for you to look at these strange lenses in the ruins. Do you know what they

774
02:17:19,739 --> 02:17:28,659
are? Oh, this is pretty neat. They're glasses with a colorful tint. These aren't regular lenses though.

775
02:17:28,659 --> 02:17:35,940
That's for sure. Hey, director, come check this out. What do we have here? Interesting. I'm going

776
02:17:35,940 --> 02:17:42,299
to take a look. You can come back tomorrow. I have a lot of other stuff. Hold on. I'm just going to

777
02:17:42,299 --> 02:18:00,790
go to the fucking register training dummy weapon rack. Ooh, chipset. Wait, can I, uh, wait, recover?

778
02:18:02,379 --> 02:18:09,540
Oh shit. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I need one. I need an old thermos piece too.

779
02:18:11,860 --> 02:18:22,840
I'm still missing galloping horse pieces. Come on. Really? I don't, I can't make any of these stupid

780
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:34,520
things. A million, not in a million. I'm only 500 followers away from a million followers.

781
02:18:39,510 --> 02:18:50,540
Is it going to happen? Is it going to happen today? 500 followers away. Oh my God. Only 500

782
02:18:50,540 --> 02:19:06,790
followers away to a million. That's crazy though. Actually crazy. I'm Chiwa, the smallest of the

783
02:19:06,790 --> 02:19:13,530
Hulu brothers. There's seven of us. So, uh, how many people unfollowed me from the Nintendo rant

784
02:19:13,530 --> 02:19:22,920
though? Uh, we said we still on pace for today. Fishing rod. You're the new builder, right? I'm

785
02:19:22,920 --> 02:19:27,799
Chiwa. I live to fish, but a big one broke my fishing rod yesterday. All right, you want a new

786
02:19:27,799 --> 02:19:38,629
fishing rod? It's going to happen. Just, okay, it's like boiling water. I don't want to look at it or

787
02:19:38,629 --> 02:19:47,000

789
02:20:04,020 --> 02:20:10,379
to celebrate. Do a baking a cake stream. Do I bake a cake for a million? That's kind of no.

790
02:20:19,219 --> 02:20:38,139
Refresh, it's there. I don't see it. Okay, copper blades. I need copper bars. Um, I need to make

793
02:20:53,899 --> 02:21:07,420
Move all this crap out of the way. Okay, I need the wood. I'm out of wood. I gotta go

794
02:21:07,420 --> 02:21:17,770
get some trees cut down. Stone stool, wood. I only have eight. All right, I need a stone stool.

795
02:21:21,899 --> 02:21:28,709
I need three, two more stone stools. I can make 28 of these. I'll make three. I'll make four. Yeah,

796
02:21:29,270 --> 02:21:40,379
okay. Stone stool. Did I do it? No, I didn't. I'm not, did I do it? That's not there.

797
02:21:40,940 --> 02:22:06,489
Is it actually there? Refresh. No, it's 9956. It's not there yet. I will say that's actually

798
02:22:06,489 --> 02:22:17,459
kind of a big deal though because I'll explain why. If I hit it today, I need,

799
02:22:18,260 --> 02:22:45,049
I just gotta go cut trees down. I'll give a speech. Don't worry. You'll get a big speech. I promise.

800
02:22:45,049 --> 02:23:14,649
Close enough. No, it's got, I have to actually hit it. All right, wood.

801
02:23:14,649 --> 02:23:29,319
No, come on, come on, come on, come on. I'm keeping an eye on it. Don't worry. Stone stool.

802
02:23:30,360 --> 02:23:51,139
And what's the last part? All right, done. Pick that up. Again, make another one. Pick it up.

803
02:23:51,780 --> 02:23:59,370
Do it again. Because I'm not going to wait the whole day to, I want to be able to grind this out,

804
02:23:59,370 --> 02:24:13,940
right? All right, now I'm placing, I gotta, I gotta move some of this shit around. This is not a bad

805
02:24:13,940 --> 02:24:22,950
spot. Let me move this. This can go, the grinder can go right over here and then these are going

806
02:24:22,950 --> 02:24:49,340
to go over here. I've got three more of these. One, two, three. One, two, three. Okay, I've got

807
02:24:49,340 --> 02:24:59,829
my line now. So now I've got to, I need a bunch more wood. Just keep getting wood. This is a

808
02:24:59,829 --> 02:25:23,139
grind day. Is this technically a tree? Fibers. Okay, fiber is good. Give more points. Vape on

809
02:25:23,139 --> 02:25:29,860
stream for a million. No, I could probably kill the, yeah, let's kill some of these things.

810
02:25:30,739 --> 02:25:47,579
I was afraid of them before. Let's see if I can kill them. I kind of feel bad. I got animal bones

811
02:25:47,579 --> 02:26:01,290
and worn fur. I kind of feel bad. All right, I got a, how many copper, how many copper do I have?

812
02:26:01,930 --> 02:26:05,780
I need a little bit more wood because I'm gonna let, I'm gonna make like 50 iron

813
02:26:05,780 --> 02:26:26,020
copper bars overnight. But I want, I want 100 copper bars. Oh, I missed the like important

814
02:26:26,020 --> 02:26:38,780
meeting, right? No, it's going on right now, isn't it? Come on, come on, come on. I'm there,

815
02:26:38,780 --> 02:26:45,159
I'm here, I'm here. I'm 30 minutes late to this meeting. Come on. Yes, I made it.

816
02:27:04,069 --> 02:27:10,629
I don't know what a pan bad infestation is like. Sometimes I wish we had a tank. In other news,

817
02:27:11,190 --> 02:27:16,469
we've decided to proceed with the building of a bridge to Amber Island. A builder has already

818
02:27:16,469 --> 02:27:22,950
been picked for this project. Also, we are in preparations for the construction of the DD

819
02:27:22,950 --> 02:27:28,149
transportation system. We're securing the funding over the coming weeks and pick a builder soon.

820
02:27:29,110 --> 02:27:33,030
DD. DD. DD.

821
02:27:38,149 --> 02:27:52,579
I thought people liked cartoons in this chat. What happened? Where did you guys come from?

822
02:27:53,139 --> 02:27:59,000
I thought you guys liked cartoons. Aren't you guys cartoon enjoyers?

823
02:27:59,639 --> 02:28:19,319
Please stop doing the Kubrick stare. DD. That's from Dexter's lab. What? In Dexter's lab.

824
02:28:20,280 --> 02:28:31,059
I thought you guys liked cartoons. Now I finally get to fish there. He's asking for money again.

825
02:28:31,780 --> 02:28:36,500
Finally, we have a new builder in town this week who lives in the old workshop

826
02:28:36,500 --> 02:28:40,420
outside the city gate. What are you doing? Let's all give a warm welcome.

827
02:28:43,909 --> 02:28:47,989
By the way, we're all being very, very nice and cordial to him because he's holding an axe at the

828
02:28:47,989 --> 02:29:08,170
meeting. You should get to know some of the people. Yeah, everyone be nice. He's got an axe in his

829
02:29:08,250 --> 02:29:13,540
hand and he has an I'll kill you mustache. What's his name again? Jerry. There he is.

830
02:29:23,930 --> 02:29:28,459
All right. I got to make one more copper blade, but I do have to meet people.

831
02:29:29,020 --> 02:29:36,760
I don't want to meet everybody. You just inherited that workshop outside of town, right?

832
02:29:43,780 --> 02:30:01,239
Okay. Nice to meet you. Oh, hi. A new builder. Nice to see young folks moving in. If you need

833
02:30:01,239 --> 02:30:06,489
refreshments, I'm your man. Okay. Plus 10 relationship status.

834
02:30:16,100 --> 02:30:25,450
Move out of the way. Move out of the way. Get out of the way. Yeah. Don't care. Move.

835
02:30:37,479 --> 02:31:07,239
How much I get? I get 67 bucks. Come on. Hello. Oh, what? Oh, did I actually have to time it?

836
02:31:07,959 --> 02:31:40,200
Do I actually have to time it? Plus I'm doing $50. That's worth something. It was 50 gold. It's not

837
02:31:40,200 --> 02:31:47,100
like it was 5000. I'm about to make all that money with all my fucking copper by Emporium.

838
02:31:47,739 --> 02:31:57,909
Just wait. Do I have to meet all these people? No, I don't. I don't care. I'm waiting today.

839
02:31:57,909 --> 02:32:04,069
I'm making the copper blades and making my copper shit. I have a lot of copper.

840
02:32:04,709 --> 02:32:15,909
Get away from my house. Get away from my house. Where are you? I'm Gus. I'd love to stop and chat

841
02:32:16,389 --> 02:33:22,170
cake and all that like stump. I can't. We're gonna get timed out here. He took a dollar from me.

842
02:33:22,170 --> 02:33:38,860
Okay, whatever. I don't care. I do need to do this though. So this has got this is going anywhere.

843
02:33:38,860 --> 02:33:48,489
Where's my copper? I have a shitload of copper somewhere. Where is it? Where is it? Don't I have

844
02:33:48,489 --> 02:33:57,370
a bunch of copper? I thought I had like 100. There we go. Alright, so this one we're gonna get going.

845
02:33:58,540 --> 02:34:21,420
Refuel that up. Get that moving. Get this one moving. Okay, get this one going. Alright,

846
02:34:21,420 --> 02:34:27,750
I'm out of copper. Oh, it's that's all right. Sorry. I got three going. Not a million. Stop

847
02:34:27,750 --> 02:34:58,360
saying it. Can I actually sell these though? Where did I get this? I can sell these for $50 each.

848
02:34:58,360 --> 02:35:20,100
Give me all of them. I don't want any of these. I don't want any of these. I'll keep one. Sell

849
02:35:20,100 --> 02:35:26,120
the bed. I'm not telling the bed. I'm not going to sleep on that just random pink sofa. Okay,

850
02:35:26,120 --> 02:35:38,600
talk with Merlin. Make another copper blade. There we go. Look at this fucking delicious

851
02:35:38,600 --> 02:35:52,340
Hershey's chocolate bar. Okay, now I gotta make a copper blade. Okay, I still have fuel.

852
02:35:54,309 --> 02:36:10,120
Just make one more. Turn this in. Come on, hurry up. I need to make some new weapons. Enhanced

853
02:36:10,120 --> 02:36:19,770
practice sword. I mean, I feel like I should just I could probably I could make one of these.

854
02:36:21,139 --> 02:36:26,469
Wooden hardwood. I think that's easy, right? Hershey's is disgusting. I mean, it's okay.

855
02:36:39,860 --> 02:36:57,430
Cadbury's better. I mean, that's that's obvious. Yeah, you know, the old Wonka bars were the best

856
02:36:58,819 --> 02:37:10,180
before they went out of business. Okay, so now I'm gonna go talk to that guy. I don't care.

857
02:37:14,969 --> 02:37:31,100
Five wooden boards. Yeah, sure. Alright, where's this guy? We're gonna go here. Maybe I'll make

858
02:37:31,100 --> 02:37:44,979
some money. I'm gonna sell these couches too. What happened to Wonka? They went out of business.

859
02:37:44,979 --> 02:37:51,379
They sold off all their IP. The only thing that still exists from Wonka is nerds. Whoever they

860
02:37:51,379 --> 02:37:56,579
whatever company bought them, whoever owns nerds. Purchased the company, liquidated everything and

861
02:37:56,579 --> 02:38:12,120
then kept nerds around. Okay. What'd I get? All right, that's a hundred.

862
02:38:12,280 --> 02:38:17,500
That's 200 bucks. I just made 200 plus dollars. That's perfect. All right, cool.

863
02:38:18,139 --> 02:38:29,479
Talk with Merlin. Where's Merlin? What is this for? Oh, right. Where's Merlin? At the research

864
02:38:29,479 --> 02:39:01,139
center, right? Oh, cool. Two points. Harvesting activities. Hmm. Or dodge rolls are better.

865
02:39:01,780 --> 02:39:10,809
I think I'm going to experience. Okay. I've got a lot of random shit going on here.

866
02:39:10,809 --> 02:39:18,440
Okay, let's go. Go turn 200 into 10k. I'm not going to go slot machine.

867
02:39:18,600 --> 02:39:36,170
No. Okay, let's go turn this in. I'll talk to you guys after I get out. Gambling now. No.

868
02:39:36,729 --> 02:39:43,559
I took a look at the lenses you brought. I thought they were guidance lenses or focus

869
02:39:43,559 --> 02:39:50,680
lenses used in an ancient AI. Ancient AI? They're just eyeglasses. Wonka was just Nestle, man. You

870
02:39:50,680 --> 02:40:01,000
were duped. But the Wonka bars were good. Different how? These glasses alter the spectrum of light

871
02:40:01,079 --> 02:40:06,040
passing through. I think they were used to fix color blinds. Original Wonka chocolate bars.

872
02:40:07,079 --> 02:40:17,319
They were delicious. Okay. It's not something we can easily make today. That's for sure.

873
02:40:17,319 --> 02:40:22,040
Well, they're useless to me, so you can have them back. What's a good donut? I haven't had a good

874
02:40:22,040 --> 02:40:28,520
donut in a long time. You can take the glasses to him. What's a good donut? What's your guys'

875
02:40:28,520 --> 02:40:37,719
favorite donut? Chocolate glazed. Dunkin' Donuts used to do this thing, and I think they still do,

876
02:40:37,719 --> 02:40:44,520
but I haven't had one in a long time. They used to do the cream-filled ones. I was such a disgusting

877
02:40:44,520 --> 02:40:51,500
kid. There was a chocolate cream. It wasn't frosting, though. It was a mousse, almost.

878
02:40:52,219 --> 02:40:57,659
It was a Dunkin' Donuts chocolate cream-filled donut, and it was this weird in-between of frosting

879
02:40:57,659 --> 02:41:03,020
and mousse. I think they still have them, but holy shit. No, not a Boston cream. I'm not a big fan

880
02:41:03,020 --> 02:41:08,459
of those. Chocolate cream-filled. And I used to, seriously, I would just take it and put my mouth

881
02:41:08,459 --> 02:41:13,500
on the end where the hole was, because it was like a little dollop was on the end. It was a donut,

882
02:41:13,500 --> 02:41:19,260
fat kind of squishy donut, and inside was a bunch of chocolate cream. And I used to sit there and

883
02:41:19,260 --> 02:41:27,100
just like... I would suck it up, and then I would just bite into the donut where the filling was,

884
02:41:27,100 --> 02:41:38,549
and just drain it. I was like a vampire to this donut. I also, I was one of those kids that only

885
02:41:38,549 --> 02:41:44,389
ate the frosting part of the cupcakes. I was like, why would I eat the other part? It was

886
02:41:44,389 --> 02:41:52,149
fucking worthless to me. Why would I eat that part? Guys, the bottom of the cupcake may as well have

887
02:41:52,149 --> 02:42:02,969
been made out of wood. It was part of the thing that held the cupcake. Okay, so can I turn this

888
02:42:02,969 --> 02:42:13,899
stuff in, though? No, I don't have enough. So what did that do for me? Give the glasses to somebody.

889
02:42:13,899 --> 02:42:26,469
I didn't pay any attention to that. Who do I need to give these glasses to? You wiped the frosting

890
02:42:26,469 --> 02:42:31,829
off. I was one of those kids that wiped the frosting off. You did? Really? So you like just

891
02:42:31,829 --> 02:42:44,170
the kind of the cake? The donut? I mean the cupcake cake. Interesting. See, I hated the cake part. I

892
02:42:44,170 --> 02:43:03,690
still do. Okay, Sanwa. Where's Sanwa? I gotta go here, too. All right, let me go here first.

893
02:43:08,090 --> 02:43:16,569
Both of you are weird for that. I don't think so. Grown man only eats icing.

894
02:43:18,969 --> 02:43:22,569
Well, not anymore. I'm talking about when I was like five.

895
02:43:29,750 --> 02:43:59,530
Ooh, that makes it worse. You should eat icing on stream. That explains your flabby skin. Yeah?

896
02:44:00,250 --> 02:44:07,940
Where's that again? Excuse me, where's that again? Excuse me, you say I got flabby neck skin?

897
02:44:07,940 --> 02:44:12,329
Excuse me, what are you talking about? This is the most elastic fucking skin you've ever seen.

898
02:44:16,090 --> 02:44:33,799
That kind of hurt. All right, what do I have to do? Who's in here? There's nobody in here. You

899
02:44:33,799 --> 02:45:02,469
wear a rubber mask. Oh, this is where I want to go. Okay, now what is this? Oh, okay. I need wooden

900
02:45:02,469 --> 02:45:14,280
boards, 2,000 bucks, and old parts and I can make a lot of new shit. I can't do any of this really

901
02:45:14,360 --> 02:45:29,540
yet. I can upgrade the house. $10,000 and I can get married. Okay, this game's cool. This is cool.

902
02:45:31,260 --> 02:45:33,899
I can't promise I'm going to play the hell out of this game, but it's definitely a fun

903
02:45:34,459 --> 02:45:47,350
game to check out. Now I want a donut. I'll make my own donuts.

904
02:45:50,219 --> 02:45:53,750
Now, I don't know what I was thinking about this the other day, but did I guys ever tell you

905
02:45:53,750 --> 02:45:59,270
that story when I was cooking bacon with no clothes on and the oil was just... Did I ever

906
02:45:59,909 --> 02:46:10,569
tell this to you before? Yeah, no, I definitely have. Here we go. Let me get... Here is your

907
02:46:11,930 --> 02:46:24,620
glasses. Tell it again. I don't... Question marks. All right, so Holly and I were making breakfast

908
02:46:25,340 --> 02:46:32,219
one time and I was like, let's do a whole spread. We're going to do eggs, bacon,

909
02:46:33,100 --> 02:46:37,819
sausage, you know, like tomatoes and shit, right? We just, let's do everything.

910
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:44,120
And I was in charge of the bacon, right? I'll take care of the bacon. That's what I'll do.

911
02:46:44,120 --> 02:46:51,079
And now I'm on the stovetop. And I don't know why I was doing this. I have no answer for you.

912
02:46:51,799 --> 02:46:57,719
I was too lazy to put a shirt on. So I was just shirtless standing there cooking bacon in the pan

913
02:46:58,680 --> 02:47:04,360
and just the eggs were over here. There was... She was doing something over on the other side.

914
02:47:04,360 --> 02:47:06,760
Like we were preparing stuff and I was just sitting there cooking the bacon and it was

915
02:47:06,760 --> 02:47:16,899
just splashing oil, just hitting me in the chest. I just kept on going, oh, oh, oh,

916
02:47:17,780 --> 02:47:22,500
this is fucking burning me. I was just getting splashed with oil and I didn't even care.

917
02:47:23,139 --> 02:47:28,780
I didn't even care. I didn't move. It was just kind of hurting me. And Holly's just like,

918
02:47:28,780 --> 02:47:33,420
what are you doing? What are you doing? And I'm just like, I'm fine. I'm fine. It's not a big deal

919
02:47:33,420 --> 02:47:39,819
because I just, okay, I got to go put a shirt on now. No, I'm just, whatever. I'm just going to let

920
02:47:39,819 --> 02:47:52,549
it happen. It didn't hurt that much, right? You're a Sims NPC. I just remember hearing like the pop,

921
02:47:52,549 --> 02:48:01,059
pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. It was just like, I had these little red dot marks all over my chest.

922
02:48:05,780 --> 02:48:10,260
But Holly laughs. She's like, I keep remembering. You're just sitting there like shaking it with

923
02:48:10,260 --> 02:48:18,149
like pajama pants on, like tired. It was early in the morning. Just like, ah, it must've been so

924
02:48:18,149 --> 02:48:29,129
fucking crazy looking. And this wasn't 10 seconds. This was probably five straight minutes. I had

925
02:48:29,129 --> 02:48:39,719
been doing it for like at least a few minutes, right? You're a Skyrim NPC. Source engine NPC

926
02:48:39,719 --> 02:48:57,340
standing in fire. But I didn't care enough. Look, the pain threshold that I had to, all right, so

927
02:48:57,340 --> 02:49:03,430
put on a shirt so you don't get splashed with bacon oil and it hurts. It didn't cross that

928
02:49:03,430 --> 02:49:07,829
certain pain threshold. It was just enough where it was like, I don't care. If it was any higher,

929
02:49:08,569 --> 02:49:14,840
I would have put on, I would have put one on. We have aprons. Yeah, but the apron wouldn't even

930
02:49:14,840 --> 02:49:21,059
matter. Okay, so here's why the apron doesn't matter. If I had an apron on, aprons are from

931
02:49:21,059 --> 02:49:31,750
like here down. All this is still skin and flesh, all here. It's still, it was like the neck.

932
02:49:34,860 --> 02:49:52,569
What kind of apron? Aprons are like overalls. You're wearing it wrong? There's only one way

933
02:49:52,569 --> 02:49:59,370
an apron goes on and it doesn't cover your arms, bare arms, bare neck and clavicle area.

934
02:50:01,510 --> 02:50:12,870
I wasn't gonna go put a sweater on. Skill issue. So wear a shirt. But I would have to go get it. I

935
02:50:12,870 --> 02:50:26,780
didn't want to go get it. That was a lot of experience. 500 bucks too. Holy smokes. Wait,

936
02:50:26,780 --> 02:50:40,040
you make bread? That's what my place is called. Okay, has he given the speech yet? I haven't hit

937
02:50:40,040 --> 02:50:57,049
a million followers yet. I'm not gonna go gamble it. Did I have 100 copper ore? This is not doing

938
02:50:57,049 --> 02:51:08,459
anything for me. Should I go buy some clothes? Oh yeah, let's do it. Okay, work clothes.

939
02:51:12,280 --> 02:51:19,430
This is too much money. Okay, I did all those missions. I have some money now. Let's go back.

940
02:51:20,309 --> 02:51:43,340
You have a bread place. Take off the mask. All right, I need to build the bridge. Let's go back

941
02:51:43,340 --> 02:52:05,719
home and assess what I need to build the bridge. I have to build the bridge. Okay, copper, hard wood

942
02:52:06,969 --> 02:52:18,790
and copper pipe. I need 20. Where do I get hardwood from? Do I have to make it? I think I

943
02:52:18,790 --> 02:52:35,479
have to make it. Hardwood. How do I make hardwood? How do I make hardwood? You have to upgrade your

944
02:52:35,479 --> 02:53:01,940
axe. Do I? I need a civil cutter. Okay. Stone, brick, copper, blade. All right. I have, I can

945
02:53:02,579 --> 02:53:11,959
look at these chocolates. Let's make some more. Let's make like, I don't know, three copper blades.

946
02:53:12,760 --> 02:53:26,569
And then what else is this? Stone, brick. How do I make a fucking stone brick? Stone, brick. What the

947
02:53:26,569 --> 02:54:01,260
fuck? How do I make a stone brick? Tin ore. How do I make a stone brick? It's in the furnace. Stone,

948
02:54:01,260 --> 02:54:08,579
brick. Ah, there it is. All right, dude. How many do I need? Yeah, I'll make this over here.

949
02:54:13,620 --> 02:54:32,250
My nose. It's like a bug in my nose. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. Two seconds.

950
02:56:42,520 --> 02:56:47,190
Hey, one more second. I'm just blowing my nose. I'll be right back. I'm good. Two seconds.

951
02:58:30,120 --> 02:58:34,120
Oh shit, I forgot to put up the BRB thing. It's all right.

952
02:58:39,180 --> 02:58:52,139
Shit. Shit. We're fine. Everybody relax. I'm fine. Yeah, I just had to blow my nose really quickly.

953
02:58:52,780 --> 02:58:55,340
It felt like there were bugs in my nose, but that's not what it was.

954
02:58:56,059 --> 02:59:21,110
I just had to go blow my nose. It's like heavy. Snorting bugs in the bathroom. It sounds like,

955
02:59:21,110 --> 02:59:40,979
it's like a rock band title for an album or something. Yeah, and here from their new album,

956
02:59:42,100 --> 03:00:00,170
Pain, is snorting bugs in the bathroom. Copper blade and stone brick. Did I get it?

957
03:00:00,170 --> 03:00:13,299
I only made two of these? What are you, out of your mind? I need way more than that. Oh, I need

958
03:00:13,299 --> 03:00:35,059
wood. I don't have any wood, do I? Gotta go cut down some more trees. Let's go. I feel like I'm

959
03:00:35,059 --> 03:00:53,020
depleting the forest over here. There's some bugs hanging out of your nose. That's all right. No,

960
03:00:53,020 --> 03:00:59,180
I need 200 followers. This is crazy. I actually think I'm going to hit it today. It's going to

961
03:00:59,180 --> 03:01:03,879
happen today. Oh, I got to think of something to say. Actually, I know what to say. I know what

962
03:01:03,879 --> 03:01:08,600
to say. I've been practicing in the mirror for months. I've been practicing this speech in the

963
03:01:08,600 --> 03:01:29,739
mirror for three months. I know it. I wrote it down too. I have a whole script. It's about seven

964
03:01:29,739 --> 03:01:34,579
or eight pages long. It's not going to take long. This is a quick speech talking about the channel

965
03:01:34,579 --> 03:02:00,809
and everything. It's probably be about 30 to 40 minutes in total length. It's going to be a full

966
03:02:00,809 --> 03:02:12,790
state of the union. I hope I don't get emotional. I might get emotional. I might start crying.

967
03:02:13,510 --> 03:02:26,979
I'm going to cry. I've got to be careful here. I want enough wood where I never have to cut a

968
03:02:26,979 --> 03:02:52,629
tree down again. That's what I want. How much wood? I'm going to cut down every single tree that I

969
03:02:52,629 --> 03:03:11,430
physically can around my residence. This might not be the game for you, dude. Who is this game for,

970
03:03:11,430 --> 03:03:21,159
then? It's a game where you run around and chop trees down and do errands and stuff. Who is this

971
03:03:22,040 --> 03:03:33,670
before, then? It's just a fun, chill game. Dude, this ain't for you. What is for me?

972
03:03:36,069 --> 03:03:39,590
What do you guys think is a game for me? If you're like, that's a game for you.

big deal all right let me give you my speech here's my speech this is a big

1049
03:22:53,020 --> 03:23:02,850
deal to me because my old YouTube channel right just German 985 second

1050
03:23:02,850 --> 03:23:08,309
German Twitter doesn't matter I've never been to a million followers across any

1051
03:23:08,309 --> 03:23:13,149
platform even the old YouTube channel even to German 985 did not have a

1052
03:23:13,149 --> 03:23:19,000
million subscribers once I got to about five or six hundred thousand I stopped

1053
03:23:19,000 --> 03:23:25,860
doing YouTube videos right moved over here the second channel doesn't have a

1054
03:23:25,860 --> 03:23:33,309
million this is the first place where I've ever had a million followers so

1055
03:23:33,309 --> 03:23:40,739
that's really that's crazy I know that there's a lot of other people that have

1056
