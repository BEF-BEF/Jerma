00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,980
Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2, Monday's edition. Hold on, somebody is trying to call me.

2
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:21,980
I want to show you something before this gets started. This is the goofiest dog ever. It's not Otto. Let's take a look.

3
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:32,659
Hello, my name is Rishi. So this is a dog that I'm dog sitting for right now. One of my sister's friends. It's her dog.

4
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:37,659
He's just sitting here, or she's just sitting here on my lap, and she's going to be there for the remainder of the video.

5
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:45,659
Don't worry, Otto is okay. He's down here. He was up there earlier, so I have plenty of time between the two dogs on the lap.

6
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:50,090
So don't worry, I have not forgotten about Otto. But anyways, just wanted to show you that I thought that was really funny.

7
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,090
A little Chihuahua dog. So let's get started with Facecam Fortress 2.

8
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:09,230
So let's get started here playing as the spy with the ambassador, the Spicycle, and the, not the red tape recorder, the regular Sapper on Dust Bowl.

9
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:16,109
Yeah, baby. Dust Bowl, baby. I also have the regular watch on today, and I'm going to get myself killed.

10
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:26,700
Wow, wow, wow. Me and live spy don't do very well, as you've seen in previous videos, but this heavy. Oh, give me a headshot.

11
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:39,060
That's a spy right there. Did I bump into a spy? Yeah. Yikes. Get away. No. Actually, what am I doing? I have the Spicycle.

12
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:50,560
What the hell am I doing? Popper, anybody here? Hmm. Don't look like it. Got to get the health that's here.

13
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:58,060
I got to be real sneaky about this, guys. Hey, there's this goat. How did I miss him?

14
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:04,900
All right, this is good, good, good, good, good. This is what I want. I want them all to come out so I can get behind everybody.

15
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:13,870
Probably not a good place to decloak, but I want the health. All right, let's go up here. What is going on right now?

16
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:21,050
Everyone's just, like, spawn camping. Oh, this is a good spot. Hey, everybody. I'm disguised as that guy, I think.

17
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:31,229
Oy, oy, oy, oy, oy. Come on, do it again. Oh, he's fully charged. Oh, my God. That guy's probably so mad.

18
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:39,849
I just ruined that guy's Uber. I'm sorry, bro. I know how that feels. It's not a good feeling.

19
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:47,539
And we got a sniper coming in. Here we go. This is where I get found out. Nope, not quite yet.

20
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:56,060
Little dog is walking on my lap. Little dog. No, we're okay. I got to stop disguising as a scout.

21
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:06,439
Hey, little dog, what are you doing? Come here. Spy pyro down here, I see. I could smell ya from a mile away.

22
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:20,900
Come on, where is he? Oh! Thanks for the teleporter, mate. Can I headshot this guy? No, I was gonna go for it.

23
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:37,219
I was gonna go for it. What's this guy's health? Oh, that was pretty. That was a pretty little thing, if I do say so myself.

24
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:44,460
Give me this. Walking around with a bottle. Can I get another one? Wow, that's why I want to make my escape.

25
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:54,379
Make my escape. Oh, I thought I got him. I guess I was wrong. Sometimes you're wrong. Hey, what are you doing?

26
00:03:54,379 --> 00:04:01,110
Come here. Hey, what's the matter with you, huh? Sit back down. You're being crazy.

27
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:07,379
I love right when I start recording. This is great. So I was playing with Boo for a little while before this.

28
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:15,379
We actually went to get food in separate places, and he was as calm, as collected as you could be.

29
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:27,500
Now he's kind of going all over the place. No! Pull it out. Oh yeah, Spycicle, baby. Spycicle gets you away from those pesky pyros.

30
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:35,819
But now all I got is this, and that guy saw right through me. You want to call somebody on the phone? Okay, ready?

31
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:45,959
He's like, what the heck? I don't know if you can see that or not. That's funny. Is that guy's name Wonder Bread? Wonder Bread.

32
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:57,540
I love Wonder Bread, especially in the toaster with cheese on it. Oh no, we're gonna get capped. Oh, and that's the end of the game.

33
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:10,620
Quick taunt. Oh well. Please don't kill me. See what happened right there, Reese? We lost. We lost the game.

34
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,860
I know it's very, very horrible. Very treacherous. But we get to go again, though. That's the good thing. Don't worry.

35
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:22,100
You know, you never have to worry in these situations. Look in the audience. What do you think they have to say about this?

36
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:32,060
I don't know, but I'm too tired. It's okay, little dog. I like to call them little dog. I like to call her little dog.

37
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:38,689
Here's one thing that I, actually, we'll time travel through setup time, then I'll tell you my story.

38
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:48,860
Okay, so what I was gonna say before is every single animal I've ever had has been a male. Every single one.

39
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:55,910
And I don't know if that's because I just don't, I don't know why that is. I just happen to be every animal.

40
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:02,500
Actually, one cat. One cat that we had a long time ago when I was, geez, I was probably 10 years old.

41
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:09,180
We had a cat that his name was, her name was Maggie. But other than that, it's, I've had like 10 animals.

42
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:15,250
And all of them have been male, and now we are spawn camping. I haven't, I've, just please kill me.

43
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:21,740
Now should I just, you know, that's what we're gonna do. Change the other team, quick. And stay spy.

44
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:28,579
See if, see if I can't make something happen here. Dead ringer. Oh, where you going, dog?

45
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:40,089
Dead ring? Can we dead ring out of here? Okay, we're alright. Okay. There we go. There we go.

46
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:49,990
I am not a spy. You don't know. Hey, I got the kook rail. Looking for those pesky spy bastards.

47
00:06:49,990 --> 00:07:00,920
That is a medic being shot in the back. I need my knife. I'm gonna get that knife. We got up here.

48
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:11,180
Anything? Got a lot of stuff. Oh, he got the health. It's alright. Take a, that's what I wanted. That's what I wanted.

49
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:20,500
Get out of my face. Oh, this is not good. Standing right in this guy's face. Oh my god.

50
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:29,660
I thought I was gonna be able to backstab him. Oh, hey, come on, coitus, coitus. What do you got for a loadout?

51
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:39,550
The black rose. Where'd he go? He like, disappeared. So can we win this? Are we gonna come back from being, well actually, come back.

52
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:46,550
Well, I was on the other team and I, I was, actually I didn't really contribute to this at all. I was kind of just standing there talking.

53
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:54,699
And somebody is calling my phone. This dog is like, what is that? It's a phone. It's just a phone. Don't worry.

54
00:07:54,699 --> 00:08:11,350
Let's get them boys. No, you were right. I was a spy. Now I'm a sniper. Oh, come on. Oh my god, this tree killed me.

55
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:18,819
Listen, I can't talk right now. Buddy, whoever you are. That wasn't even Burger Boy. Who the hell was that?

56
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:27,029
That was like a random number. Like a bunch of random digits I've never seen before. I never answer those phone calls.

57
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:36,279
Let me know in the comments section if you ever answer. Hello. If you ever answer. What are you doing? What are you doing, dog?

58
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:46,759
Oh my god, dog. You can't really. How did I kill that scout? I can't, I could not tell you. Let's go. Let's go for this tap.

59
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:56,759
It's a tap. You are being a real, I can't even like play this game. Oh my god. Alright, listen. Listen, I know you want like kisses right now, but I'm like playing a game.

60
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:10,500
Yeah. Alright, here. Mwah, there's one for you. So get, get back dog. You little freak. I gotta, I gotta get a good sap and stab.

61
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:25,620
I got dog lap issues. Thanks, dog. Oh, watch it. Watch it. Little dog. Little dog jumping. Little dog jumping up a lap.

62
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:38,889
No, he's not. Anywhere to be seen. He is not. Oh no, there he is. Oh, come on. I had it. No, dog. Come here. Come hither.

63
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:50,879
Alright, you want to get down? Get down this way. Go that way. Now he's going to, I have 10 bucks. 10 bucks as he starts crying.

64
00:09:50,879 --> 00:10:08,669
He's going to be going, wee, wee, wee. Is that a heavy right there? No, it's an engineer all the way back here. Oh, I just heard him. I just heard him go.

65
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:18,759
I gotta, alright, time to, I'm going to switch off a spy after this. I'm going to go demo and I'm going to try and just take out all the stuff.

66
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:30,220
Oh man, oh man. He, the guy knows. He knows. He knows. They all know. They all know. Get him. Get him. I got him. Is there another set? Oh, there's another engineer.

67
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:40,990
Damn it. Alright, let's do this. Where you going? What is this setup? Oh, we need that engineer to build a teleporter. Oh, he's got one built.

68
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:52,220
What is going on here? Did he just, he just taunt killed somebody. Did you see that? That guy just taunt killed that pyro. Are you a spy?

69
00:10:52,220 --> 00:11:03,940
No, you're not. But you, on the other hand, are going to get killed by the sentry that's in that room. Don't let him get it. Kill this guy. Shoot him. Do anything.

70
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:17,129
Man, this is bad. Wall. Come on, off the wall. Please let me in. Please let me in there. Anybody else? There's the sentry.

71
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:26,899
Alright, if I can, I gotta figure out a solution here. This has got to go like this. There's two sentries over there.

72
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:38,210
There's, we got one. Me and the, oh, what the hell, add. Both are down. Both are down. Both sentries are down. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

73
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:49,340
Come on. Come on. Come on. Oh, only a minute and 50. What? How is this heavy Keith getting back here? He's back here like every time.

74
00:11:49,340 --> 00:12:01,299
I was going to sticky jump. What? I just killed somebody. No, I didn't. It's this fake scout right here. That was ridiculous though.

75
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:10,879
And what happened? What's going on with my frame rate? My like frame, hold on. My frame rate's like exploding right now. That was crazy.

76
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:21,179
Yeah, I don't think this is happening. Very ironic. I switched teams and what's, maybe I'm just going crazy. My frame rate looks like it's dying though.

77
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:30,980
According to DX story, that's not the case. But what on earth? They have a teleporter over here. There is a teleporter right here. This has to go down right now.

78
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:43,580
This has to happen right now. Who is in this room, dude? You are going down. Oh my God. I just heard him. Where is he? Are we going to win? We're going to win the game.

79
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:52,559
How did that happen? You know, I'll tell you how that happened. That's a spy. I'll tell you how that happened.

80
00:12:52,559 --> 00:13:01,360
They had a teleporter back here somewhere and they all were just coming to the front lines and nobody was back there anymore. That's ridiculous. Oh my God.

81
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:08,600
Well anyways, that's going to wrap up Face Camp Fortress 2 Mondays edition. Thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it guys.

82
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,779
And I'll see you guys all next time. And of course, take care everybody. Reety!
