1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:11,970
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with some more Hitman Absolu-

2
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:18,210
Whoa! Hitman Absolution. And this is episode two. This is the King of Chinatown.

3
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:24,289
And what are you cooking here, dude? There's nothing in this pot. You're not cooking anything.

4
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:33,340
You know what? I just like hammer punched him in the face. All right, I gotta restart.

5
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:39,979
All right. Time to, uh, to actually play the mission. Get the hell out of my way.

6
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:45,770
Get out of my face. This place is so crowded. How am I supposed to ever assassinate somebody here?

7
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,179
This is going to be like impossible. Where is the guy? Oh, he's over there.

8
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:57,320
Yeah, let's kill a guy that's like standing in the middle of the area. King of Chinatown. There he is.

9
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,899
Get out of the way! Get the- Get out of my face! These people are just blocking my path.

10
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:15,290
Uh, hello there, officer. Can I like come look at that guy? Nope. What? I was just

11
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:24,579
kidding. Spotted. It was just a joke. Cool down, man. Wow. What is that? Oh,

12
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:31,140
it makes some points of interest. I see. There's a lot of different ways to potentially do this,

13
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,140
probably. I can't believe I just lost 1,500 points just for going up there and like smiling.

14
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:44,200
Should I get a tattoo? A lot of people over here. This person. What's this person selling?

15
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,890
You got fish? Watch out. Let me like look at it. Oh, it looks good. Fresh fish. Now,

16
00:01:50,890 --> 00:02:00,650
get the hell away from me. Where should I even go? Oh, oh, oh, oh, there's like a- Well,

17
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:08,599
that's that guy's trail. Okay. Can I walk by this guy? Is he going to freak out? I don't think I

18
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:19,830
can walk by this guy. What's this? Sabotage? Hell yeah, sabotage. Oh, I can't believe that

19
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:25,370
guy didn't see me. How did this guy not see me just do that? Dude, you're an idiot. You say nice

20
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:33,689
shirt? What a prick. Look at the nice shirt to you. What is it, like 1984? This isn't like the 80s,

21
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:41,860
bro. Sneak up behind that guy. Trespassing, but he can't see me. He doesn't even know. Yes. Okay,

22
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:47,900
get that bottle. What the hell do I do? Are the lights off up here? Is anybody else up here? I

23
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:57,620
swear to God, I'm going to get myself murdered. No, there's nobody here. Keep out. An apartment

24
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:04,379
overlooking the square. FitzBirdy's description. Okay. A lot of places to hide. I'm kind of

25
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:15,139
afraid of this area. I guess I can go. Can I even open this door? Ooh. Oh, this is the guy's

26
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:29,289
apartment. It's... Oh, yes. I'm going to snipe the hell out of this guy. Where is he? Can I even go

27
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:36,060
in this window? I'm scared to go in it. There he is. Hold on. I need an escape route here, guys,

28
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:43,849
because if I shoot this guy, I don't want to get in the window. Someone's going to see me in this

29
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:48,840
window. It's going to be over. There's the guy right there. Can I shoot him from right here?

30
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:58,169
No, I got to be standing. Oh, man. I don't want to take the shot. Oh, I can't pull the trigger. I

31
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:04,819
can't do it. Oh, I can't do it. I can't do it. Oh, I got to do it. I got to do it like right now.

32
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:16,500
I got him. Didn't anybody see that? There's a guy coming. There's a guy coming. There's a guy

33
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,259
coming. He didn't see me. Oh, my God. There's a guy at the top of the stairs right there.

34
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:30,500
Look at... Look in the radar. Look in the radar. There's two people that are coming up here right

35
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:36,170
now. I am actually shaking. I'm like, oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. There he is.

36
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:57,060
Please don't open this. Please don't open this. Oh, should I get out? Oh, God. This is the most

37
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:05,019
terrifying thing ever. He's looking at me. Oh, get out of here. Get out of here. I'm freaking out

38
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:20,629
right now, guys. That was so terrifying. Am I in the clear? Cautious. Okay, I need to get out of

39
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:30,470
this closet. When this guy comes back in there, I'm killing him. I'm jumping out. Push him out the

40
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:38,459
damn window. Choke him out. Choke him out. Oh, that's the guy that talked a bunch of crap. I'm

41
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:43,319
breaking his neck. Remember this guy? This is the guy that said, oh, what do you like? What do you...

42
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:55,129
Nice shirt. Yeah, disguise. Can I bury this guy somewhere? There's two dudes right here. Come on,

43
00:05:55,129 --> 00:06:01,930
get in here. Get in here. This guy looks like an idiot. Oh, that's pretty morbid. Hey, I had to

44
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:09,930
break this guy's neck. He was an absolute prick. Oh, don't mind me. Just carry on. I gotta throw

45
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:15,610
that down. All right. Now, I'm this guy. I'm gonna walk out as this guy. All right. What's up? It's

46
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:24,870
just me. Oh, hi. Yeah, remember me? I just need backup. I need backup. Oh, my God. I'm actually

47
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:34,329
gonna get away with this, I think. Anybody else? They're looking for me out here. Hello, officers.

48
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:42,040
Good to see you. Nice to meet you. Wow, everyone's freaking out. I should get a pretty good score

49
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,160
for this, shouldn't I? Well, I did break that guy's neck. How do I get out of here? Oh, it's over

50
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:55,000
here. I want to just like sprint. That was terrifying, guys. That was ridiculous. When those

51
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,110
guys were like looking for me and they almost spotted me. Oh, I'm home free. This is like an exit,

52
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:20,139
I think. Yes. I did it. Oh, nice. And there it is. 36,000 points. Target kill, one. Non-target

53
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,060
casualty, one. Minus three. Ah, that's the guy. But that guy was a jerk, so he deserved it.

54
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:30,939
Three objectives complete or times three. Body hidden and headshot. Hell yeah. Nice.

55
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,899
But that's gonna wrap it up here, guys. If you missed episode one again, it'll be in the

56
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:40,060
description and probably an annotation on the screen in the beginning and end of this video.

57
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,259
So yeah, thank you so much for watching. Really do appreciate it. I'll see you all soon.

58
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,579
Take care, everybody. Stay tuned for episode three.
