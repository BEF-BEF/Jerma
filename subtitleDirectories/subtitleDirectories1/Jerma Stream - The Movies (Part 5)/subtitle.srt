1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:15,480
Hey, how are you? Hope you're doing good. I'm doing all right. I just had a chicken Caesar salad wrap.

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,160
Finished it up. The whole plate. Like a good boy. That means I get this Captain Crunch.

3
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,920
Happy Father's Day. Happy Father's Day to all you fathers out there. And I'm not a father,

4
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,840
so everyone saying happy Father's Day to me. I'm not. I don't have any children.

5
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:47,579
But if you do, Dad, Gerva is the father. You're our father. Well, thanks. Thank you.

6
00:00:48,539 --> 00:01:03,960
Thank you, kids. Thanks, kids. Yep. But what did you get me? Okay.

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,040
Did you do anything mean? What is that? What is that? Didn't get me anything.

8
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,079
Not going to... I mean, I looked out the window and I noticed

9
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:34,500
the lawn still ain't cut. Am I going to go do that? Or it's getting kind of tall.

10
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:47,370
It's getting a little tall. And last night, I just want to... Your mother was coming in with

11
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:53,530
the groceries and you playing that that cartoon game with the walls of the Minecraft

12
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,290
shooter, whatever it is, Fortnite. You didn't get up and help your mother with the

13
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:07,849
groceries. And I had to... Thank you, though, kids. Is this shit that your dad said?

14
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:20,199
Maybe in another time. Not this current time, though. Anyways, hello. Yes. Happy

15
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:25,719
Father's Day, though. What we're going to do, I'm going to block out a plan for you.

16
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:31,080
Are you ready for this plan? At the end of this week, I am not going to be here.

17
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:39,930
I mean, like physically not going to be here. I have some things going on. I am visiting some

18
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:48,120
family. And during that same time period, about five days or so, I'm going to be doing a lot

19
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,319
of work on a big stream. So I'm going to be spending a lot of time putting it together,

20
00:02:54,039 --> 00:03:00,729
getting it ready. And that's what I'm going to be doing. 50-50 family and like working on a

21
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:09,539
stream. So I will not be here for about five days. That was disgusting. I'm really sorry.

22
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:18,360
Another colonoscopy. No, no, no, no. That's the most disgusting sound ever.

23
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:24,939
This is why I can't be live. See, if this was a recording, I would have been like,

24
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:27,419
all right, whatever, that's here. And then I would have gotten in and I would have cut that

25
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:33,259
out. I would have just taken the razor tool and right where it went, cut that part of

26
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:38,699
the audio, cut that part of the audio at the end, delete, and then put like background noise

27
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:42,060
there. And you wouldn't even know. I did that a million times. You know, many times I fucking

28
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,819
sneezed on a video and just, it was gone. And then I manipulated the video to a point

29
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:55,580
where you didn't know I had sneezed on it. Anywho, today we're going to do the movies.

30
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,879
We're going to go back to the movies. Talked about it yesterday. It's been a long enough

31
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:06,780
time where I think it would be fun to go back in. And also not just about that,

32
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,180
just about that. But more importantly here, five community subs just came in from Derma

33
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:17,100
lied about the clown car. Thank you for the five community subs. Appreciate the five subs.

34
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:25,079
Derma lied about the clown car. But I'm going to give you the, let's break it down. So

35
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:30,439
today we're going to play the movies. I'm going to re-familiarize myself with the game

36
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:34,360
because it's been like two or three years. I don't really remember all the tools. We're

37
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,639
just going to go through the beginning of the game, maybe start a new studio, make

38
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:42,199
a few things, whatever, and relax and play and learn the game again, kind of. Now I

39
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:48,600
also have like a hundred fucking mods, like 40 characters, like 50 new sets, like hundreds,

40
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,160
like hundreds of props. I have tons of fucking mods. We're not going to use those today

41
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,009
because I, I need to, I want to like make sure I know what I'm doing and where we're

42
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:02,089
going. So there's going to be two movie streams. This one's going to be the

43
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:09,050
re-familiarize and make some movies. And the one after is going to be like the fuck you table

44
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:14,100
of movie streams. I don't want to give any spoilers as to some of these characters that

45
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:22,339
are in it, but I hope they all work. Also star and I are going to be playing deep rock

46
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:27,209
galactic at some point this week as well. So that's what's going to be happening for the

47
00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:31,290
remainder of this week. I'm going to play that dwarf game, whatever the hell it is.

48
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:36,420
So now that we've gone over that, you can understand what you can expect this week,

49
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:44,790
like fucking sick. Okay. Let's open up the movies. If you don't know the movies,

50
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:57,750
this is some of the best, most fun I think we've ever had on, on camera. I think I would say

51
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,839
gatekeeping your own channel.

52
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:15,129
Yeah. I was just like, yeah, that's what it is. Gatekeeping my own channel. Why am I doing that?

53
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:25,449
Let's go. Uh, you cannot hear anything, but you will be able to see. Well, actually never

54
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:33,990
mind. You can see things now. You remember this screen? It's been a while. So I remember a

55
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,829
little bit. I remember a little bit about the game. I remember like a few things that

56
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:41,240
are very important to know, but I don't think I need to do like the, I know how to like

57
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:47,050
move the camera and shit. If I need help, I can go do it. Right? We're going to do new

58
00:06:47,050 --> 00:07:01,959
game, uh, studio, poor productions. What's this? This is important. I need to make an actor. You

59
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:09,540
got to make directors and like, and cameramen and stuff. Oh yeah. Pop out your eyes. Productions.

60
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,459
No, no, no, no, no, no. We got, this is a different studio. That studio was liquidated.

61
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:18,629
That doesn't exist anymore. We, we had too many flops and too many bad decisions,

62
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:24,089
but they're getting, yeah. Get back. They're getting too close. Back up. Yes. I know. Hi.

63
00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:38,250
Excuse me. How about horse? What? No. How about, um, here we go. No, no, no. How about

64
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:51,050
chopped up? Uh, cut? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Leo incorporated,

65
00:07:51,050 --> 00:08:02,819
Leo P Pants productions. No, it's not going to be Leo P Pants. Uh, I don't know. Prime,

66
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:20,379
Prime Chuck productions. The name of your studio doesn't matter. It shows nobody.

67
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:39,019
P Pants limited. Bursting with laughter. Big chin productions. P Pants limited LLC.

68
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:45,580
P Pants limited limited liability company. No, that sucks. That's like too easy of a joke.

69
00:08:54,570 --> 00:09:02,649
P Pants liability. How do you, should it be P Pants liability? P Pants limited Leo liability,

70
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:27,779
limited Leo company. How about just P Pants liability? No, I'm not naming my company

71
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:48,779
machinima. It's fucking liquidated in like less than five years. Got it. P Pants liquidated

72
00:09:48,779 --> 00:10:01,159
company. Sounds pretty good to me. Name. No, that's my name. Okay. P Pants liquidated

73
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:11,799
is the name of the company. I don't have any actors though. Welcome to the dawn of the movie.

74
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:16,200
The same fucking thing happened last time I played this. The year is 1920 and your new studio's

75
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:23,480
success lies in your hands. You must guide it to greatness. You must create the biggest movie

76
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:30,360
and employ the most famous stars as you strive to reach the summit of the studio charts

77
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:37,000
and reap the rewards of victory. First build a thriving studio, hire wannabes,

78
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,679
and they're gonna have actors. Here comes the old content that'll get the big box rolling in

79
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:50,039
and clean up at the awards. Then with every award you win, with every success you enjoy,

80
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:57,720
your studio's reputation will grow. Soon stars from rival companies will flock to your studio

81
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,799
and you'll unlock new mods, scenes and sets to make your movies better than ever.

82
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:09,159
But once you unlock those mods, there's no going back. That's why you have to wait till the

83
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:17,000
next stream. That's once fucking Batman shows up and drop kicks R2-D2 through a glass pane.

84
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:23,509
We ain't doing the regular game again. Welcome to your new movie studio. Turn this shit up.

85
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:34,490
Okay, let me get a audio. Let's turn it up. That sounds a little bit better, don't you think?

86
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:41,190
All right, here's our lot. We have to make some stuff. Before you open the studio,

87
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:47,799
you'd better set up some of the essentials. I remember some of this. We need the box office,

88
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:52,600
right? Stage school, right? You can place the stage school anywhere by left clicking

89
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:58,120
at the desired location. Go ahead, give it a try. We've already done the regular game. I'm

90
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,759
only doing this because I just need to refamiliarize myself with the tools and the controls. I can't

91
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:07,240
just jump into sandbox mode because I'll just have no idea what I'm doing. It's been three

92
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,440
years since I did the same video in the same stream. Center it. What do you mean center it?

93
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:21,769
It's off center. It's always going to be off center. All right. To build the stage school,

94
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:26,409
you'll need to hire a builder at the staff office by the studio. This is the staff,

95
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:30,250
right? Oh, that's right. You got to go to the studio gate. Now click and hold down

96
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:35,289
the left mouse button briefly to pick them up. Yeah, you did. It's actually like janitors,

97
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:40,899
right? And stuff you have to actually create. Follow the sparkling stream and drop them in

98
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:47,299
the builders. Many janitors by left clicking. Great. Builders perform any building and

99
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:52,340
maintenance duties automatically so you can leave them to it. Fantastic. While the

100
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:56,340
stage school is being built, you can use this time to sort out the rest of the building,

101
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:02,100
which we need, uh, active studio, right? You need one janitor. No, you ever played a game

102
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:07,139
like this. You need like 30 janitors and you need to put them in patrols in tiny little

103
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:11,779
locations. Okay. Let's keep going. Okay. Now build a casting casting office, right?

104
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:16,580
You'll need this for assigning stars to your movies. You can rotate a building by holding

105
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:21,860
down the left mouse button and moving the mouse around in a circle. Try this now. Casting

106
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:27,139
office would be down here. P Pants, uh, liability company is, you know, we're going to be get,

107
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:35,750
make it clean. I'm thinking like, thinking like right here. Great. Now build a crew

108
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:44,600
facility. Yep. Crew facility. You need crew. Yep. Yep. Yep. We'll have this up here.

109
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:51,639
Yep. You need to janitor. Let's get a few builders actually.

110
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,710
Okay. You'll also need a set to shoot your movie on. The stage set will be perfect for

111
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:06,970
you. You're making a porn studio. I am not making a porn studio. Stage, right? Stage.

112
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:14,759
This is our first little baby set, but this is like 1920. Let's go. Let's go like over here.

113
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:20,470
Back here. Finally build a production office. You'll need this to release your movie.

114
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:25,500
Oh, you edit it right. I forgot about this. This is so much. I forgot. We're going to be here for a

115
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:39,379
while. Production office is going to be over here. I love this. You should put it over here,

116
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:44,500
right here. Excellent. Now you've got everything you need for your movie. You can look at

117
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,820
improving the studio environment. It's the perfect time to get the jump on the porn industry.

118
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:57,429
Imagine how rich you get if you invented porn. One of the keys to running a successful studio

119
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:02,149
is making sure your staff can easily find their way around. Okay. I guess.

120
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:07,669
Click on the landscaping button, then select the sparkling path icon.

121
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:12,549
Lay a path by left clicking and dragging out the shape on the ground.

122
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:16,549
I'm going to connect everything. The flashing connection points on your buildings.

123
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:25,029
Let's go this way. Did I fuck it up already? Yeah, I did. Don't worry about it though.

124
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:37,210
This is just for us to learn. Nothing else matters. I can go like this. All right.

125
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:46,309
This one also needs to be connected. There it is. And we need to our set as well.

126
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:55,669
This is one little baby line. All right. Excellent. I'm starting to remember. It's all

127
00:15:55,669 --> 00:16:00,870
coming back to me. Another important factor of having a great studio is to make sure your

128
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:06,389
staff have a nice working environment. Try placing down some ornaments. Trees,

129
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:09,029
bushes. They're going to make some nice stuff here. Okay. Now place some ornaments around

130
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:14,070
the studio. Left click to place an ornament and right click to get rid of the one you're

131
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:17,590
holding. Oh, let's go with how about one of these plates? Am I out of money? Try to use

132
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:22,389
a range of different ornaments as variety is the best way to keep the studio lot looking

133
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:33,029
attractive. Okay. Time to move on. Remember to place down more ornaments as the studio expands.

134
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:41,590
Corners. There we go. This is better. Look at that. There we go. Looks good. Looks good.

135
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:48,600
Excellent. The studio is now ready. Carry on improving things if you wish. And when

136
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:55,299
you're ready, you can open the studio. I think we're ready to open. This is the

137
00:16:55,299 --> 00:17:00,340
casting office. This is the stage school. This is the hire crew. You get a director

138
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:06,220
here. You create a crew. I know what I'm, I think I figured it out. Let's go. Are you

139
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:13,190
ready to open the studio? I am ready to open the studio. Congratulations. The studio is

140
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:20,170
officially open. Thank you. Now I need a director and we have to make an actor too.

141
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:25,450
You are tuned in to KMBS Wireless on a frequency of one to one point five.

142
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:30,809
And I am your wireless announcer, Mr. William Laker. Director, lead role, crew, extras.

143
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:38,650
Okay, let's do, so I need a couple actors. Who's this? Jeff Grant. I need to make my

144
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:49,140
own, don't I? Can I make my own? Is there a way I can do that, right? Would you put Jeff

145
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:57,690
Grant in here? All right, Jeff Grant is now an actor. There he is. Okay, time to make your

146
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:02,730
first movie. Director Leo. You won't get far without an actor and a director, so select a

147
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:10,250
couple of appropriate wannabes at the stage school. Appropriate wannabes. Uh, how about

148
00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:18,019
Jen Bolton? Now you just need a director. Bear in mind that a director won't appear in

149
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:22,259
front of the camera. That's it. Okay, time to move on. All right, so we've got Jen Bolton and

150
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:27,299
we got Jeff Grant. So we have, we're ready for, the world is ready for a comedy.

151
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:37,529
The Bag Boy. I remember this shit. Bag Boy script complete. Follow the stream to the casting

152
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:41,690
office where you can get your new stars to rehearse them. Okay, I remember this. We're

153
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:49,049
gonna bring in actors. Let's start by assigning your new director. Okay, let's go. You,

154
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:56,220
you're here. Cast your new actor. Bag, baggage boy is here. The stars have now started

155
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,220
rehearsing the script. This will help boost the final quality of the movie.

156
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:10,759
So now we need some crew, right? We need some crew. You guys can be fine. Available

157
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:15,720
crew will fill any required crew positions so you don't need to assign them. Look at

158
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,400
the movie to see how rehearsal is progressing. Rehearsal is doing pretty well. We can speed

159
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:30,539
it up. You make a script and then you put it into casting and then okay. Yep, I remember.

160
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:38,859
I'm just learning how to ride the bike. The script has finished. It's time to bring this

161
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:45,819
over to shoot it. Your movie is now shooting. Go to the stage set to follow its progress.

162
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:50,859
Now can't we do it on our own? Let's check what everyone is doing by looking at the cast

163
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:58,309
and crew information bubble on the movie. They're currently shooting. They're already

164
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:05,380
shooting. Oh wait, don't they tell you like that you don't have to like unlock that?

165
00:20:06,259 --> 00:20:08,950
I'm pretty sure I have to unlock that. They're running all the way over there.

166
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:17,480
The first movie always sucks. It's always just like hey this is how you learn how to play the

167
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,500
game. So they're heading for the set. There's only two people. Then he like lifts up barbells

168
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:42,680
or something. Get in there. Here they come. Oh yeah, it's an old camera. The first scene is now

169
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:47,559
being shot. You can see the overall movie progress in the movie's information bubbles.

170
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:58,009
Yeah, you try to lift the barbell. This is the first movie ever made. Scenes that are

171
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:03,690
still to be shot are displayed in the movie's shooting schedule bubble. Each scene shows which

172
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:13,220
set it will be shot on. Yes, we're currently in this is just three scenes shooting the first

173
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:18,900
one. Okay, now you can continue to follow the movie's progress. I didn't even do anything.

174
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:24,339
In preparation for your next movie, build the new set that has become available.

175
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:34,390
Cut his mic. Wild West Saloon. Put the sets back here. Okay, while the movie is shooting,

176
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:39,990
it's worth looking after the rest of the studio. Look around the studio for information icons and

177
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:48,660
the corresponding tips. Look for those things in the studio. I said we've already got

178
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:55,910
this is if you can find any job seekers or if you have any spare staff members try turning

179
00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:04,359
someone into a janitor. Yeah, here we go. Here's the janitor. Casey, you're a janitor.

180
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:10,819
Take care of the place. Okay, anything else that I'm going to need to remember besides the

181
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:15,910
right? This is okay. Movie player archive reviews, finance, right? Remember this part,

182
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:25,339
you put the movie over here. This is the crew. Here's actors and directors. I need to make

183
00:22:26,869 --> 00:22:31,029
some characters. When we get out of here, we do sandbox and we start to actually make

184
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:43,160
movies. I got to make a few people. All right, this one's done. Oh no, it's not. You're still

185
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:58,089
shooting the same scene. Why am I looking at the wall? And that's not me. Landscape and

186
00:22:58,089 --> 00:23:11,539
ornaments connected over here. Nope, straight ahead. All right, good. So why does the first

187
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:22,250
movie go? It's a damn shame this game is so hard to come by nowadays. This is one of the

188
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:29,700
best games ever made. That is true. Unfortunately, it is hard to come by. I wish they would

189
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:36,460
just re-release it somewhere, put it somewhere. I don't know why they don't do that. Who even

190
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:48,710
owns the rights to this now? Microsoft? Yeah, Microsoft. Yeah, this could use a GOG release.

191
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:53,690
All right, double left click on an empty set for a fly through that will show off its key

192
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:59,690
features. All right, shooting's done. But I want to take a look at it though.

193
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:05,299
Well, we are just going to watch it. Okay, release the movie. You don't need to...

194
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:13,180
whatever. All right, baggage boy is released. Script quality is awful. The movie's terrible.

195
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:23,450
We get to watch it. Here we go. It's time to watch the baggage boy. I guarantee you he just

196
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:29,539
picks up the dumbbell and he can't lift it and he hurts his back. Here we go. Let's

197
00:24:29,539 --> 00:25:37,349
take a look at that movie. Yep, that's it. That's the whole thing. What is this part?

198
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:47,430
I don't remember this part. Why am I getting like yelled at? It took 11 months to make this

199
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:58,549
shit. Wow, I didn't remember that. All events and characters in this movie are fictional.

200
00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:05,349
Anything similar to real people living or dead is a coincidence. Right, there we go.

201
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:13,609
No, I don't... we're not watching that again. Okay, that was the baggage boy.

202
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:21,640
Pretty good. The effective movie on your staff and studio. They're not that stressed

203
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:27,210
up but they made some money. It cost ten dollars. Was that... is that ten bucks?

204
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:38,200
Eleven bucks. That's not eleven thousand. Six months to make. It's blatantly obvious

205
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,240
that Jeff Grant doesn't have a great deal of comedy experience directed with a blatant

206
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,559
disregard for quality. Grant, I didn't make it. If I made it we would have people fucking

207
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:58,700
screaming. The movie makes money over the course of a couple years. Right.

208
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:07,339
This game is so fucking good. I miss it. I'm so glad... you know when... okay, here's the thing.

209
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,779
You know when you don't do something for so long and you come back and it's like brand

210
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:17,799
new again? That's how I feel right now. I feel like I'm... I'm glad I don't remember

211
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:22,279
much from like a couple years ago, whatever, two, three years ago. Oh, this is fantastic. I'm

212
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:26,839
so glad that I like don't remember any of this. Your studio's chart rating is based on the

213
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:31,480
movies you release, the stars you employ, and the overall status of your studio.

214
00:27:33,339 --> 00:27:39,819
The bigger your stars, the higher your studio rating. Alright, time for me to make one. I'm

215
00:27:39,819 --> 00:27:46,089
gonna make a little one. The better your movies, the higher your studio rating. It's not quite

216
00:27:46,089 --> 00:27:58,069
time to go into the sandbox mode yet. Let's click on the rosette. Old Rope Cinema,

217
00:27:58,069 --> 00:28:11,299
Pee Pants Liquid. These are the rival studios. Okay, movie charts. Okay, star charts and then

218
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:19,220
studios. Yeah, it just shows you how you're doing. Now that you have a movie out and some

219
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,380
money in the bank, it's time to take a closer look at your stars and staff. People in

220
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:29,059
weird costumes and stuff. Your employees need good sanitation, so place down some restrooms

221
00:28:29,059 --> 00:28:35,460
to improve your studio rating. Your employees need good catering provisions too. A snack van

222
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:41,990
will do for now. Great, this will raise not only your catering rating, but your overall

223
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:51,299
studio rating too. Happy stars make better movies. If you want a star to perform well

224
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:55,460
in a movie, you need to make sure they're happy. That's too convenient of a bathroom

225
00:28:55,539 --> 00:29:15,940
location. What do you mean? It's bad. So who the hell am I gonna make? I have to make

226
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:19,619
like a couple of directors, I gotta make some actors. I made like Glooman last time.

227
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:26,420
When the mood bar goes below the lower threshold line, it will glow red. This means a star is

228
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:32,259
very unhappy. You can't. You can only make like default characters. You can't make like

229
00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:38,980
huge noses. I could do Jax. One aspect of a star's mood is how they feel about their image.

230
00:29:39,619 --> 00:29:45,140
Try hovering over your stars to see how they feel. You have to work on like clothes and

231
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:53,990
stuff. Yeah, okay. One way to improve a star's image is to give them a makeover.

232
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:58,869
Give them a makeover. Remember, you can rotate. You can drop builders around the sides of the

233
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:08,019
building to speed up construction if you want. Use the arrows above the star icons to view your

234
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:15,059
other staff types. Staff icons can be used in the same way as star icons. You can drop

235
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:23,269
builders around the edges like orcs. Okay, speaking of builders, and where are they?

236
00:30:25,829 --> 00:30:36,309
Make Super Jax a director. I can't. I can't make Super Jax. How am I supposed to do that?

237
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,140
Yeah, I can do Adam Sandler. That's easy.

238
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:07,369
See it before it drives off on the real plan. The makeover department is built.

239
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:12,740
Pick up a star whose image you want to improve. Okay, let's go with um, let's go with Jeff

240
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:18,980
Grant. Okay, give this star a makeover. Go to the bathroom. Follow the guiding stream to

241
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:25,460
your new makeover. Go to the bathroom. The makeover department is built. No, no, no. Okay,

242
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:29,940
give this star a makeover. Drop a star in the makeover room to enter the makeover screen.

243
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:57,660
Okay, I can re, I can rename. Okay, this is the 1920s. How do I get, how do I take the

244
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:12,650
hat off? Oh, I forgot. This is the, this is the 1920s. Nobody never, nobody ever didn't

245
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:54,920
have a hat on. People like slept in their hats, didn't they? Okay, not bad. Those long,

246
00:32:54,920 --> 00:33:21,140
long ass sideburns. That's fine. That's fine. This is just temporary. This is temporary,

247
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:30,579
temporary, temporary. Or use the auto room if you don't mind what using the makeover

248
00:33:30,579 --> 00:33:36,420
screen is. No, I hate it. And gives you more control, but be careful not to choose something

249
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:47,660
that. Holy shit, he's about to lose his mind. Well, I guess I did to take his hair. Stars

250
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,660
are happy with their image. Somebody said, Hey, I'm going to do a makeover for you.

251
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:55,900
Oh, are you? Yeah, I'm actually just going to like cut your hair off and fuck your whole

252
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:06,180
head up and make you bald and then put you in underwear and make you leave. Okay. Great.

253
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:10,980
Remember to revisit the makeover department. If any stars are unhappy with their image,

254
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:15,460
I think I can remember mostly everything now until we, we get to like the more

255
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:19,539
intricate stuff with the timeline editor, but I think it'll just start to come back to me as

256
00:34:19,539 --> 00:34:23,619
I play. All right. Let's, let's just, let's see if I can make another movie.

257
00:34:23,619 --> 00:34:27,940
As you can imagine, the more successful your stars become, the more money they want.

258
00:34:33,269 --> 00:34:37,940
Play with mods. I am going to play with mods, just not tonight. I'm going to be doing

259
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:42,500
another movie stream where I literally throw up a bunch of dog shit into the boulders.

260
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:50,019
I have hundreds of files that have to be installed. I have probably a hundred and like

261
00:34:50,019 --> 00:34:57,219
25 different props and characters and costumes and shit. It's going to be out of control.

262
00:34:58,019 --> 00:35:02,340
Hover over one of your stars to see how they feel about their salary.

263
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:06,500
If you want to give a star a raise, take them to the production office.

264
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,960
Yeah, there's a blue screen. Yes. I'm going to be

265
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:15,000
giving you guys some footage to use if you want to.

266
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,500
All right. So let's hover into the production office.

267
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,340
Finance room. Here we go.

268
00:35:31,659 --> 00:35:33,260
There. Have a little bit more money.

269
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:38,460
Okay. I guess I'm all right with you cutting my hair off.

270
00:35:38,699 --> 00:35:42,460
Stars can become jealous of their colleagues, too, if treated unfairly.

271
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,760
All right. At some point, your stars will begin to get bored and will need something new to do.

272
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,800
Have a look at your star's information bubbles to see how bored they are.

273
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,440
If the boredom bar falls below the threshold line, a star will become very bored,

274
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,239
which will affect their mood. The bar will gradually go down when a star has no work.

275
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:09,429
The boredom bar.

276
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,849
You're fine. You're fine. Still making money.

277
00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:19,289
Sixty-one thousand bucks.

278
00:36:19,289 --> 00:36:22,489
Making movies is a good way to prevent stars from becoming bored.

279
00:36:22,489 --> 00:36:26,090
You've acquired another script, which can be found at the studio gates.

280
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,400
Here's our new script.

281
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:36,010
Remember to follow the guiding streams and read the information bubbles to see what you need to do.

282
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,369
Let's get you in the leading role.

283
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:43,050
This movie has some minor roles that you can fill with extras.

284
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:45,849
You can hire extras at the stage school.

285
00:36:45,849 --> 00:36:52,329
Okay. I think that's it. I think I know what I'm doing.

286
00:36:53,909 --> 00:36:56,469
I think it's time to actually start, like, the real game.

287
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,559
This movie has some minor roles that you can fill with extras.

288
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:03,880
You can hire extras at the stage school.

289
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,340
So we have to go back into sandbox.

290
00:37:09,909 --> 00:37:13,110
This movie has some minor roles that you can fill with extras.

291
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:16,469
You can hire extras at the stage school.

292
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:19,480
I think I'm pretty sure I got the right idea now.

293
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:24,280
I just needed to do that initial, like, tutorial to get back into the swing of things here.

294
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:28,699
I'm gonna save it just in case there's something I don't remember

295
00:37:28,699 --> 00:37:31,019
that I have to come back and remember and re-familiarize.

296
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:36,860
So I think that's good.

297
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:40,170
All right. Let's go and do the real one.

298
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,010
And that's, let's make, I gotta make characters first.

299
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,940
All right. I turned it down because it's very loud.

300
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:49,989
I have to go back to the main menu.

301
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,340
Okay. So, game.

302
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:04,730
There's sandbox, but I don't, I need, it's a, it's a different window,

303
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:05,929
isn't it, to make a new character?

304
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,500
I think I have to open a separate thing.

305
00:38:11,059 --> 00:38:17,139
Yeah, it's a, it's a different EXE.

306
00:38:17,139 --> 00:38:19,719
All right. Give me Zach.

307
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:20,519
Let's get that open.

308
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:22,710
Let's make the characters.

309
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:27,929
So who the fuck did, this is really important because whoever is in here,

310
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:34,940
this is like who we use for the whole game.

311
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,579
It's gotta be some, it's gotta be people who they'd like to have.

312
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:47,530
Let's get it open.

313
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,929
You guys can, I think you guys can see it, right?

314
00:38:50,489 --> 00:38:51,940
We should be able to.

315
00:38:54,809 --> 00:38:56,250
Okay. Star maker.

316
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:56,730
Here it is.

317
00:38:57,289 --> 00:39:02,969
Might have to run this in a different window.

318
00:39:02,969 --> 00:39:04,010
Hopefully it's not too loud.

319
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:08,869
Is it running in this?

320
00:39:08,869 --> 00:39:10,389
It is running in a separate window, isn't it?

321
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:12,699
All right. Here we go.

322
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:21,590
Hey, look. Hey, look at that.

323
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,500
Can you not see it?

324
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,460
Why not?

325
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:29,289
Come on, show it.

326
00:39:29,289 --> 00:39:30,570
Why can you not see it?

327
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:36,940
Why can you not see this?

328
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:40,739
Star maker.

329
00:39:40,739 --> 00:39:41,460
It's showing up here.

330
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:46,099
Well, this is dumb.

331
00:39:46,739 --> 00:39:50,150
I mean, it's clearly here.

332
00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:53,219
Let me try this.

333
00:39:54,019 --> 00:40:01,909
It's not technically a game though.

334
00:40:01,909 --> 00:40:07,619
Can you see it now?

335
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:12,900
That's irritating.

336
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,820
Ah, there's only, there's one more way I can get this to work

337
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,699
and it's I just hit the pole.

338
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:22,489
Just capture the whole, hold on.

339
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:23,130
Bear with me here.

340
00:40:23,769 --> 00:40:25,130
I don't know why it's not capturing this.

341
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:27,610
It's kind of annoying, but what the fuck just happened?

342
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,929
Why did I lose every window?

343
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:34,179
Why are computers so dumb?

344
00:40:34,179 --> 00:40:37,900
All right, well hold on.

345
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,699
This is important.

346
00:40:43,139 --> 00:40:45,780
Monitor capture is the only way this is going to work.

347
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:49,380
There we go.

348
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:55,190
Hey, look, it's a tiny little window,

349
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,309
but you can see it at least.

350
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:06,389
Boomer wallpaper.

351
00:41:06,389 --> 00:41:08,469
This has been the wallpaper for like a year.

352
00:41:08,469 --> 00:41:10,340
Yeah, so window capture didn't work.

353
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,300
Game capture didn't work.

354
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,179
Only display capture.

355
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:12,739
Let's go.

356
00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:13,380
Actor.

357
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:25,579
Let's go like this as well.

358
00:41:25,579 --> 00:41:27,340
Just to make it a little bit better for you.

359
00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:31,099
All right, so this is Jex.

360
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:36,389
All right, basic settings.

361
00:41:36,389 --> 00:41:42,260
Let's do, what is, we got to get a good base here.

362
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:47,639
That's not a bad base.

363
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,880
Jex is not that old.

364
00:41:58,869 --> 00:42:00,230
It's definitely not this guy.

365
00:42:03,179 --> 00:42:03,980
This one's not bad.

366
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:04,539
Hold on.

367
00:42:04,539 --> 00:42:05,099
No.

368
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:10,019
Why can I not go down here?

369
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:10,420
Looks.

370
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:10,980
Oh, here we go.

371
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,019
This is important.

372
00:42:12,019 --> 00:42:18,409
It's really good action.

373
00:42:18,409 --> 00:42:19,849
Not that great comedy.

374
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,420
Stress threshold.

375
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:29,980
Boredom.

376
00:42:31,929 --> 00:42:32,570
Food.

377
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:34,409
Definitely have actions full.

378
00:42:34,409 --> 00:42:35,269
Trimness.

379
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:39,690
All right, we can't have him be that good looking.

380
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:43,369
He's got to be kind of more sci-fi.

381
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:47,369
No, he had no comedy at all.

382
00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:49,050
Action, horror, split this up evenly.

383
00:42:51,019 --> 00:42:51,739
Boredom, drink.

384
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:53,340
He needs to drink all the time.

385
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,300
Stars, drink.

386
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:55,980
Addiction threshold.

387
00:42:56,539 --> 00:43:01,400
You don't have to be that trim.

388
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,159
How about chest size?

389
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,059
Actually, no, that is important.

390
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:10,260
All right, that's okay.

391
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:10,659
Horror.

392
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,739
He's like a little bit funny.

393
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:16,920
And then mood.

394
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:22,420
Hey, he's like...

395
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:25,690
But Jex is not even handsome.

396
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,559
He's not funny at all.

397
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:31,960
No, why would, I'm the funny one, okay?

398
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:45,139
I think that's all right.

399
00:43:47,619 --> 00:43:48,900
Base, eyebrows.

400
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:54,489
Oh, eye makeup, necessary.

401
00:43:54,489 --> 00:43:55,369
Facial hair, none.

402
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:59,139
Change the hairstyle.

403
00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:02,260
See if we can find Jex's hairstyle.

404
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:04,550
And that's...

405
00:44:07,429 --> 00:44:09,190
Anything like him at all.

406
00:44:10,789 --> 00:44:11,750
Owen Wilson.

407
00:44:30,019 --> 00:44:31,539
Okay, this is it.

408
00:44:31,539 --> 00:44:32,420
I like this one.

409
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:35,210
He-Man.

410
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:40,659
He-Man.

411
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:49,739
Lois Griffin.

412
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:55,619
No, it's not Lois.

413
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:56,820
Oh, it's a ponytail.

414
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:58,340
I gotta change that.

415
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,659
I think it's just gonna have to be this.

416
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,059
That's not Jex.

417
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:24,780
No, it isn't.

418
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:30,650
There we go, all right.

419
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,980
He's got a different fit.

420
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:35,539
Okay, that's...

421
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:47,980
I like it.

422
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:48,860
It's staying.

423
00:45:49,579 --> 00:46:00,230
This is oblivion Jex.

424
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:22,199
Here we go.

425
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:22,920
A little bit less.

426
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:32,550
Oh, this is teeth in or teeth out.

427
00:46:36,099 --> 00:46:36,900
All right.

428
00:46:41,269 --> 00:46:42,949
Down here we got jaw.

429
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:03,429
Not really that close, but I think close enough.

430
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:23,820
It's the fucking hair.

431
00:47:24,539 --> 00:47:29,269
I can't even see the ears anyways.

432
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:33,110
Looks good.

433
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:54,150
Huge head.

434
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:55,349
Turn on face cam.

435
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,099
No, he's not a fucking cone head.

436
00:48:00,099 --> 00:48:03,000
All right, hold on.

437
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,039
Let me go back to the hair.

438
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:05,800
The hair is just killing this.

439
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:19,400
He looks like an emo singer.

440
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:27,510
He's got a huge head.

441
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:32,860
His head's not that huge, is it?

442
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:40,150
This is John.

443
00:48:57,699 --> 00:48:59,380
E-emo John.

444
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:09,139
His head's too big.

445
00:49:09,139 --> 00:49:10,179
It looks ridiculous.

446
00:49:26,389 --> 00:49:27,590
All right, hold on.

447
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:29,050
This is...

448
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:29,530
I don't know.

449
00:49:40,969 --> 00:49:44,150
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

450
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:44,789
What just happened?

451
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:46,710
Okay.

452
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:47,190
No, what?

453
00:49:51,829 --> 00:49:53,429
Wait, how do I save this?

454
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:56,949
Is he saved?

455
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:05,559
Oh, save.

456
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:06,280
Okay.

457
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:13,579
Okay, save.

458
00:50:14,969 --> 00:50:15,289
Load.

459
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:18,099
Okay, so this is...

460
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:19,059
We can rename...

461
00:50:19,059 --> 00:50:22,579
We're gonna rename him.

462
00:50:22,579 --> 00:50:23,380
Oh, fuck this.

463
00:50:24,579 --> 00:50:26,260
I can't rename him.

464
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,139
Okay, it's all right.

465
00:50:29,139 --> 00:50:29,699
It's okay.

466
00:50:31,179 --> 00:50:32,460
I can rename him later.

467
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:37,960
Wait, could I?

468
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:42,300
Was there a rename?

469
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:59,429
No, I can do it in the change costume.

470
00:50:59,989 --> 00:51:08,570
Okay, create actor.

471
00:51:18,679 --> 00:51:19,320
Let's go...

472
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,119
This is me.

473
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:25,429
Let's get the hair right.

474
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:27,639
I'm actually gonna...

475
00:51:27,639 --> 00:51:29,159
I'm not doing like the bald fucking head.

476
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:31,269
This is...

477
00:51:31,269 --> 00:51:33,269
I'm gonna get my actual hair.

478
00:51:33,269 --> 00:51:34,150
I mean, that's pretty...

479
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:35,110
That's pretty close.

480
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:37,190
No, it's not, but whatever.

481
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:45,320
Looks fine.

482
00:51:57,349 --> 00:51:59,110
That's a little extreme.

483
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:17,059
Okay.

484
00:52:17,059 --> 00:52:19,219
My eyes are always like wide open.

485
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:34,300
My mouth is out a little.

486
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:36,519
I'm usually pretty happy.

487
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:42,550
This looks like Mark Zuckerberg.

488
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:53,260
Whatever.

489
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:57,880
That's like every image you've ever seen

490
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,480
of Mark Zuckerberg's face.

491
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:06,460
All right, pull the chin back.

492
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:11,619
I don't have that big of a chin.

493
00:53:11,619 --> 00:53:13,130
I kind of have a turkey neck.

494
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:20,940
Let's pull the cheeks in.

495
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:28,619
They're not that...

496
00:53:28,619 --> 00:53:29,980
They're shorter than that.

497
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:34,460
I got a big eyebrow bone.

498
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:43,619
It looks good.

499
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:54,119
I kind of have like a skinny head like that.

500
00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:54,679
Okay.

501
00:53:54,679 --> 00:53:55,320
All right.

502
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,820
I gotta change the eyes.

503
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:59,349
You have a...

504
00:53:59,349 --> 00:54:00,710
It's a small brain.

505
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:04,679
What do you mean small brain?

506
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:08,139
Change the hair.

507
00:54:08,139 --> 00:54:09,420
What's wrong with the hair?

508
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,340
That is the hair that I have right now.

509
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:19,619
What do you mean change the hair?

510
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:19,940
That is...

511
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:20,980
That is my hair.

512
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:21,619
My current...

513
00:54:21,619 --> 00:54:22,579
Right now, my hair.

514
00:54:23,579 --> 00:54:24,539
Oh, God.

515
00:54:24,539 --> 00:54:34,059
That's actually pretty...

516
00:54:34,059 --> 00:54:44,360
That's actually better.

517
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,639
I'm not gonna do this.

518
00:54:45,639 --> 00:54:47,800
Like this is just fucking nuts.

519
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,579
I'm not doing this one.

520
00:54:49,579 --> 00:54:51,019
Everyone's gonna want me to do this one.

521
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:54,170
But come on.

522
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:55,050
This is too easy.

523
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:56,489
This is so easy.

524
00:54:56,489 --> 00:55:09,190
This is like every wrestler from the 90s haircut.

525
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:10,230
Like I don't want to do...

526
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:11,590
I do this every time.

527
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:24,019
Do my...

528
00:55:24,019 --> 00:55:25,539
I'm gonna do my actual hair.

529
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:28,500
This is it.

530
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:43,500
Unless they have one of the other ones like when it's short.

531
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,219
It's not that.

532
00:55:46,679 --> 00:55:47,559
It's not that either.

533
00:55:47,559 --> 00:55:48,599
I don't have like the M.

534
00:55:57,690 --> 00:55:58,889
Can I change his name?

535
00:55:58,889 --> 00:55:59,449
I'm sure...

536
00:55:59,449 --> 00:56:01,369
Can I change his name to Mark Zuckerberg?

537
00:56:01,369 --> 00:56:02,090
This is not even me.

538
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:02,969
This is Mark Zuckerberg.

539
00:56:02,969 --> 00:56:04,969
We're gonna have Zuckerberg be in our movies.

540
00:56:04,969 --> 00:56:05,530
This is...

541
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:05,929
I don't care.

542
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:06,409
I'm done.

543
00:56:06,409 --> 00:56:06,969
This is gonna be...

544
00:56:06,969 --> 00:56:19,690
This is Mark Zuckerberg.

545
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:21,530
What color is his hair?

546
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:28,940
It's his red.

547
00:56:29,579 --> 00:56:31,019
Mark Zuckerberg has red hair.

548
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:44,630
Yeah, he has the facial expressions too.

549
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:45,829
His hair's not green.

550
00:56:56,869 --> 00:56:58,070
Yeah, it's like this.

551
00:56:58,070 --> 00:56:59,030
That's fine.

552
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:09,159
Okay, that looks good.

553
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:10,280
What the fuck?

554
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:11,800
Why is this...

555
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:12,840
This is...

556
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:13,559
I don't even want...

557
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:14,679
I want to change this.

558
00:57:17,989 --> 00:57:19,190
I swear to God.

559
00:57:19,909 --> 00:57:27,110
All right.

560
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,469
Can I make me know?

561
00:57:28,469 --> 00:57:29,510
Or should I make...

562
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:30,230
All right.

563
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:52,780
I just keep it like this.

564
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:55,579
Just do...

565
00:57:55,579 --> 00:57:56,139
That's it.

566
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,099
This is Adam Sandler.

567
00:57:59,179 --> 00:58:00,380
It's Bobby Hill.

568
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:01,719
No.

569
00:58:02,199 --> 00:58:03,320
I can't have like all these...

570
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:11,610
They all have the wrong name.

571
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:36,039
No, this is Adam Sandler.

572
00:58:36,039 --> 00:59:04,659
What do Adam Sandler's ears look like?

573
00:59:04,659 --> 00:59:05,219
Fix the hair?

574
00:59:05,219 --> 00:59:05,539
I will.

575
00:59:05,539 --> 00:59:05,780
I will.

576
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:06,260
Just hold on.

577
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:30,820
Hold on.

578
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:31,219
Okay.

579
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:37,400
No, I gotta read...

580
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,280
This is gonna be like...

581
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:42,789
I don't know.

582
00:59:42,789 --> 00:59:46,539
I'm like the Anvil.

583
00:59:52,489 --> 00:59:53,610
Anthony Anvil.

584
00:59:59,289 --> 01:00:01,059
Anvil Sandler.

585
01:00:01,059 --> 01:00:01,539
All right.

586
01:00:01,539 --> 01:00:02,739
Yeah, I like it.

587
01:00:02,739 --> 01:00:03,690
Good job.

588
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:04,329
Good work.

589
01:00:04,329 --> 01:00:10,360
Yeah, we can't...

590
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,920
We gotta like get rid of the fucking real people, man.

591
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,780
This is like Arthur Cube brain.

592
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:39,480
Look at that profile.

593
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:50,699
Okay, eyes.

594
01:00:50,699 --> 01:00:51,900
We're gonna change these eyes.

595
01:00:51,900 --> 01:01:06,889
Okay, this might be the best person.

596
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:13,820
It's somebody in a silicone mask.

597
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:17,800
That's what this is.

598
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:21,099
This is B.F. Bugleberry levels of person.

599
01:01:21,099 --> 01:01:23,179
This is a person in a silicone rubber mask.

600
01:01:51,139 --> 01:01:51,699
This is...

601
01:01:51,699 --> 01:01:52,420
Okay.

602
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:52,900
All right.

603
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:53,300
All right.

604
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:53,780
All right.

605
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:54,340
All right.

606
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:55,139
All right.

607
01:01:55,139 --> 01:01:56,789
I think that's good.

608
01:01:56,789 --> 01:02:11,349
Now, is the hair the right...

609
01:02:11,349 --> 01:02:12,070
Okay.

610
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:13,030
Which hair is this?

611
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:14,150
I think the hair is perfect.

612
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:24,039
I don't think I want to change anything.

613
01:02:24,039 --> 01:02:35,659
Oh, I forgot to do the stats.

614
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:06,500
Anvil.

615
01:03:11,989 --> 01:03:12,949
The Anvil.

616
01:03:12,949 --> 01:03:16,949
All right.

617
01:03:16,949 --> 01:03:18,980
That looks good.

618
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:20,420
Everything looks set from here.

619
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:20,980
I'm not...

620
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:33,179
The hair is, I think, perfect.

621
01:03:33,179 --> 01:03:33,500
All right.

622
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,500
Hopefully, I can change these names.

623
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:38,300
Otherwise, it's going to be a very odd...

624
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:39,579
A very odd world here.

625
01:03:43,139 --> 01:03:43,460
All right.

626
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:44,420
We'll make a couple more.

627
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:44,820
Let's do...

628
01:03:45,699 --> 01:03:48,679
I gotta get...

629
01:03:48,679 --> 01:03:49,079
Okay.

630
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:50,039
We keep making people,

631
01:03:50,039 --> 01:03:52,280
and then we make them look way different

632
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:53,079
than where they're named,

633
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:54,119
and then I have to rename them.

634
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:01,860
How about...

635
01:04:02,179 --> 01:04:02,579
Betty.

636
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:04,420
It could be anything.

637
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:05,780
Betty can be anything.

638
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:07,050
Could be anything.

639
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:45,340
Consistently just doing the people's eyebrow.

640
01:04:50,969 --> 01:04:56,099
Let's get down here.

641
01:04:56,099 --> 01:04:59,880
She looks drunk.

642
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:08,780
I don't know.

643
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:17,460
Betty could be anything.

644
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:18,820
Turning into a Simpsons character

645
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:20,099
is what's happening here.

646
01:05:20,099 --> 01:05:47,300
Too much...

647
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:48,579
That's too much skin.

648
01:05:48,579 --> 01:06:00,500
Betty the Brick.

649
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,059
Oh, I mean...

650
01:06:02,099 --> 01:06:03,219
Betty the Goldfish?

651
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:10,380
I can't even say it.

652
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:11,420
Nobody said...

653
01:06:12,139 --> 01:06:13,980
RuneScape NPC.

654
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:16,869
Well, I don't even play RuneScape.

655
01:06:16,869 --> 01:06:18,389
Why do I know what that looks like?

656
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:24,579
I don't even know what that means,

657
01:06:24,579 --> 01:06:25,699
and I know what it means.

658
01:06:26,699 --> 01:06:34,309
That's the odd thing.

659
01:06:34,309 --> 01:06:35,510
I can see it.

660
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:53,210
Betty RuneScape.

661
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:54,730
That's so fucking ridiculous.

662
01:06:57,639 --> 01:06:58,119
Okay.

663
01:06:58,119 --> 01:07:03,530
All right.

664
01:07:03,530 --> 01:07:03,929
Hair.

665
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:07,699
I don't know if I want to change the hair.

666
01:07:07,699 --> 01:07:21,130
All right.

667
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:22,730
This, weirdly enough, this is like...

668
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:34,500
This is like Dollar Store Daenerys Targaryen.

669
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:52,659
I think I like the RuneScape hair.

670
01:07:52,659 --> 01:07:58,409
All right.

671
01:07:58,409 --> 01:08:01,210
Where's the RuneScape NPC hair?

672
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:11,670
Where is it?

673
01:08:16,819 --> 01:08:17,539
Look at all this.

674
01:08:28,619 --> 01:08:30,300
Where is that hair?

675
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:32,180
It's very important.

676
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:32,899
That's not it.

677
01:08:32,899 --> 01:08:33,859
I lost it.

678
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:40,149
There it is.

679
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:58,359
This is going to be so stupid.

680
01:08:58,359 --> 01:09:07,739
Looks good.

681
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:13,510
No.

682
01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:14,710
No.

683
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:15,989
That's just the way it is.

684
01:09:17,050 --> 01:09:17,369
Okay.

685
01:09:17,369 --> 01:09:18,010
This is Betty.

686
01:09:23,619 --> 01:09:24,260
All right.

687
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:24,659
Uh...

688
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:25,859
Action.

689
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:26,340
Comedy.

690
01:09:26,899 --> 01:09:29,060
Let's just do a perfectly balanced...

691
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:46,949
All right.

692
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:47,430
That's good.

693
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:49,829
Yes.

694
01:09:49,829 --> 01:09:50,069
Yes.

695
01:09:50,069 --> 01:09:50,550
That's the thing.

696
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:50,869
Yes.

697
01:09:50,869 --> 01:09:51,189
Yes.

698
01:09:51,189 --> 01:09:51,590
Of course.

699
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:52,859
All right.

700
01:09:52,859 --> 01:09:53,180
Save it.

701
01:09:54,569 --> 01:09:54,970
Save.

702
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:57,609
All right.

703
01:09:57,609 --> 01:10:02,649
Now, let's do two more.

704
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:03,689
Actor.

705
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:06,760
This is now going to be...

706
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:18,579
Make Todd Howard.

707
01:10:19,819 --> 01:10:20,300
Todd.

708
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:20,619
Todd.

709
01:10:20,619 --> 01:10:21,020
Todd.

710
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:21,260
Todd.

711
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:21,579
Todd.

712
01:10:21,579 --> 01:10:21,979
Todd.

713
01:10:21,979 --> 01:10:22,300
Todd.

714
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:22,699
Todd.

715
01:10:22,699 --> 01:10:23,100
Todd.

716
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:23,500
Todd.

717
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:24,920
Todd.

718
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:25,319
Todd.

719
01:10:31,319 --> 01:10:32,840
Why is everybody like...

720
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:38,520
Why do you want Todd Howard?

721
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:39,960
How about just Howard?

722
01:10:39,960 --> 01:11:28,739
Okay.

723
01:11:28,739 --> 01:11:30,579
Todd Howard is not 38.

724
01:11:30,579 --> 01:11:32,340
He's like 47.

725
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:34,140
How old is Todd Howard?

726
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:35,659
That's 47?

727
01:11:35,659 --> 01:11:38,470
That looks way older than 47.

728
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:39,270
I'm close to the...

729
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:39,989
Hold on.

730
01:11:39,989 --> 01:11:50,460
That's not how old people look when they're 42.

731
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:55,289
Am I going to just go down a straight 90-degree edge

732
01:11:55,289 --> 01:12:02,359
in like the next three years?

733
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:03,000
No.

734
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:03,560
No, I'm not.

735
01:12:22,569 --> 01:12:23,289
Okay.

736
01:12:23,289 --> 01:12:23,930
I think we're good.

737
01:12:24,729 --> 01:12:42,810
Like, this could be the person that you want it to be,

738
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:44,329
but that's not who this is.

739
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:55,659
It's not.

740
01:12:56,380 --> 01:13:15,100
All right.

741
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:15,899
In the middle is fine.

742
01:13:16,859 --> 01:13:32,789
It kind of looks like me.

743
01:13:32,789 --> 01:13:33,430
Weird.

744
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:36,010
I'm just starting to really actually look like me.

745
01:13:36,649 --> 01:13:55,579
This is me.

746
01:14:05,579 --> 01:14:07,819
That's looking a little weird, isn't it?

747
01:14:07,819 --> 01:14:09,020
At least in my opinion.

748
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:28,569
It's like Disney animated version me.

749
01:14:28,569 --> 01:14:34,260
Go like this.

750
01:14:38,069 --> 01:14:40,229
Or like face scan me.

751
01:14:40,229 --> 01:14:43,779
What about the hair?

752
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:45,939
Hopefully I can rename all these people.

753
01:14:45,939 --> 01:15:13,989
Otherwise, this is going to be a joke.

754
01:15:13,989 --> 01:15:14,550
Maybe not.

755
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:21,560
Do I not even know what I look like?

756
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:27,619
2012, Jerma.

757
01:15:27,619 --> 01:15:28,180
It could be.

758
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:47,079
This is like good boy, Jerma.

759
01:15:47,079 --> 01:15:47,640
Yeah, this is...

760
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:49,720
Okay, I kind of like good boy.

761
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:53,979
This is like...

762
01:15:55,989 --> 01:15:58,149
How many different good boys are there?

763
01:15:58,149 --> 01:16:01,510
Is there another version?

764
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:04,979
This is pretty fucking close.

765
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:20,859
Should I do no country for old men, Jerma?

766
01:16:20,859 --> 01:16:33,659
These are all so many different versions of me.

767
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:35,020
I gotta...

768
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:37,939
Hopefully, to God, I can rename them.

769
01:16:37,939 --> 01:16:40,340
I think I like missed a good boy.

770
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:44,260
Where is it?

771
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:54,710
Hairy fucking neck.

772
01:16:54,710 --> 01:17:17,460
Okay, that looks good.

773
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:18,579
I'm so stressed.

774
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:36,699
All right, looks good.

775
01:17:36,699 --> 01:17:41,850
All right, one more.

776
01:17:42,569 --> 01:17:44,569
Who do we even have?

777
01:17:44,569 --> 01:17:48,760
We have Andrew the Anvil.

778
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:49,399
We have...

779
01:17:49,399 --> 01:17:50,949
Who's that supposed to be?

780
01:17:50,949 --> 01:17:53,510
Mark Zuckerberg?

781
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:54,010
We have...

782
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:59,239
John Howard.

783
01:17:59,239 --> 01:18:00,840
These are all so wrong.

784
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:01,640
I can't change them.

785
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:02,039
It's going to be...

786
01:18:02,039 --> 01:18:12,149
We're going to be fucked.

787
01:18:12,149 --> 01:18:13,029
All right, this is it.

788
01:18:13,029 --> 01:18:38,600
Give me like...

789
01:18:38,600 --> 01:19:05,479
No, there we go.

790
01:19:05,479 --> 01:19:06,199
65.

791
01:19:06,199 --> 01:19:07,479
You look like 100.

792
01:19:07,479 --> 01:19:18,390
All right, that's fine.

793
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:19,029
All right, last one.

794
01:19:19,029 --> 01:19:19,670
Here we go.

795
01:19:19,670 --> 01:19:36,420
Wait, I need hair.

796
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:55,000
Give him a long nose.

797
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:57,239
Why would he have a long nose?

798
01:20:00,489 --> 01:20:01,130
Not bad.

799
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:40,739
I don't understand the teeth part.

800
01:20:40,739 --> 01:20:42,180
Not bad so far.

801
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:49,590
Pop the cheeks out a little bit.

802
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:50,630
Ears are fine.

803
01:20:50,630 --> 01:21:00,229
What's going on with his mouth?

804
01:21:00,229 --> 01:21:01,350
I don't know what is happening

805
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:02,949
with his mouth here, but whatever.

806
01:21:02,949 --> 01:21:19,239
Looks good.

807
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:24,199
Give him a big nose.

808
01:21:24,199 --> 01:21:32,409
No, I'm not going to give...

809
01:21:32,409 --> 01:21:36,170
No, everybody doesn't need a big fucking honker.

810
01:21:56,180 --> 01:21:56,899
I like him.

811
01:21:56,899 --> 01:22:09,750
Okay, stats.

812
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:10,069
Hair.

813
01:22:10,069 --> 01:22:13,340
Let me just make sure.

814
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:14,140
Much better.

815
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:25,079
Much better.

816
01:22:25,079 --> 01:22:26,630
Okay.

817
01:22:26,630 --> 01:22:27,350
All right, stats.

818
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:33,140
Let's do pretty balanced.

819
01:22:33,140 --> 01:22:56,859
I kind of like this more.

820
01:22:56,859 --> 01:22:58,939
Oh shit, here comes the police.

821
01:22:58,939 --> 01:23:05,340
Look at all this neck hair.

822
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:10,420
Yeah, I don't know why that's there.

823
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:11,060
That's good.

824
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:23,590
Should we have him like with a mustache?

825
01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:35,350
How about a beard?

826
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:42,539
I don't hate this.

827
01:23:48,869 --> 01:23:58,300
Why is this Leo P pants?

828
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:01,850
No, clean shave is fine.

829
01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:04,710
All right, it's time to make the studio.

830
01:24:04,710 --> 01:24:06,489
It's time to play the game.

831
01:24:06,489 --> 01:24:14,310
I'm ready, but hold on.

832
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:16,010
Wait, wait, wait.

833
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:18,380
Leo Howard, which is me.

834
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:20,810
Betty, which is Betty.

835
01:24:20,810 --> 01:24:24,760
Adam Sandliff, which is Adam Anvil.

836
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:29,180
Jeremy is actually Zuckerberg.

837
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:31,180
And then Jax is actually John.

838
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:31,819
We need to make...

839
01:24:31,819 --> 01:24:32,619
Hold on.

840
01:24:32,619 --> 01:24:34,250
We actually have to make a Jax.

841
01:24:35,050 --> 01:24:36,010
This is actually...

842
01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:37,130
This is the real Jax now.

843
01:24:37,130 --> 01:24:58,949
Is it 18?

844
01:24:58,949 --> 01:25:00,310
I don't think this person is 18.

845
01:25:27,130 --> 01:25:28,489
Can I see some Jax's in the chat, please?

846
01:25:28,489 --> 01:25:30,010
So I can get a good reference here.

847
01:25:30,010 --> 01:25:44,760
This needs to be like a little sweet.

848
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:46,520
Like this one here.

849
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:57,560
No, different one.

850
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:59,159
This is just Fred from Scooby-Doo.

851
01:25:59,159 --> 01:26:11,579
That's not who I'm trying to make here.

852
01:26:12,539 --> 01:26:14,140
I think I want it to be this.

853
01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:28,390
I think this just is what it's going to be.

854
01:26:28,390 --> 01:26:30,149
This is so ugly.

855
01:26:30,149 --> 01:26:30,630
What do you mean?

856
01:26:31,350 --> 01:26:36,199
Did you see the last five characters

857
01:26:36,199 --> 01:26:37,800
that I made in the game?

858
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:51,829
This is close.

859
01:26:57,779 --> 01:27:13,270
I mean, he's going to have a huge jaw.

860
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:22,579
Let's do the jaw first.

861
01:27:22,579 --> 01:27:51,210
I'm going to pull the cheeks in here.

862
01:27:51,210 --> 01:28:14,300
All right, looks good.

863
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:25,979
That makes him look bogged enough.

864
01:29:02,979 --> 01:29:04,659
This doctor's strange.

865
01:29:04,659 --> 01:29:05,539
This is the doctor...

866
01:29:05,539 --> 01:29:07,460
Okay, cover the screen with your hand.

867
01:29:07,979 --> 01:29:11,220
I'm making Benedict...

868
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:12,100
What's his name?

869
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:22,390
No, not Benedict Arnold.

870
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:25,380
There we go.

871
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:29,989
Nice.

872
01:29:29,989 --> 01:29:31,510
Just constantly fucking squinting.

873
01:29:31,510 --> 01:29:34,100
Just constantly.

874
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:34,899
I'm a pro.

875
01:29:34,899 --> 01:29:47,260
Okay.

876
01:29:47,260 --> 01:29:50,010
I need to bring in the cheeks.

877
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:51,369
I wish I could bring these cheeks in.

878
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:11,979
This is so ugly.

879
01:30:11,979 --> 01:30:13,180
Somebody in the chat just says,

880
01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:15,100
this is so ugly.

881
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:16,380
Please don't do that.

882
01:30:52,569 --> 01:30:53,689
I kind of hate this.

883
01:30:53,689 --> 01:30:55,609
But at the same time, I kind of like it.

884
01:30:55,609 --> 01:31:12,779
All right, that's it.

885
01:31:12,779 --> 01:31:13,659
No more characters.

886
01:31:13,659 --> 01:31:14,060
Let's go.

887
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:25,020
Nothing else matters.

888
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:40,939
This is Matt Damon.

889
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:45,319
Oh, wait a minute.

890
01:31:45,319 --> 01:31:46,119
Maybe it'll tell me...

891
01:31:46,119 --> 01:31:48,520
Oh, hey, you can't use that name.

892
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:57,220
All right, we're ready to go.

893
01:31:58,819 --> 01:32:00,500
So many Jeremy's that...

894
01:32:01,539 --> 01:32:03,220
Don't worry, they're going to be replaced.

895
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:14,489
All right, done.

896
01:32:14,489 --> 01:32:18,199
They're all Jeremy.

897
01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:19,159
And don't worry, we're going to get...

898
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:21,159
I don't want all created characters

899
01:32:21,159 --> 01:32:23,000
because there's going to be other characters

900
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,039
that come up through the rankings

901
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:26,619
that we think are cool.

902
01:32:26,619 --> 01:32:29,340
So everybody's done.

903
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:38,420
Let's go.

904
01:32:38,420 --> 01:32:43,670
I think I can just close this, right?

905
01:32:48,149 --> 01:32:48,869
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

906
01:32:49,590 --> 01:32:50,949
So I don't think...

907
01:32:50,949 --> 01:32:52,949
Where do you pull those people up from?

908
01:32:53,590 --> 01:33:04,649
I don't know.

909
01:33:04,649 --> 01:33:05,850
Let me just reopen the game.

910
01:33:07,579 --> 01:33:08,220
I got the...

911
01:33:08,220 --> 01:33:09,500
Yeah, I have a default background.

912
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:09,979
It's all right.

913
01:33:10,699 --> 01:33:21,060
What do you want me to have in my background?

914
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:24,970
What would you rather me have?

915
01:33:25,529 --> 01:33:37,420
All right, let's go.

916
01:33:39,289 --> 01:33:42,890
Time to create actual pee pants liquidated.

917
01:33:53,430 --> 01:33:54,149
All right, game.

918
01:33:55,659 --> 01:33:56,779
Sandbox.

919
01:33:56,779 --> 01:34:02,760
It's time.

920
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:04,039
Game starts in...

921
01:34:05,399 --> 01:34:07,079
1950 is fine.

922
01:34:07,079 --> 01:34:08,119
I get $100 million.

923
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:15,079
The building's constructed instantly.

924
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,199
Buildings don't decay.

925
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:24,380
Start with the studio a lot already.

926
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:26,140
So we don't have to go through all that.

927
01:34:26,140 --> 01:34:30,869
Take the money and run.

928
01:34:30,869 --> 01:34:32,229
Just create it and then leave.

929
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:35,819
All right, here we go.

930
01:34:38,149 --> 01:34:39,029
Instant movie making.

931
01:34:39,029 --> 01:34:39,750
I forget if that's...

932
01:34:41,079 --> 01:34:42,600
I think, yeah, they just get shot

933
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:43,800
and we can edit them.

934
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:46,520
Yeah, there's no audio because I have it turned off

935
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:48,199
because it's really loud in the menu.

936
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:51,720
Stars don't misbehave.

937
01:34:52,279 --> 01:34:53,000
That's fine.

938
01:34:55,939 --> 01:34:56,899
Buildings don't decay.

939
01:34:57,619 --> 01:34:58,869
Here we go.

940
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:03,750
Game starts in 1950 so gives us some opportunity.

941
01:35:04,949 --> 01:35:09,029
$100 million in 1950 is like $100 billion now.

942
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:11,399
Let's go.

943
01:35:11,399 --> 01:35:20,859
Pee pants.

944
01:35:21,659 --> 01:35:25,850
Pee pants liquidated.

945
01:35:25,850 --> 01:35:28,180
Where is it?

946
01:35:28,819 --> 01:35:35,460
And I'm Jeremy.

947
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:35,859
That's me.

948
01:35:39,899 --> 01:35:40,380
Let's go.

949
01:35:42,729 --> 01:35:49,449
Time to make a movie.

950
01:35:49,449 --> 01:35:51,210
So we need to have...

951
01:35:51,210 --> 01:35:52,729
Who's going to be the director?

952
01:35:52,729 --> 01:35:56,069
And how do we bring people in?

953
01:35:56,069 --> 01:36:02,579
How do we load characters in?

954
01:36:02,579 --> 01:36:03,779
Are they just going to be in the game?

955
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:10,250
I'm not sure.

956
01:36:10,810 --> 01:36:11,850
Did I even make anybody?

957
01:36:22,119 --> 01:36:22,840
Yeah, where's like...

958
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:24,680
Is there like an import character feature?

959
01:36:25,479 --> 01:36:26,680
Create, Builder, Fire.

960
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:27,079
Hold on.

961
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:29,399
Release.

962
01:36:31,180 --> 01:36:31,420
Bar.

963
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:35,399
Import star.

964
01:36:35,399 --> 01:36:35,800
Here we go.

965
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:36,039
Okay.

966
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:38,119
So I think we just have to drag

967
01:36:38,119 --> 01:36:39,720
like somebody over here, right?

968
01:36:40,739 --> 01:36:41,140
Yeah.

969
01:36:41,140 --> 01:36:41,460
All right.

970
01:36:42,409 --> 01:36:43,850
Import star as director.

971
01:36:43,850 --> 01:36:45,050
Okay, so let's bring...

972
01:36:45,050 --> 01:36:49,140
I got to rename them though.

973
01:36:49,140 --> 01:36:49,779
This Jex.

974
01:36:50,970 --> 01:36:51,449
All right, Jex.

975
01:36:51,449 --> 01:36:52,409
We're going to do a makeover.

976
01:36:53,210 --> 01:36:54,250
You are just Jex.

977
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:54,729
That's fine.

978
01:36:55,449 --> 01:36:59,159
Bring in Leo.

979
01:37:02,439 --> 01:37:02,840
Bring in...

980
01:37:03,479 --> 01:37:03,880
I don't...

981
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:04,279
Howard?

982
01:37:06,630 --> 01:37:07,670
But who's going to direct?

983
01:37:09,460 --> 01:37:09,859
Betty.

984
01:37:15,340 --> 01:37:18,060
Should I just make this like Zuckerberg?

985
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:20,140
I'm just going to make this the director.

986
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:28,920
Okay, these are all everyone's waiting.

987
01:37:30,229 --> 01:37:31,430
Make me the director.

988
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:36,439
Oh, I can't have any more actors.

989
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:38,279
Oh, shit.

990
01:37:39,770 --> 01:37:40,569
Who do we fire?

991
01:37:41,770 --> 01:37:43,289
Who's the worst out of all these?

992
01:37:46,090 --> 01:37:47,369
Who's the worst actor?

993
01:37:50,420 --> 01:37:51,460
No, Betty is staying.

994
01:37:52,329 --> 01:37:53,130
Is it Howard?

995
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:57,159
I think Howard just has to be...

996
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:59,479
Howard just has to be the director.

997
01:38:03,979 --> 01:38:04,779
Howard sucks.

998
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:09,130
All right.

999
01:38:09,130 --> 01:38:10,010
Howard's director.

1000
01:38:10,649 --> 01:38:16,140
Are they all directors?

1001
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:16,380
No.

1002
01:38:17,020 --> 01:38:18,710
No, they're not.

1003
01:38:18,710 --> 01:38:20,390
Okay, I can't have any more people.

1004
01:38:21,189 --> 01:38:24,279
Who am I missing?

1005
01:38:24,279 --> 01:38:27,079
I don't care if I'm missing like the emo John.

1006
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:29,859
All right, so let's make a set.

1007
01:38:31,619 --> 01:38:32,579
Let's get a...

1008
01:38:32,579 --> 01:38:34,020
Let's do like a movie.

1009
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:34,500
Let me just...

1010
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:36,500
I got to see if I remember how the fuck to even do all this shit.

1011
01:38:38,710 --> 01:38:40,390
Here, a bunch of janitors.

1012
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:49,460
That's the most jan...

1013
01:38:49,460 --> 01:38:50,579
I can't have any more janitors.

1014
01:38:51,909 --> 01:38:52,710
So let's...

1015
01:38:52,710 --> 01:38:53,590
It's script, right?

1016
01:38:54,229 --> 01:38:56,329
Who is the script house?

1017
01:38:56,329 --> 01:38:57,130
Casting office.

1018
01:38:58,090 --> 01:38:59,369
Begin casting crew.

1019
01:38:59,369 --> 01:38:59,770
Shoot it.

1020
01:38:59,770 --> 01:39:01,210
I need the script office.

1021
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:03,689
Make some crew.

1022
01:39:05,609 --> 01:39:10,859
And let's also make some extras.

1023
01:39:12,470 --> 01:39:15,909
Can I...

1024
01:39:15,909 --> 01:39:16,550
Can I not make...

1025
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:18,069
How many extras?

1026
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:20,840
Oh, right, right, right.

1027
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:21,079
Okay.

1028
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:22,979
Is this it?

1029
01:39:23,619 --> 01:39:25,140
This is the makeover department.

1030
01:39:25,140 --> 01:39:25,939
This is the trailer.

1031
01:39:26,899 --> 01:39:28,619
Give us John.

1032
01:39:28,619 --> 01:39:30,220
Well, somebody has to go.

1033
01:39:30,220 --> 01:39:31,979
Somebody has to be fired completely.

1034
01:39:32,619 --> 01:39:38,060
Custom script building.

1035
01:39:38,060 --> 01:39:40,060
But isn't that in a certain office?

1036
01:39:41,180 --> 01:39:41,739
Script office.

1037
01:39:41,739 --> 01:39:42,220
Here we go.

1038
01:39:42,220 --> 01:39:42,460
Okay.

1039
01:39:44,550 --> 01:39:46,069
So now I want to do...

1040
01:39:46,069 --> 01:39:47,670
I don't know what that means either.

1041
01:39:47,670 --> 01:39:50,779
Oh, is this mainstream pan movie making?

1042
01:39:51,420 --> 01:39:52,140
No, no, no, no, no.

1043
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:53,340
I need to grab a...

1044
01:39:54,140 --> 01:39:56,220
I got to start making a movie and then put it over here.

1045
01:40:02,869 --> 01:40:03,750
My god damn it.

1046
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:04,310
This is like just...

1047
01:40:05,109 --> 01:40:11,399
I got to bring you to over here, right?

1048
01:40:12,279 --> 01:40:13,479
I need to make a script.

1049
01:40:13,479 --> 01:40:15,079
But how do I make a script?

1050
01:40:17,319 --> 01:40:18,840
Don't I need like a screenwriter?

1051
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:20,359
How about just like let's do comedy.

1052
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:24,920
And then script.

1053
01:40:28,859 --> 01:40:31,319
How do I like edit this?

1054
01:40:32,119 --> 01:40:37,819
This thing is called alpha male.

1055
01:40:38,539 --> 01:40:46,359
This is where the tutorial would have been better.

1056
01:40:46,359 --> 01:40:47,640
Should remember how to do all this.

1057
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:48,920
You bring this somewhere, don't you?

1058
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:51,689
Custom script building.

1059
01:40:52,409 --> 01:40:53,800
Is that in a separate...

1060
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:55,560
Is that a different studio building?

1061
01:40:56,439 --> 01:40:57,350
Oh, it's a...

1062
01:40:57,350 --> 01:40:58,470
Yeah, it's not even here.

1063
01:40:58,470 --> 01:40:58,970
Okay.

1064
01:41:00,970 --> 01:41:04,739
How can I put it?

1065
01:41:12,069 --> 01:41:13,029
Custom script writing.

1066
01:41:13,029 --> 01:41:13,430
This is it.

1067
01:41:13,430 --> 01:41:13,750
All right.

1068
01:41:13,750 --> 01:41:14,789
Advanced movie maker.

1069
01:41:14,789 --> 01:41:15,350
This is it.

1070
01:41:15,350 --> 01:41:15,850
Okay.

1071
01:41:18,020 --> 01:41:18,899
So sorry, Howard.

1072
01:41:18,899 --> 01:41:19,939
You're not happy about this.

1073
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:22,020
So, you know, just stop doing it.

1074
01:41:23,079 --> 01:41:24,279
Just put this in the can.

1075
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:28,060
Well, you're just going to do it anyway, so it don't matter.

1076
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:30,680
All right, here we go.

1077
01:41:33,079 --> 01:41:35,640
Welcome to the advanced movie maker.

1078
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:38,119
The powerful yet easy to use tool

1079
01:41:38,119 --> 01:41:41,399
that lets you create your very own movie masterpieces.

1080
01:41:42,119 --> 01:41:43,800
The longer your movie is,

1081
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:46,760
the diversity and quality of its sets and scenes

1082
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:50,600
and the more lead roles, extras, and costume changes it has,

1083
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:51,640
the better it'll be.

1084
01:41:52,359 --> 01:41:55,000
However, the quality of your script writing facilities

1085
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,439
in your studio lot

1086
01:41:56,439 --> 01:41:59,560
will determine the maximum possible quality of your movie.

1087
01:42:03,460 --> 01:42:04,500
All right, here we go.

1088
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:06,140
Let me see if I remember how to do this.

1089
01:42:17,930 --> 01:42:19,930
Making an action movie, lead role.

1090
01:42:19,930 --> 01:42:23,460
We're going to have, let's have Leo.

1091
01:42:24,180 --> 01:42:28,890
Let's have Jax be supporting, just to see.

1092
01:42:29,689 --> 01:42:31,449
And then Adam Salem also supporting.

1093
01:42:34,710 --> 01:42:39,130
Leo as, this is all just to make sure

1094
01:42:39,130 --> 01:42:40,170
I remember how to do all this.

1095
01:42:40,890 --> 01:42:47,670
You can stay as Kurt.

1096
01:42:47,670 --> 01:42:48,229
That's fine.

1097
01:42:48,229 --> 01:42:49,189
And you can stay as Will.

1098
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:51,239
Structure.

1099
01:42:51,239 --> 01:42:52,359
This is where we want it to be.

1100
01:42:54,409 --> 01:42:55,609
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1101
01:42:56,939 --> 01:42:57,659
Detailed, right?

1102
01:42:57,659 --> 01:43:01,579
Freeform, trying to remember.

1103
01:43:01,579 --> 01:43:03,579
If it was, I think it's freeform.

1104
01:43:03,579 --> 01:43:08,010
It's been so fucking long.

1105
01:43:09,859 --> 01:43:10,579
Was it freeform?

1106
01:43:10,579 --> 01:43:12,100
Yeah, freeform that isn't based on the Hollywood.

1107
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:12,659
Yeah, that's fine.

1108
01:43:13,859 --> 01:43:14,420
All right, here we go.

1109
01:43:15,590 --> 01:43:18,710
So we're going to start with,

1110
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:23,380
yeah, you get to pick the different starting areas.

1111
01:43:23,380 --> 01:43:24,420
Let's just go to the bathroom.

1112
01:43:27,930 --> 01:43:29,369
Okay, this is where it begins.

1113
01:43:40,119 --> 01:43:41,640
Why are there zombies in here already?

1114
01:43:42,279 --> 01:43:46,760
Okay, so who's carrying who here?

1115
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:50,899
Wait, why are you carrying him?

1116
01:43:51,460 --> 01:43:56,619
Oh, that's Jax.

1117
01:43:56,619 --> 01:43:57,100
That's okay.

1118
01:43:58,699 --> 01:43:59,579
He looks different.

1119
01:44:00,380 --> 01:44:01,979
Why are there people in here like this?

1120
01:44:02,619 --> 01:44:05,590
You don't even need to be in this bathroom.

1121
01:44:05,590 --> 01:44:10,789
Okay, so this is the, let's go in here.

1122
01:44:10,789 --> 01:44:11,829
Let me just see.

1123
01:44:11,829 --> 01:44:14,840
Preparation into the bath.

1124
01:44:15,399 --> 01:44:19,100
All right, let's just have you get in the bath.

1125
01:44:19,659 --> 01:44:24,520
This is, no, I'm not a porn director.

1126
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:26,359
Okay, getting in the bath.

1127
01:44:26,359 --> 01:44:27,720
I want to put the camera.

1128
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:30,500
We could have a change of camera.

1129
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:31,380
Movie view, there we go.

1130
01:44:31,939 --> 01:44:39,430
All right, so that's Jax getting in the bath.

1131
01:44:41,829 --> 01:44:44,869
Down here we add scene, add a scene down here.

1132
01:44:46,859 --> 01:44:47,819
Same thing, bathroom.

1133
01:44:49,100 --> 01:44:50,699
Is there just like, just like taking a bath?

1134
01:44:53,449 --> 01:44:55,770
Let's see, like bath, just like taking bath.

1135
01:44:55,770 --> 01:44:56,729
Sad photo.

1136
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:03,699
Wait, what is bath horror?

1137
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:11,800
It's just already done.

1138
01:45:24,579 --> 01:45:25,460
Who's in the mirror?

1139
01:45:25,460 --> 01:45:26,659
There's nobody even in the mirror.

1140
01:45:30,359 --> 01:45:37,829
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a second.

1141
01:45:37,829 --> 01:45:39,109
So why, why can't,

1142
01:45:40,229 --> 01:45:45,699
has it got to be a better transitional piece here?

1143
01:45:45,699 --> 01:45:46,819
No, I want, let's, let's go with,

1144
01:45:50,199 --> 01:45:50,680
enter horror.

1145
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:51,560
Let me see what we got here.

1146
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:58,439
No, no, no, you're already in the bath.

1147
01:45:58,439 --> 01:45:59,399
This has to be somebody else.

1148
01:46:08,329 --> 01:46:10,890
Why would you have somebody smoking a cigarette in here?

1149
01:46:11,689 --> 01:46:14,170
All right, so he gets in the bath.

1150
01:46:16,890 --> 01:46:19,289
Just have like a bunch of angles of him getting into the bath.

1151
01:46:19,289 --> 01:46:22,439
All right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1152
01:46:22,439 --> 01:46:23,960
Yeah, yeah, okay, bath.

1153
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:30,520
Let's go, bath.

1154
01:46:32,489 --> 01:46:34,489
Bath, enter, bath, massage.

1155
01:46:34,489 --> 01:46:38,140
Bath, drown.

1156
01:46:38,140 --> 01:46:40,380
They sneak in and just drown them?

1157
01:46:40,380 --> 01:46:49,210
Hold on, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1158
01:46:49,210 --> 01:46:51,050
Wait, why are they, why would they be doing this?

1159
01:46:56,489 --> 01:46:57,770
Okay, hold on, hold on.

1160
01:47:03,130 --> 01:47:04,329
This has to be different people.

1161
01:47:06,979 --> 01:47:07,699
You two come in.

1162
01:47:08,420 --> 01:47:09,699
Why are you in different clothes?

1163
01:47:10,260 --> 01:47:19,930
He's in a different, he's in different clothes.

1164
01:47:24,739 --> 01:47:26,180
Why the fuck is his hair white?

1165
01:47:26,899 --> 01:47:31,020
This is like the Joker.

1166
01:47:39,140 --> 01:47:42,180
Why does his hair turn gray?

1167
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:43,779
Wait, who the fuck is this?

1168
01:47:43,779 --> 01:47:45,460
No, this is Adam Sandler in here.

1169
01:47:45,460 --> 01:47:46,979
Okay, well, that's what's going on.

1170
01:47:54,789 --> 01:47:55,750
Okay, that makes sense.

1171
01:47:55,750 --> 01:48:00,100
But then watch, why does his hair change color?

1172
01:48:00,100 --> 01:48:04,470
He comes in and then all of a sudden now he's, he has white hair.

1173
01:48:08,180 --> 01:48:13,750
Why did he age like 30 years?

1174
01:48:13,750 --> 01:48:14,550
Something, no, hold on.

1175
01:48:14,550 --> 01:48:21,189
Something ain't right here.

1176
01:48:21,189 --> 01:48:22,069
It's shampoo.

1177
01:48:28,149 --> 01:48:30,710
I didn't, I didn't set their costumes at the start.

1178
01:48:30,710 --> 01:48:31,270
Right, okay.

1179
01:48:32,090 --> 01:48:32,810
Well, it's all right.

1180
01:48:32,810 --> 01:48:35,289
We'll, we're learning again.

1181
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:48,020
All right, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1182
01:48:48,020 --> 01:48:49,539
I need to add a couple of scenes here.

1183
01:48:49,539 --> 01:48:50,340
Let's go static.

1184
01:48:55,479 --> 01:48:56,600
There's nobody in the scene,

1185
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:59,020
but we're going to put this over here.

1186
01:49:00,489 --> 01:49:01,930
Can I rearrange this?

1187
01:49:03,779 --> 01:49:04,420
I can, okay.

1188
01:49:05,060 --> 01:49:06,659
The static of the bathroom.

1189
01:49:07,300 --> 01:49:08,699
And he gets in.

1190
01:49:12,710 --> 01:49:13,670
No, no, no, he needs to get,

1191
01:49:13,670 --> 01:49:15,109
he needs to walk into the bathroom first.

1192
01:49:15,109 --> 01:49:15,750
That's important.

1193
01:49:21,989 --> 01:49:23,510
Here comes the soldiers.

1194
01:49:23,510 --> 01:49:24,710
Admire baby.

1195
01:49:26,010 --> 01:49:27,289
Applied perfume.

1196
01:49:29,909 --> 01:49:31,189
He's going to put perfume on

1197
01:49:31,189 --> 01:49:33,109
before he goes in the bath, apparently.

1198
01:49:33,750 --> 01:49:35,479
There's his hair again.

1199
01:49:35,479 --> 01:49:42,229
Put this back this way.

1200
01:49:45,289 --> 01:49:46,250
We need him coming in.

1201
01:49:48,390 --> 01:49:49,109
Enter cold.

1202
01:49:55,909 --> 01:49:58,229
All right, let's, I can't make this longer.

1203
01:49:59,659 --> 01:50:01,100
I don't want you to be here.

1204
01:50:01,100 --> 01:50:04,439
So we need to put, we need to put a dummy here, right?

1205
01:50:06,250 --> 01:50:06,890
Yeah.

1206
01:50:06,890 --> 01:50:18,699
Okay, so this is Jax coming in.

1207
01:50:25,369 --> 01:50:29,819
I'm flying perfume.

1208
01:50:30,539 --> 01:50:36,859
Drag the actor to the hanger.

1209
01:50:38,069 --> 01:50:38,630
Okay, right.

1210
01:50:38,630 --> 01:50:39,029
Here we go.

1211
01:50:51,399 --> 01:50:52,199
All right, is that,

1212
01:50:52,199 --> 01:50:53,560
will he be in this the whole time, I think?

1213
01:50:57,979 --> 01:51:01,020
Is he going to get in the bathtub with all his clothes on?

1214
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:09,800
Okay, hold on.

1215
01:51:16,439 --> 01:51:18,039
Are they in the same space team?

1216
01:51:28,359 --> 01:51:30,340
No, you don't even need to be here.

1217
01:51:30,340 --> 01:51:32,649
No, this lady doesn't need to be here.

1218
01:51:32,649 --> 01:51:34,090
We've done our trial run.

1219
01:51:34,090 --> 01:51:37,159
All right, now we need to,

1220
01:51:38,810 --> 01:51:41,750
I need to have you.

1221
01:51:41,750 --> 01:51:47,340
There's got to be a reason why this happens.

1222
01:51:47,340 --> 01:51:49,340
Bath horror, bath shock.

1223
01:51:49,340 --> 01:51:53,020
Someone is shocked by someone, something nasty in the bath.

1224
01:51:53,020 --> 01:52:02,970
Oh, it's, he's shocked by him in the bath.

1225
01:52:02,970 --> 01:52:09,720
All right, I want to put this down.

1226
01:52:09,720 --> 01:52:12,659
How do I move the camera down and up?

1227
01:52:12,659 --> 01:52:14,180
I forget what the controls are for this.

1228
01:52:14,739 --> 01:52:17,659
Because I want to put the camera in a different spot.

1229
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:29,640
What is it?

1230
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:31,930
Alt, arrow keys.

1231
01:52:31,930 --> 01:52:34,890
I think it's like shift and, shift and arrow keys.

1232
01:52:35,529 --> 01:52:36,409
Alt and the arrow keys.

1233
01:52:39,479 --> 01:52:40,520
Shift and scroll.

1234
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:41,960
I know it's something, some combination.

1235
01:52:42,600 --> 01:52:48,119
It's not middle mouse, W A S D.

1236
01:52:48,119 --> 01:52:49,960
No, it's come on, get down there.

1237
01:52:52,470 --> 01:52:56,340
Control, page up, page down.

1238
01:52:57,420 --> 01:52:57,819
Damn it.

1239
01:52:59,260 --> 01:52:59,500
Shit.

1240
01:53:00,789 --> 01:53:01,350
Well, it's all right.

1241
01:53:01,350 --> 01:53:02,630
I'll figure it out later.

1242
01:53:02,630 --> 01:53:04,229
So this needs to be over here.

1243
01:53:07,380 --> 01:53:09,300
And then have him get in the bath.

1244
01:53:09,859 --> 01:53:11,239
Plus and minus.

1245
01:53:13,029 --> 01:53:15,140
So he comes in, cold.

1246
01:53:16,229 --> 01:53:16,869
No, no, no, no, no.

1247
01:53:16,869 --> 01:53:17,909
This is going to be over here.

1248
01:53:23,319 --> 01:53:25,239
It's all plus shift plus tab.

1249
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:26,359
Wait, what?

1250
01:53:28,470 --> 01:53:32,250
And then he gets into the bath.

1251
01:53:32,250 --> 01:53:35,350
So enter bath.

1252
01:53:35,989 --> 01:53:45,659
Bath massage, bath horror, bath enter.

1253
01:53:46,220 --> 01:53:47,579
Now he's going to get in.

1254
01:53:47,579 --> 01:54:03,369
But I want the free-form cameras to show him like,

1255
01:54:03,369 --> 01:54:03,850
okay, hold on.

1256
01:54:03,850 --> 01:54:09,770
Like I need to be able to fucking move this camera.

1257
01:54:09,770 --> 01:54:19,779
All right.

1258
01:54:19,779 --> 01:54:23,539
What about here?

1259
01:54:23,539 --> 01:54:24,899
Toggle empty parts on.

1260
01:54:28,729 --> 01:54:29,689
And then he drowns.

1261
01:54:30,409 --> 01:54:34,840
He then he drowns him.

1262
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:35,159
All right.

1263
01:54:35,159 --> 01:54:36,600
Let me, let me, give me this.

1264
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:37,000
Okay.

1265
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:41,340
I think, let's just see how this looks.

1266
01:54:41,899 --> 01:54:45,720
Now we got to add music and sounds and shit.

1267
01:54:46,199 --> 01:54:49,609
Is it the number pad?

1268
01:54:49,609 --> 01:54:50,840
No, too bad.

1269
01:54:52,420 --> 01:54:52,739
All right.

1270
01:54:58,100 --> 01:55:02,630
So now let me just make sure that there's nothing else I want to really do.

1271
01:55:02,630 --> 01:55:03,909
Just to test this movie.

1272
01:55:04,550 --> 01:55:11,100
So now we have to have him like run away.

1273
01:55:17,159 --> 01:55:18,359
Should we just carry him out?

1274
01:55:21,689 --> 01:55:22,649
Walk with axe.

1275
01:55:23,289 --> 01:55:24,489
Carry box.

1276
01:55:24,489 --> 01:55:24,890
Jolt?

1277
01:55:25,689 --> 01:55:27,609
Wait, an explosion.

1278
01:55:38,140 --> 01:55:38,779
Intensity.

1279
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:41,539
Moderate duration short.

1280
01:55:49,130 --> 01:55:50,489
No, I don't, I don't want that.

1281
01:55:50,489 --> 01:55:51,130
I don't like it.

1282
01:55:51,850 --> 01:55:53,210
We're going to delete it.

1283
01:55:53,210 --> 01:56:04,229
How about investigation?

1284
01:56:04,229 --> 01:56:04,550
Prop.

1285
01:56:05,670 --> 01:56:06,710
Bashing objects.

1286
01:56:10,729 --> 01:56:11,609
Pick up weapon.

1287
01:56:11,609 --> 01:56:12,090
Traveling.

1288
01:56:12,090 --> 01:56:13,210
No, just, just exit.

1289
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:16,140
Violence.

1290
01:56:20,170 --> 01:56:21,289
No, no, no, no, no.

1291
01:56:21,289 --> 01:56:25,850
Let's do, what do we have for violence?

1292
01:56:27,460 --> 01:56:27,699
Fight.

1293
01:56:28,340 --> 01:56:29,539
Brandish blade.

1294
01:56:29,539 --> 01:56:30,340
Confrontation.

1295
01:56:30,340 --> 01:56:31,460
Dead body.

1296
01:56:31,460 --> 01:56:35,289
There's the scream spin.

1297
01:56:35,850 --> 01:56:37,050
Death in arms.

1298
01:56:37,689 --> 01:56:41,319
But he drowns him and then he dies in his arm?

1299
01:56:53,210 --> 01:56:59,100
Okay, what?

1300
01:57:01,260 --> 01:57:02,539
How, when does he die?

1301
01:57:02,539 --> 01:57:04,060
How long does it take for him to die?

1302
01:57:04,060 --> 01:57:05,739
Someone's just brushing their teeth.

1303
01:57:06,380 --> 01:57:08,789
Someone comes in and just starts brushing their teeth.

1304
01:57:09,590 --> 01:57:10,550
Not kissing.

1305
01:57:10,550 --> 01:57:12,140
Um, panic.

1306
01:57:33,859 --> 01:57:35,300
It's taking a very long time.

1307
01:57:35,300 --> 01:57:37,460
Is it, can I change the duration?

1308
01:57:38,180 --> 01:57:44,840
And then he drowns him again.

1309
01:57:56,020 --> 01:57:57,779
No, no, no, no.

1310
01:57:57,779 --> 01:57:58,659
Not opposites.

1311
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:04,380
You need to be, you need to pick him up and put him down in the bath and then drown him again.

1312
01:58:11,670 --> 01:58:14,310
This time, this, this time his hair is normal.

1313
01:58:16,220 --> 01:58:17,020
I hate this.

1314
01:58:17,659 --> 01:58:24,279
I need to like have it cut like here.

1315
01:58:25,319 --> 01:58:33,420
You know what I'm saying?

1316
01:58:33,420 --> 01:58:33,899
Not here.

1317
01:58:33,899 --> 01:58:36,300
I need to have him pick him up, put him down, like put him down

1318
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:37,579
and have the edit beat right here.

1319
01:58:42,949 --> 01:58:49,130
Okay, that looks good to me.

1320
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:51,640
Yeah, you do that in post.

1321
01:58:51,640 --> 01:58:51,880
Yep.

1322
01:58:52,680 --> 01:58:54,279
All right, so then, so he needs to pick him up.

1323
01:59:00,470 --> 01:59:01,270
Pick up weapon.

1324
01:59:01,270 --> 01:59:02,869
No, pick up or carry.

1325
01:59:05,909 --> 01:59:06,710
Carry person.

1326
01:59:07,270 --> 01:59:18,060
I don't know why there's so many random zombies.

1327
01:59:18,060 --> 01:59:18,619
Location.

1328
01:59:19,260 --> 01:59:22,140
Uh, we're going to go rescued, angry, dead.

1329
01:59:22,140 --> 01:59:22,460
Okay.

1330
01:59:23,579 --> 01:59:32,180
And then I need to put down.

1331
01:59:32,180 --> 01:59:33,300
So this needs to be over here.

1332
01:59:33,859 --> 01:59:36,699
He cries and then, is there a pick up?

1333
01:59:40,680 --> 01:59:42,039
Just have a zombie here?

1334
01:59:42,039 --> 01:59:44,039
No, that's not, that's not going to make any sense.

1335
01:59:45,159 --> 01:59:49,819
Uh, I need a, I need like a pick up.

1336
01:59:51,300 --> 01:59:52,100
Is there a pick?

1337
01:59:52,100 --> 01:59:52,659
I'm going to sneeze.

1338
01:59:58,979 --> 02:00:00,020
Investigate.

1339
02:00:00,020 --> 02:00:00,899
Close book.

1340
02:00:00,899 --> 02:00:01,140
No.

1341
02:00:01,779 --> 02:00:03,220
Someone is shocked by something.

1342
02:00:03,220 --> 02:00:04,020
Oh, no.

1343
02:00:07,050 --> 02:00:08,170
Read open book.

1344
02:00:08,170 --> 02:00:09,529
Take photo.

1345
02:00:09,529 --> 02:00:17,859
A group of people gather around a dead body.

1346
02:00:17,859 --> 02:00:18,739
Find corpse.

1347
02:00:21,579 --> 02:00:22,699
Prop focus.

1348
02:00:22,699 --> 02:00:23,659
Gun sneak by.

1349
02:00:25,289 --> 02:00:26,090
Murder scene.

1350
02:00:26,090 --> 02:00:26,329
No.

1351
02:00:27,899 --> 02:00:29,260
Is he reading on the toilet?

1352
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:32,520
All right, pacing.

1353
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:35,159
We need pacing because he can't, he doesn't know what to do.

1354
02:00:35,159 --> 02:00:36,520
So he's going to pick him up and drown him again.

1355
02:00:39,430 --> 02:00:40,470
Duration medium.

1356
02:00:44,010 --> 02:00:45,210
He's a little too happy though.

1357
02:00:48,520 --> 02:00:50,199
I wonder what's the solution here.

1358
02:00:59,100 --> 02:00:59,340
All right.

1359
02:00:59,340 --> 02:01:00,060
Put that here.

1360
02:01:05,420 --> 02:01:05,899
Drown.

1361
02:01:05,899 --> 02:01:06,220
Okay.

1362
02:01:06,220 --> 02:01:06,939
Then he's dead.

1363
02:01:07,659 --> 02:01:08,939
Doesn't know what to do.

1364
02:01:08,939 --> 02:01:09,579
Picks him up.

1365
02:01:09,579 --> 02:01:10,779
Puts him back in the bathtub.

1366
02:01:10,779 --> 02:01:12,060
I need a pick up body.

1367
02:01:16,739 --> 02:01:17,300
Enter.

1368
02:01:17,300 --> 02:01:17,939
Horror.

1369
02:01:17,939 --> 02:01:18,420
Exit.

1370
02:01:18,420 --> 02:01:18,819
Carry.

1371
02:01:20,300 --> 02:01:20,779
Enter.

1372
02:01:20,779 --> 02:01:21,260
Carry.

1373
02:01:25,300 --> 02:01:30,699
Pick up weapon.

1374
02:01:36,630 --> 02:01:37,350
Examine.

1375
02:01:37,350 --> 02:01:38,710
Examine would probably be fine.

1376
02:01:38,710 --> 02:01:39,189
That's right.

1377
02:01:39,829 --> 02:01:40,869
Examine body.

1378
02:01:41,829 --> 02:01:43,960
Let's just see what it looks like.

1379
02:01:49,350 --> 02:01:50,550
Different, wrong people, but.

1380
02:01:51,510 --> 02:01:52,390
Look, you cut it right here.

1381
02:01:53,350 --> 02:01:55,020
Okay, this one's good.

1382
02:01:55,659 --> 02:02:01,239
We could trim it so he ends up picking him up.

1383
02:02:01,239 --> 02:02:02,439
You know, it goes down like this.

1384
02:02:04,170 --> 02:02:05,529
And then we cut to him walking.

1385
02:02:06,250 --> 02:02:15,270
Checking his pulse.

1386
02:02:15,270 --> 02:02:16,149
Reaction to body.

1387
02:02:16,149 --> 02:02:16,710
Angry.

1388
02:02:16,710 --> 02:02:17,430
Sad.

1389
02:02:17,430 --> 02:02:17,670
Laugh.

1390
02:02:31,619 --> 02:02:32,420
Why is he going?

1391
02:02:50,329 --> 02:02:51,289
No, no, no.

1392
02:02:51,289 --> 02:02:51,850
I hate it.

1393
02:02:53,670 --> 02:02:54,550
That's no.

1394
02:02:55,189 --> 02:02:57,210
We're going to do sad.

1395
02:03:00,859 --> 02:03:01,579
Sad works.

1396
02:03:03,050 --> 02:03:05,289
So that is over here.

1397
02:03:05,289 --> 02:03:07,560
So then he picks him up.

1398
02:03:08,119 --> 02:03:10,310
All right.

1399
02:03:10,949 --> 02:03:12,060
Drowns him again.

1400
02:03:13,420 --> 02:03:14,699
And then runs out.

1401
02:03:18,699 --> 02:03:20,619
I don't know why I just did war bombed street.

1402
02:03:27,640 --> 02:03:28,840
Sniper search.

1403
02:03:37,909 --> 02:03:38,949
Sniper duel.

1404
02:03:38,949 --> 02:03:41,460
We can do that later.

1405
02:03:41,460 --> 02:03:42,180
No, this is good.

1406
02:03:42,180 --> 02:03:42,659
This is good.

1407
02:03:42,659 --> 02:03:42,979
This is good.

1408
02:03:42,979 --> 02:03:43,779
This is done.

1409
02:03:43,779 --> 02:03:46,100
I can edit it.

1410
02:03:46,100 --> 02:03:48,979
I just want to, I just, we're just doing a little one just to try.

1411
02:03:48,979 --> 02:03:53,460
Get out of town.

1412
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:56,039
It's just a default name.

1413
02:03:58,180 --> 02:03:58,899
Okay.

1414
02:03:58,899 --> 02:04:08,069
Now I bring this over to, what do I bring this now?

1415
02:04:08,069 --> 02:04:08,789
Over to casting.

1416
02:04:14,170 --> 02:04:14,970
And then they shoot it.

1417
02:04:15,529 --> 02:04:18,579
But isn't it, it's not already cast?

1418
02:04:19,300 --> 02:04:24,899
I thought I already did that in the advanced section.

1419
02:04:24,899 --> 02:04:25,140
No?

1420
02:04:25,779 --> 02:04:29,460
Yeah, it is cast.

1421
02:04:29,460 --> 02:04:30,659
So what's, I don't understand.

1422
02:04:33,180 --> 02:04:34,300
You have to do that, I guess.

1423
02:04:35,260 --> 02:04:35,739
Let me see.

1424
02:04:38,090 --> 02:04:38,409
All right.

1425
02:04:38,409 --> 02:04:39,050
No, it is.

1426
02:04:39,050 --> 02:04:40,489
So we just need some extras.

1427
02:04:40,489 --> 02:04:41,609
Who is the, what do you mean extras?

1428
02:04:51,159 --> 02:04:52,680
Who are the, who's an extra in this?

1429
02:04:53,239 --> 02:04:57,079
Why would there be an extra?

1430
02:04:57,079 --> 02:05:08,279
How do I get an extra in here?

1431
02:05:08,279 --> 02:05:09,319
I don't know who this is.

1432
02:05:14,460 --> 02:05:15,260
Writers needed.

1433
02:05:15,260 --> 02:05:16,859
There's no one writing the script.

1434
02:05:20,420 --> 02:05:24,020
Shoot it.

1435
02:05:24,020 --> 02:05:24,260
Okay.

1436
02:05:24,260 --> 02:05:24,979
This should be done.

1437
02:05:28,550 --> 02:05:29,829
I have instant movie making, right?

1438
02:05:38,420 --> 02:05:38,819
All right.

1439
02:05:38,819 --> 02:05:45,720
So now I take this into, what do I take this into?

1440
02:05:46,439 --> 02:05:50,569
I take it into like the advanced movie maker, right?

1441
02:05:51,130 --> 02:05:55,189
I think, actually, I don't think I have it.

1442
02:05:55,829 --> 02:05:58,250
Post-production.

1443
02:05:58,890 --> 02:06:02,840
Do I not have one of these?

1444
02:06:02,840 --> 02:06:03,319
I thought I did.

1445
02:06:06,170 --> 02:06:06,489
Okay.

1446
02:06:14,869 --> 02:06:15,829
Post-production.

1447
02:06:15,829 --> 02:06:16,550
Here we go.

1448
02:06:16,550 --> 02:06:22,170
Welcome to post-production where you can edit and enhance your movies in a variety of ways.

1449
02:06:22,170 --> 02:06:27,689
You can also export your movies as files that you can then send to your friends or post online.

1450
02:06:29,319 --> 02:06:29,880
It's time.

1451
02:06:30,520 --> 02:06:32,199
It's time to make the doughnuts.

1452
02:06:33,270 --> 02:06:38,569
So let's open up the, the art of war is the song.

1453
02:06:45,189 --> 02:06:47,350
No, it ain't going to be the art of war.

1454
02:06:47,350 --> 02:06:51,739
How do I remove that?

1455
02:06:51,739 --> 02:06:52,300
Just delete it.

1456
02:06:52,939 --> 02:06:53,539
All right.

1457
02:06:53,539 --> 02:06:54,819
Let's get a song here.

1458
02:06:54,819 --> 02:06:56,260
No, I'm not going to do acid bass.

1459
02:06:56,979 --> 02:07:03,670
How's this one?

1460
02:07:03,670 --> 02:07:16,500
How about Armageddon?

1461
02:07:17,300 --> 02:07:18,500
Advancing Army.

1462
02:07:19,859 --> 02:07:20,739
How's about that?

1463
02:07:21,300 --> 02:07:23,989
That's essentially the same title as the movie.

1464
02:07:28,140 --> 02:07:33,829
I don't, I like it.

1465
02:07:33,829 --> 02:07:35,189
Let's put the volume down a little bit.

1466
02:07:35,909 --> 02:07:38,229
Uh, I want something, I want a better title in here.

1467
02:07:38,869 --> 02:07:43,189
I'm going to add a title because I don't like this one.

1468
02:07:43,829 --> 02:07:46,140
Now, Lionhead movies.

1469
02:07:46,140 --> 02:07:46,699
No, no, no.

1470
02:07:48,069 --> 02:07:49,430
How do we get out of this title?

1471
02:07:49,989 --> 02:07:56,329
I think we can add it later.

1472
02:07:56,329 --> 02:07:57,609
Maybe ABC.

1473
02:07:58,409 --> 02:07:59,029
Oh yeah.

1474
02:07:59,029 --> 02:08:00,630
I can record voiceover on this too.

1475
02:08:05,189 --> 02:08:05,750
Let's see here.

1476
02:08:06,390 --> 02:08:14,380
So this starts out like this static.

1477
02:08:14,939 --> 02:08:16,460
Hold on.

1478
02:08:16,460 --> 02:08:19,100
It's because he comes in with them.

1479
02:08:19,100 --> 02:08:21,979
I didn't, I, is this the extra?

1480
02:08:25,510 --> 02:08:27,029
It's so fast.

1481
02:08:28,310 --> 02:08:28,630
Okay.

1482
02:08:34,789 --> 02:08:35,189
Okay.

1483
02:08:35,189 --> 02:08:35,510
All right.

1484
02:08:35,510 --> 02:08:36,229
All right.

1485
02:08:36,229 --> 02:08:38,229
Now we know where the extra is and I can't remove them.

1486
02:08:38,229 --> 02:08:39,109
It's already been filmed.

1487
02:08:45,979 --> 02:08:46,460
Okay.

1488
02:08:46,460 --> 02:08:47,979
So we need some sound here.

1489
02:08:48,619 --> 02:08:53,380
We need like a, okay.

1490
02:08:53,380 --> 02:08:54,260
How about right here?

1491
02:08:55,539 --> 02:09:04,729
Let's have bed squeak door, open door, metal, bang, metal, freak, whistle.

1492
02:09:04,729 --> 02:09:05,289
Police.

1493
02:09:05,289 --> 02:09:06,409
What is whistle police?

1494
02:09:15,449 --> 02:09:15,689
No.

1495
02:09:19,460 --> 02:09:24,060
Human sounds.

1496
02:09:24,060 --> 02:09:25,819
It has to be like, mm hmm.

1497
02:09:27,689 --> 02:09:46,409
I'll have a cough and then he gets in.

1498
02:09:46,409 --> 02:09:47,210
He gets in the bath.

1499
02:09:47,930 --> 02:09:55,109
He comes in way too fast.

1500
02:09:55,109 --> 02:09:55,510
Okay.

1501
02:09:55,510 --> 02:10:05,829
Now we need, we need like a, we need like a, oh, it's hot.

1502
02:10:10,199 --> 02:10:10,680
Scream.

1503
02:10:11,560 --> 02:10:14,920
Is there a way you can hear them?

1504
02:10:14,920 --> 02:10:15,640
I thought there was.

1505
02:10:16,439 --> 02:10:17,640
Why don't I just make the noise?

1506
02:10:24,550 --> 02:10:24,869
Okay.

1507
02:10:24,869 --> 02:10:28,340
So it's too hot.

1508
02:10:29,510 --> 02:10:29,750
All right.

1509
02:10:29,750 --> 02:10:31,029
We need, we need a scream here.

1510
02:10:31,829 --> 02:10:46,180
So like right here.

1511
02:10:49,779 --> 02:10:50,180
It's good.

1512
02:10:50,180 --> 02:11:04,649
And then we need like an, ah, this is probably fine.

1513
02:11:11,220 --> 02:11:13,449
That's not what I thought it was going to be.

1514
02:11:13,449 --> 02:11:15,130
It's just one grunt.

1515
02:11:26,250 --> 02:11:27,529
It's because the camera.

1516
02:11:27,529 --> 02:11:34,649
I wanted to have to, is it, can I not?

1517
02:11:34,649 --> 02:11:36,329
How do I make the camera stay?

1518
02:11:37,779 --> 02:11:39,060
That's very important.

1519
02:11:44,329 --> 02:11:46,010
He's going to scream a couple of times too.

1520
02:11:51,109 --> 02:11:52,550
Not a porn game.

1521
02:11:52,550 --> 02:11:59,689
All right.

1522
02:11:59,689 --> 02:12:04,779
Hold on.

1523
02:12:04,779 --> 02:12:05,659
No, no, no, no, no.

1524
02:12:05,659 --> 02:12:09,800
It's going to be like a pluzz.

1525
02:12:09,800 --> 02:12:10,520
No belch.

1526
02:12:10,520 --> 02:12:11,239
No cough.

1527
02:12:12,039 --> 02:12:15,159
He does kind of like cough a little, like right here.

1528
02:12:15,159 --> 02:12:16,119
He turns over.

1529
02:12:16,119 --> 02:12:17,079
He turns his head over.

1530
02:12:25,260 --> 02:12:37,270
We need, ah, scream.

1531
02:12:38,229 --> 02:12:40,819
One, scream.

1532
02:12:41,380 --> 02:12:46,949
Two, sniff.

1533
02:13:07,130 --> 02:13:09,060
Okay.

1534
02:13:09,060 --> 02:13:11,159
Big slurp.

1535
02:13:12,390 --> 02:13:13,189
This looks good.

1536
02:13:13,989 --> 02:13:25,880
And then we need like, ah, breathe heavy.

1537
02:13:44,420 --> 02:13:55,659
This goes on so long.

1538
02:13:58,220 --> 02:14:03,220
He's, he's, he's smelling his hands.

1539
02:14:11,779 --> 02:14:13,300
That's so stupid.

1540
02:14:13,300 --> 02:14:13,779
There you go.

1541
02:14:23,220 --> 02:14:24,579
It's the purview.

1542
02:14:26,659 --> 02:14:37,590
I can't put a fart sound in here.

1543
02:14:37,590 --> 02:14:38,789
That's so easy.

1544
02:14:40,119 --> 02:14:41,399
We need to have like coughing.

1545
02:15:10,539 --> 02:15:11,579
He's like swallowing.

1546
02:15:11,579 --> 02:15:12,619
This is so awful.

1547
02:15:12,619 --> 02:15:15,739
He's swallowing so much water that he's just like.

1548
02:15:17,979 --> 02:15:19,180
These aren't even burps.

1549
02:15:20,680 --> 02:15:44,460
This is fucking horrible.

1550
02:15:48,170 --> 02:15:49,369
No, we need more coughs.

1551
02:15:49,369 --> 02:15:50,329
This burp sucks.

1552
02:16:08,949 --> 02:16:48,149
I'm only going to put this in temporarily because people are demanding it.

1553
02:16:48,149 --> 02:16:50,860
No, no, no, it's not.

1554
02:16:50,860 --> 02:16:52,219
It's so stupid.

1555
02:16:53,290 --> 02:16:54,409
I don't know if I can have it.

1556
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
You guys realize I have to do this again.

1557
02:17:11,719 --> 02:17:12,920
This happens another time.

1558
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:29,719
Fuck this.

1559
02:17:31,159 --> 02:17:32,040
The little shake.

1560
02:17:33,159 --> 02:17:34,280
It's like right here.

1561
02:17:55,610 --> 02:17:58,729
No, but if he smells here, then I.

1562
02:18:02,120 --> 02:18:04,680
No, this changes everything.

1563
02:18:16,739 --> 02:18:18,899
No, it can't be like this.

1564
02:18:18,899 --> 02:18:59,139
Come on, don't start lagging on me now.

1565
02:19:19,819 --> 02:19:21,340
Back here, back here, back here.

1566
02:19:21,340 --> 02:19:33,459
It's going to be more frequent.

1567
02:19:48,739 --> 02:19:51,139
It's supposed to be smelling the perfume and not the.

1568
02:19:52,340 --> 02:19:56,649
Does it kind of copy these?

1569
02:19:56,649 --> 02:19:57,610
Is there a way I can just copy?

1570
02:20:11,770 --> 02:20:12,569
I hate that.

1571
02:20:13,209 --> 02:20:25,719
This is fucked up.

1572
02:20:25,719 --> 02:20:43,909
This is this is like getting borderline not safe for work.

1573
02:20:44,549 --> 02:20:52,389
All right.

1574
02:20:52,389 --> 02:20:54,069
Then what happens is he picks up.

1575
02:20:54,069 --> 02:21:03,610
Okay, right here.

1576
02:21:03,610 --> 02:21:04,889
I mean, he dies.

1577
02:21:08,299 --> 02:21:09,500
I don't even need the scene.

1578
02:21:09,500 --> 02:21:10,860
This whole scene doesn't even need to exist.

1579
02:21:15,559 --> 02:21:33,780
And this whole scene doesn't need to exist because I want to cut this portion.

1580
02:21:33,780 --> 02:21:34,500
How do I do that?

1581
02:21:35,979 --> 02:21:36,940
Is there like a scissor?

1582
02:21:36,940 --> 02:21:37,340
There it is.

1583
02:21:38,379 --> 02:21:39,659
Audio options.

1584
02:21:39,659 --> 02:21:40,459
Yeah, that's fine.

1585
02:21:41,180 --> 02:21:42,219
Here it is.

1586
02:21:42,219 --> 02:21:50,040
Split scene because I wanted to pick them up like here.

1587
02:21:53,659 --> 02:21:55,100
Right at the edge there.

1588
02:21:57,959 --> 02:21:58,680
Like right there.

1589
02:22:02,120 --> 02:22:04,569
Like right here.

1590
02:22:04,569 --> 02:22:07,799
We can get rid of these.

1591
02:22:13,979 --> 02:22:19,770
Okay, now I should be able to drag this into here.

1592
02:22:21,610 --> 02:22:21,930
Yes.

1593
02:22:22,889 --> 02:22:23,750
Delete this.

1594
02:22:27,989 --> 02:22:28,229
Yes.

1595
02:22:29,270 --> 02:22:32,069
And that's him picked now.

1596
02:22:32,069 --> 02:22:34,069
He lifts his head up.

1597
02:22:34,069 --> 02:22:40,219
Let's put the scene here.

1598
02:22:40,860 --> 02:22:58,809
And then he needs to put him back down.

1599
02:23:02,059 --> 02:23:03,850
And then down.

1600
02:23:06,309 --> 02:23:08,979
So right here.

1601
02:23:09,850 --> 02:23:10,329
Right here.

1602
02:23:24,440 --> 02:23:25,879
Why is he out of the tub though?

1603
02:23:30,549 --> 02:23:32,549
This whole scene, I'm getting rid of this one.

1604
02:23:32,549 --> 02:23:33,909
It doesn't even need to be here.

1605
02:23:33,909 --> 02:23:41,770
We're changing the music too.

1606
02:23:45,819 --> 02:23:46,319
What?

1607
02:23:51,850 --> 02:23:52,889
Oh, it's because...

1608
02:23:52,889 --> 02:23:53,770
Oh, shit.

1609
02:23:53,770 --> 02:23:56,659
The timeline changed.

1610
02:23:57,930 --> 02:23:58,409
How do I...

1611
02:23:58,409 --> 02:23:59,450
Can I put them all together?

1612
02:24:01,860 --> 02:24:04,139
Why did that happen?

1613
02:24:04,139 --> 02:24:05,020
I didn't move these.

1614
02:24:05,579 --> 02:24:10,059
The timeline changed down here because I edited...

1615
02:24:10,059 --> 02:24:11,899
Okay, you gotta edit that shit up top first.

1616
02:24:14,729 --> 02:24:15,370
That's all right.

1617
02:24:15,370 --> 02:24:16,170
I can just move it forward.

1618
02:24:16,889 --> 02:24:17,690
This is the cough room.

1619
02:24:19,610 --> 02:24:31,860
Just move everything forward.

1620
02:24:31,860 --> 02:24:33,299
That cough is right here.

1621
02:24:37,620 --> 02:24:44,729
A little bit more.

1622
02:24:44,729 --> 02:24:45,930
And then he gets in the bathtub.

1623
02:24:58,309 --> 02:25:01,459
Right there.

1624
02:25:02,260 --> 02:25:03,770
All right, that's a good spot.

1625
02:25:12,219 --> 02:25:12,940
Who's crying?

1626
02:25:15,100 --> 02:25:18,469
Why is somebody crying?

1627
02:25:23,450 --> 02:25:24,729
Oh, he cries.

1628
02:25:24,729 --> 02:25:25,209
He does.

1629
02:25:27,819 --> 02:25:28,299
It's him.

1630
02:25:33,670 --> 02:25:34,709
He cries like right here.

1631
02:25:47,780 --> 02:25:49,379
This music is gonna drive me fucking crazy.

1632
02:26:25,270 --> 02:26:31,899
It's not even funny.

1633
02:26:32,860 --> 02:26:34,780
I don't know why I laugh at it every time.

1634
02:26:34,780 --> 02:26:35,899
It's not even funny.

1635
02:26:45,290 --> 02:27:01,340
All right, we need a little bit more.

1636
02:27:02,840 --> 02:27:03,879
We need music to...

1637
02:27:03,879 --> 02:27:04,920
The music's changed right here.

1638
02:27:09,180 --> 02:27:10,819
What was that?

1639
02:27:10,819 --> 02:27:11,540
Did you hear that?

1640
02:27:14,659 --> 02:27:15,299
What was that?

1641
02:27:17,540 --> 02:27:23,100
There's like 20 people screaming.

1642
02:27:33,739 --> 02:27:40,969
Music changes.

1643
02:27:55,530 --> 02:28:11,899
And right now.

1644
02:28:16,700 --> 02:28:29,739
Okay, here's...

1645
02:28:32,659 --> 02:28:35,739
This one needs to be changed,

1646
02:28:35,739 --> 02:28:37,260
and then this one changes too like that.

1647
02:28:40,139 --> 02:28:55,420
Right here.

1648
02:28:55,420 --> 02:28:57,180
All right, we gotta add a couple more screams.

1649
02:28:59,850 --> 02:29:02,569
This is the only fart that's gonna be in the entire stream, by the way.

1650
02:29:02,569 --> 02:29:13,899
There's not gonna be any more farts.

1651
02:29:13,899 --> 02:29:15,579
I can promise you that.

1652
02:29:15,579 --> 02:29:27,129
Okay, I need a couple more coughs.

1653
02:29:34,389 --> 02:30:07,959
I fucking want to remove it so bad.

1654
02:30:15,750 --> 02:30:31,670
I need one more cough.

1655
02:30:31,670 --> 02:30:32,950
What does slurp sound like?

1656
02:30:37,370 --> 02:30:38,569
No, that's not gonna work.

1657
02:30:40,260 --> 02:30:40,899
Get rid of this.

1658
02:30:46,620 --> 02:30:47,420
Bullet?

1659
02:30:51,379 --> 02:30:52,420
Call of Duty hit sound.

1660
02:30:52,420 --> 02:30:59,829
Okay, all right.

1661
02:30:59,829 --> 02:31:01,030
Last, I need a cough.

1662
02:31:01,030 --> 02:31:01,750
One more cough.

1663
02:31:08,149 --> 02:31:08,870
Like right here.

1664
02:31:13,909 --> 02:31:18,219
Do a bubble noise after the fart.

1665
02:31:18,780 --> 02:31:19,899
Oh my god.

1666
02:31:30,219 --> 02:31:32,700
What if we just dropped a fucking huge dump in here?

1667
02:31:49,860 --> 02:31:50,899
Splash bath?

1668
02:31:57,459 --> 02:31:59,620
Okay, we need to get...

1669
02:31:59,620 --> 02:32:01,299
The song has to start playing again.

1670
02:32:09,030 --> 02:32:14,659
I think actually...

1671
02:32:14,659 --> 02:32:15,379
No, hold on.

1672
02:33:00,549 --> 02:33:01,430
No, I'm sorry, guys.

1673
02:33:01,430 --> 02:33:02,790
This is not gonna be like a dump.

1674
02:33:03,590 --> 02:33:05,030
That's like TOS.

1675
02:33:05,030 --> 02:33:06,309
I'm not gonna get like dumped.

1676
02:33:50,790 --> 02:33:57,159
All right, I need to cut this track here.

1677
02:33:57,719 --> 02:34:01,190
No, no, no, no, no.

1678
02:34:01,190 --> 02:34:02,149
Undo, undo, undo.

1679
02:34:02,149 --> 02:34:03,430
That's not what I wanted to do.

1680
02:34:03,430 --> 02:34:06,069
Is there an undo button?

1681
02:34:06,069 --> 02:34:10,020
I think there is.

1682
02:34:10,579 --> 02:34:13,110
Where is it?

1683
02:34:13,110 --> 02:34:15,979
Control Z?

1684
02:34:15,979 --> 02:34:18,149
Will the bullet work?

1685
02:34:18,149 --> 02:34:21,719
No, there is no undo.

1686
02:34:21,719 --> 02:34:24,440
Gotta be aware that there is no undo.

1687
02:34:24,440 --> 02:34:31,799
So how do I make this smaller?

1688
02:34:31,799 --> 02:34:34,309
How do I get rid of that?

1689
02:34:34,309 --> 02:34:47,209
Toggle mumbly that they can like be mumbling.

1690
02:34:47,290 --> 02:34:48,489
Top left, that's exit.

1691
02:34:49,129 --> 02:34:53,100
Do you want to click the exit button

1692
02:34:53,100 --> 02:34:56,379
and waste the last like 45 minutes in this dumb movie?

1693
02:35:01,540 --> 02:35:03,540
I think I can do no sound, right?

1694
02:35:03,540 --> 02:35:05,780
Wasn't there a track that's like no, like kill the audio?

1695
02:35:06,420 --> 02:35:09,079
I think there is one.

1696
02:35:11,750 --> 02:35:12,549
Isn't there like a hundred?

1697
02:35:12,549 --> 02:35:13,350
How do I get rid of that?

1698
02:35:19,209 --> 02:35:20,010
Because I can't...

1699
02:35:22,309 --> 02:35:29,270
Yeah, I can't like drag, like click and drag.

1700
02:35:29,909 --> 02:35:32,340
This has got to be something, right?

1701
02:35:33,059 --> 02:35:36,340
I don't think so.

1702
02:35:36,979 --> 02:35:43,610
I can adjust the volume on the whole, on the master.

1703
02:35:44,250 --> 02:35:48,260
Yeah, right click doesn't do anything.

1704
02:35:48,260 --> 02:35:50,180
The scissor just cuts, but hold on.

1705
02:35:54,489 --> 02:36:02,170
No, no, no.

1706
02:36:02,170 --> 02:36:04,170
Just cut the clip and remove the end part.

1707
02:36:04,170 --> 02:36:06,010
Yeah, that's what I was trying to do, but I can't...

1708
02:36:09,049 --> 02:36:13,110
I can't cut the clip for some reason.

1709
02:36:13,110 --> 02:36:16,389
When I click here, it cuts the video track.

1710
02:36:16,950 --> 02:36:20,299
That's what I thought, right?

1711
02:36:20,299 --> 02:36:22,620
Split scene, just splitting the scene.

1712
02:36:25,930 --> 02:36:33,590
It's all right.

1713
02:36:33,590 --> 02:36:35,110
There should be more than one audio channel.

1714
02:36:35,110 --> 02:36:38,629
Yeah, it's not as advanced as you might think.

1715
02:36:40,250 --> 02:36:41,450
Save the game, save the game.

1716
02:36:41,610 --> 02:36:42,250
I will, I will.

1717
02:36:42,969 --> 02:36:43,850
We're good, but I...

1718
02:36:43,850 --> 02:36:44,569
Hold on, hold on.

1719
02:36:49,979 --> 02:36:50,860
This is this...

1720
02:36:50,860 --> 02:36:52,379
Fine, it doesn't matter.

1721
02:36:52,379 --> 02:36:53,180
All right, we got it.

1722
02:36:57,370 --> 02:36:57,850
It's all right.

1723
02:36:57,850 --> 02:36:59,850
We could just have the music played over again.

1724
02:37:00,489 --> 02:37:05,829
And so then, I'm not doing all that again.

1725
02:37:05,829 --> 02:37:07,350
I'm just going to do some coughs.

1726
02:37:07,350 --> 02:37:08,629
We got to export this shit.

1727
02:37:18,010 --> 02:37:18,889
Wait, what happened to the...

1728
02:37:18,889 --> 02:37:19,610
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1729
02:37:19,610 --> 02:37:21,610
What happened to the video files that were back here?

1730
02:37:22,840 --> 02:37:23,319
What happened?

1731
02:37:40,540 --> 02:37:41,579
Oh, okay, okay.

1732
02:37:41,579 --> 02:37:43,260
First, I'm all the way back here now.

1733
02:37:43,260 --> 02:37:52,629
All right, here we go.

1734
02:37:53,190 --> 02:37:56,629
I wish I could just copy all these and put them over here, but I can't.

1735
02:37:56,629 --> 02:37:57,909
So here's what we're going to do.

1736
02:37:57,909 --> 02:38:03,959
Let's have him...

1737
02:38:03,959 --> 02:38:04,440
Let's see.

1738
02:38:26,620 --> 02:38:27,659
Now I'm yawning.

1739
02:38:27,659 --> 02:38:28,700
No, I'm going to yawn too.

1740
02:38:32,250 --> 02:38:33,129
How is that a yawn?

1741
02:38:33,690 --> 02:38:34,170
That's enough.

1742
02:38:34,170 --> 02:38:35,290
That's a yawn, apparently.

1743
02:38:58,760 --> 02:39:03,290
That don't fit.

1744
02:39:31,659 --> 02:39:32,540
Here we go again.

1745
02:39:33,340 --> 02:39:34,299
Here we go again.

1746
02:39:34,299 --> 02:39:34,620
Okay.

1747
02:39:47,959 --> 02:39:50,069
Where is it?

1748
02:39:50,069 --> 02:39:50,870
Belch.

1749
02:39:50,870 --> 02:40:33,430
Okay.

1750
02:40:33,430 --> 02:40:50,260
Comedy music for the drowning.

1751
02:41:02,700 --> 02:41:02,940
It's...

1752
02:41:08,899 --> 02:41:13,879
Every movie I make in this has the same repeat the scene thing.

1753
02:41:37,879 --> 02:41:39,079
Breaking his neck.

1754
02:41:42,649 --> 02:41:43,690
Oh, God.

1755
02:42:16,969 --> 02:42:18,649
Oh, my God.

1756
02:42:18,649 --> 02:42:34,010
Okay.

1757
02:42:34,010 --> 02:42:37,500
Should I change my stream to like 18 and over?

1758
02:42:50,409 --> 02:42:51,610
Well, now I need to.

1759
02:42:54,579 --> 02:42:55,299
All right, let me get...

1760
02:42:56,100 --> 02:42:56,819
Hold on.

1761
02:42:56,819 --> 02:43:11,590
Beauty like no other leads into...

1762
02:43:12,309 --> 02:43:13,190
Get this out of here.

1763
02:43:29,700 --> 02:43:29,940
All right.

1764
02:43:29,940 --> 02:43:32,420
I'm actually going to remove this because we don't need it anymore.

1765
02:43:33,479 --> 02:43:36,840
No!

1766
02:43:36,840 --> 02:43:38,440
The timeline does that thing.

1767
02:43:43,420 --> 02:43:43,979
Shit.

1768
02:43:43,979 --> 02:43:45,340
Why does it do that?

1769
02:43:45,340 --> 02:43:50,940
Oh, that sucks.

1770
02:43:50,940 --> 02:43:52,780
That whole thing gets ruined down here.

1771
02:43:52,780 --> 02:43:53,739
I don't remember that happening.

1772
02:43:56,010 --> 02:43:56,889
There is no undo.

1773
02:44:02,329 --> 02:44:03,450
That has to be an undo.

1774
02:44:08,600 --> 02:44:08,920
Right?

1775
02:44:08,920 --> 02:44:10,040
Like that has to be.

1776
02:44:10,040 --> 02:44:17,129
Oh, it controls.

1777
02:44:17,129 --> 02:44:17,930
He doesn't do anything.

1778
02:44:25,340 --> 02:44:25,899
Shit.

1779
02:44:25,899 --> 02:44:26,700
Really?

1780
02:44:26,700 --> 02:44:28,059
That sucks that it does that.

1781
02:44:29,100 --> 02:44:36,940
I'm not going to click the exit button.

1782
02:44:37,579 --> 02:44:39,739
I got to like burn that into my brain

1783
02:44:39,739 --> 02:44:41,420
that if you change anything up here,

1784
02:44:41,420 --> 02:44:45,209
it shrinks the whole every single timeline.

1785
02:44:45,209 --> 02:44:47,129
You can map an undo key.

1786
02:44:47,129 --> 02:44:51,110
Delete.

1787
02:44:51,850 --> 02:44:52,889
Thumbnail.

1788
02:44:52,889 --> 02:44:53,290
Split.

1789
02:44:53,290 --> 02:44:54,329
Like why are these grayed out?

1790
02:44:54,889 --> 02:44:56,200
What is this?

1791
02:44:57,159 --> 02:44:57,559
Fade out.

1792
02:44:57,559 --> 02:44:58,680
Oh, fade out and fade in.

1793
02:44:59,239 --> 02:45:02,579
That sucks.

1794
02:45:02,579 --> 02:45:11,030
I haven't unlocked the undo.

1795
02:45:12,309 --> 02:45:14,100
Well, hold on.

1796
02:45:15,899 --> 02:45:17,020
And that's the end of the movie.

1797
02:45:18,139 --> 02:45:22,139
Watch the undo tutorial.

1798
02:45:22,139 --> 02:45:24,520
I wonder.

1799
02:45:25,079 --> 02:45:29,139
Deleting scenes, cutting scenes, moving scenes.

1800
02:45:30,899 --> 02:45:32,100
No, I don't think that's going to do it.

1801
02:45:35,540 --> 02:45:37,700
Yeah, what I'm going to have to burn into my memory

1802
02:45:37,700 --> 02:45:39,459
is trim everything, get everything the way

1803
02:45:39,459 --> 02:45:41,860
that I want it first completely

1804
02:45:41,860 --> 02:45:42,899
and then do sound effects.

1805
02:45:42,899 --> 02:45:46,020
So I'm going to have to go for it here.

1806
02:45:46,020 --> 02:45:48,180
Just have to move everything like an inch forward.

1807
02:45:55,459 --> 02:45:56,180
And then that's it.

1808
02:46:08,250 --> 02:46:09,129
What a pain in the ass.

1809
02:46:12,940 --> 02:46:14,780
I wish they would remake this game

1810
02:46:14,780 --> 02:46:17,979
and put all the quality of life features that it deserves.

1811
02:46:26,950 --> 02:46:31,239
Can I move the whole timeline?

1812
02:46:31,239 --> 02:46:32,360
I don't think so.

1813
02:46:32,360 --> 02:46:34,600
No, when you click in the timeline,

1814
02:46:34,600 --> 02:46:36,120
you just add a sound.

1815
02:46:38,260 --> 02:46:40,500
Yeah, save every before you do everything.

1816
02:46:41,459 --> 02:46:43,450
It is a learning process.

1817
02:46:45,770 --> 02:46:48,870
Yeah, the whole thing just has to go forward again.

1818
02:47:05,850 --> 02:47:09,620
Check you have control in the undo.

1819
02:47:09,620 --> 02:47:10,979
I'm scared to hit escape.

1820
02:47:12,860 --> 02:47:14,299
No, I can't go anywhere.

1821
02:47:14,299 --> 02:47:15,579
I don't have any options or anything.

1822
02:47:30,409 --> 02:47:35,209
Deleting the game.

1823
02:47:38,389 --> 02:47:40,229
Oh, I had them in a perfect spot, too.

1824
02:47:45,340 --> 02:47:47,260
God, somebody buy the rights to this

1825
02:47:47,260 --> 02:47:48,540
so we can get a better version.

1826
02:47:50,600 --> 02:48:11,930
Ask Bill Gates.

1827
02:48:17,639 --> 02:48:20,200
Oh, God, I keep forgetting that's in here.

1828
02:48:20,760 --> 02:48:27,000
Oh, he is.

1829
02:48:32,629 --> 02:48:40,969
Okay, so now let's see what this...

1830
02:48:43,670 --> 02:48:47,340
Moves over here, that moves over here.

1831
02:48:48,299 --> 02:48:49,340
All right, almost done.

1832
02:48:54,680 --> 02:49:07,239
No, and I cannot bunch them together either, unfortunately.

1833
02:49:07,239 --> 02:49:10,920
I can't hit shift or control or alt.

1834
02:49:11,559 --> 02:49:13,319
You have to do it individually.

1835
02:49:20,809 --> 02:49:22,010
The music is overlapping,

1836
02:49:22,010 --> 02:49:24,010
but I don't think I can do anything about it.

1837
02:49:24,010 --> 02:49:25,579
How did I do this last time?

1838
02:49:51,159 --> 02:49:54,979
It's going to be further out.

1839
02:50:05,989 --> 02:50:25,540
This is nothing but fart and burp jokes.

1840
02:50:25,540 --> 02:50:28,420
I know, everybody pre-oppressed me in doing this.

1841
02:50:33,110 --> 02:50:33,909
I'm sorry.

1842
02:50:35,020 --> 02:50:35,659
And I wouldn't have...

1843
02:50:35,659 --> 02:50:37,020
You wouldn't have to see it so many times

1844
02:50:37,020 --> 02:50:38,860
if I didn't have to do this stupid shit

1845
02:50:38,860 --> 02:50:40,459
with the no undo button.

1846
02:50:47,989 --> 02:50:50,420
Getting closer.

1847
02:51:15,510 --> 02:51:15,989
I'm done.

1848
02:51:16,549 --> 02:51:17,829
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.

1849
02:51:17,829 --> 02:51:18,870
I'm out of this, we're gone.

1850
02:51:40,860 --> 02:51:45,219
He said to be moved a little bit.

1851
02:51:52,920 --> 02:51:53,239
Okay.

1852
02:51:54,760 --> 02:51:57,239
This goes forward, this goes forward, this goes forward.

1853
02:51:57,239 --> 02:51:58,040
We're ready.

1854
02:51:58,040 --> 02:51:58,520
Export.

1855
02:52:32,149 --> 02:52:34,250
Okay, goodbye.

1856
02:52:35,290 --> 02:52:37,129
Save the stupid movie.

1857
02:52:37,129 --> 02:52:38,969
Save, it saves, it's done.

1858
02:52:39,690 --> 02:52:40,250
I'm almost...

1859
02:52:40,250 --> 02:52:40,809
It's over.

1860
02:52:40,809 --> 02:52:42,969
It's time to export this piece of shit.

1861
02:53:30,760 --> 02:53:31,239
Don't waste...

1862
02:53:31,879 --> 02:53:33,079
He comes back to life again?

1863
02:53:33,719 --> 02:53:37,909
All right, that's it.

1864
02:53:37,909 --> 02:53:47,770
I'm done.

1865
02:53:50,040 --> 02:53:51,479
That's it, export the movie.

1866
02:53:51,479 --> 02:54:12,729
That looks good.

1867
02:54:12,729 --> 02:54:15,159
Bottom right.

1868
02:54:15,159 --> 02:54:16,440
Yeah, export movie.

1869
02:54:16,440 --> 02:54:18,280
How do I get rid of all this?

1870
02:54:18,280 --> 02:54:20,219
There's got to be a way I can cut that.

1871
02:54:20,219 --> 02:54:20,940
I just don't know.

1872
02:54:20,940 --> 02:54:25,319
All right, export movie.

1873
02:54:25,319 --> 02:54:27,159
If you want to have audio in your exported movie,

1874
02:54:27,159 --> 02:54:28,760
you must first update the soundtrack

1875
02:54:28,760 --> 02:54:30,600
by playing the movie from start to finish.

1876
02:54:30,600 --> 02:54:31,799
Do you want to do this now?

1877
02:55:11,540 --> 02:57:26,040
Hey, I remember how to play the...

1878
02:57:26,040 --> 02:57:27,559
I remember how to use the controls now.

1879
02:57:30,680 --> 02:57:33,899
Can I export the fucking movie now, please?

1880
02:57:38,409 --> 02:57:39,610
I already did that.

1881
02:57:39,610 --> 02:57:45,459
What are you talking about?

1882
02:57:45,459 --> 02:57:46,020
Wait, what?

1883
02:57:49,059 --> 02:57:51,219
Output name, high, highest.

1884
02:57:51,219 --> 02:57:57,750
Wait, what is this talking about?

1885
02:57:57,750 --> 02:57:59,590
Is this going to just save it to my computer?

1886
02:58:01,989 --> 02:58:03,030
I'm so confused.

1887
02:58:04,680 --> 02:58:05,399
Yeah, highest.

1888
02:58:09,079 --> 02:58:11,399
Oh my God, my like fucking stomach hurts.

1889
02:58:13,100 --> 02:58:15,340
It was like when he snaps his neck like twice.

1890
02:58:16,569 --> 02:58:18,090
It's just like so awful.

1891
02:58:18,090 --> 02:58:19,129
It's unnecessary.

1892
02:58:20,440 --> 02:58:21,719
All right, let's just get out of town.

1893
02:58:22,360 --> 02:58:32,020
Now it has like a vignette all over it too.

1894
02:58:38,860 --> 02:58:41,260
I actually am physically exporting this.

1895
02:58:52,100 --> 02:58:53,139
All right, now we're going to make...

1896
02:58:54,409 --> 02:58:55,690
I saw it in the chat earlier

1897
02:58:55,690 --> 02:58:58,090
and it is the thing that I want to make.

1898
02:58:58,090 --> 02:59:00,649
We're going to make constant conflict.

1899
02:59:00,649 --> 02:59:02,010
That is what I thought to make.

1900
02:59:15,850 --> 02:59:17,770
I do want to figure out a couple of things though.

1901
02:59:20,200 --> 02:59:22,200
Mainly free camera stuff.

1902
02:59:22,200 --> 02:59:25,209
Well, all right, it's been uploaded.

1903
02:59:26,969 --> 02:59:28,860
Save it.

1904
02:59:28,860 --> 02:59:30,059
And that's it, right?

1905
02:59:31,399 --> 02:59:34,569
Is this now all edited together?

1906
02:59:34,569 --> 02:59:35,129
I think it is.

1907
02:59:35,770 --> 02:59:40,020
So I just release it now.

1908
02:59:40,020 --> 02:59:40,739
Ready for release.

1909
02:59:41,299 --> 02:59:47,579
Let's see what they say.

1910
02:59:48,139 --> 02:59:54,309
Script quality is not very good.

1911
02:59:54,309 --> 02:59:54,870
It's all right.

1912
02:59:57,860 --> 02:59:59,059
I don't even want to watch it again.

1913
03:00:00,260 --> 03:00:01,219
I don't want to watch it again.

1914
03:00:01,860 --> 03:00:05,819
I don't want to watch it again.

1915
03:00:05,819 --> 03:00:41,510
No, we've already seen it.

1916
03:00:41,510 --> 03:00:46,069
We've already seen it.

1917
03:00:46,069 --> 03:00:53,299
We don't need to watch it a sixth time.

1918
03:00:53,299 --> 03:00:56,500
The crew was clueless, inexperienced cretins.

1919
03:00:59,180 --> 03:01:01,659
The overall quality of acting in this movie is appalling.

1920
03:01:02,520 --> 03:01:05,000
Howard's Poor Direction didn't do this movie any favors.

1921
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:06,360
Leo was shockingly bad.

1922
03:01:15,209 --> 03:01:16,569
Making money though, that's all that matters.

1923
03:01:19,850 --> 03:01:22,409
I need to can this because it's just kind of sitting here.

1924
03:01:23,690 --> 03:01:26,250
How do I just like get rid of this?

1925
03:01:26,969 --> 03:01:29,930
It's got to be like a throw, call it, can it.

1926
03:01:29,930 --> 03:01:32,700
There we go.

1927
03:01:32,700 --> 03:01:38,340
All right, let's do another one.

1928
03:01:39,079 --> 03:01:41,799
This one's going to be a little bit more elaborate.

1929
03:01:41,799 --> 03:01:42,680
We need some more sets.

1930
03:01:44,389 --> 03:01:51,610
Let's do cellar, war, battle.

1931
03:01:51,610 --> 03:01:52,649
I'm going to be a battlefield.

1932
03:01:53,290 --> 03:01:55,819
I'm going to make constant conflict.

1933
03:02:01,159 --> 03:02:05,239
Let's do a living room.

1934
03:02:11,670 --> 03:02:13,270
Going to need an office.

1935
03:02:17,049 --> 03:02:22,649
Going to need a traveling vehicle, automobile.

1936
03:02:28,920 --> 03:02:33,780
Wild west desert, wild west jail.

1937
03:02:34,659 --> 03:02:37,079
I already have the war battlefield in the street.

1938
03:02:38,440 --> 03:02:42,010
I already have the bathroom.

1939
03:02:45,030 --> 03:02:47,909
And a couple of years, time does have to pass.

1940
03:02:48,629 --> 03:02:53,209
Let's get the desert in here too.

1941
03:02:53,209 --> 03:02:54,329
I'm probably going to need it somehow.

1942
03:03:02,420 --> 03:03:06,569
All right, so we're going to start in the house.

1943
03:03:08,840 --> 03:03:15,000
So constant conflict is going to start opening in a regular group of friends.

1944
03:03:15,639 --> 03:03:19,620
Remember what happened in the beginning of Cloverfield?

1945
03:03:19,620 --> 03:03:21,620
Where it's just like, holy shit, something's going down.

1946
03:03:22,579 --> 03:03:24,120
I'm going to start here.

1947
03:03:24,920 --> 03:03:27,610
There's going to be like an earthquake and they're going to investigate the earthquake.

1948
03:03:27,610 --> 03:03:30,809
It's going to be like this fucking aliens invading and then they all have to have scars on their face.

1949
03:03:31,530 --> 03:03:35,290
Okay, what else do I need?

1950
03:03:35,290 --> 03:03:35,770
Anything else?

1951
03:03:39,139 --> 03:03:39,540
The bank?

1952
03:03:40,180 --> 03:03:42,469
Maybe just like a, just have them all.

1953
03:03:49,379 --> 03:03:50,739
Jail street.

1954
03:03:54,700 --> 03:03:55,659
Sci-fi star bridge.

1955
03:04:00,139 --> 03:04:01,659
Make an E3 conference.

1956
03:04:02,860 --> 03:04:06,520
I mean, good.

1957
03:04:06,520 --> 03:04:07,000
Cellar.

1958
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:07,479
All right.

1959
03:04:07,479 --> 03:04:08,520
I think we can work with this.

1960
03:04:10,040 --> 03:04:11,639
Make an E3 conference.

1961
03:04:13,860 --> 03:04:14,500
Do you want me to make it?

1962
03:04:17,219 --> 03:04:19,860
Constant conflict is probably going to take like the next two and a half hours.

1963
03:04:22,229 --> 03:04:24,389
I need like the blue screen.

1964
03:04:24,389 --> 03:04:32,649
We need time to go by because you can't start any...

1965
03:04:32,649 --> 03:04:34,649
I wish I could start in like 2000.

1966
03:04:35,610 --> 03:04:39,340
All right, I'll use my voice too.

1967
03:04:40,860 --> 03:04:42,139
We'll show some like...

1968
03:04:42,139 --> 03:04:43,180
No, no, no, no, no.

1969
03:04:43,180 --> 03:04:48,540
The game is constant conflict is the game that they're showing with E3.

1970
03:04:49,180 --> 03:04:53,219
But that makes sense, doesn't it?

1971
03:04:55,190 --> 03:04:56,149
But I need...

1972
03:04:56,149 --> 03:04:59,590
I know there's a blue screen, but I don't think I have it yet.

1973
03:05:01,510 --> 03:05:02,870
We're not in like the fucking...

1974
03:05:02,870 --> 03:05:03,829
We're in like the 50s.

1975
03:05:06,469 --> 03:05:08,709
You can edit the INI file to start in like 2000.

1976
03:05:19,260 --> 03:05:20,299
Yeah, I'll fast forward it.

1977
03:05:20,940 --> 03:05:22,219
Let me save it here and then I'm gonna...

1978
03:05:23,020 --> 03:05:25,559
Let me save game.

1979
03:05:25,559 --> 03:05:29,620
Just call it P Pants because that's the name of the studio.

1980
03:05:30,979 --> 03:05:34,899
I'm gonna edit the INI so we can actually be in the year 2000.

1981
03:05:36,780 --> 03:05:39,690
And then yeah, I'll bind undo as well.

1982
03:05:39,690 --> 03:05:42,250
I got a P, so I spent three hours.

1983
03:05:42,250 --> 03:05:43,209
I haven't gone to the bathroom.

1984
03:05:43,209 --> 03:05:44,010
I'll be right back.

1985
03:05:45,659 --> 03:05:52,920
And then when you come back, there will be the year 2000.

1986
03:05:54,680 --> 03:05:57,479
Blue screen, green screen, constant conflict.

1987
03:05:58,200 --> 03:05:59,079
I'll be back in a few minutes.

1988
03:10:08,340 --> 03:10:09,620
Okay, give me just a sec.

1989
03:10:11,540 --> 03:10:13,299
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1990
03:10:13,299 --> 03:10:15,299
Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.

1991
03:10:18,409 --> 03:10:19,450
Okay, INI file.

1992
03:10:20,170 --> 03:10:23,510
Let's get that open.

1993
03:10:24,229 --> 03:10:25,559
I got some water too.

1994
03:10:26,979 --> 03:10:27,860
I'm thirsty.

1995
03:10:30,729 --> 03:10:33,129
Okay, where do I do this?

1996
03:10:33,129 --> 03:10:34,649
I remember it's in a weird spot, isn't it?

1997
03:10:35,450 --> 03:10:47,000
Look for unlocking INI.

1998
03:10:49,030 --> 03:10:51,190
Unlocking INI.

1999
03:10:57,450 --> 03:10:59,780
Where the hell is that?

2000
03:11:02,149 --> 03:11:02,950
Let me see.

2001
03:11:02,950 --> 03:11:03,989
I gotta like look it up.

2002
03:11:08,870 --> 03:11:09,590
It's not here.

2003
03:11:15,299 --> 03:11:20,379
Data, scenario, scenes, text.

2004
03:11:21,579 --> 03:11:23,530
Where the hell is this?

2005
03:11:41,319 --> 03:11:43,079
I think it's the registry.

2006
03:11:43,079 --> 03:11:44,520
I think I could do it in the registry.

2007
03:11:56,329 --> 03:11:59,209
Yeah, I could allow any decade and change the value to one.

2008
03:12:00,170 --> 03:12:02,250
Let's hope this doesn't break.

2009
03:12:02,889 --> 03:12:10,899
Or is it in my documents file?

2010
03:12:10,899 --> 03:12:13,750
Oh, would that work?

2011
03:12:13,750 --> 03:12:14,149
Let's see.

2012
03:12:15,739 --> 03:12:17,340
I don't think, no, maybe it is right here.

2013
03:12:18,059 --> 03:12:19,500
All right, hold on.

2014
03:12:20,219 --> 03:12:24,440
I have to get out of town here.

2015
03:12:25,000 --> 03:12:30,899
No, it's not here.

2016
03:12:35,940 --> 03:12:38,979
Oh, I can't really go searching for this right now.

2017
03:12:39,780 --> 03:12:41,860
I definitely have enough to do what I want to do.

2018
03:12:42,889 --> 03:12:46,729
At least for, let me see.

2019
03:12:49,260 --> 03:12:51,340
Anybody offhand of any idea where this is?

2020
03:12:51,899 --> 03:12:56,170
Because I don't see it anywhere.

2021
03:12:56,170 --> 03:12:57,290
Or do I have to make one?

2022
03:12:58,010 --> 03:12:59,690
The text document, you know what I'm saying?

2023
03:13:00,409 --> 03:13:03,370
It's in the documents.

2024
03:13:03,370 --> 03:13:04,969
I'm in my documents right now.

2025
03:13:04,969 --> 03:13:06,969
The movies, and I don't see anything.

2026
03:13:06,969 --> 03:13:11,750
I see save games, movie sounds, graphics.

2027
03:13:12,469 --> 03:13:19,110
And maybe an app data.

2028
03:13:19,110 --> 03:13:19,829
That's possible.

2029
03:13:19,829 --> 03:13:20,229
Hold on.

2030
03:13:20,950 --> 03:13:30,569
There's Lionhead, the movies.

2031
03:13:31,450 --> 03:13:33,750
There's an OS detect.

2032
03:13:35,030 --> 03:13:36,229
This is not an I&I.

2033
03:13:37,750 --> 03:13:37,989
Shit.

2034
03:13:44,520 --> 03:13:46,600
I'm in app data right now and there's no

2035
03:13:48,739 --> 03:13:51,059
Lionhead studios in app data roaming.

2036
03:14:00,700 --> 03:14:01,739
Yeah, it's not in here.

2037
03:14:01,739 --> 03:14:03,180
Unless it's, is it hidden?

2038
03:14:10,020 --> 03:14:12,340
I've got an unlocking.ini there for me.

2039
03:14:13,299 --> 03:14:15,579
Why do I, how come I don't have one?

2040
03:14:16,219 --> 03:14:27,079
Let me like, see if I can, is it hidden?

2041
03:14:27,799 --> 03:14:35,219
Maybe it's a hidden file.

2042
03:14:38,620 --> 03:14:41,260
It's not a, it's not a hidden file for me.

2043
03:14:41,260 --> 03:14:42,860
Show hidden files and folders.

2044
03:14:42,860 --> 03:14:43,899
Where the fuck is it then?

2045
03:14:47,350 --> 03:14:49,430
Yeah, I have hidden files showing right now.

2046
03:14:59,780 --> 03:15:02,180
I'm gonna have to get this done like off stream.

2047
03:15:02,180 --> 03:15:03,700
So I, because this, it's not here.

2048
03:15:05,139 --> 03:15:08,840
Once I unload all the mods on the next stream for this game.

2049
03:15:15,719 --> 03:15:17,239
Either that or I have to edit the registry

2050
03:15:17,239 --> 03:15:18,840
and I feel like I'll break the fucking whole game.

2051
03:15:25,700 --> 03:15:27,459
It's a hidden file in app data.

2052
03:15:27,459 --> 03:15:28,500
That's where I am right now.

2053
03:15:29,299 --> 03:15:34,020
I have, I'm in app data, I'm in Lionhead studios

2054
03:15:34,020 --> 03:15:36,979
and the only thing that's there with hidden files turned on

2055
03:15:38,120 --> 03:15:42,440
is this file that says OS detect, that's it.

2056
03:15:44,920 --> 03:15:46,120
Well, I'll try the registry thing

2057
03:15:46,120 --> 03:15:48,760
but I might have to remake the whole game.

2058
03:15:48,760 --> 03:15:49,159
Let's see.

2059
03:15:51,420 --> 03:15:52,379
I'll do the registry.

2060
03:15:53,100 --> 03:15:55,260
If this doesn't work then I'll have to get it done

2061
03:15:55,260 --> 03:15:56,780
for when we put the mods in.

2062
03:16:00,819 --> 03:16:04,979
All right, it is in, I'm there in the movies.

2063
03:16:09,459 --> 03:16:13,620
Allow any decade is about to be turned into one.

2064
03:16:13,620 --> 03:16:14,819
The value is one.

2065
03:16:15,620 --> 03:16:19,750
Let's see if that worked.

2066
03:16:20,469 --> 03:16:24,360
If I have to start a new game I might have to

2067
03:16:25,159 --> 03:16:29,959
because I think I have to pick the decade unfortunately.

2068
03:16:30,520 --> 03:16:32,309
Let's give it a try.

2069
03:16:33,030 --> 03:16:47,299
All right, here we go.

2070
03:16:47,299 --> 03:16:49,620
Let's see if it works.

2071
03:16:57,579 --> 03:17:00,709
Set it to two and break everything.

2072
03:17:05,399 --> 03:17:10,379
Oh, okay.

2073
03:17:14,629 --> 03:17:16,629
Yeah, I'm gonna have to,

2074
03:17:16,629 --> 03:17:18,309
I think I'm gonna have to do another one

2075
03:17:18,309 --> 03:17:21,159
because see, watch this ready.

2076
03:17:21,159 --> 03:17:26,649
Yeah, I have to start another one.

2077
03:17:26,649 --> 03:17:28,250
Unfortunately, we have to.

2078
03:17:28,250 --> 03:17:35,000
It's all right though, it's not,

2079
03:17:35,000 --> 03:17:39,989
that's not any time at all.

2080
03:17:39,989 --> 03:17:41,750
I have the same actors and everything so don't worry.

2081
03:17:46,200 --> 03:18:01,590
They can misbehave, that's fine.

2082
03:18:01,590 --> 03:18:12,600
A hundred million dollars, that's right.

2083
03:18:12,600 --> 03:18:14,440
All right, just got to bring everybody back.

2084
03:18:16,969 --> 03:18:20,250
All right, let's go.

2085
03:18:20,250 --> 03:18:25,290
I need a import, bring them all back in.

2086
03:18:32,950 --> 03:18:37,239
Sandler, somebody has to be a director, right?

2087
03:18:40,149 --> 03:18:42,389
And I need import star.

2088
03:18:42,389 --> 03:18:44,069
I need to know who else.

2089
03:18:44,069 --> 03:18:47,860
All right, who's the director for you?

2090
03:18:53,930 --> 03:18:55,370
No sound, sorry.

2091
03:18:55,370 --> 03:18:56,329
I had to mute it.

2092
03:18:56,329 --> 03:19:04,250
All right, we got a director.

2093
03:19:04,250 --> 03:19:05,209
We have our actors.

2094
03:19:05,770 --> 03:19:07,610
Let's go.

2095
03:19:07,610 --> 03:19:11,020
Data talent's on YouTube already.

2096
03:19:12,020 --> 03:19:13,540
How the hell did you do it that fast?

2097
03:19:14,180 --> 03:19:16,469
So now, look at this.

2098
03:19:17,270 --> 03:19:18,069
There we are.

2099
03:19:20,760 --> 03:19:26,040
Field, graveyard, must be, alien world, stage.

2100
03:19:26,760 --> 03:19:30,180
Suburban bathroom, suburban living room.

2101
03:19:31,450 --> 03:19:32,889
All right, so suburban living room.

2102
03:19:33,930 --> 03:19:34,889
Suburban living room.

2103
03:19:41,829 --> 03:19:44,149
My first movie was pirated instantly.

2104
03:19:50,459 --> 03:19:51,579
Alien world.

2105
03:19:56,329 --> 03:20:01,319
Let's get stage for our E3 presentation.

2106
03:20:01,319 --> 03:20:04,200
Stage, I believe you can put a green screen behind it.

2107
03:20:07,370 --> 03:20:09,209
Suburban street is another one.

2108
03:20:09,930 --> 03:20:13,270
You have to have like the chaos.

2109
03:20:13,909 --> 03:20:19,700
Then we need only a few more things.

2110
03:20:20,659 --> 03:20:22,680
Tropical beach, why not?

2111
03:20:32,100 --> 03:20:35,290
Alleyway, bar, yeah, we want a bar.

2112
03:20:36,489 --> 03:20:37,450
I wanted a lot of things.

2113
03:20:37,450 --> 03:20:38,090
I want everything.

2114
03:20:41,780 --> 03:20:45,940
Rooftop for the inevitable chase scene.

2115
03:20:49,239 --> 03:20:54,149
Subway carriage, hotel room, subway station.

2116
03:20:55,819 --> 03:20:56,940
There's a lot of sets.

2117
03:20:57,959 --> 03:21:00,040
We got unlimited money though, so it doesn't matter.

2118
03:21:00,040 --> 03:21:08,760
Battlefield, we need this too for when we fight the aliens.

2119
03:21:09,879 --> 03:21:13,479
Yeah, I'm really going big here, but you know what's going to happen.

2120
03:21:13,479 --> 03:21:16,040
There's going to be like a fucking neck snap and then a fart sound.

2121
03:21:17,079 --> 03:21:18,840
And then somebody like falls down or something.

2122
03:21:18,840 --> 03:21:20,440
You think this is going to be a big elaborate movie.

2123
03:21:21,079 --> 03:21:25,239
I'm out of space.

2124
03:21:25,239 --> 03:21:26,600
I feel like I can move shit around.

2125
03:21:27,239 --> 03:21:27,719
Hold on.

2126
03:21:30,579 --> 03:21:31,860
Move rehab out of the way.

2127
03:21:32,500 --> 03:21:38,549
I think I need like a builder.

2128
03:21:38,549 --> 03:21:39,430
No, this is good.

2129
03:21:39,430 --> 03:21:39,909
This is good.

2130
03:21:39,909 --> 03:21:40,389
This is good.

2131
03:21:40,950 --> 03:21:41,989
There's plenty.

2132
03:21:41,989 --> 03:21:43,959
I got like the alien world.

2133
03:21:43,959 --> 03:21:44,360
I've got...

2134
03:21:45,000 --> 03:21:48,360
I can't fit that right here.

2135
03:21:48,360 --> 03:21:48,680
I can't.

2136
03:21:48,680 --> 03:21:49,159
Okay, good.

2137
03:21:49,879 --> 03:21:50,280
One more.

2138
03:22:03,299 --> 03:22:03,620
Shit.

2139
03:22:05,030 --> 03:22:05,270
All right.

2140
03:22:05,270 --> 03:22:05,750
No, that's good.

2141
03:22:05,750 --> 03:22:05,989
That's good.

2142
03:22:05,989 --> 03:22:06,309
That's fine.

2143
03:22:06,309 --> 03:22:07,030
That's fine.

2144
03:22:07,030 --> 03:22:08,149
Just get rid of the rehab.

2145
03:22:08,870 --> 03:22:15,530
No, this is all right.

2146
03:22:15,530 --> 03:22:18,329
This is all right.

2147
03:22:18,329 --> 03:22:19,770
Okay, here we go.

2148
03:22:20,409 --> 03:22:21,129
Custom script.

2149
03:22:22,659 --> 03:22:24,180
I need the custom script office.

2150
03:22:26,520 --> 03:22:29,530
I also need a post-production office.

2151
03:22:30,809 --> 03:22:32,629
All right.

2152
03:22:32,629 --> 03:22:33,510
No, I already have one.

2153
03:22:33,510 --> 03:22:36,979
Okay, here we go.

2154
03:22:38,899 --> 03:22:39,459
It's time.

2155
03:22:39,459 --> 03:22:44,250
The name of this movie.

2156
03:22:45,290 --> 03:22:46,489
This is an action movie.

2157
03:22:48,659 --> 03:22:51,260
Well, actually, I don't know.

2158
03:22:51,260 --> 03:22:52,299
This is E3.

2159
03:22:53,260 --> 03:22:54,459
It would be an action movie, right?

2160
03:22:59,819 --> 03:23:01,020
Okay, let's do...

2161
03:23:01,020 --> 03:23:11,079
We need to have the person presenting.

2162
03:23:11,799 --> 03:23:13,000
Let's have this be...

2163
03:23:20,899 --> 03:23:22,920
This can be Adam Sandler.

2164
03:23:23,559 --> 03:23:27,319
I said we need to change this to a better outfit.

2165
03:23:28,040 --> 03:23:29,659
No, that's not...

2166
03:23:29,659 --> 03:23:30,379
This is better.

2167
03:23:30,379 --> 03:23:41,579
It comes out in pinstripes.

2168
03:23:42,219 --> 03:23:43,579
I like that a little better.

2169
03:23:44,969 --> 03:23:46,090
I like that a little better.

2170
03:23:58,500 --> 03:24:04,120
No, no, no latex heads.

2171
03:24:04,760 --> 03:24:09,370
This is fine.

2172
03:24:12,739 --> 03:24:13,059
All right.

2173
03:24:13,059 --> 03:24:13,459
No, no.

2174
03:24:13,459 --> 03:24:14,020
This is fine.

2175
03:24:14,020 --> 03:24:14,899
This is just a suit.

2176
03:24:16,739 --> 03:24:20,700
Eye, makeup, shape, facial hair, na...

2177
03:24:20,700 --> 03:24:20,860
All right.

2178
03:24:20,860 --> 03:24:21,420
This is fine.

2179
03:24:28,940 --> 03:24:30,139
And then this is...

2180
03:24:31,020 --> 03:24:38,069
Commander...

2181
03:24:40,659 --> 03:24:42,020
We got to have a little...

2182
03:24:42,020 --> 03:24:42,579
A story here.

2183
03:24:42,579 --> 03:24:42,979
We have...

2184
03:24:47,719 --> 03:24:48,520
No, no, no.

2185
03:24:48,520 --> 03:24:51,079
The studio head is the person that's presenting E3.

2186
03:24:51,079 --> 03:24:52,280
We have to have a main character.

2187
03:24:52,280 --> 03:24:53,319
There's two games to show.

2188
03:24:55,780 --> 03:24:59,260
Leo as Captain...

2189
03:25:00,709 --> 03:25:01,829
Or like Grunge.

2190
03:25:02,790 --> 03:25:10,299
What's like a hard name?

2191
03:25:10,299 --> 03:25:12,299
Like Rick Grunge or something.

2192
03:25:16,469 --> 03:25:17,110
No, no, no, no.

2193
03:25:20,629 --> 03:25:21,190
Rock like...

2194
03:25:23,639 --> 03:25:24,360
Rock hard...

2195
03:25:25,319 --> 03:25:33,500
Rock hurdman?

2196
03:25:33,500 --> 03:25:34,700
Rock hard...

2197
03:25:37,190 --> 03:25:37,829
Never mind.

2198
03:25:38,790 --> 03:25:39,030
Rock...

2199
03:25:45,459 --> 03:25:46,260
Rocky Rick?

2200
03:25:51,059 --> 03:25:51,379
Rock...

2201
03:25:52,260 --> 03:26:07,590
Don...

2202
03:26:07,590 --> 03:26:08,549
Don...

2203
03:26:08,549 --> 03:26:09,510
Don Rock?

2204
03:26:09,510 --> 03:26:12,149
Commander Don Rock.

2205
03:26:12,149 --> 03:26:13,750
Commander Donald Rock.

2206
03:26:13,750 --> 03:26:23,270
No, this is just Don the Rock.

2207
03:26:23,270 --> 03:26:24,069
Like, no.

2208
03:26:24,069 --> 03:26:24,549
No, no, no.

2209
03:26:24,549 --> 03:26:25,110
No Rock.

2210
03:26:50,389 --> 03:26:52,659
I'm not going to...

2211
03:26:52,659 --> 03:26:53,620
No, not that one.

2212
03:26:53,620 --> 03:27:00,969
Kurt...

2213
03:27:01,530 --> 03:27:03,219
Kurt Frightener?

2214
03:27:03,219 --> 03:27:05,530
Kurt Frightener.

2215
03:27:05,530 --> 03:27:09,590
Command...

2216
03:27:09,590 --> 03:27:15,700
Commander Kurt Frightener.

2217
03:27:15,700 --> 03:27:16,979
Yeah, and it's going to be...

2218
03:27:16,979 --> 03:27:23,530
It's going to be Jax.

2219
03:27:23,530 --> 03:27:25,770
We also need like an alien.

2220
03:27:25,770 --> 03:27:28,010
But I think we can have some extras be aliens, right?

2221
03:27:28,010 --> 03:27:37,430
So we've got Jax and I'm saying Leo can be here.

2222
03:27:41,540 --> 03:27:43,540
Also, we need to change your costume.

2223
03:27:43,540 --> 03:27:44,899
Because that's not what you're going to be wearing.

2224
03:27:48,459 --> 03:27:52,840
It's going to be in one of these outfits that looks cool.

2225
03:27:53,719 --> 03:27:54,920
Not a clown costume.

2226
03:27:55,959 --> 03:27:56,600
Sorry, guys.

2227
03:27:58,600 --> 03:28:04,579
Is he just like a cop?

2228
03:28:04,579 --> 03:28:05,379
No, is there...

2229
03:28:05,379 --> 03:28:06,180
Is it like a marine?

2230
03:28:06,180 --> 03:28:07,139
Like a space marine?

2231
03:28:08,020 --> 03:28:23,579
Invisible ghost?

2232
03:28:23,579 --> 03:28:30,059
Here we go.

2233
03:28:30,059 --> 03:28:31,020
This is not bad.

2234
03:28:31,020 --> 03:28:40,940
No, but this is just like his day as the space marine commander or something.

2235
03:28:40,940 --> 03:28:43,659
Space suit.

2236
03:28:43,659 --> 03:28:44,940
Okay, so that's all right.

2237
03:28:47,190 --> 03:28:48,389
That's a good starting costume.

2238
03:28:50,340 --> 03:28:50,979
Swedish.

2239
03:28:52,420 --> 03:28:53,940
Swedish space marine.

2240
03:28:55,879 --> 03:28:58,280
And then this has to be an alien of some sort.

2241
03:28:58,280 --> 03:29:04,250
Okay, let's go with...

2242
03:29:05,049 --> 03:29:05,530
Back here.

2243
03:29:06,889 --> 03:29:09,299
I could do like monsters, right?

2244
03:29:15,620 --> 03:29:18,649
I mean, I kind of like it.

2245
03:29:18,649 --> 03:29:21,930
This is like an enemy you would be shooting at in like Doom, right?

2246
03:29:27,799 --> 03:29:29,239
Okay, this is the E3 presentation.

2247
03:29:29,879 --> 03:29:31,670
Here is the studio head.

2248
03:29:31,670 --> 03:29:32,629
We've got Kurt Frightener.

2249
03:29:34,260 --> 03:29:34,899
Kurt Vicks, no.

2250
03:29:35,620 --> 03:29:39,459
They always have something like outrageous like...

2251
03:29:45,670 --> 03:29:48,149
Like Warlord Kleksis or something.

2252
03:29:48,149 --> 03:29:58,739
They always have to have like two Xs in their name.

2253
03:29:58,739 --> 03:29:59,700
Warlord Kleks.

2254
03:30:03,850 --> 03:30:04,329
Sounds good.

2255
03:30:07,829 --> 03:30:11,959
All right, here we go.

2256
03:30:11,959 --> 03:30:13,559
So our presentation begins.

2257
03:30:15,219 --> 03:30:21,879
We need a stage.

2258
03:30:21,879 --> 03:30:24,120
Which where is it?

2259
03:30:24,120 --> 03:30:24,520
Stage.

2260
03:30:27,850 --> 03:30:29,530
And this is just static.

2261
03:30:29,530 --> 03:30:33,590
We got to get in here.

2262
03:30:36,309 --> 03:30:38,149
I don't know what you all are doing here.

2263
03:30:38,709 --> 03:30:40,549
I don't know why there are these people here.

2264
03:30:41,350 --> 03:30:42,489
But we need a backdrop.

2265
03:30:42,489 --> 03:30:43,930
We need to change the set.

2266
03:30:45,799 --> 03:30:46,600
Not a household.

2267
03:30:46,600 --> 03:30:47,399
We want it to be...

2268
03:30:48,280 --> 03:30:49,299
I don't know.

2269
03:30:49,299 --> 03:30:50,739
We got to change the background.

2270
03:30:50,739 --> 03:30:53,030
Where is it here?

2271
03:30:53,030 --> 03:30:53,829
Change backdrop.

2272
03:30:53,829 --> 03:30:54,229
There it is.

2273
03:30:59,659 --> 03:31:00,219
Forest.

2274
03:31:00,219 --> 03:31:07,829
Is it just like a road?

2275
03:31:07,829 --> 03:31:17,000
There isn't just like a computer screen or like a green screen?

2276
03:31:17,639 --> 03:31:22,940
I thought they had that.

2277
03:31:26,100 --> 03:31:26,579
I thought they did.

2278
03:31:26,579 --> 03:31:27,299
I thought they had that.

2279
03:31:36,780 --> 03:31:37,420
Alleyway.

2280
03:31:41,290 --> 03:31:42,219
Could be this.

2281
03:31:42,379 --> 03:31:44,620
Although, I don't know why this is all here.

2282
03:31:44,620 --> 03:31:45,579
Can you all go away?

2283
03:31:46,780 --> 03:31:51,290
None of you have to be here.

2284
03:31:52,489 --> 03:31:56,200
E3 in the alleyway.

2285
03:31:57,079 --> 03:31:58,440
All right, we're going to do a stat...

2286
03:31:58,440 --> 03:32:04,979
Okay, first of all, I need to find out how to move this camera freeform.

2287
03:32:05,780 --> 03:32:06,579
Let me see this.

2288
03:32:06,579 --> 03:32:09,989
Viewing your scene.

2289
03:32:09,989 --> 03:32:11,190
Pause sliders.

2290
03:32:11,909 --> 03:32:15,000
Choosing scenes.

2291
03:32:15,719 --> 03:32:16,440
Searching for a scene.

2292
03:32:16,440 --> 03:32:25,420
No, no, no.

2293
03:32:25,420 --> 03:32:26,059
I know how to do all this.

2294
03:32:26,059 --> 03:32:28,139
I just want to keep the camera static somewhere.

2295
03:32:28,139 --> 03:32:29,260
All right, so where was...

2296
03:32:29,260 --> 03:32:42,069
This is an E3.

2297
03:32:42,709 --> 03:32:44,389
Who is it?

2298
03:32:44,389 --> 03:32:44,709
Jax?

2299
03:32:47,700 --> 03:32:50,659
Yeah, I know if I don't put anybody here, they're not going to show up.

2300
03:32:50,659 --> 03:32:53,059
Mannequins mean that they're just available.

2301
03:32:53,860 --> 03:32:55,379
Do I have the DLC installed?

2302
03:32:55,379 --> 03:32:56,819
I should, yeah.

2303
03:32:56,819 --> 03:32:58,469
Let me like just find out.

2304
03:32:58,469 --> 03:32:59,590
Let me make sure I have that.

2305
03:33:00,739 --> 03:33:01,459
It's installed.

2306
03:33:02,659 --> 03:33:04,500
I'm using the EXE for that.

2307
03:33:06,139 --> 03:33:06,620
You know what I'm saying?

2308
03:33:06,620 --> 03:33:07,500
Like is that...

2309
03:33:07,500 --> 03:33:08,299
What's going on here?

2310
03:33:15,260 --> 03:33:16,540
Why do I not have any stunt scenes?

2311
03:33:17,100 --> 03:33:24,840
Doesn't...

2312
03:33:24,840 --> 03:33:25,719
Wait, why is it...

2313
03:33:25,719 --> 03:33:26,680
Why would this not be installed?

2314
03:33:27,479 --> 03:33:28,139
I have the...

2315
03:33:28,219 --> 03:33:29,979
Yeah, I have the expansion installed.

2316
03:33:29,979 --> 03:33:32,700
How does it make any sense?

2317
03:33:41,639 --> 03:33:42,200
Wait, what?

2318
03:33:47,559 --> 03:33:48,600
No, I should be opening...

2319
03:33:48,600 --> 03:33:50,200
I should have the right game open.

2320
03:33:50,200 --> 03:33:54,549
I mean, I literally have the disc literally in my hand.

2321
03:33:58,780 --> 03:34:01,340
You have to enable stunts and effects on the campaign,

2322
03:34:01,340 --> 03:34:02,540
but this is just sandbox mode.

2323
03:34:09,799 --> 03:34:10,200
Hold on.

2324
03:34:10,760 --> 03:34:11,399
Back out of here.

2325
03:34:15,420 --> 03:34:16,780
This is very confusing to me.

2326
03:34:19,829 --> 03:34:22,229
Do I have to have like a stunt section?

2327
03:34:24,979 --> 03:34:25,700
Hold on a minute.

2328
03:34:27,540 --> 03:34:31,379
Weird.

2329
03:34:31,379 --> 03:34:33,139
Like do I have to hire a stuntman?

2330
03:34:33,780 --> 03:34:36,180
I don't remember this happening.

2331
03:34:36,180 --> 03:34:37,219
This is kind of fucked up.

2332
03:34:37,940 --> 03:34:49,319
Maybe it's no stunts for this scene,

2333
03:34:49,959 --> 03:34:51,879
but I don't think they were available in the other one either.

2334
03:34:51,879 --> 03:34:52,280
Hold on.

2335
03:34:53,540 --> 03:34:55,459
I know there's stunts for some of these,

2336
03:34:55,459 --> 03:34:56,579
like the bank for instance.

2337
03:34:59,209 --> 03:35:00,250
Yeah, wouldn't it be here?

2338
03:35:01,129 --> 03:35:01,850
I swear to God.

2339
03:35:01,850 --> 03:35:02,969
Would they have like a different...

2340
03:35:04,629 --> 03:35:06,229
They have a different thing on the thumbnail, don't they?

2341
03:35:10,180 --> 03:35:12,260
Yeah, there's different scene thumbnails.

2342
03:35:19,739 --> 03:35:21,260
Like there's definitely stunts here.

2343
03:35:21,260 --> 03:35:22,940
I'm very, very, very confused.

2344
03:35:23,579 --> 03:35:25,770
Back to the menu.

2345
03:35:36,149 --> 03:35:37,190
Back up for a second.

2346
03:35:37,190 --> 03:35:38,790
What the fuck is going on here?

2347
03:35:38,790 --> 03:35:47,659
This is fine.

2348
03:35:47,659 --> 03:35:48,540
We can just do it again.

2349
03:35:59,979 --> 03:36:00,139
No.

2350
03:36:01,739 --> 03:36:02,459
What the fuck?

2351
03:36:02,459 --> 03:36:03,100
Hold on a second.

2352
03:36:03,100 --> 03:36:03,819
It's not even here.

2353
03:36:04,790 --> 03:36:05,190
Why is it...

2354
03:36:05,190 --> 03:36:06,709
Why do I not have the expansion?

2355
03:36:09,909 --> 03:36:10,149
What?

2356
03:36:14,409 --> 03:36:15,610
I'm so confused.

2357
03:36:24,170 --> 03:36:24,569
What?

2358
03:36:32,600 --> 03:36:33,079
I don't think...

2359
03:36:34,120 --> 03:36:34,920
Let me try this.

2360
03:36:35,559 --> 03:36:42,100
Yeah, there's a movies...

2361
03:36:45,879 --> 03:36:47,879
Something broke here when I installed it.

2362
03:36:47,879 --> 03:36:48,780
God damn it.

2363
03:36:48,780 --> 03:36:48,940
No.

2364
03:36:49,500 --> 03:36:57,530
This is gonna work?

2365
03:36:57,530 --> 03:37:05,180
No, I have the patch.

2366
03:37:05,659 --> 03:37:08,040
Oh, come on.

2367
03:37:08,040 --> 03:37:08,920
Don't do this to me now.

2368
03:37:09,559 --> 03:37:14,379
Yeah, I was wondering because some things were just missing,

2369
03:37:14,379 --> 03:37:15,739
but I installed them both.

2370
03:37:17,500 --> 03:37:19,659
I'm launching it from the expansion EXE,

2371
03:37:19,659 --> 03:37:22,059
and it's telling me like it's not installed properly somehow.

2372
03:37:22,620 --> 03:37:24,700
Fuck me.

2373
03:37:24,700 --> 03:37:25,819
Don't tell me this is gonna happen.

2374
03:37:26,379 --> 03:37:33,559
That makes no sense.

2375
03:37:42,069 --> 03:37:43,750
I thought this was ready to go to.

2376
03:37:43,750 --> 03:37:44,229
Fuck me.

2377
03:37:44,950 --> 03:37:51,860
I was really looking forward to it too,

2378
03:37:51,860 --> 03:37:53,780
but apparently I don't know why this won't work.

2379
03:38:08,729 --> 03:38:13,500
I'm so confused.

2380
03:38:13,500 --> 03:38:15,500
Is there a way that I could see inside

2381
03:38:15,500 --> 03:38:17,420
of why this would be happening like this?

2382
03:38:17,420 --> 03:38:20,260
Like inside the actual data?

2383
03:38:20,260 --> 03:38:29,750
Like inside the actual folder for the game?

2384
03:38:29,750 --> 03:38:31,500
Is there a way I can see?

2385
03:38:31,500 --> 03:38:34,059
Like if the stunt stuff is installed in there?

2386
03:38:34,700 --> 03:38:39,350
Like a certain file or something?

2387
03:38:39,350 --> 03:38:40,309
Well, let me put this up.

2388
03:38:49,750 --> 03:38:51,110
This is so fucking frustrating.

2389
03:38:53,260 --> 03:38:53,979
It actually is.

2390
03:39:08,579 --> 03:39:11,739
Looks like it should be in there.

2391
03:39:11,739 --> 03:39:13,340
The stunt should have his own folder.

2392
03:39:13,340 --> 03:39:16,059
Yeah, that's what I was thinking too, but why?

2393
03:39:16,059 --> 03:39:21,260
No fucking idea.

2394
03:39:21,260 --> 03:39:22,540
Let me see what happens when I do this.

2395
03:39:27,540 --> 03:39:28,899
I might have to reinstall it then.

2396
03:39:37,719 --> 03:39:39,000
I wonder what happened.

2397
03:39:39,000 --> 03:39:41,479
Because I went through the process of installing it normally,

2398
03:39:41,479 --> 03:39:42,889
and it said it was done.

2399
03:39:54,889 --> 03:39:58,629
What a way to take the fucking wind out of my sales game.

2400
03:39:58,629 --> 03:40:08,950
Let me take a look at this.

2401
03:40:09,510 --> 03:40:15,100
Yeah, I have no idea.

2402
03:40:15,819 --> 03:40:18,629
I'm going to try something real quick and see what happens.

2403
03:40:18,629 --> 03:40:20,069
I'm going to run like the...

2404
03:40:20,069 --> 03:40:23,430
I'm going to reinstall the stunts and effects.

2405
03:40:23,430 --> 03:40:31,739
Setup has detected that you already have

2406
03:40:31,739 --> 03:40:36,120
the movie stunts and effects installed.

2407
03:40:36,120 --> 03:40:38,200
Well, what the fuck are you talking about?

2408
03:40:38,760 --> 03:40:43,670
What the fuck is happening, man?

2409
03:40:48,170 --> 03:40:50,649
I'm just going to run it from the disk and see what happens.

2410
03:40:50,649 --> 03:41:04,790
Like will it open from here?

2411
03:41:04,790 --> 03:41:06,870
Because maybe the EXE is fucked up.

2412
03:41:07,350 --> 03:41:18,090
This is beyond anything that I could ever imagine would be wrong.

2413
03:41:19,370 --> 03:41:20,729
Yeah, I'm running as administrator.

2414
03:41:20,729 --> 03:41:21,370
I don't understand.

2415
03:41:27,260 --> 03:41:32,200
Fuck me.

2416
03:41:32,920 --> 03:41:37,239
I need a no CD.

2417
03:41:37,239 --> 03:41:38,520
Yeah, I have the no CD.

2418
03:41:38,520 --> 03:41:40,040
That's what's the weird part about this.

2419
03:41:42,280 --> 03:41:55,510
I have the no CD already, and it's the right one.

2420
03:41:55,510 --> 03:42:06,700
Let me just see something here.

2421
03:42:12,329 --> 03:42:19,909
For the purposes of just...

2422
03:42:19,909 --> 03:42:22,309
I just don't want to sit here and try to...

2423
03:42:23,030 --> 03:42:28,379
Mmm.

2424
03:42:28,379 --> 03:42:32,709
Let me try one thing.

2425
03:42:48,579 --> 03:42:49,299
Stunts and effects.

2426
03:42:51,700 --> 03:42:52,340
Yeah, no CD.

2427
03:42:52,340 --> 03:42:53,139
I have the right one.

2428
03:42:53,780 --> 03:42:56,120
I don't know why it's doing this.

2429
03:43:11,799 --> 03:43:12,280
All right.

2430
03:43:12,280 --> 03:43:16,180
Well, I'm going to have to just either go...

2431
03:43:17,379 --> 03:43:18,579
I kind of don't know what to do.

2432
03:43:22,940 --> 03:43:34,469
Pray that this works.

2433
03:43:34,469 --> 03:43:42,260
Pray that this works.

2434
03:43:42,260 --> 03:43:43,540
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2435
03:43:43,540 --> 03:43:44,020
Did it work?

2436
03:43:44,020 --> 03:43:44,420
Did it work?

2437
03:43:44,420 --> 03:43:44,819
Did it work?

2438
03:43:44,819 --> 03:43:45,700
Did it work?

2439
03:43:45,700 --> 03:43:47,909
Did it work?

2440
03:43:47,909 --> 03:43:59,930
Did it work?

2441
03:43:59,930 --> 03:44:00,329
Work?

2442
03:44:01,510 --> 03:44:01,909
Yes!

2443
03:44:08,420 --> 03:44:09,059
It worked!

2444
03:44:11,659 --> 03:44:12,379
All right.

2445
03:44:12,379 --> 03:44:13,899
Why the fuck was that so...

2446
03:44:13,899 --> 03:44:15,579
That makes no sense.

2447
03:44:15,579 --> 03:44:25,979
I wish I had even a percent of explanation as to why this has happened.

2448
03:44:25,979 --> 03:44:26,940
Holy shit, guys.

2449
03:44:26,940 --> 03:44:28,139
That made no sense.

2450
03:44:28,139 --> 03:44:31,590
Take a look.

2451
03:44:31,590 --> 03:44:32,709
We're good.

2452
03:44:32,709 --> 03:44:42,229
Although you guys can't see now, though.

2453
03:44:42,229 --> 03:44:42,790
Why can't you...

2454
03:44:42,790 --> 03:44:44,069
Come on, capture this shit, man.

2455
03:44:44,069 --> 03:44:44,870
Don't do this now.

2456
03:44:44,870 --> 03:44:45,829
Come on, hurry up.

2457
03:44:45,829 --> 03:44:46,309
Let's go.

2458
03:44:49,610 --> 03:44:50,729
I got it on my screen.

2459
03:44:51,370 --> 03:44:51,930
Capture!

2460
03:44:54,709 --> 03:44:56,389
Capture, you piece of crap!

2461
03:44:56,950 --> 03:44:59,799
Stop putting up hurdles!

2462
03:44:59,799 --> 03:45:01,399
I want to make a movie!

2463
03:45:15,610 --> 03:45:16,729
What are you doing now?

2464
03:45:17,899 --> 03:45:18,620
It won't pull.

2465
03:45:18,620 --> 03:45:20,379
It won't capture it now.

2466
03:45:20,379 --> 03:45:21,420
Of course not.

2467
03:45:21,420 --> 03:45:26,729
Give me a fucking break.

2468
03:45:26,729 --> 03:45:28,569
Oh my god, computers suck.

2469
03:45:32,620 --> 03:45:34,219
Let me just try capturing the window.

2470
03:45:49,979 --> 03:45:51,340
Now it won't pull it.

2471
03:45:51,340 --> 03:45:52,379
Now it won't capture it.

2472
03:45:52,940 --> 03:45:54,139
It's playing, but I can't...

2473
03:45:54,139 --> 03:45:55,899
Now I have to capture my desktop again.

2474
03:45:59,100 --> 03:45:59,979
Let's hope this works.

2475
03:46:03,299 --> 03:46:04,899
Oh my fucking god.

2476
03:46:04,899 --> 03:46:06,500
I'm so pissed off right now.

2477
03:46:09,459 --> 03:46:11,459
You have no idea how just

2478
03:46:11,459 --> 03:46:12,579
pure angry I am.

2479
03:46:14,569 --> 03:46:15,209
It's gonna work.

2480
03:46:15,209 --> 03:46:15,850
It's working.

2481
03:46:15,850 --> 03:46:16,889
It's gonna work.

2482
03:46:16,889 --> 03:46:21,899
But like, holy shit, I am infuriated at the moment.

2483
03:46:23,020 --> 03:46:24,059
This is so stupid.

2484
03:46:52,790 --> 03:46:58,040
All right, here we go.

2485
03:47:02,219 --> 03:47:03,020
No stun injuries.

2486
03:47:03,020 --> 03:47:04,620
Otherwise, I don't think that people will be able to...

2487
03:47:07,370 --> 03:47:08,729
Let's go ahead and make all this shit again.

2488
03:47:09,530 --> 03:47:13,930
Well, sorry for that.

2489
03:47:13,930 --> 03:47:15,979
That was a lot of bullshit.

2490
03:47:15,979 --> 03:47:17,819
I'm as frustrated as you are.

2491
03:47:17,819 --> 03:47:19,500
Way more frustrated than you probably are.

2492
03:47:22,540 --> 03:47:23,659
But here we go.

2493
03:47:23,899 --> 03:47:24,540
Let's do it again.

2494
03:47:38,440 --> 03:47:38,840
All right.

2495
03:47:46,520 --> 03:47:47,399
And we're back.

2496
03:47:48,389 --> 03:47:48,950
We're here.

2497
03:47:49,750 --> 03:47:51,750
We're finally about to start.

2498
03:47:53,459 --> 03:47:54,819
To a hospital, it's sure.

2499
03:48:07,579 --> 03:48:08,620
So we need...

2500
03:48:08,620 --> 03:48:12,680
I need those sets back.

2501
03:48:12,680 --> 03:48:17,030
But there are a shitload more sets.

2502
03:48:17,750 --> 03:48:18,629
Because, let's see.

2503
03:48:18,629 --> 03:48:19,430
The green screen.

2504
03:48:19,430 --> 03:48:20,069
There we go.

2505
03:48:20,069 --> 03:48:20,389
All right.

2506
03:48:21,030 --> 03:48:23,450
I was wondering where the hell it was.

2507
03:48:25,049 --> 03:48:25,850
Very confusing.

2508
03:48:32,090 --> 03:48:41,139
I'm just gonna get all the sets out here.

2509
03:48:42,260 --> 03:48:48,409
At least the ones that I know I want to use.

2510
03:48:49,530 --> 03:48:50,649
A green screen.

2511
03:48:52,629 --> 03:49:01,909
Okay.

2512
03:49:01,909 --> 03:49:06,459
What does it want me to do?

2513
03:49:08,299 --> 03:49:09,659
Restaurant, hospital, right?

2514
03:49:10,299 --> 03:49:11,180
Stunt school.

2515
03:49:13,219 --> 03:49:14,260
Yeah, I need stunt men.

2516
03:49:27,239 --> 03:49:30,280
Starship Bridge 4 has stunts in it somehow.

2517
03:49:30,840 --> 03:49:34,709
Let's go.

2518
03:49:34,709 --> 03:49:36,870
I got my sci-fi corridor.

2519
03:49:42,010 --> 03:49:44,229
Scrolling landscape.

2520
03:49:45,879 --> 03:49:46,360
Stage.

2521
03:49:47,239 --> 03:49:53,129
Although, I'm not sure...

2522
03:49:53,690 --> 03:49:56,409
I think I can do this and then build what I need, right?

2523
03:49:57,209 --> 03:50:00,969
I think I can just make the movie and then shoot it.

2524
03:50:00,969 --> 03:50:03,209
And I just need to build the things that I use.

2525
03:50:03,209 --> 03:50:04,090
Yeah, I don't need to do this.

2526
03:50:04,969 --> 03:50:07,420
All right.

2527
03:50:07,420 --> 03:50:08,379
So get me out of here.

2528
03:50:13,780 --> 03:50:15,620
Let us go to the script.

2529
03:50:15,620 --> 03:50:16,979
Well, I need to bring in the people.

2530
03:50:16,979 --> 03:50:17,540
But hold on.

2531
03:50:17,540 --> 03:50:18,899
Here's the worst thing about this.

2532
03:50:18,899 --> 03:50:20,420
Are the actors going to be available?

2533
03:50:20,420 --> 03:50:22,260
Or do I have to make them in a separate...

2534
03:50:22,260 --> 03:50:23,139
That shouldn't happen, right?

2535
03:50:24,020 --> 03:50:26,549
It's kind of running like shit.

2536
03:50:27,190 --> 03:50:33,780
Why is it running like this?

2537
03:50:34,579 --> 03:50:39,219
Now, I'm going to do a full-on re in a second here.

2538
03:50:47,420 --> 03:50:51,079
Eddie.

2539
03:50:51,719 --> 03:50:54,489
Adam Sandler.

2540
03:51:00,709 --> 03:51:01,930
And you.

2541
03:51:02,969 --> 03:51:04,549
Now, I need you.

2542
03:51:04,549 --> 03:51:05,590
Somebody needs to be a director.

2543
03:51:06,549 --> 03:51:07,350
Which I was going to do.

2544
03:51:07,909 --> 03:51:08,629
Can I do any more?

2545
03:51:15,530 --> 03:51:16,090
Oh, shit.

2546
03:51:16,090 --> 03:51:17,290
I just made this person a director.

2547
03:51:18,010 --> 03:51:19,290
I just made Leo the director.

2548
03:51:19,290 --> 03:51:19,930
No, no, no, no, no.

2549
03:51:20,569 --> 03:51:21,940
You're an actor.

2550
03:51:21,940 --> 03:51:22,340
Don't worry.

2551
03:51:28,280 --> 03:51:29,319
Who should be the director?

2552
03:51:29,319 --> 03:51:29,879
No.

2553
03:51:29,879 --> 03:51:30,120
You.

2554
03:51:31,159 --> 03:51:32,280
All right.

2555
03:51:32,280 --> 03:51:32,600
We're good.

2556
03:51:33,159 --> 03:51:37,059
Let's go to the script office.

2557
03:51:37,700 --> 03:51:40,620
Which is down...

2558
03:51:41,340 --> 03:51:42,059
Cult Starzence.

2559
03:51:42,059 --> 03:51:42,620
What the hell is that?

2560
03:51:44,299 --> 03:51:44,940
Hospital.

2561
03:51:44,940 --> 03:51:45,979
This is post-production.

2562
03:51:48,010 --> 03:51:48,649
Where is the...

2563
03:51:56,389 --> 03:51:56,709
No.

2564
03:51:56,709 --> 03:51:57,670
Do I not have one?

2565
03:52:04,819 --> 03:52:05,700
Custom script.

2566
03:52:05,700 --> 03:52:06,420
I already own it.

2567
03:52:06,420 --> 03:52:07,700
I have no idea what the hell it is, though.

2568
03:52:08,420 --> 03:52:10,819
It's literally right next to me.

2569
03:52:11,540 --> 03:52:11,780
All right.

2570
03:52:11,780 --> 03:52:12,260
Here we go.

2571
03:52:13,299 --> 03:52:15,379
We can finally create something.

2572
03:52:15,379 --> 03:52:16,659
After a million years.

2573
03:52:20,860 --> 03:52:22,139
We already did the first one, but...

2574
03:52:23,239 --> 03:52:24,760
It took like 20 fucking minutes.

2575
03:52:24,760 --> 03:52:26,120
30 minutes to get this going again.

2576
03:52:26,680 --> 03:52:28,700
Let's try it again.

2577
03:52:28,700 --> 03:52:35,940
This is action.

2578
03:52:40,680 --> 03:52:43,590
Jax and Leo.

2579
03:52:46,680 --> 03:52:49,239
And Adam Sandler.

2580
03:52:49,239 --> 03:52:53,340
You are the studio head.

2581
03:52:54,059 --> 03:52:59,379
What was this guy's name?

2582
03:53:02,579 --> 03:53:04,819
Kurt Rock?

2583
03:53:11,299 --> 03:53:12,260
Brock Hardman?

2584
03:53:12,260 --> 03:53:12,819
No, no, no, no.

2585
03:53:12,819 --> 03:53:14,340
It was Kurt Frightener.

2586
03:53:14,340 --> 03:53:14,579
Yeah.

2587
03:53:15,299 --> 03:53:20,760
Pogo Stick?

2588
03:53:21,399 --> 03:53:25,459
All right.

2589
03:53:25,459 --> 03:53:26,100
Good.

2590
03:53:26,100 --> 03:53:30,059
Now it's you do costumes.

2591
03:53:39,190 --> 03:53:39,430
Go.

2592
03:53:42,969 --> 03:53:43,690
You.

2593
03:53:43,690 --> 03:53:44,090
Over here.

2594
03:53:53,450 --> 03:53:55,209
He's in a firefighter outfit?

2595
03:53:55,209 --> 03:53:55,450
No.

2596
03:53:56,569 --> 03:53:57,850
It's like the Space Marine one.

2597
03:53:57,850 --> 03:53:58,250
Where is it?

2598
03:53:58,809 --> 03:54:06,469
Did I pass it already?

2599
03:54:09,659 --> 03:54:10,219
Oh, here we go.

2600
03:54:10,780 --> 03:54:12,729
This is better.

2601
03:54:13,370 --> 03:54:15,319
I like that better than the other one.

2602
03:54:18,229 --> 03:54:19,750
And then this had that was like the lizard.

2603
03:54:30,200 --> 03:54:31,319
Or should it be the lizard?

2604
03:54:33,989 --> 03:54:34,229
Yeah.

2605
03:54:35,270 --> 03:54:35,829
I think so.

2606
03:54:39,579 --> 03:54:39,979
All right.

2607
03:54:42,069 --> 03:54:43,190
Welcome to E3.

2608
03:54:44,709 --> 03:54:45,190
Finally.

2609
03:54:45,750 --> 03:54:46,309
Let's go.

2610
03:54:50,180 --> 03:54:54,489
We're starting on the stage.

2611
03:54:54,489 --> 03:55:04,840
Stunts.

2612
03:55:04,840 --> 03:55:05,959
Thank God.

2613
03:55:05,959 --> 03:55:12,600
I was about to throw up all of my insides.

2614
03:55:12,600 --> 03:55:13,399
So we need to do...

2615
03:55:14,920 --> 03:55:16,059
Just get static here.

2616
03:55:20,569 --> 03:55:21,209
There we go.

2617
03:55:21,209 --> 03:55:21,610
All right.

2618
03:55:21,610 --> 03:55:22,569
See, free cam.

2619
03:55:24,250 --> 03:55:25,370
That's what I was...

2620
03:55:25,370 --> 03:55:26,250
You see what's happening?

2621
03:55:26,250 --> 03:55:26,729
You know what I mean?

2622
03:55:26,729 --> 03:55:28,090
I was like, what the fuck was happening?

2623
03:55:28,090 --> 03:55:29,450
Why can I not move the camera?

2624
03:55:29,450 --> 03:55:30,250
I didn't have the...

2625
03:55:30,250 --> 03:55:33,530
I didn't have the fucking EXE installed somehow.

2626
03:55:33,530 --> 03:55:34,090
But I did.

2627
03:55:34,090 --> 03:55:35,450
I had to like replace it twice.

2628
03:55:39,079 --> 03:55:39,399
All right.

2629
03:55:39,399 --> 03:55:41,079
So let's start here.

2630
03:55:41,079 --> 03:55:42,600
We're gonna have him walk on stage.

2631
03:55:44,889 --> 03:55:51,530
So I think this is just start position.

2632
03:55:51,530 --> 03:55:52,889
And it's end position too, right?

2633
03:55:52,889 --> 03:55:53,370
That's fine.

2634
03:55:57,479 --> 03:55:58,520
Maybe I don't even need to do that.

2635
03:55:59,159 --> 03:56:00,889
Let's look at it from the...

2636
03:56:00,889 --> 03:56:01,530
Yep.

2637
03:56:01,530 --> 03:56:02,250
From the camera.

2638
03:56:03,129 --> 03:56:04,219
All right.

2639
03:56:04,219 --> 03:56:07,100
Now backdrop.

2640
03:56:12,729 --> 03:56:13,610
Green screen.

2641
03:56:16,200 --> 03:56:18,200
But the green screen implies that this...

2642
03:56:19,000 --> 03:56:22,340
We have to be somewhere else.

2643
03:56:26,819 --> 03:56:27,780
This is pretty close.

2644
03:56:28,340 --> 03:56:37,500
This is pretty good too.

2645
03:56:39,690 --> 03:56:41,129
E3 on a rooftop.

2646
03:56:47,190 --> 03:56:50,069
It's like a news station.

2647
03:56:50,069 --> 03:56:50,870
This is pretty good.

2648
03:56:55,479 --> 03:56:56,680
Oh my God.

2649
03:56:56,680 --> 03:56:57,319
24.

2650
03:56:57,959 --> 03:57:04,040
Yeah, we're gonna do...

2651
03:57:04,040 --> 03:57:04,680
Oh my God.

2652
03:57:04,680 --> 03:57:05,159
24.

2653
03:57:05,719 --> 03:57:09,209
Sounds good to me.

2654
03:57:11,850 --> 03:57:12,170
Okay.

2655
03:57:12,170 --> 03:57:12,649
Stage.

2656
03:57:13,670 --> 03:57:14,069
Let's see.

2657
03:57:16,069 --> 03:57:19,159
We need to have preparation.

2658
03:57:19,159 --> 03:57:20,360
Walk with a briefcase.

2659
03:57:20,360 --> 03:57:27,219
It's got to be the right scene though.

2660
03:57:27,219 --> 03:57:28,540
Oh my God.

2661
03:57:28,540 --> 03:57:29,020
24.

2662
03:57:29,579 --> 03:57:38,649
Okay.

2663
03:57:38,649 --> 03:57:42,979
Let's slow that down a little.

2664
03:57:42,979 --> 03:57:44,020
By the way, let me just...

2665
03:57:44,020 --> 03:57:45,059
I want to just rip...

2666
03:57:45,059 --> 03:57:47,860
Sorry for that last like 30, 40 minutes, guys.

2667
03:57:49,540 --> 03:57:50,979
I was about to throw in the towel.

2668
03:57:51,540 --> 03:57:53,459
So like I'm back to...

2669
03:57:53,459 --> 03:57:54,180
We're good.

2670
03:57:54,180 --> 03:57:54,979
Everything's fine.

2671
03:57:54,979 --> 03:57:56,180
I'm sorry that that happened.

2672
03:57:56,899 --> 03:57:58,420
But I just want to say that I...

2673
03:57:59,219 --> 03:58:01,930
I was trying to handle that.

2674
03:58:02,920 --> 03:58:03,639
I was trying.

2675
03:58:04,200 --> 03:58:08,459
What happened?

2676
03:58:09,020 --> 03:58:12,219
The game didn't load in the expansion and I almost lost my mind.

2677
03:58:14,860 --> 03:58:15,180
All right.

2678
03:58:15,180 --> 03:58:19,479
So this needs to be a little bit longer.

2679
03:58:20,280 --> 03:58:24,680
Why would the case in the hand matter?

2680
03:58:24,680 --> 03:58:24,920
All right.

2681
03:58:24,920 --> 03:58:26,040
I need to do free camera here.

2682
03:58:26,969 --> 03:58:27,290
All right.

2683
03:58:27,290 --> 03:58:27,930
Start position.

2684
03:58:27,930 --> 03:58:29,129
We're gonna do over here.

2685
03:58:32,469 --> 03:58:34,790
The immersion is gonna be broken so badly.

2686
03:58:36,500 --> 03:58:39,940
You're shooting this in like a fucking restaurant.

2687
03:58:43,770 --> 03:58:44,809
Let's do start here.

2688
03:58:45,530 --> 03:58:50,540
And then we're gonna end here while he walks.

2689
03:58:51,260 --> 03:59:00,469
Let's see what that looks like.

2690
03:59:00,950 --> 03:59:08,340
Why would he walk by the camera?

2691
03:59:15,479 --> 03:59:16,040
Like stop.

2692
03:59:16,040 --> 03:59:17,159
I didn't turn to the camera.

2693
03:59:17,159 --> 03:59:21,479
He's just gonna walk by.

2694
03:59:21,479 --> 03:59:21,799
Okay.

2695
03:59:21,799 --> 03:59:27,370
Can I have him still with that in his hand?

2696
03:59:27,370 --> 03:59:28,889
Walk briefcase again.

2697
03:59:28,889 --> 03:59:29,290
Yeah.

2698
03:59:29,290 --> 03:59:30,729
We need a little bit more than that.

2699
03:59:30,729 --> 03:59:40,139
So he goes this way.

2700
03:59:40,139 --> 03:59:41,430
Comes over here.

2701
03:59:41,430 --> 03:59:47,049
Where is he?

2702
03:59:47,049 --> 03:59:50,440
Change the scene to another scene here.

2703
03:59:51,000 --> 03:59:54,250
Okay.

2704
03:59:54,250 --> 03:59:55,530
So he just walks by.

2705
03:59:55,530 --> 03:59:57,530
But we need him to walk from the other direction.

2706
04:00:01,700 --> 04:00:04,979
He's gonna take a long time to get to this fucking stage.

2707
04:00:05,620 --> 04:00:06,020
All right.

2708
04:00:06,020 --> 04:00:06,739
Hold on.

2709
04:00:06,739 --> 04:00:21,299
So I need to do go to start position is I want to move out.

2710
04:00:21,299 --> 04:00:24,040
How do I move the camera up?

2711
04:00:25,100 --> 04:00:25,579
Whoa.

2712
04:00:25,579 --> 04:00:26,860
What is this field of view?

2713
04:00:33,079 --> 04:00:35,159
How do I move the camera up?

2714
04:00:35,159 --> 04:00:35,399
Alt.

2715
04:00:36,120 --> 04:00:36,600
There we go.

2716
04:00:36,600 --> 04:00:43,209
Alt.

2717
04:00:43,209 --> 04:00:45,370
This movie is a joke compared to your magnum opus.

2718
04:00:45,370 --> 04:00:45,930
Get out of town.

2719
04:00:45,930 --> 04:00:50,090
You'll never top that heart-wrenching scene when Benedict was brutally murdered and shitted himself.

2720
04:00:50,090 --> 04:00:50,590
Okay.

2721
04:00:51,370 --> 04:01:11,129
Is that gonna be enough?

2722
04:01:11,770 --> 04:01:19,530
Let's see.

2723
04:01:20,250 --> 04:01:29,659
This stage is way is not.

2724
04:01:29,659 --> 04:01:30,940
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2725
04:01:30,940 --> 04:01:37,590
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the head of Oh My God Studios.

2726
04:01:40,149 --> 04:01:43,299
Studio head Greg.

2727
04:01:54,549 --> 04:01:55,030
All right.

2728
04:01:55,030 --> 04:01:55,989
Should we do one more?

2729
04:01:57,239 --> 04:01:58,200
Or is he here?

2730
04:01:58,200 --> 04:02:06,860
Let's have him coming into the scene now.

2731
04:02:06,860 --> 04:02:07,819
Walk with a scanner.

2732
04:02:07,819 --> 04:02:09,100
Brandish blade.

2733
04:02:09,100 --> 04:02:10,729
No, no, no, no, no.

2734
04:02:10,729 --> 04:02:11,930
Is there any more briefcase?

2735
04:02:15,209 --> 04:02:16,010
Enter briefcase.

2736
04:02:16,010 --> 04:02:16,569
Here we go.

2737
04:02:16,569 --> 04:02:18,090
Enter briefcase.

2738
04:02:18,090 --> 04:02:20,659
What does it look like?

2739
04:02:24,700 --> 04:02:25,979
That's the same one.

2740
04:02:25,979 --> 04:02:27,020
Is it the same one?

2741
04:02:37,299 --> 04:02:37,860
What other?

2742
04:02:37,860 --> 04:02:39,670
What?

2743
04:02:39,670 --> 04:02:40,709
Walk briefcase.

2744
04:02:40,709 --> 04:02:42,149
Enter briefcase.

2745
04:02:42,149 --> 04:02:48,139
What about exit briefcase?

2746
04:02:52,620 --> 04:02:53,500
They're all the same thing.

2747
04:02:56,979 --> 04:02:57,479
Okay.

2748
04:02:57,940 --> 04:02:58,899
We're gonna change this.

2749
04:03:02,139 --> 04:03:05,340
Now we're just gonna have like talking.

2750
04:03:05,340 --> 04:03:06,379
Talk left.

2751
04:03:06,379 --> 04:03:06,620
All right.

2752
04:03:06,620 --> 04:03:07,180
So here we go.

2753
04:03:07,180 --> 04:03:07,420
Talk.

2754
04:03:14,389 --> 04:03:15,750
There's no other person here.

2755
04:03:15,750 --> 04:03:16,069
Don't worry.

2756
04:03:16,069 --> 04:03:17,110
We're not gonna even use them.

2757
04:03:18,819 --> 04:03:19,780
Duration long.

2758
04:03:21,020 --> 04:03:22,459
Left actor is happy.

2759
04:03:23,690 --> 04:03:26,170
And the right actor doesn't matter because the right actor is not even in the scene.

2760
04:03:46,120 --> 04:03:47,479
His mouth isn't even moving.

2761
04:03:56,729 --> 04:03:57,450
No, no, no.

2762
04:03:57,450 --> 04:03:58,329
Happy is not gonna work.

2763
04:04:01,159 --> 04:04:02,920
This needs to be something else.

2764
04:04:04,729 --> 04:04:06,569
Angry, romantic, sad.

2765
04:04:07,739 --> 04:04:08,459
Just neutral.

2766
04:04:13,049 --> 04:04:13,209
All right.

2767
04:04:13,209 --> 04:04:13,610
That's better.

2768
04:04:14,409 --> 04:04:16,649
Then we give the crowd cheer.

2769
04:04:24,760 --> 04:04:27,959
There is a person on the right that he's like talking to.

2770
04:04:28,600 --> 04:04:29,940
Hold on.

2771
04:04:29,940 --> 04:04:30,659
Is there a better one?

2772
04:04:31,219 --> 04:04:33,700
Is it like a just one person talk?

2773
04:04:38,280 --> 04:04:39,000
Now it's two people.

2774
04:04:39,000 --> 04:04:40,040
I can just remove the other person.

2775
04:04:40,040 --> 04:04:40,440
Here we go.

2776
04:04:40,440 --> 04:04:40,920
Talk right.

2777
04:04:40,920 --> 04:04:46,170
It's always gonna be talk turn.

2778
04:04:47,540 --> 04:04:48,500
Talk to dog.

2779
04:04:50,459 --> 04:04:51,420
Payphone talk.

2780
04:04:55,180 --> 04:04:55,659
Let's see.

2781
04:04:57,239 --> 04:04:57,639
Intro.

2782
04:04:58,809 --> 04:04:59,610
Weight lifting.

2783
04:04:59,610 --> 04:05:01,770
He comes out and just like lifts up a bunch of fucking weights.

2784
04:05:07,500 --> 04:05:10,409
Monologue.

2785
04:05:10,409 --> 04:05:14,579
Perfect.

2786
04:05:14,579 --> 04:05:15,379
See what we got here.

2787
04:05:16,260 --> 04:05:16,579
Mood.

2788
04:05:19,829 --> 04:05:20,629
Happy.

2789
04:05:20,629 --> 04:05:21,190
Perspective.

2790
04:05:22,069 --> 04:05:22,389
Why?

2791
04:05:22,389 --> 04:05:24,069
We can just change the duration.

2792
04:05:24,790 --> 04:05:25,190
Medium.

2793
04:05:25,989 --> 04:05:27,110
See how this goes.

2794
04:05:27,110 --> 04:05:27,350
Okay.

2795
04:05:27,350 --> 04:05:40,090
Let's get another cut here with like a close up.

2796
04:05:42,600 --> 04:05:43,079
Same thing.

2797
04:05:43,959 --> 04:05:51,559
I'll change the backdrops.

2798
04:05:51,559 --> 04:05:51,879
Don't worry.

2799
04:05:52,520 --> 04:06:01,579
Put Minecraft in the background.

2800
04:06:02,139 --> 04:06:11,530
Okay.

2801
04:06:13,610 --> 04:06:15,370
Maybe like right here.

2802
04:06:18,180 --> 04:06:20,420
This one he's gonna be angry.

2803
04:06:22,549 --> 04:06:22,870
Mood.

2804
04:06:23,590 --> 04:06:24,229
Argumentative.

2805
04:06:26,040 --> 04:06:26,600
Duration.

2806
04:06:26,600 --> 04:06:27,239
Abrupt.

2807
04:06:27,239 --> 04:06:28,200
Let's try this one on.

2808
04:06:36,500 --> 04:06:39,459
Apparently he didn't like the way the audience reacted to this.

2809
04:06:40,100 --> 04:06:47,260
I'm gonna go back here.

2810
04:06:48,600 --> 04:06:48,920
Yeah.

2811
04:06:48,920 --> 04:06:49,479
24.

2812
04:06:50,360 --> 04:06:52,549
Put that back here as well.

2813
04:06:53,350 --> 04:06:56,899
All right.

2814
04:06:56,899 --> 04:06:57,620
I need an audience.

2815
04:07:03,450 --> 04:07:05,850
Is there like a the play?

2816
04:07:07,079 --> 04:07:10,889
There's got to be a bar.

2817
04:07:10,889 --> 04:07:11,610
No, no.

2818
04:07:11,610 --> 04:07:17,030
Like a theater.

2819
04:07:17,030 --> 04:07:17,590
Jail.

2820
04:07:17,590 --> 04:07:18,389
Saloon.

2821
04:07:18,389 --> 04:07:18,950
Bedroom.

2822
04:07:18,950 --> 04:07:19,430
Street.

2823
04:07:20,149 --> 04:07:25,129
I wonder if there's like a crowd or something.

2824
04:07:25,850 --> 04:07:34,540
Or at least a place where people could be like sitting.

2825
04:07:35,100 --> 04:07:38,840
I don't think so.

2826
04:07:43,670 --> 04:07:45,270
Someone's just watching from their living room.

2827
04:07:45,909 --> 04:07:51,579
Someone's watching on their computer.

2828
04:07:51,579 --> 04:07:52,379
It's like a live stream.

2829
04:07:53,020 --> 04:07:57,379
I think we're just gonna have to do extras.

2830
04:07:58,809 --> 04:08:00,090
And on stage.

2831
04:08:00,090 --> 04:08:01,450
But with a different backdrop.

2832
04:08:02,170 --> 04:08:06,299
Yeah.

2833
04:08:06,299 --> 04:08:06,620
Let's see.

2834
04:08:06,620 --> 04:08:07,260
Like crowd.

2835
04:08:10,180 --> 04:08:10,500
No.

2836
04:08:10,500 --> 04:08:11,219
Like group.

2837
04:08:12,979 --> 04:08:13,700
Group meeting.

2838
04:08:13,700 --> 04:08:14,500
Group move.

2839
04:08:18,709 --> 04:08:19,110
Cheer.

2840
04:08:22,200 --> 04:08:24,020
Conversation.

2841
04:08:24,020 --> 04:08:24,739
Investigation.

2842
04:08:24,739 --> 04:08:25,459
I think we can just do.

2843
04:08:26,180 --> 04:08:29,129
We could probably just do static.

2844
04:08:31,959 --> 04:08:33,079
Sit and talk.

2845
04:08:33,079 --> 04:08:33,319
Yeah.

2846
04:08:33,319 --> 04:08:34,920
I mean that you could do sit and talk.

2847
04:08:37,879 --> 04:08:40,040
Sit and see people just smoking.

2848
04:08:41,719 --> 04:08:41,959
Yeah.

2849
04:08:41,959 --> 04:08:43,719
Static with a bunch of extras I think is the best.

2850
04:08:44,860 --> 04:08:46,379
The audience is sitting on the ground.

2851
04:08:49,620 --> 04:08:50,420
Let's do static.

2852
04:08:54,629 --> 04:09:01,559
And change the backdrop to something that looks like they're in the theater.

2853
04:09:02,200 --> 04:09:16,260
Burning city.

2854
04:09:18,149 --> 04:09:19,110
Canvas background.

2855
04:09:19,670 --> 04:09:19,909
No.

2856
04:09:30,309 --> 04:09:31,190
Falling.

2857
04:09:31,190 --> 04:09:31,510
Wait.

2858
04:09:31,510 --> 04:09:32,870
Everyone's falling.

2859
04:09:32,870 --> 04:09:41,219
This looks all right.

2860
04:09:41,219 --> 04:09:44,329
All right.

2861
04:09:44,329 --> 04:09:45,129
We need extras.

2862
04:09:49,340 --> 04:09:50,459
Supporting role.

2863
04:09:50,459 --> 04:09:52,139
First extra extra.

2864
04:09:52,139 --> 04:09:52,780
Okay.

2865
04:09:52,780 --> 04:10:05,479
This is going to need a lot of extras.

2866
04:10:06,360 --> 04:10:07,799
Okay.

2867
04:10:07,799 --> 04:10:09,959
How do I take like the gun away from this person?

2868
04:10:19,639 --> 04:10:21,079
How do I get this off?

2869
04:10:31,059 --> 04:10:32,899
There's no way I can get rid of this.

2870
04:10:35,909 --> 04:10:37,030
How do I delete this?

2871
04:10:45,579 --> 04:10:48,629
What is going on over here?

2872
04:10:48,629 --> 04:10:49,030
Yeah.

2873
04:10:49,030 --> 04:10:53,590
I'm just going to delete this extra.

2874
04:10:53,590 --> 04:10:57,860
Okay.

2875
04:10:57,860 --> 04:10:58,979
And this one too.

2876
04:10:58,979 --> 04:10:59,780
And this one.

2877
04:10:59,780 --> 04:11:00,899
And you as well.

2878
04:11:02,020 --> 04:11:03,700
You're not going to be in this movie.

2879
04:11:03,700 --> 04:11:13,110
And they're making zombie noises.

2880
04:11:13,110 --> 04:11:14,309
Wait.

2881
04:11:14,309 --> 04:11:15,350
Change props.

2882
04:11:15,350 --> 04:11:16,149
Oh shit.

2883
04:11:16,149 --> 04:11:28,180
Okay.

2884
04:11:28,180 --> 04:11:28,659
All right.

2885
04:11:28,659 --> 04:11:29,299
Let's see.

2886
04:11:29,299 --> 04:11:30,100
Change props.

2887
04:11:33,209 --> 04:11:34,010
Slot one.

2888
04:11:35,899 --> 04:11:36,139
Yeah.

2889
04:11:36,139 --> 04:11:37,340
I cleared the props.

2890
04:11:37,899 --> 04:11:40,969
So how do I?

2891
04:11:40,969 --> 04:11:42,170
Can I put something else in here?

2892
04:11:50,979 --> 04:11:57,270
All these props are just guns.

2893
04:11:57,270 --> 04:11:58,309
Different cell phones.

2894
04:11:58,309 --> 04:11:59,110
What the hell is this?

2895
04:11:59,110 --> 04:11:59,989
Seashell?

2896
04:11:59,989 --> 04:12:05,290
Okay.

2897
04:12:05,290 --> 04:12:05,450
No.

2898
04:12:05,450 --> 04:12:06,250
You don't get.

2899
04:12:06,250 --> 04:12:09,850
Nobody gets a gun.

2900
04:12:09,850 --> 04:12:10,090
Okay.

2901
04:12:10,090 --> 04:12:11,129
This is a banana.

2902
04:12:11,129 --> 04:12:12,969
You can have a banana in your hand.

2903
04:12:12,969 --> 04:12:17,020
That's fine.

2904
04:12:17,020 --> 04:12:17,340
Okay.

2905
04:12:17,340 --> 04:12:18,139
That's fine.

2906
04:12:18,139 --> 04:12:32,790
So now we can edit this and put this in a different spot.

2907
04:12:32,790 --> 04:12:34,149
So he talks here.

2908
04:12:34,149 --> 04:12:38,979
Let's make sure we got that correct.

2909
04:12:38,979 --> 04:12:42,309
We actually need to move the camera a little bit.

2910
04:12:42,870 --> 04:12:46,149
Let's do free cam.

2911
04:12:46,870 --> 04:12:55,639
Make it at least look like they're sitting down.

2912
04:12:56,200 --> 04:12:58,280
Except how would they be?

2913
04:12:58,280 --> 04:12:59,879
At least some of them is sitting down.

2914
04:12:59,879 --> 04:13:05,989
Just somebody just staring off into the distance.

2915
04:13:05,989 --> 04:13:06,229
All right.

2916
04:13:06,229 --> 04:13:06,790
That's fine.

2917
04:13:07,510 --> 04:13:10,180
So we go from here.

2918
04:13:15,079 --> 04:13:16,200
Talks about a few things.

2919
04:13:16,200 --> 04:13:18,520
We're going to have at least three or four different adjectives here.

2920
04:13:19,159 --> 04:13:27,559
And then it leads to showing the audience.

2921
04:13:28,360 --> 04:13:33,500
And then we come back to his reaction.

2922
04:13:36,469 --> 04:13:37,829
He's going to announce a mobile game.

2923
04:13:38,389 --> 04:13:39,670
They're all going to fucking boo.

2924
04:13:41,129 --> 04:13:43,129
And then he's going to say, well, let's show it.

2925
04:13:53,079 --> 04:13:54,520
How about let's put the monologue.

2926
04:13:55,559 --> 04:14:02,920
Somebody like from the audience comes up.

2927
04:14:04,739 --> 04:14:06,579
It's like a strangling match with them.

2928
04:14:16,170 --> 04:14:16,569
Okay.

2929
04:14:16,569 --> 04:14:21,340
So angry.

2930
04:14:23,299 --> 04:14:25,459
And it's going to be a short.

2931
04:14:25,459 --> 04:14:26,360
Let's see.

2932
04:14:27,159 --> 04:14:37,879
It's going to probably come up shade of my face.

2933
04:14:37,879 --> 04:14:39,559
This is going to make me a billion dollars.

2934
04:14:41,379 --> 04:14:42,340
All right, motherfucker.

2935
04:14:42,340 --> 04:14:43,860
And he like sprints up.

2936
04:14:43,860 --> 04:15:12,739
This is an extra running angry direction this way.

2937
04:15:12,739 --> 04:15:12,979
Yeah.

2938
04:15:20,229 --> 04:15:21,190
Can we slow that down?

2939
04:15:28,059 --> 04:15:32,860
Determined.

2940
04:15:32,860 --> 04:15:40,629
Determined is so fast.

2941
04:15:50,920 --> 04:15:53,159
Yeah, I think that's the one.

2942
04:15:53,319 --> 04:16:10,250
To do.

2943
04:16:10,250 --> 04:16:10,809
Where is it?

2944
04:16:16,149 --> 04:16:17,030
News logo five.

2945
04:16:27,459 --> 04:16:28,100
All right.

2946
04:16:28,100 --> 04:16:29,540
So then he's going to get like one.

2947
04:16:29,540 --> 04:16:30,659
He's just going to get knocked out.

2948
04:16:40,100 --> 04:16:41,780
The only thing is this could be a different person.

2949
04:16:47,750 --> 04:16:49,510
It's just going to be a random extra that's up here.

2950
04:16:59,190 --> 04:17:01,829
Action, tame, mild, moderate, extreme.

2951
04:17:10,569 --> 04:17:11,930
Holy shit.

2952
04:17:19,270 --> 04:17:20,389
That is extreme.

2953
04:17:20,389 --> 04:17:38,899
All right.

2954
04:17:38,899 --> 04:17:40,500
I think I just like the first perspective.

2955
04:17:41,700 --> 04:17:47,129
Okay.

2956
04:17:48,090 --> 04:17:50,329
That is we got to be on the right backdrop.

2957
04:17:50,329 --> 04:17:52,250
I actually have to I have to film this.

2958
04:17:52,250 --> 04:17:58,299
We got to get the start position over here.

2959
04:17:59,799 --> 04:18:07,399
So it looks like, you know, that he may have just he may have ran over here.

2960
04:18:07,399 --> 04:18:09,879
I don't want him in the scene yet.

2961
04:18:09,879 --> 04:18:21,930
And then we move forward and let's see how that looks.

2962
04:18:24,600 --> 04:18:25,639
Like he just queued it up.

2963
04:18:26,280 --> 04:18:35,639
Wait a minute.

2964
04:18:35,639 --> 04:18:48,420
Okay, hold on.

2965
04:18:48,420 --> 04:18:49,379
Start position here.

2966
04:18:50,180 --> 04:18:51,620
Go mark position.

2967
04:18:52,340 --> 04:18:53,780
Go to mark position.

2968
04:18:53,780 --> 04:18:54,020
Right.

2969
04:18:56,420 --> 04:19:00,360
And then the second position is here.

2970
04:19:01,079 --> 04:19:04,870
And then we mark this one too.

2971
04:19:06,680 --> 04:19:07,399
Mark position.

2972
04:19:11,379 --> 04:19:12,180
That's right, right?

2973
04:19:12,819 --> 04:19:13,659
Should be.

2974
04:19:14,219 --> 04:19:21,659
Why is it not doing it?

2975
04:19:21,659 --> 04:19:26,680
Shouldn't it shouldn't that position be marked here?

2976
04:19:27,559 --> 04:19:34,649
Because if this is position one, here's your start position.

2977
04:19:36,840 --> 04:19:45,399
It's marked here and I want it to move.

2978
04:19:46,280 --> 04:19:47,719
Yeah, it's a key frame.

2979
04:19:47,719 --> 04:19:48,280
So shouldn't it?

2980
04:19:49,540 --> 04:19:55,059
Wouldn't this be, you know, like I can't mark it here.

2981
04:20:04,170 --> 04:20:05,370
Not quite key framing.

2982
04:20:06,420 --> 04:20:09,059
Start and end equals beginning and end of the clip.

2983
04:20:09,059 --> 04:20:09,620
Oh, okay.

2984
04:20:14,309 --> 04:20:15,670
So this is beginning of the clip.

2985
04:20:16,309 --> 04:20:22,299
Position two is at the end right now.

2986
04:20:22,299 --> 04:20:25,379
So I would want it to be start position.

2987
04:20:26,260 --> 04:20:31,190
But wouldn't I want it to be start position and then, well,

2988
04:20:31,190 --> 04:20:32,309
like I have to move it forward a little?

2989
04:20:40,069 --> 04:20:43,270
Because I think of this like it's not key frames,

2990
04:20:43,270 --> 04:20:48,620
but move the camera on the second timeline.

2991
04:20:51,270 --> 04:20:52,069
Oh, I see here.

2992
04:20:55,180 --> 04:20:56,059
So I can do this.

2993
04:20:56,860 --> 04:20:58,629
If I mark it.

2994
04:20:59,190 --> 04:21:07,000
How come I can't get, I'm not, I'm not getting,

2995
04:21:07,000 --> 04:21:08,440
I'm not putting this together here in my head.

2996
04:21:20,819 --> 04:21:21,940
Oh, Jesus Christ.

2997
04:21:21,940 --> 04:21:23,139
What the hell is this doing over here?

2998
04:21:30,100 --> 04:21:31,700
All right.

2999
04:21:31,700 --> 04:21:41,180
So here we go.

3000
04:21:41,180 --> 04:21:46,020
See if that fixes it.

3001
04:21:46,020 --> 04:21:50,329
So then right, I want it to be like here.

3002
04:21:50,329 --> 04:22:04,219
Let's see if that does it.

3003
04:22:04,219 --> 04:22:07,030
Fuck.

3004
04:22:07,030 --> 04:22:07,829
God damn it.

3005
04:22:08,549 --> 04:22:09,590
What is happening here?

3006
04:22:19,100 --> 04:22:22,680
Camera two, what the hell?

3007
04:22:22,680 --> 04:22:23,799
Why did I drag it over?

3008
04:22:23,799 --> 04:22:27,340
What marked position?

3009
04:22:27,340 --> 04:22:28,860
This is camera one.

3010
04:22:28,860 --> 04:22:31,020
Camera one is here.

3011
04:22:31,020 --> 04:22:37,879
Camera two is, I want camera two to be here.

3012
04:22:37,879 --> 04:22:39,319
What the fuck am I doing here?

3013
04:22:41,659 --> 04:22:44,299
Position one, position two.

3014
04:22:44,299 --> 04:22:46,219
Position one, position two.

3015
04:22:49,989 --> 04:22:53,959
So I want it to be like, so I, it's just like weird.

3016
04:22:53,959 --> 04:23:06,700
Position one, position two.

3017
04:23:06,700 --> 04:23:07,100
Okay.

3018
04:23:07,100 --> 04:23:09,020
So this is, this is correct now, right?

3019
04:23:09,020 --> 04:23:22,149
This shit's correct.

3020
04:23:22,149 --> 04:23:22,469
All right.

3021
04:23:22,469 --> 04:23:22,950
There we go.

3022
04:23:23,350 --> 04:23:24,469
That's kind of a weird system.

3023
04:23:27,450 --> 04:23:34,709
All right.

3024
04:23:34,709 --> 04:23:35,270
Here we go.

3025
04:23:35,270 --> 04:23:49,459
I think, yeah.

3026
04:23:49,459 --> 04:23:49,620
Okay.

3027
04:23:49,620 --> 04:23:51,139
So that's going to be an edit.

3028
04:23:51,139 --> 04:23:54,260
So I'll edit that out.

3029
04:23:54,260 --> 04:23:56,459
I'm going to have him fall down

3030
04:23:56,459 --> 04:23:59,930
and then the trailer is going to play.

3031
04:23:59,930 --> 04:24:12,700
He like just fucking knocked himself out.

3032
04:24:12,700 --> 04:24:13,500
What would that be under?

3033
04:24:13,500 --> 04:24:13,899
Let's see.

3034
04:24:17,909 --> 04:24:23,690
Violence, dead body.

3035
04:24:25,540 --> 04:24:28,340
He drinks poison and then the clip plays.

3036
04:24:30,680 --> 04:24:32,120
Just make him fight the crowd.

3037
04:24:32,680 --> 04:24:37,110
Crouch shoot.

3038
04:24:38,040 --> 04:24:41,000
Oh, I thought the first thing I thought was crotch shoot.

3039
04:24:41,000 --> 04:24:51,959
What about unconscious?

3040
04:24:51,959 --> 04:24:57,530
Let's see.

3041
04:24:57,530 --> 04:25:03,290
Pursuit, resolution, impact.

3042
04:25:05,700 --> 04:25:06,739
Head, oh right.

3043
04:25:06,739 --> 04:25:14,360
This one.

3044
04:25:14,360 --> 04:25:16,120
He fucking head butts the guy

3045
04:25:16,120 --> 04:25:18,840
and then instantly gets knocked out in the trailer plays.

3046
04:25:18,840 --> 04:25:37,959
Now this is better.

3047
04:25:37,959 --> 04:25:39,319
He just already out.

3048
04:25:39,319 --> 04:25:42,299
Okay.

3049
04:25:42,299 --> 04:25:43,579
Let's change the camera here.

3050
04:25:43,579 --> 04:26:02,309
Okay.

3051
04:26:02,309 --> 04:26:06,149
So let's do, let's go to camera one.

3052
04:26:06,549 --> 04:26:11,110
Where's camera two?

3053
04:26:17,100 --> 04:26:37,399
Now I got to mark it.

3054
04:26:37,399 --> 04:26:37,879
Okay.

3055
04:26:37,879 --> 04:26:55,059
Let's see how that looks.

3056
04:26:55,059 --> 04:27:06,010
Now I need the E3 backdrop here.

3057
04:27:06,010 --> 04:27:06,729
Where's the fart?

3058
04:27:06,729 --> 04:27:11,350
Well, this is not post-production yet.

3059
04:27:11,350 --> 04:27:12,389
Yeah, we can edit that part

3060
04:27:12,389 --> 04:27:14,469
because when he starts shaking his head,

3061
04:27:15,579 --> 04:27:17,450
he's at it fall forward.

3062
04:27:17,450 --> 04:27:22,440
Like right there, fall forward.

3063
04:27:22,440 --> 04:27:22,680
Okay.

3064
04:27:22,680 --> 04:27:23,479
Now let's go to the,

3065
04:27:24,280 --> 04:27:28,280
let's just go to stage again.

3066
04:27:28,280 --> 04:27:37,159
We're going to zoom in to the screen.

3067
04:27:37,159 --> 04:27:40,819
These people aren't even going to be here.

3068
04:27:40,819 --> 04:27:47,959
The backdrop is going to be just normal.

3069
04:27:47,959 --> 04:27:49,399
I guess it could change to something.

3070
04:27:59,340 --> 04:28:07,290
It just zooms into this like stupid spaceship.

3071
04:28:07,290 --> 04:28:09,129
That could, yeah, I could do a fade too.

3072
04:28:09,129 --> 04:28:14,040
Yeah, this is, I don't need this.

3073
04:28:14,040 --> 04:28:14,600
All right.

3074
04:28:14,600 --> 04:28:16,950
So we've got what we want.

3075
04:28:16,950 --> 04:28:18,229
These are all ready.

3076
04:28:18,229 --> 04:28:27,610
We're going to fade into this sci-fi corridor five.

3077
04:28:32,569 --> 04:28:34,280
Here we go.

3078
04:28:34,280 --> 04:28:35,879
This is constant conflict.

3079
04:28:41,350 --> 04:28:43,829
So first of all, there needs to be like, I don't know,

3080
04:28:43,829 --> 04:28:45,670
something to grab you immediately.

3081
04:28:45,670 --> 04:28:50,620
Somebody's getting, somebody's got CPR performed on him.

3082
04:28:50,620 --> 04:29:08,489
You're like, all right.

3083
04:29:08,489 --> 04:29:11,690
So who's in the game?

3084
04:29:12,250 --> 04:29:13,450
It's his game.

3085
04:29:13,450 --> 04:29:14,090
He's in it.

3086
04:29:14,090 --> 04:29:15,770
He's like, did the motion capture?

3087
04:29:20,280 --> 04:29:20,520
Okay.

3088
04:29:20,520 --> 04:29:21,479
This is how we need.

3089
04:29:25,079 --> 04:29:27,639
No, he can't be in his own fucking game.

3090
04:29:27,639 --> 04:29:37,030
All right.

3091
04:29:37,030 --> 04:29:38,069
Well, who was the alien?

3092
04:29:43,620 --> 04:29:44,420
Does this make sense?

3093
04:29:48,840 --> 04:29:51,799
He's giving CPR to the alien.

3094
04:29:51,799 --> 04:29:57,899
Come on.

3095
04:29:57,899 --> 04:29:59,500
Don't you die on me.

3096
04:29:59,500 --> 04:30:12,700
This is taking so, that's so long.

3097
04:30:16,459 --> 04:30:18,139
Why is he sitting here like this?

3098
04:30:21,510 --> 04:30:23,190
This is way too long.

3099
04:30:23,190 --> 04:30:30,459
Okay.

3100
04:30:30,540 --> 04:30:38,180
We need lighting, weather.

3101
04:30:39,739 --> 04:30:41,420
Fog, because everything's all fucked up.

3102
04:30:41,420 --> 04:30:42,780
This ship is going down.

3103
04:30:42,780 --> 04:30:47,670
Okay.

3104
04:30:47,670 --> 04:30:52,149
Now we need, let's get some extras in here.

3105
04:30:52,149 --> 04:30:56,649
Or maybe a supporting character.

3106
04:30:56,649 --> 04:31:09,180
No, we need, can I do like aliens and shit?

3107
04:31:09,180 --> 04:31:12,010
What about the extras?

3108
04:31:12,010 --> 04:31:14,969
Can I like, how do I make everybody like a fucking alien?

3109
04:31:23,510 --> 04:31:23,829
Fine.

3110
04:31:23,829 --> 04:31:25,110
This is the first supporting role,

3111
04:31:29,659 --> 04:31:31,739
because I have my actors, but then I have,

3112
04:31:32,459 --> 04:31:36,260
can I put some random person here?

3113
04:31:38,549 --> 04:31:39,670
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3114
04:31:40,309 --> 04:31:45,930
I can change their costumes,

3115
04:31:45,930 --> 04:31:47,770
but I can't change the extras' costumes.

3116
04:31:58,260 --> 04:31:58,500
Hmm.

3117
04:32:00,889 --> 04:32:01,370
You can?

3118
04:32:02,090 --> 04:32:06,040
How come I got this grayed out?

3119
04:32:06,040 --> 04:32:10,940
How do I do that?

3120
04:32:10,940 --> 04:32:13,100
Drag an extra there, drag them to the hanger.

3121
04:32:13,659 --> 04:32:15,479
All right.

3122
04:32:15,479 --> 04:32:19,510
So there's an extra here and then, oh fuck.

3123
04:32:19,510 --> 04:32:19,989
Okay.

3124
04:32:19,989 --> 04:32:21,030
That just kind of popped out.

3125
04:32:21,670 --> 04:32:22,870
Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3126
04:32:22,870 --> 04:32:27,989
What's going on here?

3127
04:32:27,989 --> 04:32:29,430
Why is the extra him?

3128
04:32:29,430 --> 04:32:39,610
This is strange.

3129
04:32:40,170 --> 04:32:52,840
You have to put a person as an extra.

3130
04:32:52,840 --> 04:32:58,620
Oh, so we just need, we just need like a bunch of people.

3131
04:33:01,030 --> 04:33:03,270
I don't have, I guess.

3132
04:33:03,989 --> 04:33:07,529
Can I make, can I make Jax an extra?

3133
04:33:13,290 --> 04:33:13,790
Wait.

3134
04:33:21,130 --> 04:33:21,610
Okay.

3135
04:33:21,610 --> 04:33:25,290
So I guess, I guess you're just going to be a robot,

3136
04:33:25,290 --> 04:33:30,709
but what are you defending?

3137
04:33:35,799 --> 04:33:36,040
All right.

3138
04:33:36,040 --> 04:33:37,479
We also need to have like something going on.

3139
04:33:37,479 --> 04:33:39,959
While this is happening, there has to be like a fucking explosion.

3140
04:33:43,770 --> 04:33:48,500
Stunts, fire group, a group of people run down a burning corridor,

3141
04:33:48,500 --> 04:33:58,680
explosion run, fight zombies, fire group, fire choke, fire staring, fire trap,

3142
04:33:58,680 --> 04:34:07,930
throttle victim, fire hero.

3143
04:34:07,930 --> 04:34:18,979
No, this is just, that's all there is here.

3144
04:34:21,659 --> 04:34:22,380
No, no, no, no, no.

3145
04:34:22,380 --> 04:34:23,020
Re-do this one.

3146
04:34:30,180 --> 04:34:31,139
Fight ain't over yet.

3147
04:34:31,139 --> 04:34:32,500
Ambush from above.

3148
04:34:32,500 --> 04:34:37,939
What's he holding?

3149
04:34:53,509 --> 04:34:56,540
Is that, what the hell is in his hand?

3150
04:34:56,540 --> 04:35:06,919
Is that a can opener?

3151
04:35:06,919 --> 04:35:20,150
Ambush from above.

3152
04:35:20,150 --> 04:35:22,979
What?

3153
04:35:22,979 --> 04:35:23,860
Oh, okay.

3154
04:35:23,860 --> 04:35:25,860
I'm just, what the hell happened?

3155
04:35:25,860 --> 04:35:41,319
Okay.

3156
04:35:41,319 --> 04:35:44,680
Hold on.

3157
04:35:44,680 --> 04:35:45,720
When does he land?

3158
04:35:55,110 --> 04:35:57,189
All right.

3159
04:35:57,189 --> 04:35:58,150
It's this surprise.

3160
04:35:58,150 --> 04:36:02,169
Then there's also this, and then there's ambush.

3161
04:36:02,169 --> 04:36:05,290
He spends a shitload of time knocking on his,

3162
04:36:05,290 --> 04:36:07,419
I don't even know what the hell he's holding.

3163
04:36:07,419 --> 04:36:11,450
Whatever it is.

3164
04:36:11,450 --> 04:36:11,849
Okay.

3165
04:36:11,849 --> 04:36:12,250
Hold on.

3166
04:36:28,169 --> 04:36:29,689
Spider-Man kiss.

3167
04:36:29,689 --> 04:36:31,979
Okay.

3168
04:36:31,979 --> 04:36:33,580
I don't, I don't hate this one,

3169
04:36:33,580 --> 04:36:36,060
but I'm going to trim a huge amount of it off.

3170
04:36:36,060 --> 04:36:41,159
Okay.

3171
04:36:41,159 --> 04:37:09,900
We need, I'm going to play from here.

3172
04:37:09,900 --> 04:37:13,020
Change his prop to something else, to a banana.

3173
04:37:13,020 --> 04:37:22,470
Is there, is there a way I can actually put a prop in here

3174
04:37:22,470 --> 04:37:24,950
without having to take from whatever they have?

3175
04:37:24,950 --> 04:37:29,900
Because this is the slot one.

3176
04:37:29,900 --> 04:37:32,060
So how do I, is there a way I can get a better list?

3177
04:37:32,700 --> 04:37:43,259
Apparently not.

3178
04:37:43,259 --> 04:37:46,520
Unless I can do something from another menu or something.

3179
04:37:46,520 --> 04:37:53,060
Static prop should be there, I guess.

3180
04:37:53,060 --> 04:37:53,700
I don't know why.

3181
04:37:56,099 --> 04:37:57,060
Strange.

3182
04:37:57,060 --> 04:38:01,529
All right.

3183
04:38:01,529 --> 04:38:02,569
I think this is good.

3184
04:38:02,569 --> 04:38:03,689
I'm going to use this.

3185
04:38:04,490 --> 04:38:06,490
We need to have just like a general soldier here though.

3186
04:38:07,209 --> 04:38:15,509
What is this haircut?

3187
04:38:16,150 --> 04:38:23,450
Why is he dressed like this?

3188
04:38:30,459 --> 04:38:30,700
All right.

3189
04:38:30,700 --> 04:38:31,340
It looks fine.

3190
04:38:31,979 --> 04:38:34,220
We just need this just a quick little like got you moment

3191
04:38:34,220 --> 04:38:37,750
where it's just like, bang, like right, like here.

3192
04:38:37,750 --> 04:38:50,520
Okay.

3193
04:38:50,520 --> 04:38:51,639
Let's go right there.

3194
04:38:52,279 --> 04:39:08,169
Maybe like there.

3195
04:39:08,729 --> 04:39:29,939
Okay.

3196
04:39:29,939 --> 04:39:37,540
So then like this, move the camera here.

3197
04:39:43,209 --> 04:39:44,650
That's like too much.

3198
04:39:44,650 --> 04:40:00,490
How is he, all right.

3199
04:40:00,490 --> 04:40:06,090
So then it should be there and then there.

3200
04:40:06,090 --> 04:40:08,090
Right at this right moment, like this.

3201
04:40:08,090 --> 04:40:14,169
Camera one, camera two.

3202
04:40:14,169 --> 04:40:18,310
I think that should be correct, right?

3203
04:40:22,950 --> 04:40:23,509
Yep.

3204
04:40:23,509 --> 04:40:24,779
So we'll edit it.

3205
04:40:24,779 --> 04:40:25,340
We'll have this.

3206
04:40:25,979 --> 04:40:31,849
Grab his head.

3207
04:40:31,849 --> 04:40:50,150
That second camera sucks, but it's fine because they're going to be bang.

3208
04:40:50,150 --> 04:40:56,200
Cut.

3209
04:40:56,200 --> 04:41:06,150
Let's have now like a battlefield, tropical jungle.

3210
04:41:06,150 --> 04:41:14,810
No, no, we're going to have like a war scene now on the, on a bridge, starship bridge.

3211
04:41:15,369 --> 04:41:23,639
Kill zombie.

3212
04:41:24,200 --> 04:41:28,200
No, that has to be like preparation here.

3213
04:41:28,200 --> 04:41:29,000
Fire staring.

3214
04:41:29,000 --> 04:41:30,279
Someone stares through the fire.

3215
04:41:35,380 --> 04:41:39,159
We need, let's take off stunts.

3216
04:41:39,159 --> 04:41:44,889
Let's just do violence.

3217
04:41:44,889 --> 04:41:45,849
Drink react.

3218
04:41:45,849 --> 04:41:46,729
Drink poison.

3219
04:41:49,909 --> 04:41:51,110
Explosion reaction.

3220
04:41:53,849 --> 04:41:55,450
Firing blanks.

3221
04:41:55,450 --> 04:42:01,740
Shooting dance.

3222
04:42:02,299 --> 04:42:07,479
Wait, what do you mean shooting dance?

3223
04:42:22,139 --> 04:42:23,819
How do you act professional here?

3224
04:42:38,939 --> 04:42:42,619
Okay, he's, he's doing the Carlton.

3225
04:42:42,619 --> 04:42:43,580
How, what is that?

3226
04:42:43,580 --> 04:42:44,220
Professional.

3227
04:43:36,340 --> 04:43:40,340
All right, this has to be somebody.

3228
04:43:41,220 --> 04:43:44,150
Now you're going to be in a different costume than this.

3229
04:44:08,229 --> 04:44:09,509
And this is going to be like an extra.

3230
04:44:09,509 --> 04:44:10,869
Like this is what they, this is what they do to humans.

3231
04:44:10,869 --> 04:44:12,310
They fucking like torture them.

3232
04:44:18,630 --> 04:44:19,830
What is this guy doing over here?

3233
04:44:32,900 --> 04:44:34,819
Torture by bullying people.

3234
04:44:35,459 --> 04:44:40,099
Okay, that's fine.

3235
04:44:40,740 --> 04:44:50,520
And then we need, yeah, I'm going to, don't worry.

3236
04:44:50,520 --> 04:44:52,840
I'll have a subtitle that says that.

3237
04:44:56,680 --> 04:44:58,279
Not actual gameplay.

3238
04:45:10,709 --> 04:45:21,909
I'm going to have him run through like eight different corridors like this.

3239
04:45:22,549 --> 04:45:34,419
Starship bridge one, same thing.

3240
04:45:34,419 --> 04:45:36,419
I just want explosion, explosion run.

3241
04:45:54,490 --> 04:45:55,290
Okay, that's fine.

3242
04:45:56,090 --> 04:45:57,180
What is this called?

3243
04:45:58,459 --> 04:46:00,700
This is called explosive run.

3244
04:46:10,869 --> 04:46:13,110
Come on, give me some more explosive runs.

3245
04:46:17,740 --> 04:46:21,060
Shit, I wanted to run through like five different corridors.

3246
04:46:22,200 --> 04:46:26,139
I guess I could just have him do the same one over and over again.

3247
04:46:30,860 --> 04:46:37,779
What is it?

3248
04:46:37,779 --> 04:46:40,619
Starship four, corridor five, maybe.

3249
04:46:44,340 --> 04:46:45,459
Bullet run, explode.

3250
04:46:45,459 --> 04:46:45,779
Here we go.

3251
04:46:45,779 --> 04:46:46,500
Here's another, there we go.

3252
04:46:46,500 --> 04:46:47,000
Perfect.

3253
04:46:58,630 --> 04:47:06,659
Okay, sci-fi corridor, corridor one, corridor.

3254
04:47:06,659 --> 04:47:09,939
He just goes, he's running around the whole entire fucking.

3255
04:47:14,340 --> 04:47:30,439
Is it the same one?

3256
04:47:30,439 --> 04:47:31,000
No.

3257
04:47:35,610 --> 04:47:37,130
Yeah, make him run through somewhere else.

3258
04:47:38,169 --> 04:47:40,169
Yeah, make him run through like a living room.

3259
04:47:41,209 --> 04:47:43,049
Is there like a sprint through a living room?

3260
04:47:52,220 --> 04:47:53,180
It's too short.

3261
04:47:53,979 --> 04:47:54,459
Hold on.

3262
04:47:55,180 --> 04:48:09,779
Location two, smiling.

3263
04:48:22,599 --> 04:48:39,669
Okay, all right.

3264
04:48:39,669 --> 04:48:54,919
Now we're back to the explosions.

3265
04:48:54,919 --> 04:49:05,930
Corridor four, corridor, no, no, no.

3266
04:49:05,930 --> 04:49:16,220
Back to corridor, should he just run by the stage with his own body on it?

3267
04:49:16,220 --> 04:49:17,500
All right, moving, what about car?

3268
04:49:23,189 --> 04:49:24,790
He's like just in the world.

3269
04:49:24,790 --> 04:49:26,729
All right, let's go, let's see what, can I do that?

3270
04:49:27,369 --> 04:49:34,900
Let's go to stage.

3271
04:49:54,360 --> 04:49:56,279
Why does, this doesn't make any sense.

3272
04:50:01,130 --> 04:50:08,759
Constant fucking conflict.

3273
04:50:08,759 --> 04:50:10,520
Yeah, and we're gonna have like an alien, like he,

3274
04:50:10,520 --> 04:50:12,520
this is, the trailer is behind him here.

3275
04:50:12,520 --> 04:50:17,479
You know what I mean?

3276
04:50:17,479 --> 04:50:23,669
Like this is, the trailer is behind him.

3277
04:50:23,669 --> 04:50:38,220
There's the spaceship.

3278
04:50:38,220 --> 04:50:39,259
All right, now we're gonna have,

3279
04:50:39,259 --> 04:50:49,849
well, okay, almost time for the trailer to be over.

3280
04:50:49,849 --> 04:50:51,689
Why would it zoom in on this?

3281
04:50:56,419 --> 04:50:58,419
Action, moderate, action, heavy.

3282
04:50:58,900 --> 04:51:01,779
Oh my, he's kicking the shit out of him.

3283
04:51:07,400 --> 04:51:08,599
Is it, what's after that?

3284
04:51:08,599 --> 04:51:15,220
There's extreme, from that reaction shot.

3285
04:51:22,840 --> 04:51:24,200
I don't understand that one.

3286
04:51:27,819 --> 04:51:29,580
He breaks his neck back again.

3287
04:51:30,380 --> 04:51:34,779
I think I like heavy because heavy, there's just more punches.

3288
04:51:41,959 --> 04:51:43,560
Okay, this also needs to be,

3289
04:51:43,560 --> 04:51:46,979
you're gonna be in a different costume here.

3290
04:51:46,979 --> 04:51:48,020
You're gonna be like one of the aliens.

3291
04:51:49,860 --> 04:51:51,459
Am I, am I fucking this whole thing up?

3292
04:51:52,259 --> 04:51:52,819
I might be.

3293
04:52:00,250 --> 04:52:19,240
I think it's Mysterio, far from home.

3294
04:52:19,240 --> 04:52:29,529
That's my favorite part, when he just like drops him.

3295
04:52:30,869 --> 04:52:32,790
Do you realize when he lands on this ground,

3296
04:52:32,790 --> 04:52:34,869
I'm gonna make a loud, awful thud.

3297
04:52:35,590 --> 04:52:38,630
Like crashes and glass breaking because of the head.

3298
04:52:40,360 --> 04:53:07,259
Just like, all right, okay.

3299
04:53:07,259 --> 04:53:09,180
The first trailer is almost over.

3300
04:53:09,180 --> 04:53:23,669
What is this?

3301
04:53:28,150 --> 04:53:31,049
Picnic, let's see, what do they got for stunts?

3302
04:53:32,779 --> 04:53:34,459
Horse riders shot?

3303
04:53:34,459 --> 04:53:37,220
What do you mean horse riders shot?

3304
04:53:44,740 --> 04:53:46,419
Why would there be a horse here?

3305
04:53:47,060 --> 04:53:54,009
What's location two?

3306
04:53:54,810 --> 04:54:01,380
I like location one better.

3307
04:54:01,380 --> 04:54:12,119
Okay, we got, that prop has to, no, no, no.

3308
04:54:12,119 --> 04:54:15,659
Lighting, this is fine.

3309
04:54:15,659 --> 04:54:21,540
Weather, wind, strong wind.

3310
04:54:29,930 --> 04:54:31,770
A bunch of trash.

3311
04:54:36,220 --> 04:54:37,979
That's so much trash.

3312
04:54:45,860 --> 04:54:47,779
What the shit did he plant it?

3313
04:54:51,540 --> 04:54:56,340
It's like plastic bags.

3314
04:55:04,220 --> 04:55:16,229
Well, this has to be, he's gotta be, oh my god.

3315
04:55:32,409 --> 04:55:33,849
This is so dirty.

3316
04:55:35,209 --> 04:55:42,299
Wait, wait, why does he fall twice?

3317
04:55:49,580 --> 04:55:53,900
Okay, looking good.

3318
04:55:53,900 --> 04:56:04,650
Let me just make sure that this shit's still looking okay.

3319
04:56:04,650 --> 04:56:13,189
There it is.

3320
04:56:13,189 --> 04:56:21,130
What happened to the camera here?

3321
04:56:21,130 --> 04:56:22,889
Didn't I make, didn't I change this?

3322
04:56:30,090 --> 04:56:31,290
I thought I had this changed.

3323
04:56:31,290 --> 04:56:38,250
That's weird.

3324
04:56:38,250 --> 04:56:42,250
It should be there, right?

3325
04:56:42,250 --> 04:56:43,689
All right, that's it for the trailer.

3326
04:56:43,689 --> 04:56:45,369
Now we're gonna go, let's go back to the stage

3327
04:56:52,150 --> 04:56:58,939
and we're introducing our new game.

3328
04:56:58,939 --> 04:57:00,860
There's two games to show at this E3.

3329
04:57:00,860 --> 04:57:13,430
Is it like medic or, hold on, I need,

3330
04:57:15,659 --> 04:57:23,060
we need loving or showing a card.

3331
04:57:23,060 --> 04:57:27,900
Resolution, take off pursuit and loving.

3332
04:57:27,900 --> 04:57:35,220
Resolution, okay, here we go.

3333
04:57:35,220 --> 04:57:53,529
And then we're gonna go to the next trail.

3334
04:57:53,529 --> 04:58:12,299
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, come here.

3335
04:58:12,299 --> 04:58:15,180
I'm gonna like record a dialogue of me being like,

3336
04:58:15,180 --> 04:58:17,740
this conference sucks.

3337
04:58:17,740 --> 04:58:18,779
Fuck your company.

3338
04:58:24,069 --> 04:58:29,720
All right, so new game, we'll fade into this one,

3339
04:58:29,720 --> 04:58:35,720
is gonna be, who am I gonna put in this?

3340
04:58:38,970 --> 04:58:47,930
Should it just be another conflict game?

3341
04:58:47,930 --> 04:58:52,069
It's the same one.

3342
04:58:52,069 --> 04:58:53,270
Make it western.

3343
04:58:53,270 --> 04:58:56,819
Saloon bedroom.

3344
04:58:56,819 --> 04:58:57,860
Make a dating sim.

3345
04:59:01,689 --> 04:59:02,889
Scrolling landscape.

3346
04:59:03,689 --> 04:59:04,810
Just like a driving game.

3347
04:59:05,450 --> 04:59:13,060
Yeah, a driving game.

3348
04:59:13,060 --> 04:59:15,459
And don't worry, there'll be constant conflict in this game.

3349
04:59:17,299 --> 04:59:25,430
Street, okay, vehicle, car.

3350
04:59:35,060 --> 04:59:37,619
He's not gonna star in his own game again.

3351
04:59:37,619 --> 04:59:54,069
Mood, what?

3352
04:59:54,069 --> 05:00:05,029
Why would you wait that long to detonate a car bomb?

3353
05:00:08,409 --> 05:00:11,130
Wouldn't it explode way before?

3354
05:00:19,669 --> 05:00:21,830
That's the conflict.

3355
05:00:21,830 --> 05:00:23,110
Why wouldn't it, why?

3356
05:00:34,229 --> 05:00:35,590
All right, wait, hold on, wait, wait, wait.

3357
05:00:35,590 --> 05:00:51,880
We're going, there's just no clothes on.

3358
05:00:51,880 --> 05:00:52,919
He's just like naked.

3359
05:00:59,529 --> 05:01:00,970
Uh, what do we want?

3360
05:01:00,970 --> 05:01:05,639
No, this is a driving game.

3361
05:01:05,639 --> 05:01:20,099
There can't be this much constant conflict.

3362
05:01:20,099 --> 05:01:20,900
How do you sneak?

3363
05:01:39,299 --> 05:01:40,500
What was that?

3364
05:01:40,500 --> 05:01:41,220
Ice cream.

3365
05:01:44,439 --> 05:01:48,759
City street.

3366
05:01:48,759 --> 05:01:49,880
All right, this is the driving.

3367
05:01:49,880 --> 05:01:52,630
I need to do a driving game.

3368
05:01:52,630 --> 05:02:06,099
I can't just let it go off the rails.

3369
05:02:06,099 --> 05:02:15,880
Car burnout.

3370
05:02:15,880 --> 05:02:29,099
All right, that's a pretty good start.

3371
05:02:29,099 --> 05:02:30,459
Not a taxi though.

3372
05:02:30,459 --> 05:02:32,619
If it's a driving game, it needs to be something cool.

3373
05:02:32,619 --> 05:02:36,819
All right, this is pretty nice.

3374
05:02:42,889 --> 05:02:45,130
He's got to be in different, not different clothes.

3375
05:02:45,689 --> 05:02:53,180
What was he in?

3376
05:02:53,180 --> 05:02:54,779
Yeah, no, this is fine.

3377
05:02:54,779 --> 05:02:55,340
Right here.

3378
05:02:55,340 --> 05:03:18,869
All right, that looks good.

3379
05:03:18,869 --> 05:03:20,330
It's a good start.

3380
05:03:20,330 --> 05:03:22,569
That's going to go, okay, same thing.

3381
05:03:22,569 --> 05:03:23,610
Urban city street.

3382
05:03:23,610 --> 05:03:29,369
It's more like peeling out and cool shit.

3383
05:03:29,369 --> 05:03:30,009
Car squeeze.

3384
05:03:30,009 --> 05:03:30,409
What's that?

3385
05:03:30,409 --> 05:03:31,700
Car squeeze?

3386
05:03:31,700 --> 05:03:33,619
Lots of people comically squeeze into a car.

3387
05:03:35,990 --> 05:03:38,310
Just, just get it out of the way immediately.

3388
05:03:44,459 --> 05:03:45,819
Should I just get it out of the way?

3389
05:03:45,819 --> 05:03:46,860
Should I get it out of the way?

3390
05:03:50,310 --> 05:03:55,110
Should we fill the car with clowns and then just have them get in it?

3391
05:03:55,110 --> 05:03:57,029
No, it can't be like this already.

3392
05:04:18,549 --> 05:04:19,830
Does he have different hair?

3393
05:04:20,470 --> 05:04:34,840
Don't worry.

3394
05:04:34,840 --> 05:04:35,560
I'll get it.

3395
05:04:35,560 --> 05:04:37,159
I'll, we'll get the call back.

3396
05:04:37,159 --> 05:04:37,639
Don't worry.

3397
05:04:37,639 --> 05:04:38,439
Here's the call back.

3398
05:04:39,159 --> 05:04:54,470
It's never not funny.

3399
05:04:54,470 --> 05:04:55,029
It's not.

3400
05:04:55,750 --> 05:04:56,869
It's never not fun.

3401
05:04:56,869 --> 05:04:59,290
It's never not funny.

3402
05:04:59,290 --> 05:05:00,970
Constant fucking conflict.

3403
05:05:03,540 --> 05:05:05,619
We need to, I need to be able to edit this together though.

3404
05:05:07,500 --> 05:05:07,979
Hold on.

3405
05:05:10,009 --> 05:05:10,729
Some driving.

3406
05:05:12,090 --> 05:05:15,700
Where's the clown?

3407
05:05:15,700 --> 05:05:17,060
Like comical clown one.

3408
05:05:22,169 --> 05:05:22,970
Car squeeze.

3409
05:05:43,189 --> 05:05:44,709
It's a normal.

3410
05:05:44,709 --> 05:05:45,029
Okay.

3411
05:05:46,619 --> 05:05:47,580
Oh Jesus.

3412
05:06:24,569 --> 05:06:24,889
Okay.

3413
05:06:24,889 --> 05:06:27,159
Close the door.

3414
05:06:27,159 --> 05:06:30,869
But I think I need to put, hold on.

3415
05:06:30,869 --> 05:06:34,259
It's the same people that were in the last game.

3416
05:06:34,259 --> 05:06:45,540
I need a fucking clown costume.

3417
05:06:45,540 --> 05:06:52,099
Is it a monster?

3418
05:06:56,580 --> 05:06:57,060
Premium.

3419
05:07:09,770 --> 05:07:10,330
Where is it?

3420
05:07:27,159 --> 05:07:28,840
There are so many costumes.

3421
05:07:28,840 --> 05:07:30,119
Can I just type in clown?

3422
05:07:37,349 --> 05:07:38,229
Where's the clown?

3423
05:07:38,229 --> 05:07:39,029
Where's the clown?

3424
05:07:39,029 --> 05:07:39,750
Where's the clown?

3425
05:07:39,750 --> 05:07:40,470
Where's the clown?

3426
05:07:41,029 --> 05:07:46,900
Okay, I found it.

3427
05:07:46,900 --> 05:07:59,060
Okay.

3428
05:07:59,060 --> 05:08:02,740
There we go.

3429
05:08:02,740 --> 05:08:15,060
So here comes the one clown.

3430
05:08:15,060 --> 05:08:17,220
Everyone is just going to be in the same clown costume.

3431
05:08:28,099 --> 05:08:30,180
I got to get like a good, where is it?

3432
05:08:30,180 --> 05:08:33,349
What would it actually be under?

3433
05:08:33,349 --> 05:08:34,389
Not casual, right?

3434
05:08:35,029 --> 05:08:44,409
Formal work.

3435
05:08:44,409 --> 05:09:06,150
So only like a few people need to be in clown costumes.

3436
05:09:06,150 --> 05:09:14,169
All of them.

3437
05:09:14,169 --> 05:09:16,090
What does this have to do with the game?

3438
05:09:16,090 --> 05:09:38,599
I don't think I can even make these other extras

3439
05:09:38,599 --> 05:09:40,939
because I don't have them set as anybody.

3440
05:09:40,939 --> 05:10:04,060
Okay.

3441
05:10:04,139 --> 05:10:06,840
One, two, three, four.

3442
05:10:12,419 --> 05:10:16,540
Wait, is it going to be this?

3443
05:10:16,540 --> 05:10:19,659
No, it's not going to work.

3444
05:10:19,659 --> 05:10:38,330
I don't have enough extras.

3445
05:10:38,330 --> 05:10:39,849
Is there no clown costume?

3446
05:10:39,849 --> 05:10:55,740
Hold on.

3447
05:10:55,740 --> 05:10:56,380
Why?

3448
05:10:56,380 --> 05:11:01,990
I can't have a woman in a clown costume?

3449
05:11:01,990 --> 05:11:04,619
That seems to make no sense.

3450
05:11:12,810 --> 05:11:19,299
Uh, I mean, I don't know.

3451
05:11:19,299 --> 05:11:20,659
There has to be a clown.

3452
05:11:29,560 --> 05:11:45,700
Uh, I guess I don't.

3453
05:11:45,700 --> 05:11:50,599
Wait, hold on.

3454
05:11:50,599 --> 05:12:17,990
One, two, three, four, five.

3455
05:12:17,990 --> 05:12:26,250
What if it's just some of them just regular people?

3456
05:12:26,250 --> 05:12:28,630
I can fix this later.

3457
05:12:28,630 --> 05:12:32,330
Um, all right.

3458
05:12:33,209 --> 05:12:34,810
First of all, this needs to be changed.

3459
05:12:55,020 --> 05:12:56,619
It's like I have a different hair.

3460
05:12:56,619 --> 05:12:58,779
I mean, see?

3461
05:13:03,990 --> 05:13:04,630
Okay.

3462
05:13:04,630 --> 05:13:09,020
I also, okay, urban office.

3463
05:13:09,020 --> 05:13:09,740
No, no, no.

3464
05:13:09,740 --> 05:13:12,939
Miniature city.

3465
05:13:12,939 --> 05:13:13,979
Cars race.

3466
05:13:13,979 --> 05:13:14,700
Here we go.

3467
05:13:15,259 --> 05:13:18,299
Perfect.

3468
05:13:18,299 --> 05:13:21,020
Oh, look at this.

3469
05:13:21,020 --> 05:13:22,860
This is exactly what I wanted.

3470
05:13:22,860 --> 05:13:49,849
Where's the car I was already using?

3471
05:13:49,849 --> 05:13:50,970
EMT.

3472
05:13:50,970 --> 05:13:51,209
All right.

3473
05:13:51,209 --> 05:13:53,659
That looks good.

3474
05:13:53,659 --> 05:13:53,979
Okay.

3475
05:13:56,009 --> 05:13:56,409
Same thing.

3476
05:13:56,409 --> 05:14:03,270
Let's do the miniature city again.

3477
05:14:03,270 --> 05:14:04,470
Car skid.

3478
05:14:04,470 --> 05:14:08,619
Cars race.

3479
05:14:08,619 --> 05:14:09,500
Car traffic.

3480
05:14:12,009 --> 05:14:14,250
City, city explosion.

3481
05:14:18,599 --> 05:14:19,400
Establish the city.

3482
05:14:19,400 --> 05:14:20,919
We could do like a pull it back.

3483
05:14:21,939 --> 05:14:23,060
Tracking show off to the city.

3484
05:14:23,060 --> 05:14:23,860
That sounds pretty good.

3485
05:14:33,430 --> 05:14:33,909
Forwards.

3486
05:14:34,549 --> 05:14:35,349
Perspective two.

3487
05:14:36,069 --> 05:14:36,869
There we go.

3488
05:14:36,869 --> 05:14:37,110
Nice.

3489
05:14:45,900 --> 05:14:46,779
And the speed up.

3490
05:14:47,900 --> 05:14:53,610
And then let's do inside the car.

3491
05:14:54,250 --> 05:15:03,659
What stunts have we got?

3492
05:15:03,659 --> 05:15:04,299
Car chase.

3493
05:15:05,619 --> 05:15:06,580
Car chase rear.

3494
05:15:09,750 --> 05:15:10,549
Gear change.

3495
05:15:10,549 --> 05:15:11,270
Dashboard.

3496
05:15:14,520 --> 05:15:16,439
Radio, radio answer.

3497
05:15:18,779 --> 05:15:20,900
Car sudden stop.

3498
05:15:20,900 --> 05:15:30,180
Let's see what this looks like.

3499
05:15:30,180 --> 05:15:30,819
Turning.

3500
05:15:30,819 --> 05:15:31,299
Braking.

3501
05:15:38,060 --> 05:15:39,340
You've done that before.

3502
05:15:39,340 --> 05:15:48,409
All right.

3503
05:15:48,409 --> 05:15:56,540
Who the fuck was even in the car?

3504
05:15:56,540 --> 05:15:57,259
Which one was it?

3505
05:15:57,259 --> 05:15:58,299
It was this one.

3506
05:15:58,299 --> 05:15:58,860
No, it wasn't.

3507
05:16:00,759 --> 05:16:01,880
It was like a nice car.

3508
05:16:01,880 --> 05:16:02,520
Like this one.

3509
05:16:02,520 --> 05:16:04,970
This one right here.

3510
05:16:04,970 --> 05:16:06,490
And I have no idea who was in the car.

3511
05:16:07,639 --> 05:16:07,959
Oh yeah.

3512
05:16:07,959 --> 05:16:09,000
There was like a bunch of clowns.

3513
05:16:09,720 --> 05:16:12,069
All right.

3514
05:16:12,069 --> 05:16:13,909
Before this derails completely.

3515
05:16:14,549 --> 05:16:20,060
I think it was you.

3516
05:16:20,060 --> 05:16:20,700
No, it was you.

3517
05:16:39,689 --> 05:16:40,729
Like it hasn't already.

3518
05:16:40,729 --> 05:16:41,849
Well, not completely.

3519
05:16:42,650 --> 05:16:45,580
Okay.

3520
05:16:46,220 --> 05:16:48,700
So there's a big break.

3521
05:16:48,700 --> 05:16:55,349
This is going to take a fucking ton of editing.

3522
05:16:55,349 --> 05:16:56,229
But it's going to be worth it.

3523
05:16:56,869 --> 05:17:03,799
City block corridor.

3524
05:17:03,799 --> 05:17:10,250
Nature city again.

3525
05:17:19,740 --> 05:17:21,540
Car traffic.

3526
05:17:32,779 --> 05:17:34,139
There's no other.

3527
05:17:34,139 --> 05:17:34,939
This is the only one.

3528
05:17:36,900 --> 05:17:38,659
I wonder whose car this is supposed to be.

3529
05:17:47,290 --> 05:18:08,330
Let's go into the camera.

3530
05:18:08,330 --> 05:18:08,970
Oh, easy.

3531
05:18:09,290 --> 05:18:31,180
I want a good view of this.

3532
05:18:31,180 --> 05:18:38,869
Too much movement.

3533
05:18:43,560 --> 05:18:59,349
All right.

3534
05:18:59,349 --> 05:19:00,229
Let's start here.

3535
05:19:00,229 --> 05:19:01,509
And then I'm going to go in.

3536
05:19:01,509 --> 05:19:05,020
Why are they not moving?

3537
05:19:05,020 --> 05:19:08,569
Oh God.

3538
05:19:08,569 --> 05:19:09,930
They're like little set pieces.

3539
05:19:09,930 --> 05:19:10,729
That's why.

3540
05:19:10,729 --> 05:19:25,500
Where is it all the way down there?

3541
05:19:31,259 --> 05:19:32,459
Cars are like little bugs.

3542
05:19:32,459 --> 05:19:34,139
I actually just like the static right here.

3543
05:19:40,939 --> 05:19:41,659
This is parked.

3544
05:19:48,139 --> 05:19:48,380
All right.

3545
05:19:48,380 --> 05:19:50,299
And then finally we're going to have.

3546
05:19:50,299 --> 05:19:59,180
Let's go back to the street.

3547
05:19:59,180 --> 05:20:02,279
Car parking.

3548
05:20:02,279 --> 05:20:03,479
Exit car collapse.

3549
05:20:18,060 --> 05:20:18,459
All right.

3550
05:20:19,720 --> 05:20:28,299
Let's have it.

3551
05:20:28,299 --> 05:20:29,900
I guess we'll keep the clown theme here.

3552
05:20:40,069 --> 05:20:43,509
Needs to be the right car, which I mean.

3553
05:20:43,509 --> 05:20:46,360
This is as close as I can get it, I think.

3554
05:20:46,360 --> 05:20:47,240
I can get it.

3555
05:20:47,240 --> 05:20:58,900
Okay.

3556
05:20:58,900 --> 05:21:01,720
And then last.

3557
05:21:02,599 --> 05:21:04,040
This is going to be long.

3558
05:21:04,040 --> 05:21:05,080
It's it'll be worth it.

3559
05:21:05,080 --> 05:21:16,389
It'd be worth it.

3560
05:21:16,389 --> 05:21:17,430
Last thing.

3561
05:21:17,430 --> 05:21:24,740
Car jump.

3562
05:21:24,740 --> 05:21:33,779
Car crashes around a corner and slides onto its roof under attack.

3563
05:21:42,970 --> 05:21:43,930
He's got to drive through.

3564
05:21:44,650 --> 05:21:48,389
He's going to be driving through when it explodes.

3565
05:21:48,389 --> 05:21:55,400
Can I make this look a little?

3566
05:21:55,400 --> 05:21:56,599
Like a spaceship car?

3567
05:21:56,599 --> 05:22:03,380
This is going in the other scene.

3568
05:22:03,380 --> 05:22:13,290
This is in the other game.

3569
05:22:13,290 --> 05:22:22,009
This is going back.

3570
05:22:22,009 --> 05:22:22,490
All right.

3571
05:22:22,490 --> 05:22:31,930
And finally, we're not going to use all these clips.

3572
05:22:31,930 --> 05:22:33,290
I just want to make sure I have them.

3573
05:22:33,290 --> 05:22:42,470
I need just like driving.

3574
05:22:42,470 --> 05:22:47,500
Here we go.

3575
05:22:47,500 --> 05:23:02,340
It's a very slow drive, but it'll work.

3576
05:23:02,340 --> 05:23:09,020
Just aliens.

3577
05:23:21,000 --> 05:23:21,799
This is the intro.

3578
05:23:22,520 --> 05:23:25,240
This is where it says not gameplay footage.

3579
05:23:25,240 --> 05:23:42,819
Okay.

3580
05:23:43,459 --> 05:23:47,880
I don't know what that's about.

3581
05:23:49,049 --> 05:23:51,220
Okay.

3582
05:23:51,220 --> 05:23:52,819
We've got enough there.

3583
05:23:52,819 --> 05:23:58,709
It's time to bring it back to the stage and wrap up the E3 presentation.

3584
05:24:27,189 --> 05:24:32,259
And then let's go back here.

3585
05:24:33,380 --> 05:24:34,340
That's fine.

3586
05:24:34,340 --> 05:24:37,240
Now we need somebody else to come out and just say goodbye.

3587
05:24:37,240 --> 05:25:12,869
Put the camera back over this way.

3588
05:25:12,869 --> 05:25:21,939
That's fine.

3589
05:25:21,939 --> 05:25:22,419
Right there.

3590
05:25:28,860 --> 05:25:29,659
All right.

3591
05:25:29,659 --> 05:25:38,979
And then we need stage again.

3592
05:25:55,369 --> 05:25:56,009
Different hair.

3593
05:26:09,060 --> 05:26:09,380
Hair.

3594
05:26:11,659 --> 05:26:12,380
How do I?

3595
05:26:12,380 --> 05:26:12,540
Okay.

3596
05:26:12,540 --> 05:26:13,419
I got to make it.

3597
05:26:13,419 --> 05:26:15,259
I'm just going to make this the person, I guess.

3598
05:26:16,389 --> 05:26:32,979
Does he come on and change on stage?

3599
05:26:32,979 --> 05:26:43,029
What the hell was it called again?

3600
05:26:44,540 --> 05:26:50,630
There it is.

3601
05:26:50,630 --> 05:26:51,270
All right.

3602
05:26:51,270 --> 05:26:51,509
Done.

3603
05:27:02,009 --> 05:27:09,540
I'm not even going to dub over this.

3604
05:27:11,380 --> 05:27:30,340
And let's like, hold on.

3605
05:27:30,340 --> 05:27:30,979
I want to do something.

3606
05:27:30,979 --> 05:27:31,779
I want one more thing.

3607
05:27:35,880 --> 05:27:36,520
Let me just see.

3608
05:27:37,080 --> 05:27:51,860
I want somebody just on the computer.

3609
05:27:52,580 --> 05:27:54,580
Like at the desk or a computer.

3610
05:28:01,979 --> 05:28:14,310
Computer hacking.

3611
05:28:17,430 --> 05:28:23,689
The gorilla hacking, the gorilla watching E3.

3612
05:28:28,220 --> 05:28:28,700
Yeah.

3613
05:28:28,700 --> 05:28:31,500
And writing a bunch of mean shit on like Reddit.

3614
05:28:31,580 --> 05:28:33,500
He's really pissed off about what he just saw.

3615
05:28:40,779 --> 05:28:43,259
I can't fucking believe what they showed here.

3616
05:28:43,259 --> 05:28:48,599
You know, I really was, look, I was hoping for Yoshi's Bully World 2.

3617
05:28:53,590 --> 05:28:53,750
Yeah.

3618
05:28:53,750 --> 05:28:54,709
He's on Reddit.

3619
05:28:54,709 --> 05:29:05,180
All right.

3620
05:29:05,180 --> 05:29:13,060
So we need to have, does this just be a lizard?

3621
05:29:17,220 --> 05:29:18,819
Search bar Reddit.

3622
05:29:18,819 --> 05:29:19,540
Yeah.

3623
05:29:19,540 --> 05:29:20,180
We'll put it in.

3624
05:29:51,930 --> 05:29:57,689
They didn't announce his favorite game.

3625
05:29:57,689 --> 05:30:02,900
Oh, there you go.

3626
05:30:02,900 --> 05:30:09,319
Miss E3 sucked.

3627
05:30:09,319 --> 05:30:09,720
All right.

3628
05:30:09,720 --> 05:30:20,439
Now it's my job to put this all together.

3629
05:30:20,439 --> 05:30:20,680
Yeah.

3630
05:30:20,680 --> 05:30:22,599
I'll make sure there's a lot of extras.

3631
05:30:23,979 --> 05:30:25,580
So that, this should be good.

3632
05:30:25,580 --> 05:30:28,040
I don't think there's anything else.

3633
05:30:28,040 --> 05:30:33,799
I'm pretty sure I have every scene I need.

3634
05:30:33,799 --> 05:30:43,000
I think.

3635
05:30:43,000 --> 05:30:45,240
I believe it's time to go back.

3636
05:30:46,860 --> 05:30:47,419
Confirm.

3637
05:30:50,360 --> 05:30:50,759
Save it.

3638
05:30:50,759 --> 05:30:51,319
I will.

3639
05:30:51,319 --> 05:30:51,639
I will.

3640
05:30:51,639 --> 05:30:52,279
Don't worry.

3641
05:30:52,279 --> 05:30:54,840
Don't worry.

3642
05:30:54,840 --> 05:30:55,080
Save.

3643
05:30:55,799 --> 05:30:57,959
I have to like confirm an exit before I can save.

3644
05:31:00,139 --> 05:31:02,459
Did I miss a backdrop somewhere?

3645
05:31:02,459 --> 05:31:04,380
Maybe I did, but whatever.

3646
05:31:04,380 --> 05:31:07,340
Here we go.

3647
05:31:14,619 --> 05:31:15,819
It is ready for casting.

3648
05:31:16,700 --> 05:31:20,680
I'm going to save the game.

3649
05:31:24,380 --> 05:31:28,759
Let's just call this one P Pants 2.

3650
05:31:30,040 --> 05:31:30,439
All right.

3651
05:31:32,419 --> 05:31:34,819
So let's get this in the, let's get some extras.

3652
05:31:35,619 --> 05:31:42,119
I need to go to the, where the hiring is.

3653
05:31:44,869 --> 05:31:46,470
Create, I need crew, right?

3654
05:31:49,619 --> 05:31:50,659
I need extras.

3655
05:31:51,220 --> 05:31:57,750
Does that matter?

3656
05:31:58,310 --> 05:32:00,549
Or will it fill it automatically?

3657
05:32:01,110 --> 05:32:07,180
I guess we'll find out.

3658
05:32:07,180 --> 05:32:08,459
Because I can't drag them over here.

3659
05:32:08,459 --> 05:32:11,849
I need to cast to start getting extras.

3660
05:32:11,849 --> 05:32:12,169
Okay.

3661
05:32:13,209 --> 05:32:13,450
All right.

3662
05:32:13,450 --> 05:32:13,930
Let's do it.

3663
05:32:17,139 --> 05:32:18,500
Begin casting.

3664
05:32:21,209 --> 05:32:21,610
Extras.

3665
05:32:21,610 --> 05:32:23,290
I need 11 extras.

3666
05:32:29,049 --> 05:32:31,130
Can I even have this many people?

3667
05:32:31,130 --> 05:32:38,069
How do I get extras?

3668
05:32:47,659 --> 05:32:48,700
I need more crew.

3669
05:32:54,229 --> 05:32:57,110
Now I need extras, but I can't pull these guys into extras.

3670
05:32:58,150 --> 05:32:58,950
Just birth them.

3671
05:32:59,669 --> 05:33:11,430
I need, I need a director.

3672
05:33:11,430 --> 05:33:12,229
Well, I have one here.

3673
05:33:13,110 --> 05:33:17,700
And now I need the extras.

3674
05:33:20,279 --> 05:33:22,040
Don't they usually hang out in front of here?

3675
05:33:34,099 --> 05:33:38,580
Because there's somebody here.

3676
05:33:39,220 --> 05:33:40,659
But I can't add them to extras.

3677
05:33:40,659 --> 05:33:40,819
Why?

3678
05:33:44,220 --> 05:33:46,459
I have to go to the stage school to create extras.

3679
05:33:46,459 --> 05:33:47,659
Where the hell is that one?

3680
05:33:48,540 --> 05:33:52,409
They hang out in front of one of the buildings.

3681
05:33:53,689 --> 05:33:54,569
Stunt school.

3682
05:33:55,290 --> 05:33:56,729
I think I'm going to need some stuntmen.

3683
05:33:59,610 --> 05:34:01,610
I need a stunt, I need stunt doubles.

3684
05:34:01,610 --> 05:34:12,279
Okay.

3685
05:34:12,840 --> 05:34:16,810
What about over here?

3686
05:34:17,849 --> 05:34:19,689
Oh, here we go.

3687
05:34:21,750 --> 05:34:22,869
Stars and studios.

3688
05:34:22,869 --> 05:34:23,430
Reject.

3689
05:34:24,150 --> 05:34:24,869
Movie making?

3690
05:34:24,869 --> 05:34:25,110
No.

3691
05:34:25,750 --> 05:34:27,770
What are these people?

3692
05:34:27,770 --> 05:34:34,569
I mean, these people are just hanging out here.

3693
05:34:38,520 --> 05:34:40,200
Import, start, create, extra.

3694
05:34:41,000 --> 05:34:49,639
I need more.

3695
05:34:54,790 --> 05:34:55,909
I'm working on it.

3696
05:35:06,139 --> 05:35:13,580
We good?

3697
05:35:14,700 --> 05:35:16,220
I need one more extra.

3698
05:35:17,020 --> 05:35:19,959
I have enough stuntmen, right?

3699
05:35:20,599 --> 05:35:22,409
I should, don't I?

3700
05:35:23,130 --> 05:35:27,130
I need one more extra.

3701
05:35:27,930 --> 05:35:29,779
I need sci-fi corridor.

3702
05:35:29,779 --> 05:35:31,939
Actor does not, does own stunts.

3703
05:35:31,939 --> 05:35:33,139
Actor does own stunts.

3704
05:35:33,779 --> 05:35:34,819
Oh, okay, that's fine.

3705
05:35:35,540 --> 05:35:40,200
All right, I need sci-fi corridor one and two.

3706
05:35:43,529 --> 05:35:45,700
Let me save this.

3707
05:35:46,259 --> 05:35:52,810
I still need one more person.

3708
05:35:54,900 --> 05:35:56,099
What about one of the janitors?

3709
05:35:56,099 --> 05:35:57,619
I'm just gonna make one of the janitors an extra.

3710
05:35:58,340 --> 05:35:59,619
Well, there's a lot of people here.

3711
05:36:02,200 --> 05:36:02,680
That's it.

3712
05:36:03,319 --> 05:36:04,759
Now we need the sets.

3713
05:36:05,479 --> 05:36:06,680
Sci-fi corridor one and two.

3714
05:36:12,220 --> 05:36:14,939
Sci-fi corridor one and two.

3715
05:36:15,659 --> 05:36:22,900
That it?

3716
05:36:23,860 --> 05:36:24,819
I think it's ready to go.

3717
05:36:26,090 --> 05:36:28,409
Suburban living room one and alien world.

3718
05:36:29,209 --> 05:36:34,889
What happens in alien world?

3719
05:36:41,830 --> 05:36:42,310
There it is.

3720
05:36:46,040 --> 05:36:47,319
Spartan torture?

3721
05:36:49,619 --> 05:36:50,419
What is that for?

3722
05:36:56,180 --> 05:36:56,659
What else?

3723
05:36:59,060 --> 05:37:00,419
Suburban street.

3724
05:37:00,419 --> 05:37:02,419
Oh man, am I gonna have enough room for this shit?

3725
05:37:03,220 --> 05:37:03,939
I might not.

3726
05:37:04,900 --> 05:37:11,959
This is, this is huge.

3727
05:37:14,419 --> 05:37:15,860
I'm gonna have to move some stuff around.

3728
05:37:16,419 --> 05:37:16,900
I got it.

3729
05:37:18,580 --> 05:37:19,060
And then...

3730
05:37:20,099 --> 05:37:21,060
That it?

3731
05:37:22,020 --> 05:37:22,500
Here we go.

3732
05:37:26,759 --> 05:37:29,290
It's time to shoot it.

3733
05:37:29,849 --> 05:37:33,900
What's wrong?

3734
05:37:33,900 --> 05:37:34,939
You don't, you don't feel good?

3735
05:37:35,900 --> 05:37:37,020
Jax, you don't feel good, Jax?

3736
05:37:40,599 --> 05:37:41,400
Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean?

3737
05:37:41,400 --> 05:37:41,959
Wait, wait?

3738
05:37:51,580 --> 05:37:52,700
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait?

3739
05:37:53,340 --> 05:37:55,080
Get stunt doubles?

3740
05:37:55,639 --> 05:37:57,000
It says they're gonna do their own stunts.

3741
05:38:00,069 --> 05:38:01,270
Oh, you're talking about the music.

3742
05:38:04,869 --> 05:38:06,549
That's what you're wearing you want me to wait for.

3743
05:38:06,549 --> 05:38:06,869
I see.

3744
05:38:07,509 --> 05:38:10,169
I'm gonna save it.

3745
05:38:10,169 --> 05:38:10,729
Let's shoot it.

3746
05:38:17,459 --> 05:38:17,939
Here we go.

3747
05:38:35,669 --> 05:38:36,229
And...

3748
05:38:36,790 --> 05:38:38,259
It's one star.

3749
05:38:45,270 --> 05:38:45,750
Is it done?

3750
05:38:48,310 --> 05:38:49,669
I got instant filming here, man.

3751
05:38:51,909 --> 05:38:57,610
I actually think it's loading it up yet.

3752
05:39:00,939 --> 05:39:01,180
Okay.

3753
05:39:01,819 --> 05:39:04,709
Post production.

3754
05:39:04,709 --> 05:39:06,310
This is KNBS.

3755
05:39:06,310 --> 05:39:11,959
I'm Kristen, the girl who puts the womb in woman.

3756
05:39:11,959 --> 05:39:13,479
Post production.

3757
05:39:13,479 --> 05:39:23,819
I need to make sure I can do this.

3758
05:39:23,819 --> 05:39:24,939
I'm gonna have to restart the game.

3759
05:39:24,939 --> 05:39:26,619
So let me just see what happens when I do this.

3760
05:39:27,259 --> 05:39:32,549
I need to be able to record dialogue.

3761
05:39:36,819 --> 05:39:37,459
Is there...

3762
05:39:37,459 --> 05:39:38,099
Can I not?

3763
05:39:38,740 --> 05:39:41,509
Wasn't there something weird I had to do last time for this?

3764
05:39:47,909 --> 05:39:48,310
Hello.

3765
05:39:49,400 --> 05:39:49,880
Testing.

3766
05:39:50,439 --> 05:39:58,540
Testing.

3767
05:39:58,540 --> 05:40:00,840
It works.

3768
05:40:00,840 --> 05:40:01,799
It's really low though.

3769
05:40:02,439 --> 05:40:13,130
How do I get rid of this?

3770
05:40:13,130 --> 05:40:18,869
Oh, there we go.

3771
05:40:18,869 --> 05:40:21,189
So we are gonna change the title here.

3772
05:40:21,189 --> 05:40:22,630
This is the, this is the big movie.

3773
05:40:23,270 --> 05:40:35,750
Crap.

3774
05:40:35,750 --> 05:40:38,119
Why does it look like this?

3775
05:40:38,119 --> 05:40:53,340
Yeah, this looks like wicked frosty.

3776
05:40:53,340 --> 05:40:58,759
All right.

3777
05:40:58,759 --> 05:41:04,700
First of all, it's not going to be acid bass.

3778
05:41:04,700 --> 05:41:12,150
Following motion picture E3 presentation.

3779
05:41:12,150 --> 05:41:14,709
E presents liquidated production.

3780
05:41:14,709 --> 05:41:18,729
E3 presentation.

3781
05:41:18,729 --> 05:41:18,970
Okay.

3782
05:41:18,970 --> 05:41:20,810
We need applause.

3783
05:41:20,810 --> 05:41:24,680
Let's get the music track on here.

3784
05:41:24,680 --> 05:41:33,770
We need orchestral.

3785
05:41:33,770 --> 05:41:34,889
This might be good.

3786
05:41:34,889 --> 05:41:59,939
All right.

3787
05:41:59,939 --> 05:42:02,659
Well, I'm going to turn off like the mumbling.

3788
05:42:12,279 --> 05:42:14,599
I don't like it.

3789
05:42:14,599 --> 05:42:15,400
Alleyway groove.

3790
05:42:22,790 --> 05:42:23,509
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3791
05:42:23,509 --> 05:42:24,549
Trim before adding the sound.

3792
05:42:24,549 --> 05:42:24,709
Okay.

3793
05:42:24,709 --> 05:42:26,310
So now this is fine.

3794
05:42:29,259 --> 05:42:42,939
I'll put the, I'll do the dialogue on this one.

3795
05:42:42,939 --> 05:42:45,419
Because I have to figure out how long I'm going to talk here.

3796
05:42:45,979 --> 05:42:56,310
Hello and welcome to OhMyGod24's 24th E3.

3797
05:42:56,310 --> 05:43:00,630
As you know that our OhMyGod starts with all of our initials.

3798
05:43:02,340 --> 05:43:07,459
Oswald, Manny, and Greg started this company back, you know, in 19...

3799
05:43:12,299 --> 05:43:13,659
Wait a minute.

3800
05:43:13,659 --> 05:43:14,220
Wait a minute.

3801
05:43:14,220 --> 05:43:14,779
Wait a minute.

3802
05:43:16,220 --> 05:43:16,619
That's...

3803
05:43:17,659 --> 05:43:18,220
That was...

3804
05:43:28,740 --> 05:43:33,060
It's the same fucking lady kissing herself.

3805
05:43:34,540 --> 05:43:38,139
It's the same lady, like, four times.

3806
05:43:48,439 --> 05:43:49,479
Who runs all this...

3807
05:43:57,669 --> 05:43:57,990
How?

3808
05:44:16,259 --> 05:44:18,020
This goes off of way too long, too.

3809
05:44:19,509 --> 05:44:19,830
All right.

3810
05:44:19,830 --> 05:44:20,549
Let me edit this.

3811
05:44:27,099 --> 05:44:29,369
So the CPR goes on.

3812
05:44:29,369 --> 05:44:31,610
I know the CPR is going on for way too long.

3813
05:44:31,610 --> 05:44:35,000
Comes over.

3814
05:44:35,000 --> 05:44:35,639
Wait, wait, wait.

3815
05:44:35,639 --> 05:44:36,200
Get over here.

3816
05:44:40,139 --> 05:44:42,380
The CPR, first of all, needs to be in a different place.

3817
05:44:47,610 --> 05:44:48,729
This is definitely the opener.

3818
05:44:56,900 --> 05:44:57,220
Okay.

3819
05:44:59,110 --> 05:45:00,630
Let's say this is fine.

3820
05:45:00,630 --> 05:45:02,630
I'll do a little bit of a voiceover on this.

3821
05:45:06,979 --> 05:45:08,020
We'll cut it here.

3822
05:45:09,189 --> 05:45:09,830
Delete this.

3823
05:45:13,400 --> 05:45:14,520
My fucking head hurts.

3824
05:45:16,229 --> 05:45:17,990
And then this part, this is the one here.

3825
05:45:17,990 --> 05:45:19,430
I want to cut trim here.

3826
05:45:19,430 --> 05:45:20,389
Wait, let's just make sure.

3827
05:45:21,189 --> 05:45:28,580
Yeah, that looks good.

3828
05:45:35,610 --> 05:45:41,220
Yeah.

3829
05:45:41,220 --> 05:45:42,020
All right.

3830
05:45:42,020 --> 05:45:48,459
We'll stop it there.

3831
05:45:49,619 --> 05:45:49,860
Right...

3832
05:45:50,740 --> 05:45:51,540
Like right here.

3833
05:45:59,959 --> 05:46:01,639
The person kissing themself.

3834
05:46:02,860 --> 05:46:03,659
What the hell is this?

3835
05:46:06,150 --> 05:46:06,549
Wait, wait.

3836
05:46:06,549 --> 05:46:07,110
Why is it...

3837
05:46:07,110 --> 05:46:08,069
I thought it was a person.

3838
05:46:08,069 --> 05:46:09,189
Is it another alien?

3839
05:46:09,189 --> 05:46:09,990
They're just playing.

3840
05:46:29,900 --> 05:46:30,220
Okay.

3841
05:46:37,500 --> 05:46:39,580
That happens way too fast.

3842
05:46:44,090 --> 05:46:44,650
Where are the...

3843
05:46:44,650 --> 05:46:45,930
What's wrong with the tires?

3844
05:46:47,590 --> 05:46:48,310
I need to go get...

3845
05:46:48,869 --> 05:46:52,709
I need to go get this.

3846
05:46:52,709 --> 05:46:53,750
I know that one of these clips...

3847
05:46:56,060 --> 05:46:56,619
This one here.

3848
05:47:13,029 --> 05:47:13,750
This...

3849
05:47:13,750 --> 05:47:25,029
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3850
05:47:25,029 --> 05:47:29,479
Back up over here.

3851
05:47:29,479 --> 05:47:31,000
This dance shit.

3852
05:47:31,000 --> 05:47:47,130
I don't need to trim that here

3853
05:47:47,130 --> 05:47:57,939
because I just want the part where he's driving forward.

3854
05:47:57,939 --> 05:47:59,220
Maybe even a little less.

3855
05:47:59,220 --> 05:48:02,090
Like right here.

3856
05:48:02,090 --> 05:48:02,889
One more notch.

3857
05:48:02,889 --> 05:48:03,930
One more knot right here.

3858
05:48:03,930 --> 05:48:14,060
And then right there.

3859
05:48:14,060 --> 05:48:14,779
Forward.

3860
05:48:14,779 --> 05:48:25,029
So this is the only one that I want to keep.

3861
05:48:25,029 --> 05:48:29,750
Now the question is, should this appear before he runs across the stage?

3862
05:48:29,750 --> 05:48:31,990
Let's take a look.

3863
05:48:44,500 --> 05:48:54,630
We gotta add the explosion in.

3864
05:48:54,630 --> 05:49:08,009
Let's try it over here.

3865
05:49:08,009 --> 05:49:10,650
Yeah, I gotta move the living room as well.

3866
05:49:10,650 --> 05:49:19,750
Let's check this.

3867
05:49:33,779 --> 05:49:45,580
I'm still gonna have an explosion there too.

3868
05:49:45,580 --> 05:49:49,029
I'm gonna put an explosion here, like two of them here.

3869
05:49:49,029 --> 05:49:49,750
Sounds.

3870
05:49:49,750 --> 05:50:01,419
Come on, pull it.

3871
05:50:01,419 --> 05:50:02,599
How does this look?

3872
05:50:25,479 --> 05:50:26,439
All right, that's good.

3873
05:50:31,099 --> 05:50:41,340
Okay, hold on.

3874
05:50:41,340 --> 05:50:41,979
Pull this back.

3875
05:50:46,619 --> 05:50:47,819
Boom, boom, boom.

3876
05:50:47,819 --> 05:51:03,130
The fucking part with the horse and the trash everywhere.

3877
05:51:03,130 --> 05:51:08,619
All right, that has to be explosion, or it sounds like that.

3878
05:51:08,619 --> 05:51:10,540
That actually kind of works pretty well.

3879
05:51:10,540 --> 05:51:12,139
That works pretty well.

3880
05:51:25,209 --> 05:51:27,369
These are all out of order completely.

3881
05:51:27,369 --> 05:51:28,330
I gotta fix these.

3882
05:51:45,779 --> 05:51:49,509
Here's the end.

3883
05:51:50,229 --> 05:51:53,639
So we're gonna start with this.

3884
05:51:54,360 --> 05:51:59,349
Put this over here.

3885
05:51:59,349 --> 05:52:01,590
Because this is like the intro to the second game.

3886
05:52:02,229 --> 05:52:08,069
This is like the knot in the lady.

3887
05:52:08,069 --> 05:52:08,790
She's everywhere.

3888
05:52:13,750 --> 05:52:17,750
And then we gotta get the clowns.

3889
05:52:22,779 --> 05:52:23,659
The car squeeze.

3890
05:52:26,840 --> 05:52:29,000
I don't know what happens here because there's just extras.

3891
05:52:34,099 --> 05:52:35,939
It's gonna be four or five clowns and then all extras.

3892
05:52:50,659 --> 05:52:53,540
They all get in again in different clothes.

3893
05:52:57,779 --> 05:52:59,060
That person got in twice.

3894
05:52:59,700 --> 05:53:06,279
It's just less clothes.

3895
05:53:08,500 --> 05:53:10,659
You just keep removing clothes.

3896
05:53:31,990 --> 05:53:32,709
God damn it.

3897
05:53:33,590 --> 05:53:36,200
Come over here.

3898
05:53:36,840 --> 05:53:42,819
Are they even in the right car?

3899
05:53:48,340 --> 05:53:49,060
Why is this?

3900
05:53:49,060 --> 05:53:50,900
This clip doesn't match.

3901
05:53:50,900 --> 05:53:51,540
It does not.

3902
05:53:51,540 --> 05:53:52,340
I have to delete this.

3903
05:54:00,250 --> 05:54:01,529
I don't think it goes anywhere.

3904
05:54:01,529 --> 05:54:12,680
No, that's bad.

3905
05:54:12,680 --> 05:54:13,240
This goes first.

3906
05:54:13,240 --> 05:54:13,799
This goes first.

3907
05:54:14,520 --> 05:54:22,340
Clearly, clearly only one old grandma in that car.

3908
05:54:31,849 --> 05:54:33,290
Right here.

3909
05:54:39,659 --> 05:54:41,659
It shows the constant conflict.

3910
05:54:41,659 --> 05:54:42,459
That, you know, you're right.

3911
05:54:43,560 --> 05:54:50,380
It does show that.

3912
05:54:50,380 --> 05:54:51,900
But I need, where's that other one?

3913
05:54:52,630 --> 05:54:53,430
I'll write this too.

3914
05:54:53,430 --> 05:54:56,889
This right here, right here.

3915
05:54:56,889 --> 05:54:57,770
We start with this.

3916
05:55:05,060 --> 05:55:08,779
And then it comes through here with some music.

3917
05:55:11,259 --> 05:55:12,619
Maybe a little bit shorter than that.

3918
05:55:12,619 --> 05:55:13,659
Doesn't need to be that long.

3919
05:55:14,299 --> 05:55:15,580
No in-game footage.

3920
05:55:15,580 --> 05:55:17,099
They both are gonna say it.

3921
05:55:17,099 --> 05:55:19,450
We'll go with like here.

3922
05:55:23,419 --> 05:55:29,669
All right, that's fine.

3923
05:55:29,669 --> 05:55:30,630
Everybody gets in the car.

3924
05:55:39,959 --> 05:55:41,479
I hate how long this is.

3925
05:55:53,509 --> 05:55:55,990
While they all get in, they peel out.

3926
05:55:55,990 --> 05:56:04,409
Let's see how this transitions together.

3927
05:56:04,409 --> 05:56:06,409
Intense music flying around through the city.

3928
05:56:08,439 --> 05:56:10,919
I'm gonna put like loud sounds.

3929
05:56:11,639 --> 05:56:16,860
Here's that car traffic one where there's a couple of accidents.

3930
05:56:16,860 --> 05:56:17,900
Him stepping on the brake.

3931
05:56:18,459 --> 05:56:22,540
No, no, no, no.

3932
05:56:22,540 --> 05:56:23,099
Get over here.

3933
05:56:23,099 --> 05:56:34,680
Let's try this.

3934
05:56:36,819 --> 05:56:38,340
Clown car battle royale.

3935
05:56:51,430 --> 05:56:52,790
Wrong one, wrong one, wrong one.

3936
05:56:52,790 --> 05:56:53,750
It's gotta be this way.

3937
05:56:53,750 --> 05:56:59,159
Okay.

3938
05:57:08,569 --> 05:57:09,610
That's so delayed.

3939
05:57:09,610 --> 05:57:10,569
But where does he stop?

3940
05:57:10,569 --> 05:57:11,290
No, no, no, no, no.

3941
05:57:11,290 --> 05:57:25,720
Wait.

3942
05:57:25,720 --> 05:57:40,779
He should stop peeling out here.

3943
05:57:40,779 --> 05:57:42,139
But he's no, he's still going.

3944
05:57:51,299 --> 05:57:54,020
No, he's gotta smash the brake.

3945
05:57:54,020 --> 05:57:56,919
We did this last time.

3946
05:57:56,919 --> 05:57:59,000
This like same scenario played out.

3947
05:57:59,000 --> 05:58:18,759
Hold on, let me cut this right here.

3948
05:58:18,759 --> 05:58:25,639
I gotta get this right because I can't go back on this.

3949
05:58:25,639 --> 05:58:26,950
Right there.

3950
05:58:26,950 --> 05:58:27,830
Looks good.

3951
05:58:27,830 --> 05:58:29,139
Okay.

3952
05:58:29,139 --> 05:58:51,610
I'm not gonna get rid of that yet because if it's wrong,

3953
05:58:51,610 --> 05:58:52,810
it's gotta be faster than that.

3954
05:58:52,810 --> 05:58:55,689
It's gotta be like slam, bang.

3955
05:58:55,689 --> 05:59:09,240
I'm gonna put clapping and audience applause and stuff through this.

3956
05:59:20,250 --> 05:59:20,970
It's a car.

3957
05:59:20,970 --> 05:59:22,009
The car was red.

3958
05:59:25,110 --> 05:59:25,909
Wait, what?

3959
05:59:25,909 --> 05:59:31,130
This is good.

3960
05:59:31,130 --> 05:59:33,209
I can add, I can, I'm gonna add sounds later.

3961
05:59:33,209 --> 05:59:39,979
Don't worry.

3962
05:59:39,979 --> 05:59:40,299
Wait.

3963
05:59:57,590 --> 05:59:58,709
This is one of the other clowns.

3964
05:59:58,709 --> 06:00:00,150
It's not even the same clown.

3965
06:00:00,150 --> 06:00:08,939
I don't want this in.

3966
06:00:11,560 --> 06:00:13,880
I don't think that that deserves to be in.

3967
06:00:13,880 --> 06:00:30,200
All right, let's, let's start.

3968
06:00:30,200 --> 06:00:38,540
I think that's good for cutting.

3969
06:00:38,540 --> 06:00:40,700
Yeah, this is, this is post credits.

3970
06:00:40,700 --> 06:00:47,880
Can I not put it there?

3971
06:00:47,880 --> 06:00:50,200
Come on, I can't put that in front of the credits.

3972
06:00:57,159 --> 06:00:58,200
All right, well, here we go.

3973
06:00:58,200 --> 06:01:01,099
I think it's, I think this is good.

3974
06:01:09,240 --> 06:01:12,020
Let's see if I can start recording here.

3975
06:01:23,319 --> 06:01:26,380
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage,

3976
06:01:26,380 --> 06:01:45,130
President and CEO of Oh My God Entertainment, Steve Spruns.

3977
06:01:45,130 --> 06:01:45,849
I was supposed to say it worked.

3978
06:01:45,849 --> 06:02:01,220
Welcome to the stage, President and CEO of Oh My God Entertainment, Steve Spruns.

3979
06:02:01,220 --> 06:02:03,459
What mic is it pulling from is what I want to know.

3980
06:02:07,380 --> 06:02:09,060
I gotta have more enthusiasm than that.

3981
06:02:09,060 --> 06:02:19,220
It's not pulling from the webcam.

3982
06:02:19,220 --> 06:02:20,099
No, I don't think so.

3983
06:02:24,810 --> 06:02:27,130
Ladies and gentlemen, if you could please rise.

3984
06:02:28,310 --> 06:02:36,650
And welcome our President and CEO of Oh My God Entertainment, Greg Strauns.

3985
06:02:36,650 --> 06:02:46,939
Let's rise.

3986
06:02:46,939 --> 06:03:06,580
And welcome our President and CEO of Oh My God Entertainment, Greg Strauns.

3987
06:03:06,580 --> 06:03:09,180
What mic is this even picking up?

3988
06:03:09,180 --> 06:03:10,459
Yeah, it's like I'm in another room.

3989
06:03:10,459 --> 06:03:10,860
Where is it?

3990
06:03:10,860 --> 06:03:13,240
Hold on, let me test something.

3991
06:03:13,240 --> 06:03:13,799
Find the mic.

3992
06:03:23,750 --> 06:03:24,549
Let's find it.

3993
06:03:24,549 --> 06:03:41,369
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

3994
06:03:41,369 --> 06:03:49,139
Why is it having so much trouble with my mic?

3995
06:03:49,139 --> 06:03:55,720
It's this mic here.

3996
06:03:55,720 --> 06:03:57,560
No, that's not the dialogue.

3997
06:03:57,560 --> 06:04:05,159
I have to get like really close.

3998
06:04:05,159 --> 06:04:12,279
All right, let me get applause here.

3999
06:04:12,279 --> 06:04:16,810
Is there any, is it big applause?

4000
06:04:16,810 --> 06:04:30,819
I think this is just a shitty one.

4001
06:04:30,819 --> 06:04:42,810
I was going to put like a bunch of yawns in.

4002
06:04:42,810 --> 06:04:45,049
Ladies and gentlemen, if you could please rise.

4003
06:04:45,689 --> 06:04:52,810
And welcome our President and CEO of Oh My God Entertainment,

4004
06:04:55,110 --> 06:04:59,130
Strauns.

4005
06:04:59,130 --> 06:04:59,689
Strauns.

4006
06:05:06,619 --> 06:05:08,220
How about Bad Bad Bud?

4007
06:05:12,860 --> 06:05:19,779
President and CEO of Oh My God Entertainment, Greg Strauns.

4008
06:05:27,500 --> 06:05:32,380
I'm just gonna have fucking yawns everywhere.

4009
06:05:32,380 --> 06:05:34,060
This is so douchey.

4010
06:05:35,659 --> 06:05:36,779
Hold on, hold on.

4011
06:05:36,779 --> 06:05:42,040
Wait.

4012
06:05:42,040 --> 06:05:43,000
God Entertainment.

4013
06:05:44,680 --> 06:05:45,180
Greg.

4014
06:06:03,830 --> 06:06:04,330
Boo.

4015
06:06:05,189 --> 06:06:07,590
That doesn't even have to be a boo.

4016
06:06:07,590 --> 06:06:08,790
Oh My God.

4017
06:06:09,180 --> 06:06:11,580
I'm gonna go a little, let's start it a little bit more back here.

4018
06:06:14,259 --> 06:06:15,380
Ladies and gentlemen, if you could.

4019
06:06:22,650 --> 06:06:24,970
Ladies and gentlemen, if you could please rise.

4020
06:06:26,090 --> 06:06:34,069
And welcome our President and CEO of Oh My God Entertainment, Greg Strauns.

4021
06:06:36,119 --> 06:06:38,919
All right, they're like da-do da-do da-do da-do.

4022
06:06:42,330 --> 06:06:42,830
Boo.

4023
06:06:43,849 --> 06:06:50,040
God Entertainment.

4024
06:06:50,840 --> 06:06:53,110
Strauns.

4025
06:06:57,849 --> 06:06:58,349
Boo.

4026
06:07:01,750 --> 06:07:02,229
Right there.

4027
06:07:05,099 --> 06:07:06,779
I can't get rid of booing mail.

4028
06:07:09,509 --> 06:07:11,750
How many times are you gonna hear Greg Strauns?

4029
06:07:12,549 --> 06:07:14,069
Greg Strauns.

4030
06:07:14,790 --> 06:07:16,470
Greg Strauns.

4031
06:07:16,470 --> 06:07:17,509
Greg Strauns.

4032
06:07:18,069 --> 06:07:18,569
Boo.

4033
06:07:35,990 --> 06:07:39,270
Greg Strauns.

4034
06:07:39,270 --> 06:07:39,770
Boo.

4035
06:07:48,009 --> 06:07:48,509
Boo.

4036
06:07:51,029 --> 06:07:53,909
This is a lot of claps.

4037
06:07:56,069 --> 06:07:57,750
All right, I'll settle down everybody.

4038
06:07:58,650 --> 06:08:00,409
Okay, so we hear it.

4039
06:08:01,209 --> 06:08:03,290
I'm gonna shut, how do we shut this fucking music off?

4040
06:08:22,340 --> 06:08:24,020
I'm gonna get the laugh out of there.

4041
06:08:25,139 --> 06:08:30,729
All right, found it.

4042
06:08:38,970 --> 06:08:44,319
Okay.

4043
06:08:50,470 --> 06:08:52,470
Welcome everybody to E3.

4044
06:08:53,349 --> 06:08:57,830
I'm here to present to you two of our upcoming releases that I think you'll love.

4045
06:08:59,159 --> 06:09:06,520
And first of all, let me just be the first to say that E3, we're here.

4046
06:09:06,520 --> 06:09:08,599
Oh my God, that was not good.

4047
06:09:09,240 --> 06:09:14,580
Welcome everybody to E3.

4048
06:09:15,380 --> 06:09:19,959
I'm here to present to you two of our upcoming releases that I think you'll love.

4049
06:09:21,349 --> 06:09:28,630
And first of all, let me just be the first to say that E3, we're here.

4050
06:09:28,630 --> 06:09:35,830
Oh my God.

4051
06:09:35,830 --> 06:09:36,549
Okay, hold on.

4052
06:09:37,349 --> 06:09:38,229
I gotta write this out.

4053
06:09:40,139 --> 06:09:42,220
I gotta write this out because it's gonna be elaborate.

4054
06:09:49,580 --> 06:09:51,099
Okay, thank you.

4055
06:09:51,099 --> 06:09:52,139
Hey, hey, you in the back.

4056
06:09:52,139 --> 06:09:53,659
Hey, that's who I'm talking about.

4057
06:09:54,139 --> 06:09:55,580
Welcome to E3 everybody.

4058
06:09:56,220 --> 06:09:57,659
We're so happy to be here.

4059
06:09:57,659 --> 06:10:03,020
We are beyond excited to show you two new releases upcoming in our catalog of

4060
06:10:03,020 --> 06:10:04,860
Oh My God Entertainment Games.

4061
06:10:04,860 --> 06:10:09,020
That's Osmond, that's Michael, and that's Gary.

4062
06:10:09,020 --> 06:10:26,540
The three of us are who I'm talking about.

4063
06:10:26,540 --> 06:10:27,979
Welcome to E3 everybody.

4064
06:10:28,619 --> 06:10:30,060
We're so happy to be here.

4065
06:10:30,060 --> 06:10:33,979
We are beyond excited to show you two new releases

4066
06:10:33,979 --> 06:10:37,259
upcoming in our catalog of Oh My God Entertainment Games.

4067
06:10:37,259 --> 06:10:41,419
That's Osmond, that's Michael, and that's Gary.

4068
06:10:41,419 --> 06:10:43,020
Yeah, why is it so quiet?

4069
06:10:43,020 --> 06:10:44,779
I don't understand why it's so quiet.

4070
06:10:57,799 --> 06:10:58,680
Hold on, let me see.

4071
06:10:59,479 --> 06:11:01,060
I'm gonna save this for a second.

4072
06:11:05,819 --> 06:11:08,060
Maybe I have to go into like the sound options?

4073
06:11:08,060 --> 06:11:09,340
No, I don't think nothing was there.

4074
06:11:10,869 --> 06:11:12,950
It's probably a tech error happens at every E3.

4075
06:11:17,110 --> 06:11:19,430
I really would love to find a way to cut this.

4076
06:11:20,310 --> 06:11:29,750
Yeah, right clicking doesn't do anything.

4077
06:11:29,750 --> 06:11:30,950
Double clicking doesn't do anything.

4078
06:11:40,009 --> 06:11:42,250
Ladies and gentlemen, if you could please rise.

4079
06:11:43,450 --> 06:11:48,330
And welcome our president and CEO of Oh My God Entertainment.

4080
06:11:50,650 --> 06:11:52,729
Raise the volume of the game in the windows mixer

4081
06:11:52,729 --> 06:11:55,049
and lower the music volume from the in-game slider.

4082
06:11:56,090 --> 06:11:56,810
Yeah, let me see.

4083
06:11:57,529 --> 06:11:58,919
That's not a bad idea.

4084
06:12:00,139 --> 06:12:01,419
That's a really good idea actually.

4085
06:12:02,810 --> 06:12:03,849
Let me save it, hold tight.

4086
06:12:05,619 --> 06:12:07,220
So, hold on.

4087
06:12:07,220 --> 06:12:12,490
Let me just get in here.

4088
06:12:13,610 --> 06:12:16,810
Let me mute this for a second.

4089
06:12:17,450 --> 06:12:21,130
I think what I actually have to do is go like actually into the game,

4090
06:12:21,130 --> 06:12:22,650
like the mixer of the game.

4091
06:12:22,650 --> 06:12:23,529
Yeah, like you're saying.

4092
06:12:24,250 --> 06:12:27,099
Let's see if that does anything.

4093
06:12:27,099 --> 06:12:32,599
Did that fix?

4094
06:12:33,319 --> 06:12:34,619
Can you see?

4095
06:12:35,340 --> 06:12:38,520
I wonder if that does anything.

4096
06:12:39,080 --> 06:12:40,439
Whoa, that's loud.

4097
06:12:41,319 --> 06:12:46,180
Ladies and gentlemen, if you could please rise.

4098
06:12:46,819 --> 06:12:48,180
It's really loud for me now.

4099
06:12:49,700 --> 06:12:50,419
Hold on.

4100
06:12:50,419 --> 06:12:59,529
This is going to be really loud for me,

4101
06:12:59,529 --> 06:13:00,889
but it should be okay for you guys.

4102
06:13:00,889 --> 06:13:01,290
Let's see.

4103
06:13:02,330 --> 06:13:07,700
Tell me if this changes anything.

4104
06:13:16,759 --> 06:13:19,000
And welcome our president and CEO

4105
06:13:19,959 --> 06:13:21,880

4106
06:13:21,880 --> 06:13:22,360
Here we go.

4107
06:13:23,319 --> 06:13:24,759
Greg Strauss.

4108
06:13:26,360 --> 06:13:28,119
Oh, but that's fucking loud as hell.

4109
06:13:38,569 --> 06:13:39,369
Thank you.

4110
06:13:39,369 --> 06:13:40,409
Hey, hey, you in the back.

4111
06:13:40,409 --> 06:13:42,409
Hey, that's who I'm talking about.

4112
06:13:42,409 --> 06:13:43,849
Welcome to E3 everybody.

4113
06:13:44,490 --> 06:13:45,930
We're so happy to be here.

4114
06:13:45,930 --> 06:13:49,849
We are beyond excited to show you two new releases

4115
06:13:49,849 --> 06:13:53,130
upcoming in our catalog of Oh My God Entertainment games.

4116
06:13:53,130 --> 06:13:54,729
That's Osmond.

4117
06:13:54,729 --> 06:13:55,930
That's Michael.

4118
06:13:55,930 --> 06:13:58,169
And that's Gary, the three of us.

4119
06:14:02,500 --> 06:14:05,139
All right, so how the fuck do I edit audio?

4120
06:14:21,080 --> 06:14:24,119
Yeah, I can't like drag and like resize anything.

4121
06:14:25,000 --> 06:14:28,540
I wonder if, hold on, can I do this?

4122
06:14:28,540 --> 06:14:29,500
Can I just like break it?

4123
06:14:30,790 --> 06:14:31,509
See if I do this.

4124
06:14:42,950 --> 06:14:44,470
Who's got the fucking phone on?

4125
06:14:48,759 --> 06:14:50,599
Yeah, I can't like drag the audio.

4126
06:14:51,240 --> 06:14:52,360
It just drags the whole thing.

4127
06:14:54,939 --> 06:14:56,060
Why?

4128
06:14:56,060 --> 06:15:00,330
I don't remember that being a problem.

4129
06:15:00,330 --> 06:15:04,599
Now the scissors cut the clip.

4130
06:15:07,639 --> 06:15:11,240
Audio options is just toggling on and off sound effects.

4131
06:15:13,209 --> 06:15:13,770
What the hell?

4132
06:15:14,659 --> 06:15:15,619
I think there's a way.

4133
06:15:16,340 --> 06:15:18,840
This guy, I think there's like a...

4134
06:15:21,189 --> 06:15:22,630
I don't know.

4135
06:15:22,630 --> 06:15:32,139
The game wiki says you can not edit the length.

4136
06:15:32,139 --> 06:15:38,200
I mean, I can just, you can cancel it out with something else.

4137
06:15:38,759 --> 06:15:43,909
I wish then I could just move it back, but no.

4138
06:15:45,110 --> 06:15:50,630
Oh well.

4139
06:15:51,590 --> 06:15:53,990
Just find the shortest music clip to cancel it out.

4140
06:15:56,569 --> 06:15:56,810
All right.

4141
06:16:00,919 --> 06:16:11,430
Because I have to record over this.

4142
06:16:13,110 --> 06:16:13,909
The three of us.

4143
06:16:15,430 --> 06:16:18,200
Okay, let's try this.

4144
06:16:21,990 --> 06:16:23,590
That's Osmond.

4145
06:16:23,590 --> 06:16:24,790
That's Michael.

4146
06:16:24,790 --> 06:16:26,150
And that's Gary.

4147
06:16:26,150 --> 06:16:27,430
The three of us.

4148
06:16:27,430 --> 06:16:28,229
We created this.

4149
06:16:28,869 --> 06:16:29,270
We're...

4150
06:16:29,270 --> 06:16:29,509
Fuck.

4151
06:16:42,139 --> 06:16:43,020
It's right here.

4152
06:16:43,020 --> 06:16:45,020
The three of us are just so...

4153
06:16:45,939 --> 06:16:47,139
That's Gary.

4154
06:16:47,139 --> 06:16:52,340
The three of us are so excited and so ready to present to you our new...

4155
06:16:53,619 --> 06:16:53,939
Cat.

4156
06:16:55,979 --> 06:16:57,099
Can you turn the phone off?

4157
06:16:58,619 --> 06:17:01,659
You come to an E-Teap Day E3 conference and you don't turn your cell phone off?

4158
06:17:03,669 --> 06:17:04,950
Yeah, why don't you come up here then?

4159
06:17:05,770 --> 06:17:06,009
Yeah.

4160
06:17:06,729 --> 06:17:09,189
That's why don't you get up here and start talking to me.

4161
06:17:10,970 --> 06:17:12,009
This clip is too long.

4162
06:17:17,779 --> 06:17:20,340
Excited and so ready to present to you our new...

4163
06:17:22,520 --> 06:17:26,659

4165
06:17:31,799 --> 06:17:37,340
Yeah, why don't you turn the phone off?

4166
06:17:37,340 --> 06:17:38,380
Was it one to a hundred?

4167
06:17:40,279 --> 06:17:43,240
You come to an E-Teap Day E3 conference and you don't turn your cell phone off?

4168
06:17:45,340 --> 06:17:46,619
Yeah, why don't you come up here then?

4170
06:17:48,680 --> 06:17:50,840
That's why don't you get up here and start talking to me.

4171
06:17:51,990 --> 06:17:53,029
I have to go over this.

4172
06:17:54,549 --> 06:17:55,750
Fuck, another dialogue.

4173
06:17:59,400 --> 06:18:01,080

4177
06:18:13,720 --> 06:18:15,479

4178
06:18:21,049 --> 06:18:24,009

That's why don't you get up here and start talking to me.

4186
06:18:44,729 --> 06:18:46,330
Do you see how much bigger I am than you?

4187
06:18:46,330 --> 06:18:47,130
This clip is too long.

4188
06:18:47,130 --> 06:18:48,009

I want to get rid of this...

4201
06:19:23,500 --> 06:19:24,779
No, I can do better than that.

How do I get the this clip is too long out?

4203

You come to an E3 conference and you don't turn your cell phone off?

06:21:08,520 --> 06:21:09,240
I don't give a shit.

06:21:09,240 --> 06:21:10,279
This clip is too long.

4238
06:21:10,279 --> 06:21:12,840
I don't care if it's broadcasted live.

4239
06:21:12,840 --> 06:21:13,799

4240
06:21:28,119 --> 06:21:29,159

Sorry, I'm sorry.

4256
06:22:12,020 --> 06:22:15,220
Can you come to an E3 conference and you don't turn your cell phone off?

4257
06:22:15,220 --> 06:22:17,380
No, I had it on silent but it didn't work.

4258
06:22:17,380 --> 06:22:18,180
Why don't you come up here then?

4259
06:22:18,900 --> 06:22:19,380
Fuck you.

That's why don't you get up here and start talking to me.

4261
06:22:22,419 --> 06:22:26,180
Yeah, you got a 72% Metacritic score across all your games.

4262
06:22:27,380 --> 06:22:28,180
I will smash you.

4263
06:22:28,180 --> 06:22:29,060
I'm gonna get it, man.

4264
06:22:36,069 --> 06:22:36,470
Sorry, I'm sorry.

4265
06:22:36,470 --> 06:22:39,430
Can you come to an E3 conference and you don't turn your cell phone off?

I had it on silent but it didn't work.

4267
06:22:41,669 --> 06:22:42,709
Yeah, why don't you come up here then?

4268
06:22:43,509 --> 06:22:43,830
Yeah.

06:22:43,830 --> 06:22:44,310
Fuck you.

4270
06:22:44,950 --> 06:22:47,189
Why don't you get up here and start talking to me?

4271
06:22:47,189 --> 06:22:51,029
Yeah, you got a 72% Metacritic score across all your games.

4272
06:22:51,029 --> 06:22:52,630
I don't care if it's broadcasted live.

4273
06:22:52,630 --> 06:22:53,590
I will smash you.

4274
06:22:55,590 --> 06:22:57,590
Okay, hold on.

4275
06:22:57,590 --> 06:22:58,549
Wait a second.

4276
06:23:00,680 --> 06:23:01,880
I can do that better.

4277
06:23:04,229 --> 06:23:04,630
Sorry, I'm sorry.

4278
06:23:04,630 --> 06:23:07,590
Can you come to an E3 conference and you don't turn your cell phone off?

4279
06:23:08,619 --> 06:23:10,540
I gotta be quicker on this one.

4280
06:23:12,500 --> 06:23:16,869
I wish I could grab the right one.

4281
06:23:16,869 --> 06:23:18,150
Yeah, why don't you come up here then?

4282
06:23:23,990 --> 06:23:27,380
Yeah, why don't you get up here and start talking to me?

4283
06:23:28,180 --> 06:23:30,169
This clip is too long.

4284
06:23:31,130 --> 06:23:32,729
Where does it start?

4285
06:23:33,369 --> 06:23:40,439
Why don't you come up here then?

4286
06:23:41,240 --> 06:23:44,650
Yeah, why don't you get up here and start talking to me?

4287
06:23:46,419 --> 06:23:47,459
This clip is too long.

4288
06:23:56,419 --> 06:23:57,060
That's it.

4289
06:23:58,939 --> 06:23:59,979
Record silenced.

4290
06:24:00,700 --> 06:24:03,180
It's not gonna work because they layer on top of each other.

4291
06:24:06,700 --> 06:24:08,299
You get up here and start talking to me.

4292
06:24:09,180 --> 06:24:11,099
This clip is too long.

4293
06:24:11,979 --> 06:24:14,409
I don't give a shit.

4294
06:24:14,409 --> 06:24:14,970
Oh, here we go.

4295
06:24:22,069 --> 06:24:23,189
And start talking to me.

4296
06:24:23,189 --> 06:24:23,990
I don't give a shit.

4297
06:24:26,919 --> 06:24:27,880
This clip is too long.

4298
06:24:27,880 --> 06:24:30,439
I don't care how it's broadcasted live.

4299
06:24:30,439 --> 06:24:31,400
I will smash you.

4300
06:24:37,130 --> 06:24:39,770
I don't care how it's broadcasted live.

4301
06:24:39,770 --> 06:24:40,650
I will smash you.

4302
06:24:43,580 --> 06:24:44,459
Guys, guys.

4303
06:24:45,259 --> 06:24:45,740
Smash you.

4304
06:24:46,299 --> 06:24:52,060
My fucking god.

4305
06:24:52,060 --> 06:24:53,659
This is fucking horrible.

4306
06:24:53,659 --> 06:24:54,220
This is like...

4307
06:24:55,500 --> 06:24:56,860
All right, I gotta get this right first try.

4308
06:24:56,860 --> 06:24:57,180
Here we go.

4309
06:24:59,180 --> 06:25:01,880
Can you turn the phone off?

4310
06:25:01,880 --> 06:25:02,279
Sorry.

4311
06:25:02,840 --> 06:25:03,159
Sorry.

4312
06:25:03,159 --> 06:25:06,119
You come to an E3 conference and you don't turn your cell phone off?

4313
06:25:06,119 --> 06:25:07,080
I thought it was on silent.

4314
06:25:07,080 --> 06:25:07,560
I'm sorry.

4315
06:25:07,560 --> 06:25:08,200
I screwed up.

4316
06:25:08,200 --> 06:25:09,880
Yeah, why don't you come up here then?

4317
06:25:09,880 --> 06:25:11,240
I don't want to go up there.

4318
06:25:11,240 --> 06:25:11,639
No.

4319
06:25:11,639 --> 06:25:13,720
Why don't you get up here and start talking to me?

4320
06:25:13,720 --> 06:25:14,840
Your company sucks anyways.

4321
06:25:14,840 --> 06:25:15,639
I'm only here because I have to.

4322
06:25:15,639 --> 06:25:16,439
This clip is too long.

4323
06:25:16,439 --> 06:25:16,919
I don't give a shit.

4324
06:25:17,639 --> 06:25:20,040
I don't care how it's broadcasted live.

4325
06:25:20,040 --> 06:25:21,400
I will smash you.

4326
06:25:28,970 --> 06:25:29,930
I thought it was on silent.

4327
06:25:29,930 --> 06:25:30,409
I'm sorry.

4328
06:25:30,409 --> 06:25:30,970
I screwed up.

4329
06:25:30,970 --> 06:25:32,169
Yeah, why don't you come up here then?

4330
06:25:32,810 --> 06:25:34,090
I don't want to go up there.

4331
06:25:34,090 --> 06:25:34,330
No.

4332
06:25:34,330 --> 06:25:36,569
Why don't you get up here and start talking to me?

4333
06:25:36,569 --> 06:25:37,689
Your company sucks anyways.

4334
06:25:37,689 --> 06:25:38,250
I'm only here because I have to.

4335
06:25:38,250 --> 06:25:39,130
This clip is too long.

4336
06:25:39,130 --> 06:25:39,770
I don't give a shit.

4337
06:25:40,810 --> 06:25:42,889
I don't care how it's broadcasted live.

4338
06:25:42,889 --> 06:25:44,250
I will smash you.

4339
06:25:45,610 --> 06:25:46,810
What happened to this part?

4340
06:25:54,599 --> 06:25:55,560
Fuck you is better.

4341
06:26:01,619 --> 06:26:03,619
Why don't you get up here and start talking to me?

4342
06:26:05,369 --> 06:26:06,409
This clip is too long.

4343
06:26:12,599 --> 06:26:13,959
Dude, the first one was better.

4344
06:26:15,159 --> 06:26:18,919
I wish I could just fucking trim audio clips.

4345
06:26:23,639 --> 06:26:24,439
I don't give a shit.

4346
06:26:25,080 --> 06:26:26,680
I don't care how it's broadcasted live.

4347
06:26:30,229 --> 06:26:31,110
I will smash you.

4348
06:26:31,750 --> 06:26:36,650
This clip is too long.

4349
06:26:37,529 --> 06:26:38,409
I don't give a shit.

4350
06:26:38,409 --> 06:26:39,209
Here we go.

4351
06:26:39,209 --> 06:26:41,450
I don't care how it's broadcasted live.

4352
06:26:46,009 --> 06:26:46,729
Fuck.

4353
06:26:46,729 --> 06:26:47,369
I don't give a shit.

4354
06:26:47,369 --> 06:26:48,490
This clip is too long.

4355
06:26:48,490 --> 06:26:51,049
I don't care how it's broadcasted live.

4356
06:26:51,049 --> 06:26:52,009
I will smash you.

4357
06:26:54,439 --> 06:26:56,279
There's no waveforms.

4358
06:26:56,279 --> 06:26:57,080
Oh my God.

4359
06:26:57,720 --> 06:27:00,279
I don't care if it's broadcasted live.

4360
06:27:00,279 --> 06:27:01,240
I will smash you.

4361
06:27:02,599 --> 06:27:03,080
Okay.

4362
06:27:03,080 --> 06:27:03,560
That's it.

4363
06:27:03,560 --> 06:27:04,439
I got this.

4364
06:27:04,439 --> 06:27:05,000
I don't know.

4365
06:27:05,000 --> 06:27:05,880
I'm not going to touch this.

4366
06:27:07,099 --> 06:27:07,659
Put cheering.

4367
06:27:07,659 --> 06:27:07,979
You know what?

4368
06:27:07,979 --> 06:27:08,459
I will.

4369
06:27:08,459 --> 06:27:09,580
I'm going to get this.

4370
06:27:12,180 --> 06:27:12,580
All right.

4371
06:27:12,580 --> 06:27:13,299
I want to show you guys.

4372
06:27:13,299 --> 06:27:15,700
So I'm going to show you what the scissors do.

4373
06:27:15,700 --> 06:27:17,939
The scissors split the scene.

4374
06:27:17,939 --> 06:27:19,139
If they don't split the audio.

4375
06:27:19,139 --> 06:27:20,340
We tried it already.

4376
06:27:20,340 --> 06:27:21,220
We tried it already.

4377
06:27:21,220 --> 06:27:21,860
Somebody's rated?

4378
06:27:21,860 --> 06:27:22,659
Who rated?

4379
06:27:22,659 --> 06:27:24,180
We got a rate?

4380
06:27:28,979 --> 06:27:29,540
Oh shit.

4381
06:27:33,459 --> 06:27:34,340
Joel coming in with a rate.

4382
06:27:34,340 --> 06:27:35,139
Hey, thanks Joel.

4383
06:27:36,790 --> 06:27:38,819
Welcome everybody.

4384
06:27:38,819 --> 06:27:46,810
We're currently fumbling our way through the movies for a second time.

4385
06:27:46,810 --> 06:27:48,090
I have all these things recorded.

4386
06:27:48,090 --> 06:27:50,970
I'm trying to painstakingly put this together.

4387
06:27:51,529 --> 06:27:52,810
I hope you had a good stream.

4388
06:27:53,860 --> 06:27:56,740
And stick around if you'd like to see how this plays out.

4389
06:27:56,740 --> 06:27:58,939
But thanks a lot, Joel.

4390
06:27:58,939 --> 06:27:59,900
Welcome everybody.

4391
06:27:59,900 --> 06:28:02,889
Hope you're having a good fucking day.

4392
06:28:02,889 --> 06:28:05,959
This is my YouTuber voice now.

4393
06:28:05,959 --> 06:28:07,639
Can you turn the phone off?

4394
06:28:08,279 --> 06:28:08,599
Okay.

4395
06:28:08,599 --> 06:28:09,479
I'm going to go for it again.

4396
06:28:13,509 --> 06:28:18,819
Michael and that's Gary.

4397
06:28:18,819 --> 06:28:21,779
The three of us are so excited.

4398
06:28:21,779 --> 06:28:23,939
It's so ready to present to you our new...

4399
06:28:26,299 --> 06:28:28,979
Can you turn the phone off?

4400
06:28:28,979 --> 06:28:29,860
I'm sorry.

4401
06:28:29,860 --> 06:28:30,500
My phone's on.

4402
06:28:30,500 --> 06:28:33,540
You come to an E3 conference and you don't turn your cell phone off?

4403
06:28:33,540 --> 06:28:35,779
Look, you got a 68% of Medicare to go to all your games.

4404
06:28:35,779 --> 06:28:36,900
Why don't you come up here then?

4405
06:28:36,900 --> 06:28:37,779
I just said that to you.

4406
06:28:37,779 --> 06:28:38,819
So it doesn't matter.

4407
06:28:38,819 --> 06:28:40,500
Why don't you get up here and start talking.

4408
06:28:40,500 --> 06:28:41,380
I'm going up there.

4409
06:28:41,380 --> 06:28:42,099
I'm going up there.

4410
06:28:42,099 --> 06:28:43,220
Just let go.

4411
06:28:44,259 --> 06:28:45,220
I'm getting up here right now.

4412
06:28:45,220 --> 06:28:47,220
If it's broadcasted live, I will smash you.

4413
06:28:47,220 --> 06:28:48,020
What are you going to say to him?

4414
06:28:54,569 --> 06:29:00,619
I got it.

4415
06:29:00,619 --> 06:29:01,500
Where'd it go?

4416
06:29:01,500 --> 06:29:09,319
Where is it?

4417
06:29:09,319 --> 06:29:12,889
Oh.

4418
06:29:12,889 --> 06:29:13,849
No, I'm going up there.

4419
06:29:13,849 --> 06:29:16,409
I don't care if it's broadcasted live.

4420
06:29:16,409 --> 06:29:17,130
I will smash you.

4421
06:29:20,009 --> 06:29:20,330
Okay.

4422
06:29:21,529 --> 06:29:23,369
Dialogue 14 is here.

4423
06:29:23,930 --> 06:29:29,419
No, let go.

4424
06:29:30,299 --> 06:29:31,340
I'm getting up there right now.

4425
06:29:40,729 --> 06:29:42,409
You get up here and start talking to me.

4426
06:29:43,380 --> 06:29:44,020
Fuck you.

4427
06:29:44,020 --> 06:29:44,580
I'm going up there.

4428
06:29:44,580 --> 06:29:45,060
It's too close.

4429
06:29:45,060 --> 06:29:45,619
I'm going up there.

4430
06:29:45,619 --> 06:29:46,419
Just let go.

4431
06:29:46,419 --> 06:29:48,819
I don't care if it's broadcasted live.

4432
06:29:48,819 --> 06:29:49,860
I will smash you.

4433
06:29:50,580 --> 06:29:51,540
What are you going to say to him?

4434
06:29:54,860 --> 06:29:55,900
Dialogue 12.

4435
06:29:55,900 --> 06:29:56,939
Dialogue 12.

4436
06:30:03,689 --> 06:30:06,729
Oh, I would love to get dialogue 14 out of here.

4437
06:30:06,729 --> 06:30:07,450
Oh, no.

4438
06:30:09,860 --> 06:30:12,740
I would fucking love to be able to get dialogue 14.

4439
06:30:20,540 --> 06:30:21,099
Got it.

4440
06:30:21,099 --> 06:30:22,619
Okay.

4441
06:30:32,500 --> 06:30:33,220
I'm going to give this...

4442
06:30:33,860 --> 06:30:34,500
I'm going to bring in...

4443
06:30:34,500 --> 06:30:35,299
Let's bring in 12.

4444
06:30:42,340 --> 06:30:43,220
What does 12 start?

4445
06:30:53,099 --> 06:30:53,659
Sorry.

4446
06:30:53,659 --> 06:30:54,220
I'm sorry.

4447
06:30:54,939 --> 06:30:55,180
Okay.

4448
06:30:55,180 --> 06:30:55,979
Let's get this up.

4449
06:30:55,979 --> 06:30:56,619
This is the one?

4450
06:30:57,939 --> 06:31:01,909
Well, it's got to be in the right spot.

4451
06:31:01,909 --> 06:31:03,029
Can you turn the phone off?

4452
06:31:03,669 --> 06:31:07,590
You come to an E3 conference and you don't turn your cell phone off?

4453
06:31:08,229 --> 06:31:09,860
Yeah.

4454
06:31:09,860 --> 06:31:10,900
Why don't you come up here then?

4455
06:31:22,540 --> 06:31:23,740
Oh, my God.

4456
06:31:24,860 --> 06:31:26,619
I'm just going to have to like leave it.

4457
06:31:26,619 --> 06:31:27,900
It's unworkable.

4458
06:31:31,099 --> 06:31:32,299
It just truly is.

4459
06:31:34,869 --> 06:31:36,790
You can't use this.

4460
06:31:38,229 --> 06:31:43,849
I'm going to have to redo everything.

4461
06:31:43,849 --> 06:31:46,409
I'm so excited and so ready to present to you.

4462
06:31:47,430 --> 06:31:48,389
I'm just going to do them all.

4463
06:31:48,389 --> 06:31:49,430
I'm going to do it twice.

4464
06:31:49,430 --> 06:31:49,909
Here we go.

4465
06:31:50,549 --> 06:31:51,049
Ah.

4466
06:31:56,919 --> 06:31:58,599
It's got to be done correct the first time.

4467
06:31:59,240 --> 06:32:01,349
Our new cat.

4468
06:32:03,459 --> 06:32:04,580
Can you turn the phone off?

4469
06:32:05,139 --> 06:32:09,130
You come to an E3 conference and you don't turn your cell phone off?

4470
06:32:09,849 --> 06:32:11,419
Yeah.

4471
06:32:11,419 --> 06:32:12,459
Why don't you come up here then?

4472
06:32:13,259 --> 06:32:13,819
Yeah.

4473
06:32:13,819 --> 06:32:14,540
Oh.

4474
06:32:14,540 --> 06:32:17,580
That's why don't you get up here and record it externally.

4475
06:32:17,580 --> 06:32:18,700
I don't think I can bring it in.

4476
06:32:18,700 --> 06:32:19,099
Can I?

4477
06:32:19,740 --> 06:32:22,360
I'd have to restart the game.

4478
06:32:25,349 --> 06:32:26,950
I think I'm just going too ambitious.

4479
06:32:27,509 --> 06:32:33,619
So what was 10?

4480
06:32:44,709 --> 06:32:45,669
No, there's nothing even here.

4481
06:32:46,310 --> 06:32:48,659
I got to move on from the intro.

4482
06:32:49,299 --> 06:32:54,979
Conference, you don't turn your cell phone off?

4483
06:32:54,979 --> 06:32:55,700
This one's fine.

4484
06:32:57,020 --> 06:32:57,180
Yeah.

4485
06:32:57,180 --> 06:32:58,299
Why don't you come up here then?

4486
06:32:59,099 --> 06:32:59,599
Yeah.

4487
06:33:00,380 --> 06:33:02,540
That's why don't you get up here and start talking to me.

4488
06:33:04,250 --> 06:33:04,729
This clip.

4489
06:33:05,290 --> 06:33:07,299
Okay.

4490
06:33:07,299 --> 06:33:09,770
Here we go.

4491
06:33:09,770 --> 06:33:10,650
Oh my God.

4492
06:33:10,650 --> 06:33:11,049
Hold on.

4493
06:33:11,689 --> 06:33:13,209
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4494
06:33:16,630 --> 06:33:18,069
I'm in close now.

4495
06:33:18,069 --> 06:33:23,529
I think I can do it from here.

4496
06:33:29,020 --> 06:33:29,900
Let's grab 12.

4497
06:33:34,900 --> 06:33:36,340
We have to just super enhance.

4498
06:33:42,099 --> 06:33:44,419
Yeah.

4499
06:33:44,419 --> 06:33:45,540
Oh my God.

4500
06:33:45,540 --> 06:33:48,419
I would literally do anything to be.

4501
06:33:50,020 --> 06:33:50,979
It's on top of it.

4502
06:33:50,979 --> 06:33:51,939
Why can't I click it?

4503
06:33:51,939 --> 06:33:53,380
It's on top.

4504
06:33:53,380 --> 06:33:54,900
It is on the top.

4505
06:33:55,619 --> 06:34:05,590
Come up here then.

4506
06:34:07,909 --> 06:34:09,830
Why don't you get up here and start talking to me?

4507
06:34:12,169 --> 06:34:12,889
Okay.

4508
06:34:12,889 --> 06:34:14,409
I'm fucking leaving it like this.

4509
06:34:19,060 --> 06:34:19,860
Turn the phone off.

4510
06:34:22,490 --> 06:34:23,610
I can grab it from here.

4511
06:34:23,610 --> 06:34:26,169
I guess you have to have a little tail out to even select it.

4512
06:34:26,169 --> 06:34:28,009
You come to an E3 conference.

4513
06:34:28,009 --> 06:34:29,049
You don't turn your cell phone off?

4514
06:34:29,049 --> 06:34:29,610
It didn't work.

4515
06:34:30,979 --> 06:34:31,380
Fuck you.

4516
06:34:31,380 --> 06:34:32,500
Why don't you come up here then?

4517
06:34:34,810 --> 06:34:37,049
Why don't you get up here and start talking to me?

4518
06:34:37,770 --> 06:34:38,409
I'm gonna get it.

4519
06:34:41,459 --> 06:34:42,020
I'm gonna get it.

4520
06:34:42,819 --> 06:34:46,580
I think that's closing up.

4521
06:34:50,439 --> 06:34:52,200
You come to an E3 conference.

4522
06:34:52,200 --> 06:34:52,680
You don't try.

4523
06:34:53,849 --> 06:34:54,810
We're stuck here forever.

4524
06:34:54,810 --> 06:34:56,889
We're stuck in like this loop forever.

4525
06:34:56,889 --> 06:34:57,529
Three conference.

4526
06:34:57,529 --> 06:34:58,729
You don't turn your cell phone off?

4527
06:34:59,529 --> 06:35:00,970
Yeah.

4528
06:35:00,970 --> 06:35:01,930
Why don't you just come up here then?

4529
06:35:01,930 --> 06:35:10,279
You got a 72% medical score across all your games.

4530
06:35:10,279 --> 06:35:12,279
Why don't you get up here and start talking to me?

4531
06:35:12,279 --> 06:35:12,840
I'm gonna get it.

4532
06:35:16,099 --> 06:35:16,659
I got it.

4533
06:35:33,849 --> 06:35:34,650
So excited.

4534
06:35:52,419 --> 06:35:53,220
So excited.

4535
06:35:54,580 --> 06:35:55,779
What happened here?

4536
06:35:56,680 --> 06:35:57,159
Why is it...

4537
06:35:58,439 --> 06:36:00,040
That's Osmond.

4538
06:36:00,040 --> 06:36:01,240
That's Michael.

4539
06:36:01,240 --> 06:36:02,680
And that's Gary.

4540
06:36:02,680 --> 06:36:04,360
The three of us are...

4541
06:36:10,869 --> 06:36:11,830
So excited.

4542
06:36:11,830 --> 06:36:12,869
So ex...

4543
06:36:12,869 --> 06:36:14,709
So, so, so...

4544
06:36:17,590 --> 06:36:21,590
The three of us are...

4545
06:36:22,229 --> 06:36:24,630
So, so, so...

4546
06:36:25,880 --> 06:36:26,119
Just...

4547
06:36:28,139 --> 06:36:28,939
So excited.

4548
06:36:28,939 --> 06:36:30,540
And so ready to present to you.

4549
06:36:30,540 --> 06:36:31,040
Sorry.

4550
06:36:31,819 --> 06:36:39,849
It's not possible.

4551
06:36:39,849 --> 06:36:45,159
There's a folder for the movies in my documents.

4552
06:36:45,159 --> 06:36:46,840
You put a wav file in there.

4553
06:36:46,840 --> 06:36:47,799
Wait, what?

4554
06:36:47,799 --> 06:36:54,540
Is that for real?

4555
06:37:09,529 --> 06:37:11,610
If I put a wav in my documents,

4556
06:37:11,610 --> 06:37:12,889
I don't have to close the game, you're saying?

4557
06:37:15,259 --> 06:37:16,380
Documents the movies.

4558
06:37:18,310 --> 06:37:19,349
Movie sounds.

4559
06:37:22,680 --> 06:37:24,119
Oh, would you look at that?

4560
06:37:24,119 --> 06:37:25,000
Holy shit.

4561
06:37:25,000 --> 06:37:25,560
Okay.

4562
06:37:25,560 --> 06:37:26,599
It's possible.

4563
06:37:26,599 --> 06:37:32,540
I got them all right here.

4564
06:37:32,540 --> 06:37:34,680
Okay, hold on.

4565
06:37:34,680 --> 06:37:35,159
Give me a second.

4566
06:37:41,500 --> 06:37:44,459
We are just so excited to have you...

4567
06:37:44,459 --> 06:37:46,340
Actually, all I need is the...

4568
06:37:46,979 --> 06:37:47,380
All right.

4569
06:37:47,380 --> 06:37:48,180
This is gonna be hard though,

4570
06:37:48,180 --> 06:37:48,500
because I don't...

4571
06:37:51,080 --> 06:37:52,040
I don't have borderless windows,

4572
06:37:52,040 --> 06:37:53,720
so I have to like fucking rip down

4573
06:37:53,720 --> 06:37:54,919
every single time I want to change.

4574
06:37:55,560 --> 06:37:57,450
You know what I mean?

4575
06:37:57,450 --> 06:37:58,569
I can't like have it open

4576
06:37:58,569 --> 06:37:59,930
and record it at the same time.

4577
06:38:02,409 --> 06:38:05,209
Like it's hard, hard, full screen.

4578
06:38:05,770 --> 06:38:08,860
See what I'm saying?

4579
06:38:08,860 --> 06:38:10,700
Like the audacity is on the other monitor.

4580
06:38:11,259 --> 06:38:15,979
So I have to like...

4581
06:38:15,979 --> 06:38:17,020
I can't lip sync it.

4582
06:38:17,659 --> 06:38:22,459
Just watch a clip of it.

4583
06:38:23,500 --> 06:38:25,669
All right, let me just see how this looks.

4584
06:38:26,229 --> 06:38:27,110
Present to you.

4585
06:38:27,110 --> 06:38:27,669
Sorry.

4586
06:38:27,669 --> 06:38:28,229
I'm sorry.

4587
06:38:29,029 --> 06:38:32,060
Turn the music off.

4588
06:38:33,419 --> 06:38:35,799
Can I turn this music off?

4589
06:38:36,759 --> 06:38:38,680
Can you turn the phone off?

4590
06:38:38,680 --> 06:38:40,360
I turned it on silent, but it didn't work.

4591
06:38:40,360 --> 06:38:42,200
You come to an E3 conference

4592
06:38:42,200 --> 06:38:43,400
and you don't turn your cell phone off?

4593
06:38:44,729 --> 06:38:46,810
Yeah, oh, you got a 72%

4594
06:38:46,810 --> 06:38:48,889
Metacritic score across all your games.

4595
06:38:48,889 --> 06:38:50,009
Why don't you get up here

4596
06:38:50,009 --> 06:38:50,889
and start talking to me?

4597
06:38:51,610 --> 06:38:57,669
Okay, I got to link actors here.

4598
06:38:57,669 --> 06:38:59,270
I wish I could just give me two of these.

4599
06:38:59,270 --> 06:39:01,270
Give me two audio timelines.

4600
06:39:01,270 --> 06:39:01,770
Just...

4601
06:39:12,470 --> 06:39:12,790
I think...

4602
06:39:12,790 --> 06:39:14,950
I think it's not gonna work.

4603
06:39:14,950 --> 06:39:15,909
I'm gonna have to redo them all.

4604
06:39:16,729 --> 06:39:17,130
Just redo...

4605
06:39:17,130 --> 06:39:18,169
I'm gonna redo it all.

4606
06:39:18,169 --> 06:39:19,860
Here we go.

4607
06:39:19,860 --> 06:39:21,669
And then I'm moving on.

4608
06:39:21,669 --> 06:39:22,790
I'm only doing this two...

4609
06:39:22,790 --> 06:39:23,270
That's it.

4610
06:39:23,270 --> 06:39:24,069
I'm only doing this twice.

4611
06:39:41,299 --> 06:39:43,060
Okay, so I need the ringtone.

4612
06:39:45,130 --> 06:39:45,689
All right, here we go.

4613
06:39:47,139 --> 06:39:48,099
That's Michael.

4614
06:39:48,979 --> 06:39:50,180
It's time to call my editors.

4615
06:39:50,180 --> 06:39:51,299
It's time to call...

4616
06:39:51,299 --> 06:39:54,340
Please, God, give me one other timeline

4617
06:39:54,340 --> 06:39:56,259
and let me drag and trim clips.

4618
06:39:56,259 --> 06:39:57,380
What were you thinking?

4619
06:40:01,380 --> 06:40:03,380
It was like 2003.

4620
06:40:03,380 --> 06:40:04,819
So, here we go.

4621
06:40:04,819 --> 06:40:08,520
Here we go.

4622
06:40:08,520 --> 06:40:10,919
Two new releases upcoming

4623
06:40:10,919 --> 06:40:13,720
in our catalog of oh my God entertainment games.

4624
06:40:13,720 --> 06:40:15,319
That's Osmond.

4625
06:40:15,319 --> 06:40:16,520
That's Michael.

4626
06:40:16,520 --> 06:40:17,880
And that's Gary.

4627
06:40:17,880 --> 06:40:22,200
The three of us are so excited for you to be here

4628
06:40:22,200 --> 06:40:23,560
at this E3N.

4629
06:40:24,919 --> 06:40:25,560
I can hear that.

4630
06:40:25,560 --> 06:40:26,919
I can hear something over here.

4631
06:40:28,869 --> 06:40:30,549
Can you turn off the phone?

4632
06:40:31,349 --> 06:40:31,909
Turn the phone...

4633
06:40:32,810 --> 06:40:34,889
Another one of you fucking idiots has a phone on.

4634
06:40:35,529 --> 06:40:36,889
Turn the phone off!

4635
06:40:36,889 --> 06:40:39,689
You're gonna come to E.T. and try to come to my conference?

4636
06:40:40,630 --> 06:40:41,430
That's two phones.

4637
06:40:42,229 --> 06:40:43,270
Come on, get up here then.

4638
06:40:43,270 --> 06:40:44,389
Get up here, motherfucker.

4639
06:40:44,389 --> 06:40:45,189
I'll take it right now.

4640
06:40:45,590 --> 06:40:46,090
I...

4641
06:40:47,979 --> 06:40:48,479
Don't ever...

4642
06:40:49,979 --> 06:40:50,540
My head hurts.

4643
06:40:56,540 --> 06:40:57,099
Got it.

4644
06:40:57,099 --> 06:41:00,970
Don't touch anything.

4645
06:41:00,970 --> 06:41:05,130
New releases upcoming in our catalog of oh my God entertainment games.

4646
06:41:05,130 --> 06:41:06,729
That's Osmond.

4647
06:41:06,729 --> 06:41:07,849
That's Michael.

4648
06:41:07,849 --> 06:41:09,290
And that's Gary.

4649
06:41:09,290 --> 06:41:14,970
The three of us are so excited for you to be here at this E3N.

4650
06:41:21,220 --> 06:41:22,250
I can hear that.

4651
06:41:22,250 --> 06:41:23,529
I can hear something over here.

4652
06:41:26,200 --> 06:41:27,240
Can you turn off the phone?

4653
06:41:27,959 --> 06:41:28,520
Turn the phone...

4654
06:41:31,750 --> 06:41:33,669
Another one of you fucking idiots has a phone...

4655
06:41:34,389 --> 06:41:44,009
All right, let me link this audio, this one, to Studio Head.

4656
06:41:45,419 --> 06:41:48,779
Linking sound to actor will process the sound for lip-syncing information.

4657
06:41:49,419 --> 06:41:55,500
Due to the length of the clip, the lip-syncing quality may diminish slightly.

4658
06:41:58,659 --> 06:42:01,299
That's Michael and that's Gary.

4659
06:42:01,299 --> 06:42:02,979
The three of us are...

4660
06:42:08,419 --> 06:42:10,220
Let me ask you this though.

4661
06:42:11,159 --> 06:42:12,040
What just happened?

4662
06:42:15,060 --> 06:42:16,099
Now it's not even...

4663
06:42:16,099 --> 06:42:17,139
How is it not synced up?

4664
06:42:17,139 --> 06:42:17,939
I didn't do anything.

4665
06:42:17,939 --> 06:42:23,139
The three of us are so excited for you to be here at this E3N.

4666
06:42:23,139 --> 06:42:23,619
No, it's fine.

4667
06:42:24,900 --> 06:42:25,540
I can hear that.

4668
06:42:25,540 --> 06:42:27,060
I can hear something over here.

4669
06:42:27,060 --> 06:42:27,860
No, it's not gonna work.

4670
06:42:29,459 --> 06:42:30,500
Can you turn off the phone?

4671
06:42:32,500 --> 06:42:34,900
Another one of you fucking idiots has a phone on.

4672
06:42:35,540 --> 06:42:36,900
Turn the phone up.

4673
06:42:36,900 --> 06:42:39,619
You're gonna come to E-Team and try to come to my conference?

4674
06:42:40,580 --> 06:42:41,380
That's two phones.

4675
06:42:42,180 --> 06:42:43,220
Come on, get up here then.

4676
06:42:43,220 --> 06:42:44,259
Get up here, motherfucker.

4677
06:42:44,340 --> 06:42:45,139
I'll take you right now.

4678
06:42:47,930 --> 06:42:48,409
Don't ever...

4679
06:42:49,049 --> 06:42:50,490
My head hurts.

4680
06:42:51,689 --> 06:42:52,810
Okay, it fucking worked.

4681
06:42:53,849 --> 06:42:55,689
I just have to get this right.

4682
06:42:55,689 --> 06:42:58,970
I've got to get this one right and then I've got to get it perfect.

4683
06:43:03,340 --> 06:43:03,979
Here we go.

4684
06:43:03,979 --> 06:43:04,779
It's got to be perfect.

4685
06:43:05,659 --> 06:43:08,220
That's Michael and that's Gary.

4686
06:43:08,220 --> 06:43:14,220
The three of us are so excited for you to be here at this E3N.

4687
06:43:15,580 --> 06:43:17,540
I can hear something over here.

4688
06:43:17,619 --> 06:43:18,020
That's me.

4689
06:43:18,020 --> 06:43:18,500
I'm sorry.

4690
06:43:20,259 --> 06:43:21,220
Can you turn off the phone?

4691
06:43:23,459 --> 06:43:25,299
Another one of you fucking idiots has a phone on.

4692
06:43:25,299 --> 06:43:26,259
That's my phone.

4693
06:43:26,259 --> 06:43:27,060
Turn the phone up.

4694
06:43:27,619 --> 06:43:30,340
You're gonna come to E-Team and try to come to my conference?

4695
06:43:30,340 --> 06:43:31,299
Fuck you.

4696
06:43:31,299 --> 06:43:32,580
That's two phones.

4697
06:43:32,580 --> 06:43:33,939
Your company sucks.

4698
06:43:33,939 --> 06:43:34,979
42% medic.

4699
06:43:34,979 --> 06:43:36,180
I'm going up there.

4700
06:43:36,180 --> 06:43:36,979
What are you gonna do about it?

4701
06:43:38,650 --> 06:43:39,130
Don't ever...

4702
06:43:40,650 --> 06:43:41,209
My head hurts.

4703
06:43:44,979 --> 06:43:45,779
Got it.

4704
06:43:45,779 --> 06:43:47,099
Done.

4705
06:43:47,099 --> 06:43:47,900
Print it.

4706
06:43:47,900 --> 06:43:48,860
Ship it out.

4707
06:43:48,860 --> 06:43:51,819
Excited to show you two new releases

4708
06:43:51,819 --> 06:43:55,180
upcoming in our catalog of oh my god entertainment games.

4709
06:43:55,180 --> 06:43:56,779
That's Osmond.

4710
06:43:56,779 --> 06:43:59,340
That's Michael and that's Gary.

4711
06:43:59,340 --> 06:44:04,779
The three of us are so excited for you to be here at this E3N.

4712
06:44:06,299 --> 06:44:06,939
I can hear that.

4713
06:44:06,939 --> 06:44:08,299
I can hear something over here.

4714
06:44:08,299 --> 06:44:08,700
That's me.

4715
06:44:08,700 --> 06:44:09,180
I'm sorry.

4716
06:44:10,939 --> 06:44:11,900
Can you turn off the phone?

4717
06:44:14,180 --> 06:44:16,020
Another one of you fucking idiots has a phone on.

4718
06:44:16,020 --> 06:44:16,979
That's my phone.

4719
06:44:16,979 --> 06:44:17,779
Turn the phone up.

4720
06:44:18,259 --> 06:44:20,979
You're gonna come to E-Team and try to come to my conference?

4721
06:44:20,979 --> 06:44:21,459
Fuck you.

4722
06:44:22,020 --> 06:44:22,740
That's two phones.

4723
06:44:23,299 --> 06:44:24,580
Your company sucks.

4724
06:44:24,580 --> 06:44:25,700
42% medic.

4725
06:44:25,700 --> 06:44:26,819
I'm going up there right now.

4726
06:44:26,819 --> 06:44:27,619
What are you gonna do about it?

4727
06:44:29,299 --> 06:44:29,779
Don't ever...

4728
06:44:30,419 --> 06:44:30,740
My head...

4729
06:44:30,740 --> 06:44:31,299
I'm gonna...

4730
06:44:31,299 --> 06:44:31,939
My head hurts.

4731
06:44:34,810 --> 06:44:35,369
You know what?

4732
06:44:35,369 --> 06:44:37,450
This is like the equivalent of trying to edit a video

4733
06:44:37,450 --> 06:44:39,290
while you're like swimming upstream.

4734
06:44:43,529 --> 06:44:45,049
It's like trying to like make a video

4735
06:44:45,049 --> 06:44:53,750
about somebody dumping like a bucket of water on your head.

4736
06:44:53,750 --> 06:44:57,029
What I just did right there takes like 36 seconds.

4737
06:44:57,029 --> 06:44:59,610
God damn salmon.

4738
06:44:59,610 --> 06:45:08,919
That takes like eight seconds.

4739
06:45:15,580 --> 06:45:15,900
Okay.

4740
06:45:15,900 --> 06:45:16,779
Here we go.

4741
06:45:23,430 --> 06:45:24,790
Now we just have to get the reactions.

4742
06:45:28,409 --> 06:45:29,209
Thank you.

4743
06:45:29,209 --> 06:45:30,810
Hey, hey, you in the back.

4744
06:45:30,810 --> 06:45:36,700
I just wish I could shut this off.

4745
06:45:39,380 --> 06:45:39,619
Okay.

4746
06:45:39,619 --> 06:45:40,340
Here we go.

4747
06:45:40,340 --> 06:45:49,930
Should they clap for this?

4748
06:45:56,009 --> 06:45:58,810
I think I have to turn off like the ambient sounds too.

4749
06:45:58,810 --> 06:45:59,529
Because all you just...

4750
06:46:02,729 --> 06:46:04,090
Who the fuck is that person?

4751
06:46:06,229 --> 06:46:08,439
I can hear something over here.

4752
06:46:08,439 --> 06:46:08,840
That's me.

4753
06:46:08,840 --> 06:46:09,319
I'm sorry.

4754
06:46:10,279 --> 06:46:10,919
Can you turn...

4755
06:46:10,919 --> 06:46:11,880
Can you turn off the phone?

4756
06:46:12,680 --> 06:46:14,150
Turn the phone.

4757
06:46:14,150 --> 06:46:16,069
Another one of you fucking idiots has a phone on.

4758
06:46:16,069 --> 06:46:16,950
That's my phone.

4759
06:46:16,950 --> 06:46:17,750
Turn the phone up.

4760
06:46:18,310 --> 06:46:21,110
You're gonna come to ET and try to come to my conference?

4761
06:46:21,110 --> 06:46:21,990
Fuck you.

4762
06:46:21,990 --> 06:46:22,389
That's too...

4763
06:46:25,830 --> 06:46:27,029
Paid audience.

4764
06:46:55,509 --> 06:46:56,630
So happy to be here.

4765
06:46:56,630 --> 06:46:58,229
We are beyond excited to show...

4766
06:46:59,189 --> 06:47:00,250
All right.

4767
06:47:00,250 --> 06:47:01,209
Let's put in some booze.

4768
06:47:15,720 --> 06:47:17,159
This is where all the effort's gone.

4769
06:47:33,619 --> 06:47:34,740
Can you turn off the phone?

4770
06:47:36,979 --> 06:47:38,580
Another one of you fucking idiots has a...

4771
06:47:39,220 --> 06:47:40,740
Is it like a gasp?

4772
06:47:41,459 --> 06:48:00,299
It's a laugh, scream, slurp, sniff, snore, spit.

4773
06:48:00,299 --> 06:48:08,869
That's my phone.

4774
06:48:11,029 --> 06:48:11,990
Idiots has a phone.

4775
06:48:11,990 --> 06:48:12,790
That's my phone.

4776
06:48:12,790 --> 06:48:13,290
Turn the...

4777
06:48:17,240 --> 06:48:18,200
Just spitting.

4778
06:48:22,040 --> 06:48:24,759
One guy just turns it like medieval times.

4779
06:48:26,840 --> 06:48:29,299
That's what I think about your conference.

4780
06:48:37,580 --> 06:48:38,299
That's my phone.

4781
06:48:38,459 --> 06:48:39,259
Turn the phone up.

4782
06:48:39,740 --> 06:48:42,700
You're gonna come to ET and try to come to my conference?

4783
06:48:42,700 --> 06:48:43,200
Fuck you.

4784
06:48:49,319 --> 06:48:51,319
Somebody's just gonna laugh after that.

4785
06:48:51,319 --> 06:48:51,799
Fuck you.

4786
06:48:52,919 --> 06:48:54,569
Try to come to my conference?

4787
06:48:54,569 --> 06:48:55,049
Fuck you.

4788
06:48:57,750 --> 06:48:58,549
That's two phones.

4789
06:48:59,990 --> 06:49:00,950
That's not...

4790
06:49:01,990 --> 06:49:05,860
I thought that was a laugh.

4791
06:49:07,000 --> 06:49:08,520
That's a chicken, apparently.

4792
06:49:08,520 --> 06:49:15,340
Fuck you.

4793
06:49:19,619 --> 06:49:20,340
Fuck you.

4794
06:49:20,340 --> 06:49:21,220
That's two phones.

4795
06:49:21,939 --> 06:49:22,659
Come on, get off of me.

4796
06:49:22,659 --> 06:49:23,139
Sucks.

4797
06:49:23,139 --> 06:49:24,340
42% of magic.

4798
06:49:24,340 --> 06:49:25,459
Stop going up there.

4799
06:49:25,459 --> 06:49:25,939
What are you gonna do?

4800
06:49:29,860 --> 06:49:32,759
What?

4801
06:49:33,000 --> 06:49:35,080
Why does this mysteriously move?

4802
06:49:36,139 --> 06:49:36,779
Conference?

4803
06:49:36,779 --> 06:49:37,580
Fuck you.

4804
06:49:37,580 --> 06:49:38,380
That's two phones.

4805
06:49:39,580 --> 06:49:39,819
Get off of me.

4806
06:49:39,819 --> 06:49:40,380
Sucks.

4807
06:49:40,380 --> 06:49:41,500
42% of magic.

4808
06:49:41,500 --> 06:49:42,619
Stop going up there.

4809
06:49:42,619 --> 06:49:43,180
What are you gonna do?

4810
06:49:54,389 --> 06:49:55,830
One, two, three.

4811
06:50:09,110 --> 06:50:19,959
What does this sound like?

4812
06:50:33,450 --> 06:50:35,209
What sound even is this?

4813
06:50:35,529 --> 06:50:36,009
What are you gonna do?

4814
06:50:42,549 --> 06:50:43,349
Apparently, I don't know.

4815
06:50:48,970 --> 06:50:50,330
Neck breaking sound.

4816
06:50:50,330 --> 06:50:50,810
Hold on.

4817
06:50:54,299 --> 06:50:55,099
Bone break.

4818
06:51:03,450 --> 06:51:03,930
What are you gonna do?

4819
06:51:14,889 --> 06:51:17,049
I'm so desperately trying to...

4820
06:51:17,049 --> 06:51:17,529
What are you gonna do?

4821
06:51:21,049 --> 06:51:22,330
It was a double tap.

4822
06:51:27,770 --> 06:51:29,419
That's like...

4823
06:51:29,419 --> 06:51:30,939
It's not loud enough.

4824
06:51:30,939 --> 06:51:40,549
Why do you guys want, like, breaking bones so bad?

4825
06:51:40,549 --> 06:51:41,750
A nice crunchy one.

4826
06:51:41,750 --> 06:51:43,830
Bone break 02.

4827
06:51:44,549 --> 06:51:45,880
How's this one?

4828
06:51:49,049 --> 06:51:50,569
Okay, that's really bad.

4829
06:51:50,569 --> 06:51:52,729
That's really, really, really, really awful.

4830
06:52:10,650 --> 06:52:13,049
The thing is, who's neck is breaking here?

4831
06:52:16,619 --> 06:52:18,060
It could be either one of them.

4832
06:52:18,540 --> 06:52:19,099
What are you gonna do?

4833
06:52:19,099 --> 06:52:19,819
Get out.

4834
06:52:20,540 --> 06:52:21,750
Don't hurt me.

4835
06:52:21,750 --> 06:52:22,150
On my head.

4836
06:52:22,150 --> 06:52:23,029
I'm gonna fuck my...

4837
06:52:59,099 --> 06:52:59,580
Okay.

4838
06:53:00,139 --> 06:53:01,779
What are you gonna do?

4839
06:53:01,779 --> 06:53:02,340
Get out.

4840
06:53:02,340 --> 06:53:11,110
Don't hurt me.

4841
06:53:11,110 --> 06:53:12,150
Don't hurt me.

4842
06:53:12,150 --> 06:53:12,630
Whatever.

4843
06:53:13,270 --> 06:53:18,650
We need to fade this out.

4844
06:53:18,650 --> 06:53:19,930
I gotta fade out.

4845
06:53:19,930 --> 06:53:28,220
Okay, so this is the first game.

4846
06:53:28,220 --> 06:53:33,099
I need to fade out transition here.

4847
06:53:33,099 --> 06:53:34,860
No, no fart on fall.

4848
06:53:34,860 --> 06:53:36,139
Absolutely not.

4849
06:53:36,139 --> 06:53:36,700
No way.

4850
06:53:37,500 --> 06:53:38,700
Absolutely not.

4851
06:53:38,700 --> 06:53:41,909
Fade in.

4852
06:53:41,909 --> 06:53:49,939
This goes so quickly to the next clip.

4853
06:53:49,939 --> 06:53:59,750
All right, not in-game footage.

4854
06:53:59,750 --> 06:54:08,919
All right, we're moving on.

4855
06:54:08,919 --> 06:54:15,419
The last fart went over so well.

4856
06:54:15,419 --> 06:54:18,680
We're not doing another fart.

4857
06:54:18,680 --> 06:54:19,880
World Premiere.

4858
06:54:19,880 --> 06:54:20,439
Yeah, hold on.

4859
06:54:26,869 --> 06:54:28,229
World Premiere.

4860
06:54:28,229 --> 06:54:30,500
That was awful!

4861
06:54:30,500 --> 06:54:31,779
Oh, that was bad.

4862
06:54:31,779 --> 06:54:34,950
That was terrible.

4863
06:54:34,950 --> 06:54:37,590
I'm not deleting this one as soon as possible.

4864
06:54:41,610 --> 06:54:42,970
That was awful!

4865
06:54:49,720 --> 06:54:50,119
Awful.

4866
06:54:57,450 --> 06:54:58,490
World Premiere.

4867
06:54:59,450 --> 06:55:02,540
Don't die on me!

4868
06:55:02,540 --> 06:55:06,659
Don't you die on me!

4869
06:55:06,659 --> 06:55:07,900
Come on!

4870
06:55:07,900 --> 06:55:09,669
No!

4871
06:55:09,669 --> 06:55:11,189
You're my co-captain!

4872
06:55:11,750 --> 06:55:13,240
You're my co-pilot!

4873
06:55:28,220 --> 06:55:28,619
No!

4874
06:55:43,430 --> 06:55:44,150
Don't die on me!

4875
06:55:44,950 --> 06:55:48,840
Don't you die on me!

4876
06:55:48,840 --> 06:55:49,939
Come on!

4877
06:55:49,939 --> 06:55:52,200
No!

4878
06:55:52,200 --> 06:55:53,639
My co-captain!

4879
06:55:53,639 --> 06:55:55,299
You're my co-pilot!

4880
06:56:15,669 --> 06:56:17,270
Forest exposition.

4881
06:56:24,740 --> 06:56:25,459
Don't die on me!

4882
06:56:27,700 --> 06:56:28,180
Will it work?

4883
06:56:28,979 --> 06:56:30,259
Don't you die on me!

4884
06:56:30,259 --> 06:56:32,500
Come on!

4885
06:56:32,500 --> 06:56:33,610
No!

4886
06:56:33,610 --> 06:56:35,049
My co-captain!

4887
06:56:35,049 --> 06:56:36,409
You're my co-

4888
06:56:36,409 --> 06:56:40,360
All right, we need a subtitle.

4889
06:56:40,360 --> 06:56:42,759
How do I add a subtitle here?

4890
06:56:42,759 --> 06:56:50,740
Reviewing technology?

4891
06:56:50,740 --> 06:56:51,139
Where is it?

4892
06:56:53,529 --> 06:56:54,409
Oh, no, don't worry.

4893
06:56:54,409 --> 06:56:55,930
I'm gonna add sounds.

4894
06:56:55,930 --> 06:57:00,569
Where is it?

4895
06:57:05,509 --> 06:57:06,709
World Premiere.

4896
06:57:07,669 --> 06:57:32,950
Oh, here we go.

4897
06:57:32,950 --> 06:57:33,990
World Premiere.

4898
06:57:36,919 --> 06:57:37,639
Don't die on me!

4899
06:57:42,580 --> 06:57:46,650
Don't die on me!

4900
06:57:46,650 --> 06:57:47,529
Don't you die on me!

4901
06:57:48,090 --> 06:57:50,200
Come on!

4902
06:57:50,200 --> 06:57:51,290
No!

4903
06:57:51,290 --> 06:57:52,330
My co-captain!

4904
06:57:52,810 --> 06:57:56,090
You're my co-pilot!

4905
06:57:56,090 --> 06:57:56,810
Please, lip sync.

4906
06:58:07,900 --> 06:58:09,340
Come on, do it!

4907
06:58:09,340 --> 06:58:09,840
No!

4908
06:58:26,520 --> 06:58:30,659
I'm getting strange readings coming from upstairs.

4909
06:58:30,659 --> 06:58:32,659
I wonder if that isn't anything to do with the-

4910
06:58:34,419 --> 06:58:35,060
Normality!

4911
06:58:35,060 --> 06:58:35,619
What is that?

4912
06:58:36,419 --> 06:58:36,919
Oh!

4913
06:58:39,060 --> 06:58:40,340
This one's washed, but it's-

4914
06:58:44,409 --> 06:58:48,229
I'm getting strange readings coming from upstairs.

4915
06:58:48,950 --> 06:58:50,869
I wonder if that isn't anything to do with the-

4916
06:58:51,909 --> 06:58:52,409
The-

4917
06:58:52,709 --> 06:58:53,270
Normality!

4918
06:58:53,270 --> 06:58:53,909
What is that?

4919
06:58:54,709 --> 06:58:55,209
Oh!

4920
06:58:59,029 --> 06:59:00,389
No, that's, like, too awful.

4921
06:59:21,720 --> 06:59:24,520
Yeah, I'm getting a reading about something-

4922
06:59:25,560 --> 06:59:27,930
Organic creature up here.

4923
06:59:27,930 --> 06:59:28,409
I don't know.

4924
06:59:28,409 --> 06:59:29,049
Does anybody have a-

4925
06:59:29,049 --> 06:59:29,549
Dog!

4926
06:59:42,389 --> 06:59:45,979
I'm getting a reading of a strange creature up here.

4927
06:59:45,979 --> 06:59:47,340
I don't know what it could be.

4928
06:59:47,340 --> 06:59:51,500
Possibly an organic compound.

4929
06:59:51,500 --> 06:59:52,299
What is that?

4930
06:59:52,299 --> 06:59:52,799
Oh.

4931
06:59:53,419 --> 07:00:02,740
I'm getting a reading of a strange creature up here.

4932
07:00:02,740 --> 07:00:04,169
I don't know what it could be.

4933
07:00:04,169 --> 07:00:06,409
Possibly an organic compound.

4934
07:00:06,409 --> 07:00:09,189
What is that?

4935
07:00:09,189 --> 07:00:09,689
Oh.

4936
07:00:17,419 --> 07:00:17,919
That's it.

4937
07:00:18,700 --> 07:00:19,200
Oh.

4938
07:00:19,580 --> 07:00:20,220
That's what happens.

4939
07:00:20,220 --> 07:00:20,860
You say, oh.

4940
07:00:22,119 --> 07:00:24,040
It's NPC dialogue right there.

4941
07:01:17,849 --> 07:01:19,450
I need a new song.

4942
07:01:21,130 --> 07:01:22,169
We gotta get rid of this thing.

4943
07:01:24,819 --> 07:01:25,540
Alien Planet.

4944
07:01:25,540 --> 07:01:26,099
Let's try this.

4945
07:01:28,310 --> 07:01:28,810
Stop.

4946
07:01:43,270 --> 07:01:47,849
You die on me.

4947
07:01:47,849 --> 07:01:54,500
You die on me.

4948
07:01:54,500 --> 07:01:55,000
No!

4949
07:01:55,000 --> 07:01:57,619
You're my co-captain!

4950
07:01:57,619 --> 07:01:58,659
You're my co-pilot!

4951
07:02:11,779 --> 07:02:13,700
Yes, I gotta trim that.

4952
07:02:13,700 --> 07:02:14,200
No!

4953
07:02:16,970 --> 07:02:19,639
I'm getting a reading of a strange creature up here.

4954
07:02:19,639 --> 07:02:20,680
Why a creature?

4955
07:02:20,680 --> 07:02:21,180
Why-

4956
07:02:21,479 --> 07:02:22,599
I'm redoing this line.

4957
07:02:22,599 --> 07:02:23,880
I'm redoing that line.

4958
07:02:23,880 --> 07:02:27,560
I'm getting a reading of a strange creature up here.

4959
07:02:27,560 --> 07:02:28,779
I don't know what it could be.

4960
07:02:28,779 --> 07:02:30,540
Possibly an organic compound.

4961
07:02:32,950 --> 07:02:33,750
What is that?

4962
07:02:33,750 --> 07:02:34,250
Oh.

4963
07:02:35,029 --> 07:02:35,509
Right here.

4964
07:02:35,509 --> 07:02:37,029
Like, the worst fucking sound you've ever heard.

4965
07:02:44,090 --> 07:02:50,659
That's not the worst.

4966
07:02:50,659 --> 07:02:51,159
That's like a-

4967
07:02:51,860 --> 07:02:53,369
Like a pinball.

4968
07:02:54,009 --> 07:02:59,340
Camera snapshot.

4969
07:03:01,590 --> 07:03:02,630
She's taking a picture.

4970
07:03:16,090 --> 07:03:17,529
That scream is too loud.

4971
07:03:22,150 --> 07:03:27,290
Okay, hold on.

4972
07:03:27,290 --> 07:03:28,090
Let me fix-

4973
07:03:28,090 --> 07:03:29,130
Get some of the audio in here.

4974
07:03:30,229 --> 07:03:31,270
World premiere.

4975
07:03:34,119 --> 07:03:34,840
Don't die on me!

4976
07:03:35,799 --> 07:03:44,549
That was just coughing into their mouth.

4977
07:03:57,060 --> 07:03:57,560
Wait.

4978
07:04:00,459 --> 07:04:00,959
Die!

4979
07:04:07,849 --> 07:04:08,729
That's pretty perfect.

4980
07:04:12,540 --> 07:04:13,099
Die on me!

4981
07:04:14,490 --> 07:04:14,990
Come on!

4982
07:04:26,759 --> 07:04:27,639
Slurp four.

4983
07:04:36,060 --> 07:04:38,299
What are you doing to their mouth?

4984
07:04:40,540 --> 07:04:41,659
Die on me!

4985
07:04:41,659 --> 07:04:42,330
Come on!

4986
07:04:44,919 --> 07:04:45,880
My co-captain!

4987
07:04:46,900 --> 07:04:47,939
You're my co-pilot!

4988
07:05:17,060 --> 07:05:17,619
Die on me!

4989
07:05:18,259 --> 07:05:18,759
Come on!

4990
07:05:20,310 --> 07:05:20,810
No!

4991
07:05:21,349 --> 07:05:22,310
My co-captain!

4992
07:05:23,029 --> 07:05:24,380
You're my co-pilot!

4993
07:05:37,240 --> 07:05:38,759
You're not even doing CPR.

4994
07:05:38,759 --> 07:05:39,259
You're like-

4995
07:05:40,040 --> 07:05:40,540
What are you-

4996
07:05:46,279 --> 07:05:46,779
Okay.

4997
07:05:47,159 --> 07:05:48,279
I think that works pretty well.

4998
07:05:48,840 --> 07:05:50,759
I'm fucking disgusted.

4999
07:05:54,900 --> 07:05:55,860
You're my co-pilot!

5000
07:06:21,740 --> 07:06:22,779
Spit it out.

5001
07:06:23,819 --> 07:06:25,979
It's a slurp and then it's a spit.

5002
07:06:27,080 --> 07:06:27,580
Ugh.

5003
07:06:44,819 --> 07:06:45,319
Should I put-

5004
07:06:52,650 --> 07:06:54,490
What if I did the spit instead?

5005
07:06:57,080 --> 07:06:58,360
The spit in the first-

5006
07:06:58,360 --> 07:06:58,860
You're my co-

5007
07:07:04,819 --> 07:07:06,020
It's hard to control.

5008
07:07:06,020 --> 07:07:06,520
Pilot!

5009
07:07:35,180 --> 07:07:35,979
I can't make-

5010
07:07:35,979 --> 07:07:36,619
I gotta be careful.

5011
07:07:36,619 --> 07:07:38,060
I'm gonna accidentally click on something.

5012
07:07:38,060 --> 07:07:38,560
Come on!

5013
07:07:58,869 --> 07:07:59,669
Does lipstick work?

5014
07:07:59,669 --> 07:08:00,630
The lipstick is working.

5015
07:08:03,159 --> 07:08:05,159
I'm getting a reading of a strange creature up here.

5016
07:08:05,720 --> 07:08:06,680
I don't know what it could be.

5017
07:08:06,680 --> 07:08:07,180
It pos-

5018
07:08:15,259 --> 07:08:15,759
What?

5019
07:08:17,270 --> 07:08:18,229
Organic compound.

5020
07:08:19,430 --> 07:08:21,450
No.

5021
07:08:23,400 --> 07:08:24,919
My whole fucking body hurts.

5022
07:08:31,130 --> 07:08:32,009
Thunder clap?

5023
07:08:33,020 --> 07:08:33,979
Oh, Jesus!

5024
07:08:41,340 --> 07:08:42,380
I need like bones.

5025
07:08:54,729 --> 07:08:55,770
Jesus Christ.

5026
07:09:04,680 --> 07:09:05,400
Where is it?

5027
07:09:05,400 --> 07:09:07,689
Um, okay.

5028
07:09:07,689 --> 07:09:09,450
It's human sounds and then it's-

5029
07:09:09,450 --> 07:09:11,740
It's crunching bones.

5030
07:09:12,380 --> 07:09:13,020
I think, right?

5031
07:09:14,619 --> 07:09:19,060
I don't know.

5032
07:09:22,229 --> 07:09:23,349
It's weapon sounds?

5033
07:09:23,349 --> 07:09:25,029
Is it violent sounds?

5034
07:09:25,029 --> 07:09:25,669
It's gone.

5035
07:09:25,669 --> 07:09:28,069
I- I hope I don't have to do any more characters because it's gone.

5036
07:09:28,709 --> 07:09:29,799
I don't have to do any-

5037
07:09:29,799 --> 07:09:30,919
I hope I don't have to do any more.

5038
07:09:31,479 --> 07:09:32,520
Hold on, let me get some water.

5039
07:09:32,520 --> 07:09:42,200
Oh, it's gotta be different than that.

5040
07:09:42,759 --> 07:09:55,979
What is that?

5041
07:09:57,779 --> 07:09:58,180
Should he-

5042
07:09:58,180 --> 07:09:58,979
Should he break out?

5043
07:10:02,119 --> 07:10:03,080
I don't know what it could be.

5044
07:10:03,080 --> 07:10:03,580
It pos-

5045
07:10:07,340 --> 07:10:08,220
What is that?

5046
07:10:08,220 --> 07:10:08,720
Oh.

5047
07:10:11,049 --> 07:10:12,409
You wouldn't hear this?

5048
07:10:12,409 --> 07:10:13,529
How do you not hear this?

5049
07:10:14,490 --> 07:10:16,659
I'm getting a reading of a strange creature.

5050
07:10:17,619 --> 07:10:18,580
I don't know what it could be.

5051
07:10:18,580 --> 07:10:20,419
It's possibly an organic compound.

5052
07:10:21,939 --> 07:10:23,459
Slowly.

5053
07:10:23,459 --> 07:10:26,020
Slowly breaking through the top of the ceiling.

5054
07:10:28,729 --> 07:10:29,610
I don't know what it could be.

5055
07:10:29,610 --> 07:10:31,529
It's possibly an organic compound.

5056
07:10:32,250 --> 07:10:34,700
What is that?

5057
07:10:34,700 --> 07:10:35,200
Oh.

5058
07:10:36,459 --> 07:10:46,860
Is there any other bone break?

5059
07:10:46,860 --> 07:10:47,500
I need a better-

5060
07:10:47,500 --> 07:10:48,380
A better bone break.

5061
07:10:58,619 --> 07:11:00,619
No, what was the one that I had in the bathtub?

5062
07:11:02,840 --> 07:11:04,360
Yeah, like glass smash.

5063
07:11:05,479 --> 07:11:06,279
Violent sounds.

5064
07:11:06,279 --> 07:11:07,240
No, not an ATM.

5065
07:11:11,049 --> 07:11:13,369
Glass, like, explosion.

5066
07:11:13,369 --> 07:11:14,250
Glass smash.

5067
07:11:19,659 --> 07:11:22,060
Your head is made out of, like, a little porcelain doll.

5068
07:11:22,060 --> 07:11:22,939
Is it gonna be a bigger one?

5069
07:11:27,540 --> 07:11:28,740
How is that violent?

5070
07:11:28,740 --> 07:11:30,419
You just dropped a teacup on the ground.

5071
07:11:34,540 --> 07:11:35,040
What is that?

5072
07:11:36,299 --> 07:11:37,580
That's a Christmas ornament.

5073
07:11:47,849 --> 07:11:49,770
Let me turn off the sound effects.

5074
07:11:52,200 --> 07:11:53,080
Let me put our own in.

5075
07:11:53,080 --> 07:12:06,360
I'm reading a strange creature up here.

5076
07:12:07,000 --> 07:12:07,959
I don't know what it could be.

5077
07:12:07,959 --> 07:12:09,720
It's possibly an organic compound.

5078
07:12:10,840 --> 07:12:12,200
It's a light bulb.

5079
07:12:12,200 --> 07:12:13,000
What is that?

5080
07:12:13,000 --> 07:12:13,500
Oh.

5081
07:12:14,200 --> 07:12:20,229
I think I'm gonna get rid of the camera

5082
07:12:21,639 --> 07:12:23,400
because this is just so anti-climactic.

5083
07:12:24,360 --> 07:12:29,060
What is that?

5084
07:12:29,060 --> 07:12:29,619
Oh.

5085
07:12:29,619 --> 07:12:34,680
No, I gotta get a better one.

5086
07:12:34,680 --> 07:12:36,099
Miscellaneous sounds.

5087
07:12:38,299 --> 07:12:40,619
Fire, lightning, lighting a match,

5088
07:12:40,619 --> 07:12:43,020
door open, dropping a tube, metal crack.

5089
07:12:45,180 --> 07:12:52,540
How about, um, I wish I could preview them.

5090
07:12:53,099 --> 07:12:54,139
That's too bad that you can't.

5091
07:12:56,500 --> 07:13:01,540
Door kick, hit mail, kung fu, mail, punch face, zombie hit.

5092
07:13:06,099 --> 07:13:07,220
Window smash.

5093
07:13:07,220 --> 07:13:07,779
Here we go.

5094
07:13:26,759 --> 07:13:27,880
It syncs pretty well.

5095
07:13:32,090 --> 07:13:36,919
Oh, people taking pictures of him?

5096
07:13:37,639 --> 07:13:39,990
Nah, I got a water right here.

5097
07:13:39,990 --> 07:13:40,490
I'm all right.

5098
07:13:45,500 --> 07:13:48,970
Gonna have the sound effects back on.

5099
07:13:48,970 --> 07:13:50,250
People laughing is good.

5100
07:13:51,689 --> 07:14:06,220
Oh, that's so loud.

5101
07:14:06,220 --> 07:14:06,700
I'm sorry.

5102
07:14:06,700 --> 07:14:07,500
It's really loud.

5103
07:14:07,500 --> 07:14:08,540
Let me turn it down.

5104
07:14:08,540 --> 07:14:18,220
Is that it?

5105
07:14:18,220 --> 07:14:19,419
I don't think I can turn it down.

5106
07:14:20,459 --> 07:14:20,959
Nope.

5107
07:14:26,259 --> 07:14:27,619
There needs to be a break, though.

5108
07:14:27,619 --> 07:14:29,540
Getting a reading of a strange creature up here.

5109
07:14:30,099 --> 07:14:31,220
I don't know what it could be.

5110
07:14:31,220 --> 07:14:32,900
Possibly an organic compound.

5111
07:14:32,900 --> 07:14:34,419
The laser is so loud, too.

5112
07:14:35,380 --> 07:14:36,180
What is that?

5113
07:14:36,180 --> 07:14:36,680
Oh.

5114
07:14:55,659 --> 07:15:01,419
It's like the T-Rex.

5115
07:15:02,139 --> 07:15:02,939
No T-Rex.

5116
07:15:05,849 --> 07:15:08,889
Okay, let's go over here.

5117
07:15:10,250 --> 07:15:12,819
What is that?

5118
07:15:12,819 --> 07:15:13,700
Like an eating noise?

5119
07:15:13,700 --> 07:15:15,540
Yeah, like crunch.

5120
07:15:16,340 --> 07:15:18,020
There's gotta be like a big crunch.

5121
07:15:25,500 --> 07:15:27,259
Weapon sounds, violent sounds.

5122
07:15:27,259 --> 07:15:29,580
Like it's not, I can't find anything.

5123
07:15:29,580 --> 07:15:30,810
Bullet body.

5124
07:15:32,419 --> 07:15:33,939
You think it would be bone break, but they're just like,

5125
07:15:37,139 --> 07:15:39,860
they're not, maybe crack knuckles is what it's gonna have to be.

5126
07:15:46,549 --> 07:15:51,430
I mean, that's very violent.

5127
07:15:52,389 --> 07:16:00,040
Okay, what the hell am I gonna do here?

5128
07:16:00,759 --> 07:16:04,470
What am I gonna do here?

5129
07:16:04,470 --> 07:16:06,069
Like squeaks when he's dancing?

5130
07:16:17,299 --> 07:16:18,900
Put Fortnite music in.

5131
07:16:20,069 --> 07:16:23,669
Oh, do not tell me to put in the Fortnite dance music.

5132
07:16:24,630 --> 07:16:25,130
No.

5133
07:16:25,750 --> 07:16:26,869
Oh my god.

5134
07:16:37,529 --> 07:16:38,029
Okay.

5135
07:16:38,729 --> 07:16:39,290
It's going in.

5136
07:16:39,930 --> 07:16:41,209
This guy, I gotta put it in here.

5137
07:16:41,209 --> 07:16:52,340
Where the hell am I gonna get like a wave of the Fortnite song?

5138
07:16:52,340 --> 07:16:54,500
Can I even get a wave of the Fortnite song?

5139
07:16:56,009 --> 07:16:56,810
There has to be somewhere.

5140
07:16:56,810 --> 07:16:58,490
That's the most popular game on Earth.

5141
07:17:00,790 --> 07:17:08,020
Default Fortnite song wave.

5142
07:17:09,939 --> 07:17:10,900
I mean, here it is.

5143
07:17:32,419 --> 07:17:34,099
Just record my phone?

5144
07:17:36,099 --> 07:17:38,259
Oh god damn it.

5145
07:17:38,259 --> 07:17:40,500
I can, all right, I can record my phone.

5146
07:17:40,500 --> 07:17:50,729
You're right.

5147
07:17:50,729 --> 07:17:52,169
Fortnite dance default.

5148
07:17:55,139 --> 07:17:57,220
That's a pretty, yeah, that's a pretty great loophole.

5149
07:17:57,220 --> 07:17:58,150
Here we go.

5150
07:18:05,189 --> 07:18:07,029
How loud can I make this though?

5151
07:18:07,029 --> 07:18:13,900
I can make it pretty loud.

5152
07:18:45,939 --> 07:18:48,569
It has to be louder than that.

5153
07:18:56,119 --> 07:18:59,159
I need to get a, let me get in a little closer.

5154
07:18:59,159 --> 07:19:00,119
You guys are gonna hate this.

5155
07:19:06,139 --> 07:19:07,900
I have to put this really close to the mic.

5156
07:19:13,849 --> 07:19:15,369
Okay, just, here it comes.

5157
07:19:15,930 --> 07:19:17,930
Just turn your volume down for a little bit.

5158
07:19:17,930 --> 07:19:22,279
Okay, here we go.

5159
07:19:23,000 --> 07:19:25,720
Turn your volume down.

5160
07:19:30,939 --> 07:19:45,380
Okay, how much worse does that sound?

5161
07:19:55,000 --> 07:19:56,200
It's gotta be moved a little.

5162
07:19:57,400 --> 07:20:07,029
All right, I'm gonna put it in again.

5163
07:20:50,860 --> 07:20:52,619
I don't like it, but I love it.

5164
07:20:53,259 --> 07:20:59,540
I don't think I even need anything else here.

5165
07:21:07,240 --> 07:21:08,520
It's so fucking loud.

5166
07:21:08,520 --> 07:21:09,799
I can't do anything about it, guys.

5167
07:21:14,099 --> 07:21:16,659
Okay, and then I need explosion, silent,

5168
07:21:16,659 --> 07:21:18,900
and then I need explosion sound here.

5169
07:21:25,290 --> 07:21:32,810
Explosion five.

5170
07:21:33,770 --> 07:21:36,330
This is, why is it so big?

5171
07:21:37,529 --> 07:21:46,680
Explosion one.

5172
07:21:52,099 --> 07:21:59,830
We're gonna change, we'll move the music around too,

5173
07:21:59,830 --> 07:22:00,549
don't worry.

5174
07:22:00,549 --> 07:22:03,909
I'll get to it, don't worry.

5175
07:22:06,200 --> 07:22:08,340
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

5176
07:22:08,340 --> 07:22:13,830
Oh, these are all like flames.

5177
07:22:13,830 --> 07:22:17,509
I need explosion, explosion, like violent, like boom.

5178
07:22:17,509 --> 07:22:28,340
Let's try, I don't know, cannon.

5179
07:22:28,340 --> 07:22:30,200
Let's try 10.

5180
07:22:30,840 --> 07:22:32,250
This one's quick.

5181
07:22:33,610 --> 07:22:35,450
Is that better?

5182
07:22:37,909 --> 07:22:39,580
Yeah, that's fine.

5183
07:22:44,979 --> 07:22:46,099
And car drive sounds.

5184
07:22:59,400 --> 07:23:13,819
Okay, it works.

5185
07:23:13,819 --> 07:23:15,400
Now what the hell should I put here?

5186
07:23:16,040 --> 07:23:27,400
Okay, here we go.

5187
07:23:35,380 --> 07:23:36,659
Shit, don't touch me.

5188
07:23:37,299 --> 07:23:39,540
I'm not gonna be part of your experiments anymore.

5189
07:23:42,090 --> 07:23:53,159
Don't touch me.

5190
07:23:53,159 --> 07:23:55,930
I'm not gonna be part of your experiments anymore.

5191
07:23:58,630 --> 07:24:05,799
All right, I need like a crash here.

5192
07:24:25,689 --> 07:24:27,209
Hold on, wait, wait, wait.

5193
07:24:27,209 --> 07:24:30,709
I gotta, it's when he hits the ground.

5194
07:25:05,369 --> 07:25:15,029
I wish I could just get it to cut off.

5195
07:25:24,919 --> 07:25:27,639
I have to put in like, oh, oh, oh.

5196
07:26:07,459 --> 07:26:12,340
All right, why is this, why is this like George Takei?

5197
07:26:17,779 --> 07:26:28,810
No, I just want like a axe hitting flesh.

5198
07:26:30,869 --> 07:26:35,159
Don't touch me, I'm not gonna be part of your experiments.

5199
07:26:35,159 --> 07:26:40,740
One of these should be way louder.

5200
07:26:40,740 --> 07:26:41,380
Zombie hit?

5201
07:26:41,380 --> 07:26:46,259
I'm not gonna be part of your experiments anymore.

5202
07:26:49,220 --> 07:27:12,180
Okay, we need like a scream here.

5203
07:27:12,180 --> 07:27:16,779
How about, um, sniff?

5204
07:27:19,619 --> 07:27:22,630
No, it's not time for that.

5205
07:27:22,630 --> 07:27:26,119
I will try it in one spot.

5206
07:27:26,119 --> 07:27:36,939
I will try it right here and that's it.

5207
07:27:36,939 --> 07:27:37,419
Where is it?

5208
07:27:40,419 --> 07:27:51,509
You're gonna get this once.

5209
07:27:51,509 --> 07:27:53,909
I'm not gonna be part of your experiments anymore.

5210
07:27:53,909 --> 07:27:54,790
You can't even hear it.

5211
07:28:31,849 --> 07:28:33,369
It's as long as this cut is.

5212
07:28:44,090 --> 07:28:49,180
It's not going in.

5213
07:29:03,689 --> 07:29:04,490
It's out of place.

5214
07:29:04,490 --> 07:29:05,450
The scream is better.

5215
07:29:09,659 --> 07:29:10,220
That's better.

5216
07:29:23,020 --> 07:29:25,259
There is no, I don't know what's happening.

5217
07:29:29,400 --> 07:29:31,000
This needs something else to close this out with.

5218
07:30:14,790 --> 07:30:16,310
Yeah, I gotta change the font here.

5219
07:30:16,950 --> 07:30:28,470
Where's the, oh, there we go.

5220
07:30:28,470 --> 07:30:29,590
That's a pretty good gamer font.

5221
07:30:46,459 --> 07:30:50,380
You don't even know like why,

5222
07:30:50,380 --> 07:30:52,139
I don't even know why he falls off this horse.

5223
07:31:00,360 --> 07:31:24,599
Who even fires a gun to make him fire himself off?

5224
07:31:24,599 --> 07:31:27,020
That's not happening.

5225
07:31:27,020 --> 07:31:32,340
The weapon sounds, I need something better than that.

5226
07:31:32,340 --> 07:31:33,299
Gun shotgun.

5227
07:31:34,360 --> 07:31:35,560
Gun cock shotgun.

5228
07:31:36,119 --> 07:31:59,770
This is better maybe?

5229
07:32:00,409 --> 07:32:01,450
Okay, that's better.

5230
07:32:14,900 --> 07:32:16,500
I need a landing sound too.

5231
07:32:32,419 --> 07:32:35,029
It's the wind knocked out of him.

5232
07:32:35,830 --> 07:32:50,069
All right, fade it out.

5233
07:32:50,069 --> 07:32:51,830
Fade out, fade in.

5234
07:33:02,729 --> 07:33:04,169
Don't worry, I'll fix the music.

5235
07:33:04,169 --> 07:33:06,180
I will get the music all fixed.

5236
07:33:06,180 --> 07:33:07,380
We gotta have some claps here.

5237
07:33:08,099 --> 07:33:24,659
Here comes the next premiere.

5238
07:33:25,220 --> 07:34:00,389
This one's even worse.

5239
07:34:00,389 --> 07:34:27,740
Oh, come on.

5240
07:34:27,740 --> 07:34:29,180
Wait till the N64 filter.

5241
07:34:29,180 --> 07:34:31,819
We will put this through in six months.

5242
07:34:32,700 --> 07:34:35,319
I'm a boomer.

5243
07:34:35,319 --> 07:34:35,799
What do you mean?

5244
07:34:44,939 --> 07:34:46,860
Pre-tech out concept.

5245
07:34:48,069 --> 07:34:49,189
World premiere.

5246
07:34:49,189 --> 07:34:53,240
This doesn't even have a title.

5247
07:34:53,240 --> 07:34:54,520
This is a pre-concept.

5248
07:35:29,770 --> 07:35:31,049
Come on, no.

5249
07:35:33,159 --> 07:35:59,000
Take it from Montdale High School Science Program.

5250
07:35:59,000 --> 07:36:01,139
Why would they need to use that?

5251
07:36:01,139 --> 07:36:03,700
Pre-concept footage used from high school students.

5252
07:36:08,979 --> 07:36:10,099
Yeah, like a different something.

5253
07:36:10,099 --> 07:36:11,779
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5254
07:36:11,779 --> 07:36:13,299
I can make this shorter.

5255
07:36:13,299 --> 07:36:40,090
Why can I not make this capital?

5256
07:36:52,790 --> 07:37:05,209
Okay, there we go.

5257
07:37:23,400 --> 07:37:32,500
Is he still wrong?

5258
07:37:32,500 --> 07:37:33,220
I don't care.

5259
07:37:33,939 --> 07:37:44,680
What a terrible pre-concept.

5260
07:37:45,479 --> 07:37:51,080
This is made by high schoolers.

5261
07:37:51,080 --> 07:37:53,560
So it has to have a bunch of fucking dumb noises in it.

5262
07:38:05,619 --> 07:38:06,659
Okay, let me go back.

5263
07:38:07,299 --> 07:38:09,060
And we gotta fix some of the music here.

5264
07:38:09,060 --> 07:38:26,150
What are you gonna do about it?

5265
07:38:26,150 --> 07:38:27,590
I gotta do a better world premiere than that.

5266
07:38:39,560 --> 07:38:40,200
Don't die on me.

5267
07:38:50,040 --> 07:38:50,759
Fuck!

5268
07:38:50,759 --> 07:38:52,619
How do I get rid of it?

5269
07:38:52,619 --> 07:38:55,419
How do I get rid of it?

5270
07:38:55,419 --> 07:38:56,619
How do I get rid of it?

5271
07:38:56,619 --> 07:38:58,299
How do I get rid of it?

5272
07:38:58,299 --> 07:38:59,340
I can't get rid of it.

5273
07:39:02,979 --> 07:39:04,659
He's George Lucas-ing.

5274
07:39:04,659 --> 07:39:06,259
He's, I'm George Lucas-ing.

5275
07:39:06,259 --> 07:39:07,540
You're right, I can't do that.

5276
07:39:11,880 --> 07:39:13,959
That's the most upset I've been in a long time.

5277
07:39:13,959 --> 07:39:15,319
About something that I did.

5278
07:39:15,319 --> 07:39:26,229
Sorry, I got it right here.

5279
07:39:26,229 --> 07:39:27,740
There it is, 19.

5280
07:39:28,630 --> 07:39:29,130
Right?

5281
07:39:31,720 --> 07:39:32,200
Which one is it?

5282
07:39:32,200 --> 07:39:34,650
Dialogue 27.

5283
07:39:40,250 --> 07:39:41,770
Dialogue 27, find it.

5284
07:39:44,250 --> 07:39:51,669
I see it.

5285
07:39:51,669 --> 07:39:53,509
16, where the fuck is it?

5286
07:39:53,509 --> 07:39:59,189
It's right here.

5287
07:39:59,189 --> 07:40:00,869
Dialogue 19, 27.

5288
07:40:00,869 --> 07:40:10,599
Which one am I gonna touch?

5289
07:40:10,599 --> 07:40:14,470
No, not the right one.

5290
07:40:14,470 --> 07:40:16,220
Not the right one.

5291
07:40:16,220 --> 07:40:17,560
I got it.

5292
07:40:17,560 --> 07:40:18,599
It's selected, right?

5293
07:40:18,599 --> 07:40:19,720
That's selected, isn't it?

5294
07:40:19,720 --> 07:40:21,319
If I hit delete, that's selected.

5295
07:40:21,319 --> 07:40:26,700
Dialogue 27 is selected right now.

5296
07:40:26,700 --> 07:40:27,819
Please confirm.

5297
07:40:27,819 --> 07:40:38,709
Did it.

5298
07:40:38,709 --> 07:40:39,349
I got it.

5299
07:40:39,349 --> 07:40:45,900
World premiere.

5300
07:40:45,900 --> 07:40:49,979
Got it.

5301
07:40:49,979 --> 07:40:51,259
Okay, no more George Lucas-ing.

5302
07:40:51,259 --> 07:40:53,020
I need to do music though.

5303
07:40:53,020 --> 07:40:54,169
So right here.

5304
07:40:55,290 --> 07:40:55,790
Oh!

5305
07:40:57,819 --> 07:40:58,319
No!

5306
07:41:01,060 --> 07:41:03,240
Okay, now we're gonna make the music.

5307
07:41:05,720 --> 07:41:10,500
Let's see.

5308
07:41:10,500 --> 07:41:12,520
Action.

5309
07:41:12,520 --> 07:41:13,319
Chrome virus.

5310
07:41:18,950 --> 07:41:20,310
Moonlight romance.

5311
07:41:20,310 --> 07:41:21,500
Fool about.

5312
07:41:21,500 --> 07:41:22,470
Creepy crawly.

5313
07:41:27,459 --> 07:41:29,139
I'm getting a reading of a strange creature.

5314
07:41:30,340 --> 07:41:31,860
That scared the shit out of me.

5315
07:41:31,860 --> 07:41:32,900
Organic compound.

5316
07:41:35,299 --> 07:41:36,099
What is that?

5317
07:41:36,099 --> 07:41:36,599
Oh.

5318
07:41:40,599 --> 07:42:03,290
I can't.

5319
07:42:03,290 --> 07:42:03,689
Whoa!

5320
07:42:03,689 --> 07:42:04,330
Look at what I'm doing.

5321
07:42:04,330 --> 07:42:05,049
Look at what I'm...

5322
07:42:05,049 --> 07:42:06,330
Holy shit, look what I did.

5323
07:42:06,330 --> 07:42:11,340
But how do I...

5324
07:42:16,740 --> 07:42:18,099
No, stop.

5325
07:42:18,099 --> 07:42:20,360
I just have to have fanfare happen.

5326
07:42:37,659 --> 07:42:38,459
Shit.

5327
07:42:38,459 --> 07:42:46,250
That's a remix.

5328
07:42:46,889 --> 07:42:50,259
Turn this down.

5329
07:42:56,340 --> 07:43:06,490
It's not even like in the right spot now.

5330
07:43:06,490 --> 07:43:07,209
Wait, hold on.

5331
07:43:26,580 --> 07:43:27,860
Jesus Christ!

5332
07:43:40,840 --> 07:43:53,979
It scared me again.

5333
07:43:54,939 --> 07:43:55,900
It scared me again.

5334
07:44:15,270 --> 07:44:16,419
All right, now we need...

5335
07:44:17,220 --> 07:44:19,540
We need like a crazier song here.

5336
07:44:25,110 --> 07:44:25,750
Armageddon.

5337
07:44:33,049 --> 07:44:34,409
Dr. Moore's Evil Lab.

5338
07:44:34,409 --> 07:44:36,009
Let's see what this sounds like.

5339
07:44:44,549 --> 07:44:46,310
No, we gotta have like more action than that.

5340
07:44:48,939 --> 07:44:49,580
Acid Base?

5341
07:44:50,299 --> 07:44:55,130
I don't think Acid Base is not long enough for this.

5342
07:44:58,950 --> 07:45:01,110
What is going on with this fanfare one?

5343
07:45:01,110 --> 07:45:06,599
It's gonna be loud.

5344
07:45:26,840 --> 07:45:47,909
This is a fuck...

5345
07:45:47,909 --> 07:45:50,069
This is an absolute mess.

5346
07:45:51,049 --> 07:45:52,330
This app doesn't...

5347
07:45:52,330 --> 07:45:54,409
I don't even know if I can salvage this last part.

5348
07:45:58,939 --> 07:45:59,740
Fresh sneakers.

5349
07:46:16,250 --> 07:46:16,729
Not bad.

5350
07:46:50,840 --> 07:46:52,279
You need laughs.

5351
07:46:52,279 --> 07:47:07,909
Hold on.

5352
07:47:07,909 --> 07:47:08,310
I can...

5353
07:47:08,310 --> 07:47:12,919
I need a laugh track.

5354
07:47:12,919 --> 07:47:13,799
Because this is you guys...

5355
07:47:13,799 --> 07:47:14,119
You guys...

5356
07:47:14,119 --> 07:47:17,779
This is you guys laughing at the E3 conference.

5357
07:47:17,779 --> 07:47:22,759
I know exactly where I can get a laugh track with my telephone.

5358
07:47:43,110 --> 07:47:53,290
This one's probably better.

5359
07:47:53,290 --> 07:48:22,819
Now lower your volume.

5360
07:48:22,819 --> 07:48:26,259
Let us do the laugh track in the Discord server.

5361
07:48:26,419 --> 07:48:26,659
No.

5362
07:48:36,250 --> 07:48:37,689
You can barely hear it.

5363
07:48:38,490 --> 07:48:38,970
It's like a...

5364
07:48:39,770 --> 07:48:43,450
It's like you're outside of E3 and you can hear this.

5365
07:48:44,250 --> 07:48:54,360
They laugh when the door opens.

5366
07:49:02,380 --> 07:49:03,659
Why is that so funny?

5367
07:49:04,619 --> 07:49:05,979
Just loop them into the...

5368
07:49:08,700 --> 07:49:10,700
Just stack them on top of each other.

5369
07:49:10,700 --> 07:49:15,580
And this is just stupid enough to work.

5370
07:49:16,139 --> 07:49:46,139
I can't tell if this is working or just a waste of time.

5371
07:49:46,139 --> 07:49:58,729
I think it's working.

5372
07:50:27,849 --> 07:50:28,970
Only one.

5373
07:50:29,770 --> 07:50:34,299
It's Doom Eternal.

5374
07:50:34,299 --> 07:50:38,939
Uh-oh.

5375
07:50:38,939 --> 07:50:39,419
Uh-oh.

5376
07:50:42,779 --> 07:50:43,259
Uh-oh.

5377
07:50:44,139 --> 07:50:48,389
I saved it, right?

5378
07:50:48,389 --> 07:50:49,430
Saved it like...

5379
07:50:49,430 --> 07:50:50,630
I saved it pretty good.

5380
07:50:50,630 --> 07:50:51,189
I got it.

5381
07:50:51,189 --> 07:50:51,669
I saved it.

5382
07:50:53,799 --> 07:50:54,360
It's crashed.

5383
07:50:55,000 --> 07:50:58,009
Too many looping Doom Eternals.

5384
07:50:58,889 --> 07:51:01,849
I saved it like less than five, ten minutes ago.

5385
07:51:04,889 --> 07:51:08,150
We didn't have very much shit.

5386
07:51:13,639 --> 07:51:20,790
It's all right.

5387
07:51:20,790 --> 07:51:22,150
When I deleted world premiere.

5388
07:51:22,869 --> 07:51:24,360
Yeah.

5389
07:51:24,360 --> 07:51:24,919
What else?

5390
07:51:24,919 --> 07:51:25,959
I didn't do anything else.

5391
07:51:25,959 --> 07:51:27,560
It wasn't that long ago.

5392
07:51:28,040 --> 07:51:32,139
Yeah, just the music.

5393
07:51:32,779 --> 07:51:42,389
But it's just Creepy Crawler, Acid Base, and Fresh Sneakers.

5394
07:51:45,669 --> 07:51:47,110
I think this is hard locked.

5395
07:51:53,049 --> 07:51:53,849
I can't close it.

5396
07:51:58,700 --> 07:51:59,259
What the hell?

5397
07:52:01,419 --> 07:52:01,919
Uh-oh.

5398
07:52:03,500 --> 07:52:04,380
Hold on.

5399
07:52:04,380 --> 07:52:04,860
Let me just...

5400
07:52:04,860 --> 07:52:06,540
I have to get my task manager open.

5401
07:52:11,849 --> 07:52:12,169
Shit.

5402
07:52:14,229 --> 07:52:14,470
No!

5403
07:52:16,599 --> 07:52:18,360
No, I can't even end the task.

5404
07:52:21,659 --> 07:52:22,700
Come on, please.

5405
07:52:27,819 --> 07:52:29,020
No, it's not over.

5406
07:52:29,020 --> 07:52:31,740
We're so close to being able to be done and watch it.

5407
07:52:31,740 --> 07:52:34,439
This is like four hours in the making.

5408
07:52:34,439 --> 07:52:44,099
I ain't going.

5409
07:52:44,099 --> 07:52:45,860
Let me see if I can pull it from here.

5410
07:52:48,259 --> 07:52:49,299
I can't get it.

5411
07:52:49,299 --> 07:52:53,500
I'm trying to alt tab and hit task manager with alt tab.

5412
07:52:53,500 --> 07:52:54,860
But it's going to my...

5413
07:52:54,860 --> 07:52:56,060
It's still behind.

5414
07:52:56,060 --> 07:52:56,939
It's on my other window.

5415
07:52:56,939 --> 07:52:57,259
It's...

5416
07:52:57,259 --> 07:52:58,060
Oh, shit.

5417
07:52:58,700 --> 07:53:01,909
Come on.

5418
07:53:02,650 --> 07:53:03,049
Delete.

5419
07:53:04,020 --> 07:53:04,500
Come on.

5420
07:53:06,169 --> 07:53:07,770
Don't be completely hard locked here.

5421
07:53:09,139 --> 07:53:09,619
Please.

5422
07:53:12,389 --> 07:53:13,909
Yeah, that did it.

5423
07:53:13,909 --> 07:53:16,709
Task manager, alt tab to see it and then use the arrow keys and then...

5424
07:53:17,430 --> 07:53:19,110
Yeah, that's what I'm doing right now.

5425
07:53:19,110 --> 07:53:19,509
Delete.

5426
07:53:20,229 --> 07:53:22,490
I got the mouse.

5427
07:53:22,490 --> 07:53:23,209
I can click the X.

5428
07:53:23,209 --> 07:53:24,169
It's just not doing anything.

5429
07:53:35,479 --> 07:53:36,919
Because I can close the other ones.

5430
07:53:37,560 --> 07:53:42,939
Windows tab and make a new window in the top left.

5431
07:53:43,580 --> 07:53:49,639
Is there anybody that I can open the task manager to my other monitors?

5432
07:53:50,200 --> 07:53:55,880
You know what I'm saying?

5433
07:53:56,520 --> 07:54:00,310
How do I do that?

5434
07:54:02,409 --> 07:54:03,849
Windows key plus tab.

5435
07:54:04,409 --> 07:54:07,270
Okay.

5436
07:54:07,830 --> 07:54:19,750
Okay, I got the task manager open, but I just can't use it.

5437
07:54:19,750 --> 07:54:25,990
Task manager.

5438
07:54:25,990 --> 07:54:28,150
Ah, it looked like it was going to do it for a second.

5439
07:54:28,150 --> 07:54:41,580
I can't like drag it.

5440
07:54:41,580 --> 07:54:46,619
Always on top task manager.

5441
07:54:46,619 --> 07:54:50,090
I don't know why mine's not up there like that.

5442
07:54:50,090 --> 07:54:51,450
Windows key and left arrow.

5443
07:54:56,119 --> 07:54:56,919
New desktop.

5444
07:54:59,770 --> 07:55:04,040
New desktop.

5445
07:55:04,040 --> 07:55:05,400
Wait, desktop one.

5446
07:55:06,409 --> 07:55:07,610
What the hell did I just do?

5447
07:55:08,330 --> 07:55:11,990
Hello?

5448
07:55:12,729 --> 07:55:15,349
I don't see anybody.

5449
07:55:15,349 --> 07:55:19,319
I'm on a new desktop.

5450
07:55:19,319 --> 07:55:20,840
I have no OBS.

5451
07:55:20,840 --> 07:55:21,240
I have...

5452
07:55:21,240 --> 07:55:26,090
What happened?

5453
07:55:26,090 --> 07:55:28,700
No, I was just in...

5454
07:55:28,700 --> 07:55:33,909
I was just there.

5455
07:55:33,909 --> 07:55:34,630
All right, I'm back.

5456
07:55:34,630 --> 07:55:34,869
I'm back.

5457
07:55:34,869 --> 07:55:35,270
I'm back.

5458
07:55:35,270 --> 07:55:36,389
So I did new desktop.

5459
07:55:36,389 --> 07:55:38,709
I tried to open task manager on the new desktop and I can't...

5460
07:55:38,709 --> 07:55:44,889
I couldn't do it because I'm new desktop.

5461
07:55:44,889 --> 07:55:52,009
Task manager in the new desktop.

5462
07:55:52,009 --> 07:55:52,490
I'm here.

5463
07:55:52,490 --> 07:55:52,889
I'm here.

5464
07:55:53,450 --> 07:55:53,849
I'm here.

5465
07:55:58,500 --> 07:56:08,180
The first task manager is currently closed.

5466
07:56:08,180 --> 07:56:10,020
Right click on the bottom bar and new desktop.

5467
07:56:10,020 --> 07:56:11,540
Click task manager.

5468
07:56:11,540 --> 07:56:13,029
All right, I'm going to try it again.

5469
07:56:13,029 --> 07:56:14,840
Wish me luck.

5470
07:56:14,840 --> 07:56:15,560
New desktop.

5471
07:56:16,810 --> 07:56:17,130
Okay.

5472
07:56:17,689 --> 07:56:21,540
I'm trying...

5473
07:56:21,540 --> 07:56:23,380
Okay, task manager.

5474
07:56:24,259 --> 07:56:24,740
I got it.

5475
07:56:25,299 --> 07:56:29,319
You guys are so smart.

5476
07:56:34,700 --> 07:56:35,659
End task.

5477
07:56:35,659 --> 07:56:36,220
Got it.

5478
07:56:36,220 --> 07:56:36,700
We're good.

5479
07:56:38,580 --> 07:56:40,340
You guys are seriously fucking so smart.

5480
07:56:42,740 --> 07:56:43,139
We're back.

5481
07:56:44,250 --> 07:56:45,770
All right, let's open it back up.

5482
07:56:45,770 --> 07:56:50,069
What would I do without you guys?

5483
07:56:51,270 --> 07:56:52,069
I don't know.

5484
07:56:52,069 --> 07:56:54,040
What would I do without you?

5485
07:56:54,520 --> 07:57:01,909
I'm...

5486
07:57:01,909 --> 07:57:02,869
We're getting to the end of this.

5487
07:57:02,869 --> 07:57:04,310
I'm finishing this tonight.

5488
07:57:04,310 --> 07:57:05,819
Because I'm not streaming tomorrow.

5489
07:57:11,130 --> 07:57:11,529
Let's go.

5490
07:57:12,090 --> 07:57:16,869
Uh-oh.

5491
07:57:16,869 --> 07:57:22,680
The movie stunts and effects was not closed properly the last time you used it.

5492
07:57:22,680 --> 07:57:30,819
If it fails to run, you can look for a solution in the readme file.

5493
07:57:30,819 --> 07:57:31,299
Uh-oh.

5494
07:57:35,130 --> 07:57:35,529
Okay.

5495
07:57:40,310 --> 07:57:40,869
Please open.

5496
07:57:41,430 --> 07:57:43,590
It opened.

5497
07:57:43,590 --> 07:57:46,819
Can you see it?

5498
07:57:50,340 --> 07:57:51,139
Back in action.

5499
07:57:51,139 --> 07:57:52,020
It's gonna be really loud.

5500
07:57:52,020 --> 07:57:53,060
Turn your volume down.

5501
07:57:53,060 --> 07:57:54,180
There's nothing I can do about it.

5502
07:57:54,180 --> 07:57:55,220
Turn your volume down now.

5503
07:57:55,220 --> 07:58:03,590
The menu here is 10 times louder than the game.

5504
07:58:03,590 --> 07:58:03,990
Warning.

5505
07:58:04,709 --> 07:58:06,229
Oh, this isn't even that bad.

5506
07:58:06,229 --> 07:58:06,950
Okay, game.

5507
07:58:08,139 --> 07:58:08,939
Load game.

5508
07:58:11,880 --> 07:58:13,479
We were here, right?

5509
07:58:14,200 --> 07:58:15,400
2130...

5510
07:58:15,400 --> 07:58:15,720
Wait, what?

5511
07:58:15,720 --> 07:58:16,520
Pee Pants 2.

5512
07:58:17,319 --> 07:58:21,049
Yeah, it's this one here.

5513
07:58:21,689 --> 07:58:25,669
My ear...

5514
07:58:25,669 --> 07:58:25,909
I thought...

5515
07:58:25,909 --> 07:58:27,110
I really thought it was gonna be really loud.

5516
07:58:27,830 --> 07:58:28,389
Usually is.

5517
07:58:31,400 --> 07:58:32,439
Auto save or pee...

5518
07:58:32,439 --> 07:58:33,240
No, Pee Pants 2.

5519
07:58:35,909 --> 07:58:37,830
You'll have to save this game in 2001.

5520
07:58:38,630 --> 07:58:39,029
I know.

5521
07:58:39,590 --> 07:58:44,659
Here we go.

5522
07:58:58,680 --> 07:58:59,240
Um, wait.

5523
07:59:00,360 --> 07:59:00,599
What?

5524
07:59:03,400 --> 07:59:03,880
Wait a minute.

5525
07:59:07,590 --> 07:59:08,310
No, no, no.

5526
07:59:08,869 --> 07:59:10,310
I saved it.

5527
07:59:11,540 --> 07:59:13,459
I saved like making the video.

5528
07:59:13,459 --> 07:59:14,099
Making the movie.

5529
07:59:14,819 --> 07:59:18,680
I think I have to be like in the post-production menu, probably?

5530
07:59:20,819 --> 07:59:21,139
Yeah.

5531
07:59:25,209 --> 07:59:26,169
Just go into the movie.

5532
07:59:26,169 --> 07:59:26,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5533
07:59:26,650 --> 07:59:27,529
We just gotta...

5534
07:59:27,529 --> 07:59:28,970
We just gotta go into um...

5535
07:59:29,770 --> 07:59:30,250
Into where?

5536
07:59:33,880 --> 07:59:34,919
Can I get there from here?

5537
07:59:40,279 --> 07:59:41,560
Post-production.

5538
07:59:41,560 --> 07:59:42,520
Should I just drag it in there?

5539
07:59:47,500 --> 07:59:48,619
Pee 3 cancel.

5540
07:59:48,619 --> 07:59:49,500
What is the point?

5541
07:59:49,500 --> 07:59:51,020
I just gotta get into post-production, right?

5542
07:59:55,500 --> 07:59:57,419
I am so scared to just hit shoot this.

5543
08:00:02,939 --> 08:00:03,259
No.

5544
08:00:03,979 --> 08:00:04,299
No.

5545
08:00:04,299 --> 08:00:05,740
I was very clear.

5546
08:00:15,610 --> 08:00:16,490
It has to be saved.

5547
08:00:16,490 --> 08:00:18,490
Yeah, I mean why would they have a save feature there?

5548
08:00:26,520 --> 08:00:27,240
Well, it's...

5549
08:00:30,470 --> 08:00:31,110
Load game.

5550
08:00:36,409 --> 08:00:36,650
No.

5551
08:00:37,209 --> 08:00:42,229
The autosave?

5552
08:00:42,229 --> 08:00:42,470
No.

5553
08:00:43,110 --> 08:00:45,750
This is like the save file.

5554
08:00:45,750 --> 08:00:50,470
The file should be in the game folder.

5555
08:00:50,470 --> 08:00:51,349
Yeah, let me just...

5556
08:00:51,349 --> 08:00:51,909
Let me just...

5557
08:00:52,790 --> 08:00:56,819
Let me just get into like the editor and try to open it.

5558
08:01:00,200 --> 08:01:04,069
Let me like just shoot this and then get into the editor.

5559
08:01:04,069 --> 08:01:09,349
That's very sad if that's the case.

5560
08:01:11,540 --> 08:01:13,860
Just get it into post-production and then open up from there.

5561
08:01:14,580 --> 08:01:15,819
It has to be there.

5562
08:01:16,380 --> 08:01:29,700
Do not override it.

5563
08:01:33,159 --> 08:01:35,319
Yeah, just bring it to post, right?

5564
08:01:39,500 --> 08:01:39,819
Before...

5565
08:01:39,819 --> 08:01:40,380
Let me just...

5566
08:01:40,380 --> 08:01:41,259
Hold on just a second.

5567
08:01:41,259 --> 08:01:42,139
Let me do something here.

5568
08:01:43,159 --> 08:01:46,759
I'm gonna go into the save files and just like copy the one that's there right now.

5569
08:01:52,500 --> 08:01:53,220
Hold on a second.

5570
08:01:53,779 --> 08:01:57,430
Where would that be?

5571
08:01:58,229 --> 08:02:02,389
Like just in case it overwrites it or something.

5572
08:02:04,169 --> 08:02:04,810
Let's go to...

5573
08:02:05,610 --> 08:02:06,810
It's in my documents, right?

5574
08:02:07,610 --> 08:02:17,939
Movies.

5575
08:02:18,819 --> 08:02:19,380
Movies.

5576
08:02:20,580 --> 08:02:22,740
E3 presentation is in here.

5577
08:02:25,220 --> 08:02:25,700
I see it.

5578
08:02:35,740 --> 08:02:39,900
It was modified at 1139 p.m.

5579
08:02:43,080 --> 08:02:44,599
It's a configuration file.

5580
08:02:45,159 --> 08:02:49,819
I'm going to copy both of these.

5581
08:02:50,540 --> 08:02:56,549
There's E3 presentation and E3presentation.trl.

5582
08:02:57,110 --> 08:03:00,490
And I'm gonna just paste them over here.

5583
08:03:00,490 --> 08:03:01,770
I'm just gonna have them.

5584
08:03:01,770 --> 08:03:08,310
There's also a couple of these.

5585
08:03:08,310 --> 08:03:10,630
I'm just gonna copy these as well just in case something horrible happens.

5586
08:03:11,270 --> 08:03:14,729
And then I get...

5587
08:03:14,729 --> 08:03:16,009
I see get out of town here as well.

5588
08:03:16,009 --> 08:03:16,330
All right.

5589
08:03:16,330 --> 08:03:18,729
E3 presentation, configuration, movies.

5590
08:03:18,729 --> 08:03:19,770
Let me just check the other ones.

5591
08:03:20,650 --> 08:03:21,849
Movie sounds.

5592
08:03:21,849 --> 08:03:22,650
They're still in there.

5593
08:03:24,810 --> 08:03:25,610
Saved games.

5594
08:03:27,290 --> 08:03:28,009
Okay.

5595
08:03:28,009 --> 08:03:30,729
But these are saved games and not configuration files.

5596
08:03:32,180 --> 08:03:35,220
I have my E3 presentation config file here.

5597
08:03:35,939 --> 08:03:41,159
Cross your fingers.

5598
08:03:41,159 --> 08:03:44,310
Because we're gonna just...

5599
08:03:44,310 --> 08:03:45,349
I'm gonna put it into post-production.

5600
08:03:45,349 --> 08:03:48,549
See what happens.

5601
08:03:48,549 --> 08:03:49,189
I got the...

5602
08:03:49,189 --> 08:03:49,990
Everything's backed up.

5603
08:03:50,549 --> 08:03:54,229
Let's try to...

5604
08:03:54,229 --> 08:03:55,430
Let's see what happens.

5605
08:03:55,430 --> 08:04:06,779
Can you go into post-production from the main menu?

5606
08:04:06,779 --> 08:04:07,419
I don't think you can.

5607
08:04:09,590 --> 08:04:10,569
Here we go.

5608
08:04:17,639 --> 08:04:19,639
Here we go.

5609
08:04:44,470 --> 08:04:45,029
That's not...

5610
08:04:45,029 --> 08:04:45,349
I can't...

5611
08:04:45,990 --> 08:04:46,470
Wait.

5612
08:04:46,470 --> 08:04:47,909
Whoa, wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

5613
08:04:48,549 --> 08:04:50,069
It's here, it's here, it's here, it's here, it's here, it's here, it's here.

5614
08:04:50,069 --> 08:04:50,389
It's here.

5615
08:04:50,389 --> 08:04:51,110
This is it.

5616
08:04:51,110 --> 08:04:54,900
It's here.

5617
08:04:54,900 --> 08:04:55,299
It's fine.

5618
08:04:55,299 --> 08:04:56,099
Everything's done.

5619
08:04:56,099 --> 08:04:58,840
The whole item was just...

5620
08:04:58,840 --> 08:05:00,919
Item was died.

5621
08:05:00,919 --> 08:05:07,529
For a second, I was so depressed because I thought that was load.

5622
08:05:07,529 --> 08:05:07,849
Okay.

5623
08:05:07,849 --> 08:05:08,970
So where do we leave off?

5624
08:05:18,340 --> 08:05:19,540
Something's not right.

5625
08:05:19,540 --> 08:05:25,860
Something's not right, guys.

5626
08:05:29,020 --> 08:05:31,000
These are off somehow.

5627
08:05:31,000 --> 08:05:44,169
I think the cuts are all gone.

5628
08:05:44,169 --> 08:05:56,919
Are they all gone?

5629
08:05:56,919 --> 08:05:57,880
No, they're not.

5630
08:05:57,880 --> 08:05:58,759
Are they?

5631
08:05:58,759 --> 08:06:01,659
Yeah, they are.

5632
08:06:01,659 --> 08:06:02,939
All the edits are gone.

5633
08:06:02,939 --> 08:06:09,459
Because this was not over here.

5634
08:06:09,459 --> 08:06:16,419
This is gonna screw up everything.

5635
08:06:16,979 --> 08:06:19,459
Because I have to edit it again.

5636
08:06:22,009 --> 08:06:31,380
If it was saved, though, why wouldn't I be able to pull it from here?

5637
08:06:31,380 --> 08:06:32,819
I lost a half an hour of progress?

5638
08:06:33,380 --> 08:06:34,580
Nah, but this...

5639
08:06:36,220 --> 08:06:38,380
Some of these clips, especially like this one here...

5640
08:06:39,180 --> 08:06:39,979
Like, see, look at this.

5641
08:06:39,979 --> 08:06:40,380
This was...

5642
08:06:40,939 --> 08:06:41,979
I put these over there.

5643
08:06:41,979 --> 08:06:43,099
I did this the first thing I did.

5644
08:06:48,459 --> 08:06:50,380
Go to main menu and post-production.

5645
08:06:50,380 --> 08:06:50,860
I'll try it.

5646
08:06:51,819 --> 08:06:52,459
Main menu?

5647
08:06:53,180 --> 08:06:58,439
Can I get that from the main menu?

5648
08:07:00,599 --> 08:07:02,200
I can't load it from here, unfortunately.

5649
08:07:02,200 --> 08:07:02,919
It's just pulling it.

5650
08:07:03,639 --> 08:07:07,740
The audio is here, but I'm gonna edit this and it's gonna get screwed up.

5651
08:07:12,599 --> 08:07:13,400
Is there a way...

5652
08:07:14,119 --> 08:07:17,849
Let's just see.

5653
08:07:17,849 --> 08:07:18,729
Hold on, just get out.

5654
08:07:20,009 --> 08:07:20,569
Main menu.

5655
08:07:21,689 --> 08:07:22,409
See if I can...

5656
08:07:22,409 --> 08:07:23,610
No, don't save the current game.

5657
08:07:25,799 --> 08:07:26,599
Movie player?

5658
08:07:47,830 --> 08:07:48,950
No, the cuts aren't here.

5659
08:07:55,610 --> 08:07:56,810
Maybe I can't reshoot it.

5660
08:07:58,860 --> 08:07:59,900
Let's do this then.

5661
08:07:59,900 --> 08:08:01,020
I'm gonna reload my save.

5662
08:08:08,229 --> 08:08:09,990
Nah, those are the only config files that are in there.

5663
08:08:15,720 --> 08:08:16,840
Swap out the movie files?

5664
08:08:17,479 --> 08:08:21,290
You're talking about the ones that I...

5665
08:08:21,290 --> 08:08:22,409
Oh yeah, let's do this.

5666
08:08:23,049 --> 08:08:25,909
Let's try this.

5667
08:08:27,240 --> 08:08:31,290
So it's because I've shot the movie, maybe.

5668
08:08:31,290 --> 08:08:34,700
So technically, let's just see.

5669
08:08:34,700 --> 08:08:39,290
So I have these, the presentation and the TRL both saved here.

5670
08:08:39,290 --> 08:08:43,819
I'm gonna paste these back in and I'm not gonna reshoot it.

5671
08:08:43,819 --> 08:08:46,299
I'm literally just gonna paste these back and then go to the movie player.

5672
08:08:49,700 --> 08:08:50,099
Damn it.

5673
08:08:51,220 --> 08:08:54,340
I'm like, annoyed by this, but like at the same time.

5674
08:08:55,060 --> 08:08:56,150
I don't know.

5675
08:08:56,150 --> 08:08:57,590
That just like sucks, but whatever.

5676
08:08:58,389 --> 08:08:59,270
But hopefully this works.

5677
08:09:02,150 --> 08:09:03,029
Oh, let's go...

5678
08:09:04,069 --> 08:09:08,139
I wish we could have seen the whole thing.

5679
08:09:10,740 --> 08:09:11,540
I still could do it.

5680
08:09:11,540 --> 08:09:13,299
I still could do it, but let's just try this.

5681
08:09:15,450 --> 08:09:19,799
Let's go back to my documents.

5682
08:09:19,799 --> 08:09:21,560
Go to the movies.

5683
08:09:22,360 --> 08:09:24,659
This would be a good indicator here.

5684
08:09:25,700 --> 08:09:33,979
If E3 presentation is 30 kilobytes and 132 kilobytes for what's in there now,

5685
08:09:35,610 --> 08:09:36,490
what is it over here?

5686
08:09:36,490 --> 08:09:37,770
I just like burped internally.

5687
08:09:41,659 --> 08:09:43,340
I wonder if this will change.

5688
08:09:45,720 --> 08:09:48,599
All right, guys, guys, we have a...

5689
08:09:48,599 --> 08:10:00,439
Guys, I think this is gonna work because they're different file sizes.

5690
08:10:00,439 --> 08:10:01,880
They're different file sizes.

5691
08:10:01,880 --> 08:10:04,520
If this works, oh, I'm gonna pee with such joy.

5692
08:10:04,520 --> 08:10:05,159
Come on, they're different.

5693
08:10:05,159 --> 08:10:06,200
They're not the same size.

5694
08:10:06,200 --> 08:10:07,479
That has to mean something.

5695
08:10:07,479 --> 08:10:09,270
Okay, here we go.

5696
08:10:09,270 --> 08:10:11,259
I'm gonna paste them in here.

5697
08:10:11,259 --> 08:10:12,619
I have the originals right here.

5698
08:10:13,180 --> 08:10:16,310
Paste them in, replace the files.

5699
08:10:18,099 --> 08:10:19,139
Yeah, they're different files.

5700
08:10:19,139 --> 08:10:20,419
They're fucking different file sizes.

5701
08:10:20,419 --> 08:10:21,299
It has to mean something.

5702
08:10:21,299 --> 08:10:21,619
Let's go.

5703
08:10:22,259 --> 08:10:23,909
Here we go.

5704
08:10:23,909 --> 08:10:31,459
Oh, wait, I have to...

5705
08:10:36,060 --> 08:10:38,139
Compact file means there's less data,

5706
08:10:38,139 --> 08:10:41,259
which means that makes sense because I was cutting things, right?

5707
08:10:41,990 --> 08:10:42,389
Right?

5708
08:10:42,950 --> 08:10:43,990
Please tell me that's right.

5709
08:10:51,669 --> 08:10:52,549
Let's see what happens.

5710
08:10:52,549 --> 08:10:53,509
Here we go.

5711
08:10:53,509 --> 08:11:02,950
So just from here, we're gonna go to the movie player.

5712
08:11:03,669 --> 08:11:06,659
I'm a CS student.

5713
08:11:06,659 --> 08:11:08,180
That's 100% correct.

5714
08:11:08,180 --> 08:11:15,430
Let's hope so.

5715
08:11:15,430 --> 08:11:16,569
Movie player.

5716
08:11:42,020 --> 08:11:42,900
What is this?

5717
08:11:42,900 --> 08:11:43,220
Load.

5718
08:12:00,139 --> 08:12:01,180
No, none of the cuts are here.

5719
08:12:01,900 --> 08:12:13,340
Because there was so many cuts that I did just to clean everything up.

5720
08:12:13,340 --> 08:12:16,950
Oh, no, like this is...

5721
08:12:17,590 --> 08:12:18,150
Let's just see.

5722
08:12:18,150 --> 08:12:18,470
Hold on.

5723
08:12:20,470 --> 08:12:21,029
Yeah, see?

5724
08:12:22,150 --> 08:12:23,349
I did a lot of...

5725
08:12:24,150 --> 08:12:27,509
It's time to cut.

5726
08:12:27,509 --> 08:12:29,830
If I remember where I cut everything,

5727
08:12:30,549 --> 08:12:32,310
it should line up in the same place.

5728
08:12:32,950 --> 08:12:38,619
I just don't remember everything.

5729
08:12:39,659 --> 08:12:40,619
Why is there a ghost here?

5730
08:12:40,619 --> 08:12:40,860
No.

5731
08:12:43,459 --> 08:12:44,659
Speed run the movie?

5732
08:12:44,659 --> 08:12:46,259
I'm so disappointed right now.

5733
08:12:47,080 --> 08:12:47,959
I still have the audio.

5734
08:12:47,959 --> 08:12:48,599
I still have the...

5735
08:12:50,200 --> 08:12:56,380
I don't remember where everything was.

5736
08:13:01,779 --> 08:13:02,819
That still fits.

5737
08:13:03,380 --> 08:13:04,259
That's still...

5738
08:13:04,259 --> 08:13:05,060
All right.

5739
08:13:05,060 --> 08:13:05,860
This is still okay.

5740
08:13:06,659 --> 08:13:07,459
What's not okay?

5741
08:13:10,490 --> 08:13:10,970
Wait, what?

5742
08:13:14,490 --> 08:13:15,369
Why is that back?

5743
08:13:16,090 --> 08:13:17,610
I saved right after doing this.

5744
08:13:21,799 --> 08:13:23,880
I think this whole thing is fucked up.

5745
08:13:26,139 --> 08:13:28,540
It was right before, but where are the cuts then?

5746
08:13:30,099 --> 08:13:31,779
Am I insane or are they here?

5747
08:13:40,819 --> 08:13:41,540
Don't die on me.

5748
08:13:42,180 --> 08:13:46,220
You die on me.

5749
08:13:46,220 --> 08:13:47,020
Come on.

5750
08:13:49,610 --> 08:13:50,569
My co-captain.

5751
08:13:51,369 --> 08:13:52,650
You were my co-pilot.

5752
08:13:53,610 --> 08:13:59,060
Okay, I think it's still salvageable.

5753
08:14:06,779 --> 08:14:08,939
I'm getting a reading of a strange creature up here.

5754
08:14:08,939 --> 08:14:09,819
No, the cuts are...

5755
08:14:11,419 --> 08:14:12,860
That was the big kicker here.

5756
08:14:12,860 --> 08:14:14,060
I cut it here, remember?

5757
08:14:20,900 --> 08:14:22,180
I'm just gonna go for it.

5758
08:14:22,180 --> 08:14:22,900
I'm going for it.

5759
08:14:27,610 --> 08:14:28,250
Now, because look.

5760
08:14:28,250 --> 08:14:29,049
Yeah, no, no, no, no.

5761
08:14:29,049 --> 08:14:30,090
That's not the right place to cut.

5762
08:14:30,090 --> 08:14:31,130
It's over here.

5763
08:14:31,130 --> 08:14:34,779
This might actually save the whole thing.

5764
08:14:35,340 --> 08:14:39,939
Where was it?

5765
08:14:39,939 --> 08:14:42,119
It was like right here, right?

5766
08:14:46,759 --> 08:14:48,279
I'm not gonna get this exact, but...

5767
08:14:48,680 --> 08:14:50,119
Because then he crashes through.

5768
08:14:50,759 --> 08:14:58,709
Let's just do this.

5769
08:14:58,709 --> 08:14:59,430
I know it's like...

5770
08:15:00,069 --> 08:15:07,830
Because then the whole thing shrinks down.

5771
08:15:07,830 --> 08:15:16,619
It could be, it possibly could be...

5772
08:15:22,599 --> 08:15:24,040
I'm getting a read...

5773
08:15:24,040 --> 08:15:24,919
This cuts here.

5774
08:15:30,919 --> 08:15:33,400
Getting a reading of a strange creature up here.

5775
08:15:33,400 --> 08:15:34,279
I don't know what it could be.

5776
08:15:34,279 --> 08:15:36,200
It could possibly be an organic compound.

5777
08:15:38,650 --> 08:15:39,150
What is that?

5778
08:15:41,750 --> 08:15:42,250
It's close.

5779
08:15:46,970 --> 08:15:48,729
It was right here, I think.

5780
08:15:50,470 --> 08:15:51,669
Right before he puts his hand on his chin.

5781
08:15:58,340 --> 08:15:58,840
No!

5782
08:16:01,000 --> 08:16:06,090
I'm getting a reading of a strange creature up here.

5783
08:16:06,090 --> 08:16:07,130
It doesn't matter.

5784
08:16:07,130 --> 08:16:07,630
It's okay.

5785
08:16:10,110 --> 08:16:14,909
I'm getting a reading of a strange creature up here.

5786
08:16:14,909 --> 08:16:16,430
We can have some messed up parts.

5787
08:16:16,430 --> 08:16:18,590
I'm getting a reading of a strange creature up here.

5788
08:16:18,590 --> 08:16:19,950
I don't know what it could be.

5789
08:16:19,950 --> 08:16:21,630
Possibly an organic compound.

5790
08:16:24,090 --> 08:16:24,590
What is that?

5791
08:16:27,479 --> 08:16:29,959
It's progress, but it's gonna take a lot of time.

5792
08:16:30,680 --> 08:16:32,040
Damn it.

5793
08:16:32,040 --> 08:16:35,799
It's still off a little.

5794
08:16:35,799 --> 08:16:36,520
I had it so...

5795
08:16:37,500 --> 08:16:39,900
The stupid clown laughing.

5796
08:16:39,900 --> 08:16:40,400
Shit.

5797
08:16:41,380 --> 08:16:42,259
What is that?

5798
08:16:42,259 --> 08:16:43,860
Let me see if this whole thing's screwed up now.

5799
08:16:51,380 --> 08:16:53,139
It's just so off.

5800
08:16:55,150 --> 08:16:55,790
That it's...

5801
08:16:56,349 --> 08:16:57,630
I'm like working backwards.

5802
08:17:02,770 --> 08:17:03,490
I'm depressed.

5803
08:17:06,049 --> 08:17:07,729
Because I was about to like get this done.

5804
08:17:07,729 --> 08:17:08,529
And now it's like...

5805
08:17:14,020 --> 08:17:18,930
The kind of steam has left the engine here, unfortunately.

5806
08:17:26,270 --> 08:17:27,389
It's definitely fixable.

5807
08:17:37,310 --> 08:17:37,790
I'm so...

5808
08:17:40,220 --> 08:17:41,580
Like salty's not like mad.

5809
08:17:41,580 --> 08:17:42,540
It's not even the right word.

5810
08:17:43,419 --> 08:17:45,549
Let me just go back and load it again.

5811
08:17:46,189 --> 08:17:48,139
I need to see it again.

5812
08:17:52,240 --> 08:17:52,740
Why?

5813
08:17:53,729 --> 08:17:54,290
Why?

5814
08:17:54,290 --> 08:17:54,689
Why?

5815
08:17:54,689 --> 08:17:55,250
Why?

5816
08:17:55,250 --> 08:17:56,290
This never happened before.

5817
08:17:56,290 --> 08:17:57,569
I've played this game before too.

5818
08:18:05,139 --> 08:18:05,939
I'm getting a reading.

5819
08:18:10,509 --> 08:18:16,159
You need to rest.

5820
08:18:18,479 --> 08:18:19,680
I'm so unfulfilled.

5821
08:18:19,680 --> 08:18:21,840
This has been like such a long time coming.

5822
08:18:21,840 --> 08:18:23,840
I'm not fulfilled at all.

5823
08:18:26,750 --> 08:18:28,430
Don't stack 10 laugh tracks.

5824
08:18:28,430 --> 08:18:30,909
Yeah, but how would I have known that that was gonna break everything?

5825
08:18:32,419 --> 08:18:33,459
I would never have known that.

5826
08:18:34,020 --> 08:18:35,299
And I was saving it too.

5827
08:18:35,299 --> 08:18:36,340
So it's not like I...

5828
08:18:36,340 --> 08:18:38,819
I mean if a game crashes, you would assume.

5829
08:18:38,819 --> 08:18:44,750
I think it's...

5830
08:18:44,750 --> 08:18:45,549
Where is it?

5831
08:18:45,549 --> 08:18:46,509
Right before...

5832
08:18:47,549 --> 08:18:48,349
Or right after.

5833
08:18:49,069 --> 08:18:57,779
Where the audio starts with each clip, you know where to start.

5834
08:18:57,779 --> 08:19:00,180
Yeah, but the problem is if I cut right here...

5835
08:19:02,369 --> 08:19:03,250
This is just...

5836
08:19:03,250 --> 08:19:05,090
I did all this before putting in the audio.

5837
08:19:05,090 --> 08:19:05,490
And when you...

5838
08:19:05,490 --> 08:19:07,409
Every time you trim something, it moves everything.

5839
08:19:09,889 --> 08:19:11,729
You use the vase to see the exact timing.

5840
08:19:12,529 --> 08:19:12,849
Here...

5841
08:19:12,849 --> 08:19:13,169
All right.

5842
08:19:13,169 --> 08:19:14,369
Here's what's gonna happen with this.

5843
08:19:15,790 --> 08:19:16,349
Here's the deal.

5844
08:19:17,069 --> 08:19:17,569
Okay.

5845
08:19:19,419 --> 08:19:19,819
I'm gonna...

5846
08:19:19,819 --> 08:19:25,250
Because I'm playing this again with mods, I'm going to...

5847
08:19:25,250 --> 08:19:25,889
Off stream.

5848
08:19:26,860 --> 08:19:28,380
I am going to finish this.

5849
08:19:29,180 --> 08:19:29,740
Off stream.

5850
08:19:30,299 --> 08:19:32,290
I'm gonna sleep.

5851
08:19:32,290 --> 08:19:33,009
I'll come back to it.

5852
08:19:33,009 --> 08:19:34,689
I'm gonna finish this one off stream.

5853
08:19:34,689 --> 08:19:35,810
Have it done to watch.

5854
08:19:39,090 --> 08:19:39,650
Because you...

5855
08:19:40,290 --> 08:19:40,849
It was done.

5856
08:19:40,849 --> 08:19:41,970
It was like pretty much done.

5857
08:19:41,970 --> 08:19:43,330
There's like a little bit left.

5858
08:19:43,330 --> 08:19:45,250
It's like this portion here.

5859
08:19:45,250 --> 08:19:48,259
And there's this tiny little portion over here.

5860
08:19:48,259 --> 08:19:51,700
So because it's just getting late, then I'm not gonna lie.

5861
08:19:51,700 --> 08:19:53,540
I'm a little disappointed.

5862
08:19:53,540 --> 08:19:57,970
But we will watch this one on the next movie stream.

5863
08:19:58,529 --> 08:20:02,130
Because that means that I can get out of the default ones

5864
08:20:02,130 --> 08:20:05,009
and we can get all the weird characters and all the new props and all the new stuff.

5865
08:20:05,650 --> 08:20:08,849
We'll open with this one.

5866
08:20:08,849 --> 08:20:11,330
And then that'll be good because maybe the people that weren't here

5867
08:20:11,330 --> 08:20:16,430
for this stream could just enjoy the three to four or five hours

5868
08:20:16,430 --> 08:20:17,310
that it took to make this one.

5869
08:20:17,310 --> 08:20:18,270
You know what I'm saying?

5870
08:20:18,270 --> 08:20:21,599
I think that's the best plan.

5871
08:20:21,599 --> 08:20:26,029
Because we are going on eight and a half hours here.

5872
08:20:26,029 --> 08:20:31,779
So the plan here is I am off tomorrow.

5873
08:20:32,419 --> 08:20:34,900
I have to make a few phone calls tomorrow.

5874
08:20:34,900 --> 08:20:36,500
I think they're going to be lengthy.

5875
08:20:36,500 --> 08:20:38,700
I can't really stream tomorrow.

5876
08:20:38,700 --> 08:20:44,139
Tuesday or Wednesday, depending, either depends on when Star is around.

5877
08:20:44,139 --> 08:20:50,240
Star and I are going to play Deep Rock Galactic together

5878
08:20:50,240 --> 08:20:52,430
on either Tuesday or Wednesday.

5879
08:20:52,430 --> 08:20:56,029
And whatever day that we do that, you know,

5880
08:20:56,029 --> 08:21:00,049
the movies mod stream will be the other day.

5881
08:21:00,049 --> 08:21:02,130
So Tuesday is probably the day we're going to do it.

5882
08:21:02,130 --> 08:21:05,729
Wednesday will be the new movies one or flip it around.

5883
08:21:05,729 --> 08:21:06,369
We'll see.

5884
08:21:06,369 --> 08:21:10,880
But that's the plan for the next two streams.

5885
08:21:10,880 --> 08:21:13,700
So that's where I have to call it.

5886
08:21:13,700 --> 08:21:16,500
I'm sorry, everybody.

5887
08:21:16,500 --> 08:21:18,259
Kind of a all over the place stream.

5888
08:21:18,259 --> 08:21:26,000
But I've laughed harder than I fucking have in a long time.

5889
08:21:26,000 --> 08:21:27,520
This game is fucking hilarious.

5890
08:21:27,520 --> 08:21:30,159
It's kind of buggy and broken as some of the stuff could be.

5891
08:21:30,159 --> 08:21:35,470
I got at least like 45 minutes of straight laughing.

5892
08:21:35,470 --> 08:21:41,310
So I hope you enjoyed it, too.

5893
08:21:41,310 --> 08:21:42,029
We will come back.

5894
08:21:43,389 --> 08:21:44,669
Batman is a character.

5895
08:21:44,669 --> 08:21:46,779
We're going to do like a Batman one.

5896
08:21:46,779 --> 08:21:48,860
I'll be honest with you here.

5897
08:21:48,860 --> 08:21:55,229
I might make a couple more to show just so you can see them

5898
08:21:55,229 --> 08:21:58,860
without knowing what they are just before we get started

5899
08:21:58,860 --> 08:22:01,889
on the other ones to get.

5900
08:22:01,889 --> 08:22:04,209
I kind of want to get some more experience in it.

5901
08:22:04,209 --> 08:22:05,979
Maybe I'll just hang out up here tomorrow

5902
08:22:05,979 --> 08:22:09,740
and just like chill and make a couple.

5903
08:22:09,740 --> 08:22:11,220
We'll see.

5904
08:22:11,220 --> 08:22:13,569
But thanks for watching, everybody.

5905
08:22:13,569 --> 08:22:15,650
If you're I mean, I'm going to save it.

5906
08:22:15,650 --> 08:22:16,049
It's all right.

5907
08:22:16,049 --> 08:22:17,009
I got the files.

5908
08:22:17,569 --> 08:22:25,409
I'm just going to go through this on my own.

5909
08:22:25,409 --> 08:22:27,009
So it's already saved.

5910
08:22:27,009 --> 08:22:33,060
Yeah, I'm going to go back to the VOD

5911
08:22:33,060 --> 08:22:35,380
and find like the little exact points to cut.

5912
08:22:35,380 --> 08:22:37,099
But that's like painstaking.

5913
08:22:37,099 --> 08:22:40,349
I got to like all tab and go and move and get.

5914
08:22:40,349 --> 08:22:41,889
You don't want to be here for that.

5915
08:22:41,889 --> 08:22:43,330
That's really boring.

5916
08:22:43,330 --> 08:22:45,810
I don't think I want to put everybody through that,

5917
08:22:45,810 --> 08:22:49,729
especially after putting you through what I would assume

5918
08:22:49,729 --> 08:22:53,279
was like 40 straight minutes of trying to figure out

5919
08:22:53,279 --> 08:22:55,279
how to get everything to work correctly.

5920
08:22:55,279 --> 08:22:58,380
So I do apologize again for that.

5921
08:22:58,380 --> 08:23:02,220
But that's where the end of the stream is going to happen.

5922
08:23:02,220 --> 08:23:04,189
I'll see you guys on Tuesday.

5923
08:23:04,189 --> 08:23:10,130
Thanks again if you came from Joel's stream.

5924
08:23:10,130 --> 08:23:13,900
Joel, thanks for the raid again.

5925
08:23:13,900 --> 08:23:17,279
Yeah, I can watch it on like an iPad or phone or something.

5926
08:23:17,279 --> 08:23:17,759
I'll get it.

5927
08:23:17,759 --> 08:23:18,639
I'll get it.

5928
08:23:18,639 --> 08:23:19,360
I'll get it.

5929
08:23:19,360 --> 08:23:26,139
I need to do this.

5930
08:23:26,860 --> 08:23:31,299
Hey, look at that.

5931
08:23:31,299 --> 08:23:32,900
So pardon me while I'm going to pee.

5932
08:23:33,700 --> 08:23:34,099
I'll come back.

5933
08:23:34,099 --> 08:23:34,740
We'll do the bits.

5934
08:23:40,450 --> 08:23:41,970
The bits on another desktop.

5935
08:23:42,529 --> 08:23:47,869
I think the bits are on a different desktop than this.

5936
08:23:49,659 --> 08:23:50,139
Are they?

5937
08:23:50,779 --> 08:23:54,540
Oh, no, no, no.

5938
08:23:54,540 --> 08:23:54,939
I got them.

5939
08:23:54,939 --> 08:23:55,259
I got them.

5940
08:23:55,259 --> 08:23:55,900
Okay.

5941
08:23:55,900 --> 08:23:59,569
All right.

5942
08:23:59,569 --> 08:24:00,130
I'll be right back.

5943
08:24:00,130 --> 08:24:00,849
I'm going to pee.

5944
08:24:01,729 --> 08:24:02,930
And we will close this out.

5945
08:24:03,490 --> 08:24:05,200
Thanks for watching, guys.

5946
08:24:05,200 --> 08:24:05,680
Be right back.

5947
08:26:03,779 --> 08:26:04,419
All right, I'm back.

5948
08:26:05,220 --> 08:26:11,549
So let's go back to earlier.

5949
08:26:15,740 --> 08:26:19,310
We had this is eight hours ago.

5950
08:26:19,310 --> 08:26:20,029
Long time ago.

5951
08:26:20,590 --> 08:26:21,729
Curly snail.

5952
08:26:21,729 --> 08:26:22,849
Thanks for five dollars.

5953
08:26:22,849 --> 08:26:24,639
It's been a while.

5954
08:26:24,639 --> 08:26:25,439
Take my money.

5955
08:26:25,439 --> 08:26:30,880
We'll gladly take anything that you give me.

5956
08:26:31,950 --> 08:26:32,349
Thank you.

5957
08:26:32,349 --> 08:26:33,310
I really appreciate it.

5958
08:26:34,560 --> 08:26:36,500
Thank you.

5959
08:26:36,500 --> 08:26:39,619
Also, we had ten dollars from Reaper's Reviews.

5960
08:26:39,619 --> 08:26:40,500
Just no message.

5961
08:26:40,500 --> 08:26:41,060
Ten dollars.

5962
08:26:41,700 --> 08:26:42,900
Thank you, Reaper's Reviews.

5963
08:26:43,779 --> 08:26:45,979
Ten bucks coming in.

5964
08:26:46,540 --> 08:26:47,259
Really appreciate it.

5965
08:26:48,299 --> 08:26:49,099
Nile Orion.

5966
08:26:49,099 --> 08:26:49,819
Thanks for three bucks.

5967
08:26:49,819 --> 08:26:50,619
Great value.

5968
08:26:50,619 --> 08:26:51,580
Jex for next.

5969
08:26:51,580 --> 08:26:52,299
Jerma Rumble.

5970
08:27:00,830 --> 08:27:02,349
That would be pretty funny, actually.

5971
08:27:02,909 --> 08:27:04,750
I want to start working on that, too.

5972
08:27:04,750 --> 08:27:05,549
It's been long enough.

5973
08:27:06,189 --> 08:27:10,990
There's a lot of things I want to just do.

5974
08:27:11,709 --> 08:27:16,750
But thank you, Nile Orion.

5975
08:27:18,959 --> 08:27:19,919
Yes is online.

5976
08:27:19,919 --> 08:27:20,959
Thanks for the five dollars.

5977
08:27:20,959 --> 08:27:24,720
Turns out I completely forgot I made this green screen video before I moved to LA.

5978
08:27:25,279 --> 08:27:28,560
I also got that lump in my chest checked out and turns out it is benign.

5979
08:27:29,279 --> 08:27:30,560
Hope your father's day was good.

5980
08:27:31,860 --> 08:27:33,220
Thank you so much for the five dollars.

5981
08:27:34,180 --> 08:27:41,869
And my father, I'm going to be seeing my father really soon.

5982
08:27:42,750 --> 08:27:47,569
So, but that's glad that you've got that checked out and everything is

5983
08:27:48,610 --> 08:27:50,540
everything's good to go.

5984
08:27:51,180 --> 08:27:56,990
Because that shit is, you know, it can be fucking scary.

5985
08:27:58,380 --> 08:28:01,659
I'm still waiting on some biopsies, which I would have told.

5986
08:28:02,540 --> 08:28:03,819
Everything seems to be okay.

5987
08:28:03,819 --> 08:28:06,299
But you know, you always just keeps you up at night sometimes.

5988
08:28:07,099 --> 08:28:12,159
It takes a couple of weeks for them to come back.

5989
08:28:12,159 --> 08:28:12,959
Two, three weeks, I think.

5990
08:28:14,340 --> 08:28:16,180
It is like a, you know, it's a scary fucking thing.

5991
08:28:17,330 --> 08:28:18,049
Take care of yourself.

5992
08:28:18,610 --> 08:28:21,869
Keep yourselves in check.

5993
08:28:25,139 --> 08:28:26,500
But a green screen video.

5994
08:28:26,500 --> 08:28:31,389
We're going to do a green screen Encore Night on the 29th of June.

5995
08:28:32,590 --> 08:28:34,830
I'm going to hold this off until then.

5996
08:28:39,409 --> 08:28:40,529
Chat during stream.

5997
08:28:40,529 --> 08:28:42,529
LOL, this guy is a fucking idiot.

5998
08:28:42,529 --> 08:28:43,090
Wow.

5999
08:28:43,090 --> 08:28:44,209
Chat at the end of stream.

6000
08:28:44,209 --> 08:28:44,849
Hearts.

6001
08:28:44,849 --> 08:28:45,729
Love you, Jerma.

6002
08:28:51,380 --> 08:28:52,900
The duality of man.

6003
08:28:56,049 --> 08:28:56,290
No.

6004
08:28:56,290 --> 08:28:57,889
For the most part, people are just messing around.

6005
08:28:59,150 --> 08:29:02,029
I mean, I do some pretty stupid fucking things.

6006
08:29:02,029 --> 08:29:10,349
So I am not at, I am not completely absolved of all crime here.

6007
08:29:10,909 --> 08:29:15,279
But thank you so much for the video.

6008
08:29:15,279 --> 08:29:16,080
Hold on to it though.

6009
08:29:16,880 --> 08:29:18,900
Over the next week or so.

6010
08:29:20,740 --> 08:29:22,180
Well, probably in a couple days.

6011
08:29:24,209 --> 08:29:29,580
At least like a week before I'll get a good idea of kind of how we want to set that up.

6012
08:29:30,299 --> 08:29:32,939
Because I don't want like 500 video.

6013
08:29:32,939 --> 08:29:36,380
I kind of just want the ones that we haven't seen that have trickled through.

6014
08:29:37,700 --> 08:29:42,099
I don't want that to be like an eight hour, four or 500 video stream like the first one was.

6015
08:29:42,099 --> 08:29:47,220
I'd rather that just be like a chill, you know, not like a huge, huge, huge thing.

6016
08:29:48,259 --> 08:29:56,799
Is there more green screen footage for the Encore or do we just use the original?

6017
08:29:58,459 --> 08:30:01,340
It's just the stuff that's there and whatever other clips that you'd want to use.

6018
08:30:02,299 --> 08:30:05,259
But I would really like to get that.

6019
08:30:05,259 --> 08:30:09,020
So it was stuff that we missed and stuff people have made since.

6020
08:30:10,130 --> 08:30:12,049
And maybe a few others here and there.

6021
08:30:12,049 --> 08:30:17,020
It's not going to be, it'll be a little bit more condensed.

6022
08:30:17,740 --> 08:30:25,259
It'd be condensed, but it should be fun.

6023
08:30:25,259 --> 08:30:30,930
That also might just be on the end of a stream for a couple hours.

6024
08:30:30,930 --> 08:30:31,810
You know, an hour or two.

6025
08:30:32,369 --> 08:30:37,790
I will have some more details in the next three or four days.

6026
08:30:38,349 --> 08:30:43,389
I will probably, I'm going to be talking to mods in the Discord.

6027
08:30:44,270 --> 08:30:47,069
We'll get another probably channel going.

6028
08:30:51,220 --> 08:30:55,549
Not going to be a big, big thing.

6029
08:30:55,549 --> 08:30:58,590
But thank you to Tumsup for the 250.

6030
08:30:59,229 --> 08:31:00,750
Thanks for making my night like you always do.

6031
08:31:00,750 --> 08:31:03,310
My chest hurts from laughing and I've only been watching for an hour.

6032
08:31:06,560 --> 08:31:07,360
Thank you.

6033
08:31:07,360 --> 08:31:09,779
I'm glad you think it was fun.

6034
08:31:11,779 --> 08:31:14,740
I was so, it's weird this stream was so all over the place.

6035
08:31:15,900 --> 08:31:21,759
I was at my most upset and at my happiest on the same day.

6036
08:31:22,799 --> 08:31:23,889
That's weird.

6037
08:31:25,060 --> 08:31:28,900
I was so infuriated by like two or three things that happened tonight.

6038
08:31:29,860 --> 08:31:32,340
And it was like yin and yang tonight.

6039
08:31:35,119 --> 08:31:38,240
When I thought I wasn't going to be able to open the expansion pack.

6040
08:31:38,240 --> 08:31:40,080
Oh, you're talking, that's the yang.

6041
08:31:43,389 --> 08:31:46,590
When I slurped and spit into the person's mouth I was doing CPR with.

6042
08:31:47,150 --> 08:31:48,860
That's the yin right there.

6043
08:31:58,419 --> 08:32:00,419
You had four miracles tonight.

6044
08:32:00,419 --> 08:32:03,169
Yeah, I guess I did.

6045
08:32:03,889 --> 08:32:10,430
The high point was the spit and slurp.

6046
08:32:10,430 --> 08:32:15,150
I also think the bathtub and the E3 headbutt.

6047
08:32:15,150 --> 08:32:17,389
There was, I wish I could get that done.

6048
08:32:17,389 --> 08:32:18,029
I'm so sad.

6049
08:32:21,889 --> 08:32:22,450
Oh well.

6050
08:32:22,450 --> 08:32:24,849
I can't be crying over spilled E3.

6051
08:32:25,650 --> 08:32:27,650
Just have to clean it up.

6052
08:32:28,290 --> 08:32:29,840
Fortnite dance, yeah.

6053
08:32:31,840 --> 08:32:33,279
Yeah, there's some good things.

6054
08:32:33,840 --> 08:32:38,299
But thank you.

6055
08:32:39,180 --> 08:32:41,580
Thank you Pajagalo for the 10 bucks.

6056
08:32:42,299 --> 08:32:42,939
Ten dollars.

6057
08:32:42,939 --> 08:32:46,459
Hey Jeremy, just checking in from our parent corporation to inform you that

6058
08:32:46,459 --> 08:32:51,180
as per your contract, every film you make must end with a gorilla reading a book.

6059
08:32:51,180 --> 08:32:53,819
We had a great gorilla punchline at the end of E3.

6060
08:32:54,299 --> 08:32:58,700
The gorilla was on Reddit angry at the E3 conference that he just watched.

6061
08:32:59,500 --> 08:33:02,049
There was a pretty good callback there.

6062
08:33:02,849 --> 08:33:07,169
I was happy about that one.

6063
08:33:07,729 --> 08:33:10,159
So that technically counts.

6064
08:33:10,159 --> 08:33:15,419
But thank you for the 10 dollars.

6065
08:33:16,610 --> 08:33:18,689
Thank you Swiggity Swanky for the 7 dollars.

6066
08:33:19,700 --> 08:33:21,139
I know how much you love dreams.

6067
08:33:21,779 --> 08:33:25,380
I dreamt that I went to Germacon, but when I arrived it was empty.

6068
08:33:26,270 --> 08:33:28,509
It was only you and me, no one else.

6069
08:33:28,509 --> 08:33:31,630
When I asked where everyone was, you asked me to shake your hand.

6070
08:33:32,270 --> 08:33:37,790
But before I could do anything, you lunged at my hand and grasped it, holding it firmly.

6071
08:33:38,349 --> 08:33:43,950
I saw my arm was merging with yours, slowly absorbing me like from the thing.

6072
08:33:44,750 --> 08:33:47,150
I couldn't pull away and soon became you.

6073
08:33:48,220 --> 08:33:51,180
Now I understand why no one was at Germacon.

6074
08:33:57,650 --> 08:33:59,090
Just absorbing everybody?

6075
08:34:01,139 --> 08:34:03,680
Chat was Jerma all along.

6076
08:34:03,680 --> 08:34:04,880
Oh my god.

6077
08:34:04,880 --> 08:34:06,000
That's fucking insane.

6078
08:34:08,479 --> 08:34:12,479
If I ever do like a meetup here in Vegas, I will not be doing that.

6079
08:34:14,720 --> 08:34:15,840
T2000.

6080
08:34:18,049 --> 08:34:19,169
Very detailed dreams.

6081
08:34:26,560 --> 08:34:27,360
Thank you to...

6082
08:34:28,479 --> 08:34:30,319
Thank you to Nickname Jack for the 3 dollars.

6083
08:34:30,319 --> 08:34:31,919
Haven't shown any love in a while, so here it is.

6084
08:34:32,639 --> 08:34:33,919
Much love Mr. Pee Pants.

6085
08:34:35,229 --> 08:34:35,630
Thank you.

6086
08:34:38,369 --> 08:34:39,330
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

6087
08:34:44,029 --> 08:34:46,270
We had Never Trust a Purple.

6088
08:34:46,909 --> 08:34:49,250
Thank you Purple for the 10 dollars.

6089
08:34:51,490 --> 08:34:53,810
Yo Jerma, any plan on a 3 year sub badge?

6090
08:34:53,810 --> 08:34:54,049
Yes.

6091
08:34:54,689 --> 08:34:58,779
There's gonna be a lot of random things added and changed on the channel.

6092
08:34:59,500 --> 08:35:02,319
There's gonna be lots of new sub badges.

6093
08:35:02,319 --> 08:35:04,720
There's gonna be new screens, a bunch of new music,

6094
08:35:06,830 --> 08:35:10,909
a bunch of changes in the back end of the channel.

6095
08:35:10,909 --> 08:35:11,869
There's gonna be a lot of...

6096
08:35:11,869 --> 08:35:13,150
There's gonna be a lot of new things here.

6097
08:35:13,950 --> 08:35:17,779
What about a no sub badge?

6098
08:35:18,849 --> 08:35:21,659
Yeah, I mean, that's fine.

6099
08:35:22,380 --> 08:35:24,419
You don't have to have a sub badge.

6100
08:35:24,419 --> 08:35:28,849
You don't have to have one.

6101
08:35:28,849 --> 08:35:34,770
Jerma default dance.

6102
08:35:35,330 --> 08:35:36,700
But thank you Purple.

6103
08:35:39,250 --> 08:35:44,909
Also DC Pro, thank you for the 245.

6104
08:35:44,909 --> 08:35:48,270
But I'm gonna say, I'm gonna round it up.

6105
08:35:48,270 --> 08:35:49,069
I'm tired.

6106
08:35:49,630 --> 08:35:50,349
I'm rounding it up.

6107
08:35:51,360 --> 08:35:51,759
Thank you.

6108
08:35:53,180 --> 08:35:54,459
Father's Day always sucks for me,

6109
08:35:54,459 --> 08:35:56,700
but last night's stream and tonight's stream got me through the weekend.

6110
08:35:56,700 --> 08:35:57,979
Thank you Jerma, hope all is well.

6111
08:35:58,540 --> 08:36:05,220
I'm sorry to hear that.

6112
08:36:05,220 --> 08:36:09,340
I'm sorry to hear that Father's Day is not a good day for you.

6113
08:36:09,340 --> 08:36:14,110
But we got a community of fun little jokesters here.

6114
08:36:18,639 --> 08:36:22,080
I'm sitting here talking about this fun great community of people

6115
08:36:22,080 --> 08:36:24,479
and they're so interesting and so helpful and so great.

6116
08:36:25,279 --> 08:36:26,479
How about another streamer?

6117
08:36:26,479 --> 08:36:28,000
Replace the streamer.

6118
08:36:28,000 --> 08:36:29,040
What about a new streamer?

6119
08:36:29,040 --> 08:36:29,840
This one is...

6120
08:36:29,840 --> 08:36:31,360
How do we get rid of behind a new host?

6121
08:36:32,400 --> 08:36:41,599
Any plan on new emotes?

6122
08:36:41,599 --> 08:36:47,220
Yeah, there'll be like five new emotes, maybe more.

6123
08:36:49,470 --> 08:36:54,110
I want to redo the tier two and tier three emotes

6124
08:36:54,750 --> 08:36:56,669
because they're dog shit or they don't exist.

6125
08:36:57,389 --> 08:36:58,319
Does it...

6126
08:36:58,319 --> 08:36:59,680
We don't even have any tier two...

6127
08:36:59,680 --> 08:37:00,159
Are they gone?

6128
08:37:00,799 --> 08:37:01,520
They can have one.

6129
08:37:02,400 --> 08:37:04,959
No, I don't have any tier two or tier three.

6130
08:37:04,959 --> 08:37:06,900
I was gonna change them.

6131
08:37:12,139 --> 08:37:13,099
Wait, is still...

6132
08:37:13,099 --> 08:37:14,380
Is the golden BS still...

6133
08:37:14,939 --> 08:37:17,419
Oh yeah, golden BS is still tier two.

6134
08:37:19,380 --> 08:37:20,979
Tier three is gonna be just something stupid,

6135
08:37:21,779 --> 08:37:23,380
but there's gotta be something there at least.

6136
08:37:23,380 --> 08:37:24,020
There are like...

6137
08:37:25,180 --> 08:37:27,659
There are a handful of tier three subs,

6138
08:37:27,659 --> 08:37:32,340
so I obviously don't want to just not have anything.

6139
08:37:33,060 --> 08:37:43,389
I don't know why I played that.

6140
08:37:43,389 --> 08:37:47,090
The tab was open and I'm closing tabs,

6141
08:37:47,090 --> 08:37:48,529
getting ready to end the stream,

6142
08:37:48,529 --> 08:37:49,970
and I just figured I would press the button.

6143
08:37:50,770 --> 08:37:54,369
What is this?

6144
08:37:55,330 --> 08:37:57,889
We are just so excited to have you...

6145
08:38:00,400 --> 08:38:01,840
Oh, that's audacity, never mind.

6146
08:38:04,740 --> 08:38:05,299
Shit show.

6147
08:38:06,419 --> 08:38:07,220
Fucking shit show.

6148
08:38:07,220 --> 08:38:08,740
That beginning took me so long.

6149
08:38:09,540 --> 08:38:11,619
That's probably when Joel came in with the raid too

6150
08:38:11,619 --> 08:38:12,500
and I'm just sitting there going,

6151
08:38:12,500 --> 08:38:13,700
I can't fucking do it!

6152
08:38:13,700 --> 08:38:14,500
I can't do it!

6153
08:38:14,500 --> 08:38:16,900
Like screaming and like headbutting some lady.

6154
08:38:20,639 --> 08:38:21,919
So excited.

6155
08:38:21,919 --> 08:38:22,959
So excited.

6156
08:38:34,639 --> 08:38:36,479
Edit all the clips and audacity.

6157
08:38:36,479 --> 08:38:37,759
Yeah, I'll clean it up.

6158
08:38:37,759 --> 08:38:42,130
I'll clean it up.

6159
08:38:42,130 --> 08:38:43,409
But that's gonna be it.

6160
08:38:43,409 --> 08:38:44,450
I'm gonna roll the credits.

6161
08:38:44,450 --> 08:38:45,650
There's a couple more bits that came through,

6162
08:38:45,650 --> 08:38:47,250
but I was gonna make sure I get the credits rolling.

6163
08:38:48,290 --> 08:38:49,250
A lot of subs tonight.

6164
08:38:51,759 --> 08:38:53,040
That's pretty usual.

6165
08:38:53,040 --> 08:38:54,799
I mean, there's a lot of subs every night.

6166
08:38:54,799 --> 08:38:55,520
So thanks, guys.

6167
08:38:57,470 --> 08:38:59,709
Yeah, Joel raided like a few hours ago?

6168
08:38:59,709 --> 08:39:00,430
Two, three hours ago?

6169
08:39:06,319 --> 08:39:07,919
There's a lot of people that are

6170
08:39:07,919 --> 08:39:09,680
continuously subscribed to this channel.

6171
08:39:10,939 --> 08:39:12,380
Month to month, day to day.

6172
08:39:12,380 --> 08:39:12,939
Week to week.

6173
08:39:13,900 --> 08:39:14,700
Year to year.

6174
08:39:16,580 --> 08:39:19,549
Thanks.

6175
08:39:19,549 --> 08:39:21,069
I will see you all on Tuesday.

6176
08:39:24,619 --> 08:39:27,659
And Wednesday's stream is gonna be

6177
08:39:27,659 --> 08:39:28,860
the last one for a little while.

6178
08:39:30,080 --> 08:39:33,279
Visiting family and getting some work done on a stream.

6179
08:39:34,000 --> 08:39:37,389
So I will be working.

6180
08:39:38,029 --> 08:39:39,150
I will be.

6181
08:39:39,709 --> 08:39:41,740
Just won't be on camera.

6182
08:39:41,740 --> 08:39:47,970
And let's get the last couple of bits that came in here.

6183
08:39:49,970 --> 08:39:50,450
They are.

6184
08:39:54,209 --> 08:39:55,650
No, I think I got them all.

6185
08:39:55,650 --> 08:39:56,290
I got them all.

6186
08:40:00,959 --> 08:40:02,159
Thanks for the laughs you've given us

6187
08:40:02,159 --> 08:40:04,400
watching you broadcast E3 while at E3

6188
08:40:04,400 --> 08:40:06,560
was oddly one of the most hilarious things I've ever done.

6189
08:40:07,360 --> 08:40:08,639
Thank you for everything and take care.

6190
08:40:08,639 --> 08:40:09,840
I think that was creamy sensation.

6191
08:40:09,840 --> 08:40:10,340
Thank you.

6192
08:40:11,119 --> 08:40:15,220
Watching you broadcast E3 while at E3.

6193
08:40:16,419 --> 08:40:17,619
Hold on.

6194
08:40:17,619 --> 08:40:18,099
Wait a minute.

6195
08:40:22,939 --> 08:40:25,180
You were watching me broadcast E3

6196
08:40:25,180 --> 08:40:26,700
while you were sitting at E3?

6197
08:40:27,580 --> 08:40:30,369
That would have been interesting.

6198
08:40:35,439 --> 08:40:36,479
Yes, it's the dunk tank.

6199
08:40:37,040 --> 08:40:41,200
And I'm going to give you, because this is 1230, 1240.

6200
08:40:42,880 --> 08:40:44,400
At the very least, it's the dunk tank.

6201
08:40:44,400 --> 08:40:45,680
And if you don't know what I'm talking about,

6202
08:40:46,900 --> 08:40:48,340
let's just talk about it for a second.

6203
08:40:48,340 --> 08:40:48,900
Might as well.

6204
08:40:49,860 --> 08:40:52,819
Because this is the last time I probably will talk about it

6205
08:40:52,819 --> 08:40:55,139
until you see it or until we have to test some things.

6206
08:40:56,459 --> 08:41:00,209
But the dunk tank stream, if you weren't here

6207
08:41:00,209 --> 08:41:01,490
or don't know what I'm talking about,

6208
08:41:01,490 --> 08:41:03,250
I am going to get a dunk tank.

6209
08:41:04,209 --> 08:41:05,819
And not just a dunk tank.

6210
08:41:06,380 --> 08:41:08,830
Because at this point, I want to do more.

6211
08:41:10,639 --> 08:41:14,000
We are the very least going to try very desperately.

6212
08:41:14,720 --> 08:41:17,279
Because I do have somebody who is very knowledgeable now.

6213
08:41:17,279 --> 08:41:18,880
I have like an actual robotics team

6214
08:41:19,840 --> 08:41:21,520
that I'm emailing back and forth with.

6215
08:41:21,520 --> 08:41:22,639
I have some calls with.

6216
08:41:23,599 --> 08:41:25,439
And I'll be meeting with other people too.

6217
08:41:26,639 --> 08:41:31,419
So the dunk tank is going to be potentially me up there.

6218
08:41:32,299 --> 08:41:34,720
I've got a dunk tank expert.

6219
08:41:35,520 --> 08:41:37,020
There's going to be a pitching machine

6220
08:41:37,020 --> 08:41:38,779
that is going to be attached to a robot

6221
08:41:39,580 --> 08:41:43,939
which you will be controlling to try to dunk me.

6222
08:41:46,369 --> 08:41:51,549
On top of that, on top of that,

6223
08:41:52,189 --> 08:41:57,659
I'm going to probably try to do other games

6224
08:41:57,740 --> 08:41:59,500
like a claw machine that you guys control,

6225
08:41:59,500 --> 08:42:00,619
like a little carnival.

6226
08:42:03,139 --> 08:42:04,099
I'm going to try.

6227
08:42:05,150 --> 08:42:07,630
This could be a catastrophic failure.

6228
08:42:08,830 --> 08:42:10,189
But if I get the green light,

6229
08:42:12,990 --> 08:42:16,110
if I do over these next five to 10 days,

6230
08:42:16,110 --> 08:42:17,790
because this is what I'm going to be working on.

6231
08:42:18,590 --> 08:42:20,830
If I get the legit green light here,

6232
08:42:21,549 --> 08:42:23,069
I'm going to focus on it almost completely.

6233
08:42:26,909 --> 08:42:29,470
So that's the plan.

6234
08:42:30,029 --> 08:42:32,509
If the plan works or not, we'll find out.

6235
08:42:33,150 --> 08:42:37,119
That is what I'm going to be trying to do.

6236
08:42:38,000 --> 08:42:39,439
The reason why I'm talking about it now

6237
08:42:39,439 --> 08:42:40,799
and been alluding to it is

6238
08:42:40,799 --> 08:42:42,560
because we're going to have to test some stuff.

6239
08:42:43,939 --> 08:42:46,580
You're going to see in the chat room, randomly,

6240
08:42:46,580 --> 08:42:49,139
probably like me and other people

6241
08:42:49,139 --> 08:42:51,299
and mods and stuff like pressing buttons.

6242
08:42:53,220 --> 08:42:54,099
You're not going to have any idea

6243
08:42:54,099 --> 08:42:55,540
what the hell is going on.

6244
08:42:55,540 --> 08:42:56,900
So I want you to be aware of it.

6245
08:42:57,779 --> 08:43:08,209
Because I cannot just turn it on

6246
08:43:08,209 --> 08:43:09,569
and be like, let's see if it works.

6247
08:43:12,080 --> 08:43:13,040
No, no, no.

6248
08:43:13,040 --> 08:43:14,159
I'm going to make sure this works

6249
08:43:14,159 --> 08:43:17,439
because I'll be putting probably some cash

6250
08:43:18,000 --> 08:43:18,479
into this.

6251
08:43:25,729 --> 08:43:26,130
We'll see.

6252
08:43:29,060 --> 08:43:30,659
Hopefully, it's not wasted time.

6253
08:43:33,279 --> 08:43:34,000
Wish me luck.

6254
08:43:34,560 --> 08:43:39,279
But thank you, everybody, for watching.

6255
08:43:39,840 --> 08:43:41,040
I'll see you on Tuesday.

6256
08:43:45,419 --> 08:43:47,340
And we'll play some more games.

6257
08:43:47,340 --> 08:43:48,380
Star and I are going to do something

6258
08:43:48,380 --> 08:43:49,419
and you'll see some modded...

6259
08:43:50,220 --> 08:43:52,209
I almost said The Sims 4.

6260
08:43:52,209 --> 08:43:53,009
May as well be.

6261
08:43:53,650 --> 08:43:55,060
Have a great night.

6262
08:43:55,779 --> 08:43:56,419
See you Tuesday.

6263
08:43:57,220 --> 08:43:58,259
Take care, guys.

6264
08:43:58,259 --> 08:43:58,659
Goodbye.
