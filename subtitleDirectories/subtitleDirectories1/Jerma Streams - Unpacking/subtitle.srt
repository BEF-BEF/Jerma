1
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:18,410
I'm so excited for this. Yeah, let's do it. Hopefully it's not too loud. We'll find out.

2
00:00:27,190 --> 00:01:07,900
Why unpacking? I don't know, because I feel like it. I have played this game, haven't I?

3
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:15,510
I think me and Holly played it for a little bit. I feel like I've watched Holly. Like, I fell asleep

4
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:27,319
to Holly playing this. Calm down? What? I know, I, I, I just realized you can't see it. Come on.

5
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:47,590
I know, I'm working on it. Yeah, there already was a save file. I think I, I fell, I fell

6
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:57,530
asleep to Holly playing this. It was so relaxing. All right, you ready? So I think, yeah, I can open

7
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:04,579
up boxes. It's pre-recorded. No, it's not. All right, so I got to decorate the room.

8
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:11,860
Work faster. That's not the point of this, is to do it as slow as you can. You do this as slow as

9
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:27,560
possible. I don't like it. I don't like this. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. I gotta,

10
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,620
stop, stop. I'm freaking out. All right, stop. Put it away. Okay, I would put a soccer ball.

11
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,580
I'm gonna do this the way I would do it. Of course, I'm gonna put the trophy right here.

12
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:48,729
There's no time limit. Wouldn't be going too slow. I'm gonna, I want the money in the bed.

13
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:56,550
This is like art stuff. I'm gonna put it up here with the other art stuff.

14
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:09,419
This is a diary or something. Put it away. Uh, trash. Uh, put the game away too. Only take that

15
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:18,620
out when friends come over. Yeah, put this stuff away. It goes here. Cool. Speed. I like this. This

16
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:29,340
is fun. There's a game change. You're going too slow. I'm gonna start. I'm gonna start.

17
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:35,770
I'm gonna start timing you up. I'm gonna tie you up for real. You're getting timed out. Okay.

18
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:59,340
This is a nice place for that. I don't want this in my room. How do I put this away? I don't want

19
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:11,460
this in here. Put them in the bed. I don't want this in the room. Now, this is a book. Put the

20
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:20,410
toy. Okay. Toys are going on this side. All right. That's no, no, no. This is going in here.

21
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,019
Check this out. This is going to be where the, my journal is going to go in here.

22
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:28,660
Now that's safe. And the scissors can fit in there too. Everything can, right?

23
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:42,730
That's perfect. That's good. I don't want this in the room. That's like school supplies that's going

24
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:57,639
there. What's that? What the hell is this? All right. That's kind of cool. You can sit out there.

25
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:01,740
Flashlight. Just put it, put it away. I don't need it. Put the books over here.

26
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:27,740
Dear me, this is a choking hazard. Wait, how old am I? You're supposed to be three? What? I'm

27
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:45,579
supposed to be three, 23. Don't even. All right. That's fine. Just put all the stuffed animals in

28
00:05:45,579 --> 00:06:23,620
the bed. How would I even lie in this bed? I have too much stuff. What is this? I'll put this, oh,

29
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:45,850
on the sill. That's fine. All right. That's good. My bed has more than that. I got it. What's wrong

30
00:06:45,850 --> 00:07:05,480
with this? These are wrong. Just put them away. This is the most stressful game I've ever played.

31
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:39,319
Why? Finally, my own room. Quick playback. I try to throw the dinosaur away like five times.

32
00:07:39,879 --> 00:08:06,699
Tool assistant speed run. That looks fine. Okay. 2004. This is like a college room.

33
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:20,810
All right. This computer, computer's gonna go right here. I don't have like 40 stuffed animals,

34
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:28,360
right? This is a flute. I didn't mean to do that. I'm an idiot. All right. This is a book.

35
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:43,129
All right. Books are gonna go over here. Stand them up. All right. These are art supplies.

36
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:51,289
Um, oh, there's a kitchen and there's a bathtub. All right. All right. All right. All right. Right.

37
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:57,929
Right. Right. I gotta put this. I think I remember watching like I was, my eye was like this and I

38
00:08:57,929 --> 00:09:05,559
remember going like this and seeing like flashes of this while Holly was like organizing stuff.

39
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:17,669
I was just like, I was definitely not dreaming. All right. I'm gonna put these up here for now.

40
00:09:17,669 --> 00:09:29,980
These markers. I don't know if I'm up here. Book or books. I don't give, I don't give a

41
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:40,490
shit about books. All right. This can go here. I don't know what that is. It's going up with books.

42
00:09:41,370 --> 00:10:03,210
What's that? I don't know what that is. Oh, it's a poster. Okay. Well, put it right here.

43
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:22,120
Book. Book. We got a lot of books. Uh, toothbrush. Oh, no, no, no. Take this to the bathroom.

44
00:10:22,759 --> 00:11:02,519
Put that up here. Pants. Sneaker. What's the other one? Okay. Okay. A boot.

45
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:16,259
Remember, that's a mouse pad. This is a mouse pad. I don't want this ruler anyway. Get us out of here.

46
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:59,289
Okay. Whatever. This doesn't go under. Okay. These are, these are bras. Perfect. Gameboy. Uh,

47
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:16,710
put it on the shelf. Scratchy scratch. What is that? Files? Put it over here.

48
00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:31,740
Why a toaster? Why do you have a toaster? Oh, because of the kitchen. Right. Hold on.

49
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:52,120
To make toast. Yeah, but still. I can hang those up. I don't think I want to do that, though.

50
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,600
I hate hangers. They just give you two spikes on your shoulders. I hate it.

51
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:11,830
But I'll do it for now. You don't know what I'm talking about? When you, okay,

52
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:15,590
when you put something on a hanger and it sits in there for a long enough time,

53
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:23,929
you end up getting this shit. It looks like this and there's nothing you can do to get rid of it.

54
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:42,169
It just looks like this. You have to wash the shirt to get rid of it. It's like an iPod.

55
00:13:42,889 --> 00:14:16,019
Get a smaller hanger. I'm not, no, I'm not using a meat hook. I get, I get this shit out of the way.

56
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:27,509
I can't see. Okay. Jeans are going to go there. Fuck. Okay. Hold on. Hang up the ones that you

57
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:33,580
should hang up. Fold the t-shirts. T-shirts are going to go here. Hang this up right here.

58
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:40,620
All right. Sweaters, sweatshirts. This looks like an alarm clock. It is. Yeah. Fold up the shirts.

59
00:14:40,620 --> 00:15:03,879
Hang up the big ones. What is that? What is all this stuff? I think this is pants. Should I do

60
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:12,950
this by color? I don't care. I genuinely don't care. I just reach in and grab clothes. I don't

61
00:15:12,950 --> 00:16:02,779
care. Oh, right. I got it. Is there any more? What is all this shit? Too much stuff. I just want,

62
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:07,909
I told you like my, I should do this the way that I would actually do my room. And I'm telling you

63
00:16:07,909 --> 00:16:16,700
right now, it is not like this. Just look at all that. You can't, you, you can't even move in here.

64
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:53,850
There's no room. There's just no room to move in here. I can't breathe in this room. Why are

65
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:57,929
all your socks on the bed? I kind of just seen what I needed to get them all out first before

66
00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:29,579
I put them away. I don't like this up here. This needs to be here. Okay. Now what? Why is there

67
00:17:29,579 --> 00:18:10,490
only one shoe? Towel? What is that? This is bag. A health kit. Don't act like you don't do that.

68
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:26,869
Don't act like you don't do that either. Don't act like you don't do that either. Quiet. Okay. I just

69
00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:38,630
gotta get stuff out of box first. This is toothpaste. This is a brush. I'm gonna put this here.

70
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:48,630
This is soap. We're gonna put it here. Although gross, gross, gross. I, no, I don't use that shit.

71
00:18:48,630 --> 00:19:06,839
I don't do that. Gross. Yeah. I don't, I don't smear around then lather up a big ball of

72
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:14,119
fucking bar soap, smear it all over my body and then place that shit on there for it to get like

73
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,599
stuck on. And even if you use a tray, it gets just stuck on the tray.

74
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:27,829
Bar soap is fucking dog shit. I'm sorry. It's dog shit. You just use a little bit of gel soap,

75
00:19:27,829 --> 00:19:36,940
a little bit of body wash, lather it up, scrub it up. I, you know, I actually like Irish spring

76
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:44,170
for one reason, because the guy in the commercial used to be like, this is the Irish spring and he

77
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:51,430
would be cutting it. He had a knife and he would be cutting the soap and he had a, it was an Irish

78
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:58,779
guy. So I was like, Oh wow. Irish spring. I thought it was actually from a, I thought it was like

79
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:05,750
from a really, really rare resource in Ireland. I don't believe, I don't think that now obviously,

80
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:12,150
but when I was younger, I really thought it was a rare thing. Oh, only from the finest of the Irish

81
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:24,970
springs. You fell for the ads. Yeah. When I was 12, 13, maybe 11, not like I was 20, 30 years old.

82
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:32,819
I thought it was some rare ingredients from some incredibly exotic place, like deep underground

83
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:50,089
and some spring and I don't know. This is like an espresso cup. How's the bathroom look? I don't

84
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:54,500
like this. In fact, I don't, I don't think I even want this in here. What do I want this?

85
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:00,490
Is this deodorant? And I guess that would sit here.

86
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:26,420
I'm okay with that. Towel. What are you doing? Washing the utensils first because they've been

87
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:42,380
in a box for probably a month. Is this, yeah, you put the bug stuff down here. This is George

88
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:51,819
Warman. Does it go down here too? No, it would be like here. There's a scale. Uh,

89
00:21:52,700 --> 00:22:07,000
put that here because it looks all right there. Pot. Put it up here. It's a cutting board. I know.

90
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:17,460
You think I didn't know? All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is,

91
00:22:21,829 --> 00:22:32,839
I thought, okay, this is not a poster. That's garbage bags, sponges, spatula. All right. Let's

92
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:40,380
get some stuff situated here. Toaster is going to go here. Is this a dishwashing soap? And then

93
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:48,779
what is this? Okay. This is hand soap, obviously. What is, pine saw? What is that? What is this?

94
00:22:49,420 --> 00:23:05,460
What's the difference? This is cooking oil. Oh, okay. Well, then it goes here. Cups. Cups

95
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:38,920
that go up here. Sugar. Put the spices and shit up here. Put the money away. I don't want to

96
00:23:38,920 --> 00:24:24,940
advertise like my money. Why would I do that? Glassware will go, um, shit. I don't want all

97
00:24:24,940 --> 00:25:03,980
this. What, like, what is all this stuff? Bingo. All right. Hold on. When am I going to put all

98
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:35,799
this? How am I going to reach this shit ever? I'm never going to be able to grab this stuff.

99
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:40,420
All right. Let's be honest. I'm only going to use this thing once a year. So let's put this stuff

100
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:54,220
down here that I don't need down here. What's wrong with this? I don't get it. What's the problem?

101
00:25:54,940 --> 00:26:16,980
What's the problem? I can't have towels out. What? I put my shoes at the door. I don't,

102
00:26:16,980 --> 00:27:26,579
what's the issue? All right, let's go. Let's take a look at speedrun. I was so zoomed in. Nice.

103
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:47,019
Very nice. 2007. Oh God. Okay. Oh goodness. I already have this bunch of shit over here.

104
00:27:47,019 --> 00:27:51,589
There's already stuff here. There's some shit here already. Can I throw some stuff away?

105
00:27:52,390 --> 00:28:01,059
I can't move anything else. I would just throw everything away. Well, I mean, I wouldn't,

106
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:05,539
but like in the game, I mean, I wouldn't just throw everything away. I'm just saying in the

107
00:28:05,539 --> 00:28:09,940
context of this video game, I would just get rid of the stuff so I could put new stuff out.

108
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:21,289
You have a roommate? That makes it even worse. Can you imagine coming in and your roommate has

109
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:28,200
five or six contractor trash bags full of stuff? Hey, what's it? What's in the bags?

110
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,039
Oh, nothing. I'm just making a couple trips to the dumpster. Not a big deal.

111
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:54,549
You throw every single thing they own away. Wow. That would be awful. That's a power move. What

112
00:28:54,630 --> 00:29:03,619
even is this? I don't know. Put it over here for now. Close. No, I gotta, we gotta, where's the

113
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:10,519
bedroom? Oh man. This is going to be so much of a pain in the ass. All right. I'm going to go fast.

114
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:22,500
I'm, I'm, I don't know. I can't pay attention to this. I can't do it. There's too much stuff.

115
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:28,069
I can't do it. I can't this. I, I don't care what to do with this thing. I don't want to

116
00:29:32,069 --> 00:29:37,269
put some effort into this guys. Every time I've moved, I really sit there and look at all my stuff

117
00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:42,869
and go, I just want to smash all this up with a hammer and the throne in the trash. I swear.

118
00:29:42,869 --> 00:29:55,299
Sometimes you just look around and you just like, fuck it. Fuck this. You don't do it,

119
00:29:55,299 --> 00:30:01,240
but you sit there and you have this, this thought of just, I really would love to put this all in

120
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:21,799
a trash compactor and just watch it get crushed. Okay. Where we need a box of the pans. Look at

121
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:28,940
all this. It's like, there's each, there's markers for each different like day of the week. This is

122
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:34,940
why I try not to own anything. I just, I, I want, I want just a, such a small amount of stuff.

123
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:41,660
I want the stuff that makes me, do I need it to survive? Yes. Okay. Toilet paper. You need that.

124
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:49,740
You need a rag, right? You need a good rag. You need stuff in the bathroom, a toothbrush. I don't

125
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:53,900
need all these books. I don't need all these things. I don't, I don't, I don't need all this other

126
00:30:53,900 --> 00:31:03,910
shit. I just, honestly, I just need a pan to cook food in. I just, you need to only need a few pans.

127
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:08,789
Sometimes you go to kitchens and the person's like a master fucking chef. They have

128
00:31:08,789 --> 00:31:15,400
15 different pans. It's like, do you even know the last time you even used that like extra large

129
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:30,150
wok? What, what, what do you mean? What? What's wrong with all this? You guys understand that this

130
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:38,599
is almost everything I own is in here and in that closet. This is almost every object that I own.

131
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:45,880
This is my whole life is this shelf here. All of my possessions are there and right there. I don't,

132
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:55,349
I don't like have anything else. I keep some consoles and some games and stuff. I have

133
00:31:55,910 --> 00:32:09,019
three or four pans. Couch. I got a VR headset. I don't know. I don't like stuff. I don't like

134
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:15,130
a bunch of stuff. Yeah. I don't know. I don't like stuff. Like for instance, to me, this is stuff.

135
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:20,329
This is stuff. This is, I would get rid of it. Let me tell you what would go in this room. You're

136
00:32:20,329 --> 00:32:28,519
ready. No, it's a book. Get rid of it. What am I going to write down? Alarm clock. Nope. I have a

137
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:34,440
phone. I don't need that. What is this? Some random magazine postcard. Put it on the fridge for six

138
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:39,690
months. After six months, have it lapsed. Take it off. Oh, you sent me a picture of, of, of like

139
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:43,609
your kids or something or like, Oh, something that like a cool thing. It's going on the fridge for

140
00:32:43,609 --> 00:32:51,299
six to 12 months and it's coming off. What's this? Another one. Nope. I wouldn't have any of this.

141
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:58,170
I have a phone and I don't even listen to music. So I don't need this. A hanger. You're going to

142
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:05,529
bring a hanger with you. Okay. No. What did you, what did somebody just said? Something about how

143
00:33:05,529 --> 00:33:22,150
I did. I lived out of a shoe. Like a lady from that nursery rhyme who lived in the shoe. What is this?

144
00:33:22,789 --> 00:33:38,700
I want to show you guys something. Cause it's very important. This is my mouse pad. You want to see

145
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:44,779
how I don't own anything. I don't care. This is my mouse pad. I've had, I've been using the same

146
00:33:44,779 --> 00:33:50,059
mouse pad for fucking almost 10 straight. This is a magic of wizard wars mouse pad. This is what I

147
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:57,400
use. I don't play this game. I don't give a shit about this game or this entire franchise. I don't

148
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:07,240
care. Magic of fucking wizard wars guys. I don't need anything else. I don't need another one.

149
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:15,590
Why would I get another one? What do I care? I've owned this since 2011. I think buy a new one. I

150
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:22,519
don't need a new one. This one works. This works just fine. It's just this floppy. Oh look, I'm

151
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:30,360
going to make thunder. I, I, you don't need, I don't need another one. If it were up to me,

152
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:39,500
I would just do it on my shin. I mean my thigh. If it worked, I used an Amazon basics keyboard

153
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:46,340
for five years. That thing was $9 on Amazon. I don't need stuff. I don't care about stuff.

154
00:34:46,980 --> 00:35:16,699
This thing probably smells. I'll be, I'll give you a real review. I promise. Um, it's just,

155
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:25,219
I don't know. It smells like the inside of a closet. It doesn't, it doesn't smell bad. It smells

156
00:35:25,219 --> 00:35:42,360
like whatever. Now I got to put this back over here. It stinks. No, it doesn't stink. It just

157
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:52,329
smells like fucking rubber. You should taste it. No, stop being childish. God's sake. Stop being

158
00:35:52,329 --> 00:35:57,530
so, all right. Now underneath here, for instance. Now that's gross. Now that's just not nice. I

159
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:03,059
clean this from a lot, but that's just, that's just, that's just not okay. That just looks bad.

160
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:12,059
You're used to the smell. What, you want me to breeze my mouse pad?

161
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:25,219
Guys, I have one other mouse pad. Give me a second. I need to see if I still have it.

162
00:36:25,219 --> 00:36:28,340
You're going to fucking shit your pants laughing if I can get it. I'm right back.

163
00:36:28,980 --> 00:37:00,469
I got it. I got it. Okay. Are you ready? Are you ready for me to reveal the other mouse pad that I

164
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:39,110
own? Okay. Here we go. It's a Superman holographic mouse pad. It's pretty cool. Should I use this

165
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:51,670
instead of the Magica Wizard Wars one? What do you think? Is this worth any money? Does it make a

166
00:37:51,670 --> 00:38:21,300
sound when you scratch it? What the fuck? It's been a rough day today. Everybody shut up. You're

167
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:35,500
ruining the surface. That's the only other mouse pad I own. I just don't care. I don't care. I don't

168
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:42,219
own stuff. I, I get, look, I would, I will spend money on, on things that are very essential that

169
00:38:42,300 --> 00:39:03,019
I find essential. For instance, a nice fucking meal. Nice fucking delicious meal. I have McDonald's.

170
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:14,920
Not at McDonald's. Superman mouse pad is essential. You're acting like I bought this recently.

171
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:31,130
Yeah. I, I, I don't, I don't even know where I got it. You eat McDonald's and shit.

172
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:41,510
Just because I eat McDonald's doesn't mean that's the only food I eat. Oh, I like McDonald's. You

173
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:46,789
eat it three meals a day, every single fucking day. It's not what I said. I just said I enjoy

174
00:39:46,789 --> 00:40:03,960
that restaurant. All right. What, I gotta get this, I gotta, hold on. This is some kind of

175
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:14,710
tablet or something. Why do I not have the thing to put this on? Why is it? Wait, I'll make it,

176
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:19,030
you know, here's the idea. You put it that far away. So then when it actually beeps, you have

177
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:22,710
to get up and climb up the shit to turn it off. So you, you make sure you're going to get up for it.

178
00:40:23,349 --> 00:40:49,929
This is all wrong. All wrong. Maybe you didn't have so much bullshit. Where the fuck am I

179
00:40:50,010 --> 00:41:00,260
supposed to put all this shit? Why do I have business cards out on my own desk? I know who I am.

180
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:41,800
Put these away. So many books. Oh, just get the digital one. Too many books. Too many books.

181
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:53,510
How come there's no end table or anything? Am I going to put all my stuff on the ground?

182
00:41:54,230 --> 00:42:49,480
Take the other side. Okay, whatever. Bottoms are going here. Tops go in there. And then underwear

183
00:42:49,480 --> 00:43:01,300
is going in here. A lot of pain in the ass. Oh, this hurts me. Oh, I just hate it.

184
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:42,550
Okay, thank God. I hate it. I hate it. Oh, get this out. Throw them away. This is going

185
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:49,909
to somewhere else. Look at all the stuff we have. You understand that we probably had

186
00:43:50,469 --> 00:43:55,829
20 more encyclopedias, but they're being taken up by like Crunchy the Cockroach.

187
00:43:56,469 --> 00:44:18,820
Like a bunch of action figures. This can go back here. Come on, get back there. Can I go under the

188
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:41,559
bed? That's not a bad place for it. Good, good, good. Feels good. The worst possible place to

189
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:48,840
put a tower because you can't ever touch the back of it. I hate this. I have my tower right here

190
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,880
and it's not enclosed by a bunch of this shit and I still hate it.

191
00:44:52,840 --> 00:45:24,300
What's that? Frisbee? Hey, leave that under there for like 10 years. Is that a shoe? What is this?

192
00:45:25,179 --> 00:45:40,070
That's a squished up shoe. Is that a paint can? What is this? Honest to God, what is this? This

193
00:45:40,070 --> 00:46:01,079
looks like a Ghostbuster trap. What is this thing? What is that? It's climbing chalk? Chalk bag for

194
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:51,639
climbing. Okay. No, get back here. There's not enough room in this closet. There's no fucking room

195
00:46:51,639 --> 00:47:19,300
in this goddamn closet. That's the, that's a pants hanger. What is this? A yoga mat or something?

196
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:38,869
This was so small when I took it out, I thought it was a Pez container. This is a trash can.

197
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,019
Yeah, good luck throwing one item in here and then needing to take the whole bag out.

198
00:47:45,820 --> 00:48:15,880
This is all fucked up. This is, look at all fucked up. This is, this is fucked up. Look at all the

199
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:32,199
stuff on the desk. Alright, looking good so far. Not bad. Okay. Dining room. More books.

200
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:44,329
Let's be, let's be realistic with ourselves here. Everybody that has all these books,

201
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:51,530
they buy them. They like open them in bed and they read three pages and they close it and they just

202
00:48:51,530 --> 00:49:16,199
pretend like they're reading it. I knew for a fact that was going to get somebody. People are just

203
00:49:16,199 --> 00:50:11,429
like, I fucking read. What is he saying? Oh, back to the living room. Alright. I would never do this.

204
00:50:11,429 --> 00:50:17,130
This is stupid. There's already a visual here for the television for you to look at. So putting

205
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:24,730
another visual right behind it is, that's dog shit feng shui. That's bad. This is no, because

206
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:45,980
there's another visual right behind it. This is going somewhere else. Too many visuals. Is that

207
00:50:45,980 --> 00:51:35,059
GameCube? I hear the games. Let's get the games over here. A little blanket. Cool. All the vents

208
00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:55,099
are blocked. Oh my god, look at this shit. Um, too much stuff. There's another thing I don't know

209
00:51:55,099 --> 00:52:03,829
what to do with. Okay, I'm gonna take this down. Put these, can these fit up here? That can. Too

210
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:20,010
many things. That works. Alright, that works. I can sit under there. Alright, kitchen. More mugs.

211
00:52:22,179 --> 00:52:34,469
Towel. Mug. I've been drinking out of the same coffee cups for five to ten years too.

212
00:52:37,260 --> 00:53:03,719
Guys have a problem with that? Yeah, as long as you wash it. Oh yeah, of course I do. What is this?

213
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:26,099
Oh, it's a magnet. Have you been shitting out of the same ass? Yes. What a weird, what a weirdo.

214
00:53:27,860 --> 00:54:17,690
Organized. This can't fit in there. Whatever. Medic kit. Sponges. Spatula. Spoon. Cutting board.

215
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:22,659
Alright, I think this is like a towel. This is going in the other, this is gonna bathroom.

216
00:54:27,159 --> 00:54:38,010
Towel. Alright, toothbrush. I'm not putting my toothbrush up here. This is coming with me in the

217
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:49,320
bedroom. This is coming with me in the bedroom. No, I'm sorry. I don't know. I don't know. I don't

218
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:53,980
like to, I don't want to leave my shit up. When I'm done brushing my teeth, this is getting put in a

219
00:54:53,980 --> 00:55:31,219
little plastic bag and I'm bringing it into my bedroom. Putting it in a drawer. Holy shit, look

220
00:55:31,219 --> 00:56:01,320
at these. Those are Costco. Those are bulk. Damn. Spray. That's horse shampoo. How much shit does

221
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:23,079
this person have? That, thank you for saying that. Thank you. Alright, so what's the problem?

222
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:30,230
All of this apparently shouldn't be here. Where else are they supposed to go? Put it, you gotta

223
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:38,980
put your clothes away. You gotta put your shoes away. Put your shoes away. No. Actually, my shoes

224
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:50,860
are at just the front door of wherever you live. They're just at the front. I'm not putting these

225
00:56:50,860 --> 00:57:02,889
all in here. They're just at the front door and these can't even fit. Yeah, that's good.

226
00:57:07,159 --> 00:57:11,190
This looks good. What's up? Is there a problem? Kitchen's a problem. For what?

227
00:57:13,059 --> 00:57:20,039
Oh, sorry. My mistake. There were two towels on the counter. I'm so sorry. I will fix this

228
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:30,860
immediately. God, what a bonehead. What a dumb, what an idiot. Forget about all the dirty fucking

229
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:40,380
dishes in the sink or all the other bullshit that's up here. Let's see the speed run.

230
00:57:41,099 --> 00:58:14,280
Okay, so am I just really doing this? Am I doing the same speed? Am I just weirdly

231
00:58:15,239 --> 00:58:18,280
consistent with how fast I did this? Or is it just going to put it out no matter what?

232
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:44,460
Hey, you don't watch a spider make its web. You just see the end result. So please

233
00:58:45,179 --> 00:59:10,179
spare me the criticisms. Those just jumped around on their own. How do I get a better view?

234
00:59:11,139 --> 01:00:01,639
There's two zoomed in. Hey, remember this rant? God, it's like it was yesterday. 2010. Okay,

235
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:29,659
what is that? Oh, what is it? Pet bug? I can move everything. Is this mine? Why can I move

236
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:36,519
the guitars and TV and the dumbbells? Whatever. Okay, what we got? I have to make sure everybody

237
01:00:36,519 --> 01:00:40,199
knows that I play D&D. It's the first thing that I want them to see so I can have an hour long

238
01:00:40,199 --> 01:00:49,579
conversation with them about D&D. They go, Hey, man, what's this thing? Oh, well, let me tell you

239
01:00:49,579 --> 01:01:16,260
something about Dungeons and Dragons. How much time do you have? It's like a mini ukulele. Oh,

240
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:31,989
wow. Look at this. We've got a super closet now. Perfect place for my shirts. Who's this messy

241
01:01:31,989 --> 01:01:42,090
person? Look at this messy bullshit. It's not a bowling alley. Okay. Symmetrical and flush.

242
01:01:52,539 --> 01:02:09,019
It's messy. Just rip these doors off. Just take these doors off. All they do is just cause a

243
01:02:09,019 --> 01:02:15,980
huge problem. They're a massive pain in the ass. Those of you that have ever had to use these doors

244
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:21,179
before. Fuck these things. They come off the first day I move in. I don't care. Without a doubt.

245
01:02:24,739 --> 01:02:49,190
First day. Of course, gonna bring my Game Boy everywhere I go. Those are cigarettes.

246
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:17,000
What is it? Why do you have these? Oh, how much underwear? Is this underwear? How much

247
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:25,300
underwear do we have? This is kind of a lot of underwear. Are we planning on shitting our pants

248
01:03:25,300 --> 01:04:00,300
a lot? Are these socks? Are these socks or is it underwear? It's both. What are these?

249
01:04:01,019 --> 01:04:05,460
Get these fucking fruit roll-ups out of here. These ties, I think, right?

250
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:27,380
Game's gonna get mad at me for putting the shoes in the wrong place.

251
01:04:51,610 --> 01:04:55,610
Just grab them and like the Hulk rip them off. I hate these things so much.

252
01:05:11,269 --> 01:05:20,760
What am I supposed to do with this? I don't do what this is like. Degree? What am I supposed

253
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:25,980
to do with this? I don't, there's nowhere for me to hang this. I'm just gonna put my degree in

254
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:55,019
the bathroom. I don't care. That's where it belongs. These shoes are all mismatched. I don't care.

255
01:05:55,659 --> 01:06:13,769
It doesn't belong. All right, let me take these markers. I think

256
01:06:14,409 --> 01:06:37,940
put these back here. Look at this mess of a living room. Come on. I brought these everywhere.

257
01:06:37,940 --> 01:07:17,820
Too many books. That just really is. I'm sorry. I know that like a lot of people like books and

258
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:32,730
stuff so that I don't like books. I just they take up a lot of space. It's just too much shit.

259
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:45,780
This is important though. I would say this is very important. That's the most important thing

260
01:07:45,780 --> 01:08:02,090
that I've packed is the chicken thing. And this, I don't, let's put this in the bedroom.

261
01:08:02,090 --> 01:08:16,100
If I could move it, I would. Look at all these. What the fuck are these all for?

262
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:24,859
Why has that many of those? This is bullshit. Everybody that owns more than one of these,

263
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:33,260
you go, you fan, you see five to 10 pages with shit on it. The rest is empty. And it's like that

264
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:41,939
across every single one of them. You don't need all these. The first five pages have stuff on this

265
01:08:41,939 --> 01:08:53,939
and the rest is blank. There's sketchbooks. There's a lot. You don't know how to read.

266
01:08:53,939 --> 01:09:10,550
You don't know how art works. It's an artist. But I mean, it's a lot of books. Look at all these

267
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:18,810
large cheese pizzas that I have to put across my whole house. Think about that. I have to find room

268
01:09:18,810 --> 01:09:44,390
for like 25 pizza hut boxes. And by the way, how dare you be this talented? How dare you be

269
01:09:44,390 --> 01:10:00,979
this talented to have that much material? There's another pizza. I don't know where

270
01:10:00,979 --> 01:10:23,960
to put this other pizza. Here comes a backpedal. Do you guys hear that? What the fuck was that?

271
01:10:24,600 --> 01:11:01,560
That sound was coming from my speaker. It was weird. Yeah. What time is it? Six 23. Nine.

272
01:11:02,199 --> 01:11:19,140
What? I'm so confused. I'm sorry, but this is a GameCube house. We're gonna put this one,

273
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:40,619
we're gonna put this one in the closet. I don't fucking want this thing. I just get rid, I don't

274
01:11:40,619 --> 01:12:22,710
care. Okay. Cookies important. Measuring tablespoons. What was that? Molasses. Oil. Oil.

275
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:50,149
Garlic powder. Thyme. Has this one been here for more than six months? I gotta, is there a place I

276
01:12:50,149 --> 01:13:03,260
can put this? What even is this? Is this leftovers? Why do I have like takeout still? Throw this away.

277
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:17,819
All right. Salt and pepper gonna be on the table. Is this coffee? I think. Whatever. What is this?

278
01:13:17,819 --> 01:13:23,750
It was a marijuana scale. What are you doing? What is this? Why is this here? What is this for?

279
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:43,399
Is this a juicer? It's a cooking scale? By a show of hands, one being yes, two being no.

280
01:13:44,039 --> 01:13:50,199
Do you have a cooking scale in your house? And do you have you used it? One is yes. Two is no.

281
01:13:50,279 --> 01:13:57,640
Fucking liars. No way. Liars. Lie. Lie. Lie. I see a liars. I don't see anything but liars.

282
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,600
You've used, you use one of these on a regular cooking scale?

283
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:13,829
I have, I have never like sprinkled shit on a cooking scale and weighed it out to exact. No,

284
01:14:13,829 --> 01:14:31,930
you just eyeball that shit. It's not for cooking. It's for baking. But just follow the recipe.

285
01:14:33,529 --> 01:14:43,109
I need one tablespoon of baking soda. Here it is. I don't, do I need to put that on the scale?

286
01:14:54,649 --> 01:15:00,010
Do you cook often? I do cook, but I don't, I don't like weigh my fucking cheeseburger patties on a

287
01:15:00,010 --> 01:15:12,840
marijuana weed scale. I've never heard of people doing this. Yeah, guys, I make like turkey

288
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:18,359
sandwiches. I don't weigh the deli meat and go, I had to make sure I have at least 0.2 grams of

289
01:15:18,359 --> 01:15:23,399
turkey meat. I make eggs. I don't, I just crack the eggs in the pan and fucking eat them.

290
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:29,739
If I'm going to be baking, I just bake cookies. I don't need to, what am I weighing? What am

291
01:15:29,739 --> 01:15:36,699
I weighing it for? What's it for? That's not cooking. If I bake salmon in the oven,

292
01:15:37,579 --> 01:15:48,500
I don't need to weigh, what am I, what am I using it for? Dude, it's sad what you're saying.

293
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:59,770
Volumetric baking. Okay, but, but if you don't bake, you don't need one of these.

294
01:16:00,729 --> 01:16:06,010
I just like making pasta is pasta. Making a salad, I just make the salad. I just cut up some tomatoes

295
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:10,250
and fucking onions, red onions, swirl it around, put it in the thing, press the button so it spins,

296
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:15,609
spins, spins, spins, spins like a merry-go-round. I would put, I'm going to put a whole turkey in

297
01:16:15,609 --> 01:16:28,539
the oven. You just put a turkey in the oven. It's for baking recipes. I don't, I don't bake.

298
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:38,060
A lot of, I don't bake. What I do is I shave onions into the pan, mushrooms, chop up the

299
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:41,659
mushrooms, chop the onions up, get it in there, swirl it around, swivel it around,

300
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:47,050
put a little bit of oil in there, cook up the mushrooms and onions, get those cooked out to

301
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:51,130
perfection, make them nice and caramelized, put them over on the other side, put the steak in there,

302
01:16:53,579 --> 01:17:04,119
two minutes, two minutes, put that on top, a little bit of A1, chop salad, chop it up.

303
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:12,890
I'm not weighing that. All right, you're distracting me.

304
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:32,020
Yeah, Derma A1, get it. Bang, I've been wanting to talk about this for like a week,

305
01:17:32,819 --> 01:17:40,869
two, maybe three weeks. Guys, Five Guys is 100 times better than Shake Shack,

306
01:17:41,909 --> 01:17:47,560
a hundred fucking times better. I don't know what happened, and I'm going to be really honest with

307
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:57,659
you, Five Guys fell off for me five years ago or so. Shake Shack was number one, best ever.

308
01:17:57,659 --> 01:18:03,979
Number one, best ever. I'm telling you right now, Five Guys has improved in quality,

309
01:18:03,979 --> 01:18:08,699
while Shake Shack has gone way fucking down in quality. Five Guys is now all the way up at

310
01:18:08,699 --> 01:18:14,899
the top. They are number one for me. Seriously, I'm not kidding. I don't know what happened over the

311
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:22,869
last four or five years. Shake Shack, I have to be honest, this is just a review of that restaurant.

312
01:18:22,869 --> 01:18:29,050
It sucks. It sucks now. What happened? Why? What happened? I don't know what happened.

313
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:37,979
I've had Shake Shack from more than one location, more than a few locations. It was kind of bad.

314
01:18:39,739 --> 01:18:46,220
It really wasn't that... Okay, I got lettuce on a Shake Shack burger, and I'm not... I wish I took

315
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:52,380
a picture of it because it was fucking ridiculous. It was one tiny, wilted, small, thin piece of

316
01:18:52,380 --> 01:19:01,619
wilted, wet, gross lettuce. I have to be honest with you. I went to Five Guys and I got lettuce,

317
01:19:01,619 --> 01:19:07,560
and it was this crunchy, crispy, like... It was packed full of flavor and juices and stuff.

318
01:19:09,369 --> 01:19:15,479
Oh my God, it was so good. And I used to think Shake Shack was the best. And I thought that Five

319
01:19:15,479 --> 01:19:20,439
Guys was okay, but something happened in the last few years. It's probably the best takeout burger.

320
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:27,529
The tomato, if I were to have it, which I don't have it on my burgers, but if I did,

321
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:32,380
so crunchy and so just full of just juicy, delicious, fresh flavor.

322
01:19:34,699 --> 01:19:51,560
They flipped. I just put it under the fucking bed. I don't care.

323
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:59,399
What do we do with these controllers? We have too many systems. What do these even go... Okay,

324
01:19:59,399 --> 01:20:08,699
four is actually not a bad amount. Oh, we have two systems. Okay.

325
01:20:10,859 --> 01:20:29,640
What is this? What are these things? What do I do with this record player?

326
01:20:31,079 --> 01:20:44,359
Just keep... Everyone puts in my hair anyways. It's fine. But seriously, Five Guys, I don't know

327
01:20:44,359 --> 01:21:06,600
what you did. The burgers are fucking on point. Better than anywhere else. Oh, not very much

328
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:19,640
storage. You know what I mean? Like, I don't... Where am I supposed to put this? There's way too

329
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:28,760
much stuff on the counter. Are you supposed to prepare food on this counter? You better be

330
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:32,279
throwing pizzas in the air because there's nothing... You're not going to have any room for anything.

331
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:42,579
I don't know what to do with that toothbrush. Let's go. Nail clipper. Let's go.

332
01:22:44,010 --> 01:24:53,720
Shave and razor. Let's go. Mug. Hair gel. Febreze. Medicine. My god, what is all this? What the...

333
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:59,399
Rich streamer has never unpacked in his life. He gets his man servants to do it for him.

334
01:25:02,119 --> 01:25:14,100
No, that's not accurate. That's not accurate. I just don't care about other people's stuff.

335
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:20,199
This is not my stuff. This is not my stuff, so I don't care. I don't care about your dumb green

336
01:25:20,199 --> 01:25:24,199
toaster, all right? If this was my toaster, I would want to know where... I would want to

337
01:25:24,199 --> 01:25:37,859
put it somewhere special. What's a razor doing in here? There's no room for anything. Where is

338
01:25:37,859 --> 01:25:56,420
the Febreze supposed to go? Why is this so... Why is everything so wrong? There's no... There's no

339
01:25:56,420 --> 01:26:05,319
where to put... I can't put anything anywhere. A Febreze goes in any room, okay? I don't understand.

340
01:26:05,319 --> 01:26:09,960
This is stupid to me because considering... Like, how many times have you fought it in a room

341
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:16,859
and, holy shit, you hear somebody walking down the hallway, like, I don't know, your girlfriend,

342
01:26:17,819 --> 01:26:23,899
like, you know, a few days ago, and you hear the footsteps and you just laid out a fucking gross

343
01:26:23,899 --> 01:26:34,060
one. And if there was one in the bedroom right there... Done. It's for any room. It's literally

344
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:41,850
for any room. There's no room it has to be in. Oh, he fought it. Yeah, that's funny. Where does it

345
01:26:41,850 --> 01:26:47,210
want me to put this? Does anybody have any idea where this... Where does it want this to go?

346
01:26:48,250 --> 01:27:33,020
Where does it want this to go? I can't even put this anywhere. Why can't I leave it where it was?

347
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:54,329
I can't put it anywhere. What do I do with this? This is a laptop. How is this place worse than

348
01:27:54,329 --> 01:28:08,489
the last one? There's less room than the last one. Where's it supposed to go? What am I supposed...

349
01:28:08,489 --> 01:28:18,550
What the fuck am I supposed to do with this? Are you missing another room? I don't think so. The

350
01:28:18,550 --> 01:28:28,340
side table? Well, that makes sense, okay. But what about the Etch A Sketch? I would think, like,

351
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:50,699
right here, right? No. I don't even have a desk. I don't have a desk. I've got plenty of fucking

352
01:28:50,699 --> 01:30:20,069
underwear. Where's the desk? Throw it into the river. Piece of shit. This one's good. We're good.

353
01:30:20,069 --> 01:30:23,909
What am I supposed... I don't understand what it wants me to do with these. They can't go anywhere.

354
01:30:23,909 --> 01:31:29,050
I can't put them up anywhere. How is this not on the right spot? Why? On the coffee table in the

355
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:38,250
living room? That's kind of in the way. That takes up a... That's in the way, right? Am I crazy?

356
01:32:00,899 --> 01:32:31,189
Fuck. I don't care. What's wrong with these? Okay, that looks all right. All the weird...

357
01:32:32,069 --> 01:32:39,479
I would put them over here in a place to store them. I think that's good. All right, now we just

358
01:32:39,479 --> 01:33:02,170
need to fix the bedroom. Right. My degree, which I don't know where it wants me to put it. Under the

359
01:33:02,170 --> 01:33:55,430
bed. Under the bed? Is it supposed to be sad? I was just picking it up and putting it down for,

360
01:33:55,430 --> 01:34:42,729
like, a fucking full five minutes. Jesus. I'm just angry. I feel so serious moving into his

361
01:34:42,729 --> 01:35:32,090
place. All right, so now what? 2012. What's this? What am I doing here? One pound weights.

362
01:35:32,250 --> 01:36:01,289
Oh, we got a DS? No, we don't have just a Game Boy Advance DS. I can stay here, I think. On the bed,

363
01:36:01,289 --> 01:37:14,939
maybe. There it is. I'm putting the degree back up. What is this? These cartridges? That's better.

364
01:37:15,739 --> 01:38:03,029
What is that? Why do you look so scary? I don't know, man. The light is on me.

365
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:46,760
Medkit. All right. Okay. He looks a bit scary. What the fuck are you talking about?

366
01:38:47,479 --> 01:39:12,489
What are you talking about? I'm just sitting here. Yo, he does look a bit scary. All right,

367
01:39:12,489 --> 01:39:50,010
that was a quick one. What's wrong with my eyes? What's wrong with this? Why do I have to take this

368
01:39:50,010 --> 01:40:19,510
off? Throw it away. That's a way, right? Oh, I got it. Don't piss him off, guys. He'll yell again.

369
01:40:19,510 --> 01:40:47,500
I'm not going to yell. This room used to feel bigger. Game's not even hard. Give me a fucking

370
01:40:47,500 --> 01:41:12,630
challenge. 2013. That's a big one. All right, how fast do you think I can do it? You know,

371
01:41:12,630 --> 01:41:18,489
I was just told if you really want to make moving around and opening boxes and putting stuff on

372
01:41:18,489 --> 01:42:53,989
shelves and stuff, do it to a song. Isn't it fun? Okay, so I got everything out of the boxes. You

373
01:42:53,989 --> 01:43:14,869
can do the rest. I'll be back. Why is there a cane? Am I old? All right, let me rethink this,

374
01:43:14,869 --> 01:43:40,170
because obviously that was just, wow, laughing out fucking loud. I've always put these things

375
01:43:40,170 --> 01:43:58,119
at the highest possible level. All the video games going on the bottom shelf. It's just easier

376
01:43:58,119 --> 01:44:23,699
to keep track of. Any more stray video games? Yep. Perfect. Oh, I want the chickens in the bedroom.

377
01:44:23,699 --> 01:44:46,979
Was it a DVD player? Yep. Sort them by console. No, you sort them by time played. Not by console,

378
01:44:46,979 --> 01:44:51,399
but there's a bug in here. Where is it? That was weird. No, it wasn't. It was a floating piece

379
01:44:51,399 --> 01:44:58,020
of dust. That was fucking terrifying. It just swooped into my... That was weird. It's by time

380
01:44:58,020 --> 01:45:26,659
played. On what game? I'm sorry. That's the way it is. I don't know what that is. Okay. Frog.

381
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:41,609
You can sit over here. I want the chickens in the bedroom. What's the fastest way to get them over

382
01:45:41,609 --> 01:46:08,539
there? This is gonna look really stupid when we see the fast motion one. The ukulele has a stand?

383
01:46:11,739 --> 01:46:17,340
Where? That's a ukulele stand? I thought that was just like a piece of woodworking. I didn't

384
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:24,140
think it actually had a purpose. I thought that was just a piece of art. I didn't know that it

385
01:46:24,140 --> 01:46:44,250
actually had a purpose. Okay, it does. Not bad. Oh, no. No, thanks. I'll do the computer room.

386
01:46:44,250 --> 01:47:16,710
There's gonna be so many books. There's gonna be so many books. I'm not just talking about these.

387
01:47:16,710 --> 01:47:51,060
I'm talking about these two. I'm talking about just all the books. What's that? Blanket. Laptop.

388
01:47:55,300 --> 01:48:53,560
Tablet. Book. Book. Book. Book. Whale. Two whales. What the fuck? You have so many of these.

389
01:48:54,439 --> 01:49:20,899
I'm a fax machine? Cods. Wi-Fi router. Clock. All right, let's organize this, please.

390
01:49:37,590 --> 01:49:52,729
I don't know. I don't even know what these are. What is this? What is this thing? That's a scanner

391
01:49:52,729 --> 01:50:00,550
and printer. What is this? Printer and scanner? So I have a scanner-printer combo and then a printer-

392
01:50:00,550 --> 01:50:08,550
scanner combo. Why are they detached? What year is this supposed to be? They were connected always

393
01:50:08,550 --> 01:50:20,310
for like the last 10 years. Printer-scanner combos existed since like 2005.

394
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:28,300
One is the scanner, one is the printer. Well, printer-scanner combos were- yeah,

395
01:50:28,300 --> 01:50:40,539
they existed in 2013. Yes, they did. Yes, they did. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Yes, they did.

396
01:50:40,539 --> 01:52:32,310
La, la, la, la. Those individual cookies? Oh, they're coasters. All right. Oh, a curveball.

397
01:52:32,310 --> 01:53:41,539
One of the reasons why I just- I know that, oh, you have a bunch of spices in your spice rack.

398
01:53:42,100 --> 01:53:50,090
I kind of just want to consolidate them all into one bottle. Does that make sense? Just combine

399
01:53:50,090 --> 01:53:53,609
half the spices I have into one fucking bottle because it's all going on anyways.

400
01:53:54,170 --> 01:55:13,590
Come on, I can fit the strainer in here. How does it not fit in there? You can't be serious, right?

401
01:55:14,619 --> 01:55:21,529
Oh, shut up. Stop. No, stop it. What are you doing? What are you doing in my wellington? Stop it.

402
01:55:23,880 --> 01:56:07,460
Stop. What are you doing? I'll figure it out later, whatever. That's good. Do you drink oil? No,

403
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:32,869
I put olive oil in a lot of foods though. That's really good. Don't say that. You can only microwave

404
01:56:32,869 --> 01:57:32,390
ramen noodles? That's not even true, man. So there it is finally. It only took like two hours to get

405
01:57:32,390 --> 01:58:58,140
to the scale. What the hell is that? It's a linen ball. What is this? Oh, okay. What is this? This

406
01:58:58,140 --> 01:59:13,689
looks all right. All right. This is going to be fun to wear. Little books. I'm just putting the

407
01:59:13,689 --> 01:59:20,890
books right here. I'm going to put every book over there and I'll figure it out later. All shirts,

408
01:59:20,890 --> 01:59:54,470
all pants are going over here. Whatever the hell this thing is. Okay. I love how seriously he's

409
01:59:54,470 --> 02:00:05,020
taking this. Yeah, I am. I mean, I'm taking it dead seriously. All right. Get the other box open.

410
02:00:05,020 --> 02:01:21,909
I got to make sure I get this right. I don't want to screw this up. Candle. Put the hangers up.

411
02:01:21,909 --> 02:01:32,090
I'm concentrating. There's just no order here. That doesn't have to be. I operate in chaos.

412
02:02:09,909 --> 02:02:40,619
What happened? Nothing. Is there another bedroom? No. Okay. Some of this shit's wrong. I wanted to

413
02:02:40,619 --> 02:02:54,550
get the Wi-Fi router out of the way. How's that wrong? The microwave can't be over here.

414
02:02:54,550 --> 02:02:59,829
So where else is it supposed to go? Where would you want me to put the microwave here?

415
02:02:59,829 --> 02:03:06,140
There's no room for it. How is this supposed to go anywhere? Now where's the toaster go?

416
02:03:07,020 --> 02:03:57,140
Where's the toaster supposed to go now? How is it wrong? It's a fucking towel. This is right.

417
02:03:57,140 --> 02:04:25,460
What's wrong here? This bedroom has something wrong. Oh, book. Got it. I thought this was

418
02:04:25,460 --> 02:05:01,670
the Sims for one second. That looks good. This hurt my neck. This game's really fun.

419
02:05:01,670 --> 02:05:05,289
There's something about it. I don't know. I'm not really talking that much, but I'm just kind of

420
02:05:06,090 --> 02:05:20,439
having a good time. I'm just enjoying it. You manipulated too much. Not really. Maybe a little.

421
02:05:22,060 --> 02:05:57,880
2015. Now what? What? Is this the same place? Oh, these are cute. Those are cute.

422
02:06:00,170 --> 02:06:15,479
Those are coasters. I want those. Those are cute. They actually really are. They don't

423
02:06:16,279 --> 02:07:16,300
don't act like you don't think it is. I love these. I really do. Get them some fruit coasters.

424
02:07:16,300 --> 02:07:22,060
I would love them. I'm probably going to get them. I'm probably going to go get the fruit coasters

425
02:07:22,060 --> 02:07:38,939
wherever I can get them. These are comfy. This is comfy. I like this. What are these little games?

426
02:07:38,939 --> 02:08:05,159
I got no room for these. Whoa. Book. Book. Book. I don't care. I don't read. I really don't.

427
02:08:05,800 --> 02:08:11,159
Does the living room door just go to the outside? Yeah, I think it's an apartment.

428
02:08:19,050 --> 02:08:29,210
This is done. All my shit is here. Oh, wait. I'm adding more. I understand now. I was like,

429
02:08:29,210 --> 02:09:29,659
wait, what the hell am I doing? I get it. I'm just mixing up all the clothes.

430
02:09:30,460 --> 02:09:35,100
I'm mixing up all of the clothes. I'm just putting them in random places. I'm not even...

431
02:09:36,760 --> 02:10:30,789
Whatever. What is that? Are these walkie talkies? What do I do with this? What is that? All right,

432
02:10:30,789 --> 02:10:45,340
close all this up. I can't see. Where do I put this? There's not enough room in the closet to

433
02:10:45,340 --> 02:11:05,899
put this. These have to go into the bed or something. Have you filed as a furry for tax

434
02:11:05,899 --> 02:11:51,029
purposes? I think you... Okay, this looks all right. Kitchen needs a little bit more stuff.

435
02:11:51,029 --> 02:11:57,180
Put this up on the sill. All right, this is where it gets... It's going to get hard here.

436
02:11:57,180 --> 02:12:17,510
It actually is. Cups out. A gigantic cheese grater? I don't... What is this? What is this?

437
02:12:19,510 --> 02:12:24,539
What is that? A juicer? We don't need a juicer. We don't need one of these.

438
02:12:25,500 --> 02:13:11,270
Ice cream scoop. That's a great addition, actually. Okay, these go this top. I mean,

439
02:13:11,350 --> 02:13:19,979
that has to... I don't... Put this. What do I do with this? There's no counter space.

440
02:13:20,699 --> 02:13:43,020
There's no space to put anything. All right, it's gonna have to do for now. I'll figure it out later.

441
02:14:00,710 --> 02:14:05,510
There's not enough room. We don't have enough room. There's not enough room for all this.

442
02:14:06,619 --> 02:14:13,930
I don't have enough room for all these salves. These gels. I don't have enough room for them.

443
02:14:16,760 --> 02:14:51,380
This is too... I don't have enough space. Okay, towels can go over here. Bath mat. Look at this

444
02:14:51,380 --> 02:15:12,569
countertop. This countertop is a mess. Oh, man. Wait, do we have... Are we gonna be on the walkie

445
02:15:12,569 --> 02:15:36,890
talkies next to each other? What are the walkie talkies for? It's cute. It's fun. What is this

446
02:15:36,890 --> 02:16:24,600
thing? I don't know what it wants me to do with that. What? What? Plants. What do I put this?

447
02:16:25,239 --> 02:16:47,340
You know what's gonna... I'm gonna knock this over. If this is on my bedside, I'm gonna have a bottle

448
02:16:47,340 --> 02:16:51,739
of water or something here and I'm gonna go reach to get the bottle of water and it's gonna annoy me

449
02:16:51,739 --> 02:17:04,780
and I'm gonna knock the plant over. All right, what do I do with this thing? Can this fit in here

450
02:17:04,780 --> 02:17:25,139
anywhere? There we go. I can't just go on the bed. There's a book in here. Get this book out of here.

451
02:17:36,540 --> 02:17:54,250
Oh my god. What the fuck? There's so much shit in this room. If I abuse this desk, I'm gonna have a

452
02:17:54,250 --> 02:18:16,090
fucking heart attack. Look at this. I can't even move. I can't exist in this room. Okay, got it.

453
02:18:17,340 --> 02:18:50,760
Kitchen. Where do I put this? I am like throwing this across. I'm throwing this in the trash from

454
02:18:50,760 --> 02:19:31,290
across the room right now. What do you don't like about this? I got it. The wooden thing? Is it a

455
02:19:31,290 --> 02:19:36,250
relaxing game? Ah, it is. This is kind of... This is a little shitty. This was not a good one, I will

456
02:19:36,250 --> 02:19:55,350
say. This wasn't a great one. If my nine-year-old sister was playing this yesterday, she was doing

457
02:19:55,350 --> 02:20:58,600
better than you. How long did it take her to place one object? 2018. This place is huge. Nice. Nice.

458
02:20:59,590 --> 02:21:21,780
Nice. First try. I'm getting this absolutely first try. Look at that placement already. We're good.

459
02:21:21,780 --> 02:21:41,989
Let's take this up to the bathroom. Bingo. Check it out. Hand sanitizer. A bowl of fruit. Another

460
02:21:41,989 --> 02:22:18,729
towel. Easy. Done deal. All right, this is a books. I'm gonna decorate up here. Okay, looks good.

461
02:22:18,729 --> 02:23:29,940
I mean, put the baby toys in the baby bed, right? Some cream. Looks good. The ba- what? It might be

462
02:23:29,940 --> 02:23:37,799
a little excessive, I agree. But I'm just barely... I'm barely... I'm barely functioning. I'm just

463
02:23:38,200 --> 02:23:43,930
figuring it out. I'm getting it all in the same spot so I know where to put it. And this is not

464
02:23:43,930 --> 02:24:48,540
going to be the end result. Okay, where should I put this? Look at all this baby stuff. I'm realizing

465
02:24:48,540 --> 02:24:54,600
what happened. And I'm a little embarrassed, but whatever. I'm putting the clothes on the bookshelf

466
02:24:54,600 --> 02:25:05,219
and the books on the clothes rack. This is what... I don't care. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

467
02:25:05,219 --> 02:25:14,139
It's fine. Too many plants. I- no, too many- there are too many plants. There are way too many

468
02:25:14,139 --> 02:26:21,719
plants. I'm just gonna be honest with you. Do you have too many plants? What? I fucking hate this

469
02:26:21,719 --> 02:26:32,229
box. This box has been a pain in the ass at every single level. I hate this thing. I- I- I- I- I

470
02:26:32,229 --> 02:26:37,860
can't- I don't know where to put it ever. I hate this box. I don't want- yeah, I don't want this

471
02:26:37,860 --> 02:27:04,520
fishing tackle box. I- I don't- it's annoying to use. Somehow we're getting more chickens.

472
02:27:05,239 --> 02:27:23,930
How do they keep increasing? They keep increasing. Man, I- this makes me anxiety. I hate this.

473
02:27:25,420 --> 02:27:31,420
I don't do- I can't do clothes thing. Big closet or something. No, no, no. I just have five Star

474
02:27:31,420 --> 02:27:39,860
War shirts, four pairs of jeans, a suit, and a bunch of fucking cartoon shirts. I can't do this.

475
02:27:40,500 --> 02:27:59,610
I have- I mean, well, let me look at it. This is- this is like a nice shirt. This is fine.

476
02:27:59,610 --> 02:28:13,899
It's a nice bean. I have got five of these, six of these. I got like seven or eight pairs of jeans.

477
02:28:14,620 --> 02:28:35,049
Different colors. Some slacks. You're speaking gibberish? What do you mean? What? Man, I gotta

478
02:28:35,049 --> 02:29:50,739
get some of these boxes out of the fucking way. Get up there. Huh? Why can I hang these? I was

479
02:29:50,739 --> 02:30:40,059
gonna put the pants on the bottom and the shirts on top. I don't care anymore. It's such a mess.

480
02:30:40,860 --> 02:30:44,250
It just- all their clothes are all over the place. They don't even color

481
02:30:44,250 --> 02:31:02,440
coordinate or anything. It's such a mess. I'm not a designer. I'm not a designer, all right?

482
02:31:03,159 --> 02:31:15,989
You're just lazy? I'm not- I'm not lazy. I don't know- I don't know where things are supposed to

483
02:31:15,989 --> 02:31:27,049
go in a big walk-in closet. I just- underwear goes in the underwear slot, shirts go in the shirt

484
02:31:27,129 --> 02:31:35,500
slot, pants go wherever you want. Anywhere. At the end of the day, as long as you just kind of know

485
02:31:35,500 --> 02:31:40,219
where your clothes are, does it really matter that much? As long as you know where your stuff is.

486
02:31:41,020 --> 02:32:06,379
And it's not a mess if it was clean in here. Of course there's a fucking book in here.

487
02:32:08,409 --> 02:32:15,020
Of course there's- of course there's a goddamn book in there. They have so many books that- that's

488
02:32:15,100 --> 02:32:25,829
in the bathroom boxes. It's in the clothes boxes. You have too many books. All right, where was I?

489
02:32:29,100 --> 02:33:17,430
Oh shit, that was bad. Was that cookie tin? I don't think- I think it's a sewing kit.

490
02:33:17,430 --> 02:33:31,620
I think this is a sewing kit. Yeah, this is definitely for sewing. Oh shit. Hiding something

491
02:33:31,620 --> 02:34:26,889
here. This all can't fit over there. All right, bathroom time. I thought that was a wishbone.

492
02:34:27,450 --> 02:34:41,659
One of those sinks. One of the sinks that has the- the laminor flow. This is definitely one

493
02:34:41,659 --> 02:34:58,250
of those sinks. I love it. How do you say it? Yeah, laminar. Laminar flow, yeah. I learned.

494
02:34:58,250 --> 02:35:16,840
I paid attention last time you talked. I heard what you said. I don't want this thing, but I'll

495
02:35:16,840 --> 02:37:19,020
put it over here. Oh, that's cute. Yeah, these are cool. Oh, look. Oh, look. Oh, look. Oh, look. Oh,

496
02:37:19,020 --> 02:37:42,489
look. More of the same- how many copies of this book do you need? How many copies of this book

497
02:37:42,489 --> 02:38:11,100
do you have? That's a lot. That's a lot of copies of the same book. It's a published book.

498
02:38:11,739 --> 02:39:39,590
Let's go. Let's go. There's so much shit on this desk. Hey. Hey, look. All right, living room time.

499
02:39:39,590 --> 02:39:43,110
Observation, humor, Andy. I feel like I haven't talked in like an hour.

500
02:40:06,940 --> 02:40:11,180
Wii motes always go on top in front of the TV. They never go inside of any storage. They're always

501
02:40:11,180 --> 02:40:14,620
in front of the TV, so you're ready to game. Anyone that comes in your house always knows

502
02:40:14,620 --> 02:40:22,950
you're ready for the Wii. The Wii motes on top of a certain visible area is a prop. It's a set for

503
02:40:22,950 --> 02:40:33,579
your house. It's a way to start a conversation. It's a way to get gaming immediately. These are

504
02:40:33,579 --> 02:41:38,090
not out of the way. They're there by very much by design. What is that? This goes in the kitchen,

505
02:41:38,090 --> 02:42:31,479
right? I need the- anything that holds that. Oh, my favorite part. I'm fixing it. I know people

506
02:42:31,479 --> 02:42:35,159
are freaking out right now. They're in the wrong spot. They're in the wrong spot. I got it under

507
02:42:35,159 --> 02:42:51,930
control. And next person that says wrong spot, Andy, would hate to be you. It's called the timeout.

508
02:43:19,260 --> 02:43:45,510
So many games. We have a shitload of games. Oh, my goodness. I don't have enough room for any of

509
02:43:45,510 --> 02:44:17,530
this stuff. Um, the cane. Where do I put the cane? Figure it out later. You look a little pale.

510
02:44:17,530 --> 02:44:29,110
Probably the white balance. I got a big bright ass light in my face. I can't see. I got to get

511
02:44:29,110 --> 02:44:48,180
these two boxes out of here. Glassware up here. Bulbware up here. Just- I need to get the boxes

512
02:44:48,180 --> 02:45:24,969
out of the way. Like, I can't see without moving it. Okay, now I can see. Let's get some stuff

513
02:45:24,969 --> 02:45:53,450
situated. Okay, shit. All right, move this out of the way. We'll put these here. These all go

514
02:45:53,450 --> 02:46:10,260
together. All right, I'm gonna put these up here. This gets the toy truck out of the way. Uh, this

515
02:46:10,260 --> 02:46:16,260
is like a serving tray, whatever. All right, I need to- spices and sweets need to go up here.

516
02:46:16,819 --> 02:46:41,559
Spices and sweets go up there. Coffee's gonna go up top. Freaking out. Why? Why? What do you- what

517
02:46:41,559 --> 02:46:58,170
do you mean? Why are you freaking out? Go- go- go to the- I'm- I'm fine. I don't have to go to the

518
02:46:58,170 --> 02:47:29,670
bathroom. I'm fine. What are you talking about? Ooh, that's helpful. You mean in the game. Oh,

519
02:47:29,670 --> 02:48:19,540
okay. Towel. Cheese grater. Poster. Trash bags. Idiot. This looks like- looks like a

520
02:48:19,540 --> 02:49:31,819
fucking kitty litter thing. I'm sorry. Freaking. Freaking. What are the utensils? Oven mitts.

521
02:49:34,840 --> 02:50:31,690
Another tray. Nice. Go piss. I don't need to pee. Stop. That can't fit up here. The rolling pin

522
02:50:31,690 --> 02:51:38,180
needs to be able to fit in here somewhere, right? Okay, there we go. Ah, utensils. Fuck. I can move

523
02:51:38,180 --> 02:51:46,219
with that. I can move with that so I can talk. Just slow down and say what you want to say.

524
02:51:46,219 --> 02:52:13,079
I can move all that stuff up here in a minute. Okay, let's do it. Salt. Uh, paprika. Keep the,

525
02:52:14,040 --> 02:53:15,260
where's our shower? Why is the microwave next to- you just hurt my chest. There's nowhere else

526
02:53:15,260 --> 02:54:38,870
for it to go. Books. What is this? Oh, just getting it out. Don't worry. It's gonna be fine.

527
02:54:38,870 --> 02:55:42,389
Why is there a toaster in here? Um, guys, where am I supposed to put this? Move. What is this

528
02:55:42,389 --> 02:56:02,280
even doing in here? I'm setting the table. You catch the game last night? What's your favorite

529
02:56:02,280 --> 02:56:12,579
subject in school? Do you like hot fudge sundaes? Somebody just said did I catch the game last night

530
02:56:12,579 --> 02:56:32,620
and it freaked me out. That looks nice. I don't want, I don't want to put this in here. Okay.

531
02:56:33,420 --> 02:56:40,819
What's, what remains? Oh, there's an upstairs. Oh shit. Okay, so we do have a bathroom up here.

532
02:56:41,770 --> 02:57:27,479
I forgot. Why did I not finish this? Tissues. Eh. Okay. Am I almost done with the game?

533
02:57:28,120 --> 02:58:03,270
When does the game end? Oh, this is the last level. Oh shit. All right. Laundry. Okay. Okay.

534
02:58:03,270 --> 02:58:39,159
Okay. What do we do with this towel? Whoa, there's a whole nother place to put stuff.

535
02:58:39,159 --> 02:59:46,379
Okay. Oops. Fuck. It's a bath mat. So what? Oh, right. What is this bag of dog food?

536
02:59:46,379 --> 03:00:02,790
What is this? I don't know what it is. Actually, I really don't know. This is soil. Why would there

537
03:00:02,790 --> 03:00:37,510
be a bag of soil in the laundry room? It's a bag of dirt. Okay. This has got to come with me.

538
03:00:40,309 --> 03:00:48,979
I just got to cut the other bathroom. It's got to come with me. Now what's the problem?

539
03:00:48,979 --> 03:01:15,860
Okay. It's very unhappy with this. Why? The coffee can be there. What's wrong with the coffee being

540
03:01:15,860 --> 03:01:48,229
up there? Bro, where else am I supposed to put this stuff? Bro, I think that's good. Apparently,

541
03:01:48,229 --> 03:02:10,329
the scanner can't go here. So the scanner is going to the office. Problem solved. Problem solved.

542
03:02:10,329 --> 03:02:33,100
I have to fix this, don't I? I can't believe I did that. I need to, I need some protein or something.

543
03:02:33,100 --> 03:02:36,459
I need to eat like a bag of peanuts. I don't know what the fuck I was doing.

544
03:02:37,510 --> 03:02:52,260
I actually don't know what the heck I was doing. Okay. There's all kinds of problems.

545
03:02:52,260 --> 03:03:12,250
Look at all these problems. Plant. All right. What am I missing here? This is in the wrong spot.

546
03:03:12,250 --> 03:03:24,860
Not anymore. Nope. Okay. That's in the wrong spot too. What am I going to do about this?

547
03:03:27,059 --> 03:03:58,629
This bag doesn't fit. Yes. Towel and that's it. Let's go. Just put an extra towel somewhere.

548
03:03:59,190 --> 03:04:09,450
Just a fresh towel somewhere. What do I do with this? I don't. What do I do with this towel?

549
03:04:09,450 --> 03:04:28,920
I can't go in the baby room. Where is this supposed to go? Thanks. I appreciate the help

550
03:04:28,920 --> 03:04:35,239
when you say up my butt. Thank you. Thanks. But like I'm looking for a practical answer.

551
03:04:35,239 --> 03:04:48,920
Where is this supposed to go? Under the sink? How am I supposed to put this under the sink?

552
03:04:54,219 --> 03:04:58,459
Oh, I don't know, dude. Maybe like up your butt. Try up your ass. Oh, okay.

553
03:05:01,510 --> 03:05:06,950
This is an extra towel. I don't need this. This is an extra towel.

554
03:05:07,670 --> 03:05:22,549
I don't need this extra towel. Dude, this can't go anywhere.

555
03:05:29,190 --> 03:06:35,959
Now where does this piece of shit go? I just go. This dude is cracked. Oh no, sorry. I'm going to

556
03:06:35,959 --> 03:06:57,500
go and they all do it for me. There's a lot. Take another bong rip. No, I'm good. I'm good.

557
03:06:57,500 --> 03:07:11,079
I think I'm good. I like this a lot. This is really fun. There's one thing I would change in

558
03:07:11,079 --> 03:07:19,659
this game and that's to be able to be allowed to have stuff in the wrong place. It's the only

559
03:07:19,659 --> 03:07:25,379
complaint I have. It's this very solid fun game though. I thought it was good. That was great.

560
03:07:26,340 --> 03:07:33,430
There's a setting where you could do that. Oh, cool. That was a good time.

561
03:07:41,110 --> 03:07:41,909
Let's get a song.

562
03:07:41,909 --> 03:07:48,760
Knock on the door. Now all your stuff is here in boxes on the floor.

563
03:07:49,559 --> 03:07:57,639
You open up. There is so much to do. I open up my heart. Did you understand the plot?

564
03:07:59,639 --> 03:08:03,659
I think a little. Yeah.

565
03:08:15,799 --> 03:08:17,000
Three games finished in one day.

566
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:21,719
You can't count Freddy fish. That doesn't work.

567
03:08:29,139 --> 03:08:40,219
I do look kind of pale, don't I? It's because of the lighting here.

568
03:08:42,219 --> 03:08:47,459
Auto balance. I kind of look a little blurry.

569
03:08:50,340 --> 03:09:00,729
I just moved it over to look at it. That was a lot of fun.

570
03:09:01,690 --> 03:09:06,010
That's a good place to end it. Six and a half hours about.

571
03:09:06,809 --> 03:09:12,889
Freddy fish was fun. This game was fun. Good hanging out with you.

572
03:09:24,870 --> 03:09:33,079
Yeah, have a good time. I had a great time. Yes, have a good time. Yes, I have a good time.

573
03:09:33,719 --> 03:09:45,100
I had a great time. Next time you're going to see me will be Wednesday.

574
03:09:46,870 --> 03:09:50,950
See you guys on Wednesday around the same time, between 2 and 2.30 ish.

575
03:09:51,829 --> 03:10:09,430
I say 2, I know, but it really means 2.20. Great, I'll see you Thursday or Friday. Nope,

576
03:10:09,430 --> 03:10:17,180
it's going to be Wednesday. I got a lot of stuff to do this weekend.

577
03:10:19,100 --> 03:10:23,979
There are many, many things that my brain is going to be spread out into five or six places.

578
03:10:24,940 --> 03:10:28,540
So I'm going to have to take the time this weekend to situate them all.

579
03:10:29,260 --> 03:10:37,370
Yeah, see you Wednesday, two o'clock. I don't know. I have no idea what we're going to play.

580
03:10:40,170 --> 03:10:51,399
It'll be something cool, though. I hope. All right, guys, let's run the credits going.

581
03:10:52,120 --> 03:11:08,819
This music is going to stay on. That's fine. What is the oh, never mind.

582
03:11:09,540 --> 03:11:16,420
I enjoyed the music. They would know the game is great. That's really chill.

583
03:11:19,899 --> 03:11:27,319
It was a good chill time. What should I do on Wednesday, though? That's a real good question.

584
03:11:36,200 --> 03:11:45,379
Cruelty Squad? I don't know. I feel like playing Ultra Kill drained me of two straight weeks of

585
03:11:45,379 --> 03:11:55,930
video game playing. I can do Dread X. Don't you feel like you want to have Dread X be for a weekend,

586
03:11:55,930 --> 03:12:01,930
though? And which one should I play? Because there's four or five different compilations.

587
03:12:01,930 --> 03:12:19,479
Which one's a good one? Just start at the beginning. Vampire Survivor. We'll figure it out.

588
03:12:20,280 --> 03:12:29,850
They're all good. Each could be its own stream. Really? OK, I'll look into that. Maybe we'll do

589
03:12:29,850 --> 03:12:36,020
that on Wednesday. Maybe we'll play the first one. Unless we can get some ideas. I can go look at

590
03:12:36,020 --> 03:12:47,639
the recommended two. All right, guys. Good night. Goodbye. Take care of yourselves. Thanks for

591
03:12:47,639 --> 03:14:00,569
watching. Call your mother. Have a great night. We'll see you again soon. Take care.
