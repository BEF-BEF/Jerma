00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:13,089
Hi. Hello everyone, German985 here. Just kidding. Hello everyone, German985 here.

2
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:21,440
Oh well, you can't lie to them like that. What's up guys? Did anyone believe it?

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,160
No one's even here to hear it, so. Yeah, there is like

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,300
15-20 people already here. Oh, you're on Twitch. My bad.

5
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,890
I am on the Twitch-itch. Anyways, happy Saturday.

6
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,509
Happy Sunday if you are from a different country. And let me

7
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:47,310
shout this out to people. Actually, I gotta write

8
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:55,549
at MLC Stealth. Oh, come on.

9
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:59,409
Hold on, what? How come I can't bring up Brett

10
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:03,649
as like an at mention? Maybe he like blew up his Twitter.

11
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:09,370
MLC Stealth. Wait, can I not even do you either?

12
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:14,769
What is going on here, Twitter? Twitter, what is going on?

13
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:23,730
Why are you being like this? I'm gonna tweet too. You could retweet what I tweet.

14
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:28,689
We can all tweet. You can pick your nose. You tweet, I tweet.

15
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:35,370
But you can't pick your friends' nose. We all tweet for JermaStream.

16
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:46,620
With at MLC. Okay, that was weird. I don't know why it didn't work before.

17
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:55,019
I wonder who that is. And tweet.

18
00:01:55,019 --> 00:02:00,609
No, no tweet. Don't tweet yet. I already tweeted.

19
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:05,049
Oh, no. Oh, no, no. I was talking to myself, not to you.

20
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:08,250
I was telling myself, because I was gonna hit the Twitter button,

21
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:16,240
and I didn't even put the link, so I was like, no, no. It has been twittered.

22
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,199
And yes, it has. There's Twitter.

23
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:28,889
Now I'll go to YouTube and post that.

24
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:34,960
And then get out of there, because it's not necessary.

25
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:45,909
And Saturday Stream. Okay, good evening.

26
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:49,830
We're gonna play some Team Fortress 2, and then, if you guys don't know,

27
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,530
they just put out a huge, huge CSGO update.

28
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,919
So that should be interesting to check out, for sure.

29
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:04,289
It's like one of the biggest, they've added like, they had like five maps.

30
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:09,460
I would love to express my enthusiasm for that, but alas, I cannot.

31
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:14,860
You don't have it. I don't have it, no.

32
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:22,800
Oh, wow. Yeah, I think they're gonna, it's, release is coming soon.

33
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:32,460
I think it's coming soon. Otherwise, the update today was pretty huge, so.

34
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,860
You know Valve, though. It's gonna be months, probably.

35
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,539
Yeah, yeah, true. Very true.

36
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:43,650
Good evening, everyone. All of you that are saying good evening.

37
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:48,219
I bid you good morrow and good tidings.

38
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:49,819
So let's get rolling.

39
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:55,789
MLC Stealth is here, but he's currently, he's currently in the bathroom.

40
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:58,780
And that's all we're gonna say about that.

41
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:05,580
So let's, we're gonna find a server that is empty.

42
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,879
Do we need to wait for him before we join a server so that he can play?

43
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,159
Ah, yeah. He's gonna have to deal with it.

44
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,620
Oh, there you go. There he is.

45
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,810
Perfect timing, sir. Thank you.

46
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:22,589
I was waiting for the right moment to enter, and that one seemed pretty good.

47
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,639
No, I was watching clips from the Ellen DeGeneres show.

48
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,240
Why, why are you doing that?

49
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,779
She's funny. Sorry, I'm late.

50
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:34,610
You're supposed to be in the stream.

51
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:39,259
Now let's get into this server. Let's try and find a 32. Here we go.

52
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:45,959
CP Badlands. Eh, I don't know if I wanna do CP Badlands.

53
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:50,110
This is 28. That's 2-4. That's trading.

54
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,310
Oh, here we go. That's 2 out of 24.

55
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,610
Alright, you guys ready?

56
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,769
Uh, not quite yet.

57
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:56,610
Oh, you better hurry up.

58
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,689
I'm, I'm launching it.

59
00:04:57,689 --> 00:04:59,290
It's already on that screen. It's already on.

60
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:02,170
I'm already, I've already got Xbox connected, my console.

61
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,569
Ready to go.

62
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,689
Wait, couple seconds.

63
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:09,089
Oh, by the way, if you guys may, everyone knows who Stealth is,

64
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:11,170
but some people may not know who you are, Italics.

65
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,439
Go ahead and give an introduction.

66
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,600
Hey guys, my name is Italics, and I make YouTube videos.

67
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,439
And my channel name is Gamers Descent,

68
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:22,800
which you may know me by instead of Italics.

69
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,689
That is where I hail from.

70
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:29,600
Yeah, you come from the mountain top of Gamers Descent.

71
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,240
What time is it right now? It is 15 after six.

72
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,019
People were just saying that.

73
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:35,980
Alright, I'm ready.

74
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,329
What are we going to say, Italics, before I cut you off?

75
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:41,860
I don't, I don't know.

76
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,300
I guess to further introduce myself,

77
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,660
I'm a machinima realm director.

78
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,779
So I'm on, I'm on the other side of the chasm

79
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,100
between the two machinima mountains.

80
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:52,509
I come in peace.

81
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:53,990
Here we go. People are already starting to join.

82
00:05:53,990 --> 00:06:04,819
Let's do it. 68.177.101.44 colon 27016.

83
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:06,680
You better go.

84
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,439
Oh, that confused me. It had 16.

85
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:14,000
I pressed six first.

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,480
Well, you better get in there.

87
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,660
Those team numbers always confuse me.

88
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,660
Hey, I think, so it still says, oh, I'm playing,

89
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,579
I didn't even update the dashboard either.

90
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:24,899
And I think it's still correct.

91
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:26,939
Actually, I'll have to change it right now.

92
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:31,009
Oh. Put TF2 MOAB hunting.

93
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:36,420
TF2 MOAB hunting.

94
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,060
All you're going to do is get 25 kills in a row.

95
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,509
That's very difficult to do in this game.

96
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:43,269
That is not an easy thing to do in Team Fortress,

97
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,389
to get more than, more than,

98
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,069
I'd say more than 15 kills in a row,

99
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:50,160
10 kills in a row is even like a pretty big feat of strength.

100
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,689
The only one who could do it is a, like, an engineer.

101
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:56,689
Yeah, a heavy too. Heavy can get a lot of kills.

102
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:58,930
An engineer if nobody is, like, smart and going

103
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:04,470
demo mannered over medic.

104
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:08,569
I went on to see a red team.

105
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:11,689
How's the game audio? Let's take a look.

106
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:14,089
Yeah, it's all right.

107
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:15,529
How's the end game audio, guys?

108
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:20,060
Good. I cannot tell.

109
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,620
Are you going to tell them what your name is?

110
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,220
Uh, people will probably figure it out by now.

111
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:32,410
Dick Simmons, the dump champion.

112
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,769
Oh, where's the scout going?

113
00:07:34,769 --> 00:07:36,490
Oh!

114
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,379
That's a pretty nice flare gun, dude.

115
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:43,470
Oh, I thought that was you.

116
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,829
Oh, watch it. Watch out.

117
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:50,759
What's up, Stil?

118
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,060
I forgot fire kills me.

119
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,300
Going up pretty well here.

120
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,660
All right, what do I have for a melee right now?

121
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,839
I don't even know.

122
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,160
Oh, actually, I got the postal pummeler.

123
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,060
All right, let's try and get some postal pummeler kills.

124
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,220
Yeah, you, no, you're not a spy.

125
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,209
I need a medic.

126
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,050
Oh, yeah.

127
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:11,649
We did it.

128
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:14,430
Game over.

129
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,740
Oh, we did it, guys.

130
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,740
So we can do it again.

131
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:24,180
Pretty cool.

132
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,449
Oh, we're changing.

133
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:26,569
I wanted to play on Upward, too.

134
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:27,689
Oh, I love Upward.

135
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:29,980
I know, I love it, too.

136
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,889
Upward is one of my favorites.

137
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:37,450
Upward.

138
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,269
Oh.

139
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,070
What are we going to do now?

140
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,429
My most kills is only 25 as a sniper.

141
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:44,399
I would have only gotten one MOAB.

142
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,120
I have no idea.

143
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,240
Oh, Thunder Mountain. Good. I love Thunder Mountain.

144
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,720
I like the first two stages.

145
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,080
Thunder Mountain.

146
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,000
Jerma, can I be has in a hug?

147
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,360
If you're asking for a hug, here, ready?

148
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,360
Internet hug.

149
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:56,879
There we go.

150
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:59,940
He has him in your hug.

151
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,379
Here we go.

152
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:02,080
He has been in.

153
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,389
Here comes the internet hug.

154
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:08,539
You just received internet hug.

155
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:10,429
Worth $15.

156
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:12,600
You've got hugs.

157
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,009
That's actually pretty good.

158
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:16,169
You've got mail.

159
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:17,289
Oh, I have a new item.

160
00:09:17,289 --> 00:09:18,409
Oh, I got a new item.

161
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:19,490
I'm giving away my backpack.

162
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:24,559
I finally got some new stuff.

163
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,759
Why am I even running?

164
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,679
Waiting for players.

165
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,820
Where are we going?

166
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,620
You guys, no one's got to give me stuff.

167
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,409
I mean, items are one thing.

168
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:35,129
I have a nice plan.

169
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:37,659
As you probably saw in my latest video, if you haven't,

170
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:40,820
I'm going to do a crate unboxing video.

171
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,789
And whatever I get in those crates,

172
00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:45,509
if I get an unusual or something,

173
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:47,919
it's going to be given away.

174
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:50,799
Any unusual I get in the boxes is going to be given away.

175
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,440
And if I get strangers, they're mine.

176
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,440
I'm keeping them.

177
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,029
Oh, we got a false server.

178
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:01,789
I will probably...

179
00:10:01,789 --> 00:10:03,710
Is this 24?

180
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,100
Yeah, this is five spectators.

181
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,330
I'm sure some people are kind of stuck in spectator right now.

182
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:14,480
But the unboxing video will probably be next week,

183
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,070
I would assume.

184
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,179
A duel, you say?

185
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:20,860
Dick Simmons, the Dump Champion.

186
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,419
Yeah, that's me.

187
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:23,299
Dick Simmons, the Dump Champion.

188
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:27,029
Wait, did you put end quotes on that?

189
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:29,629
I think this is just a parentheses.

190
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,080
That's all I know.

191
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,679
Is Shibby on this stream?

192
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:37,200
I don't think so.

193
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,190
I've been wrong before, though.

194
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,389
All right, I closed my door there.

195
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:44,470
Shibby is not on this stream.

196
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,629
Not in the chat, anyway.

197
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:48,340
No, not that I can see.

198
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,340
High five.

199
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,220
Thank you.

200
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,039
Can I just kill somebody already?

201
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:55,559
We got to wait.

202
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,039
It's setup time, man.

203
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:00,899
I want to blow them underneath the fence.

204
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,379
Will I ever play Dawn of War 2?

205
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:03,220
Oh, man.

206
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,659
I was a huge Dawn of War 1 fan.

207
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:06,820
I don't really like what they did with Dawn of War 2.

208
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,820
I'm not going to lie.

209
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,419
I wasn't a big Dawn of War 2 person.

210
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:13,210
Oh, my God.

211
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:17,490
Oh, I forgot, I don't have a shotgun.

212
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:17,970
Still pretty good.

213
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,080
Oh, thanks.

214
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,740
Covered in the G.F. Rowdy.

215
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,179
I'm going to puke because I get...

216
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:27,039
Gerardi makes me puke.

217
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:29,980
Oh, my God, Gerardi, get out of here.

218
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,269
Conqueror.

219
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:33,419
Conturer.

220
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:35,379
I can't believe how many no points I got right there.

221
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:37,879
Oh, no, damn it.

222
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,559
I thought I had more rockets loaded.

223
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,960
S-H-I-T.

224
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,759
What does that spell?

225
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,809
Shoot.

226
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:45,620
Gosh darn it.

227
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,379
Oh, Goose Jr.

228
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:50,330
That's what that spells.

229
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,129
Ba-boom, ba-boom.

230
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:53,090
Who am I streaming with?

231
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,649
MLC Stealth and Italics.

232
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:59,179
Two bros.

233
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:01,379
We play games.

234
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:03,100
Therefore, we are special.

235
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,220
Sometimes we play video games.

236
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,230
Occasionally.

237
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,789
Sometimes we laugh.

238
00:12:08,789 --> 00:12:10,070
Sometimes we cry.

239
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,350
Sometimes we share valuable moments together

240
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,230
that make us better.

241
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,230
Oh, he's going to get away.

242
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,309
I refuse to let him get away.

243
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:20,250
He's going to get behind everybody.

244
00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:21,730
He's going to get behind us all.

245
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:22,649
I think he already is.

246
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:24,899
Oh, he's gone.

247
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:29,059
Oh, nine health, and I'm jumping off of high surfaces.

248
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:30,980
Oh, how do I survive?

249
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,899
Give me that health.

250
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:37,940
Can you donate an unusual?

251
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,759
I thought you were about to say, can you dig it, sucker?

252
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,080
I would rather you hang on to that.

253
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,840
I don't need anything.

254
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,600
You don't have to give me stuff.

255
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,159
Booker T.

256
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:48,679
Especially an unusual, because an unusual is worth a lot.

257
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:56,620
And I don't want to take stuff like that from people, so.

258
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,820
Oh, did I make it?

259
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,169
Oh, my God.

260
00:13:00,169 --> 00:13:01,919
That was a good shot.

261
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:10,220
That guy caught me right when I was coming down.

262
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,580
Boom.

263
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,100
I got to take off the Conqueror.

264
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:21,360
Conqueror is a cool, not feeling the Conqueror.

265
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,750
Not right now.

266
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:27,259
Oh, damn.

267
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:36,659
That was in the face.

268
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:37,740
I'm taking this off.

269
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,899
I'm going to put on, what am I going to put on?

270
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:43,340
I'm going to put on the shotgun.

271
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,389
The strange shotgun, I still have to give these away.

272
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:47,789
I have given my third.

273
00:13:47,789 --> 00:13:50,690
I've given 33% of the backpack away so far.

274
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,049
Two more people I have to get in contact with.

275
00:13:53,049 --> 00:14:01,740
And then after that, start all over again.

276
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,259
All right, I'm going medic.

277
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:08,740
Yeah, we could use, we only got one.

278
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,940
Oh, actually, you are the one.

279
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,019
You just switched.

280
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:12,659
Actually, there's two, I think.

281
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:13,899
Ari's medicing.

282
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:18,860
Oh, OK, OK, OK, sexy, sexy.

283
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,700
Which one is Jerma?

284
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:27,360
I swear, it's not Dick Simmons, the Dumped Champion.

285
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,100
That is a spy.

286
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,169
Oh, no.

287
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:39,590
OK, if I see Uba, is it Uba Charge?

288
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,470
What classes are you guys playing as right now?

289
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,110
I'm soldier.

290
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,120
Oh, no.

291
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,889
Oh, so little help.

292
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:50,059
I am the sniper jam.

293
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:51,379
What are my video settings on here?

294
00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:52,889
I'll show you.

295
00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:56,570
Video, 1280 by 720, because I'm running in a window right now.

296
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,379
It's going to be able to stream it.

297
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:02,460
But I play on high, high, high, simple, medium, disabled color

298
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,779
correction, and then all these other things.

299
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,100
I don't play with anti-aliasing on.

300
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,460
I feel like the amount of resources

301
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,740
it takes to the amount of gain you get

302
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,860
is not really that noticeable, at least in my opinion.

303
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,120
At least for a game like this.

304
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,480
Oh, my word.

305
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,279
Thank you for putting me out of fire, Pyro.

306
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,600
I always play with Vsync.

307
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,279
God damn.

308
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,940
Always.

309
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:36,419
I'm changing to engineer.

310
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:38,789
Do I play any commonly hated games?

311
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:40,990
Oh, backstab, turn around, spy.

312
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,950
Do you guys play any commonly hated games?

313
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,740
He's outside our door.

314
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,659
Any commonly hated games?

315
00:15:47,659 --> 00:15:48,419
I call a duty.

316
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:50,700
What would fall under that?

317
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,259
That's probably number one right there.

318
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:53,299
Yeah, stealth.

319
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:54,539
Answer is yes.

320
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:58,120
Stealth does play commonly hated games.

321
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:04,460
But actually hated, literally bad games, I don't know.

322
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:11,309
Yeah, I don't think I play any really hated games.

323
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:13,389
Oh, there's the sniper again.

324
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,129
We still got a level one up.

325
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:17,570
Oh, I think I'm about to score.

326
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,210
Oh, come on.

327
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,529
Is this guy hacking?

328
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:25,289
I see a spy on their team running around in his taunts,

329
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:29,129
and he looks like a wax figure just moving around,

330
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:30,830
skating around.

331
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:34,009
It's probably a glitch or something, I don't know.

332
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:35,090
Yeah, I saw that earlier too.

333
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,139
I think it is just a glitch.

334
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:38,539
But even when he was disguised,

335
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,980
it was just walking around, like not moving.

336
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:46,590
Like arms in the air.

337
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,309
Oh, I gotta change this.

338
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:52,139
I don't gotta change that, what am I doing?

339
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:52,980
You gotta change it.

340
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,330
Oh, I gotta hurry the hell up.

341
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,580
Oh boy.

342
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,250
I was a second behind.

343
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,870
I threw my games off, rollin' off now.

344
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,339
What is this, like an RTS?

345
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:06,720
I've gotta catch up.

346
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,539
My actions permitted is only 100.

347
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:16,500
Let's go, let's go.

348
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,579
Let's do a hoot.

349
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,500
What's the best scatter gun for the scout?

350
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,819
They're all good.

351
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,690
It depends on how you play stylus.

352
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:27,480
Mid-range to long-range, you use the shortstop.

353
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,599
Close range, meat shots, force of nature,

354
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,000
and everything else kind of in between.

355
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,400
The regular scatter gun's probably the best,

356
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,000
at least that's kinda how I see it.

357
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,569
I like that one the best.

358
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:38,089
No, I gotta go over here, what am I doing?

359
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:40,420
Oh god, I've already screwed this up.

360
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,519
Can I salvage this is the real question.

361
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:48,269
That's the real question, can I salvage this?

362
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:49,309
What am I doing?

363
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:50,509
I don't know where I wanna put it.

364
00:17:50,509 --> 00:17:51,789
I don't know what I wanna do.

365
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:54,089
I'm so torn right now.

366
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:55,049
Because this guy's right here now,

367
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:57,339
I'm puttin' it right here.

368
00:17:57,339 --> 00:17:58,579
Dilemmas, dilemmas.

369
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:00,619
That was so torn, my brain couldn't

370
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:05,500
not handle what I was just doing.

371
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:11,339
Oh lord, oh this is going down in two seconds.

372
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:12,180
I am absolutely.

373
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,099
Oh lag.

374
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:14,690
Oh yeah, I got that too.

375
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:20,740
Super lag, is that the real MLC stealth?

376
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,579
I hope so.

377
00:18:21,579 --> 00:18:22,920
Yep.

378
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,099
Oh, I'm gettin' a lot of lag.

379
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:27,980
Thank you, Engineer, for helping me build this.

380
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:33,420
Appreciate it.

381
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,029
Let's reload.

382
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:36,470
Is that the real MLC stealth?

383
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:41,599
Oh yeah.

384
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:43,839
All right, I got some catching up to do in points.

385
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,519
This is kinda getting embarrassing.

386
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:46,359
Oh my gosh.

387
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,680
Here comes, oh there goes the dispenser.

388
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,079
Oh my god, oh he's up top.

389
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:54,549
Oh, that just ruined my life.

390
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:55,710
There's the spy again.

391
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,470
Unmoving.

392
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,630
Yeah, I got him.

393
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,029
Or maybe he did run too nice.

394
00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:08,170
We're goin' this.

395
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,380
I like this better.

396
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,900
So I don't feel as bad when I lose all my stuff.

397
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:17,460
I was spy, doin' his thing.

398
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,920
I think that, oh my word.

399
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,730
He is doin' his thing, isn't he?

400
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,410
Get away, roommate.

401
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,609
He's still alive.

402
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:27,690
Oh, he is not dead.

Find him!

410
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:42,740
He's on the cart.

411
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,619
Oh my god.

412
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:48,230

I wanted up here.

415
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:55,900
They're about to get to the point.

416
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,740
They're almost there.

417
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,579
Oh, crit thing.

Oh no.

424

Oh, I can't believe I'm still alive.

425
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,579
Additional time.

426
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:18,859
They got it.

427
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:19,779
No, I was dead.

428
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:23,220
I was toast right there.

429
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,579

432
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,190
the jeffrey's for anybody else that the chat brosford that somebody is coming

433
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,140
to you

434
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:43,900
uh... i don't think the chepros no i was looking at it and i was like wait no

435
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,700
uh...

436
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,579
all they're going to

437
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,299
they got a heavy medic right here

438
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:49,670
get rid of that medic

439
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,420
but what they could

440
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,420
uh...

441
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,779
but all else fails just

442
00:20:55,779 --> 00:20:57,059
ducking cover

443
00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:00,400
well i'll just rather than are you like sounds that stuff

444
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,039
than a prominent things

445
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,319
uh... you can find out i think

446
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:07,059
so there's a lot of

447
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:08,259
fishery of sp

448
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:10,180
their spies like surfing around in the

449
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,440
our base there's two spies i think sitting outside our doors

450
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,160
all dot he's over here

451
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,230
not wait but that's not in my

452
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,170
that's not my century

453
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,809

no no no

457
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,869

458
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:36,269
so many people

459
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:37,250

462
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,910
because

463
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,250
while i don't know

464
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,569

and that's right i can turn it

492
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:06,029
that you destroyed it

493
00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:09,930
because of the little

494
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,049
uh... i probably will play zombie fortress at some point

495
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:14,990
probably not a little what

496
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,730
zombie fortress

497
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,009

one

506
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:43,839
well that answers that question

507
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,339

00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,009
somebody's planet

yes it's it's like

519
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:10,990
it's kinda like a zombie boat where everyone runs around the lake separate

520
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:12,670
small group of people that don't have

521
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:15,619

00:24:21,609 --> 00:24:25,819
that's probably right and they said it's like halo infection much of spies

centuries

527
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,069
and that's going to blow up and kill me

528
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,230
and that's going to die as far as

529
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:33,950

530
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:36,109

00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:29,059
our battle is

548
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:31,059
about what about the words

549
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:33,200
yeah there's two spots on the point

550
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,349
on the card we lost

551
00:25:35,349 --> 00:25:38,019
but what do you guys know that i was

552
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:45,460
how many spots are on that day of team

553
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,140
uh... new uh... new server

554
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,579
not gg

555
00:25:48,579 --> 00:25:51,839
no no no s e v

556
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:52,980
are pv

557
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,740
party

558
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:02,000
go to

559
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,920
uh... national you know i'm gonna

560
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,240
screens go black for one second

561
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,089
because i'm gonna change uh...

562
00:26:09,089 --> 00:26:12,960
and change some real quick

563
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,720
why do that

564
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,599
i'll be ready for about ten seconds and you'll see what my parents

565
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:19,319
well because for some reason when i was

566
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:23,829
doing excellent in the game mode it was like in my game a lot of life

567
00:26:23,829 --> 00:26:26,210
sometimes i guess it does that

568
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:31,279
yeah are you using uh... it's like uh...

569
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,319
screen area

570
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:35,079
or the other one i was in the game source from the game that was like

571
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:36,420
lagging my games or

572
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,940
uh... try screen area

573
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:42,150
i'd add is that it's a nice change over

574
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:45,720
explicitly supposed to be like the release

575
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,059
uh... let's go to

576
00:26:48,099 --> 00:26:49,700
because of the simple

577
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:54,589
because of all of our high tower i've heard zero out of

578
00:26:54,589 --> 00:26:57,339
hopefully stuff gets back soon

579
00:26:57,339 --> 00:27:00,390
allies is going to be a good trouble

580
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,589
to delay for him

581
00:27:01,589 --> 00:27:03,549
when we were doing the test

582
00:27:03,549 --> 00:27:06,710
i was using game source and it was working fine so it just seems like

583
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:10,589
on again off again

584
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:13,430

i thought you didn't join that's what i thought at first

973
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:16,239
this is like a jellyfish server

974
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:20,940
like the screen is more like a jellyfish for me right now

975
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,699
we don't like everybody is

976
00:45:22,699 --> 00:45:25,599
look at this i feel like it's like

977
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,110
oh my god is claymation server

978
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:31,789
what's his name let me see what

979
00:45:31,789 --> 00:45:33,510
well uh...

980
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:36,960
all look at that hangs mind goodness gracious

981
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,960
everyone except for me and you is like

982
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,199
a hundred plus

983
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:43,179
it really looks like a click stop motion animation

984
00:45:43,179 --> 00:45:45,079
like that

985
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:48,440
all you know i'd like to put

986
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,519
so it feels like i'm playing at twenty frames per second but i'm not

987
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:53,789
but i'm not

988
00:45:53,789 --> 00:45:56,039
uh... sorry guys

989
00:45:56,039 --> 00:45:59,480
look at we got a change again because this is this bad

990
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,840
this is not this is not against the people who are here this is one of the

991
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,000
people who didn't get it

992
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,059
you know it's right if you don't even look at the street and see what what i

993
00:46:08,059 --> 00:46:11,440
see right now it is like

994
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,420
pretty much like a watch in a cartoon on drugs

995
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:18,840
uh...

996
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:22,030
all right well how do you have looks like nobody could even get into this one

997
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:22,909
there's only

998
00:46:22,909 --> 00:46:25,449
seven on eight

999
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,929
i apologize

1000
00:46:26,929 --> 00:46:28,230
i sorry

1001
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:31,210
news service

1002
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:32,769
take three

1003
00:46:32,769 --> 00:46:34,210
uh... third time's a charm

1004
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:35,650
but i want

1005
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:37,800
uh... to

1006
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,219
uh... three crunch

1007
00:46:39,219 --> 00:46:40,659
so it's like it might might

1008
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,780
it's not really a thirty two person server

1009
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,150
hope i can

1010
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:47,860
but it would tell i get that server will be okay

1011
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:50,599
i want to serve all the cool kids have one

1012
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,809
all right here we go

1013
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:55,530
sixty-six dot fifty-five

1014
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:57,659
dot one five four

1015
00:46:57,659 --> 00:46:59,199
don't two three four

1016
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:01,420
colon two seven zero one

1017
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,500
by

1018
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:06,019
and we paste this in a second once we get in

1019
00:47:06,019 --> 00:47:09,739
i do apologize that we have to do this twice now is the third time

1020
00:47:09,739 --> 00:47:11,760
hopefully this one is going to be the

1021
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:15,599
they pasted it in already

1022
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,960
told you it it was like literally two seconds after you said i thought pop up

1023
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,289
in the chat

1024
00:47:20,289 --> 00:47:22,449
as fast

1025
00:47:22,449 --> 00:47:23,409
well

1026
00:47:23,409 --> 00:47:25,809
lightning fast even you might say

1027
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:29,460
you can say that

1028
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:34,440
uh...

1029
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,280
well

1030
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,199
i'm going

1031
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:40,889
demo night

1032
00:47:40,889 --> 00:47:42,929
give them actually found

1033
00:47:42,929 --> 00:47:43,949
uh... sorry what

1034
00:47:43,949 --> 00:47:45,590
as a demo mom i was just

1035
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:47,480
uh... relaying what you just said

1036
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:52,179
i actually found a sultan ceremonial the other day

1037
00:47:52,179 --> 00:47:54,989
i was very happy about that

1038
00:47:54,989 --> 00:47:58,030
so now i can have a legit demo night if i wanted to give up my grenade launcher

1039
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:00,170
but

1040
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:01,250
so tough call

1041
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:05,309
for the for the booties

1042
00:48:05,309 --> 00:48:08,059
and we got steady

1043
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:16,650
wicked sick at

1044
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:18,840
so i have to do this right now

1045
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,969
because somebody keeps sending me

1046
00:48:21,969 --> 00:48:23,690
very inappropriate

1047
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:26,170
message and hopefully that stops that from happening

1048
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:32,519
i don't think it will but i at least right

1049
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:36,300
oh

1050
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,619
we've got a full server now

1051
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:39,780
good to go back out

1052
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:43,579
just in time it's off the railway

1053
00:48:43,579 --> 00:48:44,460
everyone

1054
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,659
also over at the same time

1055
00:48:46,659 --> 00:48:47,940
all my god you just

1056
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:51,480
totally pretty aggressive

1057
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,559
shot guns soldier

1058
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:58,900
shot guns soldier

1059
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,619
alike

1060
00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:01,579
did you see that

1061
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:02,800
yeah

1062
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,199
but i'd love to tonight

1063
00:49:06,199 --> 00:49:09,619
yeah i've only so far given one third of still waiting on two people so

1064
00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:11,599
eventually i will be giving

1065
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,659
a hundred percent but i have to wait for the other two people to get back to me

1066
00:49:16,659 --> 00:49:20,590
that hurt

1067
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:23,440
old yet i did quite a bit

1068
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,400
someone on the other team is announcing how many spice they have therefore

1069
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,860
apparently

1070
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:31,480
what a good trader he is

1071
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,559
uh... how ironic is that

1072
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:37,719
so he's a double spot yes if he is it he's telling us about spying so he's

1073
00:49:37,719 --> 00:49:38,840
spying

1074
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,360
on the spot

1075
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,300
for his own spots

1076
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,500
as someone in the comments will undoubtedly say

1077
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,599
spy section

1078
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:50,789
absolutely

1079
00:49:50,789 --> 00:49:53,269
problem is maybe he might be

1080
00:49:53,269 --> 00:49:56,690
more suspicious

1081
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:58,789
maybe he's a triple spy

1082
00:49:58,789 --> 00:50:01,159
he said i served no one

1083
00:50:01,159 --> 00:50:02,440
he did

1084
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,159
don't trust anyone

1085
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,800
like i like your attitude

1086
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,920
that's spying star

1087
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,880
ticket ugly he's got a chance to step in i already know this

1088
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,400
arin alice

1089
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:17,719
but a lot of times

1090
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:19,960
you are not a standard

1091
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,219
you have to go that way

1092
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:26,199
or cut the political

1093
00:50:26,199 --> 00:50:31,949
uh...

1094
00:50:31,949 --> 00:50:39,960
the

1095
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:44,780

there we go

1373
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:30,070
retrieving data

1374
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:32,059
yeah i'm probably only going to play

1375
01:04:32,059 --> 01:04:33,739
maybe two or three rounds maybe

1376
01:04:33,739 --> 01:04:39,099
ten twenty minutes or so i just want to check out the new update to be honest

1377
01:04:39,099 --> 01:04:42,670
okay so this is the new map no maybe not this is not one of the new maps is it

1378
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:46,239
i think i've already seen i've already seen no maybe not

1379
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:47,719
maybe it is a different map

1380
01:04:47,719 --> 01:04:55,880
we'll find out won't we

1381
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:59,760
trying to pick up a headshot damn

1382
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,380
so this is one of the new maps safe house

1383
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:12,460
there already is another one like this isn't there

1384
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:17,849

i'm gonna go around this way

1394
01:05:46,969 --> 01:05:47,889
see if i can't

1395
01:05:47,889 --> 01:05:54,900
pull something off here and i don't want to climb up there that's a bad idea

1396
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:57,150

1397
01:05:57,150 --> 01:05:59,659

i don't play league of legends

1428
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:57,500
too much for my brain to handle

1429
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:01,059
i feel the same way about week as i do about starcraft

1430
01:08:01,059 --> 01:08:01,980

1431
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:03,099

1433
01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:12,239

1434
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:15,739
is everyone's is really really good

1435
01:08:15,739 --> 01:08:20,390

01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:33,609
it's so interesting

1456
01:09:33,609 --> 01:09:36,300
you're like a row i love the girls man

1457
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:37,380
favorite bands

1458
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:41,550
by far

1459
01:09:41,550 --> 01:09:44,500
from behind off

1460
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:48,500
it's right here

1461
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:56,869
finally moving on moving on the world

1462
01:09:56,869 --> 01:09:59,819
all this to any of them

1463
01:09:59,819 --> 01:10:01,300
boom boom

1464
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:13,000
boom boom

1465
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,399
that keep in mind i'm playing this in a window

1466
01:10:15,399 --> 01:10:17,859
like half the size of my computer screen

1467
01:10:17,859 --> 01:10:23,180
so it can be kind of difficult to play this game

1468
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:30,199
how many bolts does it take

1469
01:10:30,199 --> 01:10:32,819
no i don't want to do that

1470
01:10:32,859 --> 01:10:39,810
al

1471
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:44,260
right

1472
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:49,779
uh...

1473
01:10:49,779 --> 01:10:52,340
yeah i i wish my computer was good enough to

1474
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:55,010
play games in full screen and stream them

1475
01:10:55,010 --> 01:10:58,380
but it is uh... it is almost impossible to do that

1476
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:01,369
and i'm i'm getting destroyed

1477
01:11:01,369 --> 01:11:02,779
my god

1478
01:11:02,779 --> 01:11:21,329
the whole team is like eighteen fourteen and this way i'm going this way

1479
01:11:21,329 --> 01:11:36,630
town

1480
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:39,979
you know that has shot god damn

1481
01:11:39,979 --> 01:11:42,359
yes not the it's not my internet it's uh...

1482
01:11:42,359 --> 01:11:43,439
my computer just

1483
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:44,800
probably would not be able to handle it

1484
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,550
and i guess internet to

1485
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:48,670
to stream at like ten eighty

1486
01:11:48,670 --> 01:12:02,930
or seven twenty it takes a lot of them so

1487
01:12:02,930 --> 01:12:05,100
now i was i don't

1488
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:08,819
that this this potentially is the worst i'd like the worst game i've ever had in

1489
01:12:08,819 --> 01:12:11,109
this entire game ever

1490
01:12:11,109 --> 01:12:11,989
like ever

1491
01:12:11,989 --> 01:12:14,159
uh...

1492
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:15,520
is making me look

1493
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,960
embarrassed now i don't care

1494
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:21,989

1495
01:12:21,989 --> 01:12:24,770

1496
01:12:24,770 --> 01:12:26,239

1497
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:28,720

1498
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:38,439

1499
01:12:38,439 --> 01:12:40,060
al

1500
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:45,279
al

1501
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:52,520
let's get a string of people together

1502
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:57,420
let's get a string of people together

1503
01:12:57,420 --> 01:13:00,640

uh... seven fifteen

1506
01:13:03,970 --> 01:13:08,550
flip that score out and you got a great score

1507
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:10,729
at this time to be different

1508
01:13:10,729 --> 01:13:20,890
this time will be different

1509
01:13:20,890 --> 01:13:24,100
you need to pray to the bruins
