1
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:12,310
I am back. Who's ready for Gotham Knights?

2
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:27,640
Did I scare you? I didn't mean to. Yeah, so I went to the bathroom, filled up my drink.

3
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:38,140
Very cool. Get the audio going. Make sure you can hear this.

4
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:44,700
All right, it's time to begin. This is a sponsored segment of today's stream.

5
00:00:44,700 --> 00:01:01,350
Like yesterday. Fix the BRB music. Yeah, I know.

6
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:14,439
Okay, let me make sure you can see it. There we go.

7
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:23,209
All right, let's get this over here. Where am I? Where did I go?

8
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:27,780
There I am. Facing the wrong direction. Let's flip that.

9
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:46,120
Bang. And now you will be able to see the game. There.

10
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:54,280
All right. We played yesterday. We were playing as Nightwing.

11
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,959
We're going to play as a different character today.

12
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,040
Thank you to Warner Brothers for sponsoring this part of the stream.

13
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,359
The game is out right now. It's out now.

14
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:10,659
Gotham Knights is on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S, Series X, and PC.

15
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:29,430
What was the last thing we did? All right, what character should I play as?

16
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,210
I want to play as a different character.

17
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,020
And I guess the question is, how do you change a character?

18
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,180
Play Red Hood? How do you change character?

19
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:48,659
Red Hood? All right, we'll do Red Hood today.

20
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,879
You have to ask.

21
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:04,199
There's definitely a way to do it, right? Did I not unlock that part yet?

22
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:09,830
Is it on the workbench? Do a poll?

23
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:12,219
Actually, you know what? All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:16,060
Let's do a poll. I want to play as a different character.

25
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:23,620
So do you want Robin, Red Hood, or Batgirl? Let's get a poll.

26
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:34,710
All right, let's open the Batcomputer.

27
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,270
So all right, yeah, this is the last thing we just did.

28
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,069
Harley Quinn called from Blackgate Penitentiary.

29
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:47,030
Oh, you have to go to the suits. All right, well, let's go take a look.

30
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,150
I'll give you a nice look at it so you can see what you're getting into here.

31
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,349
Suits are... Where are they? Here they are.

32
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,349
Okay, here you go.

33
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,919
We've been playing as Nightwing. We're going to play somebody else.

34
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:07,860
Robin. Robin has the big bow staff, and it's Robin.

35
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,819
Batgirl has... I think she throws stuff to get like...

36
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:31,500
Red Hood has guns, I think. What character are we doing?

37
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,779
Dude, Red Hood has guns. Yeah, whatever.

38
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:46,699
It's neck and neck. Batgirl and Red Hood. Robin is in last.

39
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:52,089
A lot of people are really kind of sleeping on Robin here.

40
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:53,699
I think Robin's probably going to be really good.

41
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,939
All right. Is it really that close? I can't see.

42
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,420
It's too close. Well, we're not doing it again.

43
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:38,180
Who's winning? 47%. That was close.

44
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,490
That was very close. Let me just tweet.

45
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:47,509
All right, we're doing Red Hood.

46
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,480
I threw? How?

47
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,759
Oh, all right. I probably should have done this.

48
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,060
Brute Strength Powerhouse Brawler Master Marksman 27 Power.

49
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,699
I should have done this.

50
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,660
Expert Hacker Tough as Nails Single Target Bruiser.

51
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,709
Well, we're doing it. Let's do Red Hood.

52
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:46,620
Oh, my. He's huge. He's massive.

53
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:51,350
All right. Let's start the patrol.

54
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:56,329
Oh, so yeah, I have a panel.

55
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:58,569
If you're interested, click the panel. Click the panel image.

56
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:02,649
You can buy it. Pre-order it.

57
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:04,490
Although the pre-order is over. I mean, it's out now.

58
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:18,550
It's literally out right now.

59
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,750
All right. I'm ready to begin.

60
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,189
Again, thank you Warner Brothers, sponsored.

61
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,310
Let's go. Time to protect Gotham City.

62
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:30,699
In case you want to use that anywhere.

63
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:32,939
Like you're absolutely more than welcome to.

64
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:34,699
You can if you want to use that clip.

65
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:36,300
Me, you know, get ready.

66
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:42,459
All right. I'm excited.

67
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:44,459
Actually, right when I started having fun

68
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:46,779
at Internet Problems last night, and that's not here right now.

69
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:52,839
So let's go. What is Red Hood's moves?

70
00:07:53,480 --> 00:08:00,220
Wait, I should look at. Hold on.

71
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,639
I want to see the. What's he got?

72
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,319
Abilities. All right. Hold on.

73
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:09,180
I have two points to put in because from my understanding,

74
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,779
when you level up any character,

75
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:13,660
you level all of them up essentially at the same time.

76
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,699
I guess that's to prevent you playing through the whole game

77
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:17,420
and being like, you know what?

78
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,139
I want to play as Batgirl, but I'm literally at zero

79
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:21,500
and I can't do anything.

80
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,459
So we have marksman, brawler and vengeance.

81
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:25,180
We have two points.

82
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,779
Red Hood performs a perfectly timed evade

83
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:29,579
that generates momentum.

84
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:34,259
We have that also critical damage by 20 percent.

85
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,759
Red Hood can aim longer at a target to deal four times damage.

86
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:39,960
I think that's what I want.

87
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,679
Should we do guns?

88
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,899
Definitely. I mean, perfect evade.

89
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,019
You need it and then guns.

90
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:50,340
If you the longer you aim, you do more damage.

91
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:57,190
Done. What are the other ones?

92
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,629
When Red Hood throws an enemy,

93
00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:01,669
he attaches a concussion mine to them that explodes.

94
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:03,370
That's pretty good.

95
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,409
That's three points.

96
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:09,779
Okay. I feel like I'm going to like this character.

97
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:13,460
Let's see. Is there like a little crime I can do just to learn his moveset?

98
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,629
There's got to be like a crime going on.

99
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:17,190
Yeah, over here.

100
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:30,730
Oh, shit. What happened?

101
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:34,230
No, get off the bike. What are you doing?

102
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:39,450
What happened? What happened here?

103
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:42,259
Do you need help? How do I help?

104
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:44,970
Was I too late?

105
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,320
How was I too late?

106
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,039
Did the criminals already get away?

107
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:57,509
I'm such a shitty superhero.

108
00:09:58,309 --> 00:09:59,029
Get back on the bike.

109
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:12,490
All right. Here we are.

110
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:17,179
Quiet. All right.

111
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:18,220
I'm going to dismount. Let's go.

112
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,610
I'm getting like texts.

113
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,529
My phone is just blowing up right now.

114
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,769
Red Hood, where are you, man?

115
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:32,840
Red Hood, your location says that you're over by like the...

116
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:35,960
Where are you? You're going the wrong way, dude.

117
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,899
Why does it say you're inside of the museum?

118
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,789
Just make a bunch of shit up.

119
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,620
I actually don't know where the fuck I'm going.

120
00:10:46,179 --> 00:11:00,679
There we go.

121
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,799
Okay, let's go.

122
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,940
What? Why am I shooting behind me?

123
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,559
How do I shoot?

124
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,110
All right, that's pretty cool.

125
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,289
Okay, this is awesome.

126
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:33,399
Man, is somebody just shooting at you?

127
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:42,299
What is this move?

128
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,870
Put this camera away.

129
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:04,419
I didn't even need to fucking look.

130
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:19,379
They're not even paying attention.

131
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:29,879
Yeah, I got a gun too.

132
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:38,809
Huh?

133
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,470
All right, I think I got the move set down.

134
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:50,840
I got points for that, right?

135
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,340
Paul Nightwing, he's crying.

136
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,139
No, we're Red Hood friends.

137
00:12:57,139 --> 00:12:57,639
No.

138
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,259
All right, I get it.

139
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:00,980
I get the move set.

140
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,779
I want to level those guns up.

141
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:06,980
By the way, there's gear in the game too.

142
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,990
So he doesn't have any gear.

143
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,690
Right.

144
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:12,549
Okay.

145
00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:14,629
Well, I guess I do have better stuff.

146
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,389
So these are better pistols.

147
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,409
We're going with the Beyond Suit.

148
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:25,850
I probably should have put the gear on before attacking anybody.

149
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,649
And what else?

150
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:31,149
Melee.

151
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:36,230
Cool.

152
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,110
All right, that's better.

153
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:48,649
All right, Harley Quinn.

154
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,570
I love how everybody can do a wheelie.

155
00:13:53,289 --> 00:14:03,590
I thought I could grab something.

156
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:14,730
I bet Robin can't do a wheelie.

157
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:15,289
Oh, please.

158
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:17,049
We'll find out.

159
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:23,399
Is Harley Quinn just sitting?

160
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:24,519
No, isn't Harley Quinn in the...

161
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,269
All right, let's do it.

162
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,990
This is probably a boss of some kind, I imagine.

163
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:47,590
That's this suit does look awesome.

164
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:52,519
And you see somebody walking down the fucking street like this?

165
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,230
Do an E3 walk.

166
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,440
What?

167
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,080
Wait, I'm not supposed to...

168
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,200
Oh, I'm not supposed to be here?

169
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,860
I'm not supposed to be here.

170
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,820
I'm just a guy in a huge superhero costume.

171
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,659
Just walking in the front door.

172
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,549
Ah, yeah.

173
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:31,429
Yeah, we got a guy in a fucking superhero outfit.

174
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:33,190
Walking into the front door.

175
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,549
Looks like he's armed.

176
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:35,990
How do we proceed?

177
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:40,940
What would you even say?

178
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:59,480
All right, let's do it.

179
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:12,460
Cassane, find a way into the prison.

180
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:25,740
I guess I have to get in here.

181
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:28,500
Belfry, I got in.

182
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,259
Next stop, Harley Cell.

183
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:36,009
The X on her map corresponds to Cell Block 3 past Nexus processing.

184
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:40,090
The guards have withdrawn their patrols from that block.

185
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:40,590
All right, let's...

186
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,269
So there's no telling how bad things have gotten in there.

187
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:45,230
Are there guards in here?

188
00:16:46,350 --> 00:17:01,210
Sure, he did.

189
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:05,019
I missed.

190
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:22,680
I'm getting another...

191
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:27,160
Red Hood, man!

192
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,880
What are you doing in there?

193
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:37,150
Wait, I shouldn't be...

194
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:37,950
We can't let Red Hood...

195
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:46,519
Am I gonna open this door with my bare hands?

196
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,140
Oh.

197
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:25,259
Wait, interrogate.

198
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,920
Interrogate, interrogate.

199
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,420
Did I?

200
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,960
I can't interrogate.

201
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,140
You've interrogated.

202
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,430
I love when he does the lip thing.

203
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:48,930
What do I do?

204
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,109
Yeah, Mike, I don't know why.

205
00:18:52,109 --> 00:18:53,630
Whenever I play Gotham Knights...

206
00:18:57,049 --> 00:18:58,410
I wonder why my webcam does this.

207
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,720
Well, this webcam stinks.

208
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,640
I don't think I want to do this.

209
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:14,940
Avoid taking damage.

210
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,019
Defeat all the invades and don't take any damage.

211
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:20,430
That's gonna be kind of hard.

212
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,670
All right, let me see if I can take some out before we get noticed.

213
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:27,359
And then let me play the stealth aspects of this game the way I'm supposed to.

214
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:33,450
Well, don't slam him on the ground.

215
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,049
Oh, shit.

216
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:46,490
Is there somebody just puke?

217
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,950
I think somebody just threw up.

218
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:05,200
Oh, no!

219
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,480
Whatever.

220
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:28,220
Did I shoot him in the face when I did that?

221
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:28,859
Holy shit.

222
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:46,839
Get out of here!

223
00:20:47,480 --> 00:21:01,160
Fucking scoop slam.

224
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:10,750
You were trying to...

225
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,430
Pursue him into the fire.

226
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,950
I was trying to go for an environmental...

227
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,319
Wait, is this it?

228
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:25,309
What do you know?

229
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,319
I feel like I would do something like that.

230
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,880
Looks like you've been eaten well.

231
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,099
Still as big as an ox and twice as mean.

232
00:21:54,569 --> 00:21:57,420
Been a while, you good?

233
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:00,190
So it is different.

234
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,029
Was it too much to ask you to visit earlier?

235
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:07,210
So each character has different dialogue with every encounter.

236
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:07,930
That's kind of cool.

237
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:10,000
What was it?

238
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:18,779
Hayden.

239
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:19,420
Are you real?

240
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,910
He asked me to profile some criminals.

241
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:39,230
On account of my being a brilliant psychiatrist.

242
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,960
Guess of all the criminals he knew...

243
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:45,210
You'd be the one to ask.

244
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:45,710
Hey!

245
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,930
I am not a criminal!

246
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,970
I'm misunderstood.

247
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,250
She's got a board up there too.

248
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:54,109
Look.

249
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,750
You know what I'm here for.

250
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,259
Hand it over.

251
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:05,000
He just grabbed the bars and he just rips the bars off the fucking wall

252
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,839
and he's got the whole thing in his hands and just throws it behind him.

253
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:13,950
But I'm missing my piece de resistance.

254
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:19,450
I need you to follow up on this here card.

255
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:26,490
It's hard to catch paper.

256
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:26,970
Holy shit.

257
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,609
That's the most impressive thing that we've seen a superhero do for the last two days.

258
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:30,650
You're not making this easy for me.

259
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,799
It should be done in records.

260
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:40,160
Bye.

261
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:58,240
Okay.

262
00:23:58,779 --> 00:24:02,200
Exit cell.

263
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:02,680
Block three.

264
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,880
So we're gonna go get whatever this is?

265
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:05,960
They're the inmates from the corridor.

266
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,759
All right.

267
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:07,569
We got it.

268
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:28,559
That guy's gonna accidentally hit me in the head.

269
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:31,680
Can he hit me in the head accidentally?

270
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,819
He's gonna like he's gonna hit me with his backswing.

271
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,519
Oh god damn it.

272
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:50,779
I'm glitching out.

273
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:51,900
I'm phasing out of reality.

274
00:24:52,539 --> 00:25:04,160
Okay.

275
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,960
Just get across.

276
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:16,049
All right.

277
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:30,779
All right.

278
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:31,579
I'm good.

279
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:39,960
The camera's fucked up.

280
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,480
There's an elevator in the nexus.

281
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,000
Maybe that goes down the basement.

282
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,170
What the heck's wrong with my camera?

283
00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:52,650
Let's keep doing that.

284
00:25:53,210 --> 00:26:04,480
Dude, you need more RAM.

285
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,680
Your VTuber model is...

286
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:08,809
Holy shit.

287
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:09,309
Okay.

288
00:26:15,819 --> 00:26:16,539
Oh my god.

289
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:18,240
Okay.

290
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,200
Momentum ability.

291
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,720
Enemy armored attacks can only be interrupted with piercing abilities such as barrage.

292
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:24,569
Gain momentum.

293
00:26:24,569 --> 00:26:25,289
And then I got...

294
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:25,529
Okay.

295
00:26:25,529 --> 00:26:26,170
I have a new move.

296
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:35,440
Holy shit, dude.

297
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,200
I shot you like 50 times.

298
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,349
Shoot behind you.

299
00:26:56,349 --> 00:26:57,150
Why am I not...

300
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,349
I'm so stupid.

301
00:26:58,349 --> 00:26:59,069
I'm trying to aim.

302
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:12,759
Geez.

303
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:13,000
All right.

304
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,500
Go.

305
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:27,000
I'm gonna get hit once.

306
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:34,140
Mm-hmm.

307
00:27:36,109 --> 00:27:57,069
Oh.

308
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,700
Another one.

309
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,259
Oh my god.

310
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:04,220
You're gonna get me in two hits.

311
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,250
Don't kill me.

312
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:17,950
Oh my god.

313
00:28:18,349 --> 00:28:20,589
Rocks.

314
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:26,329
Why would I have to defeat the guards?

315
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:28,369
Really?

316
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:29,599
No.

317
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:29,920
Why...

318
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,799
Defeat the guards?

319
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:31,299
I...

320
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:32,779
All right.

321
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:33,259
Fine.

322
00:28:33,259 --> 00:28:33,660
Okay.

323
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,160
I'll defeat...

324
00:28:41,869 --> 00:28:42,990
You actually got a hit on me.

325
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:46,990
Okay.

326
00:28:47,450 --> 00:29:11,930
The guards don't even have weapons.

327
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:12,730
I know.

328
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:13,609
This is so unfair.

329
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:19,579
Come here.

330
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:23,690
Had a choke slam.

331
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:24,809
That was fucking sick.

332
00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:39,099
Yeah, like those guys have bare fists.

333
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:46,759
I don't want anything to do with this.

334
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:47,960
I have no more healing, by the way.

335
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,519
This is bad.

336
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,880
Why would I even fight them?

337
00:29:56,599 --> 00:30:00,799
I'm all right.

338
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:10,349
How do you get more heals?

339
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:11,309
Are they just consumables?

340
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,279
Ooh.

341
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:17,779
Chest.

342
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:33,869
Can you stealth take down the big enemies?

343
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:54,359
He fell down.

344
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:08,700
Turn around.

345
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,789
Turn around.

346
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:35,549
Unload.

347
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:35,869
Unload.

348
00:31:35,869 --> 00:31:36,190
Unload.

349
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:36,589
Unload.

350
00:31:36,589 --> 00:31:36,910
Unload.

351
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:37,230
Unload.

352
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,190
Unload.

353
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:47,019
I'm trying to get the perfect strikes.

354
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:48,220
It's hard to do with Red Hood.

355
00:31:48,940 --> 00:32:04,880
Don't let him put the shield up.

356
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,240
Oh.

357
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:20,250
Low with the difficulty.

358
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:20,490
No.

359
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:20,730
No.

360
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,009
It's got to stay at hard.

361
00:32:22,009 --> 00:32:26,539
All right.

362
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:27,019
Records room.

363
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,509
Shoot them when they have the red flashing.

364
00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:40,329
Too smart to just send me on an errand after an old file.

365
00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:42,490
What do you want me to find out?

366
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,029
You're a hard gamer.

367
00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:46,269
Yeah.

368
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:49,920
I play games on hard.

369
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,039
No, actually, I kind of don't.

370
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:55,630
There's something more in this catalog.

371
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:56,029
Oh.

372
00:32:56,029 --> 00:33:03,920
Chest over there.

373
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,680
They're bullet spongy on hard.

374
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:13,289
It's got to get better weapons.

375
00:33:13,289 --> 00:33:14,730
Find and examine marked items.

376
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:15,230
Okay.

377
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:21,640
Prisoner profile.

378
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,519
Cyrus Gold.

379
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:23,559
Convict, they say.

380
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:24,440
Crook, they say.

381
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,240
Murderer, they say.

382
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,480
But soon peace will be mine.

383
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,359
Died on Saturday.

384
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:29,240
Buried on Sunday.

385
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,039
Born on Monday.

386
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:30,920
They have no idea.

387
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,880
Oh, I thought that was like a poem.

388
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:34,779
Is it?

389
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,019
Harley, how did you get access to the PA system?

390
00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:15,769
She's just on the PA?

391
00:34:15,769 --> 00:34:16,010
Okay.

392
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:16,409
There we go.

393
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:31,239
Scan the card catalog.

394
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:33,960
Index locations of all documents stored in the records room.

395
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:39,659
Okay.

396
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:40,219
Look at the...

397
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,090
Up here.

398
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:48,380
Over there.

399
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:52,409
Can I open that?

400
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:52,909
Analyze.

401
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,719
Bingo.

402
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,239
Here's what Harley was looking for.

403
00:34:57,389 --> 00:34:58,829
Here's your documents, Harley.

404
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:03,070
I think I found out all I can about this case.

405
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,710
I wonder what Harley will have to say about it.

406
00:35:06,429 --> 00:35:07,679
I'm going to open the door.

407
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:09,599
Potentially this is tied to what Batman was after.

408
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,800
This is a boss.

409
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,920
This has to be a boss fight, right?

410
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,360
I'm going to be fighting Harley Quinn.

411
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:30,000
How does Harley want from this file?

412
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:34,199
Mine is a maze, but it's still amazing.

413
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,960
She must have a good reason.

414
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:37,400
She's going to open the door.

415
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,199
She's going to take it from me.

416
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:39,559
And she's going to go like...

417
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:41,880
I can't do a Harley Quinn impression,

418
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,079
but it's going to be something like...

419
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:44,969
Oh!

420
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,050
I can't do a Harley Quinn impression.

421
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:58,119
Good job, everyone.

422
00:35:58,119 --> 00:35:59,320
You made things even worse.

423
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,880
It doesn't belong to you, dicks!

424
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,840
What are they even fighting?

425
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,179
All right.

426
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,960
Is this getting his head bashed in with a bat?

427
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:14,280
Look at how many times...

428
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,400
This is awful!

429
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:19,639
Oh my God!

430
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:27,679
Oh, shit!

431
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:28,800
That person's a psycho.

432
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,760
I'm coming.

433
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,260
Relax.

434
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,000
Where else do you need to be?

435
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,519
Do something?

436
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,199
What do you mean, do something?

437
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,679
I'm not supposed to protect every single citizen

438
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:48,719
as the title of the stream.

439
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,969
Never mind.

440
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,039
Why are they all fighting each other?

441
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:33,519
All right.

442
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:40,480
This guy is throwing lit toilet paper out the fucking window.

443
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,559
You guys are going to be real pissed off

444
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:51,880
once somebody in this prison has to take a shit.

445
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,440
Larry, did you have to throw 200 rolls of toilet paper?

446
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,039
You can just throw in one or two.

447
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:03,360
They're all doing it.

448
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,349
Please talk more.

449
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:09,440
I do these movements.

450
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,400
I do this like in the kitchen.

451
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:16,000
Is the pizza here?

452
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:26,239
What?

453
00:39:36,969 --> 00:39:37,769
Go, go, go!

454
00:39:37,769 --> 00:39:38,650
Chase the balloon, quick!

455
00:39:39,449 --> 00:39:44,030
Where did it go?

456
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:46,199
Where's the balloon?

457
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,599
That guy has two shattered ankles.

458
00:40:02,969 --> 00:40:04,010
Oh, shit!

459
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:04,650
It's mayhem!

460
00:40:06,889 --> 00:40:08,010
Where's the music coming from?

461
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,840
What am I doing?

462
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,960
To beat the riot?

463
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:30,619
To shoot the balloon down?

464
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:44,079
I don't even know who I'm attacking.

465
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,519
I'm just fighting random people.

466
00:40:55,309 --> 00:40:56,909
What the fuck was that?

467
00:40:56,909 --> 00:40:57,409
Hey!

468
00:40:57,949 --> 00:41:08,159
All right, I have to do that, though.

469
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:09,400
I have to do that.

470
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,519
I actually have to fight them.

471
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,090
I'm just going to stay back.

472
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:37,340
Who's throwing the lit toilet paper?

473
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,019
Because you're dead first.

474
00:41:39,659 --> 00:41:40,059
It's you.

475
00:41:40,059 --> 00:41:40,380
Get...

476
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:40,880
Okay.

477
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,239
Just kill this guy.

478
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:47,869
Hit him.

479
00:41:47,869 --> 00:41:48,829
Hit him.

480
00:41:48,829 --> 00:41:49,710
Somebody hit this guy.

481
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,800
This guy right here.

482
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,489
Stop.

483
00:41:56,489 --> 00:42:09,530
Get him.

484
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:09,929
Grab him!

485
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,980
All right.

486
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,380
Let's just be...

487
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,420
Hey, buddy, buddy, buddy.

488
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:15,900
Listen to me.

489
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,659
You and I are going to pretend to be fighting

490
00:42:17,659 --> 00:42:18,940
so people don't come and fucking fight us.

491
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,380
But we're going to get out of this alive together.

492
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,179
Just...

493
00:42:21,179 --> 00:42:21,739
Oh, fuck!

494
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:22,940
Dude, I got somebody.

495
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,579
Just pretend to be fighting.

496
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:24,619
No one's going to fight both of us.

497
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,619
Watch out.

498
00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:27,019
Watch out!

499
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,619
Oh, you piece of shit.

500
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,199
Over here.

501
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:30,920
Go over that way.

502
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,320
That way.

503
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:31,639
Over there.

504
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:36,139
Oh, shit.

505
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:36,619
I'm sorry.

506
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:45,480
What is the song?

507
00:42:49,869 --> 00:42:50,429
No!

508
00:42:50,429 --> 00:42:50,989
You killed...

509
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:56,840
I didn't even see...

510
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,039
All right.

511
00:42:58,039 --> 00:42:59,400
I'm going in hard now.

512
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,039
I'm going in hard.

513
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:01,559
I'm killing everybody in here.

514
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:02,440
No more messing around.

515
00:43:03,579 --> 00:43:04,940
I got hit directly.

516
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:05,659
All right.

517
00:43:05,659 --> 00:43:06,699
I'm going for it this time.

518
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,159
It's Livin' Lovita Loca.

519
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:11,820
All right.

520
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,059
Take...

521
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:21,099
Ow!

522
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:27,760
All right.

523
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,079
Goodbye.

524
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:44,909
Oh, shit.

525
00:43:58,239 --> 00:43:59,440
This is fucking crazy.

526
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,469
That guy's just taunting me.

527
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:05,389
Now, fuck you, man.

528
00:44:05,389 --> 00:44:06,190
Get out of the server.

529
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:08,030
Let somebody else play.

530
00:44:08,989 --> 00:44:11,389
There's three people trying to queue up to this place.

531
00:44:11,389 --> 00:44:11,789
And you're...

532
00:44:11,789 --> 00:44:12,110
Come on.

533
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:19,360
You thought you were going to hit me, didn't you?

534
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:29,530
I guess this guy's on fire.

535
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:39,630
I completely missed you.

536
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:44,489
Dude, are you seriously sitting there calling me a vigilante right now?

537
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:05,280
Don't...

538
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:13,099
I'm going to have to fight two huge people.

539
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:20,219
Nice teamwork.

540
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:20,699
You and me.

541
00:45:20,699 --> 00:45:21,019
You and me.

542
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:21,420
You and me.

543
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:40,699
Uh-oh.

544
00:45:40,699 --> 00:45:41,579
There's only two left.

545
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:43,900
Don't kill me, please.

546
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:51,610
Shit.

547
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:54,329
Oh, god damn it.

548
00:45:54,969 --> 00:45:55,690
Oh, my god.

549
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:58,010
I got fucking whirlwinded.

550
00:46:01,389 --> 00:46:02,030
Shit.

551
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:03,710
Oh, I'm actually fucking pissed.

552
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:05,070
I'm going to turn it down to medium.

553
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:06,030
I'm going to turn it down to medium.

554
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:06,989
I'm turning it down to medium.

555
00:46:06,989 --> 00:46:07,309
I'm sorry.

556
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:08,909
I'm turning it to medium.

557
00:46:08,909 --> 00:46:09,710
It's way too hard for me.

558
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:18,409
Just for this part.

559
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:19,289
Just for this part.

560
00:46:19,289 --> 00:46:19,530
My...

561
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:19,929
I don't have...

562
00:46:19,929 --> 00:46:20,489
I didn't have any...

563
00:46:20,489 --> 00:46:21,210
I didn't find any good...

564
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:22,090
I have to craft gear.

565
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:28,480
I was playing with Nightwing the whole game.

566
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,079
I don't have any...

567
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,840
I don't have any items for fucking Red Hood.

568
00:46:49,659 --> 00:46:50,059
Unload.

569
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,599
Oh, hell yeah.

570
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:54,320
That was perfect.

571
00:46:59,340 --> 00:46:59,739
Perfect.

572
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:10,010
All right.

573
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:11,449
We're fighting two different fights.

574
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:13,210
Just crossing into each other.

575
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:15,369
Why did that guy fall?

576
00:47:16,409 --> 00:47:23,880
Don't you dare kill me on medium.

577
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:37,639
No!

578
00:47:37,639 --> 00:47:37,880
No!

579
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:44,010
You are so much more powerful than me.

580
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:45,210
It's not fair.

581
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:45,369
You...

582
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:53,659
Okay.

583
00:47:53,659 --> 00:47:57,019
Well, per the rules of the superhero agreements,

584
00:47:57,099 --> 00:47:58,940
you are now part of the Gotham Knights.

585
00:47:59,869 --> 00:48:00,750
Congratulations.

586
00:48:01,469 --> 00:48:02,590
Oh, my fucking God.

587
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:05,119
That was so fucking funny.

588
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,920
Dude, you suck.

589
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:06,320
I'm...

590
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,760
I'm doing fine.

591
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,119
I'm doing just fine.

592
00:48:14,969 --> 00:48:15,289
All right.

593
00:48:15,289 --> 00:48:15,449
Get...

594
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:18,920
Look at...

595
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,199
She's destroying people.

596
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,480
I'm just staying back.

597
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:32,170
You fucking idiot.

598
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:33,130
Why would you...

599
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:33,690
Get him.

600
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:34,489
Kill him, not me.

601
00:48:34,489 --> 00:48:35,289
Why would you do that?

602
00:48:35,929 --> 00:48:47,710
I'll be back later.

603
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:48,349
I'll be back...

604
00:48:58,590 --> 00:48:58,989
Don't!

605
00:49:11,289 --> 00:49:13,070
Dude, I feel like I'm...

606
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:14,909
I feel like this opening was like a Royal Rumble.

607
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:32,400
No, not on the rematch.

608
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:38,570
No!

609
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:45,119
Please die!

610
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:46,239
Thank God.

611
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:46,800
Thank God.

612
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,280
Thank God.

613
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:47,519
All right.

614
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:47,760
We go.

615
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,079
We go.

616
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:48,320
We go.

617
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:48,480
We go.

618
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,519
We go.

619
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:59,289
Ow.

620
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:08,090
All right.

621
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:08,570
Let's go.

622
00:50:13,019 --> 00:50:13,340
Swing.

623
00:50:14,539 --> 00:50:15,500
Swing at me.

624
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,059
Swing at me.

625
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:18,670
Dumbass.

626
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:23,690
What's going on?

627
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:24,250
I had to reload.

628
00:50:24,969 --> 00:50:32,880
I mean, don't have fun without me.

629
00:50:33,519 --> 00:50:38,960
Watch out.

630
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:39,360
Watch out.

631
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:39,679
Big...

632
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:40,480
Big guy coming in.

633
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:04,400
Die!

634
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:12,880
Okay.

635
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:24,110
I did it.

636
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:24,349
Wait.

637
00:51:24,349 --> 00:51:25,550
The room is...

638
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:29,309
The camera is glitching and showing like other parts of my room.

639
00:51:29,309 --> 00:51:30,429
That's fucking hilarious.

640
00:51:36,519 --> 00:51:41,050
What the fuck is going on with my camera?

641
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:48,000
It's like putting my chin down here like this.

642
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,079
Dude, we can see your...

643
00:51:50,079 --> 00:52:04,000
No, you can't.

644
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:04,239
Okay.

645
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:14,670
We're good.

646
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:15,869
What is it?

647
00:52:15,869 --> 00:52:16,429
Oh, it's...

648
00:52:16,429 --> 00:52:16,829
Okay.

649
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:17,550
I see what it's doing.

650
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:18,349
That's fucking funny.

651
00:52:28,409 --> 00:52:28,730
All right.

652
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:29,610
Let me go pee.

653
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:30,329
Let me pee first.

654
00:52:30,329 --> 00:52:33,420
I'll be right back.

655
00:52:33,420 --> 00:57:07,000
I haven't peed.

656
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:07,500
Okay.

657
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:21,340
That was fucking funny.

658
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:21,980
That was fun.

659
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:28,239
I'd be lying to you if I didn't think that was an incredibly enjoyable experience.

660
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:28,480
All right.

661
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,860
So what is going on with my webcam?

662
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:33,659
Like, honest to God.

663
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:37,440
Why is it freaking out?

664
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,559
Why is it freaking out?

665
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:43,230
It doesn't make any sense.

666
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:44,190
Help us.

667
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:51,980
Yeah, it seems to only happen with...

668
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:52,539
I don't know what...

669
00:57:52,539 --> 00:57:56,110
It's something to do with how it's pulling in through OBS.

670
00:57:56,110 --> 00:58:03,130
I don't know.

671
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:04,170
Should I plug it back in?

672
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:09,519
I don't know.

673
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:10,800
Was this happening yesterday?

674
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,760
I don't remember this happening yesterday.

675
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:29,920
I remember it was glitching yesterday, but it was like teleporting around the room.

676
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:45,179
I bet you can't even remember what you were eating yesterday.

677
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:46,780
I do.

678
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:47,260
I remember.

679
00:58:53,389 --> 00:58:56,429
What the hell am I supposed to do with this, Harley?

680
00:58:56,429 --> 00:59:02,719
Crime weapon.

681
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:07,320
The camera's having an out-of-body experience.

682
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,159
Well, I'm sorry that's happening.

683
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:32,619
It really shouldn't be.

684
00:59:32,619 --> 00:59:34,619
But I'm going to turn it back on.

685
00:59:34,619 --> 00:59:44,829
We still freaking out?

686
01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:14,190
All right.

687
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:14,670
That was fun.

688
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:17,070
Let's keep moving.

689
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:20,909
Fix your hair.

690
01:00:24,639 --> 01:00:25,119
I just did.

691
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:29,039
All right.

692
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:29,599
So I get my...

693
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,199
I get my shit back.

694
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:35,789
Change it back to hard?

695
01:00:35,789 --> 01:00:36,030
No.

696
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:50,840
All right.

697
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:54,250
I'm just going to teleport back.

698
01:00:54,809 --> 01:00:57,000
That was a wild mission.

699
01:00:57,559 --> 01:01:02,619
I'm going to...

700
01:01:02,619 --> 01:01:03,739
Yeah, I'll keep it on medium.

701
01:01:03,739 --> 01:01:14,039
This is the AI reconstruction of your room.

702
01:01:14,039 --> 01:01:22,619
Why is there like another person?

703
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:31,369
There's another person here.

704
01:01:31,369 --> 01:01:32,090
Hold on.

705
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:36,880
I want to see what this looks like.

706
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:57,440
Let's see.

707
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:05,280
So this is an AI of the room?

708
01:02:06,809 --> 01:02:09,530
AI recreated the room.

709
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:10,250
Why is it...

710
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:12,349
What's the opacity for?

711
01:02:12,349 --> 01:02:24,199
Oh, right.

712
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:28,489
This looks like you took this picture in a submarine.

713
01:02:28,489 --> 01:02:33,159
Like this is my submarine streamer room.

714
01:02:33,159 --> 01:02:43,199
Yeah, why is there another person over here?

715
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:51,070
What is that?

716
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:53,900
I don't know.

717
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:54,219
All right.

718
01:02:54,219 --> 01:02:57,679
Well, interesting.

719
01:02:57,679 --> 01:03:00,320
I think maybe it thinks that's a mirror.

720
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:22,409
I imagine that's probably what it thinks.

721
01:03:22,409 --> 01:03:24,139
It's evil.

722
01:03:24,139 --> 01:03:24,699
I don't know.

723
01:03:24,699 --> 01:03:25,739
I have no idea, man.

724
01:03:25,739 --> 01:03:36,829
I think my OBS is crashing.

725
01:03:36,829 --> 01:03:40,639
What happened to my thing?

726
01:03:40,639 --> 01:03:51,579
Oh, there it is.

727
01:03:51,579 --> 01:03:53,420
I mean, I could just like unplug the webcam

728
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:55,449
and go without cam for a little while.

729
01:03:55,449 --> 01:03:57,369
If it's that annoying.

730
01:03:59,449 --> 01:04:00,539
Whatever.

731
01:04:00,539 --> 01:04:05,639
One crime stopped today.

732
01:04:05,639 --> 01:04:09,210
Not zero.

733
01:04:09,210 --> 01:04:09,769
At least one.

734
01:04:09,769 --> 01:04:15,239
We updated the board.

735
01:04:15,239 --> 01:04:15,480
All right.

736
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,039
Talk to Alfred.

737
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:26,909
Thinking about what happened at Blackgate, Master Jason?

738
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:29,949
I can't believe Harley got away.

739
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:31,150
She played us.

740
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:33,230
And I'm sure she's got more shit planned.

741
01:04:33,869 --> 01:04:36,829
She hasn't left any other messages or maps.

742
01:04:36,829 --> 01:04:39,710
Do you have any leads on where she might have gone?

743
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:40,269
Not really.

744
01:04:40,829 --> 01:04:43,309
But the freaks are usually your partners in crime.

745
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:45,630
A good place to stop, then.

746
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:55,179
OK, unloading clues.

747
01:04:57,019 --> 01:04:58,539
Open the book and examine the evidence.

748
01:04:58,539 --> 01:04:59,099
Is it up here?

749
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:00,619
There it is.

750
01:05:00,619 --> 01:05:01,179
Let's take a look.

751
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:09,920
Harley's profiled some seriously anti-social prisoners here.

752
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:13,920
Look, something's going on at Blackgate.

753
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,519
We lean on that warden.

754
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:16,079
We're set.

755
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,980
These records go back centuries, man.

756
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:21,019
The warden's new.

757
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:22,860
I doubt she's involved.

758
01:05:23,659 --> 01:05:27,880
How did I miss this?

759
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,010
All right.

760
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:32,480
Harley's stupid system makes no sense.

761
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:43,579
Hey, Babs, what did you figure out?

762
01:05:45,179 --> 01:05:47,900
They all got out on appeal.

763
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:49,420
That's what Harley was tracking.

764
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:53,820
In every case, key witnesses were murdered.

765
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:59,420
Look, they were all pinned up with knives, just like Langstrom.

766
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:02,250
Bruce is onto something.

767
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:03,550
Oh?

768
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:06,059
I think I've got something.

769
01:06:06,619 --> 01:06:10,960
Oswald Coppelpot, the Penguin.

770
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,039
He's like everyone else in here.

771
01:06:14,409 --> 01:06:18,730
Except he served his sentence every single time he was arrested.

772
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:21,289
Someone must have hung him out to dry.

773
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:23,210
Might be he's willing to talk.

774
01:06:23,849 --> 01:06:25,840
He runs the Iceberg Lounge now.

775
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,280
Claims he went legit.

776
01:06:28,159 --> 01:06:30,480
He definitely runs more than liquor through that bar.

777
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,400
I wouldn't know.

778
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,440
That man would never take me.

779
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:38,000
If you wanted a fake ID, Tim, all you had to do was ask.

780
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:41,760
Oswald's dangerous.

781
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,840
And we can't forget, Harley's still out there.

782
01:06:45,719 --> 01:06:47,619
Careful.

783
01:06:52,409 --> 01:06:54,570
Relax, dick.

784
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:57,929
We got this.

785
01:06:58,889 --> 01:07:04,360
So we're going after the Penguin?

786
01:07:05,159 --> 01:07:05,659
All right.

787
01:07:14,909 --> 01:07:16,909
Reach the Iceberg Lounge.

788
01:07:16,909 --> 01:07:17,409
We got it.

789
01:07:17,869 --> 01:07:20,559
Let me see what we got.

790
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:23,280
Should I do some more of just like crime fighting?

791
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:23,920
I feel like I should.

792
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:28,510
Secret identity compromised.

793
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:32,670
Protecting Batman's secret identity is vital to protecting Bruce Wayne's legacy.

794
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:37,559
Reach a specified location and plant fake information, giving Bruce Wayne an alibi.

795
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:40,280
If you're caught, you won't be able to plant the fake info again.

796
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:41,400
Until the next night.

797
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:44,300
Really?

798
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:45,019
Okay.

799
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:52,590
I'm getting overexposed here too.

800
01:07:52,590 --> 01:07:54,489
Go like this.

801
01:07:54,489 --> 01:07:59,659
I need to at least do like one or two.

802
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:00,699
I have to do at least a couple.

803
01:08:02,269 --> 01:08:05,000
Like crime stopping things.

804
01:08:17,319 --> 01:08:18,359
Drop the gamma on this.

805
01:08:19,770 --> 01:08:21,449
It's a little too overexposed.

806
01:08:29,130 --> 01:08:31,420
That's better.

807
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:32,140
That's better.

808
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:39,800
Okay, reach Iceberg Lounge.

809
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:40,359
What else is there?

810
01:08:41,319 --> 01:08:49,579
Only one of Gotham's rich and powerful has served actual prison time.

811
01:08:49,579 --> 01:08:52,380
Oswald Cobblepot, aka the Penguin.

812
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:53,100
Aim of visit.

813
01:08:53,739 --> 01:08:56,890
I think I have a point to put in.

814
01:08:56,890 --> 01:08:57,390
I do.

815
01:08:57,850 --> 01:09:01,920
Crit damage 20%.

816
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:11,340
What's the second thing on the third tier here?

817
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:16,720
Every round Red Hood shoots has a small chance to deal five times the damage.

818
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:19,600
Only applies to ranged attacks and precision aim.

819
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:20,100
Okay.

820
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:22,800
I need...

821
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:23,439
I'm not gonna do anything.

822
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:24,000
I need two points.

823
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:37,560
Again, this is a sponsored segment of the stream.

824
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,479
This is sponsored by Wanda Brothers.

825
01:09:40,199 --> 01:09:45,470
Gotham Knights is currently available right now on Xbox Series S,

826
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:51,390
Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, and PC, which I'm playing on right now with a 3090.

827
01:09:52,109 --> 01:09:53,659
It's an open world game.

828
01:09:54,539 --> 01:09:59,020
You can play as four different characters in the Batman universe.

829
01:09:59,659 --> 01:10:02,170
Currently playing as Red Hood.

830
01:10:02,729 --> 01:10:03,930
There is full co-op.

831
01:10:04,729 --> 01:10:07,930
Pretty cool.

832
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:18,010
Make the webcam bigger.

833
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:18,489
I don't know.

834
01:10:18,489 --> 01:10:19,050
It's too small.

835
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:34,680
Better take a different way in like Batman would.

836
01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:37,149
Go up in the roof.

837
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:44,939
Let me take a look.

838
01:10:44,939 --> 01:10:45,420
Hold on.

839
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:46,619
Let me see what it looks like.

840
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:54,239
Okay, cool.

841
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:55,600
Let's go beat up the penguin.

842
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,600
Let's punch him in the face a million times.

843
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:04,800
Wait, co-op is actually kind of nice.

844
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,079
There's like three co-op games.

845
01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:08,590
Yeah, that'd be the whole...

846
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:10,590
I think the whole purpose of the game is to do...

847
01:11:10,590 --> 01:11:14,109
To have just to jump in with a friend and just run around and solve crimes and stuff.

848
01:11:16,829 --> 01:11:17,710
Yeah, it's all co-op.

849
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:20,409
All right.

850
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:21,369
Talk to the penguin.

851
01:11:22,010 --> 01:11:24,640
The tax manual.

852
01:11:25,369 --> 01:11:25,869
Yeah.

853
01:11:26,090 --> 01:11:27,609
Like this guy pays taxes.

854
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:32,760
The coin with his name on it.

855
01:11:33,319 --> 01:11:34,680
This guy is something else.

856
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:37,930
Is he just in here?

857
01:11:38,729 --> 01:11:42,199
Is this like the penguin's club?

858
01:11:55,630 --> 01:11:56,989
Something's definitely shut up.

859
01:12:04,479 --> 01:12:05,199
What?

860
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:09,289
Was that quiet?

861
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:10,329
All right.

862
01:12:10,329 --> 01:12:11,369
That was silent apparently.

863
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:15,640
You were at where club...

864
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:22,829
All right.

865
01:12:22,829 --> 01:12:24,430
I just got one more guard.

866
01:12:24,989 --> 01:12:25,229
All right.

867
01:12:25,229 --> 01:12:25,630
Go down.

868
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:42,079
Whoops!

869
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:50,520
I pressed the wrong button.

870
01:12:51,319 --> 01:12:58,520
I pressed the wrong button.

871
01:13:04,119 --> 01:13:04,760
No, no, no, no, no.

872
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:05,239
Don't follow me.

873
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:18,680
You psycho!

874
01:13:23,659 --> 01:13:23,979
All right.

875
01:13:23,979 --> 01:13:24,380
Just get...

876
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:26,460
I can do that too, you know.

877
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:31,600
I need to do a silent takedown.

878
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:32,720
I got to drop aggro.

879
01:13:33,359 --> 01:13:52,199
I got to drop aggro.

880
01:13:52,199 --> 01:13:53,000
I got to drop aggro.

881
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:53,720
I want to get the bonus.

882
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,439
No, who cares?

883
01:13:57,439 --> 01:13:58,159
I'm going to just get you.

884
01:13:59,359 --> 01:14:02,189
How did you do that?

885
01:14:19,369 --> 01:14:19,869
Ooh.

886
01:14:22,010 --> 01:14:26,539
That's a broken face.

887
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:30,699
All right.

888
01:14:30,699 --> 01:14:31,579
Where's the penguin's office?

889
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:38,859
Can I grapple anything?

890
01:14:38,859 --> 01:14:39,359
Yeah.

891
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,079
It's locked.

892
01:14:47,079 --> 01:14:47,880
Really?

893
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:52,359
That door's sandalwood.

894
01:14:52,359 --> 01:14:53,079
Custom job.

895
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:56,189
Fixing it's going to be a pain in the ass.

896
01:14:56,189 --> 01:14:56,510
Yeah.

897
01:14:56,510 --> 01:14:59,149
Just answer my questions and I won't break anything else.

898
01:14:59,869 --> 01:15:00,430
Smile.

899
01:15:01,869 --> 01:15:06,989
Viral video of you assaulting Reformed Citizen is the last thing you need right now.

900
01:15:08,489 --> 01:15:09,289
Reformed?

901
01:15:13,399 --> 01:15:15,640
Guess all that time in Blackgate did the trick.

902
01:15:16,279 --> 01:15:21,039
Funny how you weren't able to weasel out of it like so many of your pals.

903
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:23,359
That is actually cool that everybody has their own dialogue

904
01:15:23,359 --> 01:15:25,119
because they have to record four different sessions.

905
01:15:25,119 --> 01:15:25,920
Someone's done their homework.

906
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:26,560
That's cool.

907
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,439
I want to know who's handing out get out of jail cards.

908
01:15:36,090 --> 01:15:38,170
If you really want to go down this rabbit hole,

909
01:15:38,170 --> 01:15:41,930
you need to know there's no coming back from it.

910
01:15:41,930 --> 01:15:43,289
Never stop me before.

911
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:46,329
Penguin, which Gotham bad guy do you think you are?

912
01:15:46,329 --> 01:15:48,010
I'm going to spell this out for you.

913
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:49,449
Well, I think I'm the Joker.

914
01:15:49,449 --> 01:15:51,100
With the bad guy.

915
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:51,659
Say it.

916
01:15:51,659 --> 01:15:54,890
You're not worth it.

917
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:55,449
Get lost.

918
01:16:05,210 --> 01:16:06,329
Because I'm the Riddler.

919
01:16:06,329 --> 01:16:07,289
That's who I think I am.

920
01:16:08,649 --> 01:16:16,119
Well, I can't just like grab him and like smash, smash, smash his head against the desk.

921
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:28,800
Oh, chess.

922
01:16:29,439 --> 01:16:32,920
Oh, wait, maybe he does think he's the Riddler.

923
01:16:41,689 --> 01:16:46,399
Guns.

924
01:16:46,399 --> 01:16:47,439
Wait, what is this painting?

925
01:16:57,979 --> 01:17:15,520
Okay.

926
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:17,760
Well, that's cool that we get to actually meet Penguin there.

927
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:20,399
I don't get to punch him in the face.

928
01:17:21,039 --> 01:17:26,060
Is Penguin that old?

929
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:32,140
I mean, I think Bruce Wayne looked a little older in this.

930
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:33,500
He looked like he was like older.

931
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:36,380
So I think this is takes place kind of maybe a little bit later.

932
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:51,470
He uh, well, all right, turn to the bell.

933
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:53,390
Belfry.

934
01:17:53,390 --> 01:17:54,989
Penguin was a dead end.

935
01:17:54,989 --> 01:17:56,829
Whatever he knows, he's not telling.

936
01:17:57,550 --> 01:18:00,859
I had to come back to the Belfry and we'll regroup.

937
01:18:00,859 --> 01:18:02,960
Sounds good.

938
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,090
Thanks.

939
01:18:04,090 --> 01:18:06,649
No, no, I'm not doing that.

940
01:18:07,210 --> 01:18:08,569
I'm going to stop some crimes.

941
01:18:08,569 --> 01:18:10,890
I'm not going to be zero crime prevented Andy.

942
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:13,960
We're stopping some crimes.

943
01:18:15,739 --> 01:18:17,819
Otherwise, am I even a superhero at this point?

944
01:18:17,819 --> 01:18:21,180
Like I need to protect the like the community and stuff.

945
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:22,699
So I'm going to let's go.

946
01:18:26,170 --> 01:18:27,609
This one's right here.

947
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:30,090
There's some people stealing shit over here.

948
01:18:30,970 --> 01:18:48,909
Okay, let's do it.

949
01:18:49,630 --> 01:18:54,590
What's up?

950
01:19:01,149 --> 01:19:01,470
Look at this.

951
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:02,350
What's this huge guy?

952
01:19:02,989 --> 01:19:04,430
He's got like a jet pack on.

953
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:22,840
What the fuck?

954
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:25,119
Holy okay.

955
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:36,220
Electricity guy.

956
01:19:44,439 --> 01:19:53,789
No, I didn't get it off.

957
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:54,289
Shit.

958
01:19:54,750 --> 01:20:12,579
Ow.

959
01:20:14,829 --> 01:20:15,470
All right.

960
01:20:15,470 --> 01:20:16,430
Crime stopped.

961
01:20:17,149 --> 01:20:17,649
I did it.

962
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:20,239
I prevented the crime.

963
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:25,000
Let me do one more.

964
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:29,930
There is a big one going on over there.

965
01:20:30,649 --> 01:20:32,840
I need one behind me.

966
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:36,399
There's a chest over there.

967
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:37,520
I need to do at least two.

968
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:43,960
Should I get the chest?

969
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:45,399
I want that chest.

970
01:20:45,399 --> 01:20:45,899
I'm getting it.

971
01:20:46,439 --> 01:20:51,520
Check your gear upgrades.

972
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:57,520
Holy shit.

973
01:20:58,159 --> 01:20:59,600
44 defense.

974
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:20,890
This thing's pretty sick.

975
01:21:20,890 --> 01:21:23,050
I wonder how many outfits there are for each character.

976
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:27,289
So that's this is I'm just gonna run up by a car.

977
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:31,609
You don't know if they don't recognize me

978
01:21:31,609 --> 01:21:33,050
because I'm in a different costume.

979
01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:34,010
It's me the red hood.

980
01:21:34,649 --> 01:21:35,609
I'm trying a different look.

981
01:21:35,609 --> 01:21:36,970
I'm trying a new outfit

982
01:21:36,970 --> 01:21:38,010
and I think it looks pretty good.

983
01:21:39,119 --> 01:21:43,039
It's equally scary but equally I've got authority

984
01:21:43,039 --> 01:21:48,350
and I have you know you don't want to take a picture

985
01:21:48,350 --> 01:21:49,710
for your Instagram or anything.

986
01:21:49,710 --> 01:21:55,079
You would have taken a picture with the fucking Batman.

987
01:21:55,079 --> 01:21:55,579
Wouldn't you?

988
01:21:56,199 --> 01:22:13,310
All right, here we go straight ahead.

989
01:22:13,949 --> 01:22:14,909
Crime in progress.

990
01:22:15,789 --> 01:22:24,270
I'm on it.

991
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:30,180
Stop.

992
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:33,680
Stop.

993
01:22:34,779 --> 01:22:35,579
Look what we have.

994
01:22:35,579 --> 01:22:36,079
It's me.

995
01:22:47,949 --> 01:22:49,229
I've reloaded and shot him.

996
01:22:49,869 --> 01:22:52,930
I actually like this outfit.

997
01:22:53,489 --> 01:22:58,109
All right.

998
01:22:58,109 --> 01:22:58,979
Crime.

999
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:03,199
Crime stopped.

1000
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:07,810
That counts, right?

1001
01:23:08,449 --> 01:23:19,380
Oh, there's another one right here.

1002
01:23:19,939 --> 01:23:22,000
Right down the street.

1003
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:36,140
How did I just get in here?

1004
01:23:36,699 --> 01:23:40,819
Where am I?

1005
01:23:40,819 --> 01:23:41,939
I'm like in the sewers.

1006
01:23:41,939 --> 01:23:42,979
How did I get in here?

1007
01:23:43,619 --> 01:23:49,229
There's a loot box down here.

1008
01:23:49,869 --> 01:23:51,119
Yeah, there is.

1009
01:23:51,119 --> 01:23:51,920
I'll get it.

1010
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:55,710
Is this a loot box?

1011
01:23:56,430 --> 01:23:58,130
What is this?

1012
01:23:58,130 --> 01:24:07,220
That was not a loot box.

1013
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:08,659
Criminal activity.

1014
01:24:08,659 --> 01:24:09,539
I didn't do anything.

1015
01:24:09,539 --> 01:24:10,579
I didn't prevent any crimes.

1016
01:24:12,819 --> 01:24:13,939
I think they have to be the big ones.

1017
01:24:20,689 --> 01:24:22,689
All right, let's keep, we'll keep, we'll keep it rolling.

1018
01:24:22,689 --> 01:24:24,579
Let's keep it rolling.

1019
01:24:24,579 --> 01:24:31,890
All the AI images.

1020
01:24:31,890 --> 01:24:33,250
Yeah, they're looking fucking weird.

1021
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:43,899
You didn't prevent anything.

1022
01:24:43,899 --> 01:24:48,510
You were just killing people.

1023
01:24:48,510 --> 01:24:49,229
All right, what do you got, Al?

1024
01:24:51,329 --> 01:24:52,609
Penguin kept his mouth shut.

1025
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:55,010
Batman made this stuff look easy.

1026
01:24:56,180 --> 01:25:00,979
You may be surprised to learn Batman struggled with similar challenges early in his career.

1027
01:25:01,859 --> 01:25:05,699
So for a time, he focused his energies elsewhere in the city.

1028
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:09,779
When word of his work got out, people were more inclined.

1029
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:10,899
To cooperate.

1030
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:12,899
The city.

1031
01:25:13,699 --> 01:25:17,460
We've been so wrapped up in Batman's last case, we ignored the rest of Gotham.

1032
01:25:18,739 --> 01:25:20,020
Gotham may not know Batman is gone.

1033
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:23,300
I always feel like Red Hood is about to punch whoever he's talking to.

1034
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:28,500
There has been a marked increase in gang-related crime.

1035
01:25:29,779 --> 01:25:34,100
Plus whatever shit Penguin's up to these days, maybe if we mess with him.

1036
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:36,500
And if we look at crooks, they'll feel like talking.

1037
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:42,739
You've also received messages from Lucius Fox and Detective Montoya.

1038
01:25:42,739 --> 01:25:43,939
They may be able to help.

1039
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:46,100
Thanks, Alfred.

1040
01:25:46,899 --> 01:25:49,539
Guess it's time to take a page out of Batman's book.

1041
01:25:50,819 --> 01:25:53,300
I promise it's an excellent read.

1042
01:25:53,859 --> 01:25:54,180
Okay.

1043
01:25:57,329 --> 01:25:57,970
New email.

1044
01:25:58,609 --> 01:26:01,140
Oh my god, I'm not...

1045
01:26:01,859 --> 01:26:09,069
I mean, I haven't read any of these.

1046
01:26:09,069 --> 01:26:10,909
Batman sent me a fucking email?

1047
01:26:11,550 --> 01:26:12,270
What?

1048
01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:13,470
I got an email from Batman.

1049
01:26:14,109 --> 01:26:20,560
If you received this message, then people have started linking the words Bruce,

1050
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,399
Wayne, and Batman online.

1051
01:26:22,399 --> 01:26:23,439
Which means my idea...

1052
01:26:25,140 --> 01:26:28,319
You think he knows that people are searching?

1053
01:26:28,319 --> 01:26:34,140
As you might understand, the Google Trends search is looking like Bruce,

1054
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:35,420
Wayne, and Batman together.

1055
01:26:36,220 --> 01:26:39,100
I'm seeing a lot more of those in October of 2022.

1056
01:26:46,270 --> 01:26:49,069
Okay, so sorry I missed the email, Batman.

1057
01:26:52,510 --> 01:26:54,109
Our PR problem?

1058
01:26:54,109 --> 01:26:58,899
We have a reputation problem.

1059
01:26:58,899 --> 01:27:04,020
What with citizens of Gotham running at the very side of us and the GCPD hating our guts?

1060
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:06,340
Mr. Dorius, my history teacher, used to say,

1061
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:07,859
people fear what they don't understand.

1062
01:27:07,859 --> 01:27:09,939
I think I've come up with the perfect solution to our PR problem.

1063
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:11,619
We start a podcast.

1064
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:15,600
No.

1065
01:27:18,130 --> 01:27:20,130
Now, now, let's not be so quick to judge.

1066
01:27:20,130 --> 01:27:21,729
What exactly are you proposing, Tim?

1067
01:27:22,369 --> 01:27:26,260
I haven't gotten quite that far yet.

1068
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:29,380
Maybe it's the four of us debunking myths about what we do

1069
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:30,899
or debriefing our latest case.

1070
01:27:30,899 --> 01:27:32,340
We could answer listener questions.

1071
01:27:32,899 --> 01:27:35,680
We call it Podcast Nights or Bat Chat.

1072
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,680
We can workshop the name, but I think it's a good idea.

1073
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:41,840
We even already have fun interpersonal dynamics and banter,

1074
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,949
which is the perfect for audio.

1075
01:27:43,949 --> 01:27:44,189
No.

1076
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:46,539
See, we're already doing it.

1077
01:27:46,539 --> 01:27:50,699
Whenever you're being a party pooper, I'll just be like classic Red Hood.

1078
01:27:50,699 --> 01:27:52,539
If people will love it, we could do t-shirts.

1079
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:08,420
I'm playing as Robin.

1080
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:10,539
I'm going to play as Robin.

1081
01:28:30,779 --> 01:28:32,619
Realize I forgot to send flowers.

1082
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:35,899
We're in the neighborhood.

1083
01:28:35,899 --> 01:28:37,020
Let's meet in my building.

1084
01:28:38,050 --> 01:28:39,489
I'd like to give you them impression.

1085
01:28:43,899 --> 01:28:45,979
Lucius Fox wants to give us flowers.

1086
01:28:46,699 --> 01:28:47,979
Does he know couriers exist?

1087
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:53,949
Knowing Lucius, I suspect he has something far more useful for us.

1088
01:28:53,949 --> 01:28:54,270
Okay.

1089
01:28:56,430 --> 01:28:57,710
Head straight to the roof.

1090
01:28:58,430 --> 01:29:04,100
Check the evidence board.

1091
01:29:04,979 --> 01:29:05,779
Nightwing is fun.

1092
01:29:05,779 --> 01:29:06,579
Red Hood is fun, too.

1093
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:07,920
Watch.

1094
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:08,800
I'm going to play as Robin.

1095
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:14,060
It's going to be my favorite character.

1096
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:14,619
Okay.

1097
01:29:14,619 --> 01:29:16,590
I got some new stuff here.

1098
01:29:17,149 --> 01:29:20,859
Penguin's criminal deal.

1099
01:29:22,510 --> 01:29:24,510
Penguin's organ trafficking.

1100
01:29:24,510 --> 01:29:27,939
Lucius Fox.

1101
01:29:27,939 --> 01:29:29,460
Detective Montoya.

1102
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:29,779
Okay.

1103
01:29:30,340 --> 01:29:33,520
There's a lot of stuff to do.

1104
01:29:34,079 --> 01:29:36,689
Harley returns.

1105
01:29:37,409 --> 01:29:39,739
Freaks have been teaming up with some unexpected allies.

1106
01:29:39,739 --> 01:29:41,420
Investigate their crimes to find out what's going on.

1107
01:29:41,420 --> 01:29:44,020
We got to do some interrogations.

1108
01:29:52,369 --> 01:29:52,609
Okay.

1109
01:29:55,710 --> 01:29:56,909
Time to patrol Gotham City.

1110
01:29:56,909 --> 01:29:57,229
I want...

1111
01:29:57,229 --> 01:29:58,670
What do I want to track?

1112
01:29:58,670 --> 01:30:00,340
What do you want?

1113
01:30:00,340 --> 01:30:00,979
What do I want to do?

1114
01:30:01,699 --> 01:30:02,340
Let's do...

1115
01:30:05,779 --> 01:30:06,420
What do you want to do?

1116
01:30:06,979 --> 01:30:07,779
Who should I go for?

1117
01:30:07,779 --> 01:30:08,420
Harley Quinn or...

1118
01:30:10,060 --> 01:30:19,039
Penguin.

1119
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:19,680
Because there's...

1120
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:24,300
Harley?

1121
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:24,939
Penguin?

1122
01:30:24,939 --> 01:30:25,819
I'm seeing a lot of people say...

1123
01:30:25,819 --> 01:30:28,939
Let me just see who has a cooler potential plan here.

1124
01:30:30,579 --> 01:30:31,300
Yeah.

1125
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:32,020
So let me see.

1126
01:30:32,819 --> 01:30:37,539
Stop a criminal deal to interfere with the Penguin's activities in Gotham City.

1127
01:30:37,539 --> 01:30:38,340
So that's like...

1128
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:39,380
That's a Penguin marker.

1129
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:41,840
Tracking an activity.

1130
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:45,119
Stop an organ trafficking operation to interfere with the Penguin's activities.

1131
01:30:45,119 --> 01:30:46,880
All right.

1132
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:47,680
Let's go do this.

1133
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:50,079
Let's go stop some organ trafficking.

1134
01:30:50,079 --> 01:30:57,579
What's this?

1135
01:30:57,579 --> 01:31:03,810
I'm eating like a can of soup out of the can?

1136
01:31:06,859 --> 01:31:07,340
What?

1137
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:10,750
I was just thinking of that time we all made dinner together,

1138
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:13,789
and Tim got tomato sauce all over a bruised bass.

1139
01:31:14,590 --> 01:31:17,180
I don't remember that.

1140
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:17,819
What?

1141
01:31:17,819 --> 01:31:18,380
You just eat it.

1142
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:19,100
No, you have to.

1143
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:19,899
It was the same year...

1144
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:23,279
You know what?

1145
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:24,720
Never mind.

1146
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:26,880
Dumb story anyway.

1147
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:30,079
Well, I could tell you a story.

1148
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,159
It's about being dead,

1149
01:31:33,039 --> 01:31:35,920
then brought back to life by a pit of mind-altering goo.

1150
01:31:37,250 --> 01:31:38,930
Hey, I didn't mean...

1151
01:31:38,930 --> 01:31:39,970
I don't know what's worse.

1152
01:31:40,850 --> 01:31:43,010
Having a chunk of my life taken away from me

1153
01:31:43,170 --> 01:31:45,329
or coming back to everyone thinking I'm gonna snap.

1154
01:31:46,210 --> 01:31:52,210
I'm sorry, Jason.

1155
01:31:52,770 --> 01:31:53,899
We shouldn't have.

1156
01:31:56,399 --> 01:31:58,399
I shouldn't have treated you like an outsider.

1157
01:31:59,039 --> 01:32:09,699
My god, you're such a boy scout.

1158
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:12,859
No wonder you were the first.

1159
01:32:22,460 --> 01:32:24,340
Dude, you gotta clean and peel that thing.

1160
01:32:24,899 --> 01:32:26,500
You gotta clean and peel that carrot.

1161
01:32:34,239 --> 01:32:34,739
Let's go.

1162
01:32:46,159 --> 01:32:47,359
Didn't peel the carrot.

1163
01:32:47,359 --> 01:32:48,479
Didn't peel the carrot.

1164
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:54,979
All right, it's time...

1165
01:32:55,699 --> 01:32:57,489
Stop some crime.

1166
01:33:01,899 --> 01:33:02,939
What do I want to do?

1167
01:33:04,619 --> 01:33:05,340
This, right?

1168
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:05,840
Okay.

1169
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:09,020
Stop Penguin's criminal deal and to get his attention.

1170
01:33:10,539 --> 01:33:11,260
I'm doing this.

1171
01:33:16,670 --> 01:33:17,550
Let's get the Peng...

1172
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:18,989
Let's mess with the Penguin.

1173
01:33:27,020 --> 01:33:27,520
Robin?

1174
01:33:27,979 --> 01:33:32,180
I'll switch to Robin in like 10 minutes.

1175
01:33:53,489 --> 01:33:53,989
That's me.

1176
01:33:54,770 --> 01:34:11,470
I don't even want to go this way.

1177
01:34:12,029 --> 01:34:16,130
Do I want to go this way?

1178
01:34:19,470 --> 01:34:20,750
Oh, because I have to go across the bridge.

1179
01:34:20,750 --> 01:34:21,470
Right, right, right, right.

1180
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:29,600
Hey!

1181
01:34:47,899 --> 01:34:49,020
Oh, okay.

1182
01:34:50,220 --> 01:34:50,720
Got him.

1183
01:34:53,979 --> 01:34:54,779
Crime prevented.

1184
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:03,020
You're welcome.

1185
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:06,989
Stop murdering people.

1186
01:35:08,670 --> 01:35:09,550
What am I supposed to do?

1187
01:35:09,550 --> 01:35:10,050
Just run?

1188
01:35:10,829 --> 01:35:49,859
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1189
01:35:49,859 --> 01:35:50,579
There we go.

1190
01:35:51,380 --> 01:35:51,880
One more.

1191
01:36:01,390 --> 01:36:02,670
All right, defeat all enemies,

1192
01:36:02,670 --> 01:36:04,189
retrieve the mod chips,

1193
01:36:04,189 --> 01:36:17,229
and do grab strikes.

1194
01:36:17,229 --> 01:36:17,869
10 enemies.

1195
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:27,359
Wait, there's stuff over here.

1196
01:36:28,079 --> 01:36:43,420
Nice.

1197
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:44,220
That's my favorite move.

1198
01:36:46,850 --> 01:36:47,350
What's up?

1199
01:36:48,050 --> 01:36:56,100
All right, I gotta interrogate somebody.

1200
01:36:56,819 --> 01:37:16,180
Nice try.

1201
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:25,699
Don't kill the level five.

1202
01:37:25,699 --> 01:37:27,220
Oh my god, Jeremy.

1203
01:37:48,590 --> 01:37:49,090
Shit.

1204
01:37:49,390 --> 01:37:54,369
I think there's still a high level over here too.

1205
01:37:58,689 --> 01:37:59,189
Or...

1206
01:38:10,430 --> 01:38:12,130
I wanted to grab him.

1207
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:24,600
Who's left?

1208
01:38:35,180 --> 01:38:35,899
Oh, you're here.

1209
01:38:38,140 --> 01:38:50,270
What do you know about the penguin?

1210
01:38:51,279 --> 01:38:51,779
Whatever.

1211
01:38:52,239 --> 01:38:58,689
All right, there's another one.

1212
01:38:58,689 --> 01:39:09,680
Penguin's organ trafficking.

1213
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:10,800
All right, we're gonna do this one now.

1214
01:39:11,659 --> 01:39:12,300
It's pretty close.

1215
01:39:41,789 --> 01:39:42,510
Have a nice night.

1216
01:39:46,770 --> 01:39:48,289
I spawned right in front of that guy.

1217
01:39:49,979 --> 01:39:50,619
One guy.

1218
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:00,819
God damn it.

1219
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:05,460
All right.

1220
01:40:06,079 --> 01:40:08,079
Make sure I interrogate somebody.

1221
01:40:08,079 --> 01:40:08,960
It's really important.

1222
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:31,069
They put that wall there just so you would run into it.

1223
01:40:31,069 --> 01:40:37,340
Should I just go...

1224
01:40:37,340 --> 01:40:38,699
What if I went the speed limit?

1225
01:40:38,699 --> 01:41:14,829
Let's go.

1226
01:41:14,829 --> 01:41:15,329
All right.

1227
01:41:15,869 --> 01:41:17,630
I have to interrogate someone.

1228
01:41:17,630 --> 01:41:21,579
Level five, right here.

1229
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:23,039
Here it comes.

1230
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:39,680
No interrogate?

1231
01:41:41,039 --> 01:41:49,010
What do you know?

1232
01:41:59,250 --> 01:42:00,050
Where's the container?

1233
01:42:00,770 --> 01:42:05,550
Oh, that's a plaque.

1234
01:42:05,550 --> 01:42:06,590
I have one minute?

1235
01:42:06,590 --> 01:42:07,470
Get away from me.

1236
01:42:08,739 --> 01:42:09,460
Get out of the way.

1237
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:14,270
Where's the...

1238
01:42:14,270 --> 01:42:14,829
Where are the organs?

1239
01:42:14,829 --> 01:42:15,329
Where are they?

1240
01:42:24,579 --> 01:42:25,079
What?

1241
01:42:28,449 --> 01:42:29,489
Drop site, drop site, drop site.

1242
01:42:29,489 --> 01:42:29,989
Where is it?

1243
01:42:30,609 --> 01:42:33,149
I gotta go right now.

1244
01:42:33,869 --> 01:42:50,680
I got him.

1245
01:43:07,939 --> 01:43:08,659
I've got organs.

1246
01:43:09,619 --> 01:43:11,460
Do I give it to you?

1247
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:13,359
All right, we're good.

1248
01:43:22,449 --> 01:43:23,810
Thanks for the delivery.

1249
01:43:23,810 --> 01:43:25,810
I've got a medical team lined up who can use it.

1250
01:43:26,770 --> 01:43:28,130
Glad I got here in time, man.

1251
01:43:29,229 --> 01:43:29,789
Nice.

1252
01:43:29,789 --> 01:43:30,109
All right.

1253
01:43:30,109 --> 01:43:32,350
So I'm messing with penguins still.

1254
01:43:33,149 --> 01:43:35,069
And is he pissed now?

1255
01:43:35,869 --> 01:43:42,819
Wait.

1256
01:43:54,819 --> 01:43:55,859
Why do they have a pig mask?

1257
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:08,760
True.

1258
01:44:09,060 --> 01:44:12,449
Interrogate.

1259
01:44:12,449 --> 01:44:12,949
Nope.

1260
01:44:13,489 --> 01:44:16,979
They have spray paint?

1261
01:44:18,340 --> 01:44:19,779
All right.

1262
01:44:19,779 --> 01:44:20,979
I'm just gonna throw you all in the ocean.

1263
01:44:35,140 --> 01:44:44,319
Come here.

1264
01:44:47,899 --> 01:44:48,399
Yep.

1265
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:50,079
Just go into the water already.

1266
01:44:52,149 --> 01:44:52,649
It hurt.

1267
01:44:53,909 --> 01:44:54,789
There's not water.

1268
01:45:03,239 --> 01:45:03,739
Oh.

1269
01:45:04,439 --> 01:45:07,039
I'm kind of afraid to jump in there.

1270
01:45:14,239 --> 01:45:14,560
All right.

1271
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:21,119
So now we've got citizen chaos.

1272
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:24,149
There's also...

1273
01:45:24,149 --> 01:45:25,350
Oh, Lucius box.

1274
01:45:25,350 --> 01:45:31,119
Fast travel, I think.

1275
01:45:31,119 --> 01:45:32,239
That's a fast travel unlock.

1276
01:45:36,130 --> 01:45:37,810
See what Detective Montoya wants.

1277
01:45:38,369 --> 01:45:42,850
Robbery in progress.

1278
01:45:43,489 --> 01:45:45,810
Probably this, right?

1279
01:45:48,159 --> 01:45:48,479
Oh, yeah.

1280
01:45:48,479 --> 01:45:49,359
I'll switch to Robin.

1281
01:45:49,359 --> 01:45:50,529
I'll switch to Robin.

1282
01:45:51,090 --> 01:45:55,159
Yeah, let's do that.

1283
01:45:55,159 --> 01:45:56,199
Let's check out...

1284
01:45:56,199 --> 01:45:57,640
I want to be able to play all the characters.

1285
01:45:58,199 --> 01:46:04,369
I want to do all the characters.

1286
01:46:04,369 --> 01:46:05,329
So you can vote.

1287
01:46:05,329 --> 01:46:06,210
See, two crimes stopped.

1288
01:46:06,210 --> 01:46:10,130
I'm good.

1289
01:46:10,130 --> 01:46:11,170
18 enemies defeated.

1290
01:46:11,170 --> 01:46:12,289
Two silent taketowns.

1291
01:46:12,289 --> 01:46:16,689
Yeah.

1292
01:46:16,689 --> 01:46:17,250
All right.

1293
01:46:17,250 --> 01:46:18,899
Get a poll in here.

1294
01:46:18,899 --> 01:46:23,890
Batgirl or Robin for the last portion of the sponsor segment.

1295
01:46:23,890 --> 01:46:28,119
Which, by the way, WB, thanks again for the sponsorship.

1296
01:46:28,119 --> 01:46:34,920
Game's available right now.

1297
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:36,680
I got a link in the panel below.

1298
01:46:37,239 --> 01:46:42,979
Who do you want to save for the next 30 minutes or so?

1299
01:46:42,979 --> 01:46:49,039
I have to pee again.

1300
01:46:49,039 --> 01:46:51,199
I keep needing to pee.

1301
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:55,489
Well, I'm drinking a lot of water.

1302
01:46:55,489 --> 01:46:56,130
All right.

1303
01:46:56,130 --> 01:46:57,090
I'll be back when the poll's done.

1304
01:46:57,890 --> 01:46:58,449
One more pee.

1305
01:46:59,090 --> 01:48:34,159
All right.

1306
01:48:34,159 --> 01:48:37,569
How are we doing?

1307
01:48:37,569 --> 01:48:38,210
Batgirl.

1308
01:48:38,210 --> 01:48:38,850
All right.

1309
01:48:38,850 --> 01:48:41,729
I'll play Robin tomorrow.

1310
01:48:41,729 --> 01:48:51,619
I'll play a combination of them both.

1311
01:48:51,619 --> 01:49:03,840
That's fair.

1312
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:04,470
All right.

1313
01:49:04,470 --> 01:49:05,430
Let's do Batgirl.

1314
01:49:05,430 --> 01:49:19,170
There are four characters.

1315
01:49:19,170 --> 01:49:20,850
Robin's the only one we are not going to see tonight,

1316
01:49:20,850 --> 01:49:23,010
but you'll see Batgirl and Robin tomorrow.

1317
01:49:23,010 --> 01:49:25,560
You promised us Robin.

1318
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:27,319
WB, you got to save the best for last.

1319
01:49:27,319 --> 01:49:39,250
You saved the best for last.

1320
01:49:39,250 --> 01:49:51,079
Play as Alfred.

1321
01:49:51,079 --> 01:49:52,760
I don't think you can play as Alfred.

1322
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:56,869
All right.

1323
01:49:56,869 --> 01:49:57,350
Batgirl.

1324
01:50:02,369 --> 01:50:04,920
Expert hacker.

1325
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:06,039
Let's do it.

1326
01:50:12,930 --> 01:50:16,130
Oh, I was like, wait, where's my costume?

1327
01:50:16,130 --> 01:50:18,090
OK.

1328
01:50:24,130 --> 01:50:25,970
So anything update so far?

1329
01:50:26,689 --> 01:50:27,909
Look at the board.

1330
01:50:33,090 --> 01:50:33,569
OK.

1331
01:50:33,569 --> 01:50:37,029
So let's go talk to...

1332
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:40,420
OK.

1333
01:50:42,369 --> 01:50:42,609
All right.

1334
01:50:42,609 --> 01:50:43,250
So we did those two.

1335
01:50:43,250 --> 01:50:45,170
We got to talk to Lucius Fox and Detective Montoya.

1336
01:50:45,170 --> 01:50:51,140
So let's go talk to them both.

1337
01:50:51,140 --> 01:50:53,380
I do want to see what Batgirl's moves are.

1338
01:50:53,939 --> 01:50:55,130
I know.

1339
01:50:59,279 --> 01:51:00,560
I think my teeth are falling out.

1340
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:01,279
Oh, Jesus.

1341
01:51:08,069 --> 01:51:08,550
All right.

1342
01:51:08,550 --> 01:51:09,050
Batgirl.

1343
01:51:09,590 --> 01:51:10,390
What do you got for moves?

1344
01:51:11,479 --> 01:51:11,979
Whoa.

1345
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:13,399
What is that?

1346
01:51:20,319 --> 01:51:22,319
She's got like a baton nunchuck?

1347
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:24,689
That's her ranged.

1348
01:51:25,939 --> 01:51:26,739
Yeah, she throws.

1349
01:51:26,739 --> 01:51:27,460
She throws shit.

1350
01:51:28,100 --> 01:51:33,000
She has the batarang, right?

1351
01:51:37,159 --> 01:51:37,880
Cool.

1352
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:39,000
What about gear?

1353
01:51:41,699 --> 01:51:42,340
Different suits.

1354
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:44,180
Cool.

1355
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:45,750
I like this one.

1356
01:51:48,050 --> 01:51:48,449
OK.

1357
01:51:48,449 --> 01:51:48,949
Cool.

1358
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:51,279
OK.

1359
01:51:51,279 --> 01:51:52,479
Well, it's definitely going to be this one.

1360
01:51:53,039 --> 01:51:59,090
Tonfa.

1361
01:52:03,510 --> 01:52:04,010
Cool.

1362
01:52:05,970 --> 01:52:06,470
All right.

1363
01:52:06,930 --> 01:52:07,939
So let's do the...

1364
01:52:08,819 --> 01:52:09,859
Let's go this way.

1365
01:52:13,640 --> 01:52:14,359
Gotham Knights.

1366
01:52:15,319 --> 01:52:17,319
Available right now on PC.

1367
01:52:17,319 --> 01:52:18,279
PlayStation 5.

1368
01:52:18,279 --> 01:52:20,600
Xbox Series X, Series S.

1369
01:52:22,130 --> 01:52:22,689
It's there.

1370
01:52:22,689 --> 01:52:23,569
It came out today.

1371
01:52:24,289 --> 01:52:25,750
Why are you so narrow?

1372
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:28,920
I'll fix my webcam when we play the scary game, OK?

1373
01:52:36,069 --> 01:52:36,869
Open world.

1374
01:52:36,869 --> 01:52:38,069
Here's the whole map.

1375
01:52:38,069 --> 01:52:38,869
Co-op.

1376
01:52:38,869 --> 01:52:43,220
The whole game.

1377
01:52:43,220 --> 01:52:44,579
I'm closest to...

1378
01:52:44,579 --> 01:52:46,319
I'm close to...

1379
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:48,960
Detective Montoya will mark that.

1380
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:52,439
Let's check out...

1381
01:52:52,439 --> 01:52:53,560
Oh, I need to do points.

1382
01:52:56,260 --> 01:52:58,500
Justice, grit, or oracle.

1383
01:52:59,060 --> 01:53:04,439
Using AR mode, Batgirl can disable certain devices like cameras,

1384
01:53:04,439 --> 01:53:05,079
turrets, and mines.

1385
01:53:05,079 --> 01:53:05,880
That's pretty amazing.

1386
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:10,600
Increases Batgirl's base house by 40%.

1387
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:13,199
That seems amazing.

1388
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:16,640
Or Perfect Evade.

1389
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:17,600
I feel like I want that.

1390
01:53:19,279 --> 01:53:20,880
I always start with Perfect Evade.

1391
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:27,039
Critical damage.

1392
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:28,479
Defense.

1393
01:53:29,119 --> 01:53:31,199
What is down this tree?

1394
01:53:32,069 --> 01:53:35,909
Overcharge an enemy's gun or device instantly applying a bioelectric...

1395
01:53:35,909 --> 01:53:37,670
A bioelectric elemental effect.

1396
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:47,399
Most enemy attacks can't interrupt Batgirl's heavy melee attack.

1397
01:53:47,399 --> 01:53:49,170
That's pretty good.

1398
01:53:49,170 --> 01:53:54,260
Batgirl can revive herself once after her health is depleted.

1399
01:53:54,260 --> 01:53:55,300
OK, we're doing this tree.

1400
01:53:59,729 --> 01:54:01,170
No interruptions or...

1401
01:54:01,170 --> 01:54:02,369
This one's like defense, right?

1402
01:54:05,890 --> 01:54:10,050
Batgirl receives a 75% defense bonus when hit by an enemy counterattack.

1403
01:54:10,050 --> 01:54:11,250
We'll go with this one.

1404
01:54:11,250 --> 01:54:12,920
I can get them both.

1405
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:14,800
Yeah.

1406
01:54:16,319 --> 01:54:17,680
Self-revive will be good.

1407
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:19,279
OK.

1408
01:54:21,060 --> 01:54:21,699
All right.

1409
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:24,770
Let's go.

1410
01:54:24,770 --> 01:54:41,520
I like the cape.

1411
01:54:56,899 --> 01:54:57,220
Cape.

1412
01:54:58,500 --> 01:54:59,539
C-A-P-E.

1413
01:55:00,260 --> 01:55:02,640
The cape.

1414
01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:35,729
It's scary every time.

1415
01:55:49,939 --> 01:55:50,420
All right.

1416
01:55:50,420 --> 01:55:51,060
Here we are.

1417
01:55:51,060 --> 01:55:51,300
Hi.

1418
01:55:54,050 --> 01:55:54,529
What do you got?

1419
01:55:55,649 --> 01:55:56,529
Some kind of mission?

1420
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:00,479
Don't you sneak up on me like that.

1421
01:56:01,430 --> 01:56:02,310
I actually kind of did.

1422
01:56:03,109 --> 01:56:07,829
Not the bat I was expecting to see, but if he trusts you, so will I.

1423
01:56:09,140 --> 01:56:09,779
Likewise.

1424
01:56:10,579 --> 01:56:12,100
I assume you've got something in mind.

1425
01:56:12,659 --> 01:56:13,220
Fill me in.

1426
01:56:14,600 --> 01:56:19,159
Well, since we lost Gordon, some cops are back to playing dirty again.

1427
01:56:20,039 --> 01:56:23,720
Kane doesn't like it, but she's not doing much to stop it either.

1428
01:56:24,930 --> 01:56:25,649
So I've heard.

1429
01:56:26,289 --> 01:56:28,289
She's not half the commissioner he was.

1430
01:56:29,510 --> 01:56:31,989
I know Batman was helping Gordon clean up the force,

1431
01:56:32,630 --> 01:56:36,869
but now any cops who used to be on Gordon's team are getting their asses handed to them.

1432
01:56:37,989 --> 01:56:41,189
The gangs are ambushing them because they won't take bribes,

1433
01:56:41,189 --> 01:56:45,430
and dispatchers are giving them the worst assignments because they make trouble for everyone else.

1434
01:56:46,630 --> 01:56:49,270
Hoping the gangs will do their dirty work for them.

1435
01:56:49,270 --> 01:56:51,430
That's horrible.

1436
01:56:52,390 --> 01:56:57,760
Well, look, I hate to ask, but can you keep an eye on cops when they're facing off against the gangs?

1437
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:03,760
I know a lot of my fellow officers have issues with vigilantes, but they need the help.

1438
01:57:04,479 --> 01:57:05,199
Watch out.

1439
01:57:05,199 --> 01:57:06,319
Helping is what I do.

1440
01:57:07,119 --> 01:57:11,199
And those who actually care about Gotham will hopefully see that we're on the same side.

1441
01:57:12,319 --> 01:57:12,720
Thanks.

1442
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:17,119
I'll try to get you some resources to help you protect everyone in Gotham.

1443
01:57:17,119 --> 01:57:17,840
Not just us.

1444
01:57:19,039 --> 01:57:19,920
Sounds good to me.

1445
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:21,939
Let's go.

1446
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:24,239
Okay.

1447
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:25,840
Side activity complete.

1448
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:28,640
Contacts offer tasks to help clean up and protect Gotham City.

1449
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:31,920
Help various contacts during patrols to earn distinct rewards.

1450
01:57:35,720 --> 01:57:36,039
Okay.

1451
01:57:36,039 --> 01:57:38,199
Hey, you saved someone's life out there.

1452
01:57:39,079 --> 01:57:43,060
So now we gotta go talk to the box.

1453
01:57:43,779 --> 01:57:51,250
Oh, is that a bat memory or something?

1454
01:57:54,659 --> 01:57:57,300
Oh, I gotta, my webcam's gotta go off for this.

1455
01:57:57,300 --> 01:57:59,329
These are cutscenes.

1456
01:57:59,329 --> 01:58:37,890
The game's multiplayer?

1457
01:58:37,890 --> 01:58:38,930
It is multiplayer.

1458
01:58:38,930 --> 01:58:39,409
The whole thing.

1459
01:58:40,289 --> 01:58:41,569
The whole thing's co-op.

1460
01:58:41,569 --> 01:58:55,060
What's a gal like you doing in a place like this?

1461
01:58:56,689 --> 01:58:57,329
Same as you.

1462
01:58:58,689 --> 01:58:59,329
Wait, did we?

1463
01:58:59,329 --> 01:59:02,340
You're visiting an old friend.

1464
01:59:02,340 --> 01:59:03,380
We do?

1465
01:59:03,380 --> 01:59:09,170
I keep waiting for him to step down and, I don't know, give some inspiring speech.

1466
01:59:09,170 --> 01:59:10,449
Tell us to get back to work.

1467
01:59:11,329 --> 01:59:12,850
Maybe he didn't think I was sticking around.

1468
01:59:13,569 --> 01:59:15,239
You would have hated this.

1469
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:21,029
They put you on an actual damn pedestal.

1470
01:59:21,029 --> 01:59:22,229
Maybe he'd understand.

1471
01:59:24,420 --> 01:59:26,420
He always said people needed symbols.

1472
01:59:28,899 --> 01:59:29,859
Something to believe in.

1473
01:59:31,989 --> 01:59:34,869
Yeah, but we both know he met you bats.

1474
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:42,609
Not him, except with the squared up jawline and better glasses.

1475
01:59:43,489 --> 01:59:44,930
They changed his face?

1476
01:59:45,890 --> 01:59:50,050
Yeah, it's hard to tell from here, but it looks nothing like him.

1477
01:59:50,770 --> 01:59:56,069
Wish we had him back.

1478
01:59:57,109 --> 01:59:59,460
Yeah, me too.

1479
02:00:00,420 --> 02:00:10,850
See you later, Jim, bat girl.

1480
02:00:11,649 --> 02:00:22,979
He looks just like I remember.

1481
02:00:23,939 --> 02:00:36,710
So that, yeah, so that's a, there are the, yeah, there's like little things around the

1482
02:00:36,710 --> 02:00:38,869
city you can think, activate cutscenes and stuff.

1483
02:00:42,020 --> 02:00:42,819
Let me link this.

1484
02:00:43,380 --> 02:00:54,500
There we go.

1485
02:00:54,500 --> 02:00:59,779
Okay, so I need to go to Lucius, who is down here.

1486
02:00:59,779 --> 02:01:01,380
He's pretty far away, isn't he?

1487
02:01:03,460 --> 02:01:03,939
Kind of.

1488
02:01:09,159 --> 02:01:13,319
Am I lazy and teleport back here and then go or, no, we got a crime right here.

1489
02:01:13,319 --> 02:01:14,039
I'm gonna do this one.

1490
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:27,760
I also want to learn some moveset stuff with bat girl.

1491
02:01:28,399 --> 02:01:31,409
Yeah, we'll open up tomorrow with bat girl.

1492
02:01:38,130 --> 02:01:39,489
Well, the game, I mean.

1493
02:01:39,489 --> 02:01:41,810
We'll stream something else for the first couple of hours.

1494
02:01:44,130 --> 02:01:45,409
What is, what is happening here?

1495
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:47,840
Investigate the crime scene.

1496
02:01:54,560 --> 02:01:56,239
Oh, wait, this person is dead on ground.

1497
02:01:59,510 --> 02:02:00,069
What happened?

1498
02:02:00,630 --> 02:02:08,640
Okay, let's investigate.

1499
02:02:09,279 --> 02:02:16,850
Oh my goodness.

1500
02:02:16,850 --> 02:02:18,850
Find five clues to learn what happened.

1501
02:02:20,789 --> 02:02:22,390
Got shot in the chest.

1502
02:02:22,390 --> 02:02:31,699
Okay, holding a ring.

1503
02:02:31,699 --> 02:02:34,579
Power worker's union ring must belong to the victim.

1504
02:02:34,579 --> 02:02:36,739
The motive of this crime was likely not monetary.

1505
02:02:37,619 --> 02:02:46,720
Notebook says data and notes on power boxes.

1506
02:02:46,720 --> 02:02:51,670
Ammo type is too common to trace.

1507
02:02:51,670 --> 02:02:55,560
Positive ID on the victim of Gotham.

1508
02:02:55,560 --> 02:02:57,399
City worker reported missing in recent weeks.

1509
02:02:57,399 --> 02:03:01,640
The regulators likely tried to glean information from him about the city power grid.

1510
02:03:01,640 --> 02:03:10,069
Which clue points to the current location of the suspects?

1511
02:03:10,789 --> 02:03:15,909
Wait, what?

1512
02:03:15,909 --> 02:03:21,170
It's, we're gonna go to the power grid, right?

1513
02:03:21,729 --> 02:03:34,039
Discover what happened and where the suspects are hiding.

1514
02:03:34,600 --> 02:03:38,260
Which clue points to the current location?

1515
02:03:38,260 --> 02:03:39,060
Oh, okay, okay.

1516
02:03:39,859 --> 02:03:42,100
I get it.

1517
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:43,060
I have to select the clue.

1518
02:03:43,060 --> 02:03:44,500
So it's the power box shit.

1519
02:03:51,699 --> 02:03:54,159
And that's it, right?

1520
02:03:54,159 --> 02:03:55,119
Solve it.

1521
02:03:55,119 --> 02:03:56,420
Wait, it's not?

1522
02:03:56,420 --> 02:04:01,300
Gunpowder residue.

1523
02:04:01,859 --> 02:04:10,960
Wouldn't this say is where the location, where they are?

1524
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:11,840
The ring?

1525
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:13,810
Oh, right.

1526
02:04:14,770 --> 02:04:17,670
No, not correct.

1527
02:04:17,670 --> 02:04:28,399
Gunpowder?

1528
02:04:28,399 --> 02:04:29,439
Oh, all right.

1529
02:04:30,079 --> 02:04:35,279
Crime resolved.

1530
02:04:35,279 --> 02:04:37,840
Oh, I was gonna say that we didn't find them.

1531
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:39,199
Okay, so now where are you?

1532
02:04:39,199 --> 02:04:42,550
Over here.

1533
02:04:42,550 --> 02:04:49,829
Is that illegal hacking?

1534
02:04:49,829 --> 02:04:53,300
Criminal in hiding.

1535
02:04:53,300 --> 02:04:55,859
All right, we'll do this and then we'll go wrap around to Lucius.

1536
02:04:55,859 --> 02:04:58,239
Is the camera still fucking up?

1537
02:04:58,239 --> 02:05:02,439
Is my camera still freaking out all the time or is it not bad right now?

1538
02:05:06,449 --> 02:05:10,659
Not really.

1539
02:05:10,659 --> 02:05:12,180
Yeah, I can see your bald spot.

1540
02:05:12,180 --> 02:05:13,460
Oh, that's all right.

1541
02:05:13,460 --> 02:05:25,250
I'm gonna try to see why that's happening.

1542
02:05:25,810 --> 02:05:27,170
I'll do some troubleshooting tonight.

1543
02:05:27,890 --> 02:05:28,850
So tomorrow it doesn't happen.

1544
02:05:29,489 --> 02:05:34,130
All right, let's go track this person down.

1545
02:05:34,130 --> 02:05:41,189
I don't have a bald spot.

1546
02:05:41,189 --> 02:05:44,199
Look, I'll go like this, look.

1547
02:05:44,920 --> 02:06:22,310
All right, so who's the killer?

1548
02:06:22,869 --> 02:06:44,479
Okay, reach the hideout.

1549
02:06:44,479 --> 02:06:55,359
Oh my God, there you are.

1550
02:06:55,359 --> 02:06:56,479
All right, you're on.

1551
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:01,439
No, oh.

1552
02:07:02,239 --> 02:07:06,949
Beat two enemies at the same time.

1553
02:07:08,130 --> 02:07:09,409
Defeat with momentum abilities.

1554
02:07:10,529 --> 02:07:14,470
What's with their voices?

1555
02:07:40,529 --> 02:07:54,609
Oh, holy shit.

1556
02:07:54,609 --> 02:07:55,970
All right, that girl's pretty cool.

1557
02:08:29,600 --> 02:08:30,000
Nice.

1558
02:08:33,170 --> 02:08:35,170
They're not getting up anytime soon.

1559
02:08:35,170 --> 02:08:35,649
I did it.

1560
02:08:36,449 --> 02:08:47,439
All right, now Lucius.

1561
02:08:47,439 --> 02:08:48,239
There you are.

1562
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:51,760
Made some pretty good progress, I think.

1563
02:08:52,319 --> 02:09:00,710
Where's my car?

1564
02:09:00,710 --> 02:09:07,840
I like you can just summon the car.

1565
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:08,800
It just appears.

1566
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:09,439
It's just ready.

1567
02:09:10,079 --> 02:09:21,329
How many beers do you drink in an hour?

1568
02:09:21,329 --> 02:09:25,750
I don't know.

1569
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:26,789
We have one, who cares?

1570
02:09:40,149 --> 02:09:58,739
All right, cut scene.

1571
02:09:58,739 --> 02:10:00,739
No place like it, is there, Mr. Fox?

1572
02:10:06,340 --> 02:10:07,939
You're trying to give me another heart attack?

1573
02:10:10,369 --> 02:10:11,729
Batman taught you everything, huh?

1574
02:10:12,369 --> 02:10:13,569
Just the important things.

1575
02:10:14,289 --> 02:10:16,210
Sneaking up on your allies, for one.

1576
02:10:20,069 --> 02:10:23,510
But not how he managed to be in five places at once.

1577
02:10:24,840 --> 02:10:27,800
I feel like if I look away, everything turns to chaos.

1578
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:30,039
You got a computer up here?

1579
02:10:32,369 --> 02:10:35,699
Bad doesn't fall far from the belt from what I've seen.

1580
02:10:37,039 --> 02:10:38,159
Um, thank you.

1581
02:10:39,430 --> 02:10:40,310
Don't thank me yet.

1582
02:10:42,659 --> 02:10:45,539
This is not a secure place to be doing work up here.

1583
02:10:45,539 --> 02:10:46,659
Like, this is kind of secret work.

1584
02:10:47,380 --> 02:10:55,239
Your mentor and I always knew that something like this could happen.

1585
02:10:56,439 --> 02:11:00,529
When I left Wayne Tech, we kept some research going.

1586
02:11:00,529 --> 02:11:03,029
There are a lot of eyes on you now.

1587
02:11:04,050 --> 02:11:05,409
No one's looking at Fox Tech.

1588
02:11:05,409 --> 02:11:07,090
Brain's gonna ruin that computer.

1589
02:11:07,090 --> 02:11:08,930
As long as I got a break between the guilds,

1590
02:11:09,810 --> 02:11:12,449
you'll still have everything you need to carry on Batman's legacy.

1591
02:11:13,170 --> 02:11:15,189
Speaking of which.

1592
02:11:19,380 --> 02:11:20,020
Whoa.

1593
02:11:20,020 --> 02:11:21,779
These flowers are gorgeous.

1594
02:11:22,340 --> 02:11:23,460
It's Luke's design.

1595
02:11:24,020 --> 02:11:26,680
A custom bird to help you get around a little quicker.

1596
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:29,920
Hefty enough to support exactly one hero.

1597
02:11:32,050 --> 02:11:35,430
With this, the sky really is the limit.

1598
02:11:37,350 --> 02:11:38,310
Now you can thank me.

1599
02:11:38,949 --> 02:11:42,079
Thank you so much, Mr. Fox.

1600
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:49,520
Do I actually get to fly this?

1601
02:11:53,199 --> 02:11:56,960
Belfry, if this isn't enough to convince Penguin, nothing left.

1602
02:11:57,989 --> 02:11:59,270
Be careful.

1603
02:11:59,270 --> 02:12:00,789
Penguin's going to have an angle here.

1604
02:12:02,199 --> 02:12:02,699
Okay.

1605
02:12:04,100 --> 02:12:04,500
Reach...

1606
02:12:04,500 --> 02:12:05,779
All right, we're going back to the launch.

1607
02:12:05,779 --> 02:12:07,859
I'm dying to try this baby out.

1608
02:12:07,859 --> 02:12:08,579
How do I start?

1609
02:12:09,460 --> 02:12:11,100
You're getting ahead of yourself.

1610
02:12:11,659 --> 02:12:15,020
Before you can use the bird, you'll have to clear a path for it.

1611
02:12:15,020 --> 02:12:15,829
Clear a path?

1612
02:12:15,829 --> 02:12:16,710
Whatever I need to do.

1613
02:12:18,100 --> 02:12:21,939
Lately, the GCPD is not content to have jackboots on the ground.

1614
02:12:21,939 --> 02:12:22,979
Somebody's shooting a machine gun.

1615
02:12:22,979 --> 02:12:26,420
They launched a network of surveillance drones to patrol the skies.

1616
02:12:27,619 --> 02:12:30,420
If they're looking for you when you try to get airborne.

1617
02:12:30,420 --> 02:12:32,579
They won't hesitate to take me down.

1618
02:12:33,300 --> 02:12:34,260
What do you recommend?

1619
02:12:35,619 --> 02:12:40,260
A creative programmer could convince those drones to overlook certain targets.

1620
02:12:41,220 --> 02:12:44,659
But for that to work, close-up scans would be required.

1621
02:12:47,100 --> 02:12:50,140
For once, I'm not the one who has to handle the programming.

1622
02:12:50,779 --> 02:12:52,380
I'll get you those scans, Mr. Fox.

1623
02:12:52,380 --> 02:12:53,979
Get to solve crimes?

1624
02:12:53,979 --> 02:12:56,220
The cops have the city divided into sectors.

1625
02:12:56,779 --> 02:12:58,779
The set of drones watching over each one.

1626
02:12:59,899 --> 02:13:03,899
Until you scan all the drones in a sector, consider it a no-fly zone.

1627
02:13:04,859 --> 02:13:08,140
No flying until the surveillance drones are taken care of?

1628
02:13:08,779 --> 02:13:09,340
No problem.

1629
02:13:10,699 --> 02:13:13,739
I'll send you the location of the first one so you can get to work.

1630
02:13:15,340 --> 02:13:18,199
Okay, so we could also...

1631
02:13:18,199 --> 02:13:18,840
Let's do the...

1632
02:13:19,720 --> 02:13:20,600
I'll do that later.

1633
02:13:22,329 --> 02:13:23,130
Let's go do this.

1634
02:13:24,470 --> 02:13:28,420
Yeah, let's go take on Penguin.

1635
02:13:28,979 --> 02:13:30,020
I'm ready.

1636
02:13:30,020 --> 02:13:44,819
Only two crimes?

1637
02:13:45,880 --> 02:13:46,279
Well, I'm...

1638
02:13:46,279 --> 02:13:48,199
You'd better not be hurt this time.

1639
02:13:48,199 --> 02:13:49,000
I'm working on it.

1640
02:13:49,640 --> 02:14:01,500
Are you going to do a face reveal?

1641
02:14:02,420 --> 02:14:04,260
It's very, very soon.

1642
02:14:04,260 --> 02:14:04,899
Very soon.

1643
02:14:05,460 --> 02:14:06,659
In like five minutes.

1644
02:14:07,220 --> 02:14:10,819
Face reveal in five minutes.

1645
02:14:11,380 --> 02:14:20,810
Wait, what?

1646
02:14:23,659 --> 02:14:26,569
Uh, I've got to stop Penguin.

1647
02:14:27,210 --> 02:14:41,979
Dude, I'll be here.

1648
02:14:41,979 --> 02:14:42,220
Yep.

1649
02:14:42,859 --> 02:14:45,720
For the first time ever, you're going to see my face.

1650
02:14:46,439 --> 02:14:54,060
All right.

1651
02:14:55,960 --> 02:14:57,640
I wonder if you actually fight the Penguin.

1652
02:14:59,989 --> 02:15:01,270
I'm so curious about this.

1653
02:15:01,909 --> 02:15:23,140
Talk to the Penguin.

1654
02:15:23,140 --> 02:15:26,680
I'm here.

1655
02:15:26,680 --> 02:15:28,439
Defeat the Penguin's guards.

1656
02:15:28,439 --> 02:15:29,560
Avoid taking damage.

1657
02:15:29,560 --> 02:15:32,630
All right, well, I couldn't say anything about stealth.

1658
02:15:41,829 --> 02:15:45,590
This game really makes you feel like Batgirl.

1659
02:15:45,590 --> 02:15:51,140
Don't think so.

1660
02:15:57,560 --> 02:15:58,760
Shit, I got hurt.

1661
02:15:59,319 --> 02:16:04,279
Okay, nice.

1662
02:16:13,180 --> 02:16:14,619
She's kicking the shit out of us.

1663
02:16:17,460 --> 02:16:18,100
Oh my...

1664
02:16:21,659 --> 02:16:22,779
You can't fit in here.

1665
02:16:28,090 --> 02:16:39,459
All right, that was pretty cool.

1666
02:16:41,670 --> 02:16:42,870
All right, Batgirl is part of the...

1667
02:16:42,870 --> 02:16:44,069
Batgirl is the coolest character in the game.

1668
02:16:51,989 --> 02:16:53,110
No, please.

1669
02:16:56,069 --> 02:17:05,260
Cool, cool, cool.

1670
02:17:09,370 --> 02:17:09,610
Nice.

1671
02:17:15,260 --> 02:17:15,819
Penguin!

1672
02:17:19,579 --> 02:17:20,540
Nowhere to go anywhere.

1673
02:17:20,540 --> 02:17:21,579
Nowhere to hide, Penguin.

1674
02:17:23,260 --> 02:17:23,739
Open up.

1675
02:17:24,299 --> 02:17:27,459
I'm going to have a rocket launcher pointing at what they're doing.

1676
02:17:28,579 --> 02:17:31,180
So you can use the door after...

1677
02:17:31,180 --> 02:17:32,059
So where were we?

1678
02:17:37,209 --> 02:17:55,340
Listening.

1679
02:17:55,340 --> 02:18:00,540
You may have questions, but I can think of a few reasons not to answer them.

1680
02:18:08,729 --> 02:18:10,649
They could have probably just heard that with music.

1681
02:18:11,290 --> 02:18:15,540
Am I supposed to be acting?

1682
02:18:22,420 --> 02:18:23,379
Oh, okay.

1683
02:18:25,559 --> 02:18:27,000
There's one in the chess set.

1684
02:18:29,180 --> 02:18:30,780
Well, I'm an expert hacker, so I got this.

1685
02:18:41,700 --> 02:18:42,260
Where are the bugs?

1686
02:18:44,260 --> 02:18:44,979
Where are the bugs?

1687
02:18:48,170 --> 02:18:50,979
All right, so I'm going to pick up one of these bugs.

1688
02:18:50,979 --> 02:18:52,260
Things that's bugged.

1689
02:18:52,260 --> 02:18:52,899
I'm going to turn it.

1690
02:18:52,899 --> 02:18:56,100
I'm going to aim my mouth right where the bug is as close as I can.

1691
02:18:56,100 --> 02:18:56,579
And I'm going to go...

1692
02:18:58,549 --> 02:19:06,250
Where are they?

1693
02:19:16,579 --> 02:19:17,299
Where are the bugs?

1694
02:19:19,860 --> 02:19:20,500
Where are the bugs?

1695
02:19:21,059 --> 02:19:28,260
I need to just smash them.

1696
02:19:28,260 --> 02:19:31,399
Under the desk or something?

1697
02:19:31,959 --> 02:19:40,680
Okay.

1698
02:19:40,680 --> 02:19:41,000
How do I...

1699
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:41,559
Can I punch?

1700
02:19:50,979 --> 02:19:51,700
The face reveal?

1701
02:19:52,340 --> 02:19:54,020
Dude, don't rush it.

1702
02:19:57,579 --> 02:19:58,940
Oh, okay.

1703
02:19:58,940 --> 02:20:18,139
How do I destroy them then?

1704
02:20:18,139 --> 02:20:18,780
Plant.

1705
02:20:18,780 --> 02:20:25,700
Yeah, she's an expert hacker.

1706
02:20:25,700 --> 02:20:29,190
Two and one more.

1707
02:20:29,190 --> 02:20:36,299
I feel like I could probably do this.

1708
02:20:36,299 --> 02:20:37,180
The singing.

1709
02:20:37,180 --> 02:20:48,420
It's...

1710
02:20:49,299 --> 02:20:50,819
I'm kind of afraid that it will be...

1711
02:20:50,819 --> 02:20:55,340
It's either going to be, wow, holy shit, I can't believe you can actually do that.

1712
02:20:55,340 --> 02:20:59,940
Or that was like the cringiest thing I've ever heard in my entire life.

1713
02:20:59,940 --> 02:21:01,620
And I'm not sure which one.

1714
02:21:01,620 --> 02:21:02,579
I'm kind of afraid to do it.

1715
02:21:09,700 --> 02:21:11,139
Bring over that bottle of whiskey.

1716
02:21:12,500 --> 02:21:15,610
You want to try?

1717
02:21:20,059 --> 02:21:21,420
This is like really fucking dumb.

1718
02:21:21,979 --> 02:21:29,219
I'll try after.

1719
02:21:29,219 --> 02:21:30,579
Here's what I don't get.

1720
02:21:30,579 --> 02:21:34,579
How come you had to serve your sentence while the rest of your rich friends got a free pass?

1721
02:21:37,459 --> 02:21:38,500
They were favored.

1722
02:21:39,909 --> 02:21:40,709
I wasn't.

1723
02:21:40,709 --> 02:21:41,670
Who'd you piss off?

1724
02:21:43,979 --> 02:21:45,819
No one talks about them.

1725
02:21:45,819 --> 02:21:46,540
A lot of whiskey.

1726
02:21:46,540 --> 02:21:48,700
Not a whispered word is said.

1727
02:21:50,469 --> 02:21:52,309
The court of owls isn't real.

1728
02:21:53,190 --> 02:22:00,620
This is how you get off your chair.

1729
02:22:00,620 --> 02:22:01,100
Yes, it is.

1730
02:22:01,100 --> 02:22:02,219
The powers club.

1731
02:22:02,219 --> 02:22:02,719
Yup.

1732
02:22:03,829 --> 02:22:06,870
Where the super rich go for shits and giggles.

1733
02:22:07,590 --> 02:22:08,549
Might be worth a peek.

1734
02:22:09,430 --> 02:22:12,950
Personally, I stay far away from that raptor's nest.

1735
02:22:14,229 --> 02:22:15,670
But it's fine if I head in there.

1736
02:22:18,139 --> 02:22:21,180
I lost years of my life to Blackgate.

1737
02:22:22,700 --> 02:22:24,780
You go do what you do best.

1738
02:22:28,700 --> 02:22:30,940
Just don't tell them I sent you.

1739
02:22:30,940 --> 02:22:31,979
Is he a good guy?

1740
02:22:31,979 --> 02:22:32,780
Is he a bad guy?

1741
02:22:34,940 --> 02:22:35,579
All right, I'll try.

1742
02:22:42,979 --> 02:22:43,620
A little practice.

1743
02:22:43,620 --> 02:22:44,340
I probably hurt somebody.

1744
02:22:44,340 --> 02:22:44,840
I'm sorry.

1745
02:22:45,799 --> 02:22:46,920
Do you think he's up to something?

1746
02:22:48,059 --> 02:22:49,260
I wouldn't be surprised.

1747
02:22:49,979 --> 02:22:52,860
But he seems pretty convinced that the court of owls exists.

1748
02:22:54,139 --> 02:22:57,319
Okay, I'll do a deep dive on the court while you're out.

1749
02:22:57,319 --> 02:22:58,200
Sounds good.

1750
02:22:58,200 --> 02:22:58,700
Awful.

1751
02:23:08,299 --> 02:23:11,030
Very cool.

1752
02:23:11,030 --> 02:23:12,309
All right, let's put some points in.

1753
02:23:12,309 --> 02:23:16,200
Let's go back to the bat cave, whatever it is.

1754
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:17,239
I'll do my face reveal.

1755
02:23:17,239 --> 02:23:19,399
And then we're going to move on to another game.

1756
02:23:20,040 --> 02:23:21,770
We're going to play Deadly Night.

1757
02:23:33,989 --> 02:23:34,629
Okay.

1758
02:23:34,629 --> 02:23:35,510
Check on Alfred.

1759
02:23:37,989 --> 02:23:39,239
What's that sound?

1760
02:23:47,690 --> 02:23:48,969
Probably a mother hen?

1761
02:23:59,219 --> 02:23:59,940
What the hell?

1762
02:24:01,020 --> 02:24:01,340
All right.

1763
02:24:02,420 --> 02:24:08,180
That is going to be it for today for this game.

1764
02:24:09,620 --> 02:24:12,979
We're going to move on to Deadly Night.

1765
02:24:13,540 --> 02:24:16,149
That was Gotham Knights again.

1766
02:24:16,149 --> 02:24:17,590
The game is out now.

1767
02:24:18,780 --> 02:24:19,500
It is available.

1768
02:24:20,219 --> 02:24:28,340
You can get it right now on PS5, Xbox Series X, Series S, PC.

1769
02:24:28,340 --> 02:24:32,760
There's a link in the panel image.

1770
02:24:32,760 --> 02:24:39,510
And also we'll be playing it tomorrow.

1771
02:24:39,510 --> 02:24:41,750
Thank you, Warner Brothers again for the sponsor.

1772
02:24:41,750 --> 02:24:43,510
I know this has been like an Omega sponsor.

1773
02:24:44,229 --> 02:24:47,030
But WB has been really awesome to work with.

1774
02:24:47,030 --> 02:24:49,110
And it's been a great supporter of the channel.

1775
02:24:49,110 --> 02:24:51,190
So I'm having fun with it.

1776
02:24:51,909 --> 02:24:56,489
Like I said yesterday, I would be lying to you if I told you that

1777
02:24:56,489 --> 02:24:57,850
I was not enjoying my experience.

1778
02:25:03,030 --> 02:25:05,909
Open world games are just kind of fun to mess around in.

1779
02:25:05,909 --> 02:25:08,299
And here comes the face reveal.

1780
02:25:08,299 --> 02:25:09,100
Okay, here we go.

1781
02:25:25,430 --> 02:25:25,989
Was it all right?

1782
02:25:34,409 --> 02:25:35,930
All right, give me two minutes.

1783
02:25:35,930 --> 02:25:36,809
I'll be right back.

1784
02:25:36,809 --> 02:25:38,729
We're going to switch to Deadly Night.

1785
02:25:38,729 --> 02:25:40,090
It's a scary game.

1786
02:25:40,090 --> 02:25:41,850
It's late at night now.

1787
02:25:41,850 --> 02:25:43,290
It's going to be terrifying.

1788
02:25:43,290 --> 02:25:45,190
And I'm going to play it.

1789
02:25:45,190 --> 02:25:46,229
It is not a controller game.

1790
02:25:46,229 --> 02:25:49,750
So give me like two, three minutes to get this ready.

1791
02:25:49,750 --> 02:25:51,879
I'll be right back.

1792
02:25:55,879 --> 02:26:01,690
And again, there'll be more Gotham Knights tomorrow.

1793
02:26:01,690 --> 02:26:03,020
See you soon.

1794
02:26:03,020 --> 02:26:04,700
See you in two minutes.
