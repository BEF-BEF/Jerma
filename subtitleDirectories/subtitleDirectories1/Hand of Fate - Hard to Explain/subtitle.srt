00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:12,099
Hey, what's happening, everybody? Jerma here with a gameplay commentary on Hand of Fate,

2
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:18,179
a recently released game on Steam. And it's fun. And I kind of just want to talk about it. This is

3
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:21,859
going to be one of those videos where I just kind of talk about a game, this one in particular.

4
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:27,059
And here we go. So what is Hand of Fate? You're watching right now, you probably have no idea,

5
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:31,100
or maybe you do, because a lot of people have been starting to talk about it more recently.

6
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:38,200
It's a deck building RPG hybrid Arkham Asylum rogue-like board game.

7
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:45,560
Whoa, how dare you try to convince me that that many genres will work in a game? That is absurd

8
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,119
and disgusting and I hope you get killed. I'm out of here. I'm leaving. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

9
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:54,600
You just threw your fucking drink at me. Hold on a second. Hey, hey, hey. I'm not going to convince

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,039
me. Stop. Just listen to me for a second. Okay. What do you want? Make it quick. The reason why

11
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,799
the game is so much fun is because it is the experience you have. You make a deck and you

12
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:11,799
fight your- Oh, please tell me. That's what I thought. Good day, I'm leaving. No, no, no, no.

13
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:21,140
It's just hard to put into words why the game's fun. You're ugly. He's gone. But that's the problem

14
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:26,069
that I have with Hand of Fate. I've been sitting here trying to come up with how I'm going to

15
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:31,049
explain how this game works or what this game is for at least probably 40 minutes. I've been

16
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,969
sitting here. I don't know. How do you explain this game to somebody that doesn't know what it is?

17
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:42,099
Because at its core, it doesn't have a core. It's got so many things going on that you can't say

18
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:47,540
it's one or the other. If I tell you this is a card game, that's not true. That's not entirely

19
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,939
true because you're watching me brawl guys with an axe and bury it into their chests. This is

20
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:56,890
not a card game that you're watching right now. This is a brawler. If you were to walk in and you

21
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:01,849
had no idea what this game was and you came in at two separate intervals and you saw this

22
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:06,629
on the first time and this on the second time, you might think this is two entirely different

23
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:11,500
games. And it kind of is. On one hand, you have the deck building and on the other hand,

24
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,860
you have the combat. And as easy as I can put this, as simple as I can explain this in like

25
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,379
three sentences or less, you unlock cards by playing through the game and achieving certain

26
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:28,699
goals. You then take those cards and make a deck, which then you traverse on a game board

27
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,379
and fight your own deck and permadeath. If you lose, you have to start from the beginning of

28
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:39,419
the level again and maybe do some deck modifications. Hope that made sense.

29
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:44,680
And the confusion that sets in when you initially see somebody play this game. I saw somebody

30
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,800
stream this game a long time ago and I thought to myself, what am I even watching? What the

31
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,400
fuck is this guy doing? I don't even, I don't like this. I don't like it. I actually ended up

32
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,800
installing the game and playing for like 15 minutes before I gave up. And you can't do that

33
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:08,599
with this game. This game's tutorial is not only very easy, it's not the whole game. It's not the

34
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:13,639
point of the game. And I jumped in wanting something immediately and I got overwhelmed

35
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:19,539
with everything and had no idea what was going on. And part of me is glad that I didn't give it a

36
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:24,099
chance back when it was in early access and I didn't really start to play it till right now

37
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:29,860
because it's done now. It's released. It is 1.0. It is no longer in early access. So I get to

38
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:36,460
experience the game that was intended to be played at the initial conception of the game.

39
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,900
And besides the game, besides the gameplay, besides what I've been talking about so far,

40
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:47,400
my favorite part about this title is the fact that it was on early access and it released and

41
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,599
it's good. That alone is enough to make me happy because we've seen in the past so many early access

42
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:00,280
games that kind of just get stuck in limbo. Some of them are like abandoned almost entirely.

43
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,719
So it's refreshing to see a title like this in just over one year's development time after

44
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:13,560
being funded on Kickstarter for $55,000 by the way, which by industry standards is a handful of

45
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,560
quarters at this point in the state of the industry. But it's great to see that. It's

46
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,759
great to see it actually releasing, coming out and people enjoying it. And it's a fun game.

47
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:26,500
And I think my most enjoyment from this game comes from the choose your own adventure aspect

48
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,379
that it has in it. Because like I said, you unlock cards. When you unlock cards in this game,

49
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:37,620
you don't know what they do. You have to physically put them in your deck and run into them RNG on the

50
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:43,620
game board before you even know what they do. And some of them are very clever. You'll run into them

51
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,180
thinking you know how it's going to play out. But in fact, this vampire wanted to suck your blood

52
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,980
for money. And you have to make that decision because health is a resource. Food is a resource.

53
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:58,500
Every single time you take a step on the game board, you lose one food. And it's jumbling all

54
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:04,300
these resources and managing them or mismanaging them like I do very frequently when I play,

55
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:10,060
makes it an interesting dynamic because you kind of like to lose as much as you like to win.

56
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:16,040
My enjoyment does stem from finding these cards that I've never seen before and watching the

57
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:22,199
interesting story of the card play out in front of me. So hopefully you've gotten some type of

58
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:27,879
coherent message from this video. And the game currently right now is sitting at $20 because of

59
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:34,040
its launch sale. And I think it's going to go to 25 when it's all said and done after the wholesale

60
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,839
thing. But that's gonna wrap it up guys. Just wanted to give a little bit of a quick shout

61
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:40,040
to the game because I thought it was really fun. And that's gonna wrap it up.
