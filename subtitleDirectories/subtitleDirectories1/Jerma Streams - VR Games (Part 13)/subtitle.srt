1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:14,220
Can you hear me? All right. Good afternoon, everybody. How are you? How are you?

2
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:26,539
Oh, early. No, I am. I'm a full hour late. And one could even argue I'm two days late.

3
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:36,869
But I'm here. I am now officially fully vaccinated. So I hope I don't have any side effects in the

4
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:40,950
middle of the stream. That's kind of why I said it's going to be maybe three hours.

5
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:51,939
Because we'll see. I'm anxiously anticipating what that's going to look like.

6
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:06,459
What'd you say about my testicles? Fully vaccinated. I don't know. You said something

7
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:10,700
about like my testicles after being vaccinated. I don't know. I have no idea what you meant by that.

8
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:23,109
I didn't even read the whole thing. Remember just pretend that the vaccine is the reason you're

9
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:30,019
acting zonked. Yeah, I have a few things to talk about. Well, one in particular.

10
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:34,180
Thursday. Well, let's just wait, wait, wait, wait, we got to wait. Did I even tweet anything? I

11
00:01:34,180 --> 00:02:38,099
didn't tweet anything. Hold on. Give me a second. Let me tweet something. Be right back. So today,

12
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:42,180
this is going to be the last. This is going to be the last day of VR for a little while.

13
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:48,340
I have to put this in a box for a little bit. Some of you probably have known by the amount

14
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:56,569
of times I have taken in between these days. VR seems to royally fuck me up. Something about

15
00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:02,569
holding my arms up for more than a few hours. Even with the brace on, it just fucking annihilates

16
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:08,330
me. So we're going to put it away for a little while. I'm probably going to do more seated VR

17
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:13,050
in the future. I'm not going to do seated VR today because the whole goddamn living room has

18
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:19,289
been cleared. And like this would have been a waste of time if I didn't utilize the living

19
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:27,240
room space. And I mean, I'll be fine. I got my brace on. I'll be all right. But let's talk about

20
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:35,509
some announcements. This Thursday, so in a couple days, Ludwig and I are going to be hosting a

21
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:41,750
battleship tournament, which we will be participating in as well. I'm not going to make any bets.

22
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:46,539
If I lose, I'm just going to fucking walk away and lose. We're not adding anything. I'm not doing

23
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:52,860
anything. No, if I'm out, I'm just out of the tournament. That's it. So that's going to be on

24
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,340
Ludwig's channel. I'll be hosting him and I'll be part of the commentator team.

25
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:04,379
And then this weekend on Sunday, you don't want to miss that one. I just want to let you know ahead

26
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:15,770
of time. I'm going to be making a very, very large announcement on Sunday. So if there's a stream

27
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:21,129
that you might want to participate in, at least for a little while, is the announcement of the

28
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:32,199
announcement stream. Here it is. That's on the 1st. It's not Catboy. Nope. Oh no, it is not Catboy.

29
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:43,079
Just wait until you fucking know what that is. It's not Catboy. No, it's not. Trust me. This is

30
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:50,089
something. Whatever. I'll see you on Sunday. We'll be back actually sitting down at the chair.

31
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:59,189
Regular setup. But I think we can go here. I don't need to delay anymore. I've already

32
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:04,490
delayed enough. In the event that I start to get like a massive headache or something from this

33
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:11,050
vaccine, I'm just going to run away. I'm going to be like, guys, bye. And I'm going to immediately

34
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,850
lie down. I'm going to do like the Undertaker in my bed. I'm just going to lie down and just stay

35
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:49,769
straight. Let's turn the camera on. What do you say? This is Medal of Honor Andy.

36
00:05:53,259 --> 00:06:05,509
What? The name of the game is Medal of Honor Andy. I hope you guys are ready. They may as well.

37
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:13,750
Honest to God, seriously, at this point, like you may, what am I connected to here? Medal of

38
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:23,139
Honor Andy is the name of this game, I guess. All right. Can you guys hear it? Is a good sound for

39
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:28,819
you? Does it sound good? Because I'm ready to go. This is the, this is the one I remember like E3,

40
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,899
maybe two E3s ago or last E3 from last year. I remember seeing this game being announced and

41
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:41,189
I was like, holy shit, I can't wait to play this. So I'm actually pretty excited to play this game.

42
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:51,480
Should I be excited? This game sucks, by the way. Glad that's the first thing that I read.

43
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:59,540
All right, let's go. Here we go. Medal of Honor Andy. Am I in the right place? Why is it? I haven't

44
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:08,180
turned around that many times, have I? Oh my God, that just scared the shit out of me.

45
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:21,000
I feel pretty good. Do you not know what this is? This is universal for I'm doing just fine.

46
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:38,699
Okay. Am I supposed to be sitting down? Oh shit. Grab the pistol and shoot. Who, you?

47
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:56,139
I feel great, captain.

48
00:07:58,939 --> 00:07:59,420
Watch out.

49
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,439
Is that Harry Potter? Grab the pistol and shoot. Look out. There's a bad guy.

50
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:28,009
It's gonna, it's gonna take me like a half an hour to get out of this fucking tutorial.

51
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:40,860
All right, I promise I won't do it again. I'm not going to do it again. Why can you do that?

52
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:07,990
Um, got him. I'm putting it down. Why can you do that? What? Where did that guy even come from?

53
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:14,230
Was that guy flying? That guy was in like a, one of those squirrel suits. Get that. I don't, don't,

54
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:32,409
hey, he's like pointing at my head. He was up. No, where was he? I love how my head is just in here.

55
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:44,299
All the way. I gotta do. Good morning, Lieutenant. Welcome back to the land. You've been through a

56
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:50,700
lot. So I'll keep it brief. I'm with the office of strategic services. Our mission is subversion

57
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,139
and everything in between. How's the audio? Can you hear it? We're taking the fight to the Nazis.

58
00:09:54,779 --> 00:10:05,049
Can't hear it. There you go. We do some of the most dangerous work of the war. We're looking

59
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:09,289
for people just like you. Can I have that hat? Now the sergeant and I go way back.

60
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:15,639
They're like all around me. It's weird. What you did in Tunisia. He's nominated you for the

61
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:23,850
medal of honor. Trust me, Lieutenant. I hate doing paperwork, but in your case, I'm in an exception.

62
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:31,110
You saved our lives. You're welcome. Thank you. You guys did good too. Life is usually a pageant of

63
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:36,149
idiots and fools, but occasionally you find yourself in the company of good people

64
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:43,059
and then anything is possible. Lieutenant, you are now going to hear the most important question

65
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:50,820
I can ask. Would you like to join the OSS? Give a thumbs up or thumbs down to proceed. What would

66
00:10:50,820 --> 00:11:01,929
I like to? Should I join thumbs down? I don't think so. Not today. I understand, Lieutenant.

67
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:05,370
As soon as you're back on your feet, we'll have you on a transport for New York.

68
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:14,419
Game over. Wait, is that it? Did I speed run losing the game?

69
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:39,830
That's the end of the game. Are you kidding me? What do I do now? What is this?

70
00:11:40,789 --> 00:11:52,980
Gallery? Introduction to the gallery. What is going on? How do I? Go back 10 seconds. How do I?

71
00:11:52,980 --> 00:12:09,059
What do I do? Can I go over there? Main menu. What happened? Missions. Stay alive. Okay,

72
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:22,659
this is where we go. Right here. Welcome to the OSS. I want to join it. Okay, here we go. Yes,

73
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:28,789
I would like to join. I'm joining the OSS. Thank you. Why is there a gun here?

74
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:38,120
Lieutenant, I'm Dr. Thatch. Welcome to the infirmary. We'll have you back on your feet

75
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,360
in no time. Come on, blink again. I know you're having some trouble speaking after what happened.

76
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,480
No, blink again. I want to change my- Let's just use hand gestures, eh?

77
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,549
Whatever. Welcome to the infirmary. You can set your game options in this interactive mode. You

78
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:55,240
can also do it anytime. Okay, whatever. Interactive exam? Sure. How delightful.

79
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:01,690
Going to ask you a series of questions. And don't worry, you can change your answers at any time.

80
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:08,649
Now, my first question is an easy one, Lieutenant. Are you left or right-handed? Please,

81
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:14,740
make your choice. I am right-handed. Ah, fantastic. Use the gun. I can't.

82
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:19,379
Let's confirm your fine motor skills. Please, pick up the service weapon next to you.

83
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:25,940
No. No. No. No. No. Yes.

84
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,879
Splendid. Now, give me a thumbs up if you're ready to continue,

85
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:32,440
or a thumbs down if you want to change your selection.

86
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:38,149
No, that's fine. I like that. Well done, Lieutenant. On to the next question.

87
00:13:39,429 --> 00:13:41,909
We put blanks in your gun because you're a psycho.

88
00:13:41,909 --> 00:13:48,629
Combat zone. Whenever you're in close proximity to an explosion, you might feel a concussive blast.

89
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:52,070
The technicians call it camera shake. Turn that off immediately.

90
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:55,429
You can also feel this camera shake phenomenon when firing your weapon.

91
00:13:56,309 --> 00:14:01,190
But through the wonders of modern medicine, I can easily adjust how much camera shake you feel.

92
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,269
I want zero. Let me know your preference.

93
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:10,379
Zero. None. The worst thing to put in any game. Why don't you test fire your weapon?

94
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:16,470
Yeah, why would you want camera shake? Now, if you're happy with your choice,

95
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:21,269
please give me a thumbs up. If you'd like to choose again, give me a thumbs down.

96
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:24,549
This game lets you kill the soldiers in the prologue, but not the doctor.

97
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,850
Jolly good, Lieutenant. On to the next question.

98
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:37,830
I was very jarring that you could do that. Now, let's discuss how you want to view an enemy's

99
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:45,820
threat level. See the two imaginary enemies in front of you?

100
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:49,179
Note how their threat level is indicated above their head.

101
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:52,779
Their threat levels? The stars they have, the bigger the threat.

102
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,700
An enemy with one star should be easy for you to dispatch.

103
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,179
Is this like World of Warcraft zones?

104
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:06,120
Seeing an enemy's threat level from a distance gives you the chance to adjust your tactics.

105
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,360
I have a question. If I shoot him in the head, it still kills him, right?

106
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,809
Some of the technicians in the back say this affects immersion.

107
00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:14,730
I just burped and I hope you all heard it, but I don't.

108
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,330
It never floats your boat, I say.

109
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:20,730
Lieutenant, please choose if you'd like to see the enemy threat level.

110
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,679
What do you think? No? I don't think so, right?

111
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,360
I'm skipping the checkup. Get me out of here.

112
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:31,000
I am always here, Lieutenant, so please come back anytime.

113
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,559
You can access my office through the main menu. Good luck and Tally-ho.

114
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:42,899
Tally-ho. Firing Ranger.

115
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:43,940
All right, this one we're going to learn how to play.

116
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,299
Remember, every VR game wants you to see how cool they have their reload feature.

117
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:58,889
Now that you're back, we should give you an objective as well.

118
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:00,250
Oh my god, that was cool.

119
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,179
All right, right sleeve is current objective. Follow the tutorial prompts.

120
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:16,870
Okay. Cool.

121
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:22,899
That feels pretty good.

122
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:42,470
I like that a lot. Okay.

123
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,129
Controls are pretty good. I'm going to give it that.

124
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,009
The controls are pretty good.

125
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:51,259
He hates the game that in any game that's not Alex.

126
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,299
That's not true, but it is a little bit.

127
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,289
I have basic training down here.

128
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:13,059
Oh, cool. What do we got?

129
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,980
Why are you so much bigger than me?

130
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:30,019
Press this button.

131
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,480
Oh, okay. That's pretty fun.

132
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:47,220
I'm not going to shoot him. All right.

133
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,829
Oh, sick.

134
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:59,420
Oh, this actually I like this.

135
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:06,950
All right, reach over the shoulder and grab.

136
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:14,410
Oh, fuck. Okay.

137
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:18,119
Grab the SMG. This is not an SMG.

138
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:21,029
How do I get my SMG?

139
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,230
Oh, there we go.

140
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:30,859
You had to do it with two hands.

141
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:41,210
Okay. Let me help you.

142
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:49,640
We shouldn't be standing this close.

143
00:18:49,640 --> 00:19:05,380
Okay. Okay. Put this in.

144
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:15,579
You shouldn't be this close to your ears would be bleeding right now.

145
00:19:15,579 --> 00:19:21,960
How are your ears not bleeding?

146
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,180
What? Don't. All right. I'm fine.

147
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,859
All right. Next station over here.

148
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:43,980
I've got to be fair.

149
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:47,589
I've got to be fair.

150
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:52,900
Probably out of all the games I've played in VR so far,

151
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,900
all of them that includes Alex.

152
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,890
It's it's this is this works.

153
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:03,299
This this this works. It works.

154
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:04,500
It works just fine.

155
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,730
And I don't I have no problem with it.

156
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:07,529
It works.

157
00:20:07,529 --> 00:20:18,150
The box. Here we go.

158
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:36,839
How do you do it?

159
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,619
Okay. How do you reload it though?

160
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:45,980
So I can get mad at chat for getting mad at me two days ago.

161
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,509
How do you do it?

162
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:52,069
Okay. So I people have people are fucking furious

163
00:20:52,069 --> 00:20:53,269
because I was using my left hand.

164
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:53,750
Let me see.

165
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,369
No, it doesn't work like that.

166
00:20:57,369 --> 00:20:57,769
Hold on.

167
00:21:01,849 --> 00:21:17,079
Okay. I like them both.

168
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:24,740
You can have this med kit.

169
00:21:47,109 --> 00:21:48,869
Simulate a grave injury.

170
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:56,519
Sorry, I didn't press the button fast enough to make you get hurt.

171
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:08,779
The syringe will inject the medicine.

172
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:11,579
You can store up to three first aid syringes.

173
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:12,539
Where?

174
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,019
My cuff.

175
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:18,410
Ooh, I like that.

176
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:21,190
I you got to give him credit where credit is due.

177
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,359
You have to.

178
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:23,160
I'm giving him credit.

179
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,380
Everyone said this game sucks.

180
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:31,019
So far, this is very fluid, easy to grab shit.

181
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:32,869
Nothing fucking freaks out.

182
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:33,910
I like it.

183
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,900
I might change my mind in like 10 minutes.

184
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,779
This is very important.

185
00:22:38,779 --> 00:22:39,579
How cool the grenades.

186
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:45,140
What?

187
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,950
What?

188
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:53,299
I'm hope.

189
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:56,920
I thought if I hold the thing down, it doesn't.

190
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,880
Oh, a shtylen.

191
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,400
A shtylen.

192
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:01,589
Does it count down?

193
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:04,569
Why was it not counting down?

194
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,970
Did you see it was counting down before?

195
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,250
It was like three, two.

196
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,130
Oh, okay.

197
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,299
What about the shtylen?

198
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:29,500
You can.

199
00:23:40,069 --> 00:23:45,109
Oh, are we all right?

200
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:46,869
It stuck on me.

201
00:23:46,869 --> 00:23:47,670
Get it off me.

202
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:48,309
Get it off me.

203
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:48,869
Get it off me.

204
00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:49,910
It's stuck on me.

205
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:50,869
Oh, no, it's all right.

206
00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:51,430
Is it open?

207
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:51,910
No, it is.

208
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:55,480
All right, we're fine.

209
00:23:58,259 --> 00:23:58,980
Practice range.

210
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:07,380
Cat puke.

211
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,940
Where am I going?

212
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:18,890
This way?

213
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:19,289
All right.

214
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:29,849
Are these people?

215
00:24:29,849 --> 00:24:31,130
Wait, why are there people here?

216
00:24:31,849 --> 00:24:34,900
Why do we have these guys like just walking around?

217
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,410
Why do we have humans?

218
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:52,140
A guy in the back.

219
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,700
Check this out.

220
00:24:53,579 --> 00:25:10,279
I want another grenade.

221
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:10,519
Full.

222
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:20,579
There we go.

223
00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:25,109
You got to do it like sidearm.

224
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:25,509
Yes.

225
00:25:25,509 --> 00:25:26,309
All right, that's fun.

226
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:26,809
Cool.

227
00:25:34,829 --> 00:25:41,470
I'm really healthy now.

228
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:41,970
Hypers.

229
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,349
What is hypers?

230
00:25:44,349 --> 00:25:50,599
Oh, I'm like, where am I?

231
00:25:50,599 --> 00:26:00,940
It's Ali, right?

232
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,440
Yes, sir.

233
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,039
I'm 23.

234
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,180
23?

235
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,420
Oh, sht.

236
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:17,400
I'm out of the car.

237
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:20,519
Oh, sht.

238
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:21,160
I fucked it up.

239
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,440
I want to do this for sure.

240
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,700
The Nazis didn't bomb Abilene, Texas.

241
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,819
They bombed London, England.

242
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:29,000
They destroyed my home.

243
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,079
They burned my entire life to the ground.

244
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:33,640
And now I want to do the same thing to the Third Reich.

245
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,750
Way to get to the front.

246
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,619
How do you think I got to Tunisia?

247
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:44,730
Forging transfer orders has become a hobby of mine.

248
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,079
Make it to France.

249
00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:50,730
No, you're finally awake.

250
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:51,450
Harry Potter.

251
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,170
That's what I said.

252
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,049
Don't worry, Ali.

253
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:54,329
Your secret's safe.

254
00:26:54,329 --> 00:26:54,829
What does it say?

255
00:26:54,829 --> 00:26:56,809
I'm pretty sure the lieutenant isn't going to say anything.

256
00:26:57,529 --> 00:26:59,420
Thank you, Sarge.

257
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:07,049
Get down and do exactly what I say.

258
00:27:07,849 --> 00:27:10,009
I need the next part of the game to load in the right spot.

259
00:27:10,009 --> 00:27:11,289
So I'm going to go this way.

260
00:27:11,289 --> 00:27:24,269
OK, I don't care.

261
00:27:24,829 --> 00:27:36,910
I'm trying.

262
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:40,269
The game needs to load correctly when this cutscene's over.

263
00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:41,130
See?

264
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:41,609
You know what I mean?

265
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:48,349
I have to be standing in the right spot.

266
00:27:48,349 --> 00:27:48,849
All right.

267
00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:51,019
I'm training and tests.

268
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:56,380
It's time to go after the Nazis.

269
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,180
Yes, sir.

270
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:57,900
His shoulders.

271
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,180
Your first mission is to make contact with the enemy.

272
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,259
I just gave that guy like a spine problem.

273
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:04,859
The cell led by Mendeleev has been destroyed.

274
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:05,660
Wait, you mean this thing?

275
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:10,890
Your rendezvous will be along the lines of the St. Catherine legion.

276
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:16,000
The resistance will give you a signal when it's safe to come ashore.

277
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,160
You'll have three days to assist the resistance,

278
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,279
the intelligence and German activity,

279
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:22,119
and sabotage targets of opportunity.

280
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,539
I'm talking about a small communications relay or a fuel truck.

281
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:27,500
I feel like one of the Muppets.

282
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,059
But it has like the real human hands.

283
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:30,460
You know what I mean?

284
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,140
They're always kind of like moving their fingers and stuff.

285
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:34,380
It's like the Swedish chef.

286
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,940
Now I want to introduce you to Huxley, our quartermaster.

287
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,420
Where is he?

288
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,779
She'll get you set up with what you need.

289
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:40,700
That's Huxley over there?

290
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,900
Oh, excellent.

291
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,460
Good to know.

292
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,380
Three days in and out.

293
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,500
Keep it simple.

294
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,180
I'll see you on the other side.

295
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:47,680
Got it.

296
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:52,490
Turn up the game audio?

297
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:52,730
Really?

298
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,289
It's still low.

299
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:57,450
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

300
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:58,250
wait, wait, wait, wait.

301
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,039
There you go.

302
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:02,839
Now you're going to be good.

303
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,019
Now you're going to be good.

304
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:08,730
Hello.

305
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:11,130
I'm Huxley, your quartermaster.

306
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:11,630
No.

307
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:16,329
I did this.

308
00:29:16,329 --> 00:29:17,849
We just did it.

309
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:22,730
Why is every VR game a fucking tutorial for an hour?

310
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,250
You just showed this to me.

311
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:26,890

365
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:28,179
damage what happened he travels with an entourage of well-trained troops so we

366
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:34,539
got dynamite hey put that down we set the trap wait he can do that I can do

367
00:41:34,539 --> 00:41:44,840
that too some spigot guns in strategic spots and our people positioned along

368
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:51,019
the road we have to be yeah so they brought along a one-to-one full model

369
00:41:51,019 --> 00:41:57,670
this whole mission but why do they bring it here return it let's put the plan

370
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:02,550
together that's me where do you want the dynamite I would like the dynamite to be

371
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:33,889
hmm hmm I would like the dynamite to be I'm gonna go ahead and say right I would

372
00:42:33,889 --> 00:42:40,530
like the dynamite to be right oh here excellent choice catch them right when

373
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:49,480
they come out right Bill Marcel and now our people shaky hands where should we

374
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:54,820
be placed well I think to be a little bit we get the most out of this explosion

375
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:58,179
I think Ollie should be probably somewhere in this vicinity right here

376
00:42:58,179 --> 00:43:03,789
you know what I mean right right over there Ollie I think you should be right

377
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:08,070
next to the explosives I think that's a perfect view of the the convoy coming

378
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:14,420
out of there yeah it's coming out of there I'll back you up Juliet a perfect

379
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:18,420
example we also need you to be able to pack up Ollie so if Ollie's gonna be

380
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:23,630
there I need you here right next to that yep if you go over there perfect and

381
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:28,159
Sarge you're gonna need to back up Juliet because she's gonna be focusing

382
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:31,920
on backing up Ollie I would assume you'd have to be probably right over here

383
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:52,099
right up next to that we get that good to go and you I can see everything no

572
01:30:46,829 --> 01:30:50,029
based in historical law and punishment from 16th century Europe as such it is

573
01:30:50,029 --> 01:30:56,229

this cuz I just took his head off by doing this not only do you undermine my

618
01:37:46,750 --> 01:37:56,670
authority he's alive and giving the poor sinner a chance to make the peace before

619
01:37:57,270 --> 01:38:06,510
we show that not only are we in control but that we are there and just this job

620
01:38:06,510 --> 01:38:10,510
is not simply the chopping of heads

621
01:38:10,510 --> 01:38:31,449
designed to send a message keep him down I killed him I killed him that's

622
01:38:31,449 --> 01:38:37,880
impossible how many times I have to kill him that's what you to wipe the blade I

623
01:38:41,229 --> 01:38:56,520
can't even this is cool kill him first you just go up and just slice his head

624
01:38:56,520 --> 01:39:37,689
immediately just run over there and do it holding the sword the wrong way

625
01:39:37,689 --> 01:39:43,770
citizens of Ulrich Sharpen we gather today to witness the execution of this

626
01:39:43,770 --> 01:39:50,850
poor sinner the title of executioner is a sacred charge and unnecessary I so

627
01:39:50,850 --> 01:39:55,489
badly I wish I did one of the most regrets I've had in my whole life just

628
01:39:55,489 --> 01:40:00,250
laughing over here and not seeing his head fall off behind the desk right like

629
01:40:00,250 --> 01:40:03,729
wish I could rewind it and do it again

630
01:40:03,729 --> 01:40:11,609
loyalty and in gratitude let this be an example to all those who might harbor
