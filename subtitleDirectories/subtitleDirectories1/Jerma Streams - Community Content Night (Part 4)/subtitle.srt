1
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:17,940
Relax. What? No, I don't want you to see, like, I don't want you to see my, like, pores. Yeah, I know, I know.

2
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:47,939
Screen cam, screen cam, he's gonna sit. I'm a per- I'm a human being, okay? I'm just a fucking emote. How did I even do this?

3
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,299
Let's get it stretched out.

4
00:00:51,780 --> 00:01:02,409
Is it still stre- it is a little stretched out.

5
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:14,019
Right there, right?

6
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:15,540
Right there? That-

7
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:23,659
That works. Okay. Look like fucking Adam Driver. Yeah, well, he's a handsome guy, so we do that guy give a shit.

8
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,950
That's like a handsome- that's a handsome guy.

9
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:37,180
All right. Uh, this is community- I gotta change. Hold on, get off. I don't want to be on camera. I'm never going on camera again.

10
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,980
Let me change the, uh, title.

11
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,459
To...

12
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:49,319
Uh, this is not gonna take that long because it's a lot less than it was last time. We're just catching up to...

13
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,040
This is as of...

14
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:55,959
Of last week? So as of, like, this past week.

15
00:01:58,069 --> 00:02:00,230
So from, like, the 18th or something.

16
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:03,189
Or, like, the 19th, whatever it was.

17
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:08,219
Just for us to catch up on all the stuff that we missed. Adam Driver is ugly.

18
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:19,539
Okay, and- and- oh, and- and- and- and- and now you're gonna tell me- and- and Brad Pitt is fucking ugly, too, apparently, huh?

19
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:28,120
You know, I can- I could have an opinion about somebody's that I- that- that's completely an unpopular opinion.

20
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:33,960
Except I actually- I do think that Brad Pitt is very handsome.

21
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:41,500
Uh, community.

22
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,099
Content.

23
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:47,900
Uh, snippets. Because this is not gonna be as long. Community content snippets.

24
00:02:48,539 --> 00:03:01,449
It's a bad name. Community content snacks.

25
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:04,169
Oh, that doesn't make any sense.

26
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:09,400
Community con- just community content. Nah, you- whatever. Who cares?

27
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,060
That's what we're doing.

28
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:20,330
So as you see, we're- we're on the art section.

29
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,310
Art. There is a ton of art.

30
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:33,270
Art is actually one of the things that is the most, uh, submitted.

31
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:41,020
That's why we- we have so many- we have so many talented artists here that put up a ton of awesome shit.

32
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,379
But there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of art submissions.

33
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:47,509
There's a lot.

34
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:49,509
You guys- you guys do

35
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:52,139
a lot of this shit, and it's great.

36
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:53,419
I'm back.

37
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:55,500
All right, we got a giant rat.

38
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Uh, no watermark though, but I don't know whoever it was. I'm too big. I gotta- cause I'm like, huge.

39
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:08,069
Put on some music?

40
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:15,699
Yeah, what we got? Uh, we have Skype hang up sound. That's not really good OST. Skype OST.

41
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:23,300
Oh, yeah, let's take a break. Right. We didn't- we can take a pee break. Right. That's probably gonna-

42
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,300
Yeah, I have to go to the bathroom. You're right.

43
00:04:25,860 --> 00:07:05,079
I'll get some songs. We'll go take a piss break. Be right back. Hi guys.

44
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,300
All right, what about- what should we do for music?

45
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:14,779
How about

46
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:19,750
something chill?

47
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,750
Not doom, not doom, not doom.

48
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,550
Do I like okra? A vegetable?

49
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:27,269
The fried okra is awesome. Yeah.

50
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:33,959
Odd question, but yeah.

51
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,959
Uh, Animal Crossing. Yeah, that's a good-

52
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:41,259
Which one though?

53
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:44,459
Three hours of relaxing and beautiful Animal Crossing music.

54
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:59,610
When's a new one coming out? Isn't there one coming up with Switch? Eventually? March? Holy shit, really?

55
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:04,779
All right, let's do some artwork.

56
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,459
So we have- it's a giant rat we saw for a little bit.

57
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:11,019
Thank you, whoever this was.

58
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:13,300
Good shit.

59
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,060
We have, uh,

60
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,819
me as the king.

61
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:21,620
LOL boomer king.

62
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,569
Thanks for the watermark. This is really well done.

63
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,209
Hey, we both rule. We both rule together.

64
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:34,039
It's important.

65
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,080
Boomer king. What's boomer king? I don't get it.

66
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:47,830
Me. Yeah, but I don't get it. What is a boomer king? Am I the king of all old people? I don't understand.

67
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:54,919
That's a restaurant.

68
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,360
Oh, okay. I get it.

69
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,759
I mean, I- I still don't. I'm 34.

70
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,700
I still am trying to catch on to that.

71
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:09,980
If you don't get it, then that means you're a boomer. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, this is awesome. Thank you.

72
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,620
Good shit.

73
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,980
This one's wild.

74
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,980
This one is fireman here.

75
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,500
I like this down here.

76
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,700
Hey!

77
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:30,570
My- my- one of my seven shirts I wear.

78
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:40,149
Cute little fireman in the middle. You're gonna be flashed.

79
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:46,820
Not in that way that you're thinking.

80
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,600
You got the teeth right.

81
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,370
Got the teeth right.

82
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,960
I love it.

83
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,960
SCP-985.

84
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,200
Very- very toothy. He's a very toothy guy.

85
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,950
Rat down here, too. That's cool.

86
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:11,379
Is there a watermark that I'm missing? Ooh, this is fucking high fidelity.

87
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,269
Oh, right here. There it is. Good shit.

88
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:20,970
This one's really cute. Yeah.

89
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,440
It is.

90
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,440
This one on the other hand, uh,

91
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:31,259
referencing jump king.

92
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:41,240
But I don't- I'm never gonna get this shit. I'm never gonna understand what this is.

93
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:50,100
This is horrible.

94
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,460
Fuck the king FTK. That's coming back fairly soon, by the way.

95
00:10:55,049 --> 00:10:57,049
We have some new rules implemented.

96
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:00,009
And the new FTK server

97
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:02,330
is gonna be-

98
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:09,539
Uh, it's not ready yet, but we took all that data from the last mess of a stream with the thousands of people connecting.

99
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,179
And we got it down for real.

100
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:14,419
Uh, there's gonna be a lot of fun stuff to do on that server.

101
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:17,480
Soon.

102
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,610
Soon, soon, soon.

103
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,450
Fuck the king.

104
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:25,610
Uh, this is a pretty good, uh, and this is a pretty good depiction of what happened on that stream.

105
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:32,500
Uh, chat was just freaking the fuck out because nobody could do anything and nobody could eat and I was just killing people.

106
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:36,360
Um, surrounded by

107
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
mods and devs that can fly around.

108
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:42,860
So yeah, I-

109
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,139
We took the criticism. Don't worry. We're implementing a lot of changes.

110
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,179
That's a Spongebob movie?

111
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:57,509
This is great. FTK will be coming back soon.

112
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,289
Soon, soon, soon.

113
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:03,289
Oh, right. We have, um,

114
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:05,529
we have these uh, the new

115
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:10,649
Soul Calibur VI created characters. Let's actually get close to this.

116
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:24,919
I can just do that. So these are new Soul Calibur characters.

117
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:30,139
Here's, uh, by the resident Soul Calibur VI character creator.

118
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,960
Dick Dastardly Richard. This is good. Uh, here's Bugleberry.

119
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:40,659
Everybody's favorite character.

120
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,230
Some of these are really fucking good, by the way.

121
00:12:44,789 --> 00:12:46,789
Look at this one. This is the J.

122
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:52,950
The J. Janitor. I don't even know how you do this.

123
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,100
It's perfect, though.

124
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:05,340
Here's, uh, Dr. Schmeichsen. A good doctor.

125
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,110
Is this music not loud enough?

126
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:14,620
You guys know? Oh, there you go. It's Ivy.

127
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,629
Look at this one. This is a Jupiter.

128
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,580
This one's scary because

129
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:29,580
it's just, it's the same idea with making characters in the wrestling games.

130
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:36,570
You just have to make this gigantic torso human and it's scary.

131
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:41,190
Uh, here's King Germa from the FTK stream.

132
00:13:41,909 --> 00:13:49,129
Pretty accurate. I don't know who any of these fighters are, but still.

133
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:51,779
Uh, here's the Joker.

134
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:58,409
Or the, the Germa Joker. Everybody always makes me the Joker. I don't get it.

135
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:00,409
I told you I'm more of a Riddler than I am Joker.

136
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,519
Make me as the Riddler and stuff. That's like what I want. That's what I like.

137
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,620
Oh, there's Grill Master. Why is he huge?

138
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:17,059
Why is he like seven feet tall? He's stacked. Does it? That's not accurate.

139
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:25,139
There's the Grady Grinner. He's got those barbecue shoes on.

140
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:28,840
Huge Santa.

141
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:40,259
Germario? What is, who's, what is Germario?

142
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:41,860
Just me, but Mario.

143
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,240
Dr. Germario? Why, what?

144
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,480
Oh, it's the mustache hair. Okay, I get it.

145
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,740
I didn't know what this was until right now.

146
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,929
This character is, wait, what?

147
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,990
The subsound from the Hearthstone card.

148
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:14,230
Holy shit, that's, that's a reference.

149
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,139
It's Monk, Monka S.

150
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,220
Oh, here's the wine guy.

151
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:35,190
Here is the Trine Wizard. Trine Wizard?

152
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,419
He killed my, what is this?

153
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:45,580
Character name, he killed my what?

154
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,860
He killed my mom.

155
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,389
My father was fairly well. Oh, that, right.

156
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:56,149
Here's Parappa the Rapper.

157
00:15:58,409 --> 00:15:59,289
This one's awesome.

158
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,419
You gotta take this in and like fight with Parappa.

159
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:06,139
People would be so like impressed by this one.

160
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,529
Here's Gino.

161
00:16:15,429 --> 00:16:16,230
How the fuck?

162
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,070
Oh, in the name of God.

163
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,259
Look, he's in Soul Calibur.

164
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:22,779
Look, he finally got to do something.

165
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:28,809
Instead of collect dust in a box at Square Enix.

166
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,340
Frank West.

167
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,889
Holy shit, here's the dentist.

168
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,909
Here's the Outer Worlds dentist.

169
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:47,940
That's so, it's surprising every time we get a batch of these

170
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,889
because I would, I wish you could have like 10 people

171
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:54,409
fight at the same time in Soul Calibur.

172
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:56,330
We would just do one of Rumble there somehow.

173
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:57,929
But you can't.

174
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:00,570
Here's the Jump King.

175
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:03,750
These are, this is awesome. Perfect.

176
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:07,460
And he's got the boots, he's got the boots on.

177
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,839
Soul Calibur Rumble.

178
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,140
Character name, Brian Johnson.

179
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:24,900
Is that, that's the ace, the lead singer from ACDC.

180
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:39,589
And here's me, Gnarly62.

181
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,430
Hope you enjoyed the third batch.

182
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,710
This may be the final batch

183
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,190
because a hundred character slots is not enough, I guess.

184
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:46,950
This community's wonderful.

185
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,390
They cook up some seriously amazing stuff.

186
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,470
Have a great community content night.

187
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,250
Thank you, Gnarly.

188
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,640
Again, you, you make some great characters.

189
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,500
These are great.

190
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,180
Even if we don't get another one,

191
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,420
you've done three batches of very, very accurate,

192
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,700
detailed character stuff.

193
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,579
So thank you.

194
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:07,019
You're awesome.

195
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:14,859
I'll get this back to normal.

196
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:18,059
Scary, pretty scary stuff.

197
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:26,940
Germagreed, Money Machine Germa, yep.

198
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,220
Looking good.

199
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:31,940
The duality of, of Germa, maybe.

200
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,140
Greed changes a man.

201
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:41,000
This one is the Blockbuster 1995 store champion.

202
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,400
That's me.

203
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,400
I actually own that.

204
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,160
I've shown it on stream before.

205
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,289
That is a legitimate document.

206
00:18:51,849 --> 00:19:01,029
Is the ornaments on the tree for, for Grill Master?

207
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,029
There's Grandpa appearing in.

208
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:08,680
That's a, that's a very, that's one of those videos

209
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,960
that's on my main channel from like almost a decade ago now.

210
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:14,680
I don't think very many of you guys have watched.

211
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:18,650
There's a full Grandpa poetry animation

212
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,569
on that main channel for Christmas.

213
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,940
I think, I think a lot of people may have missed that one.

214
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,609
Main channel.

215
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:32,259
Archive channel.

216
00:19:32,259 --> 00:19:33,220
There you go.

217
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:33,859
I fixed it.

218
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,339
This is good stuff though.

219
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:37,619
Down here.

220
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,779
You can't see because I'm in the way.

221
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,480
Let's fix that.

222
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:45,380
Can you see now?

223
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,579
No, you can't.

224
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:49,940
Can you see it now?

225
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:53,529
There you go.

226
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:55,539
Thanks a lot for the image.

227
00:19:56,259 --> 00:19:57,220
It's very, very good work.

228
00:19:58,019 --> 00:19:58,579
As always.

229
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,720
Keep moving.

230
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,470
The incredible frogman.

231
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,190
Live for one night only in Viva Las Vegas.

232
00:20:08,069 --> 00:20:09,269
Presto Majesto.

233
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,539
7 p.m. Friday.

234
00:20:15,259 --> 00:20:18,309
Wait, isn't today Friday?

235
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:19,910
Well, I don't even know what day it is.

236
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,799
No, it's Sunday.

237
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:25,690
Do you mean live?

238
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,049
Oh, live for one.

239
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:30,009
No, live for one night only.

240
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:31,930
Live for one night only.

241
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,410
Let's correct that record there.

242
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,779
This is cute though.

243
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,819
Good shit.

244
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:42,630
Flip it.

245
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:46,630
Oh yeah, this is cool.

246
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:47,509
We have some cookies.

247
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,930
This is cookie number one.

248
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,890
And then here's cookie number two.

249
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:57,049
Here they are.

250
00:20:57,609 --> 00:21:05,029
You know how hard it is to make cookies that are custom?

251
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,799
It's actually hard to do.

252
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:10,839
It's such a pain in the ass.

253
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:15,259
Real human teeth on this?

254
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:16,220
I didn't even see that.

255
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:18,650
Looks like...

256
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:22,730
No, those are cranberry crunchies.

257
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:24,730
What are they called?

258
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:27,049
Candy cane crunchies.

259
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:29,299
This is good though.

260
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:30,759
Thank you for these.

261
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,259
This is Dura.

262
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:34,220
This is Thunder.

263
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:37,799
I don't know who I'm supposed to be here, but I'm trying.

264
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:43,000
Cranberry crunchies.

265
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,400
Pog.

266
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:44,859
Pog?

267
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,299
I don't know.

268
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:46,619
Pog?

269
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:47,019
I don't know.

270
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:48,539
Should I be Pog into that?

271
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,140
Is this a legitimate...

272
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,019
I don't know.

273
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:51,500
Let me see.

274
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,460
Let me see what you guys think.

275
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:54,619
Enable Pog.

276
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:54,859
No.

277
00:21:55,819 --> 00:21:57,180
I like seeing it spelled out.

278
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,059
I don't like seeing.

279
00:21:58,059 --> 00:21:59,099
I want to see it spelled out.

280
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,910
To me, it's spelled out.

281
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,190
It's not an emote.

282
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,150
It's just you saying it.

283
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,420
Thunder.

284
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,660
I'm fine, guys.

285
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,059
I was.

286
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:10,700
I was fine.

287
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:15,460
We got a GIF of the planets, which looks good.

288
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:25,269
You know, Earth still has a hat on.

289
00:22:25,269 --> 00:22:30,339
Am I ever going to take the hat off?

290
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,059
This is really good, Delia.

291
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:39,000
I wonder if I should ever take the hat off.

292
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,190
No, please.

293
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:41,829
You better not.

294
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:46,950
He went on vacation three years ago, and he's still wearing his vacation hat.

295
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:49,640
You know what?

296
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:56,039
I got into this idea that my emotes were going to be sentient things that did stuff.

297
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,299
And every six months or so, they would all change because they all did something.

298
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:04,940
And then I did it once with Earth and never did it ever again, and he never took it off.

299
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:11,299
Like, the sun would go somewhere cold and it would get, like, chilly or something.

300
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,819
I don't know.

301
00:23:12,819 --> 00:23:15,210
And then I got lazy and never did it ever again.

302
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,180
But at least one of them did something fun.

303
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:22,839
This is during the Jump King stream.

304
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:24,839
This is supposed to be you guys, I don't know, comforting me.

305
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,970
That was a hard game.

306
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:31,589
Earth had a really good time.

307
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:36,259
I love it's on this old-ass TV, too.

308
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:49,660
Put a scarf on Venus.

309
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:56,380
Look at this dude.

310
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,099
Let's get up close.

311
00:23:58,579 --> 00:23:58,980
Dermba.

312
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,740
It's Alex, Kim, Otto.

313
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,980
Who loves Fireman?

314
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:12,259
Fireman is just, it's just everything, it's just the energy that Fireman gives off.

315
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,589
It's just what, it's how I want to live every day.

316
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,400
You know what I mean?

317
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:22,329
Oh, no PP.

318
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:26,019
It's Alex and Otto don't have a PP.

319
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,619
What?

320
00:24:27,619 --> 00:24:32,150
Paul Don.

321
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:36,150
PP like the fucking mana, I know.

322
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:38,460
Nancy Drew.

323
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,660
Drew Crew, where you at?

324
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,700
I know you're in here somewhere.

325
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,650
No, no, no, don't worry.

326
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,609
I don't have to say, they'll make themselves known very quickly.

327
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,369
I don't have to, do I really have to say anything?

328
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:53,420
Hey, how can you tell if somebody's in the Drew Crew?

329
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,150
Oh, don't worry, they'll tell you.

330
00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:05,190
That was long and loud.

331
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:08,039
There are dozens of us.

332
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,339
All 30 of them.

333
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:23,180
This is funny though, thank you.

334
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,700
We got this boomer, let us handle it.

335
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,900
Twitch plays Dermba.

336
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:36,680
I thought these were sweat stains for a second.

337
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,319
I was like, yep.

338
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:42,789
Wait, they are.

339
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,380
Oh, they are.

340
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,579
They are actually, it's sweat.

341
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,420
It's just these gross, sweaty stains.

342
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:49,900
All right, cool.

343
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:52,220
Nice work.

344
00:25:53,589 --> 00:25:54,390
That's very clever.

345
00:25:56,819 --> 00:25:57,779
False start.

346
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,700
Look at this dude.

347
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:04,329
We're gross.

348
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:07,640
You belong to us, old man.

349
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:13,019
Happy New Year 2020.

350
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:13,740
This guy's fucked.

351
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,740
There's the one guy having some drinks.

352
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,619
That's good, that's all right.

353
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:19,500
Just don't go too far.

354
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:20,940
Don't drink too much.

355
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:24,170
You're in the legal age of alcohol,

356
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:26,089
able to divide into your county,

357
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:28,890
and you're legally of age to do it.

358
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,250
Then have some, don't have too much,

359
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,769
and just be safe and take care of yourself.

360
00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:32,650
That's it.

361
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:33,529
How old is one guy?

362
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:37,099
30.

363
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:52,380
We have to show them.

364
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,500
We showed these on stream already.

365
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,299
What was that?

366
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:55,660
We showed these already on stream.

367
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:00,970
But this, they're too good to not just have up

368
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:01,769
for like a minute.

369
00:27:02,569 --> 00:27:04,359
And there are a few of these.

370
00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:13,509
I love these so much.

371
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:14,789
This is so fucking stupid.

372
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:25,000
This one actually is scary

373
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,039
because they didn't do any doctoring.

374
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:32,440
They just kind of, it looked like a parrot.

375
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,720
It looked like a parakeet.

376
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:37,769
Some kind of fucking bird.

377
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,180
Silent Hill.

378
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:49,779
There's Dr. Schmeichsen.

379
00:27:49,779 --> 00:27:50,900
I think we've shown this already,

380
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,339
but it was good enough to show again.

381
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,779
This was edited.

382
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:55,059
I mean, it was.

383
00:27:55,779 --> 00:27:58,339
That's such a great image.

384
00:27:58,339 --> 00:28:03,269
That like, what a great guy.

385
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,490
Everybody loves the doc.

386
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:07,369
Dr. Schmeichsen.

387
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:12,250
What about clown lady fan art?

388
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:12,890
Excuse me.

389
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:15,779
You mean Miss Polly Polite?

390
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:19,400
Doesn't sound like you're a real fan.

391
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:29,859
Happy birthday to whoever's birthday it is.

392
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:33,000
This is really cute.

393
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,319
I like this.

394
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:41,930
What kind of cake is that though?

395
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:42,410
I wonder.

396
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:49,619
I love this one.

397
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:50,680
I love it.

398
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,640
I just love the teeth.

399
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,519
The little like, the little teeth sticking out.

400
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,779
It's adorable.

401
00:28:56,779 --> 00:28:57,579
I love it.

402
00:28:57,579 --> 00:28:59,430
Fuck you Joel.

403
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,549
Yeah, this is when I was going to leave without paying.

404
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,700
Fuck you Joel again.

405
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,299
Hope you have enough money lol.

406
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:13,990
This looks like a movie poster for a Zoomer horror movie.

407
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:21,799
The Great Canadian FK Club.

408
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:22,759
20 community subs.

409
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,500
20 community subs.

410
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:25,740
You what?

411
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,779
You gave six earlier too.

412
00:29:26,779 --> 00:29:29,079
26 community subs, Canadian.

413
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:30,039
That's a lot of money.

414
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:30,359
Thank you.

415
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:33,700
20 community subs.

416
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:38,039
From fucking Great Canadian.

417
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:41,299
Thanks a lot man.

418
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:44,339
Yeah, this would be like a movie called like,

419
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:45,940
Don't Download This or something, right?

420
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:49,079
I get like infected through like a virus in my computer

421
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,279
and I turn into a murderer or something.

422
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:50,599
I don't know.

423
00:29:57,369 --> 00:29:58,730
Dude, hype train.

424
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,660
Jerm, stop talking.

425
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:07,349
No!

426
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:12,549
Sorry, I couldn't look at that one.

427
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:13,509
Teeth posing.

428
00:30:14,309 --> 00:30:15,190
Teeth posing.

429
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:20,150
This is a, this is a real curtain, right?

430
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:23,430
From that fucking website that I'm not going to say the name of anymore.

431
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:29,829
This would scare the shit out of me all the time.

432
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:32,309
I would be, I'd wake up a couple times a week,

433
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:34,869
really groggy, open the door to my bathroom and go,

434
00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:35,369
Ah!

435
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:36,650
Gonna kill me?

436
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:37,369
No, it's okay.

437
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:44,410
It's just that fucking dumb thing I wasted money on.

438
00:30:44,569 --> 00:30:46,170
The Jerm Lane.

439
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:49,210
Oh yeah, this is like a character in some RPG or something.

440
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:49,609
I don't know.

441
00:30:49,609 --> 00:30:51,609
That has like a rat and it looks like me.

442
00:30:51,609 --> 00:30:52,490
This is real.

443
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:56,710
Frequency on common.

444
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,430
Armor class.

445
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:57,930
Move.

446
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:58,950
Hip dice.

447
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:59,750
One to four points.

448
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:03,109
Occasionally getting visions of games to good boys and girls.

449
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:04,470
Jerm Lane or Jermy.

450
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:07,109
Something that's known as Bain Mejiz.

451
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,430
Well and elaborate tunnel and den.

452
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:09,910
Is this real?

453
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:10,789
Somebody fuck this up.

454
00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:11,910
This is like a joke, right?

455
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:19,690
I don't understand.

456
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:22,309
Like yeah, somebody, yeah, this has to be fake.

457
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:24,710
This is like, it's that fucking, it's that face.

458
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:26,740
This is not real.

459
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,509
There's like a lore with it.

460
00:31:29,509 --> 00:31:30,730
I don't know.

461
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:32,569
I can't tell from the pixelization.

462
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:33,069
Hold on.

463
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,299
This is a lot of info for it to be fake.

464
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,910
This is a ton, this is like a ton of info for it to be fake.

465
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:47,779
Jerm Lane are very fast, moving with scuttling, gay, very quiet.

466
00:31:47,779 --> 00:31:49,619
And a master's remaining unseen.

467
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:51,779
Now where's like the one line that says like,

468
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:53,779
Oh and he's like compact and look at me, right?

469
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:54,740
This has to be somewhere.

470
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,589
Can I speak their own tongue?

471
00:31:57,589 --> 00:32:00,859
And your fans are dedicated.

472
00:32:00,859 --> 00:32:02,539
No, this is, this is definitely not real.

473
00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:03,579
They like, look at this.

474
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:04,940
I see the editing.

475
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,019
Look at that.

476
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:08,799
Busted.

477
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,019
Yep.

478
00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:13,299
Oh, get absolutely busted.

479
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:17,539
Look at how different that looks.

480
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:18,259
Look at it.

481
00:32:18,259 --> 00:32:19,220
You didn't smooth it out.

482
00:32:20,259 --> 00:32:20,759
Busted.

483
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:25,289
It is real.

484
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,420
J-E-P-G artifacts.

485
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:33,339
Oh, this is, this is a real character in a game.

486
00:32:33,339 --> 00:32:34,700
Or in a Dungeons and Dragons thing.

487
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:40,809
All right, but wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

488
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,079
They, this, this is not, this is fake.

489
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:57,269
This is that, this is the, that's the face has to be edited.

490
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:00,980
You know, look at the floor.

491
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,019
It's not, it doesn't match up.

492
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,799
It's compression.

493
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:08,900
Oh, the face is shopped.

494
00:33:09,769 --> 00:33:10,569
Yeah, whatever.

495
00:33:10,569 --> 00:33:11,690
Is that, that's real though?

496
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,130
That's strange.

497
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:21,779
Oh, in motion for 3,000 minutes?

498
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,769
How is this a book?

499
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:32,009
I don't understand the book.

500
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:37,339
This is, this, I think the tagline was this,

501
00:33:37,339 --> 00:33:39,099
fireman got into the makeup cabinet.

502
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,180
Wink got redeemed.

503
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:48,680
All right.

504
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,059
Look at that, look at that.

505
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:02,440
Don't wink over the image.

506
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,640
Well, I, I, I'm, I'm, I can only be in here.

507
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,079
I can't be outside of this box.

508
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:09,079
I can't go over here.

509
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:09,800
I'm stuck in here.

510
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:11,940
Full screen?

511
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,420
I just did.

512
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,070
Full screen the camera.

513
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,059
No, that's not part of the deal.

514
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:20,340
If you get a wink, you get a wink.

515
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,260
It doesn't say full screen wink.

516
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,619
How's it?

517
00:34:23,619 --> 00:34:24,119
It doesn't.

518
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:35,659
Plus like, subscribe for more.

519
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:37,019
Plus like if you did.

520
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,719
All right, these fucking hurt my head.

521
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,760
I don't want to look at this.

522
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:55,639
Is it the smile that does it?

523
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,840
Is it my like, it has to be right?

524
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:02,840
Did people paint my hair green and do the makeup on me?

525
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,719
Because I go like this.

526
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:07,880
And then I got a fucking long ass chin.

527
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,380
I get it.

528
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:09,559
I get it.

529
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:11,000
I'm, I'm the Riddler though.

530
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,039
I'm not the Joker.

531
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:12,840
I am the Riddler.

532
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:16,280
No, I'm the, I'm not going to say that.

533
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,840
I'm, I was going to say I was a combination of the penguin and the Riddler.

534
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,320
That doesn't, I don't want to say those words together.

535
00:35:26,139 --> 00:35:28,219
But I, I like the peng, like, I don't know.

536
00:35:28,219 --> 00:35:29,739
Danny DeVito is fucking crazy.

537
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:31,630
Too late.

538
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:44,559
Scary.

539
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,539
That's a scary image.

540
00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:47,039
Otto.

541
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,860
We've shown this image before, but it's so nice.

542
00:35:53,699 --> 00:35:55,539
He's so, look at how cute he is.

543
00:35:59,989 --> 00:36:01,429
Wearing his little jacket too.

544
00:36:01,429 --> 00:36:02,309
He has this jacket.

545
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:09,579
It was exactly what he looks like.

546
00:36:12,489 --> 00:36:15,929
Uh, the lovely classic sensible haircut germa.

547
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,269
Whatever this is versus whatever this is.

548
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,909
Eyes aren't that fucking close together.

549
00:36:29,909 --> 00:36:30,409
Okay.

550
00:36:30,409 --> 00:36:33,449
Like, my nose might be that big, but I'm not.

551
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:39,480
This is, this is like the kind of shit like I get.

552
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:39,980
Okay.

553
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:44,489
This is like a, I opened up like, this is a caricature artist did this.

554
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:48,670
And I feel like I'm like, I'm some like a politician or something.

555
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,230
You know what I mean?

556
00:36:49,869 --> 00:36:52,110
Like I'm like, this is like a politician caricature.

557
00:36:57,789 --> 00:37:25,079
That's like, I got fucking more hair than that.

558
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:28,349
I got more hair than that.

559
00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:30,030
I got more hair than that.

560
00:37:30,829 --> 00:37:32,570
That's funny though.

561
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:33,849
That's actually pretty good work too.

562
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:35,610
Who is this supposed to be?

563
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:37,130
Is this supposed to be me?

564
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,840
No, I'll tell you what this is.

565
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:52,679
The lovely classic sensible 26 year old Jeremy versus what happens when you get to 35.

566
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:55,639
There's aging.

567
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:58,760
People get older and they look a little different.

568
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:04,280
You get older and things change.

569
00:38:11,019 --> 00:38:11,739
35.

570
00:38:11,739 --> 00:38:14,139
Yeah, I, you guys already know this shit.

571
00:38:14,139 --> 00:38:15,579
Do I have to say this out loud over and over?

572
00:38:15,579 --> 00:38:17,420
I'm turning 35 this year.

573
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:19,900
That sucks.

574
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:22,800
35.

575
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,039
It's so, I'm like a hundred.

576
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:30,320
I'm not, if you think I'm turning 35, you're fucking crazy.

577
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,239
This is a German noir and I'm being haunted apparently from my old self.

578
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:54,440
I fucking hate this image.

579
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,460
I hate this image so much.

580
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:01,550
Oh, I hate it.

581
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,989
This is like the worst image ever.

582
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:13,320
It just like, it just looks so bad and shitty.

583
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,679
Not even like funny shitty.

584
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:16,039
It just looks bad.

585
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,820
Sour please broken for anybody else.

586
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,380
Let's find out.

587
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:27,079
No, it works.

588
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,760
Thank you, Germa.

589
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:39,530
Cares makes me happy.

590
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:45,019
It's very sweet.

591
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,570
He's farming sour please.

592
00:39:49,449 --> 00:39:52,510
How do you farm sour please?

593
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,110
Just put any, put any song on.

594
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:55,800
You'll get it forever.

595
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:03,019
He's no friend of mine.

596
00:40:03,579 --> 00:40:15,099
No, no, I'm talking about that person that's, no, no.

597
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:18,380
No, I'm talking about the person that just said that.

598
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,460
I'm saying, I'm not your friend now.

599
00:40:21,179 --> 00:40:23,480
Well, you're not invited to my fucking birthday party.

600
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,320
There's going to be 50,000 people there.

601
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,610
I love the sleepy rat.

602
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:34,650
Relationship with Germa over.

603
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,139
Who the fuck is your new best friend?

604
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:39,920
Who?

605
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,420
You got to finish that.

606
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,619
You can't just say the first part.

607
00:40:42,619 --> 00:40:43,119
Who?

608
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:45,550
Joel.

609
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,570
This is really nice though.

610
00:40:52,570 --> 00:41:05,820
I'm in 50 years.

611
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,940
That doesn't even look that bad.

612
00:41:07,659 --> 00:41:10,619
If I look like this when I'm 60.

613
00:41:11,179 --> 00:41:12,300
Am I really going to care?

614
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,019
That looks okay.

615
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:15,260
I'll be, that's fine.

616
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,500
Nice eye.

617
00:41:18,219 --> 00:41:22,429
This is not a real image.

618
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,750
People, oh wow, dude.

619
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,309
Look at your eye.

620
00:41:25,309 --> 00:41:26,670
Your eye looks like it's fucked up.

621
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,469
Yeah, this is not a real image.

622
00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:31,389
What are we, are we dead?

623
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:40,219
We're good.

624
00:41:40,219 --> 00:41:41,500
Just hang tight.

625
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,829
2020 year of the rat.

626
00:41:44,829 --> 00:41:46,139
This is true.

627
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:47,179
Actually is year of the rat.

628
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:52,969
A lot of them.

629
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,380
I like the eyes on this one.

630
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,099
They're very sheeny, shiny.

631
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,699
Looks really good.

632
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:08,440
We better get a new rat emote this year.

633
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:10,269
I mean you kind of have to.

634
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,190
Eventually.

635
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,309
Whenever I decide to do it.

636
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:16,750
Hopefully soon.

637
00:42:17,949 --> 00:42:18,989
I'd put this on the wall.

638
00:42:19,789 --> 00:42:21,710
I gotta have some cool shit on the wall.

639
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:22,349
Don't I?

640
00:42:22,349 --> 00:42:23,230
I gotta have like, I gotta,

641
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,750
I gotta make like a streamer room.

642
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,250
Don't I?

643
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:28,300
Right?

644
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,500
I gotta have a streamer room.

645
00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:34,250
Yeah, I want, I want,

646
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,329
I want a blue light.

647
00:42:36,329 --> 00:42:37,369
And a pink light.

648
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,289
And a red light.

649
00:42:39,289 --> 00:42:40,170
And they just,

650
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:41,530
that's how you can tell it's a streamer room.

651
00:42:42,809 --> 00:42:45,369
I need like a blue light back here.

652
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:51,289
Streamer cave, yeah.

653
00:42:51,289 --> 00:42:56,539
That actually would hurt my head.

654
00:42:57,579 --> 00:43:00,300
You know, I see a lot of people have lights.

655
00:43:01,099 --> 00:43:05,340
Like bright orange, purple, pink lights back here.

656
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,219
Like in their room.

657
00:43:06,219 --> 00:43:09,500
I feel like it'd be like, it would hurt me.

658
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,820
It would be like UV raised in my head.

659
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,699
I wouldn't want to do that.

660
00:43:16,139 --> 00:43:16,639
What is this?

661
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:23,820
Did you go too fast?

662
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:24,380
I can't clear it.

663
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:29,400
This is actually pretty funny.

664
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,210
This is pretty funny.

665
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:35,289
Yeah, this is funny.

666
00:43:35,289 --> 00:43:36,489
It's funny.

667
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:38,730
Oh, okay, I will, I will allow this one.

668
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:41,050
I allow this one.

669
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:50,139
It's like, it's, it could be real.

670
00:43:50,139 --> 00:44:02,039
It's, I feel like, this is like,

671
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,900
I feel like this is the type of image that you actually have

672
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,619
when you go so overboard

673
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:12,539
and you're trying so hard to like,

674
00:44:12,539 --> 00:44:15,260
have a good Tinder profile picture

675
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,019
that it ends up looking like this

676
00:44:17,019 --> 00:44:19,579
because you've taken a hundred fucking pictures.

677
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:22,360
And finally you get this one.

678
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,880
You're like, you've seen the same image of you

679
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,239
trying to do a good picture a thousand times.

680
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:32,039
And it's like, I guess that's that one.

681
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:35,039
And then people scroll through this and like, holy shit.

682
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:45,019
Like, why, why is Jerma using Tinder?

683
00:44:45,019 --> 00:44:46,139
I used to use Tinder.

684
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:49,480
I used to use Tinder before Kim.

685
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:50,840
You guys knew that.

686
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,119
I used to talk about it all the time.

687
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:55,000
He's talking about like all the fucked up shit that happened.

688
00:44:55,639 --> 00:44:56,840
You guys don't remember that?

689
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:00,940
What do the old viewers do?

690
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:04,059
That's how he met Kim.

691
00:45:04,059 --> 00:45:05,340
I did not meet Kim on Tinder.

692
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,300
That's not what happened.

693
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,760
No, I don't have like a story like,

694
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,440
oh, I super liked her.

695
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,639
She super liked me back.

696
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,760
Rats, we're rats.

697
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,480
We're the rats.

698
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,119
We pray at night.

699
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:21,760
We stalk at night.

700
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,320
We're the rats.

701
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:24,800
I'm the giant rat who makes all the rules.

702
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,159
These are not even rats.

703
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:27,360
These are dogs or something.

704
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:27,840
What is this?

705
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:32,320
What the fuck is this?

706
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,119
These are dogs.

707
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,159
Although I do like this one so much.

708
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,199
Why can't this animal exist?

709
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:44,239
I want one.

710
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:45,199
Don't you want one of these?

711
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:53,119
10 seconds.

712
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,000
I want one of those.

713
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,039
It's a doge.

714
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:00,079
I know what it is, but this is not, that's not a doge.

715
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,360
That's, this is a rat dog gerbil thing.

716
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,429
The wizard in the boulder.

717
00:46:08,429 --> 00:46:09,230
What's on the ATM?

718
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:10,989
It's me, the wizard.

719
00:46:10,989 --> 00:46:13,869
I telepathically downloaded my soul into this ATM.

720
00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:15,389
From AI dungeon.

721
00:46:15,389 --> 00:46:19,150
Otto is literally a rat dog.

722
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:19,550
Yes, I know.

723
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:20,590
He's a rat terrier.

724
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:22,030
Noxon.

725
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:24,989
We've confirmed that with genetic DNA.

726
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:30,489
This is good shit though, thank you.

727
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:34,429
Oh, the banana milk in the bag.

728
00:46:35,469 --> 00:46:37,789
What is this?

729
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:41,400
What is this?

730
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:48,059
Oh, I thought this was liquid.

731
00:46:48,619 --> 00:46:50,429
I thought this was like Gatorade.

732
00:46:50,429 --> 00:46:51,150
Oh, that's the bread.

733
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:51,710
That's the bread.

734
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:52,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

735
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:55,710
You always gotta bring enough bread and cheese and oatmeal and shit.

736
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:12,860
This is another picture that I like wish I could delete.

737
00:47:14,139 --> 00:47:16,010
It's just fucking scary.

738
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:22,719
You look like you have encouraged the cowardly dog.

739
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:25,949
Was this your Tinder pic?

740
00:47:26,829 --> 00:47:27,949
No, it wasn't.

741
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,159
No.

742
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,780
Okay, I just like laugh internally a little bit.

743
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,539
Like my chest just kind of popped.

744
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,519
Imagine this was your profile picture on Tinder.

745
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:45,849
You get reported.

746
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:48,719
Hey, look at that.

747
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,719
Okay, add a five and then add a one and then add another one.

748
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,079
Then you'd be correct.

749
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,320
Add a five, turn this into a five and then make this, turn this into an eight.

750
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:06,110
Now you're basing that on that one image of that white thing and it was a joke.

751
00:48:06,989 --> 00:48:08,510
Come on, you guys can't take a joke.

752
00:48:14,889 --> 00:48:17,449
Four, five, four, what?

753
00:48:17,449 --> 00:48:21,289
Six, and then five, eight, five, eight, whatever.

754
00:48:22,329 --> 00:48:24,590
Good shit.

755
00:48:25,389 --> 00:48:26,190
Say the line.

756
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:26,750
What line?

757
00:48:27,469 --> 00:48:29,789
What do you mean line?

758
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:33,079
Got the coffee right though.

759
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:36,510
I love coffee.

760
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:37,960
I'm a big coffee fan.

761
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,519
I get it from my mother.

762
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:47,179
My mother drinks coffee a lot and I drink coffee a lot now too.

763
00:48:49,739 --> 00:48:50,300
Chicken.

764
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:53,449
I actually did buy chicken and I bought Cheetos.

765
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:55,389
Yes, say the line.

766
00:48:56,030 --> 00:48:57,630
Say the line, say the line.

767
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:00,110
Coffee, Cheetos, chicken, everybody.

768
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:03,150
This is from PeacefulHaley.

769
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:05,150
I was during the FTK stream.

770
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,590
How did you get it up there?

771
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:07,469
How did you even do this?

772
00:49:08,349 --> 00:49:09,550
How did you get that up there?

773
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,800
Wait, did you build this and then jump off?

774
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:19,869
Afterwards.

775
00:49:19,869 --> 00:49:24,139
Oh, this is like the crowning achievement.

776
00:49:24,139 --> 00:49:25,340
And then it was like, I got to get down.

777
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:28,559
The scaffolding.

778
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:29,760
There's no scaffolding though.

779
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,480
How did you do this?

780
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:31,840
How did you get down?

781
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,719
You're bad at Minecraft.

782
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:37,579
You can't be bad at Minecraft.

783
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:39,840
You can't.

784
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:42,000
It doesn't, there's no such thing.

785
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,480
No, you cannot be bad at Minecraft.

786
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:45,679
You can't.

787
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:50,650
You cannot be bad at Minecraft.

788
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:52,969
You can't.

789
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:58,269
How can you be bad at Minecraft?

790
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,139
You forgot to wear armor.

791
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:07,550
But that's like saying you're bad at LEGOs.

792
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:09,230
You can't, can you be bad at LEGOs?

793
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:13,179
Oh, actually, it's like, hold on.

794
00:50:13,179 --> 00:50:14,300
That's a little different.

795
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,739
It's like if you were making LEGOs

796
00:50:15,739 --> 00:50:17,579
and people were trying to like break your door down

797
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:18,619
and like kill you.

798
00:50:19,659 --> 00:50:20,780
Actually, you never mind.

799
00:50:21,659 --> 00:50:25,880
Like while you're doing LEGOs,

800
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,719
there's just like monsters outside.

801
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,869
Oh, yeah.

802
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,409
Yeah, that's true.

803
00:50:32,409 --> 00:50:32,809
That's right.

804
00:50:33,769 --> 00:50:35,449
You can be bad at Minecraft.

805
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:39,050
You can't be bad at creative mode.

806
00:50:39,449 --> 00:50:40,969
You can't die with LEGOs.

807
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:45,130
I'm saying Minecraft is sort of just like digital LEGOs,

808
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:47,690
but there's monsters trying to kill you.

809
00:50:48,329 --> 00:50:49,130
So I was wrong.

810
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:50,889
I misspoke when I said that LEGOs,

811
00:50:50,889 --> 00:50:53,769
if you went, if you had, you know, I misspoke.

812
00:50:55,289 --> 00:50:56,010
It's not.

813
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:56,570
How is it not?

814
00:50:58,730 --> 00:50:59,289
What?

815
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:01,130
How is Minecraft not like digital LEGOs?

816
00:51:03,019 --> 00:51:04,380
You can absolutely die with LEGOs.

817
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:05,340
You ever stepped on one?

818
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,719
Stop stalling.

819
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:09,199
You can't.

820
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:09,760
You can't.

821
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:18,429
You're backtracking now.

822
00:51:18,429 --> 00:51:18,929
What?

823
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:22,030
Hey, look at this dude.

824
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:25,150
Literally, my grandpa has said that.

825
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:27,150
What did somebody just say?

826
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:30,030
Minus two funny Facebook, Instagram humor.

827
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:34,750
What the fuck are you talking about?

828
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:37,230
Oh, really?

829
00:51:37,869 --> 00:51:41,280
Funny Facebook, Instagram humor.

830
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,199
I don't have an Instagram,

831
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:48,909
and I don't have a Facebook, Instagram humor.

832
00:51:48,909 --> 00:51:50,679
I don't have a Facebook, Instagram humor.

833
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:52,280
I don't have a Facebook, Instagram humor.

834
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,960
I don't have a Facebook, Instagram humor.

835
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,239
And I don't have a Facebook.

836
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,179
So I would just call that shitty humor.

837
00:51:59,179 --> 00:51:59,820
Get it right.

838
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,760
Oh, really?

839
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:09,610
We struck a nerve on that one.

840
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:10,570
I already have a Facebook.

841
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:13,800
I don't have a Facebook account.

842
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,400
I don't have an, well, there is an Instagram account.

843
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,039
It's not mine.

844
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:20,760
Somebody made a fucking fake Instagram account,

845
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,599
and it's just been there for like 10 years.

846
00:52:22,599 --> 00:52:23,480
I don't fucking even know.

847
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,440
I'm not connected to it at all.

848
00:52:25,639 --> 00:52:26,440
Oh, Cheeto.

849
00:52:27,159 --> 00:52:29,710
I really like these ones, actually.

850
00:52:30,429 --> 00:52:41,929
You're licking my, yeah, I posted on there like in 2012.

851
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:46,880
Is this paint?

852
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:47,679
This is on a canvas.

853
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:52,780
This is actually on a canvas, right?

854
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,300
I mean, it looks, this looks great.

855
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,300
I love that smile.

856
00:53:01,869 --> 00:53:02,829
Canvas effect.

857
00:53:05,869 --> 00:53:06,429
This again?

858
00:53:06,429 --> 00:53:07,389
What do you mean this again?

859
00:53:07,949 --> 00:53:12,079
Click the link, click the link, click the link.

860
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:24,880
This is when, when chat hears Jerma go on a rant.

861
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:15,840
Damn it.

862
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,480
No, no.

863
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,840
I'm just going to start talking in like

864
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,599
fucking nutritional labels.

865
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:24,480
I'm not going to talk about,

866
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,559
I'm not going off on any more like weird,

867
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,400
like reaching and talking about rant.

868
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,480
No, I'm just going to read like the nutritional facts

869
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,599
and that's it.

870
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:32,559
No more talking.

871
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:37,880
God damn it.

872
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:41,230
Oh, dude, Royal Rumble.

873
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:41,869
It's tonight?

874
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,480
Oh my God.

875
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,699
I'm going to, I'm going to only tell you guys

876
00:54:52,699 --> 00:54:55,019
fucking jokes like from popsicle sticks from now on.

877
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:57,639
This is great though.

878
00:54:57,639 --> 00:54:58,119
It's beautiful.

879
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:17,260
You're a cartoon character.

880
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:22,880
I've been called worse.

881
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:30,670
Yo dude, I noticed that you're alone.

882
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:31,789
Do you need a spot or anything?

883
00:55:31,789 --> 00:55:33,230
Just talk to me if you need anything.

884
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:42,079
This guy's fucking huge.

885
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:46,320
The farting is screaming.

886
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:46,820
Yeah.

887
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:48,719
This dude's focused.

888
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:58,159
This is really funny.

889
00:55:58,159 --> 00:55:58,659
Good work.

890
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:07,159
What's wrong with this guy?

891
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,239
There's nothing wrong with me.

892
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:11,519
Okay.

893
00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:19,869
This is in the background.

894
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:23,440
I can't say what this one's called.

895
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,039
I can't say what this one's called.

896
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,800
Apologize.

897
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:31,559
Doesn't count.

898
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:33,000
I don't have to apologize unless I say it.

899
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:41,480
This is a fucking E3 awards.

900
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,679
Nice sound.

901
00:56:42,679 --> 00:56:43,239
Very good.

902
00:56:43,239 --> 00:56:43,719
Hmm.

903
00:56:43,719 --> 00:56:44,119
Yeah.

904
00:56:44,119 --> 00:56:44,619
Cool.

905
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:55,260
Excellent art.

906
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:56,219
Yeah, this is good.

907
00:56:56,219 --> 00:56:56,940
This is really good.

908
00:56:57,659 --> 00:57:07,679
The streams are always so strange.

909
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:12,960
Those E3 streams.

910
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:16,110
There's always something wrong with them.

911
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:19,869
Look at this.

912
00:57:20,829 --> 00:57:23,230
Can you fucking even imagine?

913
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:24,429
This is a photo.

914
00:57:24,429 --> 00:57:25,389
This is a photograph.

915
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,519
Picture of my face.

916
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:40,039
Like this.

917
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,079
That's so well done.

918
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,599
It's incredible.

919
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:44,599
Incredible.

920
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,159
Nice fucking work.

921
00:57:56,699 --> 00:57:59,019
Nice Arthus Menethil hair.

922
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:01,579
Nice.

923
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:02,760
That's a new one.

924
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,280
That's a new-

925
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:06,840
I like that one.

926
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:07,880
That's a new one.

927
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:08,380
That's cool.

928
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:11,210
You guys should say that now.

929
00:58:11,929 --> 00:58:12,889
Instead of goblin.

930
00:58:13,769 --> 00:58:14,889
Or peasant hair.

931
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:16,489
Or Farquaad.

932
00:58:16,489 --> 00:58:17,050
I like that one.

933
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:17,849
Arthus Menethil.

934
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:19,530
That's what it is in canon.

935
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:28,360
A fantastic work.

936
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,119
Let's get in real close.

937
00:58:33,949 --> 00:58:35,389
You can get like the bump too.

938
00:58:35,389 --> 00:58:36,510
You got the bump correct.

939
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:39,230
Let's look at this.

940
00:58:39,869 --> 00:58:41,519
It's crazy.

941
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,380
Some of you guys are so fucking talented.

942
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:45,019
It's ridiculous.

943
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:50,400
Awesome job.

944
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:57,159
I love it.

945
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:58,519
There is Drew Carey.

946
00:59:00,219 --> 00:59:01,900
Oh, I'm so sorry.

947
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:02,860
Sorry, what I meant to say was

948
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:03,980
it's a picture of Nightwing.

949
00:59:04,619 --> 00:59:06,329
Could be anybody.

950
00:59:06,329 --> 00:59:22,190
He said some, not all.

951
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:23,150
He hates us.

952
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:24,030
You're all right.

953
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:26,119
What song is playing?

954
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:27,079
I have no idea.

955
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,480
Uh, this is our number.

956
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,880
This is 51 minutes into the three hours

957
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,079
of Animal Crossing music.

958
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:34,639
I don't know if there's a...

959
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:37,199
All right, hold on.

960
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:40,010
Uh, this, that song was just called

961
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:43,960
New Leaf.

962
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:44,460
Wait.

963
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:48,440
Okay, that's New Leaf, 7 p.m.

964
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:52,400
Yeah, let's hear it twice.

965
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:59,050
Look at how just fucked up this is too.

966
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:00,170
Look at this image.

967
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:03,000
It's like, all right, you started here.

968
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,039
You're like, all right, let me get

969
01:00:04,039 --> 01:00:05,079
like a nice clean line.

970
01:00:05,079 --> 01:00:07,159
And then you're like, at some point

971
01:00:07,159 --> 01:00:08,119
you're like, fuck it.

972
01:00:08,119 --> 01:00:09,320
I'm putting the Nightwing symbol

973
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:09,960
on Drew Carey.

974
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:16,969
Fuck it, Friday.

975
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,360
I love this though.

976
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:19,840
Thank you.

977
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:20,719
It's fucking hilarious.

978
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:24,590
Uh, is that Omega symbol?

979
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:25,070
I don't get it.

980
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:28,489
Omega.

981
01:00:28,489 --> 01:00:31,610
Click this link.

982
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:32,730
I will in a minute.

983
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:34,489
We're doing community content part two night.

984
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:35,550
What is it?

985
01:00:43,159 --> 01:00:44,679
Yeah, I mean, yeah, we showed

986
01:00:44,679 --> 01:00:46,440
the credit card already a couple times.

987
01:00:47,239 --> 01:00:48,760
We already showed the credit card.

988
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,480
We've shown, we've shown the credit card.

989
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:55,119
And it's weird to say that I've shown

990
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,800
a viewer's credit card on camera.

991
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,000
You know, that's weird to say that.

992
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:02,760
Wrong link.

993
01:01:03,769 --> 01:01:04,650
Oh shit.

994
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:05,449
Oh my God.

995
01:01:05,449 --> 01:01:06,250
This is all right.

996
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:07,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

997
01:01:11,239 --> 01:01:11,880
Ready?

998
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:12,440
Check this out.

999
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:14,409
No, no, spoiler.

1000
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:32,280
That's insane.

1001
01:01:33,079 --> 01:01:41,369
How long did this take?

1002
01:01:41,929 --> 01:01:46,010
Oh, I didn't even realize it was digital.

1003
01:01:49,449 --> 01:01:51,769
That's even more impressive, right?

1004
01:01:51,769 --> 01:01:54,380
That's insanity.

1005
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:57,420
I wonder how long that took.

1006
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:57,920
You here?

1007
01:01:58,619 --> 01:01:59,340
You still here?

1008
01:01:59,340 --> 01:01:59,820
You here?

1009
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:00,320
Are you here?

1010
01:02:01,019 --> 01:02:01,980
12 hours?

1011
01:02:02,699 --> 01:02:06,639
Flowers.

1012
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:11,739
Is Apple shift here?

1013
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:17,179
Oh, that's a Omega fireman.

1014
01:02:17,179 --> 01:02:18,059
Omega fireman.

1015
01:02:18,699 --> 01:02:19,900
Observe the individual.

1016
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:26,510
Yeah, I didn't know what this was.

1017
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:27,789
And what do you want me to say?

1018
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:31,550
I also, you know what?

1019
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:32,670
It's more embarrassing to not know

1020
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:33,550
the half-life symbol.

1021
01:02:34,349 --> 01:02:36,960
When you're locked in

1022
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,880
and someone's yelling instructions at you,

1023
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,139
you just forget, forget.

1024
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:47,230
Another rap?

1025
01:02:49,389 --> 01:02:50,190
Lambda, I know.

1026
01:02:50,909 --> 01:02:52,650
He doesn't know.

1027
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:53,530
Omega low.

1028
01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:54,409
Blaming Joel.

1029
01:02:55,369 --> 01:02:57,210
No, Joel had really great instructions.

1030
01:02:58,170 --> 01:03:01,400
Those instructions were actually very, very good.

1031
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,800
I think we turned into a solid team there

1032
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,239
and halfway through into the end.

1033
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:08,159
Cute rap?

1034
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:09,599
Little tail?

1035
01:03:10,239 --> 01:03:11,900
Speaking of which,

1036
01:03:12,699 --> 01:03:21,739
here's one of the times we played it.

1037
01:03:24,409 --> 01:03:24,909
Think.

1038
01:03:25,369 --> 01:03:30,570
How does Joel get armor?

1039
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:32,170
I don't have armor.

1040
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:38,539
I guess I do have armor.

1041
01:03:38,539 --> 01:03:39,579
He's got like, he's got like,

1042
01:03:40,619 --> 01:03:42,639
because he's diffusing.

1043
01:03:42,639 --> 01:03:43,599
I need armor too.

1044
01:03:46,809 --> 01:03:48,090
I want to be in armor.

1045
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:48,650
Where am I?

1046
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:51,230
All right, from the way that I see this,

1047
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:53,159
I guess no, never mind.

1048
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:56,159
I'm not in the same room, is it?

1049
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:57,280
Well, I guess I could be sitting there.

1050
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,480
We could both be looking at the bomb.

1051
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:00,989
So I'm definitely not in the same room.

1052
01:04:00,989 --> 01:04:01,789
So why would I be?

1053
01:04:01,789 --> 01:04:02,909
Yeah, I wouldn't be in armor.

1054
01:04:02,909 --> 01:04:03,309
You're right.

1055
01:04:04,429 --> 01:04:05,309
Leon Kennedy.

1056
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,639
Not strong enough to wear clothes.

1057
01:04:09,639 --> 01:04:10,139
All right.

1058
01:04:18,039 --> 01:04:19,719
I don't know what, I don't know what that means,

1059
01:04:19,719 --> 01:04:21,400
but I'm kind of scared that I just said,

1060
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,840
uh, I don't know what that is.

1061
01:04:25,289 --> 01:04:26,010
Get good.

1062
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:26,489
Here we go.

1063
01:04:26,489 --> 01:04:27,610
Here's another one.

1064
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:29,130
Two plus two equals what?

1065
01:04:29,769 --> 01:04:30,489
With the bomb.

1066
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:32,650
This is really cute.

1067
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,440
It means you eat poop.

1068
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,469
Well, that's hysterical.

1069
01:04:39,469 --> 01:04:43,449
Why doesn't this work?

1070
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:45,210
I'm going to get that to work.

1071
01:04:46,829 --> 01:04:49,710
The ninja get good ultimate guide to gaming.

1072
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:54,219
Doesn't he have one of those?

1073
01:04:55,179 --> 01:04:57,500
Does ninja actually have like a game manual?

1074
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:58,619
How do we go to video games?

1075
01:05:03,179 --> 01:05:03,679
Yes.

1076
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:08,090
Wait, what do you mean?

1077
01:05:08,090 --> 01:05:08,590
Yes.

1078
01:05:13,550 --> 01:05:14,050
Really?

1079
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:20,590
I should probably read this.

1080
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:21,710
Ultra gaming one.

1081
01:05:22,679 --> 01:05:24,679
Ninja get good ultimate gaming.

1082
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:28,170
This is real.

1083
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:32,619
Wait a minute.

1084
01:05:32,619 --> 01:05:38,880
What does he say in the book?

1085
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:39,960
Hold on.

1086
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:42,539
Get good ultimate.

1087
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:48,679
Okay.

1088
01:05:48,679 --> 01:05:49,719
How many pages is this?

1089
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,090
Is this more than 20 pages?

1090
01:05:52,730 --> 01:06:02,079
Get good.

1091
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:03,599
Invest in a gaming mouse.

1092
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:05,119
What makes a good mouse?

1093
01:06:05,679 --> 01:06:09,500
Get a good mouse.

1094
01:06:10,219 --> 01:06:14,570
Developing game sense.

1095
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,079
My biggest win.

1096
01:06:20,969 --> 01:06:22,409
My biggest win ever?

1097
01:06:23,369 --> 01:06:28,800
Like money?

1098
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:36,989
Pillars, the four pillars of improvement.

1099
01:06:36,989 --> 01:06:38,190
I can't believe this is real.

1100
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:39,070
This is wild.

1101
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:46,940
Imagine a regular win.

1102
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:48,059
My biggest win ever.

1103
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,400
Read it on stream.

1104
01:06:54,199 --> 01:06:55,079
Make your own book.

1105
01:06:55,639 --> 01:06:56,579
I can't.

1106
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:00,750
How to lead.

1107
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:03,230
There's like leadership skills in here.

1108
01:07:06,269 --> 01:07:08,110
Suppressing and covering fire.

1109
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:11,469
Suppressive fire, sometimes called covering fire,

1110
01:07:11,469 --> 01:07:13,710
is both tactical and psychological.

1111
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:15,949
Not only does it scare opponents and potentially...

1112
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:17,949
Is this like a military handbook?

1113
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:22,559
Team Tactics 101.

1114
01:07:25,019 --> 01:07:25,980
I'm going to read this book.

1115
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:27,800
I have to.

1116
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,159
It probably won't take me very long.

1117
01:07:29,159 --> 01:07:30,360
I'm going to read that book.

1118
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:32,269
Remember, you don't need that.

1119
01:07:32,269 --> 01:07:34,030
You beat Dark Souls 3 on stream.

1120
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:35,869
Yeah, but I didn't know about suppressing fire.

1121
01:07:35,869 --> 01:07:36,670
I didn't know what that was.

1122
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:40,280
Covering fire?

1123
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:40,920
What the fuck is that?

1124
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:46,780
You beat...

1125
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:48,300
I can't believe that's real.

1126
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:49,500
That's fucking crazy.

1127
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:50,699
Well, good for you, Ninja.

1128
01:07:52,059 --> 01:07:53,639
Got a fucking book.

1129
01:07:53,639 --> 01:07:55,119
I tried to do that once.

1130
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,880
And I wrote like seven pages

1131
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,480
and then gave up because it was too hard.

1132
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,949
So, good on you.

1133
01:08:02,670 --> 01:08:12,079
You beat the Sekiro final boss.

1134
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:17,960
What is this?

1135
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,000
This is not an ammo crossing.

1136
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:19,880
Is it?

1137
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:24,220
facade.

1138
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:31,840
I don't want to show this on stream

1139
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,039
for more than five seconds.

1140
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:33,600
All right.

1141
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,199
This is weird and scary and creepy

1142
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:36,079
and it's a scary face.

1143
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:55,899
For these, this person posted...

1144
01:08:55,899 --> 01:08:57,260
At first, I wasn't going to include these

1145
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:57,659
because I was like,

1146
01:08:57,659 --> 01:08:59,180
what the fuck is this person doing?

1147
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:00,220
There's like three of these.

1148
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:01,100
They just put this.

1149
01:09:01,979 --> 01:09:03,500
And they say, oh, there was some weird images

1150
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:04,220
during the green screen.

1151
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:06,779
But I'm like, all right, what does that have to do with anything?

1152
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:09,520
And then they did this.

1153
01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:19,149
So I was like, okay, I guess I understand.

1154
01:09:19,789 --> 01:09:27,960
That's a person's face.

1155
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:28,680
I don't know.

1156
01:09:35,819 --> 01:09:36,699
Don't get too close.

1157
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:38,140
Don't get too close.

1158
01:09:39,789 --> 01:09:40,109
All right.

1159
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:42,590
I feel like I've woken up a bunch of times

1160
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:46,189
and like that's where Otto's face is.

1161
01:09:46,189 --> 01:09:47,550
This is like if you have a dog

1162
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:50,430
that's like ever been in bed with you

1163
01:09:50,430 --> 01:09:52,270
and you're like snuggling your dog.

1164
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:54,350
It's just like, oh, there you are.

1165
01:09:59,159 --> 01:10:00,039
I don't know what this is,

1166
01:10:00,039 --> 01:10:08,170
but it's pretty detailed, whatever it is.

1167
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:11,609
Zoom back out.

1168
01:10:12,569 --> 01:10:14,029
10K.

1169
01:10:15,229 --> 01:10:16,609
10K.

1170
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:20,090
I don't know if you're referring to.

1171
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:20,970
Look at that fireman.

1172
01:10:20,970 --> 01:10:21,850
It's a beautiful fireman.

1173
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:22,569
Beautiful Shido.

1174
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:26,250
This channel is over 10,000 subs.

1175
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:29,560
I can tell you the exact number right now.

1176
01:10:30,199 --> 01:10:31,800
It hasn't moved in a long time.

1177
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:34,039
It hasn't moved since this January 1st.

1178
01:10:35,479 --> 01:10:39,479
There are 10,773 subscribers on this channel.

1179
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,039
It's fucking ludicrous.

1180
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,199
Uh, yes.

1181
01:10:46,279 --> 01:10:47,579
They're still here.

1182
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:52,640
Good shit.

1183
01:10:53,279 --> 01:10:58,090
That's a lot of spendies.

1184
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:01,439
New tax bracket hype.

1185
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:08,279
That means a lot.

1186
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,199
And speaking of subs,

1187
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:11,720
I said the word subs.

1188
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:12,520
So here we go.

1189
01:11:13,319 --> 01:11:16,220
Thank you, fly for shy for the 10 community subs.

1190
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:18,359
Appreciate it.

1191
01:11:18,359 --> 01:11:18,760
Thank you.

1192
01:11:19,399 --> 01:11:21,550
More on a ton of them are community subs, by the way.

1193
01:11:21,550 --> 01:11:23,949
There's like 5,000 community subs on the channel.

1194
01:11:23,949 --> 01:11:24,430
Something like that.

1195
01:11:24,430 --> 01:11:25,310
Something fucking crazy.

1196
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:28,680
Thanks guys.

1197
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:31,260
Keep going.

1198
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:39,850
What's the cakes?

1199
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:47,050
Minecraft cake?

1200
01:11:51,949 --> 01:11:53,390
Forced subs.

1201
01:11:53,390 --> 01:11:55,130
What?

1202
01:11:55,130 --> 01:11:57,289
No, community sub means you just get a sub.

1203
01:11:57,289 --> 01:12:02,250
Oh, that's actually...

1204
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:02,489
Wait a minute.

1205
01:12:02,489 --> 01:12:02,890
Hold on.

1206
01:12:04,859 --> 01:12:06,539
Are these stickers on the notepad?

1207
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:07,979
Oh, all right.

1208
01:12:07,979 --> 01:12:08,859
That's cool.

1209
01:12:08,859 --> 01:12:12,670
I always have to be...

1210
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:13,630
I'm always crying.

1211
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:14,270
I cry a lot.

1212
01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:16,109
If you're a new viewer, I fucking cry all the time.

1213
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:21,930
I was a for...

1214
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:22,409
I was...

1215
01:12:22,409 --> 01:12:23,770
I was forced into subbing.

1216
01:12:24,989 --> 01:12:25,470
No, what?

1217
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:27,869
A community sub just means you got a sub for free.

1218
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:31,880
Every other stream.

1219
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,079
I don't cry every other stream.

1220
01:12:33,079 --> 01:12:36,039
Only if there's like fucking loud sounds in my ears.

1221
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:48,439
This is really good art.

1222
01:12:49,079 --> 01:12:54,439
All right.

1223
01:12:54,439 --> 01:12:57,079
We need to talk about like images that will come back to haunt me.

1224
01:12:58,970 --> 01:12:59,609
This is like...

1225
01:12:59,609 --> 01:13:00,409
This is one of them, right?

1226
01:13:01,949 --> 01:13:02,829
This is always here.

1227
01:13:02,829 --> 01:13:04,270
And even when like 10 years from now,

1228
01:13:04,270 --> 01:13:07,069
people will be making like photoshops of this image, right?

1229
01:13:07,069 --> 01:13:08,430
That's kind of how that works.

1230
01:13:09,069 --> 01:13:12,670
You need to make that an emote.

1231
01:13:14,319 --> 01:13:15,119
VenomGermo.

1232
01:13:17,979 --> 01:13:18,300
What?

1233
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:18,859
The hand?

1234
01:13:19,659 --> 01:13:21,310
The hand...

1235
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:22,750
Wait, the hand is not art?

1236
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:23,869
It's not like drawn art?

1237
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:25,949
Wait, is it...

1238
01:13:25,949 --> 01:13:26,829
It's like pumped in?

1239
01:13:35,390 --> 01:13:36,350
Oh, it's still cool though.

1240
01:13:37,979 --> 01:13:38,539
I like this.

1241
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:39,979
I don't know how you do this type of stuff,

1242
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:44,170
but like you're watching this on like a TV.

1243
01:13:44,729 --> 01:13:45,689
Like an old...

1244
01:13:45,689 --> 01:13:46,250
You know what I'm saying?

1245
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:46,649
Like these...

1246
01:13:46,649 --> 01:13:47,130
The weird...

1247
01:13:47,930 --> 01:13:50,090
Like kind of chroma...

1248
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:50,649
Whatever it is.

1249
01:13:50,649 --> 01:13:51,210
You know what I'm saying?

1250
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:53,210
It looks like electricity.

1251
01:13:53,210 --> 01:13:55,930
Like it's like a chromatic abrasion.

1252
01:13:55,930 --> 01:13:57,210
Yeah, chromatic abrasion filter.

1253
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:00,140
I said half of it.

1254
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:00,859
I said cro...

1255
01:14:01,819 --> 01:14:03,949
This is really nice.

1256
01:14:03,949 --> 01:14:04,350
Thank you.

1257
01:14:06,350 --> 01:14:07,229
This one's gonna take a minute.

1258
01:14:07,229 --> 01:14:07,470
Okay.

1259
01:14:07,470 --> 01:14:09,789
Internet dependent is up here.

1260
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:11,710
Sane is on the left.

1261
01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:13,390
Insane on the right.

1262
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:15,550
And then internet independent at the bottom.

1263
01:14:16,109 --> 01:14:18,439
So what's the...

1264
01:14:18,439 --> 01:14:20,039
Okay, the extreme up here is...

1265
01:14:21,239 --> 01:14:22,359
Internet dependent.

1266
01:14:22,359 --> 01:14:25,399
Twitch TV transhumanist bionic boomer AI.

1267
01:14:25,399 --> 01:14:27,359
But sane.

01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:35,869
Immortal meme god of the century.

01:14:35,869 --> 01:14:38,590
Complete user controlled vessel.

1271
01:14:39,229 --> 01:14:44,510
All right, now moving more towards sane,

1272
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:46,189
but still internet dependent.

1273
01:14:46,569 --> 01:14:48,489
Colitis immune superclone.

1274
01:14:48,489 --> 01:14:49,770
Derma 987.

1275
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,409
Yeah, cool.

1276
01:14:54,409 --> 01:14:56,649
Savvy vet tech substitute teacher.

1277
01:14:59,149 --> 01:15:02,029

1278
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:06,439
Psychopathic egotistical monstrosity.

1279
01:15:07,659 --> 01:15:08,539
Is over in insane.

1280
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:13,079
All right, now we're insane and little...

1281
01:15:13,079 --> 01:15:14,920
And less internet dependent.

1282
01:15:15,789 --> 01:15:18,670
Old age Kim and Jeremy Albertson family lineage.

1283
01:15:18,670 --> 01:15:19,710
That sounds kind of good to me.

1284
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:22,890
This is just like...

1285
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:23,850
Yeah, you just have...

1286
01:15:23,850 --> 01:15:25,689
You just got like a normal life with a dog.

1287
01:15:26,810 --> 01:15:27,289
It's all right.

1288
01:15:29,529 --> 01:15:31,609
Extremely confident older sounding man.

1289
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:36,159
Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

1290
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:40,439
There's a misspelling on that page too.

1291
01:15:41,399 --> 01:15:43,319
Worldwide wrestling resurgence.

1292
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,920
And then...

1293
01:15:47,359 --> 01:15:48,880
Internet independent but insane.

1294
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:51,279
Sewer dwelling gross goblin rat lord.

1295
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:55,800
So now we're completely insane

1296
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:58,119
but completely independent from the internet.

1297
01:15:58,119 --> 01:16:00,279

And then box office record breaking director.

1301
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:20,279
Interesting group of potential people here.

1302
01:16:28,399 --> 01:16:29,359
Thanks for the sub.

1303
01:16:32,109 --> 01:16:34,510
Thanks for the community subs, Liz the squirrel.

1304
01:16:38,829 --> 01:16:41,390
Thanks for the five community subs.

1305
01:16:41,390 --> 01:16:43,390
This is great though, thank you.

1306
01:16:43,949 --> 01:16:46,060
I can't say it.

1307
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:47,579
Just...

1308
01:16:49,119 --> 01:16:50,319
I'm sorry for thinking it.

1309
01:16:50,479 --> 01:16:57,869
Oh, it's Murius.

1310
01:17:00,970 --> 01:17:01,289
Point.

1311
01:17:02,010 --> 01:17:02,569
Point.

1312
01:17:02,569 --> 01:17:04,010
I miss Murius.

1313
01:17:04,010 --> 01:17:05,130
Anybody else miss Murius?

1314
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:09,850
I can't wait till we get to see Murius again.

1315
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:12,350
I love Murius.

1316
01:17:12,350 --> 01:17:13,789
It's like my favorite character.

1317
01:17:18,109 --> 01:17:18,909
Such a cool...

1318
01:17:18,909 --> 01:17:20,510
What a great little friend.

1319
01:17:22,510 --> 01:17:23,229
Black and White 2.

1320
01:17:23,229 --> 01:17:24,430
Is the cow in Black and White 2?

1321
01:17:24,430 --> 01:17:25,949
Otherwise I refuse to play it.

1322
01:17:25,949 --> 01:17:27,149
Even though I own it, it's right behind me.

1323
01:17:27,869 --> 01:17:30,279
Black and White 2 has Murius as a cow.

1324
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:31,800
That's all I needed to hear.

1325
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:35,760
That was so much fun.

1326
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:42,270
This makes me happy.

1327
01:17:42,270 --> 01:17:42,829
It just does.

1328
01:17:44,409 --> 01:17:44,810
Thank you.

1329
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:52,350
Oh, this is a depiction of the transitions.

1330
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:00,119
Okay.

1331
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:05,130
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1332
01:18:05,770 --> 01:18:06,569
This is important.

1333
01:18:07,609 --> 01:18:12,170
You watch this stream on a cell phone vertical.

1334
01:18:12,970 --> 01:18:21,449
That's not enough room.

1335
01:18:22,649 --> 01:18:24,880
Sometimes the chat...

1336
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:26,880
Yeah, that's not enough room though.

1337
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:28,560
Is that enough room?

1338
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:31,239
I'd do that.

1339
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:33,920
I feel like I wouldn't be able to see anything.

1340
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:38,199
That's what I'm doing right now.

1341
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:39,479
Oh, shit.

1342
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:42,590
You have to have chat on...

1343
01:18:43,470 --> 01:18:44,109
Oh, all right.

1344
01:18:45,069 --> 01:18:46,590
Don't they have a thing where you can touch the thing

1345
01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:48,590
and it transparently comes out as chat?

1346
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:49,630
But I guess that's kind of annoying.

1347
01:18:50,430 --> 01:18:52,270
If you can see then, yeah.

1348
01:18:53,149 --> 01:18:55,630
I can imagine if I'm at the gym or if I'm on the toilet.

1349
01:18:56,890 --> 01:18:57,449
Yeah.

1350
01:18:57,449 --> 01:19:00,489
I don't think this person's at the gym or on the toilet though.

1351
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:07,319
We already saw this.

1352
01:19:07,319 --> 01:19:09,319
Fox office record-breaking director.

1353
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,039
Is this a joke from something?

1354
01:19:17,039 --> 01:19:18,560
I don't know this is from exactly.

1355
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:22,840
Somebody cropped my meme.

1356
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:27,720
That way somebody cropped this image from your submission

1357
01:19:28,279 --> 01:19:30,439
and then blew it up and then submitted it.

1358
01:19:34,109 --> 01:19:34,750
That's what happened?

1359
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:41,239
Well, this is nice.

1360
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:42,600
This is very nice.

1361
01:19:43,239 --> 01:19:50,489
But they didn't watermark it.

1362
01:19:50,489 --> 01:19:51,770
Well, we don't know who it was.

1363
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:52,729
It could be anybody.

1364
01:19:52,729 --> 01:19:57,039
It's little Jeremy.

1365
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:00,800
Plant Jeremy.

1366
01:20:01,359 --> 01:20:03,770
What's with the bottom right?

1367
01:20:05,449 --> 01:20:05,689
What?

1368
01:20:05,689 --> 01:20:06,890
Oh, it's just...

1369
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:08,250
It's the signature.

1370
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:10,439
The signature.

1371
01:20:10,439 --> 01:20:10,920
Signature.

1372
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:14,350
Signature.

1373
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:20,729
What do you mean that link?

1374
01:20:23,369 --> 01:20:24,649
What are you linking me right now?

1375
01:20:32,350 --> 01:20:35,130
This is not even real.

1376
01:20:40,699 --> 01:20:41,659
Wait, wait.

1377
01:20:41,659 --> 01:20:42,380
What happened?

1378
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:44,380
Wait, what?

1379
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:47,979
Hold on.

1380
01:20:47,979 --> 01:20:54,539
Wait, this is a dextero article about when I fell back in the chair on New Year's Eve.

1381
01:21:00,909 --> 01:21:03,149
There's an entire article written about this.

1382
01:21:03,149 --> 01:21:07,800
Hold on a second.

1383
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:17,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1384
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,039
I want to read this.

1385
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:32,109
Let's read this.

1386
01:21:32,829 --> 01:21:34,159
Let's read this article.

1387
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:38,300
Okay, here we go.

1388
01:21:41,819 --> 01:21:42,300
This says,

1389
01:21:42,859 --> 01:21:47,310
Twitch streamer forgets how chairs work with a musing fall.

1390
01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:51,979
Twitch streamer Jeremy, Jerma985Elbertson,

1391
01:21:51,979 --> 01:21:56,859
struggled with his chair during his last broadcast of 2019 resulting in an amusing fall.

1392
01:21:57,819 --> 01:22:04,539
I don't get it.

1393
01:22:04,539 --> 01:22:06,510
God!

1394
01:22:06,510 --> 01:22:10,840
Wait, did I just...

1395
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:13,640
This is the ad.

1396
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:15,079
This is an ad.

1397
01:22:15,079 --> 01:22:15,479
This is...

1398
01:22:15,479 --> 01:22:15,800
Okay.

1399
01:22:18,029 --> 01:22:18,430
All right.

1400
01:22:18,430 --> 01:22:22,350
Jerma is a popular variety streamer that covers just about any category of game

1401
01:22:22,350 --> 01:22:25,390
and occasionally dips into IRL in real life content.

1402
01:22:25,470 --> 01:22:29,720
He was streaming a personal best and worst of 2019 on New Year's Eve

1403
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:32,119
when one moment left him retreating into his chair

1404
01:22:32,119 --> 01:22:34,199
and then hilariously tumbling into the floor.

1405
01:22:35,289 --> 01:22:36,729
Why this image?

1406
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:42,119
This is like the Jeremy loves money image.

1407
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,159
Jerma is a variety Twitch streamer known for his entertaining...

1408
01:22:45,159 --> 01:22:46,359
God, dang, that's a nice thing to say.

1409
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:49,000
The American.

1410
01:22:50,199 --> 01:22:50,920
The American.

1411
01:22:52,359 --> 01:22:55,359
I just reached the worst sound of 2009.

1412
01:22:55,359 --> 01:22:56,640
Am I getting to...

1413
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,920
This is a real article.

1414
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,279
I didn't get like fucking edited.

1415
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:01,359
Somebody fucked me up and gave me a fake website, right?

1416
01:23:11,579 --> 01:23:15,020
Hey guys, I'm not seeing enough movement.

1417
01:23:15,579 --> 01:23:18,090
Why did it go over here?

1418
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:19,770
Why did it go over here?

1419
01:23:20,569 --> 01:23:23,689
They want me to watch this video so bad.

1420
01:23:25,659 --> 01:23:26,539
Why did it go over here?

1421
01:23:27,869 --> 01:23:28,109
All right.

1422
01:23:28,109 --> 01:23:30,909
The American just reached the worst sound of 2019 category

1423
01:23:30,909 --> 01:23:32,510
and was not enjoying the winner,

1424
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:36,270
which was the popular anime Ayaya's song,

1425
01:23:36,270 --> 01:23:39,789
something he claims he apologized about for over an hour.

1426
01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:45,449
Jeremy tried to get as far away from the song as possible,

1427
01:23:45,449 --> 01:23:46,409
sinking into his chair.

1428
01:23:46,409 --> 01:23:48,890
However, he quickly realized he'd gone a little too far

1429
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:50,729
as the chair slid away from him

1430
01:23:50,729 --> 01:23:52,569
and he hilariously tumbled to the floor.

1431
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:53,770
Oh shit, he screamed,

1432
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:55,850
which was followed by a loud thud and a short silence

1433
01:23:55,850 --> 01:23:57,369
as he picked himself up off the floor.

1434
01:24:08,189 --> 01:24:08,590
Muted.

1435
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:14,510
Okay.

1436
01:24:15,229 --> 01:24:16,890
Jeremy tried to be cool about it

1437
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:19,210
and played it off as a real life fall joke,

1438
01:24:19,850 --> 01:24:22,590
but his chat was saw right through him,

1439
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:23,710
enjoying the hilarious moment

1440
01:24:23,710 --> 01:24:25,630
while poking a little bit of fun at him.

1441
01:24:25,710 --> 01:24:27,949
And of course, spamming the classic L-U-L-E mode.

1442
01:24:29,609 --> 01:24:30,890
Fall joke.

1443
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:32,409
However, he recovered after a short break

1444
01:24:32,409 --> 01:24:33,289
to regain his composure

1445
01:24:33,289 --> 01:24:35,050
and continued with his personal awards,

1446
01:24:35,050 --> 01:24:36,970
finally moving on to best noise,

1447
01:24:36,970 --> 01:24:41,289
which very well may have been his scream as he fell.

1448
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:43,850
At least this happened at the end of the year

1449
01:24:43,850 --> 01:24:45,770
so he might be able to forget about it

1450
01:24:45,770 --> 01:24:47,130
and get a fresh start in 2020

1451
01:24:47,130 --> 01:24:48,890
as long as he remembers to be more careful.

1452
01:24:56,489 --> 01:24:58,170
What the fuck happened?

1453
01:24:58,170 --> 01:24:59,210
Classic Surgeon says,

1454
01:24:59,210 --> 01:25:01,930
doing this every morning can snap sagging skin back.

1455
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:04,729
Or plastic surgeon takes picture

1456
01:25:04,729 --> 01:25:06,649
of two different people's hands.

1457
01:25:06,649 --> 01:25:16,670
I can't, this is fucking crazy.

1458
01:25:18,510 --> 01:25:19,390
This is crazy.

1459
01:25:21,710 --> 01:25:24,989
The best part is this Jeremy Albertson.

1460
01:25:24,989 --> 01:25:26,270
That's, I love it.

1461
01:25:27,470 --> 01:25:30,029
And this part, a real life fall joke.

1462
01:25:30,909 --> 01:25:32,829
Imagine writing this article and going,

1463
01:25:32,829 --> 01:25:47,760
they use the word hilariously six times.

1464
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,640
It wouldn't be a bathwater of one.

1465
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:53,199
No, no, I'm not reading any more articles.

1466
01:25:57,359 --> 01:25:58,399
What the fuck?

1467
01:25:59,119 --> 01:26:07,500
Hold on, this is all news to me.

1468
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:10,619
Twitch streamer discovers a surprising true origin

1469
01:26:10,619 --> 01:26:12,699
of gamer girl bathwater.

1470
01:26:20,430 --> 01:26:21,149
What?

1471
01:26:21,149 --> 01:26:24,170
Hold on.

1472
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:25,310
Wait, wait, wait, let's look.

1473
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:26,109
I want to look at this first.

1474
01:26:26,670 --> 01:26:30,399
I want to look at this first.

1475
01:26:30,399 --> 01:26:31,119
Hold on.

1476
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:32,319
This is a great image.

1477
01:26:32,319 --> 01:26:34,239
This is of the black and white.

1478
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:41,130
This is black and white.

1479
01:26:41,689 --> 01:26:45,710
There's a not safe for worst picture in the article.

1480
01:26:48,430 --> 01:26:51,100
Yeah, it's all right.

1481
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:52,060
We just need the first part.

1482
01:26:52,619 --> 01:26:56,479
All right, hold on.

1483
01:26:56,479 --> 01:27:01,119
This is so funny.

1484
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:03,550
This is really funny.

1485
01:27:03,550 --> 01:27:05,229
It's really funny for one reason.

1486
01:27:05,869 --> 01:27:13,689
Twitch streamer discovers surprising true origin

1487
01:27:13,689 --> 01:27:14,970
of gamer girl bathwater.

1488
01:27:17,289 --> 01:27:20,569
While the bathwater trend went viral thanks to Belfdelphine,

1489
01:27:21,130 --> 01:27:24,890
Twitch streamer Jeremy German985 Harrington.

1490
01:27:29,229 --> 01:27:31,949
Okay, we've got different last names now.

1491
01:27:32,829 --> 01:27:34,909
May have found the first reference to the stunt

1492
01:27:34,909 --> 01:27:35,949
in popular culture.

1493
01:27:36,909 --> 01:27:37,470
All right.

1494
01:27:37,470 --> 01:27:38,270
What was it?

1495
01:27:38,270 --> 01:27:38,750
What was it?

1496
01:27:47,609 --> 01:27:48,569
Oh, I am fine.

1497
01:27:54,090 --> 01:27:54,649
I'm fine.

1498
01:28:05,289 --> 01:28:06,970
It's not the most flattering statement.

1499
01:28:06,970 --> 01:28:08,409
And it was, oh, yeah.

1500
01:28:08,409 --> 01:28:13,180
We didn't, didn't, didn't you say the Coke gaming?

1501
01:28:13,899 --> 01:28:19,520
Tyler one roast loser donator.

1502
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:20,020
What?

1503
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:21,310
What is this?

1504
01:28:22,170 --> 01:28:24,489
I can't do ads on websites.

1505
01:28:24,489 --> 01:28:25,850
I fucking, they get me.

1506
01:28:28,569 --> 01:28:29,289
All right.

1507
01:28:29,289 --> 01:28:30,810
It's not the most flattering statement.

1508
01:28:30,810 --> 01:28:31,210
It didn't work.

1509
01:28:31,210 --> 01:28:32,170
What's her with girl?

1510
01:28:32,170 --> 01:28:34,569
And the German was cackling in the background.

1511
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:52,600
Twitch chat instantly exploded with references to Belfdelphine

1512
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:55,319
in the gamer girl bathwater stunt too.

1513
01:28:55,319 --> 01:28:57,640
With many saying how topical and relevant this rent.

1514
01:28:58,520 --> 01:28:59,960
This is fucking freaking me out.

1515
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:04,329
What took most people by surprise is now there's...

1516
01:29:04,329 --> 01:29:05,369
How many of these exist?

1517
01:29:17,149 --> 01:29:18,029
They're studying you.

1518
01:29:20,270 --> 01:29:21,710
MonkaS, they're studying you.

1519
01:29:32,939 --> 01:29:36,140
Well, Jerma Elbertson.

1520
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:38,619
Jerma, I gotta have like, you know what?

1521
01:29:38,619 --> 01:29:40,619
That's how you can tell when somebody fucking doesn't even know

1522
01:29:40,619 --> 01:29:41,819
who the fuck you are.

1523
01:29:42,199 --> 01:29:45,640
It's like, you know, but let's throw out some more last names.

1524
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:47,800
See if anybody actually fucking can even get it right.

1525
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:48,279
You know what I mean?

1526
01:29:48,279 --> 01:29:51,239
Like, let's have like, Elbertson obviously is like my real name.

1527
01:29:51,239 --> 01:29:58,239
But let's give some other fake ones like Smith or something, right?

1528
01:29:59,039 --> 01:29:59,539
Smith.

1529
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:03,880
I'm going to start referring to myself as like, as like Jeremy Smith.

1530
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:16,859
Or like Jeremy O'Leary.

1531
01:30:16,859 --> 01:30:18,779
Jeremy O'Leary is another one.

1532
01:30:18,779 --> 01:30:19,659
Jeremy O'Leary.

1533
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:22,859
That's my actual last name is actually O'Leary.

1534
01:30:22,859 --> 01:30:24,380
So I just fucking...

1535
01:30:24,380 --> 01:30:25,100
Whoopsie.

1536
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:29,819
Dick Dastley Richard.

1537
01:30:30,380 --> 01:30:45,130
I've seen the Kotaku one.

1538
01:30:45,130 --> 01:30:46,300
I've already seen it.

1539
01:30:46,859 --> 01:30:49,640
This is great.

1540
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:52,779
I have like, I have like the images over here.

1541
01:30:52,779 --> 01:30:53,579
I gotta get rid of these.

1542
01:30:54,460 --> 01:31:01,159
Dick Dastley Richard.

1543
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:03,550
Looks good.

1544
01:31:04,350 --> 01:31:08,460
I love the finger smoke.

1545
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:11,949
Gregory Hamilton.

1546
01:31:12,829 --> 01:31:15,960
Ooh, you got the treasure.

1547
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:17,800
That's the best part about this image.

1548
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:18,920
You actually got it.

1549
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:25,479
I love that shirt.

1550
01:31:25,479 --> 01:31:26,279
I love that shirt.

1551
01:31:26,279 --> 01:31:26,840
I love that shirt.

1552
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:27,800
This art's really good too.

1553
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:32,619
Good shit.

1554
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:36,350
The gamer?

1555
01:31:36,350 --> 01:31:37,949
Yeah, I saw the carnival one too.

1556
01:31:38,670 --> 01:31:44,039
Look at the glossiness of the eye.

1557
01:31:45,979 --> 01:31:46,619
Oh, I saw...

1558
01:31:46,619 --> 01:31:47,979
Somebody said something about me.

1559
01:31:47,979 --> 01:31:51,020
And I looked at it and I got self-conscious for a minute.

1560
01:31:51,020 --> 01:31:54,829
Somebody said that I look like just sweaty all the time.

1561
01:31:55,470 --> 01:31:57,130
They said I look like...

1562
01:31:57,130 --> 01:32:00,170
They said specifically that I look like the girl from Get Out.

1563
01:32:00,170 --> 01:32:01,130
They said he looks just...

1564
01:32:01,130 --> 01:32:03,050
He looks really like shiny and sweaty all the time.

1565
01:32:03,050 --> 01:32:04,250
He looks like the girl from Get Out.

1566
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:12,760
And I was like, okay.

1567
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:15,020
But I'm just like, do I have like...

1568
01:32:20,479 --> 01:32:21,439
Sludge coating.

1569
01:32:21,439 --> 01:32:21,760
Yeah.

1570
01:32:22,319 --> 01:32:25,840
I just dumped Dewey who said that it was a fucking thread.

1571
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:26,960
I read it.

1572
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:34,840
Your head is constantly rim-lit.

1573
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,760
It's because I got a huge ass eyebrow bone.

1574
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:42,199
Look, I have a big fucking eyebrow bone.

1575
01:32:42,199 --> 01:32:43,560
It comes out like this wide.

1576
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:46,720
But this is fantastic.

1577
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:48,079
This is very, very, very well done.

1578
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:53,199
Which concludes the art portion.

1579
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:55,520
We're going to move on to the video portion now.

1580
01:32:56,829 --> 01:32:57,949
It's Brow Ridge.

1581
01:32:58,590 --> 01:33:01,840
Get your eyebrows threaded.

1582
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:03,199
No, Kim does my eyebrows.

1583
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:04,399
She helps.

1584
01:33:04,399 --> 01:33:06,319
She does like the middle and she cleans up a little bit.

1585
01:33:06,319 --> 01:33:07,920
But I don't want to do too much craziness.

1586
01:33:10,010 --> 01:33:11,210
It's video time.

1587
01:33:11,210 --> 01:33:14,489
We're going to move on to videos.

1588
01:33:14,489 --> 01:33:23,850
Which now we have to turn off the relaxing Animal Crossing music.

1589
01:33:24,890 --> 01:33:34,460
So this first one is titled Jerma's True Shortness Revealed.

1590
01:33:34,460 --> 01:33:36,220
We're going to go off cam for these like always.

1591
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:39,500
Jerma's True Shortness has been revealed.

1592
01:33:40,460 --> 01:33:44,119
He is exactly like you in every way.

1593
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:50,750
Except one-eighth your size.

1594
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:51,710
Oh my god.

1595
01:33:52,829 --> 01:33:53,869
Hi guys.

1596
01:33:54,510 --> 01:33:56,350
My spirit is leaving my body.

1597
01:34:01,369 --> 01:34:02,729
He is exactly like you.

1598
01:34:04,810 --> 01:34:06,510
Except one-eighth your size.

1599
01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:07,390
Oh my god.

1600
01:34:08,670 --> 01:34:09,640
Hi guys.

1601
01:34:10,279 --> 01:34:12,119
My spirit is leaving my body.

1602
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,199
That right there.

1603
01:34:16,199 --> 01:34:17,720
It's so stupid.

1604
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:20,460
It's so fucking dumb.

1605
01:34:23,260 --> 01:34:25,800
All right.

1606
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:26,680
No spoilers.

1607
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:28,119
Well, I change the next one.

1608
01:34:29,159 --> 01:34:33,739
This next one is called World of Warcraft.

1609
01:34:33,739 --> 01:34:35,899
World of JermaCraft episode one.

1610
01:34:36,699 --> 01:34:53,449
My son.

1611
01:34:55,050 --> 01:34:56,329
The day you were born.

1612
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:05,880
What am I doing up here?

1613
01:35:06,279 --> 01:35:40,939
Is this just the please help I'm lost.

1614
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:42,859
My child.

1615
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:55,789
I watched with pride as you grew into a weapon.

1616
01:35:55,789 --> 01:36:01,210
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, please don't do it, please don't do it.

1617
01:36:02,489 --> 01:36:03,979
What?

1618
01:36:03,979 --> 01:36:04,460
Hey.

1619
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:20,670
You will show.

1620
01:36:20,670 --> 01:36:22,029
Was I getting an ad?

1621
01:36:22,029 --> 01:36:27,039
Who has ruled wisdom and strength.

1622
01:36:27,039 --> 01:36:29,180
It's time for you to pay.

1623
01:36:29,180 --> 01:36:36,359
Exercising your great power.

1624
01:36:36,359 --> 01:36:37,239
You're going down.

1625
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:38,520
You're going down.

1626
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:53,720
What?

1627
01:36:53,720 --> 01:37:10,989
The whole trailer.

1628
01:37:10,989 --> 01:37:11,489
What?

1629
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:34,039
Absolutely terrible.

1630
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:36,600
Nothing about this.

1631
01:37:40,119 --> 01:37:46,170
I tell you this.

1632
01:37:47,609 --> 01:37:50,090
For when my days have come to an end.

1633
01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:53,680
You shall be.

1634
01:37:56,159 --> 01:37:57,199
What the fuck?

1635
01:37:59,550 --> 01:38:00,510
He was hearthing.

1636
01:38:01,949 --> 01:38:03,149
Wait, was I actually hearthing?

1637
01:38:05,390 --> 01:38:07,819
What was victory, my son?

1638
01:38:07,819 --> 01:38:09,180
Absolutely terrible.

1639
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:12,680
Nothing about this is good.

1640
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:13,479
Not one thing.

1641
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:21,020
I don't understand what I was doing.

1642
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:23,119
I don't know what that was.

1643
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:25,640
Oh, that was fucking good.

1644
01:38:28,989 --> 01:38:29,789
Teleporting.

1645
01:38:30,989 --> 01:38:33,079
It was an electro dealt.

1646
01:38:36,159 --> 01:38:38,960
This next one is called Stand Eye Catch.

1647
01:38:40,079 --> 01:38:40,880
Whatever that means.

1648
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:41,380
Here it is.

1649
01:38:47,229 --> 01:39:00,220
I'm pissing cat off.

1650
01:39:00,220 --> 01:39:01,579
What? I didn't even do anything.

1651
01:39:02,140 --> 01:39:03,479
This is cool art.

1652
01:39:13,819 --> 01:39:14,460
Oh, it's Joe.

1653
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:15,100
It's Jojo.

1654
01:39:15,100 --> 01:39:15,659
It's Jojo.

1655
01:39:16,539 --> 01:39:17,689
I see.

1656
01:39:17,689 --> 01:39:17,930
All right.

1657
01:39:17,930 --> 01:39:18,810
Well, this is fucking cool.

1658
01:39:18,810 --> 01:39:20,329
It still looks good.

1659
01:39:20,329 --> 01:39:22,250
I got like power in some of these categories.

1660
01:39:23,289 --> 01:39:25,609
Really cool.

1661
01:39:26,409 --> 01:39:34,729
Coming up next is I'm something of a scientist myself.

1662
01:39:38,319 --> 01:39:38,819
Can't wait.

1663
01:39:42,239 --> 01:39:43,520
Hi, Harry.

1664
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:45,220
Harry.

1665
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,239
Been needing this?

1666
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:48,460
Yes, sir.

1667
01:39:49,479 --> 01:39:52,039
Peter, may I introduce my father, Norman Osborn.

1668
01:39:52,039 --> 01:39:53,640
Heard so much about you.

1669
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:55,079
Great honor to meet you, sir.

1670
01:39:55,079 --> 01:39:57,319
Harry tells me you're quite the science whiz.

1671
01:39:57,319 --> 01:40:00,359
You know, I'm something of a scientist myself.

1672
01:40:00,359 --> 01:40:02,680
I read all your research on nanotechnology.

1673
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:03,560
Really brilliant.

1674
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:04,760
And you understood it.

1675
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:06,359
Yes, I wrote a paper on it.

1676
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:08,119
Impressive.

1677
01:40:08,119 --> 01:40:10,039
Your parents must be very proud.

1678
01:40:10,039 --> 01:40:11,239
I live with my animals.

1679
01:40:11,239 --> 01:40:12,119
They are proud.

1680
01:40:12,119 --> 01:40:12,840
Hey, you two.

1681
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:14,520
Let's move.

1682
01:40:15,239 --> 01:40:15,880
Nice to meet you.

1683
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:16,520
Yeah.

1684
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:17,479
Hope to see you again.

1685
01:40:17,479 --> 01:40:17,979
Yeah.

1686
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:22,619
You don't seem so bad.

1687
01:40:22,619 --> 01:40:23,979
Yeah, not if you're a genius.

1688
01:40:23,979 --> 01:40:25,979
I think he wants to adopt you.

1689
01:40:27,979 --> 01:40:29,739
Yes, I wrote a paper on it.

1690
01:40:29,739 --> 01:40:35,689
Deepfaking is so crazy because it even gets the emotion correct.

1691
01:40:37,689 --> 01:40:40,010
Eventually, this technology is going to get so fucked up.

1692
01:40:41,210 --> 01:40:42,090
Look at the guys.

1693
01:40:42,970 --> 01:40:46,569
That's somebody actually focusing their eyes in different directions.

1694
01:40:46,569 --> 01:40:47,210
But I didn't do.

1695
01:40:48,409 --> 01:40:49,529
I live with my aunt and uncle.

1696
01:40:49,529 --> 01:40:50,409
They are proud.

1697
01:40:50,409 --> 01:40:51,130
Hey, you two.

1698
01:40:51,930 --> 01:40:52,569
Right there.

1699
01:40:52,569 --> 01:40:53,130
Even look at that.

1700
01:40:53,850 --> 01:40:54,810
Let's move.

1701
01:40:54,810 --> 01:40:56,170
That's a real emotion somebody's having.

1702
01:40:56,170 --> 01:40:57,289
Nice to meet you.

1703
01:40:57,289 --> 01:40:58,729
See you again.

1704
01:40:58,729 --> 01:41:01,310
This is going to be scary in like 30 fucking years.

1705
01:41:03,930 --> 01:41:05,609
We got another one of those coming up.

1706
01:41:05,609 --> 01:41:08,329
It's from the same movie, if you could guess.

1707
01:41:08,329 --> 01:41:10,729
It's called Out Am I.

1708
01:41:11,770 --> 01:41:13,720
Out Am I.

1709
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:27,130
As of today, Oscorp Industries has surpassed Quest Aerospace.

1710
01:41:27,130 --> 01:41:28,250
That's a little Voldemorty.

1711
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:32,810
As the principal supplier to the United States military.

1712
01:41:32,810 --> 01:41:38,430
In short, ladies and gentlemen of the board, costs are down, revenues are up,

1713
01:41:39,149 --> 01:41:41,470
and our stock has never been higher.

1714
01:41:42,189 --> 01:41:43,470
Wonderful news, Norman.

1715
01:41:43,470 --> 01:41:44,670
Lost it for a second.

1716
01:41:44,670 --> 01:41:46,430
Matter of fact, it's the reason we're selling the company.

1717
01:41:47,739 --> 01:41:48,220
What?

1718
01:41:48,220 --> 01:41:51,500
Yes, Quest Aerospace is recapitalizing in the wake of the bombing.

1719
01:41:52,220 --> 01:41:52,779
Expanding.

1720
01:41:54,159 --> 01:41:56,319
They made a tender offer we can't ignore.

1721
01:41:57,119 --> 01:41:58,479
Why wasn't I told?

1722
01:41:58,479 --> 01:42:02,399
The last thing they want is a power struggle with entrenched management.

1723
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:05,359
The deal is off if you come with it.

1724
01:42:05,359 --> 01:42:08,079
The board expects your resignation in 30 days.

1725
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:10,560
But you can't do this to me.

1726
01:42:14,079 --> 01:42:15,600
I started this company.

1727
01:42:17,449 --> 01:42:19,210
You know how much I sacrificed?

1728
01:42:24,729 --> 01:42:26,010
Please, Norman.

1729
01:42:26,010 --> 01:42:28,220
The board is unanimous.

1730
01:42:29,180 --> 01:42:32,699
We're announcing the sale after the World Unity Festival.

1731
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:34,649
I'm sorry.

1732
01:42:34,649 --> 01:42:37,500
You're out, Norman.

1733
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:43,630
This is actually scary.

1734
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:48,960
Am I?

1735
01:42:53,949 --> 01:42:54,750
Welcome to O-

1736
01:42:57,560 --> 01:42:58,199
Come with it.

1737
01:42:59,479 --> 01:43:01,319
Scariest part is for this, right?

1738
01:43:01,319 --> 01:43:04,600
Like, when it gets close, you can kind of see through the cracks a little.

1739
01:43:05,399 --> 01:43:09,359
But right here, it's-

1740
01:43:10,159 --> 01:43:11,149
Please.

1741
01:43:11,149 --> 01:43:12,829
That guy could be standing there doing this.

1742
01:43:12,829 --> 01:43:13,329
Norman.

1743
01:43:14,029 --> 01:43:16,439
It's still a little fucked up.

1744
01:43:16,439 --> 01:43:17,239
The board is-

1745
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:20,000
The unanimous.

1746
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:20,720
We're an out.

1747
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:21,840
Oh, Max.

1748
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:23,439
Please, Norman.

1749
01:43:23,439 --> 01:43:24,640
How long does it take to render this shit?

1750
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:27,119
The anger part is good, too.

1751
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:33,039
It takes like 50 hours to render this, doesn't it?

1752
01:43:33,039 --> 01:43:34,319
It takes like a week to render this.

1753
01:43:36,239 --> 01:43:37,359
About weeks to render.

1754
01:43:38,569 --> 01:43:39,050
Jesus.

1755
01:43:39,050 --> 01:43:41,960
That's insane.

1756
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:43,399
I started this company.

1757
01:43:45,210 --> 01:43:46,970
You know how much I sacrificed?

1758
01:43:50,430 --> 01:43:51,149
Pretty good work.

1759
01:43:51,149 --> 01:43:51,630
Pretty good-

1760
01:43:51,630 --> 01:43:52,029
Actually, no.

1761
01:43:52,029 --> 01:43:52,909
Pretty good computer.

1762
01:43:53,789 --> 01:43:54,909
Pretty good computer.

1763
01:43:55,390 --> 01:44:00,800
I don't know what you're running this on.

1764
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:04,000
Coming up next is when you show your friend your favorite streamer.

1765
01:44:42,539 --> 01:45:02,649
Dude, get that crap off my computer, bro.

1766
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:26,199
I wonder how many of you guys have gone through the same scenario here.

1767
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:29,319
That's so fucking funny.

1768
01:45:32,479 --> 01:45:35,439
Even the look on his face, too, is like, oh, fuck.

1769
01:45:35,439 --> 01:45:36,800
He doesn't think this is funny.

1770
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:38,000
He thinks this guy sucks.

1771
01:45:39,199 --> 01:45:39,920
And I can tell.

1772
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:41,199
Oh, look.

1773
01:45:41,199 --> 01:45:42,239
Hey, what do you know?

1774
01:45:43,439 --> 01:45:43,939
More.

1775
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:46,800
I'm not even going to introduce it.

1776
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:47,300
Just here.

1777
01:46:01,039 --> 01:46:06,479
Except one eighth your size.

1778
01:46:07,039 --> 01:46:08,079
You motherfucker.

1779
01:46:09,199 --> 01:46:10,399
Breathtaking.

1780
01:46:10,399 --> 01:46:14,460
I shall call him Mini-Me.

1781
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:21,239
Come, Mr. Bigglesworth.

1782
01:46:24,119 --> 01:46:25,880
Mini-Me, are you hungry?

1783
01:46:26,760 --> 01:46:27,960
Something to eat.

1784
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:30,720
Not even a hot pocket.

1785
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:32,079
Jesus, that's too good.

1786
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:35,760
No, no, we don't gnaw on our kitty.

1787
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:36,399
Leave Mi-

1788
01:46:36,399 --> 01:46:36,899
No.

1789
01:46:37,619 --> 01:46:39,619
Leave Mini-Mr. Bigglesworth alone.

1790
01:46:39,619 --> 01:46:40,420
Just love him.

1791
01:46:40,420 --> 01:46:41,060
Stroke him.

1792
01:46:43,390 --> 01:46:50,270
As you know, every diabolical scheme that I've hatched has been thwarted by Austin Powers.

1793
01:46:50,989 --> 01:46:52,510
And why is that, ladies and gentlemen?

1794
01:46:52,510 --> 01:46:53,789
My mother watches this stream.

1795
01:46:53,789 --> 01:46:55,710
She's probably like freaking out right now.

1796
01:46:55,710 --> 01:46:59,460
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1797
01:47:03,869 --> 01:47:04,979
Down.

1798
01:47:04,979 --> 01:47:05,779
Down, Mini-Me.

1799
01:47:10,590 --> 01:47:11,470
Good computer.

1800
01:47:11,470 --> 01:47:12,590
You got a great computer.

1801
01:47:13,550 --> 01:47:16,930
The part that slayed me right here is this part where he takes like the bite.

1802
01:47:17,970 --> 01:47:19,899
It's just so fucking stupid.

1803
01:47:19,899 --> 01:47:20,460
Mini-Me, are you hungry?

1804
01:47:21,340 --> 01:47:22,460
Something to eat.

1805
01:47:22,460 --> 01:47:23,579
Not even a hot pocket.

1806
01:47:25,699 --> 01:47:26,260
An Eggo.

1807
01:47:26,979 --> 01:47:30,050
No, no, we don't gnaw on our kitty.

1808
01:47:30,050 --> 01:47:30,770
This face.

1809
01:47:31,409 --> 01:47:33,619
No, no, no, no.

1810
01:47:36,449 --> 01:47:44,109
Well, good thing we haven't done a community content night in a while,

1811
01:47:44,109 --> 01:47:46,350
considering that it took you two months to make these.

1812
01:47:47,470 --> 01:47:52,510
This movie's fucking hilarious, too.

1813
01:47:53,470 --> 01:48:01,279
This one's called Kira985.

1814
01:48:04,060 --> 01:48:11,619
This is Jojo.

1815
01:48:11,619 --> 01:48:14,130
This is Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

1816
01:48:14,130 --> 01:48:15,539
Is Jojo reference?

1817
01:48:16,739 --> 01:48:34,899
This is called Howling at the Moon.

1818
01:48:48,989 --> 01:49:02,850
We don't need to see that one again.

1819
01:49:03,649 --> 01:49:05,390
We don't need to see that one anymore.

1820
01:49:08,479 --> 01:49:12,159
This is just a quick little two second video, but I thought the rats were cute, so.

1821
01:49:17,220 --> 01:49:19,060
Rats, rats, we are the rats.

1822
01:49:19,060 --> 01:49:20,260
It's infinitely loopable.

1823
01:49:21,300 --> 01:49:23,300
Rats, rats, we are the rats.

1824
01:49:23,300 --> 01:49:25,380
Rats, rats, we are the rats.

1825
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:27,140
Rats, rats, we are the rats.

1826
01:49:27,939 --> 01:49:29,840
I thought it was cute.

1827
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:32,159
It's a draft, I guess, of coming up with some stuff.

1828
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:33,520
Maybe an animation or something.

1829
01:49:34,640 --> 01:49:37,149
You look suspiciously like a furry.

1830
01:49:37,949 --> 01:49:40,000
What are you talking about?

1831
01:49:41,039 --> 01:49:44,460
Now, this is a Who's That Shitty Germa character.

1832
01:49:47,220 --> 01:49:49,069
Who's that Pokemon?

1833
01:49:49,229 --> 01:49:55,869
It's the giant spider that tries to eat and kill you.

1834
01:49:57,069 --> 01:49:57,630
Tricked you.

1835
01:49:57,630 --> 01:50:01,229
It's Germacraft, the series where I play Minecraft.

1836
01:50:01,229 --> 01:50:01,630
Hold on.

1837
01:50:01,630 --> 01:50:03,550
This is going to be a single player Let's Play.

1838
01:50:04,750 --> 01:50:06,859
What's going on?

1839
01:50:06,859 --> 01:50:08,300
Did you hear what they just said?

1840
01:50:08,300 --> 01:50:09,659
I like the anime.

1841
01:50:32,479 --> 01:50:33,039
Oh, God.

1842
01:50:38,619 --> 01:50:44,590
All right, honest opinions.

1843
01:50:44,590 --> 01:50:45,470
What did you guys think?

1844
01:50:46,029 --> 01:50:46,590
Why is that?

1845
01:50:49,390 --> 01:50:50,670
Wait, why did this happen twice?

1846
01:50:59,859 --> 01:51:00,899
That was all over the place.

1847
01:51:02,609 --> 01:51:03,729
All right, honest opinions.

1848
01:51:03,729 --> 01:51:04,529
What did you guys think?

1849
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:06,720
Minus two.

1850
01:51:08,699 --> 01:51:11,760
I mean, that's for you guys to decide, not for me.

1851
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:13,199
Link, link.

1852
01:51:13,199 --> 01:51:15,039
I need this link, link, link, link, link.

1853
01:51:15,039 --> 01:51:15,920
All right, all right, all right.

1854
01:51:20,159 --> 01:51:20,720
Holy shit.

1855
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:30,180
This one is called Patrick Warburton reviews Germa's impressions of his voice.

1856
01:51:32,829 --> 01:51:35,470
I don't want to watch this one.

1857
01:51:35,470 --> 01:51:37,149
I don't want to watch this one.

1858
01:51:37,149 --> 01:51:39,149
Hello, my name is Patrick Warburton.

1859
01:51:39,149 --> 01:51:41,229
I do cartoon voices.

1860
01:51:41,229 --> 01:51:42,270
I do voiceover.

1861
01:51:42,270 --> 01:51:43,949
I do cartoon characters.

1862
01:51:43,949 --> 01:51:47,310
Yo, I'm Family Guy Joe's, you know, he's a professional.

1863
01:51:47,310 --> 01:51:48,670
Peter, I'm a cop.

1864
01:51:48,670 --> 01:51:50,670
So people like to do impressions.

1865
01:51:51,550 --> 01:51:52,430
What the fuck?

1866
01:51:52,430 --> 01:51:53,630
Why does this keep happening?

1867
01:51:53,630 --> 01:51:55,229
Peter, I'm a cop.

1868
01:51:55,229 --> 01:51:57,710
So people like to do impressions.

1869
01:51:57,710 --> 01:52:00,829
And so we're going to look at some today and critique them.

1870
01:52:02,909 --> 01:52:09,810
Hello, Peter.

1871
01:52:09,810 --> 01:52:10,529
Peter.

1872
01:52:10,529 --> 01:52:11,569
Hey, Peter.

1873
01:52:11,569 --> 01:52:12,210
Hello, Peter.

1874
01:52:13,090 --> 01:52:15,229
Or should I say, Peter?

1875
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:26,159
His approach there, I think, is right in tune because he is physicalizing.

1876
01:52:26,159 --> 01:52:29,199
He knows that it's his face that's informing his voice.

1877
01:52:29,439 --> 01:52:31,279
I feel so fancy.

1878
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:34,319
This is my wheelchair.

1879
01:52:34,319 --> 01:52:36,319
There are many like it, but this one is mine.

1880
01:52:36,319 --> 01:52:38,079
I hate this video.

1881
01:52:38,079 --> 01:52:38,720
You guys are in.

1882
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:39,439
This is the end game.

1883
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:43,279
Peter, Peter.

1884
01:52:43,279 --> 01:52:44,399
We're at the end game now, Peter.

1885
01:52:47,250 --> 01:52:48,369
But we're in the end game, Peter.

1886
01:52:51,310 --> 01:52:52,670
My kids always make fun of me.

1887
01:52:52,670 --> 01:52:53,949
I think he does a very good job.

1888
01:52:53,949 --> 01:52:55,310
He's got the timber.

1889
01:52:55,310 --> 01:52:56,350
He brings it down.

1890
01:52:56,350 --> 01:52:59,149
Joe is, Joe's very officious.

1891
01:52:59,710 --> 01:53:00,909
That's where Joe comes from.

1892
01:53:00,909 --> 01:53:02,510
Because he's a police officer.

1893
01:53:02,510 --> 01:53:05,710
So, you know, everything that he says, he's got a little bit of that attitude.

1894
01:53:05,710 --> 01:53:06,989
There's so much more in this video.

1895
01:53:06,989 --> 01:53:08,029
I know what I'm talking about.

1896
01:53:08,029 --> 01:53:12,829
I'm a cop, a good cop, but very fine.

1897
01:53:12,829 --> 01:53:13,710
What the fuck was that?

1898
01:53:13,710 --> 01:53:15,069
Oh, I can't do it.

1899
01:53:15,069 --> 01:53:16,350
What just happened?

1900
01:53:16,350 --> 01:53:17,550
I'm so full.

1901
01:53:17,550 --> 01:53:18,510
What was that?

1902
01:53:18,510 --> 01:53:19,390
No facial hair.

1903
01:53:21,149 --> 01:53:22,510
Peter, it's Stewie Griffin.

1904
01:53:23,710 --> 01:53:34,060
Okay, I like what he does there with the physicality.

1905
01:53:34,060 --> 01:53:37,100
When you do that, that instructs your voice.

1906
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:38,300
Guys have their tricks.

1907
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:42,539
You know, my friend Tom Kenny does this thing.

1908
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:46,319
Ah, it's me, SpongeBob.

1909
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:48,720
You know how to do the SpongeBob laugh?

1910
01:53:48,720 --> 01:53:52,560
Take your finger, put it on like the bottom of your throat and shake up and down.

1911
01:53:53,199 --> 01:53:55,439
And go, ah, the hand technique.

1912
01:53:55,439 --> 01:53:57,920
Ah, ow, ow, fuck, that hurt.

1913
01:53:57,920 --> 01:53:58,399
Don't do that.

1914
01:53:58,399 --> 01:53:58,960
Nobody do that.

1915
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:00,960
Don't do, I just hurt myself.

1916
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:02,079
This poor fella.

1917
01:54:02,640 --> 01:54:09,729
Dr. Schmoinson?

1918
01:54:09,729 --> 01:54:15,600
I believe that is Beater.

1919
01:54:15,600 --> 01:54:16,319
Who is Beater?

1920
01:54:17,890 --> 01:54:19,010
What is Beater?

1921
01:54:19,010 --> 01:54:21,170
That's Joe on acid right there.

1922
01:54:22,130 --> 01:54:23,409
Can I poison him?

1923
01:54:23,409 --> 01:54:23,970
I'm sorry.

1924
01:54:25,250 --> 01:54:29,710
Smooth it out a little bit, but he's got a really nice style and tone there.

1925
01:54:29,710 --> 01:54:31,069
I think he's doing a very fine job.

1926
01:54:31,789 --> 01:54:33,630
That's the only critique I give him.

1927
01:54:33,630 --> 01:54:35,789
And here are some impressions of me.

1928
01:54:36,670 --> 01:54:37,170
What?

1929
01:54:37,869 --> 01:54:39,949
Hey, it's me, Patrick Warburton.

1930
01:54:39,949 --> 01:54:44,670
Cronk, you know, I'm Joe from Family Guy 2 and Beater.

1931
01:54:44,670 --> 01:54:47,550
Hey, Beater, let me tell you something, Beater.

1932
01:54:47,550 --> 01:54:49,069
Is that what we're talking about?

1933
01:54:49,069 --> 01:54:49,569
Cronk?

1934
01:54:52,380 --> 01:54:53,260
Beater.

1935
01:54:53,260 --> 01:54:53,899
That's what he does.

1936
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:59,119
Problem is when you look at impressions of yourself, you're like,

1937
01:54:59,119 --> 01:55:00,800
oh my god, am I really like that?

1938
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:03,039
I mean, I don't know who I look like anymore.

1939
01:55:03,039 --> 01:55:05,199
So that could be me right there.

1940
01:55:06,829 --> 01:55:12,750
Well, I'm Patrick Warburton and that was my critique of some fantastic work.

1941
01:55:12,750 --> 01:55:14,590
I'm so appreciating that.

1942
01:55:14,590 --> 01:55:15,229
God damn it.

1943
01:55:15,229 --> 01:55:16,590
That was fucking disgusting.

1944
01:55:16,590 --> 01:55:19,550
And the next time you see me, you can just kick me right in the nards.

1945
01:55:19,550 --> 01:55:20,050
Peter.

1946
01:55:20,050 --> 01:55:20,550
What?

1947
01:55:20,550 --> 01:55:21,050
Beater.

1948
01:55:22,670 --> 01:55:23,170
Hello?

1949
01:55:28,159 --> 01:55:31,199
And the next time you see me, you can just kick me right in the nards.

1950
01:55:31,199 --> 01:55:31,699
Peter.

1951
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:34,239
Hello?

1952
01:55:34,239 --> 01:55:38,180
I'm losing my mind tonight.

1953
01:55:39,380 --> 01:55:41,619
All right, we got like the real meme ones today.

1954
01:55:43,539 --> 01:55:51,069
This is ultimate trickery.

1955
01:55:51,789 --> 01:55:53,229
Why is it a fucking Egypt?

1956
01:55:53,229 --> 01:55:54,270
What? No, no, no.

1957
01:55:54,270 --> 01:55:55,149
Trick you, it's-

1958
01:55:55,149 --> 01:55:56,109
Super frog.

1959
01:55:56,109 --> 01:55:57,149
Perhaps you don't like it.

1960
01:55:57,149 --> 01:55:57,630
It's got games.

1961
01:55:57,630 --> 01:55:58,510
So much better.

1962
01:55:58,510 --> 01:56:01,069
Well, you have like editing capabilities.

1963
01:56:01,069 --> 01:56:02,510
You know, you can do it if you want.

1964
01:56:02,510 --> 01:56:04,350
Well, I guess I could edit anything there.

1965
01:56:05,949 --> 01:56:10,449
Classic game of jewel wizardry.

1966
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:14,880
If you think you're powerful enough to take on my challenge,

1967
01:56:15,439 --> 01:56:21,119
I'm wearing a fucking red dress and a bathrobe with a Diablo 2 Paladin Scepter.

1968
01:56:21,119 --> 01:56:22,560
Hey, you guys talked about this today.

1969
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:24,560
Are you kidding me?

1970
01:56:25,119 --> 01:56:26,479
That isn't what happened.

1971
01:56:26,479 --> 01:56:27,199
That is not what happened.

1972
01:56:27,199 --> 01:56:28,079
That's exactly what happened.

1973
01:56:28,079 --> 01:56:28,720
What are you talking about?

1974
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:29,760
No, it's not.

1975
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:31,359
You- that was bullshit.

1976
01:56:31,359 --> 01:56:32,560
This is what really happened.

1977
01:56:33,119 --> 01:56:33,840
Oh, hold on a minute.

1978
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:34,800
I'm wearing a super frog.

1979
01:56:35,359 --> 01:56:36,159
Let's quick zoom in.

1980
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:37,680
Okay, you're not-

1981
01:56:37,680 --> 01:56:38,720
I didn't- hold on.

1982
01:56:38,720 --> 01:56:39,680
Okay, you're not liking it.

1983
01:56:39,680 --> 01:56:40,399
It's got candy.

1984
01:56:40,399 --> 01:56:41,520
I'm losing my mind tonight.

1985
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:42,159
Reference.

1986
01:56:42,159 --> 01:56:42,960
That's the line that-

1987
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:44,399
That made me famous.

1988
01:56:44,399 --> 01:56:45,520
That's not what happened.

1989
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:46,960
That's not even close to what happened.

1990
01:56:48,670 --> 01:56:49,630
Every little dog fight.

1991
01:56:50,590 --> 01:56:58,029
What a beautiful working day.

1992
01:56:58,029 --> 01:57:00,270
Your first mission is to destroy a nearby factory.

1993
01:57:00,989 --> 01:57:01,489
Okay.

1994
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:07,920
No, no, no.

1995
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:08,640
There was no truck.

1996
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:09,359
There was no- look.

1997
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:13,439
The one thing that's been in common of this whole thing is

1998
01:57:13,439 --> 01:57:14,079
it's over.

1999
01:57:14,079 --> 01:57:14,399
Yeah.

2000
01:57:14,399 --> 01:57:17,039
That's been a part of all of our flashbacks.

2001
01:57:17,039 --> 01:57:19,039
It has to do with something about it's over.

2002
01:57:19,039 --> 01:57:19,600
I don't know what.

2003
01:57:20,399 --> 01:57:22,180
I'll tell you right now.

2004
01:57:22,180 --> 01:57:23,699
No, I'm gonna put my foot down.

2005
01:57:23,699 --> 01:57:24,199
It's-

2006
01:57:25,069 --> 01:57:26,189
Why is it a fucking Egypt?

2007
01:57:26,189 --> 01:57:26,430
What?

2008
01:57:26,430 --> 01:57:27,229
No, no, no.

2009
01:57:27,229 --> 01:57:27,789
I tricked you.

2010
01:57:27,789 --> 01:57:28,430
It's over.

2011
01:57:28,430 --> 01:57:30,829
What drugs are you on today?

2012
01:57:31,789 --> 01:57:33,020
I can't.

2013
01:57:33,020 --> 01:57:34,859
I can't with these today.

2014
01:57:35,979 --> 01:57:39,649
This is the crack stream.

2015
01:57:39,649 --> 01:57:41,970
This is like the community crack night.

2016
01:57:42,930 --> 01:57:49,899
A fresh slap meets an old classic.

2017
01:57:50,939 --> 01:57:53,920
Oh, you want to fight?

2018
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:54,720
You want to fight?

2019
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:56,000
Don't fucking come at me.

2020
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:56,640
Don't-

2021
01:57:56,640 --> 01:57:57,760
Ow, my butthole.

2022
01:57:58,479 --> 01:58:00,369
For what?

2023
01:58:01,409 --> 01:58:07,149
I've said a lot of words in my life.

2024
01:58:07,710 --> 01:58:08,510
Oh, spoilers.

2025
01:58:09,069 --> 01:58:12,659
This one's called a real statement.

2026
01:58:12,659 --> 01:58:14,100
A real statement.

2027
01:58:14,100 --> 01:58:15,300
It's a statement.

2028
01:58:15,300 --> 01:58:17,979
And if you want to hear what I'm talking about here,

2029
01:58:18,779 --> 01:58:20,939
I'm talking about a real statement.

2030
01:58:20,939 --> 01:58:23,729
A see-through gold play-

2031
01:58:24,850 --> 01:58:26,289
Why is it a fucking Egypt?

2032
01:58:26,289 --> 01:58:26,529
What?

2033
01:58:26,529 --> 01:58:27,250
No, no, no.

2034
01:58:27,250 --> 01:58:27,810
I tricked you.

2035
01:58:27,810 --> 01:58:29,970
It's Egypt and we're both flog pyros.

2036
01:58:34,979 --> 01:58:36,420
These are all different videos, by the way.

2037
01:58:38,659 --> 01:58:41,859
Derma slap best quality 2020 edition.

2038
01:58:42,500 --> 01:58:46,420
I can do that better.

2039
01:58:46,899 --> 01:58:50,289
Oh, you want to fight?

2040
01:58:50,289 --> 01:58:51,250
You want to fight?

2041
01:58:51,250 --> 01:58:52,529
Don't fucking come at me.

2042
01:58:52,529 --> 01:58:53,329
Don't-

2043
01:58:53,329 --> 01:58:53,569
No.

2044
01:58:53,569 --> 01:58:54,130
I tricked you.

2045
01:58:54,130 --> 01:58:56,289
It's Egypt and we're both flog pyros.

2046
01:58:57,010 --> 01:59:08,220
Okay, this one's called flash bang out.

2047
01:59:09,260 --> 01:59:10,539
Fucking goddamn spoilers.

2048
01:59:10,539 --> 01:59:11,020
Whatever.

2049
01:59:11,020 --> 01:59:11,500
I don't care.

2050
01:59:14,220 --> 01:59:15,260
On the ground now!

2051
01:59:15,260 --> 01:59:17,199
We're in trouble now, asshole!

2052
01:59:17,199 --> 01:59:17,920
Flash out!

2053
01:59:19,600 --> 01:59:32,460
Derma fights against the secret undertale boss.

2054
01:59:35,539 --> 01:59:36,899
Secret undertale boss.

2055
01:59:37,619 --> 01:59:38,659
I wonder what it's going to be.

2056
01:59:46,829 --> 01:59:47,310
Not true.

2057
01:59:50,460 --> 01:59:50,939
Is true.

2058
01:59:51,819 --> 01:59:55,779
Two out of three.

2059
01:59:55,779 --> 01:59:59,840
Three out of four.

2060
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:09,649
The giant enemy spider.

2061
02:00:12,529 --> 02:00:26,960
This whole thing, the whole-

2062
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:43,539
Three donations until the end of the stream.

2063
02:00:45,300 --> 02:01:01,619
Okay, okay.

2064
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:08,159
Video games suck.

2065
02:01:08,159 --> 02:01:09,279
Video games suck.

2066
02:01:09,279 --> 02:01:10,399
Video games suck.

2067
02:01:10,399 --> 02:01:11,680
Video games suck.

2068
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:12,560
All video games.

2069
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:13,359
None of them were fun.

2070
02:01:13,359 --> 02:01:14,159
All of them suck.

2071
02:01:14,159 --> 02:01:15,359
All video games suck.

2072
02:01:15,359 --> 02:01:17,359
I'm never playing a video game ever again.

2073
02:01:20,300 --> 02:01:23,300
That was really good.

2074
02:01:24,260 --> 02:01:26,880
That was very, very well done.

2075
02:01:27,680 --> 02:01:29,199
Even have the actual fight too.

2076
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:34,819
No.

2077
02:01:34,819 --> 02:01:35,380
My turn.

2078
02:01:35,380 --> 02:01:36,100
My turn.

2079
02:01:36,100 --> 02:01:36,819
My turn.

2080
02:01:36,819 --> 02:01:37,220
My turn.

2081
02:01:38,180 --> 02:01:40,340
Oh, get Matador!

2082
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:41,539
Did you really just get him?

2083
02:01:42,340 --> 02:01:47,579
Community crack night going strong.

2084
02:01:47,579 --> 02:01:48,140
Spoilers.

2085
02:01:48,140 --> 02:01:48,539
Whatever.

2086
02:01:53,199 --> 02:01:54,880
Yoda got a message from Derma.

2087
02:01:58,579 --> 02:01:59,140
Fuck you.

2088
02:02:02,270 --> 02:02:08,189
That's the whole message.

2089
02:02:09,279 --> 02:02:09,840
Fuck you.

2090
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:25,840
Crazy J.

2091
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:26,640
Crazy J.

2092
02:02:27,680 --> 02:02:28,399
What's going on?

2093
02:02:30,159 --> 02:02:31,039
What's going on?

2094
02:02:35,199 --> 02:02:41,539
360 feet.

2095
02:02:43,859 --> 02:02:48,109
There's a quick little-

2096
02:02:48,109 --> 02:02:50,189
I told you we should have named it like Bites.

2097
02:02:50,189 --> 02:02:50,750
Or Snacks.

2098
02:02:50,750 --> 02:02:52,189
Community content snacks.

2099
02:02:52,189 --> 02:02:52,909
What's going on?

2100
02:02:54,670 --> 02:02:55,550
What's going on?

2101
02:02:56,670 --> 02:03:00,539
These are snacks.

2102
02:03:01,020 --> 02:03:01,579
Oh, this is-

2103
02:03:01,579 --> 02:03:03,180
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

2104
02:03:03,180 --> 02:03:06,140
A snake in the clouds, read by the actual author.

2105
02:03:07,340 --> 02:03:09,220
Look at this.

2106
02:03:09,699 --> 02:03:20,159
A snake in the clouds, written by Jeremy Albertson.

2107
02:03:20,640 --> 02:03:33,890
There once was a snake that did not care.

2108
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:40,369
Got up on a cloud.

2109
02:03:40,369 --> 02:03:41,010
Who's that?

2110
02:03:41,010 --> 02:03:42,210
How did he get there?

2111
02:03:47,119 --> 02:03:51,840
To his friends and family, he did say goodbye.

2112
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:57,470
On a whim, he wanted to try for the sky.

2113
02:03:59,229 --> 02:04:04,850
Soaring and slithering, how high can he go?

2114
02:04:06,989 --> 02:04:08,029
Oh, it was empty.

2115
02:04:08,029 --> 02:04:08,529
Yeah.

2116
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:20,479
This is the point where the streamer gave up.

2117
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:23,119
Turns out you can't-

2118
02:04:23,119 --> 02:04:30,270
But you can do it if you want to, otherwise just fly to the sky.

2119
02:04:31,859 --> 02:04:33,140
Was this the whole story?

2120
02:04:33,939 --> 02:04:34,420
Is it?

2121
02:04:34,420 --> 02:04:36,670
No, there was more story, wasn't there?

2122
02:04:36,670 --> 02:04:41,819
I swear to God, there was like a-

2123
02:04:41,819 --> 02:04:42,939
There was a whole story.

2124
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:50,420
I swear to God, there was like a-

2125
02:04:50,420 --> 02:04:51,060
About how he-

2126
02:04:51,699 --> 02:04:54,100
As friends, he like left all his friends and family and stuff,

2127
02:04:54,100 --> 02:04:55,539
and he became like a-

2128
02:04:55,539 --> 02:04:57,300
Like a super capitalist or something,

2129
02:04:57,300 --> 02:04:58,500
but it was something crazy, right?

2130
02:04:58,500 --> 02:04:58,979
What happened?

2131
02:04:59,939 --> 02:05:03,539
Remember when there was like-

2132
02:05:03,539 --> 02:05:04,260
He like-

2133
02:05:04,260 --> 02:05:06,020
Remember when we were talking about how he had made like

2134
02:05:06,020 --> 02:05:07,699
fucking 500 trillion dollars or something?

2135
02:05:11,550 --> 02:05:12,510
No, I swear to God.

2136
02:05:13,229 --> 02:05:15,859
He's on crack tonight.

2137
02:05:15,859 --> 02:05:17,619
No, no, no, it was like-

2138
02:05:17,619 --> 02:05:18,819
Yeah, look at the key.

2139
02:05:18,819 --> 02:05:20,420
It was all like a gold bar and shit.

2140
02:05:20,420 --> 02:05:21,539
Yeah, no, no, no, they got it.

2141
02:05:22,420 --> 02:05:24,420
Was this like friends looking for him and stuff?

2142
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:30,399
Go, go, go read that stream.

2143
02:05:31,039 --> 02:05:31,439
You'll see.

2144
02:05:32,239 --> 02:05:33,439
I'm not, I'm not on crack tonight.

2145
02:05:33,439 --> 02:05:34,800
This is community crack snacks.

2146
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:36,800
Not, not streamer does crack on stream.

2147
02:05:39,619 --> 02:05:41,300
Giant enemy Muffet.

2148
02:05:41,300 --> 02:05:52,479
The giant enemy spider.

2149
02:06:03,630 --> 02:06:04,829
All right, you guys gotta film me in.

2150
02:06:05,390 --> 02:06:07,069
What happened with the giant enemy spider?

2151
02:06:07,069 --> 02:06:07,949
Why, why does everybody-

2152
02:06:07,949 --> 02:06:08,510
What happened?

2153
02:06:08,510 --> 02:06:09,229
Why did it come back?

2154
02:06:10,350 --> 02:06:12,640
It came back so strong.

2155
02:06:13,439 --> 02:06:16,399
It was just a random thing I did in a video from like 2013.

2156
02:06:17,359 --> 02:06:20,159
And it's been around for a long time.

2157
02:06:20,159 --> 02:06:21,199
It just kind of happened, I guess.

2158
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:23,520
You are trending on Instagram.

2159
02:06:24,560 --> 02:06:27,199
How do you trend on Instagram?

2160
02:06:28,319 --> 02:06:29,760
You can, you can, that's a thing?

2161
02:06:29,760 --> 02:06:30,399
You can do that?

2162
02:06:34,050 --> 02:06:34,930
That's not right.

2163
02:06:35,489 --> 02:06:36,529
It's not right at all.

2164
02:06:37,090 --> 02:06:38,289
Giant enemy tree.

2165
02:06:46,319 --> 02:07:02,270
Activate windows?

2166
02:07:03,310 --> 02:07:03,710
What do you mean?

2167
02:07:03,710 --> 02:07:05,789
Do I not have an activated copy of windows?

2168
02:07:07,789 --> 02:07:08,590
What are you talking about?

2169
02:07:08,590 --> 02:07:09,630
Why did somebody just say that?

2170
02:07:18,739 --> 02:07:27,100
Well, activate windows.

2171
02:07:28,140 --> 02:07:33,420
Dudes run on a, dudes run on a fucking pirated windows copy.

2172
02:07:34,300 --> 02:07:37,630
All right, what's next?

2173
02:07:38,670 --> 02:07:43,649
All right, this is McDonald, McDerma?

2174
02:07:43,729 --> 02:07:46,689
McDerma, do I eat ass?

2175
02:07:46,689 --> 02:07:47,329
Of course I do.

2176
02:07:49,569 --> 02:07:50,369
Piss in my face.

2177
02:07:51,250 --> 02:07:52,210
Immunity crack night.

2178
02:07:52,210 --> 02:07:54,050
Community, community smoke crack snacks.

2179
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:56,720
Do I eat ass?

2180
02:07:57,279 --> 02:07:57,920
Of course I do.

2181
02:08:00,159 --> 02:08:00,960
Piss in my face.

2182
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:05,439
I mean, this is just, this is the, this is the drug stream.

2183
02:08:06,239 --> 02:08:21,039
Shut the fuck up, I'm listening to I Feel Fine.

2184
02:08:23,789 --> 02:08:25,069
Didn't we see this already?

2185
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:46,319
It's sped up or something?

2186
02:09:00,420 --> 02:09:03,859
That's one of those streams where I, when I watch that back, eventually if I ever do,

2187
02:09:04,659 --> 02:09:07,619
there's going to be a lot of weird clips of me fucking moving around with my eyes closed

2188
02:09:07,619 --> 02:09:08,260
and shit.

2189
02:09:08,260 --> 02:09:09,380
I'm certain of it.

2190
02:09:09,939 --> 02:09:11,380
I'm absolutely certain of it.

2191
02:09:11,380 --> 02:09:13,520
What do you care about spoilers?

2192
02:09:14,079 --> 02:09:20,529
This one's called Morbus, Morbius, It's Your Birthday Today.

2193
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:25,359
Michael.

2194
02:09:29,359 --> 02:09:29,680
Michael.

2195
02:09:33,359 --> 02:09:52,699
This one's called, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.

2196
02:09:52,699 --> 02:09:53,579
That's actually the title.

2197
02:09:55,310 --> 02:10:11,649
Oh, smoke crack, smoke crack, crack stream.

2198
02:10:11,649 --> 02:10:12,369
Why is it not here?

2199
02:10:16,859 --> 02:10:17,739
What the fuck?

2200
02:10:17,739 --> 02:10:26,640
Don't smoke crack, it's fucking bad for you.

2201
02:10:27,760 --> 02:10:29,119
Okay, all right, all right.

2202
02:10:29,119 --> 02:10:30,960
I got to get on cam for this because I have to do this.

2203
02:10:30,960 --> 02:10:34,960
I have to do this because I made sure that these were going to be together.

2204
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:38,960
I know I make, when I saw the titles, I'm like, I got to put them in the right spot.

2205
02:10:39,600 --> 02:10:42,800
There's only ones that I really looked at beforehand to know what the fuck they were.

2206
02:10:44,079 --> 02:10:47,680
I am sorry about the next four to five videos.

2207
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:50,960
I'm sorry I'm apologizing because people are going to make me do it anyways.

2208
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:53,119
I'm sorry and I'm not going to say it again.

2209
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:54,319
I'm sorry.

2210
02:11:07,949 --> 02:11:34,850
Oh shit.

2211
02:11:34,850 --> 02:11:35,729
Ow, my butthole.

2212
02:11:38,029 --> 02:11:38,750
What?

2213
02:11:38,750 --> 02:11:39,869
Okay, that was funny.

2214
02:11:41,630 --> 02:11:42,670
All right, that was good, too.

2215
02:11:42,670 --> 02:11:43,229
What's the next?

2216
02:11:54,670 --> 02:12:03,979
Why is it a fucking Egypt?

2217
02:12:03,979 --> 02:12:04,220
What?

2218
02:12:04,220 --> 02:12:04,939
No, no, no.

2219
02:12:04,939 --> 02:12:05,500
I tricked you.

2220
02:12:05,500 --> 02:12:07,340
It's Egypt and we're both flog.

2221
02:12:07,340 --> 02:12:19,460
Jerma's guilty pleasure.

2222
02:12:26,180 --> 02:12:30,640
I think that's it.

2223
02:12:30,640 --> 02:12:31,520
I think that's over.

2224
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:33,039
I think I don't think this anymore.

2225
02:12:33,039 --> 02:12:34,640
I think we just had to get through them.

2226
02:12:35,439 --> 02:12:36,399
We had to get through them.

2227
02:12:38,050 --> 02:12:39,460
All right.

2228
02:12:39,460 --> 02:12:40,979
I already apologized already.

2229
02:12:40,979 --> 02:12:42,100
I said I'm sorry.

2230
02:12:42,100 --> 02:12:45,729
This one is the giant enemy spider, but on Mario Paint.

2231
02:12:47,970 --> 02:12:51,520
I think we've seen this before.

2232
02:13:12,930 --> 02:13:13,810
This is remade.

2233
02:13:15,649 --> 02:13:18,140
It's just Pokemon.

2234
02:13:18,140 --> 02:13:19,500
Yeah, I know, right?

2235
02:13:19,500 --> 02:13:19,819
It is.

2236
02:13:21,100 --> 02:13:22,380
It is just Pokemon.

2237
02:13:22,380 --> 02:13:23,500
So what's what?

2238
02:13:23,500 --> 02:13:31,199
Okay, so it's not the giant enemy spider theme song.

2239
02:13:31,199 --> 02:13:34,079
It's just one of the Pokemon battle themes.

2240
02:13:34,079 --> 02:13:34,399
Yeah.

2241
02:13:34,399 --> 02:13:35,680
So what what's going on?

2242
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:42,319
Don't talk about me.

2243
02:13:42,319 --> 02:13:44,319
I thought I'm just doing the Pokemon song.

2244
02:13:52,239 --> 02:13:54,159
That's not the giant enemy spider theme song.

2245
02:13:57,119 --> 02:13:58,800
I stole that from Pokemon.

2246
02:13:58,800 --> 02:13:59,760
I stole it.

2247
02:14:02,300 --> 02:14:12,369
This actually is really good, though.

2248
02:14:13,170 --> 02:14:16,750
Make an original right now.

2249
02:14:16,750 --> 02:14:17,069
I did.

2250
02:14:17,069 --> 02:14:18,350
It was the giant enemy tree.

2251
02:14:22,699 --> 02:14:23,500
I did that already.

2252
02:14:37,840 --> 02:14:39,039
Second one is never as good.

2253
02:14:39,039 --> 02:14:40,159
This is really good, though.

2254
02:14:40,159 --> 02:14:40,640
Nice work.

2255
02:14:40,640 --> 02:14:41,359
Let's link this one.

2256
02:14:42,560 --> 02:14:45,300
How do I remember it?

2257
02:14:45,300 --> 02:14:46,819
Because it's three notes.

2258
02:14:47,779 --> 02:14:50,260
It's not hard for me to remember the three notes.

2259
02:14:51,300 --> 02:14:52,220
All right.

2260
02:14:52,220 --> 02:14:54,939
This one's called, you know, I'm just going to let you figure it out.

2261
02:15:06,909 --> 02:15:08,909
Yes, we sense.

2262
02:15:13,630 --> 02:15:15,310
The giant enemy spider.

2263
02:15:17,789 --> 02:15:26,180
We must stop him now.

2264
02:15:26,180 --> 02:15:28,020
Yes, now we have no choice.

2265
02:15:29,779 --> 02:15:32,590
Okay, for a second, the reason why I scrolled over here

2266
02:15:32,590 --> 02:15:34,989
is because I thought it was another unactivated windows.

2267
02:15:35,789 --> 02:15:37,789
I was like, damn, you guys don't have windows.

2268
02:15:38,750 --> 02:15:50,609
This one's called waste of 14 seconds.

2269
02:15:52,930 --> 02:15:54,369
At least they're honest about it, I guess.

2270
02:15:55,250 --> 02:15:55,750
Yeah.

2271
02:15:56,850 --> 02:16:02,859
See, a lot of people didn't know that there was a boss battle in this.

2272
02:16:04,029 --> 02:16:04,829
The giant.

2273
02:16:04,829 --> 02:16:06,270
Oh, oh, farting monkey.

2274
02:16:10,029 --> 02:16:11,630
Oh, I hate dog.

2275
02:16:11,630 --> 02:16:12,189
All right.

2276
02:16:12,189 --> 02:16:12,510
All right.

2277
02:16:12,510 --> 02:16:12,989
You wait.

2278
02:16:12,989 --> 02:16:14,109
Well, that was a waste of time.

2279
02:16:14,109 --> 02:16:15,069
That was a waste of time.

2280
02:16:15,069 --> 02:16:16,350
That was a waste.

2281
02:16:16,350 --> 02:16:17,489
All right.

2282
02:16:17,489 --> 02:16:18,210
Get it off.

2283
02:16:18,210 --> 02:16:22,779
I mean, Nintendo is here.

2284
02:16:24,060 --> 02:16:24,380
What do you mean?

2285
02:16:24,380 --> 02:16:25,180
Nintendo is here.

2286
02:16:32,270 --> 02:16:32,989
Nintendo is in.

2287
02:16:32,989 --> 02:16:34,670
Nintendo is hanging out in the stream.

2288
02:16:34,670 --> 02:16:35,309
No, they're not.

2289
02:16:36,270 --> 02:16:38,610
Where's the viewer list?

2290
02:16:49,899 --> 02:16:50,940
That's a lie.

2291
02:16:50,940 --> 02:16:51,899
Nintendo is not here.

2292
02:16:53,020 --> 02:16:57,889
Give me the link now.

2293
02:16:57,889 --> 02:16:58,129
All right.

2294
02:16:59,649 --> 02:17:01,579
They actually were.

2295
02:17:01,579 --> 02:17:03,100
No, they were not.

2296
02:17:03,100 --> 02:17:03,979
They were not.

2297
02:17:05,340 --> 02:17:10,700
The official at Nintendo Twitch channel guys only logs in to stream directs.

2298
02:17:10,700 --> 02:17:13,899
They don't hang out and people stream and like gift a thousand subs.

2299
02:17:14,540 --> 02:17:15,760
You know what I mean?

2300
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:18,239
It's not like here comes Nintendo with like a huge.

2301
02:17:18,239 --> 02:17:19,600
I got like millions of dollars.

2302
02:17:20,559 --> 02:17:21,739
They were not.

2303
02:17:21,739 --> 02:17:22,139
They were.

2304
02:17:22,139 --> 02:17:22,700
They were not here.

2305
02:17:22,700 --> 02:17:23,180
No way.

2306
02:17:23,180 --> 02:17:24,059
I don't believe it.

2307
02:17:24,059 --> 02:17:26,940
When were they here?

2308
02:17:27,500 --> 02:17:29,889
What did you say?

2309
02:17:29,889 --> 02:17:30,290
You idiot.

2310
02:17:30,290 --> 02:17:30,930
What are you talking about?

2311
02:17:30,930 --> 02:17:31,569
They were here.

2312
02:17:31,569 --> 02:17:32,450
They were actually here.

2313
02:17:32,450 --> 02:17:39,899
Somebody prove it like three minutes ago.

2314
02:17:40,540 --> 02:17:41,250
Hold on.

2315
02:17:42,370 --> 02:17:45,329
You mean to tell me that Nintendo actually Nintendo account was here.

2316
02:17:46,139 --> 02:17:48,219
And when I write, when I clicked this button.

2317
02:17:48,219 --> 02:17:52,270
See, a lot of people didn't know that there was a boss battle of this.

2318
02:17:53,469 --> 02:17:55,709
The giant farting monkey.

2319
02:17:57,549 --> 02:17:59,790
They left because of that.

2320
02:18:00,430 --> 02:18:01,709
Oh my fucking God.

2321
02:18:02,350 --> 02:18:02,829
What do you mean?

2322
02:18:02,829 --> 02:18:03,309
His proof.

2323
02:18:03,309 --> 02:18:04,030
This could be doctored.

2324
02:18:04,030 --> 02:18:05,709
You could have you could have doctored this up.

2325
02:18:06,750 --> 02:18:16,239
It could be doctored.

2326
02:18:17,040 --> 02:18:20,139
It's real.

2327
02:18:26,909 --> 02:18:27,629
Hi, Nintendo.

2328
02:18:29,149 --> 02:18:29,950
Hi, Nintendo.

2329
02:18:30,829 --> 02:18:32,030
German985 here.

2330
02:18:33,149 --> 02:18:35,709
Hope you're not browsing around channels to sue.

2331
02:18:39,489 --> 02:18:40,690
Why else would you be here?

2332
02:18:42,219 --> 02:18:56,079
He stole the team that the.

2333
02:18:56,079 --> 02:18:57,440
Oh, actually, this is kind of fucking cool.

2334
02:18:58,479 --> 02:19:00,260
Take a look at this.

2335
02:19:02,799 --> 02:19:04,479
The giant enemy spider.

2336
02:19:06,780 --> 02:19:14,989
That's pretty sick.

2337
02:19:15,469 --> 02:19:16,829
That was really good.

2338
02:19:16,829 --> 02:19:18,510
The giant enemy spider.

2339
02:19:20,909 --> 02:19:24,319
Just want to make this really clear.

2340
02:19:25,200 --> 02:19:26,420
Huge Nintendo fan.

2341

All of them.

2344
02:19:30,819 --> 02:19:33,379
I'm the number one Nintendo Labo streamer on Twitch.

2345
02:19:33,379 --> 02:19:34,020
That's naughty.

2346
02:19:34,020 --> 02:19:34,579
That's not a joke.

2347
02:19:34,579 --> 02:19:35,540
That is a fact.

2348
02:19:35,540 --> 02:19:36,659
That is an actual fact.

2349
02:19:37,940 --> 02:19:39,540
So I mean, I love this company.

2350
02:19:40,340 --> 02:19:51,139

02:19:51,139 --> 02:19:53,409
All right.

2352
02:19:53,409 --> 02:19:54,450
We're getting close to the end here.

2353
02:19:54,450 --> 02:19:56,690
We have more.

2354
02:19:56,690 --> 02:19:57,809
I knew we were going to get these.

2355
02:19:57,809 --> 02:19:58,610
So here we go.

2356
02:19:59,090 --> 02:20:00,770
This is called German when nobody's looking.

02:20:00,770 --> 02:20:02,290
We saw a couple of these already during the.

2358
02:20:03,090 --> 02:20:03,969
You look pissed off.

2359
02:20:03,969 --> 02:20:04,209

2360
02:20:05,329 --> 02:20:23,920
We already saw this one.

2361
02:20:23,920 --> 02:20:25,520
Yeah, it's worth a second look.

2362
02:20:33,840 --> 02:20:34,319
Psycho.

2363
02:20:35,600 --> 02:20:36,879

At Nintendo copyright, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Hold on. I don't talk over this part

2458
02:35:19,219 --> 02:35:23,299
Not a real lawyer. It was good. And

2459
02:35:25,290 --> 02:35:27,290
finally finally

2460
02:35:27,969 --> 02:35:29,969
last thing of the night we have

2461
02:35:30,930 --> 02:35:33,930
Jermis spider undertale joke dot wave

2462
02:35:34,450 --> 02:35:44,670

2465
02:36:46,690 --> 02:36:50,340
Fuck yeah, fuck. Yeah

2466
02:36:50,540 --> 02:36:53,340
Good stuff good stuff

2467
02:36:55,049 --> 02:36:57,290

Good cider give us the link you want the link to that one. Yeah, they're all available in the in that discord channel

2469
02:37:15,379 --> 02:37:22,610
What's what people what's going on?

2470
02:37:23,129 --> 02:37:24,649
year of the rat

2471
02:37:24,649 --> 02:37:27,180
What did I not?

2472
02:37:27,180 --> 02:37:33,350
When was this uploaded? Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's why. Yeah, so

2473
02:37:34,590 --> 02:37:38,469
The reason why I didn't put this one in is because this is as of last week

2474
02:37:38,469 --> 02:37:44,170
And I figured that we can have obviously we'll do this again in February

2475
02:37:44,889 --> 02:37:47,290
Watch it now. Well that this is not fair skipping

2476
02:37:49,049 --> 02:37:59,959
30 other videos. That's not fair now now now now now now now now now now

2477
02:38:00,440 --> 02:38:07,899
Now the next community content night is not gonna be three months from now. Don't worry

2478
02:38:08,459 --> 02:38:15,719
The really the reasoning to do this up until about like the sick 15 16 to 18th or so

2479
02:38:16,120 --> 02:38:20,200
Is in the first or second week of February, I can actually do another one on time

2480
02:38:21,239 --> 02:38:28,899
Make an exception. It's the year of the rat. I think an exception is the year of the rat. It's a year of the rat

2481
02:38:29,700 --> 02:38:38,149
All right. All right. Fine. Fine. If ever ever. All right. All right. All right

2482
02:38:38,950 --> 02:38:41,510
All right, you're gonna be shut down buddy

2483
02:38:42,229 --> 02:38:48,329
There's also another video that I want to show too that we'll put in the next one as well

2484
02:38:49,370 --> 02:38:53,989
That was longer than five minutes, but

2485
02:38:53,989 --> 02:38:56,229
We're gonna make an exception for it. So

2486
02:38:57,110 --> 02:39:06,540
But yeah, remember that if people are like, whoa, what happened? What about I uploaded something to january 23rd?

2487
02:39:07,500 --> 02:39:13,659
That's because it's as of like a week ago or so. So all these things are as of like the weekend of the 18th

2488
02:39:14,620 --> 02:39:16,059
17 18

2489
02:39:16,059 --> 02:39:18,700
Hey, what are you doing? What are you doing under here?

2490
02:39:19,500 --> 02:39:22,940
Just like skid the shit out of it. Hey, you just like ran under my legs

2492
02:39:27,899 --> 02:39:30,700
He's like, hey pay attention to me. You are so hyper right now

2493
02:39:33,180 --> 02:39:37,299
He's like a million miles per hour. What are you doing? What are you with you?

02:39:38,420 --> 02:39:40,420
Are you hungry? I think he's hungry

2495
02:39:40,979 --> 02:39:44,569
You just went outside and now you're hungry

2496
02:39:45,690 --> 02:39:47,690
Hold on. I gotta feed him

2497
02:39:47,690 --> 02:39:53,579
We're pretty much at the end of the stream. So

2498
02:39:54,780 --> 02:40:01,739
He's starving or something. You just ate like you what do you want? He's like please I need you to do something

2499
02:40:02,139 --> 02:40:06,860
What do you want? He's like, please I need you to do this. It's like glassy. What happened?

2500
02:40:07,500 --> 02:40:09,260
Somebody fall down the well

Hold on. I'll be right back

2503

Hopefully shit. He's back and he started playing the video without us

2504
02:45:01,850 --> 02:45:18,510
No, here we go. This is year of the rat and this will be the end of the stream

2505
02:45:20,329 --> 02:45:28,059
What are you doing? What are you linking?

02:45:28,139 --> 02:45:30,889

02:45:50,870 --> 02:45:53,370

Wait, what is this? Is this correct? This feels like why is this somebody's fucking why is it?

2530
02:48:48,790 --> 02:48:51,129
without further ado

2531
02:48:52,659 --> 02:48:54,659
We are going to

2532
02:48:54,979 --> 02:48:56,979
Uh, look at this card

2533
02:48:58,299 --> 02:49:02,540
Look at this card. So I went when I got it linked originally it was like somebody's desktop

2534
02:49:02,540 --> 02:49:04,299
But I was like, wait, why am I on someone's deck?

2535
02:49:04,299 --> 02:49:15,500
I was like sharing somebody's computer screen and it freaked me out. All right, let me uh, let's get this in the right spot

2536
02:49:15,500 --> 02:49:17,500

2537
02:49:17,739 --> 02:49:21,260
Wait, wait, wait, wait. I gotta go back

2538
02:49:21,399 --> 02:49:23,450
Anti-spoiler slide

2539
02:49:23,450 --> 02:49:25,610
This card is 250 slides long

2540
02:49:28,260 --> 02:49:30,260
Holy shit. That's a lot of slides

2541
02:49:30,659 --> 02:49:36,059

2542
02:49:36,059 --> 02:49:46,459
Holy fuck. Oh my god. I'm gonna need a whole stream just for this

2543
02:49:47,180 --> 02:49:53,190

02:50:17,319 --> 02:50:19,399
for the purpose of not

2548
02:50:19,399 --> 02:50:21,399
Just blowing through something. That's this

2549
02:50:22,360 --> 02:50:26,280
This fucking nice for a community to do to somebody I don't just want to blow through this

2550
02:50:28,739 --> 02:50:30,739
So what we're gonna do

2551
02:50:30,819 --> 02:50:32,819
Is I have a plan to finish

2552
02:50:33,860 --> 02:50:35,860
Well, uh, let's let's go over some, uh

2553
02:50:36,100 --> 02:50:38,100
Some stuff here really briefly

2554
02:50:38,180 --> 02:50:42,739
So as of tomorrow i'm not streaming tomorrow because i'm doing some medical shit. I got some stuff to do

2555
02:50:42,979 --> 02:50:46,819
I have a doctor's appointment that is very very important. We have a lot of stuff to talk about

2556
02:50:47,540 --> 02:50:49,540
but on tuesday

2557
02:50:50,180 --> 02:50:52,180
I have a five day plan

2558
02:50:52,979 --> 02:50:54,659
One of those days

2559
02:50:54,659 --> 02:51:00,020
I'm going to try to kill diablo in hardcore. So whatever day that is

2560
02:51:00,979 --> 02:51:06,180
That stream that that playing d2 against diablo hardcore might be like 20 minutes long

2561
02:51:07,059 --> 02:51:12,979
If I in the for some reason beat diablo, I it's going to be tricky

2562
02:51:14,729 --> 02:51:18,409
But one of those nights over the five days in a row that i'm going to stream we will do this

2563
02:51:19,690 --> 02:51:21,690
I just want to give it um

2564
02:51:21,690 --> 02:51:25,129
I want to give it time that it deserves. I don't just want to skip it and be like, oh, yeah

2565
02:51:25,129 --> 02:51:27,129
It's been six and a half hours. All right

2566
02:51:27,530 --> 02:51:31,770
Next next next. Thank you. Next. Thank you. Cool. Cool. Cool. I'd like to put time into it

2567
02:51:32,329 --> 02:51:35,719
So we'll do it one of those days

2568
02:51:36,040 --> 02:51:38,040
Uh in the upcoming five days in a row

2569
02:51:40,629 --> 02:51:43,270
Just read my slide. Why would I do that?

2570
02:51:47,139 --> 02:51:49,139
Yeah, well I have to link now

2571
02:51:49,139 --> 02:51:51,139
So i'll just i'll have this bookmarked

2572
02:51:52,549 --> 02:51:57,350
But to think that somebody made me a card with almost 300 slides on it

2573
02:51:59,059 --> 02:52:03,540
That's I that's I don't even know what to say. Uh, we'll touch upon it when we go over it, but

2574
02:52:04,180 --> 02:52:06,180
There's 282 slides

2575
02:52:07,219 --> 02:52:08,659
Oh my goodness

2576
02:52:08,659 --> 02:52:10,659
Am I doing fine health wise?

2577
02:52:11,219 --> 02:52:12,579
Yes

2578
02:52:12,579 --> 02:52:14,579
Yes, it's just been a pain in the ass

2579
02:52:14,979 --> 02:52:21,270
And I will have every answer that i'm looking for as of tomorrow because I had a

2580
02:52:22,069 --> 02:52:24,549
very very very extensive mri

2581
02:52:25,350 --> 02:52:28,309
Of my entire chest and abdomen and shit. So it

2582
02:52:28,950 --> 02:52:33,350
They know that I I don't know. I tomorrow i'm getting the results and i'm going to figure out what the hell is going on

2583
02:52:36,950 --> 02:52:41,110
And then from there, I might have to get an injection into my rib cage. I don't know. We'll see

2584
02:52:43,879 --> 02:52:46,440
You're all right. Well, then give us the card back. Hey

2585
02:52:47,159 --> 02:52:49,159
No, it's my card now

2586
02:52:49,860 --> 02:52:52,100
It's mine. Holy shit

2587
02:52:52,899 --> 02:52:59,959
But that'll conclude the uh kind of double feature here. We did some community content stuff wanted to catch up more into january

2588
02:53:00,979 --> 02:53:05,719

02:53:31,850 --> 02:53:34,020
But I will see you guys on tuesday

2597
02:53:34,739 --> 02:53:36,739

2614
02:54:41,030 --> 02:54:43,670

Uh, I hope you enjoyed the beans. They're good

2617

Oh the breakfast beans. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they're good. They're really good

Not a wolf man. Thanks for 400 bits

2626
02:55:19,270 --> 02:55:23,350
Germa haven't been able to catch a stream in a while and I wanted to ask if you played majesty yet

2627
02:55:23,829 --> 02:55:29,030
I bugged you a bunch about it during the sleeping dog streams and I wanted an update keep being cool. I did

2628
02:55:29,829 --> 02:55:32,090
I played the majesty hd version

2629
02:55:32,969 --> 02:55:36,629
Did a whole stream on it. Yeah

2630
02:55:36,629 --> 02:55:37,930
It was fun

2631
02:55:37,930 --> 02:55:46,420
I did play it though go search through the archives through the archives. You're fine. It's a good game

2632
02:55:49,959 --> 02:55:53,079
Moving on we had 300 bits from ozals. They said dear jeremy

2633
02:55:53,879 --> 02:55:59,399
My boyfriend broke up with me after a one year of dating my weekend's been shit and i've been depressed like never before

2634
02:55:59,879 --> 02:56:02,760
My streams have been helping me cope so I can at least thank you for that

2635
02:56:03,239 --> 02:56:08,280
This has come with the worst time considering. I have my act coming up in a month and some of the hardest classes this semester

2636
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:10,600
Do you have any advice?

2637
02:56:10,600 --> 02:56:14,700
Thanks for being awesome

2638
02:56:14,700 --> 02:56:17,979
Well, uh in relationship well relationship wise

2639
02:56:19,180 --> 02:56:21,180
I don't have very much good advice to be honest

2640
02:56:21,819 --> 02:56:26,260
Because I I didn't I haven't really been part of too many relationships

2641
02:56:26,899 --> 02:56:31,450
And my tinder was kind of a joke. So I don't really have very many

2642
02:56:32,010 --> 02:56:34,329
much in good relationship advice to be honest with you

2643
02:56:35,450 --> 02:56:36,729
but

2644
02:56:36,729 --> 02:56:41,719
I'm, not sure how young you are. But if you're taking your act i'm assuming that you're fairly young

2645
02:56:44,020 --> 02:56:47,239
So don't worry. There's still plenty of people to meet

2646
02:56:48,040 --> 02:56:51,100
how many people to talk to

2647
02:56:51,100 --> 02:56:51,979
and

2648
02:56:51,979 --> 02:56:54,950
Hope you do well on that test

2649
02:56:54,950 --> 02:56:56,950
Wrap it up jeremy. What?

2650
02:56:57,110 --> 02:56:59,319
What?

2651
02:56:59,319 --> 02:57:01,340
Hey

2652
02:57:01,340 --> 02:57:03,799
Wrap it up

2653
02:57:03,799 --> 02:57:10,520
I just started

2654
02:57:11,860 --> 02:57:13,559
But anyways

2655
02:57:13,559 --> 02:57:14,520
uh

2656
02:57:14,520 --> 02:57:17,780
I wish your luck on your on your act's

2657
02:57:21,059 --> 02:57:23,059
It's not a joke. Those things are hard

2658
02:57:24,280 --> 02:57:26,920
And in my opinion, they're kind of stupid

2659
02:57:27,879 --> 02:57:29,879
Because why would we put so much on?

2660
02:57:30,440 --> 02:57:32,739
one test

2661
02:57:32,739 --> 02:57:34,899
It's just like come on like this. Give me a break

2662
02:57:37,930 --> 02:57:41,290
sat's act's it's just like come on it would really have to do that

2663
02:57:42,870 --> 02:57:48,790
Really have to make everybody's entire college and high school careers alive is based around one exam

2664
02:57:52,659 --> 02:57:58,520
Tests of bullshit in the first place. Can I just say it's not an indicator of how fucking much you know

2665
02:58:01,559 --> 02:58:07,159
Here comes another school rant. No, no, that's all I gotta say. That's it. That's all I gotta say

2666
02:58:07,799 --> 02:58:13,340
But I wish you luck and i'm really sorry to hear that you've uh had some relationship

2667
02:58:13,979 --> 02:58:16,459
issues here

2668
02:58:16,459 --> 02:58:20,100
Good luck on the test

2669
02:58:20,100 --> 02:58:22,809
I'm sure you'll do fine

2670
02:58:22,809 --> 02:58:26,889
Hey black bear, thanks for the 300 bits. I'm glad to see you streaming this game. The devs are really nice

2671
02:58:26,889 --> 02:58:33,049
I met them in a stream. I was moderating when this game sequel came out and it's an all ages game. Not a baby game

2672
02:58:34,569 --> 02:58:38,889
I don't I I thought it was very good too. It was very charming. It was really fun. The characters are really cute

2673
02:58:39,530 --> 02:58:44,889
It's good. I just was asking in the very beginning if it was like a putt putt game. I didn't know

2674
02:58:44,969 --> 02:58:46,969
I just was asking the question. That's it

2675
02:58:47,610 --> 02:58:54,700
I just wanted to know

2676
02:58:54,700 --> 02:58:56,860
But it wasn't it was just fun. It was cute

2677
02:58:58,469 --> 02:59:01,110
Become as god thanks for the five community subs god

Uh sparkle quest. Thanks for 300 bits

2680
02:59:08,409 --> 02:59:14,620
German, my name is illa. I've been a huge fan of yours for years. I love this game frogs are the best

2681
02:59:14,620 --> 02:59:19,739
I found out I have costochondritis and heard from a friend that you do too. Hope you feel better

2682
02:59:21,270 --> 02:59:23,270
That's the theory we have not

2683
02:59:23,350 --> 02:59:24,389
stamped

2684
02:59:24,389 --> 02:59:27,110
The actual diagnosis on that we'll probably figure that out tomorrow

2685
02:59:27,750 --> 02:59:30,709
Tomorrow is the day when I find out if that's what really is going on

2686
02:59:31,350 --> 02:59:35,770
But it seems like that's probably what it is and it's a pain in the ass

2687
02:59:36,569 --> 02:59:40,870
Thanks for the 300 bits. Thanks for watching frogs are the best

2688
02:59:41,750 --> 02:59:44,219
Yes

2689
02:59:44,219 --> 02:59:51,659
Rock writing thanks for the 500 bits. Your first bernie sanders voice was veering into dan ackroyd crystal skull vodka promo video territory

2690
02:59:52,700 --> 03:00:00,700
I need to hear this. I'm dan ackroyd since childhood

2691
03:00:00,780 --> 03:00:07,020
I have been fascinated with the invisible world a world which can help us get through life if we know how to draw upon its power

2692
03:00:07,579 --> 03:00:14,059
a world serving positive projections wherein you use your own personal mental and spiritual abilities to believe

2693
03:00:14,540 --> 03:00:18,059
And subsequently make true the things that you want to happen for yourself

2694
03:00:18,459 --> 03:00:24,059
Some landscape painter john alexander whose most recent exhibitions include showings at the american wing

2695
03:00:24,379 --> 03:00:27,420
I've had the crystal skull vodka before I actually kind of like it

2696
03:00:28,379 --> 03:00:36,260
I thought it was pretty good. I've had it before then it's in a crystal. What what i've had it. It's good

2697
03:00:37,379 --> 03:00:39,139
What's wrong with it?

2698
03:00:39,139 --> 03:00:42,100
Just because it's in a crystal skull doesn't mean it's not good

2699
03:00:42,739 --> 03:00:49,180
I've heard it's good vodka. It I mean it tastes good. It tastes fine. It's okay

2700
03:00:51,260 --> 03:00:52,860
It's a scam

2701
03:00:52,860 --> 03:00:58,659
But how can it how can how can vodka be a scam if it's just vodka it was filtered through

2702
03:01:03,620 --> 03:01:05,620
No vodka tastes good

2703
03:01:06,020 --> 03:01:08,899
Well, you start to like vodka when it's one of the only things you can drink

2704
03:01:09,620 --> 03:01:13,459
Because it's the most basic benign alcohol you could possibly consume

2705
03:01:14,020 --> 03:01:16,020
So yeah, I have i've drank it

2706
03:01:16,579 --> 03:01:26,280
Alcohol is a scam

2707
03:01:26,280 --> 03:01:27,559
I mean, that's a

2708
03:01:27,559 --> 03:01:33,059
Whatever. I also stay happy stay healthy. Happy new year. Happy new year to you ruck

2711
03:01:49,510 --> 03:01:52,069

2712
03:01:52,149 --> 03:01:55,180

Hey germa, i've been watching you for a couple years now, but being from southern texas

2716
03:02:10,459 --> 03:02:15,180
Being from southern texas. My dad wasn't too keen on me getting my yankee influence

2717
03:02:15,819 --> 03:02:20,459
I was able to convince him that you're nothing more than a northern sympathizer, but he was still suspicious

2718
03:02:21,020 --> 03:02:26,540
Somehow my dad found out and went to the nearby saloon trying to drink the disappointment out. He came home drunk and started. All right

Um, all right. There's got you got to give me a little bit of slack here when somebody like rp monologues being like

Hey, thank you

2729
03:03:15,379 --> 03:03:27,899

2730
03:03:28,940 --> 03:03:30,940

And put porn serial numbers in that's five. It's fifty dollars you spent

That's fifty dollars

2865
03:13:31,819 --> 03:13:35,180
Fifty that's a lot of money. You could have done it with

2866
03:13:36,120 --> 03:13:38,440
250 man

2867
03:13:38,440 --> 03:13:42,760

All right, all right

2880
03:14:40,409 --> 03:14:45,129
I I will admit that I think about it every night before I go to bed may have been a small

2881
03:14:46,010 --> 03:14:49,049
A small little bit passive aggressive. It may have been

2882
03:14:49,850 --> 03:14:58,829
I admit that okay. Everyone's just keeping those codes for himself

2883
03:14:59,629 --> 03:15:04,239
You guys look crazy

2884
03:15:05,399 --> 03:15:07,399

2890
03:15:33,559 --> 03:15:35,559

2891
03:15:37,799 --> 03:15:40,360

You do sound like a guy who would download fake pc security programs and getting a hundred toolbars on ie

2899
03:16:18,840 --> 03:16:21,399
You must have downloaded bonzi buddy in your life as well

did

2901
03:16:23,079 --> 03:16:26,040
Bonzi buddy was fun. At least that was a fun virus

2902
03:16:26,760 --> 03:16:29,450
I'm, okay with that one

2903
03:16:29,450 --> 03:16:31,610

Character specialist witty drive humor. My voice can be changed to sound extremely elderly kind old man senile old man

2905
03:16:39,129 --> 03:16:41,209
I'm extremely confident with my older sounding men

2906
03:16:41,770 --> 03:16:47,049
My voice can also be used for intelligent but flawed deep sounding characters listen to my demo for a better understanding

2907
03:16:51,739 --> 03:16:57,360
Bilactery lich. Thanks for the fuck me bilactery lich. Thanks for the 5000 bits

2909
03:17:05,290 --> 03:17:08,889
That austin powers deep fake was just germa's family dinner part two

2910
03:17:13,770 --> 03:17:17,879
something like that

2911
03:17:17,879 --> 03:17:22,760
Thank you bilactery for your like seven thousand dollars you've given this stream over the last four months

2912
03:17:23,879 --> 03:17:28,280
And I mean that like unironically. That's like probably how much it's been more than that probably

2913
03:17:30,270 --> 03:17:32,430
Brick built. Thanks for the 500 bits

2914
03:17:35,479 --> 03:17:40,360
Here's some funds for your upcoming legal battle with nintendo. Keep up the good work. I'm the number one labo streamer on twitch

2915
03:17:41,239 --> 03:17:43,639
At least 30 people bought a labo because of me

2916
03:17:44,520 --> 03:17:48,040
Right. It was it was a 9 000 people that were concurrently watching the labo stream

2917
03:17:48,280 --> 03:17:52,360
Okay, but like at least 20 at least 24 people bought a labo because of me

2918
03:17:53,159 --> 03:17:55,159
Come on, they're not gonna come out

2919
03:18:02,559 --> 03:18:04,559
They have to pay me to buy a labo

2920
03:18:04,639 --> 03:18:07,360
Don't don't say that say I bought one and it was fucking fun

2921
03:18:10,840 --> 03:18:13,000
Hey moo means moo. Thanks for another 500 bits

2922
03:18:13,719 --> 03:18:17,000
Those wipe effects you be you have between the different screens look clean as hell

2923
03:18:17,479 --> 03:18:20,840
Which is surprising is the concept of a clean wipe must be foreign to you

2924
03:18:21,639 --> 03:18:23,639
This joke wasn't worth 10

2925
03:18:24,200 --> 03:18:25,559
bucks

2926
03:18:25,559 --> 03:18:35,049
I don't know. What is that? What's that saying? I don't wipe my ass. I don't get it

2927
03:18:37,129 --> 03:18:41,129
Seven layer wario. Thanks for the thousand bits ten dollars. Here's some bits for you medical troubles

2928
03:18:41,690 --> 03:18:46,329
I know how hard that it can be and I hope it goes well best of wishes. Hope you're doing great. Have a good night you two

2929
03:18:49,850 --> 03:18:51,850
Thanks for the consideration. Thanks for the support

2930
03:18:52,329 --> 03:18:56,159
Anybody that's ever had mystery medical problems that you don't know what the hell's wrong with you

2931
03:18:56,159 --> 03:18:59,360
I've had him too and it sucks. This is this is round two. It's really annoying

2932
03:19:00,159 --> 03:19:06,590
Back when I first had the colitis and Crohn's you've Crohn's you've colitis you have proctitis

2933
03:19:07,129 --> 03:19:10,090
When all that bullshit that went on five six seven straight years

2934
03:19:11,129 --> 03:19:14,969
And I finally figured it out and I've been all right with that. Here we go again round two

2935
03:19:15,610 --> 03:19:18,170
Oh now you have like chest and back pain like it's like

2936
03:19:18,889 --> 03:19:23,610
Internal pain. All right, who fucking knows what the hell it is. Good luck. See in three years when you find out

2937
03:19:23,930 --> 03:19:25,450
It's a pain in the ass

2938
03:19:25,450 --> 03:19:29,549
But you do what you gotta do

2939
03:19:29,549 --> 03:19:32,670
You do what you gotta do and you just try to figure it out. That's all you can do

2940
03:19:33,549 --> 03:19:43,290
I didn't realize you were having medical problems recently when I donated that no, it's all good. Don't worry

2941
03:19:43,850 --> 03:19:47,850
I'm fine. I'm doing just fine. If I wasn't fine, I wouldn't stream

2942
03:19:48,969 --> 03:19:54,170
If I was seriously in pain or if I was uncomfortable right now, I would not be live and you guys all know that

2943
03:19:55,049 --> 03:19:57,049
I hope that I've made that really clear

2944
03:19:58,440 --> 03:20:05,000
If I was not in if I was not having a good time and I'm not like forcing myself to turn a stream on trust me

2945
03:20:06,120 --> 03:20:11,239
Absolutely, not if it ever got there

2946
03:20:12,040 --> 03:20:16,280
I would take time off and you know, I would so don't worry about me. I'm gonna be just fine

2947
03:20:23,930 --> 03:20:26,409
I was under the impression that you shit your pants every single stream

2948
03:20:27,129 --> 03:20:29,879
Yeah, but that's completely unrelated

2949
03:20:30,200 --> 03:20:34,600
E word toward E word toward thanks for the 250. You better play halo 1 when it's released or you're getting banned

2950
03:20:42,840 --> 03:20:47,739
Halo. All right. All right. I'm gonna I have to play halo just by myself silently

2951
03:20:49,120 --> 03:20:55,690
Like maybe with on stream. I'm not gonna play it on legendary. I'm just gonna be silent and play it

2952
03:20:56,489 --> 03:21:02,989
I'm gonna bump you for a second here. Sorry about that. You all right

2953
03:21:04,350 --> 03:21:06,590
Let's see the credits going to come all the subs

2954
03:21:06,590 --> 03:21:10,590
There was a lot of community subs as you see there's a shitload of subs on this channel almost 11 000

2955
03:21:10,909 --> 03:21:15,469
There are almost 11 000 subs on the channel 11 fucking thousand subs, right?

2956
03:21:16,590 --> 03:21:17,549

2959
03:21:23,069 --> 03:21:29,340
Hopefully I spent it. Well, I hope to still climb

2960
03:21:33,069 --> 03:21:34,909
We good. We good. We good

2961
03:21:34,909 --> 03:21:45,280
Maybe don't let us down by promising a reach stream. I streamed halo reach. I did. No, no, no

2962
03:21:45,520 --> 03:21:47,520
Hold on. I have to get this has to be corrected

2963
03:21:48,079 --> 03:21:54,159
I promised a halo reach stream and I played halo 2. I played halo reach with joe

2964
03:21:54,639 --> 03:21:59,840
It was one of the worst streams I ever did. I did I did play it and that was on one of the worst streams of 2019

2965
03:22:00,959 --> 03:22:09,020
That's what was voted. It was voted as one of the worst streams 2019. I liked that stream

2966
03:22:09,659 --> 03:22:17,770
But i'm sure the ceo of burger king thinks the chicken fries are good

2967
03:22:18,700 --> 03:22:20,219
So, I mean

2968
03:22:20,219 --> 03:22:23,309
