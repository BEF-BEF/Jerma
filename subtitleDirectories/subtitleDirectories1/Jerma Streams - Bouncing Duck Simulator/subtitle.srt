1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,159
How's it going?

2
00:00:03,109 --> 00:00:03,609
What's up?

3
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,699
Today, we're going to play Bouncing Duck Simulator.

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,940
Those of you that watched the Team Fortress 2 Man vs.

5
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:34,979
Machine stream, you would know that Poke gave us a pretty, pretty good

6
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:36,320
recommendation to play this game.

7
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:39,219
So we'll find out.

8
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:45,549
I, I do trust Poke's game recommendations, plays a lot of interesting stuff.

9
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,469
So here we go.

10
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,899
It looks kind of, it looks kind of good.

11
00:00:58,539 --> 00:00:59,659
It looks pretty good.

12
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,170
I feel like I'm going to have fun with this for a little while.

13
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:11,780
I thought you retired.

14
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:20,209
I mean, yeah, it doesn't mean I'm not going to, I'm going to stream when I feel

15
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:24,329
like it and make YouTube videos still and work it off brand and check in.

16
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:25,969
Yeah, what's up?

17
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:26,469
I'm here.

18
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:27,390
I'm right here.

19
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:29,319
I'm right here.

20
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,200
I'm still here.

21
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,980
He's a YouTuber now.

22
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:46,670
I can still hear him.

23
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:47,010
Yeah.

24
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,510
Cause I'm live right now.

25
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,430
About to play Bouncing Duck Simulator.

26
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:53,519
All right.

27
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,060
You guys ready?

28
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,019
I don't know.

29
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:57,459
The stream might not, might not be too long.

30
00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:02,670
I know Armored Core 6 is the elephant in the room, but we'll see.

31
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:04,390
I did say I wanted to play this too.

32
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,469
Maybe I'll try Armored Core 6 on my own.

33
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:09,629
Maybe I'll stream it.

34
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:10,750
Maybe I won't.

35
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:12,469
Maybe we'll play Sorcery.

36
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:20,909
I don't know, but let's go.

37
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:25,680
You guys ready?

38
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,099
This song, by the way, has been stuck in my head since I was sitting here.

39
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,150
Listen to that.

40
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,789
Ready for the song?

41
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,830
Not the one.

42
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,509
I mean, this one's a, this is a banger too, but hold on.

43
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:36,009
Listen to this one.

44
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:42,159
This one has just been burning in my brain for a full, I want to say 20, 30

45
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,479
minutes of hanging out and getting ready.

46
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,120
You guys ready to hear this?

47
00:02:56,189 --> 00:02:57,469
This is what I've been setting up to.

48
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:02,889
It's a, it, this thing's great.

49
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:03,449
It's great.

50
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:16,180
I can't, I, yeah, this is the game that poke mentioned.

51
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:16,680
Yeah.

52
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:25,219
I got to like DM poke and be like, Hey, I got to give him a review after this.

53
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:27,370
I will give him a full review.

54
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:34,139
That full review is going to be one sentence, but all right.

55
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:34,620
You guys ready?

56
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,120
Let's just play.

57
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,620
Let's hang out.

58
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:39,740
Make it louder, louder, louder, louder.

59
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,009
Um, it's kind of, it's all right.

60
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:44,050
That's good enough right here.

61
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,689
I don't know how loud the rest of the game is.

62
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:46,189
So not yet.

63
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:47,669
All right.

64
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:48,870
Bouncing duck simulator.

65
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,150
Start new game.

66
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,099
Stir would hate this game.

67
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:02,740
Oh, that's right.

68
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,020
Yes.

69
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,460
Durr would hate this.

70
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:09,270
All right.

71
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,990
So we woke up, we're in a, we're in a room.

72
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,259
Okay.

73
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,060
This mouse sensitivity is very high.

74
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,579
Hold on.

75
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,670
Uh, give me one sec.

76
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,430
How do I turn the mouse sensitivity down?

77
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,540
I do.

78
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:24,899
Okay.

79
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:26,660
Wait, can I do it through here?

80
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:32,259
How do I change the DPI of my mouse?

81
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,899
Does anybody know?

82
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,509
How do I affect the DPI of my mouse?

83
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,779
You're a grown ass man.

84
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:47,319
Yeah.

85
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:53,019
Wait, do I have to open up my like razor program?

86
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,160
Okay.

87
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,660
Razor.

88
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,240
This is the thing that I force quit every single time it opens, but I'm opening it

89
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,920
for real now.

90
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:03,980
Okay.

91
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,480
Here it is.

92
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:05,540
Okay.

93
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,600
Uh, I don't have performance.

94
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:11,870
Okay.

95
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,629
Sensitivity.

96
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:14,189
The number of dots per inch.

97
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,980
It's currently at, I'm going to put it at 800.

98
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:18,939
See if that helps.

99
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,240
Holy shit.

100
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,959
This sucks.

101
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:23,790
How's it in here though?

102
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,250
Ooh, that's actually much better.

103
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:29,370
It has to be even lower.

104
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,990
Hold on.

105
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:33,730
Even lower.

106
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,050
Like one, like 600 probably.

107
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,579
Oh my God.

108
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:39,180
This is awful.

109
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:42,480
All right.

110
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:42,980
There we go.

111
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,920
I think that's okay.

112
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,079
I might have to lower it a little more later.

113
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,790
Why did I turn it off?

114
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,740
Okay.

115
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,069
That's much better.

116
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,310
Like a million times, but okay.

117
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,389
13, five, six.

118
00:05:59,389 --> 00:05:59,889
What does this mean?

119
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:00,410
Zero.

120
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:00,970
What's up?

121
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,720
Okay. That's turning music on and off.

122
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:08,629
I mean, we're going to keep the music on.

123
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,000
Is there a sprint?

124
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,819
What do I get?

125
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,519
What do I get a duck?

126
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,199
Oh, wait, we're here.

127
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,959
Poke is worried that you're going to hate this and be mad at him.

128
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:33,720
That was okay.

129
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,639
This is loud.

130
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,160
I'm, I'm turning it down.

131
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,189
Oh, poke, poke.

132
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:42,910
Our friendship relies on me enjoying this game.

133
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:43,490
Uh oh.

134
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,490
He's nervous.

135
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,529
I'm going to love it.

136
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:51,050
It's a game where you, you don't have that to play.

137
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:53,350
I love these kinds of games.

138
00:06:54,829 --> 00:06:58,709
Poke. One of my favorite games of all time is a game where you clean houses and

139
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,149
like hit walls with a fucking sledgehammer.

140
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:02,850
I, we're going to, it's going to be fine.

141
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,279
I just got 10 bounces.

142
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,279
That's gotta be a record.

143
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,680
Okay. So a whole left click and then left go to throw it.

144
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,319
Okay. What does right click do?

145
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,319
I'm going to do the thing.

146
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,079
I'm going to take my bouncy ball.

147
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:31,410
I'm going to run, sprint, hop, hop, hop, jump at the ground as hard as I can.

148
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:33,980
It didn't really work.

149
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:38,569
Can I spawn more than one?

150
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:43,560
No.

151
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:45,370
I only have 27 bounces.

152
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,540
What, how do I get more into the corner?

153
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:57,259
I probably get, if I get to a hundred, I bet it changes.

154
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,600
I kind of feel like a dog right now, but that's all right.

155
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,139
What happens when I get to a hundred?

156
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,139
99. All right.

157
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,379
This is it. 100.

158
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:30,720
I just got it.

159
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:33,500
Oh shit.

160
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,500
All right. So now I can press this button.

161
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,850
I have two, I have two ducks in here now.

162
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:43,720
What is this?

163
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:45,860
Health?

164
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:47,820
What do I do with that?

165
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,240
Can I feed it to the duck or something?

166
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,539
Whoa. Okay.

167
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:02,039
It's bigger.

168
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:07,909
Does this count for more bounces?

169
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:09,740
It was a battery.

170
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:10,419
All right. Well, all right.

171
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:11,059
I get it. I get it.

172
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:12,299
I know. I get the game now.

173
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,019
Poke. Don't ever call me ever again.

174
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:19,960
I'm just kidding.

175
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,460
I think I actually, I'm going to really like this.

176
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,299
I get it.

177
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:35,860
I get what's going on right now.

178
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,100
I'm into this.

179
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,340
I got to get to two.

180
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,100
What? 500?

181
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:52,139
I'm going, I think going in the corner corner, we'll get at least three or four.

182
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:52,460
Right?

183
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,980
If we stuff it in here and get it glitched.

184
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,600
That's a good strategy.

185
00:09:58,799 --> 00:09:59,759
500. I'm going 500.

186
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,179
Shit.

187
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,039
Whoa. I got more.

188
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,500
Can I pick up more than one?

189
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,679
These things are worth two.

190
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,580
Watch this.

191
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:17,639
Can I pick up more than one?

192
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,070
Okay.

193
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:30,840
I love how this game was recommended for me.

194
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,580
Hey man.

195
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:35,200
I got a great game that I think you'll really like.

196
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,379
Oh, what is it?

197
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,980
Baldur's Gate 3.

198
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,360
Strategy.

199
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:41,059
RPG elements.

200
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,080
There's a lot of decision-making.

201
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,700
Not that one.

202
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:46,730
Armored Core 6.

203
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:47,970
Action-oriented.

204
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:54,450
Tons of difficult boss encounters and tons of upgrades to put in your character and make a mech that you can fight with.

205
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:55,929
Not that one either.

206
00:10:57,049 --> 00:11:00,129
Dude, I think you'd be a huge fan of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom.

207
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:04,769
You can explore a vast, incredibly large open world.

208
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:07,090
And create any- No, not that one either.

209
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,460
I'd like to have you play with toys.

210
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:12,690
Now that one.

211
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:14,450
That's the one for you.

212
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:22,080
I'm just chasing around dog toys.

213
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:26,529
Is this what Otto feels like?

214
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:32,659
He's got Otto brain.

215
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,059
Oh, I got another one.

216
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:34,639
Oh, look.

217
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,620
Another thing to press.

218
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:38,759
Yes.

219
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,230
What is it?

220
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:42,929
All right. This is a big deal.

221
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,559
Do I give the battery to the pink one or to the yellow one?

222
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,789
Should we keep them the same size or?

223
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,179
I'm going for that.

224
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,169
To me, that was the right.

225
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:08,190
All right. What about like, wait, I can't pick it up anymore.

226
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,179
Why can I not pick it up?

227
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,090
How much is it?

228
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,029
Wait, I can't pick it up.

229
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:23,700
Oh, that's worth 10 now.

230
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,200
I think.

231
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:25,490
All right. I got it.

232
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:27,809
Just keep throwing shit at it.

233
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,379
You ruined it.

234
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,100
You need to restart.

235
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,360
No, I'm good.

236
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:39,639
I'll be okay.

237
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:46,509
Nice. Okay.

238
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:47,190
Thousand.

239
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:53,600
That one's different.

240
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,179
Okay. This one is permanently bouncing.

241
00:12:59,309 --> 00:12:59,830
We're going to have to.

242
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,909
Okay. When we get the next level up, we're giving it to that one.

243
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:09,289
Also, by the way, I do apologize for anybody that does have a dog in the room and you're listening to this with a speaker.

244
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:12,740
Honestly, I can't.

245
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,820
There's not much I can do about it.

246
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:23,580
It's either that or turn off the volume, but I'm probably making a lot of your dogs head tilt at your computer right now.

247
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,419
And I, for that, I apologize.

248
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:29,509
All right. We got more.

249
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,590
Almost at 1500.

250
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:33,669
This one's different.

251
00:13:33,669 --> 00:13:34,350
This one's like glass.

252
00:13:35,179 --> 00:13:35,679
What is this one?

253
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,600
Can I break this one?

254
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,320
I'm scared to break it.

255
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,509
This is worth a hundred.

256
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:43,629
How much is that worth?

257
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:45,769
Okay, dude.

258
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:55,309
Oh, oh, I don't know if I did that wrong, but whatever.

259
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:02,330
All right. We have to focus on bouncing the big one with the little one.

260
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,210
That one's just a permanent stat increases.

261
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,059
So I'm gonna play this for at least a couple hours.

262
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,860
Like, that's what's happening today.

263
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:14,590
Ow!

264
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,320
Is this a pre-recorded stream?

265
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:21,820
No.

266
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:24,539
Wait, I can press the button.

267
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,620
All right. All right.

268
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,539
All right. This is, this is really important.

269
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,169
I'm going to give this to you because I want you to get, that's the right call, right?

270
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,820
Min maxing this, you would give them all to this eventually.

271
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:41,679
All right, here we go.

272
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:44,169
What's that giving me?

273
00:14:46,539 --> 00:14:47,460
That's 20 each one.

274
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:49,169
All right. Keep that one moving.

275
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:50,929
Can I trap that in a corner or something?

276
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:04,059
Is he going to play this for 52 hours?

277
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,379
Not that long.

278
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,600
I do want to get to at least a million bounces.

279
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:11,799
Is that going to take a long time?

280
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:15,620
Is that going to take like more than two hours?

281
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:21,750
More.

282
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:22,899
More!

283
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:27,190
Okay. That one, all this one's metal.

284
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,490
I wonder if this one breaks.

285
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:35,070
Is that worth anything?

286
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:40,419
I can't tell.

287
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:41,279
That's not very much.

288
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:46,059
Maybe, I guess it moves more?

289
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,220
Heavier?

290
00:15:59,370 --> 00:15:59,870
Nice.

291
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:04,350
I'm definitely gonna get to a million.

292
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:04,850
Easy.

293
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,580
I have so much training playing any video game on the iPad.

294
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,909
I'm going to be really good at this.

295
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,580
It kind of sounds like they're like yelling at each other or something.

296
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:34,840
He's an iPad baby.

297
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,200
I'm already at 10,000.

298
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,320
You don't think I'm going to get to a million?

299
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,210
All right. What do I up?

300
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,490
I'm going to upgrade this one again.

301
00:16:45,049 --> 00:16:46,250
It's just too consistent.

302
00:16:53,659 --> 00:16:54,419
I mean, the game is corrupt.

303
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,259
Is that going to keep, is that going to keep going the whole time?

304
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,529
That's not going to stay there the whole time, right?

305
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:13,539
Because I don't think I can sit in this room for two, more than an hour,

306
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:14,779
listening to this on loop.

307
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:29,150
Well, this one's magical.

308
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:31,559
What if I do this?

309
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:32,839
Shit.

310
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,619
All right.

311
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,700
I might have to put my own music on.

312
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:47,099
I'm going to have to put my own.

313
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,859
All right. At what point have I won listening to this?

314
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:52,420
Does anybody, anybody want to tell me?

315
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,420
At what point have I won?

316
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:57,150
30 minutes?

317
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:00,759
What if I just do it again?

318
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,500
Get over here.

319
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:15,319
Oh, get the fuck over here.

320
00:18:25,829 --> 00:18:29,710
You're doing, you're doing like what every cartoon character in every single

321
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,509
piece of media does when they have sugar.

322
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,319
I don't, I don't think I can, I can't pick it up.

323
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,220
All right.

324
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,839
Where's the, where is it?

325
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,920
No, I lost it.

326
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:57,000
Oh my God.

327
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:11,089
Shit.

328
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:12,849
All right. All right.

329
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:13,289
All right. Right.

330
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:14,410
Right. I have to just yield it.

331
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,190
I'm giving it to this one.

332
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:34,299
If I knew that I was going to do nonstop Nyan cat, we would not be in this

333
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,299
scenario right now, but here we are.

334
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,430
If what, what 50 K is going to give me something good.

335
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:51,930
Probably. Right.

336
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,950
Should I break this?

337
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,599
All right. 50 K.

338
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,019
What's this one?

339
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,079
This one's just a regular one.

340
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:18,069
It's a blue one.

341
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:18,569
Yeah.

342
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,759
This thing is somehow not hitting anything in the room.

343
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:26,950
What is this giving for points?

344
00:20:27,349 --> 00:20:27,990
Like 80.

345
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:33,140
All right. We got to actually start to use skill here.

346
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,809
This feels like an experiment.

347
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:39,869
A hundred K is going to get something good.

348
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:40,369
Right?

349
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,039
What's pokes high score.

350
00:20:54,509 --> 00:20:54,829
I should wait.

351
00:20:54,829 --> 00:20:55,190
Don't tell me.

352
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:55,549
Don't tell me.

353
00:20:55,549 --> 00:20:55,910
Don't tell me.

354
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:56,410
Nobody tell me.

355
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:57,109
Nobody tell me.

356
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:00,670
Uh, clear chat, mods, clear chat, mods, clear chat, mods, clear chat,

357
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:02,349
mods, clear chat.

358
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:03,450
Nobody tell me.

359
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,720
I have to, I have to beat pokes, uh, score, whatever it is.

360
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,319
72.

361
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,000
I got to get to a hundred K.

362
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:32,289
I have to turn this off at some point.

363
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,930
I personally can't take this.

364
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,279
I personally don't think I could take this.

365
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,960
This not the game, this song.

366
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,549
Look, it's a classic classic song.

367
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:53,960
Wait, that's another power up.

368
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:54,799
All right.

369
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,400
Can I please feed it to you?

370
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,710
Do you turn into something else?

371
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,440
Come here.

372
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:04,599
Come here.

373
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:04,839
Come here.

374
00:22:12,349 --> 00:22:13,109
I'm just gonna stand still.

375
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:13,829
It'll hit me eventually.

376
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,980
It's given a lot of points though.

377
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:22,900
Right here.

378
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:27,319
Stupid.

379
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:41,630
I can't track it.

380
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,089
Just give it to the crystal.

381
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,160
Oh, I can't.

382
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,759
Um, who should I give it to?

383
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,799
Is this it fully upgraded?

384
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:54,759
What about the King?

385
00:22:55,619 --> 00:22:55,900
No.

386
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,460
Uh, what about blue?

387
00:23:01,859 --> 00:23:02,299
No.

388
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,539
Who can I give this to?

389
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:07,920
Whoa.

390
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,839
Somebody just to throw pink.

391
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,759
Oh, guys make one.

392
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,680
Hold on a second.

393
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,400
I just made.

394
00:23:16,849 --> 00:23:18,289
Oh dear God.

395
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:20,190
Oh dear God.

396
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:38,039
Uh, where's wait, I need both of you over here in the corner.

397
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,240
No shit.

398
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:39,640
Come here.

399
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:47,869
Can I crouch a hundred thousand bounces?

400
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:48,230
Let's go.

401
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:51,880
Okay.

402
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,339
How much is this one worth?

403
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,700
That's a lot.

404
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:04,359
I think this, ah, it's a bomb.

405
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:04,799
It's a bomb.

406
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:05,240
That's a bomb.

407
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:05,559
It's a bomb.

408
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:05,880
It's a bomb.

409
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,200
It's a bomb.

410
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,240
Just leave it over there.

411
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:14,180
I want to shut that off so bad.

412
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:24,000
I used to, how do I upgrade?

413
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,140
Who wants to upgrade?

414
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:26,779
What about you?

415
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:33,460
Get over here.

416
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:36,200
Why can't I upgrade anybody?

417
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:39,140
Oh shit.

418
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:39,900
That turned gold.

419
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:54,150
Should I blow one of these up?

420
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:56,200
I'm afraid of this.

421
00:25:05,259 --> 00:25:06,059
I, we need to make more.

422
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:17,940
This is so loud.

423
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,859
I'm so glad I turned it down.

424
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,130
I think it's all about making, um, I think I honestly, I think it's all about putting

425
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,490
on the plock OST in five minutes.

426
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:30,740
You know what I mean?

427
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:40,799
I'm into this though.

428
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,190
I I'm definitely into, uh, I want to keep this going.

429
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,190
I want to get, I gotta get to a million.

430
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:50,609
If you're going to open this game, you'd better get to a million points.

431
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,210
Otherwise, why did you open it?

432
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,269
Why did you open the game?

433
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:54,549
Right?

434
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:55,630
I think that's fair.

435
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:07,720
Each one of these bounces from the baby is given, uh, at least one.

436
00:26:13,769 --> 00:26:14,329
He's in the way.

437
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:14,890
Let me move him.

438
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,009
I hate when it flies by my head.

439
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:31,869
It's like somebody's zooming by me.

440
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:38,460
It's like when a fly flies right next to your head and it's in full stride and you

441
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,339
get that by your, oh, imagine if they played Nyan cat.

442
00:26:46,089 --> 00:26:46,849
Another one of these.

443
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:52,529
One 50 probably is a milestone somehow.

444
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,700
I talk about like YouTube shorts.

445
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,059
Oh yeah.

446
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:10,259
I checked out YouTube shorts the other day and oh, I wasn't a big, I wasn't a fan.

447
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,329
And this is what I'm exposing all of you to.

448
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,720
There's a, there's a little bit of hypocrisy there.

449
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,130
I'm just going to focus on this.

450
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:02,750
Folks said, dude, he just disappeared from my friends list.

451
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:11,009
Just like, oh, he, why is he not?

452
00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:12,329
Why is it not online anymore?

453
00:28:12,329 --> 00:28:12,970
What happened?

454
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,130
I, is he, is he appearing offline or what happened?

455
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:26,569
No, if anything, poke, this strengthened our friendship.

456
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,650
I just want to make sure you understand that.

457
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:34,250
This, this strengthened our bond.

458
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,440
What's the goal?

459
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:43,019
Well, that's simple.

460
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,440
Number on right side of screen goes up.

461
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:48,640
That's it.

462
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,920
It's pretty, I mean, it's pretty self-explanatory, I think.

463
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,529
Number on screen go up.

464
00:29:11,259 --> 00:29:11,779
I like.

465
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,039
Oh, will we, will we, I can't fucking do it.

466
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:29,319
Will we reach 500,000 subs today, guys?

467
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:30,319
I don't know.

468
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,440
I have a feeling it's possible.

469
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,279
Will we cross 200,000 subs tonight?

470
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,319
What would I have had to have done to get this many subs immediately?

471
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:55,569
What would be causing this amount of people to sub to a channel this fast?

472
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,049
What would it take?

473
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:02,019
Is this what, this is what happens if I shove the baseball up my ass?

474
00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:02,539
Somebody said.

475
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:18,609
I'm not, I'm not, I am not shoving a baseball up my ass until we hit a million subs.

476
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:18,970
Right?

477
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:20,769
Let's just sit here.

478
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:21,730
Just what?

479
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:22,410
Just holding it.

480
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:33,279
I feel like it would be going down.

481
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,759
This would be going down.

482
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:36,769
This would not be going up.

483
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:37,930
This would be going down.

484
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:49,859
No, this is very, hey, everybody in chat, quiet for a second.

485
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:53,019
We're talking about a comedic jokey thing.

486
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,779
This is not a real thing.

487
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:56,420
We're just talking about a jokey thing.

488
00:30:56,539 --> 00:31:00,650
This is me pretending, please for the love of God, stop it.

489
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:01,890
Stop.

490
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:04,849
We already crossed a million followers in the channel like a year ago.

491
00:31:05,049 --> 00:31:06,450
So excuse me.

492
00:31:14,259 --> 00:31:14,420
All right.

493
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,619
We'll check back in on that later.

494
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:21,430
All right.

495
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:21,950
What's the next one?

496
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,960
Ooh, what are we going to upgrade?

497
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:26,279
What can I upgrade?

498
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,440
The bomb?

499
00:31:39,859 --> 00:31:41,059
I don't think you can upgrade some of them.

500
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,839
Some of them just cannot be upgraded.

501
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,720
What about one of the little babies?

502
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,160
I got to get my subs up.

503
00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:06,630
Oh, I farted.

504
00:32:09,789 --> 00:32:10,190
It's working.

505
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:10,549
It's working.

506
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,720
Oh no, they're going to go down.

507
00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:27,690
All right.

508
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:28,089
All right.

509
00:32:28,369 --> 00:32:30,170
I have to turn this fucking audio off.

510
00:32:30,529 --> 00:32:38,779
Is it going to explode?

511
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,880
That honestly, that sounds like a, that sounds like a video that would be made in

512
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,799
2023, right?

513
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:54,960
On the wall here, I have my sub count.

514
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:59,740
I have to be in this room until my subs go over a million.

515
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:04,240
I cannot leave the room until it crosses that threshold.

516
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:15,920
I need more of these.

517
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,299
Look at this.

518
00:33:17,619 --> 00:33:18,019
Look at this.

519
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:18,940
There's something here.

520
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:19,900
There's something on this wall too.

521
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,099
Look.

522
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:21,539
See this?

523
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:23,500
This like panels.

524
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,460
I'll probably get to open them.

525
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:25,180
I bet.

526
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:27,769
All right.

527
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:28,049
What was that?

528
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:28,450
Two 50.

529
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,130
What happens in two 50?

530
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,269
Maybe smash them with the metal duck.

531
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,029
Okay.

532
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:39,059
I mean that very clearly, it probably, maybe you upgrade it and it opens to like

533
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:39,940
another button to press.

534
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:41,089
All right.

535
00:33:41,089 --> 00:33:45,670
Where is, where is the metal duck over here?

536
00:33:49,369 --> 00:33:50,769
That was, it's so loud.

537
00:33:51,819 --> 00:33:53,180
So you say smash this against the wall.

538
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:56,880
It worked.

539
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,160
It worked.

540
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:57,440
It worked.

541
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:57,680
It worked.

542
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:57,880
All right.

543
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,279
All right.

544
00:33:58,359 --> 00:33:58,880
I got something.

545
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,200
What is this?

546
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,279
X marks that.

547
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:01,369
All right.

548
00:34:01,369 --> 00:34:01,890
What about over here?

549
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:09,349
Ooh, what's that?

550
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:18,880
Yeah.

551
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,840
I knew you could open those.

552
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,159
Is there any more of those?

553
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,119
There's gotta be.

554
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:29,039
Wait, a bomb.

555
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:29,960
Bomb, bomb, bomb.

556
00:34:32,769 --> 00:34:33,530
Why is this a skeleton?

557
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,000
I'm going to throw the bomb at this.

558
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,480
It's absolutely what you have to do.

559
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:42,070
There's one on the roof.

560
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:43,880
Oh, there is one right there.

561
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,199
I don't think I can make that though.

562
00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:50,570
Maybe with the, I don't think I had to like get higher.

563
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:53,440
All right.

564
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:53,719
Two.

565
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,639
We crossed two 50.

566
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,400
No button to press.

567
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,710
Who can I, can I, can I actually upgrade the, this thing still?

568
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:18,920
The, the Nyan one, or will you guys upgrade the skeleton?

569
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,159
Ooh, can I?

570
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,559
Whoa, it worked.

571
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:23,869
What does that do?

572
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:25,250
It has a face.

573
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:27,280
Is it worth anything?

574
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:28,800
I can't tell.

575
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,119
Okay.

576
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:34,519
That's cool.

577
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:38,639
We got to keep these things moving.

578
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:40,280
If you see one on the ground, it's not moving.

579
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:40,920
We have to make it move.

580
00:35:47,469 --> 00:35:47,869
There we go.

581
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:48,750
That's much faster.

582
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:50,880
Something broke.

583
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:51,599
Whoa.

584
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:52,800
What, what was that?

585
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:55,039
Oh, look at this.

586
00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:02,239
One of the big ones broke into a little ones that are giving me more.

587
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,300
I think when they break, they give you money or whatever it is.

588
00:36:06,659 --> 00:36:08,820
Subscribers or whatever, whatever that who cares.

589
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:12,679
Nice.

590
00:36:16,409 --> 00:36:16,650
Yeah.

591
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:16,929
All right.

592
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:19,460
Bomb on X bomb on X.

593
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,260
I can't get it to blow up.

594
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,539
Do I need a fire duck?

595
00:36:22,269 --> 00:36:22,949
That would make sense.

596
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:40,920
I, you know, if there was a statistic to tell how many people muted the stream,

597
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:43,679
put it on the other monitor and are doing something else on the other monitor.

598
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:48,179
I think I might've broken the record for this channel right now.

599
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,059
Oh, pixel duck.

600
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:11,210
Dude.

601
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,170
That's every stream.

602
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,869
That's you're, you're so funny.

603
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:23,579
All right.

604
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:32,539
We have to blow this wall up with the bomb, but I don't think we're going to move the

605
00:37:32,539 --> 00:37:33,340
big one around more.

606
00:37:34,139 --> 00:37:35,059
It's worth so much more.

607
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:43,559
Where'd it go?

608
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,559
There we go.

609
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:46,920
Look at that.

610
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,840
300 K already.

611
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,300
What is it worth?

612
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:08,969
It's hard to tell.

613
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:16,750
All right.

614
00:38:16,789 --> 00:38:20,039
Every, uh, everybody minimize the screen for a second.

615
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:24,719
Okay.

616
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,679
Minimize the screen.

617
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,849
Just like, don't just don't watch for a second.

618
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:29,530
I'm warning you.

619
00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:30,170
Here we go.

620
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,559
Three, two.

621
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,800
What's going to get wild on the screen.

622
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,199
You ready?

623
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:35,039
Three, two, one.

624
00:38:38,309 --> 00:38:39,550
That actually might be a good strategy.

625
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:54,559
I think we just need to do more of this.

626
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,280
No, I don't want more than 340,000 subs.

627
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,599
It's going to crash my computer.

628
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,659
I need to break this very clearly.

629
00:39:06,849 --> 00:39:08,530
The last one broke and it was, it gave us a lot.

630
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,880
Throw gold at glass duck.

631
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,880
I was going to try that after.

632
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:33,929
Oh, it's going to work.

633
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:34,690
I can hear it.

634
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,300
Ooh.

635
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:55,409
Um, all right.

636
00:39:55,409 --> 00:40:00,929
Once we get to half a million, I will put on whatever, uh, mods.

637
00:40:01,329 --> 00:40:02,489
Just, Hey mods.

638
00:40:02,969 --> 00:40:05,849
It's hard for me to talk, to take, to think and talk.

639
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:11,059
Um, can, can one of you, all right, hold on.

640
00:40:11,059 --> 00:40:12,139
I need to say, I need to take my headphones out.

641
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:20,250
Uh, can somebody put a poll up of four fun OSTs to listen to and

642
00:40:20,449 --> 00:40:21,690
just check and vote on it?

643
00:40:21,769 --> 00:40:23,369
Mods can determine what they are.

644
00:40:23,409 --> 00:40:24,849
We're looking for video game OSTs.

645
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:27,010
I'm good.

646
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:28,380
Okay.

647
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,900
Now I, now I cannot talk anymore.

648
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,260
I can't think anymore because my headphones are in.

649
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:36,190
Can you mute the music?

650
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:36,590
I wonder.

651
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,800
Progress will be saved.

652
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:40,920
All right.

653
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,079
Hold on.

654
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:41,480
Wait, wait, wait.

655
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:44,659
Hold on.

656
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:45,300
Can I mute the music?

657
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:47,519
I can't.

658
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,599
What duck decks?

659
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,639
Oh, it tells you what you found.

660
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,000
Wake it up in the corner of the room.

661
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,289
Oh, I don't know.

662
00:41:09,289 --> 00:41:10,289
No, I don't.

663
00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:10,969
I don't.

664
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,880
I don't care about how many subs I have.

665
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:15,619
Why did I do this?

666
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:19,929
Why do I give a shit about this?

667
00:41:19,929 --> 00:41:21,050
I could just be doing anything.

668
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:23,289
I could be relaxing on the couch right now.

669
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:25,820
I don't care about how many subs come in.

670
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:28,940
It's too much.

671
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,500
It's too much.

672
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,340
Too many subs.

673
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:35,579
Hey, what's going on everybody.

674
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:36,460
Welcome back to the video.

675
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:41,420
It's me checking out that sub counter as we see here.

676
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:45,599
It's at 400,000 subs getting there.

677
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,800
I'd like to see that hit a million.

678
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,789
Jerry, I want to see it at a million subs, Jerry.

679
00:42:06,789 --> 00:42:07,710
That's never going to happen.

680
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:09,309
We are absolutely going to get to a million.

681
00:42:09,309 --> 00:42:10,469
There's no way we are not.

682
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:18,360
All right.

683
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:22,250
What do we got for, uh, what we got for, uh, OST voting?

684
00:42:22,969 --> 00:42:23,650
Blow up the wall.

685
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:26,010
I don't know how I was thinking about this.

686
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:26,889
Yeah, I was trying to.

687
00:42:27,449 --> 00:42:28,610
I need to light the fuse.

688
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,199
See, there's a fuse.

689
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:40,679
I need to light, but I was holding that way.

690
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:41,440
These are closed again.

691
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,719
This is going to blow up in my face.

692
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,840
It's going to blow up my face and be extremely loud.

693
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:08,239
I don't think so.

694
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,079
I like that one.

695
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,159
It's like a bullet going by my face.

696
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:35,039
It's that's, I don't like that.

697
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:45,789
Wait, hold on.

698
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:54,539
Can I pick an OST?

699
00:43:54,539 --> 00:43:58,090
The mods have decided on a few, uh, get us in something.

700
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,619
Just chill and play the game.

701
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,119
I haven't seen an upgrade in a while.

702
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:24,960
These are not generating any points.

703
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,159
They have to be increased.

704
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:31,400
What's the diamond?

705
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:34,840
Uh, diamond is a diamond.

706
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:43,840
I can, I don't think I can reach anything up there yet.

707
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:47,239
I can't throw the metal on that.

708
00:44:47,239 --> 00:44:48,480
I can't throw the bomb that high either.

709
00:44:50,139 --> 00:44:50,940
Maybe the bone.

710
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,320
No, I don't think I have enough power to throw.

711
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:02,639
Maybe this one.

712
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,260
Oh, I actually might hit it with that one.

713
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:05,659
Hold on.

714
00:45:10,179 --> 00:45:10,579
Shit.

715
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:15,829
Damn it.

716
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:19,050
Uh, congratulations, everybody.

717
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,050
Plock has won.

718
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:26,750
Uh, give me one sec while I turn this down.

719
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:35,650
All right.

720
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:39,090
I feel like my soul just re-entered my body.

721
00:45:41,769 --> 00:45:41,969
All right.

722
00:45:41,969 --> 00:45:43,170
Let's put on Plock.

723
00:45:43,889 --> 00:45:44,730
Plock OST.

724
00:45:44,769 --> 00:45:46,369
We listen to this all the time, but it's a good one.

725
00:45:58,449 --> 00:45:58,929
All right.

726
00:45:59,969 --> 00:46:00,809
Yeah.

727
00:46:00,849 --> 00:46:03,090
Now everybody can relax.

728
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,400
Now we got a vibe going.

729
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:15,800
There we go.

730
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,010
I'm missing the quacks, but it's fine.

731
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,599
Turn it up a little louder.

732
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,360
You got it.

733
00:46:31,769 --> 00:46:32,769
That's as loud as I'm willing to go.

734
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:36,079
All right.

735
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:36,800
Almost a half million.

736
00:46:38,019 --> 00:46:38,539
Oh shit.

737
00:46:38,539 --> 00:46:40,059
I just, I just turned the stream off.

738
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:49,619
I can jam to this and just play.

739
00:46:50,139 --> 00:46:50,659
I'm into that.

740
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:54,659
All right, here we go.

741
00:46:54,659 --> 00:46:55,539
We're at half a million.

742
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:57,150
Yes.

743
00:47:03,869 --> 00:47:04,070
All right.

744
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:04,750
This is an upgrade.

745
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:07,110
This one's really important because I don't know who to give this to.

746
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:18,010
I think that, can I give it to anybody besides the skeleton?

747
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:18,969
What about the metal one?

748
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:20,090
Bomb?

749
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:28,690
I don't think I can give it to bomb.

750
00:47:29,329 --> 00:47:29,889
All right, here we go.

751
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:32,219
All right.

752
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:34,650
Uh, this one, what did it do?

753
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,360
Give it a pixel duck.

754
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:42,039
Oh shit.

755
00:47:51,019 --> 00:47:52,300
Uh, we're at 515.

756
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,900
It's going, it's going a lot faster.

757
00:47:55,409 --> 00:47:55,570
All right.

758
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:56,250
I'm going to focus.

759
00:47:59,199 --> 00:47:59,719
I need to start.

760
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,599
Look at this.

761
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,119
Look at how terrible I'm doing.

762
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,480
Look at all the, all the ducks that are on the ground that are not bouncing.

763
00:48:09,909 --> 00:48:11,789
What am I, am I, am I even playing the game?

764
00:48:18,739 --> 00:48:20,579
I need to be moving this one a lot.

765
00:48:22,309 --> 00:48:22,550
Yep.

766
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:23,110
There we go.

767
00:48:23,789 --> 00:48:24,590
Look at that number climb.

768
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:30,090
I need to like whack it.

769
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:37,730
This does feel like a YouTube short now.

770
00:48:48,369 --> 00:48:48,889
600.

771
00:48:48,889 --> 00:48:49,650
What happens at a million?

772
00:48:51,769 --> 00:48:52,849
I missed the quacks.

773
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:57,079
I missed the quacks too, but removing the quacks also removed.

774
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:03,079
Um, uh, for the next three hours straight.

775
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:06,650
So it's a sacrifice we had to make.

776
00:49:14,199 --> 00:49:15,000
I got to move the big one.

777
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:15,679
It has the most points.

778
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:18,320
So we just have to use the metal one is continuously move the big one.

779
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:24,510
Just play quacking sounds in the background.

780
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,480
No, no, I, no, I need a break.

781
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:29,119
I need a break.

782
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:30,519
I've been playing this for like 40 minutes.

783
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,480
I need a quick break from all that.

784
00:49:33,699 --> 00:49:37,380
Let me just listen to pluck and throw things into walls and talk just for a little bit.

785
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:39,460
We need a break.

786
00:49:41,769 --> 00:49:42,449
Everything's gonna be all right.

787
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:57,860
There's a speaker box.

788
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:58,780
Yeah.

789
00:49:58,780 --> 00:49:59,780
This is the speaker box.

790
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:02,340
Unfortunately, it only turns off the music coming out of this.

791
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,420
It does not turn off the Nyan cat song.

792
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:15,570
I think I was going to go with some growth and growth makes sense here.

793
00:50:24,969 --> 00:50:25,530
I'm going to focus.

794
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:25,809
Okay.

795
00:50:25,809 --> 00:50:27,849
I'm going to focus on growth for the next 10 straight minutes.

796
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:29,550
All right.

797
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:38,150
So if I do anything besides focus on growth, I would like for you to all to be yell at me because that's exactly what I'm trying to do.

798
00:50:38,989 --> 00:50:45,880
So at one hour streamed exactly is when I'm going to stop focusing on growth.

799
00:50:50,679 --> 00:50:52,400
And then we'll focus on something else for a little bit.

800
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:03,280
If I see one, I'm going to bounce one.

801
00:51:07,159 --> 00:51:08,320
How did I miss that close?

802
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:21,530
Where I wasn't actually, it actually is a little too soft.

803
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:22,329
Let's put it up a little louder.

804
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:32,920
All right.

805
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:33,639
That's a little meatier.

806
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:34,880
That's meatier.

807
00:51:38,949 --> 00:51:41,349
We don't want it to meaty, but we'll be able to hear it.

808
00:51:41,469 --> 00:51:41,829
You'll hear it.

809
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:47,500
All right.

810
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:48,059
Growth, growth.

811
00:51:48,099 --> 00:51:48,420
Yeah, I know.

812
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:48,699
I got it.

813
00:51:48,699 --> 00:51:48,860
Got it.

814
00:52:04,469 --> 00:52:07,389
I love the Super Nintendo trumpet sound.

815
00:52:07,429 --> 00:52:08,309
Well, like what is it?

816
00:52:08,349 --> 00:52:08,750
Tuba.

817
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,039
All right.

818
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:29,079
Seven more minutes of this and then I'll be probably close to a million.

819
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:53,039
600,000 stay in the corner.

820
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:53,599
This is perfect.

821
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,070
I wish these would just automatically jump around.

822
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,159
I need more of those.

823
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:07,679
Um, Nyan cat ones.

824
00:53:19,969 --> 00:53:22,170
Somebody just said, I don't understand.

825
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:29,980
Uh, honestly, I think, I think you do.

826
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:35,000
I think you're just afraid to admit out loud that this is what I'm doing today.

827
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:40,000
So it's like, no, he's not, he's not doing this, right.

828
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:43,869
But I'm into it.

829
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:44,630
So that's what we're doing.

830
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:47,769
You wouldn't get it.

831
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:55,980
I mean, there is not very much to get right now, but there's such, there's such

832
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:59,179
little to get right now that I do understand the, like, what am I looking at here?

833
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:00,139
I get it.

834
00:54:19,099 --> 00:54:19,699
Okay.

835
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,460
Uh, we have five more minutes of this.

836
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:23,099
Five more minutes of growth and we'll be good.

837
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:35,429
All right.

838
00:54:35,429 --> 00:54:36,349
Get moving over here.

839
00:54:36,389 --> 00:54:37,590
What is going on with this corner?

840
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:39,039
Get moving.

841
00:54:58,159 --> 00:54:58,880
Boss fight, right?

842
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:06,829
Shit.

843
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:09,579
Shit.

844
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,519
It's actually going to get hard to pick up the ducks on the ground.

845
00:55:21,369 --> 00:55:23,289
Oh, this is the one that I did that dance to that.

846
00:55:23,289 --> 00:55:24,809
I keep seeing the same dance.

847
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:27,679
Point.

848
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:57,360
Point, point, point, point, you know, the one, uh, three more minutes we'll be at

849
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:08,440
700 and then after that, we're going to bounce around the big King duck and

850
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:11,039
hopefully get to a million pretty quickly.

851
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:28,170
Green light.

852
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:29,170
Ooh, okay.

853
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:30,530
It's 700 Ks in a green light.

854
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:37,050
We got, oh my goodness.

855
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,559
We're still focusing on growth.

856
00:56:44,800 --> 00:57:08,840
So actually starting to get hard to move around.

857
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,260
A million was going to be easy.

858
00:57:22,139 --> 00:57:24,500
Really underestimated how easy that was going to be to get there.

859
00:57:25,659 --> 00:57:26,739
I mean, actually it's an hour.

860
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:29,300
You have to dedicate like at least 30 to 40 minutes to doing this.

861
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:32,639
I mean, I'm into it though.

862
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:32,880
I'm here.

863
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:46,239
Oh wait.

864
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,519
Bit rate, bit rate, bit rate, bit rate.

865
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:49,519
Oh no.

866
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:53,030
Is this going to be a bit rate stream?

867
00:57:56,369 --> 00:57:57,130
How bad is it?

868
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:00,179
It's not that bad.

869
00:58:00,219 --> 00:58:00,539
Okay.

870
00:58:00,579 --> 00:58:01,260
It's actually fine.

871
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:01,579
Okay.

872
00:58:01,579 --> 00:58:01,699
Okay.

873
00:58:01,699 --> 00:58:01,940
Okay.

874
00:58:02,539 --> 00:58:14,670
It's fine.

875
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:18,820
I wonder how bad it'll get like vampire survivors.

876
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:26,650
I got one more minute of growth and then I'm going to focus on just trying to get

877
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:28,010
points with the big one and the metal.

878
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:34,539
There you go.

879
00:58:42,909 --> 00:58:43,750
Uh, all right.

880
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:45,030
We're, we're pretty much done with growth.

881
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:53,039
800,000.

882
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,239
This is an electric guitar.

883
00:59:06,639 --> 00:59:07,400
Why is it darker?

884
00:59:08,599 --> 00:59:10,159
Oh, one of the lights is out.

885
00:59:10,679 --> 00:59:10,960
Hold on.

886
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,679
Did I do that?

887
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,039
I think I knocked a light out.

888
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:23,920
All right.

889
00:59:24,039 --> 00:59:25,920
It's time to focus on a million.

890
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:39,869
Let's make sure everything on the ground is moving pretty much.

891
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:40,230
All right.

892
00:59:44,309 --> 00:59:45,070
Whoa.

893
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:47,570
That had a, I broke the radio.

894
00:59:48,909 --> 00:59:49,309
Oh shit.

895
00:59:49,309 --> 00:59:49,909
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

896
00:59:49,989 --> 00:59:50,670
What do I give this to?

897
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:55,360
Who should eat that?

898
01:00:00,159 --> 01:00:00,599
Pixel.

899
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:01,079
All right.

900
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,880
Where's pixel duck over here?

901
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:16,280
Oh, is it, is it going to be, what's it's worth now?

902
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,039
Like the rainbow.

903
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:18,360
All right.

904
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,679
Um, is it going to do, is it going to bounce around like the Nyan cat or no?

905
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:22,969
It's just worth a lot.

906
01:00:29,889 --> 01:00:30,690
It's probably worth a lot.

907
01:00:33,969 --> 01:00:34,170
All right.

908
01:00:34,329 --> 01:00:35,849
Focus on hitting big one.

909
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:43,269
Throw the bomb up.

910
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:47,289
Yeah.

911
01:00:47,289 --> 01:00:48,090
I can't reach that far.

912
01:00:49,619 --> 01:00:50,820
The roof is still not broken.

913
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:50,940
Yeah.

914
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:51,900
I can't reach this far though.

915
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:00,630
Skeleton.

916
01:01:13,909 --> 01:01:17,159
Wait, is that, that's not a fire.

917
01:01:17,159 --> 01:01:17,440
Is it?

918
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:18,920
It's not like a candlelight.

919
01:01:20,349 --> 01:01:20,989
Is that a candle?

920
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:24,820
Wait, this thing's smoking now.

921
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:27,510
Does this count as a fire?

922
01:01:34,139 --> 01:01:35,019
That might count as a fire.

923
01:01:51,079 --> 01:01:52,400
Wait, maybe I can throw this to the roof.

924
01:01:55,909 --> 01:01:57,110
I might be able to make it to the roof with that.

925
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:02,940
Ah, oh shit.

926
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:03,500
I almost had it.

927
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:09,010
Damn it.

928
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,000
That's hitting it.

929
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:23,860
Oh, somebody said, maybe I can do this.

930
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:28,739
Place this and maybe throw something heavy at it and smush it.

931
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:42,730
I don't think that's going to work.

932
01:02:44,119 --> 01:02:45,199
It's a couple of good direct hits.

933
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:47,139
Break the other lights.

934
01:02:49,969 --> 01:02:50,889
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

935
01:02:50,889 --> 01:02:51,449
This is important.

936
01:02:52,679 --> 01:02:53,800
I'm almost at a million subs.

937
01:02:54,639 --> 01:02:55,760
Get, get out of my way.

938
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:56,760
This is my moment.

939
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:00,800
I was at a million subs guys.

940
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:19,389
I was here.

941
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:25,860
I need to unmute for this.

942
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:28,900
Did I unmute?

943
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:40,750
No, I'm going to miss it.

944
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:41,190
I'm going to miss it.

945
01:03:44,719 --> 01:03:45,920
No, I'm going to actually miss it.

946
01:03:57,179 --> 01:04:05,860
One million subscribers.

947
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:06,539
Something's happening now.

948
01:04:09,519 --> 01:04:09,719
All right.

949
01:04:09,719 --> 01:04:11,559
We need to turn this off, this music off.

950
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:14,710
What is going on right now?

951
01:04:16,159 --> 01:04:16,679
Turn the volume up.

952
01:04:24,329 --> 01:04:25,010
Did I just beat the game?

953
01:04:32,650 --> 01:04:33,170
I can't move.

954
01:04:46,639 --> 01:04:47,039
I just won.

955
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,000
I can't move.

956
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,199
I think I have to catch them.

957
01:04:58,809 --> 01:04:59,090
He's coming.

958
01:04:59,090 --> 01:05:00,369
He's actually walking towards me.

959
01:05:05,809 --> 01:05:06,610
Shit, he's coming.

960
01:05:10,519 --> 01:05:12,039
Is this going to do like a five minutes at Freddy's?

961
01:05:12,039 --> 01:05:14,719
Like, if I'm just, I'm warning you, it probably will.

962
01:05:15,159 --> 01:05:16,199
We're probably there right now.

963
01:05:16,199 --> 01:05:17,840
You jump scare probably incoming.

964
01:05:30,590 --> 01:05:30,909
What?

965
01:05:31,349 --> 01:05:32,469
I didn't beat it.

966
01:05:33,989 --> 01:05:34,469
The end.

967
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:36,170
The game just turned off.

968
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:45,349
I got the, no, that was the good ending.

969
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:46,269
I said, good ending.

970
01:05:52,039 --> 01:05:53,039
How do I get the bad ending?

971
01:05:56,820 --> 01:06:00,059
You had this open for 15 minutes before your stream.

972
01:06:04,349 --> 01:06:04,630
Yeah.

973
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:07,630
Cause I had, I was like getting my stream ready.

974
01:06:09,969 --> 01:06:13,969
And it was just sitting on the menu because I was like, I had to get my stream ready.

975
01:06:13,969 --> 01:06:14,929
I had to, you have something to eat.

976
01:06:15,570 --> 01:06:16,849
I didn't want to just close everything.

977
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:19,320
All right.

978
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:20,840
So how do I get the other endings?

979
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,000
I need to open that thing up there.

980
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,760
You need to, okay.

981
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:29,440
Skeleton duck.

982
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:31,239
But how do I open this thing?

983
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:33,360
I don't know how I need to blow up the wall too.

984
01:06:35,289 --> 01:06:35,570
All right.

985
01:06:35,610 --> 01:06:36,210
Blow the wall up.

986
01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:36,730
That's important.

987
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:41,659
Okay.

988
01:06:41,659 --> 01:06:42,380
How do I do that?

989
01:06:43,159 --> 01:06:44,000
I need the bomb.

990
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:46,840
There are multiple endings.

991
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:51,840
Apparently I want to get at least a couple of them.

992
01:06:53,809 --> 01:06:54,929
Upgrade the skeleton all the way.

993
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,480
But I might have to do a new game for that though.

994
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:04,449
All right.

995
01:07:04,449 --> 01:07:05,210
Where's bomb duck?

996
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:07,170
How do I light bomb duck?

997
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:24,519
Break the radio on bomb duck sparks from the light.

998
01:07:28,409 --> 01:07:29,570
Yeah, we'll get, let's break all the lights.

999
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:38,300
How do I get more force?

1000
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:45,159
Do I have to do it with the gold one?

1001
01:07:50,329 --> 01:07:58,840
Maybe I have to get some, get some air stand on the box.

1002
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:08,280
Oh wait.

1003
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:08,800
I know what you mean.

1004
01:08:16,649 --> 01:08:16,970
Okay.

1005
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:21,659
Damn it.

1006
01:08:25,949 --> 01:08:27,149
Can you smash the screen?

1007
01:08:27,149 --> 01:08:28,109
Smash the screen.

1008
01:08:28,390 --> 01:08:28,630
Hold on.

1009
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:29,430
Wait, that might actually work.

1010
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:40,029
I broke it.

1011
01:08:43,109 --> 01:08:43,590
What did that do?

1012
01:08:52,909 --> 01:08:53,670
I want to open that.

1013
01:08:53,670 --> 01:08:54,789
I want to open the ceiling panel.

1014
01:09:00,529 --> 01:09:01,489
Wall panels might do it.

1015
01:09:01,729 --> 01:09:02,810
That's a good idea.

1016
01:09:15,210 --> 01:09:16,409
Stop knocking it out of my hand.

1017
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:24,340
Stop.

1018
01:09:31,699 --> 01:09:32,500
This might be fire.

1019
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:34,579
It actually might be, but how did I break it before?

1020
01:09:37,329 --> 01:09:38,250
I'm going to start over.

1021
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:44,350
Try to make a spark with the metal one on.

1022
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:45,079
Yeah.

1023
01:09:45,079 --> 01:09:45,720
I tried that before.

1024
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:46,319
It didn't really work.

1025
01:09:50,579 --> 01:09:51,140
Start over.

1026
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:54,640
Smash the radio with the metal.

1027
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:05,939
Oh shit.

1028
01:10:05,939 --> 01:10:06,180
Shit.

1029
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:06,340
Okay.

1030
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:06,619
I got one.

1031
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:06,899
I got one.

1032
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:08,380
Now who do I give this to?

1033
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:11,149
The bone?

1034
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:18,560
It's not there yet.

1035
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,300
Do I get any more?

1036
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:25,619
Um, do I get any more juice to give to the bone duck?

1037
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:31,020
Bomb?

1038
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,380
Uh, I can't, I can't give it to the bomb.

1039
01:10:32,899 --> 01:10:34,020
The bomb doesn't take it.

1040
01:10:41,319 --> 01:10:42,199
You might have to restart.

1041
01:10:43,319 --> 01:10:44,439
I think you get one more.

1042
01:10:49,319 --> 01:10:51,319
You have to smash the radio when it's off.

1043
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:05,810
You would think this would work.

1044
01:11:14,029 --> 01:11:14,310
All right.

1045
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,329
I got one more for the bone.

1046
01:11:18,439 --> 01:11:19,840
Ooh, now what?

1047
01:11:20,279 --> 01:11:20,960
What does this do now?

1048
01:11:30,479 --> 01:11:31,520
Maybe I can break the panels now.

1049
01:11:37,949 --> 01:11:39,109
I can't remove the panels with this.

1050
01:11:42,439 --> 01:11:43,560
It's just really cool looking.

1051
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:45,520
Smash the radio more.

1052
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,359
I feel like a caveman.

1053
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:11,199
I don't think so.

1054
01:12:21,239 --> 01:12:22,439
I got to get that panel off.

1055
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:25,520
Maybe I shouldn't have upgraded the duck.

1056
01:12:26,279 --> 01:12:28,199
I think I, all right, hear me out on this.

1057
01:12:30,489 --> 01:12:35,250
I might have to start over to get the small duck to break the lights and

1058
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:36,449
break the panel off the ceiling.

1059
01:12:39,890 --> 01:12:40,409
You know what I mean?

1060
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:43,619
The metal duck will create sparks.

1061
01:12:43,779 --> 01:12:47,859
I can't get it.

1062
01:12:52,489 --> 01:12:53,409
God help us.

1063
01:12:59,050 --> 01:13:00,529
Use the angel for the ceiling.

1064
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:02,560
Does it have enough weight?

1065
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,039
I'm not sure this has enough weight.

1066
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:19,680
Break the angel maybe?

1067
01:13:21,069 --> 01:13:21,869
That's not a bad idea.

1068
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:29,319
Oh, that was a direct hit.

1069
01:13:32,039 --> 01:13:32,720
That was a direct hit.

1070
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:33,840
Smash the button.

1071
01:13:35,359 --> 01:13:35,800
Good idea.

1072
01:13:51,319 --> 01:13:53,119
Smash that like button.

1073
01:13:55,319 --> 01:13:56,399
Press it a hundred times.

1074
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:13,539
Oh, what just came out?

1075
01:14:15,079 --> 01:14:15,439
What was that?

1076
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:16,399
I heard something come out.

1077
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:19,619
What is that?

1078
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:22,319
Potato?

1079
01:14:22,319 --> 01:14:23,119
Like a baked potato.

1080
01:14:23,159 --> 01:14:23,720
Ooh, wood.

1081
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:24,279
This is wood.

1082
01:14:24,279 --> 01:14:25,079
Wood makes fire.

1083
01:14:25,079 --> 01:14:26,600
Fire makes electricity.

1084
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:27,960
Electricity makes currents.

1085
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:29,760
Currents allows for a bomb to be lit.

1086
01:14:31,670 --> 01:14:31,909
Okay.

1087
01:14:31,909 --> 01:14:32,270
Here we go.

1088
01:14:44,539 --> 01:14:44,979
Come on.

1089
01:14:44,979 --> 01:14:45,739
I need a spark.

1090
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:00,680
This has to work.

1091
01:15:02,119 --> 01:15:03,560
How could I, how would this not light on fire?

1092
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:05,500
You need fire.

1093
01:15:05,579 --> 01:15:07,100
I need a fire duck.

1094
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:14,640
Wait, what if we put the fire, the wood right on top of the vent here?

1095
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:16,529
Can we like roast it?

1096
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:17,649
Like a marshmallow kind of?

1097
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:31,289
No, we need, we need a duck that's on fire.

1098
01:15:38,529 --> 01:15:40,609
So the way that you're problem solving is concerning.

1099
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,479
Dude, it's a, it's a duck game.

1100
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,239
I'm not changing a tire.

1101
01:16:01,210 --> 01:16:02,130
You were right the first time.

1102
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:02,649
Restart.

1103
01:16:03,170 --> 01:16:03,689
Fire.

1104
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:04,210
Okay.

1105
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:04,529
All right.

1106
01:16:04,569 --> 01:16:05,649
Well, you have to, we're restarting.

1107
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:09,829
It's a lot of ducks I haven't seen yet.

1108
01:16:12,689 --> 01:16:12,890
All right.

1109
01:16:12,890 --> 01:16:13,890
We'll get, we're going to restart.

1110
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:16,359
New game.

1111
01:16:22,590 --> 01:16:23,750
Stop bullying Jerma.

1112
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:24,390
Stop.

1113
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:25,550
What the heck did I do?

1114
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:29,180
Thank you.

1115
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:32,199
You've ruined it.

1116
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:33,239
I don't think I did.

1117
01:16:33,729 --> 01:16:34,689
I had the, okay.

1118
01:16:34,689 --> 01:16:37,670
That metal duck was small enough for me to throw.

1119
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:43,079
I think I need to use the metal duck to break that panel and break the lights.

1120
01:16:45,279 --> 01:16:46,319
Oh shit.

1121
01:16:48,869 --> 01:16:49,630
I can get them back.

1122
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:55,880
I'm not getting to a million again.

1123
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,420
I just want to see, I want to see what's behind the panels.

1124
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:00,300
We, I want to see the content.

1125
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:09,199
That's a good strategy for the beginning.

1126
01:17:14,869 --> 01:17:32,710
It's kind of very gently.

1127
01:17:32,710 --> 01:17:33,789
You got to get, here we go right here.

1128
01:17:33,829 --> 01:17:34,949
And then just shake.

1129
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:55,869
This gives us the metal one.

1130
01:17:55,869 --> 01:17:56,149
No.

1131
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:56,960
All right.

1132
01:17:58,199 --> 01:17:59,079
I don't want to use that.

1133
01:17:59,319 --> 01:17:59,720
Okay.

1134
01:17:59,720 --> 01:17:59,960
Okay.

1135
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:01,680
Keep all the power-ups in the corner.

1136
01:18:03,829 --> 01:18:05,590
Cause I don't want to use them until later.

1137
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:37,300
So now, wood, you get the wood duck.

1138
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:38,020
Oh, that's right.

1139
01:18:57,220 --> 01:18:57,539
All right.

1140
01:18:57,539 --> 01:18:58,260
Wood duck.

1141
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:03,810
Upgrade the wood.

1142
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:04,649
Let's see what happens.

1143
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:13,460
Nothing.

1144
01:19:13,659 --> 01:19:16,439
No upgrade for the wood duck.

1145
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:20,619
Okay.

1146
01:19:20,619 --> 01:19:22,060
Well, how much is the wood duck worth?

1147
01:19:23,239 --> 01:19:23,920
Nothing.

1148
01:19:30,569 --> 01:19:31,090
Nothing.

1149
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:34,949
All right.

1150
01:19:34,949 --> 01:19:36,229
Well, we have to stay with the strategy.

1151
01:19:37,069 --> 01:19:38,109
Strat's going to stay the same.

1152
01:19:46,119 --> 01:19:46,520
What was that?

1153
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,680
Look at the above.

1154
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:56,579
Wait, what if we get to one, three, five, six and just don't do anything?

1155
01:20:00,449 --> 01:20:01,010
Does that make sense?

1156
01:20:05,159 --> 01:20:06,319
One, three, five, six.

1157
01:20:06,319 --> 01:20:06,760
And then I'm done.

1158
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:07,359
Right.

1159
01:20:07,359 --> 01:20:08,119
I know I'm going to see what happens.

1160
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:11,640
That's worth two.

1161
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:11,840
All right.

1162
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,560
We're going to do the wiggle strat.

1163
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:13,760
Yep.

1164
01:20:36,930 --> 01:20:37,210
Right.

1165
01:20:37,489 --> 01:20:37,930
This is the one.

1166
01:20:45,279 --> 01:20:45,520
All right.

1167
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:46,520
Keep that power up.

1168
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,359
I probably want all of them over here.

1169
01:20:50,039 --> 01:20:50,760
I have two right now.

1170
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:51,479
Don't let me forget that.

1171
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:51,920
Cause I will.

1172
01:20:55,409 --> 01:21:15,439
One, three, five, six, seven 52.

1173
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:19,439
I don't, I don't want anybody bouncing around right now.

1174
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,199
Use the bottom tri corner.

1175
01:21:31,869 --> 01:21:34,390
I think I can't really crouch, but that actually worked pretty well.

1176
01:21:43,369 --> 01:21:43,970
I wish I could crouch.

1177
01:21:46,489 --> 01:21:47,449
What's your favorite pasta sauce?

1178
01:21:48,010 --> 01:21:49,010
Uh, that varies.

1179
01:21:49,779 --> 01:21:51,699
Sometimes it's like a tomato, garlic, basil.

1180
01:21:51,939 --> 01:21:56,159
Sometimes it's, um, nothing at all.

1181
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:56,600
Actually.

1182
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,720
A lot of times it's actually just olive oil and a little bit of salt.

1183
01:21:59,449 --> 01:22:00,130
A little bit of pepper.

1184
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:04,279
That's probably actually my favorite way to eat it.

1185
01:22:05,039 --> 01:22:09,380
My favorite way to eat pasta is just a little bit of olive oil and a little bit

1186
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:14,319
of salt and pepper, maybe sprinkle a little bit of Parmesan, but not necessarily.

1187
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:17,760
Pesto is amazing too.

1188
01:22:29,159 --> 01:22:30,600
Butter, buttered noodles.

1189
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:37,909
Andy, I would like for all of you to just look up pasta and olive oil and

1190
01:22:37,909 --> 01:22:39,909
understand that that is a classic dish.

1191
01:22:39,949 --> 01:22:42,989
That is not, that is not like a children's menu dish.

1192
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,159
You actually need to look into that because you've got that wrong.

1193
01:22:51,989 --> 01:22:53,350
This is really upsetting him.

1194
01:22:57,449 --> 01:22:57,770
All right.

1195
01:22:57,770 --> 01:22:59,689
One, three, five, six.

1196
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:10,560
Stop bouncing around.

1197
01:23:13,289 --> 01:23:13,449
Yeah.

1198
01:23:13,449 --> 01:23:17,369
I really, a nice olive oil pasta.

1199
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:19,239
Not a whole lot either.

1200
01:23:19,239 --> 01:23:20,000
Just, just enough to get it.

1201
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,800
A little bit, just like a touch of salt.

1202
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:00,079
He's having fun.

1203
01:24:00,319 --> 01:24:02,359
Actually, I am actually having a lot of fun.

1204
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:10,560
All right.

1205
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:11,079
Wait a minute.

1206
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:12,720
How many bounces does it do?

1207
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:18,989
If I just let it go like right here, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1208
01:24:19,029 --> 01:24:19,789
Oh my God.

1209
01:24:19,789 --> 01:24:21,229
This is going to be fucking horrible.

1210
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:01,319
Did I get it?

1211
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:04,640
I don't know what happened.

1212
01:25:05,119 --> 01:25:06,119
I don't understand what I was supposed to do.

1213
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:18,840
What did I, what did I do wrong?

1214
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:19,479
Nothing happened.

1215
01:25:21,739 --> 01:25:24,500
You understood you just messed it up, but what did I do?

1216
01:25:26,369 --> 01:25:27,489
I have to actually restart it.

1217
01:25:29,029 --> 01:25:29,909
You were impatient.

1218
01:25:31,659 --> 01:25:34,539
Do I just stand in the middle of the room at one, three, five, six.

1219
01:25:35,869 --> 01:25:37,029
You need to click the button.

1220
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:41,899
It just gave you, it just made the button green.

1221
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:42,539
All right.

1222
01:25:42,539 --> 01:25:46,649
Did it actually even do anything or am I being gas lit?

1223
01:26:01,229 --> 01:26:01,949
3000.

1224
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:04,800
All right.

1225
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,479
Keep these.

1226
01:26:08,789 --> 01:26:09,829
You lost an upgrade.

1227
01:26:09,909 --> 01:26:12,079
Where's the, where's the other one?

1228
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:14,239
Did this thing eat it?

1229
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:21,000
Okay.

1230
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:27,430
Um, I want the metal duck, so let's just go ahead and hang out and talk about

1231
01:26:27,430 --> 01:26:28,630
pasta for a little bit of minutes.

1232
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:29,779
All right.

1233
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:36,579
Uh, so there's the metal one right there.

1234
01:26:39,979 --> 01:26:40,220
All right.

1235
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:40,539
Cool.

1236
01:26:40,659 --> 01:26:41,260
Perfect.

1237
01:26:48,939 --> 01:26:49,460
Nice.

1238
01:26:49,579 --> 01:26:49,859
Okay.

1239
01:26:49,859 --> 01:26:51,220
There's electricity up there now.

1240
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:55,819
I think that means bomb, but let's break everything.

1241
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:57,479
What happens when I do this?

1242
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:04,529
You stupid piece of shit.

1243
01:27:04,529 --> 01:27:05,529
You actually got into the corner.

1244
01:27:05,529 --> 01:27:07,930
You viewed the DVD menu thing, hit the corner.

1245
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:08,970
It's impossible.

1246
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:17,079
That's exactly why I placed it all over there.

1247
01:27:23,029 --> 01:27:23,189
All right.

1248
01:27:23,189 --> 01:27:23,869
What happens when I do this?

1249
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:29,430
Okay.

1250
01:27:29,430 --> 01:27:30,149
That's kind of creepy.

1251
01:27:35,739 --> 01:27:36,539
Don't touch that.

1252
01:27:54,250 --> 01:27:54,609
Okay.

1253
01:27:56,510 --> 01:27:56,869
Now what?

1254
01:28:02,220 --> 01:28:02,659
What was that?

1255
01:28:05,390 --> 01:28:06,989
It's like Satan duck.

1256
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:12,079
I feed it.

1257
01:28:14,829 --> 01:28:15,909
I'm going to feed the Satan duck.

1258
01:28:21,420 --> 01:28:21,819
You can't.

1259
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:27,239
Okay.

1260
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:28,880
So what's the point of this though?

1261
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:35,010
Now I'll get the angel duck.

1262
01:28:37,909 --> 01:28:38,789
Um, okay.

1263
01:28:38,989 --> 01:28:40,909
Angel duck is just any points, right?

1264
01:28:50,039 --> 01:28:51,119
What gives a lot of points?

1265
01:28:52,039 --> 01:28:53,359
I got to catch the, uh, all right.

1266
01:28:53,359 --> 01:28:54,399
This is going to be unbearable.

1267
01:28:54,399 --> 01:28:57,119
I'm apologize already, but we have to do this for a minute.

1268
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:00,720
Uh, I need to grab that and go into the corner and just do the wiggle.

1269
01:29:03,479 --> 01:29:04,319
I need bone duck.

1270
01:29:04,359 --> 01:29:04,760
Oh, yep.

1271
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:04,880
Yep.

1272
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:05,039
Yep.

1273
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:05,239
Yep.

1274
01:29:05,239 --> 01:29:05,439
Yep.

1275
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:10,279
What corner is it in?

1276
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:13,680
Thank God.

1277
01:29:23,260 --> 01:29:28,470
Hey, this bone green button.

1278
01:29:32,949 --> 01:29:34,989
Do not do not do not do not.

1279
01:29:35,189 --> 01:29:35,710
Here we go.

1280
01:29:36,779 --> 01:29:37,539
I think I have enough to do it.

1281
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:37,779
Don't I?

1282
01:29:38,180 --> 01:29:41,229
The three or four are angel duck.

1283
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:43,510
And I have the Satan duck.

1284
01:29:44,149 --> 01:29:45,069
What happens when I put them together?

1285
01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:02,689
Nothing so far.

1286
01:30:10,149 --> 01:30:11,069
I'm glad I have light though.

1287
01:30:11,069 --> 01:30:12,109
Let's put it like right in the middle.

1288
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:19,399
All right.

1289
01:30:19,399 --> 01:30:20,279
There's a blue.

1290
01:30:25,109 --> 01:30:26,710
Hold the bad one.

1291
01:30:26,909 --> 01:30:27,270
Hold on.

1292
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:35,760
Oh shit.

1293
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:36,920
You make them evil.

1294
01:30:38,039 --> 01:30:42,039
Wait, can you do that with the angel duck too?

1295
01:30:51,479 --> 01:30:53,840
You can.

1296
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:56,029
What is it doing?

1297
01:30:57,079 --> 01:30:58,720
Is it making them just regular size?

1298
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:06,789
That's an original duck.

1299
01:31:06,789 --> 01:31:16,649
Now make it the King evil.

1300
01:31:17,289 --> 01:31:19,920
Can I even upgrade wrong duck?

1301
01:31:28,329 --> 01:31:30,050
I wish I could see anything.

1302
01:31:30,369 --> 01:31:34,399
Okay.

1303
01:31:34,479 --> 01:31:35,800
So wait, get over here.

1304
01:31:36,159 --> 01:31:36,800
Does it not do anything?

1305
01:31:42,659 --> 01:31:43,819
Read the duck decks.

1306
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:48,100
Dark duck.

1307
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:50,239
Bomb duck.

1308
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:52,600
Holy duck.

1309
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:55,359
Skeleton duck.

1310
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,239
Still missing a few.

1311
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Extra large duck.

1312
01:32:01,739 --> 01:32:02,779
16 bit duck.

1313
01:32:04,210 --> 01:32:05,010
Holy duck.

1314
01:32:06,119 --> 01:32:07,079
Isn't that the one I already have though?

1315
01:32:08,439 --> 01:32:10,800
Read, read.

1316
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:12,529
I can't like open this.

1317
01:32:15,130 --> 01:32:16,050
Throw the wood at the wire.

1318
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:18,600
I don't want to throw the wood at the wire until I have the bomb.

1319
01:32:27,039 --> 01:32:27,560
That makes sense.

1320
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:27,840
Doesn't it?

1321
01:32:36,090 --> 01:32:37,649
If I light it right now, will it stay on fire?

1322
01:32:45,239 --> 01:32:45,800
Oh shit.

1323
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:46,760
I don't even know what the panel is.

1324
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:52,020
Not that side.

1325
01:32:58,090 --> 01:32:59,770
Evil duck is removing points.

1326
01:32:59,810 --> 01:33:00,250
That's all right.

1327
01:33:05,890 --> 01:33:06,130
All right.

1328
01:33:06,130 --> 01:33:07,289
This is all right.

1329
01:33:07,289 --> 01:33:07,970
Here's bomb duck.

1330
01:33:08,949 --> 01:33:10,710
I need to take a second because I need light.

1331
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:13,300
Where's the bomb panel.

1332
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:19,600
I think it's, I just got hit in the head in like real life.

1333
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:22,319
That felt like, okay, there's this panel.

1334
01:33:23,779 --> 01:33:26,500
The other panel is on the other side, right?

1335
01:33:38,439 --> 01:33:39,520
Where is this panel?

1336
01:33:42,699 --> 01:33:43,659
Where is the panel?

1337
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:52,500
What side is the panel on above the button?

1338
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:02,020
Does that work?

1339
01:34:06,949 --> 01:34:08,270
Hey dude, do you want to see the burrito?

1340
01:34:09,069 --> 01:34:10,789
Um, I'm sure it's delicious, but I'm good.

1341
01:34:10,789 --> 01:34:11,229
Thanks man.

1342
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:13,000
There it is.

1343
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:13,199
Okay.

1344
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:13,479
I see.

1345
01:34:20,479 --> 01:34:20,960
Is that it?

1346
01:34:26,479 --> 01:34:28,340
I should have broke this before.

1347
01:34:55,939 --> 01:34:57,939
I wanted to place that there for some marker.

1348
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:02,439
Got it.

1349
01:35:04,899 --> 01:35:05,220
Okay.

1350
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:06,100
Wood duck.

1351
01:35:10,090 --> 01:35:10,890
Where's wooden duck?

1352
01:35:12,090 --> 01:35:13,289
Wooden duck is right here.

1353
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:16,439
Light wooden duck on fire.

1354
01:35:17,039 --> 01:35:17,800
And then hold on.

1355
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:18,520
It's a button to press.

1356
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:22,569
Okay.

1357
01:35:22,850 --> 01:35:24,840
Put that in the corner over here.

1358
01:35:27,079 --> 01:35:27,279
Okay.

1359
01:35:27,279 --> 01:35:28,920
Where's that bomb panel?

1360
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:30,319
It's right here.

1361
01:35:39,439 --> 01:35:40,000
Get over here.

1362
01:35:48,430 --> 01:35:48,670
All right.

1363
01:35:48,710 --> 01:35:49,430
There it is.

1364
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:51,079
Place.

1365
01:35:51,199 --> 01:35:52,279
Can you place that a throw?

1366
01:36:02,810 --> 01:36:03,729
I don't think you can place.

1367
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,840
I'd like for it to end up hanging out in the corner over there though.

1368
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:08,739
Oh, whatever.

1369
01:36:08,739 --> 01:36:09,260
I know where it is.

1370
01:36:09,260 --> 01:36:09,699
Just give me.

1371
01:36:20,140 --> 01:36:21,140
I can't just let go of it.

1372
01:36:23,909 --> 01:36:26,789
And when you let go of it, you just whip it against the wall as hard as you can.

1373
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:31,359
Is it off?

1374
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:39,439
Okay.

1375
01:36:39,439 --> 01:36:39,880
It's off.

1376
01:36:40,739 --> 01:36:43,760
Now I need to, I have to place this here.

1377
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:47,399
Like I have to just figure out how to get stuck.

1378
01:36:49,979 --> 01:36:51,100
It just bounces way too much.

1379
01:36:54,079 --> 01:36:54,920
We're gonna have to just guess.

1380
01:36:58,100 --> 01:36:58,260
All right.

1381
01:36:58,260 --> 01:36:58,739
Where's the wood?

1382
01:37:13,210 --> 01:37:13,569
Okay.

1383
01:37:13,609 --> 01:37:14,329
Let's light that.

1384
01:37:17,079 --> 01:37:18,079
Actually leave that there.

1385
01:37:18,359 --> 01:37:23,689
I'm going to put the bomb right here as close as I can get to this.

1386
01:37:23,689 --> 01:37:26,279
Cause it's going to fall and then I need to light it.

1387
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:27,840
So it's right next to it.

1388
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:28,039
Okay.

1389
01:37:28,039 --> 01:37:28,640
It's right here.

1390
01:37:29,399 --> 01:37:30,239
That's probably too close.

1391
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:47,640
Is it not going to work?

1392
01:37:52,359 --> 01:37:52,800
Oh shit.

1393
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:53,199
Oh shit.

1394
01:37:53,199 --> 01:37:53,560
Oh shit.

1395
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:53,880
Oh shit.

1396
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:54,119
Okay.

1397
01:37:54,119 --> 01:37:54,319
Okay.

1398
01:37:54,319 --> 01:37:54,600
Okay.

1399
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:55,600
Where's the bomb?

1400
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:56,850
Where's the bomb?

1401
01:37:58,369 --> 01:37:59,090
Where's the bomb?

1402
01:37:59,689 --> 01:38:00,449
It's the bomb.

1403
01:38:01,770 --> 01:38:03,369
How long is that on fire for?

1404
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:06,439
Get over here.

1405
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:07,159
Where's the bomb?

1406
01:38:13,319 --> 01:38:13,520
Where?

1407
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:16,340
Oh my God.

1408
01:38:16,340 --> 01:38:17,500
You stupid fucking thing.

1409
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:18,899
I hate that Nyan cat thing.

1410
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:20,619
You just ruined everything.

1411
01:38:22,159 --> 01:38:22,680
Where is it now?

1412
01:38:24,789 --> 01:38:25,390
Oh my God.

1413
01:38:25,390 --> 01:38:26,390
Get out of my way.

1414
01:38:35,239 --> 01:38:35,920
Where did it go?

1415
01:38:41,779 --> 01:38:42,220
All right.

1416
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:44,600
Stop right there.

1417
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:46,239
It's directly across.

1418
01:38:46,439 --> 01:38:47,000
No, it's not.

1419
01:38:50,159 --> 01:38:51,520
It's a little bit to the left.

1420
01:38:53,039 --> 01:38:53,560
All right, here we go.

1421
01:38:54,319 --> 01:38:58,779
I need to grab the bomb because it's right here.

1422
01:38:59,180 --> 01:39:00,420
It's not directly across.

1423
01:39:08,020 --> 01:39:08,619
Where did it go?

1424
01:39:08,939 --> 01:39:11,739
Did that stupid Nyan cat thing fucking knock it out of the way?

1425
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:13,380
I hate that thing so much.

1426
01:39:14,579 --> 01:39:15,500
I don't even know where it is now.

1427
01:39:17,529 --> 01:39:18,369
Where did you knock it?

1428
01:39:27,079 --> 01:39:28,319
Well, here's the bomb.

1429
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:31,020
Oh my, give it to me.

1430
01:39:31,060 --> 01:39:32,060
Oh my God.

1431
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:42,880
I'm I hate this game.

1432
01:39:52,899 --> 01:39:54,699
Give me my panel back.

1433
01:39:58,939 --> 01:40:00,380
I need one light panel.

1434
01:40:05,439 --> 01:40:06,279
Is it, is it lit?

1435
01:40:06,479 --> 01:40:06,680
All right.

1436
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:07,039
It's lit.

1437
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:15,399
What is this?

1438
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:16,760
This is a purple duck.

1439
01:40:17,079 --> 01:40:17,640
Oh, it's pink.

1440
01:40:31,399 --> 01:40:32,319
Where are you?

1441
01:40:33,409 --> 01:40:33,649
Okay.

1442
01:40:33,649 --> 01:40:34,250
There he is.

1443
01:40:34,369 --> 01:40:35,090
Now, wait a minute.

1444
01:40:35,989 --> 01:40:37,069
Right across here.

1445
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:43,270
I have to, oh my God.

1446
01:40:50,149 --> 01:40:50,989
This is going to be loud.

1447
01:40:52,199 --> 01:40:52,920
Is that the right spot?

1448
01:40:54,670 --> 01:40:55,029
I got it.

1449
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:01,920
I got it.

1450
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:02,159
I got it.

1451
01:41:02,159 --> 01:41:02,399
I got it.

1452
01:41:02,399 --> 01:41:02,680
I got it.

1453
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:02,960
I got it.

1454
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:06,640
I love this game.

1455
01:41:10,529 --> 01:41:10,729
Okay.

1456
01:41:10,729 --> 01:41:14,010
Now I can break that open with the big metal duck.

1457
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:18,680
I have power up somewhere, right?

1458
01:41:20,399 --> 01:41:21,319
Oh, do I need a key?

1459
01:41:26,979 --> 01:41:27,579
Do I need a key?

1460
01:41:29,399 --> 01:41:30,600
You have a negative score.

1461
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:40,050
I just found out you ate him and this game.

1462
01:41:41,319 --> 01:41:42,600
I didn't even want to click on it.

1463
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:44,479
The Nyan cat pushed it into me.

1464
01:41:50,939 --> 01:41:51,819
Can I break it?

1465
01:41:56,229 --> 01:41:58,069
Do I actually need a key or could I break it?

1466
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:00,699
I can definitely break it, right?

1467
01:42:11,659 --> 01:42:11,899
All right.

1468
01:42:11,939 --> 01:42:12,539
Break this.

1469
01:42:24,390 --> 01:42:28,539
I can't skeleton key duck.

1470
01:42:31,180 --> 01:42:32,340
Uh, I already have this.

1471
01:42:33,100 --> 01:42:33,939
I don't have a skeleton anymore.

1472
01:42:33,939 --> 01:42:35,600
Wait, does that actually work?

1473
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:37,479
Upgrade fire.

1474
01:42:41,850 --> 01:42:44,310
Can't yeah.

1475
01:42:44,310 --> 01:42:45,229
Skeleton became angel.

1476
01:42:45,510 --> 01:42:50,500
I can't leave without, I got it.

1477
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:52,180
At least I got it.

1478
01:42:52,420 --> 01:42:53,930
I can't not open this.

1479
01:42:54,489 --> 01:42:56,569
This is like the big treasure chest of the game.

1480
01:42:57,520 --> 01:42:57,880
Burn it.

1481
01:43:04,539 --> 01:43:05,420
Upgrade the chest.

1482
01:43:06,989 --> 01:43:12,050
Oh, you need a negative score.

1483
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:14,079
All right.

1484
01:43:14,079 --> 01:43:15,079
So, all right, all right, all right.

1485
01:43:15,159 --> 01:43:15,479
Let's go.

1486
01:43:15,479 --> 01:43:15,720
Let's go.

1487
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:15,960
I got it.

1488
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:16,239
I got it.

1489
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:31,010
So we have to make a bunch of devil, um, bunch of devils and that will bring my

1490
01:43:31,010 --> 01:43:31,569
score negative.

1491
01:43:37,590 --> 01:43:38,149
Is that accurate?

1492
01:43:48,550 --> 01:43:48,750
All right.

1493
01:43:48,750 --> 01:43:49,670
This is going to take a little while.

1494
01:43:49,670 --> 01:43:50,989
So we're going to put a new OST on.

1495
01:43:50,989 --> 01:43:52,510
Can we get a recommendation?

1496
01:43:54,390 --> 01:43:57,069
Maybe make, can you make the Nyan cat want a devil?

1497
01:44:09,949 --> 01:44:10,590
I'm not sure you can.

1498
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:22,159
Now I'm not leaving until I open this box.

1499
01:44:23,060 --> 01:44:24,380
This is like the good ending.

1500
01:44:26,449 --> 01:44:28,170
Uh, I'm just going to keep making them.

1501
01:44:28,949 --> 01:44:29,630
Can I upgrade them?

1502
01:44:39,850 --> 01:44:40,250
All right.

1503
01:44:40,369 --> 01:44:40,970
Uh, yeah.

1504
01:44:40,970 --> 01:44:43,329
Mods get a, get a good four choices.

1505
01:44:52,239 --> 01:45:00,079
No, no one's forcing you to play this.

1506
01:45:00,119 --> 01:45:01,479
I, I want to play this.

1507
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:03,840
That's why I'm playing.

1508
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:12,960
I not jokingly enough want to see the end.

1509
01:45:25,460 --> 01:45:26,819
Am I, I'm not losing points though.

1510
01:45:38,779 --> 01:45:40,100
Smash the battery again.

1511
01:45:40,420 --> 01:45:41,979
Make a negative battery.

1512
01:45:47,949 --> 01:45:51,319
Uh, it sounds a little too complicated.

1513
01:45:53,460 --> 01:45:57,029
I feel like I have to restart to get to the next part, but I can't.

1514
01:45:59,420 --> 01:46:03,020
I feel like I gained way too many points with the Nyan cat one.

1515
01:46:06,149 --> 01:46:08,869
Cause I'm gonna have to sit here and make a ton of negative scoring ducks and it's

1516
01:46:08,869 --> 01:46:10,869
going to take an hour to reverse it.

1517
01:46:13,399 --> 01:46:14,199
I'm going to give it one more try.

1518
01:46:16,729 --> 01:46:17,329
The runs are ruined.

1519
01:46:17,329 --> 01:46:17,649
It's all right.

1520
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:27,640
The key is minus 50 K.

1521
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:28,000
Okay.

1522
01:46:30,239 --> 01:46:31,319
Leaving the lights on this time.

1523
01:46:37,029 --> 01:46:45,439
So this time the goal is to get, just don't break the lights.

1524
01:46:54,159 --> 01:46:54,560
Okay.

1525
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:58,640
You need to break the lights to get devil duck.

1526
01:46:59,510 --> 01:47:00,750
Oh, that's true.

1527
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:08,239
You need to break the lights eventually.

1528
01:47:09,039 --> 01:47:09,880
Hmm.

1529
01:47:14,359 --> 01:47:19,149
I think, yeah, I think I can get the wood duck first.

1530
01:47:19,229 --> 01:47:21,439
Get the bomb done out of the way.

1531
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:29,079
Yeah.

1532
01:47:29,079 --> 01:47:31,520
I'm going to, once I get the chest out, then I can figure that out.

1533
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:38,720
Bomb will come after the Nyan cat.

1534
01:47:48,439 --> 01:47:48,560
Yeah.

1535
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:53,779
Trying to not get the Nyan cat to upgrade is the real problem.

1536
01:47:56,640 --> 01:47:57,399
Where can I put this?

1537
01:47:57,399 --> 01:47:58,800
We're just maybe like behind here.

1538
01:47:58,840 --> 01:47:59,079
Okay.

1539
01:47:59,079 --> 01:47:59,720
What if I do this?

1540
01:48:01,130 --> 01:48:02,010
I'm going to make a shield.

1541
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:09,279
So it'll never, it'll always have to bounce off of this first.

1542
01:48:09,319 --> 01:48:10,479
It's not going to ever go in there.

1543
01:48:12,270 --> 01:48:13,550
We need to make a protective box.

1544
01:48:15,239 --> 01:48:17,119
So now it almost physically can't touch it.

1545
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:19,920
Okay.

1546
01:48:27,619 --> 01:48:29,460
I'm giving this one more attempt, and then I'm going to open up the

1547
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:33,409
armored core six tutorial and, um, get very angry.

1548
01:48:33,770 --> 01:48:34,369
I don't think I will.

1549
01:48:34,409 --> 01:48:34,970
I think I'll have fun.

1550
01:48:42,850 --> 01:48:43,369
Okay.

1551
01:48:44,689 --> 01:48:45,810
So what's the order?

1552
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:47,319
What do you guys think?

1553
01:48:47,319 --> 01:48:47,840
What's the order?

1554
01:48:49,180 --> 01:48:49,819
Wood duck?

1555
01:48:52,010 --> 01:48:52,970
Blow up wall.

1556
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:54,760
I got to get metal duck.

1557
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:03,760
Oh, that's a good idea.

1558
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:07,260
Hide the batteries in the, where the bone duck was.

1559
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:21,880
Break one light.

1560
01:49:22,439 --> 01:49:23,600
Make a bunch of children.

1561
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:26,319
Then once you blow up the wall, turn all the lights out to get the

1562
01:49:26,319 --> 01:49:27,399
devil and bounce them around.

1563
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:28,520
Good idea.

1564
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:29,039
Actually.

1565
01:49:29,039 --> 01:49:29,439
Great idea.

1566
01:49:50,739 --> 01:49:51,100
Okay.

1567
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:53,079
That was about right.

1568
01:49:56,859 --> 01:49:57,060
All right.

1569
01:49:57,060 --> 01:49:58,739
We got hot wheels, stunt track coming up.

1570
01:50:02,970 --> 01:50:06,680
Hot wheels, stunt track.

1571
01:50:07,079 --> 01:50:07,680
Oh, S T.

1572
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:08,680
Is this, what was this for?

1573
01:50:12,439 --> 01:50:13,359
Hot wheels, stunt track.

1574
01:50:13,890 --> 01:50:14,890
Oh, S T.

1575
01:50:17,810 --> 01:50:18,609
I think this is correct.

1576
01:50:21,060 --> 01:50:22,260
Ooh, this sounds pretty good.

1577
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:24,960
All right.

1578
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:25,560
I'm into this.

1579
01:50:32,079 --> 01:50:32,279
Cool.

1580
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:46,699
It's like rubber ducky death metal.

1581
01:50:57,229 --> 01:50:59,430
He's saying all kinds of fucked up shit right now.

1582
01:51:13,149 --> 01:51:14,350
This is not death metal.

1583
01:51:15,029 --> 01:51:16,430
He listened to this death metal.

1584
01:51:22,260 --> 01:51:23,939
You need to open poke stream right now.

1585
01:51:23,939 --> 01:51:24,859
It's very important.

1586
01:51:26,430 --> 01:51:26,710
Why?

1587
01:51:43,510 --> 01:51:50,069
This warlock thing, this warlock, this warlock, this warlock item.

1588
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,159
He's kind of doing it to the beat.

1589
01:51:59,199 --> 01:51:59,880
Oh, keep going.

1590
01:52:01,159 --> 01:52:01,960
You're cooking right now.

1591
01:52:02,619 --> 01:52:03,420
Just keep farming money.

1592
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:06,939
It's got a lot of gold and we should start investing on items.

1593
01:52:08,109 --> 01:52:10,989
Is it cheating if my viewers send me items and I buy it?

1594
01:52:11,590 --> 01:52:12,989
Respectfully, for a good price.

1595
01:52:16,750 --> 01:52:18,829
Does he have my stream up behind him?

1596
01:52:23,159 --> 01:52:25,520
It sounds like a promo for poke stream.

1597
01:52:26,970 --> 01:52:29,689
Like here's the crazy stuff that poke gets up to.

1598
01:52:36,319 --> 01:52:37,840
Oh, we've been caught.

1599
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:41,520
Jerma, did you, did you get the ducks or what?

1600
01:52:41,720 --> 01:52:42,880
Yeah, it was awesome.

1601
01:52:43,439 --> 01:52:45,560
I got to a million points and I'm still working.

1602
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:51,039
I'm still trying to figure out how to, uh, get the box open, which is pretty,

1603
01:52:51,239 --> 01:52:52,359
it's been pretty interesting so far.

1604
01:52:55,359 --> 01:52:55,520
Okay.

1605
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:56,479
I can't listen to the stream anymore.

1606
01:52:56,479 --> 01:52:57,680
Cause I'm listening to myself three times.

1607
01:52:59,829 --> 01:53:00,949
How do I get the box open?

1608
01:53:11,470 --> 01:53:12,909
I'm stealing your content right here.

1609
01:53:12,909 --> 01:53:13,989
Thanks Jerma for the content.

1610
01:53:22,510 --> 01:53:24,670
He just starts throwing shit in his room.

1611
01:53:25,189 --> 01:53:28,949
That kind of sounded like he's doing his own duck bouncing.

1612
01:53:28,989 --> 01:53:29,989
He's like, Oh, Hey, thanks.

1613
01:53:29,989 --> 01:53:31,710
I got, I got, I got some ideas now.

1614
01:53:32,069 --> 01:53:34,789
He just starts picking up shit in his room, throwing it into the walls.

1615
01:53:39,979 --> 01:53:40,899
All right, let's keep going.

1616
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:55,159
Hold on a second.

1617
01:53:55,439 --> 01:53:56,039
This is important.

1618
01:53:59,470 --> 01:54:02,829
Let's see if we can get ourselves up on the, don't, don't say anything to poke.

1619
01:54:39,239 --> 01:54:40,000
You're sweating.

1620
01:54:58,520 --> 01:55:01,079
I was not sweating this much when I played Elden Ring.

1621
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:04,520
It's just my right arm too.

1622
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:07,760
My left arm, my left underarm is perfectly fine.

1623
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:08,960
Holy shit.

1624
01:55:10,010 --> 01:55:10,369
All right.

1625
01:55:10,369 --> 01:55:11,050
Well, that was fun.

1626
01:55:13,770 --> 01:55:14,010
All right.

1627
01:55:14,010 --> 01:55:14,250
All right.

1628
01:55:14,289 --> 01:55:16,250
Stay with the, uh, stay with the, what I was doing.

1629
01:55:20,170 --> 01:55:21,329
What did I get behind him?

1630
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:30,560
Was that, did I get to be on the screen behind him?

1631
01:55:31,659 --> 01:55:31,939
Good.

1632
01:55:31,979 --> 01:55:32,420
Was it good?

1633
01:55:37,020 --> 01:55:39,539
He's in the middle of like a hard fight in dark and darker.

1634
01:55:39,539 --> 01:55:40,619
And I'm just sitting there behind him.

1635
01:55:42,270 --> 01:55:43,710
I just start smoking behind him.

1636
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:47,159
Hold on.

1637
01:55:47,159 --> 01:55:47,720
Here's the clip.

1638
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:48,159
Hold on.

1639
01:55:48,399 --> 01:55:48,800
Wait, wait, wait.

1640
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:49,279
This is important.

1641
01:55:49,279 --> 01:55:49,760
I want to see this.

1642
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:55,100
Where's the clip.

1643
01:56:07,350 --> 01:56:08,270
I got to get this on.

1644
01:56:08,789 --> 01:56:09,470
Hold on a sec.

1645
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:17,579
We got it.

1646
01:56:17,579 --> 01:56:18,859
We got to get this on the big screen.

1647
01:56:18,859 --> 01:56:19,140
Hold on.

1648
01:56:25,149 --> 01:56:26,229
Oh, where is it?

1649
01:56:28,270 --> 01:56:28,869
Okay.

1650
01:56:29,720 --> 01:56:30,199
Here we go.

1651
01:56:44,250 --> 01:56:44,810
All right, here we go.

1652
01:56:44,810 --> 01:56:45,210
Let's see.

1653
01:56:54,069 --> 01:56:55,510
Did your name's a bad look for me, man.

1654
01:56:55,789 --> 01:56:56,630
I'm just going to say it right now.

1655
01:57:07,159 --> 01:57:08,000
I don't know him.

1656
01:57:13,020 --> 01:57:14,220
That's so stupid.

1657
01:57:14,539 --> 01:57:15,060
I love it.

1658
01:57:15,579 --> 01:57:16,460
He's flipping me off.

1659
01:57:17,659 --> 01:57:19,100
Oh, you can see him like pull out.

1660
01:57:24,279 --> 01:57:25,439
Oh, that's great.

1661
01:57:27,489 --> 01:57:29,050
Oh, that's, I love that.

1662
01:57:29,250 --> 01:57:29,890
That was amazing.

1663
01:57:35,550 --> 01:57:35,869
Okay.

1664
01:57:36,789 --> 01:57:41,210
So, uh, let's get back to the game.

1665
01:57:48,310 --> 01:57:48,670
What was that?

1666
01:57:48,670 --> 01:57:50,189
What was the, I want to know what, what was I doing?

1667
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:51,760
I forget what I was doing.

1668
01:57:52,439 --> 01:57:53,000
Back to business.

1669
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:53,199
Yeah.

1670
01:57:53,359 --> 01:57:53,600
Yeah.

1671
01:57:53,640 --> 01:57:53,840
All right.

1672
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:54,199
Back to this.

1673
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:56,699
He stayed full screen after that.

1674
01:57:56,699 --> 01:57:57,539
Cause he was in the middle of it.

1675
01:58:02,779 --> 01:58:03,619
Oh, I need the music.

1676
01:58:04,359 --> 01:58:06,079
Can't just have no music on what's going on here.

1677
01:58:16,220 --> 01:58:16,579
Okay.

1678
01:58:18,039 --> 01:58:22,239
So stay with the plan.

1679
01:58:35,279 --> 01:58:37,199
I'm doing this and I'm, I, this is it.

1680
01:58:38,369 --> 01:58:44,279
I'm having fun with this, but I want to do this tutorial in armored

1681
01:58:44,279 --> 01:58:45,359
core and then turn my stream off.

1682
01:58:59,140 --> 01:59:00,220
The battery in the corner.

1683
01:59:00,260 --> 01:59:00,779
Yo.

1684
01:59:00,779 --> 01:59:01,020
Yup.

1685
01:59:01,020 --> 01:59:01,180
Yup.

1686
01:59:01,180 --> 01:59:01,340
Yup.

1687
01:59:01,340 --> 01:59:01,500
Yup.

1688
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:01,699
Yup.

1689
01:59:02,380 --> 01:59:02,939
Oh, yup.

1690
01:59:19,619 --> 01:59:24,310
We do not want that Nyan duck to touch this.

1691
01:59:24,310 --> 01:59:25,310
Hopefully this is a good spot.

1692
01:59:30,399 --> 01:59:37,640
We need the metal duck yet.

1693
01:59:37,640 --> 01:59:38,560
Wooden duck right now.

1694
01:59:39,159 --> 01:59:42,819
Um, wouldn't, what was the process to get wooden duck?

1695
01:59:42,819 --> 01:59:43,500
I need to break this.

1696
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:44,020
Let me break it.

1697
01:59:45,159 --> 01:59:45,319
Wait.

1698
01:59:45,319 --> 01:59:46,600
I can't break that without metal duck.

1699
01:59:47,510 --> 01:59:48,270
I think I have to keep going.

1700
01:59:52,250 --> 01:59:52,770
Ah, that's right.

1701
01:59:52,770 --> 01:59:53,130
It's a button.

1702
01:59:53,250 --> 01:59:53,609
Thank you.

1703
01:59:53,770 --> 01:59:54,170
Appreciate it.

1704
02:00:05,859 --> 02:00:06,260
Oh my God.

1705
02:00:06,260 --> 02:00:06,779
I've lost it.

1706
02:00:07,100 --> 02:00:07,859
Lost my touch here.

1707
02:00:15,479 --> 02:00:16,600
Looking good so far.

1708
02:00:19,770 --> 02:00:35,920
So now, now I just need to get enough points to get, uh, you know,

1709
02:00:56,800 --> 02:01:00,670
that's just putting up like fucking like Lord of the Rings.

1710
02:01:03,210 --> 02:01:04,409
Would we both get banned?

1711
02:01:24,090 --> 02:01:24,449
Okay.

1712
02:01:25,100 --> 02:01:26,140
I think we're close.

1713
02:01:28,149 --> 02:01:28,350
All right.

1714
02:01:28,350 --> 02:01:32,800
Do not bounce into the corner at all.

1715
02:01:37,199 --> 02:01:38,039
We're going to continue.

1716
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:39,399
What do you mean ruined?

1717
02:01:39,439 --> 02:01:39,680
What?

1718
02:01:43,569 --> 02:01:44,609
Upgrade the normal duck.

1719
02:01:45,329 --> 02:01:46,050
Guard the corner.

1720
02:01:46,250 --> 02:01:47,810
No, it is this it's blocked over there.

1721
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:49,039
Okay.

1722
02:01:49,039 --> 02:01:51,560
We have to, we got to hurry up because we need to start.

1723
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:53,479
We need to, we need the blue duck.

1724
02:01:56,359 --> 02:01:57,640
Then we got to get rid of all the lights.

1725
02:02:14,529 --> 02:02:15,090
Did I fuck it up?

1726
02:02:21,399 --> 02:02:22,119
Don't break this.

1727
02:02:24,590 --> 02:02:26,270
What poke stream in your corner?

1728
02:02:27,699 --> 02:02:30,869
I can't, I can't do that.

1729
02:02:35,689 --> 02:02:36,569
You just broke it.

1730
02:02:37,850 --> 02:02:39,850
I'm paying attention to too many things right now.

1731
02:02:42,170 --> 02:02:44,010
I, I need the blue duck.

1732
02:02:44,050 --> 02:02:45,329
I'm, I'm going with what I know.

1733
02:02:54,319 --> 02:02:56,600
His Sims queue is full right now.

1734
02:02:56,920 --> 02:02:58,359
You, that is a good way to put it.

1735
02:02:58,359 --> 02:02:58,840
Seriously.

1736
02:03:01,770 --> 02:03:03,050
Actually a great way to put it.

1737
02:03:04,319 --> 02:03:05,159
Did we get that way though?

1738
02:03:05,239 --> 02:03:05,680
Honestly?

1739
02:03:05,800 --> 02:03:06,600
No, like joking around.

1740
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:10,720
Okay.

1741
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:17,289
Here comes now the strategy that that chatter said, don't you dare touch that.

1742
02:03:41,470 --> 02:03:42,670
You cannot upgrade the wooden one.

1743
02:03:42,670 --> 02:03:45,560
Unfortunately, it's not upgradeable.

1744
02:03:51,550 --> 02:03:52,590
I think I need like 5,000.

1745
02:04:08,039 --> 02:04:10,079
What pokes webcam on your stream?

1746
02:04:13,220 --> 02:04:23,409
Oh, but that would mean poke would have to be full cam for me to do that.

1747
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:30,039
Hey, we'd have to be full cam pretending to play this game.

1748
02:04:31,289 --> 02:04:32,329
I don't think that's going to happen.

1749
02:04:33,090 --> 02:04:34,970
No, poke is, is playing dark and dark.

1750
02:04:34,970 --> 02:04:35,810
He's probably having a good time.

1751
02:04:38,670 --> 02:04:39,149
Crop it.

1752
02:04:39,149 --> 02:04:45,220
So you can crop it.

1753
02:04:50,819 --> 02:04:51,779
Now you've got me.

1754
02:04:51,819 --> 02:04:53,140
Now you got me interested.

1755
02:04:54,439 --> 02:04:55,199
All right.

1756
02:04:55,199 --> 02:04:55,880
Hold on.

1757
02:04:55,920 --> 02:04:56,840
This is going to take a minute.

1758
02:04:56,840 --> 02:04:57,920
Don't tell him we're doing this.

1759
02:04:57,920 --> 02:05:01,479
I know you, you guys are going to just, you guys are going to rat us out.

1760
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:22,840
Okay.

1761
02:05:22,840 --> 02:05:23,560
This is going to take a second.

1762
02:05:23,560 --> 02:05:24,359
Cause I'm going to crop it.

1763
02:05:24,479 --> 02:05:38,880
Well, you know, try to stop talking to, don't tell him I'm going to stop talking

1764
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:41,600
to, this is going to be actually fucking hilarious.

1765
02:05:41,960 --> 02:05:42,560
Hold on a second.

1766
02:05:50,869 --> 02:05:53,149
Nobody blow this because this might be very funny.

1767
02:05:54,920 --> 02:05:56,199
He's going to be talking about the game.

1768
02:05:56,239 --> 02:05:58,359
His game is going to be like, what is he talking about?

1769
02:06:00,069 --> 02:06:00,470
Okay.

1770
02:06:00,550 --> 02:06:01,029
Hold on.

1771
02:06:01,350 --> 02:06:06,819
You need this to be bigger.

1772
02:06:12,470 --> 02:06:12,949
Turn it up.

1773
02:06:17,750 --> 02:06:18,710
I have to do this quick.

1774
02:06:18,710 --> 02:06:20,909
Cause the background in his stream is going to change.

1775
02:06:27,890 --> 02:06:28,369
Okay.

1776
02:06:28,369 --> 02:06:30,850
Where is this?

1777
02:06:37,739 --> 02:06:37,979
Shit.

1778
02:06:37,979 --> 02:06:38,659
That's not the right one.

1779
02:06:42,159 --> 02:06:42,520
Okay.

1780
02:06:43,470 --> 02:06:44,229
Give me a sec.

1781
02:06:52,449 --> 02:06:54,090
It's important that nobody blows this.

1782
02:06:59,100 --> 02:06:59,739
Keep chilling.

1783
02:07:00,260 --> 02:07:01,060
You guys are doing great.

1784
02:07:01,260 --> 02:07:02,140
You guys are doing great.

1785
02:07:06,670 --> 02:07:07,909
You guys are doing great right now.

1786
02:07:07,909 --> 02:07:08,430
Just hold on.

1787
02:07:28,319 --> 02:07:28,680
Where is he?

1788
02:07:55,449 --> 02:07:56,250
Rat pendant.

1789
02:07:56,289 --> 02:07:57,850
I'm going to go for it one time, guys.

1790
02:07:59,890 --> 02:08:01,930
Wait, isn't rat resourcefulness?

1791
02:08:02,250 --> 02:08:03,609
This could be very useless, right?

1792
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:06,800
Resourcefulness could be very useless.

1793
02:08:07,869 --> 02:08:09,909
Wait, resourcefulness is that right guys?

1794
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:14,279
Yeah.

1795
02:08:14,279 --> 02:08:15,760
It's probably the worst one too.

1796
02:08:17,149 --> 02:08:21,859
But what if it's at a 900 gold, 900 gold?

1797
02:08:22,899 --> 02:08:23,340
Oh shit.

1798
02:08:23,340 --> 02:08:24,500
My food's here, guys.

1799
02:08:25,439 --> 02:08:28,239
I gotta go to a laughing face.

1800
02:08:32,810 --> 02:08:33,569
I look at my food.

1801
02:08:44,840 --> 02:08:45,119
Oh shit.

1802
02:08:45,119 --> 02:08:45,640
I can't move.

1803
02:08:45,920 --> 02:08:47,800
Oh, he's getting food.

1804
02:09:01,720 --> 02:09:02,600
He's getting food.

1805
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:03,439
We can't move.

1806
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,319
Wait, the face cam's not even right.

1807
02:09:05,439 --> 02:09:05,680
Fuck.

1808
02:09:05,680 --> 02:09:06,000
Hold on.

1809
02:09:06,159 --> 02:09:21,609
I got McDonald's.

1810
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:26,760
I turn off the blue.

1811
02:09:27,199 --> 02:09:29,520
Don't never buy no weed from the gas station, bro.

1812
02:09:29,880 --> 02:09:30,199
Wow.

1813
02:09:30,199 --> 02:09:31,760
