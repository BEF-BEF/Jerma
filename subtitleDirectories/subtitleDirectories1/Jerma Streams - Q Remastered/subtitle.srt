1
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:38,009
Why, hello there. How's it going? What's up? He's speaking. I, it's always a minute and 30

2
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:44,649
seconds after I turn the stream on. Have you noticed that? It is 90 seconds when I talk.

3
00:00:49,579 --> 00:01:00,420
Usually, what about Golem part two? No, we're not going to play Golem today. I don't think we're

4
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:08,090
going to play Golem again. Uh, I gave it a fair score of, what did I give it? I thought it was

5
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:14,549
pretty good. I gave it like a 7.6. I thought it was fine. I like the, um, the ending cut scene

6
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,189
was really cool when you shoot the lightning out of your hands at Sauron. That was a good touch.

7
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:27,290
I think a 7.6 or something. I, although I don't, I'm not like a big fan of the, uh, over the

8
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,689
shoulder kind of 3d sonic levels type shit they were doing when you run really fast up and down

9
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:35,530
the hills and you go over the loop to loops and stuff. It was kind of weird that they put it in

10
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,969
the last. The last section was probably my most favorite, but also the kind of weirdest.

11
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:51,400
Um, I think it was a 7.6. Hey, what's up? All right. Today we're just going to hang out.

12
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:59,109
I like the crafting. The crafting system was good. Yeah. I'm going to stream for like only a few

13
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:04,379
hours today. I woke up with a fucking headache and it's just one of those headaches. It just

14
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:12,199
doesn't go away. So kind of annoying. When are you going to play SpongeBob Battle for Bikini Bottom?

15
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:31,860
He's lying. That was a lie. It was not. He's lying. Only a few hours. I mean, I, I typically

16
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:38,120
stream for like five to seven, but yeah, we'll just, we'll hang out for a little while.

17
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:48,580
I want to play this game called, uh, it's called Q Remastered. Seeing some people play this seems

18
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:55,900
like a good, uh, fun puzzle experience. It's a, it is a physics based puzzle game. So what you have

19
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:03,020
to do is you have, there's a ball you have to get into a hole and you have to use your imagination

20
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,819
to get it there. They don't give you any of the tools besides your imagination.

21
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:20,360
So I'm just going to hang out and play. Will you stream for 16 hours? That's never going to happen.

22
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:30,680
I don't, I don't think I could ever do a real 24 hour stream or more than like 15.

23
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:41,270
I don't think it's possible. My energy levels burn out completely after I want to, I mean,

24
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:46,389
maybe like six hours of being on stream. I'm kind of like, I, I, I have to leave within an hour or

25
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:57,610
two. Usually eight hours is like the end. I don't know how, I don't know what superpowers some

26
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:03,129
people have where they can just be completely normal and fine on stream for like 20 plus hours.

27
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:12,550
I just can't do it. It sucks to be old. Is that what it is you think? Am I just, am I just old?

28
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:27,370
When are you going to play tears of the kingdom? I don't know. I don't know. I have to be really

29
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:32,420
honest with you. Should I be really upfront? I don't know if I'm ever going to play tears of

30
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:42,579
the kingdom. I just don't know. Right. I don't, I can't say the answer is yes. I know everyone's

31
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:50,180
very upset now and everyone's very unhappy with me, but I just, maybe eventually there's other

32
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:57,829
things I want to do first. And in the priority list, it sounds really stupid and I, I get it,

33
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:06,009
but Gollum was higher on the priority list than tears of the kingdom. That sounds crazy.

34
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:13,339
But do you, do you understand the priorities that I have here? You know what I'm saying? Like Gollum

35
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:20,100
was higher on the priority list, not because Gollum is a better game. Where is the priority

36
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:27,959
for project Zomboid? Uh, okay. It's underneath street fighter six. It's okay. Street fighter

37
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:35,750
six is essentially, okay. I like that. I think I'm going to stream that again. Yeah. It's comedy

38
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:44,740
priorities. Exactly. Where is sorcery on the list? Where's Hilux two on the list? Where's Yakuza zero

39
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:54,709
on the list? Bucko. Ooh, that was a bucko on that one. Yeah. What's that? We can keep talking. Let's

40
00:05:54,709 --> 00:06:05,769
get going. He's pandering. No, I'm pandering. Don't you think pandering would be a month of

41
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:11,930
tears of the kingdom only for you guys. And I'm going to dress his link every day. And I'm also

42
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:24,250
going to go, yeah, skip, skip. Okay. That just sounded like I didn't go all in on it. You can't

43
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:31,379
do that voice unless you go all in and I didn't fucking go all in. That was, that's, I fucking was

44
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:39,060
telling myself go all in or it's going to be embarrassing. And I didn't, you have to go all

45
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:44,019
in because then nobody can make fun of you. Cause it's like, Whoa, you went all in for that. Nice

46
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:52,019
actual effort there. Going scuts, scascute is not what he does. And it's not enough effort.

47
00:06:52,579 --> 00:07:00,889
I need to do more. I try harder. But what if your voice cracks during that? Well, that's a risk you

48
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:13,100
have to take anyways. Welcome back. I'm going to play this fun game. See how it goes. But yeah,

49
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:18,540
I pandering would be if I were to be, Hey, I'm going to stream tears of the kingdom until I beat

50
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:25,100
it. And Hey guys, how about an encore? And I play the whole game again for like another month.

51
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:41,509
No, I'm not pandering. If anything, I'm probably I'm anti pandering. See who are you calling out

52
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:45,910
here? I'm not calling out anybody. I haven't seen one second of tears of the kingdom footage.

53
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:51,660
Zero. Well, that's not, that's not accurate. I've seen people, I've seen people of like

54
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:59,959
sharing like the weird stuff that they're making on Twitter. I don't, I don't want to get spoiled.

55
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:09,350
I haven't even beat breath of the wild. I haven't seen any footage of tears of the kingdom.

56
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:16,649
Okay. I've seen somebody make like a ball sack, right? Every, you've all seen it. Okay. I'm not

57
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:28,709
going to pretend I haven't seen it. What do you mean? What? Oh, working. What? You haven't seen

58
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:33,000
that? I haven't seen it. I haven't seen it. What do you mean? You guys haven't seen, you haven't

59
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:45,299
seen the ball sack from tears of the kingdom? Hold on. I mean, honey, you're a ball sack image

60
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:55,750
that I've seen. Have I seen a ball sack image on Twitter from tears of the kingdom? She said no.

61
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:08,490
Is there like a book, a ball sack? I need to look at something. Hold on a second.

62
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:24,549
I can't, I don't want, no, I'm not writing this. I'm not going to type this in. Can't you, you can

63
00:09:24,549 --> 00:09:33,529
like make any object in tears of the kingdom, right? Isn't that like, Oh, look, the joke I made. Look,

64
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:51,419
I made like a bunch of crazy stuff. Kind of. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. God damn it. I'm hallucinating.

65
00:09:58,299 --> 00:10:04,940
I swear to God, I didn't have a dream that, that people were making. Oh, look, I can combine any

66
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:11,820
object. And look, I made, I made a penis. Am I making that up? Did I have a dream that this

67
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:26,279
happened? Tell me the truth. I'm not making this up. Unless I had a dream that this happened.

68
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:36,149
You said ball sack. Yeah. You said, yeah, but that's why I meant the same, like kind of the

69
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:57,059
same kind of bullshit. All right. Anyways, Vinny made a flaccid penis on stream. Okay. So that,

70
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:01,059
so I know what I'm talking about. This is exactly what I was talking about. Sorry. I used,

71
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:07,220
I used the term ball sack. I used this. I said ball sack instead of, Oh, you didn't say flaccid

72
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:14,100
penis. Oh, those are not the same category. That was, I was talking about the category of,

73
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:23,259
of things that people are making. Sorry. I wasn't super specific. All right. You guys ready to

74
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:39,879
chill out on a chill stream today? You're weird, man. No, you're weird. You're the weird one. Okay.

75
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,539
Not super, you were super specific. You were just wrong. No, I'm just saying like, Oh,

76
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:51,460
I made a ball sack. I made a penis. I made a flaccid penis. It's there. They're in the same

77
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:59,059
category of comedic, comedic, phallic shaped object stuff that people can make in video games

78
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:03,690
with the right tools. And that can like, well, look what I did. Okay. There we go. I made my

79
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:16,970
statement. You said ball sack exclusively for so long. Yeah. But why do we have to pick out every

80
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:23,850
little, you said this and you said that and you didn't use it. You said that. Let's go.

81
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:35,299
You're digging yourself into a hole. I guys, I told you how I literally shit my pants like three

82
00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:49,940
weeks ago. I did. I'm not, I'm, I'm very unbothered. All right. So how does this work? What do you mean?

83
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:55,539
Huh? Oh, they weren't here. Yeah. Let them go find it in the FOD somewhere. You know what I mean?

84
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:03,139
Okay. Draw something in the space below the cursor by moving the mouse, draw a line. We'll press.

85
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:12,419
Okay. So there we go. There it is. Draw something and have it touch the red ball.

86
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:29,720
That is not a red ball. That is a purple ball. Oh no. Hey everybody. I have the proper tools

87
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,799
to be able to make something really interesting here. Don't I?

88
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:49,820
I, it's eyes and here are the eyebrows. Oh shit. How do I clear this? What is it?

89
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:57,500
How do I kind of clear this? I have to change this right now. I have to change this right now

90
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:09,769
before I get in trouble. All right. Touch the left wall with the ball. Oh, oops. That. Okay.

91
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:17,940
You're a Reddit gamer. What does that even mean? Like I just, what do you mean by that?

92
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:23,940
Just like this is a game where you draw lines and push a ball to the other side of the,

93
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:31,269
what do you, why does it have to be a Reddit game? Okay. That's the left wall with your drawing.

94
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:36,870
Draw a stick and let it drop. Draw a slope and let something roll on it. The choice is yours.

95
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:53,269
Touch the left wall with your drawing. Oh, okay. Cool. New questions appeared. What is going on

96
00:14:53,269 --> 00:15:06,100
here? There's a lot. Everyone. Hell. If you solve seven out of 10 questions, the next 10 questions

97
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:13,509
will appear. Oh, okay. I get it. Let's keep going. Touch the left wall with your drawing. Oh,

98
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:21,460
wait. I already did it. I got it. All right. So it's the next one here. Take the ball out.

99
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:27,450
All right. We're going to make a, how do I take the ball out? All right. We're going to go like

100
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:37,340
this and we're going to put, we're going to weigh it down, right? I mean, that was all right. I said

101
00:15:37,340 --> 00:16:03,659
to do a little bit more. Get the ball out. I'm just going to fucking launch it with this like

102
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:45,259
5,000 pound brick. What's fucking happening? This is not, it's not a mobile game ad. Quiet.

103
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:57,620
It's not a mobile game ad. You're wrong. Cause you haven't heard this yet. So you're wrong.

104
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:41,640
Take the ball out. Why can I not do this? I'm going to be honest. Did you take shrooms today?

105
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:59,480
We use more, you need more velocity? Is there actual velocity? Dude, I didn't know there was

106
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,859
actual velocity. I thought it was like based on, all right. Well, I was doing the right thing.

107
00:18:06,869 --> 00:18:14,759
Make the ball touch the left wall. All right. Let's go. Watch this shit. Ready? All right.

108
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:20,490
We wanted to push it this way. So we're going to go like this. I'm just going to build this up

109
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:52,059
until we can get it to push stacks. Can I like prop stuff up? Hold on. What if I do this? Okay.

110
00:18:52,059 --> 00:19:29,140
Ready? No, go this way. How would that have possibly gone that going that way? Is this a bit?

111
00:19:29,140 --> 00:20:03,049
No, it's a physics based puzzle game. Now push that. Can I add weight? Okay. I'm starting to

112
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:19,900
understand that you can actually do long pieces. I'm trying to, I'm trying to make like a hook.

113
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:40,789
Why is it so heavy? But wait on the end of it. It has to hit the left wall. Oh, that was it.

114
00:20:40,789 --> 00:21:04,630
Almost. Your IQ is going down so fast. You don't even, do you have no idea how IQ even works?

115
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:11,640
You don't even know how it works. Do it at the bottom. That was like making like,

116
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:27,670
make it like a, like a crowbar, like bend it. I don't think I can do that. This is a left brain

117
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:40,819
game. That's fine. I mean, I'll, I'll, I'll figure it out. I got it. Got it. Okay. There it goes.

118
00:21:43,670 --> 00:22:05,109
All right. Now what do I do? Now we crushed this. Um, this is too long. What the fuck? I want to

119
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:15,140
put, can I like push it from this way instead? Not really. Chat, you're losing it. Chat's losing

120
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:21,000
it right now. Yeah. Let me tell you something about chat. They can sit there and eat their popcorn

121
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,640
and scream about how I'm not doing this right. But when they get to level seven on their own time,

122
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:31,019
they're going to go, thank fucking God. Nobody's watching me do this. Wait, is he still on chat?

123
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:41,190
Is he still on six? Fucking idiot. You're a fucking stupid idiot. All right. I'm thinking

124
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:52,740
just a bunch of weight here and then connect it like this shit. Or like, can I just like go

125
00:22:52,740 --> 00:23:10,329
like this and just punch it, but wait on the other end. So there is weight. All right. I'm

126
00:23:10,329 --> 00:23:15,289
starting. All right. All right. I know that there's real weight. I know. All right. I didn't,

127
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:34,809
I didn't really know that. Now check this out. Will this stick to walls? Oh, all right. I have

128
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:43,319
to have, this has to touch the left wall. Is it possible that I can make noise? So I can't attach

129
00:23:43,319 --> 00:24:07,990
things, right? Okay. I can catch them like that. Not really though. How do I get this to, all right.

130
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:32,250
It's got to be, catch it all like that. But then how do I, your A, let me tell you something. If

131
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:39,980
you write the same thing a thousand times, it's not going to help me. It's like you guys, you guys

132
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:45,740
are at like the zoo right now. Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid. Hey, can you hear me boy? Hey,

133
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:51,349
can you hear me behind the glass? You're stupid. I just wait to one of the, wait to one of the zoo

134
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:58,230
fucking workers comes out there and throws you out. Don't tap on the glass. I'm busy.

135
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:14,500
Okay. I need to work backwards. So if I were to go like this, I'm just,

136
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:21,849
I'm just curious what happens here. And there it is. Now I just have to very carefully try to make,

137
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:48,150
Oh, fuck you. Not you. Shit. I almost did it. Wait. Shit. Damn it.

138
00:25:50,069 --> 00:26:16,779
But how do I get the ball to move? I feel like it's, I can just have a ball hit it like this,

139
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:33,190
but it bounces too fucking high. Chill stream. Relax. All right. That should be fine. That'll

140
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:50,599
do it right there. Yes. Now everybody sit down. Finally. Hey, finally. Hey, excuse me. Zoo

141
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:57,180
attendant. Yes. Hey, am I allowed to throw stuff? No, no, you've, you've never been allowed to do

142
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:05,460
that. Oh, too bad. Too bad. I could scream at him though, right? Well, technically no. Oh, okay.

143
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,660
Can you get a picture of me in front of, uh, giving the peace sign and like the middle finger.

144
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:26,890
Can I get a picture of that? Two years supporting this clown. Well, that's accurate. Thanks though.

145
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:36,009
You need to be studied because I didn't figure out a physics based open-ended puzzle

146
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:44,539
level in the time that you have allocated for me to do so. This guy had trouble with a physics

147
00:27:44,539 --> 00:28:03,880
based puzzle. Study his brain. Okay. All right. Watch this one. What? Oh, I can't draw in the blue.

148
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:20,140
Okay. So I can, can I just go like this? Draw something and touch the red area. Can I build

149
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:33,210
just like, like a staple tower? I think that makes sense. And then just kind of from here, I guess

150
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:47,099
make like a little bridge and then study him. Study his brain. Study his brain. Oh no.

151
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:56,779
Put five balls in the plate below can be done heavily if drawn persistently at the same point.

152
00:28:56,779 --> 00:29:16,089
Put five balls in the plate. Uh, how do I get them out of here? All right. Can I just drop like a

153
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:23,109
huge, like, can I just like a big like grenade? I think I can do a big grenade. Okay. That's what

154
00:29:23,109 --> 00:29:32,359
I'm going for here. Yep. All right. I'm thinking big, big grenade. And then once I get them up here,

155
00:29:33,319 --> 00:30:16,940
they're going to go like this. I need them to go like this. Fuck. Um, okay. How do I undo? Okay.

156
00:30:16,940 --> 00:31:07,059
How do I get them to get out of here? I win. What? I don't know. You didn't say what balls need to go

157
00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:21,369
in there. I win. That should work. I have balls in the plate, but how do I get them to get out of

158
00:31:21,369 --> 00:31:51,750
here? I need to scoop them. Can I like drag them out? Let me scoop one. Can be done heavily

159
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:58,920
if drawn persistently at the same point. I don't even know what that's telling me to do.

160
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:28,359
You need a big scoop. Hold for more weight. Actually real. Wait, are you serious? Hold on.

161
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:43,400
Are you actually kidding? Hold the mouse down in the same spot. That doesn't work. Hold. I,

162
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:52,359
what do you think I'm doing? I'm holding it right now. You liars. Please read heavily. I don't know

163
00:32:52,359 --> 00:33:10,779
what that can be done heavily if drawn persistently at the same point. What are they talking about?

164
00:33:10,779 --> 00:33:19,589
Bigger ball is more weight. Yeah. I figured that out. It didn't really do anything though.

165
00:33:19,589 --> 00:33:30,819
I tried this already. Wait, if I miss me filling it in like this actually doing stuff,

166
00:33:30,819 --> 00:33:43,609
like spending more time like this. Well, okay. That's good to know. I thought it was just make

167
00:33:43,609 --> 00:33:49,589
a ball and it would be heavier, but apparently I have to like go like this inside of it too.

168
00:33:50,150 --> 00:34:06,619
It's literally not how it works. All right. That has to do it right.

169
00:34:37,820 --> 00:35:01,539
Make a triangle. Make it point this way. Hey, that kind of looks like Nevada. That's where I live.

170
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:25,449
Dude, you can't fit it in there. Make it smaller. You can't. I can't make it smaller. This is as

171
00:35:25,449 --> 00:35:48,139
big as I can make it. I can't fit anything down here. Do it from the ceiling. I can't put it

172
00:35:48,139 --> 00:36:58,340
higher than this. Get in there. Yes. All right. I got one. No, I don't. Okay. I'm thinking have a

173
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:03,420
big flat top like this. So there's a ton of weight because I can't go higher than this

174
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:17,909
and it'll just smash right through. It'd be like a nail driving in. I mean that didn't really work,

175
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:43,579
but I might be okay. It was too close. All right. So that I need more velocity. I this is,

176
00:37:43,579 --> 00:38:02,380
I can't go higher than this. Make a true wedge. I'm going back here and I'm going to make it a

177
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:17,909
big ball with a point right here. I can't make it heavier than this, but there's no way for me to

178
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:24,070
make this heavier. I just have to get lucky and get it to actually hit balls out like that.

179
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:30,579
And there it was. I apparently, apparently this was the right object. This like

180
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:34,900
fucked up piece of shit that I made. It was the right one. So I was going to remember that.

181
00:38:34,900 --> 00:39:36,940
There it is. One, two, three. I can get these. God damn it. One, two, one, two, three. We're good

182
00:39:36,940 --> 00:40:08,570
right here. I wish that just, it wasn't this high because you can't get any real weight or leverage

183
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:39,019
from this. Don't even say skill issue. I'll tell you about personally. One, two, three.

184
00:40:39,019 --> 00:41:03,219
Fuck you. Come on. Right here. All right. I need literally one more. There it is. Get out of here.

185
00:41:03,219 --> 00:41:38,280
Arrow dynamic Andy. Arrow dynamic Andy. Take the ball out. You got it. That was embarrassing. Well,

186
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:45,860
here's the thing. It wasn't embarrassing for me. So you are putting, you are putting on embarrassment

187
00:41:45,860 --> 00:42:16,550
on me that I do not have. I'm fine. I feel great. I feel good. Why did I think that was going to

188
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:59,610
happen? Pull it down. Come on. Check this out. All backwards. Oh, why is it falling forwards?

189
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:17,000
All backwards. This guy does not get physics. Neither do you. Neither do you. What do you know?

190
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,639
You don't know. What do you know? What do you know about physics? Huh? Did you write a paper on it?

191
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:44,650
What do you know? Hey, what do you know about aerodynamics? I have an idea. All right. Wait

192
00:43:44,650 --> 00:44:25,530
a minute. Hold on. Somebody just said they laughed out loud. Stop question marking me.

193
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:42,219
I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't do anything wrong. Pull it back. Pull it back. What are you

194
00:44:42,219 --> 00:44:48,280
doing? That's not, that's not how you fly a plane. Are you out of your mind? What are you doing?

195
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:56,420
There it is. I got it. I actually got it. That's definitely, that's it right there.

196
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:05,349
I win. Oh, question marks, question marks. Over that. This is not a chance in hell that I didn't

197
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:10,900
just take that from mod chat. No way. Not actually physically possible that I, that I

198
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:19,210
took that directly from a mod who drew that exact thing to do. Um, make the ball touch the left

199
00:45:19,210 --> 00:46:01,179
wall. You got it. I want to see, I want to be able to freak out. I want to make it so it can't go

200
00:46:01,179 --> 00:46:10,199
down. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Like this. I want to, why can I draw where I want to draw?

201
00:46:11,659 --> 00:46:26,039
All right. So now it can't go this way. So it has to just go, looks in the right spot.

202
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:34,519
Like I'm playing a claw machine. There it is. You question marking. I just beat it.

203
00:46:45,190 --> 00:47:12,300
I don't know. I have no idea. I almost need to see this burst. I need to, because it needs to be

204
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:19,800
heavy here to fall this way hard to launch this up. But how do I get that to actually do like,

205
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:29,139
do I have to do, I need to draw it. I wish there was a, like a paint mode. Because if I go like

206
00:47:30,570 --> 00:48:02,139
this, will it like, no, I need to like a thing to just launch it up. Oh,

207
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:51,559
Oh, what do you know about that? Huh? Oh shit. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don't,

208
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:57,130
I don't know how this works. I don't have a physics degree. Okay. I don't,

209
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:02,949
do you understand like where leverage points are to pick up a toy on the ground?

210
00:49:02,949 --> 00:49:23,500
It needs to be further out like here. What are you, I didn't want to hit space idiot.

211
00:49:39,719 --> 00:49:43,500
This end on the right side, this side has to be longer than this side. How the fuck am I going

212
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:59,619
to do that? Hold on. No, I need to, it's so funny going over and looking at the chat here.

213
00:49:59,619 --> 00:50:05,099
It's just people screaming their interpretation of what they think I should do. You tap them on the

214
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:16,539
glass right now. Like how am I supposed to read any of this? How did I graduate? I didn't go to

215
00:50:16,539 --> 00:50:30,710
college for physics. I didn't go to school for physics. Huh? Bro, I can't believe you graduated

216
00:50:30,710 --> 00:51:10,980
from your physics math college. I didn't. That's it right there. Come on, grab them. No, I'm just

217
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:22,389
too much. You got, that can't be, it's got to be like a bow in the middle right there. Bang.

218
00:51:22,389 --> 00:52:24,630
Don't forget about the counterweight. I almost had it. Okay. Shh. Where am I sir? Shit. I can't

219
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:58,739
make him stand up. All right. That's going to be bigger. No, I didn't want to hold stuff a little

220
00:52:58,739 --> 00:53:25,429
too long. Yeah. Oh, that's going to be way easier. Why did I not, why would I do not, this is going

221
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:52,650
to work in only like a couple of tries. Why did I overcomplicate this? This is so much easier.

222
00:53:52,650 --> 00:54:20,230
Oh my God. I just heard it. Okay. I heard that from across the whole fucking, I heard that from

223
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:49,219
far away. I was really far away. There it is. Don't fall forward. Have, no. Stop this shit at once.

224
00:54:55,260 --> 00:55:00,039
Ooh, wait. No, no, no. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

225
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:32,409
Just stay right there. We're fine. Draw something and touch the red area. You got it. Yeah. Don't

226
00:55:32,409 --> 00:55:40,860
worry. I know how to get up there. I've played Tetris before and lost every time. I have an idea.

227
00:55:40,860 --> 00:56:03,909
I have an idea. Watch this. Take this out. Oh, you guys are going to fucking freak out when you see

228
00:56:03,909 --> 00:56:50,309
this. That's the right idea. The ball was just too big. See you. Make the ball touch the ground.

229
00:56:50,309 --> 00:56:54,219
All right. This is going to, this is going to take us a little while. I think you ever heard of a

230
00:56:54,219 --> 00:57:00,820
square. I want that person permanently banned and then I want you to unban them. And I want,

231
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:06,440
I want them to give a paragraph as to why they think this should be allowed back.

232
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:29,429
Okay. All right. Let's just like fuck the whole thing up. How does this sound? Oh man. Okay. Is

233
00:57:29,429 --> 00:57:47,619
this like stupid? No, almost not really. Hold on. Almost not really. Wait a second. Wait a second.

234
00:57:48,360 --> 00:58:14,219
Wait a second. There it is. I just got to weigh this down. There it is. Oh, what happened? Okay.

235
00:58:14,219 --> 00:58:25,960
Cool. Oh, wait a minute. Okay. We're at, where are we? Primary one. Okay. Yeah. I'm not ready

236
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:31,719
for that. Make the ball touch the weight. I already did this. Didn't I already do this one?

237
00:58:31,719 --> 00:58:52,199
How's this one different? Make the ball touch the left wall. I did it already. Yes, I did. Oh,

238
00:58:52,199 --> 00:59:27,260
it's just to get it out before. Oh shit. That's okay. That is different. I just, just wait

239
00:59:27,260 --> 01:00:07,500
before you do your question marks. Just wait a second. I'm fucking up and oh, it's really heavy.

240
01:00:07,500 --> 01:01:38,260
Come on. That's gotta be it. Yay. Oh, not yet. Wait, you're doing the same thing over and over

241
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:46,730
again. That's what I'm trying to. Yeah. Well, you have to, I'm deducing what's going on.

242
01:01:46,730 --> 01:02:03,670
Turn the music off. Yeah. Let's get it. Let's get our own soundtrack in here because this is,

243
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:18,179
yeah. How about, give me an OST. Did it again. Guys, that's what you do. Hold on. I'm not quite

244
01:02:18,179 --> 01:02:36,070
ready yet. Can I even save this? How about, what do you guys think? How you guys doing?

245
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:41,030
You could turn off music and then just play, we could play our own. That's a really smart way to

246
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:47,400
do this. Um, people will get mad if it's not coming through my stream. That's a very smart

247
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:56,679
thing to do though. All right. How about, um, pizza tower? Yeah. I love that so much, but

248
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:05,099
animal crossing. Yeah. Animal crossing is pretty damn good. Celeste is really good too. How about,

249
01:03:05,099 --> 01:03:15,289
um, yeah, let's go with animal crossing. Which one though? Super Mario world. Oh,

250
01:03:15,289 --> 01:03:20,500
that's a good one too. I'm doing that first. Super Mario world for the S N S O S T.

251
01:03:21,059 --> 01:03:52,809
And let me turn this off. Uh, what is it? There we go. Uh, here it is. Is it? Yep. Yeah. That sounds

252
01:03:52,809 --> 01:04:58,500
good to me. Shit. This is too big. What are you doing? Damn it. Hold on. I'll get it. You need

253
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:03,219
enough weight to pull it back and then you need the support here to really give it the leverage

254
01:05:03,219 --> 01:06:16,010
that like, but then what the hell? Hold on. I think I actually just did it. No. Now what needs to

255
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:33,210
happen? Fulcrum fulcrum fulcrum. What is a fulcrum fulcrum fulcrum? That's the first time I've ever

256
01:06:33,210 --> 01:06:45,139
heard that word. I don't know what that is. I'm telling you right now. I've never heard that word

257
01:06:45,139 --> 01:06:54,340
said out loud point on which a lever rests or is supported and on which it pivots the pivot point.

258
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:59,980
Pivot point sounds way better than fulcrum. Fulcrum actually sounds pretty cool though.

259
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:04,889
Fulcrum is actually now I'm going to start using that because I actually kind of like that. Nice,

260
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:12,579
dude. All right. All right. So the pivot point, I need a different pivot point. Don't use words

261
01:07:12,579 --> 01:07:24,710
that I don't understand. Oh my goodness. Okay. I'm almost there. I just have to fix this and it's

262
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:37,019
good. Watch this. This is stupid and it's really bad idea, but I'm going to go for it. I've ruined

263
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:44,920
it. I didn't have the fulcrum in the right spot. I still think I can do this though. Watch this.

264
01:07:44,920 --> 01:08:07,610
I didn't want to click again. I got the fulcrum point in the right spot. That was much better.

265
01:08:07,610 --> 01:08:41,640
So it needs to like pivot here, but how you can't change the width of your lines. That's why it's

266
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:50,470
kind of hard to do this. Push it down from the right side. That's actually not a bad idea. It's

267
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:58,840
going to just wedge it in there. Let's actually do something. Hold on. I didn't actually win.

268
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:08,170
So that music doesn't make sense. You're getting mocked by the music. Oh, wait a minute. Hold on.

269
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:22,789
Why do I think it has to be in one piece? Right? I got to put the fulcrum down here.

270
01:09:28,649 --> 01:09:55,180
All right. Now what happens? Got it. Almost. Almost. Fulcrum's got to go right here. Okay.

271
01:09:55,180 --> 01:10:21,529
I didn't want to do that. Now just smash the whole thing with a rock and it'll fix itself.

272
01:10:21,529 --> 01:10:39,420
Pull it. Oh, shit. It's almost there. I can't. I think I got it though. If I knock this down,

273
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:58,039
uh, fulcrum is too high. We're going to do double fulcrum. I think that works.

274
01:10:58,039 --> 01:11:26,310
Double fulcrum into pull, grab. I just freaked out. I almost had it though. Bro, are you, I'm tweaking?

275
01:11:26,310 --> 01:11:42,170
What? Is it going to do anything? I'm just doing this to make it look like I'm, I'm doing better.

276
01:11:42,170 --> 01:12:46,949
Wait, weigh him down. Fuck. Let's do it again. Shit. One or two is fine. Is that in a good spot?

277
01:12:46,949 --> 01:12:59,100
It's hard to tell. No, it keeps hitting it. Stop doing the claw. Well, how do I get it to pull down?

278
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:24,819
The claw works. You just got to make sure it's small. How big should I make the fulcrum? I feel

279
01:13:24,819 --> 01:13:30,340
like the fulcrum needs to be further in. I can't color the fulcrum in. And I did learn a new word

280
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:47,960
today. So I'm going to use it many more times tonight. It's not heavy enough. Make it wider.

281
01:13:47,960 --> 01:14:14,619
This is the one right here. This is it. It's got to be in tighter, like here. Why can I not color

282
01:14:14,619 --> 01:14:28,810
this in? Stop doing the triangles. All right. I got to pull it over this. I got it. That's the one

283
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:47,829
done pretty much. But now I can, can I, I can, I, I, can I, can I fix it? I almost need to make,

284
01:14:47,829 --> 01:14:53,880
okay. Hold on. Let me draw this out. Here's the fulcrum point, which is where it's going to tip.

285
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:59,479
It's going to hit this, pull it tip. So it's going to tip. So let's weigh it down here

286
01:14:59,479 --> 01:15:09,510
and let's make a line. The point of this fulcrum. See what I'm saying? So now when it pulls down,

287
01:15:10,149 --> 01:15:16,170
it can't get all screwed up. So now what's going to happen is I'm going to pull it down. It's going

288
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:54,579
to go over here. Ball's going to fall out. What do I do? What do I do? Okay. I'm going for it.

289
01:15:54,579 --> 01:16:30,220
Yeah. Right when we got to Bowser's castle. All right. Take the ball out. Okay. That's the

290
01:16:30,220 --> 01:17:10,939
right idea. Hit it with a bowling ball. It is a little extra weight Alex in the container. Okay.

291
01:17:10,939 --> 01:17:28,260
Let's go. I'm going to do a mini one. Okay. Now the idea is to hit this, hit them, hit them right

292
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:58,279
in the bottom of the chin, fly them up. He's getting in. Where'd he go? Okay. Well, I guess

293
01:17:58,279 --> 01:18:08,380
he's gone. Is it too high? Is he eventually going to fall down? I don't know. That's definitely the

294
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:24,199
right idea though. It's supposed to be a little bit smaller, not as powerful. Well, it went the

295
01:18:24,199 --> 01:19:10,180
wrong way. Perfect. God damn it. No, no, no. Just wait. I should have gone from up here. I got him.

296
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:57,640
I'm going to pull him in. Hook strat. I fucking ruined it. You better come back down. I'm going

297
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:38,739
to be pissed. No, wrong way. This is it. This is the one right here. Okay. I'm not going to

298
01:20:38,739 --> 01:20:51,779
mess around. Not huge, but big enough to get the weight. There he goes. And thank you. Clutch at

299
01:20:51,779 --> 01:21:02,680
the end there. That was clutch at the end there. I think I can take that one. That's pretty clutch.

300
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:24,199
Make the ball touch the red area. First try. First try. I just made a tank. Suma wrestler,

301
01:21:24,199 --> 01:21:40,659
touch the left wall. Got it. Check this out. You might've thought that was a mistake. If I wasn't

302
01:21:40,659 --> 01:21:46,090
talking, it would have been fine. I was, I was villain monologuing and lost when I had the whole

303
01:21:46,090 --> 01:22:00,949
fucking thing one. All right. Make the ball touch the left wall. All right. This is going to be

304
01:22:00,949 --> 01:22:10,250
interesting. Okay. Let's go with the tank strat with the long stick hanging out. And then we're

305
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:17,420
going to add to that. I'm going to put a little bit more weight down here. Boom. Now we're going

306
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:41,189
to restart. Just like scrape it with just with your weird like finger. The idea is to have the ball

307
01:22:42,069 --> 01:22:49,739
right here. Be the thing that smashes into the side with my physics based technology

308
01:22:49,739 --> 01:23:06,659
with patented physics based ball creation technology. Patented physics based ball

309
01:23:06,659 --> 01:23:59,779
weight technology. Make the shape face right. You got it. You know exactly what I'm doing here.

310
01:23:59,779 --> 01:24:13,779
I don't know anything besides rock smash something. You know it's happening. I know how to do a

311
01:24:13,779 --> 01:24:53,989
see-saws. Oh, we've got a little bit of a counterweight problem. Fulcrum. We take fulcrum

312
01:24:53,989 --> 01:25:14,739
in a big good spot. Bit by poisonous snake. Feel face scaling numb. Oh, good thing we have continuous.

313
01:25:14,739 --> 01:25:26,489
This is the one right there. There's a little saliva in my mouth. You know, it's the real one.

314
01:25:26,489 --> 01:26:28,939
Fucking thing. What are you talking about? It's stuck on the wall. There it is. Oh, how was it?

315
01:26:28,939 --> 01:26:42,710
Why is the face the other way? My family is in my living room watching you play this for an hour

316
01:26:42,710 --> 01:26:46,949
straight and my dad has been getting pissed at you not knowing what a fulcrum is and now he's

317
01:26:46,949 --> 01:26:53,850
yelling at the screen because you're hook strats. Hold on a second, dad. First of all, I appreciate

318
01:26:53,850 --> 01:27:00,300
the constructive feedback on how I'm playing this game. I appreciate the constructive feedback.

319
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:07,479
But, I don't know. I was about to just like start screaming at whoever this is.

320
01:27:10,579 --> 01:27:21,670
But then, I don't know. I feel like whoever the son or daughter is in this case, I feel like they'd

321
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:26,090
be like, oh my God, I got to switch to somebody else like right now. Quick, quick, quick,

322
01:27:26,090 --> 01:27:35,529
switch to somebody else. And who else is streaming right now? I don't care who it is. Okay, I'm going

323
01:27:35,529 --> 01:27:47,510
to be fine. I have an idea. My idea is very simple. See, what we have to do is we make the

324
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:59,689
fulcrum point here, add the seesaw bit right here, and very easy. We get Batman to show up

325
01:27:59,689 --> 01:28:08,979
and we crush him. We kill the Batman. Oh, Joker, you have no idea what you're doing.

326
01:28:09,939 --> 01:28:17,380
You can't complete this puzzle game. We're going to have any characters show up on Jerma's stream.

327
01:28:20,310 --> 01:28:39,449
Shut up. Dad just laughed out loud. I heard it. I could hear it through the television.

328
01:28:39,449 --> 01:28:47,140
I heard dad laugh at the television after that one, and I'm not happy about it.

329
01:29:11,109 --> 01:29:45,899
What was the point of drawing these? I'm just going to do the hook again. What? What am I doing?

330
01:29:45,899 --> 01:29:52,310
I don't know. Stop the hook bullshit. Stop the hook bullshit. I'm doing it the other way.

331
01:29:52,310 --> 01:30:05,369
I had a good idea. I need a way better fulcrum like that. Now see this. Now hear this. See this.

332
01:30:05,369 --> 01:30:15,770
You seeing this? Watch this. This is going to be unbelievable. Dad, hold on to the couch

333
01:30:15,770 --> 01:30:44,380
because here it comes. Hold on to something. Hey, hey, it's very funny. Hey, son or daughter,

334
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:49,000
come and give me a hug. What a great bonding experience this was between us.

335
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:53,819
Exactly what I'm looking for. That's what I'm looking for. What a bonding experience

336
01:30:54,140 --> 01:31:00,140
you had over this. That's great. I'm glad. I hope the strength of your family is stronger now.

337
01:31:00,140 --> 01:31:44,550
What the hell is this? What is this? Still Mario? This is not Mario anymore. Any mods in here that

338
01:31:44,550 --> 01:32:06,840
can give me a hand with this? That's a good idea. I think it's a combination of hook strategy

339
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:15,380
and ball strategy. Two of my favorite things in the game. Now that's going to work. That's

340
01:32:15,380 --> 01:32:33,270
a combination of hook and ball strategy. Maybe up a little higher. Make a scooper like that.

341
01:32:33,270 --> 01:32:59,619
Kind of. It needs to be small. Even smaller than that? Really? This will do it. That's it

342
01:32:59,619 --> 01:33:06,649
right there. Oh my god. Make the ball heavier, not bigger. I don't, I don't know what that means

343
01:33:06,649 --> 01:33:14,899
because I don't, I don't get what you mean. Was that actually a thing in the game or were people

344
01:33:14,899 --> 01:33:33,350
making that up? It's real. So if I just sit here and hold the button down like this, this will be

345
01:33:33,350 --> 01:33:42,970
much heavier. Give it a point. That's the one right there. All right. All right. We're halfway

346
01:33:42,970 --> 01:33:50,810
there. I now I'm thinking hook strategy here. I just have to push this over. Here's my idea.

347
01:33:50,810 --> 01:34:05,850
I don't think it's going to work, but I could try. I'm thinking make a long road and just drop a

348
01:34:05,850 --> 01:34:17,050
boulder down here, but I don't think that's going to do it. Put a hook on the hook. Why did I even

349
01:34:17,050 --> 01:34:23,750
listen to that person? Why did I listen to that person? But make, hold on, make like one of these.

350
01:34:23,750 --> 01:35:20,789
Will that like help kind of move it? Come on, stop. Maybe that little dip will be enough. Smash.

351
01:35:20,789 --> 01:35:29,500
All right. This is not horrible, but it kind of is horrible. It's too long. It needs to be way shorter.

352
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:38,680
But this needs to be longer and this needs to be shorter. This needs to be barely right there.

353
01:35:41,130 --> 01:35:47,079
Now we're going to make a first hook. Is this too big? You think this is too big?

354
01:35:47,079 --> 01:36:13,880
That's my favorite item from Costco. Um, uh, I don't know. Cheese. I do like the point though.

355
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:22,069
Make this sort of like a triangle. Have a point that just smushes right onto that line. I want

356
01:36:22,069 --> 01:36:30,470
this thing to flip. It's upright. All right. It's upright, but how do I get it to go all the way?

357
01:36:30,470 --> 01:37:27,529
Cause I can't delete anything. It'd be a fulcrum. I need something to wedge under it as it flips.

358
01:37:27,529 --> 01:38:00,199
Something over here. Maybe if I go like this, will it push this? I don't know. Oh, no.

359
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:21,109
Flip it the other way. Can I flip it? Hold on. Let me cook for a second. Watch this.

360
01:38:21,109 --> 01:39:26,859
Didn't even think about that. Did we? Didn't think about this. Did we? My dad is screaming at me.

361
01:39:26,859 --> 01:40:04,789
Hurry, dude. You're evolving backwards. Please. You don't have to do every level, but I'm,

362
01:40:04,789 --> 01:40:13,079
I want to see, I want to try. He needs a recipe book. VOD watchers skip an hour. You know,

363
01:40:13,079 --> 01:40:18,710
when I'm watching a VOD and I look over a chat and I see some, and I'm just hanging out with my,

364
01:40:18,710 --> 01:40:25,109
you know, sandwich and my, you know, my large turkey sandwich, lettuce, mustard, mayo mix,

365
01:40:25,109 --> 01:40:30,819
tomato, one thin sliced tomato. Just kidding. Take that off. Don't put that on any food.

366
01:40:30,819 --> 01:40:41,350
Lettuce, mayo with some turkey stalling. I don't like looking over and people going,

367
01:40:41,350 --> 01:40:47,770
Hey, skip for an hour. I don't, I don't tell me what to do. You just spoiled that the stream,

368
01:40:47,770 --> 01:40:51,880
the streamer didn't, you know, I don't tell me what to do. You shouldn't be telling the

369
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:58,409
VOD watchers what to do. VOD watchers skip an hour. That's their decision. They just did,

370
01:40:58,409 --> 01:41:45,340
but at least it was their call, not yours. Insecure Andy. I'm just fucking, I need to see how it

371
01:41:45,340 --> 01:42:47,159
bounces. Okay. You need a fulcrum. Make Alex touch the right wall. You got it. Okay. When in doubt,

372
01:42:47,159 --> 01:42:59,979
when in doubt, you just, just use the hook. I don't think I can do anything with the tail,

373
01:42:59,979 --> 01:43:34,260
this stuff on the way. Right wall. Okay. So if I go like this, what music is playing?

374
01:43:34,260 --> 01:45:04,460
A club penguin, I guess. Uh, what else? Use a hammer. Okay. That's an ax. What? No, wrong.

375
01:45:11,689 --> 01:45:34,220
Really? What do you mean? Touch the ground with the red object. A little bit of a claw strategy

376
01:45:34,220 --> 01:46:17,979
will work pretty good. Shit. Pull it off. Just have to touch the ground. All right. Now I need

377
01:46:17,979 --> 01:46:46,520
to knock this over. Touch the ground. Touch the ground. Oh my God. Uh, yes. That's the red area

378
01:46:46,520 --> 01:47:05,319
with your drawing. You can't draw in the blue area. Um, don't need a fulcrum on that one. Make

379
01:47:05,319 --> 01:47:23,720
the ball touch the left wall. What do you think? Oh, let me talk about Gen loss for a little bit.

380
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:30,779
So those who didn't see, uh, generation loss, it was Rambo's show. It's a three day event. It was

381
01:47:30,779 --> 01:47:34,729
really, really cool. I'll just give you a, I know that, um, there's been a lot of behind the scenes

382
01:47:34,729 --> 01:47:44,359
stuff you may have seen, but, uh, I don't know how much anybody was paying attention or knows or

383
01:47:44,359 --> 01:47:51,020
the second day, uh, Rambo and I came up with a lot of that stuff together. So it was really fun.

384
01:47:51,020 --> 01:48:03,500
That was a long time ago too. The hook longer on the left side. Yeah. I'm thinking like this.

385
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:15,369
That's not a hook. Now it is. I was really excited because obviously Rambo had this incredible

386
01:48:15,369 --> 01:48:24,340
passion project and it was kind of just like, Hey, do you want to do this? And then originally

387
01:48:24,340 --> 01:48:33,960
I was potentially going to be in a mask. Uh, Rambo was like, Hey, what if we just put you in

388
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:40,460
a bunch of prosthetics? Cause that mass that I had was going to be, Oh, what are we going to, I guess

389
01:48:40,460 --> 01:48:44,539
try to speed a mass. Should I have like makeup on? Should I, you know, should we make me look,

390
01:48:44,539 --> 01:48:50,199
how do we do it? And it gave me this great excuse to get into all that prosthetics,

391
01:48:50,199 --> 01:49:10,569
touch the left wall. And I do, I have this mold. It is a one-to-one complete replica of my face.

392
01:49:11,130 --> 01:49:24,250
Like I said earlier, down to every pore. It is better than HD. Show it. I'll show it one day.

393
01:49:24,250 --> 01:49:29,079
You need to smash that. You're repeating yourself. I know cause I'm thinking and I can't do,

394
01:49:29,079 --> 01:49:45,979
I can't talk and think at the same time, but it was really cool to be a part of it. I remember,

395
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:54,180
so that, that Wonka kind of like candy room. I remember I was writing it down and I'm just

396
01:49:54,180 --> 01:50:00,100
sitting there going, is this like, is this going to be in the show? Is this going to like make it?

397
01:50:01,369 --> 01:50:12,489
And it did. I was really happy about it. I hung out with a lot of really cool people,

398
01:50:12,489 --> 01:50:16,729
got to meet a lot of new people and a lot of people that I've never communicated with

399
01:50:16,729 --> 01:50:27,529
like ever before. Obviously it was really cool to, to see Vinny. That's the first time me and Vinny

400
01:50:27,529 --> 01:50:38,920
have seen each other since like PAX 2015 or something. So that was really, really awesome.

401
01:50:38,920 --> 01:51:08,279
I'm not doing this right. This is making me irrationally angry. Well, at, at least you're

402
01:51:08,279 --> 01:51:13,850
aware of that. You know what I mean? Like this is making me irrationally angry. It's actually

403
01:51:13,850 --> 01:51:18,810
really important for you to kind of decipher that this is a rational anger. It's a rational what

404
01:51:18,810 --> 01:51:24,380
you're saying, right? You've been being mindful of that. That's really, really important. Time

405
01:51:24,380 --> 01:51:47,590
that person up for an hour. Shit. Can I have some help? Can anybody help me? I know what I have to

406
01:51:47,590 --> 01:51:58,069
do, but I can't visualize it. Yeah. Walking around those sets. That was absolutely the biggest

407
01:51:58,069 --> 01:52:14,979
project I've ever been a part of, ever been on. There were so many individual sets. Now, you know,

408
01:52:14,979 --> 01:52:24,899
honestly hats off to Rambo for having the, you know, having the ability to want to put on something

409
01:52:24,899 --> 01:52:29,989
like that and to be able to be that passionate about something. I'd love to see that stuff

410
01:52:29,989 --> 01:52:39,819
because that's, it's not easy. It really isn't. So honestly hats off to Rambo and everybody else,

411
01:52:39,819 --> 01:52:46,170
obviously that was working on the project too. It was really, really, it was, it was exciting.

412
01:52:46,170 --> 01:52:55,720
It was fun. I got to go in prosthetics and be a fucking weirdo for like six hours. And I think,

413
01:52:55,720 --> 01:53:00,680
I think he wants to do more. I think there's, I think that's, I don't know, he seemed pretty

414
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:11,859
excited to like kind of keep doing more stuff. It's like, hell yeah. That's, I love it. What

415
01:53:11,859 --> 01:53:23,939
about your ass breaking the door? Yeah. I mean, I, my ass didn't break the door. I broke the door

416
01:53:23,939 --> 01:53:31,159
with my body and then I kind of, at the very end, my ass was sort of the jokey part that I could say

417
01:53:31,159 --> 01:53:38,359
broke it. I didn't actually break the door with my ass. It, it was perceived that way because I

418
01:53:38,359 --> 01:53:43,000
mean, obviously that's what exactly what it looked like. And then I'm seeing a lot of copium and

419
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:53,739
CAPAs. I, all right, I stopped making a long hook over and over again and do it right. Were you

420
01:53:53,739 --> 01:54:01,939
actually stuck? Kind of, I kind of, because those doors were made, were not, they were not operational.

421
01:54:01,939 --> 01:54:06,779
It was like, there were people that were opening and closing those two doors. Like they were

422
01:54:06,779 --> 01:54:11,739
opening them and closing them. And I kind of just pushed it, going through it too fast.

423
01:54:11,739 --> 01:54:22,060
This, yeah, they were like Star Trek doors. The reveal of the two foot long revolver.

424
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:42,949
At least we're making music. I'm sorry about this. Draw the weight on the left side. All right,

425
01:54:42,949 --> 01:55:03,609
I can pay attention again. How do I get the ball over there? Terma straight up murders someone. Yeah.

426
01:55:04,329 --> 01:55:15,239
I remember when we were talking about that scene, I was like, okay, so I'm, I, I, I'm gonna shoot her.

427
01:55:18,100 --> 01:55:22,180
Whoever it is. Because the way that that was going to work out was it was always going to have to be

428
01:55:22,180 --> 01:55:29,779
somebody, right? There were only two or three people that could have been in there. So it was

429
01:55:29,779 --> 01:55:34,020
like, okay, who could it even be? Who is the, who are the possible candidates that could be in this

430
01:55:34,020 --> 01:55:39,140
room? Because obviously that was the chat interaction and stuff too. So as we're going through, it's

431
01:55:39,140 --> 01:55:45,899
like, okay, so it could be you. It could be you. It could be, all right. So now how, so I have to

432
01:55:45,899 --> 01:56:11,220
shoot someone. How do I move this? This is a mobile ad. I know it's a mobile ad. I'm skipping this one.

433
01:56:11,220 --> 01:56:15,460
Also, if you wanted something interesting, let me talk about this because this is, and let me turn

434
01:56:15,460 --> 01:56:24,229
this music down because this is weird. So during the first three rooms, so the, the surgery room,

435
01:56:24,229 --> 01:56:30,890
the carousel room and the electric zap key room, I didn't have any direction in my ear.

436
01:56:32,649 --> 01:56:40,729
So if you're wondering why I didn't pick the right person on the carousel is because I had,

437
01:56:40,729 --> 01:56:44,569
I did not know who it was because we didn't, I didn't have it in my ear because I had,

438
01:56:46,060 --> 01:56:53,140
it was a technical problem. So for the first three rooms, I was just like, oh, oh, fuck. I need to,

439
01:56:53,859 --> 01:56:57,779
I need to pay close attention to everything going on because I have no direction in my ear.

440
01:56:57,779 --> 01:57:09,850
So it was, there was an internal moment as we were starting that third kind of carousel scene

441
01:57:09,850 --> 01:57:17,100
where I was just going, all right, man, this is a good luck because I don't know what's really

442
01:57:17,100 --> 01:57:23,659
going on. I kind of just went in there and it was like, all right, I'm just going to have fun.

443
01:57:23,659 --> 01:57:29,590
And that's exactly what it was. It was such a fun time to just put on that, those prosthetics.

444
01:57:33,739 --> 01:57:41,210
I loved that. I loved every second of doing that. I think I even said to Rambo, I was like, oh man,

445
01:57:41,210 --> 01:57:45,130
imagine, imagine we had like three more rooms to do. I feel like we were just, you know,

446
01:57:45,689 --> 01:57:53,609
we were just getting right into it. Yeah, there's a point where Slimesicle, because I think Slimesicle

447
01:57:53,609 --> 01:57:59,720
had direction in his ear. And there's a point where he's just like, hey, uh, don't, I mean,

448
01:57:59,720 --> 01:58:04,520
if I was somebody picking, I think I would probably, you know, I may have, you know, maybe pick,

449
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:10,260
uh, pick her. And I was like, oh, what do you, yeah, that's really you. Is that what you,

450
01:58:10,340 --> 01:58:23,930
is that what you think? Okay. All right. You. Oh yeah. I, Slimesicle saved my ass so bad.

451
01:58:23,930 --> 01:58:28,729
I had absolutely no idea who, who got the audience poll. So I'm just sitting there going,

452
01:58:28,729 --> 01:58:35,960
oh, okay. If you go back and watch it, I just, I just start stalling. I start stalling for time

453
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:41,739
because I just start doing duck, duck, goose. That is, that is the moment in the show when

454
01:58:41,739 --> 01:58:47,340
you can know somebody got picked and I have no fucking idea who it is. I have not a single

455
01:58:47,340 --> 01:58:55,560
solitary clue. So duck, uh, duck, I don't fucking know how I'm going to get through this one.

456
01:58:55,560 --> 01:59:00,279
I don't know. I guess I was going to be like a weirdo with this prosthetics on and let me

457
01:59:00,279 --> 01:59:16,520
walk around in a circle. Okay. I got this one. I know how to do it. We can put these back.

458
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:24,170
And that was, uh, uh, Valkyrae and Psychuno were the rats. They were a lot of fun to work with.

459
01:59:24,170 --> 01:59:43,529
Valkyrae was super into that. It was awesome. Yeah. Super, super nice. They were really,

460
01:59:43,529 --> 01:59:48,010
really cool. Just kind of hanging out and talking about random stuff. All right. How

461
01:59:48,010 --> 01:59:57,939
do the, how are the rats going to act? Let's see. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it.

462
01:59:57,939 --> 02:00:14,329
That's it right there. Now, come on, come on, come on, come on. This is a hook scenario, right?

463
02:00:27,909 --> 02:00:34,729
What are your children's names? Yeah. Just, just walking up to Austin, just like, you know,

464
02:00:34,729 --> 02:00:40,539
fluffing up his shirt a little, come here, you, let me, come here. What are your children's names?

465
02:00:40,539 --> 02:00:51,880
It's just like, oh, fuck. Uh-oh. He is so goddamn fucking funny, by the way. I love

466
02:00:51,880 --> 02:01:03,609
working with Austin. He is so fucking funny. Maybe I could just grab this one too. Let me,

467
02:01:03,609 --> 02:01:10,890
let me try the grab. You know what I'm saying? The grab worked pretty well on the other one.

468
02:01:10,890 --> 02:01:27,479
Why wouldn't it work well on this one? All right. We're getting somewhere. What about your runway

469
02:01:27,479 --> 02:01:39,989
walk? Yeah. I've seen that pop up here and there. I love that cartoon villain shit, you know, going

470
02:01:39,989 --> 02:01:43,750
into the, to the, the candy room, like that Willy Wonka inspired room being like, oh, hey,

471
02:01:43,750 --> 02:01:47,670
can you hold this for a sec? Oh, the detonator and, and, you know, the, all the things that

472
02:01:47,670 --> 02:01:54,859
you could get out with. I love the loony tunes bullshit. It's just, it just does it for me so

473
02:01:54,859 --> 02:02:27,909
much. Is this going to do it? It needs to be really, really heavy shit with the walls flavored. I

474
02:02:27,909 --> 02:02:36,659
don't, I don't think so. The goal with that room was to show people like, well, you do other shit

475
02:02:36,659 --> 02:02:45,850
here. What do you, why? What? There was a bit that didn't get used that I really wanted to do,

476
02:02:45,850 --> 02:02:51,020
but I guess there was just not enough time or not enough space or whatever. So here's what I

477
02:02:51,020 --> 02:02:55,340
wanted to have happen. And it was, it was close to happening, but it just kind of didn't work.

478
02:02:55,340 --> 02:03:02,100
When we were initially doing concept stuff, I thought it would have been funny if the,

479
02:03:02,100 --> 02:03:05,300
so one of the rooms seems like a bit of room to room to room. Okay. We're in this room. Okay.

480
02:03:05,300 --> 02:03:09,539
I made it out of this one. I'm on the next room. So take the party through the new room and they

481
02:03:09,539 --> 02:03:15,220
open the door. Okay. What's the next one? What's the next weird saw inspired crazy puzzler weird

482
02:03:15,220 --> 02:03:21,289
room. Right. And it's just a living room. It's just a regular living room with nothing weird.

483
02:03:21,289 --> 02:03:25,689
And I just say, well, um, you know, I run an Airbnb out of here sometimes too. And actually

484
02:03:25,689 --> 02:03:28,890
they're going to be here in about 20 minutes. So just, this is, there's nothing in here actually.

485
02:03:28,890 --> 02:03:37,640
Just go to the next one and they just walk through it. And it's, it's a nice normal room,

486
02:03:37,640 --> 02:03:52,300
but all that to just do one, like 15 to 22nd routine. Yeah, I get it. I think we need a folk

487
02:03:52,300 --> 02:04:03,289
room or the other thing was, uh, it kind of started growing from there was what if there was just a

488
02:04:03,289 --> 02:04:09,430
family in the room, like on vacation and show people like getting towels and like,

489
02:04:09,430 --> 02:04:17,449
oh, we're going to the beach really soon here. Oh, we're right. We're like, as if we're getting

490
02:04:17,449 --> 02:04:37,720
ready to like at the hotel, what is the cheesecake shit about? You want to know what the cheesecake

491
02:04:37,720 --> 02:04:42,420
shit is about? What do you want me to tell you? Has Rambo talked about the cheesecake shit?

492
02:04:42,420 --> 02:04:49,029
Has anybody talked about the cheesecake thing? Cause it was, it was literally not for anybody,

493
02:04:49,029 --> 02:05:00,329
but for five people that were at dinner the night before. Okay. So they did. They have people have.

494
02:05:00,329 --> 02:05:03,770
Okay. So let me, for those that have not heard the story, and I'm just going to do it really

495
02:05:03,770 --> 02:05:08,010
quickly. Cause you may have heard it like three or four times already. So, and I'm not going to

496
02:05:08,010 --> 02:05:13,739
play the game. So don't just relax. So at dinner, uh, there was a big dinner where there was, you

497
02:05:13,739 --> 02:05:19,939
know, cast and crew. And we all kind of just went to dinner at this nice restaurant, right?

498
02:05:19,939 --> 02:05:26,390
And one of the desserts was cheesecake. So one of the producers and they, we had a lot of people at

499
02:05:26,390 --> 02:05:35,590
this table. So there had to have been at least, at least 15 plus people at this dinner. So at the

500
02:05:35,590 --> 02:05:39,670
end, we got this big package where, okay, we have to feed all these people. We're doing a big group

501
02:05:39,670 --> 02:05:44,739
thing. We got a bunch of desserts and it was probably like, Hey, I mean, it's 15, 20 people

502
02:05:44,739 --> 02:05:48,979
sharing desserts. You have a bunch of different desserts. You've got like, I think we had like

503
02:05:48,979 --> 02:05:55,989
eight to 10 cheesecake slices. They were just cheesecake everywhere. And one of the producers

504
02:05:55,989 --> 02:06:00,869
kind of just looks over, we took a few bites. Oh, this is so good. Wow. It's so delicious.

505
02:06:00,869 --> 02:06:07,260
And he kind of just looks over and he goes, wow, it's a bad day to be a cheesecake. And we were all

506
02:06:07,260 --> 02:06:13,859
like, what the fuck was that? He's like, man, it's a bad day to be a cheesecake, isn't it?

507
02:06:13,859 --> 02:06:23,500
And the whole kind of table is just like, it was like funny, but at the same time it was like,

508
02:06:23,500 --> 02:06:27,180
all right, yeah, that's like, yeah. Cause it is kind of a bad day to be a cheesecake. Like

509
02:06:27,260 --> 02:06:35,689
we're eating a fucking lot of them right now. And Nikki, who was sitting on the other side

510
02:06:35,689 --> 02:06:44,819
of the table, she was laughing her ass off at this, just laughing her ass off. And we kept

511
02:06:44,819 --> 02:06:51,140
saying it and kept kind of going over it. And at the table, we were kind of sitting around going,

512
02:06:51,140 --> 02:06:58,310
all right, we know we're going to be on camera tomorrow. I'm going to do everything I can to

513
02:06:58,310 --> 02:07:03,109
try to make as many people break on camera as possible. I'm going to say that tomorrow.

514
02:07:03,510 --> 02:07:09,579
I'm going to find a way to say this. And people like, dude, please don't do that. You're going to

515
02:07:09,579 --> 02:07:12,789
fuck up the whole show. You're going to ruin the whole show. Cause everyone's going to start

516
02:07:12,789 --> 02:07:19,739
laughing. And it's that it's don't do that. Like should you do that? So I just like waiting for

517
02:07:19,739 --> 02:07:26,220
the opportunity to be like, Oh, so you know that in joke that everybody's like, don't be careful.

518
02:07:26,779 --> 02:07:30,859
Oh, I had pasta today. And that's how I told him I knew it was coming. The people knew it was

519
02:07:30,859 --> 02:07:35,020
coming. The five or six, like seven people at that table knew it was coming when I started

520
02:07:35,020 --> 02:07:43,720
talking about what I ate. So I'm like, Oh yeah. I felt pretty bloated after that. But for dessert.

521
02:07:43,720 --> 02:07:53,800
Oh, let me just tell you it's a bad day to be a cheesecake. All right. Yeah. And that's the

522
02:07:53,800 --> 02:08:07,180
fucking story. The goal was to try to make somebody just desperately fight with trying not to laugh

523
02:08:07,180 --> 02:08:17,159
and fuck up that scene. It was, it was just like a good time. And you know, okay, you know,

524
02:08:17,159 --> 02:08:22,840
whenever you do an event or a show or something, this is what, how I really believe and how I

525
02:08:22,840 --> 02:08:27,659
really feel. No, like jokes are fucking around or anything right now. If people are having a good

526
02:08:27,659 --> 02:08:34,760
time, then I feel like everything is better. The whole show from cast and crew. Everyone's like

527
02:08:34,760 --> 02:08:38,840
actually having a great time. People like laughing. People are really into it. People have just,

528
02:08:38,840 --> 02:08:42,760
you know, this is a fun time that we're all enjoying together. That's the most important

529
02:08:42,760 --> 02:08:51,500
thing. And you look directly at Nikki as well. Yeah. I was going, I was like, okay, I, I know

530
02:08:51,500 --> 02:09:00,220
you're, you're probably going to laugh. You're probably going to break. Um, I don't know. I

531
02:09:00,220 --> 02:09:23,579
don't think I can do this one. What's this one? Make the robot sit on the chair. Wait, what? Can

532
02:09:23,579 --> 02:10:06,069
it be my chair? How do I move this fast enough for, hold on. Should I push his legs? That's not going

533
02:10:06,069 --> 02:10:28,920
to work. How do I make something happen here? I need a fulcrum. Big triangle. You mean for him

534
02:10:28,920 --> 02:10:36,899
to sit on and get like launched? I'm not going to care about this right now. I'm just going to try

535
02:10:36,899 --> 02:10:50,149
to figure out how to move this well. Okay. I don't have much time. I wish I could, there we go. It's

536
02:10:50,149 --> 02:11:12,500
got to be much faster than that. How am I going to make that faster? Okay. Hold on. Wait, wait,

537
02:11:12,500 --> 02:11:51,079
wait. This is hard. Can I just like box him in for a second? Okay. Upside down triangle behind

538
02:11:51,079 --> 02:12:05,899
the chair and then push it forward. Yeah. But I'm upside down, but I feel I wanted to try it the

539
02:12:05,899 --> 02:12:46,260
right way. How do you do this fast enough before he sits down? That's close. Go. It's not heavy

540
02:12:46,260 --> 02:13:23,939
enough. It's not heavy enough. This is very, very hard. Wider, wider. I can't go much wider.

541
02:13:23,939 --> 02:13:34,859
Otherwise it'll just hit the top and not do anything. It's close. Can I like weigh it down?

542
02:13:34,859 --> 02:14:17,770
I think this is still possible from here. Block the guy's ass. I thought I tried last time,

543
02:14:17,770 --> 02:14:44,060
but he's kind of just, hmm. He weighs too much. That doesn't help. You need to move the chair to

544
02:14:44,060 --> 02:14:55,100
the guy. No, I don't. What are you talking about? There's nothing. I can't make anything weigh fast.

545
02:14:55,100 --> 02:14:59,460
I can't, nothing can weigh enough before he's sitting down. See what I mean? Like I could make

546
02:14:59,460 --> 02:15:23,510
it heavier, but you have to do it instantly. Like, can I like just box him in for now? I can't

547
02:15:23,510 --> 02:15:54,069
unless it's, I didn't, what the hell did that do? I wonder if I can, no, you can't just slide back.

548
02:15:54,069 --> 02:16:10,260
I don't get it. Like the sumo wrestler touched the ground? You had it? It's a pain in the ass. I

549
02:16:10,260 --> 02:16:13,939
don't want to do it. I don't like being, I don't like time limits like that. Let me just do it.

550
02:16:13,939 --> 02:16:17,850
I don't want a time limit. I don't want a one second time limit. I mean, I want to be able

551
02:16:17,850 --> 02:16:37,350
to do it at my own pace. I don't want a one and a half second time limit. Oh, this is going to be

552
02:16:37,350 --> 02:16:45,059
fucking hell. Okay. So I kind of need to just go like this, but it needs to weigh. Well, actually

553
02:16:45,059 --> 02:16:54,790
this won't be that bad. Just make it really heavy. You got to touch the ground though. So that

554
02:16:54,790 --> 02:18:48,459
actually might, close. Oh, nice turd. It's not heavy enough. Touch the ground. This weighs a

555
02:18:48,459 --> 02:19:19,370
million pounds. You're saying make a big M or big W? What do you mean? Like how would a W work?

556
02:19:19,370 --> 02:19:26,500
Weigh it down, then draw more above it. Let's go with, or are we going to go with the claw technique?

557
02:19:26,500 --> 02:20:04,139
Hook technique is good. Keeps steady. This thing just needs to weigh a shitload. We're just going

558
02:20:04,139 --> 02:20:28,569
to squish. Do you know what I mean? Just weigh this whole thing down. If this doesn't work, I,

559
02:20:28,569 --> 02:20:53,190
I don't know what I have to do to get it to be perfect. All right, you ready? Let's let it go.

560
02:20:53,190 --> 02:21:18,309
I didn't know this was part of the universe. The hand is part of the universe. Right. Make sure it

561
02:21:18,309 --> 02:21:30,059
doesn't grab because it'll hook on. I like, they like this music. What is it? Is it still Club Penguin?

562
02:21:30,059 --> 02:21:51,909
I like it. I should put on, I want to put on Smash Brothers music. You know, the one that goes,

563
02:21:55,110 --> 02:22:10,139
it's actually getting stuck on the, this is actually the way to do it too. I just keep having to get

564
02:22:10,139 --> 02:22:39,479
caught on stuff. I'm an idiot. Like an idiot. Don't go too close to the edge because it'll get stuck.

565
02:22:39,479 --> 02:23:15,110
How do I, nothing is heavy enough. Nothing's heavy enough. It needs velocity. Put it up higher. I,

566
02:23:15,110 --> 02:23:28,459
I can't. There's a hand in the way. I cannot do anything here. So the highest I can drop this from

567
02:23:28,459 --> 02:24:42,709
is right here. Go from the ground up. How does that work? That's kind of close. Get it. I mean,

568
02:24:42,709 --> 02:24:54,819
I could, I could sit here and grab this all day, but that's just not going to happen. That's what

569
02:24:54,819 --> 02:25:13,450
I wanted to do in the beginning. All right. All right. Hold on. Hold on. Kind of was doing it.

570
02:25:13,450 --> 02:25:44,600
Come on, do it. Is there a refund timer going? I'm way past that. All right. Let me think if I were

571
02:25:44,600 --> 02:25:54,709
to, it needs to go boom, boom. So I mean, once you start drawing, it just drops. So there's,

572
02:25:54,709 --> 02:25:59,399
I wish I could freeze stuff. I wish I could like hold something here, but I can't. So it has to,

573
02:25:59,399 --> 02:26:08,389
when you start a drawing, you got to go from the ground up. So like, what if I do this?

574
02:26:08,389 --> 02:26:16,629
Like just block it so it can only go to this area here and then just knock it somehow. And what if

575
02:26:16,629 --> 02:26:21,540
I just drop a, what if I just dropped this on here? Like just go poink. Not going to help.

576
02:26:24,010 --> 02:26:42,489
We can't hear the music again. Right there. I mean, I just, I just don't, I, I don't know.

577
02:26:42,489 --> 02:27:03,579
There's no dodge roll in this game. I can't play it. Um, what is this? Make the balloon touch the

578
02:27:03,579 --> 02:27:32,870
left wall. I think that's what they want me to do. Maybe just little bits. I hate this game and I'm

579
02:27:32,870 --> 02:27:44,059
not even playing it. We're fine. Make the balls touch the red areas. These have to spin. Let's

580
02:27:44,059 --> 02:27:52,649
just see what happens if I go right in the middle. Well, that's how you get it done.

581
02:27:52,649 --> 02:28:07,620
Give the girl the balloon. Oh, you mean a crusher with a rock. Oops. Uh, can I,

582
02:28:07,620 --> 02:28:54,760
I can't put anything in here. Oh, I can. Oh, I did it. What's going on? Pick, touch,

583
02:28:54,760 --> 02:29:08,090
pick up the balloon. What's happening? What is going on? What, what the hell was that?

584
02:29:08,090 --> 02:30:01,000
Why won't you stay? Stay. There we go. All right. Make the ball touch both red areas.

585
02:30:01,510 --> 02:30:19,899
Ex, excuse me. Somebody said lower the game volume. Is it allowed? Make the ball touch both.

586
02:30:19,899 --> 02:31:09,270
Excuse me. Looks like it's time for a fulcrum. That's right. Good call.

587
02:31:24,100 --> 02:31:48,780
I'm fine. I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble. How do I get this to bounce? There it is.

588
02:31:48,780 --> 02:32:11,239
Do that quick thinking right there. Make the balloons fly away. Just wait probably, right?

589
02:32:11,239 --> 02:32:26,709
I imagine it's probably something like that. Yeah, there it goes. This game is addicting.

590
02:32:26,709 --> 02:33:07,690
Release the balloon. Make the red ball touch the left wall. Why does it keep saying red?

591
02:33:07,690 --> 02:33:23,559
Nice fulcrum, bro. I got it. Okay. Pull the bottle cap out. Easy. That's when I got this one done.

592
02:33:23,559 --> 02:33:52,489
This one's in completely cashed. I didn't know the bottle was going to fall. Study this guy's brain.

593
02:33:52,489 --> 02:34:02,010
Someone's trying to beat you in a race of the game. I'm not racing anybody. I'm playing

594
02:34:02,010 --> 02:34:12,649
casually on my own time. This does not say, Hey, there's a, I'm, I'm racing right now. Red ball.

595
02:34:12,729 --> 02:34:43,299
Okay. I got an idea with this one. Have your thirties been better than your twenties?

596
02:34:43,299 --> 02:34:52,489
Um, that's a good question because I feel like in your twenties, you're kind of figuring out

597
02:34:52,489 --> 02:35:01,819
who you are. And in your thirties, you kind of know who that is. I got an idea here. Hold on.

598
02:35:01,819 --> 02:35:08,379
Watch this. Ready? This is going to be like a golf club. That's the right idea. Hold on.

599
02:35:08,379 --> 02:35:23,979
Well, that was dumb. I think the rock has to be bigger and then this has to go all the way.

600
02:35:23,979 --> 02:36:04,500
And then that's it right there. Keep pulling it. Close. Yeah. I mean, I honestly, I feel like since

601
02:36:04,500 --> 02:36:14,040
I turned say like 35 or so, you kind of, I kind of just know exactly what I'm, what I want to do

602
02:36:14,040 --> 02:36:19,559
and who that person is and who I am. In your twenties, you're really kind of still figuring

603
02:36:19,559 --> 02:36:26,729
out like, Hey, what exactly am I doing with myself? I've said this before. It's, it's not a race. So

604
02:36:26,729 --> 02:36:33,579
I know a lot of people in this channel are in their twenties. Um, it's not a race. Don't think

605
02:36:33,579 --> 02:36:40,790
it is. I didn't figure out shit until I was well into my late twenties, early thirties. And still,

606
02:36:40,790 --> 02:36:44,489
I'm still figuring out. I mean, look, I don't know how to do the f*****g Thagorean theorem here.

607
02:36:44,489 --> 02:37:16,219
That's it right there. Oh, this needs to be so much heavier. Yeah. Maybe it's too heavy.

608
02:37:16,219 --> 02:37:31,690
Maybe this needs to be heavier. Wait a minute. Hold on. Watch this. Now, theoretically,

609
02:37:31,690 --> 02:38:39,110
I don't have a theory at all. S**t. S**t. It's right there. God damn it. Do it already. All right.

610
02:38:39,110 --> 02:38:44,219
That pulls it. I think I got it. I think that's the one. I remember what that looks like.

611
02:38:49,180 --> 02:39:03,239
Go like this up right here and then that here and then boot it. I think that's it. It wasn't,

612
02:39:03,239 --> 02:39:26,170
that's too long, but all right. That's the right idea. S**t. Still too long. Have a big exam next

613
02:39:26,170 --> 02:39:37,059
week. Wish me luck. I studied. Good luck. I've learned since the last time somebody said little

614
02:39:37,059 --> 02:39:42,659
bro can't just say good luck to somebody. He has to go on a 15 minute rant about like pot pies and

615
02:39:42,659 --> 02:39:59,180
stuff. I heard it. So I'm, I'm doing it differently now. F**k. It needs to be like a bend. I don't know

616
02:39:59,180 --> 02:40:07,020
anything about this. We all do different things. Okay. If you're like, Oh, I know how to do this and

617
02:40:07,020 --> 02:40:33,209
do that. That's good. I'm glad you know how to do it. I'm a tinkerer. There's a difference. You want

618
02:40:33,209 --> 02:40:38,569
the thing to fall to the right, but keep building it up against the right wall. Dude. I know this

619
02:40:38,569 --> 02:40:53,370
just at the zoo right now. I need to like bend it. I don't know. Move the ball first. I mean,

620
02:40:53,370 --> 02:42:18,920
I guess I could move the ball first. Oh my God. No, stop. Move. Finish breath of the wild. Do you

621
02:42:18,920 --> 02:42:22,360
suck at this game? You just added it three more weeks to when I'm going to play breath of the

622
02:42:22,360 --> 02:43:18,500
wild. Remember that I need to remember this exact thing that I just did. I already forgot it. I

623
02:43:18,500 --> 02:43:42,809
forgot it already. I wasn't even paying attention. Object permanence. I just not burning anything into

624
02:43:42,809 --> 02:43:49,659
short term memory because I'm about to put a hole through my monitor. It's really hard before,

625
02:43:49,659 --> 02:43:53,739
you know, before you like, you know, put your head, but the monitor, it's hard to be like,

626
02:43:53,739 --> 02:44:13,129
Oh yeah. I like just like pay attention more. Why don't you ever headbutt a monitor? Oh,

627
02:44:13,129 --> 02:44:19,860
I can't believe I'm up against. I'm up against. Oh, what's the character from League of Legends?

628
02:44:19,860 --> 02:44:33,770
I can't even name one rise. What's his name? Oh shit. What's the, what's the, what's the

629
02:44:33,770 --> 02:44:44,969
character's name? Oh yeah. It is rise. Oh fuck. I'm going against rise mid. Fuck dude. It's over.

630
02:44:44,969 --> 02:45:19,989
I'm going to lose. Not from the music. All right. First of all, do this first.

631
02:45:19,989 --> 02:45:31,450
I had it. Then it's like here and then like dip. And then I did this. I think that's what I did.

632
02:45:31,450 --> 02:45:37,860
Did I not do it like that? That was a career ending joke. I've done like a thousand of those.

633
02:45:38,579 --> 02:45:58,409
So I don't think so. I wish I could draw more than once and not have everything just start to move

634
02:45:58,409 --> 02:46:02,010
when I'm done painting. I wish it was a button I could press that was like, okay, start the physics

635
02:46:02,010 --> 02:46:28,100
now. I don't care. You can't have everything. Have your brother Dave do it for you. I would bet

636
02:46:28,100 --> 02:46:32,600
that half of you guys wouldn't be able to do even a third of the ones that I'm doing. Is that,

637
02:46:32,600 --> 02:46:36,680
do you think that's correct? I would bet that. I bet a third of the people there probably couldn't

638
02:46:36,680 --> 02:46:51,659
do even half of these. What do you think? Are this a third? Do you think 30% of 20,000 people?

639
02:46:51,659 --> 02:46:58,629
Probably a few thousand, right? And who cares? All right. Let's release. Let's do that. I got

640
02:46:58,629 --> 02:47:27,209
an idea already. You know what's going on. He's free. Okay. Let's put on pizza. Pizza.

641
02:47:31,659 --> 02:47:45,739
Pizza tower. Why not? Hook the balloon on the dot. Hmm. Well, how the heck do I do that?

642
02:47:45,739 --> 02:48:07,299
This is a great soundtrack. Yeah, there it is. Turn it up. It can be kind of low.

643
02:48:07,299 --> 02:48:13,959
Doesn't have to be super loud. What the hell is that? I lost everything. I lost my chat.

644
02:48:21,180 --> 02:48:27,100
There we go. Does anybody know how to turn off that feature of windows, which I don't,

645
02:48:27,100 --> 02:48:34,059
I don't understand why it was ever implemented. You ever have like, I've got like eight windows open

646
02:48:34,950 --> 02:48:40,309
and then like I for some reason clicked and dragged and moved to a spot on one of the monitors

647
02:48:40,950 --> 02:48:48,500
that just minimizes every fucking single window. What, what were they doing when they made that a

648
02:48:48,500 --> 02:48:54,229
thing? Oh, Hey, I'm just like moving a wind. I'm moving one of my windows. Uh, maybe a little too

649
02:48:54,229 --> 02:49:05,450
close to the stop. Just minimize every single window you were working on. Oh, this is a good

650
02:49:05,450 --> 02:49:50,600
idea. No, I didn't want to let go. Whoops. I've skirted out. I want to freeze it here because

651
02:49:50,600 --> 02:50:03,659
when I let go, it's just everything falls. Actually, this is probably the way to do it.

652
02:50:03,659 --> 02:50:33,209
Now I have to turn it on first. Why would you get stuck here? Of all places, you were just moving

653
02:50:33,209 --> 02:51:14,620
up the line. What stopped you? That, well, I thought, okay, it has to stay on there. Oh,

654
02:51:14,620 --> 02:51:27,100
this is going to be fucking hard. This actually will be very difficult. Oh man. Okay. How tall is

655
02:51:27,100 --> 02:51:57,379
this? I'm trying to make it so it doesn't fly away. Okay. Can I do anything now that I did this? The

656
02:51:57,379 --> 02:52:28,940
hook has collision. I mean, the goal now is I'm trying to like that. Oh, do it already. It's too

657
02:52:28,940 --> 02:52:56,729
low. I think it should get it right there. Latch, latch. Oh, no, it's too low. You're right. Damn it.

658
02:52:56,729 --> 02:53:23,930
Okay. All right. We're good. Now I got to figure out how to just knock it this way. You fucking

659
02:53:23,930 --> 02:53:45,979
idiot. You idiot. You idiot. I've uninstalled games for fewer less than this. That's why I

660
02:53:45,979 --> 02:54:05,879
want to let you know. It's in the right spot. Should I just like make a, just go like this

661
02:54:05,879 --> 02:54:43,209
and like drag it this way? No. Wait, it's going, it's going. Shit. It's right here. Come on. Oh my

662
02:54:43,209 --> 02:54:58,219
God. Fucking asshole. Get on there. Dude, I look, there is plenty of space. This is absolute

663
02:54:58,219 --> 02:55:18,020
bullshit. Why can I not draw here? It's fucking me up. Big time. I'm going to get this. It's so

664
02:55:18,020 --> 02:55:33,239
close. It's right here. This hurts to watch. This hurts to play. Just in case you're wondering.

665
02:55:33,239 --> 02:56:02,500
Shit. No, I want it to stay there. Actually might work out. You can solve this with one line.

666
02:56:02,500 --> 02:56:08,469
You're talking about like, do this. You have to activate it and then go like this. So it floats

667
02:56:08,469 --> 02:56:14,200
over and gets hooked on it. But the problem is the balloon doesn't want to move anymore.

668
02:56:14,200 --> 02:56:31,459
Do a ramp with a hook. Have it go through the string. I mean like this. So we'll drag it up.

669
02:56:31,459 --> 02:56:39,129
No. Stir beat every level. You're going to let him win. Stir did not beat 1200 levels.

670
02:56:40,840 --> 02:56:59,959
I stir probably played this for 20 minutes and then just left and moved on. I'm going to duck.

671
02:56:59,959 --> 02:57:41,299
All that matters. I don't care. Oh, that moves. Okay. Hold on. I quit. I'm taking the IQ test

672
02:57:41,299 --> 02:58:05,450
instead. Use the mouse to draw shapes. Click on the, don't judge me based on what you're about to

673
02:58:05,450 --> 02:58:16,260
see because it's not fair. It's actually completely, it's going to be completely unfair. Okay. Click

674
02:58:16,260 --> 02:58:24,700
on the IQ icon for a comprehensive diagnosis. It is recommended that as many of the 20 tasks

675
02:58:24,700 --> 02:58:31,059
be completed as possible. Okay. All right. Put your drawing into the beaker. You cannot draw

676
02:58:31,059 --> 02:59:05,899
in the blue area. Okay. So we're going to make a, we're going to make like a bridge. Oh, I was

677
02:59:05,899 --> 02:59:11,049
trying to, can I restart it? Cause I was trying, I was, I was, I was trying to make it. I, this is

678
02:59:11,049 --> 02:59:21,610
why I want, I wish I could just fucking like, you know what I was trying to do here? That's what I

679
02:59:21,610 --> 02:59:36,489
was trying to do, but like I, it fucked up. Get in there. All right. There it is. I, I, this should

680
02:59:36,489 --> 02:59:48,500
have been two tries. Make the red ball touch the red area. Let me think about this for a second

681
02:59:48,579 --> 02:59:59,940
before everybody screams. You got an 80. That's 80 IQ. No, no, that's, we have to wait for the

682
02:59:59,940 --> 03:00:07,659
assessment. By the way, you're taking time away from my IQ test. I need to touch the red area.

683
03:00:07,659 --> 03:00:22,549
Okay. Oh, I thought this thing just saying I was an idiot. All right. So let's think about it.

684
03:00:22,549 --> 03:00:31,670
I'm going to have to knock this forward. It is not to go in here. It's to go here. So let's start

685
03:00:32,120 --> 03:00:48,700
by going like this. It's got to be steep enough where it can make it like that. Okay. I also need

686
03:00:48,700 --> 03:01:24,659
to go. I need a ramp here. So it goes, I think that should do it. Like, you know what I was going for

687
03:01:24,659 --> 03:01:31,620
that is my, is my IQ bad because drawing with a mouse sucks. No, that's not intelligence. That's

688
03:01:31,620 --> 03:01:52,969
drawing with a mouse sucks. You might get there. You've had practice though, two hours of practice.

689
03:01:52,969 --> 03:01:59,420
You need to do 10,000 hours of something to be a fucking good at it. I'm not even close to being

690
03:01:59,420 --> 03:02:23,979
there. Here we go. How was that better than the first one? Draw something and touch the red area.

691
03:02:23,979 --> 03:02:58,780
Okay. So it's got a drop over here. So it's going to make a, like a little tower, right? There we go.

692
03:02:58,780 --> 03:03:55,000
What's that? 130 IQ. What's yours? Make the red square touch the left wall. Come on. I didn't mean

693
03:03:55,000 --> 03:04:57,690
to do that. I, how do I, that's what the fulcrum was. I would have had it this one. I'm going to

694
03:04:57,690 --> 03:05:23,000
get like two IQ on this one. I didn't, why did I even make that thing? Fucking smash this thing.

695
03:05:23,000 --> 03:06:11,479
Push it all the way. Come on. What did I get? That's fine. I'm not doing my IQ assessment yet.

696
03:06:11,479 --> 03:06:39,100
Go already. I did this one first try before. Shit. 130. Red ball, touch the red area. Watch this.

697
03:06:39,100 --> 03:06:52,729
First try. Whoa. I forgot that it doesn't stay. That's my fault for not remembering. I think I

698
03:06:52,729 --> 03:07:55,180
still might be all right. Play Street Fighter. Um, no, I fucked it up. That's too big. That's

699
03:07:55,180 --> 03:08:12,889
got to be it. Hey, 110 IQ. Get out of here. Draw something and touch the red area. Oh,

700
03:08:12,889 --> 03:08:31,940
I see what's going on here. Uh, I don't got it. Oh, not like this. What do you think I was doing?

701
03:08:31,940 --> 03:08:38,969
I made the T specifically for that. Have only one snowflake in the container. Um, we, I didn't know

702
03:08:38,969 --> 03:08:55,739
that's what you, whoa. I think I just got it. Oh, come on. Get over there. Oh, 170 IQ. Lower the

703
03:08:55,739 --> 03:09:41,530
coat hanger. Retry. Where are the fulcrums? I don't need them right now. I'm fine as we are.

704
03:09:41,530 --> 03:10:03,049
Lower the coat hanger. All right. So I wanted, I needed to spin this way. I got an idea. Really?

705
03:10:03,049 --> 03:10:49,290
The momentum is not going to work. I think I hate him. You wouldn't do this in the, you would not

706
03:10:49,290 --> 03:10:53,850
do this in the amount of time I'm doing it. You wouldn't do this. You wouldn't do this in the same

707
03:10:53,850 --> 03:10:58,649
amount of time. You wouldn't do it. You wouldn't be able to do it in the same amount of time.

708
03:10:58,729 --> 03:11:46,299
You wouldn't do it. You wouldn't be able to do it. Get off, dude. Are you kidding me?

709
03:11:46,299 --> 03:12:02,739
There are engineers and architects in chat. Unlatch it. That's technically unlatched.

710
03:12:02,739 --> 03:12:10,899
There it is. There actually might be. That was 130. That one was a hard one.

711
03:12:10,899 --> 03:12:23,100
The yellow ball will start moving when something touches it. Put the balls in the cup.

712
03:12:23,100 --> 03:13:40,760
Salvageable. Oh my God. What the fuck? Are you trolling, dude? I don't, do you really think I

713
03:13:40,760 --> 03:13:46,579
would be able to do that if I tried? If I really tried, do you think I would be able to put pixel

714
03:13:46,579 --> 03:14:11,420
perfect capture that ball where it was? Stop trolling, dude. Two lines, dude. I'm begging you.

715
03:14:11,420 --> 03:14:19,739
I got it right here. See, I didn't know. Okay. I didn't know they had collision. I thought that

716
03:14:19,739 --> 03:14:24,329
they could go through each other. I did it. And that one was a hundred IQ. So I'll take the

717
03:14:24,329 --> 03:14:31,399
complaints. Throw Alex up 10 meters. I know how to do that. I did it accidentally like five times

718
03:14:31,399 --> 03:15:04,729
already. I guess that's 25 meters. I got, that's not even 20 IQ. What? How was it? That's a worse

719
03:15:04,729 --> 03:15:39,049
one so far. Take the ball out. Play new music. The music's playing right now. You can definitely

720
03:15:39,049 --> 03:16:05,180
hear it. I'm almost done with my IQ test. This will be it right here. 120. Almost done. Don't

721
03:16:05,180 --> 03:17:13,180
let the cup touch the ground. What cup? Don't let the cup touch the ground. Oh, I have to turn this

722
03:17:13,180 --> 03:19:09,459
up. Okay.

723
03:20:00,139 --> 03:21:05,379
Let's go. Come on. Does that work? There it is. Make the beaker touch the red area. You know what

724
03:21:05,379 --> 03:21:43,659
we're doing. You know what we're doing. You ready? Shit. Oh, he's fucking laughing. That's like,

725
03:21:44,219 --> 03:22:25,930
dude, your fulcrum sucks. Hey, leave my fulcrum alone. There we go. This is it. Yeah. Yeah.

726
03:22:45,979 --> 03:23:52,680
Oh, come on. Really? Oh, 40, 40. This thing is heavy. This thing is heavy.

727
03:23:53,239 --> 03:24:12,489
Bang. Got to place the ball on the other side of the. Okay. Check this out.

728
03:26:10,600 --> 03:26:30,280
I have to like whack it over there. You're the most interesting mind in the world.

729
03:26:30,280 --> 03:26:36,299
I have to whack it through here. You need a fucking fulcrum already.

730
03:26:36,299 --> 03:26:43,540
Don't tell me when I do and do not need to fulcrum. Hey, this is a conversation between

731
03:26:44,440 --> 03:26:49,079
A and B you're talking. Seize the next letter and fucking get out of here.

732
03:26:49,079 --> 03:27:19,940
You know what I'm saying? I keep winning apparently. What do I keep winning? Okay.

733
03:27:19,940 --> 03:27:50,629
I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing this for.

734
03:27:50,629 --> 03:27:56,229
I was trying to make a ceiling to fuck. I don't know why I made this.

735
03:28:09,350 --> 03:28:12,069
Ceiling for what? So it didn't launch? I don't know. To guide it.

736
03:28:14,500 --> 03:28:17,379
You literally had the idea. The right idea for the wrong side.

737
03:28:18,819 --> 03:28:52,139
I get a good fulcrum here. Why do you keep doing that? I don't know how you get this ball to go

738
03:28:52,139 --> 03:29:00,389
in this hole. You know, it would be okay. Let it do it. Go. It's the line's too thick. I mean,

739
03:29:00,389 --> 03:29:37,219
I don't know. I have to like get it to hit this way. How big does this gotta be better than that?

740
03:29:37,219 --> 03:29:41,459
Catapult, catapult, catapult. Yeah, I know. So it has to be launched from this side.

741
03:29:41,459 --> 03:29:51,500
But how the fuck? You can make it with one line. The line is the fulcrum.

742
03:29:53,100 --> 03:29:55,899
Don't let these clowns bully you. Just do your best.

743
03:29:56,620 --> 03:30:02,139
If they were still VIPs, I would VIP you for five. You know what I mean? All right.

744
03:30:02,940 --> 03:30:10,620
So it needs to, the ball needs to fall here and needs to launch from this side that way.

745
03:30:11,260 --> 03:30:15,670
That's gonna be such a, this is gonna be impossible. Just make a half pipe.

746
03:30:22,600 --> 03:30:39,260
That didn't even want it to go that way. I don't think this is ever gonna work like this.

747
03:30:40,059 --> 03:31:53,690
Maybe like support beams. I'll just make a hook at some point, right? Oh, what? That actually kind of

748
03:31:53,690 --> 03:32:58,969
worked. Fall that way. The weight is on the right side. There's no weight over here. Look at how

749
03:32:58,969 --> 03:33:05,209
heavy this fucking thing is. I don't know anything about leverage. Because I don't even know how to

750
03:33:05,209 --> 03:33:22,389
change a tire. I have no idea how to do that. Guess what? None of you do either. None of us do.

751
03:33:25,139 --> 03:33:38,809
It's a, that's a big problem, isn't it? The best part about this is if I can't do something,

752
03:33:38,809 --> 03:33:54,569
just say everybody else can either. That's how I get, how I feel better. This is the kind of

753
03:33:54,569 --> 03:34:00,469
shit that you go to like school for eight years to do all this. So you can fucking figure out this

754
03:34:00,469 --> 03:34:29,799
puzzle correctly. It's closer. How is this not weigh so much more? Like the weight thing,

755
03:34:29,799 --> 03:34:39,959
I don't understand. I made a ball and it does, it's not heavy. This ball is fucking massive.

756
03:34:39,959 --> 03:34:59,290
How is this not pulling down so hard? Get in there. Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.

757
03:34:59,850 --> 03:35:24,200
I can bump it in there, can't I? Yes. Make the ball touch the left wall. Uh, okay. Seems kind

758
03:35:24,200 --> 03:36:06,629
of easy. Thought this would be kind of a hard one. Okay. Hold on. So I have to touch this. I guess I

759
03:36:06,629 --> 03:36:09,750
could just touch it with something that never hits the ground over here. So I go like this,

760
03:36:10,549 --> 03:36:18,459
but it's not like this is going to be a big, right? Like who cares? Well, I had it just hook this,

761
03:36:19,260 --> 03:36:52,569
have it go like this. Is it going to stand? All right. Wait a second. What are you doing?

762
03:36:52,569 --> 03:37:12,440
I'm listening to pizza tower. What happens if I fill this? What will this do? I just want to see

763
03:37:12,440 --> 03:37:29,450
what happens. Okay. So you're only 18 in, in three and a half hours, bro. This is like the

764
03:37:29,450 --> 03:37:51,829
fourth game mode I've played. You got to go back and watch the fog. Okay. Hold on a second.

765
03:37:52,389 --> 03:38:23,959
How's this for some fucking IQ? How's that for a little bit of IQ? How's that going to work?

766
03:38:25,780 --> 03:39:07,239
Two more. That did not work. I forgot it falls. Um, I have to like, okay. So here's the weird part.

767
03:39:07,879 --> 03:39:13,479
I have to activate it first because it won't pull it when I, uh, I have to turn it on first.

768
03:39:14,200 --> 03:39:37,719
I can do that. I mean, could I effectively just put balls in here and pump it that way? Okay. So

769
03:39:37,719 --> 03:39:46,459
I got an idea. We're just, we're just hooking for a second. Hold on. I said that needs to go the

770
03:39:46,459 --> 03:40:33,879
other way. Okay. Got to go all the way around. Boom. Shit. Right idea, but the wrong placement.

771
03:40:36,809 --> 03:40:46,489
I almost think I could make a ramp. I go, what if I go like this and then what if I go like that

772
03:40:48,299 --> 03:41:12,780
then like this? Nevermind. Actually might help. Hold on a minute. Not at all. So how do I get

773
03:41:12,780 --> 03:41:22,649
this to spin completely almost 180 degrees this way or this way? Well, I can't, it's not going

774
03:41:22,649 --> 03:41:39,420
to be able to ever go this way. So it has to go flip to the left. It has to wait a minute. Okay.

775
03:41:39,420 --> 03:42:20,500
Hold on. Okay. That's kind of cheating, but that kind of works. Oh, we're almost there. Look now.

776
03:42:20,500 --> 03:42:53,700
I just have to go like that and it's gotta be like harsher. It's gotta be like a sharp point,

777
03:42:53,700 --> 03:43:27,610
maybe lower. There it is. Let's knock it this way and I'm done. It'll bounce back. It'll bounce back.

778
03:43:27,610 --> 03:43:50,149
Ah, all right. Now we just wait. He didn't read chat. Surely the chat, but I was just talking to

779
03:43:50,149 --> 03:44:07,909
my mom. I know this is bad. This is salvageable. Okay. Now we just have to pull it back this way

780
03:44:07,909 --> 03:45:01,780
and it should be good. You know what we're doing. It's definitely high enough where I can. No,

781
03:45:01,780 --> 03:45:20,940
I can't. All right. Now cut the shit and just move it. Just pull it this way. Grab this and hook it

782
03:45:20,940 --> 03:45:40,090
over here. Finally. Now just move that. Oh, this'll do it. All right. This is the last one. And then

783
03:45:40,090 --> 03:47:12,440
we'll see what my actual IQ is. Wolfram Frank. This is it. This is going to be it right here.

784
03:47:12,440 --> 03:48:31,129
Check it out. This is it. Just flip it. That's what I was trying to do.

785
03:48:31,129 --> 03:50:24,729
I think it's close enough. There it is. All right. Let's go. So I'm there. I'm right there.

786
03:50:24,729 --> 03:50:51,379
This is an AI learning program. Yeah. And guess what? That AI does this shit like 50 million times

787
03:50:51,379 --> 03:51:06,229
before it understands it. Dude, you're poisoning the data right now. I'm fine. I just, I don't,

788
03:51:06,309 --> 03:51:13,590
I don't know. Anytime, anytime the word pulley lever or hook is in the conversation,

789
03:51:14,309 --> 03:51:19,049
I'm talking about Star Wars with three or four other people in the room. You know what I'm saying?

790
03:51:20,389 --> 03:51:29,000
Like I very much enjoy gardening. You know what I mean? I like a garden. I can tell you about

791
03:51:29,000 --> 03:51:38,780
gardening. Fertilize, how to fertilize. Well, I don't, I don't know about pulleys. I don't know

792
03:51:38,780 --> 03:51:47,270
about weight distributions, forklift things. I don't know that. That's a skill. That's a skill.

793
03:51:47,670 --> 03:52:00,969
That's a really, that's a skill that you have to learn. What is the perfect pH value in water

794
03:52:00,969 --> 03:52:06,469
for cannabis plants? I don't grow cannabis, but I can't answer that question. Nice. Gotcha though.

795
03:52:07,030 --> 03:52:54,760
All right. We're doing it my way. I really expect us to believe you just grow in sunflowers and

796
03:52:54,760 --> 03:53:06,280
never delved into the devil's plant. Um, I like marijuana. I don't grow marijuana. How do I,

797
03:53:06,280 --> 03:53:13,000
how do I get out of here? How do I figure this out? I can't figure out how to do all the shit to

798
03:53:13,000 --> 03:53:20,940
twist and pull and grab and what about like this? This is stupid. It's like a dumb idea.

799
03:53:27,219 --> 03:53:38,819
What if I just do this and then drop a ball here and just flip it? Does that work? It grips it

800
03:53:38,819 --> 03:53:44,260
correctly. Theoretically should. I think radically. My hypothesis is this looks like it's going pretty

801
03:53:44,260 --> 03:55:08,500
well. Okay. Deduction. Deduced. Pick it up with your hand. Let's do some sess with focrums. Um,

802
03:55:10,729 --> 03:55:17,139
I did this one before. I don't, it's like grabbing it, having it be like up, left,

803
03:55:17,139 --> 03:55:23,459
down, up, weight, counterweight, counterweight this way. No, I don't, I don't, I have no idea.

804
03:55:24,020 --> 03:55:55,129
I just want to just tip it, but it won't do it because I'm trying to make a hook,

805
03:55:55,129 --> 03:56:01,049
but eventually it's too big because I can only draw a certain size. All right. Well, hold on.

806
03:56:01,690 --> 03:56:21,909
Is it now possible for me to pull this and I just whack this now? This is it. This has to be it.

807
03:56:28,920 --> 03:56:58,950
Everybody say a prayer because this is it. This is question 20. Fuck you. Ha, you can't make it

808
03:56:58,950 --> 03:57:32,250
small enough for it to dip. Dip the shit. I didn't, I didn't even mean to do it, but I just solved it.

809
03:57:32,250 --> 03:57:58,309
I just made a makeshift fulcrum. I didn't even mean to solve it. I don't know. Okay. What about

810
03:57:58,309 --> 03:58:35,159
this? Like, no, I wish I could just change how big the painter is. All right. What the fuck?

811
03:58:35,159 --> 03:58:43,420
Why is your chat so toxic? Um, I don't, are you guys toxic? Yes or no. This is a yes or no question.

812
03:58:45,049 --> 03:58:49,129
Are you guys toxic? Yes or no. And I want you to be honest.

813
03:58:50,680 --> 03:58:58,809
Knows you saying yes. Work on that. Work on that. I ain't going to say it again. Work on that.

814
03:58:59,370 --> 03:59:14,979
It kind of looks like a nose. Okay. So what a big stick in a box at the end.

815
03:59:15,700 --> 03:59:32,629
That might work. Work on being even more toxic. Now you got me angry. I've been hanging out,

816
03:59:32,629 --> 03:59:37,110
just chilling, playing this game. Now you've really, really pissed me off. Are you ready?

817
03:59:37,909 --> 04:00:09,690
I'm going to beat this on the next try because of that. I just, I just don't get it. I know a lot of

818
04:00:09,690 --> 04:00:16,520
people will probably get it. And they're like, dude, I get it. I don't get it. I would get it

819
04:00:16,520 --> 04:00:33,139
if I could shrink the paint brush. I don't get it. Have you seen the new butt hole emoji? No,

820
04:00:33,139 --> 04:01:20,170
I haven't. I hope it makes you happy. You do you. How do I do this? Actually, I'm like completely

821
04:01:20,170 --> 04:01:26,889
stumped. I don't, I don't, I don't get how you can make a hook that can pull it down without

822
04:01:26,889 --> 04:01:37,020
hitting the ground and have it go all the way over. I guess that's kind of correct. Maybe just

823
04:01:37,020 --> 04:01:58,139
hold on and try that again. It's too big. Everything's too big. I can't make it smaller.

824
04:01:58,780 --> 04:02:22,600
If I could make the hook part smaller, it's kind of correct. What if I, is this a stupid idea?

825
04:02:23,319 --> 04:02:40,899
Kind of. Go the other way with the weight facing the other side. I don't know how far out I should

826
04:02:40,899 --> 04:02:54,170
go. How far should I do it? Oh, that's kind of an idea. It's not a bad idea. I think I'll get it

827
04:02:54,170 --> 04:03:35,420
doing this. Is that enough space? Oh, it's almost like it needs that gap there. It's close. It's so

828
04:03:35,420 --> 04:04:16,819
close, but it's not going to do it. Can I just bump it? I'm going back to this. This is like a brace

829
04:04:16,819 --> 04:04:38,180
for it and then maybe it'll just flip over. Wait, fulcrum, left side fulcrum. I need to lift the

830
04:04:38,180 --> 04:04:56,540
left one. What if I do it thin? Look at how thin that is. All right. All right. You got a thin crust

831
04:04:56,540 --> 04:05:01,319
or thicker crust for pizza. Get them distracted so they stop, you know, making fun of me.

832
04:05:01,319 --> 04:05:33,899
Okay. And now let's really get at some momentum. Go. Oh my God. There it is. I don't want to freak

833
04:05:33,899 --> 04:06:00,500
out, but I think I'm in trouble. I kind of need to hit it again. Yes. It was correct. All right.

834
04:06:00,500 --> 04:06:32,659
It's time to get the results. My IQ is, you ready? What's the song I need? What's this? What's the

835
04:06:32,659 --> 04:06:38,100
song? I'm going to drag this out. What's the song when Saitama is going to punch somebody

836
04:06:38,100 --> 04:06:39,299
in One Punch Man and it goes,

837
04:06:44,659 --> 04:06:54,020
what's it called? I'm going to do the thing where I play an epic song and reveal it. What's it called?

838
04:06:54,020 --> 04:07:19,659
Saitama's theme. Is this it? I don't hear anything. I don't hear it. I don't hear anything.

839
04:07:19,659 --> 04:07:37,670
That's weird. Do you think it's over or under a hundred? Oh, there we go. Now I can hear.

840
04:07:37,670 --> 04:07:42,069
All right. Is it over or under a hundred? You guys ready? Here comes the epic thing.

841
04:07:42,069 --> 04:07:59,930
So I took an IQ test today and it made me understand that it doesn't matter if you're good

842
04:07:59,930 --> 04:08:02,809
at puzzles. It doesn't matter if you can dodge a battle X. It doesn't matter if you can fight

843
04:08:02,809 --> 04:08:13,579
anybody. We're all strong inside. We all have what it takes. Whatever is underneath this,

844
04:08:13,579 --> 04:08:17,420
it doesn't matter what it is. It could be 50. It could be a hundred. It could be 150,

845
04:08:17,420 --> 04:08:23,020
which would make me better than all of you. Way better. But even if it does say that,

846
04:08:23,659 --> 04:08:31,620
it could be 20, but it's not going to be. It's time to reveal the IQ. And again,

847
04:08:31,620 --> 04:08:57,940
don't be discouraged when you see this number. Really? All right. I'll take it.

848
04:08:59,370 --> 04:09:12,659
That's better than average. Nice radio station. That's my name. Well, it was under a hundred.

849
04:09:14,379 --> 04:09:33,510
Oh, I did. You guys didn't. Oh, okay. Oh, shit. All right. But, uh, okay. Here we go.

850
04:09:33,510 --> 04:10:09,319
I wanted this one. Is this this one? There it is. All right. So that's nine, nine, eight, five.

851
04:10:09,319 --> 04:10:15,579
Cool. That was fun. So what efficiency? That's okay. Let's go over it. Comprehension.

852
04:10:15,579 --> 04:10:20,059
The ability to understand where to apply force to control the position and angle of an object.

853
04:10:20,059 --> 04:10:31,129
I know how to fucking punch really, really fucking hard. You understand? Insight. Wise

854
04:10:31,129 --> 04:10:44,790
enough to see that it is actually simple. That's all right. That's fine. I just like choked.

855
04:10:44,790 --> 04:10:53,719
Inspiration. Eye-opening thinking. That's all right. Aggressive sensations that generate

856
04:10:53,719 --> 04:11:00,979
large movements with strong force. Efficiency. The shrewdness of having multiple functions in

857
04:11:00,979 --> 04:11:11,209
one object. You give me a stick and that's that I use that stick to swing at people

858
04:11:11,209 --> 04:11:19,860
in the caveman lands. I'm not going to make it a tool, but I'll tell you,

859
04:11:19,860 --> 04:11:37,850
I can comprehend what I can comprehend a stick. It's so funny. All right. I'm right at the top

860
04:11:37,850 --> 04:11:44,969
of the curve. This is normal. This is normal. Humans are here. Okay. I'm very, it's average.

861
04:11:45,530 --> 04:11:53,620
I never told you I was a super intelligent person. I mean, I feel like I think it used to be over.

862
04:11:53,620 --> 04:12:01,979
This is not a real IQ test. Why am I acting like it is? The number is your username. Yeah.

863
04:12:01,979 --> 04:12:16,979
German985. You're one point below average. Whatever. You said it was going to be higher

864
04:12:16,979 --> 04:12:45,180
than all of us. Don't be discouraged. I'm 128. No, that's good. 130 is better, but 28 is all right.

865
04:12:45,180 --> 04:12:58,180
I want to see a couple other things though. That chatter is a genius. All right. What is this?

866
04:12:58,180 --> 04:13:06,020
The blue ball will shrink when touched. Make it go touch the ground. That's when you have 100 IQ.

867
04:13:06,020 --> 04:13:19,670
That's how you figure it out real fast. Make them fit. We need some more music. Man, I love that

868
04:13:19,670 --> 04:13:30,120
Saitama song. Don't you? I don't even like, you know what I mean? Oh, you know what I mean, Vern?

869
04:13:30,120 --> 04:13:38,739
Don't bat-chest me. No, actually don't bat-chest me. That song is great. That's an amazingly composed

870
04:13:38,739 --> 04:13:47,750
song. The composition in that. I know composition. You just saw that I do. It's phenomenally crafted.

871
04:13:47,750 --> 04:14:11,739
I know how to crap things. All right. So you got to go quick. I need a new OST. Did you put your IQ

872
04:14:11,739 --> 04:14:25,100
in your username? That's cringe. German98.5. Ocarina of Time. I did say I was going to do

873
04:14:25,100 --> 04:14:40,579
Animal Crossing. That's right. You guys having fun? You having fun? Hey, you having a good time?

874
04:14:40,579 --> 04:15:10,149
How did that not fit? That was a bug. I like this one. Orange objects will disappear when touched.

875
04:15:10,149 --> 04:15:27,299
Make the balloon touch the left wall. Come on. IQ under pressure is probably a lot different than

876
04:15:27,299 --> 04:15:36,299
sitting quietly in a testing room by yourself. Yeah. Water balloon. Put every drop in the beaker.

877
04:15:36,299 --> 04:16:12,780
Ah, interesting. Interesting. Interesting. Nice. Where's my water level? That's an old one. That's

878
04:16:12,780 --> 04:16:25,139
a really old one. Do you know what's crazy about iPad games and mobile games now? I don't know if

879
04:16:25,139 --> 04:16:35,450
they were like this before. Holy shit. If you go to the, what the app is tracking and the privacy

880
04:16:35,450 --> 04:16:42,979
stuff that Apple has in the Apple store, it is unbelievable. What you need to know about me,

881
04:16:42,979 --> 04:16:52,420
for me to play your match three video game. It's fucked. I remember looking at one. It was like,

882
04:16:52,420 --> 04:17:00,700
oh, like, I don't want to say a wrong game, but one of them wanted, it was going to like email,

883
04:17:00,700 --> 04:17:09,340
like location, precise location, purchase ID, device ID. It was literally every single possible

884
04:17:09,340 --> 04:17:16,389
thing. Every single possible thing. It was just like, why do you need all this information? And

885
04:17:16,469 --> 04:17:19,989
sometimes you'll go to one, it'd be on the app store and you're like, all right, what do they

886
04:17:19,989 --> 04:17:25,350
want from me now? Let me guess. You want like my fucking credit card number and everything. You

887
04:17:25,350 --> 04:17:29,670
want to know like who I am and everything about me. And then you scroll down. It's like this app

888
04:17:29,670 --> 04:17:37,290
does not collect any information. Sometimes I just buy those. Sometimes I just buy them. I just buy

889
04:17:37,290 --> 04:17:50,420
them because like, yup, you're, I get you. And you're fucking, you thank you. Billionaire,

890
04:17:50,420 --> 04:17:58,469
millionaire rich. I mean, a lot of these are like $2 guys. And I play them. If I'm

891
04:17:58,469 --> 04:18:02,950
on the fence for a mobile game and mobile game developers, I'm talking to you directly.

892
04:18:02,950 --> 04:18:07,750
If I'm on the fence about a mobile game, if I'm looking at it like, hmm, all right, this is like,

893
04:18:07,750 --> 04:18:14,100
this is like two, three bucks. Okay. Well, this is like a game. I go right down there and I go,

894
04:18:14,100 --> 04:18:20,250
you taking anything? If the answer is no, I'm not on the fence anymore. I'm going to try it out.

895
04:18:20,250 --> 04:18:25,000
I'm going to check it out. I'm talking to you. What about that family guy game? I don't know.

896
04:18:25,000 --> 04:18:32,090
That was like, it was like eight years ago. I don't know. I have no idea. This feature

897
04:18:32,090 --> 04:18:47,059
wasn't available in like iOS two or whatever it was. And, and also sometimes you go to that,

898
04:18:47,059 --> 04:18:51,860
the privacy thing and it's like, oh yeah, it's collecting, you know, like device information.

899
04:18:51,860 --> 04:18:56,579
Okay. Like you, you know, bugs and stuff. All right. We need to know what kind of device this

900
04:18:56,579 --> 04:19:03,930
is to make sure I'm all right with that. I'm okay with device kind of information. That's fine.

901
04:19:03,930 --> 04:19:16,250
That is fine. But once it's like, Hey, um, what are your emails? I don't, what are you,

902
04:19:16,250 --> 04:19:36,090
what are you talking about? Oh, that was close. Oh, that's close. I like in behind the knee

903
04:19:36,090 --> 04:19:53,319
and then right there. And then a little bit of fulcrum action and let's go for it. I actually

904
04:19:53,319 --> 04:20:27,899
just hit my hands on my thing. Don't do it. You have a home alone IQ. What does that? I,

905
04:20:27,899 --> 04:20:32,120
what does that mean? I think I know what that means. That means that like in a scenario where

906
04:20:32,120 --> 04:20:36,280
I'm going to be dropping paint cans on strings to hitch people in the face. Is that what you mean?

907
04:20:36,280 --> 04:20:44,200
Like that's what I can do when it comes to deducing problems. Hey, Jerma, we have this

908
04:20:44,200 --> 04:20:48,600
complicated problem that we need to, uh, uh, for, you know, customer information and, uh,

909
04:20:48,600 --> 04:20:56,870
can you give us a hand here? Yeah. How about you put some paint cans on some string and then when

910
04:20:56,870 --> 04:21:03,909
they walk in, you let go of the paint can holding it in a pendulum fashion and it'll break their

911
04:21:03,909 --> 04:21:13,530
nose and shatter their fucking face. Well, this is a, this is a marketing call in which

912
04:21:13,530 --> 04:21:27,049
I was trying to figure out marketing stuff. Oh, just call me when you need me. The home alone

913
04:21:27,049 --> 04:21:32,629
movies are some of my favorite movies ever as one of the specific reasons why is because it lives

914
04:21:32,629 --> 04:21:41,379
in a cartoon world, but it's supposed to be like real life Chicago. If you took a paint can to the

915
04:21:41,379 --> 04:21:53,299
face, you might die. It might kill you. The, the second that one of those dudes falls down the

916
04:21:53,299 --> 04:22:18,059
stairs and there's like nails sticking out. They're dead. I do love, uh, the Joe Pesci psych.

917
04:22:22,379 --> 04:22:27,659
Nobody does that anymore. When was the last time you heard of razza frazza?

918
04:22:27,659 --> 04:22:34,569
They don't do it anymore. Oh, there's also the, yeah, this is one of my favorite parts of the

919
04:22:34,569 --> 04:22:45,610
movie. Marv literally throws a brick at this kid. Like he's trying to hit this kid with a brick

920
04:22:45,610 --> 04:22:57,370
and like he's trying to, it's, it's, it's unbelievably throws it as hard as he can.

921
04:22:57,370 --> 04:23:12,020
The brick is going very fast. I, that's one of my favorite scenes. That was quick. They're

922
04:23:12,020 --> 04:23:21,110
legitimately trying to kill him in that movie. They really are. How do, how do we do this?

923
04:23:23,260 --> 04:23:35,540
You need to touch the bottom one. Well, Oh, look at that. Hey, I know what we got to do.

924
04:23:35,540 --> 04:23:47,979
What are your thoughts on cheddar checks? I'm going to have to recommend you a far superior

925
04:23:47,979 --> 04:24:00,409
product. The far superior product is the cheese it mix. The cheese it mix is the best one of all.

926
04:24:00,409 --> 04:24:08,379
The cheese it mix is cheez-its, which are phenomenal. They're pretzels, which are phenomenal.

927
04:24:08,379 --> 04:24:16,540
It's the little breads, which are phenomenal. And it's the little white puffs, which are phenomenal.

928
04:24:16,540 --> 04:24:22,840
Ain't no bullshit in there that you want. There's nothing you're going to skip over there.

929
04:24:22,840 --> 04:24:31,100
It's only the best part of every single mixed, uh, snack mix up thing. And it's got a lot of

930
04:24:31,100 --> 04:24:37,739
little breads in there. You just know complaints when you take a handful because sometimes you

931
04:24:37,739 --> 04:24:44,010
don't, the checks ones are fine, but sometimes I get to the point where there's kind of too

932
04:24:44,010 --> 04:24:51,129
many checks left and I don't really want to eat checks anymore. That does not happen at all when

933
04:24:51,129 --> 04:26:14,940
eating the cheese it one. So that answers your question. What the fuck? Really? What is going

934
04:26:14,940 --> 04:26:59,610
on here? What is happening? Oh, I get it. I need to like swing it. How am I going to do that? I

935
04:26:59,610 --> 04:28:30,659
got to yank it. Wait, what if I do this? This might be kind of weird. Leave only one. That's easy.

936
04:28:45,049 --> 04:30:05,690
Make the ball touch all the red area. That ball? Shoot. I'm sorry. Yeah. Uh, I don't know. All I

937
04:30:05,690 --> 04:30:48,649
know how to do is make seesaws and fulcrums and hooks that don't work. Make a hammer and have a

938
04:30:48,649 --> 04:32:01,860
pivot around the center. Is it? Oh, I did it. Yes. New quest. Let me tell you something.

939
04:32:01,860 --> 04:32:10,360
Quasimodo. Quasimodo. No, you should not. Don't ever feel like you can't talk to me. Quasimodo.

940
04:32:10,360 --> 04:33:34,970
Keep your drawing in the red area. Three, two, three, two, one. Put all the blue balls in the

941
04:33:34,970 --> 04:34:10,740
beaker. I think I can handle that. I think I can handle it. Quasimodo. We get it. You watched that

942
04:34:10,740 --> 04:34:28,259
movie like a week ago. Yeah. So what? Can you please say stones the way that you do? I don't

943
04:34:28,259 --> 04:34:56,919
know. How many subs came in today? The stones. What the fuck did I think that was going to do?

944
04:34:56,919 --> 04:36:21,299
It kind of worked. Yay. The springs actually do that? Can I make these? Make all the yellow

945
04:36:21,299 --> 04:36:45,029
balls touch the red area. Ooh. Well, uh, how do I do this? It's time for a fulcrum. It might be.

946
04:36:45,029 --> 04:37:14,490
I think you're right. I don't know how to do this. Make the ball touch the ground.

947
04:37:14,490 --> 04:38:47,130
Just fill it with packing peanuts. Son of a gun. I think you're onto something. Yeah.

948
04:38:47,130 --> 04:39:22,810
Make the balloon touch the left wall. How is this going to get through? How the fuck is this going

949
04:39:22,810 --> 04:40:46,500
to get through? I mean, can the ball even fit through there? Put all the red balls in the box.

950
04:40:46,500 --> 04:41:37,450
It's an easy task. Just got to get a little bit of wedge action in here. Make the balloon touch

951
04:41:37,450 --> 04:42:00,819
the left wall. Wait, I have to pop that. How am I going to pop this? Oh, I know. Displacement.

952
04:42:00,819 --> 04:42:58,470
Fucking touch it already. Touch it. It was never going to work, was it? Maybe it will. Oh, wait a

953
04:42:58,470 --> 04:43:21,430
minute. Okay. I can do it with displacement. What are you? What? Touch that wall. Oh, I didn't think

954
04:43:21,430 --> 04:44:16,220
about what I was doing. It's all right. I'll get it with displacement. Shit. All right. Just touch

955
04:44:16,220 --> 04:44:55,500
the left wall. Hurry up. Touch the wall. This shit is fucking hard. It's just like, it makes me want

956
04:44:55,500 --> 04:45:02,869
to just get up and run a lap. I just want to get up and run a lap. I just need to move. You know,

957
04:45:02,869 --> 04:45:07,209
do you know what I mean? You know what I'm saying? You know what I mean, Vern? I said that like

958
04:45:07,209 --> 04:46:14,549
thousand times tonight. Got it. Got it. Put more than five blue balls in the beaker. Oh, displacement.

959
04:46:14,549 --> 04:47:13,139
How would you ever make this work? How would I scoop? Make a spoon? That's not how a spoon goes.

960
04:47:13,139 --> 04:48:04,250
I don't. I mean, how do I make it scoop? Like, how? How would I make it? All it does is fall down.

961
04:48:04,250 --> 04:48:41,880
How do I? How the hell do I make a wedge? Make it pointing down. I don't. I love his brain. Just

962
04:48:41,880 --> 04:48:46,279
make it straight like just like a knife just falling straight down the middle. But how am

963
04:48:46,279 --> 04:49:14,630
I going to scoop them into the thing? That doesn't help me at all. More than five, by the way. I don't

964
04:49:14,630 --> 04:49:33,639
think that's going to happen. Where is it? Remember how a shovel works? Yes. A shovel works by me

965
04:49:33,639 --> 04:49:42,009
digging down and then lifting up. All I can do is let go of the shovel in my hands and drop it on

966
04:49:42,009 --> 04:50:06,650
the ground. See what I'm saying? So here's your shovel. These are my fingers grabbing it, right?

967
04:50:06,650 --> 04:50:26,619
So I'm grabbing onto the shovel here, my arms, and this is we're not going to finish that drawing.

968
04:50:26,619 --> 04:50:33,779
Oh, that's one too. I think I can just do it. I'll just get it. Ready? We're just driving a nail

969
04:50:33,779 --> 04:51:34,650
into this. Put one of the balls on the ground. That's fun. What was this one? No, OK, I did a

970
04:51:34,650 --> 04:51:42,869
lot of these already. What about this one? Touch all the orange balls. The orange balls will explode

971
04:51:42,869 --> 04:52:35,110
when touched. Why would you do it any other way? Make the red bar touch the ground. This is going

972
04:52:35,110 --> 04:53:15,270
to be really hard. Oh, still possible. That right side. Get in there. It's right there.

973
04:53:19,770 --> 04:53:51,270
Yeah, that's annoying. It might wedge in. This is my like, how annoying can I be in one day stream?

974
04:53:51,270 --> 04:54:22,819
We're getting our limit. OK, I think I can just drop it from here. Just don't get rid of area.

975
04:54:22,819 --> 04:54:37,290
Why would I get rid of everything though? Make the red ball touch the red area. This is moving.

976
04:54:37,290 --> 04:54:52,840
It's not something weird. Like, hold on. I just want to see what happens. Oh, I can't even. Wait,

977
04:54:52,840 --> 04:55:14,119
what? Oh, I see. OK, you have to blow into your mic for this one. It's interactive. What was that

978
04:55:14,119 --> 04:55:30,540
on the DS? DS game. Um, I think I'm just going to make a big one. Does that work? Oh, keep going.

979
04:55:30,540 --> 04:56:16,380
There it is. Oh, no, it's not. Oh, keep going. Keep going. It's almost there. There it is. Yes.

980
04:56:16,380 --> 04:56:39,990
Oh, OK, this shouldn't be that bad. It's not that bad. And I've even made him do a front flip.

981
04:56:39,990 --> 04:57:11,860
Uh, what? Come on, do it. That should be good. Uh, no, just a little too much. I think I got to

982
04:57:11,860 --> 04:57:16,299
queue another one up. Yep. Just like that. Got to do one and then drop this one from a little bit

983
04:57:16,299 --> 04:57:47,560
higher. Uh, I can't draw in this circle. So for when yelling at me. I just had it too. One chat

984
04:57:47,560 --> 04:58:18,889
never got in my head. I just beat it. Why did I let it go? Really stopped it perfectly in his foot.

985
04:58:18,889 --> 04:58:52,009
All right, don't move. Very nice. Very nice. Make the red areas touch each other. My goodness. This

986
04:58:52,009 --> 04:59:27,419
kind of hurts my head. Make all the red squares fly out of the screen. Drop some big balls on it.

987
04:59:27,419 --> 04:59:49,930
I think that's probably correct. What else we got? Did this one? Did that one? Make the rabbit touch

988
04:59:49,930 --> 05:00:18,790
the flag. It's slippery. That'll be enough. Is it too much? Just a little. How gentle do I have to

989
05:00:18,790 --> 05:01:02,569
be? OK, it'll get there. Let's give it a second. Move the red thing into the screen. Move the

990
05:01:02,569 --> 05:02:15,139
red thing into the screen. Wait, I got an idea. Well, that was bad, but whatever. It was bad. OK,

991
05:02:15,139 --> 05:03:13,830
I'll get it right. All right. Inched out a little. Come on. Yep. Oh, I blocked it. Pull it? Like,

992
05:03:13,830 --> 05:04:08,759
I don't know. What am I supposed to pinch it out? Does that help? Way too far. You know what I'm

993
05:04:08,759 --> 05:04:50,520
doing. Let's fucking go. Oh, almost worked. Almost worked. You know what I'm doing. Going for it again.

994
05:04:56,310 --> 05:05:07,900
Would you guys allow me one more Quasimodo? Can I do one more? Can we do a poll, please? Can I say

995
05:05:07,900 --> 05:05:58,840
Quasimodo as that character one more time? Let's do a poll. It's going to work. It's your stream,

996
05:05:58,840 --> 05:06:53,020
man. Quasimodo. I don't know. I can't grip it, though. That's not a bad idea. Wait a minute.

997
05:06:53,020 --> 05:07:23,340
We'll use displacement. Yes, 83% said I could do it again. Yeah, I'm not very good at this.

998
05:07:23,340 --> 05:07:33,060
It's OK, though. I'm just having fun. You mean like this part here? That's actually, if that's

999
05:07:33,060 --> 05:08:04,700
what you mean, then that's definitely a great idea. Can I weigh in the end down? Can I weigh it down?

1000
05:08:04,700 --> 05:08:40,650
I think it's too heavy. Grab top and slide to lock it in. I don't know. I don't know how you

1001
05:08:40,650 --> 05:09:02,709
do a pulling action. I don't know. Someone's smart to figure it out. Pour it out. Oh, I did it.

1002
05:09:02,709 --> 05:10:00,150
I did it. I did it. I kind of did it. I did it. Did I do it? Did I do it? Didn't do it. I had a

1003
05:10:00,150 --> 05:10:39,830
lot of momentum on it. Just rip it down. No. All right, now get out of the way. That was perfect.

1004
05:10:39,830 --> 05:11:20,439
Oh, more. That has to be it. I don't think so. It went back in. Yeah, I wish we'd just stop moving.

1005
05:11:20,439 --> 05:11:30,439
It's hard to actually hook onto it. All right, now it's coming out, but now it's going back.

1006
05:11:30,439 --> 05:11:38,090
No, there it is. God damn it. Does this have to be longer maybe? I don't know how much longer

1007
05:11:38,090 --> 05:11:47,139
I'd want to make it till I pull it there, like pull it back. Oh, yes. All right, now keep going,

1008
05:11:47,139 --> 05:12:05,979
please. Come on, do it. No, it got to the end and screwed up. Oh, don't do this to me right now,

1009
05:12:05,979 --> 05:12:42,020
please. Oh, my God. What is even happening right now? Wouldn't it have to go out this way?

1010
05:12:42,020 --> 05:13:12,099
You have to get it to go on its own. I think that will weigh it down enough and then fall off and

1011
05:13:12,099 --> 05:13:35,000
then fall off and then fall off. All right, it fell off. Fall off. All right, now do it naturally.

1012
05:13:35,000 --> 05:13:42,630
There it is. Get it out. Should be perfect now. It's look at it. And then look, it bugged out again.

1013
05:13:42,630 --> 05:13:48,540
No, I think it's good. Good. Almost. No shit. What the hell's going on here?

1014
05:13:48,540 --> 05:14:36,139
Fuck. It's too wide. I don't want to make it this wide. Can I pull it down? Spin it. A physics

1015
05:14:36,139 --> 05:14:46,680
puzzle where the physics fall out of the hole. All right, so the thing's going and then it just

1016
05:14:46,680 --> 05:15:18,860
like detaches. Like, why does it pull out and start going in a random direction? What just happened?

1017
05:15:18,860 --> 05:15:37,990
Like, I'm not even allowed to do what I just did and I just did it. All right, start. All right,

1018
05:15:37,990 --> 05:16:05,500
it's going to have momentum. Right, go. All right, now can I stop it? It's still kind of going.

1019
05:16:05,659 --> 05:16:39,369
See, it's all fucked up again. What's happening here? What is going on? Shouldn't it be going like

1020
05:16:39,369 --> 05:16:46,040
this still? Like, how would it be stuck here? Like, falling out of the back? Why does it

1021
05:16:46,040 --> 05:17:29,340
keep doing that? So what's the play here? I don't get it. Hook it again. I'm blocking it now. It

1022
05:17:29,340 --> 05:18:00,229
doesn't weigh enough to keep going. Can I just try to, I don't know, just pull it off. Push it

1023
05:18:00,229 --> 05:18:07,500
out with balls. I don't want to get any stuck in here. I feel like it's so close. I just want to

1024
05:18:07,500 --> 05:18:17,060
drag it off. I guess I could go like this. Can I like just pull it down from here? There it is.

1025
05:18:17,060 --> 05:18:20,659
And that should be, ah, all right. We're getting there. We're getting somewhere. We're getting

1026
05:18:20,659 --> 05:18:46,950
somewhere. I'm afraid to hook it, but I'm gonna. All right, we're, oh, is it in the perfect spot

1027
05:18:46,950 --> 05:19:00,619
to just fucking ruin everything? Come on, dude. Really? No, it's not. You hooked it too deep.

1028
05:19:00,619 --> 05:19:09,020
I think I can still do it though. Hold on. I think I can do it if I go like this and just have it

1029
05:19:09,020 --> 05:19:43,860
drag it a little. I'm going to grab the whole thing and like spin it. Do it. No, it's happening.

1030
05:19:43,860 --> 05:19:52,360
Pull it down. Pull it down. You can do it. I, it's not over. It's not over yet. This just needs to

1031
05:19:52,360 --> 05:19:56,900
a little bit more weight has to be up here. I'm going to wait till it gets to here and then let

1032
05:19:56,900 --> 05:20:15,060
it go. I'm going the other way. Okay. All right. There's a little bit of progress. At least I moved

1033
05:20:15,060 --> 05:20:50,330
it. Drag it down with my last try and I'm done. Okay. That was a good pull. Very good. That was

1034
05:20:50,330 --> 05:21:02,919
a great start. Okay. And now what do I do? Good start. Phenomenal start. I'm just going to pull

1035
05:21:02,919 --> 05:21:29,400
it down like this. I'm not putting anything in there yet. I'm so afraid to hook this wrong.

1036
05:21:29,400 --> 05:21:45,819
Do an L. You mean, okay. So you mean like this, like that, like that hook with L do a seven hook

1037
05:21:45,819 --> 05:22:06,229
hook an L and L will fall. Yeah. No, no, no. Go all the way, please. Okay. It's almost there.

1038
05:22:06,950 --> 05:22:50,740
I'm so scared to fuck this up. Oh, it's so close. That's it right there. I went. Yep. There it is.

1039
05:22:50,740 --> 05:23:06,540
Thank God. Roll the thing out to the left side. Roll the thing out to the left side. I don't get

1040
05:23:06,540 --> 05:23:56,150
it. I'm so glad that that went completely off screen. I don't even know what it was. I got it.

1041
05:23:56,150 --> 05:24:45,799
Okay. So I just got to pull it now. How can I pull it from here? I have an idea. See if it works.

1042
05:24:45,880 --> 05:26:00,889
You got to pull it off screen. Come on. Crunch it. Oh, yanked. Uh oh. What was wrong with that?

1043
05:26:00,889 --> 05:26:12,630
How did I not yank it? Let's pull it all the way to the left. All right. This is the last one.

1044
05:26:12,630 --> 05:26:17,799
And I'm going to call it for tonight. This game is fun though. If you're, if you have a brain

1045
05:26:17,799 --> 05:26:24,740
and it works and you have it, I would say at least like, you know, like a seventh grade education,

1046
05:26:24,740 --> 05:26:46,200
you'd probably have a good time playing it. I wonder should it be bigger here in the middle?

1047
05:26:46,200 --> 05:27:12,500
Oh, I'll do. I'll try the hell levels. That's a good idea. It didn't even grip. I wish there

1048
05:27:12,500 --> 05:27:37,819
was a fill tool. I would use it right now. Oh, I got it. I got it. Um, pull it down. How far?

1049
05:27:37,819 --> 05:28:28,299
Wow. How big is this thing? I yanked it. It's a, it's a, I won. Keep going. We'll get it already.

1050
05:28:28,299 --> 05:29:06,520
I wonder if it's stuck more at the top. I just dragged it more ramp. I don't think I can get it.

1051
05:29:06,520 --> 05:29:48,860
Inch it in the middle. I don't think I can. All right. I'm done. Wait, look at how many levels

1052
05:29:48,860 --> 05:29:56,229
there are. This is ridiculous. Let the red ball touch the ground. Okay. I can't make anything up

1053
05:29:56,229 --> 05:30:39,590
there. Can't make anything down here. I have an idea. I'm curious. It's too bouncy. Jeremy,

1054
05:30:39,590 --> 05:31:28,970
you're crazy, dude. Uh, I'm all right. Okay. All right. So I effectively made a exit to have a new

1055
05:31:28,970 --> 05:32:55,080
idea. Okay. It doesn't weigh enough. I apologize. I looked up the IQ 130 speed run record and it's

1056
05:32:55,080 --> 05:33:03,349
all hooks with balls attached to them. I should have not slandered you. Thank you. I really

1057
05:33:03,349 --> 05:33:32,169
appreciate it. Okay. This one's crazy. Keep 10 or more drawing objects on the screen. Uh, what?

1058
05:33:32,169 --> 05:33:46,330
10 or more objects? I guess like the only way to do this is to click a million times. All right.

1059
05:33:46,330 --> 05:34:05,909
God. You have to move the, I can't do it in the same spot. It's, it's too hard because you have

1060
05:34:05,909 --> 05:34:34,340
to move the mouse too. That's fucking impossible. Hold on. Let me get in the right mindset here.

1061
05:34:34,340 --> 05:35:17,130
I'm just gonna, I'm gonna take the music out. I'm just gonna go. I'm in like a shitty position

1062
05:35:17,130 --> 05:35:58,650
here. I need to like be, I need to get leverage on them on the ground. I almost had it. It's just,

1063
05:35:58,650 --> 05:36:46,659
it's the, it's having to drag the mouse too. It's like fucking impossible. Hold on. Oh,

1064
05:36:56,409 --> 05:37:24,580
let's go. I get it. How many is that? This is actually really fucking hard. One, two, three,

1065
05:37:24,580 --> 05:38:00,419
four, five, six, seven, eight. Okay. This is good. This is a good way to do it. This is,

1066
05:38:00,419 --> 05:38:21,430
how many is that? One, two, three, four, five, six. No, hold on. I gotta get like five or six

1067
05:38:21,430 --> 05:39:09,270
out. Shit. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Hey, fucking hand hurts.

1068
05:39:44,220 --> 05:40:07,659
Why did I do it the other way? My whole body hurts now. Okay. That's one, two, three, four,

1069
05:40:07,659 --> 05:40:40,619
five, six, seven, eight, nine. Aye. Game is like crashing. Look at us. Something's wrong. Hold on.

1070
05:40:40,619 --> 05:41:06,360
Oh shit. I can't. It hurts. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

1071
05:41:07,500 --> 05:42:23,270
10. Aye. Go left and right instead of, that's a good idea. Nine every time. Fuck you. Damn it.

1072
05:42:23,990 --> 05:43:00,470
I can't. It's so hard. It just like hurts to do. Where's the actual game area? Okay. Like look at

1073
05:43:00,470 --> 05:43:31,990
this. Not even the right area. I can't click up here. Stupid. Two, three, four, five, six. That's

1074
05:43:31,990 --> 05:43:38,599
10 objects on the screen. Where's the, what are you talking about? One, two, three, four, five,

1075
05:43:38,599 --> 05:44:13,020
six, seven, eight, nine. This is 10, right? No, it's not. You gotta be fucking kidding me. No,

1076
05:44:13,020 --> 05:44:19,659
the lag just ruined everything. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. You gotta be

1077
05:44:19,659 --> 05:45:04,150
fucking kidding me, dude. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. I got five here.

1078
05:45:04,150 --> 05:45:30,439
Six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Holy shit. This is a good one. Look at this idea. Watch this idea.

1079
05:45:30,439 --> 05:46:10,740
Watch this shit. Ready? This is the one right here. Guaranteed. It's coming. You know it is.

1080
05:46:10,740 --> 05:47:21,770
That's it right here. What? It's a finicky fucking game. Okay. It's finicky. I'm gonna fucking eat

1081
05:47:21,770 --> 05:47:54,709
my hand in a second. Oh my God. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. I'm going to

1082
05:47:54,709 --> 05:48:25,610
bite my fingernails. I did it. All right. I'll see you guys later. That was fun. That was crazy.

1083
05:48:25,610 --> 05:48:34,900
All right, guys. See you soon. I will see you guys in a couple days. Friday. We'll do Friday.

1084
05:48:34,900 --> 05:48:51,080
Maybe Friday, Saturday. Friday, Saturday. Friday, Sunday. Thanks for hanging out. The game, by the

1085
05:48:51,080 --> 05:48:57,849
way, is called Cue Remastered, if you're wondering. Play this again sometime. I think I've gotten out

1086
05:48:57,849 --> 05:49:03,959
of all the beginner and intermediate levels to a point where you actually have to really, really

1087
05:49:03,959 --> 05:49:13,209
be very intricate. You can't just draw hooks and seesaws anymore, but it's fun. It's a cool game.

1088
05:49:13,209 --> 05:49:34,840
I like it a lot. It's a good idea. I had fun with it. Multiplayer would be cool with this. It would be.

1089
05:49:34,840 --> 05:49:40,409
Yeah. I'll see you guys Friday at four o'clock. Pacific. That's the next time I plan on streaming.

1090
05:49:40,409 --> 05:49:53,419
Keep an eye on the sus. Thanks for watching. Anything else I wanted to talk about today?

1091
05:49:53,419 --> 05:50:10,330
I don't think so. Are you going to show the video that you're working on when it's done?

1092
05:50:10,330 --> 05:50:20,810
Yeah. I'm working on a video. You'll see it. It's not a big deal. It really isn't. It's just a

1093
05:50:20,889 --> 05:50:28,619
stupid... This video is probably going to be like seven minutes long. It's like a six to eight minute

1094
05:50:28,619 --> 05:50:38,939
video, but I need to make sure I'm in the right mindset because it's going to be... It's one of

1095
05:50:38,939 --> 05:50:51,930
my favorite videos. Is it going to go on the main channel, German985? It'd be kind of funny if this

1096
05:50:51,930 --> 05:50:58,810
was the video that I uploaded and you'll see why when you see it. Because if you don't know that

1097
05:50:58,810 --> 05:51:03,299
I moved over to Twitch pretty much permanently, if you don't know that and you just thought I

1098
05:51:03,299 --> 05:51:15,189
disappeared, you're going to think I sold the channel because this video would just... I mean,

1099
05:51:15,189 --> 05:51:20,169
it's going to be me in it. I'm going to be talking, but you're going to think that I sold the channel.

1100
05:51:20,169 --> 05:51:34,569
Like, there's going to be no way. It's going to be so jarring for so many people. I can't... Actually,

1101
05:51:34,569 --> 05:51:50,950
maybe I will just do it. It'll be funny. Yeah. Yeah. You'll see it. You'll see it. It's coming

1102
05:51:50,950 --> 05:51:56,220
out in about two weeks. Maybe earlier. It depends if I really just want to go for it.

1103
05:51:57,750 --> 05:52:03,830
All right. Good night. Goodbye. See you soon. Thanks for watching. Thanks for hanging out,

1104
05:52:03,830 --> 05:52:11,220
obviously. Have a great night. Call your mother. See you soon. See you Friday. Four o'clock Pacific.

1105
05:52:11,220 --> 05:52:32,819
Have a great night, everybody. See you soon. Okay. Hold on. Somebody said,

1106
05:52:32,819 --> 05:52:39,930
can you please confirm that it's not another Spider-Man update video? No, it is not. This is a

1107
05:52:39,930 --> 05:52:49,849
video. This is a real video. It's not a Spider-Man update video. Good guess, though, because that

1108
05:52:49,849 --> 05:53:34,090
would have been a really good guess. All right. See you later. Somebody said,

1109
05:53:34,090 --> 05:53:42,470
Jeremy, I know you're still here reading chat. Yeah. Yeah, I am. Usually do until the video turns

1110
05:53:42,470 --> 05:54:21,979
off. I see the shit, you guys, right? I'm watching. All right. Goodbye. Hey, it's me again. I'm really

1111
05:54:21,979 --> 05:54:29,290
trying to get this to end at five, five, five, five, five. Five hours, 55 minutes, 55 seconds.

1112
05:54:29,290 --> 05:54:39,909
See if I can get it. You guys remember that? I would... All right. I have 10 seconds to say this.

1113
05:54:39,909 --> 05:54:45,270
Do you guys remember, like, seven years ago, I used to end a bunch of my streams with me

1114
05:54:45,270 --> 05:54:52,970
just screaming and then hitting end stream? That was like a joke for a while. All right.
