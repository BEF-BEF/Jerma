00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:23,140
Hello. Good afternoon. How are you? Fresh water. Keep me going. We're going to continue playing

2
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:29,739
The Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction. Don't know what The Incredible Hulk is or what ultimate

3
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:38,259
destruction means. Um, you're in for a big treat today. And let me tell you, there are like 300

4
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:45,820
other Marvel characters. If you think The Hulk is cool, just wait till you see fucking radiation,

5
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:55,240
man. I'm sure he exists in Marvel. Let's find out. Okay. Uh, radiation, man. Marvel. They have a

6
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:05,939
database with like fucking 5,000 superheroes. Yes. Radioactive man, I guess. Radioactive man.

7
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:21,209
He's there. Marvel is the Simpsons of superheroes. Wait, am I following that correctly? It's wait,

8
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:24,890
jokes to the Simpsons are like Marvel to superheroes is what you're saying.

9
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:40,390
Okay. I get, I get you now. I get you. Wrong order. Jokes on the Simpsons are to like

10
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:46,170
superheroes that exist in Marvel. Howard the Duck is the best character. I mean, if it was a frog,

11
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:52,060
I'd probably agree with you. Why is there no frog Marvel superhero? Is there? Is there like a,

12
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:59,450
is there a frog man? Let's see. Frog Marvel. Is there a frog in Marvel? Yep. There is. His name

13
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:08,889
is leapfrog leapfrog. Cool. I have, why do I not own every single comic of this?

14
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:21,979
That's unfortunate. Here's to a good stream. Yeah. We're going to play some more Hulk.

15
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:28,139
I feel like I'm going to beat the game. I think there's only like another four plus five hours

16
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:32,939
or so left in the game and I'm going to, I'm going to beat it. If I don't beat it. Well,

17
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:38,780
then I'm in deep shit because if I can't be Hulk, if I cannot beat Hulk ultimate destruction,

18
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:48,039
but I will beat Simpsons hit and run. It's a problem there. Anyways, let's go. Uh,

19
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:57,560
we're just going to pick up where we left off yesterday. Is exactly right here. I just remember

20
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:06,680
the controls. A is jump. Good. You have to eat a Funko pop if you can't beat the game.

21
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:20,439
I don't want to eat a Funko pop. All right, let's get going. Show us your room so we can make fun

22
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:30,150
of you. No, I learned my lesson as of yesterday. Okay. Lesson has been learned. I ain't ever shown

23
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:51,210
myself on camera ever again. Good. We're sorry. Okay. Somebody just hit me in the air, right?

24
00:03:51,210 --> 00:04:03,590
That's not even possible. That's not even possible to hit me in the air. The threat has dropped.

25
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:08,699
What that means is I can't see him anymore. Therefore he doesn't exist.

26
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:13,460
Well, you know, when are they going to innovate on that? By the way,

27
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:24,069
I want some real AI innovation. GTA six. Check this out. Holy fucking holy shit. I just figured

28
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:30,100
out the greatest system ever. You guys know the nemesis system that everyone loved and was obsessed

29
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:41,290
with in a shadow of mortar. Imagine in GTA six, there's like detectives that like, like will track

30
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,970
you down and like they'll do their little intro. They'll come in and like detective car and they'll

31
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:51,589
be like asking you questions. That would be incredible. It wouldn't happen that frequently.

32
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:59,879
That would be awesome to have like a nemesis system, but it's detectives in GTA six.

33
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:13,220
Can I just break the bridge? Can I break the bridge? Where's the star on top? Is it on top of

34
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:19,220
the bridge? Nintendo should hire you. Well, Nintendo doesn't, it hasn't been a Nintendo

35
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,439
grant of photos since ever. Has it ever been? Okay. I can make this jump. I promise.

36
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:51,180
Just break it so I can get it. The camera. Sorry. Oh, nobody was in there. Okay.

37
00:05:51,180 --> 00:06:01,980
Hey, hey, let me, excuse me. Was that a missile? Don't worry. There's always a guy with a missile

38
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:25,829
launcher. Where is he? Find a monk. Come here. I want you to watch me do this. You're going to

39
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:33,100
watch me complete this. It's Chad. No, no, put me down. You're going to sit here. You're going to

40
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:39,180
watch me get to the star. No, please. No, you're so bad. You can't do it. Please don't hurt me.

41
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:48,569
I'm not going to hurt you. I'm not going to hurt you. The sharks might.

42
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:56,089
Turns out he hit the edge of the bridge. Sorry. Wait, what are you guys doing?

43
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:06,379
Why? What are you people doing? Why are you jumping off the bridge? Hey, why are they?

44
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:32,199
I'm not doing this. Am I? I have nothing to do with this. I can't. Well, cut it out. Okay.

45
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:37,000
Let's do it. Our stolen mainframe interfaces directly into the division satellite tracking

46
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,040
system. Viewers dropping. Oh my God. Get the fuck out of here. Secured research facilities.

47
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,680
Get out of here. Profilers are as delicate as they are there. So you're going to have to bring

48
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,040
the whole truck back. Oh, that's secured by a mechanized escort team and some sort of energy

49
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,600
defense field. If I had more time, I could get some data on this, but you intercept the truck

50
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:05,879
and bring it back. That sounds easy enough. But anyways, detective and they'd be named

51
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,040
and each person in a different game could have their own detective. That was like coming after

52
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:15,319
them. Maybe you could even be a detective. No, that would never work. Maybe you could be a detective

53
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:21,079
in somebody else's game, but no, the first person that was able to invade your game like Dark Soul

54
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:25,660
style and be a detective would just fucking fly a helicopter to where you were and just launch

55
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,699
missiles at you while you ran around in a circle until you died. And then they would leave your

56
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:33,019
game. This would never work. And on paper, it's a great idea. In practice, it's horrible.

57
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:48,659
Intercept. I have to take the whole truck. Jeremy, you're cool. Hope you're doing well.

58
00:08:48,659 --> 00:09:22,899
Hey, thanks. Did I make it? I did. Forward. Dash. I think I made okay time here. That was

59
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:37,700
a nice sponsored one guy. How do you sponsor one guy? I don't understand. But did you mean I'm

60
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,539
paying people to write nice things about me? Is that what you're saying? All right. I'm going to

61
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:51,190
take it slow. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Give me this shit. Shield. Okay.

62
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:58,899
Where's this helicopter? Oh, damn it. Oh shit. Oh, it looks like three detectives got in my game.

63
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:09,379
No. Okay. Yeah. Where's the nice investigation you got going here? Oh, there he is.

64
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,220
Oh, the three of you in a discord together. I think it's funny to like come in my game and do

65
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:23,980
this. How do I turn off online mode? Because that's what's going to happen. Anybody know?

66
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:29,100
I can't wait to read like the 50 fucking steam discussion threads about how to turn off online

67
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:45,860
mode. Thanks a lot, guys. I just got absolutely destroyed. That was insane. Okay. So lesson

68
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:55,529
learned. Got to destroy the helicopters first. If only you had a move that blocked missiles.

69
00:10:55,529 --> 00:11:12,309
I know it's called play in offline mode. It's going to run down the road. Nice Funko pop loser.

70
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:18,710
Where were you yesterday? Are you watching the VOD and you think it's a live chat?

71
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:27,620
Wait, that doesn't make any sense. How would that be possible? All right. I'm going for it.

72
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,539
Here we go. There they are. All right. All right. All right. All right. Give me cars.

73
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:52,950
Where are they? They're up there. Get out of the fucking way. We go in three, two, three,

74
00:11:53,590 --> 00:12:19,419
two, one. Launch homing car. Got it. Oh my God. Get over. It's still, that can't be still alive.

75
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:44,039
Right. Oh, fuck you. Health, right? No, I have to kill these things. Otherwise I'm in deep trouble.

76
00:12:53,340 --> 00:13:15,480
Hi. Kick it. Backhand. Kick. Headbutt. Buy coffee. What? Did somebody just say buy coffee?

77
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:24,820
He's still talking about Funko pop. Am I ever going to get you guys to stop talking about Funko

78
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:31,929
pops? Am I going to, am I going to have to eat like, oh no, am I going to have to eat like a

79
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:38,299
live squid on stream for you guys to like, be like, holy shit. This is, I got to, this is boy. Okay.

80
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:55,659
Fuck the Funko pops ever. This dude's eating squid. Do I have to eat a cooked squid calamari

81
00:13:55,659 --> 00:14:04,580
on stream for you guys to stop this? Here we go. All right. Yeah. I intercept it. Don't kill it.

82
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:09,830
I have to grab this and run away with it. But this tank over there has his items.

83
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:41,990
Great. Hank. Almost there. Oh fuck. It's almost there. It's almost there. Oh, I did too many

84
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:48,789
jumps. I did too many jumps. Don't let it die. Come here. Get it. He's on two wheels. He's showing

85
00:14:48,789 --> 00:15:00,389
up. Wait, why is he electrified? What? I got to break it. Throw something at it. Who the fuck are

86
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:31,700
you? Okay. Get it. Is it electrified still? Wait, what the fuck? Locate division transport.

87
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:47,740
Retrieve division transport. Okay. I located it and I tried to retrieve it. What do you mean?

88
00:15:47,740 --> 00:16:00,710
Read. Locate transport. Retrieve transport. It's, there it is. What else do I have to do besides

89
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:37,820
play city heroes? They don't even exist anymore. Why do I feel like I'm at like times five speed?

90
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:56,570
Help. No, don't throw the tank. What is? Okay. Like seriously. Honest to God.

91
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:07,700
Did you give me a break? Why are these tuned like this? And now I see. Yes, I just said tuned.

92
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:24,680
Okay. Why is this tuned like this? Fucking God. I'm about to die because the helicopters

93
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:31,880
fly around at 1200 miles per hour and they drive into the fucking ground and into buildings and

94
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:42,150
doesn't even matter. They just slam and skid all over everything. I was fucking tuned like that.

95
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:15,859
He's got a bus. Why do I have the bus in my hand? I mean, if you were in this bus, which okay,

96
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:20,740
if you could get across the whole city in fucking like two minutes instead of like 40.

97
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:27,460
Okay. Mission objective. Disable division transport vehicle by throwing things at it.

98
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:40,440
What am I doing that? I was throwing shit at it already. How many things? How many things

99
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:54,200
do I have to throw at it? Do I have to keep doing this until it's broken? Oh, I don't. Do I?

100
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:04,279
They're destroying the thing. I can't even, man. This is fucking ridiculous. This is made by the

101
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:32,980
Simpsons hit and run devs. No chance that it's not. No chance. It has to have been. Get. No,

102
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,779
don't jump in the water. How do I avoid the water? How do I avoid the water?

103
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:53,059
Mike, how far am I? Where's the nearest one? What? Fuck. I have to go around the whole thing.

104
00:19:55,049 --> 00:20:07,940
That's not cool. Here comes a fall joke. No, I don't want to do this one again.

105
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:15,740
Can anyone count how many times? Okay. How many missions have I done so far?

106
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:21,690
I think I've done what? Like 10 missions. I think at every single mission at the end,

107
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:26,410
I've said, no, no, I don't want to do this one again. I ran by it. I ran by it. Fuck.

108
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:33,049
I'm literally not even paying attention to the game. I'm just speaking to you guys.

109
00:20:44,170 --> 00:21:00,019
Jump out. But what I was saying was I don't think I've ended a mission and gone. Yes. Oh,

110
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:16,200
I wish I could do that one again. Shield grind. I'm going to get the shield grind.

111
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:34,180
I have 100,000 Hulk points. I was going to say green points. All right. Shield grind. Grind any

112
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:39,369
shield just like a board. I don't want. How's this going to even help me? What?

113
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:57,269
How's this going to help me? A club smasher, air sonic, missile punchback, reflect projectiles

114
00:21:57,269 --> 00:22:14,279
with a well-timed punchback. I want to try this move out. Remember the shield grind is a full

115
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:27,589
letter grade. Oh, is that a car? That's actually all right. Cool. Try following the on-screen

116
00:22:27,589 --> 00:22:32,630
instructions. We need to get a handle on these new powers. There are 30 missions. I'll see you

117
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:49,319
guys next week. I've already done like 15 of them. If you can target, see what if I just punch

118
00:22:49,319 --> 00:23:05,849
wildly? Will it work? That is confirmed. I have it. You still get, okay, if they, if they fire

119
00:23:05,849 --> 00:23:20,779
10 of them at you, you're going to get hit by nine. Well done. But also they die. That's true.

120
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:30,950
All right. Let's go. Oh, that is actually the same depth. I, yeah, I can tell.

121
00:23:31,829 --> 00:23:58,740
Why do they call him the Hulk? It's the, what do you mean? You talk, well, you're talking about

122
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:08,869
like, why do, why do they call him the Hulk? Cause he's a big person, like huge hulking,

123
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:22,339
jacked, large, lots of mass. What do you, I don't know. I got to buy more shit.

124
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:37,529
Yeah. That's a mass. This is what it means. A critical thunder clap. No, no, no. It's too

125
00:24:37,529 --> 00:24:48,730
expensive. I want like air critical atomic, air enemy grapple. Yes. Those guys are so spear impale

126
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:58,549
max charge a club throw and spear Hulk class opponents. Yeah. I don't feel like that sentence

127
00:24:58,549 --> 00:25:06,630
I can't even comprehend this sentence. Max charge a club throw and spear Hulk class opponents

128
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:28,490
comprehending it. Max charge a club throw and spear Hulk class opponents. Yep. Running. Uh,

129
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:41,779
definitely bowling. Yes. Give me this. Create a spherical bowling ball. Nice. But I want bowling

130
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:54,839
cyclone skyjack ride any aircraft to its death or pummel it. Yes. Thank God.

131
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:06,619
Dashing ground slam dash into a classic ground smash, clearing a crowd of enemies from Hulk's

132
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:18,220
path. Yes. What else we got? Gamma quake. Use Hulk's, use Hulk size foes for an area of effect

133
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:31,619
attack. David, it's a superhero prototype also made by the Simpsons hit and run devs.

134
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:45,109
This is literally an RKO. Why did you read that? Like a restaurant commercial? I did.

135
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:53,509
I don't know. Cause it was like classic. Oh, turn this into a classic. They usually say that before

136
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:57,910
they say like their classic pasta or their classic breadsticks or their classic Italian

137
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:02,150
cuisine or pair it with a classic red wine. I don't know. That's what they say. Classic. Hey,

138
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:12,950
you posted cringe, bro. Thanks for the five community subs. Thanks a lot. We need a bunch

139
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:19,670
of uranium 235 from the nuclear power plant. Chances are Blonsky knows we're coming. Thankfully,

140
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:26,950
you know your way around fissionable material. Locate two fuel. All right. Get retrieve fuel

141
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:34,579
rods. That's all I have to do is get fuel rods. There's nothing else on the list of things.

142
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:59,450
It's just get rods. Found them. Those look really unstable. A couple of fuel rods. I want you to

143
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:03,450
know. I mean, nothing against you personally. And this should happen in the circumstances.

144
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:10,410
Homer working like this place. I'm sorry. Banner. I don't have a choice. Neither of us do.

145
00:28:11,849 --> 00:28:23,269
Who is this? I'm different than all your other. I just, I got one hit.

146
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:27,029
Is there like a, how to not get hurt?

147
00:28:55,539 --> 00:28:59,299
Get all of the guys. Okay. Let me figure out a fight. You know,

148
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:02,579
the boss fight, but then that just did a boss fight. I'm going to.

149
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:41,259
Worst gets going. Throw shit at her. Did you actually just say wrong? Where? All right,

150
00:29:41,259 --> 00:30:14,759
we're good. Jump rope. No wrong move. All right. You can't do charge attacks on her. You got to be

151
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:58,259
quick. Call me a baby. What'd you say? First try. I think so too.

152
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:33,299
You're annoying. Stop doing that. Why? All right. That's it. You came to me this time.

153
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:43,500
You're the idiot.

154
00:31:50,539 --> 00:32:21,930
What kind of jail is this? It's an interesting prison. No, no, no. I just tried to butt drop her.

155
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:37,690
Oh my goodness. All right. Help me. Critical mass is where I have to shine.

156
00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:43,640
Oh yeah. Well, I learned this. I don't have it anymore. Nevermind.

157
00:32:43,640 --> 00:33:00,599
I didn't learn it apparently. Turns out I don't know shit lady. Come on. Get over here.

158
00:33:10,009 --> 00:33:26,039
Give me this thing. It didn't hit her. What? What's happening? I don't know. Stop.

159
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:38,259
Don't. Oh, come on. How did it just come to me?

160
00:33:51,420 --> 00:34:06,089
You like it? Come here. All right. Now we act like a coward. Wait a minute. No, go in.

161
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:29,110
Don't go. Go on. Be a coward again.

162
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:56,969
Run. Nice. Can I hang on the walls? Can I just jump on the ceiling?

163
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:29,340
There's just so many. What the? Oh, I'm so mad by that one. Kick her. Kick her in the face.

164
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:32,650
This. Okay.

165
00:35:51,780 --> 00:36:18,250
Do you see the placement on those beams? Get the fuck. No. But they're eventually going to get me.

166
00:36:18,250 --> 00:37:01,929
See? No, don't jump at her. Okay. This one's not that powerful. Step on her head. Fuck you. Yeah.

167
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:20,710
Listen to me, banner. You don't understand. I had no choice.

168
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:27,619
It's Blonsky. He puts some kind of tracking device in my head. Never safe.

169
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:34,920
Don't you think you should have written that on a piece of paper and held it up beforehand?

170
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:41,800
You know what I mean? We could have saved ourselves an entire epic boss fight if you just held up a

171
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:51,579
fucking note that said all this. I do. It's got a tracking thing in your head. Just text it to me.

172
00:37:52,539 --> 00:38:16,090
He can't read. He can. All right. Leave him a voicemail. This is before phones, but he can't.

173
00:38:16,889 --> 00:38:30,739
Hulk has a phone? Yeah. Floor kick. Deliver instant disrespect with the floor kick.

174
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:37,989
I don't care how much it is. I'm getting it. Increase the power of critical mass. Yeah.

175
00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:53,260
Elbow drop. What? There's so many moves. There are too many moves. That's all I can do.

176
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:09,190
Hey, Willakilla, thanks for the five subs. Five community subs. Appreciate it. Just dropping

177
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:28,489
those. Sick. Now grind around town. Don't worry, I will. Blansky's. It's all Blansky. Blonsky.

178
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,480
Thousands of people just left. Fucking Bugleberry decides to start talking.

179
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:48,699
Bye, guys. What's happening to me? My darling scientists aren't supposed to fear.

180
00:39:55,719 --> 00:40:11,639
I should be just out of going. Oh, I just swallowed air. Sorry. Cool. Blonsky file detected.

181
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:23,210
I already bought all the moves. Let me try the, um, what was it? Disrespect. Let's go to the city.

182
00:40:32,619 --> 00:40:38,619
Next mission is clean sweep. I can see it. All right. Let's try the elbow drop.

183
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:52,380
Oh, wait, do I have to? Oh, there it is. That's so stupid. I do it from the second rope.

184
00:40:53,340 --> 00:41:21,239
All right. Let's try this on somebody. It works.

185
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:33,989
That move is so good. It's so good. I'm going to use that all the time. Oh, the grind. Right.

186
00:41:33,989 --> 00:41:58,969
Okay. So get a shield, right? Okay. This is bad. This is, how is this? This is slower than running.

187
00:41:59,849 --> 00:43:09,539
Can I jump like this? This is Tony Hawk. Why is it playing twice? Why is it playing twice?

188
00:43:15,139 --> 00:43:25,590
Cause I haven't got, whoops. Hold on. All right. Hold on. Here we go.

189
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:06,809
I don't know when you can do that in Tony Hawk. All right. Let's get this. Hey,

190
00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:11,610
thanks for the five community subs adventure MF Dan and five from Mandalore. Thank you both of you.

191
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:20,300
Play it like Superman. Oh, there's a place where everyone can be happy.

192
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:29,269
My fucking world. All right. Let's go first. Just give me one second.

193
00:44:32,179 --> 00:44:48,409
Okay. Now I know why this game, now I see why this game is fun. They added an elbow drop.

194
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:54,260
Now I get it. What about the bowling ball? I need a big thing to bowl.

195
00:45:14,059 --> 00:45:25,340
Out of mana. Can't do that. Out of mana. Fuck. I gotta get back in the portal. Fuck.

196
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:28,699
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Okay. I'm all right. How many guys do I have left?

197
00:45:31,289 --> 00:46:00,329
Two? Fuck. Okay. I gotta go grind again. Wait, who is that? Bruce. No, get. Come on. You're so

198
00:46:00,329 --> 00:46:06,980
slippery and sticky at the same time. How? Blonsky is overseeing the deployment of gamma suppressing

199
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:12,340
gas pods throughout the downtown core. We don't have time to get into the quantum electrochemistry.

200
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:18,500
Bottom line, exposure to this gas will render you comatose in seconds. It seems the gas is a

201
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:23,460
blend of two slowly reacting agents, giving us a brief window for action. Throw them in the ocean.

202
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:28,260
You'll have to grab each pod, haul it to the coastline and toss it into the ocean before

203
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:37,210
you lose consciousness. Move fast. Have to move and get that gas pod away from you. It could cause

204
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:54,139
you damage. Just throw it into the drinking supply of the whole city. Locate military gas pods,

205
00:46:54,139 --> 00:47:00,650
safely dispose of military gas pods. Don't drink ocean water. Where do you think your water comes

206
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:12,900
from? Ding dong. Comes from the ocean. Comes from water in the earth. Well, I located the...

207
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:36,599
There's a big guy here. Wait. Punch. Did it work? We'll be right back. Right? Somebody do it.

208
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:38,760
Somebody do it. Somebody do it. Somebody do it. Somebody do it. Somebody do it. Somebody do it.

209
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:53,050
All right. I could use my fucking secret technique on this guy.

210
00:47:53,769 --> 00:48:25,610
I missed. Turns out it's a whole lot harder to get this. Punch the missile. I didn't get

211
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:41,269
jibated. I need to do a running uppercut on this guy. You bet. Here I'm gonna do the xxxxxx punch

212
00:48:41,269 --> 00:48:56,460
combo. Hulk is a demon. Uh, no. I mean, he's not biblical in any way. That doesn't make any sense

213
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:13,300
to me. Grab onto him. I tried that. Are you gonna... Seriously? Are you kidding me? Look, grab.

214
00:49:14,019 --> 00:49:26,039
I can't grab him. I gotta say grab him. There's no... I can't grab him. There's no grab. I got a

215
00:49:26,039 --> 00:50:10,730
better idea. Did it work? Turn. Turn. I can't even control him anymore. All right. I'm on a Disney

216
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:18,579
ride right now. Whoa. Look behind you. Take a picture. Take a picture. Oh my God. Look. He's

217
00:50:18,579 --> 00:50:29,300
right there. Wow. Holy shit. That was crazy. Where do they get the technology to do this shit?

218
00:50:30,099 --> 00:50:42,150
Look. Here he comes. Oh my God. Whoa. Mom. Mom. Here he comes. Mom. Keep grabbing my fucking arm.

219
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:53,500
Hard. Ow. Mom. Let go of my fucking arm. I'm sorry, sweetie. Mom. Jesus. I probably marks here

220
00:50:53,500 --> 00:51:13,000
now. I have a sunburn there too. Look. Here come the missiles. Oh, what the fuck. Don't worry.

221
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:28,659
They were not... What? Why did I come back? Why did I come back? Wait. Police. I need your help.

222
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:49,019
You want to go toe to toe? You can do that. You tried to grab me, didn't you? Whoopsie.

223
00:51:55,690 --> 00:52:13,420
Got it. Finish him with an elbow drop. No. Why would I need to finish him with an elbow drop?

224
00:52:14,139 --> 00:52:25,269
Finish him with a slash. Fuck. I shouldn't have done that that loud. Listen to my voice. Listen

225
00:52:25,269 --> 00:52:29,670
to this. I have this in my air pocket in my... Right now, there's an air pocket in my throat.

226
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:36,820
God, I lost it. Did I lose it? Yeah. Fuck. You know when you're eating and your voice...

227
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:42,019
The food gets stuck in a really weird place where your vocal cords are and you end up with this

228
00:52:42,019 --> 00:52:46,900
crazy voice that can never be replicated? I love when that happens and I try to keep it as long as

229
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:54,500
I can. I try to make phone calls when that happens to me. Calling people that I know. Like,

230
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:59,860
here it is. Here it is. Okay. Okay. Calm down. And I'll call like fucking friends and family

231
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:06,340
members and be like, hey, we're not just checking in. That's me imitating it, but it sounds insane

232
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:19,079
when you actually do it. People are like, ermy? Like, yeah. Fucking weirdo. You're a weirdo.

233
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:44,809
Oh, we got another big guy. Can I handle it? He can't even fucking drive. The psycho helicopters

234
00:53:44,809 --> 00:54:05,829
are here. The camera can't even keep up with me because of the helicopters. What? Come here,

235
00:54:05,829 --> 00:54:22,630
I'm grabbing it. I'm so happy I have that move now. That move is so good. 8 out of 0.9 out of 10

236
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:30,170
Xbox magazine. No, I would say this is probably a 2,000 for 8 out of 10. I mean, this is pretty good.

237
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:54,739
I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Is there another one? Oh, it's this guy.

238
00:54:55,780 --> 00:55:14,219
The missiles... I shit don't even work in this scenario. I'd rather just go up and punch him.

239
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:34,539
This shit ain't even reliable. What? Go the X, X, X, X, X combo. Yeah, it's an X, X,

240
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:50,809
pause. X, X, X, X, X, right. X, X, X, pause. X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, pause.

241
00:55:51,530 --> 00:56:21,099
You have to stand still for too long. It's not reliable. Get that fucking help, Q.

242
00:56:21,099 --> 00:57:00,500
I'll be going the wrong way. I don't have time to walk around. Give me the help. I want

243
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:18,659
steel fists. Thank you. No. Okay, pick that up. Throw gas into the ocean. Oh, this is

244
00:57:18,659 --> 00:57:34,090
the gas pod. Throw the gas pod by using Y and then rotating L counterclockwise. What?

245
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:40,150
No, I just, I thought you throw it in the ocean. You don't throw it into the ocean.

246
00:57:41,110 --> 00:58:09,139
Got it, right? All right, next one. I'm coming. Action. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Go, go, go, go, go.

247
00:58:11,219 --> 00:58:38,869
Action. Go, go, go, go, go. Wait, point. I got to get some of these. 10,000 smash points.

248
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:50,630
Bowl the burger. Bowl the burger. Bowl the burger. Bowl the burger. Bowl the burger. Bowl the burger.

249
00:58:56,539 --> 00:59:09,269
Denny's. Fuck. You said the word Denny's. No, I want it. Shit. I wanted Denny's. I can't,

250
00:59:09,269 --> 00:59:18,440
though. I can't get that. I'm going to bowl the burger. Just hold on. I need a good opportunity.

251
00:59:30,869 --> 00:59:35,239
Imagine coming into the stream right now. Like, what were you thinking?

252
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:39,239
What's this cheeseburger? What the heck? Hulk with a cheeseburger?

253
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:57,610
This has got to be a mod. Stop, stop, stop. Come on. Come on. Let me, let me have this one.

254
01:00:01,219 --> 01:00:06,659
You guys, all of you right now, you better do it. The one person that comes in here that we're just

255
01:00:06,659 --> 01:00:10,260
going to, they're going to think it's like really funny. We're going to, they're going to really

256
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:17,260
think that's what we think. This is funny. Everyone has to be like burger XD, like laughing burger,

257
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:27,639
like what the fuck? Eat it. Yum. Like stuff like that. Like, oh, he looks hungry. Be as

258
01:00:27,639 --> 01:00:46,679
horny as possible. Okay. Ready? And action. What? You wait for me. I've got a burger. Hey,

259
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:52,360
what, what do you want some? What do you want some? You can't have any. It's my burger. Only mine.

260
01:00:54,329 --> 01:01:01,139
Man, I thought, I thought I was hungry. What the heck? What the heck is going on here?

261
01:01:03,929 --> 01:01:17,909
Everyone's a piece of my burger. All right. I'll share it with you. Oh, whoops. Yum. Yum. Yum.

262
01:01:19,349 --> 01:01:42,760
It's just so yummy. All right. Watch this. Hey, who ordered it? But this is funnier. This is

263
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:55,420
funnier. Oh, I'm using my burger head as a battering ram. Oh, watch out. It's me. Hope

264
01:01:55,420 --> 01:02:15,079
burger head delivering up fresh beef. Okay. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop it. I demand

265
01:02:15,639 --> 01:02:42,889
stop. Oh shit. I'm in trouble. It was horrible. That's enough. I just said it was enough.

266
01:02:43,849 --> 01:02:54,570
Okay. So how many people came and left? What do you think? More than five. I would say probably

267
01:02:54,570 --> 01:03:20,170
three. Hey, fucking relax. Oh my God. These helicopters are unbelievable. I think, you know

268
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:24,650
what? I think the worst part about that one was, was the like, I'm eating it like yum, yum, yum,

269
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:28,969
yum thing. I think that might have been the worst part. I, that, that's where I would have left.

270
01:03:28,969 --> 01:03:45,909
Right. Where is it? I know it's here. How are you still even flying around like that? You have no

271
01:03:45,909 --> 01:04:22,059
health. You're exploding. That was just showing off for the camera. Okay. Oh, I want the helicopter

272
01:04:22,059 --> 01:04:53,510
that's flying. Where's the helicopter? You've got to be fucking kidding me. You guys didn't think

273
01:04:53,510 --> 01:05:00,309
this was the finale of the 4th of July. Really? Okay. So what, how would you keep telling me that

274
01:05:00,309 --> 01:05:04,469
of what I said yesterday was not accurate? I'd love to hear about your thesis on that.

275
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:29,690
Why can I not punch the missiles back? I gotta, I gotta get out of this. I'm just gonna grab the

276
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:41,349
thing and run. Like why even fight these things? It's just like not even, not even possible.

277
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:59,369
Not even possible. This game's impossible. Wait, did I not even? Come on. No fucking way.

278
01:06:00,329 --> 01:06:03,530
What are you talking about?

279
01:06:08,409 --> 01:06:14,010
I was right. I don't even need to do the stupid big long-winded animation. Just throw it in.

280
01:06:14,889 --> 01:06:26,170
I don't have to do this long-winded Mario thing. Just, just throw it in. Yeah, make sure we get

281
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:33,110
her. Do a hammer throw. No, I don't have to do that. Let's jump, uh, king spot right here.

282
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:49,769
Good. All right. Wait, how is he following me this well? Like how is it possible you follow

283
01:06:49,769 --> 01:06:55,530
me that directly? He's 10 times bigger than me. More than that. Like he's probably 25 times larger

284
01:06:55,530 --> 01:07:25,849
than I am. Let's just skate. All right, I forgot this is the missile game right here. Make funny

285
01:07:25,849 --> 01:07:30,250
burger joke. We already did it. Didn't you laugh at it? We were here when we all laughed at it.

286
01:07:31,289 --> 01:07:42,440
It was very, very, very funny. So throw it into the ocean so I can just turn around and just drop

287
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:51,750
it in. Holds up burger. I mean, it holds up burger. Wait, is that you're doing the holds up like

288
01:07:51,750 --> 01:08:42,949
spork thing? Did I make it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Into the ocean. Got it. I win. Mission complete.

289
01:08:43,670 --> 01:08:57,050
Okay, I did it. So now good. New Blonsky files. Well, I win. No, I do. All right. Next story,

290
01:08:57,050 --> 01:09:20,229
a bird in the hand. Do I have 93,000? No, I didn't want that. Um, exactly what I wanted.

291
01:09:20,869 --> 01:09:54,069
Okay, can I get a reset here? Can I get a reset of the map? Let's go back to the church where

292
01:09:54,069 --> 01:10:04,520
it's safe. $50 came in from Goiki. Thank you Goiki for the $5,000. Sorry, I was doing a little bit

293
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:14,340
yelling there. $5,000 bits from Goiki. $50. They say everyone tweet hashtag burger. Get it trending.

294
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:19,319
I think it already is. I'm pretty sure all popular food items always have like

295
01:10:19,319 --> 01:10:30,279
10 to 20,000 tweets a minute. It's not going to take very much. I'm just gonna buy moves.

296
01:10:31,159 --> 01:10:38,470
But thanks for the $50, Goiki. Thanks for the ridiculous amount of bits. Appreciate it. A ton

297
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:50,920
of fucking money. And thanks for your hashtag burger. All right, 93,000. Air critical. How do

298
01:10:50,920 --> 01:11:07,449
I not have? Don't I already have it? Super air dash. Yes. Really important. Hitchhike. Finally,

299
01:11:07,449 --> 01:11:19,819
I can grab onto those guys. Critical mass, sir. Okay. What about health? Shield grind kick.

300
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:36,939
Wait, is it a kick flip? Definitely get the kick flip. Missile catch. Catch incoming missiles and

301
01:11:36,939 --> 01:11:53,159
hurl them back. Couldn't buy that one fast enough. I want a burger now. Okay, go get one.

302
01:11:53,159 --> 01:12:00,119
Well, no. Well, you can't. No, you can't. Make one. We need to get a handle on these new powers.

303
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:11,930
Just get one. I know. I just said that. I know. Well, I mean, if you could get it from a stop

304
01:12:11,930 --> 01:12:17,079
watching. Why did you? Why? I didn't say that. Yeah. Why would you say that? Still get some.

305
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:21,079
Some drive ups here still are available. Takeout is available, right?

306
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:37,659
All right, let's do this. All right. Grab and then throw it back. Well, that was off the screen.

307
01:12:37,659 --> 01:12:47,909
I couldn't see it. Uncle burger at home. Yeah, you can do that. To be in Ross's shoes. The

308
01:12:47,909 --> 01:12:54,840
military's insurance bill is going to skyrocket. Wait, you just throw it back.

309
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:08,039
You're not supposed to do it like that, but okay. You catch it and then you hold B.

310
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:14,010
I just whipped it back. All right, let's go. Well, I can only grab one at a time,

311
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:16,489
so it doesn't really matter. Ash is much better though.

312
01:13:30,329 --> 01:13:38,739
Hulk is a stoner. You know, I was thinking about saying the oh, I hold the missile and it's like a

313
01:13:38,739 --> 01:13:42,739
big joint, right? I was thinking about it, but that figured it was that was going to put a lot

314
01:13:42,739 --> 01:13:47,300
of minus twos in the chat. But somebody you said it so you can take the blame on that one.

315
01:13:48,260 --> 01:14:15,180
No funny weed. I didn't say it. I told you I didn't say it. Holy shit. That's really far.

316
01:14:24,659 --> 01:14:38,729
That's is there a level three on this too? I hope so. I smoked a bong today. Well,

317
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:43,670
I would really highly recommend not like breaking down glass and smoking.

318
01:14:47,000 --> 01:15:05,340
I hope that's not what you mean. You know, I'm so hungry. I need a big burger. I'm so

319
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:07,899
hungry. Cut his mic. No, keep it on.

320
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:26,859
Wait for the cop. Wait, wait till the copter lands and then grab fuel rod.

321
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:36,649
Stop doing the burger. Funny thing. We did that already. You're scaring away new viewers.

322
01:15:37,609 --> 01:15:57,420
47 seconds. Reap what you sow. Yeah, and I guess I did. I reaped what I sowed.

323
01:15:58,859 --> 01:16:14,699
I pulled the plant up. We've cultivated it and it's gone now. I planted those seeds

324
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:19,510
and then the harvest came and we harvested that joke and now it's done.

325
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:46,170
I'm not even fucking there. It doesn't count. You can't just smoke the jokes without sharing, bro.

326
01:16:47,050 --> 01:17:16,810
We gotta just bunny hop. Let's waste the time. Just do this. Only this.

327
01:17:18,010 --> 01:17:30,710
Okay. That was, I made up so much more time there. All right. I made it. Helicopter coming in.

328
01:17:31,430 --> 01:18:07,369
Punch helicopter. Good. Hey, destroy helicopter. He's going fast. What the fuck? I don't understand.

329
01:18:07,369 --> 01:18:19,819
What is a jet flying around the building? What in the name of God? How did it even get over there?

330
01:18:33,260 --> 01:19:19,239
Come here. Come over here. He's too fast. Think fast. All right. Now, thanks for giving me any

331
01:19:19,239 --> 01:19:28,069
time at all that you can figure out what the hell is happening. Just beat these guys up. You know

332
01:19:28,069 --> 01:19:33,779
what I mean? Just beat them up. I don't have a time limit. This guy's going to follow me the fuck

333
01:19:33,779 --> 01:19:59,750
around for that. I don't think. No, don't do an elbow. I can't. I have to. All right. Now do it.

334
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:08,970
This is like fighting with like, this is fighting with hulk hands with like your little brother.

335
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:18,199
You know what I mean? Watch out. Oh, I'm going to get you. This is how you jump. I'm coming like

336
01:20:18,199 --> 01:20:40,140
off the sofa. I'm so bad. I'm not. He's just so good. Thank you. Thanks. I humiliate him.

337
01:20:45,579 --> 01:21:05,029
10,000 smash points. Okay. Now I'm ready. Wait inside the building. Oh, I got another 10,000

338
01:21:05,029 --> 01:21:18,619
smash points. I meant to do that. Oh shit. I didn't get it. No, I don't get it. I have to.

339
01:21:21,619 --> 01:21:39,460
Oh, you think so? You think you're in control? This fuel cell. Oh,

340
01:21:41,779 --> 01:21:47,319
he called in. Oh, speaking of. Oh, wait. No, don't. Oh my God. I'm going to break this.

341
01:21:50,119 --> 01:22:29,479
I don't want to break it. Okay. Give me this. Just pick it up. Get it. Oh my God. This fucking

342
01:22:29,479 --> 01:22:40,949
just nestled everywhere. Where's that jump pad? Am I? Where am I? This thing's, this thing's gonna

343
01:22:40,949 --> 01:22:51,850
crack. Pick up the hamburger. I'm not going to pick up the fucking hamburger.

344
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:46,659
Just missed me motherfucker. Added 15,000 smasher points. Be patient. Closer than we've ever been.

345
01:23:53,239 --> 01:23:56,859
To break any moment. He can't keep the beast inside him.

346
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:09,560
Once we capture him, I'll transformation. I'm beginning to understand the appeal.

347
01:24:10,119 --> 01:24:25,689
What was that noise by the way? Wrong with this guy. Yep. People say that every day.

348
01:24:25,689 --> 01:24:37,449
Okay. Doesn't mean it's true. I have to get across the city, Bruce now, but we're under lockdown.

349
01:24:37,449 --> 01:24:41,770
My division informant has a new decrypt code. I need that info. And he's not

350
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:48,409
by the roadblocks. I don't like it. Something's wrong here. Just worry about keeping me safe.

351
01:24:48,409 --> 01:24:53,130
Keep Doc Sampson alive. What is he going to be walking around with like a briefcase?

352
01:24:53,130 --> 01:25:02,010
Heck Sampson. He's going to be in a car. I feel like he's going to be in a limo.

353
01:25:02,010 --> 01:25:14,149
Right. Don't you see that? I foresee this guy in a limousine. Nope. He's in an SUV. Okay.

354
01:25:18,439 --> 01:25:25,029
Am I in that car? I just ran somebody over.

355
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:49,880
Oh, he's driving. How is this driving? Protect Sampson's car. From what exactly?

356
01:25:50,439 --> 01:26:05,380
We couldn't have got a better car than this. Can't we get like an armored car? Why don't we get

357
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:10,789
like a Subaru Outback? You think we would get a fucking armored car with like bulletproof glass

358
01:26:10,789 --> 01:26:33,340
and oh, the roadblock. All right. Go on. You go. Go. Full speed ahead. Oh, there's tanks here.

359
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:57,579
Nevermind. Stay there. I can't pick up the debris. Try this again.

360
01:26:57,579 --> 01:27:12,140
Here comes a meltdown mission. No, not yet. You get the tank grab upgrade. I should get all upgrades

361
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:24,680
guys. So they're looking for suspicious activity. So instead of just driving normally, you decide

362
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:37,109
to run the guy over. Why didn't you just like just lie to these people? Excuse me, sir. I'm with

363
01:27:37,109 --> 01:27:43,539
Uber Eats. Oh, okay. All right. Right. Good. I'm delivering a package. I'm working for the post

364
01:27:43,539 --> 01:27:55,500
office. Oh, okay. All right. See you later. Package from Uber Eats. No, I'm just saying like

365
01:27:55,500 --> 01:28:26,869
people that deliver stuff. Oh, that would have been so bad. I just dropped a fridge on him.

366
01:28:26,869 --> 01:28:55,659
All right. Catch him. There's a psycho chopper. Hold on. Let me take care of this. No, pick it up.

367
01:28:56,300 --> 01:29:25,529
Give me the help. Help. Oh, he's still alive. This motherfucker's almost dead. Where's this

368
01:29:25,529 --> 01:29:45,159
other person? Oh my god. Burger. Let me have that one. Please let me have that one. Please.

369
01:29:47,430 --> 01:29:52,970
I know you guys are thinking the same thing. I know you are. Okay. Let's block him.

370
01:29:55,689 --> 01:30:23,460
I'll get in my car. We can drive around together. Wait, where's it? I get it. Fade away. I love

371
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:43,350
doing the fade away. It's the best. It's the most fun. Banner. Banner. Surrender banner. Don't go

372
01:30:43,350 --> 01:31:04,460
right next to the tank, you idiot. Oh, he's left. He left. He left. He left. He's fine.

373
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:56,010
This is a pretty strong car in front of us. God damn it. Hit it. Hit him. Oh, this is bad.

374
01:31:56,649 --> 01:32:32,739
Holy shit. I'm dead. Oh, this one's going to suck. I need the tank upgrades. Yeah. All right.

375
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:35,699
I'll give it one more go and then I'm going to get the tank upgrade.

376
01:32:36,340 --> 01:33:00,949
The throw tank. Watch that same guy get hit. All right. We got to make this quick. He already

377
01:33:00,949 --> 01:33:11,350
left. All right. Stay with him the whole time. I got to make it quick. Get the fists. Stay with

378
01:33:11,350 --> 01:33:21,079
him. Keep it around at least 80% health if I can. I'll try. Where are we at? Right here. First block.

379
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:57,300
Am I getting ahead of him? I'm just going to get ahead of him. What am I even supposed to do?

380
01:33:57,300 --> 01:34:15,100
I'm not getting hit by a thousand missiles. Okay. Well, when they fire 10 million rounds at you,

381
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:37,300
I'm getting a tank upgrade. We tried catching missiles. Well, the interesting thing about the

382
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:45,859
catching missile upgrade is you catch one while 60 hits you in the back. It's interesting how

383
01:34:45,859 --> 01:35:07,369
that works. No, don't start that one. All right. I need, I want like 70,000 points.

384
01:35:08,090 --> 01:35:23,670
Let's do a mission. Are you guys still on board, girl? Get the soldier into the air as many times

385
01:35:23,670 --> 01:35:34,739
as possible without letting him touch the ground. All right. Let's give it a try. Can I use grabs?

386
01:35:34,739 --> 01:35:37,699
Can I just throw him up and catch him and throw him up and catch him and throw him up and catch

387
01:35:37,699 --> 01:36:19,239
him? Hey, juggle the soldier. Did I fail? I got one. Wait a minute. Is it X and like up or X and

388
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:30,010
do it away from him or something? Right. Okay. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Okay. I get it. So

389
01:36:30,010 --> 01:36:52,779
go like this. Oh, you got to hit back and X at the same time. Give me a bit of camera angle.

390
01:36:52,779 --> 01:37:06,010
This camera is terrible. Maybe don't even lock on. Should I not lock? No, you have to lock on.

391
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:42,420
Ah, shit. Lock on changed. Give me a 10. 10. No. Well, got it. Silver medal. I don't care.

392
01:37:42,420 --> 01:38:05,930
That's fine. 4,000 points. Cool. This guy's a silver streamer. I'd rather have the silver

393
01:38:05,930 --> 01:38:08,970
medal. Then haven't we talked about this? How second place is better than first place?

394
01:38:09,930 --> 01:38:15,770
Because I was very, very good, but I don't have to, I don't have to be the best because then I have

395
01:38:15,770 --> 01:38:24,579
a ton of expectations. You get in first place, then all of a sudden you're the expectation now.

396
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:40,789
I don't want first place. I want second place. In fact, I want like fourth place because you did

397
01:38:40,789 --> 01:38:44,149
really good. You didn't like place, but holy shit, like how many people were doing that?

398
01:38:44,869 --> 01:38:51,460
Well, there was like 40 people doing that. Got to like eighth place. That's fucking kind of high.

399
01:38:52,100 --> 01:39:01,720
That's pretty good. Okay. Use your club to hit the soldier as far as possible. Charge the attack

400
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:09,800
to increase the distance. See how far you can hit the soldier. Now, by the way, fourth place is

401
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:16,949
placing if you go by Super Nintendo Mario Kart standards. And that's the standards that I go by.

402
01:39:28,979 --> 01:39:35,770
All right. I can get, I can do like 500 yards. All right. No, no, no, no, no. Okay. All right.

403
01:39:35,770 --> 01:39:46,779
This is fun. You got to get a full charge. Oh, I got it. I could have done it a little earlier.

404
01:39:47,420 --> 01:40:03,399
279. Oh, you got to get under it. That was all right. That was pretty good.

405
01:40:04,340 --> 01:40:27,180
300. 300. I got under it. 384. Come on. 295. 300. Get it. Jump and do it.

406
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:42,569
I threw it. That's me. That guy just died for no reason. It doesn't work like that.

407
01:40:44,170 --> 01:40:53,449
No, I'm hitting them. Oh, my chest.

408
01:40:57,739 --> 01:41:10,119
For no reason. I know. I know. I know. But wait, let me try Y. That's definitely over 300 yards.

409
01:41:10,119 --> 01:41:20,859
Holy shit. That's like 400. It's Y, not X. Get one more. I'm going to do this one again. I can

410
01:41:20,859 --> 01:41:42,949
give, I definitely can do it. They all are dying for no reason. I know. And let's go like this.

411
01:41:43,750 --> 01:42:04,729
It's a lot longer. Come on. 400. Oh, I got him right in the toe. I got way underneath him. That's

412
01:42:04,729 --> 01:42:38,100
probably going to be pretty good. Come on. That was perfect. Oh, right. X and Y.

413
01:42:43,399 --> 01:43:13,770
That didn't work. I'm just making him fall faster. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Try to do it.

414
01:43:14,250 --> 01:43:26,069
I'm trying. I'll get it. I'll get it. Hold on. Got it. That was horrible. It was fucking terrible.

415
01:43:32,699 --> 01:43:40,779
I'll get it right here. I'll get it right here. I'll get it right here. One more after this. I got

416
01:43:40,779 --> 01:43:49,579
to get to 400. That would have been it. No, it wouldn't have. Knock them in the air, then do it.

417
01:43:51,239 --> 01:44:07,109
Wait. Hold on. Hold on a second. You're telling me hit them and then throw it at them. Not a bad

418
01:44:07,109 --> 01:44:14,170
idea. You'd be bad at baseball. Only baseballs don't come from the sky. They come forward.

419
01:44:14,729 --> 01:44:44,250
Let's try this. Let's try this. It might work. Hold on. Oh, I think somebody called the police.

420
01:44:47,689 --> 01:44:56,659
You're a little late. I'll be honest. I've been doing this for like two hours. Wait, what?

421
01:45:00,710 --> 01:45:34,920
Let me use something else. Oh, no. Fuck. I tried running. I have to get gold on this.

422
01:45:41,619 --> 01:46:15,130
Holy shit. He just said look out on his radio. Fuck. God. Stop jumping. I have to. I have to.

423
01:46:15,130 --> 01:46:19,109
I have to. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. I'm going to get like extra,

424
01:46:19,109 --> 01:46:49,619
like if you jump and punch, like you know what I mean? No, it's the same. Holy shit. Hold on.

425
01:46:55,859 --> 01:47:08,229
No, I didn't want to throw it behind me. Stop giving this to me.

426
01:47:16,659 --> 01:47:21,989
I can do it. I'm going to want to do it with the pole. It's going to be 5,000 yards.

427
01:47:22,630 --> 01:47:29,340
Can I just die? Retry. Restart. Here we go. I'm going to get the pole and I'm going to hit him

428
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:42,250
into the fucking stratosphere. Don't do it immediately. Just wait. Okay. Ready?

429
01:47:43,369 --> 01:48:34,300
So like knock this down. I exploded. Oh, you motherfucker. That's going to be pretty good.

430
01:48:34,300 --> 01:49:13,529
366. Fully charged hit won't go to 400. Why not? Throw it after hitting him. I'm trying that every

431
01:49:13,529 --> 01:49:27,779
time. It's not going to make it. That was pretty far. 350, 360, 424. I got it. That's gold medal.

432
01:49:27,779 --> 01:49:46,420
I just got it. All right. I can do better than that. It's right before you do the full charge.

433
01:49:47,220 --> 01:50:11,539
That's going to be at least 400. Come on. One more shot. That's pretty good. That's going to be a

434
01:50:11,539 --> 01:50:20,619
good one. And too bad it was the last one I just did. Oh, now that one's terrible. All right. I got

435
01:50:20,619 --> 01:50:41,739
it. Gold medal. Now do a little dance. Yeah. All right. Jump to the church to acquire mission.

436
01:50:41,739 --> 01:50:45,819
All right. So I want to do, I got $67. I want to do more. I like these little mini games. They're

437
01:50:45,819 --> 01:50:53,720
fun. I'm going to do more of these. I'm going to do more of these. These are fun. Do a dance. I just

438
01:50:53,720 --> 01:51:08,949
did because you don't see it. I'll do this last one. Then we'll do the story. I'm going to get

439
01:51:08,949 --> 01:51:18,140
the tank upgrade. The one that makes it so I can kill tanks really easily. Oh no. I already did

440
01:51:18,140 --> 01:51:28,539
that one. This one. Soldier seeker. Defeat as many enemies as possible before the time runs out.

441
01:51:28,539 --> 01:51:55,159
Play the automaton. The automaton has a name. Kill everything. Get the guy up here first.

442
01:51:59,859 --> 01:52:04,779
Where's the next one? On the building. Oh, that was not good.

443
01:52:06,859 --> 01:52:25,020
Where is he? They're on the roofs. Where is he? Up top. It's both the helicopters. Oh my God.

444
01:52:25,020 --> 01:52:50,069
Just forget to kill the guys on the ground first. You're going to fall off, aren't I?

445
01:52:50,949 --> 01:53:25,899
I did let go. I didn't want to let go. Come here. How many yards? Okay. All right. All right.

446
01:53:25,899 --> 01:53:34,890
Where's the last dude up there? That guy's fucking dead. One, two, three. All right. What's left?

447
01:53:35,529 --> 01:53:51,430
He's alive. He's alive. He's alive. Oh, he's not. Oh, there's a guy right there. Oh, I got it.

448
01:53:54,329 --> 01:53:59,579
Whatever. Bronze. Who cares? Winks are crashing. Sell. You can't even sell them. They don't exist

449
01:53:59,579 --> 01:54:12,180
anymore. They've been delisted from the marketplace. You can't sell something that's

450
01:54:12,180 --> 01:54:18,710
not even available to sell. All right. Let's go back to the church. We have 70,000 points.

451
01:54:19,979 --> 01:54:37,960
We need to jump. All right. Here we go. What's the move called? The one that you're talking about?

452
01:54:38,680 --> 01:55:03,399
Good one. It's called a wink. That'd be funny if it was. Okay. Sonic clap. Air enemy grapple. Yeah.

453
01:55:04,039 --> 01:55:14,659
Got these. Elbow drop. Super air strike. No, no, no. Shockwave smash repeater. That's cool,

454
01:55:14,659 --> 01:55:25,319
but I don't want it. Air critical thunderclap. Hammer toss. Grab and spin any tanks. There it is.

455
01:55:26,279 --> 01:55:38,199
Okay. Grab a tank and then spin. Dirty ball and chain. Utilize a wrecking ball for wide

456
01:55:38,199 --> 01:55:46,920
sweeping attacks. Air spike. From an air combo, slam Hulk's foes to the ground.

457
01:55:47,479 --> 01:55:54,119
That's cool, but hold on. Target kick. Hulk can ride an aircraft and kick it toward the

458
01:55:54,119 --> 01:56:00,460
target of your choice. I want that. I can throw one helicopter into the other helicopter.

459
01:56:01,260 --> 01:56:12,760
Critical pain. Power surge level two. Oh, this is health. Running club ram.

460
01:56:13,720 --> 01:56:25,609
Yeah, it gives me. All right. I'm going to save up now. Toontown. Isn't there, there's a,

461
01:56:25,609 --> 01:56:33,380
I can't you play Toontown? Should I play Toontown? Isn't it like, isn't it like Toontown

462
01:56:33,380 --> 01:56:47,619
reloaded or something or remastered? Sir Canine just gave $50. Thank you for the huge bit drop.

463
01:56:48,420 --> 01:56:54,819
Thanks for the 5,000 bits. That's a lot of fucking money. 5,000 of them. And they say,

464
01:56:55,619 --> 01:57:01,539
Germa, I've redeemed my Germa wank earlier for 10 million channel points and didn't even get one.

465
01:57:01,539 --> 01:57:17,350
Can I get a Wink as a re recomp, recomp, recompensation? Why did you read that? Because

466
01:57:17,350 --> 01:57:34,680
somebody gave me $50. That was a $50 donation. That was Sir Canine. No, you, there was never

467
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:40,520
any agreement for anything you're saying. Winks are delisted. They don't exist. Sorry. This is

468
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:56,300
the way it is. Where's this mission? Where's the mission? Isn't there a story mission here?

469
01:57:58,649 --> 01:58:03,609
Scam. Oh, yeah. If you're looking for Winks, you scammed yourself because they're gone.

470
01:58:04,409 --> 01:58:23,739
Very addicted to them. All right. Where's the story? Is this the wrong area or something? What's

471
01:58:23,739 --> 01:58:47,739
going on? No burgers. Naked streamers scams viewers. I mean, another $50 from Sir Canine.

472
01:58:47,739 --> 01:58:54,460
That's $100 in bits so far. That's 10,000 bits from Sir Canine. And they say that's a lot. Canine,

473
01:58:54,460 --> 01:58:59,939
thanks for the hundred fucking dollars. That's insane. That's crazy. They say, does that mean

474
01:58:59,939 --> 01:59:04,979
I can get a Germa wank because those aren't delisted? Also play Toontown. They were never

475
01:59:04,979 --> 01:59:12,020
listed in the first place. Winks have been delisted. Wanks were never listed. So I'm sorry.

476
01:59:12,659 --> 01:59:16,180
There is this. It was never listed in the first place.

477
01:59:22,260 --> 01:59:42,149
How come this mission is not showing up? Soft low mega low. Oh, is the raw. Okay.

478
01:59:43,029 --> 01:59:48,439
I have to get across this. Annoyings. Now, but we're. Thanks for the hundred bucks.

479
01:59:49,319 --> 01:59:55,079
But I'm not. No, I'm not going to. No, I'm not going to do that thing. I'm not going to do that

480
01:59:55,079 --> 01:59:59,479
on stream. I'm not going to do that. No, I'm not. All right. I'm done. We're done.

481
02:00:03,159 --> 02:00:10,090
So here we go. Now I got the tank grabber move and I get a couple of hog champs for the tank

482
02:00:10,090 --> 02:00:19,109
grabber move. Don't give in. There's no giving in. Are you talking? What are you talking about?

483
02:00:19,109 --> 02:00:44,659
Don't give in. Protect whatever. I got the line wrong. Improvisation. Look it up. Captain do

484
02:00:44,659 --> 02:01:00,380
anything. I knew you were sneaking up on me. You and your friend and I didn't even do the move.

485
02:01:11,060 --> 02:01:31,590
Taking them into the ocean with me. I got them both. But that's a good start. Let me get. So

486
02:01:31,590 --> 02:01:37,350
let me get this straight. We are doing. I'm getting the silent treatment right now because

487
02:01:37,989 --> 02:01:41,430
you guys want me to let me get this right here. Let me make sure this is very clear.

488
02:01:42,390 --> 02:01:48,069
You've given me the silent treatment because you are expecting me to masturbate on stream.

489
02:01:48,869 --> 02:01:54,149
I just want to make sure I'm very clear about this. Is that really what we're doing?

490
02:01:55,109 --> 02:02:15,000
How far have you fallen? Swing it. Swing it quick. Holy shit it works. Oh that's very easy now.

491
02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:37,579
Did a boss that four days ago. Wait. Psycho coppers. Coppers. You know whatever. Got it.

492
02:02:37,579 --> 02:02:49,670
Okay good. No I'm not going to give in. I'm not giving in. Why would I give in?

493
02:02:50,630 --> 02:03:00,729
Why would I give in? This is not hog of you. Just standing next to the car. Just fucking run

494
02:03:00,729 --> 02:03:09,340
them over man. I'm a not hog of you. No that's not going to happen. This hurricane I'm giving

495
02:03:09,340 --> 02:03:16,619
another $50. Another 5,000 bits. $150 worth of bits have come in to try to get me to wink.

496
02:03:17,420 --> 02:03:22,729
Not going to happen. Not going to happen. I'm sorry. It's not going to happen. They say a wink

497
02:03:22,729 --> 02:03:26,810
would work. Not going to happen. I'm going to have to be honest with you. It's not happening.

498
02:03:27,609 --> 02:03:38,500
I'm just going to crush them. Thanks for the insane amount of money. But I can't.

499
02:03:39,220 --> 02:03:54,119
I can't. You can't relist something. Okay I'm doing this on my own. I want to do this because

500
02:03:54,119 --> 02:04:02,760
I feel like doing it. Zit shut up. Shut up. How dare you say that to me right now.

501
02:04:08,470 --> 02:04:15,189
Immediate. Immediate. Immediate. Zit. Immediate call out. The camera was on for a tenth of a second.

502
02:04:15,750 --> 02:04:31,850
Zit. Oh yeah okay thank you. Nice room. Thanks. I think so too. I'm not. All right.

503
02:04:39,739 --> 02:04:48,260
He's so far ahead of me. Oh shit. Is he all right? Okay. Why are you stopping here?

504
02:04:50,250 --> 02:05:19,909
Why is he stopping? Oh my god the tanks. This wouldn't happen if you played Pathologic 2.

505
02:05:20,630 --> 02:05:44,300
What the fuck are you talking about? Hurry dude. The uber food is getting cold.

506
02:05:48,140 --> 02:06:08,460
Oh shit we're going to hit that guaranteed 25 minute delivery. Okay. Oh kick us up. Stop

507
02:06:08,460 --> 02:06:16,729
driving. He's driving on the sidewalk. You're doing damage to yourself. Come on. We got tanks.

508
02:06:17,770 --> 02:06:51,420
Watch this shit. Watch this shit. Somebody over here. Tank. Tank. Tank. God damn it. Watch your

509
02:06:51,420 --> 02:07:13,750
fire. I gotta ball this. Into the tank. Ball it into the tank. Ball it into the tank.

510
02:07:14,390 --> 02:07:43,189
Okay. Don't care anymore. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Done. Done. Another task.

511
02:07:43,829 --> 02:08:12,539
Done. You can go now. Wait for me to get out of the way first. Fucking idiot. He is an idiot.

512
02:08:12,539 --> 02:08:17,750
All right. He's an idiot. What do you want me to say? He's not an idiot.

513
02:08:18,470 --> 02:08:22,630
And what he was doing right there was smart. You want me to not call the guy driving on the

514
02:08:22,630 --> 02:08:35,449
sidewalk an idiot. Okay. Look at this. This guy's being controlled remotely by a shitty wi-fi signal.

515
02:08:36,250 --> 02:08:53,529
Nobody even in that fucking car. Holy shit. What? Why am I taking damage? Oh. Whoa. Wow.

516
02:08:54,489 --> 02:09:18,170
Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Unbelievable. Oh, there's a checkpoint. Oh. Okay. Here they come.

517
02:09:18,170 --> 02:09:44,439
Come on. Drop. The Yeti's coming out. Fire is releasing.

518
02:09:51,020 --> 02:10:08,899
How? All right. Throw it at somebody else. Thank God it works. I'm seeing F.

519
02:10:11,460 --> 02:10:16,149
All right. F. I got zero drop frames. Why? Why are you guys doing this to me?

520
02:10:16,149 --> 02:10:33,779
Don't tell them. Because you threw a tank at somebody. Oh. Why is it that I automatically

521
02:10:33,779 --> 02:10:38,579
just assume that F means your internet's not working and your stream is dead? I think I'm

522
02:10:38,579 --> 02:10:43,859
just so fucked up from having so many internet problems that I see FFF and I'm like, oh shit,

523
02:10:43,859 --> 02:11:01,000
it's over. Internet says the stream's turned off. Stream's off. I'm so traumatized. All right. Let's

524
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:29,640
go. Pick him up and flick him. Ah, there it is. See you later. Not over. Wait. Oh. When are we

525
02:11:29,640 --> 02:11:39,300
going to reach our destination? Can we get there? This guy's taking the shittiest route possible.

526
02:11:39,939 --> 02:12:07,699
Watch this. Got a bolt. Why is he driving around like this? Come here. One of you. I'm catching this.

527
02:12:08,579 --> 02:12:22,579
He got one off at the end. No, he did not. Give me your mic. Give me your mic. Give me your mic.

528
02:12:22,579 --> 02:12:28,180
Hey. Hey. Streamer. Hey. Check your audio settings. Something might be wrong with them.

529
02:12:28,819 --> 02:12:53,880
There's something wrong with your audio settings. There's so many. There's too many. I have to start

530
02:12:53,880 --> 02:13:02,229
throwing cars, man. There's too many. Oh, that's his car. Wait. All right. Give me the tank or

531
02:13:02,229 --> 02:13:13,670
something. Go, go. Please don't get killed. It's the same shit that happened last time.

532
02:13:14,470 --> 02:13:48,100
What? Ah, give me help. Please. Holy fuck. I did it. That was horrible. The Blonsky file.

533
02:13:50,550 --> 02:13:59,050
Big zip, man. You've been stressed. No, no, not at all. Not at all. My dog was just

534
02:14:00,010 --> 02:14:07,369
in the hospital last week. Had to move during a global pandemic. It hasn't been any stress in my

535
02:14:07,369 --> 02:14:28,869
life. Play Cities Skylines. Cry. Hey. Hey. Hold on. Hey. Hey. That was like a radio kind of YouTuber

536
02:14:28,869 --> 02:14:54,869
hey. My other voice. You're at the peak of your power. Well, not yet. Not yet. Why does he sound

537
02:14:54,949 --> 02:15:14,149
like that? I don't want to do the BB unit thing, but I will because I like it. It's fun. I might

538
02:15:14,149 --> 02:15:34,760
just do it. I'm thinking about it. All right. This is called my other voice. Everything's coming to

539
02:15:34,760 --> 02:15:40,520
fruition. Now I need you to strike at their heart. The division has set up a front in the financial

540
02:15:40,520 --> 02:15:46,920
district and they're spreading their poison in plain sight. We can't allow them a foothold there.

541
02:15:46,920 --> 02:15:52,279
What about civilians? There are no civilians in that vicinity anymore. It's just you versus them.

542
02:16:10,779 --> 02:16:11,420
All right. I'm going to

543
02:16:21,739 --> 02:16:37,260
defeat division forces. Destroy the fuel depot. Destroy everything.

544
02:16:39,340 --> 02:16:43,209
As everyone. Germa gave out a wild to seven out of 10.

545
02:16:44,010 --> 02:16:49,659
It's unfortunately untrue. I don't know why it's unfortunately untrue, but it's not true.

546
02:16:50,620 --> 02:17:43,829
I feel like I just opened up G mod bond just 10 of every enemy and just put them all hostile

547
02:17:43,829 --> 02:17:55,000
versus each other. You know, when you do that shit, see what happens with the total fucking carnage.

548
02:17:55,639 --> 02:18:09,059
Oh dude, I wonder what happens when seven guys in suits fight 20 helicopters. This would be

549
02:18:09,059 --> 02:18:15,290
interesting. And you forget about the tank that you spawned. It's just kind of there. Oh yeah. I

550
02:18:15,290 --> 02:18:18,969
did spawn a tank. Fuck. I'm going to have to do this again. It's not, that's it. That's a bad

551
02:18:18,969 --> 02:18:21,690
variable. This is not a good indicator. I'm going to have to get after the tank is gone.

552
02:18:37,299 --> 02:18:58,540
There's just too many of them. I just, I really did just give that guy a diamond cutter. That's

553
02:18:58,540 --> 02:19:12,299
an RKO. Yeah. How many of you guys remember? I remember being on a trampoline and having

554
02:19:12,299 --> 02:19:18,600
to deal with these little wrestle buddy things that they were like two feet tall and they were

555
02:19:18,600 --> 02:19:23,799
stuffed animal kind of things. It was like, Oh, Ted DiBiase and the ultimate warrior.

556
02:19:24,440 --> 02:19:28,120
And I used to just do wrestling moves to these guys. You're supposed to, that wasn't a commercial

557
02:19:28,120 --> 02:19:33,559
and shit. I would do wrestling moves to them on the trampoline. We would go over to a friend's

558
02:19:33,559 --> 02:19:38,600
house and like, Oh, let's do wrestling moves. We would do shit like that. We'd pick them up

559
02:19:38,600 --> 02:19:59,829
and give them like stunners DDT fucking exploded. Hi, please. I need your help. I need his help.

560
02:20:00,629 --> 02:20:51,510
Explode. I can get the fucking help. Shield, please. Oh my God. You're kidding me. Run. Did I get

561
02:20:51,510 --> 02:22:29,780
them? Okay. Run. Relentless. Oh, I want a coin. Why is this guy lit up? Dead. Hey, you little

562
02:22:29,780 --> 02:23:13,879
fuck. They never stop. It never stops. Should never stop. Fucking headache mission. This whole

563
02:23:13,879 --> 02:23:36,549
game is a headache. Yeah, I agree. Am I going to regen yet? What the fuck? They're gonna die.

564
02:23:37,750 --> 02:23:43,750
It's just never ending. Insta 50,000 mile per hour helicopters just grind into buildings and

565
02:23:43,750 --> 02:24:03,700
into walls and shit. Hey, look at this. I don't know what I'm looking at. You kids beat this.

566
02:24:03,780 --> 02:24:09,500
Yeah, on because they put it on easy and they probably know they didn't bullshit. They played

567
02:24:09,500 --> 02:24:13,819
on easy the first three levels and moved on to something else because kids have the attention

568
02:24:13,819 --> 02:24:23,479
spans of fucking squirrels. Okay, that's incorrect. You're about I beat this game when I was a kid.

569
02:24:23,479 --> 02:24:27,799
No, you beat the first level on easy and then you forgot it existed and then your mother

570
02:24:27,799 --> 02:24:33,459
brought it to like a donation box. That's probably what happened before you sold it.

571
02:24:33,780 --> 02:24:59,850
You're like dad sold it and he forgot about it and then 30 years later you ask your mom. Hey,

572
02:24:59,850 --> 02:25:07,350
Bob. What happened to that? Wasn't there a Hulk game that we had before? Oh, yeah. I have no idea

573
02:25:07,350 --> 02:25:11,750
what happened to that. You stopped playing that after 10 minutes, honey. Oh, really? Because I

574
02:25:11,750 --> 02:25:15,909
keep telling the streamer on Twitch that like I beat every game we ever played and I just want

575
02:25:15,909 --> 02:25:19,829
to like make sure that I have save files still so I can like fucking stick screenshot of the save

576
02:25:19,829 --> 02:25:24,069
file and I got to the end of the fucking game and I'm gonna have a screenshot that says 2004

577
02:25:24,069 --> 02:25:29,750
uh 4 6 0 6 p.m and it's gonna be the final mission of save file. Yeah, we don't have that.

578
02:25:33,139 --> 02:25:53,659
No, honey. We don't. I need help. This is what it feels like to just put like a paper bag on

579
02:25:53,659 --> 02:26:08,500
your head and just run around your room into fucking walls. It's the same thing. You don't

580
02:26:08,659 --> 02:26:14,600
know what's happening. It's just I'm on like a shitload of drugs running around with like a bag

581
02:26:14,600 --> 02:26:19,719
on my head or something. I have like a blindfold on on a bunch of fucking crack

582
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:38,280
circling the same room and this is what's going on in my head. There's mutants and aliens everywhere.

583
02:26:38,280 --> 02:27:14,979
Oh shit we're under attack. I did catch this banner. Fuck you. I did it. My god.

584
02:27:15,700 --> 02:27:54,920
It's sort of elbow drop. That's not it. Destroy all hulkbusters and then stomp them.

585
02:28:01,219 --> 02:28:12,459
Go juggle and then he explodes and then we get help. One um what's it what they call busters?

586
02:28:13,829 --> 02:28:32,709
No, punk punk buster. No, it's a hunk buster. One hunk buster. The incredible hunk.

587
02:28:33,590 --> 02:28:40,360
That's definitely the name of uh that's the title of the porn. It has to be. You know,

588
02:28:40,360 --> 02:28:45,940
that has to be. This guy like just painted green.

589
02:29:09,940 --> 02:29:17,209
He's definitely like painted green like with fucking like I don't know like party store makeup.

590
02:29:17,930 --> 02:29:21,750
It's just like streaks all over him. They didn't give a fuck. They didn't even try.

591
02:29:22,790 --> 02:29:49,670
Like a third of the guy's back ain't even green. The hulk Halloween costume. Yeah,

592
02:29:49,670 --> 02:30:03,049
but the hulk mask on. Oh yeah we're talking about one of those plastic hulk masks. The ones that

593
02:30:03,049 --> 02:30:08,969
just barely cover the front of your face and aren't sized properly so sometimes your face

594
02:30:08,969 --> 02:30:15,129
might be a little too big and your real chin cheeks and forehead bleed out on the edges.

595
02:30:16,010 --> 02:30:38,280
I think I caught one. Huge one. Of course there's a big ass hulk buster. No,

596
02:30:38,280 --> 02:31:28,409
fright him. Punch him in the fucking head. I can't even see. I'm gonna run this way for a

597
02:31:28,409 --> 02:31:40,889
minute. Oh my god, I literally can't even. No, I can't even start crying Jupiter.

598
02:31:57,899 --> 02:32:03,899
Break this building. How am I supposed to destroy this? Okay, I thought my head just got fucking

599
02:32:04,620 --> 02:32:07,579
splattered on the back of that. Did you see how fucked up that looked?

600
02:32:28,870 --> 02:32:37,290
Gotta get the fuck out of here. Gotta get the fuck out of here. I gotta get the fuck out of here.

601
02:32:38,250 --> 02:32:59,139
No, don't go back. No, they're still fucking up my ass. Yeah, they're right on my ass.

602
02:33:08,170 --> 02:33:30,899
Yeah, it's still behind me. Go, go, go, go, go. Keep regetting. Give me that health.

603
02:33:34,819 --> 02:33:48,569
Oh, where is he? Sir, can I have my save file? I beat this game when I was six. I need to take

604
02:33:48,569 --> 02:33:54,329
one final damage the whole entire video. Okay. Oh, I'm not sure how you can do this. Something

605
02:33:54,329 --> 02:33:58,969
must be wrong with your brain. Your brain is not correctly wired or something. I don't know.

606
02:33:58,969 --> 02:34:17,639
We'll be back in an hour to see if you beat this mission. All right, give me something to throw.

607
02:34:32,250 --> 02:34:39,450
There's no way. There's no way. You would die five times to that without even the amount of

608
02:34:39,450 --> 02:35:20,540
running that I'm doing. This is not even the Incredible Hulk. It's so fucking funny.

609
02:35:23,020 --> 02:35:27,100
So how do you want me to? All right. All you got. How do you want me to do this one?

610
02:35:28,459 --> 02:35:33,100
What move do I need to get to throw these guys? What move do I need to get to throw these guys?

611
02:35:36,549 --> 02:35:44,540
All right. Thankfully, we don't have to do that whole thing again. Oh, that's fucking funny.

612
02:35:45,180 --> 02:35:55,559
This is very funny. Okay. Stop throwing. All right. I know you're fucking kidding,

613
02:35:55,559 --> 02:36:02,920
but imagine thinking at the extreme, extreme. I was trying to keep myself alive. Imagine thinking

614
02:36:02,920 --> 02:36:09,500
the guy is throwing, but I was, I was trying so hard to not take it. Did I get a hit?

615
02:36:09,500 --> 02:36:24,120
Thank you. What would throwing look like? Oh, that's funny. No, they're talking about

616
02:36:24,920 --> 02:36:58,069
stop throwing stuff. Oh, all right. Let's go, Tony. I disagree. Throwing is pretty good.

617
02:36:58,950 --> 02:37:11,750
Stay in the realm of possibility of don't. I'm going to, I'm going to skate through this first

618
02:37:11,750 --> 02:37:26,969
part. Here it is. Take this guy out first. Do not move until this guy is dead. Take out the little

619
02:37:26,969 --> 02:38:12,969
guys first. Okay. Give me one of those. Yeah. All right. I'm going to ram them.

620
02:38:17,260 --> 02:38:34,010
Fuck. Grab me. Oh no. Reinforcements came in. That's bad. That help. Give me it right there.

621
02:38:34,010 --> 02:39:01,239
There's two. Fuck the other ones here. I want to explode. Get the fuck out of here. Good.

622
02:39:01,879 --> 02:39:23,690
Another one dead. Good. Oh, I'm ready. Let's go skate. All right. There's another big one here.

623
02:39:23,690 --> 02:39:41,750
He's not aggroing 20 enemies. Pog. I know. I know, but use the critical mass. Don't worry.

624
02:39:41,750 --> 02:40:08,819
I'm saving it for right now. Critical mass on the building. Do it. Yeah. Yeah.

625
02:40:15,909 --> 02:40:35,340
Is it magnificent? How has there been 4,922 viewers here for the last hour straight?

626
02:40:36,139 --> 02:40:51,799
That seems strange. Oh, okay. Destroy the armory and destroy all

627
02:40:52,360 --> 02:41:12,840
unclusters. You can't look away. It's like watching a disaster.

628
02:41:13,639 --> 02:41:33,959
Magnificent. Nice uppercut. I'm sorry. Is somebody shooting me from over here? I couldn't tell.

629
02:41:35,000 --> 02:42:15,450
Not a bad idea. Except you're dead. Magnificent. And butt. And butt. And butt.

630
02:42:18,379 --> 02:42:25,340
Uh, Mick Muscles. Thanks for the 10 community subs, Mick Muscles. That's a 10 drop. 10

631
02:42:25,340 --> 02:42:32,729
community subs. Thanks a lot. Congratulations to those who got those fucking community subs.

632
02:42:33,610 --> 02:42:58,500
Hulk in the chat. Critical mass. All right. Now we take on the big guys. Hulk actually in chat.

633
02:43:00,299 --> 02:43:18,500
Maybe. Don't. Don't call him out. Let him just watch. Here, watch this one. We'll do a

634
02:43:18,500 --> 02:43:24,280
simple little technique here it's called. Get grabbed and get thrown. I'll give you a fucking

635
02:43:24,280 --> 02:43:46,360
technique. What's that? Okay, that's a street light. I thought it was like a jet. Good. All right,

636
02:43:46,360 --> 02:43:51,319
they're both dead, right? Yep. All right, keep going. I want more, uh, I want my shield back.

637
02:43:51,959 --> 02:44:23,000
Let's go. Here we go. Ah. Fun move to do. Give me those fists. Where the fuck are the jukes?

638
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:47,860
Where are the jukes? They're all, they're everywhere, man. Nope. Don't think so. Right

639
02:44:47,860 --> 02:44:50,899
into my hands. Right into my hands. Right into my hands. Right into my hands. Throw them in the

640
02:44:50,899 --> 02:45:04,809
fucking ocean. Oh, you have another DDT. Or a bulldog. You find yourself unable to cast sus.

641
02:45:04,809 --> 02:45:23,479
The screen is live. Yes, it is. Apparently it is. Yeah, it is. I love doing the fadeaway.

642
02:45:24,040 --> 02:45:29,420
You know, when I used to play basketball games, if I played an NBA game, I would, it didn't matter

643
02:45:29,420 --> 02:45:34,059
if the shot was very easy. I would always jump backwards and fade away and shoot every single

644
02:45:34,059 --> 02:45:49,139
time. It just was so satisfying. Everything about it. All right, here we go. Here's the building.

645
02:45:55,110 --> 02:46:01,270
Holy shit. I thought the objects in the mirror are way huger than they appear in front of you.

646
02:46:01,270 --> 02:46:05,190
What? I thought these are small. I thought they were the little ones. It's two huge ones.

647
02:46:11,639 --> 02:46:42,790
Get it. I got it. Shit. You got a fire. That's just annoying. Wouldn't that be hurting me?

648
02:46:43,750 --> 02:46:48,629
Wait, wait, wait. Frank, stop. Frank, stop attacking. He's hitting his fucking head into the metal

649
02:46:48,629 --> 02:47:06,059
over and over again. He's just gonna die. Let him do it. All right, this is bad. I gotta run.

650
02:47:06,940 --> 02:47:41,139
Yeah, I should have ran. I'm regenerating. That's a good thing because I can get help from you.

651
02:47:42,020 --> 02:48:02,100
All right, here we go. Fight. I need that. I need that. I need that. I need that.

652
02:48:03,139 --> 02:48:32,920
I can't go back there. What's even happening? I have no idea. It's almost impossible to tell.

653
02:48:33,559 --> 02:48:37,799
It's 75% of the fights in this game. What is even happening on the screen?

654
02:48:38,520 --> 02:49:00,739
I'm there with you. I have no idea. Where the fuck am I? It's because I have to keep running away

655
02:49:00,739 --> 02:49:12,120
and I keep grabbing more of these fucking guys. Now it's like I can't beat it now.

656
02:49:13,530 --> 02:49:29,829
There's like 30 people following me. I need to regenerate health. Kill one of these guys.

657
02:49:31,930 --> 02:49:34,809
I can't even grab anything because they keep blowing it up before I can get it.

658
02:49:35,610 --> 02:50:07,459
Go for the objective. They'll never stop fucking following me. He's gonna drop health.

659
02:50:17,180 --> 02:50:20,860
Guys, I have to destroy the building and there's 10 people following me.

660
02:50:21,500 --> 02:50:32,860
Running away makes you run into more guys. Yeah, so the two huge guys that were attacking me that

661
02:50:32,860 --> 02:50:37,989
I couldn't kill. Just let them kill me on the bridge or try to fight for my goddamn life.

662
02:50:38,790 --> 02:50:41,780
Should I just let them kill me on the bridge?

663
02:51:04,309 --> 02:51:10,229
Can I buy something new? Yeah, I definitely can buy. I'm gonna get the health upgrade.

664
02:51:11,350 --> 02:51:22,229
And also, it's kind of hard to tell what direction I'm even facing.

665
02:51:22,229 --> 02:51:25,030
It's like, dude, why are you running away? I'm not even trying to. It's just

666
02:51:26,840 --> 02:51:38,170
the game is flashing my life before my eyes. It's like if in Overwatch everybody's four moves

667
02:51:38,170 --> 02:52:23,430
they had were all ultimates. Oh, itchy eye. Where's my tracer? Wait, did they make a tracer pop?

668
02:52:24,149 --> 02:52:50,340
They did. But why don't I have one? Don't aggro anybody. All right, what's the... Oh my god.

669
02:52:50,340 --> 02:52:55,750
I need to get like those dumb checkpoints too. I'm just gonna fly above the city.

670
02:52:56,969 --> 02:53:00,649
I'm not gonna aggro anybody. I'm just gonna fly above. I'm gonna hide.

671
02:53:01,290 --> 02:53:09,450
I'm gonna do sneaking from the top. So just sneak. Nobody will see me. See? No one's even

672
02:53:09,450 --> 02:53:13,690
spawning. I'm breaking the game's spawn rate. Nothing can spawn up here because the game

673
02:53:14,250 --> 02:53:18,969
prioritizes frame rate, right? So if it spawned a shitload of things right now, the game would break.

674
02:53:19,930 --> 02:53:59,129
See? I land for a second and there's a guy right there. I don't know. Dead and dead. Okay, here we go.

675
02:53:59,930 --> 02:54:09,799
And I just beat the shit out of these two guys. Should I race to the objective? Should I try to

676
02:54:09,799 --> 02:54:38,299
spy cap this? All right, I'm gonna try. I'm gonna spy cap this mission. I land. Let's do it twice.

677
02:54:39,100 --> 02:55:32,139
Do it again. It just fucking happened. Third one too. All right, let's help right there.

678
02:55:32,780 --> 02:56:04,459
I might even have water in the game. God damn it. Don't aggro the other guy. I'm trying not to.

679
02:56:05,100 --> 02:56:16,420
Are they smart enough? I'm gonna get the fuck... I'm gonna aggro the other guy, aren't I?

680
02:56:19,350 --> 02:56:40,299
Do a move. Okay, stay back here. Just, I gotta be careful. Don't go the other way. Go the other way.

681
02:56:40,299 --> 02:56:48,899
Watch this. Don't aggro anybody. Check this out. Oh, you fucking piece of shit. Give me a break.

682
02:56:49,700 --> 02:57:15,510
It's gonna work. I got another guy here too. What the fuck? Does this guy even come from there?

683
02:57:15,510 --> 02:57:22,229
What the fuck? There's no like, there's no strategy here. There's no fucking strategy.

684
02:57:32,840 --> 02:57:47,159
It's just, it's just a mess. I have to buy the health upgrade. This is no way.

685
02:57:47,399 --> 02:57:58,040
Unfortunately, we have to do that whole stupid goddamn mission again. But we'll have more health

686
02:57:58,040 --> 02:58:20,659
when we do it. Well, I can assure you. Where is it? Okay. Thank you. Thanks for the health.

687
02:58:21,399 --> 02:58:28,979
Double air dash. This is very fucking important too. Got that one. Okay, let's go. Just ignore

688
02:58:28,979 --> 02:58:53,530
the bridge. Yeah, but I have to kill all the hulk busters. I have to kill the hulk. That's part of

689
02:58:54,489 --> 02:59:16,680
the mission. Part of the mission is destroy all hulk busters. Dashing twice will probably help

690
02:59:16,680 --> 02:59:55,000
a lot. The second one doesn't feel as powerful. Do I like this game? Yeah, I do. It's Caffa Faces.

691
02:59:55,559 --> 02:59:59,719
No, I do. I do like this game. I do. Otherwise, I wouldn't be playing it two days in a row.

692
03:00:06,420 --> 03:00:23,239
You're doing well, Bruce. Okay, let's try this again. More health. Get the jump checkpoint.

693
03:00:24,200 --> 03:00:42,389
Oh, fuck. It's okay. Seven out of ten. Where's the jump point? Somebody spread it. All right.

694
03:00:42,389 --> 03:00:47,690
Let's try this. I'm going for it. I'm going to try as hard as I can. All right. Quiet time.

695
03:00:48,409 --> 03:01:47,159
Trying to be quiet. It's time to not talk about how much I hate this game. Okay. How the fuck are

696
03:01:47,159 --> 03:02:05,139
these missing? Be aggressive. That's all you can do. I'm just spamming. I'm not like you. Well,

697
03:02:05,139 --> 03:02:17,819
let me tactically think about this. I'm the Incredible Hulk. Let me play my chess. I'm

698
03:02:17,819 --> 03:02:19,819
supposed to be quiet. I'm supposed to be quiet. I'm supposed to be quiet. I'm supposed to be

699
03:02:19,819 --> 03:03:03,530
very quiet. Yeah, you walked right into it. Stupid. Here we go. Go. More aggressive. More

700
03:03:03,530 --> 03:03:13,799
aggressive. Be more aggressive. I think the GameCube version had better frame rate.

701
03:03:17,299 --> 03:03:23,299
It is? I have a feeling every game, every one of these had probably bad frame rate.

702
03:03:24,020 --> 03:03:33,930
It's kind of hard to have a good frame rate when there's all this shit going on.

703
03:03:33,930 --> 03:03:52,540
Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? Fuck out of here. Let's go. It's because you're on 723.

704
03:03:52,540 --> 03:04:02,549
Turn it down to 480i. I don't think I can handle that. I don't think I really could do that.

705
03:04:03,190 --> 03:04:53,129
Pretend you're fighting Chad. Okay. Fuck you. Ow. Hey. Ouch. You're hurting me. Ouch. You're

706
03:04:53,129 --> 03:05:19,989
hurting me. Ow. Ow. Stop. That hurt? Bits. Come on, Chad. Kick his ass. Come on. Let's go.

707
03:05:42,120 --> 03:06:31,290
Get off me. Why do they keep spawning? Aggravating. Here we go. It's the first

708
03:06:31,290 --> 03:06:56,309
hunk buster. Get down here. Ask and you shall receive, Jeremy. These guys are so hard to deal

709
03:06:56,309 --> 03:07:03,700
with. Especially when there's all these other little shits just fucking spamming around you

710
03:07:04,020 --> 03:07:19,850
in circles. Throw shit at them? Oh, I would love to. If it wasn't this shit just spamming

711
03:07:19,850 --> 03:07:32,200
in every direction. You're fighting a raid boss. But I am a raid boss too. I can't use that.

712
03:07:46,840 --> 03:07:50,040
They really liked the missiles. When they were making this game, they were like, you know what?

713
03:07:50,040 --> 03:07:54,920
The missiles are the best part of the whole game. Just do more of those. More of those.

714
03:07:55,879 --> 03:08:06,969
Excuse me, guys. I'm not seeing at least 50 missiles every one minute on screen.

715
03:08:07,370 --> 03:08:28,540
What do you think this is? How are we supposed to determine if Hulk is powerful if he doesn't

716
03:08:28,540 --> 03:08:34,540
get hit with fucking 100 long range missiles every second? People won't even know he's powerful.

717
03:08:34,540 --> 03:09:05,690
They won't even know he's strong. He's mad. Here comes another one. Let's go. Hulk is stupid,

718
03:09:05,690 --> 03:09:17,930
but he's strong. That's all right. He adds a lot to the Avengers. He added a shitload to

719
03:09:17,930 --> 03:09:21,850
the Avengers. He was like, he was not even the strongest Avenger, but all right.

720
03:09:22,569 --> 03:09:28,010
Not the smartest Avenger, but okay. Not the coolest powers of all the Avengers. Oh, all right.

721
03:09:29,049 --> 03:09:59,159
It's green. All right. I'm ready for it. Let's go. Angry, angry, angry.

722
03:09:59,959 --> 03:10:21,290
Go get me down. Did you grab me after the buzzer? That's a bunch of penalties. That's fine. Do it.

723
03:10:21,850 --> 03:10:24,569
When the match is over, I will win because you're going to get a shitload of penalties.

724
03:10:24,569 --> 03:10:29,860
You're going to get disqualified. Ref, I'm not doing anything. Ref, I'm not doing

725
03:10:29,860 --> 03:10:50,219
shit. Thank you. All right. This is where I got left off before. This is important. This is the

726
03:10:50,219 --> 03:11:07,930
one. This is the important mission. Just flatten me. These guys are really susceptible to the

727
03:11:07,930 --> 03:11:18,489
fucking flattening. They really are. Just get a shield and then just hit Y and flatten. Over

728
03:11:18,489 --> 03:11:38,889
and over again. Just got me. Yeah, but that just got me. How did you write that? If you write that,

729
03:11:38,889 --> 03:11:54,969
that means I have to say it. What did you say that for? Did you take it out of my hands? What

730
03:11:55,129 --> 03:12:18,100
has happened to that thing? Oh, shit. Oh, but that just got me. Folks, right now.

731
03:12:19,379 --> 03:12:26,329
No, why are you doing this? We may need to do emergency surgery in the studio.

732
03:12:27,610 --> 03:13:11,659
I don't want to do these things. Let me grab me. Thanks. All right. We're almost there. So the

733
03:13:11,659 --> 03:13:18,219
strategy is to go across the water. No, there is no go across the water. There's no go across

734
03:13:18,780 --> 03:13:23,420
guys. Look, destroy all Hulk busters. They have to die. They have to die.

735
03:13:23,420 --> 03:13:47,579
I'm giving up free trailers. I just put that on my expenses and put that on my expenses.

736
03:13:47,579 --> 03:13:52,700
I'll put that on my expenses. I'll put that on my expenses. I'll put that on my expenses.

737
03:14:03,719 --> 03:14:24,069
All right. I can fucking take them to the ground. That went much cleaner. Here we go. Let's try this

738
03:14:24,069 --> 03:14:46,020
tactic. No, wait, don't worry. This is an invisible wall. Staff are asking for a raise.

739
03:14:46,659 --> 03:15:15,700
It's an invisible wall. Why wouldn't there be an invisible wall? Hi. Flat. Flat. Now we just have

740
03:15:15,700 --> 03:15:31,799
to kill two huge guys at the same time. One of your staff just died. Guy just got destroyed. Good.

741
03:15:31,799 --> 03:15:40,540
Okay. Here we go. I have to win. I've got to win. I've got to kill both these guys at the same time.

742
03:15:40,540 --> 03:15:53,430
I've got two stomps. Don't waste critical mass. How should I be using it? Critical atomic slam.

743
03:15:54,149 --> 03:16:17,590
Dan, do I have any other moves I can use it? That's the only move I can do with critical mass,

744
03:16:17,590 --> 03:16:49,020
right? Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Fuck. I'm trying to grab.

745
03:16:49,739 --> 03:17:10,389
Grab one at least. Grab one at least. Get him. It actually kind of is. How the fuck do you fight

746
03:17:10,389 --> 03:17:52,620
these two guys at the same fucking time? Flat. That's not working. Flat don't work. Where the

747
03:17:52,620 --> 03:18:06,840
fuck did you come from? Actually, I need you. Come here. I need his help. I need your help.

748
03:18:12,280 --> 03:18:27,940
They flattened you. Yes, they do. I almost got one. One's almost done. One's dead. One's dead. I got

749
03:18:27,940 --> 03:18:55,479
one. Why are you not dead? Don't jump. Xbox turn off. What are you trying to get? That's not going

750
03:18:55,479 --> 03:19:24,469
to work. Xbox turn off. Xbox go to sleep. That was stupid. Elbow drops to the fucking wind. There

751
03:19:24,469 --> 03:19:31,319
it is. All right. Dead. Finally. Oh my God. I'm just getting so mad. I'm just getting so angry.

752
03:19:31,319 --> 03:20:07,459
I'm just so pissed off. Destroy the armory. All right. It's time for a critical mass. Wait,

753
03:20:07,459 --> 03:20:10,979
let me do the punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch,

754
03:20:10,979 --> 03:20:27,989
punch, punch, punch, punch. Is there any more to do? That was a long, horrible mission. I don't want

755
03:20:27,989 --> 03:20:38,950
to do that one again. How can I say that again? Out of this video. Ultimate destruction. I don't

756
03:20:38,950 --> 03:20:44,170
want to do that one again. I'm a freak show. Sometimes you got to do what's necessary.

757
03:20:44,729 --> 03:20:52,379
Mutation doesn't have to be a curse. Yes. Yes. It can be a blessing if I choose it to be.

758
03:20:53,340 --> 03:21:05,450
You're addicted to the power. You're becoming an abomination. What did you say? It's not like

759
03:21:05,450 --> 03:21:12,250
that. I promise. Now I'm going to use that name. I'm not afraid of the mutation anymore.

760
03:21:12,250 --> 03:21:23,739
This kind of power. Turned on his voice changer. He's streaming right now and people think it's

761
03:21:23,739 --> 03:21:44,360
funny when he does the bugleberry. Is there a jump pod over here somewhere? There probably is.

762
03:21:44,760 --> 03:22:00,629
Oh, we all know. We all know you can do very good. I need to probably jump here.

763
03:22:01,350 --> 03:22:17,459
The next mission is the final mission. What is it actually? No, it's not.

764
03:22:19,340 --> 03:22:42,170
We haven't even fought abomination. Where's a jump pod? I'm so sick of you fucking guys.

765
03:22:43,129 --> 03:22:47,959
Follow me the fuck around everywhere I go.

766
03:22:47,959 --> 03:23:01,020
Do you just leave me the fuck alone ever? Or do I have to constantly fucking constantly just be

767
03:23:01,659 --> 03:23:10,870
running the fuck away from you? Just leave me alone. Why is the aggra range infinite on these

768
03:23:10,870 --> 03:23:23,030
guys? It shouldn't be like that. Shouldn't be like that. Yeah. F, F, F, F. That was a real F.

769
03:23:23,989 --> 03:23:44,489
Oh, that was a real one. Oh, it was a real one. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. No, don't worry. It's perfectly

770
03:23:44,489 --> 03:23:51,129
normal. Perfectly normal. That's perfectly fine. That's completely normal. I'll tell you what.

771
03:23:52,329 --> 03:23:57,530
That might be freaking out about 300. As you know, on a typical stream,

772
03:23:58,489 --> 03:24:04,649
uh, a typical stream that's between four to seven, like five to six hours long,

773
03:24:05,290 --> 03:24:09,450
drops about a thousand frames, maybe like 600 to a thousand. That's pretty typical.

774
03:24:09,450 --> 03:24:12,809
But also keep this in mind as well. I'm also streaming through a VPN,

775
03:24:13,610 --> 03:24:18,489
so I'm not getting the full power of the fiber because I'm going through a VPN.

776
03:24:19,690 --> 03:24:28,379
Why am I doing that? Because I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm whack as I want to.

777
03:24:30,340 --> 03:24:34,899
No, it is not the one. It's not that one. It's not that one. Okay. I can be, it's not that one.

778
03:24:37,579 --> 03:24:50,860
I don't know what this is. I don't just want to die. What are you talking about? Well, uh,

779
03:24:50,860 --> 03:25:00,329
don't act like I didn't buy a service and pay for the year four months ago or so and, uh, moved and

780
03:25:00,329 --> 03:25:05,290
don't need it anymore. We don't think I'm going to get my money's worth and continue to use though,

781
03:25:05,370 --> 03:25:09,610
that, that the, the privacy and the potential routing of a VPN provider.

782
03:25:10,329 --> 03:25:28,940
I'm gonna let this thing run out. Critical thunderclap. I feel like, wait,

783
03:25:28,940 --> 03:25:40,389
are there any important moves? Critical pain. It lives a huge deal of damage to a single foe.

784
03:25:41,590 --> 03:25:55,079
Critical pain. What is it? Max X and then, hold on, how do you press that on Xbox with your

785
03:25:55,079 --> 03:26:00,840
Max X plus B. I have to hold it like my thumb and finger. That's kind of a weird combo to press.

786
03:26:02,040 --> 03:26:18,709
Anything else? I can't air spike. I'll think I saved the points.

787
03:26:21,219 --> 03:26:35,979
Good for the big guys. Yeah. No, I, yeah, I'm still streaming through VPN. So I've lost literally

788
03:26:35,979 --> 03:26:43,260
anything less than a thousand for a full stream is that's normal. Cause nothing can ever be

789
03:26:43,260 --> 03:26:54,020
perfect. No matter how good or how fast or how stable something is in that back when there was

790
03:26:54,020 --> 03:27:01,270
no internet problems at all. I mean, you typically will always drop like at least a few hundred frames

791
03:27:01,270 --> 03:27:10,219
stream. That's not, I'm not, don't worry. I'm not alarmed by that. We're losing our few remaining

792
03:27:10,219 --> 03:27:15,739
chances. Our contact in the division has left classified material for me in a box at the army

793
03:27:15,739 --> 03:27:20,299
testing facility. I don't get it. Why they're praising like fiber was the second coming of

794
03:27:20,299 --> 03:27:32,440
Christ. Well, yes, because, um, this fiber line is a 1000, 1000 line or 400% less than what I was

795
03:27:32,440 --> 03:27:46,899
paying for a 330 line at the old place. So yeah, I am going to talk about it like that as cable sucks.

796
03:27:47,700 --> 03:28:02,760
This is Len. I need you to listen to me. I can't protect you anymore. We've lost control.

797
03:28:02,760 --> 03:28:07,799
Both of us. If you don't let me help you, you'll destroy yourself and the rest of us in the process.

798
03:28:07,799 --> 03:28:11,799
Actually very, very true statement. I don't like what you're saying. I don't grow a car.

799
03:28:15,500 --> 03:28:22,440
Oh, it's bad. Looks like worse than a super villain. Okay. How many people has the Joker killed?

800
03:28:22,440 --> 03:28:31,340
Oh, like what? Like less than 20 just today. The Hulk has killed like 5,000 fucking people.

801
03:28:32,059 --> 03:28:42,149
I'm talking only today. All right. This is the frame rate boss.

802
03:28:52,600 --> 03:29:26,309
Grab him. I got to get like up on his head. Grab him. The army's doing damage. Yeah, I know.

803
03:29:31,639 --> 03:29:47,100
Oh, I think I lose. I need to retry this one. I'm going to be here for a long time.

804
03:29:47,819 --> 03:30:09,129
I'm going to be here for a very, very long time. What did he say? What? What did he say?

805
03:30:10,170 --> 03:30:14,100
What did he just say? What do you mean? I wasn't even paying attention.

806
03:30:15,059 --> 03:30:24,090
He said mop up. I'm done here. Right? Like I'm done. What are you talking about? Hold on.

807
03:30:24,729 --> 03:31:02,379
Let me hear that again. What do you, what do you, when the Hulk is confined by a special attack,

808
03:31:02,379 --> 03:31:10,680
he can struggle. Yes. Okay. All right. Kill me. I want to hear what you guys are talking about.

809
03:31:58,680 --> 03:32:07,219
Come and mop up. Now I'm not going to be able to unhear that for the next 30 times I die to this

810
03:32:07,219 --> 03:32:37,190
guy. All right. Stupid. All right. Launch a missile. Incoming missile. That's not a missile. I want

811
03:32:37,190 --> 03:32:45,290
you to do a missile. Doink. Tell me again to grab missiles and throw them back. I'd love to hear

812
03:32:45,290 --> 03:32:49,450
you tell me about it. Tell me. Yell at me. You should be grabbing missiles. Grab the missile.

813
03:32:51,610 --> 03:33:49,059
You got one. Where's that tank? Where are you? Wait. I died. This is going to be hard. It's not

814
03:33:49,059 --> 03:33:55,700
that. It's come, it's coming mop up boys. Coming mop up boys. Coming mop up boys.

815
03:33:56,340 --> 03:34:04,340
Yeah. Coming mop up boys. Coming mop up boys. Coming mop up boys. See it's coming mop up boys.

816
03:34:05,299 --> 03:34:28,180
It's that's what he's saying. That's what he's saying. Why would I do that? I was trying to like

817
03:34:28,180 --> 03:34:33,620
prove to you guys. What am I proving to you? You already know what it is. This guy's impossible.

818
03:34:34,579 --> 03:35:11,110
Can I just do an elbow drop? Can I just run? Run. Oh it fell. I don't even know what the strategy is.

819
03:35:12,389 --> 03:35:22,700
What am I talking about? There is no strategy. I have to take down four, five health bars with this.

820
03:35:23,260 --> 03:36:01,190
Grab his foot. Tanks at him. Yeah but I have to stand still for the tanks and I'm gonna get hit

821
03:36:01,190 --> 03:36:54,659
by everything. Like I'm, I'm already dead. I'm gonna try to throw tanks at him. Or is there a tank?

822
03:36:58,659 --> 03:37:09,770
Can I just get a shield for the time being until a tank shows up? I mean what are you doing?

823
03:37:11,209 --> 03:37:25,940
Okay here comes some tanks. All right let's go. I'm gonna grab one. See this is what I'm talking

824
03:37:25,940 --> 03:37:36,840
about. Me throwing this tank I'm getting just killed. Did we throw it? Holy shit that was a lot

825
03:37:36,840 --> 03:38:29,690
of damage. But I need you over here. Come here. No get this out of here. Attack him. Him.

826
03:38:42,459 --> 03:38:49,579
Junior. Are you watching the movie with your dad? Like he's really hyperactive right now.

827
03:38:51,420 --> 03:38:57,180
Dad's just fucking sick of his shit. Junior sit down. I'm trying to fucking enjoy the Hulk. Ultimate

828
03:38:57,180 --> 03:39:23,590
fucking missiles on screen. That mist. Dad's reading a newspaper. Dad's not even watching

829
03:39:23,590 --> 03:39:29,739
the movie. He just doesn't want uh little Timmy to be jumping around excited about the Hulk.

830
03:39:29,739 --> 03:39:47,659
God. Okay I got the right strategy but I have to stay alive. Yeah I I ain't gonna show that on

831
03:39:47,659 --> 03:39:56,600
screen. Uh I'm not gonna put that image on screen. But you are free to um to look at it on your own

832
03:39:56,600 --> 03:40:02,120
time if you feel like it. You can do that if you feel like it. You can just on your own time. You

833
03:40:02,120 --> 03:40:06,120
can look at whatever image you want as long as. It's nothing to do with me. Literally nothing to do

834
03:40:06,120 --> 03:40:29,829
with me. Has nothing to do with me. I'm just gonna get away. Yes I do. Just run. No dad.

835
03:40:46,819 --> 03:40:56,729
There's the first tank. Oh nervous. I used that one already today. I used that one already. Oh

03:40:56,729 --> 03:41:01,129
nervous. Oh scared and oh I tried to. I already did that one today.

03:41:01,850 --> 03:41:22,309
I'm gonna do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again.

838
03:41:22,309 --> 03:41:26,950
Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again.

839
03:41:26,950 --> 03:42:13,899
Look at what I was doing. What's this bullshit? Tank. Tank. Land so I can punch you. Okay we're

03:42:32,469 --> 03:43:01,030
Destroy this whole entire place. Safe going up. There he is. Wait the energy meet me.

All right let's get him. Here is another tank. And shut up. Oh banner. Banner what the heck man.

Do it. Oh she's alive. Oh I need a tank. I need a tank right now. Right now. Come here.

03:44:31,260 --> 03:44:35,670
That's it.

845
03:45:02,180 --> 03:45:08,870
You spray paint your hair green to mock me.

846
03:45:32,540 --> 03:45:45,750
Oh no. Is it hypnotism word? That's all we had to do. Can I buy anything?

03:46:47,340 --> 03:47:06,520
Critical mass surge level two. Buy the missile pack.

851
03:47:08,440 --> 03:47:13,719
Follow Blonsky and escape from the vault. Defeat the capture ward and smash your way through the

852
03:47:13,719 --> 03:47:23,850
vault defenses and leap to freedom. All right. You can't just open his mind. It's like trying

853
03:47:23,850 --> 03:47:30,579
to peel an onion with a chainsaw. You promised me he'd have the best of care. I said to the

854
03:47:30,579 --> 03:47:36,340
best of my ability. It's out of my hands now. Wait I've been in VR this whole time haven't I?

855
03:47:36,340 --> 03:47:43,180
Oh you can't just open his mind.

856
03:48:09,510 --> 03:48:14,149
Tough you are to the nearest decimal point. I don't need to know how to become

857
03:48:14,149 --> 03:48:26,500
like you. I need to know how to control it. Voice what are you? I'm Ahab. I know you get angry. It

858
03:48:26,500 --> 03:48:32,420
makes you big green. We'll make sure we have so many protocols in place to prevent you from doing

859
03:48:32,420 --> 03:48:47,979
that. Here's funny dog and cat compilation number 412 on YouTube. Here is guilty dog compilation

860
03:48:47,979 --> 03:49:11,079
number six. No way you'll get angry at this. All right let's just stretch it in a little bit.

Text bloodbath 426442. Hey by the way how the fuck does that even work?

866
03:50:59,829 --> 03:51:13,299
It doesn't make any sense. They don't do that anymore. Yeah remember it was like if you want

I'm not what do you mean? Play numbers go up. We're good. We should play stock market simulator.

873
03:52:33,750 --> 03:52:41,530
Is that a real game? Is that a real game? Is that a real game? Is that a real game? Does it follow

03:52:41,530 --> 03:53:13,430

876
03:53:29,459 --> 03:53:43,430
Seriously what's the timing on that shit? He just exploded himself. Haha Shrek wins again.

877
03:53:44,149 --> 03:54:30,780
Is there a reason why we're hunting? What is this for? What is this for? Watch it. No the grab moves are so dumb.

Nobody even did a move there.

881
03:55:38,860 --> 03:55:40,860
We were both trying to throw at the same time.

882
03:55:40,860 --> 03:55:42,860
We both have money on ourselves losing.

883
03:55:42,860 --> 03:56:00,780
We both have money on ourselves losing.

884
03:56:00,780 --> 03:56:05,879
For a Jerma Rumble?

885
03:56:05,879 --> 03:56:08,889
Hmm. That's a thought.

886
03:56:08,889 --> 03:56:10,889
Yeah, it's just a big green guy.

887
03:56:10,889 --> 03:56:12,889
We take very much development.

888
03:56:12,889 --> 03:56:38,659
Quack quack quack quack quack quack.

889
03:56:38,659 --> 03:56:40,659
What do we call ourselves? The Jerma Crew?

890
03:56:40,659 --> 03:57:09,139
Yeah.

891
03:57:09,139 --> 03:57:11,139
Sure.

892
03:57:11,139 --> 03:57:13,379
Whatever you say, game.

893
03:57:13,379 --> 03:57:18,440
No, just glue your hand to my head and kill me?

894
03:57:18,440 --> 03:57:20,440
No, just glue your hand to my head and kill me?

895
03:57:20,440 --> 03:57:24,020
Oh, did you have to do it?

896
03:57:24,020 --> 03:57:30,659
Oh, okay.

897
03:57:30,659 --> 03:57:50,700
Fuck.

898
03:57:50,700 --> 03:57:57,989
We have to fight in this little fucking corridor.

899
03:57:57,989 --> 03:57:59,989
We have to fight in this little fucking corridor.

900
03:57:59,989 --> 03:58:01,989
No, now you can't get in here, the gate's closed.

901
03:58:01,989 --> 03:58:05,700
Fuck off.

902
03:58:05,700 --> 03:58:27,129
Now I fight the huge guy.

903
03:58:27,129 --> 03:58:29,129
I need to throw explosives at him.

904
03:58:29,129 --> 03:58:31,129
Don't let him blow these barrels up, they're very important.

905
03:58:31,129 --> 03:58:49,180
Just throw fucking, just throw dice in the air.

906
03:58:49,180 --> 03:58:51,180
Just throw fucking, just throw dice in the air.

907
03:58:51,180 --> 03:58:53,180
Whatever lands.

908
03:58:53,180 --> 03:59:03,159
That's what happens.

909
03:59:03,159 --> 03:59:29,399
D&D Hulk.

910
03:59:29,399 --> 03:59:38,549
I grabbed one.

911
03:59:38,549 --> 03:59:41,239
He's sure he's not pretending.

912
03:59:41,239 --> 03:59:43,239
I'm pretty sure he is.

913
03:59:43,239 --> 04:00:12,219
He has to be.

914
04:00:12,219 --> 04:00:14,219
And he grabbed me during that

915
04:00:14,219 --> 04:00:25,610
attack and stopped running and throwing.

916
04:00:25,610 --> 04:00:27,610
But I'm gonna get grabbed and half my health disappears.

917
04:00:27,610 --> 04:00:29,610
Every enemy in the game has a

918
04:00:29,610 --> 04:00:43,690
You can't just open his

919
04:00:43,690 --> 04:00:45,860
Get away from me, you pile of filth.

920
04:00:45,860 --> 04:00:47,860
Just swing.

921
04:00:47,860 --> 04:00:49,860
What happened in this room?

922
04:00:49,860 --> 04:00:52,100
Did he leave a grenade?

923
04:00:52,100 --> 04:00:54,659
Get away from me, you pile of filth.

924
04:00:54,659 --> 04:00:56,659
Sorry everyone I know in there.

925
04:00:56,659 --> 04:00:58,659
I dropped the grenade and ran out of the fucking room.

926
04:00:58,659 --> 04:01:00,659
I dropped the grenade and ran out of the fucking room.

927
04:01:00,659 --> 04:01:02,659
Speaking of running out of rooms, I'm just running.

928
04:01:02,659 --> 04:01:06,569
Speaking of running out of rooms, I'm just running.

929
04:01:06,569 --> 04:01:08,569
Why even play the video game?

930
04:01:08,569 --> 04:01:43,690
Alright, shut it on him.

931
04:01:43,690 --> 04:01:45,690
Use new moves and what?

932
04:01:45,690 --> 04:01:47,690
You see the fucking insanity

933
04:01:47,690 --> 04:01:49,690
You see the fucking insanity that's going on on the screen?

934
04:01:49,690 --> 04:01:53,020
that's going on on the screen?

935
04:01:53,020 --> 04:01:55,020
X, Y, and then Y, Y, X.

936
04:01:55,020 --> 04:02:04,299
This is not that hard.

937
04:02:04,299 --> 04:02:14,540
I don't have any clubs. I don't have any club moves.

938
04:02:14,540 --> 04:02:22,790
X and Y?

939
04:02:22,790 --> 04:02:28,040
Let's try that.

940
04:02:28,040 --> 04:02:30,040
Punch the missiles back? No, we've already shown how ineffective that actually is.

941
04:02:30,040 --> 04:02:32,040
Punch the missiles back? No, we've already shown how ineffective that actually is.

942
04:02:32,040 --> 04:03:04,040
Get me out of here!

943
04:03:04,040 --> 04:03:23,690
Why can't I just climb out?

944
04:03:23,690 --> 04:03:25,690
Look at us.

945
04:03:25,690 --> 04:03:33,049
What?

946
04:03:33,049 --> 04:03:35,049
Alright, cool, yeah.

947
04:03:35,049 --> 04:03:37,049
I don't know.

948
04:03:37,049 --> 04:03:39,219
Pogs are

949
04:03:39,219 --> 04:03:41,219
Pogs are for dumb idiots.

950
04:03:41,219 --> 04:03:50,569
Pogs are for

951
04:03:50,569 --> 04:03:53,829
Pogs are for your breath smells, I bet.

952
04:03:53,829 --> 04:04:11,110
Pogs are for your breath smells, I bet.

953
04:04:11,110 --> 04:04:13,110
Dude, just X, X, Y, Y,

954
04:04:13,110 --> 04:04:15,110
Dude, just X, X, Y, Y, man. Like Y, Y, X, X.

955
04:04:15,110 --> 04:04:17,110
Dude, just X, X, Y, Y, man. Like Y, Y, X, X. Do you combo on these?

956
04:04:17,110 --> 04:04:21,020
X, X, why are you not doing a combo?

957
04:04:21,020 --> 04:04:27,100
Why, why?

958
04:04:27,100 --> 04:04:53,659
It's just a game?

959
04:04:53,659 --> 04:04:55,659
No, it's the lifestyle.

960
04:04:55,659 --> 04:05:06,520
I am the fucking Hulk.

961
04:05:06,520 --> 04:05:08,520
Don't you understand?

962
04:05:08,520 --> 04:05:18,379
I can't even attack him.

963
04:05:18,379 --> 04:05:20,940
I just have to throw shit at him.

964
04:05:20,940 --> 04:05:22,940
I can't physically fucking swing at him.

965
04:05:22,940 --> 04:05:27,540
I just have to throw shit at him. I can't physically fucking swing at him.

966
04:05:27,540 --> 04:06:02,979
Damn it!

967
04:06:02,979 --> 04:06:19,989
Crusted, I needed that.

968
04:06:19,989 --> 04:06:21,989
Crusted, I needed that.

969
04:06:21,989 --> 04:06:23,989
I just goomba stomped that I needed that so bad.

970
04:06:23,989 --> 04:06:25,989
I just goomba stomped that I needed that so bad.

971
04:06:25,989 --> 04:06:28,360
What happened?

972
04:06:28,360 --> 04:06:39,559
Alright, throw a broken car at him.

973
04:06:39,559 --> 04:06:41,989
Just do your combo.

974
04:06:41,989 --> 04:06:43,989
X, X, Y, Y.

975
04:06:43,989 --> 04:07:02,940
This motherfucker just tripped.

976
04:07:02,940 --> 04:07:07,739
I need a...

977
04:07:07,739 --> 04:07:09,739
Fucking broken down, broke ass car.

978
04:07:09,739 --> 04:07:14,149
Just hit him.

979
04:07:14,149 --> 04:07:16,149
I can't, you can't just punch him.

980
04:07:16,149 --> 04:07:18,899
Eat this shit.

981
04:07:18,899 --> 04:07:21,139
I hit the fucking dumb asshole in front of him.

982
04:07:21,139 --> 04:07:51,540
Is he dead?

983
04:07:51,540 --> 04:07:54,420
Just get the fuck away from me.

984
04:07:54,420 --> 04:08:00,180
Just get the fuck away from me.

985
04:08:00,180 --> 04:08:02,180
This is what it feels like to be a bug in a room full of people.

986
04:08:02,180 --> 04:08:11,020
Where's that mosquito?

987
04:08:11,020 --> 04:08:13,510
There he is, there he is, get him, get him.

988
04:08:13,510 --> 04:08:16,200
Please don't get me.

989
04:08:16,200 --> 04:08:18,200
No, open up a window, let me fly out.

990
04:08:18,200 --> 04:08:29,850
I promise I'll fly out if you just open a fucking window.

991
04:08:29,850 --> 04:08:31,850
Fucking chance, stupid human.

992
04:08:31,850 --> 04:08:33,850
Oh, he killed me.

993
04:08:33,850 --> 04:08:35,850
What was that grab?

994
04:08:35,850 --> 04:08:39,110
No, guys, guys, no.

995
04:08:39,110 --> 04:08:41,110
No, I'm sorry.

996
04:08:41,110 --> 04:08:43,110
I ain't gonna fucking take the blame on this one.

997
04:08:43,110 --> 04:08:45,110
I ain't taking the blame on this one.

998
04:08:45,110 --> 04:08:47,110
I'm not taking the blame on this.

999
04:08:47,110 --> 04:08:49,799
It's like I'm not locked on.

1000
04:08:49,799 --> 04:08:51,799
And who is even attacking who?

1001
04:08:56,020 --> 04:08:58,020
This is, no way.

1002
04:08:58,020 --> 04:09:00,020
You can't even fucking determine.

1003
04:09:00,020 --> 04:09:07,899
Like I said, alright, give me

1004
04:09:07,899 --> 04:09:37,979
some life.

1005
04:09:37,979 --> 04:09:46,299
I did it.

1006
04:09:46,299 --> 04:09:55,059
I did it.

1007
04:09:55,059 --> 04:10:07,420
I just want to see if there were a bunch of people behind

1008
04:10:07,420 --> 04:10:09,420
that door. Oh, no, there's somebody.

1009
04:10:09,420 --> 04:10:11,420
You're coming with me.

1010
04:10:11,420 --> 04:10:30,739
Oh, shit.

1011
04:10:30,739 --> 04:10:34,520
Oh, he found me. He found me.

1012
04:10:34,520 --> 04:10:52,379
He found me.

1013
04:10:52,379 --> 04:10:54,379
Banner, I have the stormtroopers behind you.

1014
04:10:54,379 --> 04:10:58,020
I guess still floating.

1015
04:10:58,020 --> 04:11:00,020
Wait, the guy's floating in the

1016
04:11:00,020 --> 04:11:12,700
jump pad.

1017
04:11:12,700 --> 04:11:15,190
That's kind of a cool move.

1018
04:11:15,190 --> 04:11:20,059
Get explosions on you.

1019
04:11:20,059 --> 04:11:27,930
Escape the vault. Oh, God.

1020
04:11:27,930 --> 04:11:29,930
Escape vault. Escape inner base.

1021
04:11:29,930 --> 04:11:31,930
Escape outer base. Return to the

1022
04:11:31,930 --> 04:11:33,930
church. Great.

1023
04:11:33,930 --> 04:11:44,620
This is gonna be hell.

1024
04:11:44,620 --> 04:11:54,469
Oh, they're

1025
04:11:54,469 --> 04:12:00,170
seriously blocking

1026
04:12:00,170 --> 04:12:02,170
doors.

1027
04:12:02,170 --> 04:12:06,579
Do I have to actually kill everything?

1028
04:12:06,579 --> 04:12:08,579
Alright, where's the tank?

1029
04:12:08,579 --> 04:12:34,739
Where the fuck did they come from?

1030
04:12:34,739 --> 04:12:36,739
Where did all these tanks come from?

1031
04:12:36,739 --> 04:12:41,610
Where did they come from?

1032
04:12:41,610 --> 04:12:50,309
Where are you guys being here?

1033
04:12:50,309 --> 04:12:53,579
Oh, they're coming out of the doors.

1034
04:12:53,579 --> 04:12:55,579
Stand at the door and don't let them come out.

1035
04:12:55,579 --> 04:13:01,780
Can I leave yet?

1036
04:13:01,780 --> 04:13:05,239
Wait, just leave?

1037
04:13:05,239 --> 04:13:07,239
Wait, this is not a force field?

1038
04:13:07,239 --> 04:13:09,239
I can't leave.

1039
04:13:09,239 --> 04:13:11,239
Guys, this is like a force field doing this.

1040
04:13:11,239 --> 04:13:13,239
I can't get out of here. I have to kill everything.

1041
04:13:13,239 --> 04:13:27,049
Can I finally do bowling?

1042
04:13:27,049 --> 04:13:47,719
Yeah, I'm Hulk.

1043
04:13:47,719 --> 04:13:53,479
This is like just Hulk

1044
04:13:53,479 --> 04:13:59,819
bored. Let it go.

1045
04:13:59,819 --> 04:14:02,889
Oh, they're killing each other.

1046
04:14:02,889 --> 04:14:04,889
They're just singing

1047
04:14:04,889 --> 04:14:06,889
in the rain.

1048
04:14:06,889 --> 04:14:09,059
Singing in the rain.

1049
04:14:09,059 --> 04:14:11,059
What a day

1050
04:14:11,059 --> 04:14:13,059
to be around.

1051
04:14:13,059 --> 04:14:16,260
Now fucking die.

1052
04:14:16,260 --> 04:14:23,180
Can I get rid of this?

1053
04:14:23,180 --> 04:14:26,950
Just throw it.

1054
04:14:26,950 --> 04:14:28,950
I don't want this.

1055
04:14:28,950 --> 04:14:40,840
Wait, come here.

1056
04:14:40,840 --> 04:14:42,840
Somebody said throw it through the shield.

1057
04:14:42,840 --> 04:14:45,020
Oh my

1058
04:14:45,020 --> 04:14:47,020
God. What?

1059
04:14:47,020 --> 04:14:49,020
What?

1060
04:14:49,020 --> 04:14:52,979
What the heck?

1061
04:14:52,979 --> 04:14:54,979
I can't walk through the shield,

1062
04:14:54,979 --> 04:14:56,979
but I can throw things through the shield.

1063
04:14:56,979 --> 04:14:58,979
What object am I made out of?

1064
04:14:58,979 --> 04:15:01,989
What is this? A water filter?

1065
04:15:01,989 --> 04:15:03,989
And I'm like the

1066
04:15:03,989 --> 04:15:05,989
thing. This is like the fucking dirt

1067
04:15:05,989 --> 04:15:07,989
that can get through the filter, but not me.

1068
04:15:07,989 --> 04:15:20,389
This is like a...

1069
04:15:20,389 --> 04:15:22,389
I taught you that yesterday. It's been a whole day, man.

1070
04:15:22,389 --> 04:15:34,870
I think I got it.

1071
04:15:34,870 --> 04:15:39,290
Hey, you. Later.

1072
04:15:39,290 --> 04:15:52,729
Are you drunk?

1073
04:15:52,729 --> 04:15:56,120
No, I'm not.

1074
04:15:56,120 --> 04:15:58,120
I am actually not. Sorry to say.

1075
04:15:58,120 --> 04:16:01,379
Although I really

1076
04:16:01,379 --> 04:16:03,379
probably should have a drink.

1077
04:16:03,379 --> 04:16:05,379
Maybe like a

1078
04:16:05,379 --> 04:16:09,219
few days.

1079
04:16:09,219 --> 04:16:11,219
Watch some public domain movies.

1080
04:16:11,219 --> 04:16:13,719
Wednesday.

1081
04:16:13,719 --> 04:16:16,020
Double hit.

1082
04:16:16,020 --> 04:16:24,340
Where's this other one?

1083
04:16:24,340 --> 04:16:32,219
Out of the tower. One more.

1084
04:16:32,219 --> 04:16:41,239
Turn, Hulk. Turn.

1085
04:16:41,239 --> 04:16:43,239
Here's to that. Thanks for

1086
04:16:43,239 --> 04:16:45,239
blowing my shit up.

1087
04:16:45,239 --> 04:16:47,239
Now I can't break it. I need this other one.

1088
04:16:47,239 --> 04:16:49,239
I really cannot hit this.

1089
04:16:49,239 --> 04:17:01,059
Get up there.

1090
04:17:01,059 --> 04:17:03,059
Don't shoot this out of my hands.

1091
04:17:03,059 --> 04:17:05,059
I'll be so mad at you.

1092
04:17:05,059 --> 04:17:22,780
Go. Thank you.

1093
04:17:22,780 --> 04:17:31,909
Try another.

1094
04:17:31,909 --> 04:17:33,909
Oh, you missed that one.

1095
04:17:33,909 --> 04:17:52,010
Drive by the jets.

1096
04:17:52,010 --> 04:18:01,989
I want to ride one.

1097
04:18:01,989 --> 04:18:04,299
That's not how a plane works.

1098
04:18:04,299 --> 04:18:06,299
That's not how planes work.

1099
04:18:06,299 --> 04:18:08,299
This is not...

1100
04:18:08,299 --> 04:18:12,170
They fucking

1101
04:18:12,170 --> 04:18:14,170
It's not

1102
04:18:14,170 --> 04:18:16,729
like a little kid

1103
04:18:16,729 --> 04:18:18,729
putting a little kid in

1104
04:18:18,729 --> 04:18:20,729
this fucking bedroom.

1105
04:18:20,729 --> 04:18:22,729
Plane flies around like this.

1106
04:18:24,729 --> 04:18:30,549
Why is there not a toddler's

1107
04:18:30,549 --> 04:18:32,549
hand on that? Why?

1108
04:18:32,549 --> 04:18:49,059
I need to grab this.

1109
04:18:49,059 --> 04:18:54,700
How do I jump over it?

1110
04:19:16,819 --> 04:19:21,049
Banner.

1111
04:19:21,049 --> 04:19:24,620
Banner. Don't do it

1112
04:19:24,620 --> 04:19:26,620
Banner. Banner.

1113
04:19:26,620 --> 04:19:52,780
Object.

1114
04:19:52,780 --> 04:19:54,780
You're making me fucking

1115
04:19:54,780 --> 04:20:19,219
bald.

1116
04:20:19,219 --> 04:20:21,219
Why would you turn that way?

1117
04:20:21,219 --> 04:20:23,219
I'm trying to aim down here.

1118
04:20:23,219 --> 04:20:25,219
That's so...

1119
04:20:25,219 --> 04:20:29,190
Aim the other

1120
04:20:29,190 --> 04:20:33,739
fucking way.

1121
04:20:33,739 --> 04:20:35,739
What are you doing?

1122
04:20:35,739 --> 04:20:48,340
Of course, here comes a toddler plane.

1123
04:20:48,340 --> 04:21:21,879
Can't wait.

1124
04:21:21,879 --> 04:21:25,079
This really is fucking

1125
04:21:25,079 --> 04:21:27,079
dumb as shit.

1126
04:21:27,079 --> 04:21:48,700
I need to jump over

1127
04:21:48,700 --> 04:21:57,909
the tunnel.

1128
04:21:57,909 --> 04:21:59,909
Let's aim.

1129
04:21:59,909 --> 04:22:01,909
Yes.

1130
04:22:01,909 --> 04:22:03,909
Yes.

1131
04:22:03,909 --> 04:22:05,909
You know all the people that I'm facing?

1132
04:22:05,909 --> 04:22:07,909
You know the people that I'm

1133
04:22:07,909 --> 04:22:09,909
directly facing with my character?

1134
04:22:09,909 --> 04:22:12,540
Target them. Definitely do that.

1135
04:22:12,540 --> 04:22:14,540
Target the people that are behind you.

1136
04:22:14,540 --> 04:22:16,540
This is fun.

1137
04:22:16,540 --> 04:22:58,180
Didn't even work.

1138
04:22:58,180 --> 04:23:01,260
Fire a missile in here.

1139
04:23:01,260 --> 04:23:04,069
Don't come in here.

1140
04:23:04,069 --> 04:23:06,069
All right.

1141
04:23:06,069 --> 04:23:08,069
They did.

1142
04:23:08,069 --> 04:23:11,209
I want that

1143
04:23:11,209 --> 04:23:13,209
targeted, please.

1144
04:23:13,209 --> 04:23:15,209
The thing in front of me.

1145
04:23:15,209 --> 04:23:17,209
The thing in front of me.

1146
04:23:17,209 --> 04:23:19,209
Ultimate Destruction. The thing in front of me.

1147
04:23:19,209 --> 04:23:21,209
It's right in front of you.

1148
04:23:21,209 --> 04:23:23,209
It's right here.

1149
04:23:23,209 --> 04:23:45,930
Oh my god.

1150
04:23:45,930 --> 04:23:47,930
It's a fucking ceiling.

1151
04:23:47,930 --> 04:23:49,930
There's a bunch of junk in the way.

1152
04:23:49,930 --> 04:23:54,219
Shoot at me.

1153
04:23:54,219 --> 04:24:02,969
I dare you.

1154
04:24:02,969 --> 04:24:05,909
What is above me?

1155
04:24:05,909 --> 04:24:39,819
Is it a toddler plane?

1156
04:24:39,819 --> 04:24:50,250
Goodbye. Pick up the truck.

1157
04:24:50,250 --> 04:24:52,420
And attack.

1158
04:24:52,420 --> 04:24:57,610
Three. Two.

1159
04:24:57,610 --> 04:24:59,610
One. Go.

1160
04:25:02,870 --> 04:25:15,739
Where is this tower thing?

1161
04:25:15,739 --> 04:25:23,540
Break the target.

1162
04:25:27,000 --> 04:25:38,139
I don't like gravity.

1163
04:25:38,139 --> 04:25:40,950
I don't like gravity.

1164
04:25:40,950 --> 04:25:43,379
I don't like gravity.

1165
04:25:43,379 --> 04:25:45,379
Movie too long. Too boring.

1166
04:25:45,379 --> 04:26:01,750
Give me this.

1167
04:26:01,750 --> 04:26:09,620
No. Stop.

1168
04:26:09,620 --> 04:26:11,620
He stopped.

1169
04:26:11,620 --> 04:26:14,379
He listened.

1170
04:26:14,379 --> 04:26:17,000
Freeze.

1171
04:26:17,000 --> 04:26:34,780
Return to the church.

1172
04:26:34,780 --> 04:26:36,780
Just do your combo, man.

1173
04:26:36,780 --> 04:26:38,780
Express x, x, y, y, y.

1174
04:26:38,780 --> 04:26:46,950
Okay.

1175
04:27:05,350 --> 04:27:07,350
I don't rage.

1176
04:27:07,350 --> 04:27:11,829
Kindergarten.

1177
04:27:11,829 --> 04:27:14,440
Yeah.

1178
04:27:14,440 --> 04:27:17,059
I don't like that.

1179
04:27:31,399 --> 04:27:33,399
Aww.

1180
04:27:33,399 --> 04:27:38,840
To the devil his due.

1181
04:27:38,840 --> 04:27:42,299
After this cutscene I'm going to go take a break.

1182
04:27:42,299 --> 04:27:44,299
I'm going to get a water and I'm going to take a small pee.

1183
04:28:00,299 --> 04:28:02,299
The devil hulk's going to emerge and there's nothing I can do about it.

1184
04:28:02,299 --> 04:28:04,299
I'm sorry.

1185
04:28:04,299 --> 04:28:06,299
I'm sorry I gave up on you.

1186
04:28:06,299 --> 04:28:08,299
Don't you just want to make the devil mad?

1187
04:28:08,299 --> 04:28:10,299
I'm a liar and an idiot.

1188
04:28:10,299 --> 04:28:12,299
I'm Jerma.

1189
04:28:12,299 --> 04:28:15,879
And a thief.

1190
04:28:15,879 --> 04:28:17,879
This is the regulator axis.

1191
04:28:17,879 --> 04:28:19,879
Where did you get this?

1192
04:28:19,879 --> 04:28:21,879
Let's just say it fell off the back of an army general.

1193
04:28:21,879 --> 04:28:23,879
You know.

1194
04:28:23,879 --> 04:28:32,329
Just in case I had to go to a Plan C.

1195
04:28:32,329 --> 04:28:39,370
Apology accepted.

1196
04:28:39,370 --> 04:28:41,370
New moves are available.

1197
04:28:41,370 --> 04:28:49,069
Bonski files to be unread do this first

1198
04:28:59,190 --> 04:29:01,090
Can I just go up

1199
04:29:01,090 --> 04:29:22,010
No, our surge level three important double super air-dash air cannonball though

1200
04:29:22,889 --> 04:29:59,209
Game a grinder. What is that? Oh and chain was get it. I'll be right back. I'm gonna get some

1201
04:30:00,209 --> 04:30:02,889
Water and take a small pee. I'll be right back

1202
04:30:03,649 --> 04:34:10,610
start

1203
04:34:10,610 --> 04:34:12,610
four and a half hours ago

1204
04:34:20,599 --> 04:34:23,639
Bad joke what long pee I got a water, too. I

1205
04:34:24,680 --> 04:34:28,810
was next

1206
04:34:28,810 --> 04:34:39,479
Me this is called meme dot PNG. Oh

1207
04:34:41,319 --> 04:35:08,299
Going that one either strange cargo. I want that better dash

1208
04:35:09,099 --> 04:35:12,549
Is it a hundred something thousand?

1209
04:35:13,029 --> 04:35:15,419
Something like that

1210
04:35:15,419 --> 04:35:16,880
150,000

1211
04:35:16,880 --> 04:35:23,560
How far away is this? Oh, that's so whatever could have just done this jump pod

1212
04:35:24,220 --> 04:35:42,529
No, not Murius

1213
04:35:42,529 --> 04:35:51,630
We have very little time if Ross and his men realize I've stolen the regulator access

1214
04:35:51,630 --> 04:35:57,750
They'll move to relocate the other half. We can't control power to the machine without it. That's why I'm sending you back out there

1215
04:35:57,750 --> 04:36:01,849
I know it's a risk because of this emergent devil. Hope we had no choice

1216
04:36:02,150 --> 04:36:05,029
What they're going to be on you like ants on a free meal

1217
04:36:05,229 --> 04:36:09,029
Make sure the regulator stays safe because this is our last change

1218
04:36:09,029 --> 04:36:15,470
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, I have to go and retrieve and bring shit back to the church

1219
04:36:15,509 --> 04:36:26,139
Is there any other missions in the game besides get item and put items into item box back at church?

1220
04:36:27,380 --> 04:36:37,659
Apparently they're right here

1221
04:36:39,180 --> 04:36:53,139
Sorry, I get hurt by that

1222
04:37:04,790 --> 04:37:17,139
Lot of you here

1223
04:37:19,099 --> 04:37:25,380
Yeah, so I didn't want to pick you up

1224
04:37:28,700 --> 04:37:30,180
targeting with this

1225
04:37:30,180 --> 04:37:48,479
So this is where we run and we pick up and run pick up run pick up run and that's it

1226
04:37:48,520 --> 04:37:58,580
We don't do anything else. How would practicing my moves help when there's ten people doing moves around me?

1227
04:37:59,299 --> 04:38:02,060
like if I

1228
04:38:03,060 --> 04:38:10,959
I'm just gonna grab it and run you see how close the helicopter was

1229
04:38:11,520 --> 04:38:29,049
I'm just gonna do this. I even fight any of these things

1230
04:38:29,569 --> 04:38:41,459
Wait, did I not get it? Wait, hold on. There was it what it was. It was an inside. It was inside that truck

1231
04:38:41,819 --> 04:39:22,459
Let's wait for the heel bring truck to the military base. Oh

1232
04:39:23,060 --> 04:39:34,259
not the church I

1233
04:39:34,299 --> 04:39:58,819
Can't jump with the truck. So I have to just walk what's just left in this game. It can't be much more

1234
04:39:59,099 --> 04:40:03,500
Right. I took back the fucking secret serum, right? That means that's that where at the end of the game

1235
04:40:04,220 --> 04:40:19,400
Two missions. All right. Well, let's go

1236
04:40:19,919 --> 04:41:07,040
All right, I brought the truck weapon eyes. What what the hell are you doing? I jump. No, there is no jumping

1237
04:41:07,040 --> 04:41:11,319
I mean, this is is this count as plus one letter grade. I mean sure I guess I think it does

1238
04:41:11,799 --> 04:41:16,310
I'm Fred Flint stoning this car, but I am driving the car

1239
04:41:33,319 --> 04:41:36,759
It's just a car coming through, you know, there's no cars drive

1240
04:41:37,400 --> 04:41:50,240
Somebody's got run over wait. I can stop this. He'll see through my what did he hurt? What happened? What is this?

1241
04:41:50,500 --> 04:42:17,349
This is free. Wait, do I have to get it checked? How does this work? Hold on there?

1242
04:42:17,349 --> 04:42:56,290
Are they gonna pat the car down? Yeah, I can't go faster than this

1243
04:42:56,889 --> 04:43:00,889
Why wouldn't I punch through the front and drive the car?

1244
04:43:00,930 --> 04:43:08,560
You know punt my pull my feet up tuck my feet up punch through the front of the bed here and grab the wheel

1245
04:43:08,639 --> 04:43:15,290
I just drive what does this achieve? I can still wear the car but be driving it

1246
04:43:18,970 --> 04:43:21,569
Hope just drive the car. Why do I have to walk with it? Oh

1247
04:43:31,060 --> 04:43:33,060
Retrieve the cube now

1248
04:43:52,979 --> 04:43:57,259
Wrong thing

1249
04:43:57,419 --> 04:44:03,380
Yes, you're the cube

1250
04:44:24,490 --> 04:44:26,970
Football that was American football

1251
04:44:28,950 --> 04:44:30,950
this is American football, but the

1252
04:44:31,590 --> 04:44:34,569
The ball has greased up with oil. Oh

1253
04:44:35,599 --> 04:44:38,360
This sucks. I have to do that whole thing again

1254
04:44:38,959 --> 04:44:49,549
Holy shit. This is horrible. I have to walk the car again

1255
04:44:50,150 --> 04:45:16,700
There has to be a faster way to do that. There was no there is not a faster way to do this

1256
04:45:17,560 --> 04:45:20,750
Like yeah Patriots must be yeah, this is nice

1257
04:45:21,389 --> 04:45:43,599
Good guy

1258
04:45:43,599 --> 04:45:58,189
Did I die did it hit me? I think I'm good

1259
04:45:58,270 --> 04:46:07,740
No, that was nothing wrong

1260
04:46:07,740 --> 04:46:20,139
That was the right warp because I'm gonna despawn all those enemies come back ain't gonna be any enemies there at all

1261
04:46:20,500 --> 04:46:23,060
Rock will be right there and I can walk the truck back in

1262
04:46:23,580 --> 04:46:32,349
Well, these are all funny images you good

1263
04:46:36,299 --> 04:46:50,020
Was that just that wrong warped down there? Wait, what?

1264
04:46:53,520 --> 04:46:57,680
Okay, wait for a second. I thought that

1265
04:46:57,720 --> 04:47:12,099
Good run this back at full health

1266
04:47:12,500 --> 04:47:18,090
How do I have fuck all health of being so close to the end of the game?

1267
04:47:18,090 --> 04:47:25,709
It's only one more health upgrade. I have the first two. There's like three. I think what you're describing is

1268
04:47:26,830 --> 04:47:33,349
It's a decision that the developers made when they made this game. I can't Hulk have like 10,000 more HP

1269
04:47:34,069 --> 04:47:44,430
You know, maybe band length. I'll just turn them off

1270
04:47:44,470 --> 04:47:51,430
Hey, you know each of my lesson turn links off. Just disable links. You know, I'll teach him a lesson

1271
04:47:52,110 --> 04:48:02,930
All right out time to teach him a lesson

1272
04:48:03,529 --> 04:48:12,220
All right. All right

1273
04:48:12,220 --> 04:48:19,720
Mods if people's if people do a link in chat, I'm them up 10 minutes. Got it. That's gonna happen

1274
04:48:20,319 --> 04:48:27,009
That's gonna happen to you. I've just made the order. I just gave the order. It's gonna happen. I the order has been placed

1275
04:48:27,569 --> 04:48:33,750
It's gonna happen. If this if you do purple text with a link

1276
04:48:34,290 --> 04:49:07,040
You're out of here. Ten minutes. That's it purge purge them. Oh you guys are getting fucking destroyed

1277
04:49:07,759 --> 04:49:12,459
Tell you I'm a man of my word 40% of the time. This is one of those times. I

1278
04:49:21,599 --> 04:49:26,479
See you did there. You try to get a nightbot band trying to get a nightbot timed out nightbot has immunity

1279
04:49:27,040 --> 04:49:42,990
Why would I time out nightbot? He controls everything here. I

1280
04:49:47,200 --> 04:49:52,040
Tell it and slowly slowly the links begin to cease

1281
04:49:52,759 --> 04:49:56,340
Ten the ten minute timeout

1282
04:49:57,020 --> 04:50:04,919
It's got them all fucked up. Okay. Let's go

1283
04:50:11,409 --> 04:50:30,060
Hurry go. Where am I going? This is not even the right fucking way to go. It's only one exit. Oh

1284
04:50:45,939 --> 04:50:49,459
shit

1285
04:51:10,560 --> 04:51:16,770
You didn't just do that

1286
04:51:17,569 --> 04:51:38,439
Give me that. Give me them. Give me them. Give me them. They have so many things

1287
04:51:39,639 --> 04:51:41,639
So many things

1288
04:51:45,509 --> 04:51:48,750
Come on Bruce, come on deliver it into the end zone. Oh

1289
04:51:49,750 --> 04:52:11,930
That's done. I did it. I have to get another one. Okay. Here's a very important thing to ask

1290
04:52:12,450 --> 04:52:28,520
Well, I have to pretend to be a car again. I hope I don't have to

1291
04:52:29,060 --> 04:52:37,900
That would be down who just be ridiculous, right? That would be absurd if I had to go pretend to be a car again

1292
04:52:37,900 --> 04:52:40,700
That's just that's outrageous

1293
04:52:41,540 --> 04:53:04,720
Hey, here we go. It's up here

1294
04:53:05,299 --> 04:53:18,029
That it's a trap. Yeah, there's a trap. I mean, that's a pretty nice super computer. I bet that thing has a fucking 2080

1295
04:53:20,680 --> 04:53:30,319
It is a trap boo boo. Ah, whatever

1296
04:53:33,189 --> 04:53:56,540
No, I want to throw it at the thing. All I care about is throwing this shit

1297
04:53:57,060 --> 04:53:58,979
you deck things

1298
04:53:58,979 --> 04:54:06,340
Freak you freak you freak

1299
04:54:11,060 --> 04:54:17,220
5g noise. All right, somebody has to die. I need help

1300
04:54:20,630 --> 04:54:22,630
Did you die outside of the playing area?

1301
04:54:22,790 --> 04:54:40,490
Good. Oh, come on. They all have the grabby move

1302
04:55:15,970 --> 04:55:17,970
Use your combo. Oh

1303
04:55:18,770 --> 04:55:20,770
You know the words to say to get me going

1304
04:55:21,290 --> 04:55:30,060
There's the fucking 5g noises. I'm gonna mess with my brain

1305
04:55:30,740 --> 04:55:44,430
Alright, so here's the plan. Just kill just kill trying to get out of there quickly. I'm just gonna go

1306
04:55:45,310 --> 04:55:47,869
combo combo combo combo hit hit hit hit hit punch punch punch

1307
04:55:48,509 --> 04:55:52,990
Cuz I need help and I cannot fight

1308
04:55:55,110 --> 04:56:02,759
No, no, no, no, it's not gonna happen. No, he took the bait. Wait a minute. What if I just don't go in there?

1309
04:56:03,279 --> 04:56:06,110
Will they spawn outside?

1310
04:56:06,110 --> 04:56:14,830
Wait a minute. What if they spring the trap when I'm not even in it?

1311
04:56:31,229 --> 04:56:38,389
Oh

1312
04:56:38,389 --> 04:57:02,259
My ears. I'm gonna grab

1313
04:57:05,299 --> 04:57:26,590
Like I'm locked on over here, why would you even be turned the other direction?

1314
04:57:27,590 --> 04:57:30,909
What's the point of a lock-on? We don't even fucking lock on

1315
04:57:32,110 --> 04:58:02,029
So many people got timed out. Yeah, that's then the justice has been served

1316
04:58:02,470 --> 04:58:16,439
But it's sorry what you should have said was justice has been served. I have another idea and

1317
04:58:17,279 --> 04:58:19,119
It's dumb enough to work

1318
04:58:19,119 --> 04:58:22,189
It's gonna work. I'm gonna throw

1319
04:58:23,110 --> 04:58:27,549
Like seven or eight items into the arena the hardcore match now

1320
04:58:28,150 --> 04:58:42,439
Cuz I'm just gonna throw it at the 5g towers and that's it

1321
04:58:43,729 --> 04:58:58,459
I'm just gonna run come here. I'm gonna get steel fists

1322
04:59:00,419 --> 04:59:03,240
Tables ladders and chairs mad snow. This is a truck

1323
04:59:03,939 --> 04:59:06,369
street lights and

1324
04:59:06,409 --> 04:59:07,689
mailbox

1325
04:59:07,689 --> 04:59:36,500
Event let's go

1326
04:59:36,500 --> 04:59:42,880
They're all in there. Good. This is perfect. Perfect. Just get this shit done or of them

1327
04:59:43,220 --> 04:59:47,450
You didn't think I was gonna do this shit. Did you?

1328
05:00:04,229 --> 05:00:18,040
What you doing it?

1329
05:00:19,040 --> 05:00:24,080
You doing it again, okay, just a second. I'm not in a cutscene

1330
05:00:30,470 --> 05:00:32,189
That's not fair

1331
05:00:32,189 --> 05:01:25,500
There's two on top of each other here. Why did you stop hitting the towers?

1332
05:01:26,369 --> 05:01:31,450
We think because the games respawned them and while in the cutscene

1333
05:01:32,130 --> 05:01:36,209
Sorry cow. I got it grabbed and got killed and

1334
05:01:36,490 --> 05:01:39,669
What we were watching the same video

1335
05:01:40,729 --> 05:01:57,270
Okay, fucking come on get out of here

1336
05:01:58,110 --> 05:02:00,349
Yes, I know there it is

1337
05:02:01,099 --> 05:02:04,740
We got him tango to whatever he says service

1338
05:02:12,279 --> 05:02:40,150
Tango minus two my fucking god. Oh

1339
05:02:47,540 --> 05:02:49,139
My

1340
05:02:49,139 --> 05:02:54,650
fucking god

1341
05:02:54,930 --> 05:02:57,689
Probability to get grabbed here is like 85%

1342
05:02:57,689 --> 05:02:58,849
85%

1343
05:02:58,849 --> 05:03:27,599
You can't fight them. Have you tried the Hulk smash yet? Shit. I forgot about that one

1344
05:03:28,159 --> 05:03:35,490
What was it called again? What was called Hulk? What? Oh gently pet kitty cat

1345
05:03:36,049 --> 05:03:54,180
Let me just give five thousand bits. Thanks with five thousand bits. That's fifty dollars from Vilemi

1346
05:03:54,180 --> 05:03:56,099
What if I gave you a bunch of money to post links?

1347
05:03:56,099 --> 05:04:02,139
No, you can't and then I do they do asterisk asterisk asterisk that means that they link got timed out

1348
05:04:02,220 --> 05:04:04,220
Fifty dollars and I'm gonna buy you a link you're up

1349
05:04:04,819 --> 05:04:09,459
Thanks for the fifty dollars though. That's a lot of fucking money. That's that's too too much money

1350
05:04:09,939 --> 05:04:12,180
It's an insane amount of money. Thank you for giving it to me

1351
05:04:12,180 --> 05:04:22,830
I can't bring weapons in otherwise the game breaks and decides to respawn everything. I can't fight him cuz I get grabbed

1352
05:04:23,430 --> 05:04:25,150
All right, let's do

1353
05:04:25,150 --> 05:04:28,590
Run and grab and throw what I'm gonna do. You know, here's my strategy already

1354
05:04:29,389 --> 05:04:36,470
Run grab throw run grab throw run grab throw run grab throw run grab throw run grab throw run grab throw run grab throw

1355
05:04:36,630 --> 05:04:38,630
Run grab throw

1356
05:04:38,709 --> 05:04:42,869
Help in here. I don't even need to get it. What's the point?

1357
05:04:43,310 --> 05:05:38,119
Here we go. Oh shit. The cops are here guys. That means you're gonna stop, right?

1358
05:05:38,759 --> 05:05:49,509
God, let me do it

1359
05:06:01,610 --> 05:06:44,819
Helicopter who I have I can't go back in that's not fair. Let me the fuck out of here

1360
05:06:45,020 --> 05:06:51,590
Let me out of here. Let me out. Let me out of here. Let me out of here. Let me out of here

1361
05:06:51,590 --> 05:06:57,659
I did it

1362
05:06:57,819 --> 05:07:19,130
Let's go let me the fuck out of here. Where's there another tower? There's no tower

1363
05:07:19,950 --> 05:07:23,150
There's nothing holding this shit up. It's bullshit

1364
05:07:23,669 --> 05:07:25,389
It's nothing here

1365
05:07:25,389 --> 05:07:39,459
Right there women right there. Where what do you see?

1366
05:07:43,380 --> 05:07:46,779
Behind me. I don't see anything. It's hard to see anything

1367
05:07:47,540 --> 05:07:55,060
Right there right there right there right there right there right there right there

1368
05:07:56,020 --> 05:08:04,020
right there

1369
05:08:08,580 --> 05:08:36,119
Corner of the circle there is circles don't have corners

1370
05:08:40,360 --> 05:08:57,580
Motherfucker but to kill them. Oh, he's got one of our boys

1371
05:08:58,540 --> 05:09:29,099
Okay, all the 5g towers are dead. I just have to kill this one dickhead instead. Okay, let's go

1372
05:09:29,619 --> 05:09:48,389
So that no, that's a 5g air conditioner. That's not a 5g tower. What do I get the fuck out of here?

1373
05:10:13,700 --> 05:10:20,159
What on the street no, that's just a telephone fault

1374
05:10:29,490 --> 05:10:49,110
What are you talking about actually soft-locked but look what's going on over there like this explosion an explosion over there

1375
05:10:49,770 --> 05:11:13,880
Look up. Let me look up

1376
05:11:14,360 --> 05:12:09,860
Okay, I have a minute here to look keep one alive. Keep one. That is it's the air conditioners. It's the 5g air condition

1377
05:12:10,340 --> 05:12:42,009
Just kill me

1378
05:12:42,009 --> 05:13:11,229
The one that's on fire, but I can't target it. I can't target it

1379
05:13:11,229 --> 05:13:49,810
Oh, no, not one of our boys go back to the sewer where you belong. You have the 1.1 B version

1380
05:13:50,369 --> 05:13:52,380
Have to go

1381
05:13:52,380 --> 05:13:54,380
This is the Xbox game

1382
05:13:54,900 --> 05:13:58,939
This is the original Xbox game

1383
05:13:59,720 --> 05:14:12,970
What do you mean? I have to go get like a patch for this. It was no Xbox version Monka s

1384
05:14:13,669 --> 05:14:23,279
Be weird

1385
05:14:23,279 --> 05:14:25,840
Restart your system. Let me try this one more time

1386
05:14:26,080 --> 05:14:33,709
I need a patch. Wait, do I actually need to go download like an Xbox? I

1387
05:14:34,349 --> 05:14:36,349
May even do that on 360

1388
05:14:36,790 --> 05:14:40,090
On a backwards compatible game. Can you connect that exists?

1389
05:14:40,729 --> 05:14:43,279
That's not real, right?

1390
05:14:43,279 --> 05:14:55,229
Hey, there it is. Don't get trapped

1391
05:14:55,770 --> 05:15:02,900
Hey here comes do it put up the towers one, two, three four towers

1392
05:15:03,380 --> 05:15:04,700
That's it

1393
05:15:04,700 --> 05:15:06,639
right

1394
05:15:06,639 --> 05:15:13,319
Go disable the gamma shield. I

1395
05:15:13,880 --> 05:15:50,680
Can't even target the fucking thing

1396
05:15:56,040 --> 05:15:58,040
This is just getting all the keys

1397
05:15:58,560 --> 05:16:03,740
Yes, it is. I get it targeted. I gotta kill somebody

1398
05:16:04,459 --> 05:16:10,540
But now you target it, right? Oh

1399
05:16:39,860 --> 05:16:41,860
My goodness, um, I

1400
05:16:42,419 --> 05:16:46,299
Had it beat the last time too. That's what's so annoying

1401
05:16:46,939 --> 05:16:58,220
It's important. No, this this came out on Xbox and GameCube and PlayStation 3 right PlayStation 2

1402
05:16:58,979 --> 05:17:11,060
This cheat we allow you to all right, here's the deal if this screws up again, I'm gonna cheat

1403
05:17:11,500 --> 05:17:13,419
I'm gonna do an infinite help

1404
05:17:13,419 --> 05:17:18,029
That impossible. I

1405
05:17:18,029 --> 05:17:30,169
Didn't even want to do that. And now I've probably bugged it again. I grabbed a car on the way in here

1406
05:17:30,770 --> 05:18:12,930
Let's see if it works

1407
05:18:12,930 --> 05:18:15,889
Yeah, baby, right. We've got one of our boys

1408
05:18:16,849 --> 05:18:27,389
This is not a drill. He's got one of our boys

1409
05:18:28,229 --> 05:18:36,599
Ah, just give me that health pack

1410
05:18:37,080 --> 05:18:58,419
Give me out of here. I didn't I didn't go go go get this box quick bring I did I get out of the field?

1411
05:18:58,419 --> 05:19:01,819
I think I'm out of the force field. Did I get out of the force field in time?

1412
05:19:02,819 --> 05:19:05,900
I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. They pushed me out

1413
05:19:06,500 --> 05:19:08,419
These fucking idiots push

1414
05:19:08,419 --> 05:19:19,900
No, no, no, no, no

1415
05:19:20,659 --> 05:19:21,979
No

1416
05:19:21,979 --> 05:19:28,299
It's oh

1417
05:19:28,299 --> 05:19:34,000
No

1418
05:19:34,639 --> 05:19:44,720
He's got one of our boys, oh my god, I don't even have any emotions right now

1419
05:19:45,360 --> 05:19:52,580
How what what emotional what emotional thing can I even say? I just gotta

1420
05:20:04,880 --> 05:20:13,200
It's gonna fuck up again, isn't it?

1421
05:20:13,240 --> 05:21:20,490
There's no way this works. Yeah. Yeah. Oh get it. Okay, but look out a trap

1422
05:21:21,009 --> 05:21:29,900
Well, your operation seems to work very well

1423
05:21:30,259 --> 05:21:36,979
Go I'll fucking happen in this time. I'm grabbing that thing and I'm getting the fuck out of here

And

1430
05:23:36,220 --> 05:23:45,540
Out. Thank God. It was horrible. I'm still to deliver the coffee machine

This is I mean, this is a no. This is a science fair battery fucking go. I'm sorry for doubting you

1432
05:24:08,459 --> 05:24:11,860
Please forgive me. I mean, I don't think there was any doubt

1433
05:24:13,139 --> 05:24:22,029
That wasn't I don't think people were truly doubting me and if they were and just just shove it in their face that what I

1434
05:24:22,029 --> 05:24:26,099
Just did a cube. Thanks for the 10 community subs

1435
05:24:27,619 --> 05:24:43,470
216 thanks to the 10 subs. Seriously, I'm gonna I'm a buyer. Let's go. The cat just woke up and missed your stream

1436
05:24:43,470 --> 05:24:45,470
Can you start over?

1437
05:24:46,669 --> 05:24:49,779
Fucking cat

1438
05:24:49,779 --> 05:24:57,610
Yeah, let me start the stream over the cat. Here we go. Wait. No, no

1439
05:24:58,490 --> 05:25:00,490
I'm gonna save it for power surge

1440
05:25:01,130 --> 05:25:20,439
Yeah, save it for that. I'm not buying anything till power surge 3 a freedom's swan song coming up

1441
05:25:21,200 --> 05:25:29,779
Bruce they're closing in fast. Look just keep on the task of finishing the machine

1442
05:25:30,380 --> 05:25:33,580
I'll take care of the military literally roughly 10 minutes

1443
05:25:33,779 --> 05:25:39,299
It's gonna be a bumpy ride and minutes to stop them from destroying the church. God damn it

1444
05:25:39,299 --> 05:25:41,299
Okay, defend the church for 10 minutes

1445
05:25:42,340 --> 05:25:46,110
But last time it was a huge

1446
05:25:46,869 --> 05:25:54,419
Overestimation it's gonna be like four. It was a major overestimate last time. This guy's really bad with time

1447
05:25:54,419 --> 05:25:56,020
He just wants to make sure he's not

1448
05:25:56,020 --> 05:25:59,580
We you'd rather have a lot of time than a little right? Oh

1449
05:26:01,009 --> 05:26:03,009

What come on? I gotta kill the toddler planes

1452
05:26:37,680 --> 05:26:54,520
They're the hardest things. What does that mean? How do you dodge that?

1453
05:27:09,580 --> 05:27:23,060
Goddamn it. I have to jump on it. They can just avoid it so easily. Where's the other one?

1454
05:27:23,700 --> 05:27:29,659

1457
05:28:00,299 --> 05:28:23,419
Shit, they got one of my boys. Which one's gonna come in first? Probably this one

1479
05:33:33,330 --> 05:33:35,330
This next part will be very unpleasant

1480
05:33:36,450 --> 05:33:47,459
He's like vaporized me

05:34:00,840 --> 05:34:11,799

Wait, why is there an error?

1487
05:35:18,919 --> 05:35:30,810
Dude, you can accidentally just press it a and it turn the console off. He said so bad the Xbox died

1488
05:35:31,369 --> 05:35:36,270
Creature

No, it's one down. I don't know what that really means to third egg almost destroyed

1494
05:36:53,869 --> 05:37:12,369
Third egg defeat it. They beat him. I heard him now

Something I just got it off. Holy shit. I just did the super critical pain. I did was groin the hell

1496
05:37:29,569 --> 05:37:39,950
All right. Now what this is like phase two. Do these have health in them?

1497
05:37:48,889 --> 05:37:53,819
All right, just kick them in the tail

1498
05:38:12,680 --> 05:38:14,849
Don't go on the fire

1499
05:38:14,849 --> 05:38:22,229
But the eggs are coming back. Okay, all three eggs need to be destroyed before you can affect

1500
05:38:22,709 --> 05:38:52,250
Crocodile man, I feel like how I used to feel when I would play a game that I knew

1501
05:38:52,889 --> 05:38:56,209
My computer couldn't handle back in like 2002

1502
05:38:56,930 --> 05:38:59,930
But I wanted to try anyways and you pretended

1503
05:39:00,490 --> 05:39:07,529
To not care and you really did everything possible to not get annoyed at the fact that your computer wasn't good enough

1504
05:39:07,529 --> 05:39:12,209
Because you had like a fucking g-force like 300 M in your computer

1505
05:39:14,090 --> 05:39:20,110
It's hard to not be angry

1506
05:39:29,259 --> 05:39:30,459

05:39:30,459 --> 05:39:33,919

In fact Bruce, I can't tell you the last time I actually did have diarrhea

1521
05:42:47,900 --> 05:42:54,759
It had to have been at least two years ago. I don't know why I continue to say that

05:48:01,150 --> 05:48:20,279

1536
05:48:23,950 --> 05:48:26,750
Don't get greedy don't get greedy don't get greedy just run away

1537
05:48:38,349 --> 05:48:39,869
Save that critical mass

1538
05:48:39,869 --> 05:49:17,319
Out out out out out. What are you crazy?

1539
05:49:18,729 --> 05:49:30,110

That's it. He's dead. No, he's not. Oh, oh my god

1542
05:50:02,819 --> 05:50:04,819

1543
05:50:08,580 --> 05:50:21,979
I win. Yeah, you got nothing you're dead. He's gonna get up here in his health. I'm gonna go to zero

1544
05:50:41,970 --> 05:50:42,849
Yeah

1545
05:50:42,849 --> 05:50:52,419
It's a terrible. I just died thing to say

1546
05:50:53,700 --> 05:51:00,029
No, this is the wrong way

1547
05:51:00,430 --> 05:51:03,299
Oh

1548
05:51:04,419 --> 05:51:17,439
There's no face too

1549
05:51:17,439 --> 05:51:28,529
Not gonna happen. It'd be funny. Let's face two

1550
05:51:32,270 --> 05:52:34,369
Save it and I can get the final upgrade. All right, give me one second. Oh what happened? Why is it dark?

1551
05:52:35,970 --> 05:52:37,970
This is what death is like

1552
05:52:38,689 --> 05:52:45,060
What happened?

1553
05:52:45,060 --> 05:52:47,169
Wait

1554
05:52:47,169 --> 05:52:49,169
I changed to the wrong scene

1555
05:52:50,209 --> 05:52:52,450
This is apparently this is a scene here

1556
05:52:53,409 --> 05:52:58,669
Oops, sorry about that. I pressed the wrong button

1557
05:52:59,229 --> 05:53:06,419
All right

1558
05:53:06,419 --> 05:53:08,720
Get the last health upgrade

1559
05:53:09,200 --> 05:53:11,569
I don't think that's the end of the game

1560
05:53:11,569 --> 05:53:13,889
That's probably very close power surge level three

1561
05:53:14,689 --> 05:53:16,689
Yes

1562
05:53:17,250 --> 05:53:19,889
Okay

1563
05:53:19,889 --> 05:53:21,889
Critical mass level two

1564
05:53:23,099 --> 05:53:25,709
Yeah

1565
05:53:25,709 --> 05:53:31,169
and

1566
05:53:31,169 --> 05:53:33,169
Missile pack weaponize

1567
05:53:34,669 --> 05:53:37,599
Yeah

1568
05:53:37,599 --> 05:53:41,680
Good any others

1569
05:53:42,240 --> 05:53:45,970
Air sonic clap sure imb in the air cool

1570
05:53:46,450 --> 05:53:58,830
All right. I wonder that that has that was definitely the big apex of the whole game that this has to be the end

1571
05:54:17,979 --> 05:54:27,009
Back to the badlands

1572
05:54:27,009 --> 05:54:30,049
The final boss wasn't patched into the xbox version. That would be weird

1573
05:54:32,430 --> 05:54:34,669
Where is it? Uh down

1574
05:54:40,270 --> 05:54:43,520
World one complete

1575
05:54:43,520 --> 05:54:45,840
No, this is this is called intercept

1576
05:54:46,720 --> 05:54:51,200
Do I actually have to intercept?

1577
05:54:52,000 --> 05:54:54,000
another convoy

1578
05:54:54,000 --> 05:55:00,319
Okay, your superhero duties are boring radiation signature coming from a cave near the vault

1579
05:55:00,799 --> 05:55:04,099
It looks like blonsky's undergone yet another transformation

1580
05:55:04,560 --> 05:55:08,830
The creatures headed back towards the inner containment area bruce reached the vault

1581
05:55:10,029 --> 05:55:12,909
Reach the vault entrance just get to the vault entrance. I'm just gonna run

1582
05:55:13,549 --> 05:55:29,119
I can't go in like this

1583
05:55:29,119 --> 05:55:32,580
I'm losing my mind

1584
05:55:32,659 --> 05:55:38,540
I thought I just killed him

1585
05:55:43,759 --> 05:55:45,119
Oh different guy

1586
05:55:45,119 --> 05:56:13,970
Let's go get him

1587
05:56:13,970 --> 05:56:17,040
Okay reach

1588
05:56:17,279 --> 05:56:19,279
Get to the vault entrance

1589
05:56:19,279 --> 05:56:21,279
The vault entrance is down there

1590
05:56:21,439 --> 05:56:24,819
I'm not gonna waste a second here. Let's go

1591
05:56:25,380 --> 05:56:29,569
I want to get some help

1592
05:56:29,569 --> 05:56:31,169
and

1593
05:56:31,169 --> 05:56:47,090
Fuck fighting a single thing

1594
05:56:47,810 --> 05:56:49,810
What who what superhero uses the front door

1595
05:57:08,509 --> 05:57:10,509
Pirate's elbow ain't gonna get me

1596
05:57:11,389 --> 05:57:15,150
You ain't gonna get me. You ain't gonna get me. You ain't gonna get me

1597
05:57:16,430 --> 05:57:20,349
No, you really want to try but it's not going to happen

1598
05:57:21,069 --> 05:57:23,950
Not going to happen

1599
05:57:25,229 --> 05:57:26,659
not

1600
05:57:26,659 --> 05:57:28,659
going to

1601
05:57:29,580 --> 05:57:30,700
Happen

1602
05:57:30,700 --> 05:57:48,689
Probably shouldn't have skipped everything

1603
05:57:48,849 --> 05:57:52,909
I'm gonna do the headbutt to this guy. It's the best move in the game

1604
05:57:53,630 --> 05:58:09,740
Although I can't do the cannonball. I don't have the cannonball. I bought the health and surge upgrades. Whatever they're called

1605
05:58:10,619 --> 05:58:16,380
All right. I'll just throw cars

1606
05:58:16,380 --> 05:58:18,380
Steel fist no throw car is more effective

1607
05:58:18,939 --> 05:58:31,599
How does that miss? Okay again

1608
05:58:32,659 --> 05:58:33,700
Again

1609
05:58:33,700 --> 05:58:50,049
Throw a car again. I'll make sure I get that thing. Don't worry

1610
05:58:50,770 --> 05:58:57,470
It's a secret and we're gonna well, don't we we'll look at those those those comics

1611
05:58:58,430 --> 05:59:09,299
Got a few more of these

1612
05:59:11,919 --> 05:59:19,900
Hey

1613
05:59:19,900 --> 05:59:33,939
What? All right. I need the

1614
05:59:34,740 --> 05:59:36,020
Move this way

1615
05:59:36,020 --> 05:59:42,669
Can I turn these into fists? Oh, I can't

1616
05:59:44,110 --> 05:59:50,259
Dumb why's it no longer damaging him? I think it doesn't hurt him

1617
05:59:54,080 --> 05:59:55,040
Um

1618
05:59:55,040 --> 05:59:57,470
Why am I getting diminishing returns?

1619
05:59:57,630 --> 06:00:15,779
You can't even avoid that attack it's unavoidable use the combo

1620
06:00:27,340 --> 06:00:30,259
Um, can I not fucking hurt this guy?

1621
06:00:31,439 --> 06:00:43,919
What is with this game?

1622
06:00:43,919 --> 06:00:45,919
You can't fucking avoid that attack

1623
06:01:00,130 --> 06:01:02,130
Use elbow drop play on how?

1624
06:01:02,770 --> 06:01:11,700
I can't grab on to anything. I can't grab anything. I can't i'm just gonna do this fine. Okay, I

1625
06:01:13,069 --> 06:01:15,630
That actually just fucking work

1626
06:01:15,709 --> 06:01:21,409
That's okay. That's

1627
06:01:23,250 --> 06:01:26,209
No other moves work on him though only elbow drop

1628
06:01:28,220 --> 06:01:30,220
Oh my god

1629
06:01:32,349 --> 06:01:34,349
Of course, that's the one that works

1630
06:01:37,299 --> 06:01:48,130
All right. We're good. I hope this is just a qte end of the game

1631
06:01:48,849 --> 06:01:50,849
The one time that I actually want it

1632
06:01:51,250 --> 06:01:53,250
That last boss fight was hell

1633
06:01:53,250 --> 06:02:05,709
Baby, i'm here blonsky. I should have come back sooner. Oh god

1634
06:02:07,069 --> 06:02:09,299
I've lost her

1635
06:02:09,299 --> 06:02:11,220
I don't understand

1636
06:02:11,220 --> 06:02:15,779
Is this mission directive? I only wanted to help her bet. That's all I wanted

1637
06:02:16,500 --> 06:02:20,740
She's gone

1638
06:02:20,740 --> 06:02:22,979
What's happening here? Emil? Who is she?

1639
06:02:23,619 --> 06:02:25,439
my wife

1640
06:02:25,439 --> 06:02:28,479
Nadia and my unborn child

1641
06:02:29,619 --> 06:02:39,299
They affected our job was to examine what we knew of gamma radiation and its effect on human tissue

1642
06:02:39,939 --> 06:02:43,139
It was a government sparked by your previous research

1643
06:02:43,860 --> 06:02:46,740
She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer

1644
06:02:48,529 --> 06:02:50,110
Emil

1645
06:02:50,110 --> 06:02:52,110
It's time to bring this to an end

1646
06:02:52,430 --> 06:02:58,509
No, you created gamma transmutation banner you did this to her there it is

1647
06:02:59,869 --> 06:03:10,540
Because of you and your damned experiments kill them you damn freak and now i'm going to return the favor

1648
06:03:13,779 --> 06:03:15,779
Can he swim kind of looks like a fish guy

1649
06:03:27,389 --> 06:03:29,389
Pursue and attack abomination

1650
06:03:29,950 --> 06:03:36,849
Bruce, this is samson

1651
06:03:36,849 --> 06:03:39,810
I know you can hear me. I need you to listen carefully

1652
06:03:39,889 --> 06:03:44,130
Okay, blonsky's headed out of town towards the hydroelectric dam above the city

1653
06:03:44,610 --> 06:03:47,169
You've got to stop him before he can do any damage

1654
06:03:47,650 --> 06:03:50,930
There's not enough time to evacuate everyone unless you can hold him

1655
06:03:51,569 --> 06:03:53,569
What the fuck is this dude? Do you hear me?

1656
06:03:54,130 --> 06:03:55,650
bruce

1657
06:03:55,650 --> 06:04:01,340
all right, there's one reason why this would be okay for me is if

1658
06:04:02,139 --> 06:04:07,340
You sent me this voicemail like an hour ago, and I just had really bad cell phone reception

1659
06:04:07,340 --> 06:04:09,340
Then you were trying to warn me an hour ago

1660
06:04:11,099 --> 06:04:12,880

1661
06:04:12,880 --> 06:04:20,220

1666
06:04:39,779 --> 06:04:41,060
Why is he so?

1667
06:04:41,060 --> 06:04:44,000
Just use him as a shield. They'll just kill him

1668
06:04:49,549 --> 06:04:51,549
Just shoot the big guy. He's a bigger target

1669
06:04:58,000 --> 06:05:03,939
Shoot him

1670
06:05:03,939 --> 06:05:09,380

Did you just grab one? I think he just killed one. No, he's running away

1683
06:06:10,560 --> 06:06:20,860
Don't let him get the fuck away

1684
06:06:21,500 --> 06:06:28,220

You're doing that to yourself

1704
06:08:24,580 --> 06:08:27,700
Me and toad guy have not done a single thing

1705
06:08:28,419 --> 06:08:30,419
We haven't done anything

1706
06:08:30,939 --> 06:08:33,020
Maybe you shouldn't let toadless fly planes

1707
06:08:33,740 --> 06:08:46,110
All right, I gotta get up

1708
06:08:46,110 --> 06:08:47,939

Okay, man, man just stew

1713
06:09:29,630 --> 06:09:31,310
Can we stop?

1714
06:09:31,310 --> 06:09:40,860
I gotta get in front of him so he can take that fucking pain

1715
06:09:41,819 --> 06:09:46,159
It's both of us man. We gotta both do this

1716
06:09:48,560 --> 06:09:50,319

06:09:51,119 --> 06:09:56,060
I jumped way too high

1719
06:09:56,060 --> 06:09:57,500
I gotta fight him

1720
06:09:57,500 --> 06:09:59,869
Oh, no. No. No, I do not

1721
06:10:00,189 --> 06:10:16,319
This is fucking stupid

1722
06:10:16,799 --> 06:10:21,599
This is this is stupidest fucking thing. I think i've ever seen

1723
06:10:22,959 --> 06:10:26,369
I don't we're not even fighting each other

1724
06:10:27,169 --> 06:10:31,779
Stop shooting the missiles at me

1725
06:10:33,729 --> 06:10:35,729
Well, he's just as irritated as I am

1726
06:10:36,700 --> 06:10:40,779
All right, should I go for a ball? Should I try to ball him? I'm gonna try to bowling ball him

1727
06:10:41,659 --> 06:10:43,819
All right, here we go. I'm gonna bowl him. I'm gonna get the last hit on him

1728
06:10:44,459 --> 06:10:51,139
Okay, here we go bowling

1729
06:10:51,139 --> 06:11:00,220
No, that's not

1730
06:11:00,220 --> 06:11:08,669
What the?

1731
06:11:12,770 --> 06:11:14,770
This is too much for my brain

1732
06:11:15,650 --> 06:11:23,490
This is way too much. I feel like i'm cheating somehow. Don't you feel like I did this that I turned this shit on?

1733
06:11:24,610 --> 06:11:31,520
Here we go again another fight

1734
06:11:31,759 --> 06:11:33,759
Okay, here we go fight

1735
06:11:34,779 --> 06:11:36,779
I brought all my friends

1736
06:11:44,220 --> 06:11:45,419
Jesus

1737
06:11:45,419 --> 06:11:50,860
I don't want to destroy any of them

1738
06:11:51,250 --> 06:11:53,490
I want them to be here. I don't want them to die

1739
06:11:54,369 --> 06:11:58,080
It's making this way easier

1740
06:11:58,639 --> 06:12:05,599
Is he regaining health? I don't think so

1741
06:12:06,080 --> 06:12:10,639
I think this is just supposed to happen except I don't think it's supposed to be like 10 planes fighting us

1742
06:12:11,360 --> 06:12:13,360
I think because I aggroed everything

1743
06:12:20,540 --> 06:12:23,340
I don't think this no, I don't think this is supposed to be how this plays out

1744
06:12:24,319 --> 06:12:28,290
What it is?

1745
06:12:28,290 --> 06:12:30,209
No, don't hit the plane. Fuck

1746
06:12:30,209 --> 06:12:32,900
Okay, let's keep going

1747
06:12:32,900 --> 06:12:36,560
He's headed for the dam

1748
06:12:36,560 --> 06:12:41,490
He's going for the dam. Stop him

1749
06:12:44,450 --> 06:12:46,450
Don't let him hit it

1750
06:12:47,819 --> 06:12:51,090
Oh, no

1751
06:12:57,630 --> 06:13:00,830
Why

1752
06:13:05,180 --> 06:13:07,979
No, it's gonna come back right it's not gonna do this

1753
06:13:09,840 --> 06:13:12,930
Please

1754
06:13:12,930 --> 06:13:18,180
I'm taking the disc out. All right, put it back in quick

1755
06:14:06,770 --> 06:14:12,849
Oh, you can't believe it. I can't believe he's the cutscene for him to break into the dam

1756
06:14:16,830 --> 06:14:37,470
Wait a minute. What is this bullshit? What is this bullshit? What is this? What is this bullshit? What is this?

1757
06:14:39,229 --> 06:14:51,459
This is the mission before that. Okay. We've got a weird gamma. Okay. We've got a weird gamma radiation

1758
06:14:52,400 --> 06:14:59,630
How did I not?

1759
06:15:00,689 --> 06:15:02,689
It's over. Oh

1760
06:15:03,250 --> 06:15:10,270
I can't go on like this

1761
06:15:10,270 --> 06:15:12,909
And this one sucked didn't it? This one sucked, right?

1762
06:15:13,709 --> 06:15:21,950
No, this one's not that bad. It's not that bad. Okay

1763
06:15:22,830 --> 06:15:27,790
All right. So I can't believe he crashed at the dam. I can't believe he crashed in the dam of all the places

1764
06:15:27,869 --> 06:15:29,869
He crashed at the dam

1765
06:15:29,950 --> 06:15:31,869
I can't believe it

1766
06:15:31,869 --> 06:15:32,990
Unbelievable

1767
06:15:32,990 --> 06:15:44,720
It's gonna crash again

1768
06:15:44,720 --> 06:15:45,919
No, it's not

1769
06:15:45,919 --> 06:15:51,250
Don't say that

1770
06:15:51,250 --> 06:16:07,619
There's only one way to that was seriously I had i'm so glad we played this game all the way to the end here

1771
06:16:08,580 --> 06:16:09,779
because that

1772
06:16:09,779 --> 06:16:11,299
last mission

1773
06:16:11,299 --> 06:16:12,419
was

1774
06:16:12,419 --> 06:16:14,900
Just one of the most ridiculous things I think i've seen in a video game

1775
06:16:15,459 --> 06:16:20,180
Like I can't even believe that's possible. Like this shouldn't even that shouldn't even be possible

1776
06:16:21,500 --> 06:16:23,500
But I i'm glad I got to see it

1777
06:16:24,799 --> 06:16:26,479
All right, kill this guy

1778
06:16:26,479 --> 06:16:58,270
All right. We're not that far back. Wait, what? How did you miss the elbow drop? How did you land on a wall?

1779
06:16:58,990 --> 06:17:01,229
How do you land on the wall?

1780
06:17:02,740 --> 06:17:11,619
I don't understand

1781
06:17:11,619 --> 06:17:17,150
Get down

1782
06:17:17,150 --> 06:17:22,979
Where's this guy?

1783
06:17:22,979 --> 06:17:33,740
Get crushed. I'm so glad this actually works

1784
06:17:34,380 --> 06:17:37,819
How sad would it be if I had to actually fight this boss again and potentially lose?

1785
06:17:45,919 --> 06:17:58,240
Huge one to end it. He's trying to do the same shit to me

1786
06:18:04,130 --> 06:18:10,369
There you go. Get the fuck out of here. I win. All right, save the game. Wait, maybe could I not even save the game?

1787
06:18:11,330 --> 06:18:16,509
Is that part of the problem?

1788
06:18:17,409 --> 06:18:18,930
Those coins are

1789
06:18:18,930 --> 06:18:28,959
All right, I got full health

1790
06:18:28,959 --> 06:18:35,630
We just have to do this shit again because it's the same mission

1791
06:18:38,720 --> 06:18:44,180
Are you sure I couldn't save?

1792
06:18:44,180 --> 06:18:46,180
No, it's because it was the same mission

1793
06:18:48,590 --> 06:18:58,590
Right. That's why oh, this is bad. Did raid come in? Oh shit. We did

1794
06:18:59,790 --> 06:19:02,299
Thanks, lazy purple

1795
06:19:02,299 --> 06:19:09,409
Welcome everybody. We're currently trying to do the mission for the second time. We got fucking destroyed

1796
06:19:10,369 --> 06:19:12,450
I

1797
06:19:12,450 --> 06:19:14,849
Can't save it. Yeah, this just can't happen again

1798
06:19:15,810 --> 06:19:18,689
Welcome guys. Thanks a lot. You guys had a good stream

1799
06:19:19,650 --> 06:19:22,080
We've had a good stream here

1800
06:19:22,080 --> 06:19:23,360
Check this out

1801
06:19:23,360 --> 06:19:26,430
You're about to see something real fucked up

1802
06:19:27,229 --> 06:19:29,229
Don't do it again. Let's go

1803
06:19:31,340 --> 06:19:32,779
Just move

1804
06:19:32,779 --> 06:19:35,020
Move with him. You don't have to die. I just have to do anything

1805
06:19:35,740 --> 06:19:45,939
Just heal when I can and that's it. Just grab health clues

1806
06:19:46,740 --> 06:19:49,220
Cubes and squares together health cubes

1807
06:19:50,459 --> 06:19:51,979
I don't know. I've known

1808
06:19:51,979 --> 06:20:04,669
Here we go. Where is he? There he is. Stay with him

1809
06:20:09,439 --> 06:20:11,439
Smash five see what happens. Okay

1810
06:20:17,229 --> 06:20:19,229
Gotta get back up to the fully kill me

1811
06:20:19,229 --> 06:20:25,709
All right, we're about 10% of the way there. That's so much more to do

1812
06:20:26,849 --> 06:20:29,020
We have to run

1813
06:20:29,020 --> 06:20:37,919
All the way all the way

1814
06:20:39,680 --> 06:20:45,020
In fact, i'm getting ready

1815
06:20:45,020 --> 06:20:54,529
All right with my friends

1816
06:20:54,529 --> 06:21:06,180
Get them planes

1817
06:21:06,819 --> 06:21:08,819
And then nice miss

1818
06:21:09,939 --> 06:21:15,950
Why would you even attack me at this point?

1819
06:21:20,830 --> 06:21:31,229
Always just hide. How are you all this bad at aiming? You hit me every time. Why can't you hit him?

1820
06:21:44,290 --> 06:21:52,540
Get him this motherfucker is gonna kill me

1821
06:22:04,209 --> 06:22:07,150
I don't know but probably pretty thick

1822
06:22:07,790 --> 06:22:16,319
Is this a missile? I need them. I need a missile launcher. I want to make the weapon

1823
06:22:16,880 --> 06:22:28,779
But then I can just walk around with them fire missiles at him

1824
06:22:32,580 --> 06:22:34,580
Over here, right missile launcher guy

1825
06:22:34,740 --> 06:22:41,169

I don't know what you want me to do

1846
06:25:45,729 --> 06:25:47,090
Is it better?

1847
06:25:47,090 --> 06:25:53,330
All right. Here it is. This is where it all went to shit after this part

1848
06:25:54,049 --> 06:26:01,979
Okay, here we go fight

06:26:17,419 --> 06:26:19,419

06:26:19,500 --> 06:26:21,500
Yeah, what about those?

1851
06:26:27,729 --> 06:26:42,580

1852
06:26:42,659 --> 06:26:44,659
No, he made me drop my toy

1853
06:26:45,220 --> 06:26:58,130
Get away from me. Get away from me. Get away from me. What?

06:26:58,930 --> 06:27:12,669
Give me that back. All right, can we?

1855
06:27:13,229 --> 06:27:20,819
Here it comes. It's the last part here

1856
06:27:25,380 --> 06:27:27,380
And I got the whole team here

1857
06:27:28,020 --> 06:27:31,139

06:27:31,220 --> 06:27:32,819
Oh fuck

06:27:32,819 --> 06:27:41,540
This is it. This is it. This is where he runs into the damn

1860
06:27:42,259 --> 06:27:48,740
I gotta get that health before anything bad happens

1861
06:27:50,220 --> 06:27:52,220
It's so hard to control this

1862
06:27:58,590 --> 06:28:02,029
This shit is fucking unbelievable. Like you don't understand

1863
06:28:02,830 --> 06:28:06,799
All right, here we go. This is it. Here it comes

1864
06:28:07,279 --> 06:28:19,569
Try kill some of the planes. Okay, i'm gonna destroy some of the planes. I gotta there's too many planes

1865
06:28:19,970 --> 06:28:22,450
This too is gonna happen again, it's gonna happen again. It's gonna happen again

1866
06:28:24,590 --> 06:28:25,950
Kill planes quick

1867
06:28:25,950 --> 06:28:36,450
I gotta kill the planes

1868
06:28:36,450 --> 06:28:38,979
for another rock

1869
06:28:38,979 --> 06:28:45,810

1870
06:28:50,700 --> 06:28:52,060
Got no one got one

Okay, fuck. All right. Just don't don't do it do it

1872
06:29:07,680 --> 06:29:08,959
Do it

1873
06:29:08,959 --> 06:29:12,240
Go into the damn forget about all the planes

1874
06:29:15,860 --> 06:29:17,860

Yes, it worked

1878
06:29:31,500 --> 06:29:34,400
Thank god

1879
06:29:34,400 --> 06:29:35,599
Okay

1880
06:29:35,599 --> 06:29:36,959
end game

1881
06:29:36,959 --> 06:29:39,229
We're in the end game now

1882
06:29:39,229 --> 06:29:52,290
This message contains a coded subliminal. I'm hoping you can use it to track your target on the map

1883
06:29:53,090 --> 06:29:56,770
All right, this is end game. Do not allow abomination to destroy the damn

1884
06:29:57,490 --> 06:30:00,529
Don't let him destroy the damn

1885
06:30:00,529 --> 06:30:03,470
Sounds fucking hard

1886
06:30:08,110 --> 06:30:18,560
Defeat abomination

1887
06:30:18,560 --> 06:30:22,590
No, they came with me

1888
06:30:23,310 --> 06:30:26,830
Really all about batter

1889
06:30:28,619 --> 06:30:33,150
Firing missiles

1890
06:30:33,150 --> 06:30:35,150
Don't let him destroy the damn

1891
06:30:41,060 --> 06:30:45,040
Oh, I am trust me. I am

1892
06:31:02,459 --> 06:31:19,299
Fire fire at it. Whip it at him. All right, here we go. That's where I want him

06:31:28,700 --> 06:31:30,540
Don't oh fuck. He got me

It's okay. Stay right here

1895
06:31:41,150 --> 06:31:47,680
Do not allow him to do this

1896
06:31:49,360 --> 06:31:57,939
Um, how am I how do I stop him? What is he doing?

1897
06:32:01,650 --> 06:32:04,220
Did I stop him?

1898
06:32:04,220 --> 06:32:08,139
Holy shit, I just electrocuted him for two full health bars

1899
06:32:08,939 --> 06:32:21,279

06:33:50,430 --> 06:33:52,430
Of course, he would be easier than safe

1909
06:33:52,669 --> 06:33:57,150
Go to one of the generators dude, aren't you don't you want to go break one of the generators?

1910
06:34:02,110 --> 06:34:04,430
Don't fire me

1911
06:34:04,430 --> 06:34:06,689
firing on me

1912
06:34:06,689 --> 06:34:10,880
You're stupid

1913
06:34:10,880 --> 06:34:13,119
You're just dumb. You're firing at the wrong person

1914
06:34:16,450 --> 06:34:25,340
Wait, here we go. Oh shit

1915
06:34:29,009 --> 06:34:31,009
Get on top of it. I gotta get up there

06:34:32,299 --> 06:34:34,860
Don't get electrocuted you fucking stupid game

1917
06:34:43,729 --> 06:34:45,729
It's such a sloppy fucking mess

1918
06:34:47,360 --> 06:34:49,680
Oh my god, what's with the nuke?

1919
06:34:58,659 --> 06:35:00,659
Kill him with fucking cards. Who cares?

1920
06:35:02,779 --> 06:35:04,779
I gotta what did I just catch?

1921
06:35:12,049 --> 06:35:13,970
Oh, it's a mess

1922
06:35:13,970 --> 06:35:17,250
It's a fucking mess, but i'm gonna beat him. I beat him. I win game over see you tomorrow

1923
06:35:17,810 --> 06:35:35,020
There's a phase two probably

1924
06:35:35,020 --> 06:36:03,630
Did you actually just take out the damn?

1925
06:36:03,709 --> 06:36:09,150
Wait, did he just accidentally kill himself?

1926
06:36:10,189 --> 06:36:27,729
First today releasing almost 20 million metric tons of water in a statement released this morning

1927
06:36:27,970 --> 06:36:31,270
General thaddeus ross blamed the hulk for their devastation

1928
06:36:32,930 --> 06:36:34,930
We had the cure

1929
06:36:34,930 --> 06:36:36,930
It was right there in front of us

1930
06:36:37,009 --> 06:36:40,930
Dreams always are len, but you can never reach out and take them now, can you?

1931
06:36:41,569 --> 06:36:43,650
We could start again and finish this time

1932
06:36:44,369 --> 06:36:48,880
Still helicopters everywhere to let me help you. I can't stay here

1933
06:36:50,020 --> 06:36:52,020
They're too afraid of the hulk to let you try

1934
06:36:52,740 --> 06:36:55,360
I guess this is me len

1935
06:36:56,000 --> 06:36:58,159
I'm not a person anymore. I'm the hulk

1936
06:36:58,959 --> 06:37:00,959
And I can't force people to understand

1937
06:37:04,049 --> 06:37:06,049
Even in cutscenes, it doesn't matter

1938
06:37:06,369 --> 06:37:09,950
This doesn't make any sense bruce

1939
06:37:11,150 --> 06:37:13,150
You don't have anywhere to go

1940
06:37:13,150 --> 06:37:25,759
I don't know people going to work in the morning

1941
06:37:26,400 --> 06:37:28,400
people going on vacation

1942
06:37:28,400 --> 06:37:31,020
we're going to

1943
06:37:31,020 --> 06:37:33,020
the funeral for one of the

1944
06:37:33,560 --> 06:37:36,220
500,000 people you've killed over the last five days bruce

1945
06:37:37,020 --> 06:37:43,819
Will you tell me?

1946
06:37:43,819 --> 06:37:46,299
Congratulations, you've defeated abomination and have completed the game

1947
06:37:46,939 --> 06:37:49,259
You've unlocked hard. I'll never play that one

1948
06:37:55,020 --> 06:37:57,020
Savage banner is now available

1949
06:37:59,520 --> 06:38:07,180
Enter villain to play the game as abomination. That's cool

1950
06:38:10,000 --> 06:38:19,360
Go check the comics. I will you can play as banner the human. That's so stupid

1951
06:38:20,880 --> 06:38:25,869
All right, what is savage banner?

1952
06:38:26,349 --> 06:38:29,810
I don't have access to savage banner

1953
06:38:35,169 --> 06:38:36,849
Where is it?

1954
06:38:36,849 --> 06:38:39,310
Wait, it was at the very top

1955
06:38:39,310 --> 06:38:44,020
I figured it'd be all the way at the bottom savage banner

1956
06:38:44,979 --> 06:38:55,250
You just play as just half naked guy

1957
06:38:57,779 --> 06:38:59,299
Well, that's funny

1958
06:38:59,299 --> 06:39:01,299
Why couldn't I have had that from the beginning of the game?

1959
06:39:02,020 --> 06:39:18,180
All right. Well, let's um, let's go to

1960
06:39:18,819 --> 06:39:20,900
Uh, let's go back extras

1961
06:39:22,180 --> 06:39:29,700
Okay art gallery comic book gallery gallery one. Let's see here. He is

1962
06:39:30,419 --> 06:39:42,990
Incredible hulk the original comic book was just a direct ripoff of frankenstein incredible hope the monster unleashed

1963
06:39:46,000 --> 06:39:51,819
banner the incredible hulk

1964
06:39:52,299 --> 06:39:55,900
They're smashing out and nothing can stop them. Well, it's the juggernaut

1965
06:39:56,540 --> 06:39:58,540
Side by side with the juggernaut

1966
06:40:04,669 --> 06:40:06,669
Incredible hulk and the wolverine

1967
06:40:07,310 --> 06:40:09,630
He's a bad guy hulk was a bad guy for like the first

1968
06:40:10,349 --> 06:40:11,470
30 years

1969
06:40:11,470 --> 06:40:24,340
That's the first comic that wolverine was in what's someone to star on it?

1970
06:40:31,419 --> 06:40:37,889
Who will judge the hulk?

1971
06:40:38,189 --> 06:40:40,930
Fantastic for mr. Mr. Slippery arms. It's like

1972
06:40:42,209 --> 06:40:44,209
I know he's like the smartest man in the world

1973
06:40:47,659 --> 06:41:02,060
His power is just goofy. He's like a clay fighter. Incredible hulk versus the rhino

1974
06:41:09,150 --> 06:41:12,000
Twice the rage

1975
06:41:12,000 --> 06:41:17,099
Cool with me and the boys

1976
06:41:18,319 --> 06:41:21,169
Funko pups

1977
06:41:21,169 --> 06:41:23,169
Incredible hulk. What is this?

1978
06:41:23,810 --> 06:41:38,580
This is a movie incredible hulk. I only have one here

1979
06:41:41,700 --> 06:41:43,459
so strong

1980
06:41:43,459 --> 06:41:45,459
so strong

1981
06:41:46,020 --> 06:41:50,380
I don't remember this

1982
06:41:50,380 --> 06:42:00,819
What's that hulk versus wolverine? Why do they hate each other so much?

1983
06:42:09,580 --> 06:42:11,840
nice

1984
06:42:11,840 --> 06:42:26,180
nice nice nice nice pretty cool sick

1985
06:42:26,900 --> 06:42:32,860
This looks like a goro render. I feel like this is like a mortal kombat render

1986
06:42:34,459 --> 06:42:40,900
That's pretty cool

1987
06:42:40,900 --> 06:42:42,900
These are nice. These are really nice

1988
06:42:43,979 --> 06:42:45,500
That's nice

1989
06:42:45,500 --> 06:42:49,919
Stay away from my coco puffs

1990
06:42:50,080 --> 06:42:53,889
Isn't anyone of those commercials?

1991
06:42:53,889 --> 06:43:02,060
All right movie gallery

1992
06:43:02,060 --> 06:43:04,540
In-game movies. Oh the making of this

1993
06:43:07,500 --> 06:43:15,340
This is the gym that i'm going to show you this is the tool the designers use

1994
06:43:15,900 --> 06:43:18,139
I'm a designer. I want to say okay. Well, what's it like?

1995
06:43:18,700 --> 06:43:19,500
to

1996
06:43:19,500 --> 06:43:23,330
To play a good game kevin too easy too hard

1997
06:43:24,049 --> 06:43:27,169
What is most fun to the player the gym allows the designer?

1998
06:43:27,810 --> 06:43:34,369
To play with these numbers and encounters in a very easy way as an example like right now hulk's max charge jump

1999
06:43:34,930 --> 06:43:37,009
He goes to a height of 20 meters

2000
06:43:37,009 --> 06:43:41,970
So in this tool we can take that number and say bump it up to 40 meters from now

2001
06:43:42,049 --> 06:43:46,529
Holy shit a max charge jump and should jump twice as high. You know how old these computers are

2002
06:43:47,490 --> 06:43:52,770
I could bump it up to six down to one. I could do that. That was a blurred playstation controller

2003
06:43:52,849 --> 06:43:56,130
I did do a lot of the effects basically kind of builds up an effects database

2004
06:43:56,610 --> 06:44:01,569
That we use to blow up our props basically or damage them or make them smoke or make them light on fire

2005
06:44:01,970 --> 06:44:07,330
Anything that blows up or has fire flame smoke debris dirt. That's me nice

2006
06:44:08,930 --> 06:44:15,599
Obviously hulk won every effect took up a chunk of

2007
06:44:20,060 --> 06:44:27,700
Wait, hold on comics found 20 smash point hulk attacks. I did

2008
06:44:28,639 --> 06:44:30,639
2589 attacks. I jumped

2009
06:44:31,439 --> 06:44:35,810
3122 times I died 55 times

2010
06:44:36,689 --> 06:44:41,569
I caught 19 missiles. I weaponized 126 things. I did 100. I did

2011
06:44:41,650 --> 06:44:43,650
12114 combos

2012
06:44:43,650 --> 06:44:45,650
I grabbed 27 things

2013
06:44:46,110 --> 06:44:48,009
I got juggled

2014
06:44:48,009 --> 06:44:49,790
1471 times

2015
06:44:49,790 --> 06:44:55,020
I killed 731 people 43 police 138 soldiers

2016
06:44:55,639 --> 06:44:57,639
104 missile soldiers

2017
06:44:57,659 --> 06:45:02,060
15 transports 76 tanks 74 combat vehicles

2018
06:45:02,540 --> 06:45:05,340
53 gunships 11 strike fighters

2019
06:45:05,959 --> 06:45:09,740
152 infantry destroyers three titans

2020
06:45:10,619 --> 06:45:14,060
12 mrls's two capture wardens

2021
06:45:14,779 --> 06:45:16,779
through 25 soldiers

2022
06:45:16,860 --> 06:45:35,470
Elected 1100 stuff. Very cool. All right. That was fun. See you guys

2023
06:45:36,430 --> 06:45:42,419
Tomorrow do villain. All right, what are some of these codes to put in?

2024
06:45:42,979 --> 06:45:55,470
What are we gonna do tomorrow? That's a good question. That's a really good question. Actually

2025
06:45:56,189 --> 06:46:05,020
What are we gonna do tomorrow?

2026
06:46:15,250 --> 06:46:17,250
toontown

2027
06:46:17,250 --> 06:46:19,330
I don't think I can get toontown set up tomorrow

2028
06:46:20,130 --> 06:46:22,400
All right. What was another one?

2029
06:46:22,400 --> 06:46:29,180
It's easy

2030
06:46:29,180 --> 06:46:31,740
It's so easy. It's so easy

2031
06:46:32,299 --> 06:46:34,299
You can do it. It's so easy

2032
06:46:36,099 --> 06:46:38,099
toontown rewritten is already set up

2033
06:46:39,150 --> 06:46:43,419
toontown

2034
06:46:43,419 --> 06:46:48,930
I'll try i'll look at i'll look into it tomorrow. Well, no, we're gonna like I i'm gonna like

2035
06:46:49,569 --> 06:46:51,569
We're gonna like crash the fucking server

2036
06:46:51,970 --> 06:47:03,200
I'm gonna open up toontown remastered and the servers are gonna turn off. It's not gonna work out

2037
06:47:03,919 --> 06:47:12,770
I'm gonna do like an 80 minute stream delay. What was the suit one?

2038
06:47:23,200 --> 06:47:25,279
Did I I don't did I unlock this suit fit?

2039
06:47:44,240 --> 06:47:46,259
Can't do it character abomination

2040
06:47:48,349 --> 06:48:03,740
All right chase, but no, what was it smash five? It's like almost seven hours i'm going longer than I should be

2041
06:48:04,779 --> 06:48:13,659
Remember I told you guys that I I wanted to have streams capped at like six hours five to six hours max

2042
06:48:14,540 --> 06:48:19,229
Supposed to be moving around

2043
06:48:19,229 --> 06:48:21,740
Uh-oh

2044
06:48:21,740 --> 06:48:36,130
Uh smash five doesn't fit. What does it smash? What smash one five? It just gives me points

2045
06:48:37,009 --> 06:48:39,380
um

2046
06:48:39,619 --> 06:48:43,700
Is there another one?

2047
06:48:43,700 --> 06:48:45,700
Is there a is there one that's even worth doing?

2048
06:48:52,290 --> 06:48:53,650
Oh canada

2049
06:48:53,650 --> 06:48:58,080
Okay, oh canada and then cheese five and then but there's also retro

2050
06:49:07,840 --> 06:49:11,490
Canadian flag shorts, okay. Are they on?

2051
06:49:14,000 --> 06:49:15,200
transit

2052
06:49:15,200 --> 06:49:31,900
Start up the game, dude. I'm I gotta put these in

2053
06:49:40,590 --> 06:49:42,590
mass transit, okay

2054
06:49:42,669 --> 06:49:56,560
Um now what toontown t o n t w n. Oh, i'm sure that works retro retro what is that fit?

2055
06:49:57,360 --> 06:50:14,189

2056
06:50:14,750 --> 06:50:24,110
Which are what retro 64?

2057
06:50:30,979 --> 06:50:34,259
No, no, no, no, no, no just just retro 64. What?

2058
06:50:35,299 --> 06:50:55,340
I don't care. Let's play with abomination for 12 seconds and then end the stream

2059
06:51:04,180 --> 06:51:05,380
It's me

2060
06:51:05,380 --> 06:51:21,810
Thanks for watching everybody. Well, wait, wait, wait, hold on wrong one. I'm glad we sat there for that long and did that

2061
06:51:27,459 --> 06:51:29,060
See you tomorrow. I'm

2062
06:51:29,060 --> 06:51:33,939
I'm gonna pretend to think i'm gonna pretend to play toontown tomorrow, but it's not gonna happen. I can guarantee it

2063
06:51:36,779 --> 06:51:38,779
One server or two servers

2064
06:51:39,470 --> 06:51:40,750
That are probably

2065
06:51:40,750 --> 06:51:45,229
Just being rented for like less than 100 people to play on that because people really love that game

2066
06:51:45,229 --> 06:51:47,790
We want to keep it going which is very admirable and it's great

2067
06:51:48,590 --> 06:51:51,790
Uh, we're gonna destroy the whole thing and it'll be shut down. It'll be shut off in 10 seconds

2068
06:51:52,189 --> 06:51:59,360
So that's not gonna happen

2069
06:52:07,060 --> 06:52:09,060
I'm willing to give it a look. We'll see

2070
06:52:11,819 --> 06:52:16,139
Anyways, uh, let's do the bits and the subs fairly quickly here because I do want to get up

2071
06:52:16,779 --> 06:52:19,180
Don't uh, i'm going against my new rule

2072
06:52:20,560 --> 06:52:22,220
I said

2073
06:52:22,220 --> 06:52:23,180
uh

2074
06:52:23,180 --> 06:52:27,419
More stream days less stream duration i'm already breaking it because we're about at seven hours

2075
06:52:27,500 --> 06:52:29,500
It's probably going to be about seven and a half hour stream

2076
06:52:29,979 --> 06:52:31,979
I'm supposed to be doing this doctor's orders

2077
06:52:33,330 --> 06:52:35,250
Anyways killcon. Thanks for the three dollars germa

2078
06:52:35,250 --> 06:52:41,090
If you had the choice between banning the top 1000 chatters or selling your funko pops, which would you choose and why?

2079
06:52:41,889 --> 06:52:44,909
I would sell the funko pops because I don't give a shit about them at all

2080
06:52:45,650 --> 06:52:49,330
They're interesting little toys and I think they're cool. I think they're interesting. I would just sell them

2081
06:52:49,970 --> 06:52:55,020
Like immediately like like today. I would just sell them. I'll put them on the market right now

2082
06:52:56,270 --> 06:52:59,229
Hey fitty. Thanks for the thousand bits. Hey germa. Hey fitty

2083
06:52:59,869 --> 06:53:06,000
The jewish bro. Thanks for 540. Are you not doing the movie stream because manos the hands of fate is public domain

2084
06:53:06,560 --> 06:53:10,400
And it's so bad. It's good. It would probably be a certified germa recommends movie tall streamer

2085
06:53:11,360 --> 06:53:13,659
Um, it's um

2086
06:53:13,740 --> 06:53:15,500
I think everybody's seen that movie

2087
06:53:15,500 --> 06:53:18,639
It was on the list, but ever I think everyone has already seen it

2088
06:53:18,720 --> 06:53:21,840
I want to I want to watch public domain movies that i've never seen before

2089
06:53:22,400 --> 06:53:24,400
like the gorilla

2090
06:53:26,139 --> 06:53:29,900
I guarantee you none of you have seen the gorilla and I haven't seen the gorilla

2091
06:53:30,540 --> 06:53:33,279
I don't want to put on a movie that we're just like rewatching

2092
06:53:34,080 --> 06:53:37,150
All right, remember this one manos. Yeah

2093
06:53:37,790 --> 06:53:42,209
They don't almost all of us have seen it, but let's watch it. No, no, no, no, no

2094
06:53:42,369 --> 06:53:46,209
I want new fresh public domain content that you and I have never seen before

2095
06:53:48,430 --> 06:53:50,430
And I guarantee you there's probably

2096
06:53:50,430 --> 06:53:52,830
Less than one person that's seen the gorilla

2097
06:53:53,979 --> 06:54:01,790
In this chat fresh fresh content

2098
06:54:02,750 --> 06:54:04,349
That's the reason why?

2099
06:54:04,349 --> 06:54:08,270
Peaceful haley. Thanks for the 250 germa. How did the move go? It wasn't too much trouble

2100
06:54:08,750 --> 06:54:12,110
Also, I finally got a car almost 23 years old and finally getting a damn car

2101
06:54:12,750 --> 06:54:16,509
Next up is my own place. I feel like i'm going in slow motion when it comes to being an adult

2102
06:54:16,509 --> 06:54:18,509
That's not even not even remotely accurate

2103
06:54:19,310 --> 06:54:21,310
Hope auto is doing well. Have a good night. You're 23

2104
06:54:22,110 --> 06:54:24,110
Let me just let me just stop you there

2105
06:54:24,270 --> 06:54:26,349
Um, I didn't become an adult really

2106
06:54:27,520 --> 06:54:30,080
Until I was like 20 fucking six twenty seven twenty eight

2107
06:54:30,799 --> 06:54:32,799
You got a lot of time. Don't worry

2108
06:54:34,159 --> 06:54:36,159
23 is not

2109
06:54:36,939 --> 06:54:39,150
As old as you think it is

2110
06:54:39,150 --> 06:54:41,470
It's still extraordinarily young

2111
06:54:46,849 --> 06:54:48,770
He thinks he's an adult

2112
06:54:48,770 --> 06:54:49,970
I am

2113
06:54:49,970 --> 06:54:53,869
Yeah, you got plenty of time

2114
06:54:53,869 --> 06:54:56,459
Plenty of time trust me

2115
06:54:56,540 --> 06:54:58,540
Uh, uh the movement good

2116
06:54:59,310 --> 06:55:01,389
It just was talking about slow motion

2117
06:55:02,110 --> 06:55:04,270
it kind of went in slow motion just because of

2118
06:55:05,150 --> 06:55:07,139
how

2119
06:55:07,139 --> 06:55:10,740
All the coronavirus stuff. It's hard to do a lot of stuff hard to set up a lot of things

2120
06:55:12,130 --> 06:55:14,930
Just because of a lot of people had reduced staff

2121
06:55:16,209 --> 06:55:18,209
It was a very slow move

2122
06:55:18,209 --> 06:55:25,680
It's okay

2123
06:55:25,680 --> 06:55:27,040
It is

2124
06:55:27,040 --> 06:55:32,270
Done. We are here

2125
06:55:32,270 --> 06:55:34,270
Yeah, thanks for the 250

2126
06:55:34,569 --> 06:55:35,950
Unkey

2127
06:55:36,430 --> 06:55:40,110
Phil thanks for the five dollars. Would you stream pac-man world for the game cube?

2128
06:55:40,990 --> 06:55:45,180
I mean, I love pac-man. So you you can't you don't have to do much to convince me

2129
06:55:45,580 --> 06:55:48,619
There's not a whole lot of arm twisting to get me to play a pac-man game

2130
06:55:49,680 --> 06:55:52,639
Even though I think I played one pac-man game in six years

2131
06:55:53,360 --> 06:55:55,360
Still you don't have to twist my arm that hard

2132
06:55:55,360 --> 06:55:58,639
And the one pac-man game that I played in six years was not even a pac-man game

2133
06:55:58,959 --> 06:56:02,720
It was pac-man was in the game. It was smash brothers for the wii u

2134
06:56:03,360 --> 06:56:04,479
so

2135
06:56:04,479 --> 06:56:06,080
Maybe you have to go even longer

2136
06:56:06,080 --> 06:56:13,729
Thanks a lot rick bilby. Thanks for the four dollars germany your streams are an escape and without them

2137
06:56:13,729 --> 06:56:15,250
I would be in a worse place

2138
06:56:15,250 --> 06:56:20,529
Please don't buy any more funko pops or i'll have to make a reddit account. Don't worry. I have bought I had

2139
06:56:21,490 --> 06:56:23,490
If I bought funko pops who gives a shit

2140
06:56:23,569 --> 06:56:27,330
But I didn't all the things on the shelf that you see behind you were purchased

2141
06:56:28,049 --> 06:56:30,049
As of about three years ago

2142
06:56:31,020 --> 06:56:39,220
Not purchased a funko pop in three years. It's time to get over it. It's time to get over this guys

2143
06:56:41,250 --> 06:56:43,250
Uh crump. Oh crumpo

2144
06:56:44,380 --> 06:56:46,220
Thank you crumpo for the 15 dollars

2145
06:56:46,220 --> 06:56:49,900
I think that burger joke should be on the nominations for best joke with more than five minutes to set up

2146
06:56:50,299 --> 06:56:52,540
As I feel like your entire life was set up for that joke

2147
06:56:53,180 --> 06:56:55,540
I don't I disagree

2148
06:56:55,540 --> 06:57:01,099
Does it I completely disagree?

2149
06:57:03,279 --> 06:57:05,279
It wasn't a worst or best

2150
06:57:05,279 --> 06:57:09,860
It was a setup. We were trying to we were setting up everybody

2151
06:57:10,860 --> 06:57:12,860
Thanks for the 15 dollars. It's a lot of money

2152
06:57:13,680 --> 06:57:19,680
Shibiririririru. Ah, thanks for the three dollars. See the secret is a great home cooked burger is a well oiled

2153
06:57:20,080 --> 06:57:24,080
Real hot cast iron skillet get your well seasoned meat. Hopefully 80 20

2154
06:57:24,720 --> 06:57:26,479
and stick it

2155
06:57:26,479 --> 06:57:29,279
In the skillet then smash it down with a spatula until it's thin

2156
06:57:29,680 --> 06:57:32,560
You cook in a few minutes and be extremely delicious. You forgot to say flip it

2157
06:57:33,119 --> 06:57:38,639
I didn't hear you say flip the burger. So I just didn't flip it and in a few minutes. I have half of raw burger

2158
06:57:40,930 --> 06:57:43,169
Not a good you got be specific

2159
06:57:43,729 --> 06:57:53,220
Thanks for the recipe mono cucumber. Thanks for 258 germ. I've been able to catch a lot more streams lately

2160
06:57:53,779 --> 06:57:56,659
Streams and videos really help me keep sane in the lockdown. So thank you

2161
06:57:57,220 --> 06:58:02,580
Anyways, I recently was playing around with some parts. I built a lego germa with multiple hairs for your variations

2162
06:58:03,299 --> 06:58:08,180
Those are included parts guide in case you or someone in chat wanted to build one for yourselves

2163
06:58:14,459 --> 06:58:16,459
With the nightwing shirt

2164
06:58:23,680 --> 06:58:28,259
Take a look at that. I'll show this one here. This is the most important one

2165
06:58:29,220 --> 06:58:31,380
This is the most important one for sure. Look at this

2166
06:58:40,580 --> 06:58:42,819
How would they both the bazooka image? I don't understand

2167
06:58:46,240 --> 06:58:59,599
I just saved it as this

2168
06:58:59,599 --> 06:59:06,540
Here we go

2169
06:59:06,540 --> 06:59:11,580
The hair is pretty accurate. The bottom right hair is perfect top left hair is perfect

2170
06:59:17,020 --> 06:59:19,020
Is that that's actual lego?

2171
06:59:20,220 --> 06:59:31,360
Serial numbers

2172
06:59:32,479 --> 06:59:42,349
I don't think legos do cereal. No like the serial number

2173
06:59:48,860 --> 06:59:53,340
This is such like a high quality photo. I feel like this should be a like a profile picture somewhere for me

2174
06:59:54,430 --> 06:59:56,430
But if you have a lego profile picture

2175
06:59:56,909 --> 06:59:58,669
I don't know if I want to do that

2176
06:59:58,669 --> 07:00:10,159
Oh look, it's auto

2177
07:00:10,159 --> 07:00:13,200
And down. All right. All right. All right. All right

2178
07:00:14,560 --> 07:00:16,560
You don't use twitter. Anyways, no, I don't

2179
07:00:16,639 --> 07:00:19,310
That's a very accurate statement

2180
07:00:19,310 --> 07:00:21,950
Thanks for the legos and there you go. You guys have the pieces if you want to make your own

2181
07:00:22,750 --> 07:00:24,590
uh lego germa

2182
07:00:24,590 --> 07:00:29,310
I feel like I don't know to like to burn or something to be like a voodoo doll and try to hurt me on whatever

2183
07:00:29,310 --> 07:00:31,310
You guys are gonna do with that

2184
07:00:31,630 --> 07:00:34,779
Thanks for the 250

2185
07:00:34,779 --> 07:00:36,779
Uh, sir canine. Thanks for the 250

joke

2190
07:00:56,110 --> 07:00:59,470
For the purpose of not spoiling what this could be i'm gonna look at this first

2191
07:01:00,029 --> 07:01:08,779
No, no, no, no, no, no

2192
07:01:08,779 --> 07:01:15,470
Uh, you just gave I just got an idea. Um, I think all the shark tank people do cameos

2193
07:01:16,669 --> 07:01:20,349
What if I just pay them all a ton of fucking money, whatever their cameos are

2194
07:01:21,229 --> 07:01:24,349
And have them just react to my shitty shark tank presentation

2195
07:01:28,700 --> 07:01:33,259
Each one of them i'll just have yeah. Okay. Can you can you talk about like my new my new product?

And get them to give me like 60 seconds and like edit a bunch of shit so they I can play

2197
07:01:39,020 --> 07:01:44,060
On like a little device or something in my hand different clips from each one of the sharks while I do my presentation

2198
07:01:44,060 --> 07:01:48,950
And we'll just have like like six cell phones set up with they're like facetime

2199
07:01:49,509 --> 07:01:59,009
Forward, I know at least three or four of them do cameos. I'm certain of it

2200
07:02:02,520 --> 07:02:04,520
Pay them to pretend to love it

2201
07:02:06,880 --> 07:02:10,000

Damon is 199. All right, damon

Hey lemon, thanks for the five dollars. I'm not sure how long you've been playing

2280
07:08:08,900 --> 07:08:13,060
But do you know that you can charge your nest jump while in midair, right?

2281
07:08:16,040 --> 07:08:18,599
Yeah, I i'll just hold it down

2282
07:08:19,159 --> 07:08:22,520
You hold it down. You let it go hold down. Let go hold down. Let go. Yeah. Oh, yeah

2283
07:08:23,599 --> 07:08:27,000
Yeah, I did. Thanks for the five dollars. Thanks for the tip

2284
07:08:27,639 --> 07:08:33,569
Peaceful. Haley. Thanks for 250. Hi again. Just notice the stream title. Please replace huge and strong with I am

2285
07:08:34,369 --> 07:08:35,330
Thank you

2286
07:08:35,330 --> 07:08:42,790
Everybody knows that already though. My friend just showed me the mega milk picture

2287
07:08:43,880 --> 07:08:45,159
unfriend him

2288
07:08:45,159 --> 07:08:58,790
for her

2289
07:09:00,919 --> 07:09:05,979
Hey sikilos, thanks for the 250. Jeremiah. I just finished watching the first eight seasons of caribbeanthusiasm

2290
07:09:06,619 --> 07:09:10,060
Thanks to you recommending it at the start of a stream a few months ago

2291
07:09:11,639 --> 07:09:16,520
Yep, you got any other suggestions for me lots of love mom

2292
07:09:18,380 --> 07:09:20,380
I'm so glad you watched it

2293
07:09:20,860 --> 07:09:24,540
What a fantastic show what a perfect every episode is perfect

2294
07:09:26,470 --> 07:09:28,470
Uh, sure. I have a comedy

2295
07:09:29,500 --> 07:09:36,650
Um, I haven't caught up with the last few seasons the last maybe two or three seasons, but silicon valley is was hilarious

2296
07:09:37,209 --> 07:09:39,029
It's a mike judge

2297
07:09:39,029 --> 07:09:43,669
Brand show mike judge if you don't know is the guy responsible for beavis and butthead an office space

2298
07:09:44,709 --> 07:09:48,700
And it's hilarious

2299
07:09:48,700 --> 07:09:49,659
really

2300
07:09:49,659 --> 07:09:51,819
Smart well-written show is really funny

2301
07:09:52,619 --> 07:09:58,060
Uh, yeah, people are saying always sunny in philadelphia. That's another fantastic show where almost every episode is perfect

2302
07:09:58,700 --> 07:10:02,490
The exceptions are maybe a few but you can't everything can't be perfect

2303
07:10:03,209 --> 07:10:10,439
We already went over that earlier

2304
07:10:10,439 --> 07:10:13,349
prairieland park boys, you know

2305
07:10:13,349 --> 07:10:16,150
I can't say yes to that because i've seen

2306
07:10:17,029 --> 07:10:20,790
Like six or seven episodes of trailer park boys and it was like it was funny it was

2307
07:10:21,509 --> 07:10:22,869
but I just

2308
07:10:22,869 --> 07:10:25,029
I didn't I didn't I didn't watch anymore

2309
07:10:26,009 --> 07:10:32,020
Not because I didn't think it was any good

2310
07:10:32,020 --> 07:10:34,340
But I I didn't grab me hard

2311
07:10:34,659 --> 07:10:39,860
The one thing that I didn't think was really funny and they stuck with this for from my understanding almost the entire show

2312
07:10:41,029 --> 07:10:43,029
Is the guy not ricky?

2313
07:10:43,590 --> 07:10:47,349
And not not not and not this guy either not bobbles. Who's the other guy?

2314
07:10:48,310 --> 07:10:51,529
The guy that just always had a drink in his hand julian. Yeah

2315
07:10:52,250 --> 07:10:53,049
julian

2316
07:10:53,049 --> 07:10:56,090
Broke the course of the whole show and they they ran with this forever

2317
07:10:56,900 --> 07:11:01,939
There's every time he's on camera. He has a drink in his hand like a whiskey and coke

2318
07:11:03,020 --> 07:11:10,259
Every single scene he's in every single fucking episode. It's just that's absolutely hysterical

2319
07:11:13,340 --> 07:11:18,700
That is by far one of the funniest things I've I you could ever do and to keep that going

2320
07:11:19,180 --> 07:11:21,419
It's just ridiculous

2321
07:11:21,580 --> 07:11:26,619
Why is that but he's so my purpose would be so painful to do after even one season

2322
07:11:30,520 --> 07:11:34,119
Even after a car crash he was in a car crash

2323
07:11:34,840 --> 07:11:39,639
Wait, he got he was at a in a car crash and then going to the hospital. What?

2324
07:11:46,569 --> 07:11:48,409
Uh, maybe I

2325
07:11:48,409 --> 07:11:50,409
Should I give that show another chance?

2326
07:11:51,659 --> 07:11:54,700
He crawled out of the wrecked car with with a drink in his hand

2327
07:11:56,979 --> 07:12:00,439
I can't believe that they kept that going and it did under any circumstance

2328
07:12:07,310 --> 07:12:12,029
Yeah, I mean it was I I chuckled. I thought it was funny. I thought it was smart and interesting

2329
07:12:12,830 --> 07:12:15,709
But I just never grabbed on top of it and grabbed it

2330
07:12:16,349 --> 07:12:18,360
I never grabbed me in the head

2331
07:12:18,360 --> 07:12:20,360
But maybe i'll give it another chance. It was funny

2332
07:12:21,919 --> 07:12:27,759
Hey mick mussels. Thanks for the thousand bits feeling generous. Love you germa and chat

2333
07:12:28,939 --> 07:12:30,380
And you you too

2334
07:12:30,380 --> 07:12:38,520
Hey lm man. Thanks for the three dollars germa gorge your hatred embrace your rage on chat. I already did

2335
07:12:40,189 --> 07:12:41,150
you

2336
07:12:41,150 --> 07:12:43,150
You had to have been there when I did the

2337
07:12:43,630 --> 07:12:46,590
The if you put a link in the chat, you're gonna get timed up in 10 minutes

2338
07:12:47,150 --> 07:12:53,180
That was unleashing a lot of people got timed up

2339
07:12:54,279 --> 07:12:56,119
And again lm man. Thanks for four dollars germa

2340
07:12:56,119 --> 07:13:02,200
I gifted 10 community subs yesterday because the day before that I promised to myself that if auto was better by tomorrow

2341
07:13:02,939 --> 07:13:06,330
I would give subs

2342
07:13:06,330 --> 07:13:10,240
Thanks a lot. That means a lot

2343
07:13:10,479 --> 07:13:12,479
He's doing good. He's actually doing really good now

2344
07:13:13,680 --> 07:13:16,000
His antibiotic stint is over

2345
07:13:17,229 --> 07:13:19,869
And he seems to be back to normal

2346
07:13:20,430 --> 07:13:22,729
But I am going to go to the vet

2347
07:13:23,049 --> 07:13:23,849
uh

2348
07:13:23,849 --> 07:13:25,930
A day or two from now probably on monday or tuesday

2349
07:13:27,229 --> 07:13:29,229
To just do a recheck

2350
07:13:29,470 --> 07:13:32,029
Maybe just talk to the vet again and say hey it's been

2351
07:13:32,750 --> 07:13:34,669
Been on the antibiotics for a week

2352
07:13:34,669 --> 07:13:35,790
He's better

2353
07:13:35,790 --> 07:13:39,200
Is there anything else you want to do?

2354
07:13:39,200 --> 07:13:42,959
But he is seems like he's fine. That's really good. I'm really glad to see that

2355
07:13:44,409 --> 07:13:49,849
Thank you. Hey yoda 985. Thanks for the 250 for your information. Mr. Streamer. My username is in a short joke

2356
07:13:50,409 --> 07:13:52,959
But i'll change it if it makes you upset is not

2357
07:13:55,659 --> 07:14:01,419
Yoda 985 is not a your short joke. That's i'm surprised by that. I'll be honest with you

2358
07:14:01,900 --> 07:14:17,080
I you know how many photoshops of yoda with my face green on it i've seen at least a handful of times i've seen um

2359
07:14:19,040 --> 07:14:21,610
mini me and yoda

2360
07:14:21,610 --> 07:14:25,770
At least a dozen times in the last year. So sorry for jumping to that conclusion

2361
07:14:26,569 --> 07:14:28,569
You keep that name. You don't have to change it. It's your name

2362
07:14:31,229 --> 07:14:34,029
a g m egon thanks to five dollars

2363
07:14:34,590 --> 07:14:39,849
Remember you can't keep moving forever. The police will find you one day and take you back to boston for the santa trial

2364
07:14:40,490 --> 07:14:47,099
Also, thank you for providing entertainment right now. I'm an essential worker and it's been stressful very stressful out there

2365
07:14:47,740 --> 07:14:50,700
Your streams are a highlight of my day and they give me something to laugh to

2366
07:14:51,819 --> 07:14:53,040
Yes

2367
07:14:53,040 --> 07:14:54,799
I need a new trailer

2368
07:14:54,799 --> 07:14:56,799
Lady for the rumble or ladder match

2369
07:14:58,439 --> 07:15:01,020
Because we got all right. We're gonna talk about this

2370
07:15:03,159 --> 07:15:05,659
We i'm going to hold

2371
07:15:06,220 --> 07:15:11,639
For the first time ever and this is a big change and a lot of people might not want to see this change

2372
07:15:11,720 --> 07:15:13,959
but a lot of people might be happy about this

2373
07:15:15,599 --> 07:15:17,599
I think we're going to do

2374
07:15:18,490 --> 07:15:21,099
a

2375
07:15:21,099 --> 07:15:23,020
Almost like a nomination

2376
07:15:23,020 --> 07:15:24,299
for characters

2377
07:15:24,299 --> 07:15:29,340
And not a nomination for characters, but like a wish list that a lot because i'll be very honest

2378
07:15:29,900 --> 07:15:33,419
The last time we did a rumble typically they would happen once every

2379
07:15:33,979 --> 07:15:37,759
Seven or eight months once every like once a year because it's been so long

2380
07:15:39,720 --> 07:15:43,080
It's been almost a year and a half or so since the last one right at least

2381
07:15:43,720 --> 07:15:45,720
13 14 15 months

2382
07:15:46,040 --> 07:15:47,799
There's a lot of characters

2383
07:15:47,799 --> 07:15:54,009
There's a lot of people that have been on streams and little jokes that have been made tons of them and

2384
07:15:54,409 --> 07:15:56,409
It's been a long time since the last rumble

2385
07:15:56,919 --> 07:15:58,599
So what i'm probably going to do

2386
07:15:58,599 --> 07:16:03,880
Is once it gets closer to the boston marathon we can actually really lock that all in and that it's

2387
07:16:04,279 --> 07:16:10,759
We're hopefully back to normal by september or at least somewhat normal normal enough to do the marathon

2388
07:16:10,759 --> 07:16:17,610
I guess i'm saying open up a wish list where on the discord or something

2389
07:16:17,610 --> 07:16:21,919
We'll have a channel where we'll just make a big list and then from that list

2390
07:16:23,400 --> 07:16:27,560
But potentially I will go through and pick out characters that I think I would like to make

2391
07:16:28,830 --> 07:16:30,909
Or we can even pick them ourselves on stream

2392
07:16:31,599 --> 07:16:37,049
But I don't think I want to do that with everybody because I think some of the fun at least for me is making characters

2393
07:16:37,049 --> 07:16:40,939
You don't know that are going to show up

2394
07:16:42,270 --> 07:16:47,470
So you guys knowing all the entrants to me in all the matches I think is I don't really like that

2395
07:16:47,869 --> 07:16:52,159
As much as I could so maybe at least a wish list and then

2396
07:16:52,639 --> 07:16:57,439
Maybe at least bring in five to ten people that chat really wanted and then i'll just make the rest

2397
07:16:57,680 --> 07:17:05,919
That's kind of the idea but thanks for the five dollars

2398
07:17:06,479 --> 07:17:14,959
And take care of yourself being an essential worker right now is very stressful. I can imagine thanks to the five bucks

2399
07:17:16,720 --> 07:17:19,279
Five dollars from tj the duke. Thanks for the five bucks

2400
07:17:19,279 --> 07:17:23,919
I used to watch your old tf2 vids back in 2012 to 14 got me through some tough times

2401
07:17:24,409 --> 07:17:28,009
That has recently looked you up for some nostalgia and it's good to see you're still doing your thing

2402
07:17:30,509 --> 07:17:38,490
Yeah, we're still going not playing really team fortress anymore, but still going still just hanging out

2403
07:17:38,569 --> 07:17:47,529
Trying to have a good time a few days a week. I see no reason to stop

2404
07:17:48,990 --> 07:17:57,020
Thanks to five bucks and welcome back killcon. Thanks for five dollars german

2405
07:17:57,020 --> 07:18:00,669
Did you know that plants while plants do not have nerves?

2406
07:18:01,150 --> 07:18:06,270
They have calcium gated networks that use glutamate to propagate information across their bodies

2407
07:18:07,040 --> 07:18:13,049
We've observed that this system is functionally identical to a nervous system and plants not only sense things

2408
07:18:13,049 --> 07:18:16,970
But also learn it's an entire rabbit hole of mounting evidence

2409
07:18:17,450 --> 07:18:24,360
In support of plant cognition where plants are as aware and intelligent as animals. Isn't that just quacking crazy?

2410
07:18:24,439 --> 07:18:27,639
What are your thoughts on that?

2411
07:18:27,639 --> 07:18:33,040
Uh, they terrified me. That's the scariest thing i've ever heard because if plants can become

2412
07:18:33,840 --> 07:18:39,799
Completely sentient and we're all fucking we're dead. That's terrifying

2413
07:18:40,040 --> 07:18:50,490
Imagine if the trees got sentient if they didn't want what if they didn't like us they would come up

2414
07:18:50,729 --> 07:19:03,630
They'd find some like fucking toxin they'd find. Oh, this is um, that's uh

2415
07:19:03,950 --> 07:19:10,299
Yeah, that happened today. Uh, I think that's a thing that happened piece of fiction

2416
07:19:13,209 --> 07:19:14,909
anyways, um

2417
07:19:14,909 --> 07:19:16,909
That was

2418
07:19:18,759 --> 07:19:19,799
Shit

2419
07:19:19,799 --> 07:19:23,959
No, don't listen to anything. I'm saying just blah blah blah blah. Look at me. You're super stupid

2420
07:19:23,959 --> 07:19:26,759
He's going off on a crazy rant again, and he's crazy

2421
07:19:27,630 --> 07:19:34,459
Um, yeah, that's scary though weird thought thanks four to five for the three dollars

2422
07:19:34,779 --> 07:19:38,599
No message just three bucks volemy five dollars on top of

2423
07:19:39,340 --> 07:19:42,090
Uh, fucking fifty dollars

2424
07:19:42,169 --> 07:19:44,729
Let me get five thousand bits earlier

2425
07:19:45,740 --> 07:19:49,500
This is 55 total dollars tonight from volemy germa. You scanned me out of a link

2426
07:19:49,740 --> 07:19:51,740
so I demand that you play the

2427
07:19:52,270 --> 07:20:11,900
You've been known video to make up for it band links. That's all you get

2428
07:20:13,919 --> 07:20:17,200
Hey atlantius. Thanks for the thousand bits since classes are online

2429
07:20:18,830 --> 07:20:20,830
We have to type out responses from math

2430
07:20:21,549 --> 07:20:28,110
One of the answers was negative two and I immediately thought the teacher made a bad joke and laughed way too hard about it

2431
07:20:28,590 --> 07:20:31,549
Thanks for making our lives a little happier. Even when you're not there

2432
07:20:33,319 --> 07:20:36,919
Oh god

2433
07:20:36,919 --> 07:20:39,419
Minus two

2434
07:20:39,419 --> 07:20:42,810
That's funny

2435
07:20:42,970 --> 07:20:52,490
Well, that makes me happy. I'm glad to hear that the stream can permeate

2436
07:20:53,209 --> 07:20:55,209
into other places in your life

2437
07:20:55,529 --> 07:20:58,970
Hopefully in a good way and not in a bad way. I hope nobody actually is

2438
07:20:59,529 --> 07:21:01,930
What do you say say something really bad from this stream?

2439
07:21:02,569 --> 07:21:09,240
We're having fun. All right. Hey genie boy. Thanks for the 250 germa

2440
07:21:09,240 --> 07:21:11,959
This is my second time watching your stream last one was yesterday

2441
07:21:13,389 --> 07:21:16,200
Hey, what do you think?

2442
07:21:16,200 --> 07:21:17,470
thoughts

2443
07:21:17,470 --> 07:21:21,560
Let's hear him. I've been watching the videos for a little over a year. Okay. All right

2444
07:21:21,560 --> 07:21:23,080
So you're you're fairly new

2445
07:21:23,080 --> 07:21:27,900
I just want to say that your videos and now streams are giving me so much joy and have helped me through some dark times

2446
07:21:28,540 --> 07:21:33,659
I just got my tax return yesterday. So i'm excited to support you in these crazy times peace and love

2447
07:21:34,380 --> 07:21:40,270
Thanks for the 250 really hope that you take care of yourself

2448
07:21:41,229 --> 07:21:48,639
Most importantly you got your uh tax return

2449
07:21:50,330 --> 07:21:52,409
Take care of yourself. Make sure you're taken care of

2450
07:21:54,669 --> 07:21:56,669
Be very very low down on that list

2451
07:21:57,680 --> 07:21:59,560
And if you get there

2452
07:21:59,560 --> 07:22:02,189
All right, i'll gladly take it

2453
07:22:02,189 --> 07:22:04,009
Thanks a lot

2454
07:22:04,009 --> 07:22:06,250
And welcome to the streams

2455
07:22:06,250 --> 07:22:07,770
video watcher

2456
07:22:07,770 --> 07:22:15,340
Thanks a lot genie boy plop one down. Thanks for three dollars. They say thanks man. Thank you

2457
07:22:16,060 --> 07:22:19,759
Get the credits on the screen. Let's roll them

2458
07:22:21,180 --> 07:22:25,099
Seven and a half hours. I told you this was never going to happen ever again. And how long did that last?

2459
07:22:26,060 --> 07:22:27,259
uh

2460
07:22:27,259 --> 07:22:28,860
Um a week

2461
07:22:28,860 --> 07:22:31,659
Yeah, this this was never this was never supposed to happen ever again

2462
07:22:32,439 --> 07:22:37,000
I actually said that was it was never gonna happen again. I said there'll never be a stream more than six hours ever again

2463
07:22:37,639 --> 07:22:47,279
I was wrong

2464
07:22:47,279 --> 07:22:50,650
But well, hold on this

2465
07:22:50,650 --> 07:22:52,650
Okay, hear me out on this

2466
07:22:52,889 --> 07:22:55,930
the reason why this wasn't like a four to five hour stream today

2467
07:22:56,810 --> 07:22:58,409
is because

2468
07:22:58,409 --> 07:23:02,169
At around the four to five hour mark on the stream. I realized

2469
07:23:04,080 --> 07:23:06,799
I probably only have another hour or so left in hulk

2470
07:23:07,439 --> 07:23:09,259
Am I just gonna

2471
07:23:09,259 --> 07:23:12,060
Stop the stream and not finish this game

2472
07:23:14,110 --> 07:23:20,750
Right, so it's okay. I did say that there was never going to be a stream again more than five or six hours

2473
07:23:21,389 --> 07:23:24,520
But there are some exceptions

2474
07:23:24,520 --> 07:23:31,930
Like wanting to complete a game that I know I can complete in less than six to seven hours. There's some exceptions

2475
07:23:33,049 --> 07:23:43,849
That won't always happen though. But thanks again everybody for subbing. It means a lot. Thank you. Thanks for giving me money

2476
07:23:43,930 --> 07:23:49,049
Thanks for paying me money

2477
07:23:49,049 --> 07:23:51,229
Thanks a million times

2478
07:23:52,650 --> 07:23:56,990
Immortal draculich, thanks to the five dollars germa. Do you have any interest in playing the prototype series?

2479
07:23:57,630 --> 07:24:01,400
They're also by radical. They have a very similar feel to ultimate destruction

2480
07:24:02,040 --> 07:24:04,520
Yeah, I actually tried to play prototype a long time ago

2481
07:24:05,470 --> 07:24:08,349
And it didn't work. I couldn't get it to work. So i'd probably just get it for xbox

2482
07:24:08,990 --> 07:24:20,119
And do that or xbox 360 or something eventually we'll go back to it knife boy. Thanks for three dollars. Do a hulk impression

2483
07:24:22,540 --> 07:24:26,840
Thanks to the three bucks

2484
07:24:26,840 --> 07:24:31,720
Hey bug smoke. Thanks for five dollars germa toontown rewritten supports over a thousand players

2485
07:24:32,360 --> 07:24:36,840
And the servers have player limits specifically so that people don't overload and crash servers

2486
07:24:37,560 --> 07:24:48,299
Be a really cool game to see you stream really i'll see if I can get it to work. I'll try i'll try it

2487
07:24:52,169 --> 07:24:53,290
I'll give it a look

2488
07:24:53,290 --> 07:24:57,630
I can get it set up and get ready and do it by tomorrow then whatever what i'll try it

2489
07:25:01,040 --> 07:25:03,680
Thanks for the five dollars bug smoke and for the good tip

2490
07:25:04,560 --> 07:25:09,680
Mostly lost. Thanks for 250 put a one in chat. If you haven't seen manos the hands of fate. Well, this is also

2491
07:25:10,479 --> 07:25:19,599
There's also a lot of liars here

2492
07:25:19,599 --> 07:25:21,599
Seeing at least one liar

2493
07:25:26,700 --> 07:25:28,060
Me, no

2494
07:25:28,060 --> 07:25:33,119
All right, but but for for trial period

2495
07:25:33,360 --> 07:25:37,680
I want to watch something that I haven't seen and that a lot of people haven't seen a lot of people have seen manos the hands

2496
07:25:37,759 --> 07:25:39,759
Of fate, let's just be honest

2497
07:25:40,240 --> 07:25:45,840
I know that people think it's hilarious and people really like it. It's such a bad bad shitty public domain move

2498
07:25:45,840 --> 07:25:47,439
Right. Everyone says that

2499
07:25:47,439 --> 07:25:51,770
But a lot of people have seen it not a whole by comp by contrast

2500
07:25:52,569 --> 07:25:54,490
Shit little people haven't seen

2501
07:25:54,569 --> 07:25:58,639
The gorilla i've just given you statements that are accurate

2502
07:26:05,290 --> 07:26:07,099
funny monkey

2503
07:26:07,099 --> 07:26:08,619
We'll see how funny

2504
07:26:08,619 --> 07:26:16,220
Thanks to the 250 and thank you sir canaan for the 250. I can't wait to see purple hulk in revenger's end war

2505
07:26:16,700 --> 07:26:19,259
The forever glove is pretty cool, too

2506
07:26:23,000 --> 07:26:29,040
Um for some reason I thought I thought this was just an absolute gibberish sentence

2507
07:26:29,520 --> 07:26:37,659
I can't wait to see purple hulk in revenger's end war. The forever glove is pretty cool

2508
07:26:39,500 --> 07:26:42,060
Wait, is it? Oh it is it's like a joke

2509
07:26:42,939 --> 07:26:45,020
Right, like the infinity gauntlet

2510
07:26:45,659 --> 07:26:50,380
The avengers. Okay, it is. I don't know they they name so much weird shit these days

2511
07:26:51,419 --> 07:26:53,740
Like ultimate zombie avengers. I don't know

2512
07:26:54,380 --> 07:26:56,159
All right. It's a joke. Okay

2513
07:26:56,159 --> 07:26:58,159
Hey, mitchell. Thanks for 20 dollars mitchell

2514
07:26:59,340 --> 07:27:01,340
2000 bits

2515
07:27:01,360 --> 07:27:08,700
Thanks for the 20 bucks. Thanks for playing a hulk ultimate destruction germa. Glad you enjoyed it ridiculous as it can get

2516
07:27:09,259 --> 07:27:16,380
I played it too alongside the stream and the completion time difference may have been double digits, but I really enjoyed watching you play

2517
07:27:24,080 --> 07:27:29,200
Double digits as in like, you know, that's 30 seconds. That's that could be 10 seconds

2518
07:27:30,479 --> 07:27:33,439
So you beat the game 12 seconds faster than I did

2519
07:27:34,000 --> 07:27:37,599
All right double digits faster if toontown does not end up being a game for tomorrow

2520
07:27:37,919 --> 07:27:42,479
Uh, if it does end up being it it'll be a blast take care and have a great night, man

2521
07:27:43,040 --> 07:27:52,380
I'll try i'm gonna give it a real try. Thanks for the 20 dollars. And yeah, the game was fun. It was hilarious

2522
07:27:54,380 --> 07:28:01,180
Uh, thank you cubite for the three dollars. I sampled the gorilla for my lo-fi hip-hop ep you uncultured swine

2523
07:28:01,900 --> 07:28:05,740
All right. Well, we haven't seen it. I haven't seen it

2524
07:28:06,060 --> 07:28:15,200
All right, you are like one of five people that have seen that movie here. Hey blackout. Thanks for the three dollars

2525
07:28:17,310 --> 07:28:18,349
uh

2526
07:28:18,349 --> 07:28:24,349
Joey zio and at toontown are their twitterers with the head dev in the server the server capacity is 10,000

2527
07:28:25,069 --> 07:28:27,069
And originally had 4,000 active users

2528
07:28:27,709 --> 07:28:33,069
Him the tat man with 12,000 viewers was able to stream the game. So you should be able to go tomorrow. Okay. Well, all right

2529
07:28:35,979 --> 07:28:39,419
All right. Yeah. All right. I I I was under the assumption that it was like an old

2530
07:28:40,060 --> 07:28:45,500
Like pieced together project that maybe like a few hundred to a thousand people could do. I didn't I don't know

2531
07:28:45,580 --> 07:28:48,729
Is that popular? I don't know. Is that popular?

2532
07:28:49,450 --> 07:28:51,450
You can help with any configs

2533
07:28:52,110 --> 07:28:54,430
Well tomorrow around like three o'clock

2534
07:28:55,150 --> 07:28:57,549
I'll be here

2535
07:28:57,630 --> 07:29:01,279
Getting ready. So if there's something wrong

2536
07:29:01,840 --> 07:29:04,680
3 p.m pacific, by the way

2537
07:29:04,680 --> 07:29:09,400
I'll try to over that like from like 230 to like 330 is when i'm going to try to figure this all out

2538
07:29:09,880 --> 07:29:18,779
if there's any problems or any configuration issues, then uh, absolutely we'll ask in the chat, but

2539
07:29:19,439 --> 07:29:24,319
No, I mean if if somebody like tim the tat man can do it and not crash the server then we should be fine

2540
07:29:24,400 --> 07:29:26,639
Yeah, that's because I have

2541
07:29:26,880 --> 07:29:31,840
More less than half of the those numbers. So that should be fine

2542
07:29:35,180 --> 07:29:43,229
Guillotine senpai, thanks for the 250 new emote promise. It's not bernie pog and it's uh, oh they got the link got removed

2543
07:29:44,220 --> 07:29:53,040
All right. All links are banned. I forgot. Hey, i'm sorry. Thank you for the 250 though

2544
07:29:53,759 --> 07:30:00,639
Barry pk thanks for the five dollars combine the shark tank stream with the webcam stream then get them to film interview ask answers

2545
07:30:02,400 --> 07:30:06,959
Get them to film interview answers and have your responses at different angles. Just food for thought

2546
07:30:07,360 --> 07:30:09,759
I want to get those gears turning bernie pog

2547
07:30:10,880 --> 07:30:12,959
No, we're not we're not making bernie pog a thing

2548
07:30:14,590 --> 07:30:18,189
Get rid of the bernie pog thing in your head. We're not doing bernie pog

2549
07:30:20,029 --> 07:30:24,590
I've is no we're not doing that. Thanks for the five dollars door farine. Thanks for five dollars

2550
07:30:24,590 --> 07:30:28,270
Hey bub, I would like to request my favorite character for the rumble door farine the wolverine door

2551
07:30:29,560 --> 07:30:31,639
uh ask uh

2552
07:30:31,639 --> 07:30:36,490
Ask visceral concepts to make a game. That's fun. We'll see if that's possible

2553
07:30:37,069 --> 07:30:40,779
Thanks for five dollars. Thank you, sir canine for 250 chat

2554
07:30:40,860 --> 07:30:45,580
Not realizing the minus and plus twos actually affect germa's life span hunker s

2555
07:30:46,139 --> 07:30:57,150
Kind of scary if you think about it. Hey genie boy again. Thanks for 250. The stream was great

2556
07:30:57,150 --> 07:30:59,150
Also bugleberry for rumble, please

2557
07:30:59,389 --> 07:31:06,439
You should play lego star wars the complete saga a bugleberry was in the last rumble and he

2558
07:31:07,000 --> 07:31:11,479
Actually lasted a pretty long time. I'm sure he'll be back. He's a staple of this entire stream

2559
07:31:11,479 --> 07:31:20,650
Now he will definitely be a participant without a doubt in my mind. There isn't evil four. I plan on it

2560
07:31:22,000 --> 07:31:26,880
Slom.com. Thanks for three dollars. Hey germa eight year viewer first time bitgiver. Love your work

2561
07:31:27,630 --> 07:31:39,389
I'd love a good old happy birthday. Happy birthday slom.com. Thanks for being around for that long. That's eight years

2562
07:31:39,470 --> 07:31:48,830
That's a lot. That's almost a decade. That's almost 10 years. The 10 year anniversary is actually coming up sooner than a lot of people think

2563
07:31:51,340 --> 07:31:52,869
june

2564
07:31:52,869 --> 07:31:59,240
2011 was when the stream when the videos the channel started

2565
07:32:00,509 --> 07:32:06,060
So if june 2011 was the first video then june 2021

2566
07:32:07,159 --> 07:32:12,810
Is 10 years that's a 10 year anniversary stream from inside of a cake

2567
07:32:12,970 --> 07:32:25,400
We'll see what I do for 10 years, but thanks for the three bucks and thanks for sticking around and that is the end

2568
07:32:25,479 --> 07:32:28,520
I'll see you guys tomorrow for maybe toontown

2569
07:32:29,060 --> 07:32:36,299
Reloaded if toontown doesn't work, then we'll figure something else out tomorrow is going to be where I am going to follow my rules

2570
07:32:36,299 --> 07:32:41,659
For tomorrow, we're going back to like the rules which are like four to six hours

2571
07:32:41,979 --> 07:32:49,419
I just wanted to finish the hulk right at the very end. We had 250 from goo berry juice. Thanks goo berry juice

2572
07:32:50,619 --> 07:32:56,840
Hola, gerbacola. I really need to talk to you about this voice you do but the actual it's a band link

2573
07:32:57,000 --> 07:32:58,919
What the actual fuck is it supposed to be dude?

2574
07:32:58,919 --> 07:33:02,759
I see people in chat calling it double d from ed ed netty impression

2575
07:33:02,759 --> 07:33:07,869
But that shit sounds exactly like cow from cow and chicken sounds nothing like ed

2576
07:33:07,950 --> 07:33:12,279
And there's no way you watched cow and chicken as a kid. No one did so what's the deal with that voice?

2577
07:33:13,819 --> 07:33:20,400
um just run

2578
07:33:20,799 --> 07:33:23,439
Hold on like it's been that's been almost seven and a half hours

2579
07:33:23,439 --> 07:33:27,799
I can't do it cow and chicken was an amazing show charlie adler is is a legend

2580
07:33:29,049 --> 07:33:31,049
Charlie adler did every fucking voice on that show

2581
07:33:32,779 --> 07:33:35,119
Did you know that?

2582
07:33:35,119 --> 07:33:38,970
Charlie adler did red butt guy cow

2583
07:33:39,689 --> 07:33:47,470
And chicken now you have to be the top of your game to be able to do something like that

2584
07:33:50,509 --> 07:33:54,380
Uh charlie adler is one of those inspirations. It's like

2585
07:33:55,419 --> 07:33:59,500
Probably like in top five like how it inspired everything that I do

2586
07:34:01,319 --> 07:34:07,400
I love charlie adler's characters charlie adler when he goes like this and he's able to care

2587
07:34:08,040 --> 07:34:14,729
Like nobody can do it. It's only only charlie can do that. I'm speaking like only charlie, you know my buddy charlie. No charlie adler

2588
07:34:15,369 --> 07:34:16,169

2589
07:34:16,169 --> 07:34:19,959

2590
07:34:23,979 --> 07:34:25,740
He's he's

2591
07:34:25,740 --> 07:34:28,720
Ed big head

2592
07:34:28,720 --> 07:34:34,520
Uh, he's so good. I don't know how much uh work he's doing now

2593
07:34:37,439 --> 07:34:39,869
man

2594
07:34:39,869 --> 07:34:42,990
That guy modeled pretty much the whole way that I speak

2595
07:34:45,290 --> 07:34:47,290
jim carrey charlie adler

2596
07:34:48,569 --> 07:34:49,849

07:34:49,849 --> 07:34:53,869

2598
07:34:54,509 --> 07:34:58,090
charlie adler jim carrey

2599
07:34:58,090 --> 07:34:59,049

2600
07:34:59,049 --> 07:35:03,080

2601
07:35:03,400 --> 07:35:05,979
larry david

2602
07:35:05,979 --> 07:35:11,869
Larry probably larry david. I'm such a huge larry david fan

2603
07:35:12,599 --> 07:35:15,880
I would turn green if larry david walked in my room

2604
07:35:16,520 --> 07:35:20,919
I mean if I was at a convention and larry david was there and he's like, oh you want me to sign something

2605
07:35:21,560 --> 07:35:23,560
You i'd be like hi

2606
07:35:24,360 --> 07:35:26,360
I would just turn fucking green and be like

2607
07:35:27,000 --> 07:35:29,000
larry hi

2608
07:35:29,000 --> 07:35:33,529

2609
07:35:33,529 --> 07:35:40,110
I would it would be he's like my idol. He's like the I think he's the funniest person on earth

2610
07:35:46,840 --> 07:35:54,299
Anyways, don't put losers in the rumble, please. Wait, what?

2611
07:35:55,770 --> 07:35:59,049
Oh, you mean like the people that actually lost the rumble uh for a second

2612
07:35:59,130 --> 07:36:01,290
I was like, wait, I thought you're talking about larry david

2613
07:36:01,770 --> 07:36:04,009
I was like what the fuck did that what did you just say?

2614
07:36:06,970 --> 07:36:10,090
You mean like actually physically people that didn't people that lost

2615
07:36:10,810 --> 07:36:16,020
No, they have we have to have all right if if like john cena gets eliminated

2616
07:36:17,340 --> 07:36:19,099
As number 10

2617
07:36:19,099 --> 07:36:22,439
He's gonna be in the next run. That's like john cena. Nice job you

2618
07:36:22,759 --> 07:36:25,799
You know, you're one of the most popular people in the wwe, but sorry

2619
07:36:25,799 --> 07:36:29,080
You never get to be in another rumble ever again. You sit these ones out

2620
07:36:35,840 --> 07:36:38,540
No, you do like

2621
07:36:38,540 --> 07:36:40,430
five to ten

2622
07:36:40,430 --> 07:36:43,950
People that were in previous rumbles. They're the people that I really like characters

2623
07:36:43,950 --> 07:36:47,150
I think are really fun and interesting and then you do like 10 to 20 new ones

2624
07:36:48,189 --> 07:36:50,750
And then some people don't even participate in the rumble

2625
07:36:51,229 --> 07:36:55,560
It's probably like five to ten new characters that show up just in the matches beforehand

2626
07:36:56,509 --> 07:37:03,470
I really like that system

2627
07:37:03,470 --> 07:37:09,479
And finally the buzzer for real dough. Thanks for 250 germa. Wait, I got a link to some possible fixes for prototype

2628
07:37:10,119 --> 07:37:12,759
Is there a mod I can pass the link on so they can give it to you?

2629
07:37:14,000 --> 07:37:18,799
Yeah, give it to one of the mods if not, it's I probably will

2630
07:37:19,599 --> 07:37:25,759
Honestly, let me just we'll we'll we'll say this right now. I'll probably just get it for xbox 360 if it exists for it

2631
07:37:26,970 --> 07:37:30,889
Some of these old games are just so finicky and by old

2632
07:37:31,450 --> 07:37:37,849
Anything more than eight to twelve years old just it can be such a pain in the ass if it's on a console

2633
07:37:39,049 --> 07:37:41,770
I just have to put the disk in and it just works and it won't

2634
07:37:42,009 --> 07:37:49,040
Crap well this game crashed like three times this game had like two bugs and hard crashed. This is a disk

2635
07:37:51,049 --> 07:37:54,569
Thank you for forgiving me. Jeremy. Did I?

2636
07:37:58,139 --> 07:38:17,950
I'm that person up for 30 minutes. I can't like I can't like choke on water right now and spit it up

2637
07:38:19,369 --> 07:38:22,970
Guys, don't you understand the joke? The stream is about to turn off in like 30 seconds

2638
07:38:24,479 --> 07:38:36,240

2639

Wonderful wonderful rest of your night

2641
07:38:41,360 --> 07:38:46,650
Of course, I forgive them. Of course. I forgive you. I did just just

2642
07:38:47,369 --> 07:38:49,369
Just put the brakes on a little okay

2643
07:38:50,169 --> 07:38:51,770
Just put the brakes on

2644
07:38:51,770 --> 07:39:01,689
