1
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:07,540
Hello everybody. I don't want to scare you. That's why I'm talking really lightly.

2
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:22,629
Okay, so we're changing the game here. Let me just change this. So this is the closing shift.

3
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:30,230
This is requested. A game where you run a coffee shop but it's very scary or something. I don't

4
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:51,820
know. Haunted coffee shop? Closing shift. All right, is there an audio warning with this game? Is this

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:01:01,590
gonna- is this a game that's gonna scream and blow everybody's eardrums out? Or what? Gotta be careful

6
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:13,579
of this. It's not it. Okay. All right, let me put this over here so you guys can see what's going on.

7
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:39,879
I turn the lights off. This is closing shift. Should I make the lights off? I want me to dim this-

8
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:56,390
this one? Should I dim the ring light thing? What? Is it good? Turn off the VHS effect. I don't have

9
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:25,669
settings. Let me just move this. All right, let's go guys. New game. Oh no, I'll be late for work.

10
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:33,530
I should be on my- I should be on my car by now. DST, Tab, Shift, Run, Crouch, Inventory. Okay.

11
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:47,300
Well, that's- the sensitivity is so high. All right, graphics. Resolution, yeah. Texture quality,

12
00:02:47,300 --> 00:03:02,009
12 and a half percent. Why would it be 12? That seems really low. Couldn't it be 100?

13
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:16,759
What is it, milk? Like, milk percent? It's for the effects. Oh. Okay, hard and- SSR, overkill,

14
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:24,729
VHS filter, off. Yeah, that makes- I'll puke if that's on. Controls, yeah. Our general,

15
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:44,310
make sure this is good. Even lower? Okay. Refresh, it's changed. Okay, let's do it.

16
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:50,599
Do you drink skim milk? One percent, two percent raw or whole milk? Two percent.

17
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:54,360
Anything else is just- it's just- I mean, one percent's fine. One percent and two percent are

18
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,479
both. Like, why would you drink anything else? Whole milk is good if you- okay. No. You know what?

19
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:05,879
I had whole milk recently and it really tasted like- I don't know, it tasted like fucking meat.

20
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:12,409
It was weird. It tasted like beef, like meat. I didn't like it. I haven't had it in a long time.

21
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:20,250
All right, I'm gonna be late for work. I gotta hurry up. Leave apartment. Wait,

22
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:38,199
do I need to take anything? I think I'm good. Let's go. Well, you know the difference of one

23
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:41,480
percent and two percent were side by side. Probably not, no. But I could tell you the

24
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,959
difference between skim and one percent. I could tell you the difference between two percent and

25
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:59,639
skim. One percent at whole. I have to go to work. I think I need the sensitivity drop even more.

26
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:09,050
Has anyone ever had their mouse sensitivity further than here on every single PC video

27
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:20,629
game that has ever released? Ever. That has ever released. I don't think- I don't think so.

28
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:30,920
That's better. Mine is- it's always so, so high. Really? Is my DPI just all fucked up or something?

29
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:48,009
What the fuck was that? Was that a flashlight or anything? I thought that was a gun. Someone's phone.

30
00:05:48,009 --> 00:06:10,360
What do I do with this? Someone's phone. Use it? How do I use it? Enter? E? I need to go through-

31
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:31,079
no need to go through here right now. E. It doesn't do anything? All right, how do I get out of here?

32
00:06:31,079 --> 00:07:03,480
What do I just do? This is so dark I can't see anything. I missed it? Go to the car. Wait. Oh.

33
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:23,769
Oh, okay. Get in the car. How do I get in the car? E? Lights off. The lights are off! That's

34
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:44,470
the wrong car. Doesn't seem like it. Hold on. Run. Interact. Yeah, I'm clicking. Clicking. Click.

35
00:07:44,470 --> 00:08:01,449
Click. That's the right car. Yeah. Click. Am I supposed to be able to open this? I didn't get the

36
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:23,620
car key. Oh, come on. I can't see anything. I need the keys to the car. Okay. How far up was

37
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:34,980
my apartment? Is it all the way up? This one here, right? Dude, I don't know what apartment is mine.

38
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:48,919
Which apartment is mine? Wasn't it up here? He's going to- I don't know what apartment mine is.

39
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:59,820
Is it up another thing? Down a floor? I might need to put the phone down. I don't- How do you

40
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:13,289
put the phone down? Items in hand. All right. Tab. Left, right. Scroll. Space. Go back to the car.

41
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:32,980
People just f**king with me? All right. I'm- Somebody- What does it say? Look for a person.

42
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:57,320
I can't go that way. Find the owner. Give the phone to the guy. What guy? This guy- This guy

43
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:05,159
couldn't see this guy. This guy didn't exist. All right. Is it as dark for you as it is for me?

44
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:19,879
Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey, um, are you looking for something? Well, I found this. Give me it.

45
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:40,340
Welcome. I just want to test something. Oh, that's kind of creepy. I kind of hate it, but I like it.

46
00:10:40,340 --> 00:11:04,970
This is my car. Okay. Go to work. My car. I actually don't mind this because it's not

47
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:13,940
shaky and jittery. This is actually not bad looking. Open and close. Okay. So it's time for

48
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:54,409
work. Do I get an employee door? No reflection. God damn it. Okay. Put away my stuff and talk to

49
00:11:55,049 --> 00:12:15,259
Senpai02. Back room here. Sorry, I'm late. Be careful next time. I'm going to tell the manager.

50
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:27,750
Turn up the game volume. I'm very sorry. I'll be careful. Being careful is not enough. Tell me you

51
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:35,129
won't be late. Do you understand? Yes, sir. I will not be late again. You also messed up some orders,

52
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:40,570
don't you? If you have any trouble with the order, there are some tutorial videos for you. So look

53
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:47,110
through it. Okay. I'll take a look. Oh, and one more thing. Never know what's going to happen in

54
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:53,289
imaginopolis. If you ever need any help, just click me. Make sure to leave your phone in the

55
00:12:53,289 --> 00:13:05,159
locker. You better not be texting anyone during work. Yes, sir. That was so weird. It's like

56
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:15,049
somebody magnetized him through the door. Okay. Put my stuff away. A phone. Is that it? My car key.

57
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:24,460
Recipes. Ooh. Okay. Hot. Drip coffee is just coffee. A latte. I know all this. I already know

58
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:31,639
all this. Latte. Coffee and milk. Green tea latte. Vanilla syrup steamed milk matcha powder.

59
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:40,919
I'm drinking one of those right now. Well, not a latte, but all right. Easy. Caramel macchiato.

60
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:52,710
I don't even look. That is drip coffee, water, and whatever flavor the customer asks for. No,

61
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:58,649
sorry. That's an Americano. Whoops. Who cares? It's my first day. Americano is water and espresso.

62
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:09,860
I fucking got it completely wrong. Oops. All right. So cool. Chocolate chip chilla

63
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:17,990
peccino. Blended ice, coffee, milk, chocolate sauce. All right. Well, whatever. I think I know

64
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:32,460
what I'm doing. Corial video. Oh, we're already starting. Can I help you? Did you say chillas

65
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:36,779
coffee? I've never been to one of these fancy places before. I feel uneasy. There's something

66
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:43,059
strange about this place. My daughter seems to be a fan of this place and now I'm here. However,

67
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:49,779
uh, I'll leave the drinks to you. Oh, and I'd like to get two of them. Would you want a latte

68
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:57,590
and a coffee? Oh, that'd be just fine. It's really uncomfortable here. However, can you charge such

69
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:11,220
a price for something like this? Do you want a latte and a coffee? Order sticker. Okay. Coffee.

70
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:24,139
Coffee. Got that. Here's your coffee, sir. Thank you so much. And, uh, also you wanted a latte,

71
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:32,169
which is coffee and steamed milk. You got it. Okay. Coffee and steamed milk.

72
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:47,019
Ah, boulders. Where's the steamed milk? Isn't this right here? How do I turn this on?

73
00:15:51,370 --> 00:16:01,940
Just one moment, sir. How do I turn that on? No, I don't want ice in there. How do I turn the milk

74
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:20,789
on? I need milk. Oh shit. Okay. That's it, right? There you go.

75
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:26,620
What happened? Huh?

76
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:54,789
Okay. There's my steamed milk. There's my coffee. How do I put the coffee? How do I put the steamed

77
00:16:54,789 --> 00:17:07,930
milk in the coffee? Just click it. Does that work? I need the lid, but is that a latte right now?

78
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:29,529
I'm so confused. That is a latte, so I just need a lid. Where are the lids? Okay.

79
00:17:37,819 --> 00:18:00,420
Will you pick it up? I need to label it? Where's the labeler? Cold cup lids? I don't know. Does it

80
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:18,259
label? Sticker? It's in your inventory already. What about this thing? Okay, so I'm going to pick

81
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:24,460
that up if I touch that. Watch the tutorial on the computer. All right, we'll just sit there for a

82
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:47,079
minute because I don't... Okay. I can't click the computer. Oh, how do I watch the tutorial?

83
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:59,400
He's getting a zero star review. It's behind the computer. What? There's nothing behind the

84
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:18,730
computer. Just one minute, sir. I'm still working on this. Is it in here? Don't put a cleaning

85
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:29,160
product in the guy's fucking drink. Order sticker. Latte. That's not the latte. All right. Can I

86
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:43,430
throw shit in the trash? That's... I don't even know what that is. Is there a trash? All right,

87
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:50,470
clicking anything just picks it up. How do I throw this shit in the trash? Like, just throw it all

88
00:19:50,470 --> 00:20:00,099
away. All of it. Besides that. Throw the whole thing in the trash. Okay. Coffee. Coffee cup.

89
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:17,819
Hot coffee. Milk. There's milk. Steam the milk. Great. Put milk in there. Label.

90
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:34,259
Cover. Label. Bro. What the fuck is going on here? It's just gone. He left. What the fuck?

91
00:20:34,980 --> 00:21:16,950
Watch the tapes. What tapes? Oh my fucking God. Okay. What is that? Okay. That's how you...

92
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:31,589
Get this out. Hot drink tutorial. Yeah. Okay. Get the ticket. You have two tickets. Go...

93
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:35,190
I just was like, I'm out of here. You obviously don't know what you're doing.

94
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:42,869
Yup. That's what I did. Steam the milk. That's what I did. That's exactly what I just did. Take

95
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:48,920
the cup. Put it over there. Steam milk inside of it. What did I do wrong? Put the cup. Do it.

96
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:58,420
Put it down. Put a lid on it. And then put the coffee label on that. Okay. It just disappeared.

97
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:16,490
I did the whole thing right. Let me make sure I get this right. Yeah. You do cold coffee.

98
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:27,799
Or do you do hot coffee? Ice. Blend up the ice. Put the board in there. It's the shit

99
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:31,559
disappearing from your hand or disappearing and going into your inventory that's like freaking

100
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:37,559
me out. Do the whatever you want for those flavors. Put the bullshit in here like the

101
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:43,400
cinnamon twigs or whatever the hell it is. All right. I get it. Where's the fucking next customer?

102
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:53,660
I hope you're in the news. I hear stalker cases are on the rise. It's scary. Women like me,

103
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:58,819
you see, I have to be careful. All the guys are always staring at me. So careful too.

104
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:05,799
They don't have to worry as much as I do, but you should watch out either way. Dark mocha chip

105
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:17,220
please. Dark mocha chip. You got it. Dark blended ice, coffee, milk, chocolate,

106
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:32,180
blended ice, coffee, milk, chocolate. Okay. There's no ice in there. Ice. Cold cup.

107
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:52,039
Cold cup. Cold cup. Uh, coffee. Get that down. Put it with ice. Very nice. Okay. And we need

108
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:09,660
coffee, milk, chocolate sauce, and cocoa powder and milk. Chocolate, dark chocolate, right?

109
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:28,710
Where's dark chocolate? It's dark chocolate. Where's dark chocolate? I don't see a dark

110
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:37,480
chocolate syrup. I see chocolate. I'm making the wrong one. Just regular chocolate. Did it go in?

111
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:57,160
I never said dark. All right. Here you go. There you are. Thank you.

112
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:25,539
God, do I really need the ticket on there? Oh, come on. Enjoy. The powder makes it dark.

113
00:25:25,619 --> 00:25:41,079
This is too many orders. All right. Four regular coffees. A matcha cake please. Stop pushing me.

114
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:47,690
Salted caramel mocha. Then I'll have a matcha. Oh my God. You always can't finish your drink.

115
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:53,529
So let's share, man. Sure. Let's do that. One pumpkin cake. I think I'll have something to

116
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:59,769
eat too. You can order first. I'll have, um, hot cocoa. Hot cocoa. Are you serious? I don't have

117
00:25:59,769 --> 00:26:03,690
any money right now. You should have said that first. Come on. I'll buy you one. What do you

118
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:09,369
want to drink? Yes, but just say it. He's got money. No, it's not like that, but really anything

119
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:19,910
is fine. Uh, really I want a white mocha. Okay. Any food? No, just the drink. Come on. Let's order

120
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:27,769
some food. But, uh, okay. Uh, American waffles. Waffles. Uh, thanks. Both of you. Hey, where are

121
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:35,190
you looking at? Did you hear that noise? What noise? I didn't hear it either. Oh, it's probably

122
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:45,220
nothing. It must be your imagination. Okay. So, um, guys, I got a, a, a, what do you want?

123
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:59,849
I made up my mind. An apple pie. Apple pie. Um, apple pie. I'm just going to give you an apple

124
00:26:59,849 --> 00:27:11,369
pie and just tell you to leave. Apple pie, waffles, a white mocha, apple pie. Wait,

125
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:32,730
mocha cake. Pumpkin. No, I think it's this one because I don't remember the pumpkin cake.

126
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:45,289
Was there a pumpkin cake? I remember the American waffle. I think, no, it is this one. Wow. Can't

127
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:59,930
believe you remembered all that. We'll be waiting. Oh my God. Okay. Pumpkin cake, pumpkin cake,

Hey, I'm a private investigator. Did you spot anything suspicious around the area?

149
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:21,340
There have been numerous reports of people getting harassed. I was wondering if you've seen anything

150
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:26,820
in the store. Probably if something ever happens. Probably closing the store early.

151

Don't want to get in trouble. I don't want to get in trouble. I mean, we don't want to get in trouble.

00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:53,320
just my imagination. Are you haunted by any chance? Well, maybe I am. Uh-huh. Either way, I'm running

01:05:39,530 --> 01:05:55,929
What was that about? I don't know. Must be the stress of poverty. Poor guy. Get it?

I'm sorry. I'll have a vanilla latte. What the fuck are these guys? Vanilla latte and a latte.

263
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:40,869
I'm taking this TV out of the fucking wall and I'm overhead throwing it as hard as I fucking can

264
01:15:40,869 --> 01:16:07,449
into your head. You understand? I picked up my phone. Christ. Oh, Christ. It's the dude... It's

265
01:16:07,449 --> 01:16:25,800
the phone. You gotta be fucking shitting me. I'm telling you. I'm telling you. Fucking guy gets

266
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:31,060
a TV. I'm talking like Tom and Jerry style cartoon fucking style. You know what I mean?

267
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:55,060
Like it's going over my head and I'm running and throwing it. I don't want to open this door.

268
01:16:55,060 --> 01:17:17,420
Where's my phone? Don't I have a phone? Don't I have a phone? Where's my phone? I need a...

269
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:43,300
Where's my phone? Yeah, you gotta be kidding me. If there's another lady with like a baby carriage

270
01:17:43,300 --> 01:18:18,600
down here. Go, go. Get the fuck out of here. The car won't start. I have to take the bus.

271
01:18:44,260 --> 01:19:01,979
Motherfucker, don't jump scare incoming. Probably. I don't know. Bus stop. Wait for the fucking bus.

272
01:19:01,979 --> 01:21:05,829
I don't... I can't turn around. What? What are you looking at? What do you want? Give me one sec.

273
01:21:05,829 --> 01:21:13,939
Can I pause it? Yeah. Uh, I think Otto needs to go out. I can hear him. I'll be right back. This

274
01:21:13,939 --> 01:21:20,010
will be probably the last BRB of the night. I'll be right back. I can hear Otto. He just went...

275
01:21:20,010 --> 01:25:12,779
I won't be long. One sec. All right, I'm back. Yeah, he was just bored. He was just bored. He

276
01:25:12,779 --> 01:25:22,779
did a good look. I need a haircut. Go, Otto. No, he was just bored. He was just running around.

277
01:25:22,779 --> 01:25:47,739
Put my stuff away. Your hair looks good. I could use a trim. All right, so that... The guy was

278
01:25:47,819 --> 01:26:16,229
in front of the apartment. Where's the other worker? Where's the other worker?

279
01:26:27,289 --> 01:26:36,600
You scared the shit out of me. Leave me alone when I'm in the restroom. God damn it. Get to work.

280
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:51,989
Dude, I... I... Oh my god. What did you just order at the drive-thru, dude? You don't... Order like

281
01:26:51,989 --> 01:26:58,979
one or two... All right, I'll make you an entire like steak dinner and like eight drinks. I'll

282
01:26:58,979 --> 01:27:15,960
be right back. Okay, you want two American... You want two caramel macchiatos, two scones.

283
01:27:19,189 --> 01:27:38,199
What are they? American scone. American scone. American scone. Here's one. One, two, and then you

284
01:27:38,199 --> 01:27:45,909
want two... How do I make caramel macchiatos? Coffee... It's hot. Coffee, steamed milk, caramel

285
01:27:45,909 --> 01:28:12,140
syrup. Coffee, steamed milk, syrup, and sauce. Any milk? Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Caramel syrup,

286
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:19,979
caramel sauce. There's one. You need a fucking lid. I don't want you to have to carry the... Hey,

287
01:28:19,979 --> 01:28:31,300
what? Did we talk about what was wrong? What is that? How is that wrong? Wait, hold on.

288
01:28:33,319 --> 01:28:41,430
Coffee, steamed milk, syrup, sauce. I don't understand. It's iced. No, it's not. It's hot.

289
01:28:42,149 --> 01:28:55,590
Coffee, steamed milk, caramel syrup, caramel sauce. Coffee, steamed milk, caramel syrup, caramel sauce.

290
01:28:56,310 --> 01:29:11,350
Caramel sauce, caramel syrup. What's wrong? That was actually correct. You want the other one too?

291
01:29:12,149 --> 01:29:19,109
Okay. Yeah, of course you do. You ordered it. The one guy ordering the Thanksgiving dinner at the

292
01:29:19,109 --> 01:29:35,770
drive-thru. Just... Hurry, hurry, hurry. Come on, come on, come on, come on. He's gonna be pissed.

293
01:29:36,810 --> 01:30:03,609
What's happening? It's the milk. It's steamed milk, man. It's steamed milk. Milk. Milk.

294
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:26,779
Steamed milk? What's happening? How is that wrong? I have so many of these. I have so many of these

295
01:30:26,779 --> 01:30:50,170
in my elbow voice ever since I turned like 33. What do you want? Hi. How are you? Green tea latte

296
01:30:50,170 --> 01:31:03,210
and one of those waffles too. Can I even buy anything? Green tea latte and one of those.

297
01:31:03,210 --> 01:31:10,100
Oh, and one green tea latte and a waffle. Yes. The green tea latte and waffle here are delicious.

298
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:15,619
I always go for these too. Cool. Well, thank you for serving them. My son likes them too.

299
01:31:16,649 --> 01:31:21,560
Are you alone? I'll give you this if you like. This rosary bracelet is said to ward off evil.

300
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:26,489
You should keep it. I bought it from an infomercial on TV. They said something amazing about it.

301
01:31:27,430 --> 01:31:33,380
You can believe it for only 9900 yen. That's fine. I own a lot of them anyways. In this day

302
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:37,829
and age it's so convenient to buy things through the cell phone. There are only a few presses

303
01:31:37,829 --> 01:32:06,699
and buttons away. All right. Green tea latte waffle and a green tea latte is vanilla syrup,

304
01:32:06,699 --> 01:32:22,300
steamed milk, matcha powder. I don't even coffee. Really? Wait. Oh, I had steam blenders

305
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:40,329
in my fucking inventory and then matcha powder. Okay. There you go. Thanks for the bracelet.

306
01:32:40,329 --> 01:32:57,850
Appreciate it. Thank you. The tip jar. The phone. I haven't been able to use the phone the whole game.

307
01:32:58,569 --> 01:33:05,340
I can't pick it up. The whole time I've been playing I haven't been able to use the phone.

308
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:34,729
So Mr. Aren't you a cute one? Are you by any chance a model or something? No, nothing in particular.

309
01:33:34,729 --> 01:33:38,329
What a waste. I'm sorry, but you should definitely make use of that style you got.

310
01:33:39,319 --> 01:33:42,520
I mean, do you want me to introduce you to my office? Give me your number.

311
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:49,689
I'm not sure about that. I see. I don't care if you regret it. I'll have a salted caramel mocha,

312
01:33:49,689 --> 01:34:03,350
please. I'm trying to serve coffee at work. You know what I mean? All right. What do you want?

313
01:34:04,810 --> 01:34:14,140
Salted caramel mocha, coffee, steamed milk, caramel hazelnut chocolate sauce, caramel hazelnut

314
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:28,039
chocolate, caramel hazelnut chocolate, caramel hazelnut chocolate, caramel hazelnut chocolate,

315
01:34:32,119 --> 01:34:45,699
caramel hazelnut chocolate sauce. There it is. Here you are. Drink. Much see you later. See you

316
01:34:45,699 --> 01:35:04,970
later. I need to serve the customers. I already served everybody. Who's left to serve? Who's left

317
01:35:04,970 --> 01:35:32,069
to serve? I don't like how fast the shit moves. A shirt. Excuse me. Shirt. Okay. Yeah. All right.

318
01:35:32,069 --> 01:35:41,399
Yep. All right. Yeah. I didn't put enough of this. Okay. That's great. Cool. Very good.

319
01:35:45,479 --> 01:35:54,180
It's so hot today. I'll have a caramel chilapecino. Could you please put on some clothes and not make

320
01:35:54,180 --> 01:36:06,090
a scene? Yeah, come on. I won't be here for long. No, it would not. So legally that's out of the

321
01:36:06,489 --> 01:36:12,409
question. Wouldn't it be a disaster if a customer catches a cold? I'm trying to. I won't be here

322
01:36:12,409 --> 01:36:18,920
for long. No, it would not. So legally that's out of the question. Wouldn't it be a disaster

323
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:28,890
if a customer catches a cold? I guess this one. What? What are you worried about me? Thanks,

324
01:36:28,890 --> 01:36:36,090
but it's hot today. It would be nice if you would consider other customers. It's cold outside. It's

325
01:36:36,090 --> 01:36:51,050
one degree celsius right now. This guy's on drugs. It's freezing out. What? It's in a single

326
01:36:51,050 --> 01:37:08,520
digit? Yeah. Where's this music coming from? Okay. I'm going to say if I will get colder and colder.

327
01:37:10,869 --> 01:37:19,319
Now I only have clothes at home. Look, come back tomorrow when you're dressed. How does that sound?

328
01:37:20,199 --> 01:37:50,939
God damn it. I hate this. I hate this. Like this toilet. All right. All right. Oh, this is going to

329
01:37:52,300 --> 01:38:16,979
where's my stuff? What if this never gets scary and you just have to do this for 300 nights in a

330
01:38:16,979 --> 01:38:27,050
row? Um, why does that happen? I mean, it's already been fucking scary. It's already been

331
01:38:27,050 --> 01:39:42,439
fucking weird. Which trash is there? Is there a second toilet? Is it two toilets? Wait, wait,

332
01:39:42,439 --> 01:39:59,340
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, 14414. Whoa. Why is there? What am I making the coffee for? Um, hello. I need

333
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:08,470
to serve the customers. Give me a knife. Give me a knife. Give me a, give me a knife. Give me a gun.

334
01:40:08,470 --> 01:40:13,140
Give me something. I'm getting out the fucking drive-through. What do I do? What do I do? What

335
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:29,859
do I do? What do I do? What do I do? I can't leave. I can't open this. Oh shit. You need two lattes,

336
01:40:29,859 --> 01:40:48,340
two latte, latte, latte, latte, latte, latte. Oh, I already started. Why did it do that? Okay.

337
01:40:48,340 --> 01:41:02,060
One, two, hurry, hurry, hurry. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Stop it. Why is it doing that

338
01:41:02,060 --> 01:41:21,859
shit, man? All right. That's it. That's it. That's it. What the fuck is happening right now?

339
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:35,340
Huh? What's happening? What's going on? I have five seconds. I don't get it. What happened?

340
01:41:45,140 --> 01:42:04,819
Oh, run. Excuse me. What the fuck are you talking about, dude? I can't fucking leave. I'm stuck

341
01:42:04,819 --> 01:42:55,640
here. What's going on? What's actually going on? I can't do anything. Where's my bracelet?

342
01:42:55,640 --> 01:43:28,310
Didn't I have a magic bracelet? I didn't throw it away. Clean up. I think I'm stuck in here.

343
01:43:28,310 --> 01:44:16,970
I think I got, I got soft-locked. I think you threw it away on accident. No way. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

344
01:44:27,420 --> 01:44:51,340
That would have been scarier if I had actually, I had to walk down the middle aisle. Why are

345
01:44:51,340 --> 01:45:58,220
they demons? What were the demons? Dude, why are they demons? Holy shit. No more. This jump

346
01:45:58,220 --> 01:46:07,850
scare is right here. Don't do it. What does that sound? What is it? Okay. I'm, I hear shit going

347
01:46:07,850 --> 01:46:11,029
on right now and I'm just going to go. I don't need to, what do you mean I don't need to go

348
01:46:11,029 --> 01:47:02,699
through here? Pop the trunk. Fuck, entire iron. I don't even have any stuff anymore. My suspicions

349
01:47:02,699 --> 01:47:09,430
were true. Glad you contacted me. Calling the police won't help. All they'll do is brush things

350
01:47:09,430 --> 01:47:15,609
off to lessen, wait, when did I do that? And why are people like me? I'll take a look around and

351
01:47:15,609 --> 01:47:41,060
see if I can find anything. Did they call? Oh, okay. Hey, all the caramel mocha here is so

352
01:47:41,060 --> 01:47:46,329
delicious. I think you'll love it Senpai. Okay, I guess I'll try it then. One salted caramel mocha.

353
01:47:46,329 --> 01:47:55,350
I'll have a dark mocha chip chilapecino. You're not getting that? Yeah, I want to try something

354
01:47:55,350 --> 01:48:00,810
different today. I already had one today. I see, but a chilapecino is on a day like this. You're

355
01:48:00,810 --> 01:48:07,130
so young because it's so delicious. How would you like to pay your bill? Oh, is today the day of the

356
01:48:07,130 --> 01:48:10,810
photo shoot or something? Is the store going to be featured in a newspaper or something?

357
01:48:12,659 --> 01:48:18,680
No, I don't think so. Why? Well, I saw someone outside taking pictures. Taking pictures of the

358
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:25,420
store. The store and you most likely. I did my makeup. What are you talking about? I'm sorry,

359
01:48:25,420 --> 01:48:30,380
we'll pay together. The drinks are on me. What are you sure? Thank you so much Senpai. I'm in a good

360
01:48:30,380 --> 01:48:35,880
mood lately. My son used to be outed and this is a better, he's in a better mood now that he's

361
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:42,229
going to school. Son's in middle school, right? Yeah, let's hope he wasn't bullied at school.

362
01:48:42,949 --> 01:48:51,539
I didn't have any good memory when I was his age. What do you guys, what do you want?

363
01:48:51,539 --> 01:49:00,939
Why do I have all these latte tickets? I can't throw these away. Okay, chocolate chip,

364
01:49:00,939 --> 01:49:47,659
chocolate chip chilapecino, ice, coffee, milk, sauce, powder, and whatever. Ice, coffee, milk,

365
01:49:47,659 --> 01:50:07,130
powder, and syrup, right? Chocolate syrup. Okay, there you go. And the other one was a salted

366
01:50:07,130 --> 01:50:29,180
caramel mocha. Coffee, milk, caramel, hazelnut, chocolate, coffee, milk, caramel, hazelnut,

367
01:50:29,180 --> 01:50:56,810
chocolate. Remember, there are seven secret recipes you need to find. I feel like that's a

368
01:50:56,810 --> 01:51:31,270
lie. Where's the protective guy? Oh, it's the jump scare lady. How is this haunted? I mean,

369
01:51:31,829 --> 01:51:36,710
I just was being chased by like demons. I don't know. This is like a fucking weirdo.

370
01:51:36,710 --> 01:51:50,279
Salted caramel mocha. Salted caramel mocha is coffee, milk, caramel, hazelnut, syrup, hazelnut,

371
01:51:52,760 --> 01:52:08,550
caramel, hazelnut, chocolate. Cold or hot? I just made it, whatever. What is that noise?

372
01:52:08,550 --> 01:52:28,789
Not soy. Caramel, hazelnut, chocolate. What is that going on? You okay?

373
01:53:16,390 --> 01:53:31,560
That's strange. Oh, I'm sorry. Give me the usual. I don't know which one of these is. Can I throw

374
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:47,130
this shit away? I have so much. Okay, salted caramel mocha. Sweet red beans and butter bread.

375
01:53:47,130 --> 01:53:58,140
Sweet red beans and butter bread. What's sweet red bean butter bread? We don't serve that here.

376
01:53:58,140 --> 01:54:08,970
What the hell is a sweet red bean and butter bread? British food? Yeah, that sounds like a

377
01:54:08,970 --> 01:54:24,729
fucking Harry Potter item. Sweet red bean butter bread. What? I don't. Oh, we do own that. You

378
01:54:24,729 --> 01:54:32,569
wanted a salted caramel mocha. I know how to do that. I did that like five times already.

379
01:54:32,569 --> 01:55:07,859
Salted caramel mocha. It's caramel, hazelnut, chocolate. And you also want caramel macchiato,

380
01:55:07,859 --> 01:55:16,340
which I believe that's cold. It is. No, it's not. Coffee, milk, caramel, caramel.

381
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:46,579
There you go. What happened to my beads? Seriously, where'd they go? Are you repairing

382
01:55:46,579 --> 01:55:57,210
the store's antenna at this hour? No, ma'am. Why? I saw someone on the roof. There shouldn't

383
01:55:57,210 --> 01:56:01,529
be anyone on the roof. Who would be the investigator? Maybe I should check it out.

384
01:56:01,529 --> 01:56:09,770
Could have been my imagination. Anyway, the drink, please. Investigator up on the roof?

385
01:56:09,770 --> 01:56:17,130
The investigator is going to be like dead or something, right? It's going to be, I don't know.

386
01:56:17,449 --> 01:57:23,430
Something horrible. Should I put it or should I put the ladder on? You go up here with a

387
01:57:23,430 --> 01:57:32,470
fucking tire iron, climb the ladder and then pull the ladder up and fucking use it. You know what

388
01:57:32,470 --> 01:58:04,699
I mean? Like I'm like, I don't want to, I don't want to go up there without something. I go over

389
01:58:04,699 --> 01:58:25,539
there. Any reason that can I like jump? Why can I climb this? Yeah. All right. So what? I don't want

390
01:58:25,539 --> 01:58:39,159
to go in there. Okay. It's like, pick this up. These things are like probably fucking 25 pounds

391
01:58:39,159 --> 01:58:53,590
each. Yell down there. Detective, detective, are you down there? Detective? Brought that

392
01:58:53,590 --> 01:59:31,420
fucking thing down. Oh God damn it. I have to close the store fast. Unlock the door. Unlock the door.

393
01:59:31,420 --> 01:59:52,300
What? I gotta close the door fast. Gun. No. What the fuck? What am I, why am I taking all this?

394
01:59:52,300 --> 02:00:02,869
I don't understand. Why am I picking up all the food? Get the money. What do I do? What's going on?

395
02:00:04,409 --> 02:00:42,380
Why did I pick up every item in the fucking thing? Throw it all away? What else? What else? What else?

396
02:00:42,380 --> 02:00:49,659
What else is going on? Sandwich? Count product. One, two, what? I don't get it. Count product.

397
02:00:49,659 --> 02:00:54,439
Count product. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen,

398
02:00:54,439 --> 02:01:01,930
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen. Start over. Start over. Two, four, six, eight, ten. Two, four, six, eight,

399
02:01:01,930 --> 02:01:06,250
ten, eleven. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. I got twenty-one here. Twenty-one.

400
02:01:06,250 --> 02:01:09,380
Twenty-one. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. What do I do now? Twenty-one.

401
02:01:09,380 --> 02:01:14,810
Twenty-one. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. What

402
02:01:14,810 --> 02:01:35,109
do I do? Twenty-one. Gone? I thought that said police scanner. Okay, now what? What's left? What's

403
02:01:35,109 --> 02:02:10,010
left? What's left? Get money. Did I get it? Count the money? Goodbye. Okay. Fuck you. Fuck you,

404
02:02:10,010 --> 02:02:14,460
motherfucker. Fuck you. Pick up something heavy. Something that can fucking hit somebody in the

405
02:02:14,460 --> 02:02:30,500
face. Like a printer. Or where's my stuff? Room. I don't know. Is this locked? Oh shit, he's gone.

406
02:02:30,500 --> 02:02:43,159
He was at the drive-thru. He was at the drive-thru. He was at the drive-thru. Where do I go? Where

407
02:02:43,159 --> 02:02:52,489
do I go? Are these photographs of me? Screwdriver. I'm stabbing him. Screwdriver. This is fucking

408
02:02:52,489 --> 02:02:55,819
perfect. What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?

409
02:02:55,819 --> 02:03:00,760
Screwdriver. What do I do with the screwdriver? What do I do with the screwdriver? What would you

410
02:03:00,760 --> 02:03:05,399
open that door for, you idiot? Why would I open the back door? What do I do with screwdriver?

411
02:03:05,399 --> 02:03:20,710
What do I do with screwdriver? Where's the vent? Vent? Where's the vent? Where's the actual- Where's

412
02:03:20,710 --> 02:03:27,340
the vent? Where is it? I can't do that. I can't do that. I can't do it. I can't. I can't. I can't

413
02:03:27,340 --> 02:03:29,579
do that. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do it. I don't know

414
02:03:29,579 --> 02:03:44,899
what to do. I can't do it. I can't do it. Guys, I can't do it. Should I run to the car? Run to the

415
02:03:44,899 --> 02:03:56,390
car? Ladder. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Where's the fucking ladder? How do I-

416
02:03:57,430 --> 02:04:14,579
Look at all this shit I have. All right, shut this fucking thing. Shut this fucking thing.

417
02:04:15,220 --> 02:04:37,829
How do I close this? Brick? Okay, do it. Drop it on his head. Drop it on his head. He killed

418
02:04:37,829 --> 02:04:52,920
detective. All right, where is he? Drop it on his head. Crush him. Crush him with the brick.

419
02:04:52,920 --> 02:05:26,039
I got him. Yes. I got him. I told you. Fucking TV. Something heavy. Big crush. I ran to the police

420
02:05:26,039 --> 02:05:31,340
until, please, everything happened. Police took me back to the scene and that man was no longer

421
02:05:31,340 --> 02:05:46,020
there. There was no one there. Investigated the scene. Hired after that. Wait a minute. It's not-

422
02:05:46,020 --> 02:06:26,220
This is not over. I want to rest peacefully at home. Dude. Cable's acting weird again. Call the

423
02:06:26,300 --> 02:06:46,819
owner. I even- I bricked the guy. I bricked him. Where's my phone? Dude, I bricked the guy too.

424
02:06:46,819 --> 02:07:58,630
Really? What the fuck? Yeah, I have stereo sound. I know it's out here, but I don't want to do- I

425
02:07:58,630 --> 02:09:24,899
don't want to go out here. Where is it? Give me another brick. I still- I still have the-

426
02:09:24,899 --> 02:09:31,539
All right, motherfucker. You didn't think I still had a fucking broom? Honest to fucking god.

427
02:09:31,619 --> 02:10:35,380
Where is the- What? Where's the phone? Dude, I dropped a cinder block on his head. On his head.

428
02:11:32,939 --> 02:11:46,310
He played a little vampire survivors. Relax. He survived a cinder block, dropped 10 feet. Dude,

429
02:11:46,310 --> 02:11:54,810
your head would cave in. Your head would go- would go like this. You would have a dent. Like,

430
02:11:54,810 --> 02:12:12,300
you would crush your brain from- That was- That was fucking creepy.

431
02:12:12,300 --> 02:12:24,579
Remember, that's cartoon logic. Is it though? I mean, I don't know, man. If somebody dropped a

432
02:12:24,579 --> 02:12:32,489
cinder block from like 10 feet in the air on your head, I don't think you're gonna make it.

433
02:12:32,489 --> 02:13:04,579
I don't think you're gonna make it. How's your review? I was actually talking to Holly about

434
02:13:04,579 --> 02:13:16,439
this. And the PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2 kind of aesthetic makes everything just feel awful.

435
02:13:16,439 --> 02:13:23,340
It just does. This kind of new trend of the last like, what, three, four years or so of kind of

436
02:13:23,340 --> 02:13:32,869
de-making these experiences, everything just feels like a dream. PlayStation 1 graphics is what people

437
02:13:32,869 --> 02:13:44,020
look like in a dream. Like this. That's what a human looks like to me in a dream. I think that's

438
02:13:44,020 --> 02:14:01,060
what makes it that much more unsettling. And I think I would like to see a lot more companies

439
02:14:02,939 --> 02:14:08,779
instead of going with the- looking how awesome the graphics are and how huge the budget is and

440
02:14:08,779 --> 02:14:13,819
look there's all this crazy stuff all these crazy like sun god rays and beams that come through the

441
02:14:13,819 --> 02:14:24,380
window. These experiences are just kind of way more unsettling. It's way more weird and just

442
02:14:24,380 --> 02:14:38,390
kind of off-putting and awful. PS1 brain? You do not have dreams in 1080p. I'm sorry, you just don't.
