1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:16,219
Yeah, Megaton, I know. I know, this is the town. Seven years ago, I would have been,

2
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:22,140
well, what's this town? You blow it up, or you don't blow it up. I know, I can't wait.

3
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:28,449
Hey, Dr. Church, I really appreciate it. Thank you for healing me. Have a good day, and may

4
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:36,509
the Force be with you, as they say in Fallout 3, and maybe may the Force be with you. Take

5
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:42,240
it all, take it all, take all of it. Take literally everything on his fucking desk,

6
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:50,219
take his drinks, take his whiskey, take his fan. Give me that, give me everything, take all, take

7
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:58,060
it all. Activate the terminal and fucking just fuck up his computer too. I seriously can't help

8
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:08,900
myself. Why would I need utensils? What? Oh shit, they sent me to take their fucking silverware and

9
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:18,480
plates and stuff. I gotta get out of here. I'm sorry. Give me the fuck too. I'm such a fucking

10
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,200
kleptomaniac. I have to take everything. I'm sorry. Give me this light. Give me that book.

11
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,599
Open up. I don't even know what's in the fridge. Give me all of it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please

12
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:42,500
don't kill me. How are the noodles? Are the noodles any good? They're pretty good. What?

13
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,269
No, I was trying to eat the noodles. I wasn't trying to steal the noodles. Are you serious?

14
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:56,849
Do I have to pay for them? Can I get a drink around here?

15
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,569
I'd like to report someone.

16
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:08,509
Okay, you've been very helpful. Thank you. Okay, how do I put my gun away? There we go.

17
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:25,199
See, I'm no threat. I'm threatless. You guys just on me, huh? The guy told me to come in here.

18
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:33,949
I don't understand. Wow, that's a lot of stuff. That's a lot of stuff. That's a lot of things I

19
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:44,990
can do. Activate the vat system. Right in the head. Did bullets even come out of the gun?

20
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:57,939
What? Wow. Wow. Wow. Way too many. Way too many. Fuck it. We're going for it. It broke. It broke.

21
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:08,349
They broke it. They shot it out of my hands and it broke. Why are they fighting? Why are they fighting?

22
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:17,710
Who told them to do this? Did I? It's the lady. All right, one guy is just watching this shit.

23
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:32,379
Kick his ass. Come on, Dr. Lee. And your winner by knockout, Dr. Lee. And your prize is to watch

24
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:39,259
this guy fucking die. We gotta be smart about this. We gotta move. We gotta move quickly

25
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:43,759
because they're after us. So let's go. I don't want any dilly-dallying. Hurry up.

26
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,210
Assault. Assault. This guy's assaulting me. What does she have for a weapon right now?

27
00:03:55,490 --> 00:04:13,060
Is it a flashlight? Watch out for the barrel. She just rocked the guy.

28
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:38,379
You sadistic murderer. Your co-workers. Because I shot somebody with a gun.

29
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:47,899
Fear. Somebody just like blew up over here. Oh boy. They're like evil farmers. Are you serious,

30
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:56,639
guys? What the fuck was that? What are you guys doing? Okay, two very important questions from

31
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,120
what just happened right there. Number one, why are you running at a guy in power armor

32
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,759
with a baseball bat? And what teleported through space-time in the sky? A spaceship from outer

33
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:12,000
space landed right in front of him and a big green alien jumped out and started eating people.

34
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:18,399
And what did our hero do, you wonder? He came up with the most cleverest of clever plans.

35
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:24,980
Sticky look. If we're gonna go through this journey together, you're gonna need to shut up. What?

36
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:39,470
Once upon a time, there was this dog. His name was Holy Toledo and he was really powerful.

37
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:44,910
And one day, these giant super mutants attacked him and tried carrying him off.

38
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:54,740
And what did our hero do, you wonder? He... That was a great story. That's the town right there.

39
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:01,439
I just gotta hit the remote detonator, blow the town up, and I get my cut from you two clowns?

40
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,279
Okay. Well, I guess I probably should have told you this before. That I'm a fucking double agent!

41
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:32,350
Okay. You are just looking all over for me. No need to hide. It'll all be over soon.

42
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:36,290
I'm not gonna come out of stealth. I'm not an idiot. When you turn up,

43
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,339
you're dead. I didn't know they could even have rocket launchers.

44
00:06:41,459 --> 00:07:01,980
Level up! I don't know. I'm not really lost. I don't really want to report anybody. Yeah,

45
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:08,019
River City is run by a council. Yeah. Oh, there we go. Okay. Yeah, I think there might be ants in

46
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:14,000
my room. Bye. Hey, can you check it out for me? Thank God I found somebody because I seriously

47
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,759
have no idea, like, who I was even supposed to talk to about this. Yeah, so, I mean, I think I

48
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,560
might have left some food out. That might be what happened. We did have a party here last weekend.

49
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,759
I know we're supposed to report on all of our parties, so I'm just letting you know.

50
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,600
And there was, like, maybe eight people here. But I'm sorry, I don't...
