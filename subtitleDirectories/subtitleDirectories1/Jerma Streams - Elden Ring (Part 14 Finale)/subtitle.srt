1
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:17,769
Hey, what's up? How are you a little early? It's okay. I it's a little early. Yeah,

2
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:22,890
it's supposed to start tomorrow at like four. We're a little early. I figured I'd start like

3
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:29,940
at least a couple hours early. Give me a minute. I don't know where my phone is.

4
00:00:30,660 --> 00:01:17,400
Be right back. Send a tweet out real quick. And we can get started. What about have you seen our

5
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:25,609
place I have been very aware of the ongoing various battles going on in our place. Make

6
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:32,760
this really clear. The germamite army is incredibly incredibly strong. I'm observing

7
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:47,959
I'm observing and I'm calculating. I have no commands for you. We're observing. Let's see what

8
00:01:47,959 --> 00:02:02,060
happens. Who gave this lunatic an army? I will be I'm telling you right now that I've got a

9
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:14,169
I've got a strong community. What are the orders? I don't have orders for you.

10
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:26,729
Your orders are to observe, calculate, passionate, empathize, strike when necessary.

11
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:42,169
There's those are your orders. Give us something. I am observing. I have nowhere to strike. And

12
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:47,210
that's the thing. That's the thing, right? Oh, German. Where are we? Where are we striking?

13
00:02:48,680 --> 00:03:02,069
I don't have I there are no targets for me here. Where are we landing? You need to defend you need

14
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:13,349
to defend the sus face. Well, I'm aware of his existence. I'm aware. I'm very aware. Worst

15
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:20,310
general ever. General, what are your orders? Very aware. And I want you to be compassionate. And I

16
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:25,960
want you to be aware. Sir, they're flanking us. Just be aware of it. I want you to be aware of it.

17
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,520
And just keep your eye on it. What a bad general. But I don't have anything for you yet. Okay.

18
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:37,020
I am actually trying to see where the hell this plays out. I don't want to make an alliance with

19
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:42,780
somebody. And then here's the Okay, here's the thing about the our play stuff. So if I make an

20
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:49,020
alliance with somebody, that person has a battle or a war going on with somebody else that now hates

21
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,500
me that wants to get rid of my shit. And then I come forward and I go off. Let's go after that

22
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,900
fucking person. I break that alliance that I have with that person. That person that has two more

23
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,930
alliances. Then those people are mad at me. And then somebody from the top right corner

24
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:09,289
it starts posting and saying, Hey, germamites, we need you in top right corner to defend the

25
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:14,250
shovel knight. It's like, dude, I broke like five alliances. And I have like two wars going on down

26
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:21,879
here. I don't know. I don't it's hard to get involved. But if we need to, oh, we will if we

27
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:36,620
need to. We will. What is he talking about? Okay. I will show you in just a second. These are just

28
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:42,699
like the delusions of some random guy. No. Okay, listen to me. I didn't even tweet the stream. Just

29
00:04:42,699 --> 00:05:45,860
hold on. Give me a sec. Okay, I'm back. So yeah, let me explain what this is. This is easy for me

30
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:56,629
to do this. I'll just show you. Come back over here. Hi, how are you? Okay, so this is our slash

31
00:05:56,629 --> 00:06:06,759
place. I've been made aware of this. Every single pixel here, every single one is placed by an

32
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:12,540
individual user. So for instance, like, like pirates, right? Like somebody one person had to

33
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:21,240
click that square right there. It is huge. I believe it's every five to 10 minutes. It

34
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:29,899
your cooldown refreshes is a dick on the screen. Okay, whatever. What do you want me to do about?

35
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:35,019
Oh, no. Okay, refresh in five to 10 minutes and show me where the show me where the where's Waldo

36
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:40,470
dick is. Because that's just going to happen for the rest of the time. This is here. So the craziest

37
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,720
part about this is, oh, okay, we've got there's a little of this, this, I think that's supposed

38
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,819
to be me. I think I think that's me. I've been told it's me. I don't know. I'm like, kind of

39
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:57,899
don't want it to be what it is. I don't I have no stake in this. I have no idea how what happened.

40
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:05,399
I didn't tell anybody to do this. But that is, I guess, where you guys have collected yourselves,

41
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:15,300
I guess. But let me tell you, I there are no alliances here. And let if the germamites need

42
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:24,660
to be called in, maybe it depends. I am totally okay with this being right here. I don't I don't

43
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,990
we don't need to go anywhere else when I do do anything else. I'm just observing. Check the

44
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:55,720
chessboard. Where's the chessboard? chessboard? Right side. Jesus Christ. Okay, chessboard.

45
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:14,459
Left. Why did you say right? Everyone just started saying right. Chessboard. Down near this

46
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:27,740
sus face. Left in the middle. Okay, in relation to Star Wars, where is it? Directly above sus.

47
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:41,129
Oh, right here. Oh, okay. Okay. All right. This is cool. I'm okay with that, right? Can we can

48
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:47,210
just like concentrate in this little spot? I don't I don't need more than one cube. Okay.

49
00:08:49,139 --> 00:09:01,240
Let me tell you, very cleanly, don't need much. We need a square this big. If you attack,

50
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:12,570
germamites are ready. And they always will be. And they're some of the strongest, most I said vile,

51
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:18,970
the most vile. They are very strong and they know and they know how to they know how to draw.

52
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:26,409
This community is incredibly artistic. Like you guys could get the amount of art the amount of

53
00:09:26,409 --> 00:09:33,990
creativity that I see here. Trust me when I say I'm all we need is a little we need a little cube

54
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:43,289
and that's it. There are no allegiances. There are no alliances. Everybody is we have a creative

55
00:09:43,289 --> 00:09:47,850
community here. So I what I'm not going to do is I'm not going to what I'm not going to say this

56
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:53,139
because I know what the second I say this it's going to be like, there it goes, right? Let's

57
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:59,639
observe. I'll look back in a little bit and see what it looks like. We're incredibly uncoordinated

58
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:14,700
but strong. Vile artists. No, you're a community of incredibly intelligent doctors, scientists,

59
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:20,779
and he's along and I got to cut them. Like with it. I just saw it over here. Okay, I got to

60
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:25,179
fucking turn this preview off. I distract myself with my own preview. I'm reading what you guys

61
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:28,059
are saying. Then I go there's a guy right there and I look at it. I fucking hate it. I don't want

62
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:37,289
to look at this. I'm going to move the face cam to the other side of the screen. Oh, yeah. Oh,

63
00:10:37,289 --> 00:10:41,129
I know there are other streamers that are doing this. I've been watching some of them and it's

64
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:48,549
been fucking crazy. It's been actually pretty entertaining if I'm honest. Change your talismans.

65
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:54,570
Thank you. Now let's get to the real thing here. Well, I yes, I'm supposed to stream tomorrow,

66
00:10:54,570 --> 00:11:02,419
but I kind of I just I wanted to do it and I said people were saying some stuff to me.

67
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,169
I'm going to take it to I'm going to take it to heart now. They said, German,

68
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:12,070
these last few encounters are ridiculous. They're hard. They're frustrating. They make people angry

69
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:17,179
and you need to do whatever means necessary to try to kill them. So I know that there are a few

70
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:23,320
spells that I don't have that people keep telling me about and I want to go get those spells and

71
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:29,669
just see what they do. Yeah, it's our slash place. It's really looking even if we're not going to

72
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:34,409
participate all that much. I mean, I know a lot of you guys already are. It's just really cool.

73
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:40,419
They do it every what every year every every few years. It's it's really cool. It's been awesome

74
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:47,340
to see just the communities kind of even across the world watching all these different communities,

75
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:54,620
like kind of if a fun way, right, kind of battle for this kind of land and like territory almost.

76
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,820
It's like, all right, like I've seen like people have treaties. All right, I'll get we'll give up

77
00:11:59,379 --> 00:12:04,259
this the quarter of this part of our of our territory here, but we want an alliance.

78
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:13,049
It's like everyone's playing risk. It's a game of risk with like 60 million people.

79
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:24,139
You're a beta male chapstick user. No, I'm older and my lips are dry. Yeah, it's just they're

80
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:31,269
playing everyone's playing like risk or like Crusader Kings or something, right? You're

81
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:39,159
speaking with Elden Ring vocabulary. What is he talking about? It's just our whatever. You know

82
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:45,370
what I'm doing. So I'm at the end of the game. So this is literally the finale, but I'm not going

83
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:50,490
to go through this door. I want to go get the spell because everyone was talking about there's

84
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,899
a spell. There's two of them, three of them. I want the crazy spells and I want to do the crazy

85
00:12:54,899 --> 00:13:02,250
shit. What opportunity am I going to have after this? So I know people go get the comet, comet,

86
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:09,639
comet, comet, comet, right? Where is it? Do I know where it is? Should you get the spell that turns

87
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:21,929
you into a toaster? That would be fucking Monka Lol. Go to the Volcano Manor. Okay, that's stop

88
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:39,210
number one. Volcano Manor. You should do a long rip. Go through the Windham Ruins in Atlas Plateau.

89
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:49,830
Dude, I didn't do like anything in this bottom part of Atlas Plateau. Do I have it? Or is it down

90
00:13:49,830 --> 00:14:03,750
here somewhere? Where's this move? Right here? After Caleb, you just started zooming by the tree,

91
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:14,889
like up here, over here somewhere, maybe here. You're missing a lot of bonfires.

92
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:25,019
Like three in this whole entire zone. There's a dungeon along the wall, like here or here.

93
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:30,600
I don't think I even walked. I don't think I even went over here or the cringe village

94
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:39,830
at mine you highlighted earlier. So like over here, like in this area. So if I go over here,

95
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:49,909
am I gonna be like in the right spot? Is that correct? South of Volcano Manor. So like down

96
00:14:49,909 --> 00:14:58,440
here. Should I go from abandoned coffin this way? I guess I could just look this up, right? Do I

97
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:10,440
really? I could just look it up. Well, we'll start here. I'm just gonna look it up. What's the spell

98
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:30,460
called? Comet Azur. Okay, Comet Azur. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Where to find it?

99
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:43,299
Uh, it's in the Hermit Village in Mount Gelmer. Okay, so where's that? It looks like... Yeah,

100
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:48,789
so it's right... This is actually probably not a bad place to be. It's actually literally right

101
00:15:48,789 --> 00:16:00,519
below that, the tree there. I gotta go like to... How do I get over there? It's like here. So from,

102
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:12,230
probably from this grave here? It's like right here. Not even close. What are you talking? Yes,

103
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:19,860
it is. It's right there. I'm gonna go from... Should I just go from the... Should I walk this

104
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:26,840
way or should I walk down from here? It's the village on the map. Right here. All right,

105
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:35,340
I'm gonna try to find my way over there. Starting from... I have to go this way. I'm just gonna go

106
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:58,490
from here. Need to see dance. Oh, that's all right then. Wait, wrong one. Go from the... This

107
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:08,099
actually... Because this is probably down. Can I get there from here? There's a discord for the

108
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:13,299
r slash place. Yeah, you guys can do whatever you want. I'm not sending you anywhere. All right,

109
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:28,660
I'm ready. But I ain't... I got nowhere for you to go. I've already played Genshin Impact. Um,

110
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:36,039
I played it a little bit when it first came out. Put like six or seven thousand dollars into it.

111
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:49,849
Then I was like, ah, I'm not really into it. And then I uninstalled it and I broke the iPad

112
00:17:49,849 --> 00:17:54,410
over my knee. That's what happened. Fuck, forgot. That was so long ago though. It was like a few

113
00:17:54,410 --> 00:18:09,349
months ago. Okay, can I get there from here? Probably. Or is it too low? Is it high or up

114
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:17,750
or is it lower? Shit, it's right there. It's literally right there. The way you guys are

115
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:30,339
telling me to go. Is there a jump over here? All right, I'm gonna have to go from here and then go

116
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:44,700
left. Yeah, what I'm doing right now is I'm trying... I'm getting the... I'm going to get the best

117
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:53,269
spell in the game apparently. This is apparently the best sorcery in the whole game from what I've

118
00:18:53,269 --> 00:19:05,670
been told. It just melts people. It's ridiculous, apparently. Okay, now is there a way I can go

119
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:14,329
around? What is attacking me? Oh shit, I didn't even do Atlas Plateau. I just like snoozed through

120
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:27,420
this place. I didn't do any of this. All right, be strong, I'll do it. Okay, is this whole area

121
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:46,119
Perfumer's Ruins? I mean, let's see what's here. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm looking...

122
00:19:46,119 --> 00:20:03,829
I'm facing the wrong way. I'm just trying to get a spell here because you stink.

123
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:31,369
Ta-da. So, from here, where do I go? Oh, a chest. Oh, nice! I'm from this cookbook.

124
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:50,920
Holy shit! Is there a place to go down? Cave moss. Cool, okay. There's probably a way to go down.

125
00:20:50,920 --> 00:21:02,759
Maybe that's it. Perfume bottle. Those are like the flasks. I haven't used them the whole game.

126
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:17,670
Anywhere to go down, like a dungeon or something? Or another. What's that? Yep, very nice.

127
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:37,740
Perfumer's Talisman. The perfume bottle thing, I don't... Raises potency of perfume items.

128
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:47,579
I don't know. This is a lot. Me strong, I'll take care of it. Why do your lips look so greasy?

129
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:56,740
Did you eat KFC recently? Oh, man, I love that. I love that extra crispy combo.

130
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:22,500
It's... God, I fucking love KFC more than anything. After you eat KFC, you can smell it on your face

131
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,500
for at least an hour, even if you wipe your mouth and wash your face and stuff.

132
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:37,960
That's disgusting, by the way. It is. Okay, I think I got everything here. Let's keep going.

133
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:46,539
I need to go over this way. I actually don't want to get zits on my chin.

134
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:50,869
All right, we're going to four. How can I get to four? Around here?

135
00:22:51,829 --> 00:23:22,599
No, around here. Shit! How do I get over there? This guy's a bit greasy. I think I have to go

136
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:31,980
from the lava place, yeah. Unless is there a... Can I go through here? Is it like a dungeon or

137
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:56,180
something? There's definitely something here. Here we go. All right, let's go. Yep. Sage's Cave.

138
00:23:56,819 --> 00:24:17,420
I don't have a... You know the move. KFC Manor. There it is. Not like...

139
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:31,450
Yeah, so there's this move. There's a spell. There's a fake wall. So I know that there are

140
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:38,569
a few more spells. And I need your help. This is the backseat stream. This is the stream where

141
00:24:38,569 --> 00:24:43,930
it's a late night stream. And we're trying to get to the end. Trying to get as powerful as we can.

142
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:54,200
I'm ready to be backseated. All right, I can go this way. Wait, what about down here?

143
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:09,779
Every stream so far has been a backseat stream. Yeah. All right, I can't make that. There's two

144
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:27,099
bosses in this dungeon. Really? Pretty cool. There's a very useful chess piece here. Okay.

145
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:37,430
Because... All right. Everyone tells me about this laser beam move. I know it exists. They're

146
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:41,109
saying, dude, just go get the laser beam, please. For the love of God, just go get the laser beam.

147
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:47,940
It's cool. And I'm like, all right. So that's... I want to use the laser beam on Millennium.

148
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:58,470
Understand? And if it is what I think it's going to do, I have an idea. Can I actually not make

149
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:20,329
that? Whatever. I'm scared. There's two chests? Dude. Lost Ashes of War. Rejuvenating Ballaces.

150
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:27,769
It sucks. It's cheese. Um, that's fine. I know that there's at least three spells that I... And

151
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:36,009
plus I want to... I've gone the whole game without using any of the ridiculous, like, dump 80 points

152
00:26:36,009 --> 00:26:40,009
into sorcery and just do the beam at every boss. I haven't done that. And you know I haven't.

153
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:47,690
I haven't done that. So if there's one opportunity I'm going to take

154
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:56,440
to do that move to someone, it's going to be Millennium. I'm gonna hold on to it. And I'm

155
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:19,559
gonna just... I'm gonna keep it in the back pocket. Mr. Wall. Back here. Hello. My God, there's a lot

156
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:30,700
of you in this room. This will be good for these guys because it'll hit them when they're on the

157
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:51,980
ground. God, I can't see. Come on, Starlight Kid. Do it already. Bandit's Curve Sword. I don't even

158
00:27:51,980 --> 00:28:00,980
need to look at it. Oh my God, what the fuck? This feels, um, this feels like Mario Party.

159
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:05,299
Like, I feel like if I, like, we're all gonna take a turn and then it's gonna blow up in our face.

160
00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:32,809
Okay. Black Hood. Candle Tree Wooden Shield. And Butterfly. Is it? What is the Candle Tree

161
00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:47,819
Wooden Shield? Light for its eyes, easy to handle. About to represent a sur- surrepetitious prophecy

162
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:54,740
of cardinal sin. The lit candle tree design was forbidden. Lit candle tree? A burning urtree?

163
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:09,880
How did you just pronounce that? I don't know. I just guessed. Looks like I got it right.

164
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:24,009
Hey, chat. Did you tell Jerm about the thing? I think they did. The R place. Very aware.

165
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:38,329
I have no orders. There are no orders for you. This guy still doesn't have a lantern. Nope.

166
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:56,440
This is lantern, uh, any percent. No lantern, any percent. Star and Sword key.

167
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:10,230
Very cool. You beat Godfrey with no lantern. Yeah. And wood again, my lord.

168
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:26,009
Raptor Talons? What is that? Why are there so many chests everywhere?

169
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:35,900
This is the most chests that I've ever been in a dungeon. Baseline of deck scaling C.

170
00:30:36,859 --> 00:30:41,210
Claw? What is it? Claw comprised of two sharp thin blades

171
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:55,059
built by the assassins of Ravenmount to imitate the death birds. That's really good for PvP.

172
00:30:59,019 --> 00:31:03,720
Golden Great Arrow. Why are there so many chests here? This is getting the shit out of me.

173
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:35,369
Uh, over here? There's so much stuff. Skeletal Mask and Raptor's Black Feathers. Whoa.

174
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:55,539
Where's the mask? Skeletal Mask. Where is it? Skeletal Mask that tightly grips the face,

175
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:02,339
worn by the assassins of Ravenmount. This ritual implement relentlessly digs into the wearer's face,

176
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:06,819
preserving one's human instincts while dressed in imitation of the death birds.

177
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:27,539
That's interesting. What is this? I have so much stuff. A Raptor's Black Feathers focus and vitality

178
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:34,869
really high. Transforming into ritual? We're transforming into a death bird, if only by

179
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:48,380
imitation. Strengthens jump attacks. That's kind of cool. That's really cool. It's bloodborne armor.

180
00:32:48,380 --> 00:33:00,950
It does kind of look like bloodborne armor. You're right. The boss. I'm so unbelievably

181
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:15,980
overleveled for this. Like, come on, I can do it, right? Necromancer Garrus. Necromancer

182
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:29,210
Garrus is gonna fucking die in another one hit. All right, I got him. Doesn't come back, right?

183
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:42,259
Family heads? What the hell is that? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Garrus. I was way more overprepared.

184
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:53,799
It's a staff. Three bludgeoning copper heads attached to it. It's a flail. The heads were

185
00:33:53,799 --> 00:34:03,059
made to resemble those of his wife and two children. Gently rattle the copper heads to

186
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:08,199
summon vengeful spirits that chase down foes. The anguish of a spouse and children.

187
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:15,639
Invites a cursed wrath. Let me see this thing. Oh my god, this thing's fucking morbid.

188
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:35,429
What does it do? Oh, that's kind of cool. Interesting. All right. Well, that's cool.

189
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:48,440
I don't think I want to go to the beginning of the dungeon. That is an act. That's an actual

190
00:34:48,440 --> 00:35:00,980
rat. It's a baby rattle. Well, it's a it's a it's a flail that has some stuff. It's attached to

191
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:09,449
this. This is the baby rattle. Hurry up and fucking stall like it. All right, that was cool. In

192
00:35:09,449 --> 00:35:17,210
the necromancer, I'm sure 70 to 80 levels ago may have been a tad more difficult, but you know,

193
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:30,969
this is what it is. I'm here for the spell. Okay, we're already here. Black knife assassin.

194
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:41,559
It's I can see the footprints. Okay, I would be really scared right now if I couldn't just do this.

195
00:35:54,739 --> 00:36:27,929
Hmm. I don't have any mana left. Oh shit. Fuck. Oh, I just got him. That would have been so awful

196
00:36:27,929 --> 00:36:42,630
back at like level 60 or 80. Concealing veil. Conceals wear while crouching. What? What do you

197
00:36:42,630 --> 00:37:03,639
mean? It's invisible? Am I invisible? How can I tell if I'm invisible? Well, that's really cool.

198
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:15,289
Is it bizarre? Let's put this back on. What's here? Oh, the damage. The damage one.

199
00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:29,179
All right, so that is not what I wanted. I wanted to go over here. This is not the way I wanted to

200
00:37:29,179 --> 00:37:43,050
go. Can I get out of here somewhere else? Can I keep going? You need to go to volcano manor and

201
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:54,869
then around the volcano. You have to go around the entire mountain. All right, well, so if I go here,

202
00:37:55,429 --> 00:38:03,670
I can, can I go like this way? Instructions to find comet Azor in alert channel. Oh shit.

203
00:38:04,469 --> 00:38:34,699
Directions. Around Mount Gelmer through a canyon. Start from the abandoned coffin bonfire and go

204
00:38:34,699 --> 00:38:39,980
uphill to the northeast. This is VR Josh, by the way. He's just got my back on this one. Start from

205
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:50,340
the abandoned coffin. Start from the abandoned coffin bonfire and go uphill to the northeast.

206
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:56,440
Then go north slash northwest through a canyon. Hug the canyon's left wall and it will loop

207
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:01,159
around Mount Gelmer counterclockwise. You'll come to a castle, go left from that castle,

208
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:04,760
pass some lava fields and through some rocks. You'll go past some advanced shacks.

209
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:12,360
Beyond those is a magic boss. Oh my god, this is a lot. I'm going to do this step by step. Okay.

210
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:26,730
Go uphill to the northeast. Northeast. Uphill. VR Josh would beat Jerma in a fight, I think.

211
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:39,980
Probably. Okay, I haven't gone this way. Why, okay, oh wait a minute. Being able to take out,

212
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:44,780
what the fuck is that? Being able to have, to be able to give somebody directions means I can beat

213
00:39:44,780 --> 00:40:01,190
you up? What are you talking about? Ancient dragon lancex? Oh my god, good thing I'm here way early.

214
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:17,110
Late. Just eat all this damage. I'm so powerful. I'm, I'm sorry, uh, lancex, but you're dealing

215
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:23,849
with somebody that is about to fight, that's been fighting the final, all right, you got the hint.

216
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:34,940
You took, you took the hint. Okay, uh, so north, north, yeah, I would leave too. Lancex just landed

217
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:39,880
and was like, oh, what's this new area? Oh no, no, no, no, no, I'm way, I'm way too underleveled for

218
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,239
this. I'm way too underleveled. This game's fucking stupid. How was I supposed to know I wasn't

219
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:54,170
supposed to be here? And he turned around. He's complaining to his chat right now. How the fuck

220
00:40:54,170 --> 00:41:04,230
was I ever supposed to know that? What level are these guys? That's so fucking stupid. Okay, that

221
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:13,659
was cool. Hug the canyon's left wall and then loop around Mount Gelmer. Stop, stop, stop, stop.

222
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:29,610
Okay, this is crazy. I wasn't even over here. Okay, there's the tibia mariner. This is an

223
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:35,449
elaborate April's rules joke to get me to come over here. All right, can I kill the tibia mariner

224
00:41:35,449 --> 00:41:55,960
in three hits? What do you guys think? Where do you go? There you are. Three hits. Here we go.

225
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,769
One. Nope, not gonna happen. You got a lot more. You got a ton of health this time.

226
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:27,909
Oh, he must be resistant to cold. I thought he just knocked him over. I thought that was

227
00:42:27,909 --> 00:42:40,500
way too much of like a wave that the skeleton made. Could be a mariner. Dead. It's gonna be.

228
00:42:40,500 --> 00:43:01,780
Deathroot and tibia's summons. Easy class. Tibia's summons. It's a sorcery. Oh, it's an

229
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:09,780
int and faith. 28 int 20 faith. Summons a group of those lost in death. Three skeletons will appear

230
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:16,070
from some distance from the caster. Are they huge? I don't want the faith. That's cool though.

231
00:43:16,949 --> 00:43:26,920
Okay, wait. I don't want to fuck the instructions. We'll come to a castle. Go left from that castle

232
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:41,909
past some lava fields. Shit. Fuck. I messed it up. Where were we? Not near the castle yet. Okay,

233
00:43:41,909 --> 00:44:04,500
so I just keep going this way? Over here? Oh, this is grace. I think this is it.

234
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:21,559
Yes. Okay, this is definitely it. But how do I get up there? Stay at the bottom.

235
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:40,539
Over here. Following the instructions, monkey. Mirage. At the end of the canyon is the castle.

236
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:57,940
God. Oh my god. Fucking lava bursts. Watch out. I think I have. I have five. I can do another

237
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:22,869
flask upgrade. That hurts. Come on. What's up? Oh, he doesn't know. He doesn't know. What do I

238
00:45:22,869 --> 00:45:32,059
not know? Can you please be nicer? My little brother is watching. I'll say 50% less swears

239
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:49,780
for the next 30 minutes. See the water. So getting it off there. I want to yell it so bad.

240
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:55,900
I want to just put like epic music and just do the intro as hard as I can.

241
00:45:56,619 --> 00:46:32,780
Well, this is a dungeon. Wait, that is. No, there's actually nothing in here. Please do it.

242
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:41,480
That's like, that's just me. That's just, I'm, you want me to do what you want to do a fan,

243
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:56,019
like a fan dub. You want me to do a dub like a fan dub on stream. Poison. I'll think about it.

244
00:46:56,019 --> 00:47:20,820
What if I get it wrong though? I might not get it right. Who cares? Okay, you will get it wrong.

245
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:25,059
I probably will get it right. Actually, cause I've seen the intro of fucking absolute shit.

246
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:31,960
I'm going to get poisoned. Who gives a shit. All right. I got to pay attention because I

247
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:35,719
can't talk about that right now. No illusory walls.

248
00:48:06,409 --> 00:48:17,000
When will you learn it's illusory, illusory, illusory, illusory wall, illusory.

249
00:48:19,579 --> 00:48:23,659
You do it phonetically like bump dash bump, death dash bump.

250
00:48:29,619 --> 00:48:39,139
Illusory, illusory, illusory, illusory. That sucks. That's not, that's, I don't like it.

251
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:47,429
Illusory, illusory, illusory. No, no, no. It's illusory. It's illusory. It sounds way cooler

252
00:48:47,429 --> 00:48:55,719
that way. Illusory wall. Oh, there's an illusory wall. That doesn't sound right. An illusory wall.

253
00:48:56,199 --> 00:49:18,329
An illusory wall. An illusion. Not an illusion. Illusion. Stop reinventing English.

254
00:49:20,329 --> 00:49:25,769
Illusory. I don't even know how it was said. Somebody said it and I just don't remember.

255
00:49:25,769 --> 00:49:28,090
Okay. Well, this is a bunch of re shit right here.

256
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:46,579
Oh, I actually could have just walked in and done that. I'm too flashy for flashy sake.

257
00:49:47,539 --> 00:50:12,070
Uh, I had a mana? What? Fuck up. Fuck up. I, there's no way I don't have mana.

258
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:28,019
Mushroom body, mushroom arms, mushroom legs. Mushroom body. Mushrooms found growing all over

259
00:50:28,019 --> 00:50:34,409
the body. These overgrown mushrooms have colonized the torso. Those enraptured by the scarlet rot,

260
00:50:34,409 --> 00:51:03,860
they are holy vestments that root one to the earth. It just looks like, hold on,

261
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:21,260
put my like weapons away. Just like sit on the ground. Okay. I, I now have a rune arc on me.

262
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:26,250
I like just sit here in the corner and just have like an item on me.

263
00:51:26,969 --> 00:51:56,409
We're taking that off. Oh no. The bull goat armor. Holy shit. That's actually, I'm not at heavy,

264
00:51:56,409 --> 00:52:10,409
right? As long as I say medium, I'm fine. Dragon gauntlets. I could put the bull,

265
00:52:10,409 --> 00:52:13,289
the bull goat stuff on. Almost the whole thing. Can I put the whole thing on?

266
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:24,019
No. Nope. My pants have to be, uh, light. Oh no, I can't wear pants at all. I can wear these

267
00:52:24,019 --> 00:52:35,400
trousers. I actually, I don't hate this. This is actually, I didn't realize what that, I didn't

268
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:43,909
realize that. I didn't realize that they came out like that. Clipping through the hat. Damn it.

269
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:54,780
I can't wear it. That'll drive me fucking crazy. I like this the most, I think. No, the blue one.

270
00:52:54,860 --> 00:53:11,860
This one. Yeah. This is my favorite so far. I want like blue. Yeah. I like that.

271
00:53:12,739 --> 00:53:23,269
That's really cool. That matches really well. The whole thing matches now. Okay. Well, now where?

272
00:53:23,269 --> 00:54:00,059
Now where else to go? Where am I supposed to go from here? Uh, that way? Honest to God, dude.

273
00:54:00,699 --> 00:54:22,969
He can't even cast. There's four people. It doesn't matter how much HP that I have.

274
00:54:22,969 --> 00:54:47,500
There's four people shooting at me. You know what I mean? No, dickhead. I already went this way.

275
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:57,929
We're gonna go that way. Yeah, because this is, this is like the end of the waterfall or something.

276
00:54:57,929 --> 00:55:14,949
Or can I go here? Oh no, I can't go here. Or unloved. Thief to the Badlands. What? Why did

277
00:55:14,949 --> 00:55:35,960
that happen? Oh, thank God. It was one of those right there. That's actually not a bad thing.

278
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:45,690
That was a good thing. I got a refill of my flask. Okay, so be careful because it keeps going.

279
00:55:47,659 --> 00:56:07,699
I got kind of unlucky, didn't I? I got really unlucky. This is safe. Sir Gideon Andy?

280
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:21,849
Oraloo Andy. Thief to the Badlands. The effa brilliant gold mask Andy. The lonesome

281
00:56:21,849 --> 00:56:37,880
dung eater Andy. You guys really know how to ruin things. Oh, okay. All right. Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.

282
00:56:40,489 --> 00:56:53,179
Okay. I have to hit you once. Oh my God. I'm so glad I'm not doing you at the correct level

283
00:56:53,179 --> 00:57:04,489
because this would suck. I almost killed him in one hit. That was pretty cool. All right, cool.

284
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:25,000
Hindered of rot's exultation. Yeah, it's definitely okay. Poisoning or rot in vicinity increases

285
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:33,139
attack power. Raise attack power when poisoning or rot occurs in the vicinity. Raise attack power

286
00:57:33,139 --> 00:57:50,010
when blood loss occurs in the vicinity. Would be good for millennia. Holy shit. How's that person

287
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:54,969
gonna get VIP'd and then don't do it? You know what I mean? Like the thought is there.

288
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:19,880
The lonesome Andy. Sir Gideon Andy. Oh my God. Like that's so, I hate it. Okay, so I was,

289
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:33,639
that was kind of cool. I didn't do any of this shit. Lonesome ass eater. Ew, ew, ew, ew.

290
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:49,130
I'm sorry. I'm overdoing it. Lonesome ass eater. Stop. This thing's stupid.

291
00:58:50,789 --> 00:59:10,409
The lonesome ass. Imagine that was his name. Oh, hey, I can see it. That's the castle that,

292
00:59:10,489 --> 00:59:34,969
uh, that, that, that VRJaws said. This is a fucking long way to get over here. Okay.

293
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:45,590
Wait, what the fuck? What? This, this is not right. I'm all the way across the whole thing now.

294
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:54,489
Is this the, wait, what does it say? When you get to the castle, go left from that castle,

295
00:59:54,489 --> 01:00:01,320
pass some lava fields and through some rocks. You circle around the whole thing.

296
01:00:02,039 --> 01:00:25,530
And Sir Gideon ass eater. The lonesome dung eater. I'm sorry. This is this it? What the

297
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:43,849
fuck is with all these random bosses? Another, okay. Magma worm. Don't even get up. Just stay

298
01:00:43,849 --> 01:01:24,809
here. Do not go into the lava. Frost him. Come on. Frost him. There it is. Yeah. Let's end it

299
01:01:24,809 --> 01:01:34,969
with a flashy move. All right. I'm slowly cleaning up all this shit that I didn't do.

300
01:01:35,289 --> 01:01:44,199
Dragon heart. New draconic power is available. Okay. So you come to a castle, go left.

301
01:01:45,079 --> 01:01:50,119
Sir, that circle, pass some lava fields and through some rocks. You'll go past some abandoned shacks.

302
01:01:50,760 --> 01:02:11,050
So you want to go through the lava like this way. What about Alexander? What? This hurts.

303
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:33,159
You need the boots.

304
01:02:33,159 --> 01:03:15,670
He's still alive. Jar.

305
01:03:42,699 --> 01:03:55,739
Okay. Anything else? No. What did he say? Icy giant's peak. Lame of ruin.

306
01:04:00,409 --> 01:04:21,980
I burnt the urtree though. He still do that. The jar on. Hold on. Torrent's like dead.

307
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:33,480
Is it a helmet? Jar. Jar that fits cleanly over the head when upturned. Made with pride by iron

308
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:39,000
fist Alexander. In a uniquely jar-like gesture of friendship, it boosts the power of throwing pot

309
01:04:39,000 --> 01:05:01,639
items. That's so dumb. You could summon him for the fire giant. Really? That's cool. That's really

310
01:05:01,639 --> 01:05:16,409
cool. All right. So I keep going. And then it says finally abandoned shacks. What is this?

311
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:23,719
I missed when the jar was yelling.

312
01:05:46,969 --> 01:06:13,460
Okay. I don't want to. This route sucks by the way. You gave me directions through three bosses.

313
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:21,639
It's the only way? Why is this place riddled with fucking animals and bosses? I think that hurt a

314
01:06:21,639 --> 01:06:26,440
lot. This is literally the only way. All right. Well, now I have to fight one of these.

315
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:38,710
Oh, that was rude. What I just did. It didn't even hurt him. Why did all these people come from?

316
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:56,340
What the fuck? All right. I have to actually pay attention to this. Oh my God. Why are you?

317
01:06:57,139 --> 01:07:07,900
I want to get me out of here. I'm going to go up the fucking cliff. I know it.

318
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:44,820
I don't know where I am. Where did I go? God damn it. I'm running by it. I don't want to

319
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:49,699
fight that. I was already going too fast. I could have just the thing jumped from like stage left

320
01:07:49,699 --> 01:07:54,820
and I saw like the corner of it. I should have just kept going. I should have. I got way too

321
01:07:54,820 --> 01:08:00,179
overconfident because I killed every boss in like less than 10 seconds. And that bear was not easy.

322
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:25,239
That was horrible. Go around the lava. I'm already here. I don't care about this. Just go

323
01:08:25,239 --> 01:08:45,779
this way. Where is he? Wait, what's in here? What? Roiling magma. Okay. That's kind of cool.

324
01:08:50,140 --> 01:09:18,119
Okay. There he is. Items spraying his ankle. What was that? Don't you fucking dare. Get the

325
01:09:18,119 --> 01:09:22,520
fuck out of here. How did they even get up here? How did they get up here? They can't, you can't

326
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:31,779
jump up here. Do you see how you can't do that? I had to use the horse. I didn't want to do that

327
01:09:31,779 --> 01:09:44,300
dumb fucking move. You can't get up there, right? Oh my god. This is not possible. You can not jump

328
01:09:44,300 --> 01:10:06,970
up here. He's so menacing. Did he shit out a little bear? What was that? Where did that other bear

329
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:55,989
come from? That was so terrible. That was so weird. That was just so sad. It rolled so far.

330
01:10:56,630 --> 01:11:02,949
It rolled from here slowly all the way over there in tiny revolutions. That was so awful.

331
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:10,949
Oh my god. I feel awful. My whole body feels bad. It rolled for a full two minutes.

332
01:11:19,899 --> 01:11:36,630
Okay. So now we're here. That's slow. Pulley crossbow. Wow. Pulley crossbow. Let me see it.

333
01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:50,250
Okay. Cool. Crossbow made with pulleys and power springs. One in the chat if anyone's fired this

334
01:11:50,250 --> 01:12:23,350
weapon. Liars. I think I have enough to roll up. 140. I need 139. I think I got it.

335
01:12:23,350 --> 01:12:32,520
Okay. That's actually kind of nice. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait a minute. Wait. Hold on.

336
01:12:33,159 --> 01:12:44,949
Wait. I have horror. Horror lose. I do. Did I look at this? Why did I not break that?

337
01:12:58,310 --> 01:13:10,520
139 is what I need. Did you beat that boss? Nope. Nope. I'm preparing for that boss.

338
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:21,159
Because she kicked the ever-living shit out of me a day and a half ago. I turned purple.

339
01:13:21,159 --> 01:13:45,500
All right. I was horrible. Why do I really not have enough? I don't know. No. Dude. How could

340
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:52,140
you even consider it? I just saw a huge bunch, like a big crowd of enemies. And I'm like, all

341
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:59,340
right. And then I realized what it was. And I was just for a second, I was like, this sheep.

342
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:09,100
Okay. I thought these were sheep. Get away from the sheep. Sheep. Get out of here.

343
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:24,979
I don't want to accidentally kill the entire fucking family. 139 is what I need. It's bones.

344
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:40,060
130. Okay. I need 139 for God's sakes. Whatever. I don't. We're on the right track.

345
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:43,739
Now, last time I did like a sheep sound, everybody fucking freaked out and like people left the

346
01:14:43,739 --> 01:14:50,380
scream. Well, like, shut the fuck up. It wasn't funny. It was like, I'm leaving. Don't fucking do

347
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:57,210
like a dumb sheep sound. Do you remember that? I don't think you guys remember like the sheep

348
01:14:57,210 --> 01:15:02,489
that I did. And everyone got really mad. It wasn't like funny mad. It was like, don't fucking do that

349
01:15:02,489 --> 01:15:07,319
again, dude. That wasn't funny. That sucked. I distinctly remember that. And I was like,

350
01:15:07,319 --> 01:15:13,060
holy shit. People really didn't like that. And again, I'm not messing around. It wasn't like,

351
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:24,310
oh, dude. What the fuck? It was like a don't fucking do that again. Okay. What the fuck is

352
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:53,399
happening in this game today? Even though he died. He just got cut in half long ways. Like,

353
01:15:53,399 --> 01:15:59,079
he was like, I'm ready. Okay, here we go. Yeah. Like, he's one of those, he's going to go like this.

354
01:16:02,409 --> 01:16:08,100
He's going to go in half. He's not even going to know why they all so fucked up today.

355
01:16:08,899 --> 01:16:12,659
Don't you feel like they're like, the enemies are weird today?

356
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:18,199
Something's weird is going on. What's happening? Why is everyone so fucked up?

357
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:52,739
Go level up. You're living eternally in a 1900 slapstick movie. You know, I miss like the piano

358
01:16:52,739 --> 01:17:02,500
playing. Like the classic piano. Like. With people just getting hit and like hitting each other and

359
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:11,510
stuff and like falling down stairs and stuff. Like that's fucking hilarious. Endurance probably,

360
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:23,270
right? Or 60. Yeah. There's a scene in Leslie Nielsen in one of the naked gun movies where like

361
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:28,069
he's in an apartment, like doing an investigation, looking for like a clue. And he like bumps into

362
01:17:28,069 --> 01:17:32,789
an automatic, he bumps into a piano. Like he falls over and like hits bumps into a piano

363
01:17:32,789 --> 01:17:40,789
and starts playing this like classical, like automatic piano music. And he starts like

364
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:45,750
falling into the walls and breaking shit. And they like ends up burning the whole place down

365
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:53,670
or something. I remember just laughing at the piano. I don't know. Pianos do it to me.

366
01:17:54,390 --> 01:18:02,020
I think we're really missing like the old high school theater old lady that plays the piano.

367
01:18:02,819 --> 01:18:07,979
Do you guys remember that? I don't know what it's like in like high school now or like middle school

368
01:18:07,979 --> 01:18:16,100
now. But there was one old lady that did the entire soundtrack of the entire play. And it was

369
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:23,720
it was a little scuffed. It was always a little bit scuffed. But this lady worked it all night.

370
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:42,170
All night. Every song, every tense moment, all the tense music. I was that I just got a cool weapon.

371
01:19:01,189 --> 01:19:08,500
This boss alley. It's this literally is boss alley. They all decided to hang out here.

372
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:14,710
This probably would have taken like 15 in game hours to go through this place.

373
01:19:14,710 --> 01:19:17,189
Like at level 60 or 70 when you're supposed to be here.

374
01:19:27,449 --> 01:19:47,899
This where they there's casters here. Get out of here. How many people are here?

375
01:20:13,579 --> 01:20:27,829
I can imagine like the old lady playing the piano right now.

376
01:20:27,829 --> 01:20:46,779
I think sometimes you can hear her like say a fucking really really bad swear too.

377
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:53,689
Fuck. She'd be like ah this piece of shit. Like she'd turn her music over and she'd swear.

378
01:20:53,689 --> 01:21:28,140
It was like Jesus. Okay so what did I just get? Oh a memory stone. That's all right.

379
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:46,010
I'm not going over there yet. Most OP spell in the game. This is well all right so

380
01:21:46,810 --> 01:22:20,500
Homet Azur. Can you talk? Okay well can I do anything else? All right I want to see what this

381
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:32,149
does. Play ragtime music. Oh wait I got something over here too. Roiling magma in faith. Okay a lot

382
01:22:32,149 --> 01:22:43,560
of these fire spells are in faith. Kind of interesting. Okay where is it? Fire is a

383
01:22:43,560 --> 01:23:18,149
tremendous comment within Astari Torm. It takes three slots. Shit. Wow. Oh okay I have the- wait

384
01:23:18,149 --> 01:23:48,619
a minute. So theoretically I already have this on. If I do this. Oh my goodness. It's not going to

385
01:23:48,619 --> 01:24:07,779
work versus them. There's a hair in here and I got to get it out. I got it. Oh oh my god this is

386
01:24:07,779 --> 01:24:14,890
one of my hairs. This is long. This is like one of my hairs. That's what the fuck. It was in there.

387
01:24:14,890 --> 01:24:25,989
Like coiled up. That's disgusting. Okay so um you say that's not going to work versus. All right

388
01:24:26,630 --> 01:24:31,750
where is the other spell? Somebody said they were- I see there's a few super spells. I want to get

389
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:42,649
them because this is it. It's not- I'm not- this is it. This is it. Is there another one? Oh talk to

390
01:24:42,649 --> 01:24:52,869
Selen in limb grave. Rocksling is really good. The other one. Talk to Selen about this guy. I have

391
01:24:52,869 --> 01:25:01,109
it already. It's swarm of flies. Selen's quest. Use that when you dodge the big flower in phase two.

392
01:25:01,109 --> 01:25:08,579
Oh man. Can we just do it now? Let's just go do it now. Let's go do it right now. Let's go kill her

393
01:25:08,579 --> 01:25:15,720
right now. What do you guys think? What do you guys think? First try? We go do it first try?

394
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:54,949
We do it right now? You think? Linestone pebble is better. Okay last charges. Uh I'm gonna say

395
01:25:56,149 --> 01:26:05,239
10 and 4. Let's just see. We gotta get to phase two. I'm not using this until phase two. If I

396
01:26:05,239 --> 01:26:13,210
beat this. If I drink that flask and melt her. Probably gonna get a lot of shit for it because

397
01:26:13,210 --> 01:26:21,050
you didn't beat Melania the way that I did which was soul level 80 and uh a short sword.

398
01:26:21,770 --> 01:26:48,710
Well I'm sorry but let's go. Bombo you ready? All right Melania. Begin the process. Come on

399
01:26:48,710 --> 01:27:16,920
Bombo. Old headphones gotta go in otherwise this ain't happening. Stagger! Where's the Stagger?

400
01:27:18,119 --> 01:27:42,069
Oh my god. Do it right away? No fucking chance man. I gotta get her phase two. She stands still

401
01:27:42,069 --> 01:27:51,689
in phase two for like five to ten straight seconds when she lands. And you know what?

402
01:27:51,689 --> 01:28:07,739
We're going rune arc as well. Let's do it. Bombo! Let's do it. Can I get two moons off? No. I don't

403
01:28:07,739 --> 01:28:24,119
think so. Let's fuck who cares. Let's do it. Got it. All right let's go. Come on Bombo. Fire!

404
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:45,319
Hit her in the fire. No!

405
01:28:50,329 --> 01:29:17,859
You tried dodging that attack? I don't think you can. By the time you dodge the first part of it

406
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:26,789
she's still the animation is still happening. You can. It's just hard. This boss is dumb. I can't

407
01:29:26,789 --> 01:29:59,529
wait to burn her face off with this fucking spell. In the fire. Good good good. Stagger up.

408
01:30:00,170 --> 01:30:18,890
All right back up. Back up. Back up. Back up. Run run run run run run run. I'm paranoid that she's

409
01:30:18,890 --> 01:30:29,060
gonna do it again. I'm so paranoid. She's gonna do it again. She's gonna do it again. Right? Like

410
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:49,829
she's gonna do it again right now. My god I can't even see. I don't want to use the laser spell yet.

411
01:30:50,470 --> 01:30:58,340
She never does it twice in a row. I feel like I've seen her do it twice in a row.

412
01:30:58,979 --> 01:31:08,489
Use the moon blade? Bro that's the only move I'm doing this whole entire fight.

413
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:12,039
You know what? Fuck it. Let's just see what happens. I'm just doing it right now. Go!

414
01:31:18,819 --> 01:31:41,130
What? Doesn't work. It's gonna work in phase two because she stands still for like five straight

415
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:48,760
seconds in phase two. I just have to get her to phase two. Just kill me. I don't want to waste

416
01:31:48,760 --> 01:32:10,810
blasts. No reason. Just kill me. She's really weak to bleed. I can get her down. I've gotten her to

417
01:32:10,810 --> 01:32:18,170
phase two plenty of times. It's just doing it. You need to play ragtime piano. It's the only way.

418
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:36,100
You know I've considered it. I considered it. Ragtime piano music royalty free?

419
01:33:06,970 --> 01:33:16,970
Whatever.

420
01:33:32,710 --> 01:33:35,109
Come on Bombo. Let's go.

421
01:34:02,260 --> 01:34:55,079
Please. Bombo aggro. She's full health again. Oh god damn it. There's no fucking way.

422
01:34:55,880 --> 01:35:07,060
Not anymore. Not without Bombo. Bombo. She just. Okay. You live by the summon, you die by the

423
01:35:07,060 --> 01:35:13,140
summon. She generates almost a hundred percent of her health back if she does that to the summon.

424
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:19,539
She just ate him fucking alive. That was stupid. She shouldn't be able to gain health from the

425
01:35:19,539 --> 01:36:10,380
summon if the summon didn't have any blood. This is gonna be so hard without Bombo. I'm so afraid

426
01:36:10,380 --> 01:36:21,029
she's gonna do it. Just do it already. Just do it. I know you're gonna do it. Just do it already.

427
01:36:21,029 --> 01:37:15,350
Do it already. I got the black and white filter. And I'll top it with one of these accents.

428
01:37:15,909 --> 01:37:25,939
That sounds like a good idea. Okay. That sounds fun to me. That's like fucking grainy. All right.

429
01:37:25,939 --> 01:38:06,279
Hold on. The whole thing. What if I beat her? It's gonna be ruined. The clip is gonna be fucking

430
01:38:06,279 --> 01:38:49,640
ruined. Hold on. Hold on. I need to. I wish I had a cigarette. I need like a suit jacket,

431
01:38:49,640 --> 01:39:07,500
too. You know what I mean? This could be a cigarette. This clean lady down here. I'm

432
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:18,489
really not gonna try. A new tactic, I think. Alice. Alice, listen to me. The new tactic is gonna go

433
01:39:18,489 --> 01:39:24,300
like this. I'm thinking we wait till we get to the bottom. Radio filter. Yep. That's true.

434
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:51,479
Actually, good call. Let me make sure I get this right. Okay. So, okay. So, what we're gonna do

435
01:39:51,479 --> 01:40:04,939
here is we're gonna make sure I get this right. Let's go ahead and bring this up a little bit here.

436
01:40:06,779 --> 01:40:10,699
Does that sound better? Does that sound good? How does that sound? Maybe a little bit. That's

437
01:40:10,699 --> 01:40:20,359
a little too much. I think that's a little too much. Yeah, I think so. Now, you see? How's that?

438
01:40:21,479 --> 01:40:26,600
Okay. That sounds pretty good to me. Now, let's go ahead and get this started, I say. You know,

439
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:46,279
I say. I'll tell you, I'm gonna be hollering here. I'm gonna be hollering here. Get down here.

440
01:40:47,319 --> 01:40:54,329
I'm gonna make sure that we take care of this as soon as possible. I'm thinking summoning Mambo

441
01:40:55,210 --> 01:41:04,489
for the first quadrant of this fight. Mambo, why don't you come sailing out here, please?

442
01:41:05,130 --> 01:41:10,439
That sounds good to me. Show of the moon. Show of the moon. What do you say? Show of the moon.

443
01:41:10,439 --> 01:41:21,770
What do you think, Mambo? Sure thing. Absolutely. Oh, rats. Rats, rats, rats. Rats.

444
01:41:22,569 --> 01:41:31,420
That looked a little hairy there. I say, I say, you get your hands off him. That's my friend,

445
01:41:31,420 --> 01:41:34,699
Mambo, and he's a good friend of mine. I say, you get your, you lay your hands off him right now.

446
01:41:35,340 --> 01:41:49,270
Get your hands off him this instant. Oh, great. Now, she's doing that move. Gotta stay very far

447
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:57,989
away from that one. Oh, look at her. She's, she's sapping the ball as hell. I say, I say, I don't

448
01:41:57,989 --> 01:42:01,510
agree with that, and you're gonna make, I'm gonna get real sore with you. I'm saying right now,

449
01:42:01,510 --> 01:42:09,779
I'm gonna get real cross with you. If you keep that up. Hey, you listen, Butcher. You listen here,

450
01:42:09,779 --> 01:42:32,520
Jack. Here we go, Mambo. Now, I don't get that move at all. That move is absolutely unbelievable.

451
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:38,779
It's one of those moves that you can't do anything about, and as ridiculous as that,

452
01:42:38,779 --> 01:42:52,460
get playing soon. They're gonna be like, I can fly eventually, too. No chance. We'll never fly.

453
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:57,130
All these people talking about getting in the air like a bird. That makes absolutely no sense to me.

454
01:42:57,930 --> 01:43:11,460
Not at all. Hold talk if I've ever heard it. Satanist flying around. What are they thinking?

455
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:27,850
All right, Mambo, come on. What happened to the music? I had some good music on here,

456
01:43:27,850 --> 01:43:32,569
and I don't know what happened to it. Not exactly sure. I don't know. I don't know where it went.

457
01:43:33,130 --> 01:43:43,460
Excuse me for one second. Now, that's better.

458
01:43:43,460 --> 01:43:46,579
Okay.

459
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:51,289
Let's get in here, and let's get, let's, let's, let's go ahead, let's stop, stop the bully.

460
01:43:55,380 --> 01:44:04,460
Run away from that. Mambo behind. Come on. No, no. Not that close, Mambo, please.

461
01:44:06,939 --> 01:44:15,539
Fuck, no. Excuse me. Looks like she's gonna, I say looks like she's gonna heal the whole thing now,

462
01:44:15,539 --> 01:44:19,220
because she did that to Mambo.

463
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:40,020
I think this could be long here. I'm very certain this could be it. Hey, it's possible.

464
01:44:41,619 --> 01:44:51,239
And then we have to break that glass immediately and try to get over there as fast as we can.

465
01:44:56,119 --> 01:45:07,189
See, what you don't know is back in the 1930s, we never exhaled it. It stayed in.

466
01:45:08,550 --> 01:45:13,289
Permanently. We absorbed it into our bloodstream as the second we sucked it in.

467
01:45:14,539 --> 01:45:20,779
And as some facts for you. Now, come on now.

468
01:45:51,619 --> 01:46:44,170
Fuck you. Seriously, that's stupid. What? How many fucking moves do you get before you?

469
01:46:44,170 --> 01:46:48,090
I'm sorry about that, folks, but what I meant to say was how many moves do you get to do in a row

470
01:46:48,090 --> 01:46:53,369
before, gosh darn it, you, how many moves do you get to do, gosh darn it, before fucking, wrong

471
01:46:53,369 --> 01:46:58,170
thing. Wrong thing. And now the whole thing's fucked up, folks, so we may as well just do this

472
01:46:58,170 --> 01:47:27,109
and say, fuck you, die. I blew the whole thing. Locked in, she sat down at my desk.

473
01:47:27,670 --> 01:47:33,430
I said, lady, what are you doing in here? He gave me one look, one quick look in my eye.

474
01:47:33,989 --> 01:47:43,960
And I knew, sorry, I knew right then when she came and sat out of my office, what, it was going to

475
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:53,350
be quite an evening. I knew right there that the next few days of my life were situated, they were

476
01:47:53,350 --> 01:48:06,300
stuck. Gosh, I could get through this. The local paper the next day, yeah, so all the other people

477
01:48:06,300 --> 01:48:15,420
that have died at this moment. So I ripped it up, and I'm fucking mad, and this is the only thing

478
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:21,899
keeping me from fucking strangling myself. Like, just strangling. So she walked in.

479
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:38,619
Can I turn it off now, please? It doesn't work. It makes everything sound horrible and it sucks.

480
01:48:39,420 --> 01:48:59,770
I say, here's, okay, here we are. I'm gonna paint this piece of shit. Oh, I lost my hat.

481
01:49:00,729 --> 01:49:09,979
It's the only thing that's keeping my brain in. Oh! It's okay. Everything's fine. Don't worry about

482
01:49:09,979 --> 01:49:16,020
it. Everything seems to be going very smoothly, as smoothly as it could. Just don't want her to do

483
01:49:16,020 --> 01:49:26,920
that to Mambo. How long is he going to keep this up? Probably until he wins. Or he runs out of mana.

484
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:34,539
This is bad. I don't fucking know.

485
01:49:35,579 --> 01:49:39,430
I gotta turn this off. It's fucking with me. It's fucking with me. I gotta turn it off now.

486
01:49:47,750 --> 01:49:53,979
I hate this fucking fight, and I hate this piece of shit behind this door.

487
01:49:54,619 --> 01:50:03,399
Let's bring it back. 1995.

488
01:50:20,569 --> 01:50:25,689
Okay, let's try this again. This time I'm gonna try. I haven't gotten her to phase two.

489
01:50:26,250 --> 01:50:30,329
I can't, why can I not get this piece of fucking shit to phase?

490
01:50:33,619 --> 01:50:37,939
Fuck this fight. I hope I get to cheese the fuck out of this. I hope I kill it instantly.

491
01:50:37,939 --> 01:50:58,659
I hope I kill her instantly in phase two. I hope so. Get in there. Come on. Just go.

492
01:50:58,659 --> 01:51:02,500
Bully, bully, bully, bully, bully, bully. It's the only fucking way to fight this.

493
01:51:14,170 --> 01:51:19,829
Bully! Where's the bully? Get it. Come on. Go, go, go, go, go, go, back up, back up, back up.

494
01:51:19,829 --> 01:51:43,449
God damn it. Everything that we just did. What a pain in the fucking ass. Keep it up. Go,

495
01:51:43,449 --> 01:51:55,800
go, go, go, go, go, more, more, more, more, more, more, more. She's gonna go up. She's gonna go up.

496
01:51:55,800 --> 01:52:08,500
I just know she's gonna go up like right now. She's going up. She's going up. She's going up.

497
01:52:14,359 --> 01:52:16,520
When is she gonna, she's gonna go up like right now.

498
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:44,010
Is she going up? I'm so fucking paranoid. She's gonna do it, right? What is going on?

499
01:52:44,569 --> 01:53:05,720
Okay, she's almost there now. Oh, fuck. This is it. This is it. All right. Fuck this fight.

500
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:28,100
Let's go. Drink? Not yet. Not yet. Not yet. I didn't drink it. What? What happened?

501
01:53:28,899 --> 01:54:18,789
Why didn't I drink it? I don't care. Fuck it. We're doing it anyway. What did I drink? Talking

502
01:54:18,789 --> 01:55:00,539
about, dude? What are you talking? God, this is un-fucking-bearable. This is the worst fight

503
01:55:00,539 --> 01:55:19,699
they've ever made without a question. Without a solitary question. I think you can just run.

504
01:55:20,579 --> 01:55:24,680
That's the one you gotta, all right. No, no, no. Okay, there's two? Two of the thrusts.

505
01:55:25,319 --> 01:55:33,800
Jesus Christ. At least that's the longest I've been able to see what the fuck this piece of shit

506
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:48,920
even does. Like you're so slow, but your moves are so fucking awful. This is what happens when

507
01:55:48,920 --> 01:56:01,779
you don't have 99 arcane. Okay, testing. If I sprint away, I can sprint away and it won't get me.

508
01:56:01,779 --> 01:56:06,739
Oh my God. Okay. I can run away from that move. That's confirmed. That's confirmed. I can run.

509
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:30,810
I mean, at this point, I'm just. That's one, two, three. You can't dodge it. This fight sucks. See

510
01:56:30,810 --> 01:56:35,050
you in two weeks when they fucking come out with patch 1.04 and they're like, well, you know, we

511
01:56:35,449 --> 01:56:48,149
always, we nerfed it a little. They got a patch 1.04. The first tagline is going to be in bold.

512
01:56:49,819 --> 01:56:52,699
Linear damage output and healing has been reduced by 25%.

513
01:56:53,739 --> 01:57:08,600
I'm not going to waste man on the moons. I don't think they're worth it. Maybe one moon. Let's go.

514
01:57:16,149 --> 01:57:19,430
I didn't, why did I not drink the flask? I literally pressed fucking swear.

515
01:57:31,829 --> 01:57:39,460
That's a broken fucking move. Even if you dodge it, like even if you dodge that shit perfectly,

516
01:57:40,260 --> 01:57:48,569
it doing. I have fucking 52 vigor, 53 vigor. It does my entire health bar. You have to roll in.

517
01:57:49,880 --> 01:57:55,000
It's like she keeps going. This is stupid. This is fucking stupid. This is stupid.

518
01:57:55,880 --> 01:58:03,319
This is stupid. Stupid. It's stupid. It's stupid. This is stupid. This is stupid.

519
01:58:03,880 --> 01:58:08,329
It's stupid. This is stupid. I just want to make sure you understood.

520
01:58:09,050 --> 01:58:40,470
I can hate that move too. That's awful. It's the heal shit. Just don't let the character here.

521
01:58:40,470 --> 01:58:45,590
Why is the only character ever that heals? You've made fucking 200 bosses from software.

522
01:58:45,590 --> 01:59:23,130
You have to have it with the heal. I got back up, back up. She's going to do it. Is she going up?

523
01:59:23,130 --> 01:59:50,439
Yep. Nope. She's going up now, right? She's going up. Yes, she is. Come on.

524
01:59:50,840 --> 02:00:37,270
Mababababababambo. Don't fuck it up this time. What? You motherfucker. You motherfucker.

525
02:00:39,350 --> 02:01:20,140
I'm so mad. Jesus Christ, please. Drink that flesh right now. Drink it. Shoot it.

526
02:01:20,779 --> 02:01:40,890
It doesn't fucking do anything. It doesn't fucking do anything. Fucking Jesus. I thought

527
02:01:40,890 --> 02:01:52,760
didn't know it was going to go that far. God, worst fucking fight they've ever fucking made

528
02:01:52,760 --> 02:02:25,670
in the history of all of their fucking games. I don't want the gargoyles, black blades. I'm

529
02:02:25,670 --> 02:02:33,479
talking about this fucking thing. I'm going back. You want to be a broken boss? I'm going to use

530
02:02:33,479 --> 02:02:48,140
the broken katana. How does that sound? Let's just go to the... Now you're fucked because now I'm

531
02:02:48,140 --> 02:03:04,760
angry. Now I'm angry. I'm like... Hugh, put every ounce of your strength into this fucking thing.

532
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:11,270
Every ounce. I'm going to... Seriously, code it in everything you could... What the fuck do you have

533
02:03:11,270 --> 02:03:16,550
back there? Poison, rot, blood, magic stuff. Just dump the whole thing on it. Dump everything on it.

534
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:45,100
I'll pay you extra. I don't have any runes. This sucks, man. Give me the other rune because

535
02:03:45,100 --> 02:03:48,619
this rune's stupid. Everything's stupid in this game, apparently. You don't understand

536
02:03:48,619 --> 02:04:01,880
everything's stupid. Seven and seven. I'll pay extra. I will pay extra. I'll pay an extra

537
02:04:01,880 --> 02:04:09,140
10,000 runes. I don't care what you put in that. I want it to be able to kill her. I don't care

538
02:04:10,100 --> 02:04:17,130
what it is. All right, we're putting Godric's rune on. I just better work or I'm going to be

539
02:04:17,130 --> 02:04:23,220
even more mad. I'm going to... I'm going to break. I think I have to... I'm going to... What am I...

540
02:04:24,180 --> 02:04:34,489
I'm so mad. I'm trying to hold it so hard. You know what I mean? I feel like I'm like...

541
02:04:37,510 --> 02:04:41,590
I feel like you're holding in a fucking fart and it hurts your stomach, but you're

542
02:04:41,590 --> 02:04:45,029
surrounded by people and you're like, I'm not going to just fart and ruin everybody's day.

543
02:04:45,029 --> 02:04:48,229
You know what I mean? I'm holding it in right now.

544
02:04:49,819 --> 02:04:54,539
It's like if you're in a room with like 10 people and like, oh my God, I got a big gas problem,

545
02:04:54,539 --> 02:05:00,539
right? Like I'm not just going to fucking rip ass at like something. No, I'm holding it. I'm

546
02:05:00,539 --> 02:05:15,420
holding it and I'm fucking going to go in the bathroom. It's 1800 and then probably 2000.

547
02:05:16,619 --> 02:05:31,460
I can't cool down. So angry. I need to cool down. I need to cool down. I got to cool it.

548
02:05:31,460 --> 02:05:38,140
Let's take a rune arc. Pretty cool. All right. Very cool.

549
02:05:39,739 --> 02:05:53,430
Use the mimic tier. No, the mimic tier is the last resort. Moonvale is the beta 0.8 last resort.

550
02:05:53,430 --> 02:06:01,560
I need to sell some shit. I wish I could just fucking relax. There's like a demon right now

551
02:06:01,560 --> 02:06:06,760
that's like, just start screaming. That's what we want to do. Just scream. And I'm like, no,

552
02:06:06,760 --> 02:06:16,729
stop, man. Relax. And he's like, no, we're going to scream in a minute. What can I get rid of?

553
02:06:19,260 --> 02:06:31,770
Okay. Just, just go to the bog spot. Stupid fucking boss. You know, and the music is so good,

554
02:06:31,770 --> 02:06:36,069
but it's making me hate that song. You know what I'm saying? Like when I hear that, like,

555
02:06:40,069 --> 02:06:43,750
I'm just like, fucking hate this. I hate this area. You're reminding me how much I hate this.

556
02:06:55,909 --> 02:07:03,399
I got the 2000 rooms. I need to shoot it at somebody. I thought I killed him.

557
02:07:04,039 --> 02:07:15,220
And this thing has bleed too. Fucking baby rattle. I gotta remember how to play with this.

558
02:07:16,100 --> 02:07:29,859
I feel like this is going to be even better. I feel like this is not going to even be better.

559
02:07:31,939 --> 02:07:38,170
Just kill the bird. Yeah, you're right. But I gotta remember how to play with this stuff.

560
02:07:38,170 --> 02:08:03,340
L1 is the sideways and R1 is the overhead. It'll be significantly better. Use the FP talisman.

561
02:08:03,340 --> 02:08:09,020
Stop telling me what to do. Stop. Fine. I gotta stop like putting the fourth of the

562
02:08:09,979 --> 02:08:15,739
thing where like, oh, you're the, you are the most unhinged Elden ring streamer. I have to keep that

563
02:08:15,739 --> 02:08:19,100
in mind. I have to make sure I'm like somewhere like in the middle, right? Like I can't be number

564
02:08:19,100 --> 02:08:23,340
one. I can't be like the guy that everybody points to like, oh yeah, go to history. He's a fucking

565
02:08:23,340 --> 02:08:35,399
psycho. No, I'm fine. And I'm not going to say anything else. That's nine. Bingo. Plus 10 moon

566
02:08:35,399 --> 02:09:04,760
veil. I'm ready. I am so pissed. All right. All right. All right. I'm ready to at least give this

567
02:09:04,760 --> 02:09:28,229
a try. This has bleed as well. Do you know about the Wraith Bell cheese? I don't. So what, so you

568
02:09:28,229 --> 02:09:36,470
saying I should just get up there and just start whacking. Just like, wham, wham, wham, wham. Is

569
02:09:36,470 --> 02:09:49,960
that, is that the idea? Let's see how this works. I feel like I'm gripping the sword way harder.

570
02:09:58,789 --> 02:11:42,340
Fucking hell. What a great mechanic. I'm somewhere. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. Dude,

571
02:11:42,340 --> 02:11:47,750
it's the camera. Okay. Like I know I'm supposed to like dodge thrower, but like the camera just

572
02:11:48,390 --> 02:12:09,460
fucking fucking rips around. Walk the first flurry. You should have a do well to shield.

573
02:12:09,460 --> 02:12:16,680
Mine's going to come here with two fucking shields. I just hope I win. Let me just see if I can.

574
02:12:17,640 --> 02:12:27,939
There's no fucking way I'm going to be able to do a toe to toe. Not a chance of hell.

575
02:12:59,720 --> 02:13:10,420
Dude, you don't stop, but you don't stop fucking attacking. She does not stop attacking. Is this

576
02:13:10,420 --> 02:13:21,909
intended? This, is this intended? I feel like there's just like a bunch of zeros and ones in

577
02:13:21,909 --> 02:13:25,189
the code of millennia. Like somebody just fucking put them there and like forgot to get rid of them.

578
02:13:27,109 --> 02:13:30,220
I feel like there's just a bunch of zeros and ones that they just like to put there. Somebody

579
02:13:30,220 --> 02:13:35,289
copying and pasting a thousand of them and they like forgot to get rid of them. Like, oh shit.

580
02:13:36,250 --> 02:13:40,890
There's like all this. We got to delete that. Like this shouldn't be there. That's fucked up.

581
02:13:40,890 --> 02:13:51,989
Why is it there? I don't think this is better. I don't think this is helping me out at all.

582
02:13:52,550 --> 02:14:09,000
That's not doing it that much. Dude, I do that much damage with this more than that. Way more.

583
02:14:09,720 --> 02:14:17,020
And it takes the same amount of time. Yeah. Like that's, this is, this is why would I, I'm not,

584
02:14:17,020 --> 02:14:30,100
it's awful. Look, I look at this. That's 2000 damage if I get the frost. I don't think this

585
02:14:30,100 --> 02:14:49,319
thing's worth using. I'm just kind of taking mana that I need. I'm dead. Use rivers of blood.

586
02:14:50,119 --> 02:14:56,539
Bombo's not helping. Use the staff spin. You got to use it close range to hit with a sword.

587
02:14:57,340 --> 02:15:05,270
You have to dodge her moves. I have a hundred hours in this game. I've beaten every single boss

588
02:15:05,270 --> 02:15:15,289
except for this one and the next one. What are you talking about? I didn't run here from the first

589
02:15:15,289 --> 02:15:54,579
bonfire. Damn it. It's just so hard. It's just like, she's got so many different time moves.

590
02:15:55,460 --> 02:16:02,100
It's like, it's like the worst of every part of every boss game. It just really is. She's the

591
02:16:02,100 --> 02:16:08,819
worst of every single encounter in Elden Ring and she heals when she fucking hits you. Are you

592
02:16:08,819 --> 02:16:48,170
shitting me? Why was I crouching? Stop attacking. Just look at her health. Are you fucking kidding

593
02:16:48,170 --> 02:17:00,709
me? I don't think this is supposed to be like this. This is a plus 10 fucking weapon, bro.

594
02:17:04,309 --> 02:17:18,440
Why can you do this? I feel like the people are like, oh, get good. Get good. They pick up

595
02:17:18,440 --> 02:17:23,319
their controller and they're here too. You're here too. You've died 200 times too. Hey, get good,

596
02:17:23,319 --> 02:17:49,979
man. I haven't gotten good either. No, you get good. Why do you not attack her? There's almost

597
02:17:49,979 --> 02:17:57,000
no opportunity to attack this boss. Every other boss in the whole game, even old Radan. Old Radan

598
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:04,170
pre-patch. It was like, I mean, you could at least get away. You can't get away from this motherfucker.

599
02:18:04,170 --> 02:18:13,850
This motherfucker is so awful. You can't get away from this and if you get hit, she just heals back

600
02:18:13,850 --> 02:18:26,040
to full fucking health. This makes old Radan look like a children's coloring book. This boss is in

601
02:18:26,040 --> 02:18:37,100
the wrong game. I get it. I've never lost a battle. I'm undefeated. From software, you don't

602
02:18:37,100 --> 02:18:43,180
have to make that actually real. Just put it in a fucking note somewhere. Put it in a tag.

603
02:18:43,180 --> 02:18:47,260
Have a helmet you pick up. Be like, oh, by the way, Millennia was really good and she lost

604
02:18:47,260 --> 02:19:17,049
not that much. Don't make it real. God, fuck. No, don't drink that potion. She's got full fucking

605
02:19:17,049 --> 02:19:24,420
health again. I can't, man. I'm about to summon fucking five of you and I don't even care.

606
02:19:25,379 --> 02:19:33,500
But do I really need the accolade that I lost like 15% of my hair? I don't give a shit. Who cares?

607
02:19:34,379 --> 02:19:49,799
What though? I don't give a fuck. Oh, Xbox achievement. Like 25% hair loss.

608
02:19:50,280 --> 02:21:39,639
Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. Oh, what the fuck? Last boss in Sekiro, I could like reliably like play against.

609
02:21:39,639 --> 02:21:46,120
I think they just mashed. I think they just put every slider to 100. Just said, fuck it. Let's

610
02:21:46,120 --> 02:21:53,239
just see what happens. From software, they were like, just take every single slider and just put

611
02:21:53,239 --> 02:21:57,879
it to 100 and just see what happens. Just see what happens to the world. Some like world event.

612
02:21:58,840 --> 02:22:01,959
Yeah, just like put it all at 100, max everything out. Who cares? And let's see

613
02:22:01,959 --> 02:22:19,930
what the internet says. And oh, we're talking. They don't even give it when you drink.

614
02:22:28,709 --> 02:22:38,840
Please stop doing that. He's too upset to focus. There is no focusing. Just get lucky or sit here

615
02:22:38,840 --> 02:22:43,879
for 50 hours and fucking just grind this until you burn it into your fucking frontal cortex

616
02:22:43,879 --> 02:22:55,430
to understand. I'm so mad. I played, I played every single boss in this whole game.

617
02:22:56,069 --> 02:23:01,979
And let me tell you something. This is the worst thing they've ever done.

618
02:23:05,979 --> 02:23:11,819
Even that dumb ass dragon in Dark Souls 3 was better than this. That stupid huge dragon with

619
02:23:11,819 --> 02:23:19,420
500 million health was at least like, was like, okay, I just kill me fucking instantly. That

620
02:23:19,420 --> 02:23:26,809
just didn't happen. No, Kos was not even close. Kos had so much, no, there was so much intel

621
02:23:26,809 --> 02:23:34,899
on Kos. Kos was a walk of the park in comparison. There was so much intel on Kos. Kos took forever

622
02:23:34,899 --> 02:23:41,750
to do anything. The reason why Kos was annoying was because he went with every fucking move that

623
02:23:41,750 --> 02:23:48,069
he did. You could dodge Kos pretty easily with the intel. Just running in circles. Bomb up. I

624
02:23:48,069 --> 02:24:39,610
thought you said dodge through the second one. Fuck you. Oh my God. Was that too far away?

625
02:24:40,250 --> 02:24:49,989
I think running is just the honestly like the most reliable way. It's so hard to perfect dodge

626
02:24:50,069 --> 02:25:48,180
like 16 things in a row. Gotta stem it up. Shit. Oh God, she's gonna fucking heal everything now.

627
02:25:49,459 --> 02:26:30,819
Combo just to hit her. Oh shit, come on. I tried to fucking dodge through it, man. It's just so

628
02:26:30,819 --> 02:27:34,809
precise. It's so awful. So awful. It's so awful. It's so awful. I'm so fucking dead. Are you?

629
02:27:54,309 --> 02:29:38,969
No. Oh God, I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. Fuck. This is unbearable, dude.

630
02:29:40,700 --> 02:29:48,520
Why am I eating the poison? Because I don't have any flasks. This is horrendous.

631
02:29:50,500 --> 02:29:54,899
A poison. I don't have any flasks left. That's heals. I had to try to get at least some health.

632
02:29:55,620 --> 02:29:58,579
Guys, do you think I really give a shit of my health bar going like this?

633
02:30:00,940 --> 02:30:10,170
When she can take this much health in one second? Don't make fun of my fucking big

634
02:30:10,170 --> 02:30:17,700
fingernails. They give me strength. Weapons dagger. You guys, okay. It's really easy to sit there and

635
02:30:17,700 --> 02:30:23,219
be like, do do do do do do do do do. Do you understand that? This is the most unbearable

636
02:30:23,219 --> 02:30:57,079
thing they've ever made. Ever. I'm trying. Don't you get it? Just add a fucking stamina, man.

637
02:30:57,079 --> 02:31:03,799
You have to move so many times. You have to move so much more than she does. It's holy shit. I

638
02:31:03,799 --> 02:31:08,760
don't fucking expect people to actually reliably do this fucking stupid ass fight. Holy fuck.

639
02:31:08,760 --> 02:31:20,059
I fucking hate this game. This is a two. This fight brought this game down to a one and a half.

640
02:31:22,870 --> 02:31:25,750
I don't even want this game to come free in the cereal box anymore. You understand?

641
02:31:25,750 --> 02:31:35,459
That's how awful this is. This is a two. Two out of two. Two out of six. I don't even want

642
02:31:35,940 --> 02:31:46,040
free in the cereal box anymore. How much? I'm trying to get her to bleed. I just want to see

643
02:31:46,040 --> 02:31:55,430
what the bleed damage looks like, but it won't fucking proc. I give it a 2.6 GPA. Like, bleed.

644
02:31:55,430 --> 02:31:59,270
Okay. That does a lot, but holy shit, you have to hit her so many times and she's going to get it

645
02:31:59,270 --> 02:32:04,790
all back because nobody's perfect. Not you. Not even you. Stop pretending like you did this perfectly,

646
02:32:04,790 --> 02:32:39,340
by the way. Nope. No way. It's close to the mimic tier. We're getting close to the mimic tier. We are.

647
02:32:41,219 --> 02:32:49,270
What? Like, I'm level 145. What the fuck? How are you supposed to do this?

648
02:32:52,020 --> 02:33:07,799
What the fuck are you talking about? Phase two shit, man. Like, you have to fight her.

649
02:33:07,799 --> 02:33:11,879
You have to fight like three or four health bars worth if she fucking heals off of anything.

650
02:33:12,520 --> 02:33:40,889
Don't get up there in fucking time. Oh my god. I wonder how many people in chat here

651
02:33:40,889 --> 02:33:44,729
summoned a friend to beat this. And they're all sitting here and talking. All this

652
02:33:46,969 --> 02:33:51,370
and they probably summoned three friends to beat this. And this sitting here, Pepe laughing at me,

653
02:33:51,370 --> 02:33:54,969
and you fucking people here definitely summoned two of your friends.

654
02:33:56,389 --> 02:34:00,549
I'm telling you. I'd love to see. I want to see your game files. Show me the game files.

655
02:34:00,549 --> 02:34:03,430
Show me the game files, okay? That you beat this guy to summon.

656
02:34:04,389 --> 02:34:16,649
Show me the files. I want it. I want it. Nvidia shall play of you beating this by yourself for

657
02:34:16,649 --> 02:34:24,090
the first time. I want to see the documentation. I want you to use the power of friendship.

658
02:34:28,459 --> 02:34:31,739
Dude, for the one person in chat here that beat this without fucking summoning people,

659
02:34:33,100 --> 02:34:39,020
right now you are just like, you have huge balls. You know what I mean? That's great.

660
02:34:39,739 --> 02:34:44,620
That's awesome. It must be fucking annoying, right? Like, but like, okay, some of us people here

661
02:34:44,620 --> 02:34:56,090
can't do this shit. You know what I mean? And you could have that forever. You know, oh yeah,

662
02:34:56,090 --> 02:35:01,129
millennia. That's like wicked fucking hard, kid. But I mean, I beat it like on my fourth try.

663
02:35:01,129 --> 02:35:05,530
It's like, okay, dude, cool. That's awesome, man. But like, you must be, you are an alien.

664
02:35:05,530 --> 02:35:11,270
You're a fucking alien from outer space. You're an alien. You were dropped off here in spaceship

665
02:35:11,270 --> 02:35:39,340
and you have like a 10% higher intelligence than everybody else on earth. Use millennia's

666
02:35:39,340 --> 02:35:48,780
shackle. That item doesn't exist. We're going to relax. I mean, I got it a halfway at phase two

667
02:35:48,780 --> 02:35:54,139
before. Let's just do what we were doing before. The reliable thing we were doing.

668
02:35:55,719 --> 02:36:02,540
Getting better. Getting better. Kind of listening to these negative Andes in the chat that are

669
02:36:02,540 --> 02:36:08,569
telling me that I'm, that I can't do it. None of these negative Andes are going to get me,

670
02:36:08,569 --> 02:36:29,079
get me down. All right. Is there a shield that blocks anything? I'm going to put a shield on.

671
02:36:29,799 --> 02:36:34,250
I'm going to put a huge fucking shield on. I'm going to put a giant, what's the biggest shield

672
02:36:34,250 --> 02:36:38,010
in the game? And I'm just going to just put it on and hold it with two hands. It's my favorite

673
02:36:38,010 --> 02:37:03,770
kind of dessert. Tiramisu. Can't hold any of these. These are a hundred physical though.

674
02:37:04,489 --> 02:37:18,950
Okay, here we go. Does it matter if it's on, how do I block? Why can't I fucking block like this?

675
02:37:18,950 --> 02:37:35,030
God damn it. I thought, just fucking killed me already. We just find like a glitch or something.

676
02:37:35,030 --> 02:37:36,870
I'm going to find, I'm going to get stuck in the wall and it's going to fucking kill her.

677
02:37:36,870 --> 02:37:55,899
She's going to go like walk through and die. Let me find some scrap. I'm going to clip into the

678
02:37:55,899 --> 02:38:17,510
fucking wall and she's going to follow me and die. I got to fix this like, just can't wait.

679
02:38:18,870 --> 02:38:23,459
I love what takes you forever to kill me when I'm just standing around.

680
02:38:31,299 --> 02:39:05,399
Use the lie down emote. Try to parry her. Don't drink a potion, you idiot. You idiot. I need to

681
02:39:05,399 --> 02:39:10,940
see, we're going to, this is weird testing. We're just, I want to test and see if I can eat that

682
02:39:10,940 --> 02:39:37,139
whole whirlwind move, whatever it is. Oh, damn it, man. I hate this.

683
02:39:38,659 --> 02:39:45,340
This is the most I've ever struggled on from software was I'm telling you without a doubt,

684
02:39:45,979 --> 02:39:51,659
like not even nothing comes close. And I have 5,000 hours in all the from software games. And let

685
02:39:51,659 --> 02:39:56,459
me tell you something Reddit, right? Like, yeah, I know I've seen it. I've seen, I've heard about it.

686
02:39:57,340 --> 02:40:06,760
I just want to see if I can block this. This is just a wash. This is a test.

687
02:40:07,319 --> 02:40:23,420
Just do it so I can just see if this is worth doing. Go up and please,

688
02:40:51,739 --> 02:40:55,420
please just let me see if I can block the move. Why won't you fucking do it?

689
02:41:01,430 --> 02:41:14,579
Go in the air. Six mana flasks. I didn't, I, dude, we've been trying so many strategies to beat this

690
02:41:14,579 --> 02:41:21,079
stupid ass boss. Am I actually going to be one of these streamers that sits here for like 10

691
02:41:21,079 --> 02:41:28,260
fucking hours to do this? Like, oh, I took me eight hours of two straight streams to beat her.

692
02:41:29,219 --> 02:41:47,379
Go in the fucking air. Okay, you can block the first one. Who cares? It doesn't matter. You're

693
02:41:47,379 --> 02:42:13,700
going to get by the next two. Do the power stands on the Katana. What about Blackknife,

694
02:42:13,700 --> 02:42:20,229
Teesh? Do I have enough, uh, whatever they are? Do I have enough warts for that?

695
02:42:20,790 --> 02:42:38,700
Summon your friend. Is Teesh actually good here? He says so much. Just so much.

696
02:42:39,979 --> 02:42:51,239
Blackknife, Teesh will help a ton. I gotta do something, but it can't be the Mimic tier yet.

697
02:42:51,239 --> 02:42:56,680
The Mimic tier is like, I'm going to like turn on the game show. I don't want to do that yet,

698
02:42:56,680 --> 02:43:44,870
but trust me when I say I'm, I'm willing to. Oh, stop this bullshit. I didn't want to drink that.

699
02:43:44,870 --> 02:44:11,340
I'm okay. Can't see anything. Oh, come on. You're doing it again. I can't hold it. I can't hold it.

700
02:44:11,340 --> 02:44:37,959
I can't hold it. I can't block you when she does that. Oh, I'm trying to parry.

701
02:44:50,149 --> 02:44:55,829
The end of this video is going to be opening up the trash can and dropping the Elden Ring disc

702
02:44:55,829 --> 02:45:31,479
case into the trash. Boom. Plus like for more. Look at this fucking thing. Things are plus seven,

703
02:45:31,479 --> 02:45:52,280
dude. All right. I'm going to try this one more. Where's Teesh? I don't think I do. I don't even

704
02:45:52,280 --> 02:46:20,469
have Teesh. I don't have it. The jail. Oh, it's a jail. All right. Let's go do it. I'm fucking

705
02:46:20,469 --> 02:46:27,670
putting up with this anymore. I don't care. I'm not doing it. I don't care. Whatever. I,

706
02:46:27,670 --> 02:46:34,229
I, I'll, I'll summon Teesh and win. I don't give a shit. Who cares? It's just pixels on the screen.

707
02:46:34,229 --> 02:46:37,430
You know what I mean? It's just like pixels that have been mushed together to look like an image.

708
02:46:37,989 --> 02:47:04,940
Well, I don't care. Where? An area. This one here. Is that it? No. Is that one? No. Is it right here?

709
02:47:05,420 --> 02:47:44,059
This one? Southwest. Right here? Okay. Right here. All right. We need to go to one. Let's go. Oh my

710
02:47:44,059 --> 02:47:48,120
God. He's going to use Teesh. You know, for the last couple of days, I was thinking like, oh fuck,

711
02:47:48,120 --> 02:47:52,040
maybe I'm going to try to beat this. I beat like the last boss in Sekiro and like I streamed it

712
02:47:52,040 --> 02:47:56,659
and I didn't like get like help or anything. And I did it after seeing this for the last,

713
02:47:56,659 --> 02:48:03,420
the last like four hours or so game wise. No, I don't fucking care. If I could summon a giant

714
02:48:03,420 --> 02:48:09,899
omega lull that just came and just bit her head off and just killed her instantly, I would do it

715
02:48:09,899 --> 02:48:12,940
and like everyone would be like, oh my God, he used the giant omega lull. And I'd be like,

716
02:48:12,940 --> 02:48:30,389
I don't care. Yeah, I did. Good. Okay. I don't care. That was supposed to be so angry. Use the

717
02:48:30,389 --> 02:48:53,559
mimic tear. The mimic tear is worse than the omega lull. You'd puke. Mimic tear is not an

718
02:48:53,559 --> 02:48:56,809
instrument. I know I'm just kidding around. All right. Where are you? Let's go.

719
02:49:07,430 --> 02:50:59,899
What's that? Oh, that's slow. Hey, shit. What killed me? What happened? What happened? What

720
02:50:59,899 --> 02:51:08,520
happened? What happened? There's a dot. Oh, fuck it. I thought it was just like magical juice.

721
02:51:08,520 --> 02:51:35,510
I didn't think it was a dot. This is hard too. This thing is in Lunaria. Holy shit, dude.

722
02:51:36,629 --> 02:53:03,989
You can jump over it. Maybe not. That hurts a lot. Whoa. Got caught. Drink. Why the fuck

723
02:53:04,389 --> 02:53:55,719
the input bullshit? 80,000 souls. Holy shit. Okay. You got the omega lull spell. How dare you?

724
02:53:57,100 --> 02:54:23,559
What's wrong with you? Okay. Why don't you use common Azure? Common Azure does not hurt her really

725
02:54:23,559 --> 02:54:31,559
at all. I did it on the phase two transition and it was like, I held it on there for five full

726
02:54:31,559 --> 02:54:51,420
seconds and it was not worth doing. Okay. Where are you? Black knife teach. I can buy those.

727
02:54:52,059 --> 02:55:17,530
You should do rivers of blood while you're here. Are there any more? Yeah. I need ghost glove

728
02:55:17,530 --> 02:55:35,750
ward five. Hey, do I need six, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Let's go. Not the right build for rivers

729
02:55:35,750 --> 02:55:47,059
of blood. You got to respect. It won't work on an in-build. Let's give this another like hour.

730
02:55:47,059 --> 02:55:53,510
We got teach. I've heard this is the omega lull bite millennials head off person. We're going to

731
02:55:53,510 --> 02:56:10,409
do it. Arcane index, but that's like the whole, another character. I have a plus 10 teach. I'm

732
02:56:10,409 --> 02:56:32,950
ready to fuck around. I'm ready to fuck somebody up. 132, man. Holy shit. All right. Bombo actually

733
02:56:32,950 --> 02:56:38,500
was really good. Everybody loves Bombo. How could you not? I'm sorry. I have to put game genie in

734
02:56:38,500 --> 02:57:02,659
mumbo. Okay. Let's see what happens here. Disrespecting best girl with cheese. Andy's

735
02:57:02,659 --> 02:57:21,510
grass shaking my head. I don't care. All right. Get her. Let's just kill her. Holy shit. That was

736
02:57:21,510 --> 02:57:42,360
insane. Oh, what was that heal? Oh my God. Teach. Why are you healing so much more? All right. You're

737
02:57:42,360 --> 02:57:48,020
going to die on you now. I'm just, that should never do that much damage. I don't care how strong

738
02:57:48,020 --> 02:57:55,639
the boss is. That's fucked up, man. Don't you think that's fucked up? You did one slash and it's

739
02:57:55,639 --> 02:58:29,270
just a good 90% of my health. Come on, Gary. Cheese Andy. Oh, correct. I'm back. I'm already a G.

740
02:58:32,659 --> 02:59:11,479
How did you miss that? God, you should never do that much damage. Oh, it's that cheesy Reedy

741
02:59:11,479 --> 02:59:36,840
Brody. I hate this fight. I just want to get, I just want to get out of this fight. You know

742
02:59:36,840 --> 02:59:42,040
what I mean? Like I just, I'm going to go to my game files and just where it says millennia dead

743
02:59:42,760 --> 02:59:50,840
dash space exclamation point quotes, true quotes and bracket. You know what I mean? Like I was

744
02:59:50,840 --> 03:00:31,450
going to put it in there. No, not mumbo. Fuck. Mumbo prove everybody wrong. Juice? What? How am I

745
03:00:31,450 --> 03:01:42,569
out of juice already? She's just farming. Like she's being farmed. Oh shit. I just, I just can't,

746
03:01:42,569 --> 03:02:26,309
man. I'm just so done with this bullshit. I need you to. Oh, fuck off with that from software.

747
03:02:26,309 --> 03:02:42,629
What is with this code? Oh my God. You got to be fucking kidding me, dude. I can't fucking believe

748
03:02:42,629 --> 03:02:49,989
that move. Like you guys put a training dummy on the ground that just like absorbs threat.

749
03:02:54,489 --> 03:03:03,620
All that work gone in one move. Isn't it, isn't it fun? Isn't it, isn't it, isn't it fun for you to

750
03:03:03,620 --> 03:03:13,559
spend all this time fighting this fucking goddamn motherfucker down here is all wiped away. She has

751
03:03:13,559 --> 03:03:25,430
the stupidest move ever across every single video game. Every single one, every single video

752
03:03:25,430 --> 03:03:53,979
game. And I'm even talking about the holy hand grenade from fucking worms. Armageddon. Oh,

753
03:03:53,979 --> 03:04:05,420
you should have gotten staggered. It's so hard. Do you understand how hard it is to dodge that?

754
03:04:05,420 --> 03:04:12,459
Because when you dodge, the camera fucking goes crazy. Sometimes you dodge like the wrong way

755
03:04:12,459 --> 03:04:31,940
because she moves so quickly. I'm not going over there. Fuck that. Oh, I can't. I got no fucking.

756
03:04:37,690 --> 03:04:47,420
I actually can't believe that's in the game. I was out of stamina. I couldn't run. I couldn't run.

757
03:04:47,420 --> 03:05:08,069
I was too busy playing the game right now. Like the from software devs are watching the stream.

758
03:05:08,069 --> 03:05:14,299
They're watching the stream right now and they're going like, oh, here it goes again.

759
03:05:14,299 --> 03:05:18,299
Oh, that move that we turned up to a hundred and fucking a hundred times to just watch, watch,

760
03:05:18,299 --> 03:05:52,170
watch him. Watch him. He's going to lose again. Yeah. Idiot, idiot, idiot. God,

761
03:05:52,170 --> 03:06:10,540
he just never prepared for it. Oh my God. Oh, what the fuck was that? What just happened?

762
03:06:11,340 --> 03:06:14,219
He just like did a full one hundred and three hundred and eighty. He just fucking did a 360

763
03:06:14,219 --> 03:06:37,319
return. Fucking run. Just run away. Look at her health again. The healing is fucking stupid.

764
03:06:37,319 --> 03:06:41,479
What is the, what's the, what's the fucking magical lore reason for her heal?

765
03:06:42,440 --> 03:07:27,379
Oh, let's go read the description. Am I in the rot? Fuck you. I am.

766
03:07:28,420 --> 03:07:39,350
Okay. Let's go. Fuck it. Just do it. Do it. No. Oh my God. Please don't do it.

767
03:07:46,059 --> 03:07:49,579
Get away from me. Please teach me something. Please do something.

768
03:07:53,590 --> 03:08:03,819
I fucking ran out of stamina, man. I have no stamina. I have no stamina. Oh my God.

769
03:08:04,620 --> 03:08:19,959
Oh my fucking God, dude. How the fuck are you supposed to do this at a second phase?

770
03:08:20,920 --> 03:08:25,959
She's got full health. I've got, I've got, I can't, the stamina kicked down. I can't even attack her.

771
03:08:26,600 --> 03:08:29,799
I can't even, she's going to kill me. She's going to sneeze in one direction. I'm going to die.

772
03:08:30,360 --> 03:08:44,979
This sucks. I'm dead. I'm just fucking screwed. Oh, okay. She shouldn't be able to heal in phase

773
03:08:44,979 --> 03:08:57,770
two, right? That's not fair. Relocate flasks. How many health flasks? I don't know, man. This

774
03:08:57,770 --> 03:09:07,959
seems like fucking crazy. Maybe like nine. How about the boys? The boys are going to fill her

775
03:09:07,959 --> 03:09:16,579
health bar five times. What about your armor? I feel like I'm wearing some of the best armor in

776
03:09:16,579 --> 03:09:28,729
the game. You need to cheese harder. How, how? Where's the other, where's the ultimate cheese move?

777
03:09:31,530 --> 03:09:41,379
Just summon people and spam moons. All the people saying get good. I'd like, I want to see your

778
03:09:41,379 --> 03:09:49,129
fucking clocked game time on this fight. And no, I'm sorry. If you came in here at soul level 500,

779
03:09:49,129 --> 03:10:31,829
that's not what I'm talking about. Why does dude twice the fucking like delayed input shit?

780
03:10:32,469 --> 03:10:36,520
I don't want to fucking do that. I want to, I don't want to do, I didn't want to do that move again.

781
03:10:37,479 --> 03:10:55,620
Teach us under ones, please. Oh my God. This is it. This is the one. This is the one. This is the

782
03:10:55,620 --> 03:11:40,940
one he's just got full fucking health boys and girls. Oh, fuck. No way. That's so insane.

783
03:11:41,659 --> 03:11:53,930
That's just like, what the fuck are you supposed to do? If you, okay. I understand. Just run,

784
03:11:53,930 --> 03:12:03,110
but just run, bro. Run. What if you're already there? Like when you, if you're already there,

785
03:12:03,270 --> 03:12:08,500
if she goes in the air like that, it's like, you're fucked. The timings, it's like one, two,

786
03:12:09,139 --> 03:12:20,649
three, four, five, six. It's just like, holy shit in my face. Get the bloodhound step.

787
03:12:21,290 --> 03:12:25,129
Do I have to seriously just go get every overpowered fucking move in the whole game

788
03:12:25,129 --> 03:12:32,379
to beat a boss in the whole? Just give yourself an arm cannon, a mega man legends, fucking eyepiece.

789
03:12:34,260 --> 03:12:39,459
By the way, go get like the, the promoted, like captain Morgan fucking handle of alcohol.

790
03:12:39,459 --> 03:12:52,659
You drink that. Well, you shouldn't have to do all that shit. The fucking moon,

791
03:12:52,659 --> 03:13:06,139
it's right in front of you. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Just, I don't, just kill me. I don't

792
03:13:06,139 --> 03:13:17,260
even care. Tisha's player one. Good. Good. I hope you do. I hope you beat it Tisha. Please beat the

793
03:13:17,260 --> 03:13:20,780
game for me. Just beat it for me. I don't want to suck. Cause if I don't, if I summon somebody,

794
03:13:20,780 --> 03:13:25,260
that's extra embarrassing, right? Quote, end quotes. It's extra, you can't summon somebody,

795
03:13:25,659 --> 03:13:32,700
it's embarrassing. You beat Sekiro last boss first try. Oh, we like to jump.

796
03:13:41,129 --> 03:13:44,729
That's impossible. That's impossible to do that reliably. You can't do that reliably. It's

797
03:13:44,729 --> 03:13:49,799
impossible. I just only did that because I turned into Tigger. That's the only reason why I did that.

798
03:13:50,440 --> 03:14:21,379
Okay. This is stupid, but it's going to work. This is really stupid. This is stupid. Turn around,

799
03:14:21,379 --> 03:15:12,840
Tisha. It's impossible, man. They come up at such weird timings and they go across the whole game.

800
03:15:12,840 --> 03:15:19,399
It's like, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, stab, stab, stab. It's like, you gotta fuck. Are you supposed

801
03:15:19,399 --> 03:15:27,610
to do this? This, the tuning on this fight is like, holy fuck, they broke off the volume. All they

802
03:15:27,610 --> 03:15:39,700
broke, at least this goes to 11. It goes to 11. It goes to 11. Roll to the right. Dude, what do you

803
03:15:39,700 --> 03:15:51,850
think I was doing? Are you shitting me? I was, what the fuck? Just dodge. Oh, I can't even fucking

804
03:15:52,250 --> 03:16:00,569
take it seriously anymore. I got missed the move. Oh, whatever. Oopsie daisy. Oh, the brilliant minds

805
03:16:00,569 --> 03:16:06,969
that brought you fucking Sekiro and dark souls. Comes the ever, the fight of a lifetime.

806
03:16:07,770 --> 03:16:15,030
Melania, some call it, she's never lost. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I have no insults. I'm just angry.

807
03:16:18,260 --> 03:16:22,020
I could have, I was going to just go off, but like, you know what? No, I'm not going to,

808
03:16:22,020 --> 03:16:26,340
I'm not going to go off. I'm not going to be the guy that everybody points to as the streamer that

809
03:16:26,340 --> 03:16:30,819
looks like a fucking weirdo. I'm just going to play and I'm going to dodge this perfectly once.

810
03:16:31,379 --> 03:16:42,629
Now I get that input. Dodge one second later. I can play it on an Xbox 360 sometimes. Like,

811
03:16:42,629 --> 03:17:01,700
the input lag is like a full second sometimes. Don't let her do any moves. Either she goes in

812
03:17:01,700 --> 03:17:59,030
the air killer. Do it quick before she gets this. The game hit her. Didn't that look like her back

813
03:17:59,030 --> 03:18:19,209
was turned? No, I need that person to fight for the rest of the game. What the, what is that?

814
03:18:49,620 --> 03:18:51,459
I thought she was doing the other one.

815
03:18:57,219 --> 03:19:02,260
I thought she was doing a move guys. I thought she was doing another move. I thought that was

816
03:19:02,260 --> 03:19:09,860
the big sweeping one. Oh my God. Fuck this fight. Fuck this game. Return it. I don't have a hundred

817
03:19:09,860 --> 03:19:13,940
hours in it, but I'm returning it. I'm going up to the counter with these eyes like this. The

818
03:19:13,940 --> 03:19:18,260
fucking GameStop that I got this piece of shit from. I'm going to be like, hey, yeah, I would

819
03:19:18,260 --> 03:19:24,120
like to make a, I'd like to make a return please. Oh yeah. You want to make a return? Yeah. It's

820
03:19:24,120 --> 03:19:30,360
been, uh, I know that like your policy is seven days. Uh, it's been 38, but I want a refund. No,

821
03:19:30,360 --> 03:19:34,840
this is the way you suck. And you're gay. Your game sucks. It's like the guys at GameStop had

822
03:19:34,840 --> 03:22:50,100
nothing to do with this game. Come on. No, no. I don't know where you are.

823
03:23:40,549 --> 03:24:38,309
Fuck what happened? Why did she not move? That was weird. No, she had to fucking do that move

824
03:24:38,309 --> 03:24:47,530
right there. Oh my God. She had to do that right there. You see what I mean?

825
03:24:47,530 --> 03:24:51,610
It's like, if you're, if you're within like five to 10 feet of her, you're just fucked.

826
03:24:54,680 --> 03:25:08,520
Oh, why? Oh, why? Why? The scarlet rot killed me, but fuck man. This sucks such a dick.

827
03:25:08,520 --> 03:25:43,420
That sucks. I can't believe she did that fucking move of all the things. It's just like, come the

828
03:25:43,420 --> 03:25:52,260
fuck on. And I was so, I was right next to her too. That's the worst part. Oh, you pain in the ass.

829
03:25:53,299 --> 03:26:08,860
I can't believe that fucking move is in there. Like that move existing just fucking ruins the

830
03:26:08,860 --> 03:26:16,500
fight sometimes. Like it just does. It just ruins the fight. That fucking move existing,

831
03:26:16,500 --> 03:26:21,540
just throws, it fucking just shreds her and throws the whole run into the air.

832
03:26:22,579 --> 03:26:35,399
That's what makes the fight fun. I don't like going to the dentist, do you? The dentist sucks.

833
03:26:35,399 --> 03:26:40,180
The dentist is not fun. You don't go to the dentist chair and go like, yeah, I'm ready.

834
03:26:40,180 --> 03:26:57,270
I can't wait for you to drill in. I'm not going to say it. I was so fucking close. It was one

835
03:26:57,270 --> 03:27:04,149
fucking hit away, but she healed off of the stupid dance thing that she does. She healed like 20% of

836
03:27:04,149 --> 03:27:14,540
her fucking health pool off of the summon. This sucks. I can't wait to be done with this. I'm

837
03:27:14,540 --> 03:27:18,139
going to do it and I can't, I'm fucking, I'm not doing this on Me Strong. Me Strong is just going

838
03:27:18,139 --> 03:27:22,780
to get high and fucking enjoy his life. He's not coming in here. I don't give a shit about secret

839
03:27:22,860 --> 03:27:28,780
fucking ending. Me Strong is going to just suck a fucking ball. He's going to just,

840
03:27:28,780 --> 03:27:33,659
whatever is the term that the fucking kids use. He's coming in here and he's literally

841
03:27:33,659 --> 03:27:38,459
not coming in this door. I don't give a shit how cool this is. No, and it's not even cool.

842
03:27:39,020 --> 03:27:43,180
It's not even that cool. This fight's not cool. Me Strong is going to get wicked high and he's

843
03:27:43,180 --> 03:27:56,010
going to walk around limb graved. That's it. I'm looking forward to that. I'm just looking

844
03:27:56,010 --> 03:27:59,530
forward to like going to limb grave and like fucking just like spelling the ocean and shit.

845
03:27:59,530 --> 03:28:17,780
I don't want to be here. My God, you fucking seriously. God damn it, man. I'm trying not

846
03:28:17,780 --> 03:28:24,180
to lock on that move. It breaks this whole encounter. It's a broken fucking move. It is

847
03:28:24,739 --> 03:28:30,180
broken. It's a, it's broken. It needs to be corrected. They need to get in there and they

848
03:28:30,180 --> 03:28:35,700
need to correct the mistake. It is a mistake. It is a mistake. Why are there so many people here?

849
03:28:36,579 --> 03:28:54,200
I need to relax. It's like people like telling them fucking threads and shit.

850
03:28:55,319 --> 03:28:59,959
Don't tell people to come here. Don't tell people to come here. Why? No, I don't have

851
03:28:59,959 --> 03:29:06,489
access to teach. I fucking hate this. You gotta be fucking kidding me. I'm doing it. I'm doing it

852
03:29:06,489 --> 03:29:20,620
with my original friend. I'm fucking furious right now. What is happening? Do the magic move. Do the

853
03:29:20,620 --> 03:29:52,040
magic move. It's a glowing shit that she has all over. What's going on there? Why would I attack

854
03:29:52,040 --> 03:30:07,860
Mambo? What was the point of that? I ran out of fucking stamina. I'm going to go put 50 endurance

855
03:30:07,860 --> 03:30:13,530
in after this. I'm going to put 50 endurance in it. Then it's 70 intelligence and that's it.

856
03:30:27,290 --> 03:30:28,250
And here comes the fucking

857
03:30:28,250 --> 03:30:52,139
This piece of fucking garbage needed one hit. You had to do that move out of every move.

858
03:30:52,139 --> 03:30:59,500
You were dead in one swing but you are so unbearable that like the the player base

859
03:30:59,500 --> 03:31:08,200
does not even want to fight. They are afraid to engage because a few of the moves are disengageable.

860
03:31:08,200 --> 03:31:15,850
Like that you just disengage the whole fight. Nobody wants to fight you. You're just annoying.

861
03:31:15,850 --> 03:31:21,340
You're an annoying piece of shit. I'm taking one of these right now. I'm taking these fucking

862
03:31:21,340 --> 03:31:33,559
ruined drugs right now. No, I'm not. So watch. Take one now. Quick. The only reason why everybody

863
03:31:33,559 --> 03:31:39,639
fucking does this fight is so they can. It's a vicious cycle. I need to beat this because

864
03:31:39,639 --> 03:31:43,319
everyone's gonna make fun of me if I don't. Everybody, all your like discord groups and

865
03:31:43,319 --> 03:31:47,159
all your friend groups and shit. All you guys are sitting around going like fuck I have to beat her.

866
03:31:47,159 --> 03:31:50,840
Otherwise like I'm gonna be the one person in the fucking friend group that doesn't beat her.

867
03:31:50,840 --> 03:32:09,209
And like everyone's gonna make fun of me. It's a social experiment. Fucking social experiment.

868
03:32:10,500 --> 03:32:15,620
It's a fucking from software. It's a from software like social mind experiment.

869
03:32:16,340 --> 03:32:21,819
There were like government officials just sitting there with clipboards watching me right now.

870
03:32:22,379 --> 03:32:32,149
And they're taking notes about my fucking behavior. They've got like microscopes.

871
03:32:32,870 --> 03:32:36,549
Somebody's watching like this part of my face right here under a microscope.

872
03:32:37,030 --> 03:32:50,760
This goddamn door and fuck this area. Can I change? Can I change? Let me ask you guys a question.

873
03:32:50,760 --> 03:32:56,840
Can I change my ending? Can I burn this fucking tree to the ground? Can I go get an extinguisher

874
03:32:56,840 --> 03:33:01,559
and can I go put out the urtree and can I torch this fucking goddamn tree right now?

875
03:33:01,559 --> 03:33:08,700
Can I burn this tree? Tell me that I if I can I want to. I want to burn this this fucking tree.

876
03:33:08,700 --> 03:33:32,899
I want to burn this place. I'm gonna go back to the urtree. Did my spell even land?

877
03:33:48,069 --> 03:33:53,559
They have to fix this. Can you imagine somebody that doesn't really play from software games

878
03:33:53,559 --> 03:34:03,879
walking in here? From software is going to send millions of people to church.

879
03:34:04,760 --> 03:34:08,760
Like you're gonna you're gonna like make people go like ask god for fucking help here.

880
03:34:09,399 --> 03:34:17,260
I want to see the uptick in like new religion applications after this game came out. I want

881
03:34:17,260 --> 03:34:19,899
to see how many people like went to fucking church. Like went to like their local church

882
03:34:19,899 --> 03:34:57,020
and was like you know what I'm gonna try. Yeah yeah bullshit. I knew you were gonna do that dumb

883
03:34:57,020 --> 03:35:45,510
move. That's the meaning of this. I didn't I I did not press R2 a second time. I did not press R2

884
03:35:45,510 --> 03:35:53,639
a second time. Why did it queue up another fucking R2? Why? I swear to god dude sometimes like if

885
03:35:53,639 --> 03:35:59,079
you press a button in this game and you're in mid animation the fact that it like does that right

886
03:35:59,079 --> 03:36:11,370
after. I want to check checkbox to make that fucking not happen. I want like a dozen checkboxes

887
03:36:11,370 --> 03:36:14,329
for these quality of life things. Just fuck you.

888
03:36:18,520 --> 03:37:04,229
Healing it again. All that fucking free health from that. You don't want. Okay it's it's like

889
03:37:04,229 --> 03:37:08,790
seriously I feel like a speed runner. Like if she does that to the summons just start the whole

890
03:37:08,790 --> 03:37:13,350
thing over. You don't want her to do that move to the summon. She regains like 30 40 percent her

891
03:37:13,350 --> 03:37:42,889
health back. Just kill me. It's like shit. It's like I've had to kill her like fucking three

892
03:37:42,889 --> 03:38:12,680
times already. Fuck you. God damn it man. Look at Tisha's health. It's just throw just throw dice

893
03:38:12,680 --> 03:38:17,639
in the air. That's what this whole fucking fight is. Just throw a hundred fucking dice

894
03:38:17,639 --> 03:39:20,069
into the air. Did you get 10 sixes? Okay good. Congratulations. What? I fucking dodged. Oh fuck.

895
03:39:21,959 --> 03:39:28,600
No. Get away from me. I was so like intensely paying attention to all the fucking moves she

896
03:39:28,600 --> 03:39:58,260
was doing that I fucking wasn't ready for that shit. Oh my god. I don't fucking even know where

897
03:39:58,260 --> 03:40:22,500
the camera is. Oh my god. No I almost I needed one more hit to kill her which means I can do it.

898
03:40:22,500 --> 03:40:33,979
Oh I still got one of the words are like fucking right here and I want to just spew them out.

899
03:40:33,979 --> 03:40:41,899
Oh I want it like I want to say shit. You have no idea. It's taking it's taking like like stone

900
03:40:41,899 --> 03:40:49,500
level concentration. Like I'm a goddamn stone. Not like spew out just this just just talking shit.

901
03:40:49,500 --> 03:41:11,989
You know I'm watching so bad. I gotta I gotta bring myself down. What you're about to hear

902
03:41:11,989 --> 03:41:21,340
is encouragement and praise with cheering applause just for you. Acknowledging you for a variety of

903
03:41:21,340 --> 03:41:28,600
reasons. Because there's a situation that does not apply to you. Just listen.

904
03:41:29,399 --> 03:41:55,239
So sit back. Get ready. Here it comes. We want to thank you for all your hard work. You're the one

905
03:41:55,239 --> 03:42:05,739
who steps up and gets things done around here. You keep your word what you promise and then you

906
03:42:05,739 --> 03:42:27,020
go the extra mile. Job. Job. As Bill Tellum. Job.

907
03:42:29,579 --> 03:43:33,139
You're probably wondering why we have asked you here today. We want to tell you that we have faith

908
03:43:34,180 --> 03:43:44,200
and we know you can do it. We know you've got everything it takes to accomplish whatever your

909
03:43:44,280 --> 03:43:56,280
heart desires. The dream mission you're seeking. I bet it is yours.

910
03:44:00,469 --> 03:44:10,700
Just listen. Everyone agrees. Your side. We're here for you.

911
03:44:24,360 --> 03:44:35,459
Why? She had no health. What the fuck? You've got to be fucking kidding me.

912
03:44:40,200 --> 03:44:45,879
I had to heal. I had scarlet rot. All it took was one fucking, if she had hit me with one move.

913
03:44:47,819 --> 03:44:55,659
Oh my god. This is the worst thing in any video game that's ever come out. Without a doubt it

914
03:44:55,659 --> 03:45:03,659
sucks. This is pure pain. It's just misery. This is miserable. Miyazaki, look what you're doing to

915
03:45:03,659 --> 03:45:10,459
us. Why are you doing this to us Miyazaki? Please let me out. Let me out of here Miyazaki. I don't

916
03:45:10,459 --> 03:45:31,750
want to do it anymore. I don't get it and I don't think I ever fucking will. Is there any rhyme or

917
03:45:31,750 --> 03:45:39,700
reason how to dodge that reliably? I feel like it's fucking impossible. The hitbox is fucking

918
03:45:39,700 --> 03:45:47,540
gigantic. And then she comes at you so fast. Like fuck that move. It's fucking terrible. It's stupid.

919
03:45:48,500 --> 03:45:58,100
I can understand it twice. The third fucking time. Bro, fuck you. And fuck the horse you rode in on.

920
03:45:59,219 --> 03:46:06,629
Fuck you and the horse you rode in on. Did I put the black and white filter back on?

921
03:46:07,590 --> 03:46:14,680
Get her. And this time we're not fucking around. Put it back on. Cheers to you quick.

922
03:46:15,479 --> 03:47:01,290
We believe in you. Dude, I don't get it. I don't understand. It's impossible. What the fuck? You

923
03:47:01,290 --> 03:47:20,649
just dodge. It's not possible, dude. She goes fucking crazy. What the fuck? You have to run?

924
03:47:20,649 --> 03:47:26,809
That's what I'm saying. Okay, how am I supposed to close gaps with having this permanent

925
03:47:26,889 --> 03:47:33,610
terrification of like this piece of shit is just going to go in the air and just Tasmanian devil

926
03:47:33,610 --> 03:47:44,540
across the whole game for fucking a full 10 seconds. What a stupid fucking boss. Did anybody

927
03:47:44,540 --> 03:47:54,459
play test this? What was the game about to release? My fucking hand. That fucking hurt a lot.

928
03:47:55,100 --> 03:48:10,760
Oh, fingers. Okay. My fingers. All right. That hurt a lot. That fucking hurt. They were probably

929
03:48:10,760 --> 03:48:14,840
up against the fucking release. Miyazaki is like, I don't I don't know, man. Just fucking release

930
03:48:14,840 --> 03:48:42,459
it. We'll fix it in a patch. It's like fucking six months later. You know what I mean? Like,

931
03:48:42,459 --> 03:48:50,920
I'm just you're fucked. You are fucked. If you are fighting this boss, right, you're like,

932
03:48:51,079 --> 03:48:57,079
let's go let's go this fucking educationally, right? If I'm supposed to fucking attack the boss,

933
03:48:59,829 --> 03:49:05,030
if I'm attacking the boss, and she just starts Tasmanian deviling homing you across every

934
03:49:05,829 --> 03:49:10,440
you need to run away from her first two, that's dude, but that's what I'm saying.

935
03:49:11,159 --> 03:49:16,920
If you're if you're like, attacking the boss, and this and all of a sudden, like, okay, here we go.

936
03:49:16,920 --> 03:49:25,690
Here she goes. You're it's too late. It's already too late. It's already too late. Unlock the cam.

937
03:49:25,690 --> 03:49:29,209
Last time I did that, I dodged through the first one and I didn't know what the fuck she was.

938
03:49:31,879 --> 03:49:43,659
Holy shit, man. I can't believe she she was dead. I got her down to one centimeter phase two,

939
03:49:43,659 --> 03:49:47,180
three times now. Oh my god, this is the worst fucking thing I've ever played.

940
03:49:49,079 --> 03:49:53,079
Oh my god. And everybody's saying that. Don't you when everybody says the same thing. Don't

941
03:49:53,079 --> 03:49:57,799
we all agree that it's true? When everybody's saying, oh, yeah, this is the fucking shittiest

942
03:49:57,799 --> 03:50:06,680
thing I've ever done in a video game. It's not accurate. 99.9999.9% of people. That's so many

943
03:50:06,680 --> 03:50:14,629
people. I feel like I'm fucking like a radio host. Spider-Man and when we get those photos of

944
03:50:14,629 --> 03:50:19,989
Spider-Man at 99.9999% of people hate Spider-Man. And that's why I think that they should nerf

945
03:50:19,989 --> 03:50:42,139
Spider-Man like I'm turning the J Jonah fucking Jameson. I knew that sucks. Look at the health

946
03:50:42,139 --> 03:50:46,299
teach his health now. It's just like, fuck you. Now teach is going to be dead in phase two and

947
03:50:46,299 --> 03:51:20,659
I'm going to have to fuck around on my own. I ran and I still get hit by the second she went

948
03:51:20,659 --> 03:51:57,399
near I fucking ran away. It's still hit me. I still got fucking hit by it. God fuck you.

949
03:51:57,399 --> 03:52:18,840
Worst goddamn boss. Please don't. Please just fucking get hit one more time. And I'm such a

950
03:52:18,840 --> 03:52:28,469
bad fucking position. You guys wanted me to make my tier list. Put this boss at the very bottom.

951
03:52:29,270 --> 03:52:36,469
Like F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F tier. I mean like F like I want it deleted from the game.

952
03:52:36,469 --> 03:52:43,610
F tier. Like F. Worst, worst ever. And put Horror Lou up at S because that was fun. This sucks.

953
03:52:43,610 --> 03:52:47,530
Horror Lou is a fun fight. Horror Lou is the best, one of the best fights I think I've done in the

954
03:52:47,530 --> 03:55:31,479
whole game so far. F. You got an F. You got an F. Oh my God. It's so fucking slow. Oh my God.

955
03:55:31,479 --> 03:55:35,239
Eat the poison thing. Eat the poison. Eat the poison. Eat the poison. Eat the poison.

956
03:55:36,120 --> 03:56:00,340
What the fuck. What. What. Hit me. It went that far. It went that fucking far. And the rot dude.

957
03:56:09,540 --> 03:56:26,659
Use Comet. Dude Comet sucks dick here. Sucks dick. Quiet. Don't stand in the floor.

958
03:56:27,459 --> 03:56:34,500
We got all these game expert Andys. Game. We got these expert Andys. Okay,

959
03:56:34,500 --> 03:56:44,200
I appreciate all the help everybody. I really do. I appreciate it. I appreciate it. I like everyone's

960
03:56:44,200 --> 03:56:50,219
trying to help. I brought her down to one fucking hit remaining and she does something stupid

961
03:56:50,780 --> 03:56:58,700
that covers the whole fucking game world. I've done it like four times now. And it's just trying

962
03:56:58,700 --> 03:57:05,959
to get even remotely close. It's just so painful. The game just doesn't want you to fight the boss.

963
03:57:07,059 --> 03:57:11,700
The game is telling you to fight these bosses. They don't want you to fight this one.

964
03:57:11,700 --> 03:57:21,829
They want you to run across the fucking game. I don't want it to turn and run. Run. Run. Run.

965
03:57:22,030 --> 03:57:31,270
Okay. Now, oh, here we go. Another run, run, run. Run. Run. Play touch your shit before you put it live.

966
03:57:40,299 --> 03:57:46,329
So our place checking out what happened with our place.

967
03:57:47,049 --> 03:57:55,219
Just run from the bomb attack. Have you played this game? I don't think you've

968
03:57:55,219 --> 03:57:58,260
played. I don't think I don't think that I don't think that person's played the game.

969
03:57:58,260 --> 03:58:14,010
It's so fucking stupid for what for me to lose hair who cares

970
03:58:14,809 --> 03:58:24,719
But German go get the one fucking move ability. You have to get to fight this boss to make it better

971
03:58:25,159 --> 03:58:28,319
You shouldn't have to make do 99 arcane to fight this boss

972
03:58:28,840 --> 03:58:31,680
No other boss in the whole game has been like this is the only one

973
03:58:31,920 --> 03:58:35,139
It's the only boss of the whole game that has been like oh dude

974
03:58:35,139 --> 03:58:40,260
What you gotta do is you got a respected 99 arcane and get the blood move. I don't have to do that with anybody else

975
03:58:40,260 --> 03:59:26,250
Fuck this. I ran a fucking stamina. I couldn't dodge

976
04:01:28,739 --> 04:01:35,819
Did I just beat millennia and show my dick on camera

977
04:01:38,100 --> 04:01:40,100
Please no, I didn't right

978
04:01:41,780 --> 04:01:47,750
No, oh my god, I'm in trouble. I think I'm in trouble. I actually think

979
04:01:48,270 --> 04:01:57,780
This this fly is open and I stood up and I like nothing. Oh my god. That was so many emotions in a row

980
04:01:58,200 --> 04:02:07,340
I'm wearing fucking like pajama pants and these are wide open. I mean, I'm yeah, I'm wearing obviously my god

981
04:02:07,340 --> 04:02:14,329
I thought I was fucked. Why is it open cut? They're just pajamas. It's just pajamas

982
04:02:14,649 --> 04:02:19,360
You remember the dream that I had I thought it happened and whatever I was about to just lean into it

983
04:02:19,360 --> 04:02:21,399
And I whatever I don't know what it would happen to me

984
04:02:21,399 --> 04:02:24,399
I would have gotten like banned and I don't know what I would have leaned into it

985
04:02:24,799 --> 04:02:27,329
It would I would be like talking about like oh my god

986
04:02:27,329 --> 04:02:34,280
We shot German's fucking dick on camera and like whatever. I whatever okay, like I honestly what would I have done?

987
04:02:34,280 --> 04:02:37,840
I would have been like whatever fine. I do cares. So well, yeah, you saw it. I don't care

988
04:02:38,440 --> 04:02:39,920
What I have done?

989
04:02:39,959 --> 04:02:52,579
No, it's the fucking worst thing ever that was actually the worst thing ever

990
04:02:53,180 --> 04:03:07,100
Even with like cheese strats that was seriously like my teeth were falling out. That was the fucking worst

991
04:03:07,899 --> 04:03:10,329
Holy shit, that was so bad

992
04:03:10,809 --> 04:03:24,020
What a shit show. All right, let me I got so lucky at the end there being able to just spam like three moons in a row

993
04:03:27,280 --> 04:03:32,959
We saw a ball

994
04:03:33,440 --> 04:03:39,209
Honestly, what am I gonna say if that ever happened? I did that it'd be like, okay

995
04:03:40,569 --> 04:04:00,959
Well, what do you guys think that one move ruins the fight?

996
04:04:00,959 --> 04:04:06,340
Honestly, it does it does and I know you you'll get it eventually, but I know you could probably dodge it

997
04:04:07,350 --> 04:04:11,389
Okay, if you time if you timed anybody out for like telling me to dodge those and I was like ban that person for a

998
04:04:11,389 --> 04:04:13,270
Day, I'm being everybody

999
04:04:13,270 --> 04:04:15,190
If I if I'd said that

1000
04:04:15,190 --> 04:04:30,260
Do endurance 30? I guess I have of course I have underwear on but it was like, I don't know

1001
04:04:30,819 --> 04:04:42,799
Well, I'm happy that happened, but we're not done. I still have to do the other thing

1002
04:04:43,239 --> 04:04:45,239
I have to do the last boss

1003
04:04:45,239 --> 04:04:51,709
So what what does that does that just what does that do for me? Does that do anything for me?

1004
04:04:52,030 --> 04:04:57,000
Does that open anything up or ruin?

1005
04:04:57,799 --> 04:05:01,079
Take the pot. Okay

1006
04:05:01,079 --> 04:05:06,600
Remembrance of millennia goddess of the worst boss in the game and should be deleted from the game and no one would be mad

1007
04:05:06,600 --> 04:05:08,920
If she was gone hewn into the urn tree

1008
04:05:09,440 --> 04:05:11,840
Power of its namesake can be unlocked by the finger reader

1009
04:05:12,479 --> 04:05:14,479
alternatively views yeah

1010
04:05:14,920 --> 04:05:19,799
Micola and millennia of both the children of a single god as such they are both

1011
04:05:20,319 --> 04:05:28,399
Imperions but suffered afflictions from birth one was cursed with eternal childhood and the other harbored rot within

1012
04:05:28,879 --> 04:05:30,559
eternal childhood

1013
04:05:30,559 --> 04:05:37,670
Check the mod chat for the clip

1014
04:05:41,860 --> 04:05:45,809
If you guys examined it the mods examine it

1015
04:05:46,329 --> 04:06:09,389
Okay, not the mods have examined it. There's no no balls were showing good. So what eternal childhood? That's weird

1016
04:06:09,909 --> 04:06:21,479
Cursed with eternal who cursed very cool

1017
04:06:22,159 --> 04:06:35,040
So now let's go to the roundtable hold check that great run

1018
04:06:42,520 --> 04:06:45,879
Isolated divine tower which stands beyond the lost great bridge

1019
04:06:50,030 --> 04:06:52,750
Stupid-ass boss has a stupid-ass fucking tower. Where is it?

1020
04:06:53,350 --> 04:06:56,610
Beyond the great bridge like up here

1021
04:06:56,930 --> 04:07:12,600
Mm-hmm. You need to teleport you already have it

1022
04:07:13,690 --> 04:07:17,180
Wait, what it's fun divine. Where's

1023
04:07:17,940 --> 04:07:32,530
Isolated my father stands beyond the lost great bridge teleporter at divine bridge grace

1024
04:07:44,010 --> 04:07:53,319
Why not have it anymore because the capitals need to teleport there go to the self limb grave and teleport to the trap with the

1025
04:07:53,319 --> 04:07:54,680
trap chest

1026
04:07:54,680 --> 04:07:58,010
Self limb beer teleport via what?

1027
04:07:58,649 --> 04:08:06,059
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Where's that tower of return? Oh, yeah

1028
04:08:06,620 --> 04:08:10,959
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh

1029
04:08:11,920 --> 04:08:14,069
Yeah. Oh

1030
04:08:14,069 --> 04:08:22,309
Yeah

1031
04:08:22,309 --> 04:08:28,149
All right. Let's tell people I didn't beat it and like everyone be calming me down

1032
04:08:28,829 --> 04:08:49,799
Having a plus

1033
04:08:49,799 --> 04:08:58,040
Having 15 flies having one extra class is not gonna do anything one extra class is not gonna do anything fucking stupid

1034
04:08:58,040 --> 04:09:03,629
I really really like this game up until the last like fucking 10 to 20 fucking minutes

1035
04:09:04,190 --> 04:09:15,489
It's hard and this fucking just broken and stupid and like I take a break. That's not gonna fucking do anything

1036
04:09:20,639 --> 04:09:26,709
We'll get 99 arcane if I that you shouldn't have to fucking do that. I'm just not doing it

1037
04:09:27,860 --> 04:09:34,920
Not gonna summon people. No, I don't I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck. Okay

1038
04:09:34,920 --> 04:09:44,020
I don't give a fuck. Stop telling me to fucking summon. I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck

1039
04:09:44,540 --> 04:09:50,059
Stop telling me to do that. I never get angry on these streams

1040
04:09:50,059 --> 04:09:55,950
I really don't but like I'm fucking seriously, it's so mad right now. I'm never gonna beat it

1041
04:09:56,389 --> 04:10:00,770
And it sucks because the game is actually really fucking fun beside this. It's like an eight now

1042
04:10:00,770 --> 04:10:02,770
I give this like a fucking seven point nine

1043
04:10:02,770 --> 04:10:06,260
Are you telling me to go all the way to the fucking you want me to go get this fucking item?

1044
04:10:06,260 --> 04:10:07,540
That's gonna help

1045
04:10:07,540 --> 04:10:13,090
Didn't be like that

1046
04:10:14,649 --> 04:10:16,290
We got you

1047
04:10:16,290 --> 04:10:25,620
You that just came in you probably really concerned there. We got you. We got you. Yep. We got you. Mm-hmm

1048
04:10:27,840 --> 04:10:33,549
I'm sorry. I hate myself. Okay, uh

1049
04:10:36,000 --> 04:10:52,799
It's down here. L didn't ring L didn't ring L didn't ring L didn't ring. All right

1050
04:10:52,920 --> 04:10:54,399
Let's start the chant

1051
04:10:54,399 --> 04:11:02,200
Elden ring sucks. Elden ring sucks. Elden ring sucks. Elden ring sucks. Elden ring sucks. Elden ring sucks. Elden ring sucks

1052
04:11:08,459 --> 04:11:13,280
Imagine coming into the screen and just seeing the chat just like just spamming Elden ring sucks

1053
04:11:13,860 --> 04:11:19,059
It's like no, it doesn't what why is everybody hated here?

1054
04:11:27,409 --> 04:11:33,780
Sucks like that's what makes me feel better. Just get everybody to say Elden ring sucks

1055
04:11:34,399 --> 04:11:38,040
Yeah, that'll be I that makes me feel so it's like it's midnight. Holy shit

1056
04:11:39,040 --> 04:11:50,229
Extreme you should show us. You should show us crushing watermelons with your thighs

1057
04:11:51,030 --> 04:12:02,610
Do you imagine if I act if I did that like oh today guys, I'm gonna crush watermelons with my thighs

1058
04:12:03,309 --> 04:12:20,340
He's a stupid. What's stopping you? Um a lot of things actually. Oh this thing

1059
04:12:21,120 --> 04:12:26,690
Wow, that's actually kind of cool. So this thing's turned on. I

1060
04:12:30,790 --> 04:12:44,579
What the hell so that's how you get the guy I've looked at this before

1061
04:12:45,219 --> 04:13:04,100
Least on the map isolated to mine tower. This guy doesn't even own a watermelon. I mean, they're not really in season right now

1062
04:13:04,620 --> 04:13:27,159
What was that? What's that? I just like play-doh when you like the play-doh mush things

1063
04:13:27,159 --> 04:13:29,159
Are you push the play-doh through the thing? I?

1064
04:13:36,709 --> 04:13:46,850
Ain't not supposed to do this you fall down. You'll fall backwards, right?

1065
04:13:47,370 --> 04:14:09,450
What would you do if there was another millennia at the top of this tower?

1066
04:14:10,209 --> 04:14:21,200
Um, I would probably turn around and walk away and go fight the last boss

1067
04:14:21,360 --> 04:14:36,299
It's fucked up somebody's who would mean who spoiled it who spoiled it. Oh really? Okay

1068
04:14:36,879 --> 04:15:17,309
Are you guys full of crap? You guys are full of shit. Whoa, you can see a zoo

1069
04:15:17,309 --> 04:15:30,059
I thought that Azula existed in a time like outside of reality or something. Whoa

1070
04:15:30,440 --> 04:15:39,569
So what the hell is going on here? I thought that Azula existed like somewhere way out and not here

1071
04:15:39,989 --> 04:15:48,629
Just the center of the vortex does what happened?

1072
04:15:49,030 --> 04:16:04,450
What happened? Why is that place just destroyed? What I don't understand what happened. I'm in the future

1073
04:16:04,850 --> 04:16:20,469
This thing's in the past. All right. So what is for a boss that was that horrendous?

1074
04:16:20,469 --> 04:16:23,409
What does your rune do attacks recover HP after damage is taken?

1075
04:16:25,270 --> 04:16:31,959
So blood-borne acts made immediately after receiving damage will partially yeah, it's the rally from blood-borne

1076
04:16:32,440 --> 04:16:37,719
That's kind of cool, but I don't really need it. Do I have all the ruins?

1077
04:16:37,719 --> 04:16:44,569
I have I have the entire I have the whole Elden Ring don't I?

1078
04:16:45,090 --> 04:16:53,270
Lenny is daughter to Queen America and Radegon and her great rune should have been the most sacred of all

1079
04:16:53,270 --> 04:17:25,379
I have the whole thing. Okay, where's Mickela's rune? I don't know. Oh the remembrance, right?

1080
04:17:25,860 --> 04:18:00,430
Okay, you need to get the other I don't know and of millennia decks and strength causes blood loss

1081
04:18:00,969 --> 04:18:05,059
Decks 48 laid built into Millennia's prosthetic arm

1082
04:18:05,700 --> 04:18:13,190
Millennia's war prosthesis symbolized her victories some claim to have seen wings when the weapon was raised aloft

1083
04:18:13,790 --> 04:18:18,049
Wings of fierce determination that have been never known to feed until I did it

1084
04:18:19,229 --> 04:18:22,649
Waterfall dance perform a series of one-footed leaps in the manner of a waterfowl

1085
04:18:23,149 --> 04:18:35,819
When Lisa Swift you agree, that's the move. It's the bullshit move. Well, this is I don't have 50 decks

1086
04:18:35,819 --> 04:18:38,420
I'm not gonna get it. This is a faith move

1087
04:18:38,940 --> 04:18:48,840
It's a giant flower that explodes with scarlet rot each time the scarlet flower blooms Millennia's rot advances

1088
04:18:49,479 --> 04:18:53,500
That's bloomed twice already with the third bloom. She will become a true goddess

1089
04:18:53,979 --> 04:18:59,889
We do that

1090
04:18:59,889 --> 04:19:08,209
This whore this whore Lou. Oh, yeah, this is the super. Yeah, I don't we're not gonna do any either of these

1091
04:19:08,729 --> 04:19:15,260
Although this move could be cool

1092
04:19:19,520 --> 04:19:26,209
It's an ash of war which I don't think I can use on either of my weapons get it for you collection

1093
04:19:26,809 --> 04:19:47,340
Melee is usable on all melee assume her soul and buy 500 throwing knives

1094
04:19:47,819 --> 04:19:53,680
What about the equipment you can get the winged helm?

1095
04:19:54,200 --> 04:19:59,850
Winged helm made of unallied gold worn by millennia blade of Michaela

1096
04:20:00,899 --> 04:20:02,899
Millennia awaited Michaela at the foot of the husk

1097
04:20:03,459 --> 04:20:10,090
My brother will keep his promise. He possesses the wisdom the allure of a god. He's the most fearsome Empyrean of all

1098
04:20:10,090 --> 04:20:17,360
I don't want this cuz I hate this boss. I hate this person

1099
04:20:17,760 --> 04:20:26,760
This could give you this could deposit five dollars a second into my bank account and I would still not fucking wear it in principle

1100
04:20:32,450 --> 04:20:38,370
What a dumbass like that's fucking stupid. Oh

1101
04:20:39,250 --> 04:20:46,260
Just put it on and go idle and just go fucking go to the store. Just relax. I just leave it on

1102
04:20:46,879 --> 04:20:48,879
I would even play the game

1103
04:20:49,239 --> 04:20:55,420
five five dollars a second is

1104
04:20:56,620 --> 04:21:08,219
Let me see how much of a dumbass. I really am how many seconds were in a day. There are 60 seconds in a minute

1105
04:21:10,840 --> 04:21:16,329
8,000 660 time 60 times 24

1106
04:21:21,010 --> 04:21:26,430
86,000 it's about 50,000 dollars a day

1107
04:21:26,950 --> 04:21:34,420
50,000

1108
04:21:35,139 --> 04:21:37,139
Day is it a day

1109
04:21:39,299 --> 04:21:41,860
$18,000 an hour and I wouldn't do that

1110
04:21:42,500 --> 04:21:46,340
Holy shit. I did not I must have hated this

1111
04:21:50,440 --> 04:21:54,760
If I got $18,000 a day for putting this armor on and leaving my computer idle

1112
04:21:56,579 --> 04:22:03,979
Fucking dumb. Well now I can't do that. Now the power is taken from me, right?

1113
04:22:03,979 --> 04:22:11,250
I already said I wouldn't so I can't have it cool armor

1114
04:22:11,250 --> 04:22:25,909
Never buying it. Never putting it on. That's cool. So now

1115
04:22:28,620 --> 04:22:36,100
I'm gonna smash them. I'm gonna smash. I'm not gonna use this so I'm gonna smash it

1116
04:22:36,620 --> 04:22:39,379
Plus it means I get to kill her again

1117
04:22:39,799 --> 04:22:51,000
shit, uh

1118
04:22:51,000 --> 04:22:59,719
Maybe I'll get the move for fun. Can I level up? I can't just to level up one more time

1119
04:23:00,959 --> 04:23:13,079
140 I'll get the move try it. I mean why not? It's not like leveling up is gonna do very much anymore. Anyways

1120
04:23:13,719 --> 04:23:26,709
You missed an entire underground area

1121
04:23:27,270 --> 04:23:33,680
How much longer you plan on screaming? Um, I'm gonna try to beat the game tonight

1122
04:23:34,280 --> 04:23:38,239
Or at least get close enough where I have like one more thing to do

1123
04:23:38,760 --> 04:23:49,340
Where's the you actually did I did not do deep root do the underground you missed a boss

1163
04:34:02,849 --> 04:34:11,400
Yeah, I remember watching her do this. I remember watching her at least go through this

1164
04:34:11,840 --> 04:34:24,610
Yeah, you supposed to kill these because like she was slaughtering these things. He was just like what what?

1165
04:34:25,810 --> 04:34:31,009
And I was like, you don't need souls or you don't have to oh, that's what she was doing

1166
04:34:31,529 --> 04:34:38,319
Right now. She's probably just like you motherfucker. I did not do that

1167
04:34:38,680 --> 04:34:44,849

That's the dude that raged. All right

1171
04:35:10,000 --> 04:35:18,919
There's a difference between being very upset at millennia the first night of Mickela. Okay

1172
04:35:21,159 --> 04:35:33,479
No, Jerma, this boss is too hard. Nothing is harder than millennia. No way

1173
04:35:34,040 --> 04:35:50,360
No doubt, I don't think I do not believe a word you're saying I just killed somebody very far away

1174
04:35:59,599 --> 04:36:04,560
You afraid of awkward up? You're no joke

1175
04:36:05,720 --> 04:36:14,400
Nothing is even remotely as hard as millennia. This whole game is gonna feel like a cakewalk for the rest of time

1176
04:36:14,400 --> 04:36:20,840
I play it. I press the button you can have an Xbox controls sucks

Water you need to go say sorry to Holly night. I did didn't I I'm sorry Holly

1219
04:47:55,159 --> 04:47:57,659
Didn't mean to tell everybody that you were like murderer

1220
04:47:59,619 --> 04:48:09,340
Okay

1221
04:48:09,740 --> 04:48:15,659
Talk to the NPC you get a blood-borne reference

1222
04:48:16,540 --> 04:48:24,490
My mic has been pointed the wrong direction since I punched it like three hours ago

1223
04:48:25,009 --> 04:48:34,110
Have I sounded weird for the last like two or three hours?

1224
04:48:34,930 --> 04:48:37,810
eat brute depths

1225
04:48:56,060 --> 04:49:04,979
Okay, that's actually good for people that are that big. Oh

1226
04:49:10,740 --> 04:49:13,659
No, you know, you can start with it. You cannot finish with it

1227
04:49:14,299 --> 04:49:24,470
These guys were so hard the first like 10 to 20 hours of game. They were terrifying

1228
04:49:25,290 --> 04:49:30,340
staff of the avatar

1229
04:49:38,200 --> 04:49:40,200
C-strength D faith. I

1230
04:49:40,279 --> 04:49:43,669
Actually would probably want to use this

1231
04:49:43,669 --> 04:49:54,979
Bird tree slam. Oh that says the golden shockwaves everywhere shit

1232
04:49:55,299 --> 04:50:01,849
Use the most broken sword the game and says the bosses are easy

1233
04:50:02,409 --> 04:50:03,490
Dude

1234
04:50:03,490 --> 04:50:09,700
This weapon has been equipped for like 4% of my playtime

1235
04:50:10,340 --> 04:50:16,380
Okay, this is the weapon that I'm only using this just because I want to get my plus 10 out of it

1236
04:50:16,380 --> 04:50:18,299
This is what I was using before

1237
04:50:18,299 --> 04:50:24,240
You like I understand that like when people see the moon veil

1238
04:50:24,279 --> 04:50:30,520
They just go rabid because everybody in PvP just like spams it and everyone just hates it and it's an overpowered weapon

1239
04:50:30,639 --> 04:50:32,639
No, I I get it

1240
04:50:32,959 --> 04:50:34,959
But you really gonna do that to me?

1241
04:50:37,349 --> 04:50:39,709
This is my weapon, it's the baby rattle

1242
04:50:40,669 --> 04:50:59,540
I've only used that moon veil or like 2% of the game. So can't level up my axe and my bow

1243
04:51:00,220 --> 04:51:14,490
My bow and my bow. Oh, I'm use the horse

1244
04:51:15,130 --> 04:51:23,209
What flavor of axe body spray do you like do it when they did the chocolate one?

1245
04:51:25,470 --> 04:51:49,470
Yeah, they did it. Yeah, they did a chocolate like body wash and body spray and it was kind of

1246
04:51:50,110 --> 04:51:55,119
Weird it was awful smelling. But at the same time you kind of got used to it and you liked it

1247
04:51:55,759 --> 04:52:03,400
Kind of sounds felt like like like burnt sugar or something. You missed it

1248
04:52:03,900 --> 04:52:25,580
But did I miss you missed it? What did I miss? There's a dung beetle. Whatever be strong. I'll get it

1249
04:52:25,919 --> 04:52:30,599
Yeah, it was really weird. It smelled like

1250
04:52:31,560 --> 04:52:39,799
shit, it was one of those cases where be very careful when you go shopping for body wash

1251
04:52:40,439 --> 04:52:46,439
Because sometimes you'll be there and you'll you pop it open you and whatever you'd like to smell right or like

1252
04:52:46,439 --> 04:52:51,040
How's this one's does this one smell? Okay, right? Don't trust that

1253
04:52:51,639 --> 04:53:03,380
Don't ever trust that you get at home and it smells terrible. Oh my god

1254
04:53:04,340 --> 04:53:08,340
Okay

1255
04:53:08,340 --> 04:53:28,000
Within the hot shower that gets gross go there you liked it because it's felt like shit. Oh

1256
04:53:32,900 --> 04:53:37,770
It's concentrated form smelled. Okay

1257
04:53:38,689 --> 04:53:46,389
When it was heated up, it smelled pretty awful. That's a legendary item. By the way, look at that. That's legendary beam

1258
04:53:46,790 --> 04:54:11,840
I'm gonna have to come from another way. Oh my god scared me

1259
04:54:12,439 --> 04:54:23,279
Okay. Well, whatever am I gonna beat the final boss this stream? Probably not

1260
04:54:23,919 --> 04:54:37,729
One of these okay. Whoa, my goodness. That was okay. That was like in real life when a bug flies next your head

1261
04:54:37,729 --> 04:54:41,029
I was about to just dash out of the room

1262
04:54:41,590 --> 04:54:44,529
Are you gonna at least attempt it?

1263
04:54:44,529 --> 04:54:46,689
Yeah, I don't want to go to too late

1264
04:54:47,490 --> 04:54:50,759
Right, I don't want to just I don't want to go so late

1265
04:54:51,560 --> 04:55:05,229
Depending how long this takes me. I might try like once or twice

1266
04:55:05,950 --> 04:55:12,759
then now I'll actually only have one thing left to do in the game and then we'll do that and then I'll start the like

1267
04:55:13,040 --> 04:55:15,340
PvP night like the invasion night

1268
04:55:16,159 --> 04:55:20,799
Where I invade your game potentially or maybe you summon me and I help you beat

1269
04:55:21,599 --> 04:55:23,599
That piece of shit boss

1270
04:55:23,840 --> 04:55:27,229
You probably combine those creeps together

1271
04:55:33,950 --> 04:55:36,110
River of blood exploit night. No, we'll have rules

1272
04:55:36,830 --> 04:55:39,659
We will ban weapons and if you use them

1273
04:55:40,299 --> 04:55:58,779
You are excommunicated from the community fuck. That's like a minecraft chunk error

1274
04:56:03,200 --> 04:56:04,080
Whoa

1275
04:56:04,080 --> 04:56:15,659
There's a finger reader here. You're good

1276
04:56:56,599 --> 04:56:58,599
I

1277
04:57:08,139 --> 04:57:23,950
What are the two fingers oh

1278
04:57:25,790 --> 04:57:47,869
I think I can level up. They're just an alien radio antenna. Why make them a hand? Why make them

1279
04:57:54,240 --> 04:58:30,169
They're markers down here. What markers do I have here? I don't have any markers. What's that weird? Oh

1280
04:58:30,650 --> 04:58:42,349
Nope ghost level up work five could have used that

1281
04:58:43,389 --> 04:58:51,470
Why let go?

1282
04:58:51,470 --> 04:58:55,150
Oh shit, that's a that's that's quite a congregation of those

1283
04:58:56,110 --> 04:59:09,610
Right so hard, but i'm just way stronger than you. Good try though

1284
04:59:10,569 --> 04:59:16,009
Is it only one?

1285
04:59:16,009 --> 04:59:18,009
That breathes fire. Whatever fucking i'm over leveled

1286
04:59:18,650 --> 04:59:37,849
Astro for vacuum slice. I already have that

1287
04:59:38,569 --> 04:59:43,630
There's not much down here climb the tree

1288
04:59:44,029 --> 04:59:51,740
Let's check

1289
04:59:51,740 --> 04:59:56,909
He's the guy live

1290
04:59:56,909 --> 04:59:59,790
He beat millennia. I did

1291
04:59:59,790 --> 05:00:05,630
I got very lucky. I used a very powerful summon. I didn't use the mimicked here, but I used like the second best

1292
05:00:06,669 --> 05:00:08,669
Summon for that boss

1293
05:00:11,069 --> 05:00:25,560
Oh, there's a map oh shit cool fisha is better than the mimic

1294
05:00:37,659 --> 05:00:42,119
Okay, go all the way west. Yeah

1295
05:00:43,479 --> 05:00:44,599
Is that a

1296
05:00:44,599 --> 05:01:00,169
Three sentinel

1297
05:01:00,169 --> 05:01:09,900
Oh, he's up there. All right

1298
05:01:09,979 --> 05:01:49,209
Oh, come on

1299
05:01:50,009 --> 05:02:09,150
What's happening with the sound

1300
05:02:09,150 --> 05:02:19,819
What's wrong? What was harder millennia or the last little of simpsons hit and run millennia?

1301
05:02:20,619 --> 05:02:36,319
A hundred times and I mean I mean 100 out of 100 times. It's bullshit. No, it's not

1302
05:02:38,560 --> 05:02:42,380
That's the truth

1303
05:02:42,380 --> 05:02:44,380
last level the two towers

1304
05:02:45,180 --> 05:02:47,180
That was fucking awful, too

1305
05:02:48,330 --> 05:02:52,569
So what tree is this if this is here then this is the ur tree, right? These are the

1306
05:02:53,130 --> 05:02:55,130
It's like the roots of the ur tree

1307
05:02:57,209 --> 05:03:00,009
Right, this is the ur tree. Why does it look all fucked up down here?

1308
05:03:00,650 --> 05:03:04,240
Everything looks like all poisoned shitty

1309
05:03:18,889 --> 05:03:19,770
cool

1310
05:03:19,770 --> 05:03:27,680
Because you burnt it

1311
05:03:27,680 --> 05:03:32,569
I didn't a lot of ruins over here

1312
05:03:35,319 --> 05:03:37,319
clarifying clarified butter

1313
05:03:37,979 --> 05:03:40,830
You have to get in that

1314
05:03:40,830 --> 05:04:35,959
Well, there's an omega knight in here fresh on his mind. I wonder if he'll change his mind about it being 100 times harder

1315
05:04:37,080 --> 05:04:40,520
Past your bedtime it is but i'm close to completing

1316
05:04:41,639 --> 05:04:48,080
elden ring

1317
05:04:48,080 --> 05:04:50,400
We'll see how tired i'm i'll take a break after this fight

1318
05:04:50,799 --> 05:04:55,080
This is definitely a fight down here. Why would you tell me to come down here if there wasn't let me look over here

1319
05:05:07,040 --> 05:05:10,240
Oh my god, it's a boss. Oh, I did not think you were you're gonna be here

1320
05:05:19,119 --> 05:05:23,599
Get it

1321
05:05:29,790 --> 05:05:32,220
Got you

1322
05:05:38,970 --> 05:05:43,840
Celurias tree so this is this is another person's tree

1323
05:05:44,619 --> 05:06:02,590
Celuria

1324
05:06:02,590 --> 05:06:19,900
Whoa crucible tree armor. Holy shit come with the crucible knights who served godfrey the first elden lord

1325
05:06:20,540 --> 05:06:22,040
the great tree

1326
05:06:22,040 --> 05:06:24,299
ornamentation is the knight celurias mark

1327
05:06:24,860 --> 05:06:26,779
Displayed also by her men

1328
05:06:26,779 --> 05:06:32,779
Holds the power of the crucible of life the primordial form of the urd tree strengthens aspects of the crucible incantations

1329
05:06:33,419 --> 05:06:43,709
This is pretty good

1330
05:06:43,709 --> 05:06:45,950
You only read mean messages. No, I don't think so

1331
05:06:46,750 --> 05:06:50,720
It's like 4 a.m. I am pacific

1332
05:06:51,200 --> 05:06:54,330
Yes, t

1333
05:06:54,330 --> 05:07:01,950
I'm gonna take a quick gander over here

1334
05:07:02,110 --> 05:07:17,900
And we'll go in the coffin. Well, I thought that was a turtle

1335
05:07:18,779 --> 05:07:29,369
There's a bell

1336
05:07:29,369 --> 05:07:33,150
There's one of those bell things here

1337
05:07:36,009 --> 05:07:37,930
down there

1338
05:07:37,930 --> 05:07:51,720
Damn, I don't have an item. All right, be careful

1339
05:07:56,060 --> 05:07:58,060
Oh shit. Cool. All right

1340
05:08:05,950 --> 05:08:08,110
They give you a lot of those uh resemblances

1341
05:08:09,069 --> 05:08:13,869
I don't really care for it right now, but it's cool

1342
05:08:28,810 --> 05:08:31,159
Interesting

1343
05:08:31,159 --> 05:08:32,759
very interesting

1344
05:08:32,759 --> 05:08:34,619
Okay

1345
05:08:34,619 --> 05:08:48,799
What's that part of this mausoleum soldier ashes? Okay, that's cool. I actually want to look at those

1346
05:08:50,729 --> 05:08:59,869
All right coffin time

1347
05:08:59,869 --> 05:09:04,110
A lot of spitting stones here if you're looking for spitting stones five six four five six. There's a shitload here

1348
05:09:07,680 --> 05:09:16,319
Back to the coffin, please don't

1349
05:09:22,159 --> 05:09:23,520
I hear a twinkle

1350
05:09:23,520 --> 05:09:25,689
Uh-huh

1351
05:09:25,689 --> 05:09:34,650
So spitting those I'm not spitting so whatever

1352
05:09:35,290 --> 05:09:37,450
I know the words i'm trying to say it's not coming out right

1353
05:09:40,639 --> 05:09:43,520
Often no, no, no coffin. No not in the coffin

1354
05:09:45,479 --> 05:09:47,959
Up the roots like up here. This is where i'm going

1355
05:09:48,680 --> 05:09:57,560
We're losing them. Am I going the right way?

1356
05:09:59,659 --> 05:10:02,220
Other roots up the roots near the coffin

1357
05:10:12,720 --> 05:10:14,720
Back where the gargoyle was spitting fire at you. Okay

1358
05:10:24,250 --> 05:10:29,130
Don't go in the coffin

1359
05:10:29,130 --> 05:10:35,869
go over there

1360
05:10:35,869 --> 05:10:37,869
backseaters, that's okay, uh, i'm

1361
05:10:38,349 --> 05:10:40,349
actually thankful for the backseaters

1362
05:10:41,259 --> 05:10:43,919
because

1363
05:10:43,919 --> 05:10:48,319
It's getting late and not that I want I don't want to rush through the game. Not a million years

1364
05:10:49,439 --> 05:10:51,680
But it's getting late and I kind of want to see what's down here

1365
05:10:52,400 --> 05:11:16,700
You're saying over here

1366
05:11:16,700 --> 05:11:19,979
there

1367
05:11:19,979 --> 05:11:33,069
Don't help him. No help

1368
05:11:33,069 --> 05:11:43,819
Probably go from here. Um

1369
05:11:55,389 --> 05:11:56,909
I don't think so

1370
05:11:56,909 --> 05:12:07,560
You're

1371
05:12:07,560 --> 05:12:10,840
No, no, no nodders. Don't cough in my face

1372
05:12:14,159 --> 05:12:16,720
Didn't mean to

1373
05:12:16,720 --> 05:12:18,720
Oh up there

1374
05:12:33,099 --> 05:12:35,099
Two fingers stand for peace

1375
05:12:35,259 --> 05:12:38,080
Well, hi, Mr. Litherin

1376
05:12:38,080 --> 05:12:45,799
I don't want that ending

1377
05:12:45,799 --> 05:12:47,080
Oh shit

1378
05:12:47,080 --> 05:12:53,680
How far do I have to go?

1379
05:13:02,430 --> 05:13:04,430
There oh shit

1380
05:13:06,159 --> 05:13:08,479
All the way

1381
05:13:08,479 --> 05:13:10,479
All the way i'm going all the way

1382
05:13:11,770 --> 05:13:13,049
Oh boy

1383
05:13:13,049 --> 05:13:14,889
Oh shit

1384
05:13:14,889 --> 05:13:30,169
Okay

1385
05:13:30,169 --> 05:13:37,319
Why don't I get off the horse?

1386
05:13:49,659 --> 05:14:15,919
This looks like a boss area. What the hell is this?

1387
05:14:26,750 --> 05:14:30,619
That wouldn't happen in real life. If you step on a

1388
05:14:31,259 --> 05:14:33,259
Branch it doesn't explode

1389
05:14:40,159 --> 05:14:42,159
How close do I have to get to this thing?

1390
05:14:48,959 --> 05:14:52,799
What the fuck?

1391
05:14:52,799 --> 05:14:54,669
Oh, no

1392
05:14:54,669 --> 05:14:57,720
It's

1393
05:14:57,720 --> 05:15:04,889
A little shit guy

1394
05:15:04,889 --> 05:15:06,330
Oh, no

1395
05:15:06,330 --> 05:15:14,189
You know i'm gonna let you hit me three times

1396
05:15:14,189 --> 05:15:16,479
two

1397
05:15:16,479 --> 05:15:18,159
Three, okay

1398
05:15:18,159 --> 05:15:21,310
That was four

1399
05:15:21,310 --> 05:15:25,240
That's about enough for you

1400
05:15:25,240 --> 05:15:30,669
So you let a dickhead

1401
05:15:30,669 --> 05:15:42,479
burn

1402
05:15:42,479 --> 05:15:55,720
Got a better idea

1403
05:15:55,720 --> 05:15:58,759
Roger

1404
05:15:58,759 --> 05:16:00,599
What is he doing here? What?

1405
05:16:00,599 --> 05:16:07,880
I don't want to fight roger

1406
05:16:07,880 --> 05:16:14,909
Why bro, they hate you. What did I do? I didn't do anything wrong

1407
05:16:17,610 --> 05:16:20,650
Roger you're still using spells with my level 15 buddy

1408
05:16:22,009 --> 05:16:24,330
It seems the student has become the master

1409
05:16:25,049 --> 05:16:27,610
I hate the way my face looks sometimes

1410
05:16:35,159 --> 05:16:37,319
It seems the student has become the master

1411
05:16:37,959 --> 05:16:42,970
This guy worked for fear. No way

1412
05:16:51,200 --> 05:16:53,200
All right. Who's next in like the fucking?

1413
05:16:53,759 --> 05:16:57,630
gauntlet

1414
05:16:57,630 --> 05:16:59,389
This is okay

1415
05:16:59,389 --> 05:17:01,840
bro, why

1416
05:17:01,840 --> 05:17:03,840
What if lionel the lionheart?

1417
05:17:04,560 --> 05:17:07,840
Fias champ, why am I what's happening? Why is everybody ganging up on me?

1418
05:17:08,400 --> 05:17:16,139
That guy in one swing

1419
05:17:17,020 --> 05:17:18,860
That was somebody's little brother

1420
05:17:18,860 --> 05:17:20,860
You could tell he was wearing the pumpkin head

1421
05:17:21,180 --> 05:17:25,759
Nobody puts that on unless you're like you unless you're like 14

1422
05:17:26,319 --> 05:17:50,509
He's away from me. I might have to kind of like five people at the same time. Lionel is fat rolling

1423
05:17:51,229 --> 05:17:57,529
Is that it?

1424
05:17:57,529 --> 05:18:01,520
He is missed

1425
05:18:01,520 --> 05:18:04,080
Honest to god, what the fuck is that?

1426
05:18:18,939 --> 05:18:20,779
This looks like me

1427
05:18:20,779 --> 05:18:32,860
That's horrifying

1428
05:18:32,860 --> 05:18:46,240
Pumpkin heads actually like pretty good item

1429
05:18:46,479 --> 05:18:47,680
That was rude

1430
05:18:47,680 --> 05:19:12,650
What is it you intend to deny us golden order? I don't even know what they want

1431
05:19:15,580 --> 05:19:17,580
I actually don't know what they want

1432
05:19:20,680 --> 05:19:26,189
Everybody speaks in riddles in these games. Oh, does thou want thy golden finger?

1433
05:19:26,830 --> 05:19:31,040
What is what do you what do you want?

1434
05:19:31,119 --> 05:19:33,119
My lord doth how destined death?

1435
05:19:33,840 --> 05:19:39,020
Okay, I want to be held

1436
05:19:49,209 --> 05:19:57,259
They call yet. You still wish to be held by me. Well, I want the item you're gonna give me then i'm gonna kill you

1437
05:20:12,490 --> 05:20:23,240
Fuckin secret. Have you ever seen a hand when the first demigods flesh was marked with the half-wheel wound of the centipede?

1438
05:20:23,880 --> 05:20:27,959
Godwin's halibrand has since been recovered at the round table

1439
05:20:28,680 --> 05:20:43,959
But there is another halibrand somewhere before the time comes we receive our lord when godwin died

1440
05:20:44,599 --> 05:20:46,840
A halibrand scored his flesh

1441
05:20:47,400 --> 05:20:49,400
But another exists

1442
05:20:49,479 --> 05:20:53,630
Another mark in the shape of the half-wheel wound of the centipede

1443
05:20:54,270 --> 05:20:58,860
Must find it before the time comes we receive our lord

1444
05:20:59,580 --> 05:21:05,099
My hands will be dirtied once more by the deed will you still let me hold you

1445
05:21:09,849 --> 05:21:11,849
Oh, I have I have this

1446
05:21:12,409 --> 05:21:14,409
Give curse mark of death

1447
05:21:25,580 --> 05:21:27,580
This is the this is ranny's curse mark

1448
05:21:31,439 --> 05:21:37,790
This is the other halibrand how did you most thanks?

1449
05:21:38,430 --> 05:21:39,869
with this

1450
05:21:39,869 --> 05:21:44,990
Godwin can take his rightful place as first of the dead to get up and claim a second

1451
05:21:45,709 --> 05:21:51,069
Illustrious life wait i'm about i'm about to bring godwin back to life our true champion

1452
05:22:04,220 --> 05:22:06,299
Radiant baldichin's blessing

1453
05:22:12,349 --> 05:22:22,430
The new life of those who live in death

1454
05:22:28,360 --> 05:22:36,330
And take for yourself the throne stay the persecution of those who live in death

1455
05:22:36,970 --> 05:22:46,110
By becoming I will soon to conceal my own stay the ruin

1456
05:22:46,189 --> 05:22:48,779
I become

1457
05:22:48,779 --> 05:22:50,139
They get a rune

1458
05:22:50,139 --> 05:22:53,080
How are you gonna lay with godwin?

1459
05:22:53,560 --> 05:22:56,000
He's like a big

1460
05:22:56,000 --> 05:22:58,000
He's like a big cheeseburger

1461
05:22:58,000 --> 05:23:32,479
You grow hair

1462
05:23:32,479 --> 05:23:35,279
No, no, that's just sap. That's just sap. That's sap

1463
05:23:47,630 --> 05:23:50,599
What would be golden?

1464
05:23:50,599 --> 05:24:05,040
Us killed this is goodbye. I choose to lie with god or a child

1465
05:24:08,669 --> 05:24:15,610
What greater blessing could there be to be born? What are you gonna?

1466
05:24:16,330 --> 05:24:21,630
This is goodbye, but I am sad I choose and I will be willing what greater

1467
05:24:24,479 --> 05:24:42,240
How how

1468
05:24:42,240 --> 05:24:43,520
What is that?

1469
05:24:43,520 --> 05:24:46,200
That looks like a like dragon

1470
05:24:46,799 --> 05:25:05,709
scales

1471
05:25:05,709 --> 05:25:16,619
Enter the deathbed dream. This is fucking weird

1472
05:25:36,380 --> 05:25:38,380
Let's dragon portis axe

1473
05:25:41,560 --> 05:26:08,200
What

1474
05:26:08,200 --> 05:26:12,830
He's so overleveled for this feels pretty good after millennia. I'll tell you

1475
05:26:32,590 --> 05:26:38,250
Shit

1476
05:26:38,250 --> 05:26:58,409
Wow. Oh, that's death flight. That's hell

1477
05:27:11,180 --> 05:27:13,279
remembrance of the lich dragon

1478
05:27:13,919 --> 05:27:22,729
Holy shit that was yeah, that was 3k a swing

1479
05:27:42,029 --> 05:27:44,029
Mending rune of the death prince

1480
05:27:44,590 --> 05:27:54,189
Excuse me

1481
05:27:54,189 --> 05:28:05,979
Can be used to mend the shattered elden ring formed of the two hallowbrand half wheels combined

1482
05:28:06,060 --> 05:28:08,459
It will embed the principle of life within death

1483
05:28:09,020 --> 05:28:10,619
into order

1484
05:28:10,619 --> 05:28:13,180
That feels like an ai generated sentence. Let me read that again

1485
05:28:14,060 --> 05:28:16,779
Formed of the two hallowbrand half wheels combined

1486
05:28:17,500 --> 05:28:21,259
It will embed the principle of life within death into order

1487
05:28:22,060 --> 05:28:28,090
Golden order was created by confining destined death

1488
05:28:28,889 --> 05:28:32,169
Thus this new order will be one of death restored

1489
05:28:32,889 --> 05:28:39,630
What does that mean?

1490
05:28:39,630 --> 05:28:45,360
I now have the whole elden ring. I should be able just to put it all together and just eat it

1491
05:28:48,250 --> 05:28:50,090
That's cold. Oh that fight

1492
05:28:50,090 --> 05:28:56,729
Would have been a how come this is not on cannot be used

1493
05:28:57,369 --> 05:29:02,520
Why not this guy I swear to god?

1494
05:29:03,240 --> 05:29:16,860
Okay

1495
05:29:16,860 --> 05:29:18,860
He is hood. He is robe

1496
05:29:21,770 --> 05:29:25,790
Very confused

1497
05:29:25,790 --> 05:29:26,909
He is hood

1498
05:29:26,909 --> 05:29:33,360
Put a black cloth that covers the whole head one by fear the deathbed companion on her journey after being exiled from her home

1499
05:29:33,360 --> 05:29:35,360
The fabric itself is a soft silk

1500
05:29:35,439 --> 05:29:50,090
It was a shit

1501
05:29:50,090 --> 05:29:52,090
Curse mark is your baby

1502
05:29:52,330 --> 05:29:55,659
Put away those baldkins blessings

1503
05:29:56,299 --> 05:29:59,369
Yeah, I got a super one

1504
05:29:59,369 --> 05:30:01,849
Used to use fp to temporarily boost poise

1505
05:30:02,569 --> 05:30:05,959
Okay

1506
05:30:05,959 --> 05:30:07,959
Blessings of the utmost rarity

1507
05:30:08,040 --> 05:30:15,479
It said a deathbed companion will only produce a blessing of this kind for a champion, but once in her entire life

1508
05:30:16,360 --> 05:30:18,840
Soul blessing which she imbues of her own volition

1509
05:30:19,560 --> 05:30:22,380
This is just the shitty one

1510
05:30:22,619 --> 05:30:33,759
I can't be used

1511
05:30:33,759 --> 05:30:35,919
Gives it more max hp forever

1512
05:30:36,560 --> 05:30:38,860
Is it actually

1513
05:30:38,860 --> 05:30:41,880
Are you fuck are you fucking?

1514
05:30:41,880 --> 05:30:53,240
Are you kidding me kidding me? Let's get to 60. Oh

1515
05:30:57,209 --> 05:30:59,209
Daddy's here. No way really

1516
05:31:00,060 --> 05:31:01,340
Daddy's here

1517
05:31:01,340 --> 05:31:12,270
What's up, man? I love your videos

1518
05:31:12,509 --> 05:31:16,639
Time to get all your lore questions answered

1519
05:31:17,200 --> 05:31:19,450
Daddy daddy

1520
05:31:19,450 --> 05:31:32,840
I'll just tell you take your time. Take your time. It's probably an incredible amount of pressure

1521
05:31:34,009 --> 05:31:36,169
Uh need to come out with some of these videos

1522
05:31:37,130 --> 05:31:38,569
Take your time

1523
05:31:38,569 --> 05:31:39,610
We'll wait

1524
05:31:39,610 --> 05:31:49,880
We'll wait the amount of shit to piece together that i've been seeing from tons of people in the community

1525
05:31:51,119 --> 05:31:56,959
People are still kind of trying to guess what things even mean or what this place actually means

1526
05:31:57,040 --> 05:32:00,560
So this is oh, I found this I found that it's still happening a month later

1527
05:32:02,619 --> 05:32:05,180
Don't feel too much pressure. Seriously, like we can wait

1528
05:32:08,560 --> 05:32:12,040
Very excited though

1529
05:32:12,040 --> 05:32:14,040
Truly truly love your videos. I really do

1530
05:32:14,759 --> 05:32:26,840
Thanks for um stopping by. Can you give us a sneak peek? What the

1531
05:32:27,479 --> 05:32:28,840
the hornblowers

1532
05:32:28,840 --> 05:32:30,810
What are those?

1533
05:32:30,810 --> 05:32:33,529
aliens

1534
05:32:33,529 --> 05:32:35,549
What are the hornblowers?

1535
05:32:35,549 --> 05:32:38,029
Whose fingers are those whose fingers are those?

1536
05:32:38,750 --> 05:32:40,990
Can you give us a little um, give us up small

1537
05:32:41,630 --> 05:32:44,970
Why is there gold shit everywhere this gold dung?

1538
05:32:48,509 --> 05:32:51,229
Everything's gold is the gold ship. Why is there two fingers?

1539
05:32:51,869 --> 05:32:56,110
Okay

1540
05:32:56,110 --> 05:32:58,110
No, i'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding

1541
05:32:59,680 --> 05:33:01,680
He probably gets this shit everywhere

1542
05:33:02,240 --> 05:33:05,439
Like all that he's here

1543
05:33:05,439 --> 05:33:11,279
Explain in in minute detail, uh incredibly intricate stuff that takes like an hour to explain in five seconds

1544
05:33:11,919 --> 05:33:15,040
What does that mean daddy? Like he probably gets his fucking everywhere

1545
05:33:19,439 --> 05:33:21,439
No, uh, it's cool to see you here

1546
05:33:22,080 --> 05:33:24,779
He left

1547
05:33:26,189 --> 05:33:29,389
All right. Well, uh, should I try to beat the last boss? Should I go for it?

1548
05:33:30,029 --> 05:33:45,959
Let's do it. Let's see if I can do it. Oh the coffin. Where does the coffin go?

1549
05:33:52,080 --> 05:33:53,580
Ah the

1550
05:33:53,580 --> 05:33:54,799
remembrances

1551
05:33:54,799 --> 05:33:56,080
right

1552
05:33:56,080 --> 05:34:01,689
If I can pick this up

1553
05:34:01,689 --> 05:34:08,650
After godwin the golden became the prince of death the ancient dragon fought long and hard against the death within its companion

1554
05:34:09,529 --> 05:34:13,849
Alas victory was victory was never achieved and its only reward was corruption

1555
05:34:15,290 --> 05:34:21,049
I think those two fingers are giants. I think they're a giant species of giants and they were killed

1556
05:34:21,849 --> 05:34:25,849
And they only have like hands remaining and they try and they can communicate with the golden order

1557
05:34:26,490 --> 05:34:33,959
I also think that there's two fingers and there's apparently three fingers

1558
05:34:34,599 --> 05:34:38,599
Excuse me. Excuse me. How much does that make?

1559
05:34:39,419 --> 05:34:41,240
Excuse me

1560
05:34:41,240 --> 05:34:46,860
One two, three, four five. Excuse me. That was a whole hand at some point. That's five fingers

1561
05:34:47,419 --> 05:35:04,700
Excuse me

1562
05:35:04,700 --> 05:35:06,860
and why did these

1563
05:35:06,860 --> 05:35:08,860
Why did these fuck off and never come back?

1564
05:35:09,709 --> 05:35:14,270
You would think that the whole world being changed. They'd be like, you know what come out of sleep mode. I don't understand

1565
05:35:14,830 --> 05:35:21,369
odd really

1566
05:35:21,369 --> 05:35:25,049
Fortisax lightning spear and death lightning

1567
05:35:26,860 --> 05:35:29,119
47 faith

1568
05:35:29,119 --> 05:35:30,880
That's probably so cool

1569
05:35:30,880 --> 05:35:46,669
They said this golden lightning was wielded by godwin who befriended fortisax. So why do we just kill fortisax?

1570
05:35:48,669 --> 05:35:50,669
Just eat it. You know, you're going to anyways

1571
05:35:53,689 --> 05:35:55,229
What level am I?

1572
05:35:55,229 --> 05:35:57,229
I am 150 exactly

1573
05:35:58,650 --> 05:36:01,849
We have we are going to probably end the game at 150

1574
05:36:02,409 --> 05:36:07,470
It depends on how if I can actually beat this or not

1575
05:36:07,869 --> 05:36:12,459
All right. Let me give it a good try

1576
05:36:12,459 --> 05:36:26,110
It is late. I don't have to beat it tonight. I am going to

1577
05:36:27,069 --> 05:36:28,650
You're gonna remember the

1578
05:36:28,650 --> 05:36:30,650
Radigan fight because you have to do that first

1579
05:36:31,130 --> 05:36:32,430
Let's go

1580
05:36:32,430 --> 05:36:42,009
Can we break? Here comes the cool music

1581
05:36:42,650 --> 05:36:46,669
Here we go

1582
05:36:46,669 --> 05:36:55,380
final fight

1583
05:36:55,380 --> 05:36:57,439
tarnished

1584
05:36:57,439 --> 05:36:59,439
In search of the elden ring

1585
05:36:59,840 --> 05:37:03,040
Must extinguish thy flame

1586
05:37:04,000 --> 05:37:08,590
of ambition

1587
05:37:08,590 --> 05:37:55,000
begin

1588
05:37:55,000 --> 05:37:57,000
Oh you do another one fuck

1589
05:37:57,240 --> 05:38:03,130
Oh my god, I thought I'd punch me in the face

1590
05:38:03,610 --> 05:38:04,729
I thought I could

1591
05:38:04,729 --> 05:38:15,470
All right. Well, that's been a while. I haven't played this in a while. I haven't played against fucking

1592
05:38:16,189 --> 05:38:24,139
Radigan in a while. I'm so busy fighting millennia of just panicking and dodging every five seconds

1593
05:38:25,479 --> 05:38:33,159
I'll get it. I'll get it. Does that mean

1594
05:38:40,009 --> 05:38:42,009
That happens really quickly

1595
05:38:47,389 --> 05:38:49,389
I try jump if he does that

1596
05:38:49,979 --> 05:38:51,979
You know, I never learned his entire move set

1597
05:38:53,560 --> 05:38:55,639
I literally just summoned somebody and freaked up

1598
05:38:56,439 --> 05:39:18,569
I think you just have to stay close to him

1599
05:39:18,569 --> 05:39:20,569
This also is definitely not a place to have

1600
05:39:21,849 --> 05:39:23,849
Like seven flasks. I need all of them

1601
05:39:30,009 --> 05:39:31,049
also

1602
05:39:31,049 --> 05:39:33,049
Why am I not just using this?

1603
05:39:34,080 --> 05:39:37,560
That was real dumb

1604
05:39:37,560 --> 05:39:39,880
How would I ever use that on the move? It takes way too long

1605
05:39:40,520 --> 05:39:47,209
What can happen? What the fuck happened?

1606
05:39:49,279 --> 05:39:55,630
What happened? He's deflecting. Oh, that's what's going on

1607
05:39:59,759 --> 05:40:03,040
He's deflecting the magic and throwing it back

1608
05:40:04,409 --> 05:40:06,270
Okay

1609
05:40:06,270 --> 05:40:08,270
All right. All right

1610
05:40:08,590 --> 05:40:28,349
I'll get it. So let's just beat the shit out of him. He can't do that to the moon

1611
05:40:31,799 --> 05:40:33,400
Use the laser beam

1612
05:40:33,400 --> 05:40:35,819
What if he just deflects a thousand open row and kills me one hit?

1613
05:40:37,529 --> 05:40:42,599
Try it

1614
05:40:42,599 --> 05:40:44,599
Hold y and press r1

1615
05:40:44,840 --> 05:41:08,509
It's too late now. No, I'm just gonna beat him up

1616
05:41:09,310 --> 05:41:12,349
I did I didn't shoot any spells at him. What the fuck was that bullshit?

1617
05:41:23,130 --> 05:41:26,729
God damn it

1618
05:41:26,729 --> 05:41:31,450
I think I fucking expelled every ounce of gamer juice on on four hours of millennia

1619
05:41:44,080 --> 05:41:50,700
Where are you?

1620
05:41:50,700 --> 05:42:01,580
piece of shit

1621
05:42:01,580 --> 05:42:45,549
Fucking baby route sucks absolute balls like oh my god that hits with every other weapon in the game

1622
05:42:46,430 --> 05:42:53,740
What he's I gotta get around him behind him. I'm dead

1623
05:42:54,299 --> 05:43:06,110
Yeah, you gotta get behind him

1624
05:43:06,110 --> 05:43:12,000
Dude, fuck off

1625
05:43:12,000 --> 05:43:15,040
I didn't want to jump my fat fucking fingers hit it

1626
05:43:20,299 --> 05:43:22,299
You gotta get

1627
05:43:22,619 --> 05:43:46,569
Flail sucks the flail has like a hitbox of like

1628
05:43:47,689 --> 05:43:48,970
here

1629
05:43:48,970 --> 05:43:50,560
it's like

1630
05:43:50,560 --> 05:43:55,599
Here it's literally the hitbox of the flail is like fucking four inches in front of you. It's like

1631
05:44:02,250 --> 05:44:04,250
Elden ring sucks elden ring sucks

1632
05:44:04,970 --> 05:44:16,409
Get this fucking item off. It's the goddamn last boss of the game. You know, who cares?

1633
05:44:45,759 --> 05:44:56,360
He caught it almost all of that. Oh my goodness. He did it twice

1634
05:45:09,959 --> 05:45:11,560
It really makes you feel like you know, did bring you know

1635
05:45:11,560 --> 05:45:25,439
I mean really makes you feel like everything actually was a good strap you can summon

1636
05:45:25,520 --> 05:46:02,439
I want to summon it at the second phase. I think that actually kind of worked. No

1637
05:46:03,479 --> 05:46:47,799
I don't fucking know what to do. Oh my god

1638
05:46:49,529 --> 05:46:52,409
I gotta go behind him. Stop dodging back you fucking idiot

1639
05:46:53,049 --> 05:47:05,979
I didn't mean to press that button and damn it. Fuck the last three bosses of this game

1640
05:47:06,779 --> 05:47:25,900
I gotta start off

1641
05:47:25,979 --> 05:47:30,439
But you don't like aoe spam bosses

1642
05:47:31,240 --> 05:47:32,889
No

1643
05:47:32,889 --> 05:47:34,889
No, I don't no, I don't

1644
05:47:40,939 --> 05:47:52,700
Underleveled what i'm level 150. What do you it's easy to dodge all of his attacks

1645
05:47:53,259 --> 05:48:18,270
Just fucking didn't bring tish in your pocket. What are you talking about?

1646
05:48:50,560 --> 05:48:53,240
What I dodged it

1647
05:48:58,840 --> 05:49:01,159
Teach you and I are good friends

1648
05:49:01,880 --> 05:49:14,200
I've never seen this part

1649
05:49:14,200 --> 05:49:22,119
I know what happens here l plus over level plus still losing plus using the katana plus using comet azor plus ratio

1650
05:49:23,080 --> 05:49:33,740
Let's go, let's do it again. This is fucking who cares

1651
05:49:42,520 --> 05:49:54,959
Where where what's going on? Oh my god, what how do I do this? What do I do?

1652
05:50:03,360 --> 05:50:21,439
I'm being such a fucking idiot right now. He's confirmed better player by the way. Oh my god. What does that mean?

1653
05:50:41,869 --> 05:50:44,060
Whoa

1654
05:50:44,060 --> 05:50:48,619
What the fuck man? It's like i'm on the highway and i'm walking the opposite side of the highway

1655
05:50:48,939 --> 05:50:51,180
This is a car's driving at me 100 miles per hour

1656
05:50:57,400 --> 05:51:01,389
Oh god, damn it

1657
05:51:01,389 --> 05:51:12,799
You just run

1658
05:51:12,799 --> 05:51:16,720
Holy shit

1659
05:51:16,720 --> 05:51:18,720
I'm just doing it. I don't even care

1660
05:51:18,880 --> 05:51:31,290
Is this hitting?

1661
05:51:51,020 --> 05:51:53,200
Holy fuck oh fuck

1662
05:51:54,490 --> 05:51:56,009
Get it away from me

1663
05:51:56,009 --> 05:52:07,099
Get it away from me

1664
05:52:07,099 --> 05:52:21,020
What the fuck have the from software devs been playing overwatch recently?

1665
05:52:23,180 --> 05:52:26,459
Do they like that game? Is that a is that a with their favorite game?

1666
05:52:27,099 --> 05:52:37,060
I just like you're just filling my screen with just colors

1667
05:52:43,560 --> 05:52:46,759
It's like what the fuck is happening this is five people altered at the same time

1668
05:52:47,400 --> 05:53:22,349
Oh, I didn't even fucking go this way

1669
05:53:40,009 --> 05:53:43,130
My fucking hand is so sweaty. You can sometimes you can't even press the button

1670
05:53:58,270 --> 05:54:00,270
Don't hit me. Don't hit me. Don't hit me. Don't hit me

1671
05:54:00,349 --> 05:54:15,630
I thought he was dead

1672
05:54:15,630 --> 05:54:35,659
All right, let's go. How do you get sweaty from pressing buttons? I've been holding this control over six straight hours. Oh god

1673
05:54:36,380 --> 05:54:39,020
I'm gonna get behind him

1674
05:54:39,020 --> 05:54:41,020
No, i'm not what I don't know what to do about this

1675
05:54:47,240 --> 05:54:49,479
God, I can't fucking hit animation shit

1676
05:54:50,279 --> 05:54:59,369
Can I get on the horse? Of course not

1677
05:55:03,180 --> 05:55:05,900
I just don't get in that right? Don't let it get inside

1678
05:55:07,400 --> 05:55:08,599
I don't

1679
05:55:08,599 --> 05:55:09,799
Am I in it?

1680
05:55:09,799 --> 05:55:11,610
Do I have to jump over it?

1681
05:55:11,610 --> 05:55:39,479
I think you have to jump over it. I don't know. Oh damn it run. Oh, it's right on my heels

1682
05:55:48,990 --> 05:55:51,069
You really have to go all the fucking way over there

1683
05:55:59,389 --> 05:56:00,669
Out of stamina

1684
05:56:00,669 --> 05:56:08,909
What the fuck let me over there

1685
05:56:10,779 --> 05:56:32,909
Bastard, sorry for the language. You just I don't fucking know

1686
05:56:54,060 --> 05:56:56,700
Why do you keep fucking going away fight me?

1687
05:57:13,819 --> 05:57:15,819
Jesus christ

1688
05:57:35,119 --> 05:57:39,770
I don't

1689
05:57:39,770 --> 05:57:41,930
What the fuck come over here?

1690
05:57:42,810 --> 05:57:58,990
All right, my heels

1691
05:57:58,990 --> 05:58:08,009
I have one heel

1692
05:58:08,009 --> 05:58:13,049
Oh my goodness this fucking swing animation. All of you motherfuckers are in slow motion in this goddamn game

1693
05:58:14,009 --> 05:58:25,000
It's like everybody's in slow motion and everybody just explodes the whole fucking boss room

1694
05:58:38,159 --> 05:58:43,200
This motherfucker run. He's like, okay you get close and then he just teleports across the whole game. Where's my horse?

1695
05:58:46,029 --> 05:58:47,720
Guess what?

1696
05:58:47,720 --> 05:58:49,799
The game crashed

1697
05:58:49,799 --> 05:58:54,259
What a surprise this fucking six out of ten

1698
05:59:20,240 --> 05:59:53,049
Teleport see it run it, please come chase me. I'm gonna beat it right now. I know the game didn't I know I understand

1699
05:59:53,369 --> 06:00:10,279
I need rest. I almost just did it get rid of this fucking thing. I don't want this. I'm just using it

1700
06:00:10,360 --> 06:00:17,279
I don't want this thing in my inventory

1701
06:00:33,099 --> 06:01:14,810
Me strong exposed. Ah, damn it. I wasn't close enough. You're gonna fucking do it three times

1702
06:01:28,830 --> 06:01:30,349
Thank you tish

1703
06:01:30,349 --> 06:01:56,000
Let's go. Oh my god from software. What the fuck is that? I tried to lock on and it's

1704
06:01:56,639 --> 06:02:30,669
This is the ring. I don't get this fucking key. I think I jump. I'm gonna try jumping over it

1705
06:02:31,229 --> 06:02:33,310
I'm gonna jump over it. I'm gonna jump over it

1706
06:02:35,880 --> 06:02:45,450
Ah

1707
06:02:45,450 --> 06:02:48,810

06:02:53,599 --> 06:02:55,849
What the hell?

1710
06:02:55,849 --> 06:02:57,849
I couldn't fucking see anything

1711
06:02:58,169 --> 06:03:14,040
Was that actually the end of the look at how huge this place is

1712
06:03:27,290 --> 06:03:31,610
He dodged it. Yeah tish didn't have like gold vapor in his eyes

1713
06:03:32,860 --> 06:03:36,779
Or in her eyes. So I can't who are you? What's your name?

06:03:38,729 --> 06:03:40,250
She uh, yeah

Fucking idiot put elden beast in the meat grinder just like they just decided to just

06:04:01,740 --> 06:04:05,099
Uh, I got it. I got a pigman's but we'll talk about him later

1717
06:04:07,500 --> 06:04:52,080

1718
06:04:52,080 --> 06:04:54,080
Oh, I fucking messed it up

1719
06:04:54,400 --> 06:05:03,959
A lot of aoe spam bosses just they just shoot it and brought the whole fucking road

1720
06:05:04,840 --> 06:05:17,840
What if I happen to swinging swords at each other?

1721
06:05:18,240 --> 06:05:22,270
Does every last like three or four bosses in this game have to have a fucking

1722
06:05:22,909 --> 06:05:24,909
bomb that a bomb

1723
06:05:25,229 --> 06:05:47,340
An over and over again fucking missile. I can't even hear the music over it

1724
06:05:48,159 --> 06:05:50,319
You're just dropping fucking missiles, man

1725
06:05:50,880 --> 06:06:31,720
I didn't think he had another attack, but how the fuck can you tell in this game?

1726
06:06:32,520 --> 06:06:36,490
You're going explosions

1727
06:06:36,729 --> 06:07:05,560
Oh fuck

1728
06:07:05,560 --> 06:07:09,080
Shaking my god damn shaking my head shaking my ss-ing my head

1729
06:07:09,720 --> 06:07:11,479
Shake shaking my head

1730
06:07:11,479 --> 06:07:30,880
I'm curious. Does this do any damage?

1731
06:07:30,959 --> 06:07:56,840
I can't even tell how far away I am from this motherfucker. I swear to god

1732
06:07:57,799 --> 06:08:40,349
All right jump over it thought I could go through it

1733
06:09:01,419 --> 06:09:03,659
Get away from me

1734
06:09:04,540 --> 06:09:06,540
You're such a fucking missile

1735
06:09:07,240 --> 06:09:09,240
Get this fucking thing away from me

1736
06:09:11,049 --> 06:09:15,209
What the fuck man, leave me. Oh my god. It's on the elden ring

1737
06:09:27,659 --> 06:09:44,639
No, what the fuck I attack him

1738
06:09:45,599 --> 06:09:59,869
I didn't want to roll that way

1739
06:10:04,009 --> 06:10:10,569
Please kill it. Please kill it. Please kill it. Please kill it

1740
06:10:39,069 --> 06:10:42,939
That was horrible

1741
06:10:42,939 --> 06:11:01,919
fractured america

1742
06:11:01,919 --> 06:11:03,439
summon ronnie

1743
06:11:03,439 --> 06:11:09,659
Oh, let me do this first

1744
06:11:09,659 --> 06:11:13,450
You know, I haven't I actually I haven't uh, there's a couple little dungeons

1745
06:11:13,450 --> 06:11:17,770
I want to do in limb grave because I didn't see what this was. I think i'm gonna go check that out

1746
06:11:21,040 --> 06:12:03,549
Summon ronnie battle is over. I see

1747
06:12:04,349 --> 06:12:33,279
He has four hands

1748
06:12:33,279 --> 06:12:51,900
I do solemnly swear

1749
06:12:54,720 --> 06:13:03,319
To every living being and every living soul now cometh the age of the stars

1750
06:13:05,119 --> 06:13:09,040
Did I make a mistake here a thousand year voyage under the wisdom of the moon

1751
06:13:11,709 --> 06:13:14,909
Here begineth the chill night that encompasses all

1752
06:13:15,869 --> 06:13:17,869
Reaching the great beyond

1753
06:13:21,880 --> 06:13:23,689
into fear

1754
06:13:23,689 --> 06:13:30,560
Doubtliness path stretcheth into darkness

1755
06:13:36,669 --> 06:14:05,959
Let us go together

1756
06:14:05,959 --> 06:14:07,959
My dear consort eternal

1757
06:14:20,270 --> 06:14:32,430
I

1758
06:14:35,400 --> 06:14:46,279
Beat the boss if I was stupid

1759
06:14:56,520 --> 06:15:08,700
He blacked out. Yeah. Wow. What did I say six out of ten? That's um, that was me being angry

1760
06:15:09,340 --> 06:15:29,560
It's way better than that. It happens what I don't get it. Heesh is the true elden lord

1761
06:15:35,709 --> 06:15:40,250
Rainy all right, what happened? Heesh literally killed the boss for you good. I'm glad

1762
06:15:43,069 --> 06:15:46,560
It's complicated

1763
06:15:46,560 --> 06:15:50,720
Rainy started a thousand years of night killing the tree and freeing the souls then okay

1764
06:15:51,439 --> 06:15:56,479
Basically give her the power and she decides to fuck off into space with you leaving the planet without a mean god to rule over it

1765
06:15:57,279 --> 06:15:59,279
No more gods people control their own lives

1766
06:16:01,080 --> 06:16:03,080
Started a new age. No more elden ring

1767
06:16:03,639 --> 06:16:06,400
You just gave them self-government

1768
06:16:08,970 --> 06:16:15,950
Huh? No more greater. No more bullshit greater will and two fingers

1769
06:16:16,750 --> 06:16:20,880
Oh who care? Yeah, fuck them. They they they they fucked off

1770
06:16:21,520 --> 06:16:24,060
halfway through the game

1771
06:16:24,060 --> 06:16:26,060
Which I don't get that either. Why do they leave?

1772
06:16:30,599 --> 06:16:33,720
They just like they went like they lost the connection to the router

1773
06:16:38,250 --> 06:16:41,159
Everyone gets free will now

1774
06:16:41,159 --> 06:16:47,689
Seems pretty good

1775
06:16:47,689 --> 06:16:49,689
the rating for the game, uh

1776
06:16:50,090 --> 06:16:52,400
It was nine point seven

1777
06:16:52,479 --> 06:16:55,520
After the millennia fight and after that fight, it's a nine point

1778
06:17:12,639 --> 06:17:18,299
nine point six

1779
06:17:18,299 --> 06:17:20,299
nine point six five

1780
06:17:20,880 --> 06:17:22,560
Nine no

1781
06:17:22,560 --> 06:17:24,639
That's not that's horseshit. It's it's higher

1782
06:17:26,639 --> 06:17:30,799
Okay, I honestly I thought these I thought this was like a kickstarter. I thought these like kickstarter people

1783
06:17:31,599 --> 06:17:36,400
There's so many names just here. I thought this was like thanking like the kickstarter people

1784
06:17:37,659 --> 06:17:39,159
um

1785
06:17:39,159 --> 06:17:41,159
Holy shit, that's a lot of names

1786
06:17:41,580 --> 06:17:43,580
Uh, it's a nine

1787
06:17:43,819 --> 06:17:45,599
It's a nine

1788
06:17:45,599 --> 06:17:47,599
The nine point eight is so simple. It's so easy

1789
06:17:57,659 --> 06:17:59,340
nine seven feels

1790
06:17:59,340 --> 06:18:02,029
Correct, but I feel like it's low

1791
06:18:02,029 --> 06:18:03,630
nine point seven eight

1792
06:18:03,630 --> 06:18:07,470
There it is a nine. It's a nine point seven eight

1793
06:18:14,840 --> 06:18:23,799
Bloodborne was a nine point four. This is better than bloodborne

1794
06:18:24,360 --> 06:18:34,939
I I think so that's slander

1795
06:18:35,580 --> 06:18:38,220
This is coming from somebody whose bloodborne has been their favorite

1796
06:18:38,939 --> 06:18:42,939
Well, it's bloodborne has been my favorite game ever all of all time since it came out

1797
06:18:43,580 --> 06:18:46,909
If bloodborne was 60 fps

1798
06:18:47,310 --> 06:18:49,310
It might be it might be a lot closer

1799
06:18:49,950 --> 06:18:51,709
nine point seven eight

1800
06:18:51,709 --> 06:18:54,909
It's it's this is so close to being a perfect game

1801
06:18:58,279 --> 06:19:02,119
And like what's the theory you think there is no such thing as a perfect thing?

1802
06:19:02,680 --> 06:19:05,799
Ten does not exist. It doesn't there's no such thing as a ten

1803
06:19:06,520 --> 06:19:12,380
And like a nine point nine feels like like horseshit, right? Like, okay, really?

1804
06:19:12,860 --> 06:19:14,860
You gave it a nine point nine

1805
06:19:18,650 --> 06:19:22,840
And doesn't mean perfect

1806
06:19:22,840 --> 06:19:25,159
It probably is a ten ask me tomorrow

1807
06:19:26,939 --> 06:19:29,099
Sekiro, I did not I was not a big fan of Sekiro

1808
06:19:29,659 --> 06:19:35,080
I thought Sekiro was good, but I I did not think it holds up to this

1809
06:19:35,639 --> 06:19:42,439
All right, ask me tomorrow. It's probably like a nine point eight seven

1810
06:19:44,729 --> 06:19:47,689
But wow, what a fucking app as a masterpiece it is

1811
06:19:48,250 --> 06:19:54,270
He said half-life alex was a nine point six

1812
06:19:55,470 --> 06:19:57,229
Yeah, and this is better

1813
06:19:57,229 --> 06:20:00,430
By a small amount. I think it is better than now half-life alex

1814
06:20:00,990 --> 06:20:07,200
Half-life alex is in a different kind of category for me though, but this this is better than half-life alex

1815
06:20:07,759 --> 06:20:15,180
Was bloodborne worse than half-life alex?

1816
06:20:16,060 --> 06:20:18,220
No, it just ran like shit

1817
06:20:20,169 --> 06:20:23,209
It just ran like shit and we can all pretend like it didn't

1818
06:20:24,889 --> 06:20:27,369
Bloodborne seriously runs like crap

1819
06:20:31,450 --> 06:20:32,889
And they did okay

1820
06:20:32,889 --> 06:20:34,569
It was on ps4

1821
06:20:34,569 --> 06:20:41,290
And they didn't even give a ps4 pro version or some anything anything to get it away from like the 28 to 30

1822
06:20:41,369 --> 06:20:43,369
FPS that it was in 25 fps

1823
06:20:45,150 --> 06:20:50,750
I just wish there was even a ps5 version for it anything anything to make that game not like 25 fps

1824
06:20:54,349 --> 06:21:00,189
This game is heavily flawed. I think you've heard me complain about half of the things that we've yeah

1825
06:21:01,759 --> 06:21:05,040
But even with a lot of this game's issues when I was like, oh, we'll talk about that later

1826
06:21:07,869 --> 06:21:10,360
for open world games

1827
06:21:10,520 --> 06:21:13,159
Nothing comes remotely close the last open

1828
06:21:13,319 --> 06:21:17,880
Look at the last open world game that you played that you gave a shit about like really beside don't say breath of the wild

1829
06:21:17,880 --> 06:21:19,240
We all know what you're gonna say

1830
06:21:19,240 --> 06:21:23,340
Forget about breath of the wild

1831
06:21:23,340 --> 06:21:27,740
I haven't given a absolute fuck about any open world game. They're all dog shit

1832
06:21:28,459 --> 06:21:31,900
I haven't played a truly good open world game in a long time red dead redemption 2 was good

1833
06:21:32,540 --> 06:21:34,540
but red dead redemption 2 felt

1834
06:21:36,880 --> 06:21:42,639
Didn't feel like this. I loved red dead redemption 2 story and its world

1835
06:21:44,380 --> 06:21:46,619
But I think this trumps it in sort of

1836
06:21:48,150 --> 06:21:49,610
gameplay

1837
06:21:49,610 --> 06:21:51,610
kind of immersion

1838
06:21:51,610 --> 06:21:53,849
red dead redemption 2 is very good don't get me wrong, but

1839
06:21:55,020 --> 06:21:57,099
I don't think it it I don't think they even compare

1840
06:21:57,819 --> 06:22:06,139
Red dead redemption 2 is a good movie

1841
06:22:06,700 --> 06:22:11,819
Yeah, I okay. I sat there with red dead redemption 2 and loved every second of it. But yeah, I was kind of just

1842
06:22:12,939 --> 06:22:14,939
trotting around on the horse and

1843
06:22:15,180 --> 06:22:17,180
talking to like dutch and

1844
06:22:17,659 --> 06:22:20,939
Crafting food and gunslinging. It was a lot different

1845
06:22:21,500 --> 06:22:23,959
Did you begin journey 2?

1846
06:22:23,959 --> 06:22:25,000
Oh, okay

1847
06:22:25,000 --> 06:22:34,680
You can do it from the round table a war open world game has not done that to me how I feel about this

1848
06:22:35,639 --> 06:22:38,750
since

1849
06:22:38,750 --> 06:22:39,950
God, I don't know

1850
06:22:39,950 --> 06:22:43,439
gta 4 maybe

1851
06:22:43,439 --> 06:22:45,259
maybe gta 5

1852
06:22:45,259 --> 06:22:52,860
But even gta 5. Yeah, I remember playing gta 5 and I was fucking floored

1853
06:22:53,500 --> 06:22:57,340
GTA 4 maybe a little bit more because that was the first time where it was like a new engine

1854
06:22:57,979 --> 06:23:01,770
It's been about 10 years

1855
06:23:01,770 --> 06:23:10,729
Fingers still gone check the remembrances. Yeah, I will

1856
06:23:12,700 --> 06:23:15,069
Yeah, I got to look at

1857
06:23:15,069 --> 06:23:17,950
Yeah, and of course, okay look for all my frustrations with this game

1858
06:23:18,590 --> 06:23:22,270
For all the times you heard me say like this sucks. It's dog shit. It's coke

1859
06:23:23,069 --> 06:23:27,869
This truly is one of the best games that's ever been made. I think everybody can agree on that even if you don't like it

1860
06:23:29,290 --> 06:23:33,290
This is without a single doubt in my mind will will go down

1861
06:23:34,590 --> 06:23:38,430
As one of the single greatest pieces of playable media ever

1862
06:23:39,639 --> 06:23:43,229
I really do feel that way

1863
06:23:43,310 --> 06:23:53,979
Let me show you something about god of war god of war

1864
06:23:55,159 --> 06:23:58,270
I yeah

1865
06:23:58,270 --> 06:24:00,270
When I walked out here for the first time

1866
06:24:01,560 --> 06:24:03,560
And knew that I had no directions

1867
06:24:04,599 --> 06:24:08,090
And I saw this

1868
06:24:08,090 --> 06:24:09,689
It was a feeling

1869
06:24:09,689 --> 06:24:14,409
That was just like right here that I haven't felt since I was like fucking probably 20 like 19

1870
06:24:16,080 --> 06:24:20,240
That's how I gauge whether or not a game is like like holy shit. This is crazy

1871
06:24:21,720 --> 06:24:22,840
uh

1872
06:24:22,840 --> 06:24:27,560
Walking down here and realizing like how much is here going even to these first this first like kind of shack

1873
06:24:28,360 --> 06:24:30,599
Realizing that you can find things on the map

1874
06:24:31,799 --> 06:24:33,930
find little dungeons

1875
06:24:34,009 --> 06:24:38,090
It's terrifying it is an overwhelming horrifying experience

1876
06:24:41,979 --> 06:24:45,099
Nothing has done that since probably I don't know maybe like

1877
06:24:46,250 --> 06:24:51,400
eat the engineer video

1878
06:24:51,400 --> 06:24:53,400
Game is very front-loaded. I will

1879
06:24:57,900 --> 06:25:03,159
I will say the this the game is very front-loaded. I think that this area here

1880
06:25:04,459 --> 06:25:06,750
leading into k-lid

1881
06:25:06,750 --> 06:25:11,900
and then a little bit probably I but hold on I did love um, I did really like the

1882
06:25:12,459 --> 06:25:14,889
kind of capital area

1883
06:25:14,889 --> 06:25:19,419
Elmer was really cool, too

1884
06:25:19,419 --> 06:25:22,540
I I can't say that this was particularly like incredible

1885
06:25:23,259 --> 06:25:25,259
It's kind of just snow and fog

1886
06:25:26,650 --> 06:25:27,610
but

1887
06:25:27,610 --> 06:25:28,810
I don't think

1888
06:25:28,810 --> 06:25:30,810
This first like 10 to 20 hours of the game

1889
06:25:31,290 --> 06:25:33,659
Maybe even the first 30 to 40 hours

1890
06:25:34,330 --> 06:25:37,369
And ray lucaria was crazy too like walking in these front doors

1891
06:25:38,169 --> 06:25:45,869
And making dlc as well. Yeah

1892
06:25:45,869 --> 06:25:49,950
Like when you do this, I did it on stream. You saw how I reacted to it

1893
06:25:52,090 --> 06:25:53,869
You go through here

1894
06:25:53,869 --> 06:25:55,869
And you get to see the ray lucaria building

1895
06:25:57,439 --> 06:25:59,720
Yeah, azula was yeah

1896
06:25:59,720 --> 06:26:02,119
There's way more good zones than bad zones. Let's put it that way

1897
06:26:02,680 --> 06:26:07,580
The game does fall off a little bit at the end. I I have to admit that

1898
06:26:09,529 --> 06:26:12,729
Kind of feels like they just throw a bunch of shit at you in the last like 10 hours

1899
06:26:14,799 --> 06:26:16,799
Like seeing this in the distance

1900
06:26:16,880 --> 06:26:19,680
Seeing like azula in the distance being here seeing the ur trees

1901
06:26:24,330 --> 06:26:26,409
But the first 40 hours of this game

1902
06:26:27,209 --> 06:26:31,119
Makes up for the last five to ten hours a hundred times over

1903
06:26:31,680 --> 06:26:40,279
Is the

1904
06:26:40,279 --> 06:26:51,419
Where's the it's is it right here? Where's the the we can see the building the end bosses ain't aren't bad though

1905
06:26:52,380 --> 06:26:55,180
I just I feel like the last couple bosses just felt like just very

1906
06:26:55,799 --> 06:27:00,029
spammy and annoying

1907
06:27:00,029 --> 06:27:03,259
And you know what? Here's a complaint

1908
06:27:04,619 --> 06:27:06,619
We have this really cool horse

1909
06:27:07,259 --> 06:27:09,259
We don't get like a final like epic

1910
06:27:09,819 --> 06:27:15,259
Battle where we can use the horse in that last area against the elden beast. That would be cool

1911
06:27:17,549 --> 06:27:21,150
Like torrent's been with us the whole game and we don't get to kind of have that ending with horn

1912
06:27:21,950 --> 06:27:24,750
I feel like that's that's a big ball drop

1913
06:27:25,840 --> 06:27:27,840
Especially because the boss moves around so much

1914
06:27:31,959 --> 06:27:38,759
I wanted to take torrent to the end but torrent really kind of felt like a real afterthought in the last like 10 hours or so

1915
06:27:39,560 --> 06:27:42,939
The fire giant was the last time that I really think thought I really needed to use it

1916
06:27:46,779 --> 06:27:51,959
But that's not why that's why I don't think it's 10. I think it's like one of the best games ever made

1917
06:27:52,119 --> 06:27:54,680
I think it's like a nine seven nine eight nine nine, maybe

1918
06:27:55,319 --> 06:27:57,319
Who gives a shit about scores? That's stupid. Anyways

1919
06:27:58,439 --> 06:28:02,360
Who cares about like me have I got to give you like a score. No, this is one of the best games ever made

1920
06:28:02,360 --> 06:28:04,159
That's all you need to know

1921
06:28:04,159 --> 06:28:08,319
Stamp it recommended best game one of the best games of all time. That's it. That's all I need to know

1922
06:28:08,400 --> 06:28:11,759
Who cares about like an arbitrary? Well nine point seven eight like

1923
06:28:12,720 --> 06:28:14,560
Why am I even having that number?

1924
06:28:14,560 --> 06:28:23,740
I'm making that number up that number makes no sense. I'm going to the same place

1925
06:28:32,360 --> 06:28:37,319
Better than bloodborne. Yeah, it is but just because it's just a newer game newer technology not on a playstation 4

1926
06:28:38,200 --> 06:28:49,340
And you know, it's kind of depressing in a way, you know that post

1927
06:28:50,220 --> 06:28:53,979
Uh best masterpiece game ever made kind of depression here

1928
06:28:55,419 --> 06:28:58,619
I'm like sad the game is over. That's why I haven't gone to bed yet

1929
06:28:59,259 --> 06:29:02,889
Yeah, like look at this like this is just this was so awe-inspiring

1930
06:29:03,450 --> 06:29:07,549
It's like this will be explained really well

1931
06:29:09,580 --> 06:29:11,580
What the fuck is in there?

1932
06:29:13,759 --> 06:29:15,200
You don't know

1933
06:29:15,200 --> 06:29:18,639
You know, it's gonna be really you're gonna be you're probably gonna be in that room somehow

1934
06:29:19,360 --> 06:29:23,680
You're gonna be all over this place i'm seeing it at a macro kind of scale

1935
06:29:25,040 --> 06:29:27,279
It hits you in this weird way where you just don't

1936
06:29:28,240 --> 06:29:32,639
You're so confused. You're so terrified of this thing. You're so awe inspired

1937
06:29:34,279 --> 06:29:36,759
You know, you're gonna walk around every room in this place

1938
06:29:38,169 --> 06:29:40,169
And you know, it's gonna be hard and you know, it's gonna be scary

1939
06:29:40,490 --> 06:29:44,700
But like let's fucking go

1940
06:29:44,700 --> 06:29:46,939
Is this the honeymoon period or do you actually really like it?

1941
06:29:48,029 --> 06:29:52,909
I mean, it's been almost like 40 days. I don't think there's much more time for a honeymoon phase

1942
06:29:53,630 --> 06:30:02,430
Yeah

1943
06:30:02,430 --> 06:30:05,790
A lot of places like in the game did that especially in limb grave, especially here

1944
06:30:06,509 --> 06:30:14,909
There's a fake wall in there

1945
06:30:14,909 --> 06:30:16,909
And let me find let me find my favorite spot

1946
06:30:17,610 --> 06:30:18,569
but

1947
06:30:18,569 --> 06:30:21,529
I'll I know i'm kind of stalling to end the stream here, but still

1948
06:30:23,479 --> 06:30:28,669
um, I know i'm stalling but

1949
06:30:29,500 --> 06:30:32,240
having that area

1950
06:30:32,240 --> 06:30:39,849
Where you can see this? Let me see if I can find it here. It's from a cliff

1951
06:30:40,490 --> 06:30:43,290
And it's just you can't even believe that you can see it

1952
06:30:43,930 --> 06:30:49,799
Where is it? It's kind of far away. Maybe here

1953
06:30:50,520 --> 06:30:58,270
Is one spot where you can see the lacaria and a couple other things

1954
06:31:01,740 --> 06:31:03,900
North of stormville. Okay. Yeah, I know it's like up here somewhere

1955
06:31:05,479 --> 06:31:12,680
This is it right here. Yeah, I mean the stream's over but I mean we're just hanging out

1956
06:31:18,299 --> 06:31:24,119
Yeah, this is it here. It's just

1957
06:31:25,580 --> 06:31:28,220
You know, all right, you just saw it up close

1958
06:31:29,770 --> 06:31:31,290
from far away

1959
06:31:31,290 --> 06:31:33,209
it seems

1960
06:31:33,209 --> 06:31:36,409
The journey seems so awesome from here to there

1961
06:31:38,279 --> 06:31:42,279
Mount gallimard is right there. You got one of the churches you got ready. Look harry a lot of the it

1962
06:31:43,000 --> 06:31:47,150
It's just I love it. It's sad that it's over

1963
06:31:48,990 --> 06:31:50,430
But that's what means

1964
06:31:50,430 --> 06:31:51,869
I'm about to r1

1965
06:31:51,869 --> 06:31:55,580
Hello, there's someone there. My name is hietta

1966
06:31:56,729 --> 06:31:58,889
And i'm journeying in search of the distant light

1967
06:31:59,450 --> 06:32:01,450
I wish the ruins weren't so repetitive

1968
06:32:02,490 --> 06:32:04,490
Some of those done. All right

1969
06:32:05,049 --> 06:32:10,009
If we're gonna okay you just heard me gush about the game some of those dungeons were dogs of shit

1970
06:32:10,569 --> 06:32:15,549
Some of those dungeons were just awful. It's truly terrible just complete afterthoughts

1971
06:32:17,770 --> 06:32:19,770
It was

1972
06:32:20,330 --> 06:32:23,369
I want to say maybe five to maybe like 10 of them were pretty awful

1973
06:32:26,360 --> 06:32:28,759
But that's not that there's so much in the game though

1974
06:32:29,240 --> 06:32:33,959
It's so easy for me to sit here and not for us to be like that was fucking stupid. Those dungeons were terrible

1975
06:32:36,299 --> 06:32:39,740
but I mean like

1976
06:32:39,740 --> 06:32:44,639
Look at all this

1977
06:32:44,639 --> 06:32:49,259
You don't have to do them

1978
06:32:49,259 --> 06:32:54,380
That's why it's not a perfect game, but it's pretty damn fucking close and I know i've been swearing a lot

1979
06:32:54,380 --> 06:32:56,139
But I just i'm exhausted

1980
06:32:56,139 --> 06:32:59,419
There's a bunch of disappointing triple a releases. It's pretty great

1981
06:33:01,049 --> 06:33:05,450
Yeah, that too that too. Let's be let's let's get no let's talk no more criticism

1982
06:33:07,369 --> 06:33:09,930
I think this

1983
06:33:09,930 --> 06:33:11,639
shows

1984
06:33:11,639 --> 06:33:15,159
That you can still make incredible experiences that people

1985
06:33:17,580 --> 06:33:19,740
That people will the jaw will hit the floor still

1986
06:33:20,299 --> 06:33:24,540
I know a god of war it was an I told you the first like two or three hours of god of war

1987
06:33:24,540 --> 06:33:26,540
I thought were fucking unbelievable

1988
06:33:26,860 --> 06:33:27,659
um

1989
06:33:27,659 --> 06:33:32,040
I feel like that game dropped off for me a little bit though. But again that first like hour

1990
06:33:32,840 --> 06:33:35,400
God of war especially that first major fight

1991
06:33:36,119 --> 06:33:40,279
Was like it did the same thing it hit me in the same place. I was like, holy shit. This is cool

1992
06:33:42,200 --> 06:33:46,439
Uh, it's still it's still here and anybody that tells you that like oh gaming is fucking dead

1993
06:33:47,080 --> 06:33:51,720
Every all games suck. It's fucking awful what the industry is in this in the shitter right now

1994
06:33:51,799 --> 06:33:53,639
It's like I mean this look at this

1995
06:33:53,639 --> 06:33:59,720
this exists

1996
06:33:59,720 --> 06:34:00,889
um

1997
06:34:00,889 --> 06:34:02,889
And my god what a journey it was

1998
06:34:03,529 --> 06:34:08,000
What are we at for time?

1999
06:34:08,080 --> 06:34:10,959
105 well, let's say 104 104 hours

2000
06:34:15,049 --> 06:34:18,090
I've i've never put 100 hours into a single campaign ever

2001
06:34:18,889 --> 06:34:20,889
I don't think that's that's never happened

2002
06:34:21,209 --> 06:34:24,830
I have to be real

2003
06:34:24,830 --> 06:34:26,110
that has

2004
06:34:26,110 --> 06:34:28,279
Never happened my whole life

2005
06:34:28,279 --> 06:34:33,159
Never

2006
06:34:33,159 --> 06:34:36,759
I played through bloodborne a bunch of times, but all those playthroughs were like 40 hours

2007
06:34:37,240 --> 06:34:42,200
40 to 50 hours dark souls 3 was like 50 hours, right 40 to 60 hours maybe

2008
06:34:47,279 --> 06:34:55,439
GTA 5 would probably come close somewhere around probably like 70 or 80 not 100 one more for the road

2009
06:35:01,229 --> 06:35:07,520
How many times did I die in total what's the total death count

2010
06:35:16,790 --> 06:35:20,060
736 times

2011
06:35:20,080 --> 06:35:25,069
Oh my god

2012
06:35:25,610 --> 06:35:27,840
736

2013
06:35:27,840 --> 06:35:31,759
But yeah, all right. Let me tell you my plans for the future of this game because i'm not done with it

2014
06:35:32,400 --> 06:35:37,470
Because i'm sad and I don't want it to end so it's not going to

2015
06:35:38,400 --> 06:35:40,240
We are going to do

2016
06:35:40,240 --> 06:35:43,130
a like community night

2017
06:35:43,130 --> 06:35:47,689
I am going to you can summon me. We'll do i'll put my sign down without a password. We'll do summons

2018
06:35:48,490 --> 06:35:50,490
You guys are having trouble with something. Maybe I can come help

2019
06:35:51,639 --> 06:35:55,080
Me strong needs to do his first like 10 hours first five hours

2020
06:35:56,119 --> 06:35:57,880
Maybe first two hours

2021
06:35:57,880 --> 06:36:01,639
I want to do like a pvp like invasion night. At least maybe we'll come down the whole thing

2022
06:36:06,159 --> 06:36:08,000
So it's not over

2023
06:36:08,000 --> 06:36:12,080
But it's not going to be a priority anymore considering. I just beat it

2024
06:36:15,479 --> 06:36:17,869
Elden ring

2025
06:36:17,869 --> 06:36:19,869
Is now it's not going to be every single stream

2026
06:36:22,000 --> 06:36:23,360
It will be

2027
06:36:23,360 --> 06:36:29,500
In once in a while, maybe maybe the next stream will probably be something else. We'll probably move to some. Uh, well, we'll see

2028
06:36:31,560 --> 06:36:33,560
But it's not a priority anymore

2029
06:36:33,720 --> 06:36:40,400
And that's the end of the stream. Thanks for staying up late

2030
06:36:41,040 --> 06:36:46,680
Thanks for putting up with my anger and my bullshit. I really appreciate it as always of course

2031
06:36:47,639 --> 06:36:51,040
Wrong thing. That was an incredible journey

2032
06:36:51,840 --> 06:36:53,840
Game is unbelievably good

2033
06:36:54,909 --> 06:36:58,029
And I am incredibly happy to have shared it with you

2034
06:36:58,669 --> 06:37:02,200
Let's just be real

2035
06:37:02,200 --> 06:37:04,200
That was uh, uh, really fun

2036
06:37:05,290 --> 06:37:07,369
I'll be uh, let's be let me be really honest

2037
06:37:07,930 --> 06:37:12,169
That was some of the most fun just kind of playing a video game and hanging out with you guys i've had in a long time

2038
06:37:12,889 --> 06:37:30,040
Dad to see it go. I didn't even look at the remembrances. It's true. That was amazing

2039
06:37:37,099 --> 06:37:38,779
so, uh

2040
06:37:38,779 --> 06:37:43,500
See, uh, see another 10 years when another like fucking masterpiece comes out. God damn it

2041
06:37:46,270 --> 06:37:48,110
America's hammer

2042
06:37:48,110 --> 06:37:53,099
Stone hammer made in the lands of the newman

2043
06:37:53,740 --> 06:37:55,580
outside the lands between

2044
06:37:55,580 --> 06:37:59,819
The tool with which queen marika shattered the elden ring and radigan attempted to repair it

2045
06:38:04,139 --> 06:38:09,880
Wait, the hammer partially broke upon shattering the ring becoming splintered with ruined fragments

2046
06:38:10,360 --> 06:38:15,159
This is not a masterpiece

2047
06:38:15,240 --> 06:38:18,009
I think it is

2048
06:38:18,009 --> 06:38:19,209
I think it is

2049
06:38:19,209 --> 06:38:23,819
We can have different opinions. That's all right

2050
06:38:23,979 --> 06:38:27,389
I don't think it's perfect, but I do think it's a masterpiece

2051
06:38:31,479 --> 06:38:35,130
sacred relic sword

2052
06:38:35,130 --> 06:38:36,490
Thoughts on what the weapon

2053
06:38:36,490 --> 06:38:41,770
Or tens are many and varied some consider it the mark of a great sin or a sign of great devastation

2054
06:38:42,250 --> 06:38:45,049
Some think it is at the end of an age while others the beginning

2055
06:38:45,770 --> 06:38:52,490
Can view the sword with bygone golden glory then fire at foes a wide golden wave fans out sweeping through all enemies caught in its path

2056
06:38:55,360 --> 06:38:58,639
Another faith dex faith. It's the farming sword

2057
06:38:59,439 --> 06:39:07,119
There's masterpieces you haven't played yet

2058
06:39:10,860 --> 06:39:12,860
I okay, let's announce it

2059
06:39:13,849 --> 06:39:17,119
I'll play breath of the wild

2060
06:39:17,119 --> 06:39:22,040
I will not immediately but we'll cue it up

2061
06:39:23,240 --> 06:39:25,240
I will cue up breath of the wild and we'll play it

2062
06:39:34,279 --> 06:39:37,880
You can't play breath of the wild after this. I'm not gonna we're gonna wait a little bit

2063
06:39:38,759 --> 06:39:40,759
I'm not gonna just like oh, hey guys, uh

2064
06:39:41,639 --> 06:39:48,750
Wednesday stream is breath of the wild now. I'll give it some time. This is really cool though

2065
06:39:49,310 --> 06:39:53,759
I'm not gonna do any of that right now

2066
06:39:53,759 --> 06:39:54,799
All right

2067
06:39:54,799 --> 06:39:56,319
enough stalling

2068
06:39:56,319 --> 06:39:58,430
Thanks for staying up with me

2069
06:39:58,430 --> 06:40:01,819
Uh, that was a wild one. I feel like I fucking

2070
06:40:02,540 --> 06:40:04,220
Had a meltdown

2071
06:40:04,220 --> 06:40:08,939
Accepted the meltdown had another meltdown and then had an end to the stream. That was like three meltdowns in a row

2072
06:40:09,580 --> 06:40:14,700
Wasn't I like when they're like a black and white like i'm smoking on camera routine

2073
06:40:15,500 --> 06:40:20,220
I don't remember any of that

2074
06:40:20,220 --> 06:40:23,900
Almost accidental cock reveal. That's right. What a fucked up stream

2075
06:40:26,159 --> 06:40:29,759
I oh i'm okay. I almost showed my dick on stream

2076
06:40:32,639 --> 06:40:35,119
Let's just be let's call it what it was

2077
06:40:35,119 --> 06:40:37,119
That's unbelievably that's awful

2078
06:40:38,000 --> 06:40:40,000
I'm fucking wearing jeans from now on every stream

2079
06:40:43,599 --> 06:40:46,639
That's fucked up

2080
06:40:46,639 --> 06:40:48,639
No, i'm kidding. It didn't

2081
06:40:48,880 --> 06:40:52,639
I have pants on I have undergarments on i'm kidding

2082
06:40:53,930 --> 06:40:55,930
But like my fly is open

2083
06:40:55,930 --> 06:41:04,880
Just wear I have pants on I was kidding camera got barely below your chest. Yeah, but I didn't know that

2084
06:41:07,209 --> 06:41:11,930
I love it. People just like what is he talking about? What is what the fuck are you talking about?

2085
06:41:13,310 --> 06:41:14,750
Wait

2086
06:41:14,750 --> 06:41:18,889
Is hugh still here?

2087
06:41:18,889 --> 06:41:22,990
I didn't even check

2088
06:41:22,990 --> 06:41:42,200
They're still here. I don't feel too bad about this being over. There are many masterpieces. You never played from the last 30 years

2089
06:41:42,919 --> 06:41:45,799
Yeah, that's true. That's a that's a good way to think about it. It is

2090
06:41:49,319 --> 06:41:52,759
But i'm sad to have like because you know, it's that everybody's into it

2091
06:41:52,840 --> 06:41:54,840
Everybody's trying to piece together the lore and

2092
06:41:55,630 --> 06:41:56,909
everybody's

2093
06:41:56,909 --> 06:41:59,229
So happy about it. I don't know. It just feels cool

2094
06:42:00,599 --> 06:42:03,880
big giant gaming community events like this are always awesome

2095
06:42:04,759 --> 06:42:08,439
seeing like all the gifts and all the people funny ways they've died all the

2096
06:42:09,529 --> 06:42:11,529
Funny stories people have people can tell

2097
06:42:12,090 --> 06:42:16,000
Doesn't happen that often once every like three or four years we get something like this

2098
06:42:21,709 --> 06:42:23,470
So the next stream

2099
06:42:23,470 --> 06:42:29,020
Let's take a look at a calendar here because it's not gonna be tomorrow or today. Whatever

2100
06:42:31,520 --> 06:42:33,360
Um, let's go

2101
06:42:33,360 --> 06:42:36,080
Let's go for tuesday

2102
06:42:36,080 --> 06:42:40,860
tuesday the 5th

2103
06:42:40,860 --> 06:42:46,169
What's your favorite boss?

2104
06:42:46,169 --> 06:42:47,610
uh horror lu

2105
06:42:47,610 --> 06:42:50,009
Let me think

2106
06:42:50,009 --> 06:42:53,049
Uh horror lu slash godfrey is probably my favorite of the whole game

2107
06:42:53,689 --> 06:42:57,080
I could do a tier list eventually here

2108
06:42:57,979 --> 06:43:01,340
total play time 105 hours and 47 minutes

2109
06:43:09,209 --> 06:43:11,209
I think the big centipede

2110
06:43:11,770 --> 06:43:12,650
what

2111
06:43:12,650 --> 06:43:16,919
the void big centipede void thing was really just

2112
06:43:17,540 --> 06:43:19,540
terrifying and awe inspiring

2113
06:43:19,619 --> 06:43:22,020
Probably that one was pretty high astell. Yeah

2114
06:43:24,650 --> 06:43:26,810
rykard was cool, but rykard was kind of a gimmick though

2115
06:43:27,529 --> 06:43:30,599
It was a fun gimmick, but it was still kind of a gimmick

2116
06:43:33,080 --> 06:43:35,080
If I had a top three it'd be horror lu

2117
06:43:35,479 --> 06:43:38,470
astell

2118
06:43:38,470 --> 06:43:42,919
and

2119
06:43:42,919 --> 06:43:44,520
Maybe godric

2120
06:43:44,520 --> 06:43:46,520
Even though I talked a lot of shit

2121
06:43:47,080 --> 06:43:48,919
the music for godric

2122
06:43:48,919 --> 06:43:52,599
It was awesome. The scene where he takes the dragon was really cool

2123
06:43:56,389 --> 06:44:02,360
Mogg was cool

2124
06:44:02,360 --> 06:44:04,200
Favorite non-boss

2125
06:44:04,200 --> 06:44:08,439
Oh, that's right placida placida sax was pretty cool as well. That's right

2126
06:44:10,700 --> 06:44:13,509
Yeah, I would put that in the top five

2127
06:44:13,509 --> 06:44:15,270
It'd be mariner. Yeah

2128
06:44:15,270 --> 06:44:17,740
What about the baseball stream?

2129
06:44:17,740 --> 06:44:22,700
I don't have any updates for you for the baseball stream. I do have a very vague update for you

2130
06:44:23,740 --> 06:44:26,169
That it's going to happen

2131
06:44:27,639 --> 06:44:29,900
probably in

2132
06:44:29,900 --> 06:44:32,939
july

2133
06:44:32,939 --> 06:44:34,939
Couldn't get it done in time

2134
06:44:36,020 --> 06:44:39,619
Uh, so july i'm gonna have a hard date for you probably in the next few weeks

2135
06:44:41,500 --> 06:44:43,080
Um

2136
06:44:43,080 --> 06:44:45,770
Look for a hard date. You'll get it soon

2137
06:44:48,200 --> 06:44:55,560
It'll be in the summer

2138
06:44:55,560 --> 06:44:58,279
It's gonna know it is gonna happen. That's gonna be one of my favorite streams ever

2139
06:45:03,000 --> 06:45:05,000
any updates on grotto beast

2140
06:45:05,080 --> 06:45:07,080
grotto beast is another one of those things that I

2141
06:45:07,560 --> 06:45:10,119
Need to put a lot more of my brain power into

2142
06:45:12,419 --> 06:45:16,180
My brain has been very focused on like one thing the last month

2143
06:45:17,430 --> 06:45:19,909
um

2144
06:45:19,909 --> 06:45:21,990
But yeah, it's also that is still a thing

2145
06:45:26,299 --> 06:45:28,500
Um

2146
06:45:28,500 --> 06:45:33,220
All things ceased to exist while elden ring was a thing. I was kind of afraid of that but

2147
06:45:33,939 --> 06:45:41,180
How many more stream events are we going to have this year?

2148
06:45:42,229 --> 06:45:44,659
I would say at least two

2149
06:45:44,659 --> 06:45:51,240
Baseball is guaranteed and then there might be one more. There might be one more big one. It might be very big

2150
06:45:51,799 --> 06:45:59,930
Good night, everybody

2151
06:45:59,930 --> 06:46:01,930
See you again on tuesday

2152
06:46:03,799 --> 06:46:05,240
4 pm

2153
06:46:05,240 --> 06:46:06,360
pacific

2154
06:46:06,360 --> 06:46:09,939
Take care of yourselves

2155
06:46:09,939 --> 06:46:15,080
Those of you that have been here for the entirety of elden ring

2156
06:46:15,799 --> 06:46:19,450
Thanks for sticking around and uh and going on the journey with me

2157
06:46:20,250 --> 06:46:25,020
Did it before but i'll say it again. Have a great night. I'll see you tuesday
