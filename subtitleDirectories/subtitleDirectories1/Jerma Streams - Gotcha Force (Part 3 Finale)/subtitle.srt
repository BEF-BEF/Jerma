1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:09,960
Mount Fiji. Mount Fiji. Yeah, yeah. Whatever, Mount Fuji. It's fine.

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,250
Somebody asked me what my favorite mountain was in the pre-stream chat and I said Mount

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:24,300
Fiji because I like Fiji water. And I thought for three or four seconds that Mount Fiji,

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,920
Fiji was a Fiji mountain. That's where it came from. But that's not where it comes from.

5
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:38,939
Maybe it is. I don't know. The Fiji River? Fiji pond? I don't know. I thought it was Mount

6
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:42,219
Fiji for 10 seconds. And I was like, no, it's actually Mount Fuji. They're not different

7
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:55,509
things. Fiji is the place. The mountain is Fiji. Right. Fiji is a country. Okay. Well,

8
00:00:55,509 --> 00:01:00,500
is there a mountain in Fiji? Whatever it is, that's the one I like. That's my favorite mountain.

9
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:15,989
Anyways, probably there's exactly one mountain. Well, that's good. That's my favorite one.

10
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:32,599
Show us your mountain wallpaper. I don't have mountain wallpaper. Not anymore. It's been

11
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:39,349
changed. And you don't get to see it. That's for me only. But today we're going to finish

12
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:46,090
Gotcha Force. I have to sell all my toys today. I've got to give them away and sell them and get

13
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:54,549
rid of them. I got boxes of them. Mom's making me do this. She came into my room and said,

14
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:00,299
it's time for you to get rid of all these toys. They're everywhere. It's ridiculous.

15
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:08,069
Don't need to keep every toy from when you were 15. Just come on, get the f**king out of here,

16
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:14,300
Ma. I want to get rid of them. I'm 35. Whatever. I have like toys and s**t. I like them.

17
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:33,419
Leave me alone, Ma. Break. Toys from when you were 15. She doesn't understand. Voting to ban Mom.

18
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:39,500
Don't talk to your mother like that. I didn't. She left the room and I said, f**king what the f**k,

19
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:47,270
Ma? Shut up. The door was closed. She was gone. I went, yes, mother. The door closed and I went,

20
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:56,599
shut up. Stupid dumb Mom. We're going to finish Gotcha Force though. I feel like we can get this

21
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:09,610
done. Very fun game. We're going to see the end. Hopefully. Vito, please. All right, I'll get to it.

22
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:16,569
I'm going to, I'm getting to it. You want to see Vito so bad. He's going to be on the screen in

23
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:23,939
about five seconds. Camera's not on. There he is. Be hurry, Vito, Vito. There, there is Vito.

24
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:29,210
It's the name of the character. I'm so glad that you wanted to see him so badly.

25
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,469
There's a lot of enthusiasm here. I'm seeing Vito in all capitals.

26
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:43,240
Holy s**t. You guys really want to see him. All right. Give the people what they want.

27
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:51,580
Anyways, let's go. Welcome back. I'm going to finish this today and then tomorrow we're going

28
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:59,689
to play Patapon, which by the way, I actually looked into Patapon and it was a PSP game. Oh,

29
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:03,610
wow. Patapon. It's cool. It's such a good game. You should play it. I thought this was like a two

30
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:18,360
to three hour experience. Patapon is like a 20 hour game. How, how is Patapon as long as like

31
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:33,800
The Witcher 2. Don't worry about it. Oh, he doesn't know. I'm pogging in real life so much right now.

32
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:40,899
Yeah. Well, I'm going to try it. See if I play the whole thing. Witcher started at three. Don't,

33
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:47,300
they don't make games like they used to. All right, let's get going. We have our team. If

34
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:56,069
you don't know what gacha force is, you're in for a huge pog moment. Actually, let's do this one.

35
00:04:56,069 --> 00:05:05,899
This one, this one's like dark. Fight in the air battle. All right. Air battle, huh? Well,

36
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:11,579
this ain't going to work. You want to see your beautiful face? We cannot. Oh, look at this mess.

37
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:18,920
It's a mess. I have to get rid of them. I have to start to, I'm not going to use some of these.

38
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,329
All right. It's an air battle. So we need air. Just give, I gotta get rid of them all.

39
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:38,629
Just delete the force. Okay. What? Why are you all the way over here? All right. Wind Valkyrie

40
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:47,639
and then ice Valkyrie. Where's the airplane? Air, actually airplanes first. It's an air battle. For

41
00:05:47,639 --> 00:06:03,319
God's sake, then bring Valkyrie, a sniper girl, battery man. No, maybe revolver gunman. Just to

42
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:19,259
like take people off. What should I use? Do all the tornado Valkyrie. I still got money and

43
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:27,300
soldier and one more. I can do the ninja. It's always in the way. I went to level two, a ninja.

44
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:37,850
There we go. All right, let's do the air battle. Giant sword, ghost samurai. Um, we'll see. This

45
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:45,060
might have been a dumb idea. We'll find out. Jump King waiting. I deleted my save. It's not

46
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:51,910
going to, I'll never open that game ever again. Like that's a fact. I, I ain't ever opening that

47
00:06:51,910 --> 00:07:12,970
game again. Why would I do that at this point? I deleted my save. Download a new save. I'm not

48
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:18,089
going to download a new save. I've, why do I, I've, the only reason why I opened it is because I had

49
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:36,810
like four drinks at that point. Ooh, sorry. Get up in the air. It was four whole drinks.

50
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:43,259
Yeah. I didn't, I didn't, I didn't just tell you that I, I couldn't walk. I just said I had some

51
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:48,870
drinks and it was like, ah yeah, let's play Jump King. That's funny. And then I deleted the save

52
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:53,160
accidentally. All right, this is not going to work out. They're not fast enough. They're not even

53
00:07:53,160 --> 00:08:04,180
remotely fast enough for this. It was five at that point. Well, whatever. Yeah, they're not fast enough.

54
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:18,149
I'm just being outpaced completely. This ain't going to happen. The only, you know how this

55
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:35,460
happens with this character only. That's going to fly into people and got it. Okay. Same deal.

56
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:43,590
Again, any other game waiting room? Well, I'll see you tomorrow. That's how long you're going

57
00:08:43,590 --> 00:09:07,139
to have to wait. See you tomorrow. This character is actually really good. Atapog. I'm looking, I

58
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:22,090
look, people have told me to play that for like a year. I'm looking forward to it. So it's an RPG.

59
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:34,100
I thought it was a rhythm game. It is a rhythm game. It's both.

60
00:09:35,429 --> 00:09:46,970
Really? Is it like a story? Yes. Is it a good story or is it a story that's in the background

61
00:09:46,970 --> 00:10:03,429
because it had to be there? Give me the truth. It's good. Okay. Okay. It has nudity. Don't stream it.

62
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:09,159
I think I'll be all right. I don't think that's going to be a problem. By the way, I got my ass

63
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:16,950
kicked. Is this the last person? No, no, no. I got one more wing person. Oh, you're that high in the

64
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:36,169
air. I got to get in close. Kill. Quit. Okay. Only two or three more. This is it, I think.

65
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:45,659
Should be it. I didn't knock that off. How? All right. This is my last person. I got to,

66
00:10:45,659 --> 00:11:03,610
okay, here we go. Let's see if the spam can help me here. Die. Yes. Yes. When's it going to have a

67
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:09,129
meltdown? Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Oh shit. That actually, hey, what was it? What was it? What was

68
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:13,129
it? What was it? What was it? What happens every time? What happens every time? What happens every

69
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:23,059
time? What was it? What was it? Come on. What just fell and like crashed down here? Yes. We

70
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:32,389
sensor bar. It happens every time. It's sitting on top of my monitor. And if I move my desk even

71
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:37,590
like a little bit, it just falls and crashes down. And it's, dude, it's crazy when that happens.

72
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:47,210
It's like, it weighs like less than like 12 ounces. It goes like crash. It's crazy. It's

73
00:11:47,210 --> 00:12:03,620
worth reacting that harshly over. Oh, I got another plane. The crashes and I go, what the fuck?

74
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:11,000
Even though the thing weighs less than a 10th of a pound. He's just overreacting for the camera at

75
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:31,799
this point. Asshole. Wait a minute. What? I got one. Gatling gunner. Ooh. All right. I thought the

76
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:44,899
game crashed for a second. I was like, okay, he's going to keep going. Violet attacker.

77
00:12:48,980 --> 00:13:07,100
Oh, funny Gatling go brr. Oh, all right. Let's make an actual team now. Let's see. Long range

78
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:17,049
and grenade and then Gatling gun. The gadget booker was in the military. This great man with a

79
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:24,409
pivoted jaw sweeps away the bad guys with deadly fire from his special Gatling. What was a pivoted

80
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:37,179
jaw? I feel like his jaw goes sideways at that point. Pivoting jaw? What does that mean?

81
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:54,379
Uh, this is the fastest one, I guess. Vulcan power beam and napalm bomb. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

82
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:58,629
It's a plane. That's all you need to know. Who cares? This one on the other hand, this is

83
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:05,340
different. This thing's got a bomb. Both power bomb. Fighters have got your book who was created

84
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:11,590
during the interplanetary mega board war. He can attack the ground with bombs. All right.

85
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:17,110
I'll try it. Let's, let's use the planes. Are these just the exact same things have different

86
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:28,539
colors? Yeah, they are. But they're still good. This thing's level three. And now with the Gatling

87
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:34,379
gunner. I want to try, I want to try you first actually. I feel like I'm really going to like

88
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:46,149
this character. All right. 420 though. That's a lot. Who else can I put in here? Exclamation point.

89
00:14:46,149 --> 00:15:03,379
Up dog. What the? Dude. Uh, I can't use you. That's, that's good. I'll give it a try. Um,

90
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:11,940
man is home. A big cockroach parade. Please help me Vito. There are lots of death force

91
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:23,029
boards that look like roaches. Let's go. Ever played custom robo behind me? We'll play that

92
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:27,350
eventually. I want to play this first because I remember playing this game when I was just a

93
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:39,850
child. Holy shit. This is awesome. Oh my God. It has so many, wait, what, what does the grenade do?

94
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:49,220
There's a very little bomb. That's cool. Long reload, but he can't move when he shoots. It's

95
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:59,379
to stand still. So it's hard to, how many are there? I guess I can jump and move and do it

96
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:03,139
like that. But I can't, I have to stand still. Feel pretty good. Probably for like those big

97
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:22,740
planes would be good. This is what this whole mission is. Killing the cockroaches. Do we get

98
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:39,100
any bigger cockroaches? When's the next Brownie rant? Oh, let me tell you. Brownie rant waiting

99
00:16:39,100 --> 00:17:00,019
room. What the fuck is that? I don't, what do I need to know what you mean by that?

100
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:14,329
In before. Tell me you guys just, I swear there's just AI characters in here that have been

101
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:20,410
programmed to just write something strange every day. Just, I, you know, let's just program my

102
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:27,059
fucking weird bot. Just write weird shit every day. What am I going to write today? What's

103
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:33,779
a bot going to just pull from the random? How about in before bigger cock? That makes sense.

104
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:47,450
Gosh, of course though. This is interesting. What is this? Monsters? Bugs? Oh, wow. I don't care

105
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:54,059
about this at all. Hopefully. Hey, did he read it? I want to see if he reads this. He did. He

106
00:17:54,059 --> 00:18:00,819
always does. He always does. So it's perfect. Tomorrow I'm just going to write, put a cheese

107
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:07,190
sandwich down my underwear. It took me two full hours to clean it up. Maybe I can probably read

108
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:23,509
that tomorrow. Weirdos get out. Weirdos get out. Oh, I don't think you want to say that. I think

109
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:31,859
that's like, Oh, that's, I would have to leave. You're getting rid of me. I don't think this

110
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:53,180
channel would collapse if that was the case. Wait, there's a person. No weirdo. Weird. Don't,

111
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:59,819
don't weirdos here at that point. It'd be like, all right, well, I'm, I think I'll be done at

112
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:07,029
that point. It'd be like, nah, I think that's good. I'd be streaming to my mother. It's the only one

113
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:39,289
that would be left. She's watching your streams right now. Oh, maybe I think I have the combination

114
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:51,450
of this. No, of course not. Of course not. Your mom heard you say the in before line,

115
00:19:52,089 --> 00:20:00,119
but that's all right. My mother knows this is a comedy stream. It's okay. It's just, it's a,

116
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:06,200
it's a comedy stream. You know, we talk about comedy, we do thought projects. She knows,

117
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:15,269
she's on, she knows it. This is supposed to be comedy. And sometimes we play games that Jeremy

118
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:41,049
likes. I mean, no, we don't. Sometimes we play video games that Jeremy wants to play. That happens

119
00:20:41,049 --> 00:21:04,900
to be the last few days. No, you have to play games that I like. Oh, no, is this the McDonald's

120
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:13,750
thing again? No, it's not the McDonald's thing again. You guys know how many video games exist?

121
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:23,880
To be able to play your favorite video game, I'd have to stream like 10,000 more times.

122
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,480
You know what I mean? Like everyone has a favorite video game. I can't play your

123
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:41,539
favorite video game. How does this bomb work? You just drop it? I can't tell where it's going.

124
00:21:41,539 --> 00:22:08,730
This thing's dead already. Benched. I was gonna say flying around. My favorite video game is called,

125
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:12,170
my favorite video game is, Jerma hits himself in the crotch with a hammer.

126
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:34,579
Yeah, I know the remake of that one wasn't very good. You know, just the original, you know,

127
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:37,859
they tried to bring it back and it's like, dude, you hit yourself in the crotch with a hammer and

128
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:42,019
like fucked up your shit. It's already been destroyed. Like you're going to try it again?

129
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,420
You can't, no, the remakes suck.

130
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:16,359
No, I missed. No, I didn't. Yeah, I did. This guy's tough. Yeah, they, these two are actually tough.

131
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:40,980
Kind of, okay, be quiet. Oh, you fucking dick. Come on. I got the advantage right here.

132
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:47,509
Oh, this is the perfect thing that could have happened. He's so far away and his movement is

133
00:23:47,509 --> 00:24:13,480
terrible. Wow. I can't believe that is that. What a spawn. Unbelievable. Liar gunner. I already have

134
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:26,460
one of these and I don't really like them. Okay. How, what do we got? Uh, uh, too many planes,

135
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:35,190
too many planes. I want to replace one of these planes. One of my, I want to try this again

136
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:40,470
because I feel like it didn't get a good representation of what it was. Try it again.

137
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:55,859
Let's have you go first. Just change the music. That's all we ask. Um, you want to turn the music

138
00:24:55,859 --> 00:25:17,619
off? No, no, no, no. Music's driving me insane. Oh no. Yes, please turn it off.

139
00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:27,349
You don't like that every single five minutes.

140
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:40,329
All right, let's drop the bomb. I get it. How big is the explosion?

141
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,730
It's all right. You got it. You really got to time it though. Let's see if I got it.

142
00:25:46,680 --> 00:26:09,319
Uh, kind of sucks actually. This is really bad. How am I supposed to hit anybody with this? All

143
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:31,130
right. I, that was a direct hit and it was awful. Bench. $250 for this. Let's see how many fucking

144
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:45,210
skins you bought in Fortnite. How many, how many Fortnite skins? How many, how many like

145
00:26:45,210 --> 00:27:02,630
counter-strike skins do you have? You get a knife yet? Nah, but fuck this guy for getting a GameCube

146
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:17,900
game. You have two hats. Has the hat market like crashed or are people, is people still buying

147
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:31,140
them? Are they still expensive? I could have emulated this for free and you could have,

148
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:38,230
you could have bought a knife at Walmart and then spray painted it green. Do we really have to have

149
00:27:38,230 --> 00:28:15,289
this conversation? What is value? Somebody kill me because I can't aim at, I just, I blow this,

150
00:28:15,289 --> 00:28:24,619
just get this, get this plane. I can't just, what would you do with a green painted knife?

151
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:32,180
I don't know. You would, you would put it in your closet and look at it from time to time.

152
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:40,140
Ah, yeah. That's the green one. Where's the red one? There it is. Look at it for a second.

153
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:57,019
What am I talking about? I'm talking about how spending $2,000 on a CSGO knife skin is the same

154
00:28:57,019 --> 00:29:05,960
thing as just buying a real knife in real life and putting crayons on it and having like your

155
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:29,930
friends come over and look at it. Funko puff. Yeah. So, so we, what, what's with the criticizing

156
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:38,329
of what use or I spend our dollars on? If I buy a thousand Funko puffs, who gives a shit?

157
00:29:38,329 --> 00:29:44,809
If you buy a $2,000 CSGO knife, who cares? If I get gotcha force, it's like my favorite game and

158
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:50,650
I want to collect it and it's $200 and what? What's the difference? There is no difference.

159
00:29:51,289 --> 00:30:06,900
What about somebody said collecting bongs? I don't know. It's your money. What are you going

160
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:18,490
to tell you? What? I think I have an opinion of you collecting bongs. Did you have the space for

161
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:22,009
this? Well, that's all. That's my only, here's my only question. Do you have the space for this?

162
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:26,890
Yeah, I got plenty of space. All right, then collect as many fucking bongs as you want.

163
00:30:27,769 --> 00:31:07,240
He's endorsing bong collection. I only smoke tobacco out of my bong with a happy face.

164
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:14,900
All right. Well, then you can use a tobacco bong as all this shit is the same.

165
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:21,589
When you go over somebody's house and they have like 25 bongs with like,

166
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:26,230
this one's got like Jimi Hendrix on it. This one's like green. It has lava lamps.

167
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,509
You do realize that you probably look at your like TF2 backpack.

168
00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:46,309
It's all the same shit. This is like intro. It's like collecting things and who cares?

169
00:31:47,029 --> 00:32:09,529
Is this consumerism? All right. I can tell you guys are bored. I can tell. I can smell it from a

170
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:26,980
million miles away. Unfortunately, your boredom is going to have to continue for the next four

171
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:35,619
to six hours because I'm going to play my fucking $2,000 CSGO knife skin until I'm satisfied looking

172
00:32:35,619 --> 00:33:01,539
at it with all my friends over. And I lost because of you. The argument is you could have

173
00:33:01,539 --> 00:33:09,500
emulated it. Okay. So I, all right. Yeah. So I, I can like, I can watch a streamer open up knives

174
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,099
and like, I can watch him hold a knife in his hands. I don't own it though.

175
00:33:13,819 --> 00:33:25,140
I'm pretending to own it. Right? That could happen. I could download a JPEG of a CSGO knife

176
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:37,210
and put it on my background on my desktop. Is that the same thing? That mission was too hard.

177
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:52,390
Do I look like I know what a J? Wait, you guys don't know JPEG? Holy shit. In the middle of this,

178
00:33:52,390 --> 00:34:05,319
somebody gave a fucking ton of money. Do I know what emulation is? I used dolphin like a month ago.

179
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:34,340
You guys are fucking bored. Uh, phylatrial lich gave $250 in that's 25,000 fucking bits.

180
00:34:38,789 --> 00:34:43,110
And they say, here's money to buy another copy of Gotcha Force just for you to flex on chat.

181
00:34:44,070 --> 00:35:00,420
I don't want another copy of Gotcha Force. Donating to millionaires. Are we going to do,

182
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:30,010
are we going to bring that up again? Worth house. All right. I'm just going to play my game and I'm,

183
00:35:30,889 --> 00:35:41,429
I'll see, I'll talk to you guys like an hour. See you guys in an hour. He's not denying. We've

184
00:35:41,429 --> 00:35:46,630
already gone over the fact that I don't have a million dollars. I don't have a million dollars.

185
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,219
I'm not a millionaire. Why do we have to keep talking about this?

186
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:49,800
He's lying. He's lying about the company he owns. That would be fucking, that would be,

187
00:36:49,800 --> 00:37:11,500
I think that's probably illegal. Offshore accounts. No, I don't have any of those.

188
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:34,280
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. All right. I see it. I see it. I see it. He's a liar.

189
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:41,610
Liar. Let's see. What does it say? My net worth between one and $5 million in 2019.

190
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:46,570
Okay. This is, this is one, this is so inaccurate. It's always like a joke.

191
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:59,260
Do you guys know that these websites have no fucking idea? They have absolutely no idea.

192
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:09,780
You know, these websites pull from how many like clicks your website got.

193
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:19,619
Monthly traffic was 68,000 people per month, which that means he's worth $60 million dollars.

194
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,480
Somebody showed me one of these websites before and it said I was worth like $200 billion dollars.

195
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:41,210
Yeah, that's great. So I'm worth like the total GDP of like 50 countries on earth. Sure. I guess.

196
00:38:41,849 --> 00:39:03,610
Okay. Sure. Five million fucking dollars. Get the fuck out of here. Celebrity money.

197
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:08,380
God, this is probably like a data mining website. Like, why are you clicking these?

198
00:39:19,909 --> 00:39:28,730
E-celebrity cash. Well, let's wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Yeah. Calculator stats.com.

199
00:39:29,929 --> 00:39:33,369
German nine a five's net worth is approximately $112,000.

200
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:51,320
He's a millionaire. He's a fucking millionaire. How much money did German make today? $49.

201
00:39:52,440 --> 00:40:15,139
Let me buy him my second Lamborghini. That's all right. Okay. Okay. Guys, the main

202
00:40:15,139 --> 00:40:21,030
YouTube channel, I don't want to be completely transparent about the, okay. The main YouTube

203
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:43,829
channel makes about, uh, four to $500 a month. So no, it's not worth $112,000. It's more like

204
00:40:43,829 --> 00:41:06,889
12,000 or like 8,000. What about the second channel? The second channel as of, as of like

205
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:16,280
this, I don't make, okay, listen, I'm going to be, let's be transparent here. So the second channel,

206
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:24,889
I do not have a majority revenue from. And as of bringing on potentially two or three more editors,

207
00:41:24,889 --> 00:41:31,539
I am not taking a cent from the second channel. I don't, I don't receive any money from it. It's

208
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:38,659
going to be going out to the editors. I'm not going to take a dollar. Zero. As of, because otherwise

209
00:41:38,659 --> 00:41:42,840
I wouldn't be able to, I wouldn't be able to afford to pay. You know, if we have like four or

210
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:47,579
five editors on that channel, I mean that that channel doesn't make enough money to support

211
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:55,659
like four people a month. So I've just, I'm just, that's just, I'm not going to take any money.

212
00:41:55,659 --> 00:42:09,750
Why would I do that? But that the main, we're talking about the main channel. The main channel

213
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:23,239
doesn't like, you're not paying your redditors. You're wait, wait, wait, what? Yes. I don't,

214
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:30,119
the editors right now get a majority of the ad revenue from that channel. Yes. Wait, what? You

215
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:48,900
guys didn't think I was doing that? And real soon, my, my like cut from the second channel is going

216
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:56,630
to be zero. Absolute zero. I'm not going to take any money. I'm just going to, I need to, I need to

217
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:05,510
be able to be sustainable to have another two or three people on. It's paying his redditors.

218
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:22,409
What the fuck is this? Bench the bomber. I'm getting accused of things here. Net worth,

219
00:43:22,409 --> 00:43:40,380
Forbes 100 list, Jeremy Albertson, $985 billion. All right. TLDW, too long, didn't watch.

220
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:57,000
Collecting crayons is the same thing as me buying gotcha force and stamps and shit and coins.

221
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:30,099
Too long, didn't watch. Stamps are cooler. No, they're not. You think a stamp is cooler

222
00:44:30,099 --> 00:44:43,110
than gotcha force? No, they're not. Now I'm angry. All right, here we go. Here comes the gunner.

223
00:44:48,940 --> 00:45:19,190
No, I caught, I was stuck to them. All right, here we go. $112,000. What's that? What are

224
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:26,420
they even calculating? How many subscribers the channel has? Gotcha force is an emulated

225
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:43,539
stamp collection. Thank you. Oh, mirror subs and views. How does like a subscribe to the

226
00:45:43,539 --> 00:45:48,619
channel translate to how much money the channel is worth? Is that what somebody would, is that

227
00:45:48,619 --> 00:45:52,940
what somebody would pay me right now to own that channel or something? Like if I sold it at auction,

228
00:45:52,940 --> 00:46:14,019
would I be like, I want $112,000 for my website. One to five million, $112,000, $10 billion.

229
00:46:14,659 --> 00:46:18,010
Ooh, I want this guy. This guy looks cool. Look at how cool this guy is.

230
00:46:27,289 --> 00:46:39,030
It's the German 985 social media platform. But that's got to be like the biggest hilarious scam

231
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:48,099
ever to pull. Like, can you imagine? Like if all of my entire presence online,

232
00:46:48,099 --> 00:46:54,949
right? Like say every channel, every post, every Twitter, everything, Twitch, everything. What do

233
00:46:54,949 --> 00:46:58,550
you guys think would be worth? If I would be like, I'm selling it and I'm selling it to any company

234
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:12,579
that's willing to pay for it. Probably like 250,000, half a million. Half a million you think?

235
00:47:13,219 --> 00:47:17,880
Okay, if somebody paid me half a million dollars for this, that would be the biggest joke ever.

236
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:24,599
Because the second that it became clear that the German 985 Twitter turned into Crest toothpaste,

237
00:47:26,309 --> 00:47:31,989
you would all leave and no one would ever click anything. It would be the biggest scam ever.

238
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:47,030
Oh, the German 985 Twitch channel just became like A and B realty group. You would see the

239
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:52,630
most unsubscriptions from a channel in a one minute period ever in the history of this website.

240
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:03,179
And then the channel would be worth like 200 dollars that next year.

241
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:09,179
I would add that. So that would be like a 500,000 dollar just to give for free.

242
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:23,829
Just do that but make another channel. I just have a mustache. I don't want another normal night.

243
00:48:23,829 --> 00:48:39,219
Normal night sucks. Just put a mustache on and just have a permanent voice changer

244
00:48:50,099 --> 00:49:04,920
like this. Like that. Just like this forever. And speak with an accent. So I speak with an accent.

245
00:49:05,989 --> 00:49:14,840
And people will think that this is a German. No, I don't know who that is. No.

246
00:49:24,409 --> 00:49:28,260
Awful. It doesn't matter how awful it is. As long as I can be consistent with it.

247
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:36,300
Like for instance, thank you to Silent Serenity for the 250.

248
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:40,519
Hi, German. Now that you're running for public office, we're requesting that you release your

249
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:44,599
tax returns. Will we all unsubscribe if you don't release them within the month?

250
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:51,909
Uh, no, there's no reason. I don't have to do that. There's no reason why I'd have to do that.

251
00:49:51,909 --> 00:49:55,989
Thanks for the 250 though. I would, if I did it for long enough. If I did it for long enough,

252
00:49:55,989 --> 00:50:01,900
I would be able to fucking keep that up forever. It's a good idea. Not consistent. Yes, it was.

253
00:50:02,619 --> 00:50:09,099
What accent do you think I'm doing? An accent. I don't know. Doesn't have to be anything.

254
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:21,929
It just can't be me talking like this. Do the Boston accent.

255
00:50:22,739 --> 00:50:28,570
Hehehe. Just do Bernie for the rest of the stream. No, I'm not going to do that.

256
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:37,849
You know, you guys, you know, you guys are breaking the number one rule that every

257
00:50:37,849 --> 00:50:43,690
friend is supposed to not break. Talking about money. How much money do you make?

258
00:50:44,409 --> 00:50:59,989
Come on. I thought we were supposed to be friends. It's rude. Fucking rude. Hello.

259
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:23,960
Bench the bomber. Bench the bomber. Bench the bomber. Okay. All right. Thanks for the advice.

260
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:42,889
Oh, sorry. Thanks for the voice. Now, do I put in the dragon? I can't. I couldn't do it.

261
00:51:43,699 --> 00:51:53,079
I can't. I can't do it. What's an accent I could do just forever? Um, I guess it could be something

262
00:51:53,079 --> 00:52:00,309
like this, where I just add an inflection at the end of my sentences. I could do that probably.

263
00:52:00,949 --> 00:52:09,349
I think so. I could do that one. That's the same voice. No, it's not. That's just changing my

264
00:52:09,349 --> 00:52:23,289
cadences. That's you. I don't do that. Put the bomber. No, no. Okay. I got to play. What do I

265
00:52:23,289 --> 00:52:38,380
want? All right. I'm going to do copy man. That's a YouTube documentary voice. Is it possible

266
00:52:39,019 --> 00:52:48,739
that the Mayans had different technology? Could it be that astronauts have joined the Mayans?

267
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:56,780
Yeah, it kind of is. And then even when they're not asking a question, it's still a question.

268
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:08,389
Over 200 million Mayans existed in the year 14 AD. They're still asking a question.

269
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:21,480
You got to speak with confidence and with sincerity. That's a fat earther voice.

270
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:41,579
All right. What's next? This is the perfect guy for this, by the way. Oh, don't get killed.

271
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:55,940
Don't get killed. Fat fuck earth theory. Fat fuck earth theory. Space is incredibly large.

272
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:08,179
Scientists predict that over the next 200 years, Earth might spin at 2% faster than it does now.

273
00:54:09,989 --> 00:54:21,960
Join me in this video as we see exactly how big the Earth can get. Audible.com is a website where

274
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:27,480
you can listen to music and TV shows on your computer. I'll probably spend the next probably

275
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:31,400
four or five minutes talking about this. Over the course of this 20 minute video,

276
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:40,739
we'll take a break to talk about it. And I know. But Earth is a gigantic place. But what if Earth

277
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:54,780
was 10 times larger? Scientists are calling this theory the fat fuck earth theory. We caught up.

278
00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:16,219
Concentrating. Hold on. Don't want to die. I died. Dude, you gaming documentary videos.

279
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:58,179
Oh, dude, I'm hooked. This is a currency thing. This foot lettuce thing. Burger King. I can't. I'm

280
00:55:58,179 --> 00:56:21,099
not going to say that out loud. You guys trying to drop my net worth? Crash his stock. I don't

281
00:56:21,099 --> 00:56:29,690
have any. There's no such thing. There's no ticker for me. Guys, if there was a ticker for this

282
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:35,289
channel, all you memers would just manipulate the fuck out of it. And I would be under investigation

283
00:56:35,289 --> 00:56:43,849
every day. The SEC would have me on speed dial. And I would have to talk to somebody every day.

284
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:49,210
The JR the turbo ticker has said more unusual activity.

285
00:56:51,539 --> 00:56:54,340
I want to ask you a few questions about this. God damn it. Okay, what is it?

286
00:56:55,139 --> 00:57:02,659
Well, it turns out they sold, then bought and then sold it again. $2 million worth of stock.

287
00:57:02,659 --> 00:57:07,860
And it looks I see if you look at this chart. Looks like they spelled out the effort. Fuck

288
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:11,860
in the up and down sells and buys. Are you aware that you did you have anything to do with that?

289
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:16,570
No, I didn't. Actually, I didn't. How do I delist my can I go private again?

290
00:57:29,739 --> 00:57:38,699
No, you can't actually. That'll be a $600,000 fine. I can't but my net worth is only 112.

291
00:57:39,980 --> 00:58:05,909
Looks like you're fucked, kid. Oh, no, no. You already have one. Yeah, but that's just like

292
00:58:05,909 --> 00:58:13,780
pretend goofy money. Every time you buy and sell on that website, all you do is somewhere

293
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:33,940
in the distance, you just hear like, oh, this is for fun. And it's cool. And that's a real I was

294
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:40,539
into that for a little while. I thought it was like a cool thing. This is like an interesting

295
00:58:40,539 --> 00:58:47,130
little that's a that's a fun little project. But it's not, you know, it's not real money.

296
00:58:51,130 --> 00:59:02,500
Derma podcast sucks. I wonder if it gets any and then idiot. Thanks for watching, everybody.

297
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:17,030
See you tomorrow audible.com. Let me see this if this gets any better. I don't want to listen to

298
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:38,469
that. Somebody sat on the clicker. Wikipedia the we encyclopedia that anyone can edit.

299
00:59:41,219 --> 00:59:46,099
Why did you say it like that? Why did you say it like that? Why did you say it like that?

300
00:59:55,719 --> 01:00:10,630
That's a meme. I don't know. All right, let's bring you you you copy man didn't get a chance.

301
01:00:12,679 --> 01:00:49,340
We'll put copy man first. And that's what what Vito Vito just gave. Dude, you're up today. Oh,

302
01:00:50,300 --> 01:01:14,539
we see. Oh, where? I'm not gonna say anything. I'm gonna just watch this.

303
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:46,300
It's crazy just how this reflects like actual looks like stock lines. It's always like a top.

304
01:01:47,099 --> 01:01:52,619
There's I bet you if you did actual TA, like technique, if you did technical analysis,

305
01:01:52,619 --> 01:01:56,780
like they did, like they don't stop tickers. You could find like bottoms,

306
01:01:56,780 --> 01:02:06,599
you could find like, oh, that's a double bottom. That's what we call a, a, a, um, a, um,

307
01:02:08,039 --> 01:02:13,639
ah, I might as well be doing technical analysis, because I can't up.

308
01:02:18,409 --> 01:02:25,050
Yes, it's real. Oh, no, we hit the double top. Okay, I gotta I'll manipulate this. I can't look

309
01:02:25,050 --> 01:03:05,429
at this. We love bottoms. Shut up. Wait, hold on a second. That's like, it's like,

310
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:09,349
holy shit. Elon Musk just tweeted he's made out of titanium.

311
01:03:10,389 --> 01:03:15,539
And he'll live forever. Holy fuck. That's that kind of line.

312
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:41,980
Holy shit. That's the kind of line where it's like this just didn't McDonald's figured out how to

313
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:53,500
print money. Each person goes and gets a happy meal gets $100 and a happy meal. Holy shit.

314
01:04:04,519 --> 01:04:08,119
Wait, why would they figure out how to do that? That's that's against the law.

315
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:18,070
Oh, no, no, no. It would be like this just did. Oh, all cars toys from 2000 to 2005

316
01:04:18,789 --> 01:04:26,469
have appreciated in value by 200 million percent. Only the ones in the McDonald's toy box.

317
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:32,019
Wait, that wouldn't mean that they would that make McDonald's be? Yeah, because then people

318
01:04:32,019 --> 01:04:40,570
be like, holy shit, I gotta buy McDonald's. Here it goes. Here it goes. Here it goes.

319
01:04:40,570 --> 01:05:03,719
Let's make a camel. No, don't laugh at that. You're not done. OK, now I gotta say something

320
01:05:03,719 --> 01:05:11,590
that's not funny, but that is funny at the same time for like the next 40 minutes.

321
01:05:29,079 --> 01:05:51,219
Hey, no, no, no, no. Look at me. Giant enemy spider. No, no, no, no, no, no.

322
01:05:53,739 --> 01:05:59,050
Poopoo, poopoo, peepee, poopoo. I have a poopoo guy. Poopoo, poopoo, poopoo, poopoo, poopoo.

323
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:09,019
That wasn't supposed to be funny. Stop buying.

324
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:20,659
What would happen? What would happen to the stock of like L.O.B.S.T. tweeted like peepee,

325
01:06:20,659 --> 01:06:36,070
poopoo, poopoo, poopoo? Would it go up or down? It would probably go up. It would probably

326
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:44,340
explode in value. I don't know what the fuck that means, but I don't think I'm gonna buy it.

327
01:06:45,139 --> 01:08:07,210
This is such a fun little thing. You ready? Hold on a second. Give me one second. Hold on.

328
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:14,570
No, no, no. I want to get it on screen. I'm not. I'm not doing what you think I'm doing. I promise.

329
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:52,729
Holy shit. OK, hold on. Let's keep this on for a little while. This is funny to me.

330
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:47,100
Oh, he's going to play. Quick sell. See? Oh, yeah, you got to see the time. OK, there we go.

331
01:09:47,100 --> 01:10:10,390
All right, let's go. A little too big. So if you want to see why I thought this was a funny idea

332
01:10:10,390 --> 01:10:15,260
at first and then I thought this was a really, really, really bad fucking idea. And I was going

333
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:22,680
to actually have somebody make an extension for this, like build out an extension that did this.

334
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:31,619
But you will see that it is now. It's it would be like we talked about this yesterday, didn't we?

335
01:10:31,619 --> 01:10:34,739
I couldn't. It would be like it would be all I think about. I wouldn't be able to concentrate

336
01:10:34,739 --> 01:11:39,079
on anything. Quick do a Shpee stimulus package. Oh, there was an estimate that there was going

337
01:11:39,079 --> 01:11:46,250
to be a Shpee stimulus package and it didn't happen. Oh, shit. All the investors were expecting

338
01:11:46,250 --> 01:12:03,180
it. It didn't happen. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. No, yeah, it's like it's it's 430.

339
01:12:03,899 --> 01:12:25,750
We're waiting for a Shpee announcement here. What was going on? Investors, German 985 comedy

340
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:32,300
investors around the world are stuck right now. They don't know what to do. They were expecting

341
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:50,090
this and those that bought in very, very early back in 2011, they're still holding and they're

342
01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:52,890
but they might start to sell. We're going to see some real capitulation here.

343
01:12:59,579 --> 01:13:03,510
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. We're going to get we got a live feed from German 95

344
01:13:04,069 --> 01:13:12,500
bedroom. Here he is. I slept in way too late. I slept in like way too late.

345
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:34,979
Investors around the world are weighing what they think about this. Is that too that may

346
01:13:34,979 --> 01:13:53,369
have been too much stimulus? See how they feel about it. Trying that the the bulls are really

347
01:13:53,369 --> 01:14:09,689
trying to take this up. Yeah, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna find out how to do this.

348
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:13,289
I'm gonna make like a comedy currency that's like built in with an extension

349
01:14:13,930 --> 01:14:16,649
so people can like buy and sell comedy currency on this channel.

350
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:23,140
Even if it's only like active for like fucking a week. It'll only be live for like a week.

351
01:14:23,779 --> 01:14:41,939
This is like funny. But this this is like insane. Do channel points. Oh my god.

352
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:49,770
Channel points. Okay. Yeah, we could do channel points. Channel points for like the IPO. Like

353
01:14:49,770 --> 01:14:55,829
you have a bunch of them right now. You like got into the initial what? ICO. Initial Comedy.

354
01:14:55,829 --> 01:15:03,350
I don't know. That's I don't want to use that. Initial Comedy Offering. No, I don't want to use

355
01:15:03,350 --> 01:15:19,909
ICO. Don't want to do that. Hey guys, I'm making an ICO. That would be very bad. I don't I would

356
01:15:19,909 --> 01:15:40,680
not want to say that one. Initial Comedy Offering. It's kind of like sad in a way. Last time you

357
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:46,600
heard somebody say that they were going to do an ICO. Holy shit. That's like 2016 2017.

358
01:15:47,479 --> 01:16:18,789
I got to figure out how to do this because I think it'd be fun. They started right next to me.

359
01:16:18,789 --> 01:16:38,779
I could have just put one of these guys in. Bugleberry is going to crash the market.

360
01:16:53,850 --> 01:17:06,760
But I love Bugleberry. I think this could be fun for like a week. I have a pretend like

361
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:14,779
Twitch comedy traded channel points. That's built into that's baked into the channel.

362
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:22,869
And like people could buy and sell. And you could just lose a bunch of channel points and stuff.

363
01:17:22,869 --> 01:17:35,659
We'll gain some. I have to be very clear. It's like I'm gonna be clear now about it to just

364
01:17:35,659 --> 01:17:40,220
because I fucking have to say this and I'm going to say this. All of this is a comedy routine.

365
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:46,060
Like this is all a joke. It's a comedy routine. And nothing. It's not real value. It's just fake.

366
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:51,579
It's just fun. A little joke. That's not if it's real. You make sure I'm very clear about that.

367
01:17:57,829 --> 01:18:13,670
What? I have to say that. This is a stock market parody without real value.

368
01:18:18,119 --> 01:18:22,039
None of this is financial advice. It never was and it never will be.

369
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:33,159
Wait, are you guys selling because I'm telling you it's fake? Is that why?

370
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:42,600
No. CEO of German 95 Enterprises says that all of money in his stock is not even real.

371
01:18:46,869 --> 01:18:54,090
It's not real money. CEO of major company says, sorry guys, I have to make this really clear.

372
01:18:54,090 --> 01:19:07,930
Oh, the stock is worthless. It's not real. Holy shit, that would be insane.

373
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:20,170
And this would be funny for like a week. But that's all it could be there for. Because you know.

374
01:19:20,170 --> 01:19:23,930
Because with everything, it doesn't even matter if it's not even real. There will be little groups

375
01:19:23,930 --> 01:19:29,369
that like forming it like, all right, at 830 am, we're gonna dump it and then we're gonna

376
01:19:29,369 --> 01:19:33,609
there'd be like discord calls about this. You know, it's gonna happen. But it'll be a little

377
01:19:33,609 --> 01:20:06,840
experiment. It's already it's happening now. This is one of those charts where if you like

378
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:14,060
owned a stock in here, you it doesn't matter if it's like 8am or 8pm. You've probably opened

379
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:25,220
a bottle of whiskey. Holy shit. Oh my god. What the fuck? What do I do? This is fucked.

380
01:20:27,159 --> 01:20:42,729
Try to like turn it off. Or do I do I buy it? Or do I sell it? I've gone up and down in

381
01:20:42,729 --> 01:20:55,619
portfolio value 100% both directions in 10 minutes. Oh, I think I I think I'm gonna take a bath.

382
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:19,819
I think it went off the screen. Yeah. And then there's going to be the people that just want to

383
01:21:19,819 --> 01:21:27,260
watch the world burn, right? And they're just going to sell and buy at the same price and just

384
01:21:27,979 --> 01:21:43,960
manipulate it. So it goes up and down like a heart monitor. No matter what. Oh, shit, I'm gonna lose.

385
01:21:50,949 --> 01:21:56,069
Okay, I'd have to put some like, some like rules in. And maybe you could only do a certain amount

386
01:21:56,069 --> 01:22:12,329
of like a certain amount a day or a stream. I don't know. Oh, I also have to put this on

387
01:22:12,329 --> 01:22:17,260
screen too. This is hold on. I don't want people to think that like if they just come in right now

388
01:22:17,260 --> 01:23:22,680
and it's like, well, what stock is this? You know what I mean? Like I got to hold on. Oh, shit.

389
01:23:23,239 --> 01:24:05,819
Oh my god. I'm kind of Oh, I just lost right there. Hold on. Did I lose it? Did I win the loss? It's

390
01:24:05,819 --> 01:24:09,659
not supposed to be funny. That's not supposed to be funny. That's I don't want people to come in

391
01:24:09,659 --> 01:24:15,720
here and be like, what the fuck are they doing? You know what I mean? Like it went up and it went

392
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:23,350
down and then it went up and it went down. No, no, no, no, no. Like this is very clear that we're

393
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:31,260
just this is a this is a fake my streams comedy ticker. Somebody's gave $50.

394
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:49,239
Kajtech thanks for the 5000 bits. $50. Dermot, I have to inform you as a lawyer that this concept

395
01:24:49,239 --> 01:24:54,439
already exists. It's twitch stocks. I'll be forced to minus two your stream if you do not cease and

396
01:24:54,439 --> 01:25:00,789
desist. Well, no, I'm we're doing we're talking about comedy points. This is not a stock. This

397
01:25:00,789 --> 01:25:07,109
is a comedy point. I'm a comedy point. Don't call it a ticker. This is a comedy point.

398
01:25:18,569 --> 01:25:22,170
I almost turned on the webcam and I don't have a shirt on. I was going to be that would have been

399
01:25:22,170 --> 01:25:26,810
like buy or sell. I don't know that would have moved. That would have moved the comedy points

400
01:25:26,810 --> 01:25:45,850
a lot in some direction. I almost did it. It was close. Yeah, I got to get okay. I don't like copy

401
01:25:45,850 --> 01:26:05,189
manners. Oh, who can I fit? Man, man, girl. And we have come on, Gwen. I like it. I like this new

402
01:26:05,189 --> 01:26:40,729
group. You have to show it now or we're going to dump your comedy point. I'm not going to be naked

403
01:26:40,729 --> 01:26:50,250
on camera. Yes, if you want to if you want to dump my fake comedy points, which doesn't affect me,

404
01:26:52,789 --> 01:26:58,970
where being like naked on stream ends my career. And then this channel really won't be worth

405
01:26:58,970 --> 01:27:07,319
anything. And then that that little net worth thing that you that you linked that goes zero.

406
01:27:20,859 --> 01:27:23,260
I am going to figure out how to get that to work though. I think that's funny.

407
01:27:36,229 --> 01:28:16,229
You guys are going off the screen. Oh my god. I fucking hate clicking on shit. Stop.

408
01:28:18,329 --> 01:28:29,239
I don't think that's effective. CEO of comedy company sees comedy points drop by 80% in one

409
01:28:29,239 --> 01:28:58,819
hour tweets stop. Shocked that it didn't work. How do I get this guy, this bird guy? He's so fast.

410
01:28:59,380 --> 01:29:21,210
Take him out. Take him out. Take him out. Take him out. We still want face cam. No,

411
01:29:21,210 --> 01:29:41,189
I'm not turning on face cam. I love this. You know, it's really funny. I love watching the

412
01:29:41,189 --> 01:30:17,670
people type in minus five. It don't work like that. Sorry. What happened here? I woke up

413
01:30:19,189 --> 01:30:31,140
in the morning and I saw I just looked at the chart. What's the news? Oh, CEO, CEO tweeted out

414
01:30:31,939 --> 01:30:38,979
picture of asshole with two middle fingers on it and said fuck all investors.

415
01:30:40,310 --> 01:30:43,590
Oh, holy shit. That's the only way this would have happened.

416
01:30:49,020 --> 01:31:16,380
This is not natural. Are you buying that? You shouldn't be purchasing that. Oh, I got one.

417
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:42,970
Finally, acceleration ninja. Oh, imagine buying it up. I don't care. I give a shit if I see the

418
01:31:42,970 --> 01:31:51,340
guy's asshole. The company's still worth $6.7 billion. What's wrong with you guys? Who cares?

419
01:32:07,420 --> 01:32:13,180
CEO tweets picture of asshole with middle fingers and says fuck you to all investors.

420
01:32:14,869 --> 01:32:21,109
And then two minutes later does another tweet shaking hands with two to three scientists

421
01:32:21,109 --> 01:32:51,189
and doctors saying he has the cure for every illness on earth. Holy fuck. Quick. And then

422
01:32:51,189 --> 01:32:57,909
the people, the people that bought like two hours ago that took a shit and came back when it's back

423
01:32:57,909 --> 01:33:09,609
to normal are just like, I'm so glad I had diarrhea. I'm so glad. Holy shit. I was so I

424
01:33:09,609 --> 01:33:16,260
was cursing the toilet and oh my god, I'm so glad I didn't look at this. Thank you. Thank you.

425
01:33:16,260 --> 01:34:18,890
Based diarrhea. You're gross. Back to where it was when you bought it. Derma comedy. JCP now worth

426
01:34:18,890 --> 01:35:02,489
more than oh my god. What the fuck? Activate. Activate. Activate. Derma's got a monopoly in

427
01:35:02,489 --> 01:35:10,100
the Derma comedy point on comedy points. Yeah, the antitrust got involved. He's got to shout

428
01:35:10,100 --> 01:35:18,409
out three YouTubers a week now. Yeah, that was the rolling. That was the rolling from the pretend

429
01:35:19,210 --> 01:35:43,750
exchange people. Okay, you guys understand that this has to be complete comedy and complete

430
01:35:43,750 --> 01:36:10,010
fabrication. When do you get one of these drill tanks? I want one of these things.

431
01:36:10,729 --> 01:36:46,300
I mean, I'm worth five billion. I can get one. Come on. Come on, girl. Come on. Nice shot. Good

432
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:52,300
shot. Good shot. Be funny. What? I can't look. I can't pay. This is why it's only going to be

433
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:57,979
around for a week if I do it. It's I'll never I'll have to be like, what is that? What is that?

434
01:36:57,979 --> 01:37:11,369
What is that? What is that? Is she the last one? No, who's left? Oh, shit. Okay, I gotta be careful.

435
01:37:19,590 --> 01:37:30,359
Oh, oh, he just slam dunked me out of nowhere. Oh, fuck. Bad. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

436
01:37:30,359 --> 01:37:53,829
Yes. Thank God. Big Mitz. Big Mitz. Oh, you're right. It's $50 from ACDC freak. Thanks for the

437
01:37:54,390 --> 01:38:01,270
five. Finally, a tank. Thanks for the 50 bucks. 5000 bits. Thank you so much for all the laughs

438
01:38:01,270 --> 01:38:04,470
you've given me over the years. You helped me through so much, especially during these really

439
01:38:04,470 --> 01:38:08,310
hard times. Thank you again for all you do. Thanks for the fucking incredibly kind message. And thanks

440
01:38:08,310 --> 01:38:22,069
for the huge amount of money. It's just 50 bucks, like $50. Thank you. Finally, a drill tank. Give

441
01:38:22,069 --> 01:38:34,359
me two of those. Finally, a drill tank. All right. Hold on a minute here. One of these revolver

442
01:38:34,359 --> 01:38:45,500
gunmen have a blue shirt on. Yeah. Why do you have a blue shirt on? What's the difference?

443
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:06,279
What? It's just a different color. Oh, all right. Time to clean this up. All right. To the warehouse.

444
01:39:08,859 --> 01:39:24,739
I'm not ever going to use you to the warehouse. You are new though. Samurai. Oh, rolling slash.

445
01:39:24,739 --> 01:39:35,609
I'll get, I'll try them. We have too many of these revolvers. Warehouse. Warehouse.

446
01:39:38,140 --> 01:39:45,909
Somebody, what is it? Yeah. You're level three. Warehouse. You can stay. I don't,

447
01:39:45,909 --> 01:39:53,020
wire girl. No, no, no. I don't know. Probably not going to use wire girl. I got to clean this up.

448
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:55,979
I got to get rid of that. I told you, look at the title. I got to get rid of my fucking toys.

449
01:39:56,779 --> 01:40:04,140
I'm not going to use spinner girl. Go over here. I might need you eventually.

450
01:40:04,859 --> 01:40:16,710
I want to try the tank and I want to try the, what's acceleration ninja speed type, mid air,

451
01:40:17,670 --> 01:40:23,510
kamaitachi, kamaitachi, and then ninpo full throttle. Oh, he's got wheels. This guy's cool.

452
01:40:24,390 --> 01:40:30,340
The fastest gachaborg in the assassination unit. The amazing speed of his ninpo full throttle

453
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:38,329
sends any enemy that bumps into him flying. Cool. I mean, they're new. I have to try them.

454
01:40:38,890 --> 01:40:54,779
Here we go. Yeah. What animal cleaning I need to do? Yeah. I'll do it later. I'll do it later. I'll

455
01:40:54,939 --> 01:41:00,140
do it later. I'll do it later. I see. I do that so often. How many of you guys start cleaning your

456
01:41:00,140 --> 01:41:06,409
room and you see just how much shit you have to do. You pick up like three pieces of paper

457
01:41:06,409 --> 01:41:12,199
and wipe just the area you can see with your eyes. And then you go, fuck, there's so much.

458
01:41:13,319 --> 01:41:19,050
That was a good start. And then it doesn't happen again until you need to clean the room again.

459
01:41:19,770 --> 01:41:29,380
It happens all the time to me. Plus two better than nothing.

460
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:41,939
I don't want to do the boss battle. I want to do this. I don't know if I like these new units.

461
01:41:41,939 --> 01:41:57,050
As a homeowner, I know what you mean. Yes. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. All right. Let's check the samurai.

462
01:42:03,909 --> 01:42:28,060
He is fast, isn't he? He is fast. He's fast. He's fire. Think fire. Think fire. Think fire.

463
01:42:28,060 --> 01:42:31,100
But why am I getting minus two? Because you guys don't know what the fuck that is.

464
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:40,199
Not even Kingdom Hearts fans. Holy shit. Holy shit. Not even Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 fans.

465
01:42:44,020 --> 01:42:52,579
I mean, Kingdom Hearts 3. But the first two. Those were good. Weren't they?

466
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:10,710
Wait a minute. That was my favorite game. Minus two. Minus two. Minus two. Minus two. Minus three.

467
01:43:10,710 --> 01:43:14,869
Minus three. Minus three. Minus two. Minus three. I'm going to do minus three because I love

468
01:43:14,869 --> 01:43:36,869
Kingdom Hearts 3. Minus two. Minus three. In the middle of all this, somebody just writes,

469
01:43:37,670 --> 01:43:55,220
dude, chill. You're right. I'll chill. You're right. This guy's good. He's a little beefier

470
01:43:55,220 --> 01:44:26,789
than the other one. The tank. Actually pretty good. Really, really beefy too. It's got to be,

471
01:44:26,789 --> 01:44:32,229
you got to hit. This would be really good against big units. I can't really dodge that well. That's

472
01:44:32,229 --> 01:44:39,800
actually really good. Nice. I love it. It has a lot of health. Oh yeah. I guess, no, it can jump.

473
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:52,060
All right. That's cool. Lay an egg on screen. So you want me to go get like a comedy egg

474
01:44:52,619 --> 01:44:56,710
and for like two or three months, make you really aware that I'm sitting on it.

475
01:44:59,479 --> 01:45:15,909
And then after like a month or two, have it hatch on screen. And I play the Jurassic Park.

476
01:45:17,029 --> 01:45:29,850
Look at how cute that is music. And then the thing attaches to my face. It's just biting me

477
01:45:29,850 --> 01:45:33,609
and I like destroy the room because it's latching on. I won't let go. And it's like killing me and

478
01:45:33,609 --> 01:45:49,930
hurting me in this free man. Like an alien face hugger is just like, Oh, look at how cute it is.

479
01:45:55,020 --> 01:46:00,220
Oh, wow. Look at him. Come on. Come on. And I'm like, Oh my God.

480
01:46:00,619 --> 01:46:05,659
Please. I'm like running around like bumping into walls and shit about the thing. Like is

481
01:46:05,659 --> 01:46:23,189
feeding off of my blood. It's like a three week break. And I just got, I come back wearing a

482
01:46:23,189 --> 01:46:35,720
neck brace. Like he clearly is like biting me on the shoulder, like on like the arm.

483
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:47,060
And I come back with a neck brace on. That's pretty good. I think, I think that would be fun.

484
01:46:47,859 --> 01:46:53,000
You spoiled the whole joke. Yeah. You'll forget when it happens in like six months.

485
01:46:53,880 --> 01:47:06,260
Showdown to the death base. Put a dog cone on. I keep, I keep like trying to like put my head

486
01:47:06,260 --> 01:47:13,340
over and like lick. I'm just like, God damn it. Oh, I just want to come on. That's pretty good.

487
01:47:14,140 --> 01:47:23,159
I'll see you in six months when this happens. I put my foot up and like try to get under and

488
01:47:23,159 --> 01:47:37,029
like get it off by like scratching underneath. Like my foot comes up and have like big fake

489
01:47:37,029 --> 01:47:40,470
dog feet made. So like, I can just have like a little bar that I pull up and it's a big dog

490
01:47:40,470 --> 01:48:05,220
foot and I'm going to scratch under. All right. Oh shit. This is a real battle. Wait, having dog

491
01:48:05,220 --> 01:48:10,500
feet is too far, but having an alien creature that hatches out of an egg latches onto my face

492
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:29,350
and is killing me. It's not too far. I must make, make sure I'm clear on this. Okay. Oh, it's this,

493
01:48:29,350 --> 01:48:33,750
this is the hardest enemy in the whole game. I hate these guys. It's so, they have so much health.

494
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:52,380
They're so strong. They can move so quickly. They have to think. Look at that axe. I was trying to

495
01:48:52,380 --> 01:49:09,159
go in whatever tank time. It's a good hit. Even if I have to trade here, it's fine. This is his best

496
01:49:09,159 --> 01:49:16,840
unit. Speaking of, Oh yeah, this is done. Nice. Look at that. Look at the GF go down. Another one

497
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:26,699
except it's, she's come on. Okay. It's all right. It's all right. Who's next. I don't have play with

498
01:49:26,699 --> 01:49:45,590
this guy. Oh my God. Where is he? Holy shit. This guy's insane. He's too good. I don't know how to

499
01:49:45,590 --> 01:50:14,520
use them. Stop. Stop. Stop it. I love the way he skates around too. What is this charge? It's so

500
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:33,300
long. Oh, it's just a big AOE. Come on, block it. Come on. You don't even know how to use that.

501
01:50:33,300 --> 01:51:12,100
What? Juggle. Juggle. I think who's next. Thank you. So you beat me. Vito, I'll give you this.

502
01:51:12,100 --> 01:51:19,100
This belonged to my father. When you have three of them, the gate will open. I got three. I've got

503
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:50,600
three. Why did his father have a death crystal? I don't know. Beat the deadly UFOs. I like this

504
01:51:50,600 --> 01:52:26,760
team. Stop making fun of kids. Not a bad graph. We're doing all right. Can I get on top of that?

505
01:52:29,189 --> 01:52:42,869
Oh, probably should have picked somebody that has better long range capabilities. I don't know why

506
01:52:42,869 --> 01:53:11,560
this is in my head. Why is this in my head? Destroy. Destroy. Why is it in my head? Imagine

507
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:43,529
not playing Star Fox 64. Yeah, I know. This thing is better than Spikehead. You were like 23 when

508
01:53:43,529 --> 01:53:56,359
this game came out. How old do you think I am? 23? How old do you think I am? Honestly, this game

509
01:53:56,359 --> 01:54:21,960
came out in 2003. How old is he now? 28. The death gate has opened. Nice. I need the dream team here.

510
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:48,279
Save the game. It's been like a year. I was like 17. Do the math. 85 to 2003. I was like 17. Let's

511
01:54:48,279 --> 01:55:12,180
see. 85 plus 10 is 95. 85. 95 plus 10 is 100. 2005. So subtract three years. I was 17 years old,

512
01:55:12,180 --> 01:55:31,020
not 23. My God. Getting rid of you. Let's get Spikehead. He's just very efficient.

513
01:55:31,739 --> 01:55:37,000
Well, I need efficient. You are probably going to be good here because you've just been spam.

514
01:55:38,699 --> 01:55:45,289
You'll be good here. We got 300 more points. Basically the same thing. This is not the same

515
01:55:45,289 --> 01:56:02,310
thing. Why is he so mad all the time? Because I don't even have blood. It's just liquid

516
01:56:02,310 --> 01:56:16,890
fucking gas. It's like a hot burning liquid. I have lava for blood. Let's see. Liquid water.

517
01:56:16,890 --> 01:56:29,939
He's got Mountain Dew for blood. This last slot is important. Who do I want on the plane maybe?

518
01:56:30,579 --> 01:56:41,420
Yeah. This plane's good. He's got code red in his blood. The decisive battle. Defeat the Cosmic

519
01:56:41,420 --> 01:56:49,930
Dragon. This must be the death gate to the Death Fortress. This place is going to be your grave.

520
01:56:50,569 --> 01:56:55,989
You wish. Let's go. Defeat the Cosmic Dragon. Who do we need for this one?

521
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:29,739
Heavy hitters like Tsutomu. Is it the Ender Dragon? Fire. You missed.

522
01:57:30,460 --> 01:57:45,369
Oh. Why is it bouncing off? Oh, he's got that portal. Holy shit. He's dead. I'm going to kill

523
01:57:45,369 --> 01:57:56,979
a dragon with this one guy. He's dead. There's more than one dragon. This game. I think it sucks.

524
01:58:03,460 --> 01:58:24,550
No. Stop. Turn the fan off. Turn the fan off. Kill. Pissing into the wind. Is there any more

525
01:58:24,550 --> 01:58:46,869
Ender Dragons? No. Point blank. Got it. Point blank. Uh oh. This is bad. This is bad. This is

526
01:58:46,869 --> 01:59:05,829
bad. Bad. Bad. Good thing I got this guy. Okay. One more. Oh. Get back over there and hit him in the

527
01:59:05,829 --> 01:59:38,569
head. Oh my. How many more fucking guys do you have? Here we go. That's his last guy. Got it.

528
01:59:38,569 --> 01:59:52,789
What do you have left? What the fuck? This is not fair. Back up. Where the fuck is my friend?

529
01:59:52,789 --> 02:00:02,310
Where's my head? Give me that. What do you have left? This is ridiculous. That's the Ender Dragon.

530
02:00:02,310 --> 02:00:22,220
Okay. This is the Ender Dragon. What's that mean? I got to get my head. Oh. Oh. Don't. Oh. That hurt.

531
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:47,750
No. No. We need that power up. Oh, who's left? All right. Sniper Girl. Is anybody apt to Sniper

532
02:00:47,750 --> 02:00:54,229
Girl or is this it? Oh, underneath. Go underneath. Underneath. Underneath. Underneath. Underneath.

533
02:00:54,229 --> 02:01:16,699
Underneath. Get out from under there. Yes. That was a secret mission, by the way. I definitely got

534
02:01:16,699 --> 02:01:26,039
something cool. But, uh, I had a plan after that. Nice. I thought that was my last character.

535
02:01:29,699 --> 02:01:56,279
Oh, hell yeah. Oh, yeah. Elemental Knight and a Thanatos. 100 energy. My headaches.

536
02:01:56,840 --> 02:02:05,800
What am I doing? You fool. Galactic Emperor. You can't stop me. The time draws near.

537
02:02:17,590 --> 02:02:27,140
That's the haunted house when you're like eight and one of the lunch ladies at your school is

538
02:02:28,119 --> 02:02:39,109
behind the microphone doing a scary voice. What happened? All right. I made that joke. Do it again.

539
02:02:39,670 --> 02:02:51,100
What's going on? Made that exact joke before. Twice. Guys, I've said every word in the dictionary

540
02:02:51,100 --> 02:02:57,880
at this point, so I might repeat a joke or two once every like three years. Sorry. Grownups have

541
02:02:57,880 --> 02:03:02,100
finally noticed the Death Force, but they don't know what to do. What? Of course, they have no

542
02:03:02,100 --> 02:03:10,260
idea what we are dealing with. Right. Only Gachaborgs can defeat Gachaborgs. Um, I think

543
02:03:10,260 --> 02:03:13,380
if you just, if you were an adult and you picked up one of these toys and snapped it in half,

544
02:03:13,380 --> 02:03:37,770
that would work. Let's split up and take them on separately. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Elemental

545
02:03:37,770 --> 02:03:47,029
Knight. Elemental Punch. Elemental Sword. And Elemental Slash. This strange Gachaborg's armor

546
02:03:47,029 --> 02:03:52,710
is empty. And as life force appears to be contained in his sword, his elemental sword was forged to

547
02:03:52,710 --> 02:04:06,859
destroy a legendary ancient knight. Hope you're not bad. Okay. I like this. I'm gonna do Elemental

548
02:04:06,859 --> 02:04:30,359
Knight. Listen, Vito, you gotta help me. To the warehouse? No. Does Elemental Knight have a sword?

549
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:40,699
What just happened? I just died. What happened? Why did he explode? He's, oh, I got a defective

550
02:04:40,699 --> 02:05:00,970
one. He's broken. I have to return it. He's cool. I got a broken one. Okay.

551
02:05:01,850 --> 02:05:11,560
Uh, well, command girl, just fly away. Just get the hell away. Get the hell away. Just get the hell

552
02:05:11,560 --> 02:05:29,449
away. Get the hell out of here. I just out ran it. Plane! Come on, plane clutch, plane clutch,

553
02:05:29,449 --> 02:05:37,180
plane clutch, plane clutch, plane clutch, plane clutch. They all crashed into each other. That

554
02:05:37,180 --> 02:06:11,260
was perfect. Sunnyside Park is safe. Good. No, I need to save it. Yeah. Let's do this one. These

555
02:06:11,260 --> 02:06:21,539
ones are the important ones, right? You're late. I want to see, I want to play with the knight.

556
02:06:22,340 --> 02:06:43,340
Here we go. Okay. Dude, he's got some good, he's got a cool combo. What's the other one do? What?

557
02:06:43,340 --> 02:06:55,529
Okay. What is that? He explodes. Oh, he formed. Am I not targetable when that happens? That's

558
02:06:55,529 --> 02:07:04,260
actually pretty great. Oh, you shoot your hand out. It's like a rocket punch. Do not target.

559
02:07:04,260 --> 02:07:39,140
Holy shit. This guy's awesome. I'm kicking the shit out of this guy. Rocket punch. Wow.

560
02:07:40,890 --> 02:07:45,609
He's so powerful with the power. When you get the superpower, he's so good.

561
02:07:46,409 --> 02:08:02,390
When you're juggling them around, come on. What happened? Somebody said, oh my god, the minus two

562
02:08:02,390 --> 02:08:16,869
and plus two grab. Yeah, this is bullshit going on earlier. It's all right. That punch is really

563
02:08:16,869 --> 02:08:47,670
effective too. This is really good. I haven't even had to change characters and wham. Crash, crash,

564
02:08:47,670 --> 02:09:13,029
crash. There's no reason to. This guy's dodging me. Don't like it. Dude, I just did half his health in

565
02:09:13,029 --> 02:09:27,369
one hit. Bang. Oh, you know, you're a streamer. Cool stuff going on on the screen. You haven't

566
02:09:27,369 --> 02:09:47,609
said anything in a while. Bang. Bang. Right there. Nice. Streaming tips. The German 985. Nice. Bang.

567
02:09:48,250 --> 02:09:55,079
Great turn on the face cam. No, I'm not going to turn on the face cam. How many bullets? What the

568
02:09:55,079 --> 02:10:17,979
fuck? This game is so good. Everything's not about face cam. Okay. Good shot. That was a long range.

569
02:10:17,979 --> 02:10:33,880
That was a blue plate special. Do another one. Oh, I just missed it. Back, back, back. No. No.

570
02:10:33,880 --> 02:10:55,140
Give me the head. No. Top of the top of your head. Let's punch him. What? What's going on here?

571
02:10:56,439 --> 02:11:20,659
Hey. No face cam. Oh my god. A chainsaw knight. These guys have kicked the shit out of me through

572
02:11:20,659 --> 02:11:37,739
the whole game and now I got one. What is that? A lance knight? I could have it. Holy fuck. We're

573
02:11:37,739 --> 02:11:57,000
getting a lot of stuff. Come on. Is it two of them? Is that it? Did I get lucky? Where's the

574
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:06,890
chainsaw knight? There you are. Huge damage. No weapon. Just has wire arm and chainsword.

575
02:12:07,699 --> 02:12:12,979
Chainsaw Knight is a breakaway soldier from the Knightborg Corps. He wields a huge chainsword

576
02:12:12,979 --> 02:12:17,380
and can slash anything to pieces. Grab enemies with the wire arm and then slash them with the

577
02:12:17,460 --> 02:12:29,020
sword. Nice. All right. We're going to have to... What's more important? Plane's going to have...

578
02:12:30,550 --> 02:12:34,630
Sorry, command girl. I know you're level three and you're one of the best characters that I have,

579
02:12:34,630 --> 02:12:56,939
but I'm sorry. I need to try a chainsaw guy. Everybody's selling. Sell. I didn't save it.

580
02:12:58,569 --> 02:13:08,819
No, my life savings. The plane's mediocre. Yeah, but it's really good to maneuver around.

581
02:13:25,689 --> 02:13:34,390
Wait, is this like having a movie on in the back seat? The graph is having a movie on in

582
02:13:34,390 --> 02:13:42,229
the back seat of a car? What do you mean? Don't hurt me. Defeat enemy, got you more.

583
02:13:48,069 --> 02:13:53,449
It's distracting. That's what I mean. That's why if I do this, I only want to do this for like a week

584
02:13:54,250 --> 02:14:21,539
and have it be real for a little bit. Can I pull the whole ship? Kind of. This guy wasn't really

585
02:14:21,539 --> 02:14:43,699
made for this, was he? Okay. That was not a good representation of what he does. Fire, fire, fire,

586
02:14:43,699 --> 02:15:04,300
fire, fire, fire. Missiles. Missiles. Oh, that's not good. All right. Tank versus tank. Jesus.

587
02:15:05,020 --> 02:15:23,510
What is even firing at me? Doing a lot of damage, but what are you? What are you? I can't move.

588
02:15:23,989 --> 02:15:44,329
I'm stuck. I have a debuff. Here we go. Melee. Not a good choice. Yeah, not a good choice.

589
02:15:45,289 --> 02:15:52,680
Melee was not the right thing to do. We need long range shooters. We need.

590
02:15:57,180 --> 02:16:23,189
Oh, here's the last resort here. Holy shit, it worked. Give me a hat. Give me one of these hats.

591
02:16:23,989 --> 02:16:37,739
Did I get it? I got him. One more hit and he's dead. I need a hat. Where's one of my hats?

592
02:16:38,459 --> 02:16:50,649
Just avoid him. He'll be killed by this ship. Ship friend will take care of him. Good. Already

593
02:16:50,649 --> 02:17:00,120
back down again. Guys, this shit used to happen to Bitcoin every day for like three months.

594
02:17:02,940 --> 02:17:14,520
You guys just pretending to be the BTC chart from like early 2018. Like somewhere in like the mid

595
02:17:14,520 --> 02:17:31,930
2018. This shit happened like every day. It was, it was infuriating. GT area is safe. Oh,

596
02:17:31,930 --> 02:17:45,860
oh no. Don't get your ice cream on me. He's a crypto trader Redditor. I'm going to,

597
02:17:45,860 --> 02:17:55,340
I want to keep the melee. I like this team. Cooperate with Kakarou to retake Serenity Street.

598
02:18:01,700 --> 02:18:28,250
There's no reason for this. There's no reason for this. It's because of the face cam. I mean,

599
02:18:28,250 --> 02:18:35,270
he's all right. How did I miss all those? What the fuck? How did I miss them all?

600
02:18:41,719 --> 02:18:52,010
This is pretty good actually. You can land it. How did you dodge all those?

601
02:19:04,360 --> 02:19:31,639
Got him. Is that my ally? This will be good. Big thick beams. There they go.

602
02:19:42,700 --> 02:20:10,889
It can't go any lower. It can't go any lower. I don't have clothes on. I can't. What do you

603
02:20:10,889 --> 02:20:37,940
guys not know about terms of service? You're not allowed to be naked. Don't let him come over here.

604
02:20:37,940 --> 02:21:08,040
Shoot him. No, I did it. You were there. Good shot. Sack. Sack. Sack. The guy didn't stand a

605
02:21:08,040 --> 02:21:43,559
chance. This tank is so good. He's left. Tank is so good. We're at all time lows here. Shit. Got it.

606
02:21:44,739 --> 02:22:06,549
No. Okay. I've had enough of your bullshit. Let's get found. Fucking melee. Fucking melee is not

607
02:22:06,549 --> 02:22:28,540
working here. There's just missiles surrounding me. Where am I? Dead. I'm dead too. Pick it up.

608
02:22:28,540 --> 02:22:44,870
Where is it? Get it. Did I not hit you? Get the hell out of here. Big guy. Probably one of the

609
02:22:44,870 --> 02:22:55,340
last things left. Damn it. Just enough. I just need a little bit more and I can throw as many

610
02:22:55,340 --> 02:23:13,659
as I want. We're going off the chart. Oh shit. Careful. What does that mean? What is that?

611
02:23:14,299 --> 02:23:40,809
Who cares? Don't get scared. Just kill him. I need my helmet. Give me one. No.

612
02:23:53,129 --> 02:24:39,540
You fucking asshole. Do something. Do something. Help me. All right. No, no. Don't turn it on yet.

613
02:24:43,020 --> 02:26:57,739
I'm going to go pee. I'll be right back. What do we got? Okay.

614
02:26:58,299 --> 02:28:57,829
Okay. Base cam. Sell. No, we don't. Buy it. I think it's broken. I think. Hello. I think

615
02:28:57,829 --> 02:30:06,579
my pretend funny stock tag is broken. Hold on. Let me reload it. Here we go. Let's play. Crystal.

616
02:30:06,579 --> 02:30:18,440
What's in the crystal? Ooh. That's the guy that shoots the huge beam. Plus two. Dunky donut.

617
02:30:20,170 --> 02:30:37,459
All right. Another data crystal. What is it? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay. You

618
02:30:37,459 --> 02:30:43,850
know when your hair is so bad that this is solid. I was trying to run my hands through my hair.

619
02:30:43,850 --> 02:30:56,979
I tried. What the fuck? I can't. It hurts. Look at how much there is in just the worst places.

620
02:30:57,959 --> 02:31:05,340
This hair just in places that it shouldn't be. It's just everywhere. Like it's all back here.

621
02:31:05,340 --> 02:31:35,190
It's just all back there. Get a haircut, please. I can't.

622
02:31:37,270 --> 02:31:43,989
Do you? Um, excuse me. Are you? Do you? Wait. I can't really. I can't go anywhere.

623
02:31:44,549 --> 02:31:54,329
Do it yourself. I'll mess it up. Could it look any worse than this though? I don't know.

624
02:31:58,969 --> 02:32:12,040
Just shave it. What if I just do like a big fucking big ponytail up here? No,

625
02:32:12,040 --> 02:32:16,920
I can't even do a ponytail. It's too long back here. And it's too short up here.

626
02:32:24,440 --> 02:32:59,319
How would that look? It's so funny how you can go from. Oh, check me out. Just look at it.

627
02:33:00,440 --> 02:33:07,780
I have like a second head that's back here. If I would have like moved this.

628
02:33:09,350 --> 02:33:12,870
I have so much mass back here that there's probably like a face that's just like

629
02:33:14,229 --> 02:33:18,549
sticking out its mouth and its eyes and shit. Like I'm hiding another like head under here.

630
02:33:23,979 --> 02:33:30,200
Too much hair in the back. That's. Don't do spoilers for movies and TV shows, please.

631
02:33:35,500 --> 02:33:39,989
I know. Look, this is the worst I'm ever going to look. So who cares? All right. This is like

632
02:33:39,989 --> 02:34:01,850
the worst I will look. By the way, Darth Vader playing a fucking piano. All right. Goodbye.

633
02:34:02,409 --> 02:34:15,290
All right. We have recovered. Thanks for having fun. Hey Vito, our town is a total mess.

634
02:34:15,930 --> 02:34:26,340
Did somebody say I wonder what his hair smells like? Or am I just making that up because I saw

635
02:34:26,340 --> 02:34:44,280
I wonder what his hair and then adding the rest. I'll squash all you bug. No, I said that. I know

636
02:34:44,280 --> 02:34:51,690
that's what I'm saying. One got it. Ooh. And they even got a new camp. Oh, fixed cameras,

637
02:34:51,690 --> 02:35:10,520
fixed camera and go stupid. This character is actually really good. Why are you getting

638
02:35:10,520 --> 02:35:21,059
this close to me? You know what my skill set is. Okay. I tried it a lot. I have a plane.

639
02:35:25,129 --> 02:35:41,979
Holy shit. I just instantly died. Oh, it's because these tanks got to go. Oh, man. Shit.

640
02:35:42,700 --> 02:36:03,899
I got to get in there to that tank. He's going to just do that super beam and pull up and pull

641
02:36:03,899 --> 02:36:16,520
them in and pull them in and get them in. It does a lot of damage if I can hit the damn thing.

642
02:36:17,319 --> 02:36:57,829
Yeah, I agree. He's annoying, annoying brat. Holy shit. That went far. That's him. You're hitting

643
02:36:57,829 --> 02:37:03,750
me. It's hitting me. He's so dumb. I don't want to be on the same team as him anymore.

644
02:37:04,389 --> 02:37:33,979
All right. Let's clean this up. Please clean it up. You could please. Who's left? See you later.

645
02:37:38,889 --> 02:38:02,069
Making noises. Hey, it's me. I have turbo. I do noise. Can I please run away? Handling. Don't

646
02:38:02,069 --> 02:38:25,319
fall for it. It was a one hit kill. This character is I think probably the most consistently just

647
02:38:25,319 --> 02:38:33,319
good. It's just so good at everything. That's why him and I click so well together. You know?

648
02:38:47,670 --> 02:39:14,229
Come on. Really? This chart turned the face cam off all of a sudden. Oh, we got. I want another

649
02:39:14,229 --> 02:39:31,399
command girl. This is like the fourth spinner girl. Ask and you shall receive another one.

650
02:39:40,440 --> 02:40:00,309
Yes. Well, I'm the coolest. You're such a loser. You are such a loser. I want to try this new tank.

651
02:40:01,030 --> 02:40:16,229
Okay. Now, um, I want to command girls. I'm over by a lot. You're cool, but you've got to go

652
02:40:19,020 --> 02:40:28,819
over by 150. What was my level three? Okay. You go first by 180. Do I have anybody that's 180?

653
02:40:31,690 --> 02:40:46,809
No, I don't. I think one cooperate with the UG to retake the pit. Where are they? Wait,

654
02:40:46,809 --> 02:40:53,879
didn't they say? Where are the adults? Didn't they say the adults were here now? Where are the adults?

655
02:41:00,889 --> 02:41:12,709
They're dead. Huh? Yeah. Keep that shit over there. I don't want to get out of here with that.

656
02:41:12,709 --> 02:41:33,899
I hate when they kept you in that junk. That was a nice shot. Oh, you got keen on what I was doing.

657
02:41:42,440 --> 02:41:50,760
5300 points. Holy. Come on, man. A lot. My crew is only worth like a thousand or like 1800.

658
02:41:57,180 --> 02:42:01,209
What was that? Did we just get like, did we just get a?

659
02:42:06,139 --> 02:42:20,520
What was it? Is it? Is it? Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. I'll get it. What's the one that goes, um,

660
02:42:23,239 --> 02:42:28,389
how does that one go? Can I give it to me phonetically?

661
02:42:37,370 --> 02:42:46,940
Some, that's some, that's some, my cake, that's some, that's a mock, that's a mock,

662
02:42:46,940 --> 02:42:59,299
kicks up. What is it? That's my thoughts, I think. He's trying. I, when I say it, when I go,

663
02:42:59,299 --> 02:43:04,979
let's start to, to look at that sounds more than when it's touch my spin, but it can, I can't say

664
02:43:04,979 --> 02:43:29,989
it. Say it. Atsuma, NA education. Sorry. I didn't learn Japanese. Is it Japanese? I'm just going to

665
02:43:29,989 --> 02:43:49,270
hold on. Ken spin move. Tatsu, Tatsumaki, Tatsumaki, the Tatsumaki. What is the Rio spinning

666
02:43:49,270 --> 02:44:15,500
kit called? Sen, Senpu, Senpuku, Atsumaki Senpuyo. I can't hold on. I need to, I gotta hear it.

667
02:44:20,059 --> 02:44:27,899
To me, it's in my head. Cannon. It's that. Let's see it.

668
02:44:37,129 --> 02:44:38,170
That's tight. Good. Good. Good.

669
02:44:48,280 --> 02:44:55,770
See that's tight. Good. Good. Good. That's tight. Good. Good.

670
02:44:56,250 --> 02:45:11,129
Good. I got, I'm close off rope. Cringe. What is that? Is that what he's, what is the top

671
02:45:13,370 --> 02:45:18,329
That's not even what you said. I just, that's what I thought it said.

672
02:45:19,780 --> 02:45:24,659
Top. Oh, wow. Dude. That's something. That's some top rope. Cringe. That's a top rope.

673
02:45:24,659 --> 02:45:40,629
Elbow drop. Cringe, dude. That's a fringe off the top rope. People's elbow. Cringe, man.

674
02:45:41,350 --> 02:46:15,459
Why is it so laggy? Oh, this is the new car. Too much lag. I can't even see. Fire. Fire. Flame.

675
02:46:16,020 --> 02:46:34,299
Fire. What is it? It's another one. Oh yeah. It goes yoga. Flame. Yoga. Fire. Yoga. Yoga.

676
02:46:34,299 --> 02:46:40,600
Yoga. Flame. Yoga. Fire. Yoga. Fire. Yoga. I remember that's the only thing I could hear.

677
02:46:40,600 --> 02:47:16,809
These people just spam it. Almond or cringe. Or are you sure it's not? I think I like this

678
02:47:16,809 --> 02:47:29,299
tank better than the other tank. I'd love to get another one of these. I want one of the big guys.

679
02:47:30,180 --> 02:47:33,780
These dudes. They run around. They have all these super plasma moves. A double grab.

680
02:47:35,079 --> 02:47:52,100
Bullshit. Link. Link. I'm in the, I'm in the middle of something. I'm kind of in the middle

681
02:47:52,100 --> 02:48:25,430
of something. I agree. The bigger they are, the harder they fall. I finally got to hear it.

682
02:48:27,020 --> 02:48:51,750
We've been waiting for that for three days. Well, that was dumb. Come on. Hold this through.

683
02:48:52,309 --> 02:48:58,229
This dude's fucking all over the place. Holy shit. I need to just relax and.

684
02:49:04,620 --> 02:49:09,940
Wow. You can't even dodge. How are you supposed to dodge that? You can't even dodge this shit.

685
02:49:16,299 --> 02:49:28,309
Got it. Okay. What is it? What are we looking at here? Cool.

686
02:49:43,030 --> 02:50:40,659
Oh, I drew me. What do we get? Barrier Girl and Super Frog. I have two of these.

687
02:50:40,739 --> 02:51:02,920
How many do I need? Let's see. What is Barrier Girl? 500. Whoa. Actually pretty good. Charge

688
02:51:02,920 --> 02:51:09,829
gun, beam yo-yo, charge shot, and barrier. Barrier Girl was trained as a secret agent

689
02:51:09,829 --> 02:51:15,110
as well as her weapons. She also possesses a barrier generator. Use her when you need brute

690
02:51:15,110 --> 02:51:26,500
force. Most expensive character in the game besides G Red. All right. Let's try. I don't

691
02:51:26,500 --> 02:51:42,979
really like this thing. Speaking of G Red, let's get him back in here. Co-operate to retake his

692
02:51:42,979 --> 02:52:06,500
home. I gotta shrink this a little bit. It's blocking my view. All right. Barrier Girl. Let's

693
02:52:06,500 --> 02:52:22,899
see if you're worth the 500 battery power. The charge shot. I don't know if that hits. It's

694
02:52:22,899 --> 02:52:42,229
probably pretty good. All right. What is the barrier? Wait, am I invincible? It kind of.

695
02:52:43,590 --> 02:52:49,340
I'm not sure it's the greatest thing in the world. 500.

696
02:53:05,750 --> 02:53:14,940
Oh, it's you. This is a Jeep thing. I want one of these. This thing can just peel out. That

697
02:53:14,940 --> 02:53:47,129
thing's awesome. New car. Maybe I'll get it. Kill, kill, kill. Kill, kill, kill, kill.

698
02:53:50,620 --> 02:54:14,329
Ow. All right. That ship has got to go. It's a pain in the ass. You know what to do. Just

699
02:54:14,329 --> 02:54:32,020
shit out. Long range. I'll go unboxing waiting room. Nice. I wonder what he's going to get this

700
02:54:32,020 --> 02:55:11,290
time. There it goes. Jeep versus tank. We all know who wins this. It would have been stay back. I

701
02:55:11,290 --> 02:55:28,459
octane vehicle combat. Yeah, kind of. Does every encounter play the same song? Yes, it does. Yes,

702
02:55:28,459 --> 02:55:33,899
it does. I know. And people probably just. I'm going to turn the music off. It's kind of getting

703
02:55:33,899 --> 02:56:02,739
in my head too. And I have, well, we'll play some other song. Simpson's hit and run doom,

704
02:56:02,739 --> 02:56:11,770
eternal OST. Is that, I, but I need to, okay. Doom, eternal OST. I'm going to skip to halfway

705
02:56:11,770 --> 02:56:35,000
through it. How's that? Just play the America's funniest home videos theme song over and over

706
02:56:35,000 --> 02:57:05,049
again. Okay. Is there like a, how long has there like a 10 hour version of this?

707
02:57:16,680 --> 02:57:29,209
Well, here's all of them. Here's every single one. We can, we can. Okay. Let's judge

708
02:57:29,209 --> 02:57:38,219
these. Cause this is, this is an eight minutes video. I can't turn the sound off all the way.

709
02:57:38,219 --> 02:57:55,579
I'm going to go down to, no, I can't. I have to just, I have to just turn off the audio coming

710
02:57:55,579 --> 02:58:10,870
through to crank AFV. All right. I'm just going to mute it. Okay. Let's, let's critique each

711
02:58:10,870 --> 02:58:36,940
America's funniest home videos. I can't. Okay. This one just, the audio quality just sucks.

712
02:58:36,940 --> 02:58:48,809
Okay. Let's go. Let's, let's, here we go. Let's get back to the game. This is the first one.

713
02:58:59,379 --> 02:59:23,850
Nah. Bad. Now bench it. This is recorded with a phone. Nope. Not very good. No. Why, why does

714
02:59:23,850 --> 02:59:28,170
this have a laugh track? Well, it's because they used to show clips of people like falling down

715
02:59:28,170 --> 02:59:45,100
stairs. This is long. It's going to, I'm going to be too late. I can't sing along.

716
02:59:45,899 --> 03:00:09,829
Did they keep the same singer the whole time? Okay. That was that one. This is, here we go.

717
03:00:09,829 --> 03:00:16,389
Wow.

718
03:00:19,909 --> 03:00:22,149
I've missed this show. It's still on TV.

719
03:00:25,079 --> 03:00:28,120
I feel like Vine and TikTok took this over.

720
03:00:32,489 --> 03:00:35,610
America's funniest home videos is now just every Vine you've ever watched.

721
03:00:36,329 --> 03:00:47,670
You might be a star tonight. How many Vines and TikToks exist of like somebody falling down or

722
03:00:47,670 --> 03:00:53,030
like breaking something or like trying to do one thing and then something horrible happens.

723
03:00:53,030 --> 03:01:08,920
It's like, oh, I just dropped it. What am I fighting though? Use barrier. It's snacks.

724
03:01:14,680 --> 03:01:25,290
Stacks. Don't wait. I'm, it's still going. It's too much power. This is too much power.

725
03:01:26,010 --> 03:01:34,760
Nothing. Look at that. I'm dead. They're like five times.

726
03:01:35,639 --> 03:01:54,180
Yeah. Okay. Now we're getting into like the 2000. No, no, that's too much change.

727
03:01:55,059 --> 03:02:07,670
Too much change. How many cartoon sounds do you look?

728
03:02:24,299 --> 03:02:30,379
I, yeah, I got it. I caught it. I caught it. I don't even know what it means, but I just,

729
03:02:30,459 --> 03:02:50,700
they're like sounds. I don't know what it means. Okay. This is the lag character. I don't want to,

730
03:02:50,700 --> 03:03:17,670
she's good, but laggy. Tempo change to, what are you thinking? Is the game, wait,

731
03:03:17,670 --> 03:03:30,629
is this slowing down with the game? Why is this video tied to my frame rate on the GameCube?

732
03:03:30,629 --> 03:03:41,239
This is actually freaking me the fuck out. I hate this.

733
03:04:01,049 --> 03:04:13,750
Funny things you do. This is you. All right. Well, the last, this one's bad.

734
03:04:14,389 --> 03:04:29,100
It's from like 1998 or something. 1997. Eh, not good. Okay. No, I don't like this one. No,

735
03:04:29,100 --> 03:04:32,739
no, no, no, no, no. I don't like this one either. I feel like it was,

736
03:04:49,059 --> 03:04:56,340
had to knock on wood, but I'm not someone who has, they made me want to read back to it.

737
03:04:56,340 --> 03:05:09,110
Yeah. Is this the same song? America, this is you. Did they say that at the end?

738
03:05:09,909 --> 03:05:35,000
For the Buddy Buddy Boston song? Wait, there's a mashup out of those two songs.

739
03:05:35,000 --> 03:06:09,030
This is actually, I told you. This is a good song.

740
03:06:14,629 --> 03:06:44,600
The best part about the mighty, mighty Boston, there were like 200 people in this band.

741
03:06:49,819 --> 03:06:58,889
I owned this CD. I owned that CD. I used to listen to this on repeat. They're a great band.

742
03:07:02,459 --> 03:07:10,739
Play the actual song. Is it going to get, I'm not getting in trouble with this.

743
03:07:11,379 --> 03:07:26,489
It's going to be the VOD. VOD's already gone because you just played four

744
03:07:26,489 --> 03:07:30,250
America's Funniest Home videos. I want to hear it. It's been a long time.

745
03:07:30,250 --> 03:07:35,620
This song is all right. Whatever. It's worth it. I love this song. It's a fucking awesome song.

746
03:07:36,500 --> 03:07:44,870
Let's, let's fucking jam to this for a little bit. It's like, there was,

747
03:07:44,870 --> 03:08:00,870
yeah, there's a ton of people in this band. Sick. This is genuinely my wedding song.

748
03:08:03,059 --> 03:08:34,780
I mean, that's great. That's a really good song. A lot behind these lyrics.

749
03:08:41,540 --> 03:08:47,670
All right. All right. Don't, don't, don't claim this video. I just want to hear it for a second.

750
03:08:47,670 --> 03:08:57,370
All right. Now back to the, back to the other one. You can't claim this. This is the different song.

751
03:09:05,940 --> 03:09:18,860
Nice. What's the next one? This one's epic. Dude, this one's epic.

752
03:09:19,260 --> 03:10:20,629
Which one is this? Persona battle music. It's the same again. Yeah. Wait. This is good.

753
03:10:21,590 --> 03:10:26,709
This is good thinking music, but when the family has to come up with a final answer

754
03:10:26,709 --> 03:10:28,549
and they're scrambling around trying to figure it out.

755
03:10:50,069 --> 03:11:14,520
Double dragon. What is this? I just got smoked. Oh, that was fun. Okay. This song is fucking awful.

756
03:11:14,520 --> 03:11:21,479
Why? Why do you hate it? Do this one now, now, now, now, now, now, now.

757
03:11:33,020 --> 03:12:07,670
Superman. Wait, this is also the same one. Oh shit. This is sick. Okay. Dude, you know,

758
03:12:07,670 --> 03:12:12,629
why wouldn't, okay. Imagine if you had these two musicians, if you, why, why does this not exist

759
03:12:12,629 --> 03:12:16,629
some company that's just like, let's just mash up songs and like just split it 50 who you wanted

760
03:12:16,629 --> 03:12:22,340
to just get 50 50. Just put this album up, put up like a mashup album and just get permission and

761
03:12:22,340 --> 03:12:59,959
give them 50 50. People love this shit. I'm not matched up. I know. I don't care. I'm matched up

762
03:12:59,959 --> 03:13:17,940
in my brain and in my living room, but not on your screen. Okay. Don't claim the bond. What's

763
03:13:17,940 --> 03:13:39,700
another one? What dragon can fight a tank? None. Put it back on. No, we're all going to get in

764
03:13:39,700 --> 03:13:58,440
trouble. What's this one? Uh, no, I don't want to listen to Pokemon music, but you, you wrote ass

765
03:13:58,440 --> 03:14:04,489
next to this one. So let's see what this is. Oh, I don't know. I don't know what this is. No.

766
03:14:05,850 --> 03:14:33,620
Um, this one's called, this one's just called penis music. Wait, this is the, somebody made a

767
03:14:33,620 --> 03:14:38,899
video with me doing this with like the people behind the, like into like the restaurant kitchen.

768
03:14:39,700 --> 03:15:02,040
That's what it's from. That's the meme. This is, this is it. This is the meme. Who are,

769
03:15:02,040 --> 03:15:10,809
who are these characters supposed to be? Are these from like a cartoon or like a kid's show or

770
03:15:10,809 --> 03:15:25,610
something? They're from Megamind. Oh, all right. Well, cool. I get it. I guess. What's this one?

771
03:15:25,610 --> 03:15:47,540
Remember when Jerma spoiled Megamind? I did. Uh, all right now. All right. All right. All right.

772
03:15:47,540 --> 03:16:03,860
I'm going to, let's put on a Yoshi's story. OST. What's this? You don't want to put on

773
03:16:03,860 --> 03:16:38,709
Yoshi's story. OST. Wario land music. Wario land four. Hurry up. Okay. I'll try it. Nah,

774
03:16:38,709 --> 03:16:56,229
fuck that. I know what we're doing. Oh, fuck that. I know what we're doing.

775
03:16:58,389 --> 03:17:18,139
It's the Neverhood OST. One of the best OSTs ever. Terry Scott Taylor. This shit,

776
03:17:18,139 --> 03:17:22,540
fuck, this shit is just pops up and down, left and right, every which way.

777
03:17:24,059 --> 03:17:42,540
Defeat the Cotcher Borg. Hey, there's a little penis music part here for you.

778
03:17:43,579 --> 03:18:10,219
Holy shit. Pog. When am I going to stream the Neverhood? I streamed Army Crog.

779
03:18:13,379 --> 03:18:23,659
Nothing can compare. If I can get it to work, I would. It's so, you guys would love this shit.

780
03:18:23,659 --> 03:18:29,340
You guys, I can't believe that like Twitch has not been, a lot of you guys don't even know. You

781
03:18:29,340 --> 03:18:40,010
guys would love it. It would be like your favorite thing. I'm doing it. I'll find a way. There's one

782
03:18:40,010 --> 03:18:45,370
part that just pops up and you need like a save file to patch over it. I don't even know if that

783
03:18:46,010 --> 03:19:08,069
file exists anymore. It's my favorite game ever made. Yeah, it has to be. It has to take number

784
03:19:08,069 --> 03:19:32,120
one. It has to. Ask Vinny, he did? Really? Still ask him what he did. Terry Scott Taylor also did

785
03:19:32,120 --> 03:19:38,969
the soundtrack for Army Crog, but unfortunately, it was a lot of just kind of background.

786
03:19:40,010 --> 03:19:44,090
Didn't really sing on it. It was, I think there's only one track that he actually sang on and his

787
03:19:44,090 --> 03:19:52,069
lyrics are just like this. It's just kind of gibberish. It's great. There's a few tracks on

788
03:19:52,069 --> 03:20:16,950
Army Crog that are awesome. I mean, not like this, like listen. Where's that? We'll go back to this.

789
03:20:17,510 --> 03:20:22,790
Where's the Terry Scott Taylor demo for Army Crog? When he's talking about going pee pee in his pants.

790
03:20:22,790 --> 03:20:26,790
You guys would love this guy. I'm serious. I can't believe nobody likes this. I can't believe nobody

791
03:20:26,790 --> 03:20:46,889
loves this guy. Here it is. Let's listen to it. You guys are going to love this song.

792
03:20:46,889 --> 03:20:50,600
This is from the Army Crog demo.

793
03:23:19,209 --> 03:23:33,139
There it is. Yeah, that's Terry Scott Taylor. We can go back to the Neverhood soundtrack.

794
03:23:33,139 --> 03:23:34,819
If you like that, there's way more on the way.

795
03:23:37,959 --> 03:23:41,239
It was kind of loud. I'm sorry. I just like burped in your ear.

796
03:24:15,799 --> 03:24:19,559
You'll need this game forever. Don't worry. You're never going to see it again after today.

797
03:24:22,520 --> 03:24:40,870
Never play. What's going on? Relax. All right. You guys have to guess my favorite song in this album.

798
03:24:51,639 --> 03:24:52,600
Spoiler. This is one of them.

799
03:24:53,239 --> 03:25:59,799
Oh, fuck. That's a big dragon. I love this. This just turned into a listen party.

800
03:26:03,750 --> 03:26:32,250
This is also a good one. He just coughed. Oh, that was such a good shot.

801
03:26:33,209 --> 03:27:33,030
Don't die to this. I'm dying with this music on. I'm not going to fuck this soundtrack as a kid.

802
03:27:33,030 --> 03:27:45,530
Hey, that makes two of us. I have the Imaginarium soundtrack, which is all of it. It's behind me.

803
03:27:45,530 --> 03:28:18,100
I displayed it on my Reddit shelf. We're going to do, I think I've played this one before, but

804
03:28:18,659 --> 03:28:25,239
this is from Skull Monkeys. When you went into a bonus room, this is what played.

805
03:28:25,239 --> 03:28:32,659
If you went into a secret area, this is what would play. It's just great.

806
03:28:58,469 --> 03:29:08,629
You can linger because I'm your video friend. Think of me as a father figure with a hand to land.

807
03:29:09,670 --> 03:29:14,389
Here's a little bonus room where you don't have to worry.

808
03:29:15,430 --> 03:29:22,709
Take your sweet time. You need not hurry. Oh, you're looking incredible.

809
03:29:23,510 --> 03:29:31,110
You're the bomb and me. I'm kind of like your dad and a little like your mom.

810
03:29:32,389 --> 03:29:37,430
There are no monsters here. Hey, wait, look over there.

811
03:29:40,229 --> 03:29:51,350
I was just kidding. Don't be scared. And when you turn this game off in the real world once again,

812
03:29:51,350 --> 03:30:01,030
you won't have to play, make me leave or try to pretend because I'll be right there when you

813
03:30:01,030 --> 03:30:12,629
open your hand because I'm your little invisible musical friend. So show me to your pets or show

814
03:30:12,629 --> 03:30:22,389
me to your pals. You really will impress every nifty guy and gal. Show them you're individual.

815
03:30:23,270 --> 03:30:33,829
Show them you are bold. Besides, I get residuals for every game that's sold. I'm your little

816
03:30:34,549 --> 03:30:38,870
invisible musical friend.

817
03:30:46,620 --> 03:30:58,549
For life. Hey, speaking of Skullmonkeys, why don't we just get on with the Skullmonkeys theme.

818
03:30:58,549 --> 03:31:00,950
That was the sequel to The Neverhood. Didn't sell very well.

819
03:31:01,510 --> 03:31:03,909
Wasn't it? People weren't really a big fan of it, but you know, whatever.

820
03:31:06,069 --> 03:31:24,059
Boringly gameplay. I think I'm doing pretty well considering it.

821
03:31:24,940 --> 03:31:40,579
Somebody said we're listening to bad music. Um, careful here. You are referencing probably,

822
03:31:41,139 --> 03:31:49,579
probably the number one, my most favorite thing on earth is this series. So I would be careful

823
03:31:49,579 --> 03:31:54,680
here. You're talking, this is like literally one or two of my favorite thing that's ever been made.

824
03:31:54,680 --> 03:32:11,579
Okay. Just want to make sure we're clear. Be careful here. Be careful. Wait, what was I playing?

825
03:32:11,579 --> 03:32:32,709
Let's do this one. Wait, where is it? Did I X the window out? Did we listen to this one yet?

826
03:32:32,709 --> 03:32:57,239
Did we listen to this one? Slapper. This one's a classic. Yeah, this one's a fucking classic.

827
03:32:59,079 --> 03:33:09,030
This is the first thing you hear in the game. That's right. This is the first song you hear

828
03:33:09,030 --> 03:33:14,649
in the game. You wake up. There's no fucking tutorial in this game. You just wake up,

829
03:33:14,649 --> 03:33:19,350
this music's not playing. You got to figure out what the hell you're doing. What the fuck?

830
03:33:19,350 --> 03:33:30,299
What a 10 out of 10 game. I'm not talking about this game. This game's a three out of 10,

831
03:33:30,299 --> 03:33:46,360
according to fucking publications at the time, which that's wrong too. Played Neverhood. I will.

832
03:33:46,360 --> 03:33:52,520
I will. I will. I will. I promise. I will. I can't play Armor Crog on launch and then be like,

833
03:33:52,520 --> 03:33:55,719
Neverhood, yeah, it's a good one. It's my favorite thing ever made, but maybe one day.

834
03:33:56,760 --> 03:34:41,420
$150, three out of 10 game to read all the Neverhood lore. The game was just a huge,

835
03:34:41,420 --> 03:34:47,020
there's this huge fuck you in this game. I don't want to give spoilers for it, but it's so fucking

836
03:34:47,020 --> 03:34:53,670
stupid. It's like the worst, like just fuck you. You guys know what I'm talking about.

837
03:34:54,309 --> 03:35:00,620
Hold on, pause it. Those of you that played the Neverhood, I don't, don't give it away because

838
03:35:00,620 --> 03:35:06,790
we're going to have to, we'll see it eventually. But there is a massive, massive tedious thing that

839
03:35:06,790 --> 03:35:13,270
you have to do or you cannot complete the game. And it takes, I think like at least 15 to 20

840
03:35:13,270 --> 03:35:23,290
straight minutes of doing this wicked, boring, shitty thing. Oh, like the game you're playing

841
03:35:23,290 --> 03:35:47,129
now. Quiet. Careful here. Careful. I enjoy you, but be careful. You understand? You're talking about

842
03:35:47,129 --> 03:35:54,100
one of my, this is definitely not one of my favorite things ever made. This is probably like

843
03:35:54,100 --> 03:36:10,219
somewhere, yeah, maybe top 100. No, probably like 101. This could be 101. Dude, listen to my gamer

844
03:36:10,219 --> 03:36:20,010
noises. You don't get to hear these when there's no sound. This game sucks. Admit it. Why would I

845
03:36:20,010 --> 03:36:29,879
stream this game for three days in a row if I thought it sucked? Why would I do that to bite

846
03:36:29,879 --> 03:36:50,889
you? I actually think we're probably getting close to the end. Why does chat hate this game?

847
03:36:51,530 --> 03:36:59,319
I don't think they do. I think it's, I think it's like, I don't think it's very, I think it's only

848
03:36:59,319 --> 03:37:13,219
like a few people. I think, I don't think it's true. I think people think this is sick. I'm

849
03:37:13,219 --> 03:37:16,340
going to keep the flying saucer though. That's good. I do think we're getting close to the end

850
03:37:16,340 --> 03:37:20,260
of the game though. And I'm not going to do like new game plus, new game plus, new game plus.

851
03:37:20,260 --> 03:37:25,659
Don't worry. Just enjoying a thing that I like. And I know that a lot of people like it too,

852
03:37:25,659 --> 03:37:35,459
because they've told me I've gotten two or three DMs in the last week. One of which,

853
03:37:36,500 --> 03:37:42,420
hoping to go fuck myself. But the other two were about, this game seems kind of fun. I hope you

854
03:37:42,420 --> 03:37:58,600
keep playing it. So two, yeah, that's enough. Here comes the big battle. Oh, you have a helicopter

855
03:37:58,600 --> 03:38:21,959
note. What about the comedy points? What about it? They look all right. What does that come?

856
03:38:21,959 --> 03:38:28,889
Does it come out of the bottom? Trying to figure out what this thing does. I think it comes out of

857
03:38:28,889 --> 03:38:52,280
the bottom. This thing's really good. Holy shit. That was an instant kill. Whoa. Actually, I don't

858
03:38:52,280 --> 03:39:10,739
like it. I don't like that thing getting replaced. It's too expensive. Swim down? What do you mean

859
03:39:10,739 --> 03:39:44,340
swim down? Just swim down, man. Yeah, just stand still and spam. It works. So is there like a

860
03:39:44,340 --> 03:39:51,379
Patapon bundle on PlayStation 4? Or is it just the first one that's available? And is it a scenario

861
03:39:51,379 --> 03:39:59,979
where Patapon 2 is just Patapon 1 but better? Kind of like the Pikmin games. Does it matter?

862
03:40:00,700 --> 03:40:18,280
Yeah, Patapon 2 is so much better. Patapon 2 is a straight upgrade. But holy shit, look at this tank.

863
03:40:19,399 --> 03:40:33,690
What is this? I think this is a bug. I don't think that's supposed to be like that. Patapon 3 sucks.

864
03:40:34,250 --> 03:40:39,670
So should I just, should I play Patapon 2? Or should I start at Patapon 1?

865
03:40:50,090 --> 03:41:07,020
2 is really good. Play minus 2. Don't play any video games. 2 is just one but better.

866
03:41:11,399 --> 03:41:24,250
Ooh, Atra Witch. You win, Jerma? What is this? An unofficial poll? That doesn't mean anything.

867
03:41:26,920 --> 03:41:31,399
Gotcha Man. I don't care. I like his voice. I love Gotcha Force. I hate Gotcha Force.

868
03:41:34,979 --> 03:41:45,930
So 26% of people, whatever. Play 2, then 1, then replay 2. What are you talking about?

869
03:41:53,100 --> 03:41:57,260
I'm getting rid of the saucer. It's too much money and it's too hard to use. What do you do?

870
03:41:59,620 --> 03:42:07,770
Oh, pretty weak. Stick it in large. Wait, that's what that is. Big spell.

871
03:42:08,569 --> 03:42:23,100
We could magnify others with the big spell. I have to try it. 480 left. Get rid of you.

872
03:42:23,979 --> 03:42:30,329
Where's the knight that I like here? This guy. Ah, 540. Fuck. 370. Here we are.

873
03:42:30,889 --> 03:42:49,379
Let's love 260. Where's Command Girl? Command Girl, where are you? Level 1. No, I have a level 2.

874
03:42:51,219 --> 03:43:08,760
It's a fucking mess. There we go. Uh, you. No, shit. Um, you. No, you're too much too.

875
03:43:08,760 --> 03:43:33,450
Who's 2? Any like a 280? A great dragon parade. These are getting more and more intense.

876
03:43:33,450 --> 03:43:41,940
Remember when this was organized? Yeah. Please vote. Your vote counts. Is this a different poll?

877
03:43:41,940 --> 03:44:15,579
Okay. Big. It's huge. Go get him. Bro. Can I, does it stack? Did I just make him bigger?

878
03:44:17,879 --> 03:44:28,729
Uh, all right. Well, what was that? Somebody just dropped a bunch of pots and pans over here.

879
03:44:35,500 --> 03:44:43,239
You're too big. That's. Wait, how many? This is 8,000 points. Oh my God. This is going to be

880
03:44:43,319 --> 03:45:04,600
a pain in the ass. I'll just use it. Come on. Spawn. This can take forever.

881
03:45:12,809 --> 03:45:18,920
How many dragons are there? Each one's a thousand. So there's probably seven more.

882
03:45:31,879 --> 03:45:47,739
Oh, come on. I just got caught in a double beam. That sucked. Land already. Oh, helicopter doing

883
03:45:47,739 --> 03:46:05,100
work. What's going on? His face on the wall. That was funny. Don't get killed. Okay. Here we go.

884
03:46:05,819 --> 03:46:38,659
What a pain in the ass. This is all dragons. At least they're huge targets with my tank.

885
03:46:46,090 --> 03:47:05,219
Oops. All dragon. What's that from? What is that? Captain crunch.

886
03:47:09,860 --> 03:47:23,479
Oops. Oh, very. That's, that's funny. What a fake captain crunch fan.

887
03:47:24,459 --> 03:47:29,100
I like original captain crunch. I don't like, I mean, crunch berries are good, but I don't follow

888
03:47:29,100 --> 03:47:48,920
all their, I don't follow all their changes. What is happening? Fake fan, fake fan. I like

889
03:47:48,920 --> 03:48:13,260
original captain crunch. It makes me a fake fan. Apparently fun. He's at the last three or last.

890
03:48:13,260 --> 03:48:40,469
How many? Three. All right. This is it. Destroy, destroy. That was, this one was a pain in the ass.

891
03:48:57,989 --> 03:49:19,139
Shoot him. All right. Let's end it. All right. That one was long and tedious. All right. What's

892
03:49:19,219 --> 03:49:24,860
the, what's the poll at now? See, I like gotcha force. I don't care. I hate gotcha force. See,

893
03:49:29,819 --> 03:49:37,670
plays a dragon. I'll play as one of the dragons next mission. I promise. Not this one though.

894
03:49:37,670 --> 03:49:51,209
Maybe I will play with the ice dragon who has the most power. Oh, this is a mess. Uh, 10, 50,

895
03:50:01,819 --> 03:50:13,940
240, 210. All right. I can do one of these. Where's, uh, no, it's so unorganized. I hate it.

896
03:50:14,500 --> 03:50:27,100
I'll try the dragon. The sm I thought it said smell battle, the small battle, small, huh?

897
03:50:27,899 --> 03:51:00,389
You sniff battle. Ooh, pretty good. Actually that charges up fast.

898
03:51:08,709 --> 03:51:20,069
Oh, are they getting too close? All right. Fly. Get in there. Get in there. Fly in the air. What

899
03:51:20,069 --> 03:52:18,659
are you doing? Fire. Well, he killed a few people. Oh no. I let out. Oh, Ed.

900
03:52:36,870 --> 03:53:01,319
Okay. That, that, wow. What an easy level for late game. I love it. Finally. It only took

901
03:53:01,399 --> 03:53:28,170
15 hours of playing this game to get the powered gunman. Whatever that is. Are you getting tired

902
03:53:28,170 --> 03:53:34,819
of lettuce, lettuce and tomato hamburgers in this town? You forgot the most important part.

903
03:53:34,819 --> 03:53:48,540
That don't quite make it. Yeah. Double shot. Punch kick. Powered shot. Powered long shot.

904
03:53:48,540 --> 03:54:09,659
Let's try it. What are you 380? Ah, we'll do, uh, we'll do, uh, copy paper in the beginning.

905
03:54:15,719 --> 03:54:22,600
But hot, hot. Keep it cool. Cool. Defeat the girl Borg unit or defeat the machine Borg unit

906
03:54:23,319 --> 03:54:36,170
or showdown hero Borg unit. Let's do this one. Wait, save the game. DLT, McDLT, hot beefy McD,

907
03:54:36,170 --> 03:54:58,309
cool crisp LT, new McDLT, the new McDLT. Look, I can do better. What rock? All right. Let's copy

908
03:54:58,309 --> 03:55:27,180
B for somebody. We're going to copy B for this guy. Bro, bro. Oh, first of all, the,

909
03:55:27,180 --> 03:55:37,370
I look at person's fucking Tommy gun. This guy sucked for this scenario. It was bad. All right.

910
03:55:37,370 --> 03:55:52,420
Woody. Oh, it's like a big burst. You get in close with that. He has a double shot. I mean,

911
03:55:52,420 --> 03:55:56,659
it would work if, you know, if I wasn't surrounded by five fucking people, the dragon's going to come

912
03:55:56,659 --> 03:56:03,860
in and just wipe out everybody. I can't wait. All right. Bring out the fucking dragon. Let's go.

913
03:56:14,629 --> 03:56:53,340
Hey, huh? That's shrink. Just run them over already. Shit. This is my last guy.

914
03:56:53,979 --> 03:57:13,239
It's a bad matchup. Thank God. You say you want a burger to be hot and delicious in your lettuce.

915
03:57:13,239 --> 03:57:32,979
No, you got it wrong. Ice cold. She, I didn't even see what that was. Ice cold cheese. I mean,

916
03:57:32,979 --> 03:57:38,579
it's time. What's, what's, what's, what's, what's with this one man spam? What's with this one man

917
03:57:38,579 --> 03:57:52,920
spam? I'm seeing one man spam. Oh, no, don't time that person out. You say you're getting

918
03:57:52,920 --> 03:57:57,879
tired of lettuce and tomato hamburgers in this town that don't quite make it. Yeah. You say that

919
03:57:57,879 --> 03:58:02,840
just once you'd like your hamburger hot and your lettuce and tomato cool and crisp all at the same

920
03:58:02,840 --> 03:58:08,520
time. Yeah. Well, I say you got it. I'm talking McDonald's new lettuce and tomato hamburger,

921
03:58:08,520 --> 03:58:15,159
the McDLT, I'm talking quarter pound of beef on the hot, hot side and the hot stays hot.

922
03:58:15,159 --> 03:58:21,879
The new McDLT, hot, hot, crisp lettuce and tomato on the cool, cool side and the cool stays cool.

923
03:58:21,879 --> 03:58:27,719
The new McDLT, cool, crisp. The beef stays hot, the cool stays crisp. Put it together,

924
03:58:27,719 --> 03:58:33,879
you can't resist. The hottest taste, the coolest dish. Keep it hot, hot, keep it cool, cool.

925
03:58:33,879 --> 03:58:46,360
McDLT. McDLT. McDLT. McDLT. It's a good time for the great taste of McDonald's.

926
03:58:52,120 --> 03:58:59,159
Why am I such a shill from McDonald's? Um, I love McDonald's, it's like my favorite place.

927
03:58:59,159 --> 03:59:11,829
Oh, what's this new guy?

928
03:59:11,829 --> 03:59:13,549
Oh, what's this new guy?

929
03:59:13,549 --> 03:59:34,170
What, he's like a construction bot?

930
03:59:34,170 --> 03:59:35,170
Donald sucks.

931
03:59:35,170 --> 03:59:38,170
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I

932
03:59:38,170 --> 03:59:56,059
hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you.

933
03:59:56,059 --> 03:59:57,059
What's the point of this?

934
03:59:57,059 --> 04:00:03,700
Can I just drop it on his head?

935
04:00:03,700 --> 04:00:04,700
He hates him.

936
04:00:04,700 --> 04:00:09,260
Alright, just kill this guy.

937
04:00:09,260 --> 04:00:13,659
Yeah, you can drop it on their head.

938
04:00:13,659 --> 04:00:18,770
Now we get to actually see how useful this person is.

939
04:00:18,770 --> 04:00:20,610
That shotgun's gotta be real close.

940
04:00:20,850 --> 04:00:27,059
I'm gonna try to get in close to one of these guys.

941
04:00:27,059 --> 04:00:28,059
Like this.

942
04:00:28,059 --> 04:00:29,059
Oh!

943
04:00:29,059 --> 04:00:34,700
Alright, what about the charged long shot?

944
04:00:34,700 --> 04:00:42,750
Holy shit, that looked insane.

945
04:00:42,750 --> 04:00:43,750
That hits.

946
04:00:43,750 --> 04:00:44,989
Ooh, it's very good.

947
04:00:44,989 --> 04:01:00,430
Come on.

948
04:01:00,430 --> 04:01:01,430
It's pretty good.

949
04:01:01,430 --> 04:01:07,899
Nice, hold him in place.

950
04:01:07,899 --> 04:01:09,659
Nope.

951
04:01:09,659 --> 04:01:10,659
Good.

952
04:01:10,659 --> 04:01:12,090
Who's left?

953
04:01:12,090 --> 04:01:13,090
Uh-oh.

954
04:01:13,090 --> 04:01:22,520
My arch!

955
04:01:22,520 --> 04:01:23,520
That bitch is...

956
04:01:23,520 --> 04:01:24,520
I wanna shoot this way.

957
04:01:24,520 --> 04:01:25,520
What are you doing?

958
04:01:25,520 --> 04:01:28,940
Holy fuck, it does hurt a lot.

959
04:01:28,940 --> 04:01:29,940
Shit.

960
04:01:29,940 --> 04:01:39,559
He's so good.

961
04:01:39,559 --> 04:01:40,559
Oh!

962
04:01:45,020 --> 04:01:47,860
Damn it.

963
04:01:47,860 --> 04:01:48,860
Still hit it.

964
04:01:48,860 --> 04:01:49,860
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit.

965
04:01:49,860 --> 04:02:00,639
Oh!

966
04:02:00,639 --> 04:02:01,639
It's okay.

967
04:02:01,639 --> 04:02:16,309
We got our dragon.

968
04:02:16,309 --> 04:02:22,450
Ice dragon's pretty good.

969
04:02:22,450 --> 04:02:29,260
Wait, it's the Israel dragon?

970
04:02:29,260 --> 04:02:30,260
Hold on.

971
04:02:30,260 --> 04:02:41,100
Wait.

972
04:02:41,100 --> 04:02:42,100
What is the...

973
04:02:42,100 --> 04:02:45,319
Uh, I...

974
04:02:45,319 --> 04:02:47,010
Don't get killed.

975
04:02:47,010 --> 04:02:51,899
Attack!

976
04:02:51,899 --> 04:02:58,260
More!

977
04:02:58,260 --> 04:03:01,540
More!

978
04:03:01,540 --> 04:03:07,819
More!

979
04:03:07,819 --> 04:03:08,819
I'll take sugar.

980
04:03:08,819 --> 04:03:09,819
And water.

981
04:03:09,819 --> 04:03:10,819
More.

982
04:03:10,819 --> 04:03:23,379
More, please.

983
04:03:23,420 --> 04:03:24,420
More, please.

984
04:03:24,420 --> 04:03:31,059
You're gonna get in the melee range

985
04:03:31,059 --> 04:03:32,059
with fucking

986
04:03:32,059 --> 04:03:33,059
Dragon?

987
04:03:35,129 --> 04:03:36,129
What a fucking idiot.

988
04:03:36,129 --> 04:03:37,129
What a fucking idiot.

989
04:03:38,129 --> 04:03:39,129
What a fucking idiot.

990
04:03:39,129 --> 04:03:40,129
What a fucking idiot.

991
04:03:40,129 --> 04:03:41,129
What a fucking idiot.

992
04:03:49,979 --> 04:03:52,819
What...

993
04:03:52,819 --> 04:03:53,819
Bro...

994
04:03:53,819 --> 04:03:59,420
What?

995
04:03:59,420 --> 04:04:02,379
What?

996
04:04:02,379 --> 04:04:03,379
I get excited.

997
04:04:03,379 --> 04:04:04,379
I am an excitable person.

998
04:04:04,379 --> 04:04:09,909
You have a problem with that?

999
04:04:09,909 --> 04:04:10,909
Turn off...

1000
04:04:10,909 --> 04:04:11,909
If you've got a problem with that,

1001
04:04:11,909 --> 04:04:12,909
turn off the stream.

1002
04:04:12,909 --> 04:04:14,149
Or what?

1003
04:04:14,149 --> 04:04:25,850
Okay.

1004
04:04:25,850 --> 04:04:26,850
Oh no.

1005
04:04:26,850 --> 04:04:27,850
End up the stream.

1006
04:04:27,850 --> 04:04:28,850
End up the stream, boys.

1007
04:04:28,850 --> 04:04:29,850
No, not yet.

1008
04:04:29,850 --> 04:04:35,579
No, not yet. I want to beat this. I got two of these though. That's good.

1009
04:04:48,909 --> 04:04:51,309
I don't want to- the construction robot's stupid.

1010
04:04:51,870 --> 04:04:56,639
Is this game on Steam that we awesome if it was if they just remade it?

1011
04:04:56,760 --> 04:05:00,440
They added more stuff and made it more- have like multiplier and stuff and balance it.

1012
04:05:01,120 --> 04:05:16,250
I got a data crystal for one of these and then just got one of these. It's like fucking Christmas. I want that guy.

1013
04:05:26,790 --> 04:05:29,030
Gared, I don't like this guy. He's kind of dumb.

1014
04:05:31,840 --> 04:05:40,139
390. No. I do like Woody. I can do a command girl. That's good. I like this team.

1015
04:05:40,659 --> 04:05:49,670
Defeat the girl Borg unit. Ooh

1016
04:05:50,110 --> 04:05:52,909
Huge we have massive air support now

1017
04:06:01,379 --> 04:06:20,000
Come on mirror. I'm so glad I have the huge airplane thing

1018
04:06:20,680 --> 04:06:55,930
They're very fast. Just like I am. Kill the support. Kill the medic. Kill the medic first. I've played games before

1019
04:06:56,770 --> 04:07:17,950
Wake up. I just shotgun to her in the face. Oh my god. That guy didn't even get to spawn. Oh

1020
04:07:36,309 --> 04:07:40,600
No heal. No heals. No heals. Oh

1021
04:07:41,479 --> 04:08:11,120
All healers. Come on. All right, just get in. Nice shot. Hell out here. Oh, he's a- he actually punches. That's cool

1022
04:08:11,799 --> 04:08:25,299
I'm ever gonna do a secret

1023
04:08:25,500 --> 04:09:06,309
EUTF 2 stream. Very dope. Did I hit it? No. Oh you healed you piece of shit. I did some good damage

1024
04:09:06,309 --> 04:09:27,120
I'm good. I did some good damage. Check out the dragon. I gotta land. Step.

1025
04:09:35,659 --> 04:09:45,350
The range. Big mistake. What the hell were you thinking knocking me all the way back here?

1026
04:09:45,870 --> 04:10:05,500
Get it. Just fire. Two huge distractions. This is good

1027
04:10:06,059 --> 04:10:27,420
Ice dragon is so good. This was supposed to be long and difficult, but not with the ice dragon

1028
04:10:27,819 --> 04:10:50,930
Hey, you got a long way to go. Come on over here. Oh, hi. I'm bouncing around too much.

1029
04:10:51,329 --> 04:11:00,030
Log Pyra would destroy you

1030
04:11:01,829 --> 04:11:05,870
Well, that would be assuming that the flog pyro

1031
04:11:06,629 --> 04:11:09,430
Was in the game for more than five minutes without getting vote kicked

1032
04:11:09,989 --> 04:11:36,899
Another wire girl. So many of these random crystals. I don't have

1033
04:11:37,459 --> 04:11:40,549
They don't have all the capabilities to combine them though

1034
04:11:41,030 --> 04:11:56,090
Another one. Damn, okay. What's this one?

1035
04:11:56,370 --> 04:11:58,610
Defeat the wing and angel Borg

1036
04:11:59,049 --> 04:12:01,860
Defeat the diver unit

1037
04:12:03,229 --> 04:12:04,469
training

1038
04:12:04,469 --> 04:12:07,420
Mr. Reverse Bolt

1039
04:12:07,420 --> 04:12:10,579
Defeat the bombing unit

1040
04:12:12,139 --> 04:12:15,180
Cold battle, I think I want to do Mr. Reverse Bolt

1041
04:12:17,190 --> 04:12:25,940
Does this game ever end?

1042
04:12:26,180 --> 04:12:28,340
Yeah, it does. I think we got it. I think so

1043
04:12:31,700 --> 04:12:34,340
I'm not doing a fourth stream. I promise you that

1044
04:12:44,979 --> 04:12:48,260
I do love this game though. I do I just it's fun just to fly around and just like

1045
04:12:50,739 --> 04:12:58,309
The streamer enjoys things how dare he

1046
04:12:59,030 --> 04:13:02,969
He's supposed to talk about how the rays of death at our sucks

1047
04:13:03,690 --> 04:13:24,020
He's not supposed to like this

1048
04:13:24,180 --> 04:13:29,059
What will be your new mouse? I don't know. I only know the death adder. It's the only thing I know

1049
04:13:30,520 --> 04:13:32,440
So I have no idea

1050
04:13:32,440 --> 04:13:34,440
I don't like a shitload of buttons and I don't like

1051
04:13:35,239 --> 04:13:38,120
I don't like it to be all jagged and like metal and shit

1052
04:13:39,000 --> 04:13:47,260
I just like a big palm mouse with two good easily clickable mouse pointers

1053
04:13:47,979 --> 04:13:49,979
and then just two

1054
04:13:50,219 --> 04:13:53,420
Or three big buttons on the side on the thumb side

1055
04:13:55,559 --> 04:13:58,200
Like you go to like the best buy and you go to the mice

1056
04:13:59,159 --> 04:14:03,959
And some of these things are fucking transformers. I don't want that. It's like why that's annoying to me

1057
04:14:08,149 --> 04:14:10,149
I just want a big palm mouse

1058
04:14:10,790 --> 04:14:18,540
But I want there to be buttons and I want to have like decent dpi and decent scaling

1059
04:14:21,000 --> 04:14:23,000
And have a good optical

1060
04:14:23,850 --> 04:14:34,040
Ratio on it

1061
04:14:34,040 --> 04:14:48,889
Wow, you went across the whole map

1062
04:14:48,889 --> 04:14:54,569
G pro wireless. What's g pro wireless? I don't want a wireless mouthy. I don't I don't want a wireless mouth either

1063
04:14:55,049 --> 04:14:57,049
If I wireless mites

1064
04:14:57,290 --> 04:14:59,500
they

1065
04:14:59,500 --> 04:15:06,139
No, because I can feel the input delay. It's like two milliseconds, but I know it's there. I don't want a wireless mouth

1066
04:15:10,889 --> 04:15:13,450
I can feel like the bluetooth delay

1067
04:15:14,870 --> 04:15:38,600
I don't want it g 52. It's literally faster than wired

1068
04:15:42,229 --> 04:15:54,010
Pop honey in this band

1069
04:16:04,620 --> 04:16:15,879

1073
04:16:34,569 --> 04:16:39,239

Banned on steam but not on twitch. Oh, you just stay why are you so close?

1264
04:44:40,299 --> 04:44:44,389
Do the kid mission

1265
04:44:52,439 --> 04:44:54,439
Use jelly diver now no

1266
04:44:55,240 --> 04:44:57,400
Put jelly diver in in the last two missions

1267
04:45:11,900 --> 04:45:16,619
We just have the two most overpowered things there's a giant ship and a giant dragon

1268
04:45:18,630 --> 04:45:22,360
I won't eat him

1269
04:45:22,360 --> 04:45:33,509
Pretty good wise what he said. What's with it? I thought there was a no anime game policy

1270
04:45:35,689 --> 04:45:39,770
um

1271
04:45:39,770 --> 04:45:40,889
This is like

1272
04:45:40,889 --> 04:45:42,889
What do you mean anime?

1273
04:45:42,889 --> 04:45:50,939
What have I ever said that policy?

1274
04:45:51,580 --> 04:46:03,029
That's not my policy

1275
04:46:03,189 --> 04:46:04,709
The kid's getting talk

1276
04:46:04,709 --> 04:46:12,810
Just because I don't want to play doki-doki literature club does not mean I have a policy

1277
04:46:13,209 --> 04:46:16,090
Where I won't play a game that has like an animated character in it

1278
04:46:17,080 --> 04:46:18,599
more of these

1279
04:46:18,599 --> 04:46:20,279
Training with these people

1280
04:46:20,279 --> 04:46:27,080
Why will I not play doki-doki literature club?

1281
04:46:28,119 --> 04:46:30,009
because

1282
04:46:30,009 --> 04:46:33,020
I don't wanna

1283
04:46:33,020 --> 04:46:34,540
I already know

1284
04:46:34,540 --> 04:46:36,299
I already know everything

1285
04:46:36,299 --> 04:46:45,830
I don't need to do it

1286
04:46:45,909 --> 04:46:48,869
How hard these were until I got ice dragon

1287
04:46:56,700 --> 04:47:01,909
Ra turn turn

1288
04:47:02,549 --> 04:47:10,970
Do you know how challenging this game was for me a little bit? I had to jump around dive dive dive

1289
04:47:10,970 --> 04:47:12,970
Shoot shoot shoot shoot dodge dodge

1290
04:47:13,049 --> 04:47:18,599
Oh, I am powerful. I am the overpowered character

1291
04:47:22,009 --> 04:47:23,689
anime game policy

1292
04:47:23,689 --> 04:47:25,290
I played that

1293
04:47:25,290 --> 04:47:27,290
recetteer shop game

1294
04:47:27,610 --> 04:47:31,000
It's like hyper anime game

1295
04:47:31,560 --> 04:47:40,229
Because every time I pressed the a button in that game

1296
04:47:40,869 --> 04:47:43,049
The character would go

1297
04:47:46,360 --> 04:47:55,819
That was every a button press I had I thought it was fun

1298
04:48:03,049 --> 04:48:05,049
Apologize. I didn't say what you said

1299
04:48:05,799 --> 04:48:07,799
I said die chokedista

1300
04:48:08,200 --> 04:48:09,639
which means

1301
04:48:09,639 --> 04:48:11,319
God help us

1302
04:48:11,319 --> 04:48:27,700
Yeah, it means like help help me

1303
04:48:28,580 --> 04:48:29,860

Somebody just linked it click it. Oh cool. Uh magnet robot crash

1305
04:48:45,380 --> 04:49:00,279
It means are you okay? Wait, I think I got it. No, what the fuck how?

1306
04:49:12,439 --> 04:49:14,439
How did I get two c's?

1307
04:49:18,439 --> 04:49:25,349
No, I want no

1308
04:49:25,409 --> 04:49:27,909
C b a oh I need four

1309
04:49:28,790 --> 04:49:33,340
It's a d somewhere

1310
04:49:33,340 --> 04:49:44,500
God damn it

1311
04:49:44,500 --> 04:49:45,540
Hi

1312
04:49:45,540 --> 04:49:47,139

1313
04:49:47,139 --> 04:49:52,520
That was just as every stream I do

1314
04:49:52,680 --> 04:50:04,389
It was me talking at first and then you guys

1315
04:50:12,360 --> 04:50:15,419
What are you gonna do?

1316
04:50:15,419 --> 04:50:17,419
No, don't fight me

1317
04:50:17,500 --> 04:50:19,580
Just stand still while I press x and win

1318
04:50:21,459 --> 04:50:25,369
Stop fighting me. You're supposed to just lose

1319
04:50:42,279 --> 04:50:44,279
Dude, you you've lost

1320
04:50:45,450 --> 04:50:47,049
He just did the thing

1321
04:50:47,049 --> 04:50:51,819
It's not even good. This team sucks his team fucking terrible. This team's fucking awful

1322
04:50:55,020 --> 04:50:56,220
He just did it

1323
04:50:56,220 --> 04:51:16,659
Look at that damage

1324
04:51:16,659 --> 04:51:19,479
Yes burn

1325
04:51:19,639 --> 04:51:23,959
burn

1326
04:51:23,959 --> 04:51:34,900
Yeah

1327
04:51:34,900 --> 04:51:48,630
Oh it is i'm just over here. I just play

1328
04:51:49,270 --> 04:52:08,869
Is the game over yet? Not yet. I'm getting so many characters. Where were this at the beginning of the game?

1329
04:52:16,299 --> 04:52:30,360
Oh, I need to try it. Oh, I need to try it

1330
04:52:32,900 --> 04:52:34,659
That's going against

1331
04:52:34,659 --> 04:52:39,580
Beat the death force unit beat the bombing unit

1332
04:52:41,060 --> 04:52:43,060
Beat the death force unit

1333
04:52:43,060 --> 04:52:46,069
Oh, it's going against the strategy use jelly diver. No

1334
04:52:47,349 --> 04:52:55,990
Okay, fine here

1335
04:52:55,990 --> 04:52:59,669
It's been so long since he pressed a button other than x

1336
04:53:08,009 --> 04:53:10,009
I've pressed b sometimes

1337
04:53:15,590 --> 04:53:17,450
I do

1338
04:53:17,450 --> 04:53:19,669
see

1339
04:53:19,669 --> 04:53:28,310
Gee

1340
04:53:28,310 --> 04:53:30,310
This is too good. Why would I do anything else?

1341
04:53:30,709 --> 04:53:52,709
It's called me a furry

1342
04:53:52,709 --> 04:53:57,799
Uh, no, i'm not actually the term is fucking scaly o c o's

1343
04:53:58,360 --> 04:54:02,020
Somebody told me that like two years ago. So on this stream

1344
04:54:06,150 --> 04:54:07,750
What was that?

1345
04:54:07,750 --> 04:54:16,200
What was that?

1346
04:54:16,439 --> 04:54:29,770
You know how many times i've been corrected on this stream about what is and what isn't a furry

1347
04:54:31,509 --> 04:54:34,150
And if you by the way, if you have a frog, you're not a furry. You're like an

1348
04:54:35,250 --> 04:54:37,250
amphibioid or something, right?

1349
04:54:41,849 --> 04:54:51,220
What is it? But how could a frog be a more that doesn't make any sense?

1350
04:54:54,360 --> 04:54:56,299
It's a scaly

1351
04:54:56,299 --> 04:54:58,299
Frog how was a frog scaly?

1352
04:54:58,459 --> 04:55:00,779
It doesn't make any sense a slimy. Is that what they're called?

1353
04:55:02,020 --> 04:55:05,990
Be real with me here

1354
04:55:05,990 --> 04:55:08,869
Stop i've died just telling you what i've been told

1355
04:55:11,479 --> 04:55:14,680
Yeah, i'm just we're here you're here to correct me and help me understand these things

1356
04:55:26,540 --> 04:55:28,540
So it's slimer a scaly

1357
04:55:38,860 --> 04:55:46,779
Yes

1358
04:55:46,779 --> 04:55:49,500
Oh my computer is crashing

1359
04:55:54,380 --> 04:55:56,380
Oh type into your computer

1360
04:55:57,020 --> 04:56:04,060
Help fucking game sucks

1361
04:56:17,939 --> 04:56:19,700
What is making that?

1362
04:56:19,700 --> 04:56:21,060
Teacher noise

1363
04:56:21,060 --> 04:56:55,020
This is the last one finally, this is the weirdest counter-strike rats level ever

1364
04:56:58,889 --> 04:57:09,540
Probably gonna get a bomber

1365
04:57:09,540 --> 04:57:29,159
Time bomber remote bomber. It looks like we have another problem

1366
04:57:30,020 --> 04:57:32,500
Watch out veto. We're receiving a strong signal of the death force

1367
04:57:33,740 --> 04:57:35,979
Look at the greater tri-city area

1368
04:57:37,020 --> 04:57:39,020
It's a huge monster

1369
04:57:39,099 --> 04:57:43,349
What?

1370
04:57:43,349 --> 04:57:56,869
The gigantic battle defeat the cyber death dragon. I didn't save the game in like an hour

1371
04:57:57,270 --> 04:58:09,799
All right cyber death dragon

1372
04:58:09,799 --> 04:58:10,919

1373
04:58:10,919 --> 04:58:15,590
Let's do an edit here. I want we want jelly. We want jelly

1374
04:58:16,970 --> 04:58:19,610
Jelly jelly jelly jelly. All right fine

set bomb bomb shot

1378
04:58:32,180 --> 04:58:33,459
Good with bombs

1379
04:58:33,459 --> 04:58:36,970
It sounds too hard to do

1380
04:58:36,970 --> 04:58:41,139
remote bomber

1381
04:58:41,139 --> 04:58:42,740
Set bomb detonate

1382
04:58:42,740 --> 04:58:44,860
They both did the same thing

1383
04:58:44,860 --> 04:58:50,409
What was that wrestling group back in like the 90s?

1384
04:58:51,049 --> 04:58:53,540
The guys are the spikes the legion of doom

1385
04:58:54,099 --> 04:58:56,819
Yeah, i'm gonna put this guy in because he rhymes with the legion of doom

1386
04:59:00,180 --> 04:59:01,619
Uh

1387
04:59:01,619 --> 04:59:03,540
And where was the jelly guy?

1388
04:59:03,540 --> 04:59:15,700
I have done it. I don't know where the fuck he is. I'm gonna dump this whole box of toys in the recycling bin

1389
04:59:19,180 --> 04:59:21,700
Oh, wait, there's a worm

1390
04:59:21,700 --> 04:59:25,060
Okay, i'm gonna take the dragon out for now. I know you're gonna you're gonna go in the one good spot

Here we go

1410
05:00:26,360 --> 05:00:31,860
Let's try it. All right defeat the giant

1411
05:00:32,740 --> 05:00:35,110

1412
05:00:35,110 --> 05:00:43,159
dragon

1413
05:00:43,159 --> 05:00:59,360
Again, that's another stream that i've done this team sucks. I don't even know what the bug does

05:01:06,709 --> 05:01:10,360
Wait, oh I get it

1415
05:01:15,119 --> 05:01:17,119
He shoots out these spikes

1416
05:01:18,799 --> 05:01:20,799
They stay they stay

1417
05:01:20,799 --> 05:01:32,639
And he puts them down behind him, too

1418
05:01:33,040 --> 05:01:43,759
This is I kind of guy kind of cool but terrible at the same time

1419
05:01:48,869 --> 05:01:50,869
Just make death trap for everybody

1420
05:01:51,029 --> 05:02:04,279
So loud

1421
05:02:04,279 --> 05:02:11,750
Who is doing?

1422
05:02:11,750 --> 05:02:12,869
You're annoying

1423
05:02:12,869 --> 05:02:25,970
Anybody to tell you that?

1424
05:02:25,970 --> 05:02:27,569
Die, come on

1425
05:02:27,569 --> 05:02:29,560
It's like the final battle

1426
05:02:29,560 --> 05:02:37,520
Here he comes

1427
05:02:37,520 --> 05:02:54,869
Fuck didn't do anything

1428
05:02:54,869 --> 05:03:19,090
Whoa, oh this dude are they blowing up on it? I didn't read the instruction manual. Is it working?

1429
05:03:42,470 --> 05:04:01,560
Uh, I I did it. I'm the character that puts the suit on and has no idea how it works

1430
05:04:03,729 --> 05:04:05,729
But the suit is doing all kinds of powers

1431
05:04:06,369 --> 05:04:08,369
Who is it taking me? Whoa

1432
05:04:09,650 --> 05:04:14,369
I'll handle this jeremy. I'll handle this. What are you tired about? Whoa

1433
05:04:15,169 --> 05:04:38,599
He's dead. No, i'm dead jello. Oh slow motion in here

1434
05:04:45,729 --> 05:04:47,409
He's great

1435
05:04:47,409 --> 05:04:57,240
I just need to get that back and do it again

1436
05:05:09,810 --> 05:05:15,939
Stupid. Oh this is bad. I actually might still do it somehow magically

1437
05:05:17,810 --> 05:05:19,810
If I get another one of those things

1438
05:05:19,810 --> 05:05:21,889
Who's last?

1439
05:05:21,889 --> 05:05:23,330
Somebody's last

1440
05:05:23,330 --> 05:05:26,279
I have one or two more people left. Who was it?

1441
05:05:26,759 --> 05:05:36,319
Oh, he's dead

1442
05:05:36,319 --> 05:05:38,319
No damage before you died. Who is it?

1443
05:05:38,900 --> 05:05:40,020
New guy

1444
05:05:40,020 --> 05:05:47,560
I don't know what new guy does

1445
05:05:47,560 --> 05:06:03,270
New guy's about to die

1446
05:06:03,270 --> 05:06:05,270
Uh new guy's dead. Who's last?

1447
05:06:21,889 --> 05:06:27,090
I'll give you guys an A for effort. I did it. I beat the final dragon

1448
05:06:27,810 --> 05:06:34,040
I didn't know that a gachabor could increase in size like that

1449
05:06:34,840 --> 05:06:36,840
My headache stop. I am

1450
05:06:39,200 --> 05:06:40,799
Now the time has come

1451
05:06:40,799 --> 05:06:44,180
The galactic emperor has stolen his her personality

1452
05:06:44,979 --> 05:06:47,240
I have obtained enough gf energy from this human

1453
05:06:47,959 --> 05:06:50,200
You're not going to use the power that destroyed our planet again. Are you?

1454
05:06:54,040 --> 05:06:56,040
D-red this time with your help we can stop him

1455
05:06:56,599 --> 05:06:58,360
Give us your courage

1456
05:06:58,360 --> 05:07:00,759
We can never be defeated by the evil galactic emperor

1457
05:07:01,560 --> 05:07:04,599
Vito get ready for the final battle against the galactic emperor

1458
05:07:05,240 --> 05:07:17,779
Here we go the final battle. Just kidding

1459
05:07:18,580 --> 05:07:51,619
Here we go. Uh, just do the orange ones

1460
05:07:52,180 --> 05:07:54,419
Defeat the elite unit

1461
05:07:55,200 --> 05:07:58,799
This is this is okay. This is like the this is the hardest shit that we're at the end. This is the end

1462
05:07:59,200 --> 05:08:01,200
Do the last like five missions

1463
05:08:01,520 --> 05:08:04,159
Get rid of the jelly if I I can't get rid of the jelly now

1464
05:08:04,720 --> 05:08:06,720
All that matters is I have this ice dragon

1465
05:08:07,680 --> 05:08:16,360
What I mean, it's right there it was the last level

1466
05:08:26,610 --> 05:08:28,610
It was the last level

1467
05:08:31,189 --> 05:08:32,389
No

1468
05:08:32,389 --> 05:08:35,909
They figured it out. He's too slow. Just run around him

1469
05:08:36,470 --> 05:08:48,979
idiot

1470
05:08:48,979 --> 05:08:52,259
Falling in front of me. No, that's good

1471
05:08:55,000 --> 05:08:57,000
Don't let them fly. Don't let them fight. Don't let the fight do it

1472
05:08:57,720 --> 05:09:33,729
The cool dragon I know

1473
05:09:33,810 --> 05:09:36,610
I know but we're almost done. Don't worry

1474
05:09:47,950 --> 05:09:49,950
Godzilla godbeam is so good

1475
05:09:50,209 --> 05:09:52,340
Imagine if I didn't have that

1476
05:09:52,419 --> 05:09:53,860
I probably would have gave up

1477
05:09:53,860 --> 05:09:59,799
I would have been like guys. This is gonna take too long. I'm mostly going to scream for like four or five hours of dead time

1478
05:10:01,189 --> 05:10:03,189
I'm sorry. I can't do it anymore

1479
05:10:03,909 --> 05:10:05,909
But we got dragon so i'm able to

1480
05:10:33,569 --> 05:10:54,229
Damn it. They are

1481
05:10:54,310 --> 05:11:09,840
Fuck who do I have? This is the dumbest character in the whole game. Why is it even on here?

1482
05:11:10,000 --> 05:11:19,459
But I want the character to be the thing that I was gonna say i'll say it after the end of the stream

1483
05:11:31,029 --> 05:11:33,590
No, i'm not gonna say it. It's it's a literal

1484
05:11:34,549 --> 05:11:57,119
Bull I can't how come I can say it at the end because everyone's gonna leave

1485
05:11:57,759 --> 05:12:05,759
Did I make it? Oh fuck. Come on. Give me the next one

1486
05:12:06,869 --> 05:12:08,150

Final but dude, there's my guy

1491
05:12:47,479 --> 05:12:50,659

1494
05:12:55,139 --> 05:13:02,560
Where's my level three ninja?

1495
05:13:05,159 --> 05:13:07,159
All right, whatever. I don't care. He's not here

05:13:12,950 --> 05:13:22,069
You promised what?

1498
05:13:22,069 --> 05:13:23,909
normal ninja

1499
05:13:23,909 --> 05:13:26,159
Omega lull

Everyone is here, right?

1501
05:13:27,759 --> 05:13:29,759
I had to sneak away so my family wouldn't notice

1502
05:13:30,400 --> 05:13:32,080
Grown-ups are panicking

1503
05:13:32,080 --> 05:13:34,610
It would be everyone can see the huge monster in the air

1504
05:13:35,409 --> 05:13:38,319
I should have stayed hidden after all

1505
05:13:38,319 --> 05:13:40,159
I can do this. I can do this. I can do this

1506
05:13:40,159 --> 05:13:42,720
We have to save orochi, too

1513
05:14:00,639 --> 05:14:03,279

1514
05:14:03,840 --> 05:14:05,040

saviors of our earth

1523
05:14:24,319 --> 05:14:50,099

05:28:08,709 --> 05:28:12,790
Just throw all no, it's got to be two dragons and don't fucking move

1614
05:28:15,040 --> 05:28:17,700
Get rid of the normal ninjas and then

1615
05:28:20,229 --> 05:28:39,220
320 put in the blue ninja

1616
05:28:39,939 --> 05:28:47,810
Gatling gun is op

1617
05:28:47,810 --> 05:28:51,840
Ah, but we lose

1618
05:28:51,840 --> 05:28:53,840
But we lose the dragon

1619
05:28:54,319 --> 05:29:00,400
Who is fire dragon? He's fucking he's a thousand. He's a thousand

1620
05:29:04,369 --> 05:29:23,490
He's a thousand just put the ninjas between the dragons to build meter. That's a smart idea

1621
05:29:23,490 --> 05:29:55,799
I don't know why I didn't do it. All right, here we go. I gotta move move just back up get the eyes

That's good. All right back it up

1624
05:30:09,700 --> 05:30:15,810
Okay, now just stand here and land

1625
05:30:16,369 --> 05:30:19,810
This is it. This was calculated

1626
05:30:41,799 --> 05:30:46,200
Shit, this is not it's apparently not in a good spot. It's not hitting it. There we go right in the one in the corner

1627
05:30:46,759 --> 05:31:20,130
Okay, we're all right again. Okay, again again again. It's in the perfect spot

1628
05:31:24,310 --> 05:31:27,250
He's fucking dead right now

1629
05:31:27,250 --> 05:31:28,610
He's dead

1630
05:31:28,610 --> 05:31:30,610
Okay, don't panic. I have plenty of time

1631
05:31:31,169 --> 05:31:33,479
What just happened to him?

1632
05:31:33,479 --> 05:31:35,299
Okay, we're good

1633
05:31:35,299 --> 05:31:39,270
Build meter get up there and just hold the button down

1634
05:31:49,509 --> 05:31:51,909

1635
05:31:51,909 --> 05:31:57,919
Okay, come on dragon

05:32:02,130 --> 05:32:03,729
Okay, right there. Don't move

1638
05:32:03,729 --> 05:32:09,200
This is good, right? This is in the right spot

1639
05:32:12,720 --> 05:32:14,720
Okay, I got 270

1640
05:32:16,560 --> 05:32:19,799
What where am I?

1641
05:32:19,799 --> 05:32:21,799
No, it's in the wrong spot

1642
05:32:26,040 --> 05:32:29,029
beef core

1643
05:32:29,029 --> 05:32:37,080
Oh cop

1644
05:32:37,080 --> 05:32:39,080
Okay, turns out the gatling gunner. Uh

1645
05:32:39,400 --> 05:32:41,720
No, I can't even go so I can't even go up there

1646
05:32:46,049 --> 05:32:48,049
I can't even go up there with that guy

1647
05:32:50,180 --> 05:32:53,700
I brought the gatling gunner up and he just bounced around a hundred times. No get out of here

1648
05:32:53,779 --> 05:32:55,779
We're doing normal ninjas only

1649
05:32:56,020 --> 05:33:00,130
In the middle

1650
05:33:00,130 --> 05:33:02,130
I can't do three dragons. It's too much

1651
05:33:02,450 --> 05:33:10,680
I didn't even choke the flame dragon got fucking juggled around. I can't prevent that. I had a good spot

1652
05:33:11,639 --> 05:33:55,029
Fuck flame dragon just fucking blew it. Good asshole. He got knocked around and then out of place

1653
05:33:55,830 --> 05:33:58,000
Oh shit, let's go hurry up

1654
05:34:10,369 --> 05:34:12,369
I had it too

1655
05:34:16,819 --> 05:34:21,060
Bullshit what the hell even happened there?

1656
05:34:21,700 --> 05:34:25,990
All right. I'm not in a good spot. I gotta move

1657
05:34:26,790 --> 05:34:35,590
This is it. This is the spot. It's right there. Don't land you fucking idiot

1658
05:34:37,279 --> 05:34:38,560
turn

1659
05:34:38,560 --> 05:34:41,040
Go turn. What are you doing?

1660
05:34:52,360 --> 05:34:54,520
Don't step forward. I didn't tell you to do that

1661
05:35:08,529 --> 05:35:10,529
I need the power blast

1662
05:35:19,380 --> 05:35:21,380
All right, break it

1663
05:35:32,880 --> 05:35:39,580
Just kill him don't even do another phase just kill it. Oh you motherfucker

1664
05:35:41,319 --> 05:35:43,319
Oh, he's so close

1665
05:35:44,200 --> 05:35:53,200
Who's next?

1666
05:35:56,950 --> 05:36:00,709
I thought maybe crashing into himself. I don't know why

1667
05:36:09,000 --> 05:36:11,159
Okay, wait, I have a better idea

1668
05:36:13,409 --> 05:36:16,209
No, that's a terrible idea. Just kill it aim at it

1669
05:36:28,240 --> 05:36:39,240
Get me in that's all I want now. It's broken beef core. Whatever kill this. Okay. Here we go

1670
05:36:54,049 --> 05:36:57,090
It's not that kickball where you put your head down

1671
05:36:57,970 --> 05:36:59,409
and spin

1672
05:36:59,409 --> 05:37:00,770
until

1673
05:37:00,770 --> 05:37:03,729
Just stop

1674
05:37:03,729 --> 05:37:05,729
It's not even in the right spot. I have the power

1675
05:37:10,979 --> 05:37:13,380
Okay, stop right here

1676
05:37:13,380 --> 05:37:15,380
Land the fucking ship

1677
05:37:15,779 --> 05:37:17,779
Activate it stop turning

1678
05:37:17,939 --> 05:37:23,700
Turn the other way turn this way

1679
05:37:23,700 --> 05:37:24,979
Eat shit, I win

1680
05:37:24,979 --> 05:37:31,650
You just didn't play kickball. You put the bat down and you spin around a bunch of times and you're wicked dizzy

1681
05:37:32,290 --> 05:37:46,950
I win we did it. Oh, we got an animated end

1682
05:37:56,849 --> 05:37:59,220
No, you just made me choke on my water

1683
05:38:01,990 --> 05:38:05,330
The bat in kickball no

1684
05:38:16,630 --> 05:38:23,380
Bye oh that's how big they were I thought it was like 100 feet tall

1685
05:38:37,750 --> 05:38:40,659
Holy shit

1686
05:38:40,659 --> 05:38:42,659
battles 156

1687
05:38:43,540 --> 05:38:49,779
82 percent win percentage 82 gotcha boards 16 hours and nine minutes

1688
05:38:59,139 --> 05:39:02,630
battle results

1689
05:39:02,630 --> 05:39:03,430
team

1690
05:39:03,430 --> 05:39:05,430
Oh this how many times they were on the team?

1691
05:39:07,970 --> 05:39:09,250
Okay

1692
05:39:09,250 --> 05:39:11,250
Didn't really use the guy on third very much

1693
05:39:23,400 --> 05:39:26,000
Oh, that's not good

1694
05:39:26,000 --> 05:39:28,360
Apologize to mana

1695
05:39:28,360 --> 05:39:30,599
Just because they were on the team doesn't mean they did anything

1696
05:39:32,790 --> 05:39:34,790
You should know from doing group projects

1697
05:39:35,189 --> 05:39:41,590
She could have just been sleeping at her desk

1698
05:39:52,680 --> 05:40:04,259
The end see you again

1699
05:40:04,259 --> 05:40:42,560
Nice see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. That was gotcha force one of my favorite game cube games

1700
05:40:43,200 --> 05:40:46,979
Beat it fun

1701
05:40:47,060 --> 05:40:48,819
It was cool

1702
05:40:48,819 --> 05:40:50,740
Glad you enjoyed it

1703
05:40:50,740 --> 05:40:53,810
I'll see you tomorrow for pat upon

1704
05:40:53,889 --> 05:40:58,200
Pat upon one or two. I don't know. I'll figure it out before then we'll figure it out

1705
05:41:00,119 --> 05:41:01,479
That's gonna be it

1706
05:41:01,479 --> 05:41:04,470
Thanks for joining me as always

1707
05:41:04,470 --> 05:41:05,909
We'll see you

1708
05:41:05,909 --> 05:41:13,939
Oh, yeah, we'll figure it out in pre-stream chat. We'll figure it out

1709
05:41:14,740 --> 05:41:19,189
But we'll do the bits

1710
05:41:19,189 --> 05:41:21,029
We'll see you tomorrow. We'll see you tomorrow

1711
05:41:21,029 --> 05:41:25,189
Let me just get this other screen here

1712
05:41:26,680 --> 05:41:28,439
Move this over

1713
05:41:28,439 --> 05:41:31,520
It was a lot of fun. I'm glad I got to experience that on stream

1714
05:41:33,169 --> 05:41:35,169
Tell us the thing I will at the very end

1715
05:41:35,250 --> 05:41:43,360
At the very end, but for now we have 15 from shadow teddy. Thank you

1716
05:41:43,919 --> 05:41:48,319
Like the comedy chart. Oh, yeah, let's go before we go

1717
05:41:58,000 --> 05:42:00,000
It looks let's see

1718
05:42:03,520 --> 05:42:09,889
Not bad

1719
05:42:09,889 --> 05:42:10,930
Not bad

1720
05:42:10,930 --> 05:42:16,180
It's that little part in the middle. That's all

1721
05:42:16,419 --> 05:42:27,110
But thank you shadow teddy for the 15 dolls recently stumbled on your streams after years of watching a youtube vid youtube vids

1722
05:42:27,669 --> 05:42:30,869
Much love and thanks for the entertainment. Thanks for the 15 dolls and

1723
05:42:31,669 --> 05:42:36,180
Welcome. I was on youtube for a long time and

1724
05:42:37,060 --> 05:42:39,060
I'm about to be

1725
05:42:39,060 --> 05:42:43,080
On twitch for the same amount of time that I was on youtube if you could believe that

1726
05:42:43,720 --> 05:42:46,919
They're about to be tied

1727
05:42:46,919 --> 05:42:54,049
I was on youtube for about five to six years and now we're on twitch for about five years. So we're coming up there

1728
05:42:54,529 --> 05:42:58,759
Peaceful hailey. Thanks for the 250

1729
05:42:58,919 --> 05:43:02,319
I've been doubting myself again whether I should be streaming or not

1730
05:43:02,720 --> 05:43:05,040
Everyone always compliments me on it and like is super nice

1731
05:43:05,040 --> 05:43:09,279
But I get that one person who puts doubt in my mind whether I should be doing it or not

1732
05:43:09,840 --> 05:43:11,680
It's what I want to do, but i'm a girl

1733
05:43:11,680 --> 05:43:13,680
So I feel like I can't make it on twitch and i'm terrified

1734
05:43:14,240 --> 05:43:17,319
The compliments I do get feel like I don't deserve it

1735
05:43:17,880 --> 05:43:22,419
Like it's really a me issue. Well, i'll tell you right now. It sounds like you're second guessing yourself a little too much

1736
05:43:22,979 --> 05:43:31,430
streaming should be something that you want to do something that you've that you really feel like doing and

1737
05:43:32,880 --> 05:43:35,840
Sure, we make jokes on this channel about like, oh what do you want me to do? Look at me

1738
05:43:36,319 --> 05:43:39,200
What oh chat's bullying, but i'm gonna bully you you're bullying me what came

1739
05:43:39,840 --> 05:43:42,529
but at the end of the day

1740
05:43:42,529 --> 05:43:44,529
you need to

1741
05:43:45,299 --> 05:43:47,700
kind of be in control of you and

1742
05:43:48,819 --> 05:43:50,659
Be comfortable with what you're doing

1743
05:43:50,659 --> 05:43:53,919
Streaming should be something that you every time you turn it on you like this is what I want to do

1744
05:43:54,799 --> 05:44:00,400
And there will be people that are going to say negative shit. Unfortunately, this is the nature of the internet

1745
05:44:01,119 --> 05:44:04,500
It's the nature of kind of where we are. It's unfortunate, but it's true

1746
05:44:09,509 --> 05:44:14,520
and you either take some of the maybe more harsher criticisms or

1747
05:44:15,080 --> 05:44:17,240
Some of the negative comments of people that say things

1748
05:44:18,450 --> 05:44:21,090
And you either just ignore them or you know you

1749
05:44:22,200 --> 05:44:24,759
It's hard to not be like oh you shut up

1750
05:44:25,319 --> 05:44:32,959
What are you fucking dumb?

1751
05:44:32,959 --> 05:44:41,200
but just make sure it's something you want to do make sure something you really feel like doing because if it's not

1752
05:44:43,060 --> 05:44:44,259
And you'll know

1753
05:44:44,259 --> 05:44:52,630
Make the criticism feel you to do it more to do more and work harder

1754
05:44:53,840 --> 05:44:56,119
um

1755
05:44:56,119 --> 05:45:01,720
It's hard. Yeah, but at the same time some people just kind of come in and just say shit just because they're just being crazy

1756
05:45:02,520 --> 05:45:07,669
And some of the criticisms are some of the kind of attacking is just because they feel like doing it

1757
05:45:07,669 --> 05:45:10,389
It's not like oh, hey, here's what I think how I think you could improve your stream

1758
05:45:11,029 --> 05:45:16,720
But I wish you luck

1759
05:45:16,720 --> 05:45:19,200
Make sure you want to do it though. That's the most important thing

1760
05:45:22,639 --> 05:45:24,639
oiki, thanks for the five dollars

1761
05:45:24,639 --> 05:45:31,040
Remember chat has ruined me. I started saying resident sleeper in casual conversation or in texts when things were boring

1762
05:45:31,439 --> 05:45:33,439
And how to explain it to my mom what it meant

1763
05:45:34,340 --> 05:45:38,819
Then last night she sent me that she used it in a post on her political blog

1764
05:45:39,619 --> 05:45:45,009
But she talked about how much she hates joe biden, please help. Oh boy

1765
05:45:49,590 --> 05:45:53,430
oh, man

1766
05:45:53,430 --> 05:45:55,430
I I got nothing to say about that one. That's

1767
05:45:57,490 --> 05:45:59,349
that's a

1768
05:45:59,349 --> 05:46:00,950
you uh

1769
05:46:00,950 --> 05:46:04,549
Mom is now using your lingo and now you're gonna have to figure out another words

1770
05:46:05,639 --> 05:46:08,840
Because once your parents start doing it, you can't do it anymore. You gotta get resident sleeper

1771
05:46:08,840 --> 05:46:13,889
Now you gotta come up with a new one. It's over

1772
05:46:18,310 --> 05:46:24,319
Resident sleeper

1773
05:46:24,319 --> 05:46:28,759
Well, I hope you figure that out. She'll probably just get over after a while

1774
05:46:29,479 --> 05:46:32,200
She'll probably be like, I don't understand this. I'm gonna go back to saying

1775
05:46:33,000 --> 05:46:34,439
tired

1776
05:46:34,439 --> 05:46:36,439
Maybe not. Maybe she's here now

1777
05:46:38,930 --> 05:46:43,970
Major moose man. Thanks with 250 first don't know a long time fan. I've been only watching regularly since sakiro

1778
05:46:44,529 --> 05:46:46,900
Streams have really been helping me through college

1779
05:46:46,900 --> 05:46:50,340
And I know you said that if you didn't play it in november, you wouldn't stream it

1780
05:46:50,900 --> 05:46:54,020
But I was wondering if you ever play star wars jedi fall in order. It's not perfect

1781
05:46:54,500 --> 05:46:56,500
But its combat is like sick. I'm gonna stop you here

1782
05:46:56,900 --> 05:46:59,860
I played it for about 45 minutes off stream and I did not like it

1783
05:47:01,959 --> 05:47:07,520
I was not a fan first hour of that game or hour and a half was was climbing

1784
05:47:08,770 --> 05:47:20,450
Metal boxes and then sliding down and then I got killed like 15 times

1785
05:47:21,330 --> 05:47:22,209
by

1786
05:47:22,209 --> 05:47:49,729
That weird like pig dog thing. I was like, I don't want to play this. I love star wars. You got

1787
05:47:50,689 --> 05:47:55,189
mount fiji

1788
05:47:55,189 --> 05:47:59,349
You rage quit the tutorial. No, I got out of the tutorial and I got to that first area where you have to

1789
05:48:00,159 --> 05:48:02,799
Like track down the the jedi's smell

1790
05:48:03,599 --> 05:48:08,819
And I stumbled into this cave and there was like a boss in the cave and I was like, oh cool

1791
05:48:08,819 --> 05:48:10,900
The first boss and I died like after 10 times

1792
05:48:11,700 --> 05:48:15,220
And I was like, I don't even like this game. That's what happened. I'm just telling you the truth

1793
05:48:15,220 --> 05:48:27,009
I'm just telling you what happened. It went from 15 to 10. So that means it was 20

1794
05:48:27,729 --> 05:48:31,080
If you're paying attention

1795
05:48:31,080 --> 05:48:35,240
I love star wars. I just wasn't a bit. I yeah, I just wouldn't didn't grab me

1796
05:48:35,720 --> 05:48:43,250
Drummage door. Thanks for the 250. Yo funny man guy bro, dude mate friend. I watched your rhythm heaven heaven heaven. Hold on itchy

1797
05:48:43,970 --> 05:48:45,569
I've watched hey

1798
05:48:45,569 --> 05:48:53,590
Let's try that over. Hold on itching my eye. I watched your rhythm heaven fever stream. It's kind of a hard string of things to say

1799
05:48:54,389 --> 05:48:58,400
Uh, maybe realize you'd most likely really enjoy fantastic game called thumper

1800
05:48:59,520 --> 05:49:03,599
Uh, some have classified it as a psychedelic horror rhythm game. I've actually

1801
05:49:04,319 --> 05:49:07,779
I don't think I can play this from I remember looking at this before

1802
05:49:08,500 --> 05:49:10,500
This game really hurts my eyes

1803
05:49:12,419 --> 05:49:19,619
Something about like that moving with the neon colors and it kind of hurts my head

1804
05:49:20,180 --> 05:49:28,819
Yeah, my brain melts

1805
05:49:28,819 --> 05:49:35,560
Unfortunately, it looks fun, but I know I wouldn't be able to I'd be like i'd have to fucking stop after like 30 minutes

1806
05:49:39,779 --> 05:49:41,779
But no, it's it does look fun

1807
05:49:44,639 --> 05:49:46,799
One less game to get in the way of jeru crew

1808
05:49:49,110 --> 05:49:51,669
Red wall was thanks for five dollars germ a longtime watcher

05:49:54,470 --> 05:49:57,830
Just wanting to know that but also i'm wondering if you're going to play armored core

1811
05:49:59,029 --> 05:50:03,330

1812
05:50:03,330 --> 05:50:05,330

There's a lot of them just

1816
05:50:20,479 --> 05:50:22,240
There's only four

1817
05:50:22,240 --> 05:50:27,680
It's 15 games play them all or just play four

1818

Okay, which one what what if you guys can give me reliably?

1819
05:50:34,439 --> 05:50:40,279
The one or two that or the one that is the best one like the one that you should play

1820
05:50:43,110 --> 05:50:46,869
And i'll probably give it a try four is the one it's four. Okay

1821
05:50:51,889 --> 05:50:53,840

05:59:33,159 --> 05:59:37,319
Yeah, I would say yeah those but go to the north end some of those restaurants

1934
05:59:37,880 --> 05:59:39,639
They're they're insane

1935
05:59:39,639 --> 05:59:45,080
I don't remember very much any specifics, but i've had some of the best seafood i've ever had my whole life from the north end

1936
05:59:45,720 --> 05:59:50,849
I wish you luck. It's a great city. Have fun

1937
05:59:51,409 --> 05:59:58,310
All right, gooberry juice that we're talking about you soil that you play you get a real problem

1938
05:59:58,869 --> 06:00:00,389
Got some bird

1939
06:00:00,389 --> 06:00:04,020
Okay, i've tried everything to scare off these birds, but they're just too smart

1940
06:00:04,099 --> 06:00:08,259
I hung up tin foil strips and some cans to make some noise, but they don't give a shit

1941
06:00:09,409 --> 06:00:13,650
I try to I put the sprinklers to go on but they just wait till they turn off and they go back to eating

1942
06:00:14,209 --> 06:00:17,520
I made a scarecrow

1943
06:00:18,819 --> 06:00:20,819
This is your scarecrow

1944
06:00:25,880 --> 06:00:27,880
This scarecrow isn't gonna do anything

1945
06:00:28,279 --> 06:00:36,790
How would this scarecrow?

1946
06:00:37,029 --> 06:00:39,029
Ooh, that's macro

1947
06:00:52,659 --> 06:00:55,479
Um, why would that work?

1948
06:00:56,479 --> 06:01:01,520
I bought I broke down and made a scarecrow. Okay, I think they even ended up liking the scarecrow

1949
06:01:02,159 --> 06:01:04,880
I'm being jebaited by birds. I can't live like this anymore

1950
06:01:04,880 --> 06:01:09,040
Please if there's any advice you can give me to help my bird plight. I would be eternally grateful

1951
06:01:09,040 --> 06:01:13,759
By the way, that wasn't my sweater. I have a sex life all the time. That's good to know

1952
06:01:14,840 --> 06:01:17,000
Um, okay. I'm gonna i'm gonna solve your problem right now

1953
06:01:18,630 --> 06:01:20,630
You ready buy a bird feeder

1954
06:01:21,270 --> 06:01:23,639
Fill it with bird seed

1955
06:01:23,639 --> 06:01:27,479
And move it 10 feet away from where you want them to avoid

1956
06:01:28,119 --> 06:01:38,840
I just solved your problem

1957
06:01:38,840 --> 06:01:43,479
Get bird seed get like the most delicious bird seed that you know find out what kind of birds they are

1958
06:01:43,799 --> 06:01:45,799
Find out their eating habits and what they like

1959
06:01:47,119 --> 06:01:51,270
and then if you like if you have a bird problem over here with the soil and

1960
06:01:52,150 --> 06:02:00,610
No, no, no, no, no, their favorite restaurant is 10 feet away. Why are you guys saying? No, don't do not do that

1961
06:02:01,250 --> 06:02:04,240
Are you saying bribe the birds?

1962
06:02:04,240 --> 06:02:08,639
I'm saying create a bird restaurant that they go to that you can just fill with like

1963
06:02:08,799 --> 06:02:12,880
Four dollar bag of bird seed that they like once like every three weeks

1964
06:02:24,319 --> 06:02:28,639
And then and then they'll hang out and you'll have like some music while you're out working in the yard

1965
06:02:29,650 --> 06:02:32,849
And you get to enjoy the cool birds over at the bird restaurant

1966
06:02:33,330 --> 06:02:37,200
But then you're probably gonna get another problem squirrels love that shit

1967
06:02:37,599 --> 06:02:44,450
So then you'll end up having a squirrel problem and then I can't help you after that. I have I I only solve one problem at a time

1968
06:02:46,159 --> 06:02:49,459

Would you call his message fucked up now? No, but you can't you can't burn the barn down

Wait, if you do a double copyright, just one copyright like kill the other copyright. How does that work?

2053
06:12:50,979 --> 06:12:54,659
Does one supersede the other do they do they copyright fight each other?

2054
06:12:55,540 --> 06:13:13,330
How does it work?

2055
06:13:13,330 --> 06:13:14,849
hell

2056
06:13:14,849 --> 06:13:33,189
That's really cool. I'm gonna have to listen to more of these later when i'm in the bath

2057
06:13:33,750 --> 06:13:42,049
Oh, i'll tell you a quick little story about the bath. I took a bath last night

2058
06:13:42,770 --> 06:13:45,349
and um

2059
06:13:45,349 --> 06:13:46,759
I

2060
06:13:46,759 --> 06:13:48,360
Have this device

2061
06:13:48,360 --> 06:13:50,360
That I put my ipad in

2062
06:13:51,159 --> 06:13:54,919
And it hooks into the ipad and it's this big stretchy

2063
06:13:55,540 --> 06:13:56,919
solid it's

2064
06:13:56,919 --> 06:14:01,560
Like a big wire that I can fold and move around and it can the ipad can stand up

2065
06:14:01,959 --> 06:14:05,720
You can bend it you can put it around your arm. You can put it on the edge of a bed and it's pretty cool

2066
06:14:05,799 --> 06:14:08,150
It's actually a really cool device

2067
06:14:08,150 --> 06:14:12,369
Um, so yesterday I was filling the bathtub and I was setting this thing up

2068
06:14:13,330 --> 06:14:15,889
And it was like getting it ready

2069
06:14:18,069 --> 06:14:22,209
And I turned the water on and the ipad

2070
06:14:23,110 --> 06:14:24,549
shook a little bit

2071
06:14:24,549 --> 06:14:26,790
Because it was like I had it standing up on the edge

2072
06:14:27,750 --> 06:14:29,750
And it fell into the water

2073
06:14:30,150 --> 06:14:34,599
And by the way the water wouldn't even like really turned on it was like just barely like not even a tenth of a

2074
06:14:34,599 --> 06:14:40,560
Centimeter of water on the ground and it like went into the water and like I grabbed it immediately and then I was fine

2075
06:14:40,639 --> 06:14:44,479
And I wiped it off quickly with the towel and it's fine

2076
06:14:44,479 --> 06:14:46,799
I mean, no the water was like on but it wasn't like the whole bath

2077
06:14:46,799 --> 06:14:51,080
It was like just hitting the surf that was hitting the bottom. You know what I mean? It was a good story

2078
06:14:57,159 --> 06:15:04,119
Water wasn't on he just dropped his ipad in the bathtub and he added the water part to make you think

2079
06:15:04,520 --> 06:15:08,919
That wall that could have been crazy, but there was no water in that tub. He's a liar

2080
06:15:09,319 --> 06:15:18,020
No, there was water in that tub. Not very much

2081
06:15:22,240 --> 06:15:24,240
Were you naked when it happened? Yes

2082
06:15:27,330 --> 06:15:35,880
What were you gonna tell us at the end of the stream you phony fucking piece of shit. Hey relax

2083
06:15:36,599 --> 06:15:40,880
It's a thought project

2084
06:15:40,880 --> 06:15:44,240
No, I actually did drop the fucking in the bathtub. It was bad

06:16:10,529 --> 06:16:12,610
It on the side, but it fell but the water wasn't on but the water was on

Thanks for being here you i'm talking to you you you in the back back there you in the back

2108
06:17:24,720 --> 06:17:27,669
You've been talking through the whole stream

2109
06:17:27,990 --> 06:17:30,930
You know, there's a part in um

2110
06:17:31,250 --> 06:17:32,689
Bill Murray

2111
06:17:32,689 --> 06:17:34,689
Did this movie called Scrooged?

2112
06:17:35,779 --> 06:17:37,220
and

2113
06:17:37,220 --> 06:17:39,220
It's about Bill Murray. It becomes

2114
06:17:40,020 --> 06:17:42,500
Ebenezer Scrooge. It's kind of a weird movie. It's a good movie though

2115
06:17:43,299 --> 06:17:45,459
At the very end of the movie

2116
06:17:45,459 --> 06:17:51,299
He's thanking everybody for watching. He's like, hey, thanks sir. Thank you. Thank all all the men

2117
06:17:52,740 --> 06:17:55,619
Thanks all the men there all the women. Thank you all the women

2118
06:17:56,259 --> 06:17:58,259
Thank you. Thank the dog

2119
06:17:58,419 --> 06:18:03,060
And you the person that's been talking the whole movie he points right at the

2120
06:18:03,779 --> 06:18:08,520
Screen and I was watching the movie with my cousin at the time and the cousin freaked out

2121
06:18:08,919 --> 06:18:13,139
We were like 12 like 10 whatever and she was like what me?

2122
06:18:13,459 --> 06:18:16,419
Oh like he's talking to me and i'm like, holy shit. He's talking to you

2123
06:18:16,979 --> 06:18:19,939
You were talking this whole movie. What the hell? How does he know?

2124
06:18:25,669 --> 06:18:35,400
Hopefully I just did that to somebody else. There's another made-up story

2125
06:18:39,810 --> 06:18:41,810
No, what a dumb thing to make up

2126
06:18:42,369 --> 06:18:44,209
All these things I say

2127
06:18:44,209 --> 06:18:47,729
But i'm I just fucking I got you. I you have no idea what could be real

2128
06:18:48,369 --> 06:18:53,090
I have such i'm such a master of illusions. You have no idea

2129
06:18:53,569 --> 06:18:58,930
I I might not even be fucking 34 years old. I might be fucking 40. I might be 20

2130
06:18:59,009 --> 06:19:09,939
You have no idea how old I am. Yes, you do. No, that was funny

2131
06:19:09,939 --> 06:19:11,939
It was a funny thing that happened when I was a kid

2132
06:19:12,630 --> 06:19:19,139
Hey, thanks for the subs though. All of you brian the last dinosaur

2133
06:19:19,779 --> 06:19:22,500
Thanks for the three dollars get a logitech mx-5 18

2134
06:19:23,139 --> 06:19:25,080
I think we caught that one earlier

2135
06:19:25,080 --> 06:19:28,819
It's a perfect mouse that will last you literally decades like my old one did

2136
06:19:29,299 --> 06:19:32,790
I have to tell you logitech is a good company, right?

2137
06:19:33,349 --> 06:19:39,650
Logitech makes pretty good shit. Don't they from what i've seen and heard?

2138
06:19:40,290 --> 06:19:42,930
Kind of yeah

2139
06:19:42,930 --> 06:19:45,240
What about the music? I got you

2140
06:19:50,049 --> 06:19:51,810
I'll have to give it a look

2141
06:19:51,810 --> 06:19:57,720
Animal jason, thanks for three dollars. No, you can't just watch a streamer because he does funny voices. Haha grandpa voice go brr

2142
06:19:58,279 --> 06:20:02,560
That's true

2143
06:20:02,560 --> 06:20:05,520
Oath horse. Thanks for the thousand bits really fun stream today

2144
06:20:06,240 --> 06:20:11,520
I painted a bob ross painting while listening the pog market is a hilarious idea

2145
06:20:12,000 --> 06:20:13,759
Looking forward to seeing what you do with it

2146
06:20:13,759 --> 06:20:18,880
I love your childlike enjoyment of gotcha force nostalgia over a game that literally no one in the chat likes

2147
06:20:19,779 --> 06:20:21,919
I love that you don't care

2148
06:20:21,919 --> 06:20:24,720
Also, the music makes me want to claw all the flesh off my face

2149
06:20:27,319 --> 06:20:30,279
Well, I mean there's a story there. I'm not going to get bullied twice in a row

2150
06:20:31,880 --> 06:20:38,229
Beautiful joe was like escape sucks. It's boring do something. I hate this and I was like, okay fine

2151
06:20:38,630 --> 06:20:44,180
It's not gonna happen twice in a row. You got your veto your vetoed beautiful joe

2152
06:20:44,819 --> 06:20:47,139
I'm gonna play my two hundred and fifty dollar piece of plastic

2153
06:20:57,939 --> 06:20:59,939
CD made out of plastic metal

2154
06:21:00,259 --> 06:21:02,759
What is a cd made out of?

2155
06:21:02,759 --> 06:21:05,720
Aluminum metal. I that's an I seriously what?

2156
06:21:06,360 --> 06:21:10,529
Is a cd made out of is it plastic? It's like a weird compound

2157
06:21:12,450 --> 06:21:14,470
Tough brittle plastic called polycarbonate

2158
06:21:16,180 --> 06:21:21,650
And sandwiched in the middle is a is aluminum, right? Okay. I had it right plastic and aluminum. I had it right

2159
06:21:22,130 --> 06:21:31,599
No, it was fun. Thanks for the thousand bits

2160
06:21:32,159 --> 06:21:38,000
You have a kitty. Thanks for the 250 germa. You won't be the first one to finish gotcha force on twitch

2161
06:21:38,880 --> 06:21:40,500
uh

2162
06:21:40,500 --> 06:22:05,569
Some summa did it a few weeks ago ban this person

2163
06:22:10,759 --> 06:22:13,560
Is this where I go? What's who's summer?

2164
06:22:14,119 --> 06:22:16,119
What's who's summer and then you say summer

2165
06:22:16,599 --> 06:22:19,799
Is this when is this how is this how this joke plays out?

2166
06:22:27,919 --> 06:22:29,220
Yeah

2167
06:22:29,220 --> 06:22:31,880
right, okay

2168
06:22:31,880 --> 06:22:36,680
Dark soul. Thanks for 250. Are you not able to do the amazon watch together streams on here or something?

2169
06:22:37,319 --> 06:22:40,759
I've seen other streamers able to use that and watch like star trek

2170
06:22:41,159 --> 06:22:44,400
We should see what's on there and maybe we can watch something pog instead

2171
06:22:45,200 --> 06:22:47,840
By the way, if you're going to do half life alex

2172
06:22:48,720 --> 06:22:52,319
You should do that before bone works because bone works is so good. I think alex just sucks

2173
06:22:53,560 --> 06:22:56,630
damn a strong opinion

2174
06:22:59,000 --> 06:23:06,400
Uh, I don't know man. Um, the reason why I didn't do the amazon watch party is because

2175
06:23:07,840 --> 06:23:09,840
It's a very limited catalog of stuff

2176
06:23:11,360 --> 06:23:13,680
And it's only available to the united states

2177
06:23:14,240 --> 06:23:18,500
So I was like, yeah

2178
06:23:18,500 --> 06:23:22,180
Maybe if they start opening that up that might be fun to do like officially

2179
06:23:24,369 --> 06:23:27,729
But yeah, it's only united states and it's only if you have amazon prime

2180
06:23:29,029 --> 06:23:34,549
And I i'll be honest. I'm not in the market of trying to make less people watch my stream

2181
06:23:35,840 --> 06:23:40,880
I don't that's not i'm not into I don't want to do that. I have no interest in doing that

2182
06:23:41,360 --> 06:23:48,040
You have to have amazon prime you have to have twitch prime you have to be from the united states

2183
06:23:48,599 --> 06:23:51,959
Like I just like carved off a significant portion of people that watch

2184
06:23:52,520 --> 06:23:55,639
I'm in the market of wanting people to watch not telling people they can't

2185
06:23:57,909 --> 06:24:00,790
It's a kind of like an exclusive club thing that I don't really want to do

2186
06:24:10,209 --> 06:24:21,159
If they start expanding it, then yeah, i'll try it. But as of right now, probably not doctor zero fox

2187
06:24:21,319 --> 06:24:23,319
Thanks for the 15 dollars

2188
06:24:23,479 --> 06:24:25,799
They say u w u

2189
06:24:26,520 --> 06:24:28,520
U w u

2190
06:24:28,599 --> 06:24:31,360
Thanks to 15 bucks

2191
06:24:31,360 --> 06:24:33,520
Hey dried cleaner. Thanks to 300 bits germa

2192
06:24:33,520 --> 06:24:37,119
I was wondering if you ever played fable 2 or streamed it some of the best games ever

2193
06:24:37,200 --> 06:24:38,560
I recommend it for one of your streams

2194
06:24:38,560 --> 06:24:44,049
I played this shit out of fable 2 played this shit out of fable 1 and I got to the part in fable 3

2195
06:24:44,630 --> 06:24:47,430
Where you opened up chests to do things?

2196
06:24:48,069 --> 06:24:50,470
And said this game sucks and stopped playing it

2197
06:24:50,470 --> 06:25:02,130
It was like within the first hour and a half, but I do I love that franchise

2198
06:25:02,209 --> 06:25:04,209
I've played the hell out of the first two games

2199
06:25:04,369 --> 06:25:13,619
They're very fun, but probably not on stream. I've played through them multiple times

2200
06:25:14,180 --> 06:25:17,220
With multiple characters doing multiple builds there's not much else

2201
06:25:17,220 --> 06:25:21,459
I can do in fable 1 and 2 that I have not done in a playthrough that i've done years ago

2202
06:25:25,029 --> 06:25:32,470
They're great though peaceful. Haley. Thanks for the 250. I don't want to be a debbie downer

2203
06:25:32,950 --> 06:25:36,069
But to be honest, I don't have anyone in my real day-to-day life to talk to

2204
06:25:36,470 --> 06:25:39,750
But an hour ago me and my boyfriend split up after five years

2205
06:25:40,560 --> 06:25:43,680
We've known each other for longer, but god, I never thought this would happen

2206
06:25:44,319 --> 06:25:47,680
I need to focus on me now. I don't really know what else to say. Thanks for listening

2207
06:25:48,159 --> 06:25:53,159
That's a long relationship. That's a long time

2208
06:25:54,209 --> 06:25:56,840
But you're right

2209
06:25:56,840 --> 06:25:59,810
Now you do you

2210
06:25:59,810 --> 06:26:02,240
You take care of your life

2211
06:26:02,240 --> 06:26:03,439
And move forward

2212
06:26:03,439 --> 06:26:12,689
That's really all you can do

2213
06:26:12,689 --> 06:26:14,689
You don't back up on the highway

2214
06:26:18,689 --> 06:26:28,849
forward

2215
06:26:28,849 --> 06:26:33,540
Maybe you don't

2216
06:26:33,540 --> 06:26:36,200
Your analogies suck

2217
06:26:36,200 --> 06:26:42,680
What if you're on the highway you go forward you don't stop you don't go back you move forward and you go to your exit

2218
06:26:43,159 --> 06:26:45,000
If you miss your exit

2219
06:26:45,000 --> 06:26:50,740
You don't stop you fucking go forward and you find another way to get off the next exit and you finally figure out you fucking

2220
06:26:50,900 --> 06:27:00,950
Where you go?

2221
06:27:00,950 --> 06:27:02,950
You clip through the trees

2222
06:27:08,720 --> 06:27:13,520
No, you don't do that

2223
06:27:13,520 --> 06:27:16,790
You go off road

2224
06:27:16,790 --> 06:27:18,790
What kind of car do you drive?

2225
06:27:18,790 --> 06:27:24,400
but anyways

2226
06:27:24,400 --> 06:27:31,700
Uh, i'm gonna say it again. You don't go reverse on the highway done and that's exactly how you should feel

2227
06:27:33,279 --> 06:27:42,180
Forward don't look back forward clip through any trees. Don't just fucking go forward

2228
06:27:42,979 --> 06:27:44,180
right

2229
06:27:44,180 --> 06:27:48,209
Chat beta streamer doesn't turn around on the highway

2230
06:27:48,930 --> 06:27:50,930
Yeah, beta streamer doesn't

2231
06:27:50,930 --> 06:27:52,869
Die in a car wreck

2232
06:27:52,869 --> 06:27:55,270
Okay, that sounds good. That sounds great. Actually

2233
06:27:57,119 --> 06:28:03,569
Good. Okay

2234
06:28:03,569 --> 06:28:05,569
Why the trees on the highway?

2235
06:28:05,889 --> 06:28:12,759
Can you imagine if they were just a bunch of trees in the road and you have you going like 60 plus miles per hour?

2236
06:28:13,639 --> 06:28:17,400
Holy shit, what a design oversight that would have been

2237
06:28:21,540 --> 06:28:23,540
That's challenge mode

2238
06:28:25,040 --> 06:28:30,639
It would be like skiing in the olympics those flags

2239
06:28:32,659 --> 06:28:37,090
but anyways, hailey

2240
06:28:37,090 --> 06:28:38,930
I wish you the best that's

2241
06:28:38,930 --> 06:28:40,930
It's not the best thing to happen

2242
06:28:41,009 --> 06:28:51,619
But you'll be all right. Just keep going forward. Don't fucking go on. They don't hit the brakes on the highway

2243
06:28:51,779 --> 06:28:55,400
And the germa 985 says dog shit advice

2244
06:28:56,389 --> 06:29:00,389
Literally never ask germa for advice on anything because all of his advice

2245
06:29:00,950 --> 06:29:01,669
is

2246
06:29:01,669 --> 06:29:07,619
dog shit

2247
06:29:07,619 --> 06:29:12,099
true

2248
06:29:12,180 --> 06:29:14,180
Hit the brakes ever

2249
06:29:14,819 --> 06:29:19,110
No, don't no do that when you're getting off

2250
06:29:19,889 --> 06:29:22,930
Do that when you're getting off you have to hit the brakes when you're getting off

2251
06:29:23,009 --> 06:29:34,069
Otherwise, you're gonna be in big trouble. I wish you the best though. Take care of yourself. Take care of you

2252
06:29:35,939 --> 06:29:39,459
Hey, thank you mick for the $15 germa. It's good to see you play a game

2253
06:29:39,459 --> 06:29:40,580
You like so much

2254
06:29:40,580 --> 06:29:47,569
And i'm excited for you to get back to finishing every nancy drew game back to back. You're gonna be very disappointed

2255
06:29:47,970 --> 06:30:00,680
Thanks the 15 bucks old 70 ham. Thanks for three dollars and 20 cents

2256
06:30:00,840 --> 06:30:02,439
Hey germa

2257
06:30:02,439 --> 06:30:14,040
Here's some bite-sized bits because you're epic. Oh, thanks. Do I get the junkie donut? Thanks for three bucks

2258
06:30:18,180 --> 06:30:20,180
Rock writing. Thanks for the 300 bits

2259
06:30:21,119 --> 06:30:24,240
Uh, you don't have to read this if you want to wrap the stream up. No, we're good. We're good

2260
06:30:24,959 --> 06:30:27,119
I mean i'm i'm about 30 minutes over my

2261
06:30:27,759 --> 06:30:30,799
Time but at my maximum time, but we got an over heel going. It's okay

2262
06:30:31,680 --> 06:30:36,880
This is this. It's good. Just not like eight hours

2263
06:30:36,959 --> 06:30:40,639
Like i'm I just can't I gotta stop doing like the fucking seven to

2264
06:30:41,520 --> 06:30:43,520
Eight plus hour streams. I can't do them anymore

2265
06:30:46,849 --> 06:30:48,849
Like I physically have to stop doing those

2266
06:30:49,840 --> 06:30:51,840
I'm sorry, but it's just the it's reality

2267
06:31:00,259 --> 06:31:03,619
No more 12 hours. No, the lord of the rings stream will be the longest stream

2268
06:31:03,619 --> 06:31:06,659
I will ever do ever until the stream doesn't stream anymore

2269
06:31:07,459 --> 06:31:11,459
It sucks. Well, actually i'm actually kind of happy about that. That's fine. But anyways, they say

2270
06:31:12,180 --> 06:31:17,060
Uh, my fiance and I watched the complete lord of the rings trilogy last night perfect timing

2271
06:31:18,020 --> 06:31:20,819
And I hate that now my nostalgic connection to the soundtrack

2272
06:31:21,380 --> 06:31:25,700
Has been replaced with a fever dream. That was when I fell asleep to your two towers stream

2273
06:31:26,360 --> 06:31:29,959
Then woke up at some unholy hour of the night to the uruk-hai theme

2274
06:31:30,520 --> 06:31:33,400
On a seemingly endless loop and you trying to knock down

2275
06:31:33,959 --> 06:31:36,520
Those damn orc ladders playing his gimli

2276
06:31:37,240 --> 06:31:46,159
Anyway, my best to you chat and auto, you know, it's really sad. Is somebody telling me that I have

2277
06:31:46,959 --> 06:31:50,770
Ruined the lord of the rings for them. That's heavy

2278
06:31:53,189 --> 06:31:54,229
That's

2279
06:31:54,229 --> 06:31:58,450
That's tough to hear. Holy that's not that's bad

2280
06:32:00,900 --> 06:32:05,479
Something that is so hard to ruin for somebody is that franchise and i've done it somehow

2281
06:32:12,840 --> 06:32:14,840
I've never seen the films looked boring

2282
06:32:15,889 --> 06:32:21,759
Really good. You'll like them. Just watch them watch them when you have like the amount of time

2283
06:32:22,319 --> 06:32:24,319
When you get like three weeks to yourself

2284
06:32:24,720 --> 06:32:34,930
Watch the lord of the rings, but thanks rock rock writing. Sorry to have ruined your favorite franchise ever mine, too

2285
06:32:35,490 --> 06:32:37,159
Thanks, three bucks

2286
06:32:37,159 --> 06:32:41,400
Shadows one disciple. Thanks for the 250 germa. Your enthusiasm forgot your force is palpable

2287
06:32:41,720 --> 06:32:44,360
It's great when you love a game. Don't let chat tell you differently

2288
06:32:44,520 --> 06:32:47,299
I would probably enjoy this game too, but I don't have a game cube

2289
06:32:47,459 --> 06:32:51,409
I played the hell out of a similar game on playstation 3 called battle of z

2290
06:32:53,599 --> 06:33:00,049
However, I am more concerned about something else. Where did you get your degree in gaming slash gamers licenses?

2291
06:33:00,869 --> 06:33:06,520
I couldn't find a certificate of gaming for you in nevada, massachusetts nor anywhere in new england. Are you certified?

2292
06:33:06,759 --> 06:33:11,139
You don't have to have you don't have to yeah, I am

2293
06:33:12,369 --> 06:33:22,020
Look, I got my certification when I was like eight years old. So this doesn't expire. I got my championship

2294
06:33:22,819 --> 06:33:32,360
Uh, I got my gamer championship license thing that I showed that happened when I was a kid. They never expire

2295
06:33:32,599 --> 06:33:42,479
You never have to renew them the blockbuster video game championships. Yeah, I got two free rentals a month for a year

2296
06:33:42,720 --> 06:34:01,490
I have certified. I haven't been recertified in a long time. Doesn't mean I wasn't thanks at the 250 though

2297
06:34:02,049 --> 06:34:07,840
Thanks at the 250 though wembley ttv

2298
06:34:07,840 --> 06:34:14,000
Thanks to the 250 I showed a pal of mine who was a gt driver the burnout spy cam video with no context

2299
06:34:14,560 --> 06:34:18,319
His first reaction was looking at your license photo saying what is that?

2300
06:34:18,880 --> 06:34:21,119
I guess you do have that sort of effect on people

2301
06:34:23,569 --> 06:34:25,569
Yeah, I remember. Yeah, I remember this

2302
06:34:25,889 --> 06:34:28,529
Yeah with the the terrifying

2303
06:34:30,099 --> 06:34:35,540
Balding head face down like a long face with the nose. Yeah, it's horrible

2304
06:34:36,099 --> 06:34:38,099
That's the second image on the internet that I hate

2305
06:34:45,840 --> 06:34:49,599
The eye crazy eyes mouth one is number one

2306
06:34:50,319 --> 06:35:01,139
And in the bathrobe head pointed down eyes up is the other one. Thanks to the 250

2307
06:35:01,700 --> 06:35:08,580
Hey dark soul. Thanks for 250 if you want to play another fun robo game, you should try gundam breaker 3 for playstation 4

2308
06:35:09,299 --> 06:35:13,270
You have to import it or use an hk account

2309
06:35:14,869 --> 06:35:18,310
HK account is on amazon and play asia in an english version

2310
06:35:18,790 --> 06:35:22,229
It's a really good game, especially if you want to make your own cool gunplay fighter

2311
06:35:23,040 --> 06:35:34,450
Don't play new gundam breaker on pc though. That one sucks. All right done. Stop making his list bigger

2312
06:35:36,479 --> 06:35:38,479
Don't make his list bigger

2313
06:35:38,799 --> 06:35:45,750
The list is never ending. It's like your christmas list. Did you guys ever do the christmas? Okay

2314
06:35:46,470 --> 06:35:48,150
I remember when I was a kid

2315
06:35:48,150 --> 06:35:49,830
we used to get the

2316
06:35:49,830 --> 06:35:56,099
There would be this catalog that came in the mail and they I don't know if it was like jc penny or

2317
06:35:56,659 --> 06:35:59,299
With some big box store and they had a toy section

2318
06:35:59,860 --> 06:36:05,669
And I remember what I would do is I'd take the this huge catalog and I would just take a sharpie

2319
06:36:06,150 --> 06:36:09,189
And I would circle every single thing I wanted for christmas

2320
06:36:10,819 --> 06:36:16,290
and give it to my parents like this is what I want here it is and

2321
06:36:17,189 --> 06:36:19,029
it was like

2322
06:36:19,029 --> 06:36:27,139
Two grand worth of stuff. It's like oh, oh, oh, this is what this is what you think santa's gonna bring you

2323
06:36:27,919 --> 06:36:29,919
Wow, okay. Well, we'll see

2324
06:36:30,389 --> 06:36:36,720
And you're getting like a quarter of a percent of the stuff on that on the stuff you circled and you don't even remember

2325
06:36:39,479 --> 06:36:50,020
Like maybe like not even a tenth of those things is what you got for christmas. I just don't oh wow

2326
06:36:50,099 --> 06:36:53,439
Yeah, I like this. I don't remember circling like

2327
06:36:54,299 --> 06:37:04,020
125 items got to be young more like one 100th. Yeah

2328
06:37:04,659 --> 06:37:10,400
Did you expect to get it all mine was a wish list? I don't know my like

2329
06:37:10,959 --> 06:37:14,959
Seven-year-old brain thought that hey, this is what I get. That's what I want

2330
06:37:20,689 --> 06:37:23,250
Yeah, it's a wish list means I wish I had all this

2331
06:37:25,720 --> 06:37:38,400
Here wish-grant hers make this a reality parents. That's how it was. He's a cringe rich kid

2332
06:37:40,259 --> 06:37:41,990
What?

2333
06:37:41,990 --> 06:37:47,639
Spoiled no, I just told you that they would be like, oh, okay, and I would get like I would get like

2334
06:37:48,119 --> 06:37:57,380
Maybe six items. I see some of your fucking christmas tweets and christmas things you guys get

2335
06:37:58,790 --> 06:38:05,680
I see some of the toys that you get some of you guys get like fucking sneakers like 300 dollar pairs of sneakers

2336
06:38:06,319 --> 06:38:18,049
How does he know? I know

2337
06:38:18,049 --> 06:38:21,619
I used to have to walk around with loaves of bread on my feet

2338
06:38:22,180 --> 06:38:26,639
That's what we did. We had two loaves of bread and we would squish on them and walk on them

2339
06:38:27,889 --> 06:38:38,580
And how dare you guys?

2340
06:38:42,240 --> 06:38:44,240
Family walking around

2341
06:38:45,119 --> 06:38:48,529
Like let's say you got a family of five

2342
06:38:48,529 --> 06:38:56,900
That's 10 loaves of bread and they would just get all mushed up and it would only work for like not even a day

2343
06:38:57,990 --> 06:39:00,310
You'd be going through like 50 loaves of bread a week

2344
06:39:02,610 --> 06:39:17,479
loafers

2345
06:39:17,479 --> 06:39:20,069
Okay. All right

2346
06:39:20,069 --> 06:39:27,250
Yeah, and then and then when we got you know, it was a huge deal and we got like the big pieces of naan bread

2347
06:39:27,810 --> 06:39:34,209
It was like they were it was awesome. I think like 10 loaves of naan bread

2348
06:39:34,770 --> 06:39:36,770
might actually be

2349
06:39:36,770 --> 06:39:39,009
More money than a like two or three pairs of shoes

2350
06:39:39,490 --> 06:39:50,400
How much is a pair of just just shitty sneakers? How much is a pair of just like I just go by

2351
06:39:50,799 --> 06:39:55,520
Here's another great thing about when we talk about the computer that's all the way to the left at best buy

2352
06:39:56,240 --> 06:40:05,860
What is the shoe all the way to the left at the shoe store? Well, what's like the dell in spiron of the shoe world?

2353
06:40:09,110 --> 06:40:20,759
20 at walmart like 15 like crocs new balance omega low

2354
06:40:22,049 --> 06:40:23,650
knockoff toms

2355
06:40:23,650 --> 06:40:35,810
Just go to pay less

2356
06:40:35,810 --> 06:40:37,810
these ones walmart images

2357
06:40:39,270 --> 06:40:42,150
Why is what what a weird what what is this fucked up website?

2358
06:40:42,790 --> 06:40:48,439
I5 dot walmart images dot ca. What the fuck is this?

2359
06:40:49,159 --> 06:40:57,669
Those are virus shoes

2360
06:41:02,450 --> 06:41:05,779
It's canadian

2361
06:41:05,779 --> 06:41:09,380
It's canadian walmart. Why is it walmart images?

2362
06:41:13,040 --> 06:41:14,720
These how much are these?

2363
06:41:14,720 --> 06:41:23,119
Are these expensive like what how much do these cost?

2364
06:41:23,759 --> 06:41:39,250
I mean they have max toe

2365
06:41:39,729 --> 06:41:41,569
Maximum toes in there

2366
06:41:41,569 --> 06:41:52,200
But does that mean you can fit 10 in there the maximum toes?

2367
06:41:52,919 --> 06:41:54,599
That you have are 10

2368
06:41:54,599 --> 06:41:55,880
is

2369
06:41:55,880 --> 06:42:00,040
Like 10 out of 10 toes is the maximum you fit could you fit both feet in there?

2370
06:42:00,840 --> 06:42:13,959
That's the max size for canadian

2371
06:42:14,599 --> 06:42:21,569
I lost my place

2372
06:42:21,569 --> 06:42:23,729
I lost my place in the bits

2373
06:42:25,680 --> 06:42:27,810
There they are

2374
06:42:27,810 --> 06:42:35,799
Uh, where were we right here? Hey manly leprechaun. Thanks for five dollars germa. This is my first time donating to a streamer

2375
06:42:36,520 --> 06:42:37,959
Glad you're my first

2376
06:42:37,959 --> 06:42:41,000
I don't know how often you make you take game recommendations from viewers

2377
06:42:41,560 --> 06:42:46,840
But you should play fossil fighters for the ds. It's a goofy fun and interesting game that could be entertaining to watch

2378
06:42:51,599 --> 06:42:53,599
What is it sloggers?

2379
06:42:55,810 --> 06:42:57,860
sloggers

2380
06:42:57,860 --> 06:43:03,360
I don't think I want to

2381
06:43:08,029 --> 06:43:10,790
Sloggers

2382
06:43:10,790 --> 06:43:13,490
Even saying that

2383
06:43:13,490 --> 06:43:15,490
Hey, what'd you get for a pair of shoes?

2384
06:43:15,970 --> 06:43:17,810
Ah, you know

2385
06:43:17,810 --> 06:43:20,840
sloggers

2386
06:43:20,840 --> 06:43:22,840
I got a good pair of sloggers

2387
06:43:25,009 --> 06:43:30,770
Why is why do I think when I think that I think when you step down the wet sound is heard like

2388
06:43:32,209 --> 06:43:40,610
Like they're already pre-wet they've been pre-wet like they dunked in water and held under there

2389
06:43:40,610 --> 06:43:44,229
So it gets into the foam and shit my sloggers

2390
06:43:44,790 --> 06:43:55,250
Wait, wait, what happened? Oh manly leprechaun, right?

2391
06:43:56,130 --> 06:43:58,130
fossil fighters for the ds

2392
06:43:58,209 --> 06:44:01,220
There's a lot of cool ds games

2393
06:44:04,180 --> 06:44:06,180
Although I don't know how well it would run on an emulator

2394
06:44:06,659 --> 06:44:10,259
If you even use those just want to put a word in for what I think would be an underrated gem

2395
06:44:10,900 --> 06:44:14,979
Either way keep up the good work and give auto a belly rub for me will do

2396
06:44:17,439 --> 06:44:22,400
Absolutely will

2397
06:44:22,400 --> 06:44:24,000
fossil fighters rocks

2398
06:44:24,000 --> 06:44:27,220
Maybe yeah. Yeah, let me see

2399
06:44:27,220 --> 06:44:33,959
That's just the name alone is making me go. Hmm. So you got me. You got me so far. Thanks for the five bucks, though

2400
06:44:36,049 --> 06:44:39,569
Atlantis thanks for five dollars. Fuck you chat. This game was fun. You guys are just mean

2401
06:44:40,369 --> 06:44:46,770

2404
06:45:02,290 --> 06:45:04,290
Chat is one person sad face

2405
06:45:11,240 --> 06:45:13,240

06:45:18,360 --> 06:45:24,049
Dollars a germa probably can't donate for a while, but i'm grateful for everything that you do. You've already given

2408
06:45:25,220 --> 06:45:29,029
Way more money that I could ever imagine somebody would ever give to an eclan

2409
06:45:30,310 --> 06:45:32,549
So thanks for the huge amount of money you've given

2410
06:45:33,860 --> 06:45:39,159
Appreciate it. Don't worry about it. Thanks for the 15 bucks

2411
06:45:39,639 --> 06:45:44,659
Thank you eyes melt of heart

2412
06:45:45,220 --> 06:45:50,400
For the three dollars. What did you smell? I don't know

2413
06:45:51,040 --> 06:45:53,569
Did I smell something? I don't know what it was

2414
06:45:54,049 --> 06:46:02,520
I don't know. Uh, thank you your cat for the 15 dollars your cat

2415
06:46:03,000 --> 06:46:09,090
Jerma, just want to say thanks for playing gotcha force. I played this game through more times than I can count as a kid

2416
06:46:09,729 --> 06:46:11,729
Always trying to get all the different borgs

2417
06:46:11,889 --> 06:46:20,040
May be happy to see it get some attention. Take care. Me too. It was a lot of fun. I loved it. It was great

2418
06:46:22,209 --> 06:46:25,860
Glad to give it some attention

2419
06:46:25,860 --> 06:46:34,470
I can't believe my cat donated. Yeah, it's kind of cool. Thanks for the 15 bucks

06:46:35,400 --> 06:46:37,080

Crispy wizard. Thanks for the five dollars jerma. I've been watching since jerma is mad part two

2422
06:46:41,319 --> 06:46:44,520
It's a long time this day. You're the only person I've ever watched on twitch

2423
06:46:45,000 --> 06:46:49,680
Your sense of humor is so unique and I never laugh so hard on a consistent basis. Keep up the good work

2424
06:46:50,240 --> 06:46:59,669
Looking forward to the easy bake oven stream me too. It should be fun. Thanks for uh, watching this guy

2425
06:47:00,389 --> 06:47:04,880
On the internet that long like 10 years ago

06:47:14,000 --> 06:47:19,439
Thank you neck wills for the 300 bits. Have you ever played a short hike?

2428
06:47:21,319 --> 06:47:25,720
Very relaxing 3d platform. You can knock out in a little over an hour. Thanks for being a funny streamer

2429
06:47:29,599 --> 06:47:55,139
What's a short hike short hike? This looks kind of cool

2430
06:48:00,340 --> 06:48:06,659
It's an hour

2431
06:48:06,659 --> 06:48:08,659
It's like 45 minutes

2432
06:48:08,659 --> 06:48:16,080
Maybe i'll play it. This is cool. Hey, it's it's a short hike

2433
06:48:17,090 --> 06:48:27,490
I would make it more than an hour

2434
06:48:27,490 --> 06:48:34,340
Could I is that even possible?

2435
06:48:34,500 --> 06:48:36,659
It's gonna be if it's a one-hour game. It'll be six

2436
06:48:43,029 --> 06:48:48,840
Just do the tuber joke. I don't know. Maybe i'll play it. This looks kind of cute. All right, put it on the list

2437
06:48:50,630 --> 06:48:54,279

06:49:00,930 --> 06:49:05,330
Jay browning. Thanks for the five dollars. Please play cubivore. That game's more expensive

2441
06:49:05,810 --> 06:49:10,689
Cubivore is like four hundred dollars. I think it's like the most expensive game cube game that I looked at

2442
06:49:14,450 --> 06:49:16,529
Gotcha forces 250 cubivore is like four

2443
06:49:18,310 --> 06:49:20,799
You would love cubivore

2444
06:49:20,799 --> 06:49:22,560
You can afford it lol

2445
06:49:22,560 --> 06:49:30,529
All right, but if I get made fun of for buying a 250 game

2446
06:49:31,090 --> 06:49:35,569
Double that and you know what just what should I just despite chat buy a 400 game?

2447
06:49:36,209 --> 06:49:48,150
Didn't somebody somebody gave me 250 to say to do that. I would only be i'm only playing myself here

2448
06:49:49,279 --> 06:49:50,560
Huh

2449
06:49:50,560 --> 06:49:54,799
Shows you chat. I spent four hundred dollars on a game cube game. Oh, that's I did that

2450
06:49:55,360 --> 06:49:56,799
I have to live with that

2451
06:49:56,799 --> 06:49:58,799
I have to buy that game for four hundred dollars

2452
06:49:58,959 --> 06:50:00,979
You don't have to do that

2453
06:50:00,979 --> 06:50:05,540
You could literally just open up a youtube like gameplay video of it right now and just watch it for like an hour and be like

2454
06:50:05,619 --> 06:50:08,150
Oh, this is stupid

2455
06:50:08,150 --> 06:50:19,040
Okay, just go watch a gameplay commentary on it

2456
06:50:19,840 --> 06:50:23,990
Yeah, I did look at it. It did look good though. We'll see

2457
06:50:24,709 --> 06:50:29,349

2475
06:52:05,080 --> 06:52:09,380

2476
06:52:09,959 --> 06:52:14,680
Incoming ha ha weed so sorry for that one, but one time some friends forced me to listen to neil

2477
06:52:15,380 --> 06:52:24,439
Cicierega's mouth moods for hours while I was way too high. It was really upsetting experience. It still haunts me. That's

2478
06:52:30,150 --> 06:52:33,830
Hey bug smoke. Thanks for 250 germa. Thanks for all the good content over the years

2479
06:52:34,310 --> 06:52:37,110
You know, I used to hate your tf2 videos

2480
06:52:37,990 --> 06:52:46,849
I used to hate your tf2 video phase before actually watching and realizing you were funny. I'm glad you glad you

2481
06:52:47,490 --> 06:52:50,049
Turned by the by by the way

2482
06:52:50,610 --> 06:52:55,810
If you ever play roblox on stream look up the roblox hellzone galleria 2.0 and play it

2483
06:52:59,069 --> 06:53:06,900
Gpm played it on stream and loved it. Did you give everyone a laugh? I've seen a lot of monkey s's. I'm sure that it's probably uh

2484
06:53:08,119 --> 06:53:11,119
a normal zone

2485
06:53:11,119 --> 06:53:21,779
But hey, thanks for watching used to hate the videos and now you like them appreciate it

2486
06:53:23,090 --> 06:53:25,090
Got him. He got infected by you

2487
06:53:28,580 --> 06:53:30,580
Bingo sunshine. Thanks for the 250

2488
06:53:31,220 --> 06:53:33,220
Remember these streams convinced me to pick up the game

2489
06:53:33,700 --> 06:53:40,689
Albeit through nefarious means because physical copies cost a hundred times more than this donation laughing my ass off

2490
06:53:40,930 --> 06:53:45,970
Anyway, the game is gorgeously emulated. It's entirely legal to own backup copies of games you already own

2491
06:53:46,049 --> 06:53:53,720
So would you consider emulation in the future for stuff? That's going to be a display piece. Anyway, that's the thought i've done it already

2492
06:53:54,119 --> 06:54:03,750
Uh, no more heroes one was played on the dolphin because no more heroes on the wii

2493
06:54:04,389 --> 06:54:07,590
Runs like an absolute trash can and I didn't want to put up with it

2494
06:54:07,590 --> 06:54:12,919
I didn't want to have you put up with it either. I admitted that you guys already knew that

2495
06:54:20,119 --> 06:54:21,799
I don't

2496
06:54:21,799 --> 06:54:23,560
look

2497
06:54:23,560 --> 06:54:25,639
The wii is right here

2498
06:54:25,639 --> 06:54:28,599
The game disc is right there and the wiimote's right here

2499
06:54:29,159 --> 06:54:35,939
What do you mean? I never told you yeah, I did

2500
06:54:37,119 --> 06:54:40,959
I talked about how it how it looks like I would ran like such dog shit that I had to emulate it

2501
06:54:44,919 --> 06:54:47,240
I've like held up the shit. I was like look look at me

2502
06:54:47,880 --> 06:55:05,250
Yeah, some games need it because they just don't run well and they don't pull a lot of some here's another thing some games do not

2503
06:55:05,810 --> 06:55:07,810
Pull through a capture card well either

2504
06:55:09,060 --> 06:55:12,259
at all

2505
06:55:12,259 --> 06:55:14,259
you've seen some of those games that are like

2506
06:55:18,900 --> 06:55:22,340
Some of them sound horrible being pulled through capture cards and being scaled

2507
06:55:24,479 --> 06:55:30,560
So it's only out of necessity and I I only if I own the games and own the consoles

2508
06:55:31,119 --> 06:55:32,720
I don't do it ever

2509
06:55:32,720 --> 06:55:43,700
I don't I don't do it. I don't I don't do this

2510
06:55:45,560 --> 06:55:47,560
Right dot dot dot, right

2511
06:55:52,439 --> 06:55:58,319
That's dumb

2512
06:56:02,880 --> 06:56:04,959
Right, right. Okay, let's keep going

2513
06:56:06,400 --> 06:56:08,770
Uh bingo sunshine. Yeah

2514
06:56:08,770 --> 06:56:13,889
Uh, I it is a thought on a lot of things and about I consider everything I I consider all options

2515
06:56:14,930 --> 06:56:16,290
maxi kaspersky

2516
06:56:16,290 --> 06:56:18,930
Thanks for the five dollars germa told me to never reverse

2517
06:56:19,409 --> 06:56:23,569
And i've been accelerating into this brick wall for 15 minutes. Please help. I'm going to run out of gas

2518
06:56:28,319 --> 06:56:31,279
Hey medhi merrin, thanks for the five dollars

2519
06:56:32,080 --> 06:56:34,740
Hello germa. I have a question

2520
06:56:34,740 --> 06:56:38,500
I'm quite a bit of a workaholic. I have adhd and I can't stop my head from thinking

2521
06:56:38,900 --> 06:56:40,900
So I try to think about productive things

2522
06:56:40,900 --> 06:56:43,060
Ever since quarantine there's nothing left for me to do

2523
06:56:43,619 --> 06:56:46,020
Done all my work and chores and despite there being nothing to do

2524
06:56:46,020 --> 06:56:48,500
I feel like i'm wasting away and failing at something that doesn't exist

2525
06:56:49,060 --> 06:56:51,220
Do you have any advice on how to teach myself to relax?

2526
06:56:51,860 --> 06:56:54,150
exercise

2527
06:56:54,150 --> 06:56:56,099
exercise

2528
06:56:56,099 --> 06:56:57,459
jogging

2529
06:56:57,459 --> 06:56:58,659
walking

2530
06:56:58,659 --> 06:57:03,250
Lifting and you can even do it. You can do it in your house. Do it in your room

2531
06:57:04,790 --> 06:57:06,389
push-ups sit-ups

2532
06:57:06,389 --> 06:57:15,200
That's not a bad idea

2533
06:57:15,200 --> 06:57:21,919
Yeah, do them right now

2534
06:57:21,919 --> 06:57:26,279
play an mmo

2535
06:57:29,479 --> 06:57:34,599
It's all it's also good to stay at least somewhat active in the middle of something like a quarantine like this

2536
06:57:35,400 --> 06:57:37,959
because

2537
06:57:37,959 --> 06:57:40,439
If you like for instance me right now

2538
06:57:41,159 --> 06:57:46,849
If I don't move around and I don't get up and do something or at least do like light exercise

2539
06:57:47,889 --> 06:57:49,889
You really got to keep yourself loose

2540
06:57:50,930 --> 06:57:57,540
And other people said do something creative start painting. I'm not sure where you are

2541
06:57:57,540 --> 06:58:02,819
I'm, not sure if you can still get like amazon deliveries or and if that's a possibility it should be

2542
06:58:03,779 --> 06:58:04,819
um

2543
06:58:04,819 --> 06:58:06,630
Order some paints

2544
06:58:06,630 --> 06:58:08,389
Had them just dropped at the door

2545
06:58:08,389 --> 06:58:11,889
Do some painting who cares have fun?

2546
06:58:16,790 --> 06:58:18,389
You could read

2547
06:58:18,389 --> 06:58:25,409
You could take a bath. I love baths. I've become a huge bath fan

2548
06:58:26,450 --> 06:58:28,450
I love just getting a light in a candle

2549
06:58:29,250 --> 06:58:31,080
Getting in the bath

2550
06:58:31,080 --> 06:58:33,080
You just sit there and you just take it in

2551
06:58:33,810 --> 06:58:35,810
Have some salts sprinkled

2552
06:58:36,369 --> 06:58:40,849
Lightly

2553
06:58:40,849 --> 06:58:46,770
I've been so into baths recently. I really have omega low rip the ipad just don't dunk your ipad in there

2554
06:58:48,159 --> 06:58:50,639
Don't just don't dunk your ipad in there. I lied about that

2555
06:58:51,439 --> 06:58:54,720
Like an hour ago don't do that. Don't don't like drop your ipad in the water

2556
06:58:54,720 --> 06:58:58,720
Like I like I made that whole thing up. So like don't like do that. It's wacky

2557
06:59:00,790 --> 06:59:09,569
No, it actually did happen. I wish you luck though in this

2558
06:59:10,290 --> 06:59:12,049
uh trying time

2559
06:59:12,049 --> 06:59:19,060
Thanks for the five dollars. Also. Thanks for five dollars. Dr. Clay. I have a dumb dad joke for you

2560
06:59:19,060 --> 06:59:20,659
What do you call a prank?

2561
06:59:20,659 --> 06:59:22,659
A jedi pulls using the force

2562
06:59:22,979 --> 06:59:25,799
It got you force event

2563
06:59:26,279 --> 06:59:27,560
You've been till tomorrow

2564
06:59:27,560 --> 06:59:36,389
So you have the pat upon stream?

2565
06:59:39,599 --> 06:59:41,599
It was cute. I liked it. Don't ban him

2566
06:59:43,509 --> 06:59:46,099
Just scare him

2567
06:59:46,099 --> 06:59:48,979
Hey, see hund. Thanks for the 300 bits jerma

2568
06:59:48,979 --> 06:59:52,180
I've been watching your contents the tf2 days and finally decided to watch your live streams

2569
06:59:53,250 --> 06:59:57,860
And not from the archives. I know that you've decided to move to the great city of las vegas

2570
06:59:58,580 --> 07:00:00,580
For someone who has boston

2571
07:00:01,139 --> 07:00:03,139
Is one of the top picks on where to move?

2572
07:00:03,380 --> 07:00:05,560
Do you have any suggestions on where to look?

2573
07:00:05,560 --> 07:00:13,200
Like where to live?

2574
07:00:13,200 --> 07:00:15,200
I mean if you can live in boston

2575
07:00:15,599 --> 07:00:23,939
There's a lot of awesome places in boston just you can just walk to everything. There's so many great bars and restaurants

2576
07:00:24,720 --> 07:00:28,549
And just stuff to do if you if you live like in city limits

2577
07:00:34,360 --> 07:00:40,180
Just go live in a bar

2578
07:00:40,180 --> 07:00:42,099
It is it is expensive

2579
07:00:42,099 --> 07:00:43,380
It is expensive

2580
07:00:43,380 --> 07:00:46,319
I only said just said go to hell why?

2581
07:00:46,799 --> 07:00:50,200
Ban that person till tomorrow's pat upon stream

2582
07:00:50,520 --> 07:01:00,400
Well, you don't know I talk about go live in hell. Oh, no, no, they're safe. That's fine. I would say if you can

2583
07:01:01,569 --> 07:01:04,580
In the city is is awesome

2584
07:01:04,580 --> 07:01:13,060
If you if you're able to afford it can get very expensive though safe for now

2585
07:01:20,520 --> 07:01:22,520
boston more like bossed out

2586
07:01:30,150 --> 07:01:35,110
Hey, johnny nice mountains. Thanks to 300 bits jerma. Are you familiar with the souls games? I've never heard of them

2587
07:01:35,669 --> 07:01:37,669
I have no idea what you're talking about

2588
07:01:38,439 --> 07:01:40,439
Don't get it. I don't know what that means. Is that like a meme?

2589
07:01:40,520 --> 07:01:44,520
Did I just say something I wasn't supposed to say did you give me is there like a like souls?

2590
07:01:45,240 --> 07:01:50,119
Like these nuts or something. I don't understand. I'm I'm I'm a funny joke, I guess

2591
07:01:53,380 --> 07:01:55,380
Hey peaceful. Haley. Thanks for 250

2592
07:01:56,680 --> 07:02:00,119
Just wanted to say I appreciate you and your community a lot. Everyone is so kind to me

2593
07:02:00,680 --> 07:02:03,159
Also, I said this years ago, but I still look up to you

2594
07:02:03,720 --> 07:02:07,240
And I do want to stream i'm just hard on myself and I want to do this more than anything

2595
07:02:07,880 --> 07:02:12,040
Thanks for being the thanks for thanks for the backing up into traffic advice don't do that

2596
07:02:23,430 --> 07:02:26,069
Streaming is fun streaming is really really really

2597
07:02:27,409 --> 07:02:32,610
Awesome, but you want to you gotta want to do it

2598
07:02:34,069 --> 07:02:35,830
You shouldn't have any pressure

2599
07:02:35,830 --> 07:02:37,540
to turn it on

2600
07:02:37,540 --> 07:02:39,540
and if your pressure is coming from

2601
07:02:40,000 --> 07:02:45,380
Needing to have to do it and I'd say that might be a problem

2602
07:02:48,560 --> 07:02:56,209
Wanting and needing you got to want to do it and just have fun doing it and just don't think about anything else

2603
07:02:59,919 --> 07:03:02,240
Not at all. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, I want that's good

2604
07:03:02,880 --> 07:03:12,020
Because the more that you start to need it the more you're going to give yourself

2605
07:03:13,220 --> 07:03:30,869
Potentially unrealistic things that you have to do. I hope that helps like eating a shoe

2606
07:03:31,509 --> 07:03:41,060
We don't talk about that. What about wanting to stop on the highway and that person and don't let them drive

2607
07:03:44,159 --> 07:03:46,479
All right. No, don't they're okay. They're asking a question

2608
07:03:47,119 --> 07:03:54,950
Hey bingo sunshine. Thanks for the 250 germa. The point was the games look and sound better emulated. Just emulate them

2609
07:03:55,430 --> 07:04:06,360
I mean, that's what I said, but I kind of I like putting the disk in and I like loading up the

2610
07:04:08,119 --> 07:04:13,479
Well, you know, I actually don't get to hear that I always mute that part

2611
07:04:14,880 --> 07:04:17,319
Got you

2612
07:04:17,319 --> 07:04:19,759
um, I like to bone stuff

2613
07:04:24,759 --> 07:04:26,200
I and and

2614
07:04:26,200 --> 07:04:29,560
It's it hasn't been that big of a problem

2615
07:04:31,599 --> 07:04:34,639
Plus like let's be honest. I know that

2616
07:04:35,360 --> 07:04:37,520
Look, it's anybody can just sit here and go

2617
07:04:38,240 --> 07:04:42,560
Just do it. Just do it. It's fine. Nobody cares. Twitch doesn't care

2618
07:04:43,040 --> 07:04:44,790
They don't care

2619
07:04:44,790 --> 07:04:46,950
But if somebody ever wanted to

2620
07:04:48,549 --> 07:04:51,029
It's still it's still

2621
07:04:52,580 --> 07:04:54,580
Technically illegal

2622
07:04:54,919 --> 07:04:58,689
You know what i'm saying? So like I have to just be I have to be careful

2623
07:04:58,770 --> 07:05:01,250
I don't want to be like yeah, everything I fucking own is pirated

2624
07:05:01,569 --> 07:05:06,130
Here's my folder with 300 gamecube games in it. I've didn't buy a fucking thing

2625
07:05:06,770 --> 07:05:09,090
Hi, i'm germa985 streamer with

2626
07:05:10,509 --> 07:05:14,049
6000 people watching don't you know look at this you can just get all this shit for free

2627
07:05:15,840 --> 07:05:19,759
I I gotta like be care. I don't want to I gotta be careful

2628
07:05:20,400 --> 07:05:29,459
You listen to copyrighted music. That's just as illegal dumbass

2629
07:05:33,360 --> 07:05:39,189
Um, that's no it's not

2630
07:05:40,500 --> 07:05:46,529
Playing a mighty mighty boss stone song from the youtube channel of mighty mighty boss stones

2631
07:05:48,290 --> 07:05:50,290
You can't go to youtube.com

2632
07:05:50,689 --> 07:05:52,689
And open up a window

2633
07:05:53,169 --> 07:06:04,209
With got your force in it

2634
07:06:04,209 --> 07:06:13,840
You can if they don't give you an easy legitimate way to get the game then fuck them

2635
07:06:15,759 --> 07:06:23,200
Yes, and I know I know I know but this this difference between listening to a song on stream

2636
07:06:23,919 --> 07:06:26,020
and having

2637
07:06:26,020 --> 07:06:27,700
thousands of dollars

2638
07:06:27,700 --> 07:06:30,259
In game products downloaded to my hard drive

2639
07:06:30,900 --> 07:06:35,750
That I did not pay for

2640
07:06:35,750 --> 07:06:46,880
Even if it's not available. I just I just have to be careful. I just laughed so hard. My parents probably woke up

2641
07:06:52,369 --> 07:07:10,340
Sure roger that mr boomer and like like nintendo games wasn't that like doesn't it isn't nintendo?

2642
07:07:11,299 --> 07:07:13,380
Like do not fucking do that

2643
07:07:14,919 --> 07:07:19,720
Didn't they they've removed all that they cease and desist fucking people hosting that shit all the time

2644
07:07:20,279 --> 07:07:30,040
It's been seven hours. What happened to oh, I can't stream for more than four hours

2645
07:07:30,279 --> 07:07:35,250
I had to be gotcha force

2646
07:07:35,250 --> 07:07:39,729
And I mean the stream has been over for like an hour or two. He's been hanging out

2647
07:07:40,290 --> 07:07:44,369
But I did I did say that I did say I didn't want to go more than six seven hours

2648
07:07:45,569 --> 07:07:47,729
I said no, I did say that sometimes

2649
07:07:48,290 --> 07:07:53,400
Needing to finish stuff I I would be able to it'd be okay, but it's primarily to

2650
07:07:54,520 --> 07:08:00,680
Avoid my it just completely give me a hard wall to not have like eight plus hour streams ever again

2651
07:08:01,080 --> 07:08:12,799
The same nintendo sells shitty ports of super mario world on every console for 20 dollars

2652
07:08:13,360 --> 07:08:16,549
Yeah, but they still sell it. That's the point

2653
07:08:19,220 --> 07:08:22,419
Look, i'm not gonna i'm not gonna sit here and like argue any like

2654
07:08:23,409 --> 07:08:29,569
Copyright they deserve to charge that they don't fuck those companies like i've used emulators on this stream. You've seen it

2655
07:08:30,130 --> 07:08:33,330
And I probably will continue to do so

2656
07:08:34,979 --> 07:08:36,979
If I've you know find it necessary

2657
07:08:40,200 --> 07:08:50,689
I mean what what you didn't buy the dos games monkey ass

2658
07:08:52,689 --> 07:08:59,729
Yeah, but the dos games are like archived into fucking they're like that archive.org is like the public domain of all things

2659
07:09:07,750 --> 07:09:09,750
It's an abandonware. Yeah

2660
07:09:11,520 --> 07:09:13,520
playing abandonware versus

2661
07:09:13,919 --> 07:09:16,880
Capcom still owns the rights to beautiful joe

2662
07:09:20,279 --> 07:09:24,279
Like capcom didn't go, you know, hey, you know what beautiful joe is abandonware now

2663
07:09:25,060 --> 07:09:27,060
No, they have that shit under lock and key

2664
07:09:27,220 --> 07:09:36,229
But they aren't doing anything with it

2665
07:09:36,229 --> 07:09:41,349
Uh, welcome to my argument for uh, why won't gino just be added as a nintendo character?

2666
07:09:41,830 --> 07:09:54,369
There's been there's been like three or four cases where nintendo employees have been like yeah, that's a cool character

2667
07:09:54,450 --> 07:09:58,450
Maybe we have to be fun. Wow, I think oh gino's really cool. Yeah

2668
07:09:59,090 --> 07:10:01,349
He's just locked in a cage

2669
07:10:01,349 --> 07:10:04,130
at square enix

2670
07:10:04,130 --> 07:10:11,909
And then hey square enix. You ever gonna use that character? Nope. Can I use that character? Nope

2671
07:10:15,299 --> 07:10:17,299
I they're good doing business with you

2672
07:10:17,540 --> 07:10:24,840
But that happens a lot

2673
07:10:24,840 --> 07:10:33,919
Long story short is that I just I just gotta be careful whether I use it or don't use it

2674
07:10:34,240 --> 07:10:40,159
I know like I know everyone's saying this person does it this person does I know and that's all right. I do too

2675
07:10:40,639 --> 07:10:50,880
We say hi to peaches. Hey peaches

2676
07:10:51,439 --> 07:10:58,240
Welcome to the stream

Me and pre-stream chat tomorrow are going to decide

2683
07:11:22,400 --> 07:11:24,400
The thing I was going to tell you

2684
07:11:24,479 --> 07:11:32,080
Okay, this is really really really deep heavy heavy spoiler heavy. No, no, no

I'm gonna do this one day. No, you don't get i'm sorry

2686
07:11:36,639 --> 07:11:38,819
I like to put that but it's a big spoiler

2687
07:11:42,240 --> 07:11:48,720
No, I like hate that. Oh, I hate like I don't want to type like the fucking like a huge boy. I don't I hate that

2688
07:11:50,159 --> 07:11:52,159
Okay, it looks like something

2689
07:11:52,400 --> 07:11:54,400
Oh, I can't

2690
07:11:54,479 --> 07:11:57,119
I don't like doing that because people but you could like clip me saying this

2691
07:11:58,159 --> 07:12:00,159
Just like give it to somebody and be like, hey look

2692
07:12:00,479 --> 07:12:16,720
And they'll click it and be like thanks. Uh, okay. Let me just finish the bits. Hey j cup brah

2693
07:12:17,040 --> 07:12:19,360
Thanks for the 300 bits germa. I am a newer viewer

2694
07:12:20,080 --> 07:12:22,080
Watching for about three months. Well, welcome to the channel

2695
07:12:23,439 --> 07:12:26,880
I thought it was pretty cool to see a streamer who used to live in my hometown. You're a funny dude

2696
07:12:27,520 --> 07:12:30,880
And i'm glad to watch some more in the future any advice on starting a youtube channel

2697
07:12:31,599 --> 07:12:33,599
Just go just do it

2698
07:12:33,919 --> 07:12:35,360
See what happens

2699
07:12:35,360 --> 07:12:37,349
But I did

2700
07:12:37,349 --> 07:12:42,840
See what happens?

2701
07:12:42,840 --> 07:12:46,840
No, that the the the just do it forehead is actual advice for this

2702
07:12:52,819 --> 07:12:54,819
Started 10 years ago

2703
07:13:03,200 --> 07:13:04,950
true

2704
07:13:04,950 --> 07:13:06,389
true, I

2705
07:13:06,389 --> 07:13:13,520
The best advice you give to anybody starting any new creative endeavor

2706
07:13:16,639 --> 07:13:18,000
Go for it

2707
07:13:18,000 --> 07:13:19,840
Do it as best as you can

2708
07:13:19,840 --> 07:13:21,939
And try to set realistic expectations

2709
07:13:25,110 --> 07:13:29,430
Do it for fun. Do it because you like it do it because you want to tell something do because you want to show something

2710
07:13:31,159 --> 07:13:33,459
Same advice I would give for anything

2711
07:13:33,540 --> 07:13:38,259
Don't do something because you feel like you have to do it do it because you want to do it and do it as best

2712
07:13:38,340 --> 07:13:39,540
As you can

2713
07:13:39,540 --> 07:13:44,340
If something good happens if you get some viewers then fucking awesome. Keep going keep doing it

2714
07:13:44,979 --> 07:13:46,979
If you don't get any viewers right at the bat

2715
07:13:47,540 --> 07:13:49,509
Keep going

2716
07:13:49,509 --> 07:13:51,959
Just keep doing it

2717
07:13:51,959 --> 07:13:56,919
And then find out over the months coming weeks and months if it's something that you actually wanted to do

2718
07:13:57,400 --> 07:14:05,200
You've said this advice six times today

2719
07:14:05,599 --> 07:14:07,599
While it was asked at six separate times

2720
07:14:08,319 --> 07:14:10,319
And people might not be here. They might have left

2721
07:14:10,880 --> 07:14:13,569
It's homework advice

2722
07:14:19,430 --> 07:14:25,270
Don't take youtuber advice from this xtuber. That's another thing. I don't know the game at all and I never did

2723
07:14:28,549 --> 07:14:32,229
I didn't know I you think I knew what I was fucking doing

2724
07:14:33,779 --> 07:14:37,060
When it came to like how to make it big on youtube

2725
07:14:39,840 --> 07:14:42,880
I like ran somebody over with a car in gta and laughed at it

2726
07:14:44,209 --> 07:14:46,209
What happened? How did I get here?

2727
07:14:55,650 --> 07:14:57,700
true

2728
07:14:57,700 --> 07:15:03,380
Now I obviously I put a lot of work into that channel and a lot of stuff that I really cared about

2729
07:15:03,860 --> 07:15:09,779
That's a jokey little like hey, it's a funny thing. I spent a lot of work. I spent a lot of time on that channel

2730
07:15:10,340 --> 07:15:14,689
In quotes work. Are you supposed to be banned?

2731
07:15:15,490 --> 07:15:20,130
Wait, i'm not supposed to read what you say. You don't put that uh, ban that person until tomorrow's pad upon stream

2732
07:15:21,009 --> 07:15:23,009
And I actually mean that this time

2733
07:15:24,080 --> 07:15:28,799
No, I'm not actually yeah. No. Yeah, i'm not supposed to read what you say. That's i'm not supposed to read you

2734
07:15:29,360 --> 07:15:31,360
Now you've gone till tomorrow's pad upon stream

2735
07:15:32,689 --> 07:15:37,490
Yep, i'm about to turn the stream off and now i'm not yep. You're tomorrow. You're not gonna see me until tomorrow

2736
07:15:38,369 --> 07:15:46,470
What was I talking about? Oh, yeah

2737
07:15:48,450 --> 07:15:52,849
I would just get ideas and do them and if people thought they were funny or they liked them then they did and if they

2738
07:15:52,849 --> 07:15:54,849
Didn't then they didn't and I just kept doing them

2739
07:15:56,240 --> 07:15:58,720
There's a shit load of channels that people like didn't think were very good

2740
07:15:59,520 --> 07:16:00,880
That's okay

2741
07:16:00,880 --> 07:16:02,880
I learned and I tried to make them better

2742
07:16:04,180 --> 07:16:06,979
There are videos people thought were some of the best things that i've ever done

2743
07:16:07,619 --> 07:16:12,500
You learn you say okay. What was what did that work? Let me do more of that. Let me try some more of that

2744
07:16:16,159 --> 07:16:18,400
How why did you just hit me?

2745
07:16:19,840 --> 07:16:24,880
But um incredibly long-winded word fucking soup I was going to word soup after like six or seven hours

2746
07:16:26,200 --> 07:16:27,000
um

2747
07:16:27,000 --> 07:16:32,119
Do it because you want to not because you need to that's like the best advice I can give to anybody doing anything creatively

2748
07:16:33,080 --> 07:16:39,639

2750
07:16:46,400 --> 07:16:50,799
Also, there exists toys in manga and a manga series, but they're all extremely hard to find

2751
07:16:51,439 --> 07:16:53,119
Anyways, keep it up

Only story mode unlocks new borgs and there are camera problems

2771
07:18:06,770 --> 07:18:09,569
