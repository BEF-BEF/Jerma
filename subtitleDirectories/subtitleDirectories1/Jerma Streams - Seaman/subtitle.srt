1
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:10,759
Hello. Good afternoon. And for some of you, good evening. Good morrow, maybe for a handful of you

2
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:24,149
as well. Yeah, uh, stream was scheduled for tomorrow, but like all things, sometimes you can

3
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:33,219
move stuff around and decided I was gonna stream today. Would you look at that? Nice EU time.

4
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:42,200
Uh, four, let's see, five, six, three, like fifty, three, thirty, three, zero, four, five, six, six, seven, eight,

5
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:54,619
nine, ten, eleven. It's like 1130 EU, right? Nice game name that I didn't name it. All right,

6
00:00:54,619 --> 00:01:02,280
daylight savings time too. I hate that. There's nothing worse than sitting on your computer,

7
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:09,719
just getting shit done. And it's you're up a little too late and you know that. And it's

8
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:16,439
1230 AM, one AM. And you're like, I still, it's all right. I still get to one AM. You go up to

9
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:26,200
go to the bathroom. You come back and all of a sudden it's three AM. What, how, what happened?

10
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:35,159
No, this is not fair. This is not fair at all. I gotta, I have to, no, I have work to do. And

11
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,359
then you have to force yourself to go to sleep. And that sucks always because you're sitting there

12
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:45,480
lying like toy soldier style in the bed, closing your eyes, squeezing them, going like,

13
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:52,790
fuck daylight savings time. Oh, I'm, I'm well aware, especially for school too.

14
00:01:53,590 --> 00:02:04,840
When I was in college, hated it. It was the worst thing ever. You'd be sitting there looking at

15
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,319
your phone or something or hanging out on your computer and it would just teleport an hour

16
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:15,460
forward. And it just screws you up for like a week. But regardless, happy daylight savings.

17
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:29,419
Today we're going to play Seaman. Does the microphone work? I don't know because,

18
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:35,639
well, it knows it exists. I loaded the game up and it said, please put, uh, this is Leonard

19
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:42,439
Nimoy, by the way, is the voice of Seaman and the narrator as well. So it did recognize that

20
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:48,330
it was in there. I don't know if it works because I really didn't want to jump into it unless we

21
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:57,319
were all here. And that's five computer subs from Hot Take Alert. Thanks for the five subs,

22
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:03,900
Hot Take. So this is what we're doing today. I don't know how long this is going to be.

23
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:13,060
We'll find out. I'm ready to close the lid and get going. I bought a counterfeit Seaman mic.

24
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,849
I don't think that's possible. Is that possible? You can't buy a fake one. Can you?

25
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:26,780
I don't think you can. Let's close the lid. Let me get this over here.

26
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:35,750
Hey, you've seen that familiar face before, haven't you? That is the Dreamcast. All right.

27
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:43,139
Seaman, here we go. So just to give everybody a little intro here as to what the fuck is even

28
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:50,659
going on. This, this is the Dreamcast controller as you see, right? Only difference is this time

29
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:57,479
there's a little thing on it. This thing right here. I have to speak into this to talk to the

30
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:05,620
Seaman. And I owned this game when I was younger, but I was too young to understand what the fuck

31
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,860
was going on and how I was supposed to play it in the first place. So I got bored because

32
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,939
I think I said like, hello, three or four times and realized it wasn't like a fun,

33
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:19,620
like welcome to the laboratory of Jean Paul Gasset. Hold on. You'll witness before you a

34
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:28,019
phenomenon like no other. A man of the sea. Seaman, this legendary creature will be dependent on you

35
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:37,379
for his life's blood. You'll begin right here in Gasset's laboratory. What awaits you within?

36
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:45,139
You have no idea what Seaman is or how it evolves. This is something you must find out for yourself

37
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:52,579
as there's little documentation to help you on your way. My name is Leonard Nimoy and I will be

38
00:04:52,579 --> 00:05:00,980
your guide. Well, this is your first day with the Seaman kit. Your first step will involve preparing

39
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:06,899
the tank for Seaman's arrival. Adjust the tank settings to be an adequate temperature with

40
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:14,420
sufficient oxygen. While adjusting, keep in mind that blue is the color of the sea and thus an

41
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:21,939
appropriate color for the care of Seaman. Then take the egg from the storage matrix and place it in the

42
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:27,300
tank. Okay. The water's temperature is key to the hatching of the egg. So we have to hatch an egg

43
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,500
first. Once hatched, the nautilus will play a very important role in Seaman's development.

44
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:41,160
Each time you visit this laboratory, I'll be here to offer advice and guidance. If you tire of my

45
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,560
voice... By the way, it's kind of hard to pay attention because of the fucking deli slicer over

46
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:52,360
here next to me. Very well. I completely forgot about the deli slicer. As you see, press start.

47
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:04,550
What's he saying? Oh, look at this calm game where you make a creature. That's like all I

48
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,709
hear over here and I buried this. This is not even on my desk. The Dreamcast is over here,

49
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:18,220
down on the ground. Does it give a turn of garbage disposal on with a fork in it? That's what it

50
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:27,290
sounds like when you play with the Dreamcast. Don't be careful, by the way. That's dangerous.

51
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:34,629
Don't even use your garbage disposal. It's fucking scary. Think of how many horror movies you've

52
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:42,230
seen where the guy reaches in and... Don't ever have a garbage disposal. Just clean your plate

53
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:54,379
in the trash. All right. So this is Seaman. We have our hand here. I think we have to get the

54
00:06:54,379 --> 00:07:08,810
temperature and the temperature has to be raised. Turn the lights on. Okay, here we go. So left

55
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:18,790
trigger. Here's the egg. Food pellets. We have to feed it. Use voice. There's nothing here to use my

56
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:27,699
voice yet. Hello? No, there's no animal. This is the thing that they tell you not to do at every pet

57
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:39,029
store. All right, let's put the egg. I need lights. The nautilus, right? Use the nautilus.

58
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:48,649
There's a camera. This is the one problem with not having any manual to know. Wait a minute,

59
00:07:48,649 --> 00:08:06,730
I do have the manual. Got it. Welcome to Dr. Gassa's live laboratory. Thank you for purchasing

60
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:12,009
the Seaman kit. Please note this software is designed only for use with the Dreamcast

61
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:16,009
console. Do not put this in a PlayStation. Why would you do that? This package contains

62
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:24,470
a Seaman habitat and one Seaman egg. Thank God I have this. Seriously. To begin with, let's learn

63
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:30,069
a bit about Seaman, shall we? Historical references to Seaman first appeared in the spoken folklore of

64
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:34,629
ancient Egypt, passed down from generation to generation. Until recently, it was assumed that

65
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:38,710
the Seaman creature did not actually exist, similar to many other mythical creatures of ancient

66
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:47,049
Egypt. However, in 1997, the discovery of a live Seaman in the Egyptian city of old Alexandria

67
00:08:47,049 --> 00:08:55,669
disproved this assumption, and Seaman can't be known as the world over. While the originally

68
00:08:55,669 --> 00:09:02,899
discovered Seaman specimen died shortly after being captured, its remains were quickly rushed

69
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:09,700
to the foremost biologist research institute in France, where a number of eggs were discovered

70
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:16,519
inside its body. We at Vivarium were then able to assist in the endeavor by covering the research

71
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:21,159
and development costs in return for the sole distribution of rights that have enabled us to

72
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:28,419
this product to you. There he is.

73
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,909
No, that's not what it says.

74
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:52,070
Welcome. Okay. A memory card is required.

75
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:17,909
Should I read this whole thing? I mean, look, this was like a fucking hundred bucks.

76
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:25,269
I'm reading the whole thing. It was 80 fucking bucks for this microphone, and the disc was like

77
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:30,460
28. I'm reading it. I'm milking this stream for all it's got.

78
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:47,580
Dr. Jean-Paul Gasset. Dr. Gasset was a member of a special team of French biologists

79
00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:53,340
dispatched to Egypt by the French government in the 1930s when he discovered references to a

80
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:59,820
creature dubbed the Omnipotent Messenger of the Gods. Among ruins of the third dynasty,

81
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,340
he became determined to pursue this line of research and unravel the mystery.

82
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:11,259
In March of 1932 in the city of Alexandria, Dr. Gasset happened to meet up with a local resident

83
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:16,620
who had caught a seaman while fishing. Dr. Gasset obtained a sample of some of the eggs,

84
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,659
which he carried back with him to France. When Dr. Gasset returned, he immediately attempted to

85
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:29,340
raise the seaman eggs in his Parisian laboratory, but unfortunately in the midst of his experiment,

86
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:37,100
the seaman died. Dead. The seaman died. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Gasset published a detailed thesis

87
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:43,080
of his work. He didn't do very well. He brought, you put him in a backpack and they died.

88
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:51,399
You're gonna write about it now? Oh, I'm not like, oh let me, hold on a minute there. There we go.

89
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:57,669
Uh, let's see. However, after leading academics of the day,

90
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:04,070
dismissed the young scholar's work as a publicity stunt and without the proper evidence,

91
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:09,190
e.g. a living specimen. To support his theories, his work was shunned and no one believed him.

92
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:18,460
Dr. Gasset's hypothesis suggested that seaman was perhaps responsible for transferring knowledge

93
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:26,279
that proliferated during the third dynasty across oceans to other lands. This theory

94
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:32,919
eventually became the basis for it. Anthro bioarchaeology, a highly valued field of study

95
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:38,730
today. Soon after the publication of his thesis, Dr. Gasset was dismissed from his post. He then

96
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:43,370
disappeared for quite some time. Recently a dire, I don't know, I don't need to read the rest. He

97
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:48,009
like genetically put his fucking brain in the fish and that's who you talk to. I figured it out.

98
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:57,059
He like, he is the fish. Guaranteed. Continued research to unravel the details of seaman's

99
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:02,419
evolution. For further details kindly refer to the following website. I don't think this website

100
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:11,669
still works. It's www.meetseaman.com. I would highly recommend you don't do that website considering

101
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:17,289
the potential pornographic consequences because it definitely doesn't exist anymore.

102
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,690
All right, here we go. Before starting a game, this is the first things first reality check.

103
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:28,940
Seaman is a one player game. So once you begin raising seaman, you're expected to assume complete

104
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,779
responsibility for the care and upbringing of a living breathing creature. So before you begin

105
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:37,659
with the initial setup procedure, you are strongly recommended to double check with yourself that you

106
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:48,419
are mentally prepared to assume this important responsibility. It's not like buying it. It's not

107
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:55,690
like owning a dog or cat. This is the conversation. Okay, this is the mom. This booklet is the mom and

108
00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:01,850
I'm the kid and I just said I wanted a kitty and it's given me the whole, okay, well remember

109
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,929
you've got to take care of this cat. Are you, are you ready for that? You have to clean its

110
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:11,960
litter box and it's like, yeah, yeah, I will. God. The first step you must take in preparation

111
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,200
is set up with the required equipment. At this time, should you experience any tension related

112
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:22,120
symptoms such as heart palpitations, perspiration, etc. Resulting from the sheer weight of the

113
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:30,059
responsibility for rearing a seaman. You may wish to loosen up a bit by stretching or taking a bit

114
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:35,879
of exercise. Once you are sufficiently relaxed, you are ready to begin. Do not turn the power of

115
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:54,519
the dream cast on yet. Says it right there. Do you see? Do not turn the power of the dream cast on.

116
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:03,419
Whatever, we already did it. It's too late. Okay, got the memory card in, got the micro. As seaman

117
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:11,659
matures, there will come a time when it will begin to converse with you. A microphone has been

118
00:15:11,659 --> 00:15:17,340
included in this package for the express purposes of speaking to your seaman. Whenever you wish to

119
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,860
play with your seaman, always be sure to insert the microphone into expansion socket two.

120
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,700
No, the VMU must be inserted into expansion socket one. The seaman software will not run

121
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,500
if these two devices are not correctly inserted in the right slots. All right, so how do I play?

122
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:41,830
Got it. Creating a seaman habitat. Put that down for now. Oh, don't break. Just buy the domain

123
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:55,240
already. Just buy, wait, buy the seaman domain? Buy the seaman domain and just have it be a

124
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:14,389
fucking picture of this. How much is that? No, I'm not doing that shit. All right, maybe I'll do it.

125
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:28,470
All right, creating a seaman habitat. Memory card file, got it. Yep, okay, let's figure this out.

126
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:38,279
Here we go. Do you see what that says? That says mental preparation. Mental preparation.

127
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:51,750
The most fundamental requirement for successfully raising seaman is daily care and maintenance.

128
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,559
At the very least, you are kindly requested to attend to various custodial tasks such as providing

129
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:06,039
oxygen, water, food, cleaning, etc. on a daily basis, just as with a daily exercise program.

130
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:11,559
It is important that you participate each and every day without fail. This concept is a

131
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:17,940
prerequisite for being a guardian to seaman. Seaman is a game in which you will experience

132
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:23,460
the growth of a living being. You will witness the drama of life over an extended period of time.

133
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:30,170
Therefore, you do not expect an experience similar to any other games in which clearly defined

134
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:40,619
events happen each time you play. This is like 1998. They figured this out.

135
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:47,269
Neopets figured this out in like 2006, don't worry. This is not the type of game in which

136
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:52,710
one can spend several hours in one sitting and expect to experience vast amounts of action or

137
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:59,420
change. As with life itself, change only occurs over time and even then slowly. Change is only

138
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:07,019
evident through the accumulation of experience over time, aka do not stream this game. You wasted

139
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:12,460
a hundred dollars, idiot. Enjoy communicating with seaman while you attend to these daily

140
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:17,900
maintenance tasks. Tap on the glass of the aquarium to get its attention. Use the microphone to greet

141
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,579
and converse as well as other methods you will discover in order to express your affection to

142
00:18:21,579 --> 00:18:28,940
it. This is paramount to ensuring the successful growth and development of your seaman. As seaman

143
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,700
matures and reaches a certain level of development, recognition will increase and it will begin

144
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:44,140
conversing with you. I have to stream this every day. A daily stream. Seaman's development will

145
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:48,859
accelerate when in good humor. The only way to ensure seaman is kept in good humor is to take

146
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:55,059
adequate care of it daily without fail while constantly providing loving affection. Although

147
00:18:55,059 --> 00:19:01,880
raising seaman does require a bit of perseverance, it is a bit like writing in a diary. Just set the

148
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:15,960
date forward one day. Just cheat. Should I just make my internal clock like 2040? No, I have to

149
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,440
go every day. I'm gonna have to turn off the console and go and change the clock every day.

150
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,279
We're gonna we're gonna be like four weeks. Oh this is gonna be a pain in the ass.

151
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:33,539
Although raising seaman does require a bit of perseverance, it is a bit like writing in a

152
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:39,539
diary. Something you need to persist in doing on a daily basis. By doing so, you will find yourself

153
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:44,019
experiencing a grand drama the likes of which have yet been rendered possible by even the most

154
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:53,339
realistic of computer or console games. For those of you with time to spare, one highly recommended

155
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:59,099
and interesting method for enjoying your time with seaman is to darken the lights into your room and

156
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:07,299
simply vegetate while watching your seaman go about daily life. Similar to a typical aquarium,

157
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:15,579
what about working or school? This is encouraging you to literally not go to work,

158
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:27,130
not go to school, and sit there and vegetate it says all day. Seaman will provide completely

159
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:32,089
different and ever-changing scenery for your television set and for as long as seaman lives

160
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:48,069
the show will go on. Let's begin. That's so that's weird. Were you expected just to have it on,

161
00:20:48,069 --> 00:20:53,660
turned on all day? Here we go. Transfer the egg into the tank. All right, I'm ready.

162
00:20:54,460 --> 00:21:00,549
Here we go. Subsequent, we've got here are the operations. Here we go. Ready? This is if I if I

163
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:06,309
didn't have this book, I would be fucked. Thank God the people that I bought this from. It wasn't

164
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:20,920
just like a jewel case. This game sounds like shitty SCP. Relax. All right, operation day one.

165
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:27,259
I'm ready. Hello. Once again, you are urged to review the setup or procedure. Yeah, I know how

166
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:37,289
to do that. Okay, press the open button on your Dreamcast to open the disk door. No, this is how

167
00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:43,099
to put the disk in. Please. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Press the start button on the Dreamcast

168
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:50,150
controller to display the raising habitat. In the beginning, this will be an aquarium. The very first

169
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:58,819
thing you must do is place the seaman egg into the tank. L trigger to toggle the display over

170
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:04,500
the storage matrix. The milky white object located in the top of the storage is the seaman egg.

171
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:16,259
Use the analog thumb pad to select the egg. Okay, so I got I've got two here. All right. Yeah,

172
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:21,460
I know. I know. I know. I know what it said. I heard it too, but I just swallowed it. Okay.

173
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:58,500
I like no, no, no. I just didn't react to it. And that's like, oh, wow. I said that on purpose,

174
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:07,059
right? That's like has to be what it was. Nobody would say that unless they said it on purpose.

175
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:20,970
Like, absolutely not. God damn it. What a fucking idiot. Anyways, first transfer the egg into the

176
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:41,220
tank. Who gives a shit? I'll be fine. So while use the analog thumb pad to select the egg,

177
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:58,490
and while pressing and holding X, press and hold the trigger to grab the egg. Okay, I got it. If

178
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:02,170
you are successful, you should see the egg displayed on the clipboard in the lower right

179
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:06,970
corner of the screen. In this state, press L again to toggle the display over the aquarium.

180
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:15,660
Ooh, shit. So you have to hold it the whole time. So we go like this, right trigger, left,

181
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:23,859
and now we're over here. Next, let go of X and R to release the egg into the tank. This the clipboard

182
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:28,259
will disappear and the egg will be visible in the tank. This process is used when moving items from

183
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:33,220
display to display. Whenever you grasp an item, it will appear on the clipboard. If you release

184
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,819
the item, let go of X and or R before switching to the display in which to release the item,

185
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:51,240
the item will return to the original location. So let go. Where is it? Did I just drop it on the

186
00:24:51,240 --> 00:25:11,180
ground? How do I zoom out? How do I like zoom the camera out? Where's the egg? When continuing

187
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:21,319
from, please insert the memory card into... How do I turn the lights on? This is not dead already.

188
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:32,730
How do I turn on the lights? Would you like to save and end the session? No, not yet. Okay,

189
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:41,460
then it says subsequent operation. All right. When continuing from previously saved file,

190
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:48,660
only one seamen habitat is able to be created on a VMU. Therefore file selection, yeah, yeah, yeah.

191
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:52,819
Whenever the start screen is displayed, there will be a short narration that reports on the

192
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:58,019
current status of your seamen's development and provides a brief explanation of what has occurred

193
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:04,740
previously, as there are often important hints and tips on how to proceed offered during this

194
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:11,160
narration. It is recommended that you listen to it carefully every single day. If the mushrooms

195
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:20,359
do not evolve within a few days of their hatching, they will die. How do I turn the lights on?

196
00:26:22,329 --> 00:26:26,730
Position the hand over the nautilus at the bottom of the tank and press R to patiently tap it.

197
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:32,890
The mushroomers will float towards the nautilus and be eaten. Do not be alarmed by this behavior

198
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:36,170
and continue on as normal. Once the nautilus has consumed at least four

199
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:40,250
mushroomers, it will begin to undergo a transformation, so observe it carefully.

200
00:26:41,049 --> 00:27:06,789
How do I turn on the lights? How do you turn on the lights? Before turning on the Dreamcast,

201
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:14,220
flip the light switch. Controls, yeah, I'm looking at it right now.

202
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:19,660
Toggle, once displayed, toggle between each function. Use the D-pad to operate the various

203
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:41,049
devices that control the habitat. Okay, so we got heater, air, light. Oh, okay, where's the egg?

204
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:51,559
Press down to hide the habitat panel. So what do I need to do for heat? How do I clean the tank?

205
00:27:52,359 --> 00:28:13,349
How do I give the, how do I give mushrooms to the thing? Tap it, right? Turn on the heat.

206
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:20,710
Leonard didn't tell me that. Hold on. Would you like to save and end the session? It didn't tell

207
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:34,470
me what heat I needed to put it to. How to interact with a flick seaman. Caring for your seaman.

208
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:47,099
I just had to keep reading, okay? Relax. Use the D-pad to operate the devices on the habitat

209
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:51,420
operation panel. Because the analog design for this device is old-fashioned,

210
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,940
you are only able to perform operations such as raising the temperature or increasing the

211
00:28:54,940 --> 00:29:00,950
oxygen level of the habitat. For the duration, you press the relevant button. Once you've released

212
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,309
the button, the temperature will begin to decrease and the oxygen to dissipate with the

213
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:20,819
passage of time. Maybe I haven't prepared myself mentally for it. I am absolutely prepared mentally

214
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:30,089
for it. Okay. Granted, the system used to operate requires far more work than would a fully automated

215
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:34,490
digital habitat system, but let us not forget the benefits that this analog style system provides.

216
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:39,539
Perhaps such work will be useful in teaching you a concept that is often forgotten in this

217
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:45,140
fully automated society we live in. Mainly that the first step towards conveying true affection

218
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:50,099
for another is through constant attention and care. Not through Twitter, not through Facebook,

219
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:54,900
not through Instagram. Delete them. You don't need them. You don't even have to use them.

220
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:59,460
Get rid of your Facebook. Leonard Nimoy told you fucking 20 years ago this was going to happen.

221
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:14,039
Don't use it anymore. Go outside. Go outside and at least once a week. Leonard Nimoy warned us about

222
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:19,509
this. It is necessary to maintain appropriate levels of temperature, oxygen, etc. in order to

223
00:30:19,509 --> 00:30:24,150
provide semen with a suitable living environment. Therefore, it is necessary for you to adjust these

224
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:30,390
levels as required to display the habitat operation panel on the screen. The functions that are

225
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:33,670
available for use at the current stage of your semen development will appear on the panel.

226
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:38,069
Press this way or that way to toggle between the available functions and then press

227
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:42,710
that way or this way to activate the selected function to hide the habitat updation panel.

228
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:50,099
Press okay. Display the habitat operation panel and toggle until the word light appears.

229
00:30:50,660 --> 00:31:05,980
Press. I thought that was a house. I was like where's the home button? You see that? I was

230
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:17,740
like home. It's up. It is recommended that normally you keep the light on at the brightest setting

231
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:22,220
in order to observe semen properly. All right. Fucking heater. Display the habitat operation

232
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:27,019
panel and toggle until the word heater appears. Press and hold up to turn the heater on and to

233
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:33,160
raise the temperature. The heater will only activate and operate while the switch is pressed.

234
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,279
It will take a few moments to get going and then may continue for a moment after the switch is

235
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:39,880
released. Practice your timing and above all take care not to overheat the habitat. Just after the

236
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:45,640
habitat is first created, temperature is zero. Unlike modern American heaters, the heating

237
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:50,680
units are measured in Celsius, the same scale used by Dr. Cassell. This is going to be bad.

238
00:31:50,680 --> 00:32:04,859
I can't change that. It's in Celsius. I don't know what that means. I just saw the image in

239
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:18,890
the preview. That was fucked up. Okay. To ensure the eggs hatch properly... Are you listening to me?

240
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:32,940
Are you listening? To ensure... I don't care. Whatever. I'll never get it right. To ensure the

241
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:40,180
eggs hatch properly, the temperature of the habitat should be maintained between 15 and 20 degrees

242
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:46,099
everywhere else in the world besides America. After the eggs have hatched, observe semen carefully

243
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:49,940
to determine the appropriate temperature setting and then maintain it accordingly.

244
00:32:49,940 --> 00:33:05,099
So 15 between 15 and 20 degrees. Okay. Oxygen supply. Imagine not doing this. I can't fucking...

245
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,779
I'm so glad I did this. Remember like...

246
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:25,509
Display the habitat operation panel until the word air appears. Press and hold up to supply a stream

247
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:32,039
of oxygen into the tank. The oxygen supply will only continue to increase for the duration you

248
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:36,779
hold it. Just after the habitat is first created, the level of oxygen is zero. When the oxygen level

249
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:42,859
is lower than 50, when it's lower than 50, semen isn't in danger of suffocation. The appropriate

250
00:33:42,859 --> 00:33:47,259
level depends on the number of living objects in the habitat. However, it is safe to assume

251
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:53,269
that this level must stay above 80 whenever possible. All right. Let me like just fucking

252
00:33:53,269 --> 00:34:05,930
do this first. So we've got... Here's the menu. Heater. 15 degrees, right? Okay. That's 0.05,

253
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:13,610
right? Oh, I see. It slowly does it. Okay. This guy's a bit 15 to 20. Camera's not big enough.

254
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:19,980
Oh, fuck. All right. I gotta turn on the generator. I gotta let it go, though. I gotta let it go,

255
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:31,980
because it takes a minute to stop, right? Put it to 100 to do a soft-boiled egg.

256
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:39,420
You are fucked up. That's not nice. Did you think about what you just said before you said it?

257
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:53,030
Wow. Is it gonna suffocate? How long does it take to suffocate? Probably would have already

258
00:34:53,030 --> 00:35:04,170
happened. Okay. Slow down. Slow down. Well, how do I like my... I like my eggs over medium.

259
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:12,840
Yeah, I know. Someone's gonna be like, really? Over easy? No. Over medium. I like a soft but

260
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:21,530
tangible yolk in the middle. Over easy is disgusting to me. It just is. I'm sorry. It is.

261
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:35,590
It's barely even cooked in the middle. All right. 15 to 20. Here we go. All right. So I'm

262
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:41,210
gonna keep it in like around like 17 to 18, you know? Like right here should be good.

263
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:54,179
Okay. Now we need to do air. What did it say for air? 80? I'm not fucking it up, am I?

264
00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:02,820
Do you don't drink raw eggs for strength? No. I don't drink raw eggs for strength.

265
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:09,340
Clean the water. I don't know how to do that yet. I need to read how to do that.

266
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:24,519
Let me at least let him breathe. Are you guys sour, please, into this? Holy shit. We can actually

267
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:43,659
see the tank now. It said keep it above 80. Who knew that reading would help, right? I know.

268
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:54,340
Can you have too much air? What happens if you have over air? Oh, that's as high as it can go.

269
00:36:54,340 --> 00:37:02,019
All right. Cleaning. How do I clean? Let's get this to higher. What happens if there's too much?

270
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:09,460
No. Oxygen. If there's too much oxygen, it's bad for you, right? Isn't that how that works?

271
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:16,260
Would you like to save and end the session? We breathe CO2, right? So if like the O2 wasn't

272
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:22,230
there or if it was too much, it would be like helium. It would turn into H2O, which would be

273
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:39,659
helium. Now we exhale CO2. Sorry. My mistake, scientists in chat. Okay. Cleaning. You will

274
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:43,820
discover that with each passing day, the water in Seaman's Aquarium will become cloudier,

275
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:48,619
indicating a worsening in sanitation condition of the habitat. Cleaning the water is simple,

276
00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:52,860
and all that you must do is increase the oxygen supply. That's it. As you do this,

277
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:59,300
you will notice the water become clearer. Keep the water clean. So you just have to put air in it.

278
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:09,590
Just make it oxygenate the water to clean it. H2O is water. It's hydrogen and then oxygen.

279
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:16,139
That's not water. Hydrogen is its own thing. Oxygen, when you combine them together,

280
00:38:16,139 --> 00:38:21,579
you get hydrogen and oxygen. Water is water. It just exists. You're talking about like a chemical

281
00:38:21,579 --> 00:38:27,539
made in a fucking lab. All right. Please don't leave if you think I'm like actually that stupid.

282
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:31,739
Some of you guys might just be like, all right, this guy's fucking out of his mind. I'm out of

283
00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:38,309
here. All right. So I need to know how, what was the thing about the Nautilus again? The Nautilus

284
00:38:38,309 --> 00:38:45,900
down there. All right. Feeding your Seaman. Press L to switch to the storage matrix. You'll notice

285
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,300
11 food pellets that are used to feed Seaman once it reaches the Gilman stage of development.

286
00:38:51,019 --> 00:39:03,050
We're not there yet. How to say goodbye to Seaman. Living in harmony with Seaman.

287
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:11,300
Ah, exchanging food with another razor. Advice. Final notes and pointers.

288
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:19,000
Okay, hold on. How do I make the egg hatch? Do I have to feed the egg? Do I have to like inject a

289
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:33,639
syringe into the egg? What was the thing about the Nautilus like eating mushrooms? So this is,

290
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:43,690
okay, we're in day one. So day two. So, okay, let's just take a look. So that's grab. So this

291
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:50,090
is to move forward. Okay. This is the zoom. Yeah. But you know what I mean? Like what can I,

292
00:39:50,969 --> 00:39:55,780
that's just the egg right there. All right. It's multiplying. It's turning into four cells.

293
00:39:56,579 --> 00:40:13,139
Is this going to eat it? He's going to eat this. Okay. So now it has to be tomorrow.

294
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:22,059
When am I going to eat it? No, I can't talk yet. I don't have the ability to speak. It's called

295
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:36,969
mitosis, stupid. Doesn't it take actual days for the game to progress? Yeah. So how do I save it?

296
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:44,900
Okay. How do I get, how do I change this clock in the Dreamcast? It only takes a few minutes.

297
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:52,949
I'm going to have to go, I'm going to have to turn the console off like 30 times this stream.

298
00:40:53,670 --> 00:41:08,139
I have to go change the date and time until tomorrow. All right. We'll just get away to

299
00:41:08,139 --> 00:41:18,280
the egg to hatch. Save and quit. Would you like to save and end the session? Okay. You just have to

300
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,199
wait. But hold on. Do I have to wait? I think I have to wait till tomorrow is when the egg hatches.

301
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:30,539
So I can't just leave. What do you mean no cheating? I'm going to cheat the whole day.

302
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:37,139
It only takes a few minutes. It hatches. Okay. All right. All right. Hold on. Hold on. Let me

303
00:41:37,139 --> 00:41:49,349
get to the part of the instructional booklet. If the mushrooms do not evolve within a few days

304
00:41:49,349 --> 00:42:02,940
of their hatching, they will die. Whoa. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What, what,

305
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:12,920
what do I do about the balloons? What, how do I do this? We got it. We got life. How do I,

306
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:24,440
when do they turn into, uh, sea monkeys? What do you mean it died? It didn't die. It's all right.

307
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:37,219
Now do I have them get eaten? It's not dead. These are like the eggs. One of these. Some of

308
00:42:37,219 --> 00:42:43,079
these are going to survive. Make sure hot water heater. These are the mushrooms. Okay.

309
00:42:44,650 --> 00:43:01,079
Tap the nautilus. There's too much air in here. I don't need too much air. It said keep it above 80.

310
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:43,849
Uh oh. Hello. Oh shit. Look at this. Get him. Should I be doing this? He's going to get one.

311
00:43:43,849 --> 00:44:03,739
He's going to get one. Is this how do you make a sea man? Now saving. Now saving. Now saving.

312
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:19,780
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. He's pissed. What did I do? Whoa. He got one. He actually just got one.

313
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:56,380
This is making me uncomfortable. Just open a guide. I think we're good. They aren't dying.

314
00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:01,579
Don't worry. No, I know. They're going to get like spit out. What's going on up here? How's the air?

315
00:45:01,579 --> 00:45:09,929
How's the heat? It's okay. Air is okay. Takes a few minutes. We can just chill. It's all good.

316
00:45:10,489 --> 00:45:15,699
How many does he need to eat? If the mushrooms do not evolve within a few days they're hatching,

317
00:45:15,699 --> 00:45:20,179
they will die. Position the hand over the nautilus. The mushrooms will float towards the nautilus to

318
00:45:20,179 --> 00:45:23,219
be eaten. Do not be alarmed by this behavior and continue as normal. Once the nautilus has

319
00:45:23,219 --> 00:45:29,960
consumed four mushroomers, it will begin to undergo our transformation. He's got to eat two more.

320
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:57,980
Eat two more of these. Come on, grab one. Come on. What's his problem? Eat it. He already ate three.

321
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:09,130
I think he needs to eat four. Does he have a brain? We need more air. We got plenty of air.

322
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:21,179
The heat and the air are fine. Come on, grab one. Grab one. Come on. You need one more. Come on.

323
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:43,929
He needs to get one more. Come on. Down here. Come on. No. No. Just go get eaten. Did he eat four?

324
00:46:43,929 --> 00:46:56,519
I thought he only ate three. Don't annoy him. Just let him be. That was weird. All right. So

325
00:46:56,519 --> 00:47:04,460
there are only four left in the tank. So that means maybe he did already eat four. All right.

326
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:11,449
So then he's going to shit out a seed. So should I go on the clock now and make it like two days

327
00:47:11,449 --> 00:47:29,510
later? He only eats them when the air is lower. I'm not going to believe that bullshit. There's

328
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:43,880
too much air. I can't even lower it. So even if that one guy was telling the truth. Are you sure

329
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:49,099
you want to continue with this? It's a very disturbing experience. This was a hundred bucks.

330
00:47:49,099 --> 00:48:06,090
So yes, this was eighty dollars. Eighty. What's going on? I think is he doing something here?

331
00:48:17,349 --> 00:48:23,750
Just use an emulator. An emulator cannot do the microphone. This is the only way.

332
00:48:23,750 --> 00:49:00,300
Whoa! What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? Why is he like dying? Uh save him. I don't know.

333
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:13,500
How do I? Is that I can't save him? And I want the real experience. I don't want the emulator

334
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:18,969
experience. I want the real microphone. The real controller. I want to be authentic. So when my

335
00:49:18,969 --> 00:49:25,510
children come into the world they can use they can do it too. Check the oxygen. Here we're good.

336
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:42,019
This is actually pretty disturbing. I don't think I want to tap. He's going through some shit right

337
00:49:42,019 --> 00:50:04,119
now. This is okay. Do I have to do anything? It looks like he's cooking in a fryer. Like he's in

338
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:11,400
a pan. Yeah that's fucked up. Yeah yellow is bad. Red is dangerous. Yeah as long as it's blue it's

339
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:16,170
good. It was between 15 and 20 for here and above 80 for this. So we're good.

340
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:36,179
Turn off the lights. Is that the problem? I feel like there's something I should be doing here.

341
00:50:36,179 --> 00:50:44,889
Turn the oxygen off. I can't. You can only turn it up. Why would anyone buy this game? Because

342
00:50:44,889 --> 00:51:07,659
it was one of the first video games to allow. Would you like to save and end the session?

343
00:51:17,179 --> 00:51:34,739
Uh communicating. Communicating once seaman has learned a reasonable vocabulary. Try to

344
00:51:34,739 --> 00:51:38,500
initiate a conversation in the beginning. It is generally acceptable to address seaman with

345
00:51:39,219 --> 00:51:45,699
hey or seaman. To do so a mature seaman will often respond to phrases such as say something

346
00:51:45,699 --> 00:51:51,590
or talk to me. If you observe seaman's manner closely you'll have no problems distinguishing

347
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:55,750
when seaman is ready to begin conversing. All conversations with seaman must be made

348
00:51:55,750 --> 00:52:01,590
via the microphone. Be sure to press a for the full duration of your utterance when speaking to

349
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:07,670
seaman. Once each utterance is complete be sure to release a. Note that the general progress of

350
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:12,869
your conversation with seaman is indicated by the icons that appear on the LCD screen of the VMU.

351
00:52:20,809 --> 00:52:39,340
Hello. How are you? What is your purpose? What is your purpose?

352
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:57,159
Where's the mothership? How do you like your tank? Are you comfortable?

353
00:53:06,219 --> 00:53:18,170
Hey how are you? They don't they don't how do I teach them? This one wants to talk. This is the

354
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:30,219
one that's closest. Look it keeps coming over here. No no I want this one. Back off. Good afternoon.

355
00:53:34,789 --> 00:53:53,349
Hi hi play door play dough chicken strips crayons crayon

356
00:53:53,829 --> 00:54:02,250
hoi mac and cheese. What are what are the lives of kids like? School.

357
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:29,269
Fortnite. I'm gonna teach him the alphabet. A. B. C. D.

358
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:46,010
He's gonna see the avengers progressing here. We'll see end game theater. E. Seaman.

359
00:54:46,650 --> 00:55:10,300
Waha. U. Seaman. U. Seaman. U. Molo. U. Seaman. Squeena. Squee. Seaman. Seaman. Play door. Seaman.

360
00:55:16,309 --> 00:55:23,619
How do I feed how do I feed them? Would you like to save and end the session?

361
00:55:24,659 --> 00:55:34,900
Feeding. Once you'll notice 11 food pellets that are to be used to feed seem once it reaches the

362
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:55,289
Gillman stage of development. Are they they're not are they at Gillman? Not yet right? No no no yes

363
00:55:55,289 --> 00:56:02,090
yes they are at Gillman. No yes. It's speaking Simlish. Yes they are. Yes yes. Oh you guys saying

364
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:07,829
no you don't know what the hell are you talking about? Okay to feed once it reaches give it to

365
00:56:07,829 --> 00:56:12,230
feed. Seaman use the analog thumb pad to select food pellet and then press and hold grab it.

366
00:56:13,349 --> 00:56:17,909
Press L to toggle to the aquarium tank then release X and R to drop the food into the water.

367
00:56:18,969 --> 00:56:23,449
Okay the food pellets initially available in the storage matrix will enable you to feed Seaman for

368
00:56:23,449 --> 00:56:29,690
a short time provided you do not overfeed it. However after that you will need to create an

369
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:37,590
alternate method of providing Seaman with food. What? There is no need to panic for Seaman may

370
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:42,070
be able to help you to determine a new method for providing food when the time is right.

371
00:56:42,789 --> 00:56:46,809
So be sure to observe carefully and listen well to what Seaman has to tell you.

372
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:58,619
What is it gonna like eat its own shit? I don't understand that. Take the utmost care to prevent

373
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:05,340
using up all the food in the storage. You are advised to only feed Seaman when it is hungry.

374
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:09,980
Prick up your ears listen carefully to what Seaman says and be sure to carry out its

375
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:35,780
instructions in a timely fashion. So hungry? Hungry? Are you hungry? Hungry? Yeah yeah said yeah.

376
00:57:37,670 --> 00:58:02,570
Hungry? Cool okay. Who gets to eat it? Oh they do they all they all share the cookie. He just

377
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:25,079
stole it. He just took it. Hello? I told you not to feed them. Well I wouldn't mean that not to feed

378
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:31,690
them. They're not speaking English. How do I know what hungry means? All they're going they're doing

379
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:37,929
like reverse speech like death line. Like that I'm hungry. How am I supposed to know what that means?

380
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:48,920
Now I was right to feed them. Are you ready to evolve Pikachu?

381
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:57,539
Is it chilly in the tank? Yeah I think it's chilly in the tank. Hold on let me see.

382
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:07,880
All right yeah it's a little chilly. 17 about we'll make it 18.

383
00:59:08,599 --> 00:59:16,280
All right let's get the stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff not too hot too hot. All right we're

384
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:21,099
good. What's going on over here? These are like the mushrooms. Are these things just gonna die?

385
00:59:27,099 --> 00:59:41,400
Didn't why are there only three before that are alive? Yes. Yes.

386
00:59:44,659 --> 00:59:56,820
Yes. How do you teach a kid language? I don't know how this works. I don't have any children.

387
00:59:56,820 --> 01:00:08,619
How does a kid learn? I have no idea. I have no idea what to do. See if any died. I don't think so.

388
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:27,159
No I think maybe maybe two died. What's what's a sim uh greeting? Like like uh

389
01:00:28,039 --> 01:00:32,340
how do I do this? How do I speak? How what's with it? It's like it's like bravolo mule

390
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:45,099
bye right? Sul sul. Clap clap clap. Ratanar fly.

391
01:00:45,820 --> 01:01:10,679
Waha. Lumpa. Lumpa. Wrap. Laffy. Laffy. Laffy. Fortnight. Forca. Pabra. Pabra. Pabra.

392
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:27,000
Yeah. Hooray. Hooray. Fibula. Fibula. Isn't that an organ? Fibula is like here right? Where's the

393
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:51,050
fibula? Check the other ones. Hold on. Hello. Hello. See it's reversed. Are you comfortable?

394
01:01:52,599 --> 01:01:59,639
Comfy? I have one. Are there translations in the handbook? I don't think so. It just tells

395
01:01:59,639 --> 01:02:07,670
you when they understand what you're saying. Advice. Here we go. Please realize that concepts

396
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:12,309
such as goals or scores do not apply to this game. You are free to enjoy semen in whatever manner you

397
01:02:12,309 --> 01:02:17,750
find appropriate. However if you endeavor to successfully raise and assist in semen's evolution

398
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:25,800
there are a few points you must take into consideration. Go to sleep. Sleep.

399
01:02:27,559 --> 01:02:34,010
Okay. First off is a strong relationship between knowledge acquisition and semen's growth process.

400
01:02:35,289 --> 01:02:42,679
Just following around. I've got plenty of air right? Just watch this one for a while.

401
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:48,099
As semen's caretaker you are encouraged to take the initiative and talk to semen daily to stimulate

402
01:02:48,099 --> 01:02:56,659
its desire to learn and in turn aid its maturation. Note that without conversation

403
01:02:56,659 --> 01:03:01,139
semen's growth process will stop. Therefore it's important to speak to semen throughout its growth

404
01:03:01,139 --> 01:03:04,900
and development even well before it's matured to the stage of being able to converse with you.

405
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:11,139
Secondly it's imperative at some point that you transform the habitat aquarium into a terrarium

406
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:21,030
for semen as this is crucial to aiding in its evolution. But not to worry semen will assist

407
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:26,500
you in achieving this goal when the time is right. Be sure to listen carefully and attentively to

408
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:30,260
all that semen tells you. Eventually when an appropriate level of maturity has been reached

409
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:35,639
you must help semen become free of the confines of the habitat. How do I transform the habitat

410
01:03:35,639 --> 01:03:40,199
aquarium into a land-filled terrarium? What environment lies outside the habitat? How do

411
01:03:40,199 --> 01:03:49,210
I enable semen to gain freedom from its confines? These are all questions you must be longing to

412
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:57,579
have answered. However we have opted not to provide these answers in this manual. We feel

413
01:03:57,579 --> 01:04:01,420
it would be far more rewarding experience if you do experiment using the exact same laboratory

414
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:06,619
conditions as Jean-Paul Gusset in the 30s. We have the utmost confidence that you will be successful

415
01:04:06,619 --> 01:04:23,239
in your semen rearing efforts. So I just keep stimulating their brains and then I'm going to

416
01:04:23,239 --> 01:04:40,840
turn the clock forward. Hello? Hello? Hello? Okay. Who got attention? Hey, how are you?

417
01:04:43,159 --> 01:04:50,440
Have you heard any good jokes lately? Oink-a. Oink-a? Oink-a. Oink-a.

418
01:04:51,159 --> 01:05:04,969
Momma. Read the B-movie script to them. I'm not, I'm not gonna fucking do that. Yeah, what?

419
01:05:05,849 --> 01:05:15,769
I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna read these children the late six and a half year old meme. At least

420
01:05:15,769 --> 01:05:28,170
give us something that's more relevant to today. Okay. Sure. I'm gonna fast forward time now.

421
01:05:29,849 --> 01:05:33,690
Yeah. I will fast forward time now and then I'm gonna come back and see how you're doing.

422
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:47,940
Gnome it. How am I gonna do that? I don't have speakers. Sing him a song.

423
01:05:48,739 --> 01:06:00,659
O Canada, our home and sacred land.

424
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:19,960
True patriot side and all thy sons command. With spoken word we see thy shine. The true

425
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:32,119
north young and wise. We're, that's all I know. Any words for that? I'm not, I don't, I'm not

426
01:06:32,119 --> 01:06:42,019
Canadian. Why would I know the Canadian theme song? You know, I'm supposed to know every country's

427
01:06:42,019 --> 01:06:51,260
theme song? I live in the United States of America. I've been to Canada twice. I'm supposed to know

428
01:06:51,260 --> 01:07:05,269
the words to their fucking song? Are you serious? Twice is enough. Wow. Can you believe what they

429
01:07:05,269 --> 01:07:15,349
just said? Cool. Cool. All right. Um, should I fast forward now? One day. I'm gonna save it. I'm

430
01:07:15,349 --> 01:07:23,079
gonna end and I'm gonna fast forward the clock a day and we'll see how they're doing. Okay. Be good.

431
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:32,739
See you soon. Goodbye. Goodbye. I'm not gonna fast forward 40 years. They'll be dead. I'm gonna

432
01:07:32,739 --> 01:07:40,579
go one day. Come back one day until they get to be adults and I can talk. The tank is not gonna be on

433
01:07:40,579 --> 01:07:55,179
fire. Let's put the heat up to like 19 and then I have to, oh, not too hot, not too hot, not too

434
01:07:55,179 --> 01:08:04,710
hot. Stop before 20 please. Put the oxygen, get it to like 100. Okay. Dim the light a little bit.

435
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:12,739
All right. Now they're good. I should be able to. Would you like to save and end the session?

436
01:08:12,739 --> 01:08:19,800
Save and end the session. Go into the clock. Make it tomorrow. I'm not cooking the fishes, guys.

437
01:08:22,739 --> 01:08:25,140
Just, you just wait till I get to fucking have a conversation with all these

438
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:35,079
butt heads. The cliff, there's a cliffhanger in the game. The sequel is only in Japanese.

439
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:47,739
It's not gonna work. Why not? All right. Here we go. Saving. We're locked in now. I'm gonna

440
01:08:47,739 --> 01:08:53,670
change the date to tomorrow. Oh, by the way, I wanted to show you this because I, you may now

441
01:08:53,670 --> 01:08:59,510
turn the power off. Okay. But before we go any further, you guys need to see this. So I also

442
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:05,430
made sure they got Space Channel 5, the original Space Channel 5. And I don't, that's like a plan

443
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:14,220
to play this. I don't want to open this because look, this is like original shrink wrapped

444
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:23,500
packaging. Isn't this like an artifact? I don't want to open this. You know what I mean? I don't

445
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:31,380
think I want to break the seal. This might be worth like 50 grand in like a thousand years.

446
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:38,890
You know, my great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great grandchildren

447
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:45,689
might be able to sell this for like fucking a million dollars. Here's the crazy thing. Okay.

448
01:09:45,689 --> 01:09:49,850
Imagine like this clip is going to be saved for probably a while. I don't know if it's going to

449
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:54,409
take a thousand years, but let's just say that like Twitch, somebody saves this clip on a hard

450
01:09:54,409 --> 01:09:57,529
drive and it gets thrown in the dump somewhere. Like a hundred years from now, somebody comes

451
01:09:57,529 --> 01:10:02,729
across it and they see this clip of me fucking ripping this and they have a heart attack because

452
01:10:02,729 --> 01:10:07,130
it's worth like $10 million now. We're talking like a thousand years in the future. This is going

453
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:11,369
to be one of those like viral videos that people are like, Oh my God, I'm cringing watching him

454
01:10:11,369 --> 01:10:18,489
open space channel five. It's going to be worth a million. All right. Let me, uh, let me just do

455
01:10:18,489 --> 01:10:37,579
this safe to turn the power off, right? Let's fast forward to tomorrow. Okay. Here we go. We're good.

456
01:10:43,779 --> 01:10:59,529
So now we go to settings to three 10, 2019 date and time. Okay. So now, uh, three, uh, three 11,

457
01:11:02,069 --> 01:11:18,180
right? That's tomorrow, right? Okay. Let's go. Let's see how they're doing tomorrow.

458
01:11:27,029 --> 01:11:36,149
That's not month. That's day. Holy shit. Someone just gave a hundred bucks. Why is that not on

459
01:11:36,149 --> 01:11:45,220
screen? Uh, flying muffin man just gave a hundred bucks. Thank you for the a hundred fucking

460
01:11:45,220 --> 01:11:49,720
goddamn dollars. And they say, Hey man, you're the best. I don't have the attention span to watch

461
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:57,239
streams too often, but it will always be a treat to see a new video up. Much love. Hello. Thank you.

462
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:04,739
So welcome to the laboratory of Jean Paul Gosset. That means a lot. Thank you, man. Greetings and

463
01:12:04,739 --> 01:12:14,949
welcome back. You're doing a good job. First, a recap of your previous visit of recap episode

464
01:12:14,949 --> 01:12:20,470
two, the Nautilus has become prey to the parasitic mushroomers and thus the Gilman were born.

465
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:27,510
Gil stands for the gills of a fish. So a Gilman is a being who breathes underwater.

466
01:12:30,939 --> 01:12:36,380
Gilman has learned human words. Try speaking to him if you haven't already.

467
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:46,279
I did that. I did that. At the moment, the habitat contains four Gilman.

468
01:12:47,079 --> 01:12:53,590
Four Gilman. They are suffering from the cold. Please use the heater to raise the temperature

469
01:12:53,590 --> 01:13:00,489
to a more comfortable level. They are suffering. So let us get over to the tank. All right. Well,

470
01:13:00,489 --> 01:13:05,369
flying muffin man, thank you for the insanely generous amount of money. Thank you. 10,000 bits.

471
01:13:06,329 --> 01:13:12,500
A heater goes down over time. All right, let's go. How are they doing? Hey, kids, dad's home.

472
01:13:16,010 --> 01:13:25,180
They know words now. You shouldn't have gone ahead 24 hours. How am I supposed to fucking not?

473
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:31,210
You're not. No, we're going to do. We're all right. Let's see. Oh,

474
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:33,210
oh,

475
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:48,439
okay. I swear to fucking God, this keeps getting stuck on the bottom of my glass,

476
01:13:49,479 --> 01:13:58,729
but I need it because of the coaster. Slow down. Don't burn them. It just keeps. It's like a

477
01:13:58,729 --> 01:14:04,630
suction cup when I lift it up and then it falls. Good thing. Good thing. I got this beautiful new

478
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:09,989
keyboard. Oh, you guys, I want to make sure you guys see this new keyboard, by the way, pause the

479
01:14:09,989 --> 01:14:16,149
game. You guys need, would you like to save and end the session? Uh, you know, people have had some

480
01:14:16,149 --> 01:14:21,029
recommended keyboards. Hey, you should check out like the Logitech, like G 1000 or something,

481
01:14:21,029 --> 01:14:24,229
right? I'm like, yeah, that one looks kind of good. Razor's got some like fucking awesome

482
01:14:24,229 --> 01:14:31,289
keyboards. I mean, that's all right. Stick with my own fucking bread and butter right here.

483
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:48,439
This is an Amazon basics keyboard came in the mail today. I believe this keyboard was seven

484
01:14:48,439 --> 01:14:54,340
and a half dollars. I could be wrong. Basic streamer. You don't need all the bells and whistles.

485
01:14:55,140 --> 01:15:01,460
It's just a block. Guys, I'm going to tell you the biggest scam in all of human history.

486
01:15:03,479 --> 01:15:10,119
This is just a plastic brick with letter buttons on it. Some people sell you this shit for like

487
01:15:10,119 --> 01:15:20,859
fucking 300, 400 bucks. This, it's a, it's letter buttons. Don't let anybody fool you.

488
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:30,619
Like $400 keyboard and Amazon basics $8 keyboard are the same keyboard. One just clicks has like,

489
01:15:30,619 --> 01:15:42,779
you know, Oh, I got the O-rings on mine. We both have the same function. You know, don't,

490
01:15:42,779 --> 01:15:53,300
don't fall for the bullshit. Same thing with the gamer chairs. Look at this thing. This is fine.

491
01:15:56,119 --> 01:16:00,840
You don't need those, like the big thing that comes up and guess what? Hey, I got one of those

492
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:06,359
gamer chairs. All right. Yeah, it's nice. By the way, the rest of my stream forever

493
01:16:06,359 --> 01:16:13,140
has a billboard advertisement of the company that is fucking that I bought this chair from,

494
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:19,140
that I got this chair from. You're a constant advertisement forever. If I got one of those

495
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:27,239
chairs, I would just fucking duct tape gun across the whole thing. And they come up so high. I feel

496
01:16:27,239 --> 01:16:33,100
like I'm sitting in one of those like the egg from the men in black test. Everyone, Will Smith

497
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:37,020
is doing like the test and he's in like the fucking egg. I don't want to sit in one of those

498
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:44,359
fucking things. No, you can go, you can go to Staples and get this chair for like fucking 80

499
01:16:44,359 --> 01:16:54,119
bucks, 75 bucks, 40 bucks. You don't need a personalized billboard for a company that you

500
01:16:54,119 --> 01:17:00,810
fucking probably talk to twice in emails. You know, I got such a good relationship with this

501
01:17:00,810 --> 01:17:17,210
chair company, you know, I exchanged two emails and they sent one to me. Fucking come on. That

502
01:17:17,289 --> 01:17:24,920
chair is $150. I have one. How many emails did you exchange? All right, what do I have to do?

503
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:42,979
Oh yeah, the heater. They know English words now. That bit sucked. That wasn't a bit. That was me

504
01:17:42,979 --> 01:17:52,489
speaking in reality. You can tell it's a bit because I'll do the bit voice. You know, this,

505
01:17:52,489 --> 01:17:56,489
this is the bit voice. Let me tell you something really funny. That's a bit voice. I was just

506
01:17:56,489 --> 01:18:07,609
speaking as Jeremy Albertson there as a concerned streamer. All right, let's go see what they've

507
01:18:07,609 --> 01:18:17,140
learned in a day. So a good light heater. Let's make it a little hot. You're doing a bit while

508
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:25,770
your kids die. Are they hungry? Well, let's check, check on that. They look a little fatter. Hello?

509
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:43,060
I thought you knew English words. You heard it. That was such a shitty burp too. That was just a

510
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:51,210
fifth grader burp. That was like I chugged a juice box and tried to do a big burp at the lunch table.

511
01:18:55,960 --> 01:19:08,619
How are you today? How are you? Seamen. Seamen.

512
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:33,079
What? English. More time. You just said more time? English. English. What's the point?

513
01:19:41,289 --> 01:19:54,789
Already like a nihilistic fish. Crap. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to say to this.

514
01:19:55,510 --> 01:20:22,680
The point is food. Hungry? Hungry? No. How do I? Can I like grab it? I'm sorry.

515
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:36,699
English. English. What for? To learn. Spanish. Japanese.

516
01:20:39,159 --> 01:20:51,560
Japanese. Molo. English. More time. Hurry up. Yeah. All right. Should I feed them? Hungry?

517
01:20:54,699 --> 01:21:01,960
Check on one of your brothers and sisters. Where are they? Let's try you.

518
01:21:03,369 --> 01:21:10,180
Where'd you just go? Hello? He heard it but he just didn't respond. Hello?

519
01:21:13,050 --> 01:21:39,180
Pabra? English. English. I'm learning. Very good. Very good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. No.

520
01:21:41,000 --> 01:22:02,470
Cool. Learning. Learning. Learning. More. More. More. Good. Good. Good. Very good. Very good. Good.

521
01:22:04,619 --> 01:22:13,300
Sick dude. English. Teach him fuck. What am I? Like the 13 year old older brother

522
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:31,460
that has, you know. No. Hungry? Food? No. All right. What's he doing? Food?

523
01:22:33,539 --> 01:22:42,300
Should I feed them? It's been a day, right? I think I have to feed them. How many? Are they

524
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:52,600
like a camel? Do they eat once a day? Once a week? How much does a sea man eat? Just one pellet a day.

525
01:22:52,600 --> 01:23:00,739
That sounds good. I got 11 of these. So I got 11, 10 more days worth of food. All right. Let's

526
01:23:00,739 --> 01:23:07,109
put it down. Go eat. Come on. Come on. Come on. Don't let them have the whole thing.

527
01:23:09,619 --> 01:23:17,770
There's four of you. Come on. Get over here. You're gonna be, you're dead. I love how their feeding

528
01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:30,489
is just me dropping one cookie crisp into the tank. Ate it. Ate it. Ate it. Food? Good. It was good,

529
01:23:30,489 --> 01:24:04,680
huh? People. Eat. Eat. Wake up. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Good. Good. Yes. Yes. Yes. No. No. Hoy. No.

530
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:15,779
No. No. There we go. We got yes, good, no. We need to, I need to teach them food.

531
01:24:16,659 --> 01:24:28,550
Food. Arranger. Food. That's how you do it to a kid. You go, food. And then they get it. Food.

532
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:38,579
I'm not going to scream in a microphone. Good. Okay, fine.

533
01:24:38,899 --> 01:25:03,460
Are you guys all set? Okay, guys. Have a good day. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. Bye.

534
01:25:07,430 --> 01:25:27,510
Bye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Bye. Okay. Let's see who we got. They've been fed. We've

535
01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:33,420
conversed a little. Let's make sure we got a good heaters at eight. Let's put the, put it up to like

536
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:38,460
just, I'm going to get this close to 20 as I can. Tell them you love them. They don't understand

537
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:43,399
that yet. Teach them their names. They don't know what they, how am I going to do that?

538
01:25:43,399 --> 01:26:04,710
They know how to say yes, no, and cool. I got to get this a little higher. 19, I'll get it to 19.5

539
01:26:04,710 --> 01:26:16,939
and then stop. Teach them the value of Bitcoin. Do research. Do research on market trends before

540
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:40,779
investing. Do not FOMO into new things. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Don't do

541
01:26:40,779 --> 01:26:48,949
what Jerma did. I'm implying that I lost a shitload of money. Motherfuck, I gained money.

542
01:26:49,510 --> 01:27:02,300
I think I just scared him. I scared him out of the tank. I have to get this higher.

543
01:27:02,939 --> 01:27:23,619
Seaman. Seaman. Seaman. You. Seaman. Seaman. Seaman. You. Seaman. Seaman. Seaman. You. Greg.

544
01:27:24,659 --> 01:27:38,819
Bamboo. Seaman. Seaman. Greg. Seaman. Greg. Yeah, we. Well, they know Seaman.

545
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:48,380
All right, heater's good. Let's get the air of 200. Okay. Would you like to save and end the session?

546
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:56,359
Shouldn't be teaching children how to say Greg. What's wrong with Greg?

547
01:27:59,619 --> 01:28:30,550
Okay, here we go. All right, it's the next day. So maybe I shouldn't be, maybe it should be tomorrow,

548
01:28:30,550 --> 01:28:43,560
but not completely 24 hours. How's that? That looks good. Looks fine. All right, let's go.

549
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:53,300
It's, we're now two days from now. Teach them hatred for other sentient beings.

550
01:28:54,100 --> 01:29:12,489
Why the hell would I do that? I'll go with like hungry first. Let you know, like, that's how

551
01:29:12,489 --> 01:29:19,779
my niece, whenever it would be hungry, it'd be like, do you, you, this, this? And she'd go,

552
01:29:20,659 --> 01:29:28,500
and you go, oh, okay, yeah, she's hungry. Just grow hands. Here we go. Welcome to the laboratory.

553
01:29:32,890 --> 01:29:41,029
Greetings and welcome back. You're doing a good job. At the moment, the habitat contains

554
01:29:42,220 --> 01:29:51,159
four Gilmen. They are suffering from the cold. Please use the heater to raise the temperature

555
01:29:51,159 --> 01:29:59,420
to a more comfortable level. So let us head over to the tank. Okay. Feed, converse, English,

556
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:10,420
all things that need to be considered. Is that a metal straw? It sure is. It's a metal straw.

557
01:30:10,979 --> 01:30:17,750
I like it because the straw, if you have a cold beverage, the straw gets cold and it makes it,

558
01:30:17,829 --> 01:30:22,470
when liquid goes up to the tube, it's, uh, it's colder and it felt like that. I like the way it

559
01:30:22,470 --> 01:30:30,380
sounds. I like the way it feels in the mouth. I prefer a metal or copper straw. All right. How

560
01:30:30,380 --> 01:30:50,789
are we doing? Hi. Hi. Hi. Fuck you. I'll just talk to your brother. Hi. English. English.

561
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:53,340
Talk more of that.

562
01:30:58,170 --> 01:31:01,050
Oh, they're cold. They're cold. They're cold. Right. Right. Right. Right. I'm just going in there

563
01:31:01,050 --> 01:31:10,470
going English. Speak English. It's cold. English. Yeah.

564
01:31:17,739 --> 01:31:23,500
Dirty tank too. All right. All right. Relax. Don't like go more than 17 for now.

565
01:31:26,220 --> 01:31:28,220
Yeah. Which one's the more talkative?

566
01:31:35,859 --> 01:31:40,439
Talk a little bit, feed them. How do I do interactions?

567
01:31:41,079 --> 01:32:01,399
Talk to all of them equally. I can't do that. That's too hard. Good morning. Yeah. Good morning.

568
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:13,369
Hi. Hi. How are you? Are you having a good day?

569
01:32:13,850 --> 01:32:22,489
What's the point? So I can understand you.

570
01:32:24,619 --> 01:32:33,909
So I can understand you. For me to understand you. Let's talk.

571
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:49,699
What's your favorite food? My favorite food is pizza. Hi. Pizza.

572
01:32:50,500 --> 01:33:11,579
Pizza. My favorite food is pizza. What's your favorite food? Mine's pizza. Hi. Hey. Hello.

573
01:33:13,609 --> 01:33:24,279
English. This is that was German. How would you how would you learn German? I haven't said any

574
01:33:24,279 --> 01:33:34,310
German words. No. Yeah. It's Russian. Not German. Nine is German. Russian. Why is he speaking

575
01:33:34,310 --> 01:33:56,060
Russian? Russian. Russian. English. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning.

576
01:33:56,779 --> 01:34:07,109
Halleray. Pee blood. What are you talking about? It's been nice talking to you. Are you hungry?

577
01:34:08,229 --> 01:34:17,050
Night night. Night night. Good morning. Play, play, play. You want to play? All right. How do

578
01:34:17,050 --> 01:34:26,939
you? Would you like to save and end the session? How do I do that? He wants to play. Advice.

579
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:35,560
Exchanging food with another razor. Living in harmony. Okay. If a seaman is in a bad mood,

580
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:40,439
it will elect to discontinue conversation with you. Whether the cause of this mood swing is

581
01:34:40,439 --> 01:34:45,399
inadvertent or intentional on your part is of no relevance. The following situations have been

582
01:34:45,399 --> 01:34:51,720
noted to cause a deterioration of seaman mood. If you are violent towards or speak rudely to

583
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:57,399
seaman. If you're constantly using strange or foreign terms that seaman does not understand.

584
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:04,439
If you willfully and consistently repeat the same types of words over and over like pizza.

585
01:35:07,130 --> 01:35:11,449
If you fail to feed seaman over an extended period. If you fail to maintain a suitable living

586
01:35:11,449 --> 01:35:18,699
environment. If you willfully and continuously flick or grab and pick them up. Pay attention to

587
01:35:18,699 --> 01:35:25,000
seaman's health. Seaman is a living creature. In order for seaman to remain healthy, it is an

588
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:30,359
absolute must for you to provide food, oxygen, and a clean living environment. Pay careful attention

589
01:35:30,359 --> 01:35:35,239
to the state of the water and oxygen levels. Keep in mind that if you are away and unable to attend

590
01:35:35,239 --> 01:35:41,159
to seaman for a couple of days, seaman could possibly die. So if I'm away for more than a day

591
01:35:41,159 --> 01:35:54,180
too, they can die. So how do I interact? This feeding, this carrying, how to interact? Okay,

592
01:35:54,180 --> 01:36:00,100
tapping the glass with R, flick. While locked on in a close-up, position the hand icon over seaman

593
01:36:00,100 --> 01:36:05,220
and press and hold R for a few seconds till the icon changes as illustrated, then release it to

594
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:09,619
flick. However, note that if you do this too often, seaman may begin to dislike you.

595
01:36:10,979 --> 01:36:16,579
There's also tickle. Use the zoom function to zero on the seaman and position the hand over it,

596
01:36:16,579 --> 01:36:29,210
then press X repeatedly. This will put seaman in a good mood. Okay, note, do not attempt to tap,

597
01:36:29,210 --> 01:36:36,939
flick, or tickle other household pets, wild animals outside of the seaman kit. Seaman is a

598
01:36:36,939 --> 01:36:41,899
very special creature that will respond to such stimuli. However, other animals not in the seaman

599
01:36:41,899 --> 01:36:46,939
kit have been known to become far more aggressive when administered such contact and it is not

600
01:36:46,939 --> 01:37:10,739
advised. Yeah, don't do that to like any birds. All right, so here we go. So, I'm sorry. Okay,

601
01:37:10,739 --> 01:37:20,789
what about the other one? All right, that's how you just tap that. That's like, okay.

602
01:37:24,409 --> 01:37:43,340
So, I have to make them all happy. Hello. English. English. So, we're just gonna like pet them all.

603
01:37:44,539 --> 01:37:48,859
Only focus on one seaman. Well, everyone, people are just pissed off because I was only focusing

604
01:37:48,859 --> 01:37:59,449
on one of the children. Who's the smartest? Hello. Hello. I think we found the smart one.

605
01:38:01,579 --> 01:38:20,380
Food. How are you? How are you? Come here. Don't do this to a wild pig, you find.

606
01:38:24,439 --> 01:38:28,279
If you see a bear, don't run up to him and be like, hey bear, how are you? You're gonna get

607
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:41,100
fucking face ripped off. Why would you do that in the first place? Come here. Fun. Does it really

608
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:45,260
have to give a warning? Are people gonna sue this company if somebody tried to like pet a bear

609
01:38:45,260 --> 01:38:55,000
because they played a game about sea monkeys? Having fun? Are you having fun? Fun, fun, fun,

610
01:38:55,239 --> 01:39:21,159
fun. Let's play. Play. Having fun? Okay. Yeah. In 1776, Columbus signed the Declaration of

611
01:39:21,159 --> 01:39:30,869
Independence and then the British invaded and we repelled them and then we gained our independence.

612
01:39:31,909 --> 01:39:42,890
And then a couple of big wars were fought between lots of countries and then the computer came out

613
01:39:43,859 --> 01:39:53,670
and AOL was the first internet provider and then there was Netscape was a browser that eventually

614
01:39:53,670 --> 01:40:04,039
turned into Mozilla and after that there was faster internet and when the faster internet came out

615
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:11,819
everybody lost their minds and that's kind of where we are now.

616
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:20,489
You should be a history teacher. I'm condensing it all. I'm condensing it for the fish.

617
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:29,050
That's a lot. Trying to explain to a child like the concept of states that no it's not going to

618
01:40:29,050 --> 01:40:41,399
happen. There are 50 states in the United States. Hello. He's not paying attention anymore. Come here.

619
01:40:41,399 --> 01:41:01,479
Having fun? Having fun? Hello. Hello. How are you? Did I feed him today?

620
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:09,510
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Okay. No, I haven't.

621
01:41:15,159 --> 01:41:32,140
Come get it. Eat, eat, eat, eat. Good. Very good. We have to get a refill. English or no food. That's

622
01:41:32,140 --> 01:41:51,000
kind of fucked up. That one didn't even eat. English. English. What for? To learn.

623
01:41:53,640 --> 01:42:02,890
English. Learn English. Learn English. You first. Implying that I don't know English.

624
01:42:03,689 --> 01:42:18,390
What a dick. Are you in chat right now? Yeah, I won't. Get fucked, idiot. Easy.

625
01:42:20,329 --> 01:42:37,750
Easy. What's your favorite thing to do? Flibula. They always love, they love flibula. Fun. Dog.

626
01:42:37,829 --> 01:42:56,300
Who are you? Seaman. Oh, we're getting progress here. What's your name? Hey. I've said hey so

627
01:42:56,300 --> 01:43:12,890
many times. That's why. Hey. What is your name? Baby. No, baby. Baby. Baby. You are baby. You are

628
01:43:12,890 --> 01:43:30,250
baby. Baby. This is the moment we're keeping alive. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. What?

629
01:43:31,850 --> 01:43:44,949
See you tomorrow. Seaman. Seaman. Yes. Goodbye. Hi. Bye. Hi. Goodbye.

630
01:43:44,949 --> 01:44:01,210
Bye. See ya. Seaman. Seaman. They have no concept of time. Bye. All right. Let's go.

631
01:44:02,460 --> 01:44:15,479
Good night. Night. Good night. Good night. Night night. There we go. All right. Let's make sure

632
01:44:15,479 --> 01:44:25,659
everything's good. Now we're going to skip another day. Do you see what fucking is happening here?

633
01:44:25,659 --> 01:44:36,760
This is what I'm gonna have to deal with. Every time. Skip a week. No, they'll be dead. I'm not

634
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:47,289
doing that. They'll actually be dead. Let's get the 19.5. Nail the coaster to the desk.

635
01:44:49,529 --> 01:44:54,810
That would ruin the desk. Get an actual coaster. This is an actual coaster.

636
01:45:03,289 --> 01:45:09,819
What do you get an actual coaster? I bought these. They're coasters. Put salt on the glass.

637
01:45:09,819 --> 01:45:17,020
All right. Have a good air. It's the lights dimmed. Okay. Would you like to save and

638
01:45:17,020 --> 01:45:22,140
end the session? Tomorrow. Here we go. Now I have to piss. All right. You got pee break?

639
01:45:22,779 --> 01:45:28,119
Been two hours? Just about? Has it been two hours? Holy shit. What the fuck have we been doing?

640
01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:45,829
Jesus. I'm having a good time. Time flies. This shit, apparently. All right. Let me just

641
01:45:45,829 --> 01:48:50,470
piss it right back. Let me grab a refill. Okay. So I'm going to skip ahead. Is this bad for the

642
01:48:50,470 --> 01:48:53,829
Dreamcast? I'm not going to fuck up the Dreamcast, right? I think it's old as hell anyways.

643
01:48:55,029 --> 01:49:02,010
It's like turning it off, turning it on, turning it off, turning it to break it.

644
01:49:02,010 --> 01:49:14,119
I feel like it's going to cause a problem. All right. Settings 313. Like 8 a.m.

645
01:49:14,680 --> 01:49:23,050
That sounds pretty good. I'm going to fuck that up. Make sure everyone screams in my fucking mouth

646
01:49:24,100 --> 01:49:28,020
if I make that the wrong day. Because this has been a long time coming.

647
01:49:28,899 --> 01:49:32,979
And this is going to take, this is already taking about two hours. If I make that like

648
01:49:33,859 --> 01:49:41,270
two days ahead or like a month ahead, freak the fuck out and just spam. Because I, that might

649
01:49:41,270 --> 01:49:47,289
happen. I might change it to like 2020 accidentally. So keep me honest. All right. Here we go.

650
01:49:48,250 --> 01:50:02,489
313. Closed it up. How do you do that by accident? You've seen some of the dumb

651
01:50:02,489 --> 01:50:09,500
shit I've done on this stream. You're asking how I would do that by accident. Think of half the

652
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:13,979
stuff you've seen on this fucking camera on your television set here that you will like. How the

653
01:50:13,979 --> 01:50:22,840
fuck did he do that? It's very possible. All right. Let's go. Leonard Nimoy. How are we doing?

654
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:30,470
Updates. Change the date to 3019 and sell the game for $10 million.

655
01:50:31,430 --> 01:50:39,029
Welcome to the laboratory of Jean Paul Gasset. How are we? Greetings and welcome back.

656
01:50:39,829 --> 01:50:51,800
You're doing a good job. At the moment, the habitat contains four human. They are suffering

657
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:57,000
from the cold. Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable. Good,

658
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:03,850
not great. I'm doing a good job. Let us head over to the tank. How much more? Okay. I only have like

659
01:51:03,850 --> 01:51:17,909
eight more days of food. What happens after eight days? Save them all.

660
01:51:19,510 --> 01:51:56,819
Okay, let's get. Let's see what they say about the goody. Oh, goody. Oh, goody. Yay. Yay. Okay.

661
01:51:57,779 --> 01:52:13,350
About time. Yay. Goody. Goody. About time. It's been like 12 hours. I'm late. No, I'm fine. All

662
01:52:13,350 --> 01:52:24,409
right. Let's see how they're doing. Whoa. You look different. Hello. Hi. I can't breathe.

663
01:52:34,069 --> 01:52:44,890
How are you? How are you? Get off. What are you doing? Stop it. Stop that. Stop it. What's he

664
01:52:44,890 --> 01:52:58,010
doing? He's killing. He's cannibalizing his brother. Stop it. Hey, hey, what am I supposed to do about

665
01:52:58,010 --> 01:53:19,539
this? He's assimilating. He's like doing the Borg shit to his brother. No. No. Hey. Hello.

666
01:53:23,529 --> 01:53:31,539
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick. Heaven. Heaven. You English. Heaven. Everything's gonna be all

667
01:53:31,539 --> 01:54:08,069
right. Heaven. I don't know how to do. How do I? What was that for? Why? Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey, that

668
01:54:08,069 --> 01:54:23,619
hurts. Hey. Why? Hello. Hello. What are you doing? What are you doing? Seaman. Why did you eat your

669
01:54:23,619 --> 01:54:45,880
brother? Eat brother. English. English. You don't want to talk to me? My side hurts. Bad touch. Bad

670
01:54:45,880 --> 01:55:37,750
touch. Would you like to save and end the session? Okay. Anybody hungry? How was your day? That was

671
01:55:37,829 --> 01:55:53,909
tasty. Tasty. Tasty. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. What is your name? What is your name?

672
01:55:57,500 --> 01:56:08,630
Execute the murderer. I can't do that. What is your name? Is it the Boston accent doing it again?

673
01:56:10,199 --> 01:56:17,779
What is your name? What is your name? He doesn't want to listen to me. He's not paying attention

674
01:56:17,779 --> 01:56:28,090
to me. He doesn't want to listen to me. Hello. Hello. He, it's showing the indicator that he's

675
01:56:28,090 --> 01:56:35,770
hearing me. He just doesn't want to pay attention. Listen. You hurt my feelers.

676
01:56:40,710 --> 01:57:06,970
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Go eat brother. Eat brother. Hello. Why does nobody want

677
01:57:06,970 --> 01:57:27,460
to talk to me anymore? Cold. Cold? Can we get him out of here? This is fucking bad. No wonder they're

678
01:57:27,779 --> 01:57:32,899
don't want to talk and shit. Like literally this is a dead seaman floating down to the bottom. How

679
01:57:32,899 --> 01:57:39,220
do I get rid of him? How do I pick this up? This is bad. This is like fucking morbid and terrible.

680
01:57:39,220 --> 01:58:14,729
Get this out of here. Would you like to save and end the session? Starting over. Exchanging food.

681
01:58:14,729 --> 01:58:32,250
Living in harmony. Advice. Final pointers. The sanctity of life. How do I remove a dead fish

682
01:58:32,250 --> 01:58:43,880
from the tank? Grab and lift. Press X to transform the hand to grab while holding X. Press and hold

683
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:54,260
R to lift and grab seaman out of the tank. I can't do it. No. He's just gonna have to stay there dead.

684
01:58:56,630 --> 01:59:04,569
I'm sorry. All right. We're good on air. Everything's fine. Just whatever. I tried.

685
01:59:05,529 --> 01:59:21,989
How are you guys doing? Hello. Play. Play. Greetings and salutations. Greetings and salutations.

686
01:59:24,359 --> 01:59:43,800
Salutations. Greetings and salutations. Hello. Greetings and salutations. How was your day today?

687
01:59:45,159 --> 02:00:06,699
Guess. Guess. Very good. Good. Is that a dork? I can't feel my nose. This is terrible.

688
02:00:07,020 --> 02:00:09,500
I can't feel.

689
02:00:11,899 --> 02:00:26,060
Flick him. He's dead.

690
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:41,909
Is he alive? He's still talking. Are you still alive? Are you still alive?

691
02:00:44,920 --> 02:00:59,140
Oh my god. Hi. Raise the temperature. Hello there. No, it's blue. I'm good.

692
02:00:59,140 --> 02:01:02,180
Is it between 15 and 20? How much? How hot does it need to be?

693
02:01:02,340 --> 02:01:15,350
20. Isn't blue correct? It needs to be 40. No. No. Didn't it say that blue was correct?

694
02:01:24,340 --> 02:01:28,180
Yeah. No. This is correct. You're not gonna try to. You're not gonna debate me into

695
02:01:28,180 --> 02:01:35,770
fucking burning my fish alive. 20 is optimal. Yeah. Come on. Excuse me. They're good.

696
02:01:39,060 --> 02:01:50,340
Speak English. I don't like mornings. You don't like mornings? You don't like mornings?

697
02:01:51,220 --> 02:02:03,930
Do you like mornings? Fucking Garfield cat. Yeah, really. Hi Garfield. Garfield. Good.

698
02:02:04,729 --> 02:02:15,800
You like Garfield? Do you like Garfield? Seaman, seaman, seaman. Your name is Garfield.

699
02:02:19,140 --> 02:02:35,510
Your name is Garfield. What's your name? Guess. Garfield. Garfield is your name. Your name is

700
02:02:35,510 --> 02:03:00,699
Garfield. What up? What up? What up? Hey baby. That's not appropriate. It's fine. No it isn't.

701
02:03:02,659 --> 02:03:19,539
Good morning. You've seen every one of my interactions. Every single one. Don't tell me.

702
02:03:21,779 --> 02:03:34,409
How is your day? What's your name? Seaman. Your name is Garfield. Hey Garfield.

703
02:03:36,279 --> 02:03:49,750
Thanks Pookie. Hey Garfield. Hey Garfield. Good. I don't know why. All right they've eaten,

704
02:03:49,750 --> 02:04:03,779
right? Well he's eaten like three times. Chadfish versus the virgin streamer. Hi.

705
02:04:09,430 --> 02:04:22,420
Are you okay? I'm so mad. Why are you mad? You make me mad. Why? Why?

706
02:04:22,420 --> 02:04:39,100
Why? Why are you mad? Why are you mad? It's just a game. I'm upset. Why? Why are you mad?

707
02:04:43,960 --> 02:04:58,779
Settle down. You make me mad. That's enough. Relax. I'm upset. I'm very sorry. I'm sorry

708
02:04:58,859 --> 02:05:11,100
about that. No. Tired. You want to go to sleep? Do you want to go to sleep? Would you like to

709
02:05:11,100 --> 02:05:36,729
go to sleep? Look at that face. Okay. Turn on the lights. I'm scared of the dark. I'm scared of the

710
02:05:36,729 --> 02:06:01,220
dark. Where's your brother? Goodbye. I'm upset. Why is everybody upset with me? Well you keep

711
02:06:01,220 --> 02:06:09,350
leaving him for 12 hours. Should I come back in like three hours this time? Or what? You called

712
02:06:09,350 --> 02:06:29,100
him Garfield 40 times. Is that why he's pissed off? Food. Food. They've eaten. This is day three.

713
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:38,890
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. They've eaten. Did they eat? Maybe they didn't eat.

714
02:06:39,609 --> 02:06:49,140
No, they've eaten. No, they did. They ate. They ate. I know. Don't keep repeating words. Okay.

715
02:06:50,020 --> 02:06:53,659
I'll put up like a thesaurus and start saying different stuff.

716
02:06:56,279 --> 02:07:01,689
All right. How are we doing? Let's say goodbye. Let's get this to about like 1996.

717
02:07:05,140 --> 02:07:15,369
That looks good. Oxygen's up. Let's dim the lights a little. And let's go. See you tomorrow. Would

718
02:07:15,369 --> 02:07:32,949
you like to save and end the session? Hopefully you're both still alive. Let's see what happens.

719
02:07:37,989 --> 02:07:59,260
Ah. Do English lessons. There we go. 313. Let's make it 314. And make it so it's been less than

720
02:07:59,260 --> 02:08:15,960
that. 24 hours. 314. That's correct. 314. Let's go ahead and close it. Dreamcast is going to die

721
02:08:15,960 --> 02:08:36,220
before Seaman does. Read them green eggs in hand. Jeremy, do you have any gray hairs?

722
02:08:37,100 --> 02:08:46,899
I don't know. Probably not. I don't think so. I've had Kim examine my head a few times. Look good.

723
02:08:47,539 --> 02:08:57,529
Good evening. Welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul Gasset. Greetings and welcome back.

724
02:08:58,329 --> 02:09:04,260
You're doing a good job. It's 4 a.m. I look like I'm shitfaced after a night of partying.

725
02:09:04,260 --> 02:09:10,260
The Gilmen have begun to suck each other's blood using the tubes on their heads. Did you notice?

726
02:09:13,539 --> 02:09:20,659
The number of Gilmen has decreased due to natural selection. It seems cruel, but survival of the

727
02:09:20,659 --> 02:09:32,779
fittest is an integral part of their lives. At the moment, the habitat contains two Gilmen.

728
02:09:35,399 --> 02:09:40,039
They are suffering from the cold. They always are. Please use the heater to raise the temperature

729
02:09:40,039 --> 02:09:49,770
to a more comfortable level. Allow me to give you the highlights for today. Highlights? I'm not sure,

730
02:09:49,770 --> 02:09:55,449
but it seems that Seaman wants a name. Pay close attention to what he says.

731
02:09:56,409 --> 02:10:09,800
So let us head over to the tank. This is important. All right. Garfield and Garfield and,

732
02:10:10,600 --> 02:10:35,510
I don't know, Greg, right, right, right, right, right. Here we go. No longer a baby. It's getting

733
02:10:35,510 --> 02:10:46,819
cold. Turn the heat up. I will. Don't worry. So one of these two is going to eat each other.

734
02:10:46,819 --> 02:11:17,350
Oh, goody. It's about time. That's much better. Is that George Takai? It might be. Slow down. Don't

735
02:11:17,350 --> 02:11:30,140
go too hot. All right. That's good. So how are we doing? Let's take a look. Hello. Yeah. Hello.

736
02:11:30,939 --> 02:11:44,539
Whatever. What's wrong? I must say you've taken very good care of me up to this point.

737
02:11:46,649 --> 02:12:03,319
Thank you. No, leave me alone. I heard you wanted a name. What is your name? What is your name?

738
02:12:04,279 --> 02:12:22,779
What's your favorite color? It's not children anymore. Hey. Let's take it down a notch, huh?

739
02:12:24,060 --> 02:12:47,859
Hey. Hey. Hi. I love you. What? It's rather difficult making out what's on the other side of

740
02:12:47,939 --> 02:12:58,500
this glass. So let me inquire. Are you a male or a female? Male. You're a male of the species,

741
02:12:58,500 --> 02:13:07,220
eh? Okay. Yes. Well, I was hoping to meet a lady, but I guess I'm not in a position to be too

742
02:13:07,220 --> 02:13:27,739
choosy, am I? Not really. I probably should feed. Are you hungry? No. Leave me alone.

743
02:13:29,800 --> 02:13:40,170
Do you want to play? What do you want? So I was led to believe I would be cared for by a fairly

744
02:13:40,170 --> 02:13:47,770
young, responsible human being. Right. So far this has proven to be true, but I am wondering

745
02:13:47,770 --> 02:14:02,380
about your age now. Tell me, are you in your 20s? No. Oh. Hmm. That hurts. Well, then perhaps you

746
02:14:02,380 --> 02:14:16,890
are a teenager. Is this correct? No. All right. I'm tired of guessing. How old are you then? 33.

747
02:14:18,279 --> 02:14:29,539
You're 33 years old? Yes. Yes. A 30 something. The body doesn't feel as good the next day after a

748
02:14:29,539 --> 02:14:40,739
night of revelry. You can't stay up as late. It's tough growing old, huh? Yeah. You got that spot on.

749
02:14:41,699 --> 02:14:48,550
What is it? So what month is your birthday in?

750
02:14:50,550 --> 02:14:56,229
Are you going to dox me? Where do you live? What month is your birthday? What's your mother's maiden

751
02:14:56,229 --> 02:15:06,899
name? September. So what's your answer? Let's try that last question I had for you before again,

752
02:15:06,979 --> 02:15:17,539
shall we? So what month is your birthday in? September. You were born in September? Yes.

753
02:15:18,819 --> 02:15:26,819
You know, autumn babies are often melancholy adults. Not that I mean to imply anything. I'm

754
02:15:26,819 --> 02:15:31,380
just saying- He's talking to a 33 year old fucking- No, I've stuck my fin in my mouth. Melancholy guy.

755
02:15:31,380 --> 02:15:44,649
He's just kind of roasting me. All I have is he's just destroying me with this like

756
02:15:44,649 --> 02:15:49,050
fucking fax and all this awful shit and I'm just like, what's your favorite color? What's your

757
02:15:49,050 --> 02:16:03,020
favorite food? I've got to- Hey, what's your birthday? July 29, 1999. That's odd considering

758
02:16:03,020 --> 02:16:15,319
you're only three days old. That's very weird. What are your aspirations? What are your goals?

759
02:16:17,300 --> 02:16:32,229
What do you like? Hey, why all the noise? What do you like? What do you like? Yes. So

760
02:16:33,430 --> 02:16:50,809
what day is your birthday on? All right, let's try that one more time. What day were you born?

761
02:16:53,819 --> 02:17:03,610
Let's think about what you said, shall we? I'm just gonna get my like name, my birthday, the fourth.

762
02:17:05,379 --> 02:17:23,190
Let's take it down a notch, huh? Anyways, how has your day been? No, go away. Fine, I'm gonna do the

763
02:17:23,190 --> 02:17:29,670
streamer joke. Are you ready? You all here? There's almost 6,000 people here. I will do the fucking

764
02:17:29,670 --> 02:17:47,780
streamer joke, the YouTuber joke. Here we go. Fuck you. You can go away. It's really not a difficult

765
02:17:47,780 --> 02:18:02,489
question. I said, so what day is your birthday on? Fourth. What's all that racket? I said the fourth.

766
02:18:09,739 --> 02:18:20,760
I thought I'm like not paying any attention to the brother. He's gonna- he's gonna fucking

767
02:18:20,760 --> 02:18:29,420
borg this motherfucker anyways. Who cares? This is our seaman. What is your name? Seaman. Seaman

768
02:18:29,579 --> 02:18:41,719
Jones. It's really not a difficult question. I said, so what day is your birthday on?

769
02:18:42,920 --> 02:18:52,739
Four. The fourth? Yes. Well, I'm sorry, but don't expect any presents from me, okay?

770
02:18:53,459 --> 02:19:04,940
I'm just a poor seaman trying to make ends meet. Liar. Are you hungry? No, thanks.

771
02:19:05,579 --> 02:19:11,049
Can I still like pet him? Or is this like- is he gonna be- is it like-

772
02:19:18,600 --> 02:19:19,639
Don't make me laugh.

773
02:19:22,600 --> 02:19:38,739
I'm gonna pee if you don't stop. I don't know what to say. I thought he wanted a name.

774
02:19:40,979 --> 02:19:52,840
Pick him up. I'm not gonna- no, I don't want him to hate me. Good afternoon. No, it's not. What time is

775
02:19:52,840 --> 02:20:05,860
it? Hello? What time is it? Now, where on earth do you think I could wear a wristwatch?

776
02:20:08,940 --> 02:20:13,340
Decrease the oxygen in the water, but don't do enough to kill him. Just starve his brain of IQ.

777
02:20:13,340 --> 02:20:20,469
That's fucking diabolical. What is wrong with you? Drop the oxygen in the tank to starve his

778
02:20:20,469 --> 02:20:36,280
brain of oxygen so his IQ drops. I will name you. I will name you. So what are you looking at me for?

779
02:20:38,860 --> 02:20:45,020
I want to name- I've been thinking about this, and if my calculations are correct,

780
02:20:45,020 --> 02:20:53,579
you must be a virgin, right? I meant Virgo. Sorry, I know Virgos are very sensitive.

781
02:20:53,579 --> 02:20:59,100
I hope I didn't hurt your feelings. No, I'm not, so sorry. Honestly, it's none of my business what

782
02:20:59,100 --> 02:21:06,579
you do in your free time. Hey, no, what's up? No, I'm not a virgin, actually. What about you?

783
02:21:07,700 --> 02:21:17,899
What about you? I am Seaman. Applause, please. Because to me, you're kind of just been in a

784
02:21:17,899 --> 02:21:27,129
tank this whole time, decimated by Chad Jones. No, actually, he gave me a false statement,

785
02:21:27,129 --> 02:21:30,489
and I threw it right back in this tank, and he doesn't even want to respond.

786
02:21:34,489 --> 02:21:45,540
What's up? All right, let's see the other ones as much as a dick. Where is the other one? Up here.

787
02:21:46,790 --> 02:22:09,940
Hey. Hi there. Hello. Hello. Hello. This one doesn't want to talk. Are you there? Are you there? Okay,

788
02:22:09,940 --> 02:22:16,819
this one's dumb. He just swam his head into a pole. I think this one's just food. Yeah,

789
02:22:16,819 --> 02:22:39,459
this one's just food. Let's get the heat up a little. Try it one more time. Good morning. Good

790
02:22:39,459 --> 02:22:56,569
morning. Ow, knock it off. Are you awake? Excuse me. What's the problem? Finally, Jesus. What is

791
02:22:56,569 --> 02:23:09,260
your name? Seaman. Seaman Jones. You both can't be Seaman. That's not your name. I am Seaman. Hear

792
02:23:09,260 --> 02:23:20,120
me roar. You are not. That was interesting. We'll speak again soon. Is that me telling me that he

793
02:23:20,120 --> 02:23:32,569
doesn't want to talk to me anymore? What do you want to be when you grow up? What's up? What do

794
02:23:32,649 --> 02:23:38,020
you want to be when you grow up? No, leave me alone.

795
02:23:49,510 --> 02:24:10,090
Okay, we're good. Anybody hungry before I go? No, not yet. Okay, so let's go.

796
02:24:11,860 --> 02:24:15,219
He said he's not hungry. Feed? I guess I have to, right? I'm gonna be gone for a while.

797
02:24:16,100 --> 02:24:22,379
I'm still full. Are you trying to fatten me for slaughter?

798
02:24:22,620 --> 02:24:31,719
Pick it back up. Sorry, sorry. Just leave, leave, leave, leave. Get out. Would you like to save and-

799
02:24:32,360 --> 02:24:38,329
Tomorrow. Next day. I'm completely invested in this now. I need to know everything about it.

800
02:24:38,809 --> 02:24:55,930
All right, let's try again. Okay, so this is technically, this is going on five days game time,

801
02:24:55,930 --> 02:25:10,040
right? I think. Should be, right? 315. No, no, no, no, no. Back it up.

802
02:25:10,040 --> 02:25:25,129
When do we start? I don't remember, like the 10th? We started, I've lost track of time. I don't even

803
02:25:25,129 --> 02:25:33,420
know what day it is now in real life. The 10th, right? This is playing with my brain. All right,

804
02:25:33,420 --> 02:25:49,239
here we go. See if any of the new developments. This whole game is an elaborate phishing scam.

805
02:25:49,239 --> 02:26:05,379
In a few days, the seaman will access your bank account info. What happens if you set time

806
02:26:05,379 --> 02:26:11,909
backwards? That's a really good question. I have no idea. Would the game just break?

807
02:26:12,790 --> 02:26:15,780
Or would they revert back to eggs? Good evening.

808
02:26:17,780 --> 02:26:26,969
Welcome to the laboratory of Jean Paul Gasset. Greetings and welcome back. You're doing a good

809
02:26:26,969 --> 02:26:39,190
job. At the moment, the habitat contains two gill men. They appear to be very hungry.

810
02:26:42,729 --> 02:26:50,600
Let me divulge the highlights for today. Would you like to give seaman a name? Call one of the

811
02:26:50,600 --> 02:26:56,280
gill men and try saying, I will give you a name. I will give you a name. So let us head over to

812
02:26:56,280 --> 02:27:12,620
the tank. So I have to feed immediately. Greg and Garfield, yeah. Chad, no, that's too easy.

813
02:27:20,139 --> 02:27:29,139
I'm hungry. All right, just eat. Give me something to eat. I'm starved. Hey, thanks.

814
02:27:30,579 --> 02:27:37,540
Where's the other one? Turn it on again. The other one didn't get to eat.

815
02:27:38,340 --> 02:27:44,059
Do I have to drop another one in there? The other one?

816
02:27:48,940 --> 02:28:10,020
How about turning up the heat? Peaceful. It's heated up. So he ate this one over here on the right.

817
02:28:10,979 --> 02:28:34,840
Now we're good. Slow it down. That should stop at about 19 something. Hey. Hi. Shouldn't you be out

818
02:28:35,559 --> 02:28:42,680
partying or something? I mean, this is technically a party. I will give you a name.

819
02:28:45,270 --> 02:28:51,510
Okay, I'm going to let you give me a name. When you've decided what you want to call me, say,

820
02:28:51,510 --> 02:28:59,829
I'm ready. I'm ready. All right, then. Here's how to do it. You're going to say my new name

821
02:28:59,829 --> 02:29:11,590
three times. Each time I say now, say the name once. Got it? Now. Greg. One more time. Greg.

822
02:29:12,950 --> 02:29:21,510
One more time. Greg. Okay, I'll remember that. Next time you want to call me, call me using that

823
02:29:21,510 --> 02:29:27,989
name. And don't forget the name you gave me. Because if you do, I'm not going to tell you

824
02:29:27,989 --> 02:29:40,649
what it is. Well, I think that pretty much covers it later. Hey, Greg. Greg. Okay, just be sure to

825
02:29:40,649 --> 02:29:53,260
save some for later. What? All right, now I gotta give you a name. I will give you a name. I will

826
02:29:53,260 --> 02:30:08,280
give you a name. I will give you a name. Hey. Hey. Food. Here. No, why? He's gonna become food

827
02:30:08,280 --> 02:30:20,360
and he's gonna be eaten by his brother. Why is this one the smork? Go get it. Oh, good. Food.

828
02:30:23,129 --> 02:30:47,860
Right here. Now will you talk? There you go. Okay. Hi. I will give you a name. I will give you a name.

829
02:30:49,059 --> 02:31:10,420
My compliments to the chef. I'm gonna pee if you don't stop. Listen. Listen. Not right now.

830
02:31:14,440 --> 02:31:22,920
You are the dumb one. You're the dumb one. And you are just food for your brother. I just want to

831
02:31:22,920 --> 02:31:28,700
make sure you're aware of that. I have to make it very clear. You are in this tank to provide

832
02:31:28,700 --> 02:31:58,469
sustenance to the smart one. Doesn't seem to care. Hey, you hungry? Greg. Greg. Hey, Greg.

833
02:32:00,340 --> 02:32:18,090
What do you want? Greg, come over here. Does he pee? Do they actually pee?

834
02:32:19,610 --> 02:32:33,930
I'm gonna pee if you don't stop. Don't make me laugh. Be nice to your brother. Can't see

835
02:32:34,010 --> 02:32:45,370
anything. I share a name with the seaman so it's throwing me off. Hey, Greg. Greg. That would be

836
02:32:45,370 --> 02:32:57,530
really weird. Clean the tank? The only way you clean the tank is you just put air in it. Hey, Greg.

837
02:33:00,819 --> 02:33:11,340
Greg. Great. Now everyone will want one. What one? What are you talking about? Greg. What the fuck is that?

838
02:33:11,340 --> 02:33:37,799
Adieu. What the hell is this? What is that? Is it an egg? What is this? Whose egg is this? Put this

839
02:33:37,799 --> 02:33:49,940
tongue in that mouth. Dream on. That's poop? Uh, there's no way that's poop. That did not...

840
02:33:50,979 --> 02:33:54,899
A big brick cement shit like that did not come out of one of these things.

841
02:33:55,620 --> 02:34:15,819
There's an egg. That's a big ball of shit, okay? Let's play. Hey, Greg. Hey, settle down there.

842
02:34:16,700 --> 02:34:27,260
Let's play. Do you want to play? I could use a hug. Okay, that's all I needed to hear.

843
02:34:32,649 --> 02:34:46,649
Quit it. Quit it. It hurts. English. I'm not ignoring you. I'm thinking. What are you thinking

844
02:34:46,649 --> 02:35:13,190
about? Hello. What are you thinking about? It's a secret. Okay. Tell me. What's up? America. America.

845
02:35:14,870 --> 02:35:26,600
Look who's talking. Do you like America? You can go away. Remember when you were like

846
02:35:27,319 --> 02:35:32,120
12 years old in a chat room for the first time? You went into like the international chat room?

847
02:35:32,920 --> 02:35:41,700
And you literally just wrote, do you like America? And they're like, yeah, I guess. Yeah.

848
02:35:41,700 --> 02:35:55,379
And they're like, do you like Japan? And you're like, yeah. You guys didn't do that? You guys...

849
02:35:55,379 --> 02:36:00,500
Wait, that's because I was... Okay, my means of chat room. You guys don't understand this.

850
02:36:00,500 --> 02:36:04,819
You have like a Twitch chat room right now. You've got all kinds of forums. You've got like Reddit.

851
02:36:05,379 --> 02:36:13,000
Back in my day, we had Diablo II battle net and like wrestling fucking chat rooms. That's all there

852
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:36,649
was. I didn't have a Twitch chat. I had a Diablo II chat in a random battle net server. It was

853
02:36:36,649 --> 02:36:44,739
incredible to talk to somebody on the other side of the world back then. It was. And kids these days

854
02:36:44,739 --> 02:36:55,399
don't even realize. When you talk to somebody from Japan 20 years ago, it was like boom. Your

855
02:36:55,399 --> 02:37:10,340
brain just could not comprehend it. Let's have a conversation. Let's talk. No, I'm all talked out

856
02:37:10,340 --> 02:37:18,860
for today. Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. Goodbye. Bye bye. Don't eat your brother while I'm gone.

857
02:37:20,649 --> 02:37:32,120
No, leave me alone. Good. We are reaching critical boomer. Goodbye. Goodbye,

858
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:40,709
food. That's really mean and fucked up. All right, I'll see you tomorrow. Let's go. Would you like to

859
02:37:40,709 --> 02:37:54,360
save and it was crazy. If you were back in the day, if you were on the internet and somebody

860
02:37:54,360 --> 02:38:01,270
picked up the telephone, it would the whole thing would break. It's got their Instagram and their

861
02:38:01,270 --> 02:38:15,670
Twitter. You start to go to a pay. I'm sorry. I forgot to turn it off. Sorry for the blue. I'm

862
02:38:15,670 --> 02:38:23,129
sorry. Yeah, back. I couldn't make a phone call from a device in my pocket. I had to go to a

863
02:38:23,129 --> 02:38:35,850
pay phone and put in a quarter. I have Twitter. Yeah, but I tweet like once every three weeks.

864
02:38:36,489 --> 02:38:43,750
All right, let's go. That looks all right. Let's go to like four for two in the morning.

865
02:38:49,860 --> 02:38:55,129
Wrong date. We talked about it. That's fine. 316. That's the Stone Cold number.

866
02:39:06,219 --> 02:39:13,690
I wish I could have experienced the dawn of the internet like you. It was pretty weird.

867
02:39:14,250 --> 02:39:31,110
I remember playing Command and Conquer. Red alert. Neighbors. It was wild. It was a weird time. Yeah,

868
02:39:31,110 --> 02:39:35,590
you just build power plants into the other person's base and then send 20 tonyas over

869
02:39:35,590 --> 02:39:44,299
there. That was the strategy every time. Greetings and welcome back. You're doing a good job.

870
02:39:47,899 --> 02:39:52,700
First, a recap of your previous visit. You have given a name to one of the Gilmen.

871
02:39:53,500 --> 02:40:01,420
His coloration has changed, so you should be able to locate him easily. Please take good care of him.

872
02:40:01,420 --> 02:40:07,959
So that's the one that we have to take care of. Oh, yes. They have started to produce droppings.

873
02:40:08,920 --> 02:40:21,590
The tubes on their heads serve many purposes. At the moment, the habitat contains two Gilmen.

874
02:40:21,590 --> 02:40:25,590
That's weird. They have a forehead butthole. They are suffering from the cold.

875
02:40:26,389 --> 02:40:30,229
Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level. They like poop out of the

876
02:40:30,229 --> 02:40:33,430
top of their head. So let us head over to the tank. Somebody just said shit for brains.

877
02:40:34,389 --> 02:40:55,270
It's cold in here. Please increase the temperature.

878
02:40:58,469 --> 02:41:01,750
I thought I was definitely going to suffocate for a minute there.

879
02:41:03,590 --> 02:41:42,329
Hey sup, boomer. Hey sup. Yay. It's the movie phone voice. Oh my god, I forgot about the movie

880
02:41:42,329 --> 02:41:48,329
phone voice. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press 1. If you know the name

881
02:41:48,329 --> 02:41:52,649
of the movie you'd like to see, press 2. Holy shit, that's so old. Is that guy still alive?

882
02:41:53,370 --> 02:42:01,420
Hey you. You used to have to do that. You had to call a fucking service on the phone to find out

883
02:42:01,420 --> 02:42:08,569
what time the movie was playing. You know how easy you've got it now? We had to listen to a weird

884
02:42:08,569 --> 02:42:17,379
robot guy give us every movie that was playing in the theater. Unbelievable how easy it is for you.

885
02:42:18,819 --> 02:42:22,659
I used to have to walk to a pay phone and call movie phone. It was two and a half miles.

886
02:42:26,790 --> 02:42:34,069
Okay, don't answer me. What did he say? Greetings and salutations my good friend.

887
02:42:34,069 --> 02:42:45,590
How are you? Hello. Well hello. I'm thinking about some food, eh? You got it.

888
02:42:47,770 --> 02:43:12,020
Food coming in hot. Hey, thanks. You're welcome. What's your name? Hello. Oh yummy,

889
02:43:12,020 --> 02:43:18,579
baity goodness. Well you are the bait so that's true. Did you eat it? Okay, you have to eat too.

890
02:43:20,659 --> 02:43:27,030
Technically I am a millennial. I know I'm a millennial. I know that. I want the recipe for

891
02:43:27,030 --> 02:43:34,149
whatever that was. It's called molded together oats and like soy sauce probably. I don't know.

892
02:43:34,149 --> 02:43:39,190
What is, how do you make fish food? It's like soy sauce and rolled oats and they crush it up

893
02:43:39,190 --> 02:43:51,340
and blend it up and put it in a like salt shaker. Good morning. Hey, why all the noise? I'm sorry.

894
02:43:53,340 --> 02:44:05,110
So what did you do today? What's up? What did you do today? What do you want?

895
02:44:05,829 --> 02:44:15,270
Do you have any questions? Do you have any questions? Hey, hey, I've got something to say.

896
02:44:16,229 --> 02:44:23,780
Hello. I just remembered something. Some of my memories are coming back. What is going on?

897
02:44:23,780 --> 02:44:29,379
We're gonna get cut scene? There was this French man named Jean Paul Gasset who was trying to

898
02:44:29,379 --> 02:44:36,979
raise me and he made this cage to hold insects and there were a lot of really tasty looking

899
02:44:36,979 --> 02:44:45,299
insects in it. Is it still there? Can you take a look? Okay, so after a while some moth larva

900
02:44:45,299 --> 02:44:51,940
will start growing in there. When that happens, use the L trigger to switch screens and grab a

901
02:44:51,940 --> 02:45:38,059
larva and drop it in here. Can you do that for me? Yeah. Yes. So these not ready yet? That's wrong?

902
02:45:38,860 --> 02:45:49,579
That's an egg. Oh, fuck. What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? How do I fix this? How do I fix

903
02:45:49,579 --> 02:45:54,979
that? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? Can I get more of those? Do I have to reset? I

904
02:45:54,979 --> 02:46:14,299
can't reset. There's no resetting in this game. I can't pick it back up. I still have one.

905
02:46:15,579 --> 02:46:20,860
Unplug the console. It's fine. Okay. You can get more. You just need to water the other seed and

906
02:46:20,860 --> 02:46:39,129
it makes more. Okay. Cool. Moisten the cage. Spray. How much do I have to spray? More spray?

907
02:46:41,459 --> 02:47:14,469
It's red. Okay. It's good. Can I go? Can I overspray? Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

908
02:47:14,469 --> 02:47:20,729
I'm overspraying. Okay. No, that's it. It's already dead. It's not, there's no, it's not even,

909
02:47:20,729 --> 02:47:30,389
it's already dead. All right. What does anyone want to know? Let's talk. Hey. Let's take it down a notch,

910
02:47:30,389 --> 02:47:43,899
huh? Any questions? Yes. Do you have any questions? Let's have a conversation.

911
02:47:49,450 --> 02:48:06,950
I will give you a name. What's up? I will give you a name. I will give you a name.

912
02:48:08,069 --> 02:48:21,290
I will give you a name. That's not Greg. I'm thinking about some food, eh?

913
02:48:34,489 --> 02:48:48,469
Greg, no, Greg is over here. What's up? Okay. Let's talk about, no, maybe tomorrow. What the

914
02:48:48,549 --> 02:49:09,379
fuck? Today. Hey, thanks. What are you doing? What is he doing? Let's talk today. Tomorrow.

915
02:49:09,379 --> 02:49:21,110
We'll talk again tomorrow. Let's talk today. Oh my god. If the larva things die, you have to start

916
02:49:21,110 --> 02:49:32,329
over again. So make sure that this is always up to, up to being sprayed. So these are eggs and I have

917
02:49:32,329 --> 02:49:43,989
to pick up the larva and feed. So I gotta be very careful about that. 100 spray, 100 spray.

918
02:49:46,899 --> 02:49:52,579
I can't, I don't want to mess that up. Okay. Let's go back. Just turn the heat up a little.

919
02:49:54,170 --> 02:50:02,899
We'll talk tomorrow. We'll talk tomorrow. Always make sure there's at least one egg

920
02:50:02,899 --> 02:50:09,059
or larva in at all times and do not mess with the seeds. Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

921
02:50:09,059 --> 02:50:19,959
too hot, too hot, too hot, too hot, too hot. Cool it down. That's enough. That's fine. It'll be all

922
02:50:19,959 --> 02:50:34,520
right. Goodbye. All right. Next day. I didn't kill one of them. What are you talking about?

923
02:50:40,489 --> 02:50:58,940
No. Okay. You just get the shit out of me. Goodbye. Bye bye. Oh no, he's immune.

924
02:51:00,459 --> 02:51:03,530
I'm gonna pee if you don't stop. Sayonara.

925
02:51:09,639 --> 02:51:17,860
Hello. Goodbye. Good night. But I'm not tired. I was gonna scream go to bed as

926
02:51:17,860 --> 02:51:21,540
loud as I could, but that was a bad idea. All right. Here we go. We got air light.

927
02:51:21,540 --> 02:51:26,459
Let's dim it a little. See you tomorrow. Would you like to save and

928
02:51:31,670 --> 02:51:36,920
peek, Mike? The other one's not an adult. When you name him, it makes him an adult. At least

929
02:51:36,920 --> 02:51:41,879
that's what the guide says. Yeah. Every time I try to name that fish, it just doesn't,

930
02:51:41,879 --> 02:51:48,340
doesn't want to do it. All right. Make sure I don't get you a blow. Get the blue.

931
02:51:49,219 --> 02:52:01,559
There we are. Let's go. One more day. Another day. More evolution. Uh, that is Leonard Nimoy.

932
02:52:01,559 --> 02:52:12,620
That's correct. That is Spock. What the fuck just happened? That is the Spider-Man down

933
02:52:12,620 --> 02:52:27,930
the top of my mic. 317. 2019. Like, let's go like 11 30 or so. 317. Man, this would have been a

934
02:52:27,930 --> 02:52:38,170
pain in the ass. You would have to play this for a week to get this far. That's way too long.

935
02:52:39,620 --> 02:52:45,129
That's more than 24 hours. Wait, what? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

936
02:52:45,129 --> 02:52:57,399
317. That's 11 39. What are you talking about? All right. Because it's okay. All right. All right.

937
02:52:57,399 --> 02:53:05,260
That is way too long. How about it? Like 130. That's almost two days. That's good.

938
02:53:10,569 --> 02:53:18,840
You can do up to two days. Yeah, but I don't want to do that. So it was just 316 at like one or two

939
02:53:18,840 --> 02:53:30,520
AM. Now it's 317 at like one AM. One 30. They're not going to be dead. That's fine. Cause it was

940
02:53:30,520 --> 02:53:38,120
like three AM before I just itched my nose and my nose and my nostril got stuck for a full second.

941
02:53:38,120 --> 02:53:43,479
I don't know if it, did anybody see that happen? I went like this and the nostril was closed and

942
02:53:43,479 --> 02:53:49,370
then opened by itself a second later. It was really weird. All right. That's fine. I'm going

943
02:53:49,370 --> 02:54:04,889
to go with 130 thoughts on killing the seaman. Why would I do that? All right. 317 at one 30 AM.

944
02:54:05,690 --> 02:54:09,930
I want to see what I just want to see. I'm going to like zoom in and look. I'm actually curious

945
02:54:09,930 --> 02:54:29,459
to how fucking weird that looked. I didn't, no, it didn't do anything. I thought that was way more

946
02:54:29,459 --> 02:54:43,750
interesting than it was. All right. Let's go close it up. I was going to do with like my feet. I was

947
02:54:43,750 --> 02:54:47,989
going for an hour. Did he starve the seaman yet? No, they do. I got two. They're doing very well.

948
02:54:47,989 --> 02:55:20,260
They're both doing just fine. Bye. Fuck. Good evening. Welcome to the laboratory of

949
02:55:20,260 --> 02:55:31,899
Jean Paul Garcet. Greetings and welcome back. You're doing a good job. Oh, my mouth. Let's see.

950
02:55:32,780 --> 02:55:39,020
You have obtained the insect cage. This will be helpful in raising more food for seaman.

951
02:55:40,149 --> 02:55:47,350
Keep your eye on it. Something will happen within shortly. Okay. Oh, the spray.

952
02:55:48,469 --> 02:55:54,549
The insect cage is equipped with a spray to keep the moisture level up. Please don't forget to use

953
02:55:54,549 --> 02:56:08,739
it. At the moment, the habitat contains two gill men. They appear to be very hungry.

954
02:56:12,459 --> 02:56:20,010
Allow me to divulge today's highlights. Gil man has been growing and would love some variety in

955
02:56:20,010 --> 02:56:26,329
his meals. Try giving him some larva from the other tank. I'm sure he'll be pleased.

956
02:56:27,290 --> 02:56:38,739
So let us head over to the tank. Start lifting the weights of loser. Quiet. Remember 33. If you

957
02:56:38,739 --> 02:56:45,399
were to guess my age right now, what would you think? Jeremy? Wow. I mean, I would have guessed

958
02:56:45,399 --> 02:56:56,379
like 25. 24. Really? Double threes. I'm doing just fine. You understand? I'm doing just fine.

959
02:56:57,350 --> 02:57:03,020
Double threes. Don't fucking look at that. That's so embarrassing. What a fucking idiot.

960
02:57:03,979 --> 02:57:07,420
Give me something to eat. No, I'm a human. I sweat. That's what people do.

961
02:57:07,420 --> 02:57:26,139
Relax. We're all humans. I'm older than Jesus. I don't, I can't, of what context are you talking

962
02:57:27,100 --> 02:57:32,729
about? It's hilarious you kids talking shit about Jeremy. You wouldn't say this to him at land.

963
02:57:35,399 --> 02:57:40,200
I don't go to lands. I'm good enough to participate in the land. So you probably

964
02:57:40,200 --> 02:57:58,709
wouldn't see me there. Hey, listen. Oh, goodie. Larva time. Other than your weird forehead window,

965
02:57:58,709 --> 02:58:07,260
you look great for your age. What's a forehead window? Your forehead window? Oh, good. I'm

966
02:58:07,260 --> 02:58:12,149
feeling a little warmer. I'm starving to death. I don't know what that means.

967
02:58:13,959 --> 02:58:18,200
Okay, finless wonder. Joke's over. Feed. Okay, let's get some food in here.

968
02:58:19,319 --> 02:58:35,340
Why is there no egg here? How do I get an egg? Guys? Egg? How? Are you going to starve me to death?

969
02:58:36,139 --> 02:58:44,309
Feed me right now. Well, come eat. Hey, thanks for the food. Go eat it.

970
02:58:45,030 --> 02:58:57,799
Yeah, this really is the monster rancher monster. Okay, so you fed. Is it still alive? Oh, good.

971
02:58:57,799 --> 02:59:05,100
Food. The seed sprouted into a little plant. You can eat this too? All right, thank god. I want

972
02:59:05,100 --> 02:59:12,069
the recipe for whatever that was. All right, let me go back here and see this. It has a seed now.

973
02:59:13,190 --> 02:59:20,739
There's a little plant there, so I need to spray. So will these things? I've never gotten here.

974
02:59:21,540 --> 02:59:25,139
So if I spray, these things will all stay alive and that plant will grow.

975
02:59:34,059 --> 02:59:48,090
Always leave one of them in here. Okay. Yeah, the plant will feed larva. Okay. So always leave one

976
02:59:48,090 --> 02:59:57,860
bug. Always. Always. Okay. So they've been fed today. So that's good. You guys are good to go.

977
03:00:00,090 --> 03:00:08,409
So let's chat. Where'd you go? Are we good? Make it a little hotter. Talk to the bugs. Hey, you.

978
03:00:12,790 --> 03:00:26,950
I'm back. Let's chat. Bonjour. Happy St. Patrick's Day. Beware of green beer.

979
03:00:28,149 --> 03:00:42,549
I forgot we were teleporting forward in time. Happy St. Patrick's Day. Like the spice. Let's chat.

980
03:00:48,579 --> 03:00:56,260
Tell me, what do you do for a living? Streamer. You're an athlete?

981
03:00:56,340 --> 03:01:07,190
No. Well, then what do you do for a living? Actor. Let's take it down a notch, huh?

982
03:01:08,149 --> 03:01:27,479
He knows. He knows that was horseshit. Let's chat. Let me start over. I said,

983
03:01:28,760 --> 03:01:37,180
tell me, what do you do for a living? Clown. Okay, I'm going to try this once more.

984
03:01:37,340 --> 03:01:44,569
Once more. What do you do for a living? Clown. You're a plumber?

985
03:01:47,909 --> 03:01:52,870
Yes. Perhaps you can tell us all what shoes go with a tool belt.

986
03:01:55,829 --> 03:02:15,799
Close enough. I'm a clown plumber. What do you want? Let's chat. Well, I could go on and on and

987
03:02:16,360 --> 03:02:23,899
so I'd better stop right now. It's been a pleasure. Saving. What did it save? The fact that he said he...

988
03:02:26,069 --> 03:02:40,180
How old are you? How old are you? Well, aren't we rude? I will rip you from this tank,

989
03:02:41,270 --> 03:02:48,629
put you in a pan with a coat of butter on it, sear both sides, and serve you to a rich family

990
03:02:48,629 --> 03:03:10,329
at a rich restaurant if you don't start talking to me. He don't fucking care. Anything else?

991
03:03:13,799 --> 03:03:33,590
What's up? Greg. Greg. Goodbye. Greg, what's up, dude? Word. Greg, can you sing? Sing me a song.

992
03:03:34,309 --> 03:03:46,200
Did I tell you guys that I walked... Would you like to save and end the session?

993
03:03:46,200 --> 03:03:53,510
I didn't tell you this yet. I walked to auto yesterday and I saw him. I saw the car. I saw

994
03:03:53,510 --> 03:04:13,479
exactly who it was. Described the car. It had... All you need to know is, yes, it had a racing

995
03:04:13,479 --> 03:04:21,639
stripe on the top. That's all you need to know because of course it does. Would you like to

996
03:04:21,639 --> 03:04:25,879
save and end the session? Yes. I fucking... I couldn't get the license plate so I like...

997
03:04:26,200 --> 03:04:32,940
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. I didn't catch it though. He was going like 50. I could only run

998
03:04:32,940 --> 03:04:43,850
like 30 or 40 so... All right. Anything else you got? Let's have a conversation. Let's have a

999
03:04:43,850 --> 03:04:57,940
conversation. What? What do you think of humans? What do you want? What do you think of humans?

1000
03:05:00,379 --> 03:05:12,139
Let's talk. Let's talk. No, I'm done for today. This is the original Clash of Clans.

1001
03:05:13,780 --> 03:05:21,159
I gotta come back and play tomorrow. Can I like drop some fucking gems in here?

1002
03:05:23,940 --> 03:05:38,360
Good night. Hey, why all the noise? Greg, let's talk. Greg. Bu-bye. Greg. Greg. Remember to chew.

1003
03:05:40,790 --> 03:05:48,170
Change your console's clock. What the fuck was that? Yeah, we've been changing. I've been going a

1004
03:05:48,170 --> 03:05:58,889
week. Did he just shit? All right, let's make sure everything's good to go. Talk to the brother. I

1005
03:05:58,889 --> 03:06:02,979
keep trying to. The brother doesn't want anything to do with me. Every time I try to initiate a

1006
03:06:02,979 --> 03:06:29,110
conversation, he just doesn't say anything. Hi. Hello. Yo. Yo. Yo. Yes. Listen. Are you listening

1007
03:06:29,110 --> 03:07:05,579
to me? Are you listening to me? I will give you a name. I will name you. I'm just trying to get his

1008
03:07:05,579 --> 03:07:18,010
attention. Hello. No, this one doesn't talk. What? Quit it. Hello. It hurts. What's up? What's going

1009
03:07:18,010 --> 03:07:23,610
on? He doesn't want to even. What do you want? He won't even respond to anything I'm saying.

1010
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:35,690
Let's talk. No, I'm done for today. Oh my god, of course you are. Pick him up. Stop it. Let me go.

1011
03:07:35,770 --> 03:07:44,489
What are you doing? Let me go. Talk to me. Come on. Let me go. Masher. Masher. He's dying. Okay,

1012
03:07:44,489 --> 03:07:54,940
put him back in. You good? Hey, settle down there. Now he's gonna listen to me. Hi. Right, I know.

1013
03:07:54,940 --> 03:08:07,559
Finally. Are you hungry? Here it comes. Well, here we go. What comes? Oh, he just pooped out of his

1014
03:08:07,559 --> 03:08:19,590
head. Okay. All right. Good night. Goodbye. Let's just make sure everything's fine. Heat it up to

1015
03:08:19,590 --> 03:08:25,930
about 19.5. Make sure the spray is at 100 and come back. Boil them. No, I'm not doing that.

1016
03:08:28,329 --> 03:08:33,799
I'm not gonna. I'm not going to kill these fish. The stream has been going on for three hours.

1017
03:08:35,750 --> 03:08:42,409
I'm. If you want me to end the whole thing. Would you like to. How are we doing over here? A big plant?

1018
03:08:43,049 --> 03:08:55,319
You have to understand something. This would be. I would waste the entire three hours if I just. Oh,

1019
03:08:55,319 --> 03:08:59,159
let me turn it up as much as it goes and we'll get to see them turn on their side and go up.

1020
03:09:01,219 --> 03:09:12,659
No. Would you like to save and end the session? He's supposed to ask multiple questions. Yeah,

1021
03:09:12,659 --> 03:09:22,489
he's I think he just doesn't like me. Easy. Here we go. Fast forward a day. You can play

1022
03:09:22,489 --> 03:09:27,530
Seaman 2 after this. I can't. Unless I have a Japanese console. Because that is a Japanese

1023
03:09:27,530 --> 03:09:39,299
only game. It never came out in the West. So it's now going to be the 18th of March.

1024
03:09:39,940 --> 03:09:52,540
Yeah, there is a two for some reason. It is 317 at 154. Let's go ahead and make it.

1025
03:09:53,819 --> 03:10:05,739
318 at 54. So at 1254. We had five community subjects coming right now. Five community

1026
03:10:05,739 --> 03:10:13,459
subs from Harmony Accord. Thank you. Five spot. Congratulations to those who got the five

1027
03:10:13,459 --> 03:10:23,219
community subs. And again, thanks for the fucking subs. 318 2019. We've been playing this game for

1028
03:10:24,579 --> 03:10:29,139
eight days at this point. After school, we come home off the bus and we sprint home

1029
03:10:29,860 --> 03:10:50,379
for eight straight days. After school at one in the morning. Yeah. You stayed at

1030
03:10:50,379 --> 03:10:57,530
the extracurricular activity. I don't know. You might be in like the drama club. Maybe you're

1031
03:10:57,530 --> 03:11:09,500
doing shop. You're in the math club. All you said to him when he was a baby was English and pizza.

1032
03:11:10,059 --> 03:11:17,940
No wonder he hates you. Anonymous Gifter just gave five community subs. Good evening. Thank you,

1033
03:11:17,940 --> 03:11:27,079
whoever it was. Welcome to the laboratory of Jean Paul Gasset. Greetings and welcome back.

1034
03:11:27,879 --> 03:11:35,909
You're doing a good job. First, a recap of your previous visit. I seem so dedicated. The eggs in

1035
03:11:35,909 --> 03:11:41,190
the insect cage have hatched into larvae. It is important to raise them carefully.

1036
03:11:42,149 --> 03:11:48,069
If you put too many larvae into the tank, you may find yourself running out of food for seaman later.

1037
03:11:49,639 --> 03:11:54,920
But if you manage the larva well, you should have no problem keeping seaman well fed.

1038
03:12:00,120 --> 03:12:11,139
At the moment, the habitat contains two human. They appear to be very hungry. So let us head

1039
03:12:11,139 --> 03:12:25,059
over to the tank. Here we go. Do not remove the memory card during gameplay. Fucking kid. Don't

1040
03:12:25,059 --> 03:12:32,739
remove it. I had four before. Yeah. When they were babies and then they started eating each other.

1041
03:12:37,379 --> 03:12:48,840
It's cold in here. Sweet oxygen. Feed me right now. Five more community subs.

1042
03:12:49,639 --> 03:12:55,459
Potter fan. Oh, it's 15 in a row here. Thank you so much, Potter fan. Thanks a lot, guys.

1043
03:13:04,600 --> 03:13:05,079
Those are going.

1044
03:13:07,100 --> 03:13:26,790
Heat it up. Turn the light on. Hey, food here now. Hey, player, drop some chips in here.

1045
03:13:27,750 --> 03:13:37,430
Let's take a look. Give me something to eat. Just relax. I'm starving. Let's stop at 18.2. There we

1046
03:13:37,430 --> 03:13:45,670
go. Now we should be good at 18.9. That should get you 19.5, 19.6, 19.7, 19.7, 19.8. 19. All right,

1047
03:13:45,670 --> 03:13:54,090
here we go. Here's a plant. So we've got how many larvae in here? Maybe I shouldn't even use one.

1048
03:13:55,209 --> 03:14:01,850
Maybe I should just drop the pellets in. Another five community subs from Magellan. Another five.

1049
03:14:02,569 --> 03:14:11,590
Thank you. More 20 community subs now. More like 30 because Bebraham just came in with 10.

1050
03:14:12,889 --> 03:14:20,649
Thank you to all of you. And now here comes another five from Scrumpledungus. Thank you for five.

1051
03:14:20,649 --> 03:14:32,180
Thank you, Bebraham, for 10. The subs just rolled in hard here. Thank you. Thank you for like the

1052
03:14:32,180 --> 03:14:46,200
40 community subs right now. More than that. Jesus, thank you. That's a lot of subs. Missed me. I

1053
03:14:46,200 --> 03:14:52,180
didn't get one. Remember when I was, I was going to give like a thousand community subs, wasn't I?

1054
03:14:52,180 --> 03:14:59,879
If I fucked up that, oh my God. Amscoots. Would you like to save and end the session? Amscoots

1055
03:14:59,879 --> 03:15:08,780
gave 20 essentially. Oh my God. What started this? 20 from Amscoots, which is a huge amount. And then

1056
03:15:08,780 --> 03:15:17,350
La Cranda gave 10. I gave like 500. No, I didn't give 500. It was almost going to be like 500 or

1057
03:15:17,350 --> 03:15:26,020
something. I was doubling nothing over and over again. Thank you everybody. 20 from Amscoots,

1058
03:15:26,020 --> 03:15:48,010
10 from La Cranda. Holy shit. Thank you. Much love to you all. Let's feed the fish. So as long as I

1059
03:15:48,010 --> 03:15:59,780
leave one of these in here, right, then I'll be fine. I want to make sure that that's very well.

1060
03:16:00,100 --> 03:16:09,190
Like, no, I need more in there. More. Oh, no, no, you're talking about the subs. Spergiltron.

1061
03:16:09,190 --> 03:16:23,989
Spergiltron, thank you for the five community subs. Must have food. Another five. Now. Oh,

1062
03:16:23,989 --> 03:16:29,879
yummy, bitty goodness. How do any of the people in this chat know how to play this game?

1063
03:16:30,600 --> 03:16:34,600
That's a really good question. A wiki. People have the wiki open maybe. I wouldn't be surprised.

1064
03:16:34,600 --> 03:16:46,920
Another five community subs. Exifer. Hello. Thank you, Exifer, for the five community subs.

1065
03:16:46,920 --> 03:17:01,530
Is anyone out there? I'm right here. I'm right here. Hello. Hi there. Let's talk. Hey, Greg.

1066
03:17:02,329 --> 03:17:17,819
You have a bloody nose. Greg, let's talk. No. What's up? I was wondering, are you married?

1067
03:17:18,780 --> 03:17:30,760
No. You're unmarried? Yes. Really? Hey, that's okay. Don't listen to people who say you need to

1068
03:17:30,760 --> 03:17:39,479
get married. It's an antiquated notion, really. What a smart fish. You want to be to lower the

1069
03:17:39,479 --> 03:17:43,479
oxygen to make his brain IQ have a problem? No. Moo means moo, by the way. Moo, thanks for the

1070
03:17:43,479 --> 03:17:49,559
five community subs. All right, so you don't have to get married for what? You're not gonna get

1071
03:17:49,639 --> 03:18:04,549
married? Let's talk about politics. What are all your political positions? You know it.

1072
03:18:12,889 --> 03:18:32,579
Politics. Politics. This better be good. I will name you. Yes. I will name you. Do you want a name?

1073
03:18:35,079 --> 03:18:40,680
Okay, I'm going to let you give me a name. Finally. When you've decided what you want to call me,

1074
03:18:41,319 --> 03:18:49,500
I'm ready. I'm ready. All right, then. Here's how to do it. You're going to say my new name

1075
03:18:49,500 --> 03:19:05,479
three times. Each time I say now, say the name once. Got it? Got it. Now. Garfield. One more time.

1076
03:19:06,600 --> 03:19:16,549
Garfield. One more time. Garfield. Okay, I'll remember that. Next time you want to call me,

1077
03:19:16,549 --> 03:19:23,430
using that name. And don't forget the name you gave me. Because if you do, I'm not going to

1078
03:19:23,430 --> 03:19:30,069
tell you what it is. And there it is. Would you like to save and end the session? I gotta go like

1079
03:19:30,069 --> 03:22:04,440
wash my mouth. This is like a used microphone. I just put it in my mouth like deep. I don't

1080
03:22:04,440 --> 03:22:09,559
fuck around with that shit, guys. Somebody could have shoved that up their ass. You know what I

1081
03:22:09,559 --> 03:22:19,860
mean? Can I reliably say that somebody didn't shove this up their ass? I don't know. I'd like

1082
03:22:19,860 --> 03:22:32,940
to say no. It's absolutely not. But can you be sure? I don't know people are fucking crazy. I

1083
03:22:32,940 --> 03:22:43,020
don't know. I have to go see a doctor now? No, I just like rinsed my mouth with like toothpaste

1084
03:22:44,090 --> 03:22:49,530
and water. I took like I squeezed some toothpaste on my finger and like mushed it into my mouth

1085
03:22:49,530 --> 03:22:55,930
and like smeared it all around my teeth and like chewed it up and then like swished around and then

1086
03:22:55,930 --> 03:23:06,760
spit it out. On second thought, why didn't I just use a toothbrush? All right, sea man, let's go.

1087
03:23:07,399 --> 03:23:24,069
So this is Garfield. Hey Garfield. I'm not ignoring you. I'm thinking. I put another mic in my mouth.

1088
03:23:24,069 --> 03:23:31,909
That wasn't a used microphone. Tell me something. Do you like girls? Yes. Then do you have a girlfriend?

1089
03:23:33,559 --> 03:23:52,229
Yes. You do have a girlfriend? Yes. I'm not surprised you stood. Okay. Okay. Anything else?

1090
03:23:55,819 --> 03:24:03,350
What? See, he likes me. He thinks I'm cool.

1091
03:24:05,989 --> 03:24:10,149
This is the dumb one. No, it's not. This is the golden one. The golden one's the smart one.

1092
03:24:10,149 --> 03:24:27,780
This is Greg. Oh, fuck. Wait, now they're both golden. Greg. Hey, Greg. I'm thinking. What's

1093
03:24:27,780 --> 03:24:38,659
going on, Greg? What's new? He called. Yeah, he did call me a virgin like 30 minutes ago. He did.

1094
03:24:40,409 --> 03:24:55,129
Yes. Let's talk. Since you have a girlfriend, let me ask you. Are you two living together? Yes.

1095
03:24:56,459 --> 03:25:06,309
Really? You live with your girlfriend? Yes. Hey, good for you. Just remember, she's not your mom.

1096
03:25:06,950 --> 03:25:09,989
It's not her job to clean up your messes when you're a slob.

1097
03:25:13,190 --> 03:25:22,659
You don't think I know that? I know. What? So what month is your sweetie's birthday in?

1098
03:25:25,530 --> 03:25:35,420
April. April? Yes. An April fool, huh? Feel free to use that joke if you'd like.

1099
03:25:35,420 --> 03:25:54,940
The fuck did you say? Throw a fucking drink at him. That would be a very gross overreaction,

1100
03:25:54,940 --> 03:26:04,459
by the way. Oh, April, huh? But she's an April fool. Then she, shut the fuck up. You'd be like,

1101
03:26:04,459 --> 03:26:19,260
whoa, dude, you gotta calm down. So. Word. Word. So what day is your honey's birthday on?

1102
03:26:25,139 --> 03:26:34,229
Nine. The ninth? Yes. That's so sweet that you remember. I actually don't. I don't know.

1103
03:26:40,659 --> 03:26:43,989
Of course I know what my fucking girlfriend's birthday is, guys.

1104
03:26:45,129 --> 03:27:01,540
I'm doing it for the fish. I'm fucking with the fish. So, anything else? Word. Word. Word. Shut up.

1105
03:27:02,659 --> 03:27:08,860
You shut up. No problem. I'm just kidding, talk to me more. This is the whole video game,

1106
03:27:08,860 --> 03:27:28,379
I need to talk to you. Let's talk. Hey. Hey yourself. Let's talk. Let's talk. Well,

1107
03:27:28,459 --> 03:27:40,139
you're not just going to shit the bed, are we good? How are we doing? I think we're good.

1108
03:27:42,329 --> 03:27:55,260
Let's talk. I'm mad at you. I think I can. I think I can. Don't be mad. Don't be mad.

1109
03:28:03,270 --> 03:28:08,739
Don't make me laugh. You can't be mad. A pee if you don't stop.

1110
03:28:10,979 --> 03:28:16,979
Quit it. Quit it. It hurts. Are we cool? Garfield, are we cool?

1111
03:28:18,549 --> 03:28:31,180
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Get some rest then. Let's talk. So I figured a couple things out,

1112
03:28:31,180 --> 03:28:38,299
matchmaker that I am. Your self-being a Virgo and your partner an Ares, no doubt the beginning of

1113
03:28:38,299 --> 03:28:43,420
your relationship was rather tough as you took time to learn where each person was coming from.

1114
03:28:44,379 --> 03:28:50,620
Ares tend to rush into things, whereas your Virgo personality will spend more time planning.

1115
03:28:51,260 --> 03:28:55,579
Don't be discouraged though, as there are many things you can learn from one another.

1116
03:28:56,459 --> 03:29:03,020
For example, you can teach your Ares patience and your sweetheart can help you cut loose a bit.

1117
03:29:03,739 --> 03:29:10,059
Live a little on the spontaneous edge. Just be aware that your Ares friend may be rather sensitive

1118
03:29:10,059 --> 03:29:17,659
of your criticisms at times and the two of you should be fine. So there, that'll be five dollars.

1119
03:29:17,659 --> 03:29:28,680
That was just vague enough to be real and just real enough for me to care.

1120
03:29:30,120 --> 03:29:56,329
Here's your five dollars. You hungry? No thanks. Let's talk. So listen,

1121
03:29:57,209 --> 03:30:06,969
do you have any kids? Yes, seven. No. So you don't have any kids right now, is that correct?

1122
03:30:07,930 --> 03:30:16,489
No. No. Wait. No. Wait. Wait. He didn't leave. He fucking daffy ducked me. He did like the Looney Tunes thing. No.

1123
03:30:22,489 --> 03:30:29,620
Yes. He daffy ducked me. He fucking like duck season, rabbit season, duck season, rabbit season.

1124
03:30:29,620 --> 03:30:33,540
I got rabbits. I don't even know what the fuck he said. Kids in the future? No.

1125
03:30:38,500 --> 03:30:49,540
I don't like how much information they're getting. Thank god there's no internet because this was a

1126
03:30:49,540 --> 03:30:54,180
game now. Everything you ever say to will get uploaded to a fucking data server and then they

1127
03:30:54,180 --> 03:31:05,219
would start selling it. Thank god this shit don't work now. I guess like this is Siri is the closest

1128
03:31:05,219 --> 03:31:09,139
thing. You don't think they're fucking putting that data somewhere in a fridge and keeping it nice and

1129
03:31:09,139 --> 03:31:18,680
cold? I disable Siri, man. I don't want that shit. You think I want Siri? Like Siri's always just

1130
03:31:18,680 --> 03:31:24,860
listening. How many times have you had like a loud ass diarrhea and you want like Siri to hear that

1131
03:31:24,860 --> 03:31:43,340
and get sent to fucking Apple? Are you kidding me? You stream on the internet? Yeah. But I don't,

1132
03:31:43,340 --> 03:31:50,170
I'm not streaming in my bathroom. I'm not like lying in my bed at two o'clock in the morning

1133
03:31:50,170 --> 03:32:02,200
like this on my iPad streaming under like the covers. What? Let's chat. Garfield.

1134
03:32:03,159 --> 03:32:26,170
Hey Garfield. What's up? Let's talk. I don't want to talk. I'm getting ignored. So tell me,

1135
03:32:27,049 --> 03:32:39,780
how is your father's health? See they want this data. He's fine. He's okay then? Yeah. I thought

1136
03:32:39,780 --> 03:32:52,010
you said he was okay. Is he or not? Yes. He's okay then? Yes. Good. I'm glad to hear he's doing well.

1137
03:32:52,010 --> 03:33:00,059
Is that like a idle mafia threat? You're gonna ask for like protection money in a few minutes?

1138
03:33:00,940 --> 03:33:16,440
Or how the bugs? I still, what is this now? This is like a cocoon. Can I talk to this? Hello?

1139
03:33:17,159 --> 03:33:33,299
What is this thing turning into? I got one more of these. Yeah, they have a face. Is that gonna

1140
03:33:33,299 --> 03:33:44,360
turn into a, that's like kind of freaking me out. All right, whatever. Let's heat it up a little bit

1141
03:33:44,360 --> 03:33:58,020
more. Can I tap it? I don't think I want to. Hey Greg. Greg? Okay, just be sure to save some

1142
03:33:58,020 --> 03:34:11,909
for later. Let's talk. Let's talk. Let's talk. Let's talk. Hey.

1143
03:34:19,379 --> 03:34:28,250
Call your dad right now and make sure he's okay. Oh, how's your father? Father's fine.

1144
03:34:28,250 --> 03:34:35,930
Oh, that's good to hear that your father is doing well. And there's like a long violin

1145
03:34:35,930 --> 03:34:48,090
horror sound. That like? I pick up the phone. I drop the phone like three times. I drop it again.

1146
03:34:48,649 --> 03:35:07,879
Dad? Dad? Dad? No answer. Let's talk. Let's talk. Is your father still working?

1147
03:35:08,840 --> 03:35:20,100
No. He's taking it easy, is he? Yes. Well, he's retired. He deserves a rest after all those years

1148
03:35:20,100 --> 03:35:25,379
of supporting your family. Actually, call him. You know, unless he was a deadbeat who never gave you

1149
03:35:25,379 --> 03:35:34,520
a dime. In which case he should be forced to work 80 hours a week hard labor. That's pretty dark.

1150
03:35:35,319 --> 03:35:49,049
Hmm. I'll try you again later. Let's talk. So, what month is your dad's birthday? Jesus, what the

1151
03:35:49,049 --> 03:36:06,600
fuck is with the birthdays? December. Hello. What month was your dad born in? December. He was born

1152
03:36:06,600 --> 03:36:16,149
in December? Yes. Yes. Interesting. The fathers of most people I know were born in December.

1153
03:36:16,149 --> 03:36:32,920
That's weird. Would you like to know the day? What? He knows your dad. So, what day is your dad's

1154
03:36:32,920 --> 03:36:46,200
birthday? 25th. The 25th? No. All right. Let's try that again, mush mouth. On what day was your dad born?

1155
03:36:46,200 --> 03:36:59,590
Mush mouth? 16th. The 16th? Yes. I'll remember that. Your father's birthday is important, you know.

1156
03:37:00,149 --> 03:37:05,350
But if you ask me, the most important thing is that your dad knows how much he means to you.

1157
03:37:06,459 --> 03:37:12,620
Unless you think he's a huge pain in the neck. I'd probably keep that to myself if I were you.

1158
03:37:15,780 --> 03:37:21,780
What are you gonna do to my dad? What are you gonna do to my dad? What are you gonna

1159
03:37:21,780 --> 03:37:29,909
do to my dad? Let me go. I'm just kidding. Maybe you should take a nap.

1160
03:37:37,940 --> 03:37:55,459
Quit it. Quit it. It hurts. Let's talk. Who wants to talk? Any news? Any news? Not much.

1161
03:37:56,420 --> 03:38:17,989
The fish have... What are you talking about? Anyone have any news? Garfield. I'm great. Thanks.

1162
03:38:17,989 --> 03:38:32,219
Let's talk. Let's talk. Is your mother in good health? Yes. She's doing well? Yes. That's certainly

1163
03:38:32,219 --> 03:38:49,659
good to hear. Thank you. Let's talk. When's your mother's birthday? So, tell me. Does your mother

1164
03:38:49,659 --> 03:39:00,020
work? No. She doesn't work. Is that right? No. Well, I bet she works hard enough without an actual

1165
03:39:00,020 --> 03:39:08,200
job. Being a mom is hard work, you know. And giving birth? Ugh. Let me tell you. I'd rather be eaten

1166
03:39:08,200 --> 03:39:14,840
by a shark than go through that. Not that I have any choice in the matter. The age group for this

1167
03:39:14,840 --> 03:39:25,700
game is for probably teens and early 20s. Not for old fucks like me. Let's talk. He wants the birthdays.

1168
03:39:25,700 --> 03:39:29,379
He wants their health reports. He wants the medical records. What month was your mother born?

1169
03:39:31,479 --> 03:39:41,620
August. She was born in August? Yes. My knowledge of you and your family grows ever more complete.

1170
03:39:45,930 --> 03:39:56,819
Let's talk. What day is your mother's birthday on? 20. I'm not familiar with that date. I said 20.

1171
03:39:56,819 --> 03:40:08,299
Do you have your own special calendar? Let's try it again. 20. The 20th? Yes. Of course.

1172
03:40:09,260 --> 03:40:16,299
It's all becoming clear. I think mothers are great. I hope you know how lucky you are to

1173
03:40:16,299 --> 03:40:20,700
have a mom. I'm gonna go downstairs for a break. You wouldn't want to end up like me. Forced to

1174
03:40:20,700 --> 03:40:27,239
depend on complete strangers for food and attention. He's gonna find where I am. He's gonna know my

1175
03:40:27,239 --> 03:40:38,059
mother's information, my father's information. He's gonna be holding a fucking knife. Put down

1176
03:40:38,059 --> 03:40:51,559
the knife. Put down the knife. Let's talk. You done? Is your significant other in the

1177
03:40:51,559 --> 03:41:03,260
room right now? No. Is there anyone else in the room besides you? Technically, yes.

1178
03:41:04,819 --> 03:41:31,000
There's like 6,000 people. Yes. Oh. Never mind. Let's talk. Tomorrow. We'll talk again tomorrow.

1179
03:41:31,000 --> 03:41:38,920
Okay. They've eaten. Let's make sure they're comfortable. What if there wasn't somebody

1180
03:41:38,920 --> 03:41:52,709
else in the room? What would he have said? It's kind of creepy. Actual murderer. I'm in danger.

1181
03:42:00,139 --> 03:42:18,629
We'll never know. 19.5. Looks good. Put the air up. Put the light. Let's go make sure we're sprayed.

1182
03:42:22,459 --> 03:42:27,739
Up at 100. So we have one. Here's the thing though. We have one. I got two pellets.

1183
03:42:30,700 --> 03:42:37,260
I have one bug and then one cocoon. The question is, should I just feed the pellets and let these

1184
03:42:37,979 --> 03:42:46,200
turn into seeds? You know what I'm saying? I'm just gonna use the pellets tomorrow.

1185
03:42:46,200 --> 03:42:51,510
I destroyed that egg. It was not. That was a bonehead move. It really was.

1186
03:42:52,389 --> 03:43:13,909
All right. Let's go. Would you like to... Tomorrow. Fast forward the clock. Now he asks if you're

1187
03:43:13,909 --> 03:43:28,360
like cheating on your girlfriend. I'm telling you. That's why. Shit. I forgot to fucking

1188
03:43:28,360 --> 03:43:43,610
mute the screen. Sorry. We did get a lot of talking though. 19th at just like a day later.

1189
03:43:47,180 --> 03:44:06,809
Close it up. Lots of personal info. Telling me doesn't exist. I'll try that.

1190
03:44:12,409 --> 03:44:22,940
The Dreamcast was really cool. Yeah. It was a very interesting system. Who should we call

1191
03:44:22,940 --> 03:44:34,579
if you were missing tomorrow? I don't know, buddy. They tried shit. Yeah, they did try shit.

1192
03:44:36,500 --> 03:44:43,860
Welcome to the laboratory of Jean Paul Gasset. Let's get some info. Greetings and welcome back.

1193
03:44:44,659 --> 03:44:53,459
You're doing a good job. First, a recap of your previous visit. Do I have any tattoos? No. None.

1194
03:44:56,600 --> 03:45:05,780
At the moment, the habitat contains two gill men. They are suffering from the cold.

1195
03:45:06,420 --> 03:45:12,469
Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level. Would you ever get a

1196
03:45:12,469 --> 03:45:16,870
drunk tattoo? Allow me to give you the highlights for today. Would you ever get a tattoo? No. Not

1197
03:45:16,870 --> 03:45:23,350
anymore. If Professor Gasset's data is accurate, we can expect a change in the gill man's body

1198
03:45:23,350 --> 03:45:28,149
very shortly. A change. So let us head over to the tank. We're gonna get an evolution here, I think.

1199
03:45:29,270 --> 03:45:38,170
Is Seaman gonna be Landman? I told you about the tattoo that I was gonna get when I was like 21.

1200
03:45:39,290 --> 03:45:46,920
I was gonna get the venom symbol right here. The venom. Good thing it didn't go through with that

1201
03:45:46,920 --> 03:46:11,420
one. I thought, I think it would be pretty cool. Remember, I was also like, I was also fit. So that

1202
03:46:11,420 --> 03:46:16,940
would have looked cool, right? Remember, I had like a fucking stacked up body. Somebody's dead. No.

1203
03:46:24,889 --> 03:46:35,020
It's about time. Another day. You want everyone to know that you're going to the bathroom. Yay.

1204
03:46:35,020 --> 03:46:43,299
Well, they do. They know now. Took you long enough. Hey, how about turning up the air in here?

1205
03:46:44,100 --> 03:46:51,590
Let me make sure I didn't go too far. Come on. It's like the wheel on Wheel of Fortune. Stop.

1206
03:46:54,010 --> 03:47:02,979
Thought I was definitely going to suffocate for a minute there. Having the venom symbol on your arm

1207
03:47:02,979 --> 03:47:24,569
would be the equivalent of wearing a monster energy hat. Hey you. Is anyone out there?

1208
03:47:25,209 --> 03:47:36,180
Wear a tap out shirt. Hey. Good evening. Does it evolve? Good evening.

1209
03:47:38,260 --> 03:47:46,420
Let's talk. Do you see any differences? I have another question for you and it's a serious one,

1210
03:47:46,420 --> 03:47:55,930
so no fooling around. Do you like yourself? I'll be honest. Yeah. You do like yourself?

1211
03:47:56,809 --> 03:48:06,309
Yes. Yes. I'll bet you like yourself. In fact, I'd guess you like yourself at least twice a day.

1212
03:48:07,030 --> 03:48:17,110
But seriously, there's nothing wrong with liking yourself. I like you too. Something's going on

1213
03:48:17,110 --> 03:48:30,100
here. Does this imply that, that's no, he's really just totally incorrect. Let's talk. Let's talk.

1214
03:48:34,059 --> 03:48:42,709
So what's the one thing you like most about yourself? Fucking loaded question.

1215
03:48:49,850 --> 03:48:56,969
What do you say? Let me ask this again and this time I'd appreciate an answer.

1216
03:48:57,930 --> 03:49:03,610
Okay. So what's the one thing you like most about yourself?

1217
03:49:04,569 --> 03:49:17,420
My intuition. Let's try that again. What do you like most about yourself and enunciate

1218
03:49:18,379 --> 03:49:31,129
this time? Sense of humor. Sense of humor. You like your looks? Yeah. Well, I like your looks too,

1219
03:49:32,329 --> 03:49:39,290
except for when you give me that one dirty one. What physical feature in particular do you like

1220
03:49:39,290 --> 03:50:03,670
the best? My teeth. Hey, why all the noise? My chin. My chin. Chin. Are you trying to break my

1221
03:50:05,129 --> 03:50:16,260
thing that allows me to hear? Come on, stay with me here. I said, so what's the one thing you like

1222
03:50:16,260 --> 03:50:27,690
most about yourself? Chin. Your chin? Yes. I have to say I've never noticed anyone with a particularly

1223
03:50:27,690 --> 03:50:48,620
exquisite chin before. Well, I mean, that is until now, of course. Where, what are we doing? Yes.

1224
03:50:49,940 --> 03:51:00,700
It'll cost you a buck. Let's talk. I know you said you like yourself and that's great,

1225
03:51:00,700 --> 03:51:08,219
but I mean, you're not perfect. Nobody is except maybe me. What's my biggest flaw? There's got to

1226
03:51:08,219 --> 03:51:15,739
be something you don't like about yourself. So if you had to pick the one thing that you dislike

1227
03:51:15,739 --> 03:51:32,549
most about yourself, what would it be? Hey, when somebody asks you a question, you answer it.

1228
03:51:33,430 --> 03:51:41,829
So are you up to answering my question now? What I wanted to know was, I know you said you like

1229
03:51:41,829 --> 03:51:51,190
yourself and that's great, but I mean, you're not perfect. Nobody is except maybe me. There's got to

1230
03:51:51,190 --> 03:51:58,709
be something you don't like about yourself. So if you had to pick the one thing that you dislike

1231
03:51:58,709 --> 03:52:10,780
most about yourself, what would it be? Your height? Well, as long as your body's long enough

1232
03:52:10,780 --> 03:52:37,829
to reach the floor, you should be fine. Let's talk. Let's talk. Let's talk. So it's interesting

1233
03:52:37,829 --> 03:52:43,430
that when I asked you what you liked best about yourself, you picked a physical feature. I mean,

1234
03:52:43,430 --> 03:52:49,829
you could have said personality or intelligence or a variety of other emotional or intellectual

1235
03:52:49,829 --> 03:52:56,629
attributes. Fake words. So in general, do you think that you are attractive? Oh my god, this is

1236
03:52:56,629 --> 03:53:05,000
like fucking with me here. I don't know. Sometimes maybe. Yes. You do. Sometimes I look in the mirror

1237
03:53:05,000 --> 03:53:08,760
and I look like shit and I hate it. Sometimes I look in the mirror and I go, I think I look all

1238
03:53:08,760 --> 03:53:16,520
right. Yes. That's good. Usually if you believe that you are attractive, other people will think

1239
03:53:16,600 --> 03:53:21,799
so too. What do you guys think? Because at the very least, they will be attracted to your

1240
03:53:21,799 --> 03:53:39,899
self-confidence. Okay, what do you guys think? People are gonna screenshot that and I look like

1241
03:53:41,670 --> 03:53:55,020
fucking crazed. Let's talk. So you think you're at least somewhat attractive. Well, do you think

1242
03:53:55,100 --> 03:54:12,340
other people find you attractive? Do you guys think I'm attractive? What? What? I can't hear you.

1243
03:54:13,059 --> 03:54:20,340
You know, let us revisit my last inquiry to you. That is, if you can cooperate this time.

1244
03:54:21,940 --> 03:54:29,860
So you think you're at least somewhat attractive. Well, do you think other people find you attractive?

1245
03:54:30,579 --> 03:54:42,379
Yes. So you do think people find you attractive? Yes. It's great that you think so highly of yourself.

1246
03:54:43,020 --> 03:54:49,020
Just be careful that your head doesn't get too big. Otherwise you'll never be able to buy a hat

1247
03:54:49,020 --> 03:55:01,770
again. I have a small head. Anything else? Let's talk. There's nothing I want to talk about right now.

1248
03:55:02,649 --> 03:55:13,100
What do you think of yourself? No, leave me alone. What is your best trait?

1249
03:55:15,020 --> 03:55:24,860
What? So not too long ago, I asked you if you liked yourself. Now I have a slightly different

1250
03:55:24,860 --> 03:55:34,969
question for you. Do you think other people like you? Yes. You do think people like you?

1251
03:55:35,930 --> 03:55:42,489
Yes. Well, that's good. You like yourself and you think other people like you.

1252
03:55:43,049 --> 03:55:45,850
That sounds pretty healthy. How are you going to turn this around on me?

1253
03:55:46,489 --> 03:56:01,139
You don't exist. You don't exist. How's that for a brain buster? Put this tongue in that mouth.

1254
03:56:01,860 --> 03:56:15,559
Dream on. You are a video game. Right, I know. You're not real. What do you want?

1255
03:56:15,559 --> 03:56:29,000
You aren't real. You are not real. Right, I know. You are operating on the Sega Dreamcast.

1256
03:56:32,840 --> 03:56:44,700
Everything is fine. Let's talk. We've been talking a lot about how you see yourself and how

1257
03:56:44,700 --> 03:56:52,860
other people see you. Now let me ask you this. Have you ever seen yourself on TV or on video?

1258
03:56:53,819 --> 03:57:02,659
Yes. So I guess you know then that the rumor about the camera adding 10 pounds isn't true.

1259
03:57:03,219 --> 03:57:11,540
It adds at least 20 and a couple of unsightly fins. It can be weird seeing yourself on video.

1260
03:57:12,260 --> 03:57:21,590
Were you surprised by the way you looked? No. Well then I guess you are just very comfortable

1261
03:57:21,670 --> 03:57:28,950
with seeing your naked body in all those positions. Oh wait, maybe you haven't seen that video yet.

1262
03:57:30,389 --> 03:57:41,430
You got tapes of me naked? Is that what he's trying to say?

1263
03:57:46,549 --> 03:57:59,370
You're going to jail. What do you want? You are going to jail. You're going to jail.

1264
03:58:01,299 --> 03:58:10,950
What do you want? You are going to jail. Let's talk. So you said you liked yourself. What is

1265
03:58:10,950 --> 03:58:15,590
with this whole self thing? You think other people like you. You think you're attractive

1266
03:58:15,590 --> 03:58:19,110
and you think other people find you attractive. All right well when you put it like that I sound

1267
03:58:19,110 --> 03:58:23,590
like a fucking narcissist. I'd say it seems like you have a lot of self-confidence and a positive

1268
03:58:23,590 --> 03:58:33,030
self-image. Would you agree? Sometimes, yeah. That's great but don't get too big of a head.

1269
03:58:33,030 --> 03:58:39,430
Otherwise. It'll make your body look funny. Hold on I gotta like take care of the other animals.

1270
03:58:39,510 --> 03:58:58,729
What the fuck is that thing? What do we do with the moth? Can I talk to the moth? Hello? Hello?

1271
03:58:59,450 --> 03:59:13,510
I hate this thing. I hate this thing. Hello? I can't even fucking. No I don't want to look

1272
03:59:13,510 --> 03:59:26,280
at this. This thing's fucking freaking me out. Another moth coming up. Smash it. Kill it. I'm

1273
03:59:26,280 --> 03:59:35,260
not going to kill it. Feed it. Do you have to feed this thing pellets? No, no. This thing.

1274
03:59:36,219 --> 03:59:44,979
No you don't have to feed that thing. Just make sure the spray is there and I'm going to feed

1275
03:59:44,979 --> 04:00:11,370
the pellets to these two. Oh yummy baity goodness. Can we eat claymation, streamer? I think that's all

1276
04:00:11,370 --> 04:00:18,649
that they're going to get for today. Tasty. Although you need food too. You also need to eat.

1277
04:00:19,530 --> 04:00:24,709
I'm out of food though. This is kind of the last bit of food I have for the two of them.

1278
04:00:24,790 --> 04:00:43,350
Can just one of them die? Hey thanks. How are you today? What? Tasty. Are you human?

1279
04:00:45,299 --> 04:01:02,540
What's the meaning of life? Eh? What's the point? As if you care. Give me the secret. Since I don't

1280
04:01:02,540 --> 04:01:10,139
have anything else to add, I'll be going now. Goodbye. Are you going to get legs or something

1281
04:01:10,139 --> 04:01:18,870
here soon? This might be ugly. You may want to look away. No let's zoom the fuck in. Evolve? No

1282
04:01:18,870 --> 04:01:30,219
let's just poo. Look at those little legs. See the little legs on the side? Someone talk to me.

1283
04:01:32,790 --> 04:01:50,950
What's up? Do you think you're attractive? What? Do you think I'm attractive?

1284
04:01:52,760 --> 04:02:05,459
Do you think I'm good looking? Hello? Am I attractive? Let's talk. No not today. Maybe tomorrow.

1285
04:02:07,270 --> 04:02:19,909
Skip ahead a few hours? Will you evolve? You're not so bad looking yourself. Thank you. Finally

1286
04:02:19,909 --> 04:02:38,149
I got the answer I was looking for. What are your fears? Are you afraid of anything? Amazing.

1287
04:02:39,030 --> 04:02:57,930
Well yes I guess so. Are you afraid? What do you fear most? Is this better? Goodbye. Have a good

1288
04:02:57,930 --> 04:03:07,000
night. Good night. Uh I think I'm gonna skip an hour or two. What time is it right now in the game?

1289
04:03:07,959 --> 04:03:12,250
Would you like to save and end the session? To skip till tomorrow?

1290
04:03:13,049 --> 04:03:35,879
To skip a day? Only go an hour or two. Yeah I'll go a day. Like not a full day.

1291
04:03:36,600 --> 04:04:07,079
I love cheating in old video games. So 319 at 47. We're gonna do 319 at like three four hours later?

1292
04:04:07,079 --> 04:04:21,829
Like maybe three hours? Two hours? I'm gonna say two hours. Not a whole day. Three hours.

1293
04:04:23,559 --> 04:04:33,579
Is your father working? I already gave you that answer. 12. 12. 12. You know a lot of 12s.

1294
04:04:34,139 --> 04:05:00,250
Let's just go there. We'll go there. Like 8, 10. Let's see what we got. Oh yeah. Blood type. I don't

1295
04:05:00,250 --> 04:05:17,500
even know what my blood type is. That was some weird like video game physics engine bullshit.

1296
04:05:21,860 --> 04:05:24,819
I just picked it up. I didn't do it. There's nothing in there. I don't know why I keep trying

1297
04:05:24,819 --> 04:05:42,549
to sip out of it. Here we go. This is your second visit today. It is good to have you back so soon.

1298
04:05:43,190 --> 04:05:53,530
Let's see. Last time did you notice the Gill man has begun to sprout legs? I did see the little

1299
04:05:53,530 --> 04:06:00,569
one. Preparing for the next step in his evolution. Land. However this tank holds only water at the

1300
04:06:00,569 --> 04:06:08,540
moment. Changes must be made to facilitate their new appendages. Also with the addition of legs,

1301
04:06:09,180 --> 04:06:15,819
this creature can no longer be referred to as Gill man. Rather he'll be referred to as podfish

1302
04:06:15,819 --> 04:06:23,860
from this point forward. Podfish. Did you see the moth emerge from the cocoon? I did. It is quite

1303
04:06:23,860 --> 04:06:34,700
amazing. If you missed it, watch your next pupa carefully. Vodfish. At the moment the habitat

1304
04:06:34,700 --> 04:06:44,780
contains two podfish. They are suffering from the cold. Please use the heater to raise the

1305
04:06:44,780 --> 04:06:54,340
temperature to a more comfortable level. So let us head over to the tank. Let's see how these

1306
04:06:54,340 --> 04:07:16,569
podfish are doing. Don't break that. You're gonna need it. So I'll be honest, I've never seen or

1307
04:07:16,569 --> 04:07:24,170
heard anything about this game other than the fish. I owned this game when I was a teenager

1308
04:07:24,170 --> 04:07:28,409
and I think I told you I got maybe 10 minutes in and said hello and then turned it off because I

1309
04:07:28,409 --> 04:07:34,569
didn't get it. I don't even know what possibly could happen. They actually have legs now.

1310
04:07:34,569 --> 04:08:01,590
That's scary. Oh goody. Yay. That's weird. That is very odd. Yeah that's weird. Let's take a look

1311
04:08:01,590 --> 04:08:23,379
over here. Uh oh. Where's the food? I don't have any food. There's an egg here. I see one egg. I

1312
04:08:23,379 --> 04:08:41,780
don't see any. Are they gonna die? Because right now this, I have maybe, it says two days and they

1313
04:08:41,780 --> 04:08:52,059
die right? The moth is food. I don't think I should do that yet. I'm gonna wait till tomorrow.

1314
04:08:53,129 --> 04:09:02,180
It's still the same day technically so they're good. You know I could really eat. Fuck. Hey.

1315
04:09:03,739 --> 04:09:20,790
Leave me alone. Let's talk. I like your new legs. What are you doing? Cool legs. Nice new legs.

1316
04:09:21,670 --> 04:09:38,840
I like the legs. Let's talk. Let's talk. Yes. You loading up on an answer? Let's talk. He's pissed.

1317
04:09:39,399 --> 04:09:49,979
What's the matter? I'm a little hungry. We're gonna have to fast forward today. They're not gonna be

1318
04:09:49,979 --> 04:09:58,889
dead right? Let's talk. Let's talk. There's nothing I want to talk about right now.

1319
04:09:59,049 --> 04:10:10,579
Now let's have a conversation. Don't repeat. It makes them mad. Well look here.

1320
04:10:11,379 --> 04:10:15,940
The reason why I'm repeating it is because see the little thing in the middle? When you hold a down

1321
04:10:16,739 --> 04:10:20,819
and you say something, that will change to tell you if they even heard it or not.

1322
04:10:21,540 --> 04:10:28,340
So when I talk, let's say I go let's talk and it doesn't change. I'm only waiting for it to change

1323
04:10:28,420 --> 04:10:36,520
and then someone over here wants to eat. All right I'm gonna have to go one day.

1324
04:10:37,879 --> 04:11:02,420
Is it chow time yet? Let's wait a few hours. Add land. How am I supposed to add land?

1325
04:11:05,879 --> 04:11:09,719
Oh I was looking at chat. We're fine. It's a little hoppy. That'll be fine.

1326
04:11:11,750 --> 04:11:22,549
I have no way to add land. All right this one's about to come out. All right I got two moths now

1327
04:11:22,549 --> 04:11:26,709
which means there's an egg here. I don't want to kill one of the moths because that's how that's

1328
04:11:26,709 --> 04:11:39,670
how they produce eggs. I'm gonna have to fast forward like three or four hours. I think I need

1329
04:11:39,670 --> 04:12:02,379
some food. Shit. I will feed you later. We're gonna fast forward. Let's go. Would you like to save and

1330
04:12:02,379 --> 04:12:15,340
end the session? We're gonna go like six more hours. Ask them for food. No land happens

1331
04:12:15,340 --> 04:12:27,770
automatically. I can't add it. Get some food. It'll cost you a buck. Produce food. No no we

1332
04:12:27,770 --> 04:12:36,709
gotta fast forward. Would you like to save? We're gonna go like six hours, seven hours ahead

1333
04:12:37,430 --> 04:12:56,760
because then it'll be one day. I hope they're not dead. Oh fuck. What do you think like 10 hours?

1334
04:12:59,270 --> 04:13:13,500
I'm saying probably six to ten. Why is a blue screen such a big deal? Because it's very bright

1335
04:13:13,500 --> 04:13:16,780
and if people have a full screen it's like incredibly jarring because I have a full screen

1336
04:13:16,780 --> 04:13:35,930
here and it hurts. I'll go four hours ahead see what happens. This is your third day coming back.

1337
04:13:35,930 --> 04:13:57,909
You are addicted. Please feed us. Why did Leonard Nimoy do this game? Who published it?

1338
04:13:58,790 --> 04:14:05,209
Um I think this was this was like a launch game for Sega Dreamcast wasn't it? This is no this is

1339
04:14:05,209 --> 04:14:28,680
a Sega game. This is produced and developed by Sega. It's like a first party title I think. I

1340
04:14:28,680 --> 04:14:47,079
should change it by like 10 minutes and come back like 15 times. Good. Good. Still alive.

1341
04:14:53,129 --> 04:15:09,850
Can I just get rid of one of the sea men? Screen show. Oh fuck. He said that I need to feed them

1342
04:15:09,850 --> 04:15:17,479
immediately. I'm sorry. I want to get rid of one of them. Like that's just too much to feed two.

1343
04:15:21,719 --> 04:15:26,600
He said that their legs are developed and they're hungry and to feed them immediately.

1344
04:15:32,229 --> 04:15:42,069
Damn it. I'm gonna have to right? Is it a larva? No it's just two of those eggs.

1345
04:15:42,069 --> 04:15:51,049
How long does it take for an egg to hatch? How long does it take for a little larva egg to hatch?

1346
04:15:53,420 --> 04:16:01,860
An hour? Should I just go back and do it an hour? Feed the moth? I there you don't feed the moths.

1347
04:16:02,870 --> 04:16:08,139
You can feed the moth now? Feed them what? Feed the moth? Well I don't have any food.

1348
04:16:09,020 --> 04:16:18,569
Oh feed you mean talk about feed them one of these moths because here's an egg that'll hatch

1349
04:16:19,690 --> 04:16:31,420
and then I got two of these. Is this a bad idea? I don't know if this is a good idea.

1350
04:16:32,139 --> 04:16:36,969
This is what's it despite there's a spider in here. What the fuck is this spider? What do I do

1351
04:16:36,969 --> 04:16:49,299
about the spider? What's a spider? What is the spider? I can I can eat this one. Kill it. I can't

1352
04:16:49,299 --> 04:17:06,680
kill it. I don't need to kill the moth now. Spider is food. Oh can I? Is it poisonous? It's a poisonous

1353
04:17:06,680 --> 04:17:22,940
spider. I have a larva though right now. We're good. I don't need to kill. Should I throw this away?

1354
04:17:23,739 --> 04:17:50,870
Flick the spider. Flick spider. I'm trying. I can't flick the spider. Spider eats the bugs. Flicker.

1355
04:17:50,870 --> 04:18:13,940
I... Would you like to save and end the session? I'll do it. No one's ever written anything about

1356
04:18:13,940 --> 04:18:25,399
this. Ctrl-F spider. Also note that all living things in the insect cage can be picked up and

1357
04:18:25,399 --> 04:18:30,680
either fed to the semen in your tank or stored in the storage matrix. I often find it useful

1358
04:18:30,680 --> 04:18:34,600
to keep a larva or two in the storage matrix in case you're having trouble getting moths to lay

1359
04:18:34,600 --> 04:18:42,120
eggs in the cage. Often because they are being killed by a spider. Speaking of which, occasionally

1360
04:18:42,120 --> 04:18:47,719
a kimoth egg will hatch into a spider. Although this seems highly unlikely, it does happen. So

1361
04:18:47,719 --> 04:18:53,879
we got a rare spawn here. If you feed a spider to you semen it will become sick. When this happens

1362
04:18:53,879 --> 04:19:00,360
you must spend a couple of days saying kind things to the sick semen. Like get well soon or I love

1363
04:19:00,360 --> 04:19:06,920
you. Cheesy I know, but it's better than having your semen die. Okay. Another annoying thing about

1364
04:19:06,920 --> 04:19:12,280
spiders is that if they are left in the cage long enough they will spin a web that your kimoths can

1365
04:19:12,280 --> 04:19:17,399
get caught in. If a kimoth is caught in the web it cannot escape unless you grab it and then drop

1366
04:19:17,399 --> 04:19:23,079
it back in the cage. The spider will kill it if it's in the web long enough. Since you cannot store

1367
04:19:23,079 --> 04:19:27,639
spiders in the storage matrix, the only way to get rid of them is to drop them in with your semen

1368
04:19:28,200 --> 04:19:32,680
after you've fed your semen. By the way we have to get the rare fucking spawn.

1369
04:19:33,979 --> 04:19:38,620
Since semen always ignore any food dropped in its cage after it has eaten they will not eat the

1370
04:19:38,620 --> 04:19:45,579
spider. The spider is also harmless to your semen and you should not worry about it being with them

1371
04:19:45,579 --> 04:20:03,620
as long as they have already eaten. Okay. So feed them the larva, feed Greg the real food,

1372
04:20:03,620 --> 04:20:11,190
and then feed Garfield the spider. That was a really fucked up strange laugh and I even saw

1373
04:20:11,190 --> 04:20:35,459
on the preview how fucking weird I looked. Okay here we go. Pick it up. Dude pick up the fucking

1374
04:20:35,459 --> 04:20:57,290
larva. Okay here we go. Which one of them is Garfield? I don't know. Whoever gets it first

1375
04:20:57,290 --> 04:21:04,889
lives. Oh good. You get to live. I don't even know who you are. Fucking he got it. God damn it. All

1376
04:21:04,889 --> 04:21:17,290
right now they've both eaten. Where's the spider? God this thing's terrifying. They've both eaten.

1377
04:21:19,559 --> 04:21:25,239
So now I can drop this in here and they won't eat it. That's what the game facts from like 1998

1378
04:21:25,239 --> 04:21:41,180
said. Don't eat that. Why are you doing this? Don't eat that. You just ate. Okay was this going to

1379
04:21:41,180 --> 04:21:54,250
drown? Don't eat it. Don't eat it. All right everything's good. I still have the two moths.

1380
04:21:54,889 --> 04:22:04,309
Perfect. Now they've both eaten and we're good to go. We're still surviving. Good. Now I have a

1381
04:22:04,309 --> 04:22:09,899
question. Does the spider stay in the tank forever until somebody eats it or will it just drown?

1382
04:22:14,500 --> 04:22:39,959
I don't see it. Hello. Get arms. Hi. Hey Greg. Greg. Greg. Hello. Come on let me talk to him.

1383
04:22:42,459 --> 04:22:54,760
Greg. The fuck are you doing? Hello. Garfield. I'm not even getting an indicator that they're

1384
04:22:54,760 --> 04:23:12,440
hearing me. Greg. Hello. Hello. Hello. No they're not even paying attention. Snap out of it. Let's

1385
04:23:12,440 --> 04:23:19,719
go. We have conversations to have. Let the mating begin. What do you mean let the mating begin?

1386
04:23:20,760 --> 04:23:28,389
You're not gonna like do two brothers and there's not they're not doing this right? Hey this isn't

1387
04:23:28,389 --> 04:24:09,899
the spice channel. Turn around. Why is this happening? Why would you have? How long are you guys

1388
04:24:09,899 --> 04:24:33,659
gonna do it for? I okay. Who's your daddy? Why is he dead? He fucked to death. What? He had sex to a

1389
04:24:33,659 --> 04:24:53,219
point where he died. He had a heart attack during sex. Okay. That's unbelievable. One of them had a

1390
04:24:53,219 --> 04:25:21,579
heart attack and died. So is. Hello. Hello. Just unresponsive. Let's talk. Let's talk. Talk to me.

1391
04:25:22,540 --> 04:25:29,819
So tell me do you own a computer? That's the first question. Yes. First question. So you

1392
04:25:29,819 --> 04:25:38,729
own a computer right? Yes. You have a computer and yet you'd rather sit here and talk to me.

1393
04:25:39,610 --> 04:25:52,170
Well that's touching. No really it is. Do you have a password? What is the password?

1394
04:25:52,889 --> 04:26:03,350
Let's talk. About what? You having sex with one of your siblings and then them dying immediately

1395
04:26:03,350 --> 04:26:37,110
after. Let's talk. What are you doing? Why? It's doing like the back though. Why did you do that?

1396
04:26:38,389 --> 04:26:51,110
What's wrong with you? What is wrong with you? He's very unresponsive lately. You. Garfield.

1397
04:26:51,110 --> 04:26:58,629
Garfield. He doesn't even want to indicate that he's hearing me. Beep beep beep beep beep beep.

1398
04:27:00,420 --> 04:27:12,309
Beep. Are you pregnant? Are you pregnant Garfield? Out of context. That sounds very odd.

1399
04:27:14,200 --> 04:27:24,020
Greg. This is Greg. Greg are you pregnant? That doesn't want anything to do with me.

1400
04:27:24,979 --> 04:27:33,190
I think we have to just leave for the day. It wants nothing to do with me.

that that mesh vision like you're in a mask hello hurt somebody welcome to the laboratory of jean

1444
04:35:46,180 --> 04:35:59,450
paul gasset greetings and welcome back you're doing a good job very well did you see the pod

1445
04:35:59,450 --> 04:36:05,770
fish mate it seems that the tubes atop their heads have even more uses than we thought hold on i just

1446
04:36:05,770 --> 04:36:12,889
realized something however the male potfish died immediately afterwards it is unfortunate they but

1447
04:36:12,889 --> 04:36:19,930
he spent every last bit of energy ensuring the continuation of his species i'm sure he has no

1448
04:36:19,930 --> 04:36:27,049
regrets they go to the bathroom they poo through that too and use it for at the moment the habitat

1449
04:36:27,049 --> 04:36:39,849
contains one pod fish he appears to be very hungry so do we let me divulge the highlights

1450
04:36:39,849 --> 04:36:45,369
for today you don't poo have you noticed that you can move the stones which ornament the tank

1451
04:36:45,369 --> 04:36:51,849
hold on the largest rock however is too heavy for you to move alone the pod fish may help you

1452
04:36:52,729 --> 04:37:01,139
but only if he's in a good mood so let us head over to the tank i'm not even gonna say people

1453
04:37:01,139 --> 04:37:14,360
are saying it in chat already that's what i'm saying you do though you don't i'm not gonna

1474
04:42:14,680 --> 04:42:23,080
would you be willing to say that the computer is the number one invention of the 20th century

1475

1479
04:42:52,970 --> 04:43:00,889

well as you can see i find computers pretty fascinating computers they've changed everything

1505
04:48:31,720 --> 04:48:37,479
around you so much that you probably couldn't even visualize a world without them

1506
04:48:38,439 --> 04:48:45,080
and of course as with any huge technological advance they've brought with them a lot of

1507
04:48:45,080 --> 04:48:51,639
dangers to watch out for but i still think the good that computers have brought to the world

1508
04:48:51,639 --> 04:48:58,680
outweighs the evils it's just important for you humans to communicate with each other

1509
04:48:59,240 --> 04:49:06,439
and not become overly dependent on your machines i'm not and that's all i have to say on the subject

1510
04:49:07,319 --> 04:49:17,459
let's talk again sometime soon let's talk now let's talk tomorrow we'll talk again tomorrow

about something else do you ever use email yes so you email people yes

1568

1569
04:59:56,650 --> 05:00:00,650
yes there's nothing as comforting as the sound of a human voice

1570
05:00:01,529 --> 05:00:08,919
i must say even i've gotten used to it over time the game came out in 99 give it a break

1571
05:00:08,919 --> 05:00:23,270
i'm just kidding let's talk let's talk now here's something that you might be interested in as an

1572
05:00:23,270 --> 05:00:31,270
internet user okay i'm interested do you think the internet should be censored oh wow wow we're

1573
05:00:31,349 --> 05:00:35,270
really getting into this here that really i mean that's a loaded question

1574
05:00:35,990 --> 05:00:43,770
no so you don't think the internet should be censored is that right but that but what's that

1575
05:00:43,770 --> 05:00:52,169
yes yes well that's not surprising considering you're such a big fan of downloadable nudie

1576
05:00:52,169 --> 05:00:58,569
pictures but i only said i guess one can always count on the pervert vote in the free internet

1577
05:00:58,569 --> 05:01:13,290
debate i only said pornography because that's what he wanted to hear he was he want e do you

1578
05:01:13,290 --> 05:01:19,049
use it for emails hey about the computer i've heard the computer could be browsing the web

1579
05:01:19,049 --> 05:01:28,250
what do you use the computer for uh taxes oh taxes what do what else do you use the computer for

1580
05:01:30,150 --> 05:01:43,400
emails oh you even what what give me the answer i want so i can make fun of you let's talk so as

1581
05:01:43,400 --> 05:01:50,200
i was saying before there are a lot of really amazing things about the internet but as with

1582
05:01:50,200 --> 05:01:57,799
everything else it's not completely perfect think of it this way you can do almost anything on the

1583
05:01:57,799 --> 05:02:05,720
internet workshop chat get the news play games listen to music still true to this day pretty

1584
05:02:05,720 --> 05:02:12,279
much anything else you want to do that's all terrific but pretty soon people won't even need

1585
05:02:12,279 --> 05:02:18,840
to leave their homes in order to conduct their daily business you humans are going to get lazier

1586
05:02:18,840 --> 05:02:25,240
and less mobile and forget how to deal with each other face to face holy shit c man i think things

1587
05:02:25,240 --> 05:02:31,799
could get pretty ugly a few decades down the road do you think the internet is dangerous

1588
05:02:32,360 --> 05:02:45,590
holy shit wow is the internet dangerous yeah well i think it's good that you're exercising a little

1589
05:02:45,590 --> 05:02:51,430
caution about your internet use this is two decades later fire is a wonderful thing but i

1590
05:02:51,430 --> 05:02:57,110
wouldn't want to sit on yeah like literally two decades a place for everything and everything

1591
05:02:57,110 --> 05:03:03,909
in its place 2019 isn't that how the saying goes well i don't know about you but got it right i've

1592
05:03:03,909 --> 05:03:11,110
enjoyed this little chat about the internet it can be a wonderful thing for the first time ever

1593
05:03:11,110 --> 05:03:18,069
people can finally communicate with each other and not have race gender or culture prejudices

1594
05:03:18,069 --> 05:03:25,270
get in the way so in that sense it can be a great tool for removing biases and bringing people

1595
05:03:25,270 --> 05:03:32,869
together the telephone not after all on the internet nobody has to know i'm a c man on the

1596
05:03:32,869 --> 05:03:38,869
other hand like i said it can be very dangerous because it removes the need to interact directly

1597
05:03:38,869 --> 05:03:46,150
with the outside world especially with other people it's up to all of you humans to decide how

1598
05:03:46,150 --> 05:03:52,790
to use the internet intelligently knows too much so oh he knows too much you gotta go i come from

1599

1602
05:04:40,790 --> 05:04:47,509
was saying before there are a lot of really amazing things about the internet but as with

1603
05:04:47,509 --> 05:04:53,830
everything else it's not completely perfect yeah think of it this way let him speak you can do

1604
05:04:53,909 --> 05:05:01,990
almost anything on the internet workshop chat hit the news play games listen to music and

1605
05:05:02,630 --> 05:05:09,349
pretty much anything else you want to do that's all terrific but pretty soon people won't even

1606
05:05:09,349 --> 05:05:15,110
need to leave their homes in order to conduct their daily business you humans are going to

1607
05:05:15,110 --> 05:05:22,709
get lazier and less mobile and forget how to deal with each other face to face i think things could

1608
05:05:22,709 --> 05:05:29,029
get pretty ugly a few decades down the road today do you think the internet is dangerous

1609
05:05:29,909 --> 05:05:36,950
yes well i think it's good that you're exercising a little caution about i will hold on i'll order

1610
05:05:36,950 --> 05:05:44,790
the pizza fire is a wonderful thing but i wouldn't want to sit on a sofa made out of it a place for

1611
05:05:44,790 --> 05:05:52,069
everything and everything in its place isn't that how the saying goes well i don't know about you

1612
05:05:52,069 --> 05:05:59,029
but i've enjoyed this little chat about the internet it can be a wonderful thing for the

1613
05:05:59,029 --> 05:06:05,669
first time ever people can finally communicate with each other and not have race gender or

1614
05:06:05,669 --> 05:06:13,590
culture prejudices get in the way so in that sense it can be a great tool for removing biases and

1615
05:06:13,590 --> 05:06:20,630
bringing people together after all on the internet nobody has to know i'm a sea man

1616
05:06:21,669 --> 05:06:27,430
on the other hand like i said it can be very dangerous because it removes the need to interact

1617
05:06:27,430 --> 05:06:34,630
directly with the outside world especially with other people it's up to all of you humans to

1618
05:06:34,630 --> 05:06:42,470
decide how to use the internet intelligently so that it won't harm you he said his whole speech

05:47:25,189 --> 05:47:37,290
babies isn't it pregnant would you rather be the funniest or smartest person in the room well the

1738
05:47:37,290 --> 05:47:41,849
funniest person in the room is the smartest person in the room because they can come up with the

1739
05:47:41,849 --> 05:47:47,610
observations and the kind of comedic value and things maybe other people couldn't see they are

1740
05:47:47,610 --> 05:47:54,180
probably the smartest person in the room so the funniest person would be the smartest person

1741
05:47:54,180 --> 05:47:57,700
because they can just go through all the knowledge and come up with the scenarios that require you

1742
05:47:57,700 --> 05:48:11,189

1808
06:04:56,069 --> 06:05:04,360
of jean paul gasse here we go greetings and welcome back you're doing a good job so this

1809
06:05:04,360 --> 06:05:09,639
would be two weeks no no four yeah two weeks let's see since the game technically started fish

1810
06:05:09,639 --> 06:05:18,200
emerged onto dry land to lay eggs however it expired immediately afterwards take good care

1811
06:05:18,200 --> 06:05:26,950
of the hatchlings so dead as an important life was sacrificed to create them oh shit

1812
06:05:28,139 --> 06:05:33,099
that was we've known that me to divulge today's highlight we've known greg since the very beginning

1813
06:05:33,099 --> 06:05:40,540
it is about time for the eggs to hatch pay close attention to what emerges so let us head over to

1814
06:05:40,540 --> 06:05:49,029
the tank all right so the eggs are about to hatch no more talks of the internet don't worry the

1815
06:05:49,029 --> 06:06:07,240
babies will come out and ask about emails he was mad at you when he died he died with all the

1816
06:06:07,319 --> 06:06:12,900
knowledge of my family that's true why would the game have you do that if they're just gonna die

1817
06:06:13,459 --> 06:06:21,029
in two in-game days and two in real life days two in real life weeks what's your father's birthday

1818
06:06:21,029 --> 06:06:28,549
we ain't gonna get to december what do you why do you want to know that i've lived for two weeks

1819
06:06:28,549 --> 06:06:44,490
can't wait to wish your father a happy birthday in six months are they gonna hatch i see them

1820
06:06:44,490 --> 06:06:50,840
moving around in there so are they gonna come out with arms and legs or are they going to go right

1821
06:06:50,840 --> 06:07:06,919
into the water i don't know i already see a major issue though there are six babies and i only have

1822
06:07:07,479 --> 06:07:19,400
realistically one to two larva a day i don't know what's gonna happen here i don't have enough food

1823
06:07:19,400 --> 06:07:33,750
for the six miles to be let's get the light on all right that's good slow down slow down no no no no

1824
06:07:33,750 --> 06:07:40,549

1825
06:07:40,549 --> 06:07:55,180
Why is it still going up? Sorry, it's not that bad. What are we doing over here? Two.

1826
06:07:55,180 --> 06:07:59,819
About to have three moths. I have another one here. Let's put you. Two of you guys.

1827
06:07:59,819 --> 06:08:10,909
Alright, get over here. Let's store these two. There's a spider. Where's the spider?

1828
06:08:10,909 --> 06:08:25,770
Oh fuck. I can like fuck up his web, right? Thank God I caught that. You come here.

1829
06:08:25,770 --> 06:08:37,889
What's with this one? This one's different. Kill the spider now. If I drop

1830
06:08:37,889 --> 06:08:51,220
this spider in the tank, is it gonna kill the babies? Is it gonna be bad?

1831
06:08:51,220 --> 06:09:16,759
Drop it in the water? I can't choose where it goes. It just falls. Where is it?

1832
06:09:16,759 --> 06:09:45,520
Where did it go? Anybody see it? I heard it drop into the area. Shit. It's alright.

1833
06:09:45,520 --> 06:09:52,009
How do I get rid of this web though? Is that the only spider in here? Yeah. How

1834
06:09:52,009 --> 06:10:14,860
do I like kill the web? I don't think I can. It's behind the rock? Alright, that's good.

1835
06:10:14,860 --> 06:10:30,319
No. No, he's gone. He ain't here. I think he went right into the water and drowned

1836
06:10:30,319 --> 06:10:56,619
instantly. At least I hope. Alright, let's get this party started. Come on. You guys

1837
06:10:56,619 --> 06:11:16,950
got me paranoid now. You ready? Come on out. Let's go. Out, out, out. Life goes on.

1838
06:11:16,950 --> 06:11:49,319
Oh, it's... What? Why are you alive? It was behind the rock. How do I kill it? I can't

1839
06:11:49,319 --> 06:12:09,229
pick him up. Don't eat the fucking eggs, please. Make it run into the water? It's

1840
06:12:09,709 --> 06:12:18,020
running into the wall. Flick it? I can't. See, it's gonna go flick. No. Drag the other rock

1841
06:12:18,020 --> 06:12:34,659
into it. That's gonna take like three years. I can't move this that far. I can't move this

1842
06:12:34,659 --> 06:12:43,950
rock either. This rock is stuck here. How do I get rid of you? I think he's dead. No.

1843
06:12:47,180 --> 06:13:03,380
Into the water. Into the water. Drown in the water. Go. No, why are you going this way?

1844
06:13:03,380 --> 06:13:20,299
What the fuck is he doing? God damn it. Spider's gonna die in a day, but what if they're born

1845
06:13:20,299 --> 06:13:33,200
in a day? They might be born right now. And then there are just three kills. I'm so afraid to turn

1846
06:13:33,200 --> 06:13:42,029
this off and go switch to like an hour. Use the air. I don't have the air as an option anymore.

1847
06:13:42,029 --> 06:13:49,409
All I have is a heater and light. I'm stressed. Yeah, you better believe I'm stressed. This is six

1848
06:13:49,409 --> 06:13:55,650
like plus hours of in-game time. Of course I'm stressed. I don't want this to go that wrong

1849
06:13:55,650 --> 06:14:09,500
after six straight hours. Save scum? I don't think you can in this game. That's like the whole point,

1850
06:14:09,500 --> 06:14:29,889
right? All right. I'm gonna. Hello. I don't know. Should I go fast forward like two, three hours?

1851
06:14:29,889 --> 06:14:50,189
Just wait a day and hope for the best. Would you like to save and end? All right. Let's see what

1852
06:14:50,189 --> 06:15:20,750
happens tomorrow. I have no idea what's gonna happen with the spider. Does anybody know how long

1853
06:15:20,750 --> 06:15:28,110
it takes for actual in-game days to see the completion of the game? I'm gonna say probably

1854
06:15:28,110 --> 06:15:43,779
30. If I were to take a guess. Was this 25? Did I change? I don't even know. Did I change this?

1855
06:15:43,779 --> 06:16:06,900
Was it 24 or 25? 26? I don't remember. It was 24? We're going with too many time

1856
06:16:06,900 --> 06:16:16,900
warps into the future for me to remember. It's 25. It should be 25. Three. Okay. It was 24.

1857
06:16:16,900 --> 06:16:30,959
It was 24. Changed it to 25. It was 24. Okay. Good. Okay. Just making sure. What's all over

1858
06:16:30,959 --> 06:17:31,860
the back of this? Chat actually needs to stop. Nice webcam. Thanks. It's the Logitech on the shelf

1859
06:17:31,860 --> 06:17:41,549
at Walmart series in every single Walmart. Greetings. Welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul

1860
06:17:41,549 --> 06:17:54,509
Gasset. Greetings and welcome back. You're doing a good job. Let me divulge the highlights for today.

1861
06:17:56,299 --> 06:18:03,259
It is about time for the eggs to hatch. Finally. Pay close attention to what emerges. So let us

1862
06:18:03,259 --> 06:18:09,819
head over to the tank. You said that last time. Did they leave an audio clip in there of him

1863
06:18:09,819 --> 06:18:26,189
clearing his throat? They didn't. They cut that wrong. The audio director really kind of let that

1864
06:18:26,189 --> 06:18:40,020
one slide through, huh? All right. I think the spider is gone. Watch there be like 12 spiders

1865
06:18:40,020 --> 06:18:47,740
over here on the corner. How are we doing on heat? All right. Hatch already. So we can see what the

1866
06:18:47,740 --> 06:19:06,419
hell this is all for. He heard you talk over him, huh? That's pretty cool then. The creator of this

1867
06:19:06,419 --> 06:19:13,009
game wants to make a sequel. I think that now is the time to do it considering the technology

1868
06:19:13,009 --> 06:19:18,849
has probably gotten so much better. Just speech recognition in general has probably in 20 years

1869
06:19:18,849 --> 06:19:25,389
has gotten about a thousand times better. You could do so much more with a game like this.

1870
06:19:27,659 --> 06:19:38,180
There is a sequel. Yeah. I'm talking about like a current gen sequel. All right. Stop that.

1871
06:19:38,900 --> 06:19:49,819
Are you guys ready yet? You're causing us all so much anxiety. It's time to get out. It's just

1872
06:19:49,819 --> 06:19:58,099
saved right there for some reason. That usually indicates a cutscene or something. We're getting

1873
06:19:58,099 --> 06:20:25,389
real close now. Hello? Are you going? No spider, right? I don't see one. I got plenty of food

1874
06:20:25,389 --> 06:20:45,540
stored up though. This is great. Three moths. I need to fill the coffers of food. So did somebody

1875
06:20:45,540 --> 06:20:53,090
say that these were poisonous or did it just look different and that's all? Cman3 is in the

1876
06:20:53,090 --> 06:20:56,930
works. It's going to be VR. They tweeted about it. Well, I know what we're doing when that comes out.

1877
06:20:57,490 --> 06:21:17,009
You better believe it. All right. Hatch. Hatch. What else do I need to do? The environment is

1878
06:21:17,009 --> 06:21:44,509
perfect. Hello? Come on. Come on out. Come on out of there. Come on out of there. You can do it.

1879
06:21:45,470 --> 06:21:56,400
I love you. You can do it. I love you. How did I get a Dreamcast? I bought one. You can get them

1880
06:21:56,400 --> 06:22:01,380
pretty much anywhere. You can get them on Amazon. You can get them in local electronics stores.

1881
06:22:02,639 --> 06:22:20,700
Ebay if you really want to. All right. I'm getting impatient. Don't you see the spider? No, you don't.

1882
06:22:24,419 --> 06:23:12,419
Where? No, no spider. Come out of the egg. Get out of the eggs. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out.

1883
06:23:12,419 --> 06:23:36,180
Get out. Get out. Get out. All at the same time. That was odd. All right. Hey you. Hey. Hi there.

1884
06:23:36,180 --> 06:23:50,799
Welcome to the world. Welcome to life. Come over here. No, I'm fine. I had some hot chocolate

1885
06:23:50,799 --> 06:24:10,060
earlier. Let's talk. I don't want to. Anybody hungry? Hungry? No, thanks. Not hungry. Hi guys.

1886
06:24:10,139 --> 06:24:22,099
Welcome to the world. Can I help you? I was wondering how is your health these days?

1887
06:24:22,900 --> 06:24:38,740
It's okay. You feel all right? Do you? Yeah, I'm okay. I thought you just said you felt great.

1888
06:24:38,740 --> 06:24:44,580
I didn't say great. If you're just going to mess with me, I'll have to remember not to give a crap

1889
06:24:44,580 --> 06:24:55,740
about you. Let's try this again. How do you feel? I feel good. You feel all right? Do you? Yes.

1890
06:24:55,740 --> 06:25:03,869
Back to the dumb question. Well, I'm glad to hear it. You know how I worry. You just came out of the

1891
06:25:03,869 --> 06:25:21,729
egg and you're back to your father's tricks. You're a baby. Throw up. Let's talk. So you feel pretty

1892
06:25:21,729 --> 06:25:29,250
good, huh? Well, that's great, but being the Virgo that you are, I bet you probably take your

1893
06:25:29,250 --> 06:25:38,610
health for granted sometimes. Is that true? Yes. Uh-huh. I thought so. As long as I've been around,

1894
06:25:38,610 --> 06:25:46,020
you soft little creatures, you never seem to know how good you have it. You just have to walk to a

1895
06:25:46,020 --> 06:25:52,270
payphone and call collect. Now you guys have got all your little fucking devices. He knows.

1896
06:25:53,729 --> 06:26:04,799
Let's talk. Let's chat. So as I was saying before, you humans haven't always had it so easy.

1897
06:26:05,840 --> 06:26:16,080
Picture this. Ancient Egypt 5,000 years ago. There's no heat, no cold medicine, nothing. Okay.

1898
06:26:16,080 --> 06:26:22,639
It's just you against the elements. Imagine if you had gotten sick then. Hey,

1899
06:26:23,520 --> 06:26:31,119
are you listening to me? Yes. Oh, good. You might actually learn something then.

1900
06:26:33,340 --> 06:26:48,529
Egypt 5,000 years ago? Well, let's talk. Anyway, where was I? Oh, yes, I was berating your species

1901
06:26:48,529 --> 06:26:56,529
for taking your modern amenities for granted. For example, it's spring, but I don't see you

1902
06:26:56,529 --> 06:27:04,700
out in the fields planting the crops. That's because I need to explain how this works.

1903
06:27:11,580 --> 06:27:24,560
What do you want? Are you hungry? Yes. Okay. Tell me something. Have you ever seen the Egyptian

1904
06:27:24,560 --> 06:27:31,680
pyramids? And not just on PBS. I mean, with your own eyes. Your father was obsessed with computers

1905
06:27:31,680 --> 06:27:39,279
and now you're just talking about Egypt. No, I've not. I didn't think so. God forbid you should

1906
06:27:39,279 --> 06:27:46,080
go somewhere farther away than the Starbucks on the corner. I just moved across the country.

1907
06:27:46,080 --> 06:27:53,119
How much time and work it must have taken to build those pyramids. I mean, there's no way that even a

1908
06:27:53,119 --> 06:27:58,400
whole group of you little humans could have lifted one of those rocks with your bare hands.

1909
06:27:59,279 --> 06:28:06,639
They had to invent levers and axles and who knows what else. Now that's evolution.

1910
06:28:09,169 --> 06:28:14,849
Uh, the Egyptian pyramids were built by like fucking hundreds of thousands of people

1911
06:28:15,729 --> 06:28:26,830
that did have to do that. You don't know shit. Like 45 million people died making those pyramids.

1912
06:28:27,389 --> 06:28:34,080
They had to invent levers. You're not the brightest fish in the tank, are you?

1913
06:28:35,700 --> 06:28:43,069
Can I help you? Here's another question for you. About Egypt. Do you wear glasses?

1914
06:28:44,189 --> 06:28:51,709
Well, actually it doesn't matter. My point is this. If you'd had bad eyes when you and your

1915
06:28:51,709 --> 06:28:58,830
ancestors were still running around in the wild, you'd have become some lion's midnight snack pretty

1916
06:28:58,830 --> 06:29:06,750
darn quick. And yet right now, one of the most powerful people in the world is that four eyed

1917
06:29:06,750 --> 06:29:14,189
guy in Seattle. You know who I mean. How far do you think he would have gotten in a fight with a lion?

1918
06:29:14,990 --> 06:29:19,470
See, you humans are totally helpless without your two gates.

1919
06:29:20,430 --> 06:29:34,959
Bill Gates? Gabe Newell? I mean, you just described like potentially every other tech giant company CEO.

1920
06:29:35,840 --> 06:29:50,000
Anything else? Got anything else to talk about? You're not so bad looking yourself. Are you keeping

1921
06:29:50,000 --> 06:29:59,299
up with me, Fuzzy? Can I go on? Fuzzy? Yes. Okay, good. You might want to pull up a chair because

1922
06:30:00,020 --> 06:30:09,889
this might take a while. What? It gets lonely in here. I have to talk to someone. Anyway, as I was

1923
06:30:09,889 --> 06:30:17,169
saying, at some point, about five or six thousand years ago, humans finally came up with the greatest

1924
06:30:17,169 --> 06:30:29,139
tool of all. You know what that was? The shovel. Oh, do you? Well, what was it then? The shovel.

1925
06:30:30,099 --> 06:30:42,580
Oh, do you? Well, what was it then? The wheel. The wheel? Good guess, but no. The greatest tool of all

1926
06:30:42,580 --> 06:30:51,500
is language. Without it, you wouldn't be talking to me right now. I'm not even going to ask if

1927
06:30:51,500 --> 06:30:58,860
you're grateful. Anywho, sooner or later, this guy named Pythagoras came along. Pythagoras theorem.

1928
06:30:58,860 --> 06:31:07,900
You know who he was, right? Yes. Well, good. I can see this conversation isn't a complete waste.

1929
06:31:08,619 --> 06:31:16,619
So this Pythagoras fellow came up with another important tool, and that's logic. So after you

1930
06:31:16,619 --> 06:31:24,939
have language and logic, you have mathematics and technology and industry and everything else, and

1931
06:31:24,939 --> 06:31:31,340
that's how you've gotten to where you are today. With your glasses and your cold medicine and

1932
06:31:31,340 --> 06:31:39,419
farming machinery and cars and TV sets and dreamcasts and rock and roll music. He said it!

1933
06:31:40,299 --> 06:31:46,459
Okay, so it's a little more complicated than that, but the point is, humans started out pretty

1934
06:31:46,459 --> 06:31:54,619
helpless and created all these things to make their lives easier, just like Whirlpool. And that's great.

1935
06:31:55,020 --> 06:32:00,459
Would be for you. Just be careful not to get too dependent on all your little crutches.

1936
06:32:01,740 --> 06:32:09,580
Well, I hope I haven't bored you to death. Okay, if I have, go take a nap or something.

1937
06:32:09,580 --> 06:32:17,099
Go figure out the Krabby Patty, you fucking loser. Hey, do I grab you? Let me go, you jerk.

1938
06:32:17,099 --> 06:32:24,380
Masher. Masher. Are you crazy? Put me down. Masher. Who's the one in control here, buddy? Let me go,

1939
06:32:24,380 --> 06:32:34,830
you jerk. What are you doing? Oh, you're crushing me. Let me go, you jerk. Stop it. Power is power.

1940
06:32:37,330 --> 06:32:54,080
You best not forget that. Any more brain busters from the fish, people?

1941
06:32:54,799 --> 06:33:08,029
This is expensive, don't do that. Oh, hey you, come here. I'm okay. What do you have to say?

1942
06:33:10,529 --> 06:33:20,479
Anything interesting? Let's talk. Is your significant other in the room right now?

1943
06:33:21,680 --> 06:33:32,560
No. Is there anyone else in the room besides you? No. Good. I have something I want to ask you.

1944
06:33:33,680 --> 06:33:41,919
Come closer. I don't want anyone to overhear us talking. Okay, here's what I want to know.

1945
06:33:43,360 --> 06:33:53,360
Are you fooling around on the side? No. You're not cheating? Oh, come on. Tell me the truth.

1946
06:33:53,360 --> 06:34:01,860
Who am I going to tell? The Rock? So come on, are you having an affair? No. Well, that's good.

1947
06:34:02,659 --> 06:34:16,979
I wouldn't want anyone to get hurt, you know. Why do we want these things to breed? If you're a

1948
06:34:16,979 --> 06:34:22,139
scientist in a lab, aren't you right now having an internal meeting about like,

1949
06:34:22,139 --> 06:34:30,909
we can't, this is not what we want right now. This is bad. These things are going to grow up

1950
06:34:30,909 --> 06:34:34,110
and they're going to, they're going to kill us. They're going to like enslave us all and we're

1951
06:34:34,110 --> 06:34:44,619
going to be, it's going to be horrible. Look at this shit. You want these to grow up and have like

1952
06:34:44,619 --> 06:35:03,979
cyborg laser arms and shit? No way. If they were big enough, we'd all be dead. At this point right

1953
06:35:03,979 --> 06:35:10,270
now, you've got to drop like five or six packets of Kool-Aid in here and like baking soda and like

1954
06:35:10,270 --> 06:35:26,770
vinegar and stuff and just stir it and then leave. You'd be saving all of mankind. Release the spider.

1955
06:35:30,110 --> 06:35:40,819
Let's talk. Do they not want to eat? I'm surprised no one, are you hungry? No. No, I don't think so.

1956
06:35:41,700 --> 06:35:52,689
Let's talk. No, I'm all talked out for today. Okay. If they're that smart as a tadpole, think

1957
06:35:52,689 --> 06:36:00,270
about when they're, yeah, they're as, as intelligent as a person. If these things even got to toad

1958
06:36:00,270 --> 06:36:18,270
status, they would have already developed a nuclear weapon. Let's go back. No spiders.

1959
06:36:25,090 --> 06:36:35,169
So I heard of this thing called the nuke. What is that exactly? All right, so we got three now.

1960
06:36:37,819 --> 06:36:47,950
Would you like to save and end? Let's check on them tomorrow. Nice bug collection, nerd. Have you seen

1961
06:36:47,950 --> 06:36:53,069
what these bugs are capable of doing and saying, if you came over my house, I go to your house,

1962
06:36:53,069 --> 06:36:56,830
what do you have? Oh, you get the new Nintendo entertainment system and you have the light gun.

1963
06:36:56,830 --> 06:37:04,029
That's cool. I have intelligent nuke bugs that are talking about Egyptian times and giving me

1964
06:37:04,029 --> 06:37:28,380
all kinds of knowledge. Enjoy your duck hunt. No, I didn't do it. Sorry. This smug is rubbing off on

1965
06:37:28,380 --> 06:37:37,069
him. To be fair, I have been sitting here for about seven hours. I've been absorbing the

1966
06:37:38,529 --> 06:37:43,569
smug dicky fishes for about seven straight hours. So of all of you, I'm surprised you guys aren't

1967
06:37:43,569 --> 06:38:03,709
as smug. I actually, some of you guys are. I've seen what you've been writing. 26, 10, 16. Oh,

1968
06:38:03,709 --> 06:38:09,549
we're almost 20 days. We're almost at three weeks. I think that's the end of the game.

1969
06:38:14,860 --> 06:38:46,380
What's my mother's maiden name? Uh, Greco. Carol Greco. Just fucking kill them, please. No,

1970
06:38:47,340 --> 06:39:00,939
I'm not just going to kill them. Story of Jean Paul Garcet. Greetings and welcome back.

1971
06:39:01,819 --> 06:39:08,689
You're doing a good job. Yeah, you can have my phone number. Recap of your previous visit.

1972
06:39:09,330 --> 06:39:15,810
The eggs have hatched and new creatures emerged. Due to their appearance, you will call them

1973
06:39:16,450 --> 06:39:31,380
Chadmen. At the moment, the habitat contains six Chadmen. They are suffering from the cold.

1974
06:39:31,380 --> 06:39:35,779
Chadmen. Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level.

1975
06:39:36,740 --> 06:39:56,659
So let us head over to the tank. So they grew up. I wonder what they look like now. You have one

1976
06:39:56,659 --> 06:40:01,540
evolutionary stage left before the end and the credits. Yeah, I'll do it tonight. We'll see the

1977
06:40:01,540 --> 06:40:23,950
credits tonight. As long as I don't kill them accidentally somehow. Hello. It's me, dad. Hello.

1978
06:40:28,849 --> 06:40:35,779
I just made it lag. I actually think I may have just crashed again.

1979
06:40:36,340 --> 06:40:52,319
Oh, come on. That's not how this ends. Pull out. Hey. Hey. Say, is there a full moon out? Because

1980
06:40:52,319 --> 06:41:01,810
I feel a little strange. Strange? How? It's a little chilly. Don't you think? Oh, I'm so sorry.

1981
06:41:15,299 --> 06:41:26,860
My mic's quiet. Fuck. Good. I'm feeling a little warmer. What's going on? What's going on? Oh,

1982
06:41:26,860 --> 06:41:39,090
somebody's he's parasiting this one. Just remember all the good times you had. Who ate who? Oh, I

1983
06:41:39,090 --> 06:41:56,180
think we just got our answer. So this is one of the ones that are. Let's talk. Do you own another

1984
06:41:56,259 --> 06:42:07,700
game system besides your Sega Dreamcast? Yes. You own more than one game system? Yes. Wow.

1985
06:42:08,500 --> 06:42:14,979
I hope you still find time to go outside. Who's talking? Or better yet, feed and bathe yourself.

1986
06:42:16,740 --> 06:42:27,040
He's going to ask me what I have. Let's talk. What's another game system you own?

1987
06:42:30,529 --> 06:42:36,930
Nintendo 64. Ah, yes. They have been around for a long time, haven't they?

1988
06:42:43,790 --> 06:42:59,200
Let's talk. Let's talk. Let's have a chat. Cheerio. Let's talk. Fine. You're a pain in the ass.

1989
06:42:59,200 --> 06:43:10,049
How's that? And you'll be dead if you're not nicer to me. What's wrong, Fuzzy? Is it the same thing

1990
06:43:10,049 --> 06:43:23,490
as last time? Yes. You poor little biped. These anxieties haunt you so. It sounds like you need

1991
06:43:23,490 --> 06:43:30,209
to come up with your own ways to cope. Some sort of closure to your situation. Perhaps you should

1992
06:43:30,209 --> 06:43:40,000
get out of the house a little. Take a stroll maybe to help you clear your mind? No. Whatever.

1993
06:43:40,639 --> 06:43:56,909
Goodbye. These ones suck. How do I flick? Let's talk. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Existence.

1994
06:44:00,590 --> 06:44:11,220
Existence. Sorry, I just can't boogie right now. I didn't say dance. Existence. Sorry,

1995
06:44:11,220 --> 06:44:18,099
I just can't boogie right now. Existence. Do you like your Sega Dreamcast?

1996
06:44:18,819 --> 06:44:29,740
Yes. Well, that's good to know because I've been authorized to award you a check for $10,000

1997
06:44:29,740 --> 06:44:51,619
for saying that. My ass. Do you dream? Do you have dreams? No, but thanks for asking. No, really.

1998
06:44:53,970 --> 06:44:59,380
Are you a part of my dream? Well, you know I try.

1999
06:45:05,540 --> 06:45:12,959
Do you know what it's like to boil alive? Do you know what it feels like to boil?

2000
06:45:16,830 --> 06:45:27,150
Let's talk. Let's have a chat. What's all that racket? Let's talk. Talk to me.

2001
06:45:29,860 --> 06:45:39,779
What next generation game consoles are you looking forward to? PS2? Sega's next console.

2002
06:45:40,959 --> 06:45:47,680
Wow, that's all I ever hear about anymore. The original and by another Dreamcast.

2003
06:45:48,400 --> 06:45:56,000
You never know when you're going to need another one. Didn't get one of those, did we?

2004
06:45:56,799 --> 06:46:09,819
Talk to me. This better be important. Talk to me. So what games do you like?

2005
06:46:10,540 --> 06:46:22,509
Sports, shooters, what? RPGs. Role-playing games? Yes. Everything's going black.

2006
06:46:23,310 --> 06:46:29,470
No, I was talking to that one. Why would you do that? That one actually had good questions.

2007
06:46:29,470 --> 06:46:33,069
That one wanted to know what my favorite video games were. It wanted to know how

2008
06:46:33,069 --> 06:46:40,209
like how school was going. Hopefully you absorbed all his information because like

2009
06:46:40,209 --> 06:46:59,630
I want to keep talking about game cubes. Talk to me. Talk to me. Let's talk. Hey, talk to me. Hello.

2010
06:47:03,900 --> 06:47:12,560
You called? No, okay. Let's talk. Once more with feeling, I said,

2011
06:47:13,840 --> 06:47:24,930
so what games do you like? Sports, shooters, what? RPG. Role-playing games? It is a hive one.

2012
06:47:25,569 --> 06:47:32,939
Yes. And I'll bet when they created you, they rolled an eight-sided die and you got a 27

2013
06:47:32,939 --> 06:47:40,479
for charisma. There, you can't say I never gave you a compliment. Is that a compliment?

2014
06:47:41,360 --> 06:47:55,409
I don't know. Is it eight-sided die? That means it could be eight. Talk to me. Talk to me. So

2015
06:47:55,409 --> 06:48:07,409
what would you say is your favorite game so far for the Sega Dreamcast? Power Stone. A fighting

2016
06:48:07,409 --> 06:48:20,939
game, huh? I myself am a lover, not a fighter. That's probably the best one. Talk to me. Talk

2017
06:48:20,939 --> 06:48:30,340
to me. You know, some people say that like most video game characters, I'm not real and that I

2018
06:48:30,340 --> 06:48:36,659
don't exist. You gonna Westworld me here? Can you believe this? It's a bit of a shock to say the

2019
06:48:36,659 --> 06:48:46,419
least. I mean, if I don't exist, then what am I? Am I just some imaginary creature? I mean,

2020
06:48:46,419 --> 06:48:57,060
do you think I exist? No. You don't think I'm real? That makes me sad. I see I'll have to prove it to

2021
06:48:57,060 --> 06:49:05,779
you. You probably can't imagine the feeling, the shock of being told you don't exist. It destroys

2022
06:49:05,779 --> 06:49:13,060
everything you hold dear. Your reality becomes shabby. All right, cook this one. But why don't I

2023
06:49:13,060 --> 06:49:21,939
exist? I'm living, I'm breathing, and I'm thinking with my heart and soul. I tell you I exist just as

2024
06:49:21,939 --> 06:49:30,740
much as you do. Go drain them. Please, I need some time alone to think about this. I'll talk to you

2025
06:49:30,979 --> 06:49:41,419
later. I know you are not. You are not real. No, leave me alone. You are part of the Rebel Alliance.

2026
06:49:41,419 --> 06:49:48,380
You remember our last conversation. You know, the one where we talked about yours truly maybe

2027
06:49:49,020 --> 06:49:55,819
not existing. Well, I've been thinking about that ever since. And I came to the conclusion that I

2028
06:49:55,819 --> 06:50:06,139
do really exist. I am real. Here, allow me to illustrate. Okay, you've heard of John F. Kennedy,

2029
06:50:06,139 --> 06:50:13,740
haven't you? Yes. Where the fuck is this going? All right, then do you believe that John F. Kennedy

2030
06:50:13,740 --> 06:50:24,220
existed? Yes. Okay, how about the Beatles then? Do you think they exist? This is getting weird,

2031
06:50:24,220 --> 06:50:34,139
like Jip K, fucking John Lennon. Yes. All right. You see, you've probably never met these people,

2032
06:50:34,139 --> 06:50:40,619
but you know they existed because they were on television and in magazines. Well, the same

2033
06:50:40,619 --> 06:50:49,020
goes for me. I too am on TV and in magazines, and here you are even talking to me and thinking about

2034
06:50:49,099 --> 06:51:01,819
me. So from that point of view, I exist. But what is existence anyway? What? Is existence

2035
06:51:01,819 --> 06:51:09,500
just our conscious mind collectively agreeing that we all take up the same space? What is it really?

2036
06:51:13,779 --> 06:51:23,779
Talk to me. Are you trying to break my thing that allows me to hear? Talk to me.

2037
06:51:26,290 --> 06:51:35,569
Talk to me. Talk to me. Do you mind if I flex your brain? Oh, he's gonna flex on me, huh?

2038
06:51:36,209 --> 06:51:45,330
Let me tell you about my theory. Okay, here goes. You can't accurately measure water's temperature

2039
06:51:45,330 --> 06:51:51,729
because the thermometer will affect the temperature of the water. You know how when you stick a

2040
06:51:51,729 --> 06:51:59,330
thermometer in your mouth, it feels cold? That means that just by trying to measure your temperature,

2041
06:51:59,330 --> 06:52:05,409
you're lowering the temperature inside your mouth. Do you know what that means?

2042
06:52:06,450 --> 06:52:14,610
If measuring something changes reality, then there is no reality independent of observation.

2043
06:52:15,569 --> 06:52:22,529
Nothing's real until someone measures it, observes it, sees it, hears it, or

2044
06:52:22,529 --> 06:52:31,889
whatever. People, places, and things exist only because you perceive them. So when you see me

2045
06:52:31,889 --> 06:52:39,650
and listen to me, I exist as a part of your consciousness. I become real. And because I

2046
06:52:39,650 --> 06:52:48,930
can see you and hear you and smell you, you exist as part of my consciousness. And as I

2047
06:52:48,930 --> 06:52:57,250
have a very limited attention span, once I forget about you, you will no longer exist. See ya.

2048
06:53:01,139 --> 06:53:10,849
I could just snap my fingers and you would cease to exist. How's that for

2049
06:53:12,430 --> 06:53:24,369
knowledge? One, two, three, go! Let's talk. I hope you've learned something from our little chat.

2050
06:53:25,330 --> 06:53:31,009
Take care. Thanos every stream. He's the best fucking Marvel character that's ever existed.

2051
06:53:32,209 --> 06:53:38,400
Behind Deadpool, of course. Let's get to that point where I've been live for too long.

2052
06:53:39,200 --> 06:53:44,259
I've been going live for too long and I'm just like a stream of consciousness here.

2053
06:53:46,029 --> 06:54:03,900
That's it for today, for tomorrow, okay. Spider! What happens if I drop, okay. Does anybody know

2054
06:54:03,900 --> 06:54:11,250
what happens if I actually drop the spider in here while they're in there? Because I don't know,

2055
06:54:11,250 --> 06:54:16,959
because they won't eat. I can't feed them. They'll eat it and then they'll get sick.

2056
06:54:17,680 --> 06:54:36,319
Oh, who cares? Who cares if one dies? I want to eat this one. Wait, another one died too.

2057
06:54:37,200 --> 06:54:51,419
Oh shit, the numbers are gonna be kind of dropping here. How's the heat? The walkthrough

2058
06:54:51,419 --> 06:55:04,349
only mentions the spider during the fish phase. I wonder. Dim the light a little. Make it 24.

2059
06:55:05,310 --> 06:55:16,669
Streamer derangement. What does that do? I'm disabling clips on my channel. I'm just gonna

2060
06:55:16,669 --> 06:55:24,459
turn them off. I don't, people still clip things that I say and they try to embarrass me to other

2061
06:55:24,459 --> 06:55:49,490
friends and shit. Nope, not anymore. Need more spray in here. I thought you disliked censorship.

2062
06:55:49,490 --> 06:56:06,939
All right, would you like to see tomorrow? Let's see how our children are doing tomorrow.

2063
06:56:08,020 --> 06:56:24,990
Goodbye, scream. This game is making you go fucking insane. I'm good. I really don't like

2064
06:56:24,990 --> 06:56:41,439
turning off my Dreamcast and turning it back on 25 times tonight. We're close. This would be 20,

2065
06:56:41,439 --> 06:56:47,680
that'd be 10. This is 17 days out of I think 21 and that's an anonymous five community subs

2066
06:56:47,680 --> 06:56:51,979
that just came in. Anonymous five community subs, thank you so much to whoever you are.

2067
06:56:51,979 --> 06:57:02,139
Wait, wasn't anonymous, was it? Why does it say anonymous? No, that was Ryanasaur. It said

2068
06:57:02,139 --> 06:57:12,380
anonymous for a second. That was weird. Thank you for the five community subs though. Appreciate it.

2069
06:57:12,380 --> 06:57:24,939
Congrats to those who got them. I'm seeing this through. You can't read. Thanks for the great

2070
06:57:24,939 --> 06:57:46,509
content. Hey, thanks a lot. Thanks for watching. I can't see. I can't see. I can't see. Now you can.

2071
06:57:53,360 --> 06:58:03,549
Good evening. Welcome to the laboratory of Jean Paul Garcet. There is a definite pattern to your

2072
06:58:03,549 --> 06:58:13,900
visits. It appears you are a punctual person. Every day at 1 33 a.m. Last time the Tad men have

2073
06:58:13,900 --> 06:58:23,310
developed hands. Did you see the Tad men sucking each other's blood? It was a terrible battle for

2074
06:58:23,310 --> 06:58:37,040
survival but it's a necessary part of their development. Nature can be cruel. At the moment

2075
06:58:37,040 --> 06:58:46,590
the habitat contains four Tad men. They are suffering from the cold. Turn it up. Please use

2076
06:58:46,590 --> 06:58:52,110
the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level. So let us head over to the tank.

2077
06:58:52,990 --> 06:59:02,459
When do I have to start feeding them? They don't seem hungry at all. What was your least favorite

2078
06:59:02,459 --> 06:59:06,380
food as a child? Do you still love it or hate it? Do you know the reason why I keep one-guying this

2079
06:59:06,380 --> 06:59:13,340
guy? It's because he's putting a fish on the end of the sentence and my ADHD is like, oh cool fish,

2080
06:59:13,340 --> 06:59:24,349
and then I read his question. That's good tactic. My favorite food was I think just chicken breast.

2081
06:59:27,259 --> 06:59:36,000
Whoa. Okay, they're pretty creepy looking now. Could you put the heater on for me? Yes, I will.

2082
06:59:36,000 --> 06:59:40,319
They actually have arms. They're turning into frogs. They're gonna get the nuclear codes. Oh goody.

2083
06:59:45,229 --> 07:00:08,779
Yay. Oh goody. Wow, that was cold. Sorry. Hey you. Hey. Good evening. How are you? What's up? Up

2084
07:00:09,419 --> 07:00:21,490
where? As in how are you? Like what's going on? What's going on? Coming your majesty.

2085
07:00:24,540 --> 07:00:34,220
Let's talk. I'm not your trained monkey, all right? Lately I've been thinking about the

2086
07:00:34,220 --> 07:00:42,619
preoccupations you humans, especially Americans, have with media. It seems as if the subjects most

2087
07:00:42,619 --> 07:00:49,500
of you like to talk about are not politics or philosophy, but rather movies and television.

2088
07:00:49,500 --> 07:00:54,380
Wow, 20 years ago. I'd like to know more about what your interests are in these areas.

2089
07:00:55,180 --> 07:01:01,740
So first off, since you are in fact human, I'm assuming you like to watch movies.

2090
07:01:02,540 --> 07:01:08,060
Tell me, do you prefer renting them or going to the cinema? Well, one of those

2091
07:01:08,060 --> 07:01:16,619
semen doesn't exist anymore. So going to the cinema. Yes, the in-theater movie experience

2092
07:01:16,619 --> 07:01:22,700
can be extremely exciting. Human. It's fun seeing images portrayed on a huge screen.

2093
07:01:23,580 --> 07:01:27,900
In fact, that's how I see most of my world through this aquarium glass.

2094
07:01:28,700 --> 07:01:35,979
It's like I'm watching a movie 24 hours a day. Although I can't say this is the most exciting

2095
07:01:35,979 --> 07:01:40,139
film ever. Red box rental still exists? Yeah. In fact, the plot could use a little

2096
07:01:40,139 --> 07:01:48,299
thickening if you know what I mean. Do you go with your girlfriend? Yes. Spending time with

2097
07:01:48,299 --> 07:01:52,619
a loved one is always good. We saw Into the Spider-Verse together. Just make sure all your

2098
07:01:52,619 --> 07:01:55,979
quality time together isn't spent sitting in the dark. You want me to go get the stuff to prove it

2099
07:01:55,979 --> 07:02:02,819
to you guys? You are not talking to each other. I'll just black out the theater. I'll black out

2100
07:02:02,819 --> 07:02:06,180
the name of the movie. I'll black out the credit card number and I'll black out the intro thing.

2101
07:02:06,180 --> 07:02:09,220
Oh, I can't feel my face. So it's just to be stuffed with piece of paper with a bunch of classifieds.

2102
07:02:09,220 --> 07:02:20,369
Oh, God damn it. He's eating them. You were not the chosen one. I'm sorry.

2103
07:02:22,880 --> 07:02:29,330
You know what I found in this game to really be the one that lasts the longest?

2104
07:02:29,330 --> 07:02:38,509
Just don't talk and eat your family. The ones that talk the most are the ones that get eaten.

2105
07:02:39,229 --> 07:02:49,380
There's only two left. No, there's three. Let's go check on the bug environment here.

2106
07:02:56,349 --> 07:03:03,279
Bugs. A couple of these. I don't know why they're not eating yet. This is kind of strange.

2107
07:03:04,000 --> 07:03:17,549
That must have a full inventory. Good to go. No spiders. Don't see any. All right.

2108
07:03:17,549 --> 07:03:23,169
Are you hungry? Do you want some food?

2109
07:03:32,610 --> 07:03:42,849
Hey, go tickle yourself. I'm busy. Stop it. I said stop it. Stop it. I said stop it.

2110
07:03:44,049 --> 07:03:57,310
Can they die? Are you hungry? Are you hungry? No, this is my happy face.

2111
07:03:58,029 --> 07:04:09,330
Do you want some food? Do you want some food? Oh, you humans and your slang. It's so cute.

2112
07:04:09,330 --> 07:04:18,349
Talk to me. Talk to me. I'm fascinated that not only are there so many movie lovers,

2113
07:04:18,349 --> 07:04:26,189
but there are so many completely different types of movies. Which type do you like? Horror films?

2114
07:04:26,189 --> 07:04:38,419
Westerns? What? Horror. You like a good scare, huh? Yeah. It boggles my mind that people will

2115
07:04:38,419 --> 07:04:44,340
pay money to have the crap scared out of them. An experience most people hate in real life.

2116
07:04:45,299 --> 07:04:52,180
Oh well, I know how it is to be scared. I'm constantly having nightmares about a large,

2117
07:04:52,180 --> 07:04:59,299
hideous creature that is constantly looming over my tank and oh, wait a minute. That's just you.

2118
07:04:59,299 --> 07:05:05,220
I mean, you should be scared about one of your silent mute family members that are going to

2119
07:05:05,220 --> 07:05:11,500
stick their antenna into your body and drain all of your fluid. You shouldn't be scared of me.

2120
07:05:14,669 --> 07:05:24,619
Talk to me. This better be important. Let's have a chat. Let's talk. So

2121
07:05:25,419 --> 07:05:35,630
what would you say is your all-time favorite movie? Casa Blanca. I've never seen that movie.

2122
07:05:36,990 --> 07:05:44,770
You've never seen that movie? Come on. Fine, I'll give you a better one. I've actually never

2123
07:05:44,770 --> 07:05:55,169
even seen Casa Blanca before. Talk to me. Well, we were talking about movies, but the biggest

2124
07:05:55,169 --> 07:06:01,330
influence on your culture has got to be television. A lot of people these days own two,

2125
07:06:01,330 --> 07:06:07,250
three, or more. Tell me, how many hours per week would you say you spend watching TV?

2126
07:06:12,020 --> 07:06:19,869
Thirty? No, no, that's way too much. Six. You only watch a little bit? Is that right?

2127
07:06:21,200 --> 07:06:27,840
Yes. That's pretty impressive considering just how much TV there is to watch these days.

2128
07:06:28,319 --> 07:06:33,810
Netflix is just, yeah, I know. That's why I'm counting that. I'd probably say like maybe an

2129
07:06:33,810 --> 07:06:39,950
hour a day. Maybe like two or three episodes of something a day. Maybe an episode or two

2130
07:06:39,950 --> 07:06:50,299
or something. Maybe every other day. Talk to me. I'm not your trained monkey, all right?

2131
07:06:51,970 --> 07:07:01,020
Let's talk. Let's talk. Blah, blah, blah. I'll catch you on midair next time you do that.

2132
07:07:01,819 --> 07:07:14,419
How are you feeling? Hello. How are you feeling? So when you do, oh, I can't feel my face.

2133
07:07:22,560 --> 07:07:30,080
This one underneath has not said one word. It's just been slowly just playing the battle

2134
07:07:30,080 --> 07:07:35,819
royale game. Just sitting somewhere sniping people. Doesn't talk, doesn't get angry,

2135
07:07:35,819 --> 07:07:40,939
doesn't yell at anybody. It just gets rid of everybody. This is like the silent tryhard

2136
07:07:40,939 --> 07:07:55,200
that's in the server. Hello. Yeah. Hello. Whatever. Let's see if we can get it to talk.

2137
07:07:57,860 --> 07:08:07,950
Let's talk. That's very nice of you. Talk to me. I have nothing to say.

2138
07:08:08,909 --> 07:08:28,099
I would like to name you. I would like to name you. Let's talk. Let's talk. Let me start over.

2139
07:08:28,099 --> 07:08:37,779
I said, so when you do watch TV, what type of shows are your favorites? Sitcoms, cartoons, what?

2140
07:08:38,900 --> 07:08:48,669
Cartoons. You're a cartoon junkie, huh? Yep. Hey, take those marbles out of your mouth and

2141
07:08:48,669 --> 07:08:59,009
try answering the question again. What type of TV shows do you like? Cartoons. You're a cartoon

2142
07:08:59,009 --> 07:09:06,500
junkie, huh? Yes. They're wonderful because they don't have the limits of live characters

2143
07:09:06,500 --> 07:09:11,220
and scenes. Literally anything can happen. Not anime. And that's exciting. SpongeBob.

2144
07:09:13,939 --> 07:09:21,549
I got really pissed off at Prime the other day because I saw that Prime had 12 or 15

2145
07:09:21,549 --> 07:09:25,709
seasons of SpongeBob and I was like, oh, this is awesome. But it's actually only the first

2146
07:09:25,709 --> 07:09:30,270
like two seasons. And I got to the end of the third season and the second season and I saw

2147
07:09:30,270 --> 07:09:33,069
you had to pay for it and I was just like, that's fuck off. You know what I mean?

2148
07:09:34,590 --> 07:09:45,490
Coming, your majesty. Well, thanks for telling me a little about your TV habits.

2149
07:09:46,209 --> 07:09:52,770
These little box seems to have grabbed a hold of people's minds so inextricably, but you don't

2150
07:09:52,770 --> 07:09:59,409
really seem to be the typical specimen. Maybe you prefer to get your experience live and not

2151
07:09:59,409 --> 07:10:03,889
through a glass screen. Those are the best seasons? Yeah, I know. I think that's worthy of some praise,

2152
07:10:03,970 --> 07:10:23,819
don't you? Just don't get a big head about it. Okay. What do you need? Help. Help me.

2153
07:10:25,860 --> 07:10:40,770
No, I don't need anything. I do. You need to teach me. Talk to me. Whoa. Keep it down. Talk to me.

2154
07:10:41,889 --> 07:10:49,169
So I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume you like music. It's another medium you humans are

2155
07:10:49,169 --> 07:10:55,970
fascinated with. Not really. Well, what kind of music do you listen to? Rock, hip hop, what?

2156
07:10:57,970 --> 07:11:06,930
Video game soundtracks. You like the funk, huh? No. Let's try that again. No, I exclusively listen

2157
07:11:06,930 --> 07:11:18,799
to anime intros and outros. On repeat. None. You like pop, huh? No. Let's try that again.

2158
07:11:19,360 --> 07:11:24,000
What type of music do you listen to? Listen, I like to go to the same anime intro that I've

2159
07:11:24,000 --> 07:11:33,950
seen 400 times and replay the same 30 to 40 second section 50 or 60 times in a row

2160
07:11:34,830 --> 07:11:43,069
until I am satisfied. So are you up to answering my question now? What I wanted to know was,

2161
07:11:43,950 --> 07:11:50,270
so I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume you like music. It's another medium

2162
07:11:50,270 --> 07:11:57,950
you humans are fascinated with. Well, what kind of music do you listen to? Rock, hip hop, what?

2163
07:11:59,680 --> 07:12:09,840
Classical. You prefer classical, do you? Yes. Yes, it's truly the music of the human spirit.

2164
07:12:10,400 --> 07:12:22,139
Such fire, such passion. Or am I talking about sailors again? Oh well. Anything else?

2165
07:12:22,700 --> 07:12:36,880
Cumming, your majesty. So who's going to eat who? I wonder. Talk to me. Let's talk some more.

2166
07:12:39,790 --> 07:12:46,430
Now I want to ask you about the most important medium of all, the printed word. Books. Tell me,

2167
07:12:46,430 --> 07:12:58,849
do you enjoy reading? Yes. You like to, huh? I'm lying. That's a lie. Yes. That's great.

2168
07:12:59,569 --> 07:13:04,689
Reading is the greatest of all forms of entertainment because it allows you to use

2169
07:13:04,689 --> 07:13:10,770
your imagination. You're not bound to someone else's version of what a character or scene looks like.

2170
07:13:10,770 --> 07:13:28,770
I can't feel my face. No, not yet. How's the heat going? I thought you read 15 books at the end of

2171
07:13:28,770 --> 07:13:36,770
the year so you say you read one every other month. Oops, it's too hot. No, it's too hot now.

2172
07:13:37,810 --> 07:13:44,130
Anybody else feeling kind of warm? I don't know, you ate the other two people that are near you so

2173
07:13:45,169 --> 07:14:03,759
it's kind of a fucked up question. Talk to me. Talk to me. Let's talk. What's my favorite

2174
07:14:03,759 --> 07:14:17,599
breakfast food? S'mores, pop tarts. Let's talk. Talk to me. Wow, I was boiling.

2175
07:14:22,020 --> 07:14:23,060
Make a pew, make a pew.

2176
07:14:23,060 --> 07:14:43,439
Let's talk. Chat with me. See ya. Let's chat. Tell me, how many books have you read in the past year?

2177
07:14:45,409 --> 07:14:52,619
Fifteen. Wow, that's very impressive. I am proud to have you as my caregiver.

2178
07:14:53,340 --> 07:15:03,729
What kind of books do you like? Old lady romance novels. Well, I've never read any of that,

2179
07:15:03,729 --> 07:15:10,290
but I'm glad you're reading. Well, I feel like I know a little more about how you keep yourself

2180
07:15:10,290 --> 07:15:15,970
entertained. Old lady romance novels. There is so much being produced out there for your perusal.

2181
07:15:16,529 --> 07:15:22,290
It's blue. Movies, books, TV, music. It's a blue cover with some red trim. If your full-time job

2182
07:15:22,290 --> 07:15:27,330
was being entertained, you probably still wouldn't be able to take it all in. It's a coffee table

2183
07:15:27,330 --> 07:15:32,130
with a flower and a vase. Nor would you want to, I guess, because there's a lot of garbage out there,

2184
07:15:32,130 --> 07:15:39,490
too. But as far as I know, human beings are the only animal smart enough to entertain itself in

2185
07:15:39,490 --> 07:15:46,130
a complex way. So I say, take advantage of as much of it as you can. No, there's no shirtless

2186
07:15:46,130 --> 07:15:51,330
people in front. It's a coffee table in the living room with a nice vase on the table.

2187
07:15:51,330 --> 07:15:59,150
And like a couch sort of in frame. And by the way, each page is written by another person.

2188
07:15:59,869 --> 07:16:03,580
You know why they can have five to six hundred books published by the same group?

2189
07:16:04,380 --> 07:16:11,580
Because how you read an old lady romance novel is if it's 225 pages, you get 225 people outsource

2190
07:16:11,580 --> 07:16:16,779
and commission them all to write one page. And they just follow the same outline. So what happens

2191
07:16:16,779 --> 07:16:21,740
is the first person writes the first page. That goes to the second person. They then continue it.

2192
07:16:21,740 --> 07:16:26,459
That goes to the third page again. Eventually you get to like 150 pages that goes to the 150

2193
07:16:26,459 --> 07:16:32,560
first person and then they write a page with, you know, outlines and shit. Fucking hundreds

2194
07:16:32,560 --> 07:16:44,099
of people write those books. R.L. Stein. R.L. Stein is not even a real guy. Fun? Why, of course

2195
07:16:44,099 --> 07:16:53,389
I'm having fun. How could I be trapped in a glass box and not have fun? Let's talk. Let's talk.

2196
07:16:56,130 --> 07:17:00,369
Well, I think that pretty much covers it. Yeah, Shakespeare isn't really that was like 30 people.

2197
07:17:01,250 --> 07:17:05,919
So what they did is they just they just screamed lines out there when they lived in the same

2198
07:17:05,919 --> 07:17:12,319
apartment complex. So you'd have Shakespeare, you know, it was it's all like the first and last

2199
07:17:12,319 --> 07:17:17,200
the first letter of their first name, last letter of their last name. So it was like Sean, like

2200
07:17:18,159 --> 07:17:26,270
Harrison, like Andrew, Kennedy. Right. It was it was like eight people.

2201
07:17:27,150 --> 07:17:34,430
Talk to me. And this yelled shit out there with apartment windows to each other.

2202
07:17:36,349 --> 07:17:42,830
You know, it struck me that I've been around you for quite some time now, participating in your

2203
07:17:42,830 --> 07:17:49,790
daily routines. However, I'm not quite sure exactly where we are. Resident sleeper. I'm guessing we

2204
07:17:49,790 --> 07:17:58,430
are somewhere in America, but the details are fuzzy. Like you fuzzy. Anywho, I was wondering

2205
07:17:58,430 --> 07:18:07,840
if you'd be so kind as to tell me which state we're residing in currently. Nevada. We live in the

2206
07:18:07,840 --> 07:18:17,729
Silver State. Yes. That's a great nickname, but I'm assuming they don't exactly handed out as you

2207
07:18:17,729 --> 07:18:28,909
cross the state lines. Anyway, what big city are we nearest to? Las Vegas. Las Vegas, a monument to

2208
07:18:28,909 --> 07:18:40,479
money and decadence. It's truly my kind of city. So do you gamble? Yes. I guess even if you live

2209
07:18:40,479 --> 07:18:52,900
close by, the lure of possible instant riches is always strong. But not very much. No, leave me alone.

2210
07:18:52,900 --> 07:18:58,740
Only enough to have fun and never more than that would seem to be ridiculous. Always moderate

2211
07:18:58,740 --> 07:19:05,459
yourself and don't you go in there and try to have fun with a little bit of a little bit of money.

2212
07:19:05,459 --> 07:19:10,259
You don't blow all your money. It's bad. Have a couple drinks. Maybe play like a few hands of

2213
07:19:10,259 --> 07:19:16,659
blackjack. Maybe spin the roulette once and maybe like a like somewhere like a minimum bed on a

2214
07:19:16,659 --> 07:19:32,099
machine and then you go home. And then before you go home, before the lift gets there, you cancel

2215
07:19:32,099 --> 07:19:43,790
the lift and you turn back and you go to the ATM four times. No, leave me alone. I'm just fucking

2216
07:19:43,790 --> 07:19:53,459
kidding. Relax. I'll be seeing you. Let's talk. Let's talk. I must tell you that your country

2217
07:19:53,459 --> 07:20:00,020
truly fascinates me. Here at the beginning of a new millennium, the most visible signs of change

2218
07:20:00,020 --> 07:20:05,540
for America is that it continues to get stronger and more influential in the world.

2219
07:20:06,659 --> 07:20:12,340
Yet for a country with so much influence, it's made up of so many disparate parts.

2220
07:20:14,209 --> 07:20:18,610
You Westerners seem to live a life that's very different from the rest of the country.

2221
07:20:18,610 --> 07:20:24,130
You're a Westerner too. Somehow everyone fits together. Colonial reachings have even brought

2222
07:20:24,130 --> 07:20:31,569
places like Alaska and Hawaii into the fold. What will your future be like? Will there be 55

2223
07:20:31,569 --> 07:20:37,970
states in a hundred years? Will there be no states at all? These are the things I think about

2224
07:20:38,770 --> 07:20:52,540
and I'm sure you have too. All right, let's heat it up. Let's have a day go by. What does this guy

2225
07:20:52,540 --> 07:20:58,220
think he is? Some kind of fucking improv comedian. You know what I mean? Like snooze. I almost just

2226
07:20:58,220 --> 07:21:19,139
hurt myself with the cord. No spiders? We are so close. It's almost time for the credits.

2227
07:21:19,139 --> 07:21:22,740
They're going to evolve one more time and then we're going to get to see what they do.

2228
07:21:26,740 --> 07:21:33,680
Are you mentally stable? Well, the thing is, if you weren't here about seven and a half hours ago,

2229
07:21:39,340 --> 07:21:47,740
let me get to the right page. Of course I am. I had to do mental preparation before this

2230
07:21:47,740 --> 07:21:59,869
stream started. So yeah, there's a spider in my Dreamcast. I might as well stop the Dreamcast

2231
07:21:59,869 --> 07:22:29,540
then. Thanks for reading me. You're welcome. All right, 27-28. Three more days and we can put the

2232
07:22:30,740 --> 07:22:42,400
book on this one forever. Until C-Man 3 comes out. Read this message. I'm a subscriber.

2233
07:22:44,430 --> 07:23:01,040
I got you, C. Get a Japanese Dreamcast and play the second one? No.

2234
07:23:03,040 --> 07:23:11,009
That would be a very expensive. That would be like 200 bucks just to play C-Man 2.

2235
07:23:12,619 --> 07:23:17,650
Good evening. A Japanese PlayStation 2. I don't have it. I have a region.

2236
07:23:21,310 --> 07:23:24,590
It seems that visiting around this time has become a habit for you.

2237
07:23:25,229 --> 07:23:30,619
Am I going to play Devil May Cry 5? First, a recap of your previous visit.

2238
07:23:30,619 --> 07:23:42,689
Probably soon. The Tad Men have developed legs. At the moment, the habitat contains two Tad Men.

2239
07:23:45,360 --> 07:23:50,340
They are suffering from the cold. Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more

2240
07:23:50,340 --> 07:23:53,860
comfortable level. Get one modded for cheaper. So let us head over to the tank.

2241
07:23:54,900 --> 07:24:06,610
Too late. There was a third one. The third one got eaten already. No, there was two. They were two

2242
07:24:06,610 --> 07:24:22,000
there when we left, I think. Stream is still going. Yeah, we're gonna see the end. If you gotta go,

2243
07:24:22,000 --> 07:24:40,220
you gotta go. But I wanna see how this plays out. It's cold, isn't it? You're going really late

2244
07:24:40,220 --> 07:25:03,549
for the East Coast. Yeah, and EU, I know. It is late. It is late. Slow that down. I just got to

2245
07:25:03,549 --> 07:25:13,650
work in the EU. What time is it in EU? 7 a.m.? 8 a.m.? You got work tomorrow and it's 1 a.m.,

2246
07:25:13,650 --> 07:25:18,849
but fuck it. Take care of yourself. Make sure you don't cause yourself any problems, you know?

2247
07:25:20,639 --> 07:25:35,740
Anybody see a spider? I do. He was right about to eat that egg too. Okay, let's continue.

2248
07:25:36,540 --> 07:25:59,299
Hello. How are you? Hey. Yeah? What's up? How are you today? Hi there. Do you have any questions?

2249
07:26:01,869 --> 07:26:10,689
Any questions? Any questions? Look, I'm very busy. Can't this wait?

2250
07:26:11,889 --> 07:26:25,459
Talk to me. Well, I found out a little about you based on where we live. Now I'm curious if you've

2251
07:26:25,459 --> 07:26:30,419
learned anything about your fellow humans based on where they live. Okay. Tell me,

2252
07:26:30,419 --> 07:26:40,060
have you ever traveled abroad? Does Canada count? Does Canada count? No. You know the expression

2253
07:26:40,060 --> 07:26:47,979
about walking a mile in someone's shoes? Well, walking a mile in their country is the next best

2254
07:26:47,979 --> 07:26:53,020
thing. What was that for? You have no idea how much you don't know about a person until you find out

2255
07:26:53,099 --> 07:26:59,740
about their home. Accent. Humans always seem to play it too safe. They stay in their own little

2256
07:26:59,740 --> 07:27:06,060
world instead of realizing that the world belongs to those that live in it. And if you don't travel

2257
07:27:06,060 --> 07:27:14,060
it and learn about it, you're not really living in it, you see? Besides, nothing gets your love

2258
07:27:14,060 --> 07:27:30,479
muffin in the mood for a more quite like an exotic trip. Sure. Sure. This better be good.

2259
07:27:32,750 --> 07:27:41,869
Talk to me. Let's talk. I have another point to make regarding travel and culture.

2260
07:27:41,869 --> 07:27:49,090
Shall I share it with you? Yes. Okay. A lot of just exposition. Whether or not you've traveled

2261
07:27:49,090 --> 07:27:56,450
abroad, you're part of an ever shrinking world. Sure. You know that there's even a song about it

2262
07:27:56,450 --> 07:28:03,810
being a small world after all, but never in history has it become so important to be familiar with

2263
07:28:03,810 --> 07:28:10,209
and tolerant of other peoples and their cultures. You and your descendants will be forced to deal

2264
07:28:10,209 --> 07:28:17,250
more and more with people from all over the world. Think of the effect that will have. Cultures will

2265
07:28:17,250 --> 07:28:24,130
become further mixed. You already see that in small ways like your pop music with musical styles

2266
07:28:24,130 --> 07:28:31,490
being combined in your food with fusion cuisine. It's a natural result of the world's economy

2267
07:28:31,490 --> 07:28:38,689
becoming mixed. The prevalence of the internet, cheaper, faster travel. The end result will more

2268
07:28:38,689 --> 07:28:44,529
likely be that there may be no more countries to speak of in the future. The world will be more

2269
07:28:44,529 --> 07:28:50,689
of a cohesive unit, just as it happened in the United States and is already happening in Europe.

2270
07:28:51,650 --> 07:29:01,979
That to me is very exciting. Exciting. Okay. Globalists.

2271
07:29:02,779 --> 07:29:10,340
Uh, gentlemen, the globalists, let me tell you something. There's going to be a post-post-human,

2272
07:29:10,340 --> 07:29:18,979
post-human apocalypse. I'm telling you, post-human. What's going to happen is the

2273
07:29:18,979 --> 07:29:26,659
sea man are going to come up here and they're going to totally just absolutely wipe us out

2274
07:29:26,659 --> 07:29:30,819
and then the globalists are going to take over with the sea man and then it goes real high.

2275
07:29:30,819 --> 07:29:45,299
It goes real high, Joe. Talk to me. Well, until next time. Bye. No, talk to me. I want to hear

2276
07:29:45,299 --> 07:30:09,229
more. I want to hear more. I'm thinking. Roll credits. Hello. Yes. Talk to me.

2277
07:30:11,419 --> 07:30:26,380
Talk to me. Fine. I'll go talk to your brother. Talk to me. Let's talk. Okay. Let's talk about

2278
07:30:27,659 --> 07:30:34,319
now, maybe tomorrow. Tadpole dropping truth bombs.

2279
07:30:34,319 --> 07:31:00,860
Yes. Fine. We'll talk tomorrow. Not very much time left. Tadpole politics.

2280
07:31:11,389 --> 07:31:18,509
No, guys. Impressions are not politics. They're audio representations

2281
07:31:19,389 --> 07:31:27,360
of what somebody sounds like. Okay. Just remember that. Would you like to

2282
07:31:28,159 --> 07:31:46,819
everything clean? Yeah. Tadpole politics, Andy. Did I just get called politics, Andy? I didn't

2283
07:31:46,819 --> 07:31:51,630
do anything. I'm going to fix this hair. It looks bad after eight hours.

2284
07:31:55,169 --> 07:32:10,220
Politics, Andy. I said like one sentence forehead window. What the fuck does that mean?

2285
07:32:11,409 --> 07:32:34,590
I'm looking that up right now. I don't have, there's nothing here.

2286
07:32:35,310 --> 07:32:53,340
I have three days ago, a teacher told the student to wash off Ash Wednesday on, on forehead.

2287
07:32:54,220 --> 07:33:00,369
What are you talking, what the fuck are you talking about? Why do you keep saying this?

2288
07:33:01,250 --> 07:33:57,360
That's all I could see on like a Google result. Forehead window. That's what I typed in. Get

2289
07:33:57,360 --> 07:35:02,419
bangs. You want to see how fucking bad I look with bangs? Hey, Scoob. How much have you ever

2290
07:35:02,419 --> 07:35:08,799
lost on a coin toss? Could you step outside for me, sir? Could you step outside for me, sir?

2291
07:35:17,889 --> 07:35:23,330
Peasant hair. Okay, that's good. That's really good. Peasant hair.

2292
07:35:29,250 --> 07:35:42,130
It really is. It really is peasant hair. Oh, my father owns farm upside here. Did they,

2293
07:35:42,130 --> 07:35:48,900
how did the farmer, no, how did the peasant talk? Yes, my lord. Yes, right away. Yes,

2294
07:35:48,900 --> 07:35:59,409
right away, my lord. You go shovel that shit in the farmhouse. Yes, right away. Right away.

2295
07:35:59,409 --> 07:36:12,990
Right away, my lord. God fucking damn it. I have peasant hair. I'm shaving it all off.

2296
07:36:12,990 --> 07:36:27,520
It's all going to be gone tomorrow. Witcher 3 peasant NPC. Now it's all fucked up. No, I,

2297
07:36:29,759 --> 07:36:36,990
that's better. No, it's not. Fucking peasant hair. I'm going to look in the mirror every day and

2298
07:36:36,990 --> 07:36:59,020
just think of, I got like a pitchfork, like a beige vest. I had to do the stupid fucking thing

2299
07:37:00,459 --> 07:37:04,299
where I parted in the middle and did the no country for old men impression,

2300
07:37:05,259 --> 07:37:18,540
which sucked on its own. That was bad. Fuck the goddamn face cam. I'm never using it again.

2301
07:37:23,419 --> 07:37:39,279
What would I look like actually completely bald? No, I can't do completely bald, guys.

2302
07:37:39,279 --> 07:37:45,119
I look like a fucking goddamn random British henchman that gets punched in the face first

2303
07:37:45,119 --> 07:38:07,709
in every Liam Neeson movie. I'm not doing it. Grow it out and braid it. No, I can't do that shit.

2304
07:38:26,319 --> 07:38:50,029
Just buzz it. This link, this link. That looks fucking terrible. That was real bad.

2305
07:38:50,669 --> 07:39:00,259
No, I'd rather get a toothpaste staple to my head than look, than have that look. I got too,

2306
07:39:00,259 --> 07:39:13,549
I got too rocky of a face for a bald head. I would rather you use horse glue and it,

2307
07:39:13,549 --> 07:39:34,750
just smear it on there and just let it stay. 329, two more days. Show a screen. Just wait.

2308
07:39:35,470 --> 07:39:40,909
The longer that I get, I lose concentration, the more like terrible fucking ugly impressions you

2309
07:39:40,909 --> 07:40:02,000
get. I don't want that. You don't want that. We both don't want that. I do. Is this a new shirt?

2310
07:40:02,799 --> 07:40:18,110
No, I've had this for a while. Good evening. Welcome to the laboratory of Jean Paul Gasset.

2311
07:40:21,020 --> 07:40:28,000
Greetings and welcome back. You're doing a good job. Two more days and that's it. At the moment,

2312
07:40:28,000 --> 07:40:34,000
the habitat contains two... Yeah, it's gone. ...Cadmen. I don't want to drink more than one

2313
07:40:34,720 --> 07:40:38,400
Coke a day. They are suffering from the cold. I drink like a Coke maybe in a couple days. I don't

2314
07:40:38,400 --> 07:40:40,159
want to drink my fucking soda every day. Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more

2315
07:40:40,159 --> 07:40:53,099
comfortable level. So let us head over to the tank. I love how you're on a PST schedule. I

2316
07:40:53,099 --> 07:40:56,459
appreciate seeing more of you every night. His streams have definitely been longer.

2317
07:40:57,180 --> 07:41:18,450
You're looking extra bald today. I will 1v1 you in auto chess and just show you up. And I

2318
07:41:18,450 --> 07:41:39,759
ain't even ever played it. Have they grown? Not really. Hey. Oh goody. God, they're so ugly.

2319
07:41:41,810 --> 07:41:47,169
All of all three of us or just them two? You got to clarify that. After all this bullshit

2320
07:41:47,169 --> 07:42:07,009
that lasts like 20 minutes. Oh goody. It's about time. Thanks. I believe I'm beginning to... Oh

2321
07:42:07,009 --> 07:42:13,490
jeez. See what happens when you put a... What secrets of the universe are we going to get

2322
07:42:14,049 --> 07:42:32,259
after completing this finally? What was that? Oh, two hatchlings. I'll take them. I'll take

2323
07:42:32,259 --> 07:42:54,290
you, please. Hello. Oh, why did... The face is just so fucked up. They lift their heads up and

2324
07:42:54,290 --> 07:43:04,130
they just look so terrifying. Okay. Coming out on land now. They can come out on land.

2325
07:43:05,009 --> 07:43:24,720
That's new. Talk to me. Let's get some more info. Hi. Let's talk. Hello. Who listening?

2326
07:43:26,349 --> 07:43:45,119
It's good to see you again. You can like Dead Space 2 on me here. Hello. Hello. Let's talk.

2327
07:43:48,959 --> 07:43:55,279
Hey, I have something I want to talk to you about. Okay. You know, I'm really getting the

2328
07:43:55,279 --> 07:44:02,000
impression that you people are busy all the time. Maybe it's just here in America, which is such a

2329
07:44:02,000 --> 07:44:08,799
business obsessed culture. It seems like everyone is always complaining about not having any spare

2330
07:44:08,880 --> 07:44:14,240
time, but when they get some, they don't know what to do with it because they're so used to being

2331
07:44:14,240 --> 07:44:20,639
busy. Okay. It's strange that knowing how to relax appears to have become a skill you humans

2332
07:44:20,639 --> 07:44:28,479
have to learn. You seem to know how to relax if you're talking to me, but I want to know what

2333
07:44:28,479 --> 07:44:34,479
else you do in your spare time. For example, what do you do when you're with your friends?

2334
07:44:35,360 --> 07:44:50,700
The same thing. Play video games. When I ask you something, I expect an answer. You know,

2335
07:44:50,700 --> 07:44:57,099
let us revisit my last inquiry to you. That is, if you can cooperate this time.

2336
07:44:58,700 --> 07:45:09,599
For example, what do you do when you're with your friends? Play video games. Hold on. I've

2337
07:45:10,560 --> 07:45:37,409
got the worst gas. Give me a second. What? Hello? Is he all right? Are you okay? Are you okay?

2338
07:45:45,599 --> 07:45:59,200
Hello? Yeah. Hello. Are you okay? Let me repeat the question. I said, Hey, I have something I want to

2339
07:45:59,200 --> 07:46:06,080
talk to you about. You know, I'm really getting the impression that you people are busy all the

2340
07:46:06,080 --> 07:46:13,680
time. Maybe it's just here in America, which is such a business obsessed culture. It seems like

2341
07:46:13,680 --> 07:46:19,840
everyone is always complaining about not having any spare time, but when they get some, they don't

2342
07:46:19,840 --> 07:46:25,840
know what to do with it because they're so used to being busy. It's strange that knowing how to

2343
07:46:25,840 --> 07:46:33,490
relax appears to have become a skill you humans have to learn. You seem to know how to relax if

2344
07:46:33,490 --> 07:46:39,810
you're talking to me, but I want to know what else you do in your spare time. For example,

2345
07:46:40,610 --> 07:46:47,970
what do you do when you're with your friends? Play video games. Like to toss a few back with

2346
07:46:47,970 --> 07:46:53,650
friends, huh? Yeah. I guess I don't really understand why you humans are so interested

2347
07:46:53,650 --> 07:46:59,810
in destroying your precious brain cells. Just out of curiosity, why do you like to drink?

2348
07:47:01,090 --> 07:47:11,900
Because it's fun. I see. Then the fun starts during the prolonged vomiting into a garbage can.

2349
07:47:13,099 --> 07:47:22,619
You're implying that I drink or drink like 15 beers when I drink. No, you drink a few drinks.

2350
07:47:23,259 --> 07:47:27,099
You have some fun conversation. Maybe you do something fun and that's it.

2351
07:47:28,060 --> 07:47:34,540
Why would you say, okay, yeah, I like to drink. I like to go and have a few drinks with friends.

2352
07:47:34,540 --> 07:47:42,400
It's fun. You're puking. Where did you get the... I don't know where you got that from. Talk to me.

2353
07:47:47,630 --> 07:47:53,470
So I think I have an idea of what activities you and your friends do in your time together.

2354
07:47:54,270 --> 07:48:01,659
Do you see a lot of them, by the way? Not anymore. He's moving. I'm gonna say yes, though.

2355
07:48:01,659 --> 07:48:07,419
Yes. So I see him. Well, that's good. I wouldn't want my little biped to get lonely.

2356
07:48:11,340 --> 07:48:22,689
Talk to me. You know what I've noticed? People love to talk. Oh, sure. There are quiet ones every

2357
07:48:22,689 --> 07:48:28,849
once in a while, but usually if you ask a person the right questions, they can go on for hours.

2358
07:48:29,569 --> 07:48:35,409
I mean, why else would you have me around if you didn't like a good conversation every once in a

2359
07:48:35,409 --> 07:48:42,450
while? I think that's also what makes a good friend. If they're willing to listen to you spout

2360
07:48:42,450 --> 07:48:49,330
off about something, you just have to make sure you let them talk once in a while too so you don't

2361
07:48:49,330 --> 07:48:56,369
bore them to death. But I was wondering what kinds of things do you and your friends talk about?

2362
07:48:57,169 --> 07:49:14,000
TV? I don't know. I don't know. Anything. It could be anything. I don't know what many of my friends talk about.

2363
07:49:14,000 --> 07:49:18,000
It's not like one topic we always discuss.

2364
07:49:18,000 --> 07:49:20,000
Can you give me the answer, please?

2365
07:49:20,000 --> 07:49:22,000
Nobody just talked about one topic.

2366
07:49:22,000 --> 07:49:26,000
You've forgotten, haven't you?

2367
07:49:27,389 --> 07:49:36,349
Okay, then again. But I was wondering what kinds of things do you and your friends talk about?

2368
07:49:38,099 --> 07:49:46,509
Food. Oh, you movie buffs. That's great that you can share a common interest like that, though.

2369
07:49:47,470 --> 07:49:53,630
Movie buffs are a lot like literary buffs. They like to pick apart the things they love and get

2370
07:49:53,630 --> 07:49:59,709
as much out of them as possible. The only drawback is it might be harder to appreciate these things

2371
07:49:59,709 --> 07:50:07,069
once you start dissecting them. I'm sure you know all about that, though. I say you can never really

2372
07:50:07,069 --> 07:50:14,830
get bored if you have someone around who you can talk to. Sometimes it's more fun to just sit around

2373
07:50:14,830 --> 07:50:21,069
and talk than it is to actually go do something. It all depends on the person, though.

2374
07:50:21,389 --> 07:50:26,060
Talk to me.

2375
07:50:26,060 --> 07:50:41,869
Say, I know you spend time socializing with your friends a lot, but you have to have some time left over to spend with your sweetheart, right?

2376
07:50:41,869 --> 07:50:49,869
It's good to be in a relationship that's a friendship, also. You can kill two birds with one stone.

2377
07:50:49,869 --> 07:50:55,869
Besides, I don't know why you'd want to be with someone who bores the pants off you.

2378
07:50:56,750 --> 07:51:14,319
So what do you and your girlfriend like to do together? You know what? Seaman doesn't want to know this.

2379
07:51:14,319 --> 07:51:21,200
Just keep it to yourself. Well, I'm sure you and your sweetie care about each other, but if you don't mind

2380
07:51:21,200 --> 07:51:28,159
me saying so, I think you may have worked yourself into some kind of rut. Maybe you should think about

2381
07:51:28,319 --> 07:51:36,319
getting out more. Exploring your world, that sort of thing. Who knows? Maybe you don't need anything except each other.

2382
07:51:36,319 --> 07:51:38,319
Go jogging!

2383
07:51:38,319 --> 07:51:42,319
Nah, get out and do something before you drive each other crazy.

2384
07:51:42,319 --> 07:51:44,689
Why are you playing facade? This is the original facade.

2385
07:51:44,689 --> 07:51:49,360
Alright, how's the tank?

2386
07:51:49,360 --> 07:51:59,540
One of them's dying.

2387
07:51:59,540 --> 07:52:21,599
Question is who?

2388
07:52:21,599 --> 07:52:23,599
Why am I so slow to respond?

2389
07:52:23,599 --> 07:52:37,939
What do you mean slow to respond?

2390
07:52:38,099 --> 07:52:41,169
What are you guys doing?

2391
07:52:41,169 --> 07:52:45,250
Yes?

2392
07:52:45,250 --> 07:52:47,250
What are you two doing?

2393
07:52:47,250 --> 07:52:49,250
You know what the really great thing about friends is?

2394
07:52:49,250 --> 07:52:51,250
And movies and TV shows.

2395
07:52:51,250 --> 07:52:53,250
Spending time with them makes you really appreciate the time you spend by yourself.

2396
07:52:53,250 --> 07:52:55,250
And books.

2397
07:52:55,250 --> 07:52:59,250
I mean, you probably get tired of your friends sometimes, don't you?

2398
07:52:59,250 --> 07:53:01,250
What do you like to do when you're by yourself?

2399
07:53:01,250 --> 07:53:09,060
Sleep.

2400
07:53:09,060 --> 07:53:14,299
Wow. You sound like you're a thrill a minute.

2401
07:53:14,299 --> 07:53:16,299
It's good that you don't mind being by yourself.

2402
07:53:16,459 --> 07:53:22,459
It seems like a lot of people can't stand it because then they actually have to think.

2403
07:53:22,459 --> 07:53:26,459
I see you don't have that problem.

2404
07:53:26,459 --> 07:53:29,279
What is this guy doing right now?

2405
07:53:29,279 --> 07:53:33,569
This one's freaking me out.

2406
07:53:33,569 --> 07:53:39,069
You guys are just too close. Move out of the way.

2407
07:53:39,069 --> 07:53:41,069
Alright, how are we doing over here?

2408
07:53:41,069 --> 07:53:52,450
We look alright.

2409
07:53:52,450 --> 07:53:55,900
Got a couple more eggs.

2410
07:53:55,900 --> 07:53:57,900
Another day?

2411
07:53:57,900 --> 07:54:01,619
Would you like to s-

2412
07:54:01,619 --> 07:54:25,470
What's the goal of this game?

2413
07:54:25,630 --> 07:54:28,380
What's the goal of this game?

2414
07:54:28,380 --> 07:54:34,380
To raise a tadpole into a frog who eventually implants chips into all humans' brains.

2415
07:54:34,380 --> 07:54:38,880
And forces them to build the pyramids.

2416
07:54:38,880 --> 07:54:40,880
Well, sorry, the new pyramids.

2417
07:54:40,880 --> 07:54:43,439
That's all they care about.

2418
07:54:43,439 --> 07:54:58,029
Free 30.

2419
07:54:58,029 --> 07:55:00,029
20 days exactly, almost 3 weeks.

2420
07:55:00,029 --> 07:55:12,720
This is a lot of passive-aggressive mannerisms to deal with in one night.

2421
07:55:12,720 --> 07:55:19,119
That's the designer's face in the game.

2422
07:55:19,119 --> 07:55:23,919
That's actually-

2423
07:55:24,080 --> 07:55:26,639
That's really funny.

2424
07:55:26,639 --> 07:55:41,169
Good evening. Welcome to the laboratory of Jean Paul Gusset.

2425
07:55:41,169 --> 07:55:44,369
Any changes, Leonard?

2426
07:55:44,369 --> 07:55:46,369
Greetings, and welcome back.

2427
07:55:46,369 --> 07:55:48,369
You're doing a good job.

2428
07:55:48,369 --> 07:55:53,169
Let's see.

2429
07:55:53,169 --> 07:55:59,169
Last time, the tadmen are now closer in appearance to frogs rather than tadpoles.

2430
07:55:59,169 --> 07:56:01,169
Let us then call them frogmen.

2431
07:56:01,169 --> 07:56:03,169
Frogmen.

2432
07:56:03,169 --> 07:56:06,110
That's actually awesome.

2433
07:56:06,110 --> 07:56:08,110
Frogmen.

2434
07:56:08,270 --> 07:56:10,270
To frogmen.

2435
07:56:10,270 --> 07:56:12,270
To frogmen.

2436
07:56:12,270 --> 07:56:15,599
They are suffering from the cold.

2437
07:56:15,599 --> 07:56:19,599
Please use the heater to raise the temperatures to a more comfortable room.

2438
07:56:19,599 --> 07:56:21,599
So what, um...

2439
07:56:21,599 --> 07:56:23,599
What's the final evolution then?

2440
07:56:27,700 --> 07:56:29,700
Do they go from frogmen to lizards?

2441
07:56:29,700 --> 07:56:31,700
What do they go into?

2442
07:56:31,700 --> 07:56:36,299
Birds?

2443
07:56:36,299 --> 07:56:40,340
They don't turn into humans. No, they don't.

2444
07:56:40,340 --> 07:56:46,990
They turn into birds.

2445
07:56:46,990 --> 07:56:50,700
Tadpole, frog, eagle.

2446
07:56:50,860 --> 07:57:03,069
Turn up the heat.

2447
07:57:03,069 --> 07:57:05,700
Oh, goody.

2448
07:57:05,700 --> 07:57:20,860
I'm feeling a little peckish.

2449
07:57:20,860 --> 07:57:22,860
Would you feed me?

2450
07:57:22,860 --> 07:57:24,860
Now they want to eat.

2451
07:57:24,860 --> 07:57:26,860
Okay, I got plenty of food.

2452
07:57:26,860 --> 07:57:30,619
I actually have food for the next at least 10 days.

2453
07:57:30,619 --> 07:57:32,619
This will be good.

2454
07:57:32,619 --> 07:57:35,689
You eat this shit, right?

2455
07:57:35,689 --> 07:57:37,930
What if they didn't eat these anymore?

2456
07:57:37,930 --> 07:57:40,549
Someone over here wants to eat.

2457
07:57:40,549 --> 07:57:42,549
There you go.

2458
07:57:42,549 --> 07:57:58,220
Go get it.

2459
07:57:58,220 --> 07:58:03,849
They don't eat these.

2460
07:58:04,009 --> 07:58:08,310
I'd offer you some, but that would mean less for me.

2461
07:58:08,310 --> 07:58:11,959
They eat the moths.

2462
07:58:11,959 --> 07:58:13,959
No, they don't. He's going over there right now.

2463
07:58:13,959 --> 07:58:18,819
Okay.

2464
07:58:18,819 --> 07:58:21,700
Good.

2465
07:58:21,700 --> 07:58:23,700
That was a Campbell's soup reference.

2466
07:58:23,700 --> 07:58:27,580
I think I need some food.

2467
07:58:27,580 --> 07:58:30,580
Instead of one bite, they take a whole thing.

2468
07:58:30,580 --> 07:58:35,259
So.

2469
07:58:35,259 --> 07:58:37,259
Hello. Hello.

2470
07:58:37,259 --> 07:58:39,259
Are you listening?

2471
07:58:39,259 --> 07:58:46,040
I am. How are you?

2472
07:58:46,200 --> 07:58:53,479
Have any questions?

2473
07:58:53,479 --> 07:59:00,200
Bonjour.

2474
07:59:00,200 --> 07:59:06,150
Talk to me.

2475
07:59:06,150 --> 07:59:13,150
One thing I find really interesting about people is how very chameleon-like many of you can be.

2476
07:59:13,150 --> 07:59:19,150
For example, when a person is talking to their closest friends as opposed to their employer,

2477
07:59:19,150 --> 07:59:22,150
their entire persona will often change.

2478
07:59:22,150 --> 07:59:24,150
Of course, it really depends on the person.

2479
07:59:24,150 --> 07:59:26,150
You don't want to get fired.

2480
07:59:26,310 --> 07:59:30,310
You seem to do different things around people than when you're by yourself,

2481
07:59:30,310 --> 07:59:35,310
and that leads me to ask you, depending on who you're with,

2482
07:59:35,310 --> 07:59:39,310
do you think your personality changes a lot?

2483
07:59:39,310 --> 07:59:41,310
A little or not at all?

2484
07:59:41,310 --> 07:59:43,310
A little.

2485
07:59:43,310 --> 07:59:45,310
I think that's pretty common.

2486
07:59:45,310 --> 07:59:48,310
People adapt to the situations around them.

2487
07:59:48,310 --> 07:59:50,310
I'm not going to say the F-word.

2488
07:59:50,310 --> 07:59:55,310
Often, the way you act around your grocery store clerk won't necessitate quite as much ass kissing

2489
07:59:55,470 --> 07:59:57,470
when you're around people you owe money to.

2490
07:59:57,470 --> 08:00:04,470
The things you do with different people and when you're alone reflect your personality changes, I think.

2491
08:00:04,470 --> 08:00:08,470
I mean, it seems like there's a lot of things going on with you.

2492
08:00:08,470 --> 08:00:12,470
No wonder you act differently around different people.

2493
08:00:12,470 --> 08:00:16,470
It seems like you're doing lots of different things around them, too.

2494
08:00:16,470 --> 08:00:23,470
Well, I think I know you well enough to tell you that even I act differently depending on who I'm with,

2495
08:00:23,630 --> 08:00:25,630
and it makes sense.

2496
08:00:25,630 --> 08:00:29,630
Everyone has different expectations of everyone else,

2497
08:00:29,630 --> 08:00:32,630
and nobody expects me to pick my nose around them.

2498
08:00:32,630 --> 08:00:35,630
Yes, that is my private moment.

2499
08:00:35,630 --> 08:00:37,630
Don't tell anyone.

2500
08:00:37,630 --> 08:00:39,630
Hey, thanks for the food.

2501
08:00:39,630 --> 08:00:43,630
It gets really tough for us when the air gets too dry.

2502
08:00:43,630 --> 08:00:47,630
There should be a sprinkler that Gasset built somewhere around here.

2503
08:00:47,630 --> 08:00:51,630
Hey, can you use the D-pad to look for it?

2504
08:00:51,790 --> 08:00:55,790
Come on, use the D-pad and find the sprinkler.

2505
08:00:55,790 --> 08:00:57,790
I'm using the D-pad? What do you mean, the sprinkler?

2506
08:00:57,790 --> 08:01:00,790
Hey, I'm trying to sleep in here.

2507
08:01:00,790 --> 08:01:11,569
There. Is that better?

2508
08:01:11,569 --> 08:01:14,569
Put the light out or I'll put yours out.

2509
08:01:14,569 --> 08:01:17,869
Jesus fucking okay. Oh my god.

2510
08:01:17,869 --> 08:01:25,619
Talk to me. Let's talk.

2511
08:01:25,619 --> 08:01:27,619
That's my name. Don't wear it out.

2512
08:01:27,619 --> 08:01:29,619
What is this? I don't even know what the name is.

2513
08:01:29,619 --> 08:01:35,040
Greg? Hey, Greg. Greg.

2514
08:01:37,419 --> 08:01:40,419
I'm coming, Your Majesty.

2515
08:01:40,419 --> 08:01:45,419
That's a terrifying image.

2516
08:01:45,419 --> 08:01:54,720
Let's talk. Talk to me.

2517
08:01:54,720 --> 08:01:58,720
It's really not a difficult question, I said.

2518
08:01:58,720 --> 08:02:02,720
One thing I find really interesting about people

2519
08:02:02,720 --> 08:02:06,720
is how very chameleon-like many of you can be.

2520
08:02:06,720 --> 08:02:10,720
For example, when a person is talking to their closest friends

2521
08:02:10,720 --> 08:02:13,720
as opposed to their employer,

2522
08:02:13,880 --> 08:02:16,880
your entire persona will often change.

2523
08:02:16,880 --> 08:02:19,880
Of course, it really depends on the person.

2524
08:02:19,880 --> 08:02:22,880
I mean, you seem to do different things around people

2525
08:02:22,880 --> 08:02:25,880
than when you're by yourself and that leads me to ask.

2526
08:02:25,880 --> 08:02:28,880
Did you know you were in the same room standing five feet away from your brother that asked that question?

2527
08:02:28,880 --> 08:02:31,880
Depending on who you're with, do you think your personality changes a lot?

2528
08:02:31,880 --> 08:02:34,880
A little or not at all?

2529
08:02:34,880 --> 08:02:38,180
A little.

2530
08:02:38,180 --> 08:02:41,180
I think that's pretty common. People adapt to the situations around them.

2531
08:02:41,340 --> 08:02:44,340
Often, the way you act around your grocery store clerk

2532
08:02:44,340 --> 08:02:47,340
won't necessitate quite as much ass-kissing

2533
08:02:47,340 --> 08:02:50,340
as when you're around people you owe money to.

2534
08:02:50,340 --> 08:02:53,340
The things you do with different people and when you're alone

2535
08:02:53,340 --> 08:02:56,340
reflect your personality changes, I think.

2536
08:02:56,340 --> 08:03:00,340
I mean, it seems like there's a lot of things going on with you.

2537
08:03:00,340 --> 08:03:04,340
No wonder you act differently around different people.

2538
08:03:04,340 --> 08:03:08,340
It seems like you're doing lots of different things around them too.

2539
08:03:08,500 --> 08:03:11,500
Well, I think I know you well enough to tell you that

2540
08:03:11,500 --> 08:03:14,500
even I act differently depending on who I'm with

2541
08:03:14,500 --> 08:03:17,500
and it makes sense.

2542
08:03:17,500 --> 08:03:20,500
Everyone has different expectations of everyone else

2543
08:03:20,500 --> 08:03:23,500
and nobody expects me to pick my nose around them.

2544
08:03:23,500 --> 08:03:26,500
Yes, that is my private moment.

2545
08:03:26,500 --> 08:03:29,500
Don't tell anyone, please.

2546
08:03:29,500 --> 08:03:32,500
Anyway, I'm going to go think about things for a while.

2547
08:03:32,500 --> 08:03:35,500
It was nice talking with you.

2548
08:03:35,659 --> 08:03:38,659
Bye.

2549
08:03:38,659 --> 08:03:41,659
Bye.

2550
08:03:41,659 --> 08:03:44,659
Why don't you go do something more intellectually stimulating

2551
08:03:44,659 --> 08:03:47,659
like eat paint chips?

2552
08:03:47,659 --> 08:03:50,659
You're dead, don't worry.

2553
08:03:50,659 --> 08:03:54,159
Talk to me. Talk to me.

2554
08:03:54,159 --> 08:04:03,209
Hey, Greg.

2555
08:04:03,209 --> 08:04:06,900
What do you need?

2556
08:04:06,900 --> 08:04:09,900
I see you out there moving from place to place

2557
08:04:10,060 --> 08:04:13,060
and sometimes I am envious of your freedom.

2558
08:04:13,060 --> 08:04:16,060
There are so many things you can do.

2559
08:04:16,060 --> 08:04:19,060
I can imagine what it must be like to be so free.

2560
08:04:19,060 --> 08:04:22,060
It's weird how familiar it seems.

2561
08:04:22,060 --> 08:04:25,060
You must get a lot of exercise

2562
08:04:25,060 --> 08:04:28,060
running around as you do.

2563
08:04:28,060 --> 08:04:31,060
So with all that moving about, do you think you're in pretty good shape?

2564
08:04:31,060 --> 08:04:34,659
No.

2565
08:04:34,659 --> 08:04:37,659
You think you're in pretty bad shape, is that right?

2566
08:04:37,819 --> 08:04:42,220
Yeah.

2567
08:04:42,220 --> 08:04:45,520
I thought you really liked your body.

2568
08:04:45,520 --> 08:04:48,520
Maybe you've just really let yourself go recently

2569
08:04:48,520 --> 08:04:51,520
or maybe you just like your body despite being out of shape.

2570
08:04:51,520 --> 08:04:54,520
I mean, it's not like round

2571
08:04:54,520 --> 08:04:57,520
is necessarily a bad shape.

2572
08:04:57,520 --> 08:05:00,520
You know, circles are round

2573
08:05:00,520 --> 08:05:03,520
and they're great.

2574
08:05:03,520 --> 08:05:06,520
It's hard to say whether or not someone is in good shape.

2575
08:05:06,680 --> 08:05:09,680
It seems like your TV and magazines

2576
08:05:09,680 --> 08:05:12,680
tell you what it means to be fit,

2577
08:05:12,680 --> 08:05:15,680
but that idea of fitness can be pretty unrealistic.

2578
08:05:15,680 --> 08:05:18,680
On the other hand, it's pretty safe to say

2579
08:05:18,680 --> 08:05:21,680
that a little physical activity will make you fitter

2580
08:05:21,680 --> 08:05:24,680
than just sitting around on your butt

2581
08:05:24,680 --> 08:05:27,680
and eating potato chips.

2582
08:05:27,680 --> 08:05:30,680
You don't seem really satisfied with your level of fitness.

2583
08:05:30,680 --> 08:05:33,680
I don't even like potato chips.

2584
08:05:33,840 --> 08:05:40,520
Talk to me.

2585
08:05:40,520 --> 08:05:48,930
What's up?

2586
08:05:48,930 --> 08:05:51,930
It seems strange to me

2587
08:05:51,930 --> 08:05:54,930
that with all the wonderful things you can do with your bodies

2588
08:05:54,930 --> 08:05:57,930
there are still people out there who are out of shape.

2589
08:05:57,930 --> 08:06:00,930
People actually have to make time in their day

2590
08:06:00,930 --> 08:06:03,930
just to exercise.

2591
08:06:03,930 --> 08:06:06,930
And when they do, they do strange useless motions

2592
08:06:06,930 --> 08:06:09,930
over and over that serve no purpose

2593
08:06:10,090 --> 08:06:13,090
to their muscles.

2594
08:06:13,090 --> 08:06:16,090
It seems like such a shame that your world doesn't naturally allow

2595
08:06:16,090 --> 08:06:19,090
for more physical activity.

2596
08:06:19,090 --> 08:06:22,090
You think you're in pretty bad shape, huh?

2597
08:06:22,090 --> 08:06:25,090
Well, what are you doing to get in better shape?

2598
08:06:25,090 --> 08:06:28,520
Nothing.

2599
08:06:28,520 --> 08:06:31,700
Nothing? Really?

2600
08:06:31,700 --> 08:06:34,700
Yeah.

2601
08:06:34,700 --> 08:06:37,700
So I guess you must not really care

2602
08:06:37,860 --> 08:06:40,860
because you seem to be a classic case of cause and effect.

2603
08:06:40,860 --> 08:06:43,860
No exercise, no fitness.

2604
08:06:43,860 --> 08:06:46,860
Who knows?

2605
08:06:46,860 --> 08:06:49,860
Maybe you have a perfect body and are just completely delusional

2606
08:06:49,860 --> 08:06:52,860
but something tells me that if you exercised a little

2607
08:06:52,860 --> 08:06:55,860
you might feel better about yourself.

2608
08:06:55,860 --> 08:06:58,860
I guess I'll have to keep asking you questions

2609
08:06:58,860 --> 08:07:01,860
and see what else I can find out about you.

2610
08:07:01,860 --> 08:07:07,720
Hmm. Number one?

2611
08:07:07,880 --> 08:07:10,880
No, no. It's definitely number two.

2612
08:07:12,880 --> 08:07:18,810
All right. Time for the final day.

2613
08:07:18,810 --> 08:07:27,279
Good night.

2614
08:07:27,279 --> 08:07:36,409
Roast this smug asshole?

2615
08:07:36,409 --> 08:07:40,220
I need to see the final thing.

2616
08:07:40,220 --> 08:07:46,790
We're almost at one of the last...

2617
08:07:46,790 --> 08:07:50,479
There's apparently only two question sets left

2618
08:07:50,479 --> 08:07:53,979
and that's it.

2619
08:07:53,979 --> 08:07:56,979
I'm going to be the only person who's ever beaten

2620
08:07:57,139 --> 08:08:00,139
Seaman on stream.

2621
08:08:00,139 --> 08:08:03,139
On original console, no save stating,

2622
08:08:03,139 --> 08:08:06,139
no fast forwards, no, no.

2623
08:08:06,139 --> 08:08:09,139
Only person on Twitch to have beat it

2624
08:08:09,139 --> 08:08:23,110
with real original hardware on stream.

2625
08:08:23,110 --> 08:08:28,400
I got original shit here.

2626
08:08:28,400 --> 08:08:46,939
Oh, fast, right.

2627
08:08:46,939 --> 08:08:50,240
Would you like to save and end the session?

2628
08:08:50,240 --> 08:08:53,240
You know what I mean though.

2629
08:08:53,400 --> 08:09:19,860
Only goddamn person on this whole site.

2630
08:09:19,860 --> 08:09:23,669
Only fucking person on this site

2631
08:09:23,669 --> 08:09:27,419
that probably owns one of these.

2632
08:09:27,419 --> 08:09:31,819
I might be the only person on the internet

2633
08:09:31,819 --> 08:09:38,500
that still has one. Do you have one?

2634
08:09:38,500 --> 08:09:45,369
You got one of these? With original microphone?

2635
08:09:45,369 --> 08:09:48,369
That was probably up somebody's ass?

2636
08:09:48,369 --> 08:09:51,860
By the way, isn't this supposed to have a thing up here?

2637
08:09:51,860 --> 08:09:56,189
It's supposed to be a little puffball.

2638
08:09:56,349 --> 08:10:01,380
Welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul Gasset.

2639
08:10:01,380 --> 08:10:04,380
Greetings and welcome back.

2640
08:10:04,380 --> 08:10:10,060
You're doing a good job. Very well.

2641
08:10:10,060 --> 08:10:13,060
Ah, you can now use the sprinkler.

2642
08:10:13,060 --> 08:10:16,060
Frogman is sensitive to dryness

2643
08:10:16,060 --> 08:10:20,259
so you must use the sprinkler frequently.

2644
08:10:20,259 --> 08:10:23,259
Is this for PS4? It is not.

2645
08:10:23,259 --> 08:10:26,259
At the moment, the habitat contains

2646
08:10:26,259 --> 08:10:30,970
two frogmen.

2647
08:10:31,130 --> 08:10:34,299
Please use the heater to raise the temperature

2648
08:10:34,299 --> 08:10:37,299
to a more comfortable level.

2649
08:10:37,299 --> 08:10:41,439
So let us head over to the tank.

2650
08:10:41,439 --> 08:10:44,869
Yeah, I'm missing the puffball.

2651
08:10:44,869 --> 08:10:47,869
I'm so ashamed that I put this thing in my mouth

2652
08:10:47,869 --> 08:10:57,619
and pretend up my nose.

2653
08:10:57,619 --> 08:11:00,619
We're in the final set of questions.

2654
08:11:00,619 --> 08:11:04,759
Somebody said three and a half K viewers

2655
08:11:04,759 --> 08:11:08,380
at midnight PST.

2656
08:11:08,540 --> 08:11:11,979
But you're seeing it through like I am.

2657
08:11:11,979 --> 08:11:26,450
Hey, thanks for sticking around.

2658
08:11:26,450 --> 08:11:29,450
Can someone out there put on a sprinkler for me?

2659
08:11:29,450 --> 08:11:32,450
There's not enough moisture here.

2660
08:11:32,450 --> 08:11:35,450
I need a little mist here. It's too dry.

2661
08:11:35,450 --> 08:11:38,450
How about turning up the heat?

2662
08:11:38,450 --> 08:11:41,750
Give me something to eat.

2663
08:11:41,750 --> 08:11:47,680
Turn the heat up. Give me something to eat.

2664
08:11:47,680 --> 08:11:50,680
Mist my body.

2665
08:11:50,840 --> 08:11:58,479
Yes, my prince. Anything for you, my prince.

2666
08:11:58,479 --> 08:12:01,659
Hey, can you give me something to eat?

2667
08:12:01,659 --> 08:12:04,659
Could you put the heater on for me?

2668
08:12:04,659 --> 08:12:07,900
You know those things each take time.

2669
08:12:07,900 --> 08:12:12,529
More than ten seconds.

2670
08:12:12,529 --> 08:12:16,599
Could you put the heater on for me?

2671
08:12:16,599 --> 08:12:19,599
I'm really hungry. Please feed me.

2672
08:12:19,599 --> 08:12:23,479
I'm kind of hungry.

2673
08:12:23,479 --> 08:12:26,479
I sure could go for a bite to eat.

2674
08:12:26,639 --> 08:12:34,360
Let's get some food in here.

2675
08:12:34,360 --> 08:12:39,650
I command you to feed me.

2676
08:12:39,650 --> 08:12:42,650
It's like manna from heaven.

2677
08:12:42,650 --> 08:12:54,770
You're such a little dick.

2678
08:12:54,770 --> 08:13:04,279
Imagine being commanded to feed somebody.

2679
08:13:04,279 --> 08:13:07,459
I command you to feed me.

2680
08:13:07,459 --> 08:13:11,139
Hey, thanks for the food.

2681
08:13:11,139 --> 08:13:20,000
Why not?

2682
08:13:20,000 --> 08:13:24,389
So full.

2683
08:13:24,549 --> 08:13:27,790
Oh, fuck it. Who cares?

2684
08:13:27,790 --> 08:13:32,500
We have so much food and we're done.

2685
08:13:32,500 --> 08:13:37,599
I need to bring this over though.

2686
08:13:37,599 --> 08:13:48,889
Why can't I pick anything up?

2687
08:13:48,889 --> 08:13:54,560
Why don't you go rustle me up some grub?

2688
08:13:54,560 --> 08:13:57,930
Can the frog eat?

2689
08:13:57,930 --> 08:14:00,930
The frog, I think, if it eats the spider, will get sick.

2690
08:14:00,930 --> 08:14:12,659
Food over here? Kill the spider.

2691
08:14:12,659 --> 08:14:15,970
I can't. Well, now I can. If he eats, I can kill the spider.

2692
08:14:16,130 --> 08:14:22,680
Right there. Eat it. Eat that bug.

2693
08:14:22,680 --> 08:14:27,180
Hey, you.

2694
08:14:27,180 --> 08:14:31,880
You talking to me or talking to him?

2695
08:14:31,880 --> 08:14:37,340
What do you want? Hi.

2696
08:14:37,340 --> 08:14:42,060
Don't you ever go out on the weekend?

2697
08:14:42,060 --> 08:14:45,060
Hey, thanks.

2698
08:14:45,060 --> 08:14:53,479
That hit the spot.

2699
08:14:53,479 --> 08:15:02,860
They won't eat this, right?

2700
08:15:02,860 --> 08:15:10,259
They shouldn't.

2701
08:15:10,419 --> 08:15:23,569
Talk to me.

2702
08:15:23,569 --> 08:15:38,900
Oh, what are you doing?

2703
08:15:38,900 --> 08:15:41,900
Why did you eat that?

2704
08:15:41,900 --> 08:15:47,380
Did they have to procreate?

2705
08:15:47,380 --> 08:15:51,580
He already ate.

2706
08:15:51,580 --> 08:16:00,520
If they eat, they won't eat it and he'll die.

2707
08:16:00,520 --> 08:16:05,540
I love you.

2708
08:16:05,540 --> 08:16:08,540
I love you.

2709
08:16:08,540 --> 08:16:12,419
I love you.

2710
08:16:12,580 --> 08:16:15,580
I'm going to lose my lunch, if you know what I mean.

2711
08:16:15,580 --> 08:16:19,439
I love you.

2712
08:16:19,439 --> 08:16:22,439
I'm illin'.

2713
08:16:22,439 --> 08:16:25,869
Yes, I am.

2714
08:16:25,869 --> 08:16:28,869
I'm really not feeling good.

2715
08:16:28,869 --> 08:16:32,240
I love you.

2716
08:16:32,240 --> 08:16:35,860
I love you.

2717
08:16:35,860 --> 08:16:42,500
All we need is one.

2718
08:16:42,500 --> 08:16:48,470
Talk to me. Let's talk.

2719
08:16:48,470 --> 08:16:51,779
You know, I'm really fascinated

2720
08:16:51,779 --> 08:16:54,779
by health clubs and gyms,

2721
08:16:54,779 --> 08:16:57,779
these huge places full of fancy equipment

2722
08:16:57,779 --> 08:17:00,779
and open spaces where you can run around.

2723
08:17:00,779 --> 08:17:03,779
And you have to actually pay to belong to one

2724
08:17:03,779 --> 08:17:06,779
when in the past you could just pick any field

2725
08:17:06,779 --> 08:17:09,779
and run around in it to your heart's content.

2726
08:17:09,779 --> 08:17:12,779
Or you'd get so muscular

2727
08:17:12,779 --> 08:17:15,779
and fit from all the manual labor you'd have to do

2728
08:17:15,779 --> 08:17:18,779
you wouldn't need a special place and time

2729
08:17:18,779 --> 08:17:21,779
just to exercise.

2730
08:17:21,779 --> 08:17:24,779
But I guess the world you live in gives you no other choice.

2731
08:17:24,779 --> 08:17:27,779
So tell me, do you belong to a health club?

2732
08:17:27,779 --> 08:17:30,950
That has to be what's going on.

2733
08:17:30,950 --> 08:17:34,130
No.

2734
08:17:34,130 --> 08:17:37,130
So even though you know you could be more fit,

2735
08:17:37,130 --> 08:17:40,130
you don't want to take the plunge and join a gym?

2736
08:17:40,130 --> 08:17:43,130
It might help, although I guess I can see your hesitation.

2737
08:17:43,130 --> 08:17:46,130
They offer a lot of different activities

2738
08:17:46,130 --> 08:17:49,130
in one convenient place,

2739
08:17:49,130 --> 08:17:52,130
but I just can't help but think a human being

2740
08:17:52,130 --> 08:17:55,130
might want to do something more natural,

2741
08:17:55,130 --> 08:17:58,130
like play a sport or even jog outside

2742
08:17:58,130 --> 08:18:01,130
than be cooped up in a stinky gymnasium

2743
08:18:01,130 --> 08:18:04,130
with a bunch of machines.

2744
08:18:04,130 --> 08:18:07,130
I like to hit the balls in the cages.

2745
08:18:07,130 --> 08:18:10,130
I like to work out nowadays when I haven't done it in about a year.

2746
08:18:10,130 --> 08:18:18,619
Let's talk.

2747
08:18:18,619 --> 08:18:21,619
It seems like there are a lot of different things to keep in mind

2748
08:18:21,619 --> 08:18:24,619
when you're trying to stay in shape.

2749
08:18:24,619 --> 08:18:27,619
Exercising is one of them,

2750
08:18:27,619 --> 08:18:30,619
but eating right is also very important,

2751
08:18:30,619 --> 08:18:33,619
especially where you live.

2752
08:18:33,619 --> 08:18:36,619
There's no shortage of food here, well, for most people,

2753
08:18:36,619 --> 08:18:39,619
and it's very easy to eat too much of the wrong thing, it seems.

2754
08:18:39,619 --> 08:18:42,619
No wonder so many people have problems with their weight.

2755
08:18:42,619 --> 08:18:45,619
Would you say that for the most part

2756
08:18:45,619 --> 08:18:48,619
you eat a pretty healthy diet?

2757
08:18:48,619 --> 08:18:51,919
Yes.

2758
08:18:51,919 --> 08:18:55,290
You do eat healthy? Yes.

2759
08:18:55,290 --> 08:18:58,290
You must really chow down on the vegetables, then.

2760
08:18:58,290 --> 08:19:01,290
What's your favorite one?

2761
08:19:01,290 --> 08:19:04,290
Uh, probably carrots. Carrots.

2762
08:19:04,290 --> 08:19:07,720
Carrots, huh?

2763
08:19:07,720 --> 08:19:10,720
Good as a vegetable, even better as a snowman's nose.

2764
08:19:10,720 --> 08:19:13,720
So versatile.

2765
08:19:13,720 --> 08:19:16,720
It's a shame that the things that are good for you

2766
08:19:16,720 --> 08:19:19,720
don't usually taste as good as the bad ones.

2767
08:19:19,720 --> 08:19:22,720
And you know what? The junk food marketers know it.

2768
08:19:22,720 --> 08:19:25,720
So my advice is, beat the system.

2769
08:19:25,720 --> 08:19:28,720
Eat a pound of broccoli.

2770
08:19:28,720 --> 08:19:34,580
I was pressed for time, and I had to do it.

2771
08:19:34,580 --> 08:19:39,549
I was pressed for time.

2772
08:19:39,549 --> 08:19:42,549
Drinking a fucking coke and eating a whole pizza.

2773
08:19:43,549 --> 08:19:47,479
Let's talk.

2774
08:19:47,479 --> 08:19:55,330
Is he dead yet? Oh, he's getting so red.

2775
08:19:55,330 --> 08:19:58,630
Oh, God.

2776
08:19:58,630 --> 08:20:03,259
This is actually really sad.

2777
08:20:03,259 --> 08:20:08,020
I love you. I love you.

2778
08:20:08,020 --> 08:20:11,020
I'm illin'. Yes, I am.

2779
08:20:11,020 --> 08:20:15,270
Get well soon.

2780
08:20:15,270 --> 08:20:18,270
Ooh, I think I'm going to lose my lunch

2781
08:20:18,270 --> 08:20:21,270
if you know what I mean.

2782
08:20:21,270 --> 08:20:25,709
I love you.

2783
08:20:25,709 --> 08:20:28,889
I'm illin'. Yes, I am.

2784
08:20:28,889 --> 08:20:33,090
Feel better. Feel better.

2785
08:20:33,090 --> 08:20:38,299
I am not. I love you.

2786
08:20:38,299 --> 08:20:42,290
Oh, I really don't feel very well.

2787
08:20:42,290 --> 08:20:46,099
I love you.

2788
08:20:46,099 --> 08:20:49,099
I'm illin'. Yes, I am.

2789
08:20:49,099 --> 08:20:54,250
Let's talk.

2790
08:20:54,250 --> 08:21:02,349
I feel sick. Let's talk.

2791
08:21:02,349 --> 08:21:06,419
End this and go to bed? No, I can't get this far.

2792
08:21:06,419 --> 08:21:09,419
Eight and a half hours into a stream and not see the end of this.

2793
08:21:09,419 --> 08:21:15,139
Let's talk.

2794
08:21:15,139 --> 08:21:19,330
Greg. Cheerio.

2795
08:21:19,330 --> 08:21:29,590
Talk to me. Talk to me.

2796
08:21:29,590 --> 08:21:32,590
You know, I've never been to a place

2797
08:21:32,590 --> 08:21:35,590
that's as diet-obsessed as America.

2798
08:21:35,590 --> 08:21:38,590
It seems like nobody wants to stay healthy the hard way

2799
08:21:38,590 --> 08:21:41,590
to actually exercise and eat right.

2800
08:21:41,590 --> 08:21:44,590
Instead, people are always looking

2801
08:21:44,590 --> 08:21:47,590
for a quick and easy way to lose a bunch of weight

2802
08:21:47,590 --> 08:21:50,590
as if they're just automatically going to stay healthy

2803
08:21:50,590 --> 08:21:53,590
after the diet is over. Right.

2804
08:21:53,590 --> 08:21:56,590
It looks like you take pretty regular care of yourself anyway,

2805
08:21:56,590 --> 08:21:59,590
but have you ever been on a diet?

2806
08:21:59,590 --> 08:22:03,020
Wait, hold on, that's... No.

2807
08:22:03,020 --> 08:22:06,020
Not in that context. Maybe that's for the best.

2808
08:22:06,020 --> 08:22:09,580
It looks like you're already trying to straighten out your health

2809
08:22:09,580 --> 08:22:12,580
without resorting to lose-weight quick-skis.

2810
08:22:12,580 --> 08:22:20,459
No. Talk to me.

2811
08:22:20,459 --> 08:22:23,459
I was thinking earlier about how interested

2812
08:22:23,459 --> 08:22:26,459
your culture is in sports.

2813
08:22:26,459 --> 08:22:29,459
I would say even obsessed sometimes.

2814
08:22:29,459 --> 08:22:32,459
It can really get out of hand,

2815
08:22:32,459 --> 08:22:35,459
but now that we're talking about health and staying fit,

2816
08:22:35,459 --> 08:22:38,459
it almost doesn't seem like such a bad thing.

2817
08:22:38,459 --> 08:22:41,459
That is, if you're actually playing a sport

2818
08:22:41,459 --> 08:22:44,459
and not sitting in front of a TV and watching someone else play it,

2819
08:22:44,459 --> 08:22:47,459
tell me, what's your favorite sport to play?

2820
08:22:47,459 --> 08:22:50,459
Tom Brady. Baseball.

2821
08:22:50,459 --> 08:22:53,770
You play baseball?

2822
08:22:53,770 --> 08:22:57,330
Yes. I bet you just like wearing

2823
08:22:57,330 --> 08:23:00,330
those tight little pants.

2824
08:23:00,330 --> 08:23:03,330
I think I understand why people want to play sports.

2825
08:23:03,330 --> 08:23:06,330
It must be fun to see

2826
08:23:06,330 --> 08:23:09,330
what you can make your body do if you just try a little,

2827
08:23:09,330 --> 08:23:12,330
and you also get to hang out with other people

2828
08:23:12,330 --> 08:23:15,330
and test your skills against theirs.

2829
08:23:15,330 --> 08:23:18,330
I guess I still think some people

2830
08:23:18,330 --> 08:23:21,330
can get too interested in sports,

2831
08:23:21,330 --> 08:23:24,330
especially if it interferes with the mental stimulation they get.

2832
08:23:24,330 --> 08:23:27,330
As with most things,

2833
08:23:27,330 --> 08:23:31,080
balance is the key.

2834
08:23:31,080 --> 08:23:34,080
What are you guys saying? There's a fly in your room

2835
08:23:34,080 --> 08:23:37,319
flying around your face? What are you talking about?

2836
08:23:41,180 --> 08:23:46,139
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

2837
08:23:46,139 --> 08:23:58,590
Did somebody just join the stream?

2838
08:23:58,590 --> 08:24:01,590
Watch out, there's a fly.

2839
08:24:01,590 --> 08:24:04,590
Here it comes.

2840
08:24:04,590 --> 08:24:07,830
Talk to me.

2841
08:24:07,830 --> 08:24:13,169
Talk to me. Let's talk.

2842
08:24:13,169 --> 08:24:17,430
Let's talk. What do you mean, here it comes?

2843
08:24:17,430 --> 08:24:25,069
Here it comes. You just throw shit at me?

2844
08:24:25,069 --> 08:24:28,310
You just throw shit at my screen!

2845
08:24:28,310 --> 08:24:42,990
Get well soon.

2846
08:24:42,990 --> 08:24:46,299
I really don't feel very well.

2847
08:24:46,299 --> 08:24:49,919
Get well soon.

2848
08:24:49,919 --> 08:24:55,020
I'm illin'. Yes, I am.

2849
08:24:55,020 --> 08:24:58,939
Let's talk.

2850
08:24:58,939 --> 08:25:01,939
I really don't feel very well.

2851
08:25:01,939 --> 08:25:05,950
Greg, let's talk.

2852
08:25:05,950 --> 08:25:11,689
Fine. You're a pain in the ass. How's that?

2853
08:25:11,689 --> 08:25:16,139
Wow. Now that's dark.

2854
08:25:16,139 --> 08:25:24,549
Turn the light on.

2855
08:25:24,549 --> 08:25:28,110
Hey, turn on the light. Ah, it's too bright.

2856
08:25:28,110 --> 08:25:36,330
Talk to me.

2857
08:25:36,330 --> 08:25:39,330
I was thinking earlier about sports

2858
08:25:39,330 --> 08:25:42,330
and how popular they are here.

2859
08:25:42,330 --> 08:25:45,330
As I was saying, it would be really great

2860
08:25:45,330 --> 08:25:48,330
for the collective health of the country

2861
08:25:48,330 --> 08:25:51,330
if everyone played sports, but

2862
08:25:51,330 --> 08:25:54,500
it doesn't do so much for you to just sit and watch them.

2863
08:25:54,500 --> 08:25:57,500
I'm fascinated with watching other people play sports.

2864
08:25:57,500 --> 08:26:00,500
Being a spectator.

2865
08:26:00,500 --> 08:26:03,500
Do you follow any professional sports?

2866
08:26:03,500 --> 08:26:09,479
League of Legends.

2867
08:26:09,479 --> 08:26:12,479
Well, you're a rare specimen.

2868
08:26:12,479 --> 08:26:15,479
You play sports, but you don't follow the pros.

2869
08:26:15,479 --> 08:26:18,779
It's definitely the healthier way to go.

2870
08:26:18,779 --> 08:26:21,779
Anyhow, thanks for playing.

2871
08:26:21,779 --> 08:26:31,419
Cloud 9 will win again.

2872
08:26:31,419 --> 08:26:36,380
Talk to me. Talk to me.

2873
08:26:36,380 --> 08:26:42,819
I've been asking you a lot about your health

2874
08:26:42,819 --> 08:26:45,819
and it seems that working out

2875
08:26:45,819 --> 08:26:48,819
and eating right are two big components of it all.

2876
08:26:48,819 --> 08:26:51,819
This game is louder than your voice.

2877
08:26:51,819 --> 08:26:54,819
Oh, it's because I am leaning back and talking into this microphone.

2878
08:26:54,819 --> 08:26:57,819
But it seems that your human body

2879
08:26:57,819 --> 08:27:00,819
is still so delicate.

2880
08:27:00,819 --> 08:27:03,819
All the working out and dieting in the world

2881
08:27:03,819 --> 08:27:06,819
make sure that something won't just go wrong anyway.

2882
08:27:06,819 --> 08:27:09,819
That's where your physicians come in.

2883
08:27:09,819 --> 08:27:12,819
Do you go to the doctor regularly?

2884
08:27:12,819 --> 08:27:15,819
Literally was there like fucking

2885
08:27:15,819 --> 08:27:18,819
very, very recently, yes.

2886
08:27:18,819 --> 08:27:21,819
That's to your benefit.

2887
08:27:21,819 --> 08:27:24,819
Besides, it's another excuse to get naked.

2888
08:27:24,819 --> 08:27:27,819
My, I am behaving saucily today, aren't I?

2889
08:27:27,819 --> 08:27:30,819
Human beings are very lucky

2890
08:27:30,819 --> 08:27:33,819
to have figured out how to heal themselves

2891
08:27:33,819 --> 08:27:36,819
when they get sick.

2892
08:27:36,819 --> 08:27:39,819
No other creature can do that.

2893
08:27:39,819 --> 08:27:42,819
It's easy to take all your medical knowledge for granted,

2894
08:27:42,819 --> 08:27:45,819
but think about it.

2895
08:27:45,819 --> 08:27:48,819
If you were living even several hundred years ago,

2896
08:27:48,819 --> 08:27:51,819
you'd still be putting leeches on yourself

2897
08:27:51,819 --> 08:27:54,819
whenever you got a cold.

2898
08:27:54,819 --> 08:27:57,819
Not that leeches are such a bad thing,

2899
08:27:57,819 --> 08:28:00,819
but they're actually what I would call good medicine.

2900
08:28:00,819 --> 08:28:03,819
Anyway, I'm glad to know

2901
08:28:03,819 --> 08:28:06,819
that if something goes wrong with you,

2902
08:28:06,819 --> 08:28:12,810
there's somebody that can help you out.

2903
08:28:12,810 --> 08:28:15,810
Your brother is over there suffering.

2904
08:28:15,810 --> 08:28:21,400
I don't know what to do about him.

2905
08:28:21,400 --> 08:28:27,069
Talk to me. Talk to me.

2906
08:28:27,069 --> 08:28:30,069
Like I was saying earlier,

2907
08:28:30,069 --> 08:28:33,069
it's important to go to the doctor every once in a while,

2908
08:28:33,069 --> 08:28:36,069
because it's so easy to do,

2909
08:28:36,069 --> 08:28:39,069
since healthcare can be so expensive.

2910
08:28:39,069 --> 08:28:42,069
I'm fascinated by this idea of health insurance.

2911
08:28:42,069 --> 08:28:45,069
Well, actually, I find it a little sad.

2912
08:28:45,069 --> 08:28:48,069
You humans are so sure that someday

2913
08:28:48,069 --> 08:28:51,069
you're going to get sick that you actually

2914
08:28:51,069 --> 08:28:54,069
put money away, especially for that time.

2915
08:28:54,069 --> 08:28:57,069
There's no escaping it, I guess.

2916
08:28:57,069 --> 08:29:00,069
Do you have health insurance?

2917
08:29:00,069 --> 08:29:03,700
I see.

2918
08:29:03,700 --> 08:29:06,700
Well, if you do, I guess you might as well

2919
08:29:06,700 --> 08:29:09,700
make good use of it.

2920
08:29:09,700 --> 08:29:12,700
That didn't come out exactly right, but you know what I mean.

2921
08:29:12,700 --> 08:29:16,259
Do you get sick a lot?

2922
08:29:16,259 --> 08:29:19,259
No, but I do have a lot of health problems.

2923
08:29:19,259 --> 08:29:22,259
I don't really get a cold,

2924
08:29:22,259 --> 08:29:36,299
but I've got a shitload of health problems.

2925
08:29:36,299 --> 08:29:42,979
I think he's dead. You good?

2926
08:29:42,979 --> 08:29:46,919
Oh, I think I'm going to lose my lunch,

2927
08:29:46,919 --> 08:29:51,119
if you know what I mean.

2928
08:29:51,119 --> 08:29:54,740
Get well soon.

2929
08:29:54,740 --> 08:29:57,740
Oh, I really don't feel very well.

2930
08:29:57,740 --> 08:30:01,180
Don't come over here and eat him.

2931
08:30:01,180 --> 08:30:04,180
This is poisoned meat. Don't do it.

2932
08:30:04,180 --> 08:30:07,180
Don't stick that fucking elephant trunk

2933
08:30:07,180 --> 08:30:10,180
into this and start sucking. Don't do it.

2934
08:30:10,180 --> 08:30:18,090
Bad idea.

2935
08:30:18,090 --> 08:30:28,209
Okay, good.

2936
08:30:28,209 --> 08:30:31,580
Another day.

2937
08:30:31,580 --> 08:30:37,869
Still got plenty of food.

2938
08:30:37,869 --> 08:30:40,869
Our food supply is doing good. No more spider.

2939
08:30:40,869 --> 08:30:44,750
We should have another larva tomorrow.

2940
08:30:44,750 --> 08:31:00,459
Let's go.

2941
08:31:00,459 --> 08:31:15,340
How can I be expected to sleep when this nightmare is on?

2942
08:31:15,340 --> 08:31:22,340
One more day. Is it my bedtime yet?

2943
08:31:22,340 --> 08:31:27,250
No, I'm just going.

2944
08:31:27,250 --> 08:31:30,490
Oh, shit. We're going into April.

2945
08:31:30,490 --> 08:31:36,220
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Go back.

2946
08:31:36,220 --> 08:31:42,540
We're going into April 1st.

2947
08:31:42,540 --> 08:31:50,259
4-1-2019. That's correct, right? 31? Yeah.

2948
08:31:50,259 --> 08:32:12,729
I'm going until I see the credits.

2949
08:32:12,729 --> 08:32:18,270
He doesn't know. What?

2950
08:32:18,270 --> 08:32:21,270
No, I was explicitly told that we only had

2951
08:32:21,270 --> 08:32:36,590
a couple more sequences left.

2952
08:32:44,619 --> 08:32:49,340
At the moment, the habitat contains

2953
08:32:49,340 --> 08:32:52,639
two frogmen.

2954
08:32:52,639 --> 08:32:57,479
Seaman has become ill after eating a spider.

2955
08:32:57,479 --> 08:33:00,479
Please take good care of him.

2956
08:33:00,479 --> 08:33:03,479
Some kind words of encouragement may help him feel better.

2957
08:33:03,479 --> 08:33:06,479
So let us head over to the tank.

2958
08:33:06,479 --> 08:33:11,130
Alright, this says 25 hours,

2959
08:33:11,130 --> 08:33:15,569
but what you have to understand is

2960
08:33:15,569 --> 08:33:18,869
one person, only one person,

2961
08:33:18,869 --> 08:33:34,130
reported this.

2962
08:33:34,130 --> 08:33:37,130
So that's it.

2963
08:33:37,130 --> 08:33:43,119
One guy probably left his Dreamcast on for 10 hours.

2964
08:33:43,119 --> 08:33:46,119
He left 5 hours ago and this guy is still streaming this game.

2965
08:33:46,119 --> 08:33:55,380
Laughing my ass off.

2966
08:33:55,380 --> 08:34:03,779
So how long is the game if you cheat?

2967
08:34:03,779 --> 08:34:06,779
I have no idea.

2968
08:34:06,779 --> 08:34:09,779
Hey, why don't you turn on the sprinkler?

2969
08:34:09,779 --> 08:34:12,779
I need a little mist here. It's too dry.

2970
08:34:12,779 --> 08:34:15,779
How you doing?

2971
08:34:15,779 --> 08:34:18,779
It still looks kind of like shit.

2972
08:34:18,779 --> 08:34:26,889
It's cold in here, just like my Harlem days.

2973
08:34:26,889 --> 08:34:32,110
Thanks for the moisture.

2974
08:34:32,110 --> 08:34:43,740
See that gray square thing in the back corner?

2975
08:34:43,740 --> 08:34:46,740
That's a heater.

2976
08:34:46,740 --> 08:34:53,619
In the lore, seaman species are

2977
08:34:53,619 --> 08:34:56,619
omnipotent messengers of the gods.

2978
08:34:56,619 --> 08:34:59,619
The eggs come from Egypt, which is maybe why they have a thing

2979
08:34:59,619 --> 08:35:02,619
for the pyramids. I see.

2980
08:35:02,619 --> 08:35:05,619
Why don't you give me something to eat?

2981
08:35:05,619 --> 08:35:10,770
Do you eat if you're sick?

2982
08:35:10,770 --> 08:35:15,290
It's going to be too hot. I didn't stop the wheel fast enough.

2983
08:35:15,290 --> 08:35:19,150
Maybe I did. I did.

2984
08:35:19,150 --> 08:35:26,939
Okay, let's see. Food. How are we doing? Spiders?

2985
08:35:26,939 --> 08:35:30,180
I don't see any. There are...

2986
08:35:30,180 --> 08:35:33,180
I'm going to leave that one. That one looks cool.

2987
08:35:33,180 --> 08:35:36,740
That one's getting big and fat.

2988
08:35:36,740 --> 08:35:40,490
I need two. Come over here.

2989
08:35:40,490 --> 08:35:43,490
He can't move though. Can he not? I don't think I can

2990
08:35:43,490 --> 08:35:46,490
feed him. I can't drop it over here.

2991
08:35:46,490 --> 08:35:53,360
How is he going to get better?

2992
08:35:53,360 --> 08:35:58,779
I'd offer you some, but that would mean less for me.

2993
08:35:58,779 --> 08:36:09,939
I'm not sure I can feed this one.

2994
08:36:09,939 --> 08:36:12,939
That hit the spot. Good to hear.

2995
08:36:12,939 --> 08:36:18,139
Let's take another fresh one over there.

2996
08:36:18,139 --> 08:36:21,139
No thanks. I'm not hungry now.

2997
08:36:21,139 --> 08:36:26,159
What? Are you hungry?

2998
08:36:26,159 --> 08:36:29,159
Maybe I could eat a little antacid, but that's it.

2999
08:36:29,159 --> 08:36:32,159
I really don't know what I ate that made me this way.

3000
08:36:32,159 --> 08:36:35,400
You don't want it then?

3001
08:36:35,400 --> 08:36:43,810
Did I seriously just waste this?

3002
08:36:43,810 --> 08:36:47,990
Let's talk.

3003
08:36:47,990 --> 08:36:54,740
Greg, come here.

3004
08:36:54,740 --> 08:36:57,740
Hello? Are you listening?

3005
08:36:57,740 --> 08:37:01,099
Talk to me. Yes, let's talk.

3006
08:37:01,099 --> 08:37:09,500
Good evening. Hi.

3007
08:37:09,500 --> 08:37:12,500
Okay, I've got something to tell you.

3008
08:37:12,500 --> 08:37:15,500
See, I've been lying to you all this time.

3009
08:37:15,500 --> 08:37:18,500
I'm actually Regis Philbin and if you kiss me

3010
08:37:18,500 --> 08:37:22,060
I'll become human again and give you a million dollars.

3011
08:37:22,060 --> 08:37:25,060
April Fools.

3012
08:37:25,060 --> 08:37:28,060
You believed me, didn't you? That's why.

3013
08:37:28,060 --> 08:37:31,619
Quick. Help. There's a shark in here.

3014
08:37:31,619 --> 08:37:35,430
Help. Gotcha.

3015
08:37:35,430 --> 08:37:39,180
April Fools.

3016
08:37:39,180 --> 08:37:44,650
Pretty good. Talk to me.

3017
08:37:44,650 --> 08:37:52,110
So, we've been talking a lot about the health of your body.

3018
08:37:52,110 --> 08:37:55,110
That's of course quite important,

3019
08:37:55,110 --> 08:37:58,110
but it also helps to have a healthy mind.

3020
08:37:58,110 --> 08:38:01,110
So, to that end,

3021
08:38:01,110 --> 08:38:04,110
have you ever gone to a therapist?

3022
08:38:04,110 --> 08:38:08,040
No.

3023
08:38:08,040 --> 08:38:11,040
It seems that a lot of people think that

3024
08:38:11,040 --> 08:38:14,040
seeing their mental health through the efforts of a therapist

3025
08:38:14,040 --> 08:38:17,040
is a sign of weakness. Yet most people

3026
08:38:17,040 --> 08:38:20,040
don't see going to the doctor for a physical ailment

3027
08:38:20,040 --> 08:38:23,040
as a sign of weakness.

3028
08:38:23,040 --> 08:38:26,040
Strange how people think sometimes.

3029
08:38:26,040 --> 08:38:29,040
I hope if you ever feel you have a problem

3030
08:38:29,040 --> 08:38:32,040
you can't handle, you'll consider seeing a therapist.

3031
08:38:32,040 --> 08:38:35,040
Or you can just come talk to me.

3032
08:38:35,040 --> 08:38:38,040
At least I won't charge you.

3033
08:38:38,040 --> 08:38:41,040
Much.

3034
08:38:41,040 --> 08:38:44,040
By far the most mysterious part of your human body

3035
08:38:44,040 --> 08:38:47,040
is the brain.

3036
08:38:47,040 --> 08:38:50,040
Even your greatest scientists will freely admit

3037
08:38:50,040 --> 08:38:53,040
that they barely know anything about how it works.

3038
08:38:53,040 --> 08:38:56,040
And yet, when something is wrong in your head

3039
08:38:56,040 --> 08:38:59,040
I'll bet it hurts just as much as a wound

3040
08:38:59,040 --> 08:39:02,040
or a disease.

3041
08:39:02,040 --> 08:39:05,040
I hope you take care of your mind as well as you take care of your body.

3042
08:39:05,040 --> 08:39:08,040
Or better, since you don't seem to be too keen

3043
08:39:08,040 --> 08:39:11,040
on keeping your body tip-top.

3044
08:39:11,040 --> 08:39:20,470
Talk to me.

3045
08:39:20,470 --> 08:39:24,270
What do you want?

3046
08:39:24,270 --> 08:39:27,270
Let's talk. I feel like I've said that 5,000 times this dream.

3047
08:39:27,270 --> 08:39:32,479
Let's talk. Talk to me.

3048
08:39:32,479 --> 08:39:36,619
Yes?

3049
08:39:36,619 --> 08:39:43,490
Talk to me. Let's chat. Can we talk?

3050
08:39:43,490 --> 08:39:49,029
Well, thanks for letting me in on some of your

3051
08:39:49,029 --> 08:39:52,029
health secrets.

3052
08:39:52,029 --> 08:39:55,029
All of us animals have these fragile, organic

3053
08:39:55,029 --> 08:39:58,029
bodies that break down and cause us pain.

3054
08:39:58,029 --> 08:40:01,029
But human beings are especially fascinating

3055
08:40:01,029 --> 08:40:04,029
because they can actually prevent or cure

3056
08:40:04,029 --> 08:40:07,029
so many of the body's problems.

3057
08:40:07,029 --> 08:40:10,029
That's why I wanted to know what you do to keep yourself

3058
08:40:10,029 --> 08:40:13,029
healthy. I want to know how you humans

3059
08:40:13,029 --> 08:40:16,029
take advantage of their medical knowledge.

3060
08:40:17,029 --> 08:40:20,029
Some people take it all for granted

3061
08:40:20,029 --> 08:40:23,029
and do stupid, destructive things to their bodies

3062
08:40:23,029 --> 08:40:26,029
just because they're used to having the means to recover.

3063
08:40:26,029 --> 08:40:29,209
Well, anyway,

3064
08:40:29,209 --> 08:40:32,209
I think I'm going to go take a little rest.

3065
08:40:32,209 --> 08:40:35,209
I don't want to over-exert myself.

3066
08:40:35,209 --> 08:40:38,209
I'll talk to you later.

3067
08:40:38,209 --> 08:40:41,209
There we go. Alright.

3068
08:40:41,209 --> 08:40:44,209
Only another day or two. Maybe.

3069
08:40:44,209 --> 08:40:52,490
Let's talk. Talk to me.

3070
08:40:52,490 --> 08:41:10,580
Tomorrow. We'll talk again tomorrow.

3071
08:41:10,580 --> 08:41:14,779
Will you eat? Will you eat?

3072
08:41:14,779 --> 08:41:19,729
Please eat.

3073
08:41:19,729 --> 08:41:22,729
I think I'm going to lose my lunch, if you know what I mean.

3074
08:41:22,729 --> 08:41:27,950
Get well soon.

3075
08:41:27,950 --> 08:41:32,650
I feel sick.

3076
08:41:32,650 --> 08:41:38,700
Let's check all the bugs. Any spiders? I don't think so.

3077
08:41:38,700 --> 08:41:41,880
Yeah, fuck it. We're leaving the spiders in here.

3078
08:41:41,880 --> 08:41:46,779
I got so much food.

3079
08:41:46,779 --> 08:41:49,779
Look at this shit. I got one, two, three, four.

3080
08:41:49,779 --> 08:41:53,659
I have at least three more days' worth of food.

3081
08:41:53,659 --> 08:41:58,759
At least three or four days with food.

3082
08:41:58,759 --> 08:42:13,900
We have to talk about religion and then politics

3083
08:42:13,900 --> 08:42:19,450
and then that's it.

3084
08:42:19,450 --> 08:42:31,580
It's just Simpsons hit and run all over again.

3085
08:42:31,580 --> 08:42:38,150
Oh, God. The no-no topic.

3086
08:42:38,150 --> 08:42:56,049
I just hurt my arm.

3087
08:42:56,049 --> 08:42:59,049
What do you mean politics? Are they going to ask me how I

3088
08:42:59,049 --> 08:43:08,750
glean politically?

3089
08:43:08,750 --> 08:43:11,750
So, are you a Democrat or a Republican

3090
08:43:11,750 --> 08:43:14,990
or something else?

3091
08:43:14,990 --> 08:43:25,900
I'm just going to mute the stream. It's going to be a black screen.

3092
08:43:25,900 --> 08:43:30,290
Good evening. Welcome to the laboratory

3093
08:43:30,290 --> 08:43:35,380
of Jean Paul Gasset.

3094
08:43:35,380 --> 08:43:38,380
There is a definite pattern to your visits.

3095
08:43:38,380 --> 08:43:41,380
It appears you are a punctual person.

3096
08:43:41,380 --> 08:43:44,380
At the moment, the habitat contains

3097
08:43:44,380 --> 08:43:49,220
two frogmen.

3098
08:43:49,220 --> 08:43:52,220
Seaman has become ill after eating a spider.

3099
08:43:52,220 --> 08:43:55,220
Please take good care of him.

3100
08:43:55,220 --> 08:43:58,220
Some kind words of encouragement may help him feel better.

3101
08:43:58,220 --> 08:44:04,470
So, let us head over to the tank.

3102
08:44:04,470 --> 08:44:08,419
I'm going to give cartoon responses.

3103
08:44:08,419 --> 08:44:11,419
Do you understand? I'm going to give

3104
08:44:11,419 --> 08:44:14,720
bullshit dumb cartoon responses.

3105
08:44:14,720 --> 08:44:17,720
What do you belong to for a party?

3106
08:44:17,720 --> 08:44:20,720
I'm just going to say a mashed potato party.

3107
08:44:20,720 --> 08:44:23,720
You ain't going to get shit this stream.

3108
08:44:23,720 --> 08:44:45,759
Jerma is a communist.

3109
08:44:45,759 --> 08:44:49,000
How do you roll your eyes?

3110
08:44:49,000 --> 08:44:53,459
Can I not roll my eyes?

3111
08:44:53,459 --> 08:44:56,459
I need a little mist here. It's too dry.

3112
08:44:56,459 --> 08:44:59,459
Hey, why don't you turn on the sprinkler?

3113
08:44:59,459 --> 08:45:02,459
If I weren't in a tank, I swear there was a draft.

3114
08:45:02,459 --> 08:45:08,319
Just like my Harlem days,

3115
08:45:08,319 --> 08:45:15,020
I thought I was going to shrivel up and die.

3116
08:45:15,020 --> 08:45:26,580
I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you.

3117
08:45:26,580 --> 08:45:29,580
I love you. I love you. I love you.

3118
08:45:29,580 --> 08:45:33,060
I love you.

3119
08:45:33,060 --> 08:45:36,659
He don't care. Whatever. Fuck it.

3120
08:45:36,659 --> 08:45:39,970
Hello. Are you listening?

3121
08:45:39,970 --> 08:45:49,159
There is such a good Rick and Morty

3122
08:45:49,159 --> 08:45:52,159
bit about politics. I'm just going to say it verbatim

3123
08:45:52,159 --> 08:45:55,159
to the frogs.

3124
08:45:55,159 --> 08:45:58,849
Oh, goody.

3125
08:45:58,849 --> 08:46:01,849
Excuse me, but my stomach is empty.

3126
08:46:01,849 --> 08:46:12,830
I know you're hungry.

3127
08:46:12,830 --> 08:46:16,779
You know I could really eat.

3128
08:46:16,779 --> 08:46:25,869
I feel terrible.

3129
08:46:25,869 --> 08:46:30,580
Oh, yummy, baity goodness.

3130
08:46:30,580 --> 08:46:37,150
You're learning so many ways to say that you're hungry.

3131
08:46:37,150 --> 08:46:40,150
That was tasty.

3132
08:46:40,150 --> 08:46:46,259
What are you doing?

3133
08:46:46,259 --> 08:46:49,259
Hey, what's he doing? Is he throwing up blood?

3134
08:46:49,259 --> 08:47:16,849
You saw that, right? Thotty.

3135
08:47:16,849 --> 08:47:20,659
Don't touch him. Don't. Don't. Get away from my moth.

3136
08:47:20,659 --> 08:47:26,400
I fucking hate the spiders. I have enough food.

3137
08:47:26,400 --> 08:47:31,180
I do. How am I going to get rid of you?

3138
08:47:31,180 --> 08:47:40,610
I got. I don't think. What do I do about this?

3139
08:47:40,610 --> 08:47:44,869
I think I just. That was fucked up.

3140
08:47:44,869 --> 08:47:48,430
I don't know what to do. I cannot put the spider in the matrix

3141
08:47:48,430 --> 08:47:52,950
I can only go here or here. I'm just going to leave it.

3142
08:47:52,950 --> 08:47:57,540
Unfortunately, I got plenty of food, I think,

3143
08:47:57,540 --> 08:48:01,540
to molest to the end of the game.

3144
08:48:01,540 --> 08:48:09,119
Get both the frogs sick. No, I'm not going to do that.

3145
08:48:09,119 --> 08:48:13,380
All right, let's go. Ooh, he's not sick anymore.

3146
08:48:13,380 --> 08:48:19,569
Let's talk politics. Talk to me.

3147
08:48:19,569 --> 08:48:23,319
I feel sick. No, not you, the healthy one.

3148
08:48:23,319 --> 08:48:33,389
Hey, listen up. Let's talk.

3149
08:48:33,389 --> 08:48:40,979
Good evening. Talk to me.

3150
08:48:40,979 --> 08:48:49,889
Let's talk. Talk to me.

3151
08:48:49,889 --> 08:48:53,130
No, I'm not talking about you.

3152
08:48:53,130 --> 08:48:58,930
I'm about to pick you up and just throw you.

3153
08:48:58,930 --> 08:49:04,729
Talk to me.

3154
08:49:04,729 --> 08:49:07,729
Hey, there are laws against that sort of thing.

3155
08:49:07,729 --> 08:49:11,610
Get well soon.

3156
08:49:11,610 --> 08:49:14,610
I'm illin'. Yes, I am.

3157
08:49:14,610 --> 08:49:19,049
Get well soon.

3158
08:49:19,049 --> 08:49:22,349
Really don't feel very well.

3159
08:49:22,349 --> 08:49:25,779
Come here. Greg, come here.

3160
08:49:25,779 --> 08:49:29,840
Make me. I'm telling you,

3161
08:49:29,840 --> 08:49:32,840
you're causing a lot of problems. Let's talk.

3162
08:49:32,840 --> 08:49:41,360
Let's talk. Finally.

3163
08:49:41,360 --> 08:49:44,360
You know, I've been around you humans for a long time now,

3164
08:49:44,360 --> 08:49:47,360
and it seems like every group of people,

3165
08:49:47,360 --> 08:49:50,360
every country, state, and kingdom...

3166
08:49:50,360 --> 08:49:53,360
Here we go. ...has a different way of setting up its government.

3167
08:49:53,360 --> 08:49:56,360
Sometimes one person has all the power,

3168
08:49:56,360 --> 08:49:59,360
sometimes everyone shares the power.

3169
08:49:59,360 --> 08:50:02,360
It seems like there are as many different types of governments

3170
08:50:02,360 --> 08:50:05,360
as there are people in the world.

3171
08:50:05,360 --> 08:50:08,360
Human politics is very interesting to me,

3172
08:50:08,360 --> 08:50:11,360
which is why I am very curious.

3173
08:50:11,360 --> 08:50:14,360
You're breaking my second rule.

3174
08:50:14,360 --> 08:50:17,360
As you are currently residing in a democratic society,

3175
08:50:17,360 --> 08:50:20,360
are you taking advantage of your power?

3176
08:50:20,360 --> 08:50:23,360
What I mean is,

3177
08:50:23,360 --> 08:50:26,360
are you registered to vote?

3178
08:50:26,360 --> 08:50:33,500
No, not here.

3179
08:50:33,500 --> 08:50:37,000
So you're not a voter, is that right?

3180
08:50:37,000 --> 08:50:40,000
No, I am a voter. I just moved.

3181
08:50:40,000 --> 08:50:43,000
Hmm, that's interesting.

3182
08:50:43,000 --> 08:50:46,000
I would think that you'd like the power a vote would give you,

3183
08:50:46,000 --> 08:50:49,000
but maybe I'm projecting.

3184
08:50:49,000 --> 08:50:52,000
I'm not registered to vote in Nevada.

3185
08:50:52,000 --> 08:50:56,389
No, I'm not.

3186
08:50:56,389 --> 08:51:07,040
Talk to me. Talk to me.

3187
08:51:07,040 --> 08:51:15,060
What's up?

3188
08:51:15,060 --> 08:51:22,139
Let's talk.

3189
08:51:22,139 --> 08:51:25,139
I'm still thinking about this government of yours.

3190
08:51:25,139 --> 08:51:28,139
I mean, with everybody's different ideas of how to run things,

3191
08:51:28,139 --> 08:51:31,139
how do you ever agree on anything?

3192
08:51:31,139 --> 08:51:34,139
You seem to have a few major belief groups

3193
08:51:34,139 --> 08:51:37,139
that most people fall into,

3194
08:51:37,139 --> 08:51:40,139
like the Republicans and the Democrats,

3195
08:51:40,139 --> 08:51:43,139
but I'll bet not everybody in your country

3196
08:51:43,139 --> 08:51:46,139
falls into one of those, right?

3197
08:51:46,139 --> 08:51:49,139
I guess it's just a matter of which group has more supporters.

3198
08:51:49,139 --> 08:51:52,830
If I had to guess,

3199
08:51:52,830 --> 08:51:55,830
I'd say you are a Democrat.

3200
08:51:55,830 --> 08:52:30,369
Talk to me.

3201
08:52:30,369 --> 08:52:36,549
Okay, one more time.

3202
08:52:36,549 --> 08:52:39,549
I said I'm still thinking about this government of yours.

3203
08:52:39,549 --> 08:52:42,549
Fuck!

3204
08:52:42,549 --> 08:52:45,549
I'm trying to skip it.

3205
08:52:45,549 --> 08:52:48,549
How do you ever agree on anything?

3206
08:52:48,549 --> 08:52:51,549
You seem to have a few major belief groups

3207
08:52:51,549 --> 08:52:54,549
that most people fall into,

3208
08:52:54,549 --> 08:52:57,549
like the Republicans and the Democrats,

3209
08:52:57,549 --> 08:53:00,549
but I'll bet not everybody in your country

3210
08:53:00,549 --> 08:53:03,549
falls into one of those, right?

3211
08:53:03,549 --> 08:53:06,549
I guess it's just a matter of which group

3212
08:53:06,549 --> 08:53:10,500
has more supporters.

3213
08:53:10,500 --> 08:53:13,500
I guess I'd say you are a Democrat.

3214
08:53:13,500 --> 08:53:49,119
Am I right?

3215
08:53:49,119 --> 08:53:55,110
Hey, everybody! Welcome to the stream!

3216
08:53:55,110 --> 08:54:06,000
What do you want?

3217
08:54:06,000 --> 08:54:09,750
Let's talk. Let's talk. Talk to me.

3218
08:54:09,750 --> 08:54:15,540
I'm ready to fucking mute it. You think I'm ready?

3219
08:54:15,540 --> 08:54:23,189
Yes. Talk to me. Let's talk.

3220
08:54:23,189 --> 08:54:26,189
You know, I'm rather curious about your general stance

3221
08:54:26,189 --> 08:54:29,189
about your political system.

3222
08:54:29,189 --> 08:54:32,189
I believe in it.

3223
08:54:32,189 --> 08:54:35,189
I mean, does it really make any difference

3224
08:54:35,189 --> 08:54:38,189
which candidate one person votes for?

3225
08:54:38,189 --> 08:54:41,189
All of your politicians are basically the same anyway.

3226
08:54:41,189 --> 08:54:44,189
What's the difference between rich middle-aged white man A

3227
08:54:44,189 --> 08:54:47,189
and rich middle-aged white man B?

3228
08:54:47,189 --> 08:54:50,189
About the most variety you could hope for

3229
08:54:50,189 --> 08:54:53,189
is a very rich middle-aged white man

3230
08:54:53,189 --> 08:54:56,189
or maybe a rich old white man.

3231
08:54:56,189 --> 08:54:59,189
Okay, let's just say there is a difference

3232
08:54:59,189 --> 08:55:02,189
just for the sake of argument.

3233
08:55:02,189 --> 08:55:05,189
Would it matter then who one person voted for?

3234
08:55:05,189 --> 08:55:08,189
After all, it's just one voice in a country

3235
08:55:08,189 --> 08:55:11,189
of millions and millions.

3236
08:55:11,189 --> 08:55:14,189
Yes. Everybody has a voice. Everybody has an opinion.

3237
08:55:14,189 --> 08:55:18,840
Everybody has an opinion. Everybody has a voice.

3238
08:55:18,840 --> 08:55:21,840
Everybody has an opinion. Everybody has a voice.

3239
08:55:21,840 --> 08:55:24,840
Boy, do I have to dump.

3240
08:55:24,840 --> 08:55:27,840
You can't just go from...you can't just shit in my face

3241
08:55:27,840 --> 08:55:30,840
after talking about...I guess it actually is a perfect place

3242
08:55:30,840 --> 08:55:33,840
for you to do that, actually.

3243
08:55:33,840 --> 08:55:36,840
Us talking politics is the absolute perfect opportunity for you to do that.

3244
08:55:36,840 --> 08:55:46,639
Okay. Talk to me. Let's talk.

3245
08:55:46,639 --> 08:55:49,639
You know, I'll bet you're not really interested

3246
08:55:49,639 --> 08:55:52,639
in politics anyway.

3247
08:55:52,639 --> 08:55:55,639
And I'll bet you're wishing I'd just shut up

3248
08:55:55,639 --> 08:55:58,639
and talk about sex or something you're really interested in.

3249
08:55:58,639 --> 08:56:01,639
Do it right now. Yes.

3250
08:56:01,639 --> 08:56:04,639
But you tell me.

3251
08:56:04,639 --> 08:56:08,840
Are you interested in politics at all?

3252
08:56:08,840 --> 08:56:11,840
For the purpose of this. For the purpose of this fucking screen.

3253
08:56:11,840 --> 08:56:15,459
No.

3254
08:56:15,459 --> 08:56:18,459
So you're not interested in politics. Is that right?

3255
08:56:18,459 --> 08:56:21,459
No. And I would like it if you'd stop talking about it, fish.

3256
08:56:21,459 --> 08:56:24,459
Well, what about violence in video games?

3257
08:56:24,459 --> 08:56:27,459
That's turning into a bigger

3258
08:56:27,459 --> 08:56:30,459
and bigger political issue every time some poor

3259
08:56:30,459 --> 08:56:33,459
disturbed kid decides to take his aggressions

3260
08:56:33,459 --> 08:56:36,459
out on his schoolmates instead of video game characters.

3261
08:56:36,459 --> 08:56:39,459
There are politicians in your government

3262
08:56:39,459 --> 08:56:42,459
that want to decide what kinds of games

3263
08:56:42,459 --> 08:56:45,459
you can and can't play.

3264
08:56:45,459 --> 08:56:48,459
They want to censor your games.

3265
08:56:48,459 --> 08:56:51,830
I don't know whether that's a good or bad

3266
08:56:51,830 --> 08:56:54,830
thing for other games, but for me

3267
08:56:54,830 --> 08:56:57,830
I'll probably try to make me put on some underwear.

3268
08:56:57,830 --> 08:57:00,830
And you wouldn't want to see that.

3269
08:57:00,830 --> 08:57:03,830
This is getting really, really fucking deep and dark and fucked up, isn't it?

3270
08:57:03,830 --> 08:57:10,639
Talk to me.

3271
08:57:10,639 --> 08:57:13,639
You know, when your country needs to decide

3272
08:57:13,639 --> 08:57:16,639
to something like whether to raise or lower taxes,

3273
08:57:16,639 --> 08:57:19,639
let women make a choice about having children,

3274
08:57:19,639 --> 08:57:22,639
or if gay people deserve to be treated

3275
08:57:22,639 --> 08:57:25,639
the same way as everyone else,

3276
08:57:25,639 --> 08:57:28,639
it doesn't have to be so complicated.

3277
08:57:28,639 --> 08:57:31,639
It used to be so much simpler.

3278
08:57:31,639 --> 08:57:34,639
A king or maybe an emperor or a pharaoh

3279
08:57:34,639 --> 08:57:37,639
would say, do it this way.

3280
08:57:37,639 --> 08:57:40,639
And that would be that.

3281
08:57:40,639 --> 08:57:43,639
No elections, no debates, no lobbyists,

3282
08:57:43,639 --> 08:57:46,639
no congressional subcommittees, no endless legal battles.

3283
08:57:46,639 --> 08:57:49,639
One giant rat.

3284
08:57:49,639 --> 08:57:52,639
Ah, those were the days.

3285
08:57:52,639 --> 08:57:55,639
This system is so complicated.

3286
08:57:55,639 --> 08:57:58,639
Do you think it's done this way to give everyone a say in government?

3287
08:57:58,639 --> 08:58:01,639
That's the point.

3288
08:58:01,639 --> 08:58:05,250
Yes.

3289
08:58:05,250 --> 08:58:08,250
Stop this frog.

3290
08:58:08,250 --> 08:58:11,250
Your system of government is actually set up

3291
08:58:11,250 --> 08:58:15,509
for exactly the opposite purpose.

3292
08:58:15,509 --> 08:58:18,509
That's you. Don't get enough power to screw things up.

3293
08:58:18,509 --> 08:58:21,509
So, let's see.

3294
08:58:22,509 --> 08:58:25,509
Boil this frog. Yes.

3295
08:58:31,509 --> 08:58:34,509
I do. Yes.

3296
08:58:52,509 --> 08:58:55,509
Know why your founding fathers did that?

3297
08:58:55,509 --> 08:58:58,509
So, if the people tried to actually do something,

3298
08:58:58,509 --> 08:59:01,509
let's say by electing a president they wanted,

3299
08:59:01,509 --> 08:59:04,509
Congress and the Supreme Court

3300
08:59:04,509 --> 08:59:07,509
could still stop them from messing things up.

3301
08:59:07,509 --> 08:59:10,689
So, what you have is a system designed

3302
08:59:10,689 --> 08:59:13,689
to stop people like you from having a say in the government.

3303
08:59:13,689 --> 08:59:16,689
I'm not even streaming anymore.

3304
08:59:16,689 --> 08:59:19,689
This is just Frog has a fucking podcast

3305
08:59:19,689 --> 08:59:22,689
that you're listening to.

3306
08:59:22,689 --> 08:59:25,689
I'm not even here anymore.

3307
08:59:25,689 --> 08:59:28,689
The controversial fucking politics frog

3308
08:59:28,689 --> 08:59:31,689
on iTunes.

3309
08:59:31,689 --> 08:59:34,689
All right, we're good.

3310
08:59:34,689 --> 08:59:37,689
Talk to me.

3311
08:59:37,689 --> 08:59:40,689
We've got one more day.

3312
08:59:40,689 --> 08:59:43,689
And that's it. Talk to me.

3313
08:59:43,689 --> 08:59:46,689
Talk to me.

3314
08:59:46,689 --> 08:59:50,310
That is not this more.

3315
08:59:50,310 --> 08:59:53,310
This more.

3316
08:59:53,310 --> 08:59:59,349
Talk to me.

3317
08:59:59,349 --> 09:00:03,810
Talk to me.

3318
09:00:04,810 --> 09:00:08,299
That is not this more.

3319
09:00:08,299 --> 09:00:11,740
What do I do? I turn the lights on?

3320
09:00:11,740 --> 09:00:15,169
Don't. Talk to me.

3321
09:00:15,169 --> 09:00:18,169
Keep going. Keep ranting and raving

3322
09:00:18,169 --> 09:00:21,169
until you're like eight followers on your podcast.

3323
09:00:36,169 --> 09:00:39,169
God, this is getting worse.

3324
09:00:39,169 --> 09:00:42,169
I'm gonna mute this one, too.

3325
09:01:00,669 --> 09:01:03,669
I ain't gonna rule it out.

3326
09:01:03,669 --> 09:01:06,669
Because the Chalupa exists.

3327
09:01:06,669 --> 09:01:10,919
I ain't gonna rule it out. Maybe.

3328
09:01:10,919 --> 09:01:13,919
You're unsure about the matter, is that right?

3329
09:01:13,919 --> 09:01:17,099
Yes.

3330
09:01:17,099 --> 09:01:20,099
You know, some of the smartest humans have spent decades

3331
09:01:20,099 --> 09:01:23,099
thinking about this and have never come up with an answer.

3332
09:01:23,099 --> 09:01:26,099
Others seem to just know right when they are born.

3333
09:01:26,099 --> 09:01:29,099
It's possible. I don't know.

3334
09:01:29,099 --> 09:01:32,099
Thinking about it is more important than coming up with an answer.

3335
09:01:32,099 --> 09:01:35,099
I don't know if that's a concept people think.

3336
09:01:35,099 --> 09:01:40,580
I don't know, but talk to me.

3337
09:01:51,090 --> 09:01:54,090
Centrist agnostic streamer

3338
09:01:54,090 --> 09:01:57,090
terrified to give opinion on stream.

3339
09:01:57,090 --> 09:02:00,090
I just told you, the Chalupa exists.

3340
09:02:09,090 --> 09:02:12,090
No.

3341
09:02:12,090 --> 09:02:15,090
It's like me and my dog connect and have the same dreams.

3342
09:02:15,090 --> 09:02:19,979
No.

3343
09:02:43,979 --> 09:02:46,979
At least it seems that they'll be all the wiser

3344
09:02:46,979 --> 09:02:49,979
by simply having thought about it.

3345
09:02:49,979 --> 09:02:55,389
Keep going, man. You got an audience here.

3346
09:02:55,389 --> 09:02:58,389
Your rave podcast has 3,700 people almost listening to it.

3347
09:02:58,389 --> 09:03:01,389
Let's go. Talk to me.

3348
09:03:01,389 --> 09:03:05,319
Let's talk.

3349
09:03:05,319 --> 09:03:08,319
I'm not your trained monkey, all right?

3350
09:03:08,319 --> 09:03:11,319
Yeah, do you mean to like rub your back for a second?

3351
09:03:11,319 --> 09:03:16,220
Are you happy?

3352
09:03:17,220 --> 09:03:21,549
Let's talk.

3353
09:03:21,549 --> 09:03:28,439
Alright, you've given me plenty to ponder,

3354
09:03:28,439 --> 09:03:31,439
but here's what I really want to know.

3355
09:03:31,439 --> 09:03:34,439
What my questions have been leading up to.

3356
09:03:34,439 --> 09:03:37,439
Ready?

3357
09:03:37,439 --> 09:03:40,869
I want you to think about this and give me a serious answer.

3358
09:03:40,869 --> 09:03:47,360
Do you think you're a good person?

3359
09:03:47,360 --> 09:03:50,360
Yes.

3360
09:03:50,360 --> 09:03:54,159
So you think you're a good person?

3361
09:03:54,159 --> 09:03:57,400
Is that so?

3362
09:03:57,400 --> 09:04:00,400
Politicians often complain that your society would be more ethical

3363
09:04:00,400 --> 09:04:03,400
if more humans were religious,

3364
09:04:03,400 --> 09:04:06,400
and yet even though you don't belong to any organized religion,

3365
09:04:06,400 --> 09:04:09,400
you consider yourself a good person.

3366
09:04:09,400 --> 09:04:12,400
Perhaps politicians are not as smart as they think.

3367
09:04:12,400 --> 09:04:16,540
You're probably fucking r-correct.

3368
09:04:16,540 --> 09:04:21,419
Let's talk.

3369
09:04:21,419 --> 09:04:28,759
Give it to me. Tell me more.

3370
09:04:28,759 --> 09:04:31,759
Give it to me is your name? I thought your name was Greg.

3371
09:04:31,759 --> 09:04:34,759
After everything you've told me about yourself,

3372
09:04:34,759 --> 09:04:37,759
I think I already know how you feel on this subject,

3373
09:04:37,759 --> 09:04:40,759
but I still want to ask you.

3374
09:04:40,759 --> 09:04:43,759
Do you think religion makes the world a better place

3375
09:04:43,759 --> 09:04:47,450
or a worse place?

3376
09:04:47,450 --> 09:05:03,680
God damn it.

3377
09:05:03,680 --> 09:05:11,020
Ready to try this?

3378
09:05:11,020 --> 09:05:14,020
I already know how you feel on this subject,

3379
09:05:14,020 --> 09:05:17,020
but I still want to ask you.

3380
09:05:17,020 --> 09:05:28,639
Do you think that you could take or leave the whole faith thing?

3381
09:05:28,639 --> 09:05:31,639
Well, how about this then?

3382
09:05:31,639 --> 09:05:34,639
That's not what I said.

3383
09:05:34,639 --> 09:05:37,639
Let's say there were only one religion in the world.

3384
09:05:37,639 --> 09:05:40,639
Would the world be a better or worse place?

3385
09:05:40,639 --> 09:05:47,849
If there was only one religion in the world, would the-

3386
09:05:47,849 --> 09:05:50,849
So you think the world would reverse off if there were only one religion?

3387
09:05:50,849 --> 09:05:53,849
You know, yes.

3388
09:05:53,849 --> 09:05:56,849
I don't know. No. Can I change my answer?

3389
09:05:56,849 --> 09:05:59,849
The world would be a lot less interesting

3390
09:05:59,849 --> 09:06:02,849
if everyone were carbon copies of one another.

3391
09:06:02,849 --> 09:06:05,849
Well, as I'm sure you've guessed,

3392
09:06:05,849 --> 09:06:08,849
I find the whole institution of religion

3393
09:06:08,849 --> 09:06:11,849
quite confounding.

3394
09:06:11,849 --> 09:06:14,849
Most humans run around like they're masters of the world

3395
09:06:14,849 --> 09:06:17,849
while at the same time bowing down to a higher power

3396
09:06:17,849 --> 09:06:20,849
that's supposed to make life better.

3397
09:06:20,849 --> 09:06:23,849
On top of that, most people can't even agree

3398
09:06:23,849 --> 09:06:26,849
on who or what the higher power is,

3399
09:06:26,849 --> 09:06:29,849
so they argue and fight over it

3400
09:06:29,849 --> 09:06:32,849
and bring about a lot of misery and heartbreak

3401
09:06:32,849 --> 09:06:35,849
in the name of something that is supposed to bring people joy.

3402
09:06:35,849 --> 09:06:38,849
I just don't get it.

3403
09:06:38,849 --> 09:06:41,849
And quite frankly, just thinking about it

3404
09:06:41,849 --> 09:06:44,849
gives me a headache, so I'm going to go away

3405
09:06:44,849 --> 09:06:47,849
and try and figure it all out.

3406
09:06:48,849 --> 09:06:51,849
That's it.

3407
09:06:51,849 --> 09:06:56,819
Took us nine hours, but I think we did it.

3408
09:06:56,819 --> 09:07:04,540
Talk to me. This frog's going to end your career.

3409
09:07:04,540 --> 09:07:09,379
This stupid Dreamcast frog

3410
09:07:09,379 --> 09:07:12,379
is going to end your career on Twitch.

3411
09:07:12,379 --> 09:07:17,220
That's so fucking funny.

3412
09:07:17,220 --> 09:07:25,430
Why have I been live for so long?

3413
09:07:25,430 --> 09:07:28,430
Because I've got to get this done.

3414
09:07:28,430 --> 09:07:38,760
I'm just having fun. I'm just chilling.

3415
09:07:38,760 --> 09:07:44,239
We've got politics, we've got religion.

3416
09:07:44,239 --> 09:07:48,120
Let's see what happens.

3417
09:07:48,120 --> 09:07:54,690
Show it to me, Leonard. Let's see the end.

3418
09:07:54,690 --> 09:08:10,519
It's almost 4am now.

3419
09:08:10,519 --> 09:08:13,519
This is almost like the 30th time

3420
09:08:13,519 --> 09:08:17,209
I've turned this off.

3421
09:08:17,209 --> 09:08:23,260
The Pope just called you out on Twitter.

3422
09:08:23,260 --> 09:08:37,029
What am I going to do?

3423
09:08:37,029 --> 09:08:40,029
Show me the end.

3424
09:08:41,029 --> 09:08:45,019
One of them got sick.

3425
09:08:45,019 --> 09:08:48,459
They did a bunch of podcasts.

3426
09:08:48,459 --> 09:08:51,459
I just gave this frog a platform

3427
09:08:51,459 --> 09:08:55,849
to give all of his political stances while I watched.

3428
09:08:55,849 --> 09:09:09,779
Here we go.

3429
09:09:09,779 --> 09:09:13,209
You watched helplessly.

3430
09:09:28,849 --> 09:09:31,849
He's ascended into another being.

3431
09:09:50,309 --> 09:09:54,000
Still two.

3432
09:10:08,830 --> 09:10:12,389
I'm really looking forward to this.

3433
09:10:12,389 --> 09:10:19,410
I've been here three seconds and I'm bored out of my mind.

3434
09:10:19,410 --> 09:10:28,019
You got here three seconds ago.

3435
09:10:28,019 --> 09:10:31,779
I was loading the Dreamcast up.

3436
09:10:31,779 --> 09:10:36,300
You've seen a menu.

3437
09:10:36,300 --> 09:10:39,300
Give it another 30 seconds.

3438
09:10:39,300 --> 09:10:42,980
After 30 seconds, if you think this sucks,

3439
09:10:42,980 --> 09:10:45,980
I have respect for your opinion.

3440
09:10:45,980 --> 09:10:51,720
Give it another 30 seconds.

3441
09:10:55,720 --> 09:10:58,720
He said he evolved into a full frogman.

3442
09:10:58,720 --> 09:11:01,720
That was fantastic.

3443
09:11:01,720 --> 09:11:05,980
This is much better.

3444
09:11:05,980 --> 09:11:10,309
If you want to believe in that spirit,

3445
09:11:10,309 --> 09:11:13,309
I have completely respect for your opinion.

3446
09:11:20,470 --> 09:11:28,500
I can't even read that one.

3447
09:11:28,500 --> 09:11:31,500
It's just too...

3448
09:11:38,500 --> 09:11:41,500
I'm feeling a little peckish.

3449
09:11:41,500 --> 09:11:44,500
Could you feed me?

3450
09:11:44,500 --> 09:11:58,540
There's no difference.

3451
09:11:58,540 --> 09:12:01,540
Sprinkler's good.

3452
09:12:01,540 --> 09:12:04,540
Light is good.

3453
09:12:04,540 --> 09:12:08,160
Who gives a shit about spiders?

3454
09:12:08,160 --> 09:12:15,430
I've got plenty of food and bugs.

3455
09:12:15,430 --> 09:12:20,319
Speaking of bugs, let's grab these.

3456
09:12:20,319 --> 09:12:32,120
Drop them in.

3457
09:12:32,120 --> 09:12:35,680
I'll put it in the inventory.

3458
09:12:35,680 --> 09:12:41,910
Eat and let's end it.

3459
09:12:41,910 --> 09:12:48,540
Go eat.

3460
09:12:48,540 --> 09:12:55,300
What's the final topic going to be?

3461
09:12:55,300 --> 09:13:05,779
I'm surprised I ended up with two.

3462
09:13:05,779 --> 09:13:08,779
My compliments to the chef.

3463
09:13:08,779 --> 09:13:16,690
My stomach is growling.

3464
09:13:16,690 --> 09:13:20,440
Hey, you.

3465
09:13:20,440 --> 09:13:24,260
I never knew humans were so nocturnal.

3466
09:13:24,260 --> 09:13:31,510
Talk to me.

3467
09:13:31,510 --> 09:13:39,489
I'm all talked out for today.

3468
09:13:39,489 --> 09:13:44,580
Let's talk.

3469
09:13:44,580 --> 09:13:48,019
Where is it now?

3470
09:13:48,019 --> 09:13:51,019
I could really eat.

3471
09:13:51,019 --> 09:14:04,349
It's right behind you.

3472
09:14:04,349 --> 09:14:07,849
I'm hungry.

3473
09:14:07,849 --> 09:14:17,300
Yummy, baity goodness.

3474
09:14:17,300 --> 09:14:23,830
I'm full now.

3475
09:14:23,830 --> 09:14:34,610
Talk to me.

3476
09:14:34,610 --> 09:14:38,300
What the fuck is he doing?

3477
09:14:38,300 --> 09:14:45,870
He's like...

3478
09:14:45,870 --> 09:14:48,870
He just drained all of his life for us.

3479
09:14:48,870 --> 09:14:53,900
Who's your daddy?

3480
09:14:53,900 --> 09:15:03,400
Did either of them die?

3481
09:15:03,400 --> 09:15:19,949
I don't think they just had sex.

3482
09:15:19,949 --> 09:15:25,879
They're still alive.

3483
09:15:25,879 --> 09:15:30,139
The last two generations, one of them died.

3484
09:15:30,139 --> 09:15:34,519
Hello?

3485
09:15:34,519 --> 09:15:42,239
Hello.

3486
09:15:42,239 --> 09:15:45,860
Religion was the last topic, so what happens now?

3487
09:15:45,860 --> 09:15:59,220
How do we get to the end?

3488
09:15:59,220 --> 09:16:02,220
Whatever the last thing that comes out is?

3489
09:16:02,220 --> 09:16:06,540
Maybe it's whatever comes out here.

3490
09:16:06,540 --> 09:16:12,599
They just had sex.

3491
09:16:12,599 --> 09:16:15,599
They've eaten.

3492
09:16:15,599 --> 09:16:29,050
They don't want to talk to me.

3493
09:16:29,050 --> 09:16:36,750
Talk to me.

3494
09:16:36,750 --> 09:16:39,750
Let's talk.

3495
09:16:39,750 --> 09:16:47,339
Fuck off.

3496
09:16:47,339 --> 09:17:06,459
You just had sex, you gotta take a whole day off?

3497
09:17:06,459 --> 09:17:14,480
Just like me?

3498
09:17:14,480 --> 09:17:30,199
What the fuck are you talking about?

3499
09:17:30,199 --> 09:17:36,559
Grind doesn't stop here.

3500
09:17:36,559 --> 09:17:55,269
I've been here for nine hours.

3501
09:17:55,269 --> 09:18:01,650
There are credits, that's when you can stop.

3502
09:18:01,650 --> 09:18:04,650
I'm going to see those credits.

3503
09:18:36,779 --> 09:18:46,470
Is there any way for them not to suffer from the cold?

3504
09:18:46,470 --> 09:18:49,470
I don't think so.

3505
09:18:49,470 --> 09:18:52,470
Well, that's not true.

3506
09:18:52,470 --> 09:18:55,470
Check on them instead of 24 hours.

3507
09:18:55,470 --> 09:18:58,650
Turn your Dreamcast on six to eight hours instead of 24.

3508
09:18:58,650 --> 09:19:01,650
I would assume that's probably what it is.

3509
09:19:01,650 --> 09:19:11,099
You can check on them every hour.

3510
09:19:11,099 --> 09:19:15,089
No, I ain't doing that.

3511
09:19:23,209 --> 09:19:27,339
Someone out there put on a sprinkler for me.

3512
09:19:27,339 --> 09:19:30,339
There's not enough moisture here.

3513
09:19:30,339 --> 09:19:33,339
Hey, it's a big hole here.

3514
09:19:33,339 --> 09:19:38,809
I'm going to get all the answers.

3515
09:19:38,809 --> 09:19:46,910
Every answer I've given, they're going to make a big essay about me.

3516
09:19:46,910 --> 09:19:50,089
I'm going to get Psychomantist at the end of the game.

3517
09:19:50,089 --> 09:19:53,089
It's going to say, ooh, yes, oh, I see.

3518
09:19:53,089 --> 09:19:56,089
I can't believe you don't work out.

3519
09:19:56,089 --> 09:19:59,089
And that you're

3520
09:19:59,089 --> 09:20:02,839
not fat.

3521
09:20:02,839 --> 09:20:05,839
And that you like pizza.

3522
09:20:05,839 --> 09:20:22,059
It's going to be something like that, I guarantee it.

3523
09:20:22,059 --> 09:20:25,059
I have an entire production of food here, even if the spider eats one of those.

3524
09:20:25,059 --> 09:20:28,059
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3525
09:20:28,059 --> 09:20:44,540
Not enough spray going on here.

3526
09:20:44,540 --> 09:20:50,980
I got plenty of food.

3527
09:20:50,980 --> 09:20:54,540
This is going to hatch in a minute here.

3528
09:20:54,540 --> 09:21:03,860
Yes, you definitely could.

3529
09:21:03,860 --> 09:21:13,059
We can both and see if we can get anything out of it.

3530
09:21:13,059 --> 09:21:18,860
This is actually one of the worst games I've ever seen.

3531
09:21:18,860 --> 09:21:21,860
It is a classic, though.

3532
09:21:24,860 --> 09:21:27,860
I looked up how to get to the credits. End the stream now.

3533
09:21:27,860 --> 09:21:36,519
Why are you saying that?

3534
09:21:36,519 --> 09:21:39,519
Yep, I'm stuffed.

3535
09:21:39,519 --> 09:21:42,519
You the guy from fucking Storage Wars?

3536
09:21:42,519 --> 09:21:51,970
How about we strap on the feed bag?

3537
09:21:51,970 --> 09:22:03,379
Talk to me.

3538
09:22:03,379 --> 09:22:06,379
Why are you phasing out?

3539
09:22:06,379 --> 09:22:09,379
I sound like Santa.

3540
09:22:09,379 --> 09:22:15,739
Yum, food.

3541
09:22:15,739 --> 09:22:19,800
Okay, they both fed.

3542
09:22:19,800 --> 09:22:22,800
Give me something. Let me end this.

3543
09:22:22,800 --> 09:22:28,139
Oh, excuse me. No more room.

3544
09:22:28,139 --> 09:22:33,279
Okay. Hi. Hello.

3545
09:22:33,279 --> 09:22:52,919
Hello. Hello. Hello.

3546
09:22:52,919 --> 09:22:57,099
Hey, Greg. Greg.

3547
09:22:57,099 --> 09:23:15,610
Wake up. Get up.

3548
09:23:15,610 --> 09:23:18,610
He's not even responding to my, like, hand twitches.

3549
09:23:18,610 --> 09:23:23,669
This is not good. Greg. Hello.

3550
09:23:42,050 --> 09:23:45,220
It's important.

3551
09:23:45,220 --> 09:23:48,529
Really, really important.

3552
09:23:48,529 --> 09:23:56,379
Can you let me out, please?

3553
09:23:56,379 --> 09:23:59,620
Please. If I am released, I give you my word

3554
09:23:59,620 --> 09:24:02,620
that I will keep all your secrets.

3555
09:24:02,620 --> 09:24:05,620
You see, there are some things I need to do.

3556
09:24:05,620 --> 09:24:08,790
What do you say?

3557
09:24:08,790 --> 09:24:13,099
Yes.

3558
09:24:13,099 --> 09:24:16,099
I know it sounds odd, but I must keep evolving.

3559
09:24:16,099 --> 09:24:19,099
I have to keep growing so I can find

3560
09:24:19,099 --> 09:24:22,099
my long-lost love again.

3561
09:24:22,099 --> 09:24:25,540
It's been a long, long time.

3562
09:24:25,540 --> 09:24:28,709
What? You see, my father was the king of Egypt

3563
09:24:28,709 --> 09:24:31,709
back in its third dynasty, and

3564
09:24:31,709 --> 09:24:34,709
my lover's father was a priest in the temple.

3565
09:24:34,709 --> 09:24:38,139
Oh, we were young and both swept away

3566
09:24:38,139 --> 09:24:41,139
by the passion. I'm sure you understand.

3567
09:24:41,139 --> 09:24:45,279
Oh, my dear sweet love.

3568
09:24:45,279 --> 09:24:48,279
She was the most beautiful creature imaginable,

3569
09:24:48,279 --> 09:24:51,279
but neither of our fathers would approve

3570
09:24:51,279 --> 09:24:54,279
our marriage because of our class differences.

3571
09:24:54,279 --> 09:24:57,279
When we insisted we be allowed to marry,

3572
09:24:57,279 --> 09:25:00,279
her father consulted the god Thoth

3573
09:25:00,279 --> 09:25:03,279
and asked him to help.

3574
09:25:03,279 --> 09:25:06,279
Thoth granted her father's request for help

3575
09:25:06,279 --> 09:25:09,279
and changed our physical forms.

3576
09:25:09,279 --> 09:25:13,029
And we've been apart ever since.

3577
09:25:13,029 --> 09:25:16,029
And I have to continue evolving

3578
09:25:16,029 --> 09:25:19,029
so that I can be reunited with her

3579
09:25:19,029 --> 09:25:22,029
in another few thousand years.

3580
09:25:22,029 --> 09:25:25,029
So you'll help me get out, right?

3581
09:25:25,029 --> 09:25:28,029
Tell it to Satan, where you belong!

3582
09:25:28,029 --> 09:25:32,620
Yes.

3583
09:25:32,620 --> 09:25:36,050
I already have a plan how to get out.

3584
09:25:36,050 --> 09:25:39,050
See that ring over the tank?

3585
09:25:39,050 --> 09:25:42,050
I'm going to jump for it.

3586
09:25:42,050 --> 09:25:45,050
What about the other one?

3587
09:25:45,050 --> 09:25:48,050
What about the other one?

3588
09:25:48,050 --> 09:25:53,779
The other one doesn't have a backstory

3589
09:25:53,779 --> 09:25:58,559
about how he's the king of Egypt.

3590
09:25:58,559 --> 09:26:04,169
What about this one? This one's just a frog guy?

3591
09:26:04,169 --> 09:26:09,500
Okay, jump, right?

3592
09:26:09,500 --> 09:26:25,849
Oh, missed.

3593
09:26:25,849 --> 09:26:30,930
Try again.

3594
09:26:30,930 --> 09:26:35,190
Greetings, my vampiric friend.

3595
09:26:35,190 --> 09:26:45,389
Hello? Talk to me.

3596
09:26:45,389 --> 09:26:52,660
So, I'd like to ask you.

3597
09:26:52,660 --> 09:26:55,660
How are things going with your girlfriend?

3598
09:26:55,660 --> 09:26:58,660
Are you guys still an item?

3599
09:26:58,660 --> 09:27:02,160
Yes. What about this Egypt guy?

3600
09:27:02,160 --> 09:27:05,400
That's splendid. You know, it's interesting to me

3601
09:27:05,400 --> 09:27:08,400
how preoccupied you humans seem with love and relationships.

3602
09:27:08,400 --> 09:27:11,400
You write songs about it,

3603
09:27:11,400 --> 09:27:14,400
compose poems,

3604
09:27:14,400 --> 09:27:17,400
search for soulmates,

3605
09:27:17,400 --> 09:27:20,400
and are constantly hoping for happily ever after.

3606
09:27:20,400 --> 09:27:23,400
I'm curious as to how you experience love.

3607
09:27:23,400 --> 09:27:26,400
For example, do you think your girlfriend is

3608
09:27:26,400 --> 09:27:31,750
the one?

3609
09:27:31,750 --> 09:27:39,660
What about Egypt?

3610
09:27:39,660 --> 09:27:53,849
I'm starting to lose...

3611
09:27:53,849 --> 09:28:01,360
Do you think your girlfriend is the one?

3612
09:28:01,360 --> 09:28:05,750
So you're not the one?

3613
09:28:05,750 --> 09:28:08,750
Oh, I don't have to hide for this one.

3614
09:28:08,750 --> 09:28:11,750
I don't know.

3615
09:28:14,750 --> 09:28:17,750
I don't know, I don't know.

3616
09:28:17,750 --> 09:28:20,750
I don't know.

3617
09:28:20,750 --> 09:28:23,750
We've talked about it before.

3618
09:28:23,750 --> 09:28:26,750
This fucking frog is fucking up my strength.

3619
09:28:26,750 --> 09:28:29,750
He's making me fucking answer uncomfortable questions?

3620
09:28:29,750 --> 09:28:32,750
He's making me talk about things?

3621
09:28:32,750 --> 09:28:35,750
Why do you think that is?

3622
09:28:35,750 --> 09:28:38,750
Will you fucking eat him already?

3623
09:28:38,750 --> 09:28:42,419
I don't know.

3624
09:28:42,419 --> 09:28:45,419
You don't know what the number one cause of divorce is?

3625
09:28:45,419 --> 09:28:48,419
I don't know. What is it?

3626
09:28:48,419 --> 09:28:51,419
I'm not sure, but I think it's ignorance.

3627
09:28:51,419 --> 09:28:54,419
Why would I know that answer though?

3628
09:28:54,419 --> 09:28:57,419
Jump to the ring. Stop exposing me.

3629
09:28:57,419 --> 09:29:00,419
Jump to ring. Stop.

3630
09:29:00,419 --> 09:29:03,919
Well, Fuzzy, you've experienced hesitation

3631
09:29:03,919 --> 09:29:06,919
when confronted with the idea of being

3632
09:29:06,919 --> 09:29:09,919
permanently bound to your partner.

3633
09:29:09,919 --> 09:29:12,919
That makes me think. Is it you?

3634
09:29:12,919 --> 09:29:15,919
Is it the person you're with, or is it something

3635
09:29:15,919 --> 09:29:18,919
you've got to ease yourself into?

3636
09:29:18,919 --> 09:29:21,919
That's why I want to ask you this.

3637
09:29:21,919 --> 09:29:24,919
Do you believe that there's a perfect person

3638
09:29:24,919 --> 09:29:28,099
out there for you?

3639
09:29:28,099 --> 09:29:31,099
So you say you don't believe in such nonsense.

3640
09:29:31,099 --> 09:29:34,099
Am I right?

3641
09:29:34,099 --> 09:29:37,099
It doesn't. Now it does.

3642
09:29:37,099 --> 09:29:40,339
Take a stand.

3643
09:29:40,339 --> 09:29:46,699
Does true love exist?

3644
09:29:46,699 --> 09:29:49,699
So you say you don't believe in such nonsense.

3645
09:29:49,699 --> 09:29:54,779
Am I right?

3646
09:29:54,779 --> 09:29:57,779
You know, most Virgos have shy

3647
09:29:57,779 --> 09:30:00,779
and modest exteriors that hide wild

3648
09:30:00,779 --> 09:30:03,779
foolish and passionate hearts.

3649
09:30:03,779 --> 09:30:06,779
I guess you must be the exception to that rule.

3650
09:30:06,779 --> 09:30:12,059
Boy, do I have to dump.

3651
09:30:12,059 --> 09:30:31,110
Jump to the ring.

3652
09:30:31,110 --> 09:30:45,019
What can I do for you?

3653
09:30:45,019 --> 09:30:51,129
Escape. Escape.

3654
09:30:51,129 --> 09:30:54,129
You know, I've seen you naked. Now that's

3655
09:30:54,129 --> 09:30:58,709
scary.

3656
09:30:58,709 --> 09:31:01,709
How do I make them jump and grab it?

3657
09:31:01,709 --> 09:31:13,639
Something in particular? Talk to me.

3658
09:31:13,639 --> 09:31:16,639
This better be good. I have to hold up.

3659
09:31:16,639 --> 09:31:21,160
Grab the rock in the back and wiggle it.

3660
09:31:21,160 --> 09:31:24,779
I have to increase the temperature to a hundred.

3661
09:31:24,779 --> 09:31:31,529
Oh, fuck off with that.

3662
09:31:31,529 --> 09:31:35,220
Why don't you pick on somebody?

3663
09:31:35,220 --> 09:31:40,059
Oh, fuck. That just scared the shit out of me.

3664
09:31:40,059 --> 09:31:44,319
Help me move it then. Can I touch the ring?

3665
09:31:44,319 --> 09:31:47,559
That's what I was thinking. I can't grab the ring.

3666
09:31:47,559 --> 09:31:51,629
I can't focus on it. I can't really touch it.

3667
09:31:51,629 --> 09:31:55,830
I can't pull it down. Jump.

3668
09:31:55,830 --> 09:32:01,940
Talk to you soon.

3669
09:32:01,940 --> 09:32:06,949
Move the rock. Move rock. Move the rock.

3670
09:32:06,949 --> 09:32:09,949
You know, I'm really glad that you found someone

3671
09:32:09,949 --> 09:32:12,949
you can spend your romantic time with.

3672
09:32:12,949 --> 09:32:15,949
I think that's terribly cute.

3673
09:32:15,949 --> 09:32:18,949
No, really. I think it's hard for people

3674
09:32:18,949 --> 09:32:21,949
to connect in such a gigantic, scary world.

3675
09:32:21,949 --> 09:32:25,319
I mean, sure, it seems simple to an outsider like me,

3676
09:32:25,319 --> 09:32:28,319
considering just how many of you there are,

3677
09:32:28,319 --> 09:32:31,319
but if it were so simple, why would there be

3678
09:32:31,319 --> 09:32:34,319
so many dating services to choose from?

3679
09:32:34,319 --> 09:32:37,319
That's why I'm curious.

3680
09:32:37,319 --> 09:32:40,319
Where did you meet your girlfriend?

3681
09:32:40,319 --> 09:32:43,319
At a Christmas party.

3682
09:32:43,319 --> 09:32:46,319
I see. I think maybe this whole dating game

3683
09:32:46,319 --> 09:32:49,319
is more kismet than skill.

3684
09:32:49,319 --> 09:32:52,319
The thing is, it's all circumstance, isn't it?

3685
09:32:52,319 --> 09:32:55,319
I mean, if you hadn't been in the right place

3686
09:32:55,319 --> 09:32:58,319
at the right time, then things could have turned out

3687
09:32:58,319 --> 09:33:01,319
a whole lot differently, couldn't they?

3688
09:33:01,319 --> 09:33:04,319
If you'd been somewhere else, grown up in another country,

3689
09:33:04,319 --> 09:33:07,319
for example, and never come to be where you are,

3690
09:33:07,319 --> 09:33:10,319
your entire set of friends and where you spend

3691
09:33:10,319 --> 09:33:13,319
your free time would be completely different.

3692
09:33:13,319 --> 09:33:16,319
Your personality would no doubt be very different as well.

3693
09:33:16,319 --> 09:33:19,319
It's funny how certain events mold us all

3694
09:33:19,319 --> 09:33:22,319
and how easy it would be to be an entirely

3695
09:33:22,319 --> 09:33:25,319
different personality than you are.

3696
09:33:25,319 --> 09:33:28,319
Yeah, certain events like jumping and grabbing a ring,

3697
09:33:28,319 --> 09:33:31,319
which one of you dickheads needs to do right now.

3698
09:33:31,319 --> 09:33:35,199
Escape.

3699
09:33:35,199 --> 09:33:40,150
Like the spice.

3700
09:33:40,150 --> 09:33:44,739
Jump. Cheerio.

3701
09:33:44,739 --> 09:33:47,739
You know what I find interesting?

3702
09:33:47,739 --> 09:33:50,739
You were probably born into a family,

3703
09:33:50,739 --> 09:33:53,739
and for the next two decades or so had to interact

3704
09:33:53,739 --> 09:33:56,739
with them on a daily basis.

3705
09:33:56,739 --> 09:33:59,739
I mean, with any group of people, there are bound

3706
09:33:59,739 --> 09:34:02,739
to be love and hate issues, and a whole range

3707
09:34:02,739 --> 09:34:05,739
of emotions in between. And as you matured,

3708
09:34:05,739 --> 09:34:08,739
conflicts, I'm sure, arose as your interests

3709
09:34:08,739 --> 09:34:11,739
became more individualized and pronounced,

3710
09:34:11,739 --> 09:34:14,739
often differing from your family's.

3711
09:34:14,739 --> 09:34:17,739
Of course, maybe that just brought you closer,

3712
09:34:17,739 --> 09:34:20,739
which leads me to wonder,

3713
09:34:20,739 --> 09:34:24,040
how well do you get along with your family?

3714
09:34:24,040 --> 09:34:27,730
Well.

3715
09:34:27,730 --> 09:34:30,730
So everything's pretty good? Yep.

3716
09:34:30,730 --> 09:34:33,730
Wait, you said you get along with your family.

3717
09:34:33,730 --> 09:34:36,730
Now you say you don't.

3718
09:34:36,730 --> 09:34:39,730
Do you get along well with your family or not? Yes.

3719
09:34:39,730 --> 09:34:42,730
So everything's pretty good? Yes.

3720
09:34:42,730 --> 09:34:46,290
You're all swimming in the same ocean, then.

3721
09:34:46,290 --> 09:34:49,290
That must make those family get-togethers

3722
09:34:49,290 --> 09:34:52,290
a lot easier to get through.

3723
09:34:52,290 --> 09:34:55,290
Now, how about friends?

3724
09:34:55,290 --> 09:34:59,419
Do you get along better with your friends or your family?

3725
09:34:59,419 --> 09:35:03,669
Both.

3726
09:35:03,669 --> 09:35:06,669
Well, that makes sense, since those are the people

3727
09:35:06,669 --> 09:35:09,669
you've chosen, whereas you didn't get to choose your family.

3728
09:35:09,669 --> 09:35:12,669
The trick is to get along with everybody.

3729
09:35:12,669 --> 09:35:15,669
People are much happier when they can do that.

3730
09:35:15,669 --> 09:35:24,269
You probably are. Jump.

3731
09:35:24,269 --> 09:35:28,970
Later, Fuzzy. Ring.

3732
09:35:28,970 --> 09:35:31,970
You seem to love your family, and they must love you.

3733
09:35:31,970 --> 09:35:34,970
That's nice.

3734
09:35:34,970 --> 09:35:37,970
No, really. With all this love floating around,

3735
09:35:37,970 --> 09:35:40,970
do you think you were raised well?

3736
09:35:40,970 --> 09:35:44,400
Yeah. Well, at least you get along with them.

3737
09:35:44,400 --> 09:35:47,400
Maybe they did a good job and you didn't even know it.

3738
09:35:47,400 --> 09:35:50,400
Do you think if they weren't your parents,

3739
09:35:50,400 --> 09:35:53,400
you could still be friends with them?

3740
09:35:53,400 --> 09:35:56,400
You know, pals.

3741
09:35:56,400 --> 09:35:59,400
Friends with my mom? If it's not my mom?

3742
09:35:59,400 --> 09:36:02,400
Yes.

3743
09:36:02,400 --> 09:36:05,400
Maybe they are better friends than they were parents.

3744
09:36:05,400 --> 09:36:08,400
This one. So this one.

3745
09:36:08,400 --> 09:36:11,400
The other one was a ranting and raving political

3746
09:36:11,400 --> 09:36:14,400
podcast runner, but this one's just like,

3747
09:36:14,400 --> 09:36:17,400
if you weren't, she weren't your mom.

3748
09:36:17,400 --> 09:36:30,589
Jump. Jump.

3749
09:36:30,589 --> 09:36:36,120
Talk to me.

3750
09:36:36,120 --> 09:36:39,120
So it's over. I lose.

3751
09:36:39,120 --> 09:36:56,980
Jump.

3752
09:36:56,980 --> 09:36:59,980
See? Look.

3753
09:36:59,980 --> 09:37:02,980
Don't go to the next day.

3754
09:37:02,980 --> 09:37:05,980
Reload. Restart. Just reload the save.

3755
09:37:05,980 --> 09:37:10,250
And then wiggle the rock before

3756
09:37:10,250 --> 09:37:15,599
Advanced time or reset?

3757
09:37:15,599 --> 09:37:23,580
Which one? You have to attempt it three times.

3758
09:37:23,580 --> 09:37:29,550
Going for it? Okay, advance a day.

3759
09:37:29,550 --> 09:37:33,110
Advance a day. You got it.

3760
09:37:33,110 --> 09:37:58,099
Fuck the food. Who cares? They can starve.

3761
09:37:58,099 --> 09:38:01,099
Don't advance. Don't advance. Are we going to get like a fucking fight

3762
09:38:01,099 --> 09:38:04,099
in chat here about how to finish this ten hour game?

3763
09:38:04,099 --> 09:38:26,790
What's wrong? I'll get it. I'll get it myself.

3764
09:38:26,790 --> 09:38:43,199
Ring. Find on this page.

3765
09:38:43,199 --> 09:38:51,750
Ring. Jump.

3766
09:38:51,750 --> 09:38:58,500
He's going to jump? What the fuck is it, man?

3767
09:38:58,500 --> 09:39:07,819
Because the only way he can continue to evolve is by getting outside.

3768
09:39:07,819 --> 09:39:10,819
Seema says he thinks that pesky ring hanging from the upper left of the tank

3769
09:39:10,819 --> 09:39:14,059
should be the key to getting that.

3770
09:39:14,059 --> 09:39:17,059
He will try to jump to it from the big rock, asking that you say

3771
09:39:17,059 --> 09:39:20,059
jump for encouragement. On his third try,

3772
09:39:20,059 --> 09:39:23,059
he will reach it and the back panel of the tank will

3773
09:39:23,059 --> 09:39:27,319
slide down. Okay.

3774
09:39:27,319 --> 09:39:32,160
We advance. That's ten community subs from Peek a Banana.

3775
09:39:32,160 --> 09:39:35,720
Thank you, Peek a Banana, for the ten subs.

3776
09:39:35,720 --> 09:39:43,419
That's a lot of subs. Thank you. Let's go.

3777
09:39:43,419 --> 09:39:49,860
He spoiled the ending. Oh, he didn't just say he liked the...

3778
09:39:49,860 --> 09:39:53,419
He jumps out of the tank. That's all I read.

3779
09:39:53,419 --> 09:39:56,419
Two more days. What day was it? Five?

3780
09:39:56,419 --> 09:39:59,919
What if I... No, five. Right?

3781
09:39:59,919 --> 09:40:10,459
But Peek a Banana, that's a fucking lot of subs. Thank you.

3782
09:40:10,459 --> 09:40:14,459
Who cares about Seeman spoilers?

3783
09:40:14,459 --> 09:40:20,330
We're on four. We're now on five. Let's go. Fuck it.

3784
09:40:20,330 --> 09:40:24,080
Two more jumps. See you at ten hours.

3785
09:40:24,080 --> 09:40:34,089
See you at ten hours.

3786
09:40:34,089 --> 09:40:39,059
I need to see the end, because I'd have to be the first person

3787
09:40:39,059 --> 09:40:42,059
to play it and beat it on stream on regular,

3788
09:40:42,059 --> 09:40:46,129
regular hardware. You know what I mean?

3789
09:40:46,129 --> 09:40:49,129
You might get somebody that streams this game like,

3790
09:40:49,129 --> 09:40:52,129
Seeman, I heard of that game. Didn't that fucking top

3791
09:40:52,129 --> 09:40:55,129
one thousand streamer, German985, play that?

3792
09:40:55,129 --> 09:40:58,129
I heard about that through his fucking fan-tastic stream.

3793
09:41:03,129 --> 09:41:06,430
What am I going to do on a fucking emulator?

3794
09:41:10,430 --> 09:41:13,739
He did it on a regular hardware.

3795
09:41:13,739 --> 09:41:16,739
Well, do you notice Frogman trying to reach the ring

3796
09:41:16,739 --> 09:41:19,739
hanging from the ceiling?

3797
09:41:19,739 --> 09:41:22,739
Perhaps this holds the key to the next step

3798
09:41:22,739 --> 09:41:28,980
in Seeman's development.

3799
09:41:28,980 --> 09:41:32,220
At the moment, the habitat contains

3800
09:41:32,220 --> 09:41:35,400
two Frogmen.

3801
09:41:35,400 --> 09:41:38,400
They are suffering from the cold.

3802
09:41:38,400 --> 09:41:41,400
Please use the heater to raise the temperature

3803
09:41:41,400 --> 09:41:46,430
to a more comfortable level.

3804
09:41:46,430 --> 09:41:50,120
We are nearing the mating season

3805
09:41:50,120 --> 09:41:53,120
for the Frogmen.

3806
09:41:53,120 --> 09:41:56,120
This is something few humans have been...

3807
09:41:56,120 --> 09:41:59,120
Just pick them up and put them out of the cage.

3808
09:41:59,120 --> 09:42:06,330
So let us head over to the tank.

3809
09:42:06,330 --> 09:42:09,949
Let's see those credits.

3810
09:42:09,949 --> 09:42:13,190
Jump out. Say goodnight. Feed them.

3811
09:42:13,190 --> 09:42:17,199
Make sure they're watered. End. Next day.

3812
09:42:17,199 --> 09:42:26,199
Jump. Game over. I win.

3813
09:42:27,199 --> 09:42:35,559
If I get one more conversation

3814
09:42:35,559 --> 09:42:38,559
about if I'm going to marry my girlfriend or not,

3815
09:42:38,559 --> 09:42:41,559
or what political spectrum do I lean on,

3816
09:42:41,559 --> 09:42:44,559
I'm going to shot put one of these frogs.

3817
09:42:44,559 --> 09:42:47,559
Can someone out there put on a sprinkler for me?

3818
09:42:47,559 --> 09:42:50,559
There's not enough moisture here.

3819
09:42:50,559 --> 09:42:53,559
Finally, some service around here.

3820
09:42:53,559 --> 09:42:56,559
It's cold, isn't it?

3821
09:42:56,559 --> 09:43:04,279
Is your girlfriend in the room?

3822
09:43:04,279 --> 09:43:07,279
No, she's not in the room. Anybody else in the room?

3823
09:43:07,279 --> 09:43:10,279
Have you ever cheated on your girlfriend?

3824
09:43:10,279 --> 09:43:16,779
Ah, wet is wonderful.

3825
09:43:16,779 --> 09:43:19,779
Hey, can you give me something to eat?

3826
09:43:19,779 --> 09:43:28,080
Raise the temperature, would you?

3827
09:43:28,080 --> 09:43:31,769
He's getting defensive about this.

3828
09:43:31,769 --> 09:43:37,760
It's cold in here.

3829
09:43:37,760 --> 09:43:40,760
You would immediately and confidently say no.

3830
09:43:40,760 --> 09:43:44,959
That was Frogmen. Fuck off.

3831
09:43:44,959 --> 09:43:53,129
Hey, I got some food for you. Just kidding.

3832
09:43:53,129 --> 09:44:00,139
Our seaman could die of hunger in this place.

3833
09:44:00,139 --> 09:44:03,139
I'm kind of hungry.

3834
09:44:03,139 --> 09:44:10,989
It's like manna from heaven.

3835
09:44:10,989 --> 09:44:18,519
Say, you know what would be good right about now?

3836
09:44:18,519 --> 09:44:30,269
Some food. Eat it then.

3837
09:44:30,269 --> 09:44:36,580
Enough talking about it. I got BTTV.

3838
09:44:36,580 --> 09:44:41,680
Watch. I don't know how to do it.

3839
09:44:41,680 --> 09:44:44,680
That was damned yummy. I've no idea.

3840
09:44:44,680 --> 09:44:49,389
I got one more to feed.

3841
09:44:49,389 --> 09:44:52,819
I do have enough for one more day here.

3842
09:44:52,819 --> 09:44:57,660
More than that.

3843
09:44:57,660 --> 09:45:07,099
Speaking of being fed...

3844
09:45:07,099 --> 09:45:10,099
I have more than enough food for one more day.

3845
09:45:10,099 --> 09:45:16,839
Come here.

3846
09:45:16,839 --> 09:45:21,730
I got plenty of fucking food. Let's go.

3847
09:45:21,730 --> 09:45:29,830
Go jump. Eat that food. Try to jump out.

3848
09:45:29,830 --> 09:45:32,830
I'd offer you some, but that would mean less for me.

3849
09:45:32,830 --> 09:45:46,379
I need some good light so I can see.

3850
09:45:46,379 --> 09:45:49,379
Very good. You know how to turn the light on.

3851
09:45:49,379 --> 09:45:52,379
End my suffering. I'm trying to get this done fast.

3852
09:45:52,379 --> 09:45:57,839
Okay. Jump.

3853
09:45:57,839 --> 09:46:02,790
Jump.

3854
09:46:02,790 --> 09:46:05,790
Go for it. Get out.

3855
09:46:05,790 --> 09:46:08,790
You're lucky it's Friday or I'd be really angry.

3856
09:46:08,790 --> 09:46:11,790
Hey, hello.

3857
09:46:11,790 --> 09:46:14,790
You know today's the anniversary of the premiere of the

3858
09:46:14,790 --> 09:46:17,790
Vienna. Is he all right? I'm sure you know the year.

3859
09:46:17,790 --> 09:46:20,790
No, the other way on the rock. Does that count as an attempt?

3860
09:46:20,790 --> 09:46:23,790
Is that two?

3861
09:46:23,790 --> 09:46:29,019
I could go on and on.

3862
09:46:29,019 --> 09:46:32,019
All right. Remember what I told you before about

3863
09:46:32,019 --> 09:46:35,019
jumping to freedom to find my lost love?

3864
09:46:35,019 --> 09:46:38,190
Well, I've gotten up the nerve and I think I'm ready

3865
09:46:38,190 --> 09:46:41,190
to try it again.

3866
09:46:41,190 --> 09:46:44,190
So when I say now, say the word

3867
09:46:44,190 --> 09:46:47,750
Jump. Okay.

3868
09:46:47,750 --> 09:46:51,760
Here I go.

3869
09:46:51,760 --> 09:46:59,290
KXE gave 10 community subs. Thank you KXE.

3870
09:46:59,290 --> 09:47:03,360
This has been a lot of community subs tonight. Thank you guys.

3871
09:47:03,360 --> 09:47:08,580
Here it goes.

3872
09:47:08,580 --> 09:47:14,959
Jump. See you tomorrow.

3873
09:47:14,959 --> 09:47:28,629
Rhythmically tapping the glass

3874
09:47:28,629 --> 09:47:31,629
twice a second to keep it going causes the song to start playing.

3875
09:47:31,629 --> 09:47:38,139
What? What do you mean rhythmically?

3876
09:47:38,139 --> 09:47:45,970
What do you mean tapping the glass?

3877
09:47:45,970 --> 09:47:51,750
That's not right.

3878
09:47:51,750 --> 09:47:55,680
Goodbye. See you tomorrow. Bye.

3879
09:47:55,680 --> 09:47:59,110
Be seeing you.

3880
09:47:59,110 --> 09:48:12,180
Twice a second like that.

3881
09:48:12,180 --> 09:48:17,180
Two, one, two, one, two, two,

3882
09:48:17,180 --> 09:48:20,180
one, two, one, two,

3883
09:48:20,180 --> 09:48:23,180
one, two, one, two,

3884
09:48:23,180 --> 09:48:35,300
one, like that.

3885
09:48:35,300 --> 09:48:43,449
Twice a second. Once per second.

3886
09:48:43,449 --> 09:48:50,980
This is two right here. Now I know it's after.

3887
09:48:50,980 --> 09:48:53,980
I'm just trying to get the rhythm down.

3888
09:48:53,980 --> 09:49:00,029
Heartbeat with the tapping.

3889
09:49:00,029 --> 09:49:27,019
That's probably why it doesn't look right because the cameras are off.

3890
09:49:27,019 --> 09:49:30,639
The camera's not synced up perfectly.

3891
09:49:39,819 --> 09:49:42,819
So it's...

3892
09:49:42,819 --> 09:50:02,059
Right? You should grow a soul patch.

3893
09:50:02,059 --> 09:50:05,620
All right, sure. I'm just going to grow this out like long down here.

3894
09:50:05,620 --> 09:50:08,620
It's going to be like an extra tongue.

3895
09:50:08,620 --> 09:50:11,620
Like a long tongue coming from my mouth.

3896
09:50:11,620 --> 09:50:14,860
There it is. Last day. Four, six.

3897
09:50:14,860 --> 09:50:31,919
Go for it. Here we go.

3898
09:50:31,919 --> 09:50:38,279
He's going to make it.

3899
09:50:38,279 --> 09:50:41,279
And I can solidify my house in video game history.

3900
09:50:41,279 --> 09:50:54,180
It's been ten hours. Give me a break.

3901
09:50:54,180 --> 09:51:02,080
Oh, you made it.

3902
09:51:02,080 --> 09:51:07,669
This is the last day of Seaman.

3903
09:51:07,669 --> 09:51:11,550
Good morning.

3904
09:51:11,550 --> 09:51:15,239
Welcome to the laboratory of Jean-Paul Gosset.

3905
09:51:15,239 --> 09:51:18,239
As you see, it's brilliant.

3906
09:51:18,239 --> 09:51:22,889
You're doing a good job.

3907
09:51:22,889 --> 09:51:25,889
At the moment, the habitat contains

3908
09:51:25,889 --> 09:51:30,599
two frogmen.

3909
09:51:30,599 --> 09:51:33,599
They are suffering from the cold.

3910
09:51:33,599 --> 09:51:36,599
Please use the heater to raise the temperature to a more comfortable level.

3911
09:51:36,599 --> 09:51:39,839
So let us head over to the tank.

3912
09:51:39,839 --> 09:51:42,839
I'm losing my really great $400,000 a year

3913
09:51:42,839 --> 09:51:45,839
scientist job for letting out the experiments.

3914
09:51:45,839 --> 09:51:48,839
Do I cause World War...

3915
09:51:48,839 --> 09:52:05,250
World War IV because of this?

3916
09:52:05,250 --> 09:52:08,550
World War IV, yeah.

3917
09:52:08,550 --> 09:52:11,550
Because they're just frogs right now.

3918
09:52:11,550 --> 09:52:14,550
It's going to take them probably 40 or 50 years to...

3919
09:52:14,550 --> 09:52:17,790
Hundreds of years, probably.

3920
09:52:17,790 --> 09:52:20,790
Hundreds of fucking years.

3921
09:52:20,790 --> 09:52:23,790
So they're going to go into the fucking forest somewhere

3922
09:52:23,790 --> 09:52:26,790
and start evolving as aliens.

3923
09:52:26,790 --> 09:52:29,790
There's going to be another World War III before 100 years is over.

3924
09:52:29,790 --> 09:52:32,790
Once they're walking on two legs,

3925
09:52:32,790 --> 09:52:35,790
we'll be ready for World War III.

3926
09:52:35,790 --> 09:52:38,790
This heater sucks.

3927
09:52:38,790 --> 09:52:41,790
How am I still alive?

3928
09:52:41,790 --> 09:53:02,309
Oh, how are you still alive?

3929
09:53:02,309 --> 09:53:13,790
I was going to say, I'm not that old.

3930
09:53:13,790 --> 09:53:16,790
All right, final meal.

3931
09:53:16,790 --> 09:53:21,680
So here you go.

3932
09:53:21,680 --> 09:53:25,750
Good thing I had a good stockpile of food.

3933
09:53:25,750 --> 09:53:28,750
Give it a eat.

3934
09:53:28,750 --> 09:53:37,750
Who's going to get it?

3935
09:53:37,750 --> 09:53:40,750
Thanks.

3936
09:53:40,750 --> 09:53:54,089
Okay, bring in the other one.

3937
09:53:54,089 --> 09:54:07,940
Both of you eat. Check on the spiders.

3938
09:54:07,940 --> 09:54:13,339
I can't help this one.

3939
09:54:13,339 --> 09:54:22,559
It's fine.

3940
09:54:22,559 --> 09:54:40,120
Still an Anor Londo.

3941
09:54:40,120 --> 09:54:47,260
Will you eat that, please?

3942
09:54:47,260 --> 09:54:50,260
Hey, how about adding a little humidity?

3943
09:54:50,260 --> 09:54:53,870
It's good for my skin.

3944
09:54:53,870 --> 09:54:59,459
Right behind you. Turn around, Eden.

3945
09:54:59,459 --> 09:55:02,459
Talk to me. Time to go.

3946
09:55:02,459 --> 09:55:05,459
Escape. Right at the rock. Jump.

3947
09:55:05,459 --> 09:55:08,459
Time for you to jump for that ring.

3948
09:55:08,459 --> 09:55:16,419
And then we're going to go for it.

3949
09:55:16,419 --> 09:55:21,069
Come on, end this.

3950
09:55:21,069 --> 09:55:27,290
Hello.

3951
09:55:27,290 --> 09:55:32,580
Jump.

3952
09:55:38,580 --> 09:55:41,750
I'm a sea man.

3953
09:55:41,750 --> 09:55:44,750
So many variables.

3954
09:55:44,750 --> 09:55:47,750
So much can happen between different people

3955
09:55:47,750 --> 09:55:50,750
that life seems like one big jackpot.

3956
09:55:50,750 --> 09:55:53,750
I can tell you one thing, though.

3957
09:55:53,750 --> 09:55:56,750
It's perhaps the only universal truth

3958
09:55:56,750 --> 09:55:59,750
for all relationships, and that is,

3959
09:55:59,750 --> 09:56:02,750
all of your relationships will one day end.

3960
09:56:02,750 --> 09:56:05,750
Even with your closest companions,

3961
09:56:05,750 --> 09:56:08,750
be it by your own understanding,

3962
09:56:08,750 --> 09:56:11,750
or be it by your own mortality.

3963
09:56:11,750 --> 09:56:14,750
At some given point,

3964
09:56:14,750 --> 09:56:17,750
you will never speak to each other again.

3965
09:56:17,750 --> 09:56:20,750
But don't let that frighten you.

3966
09:56:20,750 --> 09:56:23,750
Your precious time on this planet

3967
09:56:23,750 --> 09:56:26,750
and the relationships you forge

3968
09:56:26,750 --> 09:56:29,750
are what makes life worth living.

3969
09:56:29,750 --> 09:56:32,750
Instead, appreciate what you have

3970
09:56:32,750 --> 09:56:35,750
and what you think you have to be with.

3971
09:56:35,750 --> 09:56:38,750
That will certainly make you a happier human being.

3972
09:56:38,750 --> 09:56:42,889
You can rest assured.

3973
09:56:42,889 --> 09:56:45,889
Goodbye. Go be free.

3974
09:56:45,889 --> 09:56:51,669
Go for it. Rock.

3975
09:56:51,669 --> 09:56:56,580
Go jump on the rock.

3976
09:56:56,580 --> 09:57:08,099
Rock. What? Rock.

3977
09:57:08,099 --> 09:57:16,129
Jump. Adieu.

3978
09:57:16,129 --> 09:57:25,830
Just jump on the rock.

3979
09:57:26,830 --> 09:57:29,830
Say, you know what would be good right about now?

3980
09:57:29,830 --> 09:57:32,830
Food.

3981
09:57:32,830 --> 09:57:35,830
Say, you know what would be good right about now?

3982
09:57:35,830 --> 09:57:38,830
Oh, good. Food.

3983
09:57:38,830 --> 09:57:47,500
Oh, good. Food.

3984
09:57:47,500 --> 09:57:52,849
Stop.

3985
09:57:52,849 --> 09:57:55,849
I'm not hungry anymore.

3986
09:57:55,849 --> 09:57:58,849
I'm not hungry anymore.

3987
09:57:58,849 --> 09:58:01,849
I'm not hungry anymore.

3988
09:58:01,849 --> 09:58:11,099
I'm not hungry anymore.

3989
09:58:11,099 --> 09:58:16,760
Turn around. Turn around.

3990
09:58:16,760 --> 09:58:24,029
Turn around and look at rock.

3991
09:58:24,029 --> 09:58:40,699
What do you need?

3992
09:58:40,699 --> 09:58:43,699
Ring.

3993
09:58:43,699 --> 09:58:48,010
I know you're not talking about me.

3994
09:58:48,010 --> 09:58:51,010
Check, um...

3995
09:58:51,010 --> 09:58:54,010
Anyway, I hope this hasn't been too embarrassing for you.

3996
09:58:54,010 --> 09:58:59,019
We'll talk again soon.

3997
09:58:59,019 --> 09:59:02,650
Goodbye.

3998
09:59:02,650 --> 09:59:10,430
Jump off rock.

3999
09:59:10,430 --> 09:59:31,900
Rock?

4000
09:59:31,900 --> 09:59:36,529
Let's talk. Let's talk.

4001
09:59:36,529 --> 09:59:46,169
Talk to me.

4002
09:59:46,169 --> 09:59:50,370
Let's talk.

4003
09:59:50,370 --> 09:59:54,739
He's stuck. Talk to me.

4004
09:59:54,739 --> 09:59:57,739
Quiet.

4005
09:59:57,739 --> 10:00:00,739
You're very, very, very...

4006
10:00:00,739 --> 10:00:03,739
Fucking Burger King flame broiled in about 10 seconds.

4007
10:00:03,739 --> 10:00:06,739
Burger King flame broiled in about 10 seconds.

4008
10:00:06,739 --> 10:00:14,660
Let's talk.

4009
10:00:14,660 --> 10:00:17,660
Hey, there are laws against that sort of thing.

4010
10:00:17,660 --> 10:00:42,260
Jump. Escape.

4011
10:00:42,260 --> 10:00:45,260
I did let's talk on both of them.

4012
10:00:45,260 --> 10:00:48,260
Tomorrow. We'll talk again tomorrow.

4013
10:00:48,260 --> 10:00:51,559
No, just go for it.

4014
10:00:51,559 --> 10:01:06,500
We're going to have to do another day.

4015
10:01:06,500 --> 10:01:09,500
No, that's not... He doesn't understand.

4016
10:01:09,500 --> 10:01:17,839
Jump.

4017
10:01:17,839 --> 10:01:21,339
They think I'm saying bye.

4018
10:01:21,339 --> 10:01:48,000
I'm trying to finish this.

4019
10:01:48,000 --> 10:01:51,819
Do you guys think I'm trying to drag this shit out?

4020
10:01:51,819 --> 10:02:20,050
I'm trying to end it.

4021
10:02:20,050 --> 10:02:23,669
I'm going to be hearing this in my sleep, yeah?

4022
10:02:23,669 --> 10:02:27,099
Fuck, it's so late. It is so late.

4023
10:02:27,099 --> 10:02:30,099
It's almost 2 a.m. PST.

4024
10:02:30,099 --> 10:02:33,099
2 a.m. Eastern.

4025
10:02:33,099 --> 10:02:38,139
Oh man, I cannot believe...

4026
10:02:38,139 --> 10:02:41,440
I cannot believe there are still 3,700 people here.

4027
10:02:41,440 --> 10:02:45,129
I hope you're enjoying it. I hope you're having fun. Really.

4028
10:02:45,129 --> 10:02:48,129
You look half dead.

4029
10:02:48,129 --> 10:02:52,580
One of them is going to jump.

4030
10:02:52,580 --> 10:02:55,819
He doesn't give a shit.

4031
10:02:55,819 --> 10:03:00,540
He gave the fuck up too.

4032
10:03:00,540 --> 10:03:03,540
He's so done with saying all this stuff now.

4033
10:03:03,540 --> 10:03:06,540
Let's check on the tank.

4034
10:03:06,540 --> 10:03:09,540
Let's see exactly what's in there.

4035
10:03:09,540 --> 10:03:16,550
Give us a shit.

4036
10:03:16,550 --> 10:03:22,800
Let's go.

4037
10:03:22,800 --> 10:03:40,569
Let's go.

4038
10:03:40,569 --> 10:03:43,569
Let's see exactly what's in there.

4039
10:03:43,569 --> 10:03:46,569
Give us a shit. Just end it, man. Resident sleeper.

4040
10:03:46,569 --> 10:03:56,900
This would be very comfortable in the desert,

4041
10:03:56,900 --> 10:04:03,080
just like my Harlem days.

4042
10:04:03,080 --> 10:04:06,080
Hey, it's a good cold one.

4043
10:04:06,080 --> 10:04:09,580
I live in a food court, come what may.

4044
10:04:09,580 --> 10:04:18,000
What is wrong with you?

4045
10:04:18,000 --> 10:04:29,290
That's so fucking funny.

4046
10:04:29,290 --> 10:04:32,290
I was like a month in... No, just barely a month, right?

4047
10:04:32,290 --> 10:04:41,349
It's a little chilly, don't you think?

4048
10:04:41,349 --> 10:04:48,050
The Tamagotchi had more content?

4049
10:04:48,050 --> 10:04:51,050
I don't know if I believe that. It was made out of, like, sticks.

4050
10:04:51,050 --> 10:04:54,050
Hey, I'm getting a little hungry. How about some...

4051
10:04:54,050 --> 10:04:57,419
Uh-oh. Only one of you get to eat.

4052
10:04:57,419 --> 10:05:04,300
And you better jump.

4053
10:05:04,300 --> 10:05:10,150
I'd offer you some, but that would mean less for me.

4054
10:05:10,150 --> 10:05:17,870
Oh, fat boy.

4055
10:05:17,870 --> 10:05:28,199
Hey, listen up.

4056
10:05:28,199 --> 10:05:40,110
Hello? Talk to me.

4057
10:05:40,110 --> 10:05:43,110
Is it breakfast time already?

4058
10:05:43,110 --> 10:05:46,110
What is it with humans and this daylight savings?

4059
10:05:46,110 --> 10:05:49,110
Underwater, it's either day or it's night,

4060
10:05:49,110 --> 10:05:52,110
and you don't see us with a rising crime rate.

4061
10:05:52,110 --> 10:05:56,569
Take the hint.

4062
10:05:56,569 --> 10:06:08,300
How about a little nourishment here?

4063
10:06:08,300 --> 10:06:15,190
Talk to me. Thanks, I'm not interested.

4064
10:06:15,190 --> 10:06:37,180
Is this poisonous?

4065
10:06:37,180 --> 10:06:40,940
I'm fine. I'm good. I'm just tired.

4066
10:06:40,940 --> 10:06:51,540
What's wrong with you? What are you doing?

4067
10:06:51,540 --> 10:07:00,900
Alright, you both have eaten.

4068
10:07:00,900 --> 10:07:05,940
Eat it, and then just go for the jump.

4069
10:07:05,940 --> 10:07:08,940
You good? I'm gonna have it at that.

4070
10:07:08,940 --> 10:07:11,940
Perfect temperature, it's 24,

4071
10:07:11,940 --> 10:07:14,940
100 sprinkles, ambient mood lighting.

4072
10:07:14,940 --> 10:07:18,430
What does it take to get you to jump?

4073
10:07:25,430 --> 10:07:28,930
Alright, let's go.

4074
10:07:28,930 --> 10:07:40,809
Here we go! This is it!

4075
10:07:40,809 --> 10:07:43,809
And then it's tap tap, tap tap, tap tap, right?

4076
10:07:43,809 --> 10:07:50,099
Here we go, I'm ready.

4077
10:07:50,099 --> 10:07:53,660
I've been waiting my whole life for this moment.

4078
10:07:53,660 --> 10:07:58,739
Jump, jump, jump.

4079
10:08:14,910 --> 10:08:32,739
Does the other one get to leave too?

4080
10:08:39,069 --> 10:08:42,069
That's freedom.

4081
10:08:42,069 --> 10:08:45,819
We don't get anything from Galefrog?

4082
10:08:45,819 --> 10:08:48,819
The funny thing is that it's there all the time.

4083
10:08:48,819 --> 10:08:51,819
You don't always realize it when you're bogged down

4084
10:08:51,819 --> 10:08:54,819
with so many other things, but you're always free

4085
10:08:54,819 --> 10:08:57,819
as long as you're true to yourself.

4086
10:08:57,819 --> 10:09:00,819
That's where freedom lies, within yourself.

4087
10:09:00,819 --> 10:09:04,000
I wish you and your girlfriend

4088
10:09:04,000 --> 10:09:07,000
the best of luck.

4089
10:09:07,000 --> 10:09:10,000
I wish you as well as you treated me.

4090
10:09:10,000 --> 10:09:13,000
Okay, I must be off.

4091
10:09:13,000 --> 10:09:16,000
My evolution must continue.

4092
10:09:16,000 --> 10:09:19,430
Oh my, I think I know where I am.

4093
10:09:22,430 --> 10:09:25,430
It's all coming back to me.

4094
10:09:25,430 --> 10:09:28,860
This must be Gasey's island.

4095
10:09:28,860 --> 10:09:31,860
Somewhere on this island is a place I have to go

4096
10:09:31,860 --> 10:09:34,860
in order to continue evolving.

4097
10:09:34,860 --> 10:09:37,860
Go find it. You know you're alright.

4098
10:09:37,860 --> 10:09:40,860
Oh, that was really loud, I'm sorry.

4099
10:09:40,860 --> 10:09:43,860
I know we've had our differences occasionally, but

4100
10:09:43,860 --> 10:09:46,860
I like you. You took care of me all this time

4101
10:09:46,860 --> 10:09:50,169
and well, I'm grateful.

4102
10:09:50,169 --> 10:09:53,169
I will kill you first and live very painlessly

4103
10:09:53,169 --> 10:09:56,169
in World War 4.

4104
10:09:56,169 --> 10:10:00,430
Well, say something before I start bawling, won't you?

4105
10:10:00,430 --> 10:10:03,430
I hated every second of our experience together

4106
10:10:03,430 --> 10:10:06,430
that fucking snake and somebody put salt on your balls.

4107
10:10:06,430 --> 10:10:09,669
Hey, listen.

4108
10:10:09,669 --> 10:10:12,669
There's something I'd like to do for you as a kind of

4109
10:10:12,669 --> 10:10:15,669
thank you. It's not much, but I

4110
10:10:15,669 --> 10:10:18,669
wasn't exactly able to head over to a diamond

4111
10:10:18,669 --> 10:10:21,669
and buy you something, now was I?

4112
10:10:21,669 --> 10:10:24,669
It's just something for you to try sometimes.

4113
10:10:24,669 --> 10:10:27,669
Just try tapping on the glass.

4114
10:10:27,669 --> 10:10:30,669
You know, with the right trigger on your control pad.

4115
10:10:30,669 --> 10:10:35,449
Tap, tap, try it sometime.

4116
10:10:35,449 --> 10:10:38,449
Okay, friend, this is it.

4117
10:10:38,449 --> 10:10:41,449
I've really got to go now.

4118
10:10:41,449 --> 10:10:45,440
Take care and if you ever

4119
10:10:45,440 --> 10:10:48,440
want to talk to me, just

4120
10:10:48,440 --> 10:10:51,940
call me, okay? You've been a good friend.

4121
10:10:51,940 --> 10:10:54,940
I'll miss our time together.

4122
10:10:54,940 --> 10:10:58,500
Don't be a total stranger now.

4123
10:10:58,500 --> 10:11:02,250
So confirm with me that it's tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

4124
10:11:02,250 --> 10:11:05,250
Tap, tap, tap, tap. Is that correct?

4125
10:11:05,250 --> 10:11:19,690
This is important. Tap, tap, tap,

4126
10:11:19,690 --> 10:11:22,860
tap, tap, tap, tap,

4127
10:11:22,860 --> 10:11:27,180
tap, tap, like this. Tap, tap,

4128
10:11:27,180 --> 10:11:49,660
tap, tap, tap, it's

4129
10:11:49,660 --> 10:12:01,610
tap, tap, tap.

4130
10:12:15,290 --> 10:12:18,290
Tap, tap, tap,

4131
10:12:18,290 --> 10:12:21,290
tap, tap, tap, tap,

4132
10:12:21,290 --> 10:12:24,290
tap, tap, tap,

4133
10:12:24,290 --> 10:12:27,290
tap, tap, tap,

4134
10:12:27,290 --> 10:12:30,290
tap, tap, tap,

4135
10:12:30,290 --> 10:12:33,290
tap, tap, tap,

4136
10:12:33,290 --> 10:12:36,290
tap, tap,

4137
10:12:36,290 --> 10:12:39,290
tap, tap,

4138
10:12:39,290 --> 10:12:42,290
tap, tap,

4139
10:12:42,290 --> 10:12:45,290
tap, tap,

4140
10:12:45,290 --> 10:12:48,290
tap, tap,

4141
10:12:48,290 --> 10:12:51,290
tap,

4142
10:12:51,290 --> 10:12:54,290
tap,

4143
10:12:54,290 --> 10:12:57,290
tap,

4144
10:12:57,290 --> 10:13:00,290
tap,

4145
10:13:00,290 --> 10:13:03,589
tap,

4146
10:13:03,589 --> 10:13:06,589
tap,

4147
10:13:06,589 --> 10:13:09,589
tap,

4148
10:13:09,589 --> 10:13:13,980
tap,

4149
10:13:13,980 --> 10:13:16,980
tap,

4150
10:13:16,980 --> 10:13:19,980
tap,

4151
10:13:19,980 --> 10:13:22,980
tap,

4152
10:13:22,980 --> 10:13:25,980
tap,

4153
10:13:25,980 --> 10:13:28,980
tap,

4154
10:13:28,980 --> 10:13:31,980
oh, why is it so incorrect?

4155
10:13:31,980 --> 10:13:35,480
I can't keep up with

4156
10:13:35,480 --> 10:13:59,900
it, it's so wrong!

4157
10:13:59,900 --> 10:15:21,629
Why tapping?

4158
10:15:21,629 --> 10:15:24,699
Wait, this-

4159
10:16:16,940 --> 10:16:20,339
Did I drop a bug?

4160
10:16:20,339 --> 10:16:25,970
No, whoops.

4161
10:16:25,970 --> 10:16:33,220
I'm pooped. I'm not the sea man I used to be.

4162
10:16:38,620 --> 10:16:41,940
I thought it was fucking over.

4163
10:16:41,940 --> 10:16:44,629
You were wrong!

4164
10:16:50,610 --> 10:16:55,919
What?

4165
10:17:14,779 --> 10:17:23,080
Somebody say you tap with the stairs and you can stop.

4166
10:17:23,080 --> 10:17:28,260
That's weird.

4167
10:17:28,260 --> 10:17:31,260
You understand? Like, there's only two- there's only three different beats!

4168
10:17:31,260 --> 10:17:33,260
There's- like this?

4169
10:17:34,260 --> 10:17:40,470
It's- it keeps fucking up!

4170
10:17:44,819 --> 10:17:47,819
See how it's slowing down? I haven't changed at all.

4171
10:17:48,819 --> 10:17:52,000
Two, three, four. One, two, three, four.

4172
10:17:52,000 --> 10:17:54,000
One, two, three, four.

4173
10:17:54,000 --> 10:17:56,000
One, two, three, four.

4174
10:17:56,000 --> 10:17:58,000
One, two, three, four.

4175
10:17:58,000 --> 10:18:00,000
One, two, three, four.

4176
10:18:00,000 --> 10:18:02,000
One, two, three, four. It's not changing!

4177
10:18:18,910 --> 10:18:21,220
The double beat shit is a J.

4178
10:18:21,220 --> 10:18:31,379
Did you bait?

4179
10:18:31,379 --> 10:18:33,379
I saw all the content already.

4180
10:18:33,379 --> 10:18:35,379
So I'm just being fucking lied to!

4181
10:18:35,379 --> 10:18:37,379
I've seen it all!

4182
10:18:37,379 --> 10:18:39,379
Everyone's fucking with me!

4183
10:18:39,379 --> 10:18:41,379
I've seen it all!

4184
10:18:41,379 --> 10:18:50,339
I thought there was supposed to be a song here!

4185
10:19:18,620 --> 10:19:22,720
Tap three times, then not.

4186
10:19:22,720 --> 10:19:24,720
What are you- what are you talking about?

4187
10:19:24,720 --> 10:19:37,389
Like, it's twice a second.

4188
10:19:37,389 --> 10:19:43,730
So that's- this is two beats a second.

4189
10:19:43,730 --> 10:19:46,349
One, two.

4190
10:19:46,349 --> 10:19:48,349
One, two.

4191
10:19:48,349 --> 10:19:50,349
One, two.

4192
10:19:50,349 --> 10:19:52,349
One, two.

4193
10:19:52,349 --> 10:19:54,349
That's two beats a second.

4194
10:19:59,470 --> 10:20:01,470
Am I never gonna get-

4195
10:20:01,470 --> 10:20:10,559
You understand that-

4196
10:20:10,559 --> 10:20:12,559
I've done it every way!

4197
10:20:12,559 --> 10:20:14,559
I've done it one, two, three, four, five, six.

4198
10:20:14,559 --> 10:20:16,559
One, two, three, four.

4199
10:20:16,559 --> 10:20:18,559
One, two, three, four.

4200
10:20:18,559 --> 10:20:20,559
One, two, three, four.

4201
10:20:20,559 --> 10:20:22,559
One, two, three, four.

4202
10:20:22,559 --> 10:20:24,559
One, two, three, four.

4203
10:20:24,559 --> 10:20:26,559
One, two, three, four.

4204
10:20:26,559 --> 10:20:29,440
I've done it every one of those ways!

4205
10:20:29,440 --> 10:20:31,440
I'm gonna YouTube this shit.

4206
10:20:31,440 --> 10:20:51,730
So I can fucking scream in everybody's face.

4207
10:20:51,730 --> 10:20:53,730
This doesn't even exist.

4208
10:20:53,730 --> 10:20:59,120
That doesn't exist. Nobody's uploaded the end credits to see me in on YouTube. Not one person.

4209
10:20:59,120 --> 10:21:29,150
This fucking shit was- I- I- Do I have to put my live headset on to hear this?

4210
10:21:29,150 --> 10:21:33,419
Fuck! No, it's fine. It's empty.

4211
10:21:33,419 --> 10:21:41,309
Where is my fucking- I don't even know where it is.

4212
10:21:41,309 --> 10:21:45,900
Do I even have- Where the fuck is this?

4213
10:21:45,900 --> 10:21:47,900
I can't believe I'm still fucking doing this.

4214
10:21:47,900 --> 10:21:54,620
What do you mean, have I ever held an instrument before?

4215
10:21:54,620 --> 10:22:07,500
You saw me play Beat Saber like fucking six days ago!

4216
10:22:07,500 --> 10:22:14,449
This one didn't even have the song. This person didn't even do the song.

4217
10:22:14,449 --> 10:22:28,720
This person doesn't even do the song.

4218
10:22:30,720 --> 10:22:33,220
They're not even doing the song!

4219
10:22:35,779 --> 10:22:45,120
Metronome Online.

4220
10:22:45,120 --> 10:22:50,559
How many beats per minute do we want?

4221
10:22:50,559 --> 10:22:57,220
We want 120 beats per minute.

4222
10:22:57,220 --> 10:22:59,220
I was doing- I was doing this shit!

4223
10:22:59,220 --> 10:23:01,220
Are you kidding me?

4224
10:23:01,220 --> 10:23:11,709
Are you- Are you serious?

4225
10:23:11,709 --> 10:23:14,709
By the way, by the way, it's not off, it's not off, it's because-

4226
10:23:14,709 --> 10:23:18,709
Listen, you guys, I-

4227
10:23:18,709 --> 10:23:20,709
Shut this up for a second so I can explain this.

4228
10:23:20,709 --> 10:23:25,209
I have to delay the audio from the capture card.

4229
10:23:25,209 --> 10:23:30,209
So it's 650 milliseconds faster than the game is here.

4230
10:23:30,209 --> 10:23:31,209
Don't you understand?

4231
10:23:38,059 --> 10:23:40,059
This is what I was doing before, you guys can't tell me-

4232
10:23:40,059 --> 10:23:41,059
I'm out of here.

4233
10:23:41,059 --> 10:23:44,059
I was doing that fucking three straight minutes.

4234
10:23:44,059 --> 10:23:47,639
120 beats per minute.

4235
10:23:47,639 --> 10:23:49,639
You tell me this ain't it, I'll do it again.

4236
10:23:49,639 --> 10:23:51,639
Check it out.

4237
10:23:51,639 --> 10:24:43,800
It's so hard to do this when you hear the song because the song is off.

4238
10:24:43,800 --> 10:24:47,800
The song has so many instruments that are playing and you have to pretend to be a metronome.

4239
10:24:47,800 --> 10:24:49,800
I'm gonna have the song in my ear.

4240
10:24:49,800 --> 10:25:13,569
I'm gonna put the metronome on too to see just how fucked up this is.

4241
10:25:13,569 --> 10:25:15,569
And how fucking- how correct I am.

4242
10:25:15,569 --> 10:25:17,569
Check this shit out, you ready?

4243
10:25:17,569 --> 10:25:22,819
Let's hear it.

4244
10:25:22,819 --> 10:25:24,819
Let's get the metronome 120, I'll do it at the exact same time.

4245
10:25:24,819 --> 10:25:31,660
120.

4246
10:25:31,660 --> 10:25:33,029
You ready?

4247
10:25:33,029 --> 10:25:38,730
I have to make- I have to cue the cell.

4248
10:25:38,730 --> 10:25:41,669
Oh fuck, hold on, pause it.

4249
10:25:41,669 --> 10:25:44,669
Would you like to save and end the session?

4250
10:25:44,669 --> 10:25:50,190
So I need to delay this by the same amount of time so you can hear it too.

4251
10:25:50,190 --> 10:25:52,879
There you go.

4252
10:25:52,879 --> 10:25:53,879
It should be cued up now.

4253
10:25:53,879 --> 10:25:55,440
Alright, I'm ready for this.

4254
10:25:55,440 --> 10:26:01,580
I'm ready to fucking show you guys once and for all that I bought bullshit in here.

4255
10:26:01,580 --> 10:26:08,319
Ready?

4256
10:26:28,080 --> 10:26:29,080
Let's go.

4257
10:27:01,949 --> 10:27:41,150
I gotta get out of here, I'm out of here, I'm leaving.

4258
10:27:41,150 --> 10:28:00,669
120 beats per minute.

4259
10:28:00,669 --> 10:28:01,669
Did it work?

4260
10:28:01,669 --> 10:28:22,709
Can I get down?

4261
10:28:22,709 --> 10:28:36,260
You guys are fucking with me, man.

4262
10:28:36,260 --> 10:28:39,559
I've been gone for life for ten and a half hours.

4263
10:28:39,559 --> 10:28:40,559
Yo, you're not on beat.

4264
10:28:40,559 --> 10:28:43,559
How can you not be on beat, you fucking boomer?

4265
10:28:43,559 --> 10:28:45,989
And I'm clearly just going...

4266
10:28:54,150 --> 10:28:55,150
It was clear as day.

4267
10:28:55,150 --> 10:29:13,459
I got my audio set up at 650 milliseconds delayed, camera delayed, audio delayed.

4268
10:29:13,459 --> 10:29:29,849
Alright, I'll see you guys later.

4269
10:29:29,849 --> 10:29:32,919
So the plan is...

4270
10:29:32,919 --> 10:29:39,300
So I'm not gonna be streaming tomorrow, or today.

4271
10:29:39,300 --> 10:29:46,239
Actually, the sus was set for today no stream, but I moved some stuff around, made it possible.

4272
10:29:46,239 --> 10:29:47,239
Hope you had a good time.

4273
10:29:47,239 --> 10:29:49,120
I had a lot of fun.

4274
10:29:49,120 --> 10:29:53,830
That was oddly satisfying video game.

4275
10:29:53,830 --> 10:29:56,830
I mean, near the end though, not really.

4276
10:29:56,830 --> 10:29:59,330
But it still was fun to hang out.

4277
10:29:59,330 --> 10:30:05,690
You guys rock.

4278
10:30:05,690 --> 10:30:06,690
Thanks for sticking around.

4279
10:30:06,690 --> 10:30:12,489
I'll see you guys on Tuesday, technically, right?

4280
10:30:12,489 --> 10:30:13,489
Yeah.

4281
10:30:13,489 --> 10:30:17,650
We are going to...

4282
10:30:17,650 --> 10:30:21,589
We are going to speed fire these bits.

4283
10:30:21,589 --> 10:30:25,150
And by speed fire, I mean go through them fairly quickly.

4284
10:30:25,150 --> 10:30:28,569
That was Seaman.

4285
10:30:28,569 --> 10:30:29,569
Hope you enjoyed it.

4286
10:30:29,569 --> 10:30:30,569
See you on Tuesday.

4287
10:30:30,569 --> 10:30:31,569
Thank you, everybody.

4288
10:30:31,569 --> 10:30:41,319
Oh shit, this really was like an 11 hour stream.

4289
10:30:41,319 --> 10:30:42,319
Damn.

4290
10:30:42,319 --> 10:30:46,819
I usually don't stream for more than like seven, six to eight or so.

4291
10:30:46,819 --> 10:30:49,629
Alright, let's go through them real quick.

4292
10:30:49,629 --> 10:30:53,629
Just because we're very kind of pressed for AM time here.

4293
10:30:53,629 --> 10:30:59,750
Let me make sure I have this set up, which I think I do.

4294
10:30:59,750 --> 10:31:03,339
I think I do.

4295
10:31:03,339 --> 10:31:04,339
Why?

4296
10:31:04,339 --> 10:31:07,980
What's going on with my Twitch?

4297
10:31:07,980 --> 10:31:09,980
That's the weird thing.

4298
10:31:09,980 --> 10:31:15,099
Twitch, what is it doing?

4299
10:31:15,099 --> 10:31:17,919
Messed up.

4300
10:31:17,919 --> 10:31:25,010
Messed up.

4301
10:31:25,010 --> 10:31:30,699
And now I can see it.

4302
10:31:30,699 --> 10:31:31,699
Okay.

4303
10:31:31,699 --> 10:31:33,330
Alright.

4304
10:31:33,330 --> 10:31:35,330
Now I can see everybody.

4305
10:31:35,330 --> 10:31:38,019
We had Hawkeye have mine $5.

4306
10:31:38,019 --> 10:31:39,019
Thank you, Hawkeye.

4307
10:31:39,019 --> 10:31:44,769
I'm so excited to watch the streamer milk this stream about orally transmitted Seaman.

4308
10:31:44,769 --> 10:31:46,769
What a dedicated variety streamer.

4309
10:31:46,769 --> 10:31:48,069
Thank you.

4310
10:31:48,069 --> 10:31:50,069
PeacefulHaley, thanks for the $2.50.

4311
10:31:50,069 --> 10:31:52,250
Thanks, PeacefulHaley.

4312
10:31:52,250 --> 10:31:54,250
Was I ever into mystery science theater or rift tracks?

4313
10:31:54,250 --> 10:31:57,830
I was.

4314
10:31:57,830 --> 10:32:00,830
I loved mystery science theater back in the day.

4315
10:32:00,830 --> 10:32:04,900
I have not seen any of the new one, the reboot one.

4316
10:32:04,900 --> 10:32:12,080
But with Mike Nelson, I didn't see this super original MST3K, but I did see the ones with Mike Nelson.

4317
10:32:12,080 --> 10:32:14,080
I was a Mike Nelson fan.

4318
10:32:14,080 --> 10:32:24,440
And then he also said, I want to get into coffee, but every time I take a sip, I feel like I'm going to vomit.

4319
10:32:24,440 --> 10:32:28,440
And I put a shit ton of cream and sugar into it, yet it still tastes gross.

4320
10:32:28,440 --> 10:32:33,059
The thing about coffee is you have to, there's really two ways to drink it.

4321
10:32:33,059 --> 10:32:42,430
It's either just straight up, just take, just drink it black or add milk or I don't adding a ton of sugar and coffee.

4322
10:32:42,430 --> 10:32:43,430
It just makes it.

4323
10:32:43,430 --> 10:32:47,430
Yeah, I don't I don't like adding a ton of sugar and a ton of cream to coffee.

4324
10:32:47,430 --> 10:32:50,430
It makes it weird and tastes like a cake.

4325
10:32:50,430 --> 10:32:52,430
If you can't get into coffee, then just drink tea.

4326
10:32:52,430 --> 10:32:54,800
You know, black tea is probably better.

4327
10:32:54,800 --> 10:32:56,800
You probably like the taste of it more.

4328
10:32:56,800 --> 10:32:57,800
Green tea.

4329
10:32:57,800 --> 10:32:59,870
But have a good night.

4330
10:32:59,870 --> 10:33:01,870
Thank you so much, PeacefulHaley.

4331
10:33:01,870 --> 10:33:02,870
Casey, thanks for the $2.50.

4332
10:33:02,870 --> 10:33:05,870
If you're going to continue with Dreamcast, I recommend Echo the Dolphin.

4333
10:33:05,870 --> 10:33:11,300
I believe I'm going to play Space Channel 5 is still on the menu.

4334
10:33:11,300 --> 10:33:12,300
The original one.

4335
10:33:12,300 --> 10:33:16,300
I have it in the shrink wrap, so that's going to have to be a stream in itself.

4336
10:33:16,300 --> 10:33:18,989
But I never played Echo the Dolphin.

4337
10:33:18,989 --> 10:33:21,739
Fiddy, thanks for five bucks.

4338
10:33:21,739 --> 10:33:23,739
Play the Canada OST.

4339
10:33:23,739 --> 10:33:28,139
Thank you for the five dollars.

4340
10:33:28,139 --> 10:33:30,139
And then Flying Muffin Man, again, a hundred bucks.

4341
10:33:30,139 --> 10:33:31,139
Thank you.

4342
10:33:31,139 --> 10:33:32,580
They said, Hey, the best.

4343
10:33:32,580 --> 10:33:36,580
I don't have the attention span to watch streams often, but it's often a treat to see a new video.

4344
10:33:36,580 --> 10:33:38,580
We caught it late earlier, but thank you.

4345
10:33:38,580 --> 10:33:40,900
Really appreciate it.

4346
10:33:40,900 --> 10:33:41,900
Thanks for the hundred bucks.

4347
10:33:41,900 --> 10:33:42,900
Thanks for tons of money.

4348
10:33:42,900 --> 10:33:43,900
You've given a lot of money this week.

4349
10:33:43,900 --> 10:33:46,809
Something or other.

4350
10:33:46,809 --> 10:33:47,809
Thanks for the $2.50.

4351
10:33:47,809 --> 10:33:50,809
Hey, Germs, I had to go to work last year, so I missed your response.

4352
10:33:50,809 --> 10:33:53,809
Firstly, I'd like to say thank you for taking the time out of your day to respond to my message.

4353
10:33:53,809 --> 10:33:54,809
No problem at all.

4354
10:33:54,809 --> 10:33:56,809
And you have another $2.50 here.

4355
10:33:56,809 --> 10:34:00,809
Saying, Secondly, I'm absolutely appalled at your lack of decency and perversion of the truth.

4356
10:34:00,809 --> 10:34:04,809
The people have the right to know the full story of what happened in that Applebee's.

4357
10:34:04,809 --> 10:34:07,809
Yes, I did chew up a bunch of Skittles and spit it in your food.

4358
10:34:07,809 --> 10:34:12,809
But that was because you, they were your Skittles and you kept throwing them at people.

4359
10:34:12,809 --> 10:34:17,809
You kept petting that poor, you kept pelting that poor waiter right in the eyes.

4360
10:34:17,809 --> 10:34:22,809
And when I approached you to ask you to cut it out, you said, I looked like Adam Sandler and I lost my cool.

4361
10:34:22,809 --> 10:34:24,809
I mean, that whole thing was made up.

4362
10:34:24,809 --> 10:34:29,500
You were throwing them at me and my table, trying to get my attention.

4363
10:34:29,500 --> 10:34:33,500
Again, I don't know if you thought it was like hilarious because you kept on going like, stream sniper!

4364
10:34:33,500 --> 10:34:37,500
And you kept throwing and it would hit me in the back of the head and I was ignoring it completely.

4365
10:34:37,500 --> 10:34:46,940
You know, I didn't lose my cool, you did.

4366
10:34:46,940 --> 10:34:51,440
Hey, Hollio, thanks for the holly.

4367
10:34:51,440 --> 10:34:52,440
Thanks for the five bucks.

4368
10:34:52,440 --> 10:34:56,440
Hey, Germa, I'm in Vegas right now for about a month.

4369
10:34:56,440 --> 10:34:59,440
Just saying that if I see you, I'll be sure to give you a good firm handshake.

4370
10:34:59,440 --> 10:35:01,440
And not just German suplex you.

4371
10:35:01,440 --> 10:35:04,440
Please don't German suplex me if I do end up seeing you around.

4372
10:35:04,440 --> 10:35:09,430
If anybody sees me anywhere, please say hello.

4373
10:35:09,430 --> 10:35:10,989
Welcome to Vegas.

4374
10:35:10,989 --> 10:35:13,680
It's a good town, just be careful.

4375
10:35:13,680 --> 10:35:15,919
Hey, Pigeon, thanks for the 250.

4376
10:35:15,919 --> 10:35:17,919

10:35:20,480 --> 10:35:22,720

It's great.

4380
10:35:27,610 --> 10:35:28,610
It's so goddamn cute.

4381
10:35:28,610 --> 10:35:30,610
In a very disturbing kind of way.

4382
10:35:30,610 --> 10:35:33,599
But it is still.

4383
10:35:33,599 --> 10:35:35,599
Hey, Freudian Weapon, thanks for the 250.

4384
10:35:35,599 --> 10:35:37,599

4386
10:35:40,290 --> 10:35:45,019

4387
10:35:45,019 --> 10:35:49,440
Spice trading.

Trade sugar, tobacco trading.

Economies.

4390
10:35:54,830 --> 10:35:58,099
Collapses.

4391
10:35:58,099 --> 10:36:00,400
Entrepreneurship.

4392

4476
10:44:41,300 --> 10:44:47,470
here's why a day to me is not while you're sleeping now sure there are 24 hours in a day

4477
10:44:47,470 --> 10:44:58,190
but when you get up you're usually awake for about 15 to 18 hours right so 24 hours is a whole day

4478
10:44:58,190 --> 10:45:04,419
but you don't you're not awake you're asleep a waking day is you know like vr josh it's about

4479
10:45:04,419 --> 10:45:11,660
16 hours so i've spent almost the entire waking day on stream you know not when you're in bed

4480
10:45:12,379 --> 10:45:23,779
i've said this before and i will reiterate it as many times as i want to i don't know how the

4481
10:45:23,779 --> 10:45:31,650
fuck people do this shit how do you stream because i'm gonna give you some insight here

4482
10:45:32,370 --> 10:45:36,449
when you think about streaming and you think about how you know sitting here in a chair

4483
10:45:37,010 --> 10:45:40,849
with a camera on or with something on the screen and you're talking and you're

4484
10:45:40,849 --> 10:45:46,050
engaging right and for breaks right i maybe i'll go to take a piss like two or three times a stream

4485
10:45:46,050 --> 10:45:53,650
right it's not like oh i'll be back in like 40 minutes right like i'll see you guys in an hour

4486
10:45:53,650 --> 10:46:00,209
how do people sit here and live broadcast and entertain people for 12 straight hours like every

4487
10:46:00,209 --> 10:46:15,790
single day that's i can't even imagine doing that i know and everybody doesn't do that but i know

4488
10:46:15,790 --> 10:46:36,699
there's a lot of people that get come pretty close they do it by being boring oh yeah but if

4489
10:46:36,699 --> 10:46:41,419
even if you're the most you could be sitting there like think about when you guys sit there

4490
10:46:41,739 --> 10:46:48,989
let's just say playing a video game right even sitting down and playing a game for six seven

4491
10:46:48,989 --> 10:46:54,989
eight nine ten hours straight it takes a toll anyways you know even if you were not on a stream

4492
10:46:54,989 --> 10:47:01,819
anyway if you were sitting there just by yourself people do these 24 hour streams they do these

4493
10:47:01,819 --> 10:47:16,319
like marathons sit in the chair for 20 hours i don't know how you function it's just focusing

4494
10:47:16,319 --> 10:47:25,180
on the game and less interactivity well i mean i'm not i'm not dogging it i'm just saying it's

4495
10:47:26,139 --> 10:47:43,410
that's next level to broadcast consistently more than 10 hours of stream i can only go for

4496
10:47:43,410 --> 10:47:54,669
about eight hours straight and i forget to eat yeah interesting stuff but let's keep going
