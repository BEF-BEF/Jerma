1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,299
Oh god, oh dear god.

2
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:09,830
Alright, let me open this game. See if I can do it.

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:18,530
It's called... I think it's called Super... Psycho Baseball or something.

4
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:23,730
MVP Baseball 2005. Well, that's actually the greatest baseball game ever made, so...

5
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:31,399
You know what sucks about that? Do you guys remember?

6
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:36,170
So MVP Baseball was the best baseball game that's ever been made,

7
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:43,079
and then 2K sniped the rights to all of baseball, and they couldn't make it anymore.

8
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:49,149
A few years later, they made an NCAA version of the game, which was still amazing.

9
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:53,219
It was still really good, but they couldn't make baseball games anymore,

10
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,630
because there was a feud where, if you remember, EA made MVP Baseball.

11
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:03,460
EA also makes Madden, and they got the exclusive rights to football.

12
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,840
Nobody else could make an officially licensed football game, right, unless you were first party.

13
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,890
So, right, third... I believe third-party game developers couldn't make them.

14
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:23,459
So, I think that 2K was like, hey, fine, you want football? We'll buy the rights to baseball.

15
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:29,219
And I remember being very, very sad, because I actually did not like Madden at all.

16
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:33,400
I liked the EA baseball games, not the EA football games.

17
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:40,459
And I would have much rather they did it reverse and just bought, you know, the rights to it,

18
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:42,060
for the baseball games that are football.

19
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,390
But Madden is way more popular than MVP ever was.

20
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,069
What was it? What game were we playing? Oh, yeah, right.

21
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:55,709
All right, this is called... Yeah, Super Psycho Baseball.

22
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:58,310
This has been recommended a few times in the recommended Discord.

23
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:03,769
By the way, if you don't know, the Discord has a recommended channel.

24
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:13,009
I look at it all the time, and here's proof.

25
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:22,800
I think I need to capture it a different way. Let's see.

26
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:32,759
Uh-huh, there we go.

27
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:38,969
All right, so I don't know, this... Let's give it a try.

28
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:48,210
Can one of the mods change the title?

29
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:53,780
Hey there, nice to see you again. You lost the game? Figured.

30
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,090
I haven't even played.

31
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,240
Play ball!

32
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,860
What? How do I hit? Why am I so small?

33
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,069
How do I hit the baseball?

34
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:26,020
Oh, I have HP? That's got to be out.

35
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:36,620
God damn it. How do you hit a home run?

36
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,639
I'm going to lose. I don't even know how to play.

37
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,000
You got to get just under it.

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,210
Let's go on. Go on!

39
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:50,969
Good. All right. I get it. I get it. I understand. I understand.

40
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:55,990
Let's go. Go on.

41
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:04,300
Go on.

42
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:13,500
Go on.

43
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,350
That's how you come back and you win.

44
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,250
Five in a row.

45
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,040
At the very last out.

46
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,540
Unbelievable.

47
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,180
That's one inning down. Two to go.

48
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,079
All right, first inning.

49
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,029
Do I still have only 10 HP? Whoa, hold on.

50
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:39,500
112 coins.

51
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,100
Heal 20 HP.

52
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,000
Devil's Pack.

53
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,899
Sell your soul.

54
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:48,050
Regain 5% of your max HP with every home run.

55
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,750
Nerd glasses.

56
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,149
You put on a pair of specs.

57
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:54,589
Increases range of a perfect hit.

58
00:04:54,589 --> 00:04:55,790
You have an even bigger heart.

59
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:00,370
You might want to see a doctor, but HP is max HP by 30.

60
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:05,680
I mean, I think it's the nerd glasses, right?

61
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,040
How much do I have? I need to heal.

62
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,949
You only get to pick one.

63
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:13,750
He's throwing a lot faster now, but I think that's still gone.

64
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,259
That makes six in a row.

65
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:17,959
He's throwing so fast.

66
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:22,670
I picked the shittiest upgrade.

67
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:30,129
He's on fire. That's seven in a row.

68
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:36,740
That's gone. Get out!

69
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:42,550
Sorry.

70
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,149
He's throwing, so I...

71
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:44,649
Whatever.

72
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:47,050
It's okay. Sometimes you lose in level one.

73
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:52,949
If you're bad.

74
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:56,019
You get that first time somebody plays.

75
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:58,120
You're supposed to say, hey, try again.

76
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,319
That was the tutorial.

77
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,120
Now you know how to play.

78
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,519
So now don't click one power up.

79
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:08,879
All right, let's go.

80
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:11,879
Okay, I understand how it works.

81
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:12,980
I'm going for it now.

82
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,819
Sorry if I hit you.

83
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:22,769
I've had a bad day.

84
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:25,740
Play ball!

85
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,139
Started off good.

86
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:35,339
Goodbye baseball.

87
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:41,769
Goodbye baseball.

88
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,769
You got to get just under it.

89
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:51,300
Three in a row.

90
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,699
That's good enough, right?

91
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:54,139
Four in a row.

92
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:54,740
All right.

93
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,839
Good start.

94
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,860
Shit.

95
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:07,000
It's okay.

96
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,899
That's a moon shot.

97
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:08,800
All right, now let me...

98
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,300
I got...

99
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,100
Honey hell, let me not waste this.

100
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,399
That's one inning down.

101
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:17,899
Two to go.

102
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:19,339
Okay.

103
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:20,439
Your bat grows in size.

104
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,240
Hitbox size.

105
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,709
I kind of want that.

106
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:24,509
More HP.

107
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:25,209
You know what it is.

108
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:26,209
Power boosted.

109
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:28,779
Oh, I think I might go for the power.

110
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:33,759
Should I take the steroids?

111
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,699
All right.

112
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:35,399
Go ahead.

113
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:42,250
Call me a one-pitch Andy.

114
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,449
No, this is going to work.

115
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:45,910
This is going to work pretty well.

116
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,720
One-pitch Andy.

117
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,779
Don't get over it.

118
00:07:54,779 --> 00:08:02,660
Goodbye baseball.

119
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,949
Home.

120
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:08,829
All right.

121
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:10,370
Jesus.

122
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:10,769
I had...

123
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:12,730
That's enough, I think.

124
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:20,639
Three in a row.

125
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:20,839
There we go.

126
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:21,139
All right.

127
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:21,540
What am I buying next?

128
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:26,199
Four in a row.

129
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,800
Another inning in the book.

130
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,919
One more to go.

131
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,320
Hundred and...

132
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:33,720
All right.

133
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,110
Steroids two.

134
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:36,509
I don't have enough.

135
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:41,340
Should I hold it?

136
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:48,370
I think I buy this and hold this one.

137
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,320
Because I'll get this next.

138
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,889
Psycho mode activated.

139
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:54,690
What does that mean?

140
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,090
One last shot.

141
00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:03,330
I'm going to throw really hard this time.

142
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,230
No fucking way.

143
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:12,840
It's literally impossible.

144
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,139
Come on.

145
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:15,370
Get out.

146
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:23,970
Home.

147
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:30,450
Home.

148
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:30,850
Come on.

149
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:31,820
Up.

150
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:49,389
That's a loop.

151
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:53,100
Goodbye baseball.

152
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,200
We had a raid?

153
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,730
Hold on, hold on.

154
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,830
Oh my goodness.

155
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,529
No.

156
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:01,429
No, no, no, no.

157
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:04,149
Not in the last pitch.

158
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:04,850
Thank God.

159
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,129
I fucking actually nailed it.

160
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:10,950
It's out of here.

161
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,649
Oh no, I lost and I have to go home to my super hot girlfriend.

162
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:15,649
You...

163
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:16,049
You completed...

164
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:16,750
You advanced.

165
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,279
I advanced?

166
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:24,230
We had like three raids come in.

167
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,590
Bruce Green,

168
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,590
Sideshow,

169
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,159
and Bren.

170
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,080
What's up?

171
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,350
Thanks a lot, guys.

172
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:38,509
Thanks, everybody.

173
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:39,210
Welcome to the channel.

174
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,309
We're playing this baseball game.

175
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:44,059
It's pretty cool.

176
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:45,259
It's called Super Psycho Baseball.

177
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:48,149
Hope you had good streams.

178
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:51,730
I'm ready to rock and roll.

179
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:52,429
Raid songs?

180
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:56,820
We don't do raid songs.

181
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,019
All right.

182
00:10:57,019 --> 00:10:59,600
I'm definitely doing steroids, though.

183
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,159
Hope you guys are fans of baseball.

184
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:09,950
Or should I be conservative here?

185
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:17,629
I feel like this is a big deal.

186
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:22,409
Uh...

187
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:30,470
So many of my brothers chopped berries.

188
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,169
Play ball!

189
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:34,460
I only have 10 HP.

190
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:40,909
Adios, baseball.

191
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,710
That was fucked up.

192
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,409
Now you, too, have experienced loss.

193
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:50,529
They made Super Psycho.

194
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:51,230
Do I start at the beginning,

195
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,730
or do I start at the tree?

196
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,240
Shit.

197
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,340
Let's hurry this up.

198
00:11:55,340 --> 00:12:02,259
I've got a pit.

199
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:06,470
Play ball!

200
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,169
Oh, come on.

201
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:12,690
That was perfect.

202
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:20,590
It's out of here.

203
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,889
That's a moonshot.

204
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:24,490
So I need to do accuracy.

205
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,659
I think it's more important.

206
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:37,879
Three in a row.

207
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:39,899
Four in a row.

208
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:51,259
Rogue-like baseball.

209
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:51,960
I...

210
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,779
How did I swing through that?

211
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:57,080
Um, I lost it.

212
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,399
I'm playing really poorly now.

213
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:06,899
Oh, come on.

214
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:18,580
Come on! Restart.

215
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,080
Hey.

216
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,179
My name's Pitchy.

217
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:25,340
And I got a hell of a fastball.

218
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,240
Keep your eye on the ball.

219
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,840
I'm trying.

220
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:37,879
Play ball!

221
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:43,850
Goodbye, baseball.

222
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,549
You got all of that one.

223
00:13:45,549 --> 00:13:46,250
Perfect.

224
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,129
Shit.

225
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:49,429
That's a moonshot.

226
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:56,649
I don't have more than 20 coins?

227
00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:05,679
Three in a row.

228
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:13,539
Four in a row.

229
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:15,299
Okay. Next inning.

230
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:16,000
Count it.

231
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,299
Five in a row.

232
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:19,500
How did I get more coins for less distance?

233
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,460
That's one inning down.

234
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,360
Two to go.

235
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,340
All right.

236
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,340
Can you talk a little louder?

237
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,039
Vinnie's stream is a little loud right now.

238
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:33,250
What...

239
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,620
What are you doing?

240
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:42,789
What are you doing?

241
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:43,990
Five percent does not sound like...

242
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:55,419
It's not very much.

243
00:14:55,419 --> 00:14:58,309
These two are effectively the same power-up.

244
00:14:58,309 --> 00:15:05,480
Technically, right?

245
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,379
I'll go ahead and tip you my next pitch.

246
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:12,179
It's a fastball.

247
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:15,669
That makes six in a row.

248
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:19,669
I need health.

249
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,570
That was a really hard pitch to hit and I got it.

250
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:29,559
I didn't get under it enough.

251
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:37,909
Goodbye, baseball.

252
00:15:37,909 --> 00:15:44,299
It's out of here.

253
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:47,350
That's enough.

254
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:59,500
Three in a row.

255
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,000
All right.

256
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,940
I've got 70 percent.

257
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,440
Another inning in the book.

258
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,820
One more to go.

259
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,519
Breath of the Wild.

260
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,299
I don't have my switch set up over here.

261
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:19,899
It's definitely this one.

262
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:22,009
I need the health.

263
00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:25,929
Five percent HP every time you hit a home run.

264
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:28,360
Psycho mode.

265
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,960
It's the final inning and I'm all oiled up.

266
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:39,970
Let's go.

267
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,929
Is that enough?

268
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:49,159
It's out of here.

269
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:49,960
That's got to be enough.

270
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,669
Yep.

271
00:16:51,669 --> 00:16:58,220
Home run.

272
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:06,180
What a... That pitch was so...

273
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,579
Adios, baseball.

274
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:12,660
This game is hard.

275
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:20,130
That wasn't even in the strike zone.

276
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:30,789
It's out of here.

277
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:31,089
There you go.

278
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:32,380
All right.

279
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:32,980
Next inning.

280
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,279
Next.

281
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:36,960
Adios, baseball.

282
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,559
You're just bad.

283
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,900
It's not my fault I was only programmed to throw a fastball.

284
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,500
Move the camera to the top right.

285
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,819
Uh, hold on.

286
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:47,519
It's this.

287
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:56,859
Right?

288
00:17:56,859 --> 00:18:02,289
Big bat.

289
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:06,660
That's 10 health every time I hit a home run.

290
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:10,130
But this means I'll hit more home runs.

291
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,329
I'm going for this.

292
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:12,529
All right.

293
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:14,660
Come on.

294
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:19,589
This tree throws curveballs.

295
00:18:19,589 --> 00:18:19,789
All right.

296
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:21,930
Just zone in.

297
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:25,819
Walk in and go for it.

298
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:32,630
That's so fucked up.

299
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:35,269
Goodbye, baseball.

300
00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:40,349
Give me the health.

301
00:18:40,349 --> 00:18:51,779
Hit the pole.

302
00:18:51,779 --> 00:19:01,069
Goodbye, baseball.

303
00:19:01,069 --> 00:19:01,869
Thank God for the heal.

304
00:19:01,869 --> 00:19:09,009
Goodbye, baseball.

305
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:09,509
All right.

306
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:11,079
Now we're working.

307
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:29,289
Three in a row.

308
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:32,420
Okay, inning two.

309
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:42,400
How did that not go out?

310
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,000
All right.

311
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,019
Good.

312
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:47,380
It's out of here.

313
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,980
I have to hit two or three home runs right in a row.

314
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,180
That's one inning down.

315
00:19:50,180 --> 00:20:02,960
Two to go.

316
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:12,930
Both of these or...

317
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:17,250
I can do both, right?

318
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,799
No, I can't.

319
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:26,890
It's either both of these or the health boost.

320
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,089
You don't need the glasses.

321
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:38,640
Yeah, I do need this though.

322
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,720
I could do this and heal, I think, right?

323
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,819
That will heal you.

324
00:20:42,819 --> 00:20:44,450
That's true.

325
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,309
Yep.

326
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:49,009
What do you mean, you smoke?

327
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:55,180
Hit the pole.

328
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,779
Fuck off.

329
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:07,809
It's over.

330
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:08,880
Okay.

331
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,380
I think I still have a one.

332
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,039
I can do two outs.

333
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:14,940
That was really hard to hit.

334
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,940
I think I got it.

335
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,640
All right.

336
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:23,720
We're good.

337
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,920
Three in a row.

338
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,650
Pull it all the way back.

339
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,549
Back to 100 health.

340
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:41,579
Four in a row.

341
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:49,220
Get over.

342
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,359
Shit.

343
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:55,170
Sorry.

344
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,759
Get up.

345
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:57,660
Come on.

346
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,759
Don't do it like this.

347
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:11,150
Audio.

348
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:11,650
All right.

349
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:12,650
This is very important.

350
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,150
Another inning in the book.

351
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:28,220
One more to go.

352
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,000
I can do both.

353
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,329
I could heal, but no.

354
00:22:33,329 --> 00:22:34,630
I got to do both of these.

355
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:41,049
I have to do bat and steroids.

356
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:47,440
I don't think I can heal roids and steroids.

357
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:47,940
Okay.

358
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,240
Yep.

359
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,480
Let's go.

360
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,900
Psycho mode.

361
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,900
One more inning.

362
00:22:52,900 --> 00:23:01,039
I'll turn you to logs.

363
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,539
God damn it, dude.

364
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:03,339
No way.

365
00:23:03,339 --> 00:23:06,539
You made my cousin into a rock and you sold him at Cracker Bear.

366
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:08,890
Super.

367
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:11,420
No way.

368
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,720
That's so hard.

369
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,490
It's ridiculous.

370
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:16,690
All right.

371
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:17,690
One more try and that's it.

372
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:18,589
And I'll move out too.

373
00:23:18,589 --> 00:23:23,470
I'll play something else.

374
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,369
Sorry if I hit you.

375
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:30,740
One more try.

376
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:36,000
That thing comes in so fast.

377
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,539
It's out of here.

378
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:48,390
What a failure already.

379
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,299
What's the stream title?

380
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:52,730
Adios, baseball.

381
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,730
Baseball stream 2.0.

382
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:56,529
Wallet is a bit tight.

383
00:23:56,529 --> 00:23:58,230
Wait, what are you talking about?

384
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,880
Wallet is a bit tight.

385
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:14,970
Featuring fishies with that face.

386
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:21,869
That's a loon.

387
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:23,099
Get up.

388
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:29,529
Goodbye baseball.

389
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:35,279
That should have hit.

390
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,240
That's a loon shot.

391
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,240
All right.

392
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,740
If the heel pops up, it's happening immediately.

393
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,640
That's one inning down.

394
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,339
Two to go.

395
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:47,769
That heel is necessary for any run.

396
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:48,470
It's not here.

397
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:51,309
So I'll take this one then.

398
00:24:51,309 --> 00:25:03,880
Hope you don't mind if I throw a little harder, kid.

399
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:11,380
Adios, baseball.

400
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,400
Stay fair.

401
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:21,559
Home run.

402
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:31,680
Three in a row.

403
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,480
Four in a row.

404
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,819
Need the heel.

405
00:25:34,819 --> 00:25:41,740
Charge the mound.

406
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,440
Count it.

407
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,569
Five in a row.

408
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:45,970
This guy just throws fast.

409
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:46,769
The other one has curveballs.

410
00:25:46,769 --> 00:25:48,170
Another inning in the book.

411
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:53,450
One more to go.

412
00:25:53,450 --> 00:26:00,450
There it is.

413
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,049
All right.

414
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:02,049
Now we're in business.

415
00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:04,460
Psycho mode activated.

416
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,859
One last shot.

417
00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:11,920
I'm going to throw really hard this time.

418
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,200
That makes six in a row.

419
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:24,869
Need to get this health back.

420
00:26:24,869 --> 00:26:26,369
Those pitches are such bullshit.

421
00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:29,460
And they go down like that.

422
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,059
Again.

423
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:37,440
Ah, yeah, yeah.

424
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,990
I got to keep the cursors down.

425
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,490
Yeah.

426
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,789
It stayed down.

427
00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:58,240
I was thinking stay right in the middle so you can have equal place to go anywhere.

428
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,460
Still sticking with it.

429
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:00,759
Yeah.

430
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:01,559
No.

431
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:12,849
Lower thirds of the strike zone.

432
00:27:12,849 --> 00:27:13,250
All right.

433
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,349
Let's go.

434
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:17,079
Now that's a dinger.

435
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:18,380
How much health do I have?

436
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,079
Jeez.

437
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:32,859
Maybe my x-line was right about me.

438
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,559
Reduce the speed and bat size.

439
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:44,819
How many trees died to make-

440
00:27:44,819 --> 00:27:45,119
All right.

441
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:45,920
I got to focus.

442
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,500
50 health.

443
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,599
Play ball.

444
00:27:55,660 --> 00:28:03,740
Come on, man.

445
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:11,980
Home.

446
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:18,940
Home.

447
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:22,480
That's got enough.

448
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:32,470
Three in a row.

449
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:40,180
Four in a row.

450
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:43,619
That was a weird pitch, but I still got it.

451
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:46,579
Nice.

452
00:28:46,579 --> 00:28:48,980
Does the game account for where you click on the ball?

453
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,200
Does it change the angle it does?

454
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:58,539
So you have to get slightly under the ball.

455
00:28:58,539 --> 00:28:59,240
All right.

456
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,440
Slower pitches, I think, is the way to go.

457
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,589
Because that's 12%.

458
00:29:06,589 --> 00:29:08,480
Although it might mess me up.

459
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,460
Yeah, I'll do it.

460
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:27,210
This time, we'll make it.

461
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:36,529
Home.

462
00:29:36,529 --> 00:29:45,289
Home.

463
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:54,069
Three in a row.

464
00:29:54,069 --> 00:30:00,549
Over it.

465
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:06,819
Goodbye baseball.

466
00:30:06,819 --> 00:30:07,220
Nice.

467
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,180
All right.

468
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:09,680
Home.

469
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,779
I've got a good amount of health.

470
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:13,180
I've just got to be very, very early to swing.

471
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,680
Another inning in the book.

472
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,720
One more to go.

473
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,519
Are you mad?

474
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:18,119
Oh, I'm not.

475
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:24,200
I'm just focusing.

476
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,509
Gravity.

477
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:31,549
5% of 30 is more.

478
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:44,779
Or should I do, I don't know.

479
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:50,779
This is important, too, though.

480
00:30:50,779 --> 00:30:54,240
Gum or gravity?

481
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,700
I'll go gum.

482
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,039
Because if I just have to hit, I just need to-

483
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:01,210
I'll heal.

484
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,009
All right.

485
00:31:03,009 --> 00:31:08,960
This is very fast.

486
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,660
Good start.

487
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:27,130
What?

488
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:34,309
That's a loonshot.

489
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,990
Oh, ball behind me.

490
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:47,299
Way under it.

491
00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:53,380
It's out of here.

492
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:59,359
Grr.

493
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:00,160
Fuck you.

494
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,960
Oh, man.

495
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,400
That's it.

496
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:04,900
I thought that-

497
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,880
Whatever.

498
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,380
It's so hard.

499
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,789
Now you two.

500
00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:12,500
They made my uncle into a super psycho.

501
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,400
That was fun.

502
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,099
That was a good-

503
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,099
This is hard.

504
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:17,000
Is this supposed to be a chill stream?

505
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,700
It is.

506
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:28,430
But I can't say F you.

507
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,390
It's so fast.

508
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,910
One more?

509
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,420
One more.

510
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:39,440
I have to beat the tree.

511
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,140
Hey there.

512
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,440
Nice to see you again.

513
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,640
You lost the game?

514
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,640
What's your refresh rate?

515
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,390
144?

516
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:52,250
Play ball!

517
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:58,519
All right, the real stupid thing here is to lose any health against this first two innings.

518
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:00,019
You know, right?

519
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,220
This first inning, you should not lose a single health.

520
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:11,819
It's out of here.

521
00:33:11,819 --> 00:33:15,569
Three in a row.

522
00:33:15,569 --> 00:33:16,769
My mom just heard you swearing.

523
00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:21,710
She said, my germa privileges are revoked.

524
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:25,930
Four in a row.

525
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:30,890
Well, I'll tell you something you can do.

526
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:35,069
You got to put something on the table.

527
00:33:35,069 --> 00:33:39,660
You got to put some type of bargaining chip on the table.

528
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,059
Oh, like, yeah.

529
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:44,759
I mean, I'll clean my room.

530
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:49,200
I'll help with some chores around the house.

531
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,680
You got to put some bargaining chips up.

532
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:58,450
I'll help you move furniture, right?

533
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:04,400
Be like, I'm sorry that the guy that I watch sucks.

534
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:04,900
There it is.

535
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:12,840
No, that's not what I want.

536
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:20,949
Isn't this just better?

537
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:24,760
This is just better.

538
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,360
Go ahead.

539
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:31,280
Call me a one-pitch Andy.

540
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,840
That makes six in a row.

541
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,340
Guess what?

542
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:39,039
Next time your mother comes in with groceries,

543
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:40,340
get off your ass and go help.

544
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,340
He's on fire.

545
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:45,119
That's seven in a row.

546
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,869
And then, I don't know, maybe it's like, oh, OK.

547
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:53,940
Maybe you can get some theater privileges back or whatever.

548
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:57,400
Dad?

549
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,300
Hey, next time your mother shows up with groceries,

550
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:08,809
get off your ass and help.

551
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:11,039
Yeehaw.

552
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:13,829
Thanks, dad.

553
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:15,329
Another inning in the book.

554
00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:17,059
One more to go.

555
00:35:17,059 --> 00:35:23,929
All right, this has been good so far.

556
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:26,170
I got a lot of money.

557
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:33,179
Steroids and bat.

558
00:35:33,179 --> 00:35:35,630
Psycho mode activated.

559
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,530
Inning three.

560
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:41,210
Time to throw even harder, I guess.

561
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:41,710
Eleven.

562
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,909
Holy poggers, there's eleven in a row.

563
00:35:43,909 --> 00:35:46,300
Did he just say holy pog?

564
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,260
I'm getting more money with the multiplier.

565
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:53,590
I'm getting a lot more money with the multiplier.

566
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:59,429
This guy's quick.

567
00:35:59,429 --> 00:36:06,059
Oh, that was out of the strike zone, whatever.

568
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:13,780
Adios, baseball.

569
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,079
You have to get them in a row.

570
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:17,079
That's how you get the money to buy everything.

571
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:22,579
Adios, baseball.

572
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:24,679
Pray for our heel in between innings here,

573
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:29,510
because I need it.

574
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:33,360
Goodbye, baseball.

575
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,059
It's not about winning or losing.

576
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:39,920
It's about something else.

577
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,059
Nice.

578
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:42,960
All right, there's the first heel.

579
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,059
Five percent every time I hit a home run.

580
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:46,960
And steroids.

581
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,119
I can't afford it.

582
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:53,920
Should I just hold?

583
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,010
I'm going to hold.

584
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:57,610
I don't know if I want...

585
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:00,880
I think I want accuracy.

586
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,659
I don't think I want the...

587
00:37:03,659 --> 00:37:04,059
You didn't hold?

588
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:05,360
No, I may hold the money.

589
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:14,659
I don't think I want...

590
00:37:14,659 --> 00:37:15,960
Goodbye, baseball.

591
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:21,650
I think I want accuracy.

592
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:22,349
That's got to be enough.

593
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:23,349
Come on.

594
00:37:23,349 --> 00:37:25,050
I need to heel to full health right here.

595
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,150
Adios, baseball.

596
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:31,340
Five percent of 130 is a lot.

597
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,760
Get under it.

598
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,389
Get under it.

599
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:38,789
That was like scripted talking.

600
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:41,219
Adios, baseball.

601
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:52,570
Get under it.

602
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:59,480
Adios, baseball.

603
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,280
Stay fair.

604
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,219
All right, good.

605
00:38:02,219 --> 00:38:04,780
Adios, baseball.

606
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,980
Going to be faster.

607
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,579
I got a lot of money.

608
00:38:06,579 --> 00:38:07,480
One inning down.

609
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:13,690
Two to go.

610
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,320
Oh, yeah.

611
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,929
Oh, man.

612
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:19,429
This is a big deal.

613
00:38:19,429 --> 00:38:29,309
This is huge if I could do this.

614
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:34,559
And bubblegum.

615
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:43,309
What do you mean you smoke trees?

616
00:38:43,309 --> 00:38:50,400
Jesus, those are two bad ones in a row.

617
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,699
So how much am I healing for right now?

618
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:53,400
Does everybody pay attention?

619
00:38:53,400 --> 00:39:00,139
I can't look.

620
00:39:00,139 --> 00:39:01,440
How much am I healing for?

621
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,139
A lot?

622
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:02,539
13.

623
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:06,030
That's awesome.

624
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,329
Oh, back to fucking full health.

625
00:39:07,329 --> 00:39:09,920
Let's go.

626
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,320
Just don't blow it.

627
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:24,300
Never mind.

628
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:24,900
Oh, my God.

629
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:30,070
I'm going to choke.

630
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:36,570
Oh, thank God.

631
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,699
Stay fair.

632
00:39:38,699 --> 00:39:39,599
I'm all right.

633
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:40,000
I'm all right.

634
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:47,539
I just made up all the health I just lost.

635
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:48,039
Yes.

636
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:48,440
Okay.

637
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,460
Full health.

638
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,960
Another inning in the book.

639
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,559
One more to go.

640
00:39:54,559 --> 00:40:02,199
I have to win this right now.

641
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:06,480
Oh, I don't know what to pick.

642
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,280
All of these are very important.

643
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:15,849
I it's probably steroids though.

644
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:19,900
I don't have enough for devil three.

645
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,500
Oh shit.

646
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,300
I don't have enough.

647
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:21,900
I have to do.

648
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,800
All right.

649
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,699
I don't I didn't have enough.

650
00:40:25,699 --> 00:40:28,289
I had 122.

651
00:40:28,289 --> 00:40:29,929
I'm going to hold this though.

652
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:30,829
All right.

653
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:33,429
Psycho mode activated.

654
00:40:33,429 --> 00:40:38,800
Curveball could come, but I would.

655
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,269
On good start.

656
00:40:41,269 --> 00:41:00,409
Four in a row.

657
00:41:00,409 --> 00:41:05,039
Jesus Christ.

658
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:17,920
It's so hard.

659
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,110
Get out.

660
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:27,110
It's out of here.

661
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:36,599
Shit.

662
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:38,960
Get out.

663
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,860
My hands are sweating.

664
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:54,130
Now that's a jinger.

665
00:41:54,130 --> 00:42:10,659
Oh, that's it.

666
00:42:10,659 --> 00:42:12,349
I got it.

667
00:42:12,349 --> 00:42:14,119
All right.

668
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:15,960
Now what?

669
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,599
I am but a tree.

670
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,639
There's another level after this.

671
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:26,130
How many levels are there?

672
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,429
I don't know what to do.

673
00:42:27,429 --> 00:42:36,230
Should I boost the HP even more or do power?

674
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:39,730
Power I think is what I need.

675
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:45,159
I'm going to hold this because I got to buy.

676
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:50,360
I have to buy this next time.

677
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:50,960
Wake up.

678
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,159
There are baseball tryouts to go to.

679
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:57,909
Harry, he's a little crazy.

680
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,710
Look at the size of this wall.

681
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:00,610
What?

682
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:01,309
What just happened?

683
00:43:01,309 --> 00:43:06,260
The ball didn't even come out of his hand.

684
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:10,820
Excuse me.

685
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:29,769
Where's the ball?

686
00:43:29,769 --> 00:43:30,469
Dude.

687
00:43:30,469 --> 00:43:38,000
By the way, any ladies watching?

688
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,050
I am single.

689
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:45,349
Well, we got to the end of that one.

690
00:43:45,349 --> 00:43:48,510
That was fun.

691
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:49,909
You can't call that a skill issue.

692
00:43:49,909 --> 00:43:53,409
That was.

693
00:43:53,409 --> 00:43:55,409
Good luck if you want a super psycho baseball.

694
00:43:55,409 --> 00:44:00,219
Good luck if you want to play it at level three.

695
00:44:00,219 --> 00:44:05,849
It's very difficult and good luck.

696
00:44:05,849 --> 00:44:07,949
Do I have anything else I can start?

697
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:10,530
Let me see.

698
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:12,800
That's fun.

699
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,150
What else do I have here?

700
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:20,250
I don't know if there's anything I could really do for that much longer.

701
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:23,960
Let's see.

702
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,260
If you're wondering what's happening tomorrow,

703
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:30,960
Ster and I are going to play this game called Ember.

704
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,159
Firefighter game.

705
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:35,960
Like a wacky firefighter game, I think.

706
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,059
I don't know what time we're going to start.

707
00:44:37,059 --> 00:44:46,030
I'll talk to him tonight and see.

708
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:49,820
That game is amazing.

709
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:53,230
Yeah, I think I'll probably just call it here.

710
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:59,929
I think it's a good time.

711
00:44:59,929 --> 00:45:01,530
I have a lot of games to play,

712
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:08,130
but a lot of them are not like 45-minute experiences.

713
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:16,119
Go back and finish the other game.

714
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:20,860
When are you going to watch Biodome?

715
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:28,010
I don't think I'm going to watch Biodome, man.

716
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:29,510
Yeah, that's...

717
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:30,909
I'll call it here.

718
00:45:30,909 --> 00:45:32,889
I'll see you tomorrow.

719
00:45:32,889 --> 00:45:38,889
And then the plan going forward from here is

720
00:45:38,889 --> 00:45:46,269
Driver 1 is going to be a part of a bigger PlayStation 1 Xbox 360 night.

721
00:45:46,269 --> 00:45:50,889
There's still probably five games down there on the Reddit shelf

722
00:45:50,989 --> 00:45:53,380
that I never played.

723
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,380
They're kind of just sitting down there.

724
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:57,460
There's like at least five or six games that I never played down there.

725
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:01,940
So definitely going to play them.

726
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:03,340
What about the Ace Attorney games?

727
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:08,980
I did hear that there's a new Ace Attorney game that released

728
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:11,860
and there's no white flashing.

729
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:14,980
So, I mean, I could probably play that now.

730
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:19,809
Or you can disable white flashing.

731
00:46:19,809 --> 00:46:21,510
PS1 and 360 are 10 years apart.

732
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:23,320
Well, I'm going to have a range.

733
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,820
I'm going to play Driver 1, a few more PlayStation 1 games,

734
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:27,780
a few PlayStation 2 games.

735
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:32,059
The rest is some of these stragglers of Xbox and Xbox 360 games

736
00:46:32,059 --> 00:46:35,449
that we never played from like, I'm talking five years ago.

737
00:46:35,449 --> 00:46:36,949
Four or five years ago.

738
00:46:36,949 --> 00:46:39,659
They're here.

739
00:46:39,659 --> 00:46:41,059
The new trilogy has an option for that.

740
00:46:41,059 --> 00:46:44,329
Okay.

741
00:46:44,329 --> 00:46:49,630
Yeah, that's the plan.

742
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:51,030
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

743
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:54,329
I don't have a time, but I'll make sure the sauce is updated.

744
00:46:54,329 --> 00:46:57,219
And I'll see you tomorrow.

745
00:46:57,219 --> 00:46:57,719
Thanks for watching.

746
00:46:57,719 --> 00:46:58,949
Take care.

747
00:46:58,949 --> 00:46:59,650
See you soon.

748
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,349
It's a chill stream.

749
00:47:00,349 --> 00:47:02,170
We just kind of hang out.

750
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:05,449
I do want to do a lot more of these.

751
00:47:05,449 --> 00:47:11,969
I am very much in the market for doing more just kind of play games

752
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:14,079
and hang out streams.

753
00:47:14,179 --> 00:47:20,239
2023 is going to be the year of just streaming games and hanging out.

754
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:28,250
We're going to be kind of going back to the basics here.

755
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:34,869
What about Sorcery?

756
00:47:34,869 --> 00:47:37,099
Yeah.

757
00:47:37,099 --> 00:47:45,519
I'll fit everything in.

758
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:50,440
I definitely do want to incorporate way more streams like this,

759
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,139
but we can just kind of fuck around and play something.

760
00:47:53,139 --> 00:47:55,639
It doesn't have to be anything, you know, in particular like,

761
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:56,239
oh, it's got to be this.

762
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:56,940
It's got to be that.

763
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:57,440
It's just like, you know what?

764
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,889
I'm going to open up Super Psycho Baseball and play for an hour.

765
00:48:00,889 --> 00:48:02,590
I'm going to play this game for like four hours.

766
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:03,530
Whatever.

767
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:08,059
That's what I'm going to do.

768
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:14,840
Which also, I'll be honest, that means that each stream is...

769
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:19,300
I will not be against now, not like I was against it before,

770
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:24,659
but actually starting games and playing through them and finishing them.

771
00:48:24,659 --> 00:48:27,360
I know I abandoned one literally an hour ago.

772
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:32,349
But, you know, there are games that have been on this list of,

773
00:48:32,349 --> 00:48:34,780
I mean, like Paper Mario, for instance.

774
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:39,679
It's just like, do I really want to play Paper Mario for like the 20, 30, 40 hours that it...

775
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,739
Yeah, probably.

776
00:48:41,739 --> 00:48:42,440
Breath of the Wild.

777
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:42,840
Oh, yeah.

778
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:43,440
No, I'll go.

779
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:43,940
Don't worry.

780
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:49,010
I'll go back to it.

781
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:58,219
There's a lot of stuff to do.

782
00:48:58,219 --> 00:48:59,960
Finish Yakuza.

783
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:04,059
Honestly, Finish Yakuza has got to a point where it would be restart Yakuza,

784
00:49:04,059 --> 00:49:13,190
because I have not played it in two to three straight years.

785
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:14,289
Is Battle Axe still happening?

786
00:49:14,289 --> 00:49:17,539
Oh, yes.

787
00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:18,639
It very much is.

788
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:28,570
Alright, I didn't have the music playing.

789
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:29,070
Thanks for watching.

790
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:30,889
Thanks for hanging out.

791
00:49:30,889 --> 00:49:33,039
Have a good rest of your night, guys.

792
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:36,010
See you tomorrow.

793
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:40,659
The game is going to be Ember.

794
00:49:40,659 --> 00:49:41,559
Take care.

795
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:43,539
Call your mother.

796
00:49:43,539 --> 00:49:44,039
You know.
