00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,939
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some live gun game.

2
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,420
This is actually on the newer map for gun games. Arms race, whatever you want to call it.

3
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,100
Come here you.

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:29,269
Come here. I'll get this guy. Bang! Get slotted. Come on, come on, come on.

5
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:34,960
What's up, dude? What's up, dude? Keep it going, keep it going, keep it going here.

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,049
Whoa, whoa!

7
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:44,329
What? How did I not kill that guy? Oh, that was a bunch of BS.

8
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:55,090
That was a bunch of HE double hockey sticks. Isaac Clarke has killed me. He spent time away from... Whoa, behind us.

9
00:00:56,859 --> 00:01:03,479
Oh, that was lucky. Come on, come on, come on. I don't know anything about this map. Where, what, it's like a snow map?

10
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:12,379
What the hell is this place? Oh, damn it. I'm not that far behind. I can catch up. Like that. Come on.

11
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:18,829
Where you at? Oh, looks like they spawn over here, maybe? I don't even know.

12
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:32,450
Ooh, there it is. No, no, no. Oh, damn it. Come here. Oh,

13
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,519
God, I'm so bad. Oh, so bad. Oh,

14
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:45,719
Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? I gotta keep this going here. I could win this if I keep it up.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's a teammate. Sorry.

16
00:01:50,879 --> 00:02:02,840
Let's go back up here. No, come here you. Come here. Got an achievement too.

17
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,700
Hell-freaking-yeah. Top. Yeah, he's a guy.

18
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:20,180
I'm falling behind here. What? How is it even possible? I should have hit that guy right in his teeth. There we are.

19
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,349
Come on. I gotta string some together here. Get two, two, three in a row. Two, three, two, come on, come on, come on.

20
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:35,500
There's a guy right out here. Drop down. Nope. See up here. I'm so scared. I'm still in this. D'oh!

21
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:48,360
That guy got turned on big time right there. Oh, they spawn. Spawn. Where is he? I have no idea where that guy is. Oh,

22
00:02:49,930 --> 00:03:00,860
shit. What? How the hell did you get up there, dude? Come on. Show yourself. Show yourself. Did he kill him? Oh my god.

23
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:17,009
I'm losing it now. All right. Try hard mode. Here we go. Oh, this guy's got 15.

24
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:32,080
I'm gonna scream. There it is. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Of course. Of course I run into the guy that said

25
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:49,139
invincibility. I'll give you invincibility. Gotta get that headshot. What's more have I got right now? 12 and 10. Yes.

26
00:03:49,340 --> 00:04:02,569
That's a teammate. Don't want to shoot the teammate in the back. Oh, damn it. I'm going up top. I'm going up top here.

27
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:07,979
I will get a good vantage point up here. This guy right here is so dead. Wait, what? That's a shadow.

28
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:18,040
That's the guy's shadow I was gonna shoot at. If that guy turned around and killed me, I would have been so upset about that.

29
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:34,050
16, 21. Damn it. There we go. There it is. Come on. How many times have I said there it is?

30
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:49,500
Probably like 80. Is he right here? Where is he? Where? Oh, where? Top. This guy's gonna be on knife in a second here.

31
00:04:51,610 --> 00:05:00,540
They're up on the roofs. The roofs. Such a bad gun to be doing that with. That was such a bad idea.

32
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:12,170
I gotta go up and under. Where? Where? On the roofs?

33
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:17,939
Everybody's on a roof.

34
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:37,139
We've got to catch up to this guy. Pick that guy off. This guy's gonna be on knife. It's alright. It's alright.

35
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,220
As long as that guy does not get a knife kill right now. That's the guy right there. There he is.

36
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:45,500
Don't get knifed. Don't get knifed, man. Don't get knifed.

37
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:49,279
Where? I keep...

38
00:05:51,540 --> 00:06:14,079
He's through the door. Oh, we're gonna lose this I think. He's gonna get it right here. No.

39
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:26,110
Just don't get knifed. Yeah, that was him right there. That was the guy. Oh, I'm so lucky. Gotta get some more picks.

40
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:32,129
Oh, that was so...

41
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:39,889
That poor guy. I can still make this happen.

42
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:53,939
If that guy wasn't with me, I would not have killed him. Thank you, dude. Oh

43
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:05,750
No, he got it. That guy was 27 and 7. Oh my god.

44
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:11,899
Well, that's gonna wrap up the video guys. Thank you so much for watching. Really do appreciate it. Go check out this new map.

45
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:17,379
I believe there is another map as well, but it's not arms race. So go check out this new content dudes.

46
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:22,699
It's free, free download, and I'll see you guys all soon. And of course, take care everybody.
