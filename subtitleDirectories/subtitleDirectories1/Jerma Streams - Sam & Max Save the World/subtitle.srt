1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:14,410
Hello there. How you doing? Doing good. Me too. I'm doing good too. Hey, still in school?

2
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:33,979
Good. Still at that job? Good. Still hanging out with uh, good. Cool. Still, still eating salmon?

3
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:50,649
Good. Good. No, no. 3am stream. There's a late one, but there's a reason for that. I told you guys I

4
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:59,219
was gonna go four days in a row because I got a lot of stuff planned. I'm taking a vacation

5
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:05,689
and I'm not talking about, oh I'll be gone for three days. I'm taking a real, I ain't gonna be

6
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:13,510
around for like a week. I'm gonna be done disconnecting from the internet for a little while.

7
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:26,280
My mother is coming up and I'm gonna spend time with my mom. It's been a long time since I've seen

8
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,590
her. We have a lot of activities planned. We're gonna just do, we're gonna do some mother-son things

9
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,680
and there's also some other family that are coming up as well. So I'm gonna be tied up for a while.

10
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:51,959
I will return. You'll see me again. Probably on, we'll probably go, depending what we do today.

11
00:01:51,959 --> 00:02:01,530
This stream was just kind of a hangout sesh, you know. Yesterday we played Gunslinger. It was great.

12
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:07,939
Had a lot of fun. Today there's not a whole lot of plans. I just knew that I was not going to be live

13
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:17,590
for at least five days. So kind of wanted just to hang out a little bit longer. So what we've decided

14
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:27,860
to do is we're gonna play Salmon Max. It's been one of the most requested games for me to stream

15
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:36,780
on this channel. There's been one guy in particular. More like two one guys. I've been really,

16
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,969
really looking forward to it. This Doki Doki. Now what I already told you I wasn't gonna play Doki

17
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:53,939
Doki. But no, this is gonna, we're just gonna hang out, play a little Salmon Max, relax. After

18
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:58,740
we do this, we might do an episode. Depending on if people want to keep seeing it. Maybe we'll do

19
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:07,319
another episode. I want to watch a couple videos. I want to, there's a few things, there's another

20
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:14,460
game on Steam that I was looking at. It looked cool. This is just a who, this, there are no cares

21
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:25,909
in the world on this stream today. I don't have a plan. We're just going. But let me make a tweet

22
00:03:25,909 --> 00:05:30,939
about it because I am live. So see you guys in a minute. Hey, so why don't we switch over to it?

23
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:39,620
It's currently right here and hopefully it captures right and did it. Oh god, I don't think it did.

24
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:46,759
Yeah it did. So I don't know very much about this game besides that it's a point and click game and we're

25
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:56,819
in a point and click mode. This is not Doki Doki Literature Club. This is Salmon Max on the road

26
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:14,120
again. A classic I've never played. You ready? Actually playing, I'm new game. This might be a

27
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,120
little loud. We can adjust the volume, but just be prepared. You might get a little bit of like a

28
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:31,800
blast. An audio blast. What? Already 10 out of 10. Anytime a saxophone presents itself in video

29
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,639
game. It's already a fucking eight or nine at least.

30
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:23,129
When are we going to get another case, Sam? Surely the local lawbreakers must miss our esoteric

31
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:28,170
brand of personalized criminal justice. Patience is a sharp razor to swallow, little buddy.

32
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:38,470
Okay, don't scream this time. I got it. I got it. Hello? What? Leave Swiss cheese by the rat hole or

33
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:43,829
you'll never see your precious phone alive again. Jiminy Christmas even a padlock sweat box.

34
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:49,509
Some misguidedly ballsy felons napped our phone. Eerie. I just went cheese shopping. How did they

35
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:57,110
know? Be sure it's Swiss cheese, right? And be quick about it. We got some rats already. Ordinarily I

36
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,750
hate yielding to extortion, but I have to admit I'm half charmed by the sheer spunk of that oily

37
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:06,629
little perp. Where'd you put the cheese, Max? Gosh, it was hours ago. You know I have the memory of a

38
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:15,290
dried trout. Sadly, yes I do. Well, it's got to be somewhere in this room. Okay, so this is the two

39
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,930
characters. This is Sam and this is Max. I only know that because not only is it telling me this,

40
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,170
I remember the thing from Team Fortress. Max's head. They're worth a lot of money.

41
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:29,290
So we're gonna get cheese. This is a point and click adventure game. You get your cardboard

42
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:36,549
box inventory. Let's turn it down a little. I already tried. You crack me up a little. You crack

43
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:45,240
me. You crack me up, little buddy. What's that? You crack me up. You crack me up, little buddy.

44
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,759
That's probably all right. You crack me up, little buddy. Voices out. You crack me up, little buddy.

45
00:08:51,960 --> 00:09:01,529
Wait, he's talking about me. Louder. Louder. Louder. Put it on low graphics. Why would I do that? I

46
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:09,559
wanted to see the cool stuff. All right, Swiss cheese. Where'd you put the cheese? What about the

47
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:15,320
wastebasket? No dice. No cheese, but about in the water cooler. Hello, Mr. Spatula. How's the

48
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:25,080
weather in there? I'm vibing so, so hard with Sam here. All right, we're looking for cheese.

49
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:35,960
Can I talk to Max? Hey, Max. When is it, Sam? Where's the cheese? You sure you don't remember

50
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,519
where you put that cheese, little buddy? Sheesh. You'd think I'd forgotten my pants or something.

51
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:45,720
It's here in the office someplace. Pants? He's looking for his pants. Let's get to work. I

52
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:52,919
couldn't agree more. Okay, look at her pants. Where are they? This might come in handy. Don't

53
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:58,360
do that again. All right, we got a boxing glove. Can I see it? I got a gun and a boxing glove,

54
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:04,230
but that's not cheese. All right, dartboard and a little of this. One of these days we're going to

55
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,629
finish that game. I'm still working on getting the rest of the darts from the police impound.

56
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:18,070
Donut box. Cheese donut. Donuts. Don't throw that out. I'm saving it for a science experiment.

57
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:27,379
You bet, little buddy. Okay, I didn't mean to do that, but you can do that, I guess. No comment.

58
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,700
You can just beat up your friend. 20 years worth of electric bills take up a surprising amount of

59
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:41,820
space. 20 years with electric bills? They would turn this off. Good old Lou. Who's Lou again?

60
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:51,559
The bowling ball, of course. Can I ask them? Maybe they know where it is.

61
00:10:51,559 --> 00:11:00,039
Yoo-hoo, tiny hoodlums. Leave the cheese by the hole. Okay, what about the desk?

62
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:06,460
VCR, television, lava lamp. Someone once told me that the contents of a lava lamp make an

63
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:14,840
excellent hand cream. That was me. Which is why I haven't tried it. This thing is regular Nintendo.

64
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:20,919
I bought that VCR at the supermarket. So you know it's a good one. Still smells like asparagus,

65
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:28,299
though. Oh, open, what a lush vegetation. I think Hubert could use some water, Max.

66
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:37,460
I'm training him to fetch it himself. Out the window. Cheese? It looks like cheese right there.

67
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:45,850
Do cheese balls look like cheese curds, right? Look at curds, cheese curds. They say graffiti

68
00:11:45,850 --> 00:12:05,610
is the poetry of our time. Just what we need. More lame poetry. Cheese. Look at the cheese. In the

69
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:13,529
closet? There's a lot of cheese. That's too much cheese. I thought that was gonna be like a piece of

70
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:45,159
cheese. Why? Oh, okay. Well, that was, that's not it. That's a gag. Okay. Swiss cheese. I want Swiss

71
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:52,230
cheese. Well, can we go to the supermarket? 2002 was a great year for calendars. This is old.

72
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,750
I'm glad we stocked up. We've been going through them at a rate of about one a year since then.

73
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:07,450
Pizza? Is it, there's no Swiss cheese on pizza, right? What do I have for item? Bowling ball,

74
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:14,539
boxing glove, big gun. Okay, he takes it out. Oh, you wait. I can, you, I can aim the gun?

75
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:23,429
Tempting sometimes, but I become fond of the little guy. Whoa. How many bullets are in here?

76
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:38,840
All right, you have infinite ammo. What about the boxing glove? I'd rather punch other things.

77
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:50,889
Just like cover the hole. Apart from the holes, I don't think it looks much like Swiss cheese.

78
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,559
Take that, you law-breaking dairy products. Got it. Sam, no, the cheese was innocent.

79
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:18,200
Yeah, it's a cartoon. I think not. Yep. You got to think of like a cartoon. Or close enough

80
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:29,340
to fool the casual observer anyway. Don't say voila. You've read chat. You've read chat. I

81
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:36,759
didn't fucking do that. Yoo-hoo. Tiny hoodlums. Leave the cheese by the hole. What the fuck is

82
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:45,580
that? I didn't fucking do that. Greetings. The members of the benevolent brotherhood of vermin

83
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:50,220
would like to thank you for your offering. The members of Sam and Max would like their phone

84
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:57,259
back now. If you don't mind, I regret to inform you the situation has changed and I am unable

85
00:14:57,259 --> 00:15:03,179
to comply with your request. A list of additional demands for the return of the button is as

86
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:12,600
followed. Now, let's discuss this calmly. Let's debone the smarmy little skis and see if the

87
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:18,919
phone's in there. I ain't talking coppers. Jimmy toothy ain't no rat. Uh, well, I ain't talking.

88
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:26,120
So wait, I can decide? How about I'll feed you broken glass? I'm thinking about stuffing a

89
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,919
light bulb down your throat, perp. Go ahead. I've been a little hungry. Hey, dog face,

90
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:38,899
your partner's giving me a headache. I'm about ready to wring your scrawny trash eating now.

91
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:45,299
No, we're going to do good cop, bad cop. Good cop, bad cop. You can't just go full bad cop.

92
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:50,980
I'm going to strangle you. I'm going to feed you glass. No, we have to like bring you a cake or

93
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:57,289
something, right? You mentioned a headache. Would you like some aspirin? Oh, and while I'm at it,

94
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,889
is there anything else I can do to make you comfortable? Are you thirsty perhaps?

95
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:05,850
Lights too bright? Well, that's sporting of you. Now you mention it. I really don't like being up

96
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:10,809
here so hot. I got me a thing about heights. They make me nervous, you know? Oh, really?

97
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:17,049
I can adjust the lights. Would you like some, a smoothie? I can make that for you too. I like

98
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:24,620
that. Almost dropped my whole coffee. Uh, how about, okay, let's, let's let them up. All right. Let's

99
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:31,179
help me help you. Help me help you, Jimmy. What the heck is that supposed to mean? I have no idea,

100
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:38,870
but it always sounds good on TV. Hand over the phone or I'll make you lick my German crusted

101
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:44,950
palms. Yeah. Yeah. I've licked the worst. Like what? You don't even want to know. Not telling.

102
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:53,860
Okay. Uh, he wants to get, how do we put them down? We'll go half easy on you. If you'll just cough

103
00:16:53,860 --> 00:17:04,119
up the phone. Yeah. Yeah. Never happened pig. We've met your demands. We got you the cheese.

104
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:07,880
Any honorable rodent would hold up his end of the bargain and give back our phone.

105
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,720
Us rodents is not known for being particularly honorable. I was going to put them down. I want

106
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:17,529
to put them down on the ground. Don't like hide, say? How'd you like it if I dangled your greasy

107
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:24,410
hide out the window? Hey, you wouldn't wait. I warned you. I'm known for my fuzzy white butter

108
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:30,089
fingers. It's true. You should see him trying to tie an ass guy. All right. All right. Have mercy.

109
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:34,569
I've had mercy. It was unpleasantly gooey. Like, well, like things that have fallen onto pavement

110
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:43,109
from a great height. I give up. Take your phone and let me go. I wish I could.

111
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:52,470
Hello. Yes. Great gouts of steaming magma on a beeline for the orphanage. We're on our way.

112
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,500
It was a commissioner, Max. Multiple reports. He killed that guy in the neighborhood.

113
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,220
You dropped that guy on the window and murdered him. Idiot. We've got to get down to the corner

114
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:20,180
store right away. Okay. Get down to the corner store. Life troubling your digestion.

115
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:26,500
Reality blocking your passages. Expel your troubles with emetics. The handbook for

116
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:33,140
multicolored happiness and separate your bliss. Hey, that's that personal color spectrum book.

117
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:43,769
Self-help for the helplessly selfish. Perfect. I'll take two. Okay. Yeah, this is cool so far.

118
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:47,210
When I got this thing, I thought it would be useful. Where else would we keep the

119
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,849
pieces of paper that we're never going to look at again? All right. Let's make sure I saved it

120
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:56,650
because we'll pick it up another day. Maybe like I'm thinking about maybe like a few weeks or

121
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:12,660
something. I'll see you guys later. That's it. 20 minutes. Can I just, if I stream for like 15

122
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:27,180
minutes a day, 20 minutes a day, 20 minutes a week, you would never get anything done.

123
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:33,369
It would be unbearable. You wouldn't be able to do anything if you stream for like

124
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:46,779
fucking 20 minutes a week. Money. Wait, wasn't there something over here? Remember I looked

125
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:59,960
out the window and there was something on the ground? I told you. Oh, it's just trash. I don't

126
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,440
think I can do anything about that. We've got to go to the corner store. I don't, I mean really

127
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:12,259
don't mean to keep hitting you like that, but what's this? Oh, you ran into it. Well, look

128
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:17,059
where you're going. Dumpster. I once ate in that dumpster. Fresh food in there. Rampaging gorilla.

129
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:20,420
I still don't know how she got out of the office. I was sure it locked the door.

130
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:29,430
That was like what the YouTube used to be like. Yeah, but the thing about the YouTube videos is

131
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:34,230
was, okay, so like for instance, if I played Sekiro for like three or four streams and I condensed it

132
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:43,579
down to like one or two videos, that's like how it worked. What's this guy doing? Say there,

133
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:49,900
unfashionably dressed street urchin. Oh, you made me mess up. Now I have to start all over.

134
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:56,299
Yeah, I had to edit. You are one ugly kid. Hey, I know you. Oh, that's right. You're one of the

135
00:20:56,299 --> 00:21:02,940
lovable scamps from that old TV show about the singing soda jerks. It's called the soda poppers.

136
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:09,900
In the 70s are not old. Specs, it's you. Wow, an actual celebrity vandalizing our neighborhood.

137
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:17,019
This is great. Remember when you were famous? Remember when you were famous? You're under arrest.

138
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:24,680
I don't look. I don't care who you are. I don't care what you're doing, where you've been.

139
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:30,359
You are committing a crime. You're under arrest. By the way, we're freelance police

140
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:34,839
and you're under arrest. No, I've really got to finish this. But thanks anyway.

141
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:43,099
That's not how it works. You're under arrest because you're doing that. That's why you're

142
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:48,859
under arrest. Seriously, you're under arrest. Come along quietly and no one gets hurt.

143
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:59,880
Actually, I prefer that you don't come quietly. Must finish painting. All right. Well, I guess

144
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,839
you're not under arrest. Boy, you sure were a famous, oddly underdeveloped teen celebrity

145
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:11,720
at one time. I'm still famous. Are you? Um, like a million point one times more famous than you.

146
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:16,599
Well, more famous than me? More known in the 18 to 34 year old repeat criminal demographic.

147
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:24,390
I like that. That was a pretty good joke. Say, how about an autograph for my pal?

148
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:30,869
You can sign my butt. Make it out to squinky. I don't sign butts anymore. People get ticklish

149
00:22:30,869 --> 00:22:36,470
and they move and it gets all messed up. I'll risk it. Sorry. I can't stop painting.

150
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:46,519
18 to 34 repeat criminal demographic is my demographic. But you guys saying you're all

151
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:55,210
repeat criminals. So specs, what are you up to these days? Any new projects? Yes. I have a new

152
00:22:55,289 --> 00:23:01,849
life in my life and his name is Brady cultures. He's the genius behind the Ibo ocular fitness

153
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:07,930
program. You really should try one of his videos. Where can I get a video? Where can I find a copy

154
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:17,829
of the video? They carry them over at Bosco's. You should get it. Okay. Ibo sounds like an electronic

155
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:26,069
archery toy. Ibo is the truly visionary. Try the video today. Sure thing. We'll try. I love that

156
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:34,069
voice. I'm gonna get, I'm gonna, I'm gonna get that down. Sounds fascinating. What about enough

157
00:23:34,069 --> 00:23:42,680
about that? You can never get enough of Brady culture's Ibo. Do I need money? All right,

158
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:49,380
we'll see. Well, that's nice. Now you're under arrest. Wait, what is it? What are you telling

159
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:56,579
me something about that trendy modern street art you're perpetrating? What about? What is it? How

160
00:23:56,579 --> 00:24:02,819
did you select your subject matter? He looks like a fried egg. It's Brady culture. He's the genius

161
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:08,660
behind the Ibo ocular fitness program. What are you, why are you trying one of his videos?

162
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:17,109
I'd rather try a fried egg. That's a good idea, Max. Sounds fascinating. That's a really good idea.

163
00:24:17,109 --> 00:24:22,309
You can never get enough. All right, see you later. Well, we'll leave you to it. But you have to agree

164
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:29,029
to paint me next. Sorry, I only paint Brady culture. Max, you've got the TV schedule memorized.

165
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:33,670
Weren't the soda poppers going to be featured on one of those grim celebrity tell-alls today?

166
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:39,670
Oh yeah, on channel 173, the child star expose network, which we only get when it's convenient.

167
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:48,329
Brady culture. Bosco's inconvenience. What about the paper box? It says they've bred a horse with

168
00:24:48,329 --> 00:24:53,130
eight legs. Does it run twice as fast? No, but it does eat twice as much.

169
00:24:55,609 --> 00:25:00,890
That's good. It says cloning rights activists are cloning themselves to create a bigger voting block.

170
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:09,160
It works for locusts. That's pretty good. Looks like he's got Boston baked beans in there. Oh watch

171
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:30,170
baby, watch it. They don't. Guns, beer, meat and candy. The four food groups. Have no fear,

172
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:35,130
simple citizens. The freelance police are here. So we're not actual police. Is that what I'm

173
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:43,930
getting? It's just YouTube. Where's the SWAT team? Where's the national guard? Where's NASA? NASA?

174
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:50,890
Hold on Bosco. What's the problem? NASA? It's a terrorist, a munchkin terrorist. He'll be the

175
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:59,480
death of us all. What munchkin terrorist? Where is this Lilliputian agitator? Are you blind? He's

176
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,119
right there. Hey it's another one of the soda poppers. Isn't he the one with the

177
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:10,680
ladder control issues? Yeah, Whizzer. He's a former child star. Oh just lock him up.

178
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:18,599
Remain calm. What's he doing? I think we got it. What's he doing? Exactly what is the nature of

179
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:25,160
Whizzer's malfeasance? He's delivering videos I didn't even order. Brady coaches Ibo. What is that?

180
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:31,240
Oh it's something bad I can tell you that. Videos. And look at that display. It's subversive and

181
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:38,599
hideous. I don't know any white guy would have throw like that. I hear that. Remain calm. Video

182
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:45,420
dumping. Any other complaints? Have you seen this Ibo video? What's on the video? Have you actually

183
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:52,140
witnessed this Ibo video with your own eyes? Only a fool would watch a strange video. You watch it.

184
00:26:53,099 --> 00:27:01,160
Anything else? Any other heinous terrorist activities to report? Yes he keeps using my bathroom.

185
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:06,920
Who knows what he's doing in there? I think I know. So we've got an unwanted video dumper and

186
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:15,400
serial leak taker. Not even the national guard can help us now. Okay so that's it. So all this

187
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:22,200
Whizzer character's doing is delivering videos and abusing his bathroom. That's it. Did he steal any

188
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,680
of your overpriced merchandise or at least try to disembowel you with a sharpened spork?

189
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:33,480
No way I've got BTAD. The single most technologically advanced security system ever conceived by the

190
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:39,960
human mind. All right what is what what is hold on what is BTADs? Why do these all look weird? Ibo.

191
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:46,519
BTAD. BTADs? Is that one of those acronym things I've been hearing so much about? Yep. Bosco Tech

192
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:52,759
automated defense system. I made it myself. Wow I always wanted to automate my defense.

193
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:58,359
How does it work? Just pull a weapon you'll see or try and walk out of here with something.

194
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:08,859
Go ahead I dare you. Maybe we will. All right is that enough of you? I think we got it. Okay

195
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:17,049
anything else? Is that enough out of you? We'll chat more later Bosco but right now it's time to

196
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:21,690
get up close and personal. We need to now find out what the fuck is going on.

197
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:29,109
Did he just steal something? What is why are you so fast?

198
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:34,759
All right hold on hold on. Free videos? Don't mind if I do.

199
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:42,519
Brady cultures Ibo for ocular fitness. The revolutionary isometric exercise. What's so

200
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:48,119
revolutionary about it? See through walls and clothing. Grow your eyes at lightning speed.

201
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:53,880
Lose five pounds of eyeball fat. Oh good I can never seem to lose that last five pounds.

202
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,720
What do you say we start off this movie night a little early today? So let's get one of these

203
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:05,059
and watch it. All right Ibo video. Do I have to buy one or do I have to can I steal it?

204
00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:10,740
Why would I steal one? I can get it from you. My coffee machine. I think it's the tinge of green

205
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:21,059
that makes this coffee especially appealing. I take my coffee green like my men. Don't need a

206
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:27,059
sludgy. With 100 all-natural sludge. This week's flavors wheatgrass and meatloaf.

207
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:34,150
Wheatgrass and meatloaf smoothies. All right I'll tell you one of those doesn't sound too bad.

208
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:40,150
I'm not going to tell you which one. It could be either one of them. Max I've got a great idea

209
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:45,990
involving you, our microwave, and six feet of aluminum foil. Go on maybe another time.

210
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,980
Am I implying that I'm going to put that rabbit in the microwave and turn it on?

211
00:29:53,369 --> 00:30:01,450
Not chose. They're mine not chose. Oh yuck yuck. That was a yuck joke. I need to hear it again.

212
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:09,609
Not chose. They're mine not chose. Not chose. They're mine not chose. Oh yuck. Ketchup, mustard,

213
00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:18,809
and purple stuff. As vaguely referred to on TV. Purple stuff. Purple ketchup. Bring it back. I

214
00:30:18,809 --> 00:30:26,410
remember it was cool. Your brain made it taste like um it tasted like blueberries. Your brain

215
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:30,890
made you taste it. It was like blueberry ketchup even though there was no blueberry in it. Your

216
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:37,130
brain just made it taste that way. Hey there Mr. Wizard. No need to be formal. My friends just call

217
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:43,690
me wizard and so do my enemies and lots of people like you I've never met. Everyone calls me wizard.

218
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:47,690
It was the chemicals. Yeah I know. I'm not saying it wasn't.

219
00:30:50,569 --> 00:30:56,329
Everybody loves your show. My cousin's wife's dentist loved your show. Oh yeah we've always

220
00:30:56,329 --> 00:31:02,410
been a big hit with the dentists. Gee I wonder why. Hey kids guzzle soda like the soda poppers

221
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:07,690
and you'll need so much expensive dental work you can kiss college goodbye. So these are soda poppers.

222
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:14,230
Cynicism is like a breath of fresh air on a crowded subway. Are you anything like your

223
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:25,509
character? So are they like the this is like Snow White and the seven soda poppers? Any chance

224
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:30,230
we could get you to sing the song from your old show? Yeah the theme song. What was it called?

225
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:38,809
It was called more than jerks but I can't sing it. I'm too embarrassed. Let's do it. Come on sing

226
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:48,069
the soda popper theme song. No. Do the voice. Do the do the character. Do it. How about an autograph

227
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:55,029
for my pal Max? You could write to Max. Thanks for saving my life that time in San Remo. Gee I don't

228
00:31:55,029 --> 00:32:01,349
really have time. I've got a lot more videos to deliver. No time? Don't they give you bathroom

229
00:32:01,349 --> 00:32:06,950
breaks? Sure but I don't sign autographs in there anymore. There was an incident.

230
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:15,079
Huh are you anything like the character you played on the tv show? Yeah like do you really have to

231
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:18,599
hit the john every five minutes? Remember the Simpsons character? Sometimes every three minutes.

232
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:26,900
It's like having a superpower. P every three minutes. This really is me. Well that's nice.

233
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:35,130
What is? What exactly are you doing here? Delivering videos. Take one. They're free.

234
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:43,900
Here we go. What's the story with these videos? Brady Culture's eyeball is the ocular fitness

235
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:47,900
regimen for people on the go. It's gonna be like a hypnotizing program where you get like all

236
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:55,690
fucked up and it makes you paint. I was gonna say giraffes but it's graffiti. That's the word.

237
00:32:55,690 --> 00:33:02,950
There's a lot of g's and a lot of f's in both those words. What can you tell me about eyeball?

238
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:09,430
Eyeball is a revolutionary new program of isometric exercises to promote ocular fitness.

239
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:16,309
You can learn to move even see through walls and clothing. What if I don't wear clothing?

240
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:25,799
You gotta watch this tape. It changed my life. All right. Who exactly is this Brady Culture fellow

241
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:31,400
supposed to be? And what kind of steroids does he use on his hair? Brady Culture is a genius

242
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,960
and his eyeball program is a boon to all mankind. Settle down Jeremy. You got the fucking you got

243
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:43,319
the intelligence like a large glass of water. And did you know 12 ounce iq? That's mine by the way.

244
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:53,740
I said that in pre-stream chat. It's a child star bonanza. You failed it. I was waiting. I was

245
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:59,740
waiting for an opportunity to use it. Hey you know you're brilliant. No you're brilliant. You

246
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:03,990
got the fucking iq like a glass of water. And then they're gonna be like what the fuck is he

247
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:08,280
talking about? And then on the car ride home. The car ride home they're gonna be going

248
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:25,000
wah fucking like 16 ounces that motherfucker. Well that's nice. What is? If you'll excuse us

249
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,360
we've got shopping to do. Take a copy of the eyeball video while you're at it. It will change

250
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,440
your life. We talked about that in the pre-stream chat. I'm glad I got a chance to say it.

251
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:52,039
12 ounce iq. All right so did I get a video? All right good. That joke is horrible. It doesn't

252
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:57,079
matter. I needed to say it. I am not getting in that thing again. It took me weeks to get

253
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:05,099
the fishy smell out of my fur. Tongues placed on freezer become property of Bosco. I got quite

254
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:13,179
a few tongues that week. Public restrooms. Unholy temples to all things unsanitary. I wouldn't go

255
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:20,940
in there for all the tea and tea landia. I'll do it. Tea landia. Lots of terror.

256
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:30,980
Uh oh. He's gonna pee his pants? Time out for number one. Looks like he opened his flood gates.

257
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:36,699
I hope he enjoys it as much as I did. He's playing terror. All right hold on he's not over here anymore.

258
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:46,420
Can we go over here? The crate that delivers Bosco's terror. I mean he's in the bathroom right now. I

259
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:53,380
wonder if I can do something. I don't like to use public restrooms actually.

260
00:35:54,340 --> 00:36:00,980
Land mines. What the fuck? Children preserve fluids. I wonder if Bosco used the fluid sample I

261
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:12,860
submitted. I hope not. What's over here? So what would I got? I got boxing glove bowling ball.

262
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:19,159
Yeah hold on. Get back uh get back in there.

263
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:37,500
Okay can I put the bowling ball in here? Like weigh him down?

264
00:36:38,139 --> 00:36:51,960
But wizard would take it and then where would I be? I was trying to like plant the gun in there.

265
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:58,659
I don't know why. Why would I want to like plant a gun?

266
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:08,679
I'll need a new skull but otherwise no complaints. Bosco is a gun free zone. Gun free? Sartre was

267
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:14,360
right. Purgatory really is a convenience store. Don't make me laugh little buddy. It jiggles my

268
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:22,539
sensitive cranium. Okay so I'm not sure I can do anything here because the crate that delivers

269
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:28,329
Bosco's terror. That's what he used to deliver. I think I'm gonna have to probably do.

270
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:36,730
I'm probably gonna have to put a tape. Okay I'm gonna have to put a tape in here

271
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:46,150
so he delivers it somewhere right? Oh hold on. Sliced cheese.

272
00:37:46,789 --> 00:37:53,110
Well it is on special and we are running dangerously low. Did I take it?

273
00:37:54,539 --> 00:38:00,619
Cheddar cheese this time. Okay a cheese sign on an empty table. The tantalizing promise of cheese

274
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:08,809
crushed by cruel reality. Lottery tickets. One dollar lottery tickets. Two dollars. I'm feeling

275
00:38:08,809 --> 00:38:17,750
lucky already. Time is it seven? Is that clock correct? Well it's only got one hand so probably

276
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:27,900
there was a minute hand. We're going to try anything. No trash? Hot weenies. Hot weenies.

277
00:38:31,179 --> 00:38:37,500
This rampant weenie cannibalism turns my stomach. Have I ever played Monkey Island? I have played

278
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:43,500
Monkey Island before. What do we have here? Organ trader? Self-loading weekly? Oh let me see that.

279
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:52,170
Hey Bosco what can I do for you? All right uh we want to we want to buy something. We'd like

280
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:56,969
to patronize your fine establishment my good man. By patronize you he means we want to buy

281
00:38:56,969 --> 00:39:01,849
stuff from you not mock you. We probably will mock you but that's not what he meant. I know

282
00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:08,969
what he meant. Don't patronize me. So what do you want to buy? Uh the cheese please. I was already

283
00:39:08,969 --> 00:39:18,090
doing it. I already bought it. What have you got? Well I still got that big sale on cheese. Oh yeah

284
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:24,010
cheese. I want that. And I might have another item of interest behind the counter. What do you got

285
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:28,090
behind the counter? What's my what is it? I accept your thinly veiled invitation to ask about the

286
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:32,650
item behind the counter. Oh it's just a little something I like to call a tear gas grenade

287
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:38,570
launcher. Tear gas grenade launcher? Oh yeah I really want that. It's the latest in Bosco tech

288
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:44,650
innovation. It'll clear out a room of militant college students in no time guaranteed. I feel

289
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:56,010
really close to you right now. You sell cheese in in a tear gas grenade launcher? Do you have

290
00:39:56,010 --> 00:40:05,989
any weasels on a stick? Nope. Do you have any two-handed broadswords? Nope. Do you have any

291
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:13,530
vegetables in the shape of famous naturalists? Nope. Do you have any candy pink fat boys? Nope.

292
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:21,420
Do you have any exiled political dissidents? Nope. Do you have any weapons of mass destruction?

293
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:30,150
Who's asking? Topical, topical humor. Do you have any topical? I've run out of ideas.

294
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:35,989
Well you can always just start over again. Good idea. Do you have do you have any weasels on the

295
00:40:35,989 --> 00:40:50,710
stick? Nope. 2002 2004 topical. I already took the cheese though didn't I? Did I have to pay for it?

296
00:40:55,769 --> 00:41:00,969
Okay Matt we want this cheese. Okay standard cheese background check. I'll need to see at

297
00:41:00,969 --> 00:41:06,250
least six forms of ID, a valid federal cheese license, a completed organ donor card, a written

298
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:09,929
release signed in the presence of a note of republic, and your school report cards from the

299
00:41:09,929 --> 00:41:15,130
ninth through twelfth grade. Uh oh. That's I can do all of those except the last one. It's okay Sam.

300
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:20,650
I can be brave. We'll just have to struggle cheeselessly onward. Do you guys remember bringing

301
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:29,059
into your report card into Chuck E. Cheese? You guys ever have that deal where if you had like

302
00:41:29,059 --> 00:41:35,510
A's? Yeah Chuck E. Cheese used to do this thing like 10-20 years ago where if you brought in your

303
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:42,789
report card and you had A's, straight A's, they would give you free tokens. They would give you

304
00:41:42,789 --> 00:41:50,309
a bonus tokens. So but what they didn't tell you is that really didn't matter because they didn't

305
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:55,269
want anybody to feel bad. So we would go in my mother... I was bad student so I didn't get like

306
00:41:55,909 --> 00:42:00,630
it wasn't A's and B's by the way. It was like uh S's or something for satisfactory

307
00:42:01,429 --> 00:42:05,590
needs improvement. There were only like three grades. A for like accomplished or something.

308
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:11,670
So I had a terrible report card but we still wanted to go to Chuck E. Cheese and we would go

309
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:16,789
and my mother would still try to get them to give the bonus credits for having a good report card

310
00:42:16,789 --> 00:42:21,210
and the guy behind the counter like just didn't give a shit. So like they they felt bad because

311
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:26,329
they would get my brother's report card and be like oh he's doing great free 20 free tokens

312
00:42:26,329 --> 00:42:34,730
and then they'd get mine and you could see the guy's face just be uh hey so good for you

313
00:42:35,699 --> 00:42:45,579
20 free tokens. I just got I got them just because they felt bad and I don't know maybe

314
00:42:45,579 --> 00:42:51,420
maybe my mother was like you give him both that you understand. I don't want him thinking that

315
00:42:51,420 --> 00:43:01,929
he's like fucking inadequate and the guy's just like okay yeah Chuck E. Cheese actually used to

316
00:43:01,929 --> 00:43:11,699
do that. We'd like that tear gas grenade launcher. That's really sad. What? 10,000 bucks. Sad? Give

317
00:43:11,699 --> 00:43:16,739
out like a million tickets. But I didn't know. I just thought we got free tokens. White collar

318
00:43:16,739 --> 00:43:22,420
crime drive. Where corporate criminals go to rejoice in their ill-gotten gains. After we

319
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:26,739
blow this popsicle stand we can go hunt us up one of those starchy cesspiles and hit them where it

320
00:43:26,739 --> 00:43:31,539
hurts the most. Right in the pocketbook. That's not what I thought you were gonna say but that's good

321
00:43:31,539 --> 00:43:46,099
too. The man got his token. Still a victory. That's right. I still got the tokens. Look my brother was

322
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:50,900
really smart and he like paid the token toll and then we just we're all part of the same family,

323
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:59,260
same groups. Give it to us all. Whatever. All right so I can't okay so nothing for us right now.

324
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:07,500
Okay can I put the cheese in here? See you later Bosco. Remember. What conversation? I just I just

325
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:13,500
accidentally skipped that. He's leeching off his brother. What conversation? Oh brother.

326
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:24,820
This is like a dumb like four dollar extra promotion to Chuck E. Cheese 20 years ago.

327
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:32,340
Oh wow I can't believe he did that to his brother. Unbelievable. He like conned his brother out of tokens.

328
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:54,420
Oh time out. Can I put the cheese in here? If you really love someone give them the cheese.

329
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:58,579
What does that do? Can't wait to see the look on his face when he gets it.

330
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:11,050
Oh he's trying to leave. I get it. Time out for number one. We're saved. That's a whole lot more

331
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:14,489
entertaining when it's not happening to me. It's pretty entertaining either way.

332
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:24,329
Hahaha. Oh he wet his widow pants. Who's talking? Is that Sam? Oh I was like what the fuck?

333
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:31,579
Good thing I have the other two twerps to handle it.

334
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:35,659
It's still not quite right.

335
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:40,699
Let me help you out here. You just gonna leave him there?

336
00:45:41,500 --> 00:46:04,119
Hahaha. Did it for you. Actually evil. So is it that's it? I don't want to wake him up. I got the

337
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:11,670
tape. We have to go watch the tape. Nothing else I can do over here. Bosco's got a lot of interesting

338
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:16,389
if questionable products in here. I think it's the only store in town where they carry those albino

339
00:46:16,389 --> 00:46:21,670
monkey crackers I got hooked on in Forneo. Let's get back to it. Why don't you get back to your

340
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:26,150
shopping or whatever it was you were doing that back there. Sometimes it's best not to ask.

341
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:31,190
I'll let you get back to doing what you're doing or whatever it is you do back there.

342
00:46:32,309 --> 00:46:38,809
Hey Bosco how are you? That's like Owen Wilson. Hey Bosco. Hey you just gonna leave him there?

343
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:51,619
Close. I'll get it. How about a reward? You know we did put the kibosh on that whole terrorist

344
00:46:51,619 --> 00:46:58,099
operation so. How about some free stuff? Is that why you did this? For free stuff? Was this

345
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:04,420
all a part of the plot? Yes a labyrinthine scheme in which we paid off a former child star to deliver

346
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:08,659
videos to your store just so that we could knock him out via your own security system and claim

347
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:16,949
an undeserved reward. So you admit it. Conspiracy humor may be lost on this crowd. So we don't get

348
00:47:16,949 --> 00:47:24,489
anything. Nice place you got here. Where's our stuff? What's so nice about it? Nice name. Nice

349
00:47:24,489 --> 00:47:28,969
security measures. Hey you got a good security. What's with the maximum security prison motif?

350
00:47:28,969 --> 00:47:34,730
You've been robbed as many times as I have you do to say. I've never been robbed actually but then I

351
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:39,210
typically point a large firearm at anyone who approaches me. You crack me up little buddy.

352
00:47:41,849 --> 00:47:51,980
Why that's a that's that you didn't even laugh. I don't I mean that's the line. I've heard he said

353
00:47:51,980 --> 00:48:02,599
the line right. I've heard that before but he didn't laugh. Not even like a you crack me up

354
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:10,679
little buddy. No no he didn't laugh. He's liar. What were we talking about? He's liar. No he's liar.

355
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:31,030
Sleep with two eyes open. He's being sarcastic. He's liar. This game looks like borderland. Hey

356
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:37,510
specs. Hey you remember when you were french? Um okay but let's watch the tape. We've got a

357
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:52,039
don't we all. Any other things to click on? That's the office. What about over here? One way. One way

358
00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:57,159
dead end. Street signs are such fitting metaphors for the human condition. Remind me to refill your

359
00:48:57,159 --> 00:49:05,449
prescriptions. Dead end sign. Uh let's go watch. Hold on let's go watch the tape. They say graffiti

360
00:49:05,449 --> 00:49:12,469
is the poetry of our time. I keep seeing giraffe like giraffe. Giraffe. I see the word giraffe. It's

361
00:49:12,469 --> 00:49:23,659
the font that's making me do that. It's the same word without the t's or something.

362
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:35,420
Or something. Let's watch the tape before I make a fool out of myself even more. Okay Max ready for

363
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:41,099
that ocular workout. No stop. We don't have any popcorn. Sweet alligator dentures soaking in

364
00:49:41,099 --> 00:49:49,590
formaldehyde. That was close. Quick before it starts. Hello I'm Brady culture. You may remember

365
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:56,070
me from culture's clubhouse. The massive worldwide television hit that ran for six episodes in 1970.

366
00:49:57,349 --> 00:50:05,269
What you are about to see will change your life forever. So watch closely. Now listen up you

367
00:50:05,349 --> 00:50:10,099
tasteless philistines. I knew I told you it was gonna be a hypnosis thing.

368
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:23,019
To name all your children after me. I love you. I adore you. I want to name all my children after

369
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:30,380
you. Sam look. Ocular fitness my eye. That videotape hypnotized Jimmy Tootie. I think I like him better

370
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:35,340
this way. We've got to find this Brady culture and stop it before he hypnotizes every consumer

371
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:40,460
of cheap self-help videos. Can I have his hair when we're done? Only if you keep it on a leash.

372
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:47,349
All right now we're time for some investigative work here. Let's check the entry. Nobody ever

373
00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:55,500
leaves us messages anymore. Can I call somebody? Can I call the chief? Send over another gargantuan

374
00:50:55,500 --> 00:51:03,130
anchovies and hot sauce special please. You know that's been a meme ever since the ninja turtles

375
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:10,260
anchovies on pizza but I've been told that it's actually fantastic.

376
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:28,860
That's the joke right? Anchovies. Apparently it's really really good. Okay so what can I get

377
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:36,460
should I take the tape back out? This is evidence right? I need to hold on to this. All right so we

378
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:44,619
know that this is a plot to hypnotize everybody and cause problems so anchovies on pizza are

379
00:51:44,619 --> 00:51:48,780
very normal here in Italy and are one of the classic pizzas in Napoli. Yeah see that's what

380
00:51:48,780 --> 00:52:00,539
I'm saying like I don't know where this meme joke came from. Okay there's another uh there's

381
00:52:00,539 --> 00:52:12,090
another there's another giraffe over there. Fishes are stinky and yucky. Meme know what?

382
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:21,619
They say graffiti is the poetry of our time. Just what we need more lame poetry. It's not a meme

383
00:52:21,619 --> 00:52:31,539
they just don't taste good. Meme is the word that everybody uses now. I would I'm just trying to fit

384
00:52:31,539 --> 00:52:38,599
in. This place used to be Lefty's tool rental shop. Good old Lefty. I'll miss him. You couldn't

385
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:44,440
stand Lefty. He once poked him in the eye with the number three socket spanner. Exactly. Good times.

386
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:56,809
How do you do fellow kids? Spray paint. Hey a can of spray paint and it's not even empty.

387
00:52:56,809 --> 00:53:06,699
So are we gonna go fuck with these paintings? Spray over it? This could use a little improvement.

388
00:53:12,519 --> 00:53:20,539
Hey hey hey you messed it up. Oh fix it Rainfreeze. Okay so that takes me away from the other one.

389
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:27,530
What what was he doing on the other one? Was he guarding something?

390
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:40,340
Is this some kind of currency thing? I don't know. They say graffiti is the poetry of our time.

391
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:48,599
Just what we need more lame poetry. You guys like got me all messed up with that improvement.

392
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:51,239
I keep seeing that and I just remember how many times I said it.

393
00:53:51,239 --> 00:53:59,340
What are you doing? Don't mess with my painting. I've got to fix it all up.

394
00:54:00,059 --> 00:54:08,199
Okay so I can make it. I can move him around. So he'll he's gonna fix that one. He'll run over

395
00:54:08,199 --> 00:54:15,530
and fix this one. Maybe okay so in stand here he goes really fast. I'm gonna hold the boxing glove

396
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:20,809
out and he's gonna run into my fist. And it's gonna break his like he's gonna fall down and

397
00:54:20,809 --> 00:54:23,849
it's gonna hurt him. But I didn't do it though. He just wasn't looking where he was going.

398
00:54:35,579 --> 00:54:42,090
Uh let's go first. Let me go in here first. Tempering with the mail is a federal offense

399
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:47,130
punishable by fine and imprisonment. As we found out after the incident with the garden hose.

400
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:56,980
Ah memories. I heard it was a little loud so I'm trying to get down.

401
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:05,530
Oh okay mailbox. This is Sybil's piercings tattoo psychic therapy.

402
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:23,579
Save it. Now it's too quiet. Oh let me check the alley way here. Is there any alley? No.

403
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:44,840
Car. Where are we going Sam? Let's go give a ticket to a rich criminal. Let's go cruise for

404
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:50,900
lawbreakers Max. And drive around. Are we getting Nicole Letagrade here? Is that possible?

405
00:55:59,159 --> 00:56:03,320
By the way Sam I'm not sure if I mentioned this but I may have accidentally chewed through our

406
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:08,920
brake lines. No I don't think you did mention that. I guess we'll just have to slow down by violently

407
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:22,329
rear-ending other motorists. Already planning on it little buddy. How do I? Oh I didn't know

408
00:56:22,329 --> 00:56:32,300
it is plus a full letter grade okay. Is there any consequences? Are there no consequences?

409
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:46,869
Take the wheel little buddy. Why can I do this? What? Please accept my condolences for your

410
00:56:46,869 --> 00:57:05,900
table line. This is so. Where am I supposed to go? Okay I just crashed into that guy.

411
00:57:06,539 --> 00:57:21,219
I'm still on the other side of the road. Office. I don't have anywhere else to go.

412
00:57:22,019 --> 00:57:29,659
You can use the keyboard to move. WASD doesn't do anything. Up down left right doesn't do anything.

413
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:38,900
I think this is I don't have I only have one destination which is the office area.

414
00:57:39,699 --> 00:57:53,269
That was all right that was pretty sick. We just drove around in a circle.

415
00:57:57,449 --> 00:58:07,369
Okay so I'm gonna deal with this guy somehow. Can I go I'm gonna go into Sybil's.

416
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:31,780
Delivering onions live. Not a great name. Another one. Welcome you look like you could use some

417
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:37,619
therapy. Not from a wide-eyed circus freak like you. Hey it's another one of the soda poppers. Me?

418
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:45,619
Right you're um. Peepers. I don't know what you're talking about. My name is Sybil Pandemic.

419
00:58:45,619 --> 00:58:54,789
Licensed psychotherapist. Fine prove it. About a little analysis. Certainly. Tell me what's bothering

420
00:58:54,789 --> 00:59:09,980
you. It's not me it's Max. Hey. He thinks he's a rabbit. I am a rabbit. See. Yes well I would

421
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:17,019
recommend Brady Culture's Ibo video for this situation. Good eye health helps combat delusions.

422
00:59:17,659 --> 00:59:24,619
I'm a rabbit. Ibo? Yes my runny poached egg-like eyes could use a workout. You won't regret it.

423
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:31,480
Okay well we already know what this is. Who's this lady culture person?

424
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:38,039
Brady. Brady Culture. He's only the most insightful and amazing man on the planet.

425
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:46,260
That's all. It's not Sean Penn? Not anymore. I'm so disillusioned. All right I know I've got I've

426
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:50,179
all right I got the video. Let me just see what you got. I've still got a copy of this cockamamie video.

427
00:59:50,179 --> 00:59:58,090
I'm all out but they probably still. Yeah. Well you're not Sybil. Are you sure your name is Sybil

428
00:59:58,090 --> 01:00:05,769
not Peepers? Absolutely. Sybil Pandemic licensed psychotherapist. That's me. He's trying to pull a

429
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:12,809
fast one Sam. Where's your gun? Violence is not the answer. Those eyes. Sam we're dealing with a

430
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:21,590
dangerously delusional psychotic here. Obviously. Uh we'll do all the options. Sybil's normally a

431
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:26,710
girl's name isn't it? Must have been tough while you were growing up. Why do you think I became a

432
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:33,559
licensed psychotherapist? You have any ID? Could we see your driver's license or some sort of ID?

433
01:00:33,559 --> 01:00:39,239
Sybil. My psychotherapy license is hanging over there on the wall. How about something with a

434
01:00:39,239 --> 01:00:45,480
picture on it you obvious lunatic you? I could draw one on there if it would put your mind at ease.

435
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:52,619
Draw one? Oddly I don't think it would. You sure look like Peepers. You're a dead ringer for Peepers from that old

436
01:00:52,619 --> 01:00:59,659
soda popper show. I get that a lot but I'm Sybil Pandemic licensed psychotherapist. Right.

437
01:01:03,099 --> 01:01:11,260
Excuse me for a minute would you? Let's take a look at this. Diplomas, uh tattoo chair.

438
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:21,590
I don't know what I have for items. Punching bag, bowling ball, spray paint, cactus. It's eerily

439
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:29,980
lifelike for a fake plant. The same could be said for a lot of our friends. It's eerily lifelike for

440
01:01:30,059 --> 01:01:39,400
the same. Yep. Yep. Yep. All right. What about the desk? Newton's balls. Can I play with that?

441
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:47,269
Oh it's good exercise for the eyes but Brady culture's eyeball video is better. Can I play with

442
01:01:47,269 --> 01:01:58,199
that? That voice is familiar. Ah the tiki. Hold over from the days when you could sell all kinds

443
01:01:58,199 --> 01:02:04,840
of cheap crap without a successful children's television show. Envious? A little. Okay intercom.

444
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:12,920
Hello is anybody there? Can't check the desk. Oh what about okay I want to go in the in the

445
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:19,239
closet there. I think those might be iron-ons. Convenient and painful. A sure-fire hit with

446
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:25,960
the average consumer. An iron-on tattoo? That looks comfortable. Oh it is. How would you know? You

447
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:34,550
don't have a tattoo. Don't I? Relax. That may be the least relaxing sign I've ever seen. Relax.

448
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:39,670
How about the one at the barbershop that says low fatality rate? I stand corrected. Oh I would

449
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:46,469
never let somebody shave me. I have this extreme fear of being shaved by somebody. No I don't think

450
01:02:46,469 --> 01:02:54,150
so. Skin art. Is that art for skin or art made from skin? Your ideas are effervescent pustules

451
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:59,510
Max. I have this extreme fear and it's completely irrational and you can judge me all you want

452
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:04,070
but I imagine myself sitting in the barber chair and talking to whoever it is that's

453
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:13,460
shaving me currently and they just like and I'm just dead. I don't know why I just always think

454
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:28,760
about that. It's completely irrational. Sweetie talk yeah there's too many forms of media of that.

455
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:44,230
Plus I have a very sensitive face. I gotta be very careful like I use a very specific particular

456
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:54,489
razor. If I go and do a like a hot shave and they're just like I cut up there I cut easily

457
01:03:54,489 --> 01:04:04,340
on my face. I know no they get like the thing they have a towel and they have that piece of

458
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:12,260
leather that they take the big knife it's like a machete and they go put your head back.

459
01:04:12,739 --> 01:04:29,190
It's scary. I'm sure it's nice. Thank god I've been locked in that closet so long I was

460
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:34,230
starting to invent life stories for the mothballs. The leather is the skin from the last guy. Oh my

461
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:40,869
god he's still here? Call a cop. You're in luck ma'am. Sam and Max we're freelance police. What the

462
01:04:40,869 --> 01:04:45,829
civil pandemic licensed psychotherapist nice to know you. Arrest that lunatic immediately.

463
01:04:46,789 --> 01:04:55,909
But he's my pal. What's the charge? Assault, kidnapping, identity theft. Those are good

464
01:04:55,909 --> 01:05:01,829
charges. Some of my favorites and what about mopery? He locked me in the closet and he's been

465
01:05:01,829 --> 01:05:09,269
pretending he's me. Gadzooks why? Well these cases can be very complicated and delicate.

466
01:05:09,269 --> 01:05:14,789
There may be repressed feelings of inadequate transference or latent unwarranted hypochondriac

467
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:21,429
Freudianism. Come again? He's a complete whack job although actually now that I look closely

468
01:05:21,429 --> 01:05:29,429
I think he's been hypnotized. Oh really? What can we do? Are there steps we can take? Soothing music

469
01:05:29,429 --> 01:05:35,110
or perhaps some sort of invasive surgery? Shock treatment! Shock treatment! Typically a hypnotic

470
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:41,030
state can be revised after rendering the subject susceptible to new input. Sorry I don't speak

471
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:45,030
psychotherapist. You've got to knock them unconscious to bring them out of it.

472
01:05:47,989 --> 01:05:54,329
I can demonstrate on this guy if you'll knock him out for me. Consider it done. I thought he's

473
01:05:54,329 --> 01:06:01,530
just gonna go do it. All right so here this is what we've got this for. I can see you. Whoa

474
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:10,380
where'd he go? Hey there he is. You a therapist? How could you? Just comes naturally I guess.

475
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:19,059
Okay so we're gonna knock him out. How do we knock you out?

476
01:06:25,059 --> 01:06:57,400
Whip the door open really fast and hit him right in the head with it? I can see you. He runs. I can

477
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:03,559
see. Whoa where'd he go? Hey there he is. All right how do we keep him here? How do we keep him from

478
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:35,559
moving? Where's he running to? I can see you. What can you tell me about this? Oh it's marbles.

479
01:07:35,639 --> 01:07:39,239
Change my life. You should watch it as soon as you possibly can.

480
01:07:43,289 --> 01:07:54,170
I have the strangest urge to redecorate. Fight it Sam. Fight it. Okay like spray him. I don't think

481
01:07:54,170 --> 01:08:04,329
that would be in. All right what are you telling me? Hello. I meant the other civil. So you guys

482
01:08:04,329 --> 01:08:12,760
gonna take care of this imposter or what? Just throw the phone at him. I think there may be other

483
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:17,720
victims of hypnosis besides yours lurking around the neighborhood. Make that really really cool

484
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:28,359
unconscious as well. Oh boy when it comes off the latch it goes like it's a great audio cue

485
01:08:28,359 --> 01:08:33,430
for a lot of things. What happened to your tattoo business? Don't tell me they actually

486
01:08:33,430 --> 01:08:38,789
enforce those health code violations. No no of course they don't but a guy came in here and

487
01:08:38,789 --> 01:08:44,710
asked me to put a ship on his chest and I misheard him and well I decided to hang it up after that.

488
01:08:45,670 --> 01:08:53,739
Okay I don't think I've ever been in here. You're right across the street from us and I don't think

489
01:08:53,739 --> 01:08:58,939
I've ever been in here before today. Your friend has. He's always trying to con me into giving him

490
01:08:58,939 --> 01:09:04,140
some kind of weird tattoo for free. You could put a line on my head and some eyes on my butt

491
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:13,909
and I look like I was upside down. For the last time no. Excuse us we've got work to do. I'll say.

492
01:09:13,989 --> 01:09:19,420
All right let me what about the couch? Let me look at the couch.

493
01:09:22,069 --> 01:09:25,829
I've got half a mind to stretch out. I think you have to stretch the whole thing

494
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:33,270
or it rips. You baffle me. You crack me up sometimes Max. You make me laugh Max.

495
01:09:33,989 --> 01:09:39,880
All right let's get out of here. Let me try to deal with the other guy. I think I need something

496
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:55,539
else. What do I have for items? Bowling ball, boxing glove, videotape, spray paint. So I can spray paint

497
01:09:55,539 --> 01:10:06,310
that. Can I go faster? Somebody said that I could double click. I'm not doing it.

498
01:10:09,659 --> 01:10:20,090
Because he's here and then he runs that way. What is he standing on here? Can I like drop him through

499
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:36,840
this? Shift click. No. Well let me paint the graffiti here. Let me just see what happens.

500
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:47,510
That gets him away from there. But I'm not sure what that does. Because that just gets him over

501
01:10:47,510 --> 01:11:02,729
here. So now I can't just like punch him in the back of the head.

502
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:42,680
So they move so fast. All right so then there's another one. Wait there's two. There's one here

503
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:56,680
too. Okay so there's three.

504
01:12:14,659 --> 01:12:20,100
I didn't see this. I forgot this one existed. Because then that means now he's over here.

505
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:40,409
Okay yeah watch this. He's gonna be right here. And that's when we shoot him. I'm kidding. I'm

506
01:12:40,409 --> 01:12:49,529
kidding. I'm kidding. I know. I know. I know. I know. Can you believe we get paid for this?

507
01:12:50,569 --> 01:12:56,569
I love this country. This would actually kill somebody. Like he's dead. He made me mess up.

508
01:12:57,850 --> 01:13:04,010
That's the last words that person's ever gonna say. Now this is quality television.

509
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:13,100
Except my evil plan is in jeopardy. That person's skull crushed down into their spine. And their

510
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:14,539
brain was disintegrated.

511
01:13:24,779 --> 01:13:30,550
That's two. So the third one. How do I knock out the third one?

512
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:39,909
What do I got? It's definitely something to do with this. Something to do with the boxing glove.

513
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:44,710
Put it somewhere that he runs into or let me go let me go look at the body.

514
01:13:45,670 --> 01:14:02,859
He'll be out for a good while. Yeah forever actually.

515
01:14:03,659 --> 01:14:17,289
He'll be out forever. Is there anything else down here? Takes me back to my childhood. Okay we got

516
01:14:17,289 --> 01:14:24,090
more. We got stinky's. Stinky's diner. I can't go there. What with the van?

517
01:14:38,779 --> 01:14:46,699
This one's this guy's dead too. What are you doing? Hey Bosco. Hey you just gonna leave him there?

518
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:58,619
Uh we want to buy something. What do you got your eye on? We'd like that tear gas grenade launcher.

519
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:03,819
That'll be ten thousand dollars. Oh were you serious about that? It's a bargain. Trust me.

520
01:15:03,819 --> 01:15:08,859
Trust me. I never trust a man that says trust me twice. We gotta find an illegally wealthy

521
01:15:08,859 --> 01:15:17,739
motorist and quick. Nothing. Okay so we gotta go. Thanks Bosco. Rest somebody for money and then

522
01:15:17,739 --> 01:15:28,630
get the money and get the tear gas. I'm gonna go. How am I gonna get ten thousand dollars in tickets?

523
01:15:39,369 --> 01:15:45,699
Just one big ticket. Where we going Sam? That's a lot. All right let's go give a ticket. That's

524
01:15:45,699 --> 01:16:02,890
where that's for. All right here we go. Okay so we gotta pull over somewhere by running into them.

525
01:16:03,689 --> 01:16:16,359
Like this guy. All right you're under arrest. This is your first and final warning. Pull over or die.

526
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:26,920
Click on the report card. Get doped. And you're not Ergo. We call the shops around here.

527
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:38,569
Oh why did you stop me? Hideously broken tail light. Indecent exposure. We're booking you sorry

528
01:16:38,569 --> 01:16:45,050
hide for indecent exposure. What are you talking about? I'm fully clothed. Accept your face. Get

529
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:53,829
a veil please. Let's go Max. Having that face is punishment enough. That's two cops. Two police

530
01:16:53,829 --> 01:16:58,949
officers say that to you. No one seems to be breaking the law today. I know what's the problem.

531
01:16:58,949 --> 01:17:04,310
Start committing some crimes you sick bunch of reprobates. Hey you're naked. No I'm not. Well

532
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:25,000
you're ugly. Bye. Okay have a nice day officer. Jesus. What about you? Pull over or we'll be

533
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:35,800
forced to destroy your car. Greetings anonymous motorist. If you were planning to bribe us

534
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:43,590
now would be the appropriate time. What's the charge? Uh hideously broken worshiping false

535
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:49,829
idols ferret impression. This no nothing at all. Uh broken tail light. Your tail light's busted.

536
01:17:49,829 --> 01:17:55,510
No it isn't. Well maybe it should be. Mental note. Try to pull over suspects who are actually guilty

537
01:17:55,510 --> 01:18:12,220
of something. Again what terrible cops. Imagine a cop had to make a mental note out loud in front

538
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:17,100
of you that you didn't do anything wrong and they need to pull over for the did things wrong.

539
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:28,739
Well how am I supposed to tell him? He was doing something illegal. We're doing illegal shit. Nobody

540
01:18:28,739 --> 01:18:43,859
else is. I can't like break it? That didn't break his tail light? How is me crashing into

541
01:18:43,859 --> 01:19:01,539
somebody not break their tail light? Sam one tail light zero. Well just gonna bulk it. Do this all

542
01:19:01,539 --> 01:19:25,770
day. God pull over. You have two broken tail lights. Hello sir or madam. You're in big trouble mister

543
01:19:25,770 --> 01:19:34,220
or miss. For what? Your tail light's busted. Well you're the ones who broke it. Your point being

544
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:43,979
what's the fine for a broken tail light? $10,000. Why isn't it $10,000? What are you crazy? What? Oh

545
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:50,470
one moment allow me to confer with my legal counsel. My attorney has advised me to pay the

546
01:19:50,470 --> 01:20:17,300
fine. What kind of inflation is the economy to happen to you? Bad. Jesus. All right I got 10 grand.

547
01:20:24,279 --> 01:20:29,159
Yeah you gotta figure if you would just pay that fine something fucked up is really going on in

548
01:20:29,159 --> 01:20:39,270
your current life. You will have to be like a super criminal. This probably like a $500,000

549
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:47,899
worth of cocaine in that person's car or something. I got a million dollars in fucking like cocaine

550
01:20:47,899 --> 01:20:53,340
in this car. That'll be $10,000. Okay yeah doesn't mean you're gonna leave me alone. Yeah okay bye.

551
01:20:54,060 --> 01:21:07,140
Hey Bosco. Hey that's the only reason why that makes sense. We want to buy something. What do you

552
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:14,949
got your eye on? We got your tear gas money right here. Really? All right here you go. One tear gas

553
01:21:14,949 --> 01:21:22,329
grenade launcher. This is a salad shooter filled with onions. But it works. Trust me. Trust me.

554
01:21:22,409 --> 01:21:29,739
Now put that away before someone gets hurt. What do you mean? The 10,000 just covered the cost

555
01:21:29,739 --> 01:21:40,699
of materials you know. Oh I'm sure. It's okay everybody. I'm all right. Well you knew there

556
01:21:40,699 --> 01:21:48,710
was a kind of it had to be a gag there somewhere. It's an onion. It's a salad. It's an onion shooter.

557
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:58,229
It's tear gas. It'll make you cry. When we shoot this at the shoot the onion at the

558
01:21:59,189 --> 01:22:11,979
popper's face. Watch him cry and then punch him. Is this just going to be a one-off or

559
01:22:11,979 --> 01:22:17,289
I'm going to play the rest of the game? I'm open to play the rest of the season.

560
01:22:22,739 --> 01:22:27,859
This is cool. I'm just just hanging out. It's like a relaxing little experience. It's yeah I like it.

561
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:35,350
Oh Sybil. Yes. Uh the other Sybil. What is that? Don't worry this won't hurt a bit.

562
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:57,829
But it will make you cry. He's already crying. I can see you. What? Hey there he is. You attack

563
01:22:57,829 --> 01:23:05,460
just comes naturally. They got a big fail safe in the game's engine here to make that not possible.

564
01:23:06,439 --> 01:23:22,739
Oh Sybil. Now Peepers this is going to hurt us a lot more than it's going to hurt you.

565
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:30,340
Just kidding. It'll definitely hurt you more. Sweet dreams Peeps. I can see you.

566
01:23:31,699 --> 01:23:39,140
Oh my that was great. That was great. Wait a second. My evil plan is in ruins.

567
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:44,659
The dog and bunny will rue the day they crossed me. Rue the day I say.

568
01:23:44,659 --> 01:23:54,520
That was good. That was really good this time. Now I can try to bring him out of his hypnotic state.

569
01:23:55,239 --> 01:24:02,119
Take control of your mind. I don't think he can hear you. Sure he can. He's unconscious. Not dead.

570
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:11,800
Minor detail. Destroy the intruder in your dreams. Regain control. What? Hey what am I doing here?

571
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:17,960
What's going on? Wait can we get him to sing the song? My name's not Sybil. It's Peepers.

572
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:29,079
Oh yes it is. Are you okay? How do you feel? I've got a weirdest dream. And there was someone

573
01:24:29,079 --> 01:24:37,159
unusual in your dream wasn't there? Yes Brady Culture was there. He kept telling me to do stuff.

574
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:44,600
Aha. I knew it. That fiend hypnotized you to do his unspeakable bidding. Peepers what's the last

575
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:51,560
thing you can remember? I remember checking in at Brady Culture's home for former child stars.

576
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:56,760
He has his own nut house? Wow we gotta meet this guy. Where can we find this home for former child

577
01:24:56,760 --> 01:25:03,880
stars? Oh it's very secret. No one must ever find it. Think of a scandal. Five o'clock shadow? But we need

578
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:08,760
to find it so we can stop the madness. I thought he was like huffing spray paint. I want to help but

579
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:17,399
I just can't remember where it is. Oh brothers might. They went with me. Hey I didn't do anything

580
01:25:17,399 --> 01:25:29,800
really embarrassing did I? Nothing a simple exorcism can't fix. Oh dear. Witness him.

581
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:39,220
All right let's do it. So wait is there anything else I can do in here? Do you have anything else

582
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:46,180
for me? Hey doc. Hey Sam thanks for taking care of that wacko. Oh we could use another 10 grand.

583
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:51,939
Have you got 10 grand? I'm new at this. I have a lot of student loans. Great loan us a student. I

584
01:25:51,939 --> 01:26:00,060
can ride it around like a pony. It's nice to see you show such enthusiasm. Security. You don't have

585
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:06,340
security back there. That button's not connected to anything. Max might like a tattoo. Oh yeah I

586
01:26:06,340 --> 01:26:11,140
want a map of the Netherlands on my Netherlands. I get the cold shivers just thinking about

587
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:16,659
remembering hearing you say that. I'm out of the tattoo business anyway. I'm a licensed psychotherapist.

588
01:26:17,619 --> 01:26:24,149
Can you fix cars? Ours sometimes makes a noise like an orangutan with the dry heaves. Um that's

589
01:26:24,149 --> 01:26:29,670
my fault. I've been keeping an orangutan in the trunk. Oh never mind. I'm not much of a mechanic

590
01:26:29,670 --> 01:26:35,609
anyway except with unicycles. All right well let's get an analyst. I suppose you could psychoanalyze

591
01:26:35,609 --> 01:26:41,529
me. Hey yeah I could count your marbles for you. I have a license you know. Will this be painful?

592
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:45,770
Only if we do it right. Now there are a couple things we can try. We could look at some ink

593
01:26:45,850 --> 01:26:49,850
plots. We could try some free association. I could interpret your dreams for you.

594
01:26:51,689 --> 01:26:56,729
Let's try ink plot. How do ink blots work? And can we make them ourselves? It's easy. I just

595
01:26:56,729 --> 01:27:02,010
show you some pictures and you tell me what you see. Your responses can reveal things like

596
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:08,409
obsessions or obsessions. Let's get psychoanalyzed on screen. Take a look at this and tell me what

597
01:27:08,409 --> 01:27:17,829
you see. Uh that's Goro from Mortal Kombat about to do a fatality to me. It's a point of view.

598
01:27:20,659 --> 01:27:29,430
See he's like fucking running at me. Uh okay pennies on the eyes of a dead mime. I don't see

599
01:27:29,430 --> 01:27:37,239
a pair of oxen boxing in a rowboat. I don't see that either. Susan Lucci holding an emmy.

600
01:27:39,189 --> 01:27:45,560
I don't see that either. The results of the last time I let Max drive. I mean that's it could be

601
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:57,050
like like flat. The results of the last time I let Max drive. All right now how about this one?

602
01:27:57,850 --> 01:28:05,350
Okay without even looking. This is two old ladies. These are two old ladies with their hands up. So

603
01:28:05,350 --> 01:28:10,949
they see like the big bun hair. Two cigarettes. Two old ladies back to back about to do a duel

604
01:28:10,949 --> 01:28:15,909
with cameras. They're selfie dueling. That's what I see first of all first and foremost before I

605
01:28:15,909 --> 01:28:22,760
look at anything. Okay a bunch of bacteria playing basketball. I don't see that. Pigeons

606
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:30,649
on at the marquee at a man's chinese theater. No an SUV crashing into an opulent mansion.

607
01:28:31,909 --> 01:28:44,699
No the st valentine's day. I no I don't see any. I see like a mustache. No none of this is right.

608
01:28:45,340 --> 01:29:07,609
Pigeons on the marquee. No SUV. I would probably. Pigeons I guess. Pigeons on the marquee at man's

609
01:29:07,609 --> 01:29:17,369
chinese theater. And this. All right what do I see first of all without looking at it? This is

610
01:29:19,779 --> 01:29:23,460
this looks like some type of satan or something. Like see like the face. Two eyes. Nose.

611
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:30,939
Just looming. Hovering over what looks to be potentially. This is the body. Maybe a body.

612
01:29:31,819 --> 01:29:37,079
Like it's a goat head. Goat satan. Goat. It's just satan because it's like the legs and like

613
01:29:37,079 --> 01:29:49,989
the arms and shit. Or it could be multiple entities at the same time. Or like a scorpion

614
01:29:49,989 --> 01:30:05,000
or something. A squirrel that got run over twice. Now this one. What do you see? Okay this one

615
01:30:06,229 --> 01:30:15,260
again I see two. It's either okay it's either uh oros from world of warcraft. Like the light

616
01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:22,619
things. Some of you will get that. Or there's another it's the nose. The face. His hand coming

617
01:30:22,619 --> 01:30:31,079
out like to dancing like dueling dancing to like circus performers or back to back here

618
01:30:31,079 --> 01:30:47,619
with doing selfie selfie uh duels. The exhaust manifold of a bread truck. And this one. Uh this

619
01:30:47,619 --> 01:30:59,060
is a pokemon. This is when it goes like doo doo doo. And it zooms in and then it fades into color

620
01:30:59,619 --> 01:31:08,520
and they go like. Mujito. That's the only thing I can see. There's been somebody fucked up

621
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:12,439
pokemons. I guarantee if you superimpose a pokemon that looks like this on it they're

622
01:31:12,439 --> 01:31:25,000
they're out of like the 16 000 pokemon that exist now. One of these matches. Pokemon

623
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:32,100
is the simpsons of monster character creation. If you think you made up something they already

624
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:38,409
have done it. It's just that joke. Do you oh you have like an original monster animal thing that

625
01:31:38,409 --> 01:31:42,810
you've drawn. No there's a pokemon. There's already like 30 000 of a database has been made.

626
01:31:43,529 --> 01:31:56,090
A war between two teams of abstract shapes. You seem fairly focused on cars but it's probably

627
01:31:56,090 --> 01:32:06,220
nothing to worry about anymore. Thanks doc. Wait what? What's free association like? It's a test of

628
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:11,100
your reactions to things in your life. I say a word and then you just say or do the first thing

629
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:15,979
that comes into your head. Okay. Dance a samba. Recite the alphabet. Scream at the top of my lungs.

630
01:32:15,979 --> 01:32:23,899
That sort of thing. Interesting. Have we started already? No but now we will. Ready? Is that the

631
01:32:23,899 --> 01:32:39,750
word? No the word is tumbleweed. Vegas. Oh uh uh uh eucalyptus. Eucalyptus. Interesting. Now try

632
01:32:39,750 --> 01:32:50,710
this one. Crown. King. Just do or say whatever comes naturally. Frozen concentrated orange juice.

633
01:32:50,710 --> 01:33:01,609
I see. Comb. Hair. That's not so basic. A pomade. Promenade. What an unusual response.

634
01:33:01,609 --> 01:33:07,289
Well this has been illuminating. What's the verdict? I'll let you know after years of insanely

635
01:33:07,289 --> 01:33:12,170
expensive treatment. Anything to support small local businesses. We can always sell organs on

636
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:19,050
the black market to raise the cash. Just so they're not ours little buddy. No I would dream. This is

637
01:33:19,050 --> 01:33:28,279
okay I want to do. Does this exist? Can I take like a total like evaluation somewhere online?

638
01:33:28,279 --> 01:33:33,159
I want to do this whole thing like like three hours. Can you really learn anything from my

639
01:33:33,159 --> 01:33:39,399
grotesque nonsensical dreams? Oh absolutely. They reveal your subconscious. It's like peeling an

640
01:33:39,399 --> 01:33:45,399
onion. Now just relax and try to remember your dream. Yeah I want to stream it. Okay here goes.

641
01:33:46,439 --> 01:33:52,359
Remember your dream. My dreams always start in the office but this time things were different.

642
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:57,319
Yes I can picture it. Tell me what happens. It's called Buzzfeed quizzes.

643
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:04,359
No I'm talking about like a real. I realized there was someone else in the room with me.

644
01:34:04,359 --> 01:34:10,600
Like this costs money and I go get analyzed with a bunch of blots and ink tests and

645
01:34:11,399 --> 01:34:14,039
questions and that kind of fast responses and we'll see what they do.

646
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:23,220
This is me. It was me. You? Hmm I think you represent yourself.

647
01:34:23,859 --> 01:34:29,220
I didn't even realize that was possible. Oh sure any crazy thing's possible in psychoanalysis.

648
01:34:30,020 --> 01:34:37,060
Tell me did the other you say or do anything unexpected? No the usual. Hi Sam how are you?

649
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:43,460
I'm fine Sam and yourself. Not too shabby. Fascinating. Where does your mind come up with

650
01:34:43,460 --> 01:34:51,220
this stuff? See I told you me and Sam I get that vibe completely with this because you know like

651
01:34:51,220 --> 01:35:03,130
hair comb. I didn't notice anything. Then why do you mention it? I don't know. Interesting.

652
01:35:03,130 --> 01:35:13,989
I wanted the trash. Me then trash then the board. I noticed something bizarre in the closet.

653
01:35:13,989 --> 01:35:18,229
Yes we put things in the closet we want to hide away things we're ashamed of.

654
01:35:18,229 --> 01:35:23,270
Please Sam what's in your closet? A bunch of a bunch of shit stained underwear that I don't

655
01:35:23,270 --> 01:35:30,460
want anyone to see. A whole stack of lottery tickets. Interesting perhaps you feel you don't

656
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:35,899
really earn your money. Don't worry lady we get paid to crack skulls and by that measure we

657
01:35:35,899 --> 01:35:47,210
ought to be millionaires. I noticed something bizarre in the closet. Ah something you're ashamed

658
01:35:47,210 --> 01:35:55,130
of. What was it? No that's fine lottery tickets. A whole stack of lottery tickets. Don't worry lady.

659
01:35:56,840 --> 01:36:01,319
All right what else? I tell you sometimes I forget that I'm just like live and I just

660
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:09,239
that I'm streaming. I remembered that I'd just gotten something from the bakery.

661
01:36:09,239 --> 01:36:14,039
Oh sounds like you and your special guest there were having a little lottery ticket today.

662
01:36:16,409 --> 01:36:19,609
I got a birthday cake, a wedding cake, a fruit cake, a cheesecake.

663
01:36:23,699 --> 01:36:29,539
It was a cheesecake and I mean literally a piece of cheese and a cake. What does that represent?

664
01:36:29,539 --> 01:36:37,779
No that doesn't mean anything. It's just random nonsense. That's good. One cheesecake for every

665
01:36:37,779 --> 01:36:48,149
death in Sekiro. Sounds good Sam. What else is here? Out the window? I prepared to leap out of the

666
01:36:48,149 --> 01:36:55,050
window. Oh was that the end of your dream? Yes. Yep then I woke up screaming. I can see why.

667
01:36:59,210 --> 01:37:05,979
Let's examine my obsessions with inkblots. Let's examine my okay hold on. Wait didn't I already do

668
01:37:05,979 --> 01:37:10,220
some more ink blots? Oh and more ink blots. Sure let's take a look at this and tell me.

669
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:17,369
Oh we already did it never mind. Oh shit how do I get out of here? The result. All right now.

670
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:44,039
Pitch. And this. A squirt. Now this one. The. And this one. A warby. But it's probably. Next up.

671
01:37:44,039 --> 01:37:47,800
I got them all. Let's go. Actually let's save the psychoanalysis for later.

672
01:37:48,359 --> 01:37:57,750
Hmm. Postponing responsibilities. Interesting. Okay so now we can get out of here. Probably.

673
01:37:59,449 --> 01:38:04,729
That's it for the three um. Unless that's the wrong way. He's instinctively going over there.

674
01:38:04,729 --> 01:38:09,850
His dream. Remember the lottery tickets? You guys have fucking analyzed. Oh stop analyzing me.

675
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:37,270
Don't get out of here. Get out of my head. Okay so now we go back to the office. He thinks he's

676
01:38:37,350 --> 01:38:47,239
streaming right now. Interesting. Where? They're very weird. He's talking out loud while lying down

677
01:38:47,239 --> 01:39:02,069
on his back. In the bed. Is he still hypnotized? Tiny hoodlums. No comment.

678
01:39:04,310 --> 01:39:11,510
Uh anything on tv? On this week's edition of oh is he still alive? We look at the stars of the

679
01:39:11,510 --> 01:39:17,670
1970s television hit the soda poppers. I love shows that destroy all our cherished delusions

680
01:39:17,670 --> 01:39:24,390
about the stars we once loved. He's dead. During the soda poppers heyday young specks was the

681
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:29,909
role model for obsessive neat freaks all over the globe. Ticker tape free ticker tape parades were

682
01:39:29,909 --> 01:39:35,270
thrown in honor of the soda popper who never missed a spot. Backstage though things were

683
01:39:35,270 --> 01:39:40,310
quite a bit dirtier. Speck's obsession with perfection caused massive delays in shooting

684
01:39:40,310 --> 01:39:46,949
and infuriated co-workers. He famously demanded over 11 000 retakes of the line. You made me mess

685
01:39:47,430 --> 01:39:52,229
up. Made all the more annoying because of his tendency to repeat the line immediately after

686
01:39:52,229 --> 01:39:57,989
reading it. Following the show specks was rarely seen in public. Although he did make one ill-fated

687
01:39:57,989 --> 01:40:03,989
venture into celebrity tag team mud wrestling. Getting on this show someday. As he desperately

688
01:40:03,989 --> 01:40:09,430
tried to wipe down the ring with a dish rag. The meltdown utterly enraged his tag team partner

689
01:40:09,430 --> 01:40:14,869
and good friend the dog from my mother the dog who stormed out of the arena without a word.

690
01:40:14,869 --> 01:40:19,909
They haven't spoken since. Coming up next the soda popper who couldn't always keep it in.

691
01:40:23,829 --> 01:40:32,840
Well that was okay. Mother of the dog for jerma rumble. Hey tough settle down all right now

692
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:45,239
everybody has to join. Where are we going Sam? Settle down all right let's waste precious time

693
01:40:45,239 --> 01:40:56,300
driving around aimlessly. Let's go cruise for lawbreakers Max. Goodie. Pretty Sam and Max tag

694
01:40:56,300 --> 01:41:17,000
team though. That seems really possible doesn't it? If it's good enough if I like it. Do I drive

695
01:41:17,000 --> 01:42:02,310
to a new area? Is this the only the only three locations I can do right now? Where'd the popper

696
01:42:02,310 --> 01:42:27,640
go? Where'd popper? What is this one? Take control of your mind. I have to like say the line. Is it working? I don't know

697
01:42:28,199 --> 01:42:34,039
destroy the intruder in your dreams. Snap out of it you big baby. What what's going on?

698
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:42,039
Why is my outfit all wrinkled? He's back. Quick act like a chicken. No tell us where we can find

699
01:42:42,039 --> 01:42:47,319
radio culture's home for former child stars. We've got to stop that fiend from hypnotizing anyone else.

700
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:55,079
The home it's 227 something. Wizard would remember this. All right let's go wake up wizard.

701
01:42:55,800 --> 01:43:05,000
Can you take us there? Are you kidding? I've got hours hours of iron. Well that was helpful.

702
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:29,829
What am I doing? Hello. Oh sorry I was doing Donald Duck. I was trying to for a second. Take

703
01:43:29,829 --> 01:43:34,390
control of your mind. Destroy the intruder in your dreams. It's not gonna happen though. Nicely done

704
01:43:34,390 --> 01:43:43,829
Sam. You're a natural. Where am I? Who are you? Don't worry we're freelance police. Police? Oh no.

705
01:43:44,229 --> 01:43:54,579
Oh hey. He's getting away in that truck. Quick follow that soda popper. Oh okay.

706
01:43:55,460 --> 01:43:59,750
Driving sequence. Hurry Sam he's getting away.

707
01:44:00,470 --> 01:44:12,789
Oh dropping trash. It's actually kind of hard to tune at the mouse.

708
01:44:49,210 --> 01:44:51,399
Come here.

709
01:45:01,479 --> 01:45:16,869
Got it. Yes. I got it. Don't shoot. Aside from the fact that we just plugged your truck

710
01:45:16,869 --> 01:45:22,149
why would you think we'd shoot you? Except for the obvious sport value of course. It's just you

711
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:26,949
always see cops on the news beating up some guy just because he's a former child star.

712
01:45:27,510 --> 01:45:31,989
We would never dream of hurting former child stars. We just need to find the home where Brady

713
01:45:31,989 --> 01:45:38,390
Culture keeps them. Oh why didn't you say so? It's right over there across the street.

714
01:45:38,390 --> 01:45:48,229
Jumping elephant fleas. How devilishly convenient. Thanks. Um does anyone know where I can find a

715
01:45:48,229 --> 01:46:05,560
bathroom? Here we go. The four Brady Cultures home for former child stars. Where to go first?

716
01:46:06,279 --> 01:46:13,239
Mall man. Looks like a shifty character to me. Don't they all? I think someone was sitting here.

717
01:46:13,239 --> 01:46:22,310
And leaking. Okay other door admission forms. Hmm it says here they only treat patients with

718
01:46:22,310 --> 01:46:28,390
something called artificial personality disorder. Sounds tasty. What's in it? Apparently it's common

719
01:46:28,390 --> 01:46:35,189
in former child stars. Symptoms include uh let's see obsession with money, violent reactions to

720
01:46:35,189 --> 01:46:40,949
dentistry, and an unconscious desire to see one's peers getting older. Forsooth! You don't even know

721
01:46:40,949 --> 01:46:45,510
what that means dude. I went to the dentist today. No but it sounds all classically literate. I went

722
01:46:45,510 --> 01:46:53,060
to the dentist today. Teeth are fucking clean. They're beautiful. They're perfect. I have two

723
01:46:53,060 --> 01:46:58,340
cavities I have to get a root canal and I have to change out one of my teeth. One of them is

724
01:46:58,340 --> 01:47:13,699
completely broken and rotten in the back. So I mean. Hmm it's order a pair and a disturbing

725
01:47:13,699 --> 01:47:21,930
little monkey. Oh my teeth are fine. You're a monkey? Essentially. I guess this is where you

726
01:47:21,930 --> 01:47:28,390
stick your admission form. We need an admission form so can I take an admission form? Symptoms form.

727
01:47:34,340 --> 01:47:39,779
It didn't like it. I bet we have to get that officially filled out. Trust me. Okay so we're

728
01:47:39,779 --> 01:47:49,529
going to bring this form back to uh Sybil. Home for former gerber rumble stars. All right we got

729
01:47:49,529 --> 01:47:55,640
the form. Let's bring it back to Sybil. Just click on everything. We got the form. Let's go ahead and

730
01:47:56,520 --> 01:48:06,970
add inflection at the end of every sentence. Back to the office. Let's get in the car.

731
01:48:07,770 --> 01:48:24,039
That'll bring us to where we are now. Sybil's office. Is it time for a pee break? Not yet.

732
01:48:24,680 --> 01:48:35,460
It will be very soon though. I've got news for you. Somebody said shut the fuck up. You're gonna be

733
01:48:35,460 --> 01:48:49,420
in big trouble if you keep that up. Big trouble. Big trouble. Do you think I might have artificial

734
01:48:49,420 --> 01:48:56,939
personality disorder? Hmm interesting. Symptoms include uh let's see obsession with money,

735
01:48:56,939 --> 01:49:03,180
violent reactions to dentistry, and an unconscious desire to see one's peers getting older. Hey I know

736
01:49:03,180 --> 01:49:10,859
I could psychoanalyze you. You already did. No I already did this. This took like 25 minutes.

737
01:49:10,859 --> 01:49:19,140
Actually let's save the psycho now. Hmm. Oh god damn it. Symptoms include uh obsession with

738
01:49:19,140 --> 01:49:24,260
money, violent reactions to dentistry, and an unconscious desire to see one's. Okay so we have

739
01:49:24,260 --> 01:49:33,770
to take. Hey doc. Hey. How do you like to shrink my head a little? Of course. What? Okay ink blocks.

740
01:49:33,770 --> 01:49:38,970
Can we do some more? Sure. Take a look. Okay so what was the first thing? It was reactions to

741
01:49:38,970 --> 01:49:47,689
money. Pennies on the eyes of a dead mime. Pennies on the eyes of a dead mime. Interesting. The next

742
01:49:47,689 --> 01:49:56,090
thing was. How about this one? The peers getting older. No it was the second one. Uh it was money,

743
01:49:56,090 --> 01:50:02,010
obsession with money, and then the second one was what? Dentistry. A bunch of bacteria.

744
01:50:02,890 --> 01:50:15,850
SUV crashing into a mansion. Pigeons. Bacteria. An SUV crashing into an opulent.

745
01:50:16,949 --> 01:50:26,729
And this? Squirreling around an uncle moth eating. Oh they're all money related okay. My uncle Louie's

746
01:50:26,729 --> 01:50:35,449
moth eating wallet. Now this one. What do you see? It's like I do money for all these. New York stock

747
01:50:35,449 --> 01:50:44,359
exchange. Yeah elephants at the New York stock exchange. And this one. So we're just gaming the

748
01:50:44,359 --> 01:50:57,000
system here right now to get what we want. Debit card. A debit card fed through a document shredder.

749
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:01,960
Hmm well judging by your responses you seem to be fairly obsessed with that's a symptom of

750
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:07,319
artificial personality disorder. I'd better mark it on your chart. Germa's obsessed with money.

751
01:51:08,359 --> 01:51:14,359
He's obsessed with it. Very interesting. We should test you for the other symptoms of APD.

752
01:51:14,439 --> 01:51:20,439
Whatever you say, sawbones. I'm not a sawbones. I'm a psychotherapist. Isn't it weird when you say

753
01:51:20,439 --> 01:51:25,640
the word money? Hey I'm getting hungry. I don't know why but sometimes I don't know what it is.

754
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:31,880
Money. Like what happens on your face when you do it? Say money. Like your your nose scrunches

755
01:51:32,439 --> 01:51:39,000
and you're like up your upper lip goes up like money. Money. It's a weird fucking word.

756
01:51:41,159 --> 01:52:19,770
Money. I'll show you. Ready? Watch my face. Um dog. Cat. Hammer. Money. Ball. Dream. Car.

757
01:52:21,539 --> 01:52:48,979
Money. Money. Money. It's weird. I don't know why I do that. Closet. Money. Race track. Baby.

758
01:52:50,180 --> 01:53:13,399
Money. All right let's keep going. Let's try some more free association. That will tell us more

759
01:53:13,399 --> 01:53:19,159
about your unreasonable reactions to the elements of your life. Remember I'll say words and you just

760
01:53:19,159 --> 01:53:27,770
do or say whatever comes naturally. Ready? Sure go ahead. Cow. So uh this is uh what's this one?

761
01:53:28,489 --> 01:53:39,369
This is not the one growing older. Dentist. Lamp black. Sample size. Travesty. Is it what what does

762
01:53:39,369 --> 01:53:57,880
this have to do with the dentist? Cow. Violent reaction to the dentist. Sample size. Mm-hmm. How

763
01:53:57,880 --> 01:54:03,340
about this word? Drill. Here we go. What do you think of this free association? No no no no Max.

764
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:10,140
Seems like a crack. Hmm dialogue. No no no no no no. Hey I'm not imaginary. If you say so. Dryer.

765
01:54:10,140 --> 01:54:22,020
Just do whatever comes naturally. Shit. Can we stop now? I was not trying to click on Max.

766
01:54:22,020 --> 01:54:29,239
Am I saying the jerk? Do you think I might? Maybe. Let's try some more free association. That will

767
01:54:29,239 --> 01:54:34,199
tell us more about your unreasonable reactions to the elements of your life. A punch. Remember I'll

768
01:54:34,199 --> 01:54:38,600
say words and you just do or say whatever comes naturally. Great job. You just scared the money

769
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:47,189
out of my wallet. Have a good night. Lug nut. Thank you for the thank you so much for the money.

770
01:54:47,909 --> 01:54:51,210
Major clusterfuckers. That's actually this fucking lot of money. Seriously thank you.

771
01:54:54,970 --> 01:55:00,569
Calorie consciousness. Really? Have a good night as well. Major clusterfuck. Fluoride. Just do or say

772
01:55:00,569 --> 01:55:18,810
whatever comes naturally. Fluoride. Travesty. Fluoride. Travesty. I thought you might say

773
01:55:18,810 --> 01:55:29,029
something like that. Teasing. Teasing. Aquamarine. Interesting. Well this has been. Am I? Do you think

774
01:55:29,029 --> 01:55:36,329
I might? Maybe. No. Let's try. That will tell us. Remember I'll say. Ready? Ready. Interesting

775
01:55:36,329 --> 01:55:55,619
choice of word. Let's go. Okay. Let's try. Promenade. I see. Polish. Polish. Whoa don't shoot. Violent

776
01:55:55,619 --> 01:56:02,260
reaction. Violent reaction. You should see him at Thanksgiving. Violent reaction to the word.

777
01:56:02,819 --> 01:56:15,770
Interesting. Polish. Just do or say whatever comes naturally. Sample size. What an unusual.

778
01:56:16,729 --> 01:56:22,489
This has been illuminating. All right. Yes. Your responses lead me to believe that you have

779
01:56:22,489 --> 01:56:29,210
podiatrists. It could be symptomatic of artificial personality disorder. I'd better mark this on your

780
01:56:29,210 --> 01:56:37,529
chart. What is it? Sample size. You have two of the symptoms listed on this form. Am I deranged?

781
01:56:37,609 --> 01:56:43,529
I don't want to alarm you but probably. Can I have your hat when they commit you? Sure little buddy.

782
01:56:45,880 --> 01:56:50,359
I'd like to tell you about another mundane but strangely compelling dream I have. So this is now.

783
01:56:50,359 --> 01:56:58,619
Right. Let's examine your disturbing subconscious desires a bit further. Okay tell me what happened.

784
01:57:00,300 --> 01:57:09,899
You're scared of other people getting older. I realized there was someone else in the room with

785
01:57:09,899 --> 01:57:24,220
me. Oh who was your special guest? So it's not me. Who would it be? Other people. It would be Max

786
01:57:24,220 --> 01:57:32,619
right? It was Max. Ah yes your imaginary friend. Not you getting older. Excuse me I'm standing

787
01:57:32,619 --> 01:57:39,340
right next to you lady. In your dream was Max doing anything unusual? Well he was seeing the pledge

788
01:57:39,340 --> 01:57:46,220
of allegiance to the tune of Camptown Races. I pledge allegiance to my gun dooda dooda. But that's

789
01:57:46,220 --> 01:57:58,180
not unusual. Okay what was Max doing? What was Max doing? I had just gotten something new from

790
01:57:58,180 --> 01:58:08,979
the bakery. For a celebration perhaps? What did you get? A birthday cake because they're getting older.

791
01:58:08,979 --> 01:58:15,300
It was an overly frosted birthday cake. Wait a second. The birthday cake? Your friend? You

792
01:58:15,300 --> 01:58:21,859
subconsciously want to see your peers get older. I could have told you that. This is a definite

793
01:58:21,859 --> 01:58:28,500
symptom of artificial personality disorder. Yes I mean I hope it's not serious. I'd better mark

794
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:36,460
this on your chart. Mock it on your chart. Wow it must be artificial personality disorder.

795
01:58:36,460 --> 01:58:41,500
You've got all the signs. I bet I can get a paper out of this. Better ship me off to some sort of

796
01:58:41,500 --> 01:58:46,699
home for former child stars then. I've signed this admissions form but you'll have to arrange

797
01:58:46,699 --> 01:58:52,859
your own transportation. I'm about to be really busy publishing the details of your case. Since

798
01:58:52,859 --> 01:58:59,819
you're crazy can I drive? Jumping vehicular homicide? No. I've been doing that more frequently.

799
01:59:03,430 --> 01:59:11,979
God that's the wrong door. It's just so close. All right so I got it symptoms form. Let's go turn it in.

800
01:59:31,770 --> 01:59:39,899
Where we going Sam? Back to Brady Culture's home for former child stars. Oh okay.

801
01:59:40,619 --> 02:00:18,890
Put it in. You've been accepted. Come on little buddy there's justice to be served. Can we get ice cream afterwards?

802
02:00:18,890 --> 02:00:28,739
Justice makes me hungry. This reminds me of that place where Aunt Trudy lives with the medicine smell

803
02:00:28,739 --> 02:00:34,020
and the rubber sheets and the enormous mute Indian. Sounds like a million laughs. Yeah mostly after

804
02:00:34,020 --> 02:00:35,939
medication time. Where is everyone?

805
02:00:38,869 --> 02:00:47,369
There he is. Uh-oh. Polk Rutoot above doubts. This is Culture's clubhouse.

806
02:00:47,369 --> 02:00:55,989
Jumping lawn cheney and a bottle fright wig. Brady Culture I presume. You know who I am.

807
02:00:55,989 --> 02:01:01,510
Evil plans really do work. Don't get too excited stretch pants. The freelance police are here.

808
02:01:02,149 --> 02:01:10,789
Yes actually. I've been waiting for you. Really? Next time try leaving the front door open.

809
02:01:10,789 --> 02:01:14,869
Save us all some grief. Allow me to explain.

810
02:01:17,029 --> 02:01:22,310
Uh-oh I think we just triggered a soliloquy. Good thing I have the attention span of a pinty yak butter.

811
02:01:22,310 --> 02:01:30,069
I never wanted much. Just to be universally loved that's all and to be number one in the tv ratings

812
02:01:30,069 --> 02:01:36,149
for the 1971 fall season. It's doing a lot of really good piano playing. Those worthless hacks.

813
02:01:36,149 --> 02:01:42,470
The pseudopuppies with their matching shirts and their cute little jingles. They came on opposite

814
02:01:42,470 --> 02:01:49,670
me and stole my audience. I was never offered another role and now YouTube vigilantes won't

815
02:01:49,670 --> 02:01:55,829
even let a poor down on his luck actor mass hypnotize the entire viewing public to become

816
02:01:55,829 --> 02:02:00,789
his worshipful fans forever. It's an organ just mashing on your face against it. It'll sound good.

817
02:02:01,670 --> 02:02:08,470
I think so. You know that's true. Since you've ruined the beautiful irony of having some of the

818
02:02:08,470 --> 02:02:16,310
best organ songs are just mashing. I'm afraid you'll just have to take their places. In your

819
02:02:16,310 --> 02:02:28,470
dreams culture. No my friends in yours. Hey that tickles. Become video delivery man.

820
02:02:37,899 --> 02:02:47,819
What what's happening? Oh no oh no what what are you doing? I don't know. I you were in on it all

821
02:02:47,819 --> 02:02:53,979
along. I told you it was a conspiracy. I told you but then you already knew didn't you? You're awake.

822
02:02:53,979 --> 02:03:02,939
No Bosco. I must deliver videos. Call the CIA. Call Interpol. Call Mickey Rooney. Must deliver

823
02:03:02,939 --> 02:03:22,619
Mickey Rooney videos. So we have to deliver the videos? Where's Max? I must deliver videos. Hey

824
02:03:22,619 --> 02:03:33,850
my beloved weapons are gone. I must deliver videos. Give me the cheese. Too far. Too far.

825
02:03:35,050 --> 02:03:46,520
Uh I tried to get the cheese. All right give me the cheese. Oh don't even try it. I love that part.

826
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:52,010
Now somebody come in and tell me that everything's. Hey tell me. Talk to me. Do the spell. The reverse

827
02:03:52,010 --> 02:04:02,869
spell. Uh oh either I just walked into the Salvador Dali Memorial Wax Museum or I'm dreaming.

828
02:04:03,829 --> 02:04:13,539
You love me. You adore me. Become video delivery man. Do my evil bidding and so forth.

829
02:04:16,020 --> 02:04:21,060
Holy brains in a blender. I'm still hypnotized. If only I could remember what Sybil told me to do.

830
02:04:22,260 --> 02:04:30,979
Destroy the intruder in your dream. Oh yeah. Hey Sam I'm up here. Oh hi little buddy. Do I

831
02:04:30,979 --> 02:04:34,979
gotta put everybody back together again? You stole my body. I hate when people do that. You gotta

832
02:04:34,979 --> 02:04:43,960
get me down from here. Okay little guy I'll save you. All right so first things first. Let's take

833
02:04:43,960 --> 02:04:52,619
your head off. Max's body. Oh and it feels good too. I just love my new furry paws and cute little

834
02:04:52,619 --> 02:04:59,619
tail. Hey don't touch my tail you psychopathic body stealer. Oh just let me at him. All right

835
02:04:59,619 --> 02:05:13,020
do I have any items? Like a gun? It's Brady culture on TV. Yes right where I belong. Everyone

836
02:05:13,020 --> 02:05:32,949
watch me. Me! Shooting TV stars only makes them stronger. Is that? I don't know but I don't know

837
02:05:33,029 --> 02:05:50,340
if I believe that. Didn't hurt. I don't want to pop him. Smoke. All right I didn't even know this

838
02:05:50,340 --> 02:06:00,300
is over here. Hold on. It's just a dream Sam. Bicycle pump and the rat. Weird what is this thing?

839
02:06:00,300 --> 02:06:07,699
Is it bicycle pump it? Now we got a giant rat. Sweet rodent eating disorders. That is one fat rat.

840
02:06:09,590 --> 02:06:21,800
Oh interesting. What about the closet? He's in the closet too with the cheese. I will be number one

841
02:06:21,800 --> 02:06:27,640
in the ratings. Now hey Brady cheese. What is it fool? I'd like to introduce you to a little

842
02:06:27,640 --> 02:06:32,859
friend of mine. Make him big so he gets in there and eats him. Only has like a couple seconds to

843
02:06:32,859 --> 02:06:44,699
do it though. No the cheese must stand alone. And another one bites the cheese. All right so what

844
02:06:44,779 --> 02:06:55,369
did that do? Is it empty? All right the smoke probably does something.

845
02:06:59,590 --> 02:07:11,859
I will be universally strange. What does he say about it? Don't worry little buddy I'll get you.

846
02:07:11,859 --> 02:07:19,699
Hurry Sam I've got an itch I can't scratch. Guns not gonna do anything. What about the window?

847
02:07:21,140 --> 02:07:39,659
TV can't shoot the TV. Bicycle pump. Brady culture has a knife. Enigmatic. What's he pointing at?

848
02:07:40,539 --> 02:08:15,260
Why is he pointing at me? You just following me around? He's not doing it now. Dance puppet dance.

849
02:08:17,399 --> 02:08:20,279
I think someone needs to turn the lights out on your career Brady.

850
02:08:22,680 --> 02:08:33,180
That Brady culture he turns the world off with his smile. Coat rack is a pencil. Interesting.

851
02:08:33,180 --> 02:08:40,100
Can I pick it up? It's just a dream Sam. I cannot pick it up. So what how do I get your head?

852
02:08:42,470 --> 02:08:53,939
Off of that body. What is this doing here? Hey it's loose. Down? Whoa okay. That was the most fun

853
02:08:53,939 --> 02:08:59,539
I've had since I lost my body. I gotta get his head. I gotta get his head off. I gotta move him over

854
02:08:59,539 --> 02:09:04,659
here or get his head off. That was great but Sam if you'll know. Okay hold on. All right how do I

855
02:09:04,659 --> 02:09:16,039
can I push you over? Brady's stolen Max's. Just let me at him. How do I get how do I move you this

856
02:09:16,039 --> 02:09:30,869
way? I may not show it much but I love you Sam. Now go wash my car. Uh should I break this open?

857
02:09:30,869 --> 02:09:49,500
Weird. I may not. Can I turn it the other way? Does it have to go down? Can I move it to the

858
02:09:49,500 --> 02:10:15,899
other side so it goes left or right? Okay hold on. Whoa gotcha. All right I thought I could.

859
02:10:16,859 --> 02:10:24,149
How do I get your head off? Can I just tear it off with my bare hands?

860
02:10:24,949 --> 02:10:30,550
I don't think Max would like me sticking his head there. No no not like not like shove your head

861
02:10:30,550 --> 02:10:38,470
down his pants. I'm talking like here. Oh Mr. Culture I have a surprise for you. Really? For me?

862
02:10:43,619 --> 02:10:56,380
Oh my. Thanks Sam. A little stringy but good. Oh I just remembered I'm supposed to be somewhere.

863
02:10:56,380 --> 02:11:06,380
Bye Max. I did it. Do I need to release them? I may not show it much but I

864
02:11:07,180 --> 02:11:17,060
washed my car. How do I get the tv off? I can't shoot the tv now. Can I shoot the tv now that his

865
02:11:17,060 --> 02:11:36,489
his brain is gone? I think I've done. This smoke is the only thing that's interactable I think

866
02:11:36,489 --> 02:11:47,060
still. What the hand? I want strange. Is there a plug? I wonder what would happen to the picture

867
02:11:47,140 --> 02:11:52,340
quality if I gave this a tug. This is essentially pulling the plug. I must be on tv for all eternity.

868
02:11:56,119 --> 02:12:06,550
Oh yes that's much better reception. You got it. Oh no he's awake. What done for? Save the girlish

869
02:12:06,550 --> 02:12:12,470
histrionics Bosco. I'm all right. I was merely the victim of your garden variety video delivery.

870
02:12:12,470 --> 02:12:18,390
TV finally has a use. But what about your co-conspirator? My co-conspirator? Holy underpants

871
02:12:18,470 --> 02:12:22,949
draped to the mast of a sinking pork rind freighter. That hirsuteeumaniac kidnapped

872
02:12:22,949 --> 02:12:31,420
my little buddy. Why is Sam Robin from the 60s Batman? Lightning Rider just gave five community

873
02:12:31,420 --> 02:12:44,300
subs. Thank you for the five subs. Coming in with five. Any community subs? Thank you.

874
02:12:44,939 --> 02:12:51,899
Brady Coulter? I bow man. Stay away from him. He's got it in for me. Sorry Bosco. No can do. I've got

875
02:12:51,899 --> 02:12:57,960
to save my free little pal. Can you help me? I don't suppose you have a Bosco tech device

876
02:12:57,960 --> 02:13:03,560
that stymies hypnosis inducing energy beams. A hypnosis blocker? I thought about making one of

877
02:13:03,560 --> 02:13:12,069
those but I would even know where to begin. I've got to find something quick. Bye Bosco. Do me proud.

878
02:13:12,949 --> 02:13:22,390
There's no time for that. No don't take the cheese. Can I just go walk back in the front door?

879
02:13:23,109 --> 02:13:38,359
Do I have a car? No my car is gone right? Technically. Yeah I guess I drove back.

880
02:13:40,819 --> 02:13:45,300
How did I drive the car back? I'm not going back to that asylum until I've got a working defense

881
02:13:45,300 --> 02:13:51,060
against that dastardly hypnotist. Okay what about over here? Maybe Sybil will give me something.

882
02:13:51,060 --> 02:14:03,140
Speaking of community subs. Ert thank you. Ert for the five community subs. Ert 110 thank you.

883
02:14:07,689 --> 02:14:16,090
Doc Max is gone. Well most of us outgrow our imaginary friends eventually. No that

884
02:14:16,090 --> 02:14:22,649
megalomaniac Brady cultures got him. I see of course. How do you get picked for a community sub?

885
02:14:23,529 --> 02:14:32,859
I think it's just random. It randomly just picks a non-sub in the chat and they get it. Hang on.

886
02:14:32,859 --> 02:14:38,859
Were you implying that Max is imaginary? I wasn't implying anything though he does seem a little

887
02:14:38,859 --> 02:14:46,810
improbable. But you have to do it singularly. But then I'm a psychotherapist. I forgot to find

888
02:14:46,810 --> 02:14:52,340
some way to block a hypnotic ray. I don't suppose you as a brain specialist of sorts would know

889
02:14:52,340 --> 02:14:57,939
anything. I've been monitoring people for months to choose who to pick. Great suffering. Oh really?

890
02:14:57,939 --> 02:15:03,380
You do know something. Oh there you go. Before my synapses fuse into a milky puddle of swine.

891
02:15:03,380 --> 02:15:09,140
Speaking of subs. Brody and thanks for the five community subs. Brody weapon. Thank you.

892
02:15:09,220 --> 02:15:14,500
But one of my more technologically inclined patients drew me a diagram of a contraption

893
02:15:14,500 --> 02:15:20,579
he claimed will block hypnosis. That's just the sort of ridiculously lucky break I need.

894
02:15:20,579 --> 02:15:26,500
It's a huge violation of every reasonable code of ethical conduct of course. But you being a

895
02:15:26,500 --> 02:15:32,579
policeman of sorts. I suppose it's okay to give you the diagram. My lack of solid engineering

896
02:15:32,579 --> 02:15:37,939
background has finally caught up with me. I can't make any sense of this. I'd love to help but

897
02:15:37,939 --> 02:15:45,020
engineering is one of the few fields I haven't tried. Sorry. Engineering. Okay.

898
02:15:46,060 --> 02:15:50,939
Hey pilot guy. Five more community subs from pilot guy. Five more community subs from

899
02:15:50,939 --> 02:16:00,949
German lied about Minecraft VR. Drossophilia five community subs. Now here comes the the rollout of

900
02:16:00,949 --> 02:16:12,500
gifted subs. Thank you guys. I'm gonna go give this to Bosco. It's not that way. Oh Jesus.

901
02:16:13,670 --> 02:16:20,229
Five. I can't. They're coming out too fast. Gnarly thanks for the five community subs.

902
02:16:20,229 --> 02:16:41,479
Peek of banana five. Pixel Mike five. Drossophilia five. It's a lot. Thank you guys. What a generous

903
02:16:41,479 --> 02:16:59,590
bunch of people. Even more coming in. Flug boy. Gnarly. Did Gnarly give another five?

904
02:17:00,309 --> 02:17:11,959
Flug boy with five. Who now isn't a sub? Everybody's a sub at this point. Thank you guys.

905
02:17:13,129 --> 02:17:21,260
That won't help me. Can you make something out of this? Bosco take a gander at this. Thank you

906
02:17:21,260 --> 02:17:25,659
Kyratopia for the five even nice subs. It's instructions for the latest in Bosco tech

907
02:17:25,659 --> 02:17:32,940
innovation. Buy from Kyratopia. Yeah I can build this. Just need one thing. What's that? Something

908
02:17:32,940 --> 02:17:38,329
for that antenna thing at the top. Antenna. Got it. Didn't I just didn't already pick it up?

909
02:17:42,299 --> 02:18:02,649
Go get the antenna from the tv. Sorry I had to new. I sneezed. I had to sneeze.

910
02:18:03,530 --> 02:18:08,139
Shadows one. Disciple. Thank you for the five community subs.

911
02:18:12,010 --> 02:18:22,120
One Mystica. Thanks for the five community subs. Thank you guys. More subs rolling in.

912
02:18:22,120 --> 02:18:25,610
A fucking shitload. That's like 50. More.

913
02:18:26,409 --> 02:18:37,899
Max isn't gonna like it when he finds out I ruined our reception.

914
02:18:37,899 --> 02:18:54,809
I've got to tell him as soon as possible. Wholesome chat. Generous chat. I got a sub. I'm a lurker.

915
02:18:55,450 --> 02:19:17,579
I'm glad you got it. Let's go back. Give him the cone hanger so he can fix this. Finish it. Another

916
02:19:17,579 --> 02:19:26,309
five from Adventure MF Dan. Five community subs. Will a make-do antenna do as a make-do antenna?

917
02:19:26,309 --> 02:19:31,829
Yeah okay. Let me just add a little Bosco tech innovation. Thank you. Here it is. The most

918
02:19:31,829 --> 02:19:36,629
sophisticated hypnosis blocking helmet the world has ever seen. You guys are too much. Thank you

919
02:19:36,629 --> 02:19:41,350
guys. Happy days are here again. Uh oh seems like the old moolah gauge is running on empty.

920
02:19:41,350 --> 02:19:48,389
I take it. Just stop that bread culture. He's got it in for me. You're a credit to dementia Bosco.

921
02:19:48,389 --> 02:19:55,399
You'll have to pay for the next one though. To wear this thing. I'll put it on inside

922
02:19:56,040 --> 02:20:09,260
this neighborhood. Sounds good. What is it? Food review? What food should I review? I don't have

923
02:20:09,260 --> 02:20:19,020
any food to review. I've been a sub for five years and all I got was this lousy streamer.

924
02:20:20,889 --> 02:20:35,799
That's actually a pretty... That would be a funny shirt. It would be. Let's get in here. Put on the

925
02:20:35,799 --> 02:20:40,520
helmet. Rule number three. Always wear protective headgear when confronting diabolical villains

926
02:20:40,520 --> 02:20:50,090
with hypnotic devices. Still waiting for that clown car. When's he gonna get in the clown car?

927
02:20:50,090 --> 02:20:55,770
Hand over the lagomorph culture. Sam! Boy am I glad to see you. Johann Sebastian here only knows

928
02:20:55,770 --> 02:21:02,889
how to play one song. What's this? A rerun? Didn't we just see the dog getting hypnotized episode?

929
02:21:03,530 --> 02:21:05,610
Well if you really want to watch it again.

930
02:21:09,139 --> 02:21:13,379
What? Back into him. Another triumph for skanky ingenuity and ordinary kitchenware.

931
02:21:13,459 --> 02:21:20,340
Give it up culture. Your quiche is cooked. Time out for the cavalry. You colored outside the lines

932
02:21:20,340 --> 02:21:28,420
of the law Brady culture. We see you and this time we're going to get hypnotized again.

933
02:21:31,139 --> 02:21:37,940
Why didn't I have headgear for them? I should have made three of them. So now my foolish pawns. Attack

934
02:21:37,940 --> 02:21:51,530
the dog. That doesn't need it. Attack the dog.

935
02:21:56,600 --> 02:22:05,209
Attack the dog. Well there's videos over there. Television.

936
02:22:07,670 --> 02:22:14,200
They have no gun. Boxing glove. Can I like give them tape to fight over?

937
02:22:14,760 --> 02:22:19,079
It's a stack of those libo videos.

938
02:22:23,819 --> 02:22:37,020
Don't think that. Hey culture have you ever watched your own video tape? Of course not.

939
02:22:37,020 --> 02:22:54,059
I'm not an idiot. What? Why? Why did that happen? It's a stack of those libo videos.

940
02:22:57,500 --> 02:23:03,100
Attack the dog. Okay so then they attack. I pull up the glove. They stop. I don't know I want to

941
02:23:03,979 --> 02:23:23,370
open the inventory. Attack the videotapes.

942
02:23:37,899 --> 02:23:48,739
Attack the videotapes. That's a good idea. Attack Brady culture. No attack the dog. Hey what?

943
02:23:48,739 --> 02:24:09,930
What? Become what? Become me. Summer assaulting democrats in a crate of sauerkraut.

944
02:24:09,930 --> 02:24:16,170
Patience is a sharp razor to swallow. You crack me up little buddy. Who's that supposed to be?

945
02:24:17,290 --> 02:24:20,010
Attack the dog. Attack the dog.

946
02:24:20,010 --> 02:24:35,100
This is a good turn-based video game. All right so become yourselves right?

947
02:24:35,899 --> 02:24:54,549
Become Brady culture. Become become videotapes. Become videotapes. Black wits. Attack the dog.

948
02:24:55,270 --> 02:24:55,989
Ouch.

949
02:25:06,940 --> 02:25:16,790
Attack yourselves. Attack yourselves.

950
02:25:24,629 --> 02:25:35,750
Attack Brady culture. No attack. Ouch. You okay little buddy? How are you doing up there?

951
02:25:35,829 --> 02:25:40,389
Adversary with gory high school poems while he plays that dumb song over and over.

952
02:25:40,389 --> 02:25:48,260
Hey that's my theme song. Well I mean there's the videotapes.

953
02:25:51,139 --> 02:26:10,340
Become yourselves. Become yourselves. Attack the dog. Attack me.

954
02:26:11,139 --> 02:26:19,020
Whoops. Ouch. Attack the dog.

955
02:26:27,370 --> 02:26:40,170
Become Brady culture. Do my evil bidding. Worship the videotape. Attack the dog. Attack the dog.

956
02:26:40,889 --> 02:26:47,190
Attack the dog. I can't move. Telev- can I attack the tv?

957
02:26:47,190 --> 02:26:51,750
Every bed's got its own tv. I feel like making a bad pun about Brady's order.

958
02:27:02,389 --> 02:27:13,319
Wait wait wait wait wait. Where did worship come from? Worship? Worship wasn't here before.

959
02:27:14,870 --> 02:27:29,719
Worship me. No. Worship me you minions. Mine. It's a step. Attack the dog.

960
02:27:30,520 --> 02:27:43,819
Ouch. Where was worship before? Worship me. No me me. Worship me. Everything is about me.

961
02:27:48,680 --> 02:28:06,870
Me me me. I don't think that would be interested enough. I don't think. Attack me. No me. Attack

962
02:28:06,870 --> 02:28:16,709
me. Me me me. Yes. No wait I mean. We had to actually do Daffy Duck. Remember I told

963
02:28:16,709 --> 02:28:20,309
you that before with the very beginning. We had to play like it was a cartoon. I tried to send

964
02:28:20,309 --> 02:28:24,950
you semaphore signals with my ears but you know how I always get the K and the V mixed up.

965
02:28:24,950 --> 02:28:31,139
You crack me up little buddy. Well I guess we should de-hypnotize these poor saps again and

966
02:28:31,219 --> 02:28:36,819
be on our way. Let me. You know how I adork gratuitous violence. Caffeine rock.

967
02:28:42,069 --> 02:28:47,510
Well that's that Max. You didn't break them the lenses just came out. You have to melt those

968
02:28:47,510 --> 02:28:52,149
lenses down. The blind control thing didn't go any further. That could have been really annoying.

969
02:28:53,129 --> 02:28:59,049
It's great to be on your show Myra. I'm a huge fan. I just can't seem to stop watching for some

970
02:28:59,049 --> 02:29:30,579
reason. Hey Salmon Max. Episode two or Dragon. What do you think? Episode two? What do you think?

971
02:29:46,299 --> 02:29:52,219
Personality test? Double do that? That'll be a whole screen.

972
02:29:52,379 --> 02:29:58,870
All right let's take a good pee break. We'll bring it back. We'll do episode two.

973
02:29:59,750 --> 02:30:04,680
They're all like two two and a half hours so that's a good time.

974
02:30:15,829 --> 02:30:24,739
Now we're gonna do season one episode two. That drunk guy at car tape not killing us.

975
02:30:25,780 --> 02:30:32,979
What? Who is that? Is that somebody in Mr. Credits? That was somebody's job description?

976
02:30:33,700 --> 02:30:56,709
Oh special thanks I see. Well that's episode one. I'm gonna save it. Oh well I already beat it so

977
02:30:56,709 --> 02:31:03,350
it don't matter. Episode two is its own separate game so we're gonna open it. I'll be right back.

978
02:31:04,069 --> 02:35:46,870
Gonna grab a water. Gonna pee. Be back in like two three minutes. See you real soon. Okay let's

979
02:35:46,870 --> 02:36:03,610
quit out of this and open up episode two. But I also want to make this clear. Make sure everyone

980
02:36:03,610 --> 02:36:16,329
knows it's existing. That after today you are not going to see me for a week. I'm out. I'm out of

981
02:36:16,329 --> 02:36:30,790
here. I will be back around this time next weekend. I'm going on a mom vacation. I will not be around.

982
02:36:30,790 --> 02:36:42,600
Just make sure everybody knows. Talked about it a bunch but want to make sure nobody misses it.

983
02:36:42,600 --> 02:36:50,940
It's gonna be the title of my stream for a week. Is it gonna be mom is here. See you next week.

984
02:36:50,940 --> 02:37:04,809
Jerma's average dong comes in with 10 community subs. Thank you for the 10 community subs.

985
02:37:04,809 --> 02:37:11,030
Jerma's average dong. I gotta mute this because it's probably gonna be pretty loud. What's episode

986
02:37:11,030 --> 02:37:25,340
two called? Situation comedy is episode two. Interesting. Are they all like two two and a half

987
02:37:25,340 --> 02:37:32,899
hours long or is it one of those scenarios where because it seems like each one is its own game.

988
02:37:32,899 --> 02:37:52,819
Okay five more community subs from Freudian Weapon. Thank you Freudian. Thank you all of you.

989
02:37:53,459 --> 02:38:10,340
Listen how loud this is. You can hear that shit but this is the gym playlist. I had to take them

990
02:38:10,340 --> 02:38:23,430
out. Headphones are out. More community subs from Jerma's average dong. Oh my god. Thank you. Ten

991
02:38:23,430 --> 02:38:31,030
more. Uh why is it just skipping right to this? No I gotta hold on. I gotta get to the menu.

992
02:38:36,299 --> 02:38:39,979
More community subs. Jerma lied about Minecraft VR. Five more community subs.

993
02:38:44,680 --> 02:38:54,340
You guys. Somebody get that phone. Oh wow a 15 sub dong. Okay here we go. I'm gonna have to restart

994
02:38:54,340 --> 02:39:08,819
it. The resolution's all wrong. It's all wrong. All right that's better. Uh gotta turn full screen

995
02:39:08,819 --> 02:39:17,659
off because I cannot capture it otherwise it'll lag. Apply the resolution and let's cap the

996
02:39:17,659 --> 02:39:34,459
screen. What do you say? Let's get this over with huh. There we are. Okay new game. Yes I do want to

997
02:39:34,459 --> 02:39:58,280
make a new game. All right let's do episode two. This is cool though. It's fun just to sit and play

998
02:39:58,280 --> 02:40:09,590
and hang out. I said this yesterday but it's kind of been a while since we've just relaxed and played

999
02:40:09,590 --> 02:40:16,940
a game together. Just watched and hung out. Talked about stuff. It's good to do it. We did it

1000
02:40:16,940 --> 02:40:24,520
yesterday. Ten more community subs from my average dong. Jerma's average dong. That that's

1001
02:40:25,959 --> 02:40:43,209
10, 20, 30 plus community subs. Thank you so much. I'm gonna duel to start this one. I remember

1002
02:40:43,209 --> 02:40:52,229
that gun. That thing was worth a lot of money too. Yes that's the what's it called? The Lugamore

1003
02:40:52,229 --> 02:40:57,030
print. Yep.

1004
02:41:15,270 --> 02:41:16,629
Oh isn't that a hypnosis thing?

1005
02:41:24,629 --> 02:41:29,750
Gifts against their collective will. I don't normally endorse the use of the word dastardly

1006
02:41:29,750 --> 02:41:34,709
but this is clearly dastardly. Pretty refined for a Lugamore. We've got to drive over to the station

1007
02:41:34,709 --> 02:41:39,350
right away. We're at our earliest convenience. Great I've been itching to bust some skulls since

1008
02:41:39,350 --> 02:41:49,879
they cancelled my so-called life. The voice actor changed? Why? The other voice actor did episode one

1009
02:41:50,600 --> 02:42:00,010
and that's it. More dong. Ten more dongs. Thank you so much for the ten community subs.

1010
02:42:02,489 --> 02:42:12,139
Not so average anymore. Not such an average dong. Local streamer gets rich off own genitals.

1011
02:42:12,860 --> 02:42:18,180
But yeah if you're taking off I know it's late. I started really late.

1012
02:42:23,700 --> 02:42:26,659
But we're gonna go for a little longer. We'll do episode two. We'll chill.

1013
02:42:27,620 --> 02:42:36,459
We'll probably go pretty late. So if it's uh I know I started at like seven o'clock

1014
02:42:36,459 --> 02:42:41,159
pacific but I did want to go live today because I knew I wasn't going to be live for a while. So

1015
02:42:41,159 --> 02:42:45,420
if you're going to take off see you soon. See you next week. The sauce will be set to the day

1016
02:42:46,469 --> 02:42:51,319
and me and my mother will have a good time. But for people that are sticking around

1017
02:42:51,319 --> 02:43:03,299
we'll go I'm assuming past midnight tonight pacific at least. Sam and Max 2. Here we go.

1018
02:43:03,299 --> 02:43:10,040
Myra stump holding her audience hostage. You watch that particular bit of daytime fluff occasionally

1019
02:43:10,040 --> 02:43:15,719
don't you Max? Whenever our tv's out of hot for some reason I can't get enough of her sharp tooth

1020
02:43:15,719 --> 02:43:23,979
maternal ranting. Holy shit. Jerma's average dong. Jerma average dong is trying to reach

1021
02:43:23,979 --> 02:43:34,739
Jerma's massive dong status. More community subs. You're a lovable but essentially useless lump of

1022
02:43:34,819 --> 02:43:40,340
Thank you for 10 more. Oh my god. On the contrary I can be a vital source of alternative insight

1023
02:43:40,340 --> 02:43:45,860
into the problems that plague you. Well there's that. I am the massive dong.

1024
02:43:47,780 --> 02:43:50,340
Oh god they're the same person.

1025
02:43:54,629 --> 02:44:00,100
This is all secret plot for me to talk about my dong. Why do you suppose Myra's got her

1026
02:44:00,100 --> 02:44:05,299
audience captive? Who knows? Last month Charles Groton put his hand on her desk and she hit it

1027
02:44:05,299 --> 02:44:14,950
with a ruler. She's very strict. It's incredibly generous though. It really is. Let's get going.

1028
02:44:14,950 --> 02:44:25,129
You lead and I'll follow hack hat. They're all the same person. It leads back to me now. Seriously

1029
02:44:25,129 --> 02:44:32,659
whoever you are thank you. It's a lot of money. All right so it's the same town same people same

1030
02:44:32,659 --> 02:44:41,690
things just new adversary. What is it? She's in the closet still? Nope. Oh it's the hair.

1031
02:44:41,690 --> 02:44:48,250
It makes for an unwieldy but oh so enchanting memento of our first case in a long while.

1032
02:44:48,889 --> 02:45:02,889
He howled like a sick wallaby when I shaved it off him. Quick times. It's the hair. More

1033
02:45:03,610 --> 02:45:13,139
more subs. The dong money laundering scheme continues. 10 more. 90 subs already.

1034
02:45:14,100 --> 02:45:31,750
What? Oh my god. Let's go. Let's take a let's take a walk over here. Newspaper. Newspaper.

1035
02:45:31,750 --> 02:45:37,350
Brady culture behind bars. He finally found a way to become famous. The police plotter.

1036
02:45:40,389 --> 02:45:49,340
Alien love triangle times. Looks like they're sold out. How do you report dick money to the IRS?

1037
02:45:50,139 --> 02:46:04,389
Takes me back to my childhood. Oh my god. Bringing Jerma up to a higher tax bracket.

1038
02:46:09,030 --> 02:46:14,149
And don't forget about Adventure Dan with five more community subs. Thank you. Not really.

1039
02:46:14,950 --> 02:46:24,629
It's me Bosco. What's with the planet ship strainer Bosco? Bosco? I know not that moniker.

1040
02:46:25,270 --> 02:46:33,430
I am Lord Reginald Rumplebottom. Earl of Dukedom. Sam what language is he speaking?

1041
02:46:33,430 --> 02:46:41,909
I'm not sure Max but I think it might be English. Local streamer writes off penis on tax form as a

1042
02:46:41,909 --> 02:46:56,549
dependent. Imagine trying to pulse him. I mean that what would you okay if you were at the IRS

1043
02:46:56,549 --> 02:47:08,469
and you saw that what'd you do? Would you laugh or would you be like annoyed? I'm not sure. No

1044
02:47:08,469 --> 02:47:13,270
really what made you convert to British? It's because everybody's got an end for me that's why.

1045
02:47:13,909 --> 02:47:19,590
Yeah we heard. I had to get a disguise to throw them off the trail. Oh they'll never find me now.

1046
02:47:20,149 --> 02:47:23,829
They wouldn't even know where to begin to look. Clever clogs.

1047
02:47:27,299 --> 02:47:30,979
All right so what what's the problem? The forces of evil are bedeviling you this time.

1048
02:47:30,979 --> 02:47:37,299
It's the skin bodies man they're after me. Skin bodies? Sounds like a pack of belligerent nudists.

1049
02:47:37,299 --> 02:47:43,379
Oh no the skin bodies are like skinheads but ten times worse. Sure they're not a hundred times worse?

1050
02:47:43,940 --> 02:47:54,149
Yeah maybe a hundred times maybe a million. Um these skin bodies what exactly are they doing to

1051
02:47:54,149 --> 02:48:02,950
you? They're stealing my I mean pinching my shaving cream. Of all the things of yours they could pinch

1052
02:48:02,950 --> 02:48:09,030
why the shaving cream? So they can shave their bodies of course. Of course they shave their

1053
02:48:09,030 --> 02:48:14,120
whole bodies. Yeah what happened to your security? Not to be rude but why? You're the best in the

1054
02:48:14,120 --> 02:48:19,079
world. Best security in the world. Stopping these skin bodies. Well after the whole video delivery

1055
02:48:19,079 --> 02:48:23,719
conspiracy I figured I better build something to keep people from bringing stuff into my store.

1056
02:48:24,600 --> 02:48:29,479
So? So I needed to borrow some of the high tech detecting parts from BTEC.

1057
02:48:30,440 --> 02:48:34,040
Meaning nothing's stopping people from taking stuff out of the store anymore.

1058
02:48:34,520 --> 02:48:43,510
Dash it all. I knew I forgot something. More dong subs. Where I think we're at over a hundred.

1059
02:48:44,229 --> 02:48:54,360
What did you say those skin bodies were doing? They're pinching my shaving cream. Thank you so

1060
02:48:54,360 --> 02:49:05,620
much Jerma's average dong. Hundred dongs. Too many dongs. Thanks Bosco.

1061
02:49:07,700 --> 02:49:11,559
Please don't ban me. I'm not gonna ban you.

1062
02:49:12,200 --> 02:49:27,139
Oh it's knackered. Ketchup, mustard, and purple stuff. As vaguely referred to on TV.

1063
02:49:28,180 --> 02:49:36,969
Too many dongs too little time. All right shaving cream. Is this it? Whipped liverwurst. Absolutely

1064
02:49:36,969 --> 02:49:49,270
not. Whipped liverwurst? That's fucking gross. So yeah I can take the shaving cream. I could use a

1065
02:49:49,270 --> 02:49:58,920
shave. I'll say your five o'clock shadow goes clear to your ankles. Pig, dog, pig dog. The

1066
02:49:58,920 --> 02:50:08,920
skin bodies rule the streets. Why are they shooting the gun in here? The little did it again after

1067
02:50:08,920 --> 02:50:19,000
him. I mean. They just. All right that was insane. Speaking of insane. We had 10 more coming right

1068
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:32,440
there. Holy shit. Let's do some shopping. Great. Did I put the volume too low? You crack me up

1069
02:50:32,440 --> 02:50:47,510
little buddy. I think that's all right. We gotta chase down those hairless rats. Oh wait what about

1070
02:50:47,510 --> 02:51:01,020
buying things? It's for your vacation. Oh I appreciate that. Hey Bosco. This was in the rat movie. We've got skin

1071
02:51:01,020 --> 02:51:07,899
bodies to chase Sam. Wait wait what? No. Hey Bosco. The law enforcement here in the states

1072
02:51:07,899 --> 02:51:27,690
really is pathetic. We've got. I can't. I have to go. Is that them? All right well their car probably

1073
02:51:27,690 --> 02:51:36,389
is very very slow. I get in my car. What can I just grab them when they drive by? Where are we going

1074
02:51:36,469 --> 02:51:51,190
Sam? Extra dongs. 10 more dongs. After those rats. It's not an average dong anymore. It's it's too

1075
02:51:51,190 --> 02:51:58,420
it's too big. No I just said that. No but listen. It's a lot of money. I just hope that you're

1076
02:51:58,420 --> 02:52:04,420
financially able to. How do those rapidly small wheels move so fast? That's too many dongs.

1077
02:52:04,739 --> 02:52:37,020
The skin buddy. Try to drive him into something.

1078
02:52:49,260 --> 02:53:01,770
That was a bad grandpa Simpson but it's very loud. Okay hold on tight little buddy.

1079
02:53:07,100 --> 02:53:13,079
That's a good that was a pretty good take on that one. All right so what the hell why

1080
02:53:13,079 --> 02:53:32,309
what's what's the deal with that? Can I now go back in here? They rule these streets.

1081
02:53:34,379 --> 02:53:37,579
Took care of your rat problem now sir. Sell me some cheese.

1082
02:53:41,479 --> 02:53:52,579
We want to buy something. Yes quite so quite so. What have you got? Well just between us I have a

1083
02:53:52,579 --> 02:53:59,540
most peculiar device. Is this going to be another tear gas? What peculiar device are you so eager to

1084
02:53:59,540 --> 02:54:05,940
pawn off on us this time? It's the latest in Bosco tech innovation. A delightful invention I like to

1085
02:54:05,940 --> 02:54:12,420
call a chemical based voice modulator. Voice modulator? What's that? I do believe it's

1086
02:54:12,420 --> 02:54:18,020
self-explanatory. We don't really have time to explain it to ourselves. Why don't you just

1087
02:54:18,020 --> 02:54:25,139
explain it to us? Well it alters the frequency of your voice molecules. Very useful very useful.

1088
02:54:26,100 --> 02:54:31,690
Can we just have it or is it 10 grand? We'd like that. Is everything 10 grand in this game?

1089
02:54:31,690 --> 02:54:37,370
That will be 30 shillings. Yeah I left our shillings in my other pants. How much in dollars?

1090
02:54:38,010 --> 02:54:46,809
Let's see here 30 shillings would be about one million American dollars. A million dollars? No

1091
02:54:46,809 --> 02:54:51,770
way are we giving out that many tickets. I think we'll have to find an entirely new revenue stream

1092
02:54:51,770 --> 02:55:00,010
if we want that voice modulator. Worth every shilling trust me trust me. Okay so no let's

1093
02:55:00,010 --> 02:55:05,049
do that again. We'd like that. That will be. We'll be back later once we find out. Now we need to

1094
02:55:05,049 --> 02:55:14,700
become millionaires. Nothing for us. What does this do? Hands in the air Bosco. You're coming with

1095
02:55:14,700 --> 02:55:21,340
us. Good heavens. We're taking you in for masquerading as a man of class and distinction.

1096
02:55:21,340 --> 02:55:28,379
What the devil? Surely you jest. Yes surely we do. On the bright side now you can add the police to

1097
02:55:28,379 --> 02:55:36,040
your long list of paranoia induced nightmare subjects. Piss off. See you later Bosco. Thanks

1098
02:55:36,040 --> 02:55:51,510
Bosco. Hello sir. There's another option? We want to buy something. Oh is it different this time?

1099
02:55:52,309 --> 02:55:59,719
Do you have any complimentary fresh garlic? No. Do you have any fine leather jackets?

1100
02:56:00,360 --> 02:56:09,559
No. It's different every time. Do you have any gumballs the size of your head? No. Do you have

1101
02:56:09,559 --> 02:56:18,680
any plus two plate armor of limitless squeeze ability? No. Do you have any pes dispensers with

1102
02:56:18,680 --> 02:56:29,000
the head of infamous Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa? No. Do you have any ketchup? No. Oh wait.

1103
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:40,040
Got you. Blast. Drank. Dash it all. Can I have it? Nothing for us right. Let's go back the other way.

1104
02:56:40,040 --> 02:56:58,389
How's the uh the psychoanalyst doing? Thanks Bosco. Bombs? Rope? Lamboil? It's all yours friend

1105
02:56:58,389 --> 02:57:21,510
as long as you have enough rupees. That's an old one. Isn't it beautiful? Garden. Those are old.

1106
02:57:22,149 --> 02:57:34,200
That's seriously one of my first experiences with memology. You know what I mean? Sam, Max,

1107
02:57:34,200 --> 02:57:39,399
how nice to see you. I don't suppose you have any candid photos of little green men feeling

1108
02:57:39,399 --> 02:57:48,729
frisky do you? What? What? It's my new career. I'm a tabloid publisher specializing in the thoughtful

1109
02:57:48,729 --> 02:57:53,930
analysis of groundbreaking news of interest to myself and others like me. What's it called?

1110
02:57:53,930 --> 02:58:02,010
She's going to change careers every episode. So you're a publisher now? What happened to

1111
02:58:02,010 --> 02:58:06,809
psychotherapy? I've always had a fascination with the suppressed and the sensual and for telling

1112
02:58:06,809 --> 02:58:12,090
people too much about both. Publishing the alien love triangle times is a logical extension of

1113
02:58:12,090 --> 02:58:21,209
all my previous careers except maybe Vatican spokesperson. You don't do psychotherapy anymore.

1114
02:58:21,209 --> 02:58:27,129
Are you doing any psychotherapy on the side? Only on space aliens. I guess that narrows your clientele

1115
02:58:27,129 --> 02:58:35,399
quite a bit. No not really. What was it you said about a photo? My new tabloid the alien love

1116
02:58:35,399 --> 02:58:40,920
triangle times needs a cover photo of an extraterrestrial biological entity or alien

1117
02:58:40,920 --> 02:58:45,399
as the unwashed masses calls them caught getting cozy with some of the locals.

1118
02:58:46,360 --> 02:58:50,600
Sybil I'd like the record to show that although I support you as a friend your latest project

1119
02:58:50,600 --> 02:59:00,420
makes my skin decidedly crawly. Me too. I like that tie. I like that tie. I want this tie as a shirt.

1120
02:59:03,399 --> 02:59:14,469
I'd wear it. Psychoanalyze me again. Quick analysis for old times sake. Oh all right think of a number

1121
02:59:14,469 --> 02:59:22,379
between one and four. Two. Two. You're selectively audio-averse. I don't like the sound of that.

1122
02:59:27,379 --> 02:59:30,579
All right what about what do you need? So you're looking for a cover photo of little green men

1123
02:59:30,579 --> 02:59:36,420
canoodling right? Yeah though I'm kind of desperate at this point. Basically I can use anything as

1124
02:59:36,420 --> 02:59:41,219
long as there are three beings in the shot and at least one of them's an alien. It is the alien

1125
02:59:41,219 --> 02:59:44,739
love triangle times after all. So I need three people in a picture and one's gonna be an alien.

1126
02:59:46,780 --> 02:59:53,100
There's nothing like good hard-nosed journalism. You said it it's time to find out the real answers

1127
02:59:53,100 --> 03:00:00,700
to the real questions. Like what did those poor cattle do to deserve that? No what do aliens do

1128
03:00:00,700 --> 03:00:08,059
for romance? Do they love? How do they get their otherworldly thrills? By playing slots in Keno?

1129
03:00:08,059 --> 03:00:16,819
That'd explain why they're always seen in Nevada. No you got me woke up. He said fuck Keno. Keno

1130
03:00:16,819 --> 03:00:23,989
sucks. Have you learned anything interesting since you started this uh magazine? I learned why Elvis

1131
03:00:23,989 --> 03:00:31,270
had such an otherworldly voice. Elvis was not an alien. Sure he was. He just wore makeup to cover

1132
03:00:31,750 --> 03:00:36,870
his emerald green skin. Frankly Sybil, this project is disturbing as well as distressingly

1133
03:00:36,870 --> 03:00:42,549
intimate. Like seeing Stephen King getting a hot butter massage. Is that the first thing you've

1134
03:00:42,549 --> 03:01:00,020
written on stream? Who else is an alien? Is anybody else an alien that we might not know about? Dr.

1135
03:01:00,020 --> 03:01:10,149
Phil. Well that goes without saying. I can see that. That makes sense. Dr. Phil really does come

1136
03:01:10,229 --> 03:01:15,350
off as the kind of guy that after the show. And that's the whole thing. See you next time

1137
03:01:15,350 --> 03:01:19,829
when we analyze someone else. Get out of here. Get out of here. You're a you're a dumb idiot.

1138
03:01:19,829 --> 03:01:26,950
Get out of here. And he goes backstage and like his skin just fucking falls off of him. He like

1139
03:01:26,950 --> 03:01:42,739
gets in a bath. An alien bath. I can see it. In fact if I had to name you like 10 people that I

1140
03:01:42,739 --> 03:01:54,760
think might be an alien. Dr. Phil would be in number eight. I think. This is they knew what

1141
03:01:54,760 --> 03:02:01,940
they were doing. What's in an alien bath? It's a regular bath except there's an alien in it this

1142
03:02:01,940 --> 03:02:13,850
time. And they add like other like spices in it and shit. We'll be back. Keep watching the supplies.

1143
03:02:18,340 --> 03:02:27,049
There's like the coriander and like cumin and fucking like cilantro. Now let's look at some of

1144
03:02:27,049 --> 03:02:32,170
this stuff. She's got a story here about two hygienists from Walla Walla and an amorphous

1145
03:02:32,170 --> 03:02:36,649
saturnian slime mold. There's like oregano in it. Is that the one where they walk into a bar? Tabasco

1146
03:02:36,649 --> 03:02:41,290
sauce and shit. They put like all kinds of weird stuff in it. That's not even weird. That stuff's

1147
03:02:41,290 --> 03:02:50,090
like good. What am I talking about? A mima graph. I love cilantro. Yeah I do. It's so good.

1148
03:02:51,290 --> 03:03:01,959
Okay so we need a picture. What's my mayonnaise? Nothing useful in here.

1149
03:03:04,979 --> 03:03:08,899
This is not the exit. God damn it. I do it every time.

1150
03:03:12,020 --> 03:03:18,659
Nice cactus. Saguaro. Vinyl. Hey if you dip that in ink you could do 30 tattoos at once.

1151
03:03:20,899 --> 03:03:28,569
Cilantro just tastes like I'm eating grass and chemicals. Yeah only us aliens know what it tastes.

1152
03:03:28,569 --> 03:03:46,309
You have to be an alien to like cilantro. It's kind of weird because cilantro,

1153
03:03:46,950 --> 03:03:52,389
the way cilantro smells, I don't want it near me. It's kind of like the way that I think a mosquito

1154
03:03:52,389 --> 03:03:59,819
feels when you have off on your body. If cilantro comes near me I'm like no get that away. I don't

1155
03:03:59,819 --> 03:04:12,200
want it. I don't want to near me but I like it. I like the way it tastes. No there's actually new

1156
03:04:12,200 --> 03:04:17,159
gumballs in here. Looks like candy but I'm pretty sure it's fish tank gravel again. I've had worse.

1157
03:04:17,159 --> 03:04:23,479
Yeah cilantro smells like a mosquito feels when they're approaching somebody with off on their

1158
03:04:23,479 --> 03:04:29,209
body. You know you can just sense something that something's wrong and you just don't want to be

1159
03:04:29,209 --> 03:04:37,620
near it. There is people repellent. Off. OFF. Off. You don't know what off is. Off. The spray. The

1160
03:04:37,620 --> 03:04:47,659
mosquito spray. You put it all over your body. Off. OFF. It's the number one name brand mosquito

1161
03:04:47,659 --> 03:04:58,469
repellent in the world probably. You don't use raid on your body. You use off. Off and cilantro

1162
03:04:58,469 --> 03:05:10,649
smell the same. Are you trying to tell us you don't like this? No don't use raid. Raid. Money.

1163
03:05:11,290 --> 03:05:18,389
All right what am I doing? I need a picture. Can I go anywhere to get this? Okay picture. I need a

1164
03:05:18,389 --> 03:05:31,450
photo. A photo of aliens. There was another place over here that I didn't get to see before. Zoomers

1165
03:05:31,450 --> 03:05:47,159
don't use bug spray. What do you mean? What do you do? What do you do instead of bug spray?

1166
03:05:49,829 --> 03:06:02,600
Light a couple of candles? Where are we going Sam? The tv studio. Goodie. You guys do cilantro

1167
03:06:02,600 --> 03:06:08,040
candles? No what's it called? What's this? It's got a certain name. Cilantro candles. They're all the

1168
03:06:08,040 --> 03:06:13,879
same thing. They smell the same. Um citronello. Cilantro. Citrus cilantro. Well here we are Max.

1169
03:06:13,879 --> 03:06:19,799
The tv station with programs too old to be contemporary, too new to be retro, but consistently

1170
03:06:19,799 --> 03:06:25,879
derivative enough to be popular. W-A-R-P. Television's so mindless you can't help but

1171
03:06:25,879 --> 03:06:32,040
watch. I thought citronello was citrus. No it's cilantro. Mysteriously so. Well let's find this

1172
03:06:32,040 --> 03:06:37,959
Myra character and smack some good old-fashioned. Cilantro salmonella. Smack it into her or smack it

1173
03:06:37,959 --> 03:06:42,360
out of her just so long as there's smacking involved. You crack me up little buddy.

1174
03:06:44,250 --> 03:06:49,299
Citrine candles burn into plasma. Don't do that. Be careful.

1175
03:06:50,020 --> 03:07:05,159
Need a broom little buddy? I don't use brooms Sam. I necessitate the use of them. Director's chair.

1176
03:07:05,159 --> 03:07:10,920
Let me sit in that see how it feels. It's got a falling star. Twinkle twinkle little star.

1177
03:07:10,920 --> 03:07:19,700
Feels pretty good. Howl crashing burn. Uh yeah. No no don't make don't make me do it. Don't make me do it.

1178
03:07:21,719 --> 03:07:36,180
No. All right I died. I got it. I'm fine. Stand aside casually a tired stagehand.

1179
03:07:36,180 --> 03:07:41,940
We're Sam and Max. Freelance police. Fight it. Fight it. We've come to save sympathetic hostages from the

1180
03:07:41,940 --> 03:07:46,819
clutches of. Okay I'm gonna stop you right there. Number one I'm not a stagehand. I am the director.

1181
03:07:46,819 --> 03:07:52,500
The director. Number two we're no longer holding the auditions for animal cops with crippling

1182
03:07:52,500 --> 03:07:57,299
mental disabilities and a lust for dance. The director. We're not actors. You got that right.

1183
03:07:57,299 --> 03:08:01,700
I don't think I've ever seen worse acting in my entire life and yes I have seen Keanu Reeves

1184
03:08:01,700 --> 03:08:08,020
performance in Toast the musical. Sam I think my hypersensitive ego may need stroking. Don't look

1185
03:08:08,020 --> 03:08:17,989
at me. Next? Who's next? Uh we're the police. You don't seem to understand. We're highly untrained

1186
03:08:17,989 --> 03:08:23,670
police officers. Look hats off for dedication guys but I'm just not buying the police act.

1187
03:08:23,670 --> 03:08:32,440
I feel so invalidated. Where is it? We're looking for Myra Stump. Myra Stump. Do not mention that

1188
03:08:32,440 --> 03:08:40,040
name in my presence. Which name Myra or Stump? Either and or both. What's your beef with Myra?

1189
03:08:40,040 --> 03:08:44,920
Let's just say Myra and I have creative differences. I'm creative and she isn't.

1190
03:08:45,479 --> 03:08:56,379
I'm sorry what was your question? Um why don't you like you Myra? Why the hate? Look Myra runs her show

1191
03:08:56,379 --> 03:09:01,739
her way and I run every other show my way. If she doesn't want me on her set I could care less.

1192
03:09:01,739 --> 03:09:07,500
You mean you couldn't care less. If you could care less then you do care some which doesn't really.

1193
03:09:07,500 --> 03:09:12,459
No I was right. I could care less because I care even less about what you're saying right now.

1194
03:09:12,459 --> 03:09:22,409
Oh go ahead knucklehead. Knucklehead? What are you doing here anyhow? What am I doing here? I'm

1195
03:09:22,409 --> 03:09:28,090
holding auditions for Midtown Cowboys. What are you doing here? Midtown Cowboys? The critically

1196
03:09:28,090 --> 03:09:33,049
panned but publicly adored sitcom about two cattle ranchers trying to make it in Midtown Manhattan?

1197
03:09:33,049 --> 03:09:40,170
Yes well summarized. You're hiring extras? No I'm hiring the stars. The two main characters went on

1198
03:09:40,170 --> 03:09:44,409
Myra a couple days ago and I haven't heard from them since. I need replacements ASAP.

1199
03:09:45,290 --> 03:09:51,770
Right here. If we could pass one lousy audition sitcom stardom will finally be ours. Rocketing

1200
03:09:51,770 --> 03:09:56,250
to fame for the most insubstantial of reasons. That truly is the American dream.

1201
03:09:57,850 --> 03:10:01,450
Would you like to audition please? Would you like to apply for that instant stardom you promised?

1202
03:10:02,010 --> 03:10:07,690
You want to audition? Well if there were anybody else here I'd tell you to forget it but okay.

1203
03:10:08,409 --> 03:10:13,290
All right what do we do? I'm going to have you play a scene from old Geller.

1204
03:10:13,290 --> 03:10:18,889
Tell me you've seen it. I'm not into horror movies. It's a classic boy gets a dog. I forgot

1205
03:10:18,889 --> 03:10:23,370
to tell you guys this. Boy shoots dog. All right all right all right. I want you to play the boy.

1206
03:10:23,370 --> 03:10:31,700
Yes boy that is so me. And Sam you play the dog. Oh okay Sam. This is a dentist story. I need you

1207
03:10:31,700 --> 03:10:37,780
to act like you've got full-blown rabies understand. What's my motivation? You're a bad

1208
03:10:37,780 --> 03:10:48,100
dog. Now show me rabbit. Um no dig deep. You should be just frothing mad.

1209
03:10:59,139 --> 03:11:05,620
Sorry I'm not hiring a dog who can't even do a simple rapidity scene. I don't know. I was feeling

1210
03:11:05,620 --> 03:11:09,940
rabid. You look pretty disease ridden to me. Come back after you've taken a few thousand acting.

1211
03:11:09,940 --> 03:11:13,940
I was acting rabid. All right well listen hold on this is important anyways.

1212
03:11:14,819 --> 03:11:22,260
So uh I'm at the dentist today right. Sit down. We're going over some stuff. I do some x-rays and

1213
03:11:22,260 --> 03:11:28,340
I'm lying blind back and they have a a tv on the wall. Some dentists do this now. They have

1214
03:11:28,340 --> 03:11:34,340
you know like monitors all in each room. So I'm sitting there and there's Netflix on it.

1215
03:11:35,940 --> 03:11:40,260
And oh okay cool. This is very this is actually a pretty cool idea. You just have can have like tv

1216
03:11:40,260 --> 03:11:47,059
there. Like that's fucking ridiculous. That's really really awesome. So the dentist is just

1217
03:11:47,059 --> 03:11:49,620
like hey man like yeah while you waiting while you're chilling around while you while we're

1218
03:11:49,620 --> 03:11:52,579
doing some stuff you know you can uh just just browse and put on whatever you want.

1219
03:11:53,299 --> 03:12:00,840
I'm like okay cool. And you know how you can see like what people have seen already on Netflix

1220
03:12:01,479 --> 03:12:08,569
and the queue of stuff that has already been watched. One of the last things that was on

1221
03:12:09,750 --> 03:12:16,389
was a bunch of horror movies like Friday the 13th like Freddy. Why the fuck would you ever watch

1222
03:12:16,950 --> 03:12:20,549
Friday the 13th when you were getting dental work? That's that's terrifying.

1223
03:12:22,459 --> 03:12:27,180
It was like at least two or three fucking messed up horror movies. I'm just sitting there going

1224
03:12:28,139 --> 03:12:33,819
imagine lying there and watching like Jason tear somebody in half with like a chainsaw while

1225
03:12:33,819 --> 03:12:47,430
there's a guy in your mouth like with dentist tools. And I don't know if anybody else is like

1226
03:12:47,430 --> 03:12:53,049
this but I have this weird thing where I don't want anyone to know the things that I want to

1227
03:12:53,049 --> 03:13:01,420
watch on tv. Is that weird? I hovered over a show about wine and I didn't want to put it on

1228
03:13:03,100 --> 03:13:08,809
because it was like a wine documentary and I just felt like people are gonna judge my taste or

1229
03:13:08,809 --> 03:13:14,010
something. I'm trying to think of what's the most normal background thing I could possibly put on.

1230
03:13:15,020 --> 03:13:22,379
I'm scrolling through you've got home fiction and then sell it but I'm like that's too normal.

1231
03:13:22,379 --> 03:13:27,110
That's like too weird. Why would I watch that show? I'm like oh how about like a food show?

1232
03:13:27,110 --> 03:13:31,350
Ah those are those are really easy. Just put on like a food documentary about like sushi

1233
03:13:32,569 --> 03:13:38,090
but I why would I watch that while I'm getting my like teeth like looked at? No. I could it was

1234
03:13:38,090 --> 03:13:41,690
freaking me out. I'm just sitting in the chair. I don't know what to put on and then I scrolled

1235
03:13:41,690 --> 03:13:44,889
over like animation. Like what's like is the animated show? No like what if I put on like a

1236
03:13:44,889 --> 03:13:47,770
kid show? I don't want to put on like a kid show. Why are you watching like a kid show?

1237
03:13:48,489 --> 03:13:54,700
Why are you what are you weird? No no I just I don't know what to put on. Maybe that is why

1238
03:13:54,700 --> 03:14:05,530
people put on horror movies. Seriously I was I it was it was crazy but yeah the last thing

1239
03:14:05,530 --> 03:14:14,680
that somebody watched they were trying to get on friday the 13th how it's made but and what okay

1240
03:14:14,680 --> 03:14:19,719
what and then I was thinking how funny it would be if I did if I put on like a dentist documentary

1241
03:14:21,819 --> 03:14:26,299
I'm trying to think of what that'd be funny these are the dentist is like oh yeah go and put on

1242
03:14:26,299 --> 03:14:30,780
whatever you want and I put on like a dentist thing like a dentist show would that be weird

1243
03:14:30,780 --> 03:14:42,139
would they think it was fucking crazy like oh like tooth exam but go to like the app and just type

1244
03:14:42,139 --> 03:14:51,979
in like tooth examinations to see if there's like a tooth exam mini series what's it what is a

1245
03:14:51,979 --> 03:14:59,860
fucking dentist show there is no dentist show I'm just that's a whole nother question first of all

1246
03:14:59,860 --> 03:15:06,420
there's a ton of doctor shows house uh nip tuck you got er where are the dentist shows

1247
03:15:10,579 --> 03:15:22,420
why is there no big dentist drama there should be

1248
03:15:25,319 --> 03:15:38,940
Sweeney Todd was a dentist no he was a shaver hello again yes can we take another crack at

1264
03:17:56,200 --> 03:18:00,920
I was convinced you were actually shooting him how did you do the sound effects

1265
03:18:00,920 --> 03:18:09,639

let's hurry sam we only have 14 minutes and 55 seconds of fame left scaffold scaffold hey even

1267
03:18:19,340 --> 03:18:24,299
the scaffold is just a prop scaffold from that show about the tv crew that solves crimes around

1268
03:18:24,299 --> 03:18:28,700
the scaffold is here advanced forensics and overly dramatic reenactments come on

1269
03:18:28,700 --> 03:18:39,299
whoever heard of a crime at a tv station i'm getting pretty good at it the barrel haven

1270
03:18:39,860 --> 03:18:44,579
from whence comes this story from whence from whence clearly from a work of unparalleled

1271
03:18:44,579 --> 03:18:59,239
artistic vision and emotional expressiveness no wonder I haven't seen it once used for apples

1272
03:18:59,319 --> 03:19:08,840
now used for derrières sitcom from midtown cowboys midtown cowboys that away

1273
03:19:09,479 --> 03:19:15,860
all right people let's get the stage set up celebrity hosts will be here any minute

1274

1276
03:19:40,409 --> 03:19:45,129
laws of physics sorry you'd be amazed how many times a day I have to do that things tend to be

1277
03:19:45,129 --> 03:19:51,290
hectic here doesn't bother us a bit sam and max consummate professional actors reporting for duty

1278
03:19:52,489 --> 03:19:58,569
you said duty sam I knew you guys were right for this show speaking of which could you perhaps

1279
03:19:58,569 --> 03:20:03,530
explain the show a bit okay here's the drill on midtown cowboy you play a pair of cattle ranchers

1280
03:20:03,530 --> 03:20:09,610
trying to raise a herd in an apartment in manhattan my uncle Ernie did that except it was pigs and not

1281
03:20:09,610 --> 03:20:16,329
in an apartment I only see one cow it's a small herd you're struggling okay okay all right you've

1282
03:20:16,329 --> 03:20:22,329
got this landlord mr federally who has a very strict no cows policy devilishly inconvenient

1283
03:20:22,329 --> 03:20:27,850
I begin to see from whence the hilarity sprouts yes federally is always barging in and you try

1284
03:20:27,850 --> 03:20:31,530
to hide the fact that you have a cow in the apartment lots of side gags usually something

1285
03:20:31,530 --> 03:20:37,690
gross winds up happening simple enough great where's the script well there's a slight hitch

1286
03:20:37,690 --> 03:20:41,290
the cow ate most of the script so you're going to have to ad-lib the show perfect

1287
03:20:41,290 --> 03:20:46,569
ad-lib go to doing that yes make it up as you go improvise I can do that yes our regular life

1288
03:20:46,569 --> 03:20:51,209
has given us plenty of practice don't worry you'll be working with philo pennyworth who plays

1289
03:20:51,209 --> 03:20:55,850
federally he's a brilliant actor classically trained globe theater and all that just set

1290
03:20:55,850 --> 03:21:01,930
him up to do something funny and he'll handle it from there check anything else actually yes

1291
03:21:01,930 --> 03:21:06,010
we did save one line from the script and it's really important to work it in because it's the

1292
03:21:06,010 --> 03:21:10,010
product placement that pays for the whole show one of you will have to save the line

1293
03:21:10,649 --> 03:21:16,889
me me pick me all right max your line is this better get the serious toothpaste oh you're

1294

1295
03:21:26,440 --> 03:21:31,799
learn with this tv business give me the lowdown on midtown cowboys is about two cattle ranchers

1296
03:21:31,799 --> 03:21:36,520
raising a herd in a manhattan apartment that has a strict no cows policy no cows your basic visual

1297
03:21:36,520 --> 03:21:41,159
hijinks and occasional grows out humor and sue as they concoct elaborate ruses to keep their cow

1300
03:21:56,020 --> 03:22:00,500

this stuff isn't just for school lunches real kitchens use it too and uh tweed of course it

1689
04:27:28,170 --> 04:27:34,329
wouldn't be real bachelor cooking without queen bachelors here's a tip tweed isn't just for

1690
04:27:34,329 --> 04:27:40,969
cooking it also makes a great toupee and msg every chef has a signature ingredient that no one has

1691
04:27:40,969 --> 04:27:47,690
ever heard of or used mine's msg if you put in enough that you feel a burning sensation in the

1692
04:27:47,690 --> 04:27:54,649
back of the neck forearms and chest you're just about there make sure to include red dye number

1693
04:27:54,649 --> 04:28:01,290
two if there's not at least some possibility of malignant tumors it's not get it in there do

1694

we broil it sam right you are and through the magic of one gorgeous oh boy let's take it put

1695
04:28:09,260 --> 04:28:23,739
ketchup on it come back and let's go is it msg not even that bad for you um i don't know isn't that

1696
04:28:23,739 --> 04:28:34,969
one of those things i think we talked about this before msg can like didn't msg cause headaches in

1697
04:28:34,969 --> 04:28:58,620
one person msg makes you retain crazy water yeah what that the thing about msg wasn't there wasn't

1698
04:28:58,620 --> 04:29:04,299
there one guy scenario where somebody said msg gave me a headache and maybe sick and stuff and

1699
04:29:04,299 --> 04:29:25,860
they did like a whole thing on it hello i mean the moral of the story is don't use too much salt

1700
04:29:25,860 --> 04:29:40,170
or any additive on anything a little ketchup is always good on a cake don't put too much salt

1701
04:29:40,170 --> 04:29:51,290
too much sugar bring your body down towards more natural approach moral of the moral of the story

1702
04:29:51,290 --> 04:29:56,409
just lower your intake of salt sodium don't eat too much cheese you can eat it eat a bunch

1703
04:29:56,409 --> 04:30:02,899
of it eat a fucking ton of it don't eat too much of it make sure you're thoroughly cooking your

1742
04:35:48,139 --> 04:35:53,259
what about while you're on my show you stay in your seats at all times you do not interrupt me

1743
04:35:53,259 --> 04:35:58,060
when i'm talking and you treat the audience with the utmost respect even if you become less sure

1744
04:35:58,060 --> 04:36:04,860
with each passing year that they deserve it now i'll call you on stage in a minute gosh max

1745
04:36:04,860 --> 04:36:10,060
celebrity is just a never-ending set of arbitrary goals one accomplishes to appease a dismissive and

1746
04:36:10,060 --> 04:36:15,979
distracted if not entirely absent authority figure i don't know if i agree sam but i've begun my

1747
04:36:15,979 --> 04:36:28,840
decadent slide into a depraved personal hell just in case okay give her a hand everyone

1748
04:36:28,840 --> 04:36:34,759
bessie bovine reading from her new book the heart has four stomachs ruminations on a life in hollywood

1749
04:36:34,759 --> 04:36:41,799

1750
04:36:41,799 --> 04:36:47,000
mean we're ready to pack it in we've got the stars of the not quite canceled sitcom

1751
04:36:47,000 --> 04:36:52,840
midtown cowboys who also happen to be the winner and judge of tv's embarrassing idol

1752
04:36:52,840 --> 04:37:05,099
ladies and gentlemen sam and math hold the hayride little pal that bear seems more than

1753
04:37:05,099 --> 04:37:11,099
slightly hinky in the mesmeric sense of the term shadier than a fat man's ankles let's take it down

1754
04:37:11,099 --> 04:37:21,580
like ducks in a gutter my guess it at that end but that bear has got you set we'll just sit where

1755
04:37:21,580 --> 04:37:28,380
you want us to man lovely what gives sam why can't we just grab the bear it would appear that the

1759
04:37:43,500 --> 04:37:51,419
alien love triangle times uh i'd rather talk about midtown cowboys i'd rather leave my embarrassing

1760
04:37:52,220 --> 04:37:56,540
about that picture in the times okay there is something you should know about that picture in

1761
04:37:56,540 --> 04:38:01,500
the times i'm not sure i want to know anything more maybe you just asked me about things it's

1762
04:38:01,500 --> 04:38:06,380
funny to flaunt your poly planetary pickups but the rest of us find alien love triangles frankly

1763
04:38:06,459 --> 04:38:20,869
disgusting but the photo is not quite what it seems how so it's not us we just used it to get

on here that's no alien it's hue bliss there was someone else involved it's not a picture

1891
04:58:23,319 --> 04:58:27,880
reason to believe that the toy mafia's secret headquarters are located in the one place no one

05:01:19,930 --> 05:01:24,729
about these teddy bears he shouldn't have we've got to find him and get to the bottom of this

coffee cup i'm out of coffee but i'm so nervous i keep trying to drink it anyway it's funny how

2221
05:48:55,619 --> 05:49:01,700
stress can reduce you to just a bundle of mindless reflexes is that what happened to me wouldn't it

2222
05:49:01,700 --> 05:49:09,860
be wonderful to think so how's it working how's that new profession working out oh sam the life

2223
05:49:09,860 --> 05:49:15,060
of a professional witness isn't all courtroom theatrics and finger pointing the toy mafia

2224
05:49:15,060 --> 05:49:20,580
told me if i testified against them they'd rub me out they tried to buy you off with a swedish

2225
05:49:20,580 --> 05:49:40,779
massage no max i think they meant murder all right time's up it's been 45 minutes it's been 45

2226
05:49:40,779 --> 05:50:02,389
minutes we got our task we got a thing that we're gonna do yeah it's it's getting late daylight

2227
05:50:02,389 --> 05:50:06,630
savings here an hour slow make it an even six hours well it's going to be because we're gonna

2228
05:50:06,630 --> 05:50:14,060

2229
05:50:14,060 --> 05:50:27,880
the bits we're gonna hang out so the stream is not over let me save the game yeah this is probably

2230
05:50:27,880 --> 05:50:37,049
a good stopping point we got through the casino we stopped here we got the task uh we'll be back

2231
05:50:37,049 --> 05:50:42,490
we'll be back i know you will you're out oops really she should consider guilt slinger as her

2232
05:50:42,490 --> 05:50:55,299
next profession so sam and max on the stream when i come back from my vacation we'll probably

2233
05:50:57,319 --> 05:51:02,360
we'll pick this back up this might not be the first thing coming back because there's a couple

2234
05:51:02,360 --> 05:51:09,400
things that are really that i would like to do but we're going to finish season one i promise

2235
05:51:09,400 --> 05:51:15,419
guaranteed like we're gonna i want to see how this goes through it might be the first thing

2236
05:51:15,419 --> 05:51:26,740
that happens when we come back it might be a day later we'll see season two is where it gets

2237
05:51:26,740 --> 05:51:35,220

2238
05:51:35,220 --> 05:51:43,459
more of these just chill streams when we play a game we dial it up to like a thousand sometimes

2239
05:51:43,459 --> 05:51:54,060
on this stream so it's nice to pull it back a little but uh that is going to be the end of this

2240
05:51:54,060 --> 05:52:06,919
portion i'm going to save it before it gets to be too late we got monster rancher four is another

2241
05:52:06,919 --> 05:52:16,520
one that i have to continue and these are all episodic so it's better this is saved right yeah

2372
06:25:13,720 --> 06:25:20,490
of vegeta and it really opened my eyes it made me realize how much i want to be a voice actress

2373
06:25:21,209 --> 06:25:28,729
i was debating it in my head uh you know like uh how i do do i really want this and doubting myself

06:25:28,729 --> 06:25:32,490
about it and i want to give up on the dream but after meeting all these cool people maybe really

2377
06:25:57,880 --> 06:26:07,750
they're great to have but they're even better to try and do as long as you're going with the

2378
06:26:07,750 --> 06:26:15,540
mindset that nothing is certain and always have a backup always have another plan you can make

2379

your dream into something else always be realistic set goals for yourself and go for it i'm glad you

06:28:10,069 --> 06:28:22,520
anybody play it these days pogchamp yeah i think it's great i'm absolutely going to finish at least

2389
06:28:22,520 --> 06:28:34,299
season one i like the cartoon i like anything too you know so it's cool i knew i was going to

2390
06:28:34,299 --> 06:28:40,900
like it i just didn't have a spot to start it you know what i mean it's it's it's hard to

2391
06:28:41,619 --> 06:28:47,540
let's put it this way all right guys vr we're gonna do some crazy shit in vr are you ready oh

2392
06:28:47,540 --> 06:28:52,580
my god look at all this fucking crazy stuff in vr sakiro oh it's fucking so hard now i'm gonna

2393
06:28:52,580 --> 06:28:59,340
play sam and max it's just hard to place it because it's slowing it down it's a lot more

2394
06:29:00,299 --> 06:29:07,459
it's an experience that you let happen on in front of you it's not some you know crazy

2395
06:29:07,459 --> 06:29:12,419
ridiculous thing that i'm going to stream so it's hard to find a place to put it sometimes

2396
06:29:13,459 --> 06:29:21,849
but like i said i want to start to pull in more of these just hanging out and doing something

2397
06:29:21,849 --> 06:29:28,869
streams but it was always hard to place because it always like was either right before or right

2398
06:29:28,950 --> 06:29:39,380
after something that was like really high energy did he play episode three i left because he said

2399
06:29:39,380 --> 06:29:49,849
he wouldn't well i played like 40 minutes of episode three but it looks like people that

2400
06:29:49,849 --> 06:29:56,020
you know took this kind of stream well right because i'm always curious of what people think

2401
06:29:56,020 --> 06:30:00,500
or who how many people are going to watch what are they going to say is move on this is boring

2402
06:30:00,500 --> 06:30:10,619
right but i think it was it was great i thought it was great so you'll definitely see it again

2403
06:30:13,299 --> 06:30:17,939
uh thank you to the true michi for the three dollars jeremy just want to remind you you did

2404
06:30:17,939 --> 06:30:25,349
forget me again as i predicted you wanted to hit me up on discord mr forgetful i know i'm so

2405
06:30:25,349 --> 06:30:31,020
fucking bad i really am there's like a handful of people that i'm like supposed to contact on

2406
06:30:31,020 --> 06:30:39,500
discord and it's just like my mind is just wipes every time i really have like a fucking boomer

2407
06:30:39,500 --> 06:30:55,560
memory it's ridiculous even important shit even like in my own family and friends but i'm sorry

2408
06:30:55,560 --> 06:31:12,470
about that okay yeah stream legends i will don't worry before the stream ends is ace attorney still

2409
06:31:12,470 --> 06:31:18,500
on the to-do list or has been shelved it has been shelved temporarily until i find out if it's

2410
06:31:18,500 --> 06:31:27,340
something i want to stream i'm gonna have some time here over this mom vacation where me and

2411
06:31:27,340 --> 06:31:32,220
my mother gonna do a bunch of stuff but i'll have some free time i'm probably gonna play

2412
06:31:32,220 --> 06:31:35,500
a little bit of the first case and then determine if it's something i want to stream

2413
06:31:36,299 --> 06:31:46,099
because i when i went into that house i said i wanted to do it it was not the game that i

2414
06:31:46,099 --> 06:31:50,419
thought it was going to be it's a lot more elaborate it's like an investigative game where

2415
06:31:50,419 --> 06:31:55,860
you do like detective work i thought it was just kind of like a courtroom argument simulator but

2416
06:31:55,860 --> 06:32:01,849
that's not what it is it's like a 40 hour long game and i just want to make sure that i don't

2417
06:32:02,490 --> 06:32:06,729
what i don't want to do and i want to stop doing this and i've been i've been all right with it

2418
06:32:06,729 --> 06:32:14,169
recently is starting something that a lot of people want to see and then realize kind of

2419
06:32:14,169 --> 06:32:18,090
20 percent of the way through it that i really don't think i want to do it anymore and then

2420
06:32:18,090 --> 06:32:24,169
don't do it so i really want to start to pick and choose if you're gonna see a game that's on the

2421
06:32:24,169 --> 06:32:46,950
stream we're gonna try to complete it so i want to try to do that more we'll see but thank you

06:34:24,889 --> 06:34:28,330
i told you about the lie detector shit how people did not think that was cool

2436
06:34:29,939 --> 06:34:35,060

2437
06:34:35,060 --> 06:34:41,270
about how it was absolute hell to everybody hated us when we tried to get the lie detector thing

2438
06:34:41,270 --> 06:34:49,830
going there's a whole stream about how we were like avoided people thought we were like dicks

2439
06:34:49,830 --> 06:34:59,270

2530
06:48:49,849 --> 06:48:54,810
you could collab you seem like the kind of person who likes to help people that's awesome that

2531
06:48:54,810 --> 06:48:59,849
they're doing that um but i've said the same thing about collaborations i've said in the past

2532
06:49:00,889 --> 06:49:06,810
i they just kind of happen i usually just do my own thing on this platform and on any platform

2533
06:49:08,259 --> 06:49:12,259
collaborations are they just sort of organically will happen with people that i

2534
06:49:12,259 --> 06:49:16,020
just you know randomly talk to or come across or hey is a project that i'd like to do

2535
06:49:17,430 --> 06:49:26,569
i don't really plan out my collaborations but that's pretty awesome that they're doing that

2536
06:49:34,119 --> 06:49:42,759
a lone rat is what he is rat solo for the most part yeah and we've gone over whole

2537
06:49:42,840 --> 06:49:46,360
20 30 minute segments of streams where i've talked about why

2538
06:49:47,240 --> 06:49:54,889
though not to be like a broken record or anything but yeah good for them though that's fucking great

2539

coolest sniper thanks for the 250 enjoy your vacation i will i definitely will tyler mike

2543
06:50:26,340 --> 06:50:30,419
thanks for the 250 that's what i love about you and vinnie you don't treat us like a business

2544
06:50:30,419 --> 06:50:39,110
opportunity you treat us like family just hanging out playing video games yeah and i mean and look

2545
06:50:39,110 --> 06:50:49,990
when i when i started doing this on youtube and twitch i don't want to i don't care about

2546
06:50:49,990 --> 06:50:55,909
fucking like making a bunch of money that i'm already making a bunch of money you know

2547
06:50:55,909 --> 06:51:03,700
what i mean like i don't care that's not and it doesn't do it for me like i don't like it

2548
06:51:04,790 --> 06:51:11,110
i would rather have people enjoy the streams and want to be part of the community than

2549
06:51:12,069 --> 06:51:18,470
turn everybody into these money churning numbers that i present to fucking companies and present

2550
06:51:18,470 --> 06:51:24,310
to people to make as much money as i possibly can i don't care about that i never have and i

2551
06:51:24,310 --> 06:51:31,849
never will i just it's not i'm just the person that i am i'm not going to say that streaming

2552
06:51:31,849 --> 06:51:35,529
and turning your stream into a business and treating like a business and trying to make a

2553
06:51:35,529 --> 06:51:45,139
bunch of money on your business is is wrong or bad i just did something i don't do because when

2554
06:51:45,139 --> 06:51:55,220
when i used to watch stuff i didn't want to be treated as a viewer as a number that was just

2555
06:51:55,299 --> 06:52:00,819
kind of a way to make somebody money you know i wanted to be like ah this is a place i like to

2556
06:52:01,459 --> 06:52:07,189
watch and hang out and i don't even want you guys to feel like you're being used to make me more

2557
06:52:07,189 --> 06:52:16,759
money and it's not like and i know a lot of people have said that that wouldn't be the case but i

2558
06:52:16,759 --> 06:52:30,069
don't even know where the hell i would start with that br josh yeah he's talked about parasocial

2559
06:52:30,069 --> 06:52:33,669
before it's hard to be sociable with your viewers without some of them thinking that you are their

2560
06:52:33,669 --> 06:52:37,189
friend even though there's no way for a big streamer to really be a friend with all their viewers

2561
06:52:38,150 --> 06:52:42,389
yeah the the way that i've answered that question and talked about that is kind of like what you're

2562
06:52:42,389 --> 06:52:53,509
saying is instead of it being you and i are here and we're friends it's all of us are here it's

2563
06:52:53,509 --> 06:53:01,509
not a you and i scenario it's a collective community of people that all are here and we're

2564
06:53:01,590 --> 06:53:16,759
all around for the same things we are many you are vessel but that's kind of true though you know

2565
06:53:16,759 --> 06:53:22,169
that's kind of the way it is that's the way it kind of should be we are all collectively here

2566
06:53:23,669 --> 06:53:30,150
we are venom we are venom i'm pretty good at that too i've been pretty good at making

2567
06:53:30,150 --> 06:53:35,099
impressions today don't view yourself as a vessel no i mean i know that's a joke but

2568
06:53:37,770 --> 06:53:46,330
i'd rather us collectively enjoy things than have it be a personal one-on-one you and i

2569
06:53:46,330 --> 06:54:04,919
relationship i think it's healthier that way but to put a cap on that conversation no i i treat this

2570
06:54:04,919 --> 06:54:10,599
the same way i treated this when i started making youtube videos let's start with the a b and c a

2571
06:54:10,599 --> 06:54:20,020
do i want to do this today no then i'm not gonna do it i'll see you tomorrow do i want to do this

2572
06:54:20,020 --> 06:54:23,860
today am i like do i have something planned do i have something i want to do do i have something

2573
06:54:23,860 --> 06:54:34,229
fun to try or something yes oh yeah let's go b no no no no i'm not saying like that's the like

2574
06:54:34,229 --> 06:54:44,500
no i'm saying like on a day-to-day basis week-to-week basis it's not like do i do i want to do this no

2575
06:54:44,500 --> 06:54:54,889
not like the whole thing as a whole now you're stuck in abc no it's like do i want to do this

2576
06:54:54,889 --> 06:55:00,459
will i have fun and am i currently having fun while i'm doing it you know i answer that question

2577
06:55:01,270 --> 06:55:09,159
each stream i sit here before stream starts a day the day before day two days before what do i want

2578
06:55:09,159 --> 06:55:14,439
to do what could be fun let's try that do i want to do that yeah all right let's go let's do it

2579
06:55:23,639 --> 06:55:31,020
you sit here for two i sit in the chair for two days i don't move and i just end up falling

2580
06:55:31,020 --> 06:55:34,540
asleep my chin hits my chest and i fucking fall asleep and i wake up screaming

2581
06:55:36,540 --> 06:55:45,900
okay what are we doing yeah sometimes it's like a detriment right like for instance like i built a

2582
06:55:45,900 --> 06:55:49,740
bird house on this stream i just somebody was like wouldn't that be fun it's i don't i'm gonna

2583
06:55:49,740 --> 06:55:54,860
fucking do it i'm gonna do that i don't give a shit well that's what we're doing even if it might

2584
06:55:54,860 --> 06:56:03,979
not be like the best idea if i'd some build a labo while drunk it's just i'm gonna do it nothing else

2585
06:56:03,979 --> 06:56:12,520
is in that equation besides does that sound like fun to me do the ideas land completely every time

2586
06:56:12,520 --> 06:56:25,220
no that doesn't mean i'm gonna stop doing them absolutely not i've been watching the archive my

2587
06:56:25,220 --> 06:56:36,810
first live stream was they was the game referred house stream vr josh thanks a lot man like that

2588
06:56:37,610 --> 06:56:50,950
imagine that's your first drink yeah but that's i will i wanted to be fun because i want to have

2589
06:56:50,950 --> 06:56:58,470
fun too you know it's really it's a symbiotic relationship as a collective unit of people

2590
06:56:59,479 --> 06:57:04,009
because i want to have fun too i want to turn on the stream and i want to do something fun and i

2591
06:57:04,009 --> 06:57:09,750
want to interact and come up with shit and play off you guys what you guys are saying that you guys

2592
06:57:09,750 --> 06:57:22,569
having fun right that's that's why i want that's why i do this let's say yeah we go we go over this

2593
06:57:22,569 --> 06:57:27,560
frequently right because i obviously want to make sure i'm holding up that end of the bargain too

2594
06:57:28,439 --> 06:57:32,759
frequently and we have discussions and talk about hey stay to the channel how things going

2595
06:57:33,479 --> 06:57:38,569
i never wanted to be a bunch of people that are like no this sucks now i don't like it

2596
06:57:39,590 --> 06:57:43,189
i why would i want that i don't want did you say that like for real and i know like

2597
06:57:43,189 --> 06:57:49,220
we're gonna see it right now it's gonna be like oh this sucks right all right i don't but i don't

2598
06:57:49,220 --> 06:57:54,740
want that to be the case and when that gets to be the case that means i'm probably not fucking

2599
06:57:54,740 --> 06:58:02,169
having fun anymore and i'm doing it because i just to do it uh i'm doing because i fucking

2602
06:58:18,580 --> 06:58:22,409
that's the way it's going to continue to be because that's the only way that i can stream

2603
06:58:22,409 --> 06:58:36,389
that's it i can't do it i can't do it any other way but we got two more bits to do well one more

2605
06:58:42,310 --> 06:58:49,689
at least in this kind of sense um that's been very inspirational to me the way that vinnie treats

2606
06:58:49,689 --> 06:58:54,250
his twitch channel when i was just starting out you know i had a youtube audience i had a large

2607
06:58:54,250 --> 06:58:58,490
youtube audience right we moved over here to twitch and i was i was looking around who's who

2608
06:58:58,490 --> 06:59:03,290
and who's doing what and what are they doing and the whole way vinnie doesn't treat his fans like

2609
06:59:03,930 --> 06:59:08,009
money numbers and doesn't read subs and i'm like that's interesting that's

2610
06:59:09,610 --> 06:59:15,580
why you know why why is that so that's one of the reasons why i like vinnie a lot you know he's

2611
06:59:16,540 --> 06:59:24,919
he gets it you know large with quotes what are you doing hey castle griffinstein has like
