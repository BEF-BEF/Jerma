00:07:46,810 --> 00:24:14,789
Hello! Hi, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Germa 985 Holiday Christmas Special, and

2
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:21,869
the award show. I'm Germa, how are you? How's everybody doing? Oh, sorry, it's a little

3
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:29,579
chilly. Oh, it's snowing out there. I have a few things to talk about before we get started.

4
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:35,480
Thank you for joining me on this beautiful holiday afternoon. Over here is a schedule.

5
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,700
Everything you need to see today is right here. Awards are happening, by the way. Medius

6
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:49,039
categories ever. 27 categories this year. There's a lot. I hope you're ready. Oh, not

7
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:53,720
only that, we've got also the elf puzzle room. What is the elf puzzle room? Who knows? You'll

8
00:24:53,720 --> 00:25:00,339
find out very soon. Do I see holiday cheer in the chat yet, please? There is a schedule.

9
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:07,569
Of course there is. Can I see some people Christmas, please? I need to see it. I'm not

10
00:25:07,569 --> 00:25:15,180
going to go any further. Okay, so also, Bugleberry is in the building. Can we get some applause

11
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:23,400
for Bugleberry? Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Gonna be making a nice, delicious holiday

12
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:28,799
turkey from what I've been told. I don't know. We'll see what he comes up with. But also,

13
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,920
what's under the tree here? I'm going to be opening a lot of these presents. Remember

14
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:38,400
we did that a few years ago. They're under here now. It's going to be so nice. It's going

15
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:45,240
to be, I, wait, what's in this one? Hold on. I didn't peek. I promise. Oh, I think that

16
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:51,759
might be an Xbox. It could be an Xbox. I don't know. We'll see. We'll see. But anyways, before

17
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:59,680
we get started, how do you do a holiday show without, of course, an intro, without a musical

18
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:05,799
intro, perhaps? Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome, round of applause, Top Shelf Vocal.

19
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:16,099
Yeah, absolutely. Thank you so much for coming. Really appreciate everybody here. And from

20
00:26:16,099 --> 00:26:19,940
hearing you practice earlier, sounds like you're going to do a little bit of jingle

21
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:26,460
bells from what I understand. Yes, sir. And I'll also be joining you as well as the choir

22
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:34,250
together. Are you guys ready? Okay. Is that okay? Of course it is. Hey, before we start,

23
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:46,950
Merry Christmas. Happy New Year. Let's get started. Dashing through the snow in a one-horse

24
00:26:46,950 --> 00:30:15,779
open sleigh. All the wheels we go laughing all the way. Bells on bobtail. Yeah, we're

25
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:23,549
good. Okay. I think, I think we got our audio back. Yeah. Sorry about that. Sometimes when

26
00:30:23,549 --> 00:30:30,950
you hack into a stream, your audio gets chopped off. We got it back. Welcome. I don't know

27
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:35,069
if you heard, but we're going to be filling this whole stream with modern warfare play

28
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:44,500
from the campaign. We're playing on just regular mode. Should be a lot of fun. So welcome. Just

29
00:30:44,500 --> 00:31:08,180
waiting for the game to load up here. I think I'm out of snacks. Oh, here we go. Let's see.

30
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:22,630
Azra. Azra. Sounds exotic.

31
00:31:33,720 --> 00:32:02,839
Ah, it's that guy with the mask. It's the meme. Okay. So far so good.

32
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:37,980
Hold RB. Ah. The Russians are working with Dairan? I'm looking. I'm looking. Let's see

33
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:44,980
here. Tank. Guy walking around. Guy walking around. Maybe he's by the helicopter. Oh. There

34
00:32:44,980 --> 00:33:02,220
he is. He looks important. As you can see, this is a brand new weapons truck. It's got

35
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:14,589
all of the fixings, eight wheels, two peoples, and a gun. I'll take 10 of them. Yes. My Iranian

36
00:33:14,589 --> 00:33:21,960
Russian soldiers. I'll take 10. They'll love these. Does this also double as a boat? Can

37
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:40,509
it float? Hmm. Alright. I gotta change target. Let's see. Protection detail. Am I, am I

38
00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:44,509
to take them out? Is that what I'm supposed to do? No, right? That can't be right. Not

39
00:33:44,509 --> 00:33:53,329
from this far. Oh, my target. Got it. Marked him. There's the buyer. He's the purchaser

40
00:33:53,329 --> 00:34:29,989
of the brand new 10 vehicles. Go send it. Just send it. Okay. I get to steer it. Controllers.

41
00:34:29,989 --> 00:35:08,679
It looks just like German's Christmas stream. Blown up. Gone. Perfect. And now the briefing

42
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:16,940
several months later. Mr. President. Come in. Leswell. General Shepard. General. I know

43
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:25,219
that look. What's that guy? You would be the first to know, sir. Damn right I would. Talk

44
00:35:25,219 --> 00:35:35,280
to me. We have a hit on Gabrani's second in command. Hassan Zayani. Hassan Zayani. He's

45
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:41,280
taken up the mantle for Iran. Supplying terrorists. Money, weapons, intel. Well, he's ambitious.

46
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,280
He's dangerous, sir. He wants retaliation for the Gabrani strike. He's planning something.

47
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:56,400
Something big. We can't take him in Iran. He's not in Iran, sir. He's on the ground in

48
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:08,139
Al-Mazra. Al-Mazra. It's between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Well, let's get him. When? What

49
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:19,539
time is it now? Now? What better time than now? Send ghost. I have a skull face. Wheels

50
00:36:19,539 --> 00:36:25,539
up in five. Marines are loading in now. You and the sergeant are leading the way on this.

51
00:36:25,539 --> 00:36:32,539
Sergeant. It's open damage. Let's get ourselves away now, team. Save your seats, sir. Save

52
00:36:32,539 --> 00:36:42,980
your seats, sir. Does this guy ever take off his mask? Negative, sir. Out here. Air strikes

53
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:47,980
are hitting enemy positions bordering Al-Mazra. Intel confirms a concentration of AQ fighters

54
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:51,980
converging in the valley. We believe they're protecting something. Surveillance indicates

55
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:57,980
soldiers guarding three structures. Major Hassan may be holed up inside. Ghost and Soap

56
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:02,980
will lead a marine special operations unit to kill or capture Hassan tonight. One Hilo

57
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:07,980
will insert two teams at separate offset points bordering the target area. Bravo team will

58
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:12,980
sweep in clear buildings one and two. Alpha team takes building three. All shooters have

59
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:19,980
got to execute authority, but we want Hassan alive for interrogation. Be advised, Major

60
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:26,980
Hassan is AQ's lifeline. If he is there, they will die for him. Good hunting. Sounds like

61
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:31,980
pretty good surround soldiers. Alpha team stays on board to land down range. Both teams

62
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:43,860
meet in the middle. Remember, we want Hassan alive, but this is capture or kill. Keep up,

63
00:37:43,860 --> 00:38:25,219
sir. I like running, but walking. Doesn't look like I'm running, but I walk. Blackhawk

64
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:42,360
down. Blackhawk down. This is a real Michael Bay situation. Where are we going? What are

65
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:52,800
you saying? What's the deal? Alpha, we're moving to building one. Hold tight. Ghost,

66
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:58,800
we need to secure that crash site. No. First we clear first, son. That takes the heat off

67
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,800
Alpha. Then we secure the crash site. Roger that. Roger that. Let's move. I didn't hear

68
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:42,190
any of that. I'll just follow you guys. Force up to the house. Sweep through. Pow pow. Here

69
00:39:42,190 --> 00:40:03,300
we go. First take clear. Negative on the son. See that. Second deck clear. Roger. Feets.

70
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:34,019
Okay. Three two. All stations, crash site is taking rocket fire from building two. Second

71
00:40:34,019 --> 00:41:05,300
deck. Alpha, take in building two now. Hold fast. Seven one, form up. So we going in there

72
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:22,750
or what's the scoop? Sergeant, second structure now. Second structure. Okay. All right. Seven

73
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:56,090
one. Moving interior. Just stab that guy. Seven one moving to second deck. Sit down.

74
00:41:56,090 --> 00:42:09,780
Enemy rocket stone. Solid copy. Good work. Oops. Ghost, we're secure. Negative on the

75
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:18,780
son. Roger. Kill the woman. That's in the rule of no women, no children. I just broke

76
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:28,219
it. It was an accident. I didn't mean to kill her. Casualty of war. You good, mate? I'm

77
00:42:28,219 --> 00:42:32,219
good. Yeah, please stop it. I mean the PTSD I'll suffer for the next ten years killing

78
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:42,400
an innocent woman. That should be okay. Ghost, Soap. AQ's working with some good gear. Soap,

79
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:48,019
we're moving to the crash site to help the wounded. Rest of you, hold here and cover

80
00:42:48,019 --> 00:42:53,019
us. Roger. Alpha zero two bravo zero seven building two secure. We're coming to you.

81
00:42:53,019 --> 00:43:07,389
Alpha copy's off. Expect contact. AQ's waiting for us. Blue, blue. Damn good to see you guys.

82
00:43:07,389 --> 00:43:14,389
You got five KIA, one wounded. It's just my gun. Five killed. Help me move him. And you

83
00:43:14,389 --> 00:43:22,659
two are alive. Got it. I don't know. Get your gun on that tree line. Let's just leave him.

84
00:43:22,659 --> 00:43:45,599
Private Burr? Sorry. Fire. I see him. I see him. Okay. All right. I don't like that.

85
00:43:45,599 --> 00:44:24,059
What is this? It's so dark. Get your gun up. There we go. We're getting shot from over

86
00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:38,019
there too. Be clear. For now, stay sharp on that tree line. They're still moving out

87
00:44:38,019 --> 00:44:43,699
there. Seven six, call for fire. I want close air on that tree line. Raj, calling it in.

88
00:44:43,699 --> 00:44:53,570
We're not done yet. Zero seven CAS is three minutes out. Roger that. Three minutes? Air

89
00:44:53,570 --> 00:45:26,940
support's inbound. All visual. Incoming. Oh. Oh. Oh. Yay yay yay. I love those who can

90
00:45:26,940 --> 00:47:50,429
smile in trouble. No visual. Back hug down. No visual. Incoming. Man down. Boy, I'm not

91
00:47:50,429 --> 00:48:05,059
good at this campaign. Am I doing this right? Am I supposed to be on a gun or something

92
00:48:05,059 --> 00:48:49,659
like that? Incoming. Yeah, it's heavy. Let's get him. Two three got hit. He's gone. Seven

93
00:48:49,659 --> 00:48:57,019
two, I need you up here now. Raj, moving. Ghost, we should fall back to the host. Negative.

94
00:48:57,019 --> 00:49:02,019
We hold or we push forward. The son's still out there. Seven six, patch us through to

95
00:49:02,019 --> 00:49:09,329
the door. Raj, stand by. Seven actual kilo zero one. Fire is one mic out. Kilo zero

96
00:49:09,329 --> 00:49:14,329
one, you're cleared hot on anything forward of our position. Danger close approved. Roger

97
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:28,079
that. People's incoming. Conserve your ammo. Let them get close. Here they come. Stand

98
00:49:28,079 --> 00:50:11,349
by to engage. Get ready. It's on station. Kilo zero one, gun hit, gun hit. Are we clear?

99
00:50:11,349 --> 00:50:20,579
All clear. All clear. No movement in the area. Roger that, seven six. Kilo zero one, holding

100
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:28,500
pattern. Seven six. None of you dead guys have ammo? Raj. Oh, there we go. The son is

101
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:36,500
still the target. Aye, let's go get this fucker. Alpha, you're with us. Roger that, lieutenant.

102
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:44,059
Let's move out. Stay near, sergeant. Those fuckers used us as bait, didn't they? They're

103
00:50:44,059 --> 00:50:50,059
well supplied and fighting smart, thanks to her son. Aye, looks like you were right.

104
00:50:50,059 --> 00:51:14,420
Your son's still here. Heli crash gave them an opening. Let's see if they took it. Running,

105
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:23,420
but walking. Look at this guy run. This is the worst runner in the history of the military.

106
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:41,539
Oh, yeah. Stay low until we're all clear. Sniper down. Who's hit? Seven four is down.

107
00:51:41,539 --> 00:51:51,840
More snipers on the roof. Take them out. Are they seeing us? AQ's got night vision. We're

108
00:51:51,840 --> 00:52:03,889
sitting ducks out here. Do you have a shot? Good shot. AQ's stuck out here. Whatever they're

109
00:52:03,889 --> 00:52:19,019
defending is fucking big. Seven six, I want fire on that building now. Seven six, hit

110
00:52:19,019 --> 00:52:24,019
that building. Don't level it. Kilo zero will be all for fire. Target is in the building

111
00:52:24,019 --> 00:53:06,260
ahead of us. Do not level the building. Seven six, copy that. Making our way. Try three air

112
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:16,599
support. Yeah, on the side, please. All bravo, move up. I want this building locked down.

113
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:44,300
All the locks busted for sure on this. Seven one, moving interior. Let's see. That was the

114
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:49,300
worst suicide bomber I've ever seen. What was he trying to get done there? That was a bad

115
00:53:49,300 --> 00:54:06,179
guy. You look like a good guy. You look like a good guy. All right, let's give this another

116
00:54:06,179 --> 00:54:24,280
shot here. Suicide bomber, are you still there? Nope. Nope. Hey! What is up with these guys?

117
00:54:24,280 --> 00:56:41,090
It's like they don't like me or something. Break. Okay, I can't hear it. I'm going to

118
00:56:41,090 --> 00:57:11,530
take a break here. I think something's going. All right, let's try something here. Here

119
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:43,079
we go. Where's cat puke trying that brew? I mean, how do you guys feel about this right

120
00:57:43,079 --> 00:58:48,340
here? This award? All right, I've seen enough. I think it's time to get back in here. So

121
00:58:48,340 --> 01:00:23,619
namely elucidate. Here's the last time you'll ever hear that sound. It's very cold. This

122
01:00:23,619 --> 01:00:30,579
is supposed to be hot cocoa with my hot cocoa poetry power. Okay, so the winner, who cares?

123
01:00:30,579 --> 01:00:42,969
Does anybody give a shit about this? Who actually cares? Pre-recorded Andy, what do you say?

124
01:00:42,969 --> 01:00:56,170
There are 27 categories. Ladies and gentlemen, your winner for worst cat puke is, what do

125
01:00:56,170 --> 01:01:06,570
you think? Actual cat puke at 14.4%. You probably saw that one coming. Pitch black cat puke

126
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:14,690
at 14. It was very close. And then eating eggs with 9.8%. By the way, I think two or

127
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:20,179
three years running now, this is the most skipped category. Almost 20% of you that took

128
01:01:20,179 --> 01:01:31,019
this poll just skipped it. What's going on? What's that? The hacker is ahead of you. I

129
01:01:31,019 --> 01:01:40,619
don't understand what that means. What's going on back here? Why is that happening?

130
01:01:40,619 --> 01:01:44,619
Can you put it back to the snow? I want people to think I'm in an actual place with snow.

131
01:01:44,619 --> 01:01:56,739
We're in hell. Hold on. Hey, hey, hey, YouTube. What's going on with my backdrop? Your backdrop

132
01:01:56,739 --> 01:02:02,750
is supposed to be snow and there's like meme shit on it. Are you going to try something?

133
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:09,969
Well, whatever it is, it didn't work. You know what? Why don't we mess with them back?

134
01:02:09,969 --> 01:02:15,530
Why don't we send something that's really going to mess this stuff up? Hello. Stop talking.

135
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:21,519
Nobody talk. Who the fuck are you? Who am I? Who are you? What are you doing on my stream?

136
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:24,519
What do you mean your stream? What do you mean my stream? This is my Christmas special.

137
01:02:24,519 --> 01:02:29,659
What are you doing here? Is this the guy? Is this the fucking guy right here? Hey, bro.

138
01:02:29,659 --> 01:02:36,659
What's up? Hey, bro. What? So this did you just check it? Oh, yeah. He's a hacker. Wow.

139
01:02:36,659 --> 01:02:43,280
He's so skilled. My name is the extinguisher. It's the extinguisher. Wait, what? You will

140
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:50,400
call me by my name. The extinguisher. Your name is the extinguisher. That's right. Did

141
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,960
you get that name like the fifth grade? That sounds like a terrible. It was sixth grade.

142
01:02:54,960 --> 01:03:02,940
The extinguisher. OK, extinguisher. How are you? How are things? Why? What are you doing?

143
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:07,940
What? What? What? What is your goal here? Oh, my goal. My goal is to get you to apologize

144
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:11,940
for all the things you haven't accomplished. You've accomplished tons of stuff. We got

145
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:20,250
dollhouse. We got the what about the 100 gifted subs? 100 gifted subs. Yeah. What do you mean?

146
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:25,250
What happened about you not playing Yakuza? I thought you were going to play that one.

147
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:30,250
Yeah, I'm going to. I didn't play Yakuza. That's why you hacked the stream. And two billion

148
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:35,250
dollars of debt. What are you? The government? That's all right. Well, first of all, there's

149
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:38,250
a couple of things I will let me rebuttal. And after I rebuttal, maybe you'll give the

150
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:43,250
channel back. Well, maybe when you play Glover, Glover, I'll give the channel back. I played

151
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:47,250
Glover. That game sucked. When you play Glover, is that what you're really wrong about here?

152
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:52,420
And the chat loves it. All right. Well, I kind of don't give a shit about anything that

153
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:56,420
you're saying right now, because number one, I did try to give the community subs 100.

154
01:03:56,420 --> 01:04:01,420
My credit card got declined like five times. I did try. My credit card got declined like

155
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:06,420
five times. That's literally what you sound like. Did you get his fucking area yet? You're

156
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:13,050
never going to find me, Jerma. So what the hell are you just coming to taunt us? Is that

157
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:16,610
what you're doing? Is that the fun you're going to have here? Yeah, that's why I'm here.

158
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:22,909
I'm here to taunt you. And I'm here to give the people what they want. Yeah. And what

159
01:04:22,909 --> 01:04:25,909
is that again? You're just like hacking the channel. That's funny. That's funny. Everyone's

160
01:04:25,909 --> 01:04:30,909
laughing about it. They love it. It's fun. Look at them. Look at them in the chat. Okay.

161
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:33,909
Well, thank you. I appreciate hearing from you. Now. Can you please leave me alone? I

162
01:04:33,909 --> 01:04:40,800
should I have to do? Leave me the fuck alone. Wow. No. Yeah. Great respond. No. That's the

163
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:48,099
answer. Um, no. Okay. Well, you know what? What do you got? What do you got? Why don't

164
01:04:48,099 --> 01:04:51,099
we? Why don't we send him something fucked up? How does that sound? You guys have

165
01:04:51,099 --> 01:04:55,099
a connection? Do you have a connection? What if I do this? What do you mean? What do you

166
01:04:55,099 --> 01:05:06,650
mean? What if I do this? Huh? Ah, that's not so fun. Is it? Yeah. Try that on for size.

167
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:13,460
Get that shit. Look at your face. It's so angry. You're such an asshole. Set. Can you

168
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:17,460
have a connection? Right? Send something back. Good. Send something. Send something back

169
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:23,460
right? Shit, you hacker. It's the extinguisher. You will learn my name by the end of this

170
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:33,309
stream. I'm not a gnome. I'm not a gnoblin. Did you do that? I'm a gnome. Can you be

171
01:05:33,309 --> 01:05:43,260
a gnome? What? You're going to gnome the guy? That's so fucking stupid. Did you just gnome

172
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:53,570
on a live stream with over 20,000 people? That's so 2017. Why would you gnome somebody?

173
01:05:53,570 --> 01:06:01,579
That's all you can do back? Get his location and send something else. Get us back access

174
01:06:01,579 --> 01:06:06,710
for the love of God. You're never going to get it back. Give me a fucking break, dude.

175
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:11,710
Never going to get it. You send a gnome over there. You know how bad that makes me look?

176
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:17,710
Never going to get it. We got CatboyGerma. We got the Suski. He even turned off. I don't

177
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:24,710
know. We can't even turn this back to normal. What a disaster. Anyways, I may have made

178
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:32,590
a few of these. Look at him. He's struggling. You know, let's just get right into it. Everybody's

179
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:36,590
waiting for this category, and it's a good one. So let's take our time with it. Ladies

180
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:44,820
and gentlemen, here are the nominees for Worst Face of the Year. Dad, we really don't even

181
01:06:44,820 --> 01:07:07,780
need to cut anything on this one. Just show his face and that should be good. Let's get

182
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:16,599
back to Call of Duty while he does that dumb thing. Alright, so let's see. Open this door.

183
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:42,360
I don't want to drop that gun. Let's see. Oh, somebody just threw a grenade in my right.

184
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:54,050
Wait, where am I?

185
01:08:04,239 --> 01:08:20,170
Chat, man, the chat is going crazy. How do you feel about the extinguisher, chat? Are

186
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:30,779
you liking it? Ah, yes. It's so fat. How do you do that? How do you keep up with this?

187
01:08:30,779 --> 01:08:52,930
Okay. We love the extinguisher. You see that? They love me. The extinguisher strikes. Yes.

188
01:08:52,930 --> 01:09:04,630
Yes, the extinguisher. If you want to see more of me, this might be your only chance.

189
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:15,989
Love it. Alright. Well, I love you too. I love you too, chat. Follow me on all the socials

190
01:09:15,989 --> 01:09:26,340
if you can find me. Not under the extinguisher, that's for sure. I would never use my hacker

191
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:36,939
name as my social media. Rule 101 for being a good hacker. Let's see. I'm going to clear

192
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:53,760
out this room. Yeah, you motherless bastard. Alright. In here. Let's just end your life

193
01:09:53,760 --> 01:10:14,960
just in case. Hey, hey, hey. Did you guys not see me standing there? I tell you, they

194
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:23,960
really, the AI, they just sit there. Just wait for me to get killed. Oh.

195
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:41,670
There we go. One iced. Oh. Hello. Hello, you. I see you. That's it? Where is everyone?

196
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:51,829
Where's the guy? We're looking for Hassan. Hamad. Something with an H. Okay. Let's see.

197
01:10:51,829 --> 01:10:57,899
What do we got here? Bills. Con Ed.

198
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:17,340
What do you think? On the way. We really need to shower. Reapply that makeup. It's creepy.

199
01:11:25,529 --> 01:11:43,789
This isn't a factory of some kind, is it? Are they making widgets here? What do you

200
01:11:43,789 --> 01:11:49,789
guys think of this run? Look at this run. Is this the slowest run in the history of

201
01:11:49,789 --> 01:12:00,300
video game? What is that? What is that? Look at this run. Oh. Disable the night vision.

202
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:15,289
Oh, wow. Did I just, did that just bounce back and hit me? Hey, hey, hey. Follow me

203
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:30,260
for more cod tips. That's clear. You know what? Let's do the night vision off first.

204
01:12:30,260 --> 01:13:00,529
So it doesn't bite. Yeah. Watch your ass there. That was a good one. Yes, I'm going

205
01:13:00,529 --> 01:13:16,789
to slowly run up this. So it's Hassan now. Well, let's add it to Google Maps, shall

206
01:13:16,789 --> 01:13:36,409
we? Here we go. Let's see. What the fuck is this? It's all in English.

207
01:13:36,409 --> 01:19:06,439
You know what? The extinguisher's got to pee. All right. Sorry, that took me a little longer

208
01:19:06,439 --> 01:19:12,439
than normal. My toilet's not working. I had to use my mother's bathroom upstairs. All

209
01:19:12,439 --> 01:19:19,619
right. I hope you didn't miss me too much.

210
01:19:24,619 --> 01:19:51,619
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. America sold weapons to a terrorist. They never do that. They never

211
01:19:51,619 --> 01:20:03,060
do that. Clear the room. Let's go. Everybody out. Everyone except you, lady. She knows.

212
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:12,430
She knows this. Who sold the weapons to Hassan? Iran is in possession of American missiles.

213
01:20:12,430 --> 01:20:18,430
American missiles in AQ's hands. Hassan has been passing out our ballistic missiles like

214
01:20:18,430 --> 01:20:24,430
fucking Halloween. Oh, come on. You can't be surprised about this, General. Oh, deniability,

215
01:20:24,430 --> 01:20:30,430
my ass. Iran's all over this. I want to know how many they have and where they intend to

216
01:20:30,430 --> 01:20:35,430
use them. If Hassan is moving missiles, he has a smuggling partner. I would advise you

217
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:41,609
to find out who that is. Give my team two hours with those missiles, sir. I won't know

218
01:20:41,609 --> 01:20:47,609
everybody who's ever breathed on them. Negative. I want them destroyed. General, there's valuable

219
01:20:47,609 --> 01:20:53,609
intel there. This is an intelligence failure, Laswell. It's not going to be a tactical one.

220
01:20:53,609 --> 01:21:03,170
There will be 500 enemy soldiers on that site by sunrise. We need a win fast. Bad move,

221
01:21:03,170 --> 01:21:08,170
General. Gold Eagle actual to Ghost. Move your team and call for fire. I want those weapons

222
01:21:08,170 --> 01:21:19,590
destroyed. What the hell's Amsterdam got to do with this? It's a smuggling hub. Amsterdam's

223
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:29,520
a smuggling hub? Since when? Who? The captain. I know there's a lot of bikes in Amsterdam,

224
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:36,550
but a smuggling hub? That's the first good news I've heard all day. I'll link up with

225
01:21:36,550 --> 01:21:43,550
him and handle this myself, sir. Kate Laswell back in the field. I want this done right.

226
01:21:43,550 --> 01:21:49,859
No mistakes. Is she going to paint her face and put a skull over her? Kate, I want Hassan

227
01:21:49,859 --> 01:21:58,720
boxed up and gift wrapped. Until then, you keep this tight. The way they talk about human

228
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:11,970
life in this game is it's like a Christmas present. Amsterdam, smuggling hub. Let's go

229
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:32,260
to a cafe. Negative. Guys, you set? Good day, Cap. Yeah, I'm freezing. The water is freezing.

230
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:50,729
What just happened there? Pretty familiar with boating vessels. I'm not sure how or

231
01:22:50,729 --> 01:23:08,279
what they hooked up onto there. Laswell, we're in position. Copy, John. What do you got?

232
01:23:08,279 --> 01:23:12,279
AQ loading cargo into a barge. That's your target. Get aboard and find out who they're

233
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:23,649
working with. Sentries on the perimeter. AQ guard tool over the docks. You'll need to

234
01:23:23,649 --> 01:23:28,649
take him out to get to the barge. Who dresses like that in Amsterdam? Who puts a bandana

235
01:23:28,649 --> 01:23:35,649
over their mouth? I'll take the outside. You clean up the docks. Stay quiet. I'll make

236
01:23:35,649 --> 01:24:19,500
you at a barge. Jack, on you, Cap. For a swim and a steel cold knife to your neck. Another

237
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:46,060
guy had to get up on here. I tell you, this would be a great spot to catch some bass.

238
01:24:46,060 --> 01:25:17,739
Large mouth, small mouth, maybe some crappy. Great structure here for some big fish. I

239
01:25:17,739 --> 01:25:28,109
like his sleeveless shirt here. Into the water with you. Knife to the neck. He sleeps with

240
01:25:28,109 --> 01:26:15,390
the fishes. Ooh, yeah. That was pretty cool. Can I swim as fast as a boat? Apparently.

241
01:26:15,390 --> 01:26:26,579
Why didn't he take him down? I was hitting the button. Unreal. All right, give it another

242
01:26:26,579 --> 01:26:40,250
shot. Follow me for all your Call of Duty tips. The extinguisher. This time, catch you

243
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:49,939
by surprise, mister. I know all of you with your sleeveless puffy jackets. Seriously,

244
01:26:49,939 --> 01:27:11,199
guys. So many. You guys all shop at the same place. Why doesn't he come? Really? Interesting.

245
01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:54,250
These guys shop at TJ Maxx. Right in the gonads. Captain, I think so. Checkpoint reached for

246
01:27:54,250 --> 01:28:14,729
the battle bus. Okay. Seriously, how do I drive this thing? Do I drive this thing?

247
01:28:14,729 --> 01:29:25,600
You know what? Let's just go over here and listen to the barge. What? Yeah. Wait, what?

248
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:38,880
Now what? Oh, sleep. Go to sleep already. Oh, I killed you guys on that boat. Unreal. Unreal.

249
01:29:38,880 --> 01:30:16,390
Did you guys see that? The extinguisher is getting extinguished here in my face. What's

250
01:30:16,390 --> 01:32:31,760
a piece of the extinguisher? Why doesn't it stab him? Let's see. Interesting. Yes. All

251
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:42,000
right. So you know what? It's almost time. Chat, what do you think? Should I give this

252
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:50,850
stream back to Jerma? Should I give this stream back to Jerma? Should I challenge him? Should

253
01:32:50,850 --> 01:33:23,779
I challenge him to a 1v1? What do you think? Extinguisher. All right. All right. You know

254
01:33:23,779 --> 01:33:31,149
what, guys? I think that's what we're going to do. We're going to quit the campaign menu.

255
01:33:31,149 --> 01:34:04,920
Hopefully, that saves there because I've got some stuff to do. Let's see here. An error

256
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:24,479
appeared. Don't say it ain't so. There we go. There we go. All right. The chat has spoken.

257
01:34:24,479 --> 01:34:36,220
They want it. And they're going to get it. I wonder if Jerma will accept the challenge.

258
01:34:36,220 --> 01:35:12,500
In for a world. In for a world of hurt. Get to a menu. It's not hacker. It's extinguisher.

259
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:27,890
Call me extinguisher, please. Still seeing a lot of hacker. Extinguisher, please. Call

260
01:35:27,890 --> 01:35:57,140
me extinguisher. What is happening? Ah, there we go. There we go. Right. No, no. Ah, private

261
01:35:57,140 --> 01:36:10,550
match. Let's see here. Let's create a private match. Free for all? That sounds fun. Let's

262
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:18,050
set up the parameter, shall we? No, no, no. I don't want to start the match yet. Let's

263
01:36:18,050 --> 01:36:27,479
see here. Game rules. Let's go first to five points. We'll do a best of three. And the

264
01:36:27,479 --> 01:36:41,340
map will be shipment because it's small. I don't want him to squirm and hide. Perfect.

265
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:51,420
What now needs to happen is the invite needs to be sent. Which I just sent. Extinguisher.

266
01:36:51,420 --> 01:36:59,729
Yes, I love you, chat. I love you, chat. Thank you for respecting me, extinguisher. I appreciate

267
01:36:59,729 --> 01:37:11,949
it. And you will be rewarded. Oh, yes. You will be rewarded. I promise you. I've got

268
01:37:11,949 --> 01:37:19,090
a list of so many things that Jerma has not delivered on. We will be holding his feet

269
01:37:19,090 --> 01:38:02,699
to the fire. Checking out some things. Let's see how long it takes him to accept this challenge.

270
01:38:02,699 --> 01:38:16,840
Let's see here. What's going on in the chat? Kick his ass, extinguisher. I like it. Thank

271
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:27,520
you, I will. Oh my god, extinguisher. How this moves so fast. But I just want to say thank

272
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:39,199
you to all of you out there for your support. I really do appreciate it. No mercy for Jerma.

273
01:38:39,199 --> 01:38:51,460
No mercy. I will show him none. Man of the chat. I love you, I love you. Extinguisher,

274
01:38:51,460 --> 01:39:02,079
come back. I'm here. Extinguish him. You know what? I'm going to put all of these catch

275
01:39:02,079 --> 01:39:20,039
phrases on a T-shirt. They're great. They're great. Let's see. Let's see what happens

276
01:39:20,039 --> 01:39:30,760
here. If he's got the guts to accept. I mean, a man who dances like that doesn't have usually

277
01:39:30,760 --> 01:40:02,689
guts to accept anything. Except his own mortality. It looks like the chat's on my side, which

278
01:40:02,689 --> 01:40:23,090
I like to see. This is great. I suck? No sir, you suck. Hello? Hey man. Hey dude. Who's

279
01:40:23,090 --> 01:40:35,270
this extinguisher guy? I don't know, he seems like a scum. Yeah, I don't like him. I don't

280
01:40:35,270 --> 01:41:00,039
like him either. Who doesn't like the extinguisher? Nothing but love for the extinguisher. I'm

281
01:41:01,039 --> 01:41:09,890
going to stretch out. Get ready. Get ready for this ass whipping that I will commence

282
01:41:09,890 --> 01:41:49,600
here shortly if Jerma's got any moxie, any temerity, any guts. Hello from Ohio. Ohio?

283
01:41:49,600 --> 01:44:14,380
Alright. Extinguish time. Yeah. He's so chunky. Hey Jerma. Hello Jerma. He's in the corner.

284
01:44:14,380 --> 01:44:20,819
I mean, they all win. It's every single one wins. There's no winner for best auto moment.

285
01:44:20,819 --> 01:44:26,439
It's just anytime he's on camera, it's fun. It's best. Do we need to even, do we declare

286
01:44:26,439 --> 01:44:33,430
a winner? Send the message. They all win, I think. But wow, whoa, actually this is crazy.

287
01:44:33,430 --> 01:44:43,170
Best auto moment of the year is. Hello auto. At 48% of the vote, sleepy auto in Jerma's

288
01:44:43,170 --> 01:44:51,859
arms. And then at 19% snoring in the cheaper bed. And then 11% is auto is a little chunky.

289
01:44:51,859 --> 01:44:59,350
It always gets chunky. What? Who is talking in my ear? Who's what? Hello Jerma. What's

290
01:44:59,350 --> 01:45:05,529
up dude? I've got a proposal for you. I've already heard about it. People have been coming

291
01:45:05,529 --> 01:45:11,529
over here. How's your stream going by the way? My stream? Yeah. How's your stream going?

292
01:45:11,529 --> 01:45:18,090
It's going great. It's going great. How's the Call of Duty campaign? How's that going?

293
01:45:18,090 --> 01:45:24,090
You get through the first part yet? People love it. I'm in the second level. I'm quite

294
01:45:24,090 --> 01:45:30,090
good. People are asking for hot tips and I've been giving them out. Okay. So, and what

295
01:45:30,090 --> 01:45:34,090
can I do for you? I've heard this. Oh, there's a 1v1 scenario. Yes, well, do you want your

296
01:45:34,090 --> 01:45:40,579
stream back or not? I'm feeling Christmassy. Yep. I'm feeling, I'm feeling in the mood.

297
01:45:40,579 --> 01:45:45,949
And you're feeling in the mood for what? Exactly. You want a 1v1 me and Call of Duty and I destroy

298
01:45:45,949 --> 01:45:48,949
you and I get the channel back. That's right. Is that what it is? That's your proposal?

299
01:45:48,949 --> 01:45:55,949
That's the proposal. Yes. So, let me just make sure I break this down completely. If

300
01:45:55,949 --> 01:46:00,949
I beat you in a 1v1 in Call of Duty. That's right. You will give me the channel back.

301
01:46:00,949 --> 01:46:05,949
That's right. No bullshit. I've set up the lobby and everything. First of five, best

302
01:46:05,949 --> 01:46:08,949
of three. First of five, best of three. And you're not messing around or anything. This

303
01:46:08,949 --> 01:46:14,949
is for real. Oh, no, no. I wouldn't lie to you, Jerma. Is he lying? I don't lie. You

304
01:46:14,949 --> 01:46:24,500
lie. Do you have the information from him? They should have it. Do you have it? Yeah.

305
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:30,500
So, if I win, I get the channel back. If you win, you get the channel back. Let's fucking

306
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:37,989
go. Let's go then. Let's go. I need some support back here, please. What do you need? I need,

307
01:46:37,989 --> 01:46:41,989
excuse me. I need a little bit of support here. I don't know anything about Call of Duty.

308
01:46:41,989 --> 01:46:45,989
Time to focus up. Time to focus up. Look alive. Open your mouth. Open your mouth. What is

309
01:46:45,989 --> 01:46:51,989
this, a team? What are we, boxing? You're supposed to do it very gently. We've done

310
01:46:51,989 --> 01:46:55,989
Brover's Bro. We know you're not the best gamer. You got to focus. Stop, stop, stop.

311
01:46:55,989 --> 01:47:01,550
We need this. Listen, listen to me. We need this. Quiet, quiet. Oh, wait a second. What's

312
01:47:01,550 --> 01:47:04,550
the best loadout in Call of Duty Modern Warfare? Can you get him off the fucking screen before

313
01:47:04,550 --> 01:47:09,550
I puke? What is that? Oh, thank you. I appreciate that. I think your play style is a run and

314
01:47:09,550 --> 01:47:13,550
gun. Did you just put makeup on me? You're ready. What did you just do? War paint. Did

315
01:47:13,550 --> 01:47:16,550
you just put war paint on? War paint. This is going to be off for the rest of the day

316
01:47:16,550 --> 01:47:22,550
now. What the hell? You're ready. Just believe in yourself. What's worse, having paint on

317
01:47:22,550 --> 01:47:24,550
your face for the rest of the day or having him on your channel for the rest of the day?

318
01:47:24,550 --> 01:47:31,819
Think about that. Come on. Do or die. Hey, are you a fan of Ludwig? Variety streamer. Do

319
01:47:31,819 --> 01:47:35,819
you know Ludwig at all? He does. Hello? Do you know Atriarch at all? Oh, you're talking

320
01:47:35,819 --> 01:47:39,819
to me. I'm sorry, I'm setting up the game for you because you don't know how to play.

321
01:47:39,819 --> 01:47:44,819
All right, all right, all right. It's time. Am I ready? 1 v 1. I get the channel back.

322
01:47:44,819 --> 01:47:49,819
All right, so first to five. I'll put a 10 minute limit on it. Can I get everybody in

323
01:47:49,819 --> 01:47:53,819
here, please? I need support. I need to be taught how to do this shit. I'm going to choose

324
01:47:53,819 --> 01:47:59,819
the best match. Come on. Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah. What's your class? What's your class? I don't

325
01:47:59,819 --> 01:48:04,819
know what class means, Ludwig. Submachine gun. Long light machine gun. Machine gun. I don't

326
01:48:04,819 --> 01:48:10,819
know what any of this means. Am I in the lobby? Just focus. Don't worry about it yet. Why

327
01:48:10,819 --> 01:48:14,819
am I going to buy stuff in the store? Don't worry about buying things. How do I get this

328
01:48:14,819 --> 01:48:21,810
off? This is going to be on all day. Look, it comes off easy. It'll come off. It'll come

329
01:48:21,810 --> 01:48:28,810
off. Did I get an invite? Why are you buying the skin? I was buying the bundle. Extinguisher.

330
01:48:28,810 --> 01:48:34,810
Who the fuck are you? I'm the engineer. Oh, you were sitting here. Sorry. Extinguisher.

331
01:48:34,810 --> 01:48:42,109
Come on, come on, come on. There you are. Can somebody get me a snack, please? Snacks,

332
01:48:42,109 --> 01:48:52,109
snacks, snacks. Snacks, snacks, snacks. I don't want that. I don't want that either.

333
01:48:52,109 --> 01:48:59,109
Do you want to chew it up? No. Do you need water? If you don't dump it on me. Okay, Jeremy,

334
01:48:59,109 --> 01:49:04,109
you get yourself a little juice box. You get yourself some face paint. All right, go, go,

335
01:49:04,109 --> 01:49:10,109
go. Everyone, I want to start a chant. Are you ready? Let's get this motherfucker. Let's

336
01:49:10,109 --> 01:49:17,109
get this motherfucker. Let's get this motherfucker. Let's get this motherfucker. Start it. Start

337
01:49:17,109 --> 01:49:28,420
it. Start it. Let's go. Are you sure you're ready, Jeremy? Go. Your whole existence is

338
01:49:28,420 --> 01:49:31,420
on the line right now. This engineer was on Facebook for like the last probably hour.

339
01:49:31,420 --> 01:49:37,420
Who have you been writing to on here? Still one of the most popular websites in Europe.

340
01:49:37,420 --> 01:49:44,420
You ready? Let's go. Let's go. Extinguisher. You're the extinguisher? I'm the extinguisher.

341
01:49:44,420 --> 01:49:55,649
What is this? Nutri-grain bar? What is this thing? Fuel. Where are you running to, my

342
01:49:55,649 --> 01:50:03,600
friend? It's just waiting for host. Are you the host? Yes, I'm the host. You have to make

343
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:10,029
the call. Oh, I got to send you another invite because you don't know how to play. I'm in

344
01:50:10,029 --> 01:50:15,029
the lobby right now, extinguisher. Okay. Were you booting me? You know what? You start the

345
01:50:15,029 --> 01:50:19,340
back out of the lobby. Invite him. What the fuck? Invite him. Fight on your turf. Invite

346
01:50:19,340 --> 01:50:26,369
on my turf? I'll play on your turf. It doesn't matter the turf. A lot of friends going on

347
01:50:26,369 --> 01:50:29,369
here. Right there. Right there. That's him. That's him. Yeah, yeah. Where do I go from

348
01:50:29,369 --> 01:50:33,369
here? Join game? Yeah, sure. Join his game. Fuck it. Hey, what do you think about that?

349
01:50:33,369 --> 01:50:38,369
Are we ready? I just backed out of the game. I just backed out of the game. Who are these

350
01:50:38,369 --> 01:50:42,369
people? Who are these people? Get out of that lobby. Who are these people? So many people

351
01:50:42,369 --> 01:50:47,369
in this lobby. Invite him. Invite him. Invite him. I see him. I see him. Join in your

352
01:50:47,369 --> 01:50:51,369
lobby. No, but I think he's in a lobby with a bunch of people. Let's go. Alright, alright,

353
01:50:51,369 --> 01:50:56,760
alright. Come on, Jarvon. No, shit, there's people in here. There's people in here. Who

354
01:50:56,760 --> 01:51:00,760
are these people? I think he's just in a regular lobby. He's in a free brawl. No, this is a

355
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:06,939
private lobby. He's in a free brawl. It's a private match. How are there random people?

356
01:51:06,939 --> 01:51:10,939
How do these people get in the lobby? Who is Moise Bagel? His name is Moise Bagel. The

357
01:51:10,939 --> 01:51:15,939
extinguisher doesn't even know how these people got in. A friend request? No, we're not doing

358
01:51:15,939 --> 01:51:24,239
that. I need somebody from production to help me. Let's see. What happened? You gotta set

359
01:51:24,239 --> 01:51:31,239
up a private party. Maybe customize. Invite him to your party. Create a private match.

360
01:51:31,239 --> 01:51:34,239
It says you're in the main menu. You're supposed to be a hacker. And a free-for-all. He's good

361
01:51:34,239 --> 01:51:38,239
at hacking, not Call of Duty. Invite him to the party here. Well, you leaked the stream

362
01:51:38,239 --> 01:51:46,239
key. It was one of you two. I sent you in a DM. I don't know who leaked it. Well, you

363
01:51:46,239 --> 01:51:49,239
are the one who was supposed to give it to production. Let me tell you right now, don't

364
01:51:49,239 --> 01:51:52,239
have asked me for a stream key in a DM. That's actually stupid and I don't know why I

365
01:51:52,239 --> 01:52:03,239
listen to you. Well, that's true. It goes two ways. No, we love it. We love you. Okay,

366
01:52:03,239 --> 01:52:10,239
good news, he's in our lobby. Good news. Good news, everyone. I am still just thinking about

367
01:52:10,239 --> 01:52:16,239
how much I want to strangle you. Right. Well, okay. Can the other people in the room hear

368
01:52:16,239 --> 01:52:23,239
me? We're trying to get a private match. We can hear you. Can they answer this one question?

369
01:52:23,239 --> 01:52:28,239
Classic. He wants to ask you guys a question. Is his face as red as his hair right now?

370
01:52:28,239 --> 01:52:34,239
What's a good one? Do you want knockout? We want to go free-for-all. Free-for-all. Free-for-all.

371
01:52:34,239 --> 01:52:39,239
All right. Five kills. Finally. I mean, the hacker, seriously, I thought you could set

372
01:52:39,239 --> 01:52:44,239
this whole thing up. Locked. Good to go? You've got a whole team of people. Yeah. Where's

373
01:52:44,239 --> 01:52:49,239
yours, by the way? We're all your team of friends. Yeah, right? Our friendship. Our

374
01:52:49,239 --> 01:52:54,239
Christmas. Right here. Oh, we're going? Let's go. Okay. All right. Focus up. Focus up. Focus

375
01:52:54,239 --> 01:52:59,609
up. Focus up. Focus up. Come on, baby. You keep spilling. Are you ready? You keep aiming

376
01:52:59,609 --> 01:53:03,609
wrong. Is this a good loadout? No, no, no. Custom loadout, too. Try it on one. Yeah,

377
01:53:03,609 --> 01:53:07,609
it's a machine gun. It's a running gun. Running gun. Keep moving. Okay. Keep on your toes.

378
01:53:07,609 --> 01:53:11,609
So should I try to aim into the head or headshots or what? You're not wearing a headset? Headshots

379
01:53:11,609 --> 01:53:15,609
or what? Headshots or what? Just hit him in the body. It doesn't matter. Just shoot him

380
01:53:15,609 --> 01:53:22,380
in the butt. All right. Hey, yeah. Let's go, punk. All right. Okay. Come on, Jerma. Let's

381
01:53:22,380 --> 01:53:25,380
go. You got it, Jerma. You got it, Jerma. You got it, Jerma. Let's go, Jerma. You're

382
01:53:25,380 --> 01:53:28,380
crazy. We need the channel back. We need the channel back. Yes, we really need it. Tighten

383
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:32,380
up. Tighten up. 360. Don't stop, Jerma. Tighten up. We got Pepsi call on the phone. We got

384
01:53:32,380 --> 01:53:36,380
everybody screaming at us. There we go. That's one, Jerma. Okay. Yeah, I can count. Aiming

385
01:53:36,380 --> 01:53:41,380
a little low. Aiming a little low. Okay. Come now. Where are you? Keep the energy on him.

386
01:53:41,380 --> 01:53:46,380
Come on. Are you camped? It's lame to camp. He can hear you. Why are you camping? Because

387
01:53:46,380 --> 01:53:51,380
I need my fucking channel. Good camp, Jerma. It's just lame. It's just lame. Are you laying

388
01:53:51,380 --> 01:53:59,380
down, Jerma? And now he can hear us and you fucked it up. I see you, Jerma. I see you.

389
01:53:59,380 --> 01:54:13,380
I saw your cute little butt. Let's go. He's made things interesting. He's made things

390
01:54:13,380 --> 01:54:24,619
interesting. Iron, but get steel, baby. Your butt was nice in those pants. Is this a bad

391
01:54:24,619 --> 01:54:29,619
idea? Yeah, you're lying down in the middle of the square. There's a lot of openings.

392
01:54:29,619 --> 01:54:42,109
Reduce the amount of entries he could see. This might fuck him up. Wow. Thank you so

393
01:54:42,109 --> 01:54:47,109
much. Wow. Are you going to lay down the whole time? I'm not going to lay down the whole

394
01:54:47,109 --> 01:54:51,109
time. I mean, let's go ahead and pound it right there. You're not going to lay down

395
01:54:51,109 --> 01:54:59,109
the whole time? No, not anymore. Running gun. Head shot. Head shot. Right in the butt.

396
01:54:59,109 --> 01:55:04,109
Walk around a corner. Should I go around a corner? Look at you. But I don't know what

397
01:55:04,109 --> 01:55:08,109
the hell he is. How am I supposed to know that? So you have to go around a corner safely.

398
01:55:08,109 --> 01:55:12,109
Ludwig, I don't think you understand that this guy's on my channel right now. What is that?

399
01:55:12,109 --> 01:55:16,109
You don't understand if you fucking lose this game, you don't get your channel back. Yes,

400
01:55:16,109 --> 01:55:22,109
the channel. I'm thinking of calling the channel The Extinguisher. Twitch is not going to

401
01:55:22,109 --> 01:55:25,109
let you change my name to The Extinguisher. I'm going to change it to The Extinguisher

402
01:55:25,109 --> 01:55:38,109
986. How many viewers does he have on that channel? 400 million. How many people are

403
01:55:38,109 --> 01:55:42,109
actually on that channel? He's like a 30, 40K. He's big. Like I actually, I'm asking if

404
01:55:42,109 --> 01:55:52,569
you want to do an upgrade. That's it. That's it. It's the first of five. The first of five.

405
01:55:52,569 --> 01:56:00,569
You're hitting me a little hard. It is a flaw you have. It does it a lot. Wow. First of

406
01:56:00,569 --> 01:56:03,569
five kills. It's first of five and we got two rounds, three rounds. All right, come on.

407
01:56:03,569 --> 01:56:08,569
Tighten up. Two more kills. Two more. Two more kills. Maybe reload. Maybe reload. What?

408
01:56:08,569 --> 01:56:13,569
Reload. Oh, I thought it automatically did that. You're still not reloading. What are you

409
01:56:13,569 --> 01:56:17,569
talking about? I pressed R. That doesn't make any sense. You lung canceled it. That's all

410
01:56:17,569 --> 01:56:20,569
good. You know what? You have your own style. What are you doing? You are shooting the bag

411
01:56:20,569 --> 01:56:32,199
and you are, okay. Hey, hacker. Hey, Extinguisher. Yeah. Hey, are you playing with a

412
01:56:32,199 --> 01:56:47,439
controller? He's playing with a controller. Let me just touch that. He's got a controller.

413
01:56:47,439 --> 01:56:55,439
Yeah, not so funny now anymore, huh? And don't do this when you're talking to him. With your

414
01:56:55,439 --> 01:56:59,439
controller. You've been talking about your hands on the mouse. Okay. It's first of five.

415
01:56:59,439 --> 01:57:08,439
You don't lead there. Three to three. Oh, drop on him. Drop on him. Drop on him. This

416
01:57:08,439 --> 01:57:13,439
thing sucks. One more. Were you dancing on top of that car? Tighten up. Tighten up. Slow

417
01:57:13,439 --> 01:57:32,869
down. Slow down. Everybody quiet in the room. Shit. I don't want to press the button. Get

418
01:57:32,869 --> 01:57:36,869
away from the bus, Jerma. What? Don't go near the bus? Stay away from the bus. Dude,

419
01:57:36,869 --> 01:57:41,869
stop. I walked around the bus. Dude, the bus is, yeah, I should hide under the bus to be

420
01:57:41,869 --> 01:57:45,869
able to find when he walks by, right? No, it's a bad idea. Oh, you're doing it, though.

421
01:57:45,869 --> 01:57:49,869
You're doing it no matter what we say. It's all right, though. It doesn't matter. Man,

422
01:57:49,869 --> 01:57:56,869
if he came from behind the bus right now. And aimed only at the bus. He would kill you.

423
01:57:56,869 --> 01:58:06,420
The extinguisher is in. Yes. Bring it home. You're adorable. That went down my entire

424
01:58:06,420 --> 01:58:12,420
body. I need one more kill and that's it. One more. One more for the channel. One more.

425
01:58:12,420 --> 01:58:17,420
Come on, this is for the channel. Come on, baby. Are you nervous? Are you nervous? Tighten

426
01:58:17,420 --> 01:58:21,420
up. Oh, and the extinguisher is coming for me. Is that what you're saying? The extinguisher

427
01:58:21,420 --> 01:58:40,220
is coming for me. Oh, look at that. That's your channel. That's your channel. Best of

428
01:58:40,220 --> 01:58:45,220
three is not over yet. Best of three. It's actually my channel now, isn't it? Oh, yeah,

429
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:50,220
best of three. Yeah, you want two more chances? No, this best of three. You said best of three.

430
01:58:50,220 --> 01:58:54,220
I did say best of three. I'll give you best of three. You said best out of three. I did.

431
01:58:54,220 --> 01:59:02,220
I did. Are you nervous? Look at your friends. Your friends are all hands on faces. They

432
01:59:02,220 --> 01:59:09,539
don't look like the beach boys anymore. They look like the beach bums. Look at them. I

433
01:59:09,539 --> 01:59:13,539
don't know what to do. Go, go, go. I'm not ready. I'm ready. I don't know what to do.

434
01:59:13,539 --> 01:59:22,460
Go, go. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I cannot hear anything you guys are saying, by the way.

435
01:59:22,460 --> 01:59:28,460
These are noise canceling headphones. Look at them praying behind you. They're worried.

436
01:59:28,460 --> 01:59:36,460
They're worried. Is this a good loadout? Yeah. Good. Good. Good. You think it's good? Okay.

437
01:59:36,460 --> 01:59:55,020
Keep it up. I'm walking this way. What I like about him is he seems like he'll stand by

438
01:59:55,020 --> 02:00:03,260
what he promises. I think that's what a sponsor wants. You got it, baby. Keep it up, kid. You

439
02:00:03,260 --> 02:00:10,189
got it. All right. What was that? I thought you gave it a finger. Hey, extinguisher, deal

440
02:00:10,189 --> 02:00:20,300
with this one, bud. Well, I like that you're calling me extinguisher. Well, I don't know

441
02:00:20,300 --> 02:00:24,979
your name. It's the only thing you said. You know my name. You drained my bank account,

442
02:00:24,979 --> 02:00:32,909
too. Wait, what was that over there? Although I've heard you're two billion in debt. That's

443
02:00:32,909 --> 02:00:42,819
fucking bullshit. Yeah. Yeah. By the way, I can hear every single thing you guys said.

444
02:00:42,819 --> 02:00:53,970
Let's go, Jerma. Let's go, Big J. Jerma, Jerma, Jerma. That doesn't sound very confident.

445
02:00:53,970 --> 02:01:00,970
That chant sounds a little weak. Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma. Doesn't hit as hard. That chant

446
02:01:00,970 --> 02:01:10,100
sounds a little weak, Jerma. You fell down. I got to tell you, I love shooting you in

447
02:01:10,100 --> 02:01:15,100
your cute little butt. First to five, you got it, baby. First to five. Yeah. Your cheeks

448
02:01:15,100 --> 02:01:21,100
are... Yeah, you are a fucking cop. They're clapping. Press Q. Q? Cheeks be clapping.

449
02:01:21,100 --> 02:01:32,460
What's that? What the hell is... What was that? Ludwig, what the hell was that? Try E. E?

450
02:01:32,460 --> 02:01:38,260
Is this a grenade? I think so. Did he sit there? You think so? I don't know. It just was

451
02:01:38,260 --> 02:01:43,260
on... I just saw the bottom right. He's holding a grenade. But the icon doesn't look like

452
02:01:43,260 --> 02:01:56,189
a grenade. It could be like a Molotov. I hear him. Fuck it up. Come into the room in the

453
02:01:56,189 --> 02:02:00,189
back, near the car. Hey, extinguisher, if you come into the room with the guy with the

454
02:02:00,189 --> 02:02:12,039
gun at the camera... Oh, poor Jerma. I need to get one kill. Come on, come on, come on,

455
02:02:12,039 --> 02:02:19,039
baby. Are your palms sweaty? No, they're actually very dry. Thanks for asking, though.

456
02:02:19,039 --> 02:02:25,800
Your lips? I can help. Yeah, thank you. Is it because you smudged the war paint, do you

457
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:34,560
think? Could I... Jerma. Get this... Put it over there. Don't... Your butt's bloody. Come

458
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:40,819
on, come back, come back, come back, come back. Come back, she's in. Holiday spirit. That's

459
02:02:41,819 --> 02:02:49,979
what we need right now. Holiday spirit. Stop touching me so I can focus. I have fun. I

460
02:02:49,979 --> 02:03:10,729
have fun. This is so fun. Jerma. Oh, Jerma. Jerma. Jerma. Oh, oh, oh. Reasonable. I want

461
02:03:11,729 --> 02:03:16,729
everybody else in the background. Out of the room. Welcome to my channel. The Extinguisher

462
02:03:16,729 --> 02:03:24,279
986. Go to break. Just go to the elves. Go to the elves. Go to the elves. Go to the elves.

463
02:03:24,279 --> 02:03:46,279
Extinguisher. Look at the chat. They're going crazy. Sweep. Extinguisher. Gotta love playing

464
02:03:46,279 --> 02:03:55,819
PC players on a controller. And I won. You see? Not so bad after all. Gets a bad rap

465
02:03:55,819 --> 02:04:05,390
to controller. Really. New era. So much easier. A lot less carpal tunnel. Can I get one more

466
02:04:05,390 --> 02:04:14,369
of those? All right. Grab me one more of those. That feels good. I feel good. I feel real

467
02:04:14,369 --> 02:04:23,699
good. Five and O. Look at the chat. Thank you so much. I was like. Yes. I'm good for

468
02:04:23,699 --> 02:04:34,430
now. Yes. Extinguisher. I would love to see his face right now. Do they have enough keyboards

469
02:04:34,430 --> 02:04:42,310
for him to break, I wonder? You don't have to have a mic or anything. Do they have enough

470
02:04:42,310 --> 02:04:49,310
keyboards for him to break? What do you think, chat? Are there enough keyboards on the planet

471
02:04:49,310 --> 02:05:09,619
for Jerma to break? Right now. There's no progress in this room. What is this? Do that

472
02:05:09,619 --> 02:05:37,970
one. Do this one. There's nothing even here. God damn it. Hey! Look at this. Look at Jerma.

473
02:05:37,970 --> 02:05:43,970
They're all drunk. They're all drunk. Shooting him in the face. Wow. Look at this feasting

474
02:05:46,810 --> 02:06:20,840
One sippage. Christmas is over. A little thermite on your nuts. God bless America. Land that

475
02:06:20,840 --> 02:06:33,170
I love. Let's see. What's this? Oh, more bullets. Great. They won't be able to recognize you.

476
02:06:33,170 --> 02:06:42,180
We're going to have to put you in the tomb of the unknown soldier. That felt good. You

477
02:06:42,180 --> 02:06:53,189
know what? Extinguisher is a little hungry after that victory. I'm going to go get a

478
02:06:53,189 --> 02:11:29,739
snack. What are you going to do? Okay. All right. Don't do anything too weird though.

479
02:11:29,739 --> 02:11:48,380
Oh my God. Don't do anything too weird. You all right? What the fuck are you doing? That's

480
02:11:48,380 --> 02:12:00,699
connected to the toilet. That's not connected to anything. What? What? Okay. All right. I'll

481
02:12:00,699 --> 02:12:12,890
hold on to something. I'm holding on. Whoa. What is that? What is going on? What the fuck?

482
02:12:12,890 --> 02:12:43,739
Jesus. I'm nothing. I don't want to do anything. Bugleberry. You could do something else maybe.

483
02:12:43,739 --> 02:13:01,340
Do something else. Something else. Do something else. I don't want to do that. Dude. No. No.

484
02:13:01,340 --> 02:13:07,340
We'll sacrifice something else. Something else. Maybe. Does a crew member have something that

485
02:13:07,340 --> 02:13:21,630
we can put in? Maybe like a. No. No. No. No. No. Don't let it. Don't touch those presents.

486
02:13:21,630 --> 02:13:28,630
Don't touch those presents. Those are my presents. Do not touch them. No. Get out of here. No.

487
02:13:28,630 --> 02:13:33,630
No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Please. Please. At least leave a couple. I'm taking this one.

488
02:13:33,630 --> 02:13:39,060
This is my present. These are my presents. Bugleberry. Come on. There's got to be something

489
02:13:39,060 --> 02:13:47,140
else you can do besides this. Don't listen. Don't listen to him. It's. Dude. Wait. Is he

490
02:13:47,140 --> 02:13:54,090
still there? Bugleberry. Wait. Stop. Stop. Can you hear me? What the fuck? Dude. You can't

491
02:13:54,090 --> 02:14:01,350
do. I need. Those are mine. I don't even know what's in those. Can it pump me into him? Is he

492
02:14:01,350 --> 02:14:07,420
still there? Bugleberry. Can you hear me? Can I leave? Don't touch. Leave a couple please.

493
02:14:07,420 --> 02:14:14,479
Oh my God. Chet's telling me to watch out. What's going on? I don't want to do this. I don't

494
02:14:14,479 --> 02:14:23,970
want to do this. Bugleberry. I don't want to do this. Anything else please. Anything else.

495
02:14:23,970 --> 02:14:50,869
Anything else. Is it an iPhone? Jesus. Xbox. The chat seems to be running me. That's my Xbox.

496
02:14:50,869 --> 02:14:58,210
They're telling me to run. Bugleberry. Don't put that one in maybe. That's an Xbox. Where am I?

497
02:14:58,210 --> 02:15:17,329
I can't run? Jesus. Where am I going to go? God. I'm a medium. I'm a medium. I'm going in.

498
02:15:17,329 --> 02:15:28,000
I'm going in there. I'm going in. I'm going in. No. Let me in. Fucking come on. Get off of me.

499
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:45,500
My tongue's gotten dry. That game sucks. I don't care. Put that one in. Put that one in. I don't care.

500
02:15:45,500 --> 02:15:56,529
That's probably the only one I don't care about. What is it? What's in it? Don't put it in.

501
02:15:56,529 --> 02:16:02,069
Don't put that one in. Leave me one present Bugleberry. Please. One present. Thank you.

502
02:16:02,069 --> 02:16:18,970
Thank God I only get one. Jesus. I have no idea. I just feel sick. I don't know. What should I be

503
02:16:18,970 --> 02:16:38,659
feeling? What are you doing? Two points. Yeah. Bugleberry. I feel fucking sick. What was it?

504
02:16:38,659 --> 02:16:54,569
Bugleberry. Something's wrong. How do you feel? What the fuck was that? Bugleberry. Stop. Stop. Stop it right.

505
02:16:54,569 --> 02:17:10,270
Please stop. I don't even know what's happening. My chest hurts. My chest hurts. Is it even doing anything?

506
02:17:10,270 --> 02:17:23,600
I don't think it's doing anything. I don't think it's working. I don't know. I don't think so. Maybe.

507
02:17:23,600 --> 02:17:30,600
I don't. Nothing's happening. I don't think it's happening.

508
02:17:30,600 --> 02:17:41,899
Get the channel back now, did I? No. You know what? Fuck. You are powerful. Magical listeners.

509
02:17:42,899 --> 02:17:49,549
No. Stop.

510
02:17:49,549 --> 02:18:23,860
Dude, easy on the language please. Bugleberry. Are you okay?

511
02:18:23,860 --> 02:18:48,819
No. What the fuck just happened? What happened? What's going on? You piece of shit. It's you. It's you motherfucker.

512
02:18:48,819 --> 02:18:58,819
I see you now. I see you. I can see you. What do I do about this? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?

513
02:18:58,819 --> 02:19:06,819
Oh, now you're scared. That's why I had a magician. I know a guy. You know hacking. I got dark magic motherfucker.

514
02:19:06,819 --> 02:19:14,780
What did you do? What did you do? What is that? What is that?

515
02:19:14,780 --> 02:19:22,280
I know we don't really know each other and this is really strange. It's really weird. Is your room cold right now?

516
02:19:22,280 --> 02:19:35,219
It's very cold. My nips are. Yeah. Do you see what is under here? Yes. I have something down here. I don't know what this is. It's a swirling thing.

517
02:19:35,219 --> 02:19:46,219
Do you have one of those in your room, dude? Yeah. Yes. Okay. I'll be honest. This is kind of freaking me out. I know Bugleberry. Hopefully Bugleberry is okay.

518
02:19:46,219 --> 02:19:52,459
Do we call someone? I don't know, man. Hold on. Let me put my hand in here. Don't. Don't.

519
02:19:52,459 --> 02:20:05,659
Can you see? What the fuck? Ow. Don't. Ow. Ow. Was that you? Was that you? Was that you? Was that you? I don't know.

520
02:20:05,659 --> 02:20:14,100
Did it feel like someone slapped your hand? It felt like somebody touched my hand. Did you touch me? That was me.

521
02:20:14,100 --> 02:20:26,870
Man, you motherfucker. How does that feel, huh? Does that feel weird? Does that feel weird? Does it? Stop. Stop. Stop. God damn it.

522
02:20:26,870 --> 02:20:35,500
You don't choke me. All right, man. You want to fuck around? How does this? Does this sound? No. Don't. Don't. Don't you?

523
02:20:35,500 --> 02:20:47,040
I'm going to kick you in the goddamn face. How does that sound? Don't you? Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Ow. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Put it back.

524
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:57,950
What is wrong with you? Those were nice kids, by the way. Yeah, they are nice shoes. I'm glad you like them. You know what?

525
02:20:57,950 --> 02:21:07,829
Look at you. My camera's all twisted. How do you feel about this, you piece of shit? It's a piece of wood. Yeah, it's a piece of wood.

526
02:21:07,829 --> 02:21:13,829
It'll knock your fucking teeth out. What are you going to do with a piece of wood? I'm coming in there and I'm going to knock your head off.

527
02:21:13,829 --> 02:21:27,139
Oh, hold it right there, boys. Santa. This has got to stop. This is not the Christmas spirit. What? Santa.

528
02:21:27,139 --> 02:21:37,139
What is this? You've got to. You've got to. Young man, get over here. What do you mean? There's a Santa here? I mean, that's kind of funny.

529
02:21:38,139 --> 02:21:51,530
There was nobody here before. Put that stick down. What? I remember the last time you used that stick. It's real. It's him. It's really him.

530
02:21:51,530 --> 02:22:03,530
That's a real Santa. That's a real Santa. Dude, bro. This is the real Santa, I think. We cannot have any more of this. You are ruining Christmas with your dark magic and your foul mouth.

531
02:22:03,530 --> 02:22:13,530
I don't know what to say, but I mean, the magic was not with me. I hired somebody to come and hang out. I don't know what to say.

532
02:22:13,530 --> 02:22:22,530
Well, my magic-ometer sensed it all the way from the North Pole that something was not right in this place and I've come to set the Christmas spirit right again.

533
02:22:22,530 --> 02:22:32,829
Okay. Okay. But that's going to require change on both of your parts. Okay. What do you mean? What do you want us to do?

534
02:22:32,829 --> 02:22:42,829
I want you to reconcile as brothers. I want an apology from both of you. And we're going to start with Extinguisher. With me, Santa?

535
02:22:42,829 --> 02:22:49,829
Yes. You get the chance to go first to be nice and to apologize to this little boy.

536
02:22:49,829 --> 02:23:03,950
When you put it like that, I'm sorry, Jerma, for hacking your stream and playing the best game of Call of Duty that I've ever put on board.

537
02:23:03,950 --> 02:23:07,510
Yeah. My bad.

538
02:23:07,510 --> 02:23:09,510
Anything else?

539
02:23:09,510 --> 02:23:14,889
You're not. I really do like your butt cheeks.

540
02:23:14,889 --> 02:23:17,889
There's no place for that here, Extinguisher.

541
02:23:17,889 --> 02:23:18,889
Thank you.

542
02:23:18,889 --> 02:23:23,280
It was a compliment, Santa, but you're right.

543
02:23:23,280 --> 02:23:26,280
Well, I mean, Santa, he hacked my-

544
02:23:26,280 --> 02:23:27,280
Don't apologize.

545
02:23:27,280 --> 02:23:29,280
He hacked my channel and he tried to-

546
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:31,280
Excuses.

547
02:23:31,280 --> 02:23:36,280
He wiped out my bank account and he hacked the channel and I ruined my Christmas show and it was really kind of annoying.

548
02:23:36,280 --> 02:23:38,280
Selfishness.

549
02:23:38,280 --> 02:23:40,280
Doesn't sound like an apology.

550
02:23:40,280 --> 02:23:41,280
No, it's not.

551
02:23:42,280 --> 02:23:48,159
Extinguisher, I am sorry that I called you a dork.

552
02:23:48,159 --> 02:23:51,159
I said that your hacking abilities weren't very good.

553
02:23:51,159 --> 02:23:56,159
I mean, you seem like kind of a nice guy and then you seem like pretty cool.

554
02:23:56,159 --> 02:23:58,159
So I'm sorry.

555
02:23:58,159 --> 02:23:59,159
Really?

556
02:23:59,159 --> 02:24:00,159
Yeah.

557
02:24:00,159 --> 02:24:03,159
Is that sincere, young man?

558
02:24:03,159 --> 02:24:07,159
Yeah. And that's- I also maybe want to say sorry to the crew.

559
02:24:07,159 --> 02:24:09,159
I think I was a little mean earlier.

560
02:24:09,159 --> 02:24:11,159
I've just been under a lot of stress.

561
02:24:11,159 --> 02:24:12,159
Stress?

562
02:24:12,159 --> 02:24:13,159
Stress.

563
02:24:13,159 --> 02:24:16,159
And who else do you need to apologize to?

564
02:24:16,159 --> 02:24:22,159
Maybe my mother because she thought I was going to be a doctor and I ended up being a clown on the internet.

565
02:24:22,159 --> 02:24:24,159
But I mean, still doing pretty well.

566
02:24:24,159 --> 02:24:26,159
And sorry, Mom.

567
02:24:26,159 --> 02:24:28,159
I think that covers it.

568
02:24:28,159 --> 02:24:30,159
Anyone else?

569
02:24:30,159 --> 02:24:31,159
Dermot.

570
02:24:31,159 --> 02:24:34,899
Oh, right.

571
02:24:34,899 --> 02:24:36,899
The two by four.

572
02:24:36,899 --> 02:24:40,899
I'm sorry, Santa, for- I didn't know.

573
02:24:40,899 --> 02:24:41,899
How am I supposed to know when I-

574
02:24:41,899 --> 02:24:42,899
Excuses.

575
02:24:42,899 --> 02:24:45,899
But how am I supposed to know that it was you?

576
02:24:45,899 --> 02:24:47,899
I didn't mean to get you with that.

577
02:24:47,899 --> 02:24:48,899
I'm sorry.

578
02:24:48,899 --> 02:24:49,899
Spit it out.

579
02:24:49,899 --> 02:24:51,899
I'm very sorry to everybody.

580
02:24:51,899 --> 02:24:52,899
Okay.

581
02:24:52,899 --> 02:24:54,899
Well, that's what I like to hear.

582
02:24:54,899 --> 02:24:57,899
And Santa likes when you make nice.

583
02:24:57,899 --> 02:24:58,899
Thank you.

584
02:24:58,899 --> 02:24:59,899
This is very big.

585
02:24:59,899 --> 02:25:01,899
You're welcome.

586
02:25:01,899 --> 02:25:02,899
I have a big candy cane.

587
02:25:02,899 --> 02:25:10,899
And now, now that we have reconciliation here, I can finally grant you your Christmas wishes.

588
02:25:10,899 --> 02:25:14,069
You've been so nice, extinguisher.

589
02:25:14,069 --> 02:25:17,069
What would you like for Christmas?

590
02:25:17,069 --> 02:25:20,069
Dude, you got a Christmas wish, dude.

591
02:25:20,069 --> 02:25:21,069
What are you going to do?

592
02:25:21,069 --> 02:25:22,069
Oh.

593
02:25:22,069 --> 02:25:23,069
Um.

594
02:25:23,069 --> 02:25:25,250
Oh, I got it.

595
02:25:25,250 --> 02:25:30,250
Can you please, please make me silver in League of Legends?

596
02:25:30,250 --> 02:25:34,250
It's about time you got out of bronze.

597
02:25:34,250 --> 02:25:35,250
Yeah.

598
02:25:35,250 --> 02:25:38,250
Wow.

599
02:25:38,250 --> 02:25:39,250
Did you get it?

600
02:25:39,250 --> 02:25:40,250
There you go.

601
02:25:40,250 --> 02:25:41,250
I'm silver.

602
02:25:41,250 --> 02:25:42,250
Whoa.

603
02:25:42,250 --> 02:25:43,250
Thanks, Santa.

604
02:25:43,250 --> 02:25:45,250
You're welcome, little boy.

605
02:25:45,250 --> 02:25:46,250
It worked?

606
02:25:46,250 --> 02:25:47,250
You're actually silver?

607
02:25:47,250 --> 02:25:48,250
Yeah.

608
02:25:48,250 --> 02:25:49,250
Dude, that's sick.

609
02:25:49,250 --> 02:25:50,250
So sick.

610
02:25:50,250 --> 02:25:51,250
Wow.

611
02:25:51,250 --> 02:25:54,250
And now, for you, Turamo.

612
02:25:54,250 --> 02:25:55,250
Money.

613
02:25:55,250 --> 02:25:56,250
Oh, that's a good one.

614
02:25:56,250 --> 02:25:57,250
Agreed.

615
02:25:57,250 --> 02:25:58,250
10 million, at least.

616
02:25:58,250 --> 02:25:59,250
Wow, damn money.

617
02:25:59,250 --> 02:26:00,250
Okay.

618
02:26:00,250 --> 02:26:01,250
Try again.

619
02:26:01,250 --> 02:26:02,250
I asked for that.

620
02:26:02,250 --> 02:26:09,870
I wish for the things to kind of go back to normal, the way they were before.

621
02:26:09,870 --> 02:26:12,870
Before Extinguisher came on and hacked.

622
02:26:12,870 --> 02:26:16,870
I'd like to do the rest of my awards and just chill and have a good time.

623
02:26:16,870 --> 02:26:19,870
The way things should have been had you been nice.

624
02:26:19,870 --> 02:26:21,559
That's true.

625
02:26:21,559 --> 02:26:22,559
Ho, ho, ho.

626
02:26:22,559 --> 02:26:23,559
You're right.

627
02:26:23,559 --> 02:26:24,559
Santa can do that.

628
02:26:24,559 --> 02:26:26,950
Whoa.

629
02:26:26,950 --> 02:26:27,950
Did it work?

630
02:26:27,950 --> 02:26:28,950
How do you feel?

631
02:26:28,950 --> 02:26:29,950
I feel great.

632
02:26:29,950 --> 02:26:30,950
Do you?

633
02:26:30,950 --> 02:26:31,950
You're all jiggly inside.

634
02:26:31,950 --> 02:26:32,950
Dude, hey.

635
02:26:32,950 --> 02:26:33,950
How about this?

636
02:26:33,950 --> 02:26:34,950
I'll take you to lunch.

637
02:26:34,950 --> 02:26:35,950
What?

638
02:26:35,950 --> 02:26:38,950
I've got at least 10 minutes on Friday.

639
02:26:39,950 --> 02:26:42,950
I've got at least 10 minutes on Friday if you want to hang out.

640
02:26:42,950 --> 02:26:45,950
I've got 15 minutes on Friday.

641
02:26:45,950 --> 02:26:47,579
Yeah.

642
02:26:47,579 --> 02:26:49,579
I've got an hour on Friday.

643
02:26:49,579 --> 02:26:50,579
Minimum.

644
02:26:50,579 --> 02:26:53,579
Oh, that calls for a real sit-down restaurant.

645
02:26:53,579 --> 02:26:54,579
Do a group Tuesdays?

646
02:26:54,579 --> 02:26:56,579
Yeah, let's do it.

647
02:26:56,579 --> 02:26:57,579
All right.

648
02:26:57,579 --> 02:26:58,579
Good for you.

649
02:26:58,579 --> 02:26:59,579
You and me are going to go.

650
02:26:59,579 --> 02:27:03,579
It's good to see you playing nice together again.

651
02:27:03,579 --> 02:27:04,579
Thank you.

652
02:27:04,579 --> 02:27:05,579
Thank you.

653
02:27:05,579 --> 02:27:06,579
Thank you.

654
02:27:06,579 --> 02:27:07,579
Bye-bye.

655
02:27:07,579 --> 02:27:08,579
Santa, thank you so much.

656
02:27:08,579 --> 02:27:09,579
Thank you so much.

657
02:27:09,579 --> 02:27:10,579
That was unbelievable.

658
02:27:10,579 --> 02:27:11,579
Bye, everyone.

659
02:27:11,579 --> 02:27:14,579
The power of Christmas.

660
02:27:14,579 --> 02:27:15,579
Yeah.

661
02:27:15,579 --> 02:27:16,579
And the right magic.

662
02:27:16,579 --> 02:27:17,579
Not that dark stuff.

663
02:27:17,579 --> 02:27:19,579
You can never go back to that again.

664
02:27:19,579 --> 02:27:21,579
Well, I think Beulah Berry might be dead.

665
02:27:21,579 --> 02:27:22,579
Or he's gone.

666
02:27:22,579 --> 02:27:27,579
I have no idea where he is, but we might not see him for a long time.

667
02:27:27,579 --> 02:27:31,579
And remember, the mouth speaks out of that which fills the heart.

668
02:27:31,579 --> 02:27:32,579
That's true.

669
02:27:32,579 --> 02:27:34,579
So keep changing that.

670
02:27:34,579 --> 02:27:37,579
And to all the community out there,

671
02:27:37,579 --> 02:27:44,579
I want to remind you that this is the season for giving and forgiving.

672
02:27:44,579 --> 02:27:48,579
And a Merry Christmas to all.

673
02:27:48,579 --> 02:27:49,579
Thank you, Santa.

674
02:27:49,579 --> 02:27:52,200
Seriously.

675
02:27:52,200 --> 02:27:54,200
And Extinguisher, I'm serious.

676
02:27:54,200 --> 02:27:55,200
We should go hang out.

677
02:27:55,200 --> 02:27:56,200
I'm sorry.

678
02:27:56,200 --> 02:27:58,200
It is the spirit for giving.

679
02:27:58,200 --> 02:28:04,889
It is the spirit for reconciliation and hanging out and having a good time.

680
02:28:04,889 --> 02:28:05,889
Holy fucking shit.

681
02:28:05,889 --> 02:28:08,379
What a disaster.

682
02:28:08,379 --> 02:28:09,379
What was that?

683
02:28:09,379 --> 02:28:14,379
I meant to say Merry Christmas to all and to all have a very good evening

684
02:28:14,379 --> 02:28:18,379
and to all good night and Merry Christmas to you.

685
02:28:18,379 --> 02:28:23,379
And to all a good night.

686
02:28:23,379 --> 02:28:24,379
Wow.

687
02:28:24,379 --> 02:28:30,870
Are we on the channel?

688
02:28:30,870 --> 02:28:32,870
Are we on my channel now?

689
02:28:32,870 --> 02:28:35,069
Are we good?

690
02:28:35,069 --> 02:28:38,870
All right.

691
02:28:38,870 --> 02:28:42,870
So sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but sometimes it takes the spirit of Christmas.

692
02:28:42,870 --> 02:28:47,870
Sometimes it takes Santa Claus to come out and right the wrongs.

693
02:28:47,870 --> 02:28:50,180
Ladies and gentlemen, we are not done.

694
02:28:50,180 --> 02:28:52,479
We are now on the channel.

695
02:28:52,479 --> 02:28:54,479
We have control.

696
02:28:54,479 --> 02:28:56,659
We're, in fact, just getting started.

697
02:28:56,659 --> 02:28:58,659
So let's go into our next category.

698
02:28:58,659 --> 02:29:02,659
This is category number 11, by the way.

699
02:29:02,659 --> 02:29:04,659
There are a lot more to do.

700
02:29:04,659 --> 02:29:06,659
So this is best rant.

701
02:29:06,659 --> 02:29:08,659
And there's some spillage here.

702
02:29:08,659 --> 02:29:15,659
And I'm going to need production to maybe help me eventually after this category.

703
02:29:15,659 --> 02:29:16,659
Right.

704
02:29:16,659 --> 02:29:18,659
I'm not going to say any bad words.

705
02:29:18,659 --> 02:29:20,659
I'm not going to yell at anybody.

706
02:29:20,659 --> 02:29:21,659
Production.

707
02:29:21,659 --> 02:29:28,659
I spilled some cocoa earlier and I may need a little bit of help to clean it up.

708
02:29:28,659 --> 02:29:30,659
How's that sound?

709
02:29:30,659 --> 02:29:31,659
There we are.

710
02:29:31,659 --> 02:29:33,659
All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's do this category.

711
02:29:33,659 --> 02:29:35,659
This is best rant of the year.

712
02:29:35,659 --> 02:29:36,659
Here are your nominees.

713
02:29:36,659 --> 02:29:39,659
Thank you, Santa, for fixing everything.

714
02:29:39,659 --> 02:29:49,639
I get exhausted.

715
02:29:49,639 --> 02:29:51,639
My brain goes like, all right, man, that's enough.

716
02:29:51,639 --> 02:29:53,639
No humans are supposed to be doing this.

717
02:29:53,639 --> 02:29:56,139
You know what fucking humans are supposed to be doing?

718
02:29:56,139 --> 02:30:07,139
Humans are supposed to be fucking picking up a wheelbarrow full of logs and just slowly walking with it and delivering those logs to the community.

719
02:30:07,139 --> 02:30:09,139
And then those logs are used to build houses.

720
02:30:09,139 --> 02:30:12,139
And then there's also a baker and a butcher.

721
02:30:13,139 --> 02:30:15,139
No humans are supposed to be doing what we're doing right now.

722
02:30:15,139 --> 02:30:17,139
Humans aren't supposed to be doing this.

723
02:30:17,139 --> 02:30:24,139
Guys, when Ben Franklin was writing up the goddamn fucking Declaration of Independence, there was no guggity guggity in there.

724
02:30:24,139 --> 02:30:25,139
There was.

725
02:30:25,139 --> 02:30:30,139
Oh, yeah, we also need to make sure to leave some room for guggity, guggity, guggity, guggity, guggity.

726
02:30:30,139 --> 02:30:32,139
There's no room for that, Ben.

727
02:30:32,139 --> 02:30:34,139
Goat cheese is so gross.

728
02:30:34,139 --> 02:30:36,139
Goat cheese is fucking vile.

729
02:30:36,139 --> 02:30:40,139
I honest to God, I feel like everybody that eats people pretend to like goat cheese.

730
02:30:40,139 --> 02:30:42,139
You pretend to like it.

731
02:30:42,139 --> 02:30:43,139
I'm so serious.

732
02:30:43,139 --> 02:30:45,139
I will die on this hill.

733
02:30:45,139 --> 02:30:47,139
Goat cheese does not taste like dirt.

734
02:30:47,139 --> 02:30:53,500
Goat cheese is this immediate, immediate, like flavor.

735
02:30:53,500 --> 02:30:56,500
It's like right when it touches your lip.

736
02:30:56,500 --> 02:30:58,500
It's just like, oh, what's on this?

737
02:30:58,500 --> 02:31:00,500
Goat cheese.

738
02:31:00,500 --> 02:31:01,500
It's immediately.

739
02:31:01,500 --> 02:31:03,500
Oh, goat cheese, bro.

740
02:31:03,500 --> 02:31:05,500
I love it.

741
02:31:05,500 --> 02:31:07,500
Oh, dude, I would eat a ton of it on a cracker.

742
02:31:07,500 --> 02:31:08,500
I love it on a cracker.

743
02:31:08,500 --> 02:31:10,500
Of course I would.

744
02:31:10,500 --> 02:31:12,500
Yeah, right.

745
02:31:12,500 --> 02:31:14,500
What if aliens don't have anything?

746
02:31:14,500 --> 02:31:21,739
Aliens could just be like, oh, wow, you have this thing over here that keeps your food from spoiling?

747
02:31:21,739 --> 02:31:29,739
Oh, on our planet, fructose, we have, um, we got stuff.

748
02:31:29,739 --> 02:31:30,739
What's that over there?

749
02:31:30,739 --> 02:31:31,739
Wait.

750
02:31:31,739 --> 02:31:32,739
Oh, it's a calendar.

751
02:31:32,739 --> 02:31:33,739
What's that?

752
02:31:33,739 --> 02:31:35,739
You keep track of days?

753
02:31:35,739 --> 02:31:36,739
Who knows, guys?

754
02:31:36,739 --> 02:31:41,739
The fact that you can have sounds come out of your mouth might be the most absurd thing that they've ever heard.

755
02:31:41,739 --> 02:31:42,739
Hi, Mr. Alien.

756
02:31:42,739 --> 02:31:46,739
How are you?

757
02:31:46,739 --> 02:31:48,739
Their heads are going to explode.

758
02:31:48,739 --> 02:31:50,739
Exactly what I told you was going to happen.

759
02:31:50,739 --> 02:31:53,010
What?

760
02:31:53,010 --> 02:31:56,020
What is this?

761
02:31:56,020 --> 02:31:57,020
What is this?

762
02:31:57,020 --> 02:31:59,020
Why does this exist?

763
02:31:59,020 --> 02:32:02,020
This is magic powers.

764
02:32:02,020 --> 02:32:04,020
The game's fucking easy.

765
02:32:04,020 --> 02:32:05,020
It's not even a hard game.

766
02:32:05,020 --> 02:32:06,020
Instant kill moves are stupid.

767
02:32:06,020 --> 02:32:07,020
Delete them.

768
02:32:07,020 --> 02:32:08,020
Instant kill moves are fucking deleted from the game.

769
02:32:08,020 --> 02:32:10,020
Instant kill moves, you should never have put those in the game.

770
02:32:10,020 --> 02:32:11,020
They're fucking stupid.

771
02:32:11,020 --> 02:32:12,020
Nobody likes them.

772
02:32:12,020 --> 02:32:13,020
Not one person likes them.

773
02:32:13,020 --> 02:32:14,020
The health is just too low.

774
02:32:14,020 --> 02:32:16,020
He doesn't have any instant kill moves.

775
02:32:16,020 --> 02:32:17,020
Okay.

776
02:32:17,020 --> 02:32:27,450
If I chop you up in a meat grinder and the only thing that comes out and that's left of you is your eyeball, you're probably dead.

777
02:32:27,450 --> 02:32:29,450
You're probably going to...

778
02:32:29,450 --> 02:32:30,450
Not you.

779
02:32:30,450 --> 02:32:34,450
I'm just saying, like, I'm not going to put you into a meat grinder.

780
02:32:34,450 --> 02:32:36,450
I'm not going to put you into a meat grinder.

781
02:32:36,450 --> 02:32:37,450
Okay.

782
02:32:37,450 --> 02:32:39,450
We're going to take humans out of this.

783
02:32:39,450 --> 02:32:55,059
If alien glob glob glob go one fucking shoots a disintegrating ray at alien glob glow two, if there's only fucking teeth left, it's fucking you're dead.

784
02:32:55,059 --> 02:32:56,059
You're dead.

785
02:32:56,059 --> 02:33:00,680
I run my dishwasher because otherwise it'll get gross.

786
02:33:00,680 --> 02:33:04,110
I wash by hand.

787
02:33:04,110 --> 02:33:06,420
I don't like that idea.

788
02:33:06,420 --> 02:33:07,420
Oh, yeah.

789
02:33:07,420 --> 02:33:10,420
It's like a bunch of fucking like salsa and like mess on my plate.

790
02:33:10,420 --> 02:33:12,420
Just stick it in here and turn the water on.

791
02:33:12,420 --> 02:33:15,170
No, I don't like the dishwasher.

792
02:33:15,170 --> 02:33:16,170
I don't like it.

793
02:33:16,170 --> 02:33:18,170
And you know, I also I don't like the dishwasher.

794
02:33:18,170 --> 02:33:20,409
All the people question marking me right now.

795
02:33:20,409 --> 02:33:24,409
So you enjoy putting like your dishes in this thing.

796
02:33:24,409 --> 02:33:38,319
And then, like, for like at least one to two fucking hours, you hear it's fucking obnoxious.

797
02:33:38,319 --> 02:33:39,319
It's obnoxious.

798
02:33:39,319 --> 02:33:43,319
And it lasts for an hour, an hour, two fucking hours of this.

799
02:33:43,319 --> 02:33:44,319
Twenty three.

800
02:33:44,319 --> 02:33:47,319
There are more hungry animals back there, Freddy.

801
02:33:47,319 --> 02:33:48,319
And that scary number.

802
02:33:48,319 --> 02:33:49,319
I like that number.

803
02:33:49,319 --> 02:33:50,319
Twenty three.

804
02:33:50,319 --> 02:33:51,319
Hold on.

805
02:33:51,319 --> 02:33:54,319
This scary thriller Jim Carrey movie.

806
02:33:54,319 --> 02:34:00,319
The number twenty three is not based on any actual real like folklore.

807
02:34:00,319 --> 02:34:02,319
I am not fucking around.

808
02:34:02,319 --> 02:34:04,319
I'm telling you the absolute honest to God truth.

809
02:34:04,319 --> 02:34:06,319
I've been afraid of that number since I've heard that movie.

810
02:34:07,319 --> 02:34:12,319
I don't know how old was I when we come out like 20 fucking years ago.

811
02:34:12,319 --> 02:34:13,319
How old was I?

812
02:34:13,319 --> 02:34:15,319
And I was probably like, I don't know.

813
02:34:15,319 --> 02:34:17,319
I don't know how old I was.

814
02:34:17,319 --> 02:34:18,319
I probably was very influenced.

815
02:34:18,319 --> 02:34:21,319
You were twenty three.

816
02:34:21,319 --> 02:34:25,440
What?

817
02:34:25,440 --> 02:34:27,440
Two divided by three is six, six, six.

818
02:34:27,440 --> 02:34:28,440
That's what I'm saying, sir.

819
02:34:28,440 --> 02:34:30,440
What do you mean question marks?

820
02:34:30,440 --> 02:34:35,129
Yeah, it's actually biblically accurate, scary number.

821
02:34:35,129 --> 02:34:39,200
I don't want the afterlife to be like this.

822
02:34:39,200 --> 02:34:40,200
Every time people think of the afterlife.

823
02:34:40,200 --> 02:34:41,200
Oh, heaven.

824
02:34:41,200 --> 02:34:42,200
Oh, my God.

825
02:34:42,200 --> 02:34:43,200
I'm moving on.

826
02:34:43,200 --> 02:34:46,889
They're floating as a specter.

827
02:34:46,889 --> 02:34:47,889
Oh, wow.

828
02:34:47,889 --> 02:34:48,889
Look at it.

829
02:34:48,889 --> 02:34:49,889
So Liz was missed everywhere.

830
02:34:49,889 --> 02:34:50,889
Everything's misty.

831
02:34:50,889 --> 02:34:51,889
And you're what?

832
02:34:51,889 --> 02:34:52,889
No, I don't want to be like this.

833
02:34:52,889 --> 02:34:57,450
I don't want to meet the caveman ancestor.

834
02:34:57,450 --> 02:35:00,579
They're all going to be there.

835
02:35:00,579 --> 02:35:09,889
I think we all think of like, oh, grandpa and grandpa and UGA and UGA is going to be there.

836
02:35:09,889 --> 02:35:10,889
I don't want to go to hell either.

837
02:35:10,889 --> 02:35:11,889
Because guess what?

838
02:35:11,889 --> 02:35:16,319
You know, there's going to be somebody there that's going to be like, yeah, yeah, it's

839
02:35:16,319 --> 02:35:17,319
fine.

840
02:35:17,319 --> 02:35:18,319
Everything, man.

841
02:35:18,319 --> 02:35:19,319
I'm glad to be down here.

842
02:35:19,319 --> 02:35:24,319
It's like I don't want to be with the one like distant great, great, great uncle that

843
02:35:24,319 --> 02:35:26,319
went to hell and hang out with him every day.

844
02:35:26,319 --> 02:35:28,319
Oh, that's going to be fun.

845
02:35:28,319 --> 02:35:31,879
Guys, why is there?

846
02:35:31,879 --> 02:35:34,879
Why is there not an option?

847
02:35:34,879 --> 02:35:35,879
Should I even do this?

848
02:35:35,879 --> 02:35:37,879
I feel like everyone's waiting for me to do this.

849
02:35:37,879 --> 02:35:39,879
OK, I'll do it in one sentence.

850
02:35:39,879 --> 02:35:41,879
Instead of like 25 sentences.

851
02:35:41,879 --> 02:35:45,879
So we're going to do that in one sentence instead of doing a 25 sentence explanation

852
02:35:45,879 --> 02:35:46,879
of what I mean by this.

853
02:35:46,879 --> 02:35:52,879
There is no add to cart option when you're trying to buy shit on Origin for the Sims.

854
02:35:52,879 --> 02:35:55,879
There's like a hundred things to buy individually.

855
02:35:55,879 --> 02:35:57,879
I got texted by my bank.

856
02:35:57,879 --> 02:35:58,879
Hey, we've declined purchases.

857
02:35:58,879 --> 02:36:02,879
There's like all these fraudulent purchases going through the EA store.

858
02:36:02,879 --> 02:36:03,879
Like, no, that's me.

859
02:36:03,879 --> 02:36:08,879
If that's me and it's dumb, you have to go through the checkout process on each individual

860
02:36:08,879 --> 02:36:10,879
Oh, one sentence.

861
02:36:10,879 --> 02:36:12,879
Shit.

862
02:36:12,879 --> 02:36:14,879
I'm sorry.

863
02:36:14,879 --> 02:36:26,719
I tend to go off the rails and that's not I don't know.

864
02:36:26,719 --> 02:36:32,719
I just I get on a topic and I just don't stop and people clip it and then they send it away.

865
02:36:32,719 --> 02:36:43,149
So, ladies and gentlemen, your winner for the best rant of 2022 is it wasn't even close

866
02:36:43,149 --> 02:36:51,860
It wasn't even close at fifty four point seven percent.

867
02:36:51,860 --> 02:36:58,030
Fifty five percent is the meat grinder, the meat grinder.

868
02:36:58,030 --> 02:37:01,030
And then humans are not supposed to be doing this at seventeen point six.

869
02:37:01,030 --> 02:37:04,030
Alien panic at nine point one.

870
02:37:04,030 --> 02:37:06,270
It wasn't even close.

871
02:37:06,270 --> 02:37:08,409
Look at the meat.

872
02:37:08,409 --> 02:37:11,409
OK, let me let me defend myself.

873
02:37:11,409 --> 02:37:19,030
The meat grinder category or the meat grinder rant was one person said something

874
02:37:19,030 --> 02:37:22,030
and I was pretending like they were.

875
02:37:22,030 --> 02:37:24,030
It's a made up person.

876
02:37:24,030 --> 02:37:26,030
Right. This person doesn't exist.

877
02:37:26,030 --> 02:37:31,030
When I say you, I'm talking about you in general, not you watching right now.

878
02:37:31,030 --> 02:37:34,030
You in general, you in general.

879
02:37:34,030 --> 02:37:36,030
It's not.

880
02:37:36,030 --> 02:37:38,030
Oh, I'm going to put you in a meat now.

881
02:37:38,030 --> 02:37:40,030
I'm not going to clip that, too.

882
02:37:40,030 --> 02:37:42,030
So I'm going to stop talking.

883
02:37:42,030 --> 02:37:45,270
When I say you, I mean just you in general, just you.

884
02:37:45,270 --> 02:37:48,270
Oh, you know, if I put you into a meat grinder, I'm not saying you.

885
02:37:48,270 --> 02:37:50,270
You get it. You understand.

886
02:37:50,270 --> 02:37:52,639
Moving right along.

887
02:37:52,639 --> 02:37:55,260
Now, here come the juicy ones.

888
02:37:55,260 --> 02:37:58,530
These are the juicy ones.

889
02:37:58,530 --> 02:37:59,530
There's so many categories left.

890
02:37:59,530 --> 02:38:01,959
We just got started.

891
02:38:01,959 --> 02:38:06,780
I tend to do impressions and some of them are very good.

892
02:38:06,780 --> 02:38:07,780
Some of them are very bad.

893
02:38:07,780 --> 02:38:09,780
I think some of my impressions are good.

894
02:38:09,780 --> 02:38:11,780
Although people would tell me to do your impressions.

895
02:38:11,780 --> 02:38:13,780
Your impressions are terrible.

896
02:38:13,780 --> 02:38:15,780
So we'll start with the best.

897
02:38:15,780 --> 02:38:16,780
We'll go to the worst after.

898
02:38:16,780 --> 02:38:19,780
This is the best impressions.

899
02:38:19,780 --> 02:38:23,399
I think I did a pretty good job this year.

900
02:38:23,399 --> 02:38:27,280
I mean, people are doing that emote and I can see it.

901
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:28,280
They're like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

902
02:38:28,280 --> 02:38:29,280
My head's bobbing around.

903
02:38:29,280 --> 02:38:30,280
Whatever.

904
02:38:30,280 --> 02:38:33,280
You guys know what I mean when I say that shit though, right?

905
02:38:33,280 --> 02:38:34,280
You have to.

906
02:38:34,280 --> 02:38:36,520
I told Santa I wouldn't swear.

907
02:38:36,520 --> 02:38:39,520
So I'm going to say, what the shoot.

908
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:43,819
So here are your nominees for best impression of the year.

909
02:38:43,819 --> 02:38:45,819
These are the good ones.

910
02:38:45,819 --> 02:38:53,489
At least I hope they are.

911
02:38:53,489 --> 02:38:59,489
Now make haste to the tower and defeat the evil wizards.

912
02:38:59,489 --> 02:39:01,489
Mermaid man.

913
02:39:01,489 --> 02:39:05,489
Evil wizards.

914
02:39:05,489 --> 02:39:11,489
Now we need to get into the boat and go get them, SpongeBob.

915
02:39:11,489 --> 02:39:15,329
What are you doing, you old moron?

916
02:39:15,329 --> 02:39:22,500
I am trying to do what it is a superhero must be doing.

917
02:39:22,500 --> 02:39:24,500
Getting to the bank.

918
02:39:24,500 --> 02:39:28,500
And who could forget Sir Gideon Ofnir?

919
02:39:28,500 --> 02:39:31,500
The all-knowing.

920
02:39:31,500 --> 02:39:32,500
There he is.

921
02:39:32,500 --> 02:39:33,870
You drink?

922
02:39:33,870 --> 02:39:41,540
Or I'm blue.

923
02:39:41,540 --> 02:39:43,540
Chief of the Badlands.

924
02:39:43,540 --> 02:39:46,899
The ever-knowing gold man.

925
02:39:46,899 --> 02:39:51,850
The disgusting dung eater.

926
02:39:51,850 --> 02:39:57,280
And of course, Sir Gideon Ofnir.

927
02:39:57,280 --> 02:39:59,280
The all-knowing.

928
02:39:59,280 --> 02:40:01,280
What's happening, my friend?

929
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:03,280
I would have voted for that one.

930
02:40:03,280 --> 02:40:04,280
Meat.

931
02:40:04,280 --> 02:40:06,280
Potatoes.

932
02:40:06,280 --> 02:40:13,299
And lettuce and fucking gravy.

933
02:40:13,299 --> 02:40:14,299
Spinach.

934
02:40:14,299 --> 02:40:18,379
And radishes.

935
02:40:18,379 --> 02:40:19,379
And I'm alive.

936
02:40:19,379 --> 02:40:20,379
And I'm human.

937
02:40:20,379 --> 02:40:22,870
I like to eat, too.

938
02:40:22,870 --> 02:40:25,430
And I like to have children.

939
02:40:25,430 --> 02:40:26,430
I'm here.

940
02:40:26,430 --> 02:40:28,430
And I'm coming.

941
02:40:28,430 --> 02:40:29,430
I'm here.

942
02:40:29,430 --> 02:40:30,430
And I'm coming.

943
02:40:30,430 --> 02:40:32,670
It's like, oh, Patty the Platypus.

944
02:40:32,670 --> 02:40:35,670
I'm going to take over the entire world, Patty.

945
02:40:35,670 --> 02:40:36,670
No, it's me, Doofus.

946
02:40:36,670 --> 02:40:38,670
But that was actually really, really good.

947
02:40:38,670 --> 02:40:40,670
And I would say that was probably the best one

948
02:40:40,670 --> 02:40:41,670
you've heard anybody do.

949
02:40:41,670 --> 02:40:43,670
Not showing anything under arrest.

950
02:40:43,670 --> 02:40:45,670
I'm underwater.

951
02:40:45,670 --> 02:40:53,559
Gentlemen, this is tobacco receive manifest.

952
02:40:53,559 --> 02:40:54,559
Same voice.

953
02:40:54,559 --> 02:40:56,559
Ever look at that headlock there, see?

954
02:40:56,559 --> 02:40:58,559
That chap over there joined.

955
02:40:58,559 --> 02:40:59,559
Or by pay us this.

956
02:40:59,559 --> 02:41:00,559
Same voice.

957
02:41:00,559 --> 02:41:02,559
Is the local got me on the penis before.

958
02:41:02,559 --> 02:41:03,559
He has one voice.

959
02:41:04,559 --> 02:41:23,430
Tom Scott, this water is electrified.

960
02:41:23,430 --> 02:41:27,430
It will kill you if you stand within five feet of it.

961
02:41:27,430 --> 02:41:28,610
Yahoo.

962
02:41:28,610 --> 02:41:29,610
Yahoo.

963
02:41:29,610 --> 02:41:31,360
Whoa.

964
02:41:31,360 --> 02:41:32,360
Oh, Bowser.

965
02:41:32,360 --> 02:41:35,649
Ah, annoying.

966
02:41:35,649 --> 02:41:40,889
Oh, boys and girls, it's a me, Mario.

967
02:41:40,889 --> 02:41:43,260
Let me tell you something.

968
02:41:43,260 --> 02:41:48,260
If somebody want to tell you to take drugs, always say no.

969
02:41:48,260 --> 02:41:52,260
You say, Luigi, try to drink and do drugs one time.

970
02:41:52,260 --> 02:41:54,260
And I said, no.

971
02:41:54,260 --> 02:41:55,260
And he said, Mario.

972
02:41:55,260 --> 02:41:57,260
And I said, no.

973
02:41:57,260 --> 02:42:00,260
So fucking god damn it.

974
02:42:06,909 --> 02:42:10,909
And that's the bottom line, because Stone Cold said so.

975
02:42:10,909 --> 02:42:11,909
Pretty good.

976
02:42:11,909 --> 02:42:13,909
They're eating her.

977
02:42:13,909 --> 02:42:15,909
And then they're going to eat me.

978
02:42:15,909 --> 02:42:21,319
Oh my god.

979
02:42:21,319 --> 02:42:26,319
Please can you do a quick Seinfeld routine about the word vast.

980
02:42:26,319 --> 02:42:29,860
What even is vast?

981
02:42:29,860 --> 02:42:31,860
What's that supposed to mean vast?

982
02:42:31,860 --> 02:42:32,860
Just say big.

983
02:42:32,860 --> 02:42:33,860
Just say large.

984
02:42:33,860 --> 02:42:35,860
Say big.

985
02:42:35,860 --> 02:42:42,620
Why do we need names for so why do we have so many names to describe what is effectively big?

986
02:42:42,620 --> 02:42:54,299
I mean, if you want you want my vote, I'm voting for Alex Jones.

987
02:42:54,299 --> 02:42:55,299
I don't think anybody does it.

988
02:42:55,299 --> 02:42:57,299
Alex Jones, like, I can't.

989
02:42:57,299 --> 02:42:59,299
I just I'm going to be really honest.

990
02:42:59,299 --> 02:43:04,420
Find me somebody that can do that as good as I can.

991
02:43:04,420 --> 02:43:05,420
People usually, you know, they go like this.

992
02:43:05,420 --> 02:43:07,420
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

993
02:43:07,420 --> 02:43:09,920
Find me somebody that can do that better than me.

994
02:43:09,920 --> 02:43:10,920
I don't think you can.

995
02:43:10,920 --> 02:43:12,159
That's my vote.

996
02:43:12,159 --> 02:43:15,229
That's what I voted for.

997
02:43:15,229 --> 02:43:24,540
But your winner of the best impression of the year is, of course, it's Alpenny the Platypus.

998
02:43:24,540 --> 02:43:26,540
Doofenshmirtz.

999
02:43:26,540 --> 02:43:29,540
With 30 percent of the vote, that's a high one.

1000
02:43:29,540 --> 02:43:31,540
Then Alex Jones right behind it.

1001
02:43:31,540 --> 02:43:32,780
Sixteen point eight.

1002
02:43:32,780 --> 02:43:33,780
Not right behind it.

1003
02:43:33,780 --> 02:43:36,280
Pretty far.

1004
02:43:36,280 --> 02:43:37,280
Doofenshmirtz.

1005
02:43:37,280 --> 02:43:38,280
Alex Jones.

1006
02:43:38,280 --> 02:43:39,280
Doofenshmirtz.

1007
02:43:39,280 --> 02:43:40,280
It's a hard word to say.

1008
02:43:40,280 --> 02:43:45,280
And then democracy manifests subtitles at 12.3 percent.

1009
02:43:45,280 --> 02:43:48,989
Doofenshmirtz takes it.

1010
02:43:48,989 --> 02:43:52,000
I think I can do a pretty good job.

1011
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:58,010
And now, obviously, I do a lot of these every year.

1012
02:43:59,440 --> 02:44:02,440
And we're not just going to talk about the good ones.

1013
02:44:02,440 --> 02:44:05,440
We're going to talk about the bad ones.

1014
02:44:05,440 --> 02:44:08,440
This is the worst impression of the year.

1015
02:44:08,440 --> 02:44:11,620
I don't agree with some of these.

1016
02:44:11,620 --> 02:44:13,620
Let's be real.

1017
02:44:13,620 --> 02:44:15,620
I don't agree with some of these.

1018
02:44:15,620 --> 02:44:19,620
Some of these are a little like, I don't like that character, so I'm just going to nominate it.

1019
02:44:19,620 --> 02:44:21,620
That's not how this works.

1020
02:44:21,620 --> 02:44:26,180
But just like the bad ones are also good ones, and what you just saw.

1021
02:44:26,180 --> 02:44:30,610
Here are your nominees for the worst impression of the entire year.

1022
02:44:30,610 --> 02:44:40,979
Did you do Jack Sparrow?

1023
02:44:42,979 --> 02:44:43,979
I'm done.

1024
02:44:43,979 --> 02:44:44,979
My career is over.

1025
02:44:44,979 --> 02:44:45,979
I'm ending my career.

1026
02:44:45,979 --> 02:44:46,979
It's over today.

1027
02:44:46,979 --> 02:44:48,979
OK, so I got a letter.

1028
02:44:48,979 --> 02:44:54,469
Jerry, when you read this letter, I will already be on the other side of the world.

1029
02:44:54,469 --> 02:44:56,469
I'm sorry about that.

1030
02:44:56,469 --> 02:44:58,469
I'm sorry that I'm not the father you wanted me to be.

1031
02:44:58,469 --> 02:45:00,469
The rest is up to you.

1032
02:45:00,469 --> 02:45:02,469
Do your best and live a wonderful life.

1033
02:45:02,469 --> 02:45:04,469
You always will.

1034
02:45:05,469 --> 02:45:07,969
That's the worst George I've ever heard.

1035
02:45:07,969 --> 02:45:09,969
It's really not. That's what I mean.

1036
02:45:09,969 --> 02:45:11,969
It's Gilbert Godfrey.

1037
02:45:11,969 --> 02:45:16,969
Hey, when I'm told, and I've been looking forward to this for quite a long time.

1038
02:45:16,969 --> 02:45:19,969
Health is more popular than ever in the Mushroom Kingdom.

1039
02:45:19,969 --> 02:45:22,969
Wasn't that tourney yesterday incredible?

1040
02:45:22,969 --> 02:45:29,860
But if we want to keep the sport interesting, we need some green players, you see.

1041
02:45:29,860 --> 02:45:32,860
And I just don't think folks can hit the green.

1042
02:45:32,860 --> 02:45:33,860
Whoa, wait.

1043
02:45:33,860 --> 02:45:34,860
That's not even that bad.

1044
02:45:34,860 --> 02:45:35,860
That's crazy.

1045
02:45:35,860 --> 02:45:37,860
That's all I had to do was just clear my throat.

1046
02:45:37,860 --> 02:45:40,860
We need some fresh faces on the leaderboard.

1047
02:45:40,860 --> 02:45:45,909
OK.

1048
02:45:45,909 --> 02:45:49,540
That was really bad.

1049
02:45:49,540 --> 02:45:51,540
I don't know if that's Toad or...

1050
02:45:51,540 --> 02:45:56,540
I don't know what game that was from, but it was a bad impression.

1051
02:45:56,540 --> 02:46:01,540
Ooh, Skywalker, I must say you are...

1052
02:46:01,540 --> 02:46:02,540
Is that bad?

1053
02:46:02,540 --> 02:46:05,540
It really was one word elongated.

1054
02:46:06,540 --> 02:46:09,540
You sound like the Swedish chef.

1055
02:46:09,540 --> 02:46:11,540
Do we have a Bobby Hill impression?

1056
02:46:11,540 --> 02:46:12,540
I'll try.

1057
02:46:12,540 --> 02:46:13,840
Yeah.

1058
02:46:13,840 --> 02:46:16,399
Hey, Dad, I'm sorry.

1059
02:46:16,399 --> 02:46:17,399
I can't.

1060
02:46:17,399 --> 02:46:18,399
But I tried.

1061
02:46:18,399 --> 02:46:20,399
What does Cookie Monster sound like?

1062
02:46:20,399 --> 02:46:23,049
It's like...

1063
02:46:23,049 --> 02:46:24,049
What does it sound like?

1064
02:46:24,049 --> 02:46:25,049
It's kind of like...

1065
02:46:25,049 --> 02:46:32,299
Cookies.

1066
02:46:32,299 --> 02:46:34,299
I love cookies, right?

1067
02:46:34,299 --> 02:46:35,299
Something like that?

1068
02:46:35,299 --> 02:46:37,299
Let me go all in with it and see what happens.

1069
02:46:37,299 --> 02:46:42,040
This cookie is delicious.

1070
02:46:42,040 --> 02:46:44,040
I love cookies.

1071
02:46:44,040 --> 02:46:46,040
It's heavy from TF2.

1072
02:46:46,040 --> 02:46:48,040
That's really not that good.

1073
02:46:48,040 --> 02:46:50,040
But, I mean, how do you even do it?

1074
02:46:50,040 --> 02:46:52,040
Let me try to do a dog.

1075
02:46:52,040 --> 02:46:55,040
Oh, Morty, we've got to be careful.

1076
02:46:55,040 --> 02:46:59,409
Put that back in there and we're going to go back in time to shave.

1077
02:46:59,409 --> 02:47:00,409
Actually, it is different.

1078
02:47:00,409 --> 02:47:03,840
Morty, Morty, we've got to be careful.

1079
02:47:03,840 --> 02:47:06,659
Guys, I've never seen all these movies.

1080
02:47:06,659 --> 02:47:07,659
I've never seen them.

1081
02:47:07,659 --> 02:47:08,659
I just know...

1082
02:47:08,659 --> 02:47:09,659
I know Christopher Lloyd.

1083
02:47:09,659 --> 02:47:10,659
Right?

1084
02:47:10,659 --> 02:47:14,620
His name's Morty, not Marty.

1085
02:47:14,620 --> 02:47:15,620
Morty, not Marty.

1086
02:47:15,620 --> 02:47:16,620
Marty, not...

1087
02:47:16,620 --> 02:47:18,620
I just dropped everything.

1088
02:47:18,620 --> 02:47:20,620
Do a Taz impression.

1089
02:47:20,620 --> 02:47:23,950
Not on a sponsor stream.

1090
02:47:23,950 --> 02:47:24,950
Whatever.

1091
02:47:24,950 --> 02:47:34,469
Why not?

1092
02:47:34,469 --> 02:47:40,700
I was just about...

1093
02:47:40,700 --> 02:47:41,700
Okay.

1094
02:47:41,700 --> 02:47:44,700
Taz Mania was just about to do that.

1095
02:47:44,700 --> 02:47:51,440
Somebody hitman style, put a fucking piano wire on his neck.

1096
02:47:51,440 --> 02:47:52,440
Patrick?

1097
02:47:52,440 --> 02:47:55,020
Hey, SpongeBob.

1098
02:47:55,020 --> 02:47:57,709
It's me, Patrick.

1099
02:47:57,709 --> 02:47:58,709
Oh, yeah.

1100
02:47:58,709 --> 02:48:00,709
SpongeBob, let's go have an adventure.

1101
02:48:00,709 --> 02:48:02,709
What was wrong with this one?

1102
02:48:02,709 --> 02:48:03,709
Does that sound like I'm kind of...

1103
02:48:03,709 --> 02:48:04,709
Yeah, it does.

1104
02:48:04,709 --> 02:48:08,170
Why was this on here?

1105
02:48:08,170 --> 02:48:09,170
Enjoy yourself.

1106
02:48:09,170 --> 02:48:10,170
Nope.

1107
02:48:10,170 --> 02:48:14,340
This is why it's a strange world.

1108
02:48:14,340 --> 02:48:19,340
This realm has a way of getting right into your heart.

1109
02:48:19,340 --> 02:48:21,340
And if that book becomes way more...

1110
02:48:21,340 --> 02:48:22,340
This one sucks.

1111
02:48:22,340 --> 02:48:23,340
This one sucks.

1112
02:48:23,340 --> 02:48:24,340
I like it.

1113
02:48:24,340 --> 02:48:25,340
This is bad.

1114
02:48:25,340 --> 02:48:29,340
I will be expecting a very great thing from you.

1115
02:48:29,340 --> 02:48:34,340
It will get hotter in which you might not be able to imagine.

1116
02:48:34,340 --> 02:48:36,340
Geez, this one's the worst.

1117
02:48:36,340 --> 02:48:37,340
Does this win?

1118
02:48:37,340 --> 02:48:39,219
Voice is bad.

1119
02:48:39,219 --> 02:48:40,219
Voice is bad.

1120
02:48:40,219 --> 02:48:41,219
Shitty voice.

1121
02:48:41,219 --> 02:48:42,219
Worst voice.

1122
02:48:42,219 --> 02:48:47,500
Does that win?

1123
02:48:47,500 --> 02:48:49,500
You want my vote.

1124
02:48:49,500 --> 02:48:50,500
It's that one.

1125
02:48:50,500 --> 02:48:52,250
Look.

1126
02:48:52,250 --> 02:48:53,489
Okay.

1127
02:48:53,489 --> 02:48:54,489
You have to...

1128
02:48:54,489 --> 02:48:55,489
I am live.

1129
02:48:55,489 --> 02:48:58,860
I don't know how many hours a year.

1130
02:48:58,860 --> 02:49:02,860
But if I'm going to do an impression, sometimes you get shitty ones.

1131
02:49:02,860 --> 02:49:03,860
Sometimes you get duds.

1132
02:49:03,860 --> 02:49:06,860
I don't think the George was bad.

1133
02:49:06,860 --> 02:49:08,860
Why that George Costanza was so bad?

1134
02:49:08,860 --> 02:49:09,860
Jerry!

1135
02:49:09,860 --> 02:49:10,860
How?

1136
02:49:10,860 --> 02:49:13,860
Why would that be nominated that many times?

1137
02:49:13,860 --> 02:49:15,860
I think that one was fine.

1138
02:49:15,860 --> 02:49:18,180
Why was that so bad?

1139
02:49:18,180 --> 02:49:19,360
Question marks.

1140
02:49:19,360 --> 02:49:20,360
That sucked.

1141
02:49:20,360 --> 02:49:22,600
Was it that bad?

1142
02:49:22,600 --> 02:49:23,600
I don't think it was.

1143
02:49:23,600 --> 02:49:25,600
I think you're mistaken here.

1144
02:49:25,600 --> 02:49:27,479
They were all bad.

1145
02:49:27,479 --> 02:49:28,479
The frog one definitely won.

1146
02:49:28,479 --> 02:49:30,479
If it didn't, then there's something wrong with this community.

1147
02:49:31,479 --> 02:49:36,479
Ladies and gentlemen, your winner of worst impression of the entire year is...

1148
02:49:36,479 --> 02:49:39,479
What the fuck?

1149
02:49:39,479 --> 02:49:42,040
It's not even in the top three.

1150
02:49:42,040 --> 02:49:47,219
Toad was 23.2% of the vote.

1151
02:49:47,219 --> 02:49:50,219
And then Jack Sparrow at 18.9.

1152
02:49:50,219 --> 02:49:54,100
And then Patrick Starr at 10.9%.

1153
02:49:54,100 --> 02:49:56,100
One, two, and three.

1154
02:49:56,100 --> 02:49:57,100
What?

1155
02:49:57,100 --> 02:50:00,680
That frog was so bad.

1156
02:50:00,680 --> 02:50:04,750
Why is that not at like 80% of the vote?

1157
02:50:04,750 --> 02:50:06,750
All right.

1158
02:50:06,750 --> 02:50:09,500
Time for the meaty categories.

1159
02:50:09,500 --> 02:50:12,870
These are the ones that are full of flavor.

1160
02:50:12,870 --> 02:50:17,370
I'm going to take my time with these because this is my ego stroke here.

1161
02:50:17,370 --> 02:50:20,180
It's time for an ego stroke.

1162
02:50:20,180 --> 02:50:22,180
Until this one.

1163
02:50:22,180 --> 02:50:24,319
But, you know.

1164
02:50:24,319 --> 02:50:30,500
This next category is one that hits very deep to me and probably to those of you watching.

1165
02:50:30,500 --> 02:50:34,500
This is for the best joke taking more than five minutes to set up.

1166
02:50:34,500 --> 02:50:41,500
And what that means is that anything that took at least a few minutes to get rolling.

1167
02:50:41,500 --> 02:50:42,500
Okay?

1168
02:50:42,500 --> 02:50:44,500
At least a few minutes to get rolling.

1169
02:50:44,500 --> 02:50:48,500
So there were a lot of nominees, a lot of good ones, that I think.

1170
02:50:48,500 --> 02:50:49,500
And you're swearing.

1171
02:50:49,500 --> 02:50:52,500
Santa is already across the globe right now.

1172
02:50:52,500 --> 02:50:53,500
He's a very busy person.

1173
02:50:53,500 --> 02:50:55,500
So he's a very busy man.

1174
02:50:55,500 --> 02:51:04,180
Ladies and gentlemen, here are your nominees for the best joke of the year taking more than five minutes to set up.

1175
02:51:04,180 --> 02:51:07,770
Toad wasn't even bad. Stop.

1176
02:51:07,770 --> 02:51:13,719
Don't you think that would add some atmosphere?

1177
02:51:13,719 --> 02:51:18,719
If like after every major kind of area, every puzzle was like music played and you just heard.

1178
02:51:18,719 --> 02:51:19,719
Scorn.

1179
02:51:19,719 --> 02:51:21,540
That'd be kind of cool.

1180
02:51:21,540 --> 02:51:23,540
Jesus.

1181
02:51:23,540 --> 02:51:25,540
Oh, what the fuck?

1182
02:51:25,540 --> 02:51:27,540
Scorn.

1183
02:51:27,540 --> 02:51:28,540
Blood.

1184
02:51:28,540 --> 02:51:31,100
Lots of fucking blood.

1185
02:51:31,100 --> 02:51:32,100
Lots of blood.

1186
02:51:32,100 --> 02:51:33,100
That's a lot of blood.

1187
02:51:33,100 --> 02:51:35,780
Scorn.

1188
02:51:35,780 --> 02:51:37,780
I have to be better at fucking acting.

1189
02:51:37,780 --> 02:51:39,149
True.

1190
02:51:39,149 --> 02:51:42,760
Scorn.

1191
02:51:42,760 --> 02:51:45,760
I'm sorry.

1192
02:51:45,760 --> 02:51:53,180
I can't do it.

1193
02:51:53,180 --> 02:51:55,700
I don't know.

1194
02:51:55,700 --> 02:51:57,700
I look like a different person.

1195
02:51:57,700 --> 02:51:58,700
Leave it on.

1196
02:51:58,700 --> 02:52:01,069
So the twitch thumbnail gets it.

1197
02:52:01,069 --> 02:52:02,069
All right.

1198
02:52:02,069 --> 02:52:03,069
Fine.

1199
02:52:03,069 --> 02:52:04,069
Make this the thumbnail.

1200
02:52:04,069 --> 02:52:05,069
No, dude.

1201
02:52:05,069 --> 02:52:09,489
I.

1202
02:52:09,489 --> 02:52:11,489
This is fucking insane.

1203
02:52:11,489 --> 02:52:13,489
I think we're going a little too far.

1204
02:52:13,489 --> 02:52:14,489
I think we're going too far.

1205
02:52:14,489 --> 02:52:15,489
OK.

1206
02:52:15,489 --> 02:52:18,489
Are you ready for the culmination of what is the thumbnail right now?

1207
02:52:18,489 --> 02:52:20,049
Here you go.

1208
02:52:20,049 --> 02:52:24,379
Welcome to hell.

1209
02:52:24,379 --> 02:52:28,420
Now, listen, Buster.

1210
02:52:28,420 --> 02:52:35,549
Once we get down here, I'm going to make sure that we take care of this as soon as possible.

1211
02:52:35,549 --> 02:52:40,110
Now, I don't get that move at all.

1212
02:52:40,110 --> 02:52:43,110
That move is absolutely unbelievable.

1213
02:52:43,110 --> 02:52:45,110
It's one of those moves that you can't do anything about.

1214
02:52:45,110 --> 02:52:50,620
And I'm telling you, yeah, as ridiculous as that, get playing soon.

1215
02:52:50,620 --> 02:52:53,620
They're going to be like I can fly eventually, too.

1216
02:52:53,620 --> 02:52:57,110
How many fucking moves do you get before you?

1217
02:52:57,110 --> 02:52:58,110
I'm sorry about that, folks.

1218
02:52:58,110 --> 02:53:01,110
But I meant to say was how many moves do you get to do in a row before?

1219
02:53:01,110 --> 02:53:02,110
Gosh darn it.

1220
02:53:02,110 --> 02:53:03,110
You.

1221
02:53:03,110 --> 02:53:04,110
How many moves do you do?

1222
02:53:04,110 --> 02:53:05,110
Gosh darn it.

1223
02:53:05,110 --> 02:53:07,110
Or fucking wrong thing.

1224
02:53:07,110 --> 02:53:08,110
Wrong thing.

1225
02:53:08,110 --> 02:53:09,110
All right.

1226
02:53:09,110 --> 02:53:11,180
Here we go.

1227
02:53:11,180 --> 02:53:12,180
I made the medic.

1228
02:53:12,180 --> 02:53:13,180
I'm good to go.

1229
02:53:13,180 --> 02:53:26,020
I'm going to be killing these people.

1230
02:53:26,020 --> 02:53:38,909
I'm not eating bugs.

1231
02:53:38,909 --> 02:53:42,909
I wouldn't eat bugs if my if like my mother asked me to.

1232
02:53:42,909 --> 02:53:43,909
What about a doctor?

1233
02:53:43,909 --> 02:53:44,909
I don't know.

1234
02:53:44,909 --> 02:53:45,909
What does the doctor look like?

1235
02:53:45,909 --> 02:53:50,299
Is he like six feet tall?

1236
02:53:50,299 --> 02:53:51,299
Like 200?

1237
02:53:51,299 --> 02:53:52,299
Lean cut?

1238
02:53:52,299 --> 02:53:53,299
What does he look like?

1239
02:53:53,299 --> 02:53:54,299
And he is so fit.

1240
02:53:54,299 --> 02:53:59,299
He just got done cycling and he's got cycling shorts on and a lab coat.

1241
02:53:59,299 --> 02:54:02,299
Stop sharing your fantasy.

1242
02:54:02,299 --> 02:54:07,479
Just got just got done with a quick bike ride.

1243
02:54:07,479 --> 02:54:09,479
Kickstand comes in.

1244
02:54:09,479 --> 02:54:13,479
It's like sweat just glistening off his forehead.

1245
02:54:13,479 --> 02:54:16,479
So what brings you in today?

1246
02:54:16,479 --> 02:54:18,719
And I'm like, oh, wow, look at that.

1247
02:54:18,719 --> 02:54:19,719
That's why you got that.

1248
02:54:19,719 --> 02:54:20,719
What a head of hair.

1249
02:54:20,719 --> 02:54:21,719
Yeah.

1250
02:54:21,719 --> 02:54:24,719
I haven't had a headache, by the way, in a long time.

1251
02:54:24,719 --> 02:54:25,719
Different music.

1252
02:54:25,719 --> 02:54:32,440
You want to eat some bugs?

1253
02:54:32,440 --> 02:54:40,020
We're watching you in a bar, Jerma, do something wacky.

1254
02:54:40,020 --> 02:54:41,020
I like this one.

1255
02:54:41,020 --> 02:54:42,379
Hey, this one.

1256
02:54:42,379 --> 02:54:47,100
This one goes out to this one goes out to all y'all in the bar.

1257
02:54:47,100 --> 02:54:51,639
Hey, three, two, one.

1258
02:54:51,639 --> 02:54:52,639
Let's go.

1259
02:54:52,639 --> 02:54:53,639
Mmm.

1260
02:54:53,639 --> 02:54:57,889
Green tea.

1261
02:54:57,889 --> 02:54:59,889
They can't even hear me.

1262
02:54:59,889 --> 02:55:02,510
Should I try to communicate?

1263
02:55:02,510 --> 02:55:03,510
Hey.

1264
02:55:03,510 --> 02:55:04,510
You wait.

1265
02:55:04,510 --> 02:55:05,510
Look.

1266
02:55:05,510 --> 02:55:06,510
Hey, everybody.

1267
02:55:06,510 --> 02:55:15,170
Hey, I was on screen at a bar for those of you back there that don't know what's going

1268
02:55:15,170 --> 02:55:16,409
on.

1269
02:55:16,409 --> 02:55:17,840
Right.

1270
02:55:17,840 --> 02:55:18,840
I was typing and shit.

1271
02:55:18,840 --> 02:55:21,420
Yeah.

1272
02:55:21,420 --> 02:55:24,920
What about a Twitch moment badge for longest stream?

1273
02:55:24,920 --> 02:55:27,670
Wait, can I do that?

1274
02:55:27,670 --> 02:55:32,670
You were here for the longest stream I've ever done on this channel.

1275
02:55:32,670 --> 02:55:36,670
13 hours, 19 minutes and 41 seconds.

1276
02:55:36,670 --> 02:55:39,549
Ain't ever going to happen again.

1277
02:55:39,549 --> 02:55:40,549
Do I do another moment?

1278
02:55:40,549 --> 02:55:41,549
It's not ever.

1279
02:55:41,549 --> 02:55:48,569
Like the 200 people that just left.

1280
02:55:48,569 --> 02:55:49,569
You fucked up.

1281
02:55:49,569 --> 02:55:53,569
13 hours, 27 minutes and six seconds.

1282
02:55:53,569 --> 02:55:58,639
I think that deserves a quick bite of pizza.

1283
02:55:58,639 --> 02:55:59,639
Hey, man.

1284
02:55:59,639 --> 02:56:02,069
I can't believe you made it.

1285
02:56:02,069 --> 02:56:03,069
Was I on drugs?

1286
02:56:03,069 --> 02:56:04,069
Like what was I doing?

1287
02:56:04,069 --> 02:56:07,069
13 hours, 36 minutes and 52 seconds.

1288
02:56:07,069 --> 02:56:08,069
God, man.

1289
02:56:08,069 --> 02:56:09,069
I can't believe you were here.

1290
02:56:09,069 --> 02:56:12,069
Don't ever call the sus guy at 3am.

1291
02:56:12,069 --> 02:56:19,780
Hey, dude, can you speak up?

1292
02:56:19,780 --> 02:56:20,780
I'm in a construction site.

1293
02:56:21,780 --> 02:56:23,270
I would vote for this one.

1294
02:56:23,270 --> 02:56:24,270
I love this one.

1295
02:56:29,010 --> 02:56:30,010
Okay.

1296
02:56:35,260 --> 02:56:36,260
Why would you even go live?

1297
02:56:36,260 --> 02:56:37,750
Just wait till tomorrow.

1298
02:56:37,750 --> 02:56:38,750
Like who cares?

1299
02:56:38,750 --> 02:56:40,750
Fucking keep your stream off.

1300
02:56:40,750 --> 02:57:02,979
Okay.

1301
02:57:06,629 --> 02:57:07,629
What the fuck?

1302
02:57:07,629 --> 02:57:10,190
What am I supposed to do?

1303
02:57:10,190 --> 02:57:12,190
Guys, what does that mean?

1304
02:57:12,190 --> 02:57:13,190
Whoa.

1305
02:57:13,190 --> 02:57:14,750
A guy.

1306
02:57:14,750 --> 02:57:15,750
Hold on.

1307
02:57:15,750 --> 02:57:17,440
Watch out.

1308
02:57:17,440 --> 02:57:18,440
I got it.

1309
02:57:18,440 --> 02:57:22,239
I got it.

1310
02:57:22,239 --> 02:57:23,239
I got it.

1311
02:57:23,239 --> 02:57:24,239
Got to get this kill.

1312
02:57:24,239 --> 02:57:25,239
Got to get this kill.

1313
02:57:25,239 --> 02:57:27,239
Oh, I died.

1314
02:57:27,239 --> 02:57:29,700
Shoot.

1315
02:57:29,700 --> 02:57:32,700
What if I just like pretended to fall asleep on stream?

1316
02:57:35,700 --> 02:57:36,700
All right.

1317
02:57:36,700 --> 02:57:37,700
I'm going to pretend to fall asleep on stream.

1318
02:57:37,700 --> 02:57:38,700
I think this is both categories.

1319
02:57:38,700 --> 02:57:40,700
Like, dude, wicked fucking tired.

1320
02:57:40,700 --> 02:57:41,700
I had a long day.

1321
02:57:41,700 --> 02:57:43,700
I hope it wins both.

1322
02:57:43,700 --> 02:57:46,700
And then you're woken up by the jump scare.

1323
02:58:00,659 --> 02:58:06,700
Fuck.

1324
02:58:06,700 --> 02:58:08,000
Yeah.

1325
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:11,000
So speaking of which, I am a new man.

1326
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:15,000
I'm here to do something that I said that I would never do.

1327
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:17,000
And that's to play Destiny 2.

1328
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:19,000
I love this part when he says the doctor.

1329
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:20,000
I know.

1330
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:21,000
I said I'd never do it.

1331
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:22,000
But here we are.

1332
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:23,000
Shpee.

1333
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:25,299
That's the Shpee ship.

1334
02:58:25,299 --> 02:58:28,299
We're taking the Shpee ship to war.

1335
02:58:28,299 --> 02:58:30,299
You're fucked.

1336
02:58:30,299 --> 02:58:34,299
You took everything from me even though it's really not that bad.

1337
02:58:34,299 --> 02:58:37,299
And I'm going to punch you the first few times.

1338
02:58:37,299 --> 02:58:38,299
You better run.

1339
02:58:38,299 --> 02:58:40,299
And you better never look back.

1340
02:58:40,299 --> 02:58:42,299
Is this Scooby Doo, man?

1341
02:58:42,299 --> 02:58:46,889
Is this the mystery machine?

1342
02:58:46,889 --> 02:58:57,510
It's too dark.

1343
02:59:09,629 --> 02:59:26,040
Well, that was quite a year.

1344
02:59:26,040 --> 02:59:32,299
Those are your top jokes voted by you, nominated by you.

1345
02:59:32,299 --> 02:59:33,299
Let's find out.

1346
02:59:33,299 --> 02:59:35,930
Sorry, I just punched you.

1347
02:59:35,930 --> 02:59:38,420
Can I get some of this off my face, too?

1348
02:59:38,420 --> 02:59:40,920
This is going to be permanent.

1349
02:59:40,920 --> 02:59:41,920
I just did it again.

1350
02:59:41,920 --> 02:59:45,440
What the hell am I doing?

1351
02:59:45,440 --> 02:59:48,440
Ladies and gentlemen, the best joke of the year,

1352
02:59:48,440 --> 02:59:53,379
taking more than five minutes to set up is...

1353
02:59:53,379 --> 02:59:56,379
Oh, it's an upset.

1354
02:59:56,379 --> 02:59:59,629
It's an upset.

1355
02:59:59,629 --> 03:00:03,469
This is an upset.

1356
03:00:03,469 --> 03:00:12,040
With 25% of the vote, 25%, the ultimate thumbnail.

1357
03:00:12,040 --> 03:00:14,040
The huge thumbnail wins.

1358
03:00:14,040 --> 03:00:22,420
And then scorn, far away at 12.6% of the vote, far away.

1359
03:00:22,420 --> 03:00:26,420
And then sleeping to five nights at Freddy's with 10% of the vote.

1360
03:00:26,420 --> 03:00:27,850
That's kind of an upset.

1361
03:00:27,850 --> 03:00:30,850
I thought that scorn, all the scorners in the chat here

1362
03:00:30,850 --> 03:00:35,559
are probably going to be pretty upset about that.

1363
03:00:35,559 --> 03:00:38,559
Well, we did the good one.

1364
03:00:38,559 --> 03:00:41,989
So why don't we do the bad one?

1365
03:00:41,989 --> 03:00:46,229
If you think that I nail it every time, you're wrong.

1366
03:00:46,229 --> 03:00:47,600
I have a tendency to...

1367
03:00:47,600 --> 03:00:49,600
There's a couple of duds every year.

1368
03:00:49,600 --> 03:00:51,780
Eh, a couple of duds.

1369
03:00:51,780 --> 03:00:53,780
Not every joke is funny.

1370
03:00:53,780 --> 03:00:54,780
I don't expect them to be.

1371
03:00:54,780 --> 03:00:58,590
But how do you know if something's going to be funny if you don't do it?

1372
03:00:58,590 --> 03:01:00,590
Ladies and gentlemen, here are your nominees

1373
03:01:00,590 --> 03:01:05,590
for the worst joke of the year, taking five minutes to set up.

1374
03:01:05,590 --> 03:01:16,510
What if I just, like, pretended to fall asleep on stream?

1375
03:01:16,510 --> 03:01:18,510
That's right, there it is.

1376
03:01:18,510 --> 03:01:20,510
All right, I'm going to pretend to fall asleep on stream.

1377
03:01:20,510 --> 03:01:22,510
I'm going to put text on the bottom that says, like,

1378
03:01:22,510 --> 03:01:24,510
Dude, wicked fucking tired.

1379
03:01:24,510 --> 03:01:27,780
I had a long day.

1380
03:01:27,780 --> 03:01:35,149
And then you're woken up by the jump scare.

1381
03:01:35,149 --> 03:01:44,329
Fuck!

1382
03:01:44,329 --> 03:01:51,670
Yeah. Yeah.

1383
03:01:51,670 --> 03:01:53,670
I don't know how I got in this Discord call,

1384
03:01:53,670 --> 03:01:54,670
but I need somebody to help.

1385
03:01:54,670 --> 03:01:56,670
I got the wrong server ID, I think.

1386
03:01:56,670 --> 03:01:58,909
I don't know how I got in this Discord call,

1387
03:01:58,909 --> 03:01:59,909
but I need somebody to help.

1388
03:01:59,909 --> 03:02:03,659
I got the wrong server ID, I think.

1389
03:02:03,659 --> 03:02:04,659
Did you click spectate? It's on the bottom left.

1390
03:02:04,659 --> 03:02:06,659
No, I clicked a goddamn arrow.

1391
03:02:06,659 --> 03:02:07,659
Where is it?

1392
03:02:07,659 --> 03:02:09,659
I don't know how I got in this Discord call,

1393
03:02:09,659 --> 03:02:10,659
but I need somebody to help.

1394
03:02:10,659 --> 03:02:12,659
I got the wrong server ID, I think.

1395
03:02:12,659 --> 03:02:13,659
Who the fuck is that?

1396
03:02:13,659 --> 03:02:15,659
I'm going to have to go, I think, somewhere.

1397
03:02:15,659 --> 03:02:17,659
Guys, I think I got the wrong Discord call.

1398
03:02:17,659 --> 03:02:18,659
I don't know how I got in here.

1399
03:02:18,659 --> 03:02:19,659
I got the wrong server ID.

1400
03:02:19,659 --> 03:02:20,659
I don't know what's happening.

1401
03:02:20,659 --> 03:02:21,659
If somebody can troubleshoot with me.

1402
03:02:21,659 --> 03:02:22,659
I think I have to go up here.

1403
03:02:22,659 --> 03:02:24,659
Who is that guy?

1404
03:02:24,659 --> 03:02:25,659
What a weird guy.

1405
03:02:25,659 --> 03:02:26,659
This guy's weird.

1406
03:02:26,659 --> 03:02:27,659
He's a lunatic.

1407
03:02:27,659 --> 03:02:28,659
Was that somebody in the call?

1408
03:02:28,659 --> 03:02:29,659
What was that?

1409
03:02:29,659 --> 03:02:31,659
Oh shit, I didn't know it was still on.

1410
03:02:31,659 --> 03:02:34,659
It's been on for hours now.

1411
03:02:34,659 --> 03:02:36,659
I forgot your old voice.

1412
03:02:36,659 --> 03:02:38,659
Can we ban Iron Giant?

1413
03:02:38,659 --> 03:02:39,659
No.

1414
03:02:39,659 --> 03:02:41,030
All right.

1415
03:02:41,030 --> 03:02:47,879
All right, we just need to figure out a solution to our problem.

1416
03:02:47,879 --> 03:02:48,879
I don't fucking care if we lost.

1417
03:02:48,879 --> 03:02:49,879
I'm doing the joke.

1418
03:02:49,879 --> 03:02:50,879
Yeah.

1419
03:02:50,879 --> 03:02:52,879
What's up, Jack?

1420
03:02:52,879 --> 03:02:54,379
That was pretty good.

1421
03:02:54,379 --> 03:02:56,379
That was phenomenal, Jerma.

1422
03:02:56,379 --> 03:02:57,379
That was a pretty good one.

1423
03:02:57,379 --> 03:02:59,379
Oh, just one hit, one hit, one hit, one hit, one hit.

1424
03:02:59,379 --> 03:03:00,379
He's dead.

1425
03:03:00,379 --> 03:03:01,379
Okay, we're good, good, good, good, good.

1426
03:03:01,379 --> 03:03:02,379
Yes.

1427
03:03:02,379 --> 03:03:03,379
Yeah.

1428
03:03:03,379 --> 03:03:04,379
Hey, what up?

1429
03:03:04,379 --> 03:03:05,379
What's up, Jack?

1430
03:03:05,379 --> 03:03:06,379
What's up, Jack?

1431
03:03:06,379 --> 03:03:08,379
I just bit my tongue in half.

1432
03:03:08,379 --> 03:03:09,379
We're in costume.

1433
03:03:09,379 --> 03:03:12,379
I'm Mercy from the Overwatch 2.

1434
03:03:12,379 --> 03:03:13,379
And who's that?

1435
03:03:13,379 --> 03:03:14,379
Hey, how are you?

1436
03:03:14,379 --> 03:03:15,379
It's me, Deadpool.

1437
03:03:15,379 --> 03:03:16,379
Nice to see everybody.

1438
03:03:16,379 --> 03:03:17,379
Oh, my God.

1439
03:03:17,379 --> 03:03:18,379
It's so good to have you here.

1440
03:03:18,379 --> 03:03:19,379
Yeah, special guest here.

1441
03:03:19,379 --> 03:03:20,379
So where do we start?

1442
03:03:20,379 --> 03:03:21,379
I don't know, man.

1443
03:03:21,379 --> 03:03:22,379
I just showed up.

1444
03:03:22,379 --> 03:03:23,379
I just got the call.

1445
03:03:23,379 --> 03:03:24,379
Yeah.

1446
03:03:24,379 --> 03:03:26,379
They were like, hey, man, do you want to be on Charlie Shaw?

1447
03:03:26,379 --> 03:03:27,379
And I'm like, I love that guy.

1448
03:03:27,379 --> 03:03:30,680
Of course I'm going to be on that show.

1449
03:03:30,680 --> 03:03:32,680
I knocked out that motherfucker in the parking lot, by the way.

1450
03:03:32,680 --> 03:03:33,680
He looked at me weird.

1451
03:03:33,680 --> 03:03:35,680
No, that sounds exactly what he deserved.

1452
03:03:35,680 --> 03:03:36,680
I'm going to hit that door.

1453
03:03:36,680 --> 03:03:37,860
Show him your high kick.

1454
03:03:37,860 --> 03:03:38,860
Yeah?

1455
03:03:38,860 --> 03:03:40,860
I went like this.

1456
03:03:40,860 --> 03:03:46,510
Hey, kids.

1457
03:03:46,510 --> 03:03:48,139
Soda.

1458
03:03:49,760 --> 03:03:53,790
This sucked so bad.

1459
03:03:53,790 --> 03:03:54,790
Nobody move.

1460
03:03:54,790 --> 03:03:55,790
It's starting to lag.

1461
03:03:55,790 --> 03:03:57,790
It's starting to lag out.

1462
03:03:57,790 --> 03:03:59,790
I'm starting to get sick, I think.

1463
03:03:59,790 --> 03:04:01,790
I'm going to get sick.

1464
03:04:01,790 --> 03:04:04,790
I'm at like 20 frames a second.

1465
03:04:04,790 --> 03:04:06,479
Oh, God.

1466
03:04:06,479 --> 03:04:07,479
It's getting sick.

1467
03:04:07,479 --> 03:04:09,479
Here we go.

1468
03:04:09,479 --> 03:04:12,770
Somebody said embarrassing.

1469
03:04:12,770 --> 03:04:13,770
Oh, shit.

1470
03:04:13,770 --> 03:04:14,770
Oh, shit.

1471
03:04:14,770 --> 03:04:15,770
This is bad.

1472
03:04:15,770 --> 03:04:16,770
Actually, be careful.

1473
03:04:16,770 --> 03:04:17,770
This might actually be flashing lights and stuff.

1474
03:04:17,770 --> 03:04:18,770
I'm not kidding.

1475
03:04:18,770 --> 03:04:19,770
These awards are embarrassing.

1476
03:04:19,770 --> 03:04:27,020
OK.

1477
03:04:27,020 --> 03:04:28,020
Here you go.

1478
03:04:28,020 --> 03:04:30,739
You ready?

1479
03:04:30,739 --> 03:04:47,030
This is the latest episode of Breaking Bad.

1480
03:04:47,030 --> 03:04:48,030
This is fucking stupid.

1481
03:04:48,030 --> 03:04:50,030
That was so bad.

1482
03:04:50,030 --> 03:04:52,030
This is fucking dumb, man.

1483
03:04:52,030 --> 03:04:53,030
This is dumb.

1484
03:04:53,030 --> 03:04:56,030
If Jerma reads this, he has to do a push-up on stream.

1485
03:05:23,579 --> 03:05:24,579
Oh, fuck.

1486
03:05:24,579 --> 03:05:25,579
Oh, fuck.

1487
03:05:25,579 --> 03:05:38,180
I would have voted for Five Nights at Freddy's.

1488
03:05:38,180 --> 03:05:42,139
That's what I would have voted for.

1489
03:05:42,139 --> 03:05:44,139
But some of those I don't think deserve to be there.

1490
03:05:44,139 --> 03:05:46,450
I really don't.

1491
03:05:46,450 --> 03:05:47,450
Breaking Bad was just, I don't know.

1492
03:05:47,450 --> 03:05:49,450
I was just reaching at that point.

1493
03:05:49,450 --> 03:05:51,450
Because we were on the high of Scooby-Doo.

1494
03:05:51,450 --> 03:05:53,450
What's new, Scooby-Doo?

1495
03:05:53,450 --> 03:05:54,450
Coming after you.

1496
03:05:54,450 --> 03:05:55,450
Gonna find that.

1497
03:05:55,450 --> 03:05:57,450
And it's like, wow, this is so much fun.

1498
03:05:57,450 --> 03:05:58,450
I'm having so much fun.

1499
03:05:58,450 --> 03:05:59,450
Oh, what are the TV shows?

1500
03:05:59,450 --> 03:06:02,450
What are the television shows can we do, right?

1501
03:06:02,450 --> 03:06:05,450
I was reaching on the high.

1502
03:06:05,450 --> 03:06:11,069
Ladies and gentlemen, your winner for worst joke of the entire year.

1503
03:06:11,069 --> 03:06:19,069
The worst joke of the year is, with 32% of the vote,

1504
03:06:19,069 --> 03:06:22,760
someone got in the Discord.

1505
03:06:22,760 --> 03:06:27,180
Someone got in the Discord, and it wasn't me.

1506
03:06:27,180 --> 03:06:29,180
Oh, someone's in the Discord.

1507
03:06:29,180 --> 03:06:34,180
Sleeping to Five Nights at Freddy's was 22%, but hold on a minute.

1508
03:06:34,180 --> 03:06:37,610
So number two is Sleeping to Five Nights at Freddy's.

1509
03:06:37,610 --> 03:06:43,610
Number three on best of the year was Sleeping to Five Nights at Freddy's.

1510
03:06:43,610 --> 03:06:47,100
So it was top three on here and top three on here.

1511
03:06:47,100 --> 03:06:49,469
You guys need to make up your mind.

1512
03:06:49,469 --> 03:06:54,290
And then doing push-ups was 16.8%.

1513
03:06:54,290 --> 03:06:58,510
I would have voted for that one, probably.

1514
03:06:58,510 --> 03:07:03,329
The Breaking Bad one was pretty awful, but, you know,

1515
03:07:03,329 --> 03:07:07,209
I'm not looking forward to these next couple categories.

1516
03:07:07,209 --> 03:07:13,989
These videos are probably 10 minutes long.

1517
03:07:13,989 --> 03:07:18,420
Something about the worst and best noise categories this year,

1518
03:07:18,420 --> 03:07:22,110
I mean, the mods went through it.

1519
03:07:22,110 --> 03:07:24,110
Me and Holly went through it.

1520
03:07:25,110 --> 03:07:27,479
We had to narrow this down.

1521
03:07:27,479 --> 03:07:31,229
Best and worst noise of the year,

1522
03:07:31,229 --> 03:07:36,229
there were 60 nominees until we really had to get rid of some.

1523
03:07:36,229 --> 03:07:39,229
I think we brought it down to like 25 in each category.

1524
03:07:39,229 --> 03:07:42,229
So strap in, turn your volume down,

1525
03:07:42,229 --> 03:07:51,829
because here are your nominees for best noise of the year.

1526
03:07:51,829 --> 03:07:56,860
Or turn your volume up, if that's what you care about.

1527
03:07:56,860 --> 03:07:59,860
Jesus. Oh, what the fuck?

1528
03:08:00,860 --> 03:08:03,450
No!

1529
03:08:03,450 --> 03:08:09,379
How long are they going to hold? I can hold a Wilma for.

1530
03:08:09,379 --> 03:08:29,559
Wilma! Fucking long, dude.

1531
03:08:32,760 --> 03:08:34,760
Oh, I got a drink too.

1532
03:08:37,760 --> 03:08:38,760
That's pretty sus!

1533
03:08:38,760 --> 03:08:41,760
There was a cricket outside last night.

1534
03:08:41,760 --> 03:08:43,760
I swear to God, I always wanted to record it,

1535
03:08:43,760 --> 03:08:45,760
like just get audio recorded,

1536
03:08:45,760 --> 03:08:50,760
because this thing was so loud and it was going super speed.

1537
03:08:50,760 --> 03:08:52,760
It wasn't...

1538
03:08:53,760 --> 03:08:57,450
This guy was looking for somebody.

1539
03:08:57,450 --> 03:08:59,450
It was like...

1540
03:08:59,450 --> 03:09:07,590
It was like static. I couldn't stand it.

1541
03:09:07,590 --> 03:09:09,590
You know what sound that makes too.

1542
03:09:09,590 --> 03:09:11,590
It's like...

1543
03:09:14,590 --> 03:09:16,590
You just like that because it sounds like the teacher noise.

1544
03:09:16,590 --> 03:09:19,280
Way!

1545
03:09:19,280 --> 03:09:21,280
I can put it over my head.

1546
03:09:21,280 --> 03:09:24,280
I'm moving an amount of water from one room to another.

1547
03:09:24,280 --> 03:09:26,280
I can go like this.

1548
03:09:29,709 --> 03:09:31,209
Should I do this?

1549
03:09:31,209 --> 03:09:33,209
Okay, I'll do it.

1550
03:09:37,329 --> 03:09:39,329
No, I just heard that in my head.

1551
03:09:39,329 --> 03:09:45,659
It hurt.

1552
03:09:47,659 --> 03:09:49,659
I heard somebody laugh off camera.

1553
03:09:49,659 --> 03:09:53,659
This is the Tasmanian devil in the electric chair.

1554
03:09:53,659 --> 03:09:56,659
Okay, this doesn't sound right at all.

1555
03:09:56,659 --> 03:09:58,659
And let's do a scream test.

1556
03:09:59,659 --> 03:10:01,659
Woo!

1557
03:10:02,659 --> 03:10:03,659
Fixed it.

1558
03:10:03,659 --> 03:10:05,659
How do I look plastic today?

1559
03:10:05,659 --> 03:10:11,489
I mean, I don't feel plastic.

1560
03:10:17,899 --> 03:10:21,680
Dude, too loud, too one up.

1561
03:10:31,270 --> 03:10:41,659
Fuck!

1562
03:10:41,659 --> 03:10:43,659
Oh no, it's one of those...

1563
03:10:47,659 --> 03:10:49,659
Are you wearing red because you're the imposter?

1564
03:10:49,659 --> 03:10:51,659
Yes.

1565
03:10:59,819 --> 03:11:02,819
When I'm lying in my deathbed and I'm connected to like...

1566
03:11:02,819 --> 03:11:04,819
You know what? I'm like 90 or something.

1567
03:11:04,819 --> 03:11:05,819
I got 100.

1568
03:11:05,819 --> 03:11:08,120
And everyone's like gathered around the bed and everyone's like...

1569
03:11:08,120 --> 03:11:11,120
Oh, let's just say goodbye to grandpa, right?

1570
03:11:11,120 --> 03:11:13,120
You bet your ass that I'm going to be like...

1571
03:11:15,059 --> 03:11:23,360
You bet your fucking ass that's the last thing I'm leaving you with.

1572
03:11:23,360 --> 03:11:24,360
Fuck!

1573
03:11:24,360 --> 03:11:27,430
Give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it...

1574
03:11:50,930 --> 03:12:01,829
How many people are here right now on the channel?

1575
03:12:01,829 --> 03:12:03,829
Do I have a number?

1576
03:12:03,829 --> 03:12:06,719
65.

1577
03:12:06,719 --> 03:12:10,340
There's 65,000 people here.

1578
03:12:10,340 --> 03:12:13,610
And you just got subjected to that.

1579
03:12:13,610 --> 03:12:17,920
So, should I apologize?

1580
03:12:17,920 --> 03:12:19,920
Or should we wait?

1581
03:12:20,520 --> 03:12:24,120
Should we wait for this one?

1582
03:12:24,120 --> 03:12:26,280
I'm gonna hold my apologies till this one.

1583
03:12:28,250 --> 03:12:31,889
Ladies and gentlemen, the, oh, I may have ripped it.

1584
03:12:31,889 --> 03:12:36,620
The winner for best noise of the entire year.

1585
03:12:37,540 --> 03:12:39,870
Was it ever gonna be close?

1586
03:12:39,870 --> 03:12:42,430
Let's spam it in the chat.

1587
03:12:42,430 --> 03:12:43,530
You know what it is.

1588
03:12:43,530 --> 03:12:45,370
Spam it.

1589
03:12:45,370 --> 03:12:47,219
I'll do it if you spam it.

1590
03:12:47,219 --> 03:12:48,620
I'll do it if you spam it.

1591
03:12:56,569 --> 03:12:59,389
Scored.

1592
03:12:59,389 --> 03:13:04,389
With 39% of the vote, scorn absolutely killed it.

1593
03:13:07,020 --> 03:13:09,940
Gimme, gimme, gimme was only 15.

1594
03:13:09,940 --> 03:13:12,379
Scorn absolutely dominated this category.

1595
03:13:13,299 --> 03:13:17,200
And then are you the imposter was three.

1596
03:13:17,200 --> 03:13:19,620
So scorn, a scorn sweep right there.

1597
03:13:19,620 --> 03:13:21,420
40% of the vote almost.

1598
03:13:21,420 --> 03:13:23,540
39.7% actually.

1599
03:13:25,139 --> 03:13:26,760
Which is, that's a lot.

1600
03:13:26,760 --> 03:13:29,940
So to the almost 60, 70,000 people that are here right now,

1601
03:13:30,700 --> 03:13:33,020
I apologize for this next category.

1602
03:13:33,020 --> 03:13:34,700
I apologize in advance.

1603
03:13:34,700 --> 03:13:36,719
I said a lot of sorry's already,

1604
03:13:36,719 --> 03:13:38,819
but it's time for another one.

1605
03:13:38,819 --> 03:13:42,219
I'm sorry about this category.

1606
03:13:42,219 --> 03:13:45,059
Most nominees, I think total,

1607
03:13:45,059 --> 03:13:47,459
that had to get dwindled down,

1608
03:13:47,459 --> 03:13:51,219
but we have a best noise, we have a worst noise.

1609
03:13:51,219 --> 03:13:54,459
They could just be the same category.

1610
03:13:54,459 --> 03:13:58,659
I should just do a thing where it's just noise of the year

1611
03:13:58,659 --> 03:14:00,739
because why even have two categories?

1612
03:14:01,659 --> 03:14:05,639
Here are your nominees for worst noise of the year.

1613
03:14:27,149 --> 03:14:28,229
It's just, you know what I mean?

1614
03:14:28,229 --> 03:14:34,780
It's just the, it doesn't even lather up either.

1615
03:14:34,780 --> 03:14:44,290
I'm so, that was bad.

1616
03:14:44,290 --> 03:14:50,120
You've seen me do it like a hundred times.

1617
03:14:50,120 --> 03:14:52,159
It, you can't dodge them all.

1618
03:14:52,159 --> 03:15:01,739
He's like, he's turning.

1619
03:15:01,739 --> 03:15:03,500
Oh shit, he's turning.

1620
03:15:03,500 --> 03:15:05,340
He just growled at us.

1621
03:15:05,340 --> 03:15:07,620
Wrong game, wrong game from software.

1622
03:15:07,620 --> 03:15:08,459
Wrong game.

1623
03:15:45,000 --> 03:15:46,100
Like some people eat a lobster.

1624
03:15:46,100 --> 03:15:47,899
Like it's literally the last thing they're ever going to eat

1625
03:15:47,899 --> 03:15:49,629
in their entire life.

1626
03:15:49,629 --> 03:15:54,069
And they like, what's in here?

1627
03:15:54,069 --> 03:15:57,670
Oh, and it's just like, God damn it.

1628
03:15:57,670 --> 03:15:59,760
What are you doing?

1629
03:15:59,760 --> 03:16:05,159
Oh, there's some still in there.

1630
03:16:05,200 --> 03:16:06,959
And I just, I just, I don't like it.

1631
03:16:06,959 --> 03:16:07,799
I don't like it.

1632
03:16:07,799 --> 03:16:08,760
I don't like it at all.

1633
03:16:08,760 --> 03:16:09,600
It's revolting.

1634
03:16:09,600 --> 03:16:10,440
It's absolutely fucking revolting.

1635
03:16:10,440 --> 03:16:12,079
How about you fucking relax?

1636
03:16:14,739 --> 03:16:17,979
Young Madduck, apprentice to Hunwit, the dream chanter,

1637
03:16:17,979 --> 03:16:20,139
removes his instrument from its case.

1638
03:16:20,139 --> 03:16:23,219
Its features, compose, take on a startling dignity.

1639
03:16:26,260 --> 03:16:27,100
Let's hear it.

1640
03:16:43,870 --> 03:16:45,110
This is on here twice?

1641
03:16:47,250 --> 03:16:49,090
How many times was this nominated?

1642
03:16:55,549 --> 03:16:58,110
Can I just say this is the worst moment of the whole year?

1643
03:16:58,110 --> 03:16:58,950
I can say that, right?

1644
03:16:58,950 --> 03:17:01,860
It's my channel.

1645
03:17:01,860 --> 03:17:07,260
Wait, so when it goes, does it?

1646
03:17:07,260 --> 03:17:14,729
It goes like, I just threw one of those nerf,

1647
03:17:14,729 --> 03:17:17,049
you know those nerfs, whistlers?

1648
03:17:17,049 --> 03:17:18,489
The thing that like Brett Favre

1649
03:17:18,489 --> 03:17:19,850
was in the commercial and he threw it like,

1650
03:17:19,850 --> 03:17:21,569
ah, look there, I can throw this a hundred yards.

1651
03:17:21,569 --> 03:17:25,690
And it goes, I just threw one of those.

1652
03:17:32,219 --> 03:17:33,540
Now I know what this is for.

1653
03:17:33,620 --> 03:17:35,100
We're all the way over here.

1654
03:17:38,100 --> 03:17:38,940
So.

1655
03:17:38,940 --> 03:17:39,780
What's wrong with you?

1656
03:17:39,780 --> 03:17:40,620
What's your limit?

1657
03:17:44,979 --> 03:17:45,819
Hold on.

1658
03:17:46,879 --> 03:17:48,299
No.

1659
03:17:48,299 --> 03:17:51,459
Oh, I'm sorry, everybody in production

1660
03:17:51,459 --> 03:17:53,100
probably fucking just cringed.

1661
03:17:58,760 --> 03:17:59,600
Did you guys hear that?

1662
03:17:59,600 --> 03:18:07,420
What the fuck was that?

1663
03:18:07,420 --> 03:18:10,870
There is recency bias, I think, on this one.

1664
03:18:10,870 --> 03:18:13,959
We have some recency bias, I think.

1665
03:18:13,959 --> 03:18:16,719
I don't think, I can literally see it through the paper,

1666
03:18:16,760 --> 03:18:17,600
by the way.

1667
03:18:19,860 --> 03:18:20,700
I peeked.

1668
03:18:23,479 --> 03:18:25,879
Ladies and gentlemen, the worst noise of the entire year,

1669
03:18:25,879 --> 03:18:29,940
recency bias, come on.

1670
03:18:29,940 --> 03:18:34,500
The multiverse is squeal at 20% of the vote.

1671
03:18:34,500 --> 03:18:36,860
Not that bad.

1672
03:18:36,860 --> 03:18:40,579
Growls at chat with 18.8.

1673
03:18:40,579 --> 03:18:44,139
And then I don't even, I don't know what this one is.

1674
03:18:44,139 --> 03:18:47,870
Suck, snort, wheeze, cackle.

1675
03:18:47,870 --> 03:18:50,290
Do we even know, what is that one?

1676
03:18:50,329 --> 03:18:52,569
Suck, snort, wheeze, cackle.

1677
03:18:52,569 --> 03:18:54,850
I was trying to watch, but I couldn't even,

1678
03:18:54,850 --> 03:18:56,290
I don't know what that one is.

1679
03:18:57,569 --> 03:18:58,450
Very good to know.

1680
03:19:00,299 --> 03:19:02,180
A third most skipped category.

1681
03:19:03,299 --> 03:19:08,299
13% of you that took the test did not take this one.

1682
03:19:08,299 --> 03:19:09,780
You're like, fuck it, I don't wanna hear that.

1683
03:19:09,780 --> 03:19:11,420
I don't care.

1684
03:19:11,420 --> 03:19:14,139
Which makes sense considering there's so many categories.

1685
03:19:14,139 --> 03:19:17,459
And okay, but multiverse is squeal.

1686
03:19:17,459 --> 03:19:19,100
Hey, multiverse is a great game.

1687
03:19:19,100 --> 03:19:20,459
You should try it.

1688
03:19:20,500 --> 03:19:21,340
You know what?

1689
03:19:21,340 --> 03:19:23,780
Can we check in with the puzzle room?

1690
03:19:23,780 --> 03:19:24,780
Let's take a look at the puzzle room.

1691
03:19:24,780 --> 03:19:26,940
How's the puzzle, the puzzler's doing?

1692
03:19:29,219 --> 03:19:30,059
Damn it.

1693
03:19:32,700 --> 03:19:34,299
No one's doing anything.

1694
03:19:36,899 --> 03:19:39,899
Have they not done any of the puzzle?

1695
03:19:41,290 --> 03:19:42,889
Zero, hold on.

1696
03:19:44,180 --> 03:19:46,819
There's only one person doing it.

1697
03:19:46,819 --> 03:19:47,780
I'm going in there.

1698
03:19:49,020 --> 03:19:52,780
There's only one, they're all just like eating sandwiches.

1699
03:19:53,420 --> 03:19:54,739
I need to see the progress.

1700
03:19:54,739 --> 03:20:05,889
Oh my God.

1701
03:20:05,889 --> 03:20:14,020
I'm not gonna be angry.

1702
03:20:14,020 --> 03:20:14,860
Hi everybody.

1703
03:20:19,940 --> 03:20:23,180
It seems as if there is,

1704
03:20:23,180 --> 03:20:26,540
it looks like you've blocked out some areas.

1705
03:20:28,299 --> 03:20:29,540
Can you get this?

1706
03:20:31,100 --> 03:20:32,299
Where's the camera?

1707
03:20:32,299 --> 03:20:34,459
Can you see this over here?

1708
03:20:35,420 --> 03:20:39,959
They have one edge of one of the corners.

1709
03:20:41,559 --> 03:20:43,159
What have you been doing in here?

1710
03:20:44,040 --> 03:20:44,879
What's going on?

1711
03:20:44,879 --> 03:20:45,719
What are you doing here?

1712
03:20:45,719 --> 03:20:46,559
What is this?

1713
03:20:46,559 --> 03:20:47,399
You're playing cards?

1714
03:20:47,399 --> 03:20:48,239
Yeah.

1715
03:20:53,159 --> 03:20:56,700
Excuse me.

1716
03:20:56,700 --> 03:21:01,090
What?

1717
03:21:01,090 --> 03:21:04,829
Santa said to be nicer.

1718
03:21:04,829 --> 03:21:16,329
So if you could please finish one section.

1719
03:21:17,370 --> 03:21:19,530
This was a lot of money.

1720
03:21:19,530 --> 03:21:20,850
This cost a lot of money.

1721
03:21:20,850 --> 03:21:22,530
You heard Ludwig and you heard H. Racker.

1722
03:21:22,530 --> 03:21:24,809
By the way, where the fuck are they?

1723
03:21:24,809 --> 03:21:26,409
Sorry if I swear.

1724
03:21:26,409 --> 03:21:29,409
You know what?

1725
03:21:29,489 --> 03:21:30,850
They're drinking.

1726
03:21:30,850 --> 03:21:33,489
And they're drinking too.

1727
03:21:33,489 --> 03:21:34,450
You know what?

1728
03:21:34,450 --> 03:21:35,690
Deal me.

1729
03:21:35,690 --> 03:21:38,000
You wanna go?

1730
03:21:38,000 --> 03:21:40,000
Blackjack, you and me.

1731
03:21:40,000 --> 03:21:40,840
Who wants to go?

1732
03:21:40,840 --> 03:21:42,159
You and me?

1733
03:21:42,159 --> 03:21:44,079
Blackjack, I'll be the dealer.

1734
03:21:45,120 --> 03:21:46,360
Where are the cards?

1735
03:21:46,360 --> 03:21:47,680
Let's go Blackjack.

1736
03:21:47,680 --> 03:21:50,479
What are these comically huge cards?

1737
03:21:52,340 --> 03:21:55,180
Hey, by the way, is this the Ace of Clubs?

1738
03:21:55,180 --> 03:21:58,379
Nope, that would have been fucking insane if it was.

1739
03:21:58,379 --> 03:21:59,219
You wanna go Blackjack?

1740
03:21:59,219 --> 03:22:00,420
Ready?

1741
03:22:00,420 --> 03:22:01,700
You're not gonna play Blackjack?

1742
03:22:01,700 --> 03:22:02,540
I got this.

1743
03:22:04,409 --> 03:22:06,209
Why did you write this?

1744
03:22:06,209 --> 03:22:07,450
We wanted to see that movie.

1745
03:22:07,450 --> 03:22:08,850
You wanted to see that movie?

1746
03:22:08,850 --> 03:22:09,930
We wanted to see it.

1747
03:22:09,930 --> 03:22:12,930
In here.

1748
03:22:12,930 --> 03:22:13,889
We were hoping.

1749
03:22:13,889 --> 03:22:16,729
You just wanted to see Avatar 2, The Way of Water.

1750
03:22:16,729 --> 03:22:19,969
We don't pay us enough to go watch it ourselves.

1751
03:22:19,969 --> 03:22:21,129
What does this one say?

1752
03:22:22,489 --> 03:22:26,090
Send hot cups of, that's a funny joke.

1753
03:22:26,090 --> 03:22:27,290
What does this one say?

1754
03:22:28,370 --> 03:22:30,930
My name is Danny Elfman, please hurry.

1755
03:22:30,930 --> 03:22:32,290
Are you kidding?

1756
03:22:32,290 --> 03:22:33,690
I actually don't get it.

1757
03:22:33,690 --> 03:22:35,729
Do it for Puzzle Girl.

1758
03:22:35,729 --> 03:22:36,850
Who's Puzzle Girl?

1759
03:22:37,850 --> 03:22:39,620
You.

1760
03:22:39,620 --> 03:22:41,620
What are we doing exactly?

1761
03:22:42,579 --> 03:22:43,420
Do it.

1762
03:22:44,979 --> 03:22:45,940
Okay.

1763
03:22:45,940 --> 03:22:46,780
You ready?

1764
03:22:49,020 --> 03:22:50,979
Everybody here is being, by the way,

1765
03:22:50,979 --> 03:22:52,780
everybody here is being paid.

1766
03:22:52,780 --> 03:22:55,059
Just wanna make sure everyone understands that.

1767
03:22:55,059 --> 03:22:56,899
How much you bet?

1768
03:22:56,899 --> 03:22:59,340
Hey, don't worry, the bank will take care of you.

1769
03:22:59,340 --> 03:23:00,899
Here's like 600 bucks.

1770
03:23:10,809 --> 03:23:12,930
Right there is eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13.

1771
03:23:12,930 --> 03:23:14,450
That's 14.

1772
03:23:14,450 --> 03:23:15,290
What are you gonna do?

1773
03:23:15,290 --> 03:23:18,090
Versus a, by the way, can you see this?

1774
03:23:18,090 --> 03:23:19,129
I got a 10 showing here.

1775
03:23:19,129 --> 03:23:20,930
What are you gonna do?

1776
03:23:20,930 --> 03:23:22,700
You're gonna hit.

1777
03:23:22,700 --> 03:23:24,899
That is eight, five, 10.

1778
03:23:24,899 --> 03:23:25,940
That's 18.

1779
03:23:25,940 --> 03:23:27,059
You're gonna stay?

1780
03:23:27,059 --> 03:23:27,940
Staying, okay.

1781
03:23:29,600 --> 03:23:34,959
Don't look.

1782
03:23:34,959 --> 03:23:35,879
17.

1783
03:23:47,629 --> 03:23:48,469
Stop!

1784
03:23:50,440 --> 03:23:51,639
Give me that.

1785
03:23:51,639 --> 03:23:52,559
Give me that toy.

1786
03:23:52,559 --> 03:23:54,280
Don't give it to him.

1787
03:23:54,280 --> 03:23:57,159
Santa, if you're watching, I'm just being funny.

1788
03:23:57,159 --> 03:23:58,000
Give me that toy.

1789
03:23:58,600 --> 03:24:07,340
I made sure to not, five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40,

1790
03:24:11,739 --> 03:24:15,540
45, 50, 55, 60.

1791
03:24:15,540 --> 03:24:16,780
You just made $60.

1792
03:24:31,340 --> 03:24:32,819
Gonna do another category.

1793
03:24:32,819 --> 03:24:33,659
Excuse me.

1794
03:24:33,659 --> 03:24:34,979
Merry Christmas!

1795
03:24:34,979 --> 03:24:41,059
Merry Christmas!

1796
03:24:41,059 --> 03:24:44,079
What do you mean you can't do, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1797
03:24:44,079 --> 03:24:45,920
Can't do math?

1798
03:24:45,920 --> 03:24:46,760
What happened?

1799
03:24:47,840 --> 03:24:48,959
I can't do math.

1800
03:24:48,959 --> 03:24:51,059
What happened?

1801
03:24:51,579 --> 03:24:52,420
Wait.

1802
03:24:52,420 --> 03:24:53,260
Count those cards.

1803
03:24:53,260 --> 03:24:54,260
Hold on a second.

1804
03:24:56,819 --> 03:24:58,020
This is 17.

1805
03:24:58,020 --> 03:24:58,860
That's 10.

1806
03:24:58,860 --> 03:24:59,700
18.

1807
03:24:59,700 --> 03:25:02,069
What are you talking about?

1808
03:25:02,069 --> 03:25:03,469
She won.

1809
03:25:03,469 --> 03:25:04,350
We can't count.

1810
03:25:04,350 --> 03:25:05,750
That's literally 18 versus seven.

1811
03:25:05,750 --> 03:25:07,590
What are you talking about?

1812
03:25:07,590 --> 03:25:09,229
I'm a man of my word.

1813
03:25:09,229 --> 03:25:10,829
So guess what?

1814
03:25:10,829 --> 03:25:16,200
All the elves in this area, you're going to split $60.

1815
03:25:18,000 --> 03:25:24,780
Woo!

1816
03:25:24,780 --> 03:25:27,139
Elves, elves, elves, elves, elves, elves, elves, elves,

1817
03:25:27,139 --> 03:25:28,459
elves, elves, elves, elves, elves, elves, elves, elves,

1818
03:25:28,459 --> 03:25:29,420
13 elves.

1819
03:25:29,420 --> 03:25:32,459
Ladies and gentlemen, 13 elves divided,

1820
03:25:32,459 --> 03:25:34,500
60 divided by 13 is?

1821
03:25:34,500 --> 03:25:36,059
$100.

1822
03:25:36,059 --> 03:25:39,090
Yeah!

1823
03:25:39,090 --> 03:25:40,209
Each.

1824
03:25:40,209 --> 03:25:42,170
It's like two bucks each.

1825
03:25:42,170 --> 03:25:43,329
Hey, how about this?

1826
03:25:44,370 --> 03:25:45,969
We'll double your pay.

1827
03:25:45,969 --> 03:25:53,059
Woo!

1828
03:25:53,059 --> 03:25:56,790
How much they were getting paid in the newspaper.

1829
03:25:56,790 --> 03:25:57,750
Whatever.

1830
03:25:57,750 --> 03:26:00,750
I mean, they were paid to do a puzzle

1831
03:26:00,750 --> 03:26:02,709
and they didn't do it.

1832
03:26:02,709 --> 03:26:05,149
Let me make sure, let me be very clear.

1833
03:26:05,149 --> 03:26:06,629
They were paid, they were all those people

1834
03:26:06,629 --> 03:26:10,149
who were paid to be here.

1835
03:26:10,790 --> 03:26:14,190
They were all paid to be here to do a puzzle.

1836
03:26:14,190 --> 03:26:17,450
What if we talk about how much income is that worth?

1837
03:26:17,450 --> 03:26:18,489
I'll double their pay.

1838
03:26:18,489 --> 03:26:19,409
Fine.

1839
03:26:19,409 --> 03:26:22,549
Yeah.

1840
03:26:22,549 --> 03:26:23,389
How about this?

1841
03:26:23,389 --> 03:26:25,440
Hey elves, can you hear me?

1842
03:26:25,440 --> 03:26:28,920
Elves, you can hear me, right?

1843
03:26:28,920 --> 03:26:30,639
How about this?

1844
03:26:30,639 --> 03:26:33,680
You get one section done.

1845
03:26:33,680 --> 03:26:37,459
And I mean even a border.

1846
03:26:37,459 --> 03:26:40,540
And I'll quadruple your pay.

1847
03:26:40,540 --> 03:26:44,829
I wonder if they'll do it.

1848
03:26:44,829 --> 03:26:47,790
I will five times your pay.

1849
03:26:47,790 --> 03:26:52,239
Get a border done.

1850
03:26:52,239 --> 03:26:54,079
A hundred each?

1851
03:26:54,079 --> 03:26:56,200
Look, now they're all standing.

1852
03:26:56,200 --> 03:26:57,520
Now they're all ready to go.

1853
03:26:57,520 --> 03:26:59,319
They're like, holy shit, let's go.

1854
03:27:04,620 --> 03:27:07,709
They were all sitting before.

1855
03:27:07,709 --> 03:27:10,709
Now, hey, can we give it up for the elves?

1856
03:27:10,709 --> 03:27:13,500
In the chat, give it up for the elves.

1857
03:27:13,500 --> 03:27:15,739
You know, hey, hey, hey, hey, you know what?

1858
03:27:15,739 --> 03:27:16,819
Hey.

1859
03:27:16,819 --> 03:27:18,149
Hey.

1860
03:27:18,149 --> 03:27:20,389
Let's five times their pay for fucking no reason.

1861
03:27:20,389 --> 03:27:22,229
How does that sound?

1862
03:27:22,229 --> 03:27:23,049
I'll do it.

1863
03:27:23,049 --> 03:27:27,229
Easy.

1864
03:27:27,270 --> 03:27:28,690
Do the puzzle.

1865
03:27:28,690 --> 03:27:30,129
That's what you're here for.

1866
03:27:30,129 --> 03:27:32,409
And I may have almost hit somebody in the face

1867
03:27:32,409 --> 03:27:34,569
with that turkey that I threw.

1868
03:27:35,569 --> 03:27:36,489
All right.

1869
03:27:36,489 --> 03:27:38,049
We're at the next category.

1870
03:27:38,049 --> 03:27:40,370
This is best one guy moment.

1871
03:27:42,229 --> 03:27:45,190
One guy, there's a lot of people here.

1872
03:27:45,190 --> 03:27:47,629
I imagine some of you don't know what the hell this means.

1873
03:27:47,629 --> 03:27:52,629
A one guy is when somebody kind of derails the stream.

1874
03:27:54,709 --> 03:27:55,989
I will see it.

1875
03:27:55,989 --> 03:27:57,870
I will comment on it.

1876
03:27:57,950 --> 03:28:01,469
And it changes the outcome of the rest of the day.

1877
03:28:01,469 --> 03:28:03,270
It's not just, oh, yeah, yeah, I read a comment.

1878
03:28:03,270 --> 03:28:04,270
No, no, no, no.

1879
03:28:04,270 --> 03:28:06,750
A one guy moment is you've changed

1880
03:28:06,750 --> 03:28:09,110
the course of history completely.

1881
03:28:12,129 --> 03:28:13,329
Here are your nominees.

1882
03:28:13,329 --> 03:28:15,729
The best one guy moment of the year.

1883
03:28:24,819 --> 03:28:26,739
I don't, I'm not gonna encourage this behavior,

1884
03:28:26,739 --> 03:28:28,659
but I'm gonna tell you something right now.

1885
03:28:28,659 --> 03:28:30,780
Don't fucking, this is not to be encouraged,

1886
03:28:30,780 --> 03:28:32,860
but it was just like, what the fuck, man?

1887
03:28:34,020 --> 03:28:36,620
Somebody asked what the baseball stream is.

1888
03:28:36,659 --> 03:28:37,500
And I said, whatever.

1889
03:28:37,500 --> 03:28:39,340
And then like, it's been like five minutes.

1890
03:28:39,340 --> 03:28:40,860
It's been like at least five minutes.

1891
03:28:40,860 --> 03:28:42,780
Somebody like added that person, I think,

1892
03:28:42,780 --> 03:28:46,059
and said he's gonna shove an entire baseball up his ass

1893
03:28:46,059 --> 03:28:47,020
on stream.

1894
03:28:47,020 --> 03:28:48,579
This person's name too.

1895
03:28:48,579 --> 03:28:50,100
Yeah, what the fuck?

1896
03:28:50,100 --> 03:28:52,219
Their name was Ball Fondler.

1897
03:28:52,219 --> 03:28:54,219
Okay?

1898
03:28:54,219 --> 03:28:55,059
Okay?

1899
03:28:55,059 --> 03:28:56,700
Remember, you're on the website.

1900
03:28:58,139 --> 03:28:58,979
What?

1901
03:29:00,379 --> 03:29:02,059
You're on the QR code?

1902
03:29:02,059 --> 03:29:02,899
What?

1903
03:29:02,899 --> 03:29:09,049
It's taking this friend of thumbnails.

1904
03:29:09,090 --> 03:29:11,000
Is it there?

1905
03:29:11,000 --> 03:29:12,719
All right.

1906
03:29:12,719 --> 03:29:15,590
What?

1907
03:29:15,590 --> 03:29:18,149
All right, now put the tarantula in my mouth.

1908
03:29:18,149 --> 03:29:19,829
Put the tarantula in my mouth.

1909
03:29:19,829 --> 03:29:21,670
I'm gonna be like shocked that it's in there.

1910
03:29:21,670 --> 03:29:22,510
You know what I mean?

1911
03:29:22,510 --> 03:29:25,899
Like.

1912
03:29:25,899 --> 03:29:30,040
I can't even believe it.

1913
03:29:30,040 --> 03:29:34,079
He's, the dev, the dev is even sick of this joke.

1914
03:29:34,079 --> 03:29:35,760
The dev is like, all right, this is kind of funny,

1915
03:29:35,760 --> 03:29:37,600
but like fucking hurry up.

1916
03:29:37,600 --> 03:29:39,719
I mean, we have to summon the person

1917
03:29:39,719 --> 03:29:41,840
that's called barf drinker.

1918
03:29:41,840 --> 03:29:42,680
Okay?

1919
03:29:42,680 --> 03:29:43,520
And then that's it.

1920
03:29:43,520 --> 03:29:45,280
Oh my God, I'm gonna get BM'd, aren't I?

1921
03:29:48,020 --> 03:29:54,780
I'm so stupid.

1922
03:29:54,780 --> 03:29:56,620
He's throwing rocks at me.

1923
03:29:56,620 --> 03:29:57,459
All right.

1924
03:29:57,459 --> 03:29:59,500
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1925
03:30:00,540 --> 03:30:02,020
No, no, no.

1926
03:30:02,020 --> 03:30:08,889
I'm not gonna let this happen.

1927
03:30:08,889 --> 03:30:09,889
Oh my God, I'm dead.

1928
03:30:09,889 --> 03:30:11,250
All right, I can't believe it.

1929
03:30:11,250 --> 03:30:12,610
We're watching you in a bar, Jerma.

1930
03:30:12,610 --> 03:30:14,579
Do something wacky.

1931
03:30:14,579 --> 03:30:17,850
Hey.

1932
03:30:17,850 --> 03:30:19,610
Hey, this one, this one goes out to,

1933
03:30:19,610 --> 03:30:22,340
this one goes out to all y'all in the bar.

1934
03:30:22,340 --> 03:30:23,540
Hey.

1935
03:30:23,540 --> 03:30:30,020
Three, two, one, let's go.

1936
03:30:30,020 --> 03:30:32,750
Mm, green tea.

1937
03:30:32,750 --> 03:30:35,069
They can't even hear me.

1938
03:30:35,069 --> 03:30:36,350
Should I try to communicate?

1939
03:30:36,350 --> 03:30:40,760
Hey, you, wait, look.

1940
03:30:40,760 --> 03:30:45,340
Hey, everybody, hey.

1941
03:30:45,340 --> 03:30:52,909
One, two, three.

1942
03:30:52,909 --> 03:30:54,569
Yeah.

1943
03:30:54,569 --> 03:30:55,770
Oh, I wanna show this too.

1944
03:30:55,770 --> 03:30:57,219
Hold on.

1945
03:30:57,219 --> 03:30:59,860
Somebody, somebody actually made this.

1946
03:30:59,860 --> 03:31:04,360
These are really romantic candles.

1947
03:31:04,360 --> 03:31:10,059
Oh, it probably stinks up here.

1948
03:31:10,059 --> 03:31:15,540
Boss, I filled the room with red candles like you wanted.

1949
03:31:15,540 --> 03:31:19,659
Jerry, you fucking idiot.

1950
03:31:19,659 --> 03:31:23,020
Boss, you have to get the red cinnamon apple candle

1951
03:31:23,020 --> 03:31:25,260
from Yankee Candle and put it in every room.

1952
03:31:27,399 --> 03:31:30,750
Somebody said just eat a handful.

1953
03:31:30,750 --> 03:31:32,149
That'd be so fucked up.

1954
03:31:32,149 --> 03:31:33,149
You'd probably have like,

1955
03:31:33,149 --> 03:31:37,500
you'd probably have like a fucking like mental breakdown.

1956
03:31:37,500 --> 03:31:38,860
It's not designed for that.

1957
03:31:38,860 --> 03:31:40,059
Eat a handful.

1958
03:31:41,760 --> 03:31:44,899
That'd be fucking disgusting.

1959
03:31:44,899 --> 03:31:46,020
I'm kind of curious.

1960
03:31:46,020 --> 03:31:47,219
I'm curious, let's go.

1961
03:31:59,489 --> 03:32:00,969
It tastes like hamburger meat.

1962
03:32:00,969 --> 03:32:02,569
It tastes like hamburger meat.

1963
03:32:03,569 --> 03:32:05,450
Do you want Mario drug PSA?

1964
03:32:12,500 --> 03:32:18,659
Be-ah-hoo, be-ah-hoo, be-ah-hoo, whoa.

1965
03:32:18,659 --> 03:32:20,510
Hi, ladies and gentlemen.

1966
03:32:20,510 --> 03:32:22,899
I'm Super Mario.

1967
03:32:22,899 --> 03:32:24,020
We've made a lot of jokes here today.

1968
03:32:24,020 --> 03:32:25,540
We've had a lot of fun.

1969
03:32:25,540 --> 03:32:27,840
And I'm an actor.

1970
03:32:27,840 --> 03:32:29,120
But let me just be the first to tell you that,

1971
03:32:29,120 --> 03:32:30,440
you know, it's not fun.

1972
03:32:30,440 --> 03:32:36,020
What is not totally be-ah-hoo, drugs and alcohol.

1973
03:32:36,020 --> 03:32:37,299
This is by somebody in the community.

1974
03:32:37,299 --> 03:32:39,379
Are they comfortable with you sharing their name?

1975
03:32:39,379 --> 03:32:42,360
I don't wanna share their name if they're not comfortable.

1976
03:32:42,360 --> 03:32:45,239
But anyways, they discovered a new way

1977
03:32:45,239 --> 03:32:47,399
of isolating viruses that kill

1978
03:32:47,399 --> 03:32:50,280
antibiotic resistant bacteria.

1979
03:32:50,280 --> 03:32:53,780
Somebody in this community.

1980
03:32:53,780 --> 03:32:56,020
And the first one I discovered using this method,

1981
03:32:56,020 --> 03:32:58,659
I named after Germa.

1982
03:32:58,659 --> 03:33:01,100
This is apparently fucking working.

1983
03:33:01,100 --> 03:33:06,110
Against bacteria, antibiotic bacteria resistant shit.

1984
03:33:06,110 --> 03:33:07,829
That's me in there.

1985
03:33:07,829 --> 03:33:10,750
That's me taking care of that.

1986
03:33:10,750 --> 03:33:13,069
I'm in there and I'm getting all of those fucking molecules

1987
03:33:13,069 --> 03:33:14,389
and I'm destroying them.

1988
03:33:14,389 --> 03:33:15,670
Make a sandwich with wood.

1989
03:33:15,670 --> 03:33:27,409
Make a wood sandwich.

1990
03:33:28,780 --> 03:33:31,139
I can't, I can't.

1991
03:33:31,139 --> 03:33:38,379
Submit this.

1992
03:33:38,379 --> 03:33:39,540
Play for now.

1993
03:33:39,540 --> 03:33:42,420
Okay.

1994
03:33:43,750 --> 03:33:44,950
Fucking quit the goddamn game.

1995
03:33:44,950 --> 03:33:50,010
I exited the fucking game.

1996
03:33:50,010 --> 03:33:53,819
What the fuck is happening?

1997
03:33:53,819 --> 03:34:08,260
If Germa reads this, he has to do a pushup on stream.

1998
03:34:08,260 --> 03:34:19,959
I want to be so.

1999
03:34:19,959 --> 03:34:23,979
Ah!

2000
03:34:23,979 --> 03:34:26,180
Oh fuck, oh fuck.

2001
03:34:26,180 --> 03:34:30,340
If I put the ring light around your neck.

2002
03:34:30,340 --> 03:34:31,979
If I put the ring light around my neck,

2003
03:34:31,979 --> 03:34:35,420
I could actually fit.

2004
03:34:36,870 --> 03:34:38,469
That would be fucking stupid.

2005
03:34:38,469 --> 03:34:42,430
Wait a minute.

2006
03:34:50,989 --> 03:34:52,389
Nice swag, thanks.

2007
03:34:53,350 --> 03:34:57,989
I was told that if I spin a hundred times at $10,

2008
03:34:57,989 --> 03:35:00,940
starting with $1,000 on this slot machine,

2009
03:35:00,940 --> 03:35:03,860
that I will be able to get to $10,000 plus dollars.

2010
03:35:03,860 --> 03:35:05,299
There's a person in chat here who is putting

2011
03:35:05,579 --> 03:35:10,159
their stream chat life here.

2012
03:35:10,159 --> 03:35:11,399
They're going to be banned from the channel

2013
03:35:11,399 --> 03:35:13,920
if it doesn't work, or they're gonna get VIPed if it does.

2014
03:35:13,920 --> 03:35:19,719
Three, four, five.

2015
03:35:19,719 --> 03:35:23,049
Oh my God.

2016
03:35:23,049 --> 03:35:25,290
I'm so sorry.

2017
03:35:25,290 --> 03:35:27,450
Hello.

2018
03:35:27,450 --> 03:35:28,610
Yeah, and guess what?

2019
03:35:28,610 --> 03:35:29,969
You can hear me, huh?

2020
03:35:29,969 --> 03:35:31,700
You can hear me pretty well.

2021
03:35:31,700 --> 03:35:35,670
Not like it was before.

2022
03:35:35,670 --> 03:35:37,350
What the fuck, dude?

2023
03:35:37,350 --> 03:35:39,610
I'm not gonna drink a, hold on.

2024
03:35:39,610 --> 03:35:41,940
All right, hold on.

2025
03:35:41,940 --> 03:35:42,780
Let's tweet that.

2026
03:35:42,780 --> 03:35:43,860
How long is this fucking?

2027
03:35:43,899 --> 03:35:46,340
Yeah, so hopefully it sounds all right.

2028
03:35:46,340 --> 03:35:48,020
These things are pretty cool.

2029
03:35:48,020 --> 03:35:49,579
These things, let me try a scream test.

2030
03:35:49,579 --> 03:35:50,420
Can I try it?

2031
03:35:50,420 --> 03:35:51,860
Hold on.

2032
03:35:51,860 --> 03:35:52,700
Can I scream?

2033
03:35:52,700 --> 03:35:53,540
Can I scream in your ears?

2034
03:35:53,540 --> 03:35:55,659
I'm gonna scream in your ears.

2035
03:35:55,659 --> 03:35:59,079
They should fucking remove geometry from school.

2036
03:35:59,079 --> 03:36:00,520
Teach people how to do their taxes.

2037
03:36:00,520 --> 03:36:04,659
I got some soft locked?

2038
03:36:04,659 --> 03:36:05,500
How?

2039
03:36:05,500 --> 03:36:06,340
No, I'm not.

2040
03:36:06,340 --> 03:36:08,940
Someone tell Jerma I can tell them how to fix their save.

2041
03:36:08,940 --> 03:36:09,780
How do I do it?

2042
03:36:09,780 --> 03:36:10,739
How do I do it?

2043
03:36:10,739 --> 03:36:11,579
How do I do it?

2044
03:36:11,579 --> 03:36:13,219
That's so funny.

2045
03:36:13,219 --> 03:36:14,340
How do I fix my save?

2046
03:36:14,379 --> 03:36:17,260
Let's try X560Y330.

2047
03:36:17,260 --> 03:36:18,100
New tweet.

2048
03:36:18,100 --> 03:36:18,940
No, wait.

2049
03:36:18,940 --> 03:36:21,149
Z330.

2050
03:36:21,149 --> 03:36:24,430
Oh, Dev, looks like you're having a little bit of trouble

2051
03:36:24,430 --> 03:36:27,190
with geometry, aren't you?

2052
03:36:27,190 --> 03:36:28,829
Looks like the Dev is having a little bit of trouble

2053
03:36:28,829 --> 03:36:29,670
with geometry.

2054
03:36:29,670 --> 03:36:31,709
Just like, Dev, when was the last time

2055
03:36:31,709 --> 03:36:34,149
you were in fucking high school?

2056
03:36:34,149 --> 03:36:35,350
When was I?

2057
03:36:35,350 --> 03:36:37,469
I am gonna get so validated right now.

2058
03:36:37,469 --> 03:36:41,020
I suck at math.

2059
03:36:41,020 --> 03:36:41,899
I suck at math.

2060
03:36:41,899 --> 03:36:42,899
I am in my 30s.

2061
03:36:42,899 --> 03:36:44,860
I haven't had to do this for years.

2062
03:36:44,860 --> 03:36:45,899
Go look at the tweet right now.

2063
03:36:45,899 --> 03:36:47,659
I'm gonna fucking, I'm framing this.

2064
03:36:47,659 --> 03:36:50,620
I'm literally going to frame that tweet from Dusk Dev.

2065
03:36:53,180 --> 03:36:54,299
No!

2066
03:36:54,299 --> 03:36:55,940
I don't want, all right.

2067
03:36:55,940 --> 03:36:57,780
Can I just delete all the weapons

2068
03:36:57,780 --> 03:36:58,979
besides the shotgun and the,

2069
03:36:58,979 --> 03:37:01,459
I don't wanna like, oh, eh, eh, eh, eh.

2070
03:37:01,459 --> 03:37:02,420
Yes.

2071
03:37:02,420 --> 03:37:03,420
Oh, sorry, that was loud.

2072
03:37:03,420 --> 03:37:05,780
Unequip all of your weapons.

2073
03:37:05,780 --> 03:37:07,579
That is definitely the way.

2074
03:37:09,389 --> 03:37:12,829
Yes, unequip all of your weapons.

2075
03:37:12,829 --> 03:37:14,629
That is definitely the way.

2076
03:37:14,629 --> 03:37:17,190
As the voice actor for this fight making fun of me.

2077
03:37:17,350 --> 03:37:18,629
Ah!

2078
03:37:18,629 --> 03:37:20,590
Bro, that looked like Battle Chess.

2079
03:37:23,530 --> 03:37:24,770
You can turn me back on.

2080
03:37:32,629 --> 03:37:33,469
Battle Chess.

2081
03:37:35,639 --> 03:37:37,159
Oh, that's, oh my God.

2082
03:37:37,159 --> 03:37:40,360
You just ruined Dark Souls 2 for me forever.

2083
03:37:40,360 --> 03:37:43,600
You just ruined Dark, I can't even play this again.

2084
03:37:43,600 --> 03:37:45,079
Andy Funny Voices.

2085
03:37:45,079 --> 03:37:47,079
You said that wrong.

2086
03:37:47,079 --> 03:37:48,559
Andy Funny Voices.

2087
03:37:48,559 --> 03:37:49,399
No, no, no, no, no.

2088
03:37:49,399 --> 03:37:50,600
Excuse me, I gotta correct you.

2089
03:37:50,600 --> 03:37:52,959
That's Funny Voice Andy.

2090
03:37:52,959 --> 03:37:55,100
Andy Funny Voices.

2091
03:37:55,100 --> 03:37:56,219
Andy Funny Voices.

2092
03:37:56,219 --> 03:37:57,059
I love that.

2093
03:37:57,059 --> 03:37:58,700
That's my favorite comment of the week.

2094
03:37:58,700 --> 03:38:02,610
That's so, I love that wording.

2095
03:38:02,610 --> 03:38:04,409
Time that person up for five seconds.

2096
03:38:04,409 --> 03:38:08,409
If you lose, you have to get one of the gyros from Arby's.

2097
03:38:08,409 --> 03:38:10,250
I love this, this was so fun.

2098
03:38:10,250 --> 03:38:11,090
This was so fun.

2099
03:38:11,090 --> 03:38:12,770
Grossest fast food item.

2100
03:38:12,770 --> 03:38:14,610
You know what's crazy?

2101
03:38:14,610 --> 03:38:16,850
I don't want to eat fucking Arby's.

2102
03:38:16,850 --> 03:38:18,850
I don't want that at all.

2103
03:38:18,850 --> 03:38:20,329
I'm gonna try as hard as I can.

2104
03:38:20,329 --> 03:38:25,149
I'm gonna be silent now.

2105
03:38:25,149 --> 03:38:26,750
Oh shit.

2106
03:38:26,750 --> 03:38:28,750
Oh no, I wanna get Arby's.

2107
03:38:28,750 --> 03:38:34,530
I did it.

2108
03:38:34,530 --> 03:38:36,790
Sorry, Arby's fans.

2109
03:38:36,790 --> 03:38:38,190
Not tonight.

2110
03:38:38,190 --> 03:38:40,340
Causing havoc on the highway.

2111
03:38:40,340 --> 03:38:49,620
We're on break core for this.

2112
03:38:49,620 --> 03:38:51,620
Restart, restart the mission.

2113
03:38:51,620 --> 03:38:53,459
Restart the mission.

2114
03:38:53,459 --> 03:38:55,059
This is fucking with my head.

2115
03:38:55,059 --> 03:38:56,379
This is fucking with my head.

2116
03:38:56,379 --> 03:38:58,579
Imagine if the police were listening to this.

2117
03:39:09,469 --> 03:39:11,190
It's too fucked up.

2118
03:39:11,190 --> 03:39:18,469
It's too fucked up.

2119
03:39:18,469 --> 03:39:24,360
So there are a lot of funny people in this community.

2120
03:39:24,360 --> 03:39:25,639
I've known this for a long time.

2121
03:39:25,680 --> 03:39:28,159
This is not a secret.

2122
03:39:28,159 --> 03:39:31,899
The stuff that some of you guys come up with is insane.

2123
03:39:33,479 --> 03:39:36,680
I'm just sitting here watching and laughing along with you.

2124
03:39:39,329 --> 03:39:41,170
I couldn't ask for a more fun community.

2125
03:39:41,170 --> 03:39:46,100
Seriously, I love it.

2126
03:39:46,100 --> 03:39:49,100
Your winner of best one guy.

2127
03:39:49,100 --> 03:39:52,559
Remember one guy, you know who that is?

2128
03:39:52,559 --> 03:39:54,399
We all know, come on.

2129
03:39:55,780 --> 03:40:07,670
Your winner with 48.8, 49% of the vote.

2130
03:40:09,969 --> 03:40:11,370
It's Ball Fondler.

2131
03:40:11,370 --> 03:40:13,979
Of course it is.

2132
03:40:13,979 --> 03:40:15,819
Ball Fondler, congratulations,

2133
03:40:15,819 --> 03:40:19,079
you won best one guy moment of the year.

2134
03:40:19,079 --> 03:40:24,579
And then after that, 10%,

2135
03:40:24,579 --> 03:40:28,389
day one Elden Ring played at the bar.

2136
03:40:28,389 --> 03:40:30,590
And then 9%,

2137
03:40:30,590 --> 03:40:36,059
Stanley Parable Dev adds a spider into your mouth.

2138
03:40:36,059 --> 03:40:39,819
Barf Drinker, you would have had my vote, Barf Drinker.

2139
03:40:39,819 --> 03:40:44,329
You were 1.7% behind that in fourth place.

2140
03:40:44,370 --> 03:40:49,520
This was one of the most least skipped categories.

2141
03:40:49,520 --> 03:40:51,639
Congratulations Ball Fondler

2142
03:40:51,639 --> 03:40:56,420
for making an unbelievable moment of the stream.

2143
03:40:56,420 --> 03:41:00,860
Ball Fondler has been banned like three times.

2144
03:41:02,520 --> 03:41:06,120
Ball Fondler's comments since then,

2145
03:41:06,120 --> 03:41:08,690
do you know what they are?

2146
03:41:08,690 --> 03:41:11,399
Play Skyrim.

2147
03:41:11,399 --> 03:41:13,680
Okay, dude, are you gonna play Skyrim?

2148
03:41:13,680 --> 03:41:20,040
Hey, play World of Warcraft Dragon Flight.

2149
03:41:20,040 --> 03:41:24,959
Okay, I'm not gonna do probably Skyrim maybe.

2150
03:41:24,959 --> 03:41:26,559
All right, moving right along.

2151
03:41:26,559 --> 03:41:29,760
We are getting into the top seven or eight categories

2152
03:41:29,760 --> 03:41:32,399
and they're getting juicy.

2153
03:41:32,399 --> 03:41:38,739
This next one, this one's got a lot of nominees.

2154
03:41:38,739 --> 03:41:41,020
What is it?

2155
03:41:41,020 --> 03:41:43,459
Yeah, congrats Ball Fondler, you made a fun moment.

2156
03:41:46,270 --> 03:41:48,709
Best scare moment of the year.

2157
03:41:48,709 --> 03:41:52,590
Horror games, jump scares, scariness.

2158
03:41:52,590 --> 03:41:55,750
Anything that's freaked me out could be nominated.

2159
03:41:57,770 --> 03:42:10,309
Here are your nominees for best scare of the year.

2160
03:42:10,309 --> 03:42:12,510
I know, I just was doing that to freak out, you know,

2161
03:42:12,510 --> 03:42:15,309
like, you know, pity, you know what I mean?

2162
03:42:15,309 --> 03:42:16,149
Ah!

2163
03:42:18,329 --> 03:42:19,850
Hi, I'm just playing.

2164
03:42:19,850 --> 03:42:24,649
I was doing my task.

2165
03:42:24,649 --> 03:42:33,979
Ah!

2166
03:42:33,979 --> 03:42:37,739
Like, I started to like look this way

2167
03:42:37,739 --> 03:42:43,049
and this eye, this eye, I went like, I went reverse cross.

2168
03:42:43,610 --> 03:42:48,069
I went frog eye for a second.

2169
03:42:48,069 --> 03:42:51,459
Did he leave the room?

2170
03:42:51,459 --> 03:42:56,239
Holy God, this guy sucks.

2171
03:42:56,239 --> 03:43:05,690
Ah!

2172
03:43:05,690 --> 03:43:09,190
Back, but this, ah!

2173
03:43:09,190 --> 03:43:10,030
God, I'm so sorry.

2174
03:43:10,030 --> 03:43:11,790
Holy shit, that was, that was like the worst thing

2175
03:43:11,790 --> 03:43:18,680
that has ever happened to me.

2176
03:43:18,680 --> 03:43:22,479
What the flying fuck are you doing, lady?

2177
03:43:22,479 --> 03:43:23,600
I'm just going up the stairs.

2178
03:43:23,600 --> 03:43:28,899
I don't give a shit if he hears me.

2179
03:43:33,000 --> 03:43:34,520
I thought he was downstairs.

2180
03:43:36,600 --> 03:43:39,239
Oh my God, that was the worst thing ever.

2181
03:43:39,280 --> 03:43:41,040
That was probably the worst thing ever.

2182
03:43:54,370 --> 03:43:55,209
In a circle.

2183
03:43:58,420 --> 03:43:59,540
That was the chicken.

2184
03:43:59,540 --> 03:44:01,659
That was a fucking rooster.

2185
03:44:01,659 --> 03:44:02,500
That was a rooster.

2186
03:44:02,500 --> 03:44:04,100
That was actually a rooster.

2187
03:44:04,100 --> 03:44:06,260
I don't know what that means, but whatever.

2188
03:44:07,940 --> 03:44:09,620
Jesus Christ, dude.

2189
03:44:12,520 --> 03:44:14,180
Where is he?

2190
03:44:14,180 --> 03:44:15,340
Whoa!

2191
03:44:15,340 --> 03:44:18,100
Oh, the fucking thing, the drape.

2192
03:44:18,100 --> 03:44:23,899
I thought like a tentacle came down and grabbed me.

2193
03:44:23,899 --> 03:44:25,299
Fuck, dude, why?

2194
03:44:25,819 --> 03:44:28,139
I'm all cracked out now.

2195
03:44:28,139 --> 03:44:31,030
Holy shit.

2196
03:44:31,030 --> 03:44:32,229
What the fuck?

2197
03:44:32,229 --> 03:44:33,819
Ah!

2198
03:44:33,819 --> 03:44:34,899
It's like a monster.

2199
03:44:43,020 --> 03:44:43,940
It's just sound effects.

2200
03:44:43,940 --> 03:44:46,049
There's not even, nothing here.

2201
03:44:46,049 --> 03:44:47,639
There's nothing here.

2202
03:44:51,159 --> 03:45:00,090
Oh my God, it's a bat.

2203
03:45:00,090 --> 03:45:00,930
Hey!

2204
03:45:03,520 --> 03:45:05,280
Okay, I got a frying pan.

2205
03:45:05,280 --> 03:45:06,680
Oh shit.

2206
03:45:06,680 --> 03:45:08,360
I have what's it called, flash.

2207
03:45:08,360 --> 03:45:09,399
I could throw it at everyone.

2208
03:45:09,399 --> 03:45:11,280
I've got six minis.

2209
03:45:11,280 --> 03:45:12,120
Oh!

2210
03:45:12,120 --> 03:45:12,959
Run!

2211
03:45:12,959 --> 03:45:14,399
I'm sorry, I don't know how to skip this.

2212
03:45:14,399 --> 03:45:15,239
Run!

2213
03:45:15,239 --> 03:45:16,840
Oh, I went in the dumpster.

2214
03:45:16,840 --> 03:45:17,680
It's okay.

2215
03:45:19,680 --> 03:45:21,120
I thought you were getting killed.

2216
03:45:21,120 --> 03:45:22,239
No, I thought I was dead, dude.

2217
03:45:22,239 --> 03:45:23,079
I was like, what the fuck?

2218
03:45:23,079 --> 03:45:24,040
Somebody like sniped me.

2219
03:45:24,040 --> 03:45:25,040
It was terrifying.

2220
03:45:57,120 --> 03:45:58,680
That would be a fucked up start.

2221
03:45:58,680 --> 03:46:00,440
To Mickey Mouse's clubhouse.

2222
03:46:12,670 --> 03:46:18,280
Where do I go from here?

2223
03:46:18,280 --> 03:46:20,319
Okay.

2224
03:46:20,319 --> 03:46:23,639
Turn it off.

2225
03:46:23,639 --> 03:46:25,809
Turn that off.

2226
03:46:25,809 --> 03:46:28,659
Close it up.

2227
03:46:28,659 --> 03:46:37,610
What?

2228
03:46:42,500 --> 03:46:45,139
I'm wearing the same sweater too.

2229
03:46:45,139 --> 03:46:45,979
Where are the other cookies?

2230
03:46:45,979 --> 03:46:47,379
I have the same clothes on.

2231
03:46:50,389 --> 03:46:51,229
Relax.

2232
03:46:51,229 --> 03:46:52,069
Holy shit, dude.

2233
03:46:52,069 --> 03:46:52,989
Are you kidding me?

2234
03:46:52,989 --> 03:46:55,120
This is not even scary.

2235
03:46:55,120 --> 03:46:56,000
Did I just fake that?

2236
03:46:56,000 --> 03:46:56,840
No, I really didn't.

2237
03:46:56,840 --> 03:46:58,680
I swear to God, but like that was way over.

2238
03:46:58,680 --> 03:47:00,719
I've never played a scary game in a long time.

2239
03:47:12,190 --> 03:47:14,629
Oh my God, how am I alive?

2240
03:47:14,629 --> 03:47:17,430
I am absolutely, I was like, what are you pointing at?

2241
03:47:26,219 --> 03:47:28,020
Oh, it's a cliff.

2242
03:47:40,940 --> 03:47:41,780
Jesus.

2243
03:47:46,520 --> 03:47:48,200
I just shot down my computer.

2244
03:47:48,200 --> 03:47:49,959
I think I shot my computer.

2245
03:47:49,959 --> 03:47:58,020
I think I shot my computer down.

2246
03:47:58,020 --> 03:47:59,299
Wow.

2247
03:47:59,299 --> 03:48:01,729
A lot of scares this year.

2248
03:48:01,729 --> 03:48:04,799
A lot of scares.

2249
03:48:04,799 --> 03:48:07,600
I want to know what you guys picked.

2250
03:48:07,600 --> 03:48:08,840
No fanfare.

2251
03:48:08,840 --> 03:48:10,879
Let's go.

2252
03:48:10,879 --> 03:48:11,840
Yeah.

2253
03:48:12,840 --> 03:48:18,040
It technically happened last year.

2254
03:48:19,219 --> 03:48:21,579
Wearing the same clothes.

2255
03:48:21,579 --> 03:48:24,379
The volume warning puppet combo scare

2256
03:48:24,379 --> 03:48:27,059
with 20% of the vote.

2257
03:48:27,059 --> 03:48:29,700
It's the one where it looked like I saw a mouse

2258
03:48:29,700 --> 03:48:32,440
go through the bottom of the screen there.

2259
03:48:32,440 --> 03:48:34,600
Yeah, it looks like, yeah.

2260
03:48:34,600 --> 03:48:36,399
I mean, come on.

2261
03:48:36,399 --> 03:48:39,239
Charborg corner jump scare with Among Us

2262
03:48:39,239 --> 03:48:42,959
is at 13.7, number two, 13.7.

2263
03:48:43,000 --> 03:48:47,920
And then Iron Lung at 7.3%, number three.

2264
03:48:47,920 --> 03:48:51,120
I mean, the cutoff of the awards

2265
03:48:51,120 --> 03:48:54,479
was right at that puppet combo stream last year.

2266
03:48:54,479 --> 03:48:58,200
So, honestly, I think a couple of years

2267
03:48:58,200 --> 03:48:59,639
came off my life after that.

2268
03:49:00,600 --> 03:49:04,190
I felt awful after that stream.

2269
03:49:04,190 --> 03:49:07,149
I think I remember talking about it later,

2270
03:49:07,149 --> 03:49:10,190
being like, I feel bad, I feel awful.

2271
03:49:10,190 --> 03:49:12,350
I have a headache, my chest hurts.

2272
03:49:12,350 --> 03:49:14,229
It actually felt terrible after that.

2273
03:49:15,350 --> 03:49:19,549
Anyways, we are getting to the final seven awards.

2274
03:49:19,549 --> 03:49:21,590
This is getting juicy.

2275
03:49:21,590 --> 03:49:24,840
I've said that four or five times, but it is.

2276
03:49:24,840 --> 03:49:29,530
Time to get to the big ones.

2277
03:49:29,530 --> 03:49:34,049
Now, every year, I like to sing some songs.

2278
03:49:34,930 --> 03:49:39,930
I sing, I get involved, I enunciate,

2279
03:49:40,329 --> 03:49:43,620
and we are going to show you now

2280
03:49:43,620 --> 03:49:46,940
some of those nominees for what that means when it's good.

2281
03:49:46,940 --> 03:49:49,840
Not bad when it's good.

2282
03:49:49,840 --> 03:49:54,840
Here are your nominees for the best singing of the year.

2283
03:50:00,180 --> 03:50:05,280
Hopefully it's good, because I haven't seen this.

2284
03:50:05,280 --> 03:50:06,799
Boop beep, boop beep, boop beep, boop.

2285
03:50:06,799 --> 03:50:10,840
Boop beep, boop beep, boop, boop beep, boop.

2286
03:50:10,840 --> 03:50:14,219
You got a friend in me.

2287
03:50:14,219 --> 03:50:15,059
This is on the other one, too.

2288
03:50:15,059 --> 03:50:15,899
This is on the worst singing back.

2289
03:50:15,899 --> 03:50:17,819
You got a friend in me.

2290
03:50:20,319 --> 03:50:23,920
When the road looks rubberhead,

2291
03:50:23,920 --> 03:50:28,639
and you're miles and miles from your nice, warm bed,

2292
03:50:29,940 --> 03:50:33,579
you just remember what your old pal said.

2293
03:50:33,579 --> 03:50:37,819
Boy, you got a friend in me.

2294
03:50:37,819 --> 03:50:41,110
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

2295
03:50:41,110 --> 03:51:01,569
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

2296
03:51:01,569 --> 03:51:06,569
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2297
03:51:06,610 --> 03:51:07,969
Oh, you're playing Dark Souls?

2298
03:51:07,969 --> 03:51:10,969
Hey, son, what a game you're playing.

2299
03:51:10,969 --> 03:51:14,690
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2300
03:51:14,690 --> 03:51:16,370
Oh, I wonder.

2301
03:51:16,370 --> 03:51:19,729
The only thing I remember from Arcane was...

2302
03:51:19,729 --> 03:51:22,010
Oh, the misery.

2303
03:51:22,010 --> 03:51:25,389
Every single person is my enemy.

2304
03:51:25,389 --> 03:51:26,629
That's the only thing I know.

2305
03:51:26,629 --> 03:51:33,420
I don't know anything else.

2306
03:51:33,420 --> 03:51:36,139
You gotta find that mystery.

2307
03:51:36,139 --> 03:51:39,379
This is Scooby-Doo, coming after you.

2308
03:51:39,379 --> 03:51:41,459
Look, it's Scooby-Doo.

2309
03:51:41,459 --> 03:51:42,940
This is the fucking new Zoomer shit.

2310
03:51:42,940 --> 03:51:44,340
This is not what I wanted.

2311
03:51:47,819 --> 03:51:49,620
To the streets.

2312
03:51:49,620 --> 03:51:51,739
Got me up the cigarette,

2313
03:51:51,739 --> 03:51:53,739
cause that step shoe's on my feet.

2314
03:51:54,860 --> 03:51:57,059
Need to find a reason,

2315
03:51:57,059 --> 03:51:59,579
reason things went wrong.

2316
03:51:59,579 --> 03:52:03,780
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone.

2317
03:52:03,780 --> 03:52:04,620
Oh!

2318
03:52:07,180 --> 03:52:09,500
I could still get high,

2319
03:52:09,500 --> 03:52:11,500
and I can play the guitar

2320
03:52:11,500 --> 03:52:14,020
like a motherfucking riot.

2321
03:52:16,500 --> 03:52:17,979
Not this one, I hope not.

2322
03:52:39,309 --> 03:52:41,750
Scared?

2323
03:52:41,750 --> 03:52:44,979
That's what you want.

2324
03:52:44,979 --> 03:52:46,979
I'm gonna march out here and just start singing

2325
03:52:46,979 --> 03:52:54,340
fucking John Jingleheimer Schmidt.

2326
03:52:54,340 --> 03:52:55,180
What are you doing now?

2327
03:52:55,180 --> 03:52:57,149
You're supposed to be scared.

2328
03:52:57,149 --> 03:53:00,469
John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt.

2329
03:53:00,469 --> 03:53:03,469
His name is my name too.

2330
03:53:03,469 --> 03:53:04,309
That's bad.

2331
03:53:04,309 --> 03:53:05,950
Whenever we go out,

2332
03:53:05,989 --> 03:53:07,030
we always shout,

2333
03:53:07,030 --> 03:53:10,069
here comes John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt.

2334
03:53:10,069 --> 03:53:11,389
Why is this, is this in the other one too?

2335
03:53:11,389 --> 03:53:12,790
I'm gonna go to the bathroom quick.

2336
03:53:12,790 --> 03:53:13,629
This is terrible.

2337
03:53:13,629 --> 03:53:17,379
Sing, chat, a la la la.

2338
03:53:17,379 --> 03:53:18,500
Little baby don't say a word,

2339
03:53:18,500 --> 03:53:19,620
I'm gonna buy you a mockingbird.

2340
03:53:19,620 --> 03:53:20,780
If that mockingbird don't sing,

2341
03:53:20,780 --> 03:53:21,819
I'm gonna buy you an ironing.

2342
03:53:21,819 --> 03:53:22,979
If that diamond ring don't shine,

2343
03:53:22,979 --> 03:53:28,959
I'm gonna buy you a glass of wine.

2344
03:53:28,959 --> 03:53:31,340
When you get old enough, over 21.

2345
03:53:31,340 --> 03:53:34,520
We get an apples and bananas remix?

2346
03:53:34,520 --> 03:53:36,000
Are you talking about like the,

2347
03:53:36,000 --> 03:53:39,120
I want to eat, eat, eat,

2348
03:53:39,120 --> 03:53:40,799
apples and bananas.

2349
03:53:40,799 --> 03:53:41,879
That's what you mean?

2350
03:53:41,879 --> 03:53:44,479
I'd like to eat, eat, eat,

2351
03:53:44,479 --> 03:53:45,879
apples and bananas.

2352
03:53:47,250 --> 03:53:51,049
And feel like I belong.

2353
03:53:51,049 --> 03:53:51,889
All right, give up.

2354
03:53:51,889 --> 03:53:52,729
This one's good.

2355
03:53:52,729 --> 03:53:57,520
Way, I can go the distance.

2356
03:53:57,520 --> 03:54:01,040
I'll be there someday.

2357
03:54:01,040 --> 03:54:04,159
If I can be strong,

2358
03:54:04,159 --> 03:54:07,559
I know every mile

2359
03:54:07,559 --> 03:54:12,530
will be worth my while.

2360
03:54:12,530 --> 03:54:16,450
I would go most anywhere

2361
03:54:16,450 --> 03:54:28,709
to feel like I belong.

2362
03:54:28,709 --> 03:54:31,459
Well, I liked that last one.

2363
03:54:31,459 --> 03:54:33,299
That was pretty good.

2364
03:54:33,299 --> 03:54:35,379
Brother, we'll see what you think.

2365
03:54:35,379 --> 03:54:36,219
Ladies and gentlemen,

2366
03:54:36,219 --> 03:54:39,219
the winner of best singing of the year is,

2367
03:54:41,819 --> 03:54:43,940
I don't know if production has it ready,

2368
03:54:43,940 --> 03:54:46,860
but I'll just wait till you do.

2369
03:54:46,860 --> 03:54:48,739
Can we just play?

2370
03:54:48,739 --> 03:54:50,459
Can we just play it?

2371
03:54:50,459 --> 03:54:53,170
Can we just play it?

2372
03:54:53,170 --> 03:54:54,450
Do you know what won?

2373
03:54:54,450 --> 03:54:55,409
Can we just play it?

2374
03:54:55,409 --> 03:54:57,489
DMCA, no, the channel will get shut down,

2375
03:54:57,489 --> 03:55:00,610
but who gives a shit?

2376
03:55:00,610 --> 03:55:01,969
They don't have it.

2377
03:55:01,969 --> 03:55:06,969
Okay, it's with 31.1%, 31% of the vote is,

2378
03:55:08,409 --> 03:55:10,129
oh, the misery.

2379
03:55:12,489 --> 03:55:13,729
Okay.

2380
03:55:13,729 --> 03:55:16,170
At number two with 25%,

2381
03:55:16,170 --> 03:55:18,930
all the Hatsune Miku fans, po-pi-po.

2382
03:55:18,930 --> 03:55:20,610
And then Hercules, go the distance,

2383
03:55:20,610 --> 03:55:22,569
which was actually the good one.

2384
03:55:22,569 --> 03:55:24,450
That was the good one.

2385
03:55:24,450 --> 03:55:27,129
At 9.85%, good job, by the way.

2386
03:55:27,129 --> 03:55:28,649
Good job.

2387
03:55:28,649 --> 03:55:30,049
There you go.

2388
03:55:30,049 --> 03:55:33,290
But now, I do want to do something very special.

2389
03:55:34,329 --> 03:55:36,090
We saw them earlier.

2390
03:55:36,090 --> 03:55:38,690
Didn't really get a chance to show off

2391
03:55:38,690 --> 03:55:40,489
what they could actually do.

2392
03:55:40,489 --> 03:55:42,850
Feel like it's a good place to do it, though.

2393
03:55:42,850 --> 03:55:47,010
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome back into the studio,

2394
03:55:47,010 --> 03:55:48,450
Top Shelt Vocal,

2395
03:55:52,659 --> 03:55:55,059
full of actual good songs here.

2396
03:55:55,059 --> 03:55:56,180
And I'm gonna get out of here

2397
03:55:56,180 --> 03:55:58,299
because I shouldn't be here.

2398
03:55:58,299 --> 03:56:00,459
Santa did tell me to be better.

2399
03:56:00,459 --> 03:56:02,940
Top Shelt Vocal, ladies and gentlemen,

2400
03:56:02,940 --> 03:56:12,489
with a couple of songs.

2401
03:56:12,489 --> 03:56:17,049
Joy to the world, the Lord is come.

2402
03:56:17,049 --> 03:56:21,569
Let earth receive her King.

2403
03:56:21,569 --> 03:56:26,209
Let every heart prepare him room.

2404
03:56:26,209 --> 03:56:27,329
And heaven and nature sing.

2405
03:56:27,329 --> 03:56:28,329
And heaven and nature sing.

2406
03:56:28,329 --> 03:56:29,329
And heaven and nature sing.

2407
03:56:29,329 --> 03:56:30,329
And heaven and nature sing.

2408
03:56:30,329 --> 03:56:31,329
And heaven and nature sing.

2409
03:56:32,329 --> 03:56:35,290
And heaven and nature sing.

2410
03:56:35,290 --> 03:56:39,329
Joy to the earth, the Savior reigns.

2411
03:56:39,329 --> 03:56:43,809
Let men their songs employ.

2412
03:56:43,809 --> 03:56:48,209
Rock fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains.

2413
03:56:48,209 --> 03:56:50,209
Repeat the sounding joy.

2414
03:56:50,209 --> 03:56:51,889
Repeat the sounding joy.

2415
03:56:51,889 --> 03:56:54,129
Repeat the sounding joy.

2416
03:56:54,129 --> 03:56:56,049
Repeat the sounding joy.

2417
03:56:56,049 --> 03:56:57,290
Repeat the sounding joy.

2418
03:56:57,290 --> 03:57:01,290
He rules the world with truth and grace.

2419
03:57:01,290 --> 03:57:05,090
and makes the nations prove

2420
03:57:05,090 --> 03:57:10,049
the glories of His righteousness

2421
03:57:10,049 --> 03:57:12,250
and wonders of His love

2422
03:57:12,250 --> 03:57:14,450
and wonders of His love

2423
03:57:14,450 --> 03:57:21,250
and wonders, wonders of His love.

2424
03:57:21,250 --> 03:57:28,239
Thank you. Thank you so much for bringing us back.

2425
03:57:28,239 --> 03:57:31,430
For bringing some joy to the world.

2426
03:57:31,430 --> 03:57:33,780
We're gonna slow it down just a little bit

2427
03:57:33,780 --> 03:57:39,649
because tonight, we want to bring in a holy night.

2428
03:57:40,649 --> 03:57:57,079
O holy night, the stars are brightly shining

2429
03:57:57,079 --> 03:58:06,180
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth

2430
03:58:06,180 --> 03:58:14,780
Long lay the world in sin and error pining

2431
03:58:14,979 --> 03:58:23,680
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth

2432
03:58:23,680 --> 03:58:31,680
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices

2433
03:58:31,680 --> 03:58:39,680
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

2434
03:58:39,680 --> 03:58:47,280
Fall on your knees

2435
03:58:47,280 --> 03:58:55,079
O hear the angel voices

2436
03:58:55,079 --> 03:59:02,440
O night divine

2437
03:59:02,440 --> 03:59:10,600
O night when Christ was born

2438
03:59:10,600 --> 03:59:21,780
O night, O holy night

2439
03:59:21,780 --> 03:59:27,979
O night divine

2440
03:59:27,979 --> 03:59:33,629
Thank you all so much.

2441
03:59:33,629 --> 03:59:34,829
Thank you. Yeah.

2442
03:59:34,829 --> 03:59:36,229
Happy holidays to all.

2443
03:59:36,229 --> 03:59:37,629
Thank you. Yeah, thank you for having us.

2444
03:59:37,629 --> 03:59:38,430
Thank you for having us.

2445
03:59:38,430 --> 03:59:39,430
Appreciate it.

2446
03:59:39,430 --> 03:59:41,430
That was absolutely unbelievable.

2447
03:59:41,430 --> 03:59:42,629
Thank you. Thank you.

2448
03:59:42,629 --> 03:59:46,229
You all out here to actually do a song.

2449
03:59:46,430 --> 03:59:49,829
So with that, now don't listen.

2450
03:59:49,829 --> 03:59:52,229
I don't want you guys to don't listen to this.

2451
03:59:52,229 --> 03:59:53,629
We're going to go to the next category,

2452
03:59:53,629 --> 03:59:57,629
which is maybe the worst singing of the year.

2453
03:59:57,629 --> 03:59:58,829
Maybe.

2454
03:59:58,829 --> 04:00:02,430
I sing, you've heard me, I've sung before a few times.

2455
04:00:02,430 --> 04:00:04,430
A couple times, yeah.

2456
04:00:04,430 --> 04:00:08,629
Here are your nominees for the worst singing of the year.

2457
04:00:08,629 --> 04:00:11,030
Right after that great performance.

2458
04:00:11,030 --> 04:00:15,520
You guys killed it.

2459
04:00:15,520 --> 04:00:17,319
That was fucking amazing.

2460
04:00:24,739 --> 04:00:26,340
Somebody said Björk?

2461
04:00:26,340 --> 04:00:30,909
What do you mean Björk?

2462
04:00:30,909 --> 04:00:32,709
I don't sound like Björk.

2463
04:00:32,709 --> 04:00:33,909
What do you mean?

2464
04:00:33,909 --> 04:00:36,520
All I think is like...

2465
04:00:43,709 --> 04:00:47,440
And then somebody says Björk and I'm like fuck.

2466
04:00:59,899 --> 04:01:01,930
That's how you can punch to the face.

2467
04:01:02,729 --> 04:01:12,219
All good friends and we all get together sometimes

2468
04:01:12,219 --> 04:01:15,020
When you're feeling down and you're feeling out of luck

2469
04:01:15,020 --> 04:01:16,819
And out of change

2470
04:01:16,819 --> 04:01:19,219
We will work together and we will have...

2471
04:01:19,219 --> 04:01:20,219
I'm sorry.

2472
04:01:20,219 --> 04:01:21,620
That's what I expected.

2473
04:01:21,620 --> 04:01:22,620
That's what I expected.

2474
04:01:22,620 --> 04:01:24,219
I expected that.

2475
04:01:24,219 --> 04:01:26,020
She's such a misfit

2476
04:01:26,020 --> 04:01:27,420
Always ready to fight

2477
04:01:27,420 --> 04:01:29,219
She's got a super beam

2478
04:01:29,219 --> 04:01:31,020
And she's raising high

2479
04:01:31,020 --> 04:01:35,459
If you believe you're strong

2480
04:01:35,459 --> 04:01:36,860
So you know the whole song?

2481
04:01:36,860 --> 04:01:37,860
I don't know.

2482
04:01:37,860 --> 04:01:39,860
I heard like a minute of it.

2483
04:01:39,860 --> 04:01:49,879
I think a good night song for Boba.

2484
04:01:49,879 --> 04:01:53,879
Boba, the kitty

2485
04:01:53,879 --> 04:01:56,479
Have a good rest

2486
04:01:56,479 --> 04:02:00,219
See you in the morning

2487
04:02:00,219 --> 04:02:05,510
Boba, such a good kitty

2488
04:02:05,510 --> 04:02:08,670
See you in the morning

2489
04:02:08,670 --> 04:02:10,069
Good morning, good morning

2490
04:02:10,069 --> 04:02:11,469
Good morning to you all

2491
04:02:11,469 --> 04:02:13,670
Good morning, good morning

2492
04:02:13,670 --> 04:02:15,959
I'm gonna take a fall

2493
04:02:15,959 --> 04:02:20,420
It's such a wonderful world we live in, in this nice street.

2494
04:02:20,420 --> 04:02:22,020
We're almost there. Here we are.

2495
04:02:22,020 --> 04:02:25,239
Oh, the misery

2496
04:02:25,239 --> 04:02:29,239
Every, every, my, every single person is my enemy.

2497
04:02:31,700 --> 04:02:33,100
Here it goes, here it goes.

2498
04:02:33,100 --> 04:02:35,700
We go from Nashville to Norway

2499
04:02:35,700 --> 04:02:40,899
To Zimbabwe, to Chicago, to Czechoslovakia

2500
04:02:40,899 --> 04:02:41,899
And back

2501
04:02:41,899 --> 04:02:43,899
But she'll

2502
04:02:45,899 --> 04:02:47,899
Fucking god damn it

2503
04:02:47,899 --> 04:02:51,840
The weather outside is bright

2504
04:02:51,840 --> 04:02:52,840
What's wrong with this?

2505
04:02:52,840 --> 04:02:56,979
I got fire and solar light

2506
04:02:56,979 --> 04:02:59,979
Since we, since we no place

2507
04:02:59,979 --> 04:03:00,979
Hold on

2508
04:03:00,979 --> 04:03:02,979
Since we no place

2509
04:03:02,979 --> 04:03:05,280
I'll get it. Shut up.

2510
04:03:05,280 --> 04:03:08,280
Since we no place to go

2511
04:03:08,280 --> 04:03:11,280
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

2512
04:03:11,280 --> 04:03:13,280
Use that part.

2513
04:03:13,280 --> 04:03:16,860
What's wrong with that? That was fine.

2514
04:03:16,860 --> 04:03:19,860
You've got a friend in me

2515
04:03:19,860 --> 04:03:22,489
Got a friend in me

2516
04:03:22,489 --> 04:03:25,100
Two people

2517
04:03:25,100 --> 04:03:28,100
Having more of a laugh than I have

2518
04:03:28,100 --> 04:03:30,100
That's it, right?

2519
04:03:31,100 --> 04:03:33,100
Alright, I'm gonna count you guys in, okay?

2520
04:03:33,100 --> 04:03:35,100
3, 2, 1, go

2521
04:03:35,100 --> 04:03:38,100
She sang over the hills

2522
04:03:38,100 --> 04:03:42,100
It instantly voice jammered me

2523
04:03:43,100 --> 04:03:44,100
Take your headphones out

2524
04:03:44,100 --> 04:03:46,100
Wait, wait, wait, sorry, sorry, sorry

2525
04:03:46,100 --> 04:03:47,100
Take out your headphones

2526
04:03:47,100 --> 04:03:48,100
Okay

2527
04:03:48,100 --> 04:03:49,100
Ready?

2528
04:03:49,100 --> 04:03:51,100
3, 2, 1

2529
04:03:51,100 --> 04:03:53,100
She sang over the hills

2530
04:03:53,100 --> 04:03:56,100
Peaks a shy but sure dawn

2531
04:03:56,100 --> 04:03:58,100
And sure as the sun rise

2532
04:03:58,100 --> 04:04:00,100
I'll someday be gone

2533
04:04:00,100 --> 04:04:02,100
But recall me my love

2534
04:04:02,100 --> 04:04:05,100
And our joy may live on

2535
04:04:05,100 --> 04:04:09,100
And you do, and you do, and you do

2536
04:04:09,100 --> 04:04:12,360
That's a howl at the end, that has to be a howl at the end

2537
04:04:13,360 --> 04:04:24,049
Some of those weren't that bad

2538
04:04:24,049 --> 04:04:29,270
I mean, cringe, is it like a most cringe category?

2539
04:04:29,270 --> 04:04:31,270
Maybe, no

2540
04:04:31,270 --> 04:04:34,729
I have to top shell vocal, I don't

2541
04:04:34,729 --> 04:04:42,469
These were close

2542
04:04:43,469 --> 04:04:46,219
It was pretty much every single nominee

2543
04:04:46,219 --> 04:04:53,590
15.5, 14.4, 13.9, 13, 12

2544
04:04:53,590 --> 04:04:56,590
It's all of them, you couldn't choose

2545
04:04:56,590 --> 04:05:00,770
But if you had to, with 15.5% of the vote, it's Bjork

2546
04:05:00,770 --> 04:05:03,389
Bjork wins

2547
04:05:03,389 --> 04:05:07,389
And then right underneath that 14.4%

2548
04:05:07,389 --> 04:05:10,819
Was Beatbox Oh the Misery

2549
04:05:10,819 --> 04:05:16,819
And then 13.9% was the Splatoon 3 Laughing Song

2550
04:05:16,819 --> 04:05:23,620
I mean, the Bjork

2551
04:05:23,620 --> 04:05:27,620
That stream I would have nominated for worst stream of the year

2552
04:05:27,620 --> 04:05:30,549
Is it in there?

2553
04:05:30,549 --> 04:05:31,549
It might be

2554
04:05:31,549 --> 04:05:34,370
Alright, let's count the categories

2555
04:05:34,370 --> 04:05:38,370
Count the categories, we've got one, two, three, four, five

2556
04:05:38,370 --> 04:05:40,370
We've got, what, five or six categories remaining?

2557
04:05:40,370 --> 04:05:42,370
These are the huge ones

2558
04:05:42,370 --> 04:05:45,610
These are the major, massive categories

2559
04:05:45,610 --> 04:05:49,819
Are you ready?

2560
04:05:49,819 --> 04:05:50,819
How you guys feel?

2561
04:05:50,819 --> 04:05:52,819
You guys in the Christmas spirit?

2562
04:05:52,819 --> 04:05:53,819
Holiday spirit?

2563
04:05:53,819 --> 04:05:56,020
Yeah?

2564
04:05:56,020 --> 04:05:59,139
Can you please do a Bjork?

2565
04:05:59,139 --> 04:06:03,379
Yeah

2566
04:06:07,379 --> 04:06:09,329
Pretty good

2567
04:06:09,329 --> 04:06:11,340
Pretty good

2568
04:06:11,340 --> 04:06:13,469
I tried

2569
04:06:13,469 --> 04:06:17,379
Bjork is a very talented singer, by the way

2570
04:06:17,379 --> 04:06:19,680
More talented than I will ever be

2571
04:06:19,680 --> 04:06:21,920
Times 100

2572
04:06:21,920 --> 04:06:23,219
Just make that clear

2573
04:06:23,219 --> 04:06:25,219
I have nothing on Bjork

2574
04:06:25,219 --> 04:06:26,219
Zero

2575
04:06:26,219 --> 04:06:32,010
What's that say?

2576
04:06:32,010 --> 04:06:37,270
That is best gamer moment of the year

2577
04:06:37,270 --> 04:06:39,450
Did I do good in a game?

2578
04:06:39,450 --> 04:06:41,450
Did I play Call of Duty versus a hacker?

2579
04:06:41,450 --> 04:06:45,579
Who may have been cheating, we don't know

2580
04:06:45,579 --> 04:06:49,590
See him for lunch or dinner on Friday

2581
04:06:49,590 --> 04:06:52,540
Extinguisher, if you still hear me

2582
04:06:52,540 --> 04:06:56,500
I like extra lettuce on my hamburgers

2583
04:06:56,500 --> 04:06:58,500
I like crunch

2584
04:06:58,500 --> 04:07:01,450
Best gamer moment of the year incoming

2585
04:07:01,450 --> 04:07:04,450
These are the moments that I actually did very well

2586
04:07:04,450 --> 04:07:06,940
Not this one

2587
04:07:06,940 --> 04:07:07,940
Don't look at that one yet

2588
04:07:07,940 --> 04:07:08,940
It's not time for that one

2589
04:07:08,940 --> 04:07:10,940
We're going to put that down

2590
04:07:10,940 --> 04:07:11,940
And we're going to show you the nominees

2591
04:07:11,940 --> 04:07:15,940
For best gaming moment of the year

2592
04:07:15,940 --> 04:07:17,940
This is when I did well

2593
04:07:17,940 --> 04:07:21,020
Here are your nominees

2594
04:07:21,020 --> 04:07:24,729
Somebody's probably actually insane

2595
04:07:24,729 --> 04:07:26,729
Ban that person for an hour

2596
04:07:26,729 --> 04:07:31,659
And then you bet a little bit there

2597
04:07:31,659 --> 04:07:33,659
And then maybe I'd be like

2598
04:07:33,659 --> 04:07:36,659
What's 50 more?

2599
04:07:36,659 --> 04:07:37,659
You know what I mean?

2600
04:07:37,659 --> 04:07:39,659
It's a nominal amount

2601
04:07:39,659 --> 04:07:42,659
Somebody said Elmo

2602
04:07:42,659 --> 04:07:45,469
What does that mean?

2603
04:07:45,469 --> 04:07:49,649
Jerma, you absolute idiot

2604
04:07:49,649 --> 04:07:50,649
Am I stupid?

2605
04:07:50,649 --> 04:07:57,559
Because I just won the game

2606
04:07:57,559 --> 04:08:00,059
That's a three of a kind

2607
04:08:00,059 --> 04:08:11,059
You just got shot

2608
04:08:11,059 --> 04:08:12,059
Were you here?

2609
04:08:12,059 --> 04:08:13,059
Were you in the room?

2610
04:08:13,059 --> 04:08:15,370
Were you in the fucking room?

2611
04:08:15,370 --> 04:08:16,610
I got a bet for you

2612
04:08:16,610 --> 04:08:19,909
And I complete my own mini golf course

2613
04:08:19,909 --> 04:08:23,540
In less than 20 strokes

2614
04:08:23,540 --> 04:08:24,540
Six

2615
04:08:24,540 --> 04:08:28,989
And seven

2616
04:08:28,989 --> 04:08:30,989
Here comes seven

2617
04:08:30,989 --> 04:08:31,989
Motherfuckers, you didn't think

2618
04:08:31,989 --> 04:08:34,989
I was going to skip the whole goddamn course?

2619
04:08:34,989 --> 04:08:46,149
Yes!

2620
04:08:46,149 --> 04:08:49,149
You all lose

2621
04:08:49,149 --> 04:08:52,149
Never bet against me again

2622
04:08:52,149 --> 04:08:53,149
What's happening?

2623
04:08:53,149 --> 04:08:55,969
Am I winning?

2624
04:08:55,969 --> 04:08:57,969
Am I beating them?

2625
04:08:57,969 --> 04:08:58,969
I don't know

2626
04:08:58,969 --> 04:09:12,840
Did I win?

2627
04:09:12,840 --> 04:09:17,770
Why won't he fight me?

2628
04:09:17,770 --> 04:09:18,770
Hurry up, run

2629
04:09:18,770 --> 04:09:21,670
God damn it

2630
04:09:21,670 --> 04:09:25,770
I knew it was a problem

2631
04:09:25,770 --> 04:09:26,770
I have to be off to this guy

2632
04:09:26,770 --> 04:09:28,770
Before he rings the alarm

2633
04:09:28,770 --> 04:09:38,350
Fuck, come on

2634
04:09:38,350 --> 04:09:40,350
Why is he so much faster than me?

2635
04:09:40,350 --> 04:09:46,520
I got him

2636
04:09:46,520 --> 04:09:58,579
I beat him

2637
04:09:58,579 --> 04:10:07,600
These are pretty good moments

2638
04:10:07,600 --> 04:10:10,420
That game is so hard

2639
04:10:10,420 --> 04:10:13,100
They made it too hard

2640
04:10:13,100 --> 04:10:15,100
Ultra kill devs if you're watching

2641
04:10:15,100 --> 04:10:18,860
Your game is too hard

2642
04:10:18,860 --> 04:10:20,860
The hardest game at Walmart

2643
04:10:20,860 --> 04:10:22,860
It's not even at Walmart

2644
04:10:22,860 --> 04:10:25,870
No, that's an old callback

2645
04:10:25,870 --> 04:10:26,870
The game is hard

2646
04:10:26,870 --> 04:10:27,870
Just to let you know

2647
04:10:27,870 --> 04:10:28,870
Anyways, ladies and gentlemen

2648
04:10:28,870 --> 04:10:36,540
The winner of best gamer moment of the year is

2649
04:10:36,540 --> 04:10:39,680
This was huge

2650
04:10:39,680 --> 04:10:42,680
44.6%

2651
04:10:42,680 --> 04:10:45,860
Almost 45% of the vote

2652
04:10:45,860 --> 04:10:48,860
The ultimate poker bluff versus Ludwig

2653
04:10:48,860 --> 04:10:50,860
Wins

2654
04:10:50,860 --> 04:10:52,159
Come on

2655
04:10:52,159 --> 04:10:54,159
He took all his money

2656
04:10:54,159 --> 04:10:55,159
He's here somewhere

2657
04:10:55,159 --> 04:10:56,159
He's back there somewhere

2658
04:10:56,159 --> 04:10:58,159
Sorry Ludwig

2659
04:10:58,159 --> 04:10:59,340
Beachy and poker

2660
04:10:59,340 --> 04:11:01,340
It's my game

2661
04:11:01,340 --> 04:11:02,510
And then after the first try

2662
04:11:02,510 --> 04:11:04,510
Cuphead DLC boss at what?

2663
04:11:04,510 --> 04:11:06,510
14.8%

2664
04:11:06,510 --> 04:11:09,010
That's not even close

2665
04:11:09,010 --> 04:11:10,309
And then beating

2666
04:11:10,309 --> 04:11:13,309
Ulcerated tree spirit early

2667
04:11:13,309 --> 04:11:15,309
That was so impressive

2668
04:11:15,309 --> 04:11:16,309
You beat the tree spirit

2669
04:11:16,309 --> 04:11:17,309
Who cares?

2670
04:11:17,309 --> 04:11:19,309
That was like 30 levels too early

2671
04:11:19,309 --> 04:11:22,309
I accidentally walked into that boss

2672
04:11:22,309 --> 04:11:24,489
So that's pretty impressive

2673
04:11:24,489 --> 04:11:25,489
I think

2674
04:11:25,489 --> 04:11:28,110
So there you go

2675
04:11:28,110 --> 04:11:29,110
Weirdly enough

2676
04:11:29,110 --> 04:11:31,110
The mini golf course

2677
04:11:31,110 --> 04:11:33,290
Was fourth or fifth place

2678
04:11:33,290 --> 04:11:36,780
People thought the Ludwig bluff was way better

2679
04:11:36,780 --> 04:11:37,780
And just like the good

2680
04:11:37,780 --> 04:11:39,780
There's also the bad

2681
04:11:39,780 --> 04:11:43,819
I don't remember these nominees

2682
04:11:43,819 --> 04:11:47,059
But they were way more than best

2683
04:11:47,059 --> 04:11:49,360
I think they were

2684
04:11:49,360 --> 04:11:50,360
We had to narrow it down

2685
04:11:50,360 --> 04:11:51,360
Because I think they were like

2686
04:11:51,360 --> 04:11:52,360
Oh wow

2687
04:11:52,360 --> 04:11:53,360
We had like seven nominees

2688
04:11:53,360 --> 04:11:55,360
For best gamer moment

2689
04:11:55,360 --> 04:11:58,360
And 70 for worst gamer moment

2690
04:11:58,360 --> 04:12:00,360
So we really had to narrow this down

2691
04:12:00,360 --> 04:12:01,360
Honestly

2692
04:12:01,360 --> 04:12:02,360
I don't even know what's on this list

2693
04:12:02,360 --> 04:12:03,360
I haven't seen it

2694
04:12:03,360 --> 04:12:05,360
I just knew we did a few passes on it

2695
04:12:05,360 --> 04:12:07,360
Because we had to

2696
04:12:07,360 --> 04:12:08,360
So here are your nominees

2697
04:12:08,360 --> 04:12:10,360
For just like best gamer moment

2698
04:12:10,360 --> 04:12:12,360
Here is the worst gamer moment

2699
04:12:12,360 --> 04:12:13,360
Of the entire year

2700
04:12:13,360 --> 04:12:15,360
Worst gamer moment

2701
04:12:15,360 --> 04:12:22,180
This is a nine minute category by the way

2702
04:12:22,180 --> 04:12:23,180
So strap in

2703
04:12:23,180 --> 04:12:24,180
And fire

2704
04:12:24,180 --> 04:12:25,180
Jesus

2705
04:12:25,180 --> 04:12:30,510
Give fire to the tornado

2706
04:12:30,510 --> 04:12:33,510
Bro there ain't no tornado on the screen

2707
04:12:33,510 --> 04:12:35,510
Hand the fire to the tornado

2708
04:12:35,510 --> 04:12:38,329
But do it quietly

2709
04:12:38,329 --> 04:12:40,329
Orc Minecraft fire

2710
04:12:40,329 --> 04:12:41,819
Me

2711
04:12:41,819 --> 04:12:43,819
Me build dirt house

2712
04:12:43,819 --> 04:12:45,819
And burn it

2713
04:12:45,819 --> 04:12:47,129
Is

2714
04:12:47,129 --> 04:12:48,129
You ten

2715
04:12:48,129 --> 04:12:49,129
If

2716
04:12:49,129 --> 04:12:50,129
None of these work

2717
04:12:50,129 --> 04:12:52,430
Eftensib

2718
04:12:52,430 --> 04:12:54,799
Eftensib

2719
04:12:54,799 --> 04:12:56,299
Ecten

2720
04:12:56,299 --> 04:12:57,299
Eltens

2721
04:12:57,299 --> 04:12:58,299
Eltens

2722
04:12:58,299 --> 04:12:59,600
Elt

2723
04:12:59,600 --> 04:13:00,600
Elten

2724
04:13:00,600 --> 04:13:02,600
What is this word man?

2725
04:13:02,600 --> 04:13:05,600
What is this word?

2726
04:13:05,600 --> 04:13:07,600
Contestant number two

2727
04:13:07,600 --> 04:13:09,600
Extensible

2728
04:13:09,600 --> 04:13:11,600
Extensive background

2729
04:13:15,350 --> 04:13:17,659
Shit there's a flag right there

2730
04:13:17,659 --> 04:13:18,659
What is it?

2731
04:13:18,659 --> 04:13:21,659
Oh my god

2732
04:13:21,659 --> 04:13:24,659
It's Switzerland

2733
04:13:24,659 --> 04:13:26,659
What?

2734
04:13:29,950 --> 04:13:35,290
Excuse me?

2735
04:13:35,290 --> 04:13:37,719
Why is this thing coming alive?

2736
04:13:37,719 --> 04:13:41,690
Stone talus

2737
04:13:41,690 --> 04:13:45,780
I'm fucking dead

2738
04:13:59,770 --> 04:14:01,770
It's gonna do a lot of damage

2739
04:14:01,770 --> 04:14:02,770
Yeah it's gonna do a lot

2740
04:14:02,770 --> 04:14:03,770
We can try

2741
04:14:03,770 --> 04:14:05,389
Might as well right?

2742
04:14:05,389 --> 04:14:08,389
Yeah you can back out whenever it's looking rough

2743
04:14:08,389 --> 04:14:13,340
We get fire

2744
04:14:13,340 --> 04:14:14,340
Oh fuck

2745
04:14:14,340 --> 04:14:15,340
Ow

2746
04:14:15,340 --> 04:14:16,340
I'm coming I'm coming

2747
04:14:16,340 --> 04:14:18,340
Don't let it reset

2748
04:14:18,340 --> 04:14:20,340
Oh shit it killed me

2749
04:14:20,340 --> 04:14:21,340
No

2750
04:14:21,340 --> 04:14:22,340
It killed me too

2751
04:14:22,340 --> 04:14:24,340
What the fuck

2752
04:14:24,340 --> 04:14:26,340
What the hell

2753
04:14:34,340 --> 04:14:36,340
What the fuck are you talking about?

2754
04:14:36,340 --> 04:14:37,340
Is that not supposed to do that?

2755
04:14:37,340 --> 04:14:39,709
On my screen you're holding onto nothing

2756
04:14:39,709 --> 04:14:42,399
You're just floating

2757
04:14:42,399 --> 04:14:44,399
How long am I supposed to hold this for?

2758
04:14:44,399 --> 04:14:45,399
A while

2759
04:14:45,399 --> 04:14:46,399
Um

2760
04:14:46,399 --> 04:14:48,399
Um I'm gonna run out of

2761
04:14:48,399 --> 04:14:50,399
I'm gonna run out of grip

2762
04:14:50,399 --> 04:14:51,399
I'm gonna run out of grip

2763
04:14:51,399 --> 04:14:56,819
Hold on hold on

2764
04:14:56,819 --> 04:14:59,729
What?

2765
04:14:59,729 --> 04:15:00,729
Shit

2766
04:15:22,459 --> 04:15:23,459
Alright

2767
04:15:23,459 --> 04:15:25,459
Seven minutes including chest

2768
04:15:25,459 --> 04:15:28,459
I'm gonna put my headphones in and just shut the fuck up and do it as best as I can

2769
04:15:28,459 --> 04:15:30,459
Thirty seconds

2770
04:15:30,459 --> 04:15:42,590
I just ran back to the entrance

2771
04:15:42,590 --> 04:15:51,899
Time

2772
04:15:51,899 --> 04:15:53,899
Oh that's what ruined everything

2773
04:15:53,899 --> 04:15:55,899
Six fifty six

2774
04:15:55,899 --> 04:15:56,899
Nineteen

2775
04:15:56,899 --> 04:15:57,899
That would have been it

2776
04:15:57,899 --> 04:15:58,899
Oh no

2777
04:15:58,899 --> 04:16:00,389
Time

2778
04:16:00,389 --> 04:16:01,389
That was it

2779
04:16:01,389 --> 04:16:03,389
Yeah nine seconds alright

2780
04:16:06,040 --> 04:16:07,040
Yeah

2781
04:16:07,040 --> 04:16:09,040
Go look in here there's a fucking clock in here

2782
04:16:09,040 --> 04:16:13,200
Oh my god

2783
04:16:18,000 --> 04:16:19,000
You can lower the...

2784
04:16:19,000 --> 04:16:20,000
I'm getting Luigi alright

2785
04:16:20,000 --> 04:16:22,000
I'm getting Luigi

2786
04:16:22,000 --> 04:16:23,000
I'm gonna need these later

2787
04:16:23,000 --> 04:16:24,000
I'm taking them with me

2788
04:16:24,000 --> 04:16:37,500
I'm taking all these with me

2789
04:16:37,500 --> 04:16:38,500
Don't

2790
04:16:38,500 --> 04:16:39,500
Don't

2791
04:16:39,500 --> 04:16:40,500
Don't

2792
04:16:40,500 --> 04:16:44,750
What the fuck

2793
04:16:44,750 --> 04:16:45,750
Can I have one?

2794
04:16:45,750 --> 04:16:46,750
Can I please have one?

2795
04:16:46,750 --> 04:16:48,750
Why did it let go?

2796
04:16:48,750 --> 04:17:00,299
Nice

2797
04:17:00,299 --> 04:17:02,299
There's one other at least one other player for sure

2798
04:17:03,299 --> 04:17:19,959
Guys

2799
04:17:19,959 --> 04:17:21,959
How do I land?

2800
04:17:21,959 --> 04:17:26,120
How do I what?

2801
04:17:26,120 --> 04:17:28,120
Dude you kicking butt right now dude

2802
04:17:29,299 --> 04:17:30,299
Nice

2803
04:17:30,299 --> 04:17:32,299
I can't even

2804
04:17:40,690 --> 04:17:41,690
This game is fucking easy

2805
04:17:41,690 --> 04:17:47,540
Shit

2806
04:17:47,540 --> 04:17:49,540
Do not flip the car

2807
04:17:49,540 --> 04:17:51,540
Under any circumstance

2808
04:17:51,540 --> 04:17:52,540
Don't do it

2809
04:17:52,540 --> 04:17:53,540
It's not funny

2810
04:17:53,540 --> 04:17:54,540
It's not a joke

2811
04:17:55,840 --> 04:17:56,840
It would be annoying

2812
04:17:56,840 --> 04:17:59,840
Because you just wasted like thirty five straight minutes cutting wood

2813
04:18:01,209 --> 04:18:02,209
Jeremy

2814
04:18:02,209 --> 04:18:04,579
I know you think you're quite the comedian

2815
04:18:04,579 --> 04:18:06,879
But this is not the time to do that

2816
04:18:06,879 --> 04:18:08,440
Let's go

2817
04:18:08,440 --> 04:18:14,329
And a lot of people are gonna think that that was on purpose

2818
04:18:14,329 --> 04:18:15,329
But it was not

2819
04:18:16,329 --> 04:18:17,329
Like a utility

2820
04:18:26,500 --> 04:18:27,500
We're good we're good we're good

2821
04:18:27,500 --> 04:18:29,000
We're good we're good we're good

2822
04:18:30,000 --> 04:18:31,000
We're good we're good

2823
04:18:31,000 --> 04:18:32,000
We're good we're good

2824
04:18:33,000 --> 04:18:34,239
Big points on the board right now

2825
04:18:34,239 --> 04:18:35,239
Big points

2826
04:18:38,670 --> 04:18:39,670
We have a replay

2827
04:18:39,670 --> 04:18:40,670
Review

2828
04:18:40,670 --> 04:18:42,729
Oh fuck I got beam I got beam

2829
04:18:43,729 --> 04:18:44,729
I need red I need red

2830
04:18:44,729 --> 04:18:45,729
Oh guys we need to get to the fucking

2831
04:18:45,729 --> 04:18:47,729
We need to get in the car and get the fuck out

2832
04:18:47,729 --> 04:18:48,729
I need res I need res

2833
04:18:48,729 --> 04:18:49,729
I don't laugh

2834
04:18:49,729 --> 04:18:50,729
Double res double res

2835
04:18:50,729 --> 04:18:51,729
Shit

2836
04:18:51,729 --> 04:18:52,729
He's not a gamer

2837
04:18:52,729 --> 04:18:53,729
Double res double res

2838
04:18:53,729 --> 04:18:54,729
Smith don't

2839
04:18:54,729 --> 04:18:55,729
I'm coming around

2840
04:18:55,729 --> 04:18:56,729
Don't shut it

2841
04:18:56,729 --> 04:18:57,729
Do you have a way to get out of here?

2842
04:18:57,729 --> 04:18:58,729
I guess you just run

2843
04:18:59,729 --> 04:19:00,729
Behind you

2844
04:19:00,729 --> 04:19:03,629
Flashbang going out

2845
04:19:04,629 --> 04:19:05,629
Flashbang going out

2846
04:19:08,870 --> 04:19:11,579
God damn it

2847
04:19:11,579 --> 04:19:12,579
What the fuck

2848
04:19:12,579 --> 04:19:13,579
Back back back back

2849
04:19:14,579 --> 04:19:15,579
Oh no

2850
04:19:15,579 --> 04:19:16,579
Oh no

2851
04:19:19,579 --> 04:19:20,579
I don't know where the person is

2852
04:19:20,579 --> 04:19:21,579
I don't know where the person is

2853
04:19:22,579 --> 04:19:23,579
I don't know where the person is

2854
04:19:24,579 --> 04:19:36,260
Wow

2855
04:19:36,260 --> 04:19:37,879
Jesus

2856
04:19:37,879 --> 04:19:38,879
Whoa

2857
04:19:38,879 --> 04:19:39,879
Really?

2858
04:19:39,879 --> 04:19:40,879
Whoa dude

2859
04:19:40,879 --> 04:19:41,879
That was bad

2860
04:19:41,879 --> 04:19:42,879
I have to leave now

2861
04:19:42,879 --> 04:19:43,879
That was awful

2862
04:19:43,879 --> 04:19:44,879
I can't

2863
04:19:44,879 --> 04:19:45,879
I uh

2864
04:19:45,879 --> 04:19:46,879
I didn't get anything

2865
04:19:46,879 --> 04:19:52,540
We're in trouble

2866
04:19:52,540 --> 04:19:53,540
How do we

2867
04:19:53,540 --> 04:19:54,540
How do I solve

2868
04:19:54,540 --> 04:19:55,540
Half of these are from

2869
04:19:55,540 --> 04:19:56,540
Is there anything I can eat

2870
04:19:56,540 --> 04:19:57,540
That takes me to the last bonfire

2871
04:19:57,540 --> 04:19:58,540
How do I fix this

2872
04:19:58,540 --> 04:19:59,540
Into the forest

2873
04:20:00,540 --> 04:20:01,540
I'm so sorry

2874
04:20:02,540 --> 04:20:03,780
Shit

2875
04:20:04,780 --> 04:20:06,590
This is bad

2876
04:20:06,590 --> 04:20:07,590
This is bad

2877
04:20:07,590 --> 04:20:08,590
This is bad

2878
04:20:08,590 --> 04:20:09,590
This is bad

2879
04:20:09,590 --> 04:20:10,590
This is bad

2880
04:20:10,590 --> 04:20:11,590
This is bad

2881
04:20:11,590 --> 04:20:12,590
This is bad

2882
04:20:12,590 --> 04:20:13,590
Um

2883
04:20:13,590 --> 04:20:14,590
I think we're in trouble

2884
04:20:14,590 --> 04:20:15,590
I think we're in trouble

2885
04:20:15,590 --> 04:20:16,590
We're in trouble

2886
04:20:17,590 --> 04:20:24,909
See here

2887
04:20:24,909 --> 04:20:25,909
Keep your eyes on the lady

2888
04:20:26,909 --> 04:20:28,149
Where is she gonna go

2889
04:20:28,149 --> 04:20:29,149
Where is she gonna go

2890
04:20:36,149 --> 04:20:37,149
I got it

2891
04:20:37,149 --> 04:20:38,149
That was easy

2892
04:20:38,149 --> 04:20:42,120
Oh Bodo don't be feeling too bad

2893
04:20:42,120 --> 04:20:43,120
Ain't nobody can

2894
04:20:43,120 --> 04:20:44,120
What?

2895
04:20:44,120 --> 04:20:45,120
Wait what happened

2896
04:20:45,120 --> 04:20:46,120
Was I not even looking

2897
04:20:46,120 --> 04:20:51,780
Hey let's do the rest of this

2898
04:20:51,780 --> 04:20:52,780
With my fucking eyes closed

2899
04:20:52,780 --> 04:20:53,780
Stop making jokes

2900
04:20:53,780 --> 04:20:54,780
Stop

2901
04:20:54,780 --> 04:21:01,329
Oh my god

2902
04:21:01,329 --> 04:21:02,329
What am I doing

2903
04:21:02,329 --> 04:21:04,020
Why did I do that

2904
04:21:04,020 --> 04:21:05,020
Why did I do that

2905
04:21:05,020 --> 04:21:06,020
I was gonna make like a joke

2906
04:21:06,020 --> 04:21:07,020
Where I was gonna close my eyes

2907
04:21:07,020 --> 04:21:08,020
And cast a spell

2908
04:21:08,020 --> 04:21:09,020
This hurt so bad

2909
04:21:09,020 --> 04:21:10,020
What the fuck are you doing

2910
04:21:10,020 --> 04:21:11,020
What am I doing

2911
04:21:12,020 --> 04:21:13,020
Why would I do that

2912
04:21:13,020 --> 04:21:14,020
Internally

2913
04:21:14,020 --> 04:21:15,020
I was so internally mad at myself

2914
04:21:15,020 --> 04:21:16,020
I swear to god

2915
04:21:17,579 --> 04:21:18,579
Kill him kill him

2916
04:21:18,579 --> 04:21:19,579
I can't do it

2917
04:21:19,579 --> 04:21:20,579
I don't know how to do it

2918
04:21:20,579 --> 04:21:21,579
Kill him

2919
04:21:21,579 --> 04:21:22,579
I don't know how to do it

2920
04:21:22,579 --> 04:21:23,579
Kill him

2921
04:21:23,579 --> 04:21:24,579
I don't know how to do it

2922
04:21:25,579 --> 04:21:26,579
What

2923
04:21:26,579 --> 04:21:27,579
What are you doing

2924
04:21:41,559 --> 04:21:42,559
A lot of good ones

2925
04:21:44,889 --> 04:21:45,889
But there can only be one winner

2926
04:21:48,020 --> 04:21:49,020
I'm trying to peek

2927
04:21:49,020 --> 04:21:50,020
Let's see

2928
04:21:51,780 --> 04:21:52,780
I can't see through the envelope

2929
04:21:56,129 --> 04:21:57,129
Your winner

2930
04:21:57,129 --> 04:22:00,299
For worst gamer moment of the whole year

2931
04:22:01,299 --> 04:22:05,549
Actually surprising

2932
04:22:06,920 --> 04:22:08,920
24.4% of the vote

2933
04:22:09,920 --> 04:22:11,799
Kill him

2934
04:22:11,799 --> 04:22:12,799
Kill him

2935
04:22:12,799 --> 04:22:13,799
I don't know how to do it

2936
04:22:14,799 --> 04:22:15,799
From Among Us

2937
04:22:15,799 --> 04:22:16,799
VR

2938
04:22:16,799 --> 04:22:20,450
And then at 11%

2939
04:22:20,450 --> 04:22:21,450
We're going way down

2940
04:22:22,450 --> 04:22:23,450
11.7%

2941
04:22:23,450 --> 04:22:25,450
Margaret is one hit away

2942
04:22:26,450 --> 04:22:28,450
Let's do the rest of this with my eyes closed

2943
04:22:29,450 --> 04:22:31,940
And then trying to land in Fortnite at 9%

2944
04:22:32,940 --> 04:22:35,889
Apparently that first one was so bad

2945
04:22:35,889 --> 04:22:36,889
I don't play Among Us

2946
04:22:37,889 --> 04:22:39,770
I don't play it

2947
04:22:39,770 --> 04:22:40,770
How was I supposed to know that

2948
04:22:40,770 --> 04:22:41,770
Is that

2949
04:22:41,770 --> 04:22:42,770
That's not

2950
04:22:42,770 --> 04:22:43,770
That's not a worst gamer moment

2951
04:22:43,770 --> 04:22:44,770
That is a

2952
04:22:44,770 --> 04:22:45,770
I didn't do the tutorial moment

2953
04:22:46,770 --> 04:22:48,770
Because I wanted to get in and hang out with my friends

2954
04:22:48,770 --> 04:22:49,770
And play video games

2955
04:22:49,770 --> 04:22:50,770
What

2956
04:22:50,770 --> 04:22:51,770
Is that a fucking crime

2957
04:22:52,770 --> 04:22:55,159
Oh boy

2958
04:22:56,659 --> 04:23:01,670
This is a big one

2959
04:23:03,299 --> 04:23:04,299
Coming up next

2960
04:23:04,299 --> 04:23:05,299
This is number 24 on the night

2961
04:23:06,729 --> 04:23:09,729
This is the worst overall stream of the whole year

2962
04:23:10,729 --> 04:23:11,729
Or worst stream segment

2963
04:23:12,729 --> 04:23:16,440
What do you think the worst stream this year was

2964
04:23:19,020 --> 04:23:20,020
I have few guesses

2965
04:23:20,020 --> 04:23:23,629
I don't know

2966
04:23:23,629 --> 04:23:25,190
Let me

2967
04:23:25,190 --> 04:23:26,190
Before you show the nominees

2968
04:23:27,370 --> 04:23:28,930
Oh

2969
04:23:28,930 --> 04:23:29,930
It's toasty

2970
04:23:29,930 --> 04:23:33,809
Every stream I try to have it be fun

2971
04:23:34,809 --> 04:23:35,809
I try to have a good time

2972
04:23:35,809 --> 04:23:37,809
An idea that maybe

2973
04:23:37,809 --> 04:23:38,809
Oh this is a new idea

2974
04:23:38,809 --> 04:23:39,809
Maybe this is an old idea

2975
04:23:40,809 --> 04:23:42,809
Every stream I want to be fun

2976
04:23:42,809 --> 04:23:43,809
Right

2977
04:23:43,809 --> 04:23:44,809
That's the whole goal

2978
04:23:44,809 --> 04:23:45,809
As a streamer

2979
04:23:45,809 --> 04:23:47,809
You want the streams to be good

2980
04:23:48,979 --> 04:23:49,979
Sometimes you miss the mark

2981
04:23:51,350 --> 04:23:52,350
And we're about to find out

2982
04:23:54,100 --> 04:23:56,100
How badly that mark was missed

2983
04:23:56,100 --> 04:23:57,920
Ladies and gentlemen

2984
04:23:58,920 --> 04:24:00,350
For 2022

2985
04:24:01,350 --> 04:24:02,850
Here are your nominees

2986
04:24:03,850 --> 04:24:06,850
For worst stream or stream segment of the entire year

2987
04:24:16,790 --> 04:24:17,790
There's one other

2988
04:24:17,790 --> 04:24:22,940
At least one other player for sure

2989
04:24:22,940 --> 04:24:23,940
This is pretty bad

2990
04:24:23,940 --> 04:24:24,940
Alright whatever

2991
04:24:24,940 --> 04:24:25,940
I don't play Fortnite

2992
04:24:25,940 --> 04:24:26,940
I don't play this game

2993
04:24:27,940 --> 04:24:29,940
I just want to hang out with some cool friends

2994
04:24:29,940 --> 04:24:30,940
Streamer friends

2995
04:24:30,940 --> 04:24:31,940
Right like what the fuck

2996
04:24:32,940 --> 04:24:33,940
Is that so bad

2997
04:24:34,940 --> 04:24:36,180
Guys

2998
04:24:36,180 --> 04:24:37,180
How do I land

2999
04:24:38,180 --> 04:24:39,180
I have what's it called

3000
04:24:39,180 --> 04:24:40,180
Splash

3001
04:24:40,180 --> 04:24:41,180
I could throw it at everyone

3002
04:24:41,180 --> 04:24:42,180
I've got six minis

3003
04:24:43,180 --> 04:24:44,180
Big pot

3004
04:24:45,180 --> 04:24:46,180
I don't know

3005
04:24:46,180 --> 04:24:47,180
I don't know

3006
04:24:47,180 --> 04:24:48,180
I went in the dumpster

3007
04:24:48,180 --> 04:24:49,180
Okay for all of you

3008
04:24:49,180 --> 04:24:50,180
Worst stream ever Andes

3009
04:24:50,180 --> 04:24:51,180
Alright

3010
04:24:51,180 --> 04:24:52,180
Alright

3011
04:24:54,180 --> 04:24:55,180
I'm not going to redress it anymore

3012
04:24:56,180 --> 04:24:57,180
I'm not going to redress it anymore

3013
04:24:58,180 --> 04:24:59,180
I'm just telling you

3014
04:25:00,860 --> 04:25:02,860
You need to respect me for a minute

3015
04:25:03,860 --> 04:25:04,860
This sucks

3016
04:25:04,860 --> 04:25:05,860
That's how you know

3017
04:25:05,860 --> 04:25:06,860
Excuse me

3018
04:25:06,860 --> 04:25:07,860
What do you mean

3019
04:25:08,860 --> 04:25:09,860
Excuse me

3020
04:25:09,860 --> 04:25:10,860
This was picked in pre-stream chat

3021
04:25:10,860 --> 04:25:11,860
This was a prank

3022
04:25:11,860 --> 04:25:12,860
No this is not a prank

3023
04:25:12,860 --> 04:25:13,860
I like people

3024
04:25:13,860 --> 04:25:14,860
In the pre-stream people were like

3025
04:25:14,860 --> 04:25:15,860
Yo dude Glover Pog

3026
04:25:18,360 --> 04:25:19,360
How much I'm looking at chat

3027
04:25:19,360 --> 04:25:21,360
The hacker wanted me to play this by the way

3028
04:25:21,360 --> 04:25:22,360
Which I don't know about that

3029
04:25:22,360 --> 04:25:23,360
This is

3030
04:25:23,360 --> 04:25:24,360
This is kind of

3031
04:25:24,360 --> 04:25:25,360
This is a PogChamp game

3032
04:25:25,360 --> 04:25:26,360
Dude you fell off

3033
04:25:27,360 --> 04:25:30,360
You can't fall off in 20 minutes

3034
04:25:30,360 --> 04:25:32,360
You can't fall off in 20 minutes

3035
04:25:32,360 --> 04:25:33,360
Okay

3036
04:25:33,360 --> 04:25:34,360
You can't fall off

3037
04:25:34,360 --> 04:25:35,360
I didn't fall off

3038
04:25:35,360 --> 04:25:36,360
It's been 15 minutes

3039
04:25:36,360 --> 04:25:38,360
You don't fall off in 15 minutes

3040
04:25:38,360 --> 04:25:39,360
Okay 20%

3041
04:25:40,360 --> 04:25:41,360
90%

3042
04:25:42,360 --> 04:25:44,110
Is Buster already made

3043
04:25:45,110 --> 04:25:50,379
What am I doing wrong

3044
04:25:50,379 --> 04:25:54,100
It's 20% and 80%

3045
04:25:54,100 --> 04:25:56,100
Or 10% and 90% right

3046
04:25:56,100 --> 04:25:57,100
Settle down it's fine

3047
04:25:57,100 --> 04:26:01,450
Dude this is genuinely worse than the clock

3048
04:26:02,450 --> 04:26:03,450
What

3049
04:26:03,450 --> 04:26:04,450
How is this worse than the clock

3050
04:26:04,450 --> 04:26:06,010
I'm doing what it says

3051
04:26:06,010 --> 04:26:08,719
Is what I'm supposed to be doing

3052
04:26:08,719 --> 04:26:09,719
If you can get it to work

3053
04:26:09,719 --> 04:26:12,719
It's definitely a lot better

3054
04:26:13,719 --> 04:26:14,719
The person was standing still

3055
04:26:14,719 --> 04:26:15,719
And I couldn't even kill him

3056
04:26:15,719 --> 04:26:17,719
I'm so bad at this game

3057
04:26:17,719 --> 04:26:20,110
Next point up

3058
04:26:20,110 --> 04:26:21,110
Let's go

3059
04:26:22,110 --> 04:26:23,110
That's me

3060
04:26:23,110 --> 04:26:24,110
That's me

3061
04:26:24,110 --> 04:26:25,110
That's you

3062
04:26:25,110 --> 04:26:26,110
That's you

3063
04:26:26,110 --> 04:26:27,110
Oh I thought that was a bad guy

3064
04:26:28,110 --> 04:26:29,110
We're good

3065
04:26:29,110 --> 04:26:30,110
We're good

3066
04:26:30,110 --> 04:26:38,010
We're good

3067
04:26:38,010 --> 04:26:39,500
We're good

3068
04:26:39,500 --> 04:26:40,500
We're good

3069
04:26:40,500 --> 04:26:41,500
We're good

3070
04:26:41,500 --> 04:26:42,500
Bye bye

3071
04:26:42,500 --> 04:26:43,500
See you guys later

3072
04:26:43,500 --> 04:26:48,649
Be blessed

3073
04:26:48,649 --> 04:26:50,270
Shoot

3074
04:26:50,270 --> 04:26:51,270
I was bought a fragger

3075
04:26:51,270 --> 04:26:52,270
Tell him you're the sus guy

3076
04:26:56,930 --> 04:26:59,299
This one was so mad

3077
04:26:59,299 --> 04:27:00,299
This is streamers choice

3078
04:27:00,299 --> 04:27:01,299
This wins

3079
04:27:01,299 --> 04:27:02,299
I'm about to veto this

3080
04:27:02,299 --> 04:27:04,430
All gone

3081
04:27:06,799 --> 04:27:08,799
I think I have to veto this whole thing

3082
04:27:14,500 --> 04:27:15,500
In the meantime

3083
04:27:15,500 --> 04:27:18,500
If there's any more You Laugh You Lose compilations

3084
04:27:18,500 --> 04:27:19,500
I'd love to watch them

3085
04:27:19,500 --> 04:27:20,500
Maybe just

3086
04:27:20,500 --> 04:27:22,500
We can get them vetted quickly or something

3087
04:27:22,500 --> 04:27:23,500
But I ain't watching

3088
04:27:23,500 --> 04:27:24,500
I'm done after this

3089
04:27:24,500 --> 04:27:25,500
This is a fucking bullshit idea

3090
04:27:25,500 --> 04:27:27,500
This is one of the worst ideas I've ever had

3091
04:27:27,500 --> 04:27:29,500
Figure out the Disney lyrics

3092
04:27:31,500 --> 04:27:34,860
Up on that beach

3093
04:27:34,860 --> 04:27:39,049
Up on that shore

3094
04:27:39,049 --> 04:27:46,000
Up on that many people galore

3095
04:27:46,000 --> 04:27:48,370
Makes you kind of think

3096
04:27:48,370 --> 04:27:51,370
I can go the distance

3097
04:27:51,370 --> 04:27:52,370
This was good

3098
04:27:52,370 --> 04:27:55,370
I'll be there someday

3099
04:27:55,370 --> 04:27:58,370
If I can be strong

3100
04:27:58,370 --> 04:28:01,370
I know every mile

3101
04:28:01,370 --> 04:28:04,370
Will be worth my while

3102
04:28:05,370 --> 04:28:06,370
I figured it out

3103
04:28:06,370 --> 04:28:08,370
Any of the bosses that have like the

3104
04:28:14,989 --> 04:28:15,989
Ludwig has it

3105
04:28:15,989 --> 04:28:16,989
Godric has it

3106
04:28:16,989 --> 04:28:17,989
Ibritas has it

3107
04:28:17,989 --> 04:28:18,989
They all have it

3108
04:28:18,989 --> 04:28:31,409
Bro that looked like battle chess

3109
04:28:31,409 --> 04:28:32,409
The string was so bad

3110
04:28:32,409 --> 04:28:33,409
Somebody just said

3111
04:28:33,409 --> 04:28:34,649
It was

3112
04:28:34,649 --> 04:28:35,649
It was fucking terrible

3113
04:28:35,649 --> 04:28:36,649
Oh my god

3114
04:28:36,649 --> 04:28:38,649
He just ruined Dark Souls 2 for me forever

3115
04:28:38,649 --> 04:28:39,649
No

3116
04:28:39,649 --> 04:28:40,649
No

3117
04:28:40,649 --> 04:28:41,649
No

3118
04:28:41,649 --> 04:28:42,649
No

3119
04:28:42,649 --> 04:28:43,889
No

3120
04:28:43,889 --> 04:28:47,500
Yes

3121
04:28:47,500 --> 04:28:49,309
Yes

3122
04:28:49,309 --> 04:28:51,190
Yes

3123
04:28:51,190 --> 04:29:01,549
Funny story about the Dark Souls From Software tier list

3124
04:29:01,549 --> 04:29:03,860
And I'm going to be honest

3125
04:29:03,860 --> 04:29:07,100
I got halfway through that list and internally

3126
04:29:07,100 --> 04:29:08,530
Wanted to stop

3127
04:29:08,530 --> 04:29:11,459
But you can't

3128
04:29:11,459 --> 04:29:12,459
It was like another three hours

3129
04:29:12,459 --> 04:29:15,459
It was like a four and a half hour stream

3130
04:29:15,459 --> 04:29:16,889
I remember getting halfway through

3131
04:29:16,889 --> 04:29:18,889
Scrolling down and just going

3132
04:29:18,889 --> 04:29:21,959
There's like a hundred bosses

3133
04:29:21,959 --> 04:29:23,959
I still haven't rated yet

3134
04:29:23,959 --> 04:29:26,139
Internally I wanted to turn the stream off

3135
04:29:26,139 --> 04:29:27,139
But I didn't

3136
04:29:27,139 --> 04:29:29,139
I powered through

3137
04:29:29,139 --> 04:29:31,079
And it was a mistake

3138
04:29:31,079 --> 04:29:33,079
Could have just played

3139
04:29:33,079 --> 04:29:35,959
Could have just played like Picross

3140
04:29:35,959 --> 04:29:39,420
And people would have been happy

3141
04:29:39,420 --> 04:29:40,420
Ladies and gentlemen

3142
04:29:40,420 --> 04:29:45,020
The winner of the worst stream of the whole year

3143
04:29:45,020 --> 04:29:58,959
It was close

3144
04:29:58,959 --> 04:30:00,260
It was close

3145
04:30:00,260 --> 04:30:05,100
With 27.6% of the vote

3146
04:30:05,100 --> 04:30:08,239
Number one

3147
04:30:08,239 --> 04:30:10,239
And then 26.2

3148
04:30:10,239 --> 04:30:12,239
All these votes count by the way

3149
04:30:12,239 --> 04:30:13,239
Oh I'm not going to vote

3150
04:30:13,239 --> 04:30:15,239
Because I don't think it counts

3151
04:30:15,239 --> 04:30:18,180
27.6 in one

3152
04:30:18,180 --> 04:30:20,180
26.2 in two

3153
04:30:20,180 --> 04:30:22,180
Number one

3154
04:30:22,180 --> 04:30:24,180
The Fortnite tournament

3155
04:30:24,180 --> 04:30:27,579
I think I was alive for four minutes

3156
04:30:27,579 --> 04:30:30,579
And the stream was like three hours long

3157
04:30:30,579 --> 04:30:33,840
And then baby sensory videos

3158
04:30:33,840 --> 04:30:36,840
Baby sensory videos right behind the 26.2

3159
04:30:36,840 --> 04:30:37,840
That was a bad

3160
04:30:37,840 --> 04:30:38,840
I thought that was so funny

3161
04:30:38,840 --> 04:30:40,840
When we first talked about it

3162
04:30:40,840 --> 04:30:43,209
Oh dude what a fun idea

3163
04:30:43,209 --> 04:30:45,209
I'll do baby sensory videos

3164
04:30:45,209 --> 04:30:47,700
I don't know

3165
04:30:47,700 --> 04:30:48,700
They're scary

3166
04:30:48,700 --> 04:30:49,700
If you've seen one

3167
04:30:49,700 --> 04:30:51,700
They're terrifying

3168
04:30:51,700 --> 04:30:52,700
It wasn't even funny

3169
04:30:52,700 --> 04:30:54,010
It was just

3170
04:30:54,010 --> 04:30:56,010
It was odd

3171
04:30:56,010 --> 04:30:58,010
It's just odd

3172
04:30:58,010 --> 04:30:59,010
You know

3173
04:30:59,010 --> 04:31:01,010
Okay those of you streamers out there

3174
04:31:01,010 --> 04:31:02,010
If you're watching

3175
04:31:02,010 --> 04:31:04,010
You know when you get that moment

3176
04:31:04,010 --> 04:31:06,010
When you're doing something

3177
04:31:06,010 --> 04:31:08,010
And you just go

3178
04:31:08,010 --> 04:31:09,180
Fuck this is bad

3179
04:31:09,180 --> 04:31:11,180
And I don't know what to do

3180
04:31:11,180 --> 04:31:12,180
I don't know how to get out of this

3181
04:31:12,180 --> 04:31:13,180
How do I get out of this

3182
04:31:13,180 --> 04:31:14,180
How do I get out of this

3183
04:31:14,180 --> 04:31:16,180
There has to be a way I can get out of this

3184
04:31:16,180 --> 04:31:17,180
And there isn't

3185
04:31:17,180 --> 04:31:19,180
And you have to sleep in the bed that you made

3186
04:31:19,180 --> 04:31:21,180
That was the baby sensory

3187
04:31:21,180 --> 04:31:24,180
Because I hyped that up for a week or two

3188
04:31:24,180 --> 04:31:26,180
Oh we're going to do baby sensory videos

3189
04:31:26,180 --> 04:31:27,180
It's going to be crazy

3190
04:31:27,180 --> 04:31:29,180
Wow we're going to talk about them

3191
04:31:29,180 --> 04:31:32,180
And after one or two

3192
04:31:32,180 --> 04:31:34,870
I wanted to turn the stream off so bad

3193
04:31:34,870 --> 04:31:35,870
And I was like I just want to go

3194
04:31:35,870 --> 04:31:36,870
I want to take a bath

3195
04:31:36,870 --> 04:31:37,870
I just want to get out of here

3196
04:31:37,870 --> 04:31:39,870
But you can't

3197
04:31:39,870 --> 04:31:44,180
Number three by the way was at 15%

3198
04:31:44,180 --> 04:31:46,180
Mythbusters the game

3199
04:31:46,180 --> 04:31:48,180
Yeah it wasn't very good

3200
04:31:48,180 --> 04:31:50,420
These are your worst streams of the year

3201
04:31:50,420 --> 04:31:51,420
I don't play

3202
04:31:51,420 --> 04:31:52,420
I don't play video games

3203
04:31:52,420 --> 04:31:54,420
I'm not a video gamer

3204
04:31:54,420 --> 04:31:56,420
I am though because Elden Ring

3205
04:31:56,420 --> 04:31:57,420
I beat Elden Ring

3206
04:31:57,420 --> 04:31:58,420
I beat Dark Souls 3

3207
04:31:58,420 --> 04:31:59,420
I beat Dark Souls Remastered

3208
04:31:59,420 --> 04:32:00,420
How can you not say that

3209
04:32:00,420 --> 04:32:01,420
I just

3210
04:32:01,420 --> 04:32:02,420
I don't play certain types of games

3211
04:32:02,420 --> 04:32:03,420
I don't play Fortnite

3212
04:32:03,420 --> 04:32:05,420
I don't play Call of Duty

3213
04:32:05,420 --> 04:32:06,420
Who cares?

3214
04:32:06,420 --> 04:32:07,420
Right?

3215
04:32:07,420 --> 04:32:08,420
Whatever

3216
04:32:08,420 --> 04:32:09,420
You know what?

3217
04:32:09,420 --> 04:32:10,420
Let's go check in with the elves

3218
04:32:12,590 --> 04:32:14,540
Follow me

3219
04:32:14,540 --> 04:32:29,700
Elves I'm coming to say hello

3220
04:32:29,700 --> 04:32:33,379
There's a noise in here

3221
04:32:40,899 --> 04:32:41,899
Hello

3222
04:32:41,899 --> 04:32:44,780
What are you doing?

3223
04:32:44,780 --> 04:32:45,780
Investing

3224
04:32:45,780 --> 04:32:46,780
We're investing the money

3225
04:32:46,780 --> 04:32:47,780
brainstorming

3226
04:32:47,780 --> 04:32:49,780
That you promised us

3227
04:32:49,780 --> 04:32:50,780
What do you got here?

3228
04:32:50,780 --> 04:32:52,780
How do you feel about investing in NLTs?

3229
04:32:52,780 --> 04:32:53,780
NLTs they're going to take off

3230
04:32:53,780 --> 04:32:54,780
NLTs

3231
04:32:54,780 --> 04:32:55,780
Not what you're thinking

3232
04:32:55,780 --> 04:32:57,780
But they're actually LTs

3233
04:32:57,780 --> 04:32:58,780
Yeah

3234
04:32:58,780 --> 04:33:00,780
That's cool we have other ideas

3235
04:33:02,780 --> 04:33:03,780
Gingerbread

3236
04:33:03,780 --> 04:33:05,779
Robots to build puzzles

3237
04:33:05,779 --> 04:33:06,779
Yes

3238
04:33:06,779 --> 04:33:08,779
You need that considering you haven't done a god damn thing

3239
04:33:08,779 --> 04:33:10,779
But wait a minute

3240
04:33:10,779 --> 04:33:12,779
I feel a little disrespectful

3241
04:33:12,779 --> 04:33:14,779
Clearly there's some stuff happening

3242
04:33:14,779 --> 04:33:17,779
You've done a border of one of them

3243
04:33:17,779 --> 04:33:18,779
Oh she has

3244
04:33:18,779 --> 04:33:19,779
Puzzle girl

3245
04:33:19,779 --> 04:33:20,779
Puzzle girl

3246
04:33:20,779 --> 04:33:21,779
Puzzle girl

3247
04:33:21,779 --> 04:33:22,779
Puzzle girl

3248
04:33:22,779 --> 04:33:23,779
Puzzle girl

3249
04:33:23,779 --> 04:33:24,779
Puzzle girl

3250
04:33:24,779 --> 04:33:25,779
Puzzle girl

3251
04:33:25,779 --> 04:33:26,779
Puzzle girl

3252
04:33:26,779 --> 04:33:27,779
Puzzle girl

3253
04:33:27,779 --> 04:33:28,779
Puzzle girl

3254
04:33:28,779 --> 04:33:29,779
You ought to just stop

3255
04:33:29,779 --> 04:33:30,779
I was doing it still

3256
04:33:30,779 --> 04:33:31,779
You wanted to give me your phone

3257
04:33:31,779 --> 04:33:32,779
That's good

3258
04:33:32,779 --> 04:33:33,779
Oops

3259
04:33:33,779 --> 04:33:34,779
I got a better idea

3260
04:33:34,779 --> 04:33:35,779
How about this?

3261
04:33:35,779 --> 04:33:36,779
Why do I hear Smash Brothers?

3262
04:33:36,779 --> 04:33:37,779
Activities

3263
04:33:37,779 --> 04:33:38,779
We were also playing games

3264
04:33:38,779 --> 04:33:41,680
You're playing games?

3265
04:33:41,680 --> 04:33:42,680
Alright

3266
04:33:42,680 --> 04:33:43,680
I tried to hide it

3267
04:33:43,680 --> 04:33:44,680
You play games?

3268
04:33:45,680 --> 04:33:46,680
You're playing games?

3269
04:33:46,680 --> 04:33:47,680
Alright

3270
04:33:47,680 --> 04:33:48,680
I tried to hide it

3271
04:33:48,680 --> 04:33:49,680
You play games

3272
04:33:49,680 --> 04:33:51,680
I'll give that a sick

3273
04:33:51,680 --> 04:33:52,680
Oh nice

3274
04:33:55,680 --> 04:34:02,590
Hey these are a thousand dollar chips

3275
04:34:02,590 --> 04:34:04,590
These are a thousand bucks

3276
04:34:04,590 --> 04:34:06,590
Not if nobody's getting these

3277
04:34:06,590 --> 04:34:07,590
Hey elves

3278
04:34:07,590 --> 04:34:08,590
Yeah

3279
04:34:08,590 --> 04:34:10,590
Do you think it should be snowing in here?

3280
04:34:10,590 --> 04:34:11,590
Yeah

3281
04:34:11,590 --> 04:34:12,590
Yeah

3282
04:34:12,590 --> 04:34:13,590
We're doing puzzles

3283
04:34:13,590 --> 04:34:16,560
Hey chat

3284
04:34:16,560 --> 04:34:18,560
Should we start snowing in here yet do you think?

3285
04:34:18,560 --> 04:34:19,560
I don't know

3286
04:34:19,560 --> 04:34:21,299
You're not stealing it here yet, do you think?

3287
04:34:21,299 --> 04:34:22,759
I don't know.

3288
04:34:22,759 --> 04:34:24,439
I wanna make sure I see it first.

3289
04:34:25,819 --> 04:34:28,419
Should it start snowing for real this time?

3290
04:34:28,419 --> 04:34:30,990
Snow.

3291
04:34:30,990 --> 04:34:32,290
Do it for puzzle girl.

3292
04:34:32,290 --> 04:34:36,290
Snow, snow, snow, snow, snow, snow, snow, snow, snow, snow!

3293
04:34:36,290 --> 04:34:40,529
Snow, snow, snow, snow, snow, snow, snow, snow, snow

3294
04:34:40,529 --> 04:34:44,610
snow, snow, snow, snow, snow snow, snow

3295
04:34:44,610 --> 04:34:45,849
lets go!

3296
04:34:45,849 --> 04:34:56,819
Get you!

3297
04:34:56,819 --> 04:35:11,880
They were bored.

3298
04:35:11,880 --> 04:35:17,729
You know, all my presents got deleted, you know that, right?

3299
04:35:17,729 --> 04:35:19,729
It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be okay.

3300
04:35:19,729 --> 04:35:21,729
It's gonna be okay.

3301
04:35:21,729 --> 04:35:22,729
Who is this from?

3302
04:35:22,729 --> 04:35:23,729
From all of us.

3303
04:35:23,729 --> 04:35:26,060
From all the elves?

3304
04:35:26,060 --> 04:35:27,060
The elves.

3305
04:35:27,060 --> 04:35:29,060
Buck doing the puzzle, by the way,

3306
04:35:29,060 --> 04:35:31,060
because it's literally impossible.

3307
04:35:31,060 --> 04:35:34,060
Okay, from the elves.

3308
04:35:34,060 --> 04:35:35,060
What is it?

3309
04:35:35,060 --> 04:35:36,060
Maybe it's...

3310
04:35:36,060 --> 04:35:40,279
Could it be an Xbox?

3311
04:35:40,279 --> 04:35:41,279
What is this?

3312
04:35:41,279 --> 04:35:42,279
That's the baby with the puzzle.

3313
04:35:42,279 --> 04:35:47,150
Hey, give it up for the elves, can we please?

3314
04:35:47,150 --> 04:36:03,790
Give it up for them.

3315
04:36:03,790 --> 04:36:04,790
Why did I do that?

3316
04:36:04,790 --> 04:36:15,349
It's like being at the lunch table.

3317
04:36:15,349 --> 04:36:23,159
We're at the lunch table.

3318
04:36:23,159 --> 04:36:25,159
Meatball covered in gravy and all the fucked up...

3319
04:36:25,159 --> 04:36:27,650
I did that stuff when I was younger.

3320
04:36:27,650 --> 04:36:29,650
Give it up for the elves.

3321
04:36:29,650 --> 04:36:31,650
They did apps to fucking lootly nothing the whole day.

3322
04:36:31,650 --> 04:36:33,650
That's good.

3323
04:36:33,650 --> 04:36:36,650
Actually, that was an experiment to see if they could actually do anything.

3324
04:36:36,650 --> 04:36:39,830
It was like, oh, let's get 15 elves to be in a room

3325
04:36:39,830 --> 04:36:41,830
and do something and make a puzzle.

3326
04:36:41,830 --> 04:36:42,830
They didn't even come close.

3327
04:36:42,830 --> 04:36:44,830
They were just drinking the whole night.

3328
04:36:44,830 --> 04:36:45,830
But that's fine.

3329
04:36:45,830 --> 04:36:46,830
That's fine.

3330
04:36:46,830 --> 04:36:48,830
But I mean, the snow was fine.

3331
04:36:48,830 --> 04:36:49,830
They were fine.

3332
04:36:49,830 --> 04:36:51,830
They were a good group.

3333
04:36:51,830 --> 04:36:53,830
Now they got to clean all that up.

3334
04:36:53,830 --> 04:36:57,220
I can't believe I put that in my mouth.

3335
04:36:57,220 --> 04:37:00,889
More puzzle, pog, pog, more puzzle.

3336
04:37:00,889 --> 04:37:01,889
The mic is fucked up.

3337
04:37:01,889 --> 04:37:03,889
Did I fuck the mic up?

3338
04:37:03,889 --> 04:37:05,889
Did I ruin the mic?

3339
04:37:05,889 --> 04:37:09,369
Mic, oh, no.

3340
04:37:09,369 --> 04:37:15,700
All right, we are down to the last three categories of the night.

3341
04:37:15,700 --> 04:37:17,700
It's been a wild night.

3342
04:37:17,700 --> 04:37:20,770
It's been a wild night.

3343
04:37:20,770 --> 04:37:23,270
Maybe you've had a few alcoholic beverages.

3344
04:37:23,270 --> 04:37:24,270
Maybe you haven't.

3345
04:37:24,270 --> 04:37:26,270
Maybe you've had some tea.

3346
04:37:26,270 --> 04:37:28,639
But we're getting down to the last three.

3347
04:37:28,639 --> 04:37:30,639
And these are special.

3348
04:37:30,639 --> 04:37:37,860
This next one is favorite collab appearance.

3349
04:37:37,860 --> 04:37:41,479
I did a lot of other streams this year,

3350
04:37:41,479 --> 04:37:44,479
going onto other people's channels and traveling.

3351
04:37:44,479 --> 04:37:49,479
And there was a lot of shows that I was on that were not mine.

3352
04:37:49,479 --> 04:37:50,479
So this was fun.

3353
04:37:50,479 --> 04:37:53,479
It was actually really cool to go hang out with other streamers.

3354
04:37:53,479 --> 04:37:56,479
This is your favorite collab of the year,

3355
04:37:56,479 --> 04:37:58,479
whatever that one happened to be.

3356
04:37:58,479 --> 04:37:59,849
So here you go.

3357
04:37:59,849 --> 04:38:00,849
Here are your nominees.

3358
04:38:00,849 --> 04:38:01,849
We only got three more.

3359
04:38:01,849 --> 04:38:05,849
Favorite collab appearance outside of the channel that of you.

3360
04:38:05,849 --> 04:38:06,849
I can't even talk.

3361
04:38:06,849 --> 04:38:11,970
Of the year.

3362
04:38:11,970 --> 04:38:14,970
The favorite of the, of you, of the, of the.

3363
04:38:14,970 --> 04:38:21,029
Next contestant is definitely not photoshopped

3364
04:38:21,029 --> 04:38:22,029
and is very caked up.

3365
04:38:22,029 --> 04:38:27,720
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for Jeremy.

3366
04:38:27,720 --> 04:38:29,720
Actually, I wasn't going to bring this up.

3367
04:38:29,720 --> 04:38:31,720
His podium is bigger than mine.

3368
04:38:31,720 --> 04:38:32,720
I want to replace Mike.

3369
04:38:32,720 --> 04:38:35,720
It's at least a quarter of an inch higher than mine.

3370
04:38:35,720 --> 04:38:36,720
He's got podium envy.

3371
04:38:36,720 --> 04:38:37,720
Did you not read my writer?

3372
04:38:37,720 --> 04:38:38,720
Let me tell you something.

3373
04:38:38,720 --> 04:38:39,720
You bastard.

3374
04:38:39,720 --> 04:38:40,720
Let me tell you something.

3375
04:38:40,720 --> 04:38:42,720
My podium might be one or two inches bigger than yours,

3376
04:38:42,720 --> 04:38:43,720
but that doesn't matter.

3377
04:38:43,720 --> 04:38:45,720
You need to relax and go back to what you were doing.

3378
04:38:45,720 --> 04:38:47,720
Yeah, get back to what you're wrecked, please.

3379
04:38:47,720 --> 04:38:48,720
Have a seat in that, Jeremy.

3380
04:38:48,720 --> 04:38:49,720
Have a seat in that.

3381
04:38:49,720 --> 04:38:51,720
Bring that down for him, Will.

3382
04:38:51,720 --> 04:38:52,720
Oh!

3383
04:38:52,720 --> 04:38:53,720
Wow.

3384
04:38:53,720 --> 04:38:55,279
Yeah, the criticism.

3385
04:38:55,279 --> 04:38:56,279
Oh, look at that.

3386
04:38:56,279 --> 04:38:57,279
Okay.

3387
04:38:57,279 --> 04:38:58,279
Okay.

3388
04:38:58,279 --> 04:38:59,279
37 this year.

3389
04:38:59,279 --> 04:39:00,279
Oh.

3390
04:39:00,279 --> 04:39:02,279
We are not insured for this.

3391
04:39:02,279 --> 04:39:05,279
The winner of Name Your Price

3392
04:39:05,279 --> 04:39:08,580
between Jerma and Mia

3393
04:39:08,580 --> 04:39:14,360
is Jerma!

3394
04:39:14,360 --> 04:39:18,650
Congratulations!

3395
04:39:18,650 --> 04:39:21,650
This is where it gets very heated

3396
04:39:21,650 --> 04:39:24,650
because I know you have a two right here somewhere.

3397
04:39:24,650 --> 04:39:27,830
And ladies and gentlemen, we did it.

3398
04:39:27,830 --> 04:39:38,560
There's no fucking way.

3399
04:39:38,560 --> 04:39:40,560
And then, like, you bet like a little bit there,

3400
04:39:40,560 --> 04:39:42,560
and then maybe I'd be like, you know,

3401
04:39:42,560 --> 04:39:45,560
what's 50 more?

3402
04:39:45,560 --> 04:39:46,560
You know what I mean?

3403
04:39:46,560 --> 04:39:47,560
It's a nominal amount.

3404
04:39:47,560 --> 04:39:49,560
It's a nominal amount.

3405
04:39:49,560 --> 04:39:52,400
What does that mean?

3406
04:39:52,400 --> 04:39:57,779
Oh, Jerma, you absolute idiot.

3407
04:39:57,779 --> 04:39:58,779
Am I stupid?

3408
04:39:58,779 --> 04:40:00,779
Because I just won the game.

3409
04:40:00,779 --> 04:40:07,880
That's a three of a kind.

3410
04:40:07,880 --> 04:40:10,439
You just got shocked!

3411
04:40:10,439 --> 04:40:12,439
My music's been buffering all day,

3412
04:40:12,439 --> 04:40:13,439
so I was going to count until it buffered,

3413
04:40:13,439 --> 04:40:15,439
but then the music didn't buffer this time,

3414
04:40:15,439 --> 04:40:19,090
so I've just been counting.

3415
04:40:19,090 --> 04:40:20,459
Rock.

3416
04:40:20,459 --> 04:40:25,279
Yeah!

3417
04:40:25,279 --> 04:40:27,279
You just got to get the right leverage.

3418
04:40:27,279 --> 04:40:30,799
Oh, my Lord.

3419
04:40:30,799 --> 04:40:31,799
Hercules.

3420
04:40:31,799 --> 04:40:32,799
We're in costume.

3421
04:40:32,799 --> 04:40:35,799
I'm Mercy from the Overwatch 2.

3422
04:40:35,799 --> 04:40:37,799
And who's that?

3423
04:40:37,799 --> 04:40:38,799
Hey, how are you?

3424
04:40:38,799 --> 04:40:39,799
It's me, Deadpool.

3425
04:40:39,799 --> 04:40:40,799
Nice to see everybody.

3426
04:40:40,799 --> 04:40:41,799
Oh, my God.

3427
04:40:41,799 --> 04:40:42,799
It's so good to have you here.

3428
04:40:42,799 --> 04:40:43,799
Yeah, special guest here.

3429
04:40:43,799 --> 04:40:44,799
You just missed Jerma.

3430
04:40:44,799 --> 04:40:45,799
Did I?

3431
04:40:45,799 --> 04:40:46,799
Yeah, he was a great guy.

3432
04:40:46,799 --> 04:40:47,799
Oh, he's a fun dude.

3433
04:40:47,799 --> 04:40:48,799
He's kind of a weird guy.

3434
04:40:48,799 --> 04:40:49,799
Kind of a weird guy.

3435
04:40:49,799 --> 04:40:50,799
But I just missed him.

3436
04:40:50,799 --> 04:40:51,799
You just missed him.

3437
04:40:51,799 --> 04:40:52,799
Wow.

3438
04:40:52,799 --> 04:40:53,799
So, hey, me and the Merc with the Mouth,

3439
04:40:53,799 --> 04:40:54,799
let me tell you what I'm going to do today.

3440
04:40:54,799 --> 04:40:55,799
I'm going to take...

3441
04:40:55,799 --> 04:40:56,799
We're going to make pumpkin pie.

3442
04:40:56,799 --> 04:40:57,799
I'll tell you what's going to happen here.

3443
04:40:57,799 --> 04:41:01,520
I've been waiting all week to do this one.

3444
04:41:01,520 --> 04:41:03,520
All right, get in there.

3445
04:41:03,520 --> 04:41:10,939
I don't think I made it.

3446
04:41:10,939 --> 04:41:11,939
I'm assuming it missed.

3447
04:41:11,939 --> 04:41:12,939
I can't tell.

3448
04:41:12,939 --> 04:41:13,939
Ooh, you know what?

3449
04:41:13,939 --> 04:41:15,939
My lips are dry right now.

3450
04:41:15,939 --> 04:41:16,939
Oh, are they?

3451
04:41:16,939 --> 04:41:17,939
What?

3452
04:41:17,939 --> 04:41:18,939
What the fuck is...

3453
04:41:18,939 --> 04:41:21,270
What?

3454
04:41:21,270 --> 04:41:22,270
Did they get...

3455
04:41:22,270 --> 04:41:23,270
I just cut to Jerma doing exercise.

3456
04:41:23,270 --> 04:41:24,270
Wait.

3457
04:41:24,270 --> 04:41:25,270
Wait, what?

3458
04:41:25,270 --> 04:41:26,270
Did they miss that?

3459
04:41:26,270 --> 04:41:27,270
Yeah, it was just Jerma doing this.

3460
04:41:27,270 --> 04:41:28,270
Did they miss that shot?

3461
04:41:28,270 --> 04:41:29,270
I was preparing.

3462
04:41:29,270 --> 04:41:30,270
I was stretching.

3463
04:41:30,270 --> 04:41:31,270
Yeah, and how about you tell us

3464
04:41:31,270 --> 04:41:32,270
what you have in your pocket earlier?

3465
04:41:32,270 --> 04:41:35,270
Yeah, he's got lip balm on a Q-tip.

3466
04:41:35,270 --> 04:41:36,270
You're actually calling me out for this?

3467
04:41:36,270 --> 04:41:37,270
Yeah, pull it out, man.

3468
04:41:37,270 --> 04:41:38,270
I mean, it's not...

3469
04:41:38,270 --> 04:41:39,270
Pull it out.

3470
04:41:39,270 --> 04:41:40,270
So, it's...

3471
04:41:40,270 --> 04:41:41,270
This looks fucking weird.

3472
04:41:41,270 --> 04:41:42,270
I saw him using that.

3473
04:41:42,270 --> 04:41:44,270
That is a dab that you smoke weed out of.

3474
04:41:44,270 --> 04:41:45,270
No, this is not drugs.

3475
04:41:45,270 --> 04:41:48,270
It's in a drug baggie, but it doesn't mean it's drugs.

3476
04:41:49,270 --> 04:41:54,220
Jerma?

3477
04:42:04,470 --> 04:42:06,090
We won.

3478
04:42:06,090 --> 04:42:08,229
You lose, that's it.

3479
04:42:08,229 --> 04:42:09,229
No, you lose.

3480
04:42:09,229 --> 04:42:10,229
Sorry, sorry.

3481
04:42:10,229 --> 04:42:11,229
Hey, congratulations, guys.

3482
04:42:11,229 --> 04:42:12,229
Yes, thank you.

3483
04:42:12,229 --> 04:42:13,229
Congratulations, guys.

3484
04:42:13,229 --> 04:42:14,229
Thank you.

3485
04:42:14,229 --> 04:42:15,229
Thank you.

3486
04:42:15,229 --> 04:42:16,229
Congratulations, you guys.

3487
04:42:16,229 --> 04:42:17,229
I just won.

3488
04:42:17,229 --> 04:42:18,400
That's it.

3489
04:42:18,400 --> 04:42:19,400
Got it under control, though.

3490
04:42:19,400 --> 04:42:20,400
I'm going to land this.

3491
04:42:20,400 --> 04:42:21,400
It's going to be an S-tier pilot, by the way.

3492
04:42:21,400 --> 04:42:22,400
I want you all to do your reviews.

3493
04:42:22,400 --> 04:42:23,400
I want you to say thanks for the S-tier landing.

3494
04:42:23,400 --> 04:42:24,400
And have a great rest of your evening.

3495
04:42:24,400 --> 04:42:25,400
Landing show.

3496
04:42:25,400 --> 04:42:26,400
Okay.

3497
04:42:26,400 --> 04:42:27,400
Oh, my God.

3498
04:42:27,400 --> 04:42:28,400
Okay.

3499
04:42:28,400 --> 04:42:29,770
Okay.

3500
04:42:29,770 --> 04:42:30,770
Okay.

3501
04:42:30,770 --> 04:42:31,770
Don't worry.

3502
04:42:31,770 --> 04:42:32,770
Oh, my God.

3503
04:42:32,770 --> 04:42:33,770
Jerma?

3504
04:42:33,770 --> 04:42:34,770
Yeah?

3505
04:42:34,770 --> 04:42:35,770
If we don't make it out of this one?

3506
04:42:35,770 --> 04:42:36,770
Yep.

3507
04:42:36,770 --> 04:42:37,770
I just want to let you know, you're a great pilot, okay?

3508
04:42:37,770 --> 04:42:38,770
Thank you so much.

3509
04:42:38,770 --> 04:42:39,770
This may require both of us.

3510
04:42:39,770 --> 04:42:40,770
All right?

3511
04:42:40,770 --> 04:42:41,770
By the way, I've got a bag under my back that has 50 grand in it.

3512
04:42:41,770 --> 04:42:42,770
What?

3513
04:42:42,770 --> 04:42:43,770
I'm just making sure somebody knows.

3514
04:42:43,770 --> 04:42:44,770
40.

3515
04:42:44,770 --> 04:42:45,770
Push back.

3516
04:42:45,770 --> 04:42:46,770
Oh, boy.

3517
04:42:46,770 --> 04:42:48,270
Okay, push back.

3518
04:42:48,270 --> 04:42:49,270
Okay.

3519
04:42:49,270 --> 04:42:50,270
Hold on.

3520
04:42:50,270 --> 04:42:51,270
To the side.

3521
04:42:51,270 --> 04:42:52,270
There you go.

3522
04:42:52,270 --> 04:42:53,270
30.

3523
04:42:53,270 --> 04:42:54,270
Oh, my God.

3524
04:42:54,270 --> 04:42:55,270
Oh, Jesus Christ.

3525
04:42:55,270 --> 04:42:56,270
Oh, my God.

3526
04:42:56,270 --> 04:42:57,270
Oh, my God.

3527
04:42:57,270 --> 04:42:58,270
Oh, my God.

3528
04:42:58,270 --> 04:42:59,270
Oh, my God.

3529
04:43:00,270 --> 04:43:01,270
Oh, Jesus Christ.

3530
04:43:01,270 --> 04:43:02,270
All right.

3531
04:43:02,270 --> 04:43:03,270
We're okay.

3532
04:43:03,270 --> 04:43:04,270
We're all right.

3533
04:43:04,270 --> 04:43:05,270
We're all right.

3534
04:43:05,270 --> 04:43:06,270
We're all right.

3535
04:43:06,270 --> 04:43:07,270
Oh, my God.

3536
04:43:07,270 --> 04:43:08,270
Oh, my God.

3537
04:43:08,270 --> 04:43:09,270
We're all right.

3538
04:43:09,270 --> 04:43:10,270
We're good.

3539
04:43:10,270 --> 04:43:11,270
Oh, God.

3540
04:43:11,270 --> 04:43:12,270
We're on the ground.

3541
04:43:12,270 --> 04:43:13,270
Oh, we made it.

3542
04:43:13,270 --> 04:43:14,270
We're on the ground.

3543
04:43:14,270 --> 04:43:15,270
We made it.

3544
04:43:15,270 --> 04:43:16,270
Oh, my God.

3545
04:43:16,270 --> 04:43:17,270
I may have switched my balls.

3546
04:43:17,270 --> 04:43:18,270
Oh, my God.

3547
04:43:18,270 --> 04:43:19,270
Okay.

3548
04:43:19,270 --> 04:43:20,270
Hey, wait a minute.

3549
04:43:20,270 --> 04:43:21,270
We got a guest here.

3550
04:43:21,270 --> 04:43:22,270
We got the amazing Jerma.

3551
04:43:22,270 --> 04:43:23,270
Everybody clap.

3552
04:43:23,270 --> 04:43:24,270
Oh, my God.

3553
04:43:24,270 --> 04:43:25,270
Oh, my God.

3554
04:43:25,270 --> 04:43:26,270
Oh, my God.

3555
04:43:26,270 --> 04:43:27,270
Oh, my God.

3556
04:43:27,270 --> 04:43:30,110
Oh, my God.

3557
04:43:30,110 --> 04:43:31,110
Oh, my God.

3558
04:43:31,110 --> 04:43:32,110
I expect a wonderful time to see you.

3559
04:43:32,110 --> 04:43:33,110
Yes.

3560
04:43:33,110 --> 04:43:34,110
Sit here?

3561
04:43:34,110 --> 04:43:35,110
Yeah, you may sit there.

3562
04:43:35,110 --> 04:43:36,110
Okay.

3563
04:43:36,110 --> 04:43:37,110
Sit here.

3564
04:43:37,110 --> 04:43:41,110
Now, I hear you put on the biggest production of Guys and Dolls Twitch has ever seen.

3565
04:43:41,110 --> 04:43:42,110
Well, you know, they're close.

3566
04:43:42,110 --> 04:43:43,110
Who's this tweet about?

3567
04:43:43,110 --> 04:43:44,110
All right.

3568
04:43:44,110 --> 04:43:47,110
Is it a reply to Jerma985?

3569
04:43:47,110 --> 04:43:48,110
All right.

3570
04:43:48,110 --> 04:43:52,110
Or is it a reply to Super Galactic porn star Mia Malkova?

3571
04:43:52,110 --> 04:43:54,110
That fat, juicy ass.

3572
04:43:54,110 --> 04:43:56,110
Fat spelled with a P-H.

3573
04:43:56,110 --> 04:43:57,110
P-H.

3574
04:43:57,110 --> 04:43:59,599
Which is the good.

3575
04:43:59,599 --> 04:44:00,599
Yeah.

3576
04:44:00,599 --> 04:44:03,599
I'm going to say 2020.

3577
04:44:03,599 --> 04:44:05,599
I'm going to say this is about me.

3578
04:44:05,599 --> 04:44:06,599
Wow.

3579
04:44:06,599 --> 04:44:07,599
All right.

3580
04:44:07,599 --> 04:44:08,599
What do you think, Donna?

3581
04:44:08,599 --> 04:44:10,479
Am I missing something?

3582
04:44:10,479 --> 04:44:12,479
I'm going to say Mia Malkova.

3583
04:44:12,479 --> 04:44:17,479
I would like to say Jerma is a little full of himself.

3584
04:44:17,479 --> 04:44:18,479
It is Mia Malkova.

3585
04:44:18,479 --> 04:44:19,479
Yeah.

3586
04:44:19,479 --> 04:44:22,479
But I mean, that's all I have to be.

3587
04:44:22,479 --> 04:44:26,479
I wondered by one of that tweet of me showing my ass in the mirror.

3588
04:44:26,479 --> 04:44:27,479
What?

3589
04:44:27,479 --> 04:44:29,479
Anyway, let's take a look at some of our competitors.

3590
04:44:29,479 --> 04:44:34,110
Jerma, what question did you ask me earlier?

3591
04:44:34,110 --> 04:44:37,110
I asked you what the accelerate button was.

3592
04:44:37,110 --> 04:44:38,110
Who's your teammate?

3593
04:44:38,110 --> 04:44:39,729
You.

3594
04:44:39,729 --> 04:44:40,729
OK.

3595
04:44:40,729 --> 04:44:41,729
Let's go see how other people are doing.

3596
04:44:41,729 --> 04:44:42,729
Are you sipping it right now?

3597
04:44:42,729 --> 04:44:43,729
No.

3598
04:44:43,729 --> 04:44:44,729
I just opened it.

3599
04:44:44,729 --> 04:44:45,729
It's harder to chug a cold beer.

3600
04:44:45,729 --> 04:44:46,729
You know that.

3601
04:44:46,729 --> 04:44:48,729
But it tastes better.

3602
04:44:48,729 --> 04:44:51,729
You don't chug for taste.

3603
04:44:51,729 --> 04:44:52,729
Everything is taste.

3604
04:44:52,729 --> 04:44:53,729
Everything.

3605
04:44:53,729 --> 04:44:54,729
You can't just chug.

3606
04:44:54,729 --> 04:44:55,729
What do you mean, taste?

3607
04:44:55,729 --> 04:44:57,970
This is a typical Golden Knights fan.

3608
04:44:57,970 --> 04:44:59,970
They almost won the goddamn Stanley Cup the first year, by the way.

3609
04:44:59,970 --> 04:45:00,970
They did.

3610
04:45:00,970 --> 04:45:01,970
Almost.

3611
04:45:01,970 --> 04:45:02,970
How long ago was that?

3612
04:45:02,970 --> 04:45:03,970
That's not great.

3613
04:45:03,970 --> 04:45:04,970
You don't love that for them.

3614
04:45:04,970 --> 04:45:07,970
I used to do that when it turned out.

3615
04:45:07,970 --> 04:45:09,970
By the way, I don't really like Mario Kart.

3616
04:45:09,970 --> 04:45:10,970
Let me be very honest.

3617
04:45:10,970 --> 04:45:11,970
What?

3618
04:45:11,970 --> 04:45:12,970
Why did you accept doing this?

3619
04:45:12,970 --> 04:45:14,970
Because I think you're cool.

3620
04:45:14,970 --> 04:45:15,970
Really?

3621
04:45:15,970 --> 04:45:16,970
Yeah.

3622
04:45:16,970 --> 04:45:17,970
Oh, thank you.

3623
04:45:17,970 --> 04:45:19,970
Statistically, those ones do, actually.

3624
04:45:19,970 --> 04:45:20,970
No, exactly.

3625
04:45:20,970 --> 04:45:24,470
I'm thinking about fucking Toad in this next last round.

3626
04:45:24,470 --> 04:45:26,470
You want to fuck Toad?

3627
04:45:26,470 --> 04:45:28,470
Is that what he does?

3628
04:45:35,150 --> 04:45:42,540
I will say something before I open this, that thanks to all the other streamers that let

3629
04:45:42,540 --> 04:45:47,159
me kind of participate in their shows, because it's fun.

3630
04:45:47,159 --> 04:45:49,159
And I hope that you liked it.

3631
04:45:49,159 --> 04:45:53,159
I hope you thought it was fun, maybe me participating in everything.

3632
04:45:53,159 --> 04:45:55,159
I did a lot of stuff this year.

3633
04:45:55,159 --> 04:45:59,159
So there's a lot of people doing really, really cool shit on these platforms.

3634
04:45:59,159 --> 04:46:03,159
So it's an honor to be able to participate and have fun.

3635
04:46:03,159 --> 04:46:04,159
So thank you.

3636
04:46:04,159 --> 04:46:07,470
Thank you to all these nominees, everybody that's in here.

3637
04:46:07,470 --> 04:46:08,470
It's been a lot of fun.

3638
04:46:08,470 --> 04:46:09,470
It has.

3639
04:46:09,470 --> 04:46:10,470
Thank you.

3640
04:46:10,470 --> 04:46:11,470
I actually do mean that.

3641
04:46:11,470 --> 04:46:14,470
Thank you so much for letting me be part of your cool shit.

3642
04:46:14,470 --> 04:46:18,470
But what was everybody's favorite?

3643
04:46:18,470 --> 04:46:19,470
They're all good.

3644
04:46:19,470 --> 04:46:21,409
What do we got here?

3645
04:46:21,409 --> 04:46:24,409
Who was the favorite collab of the year?

3646
04:46:24,409 --> 04:46:27,720
Ladies and gentlemen, it is...

3647
04:46:27,720 --> 04:46:29,720
Ooh, close.

3648
04:46:29,720 --> 04:46:32,150
28% of the vote.

3649
04:46:32,150 --> 04:46:36,150
And then two was 25.6.

3650
04:46:36,150 --> 04:46:43,779
Number one was Tommy Time with Critical, which was so much fun.

3651
04:46:43,779 --> 04:46:45,779
That whole group is so awesome.

3652
04:46:45,779 --> 04:46:47,779
That was an unbelievable experience.

3653
04:46:47,779 --> 04:46:51,779
Name your price with Austin Show at number two.

3654
04:46:51,779 --> 04:46:55,779
And then Bro versus Bro, Bro versus Bro, with Ludwig, Bro versus Bro.

3655
04:46:55,779 --> 04:46:57,779
Ludwig is here.

3656
04:46:57,779 --> 04:47:01,779
So Ludwig, you came in third place on Best Collab Stream.

3657
04:47:01,779 --> 04:47:05,240
I don't know if he's even here anymore.

3658
04:47:05,240 --> 04:47:08,240
But yeah, that means a lot.

3659
04:47:08,240 --> 04:47:11,240
It means a lot to be able to be a part of other people's shows.

3660
04:47:11,240 --> 04:47:13,240
I hope I made them more fun.

3661
04:47:13,240 --> 04:47:16,240
And if I didn't, then maybe I won't get a callback.

3662
04:47:16,240 --> 04:47:18,729
All right.

3663
04:47:18,729 --> 04:47:20,040
All right.

3664
04:47:20,040 --> 04:47:21,040
Don't get sentimental.

3665
04:47:21,040 --> 04:47:22,040
Don't start crying.

3666
04:47:22,040 --> 04:47:24,040
There's a lot of people watching you.

3667
04:47:24,040 --> 04:47:26,340
You've probably heard that weird burp.

3668
04:47:26,340 --> 04:47:28,340
We're getting to the last two categories.

3669
04:47:28,340 --> 04:47:29,340
There's only two left.

3670
04:47:29,340 --> 04:47:34,340
There's Best Overall Stream or Series and Best Overall Event.

3671
04:47:34,340 --> 04:47:37,340
We can start with this one here.

3672
04:47:37,340 --> 04:47:41,340
It's been kind of a wild year and there's a lot to go over.

3673
04:47:41,340 --> 04:47:45,580
So I guess I don't need to introduce this too much.

3674
04:47:45,580 --> 04:47:51,580
This is the nominees for the Best Stream or Stream Series of the year.

3675
04:47:51,580 --> 04:47:53,580
And here they are.

3676
04:47:53,580 --> 04:48:02,799
You guys are losing your fucking minds.

3677
04:48:02,799 --> 04:48:05,229
It's not a log splitter.

3678
04:48:05,229 --> 04:48:06,229
What the...

3679
04:48:06,229 --> 04:48:08,229
What is happening in this chat room?

3680
04:48:08,229 --> 04:48:10,229
Look up a Google image of a log splitter.

3681
04:48:10,229 --> 04:48:13,229
I'm fucking freaking out right now.

3682
04:48:13,229 --> 04:48:16,939
Log splitter.

3683
04:48:23,529 --> 04:48:25,529
He's a based socialist.

3684
04:48:34,159 --> 04:48:36,159
Ow.

3685
04:48:37,159 --> 04:48:38,159
Job!

3686
04:48:38,159 --> 04:48:39,159
What?

3687
04:48:40,159 --> 04:48:41,159
What the fuck?

3688
04:48:41,159 --> 04:48:44,090
What am I supposed to do?

3689
04:48:44,090 --> 04:48:50,569
Guys, blue flash means an attack is unpairable.

3690
04:48:50,569 --> 04:48:56,450
Guys, when Ben Franklin was writing up the fucking Declaration of Independence,

3691
04:48:56,450 --> 04:48:59,450
there was no Guggerda Guggerda in there.

3692
04:48:59,450 --> 04:49:04,450
Oh yeah, we also need to make sure to leave some room for Guggerda Guggerda Guggerda Guggerda Guggerda Guggerda.

3693
04:49:04,450 --> 04:49:06,450
There's no room for that, Ben.

3694
04:49:15,990 --> 04:49:22,279
Where are the jokes?

3695
04:49:22,279 --> 04:49:23,279
Where are the jokes?

3696
04:49:23,279 --> 04:49:27,279
They bemoaned, they screamed, they gnashed their teeth and said, entertain us.

3697
04:49:27,279 --> 04:49:28,279
Right?

3698
04:49:28,279 --> 04:49:33,639
Is it there?

3699
04:49:33,639 --> 04:49:35,520
Alright.

3700
04:49:35,520 --> 04:49:36,520
What?

3701
04:49:45,720 --> 04:49:46,720
The dev.

3702
04:49:46,720 --> 04:49:48,720
The dev is even sick of this joke.

3703
04:49:48,720 --> 04:49:51,720
The dev is like, alright, it's kind of funny, but like, fucking hurry up.

3704
04:49:51,720 --> 04:49:52,720
Whoa, watch out!

3705
04:49:52,720 --> 04:49:53,720
My thumb!

3706
04:49:53,720 --> 04:49:55,799
Hold on.

3707
04:49:55,799 --> 04:49:59,470
Ow!

3708
04:50:06,020 --> 04:50:07,020
Hold on, I can't see.

3709
04:50:07,020 --> 04:50:08,020
The camera got messed up.

3710
04:50:08,020 --> 04:50:09,020
Steve, go on the road.

3711
04:50:09,020 --> 04:50:11,020
You're driving on the wrong side of the road, Steve.

3712
04:50:11,020 --> 04:50:13,900
Steve, you need to be on the right side of the road.

3713
04:50:13,900 --> 04:50:16,900
Otherwise, my fucked up plan is you're stuck in the middle.

3714
04:50:16,900 --> 04:50:20,200
Steve, you're stuck in the middle of the road, Steve.

3715
04:50:22,200 --> 04:50:31,439
It's too dark!

3716
04:50:34,900 --> 04:50:44,330
I need a handful.

3717
04:50:44,330 --> 04:50:47,299
Disgusting.

3718
04:50:47,299 --> 04:50:49,950
I'm kind of curious.

3719
04:50:49,950 --> 04:50:50,950
I'm curious.

3720
04:50:50,950 --> 04:50:51,950
Let's go.

3721
04:50:51,950 --> 04:51:05,259
It tastes like hamburger meat.

3722
04:51:05,259 --> 04:51:06,259
It tastes like hamburger meat.

3723
04:51:06,259 --> 04:51:08,259
I can't even eat it now.

3724
04:51:08,259 --> 04:51:09,259
Oh, why'd you do that?

3725
04:51:09,259 --> 04:51:10,259
This was S.

3726
04:51:10,259 --> 04:51:11,259
This was S.

3727
04:51:11,259 --> 04:51:13,259
I was going to put it in S.

3728
04:51:13,259 --> 04:51:17,259
And now I'm like, there's a pregnancy test in my mouth.

3729
04:51:17,259 --> 04:51:18,259
What the fuck?

3730
04:51:18,259 --> 04:51:24,430
I don't know why I just felt like I was being held hostage.

3731
04:51:24,430 --> 04:51:26,860
This is fucking weird.

3732
04:51:26,860 --> 04:51:27,860
I would...

3733
04:51:27,860 --> 04:51:29,860
This is weirdly...

3734
04:51:31,860 --> 04:51:34,860
Oh no, I don't have to do anything because I have magic.

3735
04:51:34,860 --> 04:51:37,860
All the people that aren't magic need to do all the work.

3736
04:51:37,860 --> 04:51:38,860
This game's for fucking kids.

3737
04:51:38,860 --> 04:51:39,860
I don't give a fuck.

3738
04:51:39,860 --> 04:51:44,930
I'm playing a fucking kids game and you guys are fucking shit in the fucking chat.

3739
04:51:45,930 --> 04:51:46,930
Yeah.

3740
04:51:46,930 --> 04:51:47,930
Okay.

3741
04:51:48,930 --> 04:51:50,240
Pickle nose.

3742
04:51:50,240 --> 04:51:51,240
Pickle nose.

3743
04:51:51,240 --> 04:51:53,240
Did you fucking say that?

3744
04:51:54,240 --> 04:51:55,240
Oh shit.

3745
04:51:56,240 --> 04:51:57,799
Oh, this is bad.

3746
04:51:57,799 --> 04:51:58,799
This is bad.

3747
04:51:58,799 --> 04:51:59,799
This is bad.

3748
04:51:59,799 --> 04:52:00,799
This is bad.

3749
04:52:00,799 --> 04:52:01,799
This is bad.

3750
04:52:01,799 --> 04:52:02,799
This is bad.

3751
04:52:02,799 --> 04:52:03,799
This is bad.

3752
04:52:03,799 --> 04:52:05,799
Um, I think we're in trouble.

3753
04:52:05,799 --> 04:52:07,799
I think we're in trouble.

3754
04:52:10,680 --> 04:52:11,680
Whoa!

3755
04:52:12,919 --> 04:52:17,909
Oh shit, it's gonna break.

3756
04:52:21,130 --> 04:52:22,130
Stop doing the Mario.

3757
04:52:23,130 --> 04:52:24,130
I'm sorry.

3758
04:52:24,130 --> 04:52:25,130
I'm sorry, everybody.

3759
04:52:25,130 --> 04:52:26,130
I'm so sorry.

3760
04:52:26,130 --> 04:52:27,130
I'm so sorry.

3761
04:52:27,130 --> 04:52:29,130
Just doing the Mario thing.

3762
04:52:36,130 --> 04:52:38,130
That person's trashed.

3763
04:52:42,130 --> 04:52:44,130
I didn't call it a cookie.

3764
04:52:47,130 --> 04:52:51,130
In a few minutes, we'll tell you about a $40 million giveaway promotion.

3765
04:52:51,130 --> 04:52:55,130
You can get a fabulous rocket ship for a friend and settle during the next few minutes.

3766
04:52:55,130 --> 04:52:56,130
No way.

3767
04:52:56,130 --> 04:52:57,130
No.

3768
04:52:57,130 --> 04:53:00,310
But try to flip and food flops.

3769
04:53:00,310 --> 04:53:01,310
Try to grip and food drops.

3770
04:53:01,310 --> 04:53:02,310
Shit face.

3771
04:53:02,310 --> 04:53:03,310
I'm telling you, shit face.

3772
04:53:03,310 --> 04:53:04,310
You need to flip or turn.

3773
04:53:04,310 --> 04:53:07,189
Are you about to win?

3774
04:53:07,189 --> 04:53:09,189
Oh, it's Seattle.

3775
04:53:09,189 --> 04:53:12,319
God damn it.

3776
04:53:12,319 --> 04:53:13,319
What?

3777
04:53:13,319 --> 04:53:14,319
Houston.

3778
04:53:15,319 --> 04:53:18,819
The space needle was just on there.

3779
04:53:18,819 --> 04:53:19,819
What is it?

3780
04:53:19,819 --> 04:53:20,819
There's a flag right there.

3781
04:53:20,819 --> 04:53:21,819
What is it?

3782
04:53:21,819 --> 04:53:24,819
Oh my God.

3783
04:53:24,819 --> 04:53:25,819
It's Switzerland.

3784
04:53:25,819 --> 04:53:26,819
How many times do you have to do this routine?

3785
04:53:26,819 --> 04:53:28,819
The troll too yell.

3786
04:53:28,819 --> 04:53:29,819
What?

3787
04:53:37,549 --> 04:53:38,549
Whoa!

3788
04:53:38,549 --> 04:53:39,549
I think I saw somebody's dick.

3789
04:53:39,549 --> 04:53:40,549
What was that?

3790
04:53:40,549 --> 04:53:41,549
What was that?

3791
04:53:41,549 --> 04:53:42,549
That was weird.

3792
04:53:42,549 --> 04:53:43,549
What's going on?

3793
04:53:46,549 --> 04:53:47,549
Oh, fuck.

3794
04:53:48,549 --> 04:53:52,520
I'm flying far and quick.

3795
04:53:53,520 --> 04:53:54,520
Wait, did I save it?

3796
04:53:54,520 --> 04:53:55,520
Dude, yeah.

3797
04:54:03,810 --> 04:54:04,810
That fucking face squat.

3798
04:54:04,810 --> 04:54:05,810
God damn it.

3799
04:54:05,810 --> 04:54:06,810
Excuse me?

3800
04:54:07,810 --> 04:54:08,810
Whoa!

3801
04:54:08,810 --> 04:54:09,810
What's happening?

3802
04:54:10,810 --> 04:54:11,810
Somebody's stabbing me.

3803
04:54:11,810 --> 04:54:12,810
What?

3804
04:54:12,810 --> 04:54:13,810
What happened?

3805
04:54:13,810 --> 04:54:15,810
Dude, this is illegal.

3806
04:54:15,810 --> 04:54:16,810
That's illegal.

3807
04:54:20,779 --> 04:54:23,430
Oh my God.

3808
04:54:23,430 --> 04:54:24,990
Hurry up.

3809
04:54:24,990 --> 04:54:25,990
Hurry, hurry.

3810
04:54:25,990 --> 04:54:31,110
I just shit my pants.

3811
04:54:31,110 --> 04:54:32,110
What?

3812
04:54:32,110 --> 04:54:34,110
My popularity is dwindling.

3813
04:54:34,110 --> 04:54:38,110
How am I supposed to do anything when everybody just attacks me?

3814
04:54:38,110 --> 04:54:41,110
What the fuck do you want me to do?

3815
04:54:42,110 --> 04:54:45,590
Where'd he go?

3816
04:54:45,590 --> 04:54:46,590
I missed.

3817
04:54:46,590 --> 04:54:47,590
This was so fun.

3818
04:54:49,470 --> 04:54:51,599
Just a psycho.

3819
04:54:51,599 --> 04:54:52,599
I'm sorry.

3820
04:54:52,599 --> 04:54:54,599
No, I don't mean it.

3821
04:54:54,599 --> 04:54:55,599
I don't.

3822
04:54:55,599 --> 04:54:56,599
All right.

3823
04:54:56,599 --> 04:54:57,599
You can arrest me.

3824
04:54:57,599 --> 04:54:58,599
I don't know.

3825
04:54:58,599 --> 04:54:59,599
This is weird.

3826
04:54:59,599 --> 04:55:00,599
Everybody looking at me.

3827
04:55:00,599 --> 04:55:01,599
Don't look at me.

3828
04:55:01,599 --> 04:55:04,319
What the fuck?

3829
04:55:04,319 --> 04:55:07,900
That's like a monster.

3830
04:55:14,520 --> 04:55:16,520
I was trying to snap his neck.

3831
04:55:16,520 --> 04:55:17,520
I was trying to strangle him.

3832
04:55:17,520 --> 04:55:19,520
I'm trying to strangle him.

3833
04:55:20,520 --> 04:55:23,970
Hey, give me that gun, motherfucker.

3834
04:55:26,240 --> 04:55:27,919
Back.

3835
04:55:27,919 --> 04:55:30,060
God, I'm so sorry.

3836
04:55:30,060 --> 04:55:31,060
Holy shit.

3837
04:55:31,060 --> 04:55:33,060
That was like the worst thing that's ever happened to me.

3838
04:55:33,060 --> 04:55:36,060
He just stole Austin Powers' mojo.

3839
04:55:36,060 --> 04:55:38,060
Jesus.

3840
04:55:38,060 --> 04:55:41,299
Give me a fucking brick.

3841
04:55:41,299 --> 04:55:47,919
That was fucked up.

3842
04:55:47,919 --> 04:55:49,919
That was actually pretty fucked up.

3843
04:55:49,919 --> 04:55:58,319
Score.

3844
04:55:58,319 --> 04:56:00,590
I'm sorry.

3845
04:56:00,590 --> 04:56:01,590
I can't do it.

3846
04:56:01,590 --> 04:56:02,590
What is powering?

3847
04:56:02,590 --> 04:56:03,590
What is powering?

3848
04:56:03,590 --> 04:56:06,590
We have one minute and 15 seconds to go this way.

3849
04:56:08,020 --> 04:56:09,020
So we're going to go up.

3850
04:56:09,020 --> 04:56:10,020
Where did you go?

3851
04:56:10,020 --> 04:56:11,020
We're going up.

3852
04:56:12,020 --> 04:56:13,200
What the hell?

3853
04:56:13,200 --> 04:56:14,880
Oh, coffee.

3854
04:56:16,060 --> 04:56:17,060
Oh, Cheeto.

3855
04:56:18,060 --> 04:56:19,060
Roadie bitch.

3856
04:56:22,060 --> 04:56:23,060
Get off the fucking barrel.

3857
04:56:23,060 --> 04:56:24,060
Get off the barrel.

3858
04:56:24,060 --> 04:56:25,060
That was awful.

3859
04:56:25,060 --> 04:56:26,060
Get off the barrel.

3860
04:56:34,680 --> 04:56:35,680
I don't like this.

3861
04:56:35,680 --> 04:56:36,680
I hate this.

3862
04:56:39,259 --> 04:56:40,259
Oh, holy shit.

3863
04:56:40,259 --> 04:56:43,259
People are so ugly with light, aren't they?

3864
04:56:43,259 --> 04:56:44,259
Holy shit.

3865
04:56:44,259 --> 04:56:45,259
People are so ugly.

3866
04:56:45,259 --> 04:56:46,259
Look at it.

3867
04:56:46,259 --> 04:56:47,259
All right.

3868
04:56:47,259 --> 04:56:48,259
Oh, Jeremy, you look real handsome today.

3869
04:56:48,259 --> 04:56:49,259
You sure about that?

3870
04:56:49,259 --> 04:56:53,189
Oh, no.

3871
04:56:53,189 --> 04:56:56,880
He killed that guy.

3872
04:56:56,880 --> 04:56:57,880
What?

3873
04:56:57,880 --> 04:56:59,880
Oh, my God.

3874
04:56:59,880 --> 04:57:01,880
I am so confused right now.

3875
04:57:02,880 --> 04:57:06,229
There you go.

3876
04:57:06,229 --> 04:57:08,229
I told you it was real.

3877
04:57:08,229 --> 04:57:10,400
Hey, let's do the rest of this with my fucking eyes closed.

3878
04:57:10,400 --> 04:57:11,400
Don't make a joke.

3879
04:57:11,400 --> 04:57:17,830
Stop.

3880
04:57:17,830 --> 04:57:18,830
Oh, my God.

3881
04:57:18,830 --> 04:57:19,830
What am I doing?

3882
04:57:19,830 --> 04:57:20,830
I put you up in a meat grinder.

3883
04:57:20,830 --> 04:57:25,450
And the only thing that comes out that's left of you is your eyeball.

3884
04:57:25,450 --> 04:57:28,450
You're probably dead.

3885
04:57:28,450 --> 04:57:31,450
Now, I don't get that move at all.

3886
04:57:31,450 --> 04:57:34,450
That move is absolutely unbelievable.

3887
04:57:34,450 --> 04:57:36,450
It's one of those moves that you can't do anything about.

3888
04:57:36,450 --> 04:57:38,450
And I'm telling you, yeah.

3889
04:57:38,450 --> 04:57:40,450
But you know what else is as ridiculous as that?

3890
04:57:40,450 --> 04:57:42,450
Yeah, like we're going to get planes soon.

3891
04:57:42,450 --> 04:57:44,450
They're going to be like I could fly eventually, too.

3892
04:57:45,450 --> 04:57:56,279
So those are your nominees for best stream or stream series of the year.

3893
04:57:56,279 --> 04:57:58,479
I feel like there are a lot of good ones.

3894
04:57:58,479 --> 04:58:00,479
I feel like there was a lot of fun this year.

3895
04:58:00,479 --> 04:58:02,790
I say that every year, but I do mean it.

3896
04:58:02,790 --> 04:58:04,790
And let's see.

3897
04:58:04,790 --> 04:58:06,790
I'm going to start crying on camera.

3898
04:58:06,790 --> 04:58:07,790
Right?

3899
04:58:07,790 --> 04:58:08,790
I'm going to start crying.

3900
04:58:08,790 --> 04:58:09,790
I'm going to cry.

3901
04:58:09,790 --> 04:58:10,790
It's going to happen.

3902
04:58:10,790 --> 04:58:11,790
Just wait.

3903
04:58:11,790 --> 04:58:12,790
All right.

3904
04:58:12,790 --> 04:58:19,790
Ladies and gentlemen, the what you have decided was the best stream or stream series of the year.

3905
04:58:21,349 --> 04:58:22,349
Oh, the misery.

3906
04:58:22,349 --> 04:58:23,349
No.

3907
04:58:23,349 --> 04:58:26,349
Elden Ring at 27.2 percent.

3908
04:58:26,349 --> 04:58:31,349
And let me tell you, it makes sense considering I streamed that game for almost two straight months.

3909
04:58:32,349 --> 04:58:38,360
There was a high chance it was going to be Elden Ring because it was a third of every stream I did this year.

3910
04:58:38,360 --> 04:58:41,919
And also a game of the year, by the way.

3911
04:58:41,919 --> 04:58:44,919
Elden Ring at 27.2.

3912
04:58:44,919 --> 04:58:47,919
Underneath that is infomercial React Andy.

3913
04:58:47,919 --> 04:58:54,919
I'm going to have to do more of those React Andy streams because OK.

3914
04:58:54,919 --> 04:58:59,919
And then I didn't even beat Breath of the Wild yet, but Breath of the Wild number three.

3915
04:58:59,919 --> 04:59:03,229
By the way, this is second most least skipped category.

3916
04:59:03,229 --> 04:59:05,229
So people wanted to vote for this.

3917
04:59:05,229 --> 04:59:10,229
But Elden Ring, obviously Elden Ring swept everything, swept the game awards, swept my awards.

3918
04:59:10,229 --> 04:59:11,229
Right.

3919
04:59:11,229 --> 04:59:13,229
So obviously it's going to win.

3920
04:59:13,229 --> 04:59:14,229
And it was so fun.

3921
04:59:14,229 --> 04:59:18,229
Those are some of the honestly those are some of the funnest streams I had.

3922
04:59:18,229 --> 04:59:21,790
I think ever on the channel.

3923
04:59:21,790 --> 04:59:25,029
That game just had so many fun moments.

3924
04:59:25,029 --> 04:59:27,029
Once in a generation, you get it.

3925
04:59:27,029 --> 04:59:28,520
All right.

3926
04:59:28,520 --> 04:59:31,340
Ladies and gentlemen, it is time.

3927
04:59:31,340 --> 04:59:37,580
We are approaching the final category, which it's a small category, but it's fun to do.

3928
04:59:37,580 --> 04:59:43,759
The last category of the evening is best overall stream event.

3929
04:59:43,759 --> 04:59:46,060
There was only about four or five this year.

3930
04:59:46,060 --> 04:59:49,060
I love doing events.

3931
04:59:49,060 --> 04:59:50,060
I think they're fun.

3932
04:59:50,060 --> 04:59:51,060
Get people together.

3933
04:59:51,060 --> 04:59:52,060
Have a good time.

3934
04:59:52,060 --> 04:59:54,060
This is an event.

3935
04:59:54,060 --> 04:59:56,060
Can't vote for this, though.

3936
04:59:56,060 --> 04:59:58,060
But hey, maybe you can next year.

3937
04:59:58,060 --> 05:00:01,060
Hey, maybe jot it down for, you know, best event of the year.

3938
05:00:01,060 --> 05:00:05,060
The German 95 holiday Christmas stream.

3939
05:00:05,060 --> 05:00:06,060
But yeah, this is going to be it.

3940
05:00:06,060 --> 05:00:11,060
This is the last category of the evening is what you thought the best stream of the year was.

3941
05:00:11,060 --> 05:00:13,060
That was an event stream.

3942
05:00:13,060 --> 05:00:14,060
We did non-event.

3943
05:00:14,060 --> 05:00:16,060
Here is event.

3944
05:00:16,060 --> 05:00:18,750
Here are your nominees.

3945
05:00:18,750 --> 05:00:23,119
Most least.

3946
05:00:23,119 --> 05:00:31,650
So what I've decided to do is over the last few months, we've scoured the country.

3947
05:00:31,650 --> 05:00:37,650
Trying to find who I think could potentially be able to replace me.

3948
05:00:37,650 --> 05:00:40,650
And a little bit of Ashby.

3949
05:00:40,650 --> 05:00:41,650
All right.

3950
05:00:41,650 --> 05:00:43,279
Great.

3951
05:00:43,279 --> 05:00:45,959
And another one here.

3952
05:00:45,959 --> 05:00:46,959
Ashby.

3953
05:00:46,959 --> 05:00:47,959
All right.

3954
05:00:47,959 --> 05:00:48,959
Then we got a little.

3955
05:00:48,959 --> 05:00:49,959
Might be a little too much.

3956
05:00:49,959 --> 05:00:50,959
A little bit too much Ashby.

3957
05:00:50,959 --> 05:00:51,959
I would pull back on Ashby.

3958
05:00:51,959 --> 05:00:52,959
Pull back on Ashby.

3959
05:00:52,959 --> 05:00:53,959
All right.

3960
05:00:53,959 --> 05:00:54,959
You got it.

3961
05:00:54,959 --> 05:00:57,959
Everybody had three jokes.

3962
05:00:57,959 --> 05:01:00,720
The rats.

3963
05:01:00,720 --> 05:01:02,720
We're the rats.

3964
05:01:02,720 --> 05:01:04,959
We pray.

3965
05:01:04,959 --> 05:01:07,959
At night, we stalk.

3966
05:01:07,959 --> 05:01:11,959
At night, we're the rats.

3967
05:01:11,959 --> 05:01:12,959
You think you can beat me?

3968
05:01:12,959 --> 05:01:13,959
I know I can beat you.

3969
05:01:13,959 --> 05:01:14,959
I don't know what I'm going to beat you at.

3970
05:01:14,959 --> 05:01:15,959
Oh, you know you can beat me.

3971
05:01:15,959 --> 05:01:16,959
I will.

3972
05:01:16,959 --> 05:01:17,959
Go ahead and cue the music.

3973
05:01:17,959 --> 05:01:18,959
Good luck.

3974
05:01:18,959 --> 05:01:21,959
Weird monopoly man.

3975
05:01:21,959 --> 05:01:30,040
Swedish monopoly man.

3976
05:01:30,040 --> 05:01:31,040
What is planned?

3977
05:01:31,040 --> 05:01:33,040
You guys synchronized this?

3978
05:01:33,040 --> 05:01:34,040
10 years.

3979
05:01:34,040 --> 05:01:35,040
We've had TF2.

3980
05:01:35,040 --> 05:01:36,040
Look at me.

3981
05:01:36,040 --> 05:01:37,040
Look at me.

3982
05:01:37,040 --> 05:01:38,040
Look at me.

3983
05:01:38,040 --> 05:01:39,040
That's me.

3984
05:01:39,040 --> 05:01:40,040
I just want you to know.

3985
05:01:40,040 --> 05:01:41,040
You can Google all that.

3986
05:01:41,040 --> 05:01:42,040
He knows nothing.

3987
05:01:42,040 --> 05:01:44,040
I could tell who it was the whole time.

3988
05:01:44,040 --> 05:01:45,040
What?

3989
05:01:45,040 --> 05:01:46,669
Oh.

3990
05:01:46,669 --> 05:01:48,099
You shot.

3991
05:01:48,099 --> 05:01:49,099
Good job.

3992
05:01:49,099 --> 05:01:50,099
You shot him.

3993
05:01:50,099 --> 05:01:51,099
You're not.

3994
05:01:51,099 --> 05:01:52,099
You just got it.

3995
05:01:52,099 --> 05:01:53,099
You just got it.

3996
05:01:53,099 --> 05:01:54,099
Hey everybody.

3997
05:01:54,099 --> 05:01:55,099
What's going on?

3998
05:01:55,099 --> 05:01:56,099
It's me, the sus guy.

3999
05:01:56,099 --> 05:01:57,099
I've been muted this whole time.

4000
05:01:57,099 --> 05:01:58,279
It feels weird.

4001
05:01:58,279 --> 05:01:59,279
Emergency meeting.

4002
05:02:00,279 --> 05:02:01,279
We can watch the door.

4003
05:02:01,279 --> 05:02:02,279
We'll watch the door.

4004
05:02:02,279 --> 05:02:03,279
You take care of your task.

4005
05:02:03,279 --> 05:02:04,279
No one's coming through this.

4006
05:02:04,279 --> 05:02:05,279
You're safe.

4007
05:02:05,279 --> 05:02:08,439
It's these two.

4008
05:02:08,439 --> 05:02:10,639
It's definitely these two.

4009
05:02:10,639 --> 05:02:11,639
It's these two.

4010
05:02:11,639 --> 05:02:12,639
It's definitely these two.

4011
05:02:12,639 --> 05:02:13,639
It's these two.

4012
05:02:13,639 --> 05:02:14,639
No.

4013
05:02:14,639 --> 05:02:15,639
It's these two.

4014
05:02:15,639 --> 05:02:16,639
It's these two.

4015
05:02:16,639 --> 05:02:17,639
Help.

4016
05:02:17,639 --> 05:02:18,639
Okay.

4017
05:02:18,639 --> 05:02:19,639
So press the, what do you have?

4018
05:02:19,639 --> 05:02:20,639
An index?

4019
05:02:20,639 --> 05:02:21,639
A button?

4020
05:02:21,639 --> 05:02:22,639
Kill him.

4021
05:02:22,639 --> 05:02:23,639
Kill him.

4022
05:02:23,639 --> 05:02:24,639
I can't do it.

4023
05:02:24,639 --> 05:02:25,639
Kill him.

4024
05:02:25,639 --> 05:02:26,639
I don't know how to do it.

4025
05:02:26,639 --> 05:02:27,639
Kill him.

4026
05:02:27,639 --> 05:02:28,639
I don't know how to do it.

4027
05:02:28,639 --> 05:02:30,580
Kill him.

4028
05:02:30,580 --> 05:02:31,580
Kill him.

4029
05:02:31,580 --> 05:02:32,580
I can't do it.

4030
05:02:32,580 --> 05:02:33,580
I don't know how to do it.

4031
05:02:33,580 --> 05:02:34,580
Kill him.

4032
05:02:34,580 --> 05:02:35,580
How do you do it?

4033
05:02:35,580 --> 05:02:36,580
Do it.

4034
05:02:36,580 --> 05:02:37,580
Kill him.

4035
05:02:37,580 --> 05:02:38,580
I don't know how to do it.

4036
05:02:38,580 --> 05:02:39,580
30 seconds before you can kill.

4037
05:02:39,580 --> 05:02:41,200
What?

4038
05:02:41,200 --> 05:02:42,200
What are you doing?

4039
05:02:42,200 --> 05:02:43,200
What?

4040
05:02:43,200 --> 05:02:44,200
I agree.

4041
05:02:44,200 --> 05:02:45,200
Get this guy out of here.

4042
05:02:45,200 --> 05:02:46,200
Get this guy out of here.

4043
05:02:46,200 --> 05:02:47,200
Get this guy out of here.

4044
05:02:47,200 --> 05:02:51,700
How do we get, how do we get, how do we get this guy out of here?

4045
05:02:51,700 --> 05:02:52,700
I turned around.

4046
05:02:52,700 --> 05:02:53,700
Criken jump scared me.

4047
05:02:53,700 --> 05:02:54,700
No one's listening.

4048
05:02:54,700 --> 05:02:55,700
I'm listening.

4049
05:02:55,700 --> 05:02:56,700
Okay.

4050
05:02:56,700 --> 05:02:57,700
I should probably be on this camera.

4051
05:02:57,700 --> 05:02:58,700
No.

4052
05:02:58,700 --> 05:02:59,700
He, he.

4053
05:02:59,700 --> 05:03:00,700
I should look directly at you.

4054
05:03:00,700 --> 05:03:01,700
Okay.

4055
05:03:01,700 --> 05:03:02,700
All right.

4056
05:03:03,200 --> 05:03:04,200
Okay.

4057
05:03:04,200 --> 05:03:05,200
Okay.

4058
05:03:05,200 --> 05:03:06,200
It's my birthday.

4059
05:03:06,200 --> 05:03:07,200
Everyone quiet.

4060
05:03:07,200 --> 05:03:08,200
Sir.

4061
05:03:08,200 --> 05:03:09,200
Happy birthday.

4062
05:03:09,200 --> 05:03:10,200
So.

4063
05:03:10,200 --> 05:03:11,200
By the way, can I just say.

4064
05:03:11,200 --> 05:03:12,200
I should be on the live camera for this one.

4065
05:03:12,200 --> 05:03:13,200
No.

4066
05:03:13,200 --> 05:03:14,200
This is.

4067
05:03:14,200 --> 05:03:15,200
No.

4068
05:03:15,200 --> 05:03:16,200
No.

4069
05:03:16,200 --> 05:03:17,200
We have 47 seconds.

4070
05:03:17,200 --> 05:03:18,200
There's only 40 seconds.

4071
05:03:18,200 --> 05:03:25,020
Welcome to Car Shield Field where we have Germa Baseball Association action for you

4072
05:03:25,020 --> 05:03:26,020
tonight.

4073
05:03:26,020 --> 05:03:31,900
A big time matchup between the California Circus and the Maryland Magicians.

4074
05:03:31,900 --> 05:03:35,060
Do you like that, that call from Elbertson behind home plate?

4075
05:03:35,060 --> 05:03:41,020
Sometimes you're not sure where the pitch missed, Elbertson always lets you know.

4076
05:03:41,020 --> 05:03:42,020
Big magic slowly.

4077
05:03:42,020 --> 05:03:43,020
Oh.

4078
05:03:43,020 --> 05:03:44,259
What a play.

4079
05:03:44,259 --> 05:03:47,259
Oh, we got a first pie in the face.

4080
05:03:47,259 --> 05:03:48,259
Oh.

4081
05:03:48,259 --> 05:03:49,259
Elbertson.

4082
05:03:49,259 --> 05:03:50,259
Pie in the face.

4083
05:03:50,259 --> 05:03:51,259
Elbertson.

4084
05:03:51,259 --> 05:03:52,259
The circus.

4085
05:03:52,259 --> 05:03:54,259
What did that play call dad because.

4086
05:03:54,259 --> 05:03:56,259
Oh, and he is tossed.

4087
05:03:56,259 --> 05:03:57,259
Is this.

4088
05:03:57,259 --> 05:03:58,259
Oh.

4089
05:03:58,259 --> 05:03:59,259
We, we've got a streaker.

4090
05:03:59,259 --> 05:04:02,259
We've got a streaker ladies and gentlemen.

4091
05:04:03,139 --> 05:04:06,139
Before the JVA, the math may be a little bit off.

4092
05:04:06,139 --> 05:04:07,139
Look at this.

4093
05:04:07,139 --> 05:04:08,139
He's pulled it down the line.

4094
05:04:08,139 --> 05:04:09,139
It's fair.

4095
05:04:09,139 --> 05:04:10,139
Elbertson speeding past first.

4096
05:04:10,139 --> 05:04:11,139
He's thinking two.

4097
05:04:11,139 --> 05:04:12,139
Throw comes in the second.

4098
05:04:12,139 --> 05:04:19,139
Oh, he takes a quick turnaround and a good decision by crew chief Elbertson.

4099
05:04:19,139 --> 05:04:22,139
He rules himself safe at first.

4100
05:04:22,139 --> 05:04:25,139
And that one's in for the call strike.

4101
05:04:25,139 --> 05:04:26,139
Oh, two.

4102
05:04:26,139 --> 05:04:27,139
And oh my goodness.

4103
05:04:27,139 --> 05:04:28,139
Everyone clearing the.

4104
05:04:28,139 --> 05:04:29,139
Clearing the bench.

4105
05:04:29,139 --> 05:04:30,139
For the Magicians.

4106
05:04:30,139 --> 05:04:31,139
Oh my goodness.

4107
05:04:31,139 --> 05:04:32,139
This is bad.

4108
05:04:33,020 --> 05:04:34,020
Feed him to the lions.

4109
05:04:34,020 --> 05:04:35,580
Yeah.

4110
05:04:35,580 --> 05:04:36,580
Feed him.

4111
05:04:36,580 --> 05:04:37,580
Feed him to the lions.

4112
05:04:37,580 --> 05:04:38,580
Don't you think?

4113
05:04:38,580 --> 05:04:42,169
But you know, it's not Yahoo.

4114
05:04:42,169 --> 05:04:44,470
And what's not cool.

4115
05:04:44,470 --> 05:04:45,470
Drugs and alcohol.

4116
05:04:45,470 --> 05:04:46,470
For the organ, Steve.

4117
05:04:49,930 --> 05:04:50,930
Let's go.

4118
05:04:50,930 --> 05:04:53,000
You can see my dick.

4119
05:04:53,000 --> 05:04:54,000
You can see my dick.

4120
05:04:54,000 --> 05:04:55,000
If you want to see it.

4121
05:04:55,000 --> 05:05:07,810
Freeze it.

4122
05:05:07,810 --> 05:05:14,869
Yahoo.

4123
05:05:14,869 --> 05:05:15,869
I can't.

4124
05:05:22,139 --> 05:05:28,439
Oh, man.

4125
05:05:28,439 --> 05:05:35,119
You guys are unbelievably funny.

4126
05:05:35,119 --> 05:05:36,119
All right.

4127
05:05:36,119 --> 05:05:37,619
Let's get it.

4128
05:05:38,500 --> 05:05:40,500
The winner of best event of the year.

4129
05:05:40,500 --> 05:05:42,500
It's only about four or five of them.

4130
05:05:42,500 --> 05:05:43,500
So let's see.

4131
05:05:43,500 --> 05:05:44,500
It's going to be close.

4132
05:05:44,500 --> 05:05:46,099
It's not close.

4133
05:05:46,099 --> 05:05:48,340
It's not close at all.

4134
05:05:48,340 --> 05:05:53,779
Forty two point seven percent of the vote is the German Baseball Association.

4135
05:05:53,779 --> 05:06:00,479
And then the suss guy finally plays among us above who will replace me, which the suss

4136
05:06:00,479 --> 05:06:07,740
guy was twenty four point five percent and who will replace me at nineteen point four.

4137
05:06:08,380 --> 05:06:11,380
This was also the least skipped category of the year.

4138
05:06:11,380 --> 05:06:13,549
People wanted to vote for this.

4139
05:06:13,549 --> 05:06:15,549
And that's it.

4140
05:06:15,549 --> 05:06:18,860
So I am going to say good night.

4141
05:06:18,860 --> 05:06:20,860
Thanks, everybody, for watching.

4142
05:06:20,860 --> 05:06:22,860
It's been an unbelievable experience.

4143
05:06:22,860 --> 05:06:25,860
Before we go, before we go, I got to thank a lot of people.

4144
05:06:25,860 --> 05:06:27,860
But let's go ahead.

4145
05:06:27,860 --> 05:06:30,860
You know, we got them here and they're incredibly talented.

4146

We're not going to just not do this.

4149
05:06:39,419 --> 05:06:42,419
A lot of time and a lot of work and a lot of energy went into this.

4150
05:06:42,419 --> 05:06:43,419
I know people didn't expect.

4151
05:06:43,419 --> 05:06:45,419
Oh, well, you didn't do your award show.

4152
05:06:45,419 --> 05:06:46,419
Whatever.

4153
05:06:46,419 --> 05:06:47,419

4156
05:06:49,419 --> 05:06:52,419
