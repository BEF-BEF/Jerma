1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:34,340
Hey, I'm gonna do a wheelie. I'm just gonna let you laugh. Hey, Jerma. Start game. Private slots max. Jerma! Jerma! Jerma!

2
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:48,280
What? Invite me. I haven't made the game yet. The hemogloba chopper is down here. Wow, I haven't played this game forever.

3
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:55,560
We definitely should not be running to this, by the way, because it's gonna take us ages. I just gotta get to Hibachapa.

4
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,560
Hey, I dare you to turn around. I dare you to turn around and shoot Spoon with that shotgun.

5
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:12,909
Hey! Hey! No! No! No! You flipped on my screen and just stood back up. Yeah, me too.

6
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:21,030
I love you. Shoot Jerma. No, don't shoot me. Shoot Jerma. Shoot him in the back of the face. No! No! Don't!

7
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:27,829
He told me to! Yeah! What is this guy? Oh my god, that's a chopper.

8
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:38,159
Dude, there was like a freaking hole and I gotta look at this guy. This guy was in like winter clothing. Maybe it's winter.

9
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,659
No, it's like nice out right now. This guy is in a full winter hat. That just whizzed by my screen.

10
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:51,760
Alright, the game is on. No, I'm sorry, I hit the helicopter. Do you think you can get me in this car?

11
00:01:51,760 --> 00:02:01,019
Don't run me over. Oh no! I think I can get you, yeah. I didn't mean to do that. I'm so sorry, Spoon.

12
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:06,840
Wait, you want to run in the car and I chase you down onto Helichoop? Yeah, let's see if you can get me.

13
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,840
Here, you can start going. Alright, I'm gonna go this way. Here we go.

14
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,539
Oh god! Oh, you have it? Yeah, I got a chopper. You gotta get in the car and you gotta escape the chopper.

15
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:31,539
Alright, we're in one in the airfield. You're never gonna get me because it's the best car in the game.

16
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:37,539
Okay. I'll get in my own car. You're probably not gonna find one. I'm gonna find one.

17
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:42,539
Just wait until I play the music in my head of me like chasing you down.

18
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:50,539
How am I gonna hear it in your head, Jerma? I found a bike. Don't worry, I got this. Don't run me over.

19
00:02:50,539 --> 00:03:01,509
I'll sell another fit. Oh jeez. I didn't hear the music. Oh man, this is weird.

20
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:07,509
Are you in the chopper right now? Yes. Oh jeez. Oh jeez.

21
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:11,509
It's pretty weird to be in the chopper.

22
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:14,509
He's going to crash without us even being there.

23
00:03:14,509 --> 00:03:17,509
Where are you? I'll do it.

24
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:21,509
How high are you? Why are you that high in the air? I don't know, what do I do?

25
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:27,509
Hold S, hold S. Hold S, S. No, no, don't hold it down.

26
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:33,509
Wow. I'm never listening to you again. I didn't mean to like hold S until you die.

27
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:38,509
You still hold S. Yeah, but that means that's like how to like descend.

28
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:45,759
Not like just hold until I die. I'm ready for you to go.

29
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:52,120
Here comes the chase scene.

30
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,120
Why are you faster than me? This is not cool.

31
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,550
I'm going to get you.

32
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:03,319
How are you faster than a helicopter going, listen to this plane.

33
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,319
I was looking the other way.

34
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,319
Am I still alive? I'm still alive.

35
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:12,319
Here, I'll give you a ride back to the helicopters. Thanks.

36
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,319
Get in. Or not.

37
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:22,000
We're so bad at this. Every time we try to organize something and do something special.

38
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm going to get the helicopter and you guys just go anywhere and I'll chase you for the rest of the time we're playing and you will die.

39
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,829
Spoon, why are you on fire? Because I'm just cool like that.

40
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:39,350
You want me to land on the ambulance? Yeah, try to land right on like the flat part of the ambulance.

41
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:50,220
We need to like hang out. Even if I have like a tea party on the top of the ambulance.

42
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,220
That was so lame.

43
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,220
That just looked like you jumped into bed.

44
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:02,220
This is a mattress and you just like jumped into bed like ah.

45
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,839
That was so anticlimactic.

46
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:08,170
Oh, no. Stop blocking me.

47
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,410
All right. You guys want to have like a sumo wrestling fight up here? Yeah, sure.

48
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,410
Whoever gets like knocked off the ambulance loses.

49
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:18,399
Spoon, you ready? Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

50
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:25,819
Get in, cousin.

51
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:28,189
Please don't take Gatling gun helicopter.

52
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:31,189
No, I didn't take the Gatling gun helicopter. You know what?

53
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:34,189
No, please. No, please. It's my favorite.

54
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:37,189
You ain't going to get shit.

55
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:41,000
Oh, good job, cousin.

56
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm not sure. Oh, shit.

57
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Wrong button.

58
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Don't ask me that. Don't.

59
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I don't understand how this makes any sense.

60
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's still there.

61
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,180
Why? Why is it still there?

62
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,180
I got to destroy it.

63
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,180
Why did you destroy mine?

64
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,180
I'm going to get it. Come on.

65
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,180
Yes.

66
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,180
I got it.

67
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,180
I am the victor.

68
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,800
All right, Spoon, I'm picking you up.

69
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,430
No way. I got a helicopter.

70
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,560
Is that? Oh, it's respawned.

71
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,560
It's respawned. It's respawned.

72
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,560
Operation, do not let him get it.

73
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,560
Destroy it.

74
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,560
I don't think you. I can't. I can't.

75
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,560
I'm missing.

76
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,560
I'm missing my line up here.

77
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,560
He said crash into him.

78
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,800
Yes.

79
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
He said crash into him.

80
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,800
I'm on his tail.

81
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,810
For Niko.

82
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:37,810
Come here.

83
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,240
We are seriously like birds fighting in the air.

84
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,110
I'm going to get you. It's going to happen.

85
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,110
No.

86
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,110
You son of a bitch.

87
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,120
I'm actually figuring out how to fly like this.

88
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,120
You can actually control it. Oh my God.

89
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
You got it?

90
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,120
I just have to wait for it to turn.

91
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,470
You are like a cheap

92
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,470
$10 RC helicopter

93
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,470
right now.

94
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,470
Look at what I got for Christmas today.

95
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,769
It's like if I hold

96
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:12,769
the trigger, when it turns

97
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:14,769
in the direction I want to go, it moves that way.

98
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:16,769
I can't believe you are still

99
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,769
flying this thing. This is unbelievable.

100
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:20,769
No, he's going to have my view.

101
00:07:20,769 --> 00:07:22,769
I'm trying to follow him.

102
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:25,649
Oh, that was not. That was a bad move.

103
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:30,560
What?

104
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,560
Get him. Die.

105
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,560
Get him. Die.

106
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,870
Did he crash? I had to reload.

107
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,870
He's reloading.

108
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,870
He's right here. He's right here. You got a chance.

109
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,110
Niko, come with me. I'm reloading.

110
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,139
Take cover.

111
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:49,139
You're down, final boss.

112
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:52,339
Get him.

113
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,339
Oh, geez. Oh, God.

114
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:56,339
Run.

115
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:58,769
Oh, no. I got hit by a cousin.

116
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,769
That was terrifying.

117
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:02,769
And I got out. I'm out. I'm fine.

118
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:05,910
Die.

119
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,910
Did you just jump out?

120
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,850
Why did you do that?

121
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,850
I thought I could land on

122
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,850
the building and be fine, but my dick slammed

123
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,850
into it and I kept falling.
