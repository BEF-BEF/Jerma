1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:12,710
How the heck are you? Hey, you sleeping? Hey, wake up. Hi guys.

2
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:19,829
Oops. Welcome to another stream. Just saw you last night potentially.

3
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:25,239
Or maybe I didn't. Maybe you weren't here yesterday.

4
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:37,320
And in that regard, how are you today? A loud streamer wakes up innocent viewers.

5
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,009
Innocent viewers. What about that one time you called me an idiot?

6
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:49,750
Guilty! Now I hope you guys are doing well. We're going to start today.

7
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:54,820
Sort of where we left off yesterday. And that is...

8
00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:05,989
I almost puked. What is going on? What's with this fucking like earthquake?

9
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:22,390
Like the choppers closing in? Listen to this. You good?

10
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:27,939
Okay, what is... Is everyone just hovering here?

11
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:31,909
That was a long time. That was almost a full

12
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:35,769
10 to 15 second straight. Longer than that.

13
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:39,849
But no, we're going to play Clock Tower 3. It is a classic PlayStation 2

14
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,390
game. I don't know how much of it I'm going to

15
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:49,319
play, but I'm going to give it at least a solid attempt. And then from there

16
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:55,900
we're going to move on to probably 25 to life.

17
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:02,280
I still need to find a place to play this game that requires 12 hours.

18
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,950
Maybe we'll do that today too. Should I start? No, I can't start with that

19
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:14,500
one. That game probably sucks ass. I thought Clock Tower 3 was the bad

20
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:20,840
one. Oh, I thought it was the good one. Did I

21
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:32,199
get the bad one? Is Clock Tower 3 the bad one?

22
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:41,509
Three is the bad one. So what's the good one?

23
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:47,400
Two is the bad one. Clock Tower 3 is the good one.

24
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,780
He doesn't know. One and two. Three is just weird.

25
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,580
It's not scary. Well, good thing I've got

26
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,219
a little bit of a list here to play today and tomorrow.

27
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:07,740
And then we're going to close the book on retro for a while.

28
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,060
I've said that like so many times. I have so many old games.

29
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,659
I keep saying, yeah, we've done like three streams in a row

30
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:21,259
of Dreamcast. Yeah, we're going to close the book a

31
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:24,300
little while and like the old retro stuff and then like a week and a

32
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,699
half later I'm playing PlayStation 2 again.

33
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:33,939
I was gonna say Dark Souls, but I don't know why that was going to

34
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:41,509
happen. It's not just the game that's old,

35
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:44,789
but I love it though. I love like playing these old games, especially the old

36
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:49,129
strange, obscure ones that just don't make any sense.

37
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:55,860
It scratches an itch in my brain, so I love it.

38
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,240
But we're going to go back to VR after tomorrow.

39
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,560
So if you're wondering, wait, when are you going to go back to that VR stuff?

40
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,169
I just needed a break from it. VR is going to come back next week.

41
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:10,550
We're going to do Mind Show and then I kind of want to go back to

42
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:17,879
Jet Island and keep playing that, but it

43
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:25,430
should be fun. That should be at some point in the

44
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:34,819
middle or late of next week. No one liked Jet Island? I did.

45
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:39,959
I did. What's your overall opinion on VR so far? I wish I could just play it

46
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:43,579
every day. We would be playing it. I'd be doing

47
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:49,290
it right now. I'd be streaming VR today and yesterday,

48
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:54,139
but I can't do it. My fucking old man brain can't do it.

49
00:04:54,139 --> 00:05:01,399
I just want to live in VR. All right, let's get going. I'm going to play

50
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:13,689
the good one. Incoming Clock Tower 3. Let's just have some fun. No, let's just

51
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:17,379
relax. You got to build up a tolerance to it.

52
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:22,980
Yeah, if I do that for more than three, four, five straight days,

53
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,970
two days in a row, three days in a row, if I wasn't even streaming it,

54
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,529
I would still have to take a break from it for a couple days. I would

55
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:39,350
start getting headaches. It's like wearing glasses for the first time.

56
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,790
This game includes disturbing content and scenes of graphic violence. Does

57
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,089
it? It's a PlayStation 2, though. It don't

58
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:48,889
count. The graphics aren't good enough for it to be, like, actually a

59
00:05:48,889 --> 00:06:05,620
problem. Produced by Capcom. Directed by...

60
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:59,850
I didn't see it. Not seeing. Quiet.

61
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,110
It is Mr. X.

62
00:07:10,920 --> 00:08:13,699
This is a Capcom game. Mr. X drops a nuke somewhere.

63
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:22,569
Clock Tower 3! All right, make sure we're right here.

64
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:27,209
Only type. I can't type and play the game at the same time.

65
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:35,350
That wouldn't make any sense. This is not the technical screen, too, although I

66
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:38,710
kind of wish it was sometimes. That was so much fun.

67
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:43,500
I'm just in the right spot. This is not correct.

68
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:59,830
Wow, hold on, hold on, hold on. It's pre-recorded. You can type.

69
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:05,019
This is not pre-recorded. I feel like I'm gonna get Phantom of

70
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:11,059
the Opera memed here. No, no, I need that back. Give me that

71
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:18,940
back so I can see what I'm doing. All right, that looks good. A little bit

72
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,990
of bars on the sides, but it's cinematic, okay? Well, get those

73
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,830
bars off. No, that makes it a 16 by 8.

74
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,309
That makes it 15 by 9. You guys, that's

75
00:09:30,309 --> 00:09:45,259
cinematic. Is this a movie? I don't know.

76
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:59,159
Dearest Alyssa, how have you been? I think of you every day.

77
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:03,159
It seems such a long time since you started your life at boarding school.

78
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:06,600
It was after your beloved grandfather went missing while traveling three

79
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,840
years ago that I sent you away to boarding

80
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,840
school and told you not to come back for at least six years

81
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,559
without giving you any explanation. It must have been very painful for you

82
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:21,159
and I'm sorry, but it was for your own protection.

83
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,559
Now your 15th birthday is approaching and I fear your life may be in danger

84
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:30,039
more than ever before. Please go into hiding until your 15th

85
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:33,659
birthday has passed. I know that what I am saying will make

86
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:37,659
no sense to you, but please do as I tell you and hide as

87
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:42,730
quickly as you can. Your loving mother, Nancy.

88
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:49,220
Mum. Alyssa, you're wanted on the telephone. It's your mother.

89
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:56,549
Hello? Mum? Hello? Are you there? Put on to me. Hello?

90
00:10:56,549 --> 00:11:25,590
Am I playing yet? Mum, I'm back. Margeants.

91
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:32,649
What? Are we already starting? All right, I should pay attention and not

92
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:36,889
write like fucking tongue-in-cheek scripts on my video

93
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:41,220
page. By the way, that was the, I think

94
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,320
that was the actual garage band default sound you can make for a

95
00:11:45,320 --> 00:12:01,769
jumpscare. Does Mr. X talk? Is he a tail?

96
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:07,860
Yes, I am. Oh, I'm Alyssa, Nancy's daughter.

97
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:13,059
Daughter? Do you know where my mother is? Your mother has gone out.

98
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:17,700
That was early yesterday morning. Huh? She mentioned that she would not be

99
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,179
coming back for some time. What? She was wrong. She won't be

100
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:24,980
coming back. At all. And he's gonna bring the

101
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:31,500
scissors up and start snapping at me. You are all in this world, little girl.

102
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:37,179
See? Here he comes. My sweet Alyssa. All right, I don't like this. I've been

103
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:40,379
waiting so long for this moment. Get away from me. I don't like this

104
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:43,740
version of Lemony Snickett's A Series of Unfortunate Events.

105
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:58,230
Is that supposed to be, uh, Snood? What's his name? Olaf.

106
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:04,409
Count Snood. All right, let's go. So I just...

107
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,690
What the fuck was that? My shadow. I thought the shadow was an alien.

108
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:13,720
What am I supposed to do? The light from the fire casts a reddish glow.

109
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:21,129
Okay. Play Snood or pre-record it. Snood is the original virus game.

110
00:13:21,129 --> 00:13:30,009
Don't you guys know? The clock keeps perfect time. And the

111
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,250
chair that strange gentleman was sitting in,

112
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:38,539
a terrible smell is emanating. His unwashed smelly body

113
00:13:38,539 --> 00:13:45,779
had been sitting there for at least three or four hours.

114
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:49,299
And you find it absolutely revolting that a smell could linger for that

115
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:57,850
long. Okay, so this was a save point. A diary

116
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,049
lies open with an incomplete entry. You can save game data here.

117
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:09,740
Sure. Bootleg smelly Mr. X.

118
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:26,840
Just leave and call the police. Something wrong? One minute and 20

119
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,200
seconds. Guest wing first floor. All right.

120
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,549
Yeah, I'm just gonna leave. There's no need to go out now. I have to

121
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:38,970
find Mum. All right, let's go find Mum. This

122
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,610
is bright. A strange pattern adorns the jar.

123
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:50,519
It is brimming with fresh water. Okay. Do I have any other menu? Okay, is

124
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,039
there a menu or something I can look at?

125
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:57,350
There's a map. So it looks like I can go

126
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:03,240
through. Okay, let's go there. Mr. X is just Sir Topham Hatt.

127
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:15,049
Go this way. Nothing of interest here. You don't want to open the door?

128
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:19,210
Do I hide in this game? I have to hide from Mr. X, right?

129
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:23,419
It's filled with art and antiques. Grandfather used to collect that kind of

130
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:31,000
thing. This is Capcom, so those of you saying

131
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,320
that this is a copy of Resident Evil, you mean you're probably right, but they

132
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:40,279
made the other one too. All guest rooms from this point forward.

133
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:43,779
Everyone's out. It's locked. All guest rooms from this

134
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:52,090
point forth. Everyone's out. Okay. Grandfather's room. He's not here now.

135
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:56,490
It's been three years since he left. When is he coming back?

136
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:02,570
Ooh, I don't know if he's gonna come back.

137
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:09,240
I don't know how to tell you that. He left.

138
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,019
He took off three years ago. No one decided to tell her.

139
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:22,620
All right, upstairs now. Let's check this one. Let me look at the map.

140
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,649
I need to have complete map knowledge. Where am I standing?

141
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:34,549
Right there. So we're gonna go into the corner here. All right, this one

142
00:16:34,549 --> 00:16:40,149
has a spell on it.

143
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:46,549
Okay, so it turns the lights off. That's a pretty weird place for a

144
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:53,529
light switch. The panic meter. Whenever Alyssa is

145
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:57,929
feeling physically or emotionally threatened, the panic meter rises.

146
00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:02,090
When the panic meter reaches max, Alyssa falls into a state of panic.

147
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,769
While in a state of panic, Alyssa's movements are restricted

148
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:09,289
and if attacked while in a state of panic, she will die.

149
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:13,130
The panic meter reading will go down slowly if Alyssa

150
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,289
relaxes in a safe place. Always keep an eye on the panic meter

151
00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:20,980
and try to minimize stress whenever possible.

152
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,779
All right, so we have to manage a panic meter.

153
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:29,539
Or you could call it the P meter. For short, we could

154
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:36,619
simplify that as the Peter. Sounds good.

155
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:51,660
So don't touch that. First jump scare of the game. Fire!

156
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:57,619
That's really bad. You found it, Django.

157
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:04,579
All right, let's see what it is. The wall behind the fireplace is falling apart.

158
00:18:04,579 --> 00:18:08,440
Who would have thought there was a hidden room in there? We'll get in

159
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:15,430
there. Oh well, circle is crouch apparently.

160
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:23,289
Do I get any weapons or anything? No, the whole point of clock tower is you're

161
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:33,400
just walking. Okay, grandpa had a weird graphic imagery. That's graphic.

162
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:44,519
See? What's that? Let me see. That looks like a bottle and a letter down

163
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:51,609
there. It's a bottle of sacred bottle

164
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:56,549
and a letter. Let's read the letter in a good accent here.

165
00:18:56,549 --> 00:19:00,940
Nancy's letter. No, I'm not going to do that again.

166
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,859
Dearest Alyssa, I wanted nothing more than for you to live

167
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:09,400
peacefully, but if you are reading this now you must have come back to the

168
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,460
house. For your protection, I am giving you

169
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,180
some advice, as well as instructions on how to use

170
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:20,019
this bottle of holy water. How to use it. If you ever are

171
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:23,779
threatened, sprinkle some holy water on your asylum. It will cause them to

172
00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:28,339
halt temporarily. And to break the soup. No, I'm gonna,

173
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:31,539
I have to fucking take this knowledge in because I'm gonna read. People get

174
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:35,859
mad when I play games like this and I act like a dickhead and I don't

175
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:39,140
pay attention to what this says. Because right now I'm not paying any

176
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:43,799
attention at all to what this says. I'm just reading it. Here we go.

177
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:48,039
Exorcism. If you ever are threatened, sprinkles, if you ever are threatened,

178
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:51,720
sprinkle some holy water on your assailant. It will cause them to halt

179
00:19:51,720 --> 00:20:00,059
temporarily. So splash holy water like that.

180
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:05,099
Okay. Destroying sigils. To break the seals that prevent access to certain

181
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:10,039
places, sprinkle holy water on them. So those

182
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:13,160
seals, I sprinkle holy water. I'm paying attention.

183
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:21,880
I'm paying attention. See? So sprinkle, sprinkle.

184
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,119
Replenishing holy water. Always remember that the holy water you

185
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:30,119
have is not in limitless supply. You can refill your bottle from either

186
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:34,839
sacred jars or from lion drinking fountains.

187
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:39,400
Sacred jars or lion drinking fountains. So the jars, the jar.

188
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:47,160
Okay, my mouth. I gotta like, yeah, so those jars.

189
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,599
Sentimental items and spirits. A person who has died of unnatural causes

190
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:53,160
has unfinished business in the living world.

191
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,839
In order to protect yourself, you must work to heal their wounds. To do

192
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:04,259
so, you must find their sentimental item. Lastly, this is all my fault,

193
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:07,700
but I will do my best to protect you. Please remember that I love you more

194
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:13,099
than anything else in the world and I always will. So I have to find

195
00:21:13,099 --> 00:21:16,220
sentimental items to let the spirits go free.

196
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,220
Replenish the holy water from jars and drinking fountains.

197
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,299
Sigils can be destroyed with the holy water sprinkle

198
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:28,700
and the bad guy that chases you in the game can be temporarily stopped

199
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:34,579
with the sprinkle of the holy water. I'm reading. See?

200
00:21:34,579 --> 00:21:38,359
I'm trying. I'm turning over a new leaf in 2019.

201
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:42,200
It's paying attention to tutorial messages and really focusing.

202
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:48,220
I'm not gonna do any buff accents. It's the

203
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:53,210
patron saint of the Hamilton house. I can't even do it now.

204
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:58,420
What is it doing in here though? But the like the fucking dumb shit comedy

205
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,380
part of my brain is just fighting me inside my head right. There's a battle

206
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:06,970
going on. I'm gonna save the game. All right,

207
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:11,289
so I got the bottle of holy water. Is it mapped already? How do I use it?

208
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:15,589
Three? So I have three uses of it. How do I use it though?

209
00:22:15,589 --> 00:22:26,549
How do I stand up? Circle? Let me go to the controls first.

210
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:33,210
Items, files, key items, options. Let's just look.

211
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:36,650
This is back when games didn't have tutorials. The tutorial for games back

212
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:41,130
like 20 years ago, they had instructional booklets that

213
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:44,490
you read before you put the disk in. All right, search is

214
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:50,650
x, duck is circle, walk is square, attack is triangle. That's very

215
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:53,529
important. No vibration because it'll just ruin

216
00:22:53,529 --> 00:23:04,230
everything. Look, it always does. Special arrow is r1. Well, it's triangle.

217
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:07,190
You read the booklets on the way back from the game story. Yeah, don't you

218
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:10,140
guys wish that it was like that still?

219
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,059
They should have a timer when you download a video game. This should be

220
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,220
you open it up and there's a 30 minute timer

221
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:20,700
and it gives you a little book to read about how the game works.

222
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,859
And the game doesn't physically unlock until 30 minutes after you open it.

223
00:23:24,859 --> 00:23:35,099
All right, so I can open this now with the holy water.

224
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:45,559
So let's try it. Did it work? Yep. I need to save the game. Is there

225
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:50,759
is there a safe point going to be in here?

226
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:53,799
Let's just go save it because I know this is one of those games where

227
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:59,880
I have to save it constantly. There's gonna be monsters, there's

228
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:06,900
gonna be aliens and shit. Save the game after all that hard

229
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:15,259
work. The game looks cool. Yeah, I thought you guys said this was

230
00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:20,579
the bad one. I did my research. I did my research on

231
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:23,779
which one was the best one, aka which one was the cheapest and

232
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:33,829
currently available for me to buy. I did a lot of research on it. I have

233
00:24:33,829 --> 00:24:36,470
a question though. If I refill this here, does it get

234
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,630
rid of this? Should I not refill this till I have

235
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:44,619
zero? He didn't read the manual for 30 minutes.

236
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:52,700
The cheapest one. I'm just kidding. This wasn't the cheapest one. I did

237
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:57,190
save. Refill the holy water. Yeah, I did just

238
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:00,859
save it. Let's see if it disappears. No, okay good. So I can refill it

239
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:07,349
whenever I want there. Who reads anymore? Now that's the

240
00:25:07,349 --> 00:25:12,380
problem with this generation is nobody's reading books anymore.

241
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,539
You know what I'm saying? Like, that's a problem. People aren't reading anymore.

242
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:29,640
You should be reading a book a week. It's actually

243
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,079
it's offensive to me that people are not reading at least one to two books

244
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,920
a week. All right, can I get rid of this one?

245
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:54,380
I just got a sigil on it. Name one book you've read this year.

246
00:25:54,380 --> 00:26:00,890
It's 2019. Look, this is what I do.

247
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:07,000
So yeah, we have to read one book per week, right, is what I just said.

248
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,599
That's fine. What I do is I wait till the end of the year

249
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:14,200
and then the last like six weeks of the year I read a book every day.

250
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,720
So it still counts. This is Nancy's room.

251
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:28,730
Well, hold on, that's not, wait a minute. I did read how to

252
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:32,630
reinstall the filter in my air purifier. That was

253
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:35,509
actually really long. It was probably like 15 pages

254
00:26:35,509 --> 00:26:38,470
of how to like do maintenance and care on my humidifier.

255
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:51,430
Is that me moment up? Archie comics don't count as a book. Yes they do.

256
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:55,460
I read all of the Attack on Titan manga.

257
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:04,519
I'll prove it to you. You gotta read it right to left. Huh?

258
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:17,259
I told you that I did that. I know you told me not to but I couldn't

259
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:25,750
help it. I'm so worried about you. Where are you?

260
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:33,769
Those pillows suck. Those are pillows you'd find as a

261
00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:37,769
throw pillow on a dirty couch. That's what you sleep on?

262
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:47,940
Is that Mum? Did he replace himself in all the family photos?

263
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:56,789
Who's playing the piano? Who's playing that?

264
00:27:56,789 --> 00:28:03,349
Where's the sound coming from? Who's doing that?

265
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:07,180
You should have stabbed the photo. You had an opportunity. This is the way to

266
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,740
kill him. This is his heart right here and you had a chance and that's what

267
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,259
we're gonna find out at the very end of the game.

268
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:15,720
You could have just stabbed the book and blood will come out of that book

269
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:30,490
and you kill him. More shit like that in movies. I'm so

270
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:33,210
sick of like the doll that comes to life.

271
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:37,049
I'm so sick of like that we got lost in the woods. No no no. Where's

272
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:40,730
the book that is the heart or that is the

273
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:43,369
monster? And the book is just a spell book.

274
00:28:43,369 --> 00:28:47,059
It's like Merlin's fucking tomb. You know what I mean?

275
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:50,420
And the family is so terrified of all this shit going on in the house.

276
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,460
It could be werewolves. They could be fucking Loch Ness monsters. It could be

277
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,180
aliens like crashing down into the house and like killing people and eating

278
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,500
people. But it's the book that's doing it. It's

279
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,380
the Merlin's fucking magic tomb that's on their bookshelf and they

280
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,380
didn't even realize it and they flip through at the end of the movie

281
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,420
and it's every page is all the fucked up shit that's been going on

282
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,720
in the house. And they fucking stab through the book and like the book

283
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:16,420
bleeds and that's the end of the movie.

284
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:23,880
Door's sealed. That's literally happened. That happened in Goosebumps.

285
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:31,930
Well make it. Okay was that just a Goosebumps book?

286
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:50,309
For that? These mo-capped explosion jumps.

287
00:29:50,309 --> 00:29:53,750
Actor in a studio with like a bunch of wires off.

288
00:29:53,750 --> 00:30:13,349
This is way too expensive for us to not know what the hell's happening.

289
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:17,940
She's desperately trying to find the piano. Each key on the piano is a

290
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,140
different monster on it and like he's... I'm sorry never mind.

291
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:38,539
So where am I supposed to go? I thought this was Clock Tower 3.

292
00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:42,869
This dude's flying in flight in a bumblebee.

293
00:30:42,869 --> 00:30:48,490
Something's holding the door. What's it gonna be? A monster in here?

294
00:30:52,490 --> 00:31:17,000
Elsa. Uh-oh. Monster sequence. I'm ready. Oh shit.

295
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:29,289
Oh shit. That was a great reaction. The ring. Give me back my ring.

296
00:31:29,609 --> 00:31:34,579
Here comes the piano. Can I get the ring? Ring. What about it? Is it in here?

297
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:41,190
Okay. Engagement ring. I got a ring.

298
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:49,690
Spiritual healing. When you find a sentimental item

299
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:53,049
that belongs to a person who died of unnatural causes, return it to its

300
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:57,529
rightful owner. If it is a ring, put it in its case. If it's a half heart pendant,

301
00:31:57,529 --> 00:32:00,490
put it together with the other half by returning the sentimental item. Spirits are

302
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:04,890
healed and Elissa may obtain another item or value the information in return.

303
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,650
When you find a sentimental...

304
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:11,930
Some people are getting probably very angry at this.

305
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:15,539
Let me just like swirl around my fucking whiskey.

306
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:23,640
When you find a sentimental item that belongs to a person who died of

307
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:32,700
unnatural causes, return it to its rightful owner. If it's a ring, put it in its case.

308
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:37,180
If it is a half heart pendant, put it together with the other half.

309
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:41,799
By returning these sentimental items, spirits are healed

310
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:45,880
and Elissa may obtain another item or valuable information in return.

311
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,960
Put the ring in the box. Put the pendant together.

312
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:58,410
You got it. The box is literally right here.

313
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:06,859
How do I put the ring in the box? I kind of have to get you a...

314
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:11,980
Should I throw holy water at this lady? Put the ring in the box.

315
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:16,440
An empty ring box. Did someone steal the ring from him?

316
00:33:21,819 --> 00:33:25,819
Do I actually have to select it?

317
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:40,150
What's inventory? Does it start? Okay, do I actually have to use it?

318
00:33:40,869 --> 00:33:41,750
Drop it. Okay.

319
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:51,420
Yeah, I know what you're gonna do. Use item, yes.

320
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:58,940
My ring! You found my ring! Thank you.

321
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:07,769
Here, I left you some humanity. Thanks, hacker.

322
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:18,630
Sigil stone. Sigil stone. Let's get some info on that.

323
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:23,590
We'll take an attack on your behalf once.

324
00:34:24,789 --> 00:34:27,800
So it's just... it's just a shield.

325
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:33,510
So it's an armor. It's one armor.

326
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:37,820
Oh, I can refill this. Good thing I paid attention.

327
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:45,909
Uh, it's a very fun... You can save and refill. That's cool.

328
00:34:47,190 --> 00:35:02,550
How the hell do you do that on a piano?

329
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:08,760
How could you be that fast? Listen to this guy.

330
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:16,739
How the fuck can you even do that shit?

331
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:25,480
If you don't play the piano, well...

332
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,920
Seriously, that's... that's a skill. That's an incredible skill.

333
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:48,300
Congress? What's that? I can hear a piano. Is it coming from Congress?

334
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:58,710
Jerma, do the invisible guitar joke. Ha ha ha.

335
00:36:02,389 --> 00:36:05,269
He starts... he starts and stops playing.

336
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:06,949
It's almost like he forgets how to play the song

337
00:36:06,949 --> 00:36:09,750
and then he just goes completely wild and knows exactly...

338
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,980
See? Wait, is it this key? Yeah, I know, I got it again.

339
00:36:29,429 --> 00:36:33,269
Stop playing this game to force another joke?

340
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:36,389
Wait, you want me to like put another PlayStation game in?

341
00:36:36,389 --> 00:36:37,590
No, I want to play this game.

342
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:51,900
What? You want me to like... you want to put in like a...

343
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:57,190
You want to put in like fucking Stuntman and then reach for content?

344
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,880
What's wrong with this?

345
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:17,380
No, we're doing this for a little while. I'm playing this for a while.

346
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:28,460
All right, I gotta find a ring.

347
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:36,440
You're constantly stopping to make jokes.

348
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,800
Do you know what stream you're on?

349
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,099
I'm pretty sure that's what we do every time we play a game.

350
00:37:45,820 --> 00:38:00,199
All right, I guess I got a pen. Is this this lady's pen?

351
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:03,099
Looks like you shoved it up your ass.

352
00:38:03,099 --> 00:38:16,630
I thought this guy was a serious gamer.

353
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:20,869
All right, but that's not a... just a gold fountain pen.

354
00:38:20,869 --> 00:38:30,840
Okay, it's covered in blood stains of victim's belongings.

355
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:34,280
The entry begins, my darling must be addressed to her fiance.

356
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,960
Did you pen come out of here?

357
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:50,730
All right, return pen.

358
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,210
That means I get one of those shards, right?

359
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,329
Invisibility band.

360
00:38:55,449 --> 00:38:57,369
All right, this game's starting to get really, really bad.

361
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:00,579
It's like not fun.

362
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:02,900
And I should go force a joke on another game.

363
00:39:03,619 --> 00:39:06,019
Ring worn for temporary invisibility.

364
00:39:06,739 --> 00:39:12,900
No, I'm just kidding. I fucking think this is fun.

365
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,500
Hey, you can just relax.

366
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:22,550
What else is over here?

367
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:30,820
Do another Scottish accent.

368
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:37,190
No, what is with you guys lately?

369
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,269
This is like the guy yesterday that said,

370
00:39:39,269 --> 00:39:41,670
all right, you can't take a break for a day

371
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,670
and then come back and play Ed, Ed and Eddie.

372
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:50,090
You have to dare you take a day off

373
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:51,449
and then play Ed, Ed and Eddie.

374
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:00,599
He was right.

375
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,690
All right, I made it into a new house.

376
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:18,619
Lavender water, what's the difference?

377
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:28,780
Cordial distilled from beautiful purple flower alleviates panic.

378
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:32,900
Okay, make some smell nice.

379
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:37,460
There's gonna be something in here scary.

380
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,820
This is a letter from dad.

381
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,699
Here comes a joke.

382
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:53,699
How are you?

383
00:40:53,699 --> 00:40:56,820
I'm now in France in a region known as Champagne.

384
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:02,019
Ooh, that is a beautiful place with vineyards as far as the eye can see.

385
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,940
When the war is over, we must come here together for a holiday.

386
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:10,260
I hear that they have organized for blackouts in London now.

387
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:15,380
I'm sure that you are fine during the day as Jane is there.

388
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:18,659
But I worry about your being alone at night.

389
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,219
You'll be all right, won't you, darling?

390
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,159
Keep warm.

391
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:25,239
With love, Orson.

392
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,989
Did I miss something?

393
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:41,500
No, that was a classic reference.

394
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,300
Classic joke.

395
00:41:43,929 --> 00:41:45,289
That's a huge telephone.

396
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,690
It's way too big for anybody to hold.

397
00:41:48,409 --> 00:41:50,730
All right, that's just you because you're a short streamer.

398
00:41:51,289 --> 00:42:06,980
Good evening, sir.

399
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,260
This is my first stream.

400
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,780
I want serious gameplay.

401
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,550
I'm sorry that you probably won't get that here.

402
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:25,320
Bring back Orson.

403
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,519
Bring back Orson.

404
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:28,039
Bring back Orson.

405
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:33,960
The desk is clean and well organized.

406
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:39,019
That just depends on who's got control of the controller today.

407
00:42:39,019 --> 00:42:39,579
You know what I mean?

408
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:43,130
Some days, you get me.

409
00:42:43,849 --> 00:42:45,929
Other days, you get a guy that beats Jebel first try.

410
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,880
I don't know who you're going to be talking to.

411
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:54,840
Remember that movie with Professor X, the young Professor X?

412
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,639
It's kind of like that.

413
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,579
Whatever his name is.

414
00:42:57,579 --> 00:43:00,739
This must be the owner of the house.

415
00:43:00,739 --> 00:43:01,300
There's a key.

416
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,500
There's a key next to it.

417
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,059
Yes, there is.

418
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,659
Red draw key.

419
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,719
There's probably a red draw in this building.

420
00:43:25,179 --> 00:43:25,739
Fireplace.

421
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:29,179
The poker is still stuck in the pile of firewood.

422
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:30,539
Somebody must have just been here.

423
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:35,980
These records look quite old.

424
00:43:39,739 --> 00:43:43,690
I wonder how many people screamed at that one.

425
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:48,840
That wouldn't even go.

426
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,800
That was just a rat.

427
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:51,960
There's some mouse in here.

428
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:52,519
Or a snake.

429
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:53,239
It could be a snake.

430
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:57,590
More than enough books on the classics here.

431
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:58,710
We've got Jermacraft.

432
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:01,030
We've got Otto's Big Adventure.

433
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:03,210
We've got Orson Welles.

434
00:44:04,699 --> 00:44:05,900
Oh, the classics in there.

435
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:11,369
I want more water though.

436
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,380
Rat movie.

437
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,769
I'm looking for a red draw.

438
00:44:19,769 --> 00:44:21,190
Is the one down here?

439
00:44:27,579 --> 00:44:27,820
No.

440
00:44:31,429 --> 00:44:33,030
Why am I so interested in this game?

441
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:33,750
I just am.

442
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:38,889
Lock from the other side.

443
00:44:38,889 --> 00:44:39,130
Shit.

444
00:44:39,849 --> 00:44:41,590
On the other side, the key's not going to work.

445
00:44:49,449 --> 00:44:50,650
Will it just use it automatically?

446
00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:52,250
No, it's for a draw.

447
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:58,090
Have you ever played any good games?

448
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:00,010
I played super hot VR like three days ago.

449
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:02,070
It was great.

450
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:03,739
Beat it on stream too.

451
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,699
That's a really slow inventory.

452
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:12,519
Red draw.

453
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:13,639
Red draw.

454
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:14,199
Do we go in here?

455
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:24,809
He said good.

456
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:27,289
Is that a red draw?

457
00:45:27,289 --> 00:45:28,170
The desk is clean.

458
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,289
No, we were already in here.

459
00:45:29,289 --> 00:45:30,489
There's no red draw.

460
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:32,329
Red draw.

461
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:33,530
Okay, now you dropped it again.

462
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:34,889
Like you were going to get me again somehow.

463
00:45:37,269 --> 00:45:38,230
Let me look at the map.

464
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:40,489
Is this some...

465
00:45:40,489 --> 00:45:41,449
Okay, I haven't been over here.

466
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:44,809
What do you mean?

467
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:45,769
What am I saying wrong?

468
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:54,940
Unimaginative ghost puts jumpscare back in same place.

469
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:00,840
That is pretty funny.

470
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,630
This way, okay.

471
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:06,570
Red draw.

472
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:09,420
Blood.

473
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:10,889
There's blood everywhere.

474
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:12,340
It's locked.

475
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,059
I'm gonna let it open.

476
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:19,960
I only have one.

477
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:22,599
There it is.

478
00:46:25,289 --> 00:46:25,929
Drawer.

479
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:30,199
Yeah, but you gotta remember,

480
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:32,840
I have the remnants of a Boston accent.

481
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:41,219
I still say like car, car, car, draw, drawer.

482
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:44,440
What are you guys on about?

483
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,320
Christmas tragedy.

484
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,920
Young pianist brutally murdered.

485
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,889
Christmas day.

486
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:53,610
Mae Norton was found murdered in Norton's The Taylor.

487
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:58,380
She was discovered by Norton family member Jane Stride.

488
00:46:59,179 --> 00:47:01,989
Returned home to find the victim unconscious.

489
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:05,909
An autopsy revealed that it was an instantaneous death

490
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:08,230
caused by a blow to the skull with a heavy blunt object.

491
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:09,349
No suspects have been named.

492
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:14,230
The victim had taken part in the 15th Annual Piano Concord

493
00:47:14,949 --> 00:47:17,670
at the Victoria Hall in Kensington the previous day.

494
00:47:18,309 --> 00:47:20,949
A consummate pianist, Miss Norton,

495
00:47:20,949 --> 00:47:22,710
was widely tipped for first prize.

496
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,110
But an unfortunate error in her performance

497
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,710
prevented her from taking the crown.

498
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:29,750
May have been living at home alone since her father,

499
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:30,949
William Norton, serving officer,

500
00:47:30,949 --> 00:47:33,030
returned to the front in July.

501
00:47:34,469 --> 00:47:34,710
Okay.

502
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:40,889
It's pianist.

503
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,840
Something going on upstairs.

504
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,849
What the hell is going on up here?

505
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:54,570
What?

506
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:56,090
Where was this happening?

507
00:47:58,820 --> 00:47:59,300
What?

508
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,900
Why did I miss this upstairs?

509
00:48:03,139 --> 00:48:04,019
What the fuck?

510
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:16,280
Oh my fucking god.

511
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,320
That's insanity.

512
00:48:19,719 --> 00:48:20,760
Are you serious?

513
00:48:24,219 --> 00:48:25,579
I don't have a save point.

514
00:48:25,579 --> 00:48:26,219
What do I have to do?

515
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,119
Evade points and hide points.

516
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:35,030
When Alyssa is fleeing from an enemy,

517
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:37,510
certain predetermined areas may start to glow.

518
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:39,909
These are evade points and hide points.

519
00:48:40,869 --> 00:48:42,630
Approach the area and press the search button

520
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:44,389
to make Alyssa take evasive action

521
00:48:44,389 --> 00:48:45,829
and repel her attacker.

522
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:49,429
Most evade points can only be used once.

523
00:48:53,929 --> 00:48:56,170
Press the search button when in front of a hide point

524
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:57,690
and Alyssa can take refuge there.

525
00:48:58,409 --> 00:49:00,489
The camera will switch to a first-person view

526
00:49:00,489 --> 00:49:01,210
while in hiding.

527
00:49:02,889 --> 00:49:05,769
Hide points can usually be used repeatedly.

528
00:49:05,769 --> 00:49:08,010
But if the panic meter reaches max while in hiding,

529
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:10,250
Alyssa will run out from her hiding place.

530
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:12,809
Always keep an eye on the panic meter.

531
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:15,449
Because evade points and hide points,

532
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:18,329
and they glow and you have to hit X on them.

533
00:49:18,329 --> 00:49:18,809
Well, let's go.

534
00:49:18,809 --> 00:49:19,210
Whatever.

535
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:19,449
Hold on.

536
00:49:19,449 --> 00:49:22,489
First of all, let's open this first.

537
00:49:22,489 --> 00:49:23,210
There's something in here.

538
00:49:24,409 --> 00:49:27,159
It is Maze Room Key.

539
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:32,409
Man.

540
00:49:38,329 --> 00:49:38,570
What?

541
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:40,170
I can't open this.

542
00:49:41,929 --> 00:49:43,639
He's seeing off my name?

543
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:47,530
Can I get some evade points?

544
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:49,510
Oh!

545
00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:00,389
It's too slow.

546
00:50:00,389 --> 00:50:01,269
It's happening too slow.

547
00:50:01,269 --> 00:50:01,750
Where does he go?

548
00:50:02,469 --> 00:50:03,590
I have Maze Key.

549
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:04,949
I have Maze Room Key.

550
00:50:04,949 --> 00:50:10,099
What are you doing?

551
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:16,179
Hide?

552
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:17,699
I can't get in there?

553
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:19,639
How can I not get in there?

554
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,960
Maybe I can scare you now.

555
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:25,099
Fire poker.

556
00:50:25,099 --> 00:50:25,900
Fire poker in the head.

557
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:36,170
Sorry, ghost.

558
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:37,849
There's something way scarier here.

559
00:50:37,849 --> 00:50:38,329
What do I do?

560
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:39,769
I gotta get out of here now.

561
00:50:39,769 --> 00:50:40,329
How do I get out?

562
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:44,250
Anything else I can do?

563
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,369
He's gonna get up, right?

564
00:50:45,369 --> 00:50:46,329
These records look old.

565
00:50:46,329 --> 00:50:46,650
No, no, no.

566
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:47,690
Get out of the room.

567
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:48,650
Can I do anything else?

568
00:50:49,449 --> 00:50:53,349
Go, go, go.

569
00:50:53,349 --> 00:50:53,909
Out, out, out.

570
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,800
Smash his head with a hammer.

571
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,360
That's what I would do.

572
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:02,619
If that was me,

573
00:51:02,619 --> 00:51:04,619
I would smash that guy's head with a sludge hammer.

574
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,179
Like a watermelon.

575
00:51:09,449 --> 00:51:10,329
And then I would just like,

576
00:51:10,329 --> 00:51:11,690
I would burn him.

577
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:13,130
I would drag him to the fire.

578
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:18,699
Where's this?

579
00:51:18,699 --> 00:51:19,820
And I would sit there and watch

580
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:20,860
and just make sure it was gone.

581
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:24,940
Psycho?

582
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:25,260
M?

583
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:25,820
Oh, really?

584
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,099
The guy chasing you with a sludge hammer

585
00:51:27,099 --> 00:51:28,780
that just killed like a little girl?

586
00:51:30,039 --> 00:51:30,599
Are you sure?

587
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:32,789
I'm the psycho?

588
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:36,539
The key to Maze Room on the second floor.

589
00:51:36,539 --> 00:51:37,659
I need to get up there.

590
00:51:37,659 --> 00:51:43,900
I can't just leave.

591
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:46,699
There's a locked door on the second floor.

592
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:52,389
I've seen every horror movie in the book.

593
00:51:56,090 --> 00:51:57,690
Okay, after that guy's burnt,

594
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:00,619
you put his ashes in a box

595
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:03,179
and like mail it to the fucking store,

596
00:52:03,179 --> 00:52:04,539
like North Pole or something.

597
00:52:09,909 --> 00:52:11,110
And then you pay a guy.

598
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:15,989
You pay a guy like 25 grand to eat the ashes.

599
00:52:15,989 --> 00:52:21,139
And you want like a private YouTube link

600
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:22,179
of the guy doing it.

601
00:52:22,179 --> 00:52:25,659
Just so you know.

602
00:52:26,699 --> 00:52:32,659
Because it's a diary.

603
00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:40,840
But then the guy that eats the ashes becomes the guy.

604
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,460
Today I darn daddy sucks and sewed a button on his shirt.

605
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:57,739
He calls himself a tailor,

606
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,260
but he can't even mend his own clothes.

607
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:00,460
Please dad, I'm not your wife.

608
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:03,579
A few more days until the button

609
00:53:03,579 --> 00:53:05,019
I still can't play perfectly.

610
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:05,579
What am I gonna do?

611
00:53:07,099 --> 00:53:07,980
I thought this was a game

612
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,219
where a guy in a tower chases you with scissors.

613
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:19,050
That's the first game.

614
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:21,849
Yeah, we played the first game for like 10 minutes.

615
00:53:21,849 --> 00:53:23,349
It was an invitation.

616
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:30,329
Uh oh.

617
00:53:30,329 --> 00:53:31,849
I told you we should have burnt him.

618
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:34,409
I told you we should have smashed his head

619
00:53:34,409 --> 00:53:36,409
like an egg and burnt his body.

620
00:53:36,409 --> 00:53:40,460
What did I tell you?

621
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:44,309
Hit him with a chair in the head.

622
00:53:44,949 --> 00:53:45,510
Oh my god.

623
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:51,420
What are you doing?

624
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:56,340
In the head.

625
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:04,380
Okay, this guy is really, really not that strong.

626
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:06,860
Like that was pretty big.

627
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:07,659
Come on man, really.

628
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:22,869
That was bad.

629
00:54:22,869 --> 00:54:25,429
He did a really cool Star Wars block the bullet.

630
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:27,429
He hit the chair with a sledgehammer.

631
00:54:27,429 --> 00:54:32,860
But then that's like getting one of those in a game

632
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:34,139
where you're doing really well

633
00:54:34,139 --> 00:54:35,500
and you do something fucking awesome.

634
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:39,909
Like you headshot a guy from across the whole map

635
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:42,630
in Apex Legends, right?

636
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:44,309
So you're playing Apex Legends

637
00:54:44,309 --> 00:54:46,389
and you're across the map and you snipe some guy

638
00:54:46,389 --> 00:54:49,110
and it's fucking like put it on the front page of every Reddit

639
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:52,230
and then you like fall off the cliff and die.

640
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:58,760
That's what happens.

641
00:54:58,760 --> 00:54:59,849
That's what that was.

642
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:07,510
All right, I need to get out of here.

643
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:08,550
Can I go?

644
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:12,579
All right, that's not even a sledgehammer.

645
00:55:12,579 --> 00:55:13,460
That's a broom.

646
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,639
This guy sucks.

647
00:55:18,739 --> 00:55:20,179
Hi, idiot.

648
00:55:20,179 --> 00:55:26,469
Use holy water on him?

649
00:55:26,469 --> 00:55:27,880
That's not a bad idea.

650
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:30,730
No, it's just a guy.

651
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:32,329
This is just a weird guy.

652
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:41,510
All right, I have the invitation to the piano hall.

653
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:44,460
I need to save the game.

654
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:51,159
Where's there a save point around here?

655
00:55:51,159 --> 00:55:52,119
Somewhere outside maybe?

656
00:55:52,679 --> 00:55:54,820
Is there no save point in this house?

657
00:56:11,099 --> 00:56:11,340
What?

658
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:16,139
He's serious.

659
00:56:17,019 --> 00:56:18,460
I need to get down there.

660
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,900
Oh, dude, this is this is stuff.

661
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,139
This reminds me of Apex Legends.

662
00:56:24,139 --> 00:56:26,780
When you like when you shoot the guy from across the map

663
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:29,659
and then you squat up and you land somewhere

664
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:35,050
and then like some guy comes out of nowhere and like kills you.

665
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,219
I actually don't want to die here.

666
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:54,539
This guy sucks.

667
00:56:56,199 --> 00:56:58,039
He really isn't even scary.

668
00:56:58,039 --> 00:56:59,079
He just sucks.

669
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:02,440
Where am I?

670
00:57:04,579 --> 00:57:05,139
What?

671
00:57:05,139 --> 00:57:13,980
He teleported.

672
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,179
Why did he teleport away?

673
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,420
Oh, here comes the piano again.

674
00:57:18,619 --> 00:57:22,380
I can refill, right?

675
00:57:23,179 --> 00:57:25,300
I can't refill my water here?

676
00:57:31,269 --> 00:57:31,750
Dynamite?

677
00:57:32,869 --> 00:57:38,260
You're the one playing the piano.

678
00:57:47,659 --> 00:57:48,219
Lissa!

679
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:51,269
Lissa!

680
00:57:51,989 --> 00:57:53,829
That's how it reminds me of it.

681
00:57:53,829 --> 00:57:58,150
You know when you're fucking and having a fun time with your friends in Apex Legends

682
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:00,550
and somebody over the mic is just like talking shit

683
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:01,909
and they make a funny voice.

684
00:58:01,909 --> 00:58:02,630
It's so funny.

685
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:23,539
I'm gonna have to learn how to play the piano.

686
00:58:23,539 --> 00:58:24,019
Watch this.

687
00:58:24,579 --> 00:58:26,469
What's that?

688
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:27,429
Oh, a diary.

689
00:58:27,429 --> 00:58:27,989
Save the game.

690
00:58:27,989 --> 00:58:28,230
Yep.

691
00:58:28,949 --> 00:58:34,659
What am I doing the next Apex Legends stream?

692
00:58:52,789 --> 00:58:53,429
Bunker S.

693
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:59,210
This is a stream sponsored by Respawn Legends.

694
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:00,250
Apex Entertainment.

695
00:59:00,889 --> 00:59:08,070
It looks fun.

696
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:08,389
It does.

697
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:12,219
It looks like a fun game.

698
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:18,469
I need some more holy water.

699
00:59:18,469 --> 00:59:21,190
It stopped.

700
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:23,429
Wait, is this it?

701
00:59:24,309 --> 00:59:25,670
I don't have any holy water here.

702
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,039
Did she stop because I'm in the hall?

703
00:59:30,039 --> 00:59:30,760
The concert hall?

704
00:59:40,139 --> 00:59:40,539
Jesus.

705
00:59:41,179 --> 00:59:43,860
Do I have to play this piano?

706
00:59:48,039 --> 00:59:50,440
The mocap really is the best part of this whole thing.

707
00:59:51,159 --> 00:59:53,849
Just the over actor in front of the screen.

708
00:59:55,659 --> 00:59:57,500
Oh my god, noob just gave 10 community subs.

709
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:01,400
Thank you, oh my god, noob.

710
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,599
Is it us she's looking at?

711
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:03,099
Oh.

712
01:00:09,909 --> 01:00:16,250
Thank you for the 10 community subs.

713
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:27,320
Oh, she's missing the- I get it, right?

714
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:34,099
Well, maybe if you cleaned off the-

715
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:40,469
I know why you can't play the piano

716
01:00:40,469 --> 01:00:42,309
because it's covered in fucking red liquid.

717
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:43,750
Wipe it off.

718
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:46,150
Get some Lysol wipes and wipe the damn thing.

719
01:00:54,469 --> 01:00:55,590
Okay, I couldn't move.

720
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:01,690
What the fuck am I supposed to do?

721
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:04,739
Do I have to play the piano?

722
01:01:05,619 --> 01:01:06,900
The piano is dripping with blood.

723
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:07,400
No.

724
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:10,389
God damn it.

725
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:13,829
Oh, I'm too pa- I have- I can't control the game.

726
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:19,690
I need a special key.

727
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:26,980
What are you doing?

728
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,059
I can't move.

729
01:01:31,059 --> 01:01:32,420
I'm panicking.

730
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:33,539
I look at this run.

731
01:01:35,110 --> 01:01:36,789
I look like a bird.

732
01:01:36,789 --> 01:01:39,750
This is what a bird does right before it panic takes off.

733
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:42,190
Move!

734
01:01:57,510 --> 01:01:58,230
What does that say?

735
01:01:58,230 --> 01:01:58,949
It's right out here.

736
01:02:02,139 --> 01:02:03,579
There's a seagull on the beach.

737
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:06,500
Use the essential oil.

738
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:14,150
It's the Chad stride.

739
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:15,190
The panic Chad.

740
01:02:15,829 --> 01:02:17,110
That's pretty cool.

741
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:18,039
Hold on.

742
01:02:19,139 --> 01:02:21,139
I could drink that, but I got hit.

743
01:02:21,139 --> 01:02:21,860
That's why it happened.

744
01:02:25,769 --> 01:02:28,949
What's the goal here?

745
01:02:28,949 --> 01:02:30,070
Do I even have a goal?

746
01:02:32,469 --> 01:02:33,510
Wait, hold on.

747
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:34,949
Let me look what else is down here

748
01:02:34,949 --> 01:02:36,309
because I don't even have a goal right now.

749
01:02:36,309 --> 01:02:38,550
It's just run away from guy in the piano place.

750
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:40,949
What is this?

751
01:02:41,829 --> 01:02:43,659
Some more lavender water.

752
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:47,960
Let me just see.

753
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,079
Okay, this wraps around.

754
01:02:49,719 --> 01:02:51,320
So I take him out there and run around.

755
01:02:52,199 --> 01:02:53,900
That's the only door I can go in.

756
01:02:54,539 --> 01:03:03,829
Derm, what's your favorite meme?

757
01:03:03,829 --> 01:03:05,510
Oh, definitely the Naruto mirror run.

758
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:10,469
Now we're gonna have to do this again.

759
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:19,320
Yeah, dude, mine too.

760
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:23,769
Basic streamer.

761
01:03:23,769 --> 01:03:24,250
Come on.

762
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:25,369
I'm just kidding around.

763
01:03:25,369 --> 01:03:26,570
You know what my favorite meme is.

764
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:34,650
He does a panic special move.

765
01:03:35,289 --> 01:03:47,019
How do I go from here?

766
01:03:47,019 --> 01:03:48,219
I don't have any other direction.

767
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:52,940
I need a key now.

768
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:53,579
Oh, God.

769
01:03:55,659 --> 01:03:56,780
See, that's the panic move.

770
01:04:01,059 --> 01:04:02,469
I'm right in front of you.

771
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:09,130
They could have made this guy so much better

772
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:09,769
if he was like.

773
01:04:12,010 --> 01:04:25,960
Oh, what's this do?

774
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:29,000
This lever must raise and lower the stage device.

775
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,989
Yes, I'm gonna crash a head.

776
01:04:32,630 --> 01:04:33,510
I'm gonna crush his head.

777
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:41,460
That is spawn another enemy.

778
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:52,010
Sounds like I'm a mannequin.

779
01:04:52,010 --> 01:05:11,510
Don't itch your hair.

780
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:11,989
It looks fine.

781
01:05:11,989 --> 01:05:12,469
Don't do that.

782
01:05:13,349 --> 01:05:18,489
He just dropped a bunch of quarters.

783
01:05:19,369 --> 01:05:20,010
Oh, shit.

784
01:05:20,889 --> 01:05:22,329
That was for my laundry.

785
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:23,530
Fuck.

786
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:27,260
I win.

787
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:32,900
The torso has been crushed.

788
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:34,099
What a horrible death.

789
01:05:34,099 --> 01:05:34,980
He's holding something.

790
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:39,739
I know it's scribbled on a tiny piece of paper.

791
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:42,059
Safe combination equals bad.

792
01:05:44,619 --> 01:05:47,340
1014 is babe, 3403 is dead.

793
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:49,989
Bad.

794
01:05:50,789 --> 01:05:51,110
Babe.

795
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:59,559
So I need to do 103, right?

796
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:03,050
103.

797
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:06,650
I got it.

798
01:06:09,239 --> 01:06:10,840
Where's the safe that they're talking about though?

799
01:06:15,219 --> 01:06:16,260
Bad because babe.

800
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:17,059
Bad because bad.

801
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:20,570
Why is that even a puzzle?

802
01:06:20,570 --> 01:06:21,130
I don't know.

803
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:22,809
Strangely enough.

804
01:06:23,690 --> 01:06:26,820
The piano is drippings with goo.

805
01:06:27,619 --> 01:06:35,030
First person to get what that reference is to.

806
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:38,519
I will give you pretend $100.

807
01:06:38,519 --> 01:06:39,480
A pretend like.

808
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:39,880
Oh, yeah.

809
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:40,519
Whoa, what the heck?

810
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:46,019
Like, not real.

811
01:06:46,019 --> 01:06:46,659
Like, pretend.

812
01:06:47,219 --> 01:06:56,230
Like, I put my hand out and it's like, I pretend to give you my.

813
01:06:58,170 --> 01:06:58,670
Uh-oh.

814
01:06:58,969 --> 01:06:59,929
You're mine now.

815
01:07:07,099 --> 01:07:09,340
I should have guess kept moving, shouldn't I?

816
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:13,800
No, he's regenerating.

817
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,239
He must have taken a nap out there.

818
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:15,800
What the hell?

819
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:22,230
All right, I need a safe.

820
01:07:30,789 --> 01:07:31,289
Duck.

821
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:33,300
Duck.

822
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:51,239
He doesn't know.

823
01:07:53,239 --> 01:07:54,119
He doesn't know.

824
01:08:03,619 --> 01:08:04,119
Fuck.

825
01:08:04,599 --> 01:08:07,369
That was pretty boss.

826
01:08:22,029 --> 01:08:23,470
He doesn't know.

827
01:08:23,470 --> 01:08:26,109
Yeah, let's all like fucking laugh about that guy.

828
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:32,010
He can't hear us.

829
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:33,529
He's wearing AirPods.

830
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:38,539
Yeah, don't tell him.

831
01:08:38,539 --> 01:08:39,739
Don't tell him.

832
01:08:39,739 --> 01:08:40,460
Don't tell him.

833
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:43,529
So he just opened this door.

834
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:46,619
Why can he open this door?

835
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:53,039
And where's I'm trapped in here.

836
01:08:53,039 --> 01:08:53,760
I need a safe.

837
01:08:55,630 --> 01:08:56,670
He has the key then.

838
01:08:56,670 --> 01:09:00,829
So I need to I get to crush his head like a goddamn watermelon.

839
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:03,979
Slow down.

840
01:09:03,979 --> 01:09:05,020
Slow down.

841
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:06,810
What an asshole.

842
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:18,060
They're all off limits.

843
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:18,859
I can't open any of this door.

844
01:09:18,859 --> 01:09:21,260
Is it maybe in the concert hall itself?

845
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:28,909
Was it in?

846
01:09:29,789 --> 01:09:30,750
He's going to get peace back.

847
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:31,310
He's back in.

848
01:09:32,189 --> 01:09:33,149
No, he was just in there.

849
01:09:34,109 --> 01:09:39,979
This is a safe.

850
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:43,500
Oh, this is a safe right here.

851
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:52,369
Okay.

852
01:10:25,149 --> 01:10:27,229
Cloak room lockers with combination locks.

853
01:10:27,229 --> 01:10:28,510
That memo might be helpful.

854
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:30,430
103.

855
01:10:31,229 --> 01:10:36,409
Thank you.

856
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:41,640
Master key.

857
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,000
Now I can go back in there.

858
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:46,279
But oh, let's save it first though.

859
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:53,210
Don't like I don't want to get soft locked.

860
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:55,210
He like breaks in the door the second I press this.

861
01:10:59,260 --> 01:10:59,979
I can leave.

862
01:10:59,979 --> 01:11:03,500
Yeah, but there's a door in the concert hall that I want to open.

863
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,479
German stocks are in.

864
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:09,279
Go buy.

865
01:11:09,279 --> 01:11:09,779
Are they?

866
01:11:16,539 --> 01:11:17,260
Really?

867
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:19,159
I think he's in this room.

868
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:26,939
He's actually just in here, isn't he?

869
01:11:32,539 --> 01:11:33,180
Special key.

870
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:33,979
Use the master key.

871
01:11:33,979 --> 01:11:35,500
Yeah, this is why I wanted to come here.

872
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:48,750
Wait.

873
01:11:56,109 --> 01:11:57,069
Well, this is too.

874
01:11:57,069 --> 01:11:59,550
I can go scary way or I can go not scary way.

875
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:00,670
Oh, I don't like that angle.

876
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,399
It doesn't seem to be anything strange here.

877
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,569
But there is a glowy in the corner.

878
01:12:15,050 --> 01:12:16,409
Lavender water.

879
01:12:16,409 --> 01:12:16,909
Nice.

880
01:12:17,689 --> 01:12:20,279
Anything else in this room?

881
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:25,850
Don't even think about doing it.

882
01:12:26,409 --> 01:12:28,960
Yeah, I know you can speed by.

883
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:30,479
Don't even think about it.

884
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:35,720
It's taunting me.

885
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:40,319
The hell am I?

886
01:12:47,869 --> 01:12:49,869
Some sort of stage device has been lowered.

887
01:12:49,869 --> 01:12:51,550
I can't get through if it's not raced.

888
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:52,829
God damn it.

889
01:12:52,829 --> 01:12:56,859
I have to go down and press that button again.

890
01:13:01,979 --> 01:13:03,340
There's something sitting right there.

891
01:13:08,079 --> 01:13:09,680
Joop sightings more frequent.

892
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:11,119
We got storm signs.

893
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,789
It's just a candle.

894
01:13:14,350 --> 01:13:16,439
I don't know what the heck that could be.

895
01:13:16,439 --> 01:13:18,279
It could be something that I need.

896
01:13:18,279 --> 01:13:18,600
I don't know.

897
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:23,529
It's one of those survival horror video games from the 90s.

898
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:27,210
I'm just going to come out 90s.

899
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:33,319
When Chad is bored, they spend Jupiter.

900
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,600
I'm glad they can find a good use of their time.

901
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:41,069
Hey, what you should be doing is when you get bored

902
01:13:41,069 --> 01:13:42,750
and you don't get bored with the game,

903
01:13:44,399 --> 01:13:49,199
open up a tab and get some physicist shit.

904
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,520
Do like physicist 101.

905
01:13:56,489 --> 01:13:56,810
Hold on.

906
01:13:56,810 --> 01:13:57,689
Let me check what's over here.

907
01:13:58,489 --> 01:14:07,689
Why have I not created a space agency?

908
01:14:08,489 --> 01:14:10,250
What the heck were you talking about, man?

909
01:14:11,449 --> 01:14:11,770
Get up.

910
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:15,319
Panic?

911
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,159
Don't think so.

912
01:14:17,159 --> 01:14:18,600
I'm going to be drinking one of these.

913
01:14:27,069 --> 01:14:28,590
Isn't that supposed to alleviate panic?

914
01:14:29,310 --> 01:14:30,350
Did I miss something here?

915
01:14:30,909 --> 01:14:37,760
Why is he faster than me on the stairs?

916
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:41,050
Oh, where am I going?

917
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:41,609
Oh, great.

918
01:14:41,609 --> 01:14:43,289
A dead end with lockers.

919
01:14:43,289 --> 01:14:43,689
Wait a minute.

920
01:14:44,569 --> 01:14:47,930
Wait, no, no, no.

921
01:14:47,930 --> 01:14:48,409
I thought...

922
01:14:48,409 --> 01:14:48,810
Okay, wait.

923
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:49,289
Hold on.

924
01:14:49,289 --> 01:14:49,789
No.

925
01:14:51,449 --> 01:14:54,619
Does he know I'm in here?

926
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:59,449
We'll try a different place.

927
01:15:00,890 --> 01:15:19,210
That's not a way to go.

928
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:20,090
This is though, right?

929
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:21,689
That's great.

930
01:15:29,869 --> 01:15:32,409
Try attacking?

931
01:15:32,409 --> 01:15:33,210
I don't have...

932
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:33,930
I don't have anything.

933
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:42,199
I have an empty bottle of like liquor in my safe spot.

934
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:59,760
It works every time.

935
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:15,159
Are you kidding me?

936
01:16:15,159 --> 01:16:16,039
I almost choked.

937
01:16:16,039 --> 01:16:16,359
Hold on.

938
01:16:16,359 --> 01:16:16,840
I spilled.

939
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:19,079
I was taking a sip.

940
01:16:22,359 --> 01:16:22,760
Hold on.

941
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:33,680
It's all right.

942
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:34,399
It's not that bad.

943
01:16:38,329 --> 01:16:39,449
It's just a little coffee.

944
01:16:40,409 --> 01:16:43,800
Thank you for that cool original spill joke.

945
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,319
I didn't...

946
01:16:45,319 --> 01:16:46,279
I didn't buy it.

947
01:16:58,779 --> 01:17:04,409
This time I'm going to start...

948
01:17:04,409 --> 01:17:08,409
I'm going to know that I just raised the thing.

949
01:17:08,409 --> 01:17:12,090
I hate this fucking bird chat run so much.

950
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:21,319
Really?

951
01:17:21,319 --> 01:17:22,119
Come on.

952
01:17:22,119 --> 01:17:33,550
Why is he not seeing me?

953
01:17:34,510 --> 01:17:37,869
Can I raise this when he's on it maybe?

954
01:17:37,869 --> 01:17:39,069
Maybe I can like fuck him up.

955
01:17:39,069 --> 01:17:39,630
Do it.

956
01:17:39,630 --> 01:17:40,430
Press the button.

957
01:17:41,069 --> 01:17:41,789
Press the button.

958
01:17:43,789 --> 01:18:01,529
He has no idea.

959
01:18:01,529 --> 01:18:02,810
This is the same spot for real.

960
01:18:03,609 --> 01:18:08,319
I don't want to just die though and restart.

961
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:14,319
Because I just have to raise that and go upstairs again.

962
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:16,560
All right, he's gone.

963
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,770
He's gone, right?

964
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:20,170
Yep, okay.

965
01:18:21,050 --> 01:18:24,590
I used my magic item though.

966
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:29,130
I used like the Frodo chainmail thing.

967
01:18:29,130 --> 01:18:31,369
You only get to use that once for a plot device in a movie.

968
01:18:31,369 --> 01:18:32,170
I don't have another one.

969
01:18:32,810 --> 01:18:50,649
Half-Life 2 game sounds.

970
01:18:51,289 --> 01:18:53,689
Just cross the bridge.

971
01:18:54,649 --> 01:19:00,159
Get out of here and continue your let's play of Clock Tower 3.

972
01:19:07,479 --> 01:19:12,039
He's going to show up again here.

973
01:19:14,109 --> 01:19:14,909
He has to, right?

974
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:23,960
The lantern is not lit.

975
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:28,140
Told you I was going to need that fucking candle.

976
01:19:29,550 --> 01:19:30,189
I told you.

977
01:19:34,409 --> 01:19:36,090
Everybody was like it's just a candle.

978
01:19:41,850 --> 01:19:43,449
It's just a candle, dummy.

979
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:45,449
It's not just a candle.

980
01:19:46,489 --> 01:19:56,159
It's too dark to cross.

981
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:01,760
Where's the other candle?

982
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:07,439
I can't pick that up.

983
01:20:08,319 --> 01:20:08,640
Why?

984
01:20:28,010 --> 01:20:30,750
Do you get why we said this is a bad game?

985
01:20:31,710 --> 01:20:33,550
Not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet.

986
01:20:36,430 --> 01:20:46,489
This way?

987
01:20:46,970 --> 01:20:47,529
I didn't know.

988
01:20:47,529 --> 01:20:55,210
Am I right behind the counter?

989
01:20:55,210 --> 01:20:56,569
That didn't work last time.

990
01:20:57,369 --> 01:21:07,479
Can I just leave?

991
01:21:08,359 --> 01:21:10,079
I have the key, right?

992
01:21:11,279 --> 01:21:15,920
I can just leave and go out the front door.

993
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:22,699
I'm trying to find elaborate ways to get out of here.

994
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:38,010
Oh god, it's a fountain.

995
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:39,289
It's not a holy water fountain.

996
01:21:40,329 --> 01:21:48,779
Candle or something out here?

997
01:21:49,739 --> 01:21:50,699
Is there a light out here?

998
01:21:51,819 --> 01:21:52,220
Candle?

999
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:53,979
A light source?

1000
01:21:54,859 --> 01:21:56,060
A way to light the way?

1001
01:21:57,020 --> 01:22:10,350
Don't panic, please.

1002
01:22:10,350 --> 01:22:11,869
Don't panic, don't panic, don't panic, don't panic.

1003
01:22:12,670 --> 01:22:14,840
Out, out, out, out.

1004
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:15,399
Leave me alone.

1005
01:22:16,199 --> 01:22:17,319
Leave me alone.

1006
01:22:18,359 --> 01:22:19,159
Get away from me.

1007
01:22:20,119 --> 01:22:20,600
No.

1008
01:22:22,199 --> 01:22:30,760
Stop panicking.

1009
01:22:31,399 --> 01:22:32,199
Stop.

1010
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:33,239
Why?

1011
01:22:35,239 --> 01:22:46,090
Okay, I don't, I don't want to soft lock myself.

1012
01:22:46,090 --> 01:22:49,130
Where the, why the fuck am I supposed to go?

1013
01:22:50,569 --> 01:22:53,710
Not that way either.

1014
01:22:55,069 --> 01:23:01,310
People.

1015
01:23:05,819 --> 01:23:07,659
You use the water and the water doesn't work, does it?

1016
01:23:08,699 --> 01:23:13,520
I'm actually glad that happened.

1017
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:14,960
You know why I'm glad that happened?

1018
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:18,479
Because going up stairs was a waste of time

1019
01:23:18,479 --> 01:23:20,319
and I used a couple of items for no reason.

1020
01:23:21,359 --> 01:23:24,159
So I'm just gonna walk out the front goddamn door.

1021
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:31,739
This is right before I raised the thing.

1022
01:23:31,739 --> 01:23:32,220
No, it's not.

1023
01:23:32,939 --> 01:23:36,800
It auto saved.

1024
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:48,960
It was a sigil,

1025
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:50,720
there was a sigil on one of the doors, wasn't there?

1026
01:23:51,439 --> 01:23:55,949
Just trying to lose them.

1027
01:23:56,989 --> 01:23:59,470
I'm trying to find like a good place where I can like lose them out here.

1028
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:11,020
Give me some holy water.

1029
01:24:18,909 --> 01:24:20,750
Holy water is about to be achieved.

1030
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:21,069
Got it.

1031
01:24:23,390 --> 01:24:24,989
Let's just save it here anyways.

1032
01:24:31,739 --> 01:24:32,779
Zero, zero, zero.

1033
01:24:33,739 --> 01:24:34,920
Oh, there it is.

1034
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:39,479
I'm gonna go YouTube the ending

1035
01:24:39,479 --> 01:24:41,640
because Jerma's never going to beat this game.

1036
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:48,430
Am I nice to expect it to?

1037
01:24:49,069 --> 01:24:49,949
All right, holy water.

1038
01:24:50,510 --> 01:24:50,989
Where is he?

1039
01:24:52,510 --> 01:24:53,720
Where is he?

1040
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:56,199
He lost me.

1041
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:11,600
Up here there's a door, there's a sigil on one of the doors.

1042
01:25:13,439 --> 01:25:14,760
He's already back.

1043
01:25:17,319 --> 01:25:35,149
It'd be impossible for him to know that I was here.

1044
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:47,470
There's no way he would know I was here.

1045
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,039
Now he's sniffing the air.

1046
01:25:55,039 --> 01:25:55,760
God damn it.

1047
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:57,600
I'm like a pie on a windowsill.

1048
01:25:58,159 --> 01:26:00,159
No, don't come in here.

1049
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:16,199
Let's get a save point with two dashes of holy water.

1050
01:26:22,109 --> 01:26:25,149
So now it was upstairs, not...

1051
01:26:26,510 --> 01:26:29,659
It was back where the lockers were.

1052
01:26:30,619 --> 01:26:32,000
I forgot how to get there.

1053
01:26:41,390 --> 01:26:42,430
So it was up here.

1054
01:26:49,289 --> 01:26:50,649
What the fuck are you guys doing?

1055
01:26:56,699 --> 01:26:57,260
Other side.

1056
01:27:00,010 --> 01:27:04,720
Are you playing the piano again?

1057
01:27:05,279 --> 01:27:06,600
Are you back?

1058
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:09,130
Hey, can we talk?

1059
01:27:09,130 --> 01:27:11,369
She's playing the piano so earnestly.

1060
01:27:11,369 --> 01:27:12,569
What is she trying to express?

1061
01:27:14,510 --> 01:27:20,430
Good thing I have one still.

1062
01:27:21,149 --> 01:27:22,890
That's scary.

1063
01:27:23,449 --> 01:27:25,930
Of course I'm gonna throw holy water at the scary thing of the piano.

1064
01:27:27,739 --> 01:27:29,739
I didn't know if she was gonna like turn and jump scare me

1065
01:27:29,739 --> 01:27:31,420
or try to eat me or bite me or something.

1066
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:31,739
I don't know.

1067
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:45,159
God damn it.

1068
01:27:45,159 --> 01:27:45,960
Where is he?

1069
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:47,710
You're mine.

1070
01:27:47,710 --> 01:27:50,029
Really could have used that second splash of holy water.

1071
01:27:50,029 --> 01:27:50,750
Couldn't you, Jeremy?

1072
01:27:51,390 --> 01:27:53,630
Instead of throwing it at the little ghost girl.

1073
01:27:54,430 --> 01:28:10,239
Where is it?

1074
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:11,359
Where's the door?

1075
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:13,199
Right there?

1076
01:28:19,149 --> 01:28:19,470
Go!

1077
01:28:19,470 --> 01:28:20,350
Get in the door!

1078
01:28:20,350 --> 01:28:21,069
Get in the door!

1079
01:28:21,069 --> 01:28:21,789
What are you doing?

1080
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:24,199
Oh yeah.

1081
01:28:25,319 --> 01:28:32,699
Okay.

1082
01:28:32,699 --> 01:28:40,270
This is the stadium seating.

1083
01:28:40,909 --> 01:28:43,289
These are the less expensive seats.

1084
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:47,819
Check all the corners.

1085
01:28:47,819 --> 01:28:48,779
Okay, there's a door here.

1086
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:52,119
I don't know what this is gonna lead to.

1087
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:56,699
It's locked from the other side.

1088
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:59,960
We need a light source.

1089
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:02,539
This is just open.

1090
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:04,840
This is pretty disheveled.

1091
01:29:05,479 --> 01:29:08,170
I wonder who invented this instrument anyway.

1092
01:29:09,789 --> 01:29:10,270
The harp?

1093
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:13,500
I don't know.

1094
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:17,819
The harp is a really kind of fucked up item, isn't it?

1095
01:29:19,659 --> 01:29:19,899
Map.

1096
01:29:19,899 --> 01:29:20,779
There we go.

1097
01:29:20,779 --> 01:29:21,180
Matches.

1098
01:29:21,979 --> 01:29:26,460
The harp is like a gigantic underwater guitar.

1099
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,720
It's huge and strange and looks like it belongs

1100
01:29:33,119 --> 01:29:34,000
like a Disney movie.

1101
01:29:38,399 --> 01:29:39,279
Sounds beautiful though.

1102
01:29:39,279 --> 01:29:40,560
It's a beautiful instrument.

1103
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:45,340
All right.

1104
01:29:45,340 --> 01:29:46,300
I got what I needed.

1105
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:49,600
The nut's down here.

1106
01:29:54,329 --> 01:29:59,479
How am I gonna beat rid of this guy?

1107
01:30:01,159 --> 01:30:02,920
Is he gonna give me a chance out of the cutscene?

1108
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:05,479
I gotta drink that laughing potion right now

1109
01:30:05,479 --> 01:30:07,399
before I go into a panic drink.

1110
01:30:09,439 --> 01:30:09,840
Okay.

1111
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:10,560
Hold on here.

1112
01:30:13,119 --> 01:30:18,750
It's a high quality bait right there.

1113
01:30:20,189 --> 01:30:22,029
Can I go underneath this?

1114
01:30:22,510 --> 01:30:25,310
Oh my god.

1115
01:30:25,310 --> 01:30:26,189
Thank god.

1116
01:30:27,149 --> 01:30:28,029
Is he stuck?

1117
01:30:28,029 --> 01:30:28,989
Was I supposed to do that?

1118
01:30:29,869 --> 01:30:36,380
Invisibility bench.

1119
01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:37,020
Should I use this?

1120
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:39,979
Oh shit.

1121
01:30:40,699 --> 01:30:41,100
Oh shit.

1122
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:41,739
Can I get through?

1123
01:30:42,699 --> 01:30:43,180
I can't.

1124
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:43,659
Good.

1125
01:30:43,659 --> 01:30:44,300
Fuck this guy.

1126
01:30:47,420 --> 01:30:47,739
All right.

1127
01:30:47,739 --> 01:30:49,100
Let's go light the torch.

1128
01:30:52,619 --> 01:30:55,600
Can't find me.

1129
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,159
Should I just sit in one of the seats?

1130
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:08,520
Hi.

1131
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:17,760
There's like a chest over there.

1132
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:18,800
I can't even do anything.

1133
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:19,600
I have to just leave.

1134
01:31:22,239 --> 01:31:29,340
Hiding.

1135
01:31:29,979 --> 01:31:30,939
There is no hiding.

1136
01:31:31,579 --> 01:31:33,420
It's one of those tank control games

1137
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:35,020
where you can't even see the...

1138
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:36,460
They'll give you one camera angle.

1139
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:45,680
There is one.

1140
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:46,319
We are in a...

1141
01:31:47,199 --> 01:32:09,800
Fight that thing.

1142
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:10,840
He's already on me.

1143
01:32:12,199 --> 01:32:13,199
All right.

1144
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:13,520
I need to...

1145
01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:18,329
And can I do the invisibility band?

1146
01:32:25,159 --> 01:32:25,319
Take.

1147
01:32:25,319 --> 01:32:25,960
I'm gonna do it here.

1148
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:31,399
I'm invisible now.

1149
01:32:31,399 --> 01:32:36,600
Just enough to...

1150
01:32:41,180 --> 01:32:41,420
Light.

1151
01:32:41,979 --> 01:32:50,430
The light from the lantern illuminates the room.

1152
01:32:53,289 --> 01:33:00,800
Fuck.

1153
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,079
I don't want to screw this up.

1154
01:33:02,079 --> 01:33:03,199
How do I stop that from happening?

1155
01:33:03,199 --> 01:33:03,520
How am I...

1156
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:04,239
Why am I doing that?

1157
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:07,920
I didn't read the manual about

1158
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:16,279
walking across the board.

1159
01:33:16,279 --> 01:33:17,720
At this point just fall forward.

1160
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:17,960
Okay?

1161
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:23,020
Flyers.

1162
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:26,279
The door with the barbed wire on it.

1163
01:33:26,279 --> 01:33:27,399
Where was that door though?

1164
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:30,039
There was that barbed wire door.

1165
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:32,560
Which one was that?

1166
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:33,199
Where was that?

1167
01:33:38,409 --> 01:33:39,050
Bottom floor?

1168
01:33:46,239 --> 01:33:46,880
Start of the game.

1169
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:47,680
It was in the house.

1170
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:50,960
No, I know.

1171
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:52,000
I know I saw it somewhere.

1172
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,560
Don't fall off and make me start over.

1173
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:58,279
Should I put on the Harry Potter invisibility cloak?

1174
01:33:59,470 --> 01:33:59,869
Please.

1175
01:34:03,899 --> 01:34:05,020
Fall joke incoming.

1176
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:06,060
I'm not going to do that.

1177
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:06,939
Not in a game like this.

1178
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:14,319
That requires backtracking

1179
01:34:14,319 --> 01:34:16,560
and then I have a save point from...

1180
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:17,760
Oh, here we go again.

1181
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:24,159
I think that's my mother.

1182
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:25,119
That's gonna be my mom.

1183
01:34:28,619 --> 01:34:30,060
Backtracking but with a secret door?

1184
01:34:34,279 --> 01:34:34,920
Um...

1185
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:36,649
What do I...

1186
01:34:36,649 --> 01:34:37,529
What do I do about this?

1187
01:34:38,890 --> 01:34:40,010
Mom, help me!

1188
01:34:40,010 --> 01:34:40,569
Mom, like get...

1189
01:34:41,369 --> 01:34:50,109
Okay, you didn't...

1190
01:34:50,109 --> 01:34:50,750
I got put in...

1191
01:34:50,750 --> 01:34:51,069
I got...

1192
01:34:51,069 --> 01:34:51,869
Out of the cut scene.

1193
01:34:52,750 --> 01:34:53,149
Okay.

1194
01:34:53,149 --> 01:34:54,350
Out of the cut scene.

1195
01:34:54,350 --> 01:34:54,989
I couldn't move.

1196
01:34:55,789 --> 01:35:03,470
It worked!

1197
01:35:03,470 --> 01:35:03,949
It worked!

1198
01:35:04,989 --> 01:35:13,739
Come on!

1199
01:35:13,739 --> 01:35:14,380
Come on, come on, come on!

1200
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:15,180
Out, out, out, out, out!

1201
01:35:16,140 --> 01:35:22,909
Okay, I gotta get...

1202
01:35:22,909 --> 01:35:23,550
I just gotta leave.

1203
01:35:25,069 --> 01:35:38,810
Where am I going?

1204
01:35:38,810 --> 01:35:39,130
Oh, no!

1205
01:35:39,130 --> 01:35:39,930
I had to go the other way.

1206
01:35:40,729 --> 01:35:41,130
Shit!

1207
01:35:42,170 --> 01:35:48,380
Leave!

1208
01:35:55,039 --> 01:35:55,600
Okay, I'm fine.

1209
01:36:02,699 --> 01:36:03,420
Leave.

1210
01:36:03,420 --> 01:36:06,699
I'm stuck on shit.

1211
01:36:06,699 --> 01:36:07,659
Oh, hey, mom!

1212
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:12,199
Oh, you could like fly in his face

1213
01:36:12,199 --> 01:36:13,560
and like sprinkle dust in his eyes.

1214
01:36:15,159 --> 01:36:15,640
I have to do it.

1215
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:16,039
I have to do it.

1216
01:36:16,039 --> 01:36:16,279
I have to do it.

1217
01:36:16,279 --> 01:36:17,319
I have to do it.

1218
01:36:17,319 --> 01:36:33,340
Hey, Jerma.

1219
01:36:33,340 --> 01:36:34,699
I'm back from YouTubing the ending

1220
01:36:34,699 --> 01:36:36,060
and this game is fucking whack.

1221
01:36:42,359 --> 01:36:42,680
Thanks.

1222
01:36:47,789 --> 01:36:48,350
Okay, I...

1223
01:36:50,300 --> 01:36:51,180
I hate this guy.

1224
01:36:56,319 --> 01:37:10,079
Splash in eyes.

1225
01:37:10,079 --> 01:37:10,560
Refill.

1226
01:37:14,250 --> 01:37:14,970
No, no, no.

1227
01:37:14,970 --> 01:37:16,250
I don't want to save it right here.

1228
01:37:18,090 --> 01:37:18,649
Refill.

1229
01:37:20,329 --> 01:37:28,810
Oh, refill.

1230
01:37:30,989 --> 01:37:31,229
Run.

1231
01:37:34,829 --> 01:37:36,750
Come on, mom!

1232
01:37:36,750 --> 01:37:39,279
What the fuck are you doing, mom?

1233
01:37:39,279 --> 01:37:39,760
Hey!

1234
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:41,119
What the hell are you doing?

1235
01:37:42,159 --> 01:37:43,680
Why did you do that to me?

1236
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:48,920
You're supposed to be guiding me.

1237
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:49,800
Do that to him.

1238
01:37:59,420 --> 01:38:00,140
They made that...

1239
01:38:00,859 --> 01:38:01,100
They...

1240
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:03,850
You don't introduce a character like that.

1241
01:38:03,850 --> 01:38:07,050
The floating purple glittery butterfly.

1242
01:38:09,159 --> 01:38:10,439
Oh, I'm guiding you.

1243
01:38:10,439 --> 01:38:12,520
Look, I'm here and it's a bad guy.

1244
01:38:13,470 --> 01:38:14,109
That was great.

1245
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:22,939
That's not your mom or an ally.

1246
01:38:22,939 --> 01:38:23,979
I don't know what...

1247
01:38:23,979 --> 01:38:24,859
Butterflies in...

1248
01:38:24,859 --> 01:38:25,659
It's a video game.

1249
01:38:26,380 --> 01:38:27,819
No, I want the save point that I had.

1250
01:38:28,539 --> 01:38:29,340
No, I didn't have it.

1251
01:38:33,930 --> 01:38:35,130
How am I supposed to think?

1252
01:38:35,130 --> 01:38:36,409
It's a horror game

1253
01:38:36,409 --> 01:38:38,890
and there's a shiny, beautiful butterfly

1254
01:38:38,890 --> 01:38:41,369
that has been shown a few times during the game.

1255
01:38:42,489 --> 01:38:44,920
I need to...

1256
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:45,319
I'm dead.

1257
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:55,640
Watch out for the butterfly.

1258
01:38:57,399 --> 01:39:00,600
The sonar stingray thing that just flies around.

1259
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:02,199
The bat.

1260
01:39:09,819 --> 01:39:10,140
Lake.

1261
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:12,779
Thank you, Lake Drinker, for the five community subs.

1262
01:39:14,060 --> 01:39:21,800
All right, where's that room?

1263
01:39:25,550 --> 01:39:26,640
It's like down here?

1264
01:39:28,159 --> 01:39:28,560
I don't even...

1265
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:29,199
I have no idea.

1266
01:39:31,199 --> 01:39:32,760
In here?

1267
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:36,489
In here?

1268
01:39:40,430 --> 01:39:41,390
Not down here, is it?

1269
01:39:47,149 --> 01:39:47,550
There it is.

1270
01:39:48,189 --> 01:39:52,399
The suppliers go indoor.

1271
01:39:53,039 --> 01:39:58,189
They lose the sky.

1272
01:39:59,149 --> 01:40:01,520
Okay, I think I'm safe.

1273
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:02,079
Am I safe?

1274
01:40:03,710 --> 01:40:04,189
I think so.

1275
01:40:04,670 --> 01:40:08,699
A carved wooden box.

1276
01:40:08,699 --> 01:40:09,500
Open it.

1277
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:09,739
Yes.

1278
01:40:10,539 --> 01:40:18,720
Is this supposed to be me?

1279
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:29,659
Oh, you're doing a very good job playing the piano, Lissa.

1280
01:40:29,659 --> 01:40:30,460
That's the big reveal.

1281
01:40:30,460 --> 01:40:31,180
Like, what the fuck?

1282
01:40:31,180 --> 01:40:32,060
It's that guy's voice.

1283
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:02,800
You're the most precious thing to me in the whole world.

1284
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:04,399
But don't worry.

1285
01:41:05,199 --> 01:41:08,159
Daddy, don't forget the piano concourse is on Christmas Eve.

1286
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:11,279
The winner will have their performance aired on the radio.

1287
01:41:12,079 --> 01:41:14,399
I'll practice really hard and win the contest

1288
01:41:15,039 --> 01:41:17,119
so that you can hear me when you're out in the war.

1289
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:18,800
That would be wonderful.

1290
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:20,880
The competition will be stiff,

1291
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:22,880
but if you go to your lessons and practice properly,

1292
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:24,000
I'm sure you can do it.

1293
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:26,000
I'll practice every day.

1294
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:29,199
I've already chosen the piece I'm going to play.

1295
01:41:29,199 --> 01:41:36,380
Listen, you told me this watch was a present from mommy

1296
01:41:36,380 --> 01:41:38,060
before you got married, remember?

1297
01:41:38,060 --> 01:41:40,539
Is this like the narrator from Peppa Pig?

1298
01:41:40,539 --> 01:41:42,220
So you can think of mommy and me.

1299
01:41:42,220 --> 01:41:44,300
Then it'll be like we're all together again.

1300
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:45,819
She sounds like she's like 50.

1301
01:41:46,779 --> 01:42:00,000
What a weird piano.

1302
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:02,560
Wait, what the fuck?

1303
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:25,680
It's fucking horrible.

1304
01:42:25,680 --> 01:42:26,720
Why would they do this?

1305
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:42,600
What the fuck?

1306
01:42:44,359 --> 01:42:45,079
That was too-

1307
01:42:45,079 --> 01:42:46,359
That was too fast.

1308
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,210
That was too fast.

1309
01:42:50,090 --> 01:42:55,710
Oh my god, that was awful.

1310
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:00,640
Holy shit.

1311
01:43:01,439 --> 01:43:06,909
I didn't even have any time to fucking process

1312
01:43:06,909 --> 01:43:07,949
what I just looked at.

1313
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:11,560
It was just, all of a sudden the guy flies.

1314
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:13,640
Oh my god.

1315
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:20,439
All right, the hammer killer.

1316
01:43:27,130 --> 01:43:29,850
Robert Morris, 32, the man known as the hammer killer,

1317
01:43:29,850 --> 01:43:30,649
has been hanged.

1318
01:43:31,210 --> 01:43:33,449
Rumors regarding Morris's death are widespread.

1319
01:43:33,449 --> 01:43:36,729
One witness reported he was hanging for a very long time,

1320
01:43:36,729 --> 01:43:39,689
pulling on the straps and making unearthly noises.

1321
01:43:39,689 --> 01:43:41,689
And blood was oozing through the black cap.

1322
01:43:41,689 --> 01:43:42,970
The stench was terrible.

1323
01:43:42,970 --> 01:43:44,970
Some witnesses fainted and were carried out.

1324
01:43:46,250 --> 01:43:47,529
This is too many things.

1325
01:43:47,529 --> 01:43:49,210
Can we just go back to when they were playing the piano?

1326
01:43:49,770 --> 01:43:51,210
Too many things happened in a row here.

1327
01:43:52,890 --> 01:43:55,130
Morris's first victim was Tony Flanagan,

1328
01:43:55,130 --> 01:43:58,170
a fellow employee at the Banbury stone cutting factory.

1329
01:44:00,079 --> 01:44:05,760
On June 6th, Morris suddenly struck Flanagan on the head with a hammer.

1330
01:44:08,239 --> 01:44:31,359
Sensory overload, I'm sorry guys.

1331
01:44:32,159 --> 01:44:33,279
None of this is like comedic.

1332
01:44:33,279 --> 01:44:35,439
It's just like too much sensory overload.

1333
01:44:35,439 --> 01:44:38,720
Killing him instantly, all five workers present were killed in the same manner.

1334
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:39,840
Morris disappeared thereafter.

1335
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:42,720
A string of similar crimes occurred until the time of Morris's arrest

1336
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,560
on the 6th of March.

1337
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:49,119
Morris's victim is numbered 12 and no clear motive has been determined.

1338
01:44:50,380 --> 01:44:54,060
Specialists continue to be baffled by the seemingly abrupt change in his behavior,

1339
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:56,060
as well as the extreme violence of his crime.

1340
01:44:56,699 --> 01:44:58,619
Kind of like the last five minutes of the game.

1341
01:44:59,420 --> 01:45:02,060
An extreme abrupt change in tone.

1342
01:45:03,100 --> 01:45:12,159
Maybe I can save May if I get her father's pocket watch to her.

1343
01:45:12,159 --> 01:45:14,479
Okay, I have to take the pocket watch to the concert hall.

1344
01:45:23,609 --> 01:45:24,970
Okay, is that guy still here?

1345
01:45:25,609 --> 01:45:32,489
The stream will pause suddenly for no...

1346
01:45:32,489 --> 01:45:33,529
I got no drop frames.

1347
01:45:36,399 --> 01:45:37,840
I have zero drop frames so far.

1348
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:40,199
Is the stream having a problem?

1349
01:45:47,479 --> 01:45:48,520
It was muting you.

1350
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:51,239
Oh, that's weird.

1351
01:45:51,239 --> 01:45:51,880
I don't know why.

1352
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:55,000
All right, so I get the pocket watch back to mom.

1353
01:45:58,170 --> 01:46:00,329
I have to take the pocket watch to the concert hall.

1354
01:46:03,689 --> 01:46:04,970
Your voice is bad.

1355
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:08,060
Like sound quality coming through,

1356
01:46:08,060 --> 01:46:10,859
or you just think you don't like how I sound, you hate my accent or something.

1357
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:31,529
All right, here he comes.

1358
01:46:32,329 --> 01:46:33,369
Back to the concert hall.

1359
01:46:40,380 --> 01:46:41,020
Extreme.

1360
01:46:57,789 --> 01:46:58,510
No butterflies?

1361
01:46:58,510 --> 01:47:00,270
No... what is that?

1362
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:01,470
There's a glowing thing down there.

1363
01:47:02,350 --> 01:47:03,710
Is there a way I can get down here?

1364
01:47:07,100 --> 01:47:07,899
Yes, there is.

1365
01:47:07,899 --> 01:47:09,020
Yes, yes, yes.

1366
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:16,079
Oh, cool.

1367
01:47:18,380 --> 01:47:19,180
Lavender water.

1368
01:47:19,739 --> 01:47:28,140
Stop calling them butterflies.

1369
01:47:28,140 --> 01:47:29,020
They're moths.

1370
01:47:29,979 --> 01:47:36,600
What does it say?

1371
01:47:41,180 --> 01:47:42,380
He, he, he, he, lamp.

1372
01:47:42,380 --> 01:47:43,739
He, he, what does that mean?

1373
01:47:43,739 --> 01:47:53,260
Am I mad?

1374
01:47:53,260 --> 01:47:59,760
He doesn't know.

1375
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:00,399
He doesn't know.

1376
01:48:09,159 --> 01:48:10,199
Yeah, I've been waiting for you.

1377
01:48:10,199 --> 01:48:12,119
You figured me out, little girl.

1378
01:48:14,039 --> 01:48:16,409
It's like it's the Hammer Killer.

1379
01:48:16,409 --> 01:48:18,090
They thought they got rid of me that day,

1380
01:48:18,090 --> 01:48:26,560
and they got us because it was only the beginning, next.

1381
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:30,920
A lot of random...

1382
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:35,529
All right, boss battles.

1383
01:48:35,529 --> 01:48:37,449
This is an actual boss battle.

1384
01:48:38,670 --> 01:48:39,149
Control...

1385
01:48:39,949 --> 01:48:41,310
Duck shoot arrow.

1386
01:48:43,319 --> 01:48:44,279
We have arrows.

1387
01:48:46,119 --> 01:48:48,760
Shoot arrow, charge arrow, super attack.

1388
01:48:50,250 --> 01:48:51,529
Hold down triangle button,

1389
01:48:51,529 --> 01:48:54,489
or hold down triangle button with enemy transfixed.

1390
01:48:55,210 --> 01:48:56,569
R1 is special.

1391
01:48:59,770 --> 01:49:00,569
Battle strategy.

1392
01:49:00,569 --> 01:49:01,529
In order to defeat the enemy,

1393
01:49:01,529 --> 01:49:03,289
Alyssa must first transfix it.

1394
01:49:03,930 --> 01:49:06,489
By hitting the enemy with a charged arrow,

1395
01:49:06,489 --> 01:49:09,050
it is possible to fix them to the spot.

1396
01:49:09,770 --> 01:49:11,770
Several strategically placed chains

1397
01:49:11,770 --> 01:49:13,689
will transfix the target.

1398
01:49:14,489 --> 01:49:17,289
Aim so that the chains fan out from the target

1399
01:49:17,289 --> 01:49:18,649
who should be in the center.

1400
01:49:19,850 --> 01:49:21,289
While the enemy is transfixed,

1401
01:49:21,289 --> 01:49:23,850
Alyssa is able to carry out a super attack.

1402
01:49:23,850 --> 01:49:25,449
It is no easy task, however,

1403
01:49:25,449 --> 01:49:27,050
to hit the target with the arrow.

1404
01:49:27,050 --> 01:49:28,489
Watch the enemy's movements closely

1405
01:49:28,489 --> 01:49:29,529
and wait for your chance.

1406
01:49:30,729 --> 01:49:33,369
Duck can be used to avoid attack by certain enemies.

1407
01:49:33,369 --> 01:49:34,649
It may also cause them to become

1408
01:49:34,649 --> 01:49:36,090
careless and vulnerable to attack.

1409
01:49:36,890 --> 01:49:39,770
Press the R1 button to use special arrows

1410
01:49:39,770 --> 01:49:41,689
such as the repellent arrow

1411
01:49:41,689 --> 01:49:45,050
in order in which they were obtained.

1412
01:49:45,050 --> 01:49:46,489
It is wise to save these weapons

1413
01:49:46,489 --> 01:49:47,609
for special occasions.

1414
01:49:50,279 --> 01:49:51,560
So let me get this straight.

1415
01:49:51,560 --> 01:49:53,560
So shoot arrow is triangle.

1416
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:54,840
You want to charge the arrow

1417
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:56,439
and then shoot them with a charged arrow

1418
01:49:58,279 --> 01:49:59,239
to transfix them.

1419
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,399
So you lock them in a spot

1420
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:06,319
and then there will be chains

1421
01:50:07,199 --> 01:50:08,960
that are placed around the map here

1422
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:10,159
that will transfix them.

1423
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:14,060
So the chains fan out from the target

1424
01:50:14,060 --> 01:50:15,420
should be in the center of the target.

1425
01:50:16,380 --> 01:50:17,369
Let's just...

1426
01:50:17,369 --> 01:50:18,890
I have no fucking idea what's going on.

1427
01:50:23,439 --> 01:50:27,020
Am I actually getting...

1428
01:50:27,020 --> 01:50:28,939
Am I gonna do a transformation sequence here?

1429
01:50:29,899 --> 01:50:30,970
I am.

1430
01:50:30,970 --> 01:50:32,890
Now don't come out in the superhero outfit, please.

1431
01:50:41,289 --> 01:50:42,810
Here comes the transform sequence.

1432
01:50:42,810 --> 01:50:45,449
Hopefully we get some like pop music behind.

1433
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:50,880
No, it's just a staple gun.

1434
01:50:57,260 --> 01:50:58,460
Somehow she knows how to use it.

1435
01:50:59,180 --> 01:51:08,510
Uh, if you're done, I'd like to begin.

1436
01:51:10,510 --> 01:51:11,229
Sledgehammer.

1437
01:51:13,050 --> 01:51:14,329
Victims 26.

1438
01:51:16,159 --> 01:51:19,199
Sentenced to 486 years in prison.

1439
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:21,340
I have to...

1440
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:22,140
Wait, I'm the judge?

1441
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:23,819
Judgment.

1442
01:51:25,119 --> 01:51:26,479
This is a different video game.

1443
01:51:37,020 --> 01:51:37,579
Okay.

1444
01:51:39,449 --> 01:51:40,409
Get up, Alyssa.

1445
01:51:41,289 --> 01:51:43,979
So there's also evade too.

1446
01:51:43,979 --> 01:51:45,180
I can evade attacks.

1447
01:51:45,739 --> 01:51:56,779
I can't even pause it because I'm gonna go off on a fucking rant right now.

1448
01:51:56,779 --> 01:51:57,579
I gotta go off on a rant.

1449
01:51:57,579 --> 01:51:58,380
Okay, I can pause it.

1450
01:51:58,380 --> 01:51:58,939
Let me...

1451
01:51:58,939 --> 01:51:59,439
Okay.

1452
01:52:00,060 --> 01:52:03,689
I understand like driving around like cars is cool

1453
01:52:03,689 --> 01:52:05,369
and like it's fun to drive around a car.

1454
01:52:05,369 --> 01:52:10,279
But are you just driving around in a circle?

1455
01:52:11,399 --> 01:52:12,600
You know, like what are you doing?

1456
01:52:13,159 --> 01:52:13,720
Like, do you...

1457
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:16,600
Okay, drive fast here.

1458
01:52:17,079 --> 01:52:23,369
But are you just driving around in a circle?

1459
01:52:24,010 --> 01:52:25,130
Like, what are you doing?

1460
01:52:25,770 --> 01:52:26,750
Like, do you...

1461
01:52:27,630 --> 01:52:29,390
Okay, drive fast here.

1462
01:52:29,630 --> 01:52:31,710
In like a four-mile circle.

1463
01:52:32,439 --> 01:52:33,239
Over and over again.

1464
01:52:35,789 --> 01:52:37,630
How many times can you do that before it's like,

1465
01:52:37,630 --> 01:52:40,350
oh, this is like I'm kind of just doing this over and over again.

1466
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,920
Stand in the road.

1467
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:53,210
Excuse me!

1468
01:52:53,210 --> 01:52:56,250
It's almost like that this is like on an NPC route.

1469
01:52:56,250 --> 01:53:05,180
That's an AI doing that.

1470
01:53:05,180 --> 01:53:07,899
Like that's like a GTA NPC.

1471
01:53:07,899 --> 01:53:09,739
It's just driving around in a circle.

1472
01:53:09,739 --> 01:53:18,090
It's just that picture of the guy standing in front of the...

1473
01:53:18,090 --> 01:53:21,399
Wait, what?

1474
01:53:21,399 --> 01:53:22,680
That's Vegas for you.

1475
01:53:22,680 --> 01:53:24,600
I understand what the fuck is happening.

1476
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:27,640
Imagine if every five minutes I just went...

1477
01:53:28,199 --> 01:53:29,239
Hey!

1478
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:30,380
Every day.

1479
01:53:31,159 --> 01:53:33,560
You know how irritating that would be for people that live in this house?

1480
01:53:36,989 --> 01:53:38,430
Okay, what's for dinner?

1481
01:53:38,430 --> 01:53:41,470
Well, we're gonna have carrots and meatloaf.

1482
01:53:41,470 --> 01:53:41,970
Hey!

1483
01:53:43,069 --> 01:53:44,350
Okay, thanks Jeremy.

1484
01:53:44,350 --> 01:53:45,789
We're gonna have carrots and meatloaf and...

1485
01:53:46,350 --> 01:53:48,720
All right, is that a chain over there?

1486
01:53:52,359 --> 01:53:53,000
No, I just...

1487
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:57,159
I run around the house and I scream when I pass people's doors.

1488
01:53:57,880 --> 01:53:59,600
All right, this looks like a chain.

1489
01:54:04,090 --> 01:54:04,649
Got it right?

1490
01:54:04,649 --> 01:54:05,149
No?

1491
01:54:05,149 --> 01:54:05,649
No?

1492
01:54:05,930 --> 01:54:06,649
Shoot the chain?

1493
01:54:16,189 --> 01:54:25,560
He's blocking.

1494
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:26,199
What about duck?

1495
01:54:27,159 --> 01:54:27,720
That didn't work.

1496
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:33,069
Pin him to the wall?

1497
01:54:34,319 --> 01:54:35,439
This is three of them, right?

1498
01:54:37,789 --> 01:54:48,920
I mean, it's hurting him.

1499
01:54:52,720 --> 01:55:00,250
Aaron needs to be charged more.

1500
01:55:01,130 --> 01:55:02,250
He has a seismic wave.

1501
01:55:03,050 --> 01:55:07,020
So let's see if I can get it.

1502
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:14,600
One, two, three, four.

1503
01:55:16,300 --> 01:55:17,340
All right, but there it is.

1504
01:55:17,340 --> 01:55:17,840
Okay.

1505
01:55:18,939 --> 01:55:20,460
One, two, three.

1506
01:55:20,460 --> 01:55:21,420
How far can he move with that?

1507
01:55:22,300 --> 01:55:28,220
Okay, again.

1508
01:55:28,220 --> 01:55:31,340
One, two, three, four, five.

1509
01:55:32,220 --> 01:55:33,420
All right, now he's held in place.

1510
01:55:34,619 --> 01:55:36,060
I can just shoot him.

1511
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:42,560
How long is he in that for?

1512
01:55:49,329 --> 01:55:50,130
Keep charging.

1513
01:55:53,170 --> 01:55:53,970
Keep charging.

1514
01:55:53,970 --> 01:55:54,470
How?

1515
01:55:54,470 --> 01:55:55,250
Really?

1516
01:55:55,250 --> 01:55:59,409
One, two, three, four, five.

1517
01:56:01,869 --> 01:56:03,310
That's a max arrow.

1518
01:56:03,310 --> 01:56:09,390
Is this Mega Man X?

1519
01:56:10,029 --> 01:56:15,199
No, I knew like the charge and how it worked,

1520
01:56:15,199 --> 01:56:18,159
but I didn't know that it had like seven levels of charge.

1521
01:56:27,470 --> 01:56:27,970
R1?

1522
01:56:28,510 --> 01:56:29,890
R1.

1523
01:56:30,430 --> 01:56:34,180
What the hell am I doing?

1524
01:56:40,020 --> 01:56:40,520
Okay.

1525
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:48,500
I call upon Zeus himself to draw the lightning.

1526
01:56:50,619 --> 01:56:54,859
This game makes no sense.

1527
01:56:55,500 --> 01:56:56,380
That was a limit break.

1528
01:57:17,250 --> 01:57:17,970
Your sentence?

1529
01:57:19,970 --> 01:57:20,770
Eternity.

1530
01:57:21,409 --> 01:57:33,039
Clover of Love.

1531
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:38,850
All right, now we're gonna go lock it back to bomb.

1532
01:57:39,649 --> 01:57:48,770
Let's save the game.

1533
01:57:49,329 --> 01:57:51,090
Just in case something really bad happens.

1534
01:57:56,859 --> 01:58:00,380
Hey, do you guys know that there's like 12 more seasons of Rick and Morty

1535
01:58:00,380 --> 01:58:01,340
that are gonna come on the way?

1536
01:58:02,770 --> 01:58:03,810
And you know that?

1537
01:58:03,810 --> 01:58:07,409
There's gonna be like 15 seasons of Rick and Morty.

1538
01:58:08,510 --> 01:58:09,310
They've already been ordered.

1539
01:58:09,310 --> 01:58:11,470
At least like nine more seasons have already been ordered.

1540
01:58:12,109 --> 01:58:13,229
So all you guys that are like,

1541
01:58:13,229 --> 01:58:14,189
I don't like Rick and Morty.

1542
01:58:16,029 --> 01:58:17,470
Got like 10 more years of this shit.

1543
01:58:18,029 --> 01:58:24,779
The bad show.

1544
01:58:29,229 --> 01:58:30,029
Auto voice.

1545
01:58:30,590 --> 01:58:31,789
Mom, I've got something for you.

1546
01:58:32,670 --> 01:58:38,989
Journal confirmed Rick and Morty.

1547
01:58:39,710 --> 01:58:43,569
I'm not like a fan of Rick and Morty.

1548
01:58:44,609 --> 01:58:50,850
Hydrate.

1549
01:58:50,850 --> 01:58:51,489
I refuse.

1550
01:59:05,340 --> 01:59:06,140
How do I know this?

1551
01:59:10,159 --> 01:59:10,960
How do I know that?

1552
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:22,500
What?

1553
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:24,800
Isn't she dead?

1554
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:34,960
This person's not rea- what?

1555
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:36,960
Yeah, this person's a ghost.

1556
01:59:38,460 --> 01:59:39,420
Why would I say that?

1557
01:59:41,199 --> 01:59:43,359
Yes, just keep playing the piano forever.

1558
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:46,880
By the way, your father's dead.

1559
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:53,020
Oh, so she can move on.

1560
01:59:53,020 --> 01:59:53,659
Oh, I get it.

1561
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:10,479
So was he the serial killer?

1562
02:00:10,479 --> 02:00:11,279
No, no, no, no, no.

1563
02:00:11,279 --> 02:00:12,640
No, he was in the war.

1564
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:12,960
Okay.

1565
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:13,199
Right.

1566
02:00:13,199 --> 02:00:15,760
No, that looks-

1567
02:00:19,149 --> 02:00:19,550
I'm not-

1568
02:00:19,550 --> 02:00:20,430
This is not fun.

1569
02:00:21,390 --> 02:00:23,069
The subject matter is not funny.

1570
02:00:23,069 --> 02:00:23,310
Okay?

1571
02:00:23,310 --> 02:00:25,229
Let me just be very clear about something.

1572
02:00:25,229 --> 02:00:25,869
The subject-

1573
02:00:33,489 --> 02:00:48,699
It's the presentation that is kind of all over the place.

1574
02:00:49,659 --> 02:00:50,859
As you can plainly see.

1575
02:00:50,859 --> 02:00:53,420
The subject matter is not like funny.

1576
02:00:54,300 --> 02:01:07,649
But the way that he was like floating up,

1577
02:01:08,369 --> 02:01:10,609
like a Teletubbies episode,

1578
02:01:10,609 --> 02:01:11,729
like what the hell was that?

1579
02:01:28,399 --> 02:01:30,000
No, it's the serial killer back again.

1580
02:01:39,439 --> 02:01:40,800
What the fuck is going on?

1581
02:01:42,159 --> 02:01:42,720
What is he-

1582
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:44,560
Help him!

1583
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:46,640
Help this guy!

1584
02:01:56,100 --> 02:01:58,100
He's looking at this weird animation.

1585
02:02:05,699 --> 02:02:09,380
Where's Harry?

1586
02:02:22,500 --> 02:02:25,619
Why is he rolling around like he's coming in bees or ants?

1587
02:02:28,260 --> 02:02:29,380
You can't go that fast.

1588
02:02:35,020 --> 02:02:37,260
That's like extreme pantomime.

1589
02:02:39,420 --> 02:02:40,539
What is happening?

1590
02:02:42,220 --> 02:02:45,180
This reminds me of like bad theater.

1591
02:02:47,819 --> 02:02:49,500
They blocked out and choreographed the scene.

1592
02:02:49,500 --> 02:02:50,859
It's just a terrible theater production.

1593
02:02:50,859 --> 02:02:51,659
It's a bad play.

1594
02:02:53,659 --> 02:02:57,760
This is fucking so stupid.

1595
02:03:03,390 --> 02:03:05,100
I'll be right back.

1596
02:03:05,100 --> 02:03:05,899
I'm gonna take a piss.

1597
02:03:05,899 --> 02:03:07,260
I'll be back in fucking two minutes.

1598
02:03:07,819 --> 02:06:49,569
Okay.

1599
02:06:50,529 --> 02:06:52,270
Let us continue.

1600
02:06:53,069 --> 02:07:00,989
This game is ridiculous.

1601
02:07:01,789 --> 02:07:07,100
So I have the key to Dick's room.

1602
02:07:07,739 --> 02:07:10,819
Is this my house?

1603
02:07:13,569 --> 02:07:14,529
I'm very confused.

1604
02:07:14,529 --> 02:07:15,649
Do I have a map of this place?

1605
02:07:18,100 --> 02:07:18,979
Wrong button.

1606
02:07:19,539 --> 02:07:24,270
I just got here.

1607
02:07:24,270 --> 02:07:26,029
When does he play Apex Legends?

1608
02:07:29,680 --> 02:07:30,960
Apex Legends.

1609
02:07:36,239 --> 02:07:38,000
The door has been boarded up.

1610
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:41,010
Wait, why do I still need to do this?

1611
02:07:41,810 --> 02:07:46,899
Why would you put a spell on the bathroom?

1612
02:07:53,340 --> 02:07:54,300
That's next level.

1613
02:07:54,300 --> 02:07:55,340
Don't go in there.

1614
02:07:55,340 --> 02:07:57,180
You took like such a big dump in here.

1615
02:07:57,979 --> 02:08:00,460
That you really don't want somebody to go in.

1616
02:08:01,409 --> 02:08:02,529
The dead body in here.

1617
02:08:03,600 --> 02:08:04,880
One of the lodges view.

1618
02:08:04,880 --> 02:08:05,600
What a stink.

1619
02:08:16,989 --> 02:08:17,869
Get off me, please.

1620
02:08:24,140 --> 02:08:25,020
Nancy.

1621
02:08:25,020 --> 02:08:26,140
I'm gonna go to Dick's room.

1622
02:08:30,939 --> 02:08:33,180
The three-way mirror has been folded up.

1623
02:08:33,899 --> 02:08:36,539
What else you got here?

1624
02:08:39,180 --> 02:08:40,220
What a dumb painting.

1625
02:08:40,859 --> 02:08:42,819
What was wrong with the first one?

1626
02:08:48,909 --> 02:08:49,310
All right.

1627
02:08:49,310 --> 02:08:52,189
So there's another painting stuck under the first one.

1628
02:08:53,250 --> 02:08:54,449
This one has a clock on it.

1629
02:08:55,170 --> 02:08:56,689
And it is at 3 p.m.

1630
02:08:57,409 --> 02:09:02,859
Throw that one in the trash.

1631
02:09:02,859 --> 02:09:03,500
Why is this here?

1632
02:09:03,500 --> 02:09:03,739
All right.

1633
02:09:03,739 --> 02:09:04,300
3 p.m.

1634
02:09:04,859 --> 02:09:05,659
Is that 3 p.m.

1635
02:09:05,659 --> 02:09:08,350
Or is that 12 15?

1636
02:09:08,989 --> 02:09:16,109
Well, it's either 3 or 12 15.

1637
02:09:16,670 --> 02:09:17,630
This is Mum's bed.

1638
02:09:18,350 --> 02:09:23,310
All right.

1639
02:09:23,310 --> 02:09:24,189
Well, now we have a...

1640
02:09:24,189 --> 02:09:24,829
Well, here you go.

1641
02:09:25,470 --> 02:09:26,989
The clock has stopped ticking.

1642
02:09:26,989 --> 02:09:29,789
You'll need a special winding key to get it working again.

1643
02:09:30,670 --> 02:09:31,550
Of course I do.

1644
02:09:35,859 --> 02:09:37,060
Mom had a lot of shit, huh?

1645
02:09:38,100 --> 02:09:39,699
This desk is in such a dumb place.

1646
02:09:40,420 --> 02:09:42,260
What is the feng shui in here?

1647
02:09:42,579 --> 02:09:44,260
You might have a desk in the middle of your room.

1648
02:09:45,300 --> 02:09:45,939
Two desks.

1649
02:09:46,500 --> 02:09:49,260
What a sloppy...

1650
02:09:49,260 --> 02:09:50,220
Look at this nightstand.

1651
02:09:50,220 --> 02:09:51,100
Why is a bed here?

1652
02:09:57,329 --> 02:10:02,510
I would appreciate it if you didn't change the camera on me.

1653
02:10:02,510 --> 02:10:03,710
There's a computer on the desk.

1654
02:10:03,710 --> 02:10:04,670
I wish I had one too.

1655
02:10:06,539 --> 02:10:06,939
What's this?

1656
02:10:06,939 --> 02:10:07,420
I'm gonna sneeze.

1657
02:10:09,220 --> 02:10:10,100
Oh, I couldn't get it.

1658
02:10:10,100 --> 02:10:10,420
I'm sorry.

1659
02:10:11,300 --> 02:10:12,960
It just happens sometimes.

1660
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:13,520
I couldn't do it.

1661
02:10:15,899 --> 02:10:16,619
Okay.

1662
02:10:16,619 --> 02:10:21,069
Nothing else.

1663
02:10:21,630 --> 02:10:22,960
I have Dick's key.

1664
02:10:26,750 --> 02:10:28,109
Mum must know what's going on.

1665
02:10:29,229 --> 02:10:30,270
Where is Mum?

1666
02:10:30,270 --> 02:10:32,050
Must have left in a hurry.

1667
02:10:32,050 --> 02:10:33,090
The wardrobe is still open.

1668
02:10:39,100 --> 02:10:39,739
Why is there a ghost?

1669
02:10:39,739 --> 02:10:41,100
Is that Mum in the bathtub?

1670
02:10:41,899 --> 02:10:43,180
I don't know who is that.

1671
02:10:50,270 --> 02:10:51,869
Why is it just a ghost in the house?

1672
02:10:52,430 --> 02:11:00,319
All right, we need to find Dick's room.

1673
02:11:00,880 --> 02:11:04,560
Let me look at the map again.

1674
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:06,739
Do I have a legend or anything?

1675
02:11:10,020 --> 02:11:14,100
Is there a way I can get to the appendix of this legend?

1676
02:11:14,100 --> 02:11:15,060
Of this map?

1677
02:11:15,060 --> 02:11:15,699
Get to the legend.

1678
02:11:18,100 --> 02:11:18,899
Looking for the append...

1679
02:11:18,899 --> 02:11:21,140
Oh, apex legend is what I'm looking for.

1680
02:11:25,119 --> 02:11:25,439
Don't.

1681
02:11:26,159 --> 02:11:27,039
Don't do it.

1682
02:11:30,399 --> 02:11:30,720
Don't.

1683
02:11:32,369 --> 02:11:33,569
Couldn't I crawl through here before?

1684
02:11:37,920 --> 02:11:38,800
Don't.

1685
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:43,649
This is Alyssa's room.

1686
02:11:43,649 --> 02:11:44,369
Is he still in here?

1687
02:11:48,510 --> 02:11:50,270
It's as if that nightmare never took place.

1688
02:11:50,829 --> 02:11:56,500
Wait, what's across the way?

1689
02:11:56,500 --> 02:11:56,979
Is that Dick?

1690
02:12:05,140 --> 02:12:07,539
Is this going to be a clock tower stream?

1691
02:12:08,260 --> 02:12:11,199
Nothing of interest here.

1692
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:12,829
Who is it?

1693
02:12:12,829 --> 02:12:13,149
Philip?

1694
02:12:13,789 --> 02:12:14,189
Damn it.

1695
02:12:18,260 --> 02:12:18,659
I don't know.

1696
02:12:18,659 --> 02:12:20,180
I'm just kind of playing it.

1697
02:12:20,989 --> 02:12:22,989
I knew I was going to play this for at least a couple hours.

1698
02:12:22,989 --> 02:12:27,060
I knew it just by the first 20 minutes.

1699
02:12:27,619 --> 02:12:28,899
Well, let's just save it at least.

1700
02:12:29,460 --> 02:12:37,199
And as it happens, sometimes you get locked in one.

1701
02:12:43,090 --> 02:12:44,770
I was promised 12 hours.

1702
02:12:44,770 --> 02:12:47,970
No, one of these games has a 12-hour timer on it.

1703
02:12:48,909 --> 02:12:50,350
And I don't know what to do with it.

1704
02:12:51,420 --> 02:12:52,859
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with it.

1705
02:12:53,420 --> 02:12:59,949
I need to find the right moment to play that game.

1706
02:13:01,949 --> 02:13:02,829
Where's Dick's room?

1707
02:13:10,659 --> 02:13:11,779
Filled with art and antiques.

1708
02:13:11,779 --> 02:13:13,140
Grandpa used to collect these things.

1709
02:13:13,140 --> 02:13:13,380
Right.

1710
02:13:13,939 --> 02:13:16,779
It's locked.

1711
02:13:16,779 --> 02:13:17,979
The lodges won't be coming back.

1712
02:13:17,979 --> 02:13:18,539
All right.

1713
02:13:18,539 --> 02:13:19,739
I need to find this room.

1714
02:13:25,060 --> 02:13:26,850
Well, that was a random find.

1715
02:13:27,970 --> 02:13:30,500
He didn't even have a label on his door.

1716
02:13:31,579 --> 02:13:33,500
Your room is really, really weird too.

1717
02:13:36,590 --> 02:13:37,470
All these old books.

1718
02:13:37,470 --> 02:13:38,590
What was he studying?

1719
02:13:41,619 --> 02:13:42,500
Dog magics.

1720
02:13:43,060 --> 02:13:47,380
All right.

1721
02:13:47,380 --> 02:13:54,689
If you got this many books, it might be time to donate some of them.

1722
02:13:54,689 --> 02:13:56,210
There is a scribbled note.

1723
02:13:56,210 --> 02:14:00,210
The keys to the mystery of time lie behind you.

1724
02:14:00,930 --> 02:14:05,939
What a stupid note.

1725
02:14:05,939 --> 02:14:07,899
Book of Entities 1.

1726
02:14:09,819 --> 02:14:13,180
Entities have existed in the human realm since Roman days.

1727
02:14:13,979 --> 02:14:18,619
These beings have been known to possess innocent humans, imbuing them with

1728
02:14:18,619 --> 02:14:23,979
utter ruthlessness and cruelty and often driving the possessed to vicious acts of murder.

1729
02:14:24,779 --> 02:14:29,659
In such cases, executing the murderer does not break the circle of evil.

1730
02:14:29,659 --> 02:14:33,579
The possessed is resurrected to continue its bloodthirsty mission.

1731
02:14:34,899 --> 02:14:37,859
Those who are thus controlled by entities are known as

1732
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:41,279
sub, uh, apex legends.

1733
02:14:42,079 --> 02:14:47,300
When a subordinate kills a human, they take nourishment from the victim's soul

1734
02:14:48,020 --> 02:14:49,380
and their power grows.

1735
02:14:50,100 --> 02:14:53,979
Subordinates may acquire an infinite amount of power in this manner.

1736
02:14:53,979 --> 02:14:58,140
It follows then that subordinates are sustained by human misery and suffering.

1737
02:14:59,329 --> 02:15:02,850
Only certain humans are equipped to fight entities and their subordinates,

1738
02:15:03,409 --> 02:15:10,449
the Rooters, who are always young women in their teens,

1739
02:15:11,090 --> 02:15:14,449
have been battling against these shadowy enemies for hundreds of years.

1740
02:15:15,090 --> 02:15:18,449
Their war is likely to continue for many centuries to come.

1741
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:20,560
Yes it does.

1742
02:15:20,560 --> 02:15:22,130
Yes it will.

1743
02:15:22,130 --> 02:15:26,689
Considering the amount of 500 years in the future after this game takes place,

1744
02:15:27,329 --> 02:15:33,170
animes with the same exact plot as this game.

1745
02:15:46,140 --> 02:15:46,619
Serpents!

1746
02:15:49,579 --> 02:15:52,779
Dude I'm thinking about getting that as like a tat like the serpent eating its own serpent.

1747
02:16:13,409 --> 02:16:15,250
Why the fuck are you dressed like Freddy Krueger?

1748
02:16:44,510 --> 02:16:46,030
Is this our new contact?

1749
02:16:58,610 --> 02:16:59,569
There they are again.

1750
02:16:59,569 --> 02:17:01,090
Yep, has it been 10 minutes?

1751
02:17:01,250 --> 02:17:17,260
All of a sudden a bunch of like fucking Chili's employees come out and they're like

1752
02:17:18,059 --> 02:17:24,459
happy birthday to you happy birthday and they bring a shitty cupcake with one candle in it.

1753
02:17:24,459 --> 02:17:39,379
He went out really fast, loony tunes fast.

1754
02:17:41,420 --> 02:17:46,079
Okay a scribbled note yeah the keys to the mystery of time lie behind you so

1755
02:17:46,079 --> 02:17:55,790
over here these old books what was he studying something in the chair in his chair I went to

1756
02:17:55,790 --> 02:18:02,750
a place that charged us for the birthday thing see what you have to do is you go with you know

1757
02:18:02,750 --> 02:18:09,219
you want you want to do like oh hey like oh funny prank get like 15 people to go as groups

1758
02:18:09,219 --> 02:18:15,760
of like two in different places in the restaurant and it's everybody's birthday today

1759
02:18:15,760 --> 02:18:19,360
so they have to go around and do the birthday thing to like 15 different parties

1760
02:18:21,520 --> 02:18:26,159
and like you tip them a fucking you tip them like fucking 500 bucks after that by the way

1761
02:18:44,020 --> 02:18:55,149
I would fucking hate you if you did that you don't do that money does not forgive your sins

1762
02:18:55,870 --> 02:19:17,469
if you tipped me 150 dollars I would spill boiling soup on your lap why wait hold on

1763
02:19:17,469 --> 02:19:23,229

purified with holy water until it has been sufficiently charged with energy for full effect

1813
02:29:18,620 --> 02:29:24,780
only when the square is infused with light may the practitioner expect any ground-breaking

1814
02:29:24,780 --> 02:29:29,969
results so you need to do holy water and charge it portal squares need to be purified

1928
02:53:21,940 --> 02:53:30,590

1934
02:54:43,440 --> 02:54:54,129

1935
02:54:54,850 --> 02:54:59,870
and they're all on screen in the same time you have to do seven cgi frame by frame face

1936

1939
02:55:30,829 --> 02:55:38,270

02:56:23,680 --> 02:56:30,399
gear but hasn't been your day your week your month or even your year

1944

put the dick in the key put the key in the deck whatever it's called book of entities too

1945
02:56:43,219 --> 02:56:48,579
in order to defeat a subordinate the murdered soul which acts as its energy source must be

1946
02:56:48,579 --> 02:56:54,500
healed to investigate the healing process a sentimental item belonging to that person

1947
02:56:54,579 --> 02:56:59,940
must be obtained if it would be able to and when this item has been found

1948
02:56:59,940 --> 02:57:06,260
the router power is boosted temporarily when we find that router we'll find the portal square

1949
02:57:06,260 --> 02:57:20,670
it appears what do i do a person must be a tow for a thief uh bomb just it's happening

1950
02:57:20,670 --> 02:57:26,620
again must be obtained if when the item has been found the router power is boosted

1951
02:57:31,040 --> 02:57:38,159
and this oh grandpa was the guy in the mask the guy in the beginning of the game

1952
02:57:38,719 --> 02:57:50,319

1978 february 2nd

1961
02:59:20,260 --> 02:59:29,120
entities are scattered all over europe we the hamiltons are also of this lineage i am proud

1962
02:59:29,120 --> 02:59:44,799
rudablood is passed down to pete francesca was a group of my naive youth entities preferring

1963
02:59:44,799 --> 02:59:53,100
to believe that it was all just an old wife's tale i found the book and she began to sharpen

1964
02:59:53,100 --> 03:00:00,180
her wound finally opened my eyes to the truth began this is the kingdom hearts three

1965
03:00:00,180 --> 03:00:05,739
scenario right kingdom hearts one comes out king hearts two comes out and then they the

1966
03:00:05,739 --> 03:00:11,180
story just goes fucking crazy and they have to tie up a million lucents clock tower one

1967
03:00:13,500 --> 03:00:20,420
you were just scared getting chased by a guy why do we have to progressively get fucking weirder

1968
03:00:20,420 --> 03:00:54,340
disappearing in time generations spent their team duration coming of which well is a responsibility

1969
03:00:54,340 --> 03:01:12,190
that must be taken very seriously sadly another ruder have been hamilton household

1970
03:01:12,190 --> 03:01:20,799
first grandchild i chose for her the name alice she is bright and light perhaps even a little

1971
03:01:20,799 --> 03:01:29,600
strong will yet appears somehow wide beyond the praise she will grow strong and help will

1972
03:01:29,600 --> 03:01:36,989
fulfill her obligation as a noble sorry grandpa i don't think i want to do that i'm going home

1973
03:01:41,260 --> 03:01:53,860
a ruder family that's me so i am a ruder it's in my blood now maybe you should start not being

1974
03:01:53,860 --> 03:02:00,500

1975
03:02:00,500 --> 03:02:06,659

you've been on this game for three hours i'm interested well not not anymore but i was

1981
03:03:10,579 --> 03:03:17,950
up until we got to the plot of 48 of every animated show it was interesting

1982
03:03:18,670 --> 03:03:32,610
probably more than that remember there's nothing to be interested about flush it i can't yet not

1983
03:03:32,610 --> 03:03:38,909
yet wait once we put the film in the canister that is my like last will and testament as a

1990
03:05:07,659 --> 03:05:19,579
promised 12 hours of ed ed and eddie and the game is probably terrible it's not like simpson's

1991
03:05:19,579 --> 03:05:24,620
hit and run well that's a game that i wanted to beat even though i hated every second of

1992
03:05:24,620 --> 03:05:37,520
it it still was an enjoyable sort of experience kind of now let's put the film in the

2066
03:23:32,139 --> 03:23:42,719
correct one there's two boards probably this one time to play the guessing game which one's

2321
04:34:00,110 --> 04:34:21,360
oh yeah okay power the way down flip the switch now i have to go back key card reader

2322
04:34:21,360 --> 04:34:25,040
which is where i don't remember i think the power is flowing

2323
04:34:55,180 --> 04:35:14,060
same floor i need chat to confirm that would be right now same floor it worked i think the

2324
04:35:14,060 --> 04:35:42,560
power is flowing yes so go so open the door uh oh where's the key card

2325
04:36:17,009 --> 04:36:20,529
maybe i don't have to activate something here maybe i have to do the thing where i

2326
04:36:20,529 --> 04:36:30,740
burn them something else in here i guess i should activate this i'm just gonna catch

2327

oh nice trick we know how this is

2328
04:36:55,139 --> 04:36:58,580

for you i know you're streaming so i'll keep the question fast and simple i don't want to

2357
04:43:54,669 --> 04:43:59,869
be a bother although the larger spectrum of things this is time is quite minimal universe

regardless thanks for answering ahead of time what are you talking about maybe one day i can

2360
04:44:11,439 --> 04:44:17,040
ask a more in-depth personal human question for my good friends i don't these don't make any

2361
04:44:17,040 --> 04:44:36,299
sense like 60 000 years ago the guy a guy who like wrote the bible you know what we're

2362
04:44:36,299 --> 04:44:58,669
gonna leave behind hey it's jeff from psychology 101 that's gonna be our generation's bible i hope

2363
04:44:58,669 --> 04:45:09,330
so oh it's been just been five hours and i've been i've been driving in circles for five hours

2370
04:46:40,299 --> 04:46:47,340
us a repellent arrow that's one of the bunnies from castle griffinstein so it's kind of odd

2392

prison 921 years sentenced your health bar is enormous judgment begin welcome he's doing some

2394
04:52:26,340 --> 04:52:32,799
cool tricks speaking of nice trick you can't get away

2395
04:52:33,040 --> 04:52:45,419
oh

2396
04:52:57,020 --> 04:52:59,419
you can't get away

2397
04:53:05,580 --> 04:53:13,569
so

2398
04:53:17,169 --> 04:53:29,259

2399
04:53:29,259 --> 04:54:05,009
rest on magical bow no that was weird we didn't get the piece just an excuse to reuse him in

2400
04:54:05,009 --> 04:54:22,819
the next chapter that's probably what it is you'd be correct i would assume hey nice trick devs

2401
04:54:28,369 --> 04:54:40,369
the scroll that i just picked up 1998 may 12 my sweet elisa my sweet elisa you do a small

2402
04:54:40,369 --> 04:54:50,299
hands have grasped my heart and will not let go to think of the frizz it is more than i

2403
04:54:50,299 --> 04:54:57,340
can bear i consented to the marriage so as to protect the rudder bloodline i realize now that

2404
04:54:57,340 --> 04:55:04,750
was a foolish mistake and lacks class and has not a shred of dignity he loses no opportunity

2405
04:55:04,750 --> 04:55:14,430
to exhibit his stupidity and weakness of character even nancy has been affected by his

2406
04:55:14,430 --> 04:55:20,259
rubbish saying that she does not want to raise elisa to be a rudder of course the existence

2407
04:55:20,259 --> 04:55:26,020
of a rudder is fraught with danger but given the gravity of the situation and the great

2408
04:55:26,020 --> 04:55:33,459
responsibility of a rudder family the obligation cannot be shirked any attempt to avoid such a

2409
04:55:33,459 --> 04:55:41,099
duty is indeed shameful as long as i am the head of this house that man will never be accepted

2410
04:55:41,099 --> 04:55:52,020
as one of us no date finally philip went too far i could no longer allow him to large gap

2411
04:55:52,020 --> 04:56:03,650
there that headstrong act has turned me into a vile murder my secret to the cannot allow

2412
04:56:03,650 --> 04:56:11,150
Hamilton legacy to be disrupted there is nothing to be done but handle the police carefully

2413
04:56:11,790 --> 04:56:19,180
and tread with the utmost caution there's police in this universe i feel like they don't

2414
04:56:19,180 --> 04:56:35,180
there isn't now the cops are involved there's my magical rudder bloodline and monsters and

2415
04:56:35,180 --> 04:56:42,540
kratos's and all the fucked up magic that we have in this world bow and arrows made out of jewels

2416
04:56:44,290 --> 04:56:54,880
police yeah just dialed 911 to see if we could get them to come investigate is this one of

2417
04:56:54,880 --> 04:57:08,349
those things it's the magical police no it's not the magical police it's going to be like

2424
04:59:26,479 --> 04:59:35,330
it's pretty good i was killed by an entity and have been trapped in the darkness ever since

2425

from me and the entities used it to perform the ritual of engagement wait what is the ritual

2428

of engagement tell me tell me what's going on this game sucks

2469
05:10:18,720 --> 05:10:24,639
muted because it's it's a piercing ear sound that is at a very high frequency

2536
05:25:28,290 --> 05:25:34,830

2539
05:25:57,869 --> 05:26:01,310
that that's the third one to press let's just see if i may let's see if it works

2543
05:27:04,029 --> 05:27:09,340

where do i bring the two compasses back to the courtyard the front courtyard there

2560
05:31:12,479 --> 05:31:31,680

2572
05:33:43,810 --> 05:33:54,500

2573
05:33:54,500 --> 05:34:04,349
enemy for the rest of the game can't we get like the the mayor from nightmare before

2574
05:34:04,349 --> 05:34:29,419
christmas to come back i made it up maybe something scary something scary something scary

2575
05:34:29,419 --> 05:34:39,540
something scary something scary something scary i think so maybe that was an interesting angle

2576
05:34:39,540 --> 05:34:49,549
to not have anything scary this is a binding arrow i don't have they didn't teach me how to

2577
05:34:49,549 --> 05:35:07,389
use that the only clock tower in the game is in the save menu i think technically we're inside

2578
05:35:07,389 --> 05:35:11,470
of the clock tower

2579
05:35:29,619 --> 05:35:32,959
what that's why they're talking about my heart

2580
05:35:33,919 --> 05:35:40,700
but who who wants to drink my blood to become an entity who would do this

2581
05:35:41,740 --> 05:35:55,740

use them all thank god anything else in here is that nothing else what about in the sink

2758
06:29:52,369 --> 06:30:11,569
nothing all right let's see where this takes us get the fuck off this game and play red

2759
06:30:11,569 --> 06:30:18,000
dead redemption 2 i already beat red dead redemption 2 i didn't beat it on stream i

2760
06:30:18,000 --> 06:30:29,409
beat it off stream play red dead 2 get out of this game i've used that exact lightning

2761
06:30:29,409 --> 06:30:38,560
sound effect actually i've used it on christmas the train and the train goes over the tracks and

2762
06:30:38,560 --> 06:30:54,880
gets the lightning strike thing what the hell is this that's grandpa right

2763
06:31:18,419 --> 06:31:26,299
play every game ever on stream very hard to do we're gonna get a narration here i think

2764
06:31:27,020 --> 06:31:36,700
today is yep i knew it the powers will become visible see you guys when you

2765
06:31:36,700 --> 06:31:42,430
wake up in like 10 minutes lisa is growing up into a lovely young lady she is everything to me

2766
06:31:42,430 --> 06:31:52,080
and i wish for nothing more than to watch over her every step she takes towards adulthood

2767
06:31:52,080 --> 06:32:00,400
is a step away from you i want so much to be with her i can't mute the music it's impossible

2768
06:32:02,659 --> 06:32:09,459
i have stumbled across an account of a ceremony called the ritual of engagement

2769
06:32:10,419 --> 06:32:12,500
it is written the bio didn't we already hear this

2770
06:32:13,380 --> 06:32:19,520
on her 15th birthday and drinking her blood person can be transformed into an entity

2771
06:32:20,080 --> 06:32:29,060
and receive the gift of immortality disgusted by this ritual of course at the same time there

2772
06:32:29,060 --> 06:32:35,180
is a part of me that cannot resist its allure i tore out alice's heart with these hands and

2773
06:32:35,180 --> 06:32:43,630
partook of her blood her for all eternity capable of such a monstrosity

2774
06:32:44,349 --> 06:32:50,029
must i desecrate my beloved in order to save myself so he's yeah he's gonna do it

2775
06:32:51,779 --> 06:32:59,740
yet another amazing discovery the legend of lord boris in the document is a mysterious

2776
06:32:59,740 --> 06:33:05,779
triangular crest it is said that the one who is able to decipher the secrets of the crest

2777
06:33:06,419 --> 06:33:13,060
will be able to become an entity i suspect that this too is related to the ritual of engagement

2778
06:33:14,180 --> 06:33:14,900
i can't skip this

2779
06:33:22,720 --> 06:33:26,319
uh alissa dennis and uh nancy whatever our names are

2780
06:33:27,119 --> 06:33:36,880
let's figure out the end of the game non-disclosure agreement i don't understand

2781
06:33:36,880 --> 06:33:42,189
he's just reading off like a concept for an rpg he like got invited to the blizzard

2782
06:33:42,189 --> 06:34:10,110
headquarters or something same point the nda i don't understand what it means i just see all

2783
06:34:10,110 --> 06:34:14,270
this weird shit about demons and monsters and drinking people's blood

2784
06:34:15,470 --> 06:34:24,209
and also somehow down here mentioned something called loot boxes which is surprising to me but

2785
06:34:24,209 --> 06:34:28,290
i've never really seen that term before in a 60 dollar game it's very interesting

2786
06:34:29,650 --> 06:34:32,779
what are you doing here what are you doing here what the fuck

2787
06:34:41,340 --> 06:34:54,259
uh good thing i just saved it she's mocking me i couldn't move i couldn't fucking move

2788
06:34:54,979 --> 06:35:17,409
i hope she's okay okay it's a good thing i saved really

2789
06:35:18,540 --> 06:35:23,939
that would have been pretty bad seriously jerma i could beat that

2790
06:35:28,590 --> 06:35:32,979
let's take care of that right off the bat because now we can predict it

2791

2794
06:36:08,909 --> 06:36:14,110
me that's an organ an organ is just a giant piano made out of tubes i thought that was

2795
06:36:14,110 --> 06:36:20,770
a sexual thing right there i thought these are all i all these good i

2796
06:36:32,240 --> 06:36:48,270

the amount of dexterity it takes to do what this person is doing

2800
06:37:47,779 --> 06:38:06,349
that's the hardest beat saber level i think i've ever seen i don't know if this is the

2911
07:12:40,349 --> 07:12:48,450
gave her all of his land when he's 50 he was afraid of his life he learned about the entities

2912
07:12:48,450 --> 07:12:53,330
and the rituals uh his daughter was turning almost 15 years old he made the fateful decision

2913
07:12:53,330 --> 07:12:59,650
to perform the ritual he ate her heart something's happened right before her 15th birthday

she died uh we're in a carriage she was enrolled into its side shocked that she died

2915
07:13:05,169 --> 07:13:09,009
by his beloved daughter as well as the inability to realize the ritual fell into a deep

2916
07:13:09,009 --> 07:13:16,130
depression uh he was replaced with raging anger he's really mad though he had both the coachman

07:13:21,490 --> 07:13:26,290
anger the massacre of his staff continued even extending to the villages and lands

2919
07:13:26,930 --> 07:13:31,409
the his wife did what she could to convince him to cut it out don't do that but only

2920

serial killers fascination for blades and in particular scissors they found endless enjoyment

2985
07:30:42,209 --> 07:30:47,680
in gutting or dismembering people when lord borough's was killed ralph and jemima

2986

were stoned to death by the crowds they resurrected together and they continued to wreck havoc

2987

3141
08:22:28,849 --> 08:22:32,610
warcraft boss you just have to do everything over and over again for like 10 minutes

3142

oh my god elissa takes strikes from me phase two

3145
08:23:29,520 --> 08:23:49,490
is the game broken why are we getting the opening cut scene in the game

3146
08:23:50,369 --> 08:24:07,139

3147
08:24:28,419 --> 08:24:52,720
passes denis on the way down and so ends clock towers is there another clock tower game

3148
08:24:52,720 --> 08:25:25,580
after this it can't be right the whole tower comes down who cares there are some spiritual

3149
08:25:25,580 --> 08:25:53,020
successors okay we didn't have time to mourn ron it was all a dream how satisfied are you

3150
08:25:53,020 --> 08:26:01,869
right now i'm pretty satisfied i stuck to my guns and i completed clock tower three i didn't

3151
08:26:01,869 --> 08:26:08,509
think i was gonna do that after the second boss i was about to stop but i feel accomplished

3152
08:26:10,959 --> 08:26:37,250
in a not at all sort of way mom we did it we did it mom am i dead what did we do

3153
08:26:37,889 --> 08:26:46,099
we did it i think we're in all we all made it to heaven

3154
08:26:46,099 --> 08:27:13,659
he got one out of 18 endings where would the other endings come from ron didn't make it

3155
08:27:13,659 --> 08:27:17,419
to heaven that's actually kind of unfortunate that's really bad

3156
08:27:24,209 --> 08:27:50,930
that's so wrong the main character of the next game she didn't really seem to miss him she

3157
08:27:50,930 --> 08:27:56,619
didn't even know he was gone ron was the reason why we were able to even win in the first

3158
08:27:56,619 --> 08:28:04,189
place he threw the magical lucky charm up at me without ron there is no win you don't win

3159
08:28:04,990 --> 08:28:27,090
i was supposed to get sacrificed to take the demon god library program all right let's see is

3160
08:28:27,090 --> 08:29:04,110
there a after credit scene original concept movie product what movie why didn't you just

3161
08:29:04,110 --> 08:29:07,549
leave in the beginning and he wouldn't have been able to become the entity either way

3162
08:29:07,549 --> 08:29:21,919
since you would not be there for the sacrifice yeah clock tower three received mixed or average

3163
08:29:21,919 --> 08:29:37,810
reviews with an aggregate score of 69 out of 100 it was still enjoyable all right look the game

3164
08:29:37,810 --> 08:29:46,590
was all over the place but it was still it was a it was messy fun it was messy fun no it was

3165
08:29:46,590 --> 08:30:04,830

3255
08:45:01,200 --> 08:45:11,229
you d jack thank you uh we had 250 coming from nate again when i played the orange box on my

3256
08:45:11,229 --> 08:45:16,500
ps3 i don't even think it works does does tf2 still even have servers on the orange box

3257
08:45:17,060 --> 08:45:28,130
for like playstation the server is still up isn't this still like a crit bug in the game

3258
08:45:28,130 --> 08:45:35,700
that hasn't been patched since like 2008 can't you charge up a melee crit in the

3259
08:45:35,700 --> 08:45:43,860
orange box version on the console there's still a bunch of old vanilla bugs

3260
08:45:46,220 --> 08:45:49,819
but i played thousands and thousands and thousands of hours of the orange box

3261
08:45:50,380 --> 08:45:55,490
i will probably not be going back and playing it anytime soon or probably you know probably

3262
08:45:55,490 --> 08:46:02,020
never again unless there's some reason why i would play portal again i've beat that game

3263
08:46:02,020 --> 08:46:08,580
like three times half-life 2 i've that that game i'm not going to go back to tf2 i mean

3264
08:46:08,580 --> 08:46:12,659
it's still there it's still available i don't have like a reason to go back and play it

3265
08:46:13,630 --> 08:46:18,830
but if they do something cool or bigger or larger add some interesting things i played it like a

3266
08:46:18,830 --> 08:46:24,830
year and a half ago but i don't really have a reason to play them like i've already done all

3267
08:46:24,830 --> 08:46:31,549
these things more than once so going back and doing it again is just like hey i'm doing it

3268
08:46:31,549 --> 08:46:38,799
again because i don't really have a reason to do it especially something like portal or half

3269
08:46:38,799 --> 08:46:48,849
life so would not be playing those games probably again uh thank you the other us for
