1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:10,740
Hey, how's everybody doing? Early today. Very early. I wasn't anticipating being this early, but

2
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:23,269
sometimes things happen and you have to solve them. Uh, Otto has an appointment today. He has some

3
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:30,390
like kind of weird skin itching issues and it's getting to the point where it's been like a

4
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,429
couple days and I really I gotta get him in to get seen. So he's okay. He's fine. There's

5
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:40,149
nothing wrong with him. He's just, I don't know if it's the dry Vegas air or something or the

6
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:45,990
Vegas weather or something, but he needs to, I gotta get him checked out. So, um, gonna start

7
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:51,509
early. Stream for about five hours or so. Me and Ster are gonna play Deep Rock Galactic.

8
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:58,759
It is a left for dead Minecraft game. That's right. It's a lot. I don't know what this

9
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:03,000
game actually is. I did the tutorial and we're in a lobby together right now. Uh,

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,780
italics may join us in like an hour or so and we'll go for about four or five hours and then

11
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,519
I gotta take Otto to the vet and then tomorrow we're gonna do the movies. So you'll see the

12
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:25,049
movies tomorrow. Hopefully with some, uh, mods installed and that's the plan. So let me see if

13
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:44,359
he's, uh, here. You there? I'm not sure if he's around yet. Hey, I don't, I really don't

14
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:56,870
want to raise my voice. I will if I have to. I think he's got me muted. Let me move

15
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:06,920
this out of the way. Okay. Hey look. So this is, uh, Deep Rock Galactic. This is the

16
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:25,379
lobby system and there is, um, let's see if we can get his attention. How do I, like,

17
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:48,939
how do I get his attention? Did I just spit on him? Oh, hello. Hey there. Yeah, I'm here.

18
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:53,590
Hey, sorry. I was trying to, like, get your attention. Oh, I accidentally had to turn down.

19
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:03,050
Well, that was kind of funny. Um, so what, what's the, uh, where do we go? What's the

20
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:12,490
plan? I think you might be lagging a little. Yeah, I'm lagging. Uh, you go to the mission

21
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:19,340
terminal. Yeah. And you select the mission. Well, you're the party leader so I think you

22
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:24,360
should do it first. Because I really don't, I don't know how, like, where to go.

23
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:33,210
I mean, either. I haven't played in a while. Yeah. Um, what's that? That looks like a,

24
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:40,810
uh, looks like my old intro up there. That's pretty funny. Yeah. It's, like,

25
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:47,509
kind of funny. Yeah. What, so what, what's the first mission? What we

26
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:54,860
countdown? All right, come. We're doing the, uh, do you have to strap in?

27
00:03:55,819 --> 00:04:09,719
Yeah, you gotta strap in. Remember seatbelt. He reminds you. Uh, pretty good game so far.

28
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,540
What was, sorry, I was panicking. What'd you say? I was just having, you know,

29
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:28,220
sorry. No, you, you talk first. I, I talk, what? Oh, wait, no, sorry. I thought I was

30
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:34,259
talking over you. All right. So I'm playing as the, um, I, I'm playing as the, what's this,

31
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:39,939
the driller? How do I get my drill out? And you try your, your one or your two or your three or

32
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:44,259
your four. So I can't explain how this game works because I can't really do that good of

33
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:55,689
a job explaining it so you can do it. Um, listen to him. That goes down pretty far.

34
00:04:55,689 --> 00:05:00,009
You go down through the tunnels, you find the resources we need. So we've got to extract 200

35
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:04,649
more kite. You've got to collect 10 fossils. That's a, that's what we got to do. And then

36
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:09,930
you got to come run all the way back up to this spot before the ship leaves. All right. Nice.

37
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:19,000
And I'm the light guy. Also there's all damage and you don't want to, you don't want to take

38
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,899
that. And usually in the starting area, you know, you got a couple of things to mind.

39
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:33,430
That's our bot. You got to put the minerals in the bot. You know, not that pretty good.

40
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,800
Oops. I, or are you just hanging out here?

41
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,660
You're going to get out of it. Help me. You're going to get out of it. Help me. Come on.

42
00:05:52,660 --> 00:06:03,339
It's German star again. Let's go. That's it. Last long. I can't, I can't do that. I can't,

43
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,740
I can't. I'm sorry. That's not going to happen. We agreed to try and sound as boring

44
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:15,860
as possible and see how long we could do it, but there was a cliff. Hey, hey, hey,

45
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:21,540
turn around tutorial. I don't even know how to play the game. I'm teaching you. This is the,

46
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:26,740
this is the fossil. That's awesome. We need 10 of those. Why don't I get my little, uh,

47
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,660
bot? Oh, well I have to do, we don't have the bot, the bot is single player. So it's,

48
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:36,100
it's up to us. It's up to us. Well, I've got a flame thrower. That's pretty cool. How

49
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:41,300
do I get my, um, Ooh, I got my drill arms. How do I? Okay. I'm not, I'm not,

50
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,100
I'm actually not trying to fall on purpose. Like what's my travel ability?

51
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:51,480
I don't think the drill guy has one, but you can, you, you ever played red faction?

52
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:59,050
Yeah. That's what we're talking about. You just drill up and down. Oh, okay. That's somewhere.

53
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:04,009
If we had more people, like if we had any friends whatsoever, if I didn't like break

54
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:09,290
all ties with everybody and we would have other people be able to join us, then there's like a

55
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:16,629
zip line guy. Yeah. It's just too bad you've burnt every bridge you've ever had in your

56
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:22,149
life. Like we would maybe have some friends over there. That's health. So if you ever hurt

57
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:29,350
and you need health, that's what health is. Okay. So I need that now. All right. I'm not,

58
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:34,230
can I be honest with you for a second? That like wicked loud fake laugh that I did,

59
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:43,829
like I hurt myself. I wait, what was that? I have you. I've captured you.

60
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:48,709
I thought that was you doing that. No, that was a very good impression. Wait,

61
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:51,269
wait, wait, wait. What do you mean? You, why do you have me doing that?

62
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,350
Well, I'll see. I'm a soul taker now. That's what I do. Whenever I play with people is I,

63
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,430
I take their souls through voice clips.

64
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:10,810
That's gonna, I, that's not going to get old. No way. All right. Let's get this.

65
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:18,170
I wish I could just play that. I thought you were just playing back a clip of you laughing.

66
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:28,470
Oh, no, no. Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't use your drill on those. You just, you hold down space,

67
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:33,830
the mail. I space. Oh, no, nobody's a weirdo like you that has like fucking space bar.

68
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:39,830
Hey, watch out for the crystals. What they shoot lightning. Don't hit them.

69
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:45,190
Don't wait. Are you serious? You just avoid these. Just don't look at, don't look,

70
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,149
don't look, don't look. It's like the thing in the Minecraft. You don't look at it.

71
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:53,370
Otherwise it comes for you. I'm still freaking out by the fact that you have this like

72
00:08:54,330 --> 00:09:01,659
the strange robot device that can capture me. That's not going to get old.

73
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,620
That's what I'm be saying. That I didn't say that he had, you know what? Like,

74
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,299
can I just, can I just say a couple of things and you just like, I'll just like play and

75
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:16,980
you can just like do a commentary. Okay. Okay. Give me the, I need them separately. Give me

76
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:24,809
an affirmative, like a yes. You got it. Okay. Now give me a negative. Nope.

77
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:34,840
You're not too sure anymore. Well, I don't get it. And I don't know anything you want.

78
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:42,809
Dude over here. Okay. That one is amazing. You can use that one at any time.

79
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,529
And hold on. I got the super light gun. Oh, wait, wrong, wrong one.

80
00:09:48,490 --> 00:10:09,820
You can, you can, you can have like, I do. I'd be careful. Oh, I figured what the button is,

81
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:17,139
but the button to call the, the guy over to you is pretty important. Also this nitrate,

82
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:22,259
very important. We're going to need it. I'm sorry. I cannot pay attention right now.

83
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:34,659
You're a little bit distracted. I'm still freaking out. You just been waiting for

84
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:40,309
an opportunity to use this. I love how the, Hey, let's be quiet and not like make any references

85
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:46,950
or any jokes at all. The entire stream lasted five minutes and now I'm going to make Jerva say

86
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:55,110
fucking crazy shit over himself is now the new thing. So what? Okay. We need to extract

87
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,210
more kite. More kind. Yeah. That's what we're looking for. It's the light blue.

88
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:07,129
So should I keep throwing out these, um, yeah, he's pop. You have a whole bunch of

89
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:11,049
them and we're going to need to come back later. And then you can, you can, they stay on the ground

90
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:15,289
forever. Wait, I got this. They turn off so you can like follow where you've been.

91
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:26,379
Oh, yeah. Drill it baby. Up or down. Um, you got it. No, I thought I just said that.

92
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:30,549
I didn't say that. You thought that you said that, but you didn't say that. Yes. I thought

93
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:34,230
I just said that, but I didn't. I just heard myself say that. Which way do we go? Up or

94
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:51,830
down? We go, uh, we go straight. Okay. What about this, uh, egg sack? Try torch the egg sack. Um,

95
00:11:51,830 --> 00:12:01,299
watch it. I don't know what these are actually. So the difficulties, what about the slugs?

96
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:06,600
I thought that was, I thought that was me as well. I thought that you just see that

97
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,960
your character yelling. That was me. You're freaking me out. Well, that's no, that's not

98
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:19,049
you. Okay. That's not you. Okay. I think I thought you like pitch shifted. Do you have

99
00:12:19,049 --> 00:12:24,740
any mineral? Do I have any minerals? Yeah, I have some. Where, what do I see? I just

100
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:30,970
went through the ground. Where's my mineral count at the bottom of your screen? If you've

101
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:35,700
picked up anything, you got, you got to dump it in there. I don't have anything. Okay. You

102
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:43,350
have nothing. Okay. We're good. Okay. So, uh, up or down, up or down straight down. Okay.

103
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:52,899
This is more kite. Oh, here we go. So should I not be control clicking on this at all?

104
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:58,419
Uh, no, that doesn't collect it. And then we got, we got swarm incoming,

105
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:02,259
incoming swarm. You got it. No, I, why am I saying you got it? That's like the

106
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:12,710
me fake me saying that dude over here. So is there something I should be doing? Um,

107
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,269
we're just, we're just in a corner here. You know how, you know, left or dead,

108
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:18,870
the zombies all rush you. We're getting ready. We're bracing for impact.

109
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:30,220
What am I, what are my grenades? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. You're

110
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:37,240
gonna have to throw one. So somebody clip that somebody clip him saying that right now. I gotta

111
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,519
do my own version of it. Get somebody clip him saying that and get, and give it to me.

112
00:13:41,240 --> 00:14:00,620
Wait, which way? You got it. You got it. Up or down? I don't know. This is not a really

113
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:12,870
big swarm. This is like three. Up or down? Up or down? Is it friendly fire? Uh, yes,

114
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,389
I think it depends on difficulty. We're, we're just doing like a simple mission right now.

115
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:19,509
You know, just, you know, get our bearings. Yeah. Oh, now, now we got brought.

116
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,409
My grenades are like a slow field. Let's see what mine do.

117
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:33,799
I think you might have like the TNT big explosion. Uh, that's not exploding. It's an

118
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:39,080
axe. Oh, you have an axe. Well, they just had like a, uh, an update as well to what

119
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:54,259
grenades do. Pretty, pretty sick. Out of ammo. Flip that dickhead. That was really mean. Like,

120
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:58,899
it was like rude. I wasn't sure if that was you saying that or me making you say that.

121
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:10,809
What do we do about this? It's like roly poly. Uh, what is that? What the hell? I

122
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:15,210
have no idea. I've never seen it before. This thing's huge. Get it right in his teeth.

123
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:26,220
It's a brain bug. It kind of is a brain bug. You got it.

124
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:37,750
Um, this is okay. They probably warned us about this at some point, like 50 years ago.

125
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:44,230
Right now I'm like laughing at not me. I'm laughing at myself,

126
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:47,750
but it's not even me, but it was me earlier. I'm going to die. No, I'm not.

127
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:57,830
How are you, how are you doing that? What? I dug into the wall so I could stand in it.

128
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:08,820
I thought you said I could drill up. Whoa. Okay. That was fucking scary.

129
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:17,799
Well, you got, you got to drill like, uh, that was diagonal up. I mean, I was,

130
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:22,519
I thought I was doing that. Oh, like worms, fossils, fossils. We got fossils.

131
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:32,139
So let me test this out. So you're talking about like worms. So if I go like this,

132
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:43,860
what about you? Yeah. You can make like this. Cool. Um, I forgot the button. Hey,

133
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:49,139
hey, anybody here from Twitch chat? I need the mule right here. How do I,

134
00:16:49,139 --> 00:17:00,120
I got to check the button. What do you need? We need to call in a supply drop for more ammo.

135
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:04,519
I forget the button. Uh, five. How do I know that? And you don't.

136
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:08,200
Yeah. How do you know that? Cause you just did the tutorial. See, I got, I can do it.

137
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:19,299
Should I do it too? No, only one of us can do it. This is ammo, I'm assuming. And you need,

138
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:27,000
uh, nitrous for this or whatever it is. That, okay. That scared me too. And I knew it was

139
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:40,710
coming. Should I just take them each side? No, leave those. Leave them. We need to collect,

140
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:46,549
uh, you see this red mineral up here? The red one? Yeah. That's what allows us to call that

141
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,990
supply drop in. So we can't, we don't just have them forever. So you're talking about

142
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:55,269
like that, right? The thing I'm mining right now. Red sugar. Yeah. You need like 90 or 80 of

143
00:17:55,269 --> 00:18:04,869
these. Okay. Well you can like fly around. I have to like walk. I have to like drill

144
00:18:04,869 --> 00:18:12,490
through the sky. Well, I'm sorry. You picked the driller. Well, that's your, you,

145
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:17,049
you collect them. I'll just be the guy that like hangs out and just watches me. I'll just

146
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:23,180
play the game. Yeah. Okay. Well, you already get, you know, you're already going up. It's

147
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:34,299
straight. We're going this way. Okay. Isn't there a map? Oh, there's, uh, there's a

148
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:38,859
four over here. It's tab probably M behind you, dude. Yeah, but you can handle it.

149
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:48,980
I don't know. Can I? Yeah, you can handle it. Look, so we're, we almost got,

150
00:18:48,980 --> 00:19:01,079
what do we need? 200? Yeah. So what about other minerals? Is there, are there rare

151
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:06,039
minerals? Like, holy shit, I see gold or something. There, there are. Um, if you see

152
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:09,559
a whole bunch of like circles in a wall, kind of, kind of like this, actually. You

153
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:14,359
see this over here and you see what's going on up there. So should I drill in

154
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:17,640
there? That means, uh, I'm pretty sure that's one of them. It looks a little

155
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,240
different. Usually inside the wall here. This is where you need drill guy to go

156
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,839
in there and drill up into that wall. Monster, uh, monster spawner in there.

157
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:34,170
Okay. I see more. I see more. Yeah. Just keep digging into the, the circle spot.

158
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:40,069
Okay. Until you find the pearl. It's like, find the pearl. Uh, and then

159
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:48,200
come back. It's like, it's over here. All right. Hey, have you found it yet?

160
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,059
I don't know. Now I'm just going to let you talk for me. How about now?

161
00:19:53,779 --> 00:20:03,099
Nope. Keep looking. Maybe it's below. It's, you know, it's somewhere around

162
00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:16,970
here. You think you're going around in circles around it? Come on, drill guy.

163
00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:31,930
I don't know. Nope. That's all I've got. Nope. You don't have a yes or don't you

164
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:41,400
have a dude come here? I have, uh, up or down. Down. Up or down. Down. It's

165
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:49,740
right in front of me. How do I get it? Oh, oh, well then, um, I got it. Oh,

166
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:54,490
now we've got to bring it back to the mule. You got it. Where's the mule

167
00:20:54,490 --> 00:21:03,829
from here? Can I throw this? It should be funny. It's straight down. Just go

168
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:11,299
for it. Did I just give you the EXP? Yeah. I got all the experience from

169
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:15,460
that. No, you didn't. You're not going to level ever. I don't know.

170
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:22,569
The thing is people know the truth because I come through clean and crisp

171
00:21:22,569 --> 00:21:29,369
and that comes through like not clean and crisp. All right. So I'm

172
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:33,049
looking at the map right now. These are rare materials too. They are

173
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:45,240
they? Buys more. Buys more. Yeah. Oh, that's cool. Point one buys more.

174
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:51,609
Yeah, you're going to need more than that. That's the fuel satellites

175
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:58,460
and the satellites. You can call, uh, call them down. Oh, that's

176
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,230
cool. All right. So what should we go from here? Let's open the map

177
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:14,519
that I knew about, but you didn't. Um, we go up, up or down,

178
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:22,230
up. Where are you? Well, I'm a loop bug over here. Is that like a

179
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:31,029
well, kill loop bug. Ooh. Where's my friend? I'm down. How can I

180
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:33,829
like tell you where I am? I'm like underneath you. I think there's

181
00:22:33,829 --> 00:22:41,480
a yell button. Oh, there you are. Yes. Okay. Come on. Yeah. Let's

182
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:50,279
let's go like up, not down. I don't know. I mean, I can't

183
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:53,720
remember which one just went pretty good about it, but now I'm

184
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,480
so confused. What is that? That's not going to get all.

185
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:04,599
All right. Ooh, what's this? Gold. It's gold. We need gold.

186
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:13,990
This is very annoying without anyone that can like go up walls.

187
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,900
What's the, I mean, I think you're the only person that

188
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:23,480
can get that. Oh yeah. Don't worry. I've got it. So should

189
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,640
I, are you collecting it or should I go on the ground and

190
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:32,299
collect it? I'm collecting. Okay. Good. What does that? What

191
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:37,579
does that really cool new cyberpunk trailer music mean?

192
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:51,769
Swarm. I do like the flame effects though. They're very

193
00:23:51,769 --> 00:24:00,220
cool. Over here. Over here. How difficult is that for you to

194
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:04,630
press that button? I do have to take my hand off my

195
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:07,750
mouse for a second. See, you should be focusing on the game

196
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:13,670
instead of your, how do you not have one? I screamed clipped

197
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:20,069
already. You still got these old, old material. There's a

198
00:24:20,069 --> 00:24:23,430
huge bug. There's a huge bug gaping dragon over here.

199
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:44,170
Yeah. Where'd it go? Oh, there he is. There he is.

200
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:52,099
Behind you. This hurts. I don't know. I really don't know.

201
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:54,900
I don't have to leap them all because I don't remember which

202
00:24:54,900 --> 00:25:00,549
one is which. There he is. There he is. Yeah. Keep that

203
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:03,029
one because they're here. There he is. There he is. There

204
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:05,750
he is. There he is. There he is. There he is. There he

205
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:14,059
is. There he is. Oh shit. That diamond just insta killed

206
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:22,059
him. I don't see him. Are you sure? Okay. I'm going

207
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:34,789
down. Fine. Fine. Does he drop anything or no? No. Is he

208
00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:39,019
just cool? He's just a cool guy. Just cool. All right. I

209
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:44,380
need some of that red sugar to heal, right? Yeah. Where's

210
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,740
it? Where's it? It's kryptonite or something. Where's

211
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:53,779
it called? It's I don't know. Let's go up. Is it

212
00:25:53,779 --> 00:25:56,500
like procedurally everything generated? Can we? Is it? Well,

213
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,380
do you have the map? What was the map button? Tab. Hold

214
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,880
tab. Tab. Well, yeah. If there was something up there,

215
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,799
you'd be able to see it on the map but yeah, you can just

216
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:09,559
like drill across or you want me to just go in here and

217
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:15,960
just drill. I'm gonna just go. Is this like Minecraft?

218
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,799
Should I not like ever drill what I don't know where

219
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:20,119
I'm drilling? Are we gonna fall into the lava? There's

220
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:25,319
no like bedrock or like a lava or anything. All right.

221
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:30,789
Well, we're just still going. Okay. I don't think

222
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:37,880
you're going anywhere. Am I not going anywhere? You

223
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:40,119
gotta look at the map. No, like look at where you

224
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:47,240
are like hold tab. Yeah. What about it? This is

225
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,839
not I like if you you rotate the map, you'd be

226
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:56,920
able to see a room but so what not going

227
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:02,970
anywhere. So, can I not have I not going anywhere

228
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:06,890
but why can I dig over here though? Why not? Well,

229
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:12,490
why what's what there's no secrets over here. You

230
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,970
know, you're the hardest person to record sound

231
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,769
bites for because like it doesn't start recording

232
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:21,750
until you start talking but you have like most of

233
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,950
the things you say are filler words. Well, why

234
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:29,960
what's what there's no secrets over here. Like

235
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,119
most people I can just get a straight like

236
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:36,119
there's no secrets over here. Not you.

237
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:44,069
Oh, big fun. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. There's

238
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:47,769
no secrets over here. Oh, what are we doing? Oh,

239
00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:53,109
that is a big bug. Yeah, shoot them in the butt.

240
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:57,849
Oh, he dropped something. Am I not supposed to

241
00:27:57,849 --> 00:28:01,289
be touching that? No, that's poison. But no,

242
00:28:01,289 --> 00:28:04,009
there actually is like a globe in there. Wait,

243
00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:07,269
come back this way. We're gonna keep drilling.

244
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,529
I thought you just told me that this was not

245
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:13,740
something I should be doing. Don't you want

246
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,650
to see what's that way? Wasn't the whole

247
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:19,609
point that I was stupid for doing this? Well,

248
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:36,009
what's what there's no secrets over here.

249
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:46,140
Am I not going anywhere? I don't understand.

250
00:28:46,779 --> 00:28:52,059
Well, what's what there's no secrets over here.

251
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:02,170
Oh, he dropped something.

252
00:29:07,349 --> 00:29:10,250
Hold on, look at the map. Am I not going

253
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:16,779
anywhere? Hold on. Should we turn around,

254
00:29:16,779 --> 00:29:29,190
right? Is this not it? Right. So that doesn't

255
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:33,339
you can just do that for fun. No,

256
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:34,619
that's a serious business. Just wait till

257
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:36,700
they patch that out next patch. We found

258
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:42,069
an exploit. This just didn't. Miners can

259
00:29:42,069 --> 00:29:45,930
mine in ground. We've removed it. We think

260
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:48,250
players had too much freedom. All right,

261
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:51,670
so you went down. Yeah, up or down?

262
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,640
Oh, yeah, we gotta go this. We haven't

263
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,079
gone this way. All right, cool.

264
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:10,250
Just like an actual one or health or health

265
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:18,250
over here. Health globes. Hey, I got some

266
00:30:18,809 --> 00:30:19,930
one hundred and seventy five out of two

267
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:27,220
hundred. Just gonna keep going up. So

268
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,339
who's the best character in the game?

269
00:30:28,339 --> 00:30:30,819
What's the coolest character? The coolest.

270
00:30:30,819 --> 00:30:33,859
I really do like a drill guy. There's

271
00:30:33,859 --> 00:30:36,259
one fun thing. Like after you collect

272
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:38,579
all the minerals, you have to retrace

273
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:40,019
your struts, your steps to get back up

274
00:30:40,019 --> 00:30:42,660
to the starting spot, right? Or trace

275
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,900
your strep. The drill guy could just

276
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,579
drill like a straight line straight

277
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:49,700
back to it. Especially if you're on

278
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,059
like a harder level and that because

279
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:55,269
the levels get really huge. They seem

280
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:56,710
like they seem like they could get big.

281
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,869
Hey, you ever play this game called

282
00:30:58,869 --> 00:31:02,390
Apex Legends? No, not once. OK, well

283
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,829
first of all, Apex Legends is better

284
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:06,470
than this game. And there's the

285
00:31:06,549 --> 00:31:08,150
character Pathfinder and he has, you

286
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,069
know, ziplines. There's a zipline

287
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:11,029
character just like that.

288
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,470
Underneath you there's this health

289
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,150
underneath you. Like grab it right

290
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,670
underneath like with that rocket.

291
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,349
I'm not hurt. Straight below you.

292
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:22,839
This is health on her. Are you dead?

293
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:27,259
What? No. Are you dead right now?

294
00:31:27,259 --> 00:31:30,700
Am I dead? No. Why? I'm mining over

295
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,319
here. You look like you're dead.

296
00:31:35,539 --> 00:31:37,539
Dead? Like what happens when you die?

297
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:38,900
Can you can you be like revived or

298
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,440
what? Well, no, you just you're just

299
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,440
dead forever. What? Do you see a dead

300
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,509
body on the screen? Yeah, there's one

301
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:50,390
like right down this pit. What? I'm

302
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:53,670
like I'm like fucking over here mining

303
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,769
this red shit. You don't see me over

304
00:31:55,769 --> 00:31:57,769
here. I'm pressing X. Do you see me

305
00:31:57,769 --> 00:32:00,970
hitting the red thing? I got you.

306
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:04,359
What the fuck just happened? What the

307
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:06,599
fuck's going on? Why am I here?

308
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:08,900
Hey, there's health over here. You

309
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,660
just like ported me back. Am I

310
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,019
lagging? You just like ported me back.

311
00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:13,779
I was like in a fucking wall.

312
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:20,099
Can you like teleport people to?

313
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:22,099
That's weird. Yeah, there's a I'm

314
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:23,299
playing teleport guy.

315
00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:25,220
Oh, no, I just I got like pulled

316
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:28,420
back. That's weird.

317
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,779
I actually forget what the other guy

318
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:35,940
does. So we we

319
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:38,259
need to find fossils. We need to

320
00:32:38,259 --> 00:32:39,619
find fossils. I think they actually

321
00:32:39,619 --> 00:32:42,119
show up on the scanner too.

322
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:46,920
Do they? Let me go this way. I've

323
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,359
we've been messing around so much I

324
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:49,799
have no clue where we've been and

325
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:51,720
haven't been. And also like every 10

326
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,319
minutes my computer has been freaking

327
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:55,000
out and it just starts like freezing up

328
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,400
and I can't do anything about it.

329
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:02,789
I'm sorry to hear that. I'm not very

330
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:05,589
I don't like this character.

331
00:33:05,589 --> 00:33:06,789
I want the character that can fly

332
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:08,069
around.

333
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:13,140
Well, I'm at crystals. Hey, there's a

334
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,579
lot of bugs.

335
00:33:14,579 --> 00:33:19,140
I need your help. Where you at? I'm

336
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,579
worried. I think I'm going to die.

337
00:33:20,579 --> 00:33:22,579
Hit, shout, shout, shout, shout. I

338
00:33:22,579 --> 00:33:28,069
don't know where you are.

339
00:33:28,069 --> 00:33:29,349
What happens if they hit me? What,

340
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:31,109
you see the audience screen?

341
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:33,259
Shout again. I can't see you. I don't

342
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:34,299
know where you are.

343
00:33:34,299 --> 00:33:49,799
Watch out. I got this one. I got this.

344
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:51,160
Watch out.

345
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:59,099
Told you. What's the big circle here?

346
00:33:59,099 --> 00:34:00,299
The big blue circle. That's what I was

347
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:01,259
talking about before. That's my

348
00:34:01,259 --> 00:34:02,380
grenade.

349
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,380
That's a flow field. I can't see

350
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,500
anything.

351
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:14,300
Help me. Shit. I'm not gonna lie. I

352
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,019
have no clue.

353
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:20,579
Like I would not lie to you.

354
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:23,210
I mean you you have many times. We're

355
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,329
gonna run around

356
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:26,489
and and get the last fossils. We get

357
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:28,329
the heck out of here.

358
00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:29,369
Yeah, well you're the one that made

359
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:30,809
this a comedy stream. We would

360
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:32,010
this is supposed to be a boring play

361
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,369
the game stream and you made it a

362
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:35,130
comedy stream by making like recording

363
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,650
me. Come over here. Without me

364
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,409
telling you you could.

365
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,210
I want to make sure you're aware of

366
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,690
that. I didn't sign any release form.

367
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,530
Tell me when I have permission to

368
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,969
record you.

369
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:47,849
Not now. You don't have permission

370
00:34:47,849 --> 00:34:49,690
to record me right now.

371
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:54,139
Okay, I'm not. Okay, good. I would

372
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:55,420
hate to have to get legal involved

373
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,380
in this one.

374
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:00,420
I have a drill. Why would I be doing

375
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:05,980
this? I don't know. Have we probably

376
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,500
walked by

377
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,500
a ton of these? Is gold up here? I just

378
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,940
no, I just grabbed it.

379
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:17,559
So we're looking for the fossil

380
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:20,489
looking thing, right?

381
00:35:20,489 --> 00:35:24,900
I'm out of ammo.

382
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,059
Mike, I'm out of uh shit. Sorry, I know

383
00:35:29,059 --> 00:35:30,739
we don't like to use real names. Um

384
00:35:30,739 --> 00:35:34,150
I'm out of uh ammo.

385
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,309
Please never say that again. I would

386
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:38,309
hate. Hate to have to get legal

387
00:35:38,309 --> 00:35:41,639
involved in this one.

388
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:48,360
I need ammo. Uh what's that uh

389
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,480
supply thing or should I just drop

390
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,510
another one? I don't know if we can.

391
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:57,219
I don't see where those are. You need

392
00:35:57,219 --> 00:35:59,539
like 80 nitra.

393
00:35:59,539 --> 00:36:01,880
Is there something on the minimap or

394
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,760
something that indicates if there's a

395
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,119
fossil around?

396
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:07,349
Or like the scanner or something? Because

397
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:09,190
I'm just trying to find one too. I'm pretty sure.

398
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:13,820
Oh, we're like nowhere near each other

399
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,659
either. No, I'm just looking for

400
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:17,179
fossils. They have that weird

401
00:36:17,179 --> 00:36:19,260
nautilus look to them, right?

402
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,380
Yeah. It's like the uh Pokemon.

403
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,099
You know Pokemon. I don't. Are you

404
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,539
excited for um

405
00:36:26,539 --> 00:36:31,000
Pokemon, Blood and Gore? Oh. See mine was

406
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,760
like nice. Yours was mean and horrible.

407
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,840
Pokemon, Blood and Gore.

408
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,199
They're going with a more mature

409
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:42,039
route. They figured after a Detective

410
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:43,079
Pikachu,

411
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:44,599
like everyone who likes Pokemon is a

412
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:45,639
bit older now and it's time for

413
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:48,550
Pokemon Blood and Gore.

414
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:52,309
Uh Pokemon Sex and Drugs.

415
00:36:52,389 --> 00:36:54,469
That's next. They're testing the waters

416
00:36:54,469 --> 00:36:56,539
with Blood and Gore.

417
00:36:56,539 --> 00:36:59,369
I'm going up. Okay, I think I have all

418
00:36:59,369 --> 00:37:00,489
the fossils.

419
00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:04,090
It says we have six out of ten. Yeah,

420
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,449
I'm carrying four.

421
00:37:05,449 --> 00:37:11,780
Oh, you have four. Okay. Can you shout

422
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,110
for me?

423
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:15,429
I'm so far away. Yeah, you are really

424
00:37:15,429 --> 00:37:17,610
far away.

425
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,809
You can start heading back to the

426
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:21,210
ship because once I can deposit this,

427
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,489
we're leaving.

428
00:37:22,489 --> 00:37:24,570
Um the ship is. I called the mule to

429
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,250
me. The ship is just the thing that

430
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,130
looks like a ship

431
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:32,090
on the screen, right? Yeah, I think. Why

432
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,539
is it moving?

433
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:36,019
Why is it? Oh, no, no, that's the mule.

434
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:38,500
So where where's the ship? Where's the

435
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,940
ship? I'm gonna like leave you on this

436
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:40,820
planet.

437
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,139
Don't do that. This is about to be

438
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:44,420
really bad.

439
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,099
But where about where is the ship

440
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:47,460
from here?

441
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:51,929
Um is there on the. Is it on the

442
00:37:51,929 --> 00:37:52,650
map? I think it's

443
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,329
way up on the map. You just need to

444
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:55,610
start going up.

445
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:58,329
It'll. I think it'll show you once

446
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:01,690
I complete the quest thingy. Okay. Normally,

447
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:04,440
you're meant to follow

448
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,760
the mule. All right, well um I'm just

449
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,280
gonna dig. I'm digging straight up.

450
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:14,380
Hopefully, I don't drown myself.

451
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,699
Mule has a button. Somebody said the

452
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:18,300
mule has a button.

453
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,500
Yeah, it has a button that I press

454
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,099
and then like the mission ends and

455
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,780
swarms all come after you.

456
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,739
Oh, and you have to get to the

457
00:38:23,739 --> 00:38:27,670
exit. Because the bugs know that

458
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,949
you're leaving and they're like

459
00:38:28,949 --> 00:38:35,739
bonely. I'm just making this harder.

460
00:38:35,739 --> 00:38:37,500
I'm making this slower and harder by

461
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,579
just going through the a tunnel to the

462
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:40,059
left.

463
00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:42,780
There's no reason to do this. I just

464
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,059
bought out guys. I don't

465
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:46,780
I'm making it harder. I am. I'm making

466
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,059
it harder. I just got it. I got it.

467
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:53,429
Got it. I gave it. I gave it.

468
00:38:53,429 --> 00:38:56,389
Here it goes. I don't have any more fuel.

469
00:38:56,389 --> 00:39:02,519
Got an axe. I'm about to be in deep

470
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:03,880
shit aren't I?

471
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,719
Oh okay. Now it shows you drop pod.

472
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:07,400
You see where that is? Drop pod.

473
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,159
That's actually not that far.

474
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:11,000
Okay, that's where you gotta go.

475
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:16,139
I'm out of fuel. How do I get fuel?

476
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:18,699
You need to resupply. You should be able

477
00:39:18,699 --> 00:39:20,809
to call one now.

478
00:39:20,809 --> 00:39:26,199
I don't have enough.

479
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:28,199
No, I can see it. I can see it. I can see it.

480
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:32,170
Okay. The other fun strat

481
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:35,369
when you call in the supplies

482
00:39:35,369 --> 00:39:39,030
it drills from like the top down.

483
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,630
So if you call it underneath a

484
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,230
launch pod or something it just makes

485
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,590
a straight line up.

486
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:53,179
Yeah, I'm here. Okay, I'm on my way.

487
00:39:53,179 --> 00:39:57,460

488
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:04,440
I am. I'm bugging out. What's this?

489
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:12,099
Oh, it's just a... My computer's on the fritz.

490
00:40:12,099 --> 00:40:13,539
You look like your computer's having

491
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:18,420

00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,019

00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:27,530
Yeah, I'm getting on it. There you go.

495
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:29,929
That was baby mission for babies.

496
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:31,289
That just looked like it said no

497
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:33,659

00:40:33,659 --> 00:40:39,699

00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,039
Why do we do the Grand Theft Auto 5

501
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:48,039

00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:53,449
Shit. Oh, you win a race.

503
00:40:53,449 --> 00:40:56,250
So Jadiz and Vizmoor.

504
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,329
Do we use these for stuff?

505
00:40:58,329 --> 00:41:00,170
Oh yeah, I'll show you that now.

506
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:02,650
I'll show you what you use the Jadiz on.

507
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:09,699
Sick. Sick.

508
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:11,539
How many chins does the driller have?

509
00:41:11,539 --> 00:41:18,420
A lot.

510
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:22,900
So I did perks. I did one already.

511
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,059
Oh yeah, come, come, come, come, come, come.

512
00:41:25,059 --> 00:41:27,880
What's up? Where are you?

513
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,940
You come down here in these terminals

514
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,860
like equipment

515
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,699
and you can upgrade your equipment and

516
00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:36,739
get new stuff.

517
00:41:36,739 --> 00:41:39,860
Oh, this is cool. I think this one's

518
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,780
cosmetics. Yeah, this is all your

519
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:44,219
upgrades.

520
00:41:44,219 --> 00:41:45,820
Locked weapon. So when you click on a

521
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,500
gun it has like tiers

522
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,500
where it goes down. You can only

523
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,059
have one perk equipped per tier.

524
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:53,820
And so I need to level your money.

525
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,579
You need to be, this is level four

526
00:41:55,579 --> 00:42:02,730

527
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:04,409
four, eight, twelve, sixteen that goes

528
00:42:04,409 --> 00:42:09,110
down? I don't know what you're talking

529
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:09,590
about.

530
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,030
When you're in the equipment, when you

531
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,789
open up a piece of equipment.

532
00:42:12,789 --> 00:42:14,869
Right, like open up your equipment and

533
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:16,309
this should be

534
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:19,030
red. Oh yeah, you need to unlock

535
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,469
levels. Those are your levels that you

536
00:42:20,469 --> 00:42:21,349
need to be.

537
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:22,949
So should I increase the range of

538
00:42:22,949 --> 00:42:24,550

539
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:26,969

00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:31,530
Oh, it's Vizmoor. Okay, it's 1200

543
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:32,730

Yeah, keep it up. It really does feel like you just got control here. Oh, it's the jukebox. Okay, isn't this romantic?

647
00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:37,840
Okay, you're a real funny tuber doing the floss. Somebody just said I'm unsubbing

648
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:43,820
My computer was taken over. I had no control over that environment if it was under my control

649
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,139
I would not have done that

650
00:48:45,139 --> 00:48:48,650
Yeah, I'll kick up fucking water bucket into his head. It's making you happy

651
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:53,730
What what wait I need to upgrade equipment

652
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,760
What is your guys ability now? I don't know. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what what if I got to it?

653
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:06,670
What did he do it up a doing ability? Um, I don't know. Are you sure I don't know

654
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:12,730
How do I look at it? You start a mission and then you you play the game. All right

655
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:14,730
Well, this is the deal. I'm just gonna place this guy

656
00:49:14,929 --> 00:49:20,949
But uh, yeah, you do it too you just did it everybody does that especially you just you know

657
00:49:20,949 --> 00:49:26,650
You because you're a fool and I want you to know that you're a fool. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay

658
00:49:30,349 --> 00:49:32,349
I didn't get that one

659
00:49:39,909 --> 00:49:43,610
It's too long for you to have the the part that you want

660
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,400
I

661
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:54,769
Okay, I'm setting this to hazard for extreme. Are you ready? Why would you do that?

662
00:49:55,409 --> 00:50:03,079
What why would you make it that hard? Okay, we're doing hazard three. We were on hazard two and that was baby mode

663
00:50:03,659 --> 00:50:11,849
All right. Well, so we're gonna go up to three and you handle it salvage two mules

664
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:18,269
There's no secrets over here. I can't tell if that's the original one or if that's the one of those that I did

665
00:50:18,269 --> 00:50:20,889
Previously, I don't know. That's a previous

666
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:34,800
Okay, what 12 a poker blue these flowers

667
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:39,039
Yeah, we got to get on poke balls

668
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:54,400
Where's the escape pod the mule leaves behind a trail of green markers when it returns to the escape pod follow those

669
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,000
Oh, that's cool

670
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,920
Why did Mike Mike hit a slow than yours?

671
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,300
What do you have for processor

672
00:51:07,099 --> 00:51:08,099
45,000 K 20

673
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:12,860
I don't want to bet I don't want to be the guy League of Legends that fucking loads in last you look like an asshole

674
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,900
loads in last I

675
00:51:16,019 --> 00:51:21,980
Don't want to be the little guy the League of Legends the fuck loads in last. I don't want to be that guy

676
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:26,539
All right, hold everybody hustle hustle

677
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,130
Okay, we need we got a salvage to you

678
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:37,650
Okay, so I have a tether oh

679
00:51:38,889 --> 00:51:41,570
Yeah, you're the guy with the wires. Yeah

680
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:48,809
Okay, well your wire guy. Okay. He's just testing. I'm test. I just want all right cool

681
00:51:49,809 --> 00:51:51,690
That's how that works. Nice

682
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:55,630
All right. So we need to salvage. What are these?

683
00:51:56,349 --> 00:51:59,159
Whoa, yeah, I think they just

684
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,400
Also, if you're going up these you press reverse

685
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:08,539
You can just like hover over a chasm. So when a lot of bugs come out you can kind of just fill in the middle

686
00:52:08,539 --> 00:52:11,860
Oh, I see you can just like go backwards. That's cool

687
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:17,070
That is really watch out there. Why watch what about there's some flying bugs in this game

688
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:23,590
So is that my only means of transportation? I have to use this to get up there wherever you're going

689
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:26,070
Yeah, or you can just like

690
00:52:26,389 --> 00:52:30,860
You can just minecraft your way in I guess you can

691
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:35,539
It's not far. Then you're gonna want to save uses of your uh, yeah

692
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:46,570
Grapple. All right, let's get going. Good thing. I just wasted two of them. Yeah, watch out. There's a pit here

693
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:57,659
Okay, don't worry. So is this an opportunity to use this? Yeah, it's just too

694
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:02,199
It's a too steep now, it's really steep

695
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:11,639
How do I get out of here now if I'm this character

696
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:20,199
It looks too steep. I think I think you got it. Do I actually have to dig out of here?

697
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:36,420
Yeah here here here dig with me on this side. It should have brought a driller perhaps maybe

698
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:41,059
What is the other guy? There's the scout the driller the

699
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:49,380
Engineer but oh, yeah, you like build the turret. Yep. He builds turrets. All right. Thank you. Oh, yeah

700
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,380
No, and he makes platforms. He's really good

701
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:59,619
Makes plow that's awesome. Yeah, maybe I should play him so we can actually, you know get some teamwork going but I

702
00:54:00,219 --> 00:54:04,699
What am I supposed to do about this? Can I make this jump? Is that gonna am I gonna hit the wall?

703
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:14,949
Can I jump from here? Can I jump from here? I try I don't know

704
00:54:15,389 --> 00:54:24,800
Yep. All right, cool. Let's go. Are those the flowers we need? Oh, yeah, and you can dig while you're on it

705
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:29,019
You can like make a foothold. I mean, I wish we had a driller

706
00:54:29,619 --> 00:54:31,219
We did

707
00:54:31,219 --> 00:54:35,130
And I'd be really helpful right now if we had someone who could drill through this

708
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:49,719
We can but we're doing it manual drilling. I'm just burying the axe in the back of your head

709
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:58,980
That's what I think about you. Oh, there goes what does that mean? I don't what was what's on the computer?

710
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:04,980
I have no idea. It's been doing this with every game and I have no idea why what do you have for a graphics card?

711
00:55:07,309 --> 00:55:09,309
I have 240 80

712
00:55:09,989 --> 00:55:14,349
To a 240 80. I think it's like a tight next pass. Is this like

713
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:20,349
2804 be more than that. It's like what year is it? It's like it's like

714
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:23,190
1900

715
00:55:23,429 --> 00:55:29,599
1900 you help me mine this I can't even go. Okay, there's like a

716
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:41,230
What are these dead we shouldn't have done that that was not but they weren't a threat the environment will

717
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:55,429
You're the most like environmentally conscious dwarf I have ever seen

718
00:55:58,179 --> 00:56:01,760
We only know

719
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:09,510
Digging and killing but he just not drop anything here

720
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:20,610
I wish I could see more light. Oh, well, I have the light gun

721
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:23,409
Then your job

722
00:56:23,409 --> 00:56:28,750
Yeah, but like I'm not blind. So I've been fine. That's cuz you turn your gamma all the way up

723
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:30,550
I've been I've been to his house

724
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:37,170
You haven't been to Austin and he turns up his gamma all the way and then pretends like he can see really well

725
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:39,210
It's bullshit

726
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:50,000
Look out we got blood. Yes, we do

727
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,900
Remember we're at a higher hazard level German

728
00:56:53,900 --> 00:57:04,820
I like this this game actually is really fun when you have people and you're on the really high difficulty

729
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:06,739
You got a hustle

730
00:57:06,739 --> 00:57:08,980
There's a million buggos seems like it

731
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:17,900
But you just can't stop making jokes for more than like two seconds I didn't start it for loads in last

732
00:57:21,659 --> 00:57:25,179
Alright cool

733
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:35,480
You can't take cadences and make that some kind of an insult like everybody has cadences

734
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,000
You can't make a cadence it is like come on

735
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:49,780
It's a cat I have we all have cadences form of like political correctness were you like

736
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:55,530
Cadence you can't make fun of a cadence

737
00:57:56,849 --> 00:57:59,219
Alright cool

738
00:58:00,099 --> 00:58:02,820
Get down here. Where are you my cadences?

739
00:58:05,429 --> 00:58:08,630
Daring

740
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:13,489
How'd you feel about always sunny being a TV show at e3

741
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:18,699
It wasn't it was only one. Are you all right? Was that your computer?

742
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:23,119
Yeah, my computer just I didn't I guess I did what what's going on here

743
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:29,000
It was one person from the it's not even

744
00:58:31,159 --> 00:58:33,159
Cast

745
00:58:33,159 --> 00:58:36,920
Games are dumb watch my new show. No, it was one guy

746
00:58:37,159 --> 00:58:39,159
And all right, I'm in trouble

747
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,420
Who is doing this what the fuck is going on to me

748
00:58:50,309 --> 00:58:55,670
You see I'm shouting I don't know

749
00:58:56,630 --> 00:59:00,789
We got swarmed and you ran away and started making always sunny references separate it

750
00:59:01,429 --> 00:59:04,239
Look, I'm shouting what?

751
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:10,239
Oh god, you're fucking what is going on right now. You're loading in last right now

752
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:12,400
Loads in last

753
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,400
I'm flying

754
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,880
I am flying around getting carried away by a bug

755
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:28,559
Shouldn't have dropped me getting it. I'm coming. I'm still i'm fine. That's like a smoker

756
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:36,199
Can you shout so I know you are?

757
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:39,239
There you are. I don't know. How did you even get over there?

758
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,440
Well, I saw that you were down here and I was

759
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Seeing if I could

760
00:59:47,909 --> 00:59:51,570
It seemed faster

761
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:56,159
You're flying

762
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:59,440
This is what happens when you're in a dream when you're in a flying flying dream

763
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,679
You don't have control of where you're flying. You just know you are

764
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:16,000
Jeremy i'm taking care of this bug. All right, this bug is dead here. You see where I am

765
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:19,599
Yeah, okay. Let's go

766
01:00:21,539 --> 01:00:23,619
All right. Um, I just showed up just in time

767
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:30,920
I dug a really big hole for you

768
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:32,920
You did that for me?

769
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,920
I did it for you

770
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:47,039
Let there be life

771
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:50,719
There's my hole I think is that no, that's not my hole. There it is up there

772
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:55,880
That's a big hole

773
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:56,760
What?

774
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,760
You can fly around you have a grapple hook

775
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:05,059
What does that have to do with anything that has to do with you have to be aware that I can't do that

776
01:01:05,219 --> 01:01:07,300
You have to help me. I'm the ground force

777
01:01:09,269 --> 01:01:11,539
Okay, edf

778
01:01:11,539 --> 01:01:13,639
Yeah, that'll be fun. We are the valiant

779
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:16,789
infantry

780
01:01:16,789 --> 01:01:19,119
We're the

781
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:24,159
That's the only thing I know

782
01:01:24,159 --> 01:01:27,199
Defend our mother earth from any alley and attack

783
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:32,800
Huge room

784
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,300
Oh, is this is this one of the mules?

785
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:37,989
Probably

786
01:01:37,989 --> 01:01:39,889
That looks like a mule and watch out

787
01:01:39,889 --> 01:01:44,769
All right. These things just are blowing up all over the place around us. I'm almost dead. They're bainlings. Those things are horrible

788
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:53,519
Oh shit

789
01:01:53,519 --> 01:02:02,360
I think we got to dig this up. Oh, yeah. We got to we got to pick up all the parts

790
01:02:05,429 --> 01:02:15,090
What oh

791
01:02:15,809 --> 01:02:19,889
Oh help help help help my computer's lagging

792
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:24,849
I can't help you. Uh, three more of those creepers came and exploded on us

793
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:33,809
How did you end up down there I got picked up by a fly bug

794
01:02:34,849 --> 01:02:36,849
He just threw you down the hole

795
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,960
Where's my recorder where's my recorder for it?

796
01:02:55,719 --> 01:02:57,719
Why'd you have it on hazard five

797
01:02:58,199 --> 01:03:02,599
I didn't I had it on hazard like we're confident people that can play this game

798
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:13,760
Guys, can I have like a thousand people diagnose my computer problem all at once?

799
01:03:20,099 --> 01:03:22,099
Uh, all right, I know I can help you

800
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,500
Give me the symptoms. When do they start?

801
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,480
It's like inner minutely

802
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:34,880
Every like 10 minutes, okay, my game freezes like four times. Do you have any hard disks?

803
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:38,679
No, are you all solid state?

804
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,760

806
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:48,949
Good question

807
01:03:48,949 --> 01:03:51,889

808
01:03:57,489 --> 01:04:00,920

813
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:18,849
2017 joke

01:04:18,849 --> 01:04:22,210
Yeah, I mean you do them sometimes you were doing the flossing dance earlier

815
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:28,019

819
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:43,940
I did not do the floss you put the jukebox on and took control of my computer and made that happen

820
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,780
But I also did see you dab before

821
01:04:48,579 --> 01:04:53,619
So have you

Please just let the barrels be

824
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,920
Last time you're on my own

825
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:08,320
All right. Let's let's do that mission again, but not on like ultra inferno mode. That was that's like normal difficulty. Is this

01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:12,050
Let me see

827
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:14,050
We should be able to do that

828
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:24,760
He's deflecting i'm not deflecting we're doing it the same difficulty

829
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,960
And you know what i'm gonna switch characters

830
01:05:29,199 --> 01:05:31,570
Tell him I that's what i'm gonna do

831
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:34,929
So that I can work together with you and you know, we can both be low level newbies

832
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:37,489
So i'm gonna be the driller again. I kind of like that. It was fun

833
01:05:38,690 --> 01:05:42,849
Okay, and i'll be the engineer so at least I can travel around now and I have an upgrade now

834
01:05:43,409 --> 01:05:46,280
Do you accept me?

835
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,280

839
01:06:08,199 --> 01:06:12,519
Yep. All right

840
01:06:12,519 --> 01:06:14,519

You played too many other how many other people you got on that sound board it was normal man was talking to me

842
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:26,719

Everyone banded together and killed justin so I replaced him with kimberly

850
01:06:50,369 --> 01:06:53,250
But kimberly was secretly the person who killed justin so I had to get rid of kimberly

851
01:06:53,730 --> 01:06:56,369
And then we got japanese voice lady who apparently is god

852
01:06:57,250 --> 01:07:02,690
And we went through a couple of different guys and now it's normal guy normal man who likes, uh, white bread and tennis

01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:07,619
You should probably go to a doctor if I would have

Give you some advice. You probably should hit up a doctor

855

How do we know that i'm not one of the voices in your head

857
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:34,840
I don't know. How could you i've been playing alone this whole time

858
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:37,800

Is this when the curtain comes up and there's an audience back here?

867
01:08:14,199 --> 01:08:24,239

Are you picking up flowers are you just being fucking I just I got two flowers i'm holding them right now

1009
01:19:57,829 --> 01:20:03,270
Bunch of dwarves. Oh, we're tough dwarves big beards. Let's go pick flowers. Well, I had none of the dwarves

1010
01:20:03,989 --> 01:20:05,989
the default dwarf

1011
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:11,270
This can't be a dwarf game unless

1012
01:20:11,510 --> 01:20:13,510
One of them talks like this

1013
01:20:13,989 --> 01:20:17,050
I mean they do a little bit. All right

1014
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:19,609
No, they have to do

1015
01:20:19,609 --> 01:20:21,609
That's the only way you can tell if it's a dwarf if they go

1016
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:29,829
All right

1017
01:20:29,829 --> 01:20:32,060
Okay

1018
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:33,909
Uh, where have we not been?

1019
01:20:33,909 --> 01:20:34,869
I don't know

1020
01:20:34,869 --> 01:20:37,109
Have we been down this tunnel?

1021
01:20:37,109 --> 01:20:39,640
Now we we go up

1022
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,020
Up or down

1023
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:43,020
I don't think we've been this way. Oh, there's nothing

1024
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:47,239
Put the shrek voice over a dwarf and it's perfect

1025
01:20:49,659 --> 01:20:56,890
All right, just follow me. I'm taking this up

1026
01:20:58,090 --> 01:20:59,960
We can go up

1027
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:01,960
Where where are you?

1028
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:04,020

01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:07,479
Okay, take me up pick me up

1030
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:11,239
Have we been like up we've been like here, right?

1031
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:16,460
No, there's not any um

1032
01:21:16,939 --> 01:21:18,939
Or what? Um, I don't know

1033
01:21:19,829 --> 01:21:24,710
Where is it until you miss go until you miss? I don't have it. You don't have it

1034
01:21:30,789 --> 01:21:35,109
I couldn't find it. Why do you still have to go until you miss one? Yeah this flower

1035
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:42,789
Well, it's funny when I do it but then when you when you do it you get to funny no

1036
01:21:42,789 --> 01:21:48,869
No, no, no, no when you do it you get to then catch yourself and then pretend that you're making fun of me

1037
01:21:50,279 --> 01:21:55,319
Oh, I get it. I see. It's not funny cerebral cadence is a serious disorder

1038
01:21:56,279 --> 01:21:58,279
It's funny when I go

1039
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:00,840
Up, uh, oh, hey, i'm doing the turbo. All right

1040
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:03,800
Right, right. Oh

1041
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,000
interesting

1042
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:14,460
It's funny when I do it

1043
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:17,659
I don't know. What is every dwarf is the exact same character. Don't say that

1044
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:20,729
Do we know we haven't been this way come come this way

1045
01:22:22,149 --> 01:22:24,699
There's eyeballs over here

1046
01:22:24,699 --> 01:22:27,189

1047
01:22:27,189 --> 01:22:31,909
It just drill these eyeballs dude. Calm down jerma. This is right here fun

1050
01:22:38,939 --> 01:22:41,619
They're moving around

1051
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:59,609
That's common rock. How would that be common? That's pretty uncommon. There's nothing even in there

1052
01:23:01,770 --> 01:23:04,090
You're supposed to drill them to death. I did

1053
01:23:04,810 --> 01:23:06,810
And now you can't get the secret

1054
01:23:08,489 --> 01:23:10,489
I thought I did I thought he did I guess not

1055
01:23:17,989 --> 01:23:20,630

The sugar the red sugar health thing. I feel like I know what that tastes like. What does it taste like?

1064
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:09,420

1065
01:24:10,710 --> 01:24:13,270

Well this uh, we ended up kind of this way

1071
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:38,939
Oh, we're just back in this room. That's exactly what I was thinking. Is that right?

1072
01:24:39,739 --> 01:24:42,680
I feel like we're talking to the germa soundboard

1073
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:45,880

At least one of you remain by the charging fuel cells. All right, let's just stand back here

1142
01:31:00,810 --> 01:31:05,239
You're gonna get overwhelmed people above you too

1143
01:31:06,359 --> 01:31:08,359
I got my turrets up. It's fine

1144
01:31:11,210 --> 01:31:16,460
Here here I know how to do this. Here's the here's how we do it

1145
01:31:18,979 --> 01:31:20,979
We build a house

1146
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:28,220
Build a house watch out the exploded. Well now it's just damaging my house

1147
01:31:29,659 --> 01:31:32,090

1148
01:31:32,729 --> 01:31:38,229

01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:44,859
Shut up, I don't care if I were jeopardizing the mission. This is my life. I only have one

1150
01:31:47,319 --> 01:31:49,319
Yolo a one life gameplay

01:31:54,390 --> 01:31:57,029
Up here must have been 10 minutes

1152
01:32:03,699 --> 01:32:07,319
I can get this dude. Where's he going around the other corner?

1153

You can't say that okay, we're almost done

1156
01:32:52,810 --> 01:33:02,649
One minute and 12 seconds interesting come on

1157
01:33:07,550 --> 01:33:08,989
What's that?

1158
01:33:08,989 --> 01:33:11,760
build

1159
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,760
Oh, that's your turret

1160
01:33:23,949 --> 01:33:29,789
You've gone there like what are you talking about here? What are you talking about? What are you even saying?

1161
01:33:30,989 --> 01:33:32,989
People are trying to like

1162
01:33:33,550 --> 01:33:35,550
We're staging a coup

1163
01:33:35,550 --> 01:33:43,609
What is he talking about? What is he even talking about?

1164
01:33:46,109 --> 01:33:47,630
There's people

1165
01:33:47,630 --> 01:33:53,289
Never okay before we got a call a few times before we got on the call. What did you specifically ask me?

1166
01:33:54,350 --> 01:33:55,630
if what

1167
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:58,029
If what if I was going to what?

1168
01:33:59,479 --> 01:34:01,609
be

1169
01:34:01,609 --> 01:34:02,810
What was it?

1170
01:34:02,810 --> 01:34:06,970
I wanted to make sure you weren't going to ruin my fun gameplay session by being silly

1171
01:34:07,369 --> 01:34:09,850
Okay, being like weird and being silly. Yeah

1172
01:34:10,649 --> 01:34:16,109
You're talking about like people in your head speaking to you and like then you just talked about like uganda

1173
01:34:19,449 --> 01:34:32,560
What take your own advice was that no that wasn't you all right when you win the mission

1174
01:34:44,779 --> 01:34:47,899
There's someone like there's like a like an orchestra on my head

1175
01:34:48,619 --> 01:34:50,619
Like gospel singing

1176
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:53,020
I can't get it to stop. It just keeps

1177
01:34:59,439 --> 01:35:03,680
We could start a band, uh, all right, hold on I think we might have a third player here

1178
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:07,079
possible

1179
01:35:07,079 --> 01:35:09,500
It's possible

1180
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:13,739
Possible third player everybody. Yeah, well, let me go pee and see if there's a possible third player

1181
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:17,100
All right. I'm gonna figure out this. Uh, you figure out your computer

1182
01:35:18,430 --> 01:35:22,430
I can figure out my computer. Okay, and don't mute yourself because you have to you have to like

1183
01:35:23,229 --> 01:35:28,750
Make sure people on my stream can hear you because like i'm leaving so i'm don't mute you yourself. You need to talk

1184
01:35:29,789 --> 01:35:37,479
Okay. Bye. I'll be right back. Okay. Can can I download and install new nvidia drivers while streaming without any problems?

1185
01:35:41,770 --> 01:35:44,220
also

1186
01:35:44,220 --> 01:35:49,020
Why like why do you always need a new driver? Why can't they just use the same one?

1187
01:35:49,819 --> 01:35:56,250
Like my computer used to work if this if this were the problem

1188
01:35:57,050 --> 01:36:15,869
You know what i'm saying?

1189
01:36:15,949 --> 01:36:19,390
He's also by the way drama never he doesn't get t

1190
01:36:20,189 --> 01:36:25,359
Well, I can hear myself. Oh god

1191
01:36:25,439 --> 01:36:28,649
No

1192
01:36:28,649 --> 01:36:35,310
There's voices in my head

1193
01:36:35,310 --> 01:36:36,989
it might be

1194
01:36:36,989 --> 01:36:37,630
I was thinking too

1195
01:36:37,630 --> 01:36:40,029
I had the same problem when I was playing the soul calibers and it was

1196
01:36:40,170 --> 01:36:43,470
Disconnecting like every 10 minutes and I thought it was a hitbox problem, but it's not

1197
01:36:44,270 --> 01:36:46,430
It's not plugged in. No, it's not plugged in

1198
01:36:47,390 --> 01:36:52,270
Oh, you know what? My twitch chat is always right. You're right. It's because I have spotify open

1199
01:36:53,310 --> 01:37:00,300

1200
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:03,420

Discord is a good program

1231
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:33,770

Just invite him over all the time so you can do your painting streams. So maybe you should keep track of where he is

1258
01:41:20,829 --> 01:41:28,140
What's so funny

1259
01:41:28,140 --> 01:41:33,100
It's not funny from the other perspective where you have to like watch other people be friends from like outside your window

1260
01:41:35,359 --> 01:41:37,359
I I don't know. I can't invite him

1261
01:41:46,619 --> 01:41:48,619

Wow, i'm not sure who you pick who who did you pick for a class italics? What's your class?

1306
01:45:37,449 --> 01:45:40,750

1307
01:45:41,710 --> 01:45:45,000

1308
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:52,329
Well, you're the scout

1312
01:46:09,789 --> 01:46:11,789
I don't know if you're doing this too

1313
01:46:11,949 --> 01:46:14,670
Why what are you talking about? What do you mean? What am I talking about?

1314

01:46:25,609 --> 01:46:27,609
But he's not here. He's he's

1317
01:46:27,609 --> 01:46:32,380
We're being manipulated

1318
01:46:32,380 --> 01:46:39,039
Yeah, all right. Let's go

1319
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:57,840
You died again

1320
01:47:02,159 --> 01:47:04,159
Oh my god

1321
01:47:09,239 --> 01:47:21,310
Yes, oh look it's a fortnight orc we're we're gonna be fine

1322
01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:34,720
What hey guys, what's up, I don't know who's talking

1323
01:47:42,199 --> 01:47:44,199
It was a copy pasta

1324
01:47:44,439 --> 01:47:55,720
Oh, can you heal me watch out come on italic he's just standing here

1325
01:47:57,720 --> 01:48:00,279
Maybe

1326
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:15,180
I'm so confused right now. All right, let me

1327
01:48:17,319 --> 01:48:22,119
You definitely i'm mapping this right now you're freaking out he's like I got a pressure to get it mapped quick

1328
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:25,079
There's too much going on. I don't even know who to shoot first

1329
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:31,899
Yes

1330
01:48:31,899 --> 01:48:33,899
Is anyone playing this game?

1331
01:48:33,899 --> 01:48:38,430
You can die

1332
01:48:42,489 --> 01:48:45,529
Hey, we're in a safe zone with the turrets. Hey guys, what's up?

1333
01:48:46,329 --> 01:48:48,890
I'm gonna lose my fucking mind

1334
01:48:50,729 --> 01:48:55,920
We got a sniper over here

1335
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:58,560
It's actually way too bad that I I need to go back

1336
01:48:59,609 --> 01:49:02,569
I had a ronnie soundboard too. Oh, did you really?

1337
01:49:03,529 --> 01:49:05,369
Don't have it. I checked

1338
01:49:05,369 --> 01:49:07,369
I like didn't save any of them

1339
01:49:10,079 --> 01:49:12,880
We need to get the the more kite which is

1340
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:18,239
The blue the navy blue stuff on the sides. I'm not sure how I feel about that

1341
01:49:19,199 --> 01:49:23,470
Should we just kill him?

1342
01:49:23,470 --> 01:49:26,989
I mean like we should probably just kill him like like I got my sights on him right now

1343
01:49:27,789 --> 01:49:29,840
Don't do it

1344
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:31,840
I'm not sure he's fired the gun

1345
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:36,359
But he doesn't need to

1346
01:49:36,359 --> 01:49:42,720
This is easy. We're only in hazard four. Oh, it's time to fight the boss

1347
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:46,399
Wait, that was a real voice

1348
01:49:47,359 --> 01:49:49,359
That that's not

1349
01:50:00,909 --> 01:50:03,489
Look, okay. I'm hitting left bumper. This is what's happening

1350
01:50:05,550 --> 01:50:07,550
He's on a controller

1351
01:50:08,569 --> 01:50:18,590
That's why

1352
01:50:18,590 --> 01:50:20,590
Okay, I need some sugar

1353
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:23,880
I need some sugar right now

1354
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:26,800
I'm, not sure he's fired the gun

1355
01:50:31,770 --> 01:50:33,770
All right. Whoa something

1356
01:50:34,250 --> 01:50:38,810
something

1357
01:50:38,810 --> 01:50:43,609
Yes, oh you're killing the you're killing the the the brain I think the brain

1358
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:49,880
I I stuck a bunch of needles in it

1359
01:50:50,539 --> 01:50:52,060
I'm gonna duck

1360
01:50:52,060 --> 01:50:53,500
I was a little spider

1361
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:58,399
I'm trying to take a game that we played together seriously for once and all you want to do is stop and make jokes

1362
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:06,750
Seriously, i've been looking forward to playing this game for like two months

1363
01:51:10,060 --> 01:51:14,779
You really have wanted to play this for a long time too. And now all I get are these jokers in here

1364
01:51:15,100 --> 01:51:17,100
No, I didn't do anything

1365
01:51:18,079 --> 01:51:21,119
I'm playing that i'm the one that's playing the game right now

1366
01:51:22,409 --> 01:51:25,930
Is there a kill feed

1367
01:51:25,930 --> 01:51:29,310
No, how could this game not have a kill feed?

1368
01:51:43,359 --> 01:51:45,359
There's punches over here come get some

1369
01:51:47,390 --> 01:51:54,380
gold

1370
01:51:54,380 --> 01:51:58,140
Also, this is where scout gets really useful. It wasn't someone playing scout. Are we all dead?

1371
01:51:58,699 --> 01:52:00,859
Yeah, you're the only person that remains fuck

1372
01:52:01,659 --> 01:52:06,699
Who's in this hole?

1373
01:52:06,699 --> 01:52:08,779
Oh, he's stuck to it. I'm dead

1374
01:52:10,510 --> 01:52:12,029
Wait, wait

1375
01:52:12,029 --> 01:52:14,350
He's alive. No, he's not. No, he's not

1376
01:52:14,989 --> 01:52:16,989
Can we just play the game?

1377
01:52:18,430 --> 01:52:19,800
You know

1378
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:22,119
Really pisses me off when people accuse me of lying

1379
01:52:25,739 --> 01:52:28,380
Should I go like into his room and like turn it off?

1380
01:52:38,670 --> 01:52:40,670
Go into his room and cut his mic

1381
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:47,880
Maybe

1382
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:52,699
Turn off this cut. I should unplug his I should unplug his router

1383
01:52:54,539 --> 01:53:00,840
I'm gonna go unplug his router guys. That's my router too. That's not how I can't do that

1384
01:53:03,100 --> 01:53:05,100
Okay, we're going in again

1385
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:10,640
I need full focus

1386
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:12,960
From everyone. All right. Let me just buy some stuff first

1387
01:53:13,439 --> 01:53:19,119
I'm taking this one dead seriously, but I can I can I can afford something. No, I can't I don't have I need to level up

1388
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:22,619
There we go

1389
01:53:22,619 --> 01:53:24,619
Flare last longer. Sure. I'll take it

1390
01:53:25,739 --> 01:53:28,159
I thought that was another sign board. I am so

1391
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:31,680
Fucking paranoid about everything being soundboard that I don't know

1392
01:53:33,609 --> 01:53:35,609
What what what's there to be paranoid about?

1393
01:53:36,090 --> 01:53:38,090
I don't know you tell me

1394
01:53:38,729 --> 01:53:40,729
I'm gonna go unplug his router

1395
01:53:40,970 --> 01:53:42,970
Wait, am I going alone? What?

1396
01:53:46,699 --> 01:53:48,699
You were more concerned

1397
01:53:48,779 --> 01:53:49,979
about

1398
01:53:49,979 --> 01:53:54,300
Fucking doing that stupid soundboard and now wait, oh, yeah, I think we're good

1399
01:53:54,859 --> 01:53:59,579
Yeah, I think I brought everybody but I was worried because I was in the ship alone and I just saw myself dropping

1400
01:54:00,220 --> 01:54:02,779
My stomach can't take it. I'm gonna go I'm fucking

1401
01:54:09,659 --> 01:54:12,140
Hey guys, what's up? Oh my fucking god

1402
01:54:12,779 --> 01:54:15,369
Oh

1403
01:54:15,369 --> 01:54:17,930
I can't okay. I can't take this

1404
01:54:18,729 --> 01:54:26,010
Oh, are you are you drill guy? I am drill. I've been drill guy. I'm always drill guy. It's a drill wall drill wall

1405
01:54:28,680 --> 01:54:31,159
You gotta find the thing. Oh, i'm looking for the purples

1406
01:54:38,039 --> 01:54:40,279
Right, I don't see

1407
01:54:41,739 --> 01:54:46,380
Oh, maybe i'm wrong down. Yeah, I think this might just be a common rock area

1408
01:54:46,939 --> 01:54:48,939
down

1409
01:54:49,899 --> 01:54:51,899
I don't know. I don't think this might be one

1410
01:54:55,739 --> 01:54:57,180
I don't see anything

1411
01:54:57,180 --> 01:55:03,500
What the heck is this?

1412
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:08,010
I don't know. I don't think i've been to this environment

1413
01:55:09,819 --> 01:55:11,640
Maybe I have

1414
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:13,640
A long time. What about these? What about the blue?

1415
01:55:16,329 --> 01:55:18,329
Okay, we got to get more kite

1416
01:55:19,199 --> 01:55:21,949
And yeah, yep

1417
01:55:23,949 --> 01:55:25,949
Stop singing

1418
01:55:26,359 --> 01:55:28,359
One mission is all I ask

1419
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:35,520
You're going you're going home soon like you're not gonna be able to play again i'm gonna miss you dude

1420
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:42,319
At least I got

1421
01:55:42,319 --> 01:55:44,319
Jolly rancher. All right

1422
01:55:44,729 --> 01:55:48,810
Back when army of two came out my college roommates and sweet mates were way too into

1423
01:55:53,020 --> 01:55:54,779
Cut his mic

1424
01:55:54,779 --> 01:55:59,979
Cut his mic

1425
01:55:59,979 --> 01:56:04,409
This way friends

1426
01:56:04,409 --> 01:56:07,930
This two this two scouts both yelling in different directions

1427
01:56:12,970 --> 01:56:18,250
No, maybe I shouldn't be following the scout that's standing still in the wall press control

1428
01:56:18,729 --> 01:56:29,960
That's the pro tip

1429
01:56:29,960 --> 01:56:32,119
I go into his room and he's not even in there

1430
01:56:34,359 --> 01:56:35,800
Hold on a second

1431
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:53,979
He's not in his room

1432
01:56:55,930 --> 01:56:58,090
This he's not at his desk. There's nobody there

1433
01:57:05,770 --> 01:57:07,770
Are you controlling him? Are you?

1434
01:57:08,489 --> 01:57:12,569
No

1435
01:57:12,569 --> 01:57:15,020
Where am I?

1436
01:57:15,020 --> 01:57:18,460
Uh, no one no one is like can we please please?

1437
01:57:19,100 --> 01:57:20,989

1438
01:57:20,989 --> 01:57:22,989
gamers

1439
01:57:26,090 --> 01:57:27,609
All right, let's go

1440
01:57:27,609 --> 01:57:30,680
We're gonna go up. What do you want to go through?

1441
01:57:36,090 --> 01:57:41,210
Drill not working. Oh, there's a bug you're getting caught on

1442
01:57:46,250 --> 01:57:49,369
Dude, I think please I I I can't drill through this

1443
01:57:50,409 --> 01:57:56,409
Dude, it's not my fault that italics is at like a mcdonald's wi-fi right now pretending that he's here. I can't go through this

1444
01:57:57,369 --> 01:57:59,369
I can't go through this

1445
01:58:00,329 --> 01:58:02,329
Use your fucking pick

1446
01:58:09,399 --> 01:58:11,399
I'm so sick of goofs

1447
01:58:14,359 --> 01:58:16,039
All right, we can move

1448
01:58:16,039 --> 01:58:22,359
Oh acid acid pool acid pool acid pool acid pool

1449
01:58:25,770 --> 01:58:46,039
What is it? Hey, can I get a closer look? This would be a lot easier if we had a driller

1450
01:58:46,760 --> 01:58:48,279
I

1451
01:58:48,279 --> 01:58:52,840
You saw what happened to me. I drilled and fell down into an acid pool

1452
01:58:53,159 --> 01:58:55,079
I told you I thought you said again

1453
01:58:55,159 --> 01:58:59,479
I thought you told me that there was no minecraft like dig down into the lava scenarios in this game

1454
01:59:00,039 --> 01:59:01,979
That just happened

1455
01:59:02,060 --> 01:59:16,729
I lied can we get some can we get some support? There's a bunch of like flesh-colored fighters on me

1456
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:30,039
Hey guys, what's up? It's okay. I've been live for two hours. I feel like i've been live for 40

1457
01:59:33,119 --> 01:59:35,119
Uh, I burned another bridge

1458
01:59:39,680 --> 01:59:41,680
I don't think i'm gonna play with him anymore

1459
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:49,880
I checked he wasn't in the other room

1460
01:59:51,050 --> 01:59:54,010
He's simulated. I don't want to play with starting one man. He like

1461
01:59:55,529 --> 01:59:57,689
He fucking simulated one of my friends

1462
02:00:05,550 --> 02:00:07,550
Shut up

1463
02:00:10,859 --> 02:00:14,489
I didn't know we were all dead

1464
02:00:14,489 --> 02:00:16,890
I need a recording of italic saying like i'm down

1465
02:00:23,500 --> 02:00:25,840
I'm gonna scour hours of youtube content

1466
02:00:32,239 --> 02:00:35,039
Hey, i'm pinned down over here. Are you even playing? Okay

1467
02:00:36,720 --> 02:00:38,649
We can handle

1468
02:00:38,649 --> 02:00:42,489
Let's just never talk about this mission. All right, we're doing it again. That'll work

1469
02:00:43,529 --> 02:00:45,470
That'll work

1470
02:00:45,470 --> 02:00:47,789
That's good enough for me. I think yeah

1471
02:00:48,510 --> 02:00:50,029
That'll work

1472
02:00:50,029 --> 02:01:00,119
Well, not time to leave. I need to upgrade my weapons. You can't I need to get better drills barb drills

1473
02:01:04,510 --> 02:01:08,479

1474
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:18,329
uh

1475
02:01:18,329 --> 02:01:21,069
barb drills

1476
02:01:21,069 --> 02:01:23,069
Who has the worst computer?

1477
02:01:23,710 --> 02:01:26,909
Right now it's a tight race between lemon law and ronnie. Oh

1478
02:01:36,939 --> 02:01:42,220
I was gonna say every time that it's quiet for like 15 to 20 straight seconds. It means that like the two sound board boys

1479
02:01:42,779 --> 02:01:43,819
are

1480
02:01:43,819 --> 02:01:46,489
Queuing up more

1481
02:01:46,489 --> 02:01:51,069
What every time that every time you guys are quiet for more than 10 seconds

1482
02:01:51,069 --> 02:01:55,880
It means like here comes more sound effects. Yes

1483
02:01:56,840 --> 02:01:58,300
Yes

1484
02:01:58,300 --> 02:01:59,420
No

1485
02:01:59,420 --> 02:02:00,859
I'm breaking out

1486
02:02:00,859 --> 02:02:02,859
I'm breaking free

1487
02:02:03,260 --> 02:02:05,260
Oh, this chip was in my neck

1488
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:11,439
It was a computer chip in my neck. It's blood

1489
02:02:12,479 --> 02:02:16,640
Can we uh, can we all just ignore the blood for like one second and get a drill guy over on the dirt?

1490
02:02:18,079 --> 02:02:20,079
I'm a drill guy. What do you need?

1491
02:02:21,789 --> 02:02:24,250
What?

1492
02:02:24,250 --> 02:02:31,289
Who the fuck was that?

1493
02:02:31,289 --> 02:02:33,850
Did you turn italics into another person?

1494
02:02:35,640 --> 02:02:46,220
good times

1495
02:02:46,220 --> 02:02:49,840
I can't have italics. I'll just replace him. All right

1496
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:56,859
All right, here we go

1497
02:02:58,640 --> 02:03:11,130
Bugs

1498
02:03:11,130 --> 02:03:16,010
I can't tell if that was a sound board or somebody actually just hurt themselves. Oh

1499
02:03:18,439 --> 02:03:22,539
The stream doesn't feel real

1500
02:03:22,779 --> 02:03:24,779
I'm not sure he's fired

1501
02:03:26,250 --> 02:03:27,369
I know

1502
02:03:27,369 --> 02:03:29,369
I i'm right there with you

1503
02:03:29,689 --> 02:03:32,890
It's so messed up when you get cut off from talking by yourself

1504
02:03:33,850 --> 02:03:38,890
Like you can't finish your thought I can't finish my sentence because i'm cutting myself off

1505
02:03:39,529 --> 02:03:42,170
It was so funny because it was like it feels like you're so polite

1506
02:03:42,489 --> 02:03:46,729
You can't interrupt yourself. You like give yourself the time to talk, but it's not even real

1507
02:03:50,399 --> 02:04:00,970
Four

1508
02:04:00,970 --> 02:04:02,970
Wait, what's what's the dog?

1509
02:04:03,050 --> 02:04:05,210
Is somebody a dog? Hey, all right

1510
02:04:06,170 --> 02:04:12,010
That's awfully suspiciously the same bark over and over again. Is that even a real dog computer and might have just woke me up

1511
02:04:12,489 --> 02:04:15,500

Kind of hey, no spoilers

1633
02:14:17,800 --> 02:14:19,800
No spoiler. That's how he talks

1634
02:14:20,359 --> 02:14:26,039
That part yet. You haven't gotten to the part where jora mormon talks. Well, you haven't seen

1635
02:14:26,680 --> 02:14:29,319
You're on like episode four of the first season. Okay

02:14:30,600 --> 02:14:32,600

1637
02:14:37,630 --> 02:14:40,189
Can I get some help? Yeah, he's in the first episode

1638
02:14:42,060 --> 02:14:44,060
What he's the one that falls out the window?

1639
02:14:45,399 --> 02:14:48,920
Yeah, you all right. You're tracking on kind of uncharted ground here

1640
02:14:49,739 --> 02:14:51,739
You you be careful here

1641
02:14:52,619 --> 02:14:54,640
Careful what?

1642
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:56,720
I'm the one that doesn't want the spoilers

1643
02:14:57,520 --> 02:15:09,869
Where we need to go up?

1644
02:15:09,869 --> 02:15:11,869
Where is everybody we're going like up

1645
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:15,800
In the worst possible way

1646
02:15:17,720 --> 02:15:20,439

1647
02:15:21,319 --> 02:15:23,800
No, no, no, that's it's my that's my clip. That's my video

1648
02:15:25,260 --> 02:15:27,979
Please no, please. I need that. I just need to fill this out

1649
02:15:28,140 --> 02:15:33,020

But I get the dollar shave club

1653
02:15:41,069 --> 02:15:42,720
All right, homie

1654
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:47,119

1656
02:15:52,029 --> 02:15:53,710

1657
02:15:53,710 --> 02:15:55,710
I do once every three years

1658
02:15:56,189 --> 02:16:00,989
And they are not spider-man three what's plays. That's too bad. You're missing out

1659
02:16:02,029 --> 02:16:06,060
Is that why gta 5 so popular right now?

1660
02:16:07,630 --> 02:16:11,310
I don't know because it takes you back to the yester years in 2015 when things were good

1661
02:16:11,630 --> 02:16:14,109
I think just gta rps is fun and people like it

1662
02:16:15,069 --> 02:16:23,050
So what we're to look we need uh, we're looking for you missed. Uh, you missed a secret I did

1667
02:16:35,790 --> 02:16:36,909
Yeah

1668
02:16:36,909 --> 02:16:40,170
What is that out right here? I got it

1669
02:16:42,139 --> 02:16:46,040
Uh, it's not there

1670
02:16:46,040 --> 02:16:59,930
It's not here

1671
02:16:59,930 --> 02:17:01,930
Not over here

1672
02:17:02,489 --> 02:17:04,489
Swarm swarm

1673
02:17:04,809 --> 02:17:06,329
Swarm

1674
02:17:06,329 --> 02:17:20,319
Did you just drill can you drill like a straight line so we can retreat?

1675
02:17:21,680 --> 02:17:23,680
Please i'm going i'm going i'm going

1676
02:17:24,319 --> 02:17:26,319
And you're going through like toxic gas

1677
02:17:26,639 --> 02:17:30,000
What?

1678
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:31,120
There's a hole

1679
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:43,020
Okay, I gotta I gotta escape her

1680
02:17:43,100 --> 02:17:48,649
Wow, that was that was some teamwork. I'm using this clip if you got the last one

1681
02:17:48,649 --> 02:17:53,129
I'm getting this one, but that that was me doing that though. That was like my perspective is like more interesting

1682
02:17:53,690 --> 02:17:55,690
Because i'm the one drilling

1683
02:17:55,850 --> 02:17:57,850
What's this for my review?

1684
02:18:00,430 --> 02:18:09,319
Uh, that need help pops

1685
02:18:09,799 --> 02:18:11,799
What's the pop? What's the what's the pops?

1686
02:18:12,440 --> 02:18:18,680
Are we dead?

1687
02:18:18,680 --> 02:18:20,600
Some of you look dead

1688
02:18:20,600 --> 02:18:22,430
I think

1689
02:18:22,430 --> 02:18:24,670
We are dead

1690
02:18:24,670 --> 02:18:27,360
I'll get you guys. Don't worry

1691
02:18:27,440 --> 02:18:28,959
He told me to drill a hole

1692
02:18:28,959 --> 02:18:30,959
And they just kind of filled the hole

1693
02:18:31,280 --> 02:18:36,159
Well, if alex didn't come with us because he was too busy making the jokes first of all, I was with somebody

1694
02:18:36,159 --> 02:18:38,559
So if I was with somebody then that means two of us

1695
02:18:39,280 --> 02:18:40,879
You were with ronnie

1696
02:18:40,879 --> 02:18:42,879
And ronnie can't hear what we're saying

1697
02:18:44,079 --> 02:18:47,600
Oh, right. Is that why he's been yelling for help in the chat?

1698
02:18:48,639 --> 02:18:50,559
Ronnie can't hear us

1699
02:18:50,559 --> 02:18:54,000
Is that why he wrote help, uh, 10 times in the chat? Yes, that's why

1700
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:58,639
To anyone watching this youtube video, please help. How do I t-bag?

1701
02:19:12,719 --> 02:19:14,319
No

1702
02:19:14,319 --> 02:19:16,319
No, ah

1703
02:19:18,920 --> 02:19:20,680
I'm dead. I'm down again

1704
02:19:20,680 --> 02:19:26,350
That's okay

1705
02:19:26,350 --> 02:19:31,709
Did aiming did you reviving me give you tamp a handful time to run away while I absorbed everybody?

1706
02:19:34,090 --> 02:19:35,639
Well

1707
02:19:35,639 --> 02:19:37,819
This is what scouts good at

1708
02:19:37,819 --> 02:19:49,930
You can read more about it in the review. I'm just gonna like not revive germa this time

1709
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:54,799
You revived me and ran away. Well, it's like 10 bugs attacked me

1710
02:19:57,579 --> 02:19:59,579
Uh, I can't shoot

1711
02:19:59,899 --> 02:20:05,450
They had ammo we might need to get a supply crate

1712
02:20:10,200 --> 02:20:12,569
Uh, you don't have enough nitro. I don't think

1713
02:20:15,450 --> 02:20:17,450
Thank you for using the sprinkles on me

1714
02:20:18,159 --> 02:20:23,760
If you have nitro, please deposit it because we were very close to the allotted amount required to call in

1715
02:20:24,159 --> 02:20:27,680
The drop-on which is going to apply you with additional ammo

1716
02:20:28,479 --> 02:20:30,479
All right. Well, where are we gonna find this pearl? Don't we?

1717
02:20:34,319 --> 02:20:36,319
Was that before or after the dlc?

1718
02:20:37,559 --> 02:20:41,959
Uh, it's actually entirely, uh start to finish free to play

1719
02:20:43,319 --> 02:20:46,010
Uh, it's not true. This game's like 30 bucks

1720
02:20:46,729 --> 02:20:48,729

1727
02:21:13,469 --> 02:21:15,469
And can we please turn in some nitrate?

1728
02:21:16,440 --> 02:21:18,440
What I just heard the thing break? Oh, it's right there

02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:27,579

02:21:32,780 --> 02:21:36,090
What do I do with this?

1733
02:21:36,090 --> 02:21:38,250
Uh, we gotta get the supply wagon thing

1734
02:21:43,610 --> 02:21:45,610
You're gonna put it in this thing and we get some

1735
02:21:46,250 --> 02:21:51,850
Stuff wait, where you going? Why wait, wait, wait, where you going? Get back here me. No. No, it's a stupid thing

1736
02:21:53,129 --> 02:21:55,690
Oh, it might be following me press v

1737
02:21:55,850 --> 02:21:57,850
I did

1738
02:21:58,090 --> 02:22:05,450
enemies

1739
02:22:18,479 --> 02:22:27,479
Much as I can do

1740
02:22:27,479 --> 02:22:30,120
I swear who has the nitro?

1741
02:22:31,639 --> 02:22:33,639
One of you have it I do

1742
02:22:34,649 --> 02:22:36,010
Turn it in

1743
02:22:36,010 --> 02:22:37,690
turn it in

1744
02:22:37,690 --> 02:22:38,729
where

1745
02:22:38,729 --> 02:22:41,870
Where it's right there. There it is

1746
02:22:41,870 --> 02:22:43,870
Inside the moving loop great

1747
02:22:44,670 --> 02:22:45,790
All right

1748
02:22:45,790 --> 02:22:48,479
I I think that

1749
02:22:51,530 --> 02:22:56,889
Over here on the yellow thing there is a device that comes out that gives you extra money

1750
02:23:03,360 --> 02:23:05,360
I get this clip

1751
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:07,600
No, that's mine. I'm the one that did it

1752
02:23:09,979 --> 02:23:13,180
If you put that in your video, i'm gonna be fucking really mad. Don't do that

1753
02:23:13,340 --> 02:23:17,020
I made that funny joke and I dropped it on him and I knew I made I did the funny

1754
02:23:17,020 --> 02:23:20,299
Eehaw eehaw thing. I would hate to get my oh my lawyers involved in this one

1755
02:23:26,920 --> 02:23:30,120
Ladies and gentlemen, we have the prelude to what would ultimately become

1756
02:23:30,840 --> 02:23:36,840
Recording without telling the people you're playing with that you're recording so that no clips would need be shared

1757
02:23:37,319 --> 02:23:39,719
And all would belong to the clipper

1758
02:23:40,680 --> 02:23:42,920
It's pretty good strategy actually

1759
02:23:45,239 --> 02:23:47,479
Natalix, did you uh level up your

1760
02:23:47,959 --> 02:23:50,760
Inside of your weapon to be able to shoot things out of it

1761
02:23:52,840 --> 02:23:54,840
What did you get ammo

1762
02:23:55,479 --> 02:23:57,479
Did you did you get ammo?

1763
02:23:59,639 --> 02:24:01,239
Make sure you get ammo

1764
02:24:01,239 --> 02:24:05,000
I got ammo. Nice. All right. Are you guys ready? I need ammo. Did we put the um

1765
02:24:05,879 --> 02:24:08,780
Did you put the the the jade thing in there?

1766
02:24:13,549 --> 02:24:18,270
What did you put the we put the jade in there the thing that the the secret gem in the wall?

1767
02:24:19,069 --> 02:24:28,620
The secret gem that we dug out of the wall was put in the supply drop, right following somebody who's good at this game

1768
02:24:29,020 --> 02:24:30,620
You following me?

1769
02:24:30,620 --> 02:24:32,940
Then oh, so the answer is no. No, the answer is yeah

1770
02:24:34,200 --> 02:24:36,379
The heck is this?

1771
02:24:36,379 --> 02:24:38,239
we're looking for

1772
02:24:38,239 --> 02:24:43,200
The blue the navy blue. Oh, by the way f if you want to throw out a some light

1773
02:24:44,799 --> 02:24:46,799
You can just do that. Hey

1774
02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:51,280
Driller control

1775
02:24:52,239 --> 02:24:55,680
Mouse button is grenade you need me to do what you need to dig split dig spot

1776
02:24:56,559 --> 02:24:58,559

What is it guys? What is he doing? I'm digging to you

1778
02:25:12,350 --> 02:25:15,629
I'm seeing i'm seeing f in the chat. What do you f?

1779
02:25:19,180 --> 02:25:21,420
This is some red faction one stuff we're doing right here

1780
02:25:22,219 --> 02:25:24,219
Why would yeah, I want to replay that

1781
02:25:24,940 --> 02:25:26,940
One of these days you're just really far away

1782
02:25:28,329 --> 02:25:31,129
Okay, far 20 meters for a drill guy

1783
02:25:31,930 --> 02:25:37,549
I can't overheat this i'm right above you

1784
02:25:40,219 --> 02:25:40,940
Hey

1785
02:25:40,940 --> 02:25:42,139
I made it

1786
02:25:42,139 --> 02:25:47,100
Okay, there's the hole we're going but a swarm's coming. Oh that actually worked

1787
02:25:47,979 --> 02:25:50,799
Press f he doesn't know

1788
02:25:52,319 --> 02:25:55,200
I don't understand what the doubts what do we not know?

1789
02:25:57,389 --> 02:25:59,389
Uh, I think what is running?

1790

What do we not know? Oh, we're asking chat. What do we not know? Yeah, what do we not know?

1791
02:26:03,629 --> 02:26:10,639
So

1792
02:26:10,639 --> 02:26:13,920
I think we know everything we need to know. That's why half these people still in school

1793
02:26:14,639 --> 02:26:17,209
They don't

1794
02:26:17,209 --> 02:26:19,209
Uh, it's two o'clock

1795
02:26:19,290 --> 02:26:25,959
What are you talking about?

1796
02:26:25,959 --> 02:26:30,040

Never mind why not never mind. You're gonna ask me and take my shirt off again. We're here

1801
02:26:47,260 --> 02:27:00,620
Something in the water just I could just snipe running. That was me

Just grapple around

1811
02:27:40,090 --> 02:27:44,639
We got so much of that ore over here. This would be so bad if you lose this

1812
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:47,600
Come on, man. You're like one of the top players

1813
02:27:51,309 --> 02:27:55,629
Show us again why everyone considers you to be like the good gamer

1814
02:27:56,270 --> 02:27:59,399
I got no ammo

1815
02:27:59,399 --> 02:28:09,450
You don't have any ammo at all zero

1816
02:28:10,250 --> 02:28:11,209
i've got

1817
02:28:11,209 --> 02:28:12,889

02:28:12,889 --> 02:28:14,649
Make them count two

1819
02:28:14,649 --> 02:28:21,520
Um, they're all cramming up this hole. I don't remember which way to actually go

1820
02:28:22,159 --> 02:28:35,930
This is the wrong way

1821
02:28:35,930 --> 02:28:41,450
Holy shit, you can go very far with that thing, huh? I'm getting edf. I have it upgraded pretty far

1822
02:28:42,889 --> 02:28:44,889

02:28:45,530 --> 02:28:56,860
Here's the hole. What are those like?

1824

Deku nuts coming out of your like face when you fly

1825
02:29:00,139 --> 02:29:02,139

1833
02:29:39,420 --> 02:29:45,739
On a platform with no money exists. Here's the dumbest thing about youtube. You could probably fucking get away with that

1834
02:29:46,860 --> 02:29:48,379
somehow

1835
02:29:48,379 --> 02:29:54,219

1837
02:29:59,739 --> 02:30:01,739

02:30:01,739 --> 02:30:07,120
Had a video claimed it was like scout hand upward live commentary

1839
02:30:08,139 --> 02:30:13,899

1840
02:30:15,180 --> 02:30:16,379
Yeah

1841
02:30:16,379 --> 02:30:25,370

1842
02:30:25,370 --> 02:30:27,850
Uh, you know what we need is is more nitro though

1843
02:30:30,120 --> 02:30:32,280
Because I have just happened no ammo

1844
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,120

1861
02:31:49,120 --> 02:31:51,120
Where where is what do you mean dirt down there?

1862
02:31:54,299 --> 02:31:58,620
Where are you? I mean over there compact dirt that leaves the next area

1863
02:31:58,700 --> 02:32:00,700
We need to get through because there's like no nitro here

1864
02:32:01,579 --> 02:32:10,270
How did you get down there? How did I get down there? No, how star? Where the hell are you?

02:32:30,379 --> 02:32:32,620
No, you're not

1870
02:32:37,950 --> 02:32:39,469
Like a dickhead

1871
02:32:39,469 --> 02:32:43,049
I hear something

1872
02:32:43,049 --> 02:32:45,049
You're going the complete opposite way

1873
02:33:03,040 --> 02:33:08,159
I'm with you. Let's do this. Let's do this lemon long. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die

1874
02:33:09,200 --> 02:33:11,200
Do you have ammo a little bit?

1878
02:33:28,719 --> 02:33:32,799
Touch it

1879
02:33:32,799 --> 02:33:34,379

Shout i'm just i'm going down this path

1882
02:33:39,180 --> 02:33:49,149
Looking for nitro

1883
02:33:49,149 --> 02:33:52,829
Good question. How come one of these games hasn't done like a voice pack like that

1884
02:33:53,790 --> 02:33:55,760
like what

1885
02:33:55,760 --> 02:33:59,520
You know non-serious like tuber boys

1886
02:34:00,479 --> 02:34:02,079
you mean like

1887
02:34:02,079 --> 02:34:03,840
the dota voice packs

1888
02:34:03,840 --> 02:34:05,840
Star like hiroth smite

1889
02:34:06,399 --> 02:34:09,659
Start with our hiroth smite is uh

1890
02:34:10,459 --> 02:34:12,940
Sorry, but did you want a voice pack? Um

1891
02:34:13,979 --> 02:34:17,180
Open the wallet and turn it upside down. Which one did you want?

1892
02:34:20,989 --> 02:34:22,989
Star, where are you?

1893
02:34:24,829 --> 02:34:27,549
I need to know oh, I need to constantly know where you are

1894
02:34:30,969 --> 02:34:32,969
I'm running back to our friends

1895
02:34:33,129 --> 02:34:35,500
You're going back

1896
02:34:35,500 --> 02:34:37,020
You're going back there

1897
02:34:37,020 --> 02:34:37,979
Yeah

1898
02:34:37,979 --> 02:34:53,069
All right. I'm like above you

1899
02:34:54,829 --> 02:35:02,299
Oh god

1900
02:35:02,299 --> 02:35:04,540
Can you dig up? Can you dig up for me? Can you dig up?

1901
02:35:05,819 --> 02:35:07,709
dig up

1902
02:35:07,709 --> 02:35:09,709
I'm dead. I'm good. I'm dead, too

1903
02:35:10,030 --> 02:35:14,750
I don't like I don't understand how there was only enough nitro to call in one supply drop

1904
02:35:15,309 --> 02:35:17,309
For like the first three areas

1905
02:35:28,090 --> 02:35:33,530
What is it is we have four people so it's 400 more hp and 400 less resources

1906
02:35:34,489 --> 02:35:35,920
Yeah

1907
02:35:35,920 --> 02:35:37,920
We have this dead weight

1908
02:35:40,139 --> 02:35:42,139
Ronnie's not even in the call. Why would you say that?

1909
02:35:42,700 --> 02:35:45,979
I feel like he's listening to all of the streams at once

1910
02:35:46,940 --> 02:35:48,940
Let's see if anyone mentions him

1911
02:35:51,629 --> 02:35:57,549
Uh, well, he is getting him in the call. He is communicating. He said bad in all capitals

1912
02:35:59,680 --> 02:36:04,379
He did say bad

1913
02:36:04,379 --> 02:36:10,879
Oh, I need 15 silver coins

1914
02:36:11,520 --> 02:36:25,129
Let's see the other characters

1915
02:36:25,129 --> 02:36:27,319
gunner engineer

1916
02:36:27,319 --> 02:36:28,200
gunner

1917
02:36:28,200 --> 02:36:32,940
I'll stay with the drill

1918
02:36:33,899 --> 02:36:35,899
Noob driller

1919
02:36:36,540 --> 02:36:41,389
Is it the new class? Whatever you pick

1920
02:36:50,219 --> 02:36:55,799
How come I can't go on the ship? Oh, I didn't take a mission

1921
02:36:58,489 --> 02:37:00,489
I feel like this is how you dance in vr

1922
02:37:03,229 --> 02:37:05,870
You don't want to move around that much because you don't want to bump into your walls

1923
02:37:12,239 --> 02:37:14,079
Dude I go nuts

1924
02:37:14,079 --> 02:37:24,170
You can't use your legs in vr. Yes, you can if you have trackers on them. Yeah, you just

1925
02:37:24,809 --> 02:37:28,090
They have the loops like the oculus controllers. You just stick your feet through the loop

1926
02:37:28,889 --> 02:37:31,200
And then you play with poor controllers

1927
02:37:34,459 --> 02:37:36,459
All right. Are we ready to we'll get this is

1928
02:37:36,700 --> 02:37:38,940
This is a pure gamer

1929
02:37:39,100 --> 02:37:43,040
Part of the level. Okay, I haven't won anything since i've been here. So i'll take responsibility

1930
02:37:44,059 --> 02:37:46,059
Yeah, congrats on level one

1931
02:37:46,540 --> 02:37:49,360
Yeah, i'm still level one

1932
02:37:49,360 --> 02:37:51,360
Remember when I said anything but scout

1933
02:37:52,489 --> 02:37:54,489
I didn't oh I didn't pick that

1934
02:37:57,930 --> 02:37:59,930
I didn't even go into my ship

1935
02:38:00,489 --> 02:38:02,489
These tough those beards are so huge

1936
02:38:08,239 --> 02:38:10,399
That's just like that's so much hair

1937
02:38:11,709 --> 02:38:15,709
I feel like I would trip on that here. Is there like a button in here that just takes us back to the base?

1938
02:38:15,790 --> 02:38:17,790
No, we're winning this

1939
02:38:18,639 --> 02:38:21,440
Mine that this is a simple mining mission. You got it

1940
02:38:32,649 --> 02:38:34,649
Does the drill work is a better miner?

1941
02:38:35,899 --> 02:38:37,899
Someone okay, who's hosting this?

1942
02:38:38,540 --> 02:38:44,120
How I was posting what me this my computer freaks out every 10 minutes and then the game freaks out

1943
02:38:44,520 --> 02:38:48,520
Because I just lagged off the clip. Yeah, that's happening. That's my fault

1944
02:38:49,319 --> 02:38:53,420
Okay, I got the uh gold

1945
02:38:53,420 --> 02:39:01,360
There we go. Okay, dig through the dirt dig through the dirt. Let's dig through this dirt

1946
02:39:02,159 --> 02:39:07,770
You gotta hustle you take too long. Then there's a million things

1947
02:39:08,409 --> 02:39:11,280
dig through dirt

1948
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:13,280
I doubt I've just planned. Okay

1949
02:39:13,360 --> 02:39:15,200
Going through the dirt. Wait

1950
02:39:15,200 --> 02:39:18,680
Okay

1951
02:39:18,680 --> 02:39:27,760
We're through i'm proud of you. Thanks, man

1952
02:39:28,319 --> 02:39:39,500
Okay

1953
02:39:39,500 --> 02:39:41,500
lick me

1954
02:39:43,020 --> 02:39:50,110
Why do you want to say something like that? Hey guys, what's up? Why can't you just say like

1955
02:39:50,909 --> 02:39:54,600
I don't know something like

1956
02:39:54,600 --> 02:39:58,760
Charge me. It's hard to think of something better to say right on the spot. You can't even think of anything

1957
02:39:58,760 --> 02:40:00,760
You're like, why don't you say? Um

1958
02:40:00,840 --> 02:40:02,840
Well, it's because I was looking at something

1959
02:40:03,340 --> 02:40:05,739
Yeah, i'm not afraid to share what my desires are

1960
02:40:06,700 --> 02:40:08,219
like some people

1961
02:40:08,219 --> 02:40:10,459
That are so bottled up

1962
02:40:10,459 --> 02:40:14,059
And taught by society that you're home supposed to you know, not be licked

1963
02:40:16,700 --> 02:40:22,329
But you do it anyway, right?

1964
02:40:22,969 --> 02:40:26,110
All right, you're killing one hit I did

1965
02:40:27,149 --> 02:40:29,149
All right. So now where are we going?

1966
02:40:30,270 --> 02:40:32,350
We need to extract

1967
02:40:32,350 --> 02:40:34,360
All right. There's uh this

1968
02:40:34,360 --> 02:40:38,079
crusty stuff here

1969
02:40:38,079 --> 02:40:42,319
I'm gonna dump the uh gold and the I got a lot of nitra and a lot of gold watch out spiders

1970
02:40:44,760 --> 02:40:46,760
Why what's with this broken game?

1971
02:40:47,479 --> 02:40:49,290
Okay, we're good

1972
02:40:49,290 --> 02:40:58,620
I want that. Uh, right killed in one hit

1973
02:40:59,260 --> 02:41:05,790
Now we got a lot of gold in there a lot of uh nitro

1974
02:41:09,180 --> 02:41:11,739
I'll scout ahead as the class name implies

1975
02:41:12,299 --> 02:41:15,979
Hey, i'll come with you. Yeah, let's stick together stick together. There's no reason for us to split up right?

1976
02:41:16,780 --> 02:41:21,500
Don't like don't split up because you're the gamer star and you'd like to go forward really fast

1977
02:41:21,579 --> 02:41:26,700
And then that's what this class does. No, you're supposed to go back to back to back to back and just walk together

1978
02:41:29,020 --> 02:41:31,420
Look at us mining this together doesn't feel good

1979
02:41:32,639 --> 02:41:38,520
It is fun

1980
02:41:38,520 --> 02:41:40,520
Take my hand take my hand

1981
02:41:42,090 --> 02:41:43,920
Okay, let's go

1982
02:41:43,920 --> 02:41:45,920
Make sure you keep your hands our hands locked

1983
02:41:48,200 --> 02:41:49,239
Okay

1984
02:41:49,239 --> 02:41:51,239
What's purple rock?

1985
02:41:53,850 --> 02:41:55,370
Purple rock is

1986
02:41:55,370 --> 02:41:57,370
Help me mine this don't talk to him

1987
02:41:57,530 --> 02:42:00,649
I'm gonna talk to him because he know he wants to know what the what's going on purple rock

1988
02:42:00,649 --> 02:42:03,450
He's not with ronnie would be able to tell me if ronnie were here

1989
02:42:04,010 --> 02:42:06,989
Oh my god, you do not want to talk to ronnie. He's insufferable

1990
02:42:13,069 --> 02:42:14,909
Why are you so rude?

1991
02:42:14,909 --> 02:42:16,190
always

1992
02:42:16,190 --> 02:42:24,510
I like these blue crystals

1993
02:42:24,590 --> 02:42:26,430
They light the place up

1994
02:42:26,430 --> 02:42:29,159
What's this about this cheese? Come get the cheese. Can we do like the moldy cheese?

1995
02:42:30,120 --> 02:42:35,899
Cheese mine, it's nothing. Oh, is it nothing?

1996
02:42:36,379 --> 02:42:38,379
It's dirt dirt

1997
02:42:39,610 --> 02:42:42,250
I have no idea what the purple stuff is. I don't think it's anything

1998
02:42:43,049 --> 02:42:46,889
That actually was just nothing that actually you have ronnie sound board

1999
02:42:48,010 --> 02:42:52,250
That was very accurate. That's exactly the land. We need it. Oh germ over here

2000
02:42:57,639 --> 02:43:01,000
Jeremy i'm coming coming right here. Give me a sec

2001
02:43:03,020 --> 02:43:05,020
I probably wouldn't follow me italics

2002
02:43:08,110 --> 02:43:15,170
Oh, he's actually he's actually in the car. Oh, hey ronnie. Sorry. I thought I thought I was being like manipulated

2003
02:43:16,030 --> 02:43:19,389
You thought I was simulating more people? Well, you are but that's a different thing

2004
02:43:21,450 --> 02:43:23,450
Ah geez are way down there

2005
02:43:26,219 --> 02:43:35,420
I still don't see the greater searching. I got it. I got it bring that thing

2006
02:43:40,440 --> 02:43:43,959
Thanks for taking my clip you just that's what you just did it's the equivalent of what you just did

2007
02:43:45,399 --> 02:43:46,889
No

2008
02:43:46,889 --> 02:43:48,889
Wait here

2009
02:43:49,209 --> 02:43:51,739
Okay

2010
02:43:51,739 --> 02:43:53,739
Okay, we can dig straight down to them

2011
02:43:54,430 --> 02:44:00,329
Okay

2012
02:44:00,329 --> 02:44:02,829

2013
02:44:02,829 --> 02:44:04,829
Here I got you

2014
02:44:09,530 --> 02:44:11,530
So it's gonna make the tunnel down to us

2015
02:44:13,319 --> 02:44:15,319
Okay, so i'm gonna die i'm in a hole

2016
02:44:21,680 --> 02:44:23,680
Hey, germy, you can drop that, you know

2017
02:44:30,889 --> 02:44:32,889
You can drop that and contribute

2018
02:44:42,969 --> 02:44:44,969
Oh, there's another secret thing here

2019
02:44:52,159 --> 02:45:00,329
Good

2020
02:45:00,329 --> 02:45:12,159
You're good. So when should I smash my razor death at it with a hammer?

2021
02:45:14,040 --> 02:45:18,379
Um, should I just put it in like a blender should I put this fucking thing in a blender?

2022
02:45:22,079 --> 02:45:26,620
Yeah, where's ronnie?

2023
02:45:27,020 --> 02:45:29,020
This is my life now. I can't

2024
02:45:30,219 --> 02:45:35,180
Walk he's getting he's digging with a pickaxe and i'm like standing on top of him like shooting up

2025
02:45:36,139 --> 02:45:38,139
I made the tunnel there

2026
02:45:38,299 --> 02:45:41,100
We were already halfway in the ground. We don't know where the tunnel is

2027
02:45:41,500 --> 02:45:43,500
You can see it through the wall

2028
02:45:57,610 --> 02:45:59,610
Now my computer is freaking out i'm gonna die

2029
02:46:04,559 --> 02:46:13,770
I don't give you permission to put that when I screamed I screamed like so hard I farted

2030
02:46:17,530 --> 02:46:19,530
You better uh check

2031
02:46:19,850 --> 02:46:21,530
Hold on wait what?

2032
02:46:21,530 --> 02:46:24,200
Better check for extra

2033
02:46:24,200 --> 02:46:28,200
All right, go ahead and get me up. That's okay. Yeah. No, you're no problem. I'll get you up

2034
02:46:28,760 --> 02:46:30,680
Yeah, I got this now

2035
02:46:30,680 --> 02:46:33,049
I found you

2036
02:46:36,440 --> 02:46:38,440
All right, I think i'm gonna be bigger next time

2037
02:46:40,250 --> 02:46:42,250
Wait, you're you're gonna be bigger

2038
02:46:43,739 --> 02:46:45,120
bigger

2039
02:46:45,120 --> 02:46:47,930
Oh

2040
02:46:47,930 --> 02:46:49,950
But no that probably requires coordination

2041
02:46:53,120 --> 02:46:56,239
So many not really

2042
02:46:56,719 --> 02:46:57,920
Okay

2043
02:46:57,920 --> 02:47:04,670
Here are though

2044
02:47:04,670 --> 02:47:06,670
No, no, no

2045
02:47:28,969 --> 02:47:30,969
I love being out of ammo

2046
02:47:31,209 --> 02:47:33,930
All right, we're going back to back to back to back together next time

2047
02:47:37,129 --> 02:47:41,290
Now we're all gonna put on a shock collar and if you go 20 feet away you get shocked

2048
02:47:41,690 --> 02:48:09,120
Oh, I thought the star I thought this was you just like with your head poking out

2049
02:48:21,100 --> 02:48:22,860
I've got this

2050
02:48:22,860 --> 02:48:31,690
We should use cheat codes. I'm using i'm trying to type them but it's hard to run away from the bugs and type

2051
02:48:32,090 --> 02:49:00,170
Up can someone type black liner liner hear you typing

2052
02:49:05,610 --> 02:49:07,610
Oh shit

2053
02:49:07,690 --> 02:49:10,569
What no, I didn't what I didn't know you were getting me

2054
02:49:12,940 --> 02:49:14,540
fucking god

2055
02:49:14,540 --> 02:49:16,540
Just trying to carry

2056
02:49:17,469 --> 02:49:21,389
I didn't see why you didn't get revived last time. I didn't think you I did

2057
02:49:21,469 --> 02:49:26,989
I'm sitting in mashing on the keyboard. I didn't I thought we were done. Hey, uh, this guy's gonna need two shock collars

2058
02:49:27,950 --> 02:49:30,889
I didn't move. Hey you guys ran away from us

2059
02:49:30,969 --> 02:49:35,209
You went your own way and you went your own tunnels and we went a different direction and that's what happened

2060
02:49:35,930 --> 02:49:38,809
Yeah, we did the hand-holding joke and everything

2061
02:49:39,770 --> 02:49:42,459
No, I'm I like

2062
02:49:43,260 --> 02:49:48,700
Have to revive germo, can you imagine i'm ready i'm ready i'm i can't do it now

2063
02:49:49,420 --> 02:49:53,549
We're in a hole in the wall. You should be able to see this

2064
02:49:54,350 --> 02:49:56,920
Yeah, but I can't reach you unless I like dig through the wall

2065
02:49:57,559 --> 02:50:01,469
Do we look at my keyboard when I type?

2066
02:50:01,629 --> 02:50:09,920
Yeah, I didn't grow up with a computer in my lap. I had to learn it's like learning a new language. I learned I started

2067
02:50:11,850 --> 02:50:13,819
Yeah

2068
02:50:13,819 --> 02:50:19,500
Sorry, I mean I ruined your joke. Sorry. You weren't born with a computer in your lap. Go ahead finish

2069
02:50:23,930 --> 02:50:26,760
Are you paying attention?

2070
02:50:26,760 --> 02:50:28,760
Yes

2071
02:50:29,819 --> 02:50:33,500
I was gonna say you're older than I am, but I didn't even have a computer until I was

2072
02:50:34,219 --> 02:50:36,219
Like yeah 20

2073
02:50:37,790 --> 02:50:41,950
Yeah, they they didn't give me one till I went to college and it was one of those big ones that filled the whole room

2074
02:50:45,950 --> 02:50:47,950
You had to crank the generator for it

2075
02:50:50,280 --> 02:50:55,129
Or one of us in here is uh spoiled. Oh, that was perfect

2076
02:51:05,280 --> 02:51:18,290
I never had a cranking generator. All right, are we good? No, why is there another one of these they just keep coming out of nowhere

2077
02:51:25,870 --> 02:51:29,629
You guys really were digging down like parallel to the hole that I made for you

2078
02:51:30,350 --> 02:51:34,989
We were already most of the way down when you made your hole and then I couldn't get to your hole

2079
02:51:36,270 --> 02:51:42,430
You could have and you don't you just don't understand how this game is supposed to be played. I understand. I just don't believe you

2080
02:51:42,750 --> 02:51:45,120
You're a noob

2081
02:51:45,120 --> 02:51:47,840
Did you not resurrect the other guy like you were the one in the hole?

2082
02:51:51,600 --> 02:51:53,600
You didn't get other guy

2083
02:51:54,399 --> 02:51:56,399
Oh, you didn't get other guy

2084
02:51:57,280 --> 02:52:07,959
Hey, he didn't get other guy. Okay, there's one resupply here, but it's like in the wall

2085
02:52:13,479 --> 02:52:16,440
Another swarm so resupply and um be ready

2086
02:52:18,280 --> 02:52:23,399
Uh, i'm good on supplies because you haven't played in an hour. Yeah pretty much

2087
02:52:24,840 --> 02:52:27,020
Is that a record scratch?

2088
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:38,600
Why did this turn into like a fucking am talk show

2089
02:52:40,440 --> 02:52:42,440
Another record scratch. That's my screen

2090
02:52:57,129 --> 02:52:59,229
Oh, I think I just fucking destroyed ronnie

2091
02:53:03,129 --> 02:53:06,860
I think it's a right of passage at this point. I did that earlier

2092
02:53:15,770 --> 02:53:18,430
Get off me

2093
02:53:18,430 --> 02:53:20,430
There's too many. There's too many

2094
02:53:23,440 --> 02:53:25,440
So the hitbox wasn't the problem

2095
02:53:33,229 --> 02:53:35,309
Thank god, all right, we don't have any

2096
02:53:37,129 --> 02:53:39,129
Uh, do we have enough for supplies?

2097
02:53:39,530 --> 02:53:42,030
No, we don't

2098
02:53:42,430 --> 02:53:44,110
What the hell are we gonna do?

2099
02:53:44,110 --> 02:53:46,590
We have to keep going forward and get resupply

2100
02:53:50,190 --> 02:53:52,190
Like let's start fighting forward down this hill

2101
02:53:55,180 --> 02:53:57,020
Push through, you know

2102
02:53:57,020 --> 02:53:59,020
three three

2103
02:54:02,909 --> 02:54:04,909
This is one of these things

2104
02:54:06,440 --> 02:54:10,920
Uh down here. Oh, why did you hold control? Hold, uh control you can see where we are

2105
02:54:10,920 --> 02:54:14,680
Oh god, I found like a mother sack or something hard to hold control when i'm dead

2106
02:54:17,479 --> 02:54:20,200
Are you dead? Oh, yeah, then why does it matter where we went?

2107
02:54:22,559 --> 02:54:26,079
Are we killing the sack

2108
02:54:31,850 --> 02:54:36,680
Bad not good. There's a lot of ore over here

2109
02:54:45,079 --> 02:54:47,319
Hey germa, you have drill I do have

2110
02:54:48,680 --> 02:54:50,840
I'm underneath you get up here

2111
02:54:52,680 --> 02:54:54,840
I'm making the call you're making the call

2112
02:54:55,719 --> 02:54:59,770
All right, what do you got? What do you need control dig towards his dead body?

2113
02:55:01,069 --> 02:55:03,069
You're i'm digging. Yeah that way

2114
02:55:03,309 --> 02:55:13,020
Hold on out of uh, how did yours?

2115
02:55:13,979 --> 02:55:20,719
Like the last millisecond I realized what that was on the ground. I was like, oh, what is that man?

2116
02:55:21,360 --> 02:55:23,360
That was almost my clip

2117
02:55:23,440 --> 02:55:25,639
almost

2118
02:55:25,639 --> 02:55:27,639
Almost your clip

2119
02:55:32,909 --> 02:55:35,549
There's a lot of this we've gotten 20 more pipes

2120
02:55:36,510 --> 02:55:38,510
Yeah, it's pretty bad, isn't it?

2121
02:55:40,079 --> 02:55:45,040
I thought we were just here shooting bugs for fun. To be honest, there's also the uh, those those those

2122
02:55:45,819 --> 02:55:47,819
crystal, um

2123
02:55:47,840 --> 02:55:49,840
It's a lag crystal light drinks

2124
02:55:50,360 --> 02:55:52,680
Crystal light is as literal poison. Don't drink it

2125
02:55:53,559 --> 02:55:59,719
That's all ashley, but she doesn't drink it. She eats the dust. She doesn't mix it with water. She just eats the dust

2126
02:56:00,200 --> 02:56:02,200
Please be kidding

2127
02:56:02,280 --> 02:56:05,799
No, ronnie how many times you heard me say ashley eats dust

2128
02:56:06,760 --> 02:56:10,760
Uh, I just always assumed the dust came with liquid wait

2129
02:56:11,479 --> 02:56:13,479
She she eats crystal light dust

2130
02:56:13,959 --> 02:56:16,040
Yeah, are these like drug code words?

2131
02:56:20,590 --> 02:56:25,790
Like I heard a peanut butter dust, but I assume she mixed it. She also eats the peanut butter too dust

2132
02:56:25,870 --> 02:56:29,469
That's that's like an apocalypse peanut butter. Okay, she does mix that. All right

2133
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:33,959
But does that crystal light's not okay crystal light?

2134
02:56:34,840 --> 02:56:36,920
Uh, is that what they're calling it nowadays? Okay

2135
02:56:39,020 --> 02:56:40,379
Where we going?

2136
02:56:40,379 --> 02:56:42,750
I don't know need we've 65 out of 200

2137
02:56:44,489 --> 02:56:45,450
um

2138
02:56:45,450 --> 02:56:46,489
we need

2139
02:56:46,489 --> 02:56:50,329
Honestly, we meet we need more nitro. Oh, I'm my we're out of ammo like again

2140
02:56:54,090 --> 02:56:57,129
Basically what you're looking for at this point when you don't know where to go is one of those dirt walls

2141
02:56:57,770 --> 02:56:59,690
Would be the next area

2142
02:56:59,690 --> 02:57:06,200
It's probably not a good idea. I think i'm going backwards

2143
02:57:09,420 --> 02:57:11,260
Yeah, we shouldn't go this way

2144
02:57:11,260 --> 02:57:13,819
Not this way

2145
02:57:13,819 --> 02:57:15,819
I'm not talking to you. I'm gonna stick some

2146
02:57:16,540 --> 02:57:19,500
Oh, you're coming this way too. Yeah, not this way. I know everyone was following me

2147
02:57:20,540 --> 02:57:22,909
And you're king

2148
02:57:22,909 --> 02:57:24,829
I'm the king

2149
02:57:24,829 --> 02:57:29,469
Well, if she likes crystal light dust, why doesn't she just get like a pixie stick? It's kind of that same thing

2150
02:57:31,120 --> 02:57:36,079
I think one of them is free of calories. Thank you. Yeah zero calories

2151
02:57:36,879 --> 02:57:38,559
It would have to be

2152
02:57:38,559 --> 02:57:40,559
Oh, there's a thing in there

2153
02:57:40,639 --> 02:57:42,559
Is this nitro or

2154
02:57:42,559 --> 02:57:46,159
Oh, I found a bunch of nitro pixie sticks are for when you want to get serious, you know

2155
02:57:46,719 --> 02:57:48,719
Crystal light light is in the name

2156
02:57:49,600 --> 02:57:51,600
Crystal light dust is a

2157
02:57:52,959 --> 02:57:54,959
It's a gateway drug to pixie

2158
02:57:55,920 --> 02:57:59,680
Her parents are visiting this weekend and we went out to a river and we were swimming in the river

2159
02:58:00,719 --> 02:58:03,180
and she

2160
02:58:03,180 --> 02:58:05,180
Won't admit it was a river

2161
02:58:05,870 --> 02:58:07,549
And i'm worried about her

2162
02:58:07,549 --> 02:58:09,549
She keeps saying it was a lake

2163
02:58:09,549 --> 02:58:12,430
Was the water moving in one direction? Yeah

2164
02:58:13,149 --> 02:58:15,149
It's a river. Oh, it's here

2165
02:58:15,149 --> 02:58:16,030
I got the thing

2166
02:58:16,110 --> 02:58:20,989
I think she was calling it a lake because she could you can't see either end of the river because it was like a bend

2167
02:58:20,989 --> 02:58:22,989
So it looked like a lake

2168
02:58:23,149 --> 02:58:25,309
But she like won't admit that it was a river

2169
02:58:26,920 --> 02:58:29,879
But it's a hundred and six mile long river

2170
02:58:31,479 --> 02:58:34,750
What's it doing over here

2171
02:58:34,829 --> 02:58:39,389
Well rivers that are exactly the mule up here to be honest. That's just insulting to cartographers. Okay

2172
02:58:40,110 --> 02:58:41,870
it's more well see

2173
02:58:41,950 --> 02:58:48,670
Little known fact rivers that are exactly 106 miles long are actually classified as lake really

2174
02:58:49,229 --> 02:58:51,600
Yeah

2175
02:58:51,680 --> 02:58:53,680
This is a very long lake

2176
02:58:58,090 --> 02:59:00,090
That and she's eating the dust

2177
02:59:00,809 --> 02:59:05,290
She's eating the lake dust. She won't let me like hear her either. She's eating the lake dust to her

2178
02:59:05,370 --> 02:59:07,370
She's like go away. I'm gassy

2179
02:59:11,360 --> 02:59:13,360
I deposited the uh the jade thing

2180
02:59:13,680 --> 02:59:21,450
Something again, uh, okay, I guess you're just gonna talk about the game. I have like a real narrow problem

2181
02:59:22,569 --> 02:59:24,489
malachite

2182
02:59:24,489 --> 02:59:30,090
Listen, I opened up to you guys some people need to understand which is not an excuse for your mental health. Okay

2183
02:59:31,049 --> 02:59:33,049
You handle that with a professional

2184
02:59:35,850 --> 02:59:37,850
We've got bugs surrounding

2185
02:59:39,959 --> 02:59:43,280
Where's that dang wheel?

2186
02:59:43,280 --> 02:59:45,840
I need it. I'm finding all the stuff you people need

2187
02:59:46,879 --> 02:59:52,760

2188
02:59:54,780 --> 02:59:57,020
No, no, no, don't fall down all the way. I'm good

2189
03:00:01,520 --> 03:00:04,860
I'm trying to knock it killed. Where's this mule?

2190
03:00:07,770 --> 03:00:10,430
You called it

2191
03:00:10,430 --> 03:00:19,959
Okay, we gotta go up top here. Is there no more supply? We're close. We gotta keep pushing

2192
03:00:24,120 --> 03:00:25,399
That's not good

2193
03:00:25,399 --> 03:00:31,610
Where's that loot bunk?

2194
03:00:32,649 --> 03:00:38,799
What's so funny what

2195
03:00:39,639 --> 03:00:41,799
Are you dead? Who's dead?

2196
03:00:42,680 --> 03:00:46,170
Hey, that was that was definitely going on that stream

2197
03:00:49,850 --> 03:00:52,649
Guys I don't want to alarm you but

2198
03:00:53,610 --> 03:01:00,670
Not by everyone literally everyone we need to go to the top

2199
03:01:02,250 --> 03:01:08,969
Well, i'm trying to people are dying. I'm trying to wrangle children. I'm i'm people are dying down here

2200
03:01:09,770 --> 03:01:12,969
We're dying down here. You set up up in your tower and fucking look down

2201
03:01:15,819 --> 03:01:17,899
We're trying to make things happen down here trying to survive

2202
03:01:28,059 --> 03:01:30,299
Are you posting the picture of me hugging the waterfall?

2203
03:01:33,440 --> 03:01:37,770
dead

2204
03:01:37,770 --> 03:01:39,770
All right, we've broken through

2205
03:01:40,090 --> 03:01:43,229
But I think that we ended up

2206
03:01:43,229 --> 03:01:46,909
The hell did we end up?

2207
03:01:46,909 --> 03:01:50,190
I think we already think we've wrapped around in a circle. I think

2208
03:01:50,750 --> 03:01:52,750
Uh shit

2209
03:01:53,149 --> 03:01:55,149
You were so adamant of us coming up here

I swear to god, I can't believe that that hurt me that much

2213
03:02:15,799 --> 03:02:18,120
Where were we off to up here? I don't know

2214
03:02:18,840 --> 03:02:21,600
Look at the map the map we

2215
03:02:24,219 --> 03:02:26,219
We could go down

2216
03:02:26,379 --> 03:02:29,739
Down to the left lower left. We kind of have to like go all the way down left

2217
03:02:30,459 --> 03:02:33,180
If you open up the map sweet, we gotta go this way then

2218
03:02:35,450 --> 03:02:36,809
Follow me

2219
03:02:36,809 --> 03:02:38,409

03:03:26,989 --> 03:03:28,989
We haven't been down here

2230

We need that Michael like there's a lot of stuff here a lot of stuff here guys looking good you guys

2236
03:04:18,969 --> 03:04:22,329
Hey, remember how we skipped the last like 45 minutes of us looking around in the youtube video

2237
03:04:22,329 --> 03:04:25,129
So we can get to this part. This is it guys. Yeah, we just cut

2238
03:04:26,090 --> 03:04:36,940
No, we just leave it all unedited but cut into 10 minute slices and say it's just the episode

2239
03:04:36,940 --> 03:04:38,940
We finally find the more guys

2240
03:04:39,260 --> 03:04:41,899
That's the title. Sorry guys tune in next time

2241
03:04:42,860 --> 03:04:47,180
Oh, no more kite this time guys click here to subscribe aliens

2242
03:04:47,979 --> 03:04:49,979
If you keep saying this i'm not going to be able to do it

2243
03:04:56,920 --> 03:05:12,799
Where's molly how much more we do 50 how many do you guys have hey and nobody's fucking helping me

2244
03:05:15,610 --> 03:05:21,690
What like it like an entitled thing to say i'm calling resupply do not touch the red button

2245
03:05:25,719 --> 03:05:28,909
Germa don't what do you not want me to do?

2246
03:05:34,479 --> 03:05:35,840
Here's the question

2247
03:05:35,840 --> 03:05:38,639
If they can just drop resupply pods from wherever they want

2248
03:05:39,200 --> 03:05:43,200
Why don't they just arm us with the drill that the resupply pod uses?

2249
03:05:45,440 --> 03:05:49,020
Shut up, uh because

2250
03:05:50,350 --> 03:05:52,350
Never mind. I was gonna say like a tv show thing

2251
03:05:54,329 --> 03:05:58,329
I mean, this is pretty much like the faster than light star wars issue all over again

2252
03:05:59,129 --> 03:06:01,370
Okay, so we need a second to plan when you look at the map

2253
03:06:02,170 --> 03:06:04,170
And try and figure out where we came back from

2254
03:06:04,969 --> 03:06:08,809
You press the button the thing walks back. You can either follow the mule or we can just start drilling

2255
03:06:09,370 --> 03:06:12,889
Well up if you want I we can start drilling up if you want

2256
03:06:13,450 --> 03:06:15,930
We got to be ready for that though. Where from where you want to go?

2257
03:06:16,889 --> 03:06:19,120
It looks like you can also okay. Come on

2258
03:06:19,120 --> 03:06:22,959
We can just start walking this way and then call the mule to us. We could just we okay. Hold on

2259
03:06:23,600 --> 03:06:24,799
Come over here

2260
03:06:24,799 --> 03:06:26,969
If we go over here

2261
03:06:27,290 --> 03:06:31,520
If we go through this tunnel and then up

2262
03:06:33,450 --> 03:06:35,790
Yeah, like this way

2263
03:06:35,790 --> 03:06:37,790
Climb back up this climb back up that

2264
03:06:38,430 --> 03:06:43,040
Because we have to get back up to the top, right?

2265
03:06:43,680 --> 03:06:47,850
Yeah

2266
03:06:47,850 --> 03:06:50,569
Watch out it's bug city. Oh fuck it is bug city

2267
03:06:53,979 --> 03:07:06,719
Okay, so then from here

2268
03:07:08,639 --> 03:07:10,639
We should be able to go up this way

2269
03:07:12,190 --> 03:07:15,549
Just like straight up this way over here

2270
03:07:16,700 --> 03:07:18,729
right

2271
03:07:18,729 --> 03:07:20,250
because then

2272
03:07:20,250 --> 03:07:22,250
That'll take us like, uh

2273
03:07:24,110 --> 03:07:26,110
All right. Let's go. All right

2274
03:07:28,909 --> 03:07:32,430
Let's clear this and then we'll go clear that don't go yet

2275
03:07:33,229 --> 03:07:35,229
Yeah, just set up defense here

2276
03:07:38,590 --> 03:07:40,590
Otherwise, we're gonna get a swarm goal. We're trying to figure out

2277
03:07:58,750 --> 03:08:01,559
Watch the behind watch the behind

2278
03:08:09,879 --> 03:08:27,819
Oh my god, come on, we ready to move this is a big dude over here

2280
03:09:15,930 --> 03:09:21,799
All right, are we ready? Yeah, so now we gotta go we gotta go like up this way then

2281
03:09:23,479 --> 03:09:27,719
Also the mule walks back to it so we can just follow the mule and we're just following just follow the mule

2282
03:09:28,360 --> 03:09:30,299
Yeah

2283
03:09:30,299 --> 03:09:32,299
Okay

2284
03:09:34,190 --> 03:09:38,430
I'm just gonna stand on top of it easy mode and now yeah now it shows you where the drop pod is coming to

2285
03:09:44,409 --> 03:09:48,010
Drop on arrived mule is returning to lz. Yeah, we can just we can dig through

03:10:38,760 --> 03:10:40,440
I have no guns

2296
03:10:40,440 --> 03:10:43,760
Where the hell did it go over there?

2297
03:10:43,840 --> 03:10:48,620
Oh shit

2298
03:10:48,620 --> 03:10:51,340
I'm never gonna dig 85 meters in four minutes

2299
03:10:52,059 --> 03:10:55,229
We get good

2300
03:10:55,229 --> 03:10:57,229
Hey, oh me the talics are up here

2301
03:10:57,629 --> 03:10:59,469
Are you guys good?

2302
03:10:59,469 --> 03:11:01,870
Oh different hole. Oh talics. What do we do?

2303
03:11:02,430 --> 03:11:06,430
Just uh, let the bugs let the bugs go eat them and we'll escape you gotta run

2304
03:11:08,120 --> 03:11:10,120
I'll i'll get up there eventually

2305
03:11:10,440 --> 03:11:12,440
Just look towards the drop pod and dig

2306
03:11:14,440 --> 03:11:20,590
Why'd you say you were there you're like

2307
03:11:22,059 --> 03:11:24,620
Hey, are we all right?

2308
03:11:26,379 --> 03:11:31,610
Turn around. Oh god. Are we okay?

2309
03:11:33,149 --> 03:11:35,870
Are we all right? Keep digging. I I have no fuel

2310
03:11:39,200 --> 03:11:41,200
I can't leave him behind

2311
03:11:42,079 --> 03:11:47,000
We're almost there

2312
03:11:47,159 --> 03:11:49,159
Where the fuck are we?

2313
03:11:52,239 --> 03:11:54,239
You said you were there

2314
03:11:56,270 --> 03:11:58,270
One for you and one for me

2315
03:11:58,750 --> 03:12:01,629
I actually ran the whole path

2316
03:12:03,149 --> 03:12:05,229
Oh, no, don't die

2317
03:12:05,229 --> 03:12:08,010
All right. I'm gonna go

2318
03:12:08,010 --> 03:12:11,049
No, which way is the right way which way it's the correct way

2319
03:12:12,010 --> 03:12:13,610
i'm down

2320
03:12:13,610 --> 03:12:19,129
Wait, where am I going?

2321
03:12:19,129 --> 03:12:22,270
No

2322
03:12:24,590 --> 03:12:26,909
See you at home

2323
03:12:26,909 --> 03:12:29,389
We all right to be fair. We did you get did you make it?

2324
03:12:30,270 --> 03:12:32,270
Yeah, he made it. Yes

2325
03:12:32,590 --> 03:12:34,590
We pulled everybody into that tunnel

2326
03:12:43,739 --> 03:12:47,500
Nice job everyone. I hope jerma stretched his shoulder before he threw that hard

2327
03:12:47,579 --> 03:12:53,180
I don't have nobody had any ammo. We didn't know we were i'm trying to like just dig we're fine. We the missions went we won

2328
03:12:55,000 --> 03:12:57,000
Yeah, we wanted i'm still alive

2329
03:13:01,319 --> 03:13:05,639
When you don't stick to the plan, this is what happens. Let's get back to work

2330
03:13:08,059 --> 03:13:10,379
You're still alive. Why are we resurrecting in the med bay?

2331
03:13:11,440 --> 03:13:13,440
Well because we were checking on you guys

2332
03:13:17,340 --> 03:13:18,780
That was so fucking bad though

2333
03:13:18,860 --> 03:13:23,260
Like I I had the depth wrong and I turned the camera and we're just like tunneling

2334
03:13:23,899 --> 03:13:26,059
Like a tube sock on the left side of the map

2335
03:13:26,700 --> 03:13:31,020
But we did pull everybody away from star and then we may have not have made it out alive without that

2336
03:13:34,879 --> 03:13:36,319
Yeah, I just bailed

2337
03:13:36,319 --> 03:13:44,430
And how do I get a second freaking turret? I don't see the upgrade for it

2338
03:13:46,090 --> 03:13:49,049
You should just always have two turrets. I had it at level one

2339
03:13:50,250 --> 03:13:54,170
I did back in the beta and I cannot figure out how to get my it's the same button

2340
03:13:54,729 --> 03:13:58,090
So like you press four to place the turret then you press four to place the next one

2341
03:13:58,569 --> 03:14:04,059
And when I do that, it just recalls the previous one. I don't think it should

2342
03:14:11,819 --> 03:14:14,590
what do you think faster shield regen rate

2343
03:14:15,760 --> 03:14:17,260
or

2344
03:14:17,260 --> 03:14:25,309
Regen starts sooner for shield. I'm gonna check out youtube videos who they say you're the what you're making it

2345
03:14:25,389 --> 03:14:27,149
You're making that video now

2346
03:14:27,149 --> 03:14:31,530
So yeah, he's trying to get some insider tips everyone saying sooner

2347
03:14:32,409 --> 03:14:37,450
I would get better guns before you can get armor stuff unless you just can't afford the other things

2348
03:14:37,690 --> 03:14:39,770
I mean, I have one upgrade already into my

2349
03:14:40,649 --> 03:14:41,930
I need

2350
03:14:41,930 --> 03:14:45,370
I need this like silver or it's like a silver circle

2351
03:14:47,959 --> 03:14:52,159
I don't have any of it. I don't know what it is

2352
03:14:52,799 --> 03:14:56,409
There's an upgrade that makes you have one better turret into the two weak jump

2353
03:14:56,969 --> 03:14:57,770
Oh

2354
03:14:57,770 --> 03:15:04,569
No, i've even oh I can switch which modifications i'm using. Aha. Yeah. Well, that's a game changer

2355
03:15:05,370 --> 03:15:06,489
Aha

2356
03:15:06,489 --> 03:15:12,520
Give me that better drill

2357
03:15:12,520 --> 03:15:18,159
All right, let me put some perks in

2358
03:15:18,159 --> 03:15:23,040
Accessories, oh shit. What is this stuff a clean shave? Oh, what was that company?

2359
03:15:24,079 --> 03:15:26,079
Dollar shave club. Wow

2360
03:15:27,520 --> 03:15:30,719
Doesn't even remember the name of it from the same stream we're getting another plug

2361
03:15:33,020 --> 03:15:36,059
By the way, I did this this is for uh, comedy purposes only

2362
03:15:36,059 --> 03:15:39,819
This is with no affiliation at all. We have to say that otherwise you could get in trouble before you just did

2363
03:15:41,739 --> 03:15:43,739
Fuck a shave club

2364
03:15:44,940 --> 03:15:50,139
I did this this this is an opinion of somebody here. This is I don't know. I did I I don't even know who this is

2365
03:15:51,360 --> 03:15:55,600
I've never met them before in my life. I don't know who they are. So glad is the best a man can get

2366
03:15:58,559 --> 03:16:01,600
I don't I don't I cannot confirm or deny any of the statements

2367
03:16:02,489 --> 03:16:04,489
What if i'm not a man?

2368
03:16:08,840 --> 03:16:12,159
Oh, these are just hats

2369
03:16:12,159 --> 03:16:13,120
Yeah

2370
03:16:13,120 --> 03:16:21,229
Well, that's cool

2371
03:16:21,229 --> 03:16:27,469
This upgrade screen is not rad and sexy as fuck making my tummy twerk. What the fuck are you talking about?

2372
03:16:30,920 --> 03:16:32,920
Are we ready

2373
03:16:33,239 --> 03:16:39,239
I am now ready. Wait, wait, wait, where's the perk? Um, where's the perk screen? No inside your

2374
03:16:40,200 --> 03:16:42,680
Room, I think there's something wrong with my gun

2375
03:16:43,559 --> 03:16:49,520
What's wrong?

2376
03:16:49,520 --> 03:16:52,799
It's just not being used to being handled by such a handsome man

2377
03:16:53,520 --> 03:17:00,590
I don't have any available perks. Yeah, I do

2378
03:17:06,639 --> 03:17:11,120
All right, what are these what are these? Hey, hey i'm on stirr's floor

2379
03:17:12,079 --> 03:17:17,100
Interesting

2380
03:17:17,100 --> 03:17:22,219
Look chat. I don't know what you're thinking right now, but this is all real. It's happening. It's live

2381
03:17:22,940 --> 03:17:33,819
Whoa, what's going on?

2382
03:17:33,899 --> 03:17:36,079
We're about to leave. Okay

2383
03:17:36,639 --> 03:17:39,200
Oh, I need the ore that's here

2384
03:17:40,479 --> 03:17:42,799

2385
03:17:43,760 --> 03:17:47,049
What time is it right now?

2386
03:17:47,049 --> 03:17:49,930
Can I BRB real quick? Oh my god

03:17:58,219 --> 03:17:59,899
Hey guys, what's up?

2390
03:17:59,899 --> 03:18:01,899
Hi. Hey guys, what's up?

2391
03:18:01,979 --> 03:18:05,129
I'm unplugging the router. I'm just gonna unplug the router must

2392
03:18:05,770 --> 03:18:11,530
Must be my internet taking so long to load. I can't imagine my computer slowing us down unless you all just have way better

2393
03:18:15,450 --> 03:18:18,010
No

2394
03:18:18,010 --> 03:18:22,170
My computer's not slow. It could do 144 and overwatch just fine. No

2395
03:18:23,799 --> 03:18:27,719
By the way, it was great. I think I think I just heard like a door close behind me

2396
03:18:28,920 --> 03:18:32,600
I'm fairly certain. He like actually went to the bathroom and like put like a clip on

2397
03:18:33,719 --> 03:18:37,280
That's fine a clip on like a tie

2398
03:18:38,559 --> 03:18:40,559
He's got an interview later

2399
03:18:47,500 --> 03:18:50,540
It like started us right next to this objective, I mean, that's pretty great

2400
03:18:54,799 --> 03:18:59,659
We need these rooms

2401
03:19:00,940 --> 03:19:06,809
Uh, we've got I want to say that it explodes pretty long actually

2402
03:19:11,899 --> 03:19:19,229

Is there another one around you it's right here

2406
03:19:52,569 --> 03:19:57,260
Doesn't look like it

2407
03:19:57,340 --> 03:19:59,340
I think that's the bonus leg

2408
03:19:59,420 --> 03:20:04,040
You know how cars have like a extra tire on the back

2409
03:20:04,920 --> 03:20:06,670

2592
03:36:12,010 --> 03:36:14,010
The gold bar

2593
03:36:14,809 --> 03:36:19,930
Where's the gold bar important, where's the gold bar? I dropped the gold bar

2594
03:36:20,010 --> 03:36:33,899
Where's the gold bar it fell because I got grabbed are we gonna lose this guys?

2595
03:36:34,950 --> 03:36:38,860
Yeah

2596
03:36:44,180 --> 03:36:48,100
Leave it to a couple tf2 players to not know how to play the objective in my right

2597
03:36:48,180 --> 03:36:54,420
I got the gold thing. I was it was directed by our director here star to go get gold thing

2598
03:36:55,780 --> 03:36:57,780
What is this too far?

2599
03:37:00,340 --> 03:37:03,139
I was I went I got I got it and it didn't take me very long

2600
03:37:04,100 --> 03:37:06,899
Let me be fair to myself here. I was on top of that real quick

2601
03:37:07,860 --> 03:37:10,360
I got a whole stream over here. That'll back me up

2602
03:37:20,389 --> 03:37:24,920
I can't believe we just lost

2603
03:37:27,479 --> 03:37:40,469
I need a soft and supple touch. I need someone to call daddy. Hi

2604
03:37:46,940 --> 03:37:59,940
Jesus

2605
03:37:59,940 --> 03:38:02,739
When you don't stick to the plan, this is what happens

2606
03:38:04,579 --> 03:38:06,579
That ended as well

2607
03:38:13,139 --> 03:38:21,270
This is me i'm throwing a tantrum right now

2608
03:38:29,930 --> 03:38:31,930
Do you think guys think the

03:38:32,809 --> 03:38:36,010
One turret well, okay, they got stats. Never mind. I can figure it out

2610
03:38:36,329 --> 03:38:39,739
I'm just resigned to the fact that i'll never be able to upgrade anything

2611
03:38:41,270 --> 03:38:45,270
Can we beat that one level that one time? All right, but how about we drop the difficulty by one?

2612
03:38:46,069 --> 03:38:48,389
Is it really that embarrassing to play on like not the hard one

2613
03:38:50,069 --> 03:38:52,379
That wasn't even the hard one

2614
03:38:54,659 --> 03:38:56,659
But sure, yeah, we can do baby mode

2615
03:38:59,639 --> 03:39:05,899
What is but okay is baby mode in regular mode no, it's not baby mode

2616
03:39:07,899 --> 03:39:09,420
Dude, I don't know

Stop yelling

2620
03:39:15,700 --> 03:39:19,379
I'm very calm and i'm very collected. I'm just asking a few questions about this video

03:39:20,899 --> 03:39:27,209
Times oh you guys are leaving. I was still what does real mean?

See for context guys, you actually can't play with germa unless you're subscribed to him. That's why I still have myself

03:48:21,049 --> 03:48:23,049
Is there a way to find the broken? Uh

2725
03:48:23,770 --> 03:48:28,010

I'm grappled to the air good

2733
03:48:57,379 --> 03:49:01,670

This is probably gonna have to be my last game because I have to take auto to the vet

2736
03:49:09,299 --> 03:49:12,250
What a likely story

2737
03:49:12,250 --> 03:49:14,969
Like my mom shows up and suddenly you have you have to like leave

2738
03:49:15,530 --> 03:49:17,690
Oh and like oh she's leaving at the same time, too

03:49:18,649 --> 03:49:20,649
Oh, nothing's going on here

2740
03:49:20,969 --> 03:49:23,370
What the fuck are you saying right now?

2741
03:49:27,719 --> 03:49:30,950

2743
03:49:38,549 --> 03:49:40,549
Just that sounds like a story

2744
03:49:40,870 --> 03:49:42,870
Oh god, i'm gonna die. Oh

2745
03:49:45,110 --> 03:49:47,510

03:50:06,180 --> 03:50:07,299
torching

2750
03:50:07,299 --> 03:50:08,340
running

2751
03:50:08,420 --> 03:50:10,420
Leading out

2752
03:50:13,620 --> 03:50:15,620
This is the worst what's the worst

2753
03:50:17,540 --> 03:50:21,700
Robot over here is in the worst spot. It's so annoying to do this alone and no one's helping me

2754
03:50:21,700 --> 03:50:24,659
There's like a grapple guy that could be helping them. I'm all alone

2755
03:50:25,219 --> 03:50:28,979
And my mom's in the chat like yeah, my favorite stream of yours is when jerma played stardew valley

2756
03:50:30,100 --> 03:50:32,739
Well, you definitely would be more the clips if you were like over here

2757
03:50:35,510 --> 03:50:37,829
Then she might see you more when she watches his videos

2758
03:50:37,909 --> 03:50:39,110
What

2759
03:50:39,110 --> 03:50:43,030
It's a stream. I did like fucking four years ago and

2760
03:50:43,829 --> 03:50:45,030
what

2761
03:50:45,030 --> 03:50:49,829
But it is but you're not but you're not in valley after that, but you're not in that is that

2762
03:50:53,079 --> 03:50:59,479
Wait, i'm hold on

2763
03:51:02,520 --> 03:51:06,760
Words just like flipped out of my mouth. It was like I had nothing to say about it

2764
03:51:07,479 --> 03:51:09,479
That's why that's the point

2765
03:51:10,520 --> 03:51:12,440
She's a real fan

2766
03:51:12,440 --> 03:51:15,770
All right. We got that done

2767
03:51:15,770 --> 03:51:18,649
Yeah, she came here to visit was like hey check out my glue man shirt

2768
03:51:19,450 --> 03:51:23,500

2769
03:51:23,500 --> 03:51:25,020
It's below us

2770
03:51:25,020 --> 03:51:26,059

By the way, uh, those are still available. Look at me. They are here

2773
03:51:33,379 --> 03:51:34,579

2775
03:51:36,059 --> 03:51:38,059
That's it. Okay

2776
03:51:38,389 --> 03:51:42,790
What like she's already bought one. Okay, you don't need to advertise it again, please stop

It feels like an hour it has been an hour I think

2780
03:52:08,069 --> 03:52:13,100
At least oh, but it's closer now

2781
03:52:13,899 --> 03:52:18,459
Hey, you guys are all doing great. We just had to draw this particular round out long enough mountain

2782
03:52:20,540 --> 03:52:22,540
Until jerma has to go

2783
03:52:23,500 --> 03:52:26,940
So we're like doing exactly right we're doing it yeah, we're doing it right

2784
03:52:27,420 --> 03:52:30,379
All right. Give me a chance to redeem myself. Okay, here it is

2785
03:52:31,340 --> 03:52:38,739
You guys are what are you guys even up to over here?

2786
03:52:39,299 --> 03:52:40,340
I feel like

2787
03:52:40,340 --> 03:52:43,219
Me and italics are missing. I don't know what's happening. Well, i'm gonna be honest

I've been following you guys around for about two and a half three hours. I have no idea

Well, i've marked it like six times you marked it. How do you do that?

2796
03:53:23,780 --> 03:53:26,100

03:53:27,700 --> 03:53:29,139

2798
03:53:29,139 --> 03:53:32,569
Oh is this room? We only need one more shroom and this is it right here

2799
03:53:42,780 --> 03:53:47,340

2800
03:53:48,219 --> 03:53:54,620
All right marked on the map

2801
03:53:58,729 --> 03:54:02,040
Ronnie, no, no look

2802
03:54:02,040 --> 03:54:05,479
It's in that little cave. Why is it all the way up there when I throw it to the bottom?

2803
03:54:05,879 --> 03:54:07,079
I don't know dude

2804
03:54:07,079 --> 03:54:09,079
Where did I where did it go? Oh, it's there

2805
03:54:10,870 --> 03:54:14,389
I don't know why would I why would I throw it down there if it was all the way up here

2806
03:54:14,870 --> 03:54:16,860
To explain that

2807
03:54:16,860 --> 03:54:17,979
I don't know

2808
03:54:17,979 --> 03:54:22,809
Come on. Come on. Come on. I just now realized I have a shield mic

2809
03:54:24,420 --> 03:54:26,420
That was pretty cool. I do hear the beep now

2810
03:54:28,940 --> 03:54:31,940
I hear it

2811
03:54:31,940 --> 03:54:33,940
big brained baby

2812
03:54:35,620 --> 03:54:40,420
Oh

2813
03:54:40,420 --> 03:54:46,920
An eternity later. All right. I got the one I got one cap

2814
03:54:47,639 --> 03:54:49,639
So we can do this this time

2815
03:54:50,280 --> 03:54:52,280
Let's focus and get this done

2816
03:54:52,840 --> 03:54:54,840
Legally speaking I did help

2817
03:54:57,559 --> 03:54:59,879
Yeah, germa has to go like kiss his dog or whatever

2818
03:55:02,629 --> 03:55:04,629
Well, not right this second

2819
03:55:09,450 --> 03:55:17,299
All right, are we doing this am I pressing the button yeah here we go

2820
03:55:19,239 --> 03:55:22,149
Over here

2821
03:55:22,149 --> 03:55:30,700
The mules are fine. I don't know why it always takes germa like six tries on the side of the draw six tries to do what?

2822
03:55:31,500 --> 03:55:35,399
What do I have what takes me six tries?

2823
03:55:36,040 --> 03:55:38,200
Forget it. Just you just forget it. You know what?

2824
03:55:49,959 --> 03:55:51,799
Germa, yeah

2825
03:55:51,799 --> 03:55:56,729
If we're supposed to just both be subscribed to each other for like friendship points

2826
03:55:57,610 --> 03:55:59,850
Aren't we just giving twitch money?

2827
03:56:00,010 --> 03:56:02,569
And then jeff bezos is that much closer to ruling the world?

2828
03:56:03,450 --> 03:56:05,610
Yeah

2829
03:56:05,690 --> 03:56:08,090
I I how about this just just unsubscribe however

2830
03:56:09,129 --> 03:56:13,610
Did you know that if you subscribe to another streamer, it could be attacked right off

2831
03:56:14,809 --> 03:56:19,209
Yeah, but what if we just both unsub from each other and I just like at a convention

2832
03:56:19,209 --> 03:56:21,530
Just give you a 50 dollar bill. You give me a 50 dollar bill

2833
03:56:22,090 --> 03:56:23,610
No, listen

2834
03:56:23,610 --> 03:56:25,129
You unsub

2835
03:56:25,129 --> 03:56:27,770
And then like every once in a while you come in my chat and you say hey

2836
03:56:28,250 --> 03:56:30,250
Give me a sub

2837
03:56:30,569 --> 03:56:32,569
And you'll get one

2838
03:56:33,690 --> 03:56:34,809
And then

2839
03:56:34,889 --> 03:56:39,940
You just leave I got a pearl

2840
03:56:42,649 --> 03:56:45,530
That way jeff bezos daddy bezos gets his money

2841
03:56:46,489 --> 03:56:48,489
Get in the core bar

2842
03:56:50,100 --> 03:56:53,129
That's the real goal

2843
03:56:53,129 --> 03:56:56,250
Well, I wanna all right. How about this? How about this is how this will work

2844
03:56:56,250 --> 03:56:59,610
Because if we just are giving subs to each other then we're just yeah

2845
03:57:00,170 --> 03:57:02,969
There's no reason for that. Just you give me 50 dollars

2846
03:57:03,690 --> 03:57:05,450
The next time I see you

2847
03:57:05,450 --> 03:57:09,530
Okay, so that'll cover like the year right whatever that'll cover like just called christmas

2848
03:57:10,489 --> 03:57:16,010
No, but then like next year like in two years i'll give you 50 dollars and like oh let's go to lunch

2849
03:57:16,090 --> 03:57:17,770
You know, i'll take you to lunch

2850
03:57:17,770 --> 03:57:21,930
Okay, so that's it's birthdays instead like I give you 50 dollars of stuff on your birthday

2851
03:57:22,010 --> 03:57:24,569
And then you give me 50 dollars of stuff on my birthday. Yeah

2852
03:57:24,809 --> 03:57:29,129
All right, so let's just celebrate each other's birthdays then like what's the big deal? When's my birthday?

04:06:26,899 --> 04:06:28,899
No, this is like spaghetti. Oh a little bit more

2951
04:06:31,110 --> 04:06:32,950
Egg

2952
04:06:32,950 --> 04:06:34,950
I recently watched that video

2953
04:06:36,709 --> 04:06:38,889
Again

2954
04:06:39,690 --> 04:06:41,690
All right with the egg

2955
04:06:43,450 --> 04:06:45,450
It's like right around us here somewhere like above us

2956
04:06:47,750 --> 04:06:49,239
egg

2957
04:06:49,239 --> 04:06:51,479
Eggu

2958
04:06:51,479 --> 04:06:56,680
I know it's on the map. I see it. It's just somewhere in here. It's like right here inside these tentacles

2959
04:06:56,760 --> 04:06:58,760
I'm pretty sure they're just like the uh pearls

2960
04:07:02,100 --> 04:07:04,280
Cool one egg

2961
04:07:04,280 --> 04:07:06,280
What why is it world shaking?

2962
04:07:06,280 --> 04:07:08,760
Oh because they don't like it when you take their eggs. All right next one

2963
04:07:08,760 --> 04:07:10,360
I'm gonna find my way to the next one

2964
04:07:10,360 --> 04:07:12,600
There's some weird thing over here. I don't know if it's an egg

2965
04:07:15,860 --> 04:07:17,860
Yeah, there's one up this way

2966
04:07:19,819 --> 04:07:21,940
Here follow me

2967
04:07:21,940 --> 04:07:24,340
Oh god, this is so stupid. I didn't know I knew

2968
04:07:25,459 --> 04:07:28,579
Oh, there's a bush over here red bush thing over here

2969
04:07:29,299 --> 04:07:31,299
Where is the supply bush?

2970
04:07:36,600 --> 04:07:38,569
nitrous full

2971
04:07:38,569 --> 04:07:44,969
Shit is he is the mule being taken?

2972
04:07:50,090 --> 04:07:52,809
We got we got a big bug problem. Oh my god

2973
04:07:54,790 --> 04:07:56,790
Yeah, i'm up here on the cliff doing what I can

2974
04:07:57,510 --> 04:08:10,360
Oh boy, this is not good

2975
04:08:10,520 --> 04:08:12,840
Even even if you run sometimes you gotta kill enemies

2976
04:08:15,219 --> 04:08:17,530
Sometimes i'm going like crazy

2977
04:08:27,639 --> 04:08:31,959
Um, is there a reason why you're mining and not like helping everybody waiting for the enemies to come up here

2978
04:08:31,959 --> 04:08:34,360
So I can go down there and resurrect you. Um, just

2979
04:08:35,479 --> 04:08:37,559
He's playing like a clicker game

2980
04:08:38,760 --> 04:08:44,860
I don't buy it until I see it

2981
04:08:44,860 --> 04:08:51,059
Are you getting shot by like our friendly bot? No, it is not a friendly bot

2982
04:08:51,139 --> 04:08:55,059
There is a super giant robot that is shooting everyone down here, which is why we're all dead

2983
04:08:57,879 --> 04:09:14,940
And it doesn't like oh my god i'm dead

2984
04:09:16,139 --> 04:09:18,219
Oh now it has a health bar. That's a lot of health

2985
04:09:19,420 --> 04:09:22,500
There's nowhere to really run

2986
04:09:22,500 --> 04:09:27,620
Ah, man, it looks like we're losing. I think there's the way to the bot. You gotta kill the bot. Kill the bot

2987
04:09:27,860 --> 04:09:29,860
I've done so fast. I have so much health I can't

2988
04:09:30,579 --> 04:09:32,579
So that's what what was happening. All right

2989
04:09:32,659 --> 04:09:37,299
Well, let's see what my real problem was as I res germa first again. Look guys. We really tried this time

2990
04:09:37,299 --> 04:09:42,579
Okay, swear. I mean that that's that's like that that that's not true. But what happened actually was

2991
04:09:43,299 --> 04:09:48,979
Um, we did nobody knew that we had to kill the robot that was running out loud said wow, that's a corrupted bot

2992
04:09:49,540 --> 04:09:51,540
I think it was muted. Did you shoot?

2993
04:09:53,270 --> 04:09:56,219
I didn't see you shoot at it. Uh

2994
04:09:56,379 --> 04:09:58,459
I've been shooting it

2995
04:09:58,459 --> 04:10:01,659
Oh now you are a squad stream. You can all see that i've been shooting it

2996
04:10:02,379 --> 04:10:04,379
I'm gonna get your germ

2997
04:10:04,459 --> 04:10:07,500
Thanks, ronny. Just gotta set my thing up here

2998
04:10:08,379 --> 04:10:17,530
Damn, I keep getting froze

2999
04:10:17,530 --> 04:10:22,010
I'm gonna kind of dig myself in a hole so I can have some cover star. Did you beat sekiro?

3000
04:10:23,590 --> 04:10:26,149
Uh, I got the last loss. I honestly I hate that game

3001
04:10:26,870 --> 04:10:28,870
Did you put on passion?

3002
04:10:30,229 --> 04:10:32,149
So I did not want to

3003
04:10:32,149 --> 04:10:33,909
Spend the time on the last guy

3004
04:10:33,909 --> 04:10:35,909
I'm trying to risk hold on

3005
04:10:39,000 --> 04:10:41,959
So so sure you can say not you're the better the game. You're a better gamer

3006
04:10:42,600 --> 04:10:45,159
I just was scared. I did it. I just I was curious to play it

3007
04:10:46,059 --> 04:10:48,059
I didn't get your thoughts on it

3008
04:10:49,530 --> 04:10:52,489
My thoughts I didn't get your thoughts apparently you don't like it

3009
04:10:53,690 --> 04:11:03,719
No

3010
04:11:03,719 --> 04:11:08,040
Whoa, that kind of hurts my head. Oh god. This guy looks like short circuit

3011
04:11:10,489 --> 04:11:11,690
Oh

3012
04:11:11,690 --> 04:11:15,260
All right, it's dead

3013
04:11:15,260 --> 04:11:18,819
Restart it. Yes. Let's repair our enemy

3014
04:11:23,340 --> 04:11:29,020
But oh shoot is it a walking turret now without uh without any like obviously spoilers. I think it took me like

3015
04:11:29,579 --> 04:11:30,860
what 50

3016
04:11:30,860 --> 04:11:32,860
60 attempts at that final boss

3017
04:11:34,709 --> 04:11:36,309
That's insane

3018
04:11:36,309 --> 04:11:38,309
There's a final boss spoiler

3019
04:11:38,549 --> 04:11:39,750
Spoiler

3020
04:11:39,750 --> 04:11:41,750
Well, I didn't want to say what it is

3021
04:11:42,549 --> 04:11:44,389
Did you fight like?

3022
04:11:44,389 --> 04:11:46,709
Did you fight? Um, he's already

3023
04:11:47,989 --> 04:11:49,989
The big red fire demon. Yes

3024
04:11:50,709 --> 04:11:55,450
Okay, i'm not digging out of here

3025
04:11:55,530 --> 04:12:00,790
Only two out of six eggs. How long has it been?

3026
04:12:02,069 --> 04:12:04,069
I don't know. I was reading chat

3027
04:12:06,420 --> 04:12:08,420
I don't even know where I am

3028
04:12:08,500 --> 04:12:18,409
It's too dark

3029
04:12:18,409 --> 04:12:22,250
All right. We do we have we have we have we need one more egg in this area

3030
04:12:22,250 --> 04:12:25,190
Go over here. Where is it?

3031
04:12:25,190 --> 04:12:29,030
Yeah, I do. There's one up. There's one down. I'm gonna I'm gonna get the one that's up

3032
04:12:29,909 --> 04:12:37,290
That is weird. I have yet to see an egg. I have no idea what they look like inside the giant flesh ball

3033
04:12:38,489 --> 04:12:40,569
You have to dig and there's eggs inside of them

3034
04:12:42,090 --> 04:12:46,139
But if you press the tab on your map it shows you exactly where they are

3035
04:12:47,579 --> 04:12:49,579
And then you have to dig into

3036
04:12:50,059 --> 04:13:04,950
All right, what was that one?

3037
04:13:04,950 --> 04:13:06,229
low

3038
04:13:11,219 --> 04:13:17,139
Anyone keeping track of how many times i've explained this what the fuck did you get it? Um at least one

3039
04:13:17,620 --> 04:13:19,620
Oh, did you what'd you do with it?

3040
04:13:26,120 --> 04:13:37,129
How did you get in here back that way dude, it's i'm fucking in the room of mirrors right now

3041
04:13:48,920 --> 04:13:50,920
Oh

3042
04:13:51,959 --> 04:13:54,600
No, wait, why what the fuck

3043
04:13:56,219 --> 04:14:01,129
Goddamn minecraft. Oh shit. All right, i'm fine

3044
04:14:02,090 --> 04:14:05,030
Uh, we're gonna need

3045
04:14:05,989 --> 04:14:11,299
Pretty much everything i'm on it

3046
04:14:15,819 --> 04:14:16,780
Okay

3047
04:14:16,780 --> 04:14:18,780
I'm gaming with the where's the last two?

3048
04:14:20,100 --> 04:14:22,100
But they're like up this way

3049
04:14:23,059 --> 04:14:30,309
You're voting to kick me

3050
04:14:30,309 --> 04:14:32,309
I own I own the server

3051
04:14:32,870 --> 04:14:36,010
It's gonna take more than that

3052
04:14:38,819 --> 04:14:42,819
What is this bot doing? Because I have not seen it shooting at any bugs. It's kind of running around

3053
04:14:43,989 --> 04:14:45,989
Oh, i'm skiing around now

3054
04:14:45,989 --> 04:14:49,510
Yeah lag guy uses god mode in his own server

3055
04:14:51,110 --> 04:14:53,819
All right, this is really weird. I really am on skis

3056
04:15:03,239 --> 04:15:06,250
Um, it's ice

3057
04:15:06,409 --> 04:15:09,450
Yeah, it's gonna say aren't you from uh, boston. It's ice

3058
04:15:11,459 --> 04:15:14,340
I thought I was in boston. I thought I would like it

3059
04:15:18,020 --> 04:15:21,700
Uh, is there one more I can get that you have not got i'm gonna just go to the one behind me

3060
04:15:22,260 --> 04:15:32,309
There's two behind me here

3061
04:15:32,389 --> 04:15:34,549
This game reminds me of like war frame

3062
04:15:35,879 --> 04:15:37,239
War frame

3063
04:15:37,239 --> 04:15:40,680
Yeah, because you drop in you do an objective you're with four other people or three people

3064
04:15:41,879 --> 04:15:46,120
And he's like, oh you got you got to hack like three nodes and you're like, how did I hack three of them?

3065
04:15:46,920 --> 04:15:48,979
What did everyone else do?

3066
04:15:48,979 --> 04:15:50,979
I'm over on this too. I'm getting gold

3067
04:15:52,069 --> 04:15:55,610
Good job

3068
04:15:55,610 --> 04:15:59,850
Have you had prior experience though in warframe? I didn't have any experience. Actually. No, I did

3069
04:15:59,850 --> 04:16:01,850
I played for like five minutes with you and said no

3070
04:16:04,680 --> 04:16:07,799
Uh, not that the game is bad. I just was like no i'm all right

3071
04:16:08,440 --> 04:16:12,579
I just do you have a swarm on the way. All right. This is bad just protect

3072
04:16:14,579 --> 04:16:17,780
We have a supply

3073
04:16:17,780 --> 04:16:19,780
Uh, I called one down earlier

3074
04:16:21,290 --> 04:16:26,010
So it's it's way over there war frame is really really cool. I just couldn't get into it

3075
04:16:30,760 --> 04:16:41,020
Should we stick together for this swarm? We only need one more egg

3076
04:16:41,979 --> 04:16:47,100
And it's above four out of six eggs. Yeah, but there's one there's one thrown down. There's one up here

3077
04:16:48,059 --> 04:16:50,069
You're gonna break the egg

3078
04:16:50,069 --> 04:16:53,909
We'll throw the other egg down here then I mean I have another one. I don't want to go get it

3079
04:16:54,069 --> 04:16:56,229
It's up above us. It's like I don't want to go get it

3080
04:16:56,309 --> 04:16:59,110
It was like a swarm coming you want to get stuck in a hole somewhere and die

3081
04:17:11,750 --> 04:17:15,590
Oh now the uh, the the big monster tank is shooting things

3082
04:17:21,780 --> 04:17:26,020
All right, i'll go now. So where is it? I don't see it on the map. Oh, it's up this way

3083
04:17:26,500 --> 04:17:28,500
I'm gonna go try to get it

3084
04:17:28,500 --> 04:17:32,729
I mean I am the drill guy

3085
04:17:36,540 --> 04:17:38,969
What I can't go through this

3086
04:17:39,049 --> 04:17:41,049
um, okay weird

3087
04:17:41,610 --> 04:17:43,610
Why you're almost through the wave

3088
04:17:44,969 --> 04:17:57,989
I'm trying to go up trying to go through it. I don't have any fuel shit. That's why

3089
04:17:58,950 --> 04:18:02,729
That's all right. He can do it. He's played warframe before

3090
04:18:08,090 --> 04:18:10,090
Very good. Very good job. Very good

3091
04:18:12,090 --> 04:18:20,340
He turned around

3092
04:18:31,590 --> 04:18:33,590
Good

3093
04:18:33,829 --> 04:18:36,229
Where is the aforementioned supply pod?

3094
04:18:36,389 --> 04:18:39,510
What there is not a supply pod, I don't think

3095
04:18:44,379 --> 04:18:45,739
There it is

3096
04:18:45,739 --> 04:18:47,420
Where is it down?

3097
04:18:47,420 --> 04:18:49,420
All we have to do now is leave

3098
04:18:50,899 --> 04:18:52,899
Oh, I have zero bullets. So

3099
04:18:54,010 --> 04:18:56,010
Let's get some bullets excellent

3100
04:18:58,680 --> 04:19:00,680
Eggs excellent get it

3101
04:19:01,479 --> 04:19:03,479
egg

3102
04:19:04,280 --> 04:19:06,280
Egg

3103
04:19:08,389 --> 04:19:10,389
Egg there we go. That was better

3104
04:19:10,469 --> 04:19:13,590
Kind of hybrid everyone's right here. So we don't even have to go far

3105
04:19:18,819 --> 04:19:21,780
Stuart can you tell italics that he's the sexiest dreamer here for me

3106
04:19:23,219 --> 04:19:24,360
Wow

3107
04:19:24,360 --> 04:19:26,360
I mean, I already knew that but it still helps to hear

3108
04:19:29,639 --> 04:19:33,450
Uh, that was my mom. It's bullshit, by the way

3109
04:19:39,500 --> 04:19:49,540
I thought star's the only one up there

3110
04:19:51,270 --> 04:19:52,709
I was

3111
04:19:52,709 --> 04:19:55,270
He's just kind of we're just like playing

3112
04:19:56,069 --> 04:19:58,069
Hide and go seek down here

3113
04:19:58,229 --> 04:20:07,110
I think what's actually happening is we're all relying on someone else to lead so we can follow and read chat

3179
04:24:57,030 --> 04:24:59,030

So I got time to do it. I want to make sure I got out of there to be able to do it

3190
04:25:39,340 --> 04:25:41,739
That was fun. That was deep rock galactic actually was pretty fun

3191
04:25:42,379 --> 04:25:45,299
It's a nice take

3192
04:25:45,299 --> 04:25:47,299
On like the left for dead model

3193
04:25:48,100 --> 04:25:52,819
But let's go back to a few hours ago here. We had elizabeth for three bucks

3194
04:25:54,149 --> 04:25:55,270
Uh, hello

3195
04:25:55,270 --> 04:26:00,069
I just wanted to chip in and say that I recently got my dream job as a community manager for a game dev

3196
04:26:01,079 --> 04:26:04,120
Which also is sister company with the ones who publish deep rock

3197
04:26:05,079 --> 04:26:08,120
Pogchamp so cool to see you play and loving all your streams. Oh, that's awesome

3198

Congratulations on that. Thank you so much for the three bucks. Hell. Yeah

3205
04:26:49,920 --> 04:26:51,920
early 2013

3206
04:26:52,420 --> 04:26:54,420
I have a question if that's okay

3207
04:26:54,420 --> 04:26:57,940
I'm lucky enough to be visiting america for the first time boston specifically

3208
04:26:58,420 --> 04:27:01,379
And I was wondering if you had any tips places to go things to do etc

3209
04:27:02,440 --> 04:27:03,879
um

3210
04:27:03,879 --> 04:27:07,399
For boston, I mean the museum of science is awesome if you've never been

3211
04:27:08,340 --> 04:27:11,700
boston museum of science is really really cool a lot of interesting things to see and do there

3212
04:27:15,799 --> 04:27:17,799
museum museum

3213
04:27:19,180 --> 04:27:23,180
Yeah, it is an awesome place if you have some time you could spend

3214
04:27:23,899 --> 04:27:26,540
All day there you could spend more than one two three days there

3215
04:27:29,719 --> 04:27:31,719
So if somebody that was coming

3216
04:27:32,040 --> 04:27:34,040
To america to boston

3217
04:27:34,120 --> 04:27:39,750

I'll be watching you do your thing with your wonderfully twisted brand of humor

3251
04:29:42,459 --> 04:29:47,420
When suddenly my mom comes in with my tendies and she sees me twerking, but it's not like she doesn't approve of my

3252
04:29:48,139 --> 04:29:49,659
Shaking. In fact, she's a bit supportive

3253
04:29:49,659 --> 04:29:54,700
She thinks I should quit my delivery job and just do twerking full time. I don't know where I could get paid

3254
04:29:56,860 --> 04:29:58,620

I had a zoom and that's not a joke

3276
04:31:31,799 --> 04:31:41,590
But thank you ipod matt. I hope you enjoy your ipod

3277
04:31:43,110 --> 04:31:45,590
Yeah, this that was nothing wrong with the zoom

3278
04:31:47,260 --> 04:31:49,659
People think that's a joke though when you tell them that

3279
04:31:51,770 --> 04:31:55,049
But thank you. Thank you marvosh mcgally for the 250. Thanks for the eu stream

04:31:59,139 --> 04:32:02,340
If I do them and i'm able to do them and I can kind of change the schedule around and

3282
04:32:02,739 --> 04:32:05,059
I mean obviously this stream was eu friendly

3283
04:32:05,860 --> 04:32:08,979
Not out of essentially choice, but out of necessity

3284
04:32:09,780 --> 04:32:15,979
But it's nice to do them every so often i'm gonna get the credits to roll by here

I didn't i haven't seen it pop up

3305
04:33:36,860 --> 04:33:40,419
We have to get documented evidence that it's happened

3306
04:33:42,090 --> 04:33:44,090
Because I we needed the date

3307
04:33:45,049 --> 04:33:49,369
God he's got me. He's in my head now. I like i'm thinking about me doing that and it's happening

3308
04:33:52,900 --> 04:33:56,500
He's in there. He's in there like laughing and mocking me right now

3309
04:34:01,849 --> 04:34:09,860
Uh, no, that was fun. He's in there rent free. Yeah

3310
04:34:14,419 --> 04:34:19,459
He cancelled the sub. No, he didn't it was a gift. It's you can't cancel a gifted sub. Can you?

3311
04:34:21,099 --> 04:34:23,740
You can't go into your account and cancel a gift sub

3312
04:34:24,380 --> 04:34:26,979
Is that impossible?

3313
04:34:26,979 --> 04:34:28,619
You can

04:34:28,619 --> 04:34:32,520

04:34:36,090 --> 04:34:38,090
15 seconds of the credits

3318
04:34:44,889 --> 04:34:48,650
What if he cancelled his sub to have like the token to give to somebody else?

3319
04:34:49,209 --> 04:34:54,709
That's so funny

3320
04:34:54,709 --> 04:35:08,659
