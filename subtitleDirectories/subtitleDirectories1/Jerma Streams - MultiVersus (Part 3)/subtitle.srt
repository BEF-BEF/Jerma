00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:12,680
Loud. I'll fix it. I don't want it to be too loud.

39
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:23,540
This is a sponsored segment of the stream, yes.

00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:31,199
And it's fucking awesome.

41
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,399
Okay, hold on.

42
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,610
I gotta get it correct.

Let's go! Alright, so yeah.

48
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,470
If you- let's do some 1v1s.

49
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,990
To warm up a little. And take a look.

50
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,810
LeBron James is in the game.

51
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,500
And he's fun as fuck.

52
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,459
I've already played it. I've- I- look.

53
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:24,129
I've been messing around in the Xbox version.

54
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:26,129
And I'm ready. LeBron James

55
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:29,379
has this dunk move that you

56
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:31,379
just need to touch somebody with it.

57
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:34,959
And it's over. Let's fucking kick some ass.

58
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,199
You ready? Thank you, obviously Warner Bros.

59
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,199

60
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,199
I mean, I love this game. I genuinely do.

61
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,199
You guys all know that. You already know that at this point.

62
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,459
You're gonna blame your controller now.

63
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:49,600
No, watch this. Watch- I'll show you in the lab.

64
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,910
It's so surreal.

65
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,069
Watch this. Oh, what's that? Oh, excuse me.

66
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:01,069
Okay, whatever. I'll show you- I'll show you how you play.

67
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,980
You're gonna blame chat?

68
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:10,610
Yeah, I'm level one.

69
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,850
But we'll go up.

70
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,850
We'll go up.

71
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,980
Instant loss incoming.

72
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,980
Well, now I gave myself an opportunity

73
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,980
for failure, which was a bad idea.

74
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,110
Here we go.

75
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,110
Don't get in my head already. I haven't even started playing.

76
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,740
Don't get in my head.

77
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:52,829
Let's go. Oh, what's that?

78
00:06:52,829 --> 00:07:03,519
Oh, excuse me. Oh, get dunked on.

That move is sick. Good dodge.

81
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:32,000
It's alright.

82
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:46,269

127
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:59,710
you lose that's just the way it is but i like the way he plays it's funny why are you throwing

128
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:12,450
throwing i came back i was down by 80 points i came back i was down by 80 points i came back

129
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:34,819
just old man reactions do the air neutral more with uh with or without the ball from one to ten

130
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:43,019
how do you rate yourself as a gamer eight and a half super mario two dark souls games eight

131
00:22:45,250 --> 00:23:14,980
and then it averages out after that oh my god i'm getting fucking annihilated oh my god i can't

132
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:33,309
even play the game how do i let him do that and does that move not go through anything

145
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:31,500

146
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:37,710

00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:14,769
character whatever that's finn what i thought jake and finn from adventure time what's this

160
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:27,549
all right he's gonna eat the basketball isn't it a bunch it's gonna be bad jake the human and

161
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:36,640
in the dog i know all right here we go i'm going for it and we're gonna it's gonna be a good match

162
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:45,200
check it out i promise i promise it's gonna be a good match don't flip these cats in the bag

163
00:32:45,200 --> 00:33:14,259
i've already fucked it up i must have spilled off the fucking stage what how did he eat me what's

164
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:43,730
going on here what just happened not bad that's how you drink whoa i went across the map in a

165
00:33:43,730 --> 00:34:47,630
second something's going on here uh something's going on here what the hit that taz no where are

166
00:34:47,630 --> 00:35:11,630
we we did it that was messy but we did it okay nice job good fight good fight continue

167
00:35:15,409 --> 00:35:19,090
i got the kills that's all that matters all that matters is the uh the number at top

168
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:27,230
nothing else does choose your character hey dude just tuning in is this guy pro lebron

169
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:45,860
what's up doc you tested me today and i understand has his spin is op i think they nerfed it they uh

170
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:52,260
they made it way way less powerful in the last batch it's still really good but not as nearly

171
00:35:52,260 --> 00:36:04,369
as good as it was it seems like they're really on top of patching the game every week or two

172
00:36:04,369 --> 00:36:09,360
so that's good that's good every uh every week or two i see a new patch with nerfs and buffs and

173
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:27,280
stuff so it's good they're gonna make it a cool down move that makes sense it's only been one

174
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:40,079
week it's a lot of fun though be really honest with me how many you guys have ones in the chat

175
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:45,010
if you guys have actually downloaded this and went like this on the couch fuck it's good

176
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:52,800
wait be honest actually be honest that's what i did

177
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:29,500
oh all right oh my goodness i just got absolutely double teamed that move has no priority though

178
00:37:30,139 --> 00:37:35,710
i mean i i get why it's so powerful but you got to catch people really off guard with it

179
00:37:40,269 --> 00:37:44,429
you can pass the ball to your teammate too which is really cool oops i didn't want to do that

180
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:49,739
all right oh my god i thought it was over

181
00:38:14,019 --> 00:38:33,599
i tried my hardest it's all right jump into it shit

182
00:38:46,400 --> 00:39:14,989
oh you got so lucky there you go sir remember because you went in a fight against a grizzly bear

183
00:39:15,869 --> 00:39:27,539
yep i think so when it just feels right i think enough like

184
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:39,150
you know like the every beat-em-up sound you've ever heard if the bear comes up with the claws

185
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:47,599
all i have to do is just go go go go go go go go go and i'll be able to knock him down

186
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:58,449
guys i would die instantly i would die in one hit the bear would swipe me across the face and my

187
00:39:58,449 --> 00:40:06,610
face would come off of course i can't fight a bear i think i'm kidding it's a joke i would

188
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:18,369
get up with my hands like this and then my whole head would be gone but you can dodge an axe yeah

189
00:40:18,369 --> 00:40:30,210
an axe is not a grizzly bear there of axe is not a a person has to swing the axe all right i want

190
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:43,260
to do all right lebron or or bugs you want to see more lebron gameplay he's so fun to play he

191
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:51,380
really is i just not very good with them lebron means you'll lose i just wanted to enroll lebron

192
00:40:51,380 --> 00:41:04,539
on the team i'll do lebron again no time like the present tom and jerry i tried to play tom and jerry

193
00:41:04,539 --> 00:41:09,710
they were kind of weird they remind me the ice climbers but you need to pay attention essentially

194
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:14,900
to both ice climbers at the same time it's like both it's like if you put the ice climbers away

195
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:23,780
from each other and they both have different moves it's uh if my brain just has trouble doing it

196
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:32,030
they're cool though should you purchase multiverses well multiverses is free an open beta right now

00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:52,849
maybe four episodes of the office total i've never seen that show in fact i just watched a

245
00:56:52,849 --> 00:56:57,650
full episode of the office one day when ed helms was the guy that was in charge of everything and

246
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:16,769
i was like okay this is one full episode i watched that was a mistake i think the problem that i

256
01:00:38,269 --> 01:00:41,789

257
01:00:41,789 --> 01:00:48,800

359
01:45:01,489 --> 01:45:09,579
the music in this game especially the main menu it reminds me of being at like six flags right and

360
01:45:09,659 --> 01:45:16,159
you hear that music just playing everywhere you get a corn dog it feels very amusement parkish

361
01:45:16,159 --> 01:45:27,699
i love it i feel like i'm at the in the line for the superman ride you know what i mean

362
01:45:27,699 --> 01:45:49,090
i love it let's get a new emote wonder woman weightlifting all right i've got an 80 recent

363
01:45:49,090 --> 01:46:02,800
win rate this is pretty good i'm only two million one hundred eighty nine thousand look at your

364
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:12,989
bugs bunny rank how do you do that all right because it looks like it's velma how do i see

365
01:46:12,989 --> 01:46:41,359
the one v one all right let's take velma into the lab all right so velma's got a couple of cool

366
01:46:41,359 --> 01:46:47,979
moves her basic attack is ranged so you have to target somebody and then you can just kind of pop

367
01:46:47,979 --> 01:46:57,100
pop pop pop and then that's on cooldown all right let's see velma shouts a word bubble projectile

368
01:46:57,100 --> 01:47:00,939
that seeks out her ally if the bubble hits any fighter ally or enemy they become targeted and

369
01:47:00,939 --> 01:47:05,979
additional bubbles will lock on to their target their location allies who become targeted will

370
01:47:05,979 --> 01:47:16,060
also briefly gain hastened all right so that's a support move so it's a heal all right so the

371
01:47:16,060 --> 01:47:22,819
ammo which is replenished itself uh side x is a combo of quips yeah that move is good too this

372
01:47:22,819 --> 01:47:31,119
one here that's what that could that i honestly think that's the best uh combo in the game it's

373
01:47:31,119 --> 01:47:40,989
got such insane range look at the range on this like that's insane you can't get away from this

374
01:47:40,989 --> 01:47:47,970
it takes a long time to charge up that shit so i'm not going to do it too much okay what about

375
01:47:47,970 --> 01:47:59,390
down yeah this is the whack okay and the idea bubble you know what you really can do to screw

376
01:47:59,390 --> 01:48:05,380
with somebody so you get them in the air and then just start throwing these out there and

377
01:48:05,380 --> 01:48:15,779
just pop pop pop pop boom okay cool i like the combos what about the air moves whoa that's pretty

378
01:48:15,779 --> 01:48:28,640
good that's just okay cool this one's like a dive it's got a lot of bounce to it and you can charge

379
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:38,590
this too that is a stuff move if you got somebody going around the corner here and you just stuff

380
01:48:38,590 --> 01:48:46,399
right there okay what about specials so that i've said because you got to collect these things right

381
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:53,949
what does it do motivational speech beam projectile that repeatedly hits enemies and heals allies all

382
01:48:53,949 --> 01:49:00,319
right the final hit of the beam applies targeted if the final hit lands on an ally it will fire

383
01:49:00,319 --> 01:49:09,359
an additional beam okay or if it hits the full stack they get weakened okay you can aim the beam

384
01:49:09,359 --> 01:49:21,390
up or down so it's just like a okay is this one too was this okay here we go yep is there a cool

385
01:49:21,390 --> 01:49:38,510
down on that there is no cool down on that so dude all right target watch this well i screwed it up

386
01:49:38,510 --> 01:49:48,350
you know what i mean that's i think that'd be pretty cool uh cool combo maybe not flashlight

387
01:49:48,350 --> 01:49:55,760
okay cool so that's what that does you carry them over to the edge allies can hop into the arms to

388
01:49:56,500 --> 01:50:04,020
increasing attack power all right toxic goop on the ground and jumps upward enemies standing in

389
01:50:04,020 --> 01:50:11,739
the goop will receive continuous stacks of ice all right or it's you snap a picture

390
01:50:12,619 --> 01:50:22,079
melma snaps a picture downward with a camera that sends her and enemies upward breaking armor applies

391
01:50:22,079 --> 01:50:44,770
weak really that seems what's the range on it all right that seems insane that's a kill move

392
01:50:44,770 --> 01:50:52,609
okay so that throws ice on the ground if you don't if you're not in the air so that i gotta

393
01:50:52,609 --> 01:50:58,689
remember that down is spread the knowledge projectile that homes over an ally you get

394
01:50:58,689 --> 01:51:03,710
educated if the book hits them reducing the duration of their cooldowns okay so when everything's on

395
01:51:03,710 --> 01:51:12,800
cooldown you just kind of throw the book down all right i think i'm ready give it a try i think i'm

396
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:19,340
good to go wait is there anything else to look at all right during the match evidence will appear

397
01:51:19,340 --> 01:51:26,109
and some of velma's moves spawn evidence so you can pick it up you fill the evidence meter so when

398
01:51:26,109 --> 01:51:30,430
the meter is full velma can call a police car the police will seek out the nearest enemy disable

399
01:51:30,430 --> 01:51:38,100
them and drive off the map and do it do this while crouching how do you activate that though

400
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:51,979
that seems insane all right let's do it do some velma gameplay she calls the cops yeah we'll do

401
01:51:51,979 --> 01:52:12,180
one v one here comes the heat i forgot about taz come on pick character there's velma's here

402
01:52:20,750 --> 01:52:34,960
also again if you play the game all your progress is kept through open beta stop doing your funny

403
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:45,010
voice i didn't do anything okay let's see if i can make anything happen here headphones going in

404
01:52:57,149 --> 01:55:10,720
gaming time gaming time oh shit i forgot i had that move what the fuck are you going all right

405
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:34,800
let's go what the fuck is happening why can't i leave the stage i can't get off the stage man

406
01:55:35,600 --> 01:56:21,550
i almost got him i think i almost got him all right seriously what the hell is going on

407
01:56:22,510 --> 01:56:37,619
what's actually happening why do i have so much dude you could go buy a boat with the amount of

408
01:56:37,619 --> 01:57:15,100
money you have right now jump off i wanted to get to a thousand and i'll jump off what you can't go

409
01:57:15,100 --> 01:58:26,670
more than a thousand what we good i think that was a little um out of the ordinary i don't think that

410
01:58:26,670 --> 01:59:01,310
one counts i don't think that's possible okay come on pick character i don't have enough the

411
01:59:01,310 --> 01:59:29,340
king now sure i'll take it what do you mean votes immediately started to go to no after you picked

442
02:13:59,060 --> 02:14:17,659
voice i don't know why i thought that was batman i was like that's he doesn't start time okay now

443
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:22,319
the voice is completely makes sense i just i don't know why batman was the one talking and

444
02:14:22,319 --> 02:14:56,529
i'm like this doesn't really sound like me i'll beat you without oh they actually talk shit to each

445
02:14:56,529 --> 02:15:12,590
other

446
02:15:43,229 --> 02:16:27,279
should have gone up should have gone up what an idiot oh what a colossal fucking battle what a

447
02:16:27,279 --> 02:17:28,860
colossal battle shit what the hell is going on here ah i could have went down stop talking

448
02:17:28,860 --> 02:18:02,379
shit to me feel like you're in my chat that was your character i whatever i keep thinking it's

449
02:18:02,379 --> 02:18:26,350
batman this is a fun game i'm telling you i'm so sweaty superman's really tanky very heavy

450
02:18:32,700 --> 02:18:42,500
come on pick character let's do it again let's all fight fair and this should be fun how come you

451
02:18:42,500 --> 02:19:03,309
look like you made it a soap i don't know i don't know do i it's kind of weird i gotta stop okay my

452
02:19:03,309 --> 02:19:11,700
biggest problem with these games is panic dodging i get up there we get in the air and i just go oh

453
02:19:11,700 --> 02:19:17,040
my god oh my god oh my god and i gotta stop doing that the panic dodges are what's getting me killed

454
02:19:17,040 --> 02:19:34,739
are you gonna play anything else tonight probably not probably not we'll come back with uh we'll

455
02:19:34,739 --> 02:19:46,030
come back with sorcery in a couple days maybe on uh monday i completely forgot i played the hitman

456
02:19:46,030 --> 02:21:29,520
map that's weird walked away stay back oh i thought i got him really powerful actually powerful the

457
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:35,200
move his moves just hit so hard with those powers shaggy someone could get hurt play again

458
02:21:35,840 --> 02:21:43,059
go ahead how come you went live when i went to the movies

459
02:21:45,379 --> 02:21:47,920
because we were trying to get a stream in before you showed up

460
02:21:53,100 --> 02:22:03,200
that was rude i'm just messing around of course i want everyone that's here to be here

461
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:11,469
it's me making a joke as long as i'm standing you can count on me oh when's green okay green

462
02:22:11,469 --> 02:22:17,139
screen part two movie night is going to be on next weekend uh we're probably going to go on

463
02:22:17,139 --> 02:22:22,659
friday or saturday so the fifth the sixth right let me see check the date it'll be the fifth of

464
02:22:22,659 --> 02:22:29,860
the sixth we'll come back with another probably one to 200 videos gonna be insane and then sorcery

465
02:22:29,860 --> 02:22:37,389
we'll do some more of uh kare that'll be on monday maybe we'll do monday tuesday well maybe we'll do

466
02:22:37,389 --> 02:22:54,270

467
02:22:54,270 --> 02:23:20,290
no i've not seen a harley quinn in a long time

468
02:24:12,959 --> 02:24:21,309
oh almost i'm goner i'm a goner

469
02:24:58,319 --> 02:25:34,110
oh shit nice dodge damn i got outplayed too i really did i actually got outplayed that whole

470
02:25:34,110 --> 02:25:41,200
entire game i just got a couple of uh good smashes that's it for someone without powers

471
02:25:41,200 --> 02:25:56,959
you still pack quite the punch okay come on pick character he seems like he's pre-recorded

472
02:25:59,600 --> 02:26:20,239
we'll do taz didn't i own taz did i not own taz before i have level three here comes the heat

473
02:26:25,459 --> 02:26:36,860
oh is the free character rotation right that makes sense i think you might be stupid enough

474
02:26:36,860 --> 02:27:01,860
to be a taz main show him what we got funny guy taz is low tier now i don't think so

475
02:27:32,290 --> 02:29:13,889
how did i fuck that up holy shit what happened i told you we got this that was ridiculous what

476
02:29:13,889 --> 02:29:37,489
happened just went flying that was insane i don't think i did that much damage dude it's you know

477
02:29:37,489 --> 02:29:42,959
what it's fun to sit here and just play a video game and just try to play it well i feel like it's

478
02:29:42,959 --> 02:29:50,000
been forever since i've tried to do this i feel like it's been ages since i've cared to play a

479
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:55,139
game and try to play it well does that make sense does anybody feel that way or am i just getting

480
02:29:55,139 --> 02:30:00,850
old here comes the heat elden ring yeah i mean multiplayer though playing against somebody else

481
02:30:00,850 --> 02:30:25,920
i'll do it again i'm not gonna play this game competitively ever i never will but i can't wait

482
02:30:25,920 --> 02:30:32,739
to watch the people that do especially the teams there's no way they're not going to do some kind

483
02:30:32,739 --> 02:30:39,219
of interesting stuff with the game right there's no way i'm looking forward to watching this game

484
02:30:39,219 --> 02:31:03,569
oh all right i hope it's successful it's really great game i do too i hope it's successful as

485
02:31:03,569 --> 02:31:11,379
well i mean it's gonna come down to how much support the game has in the next you know six

486
02:31:11,379 --> 02:31:18,290
to twelve months looks like it has a lot i mean wasn't this one of the most played fighting games

487
02:31:18,370 --> 02:31:22,850
ever on steam isn't i've never seen this like a screenshot am i wrong

488
02:32:30,260 --> 02:32:32,049
all right all right

489
02:33:10,829 --> 02:33:27,540
good combo good combo oh you're almost a snack you're almost the turkey turkey

490
02:33:53,059 --> 02:34:22,209
oh shit i'm almost a turkey we got this and the turkey attack nope you can just run around

491
02:34:39,149 --> 02:34:54,879
tasmanian andy i thought that was a good match i did i thought that was a good fight

492
02:34:54,879 --> 02:35:17,760
here comes the heat adventure time i move around a lot i do i know when i play games like this i have

493
02:35:17,760 --> 02:35:36,340
to move around it's the game the game is inside of me batman feels low tier to me is that wrong

494
02:35:36,340 --> 02:35:50,670
to say like batman doesn't have very many moves doesn't feel high tier am i wrong he has trouble

495
02:35:50,670 --> 02:36:07,299
killing at least in one v ones show them what we got batman is top you are ass you don't even

496
02:36:07,299 --> 02:36:55,170
want you to give the screen turned off i think you're the toughest i've gone up against i try

497
02:36:55,170 --> 02:37:23,549
to get it

498
02:38:01,629 --> 02:38:11,229
i got i was getting juggled a lot too is there a campaign mode i don't think there is a campaign

499
02:38:11,229 --> 02:38:28,129
mode nothing i'm aware of prepare for my debt defying exploits how can we always look so upset

500
02:38:31,389 --> 02:38:38,000
i mean i i'm walking in gamer wise is that what it is you know holly said this to me too

501
02:38:38,559 --> 02:38:43,520
she's like no seriously like if you watch you play a game that you're really really focusing on

502
02:38:44,159 --> 02:38:51,920
it looks like you're going to headbutt the screen i'm just like what i just sit there like i have to

503
02:38:51,920 --> 02:39:02,739
focus why is your chat so weird shall we dance i don't think they're that weird i mean some of

504
02:39:02,739 --> 02:40:32,059
them are i wanted it so bad press the button we're even man we're even we both want the same

505
02:40:32,059 --> 02:40:56,540

506
02:40:56,540 --> 02:41:39,920
trouble oh i almost got it no no no no no no no no that was a huge hitbox yeah it was

507
02:41:42,559 --> 02:41:53,260
i'm having more fun watching you hop around in your seat i get i get really into this

508
02:41:53,260 --> 02:42:08,579
shit man i'm sorry i really just do but it feels it feels good to play fighting games always play

509
02:42:08,579 --> 02:42:15,139
like such ass online it's just i've never even cared i've never cared to even play one because

510
02:42:15,139 --> 02:42:19,579
i'll jump into online and it's like why would i ever do this this sucks it doesn't feel like

511
02:42:19,579 --> 02:42:24,059
that this game does not feel like that at all it just doesn't i have to be up front let's be

512
02:42:24,059 --> 02:42:52,670
honest i'm here to defend justice the netcode yeah it's really hard to do it i mean look there's

513
02:42:52,670 --> 02:42:56,909
been some times where the game's been a little laggy teleporting around and weird shit happening

514
02:42:56,909 --> 02:43:03,299
but i would say 90 probably like 80 to 90 percent of all the games that i've played in this game

515
02:43:03,299 --> 02:43:08,000
i've played pretty normally as if i was sitting next to the person that i was playing against

516
02:43:09,979 --> 02:43:21,950
so that's encouraging and honestly the servers are are getting hammered right now

517
02:43:21,950 --> 02:43:34,299
this just went into open beta there are a ton of people playing this game so it's

518
02:43:36,479 --> 02:44:24,020
holding up pretty well let's go all right all right okay all right okay oh shit did i hit it

519
02:44:24,020 --> 02:45:18,690
back at him damn it anti-superman land b yikes oh nice kick nice that was a good play that was

520
02:45:18,690 --> 02:46:09,059
a good play it was what are we doing all right all right pull it together pull together that

521
02:46:09,059 --> 02:46:30,459
freak down we got this oh my god that was so scary bugs is getting nerfed in a week that's all right

522
02:46:30,459 --> 02:46:47,329
he's really strong bugs is very strong yeah i get fin on that nerf too play tom and jerry

523
02:46:53,709 --> 02:47:00,500
actually fin is probably in a good place i would i would imagine they probably just need to they

524
02:47:00,500 --> 02:47:10,850
need to bring a few people up i think genuinely i can't think of a character that i think is not

525
02:47:10,850 --> 02:47:20,510
worth playing i don't think so i mean maybe lebron feels a little weak but his brand new character

526
02:47:21,149 --> 02:47:33,700
who is genuinely terrible i don't think there's anybody that's genuinely awful rain dog is this

527
02:47:33,700 --> 02:47:45,409
character not great wonder woman sucks really on team teams though rain dog is probably really

528
02:47:45,409 --> 02:47:55,280
good aria feels really interesting too i want to try aria i was trained by the greatest swordsman

529

544
02:55:47,219 --> 02:55:50,100

684
03:48:55,309 --> 03:48:58,110
You jump again when you made the ledge and you just fall to your death.

685
03:48:58,110 --> 03:48:59,110
Ah!

686
03:48:59,110 --> 03:49:02,979
Here comes the heat!

687
03:49:02,979 --> 03:49:04,459
Okay, I'm not going to end on a loss.

688
03:49:04,459 --> 03:49:13,760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

689
03:49:13,760 --> 03:49:14,760
I don't know why I did that.

690
03:49:14,760 --> 03:49:15,940
I just...

691
03:49:15,940 --> 03:49:18,139
I threw the ball and the ball was gone.

692
03:49:18,139 --> 03:49:34,309
You look pale because this webcam is a piece of crap and it's like the most expensive webcam

693
03:49:34,309 --> 03:49:40,100
you can possibly buy and it's worse than the one I had before and it overexposes you and

694
03:49:40,100 --> 03:49:41,299
you can't do anything about it.

695
03:49:41,299 --> 03:49:43,420
It's literally the worst webcam I've ever used.

696
03:49:43,420 --> 03:50:01,250
It's a skill issue.

697
03:50:01,250 --> 03:50:02,250
There's a DSLR.

698
03:50:02,250 --> 03:50:03,250
I don't...

699
03:50:03,250 --> 03:50:04,250
I don't...

700
03:50:04,250 --> 03:50:05,250
I don't care.

701
03:50:05,250 --> 03:50:10,530
I don't want to set up a big camera pointed over here and have the room heat up even more.

702
03:50:10,530 --> 03:50:24,780
Alright, let's go.

703
03:50:24,780 --> 03:50:47,079
Bro, I'm serious.

704
03:50:47,079 --> 03:51:09,000
What is going on with my guy?

705
03:51:09,000 --> 03:51:26,530
I'll do it again.

706
03:51:26,530 --> 03:51:27,530
Don't do it again.

707
03:51:27,530 --> 03:51:54,229
I almost had it again.

708
03:51:54,229 --> 03:53:06,620
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, this guy's just spamming his down smash move and it's

709
03:53:06,620 --> 03:53:07,620
freaking me out.

710
03:53:07,620 --> 03:53:11,649
Look, and he's just doing the down move and it's freaking us both out.

711
03:53:11,649 --> 03:53:16,809
We can't do anything with him.

712
03:53:17,809 --> 03:53:21,930
He's just going shrug, he almost did it too.

713
03:53:21,930 --> 03:53:25,440
Oh my god, that was so close.

714
03:53:25,440 --> 03:53:27,639
Oh my goodness, that's a good strategy.

715
03:53:27,639 --> 03:53:29,639
That was seriously ridiculous.

716
03:53:29,639 --> 03:53:42,350
Alright, this is it, this is the end.

717
03:53:42,350 --> 03:53:48,129
Alright, we good?

718
03:53:48,129 --> 03:53:49,129
Final one.

719
03:53:49,129 --> 03:53:57,989
This is it.

720
03:53:57,989 --> 03:54:11,940
I'm going to try as hard as I can and I'm going to try to win.

721
03:54:11,940 --> 03:54:15,200
Don't throw, don't throw.

722
03:54:15,200 --> 03:54:16,520
It's asking a lot.

723
03:54:16,520 --> 03:54:19,069
You know what channel you're on.

724
03:54:19,069 --> 03:54:21,950
The channel where we do that stuff.

725
03:54:21,950 --> 03:54:27,260
Please be on Steven Universe.

726
03:54:27,260 --> 03:54:34,389
Oh, okay.

727
03:54:34,389 --> 03:54:46,270
My, I don't know what happened.

728
03:54:46,270 --> 03:54:47,270
I'm serious.

729
03:54:47,270 --> 03:54:48,989
I think I lagged out of the screen.

730
03:54:48,989 --> 03:54:49,989
I didn't press that button.

731
03:54:49,989 --> 03:54:50,989
Sorry.

732
03:54:50,989 --> 03:54:51,989
We're fine.

733
03:54:51,989 --> 03:54:52,989
We're fine.

734
03:54:52,989 --> 03:55:08,950
Fine.

735
03:55:08,950 --> 03:55:09,950
Relax.

736
03:55:09,950 --> 03:55:11,700
It's a really bad start for both of us.

737
03:55:11,700 --> 03:55:12,700
I don't know.

738
03:55:12,700 --> 03:55:26,610
I get my game fucked up.

739
03:55:26,610 --> 03:55:27,610
Oh, no.

740
03:55:27,610 --> 03:55:29,290
Oh, no.

741
03:55:29,290 --> 03:55:31,489
This was a disaster.

742
03:55:31,489 --> 03:55:32,489
This was a disaster.

743
03:55:44,329 --> 03:55:46,530
Wait, that was an absolute disaster.

744
03:55:46,530 --> 03:55:49,569
I don't even know what happened, man.

745
03:55:49,569 --> 03:55:51,569
We just, there's the same players.

746
03:55:51,569 --> 03:55:53,010
What happened?

747
03:55:53,010 --> 03:55:55,879
What even just happened?

748
03:55:55,879 --> 03:55:57,399
More like world's greatest everything.

749
03:55:57,399 --> 03:56:05,260
Alright, this is, I mean, come on, man.

750
03:56:05,260 --> 03:56:06,260
This is the final round.

751
03:56:06,260 --> 03:56:07,379
What the hell happened?

752
03:56:07,379 --> 03:56:10,040
I'm seriously shook up over this.

753
03:56:10,040 --> 03:56:11,040
Here comes the heat.

754
03:56:11,040 --> 03:56:24,370
Who I should have taken that left toy and alpha koi ki?

755
03:56:24,370 --> 03:56:26,610
I slam dunked off the screen.

756
03:56:26,610 --> 03:56:34,829
Oops.

757
03:56:34,950 --> 03:56:45,659
Okay.

758
03:56:45,659 --> 03:56:47,540
Let's go.

759
03:56:58,040 --> 03:57:00,340
I'm going as hard as I can.

760
03:57:00,340 --> 03:57:01,340
I'm going full volume.

761
03:57:01,340 --> 03:57:02,770
I'm warning you.

762
03:57:02,770 --> 03:57:13,280
I'm not going to look at chat.

763
03:57:13,280 --> 03:57:14,280
And it's Steven Universe's theme song.

764
03:57:14,280 --> 03:57:15,280
It's Steven Universe's map.

765
03:57:15,280 --> 03:57:19,840
It's the best map in the game.

766
03:59:13,379 --> 03:59:43,799
We're good.

767
03:59:43,799 --> 03:59:44,799
Good match.

768
03:59:44,799 --> 03:59:45,799
Good match.

769
03:59:45,799 --> 03:59:46,799
Good match.

770
03:59:46,799 --> 03:59:52,360
That's a good one to go out on.

771
03:59:52,360 --> 03:59:53,360
Good work.

772
03:59:53,360 --> 03:59:55,680
Oh yeah.

773
03:59:55,680 --> 03:59:57,309
No.

774
04:00:01,889 --> 04:00:03,520
Good battles.

775
04:00:03,520 --> 04:00:04,520
Good battles.

776
04:00:04,520 --> 04:00:12,600
Alright.

777
04:00:12,600 --> 04:00:18,530
That was a lot of fun.

778
04:00:18,530 --> 04:00:22,530
When you get into a rhythm, the game becomes just like fluid, you know, like water.

779
04:00:22,530 --> 04:00:26,530
It's just like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, down, boom, up, down, down, down, down.

780
04:00:29,950 --> 04:00:30,950
The game's great.

781
04:00:30,950 --> 04:00:34,510
This stream was sponsored by Warner Brothers.

782
04:00:34,510 --> 04:00:35,879
Thanks again.

783
04:00:35,879 --> 04:00:36,879

784
04:00:36,879 --> 04:00:38,049
Go check it out.

785
04:00:38,049 --> 04:00:39,049
I highly encourage you do.

786
04:00:39,049 --> 04:00:43,049
I really genuinely think this game has what it takes to be played for a long time.

787
04:00:43,049 --> 04:00:44,049
It's very fun.

788
04:00:44,049 --> 04:00:46,799
Huge thanks to Warner Brothers.

789
04:00:46,799 --> 04:00:49,809
Seriously, of course I'm going to take this sponsor.

790
04:00:49,809 --> 04:00:51,760
That was awesome.

791
04:00:51,760 --> 04:00:54,079
I will see you guys later.

792
04:00:54,079 --> 04:00:56,079
See you on Monday.

793
04:00:56,079 --> 04:00:59,670
Have a fantastic rest of your night.

794
04:00:59,670 --> 04:01:01,040
Thanks for watching.

795
04:01:01,040 --> 04:01:02,040
We'll see you for Sorcery.

796
04:01:02,040 --> 04:01:05,719
And those of you that, check out Sorcery.

797
04:01:05,719 --> 04:01:07,729
Sorcery is a really fun game.

798
04:01:07,729 --> 04:01:08,729
Really chill.

799
04:01:08,729 --> 04:01:11,610
It's kind of just like a book.

800
04:01:11,610 --> 04:01:14,389
We'll see you on Monday.

801
04:01:14,389 --> 04:01:17,799
Thanks again.

802
04:01:17,799 --> 04:01:18,799
Good night.

803
04:01:18,799 --> 04:01:20,680
Goodbye.

804
04:01:20,680 --> 04:01:22,180
Good games tonight.

805
04:01:22,180 --> 04:01:23,180
Good games tonight, right?

806
04:01:23,180 --> 04:01:25,829
Good games tonight.

807
04:01:25,829 --> 04:01:34,489
Thanks for all the subs.

808
04:01:34,489 --> 04:01:36,760
All of you.

809
04:01:36,760 --> 04:01:45,079
Now, this time I gotta remember to take this off.

810
04:01:45,079 --> 04:01:51,280
And I love Adventure Time.

811
04:01:51,280 --> 04:01:52,280
I'm just kidding around.

812
04:01:52,280 --> 04:01:53,280
I don't hate that show.

813
04:01:53,280 --> 04:01:56,000
I was kidding.

814
04:01:56,000 --> 04:01:58,000
It was a joke.

815
04:01:58,000 --> 04:01:59,000
I've seen all those episodes on TV.

816
04:01:59,000 --> 04:02:04,469
Good night, guys.

817
04:02:04,469 --> 04:02:06,479
See you soon.

818
04:02:06,479 --> 04:03:41,840
Call your mother.
