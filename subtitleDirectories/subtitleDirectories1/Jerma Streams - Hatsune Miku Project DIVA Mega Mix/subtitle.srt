1
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:09,779
Okay, how you doing? Um, so I got it open here. Oh, there's no BRB music, shit. That's my bad.

2
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:17,670
Well, there will be BRB music in a second. Not my BRB music, but whatever BRB music you're about

3
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:28,250
to hear. Um, alright, I need to change the title, don't I? Where's Daffy? Um, what should I title?

4
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:35,179
I don't know anything about Miku. What do I title the game? Because I mean, it won by a fucking

5
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:57,100
landslide, so. Keep Where's Daffy? Where's Miku? Why would Daffy Duck be in this game? I'm gonna

6
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:03,049
be honest. I'm gonna put an honest title here, I think. I've never played a Miku game in my life.

7
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:15,780
How about I've never played a Miku game in my life. The VR one, that was not a Miku game,

8
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:25,590
that was um, Space Channel 5. That wasn't a Miku game. What is the name? What's the title of this?

9
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:33,829
Hatsune Miku. Colorful Stage. Project Diva Megamix. Megamix Plus. Project Diva Future Tone DX.

10
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:43,349
Project Diva Arcade Future Tone. What game do I have? Project Diva Megamix Plus. I think that's

11
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:52,890
the one, right? Okay, I've never played a Miku game in my life. We're about to find out how this

12
00:01:52,890 --> 00:02:07,290
goes. Uh, let's, let's go for it. Should I use a controller or a mouse? I feel like controller,

13
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:33,289
probably. Is it a rhythm game? It's controller, okay. Um, I need to recapture this window. Okay,

14
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:43,740
can I put this in a, can I put this in a display full screen with frame? What does with frame mean?

15
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:50,419
Oh Jesus, that's not what I wanted to do, but whatever. Um, hold on, I need to re-add this.

16
00:02:50,419 --> 00:03:14,020
Where is it? What do you mean, looking for game to capture? It's here. It's right there.

17
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:28,629
Oh my God. Okay, there we go. All right, what is, what is it? Full screen with frame? No frame.

18
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:51,000
What's that mean? I'm just going to do 1080. That was weird. All right, let's go. We're looking,

19
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:17,029
hold on, I'm trying to move this thing. Clean your camera lens. There's nothing on it. There's

20
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:29,459
nothing on it. It's fine. There's nothing on it. Okay, time for Miku, everybody. You ready? Put it

21
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:37,319
in the dishwasher. Put, put it in the dishwasher. Okay, let's go. Is this a good enough volume? You

22
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:44,379
want me to turn it up? This is really loud for me. All right, so what do I do? What do we want

23
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:54,649
me to do? What do I do? Rhythm game? Custom gallery online store options rhythm game, right?

24
00:04:54,649 --> 00:05:16,060
So what do I, how do I play? Let the tutorial begin. Hold down the pause button. What? Wait,

25
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:23,379
what? What was that? I, I, what do I have to do? Here comes the B icon. Press the corresponding

26
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:32,519
button or key. What? Why is, what's with the left and right thing? Here comes the A icon.

27
00:05:32,519 --> 00:06:03,209
That was perfect. Shut up. Left or right? That's, left is R. That's weird. I don't like that. That's

28
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:43,620
weird. That's freaking me out. Second. Are there any lyrics? Same time.

29
00:06:48,180 --> 00:07:48,500
You know, God bless the bassist. He's got to be up there all night. Left and both right. Okay,

30
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,470
I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it.

31
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,430
When you see hold under a target, hold the button or key down to increase your score. Okay, you got

32
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:24,360
it. One, two, three, four. How long do I hold it for? As long as I want? Oh, all right.

33
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:47,480
This band, they're waiting for me to start the song and I'm just on stage like,

34
00:08:50,919 --> 00:09:04,710
yeah, who's ready? It's like, geez, fucking hurry up, man. Like, let's go. When the rainbow icon

35
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:21,830
shows up, that's your chance to spice up the music video. It's like a midi version of this song.

36
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:41,960
Quack, quack, quack. What the fuck?

37
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:09,379
This is what? Am I going to get in trouble from streaming this audio?

38
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:26,100
This is literally just like songs. What? How is this wrong? It's B. What are you talking about?

39
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:48,860
Look. It's not wrong. What's happening? What's going on? What's going on? Look,

40
00:10:49,500 --> 00:11:10,059
I don't understand what's fucking happening. It's wrong? What are you talking about? You

41
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:16,059
ignored the tutorial? No, I fucking didn't. The layout is set to the wrong controller.

42
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:41,559
What? It thinks B is A. It thinks A is B. What? I just did the tutorial with it set to the right

43
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:52,600
thing. What the fuck is it talking about? It's set to a Nintendo controller. What?

44
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:05,350
No, I don't want to customize Miku. I want to customize my fucking controller.

45
00:12:05,350 --> 00:13:05,220
It was there? Where? What is all this? Y is Y. X is X. B is A.

46
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,980
What the fuck was this all about? I literally just did the tutorial with these settings.

47
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:31,480
I don't care. Okay, left is left. Right is left. No, right is right. Oh my god, dude.

48
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:44,250
Shut up. Shut this fucking music up. I don't, what's going on?

49
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:57,850
What? Multi press up plus left. What's happening? I'm so confused right now. Multi press up and left

50
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:14,889
is Y and X. Um, huh. Unbind these. Up plus down, Y, A. This wasn't in the goddamn tutorial, dude.

51
00:14:15,769 --> 00:15:01,100
Can I leave now? I don't like that song anymore. Blackjack. Blackjack. Okay, let me see if I can

52
00:15:01,100 --> 00:16:08,659
actually play the game. Here we go. That's a pretty good hand. I think the tambourine sound is fucking

53
00:16:08,659 --> 00:16:36,700
with my head. I feel like I'm ruining the song. All this for one hand of Blackjack. There's like

54
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,580
three or four people at this table smoking cigarettes just like,

55
00:16:42,259 --> 00:17:40,700
so did you, did you bust or what? I'm sick of this. Oh, dealer had 20. You all lose.

56
00:17:42,069 --> 00:18:10,569
Try again. All right, how do I turn off the tambourine? How do I turn the tambourine off?

57
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:26,039
Button effects? Bell? Oh, okay. Woodblock? Let's try woodblock. Slide C. Wind chimes. Laser.

58
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:43,799
What's wrong? All right. Okay. All right. It's like too much stimulation. I have to get out of this.

59
00:18:44,599 --> 00:20:29,859
Cat food. Butterfly? I never heard this fucking song before in my life.

60
00:20:29,859 --> 00:21:06,150
How am I supposed to keep the rhythm if I never heard it? What the fuck?

61
00:21:06,309 --> 00:22:11,369
Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. I didn't clear it, but like, I don't know the, I don't know how the song

62
00:22:11,369 --> 00:22:16,470
goes the first time I've ever heard it. I can't sing the lyrics to something I've never heard.

63
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,789
Hey, dude, you got to keep the rhythm. You know how the song goes.

64
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:56,759
Like, I don't fuck. Oh, I've never heard it. What? Oh, thank you. Turn off the fucking tambourine.

65
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:48,200
Dude, I'm like in a front fucking row. Go Miku. All right, you're coming with us. Row it up. All

66
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,359
right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All

67
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:54,519
right. Stop. I'm going to try that again. I can't have two headphones in. I can hear this in my

68
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:59,829
sleep. One more time. One more time. All right. All right. No, turn off the... Go back to the song

69
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:10,299
list. Turn off... It's too hard. Get me out of here. No, I don't want to hear... How do I turn the song

70
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:17,980
off right now? I don't want to hear like... I just want to change the fucking button configs.

71
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:52,250
Miku, I'm such a big fan. I'm a fucking footpecker. How do I turn it off? How do I turn it off?

72
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:20,410
Options, not customization. Like that? All right, let's go. This is a bit too much for you,

73
00:25:20,410 --> 00:27:05,829
don't you think? What the fuck? Here it comes. Here comes the chorus. Next game,

74
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:13,880
80% of you said to play this. You're going to have to fucking deal with the people in the chat that

75
00:27:13,880 --> 00:28:49,460
made me play this. And by the way, it's stellar. You're almost 40. Play the banana song. First,

76
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:56,119
I need to fucking fix this. I feel like I've been stuck in a dream for the last 25 spray minutes.

77
00:28:57,079 --> 00:29:09,269
Okay. Do you... No. How do I save this fucking changes? Oh my God. Thank goodness. Here we go.

78
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:35,019
Please play the banana one. Whoa, hold on a minute. All right. All right. All right. Let's go. All

79
00:29:35,019 --> 00:30:44,519
right. That's so much better. I would go to a Miku concert. Do they serve alcohol at a Miku concert?

80
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:51,109
Like I would just get drunk and just like sit there and nod. Can you drink? Can you serve alcohol?

81
00:31:00,089 --> 00:31:13,269
They don't? I feel like I'm talking over a vacuum cleaner. It's loud for me. Hopefully it's not this

82
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:44,140
loud for you. I would be pissed off because I would definitely have like a few too many, right? And be

83
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:48,460
pissed because I can't get up and dance. So I'd be just sitting there in the corner like this, just

84
00:31:48,460 --> 00:32:58,859
like, I want to get up and dance so bad. This is a long song, isn't it? Somebody's leaning in now.

85
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:31,059
Dude, you good? You good? Yeah. Yep. Man, you get up and dance. No, no, no. No, I'm all right right here.

86
00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:38,220
I'm cool. I'm cool right here. Dude, come on. Let's go. Let's go dance. Yeah. No, just you go.

87
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:48,549
I'll be there in a minute. You go. All right. How about dermatology?

88
00:33:48,549 --> 00:34:17,880
Oh, that's cool. Do all the songs have their own kind of backgrounds? That's actually pretty cool.

89
00:34:17,880 --> 00:35:28,300
I like this. All right. You guys know, I thought Miku was a real person until like a year and a

90
00:35:28,300 --> 00:37:17,369
half ago. I thought it was a gorilla scenario. Here we go. I think I'm ready for hard. One more

91
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:59,659
time. One more time. Let's go. Important notice. Hatsune Miku. Alcohol consumption is prohibited

92
00:37:59,659 --> 00:38:16,250
both inside the live venue and the exhibition hall. All right. Well, then all right. All right.

93
00:38:16,250 --> 00:39:05,429
I don't need to. What's another good one? Let's do hard. That's a lot of songs. All right. Okay.

94
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:33,159
It's all right. Seven and a half difficulty, man. Are you serious? Oh, by the way, should I put,

95
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:44,760
this is like flashing lights in this. Should I put a warning? Probably should. I'll put a warning in.

96
00:39:44,760 --> 00:40:01,639
Title. Warning. Flashing lights. Yeah, there's like really bright flashing colors and stuff.

97
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:22,869
All right. Hold on. I wasn't ready for that. Am I ready for hard? Do you think I can do hard?

98
00:40:22,869 --> 00:40:34,059
Turn the difficulty down. Oh, shit. Too late. All right. Is this everybody's favorite song

99
00:40:34,059 --> 00:41:25,719
of the whole game? Let's go. Let's get perfect. Oh, shit. The animal just hit. The animal just hit.

100
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:37,460
Oh, my God. That was fucking impossible. Lower difficulty. Maybe a little bit lower of difficult.

101
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:45,420
No, shit. All right. Hold on. I probably do it with one eye.

102
00:44:33,769 --> 00:44:46,579
Oh, they turned it up. They like dialed it up. They turned it up. It was like,

103
00:44:49,860 --> 00:45:31,059
I wasn't ready for it. Dude, your mic sucks. I know, man. This one sounds pretty good.

104
00:45:31,059 --> 00:49:27,139
I can't fucking do those. Fuck you. Let's go. Did I win? It's really hard. It's really hard.

105
00:49:27,139 --> 00:49:47,179
What's mega mix? What's the difference? I feel like this is going to be impossible. Start music

106
00:49:47,179 --> 00:50:09,739
video. How do I do? I'm going to do the music video. All right, let's go. Oh, my eyelid. How

107
00:50:09,739 --> 00:51:21,900
do I play? I'll do my own. I'll do my own rhythm game. Get me out of here. Where's the one that

108
00:51:21,900 --> 00:52:30,730
goes... Where's that one? Holy shit. I just want to know. I'm just curious. An auctioneer.

109
00:53:18,179 --> 00:53:27,449
I'm going to do a hundred bucks. I don't know if that's what you were saying. I don't know

110
00:53:27,449 --> 00:54:00,969
what to do there. That's all of them. This is from Clayfighter. This is the Clayfighter solo.

111
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:54,309
The theme from Clayfighter. Oh, it's a good spastic controller. Settle down. No, I don't

112
00:54:54,309 --> 00:55:00,230
want to retry it. This microphone keeps breaking my sound. What does it sound like? Can I hear?

113
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:08,460
Clip that. I want to see what that sounds like. The mic blew out. Why does the mic keep blowing

114
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:15,960
out, man? I want to see what it sounds like. The edible really did hit, huh? It was right at the

115
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:42,739
end of the song too. That clip is not available anymore. Did I get fucking shut down? It sounds

116
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:56,039
so fucked up. It's like, that's so funny. It sounds like such shit. It's very sudden, loud

117
00:55:56,039 --> 00:56:04,179
movements. It just goes, no. Okay, let's keep going. That's actually kind of a good thing,

118
00:56:04,179 --> 00:56:12,860
though, because when I scream like a little shithead, it cuts it off so you can't hear it.

119
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:20,099
It protects you from hearing me sound like a little shit. Okay, let's go back to the song list.

120
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:51,210
Okay, World is Mine and Po-Pi-Po. All right, World is Mine and Po-Pi-Po. There are 178 songs.

121
00:56:51,210 --> 00:58:33,349
Po-Pi-Po? Oh, that's not it. Where's P? This one? Po-Pi-Po, Po-Pi-Po, Po-Pi-Po, Po-Pi-Po, Po-Pi-Po, Po-Pi-Po.

122
00:58:58,519 --> 00:59:23,079
Wee. Wee. I'm gonna fucking lose.

123
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:34,630
Did I win? Oh my god. All right, the next one is, what was it called? Something? I keep getting,

124
01:00:34,630 --> 01:01:09,849
I keep failing. 58%. The World is Mine, okay. World's End and Black Rock Shooter. I have to

125
01:01:09,849 --> 01:01:15,429
at least get 60% on one of these on hard. You know what it is? I'm too good for normal and not

126
01:01:15,429 --> 01:01:20,389
good enough for hard. Every rhythm game that has the button presses like this, it's always tricky for me.

127
01:01:20,389 --> 01:01:45,750
Okay.

128
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:01,239
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it.

129
01:03:19,449 --> 01:03:50,789
Hold it.

130
01:03:50,789 --> 01:04:16,699
what the fuck did i fail again 54 fucking percent man oh i'm too good for normal too bad for

131
01:04:16,699 --> 01:04:32,809
hard this should be an intermediate intermediate all right what's the name of that song that

132
