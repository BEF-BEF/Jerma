00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:21,870
Zoe looks terrible in this poster. She looks huge. She's got the same body shape. She has the same body shape as a pyro.

2
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:29,870
Alright boo, introduce this. Death tool. Hell came to earth. These four are gonna send it back.

3
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,870
That was awful.

4
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,109
Why did you say it like the demo man?

5
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:36,109
I had like eight different accents.

6
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:42,609
Let's pull this off boys.

7
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,609
Alright, I'm a boomer. I'll do what a boomer is.

8
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:52,609
You don't want to return to lobby.

9
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:55,609
Oh, like ping? Oh, ping, ping, ping.

10
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:58,170
Like who cares?

11
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,340
Oh, I don't know if this is... Well, okay.

12
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,340
Do you got to change the server?

13
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,340
But Zoe looks terrible in this poster.

14
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,340
You know what? She looks like the pyro.

15
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,650
I hate you.

16
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,650
What a stupid comment to make. Looks like the pyro. Get out of there. Get out.

17
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,650
Death tool. Hell came to earth. These four are gonna send it back.

18
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:30,650
I can't wait to play both those back to back. Like I'm gonna show the first one too.

19
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,140
You are the worst.

20
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,140
Those things are pretty horrible.

21
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,140
Oh, is it really?

22
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,140
Our things are great.

23
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:45,829
Sorry, I'll say no.

24
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:48,829
Alright, we're gonna try this one more time and that's it.

25
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:51,829
I'm sorry that they're awful.

26
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:55,349
Oh, gosh.

27
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,590
Welcome to Left 4 Dead 2.

28
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,409
You know what? I really think...

29
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,409
You know, she really looks like the pyro in this picture. Don't you guys think that?

30
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:10,409
I mean, she looks exactly like the pyro.

31
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:12,409
It's crazy.

32
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:14,409
How did the hell they get... Oh, okay.

33
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:16,409
Yeah, buddy.

34
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:18,409
Oh, what the heck.

35
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:20,409
My ping is too high.

36
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:22,409
It did kick me out.

37
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,409
Oh, it's made me be the tank.

38
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:26,409
Your ping is too high.

39
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:28,409
My ping is too high as well.

40
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:30,409
I told you.

41
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:32,409
I told you we just need to play against other people.

42
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:37,159
I was like, I was wrecking some bulls as a tank.

43
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:39,159
Dude, I got disconnected.

44
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,159
Your ping is too high.

45
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:45,719
Well, that works.

46
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,719
You know, we definitely should hang up by the docks.

47
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,719
Only because they can only really come from two real areas.

48
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,719
Like they come from straight.

49
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,719
They can't like climb. What are you doing?

50
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:55,719
I wanna go for a swim.

51
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,719
What are you doing, you idiot?

52
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,719
Well, okay, that answers that question.

53
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:01,719
The dock is not safe.

54
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,719
What did you do?

55
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:05,719
What did you do?

56
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,719
I thought he was gonna at least like grab on.

57
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,719
We will eventually have to jump down.

58
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,719
I will come to the rescue.

59
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,900
Of anyone who gets pulled off the roof.

60
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,650
Alright, let's do this thing.

61
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,650
Stay together to survive.

62
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,650
I immediately regret going on the roof.

63
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,650
There's a charger up here.

64
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,650
When can they climb?

65
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,650
Oh, I just fell. Awesome.

66
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,650
Spinner, watch out for the Spinner.

67
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,650
Oh my god, there's so many.

68
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,650
Oh, you're inside now. I'm coming for the rescue mission.

69
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,650
Good thing I didn't like edit my volume.

70
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,650
And me shooting the gun is louder than my thoughts.

71
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,650
Hobby Hamburger saved you.

72
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,650
Hamburger.

73
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,650
There's a lot of fire on the roof.

74
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,650
Yeah, I accidentally created all of them.

75
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,650
Why is the burger joint on fire?

76
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,889
Alright, try and regroup. Get back on top.

77
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:56,889
Regroup, get back on top.

78
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:58,889
Alright, is this a safe time to alt tab?

79
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:00,889
So I can talk to people?

80
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:02,889
There comes a tank.

81
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:06,889
Hunter down there too, Hunter.

82
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:08,889
Oh god, the tank does not like me at all.

83
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:10,889
Alright, sacrifice yourself and stand in the middle of the open

84
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:12,889
so we can shoot the tank.

85
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:14,889
Let me just do that right now.

86
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:16,889
Hunter on the roof.

87
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,899
Tank is jumping back down.

88
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,899
Watch yourself, Boo.

89
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,899
Where are you?

90
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:25,899
The tank is made of bricks.

91
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,899
Oh, just keep running in circles.

92
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:29,899
It's not fire.

93
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:31,899
Yeah, I have two health.

94
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:33,899
Tank down, tank down.

95
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:37,990
Charger on me.

96
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,680
Protect us.

97
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,680
I am protecting the healer.

98
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,680
Alright, let's get back.

99
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,680
Take those pills and get back on the roof.

100
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,680
Secret ladder.

101
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,500
Wish I saw that earlier.

102
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
Are we all up here?

103
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
Yeah. We are now.

104
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,759
Nice.

105
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,759
I am going to heal up.

106
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,759
Yeah, heal up. We will protect you.

107
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,759
Hey, where do we get that ammunition stuff?

108
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,759
Down there.

109
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:08,759
Yeah, ammo is downstairs I think.

110
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,759
Okay, let me just go down there.

111
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:13,259
Yeah, thanks.

112
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:15,259
So far so good, so far so good.

113
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:17,259
We are alright here.

114
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:19,259
Halfway, towards like any sort of credibility.

115
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,259
Yeah, tank down there.

116
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:23,259
Tank coming up front, tank coming up front right now.

117
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:25,689
Oh, I am getting stuck.

118
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:28,569
Oh, I am on fire now.

119
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:30,569
There is a lot of fire.

120
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:32,569
Tank is up here.

121
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:34,569
Oh, he just clubbed me.

122
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:36,569
I just fell down.

123
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,569
Uh oh.

124
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:41,509
I am down the back side.

125
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:43,509
I need ammo, I need ammo so bad.

126
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,199
Oh, my tank.

127
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,199
No, give me the ammo.

128
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:50,199
Get the hell away from me.

129
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:52,199
You bastards, you rat bastards.

130
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,199
I am getting smoked, he is on the roof.

131
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,199
Thank you, nice.

132
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:58,199
Oh, 110 shock, oh my god.

133
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,199
No.

134
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:02,199
I will not die in vain.

135
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:05,139
I tried, Jerma.

136
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:07,139
There is a tank near you.

137
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,139
I am resisting.

138
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:11,899
I am alive, I am still alive.

139
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:13,899
Oh, you are in the spit.

140
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:15,899
I am going to throw the pipe bomb.

141
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:18,649
I am still, this is unbelievable.

142
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:20,649
I can't believe I am still alive.

143
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:22,649
Oh, there is a tank on the fence right there.

144
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,649
He is right behind me.

145
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:26,649
Wait, the tank was behind me?

146
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:28,649
The tank was behind me?

147
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:30,649
Thanks, bro.

148
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:32,649
Alright, let's get on the roof and evade all the zombies.

149
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:34,649
There is a ladder around here.

150
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:36,649
Hey, you guys got 40 seconds and we got the bronze standard.

151
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:38,649
I got hit by the tank.

152
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,649
And his rocks.

153
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:42,649
It is alright.

154
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:47,269
Did we both just throw a pipe bomb at the same exact time?

155
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:49,269
Well, it is double the amount of distraction.

156
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:51,269
I think I threw a pipe bomb.

157
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:53,269
Also, there is a big mean tank.

158
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:55,269
Oh, and a charger on me.

159
00:06:55,269 --> 00:06:57,269
There is two tanks and a charger next to me.

160
00:06:57,269 --> 00:06:59,269
20 seconds, 20 seconds, you can do it.

161
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:01,269
Oh god, not towards the water.

162
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:03,269
Run in as many circles as you can.

163
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:05,269
Approximately 10 seconds of circles.

164
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:07,579
Oh god, invisible wall.

165
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:09,939
No!

166
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:11,939
5 seconds!

167
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:13,939
5 seconds!

168
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,939
At least we tried.

169
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:23,939
That's unfortunate.

170
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:25,939
I should have taken a spill or a swim.

171
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:27,939
Yeah, I should have just ran towards the water and teased him.
