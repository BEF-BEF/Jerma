Nominee for the game awards. I don't even know what's nominated

96
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,269

In the waiting room like i'm not excited at all for this. I'm not excited at all for the dentist

119
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:57,769
They are the same place to me right now

120
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:06,389
Can you imagine if like a dog waiting room had this though?

121
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,259

The matrix awakens and destiny 2

137
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,169
It's a free show one thing this community knows

138
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:50,490
It's that you don't have to hail from a giant studio to make your mark in gaming

139
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:55,129
So let's start off with our first world premiere an indie

140
00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:00,330
That is as charming as its hero is cunning. This is tunic

141
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:11,620
Excite me, let's go

142
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:20,570

00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:48,840
Kind of looks like um, all right one of those gray hairs went my eye

145
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:01,659
All right. It looks cute. All right

146
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:09,779
tunic

147
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,059
My eyes just hurt

148
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:24,500
First award of the evening and I really can't think of a better one to start us off. We want you to be games for negative

149
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:30,339
This category I don't want negative of what gaming can be i'm not gonna be negative just to be negative

150
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:35,619
Challenge the player on more than just skill exploring all the corners of the human condition

151
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:42,019
These are the games that remind us in a medium where you can be anything be good. The audio's fucked up

152
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,019

Thank you so much. Um, I can't believe we won

157
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:11,160
As devs we work on games for years at a time before we share with the world and by the time we do

158
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,119
The world's often different from when we started the adventure. I have low latency on you true for me

159
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:20,359
Than with life is strange true colors. It's not just about finishing a game in quarantine

160
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,839
Who could have predicted what kind of an impact a game about human connection would make in 2021?

161
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,680
So from everyone at deck nine and our partners at square enix. Thank you so much

It shows its true

285
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:34,140
It's an ad showcase. Yeah, it's the game awards they

286
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:37,740
The whole thing is to premiere new stuff and show ads

It's monster hunter

288
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:52,279
Monster hunter rise sunbreak. I got the one on the switch and I gave up in 30 minutes because I was sick of doing the tutorial

289
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:58,940
Like after the third hour of the one on switch I was like, I don't even want to play this anymore

290
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:14,490
I'm sure it's fun. I promise. I'm not bored. I promise

00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:46,730
Holy shit is that how much is that the 30 pounds fighting come closer and find out what's going on?

293
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:52,170
Car what the fuck was that?

294
00:33:52,569 --> 00:34:06,559
What the fuck?

295
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,559
This is insane

296
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:26,679
So what is um, it's john tucker must die. But no, no, no. No, what is it?

300
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:51,130
And now we've got the world gameplay premiere of another evil game evil west

301
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:54,730
Which we also announced that actually looked kind of cool game awards. Let's take a look

302
00:34:55,289 --> 00:35:03,469
That was that was like that was all over the place. It looked cool these years

303
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,500
maintenance

304
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,340
vigilance

305
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:14,400
Of course, all that means nothing when hell's gates start spewing shit everywhere

306
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:23,309
All right

307
00:35:23,309 --> 00:35:25,309
All right, a lot of particle effects

308
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:29,039
Again, I will make this statement again

309
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:31,880
I want less particle effects not more

310
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:36,619
And they're always neon colored

311
00:35:38,829 --> 00:35:43,389
They're always neon blue neon purple neon green

312
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:46,110
They have to be bright neon colored

313
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:51,789
It doesn't need to be bloom inside of your particle effects bloom

314
00:35:52,969 --> 00:35:55,369
I don't I hate the neon particle explosion shit

315
00:35:56,329 --> 00:36:04,510
It drives me nuts. You didn't see that coming. That was cool for more content

316
00:36:04,909 --> 00:36:07,710

00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:09,500
And now I have the pleasure of presenting the game award for best audio design

331
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:16,940
When your medium relies so heavily on being successful in putting the player inside your story audio design is everything

332
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:23,500
It's the ultimate hint system an instant mood that either alerts the player to what's coming next or obscures it

333
00:38:23,659 --> 00:38:25,260
It's basically playing god

334
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,380
Here are the nominees for best audio design. Oh wait

335
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:32,780

Oh my god

338
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:42,960
That's such a surprise to me

339
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:50,480
Our audio team throughout the development of forza horizon 5 have just been so passionate about everything that they do

340
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:56,639
There's this relentless appetite to produce an audio experience of the absolute highest quality this this award

341
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:01,519
It really does mean the world to us. That's really forza sounds great. The car is so i've just

348
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:41,159
Why are you not there with me their vision for a beautiful side? Why would I be here?

349
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:46,599
The game centers around a heartfelt relationship with a new sonic movie girl and an adorable creature

350
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:51,760
I instantly fell in love with the project and it's stunning. Don't call jim carry at 3 a.m

351
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,599
With the original soundtrack i'm working on right now. I hope he does something funny

352
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:22,719
music

353
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:28,880
I i'm this is actually really like good music somebody just said jim carrey is smoking hot and like it's kind of throwing me off

354
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:58,349
It's kind of feels like the music that are on a disneyland ride

355
00:40:58,909 --> 00:41:01,840
You guys have been on soren

356
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,360
Is it sounds like

357
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:10,960
Which is a compliment by the way, that's not negative

358
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:34,010
Sounds good

359
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:43,019
Oh, I was gonna catch it in my mouth planet of lana an off-earth odyssey

360
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:14,400
All right. All right, is he baked? Well according to my calculations

361
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:23,280
I can't believe it. We are shouldn't be hitting pretty soon final premiere of our pre-show. I gotta be careful though special game announcement

362
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:30,500
Something you did not see coming. I gotta be careful. No, i'm just kidding

363
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:51,969
Persona starting to turn into street fighters

364
00:42:52,929 --> 00:42:56,000
For like dragon ball games

365
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:00,719
Persona four

366
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,619
What was this one?

367
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:07,619
There's like two or three adjectives after the game

368
00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:12,610
persona four explosive destructive

369
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:16,599
intuition

370
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,940
Arena ultimax

371
00:43:23,409 --> 00:43:31,710
What is is that is there already one i'm so confused persona for arena ultimax is it a

372
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:35,469
It's time for me to hand it off to our main show

373
00:43:35,789 --> 00:43:39,150
It was a ps3 game. I know I know persona is like a beloved franchise

374
00:43:39,869 --> 00:43:42,269
There's a lot of like weird side things that I confuse me

375
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:49,789
An exciting artist performances by sting and imagined dragons appearances by keanu reeves

376
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:53,710
Carrie ann moss jim carrey ben schwartz and yes

377
00:43:54,349 --> 00:44:00,269
More world premieres coming up so soon for our main show and I just want to say I hope I didn't remake of a fighting game

378
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:02,510
That's cool. But you know what?

379
00:44:02,829 --> 00:44:08,670
I'm not gonna apologize because when the best of the best of game development and production has that much to share

380
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:12,989
I think we all win and when it comes to the game awards more is more, baby

381
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:19,630
Thank you all for getting stoked with me at the pre-show and congratulations to the winners of our first awards of the night

00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:53,150
Is live of course it is what am I talking about?

385
00:45:15,409 --> 00:45:17,409
It's from arcane

386
00:45:17,409 --> 00:45:24,150
These pieces I want you to hurt like you hurt me to death

387
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:33,510
I want you to lose like I lose when I play now. That's not jim carrey, please

388
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:10,340
A fallen angel you ripped out all my parts

389
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:18,190
I couldn't care for invention. You made me

390
00:46:20,429 --> 00:46:22,429
Fog the smoke

391
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,500
Some dense gas

392
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:43,519
Like I told you I feel weird just sitting here on camera just sitting doing nothing. I said this every year

393
00:47:04,139 --> 00:47:06,139
an incredibly talented person

394
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:10,590
Not this guy. He's not me

395
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:18,050
I shouldn't even be on screen right now. That was so good

396
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,230
like I

397
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:38,269
Like all this guy's probably spent like fucking hundreds of thousands of hours crafting the ability to build play like this

398
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:40,190
on stage

399
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,190
At the peak of his musical talent

400
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,679
Wait, is resident evil 9 gonna get announced today?

401
00:47:48,559 --> 00:48:14,880
I don't belong here right now. That was unbelievable. Actually. It was really really good. That was really good

402
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:31,780
Why don't we just go ahead and tell her that we're divorcing is not pick him away

403
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:36,179
Of the free-thinking world is in your hands

404
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:41,699
It's a resident. I know you've been meeting with her behind my back. I loved resident evil 8. I know people didn't like it

405
00:48:46,539 --> 00:48:52,500
And I sense suffering here spirit

406
00:48:54,980 --> 00:49:04,420
You have to work on it just give up we're never getting out of here. Let's see how special you are

407
00:49:05,539 --> 00:49:07,900
Have been doomed to a great game

408
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:20,719
It will not be fine. It will be

409
00:49:24,059 --> 00:49:29,949
I guess it's my time to shine. You gave it a six

410
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:35,570
I did

411
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:43,730
No, I didn't look into your eye that really I did. Sorry. No way

412
00:49:44,449 --> 00:49:46,849
That's embarrassing because i'm talking about how much I loved it

413
00:49:47,570 --> 00:50:03,860
Stay a team. Enjoy the beach solution was enough

414
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:13,119
I'm breaking this loop

415
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:15,199
Welcome to the game awards

416
00:50:15,659 --> 00:50:18,320

00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,619
He's like pulled muscle in my chest. I'm serious

419
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:39,840
We're here all the stupid things to that apparently game awards video games biggest night live in person

420
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:44,719
Look at all that. That's a lot

421
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:52,050
Holy shit, that's really decorated sting phenomenal. So honored to have him open our show

422
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:56,849
That was what could have been from arcane the new netflix series based on league of legends

423
00:50:57,090 --> 00:51:01,889
Thank you so much sting ray chen and the game show was supposed to be really good, isn't it conducted by lauren

424
00:51:01,889 --> 00:51:04,449
I've seen the first two episodes absolutely incredible. Thank you guys

425
00:51:05,889 --> 00:51:12,309
Well, I gotta say it feels so incredible to be back here on stage at microsoft theater

426
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:16,389
And streaming live to tens of millions of you around the world

427
00:51:16,789 --> 00:51:21,349
This is a night for the fans and you know, the games we love

428
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:29,030
Are nothing without amazing developers and that's why we do this show to honor the creators of games

429
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:34,710
So welcome to all of you. I didn't read the harry potter books either and I watched the movies. I'm not gonna play league ever

430
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:38,420
So good to see everyone

431
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:46,019
But you know, we gotta be real and we can't ignore the headlines that are out there game creators need to be supported by the companies

432
00:51:46,099 --> 00:51:51,039
That employ them. I think we all agree with that

433
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,880
So let me just say this before we get to any of the news or announcements or awards

434
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,320
We should not and will not tolerate any abuse

435
00:51:59,719 --> 00:52:04,860
Harassment and predatory practices by anyone including our online communities

436
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:16,420
We all love games and if we want this industry to keep growing we must build an even brighter and more inclusive future

437
00:52:17,539 --> 00:52:19,539
The games we play

438
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:25,139
And when the games that we love they teach us that we can impact the world around us and tonight

439
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:30,980
I call on everyone to do their part to build a better safer video game industry

440
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:33,380

00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:09,360
Wait, really?

449
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,360
Oh shit, that's awesome

450
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:17,010
I love this guy

451
00:53:17,389 --> 00:53:24,309
Independence allows a game to go a little bit more wild become a bit stranger and the freedom to break boundaries

452
00:53:28,769 --> 00:53:35,489
Demonstrate excellence achieved through great risk here are the nominees for best independent game

453

All right, people are gonna people are gonna eat each other over this one

454
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:43,570
Look, I know this sounds weird, but didn't play it. He's repeating itself

455
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:50,710
Didn't play it

456
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:55,619
Didn't play it

457
00:53:55,619 --> 00:54:00,789
Didn't play it

458
00:54:00,789 --> 00:54:02,920
Didn't play it

459
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,239
Fuck. I'm what am I even doing here?

460
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:08,960
Why am I here?

461
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:15,360
I shouldn't be live for best independent game. Her inscription was very good. I've always been scripted if it was me

462
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,079
kena bridge of spirit

463
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:23,679
I actually did not play any of these games

464
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:28,449
All right

465
00:54:28,449 --> 00:54:31,090
If I mean this and I mean it I mean it

466
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:33,889
I mean it

467
00:54:33,889 --> 00:54:39,090
If I have not played at least three games that are nominated throughout this entire broadcast

468
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:41,650
I will gift a hundred community subs

469
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:45,329
Like come on, dude. Are you serious?

470
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:52,179
I have to have played at least three of these. Um, well, yeah, but it was an amazing journey to get here

471
00:54:52,659 --> 00:54:56,500
Um took a lot of heart with an awesome team a few of them are here today

472
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:02,639
But just can't say enough about the amazing people we worked with on to make this game and to make the vision come true

473
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:07,360
Um have to take our partners at sony who kind of believed in us from the very beginning

474
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:11,840
I don't think I played one three and all the guys at epic who just have been there from the beginning. So

475
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,960
Thank you everyone. And uh, this is a great honor. Oh, I said a hundred subs not add anything to the debt

476
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:26,690
You said you played one. I know I played resident evil 8

477
00:55:27,329 --> 00:55:30,530
Congratulations guys. All right. Now it's time to look into the future

478
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:34,769
Two years ago this team announced their game on this very stage now

479
00:55:34,849 --> 00:55:38,130
They're back with the first gameplay reveal when I saw this

480
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:44,130
I could not believe it was actual gameplay, but it is captured by the team in game this past weekend

481
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:50,130
So back and get ready. Is it though experience a new level of cinematic immersion?

482
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:58,070
Okay, we'll see

483
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:02,050
She said our swords

484
00:56:02,769 --> 00:56:07,409
We will forge new stories to strike the gods that haunt us

485
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,659
All right

486
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:31,250
Oh, it's this game with the real faces when they were still singing and it was like a real face

487
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:52,019
Soothe our scars of their siege of our may see them as gods

488
00:56:52,739 --> 00:56:57,320
We will show you eyes behind their eyes

489
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:13,159
Uncanny valley maxed out

490
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,969
What is that

491
00:57:39,969 --> 00:57:45,119
What was that?

492

Do you fight this shit? I didn't play the first one

493
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,280
Did I just skip the book and go right to the movie when this comes out?

494
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:31,170

509
01:02:03,269 --> 01:02:09,829

510
01:02:09,909 --> 01:02:13,190
Just keeps getting better. Thanks to ninja theory for that incredible. Oh man

511
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:19,269
It was gameplay in the sense of it's the gameplay engine not like a full motion video rendered cutscene

512
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,550
Right

513
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:29,940
That's like a rendered. That's not that's a non rendered full motion cutscene. That's still impressive though. It looks great

514
01:02:30,579 --> 01:02:34,400
Am I gonna play it? Not really

01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:21,679
One with the joystick in the arcades

539
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:33,719
It was like you control the tie fighter and then you fight darth vader it was like a big arcade cabinet reference to be inspired

540
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:39,480
To build up all this drag this insane costume all this makeup all this hair, but feel powerful

541
01:06:40,199 --> 01:06:42,780
Because as a kid, I felt weak. I felt like the outsider

613
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:01,380
Wrestling empire is not nominated

614
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:04,899
Oh shit, that actually might be my favorite game of the year. You're right

615
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:13,720
real face game

616
01:16:22,279 --> 01:16:26,760
All right, it's here's the new trend in gaming the we have a real face

617
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:34,520
Sam lake sam they come all the way over for finland for this. This is so exciting

618
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:37,960
Alan wake too. It's been a decade fans have been asking you for it

619
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:43,159
Why is now the right time to bring him back? Well, first of all, didn't alan wake get removed from steam?

620
01:16:43,479 --> 01:16:46,199
It's been raining here in los angeles today

621
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:51,720
It's on us like fiction fiction leaking out into reality. So, sorry

622
01:16:52,279 --> 01:16:55,560
Didn't get removed from steam because they had like copywritten music in it or something over 10 years

623
01:16:55,960 --> 01:17:03,239
Uh make this streaming of making it we've been iterating on the concept and we know fans have been asking for it

624
01:17:03,399 --> 01:17:07,819
We've been a bit protective. We knew this is gonna be a pretty scary experience

625
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:13,079
That game was all over that was a cool game that was even with a flashlight, right?

626
01:17:13,079 --> 01:17:16,600
What kind of game are we gonna get for the sequel? Can you tell us something about it?

627
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:22,119
Yeah, we are breaking new ground here. This is going to be remedy's first ever

628
01:17:22,659 --> 01:17:24,659
survival horror game

629
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:30,840
Our take on the genre the first game had horror elements to it, but it was an action game

630
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:35,560
I'm actually more interested in this than I was before the perfect genre to bring together

631
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:40,840
The story and gameplay closer than ever before because the story horror story

632
01:17:41,319 --> 01:17:46,760
Is at the very heart of this and it's psychological layered deep mystery to dive into

633
01:17:47,159 --> 01:17:52,039
I you know, you are actually pretty that's incredible. I'm interested. I can't wait to see what you're doing with this game

634
01:17:52,039 --> 01:17:53,000

Like the real trailer

655
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:39,800
This is a blank dvd for effect if this was the real trailer

656
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:43,800
I feel like we were screwed because there's no computer with a dvd drive anymore

657
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:49,720
So this would be like troublesome. I've got a 40 blood vitamin d level. We all are about sonic 2 so many

667
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:36,140
Where we can really get to know each other

668
01:20:36,699 --> 01:20:39,659
Hey before you see this exciting new son, he's smoking hot

669
01:20:39,739 --> 01:20:45,180
I'd like to pass on a word of advice that my scottish grandfather gave to me when I was just a boy. He said son

670
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:48,699
Don't grade it in the grinder

671
01:20:49,819 --> 01:20:51,829
Don't do it son

672
01:20:51,829 --> 01:20:53,989
Don't grade it and the grinder boy

673
01:20:55,189 --> 01:20:58,869
Graded trek five confirmed grade it till the cows come home

674
01:20:59,590 --> 01:21:02,069
But don't grade it and the grinder

675
01:21:02,949 --> 01:21:07,510
And then to drive the point home he put his hands around my neck and he squeezed real hard and he said

676
01:21:07,989 --> 01:21:09,989
Don't do it son

677
01:21:10,069 --> 01:21:15,029
Don't grade it and the grinder are you listening to me boy?

678

But you don't choose that moment that moment chooses you I just got goosebumps. Wait a second. Did you steal that from oprah?

689
01:22:32,119 --> 01:22:37,880

702
01:24:18,619 --> 01:24:22,090
They're gonna set up for this one

703
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:24,090
What was the game? What was the game? What was it? What was the game?

704
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:31,000
Remember you talked through all the other trailers died. You don't I don't talk through jim carrey. No matter what

705
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:34,569
That's like talking at church. Are you shitting me?

706
01:24:38,539 --> 01:25:06,180
Constant conflict. Yeah, it is

707
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:12,340
Oh, that's that's chugging

708
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:15,350
That's chugging. It's chugging

709
01:25:24,819 --> 01:25:26,579
Wow, that actually looks cool

710
01:25:26,579 --> 01:25:35,369
That last 10 seconds made me want this game. That looked really cool

711
01:25:36,010 --> 01:25:51,420
The gameplay was lagging

712
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:52,939
It's early

713
01:25:52,939 --> 01:25:54,939
It's early relax

714
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:01,060
I thought that was her making those sounds

715
01:26:01,779 --> 01:26:09,020
I thought she was going like

716
01:26:09,020 --> 01:26:11,020
I was like, holy shit. Who is this?

717
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:30,119
There's one thing I wish I could do it was play a musical instrument, but I got these fingers

718
01:26:31,159 --> 01:26:34,500
It don't they don't work. I can't

719
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:39,720
I got this which never closes and never ceases

720
01:26:40,439 --> 01:26:42,760
This works just fine. These not so much

721
01:26:43,479 --> 01:27:06,300
It's actually not much of an issue. You just need practice

722
01:27:07,819 --> 01:27:09,819
I hold a pencil like this

723
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:14,420
I don't think practice is going to help me

724
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:19,720

01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:57,079
Begin surrender to the darkness embrace it

737
01:28:59,319 --> 01:29:11,619

01:29:20,079 --> 01:29:22,960
So when is the second there's a second part coming out, right?

01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:33,819
2021 game awards xbox game pass for pc and youtube

741
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:39,180
What do we think? You know, it's so effortful. I like that. We animate it. You're welcome

742
01:29:39,420 --> 01:29:41,899
Okay, I understand the impulse to do something big

743
01:29:42,699 --> 01:29:45,579
But what do pc gamers actually want?

744
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:51,500
Because I don't think it's that video graphics cards new pc games. We have some great ones coming day one

745
01:29:51,659 --> 01:29:54,539
That aren't 400 marked up marketing idea

746
01:29:54,539 --> 01:29:58,539
What if gator tweets out this list more or less leaking it in a cool hip way

747
01:29:58,779 --> 01:30:03,100
I retweet it because I have so many more followers in here. It's done. What's done? Tweet it. It's out there

748
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:05,979
No, you didn't I don't think you should have proactivity and a crime, man

749
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:12,939
When people think about xbox game pass they think about console. They don't know we're a pc gaming service. Why not just call it

750
01:30:13,579 --> 01:30:15,420
pc game pass

751
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:18,380
That's a great idea. Okay, we're going with that

752
01:30:18,779 --> 01:30:23,739
Just like that, you're gonna change the name of the whole thing because of gator who calls himself gator

753
01:30:24,140 --> 01:30:30,619
It's a good name. All we gotta do is ask some top tier streamers to this to really land gator. Yes, what about

754
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:33,180

We'll take it from here brother. We got cameos. We got ideas percolating right next steps to me

757
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:45,260
Like what about jerva?

758
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:50,460
I said it. Are we really gonna make I said it for the game awards and you're not gonna wrap in it at all

759
01:30:51,340 --> 01:30:52,539
That meeting

760
01:30:52,539 --> 01:30:53,739
fucking

761
01:30:53,739 --> 01:30:56,060
Get away with that graphics cards need to be cheaper

762
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:05,180
And I get thrown out this is kind of like saying we're at the the game awards

763
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:08,140
Yeah, yeah

764
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:33,949
I just didn't mean to put the webcam on why is the stream in 480? It's not I swear to god. It's 1080

765
01:31:45,359 --> 01:31:46,720
Handy crush

01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:54,060
For a second. I thought that was a new mario was like they're gonna just really just announce a new mario like that

767
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:56,140
That's the golf one that I promised

768
01:31:56,220 --> 01:32:04,029
It's 864p. Yeah, but the stream i'm pulling is 1080

769
01:32:04,670 --> 01:32:09,239
Slime rancher 2 is on day one release for the pc game pass

770
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:15,000
Are you lying to me right now or is do you mean that hello game words?

771
01:32:15,079 --> 01:32:18,359
My name is martin fos anderson aka mr savage is really bad

772
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:22,279
If you're if you're stressed what I do for you're trying to play a game and trying to win it

773
01:32:22,439 --> 01:32:28,840
If I was stressed after school, I just wouldn't be able to focus properly and it would just make everything 10 times harder

774
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:34,359
Together with truth. I have an important message vaping nicotine can increase anxiety symptoms and stress levels

775
01:32:34,439 --> 01:32:37,420
I think it's really important people know the truth about vaping nicotine

776
01:32:41,180 --> 01:32:43,180
Yeah, don't fake what are you doing?

777
01:32:50,170 --> 01:32:52,729
Smoke is bad. Yeah, I what are you doing?

778
01:32:53,449 --> 01:32:54,569
I don't know

779
01:32:54,569 --> 01:33:11,789
Did I tell you guys about the stream that I wanted to do?

780
01:33:13,199 --> 01:33:19,680
Where I was kind of just put on like sunglasses and get in and get in front of the webcam and play fortnight

781
01:33:21,359 --> 01:33:23,289
And just be vaping

782
01:33:23,289 --> 01:33:28,569
and the whole time the webcam would get filled with smoke like it would be you couldn't even see me and the smoker line was

783
01:33:28,569 --> 01:33:29,850
gonna go off

784
01:33:29,850 --> 01:33:35,369
And like a fire like firefighters were gonna come like break the wall behind me and I was gonna still just be playing fortnight

785
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:50,199
Sorry, um, I'm I'm I just didn't do it present the game award for best action, I guess

786
01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:53,710

787
01:33:55,359 --> 01:33:57,359
Sorry, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry

788
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:02,960

01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:05,760

790
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000

What are you watching? Sorry. Sorry. Um, where was I the prompter right?

792
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:18,720
What's supposed to be watching action is the best when it's kinetic and and fast paced and

793
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:23,600
And and totally organic to the uh, no you did not master chief

794

I'm i'm on stage presenting the game award for best action while watching streamers on twitch

798
01:34:48,430 --> 01:34:50,430
Seemed like a pretty reasonable compromise

799
01:34:51,789 --> 01:34:54,989
Anyway, here are the nominees name drop me name drop me. Let's see it

800
01:34:56,859 --> 01:34:58,859

That shouldn't be on here. Sorry. Sorry

Was it good? I mean just literally just one best action game should be good

826
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:03,640

01:37:04,199 --> 01:37:06,680
Action shooter. Oh shit. Should I try it?

828
01:37:07,239 --> 01:37:12,079
That actually kind of looks cool

829
01:37:12,079 --> 01:37:17,529
Should I play it?

830
01:37:17,529 --> 01:37:23,550
Really good. It can't be all right. Maybe i'll give it a look at the beginning

831
01:37:23,949 --> 01:37:29,710
We landed on mark only on ps5 looked wrong. Oh, okay

832
01:37:32,279 --> 01:37:40,279

Yeah, we wanted to find her good luck. I know

834
01:37:48,010 --> 01:37:51,340
But she was baiting us

835
01:37:52,810 --> 01:37:56,890
Look, can I just like come over your house and just like smell the exhaust of your ps5?

836
01:37:57,689 --> 01:38:01,960

Nothing just said no

841
01:38:23,319 --> 01:38:35,560
And I just put my hand at the back of the exhaust and feel the heat feel the air

842
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:38,520
Let's go. Oh, dude. It's like it's hot

No, dude, you can't touch anything in my house

844
01:39:09,420 --> 01:39:23,159

01:39:39,229 --> 01:39:44,510
No, it's been some pretty cool reveals actually from the uh, the first mission of the game, which is so cool

848
01:39:44,590 --> 01:39:47,149
And bungee is celebrating their 30th anniversary this year

01:39:58,029 --> 01:40:01,710
Uh a few months ago a japanese game creator reached out to me and said hey

01:40:02,029 --> 01:40:07,869
I want to announce my next game at the game awards and i'm so honored to have this opportunity to present this

Slither head

858
01:41:55,560 --> 01:42:00,600
That's a fun one. It's clear tori Amazon has not abandoned his roots. Uh, thank you again for that very special announcement

01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:10,640
Comprised of many industry veterans check this out. That looked really actiony though

861
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:15,119
That did not look like a typical runaway and hide kind of game that looked like you were fighting stuff with swords

862
01:42:29,630 --> 01:42:40,729
Wish list them I think I don't think they were available. Oh put the human face on the top

863
01:42:47,789 --> 01:42:54,649
Stranding us in these realms we have searched for a way lost

864
01:42:55,390 --> 01:42:57,789
What about the his the dangerous falls?

865
01:42:58,989 --> 01:43:04,109
You are never gonna get like a huge monster like that with just a huge swinging nutsack. It's never gonna happen

866
01:43:04,829 --> 01:43:06,189
just stop

867
01:43:06,189 --> 01:43:09,069
People of the goal. Where's the book like it's not gonna happen

868
01:43:11,369 --> 01:43:14,159
and the crazy part is

869
01:43:14,159 --> 01:43:18,520
It would be every portal is it's not gonna happen. Stop saying it

870
01:43:20,189 --> 01:43:25,279
Half-life one had it

871
01:43:25,279 --> 01:43:27,779
Like these 500 foot dinosaurs

872
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:42,239

01:43:42,239 --> 01:43:44,399

876
01:43:58,619 --> 01:44:03,739
How inappropriate and stupid that would be like no why

877
01:44:08,220 --> 01:44:10,220
I would not want to play that game

878
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:30,920

01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:35,149
Admit it you'd love to play that

880
01:44:36,029 --> 01:44:38,350
It would be really strange. It would be like wow

881
01:44:39,069 --> 01:44:41,069
They do it just things

I hate me right now and I love it. My focus is primarily joy a vats target

904
01:46:15,079 --> 01:46:19,399
Has the potential to be cynical about everything this game sucks

905
01:46:19,479 --> 01:46:23,399
I hate it and I hate everything what's going on. It's much more enjoyable. What's happening?

906
01:46:24,119 --> 01:46:27,960
A lot of that started when I was in the military finding out that people shot rockets at your plane

907
01:46:28,439 --> 01:46:31,399
It's a reminder that nothing is promised. Do you want to look back on your life?

908
01:46:31,399 --> 01:46:34,439
I thought I was doing that looks on the good because I have the gox lr

I'm sorry, but that first swing hits the desk or the top of a chair or vase

914
01:47:04,329 --> 01:47:08,170
I don't like this what I would call propaganda from the vr industry

915
01:47:08,729 --> 01:47:11,369
With like oh just put the headset on and fucking just go

916
01:47:12,649 --> 01:47:17,369
No, no, no, no, no. No, you have to clear out your entire room. You gotta like take your trash out

917
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:22,000
You've got to make sure that there's nothing there. It's an empty room or you're gonna get hurt

918
01:47:24,220 --> 01:47:26,619
There's no way you put on goggles and just go for it

919
01:47:26,619 --> 01:47:29,500
Like oh just push the chair over four or five inches. No, excuse me

920
01:47:29,899 --> 01:47:50,539
What is this?

921
01:47:50,539 --> 01:47:55,500
Like if that shit happens if you did what that person did you're gonna you're literally gonna karate chop through your desk like

922
01:47:55,739 --> 01:47:57,739
Wwf style you're gonna go through the table

923
01:47:58,699 --> 01:48:06,829

01:48:58,199 --> 01:49:00,439
Half-life alex is worth a thousand dollars. Okay

We all made that joke 10 years ago. I would pay a thousand dollars for half-life free

945
01:50:16,770 --> 01:50:28,420
I'll see you soon back in the summer of 2019. I visited this shit first time developer at his studio in the united kingdom

946
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:32,500
He told me his dream was to one day share his game with the world at the game awards

947
01:50:32,579 --> 01:50:35,060
Well, that dream is about to come true. It's free

948
01:50:36,659 --> 01:50:40,539
Kind of late for that. Don't you think like I feel like that should have been like three or four years ago

949
01:50:44,699 --> 01:50:55,069
Well, but most of the battlegrounds games kind of falling off a little bit

950
01:50:55,069 --> 01:50:58,109
Yeah, I mean like fortnight's obviously huge and it will be probably forever

951

They like they went to like an old tweet and they like ratioed me

956
01:51:22,619 --> 01:51:24,800
I was trying to figure out what the fuck was happening

01:51:25,699 --> 01:51:26,739
I got like a notification

958
01:51:26,739 --> 01:51:29,220
I was like because I check my twitter like once a week or something, right?

959
01:51:29,300 --> 01:51:35,619
I'm just scrolling down and I see a tweet that I had like four likes on this tweet from like five years ago

960
01:51:36,819 --> 01:51:40,340
And the person wrote like oh i've ratioed you about the fucker or something

I was like what and they had like more likes than I did

962
01:51:43,619 --> 01:51:51,789
But it's just like that tweet's like seven years old

963
01:51:54,430 --> 01:51:56,430

999
01:57:10,460 --> 01:57:12,939
I'm gonna hold judgment because they make them do weird shit

1000
01:57:13,100 --> 01:57:17,819
I wouldn't be surprised if you got a lab coat and was making potions and shit in like an underground mad scientist laboratory

1001
01:57:18,619 --> 01:57:22,060
Sonic and the mad science laboratory. Just make it a sonic game. Come on, please

1002
01:57:39,869 --> 01:57:41,630
not a frontiers

1003
01:57:41,630 --> 01:57:58,130
Stop making up scenarios to get outraged at

1004
01:58:01,729 --> 01:58:03,729
That's the point of a straw man

1005
01:58:04,770 --> 01:58:07,569
I build his ass up so I can knock his ass down

1006
01:58:10,939 --> 01:58:12,939
Uh

1007
01:58:20,829 --> 01:58:28,350
What I got a little job for you, it's just temporary folks here they don't make no never mind who you are

1008
01:58:29,149 --> 01:58:31,979
What you done?

1009
01:58:31,979 --> 01:58:33,979
Everything's got to be new these days

1010
01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:36,920
sensational

1011
01:58:37,890 --> 01:58:44,050
Whoa, let the mirrors show you who you are. What's your pitch pal? You want to level?

1012
01:58:44,689 --> 01:58:46,689
I'd love to learn anything that you want to teach me

1013
01:58:47,729 --> 01:58:55,409
I can read a mark quick. This is an fmv game. Holy shit, please pay good money just to make himself feel better

1014
01:58:56,930 --> 01:59:02,689
Heaves his own lives

1015
01:59:02,850 --> 01:59:12,369
Don't get hurt and you lie you try to find your way out. I warned you didn't I?

1016
01:59:13,329 --> 01:59:16,909
There is no way out

1017
01:59:19,380 --> 01:59:21,380
Oh, it's not okay. Never mind

1018
01:59:21,779 --> 01:59:24,899
They're already we already knew about this that was the best way i've seen since

1019
01:59:25,460 --> 01:59:32,020
That's trending now on to awards business. I am honored to be announcing the best art direction category

1020
01:59:32,500 --> 01:59:39,859
These nominees across a broad variety of budgets and genres each found their own path. No gameplay. Nobody visual design

1021
01:59:40,340 --> 01:59:42,100
music and animation

1022
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:45,939
Into their own distinct expression of intent and purpose

1023
01:59:46,739 --> 01:59:50,500
Uh, you know one franchise, I love the art that looks good though. That looks actually really good

1024
01:59:50,659 --> 01:59:52,659
I hope we get a new one of those

1025
01:59:52,899 --> 01:59:56,529
Anyhow, here are the nominees for best art direction

1026
01:59:58,289 --> 02:00:00,720
I'm just looking for one more

1027
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:30,939
That's just been nominated like four or five times. This is good. I didn't play any of those and the game award for best

1028
02:00:31,260 --> 02:00:35,779
Our direction goes to sargonas two. I would be fired a guess death loop

1029
02:00:38,180 --> 02:00:40,579
Wait, this is the game that you rewind time and like go fight

1030
02:00:41,220 --> 02:00:44,659
Yourself and other people like kill each other going relinding and shit

1031
02:00:45,380 --> 02:00:58,300
I should play this

1032
02:00:59,260 --> 02:01:03,340
Because last night I made the bet that gear model toro would be giving this award so

1033
02:01:04,619 --> 02:01:06,619
I can't give an opinion

1034
02:01:07,260 --> 02:01:12,619
I would stick to my to my everybody's looking for like a like a hot take here. I didn't I didn't play this

Also, thank you for rewarding or risk talking or patient for visual

And our attention to details. That's a our players seem to really appreciate isn't it?

1040
02:01:42,140 --> 02:01:47,739
Tonight i'm proud ladies and gentlemen, and I think the guys across the the ocean at arken are really proud too

1041
02:01:48,539 --> 02:01:50,779
Thanks to them for this fucking what a psycho nuts

1044
02:02:03,819 --> 02:02:09,739
A big hug for our families and friends. And lastly, I'd like to dedicate this award to the boss robert altman

I'm genuinely angry. Damn. Really?

1047
02:02:24,460 --> 02:02:29,180
What did I say? I was like, I can't give you I'm basically like a guy that just got picked up from like the subway

And the game award goes to

1065
02:03:57,810 --> 02:03:59,810
It takes two

That's three

1069
02:04:20,859 --> 02:04:25,579
I am never gonna get nominated. I'm never gonna win a single award presented by verizon

1070
02:04:25,979 --> 02:04:31,659
There I talk about how like I might show my dick on stream. No one's going to nominate me for anything

1071
02:04:31,979 --> 02:04:34,460
It's never gonna happen. Why are you waiting for it?

1072
02:04:35,579 --> 02:04:37,840
It's not gonna happen

1073
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:39,840
Yo, don't be waiting for that

1074
02:04:40,579 --> 02:04:44,560
What's good? This is kyleef adams here in full effect rocking

02:04:45,100 --> 02:04:49,659
This one we podcast the premier podcast spotlighting people of color in the video game industry

1076
02:04:49,659 --> 02:04:53,659
Look at me. Look at me now. I when you have i'm not gonna get nominated for anything

1077
02:04:54,220 --> 02:05:00,909
Culture and within the world where you see something that grows you dick of the year

1078
02:05:02,109 --> 02:05:05,869
Wrong award show confused you feel upset you feel hurt

1079
02:05:06,430 --> 02:05:09,069
There's a different thing that I can do it's a different one

1080
02:05:10,029 --> 02:05:15,979
The things right now are very other things are all over the place in lots of different ways. It's scary, man

1081
02:05:16,140 --> 02:05:18,779
I mean, it's that's just there's no other way to put it

1082
02:05:18,859 --> 02:05:21,500
It is scary to be black in this country today

1083
02:05:21,659 --> 02:05:22,779
I'm a black mom

1084
02:05:22,779 --> 02:05:26,619
So i'm scared a lot of people in gaming communities just don't want to hear it

1085
02:05:27,020 --> 02:05:32,300
We sat down for about two hours or so just kind of ran through our feelings and emotions because it's all

1086
02:05:32,619 --> 02:05:34,220
I don't want to bring politics

1087
02:05:34,300 --> 02:05:38,939
Well, i'm glad that you can ignore this shit because it's quote unquote politics when there's a lot of people reality

1088
02:05:39,020 --> 02:05:43,979
So the show goes up it launches so i would see i'm happy to be your streamer of the year

1089
02:05:44,060 --> 02:05:46,779
Hey, you need to check this out. Hey, you need to be paying attention to this

1090
02:05:47,340 --> 02:05:51,100
And then one of the big outlets caught it and then it just moved

1091
02:05:51,659 --> 02:05:53,659
Let's just speak the 100 true

1092
02:05:53,739 --> 02:05:56,699
You know, I'd always wanted to use my voice in a way that felt powerful

1093
02:05:57,180 --> 02:06:01,180
Really bring home the conversation about doing a show through a prism of blackness

1094
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:05,979
I think we did the job in a really good way and I think the world and the industry was better for it

1095
02:06:09,619 --> 02:06:17,300
When he said ego, what do you say? Oh, I want to read this

1096
02:06:18,340 --> 02:06:20,340
Ego andy, what did it say?

1097
02:06:20,979 --> 02:06:36,670
That ego andy is trying to to cope with him not winning an award. I don't I really don't care. I don't

1098
02:06:40,430 --> 02:06:47,550
I've really just I trust me. It's pubg again

1099
02:06:48,189 --> 02:06:51,890
Doesn't care. I don't

1100
02:06:51,890 --> 02:07:00,270
I think I need some kind of reward

1101
02:07:00,590 --> 02:07:09,020
I think I need some kind of reward to prove that I

1102
02:07:09,739 --> 02:07:17,680
Really like just wanted one

1103
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:29,119
With amazon luna, I can play all my favorite games straight from the cloud. That's right

1104
02:07:29,359 --> 02:07:32,000
I can play on my fire tv tablet and phone

1105
02:07:33,439 --> 02:07:35,439
I thought I did a good job

1106
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:44,640
I thought I did a good job this year

1107
02:07:57,439 --> 02:08:03,039
You got a bunch of people are spamming loser loser cry loser

1108
02:08:07,020 --> 02:08:13,760
If you just came into the stream, you'd be like, holy shit. What the fuck these people are assholes. These people are total pricks

1109
02:08:29,869 --> 02:08:31,869
And now i'm wet

1110
02:08:33,869 --> 02:08:35,869
Hope when hope is lost

1111
02:08:41,180 --> 02:08:42,859
All right, I kind of

1112
02:08:42,859 --> 02:08:45,489
I kind of want to go get a shitload of water and dump it in my eyes

1113
02:08:45,729 --> 02:08:48,609
And go fall screen and be crying that I didn't win content creator of the year

1114
02:08:48,770 --> 02:08:50,770
Will you guys play along with that for a little while?

1115
02:09:08,539 --> 02:09:11,899
Just like boogers like flowing out of my nose

1116
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:19,520
Why would anybody stream them doing that

1117
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:37,020
That's right

1118
02:09:37,020 --> 02:09:42,140
Now there's a shitload of other content creators guys that are doing all kinds of cool shit. So don't worry

1119
02:09:51,569 --> 02:09:53,729
Although I would have liked to have seen ludwig on that list

1120
02:09:55,789 --> 02:10:01,470
She's an actor who stars in the mandalorian and the upcoming series the book of boba fett

1121
02:10:02,029 --> 02:10:04,029
Please welcome ming na wen

1122
02:10:15,170 --> 02:10:21,649
Also, some of the vtubers have just exploded in growth and popularity. There's there's so many good creators

1123
02:10:21,649 --> 02:10:27,659
Our own involvement with the story and its characters to be nominated best narrative award

1124
02:10:28,060 --> 02:10:32,539
A great game demands provocative dialogue and a captivating plot

1125
02:10:32,939 --> 02:10:38,380
But above all it must exhibit a meaningful involvement with the audience

1126
02:10:39,359 --> 02:10:43,439
And also just speaking as the mother of a son who loves gaming

1127
02:10:44,500 --> 02:10:47,460
It's nice when there's more to the story than just blowing up

1128
02:10:47,859 --> 02:10:54,180
Grenade factories and shouting obscenities at your alligator brides, what if you won worst creator?

1129
02:10:54,260 --> 02:10:59,300
That would be actually really funny the nominees for best narrative then like then like the crying on camera

1130
02:10:59,300 --> 02:11:02,500
Like I I did a good job this year. Oh, that'd be funny

1131
02:11:03,939 --> 02:11:09,859
Piecing together the puzzle it was a spell. I am telling you if it is a spell

1132
02:11:10,420 --> 02:11:15,619
How do we break it? I need to find out exactly what happened that night. I can reveal their secrets

1133
02:11:16,500 --> 02:11:21,220
You know, I would really like them to do more than one content creator category

1134
02:11:22,500 --> 02:11:24,180
streaming youtube

1135
02:11:24,180 --> 02:11:26,260
Like it's so huge now

1136
02:11:27,140 --> 02:11:32,260
That it's taken over. It's so in the mainstream at this point that I feel like this should be more than like a few categories

1137
02:11:34,420 --> 02:11:38,739
It's hard to recognize everybody when you have one category

1138
02:11:46,939 --> 02:11:49,180
Keep coping. That's what i'm doing

1139
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:02,180
best narrative wait

1140
02:12:02,180 --> 02:12:04,180
Is this an original narrative?

1141
02:12:10,460 --> 02:12:13,329
a surprise

1142
02:12:13,329 --> 02:12:18,289
There are so many people responsible for making this such a wonderful thing

1143
02:12:18,289 --> 02:12:22,850
I want to thank marvel game studios for trusting us with their characters

1144
02:12:23,409 --> 02:12:25,729
And for allowing us to make them our own

1145
02:12:26,210 --> 02:12:31,170
For our fabulous cast bringing them to life in ways that words on a page can never do

1146
02:12:31,970 --> 02:12:33,329
for olivier

1147
02:12:33,409 --> 02:12:38,850
Does it takes two on there you bear day up my game director the entire crew who worked on it

1148
02:12:39,409 --> 02:12:41,810
And of course my wonderfully wild wacky

1149
02:12:43,409 --> 02:12:45,409
immensely talented writers

1150
02:12:45,649 --> 02:12:52,850
Thank you for making comedy the game is really good. Yeah, I heard that too not complaining too often when I pushed you

1151
02:12:53,329 --> 02:12:57,329
To remember our main themes of grief and to go deeper

1152
02:12:57,970 --> 02:13:01,470
Who am I kidding? I know you complained, but thank you for not doing it to me

1153
02:13:02,109 --> 02:13:05,149
Thank you everyone this is an honor

1154
02:13:09,340 --> 02:13:15,180
I think the the problem that anybody that works on a huge popular franchise license thing

1155
02:13:16,380 --> 02:13:18,859
is even if it is really good you have to fight against the sort of

1156
02:13:19,500 --> 02:13:25,250
Stigma of being the licensed video game. You're already up against a pretty high wall

1157
02:13:34,909 --> 02:13:36,909
But yeah, I heard I actually heard it was pretty good

1158
02:13:46,369 --> 02:13:48,449
I'm not gonna play it but I heard it was good

1159
02:13:49,170 --> 02:13:50,770
I don't play video games

1160
02:13:50,770 --> 02:14:17,520
This kind of reminds me of uh, like wind waker. Can't you float around in wind waker?

1161
02:14:18,239 --> 02:14:30,939
You'd be a bird too

1162
02:14:30,939 --> 02:14:48,260
i'm interested

1163
02:14:48,260 --> 02:15:02,239
That looks cute

1164
02:15:02,239 --> 02:15:08,880
What a beautiful game. All right. Now we have something very special the gameplay world premiere trailer for rocksteady's newest title

1165
02:15:09,340 --> 02:15:15,760
Suicide squad killed the justice league. We've all been waiting anxiously for them to give us a first look at

1166
02:15:17,359 --> 02:15:20,319
It crashed it flipped on your crash they crashed

1167
02:15:21,279 --> 02:15:22,800
Kaylee

1168
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:24,800
What the hell you think you're doing?

1169
02:15:26,859 --> 02:15:28,859
That footage is strictly classified

1170
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:40,609
My name is director amanda waller

1171
02:15:41,699 --> 02:15:46,829
Are you my cringe and since the game awards doesn't care about

1172
02:15:47,369 --> 02:15:55,180
Disclosing classified intel listen up. I was being somebody in the audience about task force f

1173
02:15:55,260 --> 02:15:57,500
That wasn't me. There's somebody in the audience

1174
02:15:57,739 --> 02:15:59,920
Justice league or superman

1175
02:16:00,619 --> 02:16:08,850
Rampaging through the streets of metropolis you better not say a word ever to anyone because if you do believe you me

1176
02:16:09,539 --> 02:16:26,000
I'll hear that you've all been brawler out. I was like we don't know who that was

1177
02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:28,960
Does anyone know who that is? She's gone. Good. All right

1178
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:33,920
Well, I think we've waited long enough to see rocksteady's new game. This is gonna be worth the risk

1179
02:16:34,159 --> 02:16:35,840
You guys want to do it?

1180
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:38,979
Let's all watch this together

1181
02:16:39,940 --> 02:16:45,260
Think of the justice league I think of wonder woman

1182
02:16:46,059 --> 02:16:47,420
superman

1183
02:16:47,420 --> 02:16:51,420
Green lantern, you don't want to mess with that one, but you

1184
02:16:52,540 --> 02:16:54,000
Barry

1185
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:58,879
You're just the team mascot. Aren't you mate the loser of the league folks?

1186
02:16:59,360 --> 02:17:02,159
The fastest man alive. It's

1187
02:17:05,360 --> 02:17:09,010
Splash is alive and he's playing for team brainiac

1188
02:17:09,969 --> 02:17:15,170
I gave you orders kill the flash. I'll kill you myself

1189
02:17:18,129 --> 02:17:20,129
I just hope the joker's in

1190
02:17:46,299 --> 02:17:51,520
Why don't you just mail me the bullet i'm the eye in the sky taking point

1191
02:17:54,850 --> 02:17:58,370
Is it like multiplayer or you pick a character I don't know

1192
02:17:59,170 --> 02:18:29,620
Co-op it's a gun type game. Oh, who are you going to main?

1193
02:18:30,020 --> 02:18:59,649
Uh, mr. Furious, uh, either that or the spleen i'm not sure it looks like it could be kind of fun

1194
02:19:10,020 --> 02:19:15,319
Is that just from fear? Oh shit

1195
02:19:27,540 --> 02:19:37,940
I'm probably not gonna play it. You may have met the character I portray in forespoken

1196
02:19:38,319 --> 02:19:39,360
Frey holland

1197
02:19:39,360 --> 02:19:45,760
I am so excited to be here to announce a brand new trailer and especially delighted tonight as we will be seeing

1198
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:49,920
Pollyanna's first portrayal of tanta prav for the very first time

1199
02:19:50,559 --> 02:19:56,000
She is a ruthless adversary for fray and I hope players get into it looking for a boss fight with this woman at some point

1200
02:19:57,659 --> 02:19:59,659
I definitely hope that you're in a boss fight

1201
02:20:00,139 --> 02:20:05,100
Thank you. Ella. That's so kind even if it is with fray, especially if it if it's with fray

1202
02:20:07,100 --> 02:20:10,000
And now a world premiere trailer for forespoken

1203
02:20:10,479 --> 02:20:12,879
I

1204
02:20:12,879 --> 02:20:17,120
Stop pretending to be interested. You're not going to play any of these games

1205
02:20:17,360 --> 02:20:20,000
You'll be too busy playing like fart simulator

1206
02:20:21,100 --> 02:20:28,079
2013

1207
02:20:41,559 --> 02:20:48,770
The truth really hurts it does it hurts i'll play elden ring, you know, I will

1208
02:20:57,909 --> 02:21:08,870
Hey, dude, you're gonna play destiny pvp tomorrow start banning people that say that for like an hour at least

1209
02:21:09,190 --> 02:21:32,719
Oh

02:21:32,719 --> 02:21:35,600
You guys are so fucking funny. Seriously

1211
02:21:36,479 --> 02:21:42,239
Like this is what I could I like i'm gonna have so much trouble stopping streaming eventually

1212
02:21:44,479 --> 02:21:46,719
I you guys are just so funny like

1213
02:21:47,440 --> 02:21:48,719
sometimes

1214
02:21:48,719 --> 02:21:51,110
Okay, it's some of the shit you guys say so

1215
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:53,520
Oh, I love it

1216
02:21:53,520 --> 02:22:17,940
What is this?

1217
02:22:17,940 --> 02:22:20,579
Is it if it's a warhammer? I have a very personal

1218
02:22:21,200 --> 02:22:22,579
personal

1219
02:22:22,659 --> 02:22:24,659
Rudge against warhammer 40k

1220
02:22:26,629 --> 02:22:27,909
That's what it is

1221
02:22:27,909 --> 02:22:32,899
When dawn of war 2 came out

1222
02:22:33,059 --> 02:22:38,180
I was so excited because I thought they were gonna eventually put in the tau because the tau is what I played in the original

1223
02:22:38,180 --> 02:22:40,180
dawn of war games, right

1224
02:22:41,590 --> 02:22:43,590
They just don't give a shit about the tau

1225
02:22:45,399 --> 02:22:47,719
I love that. It's they're awesome

1226
02:22:48,440 --> 02:22:50,440
the battle suits the

1227
02:22:52,120 --> 02:22:55,010
I'm a tau player. Yeah

1228
02:22:55,010 --> 02:22:59,329
And they kept putting in this shit that we've already seen a thousand times like dawn of war 3. Let's do in this one

1229
02:22:59,489 --> 02:23:01,649
No tau tau. No, no, no, no, no never again

1230
02:23:02,530 --> 02:23:17,010
Tau is in the game. Yeah, they added tau to the game when the shit had like eight concurrent players on steam

1231
02:23:21,479 --> 02:23:25,860
It took too long

1232
02:23:25,860 --> 02:23:28,840
I love dawn of war. It's like one of my favorite rts franchises

1233
02:23:30,020 --> 02:24:01,079
But i'm very curious what this is space marine 2

1234
02:24:09,510 --> 02:24:11,430
That's that. All right. That's cool

1235
02:24:11,430 --> 02:24:17,190
Put the tau in that game put the tau in this game

1236
02:24:17,829 --> 02:24:25,190
Joining me now is tim willis from saber and the star of the game who will play captain titus clive stand and

1237
02:24:25,989 --> 02:24:30,149
Tim, what do we just see? Well, i'm just so excited. I can finally talk about this game

1238
02:24:30,309 --> 02:24:30,549
You know

1239
02:24:30,549 --> 02:24:37,430
We are making space marine 2 a sequel to the iconic, you know warhammer 40k game, you know and at saber

1240
02:24:38,309 --> 02:24:44,649
You know, we've uh, we're using the experience that we have we have learned from games like halo quake champions

1241
02:24:45,270 --> 02:24:50,149
World war z to really bring this game to life to make it the most intense action game ever

1242
02:24:50,549 --> 02:24:53,989
And we've got clive as a space marine. It's awesome

1243
02:24:54,389 --> 02:24:56,870
Clive, how does it feel to be in the game? This would be fun. It's a dream

1244
02:24:57,670 --> 02:25:03,030
A pretty bleak and grim dream, but anyone's ever seen any of the work i've done. I'm not scared of the darkness

1245
02:25:04,229 --> 02:25:06,549
No, it's it's i'm stoked and grateful to be a part of this

1246
02:25:06,870 --> 02:25:10,950
I used to play with and paint the space marines when I was a kid with my older brother

1247
02:25:11,030 --> 02:25:17,350
So the chance to play one of the most iconic characters in the warhammer 40k universe is is everything to me

1248
02:25:17,430 --> 02:25:19,190
So it fits you looks looks good

1249
02:25:19,270 --> 02:25:23,350
So we're excited to see more of the game and awesome for you guys to show the gameplay tim clive

02:28:04,799 --> 02:28:13,030
Is this still is this still a thing one of the reasons why I stopped playing fall guys is because they were

1259
02:28:13,510 --> 02:28:16,549
Like seven games in the whole game. There were like seven maps

1260
02:28:17,430 --> 02:28:19,430
Is that have they updated it?

1261
02:28:19,510 --> 02:28:23,280
Like all those brand deals

1262
02:28:23,760 --> 02:28:25,760

This is the action adventure category and metroid dread checks off both the action and the adventure box

1309
02:33:22,389 --> 02:33:28,149
It's filled with action-packed moments behind every door around every corner and I have to play

1310
02:33:28,709 --> 02:33:36,229
A metroid game it introduces us to a massive and mysterious new planet that players can explore and adventure through

1311
02:33:36,959 --> 02:33:40,000
It's the result of a true collaboration between nintendo

1312
02:33:40,639 --> 02:33:45,520
And mercury steam and I have a few comments that the developers asked me to read on their behalf

1313
02:33:46,559 --> 02:33:51,889
We'd like to say a big thank you for this award from the development teams at nintendo and mercury steam

1314
02:33:52,370 --> 02:33:58,370
That worked so hard to bring all the metroid fans around the world the experience that they were hoping somebody said

1315
02:33:58,370 --> 02:34:03,489
It's like a dmt trip looking at the background in this dangerous yet marvelous journey

1316
02:34:03,889 --> 02:34:10,450
To zdr we're so thankful for all the fans for enjoying metroid dread on nintendo switch. Thank you very much

1317
02:34:12,209 --> 02:34:30,760
I don't know what a dmt trip is like. I have no idea biggest death trap in all history

1318
02:34:31,479 --> 02:34:35,170
And then into its jewels start with dread

1319
02:34:35,969 --> 02:34:38,280
Maybe I will and see power

1320
02:34:38,440 --> 02:34:44,209
Here we must scrabble for desert power move slowly the day of your revenge will come

1321
02:34:44,450 --> 02:34:51,170

1322
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
Dude look at that hand

1323
02:35:09,159 --> 02:35:11,159
I'm not bored. I promise

1324
02:35:14,520 --> 02:35:18,360
My vengeance this is my doom

1325
02:35:19,319 --> 02:35:21,319
dude spice wars

1326
02:35:21,719 --> 02:35:31,520
How does that work? You need another edible?

1327
02:35:33,569 --> 02:35:41,010
I I did not do anything of the stars of the upcoming tiny tina's wonderlands ashley birch and will arnett

1328
02:35:42,049 --> 02:35:45,760
What's this gonna be?

1329
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:47,680
Oh, that's the rheses guy

1330
02:35:47,680 --> 02:35:50,309
That's the rheses guy

1331
02:35:50,309 --> 02:35:54,709
Yeah, there's no wrong way to eat a rheses. Thank you. Ah, don't listen to them eat it wherever you want

1332
02:35:55,750 --> 02:36:00,530
The story in tiny tina's wonderlands. Yeah, and are we talking about the dragon lord yet?

1333
02:36:01,969 --> 02:36:06,209
Yes, will plays the dragon lord the essential villain within the wonderlands

1334
02:36:06,530 --> 02:36:06,930
Yes

1335
02:36:06,930 --> 02:36:11,649
But in a clever twist I turn out to be the underdog hero of the entire realm

1336
02:36:11,969 --> 02:36:15,649
And it's really beautiful and it's actually one of the main reasons that I took this role. So

1337
02:36:16,450 --> 02:36:18,450
So is this like a borderlands game?

1338
02:36:20,290 --> 02:36:22,129
What do you mean no

1339
02:36:22,129 --> 02:36:26,290
You play a necromantic overlord and not the good kind

1340
02:36:26,930 --> 02:36:32,770
Well, he's a job creator for millions of unemployed individuals. He races the dead man

1341
02:36:33,090 --> 02:36:35,090
Yeah, and he gives them stuff to do

1342
02:36:35,489 --> 02:36:36,450
Okay

1343
02:36:36,450 --> 02:36:38,450
Some of them get to sail

1344
02:36:38,530 --> 02:36:40,530
Some for all right, let me be in the audience

1345
02:36:41,170 --> 02:36:43,729
A lot of them like I don't know stab things or something

1346
02:36:44,979 --> 02:36:47,940
Do you really not know the story of the game that you're sure?

1347
02:36:48,180 --> 02:36:52,500
No, you know, you mean the the whimsical adventure from the mind of a 13 year old demolitions

1348
02:36:53,139 --> 02:36:55,139
expert yeah who whimsically

1349
02:36:55,780 --> 02:37:02,180
Tries to blow up the heroes for 40 levels. Yeah, so if anyone is the central villain here, it's tiny tina

1350
02:37:02,260 --> 02:37:04,260
All right, roll the damn trailer

1351
02:37:04,979 --> 02:37:09,600
How'd they go

1352
02:37:09,600 --> 02:37:12,559
There is a two clap andy the border and that's usually me

1353
02:37:13,440 --> 02:37:15,440
a world forged by wonder

1354
02:37:15,520 --> 02:37:21,639
And ruled i'm usually the two clap andy that laughs and does that one alone who can with fate

1355
02:37:22,120 --> 02:37:25,479
One alone whose story is in their own hands

1356
02:37:26,040 --> 02:37:26,979

1357
02:37:26,979 --> 02:37:29,149

1361
02:37:42,829 --> 02:37:47,950
I am this feels like a school assembly adventurer the scary stabby one is fred

1362
02:37:48,670 --> 02:37:57,329
The undead fall beneath our senses some real evil vibes this way. I think it's fine

1363
02:37:58,290 --> 02:38:01,090
What's wrong with it a beautiful body indeed?

1364
02:38:01,649 --> 02:38:03,090

1365
02:38:03,090 --> 02:38:04,049

He is a proponent of a theory called animal

And this category represents another innovation in our industry

1484
02:51:54,579 --> 02:51:57,540
This is the award for best ongoing game

1485
02:51:58,899 --> 02:52:02,979
It used to be that a game would ship and that would be the game

1486
02:52:04,709 --> 02:52:10,709
But today's developers keep players coming back to their beloved titles again and again

1487
02:52:11,510 --> 02:52:15,030
By delivering and creating exciting new content

1488
02:52:15,879 --> 02:52:20,760
Here are the five nominees for engaging their audiences. I would love year after year

1491
02:52:54,840 --> 02:52:58,520
That game award for the best ongoing game goes to

02:53:01,219 --> 02:53:08,709

1495
02:53:31,079 --> 02:53:37,000
Not fortnight. No, not this time. The category had so many amazing nominees that it's truly

1496
02:53:37,559 --> 02:53:39,159
fortunate that we were able to win

1497
02:53:39,159 --> 02:53:43,079

1503
02:54:06,600 --> 02:54:08,840

02:54:09,319 --> 02:54:19,360
We got another permit. There's been so many of these

1505
02:54:28,209 --> 02:54:31,809
Since the dawn of time we helped the glory of competition

1506
02:54:32,610 --> 02:54:35,680
Wasn't always what you'd call friendly

1507
02:54:36,879 --> 02:54:42,000
As civilization evolved so did the desire for battle and the drive to be the best

1508
02:54:43,360 --> 02:54:47,120
Cities grew and soon everyone wanted a piece of the action

1509
02:54:49,059 --> 02:54:53,920
Some for power

1510
02:54:57,120 --> 02:55:03,649
Oh, come on

1511
02:55:04,129 --> 02:55:23,270
It's like a melee game

1512
02:55:23,510 --> 02:55:31,909
Don't mock me. I didn't win. That's fine though. I don't have to win. I don't have to win a content creator here

1513
02:55:32,790 --> 02:55:57,600
What the hell is going on?

1514
02:56:02,200 --> 02:56:07,219
I mean a lot of people just jump off of buildings in the super mario pose

1515

This be the verse you crave for me

1527
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:40,200
Come on, you've seen worse than this here. He lies

1528
02:57:40,920 --> 02:57:44,790
Where he longed to be is the sailor

1529

1609
03:08:44,209 --> 03:08:48,770
The stories that I know my back was to the world that was smiling when I turned

1610
03:08:49,489 --> 03:08:52,290
I gotta get off. Yeah, I feel like i'm like dad at the concert with your kids

1611
03:08:54,770 --> 03:09:02,260
Like my kids are having a great time, but i'm just here and like watching them chaperoning

1612
03:09:10,819 --> 03:09:19,639
I'm not saying anything about the music. I'm just saying like my reaction there was like why am I not reacting?

1613
03:09:37,510 --> 03:09:45,639
Arcane is good. Yeah, I know

1614
03:09:47,719 --> 03:10:08,440
Why am I not singing

1615
03:10:08,680 --> 03:10:10,680
We have this many people that hate this band

1616
03:10:29,680 --> 03:10:31,680
I don't listen to music, so I don't know

1617
03:10:58,840 --> 03:11:00,840
No, I I really don't listen to music

1618
03:11:01,559 --> 03:11:18,319
Not that much

1619
03:11:18,319 --> 03:11:21,280
If you don't listen to music and you don't play games and what the fuck do you do?

1620
03:11:22,559 --> 03:11:24,500
cartography

1621
03:11:24,500 --> 03:11:26,500
My spare time wood burning

1622
03:11:49,510 --> 03:11:53,030
You work at the cheesecake factory why do you have to answer I have to answer that question

1623
03:11:53,590 --> 03:11:58,790
Why are we the cheesecake factory to make the game awards live stream more accessible including an audio descriptive stream

1624
03:11:59,030 --> 03:12:03,590
Asl stream with deaf gamers tv on twitch and closed captions. It's important

1625
03:12:03,909 --> 03:12:07,030

To make sure games can be accessed and played by all

1632
03:12:42,000 --> 03:12:47,040
It's incredible to see the effort developers put into prioritizing people who often go ignored

1633
03:12:47,600 --> 03:12:49,920
Sharing their work with as many people as possible

1634
03:12:50,239 --> 03:12:55,040
And that's why we love being able to show our gratitude to those who go above and beyond each year

1636
03:13:01,579 --> 03:13:04,100
Innovation in accessibility presented by chevrolet

1637
03:13:05,760 --> 03:13:14,250
Update that will be coming shortly after launch players will be able to enable a sign language interpreter

1638
03:13:16,559 --> 03:13:23,670
I just I so badly want to kind of take the edges and go like what not hard but just like enough

1639
03:13:24,389 --> 03:13:28,899
500 miles down a treacherous valley in the wake of an invading world

1640
03:13:29,860 --> 03:13:33,760
I'm talking about like this like he grabs like the sides and just goes like

1641
03:13:37,920 --> 03:13:39,920
I really like that

1642
03:14:08,530 --> 03:14:11,329
This award means means so much to our team because

1643
03:14:11,889 --> 03:14:18,049
Everyone at playground games is really committed to accessibility so much so that we made it one of our core pillars

1644
03:14:18,690 --> 03:14:20,770
for forza horizon

1645
03:14:20,770 --> 03:14:25,090
around the world there are about a billion players who have some sort of

1646
03:14:26,530 --> 03:14:28,530
Makes I think my brain is too smart for them

1647
03:14:29,090 --> 03:14:35,729
And I think it's great that us as developers and as creators can add in accessibility features and options and just open the magic

1648
03:14:36,129 --> 03:14:38,129
games to more and more players

1649
03:14:38,530 --> 03:14:40,530
It's cars. I a few people

03:14:40,930 --> 03:14:45,010
Um, I'd like to thank alan hartman. Why do I think that force is so complicated?

1651
03:14:45,409 --> 03:14:48,290
It's driving a car and all of team xbox

1652
03:14:59,750 --> 03:15:01,750

Extreme co-op horror game. Yes, and we thought what better way to announce 1.0

1663
03:15:53,010 --> 03:15:57,489
We've been in early access now for two years. What better way to announce 1.0 than to come back

03:16:12,450 --> 03:16:12,690

1671
03:16:20,370 --> 03:16:24,530
And uh anymore lip balm. That's not a bad idea. Let's let's take a look. We've got to take a look at the trailer

Co-op horror shooter this game rocks resource scavenged. I give you one more chance

1674
03:17:12,760 --> 03:17:17,989
There's only one

1675
03:17:19,350 --> 03:17:24,280
Bring it what it wants or die

1676
03:17:25,000 --> 03:17:30,079
It's really good. Hmm really dark, please peep this peep it, please

1677
03:17:30,639 --> 03:17:57,120
Monsters wait, why are we here?

1678
03:18:00,209 --> 03:18:04,309
Terrible things that we do

1679
03:18:04,870 --> 03:18:06,950
To deserve such hell

1680
03:18:08,500 --> 03:18:11,620
I just thought of the person that sits at the ball should be a critical hit

1681
03:18:21,700 --> 03:18:23,700
We don't have to work together

1682
03:18:23,780 --> 03:18:26,790
Or we don't die together

1683
03:18:27,670 --> 03:18:37,250
Wow, that looks fun. It actually looks pretty good. I am

1684
03:18:38,680 --> 03:18:48,840
Intrigued for sure. So is it that new content or is that just the game is a game that exists?

1685
03:18:48,840 --> 03:18:51,639
I go by mike the quad and I stream on twitch

1686
03:18:53,989 --> 03:18:55,989
It's really hard military in

1687
03:18:56,530 --> 03:18:57,750
2008

1688
03:18:57,750 --> 03:19:04,389
When we came back, I was involved in a motorcycle accident trying to figure out how to use a controller without

1689
03:19:05,030 --> 03:19:09,530
Having any hand function. What's up everybody that kind of sparked my advocacy

1690
03:19:10,549 --> 03:19:14,649
I wholeheartedly believe it kickstarts a patient's rehabilitation

1691
03:19:30,879 --> 03:19:32,879
Somebody said are you a new streamer?

1692
03:19:34,559 --> 03:19:36,559

You pick your champions they're glorious and their shields. Oh they glisten like

03:20:07,090 --> 03:20:13,889
Wet otters, but the bad guys they're lovecraftian. They're spooky. They're um, i'm big and then you go to battle and it's like

1701
03:20:16,209 --> 03:20:20,610

03:20:41,799 --> 03:20:43,799
Holy shit, they're everywhere

1707

03:21:57,270 --> 03:21:59,909
In huge letters, we protect humanity

1717
03:22:00,069 --> 03:22:08,079
Whatever the cost in fact the aliens that find us eventually are going to think that the raid shadow legends lore was our actual history

1718
03:22:08,079 --> 03:22:09,680
as a species

1719
03:22:09,680 --> 03:22:15,059
That will be their history

1720
03:22:15,059 --> 03:22:16,180
of us

1721
03:22:16,180 --> 03:22:22,899
Yeah, there won't be a bible anymore. It'll be the book of raid shadow legends

1722
03:22:23,459 --> 03:22:27,239
And all the characters that are in the game and shit

1723
03:22:28,520 --> 03:22:47,239
Aren't aren't there like content creators in raid shadow legends or something?

03:22:48,360 --> 03:22:50,840

1725
03:22:51,319 --> 03:22:58,040
Me saying the word raid shadow legends. It's like me promoting water to you. It's like hey, there's water exists on earth

1726
03:22:59,639 --> 03:23:06,440
It's already it's everywhere. I can't do it anymore television showtime and 343 industries bring the legendary master chief to life

1727
03:23:06,600 --> 03:23:13,079

03:24:32,520 --> 03:24:37,159
So making games that are original innovative and really push the medium forward

1741
03:24:37,719 --> 03:24:45,479
Is not easy at all. It's the culmination of the work and talent of hundreds and hundreds of people and countless hours

1742
03:24:46,200 --> 03:24:49,479
And it only happens when there's a clear shared vision

1743
03:24:50,200 --> 03:24:52,200
Of what a game can be

1744
03:24:52,680 --> 03:24:57,479
These nominees for best game direction represent what's possible when it all comes together

It's dehydrated

1754
03:25:47,920 --> 03:25:53,920
Dude, I drank this big ass water over the last hour or two. It's like 40 ounces. It's huge

1755
03:25:55,040 --> 03:25:57,040
I am not dehydrated

1756
03:25:59,969 --> 03:26:03,809

1757
03:26:04,610 --> 03:26:06,290
game director

1760
03:26:13,409 --> 03:26:14,530
and

1761
03:26:14,530 --> 03:26:16,770
Actually, I don't mean that as a brag

1762
03:26:17,649 --> 03:26:19,649
It was terrifying

1763
03:26:19,889 --> 03:26:24,209
Terrifying for us terrifying for the team. It looks like you made it a plastic. So

1764
03:26:24,850 --> 03:26:28,129
Yeah, I really want to thank the arcane leon team

Good evening

1805
03:29:14,659 --> 03:29:19,799
Please enjoy my gift a new trailer for elden ring

1806
03:29:20,760 --> 03:29:26,290
I don't want to be spoiled another world premiere trailer. Thanks, buddy. Let's check it out

1807
03:29:27,489 --> 03:29:55,840
It happened an age ago, but when I recall I see it true on a night of wintry fog

1808
03:29:56,319 --> 03:30:04,709
The rune of death was stolen

1809
03:30:13,280 --> 03:30:15,280
And the demigods began to fall

1810
03:30:18,579 --> 03:30:20,579
Starting with godwin the golden

1811
03:30:31,059 --> 03:30:33,459
Queen marika was driven to the brink

1812
03:30:46,920 --> 03:30:50,680
The shattering ensued a war that wrought only darkness

1813
03:30:52,360 --> 03:30:54,360
The elden ring was broken

1814
03:30:55,399 --> 03:30:57,399
But by whom?

1815
03:30:57,399 --> 03:31:15,889
And why?

1816
03:31:19,940 --> 03:31:23,219
What could the demigods ever hope to win by force?

1817
03:31:38,920 --> 03:31:45,760
The conqueror of the stars general

1818
03:31:54,850 --> 03:32:03,299
And the blade of mickle and milania the seven these two were the mightiest to remain and locked horns in combat

1819
03:32:07,059 --> 03:32:21,969
But there would be no victor

1820
03:32:30,600 --> 03:32:33,340
And so we inhabit a fractured world

1821
03:32:35,399 --> 03:32:37,399
Awaiting the arrival of the elder

1822
03:32:43,350 --> 03:32:45,350
Unless of course

1823
03:32:47,030 --> 03:32:49,030
Thou shouldst take the crown

1824
03:33:00,229 --> 03:33:09,600

1832
03:33:50,079 --> 03:33:52,399
This is gonna be like a five-hour broadcast

1833
03:33:53,680 --> 03:34:00,360
Holy smokes

1834
03:34:00,360 --> 03:34:05,559
So are we actually at real commercials now? Should I just leave like go full screen break off old timer?

1835
03:34:05,639 --> 03:34:15,959
You don't think I know ever break a rule to rule two. Oh, you're one of them. I've got all break off

1836
03:34:16,280 --> 03:34:18,280
You know you want to

1837
03:34:23,120 --> 03:34:26,959
Well respect this rocket league, but seriously break off

1838
03:34:29,459 --> 03:34:35,860
I fell into games and I lived and breathed. Yeah, well, we might play monster rancher. I just never knew that it could be a job

1839
03:34:36,100 --> 03:34:37,780
Really depends how long this is

1840
03:34:37,780 --> 03:34:40,370
What hold on?

1841
03:34:40,370 --> 03:34:41,870
it's

1842
03:34:41,870 --> 03:34:43,870
750

1843
03:34:44,770 --> 03:34:46,770
So that means

1844
03:34:46,770 --> 03:34:53,420
When did I start streaming 230 raised in malaysia? I came to the uk at age 19

1845
03:34:54,520 --> 03:34:59,479
If you're a minority working in video games, when did I start going through life five hours an imposter?

1846
03:35:00,920 --> 03:35:06,520
I think that's what made me wish I had somebody to talk to so I decided to create my own mentorship program

1847
03:35:07,000 --> 03:35:09,000
Maybe i'll play for like an hour

1848
03:35:09,879 --> 03:35:12,120
I don't know. Maybe i'll just come back on what's what's today?

1849
03:35:13,409 --> 03:35:14,610
thursday

1850
03:35:14,610 --> 03:35:21,879
Last weekend, maybe people just really want to be connected and be a part of a community saturday or sunday

1851
03:35:22,200 --> 03:35:26,360
I feel like anybody who wants to make video games. I mean this shit. I got a lot of viewers

1852
03:35:26,440 --> 03:35:31,700
So, I mean I might as well bring you over to our what's up everyone. I'm sydney goodman awesome game

1853
03:35:32,500 --> 03:35:34,500
Everyone is gonna love

1854
03:35:35,540 --> 03:35:38,020
I'll play it. I'm gonna play for an hour or two. I really want to play it

1855
03:35:38,659 --> 03:35:54,280
I feel like I want to play this

1856
03:35:56,959 --> 03:36:01,840
Wait, I was wondering I was like a sheet. Why is like blood coming out of her? I was like, what the fuck am I watching?

1857
03:36:03,459 --> 03:36:05,379
It was dumping stuff on her

1858
03:36:05,379 --> 03:36:16,180
I'm not going to switch to i'm not going to play it. I'm just going to open it to get ready

1859
03:36:16,659 --> 03:36:19,059
I promise i'm not going to play it. I just want to open it

1860
03:36:28,930 --> 03:37:06,549
I'm not playing it. I just make sure it's in the background. I'm not going to put it in the corner either. It's getting ready

1861
03:37:07,190 --> 03:37:20,799
Do we play split screen? No, I can't do that. Uh, we have literally 10 minutes

1862
03:37:22,629 --> 03:37:24,629
I have to go pee anyways, i'm holding it

1863
03:37:25,110 --> 03:37:40,659
Go pee now. Actually, this is a good this is a good time to go pee because the game was just in the background

1864
03:37:40,899 --> 03:37:42,899
Is it ads right? All right, i'll be right back

1865
03:37:43,219 --> 03:37:59,649
maybe

1866
03:38:57,139 --> 03:39:01,379
Hey everyone, my name is out of football my go-to is probably gonna be it takes two. Hi everybody

1867
03:39:01,780 --> 03:39:03,299
My pick is psychonauts, too

1868
03:39:03,299 --> 03:39:08,659
You're gonna have to give it to ratchet and claim ripped apart a pure joyride of fun from start to finish and that's hard to beat

1869
03:39:10,790 --> 03:39:20,309
That was a look at which game of the year nominees youtube creators and fans want to see win later tonight

1870
03:39:20,309 --> 03:39:23,030
We'll find out if they are right when we present game of the year

1871
03:39:23,430 --> 03:39:24,309
Every year at the game awards

1872
03:39:24,309 --> 03:39:27,510
We try to find games that push the medium forward in new and unexpected ways

1873
03:39:27,590 --> 03:39:31,989
This game comes from embark studios in sweden a new team of veteran developers

1874
03:39:32,149 --> 03:39:39,989
Their first game brings together thrilling multiplayer pve action a next-generation physical sandbox and incredible visuals to create a truly dynamic

1875
03:39:40,069 --> 03:39:43,670
Player experience. Here's the reveal complete with real gameplay

1876
03:39:44,389 --> 03:39:53,969
I'm back. I'm back. I'm back. I'm here. I'm here here. What'd I miss?

1877
03:40:01,489 --> 03:40:04,659
There is no way to hide kings

1878
03:40:05,809 --> 03:40:07,329
barons

1879
03:40:07,329 --> 03:40:09,010
queens

1880
03:40:09,010 --> 03:40:12,049
We give them different names, but they're all the same

1881
03:40:14,209 --> 03:40:16,370
killing machines falling from the sky

1882
03:40:16,530 --> 03:40:18,479
Okay

1883
03:40:18,479 --> 03:40:19,760
this

1884
03:40:19,760 --> 03:40:21,360
Is our home

1885
03:40:21,360 --> 03:40:24,100
our bastion of resistance

1886
03:40:24,979 --> 03:40:31,700
This is where the brave meets the bold. I was in the bathroom. Somebody said why does this person not talk die in the shadows?

1887
03:40:33,219 --> 03:40:35,219
We will face our fears

1888
03:40:36,149 --> 03:40:44,129
head on

1889
03:40:44,129 --> 03:40:49,959
Showtime

1890
03:40:50,360 --> 03:41:18,719
I can't resize it unless I can see it. That's just part of the trailer

1891
03:41:35,520 --> 03:41:39,200
Fuck what is this? What is this game?

1892
03:41:41,360 --> 03:41:43,600
Hey, this kind of looks like a edf with robots

1893
03:41:44,479 --> 03:42:07,639
They will never stop coming

1894
03:42:07,639 --> 03:42:15,510
Whoa?

1895
03:42:15,510 --> 03:42:17,270
All right, somebody write this down

1896
03:42:17,270 --> 03:42:19,329
It's called

1897
03:42:19,329 --> 03:42:21,329
ARC raiders

1898
03:42:21,329 --> 03:42:41,569
That was incredible and now we have two special guests joining us for a very special moment

1899
03:42:42,129 --> 03:42:43,969
karyann kiano

1900
03:42:43,969 --> 03:42:48,770
Welcome. I'm sure you guys recognize the iconic scene moment, right?

1901
03:42:49,729 --> 03:42:53,379
Jeff, thank you. It's good to be here at the game awards

1902
03:42:53,379 --> 03:43:00,420
And yes, this is one of the scenes that made the matrix feel so groundbreaking perhaps inspired a few video games, too

1903
03:43:02,020 --> 03:43:05,989
True that's true

1904
03:43:08,260 --> 03:43:14,200
Impressive. Thanks. Can you still do that? Absolutely not but I can in the unreal engine fog

1905
03:43:15,319 --> 03:43:21,020
I believe everyone here is expecting to see something new. So here's a never-before-seen look at the matrix resurrection

1906
03:43:21,559 --> 03:43:24,139
Exclusively for the game awards 2021

1907
03:43:25,020 --> 03:43:28,540
Let's roll the clip him and jim carrey. You have the same energy tonight

1908
03:43:39,030 --> 03:43:41,459
Where are we? Tokyo?

1909
03:43:41,700 --> 03:43:46,819
The moving portal makes I love both of these guys by the way portals clean reading our shadows

1910
03:43:47,700 --> 03:43:51,819
I don't remember this

1911
03:43:51,819 --> 03:43:53,819
We don't have to run to phone booths anymore either

1912
03:43:54,459 --> 03:44:24,170
Doors on your right set and setting right? Oh, no, it's all about set

1913
03:44:25,049 --> 03:44:30,389
And setting after our first contact went so badly. We thought elements from your past

1914
03:44:31,030 --> 03:44:34,149
Might help ease you into the present. Nothing comforts anxiety like

1915
03:44:35,370 --> 03:44:40,180
little nostalgia

1916
03:44:40,180 --> 03:44:44,659
The matrix resurrections looks awesome and we can't wait to watch it on december 22nd

1917
03:44:44,979 --> 03:44:50,340
But getting back to tonight's kind of feel like they got dmca'd midstream kiano. You've been in

1918
03:44:50,739 --> 03:44:53,540
Not you're not watching this movie immersive experiences

1919
03:44:53,860 --> 03:44:58,260
Uh, did you ever think that one day a game could look as real as being in the matrix?

1920
03:44:59,600 --> 03:45:00,899
Absolutely

1921
03:45:00,899 --> 03:45:05,620
I mean we are reaching the point of which the line between the physical and virtual worlds

1922
03:45:06,340 --> 03:45:08,180
are blurry

1923
03:45:08,180 --> 03:45:14,260
And with interactive storytelling reaching stunning levels of fidelity the same exact energy don't even tell me they don't ask

1924
03:45:14,819 --> 03:45:22,309
What is a game? What is a movie over 20 years ago? The matrix pushed the boundaries of filmmaking and visual effects

1925
03:45:22,790 --> 03:45:27,829
We couldn't have imagined where the state of the art would be today was photorealistic digital humans

1926
03:45:28,309 --> 03:45:30,790
In virtual sense in fact if you didn't tell me

1927
03:45:31,670 --> 03:45:36,309
Jim carrey could be dressed up as kiano reeves and kiano reeves could have been like dressed up in makeup as jim carrey

1928
03:45:39,190 --> 03:45:41,190
