1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:09,880
What's up? How you doing? Late? I know. Yeah, by five, by just five mini minutes, okay?

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:22,070
Five mini minutes. I think within five minutes is fine. Don't you agree? Look, they cancel your

3
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:27,109
doctor's appointment within 15, right? After 15. So if you get to your doctor's appointment

4
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:38,820
14 minutes late, they still take you. I'm here five. And then, hey, and then you gotta wait

5
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:53,130
40 for the doctor, right? You know what I mean? How you guys doing? I wanted to pop in. I know I

6
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:59,859
told you guys last week that the next few weeks are gonna be really tight, schedule-wise. A lot

7
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:04,180
of stuff going on. But I did not want to just disappear. I did want to hang out and have like

8
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,400
a chill stream and hang out with you guys for a while. You know, you've been calling me delay

9
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:15,879
Darryl, delay Danny the last few months. You're gonna have a new name for me. It's gonna be

10
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:23,420
Announcement Andrew. I'm gonna have like three things to talk about. I'm gonna be Announcement

11
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:40,170
Andy, like in a few weeks. Delay Dongus. Play Halo 3 with me. Like right now? You wanna play

12
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:49,909
Halo 3 with you right now? Not right now. No. Look, I don't wanna say no, but like I can't.

13
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:55,239
I don't even like, I don't play Halo. I can't, why am I responding to this?

14
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:05,260
No, I'm sorry. I'm not gonna play Halo 3 with you. Not right now. But look, just be honest. I'm

15
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:11,819
gonna be honest. I'm probably not gonna play Halo 3 with you. He's so high. No, I am not. I've just

16
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:23,219
got a T here. So today we're gonna do... Sorry. Today we're gonna do a couple of interesting

17
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:28,789
things. We're gonna play a game that I've been wanting to play. It's been on a bunch of polls

18
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:35,180
and it keeps getting vetoed. How dare that happen? We're gonna play Leaf Blower Revolution.

19
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,139
Just a chill game. We're gonna hang out. We're gonna see lots of resident sleepers tonight.

20
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:43,750
That's fine. God, that T was so hot. It's just like, it just like changed my voice.

21
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,860
But we're also gonna do something today that I've been kind of sitting in the back pocket

22
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:59,300
for a long time. We're gonna go over the Jerma Census that was taking place earlier this past

23
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:10,090
year. I'm not sure a lot of you've seen it. This is very interesting. Finally. Yeah. So we'll go

24
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:18,740
over that. It's pretty elaborate. The 2020... Yeah, we're gonna go over the 2020 census in 2021.

25
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:26,680
Come on, I'm a John Madden game. No, wait. It would be the reverse, wouldn't it? It would be

26
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:32,539
the 2021 census in 2021. Yeah, I fucked it up. It was the other way around. Reverse Madden.

27
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:40,969
Catboy waiting room. Yeah. Well, you're gonna have to just hold on.

28
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:52,870
Just let me do that the way that I want to do it. Please. Thank you. And thank you also. And thank

29
00:03:52,870 --> 00:04:02,469
you. Please again. I did that as a joke to make like a funny slurp sound. And the T went underneath

30
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:09,669
my tongue and hit behind my back bottom teeth and hurt. This is so hot. And I thought that was so

31
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:14,069
funny though, right? It was so funny to go like... But the way that I moved my mouth, I just burnt

32
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:19,990
underneath my tongue behind my back teeth on the bottom. Nice. That was wicked funny though.

33
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:28,899
Everybody thought it was fucking funny. Everybody laughed at it. All right, let's go. Leafblower

34
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:36,139
simulator. I keep saying leaf blower simulator, but that's not what this is. Thank you Slimes for

35
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:41,350
the five community subs. You got Slime in your name. You are automatically a family member

36
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:51,339
in the Slime family. Not my family, in the Slime family. Which I mean, what is this,

37
00:04:51,339 --> 00:05:00,569
Jerma? I told you I wanted to play this. I told you I wanted to play this. We went over

38
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:04,490
this like a million times. How many times have you guys been in the pre-stream chat and I was

39
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,009
like, I'm going to play leaf blower idle game. And people were like, oh man, don't play that.

40
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:13,379
That game sucks. And I'm like, I'm going to play it at one point. I'm going to play it.

41
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:21,959
This has happened like 10 times over the last two or three months. Hey, easy cash. Thanks for the

42
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:32,540
10 subs. Go get the Catboy dress. You're going to get the Catboy stream when I deem it necessary.

43
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:41,579
Okay. I can't wait for you guys to get so into this. You guys are going to, oh man,

44
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:45,660
it's a leaf blower game. This game's stupid. I don't even like leaf blowing. It's not even

45
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:51,939
the fall, Jeremy. Wait, what year is it? It's winter. It's not even the fall, Jeremy. It's

46
00:05:51,939 --> 00:06:00,360
winter time. Why would there be leaves on the ground? Do it again. Ooh, all right.

47
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:11,829
I'm an engineer. That means I like guns. More guns. I've never seen that video in a long time.

48
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:24,500
All right. This is way too loud. Ha ha. NG joke. Band that guy for five minutes. All right. So

49
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:36,889
what do I do? Oh, you just have to get them off the screen? Do I have money? How is this leaf

50
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:41,610
blowing? I'm just sprinting and the wind that I'm making from running is getting rid of this.

51
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:56,759
This is epic. What is this thing? Gold leaves, trees. Okay. This music has to go. Can we put our

52
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:07,529
own music on? This is going to drive me crazy. This is going to drive me crazy. Sound effects,

53
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:18,040
volume, master volume. Wait. Alternative font. No. But on Doom? Hold on. I don't even hear any

54
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:30,759
sound effects. Where's the music? All right. I need to find the music button. Hard reset. Oh,

55
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:38,569
it's right here. What am I stupid? How do I drop it? All right. We need our own OST. I am so dumb.

56
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:45,670
All right. We need our own OST. Look, the leaves are getting out of control. Hold on. What should

57
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:58,310
I put on? How about the one that goes? The Flintstones. Pushing away leaves with your

58
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:05,529
bare hands is so much fun. Okay. I get a rake for 50 leaf dollars. Get a rake. Pushing away leaves

59
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:15,750
with a rake. Guess you're doing it wrong. Oh, shit. This is perfect. Big bang theory OST. You

60
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:22,089
want to try to get me banned from this website? Wait, that made sounds. How do we get one sound

61
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:41,269
effect? That was it? I just get one sound effect. This is epic. Just wait. Just wait until the huge

62
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:49,529
crazy dark twist happens. I don't want to tell you guys about it, but man, you guys have no idea.

63
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:57,019
It's like a leaf blower again. No, there are bodies buried here. There are bodies buried here,

64
00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:01,580
and slowly as he cleans up the leaves, some of the bodies are going to get exposed,

65
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,419
and there's going to be skeletons and dead decomposing bodies and coffins and shit in here,

66
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:10,500
and this is a guy's backyard and he's a fucking serial killer. There you go. You play the game

67
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:19,610
now? You spoiled it. All right. I need an OST. Give me something. I'm going to beat this whole

68
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:34,019
game on stream, by the way. I'm on Doom 1. Turn it off. Bet on what? Put on Final Fantasy. How

69
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:49,259
about Silent Hill? Okay, I'm into that. Let's put on Silent Hill OST. That changes this whole

70
00:09:49,259 --> 00:10:06,980
thing. This makes this like a scary game. Let's go. I'm getting overwhelmed by leaves here.

71
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:19,080
I have $600. Hold on. I have $600 bucks. A $500 rake? Large rake. Better, but still feels wrong.

72
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:34,220
That feels pretty clean. I like it. I like it. How do I make the leaves produce more trees?

73
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,019
How do I make the trees drop more leaves on the ground for me to rake? That's important.

74
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:51,990
Come on, I need more money. Gold leaves. Trees can drop 10,000. Spawns one more leaf per tree each

75
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:59,340
step. Oh yeah, let's go. I'm making trees. I'm actually spawning trees around. This game is

76
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:13,980
fucking crazy. I like that. That feels pretty good. Yes, I am very well aware that this looks like

77
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:24,379
one of those mobile on your iPhone ads where the ad forces you to play the game for five

78
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:36,090
seconds before you're allowed to hit the X in the corner. It's always really laggy too.

79
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:42,809
How do they even do that? Why do they even do that? All right, I got $500 bucks. Wait,

80
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:52,679
I got a trophy. So many leaves. That's one Golden Emerald claim. How many Golden Emeralds do I have?

81
00:11:53,399 --> 00:12:03,879
I just got another one. Fruits. Wait, that you can get fruits and stuff?

82
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:08,950
Time played. The longer you play, the more achievements you get. Simple progress.

83
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:23,259
Playing that. How many minutes is that? It's an actual phone game. Yeah, I'm kind of having fun.

84
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:29,379
I like this. I've been waiting to play this game for months. I've been trying to find the opportunity

85
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:36,889
where I can put it in there. Leaves drop faster. 5% faster. All right, the leaves are dropping 10%

86
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:48,220
faster. I love it. I got to get a good strategy here. Up and down, up and down. That was a fruit.

87
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,120
That was one apple. I was waiting to play this. Yeah, this is like my most anticipated game of

88
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,620
the entire year besides Hitman 3, which comes out in like fucking eight days. So we're going to be

89
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:09,539
playing that. Is that me? All right, can you believe? I got to give some praise here. You

90
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:17,240
want to talk about video game companies? Here we go. How happy are you guys that IO Interactive

91
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:23,100
bought their assets out of Square Enix? And we're like, fuck this. We're buying ourselves out and

92
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:33,750
we're going to go independent. That means we got to get Hitman, the new one, and Hitman 2,

93
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,629
and now Hitman 3. And they've been coming out like every two years and they're fantastic.

94
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:42,039
Just so much fun. Let me give like some claps in the chat here for like IO Interactive and the

95
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:44,840
fact that like they're pumping out these fucking awesome games like once every like two, three

96
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:53,669
years. It's insane that they're able to do that. I got a thousand. What should I do? Leaf marketing?

97
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:06,149
No, I want to do more trees. Why is there somebody just hitting like pans or something? What is that?

98
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:20,570
All right, I'm out. It's Pyramid Head. You guys know that I played Silent Hill 1 when it first

99
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:27,929
came out and I thought the game was dog shit because I didn't get it. I thought the game was

100
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:37,179
terrible. I was young. I look, it wasn't like it wasn't fun for me. It was just like, this is stupid.

101
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:44,789
I hate this. I've walked around in like a bunch of like steam and I couldn't find the like diner or

102
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:51,240
whatever. And I was surrounded by mist. I was like, this game sucks. And I never played it again

103
00:14:51,240 --> 00:15:02,539
until I was like 30. Leaf marketing, you dingus. Hold on. I want to get over 2000.

104
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:11,049
I really don't like this OST. It's too, I don't like it for right now. I feel like I'm playing,

105
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:19,700
I feel like it's like Halloween. And you guys feel like this is Halloween right now? I need like a,

106
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:32,409
a January soundtrack. This is October. Here we go. That's a good technique. Feels good.

107
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:39,590
Fucking satisfying. Reddit. All right, wait, wait, wait, hold on. Well, I need 10k. Fertilizer?

108
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:54,809
Nuclear fuel? Holy shit. I'm already going nuclear. That just turned off really fast and

109
00:15:54,809 --> 00:16:03,700
fucking freaked me out. What's going on? I don't like that. Get a leaf blower, you idiot. Hold on.

110
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:17,750
Get a leaf blower. 5k. I need 5k. I don't even, I need $5,000. Look at that blowing power. This is

111
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:24,779
perfect. Oh, I love it. The apples are worth, okay. What are the apples worth? 200? That's it. Wait,

112
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:32,600
we got achievement. Fruits. What does that currency do? It's claim all, whatever. What's,

113
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:39,139
what's the apple currency? Okay. Plus one apple. What does it do? There are 10,000 people watching

114
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:46,940
this man clean up leaves. Yeah, that's it. Look, it's the experience. Right now you probably looked

115
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:51,350
outside and you were like, yeah, I still haven't done it. There are probably like a bunch of old

116
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:59,269
leaves on the ground that you didn't do since like November. And you just shut the window closed and

117
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:08,309
you go, nah, I'll just watch him do it instead. Break your leaves all the way into January. What

118
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:23,750
would even happen? The snow, it just decomposed. Oh, that would be bad. There's snow on the ground.

119
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:30,809
But don't you understand? I've wanted to play this game since like September or October of this past

120
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:37,640
year. Why would I have wanted to play leaf blowing simulator now? No, I'm catching up with what I

121
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:43,059
wanted to do four months ago. Otherwise, what? I got to wait a whole, I got to wait another year

122
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:49,509
to play this. No, you're going to do it. You're going to sit down and you're going to listen to

123
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:56,299
me play this game. And hold on, I got to get this off. This OST. This OST is making me nuts.

124
00:17:56,299 --> 00:18:08,759
Make me crazy. I got to turn this off. Let's skip halfway in. No, I don't like this. I want

125
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:16,089
something else. Give me something else. This is too much for me. I don't want to have like

126
00:18:16,089 --> 00:18:24,549
pyramid head chasing you down a hallway for an hour and a half. I don't know. Put on herbs?

127
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:43,859
URB herbs? What's herbs? Hotline Miami? That's a good one. I'll do that one. Yep. Oh yeah. Yeah,

128
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:50,299
this is like a 9.4. One reason why it's not a 10 is because I fucking hated every second of this

129
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:59,619
game. Wait, no, no, no. No, Hotline Miami 2 is the one, right? Look at that. Look at that. Look at

130
00:18:59,619 --> 00:19:05,849
that. Look at that. Look at that. No, Hotline Miami 2 is the one that I didn't like. I liked

131
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:11,460
Hotline Miami 1. I liked Hotline Miami 2 though. I just hated it. You guys get it. We're all gamers

132
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:19,160
here. All right. Let's get more trees. Yeah. No, I was supposed to get a leaf blower. Whatever. I

133
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:33,690
got plenty of time. Oh, it feels so good. It feels like I'm just like shaving. You guys ever shave

134
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:38,730
in the mirror and you have a ton of hair and you get that one clean line and you just go,

135
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:52,490
oh, you know. None of you guys have ever shaved before? You don't know what it's like to get like

136
00:19:52,490 --> 00:20:02,009
the clean line of like a... Oh, but I don't understand. I don't shave. I let it grow.

137
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:12,539
Maybe you have to have shaved at least once in your life. I'm 12. We're 12. No, you're not. You

138
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:17,740
know why I know that? Because I've got the goddamn census right in front of me. You're 12. Are you?

139
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:21,900
Well, that's interesting. We'll find out because I've got the census in front of me. I can see

140
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:37,349
exactly how old you are. I got to get a 5k. We lied on the census. That's illegal. So no, you didn't

141
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:52,759
prove it. But is that not illegal? I mean, it's illegal. Are there people that like take the

142
00:20:52,759 --> 00:21:05,049
census and say that like 400 people live in their house? That's illegal. Do you go to jail for that?

143
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:13,829
I don't think you're a court date. The judge is proceeding. Now, Mr. Albertson says here

144
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:20,230
that you are said on your census that 250,000 people lived in your residence. Is that correct?

145
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:28,119
That's correct, your honor. Now, why did you think that was so funny to mess with the census?

146
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:37,460
Very important thing, the census. We need to keep track of all kinds. You know what that does? You

147
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,740
know, that makes us so we can determine where the tax dollars go. That's what it's for.

148
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:45,539
I'm sorry. I'll never do it again. That's right. You'll never do it again

149
00:21:46,099 --> 00:21:52,200
because you're going to spend 24 months in prison. I'm sorry, doctor. I'm sorry,

150
00:21:52,200 --> 00:22:05,670
Dr. Phil. I'll never do it again. That's right. Adjourned. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, guys, guys,

151
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:10,869
guys, guarantee you. He's a 100% guarantee. Dr. Phil is going to have a Judge Judy show eventually

152
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:16,970
when he doesn't feel like doing the Dr. Phil show anymore. There will be a Dr. Phil has the big

153
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:24,230
Judge Robon show. Now you, now you tell me. Now you, you're going to get that. Now you,

154
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:41,960
you'll hear it 100 times an episode. The court of Phil. He's going to do it. I'm telling you,

155
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,019
he's going to do that. It's okay. I'll just be right. That's fine. Just wait for the battleship

156
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:51,500
meta to take over Twitch. Just wait and then come to me and tell me that I was wrong. I'm

157
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:59,779
waiting for you to tell me I was wrong. When you get like the people freaking out at each other

158
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:05,059
and like bunch of like threads about like the fucking battleship drama, you come to me and

159
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:21,109
tell me I was wrong. I want you to do it. Just give me six months. Wait, what happened? Oh shit,

160
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:27,059
we had a fucking raid. We had like a couple of braids. Kit Boga comes in with a raid. What's

161
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:40,470
going on, Kit? Kit Boga, resident funny man on the internet. Go follow Kit Boga if you haven't. He's

162
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:47,190
got one of the best streams on Twitch. Guaranteed by the way. That's a German 985 guarantee. Hope

163
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:55,559
you had a good stream. Hope you had a good new year too. That means nothing. Wait, what?

164
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:04,220
Hold on. The German 985 guarantee means nothing? Yeah, it doesn't at all.

165
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:12,470
Oh, you got to get the leaf blower. Hold on. Let me get the leaf blower. Leaf blower. This is fun.

166
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:24,519
Oh man. Look at this. Oh man. I need extra spawning. Oh, thanks for the, thanks for the raid.

167
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:28,420
Welcome guys. We're playing leaf blower simulator. That's not the name. The game is called leaf

168
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:35,140
blower revolution. We're just chilling today. I'm just having a chill stream. You know, nothing

169
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:40,630
weird is going to happen today. This is just leaf blowing, collecting apples and just hanging out

170
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:48,380
with you. Thanks for being here. We had another raid too. We had nice beaver. A few hundred people

171
00:24:48,380 --> 00:25:03,180
came in from nice beaver. Thanks for the raid. Where's the cat boy? Hope you had a good stream.

172
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:10,809
3000 people are gone. That's all you guys know how to raid works? All right. Let me ask you a

173
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:17,660
question. Everyone's saying 3k people left. Let me ask you a question. So when we raid somebody,

174
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:23,880
here we go. Here comes the census. When we raid somebody, how long do you stay there for

175
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:34,809
after the raid? Tell me. Five minutes, 10 minutes, an hour, few hours. No one's obligated to stay here

176
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:42,759
and watch me. They just consumed probably an awesome kit bogus stream. You know, maybe you got

177
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:46,920
to get stuff to do. You come in and say hello, jump into another stream and raid, and then you

178
00:25:46,920 --> 00:26:04,359
got stuff to do. You're like, all right, I'm going to take a break. Yummy stream. Hey, Seb,

179
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:11,859
Seb Burrito, thanks for the five subs, community subs. Thank you, Seb. How long is this song?

180
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:24,339
Is this like the 10 hour version of the first song? There we go. All right. There we go. I

181
00:26:24,339 --> 00:26:29,349
feel like I'm playing Hotline Miami. Don't you think so? Can you imagine like three guys coming

182
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:41,740
down here and it's like, next area. Hotline Miami is such a weird game. I always feel like I want

183
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:48,089
to play it again because it's so much fun to play it. But I've gone back to it once or twice, I think,

184
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,460
and you just instantly die like five times in a row in the first few levels. And you're like,

185
00:26:52,460 --> 00:27:07,640
no, I forgot. I don't want to do this ever again. Do a freestyle rap. All right. Okay.

186
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:17,579
The leaves have fallen. It's time for fall. It's having a ball. I'm off the wall. I'm seeing you.

187
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:24,059
I'm seeing you with my two eyes burning you through those, those, uh, those thighs and then,

188
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:46,230
uh, whatever. That was fucking awful. No, what do you want me to say? I try to find a word.

189
00:27:46,230 --> 00:28:06,440
Don't ever do that again. All right. Upgrades 500. Wait, where's my golden leaves? Wait, what?

190
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:15,140
Where's the golden leaf currency? Holy shit, there's so much. All right. Where's the golden

191
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:24,230
leaf? Trees can drop golden leaves. I need 10,000. One leaf per level. This is expensive.

192
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:29,829
One leaf per level by using advanced marketing techniques. Holy shit. That's two. That's plus

193
00:28:29,829 --> 00:28:49,819
two. That's plus two. That's all plus two. I need more spawn. I need more spawn. More spawn. More.

194
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:57,940
Bye bye. More marketing. All right. I'm going to save it for marketing free.

195
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:09,990
I need to take a sip since I burnt my mouth. There we go. Here's the ultimate test for all

196
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:13,109
you guys said that you would sit here and watch me like paint a fence or something.

197
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:20,380
I mean, you're struggling right now. Hovering over the X button. Just trying to find a reason to leave

198
00:29:21,099 --> 00:29:25,740
that you said in chat a year ago. I would watch you paint a fence. I would watch you do anything.

199
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:30,869
I would watch you just sit and stare at a wall, would you? Hovering over the fucking X button.

200
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:37,049
Remembering the promise you made to me. Are you going to keep your promise? Or are you going to

201
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:45,619
be a liar? We'll find out. We'll find out if you actually did what you said you were going to do.

202
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:55,940
I'm just really glad that you heard. Ah, they clicked it. They clicked it.

203
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:09,880
How much is it? Uh, two. All right. It's 12,000. Should I just go? I'm going to do it again.

204
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:21,019
Will you succumb to the boredom? Will you succumb to it? Or will you click that X?

205
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:28,140
You won't click that X. You won't click that X. You won't click that X. No, no, no, no. Wait.

206
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,460
There's a Jedi mind trick. They tell you to do it and you don't do it. You will click that X. No,

207
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,819
don't click it though. Does that work on you? What's the Jedi mind trick one? You wave your

208
00:30:35,819 --> 00:30:43,240
hand around and you say it, right? You will. You will shoot me in the chest.

209
00:30:44,200 --> 00:31:08,650
Shooting in chest. Roger. Force gas light. Oh no, not a robot chicken joke.

210
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:16,500
Obi-Wan's at the fucking grocery store and like his coupon expired. Sorry, Mr. Kenobi,

211
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:22,420
this coupon expired. You will give me another day on that 25% off laundry detergent coupon.

212
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:40,900
I will give you that 25% coupon. Yes. Oh no, he'd probably go, Jedi mind trick. Yes.

213
00:31:41,859 --> 00:32:00,519
Damn that guy. Me? How come every robot chicken reference that we've ever made has been about

214
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:06,809
a Star Wars routine that they do. Probably because that's what they do. It's either like

215
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:13,059
Thundercats, Star Wars, or like the Hulk. It's like every single joke they've ever made.

216
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:25,799
How does Mike? What? What did I say? It's whatever action figure they can get on sale.

217
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:34,009
All right. I need 12k, right? I need to buy any more leaves. This is bullshit.

218
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:54,500
You cracked the code after 15 years. Family Guy, Star Wars. Hey, you guys, you guys still make,

219
00:32:54,500 --> 00:33:01,079
you guys make Peter Griffin references all the time. I'm not sure what's happening with Family

220
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:06,900
Guy right now, but so Family Guy is like not funny anymore, right? Like I don't think it is,

221
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:15,109
but people, it like, it was funny for like five or six seasons and then it got like canned. They

222
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:19,910
brought it back. It was all right for a while and then everybody hated it and now nobody cares about

223
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:28,180
the show. They just like to meme the characters on the show. Like I see Peter Griffin fucking

224
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:34,680
everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, but you don't, nobody watches that show. I've seen like the holy

225
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:39,799
crap lowest like people are using Peter Griffin and like Stewie and stuff, but the show doesn't

226
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:56,440
even matter to them. It's weird, isn't it? Yeah. He's doing what? You are describing yourself.

227
00:33:58,089 --> 00:34:09,219
Yeah. Of what? So are you sure? But people like, all right, but wait a minute. Is this a scenario?

228
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:12,980
Okay. Are you telling me to like put milk up my nose in the cafeteria? Not because you like want

229
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,179
to watch me put milk up my nose, but you think I'm going to do it and it's funny that I will

230
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,699
actually put the milk up my nose. You don't actually care that I'm doing the milk up the

231
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:22,260
nose. You just know that I'm going to do it and I'm going to be like, holy shit, the guy put

232
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,579
fucking milk up his nose. You don't actually care about the milk going into my nose. You just like,

233
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:41,800
shocked that I'm going to do it in the first place. Really? Okay. Excuses.

234
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:51,670
All right. I need 12,000 and then I'm going to move on to a new weapon. Catboy stream. You need

235
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:57,429
to lap up milk. Let me tell you something. If you think for a second that it's just going to be me

236
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:03,639
with fucking cat ears on, if you think I'm just going to have cat ears on and like eye makeup on,

237
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:13,829
you are so wrong. It's insulting. Just wait. Just you wait. You'll see.

238
00:35:22,059 --> 00:35:37,659
All right. 12,000. I'm almost there. Maybe I should try horizontal. Yep. That's cleaner to me,

239
00:35:37,659 --> 00:35:44,730
I think. What do you think? Is that cleaner to you? All right. 12,000. Here we go.

240
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:50,889
Leaf marketing level three. Oh, that's a lot of money. All right. Now I have plus four. Let's go.

241
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:55,739
Now I'm going to get the leaves spawning here. How much is that? I need golden leaves to spawn.

242
00:35:58,809 --> 00:36:13,739
50 subs if you drink milk out of your nose. No, I'm not like 10. Okay. No, I don't want to do that.

243
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:27,000
I'm not going to drink milk through my nose. No, that's not happening. I'm sorry. If you think

244
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,809
you're going to get a guy drinking milk out of his nose today. No, I'd rather piss my pants on stream.

245
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,760
If you have that on the scale of things you would embarrassing things, oh my God,

246
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,289
of things you'd that, oh, but look at how crazy that was. That much hurt. I would rather stand up

247
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:48,409
and just pee into a pair of jeans than snort milk in my nose on stream.

248
00:36:49,909 --> 00:37:04,710
I'm serious. I really mean that. Two billion off the debt. Yeah, there won't be a debt anymore.

249
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:14,170
Won't be a channel anymore. Hey, if I get like permanently banned on Twitch, that means like

250
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:23,190
the debt goes away too, right? Like I can't pay it back. I'm going to like streamer prison. I mean,

251
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:32,780
no. If I go to like streamer, like banned streamer Twitch prison, how am I going to pay you back?

252
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:38,920
I'm literally in prison. What are you talking about? We will find you. Yeah, I'm in prison. You

253
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:45,139
can come like visit and I'll pick the phone up and you pick the phone up and you can just say like,

254
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:54,789
hell you well, I had you made it and hang up. Like I don't have to pay you. Oh, that was a good line

255
00:37:54,789 --> 00:38:04,730
right there. All right. Let's go. I got to claim some of this stuff. What do we got? Healthy fruits.

256
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:12,650
Uh, I, I don't, I want to hit claim all, but I want to see what I'm getting. You guys like that?

257
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:24,940
Oh, whatever. All right. I need 500 golden leaves. Freeze can drop gold leaves. Oh,

258
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:33,750
now I have that currency shit. Okay. How often does it drop? Not, not that often. Can I make

259
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:41,239
them spawn faster? Exchange? I didn't read it. So this is a huge spam and I missed it. I don't know

260
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:48,969
what I said. This is your lawyer speaking. I need you to whatever it says. Hi. This is your lawyer

261
00:38:48,969 --> 00:38:53,130
speaking. I need you to pay me the fee and kisses this time. I saw your stream on Thursday and it's

262
00:38:53,130 --> 00:39:10,599
being deleted. So I'm not going to read it. It's being deleted as fast as I can read it.

263
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:32,010
That's so funny. No. New upgrade menu. Where? Oh my God. There's a new upgrade menu. Platinum

264
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:39,860
leaves. Holy shit. I'm going to be here all day. We're going to go through like four OSTs today,

265
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:53,510
guys. I can't wait. Poggers. Pog. Poggers. Poggers. Poggers. Poggers. Poggers. There it is.

266
00:39:53,510 --> 00:40:05,400
Does Chuck E. Cheese even still stream? Or did he do that for like a week when Fall Guys was popular?

267
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:26,440
He quit because of you. All right. New OST. What do we got? Let's see some. Okay. I can do

268
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:40,710
spawns more leaves. Oh, wait. But hold on. What is this? I got to max this out, right? Fertilizer.

269
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:55,349
Dust Force? Nah. Nah. Maybe. Doom Eternal. No, we always go to Doom. No more Doom. Something else.

270
00:40:55,349 --> 00:41:13,059
Smite OST. Auto leaf blower and automatic leaf blower. What is that? Oh shit. This is where the

271
00:41:13,059 --> 00:41:22,820
game starts to play itself. Perfect. The little Roombas. Oh, that's so cute. I love them. Wait,

272
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:43,380
why are they out of batteries? Are you serious? Stardew Valley. How about Pokemon Mystery Dungeon?

273
00:41:43,380 --> 00:42:01,780
I'll do Earthbound for a little while. Who doesn't love the Earthbound OST? I want Toe Jam Eternal.

274
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:17,539
Just because I want to hear the... Yeah, there it is. Am I delayed by like fucking a thousand seconds?

275
00:42:17,539 --> 00:42:24,820
No.

276
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:38,710
Burp. Dude, I gotta tell you guys something. I watched my new favorite YouTube video.

277
00:42:39,429 --> 00:42:48,250
It's this guy. It's this guy, Badlands Chucks. You ever heard of Badlands Booker? I love this guy,

278
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:57,190
by the way. He slams like sodas. He usually competes in the Coney Island hot dog eating

279
00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:08,219
competition. I love this guy's channel. I love him. He gets like a bunch of sodas and Gatorades.

280
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:14,059
Yeah, enough talk. I love this guy. It's like a new favorite channel. He has a video

281
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:20,619
where he burps so fucking loud and so long it's almost like it's not even real.

282
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:34,710
It's been dubbed over, but it's not. You have to play that video. We will. Hold on. It's insane.

283
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:42,710
You would love that. I love this guy. He seems like a nice guy, too.

284
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:51,079
He like scream burps into the camera and it just kills me.

285
00:43:57,369 --> 00:44:07,460
But he has a bunch of world records for like eating and drinking and stuff. I'm on a Badlands

286
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:21,699
Chucks kick right now. I'll tell you. Play it. Hold on. It just comes out. I love it. It's just

287
00:44:21,699 --> 00:44:35,860
ridiculous. Longest and loudest burp video ever created. You better not because this channel is

288
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:52,630
perfect. Hold on. I'll get it. Show it. Show it. Hold on. I'm working on it. Disney Plus, Hulu,

289
00:44:52,630 --> 00:45:02,710
and ESPN. Don't listen to that. Some characters. The largest streaming TV library. Stop. I don't

290
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:12,199
want to hear it. Skip that ad. All right. We'll just get to the part. He's drinking a like a

291
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:24,500
two liter of soda. We'll get to the part where he does it. It's ridiculous. Can you see it?

292
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:32,780
This is the most ridiculous video I've ever seen. You guys ready? All right. Let's go. Three, two,

293
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:45,860
one. This is currently the best channel on YouTube, by the way. We're going to make that clear.

294
00:45:59,619 --> 00:46:09,139
It's so hard to do this. I think this is like an old video of his, too. Here it comes. Here it

295
00:46:09,139 --> 00:46:28,760
comes. Here it comes. I turn your volume down. I'm serious. I can't do it. It's so insane.

296
00:46:32,679 --> 00:46:43,050
Oh, it's the best. It's still going. Okay. All right. It's the best video on YouTube by far.

297
00:46:43,610 --> 00:47:04,940
It's Badlands Chugs. Go follow Badlands Chugs. Put it at half speed. Do that on stream? You serious?

298
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:17,449
No, these guys are like trained professionals. He has world records. I don't know. I can't do that.

299
00:47:17,449 --> 00:47:27,769
I don't have a world record. That's the sample from a dubstep. Oh, it's so loud and just so

300
00:47:27,769 --> 00:47:41,429
powerful. It really is like a it's like a war cry. I got 75 golds. There we go. You're dead

301
00:47:41,429 --> 00:48:04,889
as a world record. Yeah, I know. 80. All right. We got some we're upgrading to do here. Link.

302
00:48:04,889 --> 00:48:16,090
Look at this link. What link? No, no links right now. Look, look, look, look. Hold on. Wait,

303
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:21,190
wait, wait, wait, wait. I can't even click it. Pee your pants right now. No, I'm not going to

304
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:31,050
pee my pants right now. I'm busy. How about more trees and more fertilizer? Yeah. Yep.

305
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:55,909
Here's another one. No, let me get to like at least $100,000 and I'll click it. This one,

306
00:48:55,989 --> 00:49:01,269
please, please. Are you kidding me? You're useless. Well, I click the link. I click the link.

307
00:49:09,849 --> 00:49:23,110
No, no, thanks. That's not good enough. What do I owe? I still owe like just around $4 billion.

308
00:49:23,829 --> 00:49:27,269
That's got to be at least a 75% wipe. All right, that's not happening.

309
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:42,920
Haven't people already done that too? I know of at least like three or four like to at least two

310
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:50,650
or three streamers that have done exactly what you were describing. RT did that like very recently

311
00:49:50,650 --> 00:50:06,469
like a month or two ago. I love this game. He dated chat for free. Well, that's the difference

312
00:50:06,469 --> 00:50:11,659
between him and I. That's the difference between him and I. You're not going to get anything for

313
00:50:11,659 --> 00:50:28,309
free here. Everything has a cost. Everything has a cost. It's implying that you're good at it.

314
00:50:28,309 --> 00:50:41,500
What if you're good at something? Never do it. I need more leaves. This is not enough. I need

315
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:50,900
more leaves. Not enough. Nuclear fuel. No. Can I spend some of the gold leaves? How much? It's

316
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:55,829
500 for the next tool, right? Can I just save up for the next tool? No, no, no. I need more leaves.

317
00:50:55,829 --> 00:51:01,030
No, fuck that. Unlock the leaf portal. You can restart your leaf blowing to gain coins. What?

318
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:15,769
Is this prestiging? Spawns one more leaf per tree. Yeah, let's go. Look at that. It's filling the

319
00:51:15,769 --> 00:51:24,059
screen now. Remember, you idiot, the devs in the chat and you missed it. Were they?

320
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:37,219
Are they still here? Look at the chat. I didn't see. Where? Is it a bait? It might be. I don't

321
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:47,900
know. I don't know. It might be a bait. Behind you. I look behind me. Hey, man. Hey, what's up? Hey,

322
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:57,800
you playing my game? The thing is though, anybody could just say that. I could just be like a crazed

323
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:07,619
person. That could still be somebody pretending to be a dev. The whole dev in chat thing, we need

324
00:52:07,619 --> 00:52:17,320
some form of dev ID, don't we? Twitch should implement a feature where they have another badge.

325
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:21,079
If they're actually the game dev and they can prove it, when their game is being played from

326
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:26,119
the directory, they should pop up and chat with a dev badge. Why is that not here, Twitch? Why have

327
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:39,050
you not implemented that? Why is that not a thing you have here? You just put me in a clown costume.

328
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:43,130
I'll get in there to a Twitch meeting and I'll give them all these things. I want a percentage

329
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:57,460
though. It's not for free. It never was. And I make sure I say that in the boardroom. And then they

330
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:02,500
say, Mr. Albertson, you're not getting any, a fraction of any of these royalties. Okay, that's

331
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:06,900
fine. That's cool. Cool, man. That's cool. Hey, man. Just give me a call if I can do anything, okay?

332
00:53:08,309 --> 00:53:15,610
Just give me a call. I'll be around. You can use any of those. Just use them. You can use any of

333
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:21,110
them. All right, cool. Yep. See you. Thanks for having me. Thanks for having me. Yeah, call me

334
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:27,639
again if you need me for anything. If you just want to hang out. I'll be around. I don't live

335
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:33,510
here, but I could be here. I could be here. Just let me know. Then I'll honk the nose like three

336
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:52,010
times and they will never call me again. In fact, the door will lock behind me. The door will lock

337
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:58,630
behind me and then I will have forgotten something in the boardroom. And I have to stand there and I

338
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:06,519
have to text somebody that's still in there. Hey, I left my jacket in there. And then they all have

339
00:54:06,519 --> 00:54:12,860
to go, fuck, he's going to hear the door unlock sound. It's not just, oh, yeah, open. Here we are.

340
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:18,570
He's going to sit. He's right there and he's going to hear chunk chunk. And he's going to know that

341
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:35,909
we locked the fucking door. Grab my jacket. Toe Jamming Girl is a great soundtrack. I didn't even

342
00:54:35,909 --> 00:54:43,369
think about that. All right, I got money. Where's it going? Freeze. More of them. And a third auto

343
00:54:43,369 --> 00:55:03,340
leaf blower. Is this a Family Guy skit? I hope not. It is. No, it is not. It's not. That's not.

344
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:11,289
Not. You know, we're going to get to a real weird part of like human history here in the next couple

345
00:55:11,289 --> 00:55:16,940
hundred years when like every conceivable thing that's ever been said, every conceivable joke,

346
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:23,190
every piece of music, every combination of sounds have been done. What happens in like two or three

347
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:36,380
hundred years? It's never going to happen. Are you sure? I might. What happens when every possible

348
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:46,679
joke can be made and every possible song is written? Every movie's ever been made? How do

349
00:55:46,679 --> 00:55:54,460
we entertain ourselves? I think we're going back to the gladiator times when every piece of music

350
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:57,420
has ever been written and nothing else can be written again in like a thousand years. We're

351
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:13,579
going back into like we're going back to the gladiator pits. Just listen to old stuff. Yeah,

352
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:25,940
you could. Or you could watch the new like UFC card, UFC 1600, where they just give two guys

353
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:45,380
two rakes and and they add like lightsaber sounds over the footage, like live. And there'll be like

354
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:53,619
two or three ads for like fucking like the new Spongebob movie. That's what we're looking at.

355
00:56:53,619 --> 00:57:07,050
Jeremy, you always reuse jokes. We're used to it already. All right. Yeah, but I made them up.

356
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:12,409
But I made them up. I made them up. You know how difficult it was and how hard it was to sit there

357
00:57:12,409 --> 00:57:21,320
and have writers block and craft over and over again in my head? Well, what would that be? Like

358
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:25,320
it was there was so much thought that went into that. It was I had to sit there and write down

359
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:44,489
hundreds of pages of scripture. I need five hundred leaves. I need more. I need more. That's

360
00:57:44,489 --> 00:57:49,880
the I'm trying to yell, but I'm not trying to actually yell loud, like pretend yelling. I hate

361
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:58,329
that. I'm not doing that anymore. You'll never hear that again from me. I promise. Stop pretending.

362
00:57:58,329 --> 00:58:07,900
Look at how many leaves are on screen, though. You guys didn't like this game. How dare you?

363
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:17,639
More leaves, more. Prestige already. Should I, though? Leaf portal is 300. Um, gained coins.

364
00:58:17,639 --> 00:58:30,519
But what what do you mean coins? I don't know what that means. Is this the whole game? Um,

365
00:58:30,519 --> 00:58:34,780
for the most part, yeah, you just just chill and just blow leaves and stuff, man.

366
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:40,869
Well, this is going to be just a chill stream or just talk to you guys and hang out with you.

367
00:58:40,869 --> 00:58:44,070
Why don't you? I've asked you guys a bunch of questions. Why don't you ask me a few questions?

368
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:51,340
What do you think? Any questions for me? I will answer anything. Let's go. What do you have? Any

369
00:58:51,340 --> 00:59:00,070
questions? Old to you. Thirty five. Next one, please. What are the announcements? The announcements

370
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:11,429
of three different projects that are going to be shown and seen very soon. Two of them will be in

371
00:59:11,429 --> 00:59:19,320
the month of February. One of them will probably be in April or March or April. We'll see. Are you

372
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:36,230
the Zodiac Killer? I was not alive. So no, that's not an excuse. I knew I was. I'm sick of this one.

373
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:53,590
I need a new one. More trees or should I buy? Should I do it about a maple story? All right,

374
00:59:53,590 --> 01:00:04,059
sure. Let's do maple story. Maple story 2006, two hour compilation. Is this the one you're looking

375
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:22,139
for? All right. This is good. I'm going to buy more trees and more fertilizer. The same thing over

376
01:00:22,139 --> 01:00:31,460
here. I'll buy more nuclear fuel. I love when there's a million on the screen and you just go

377
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:47,559
like that. Is it Castlevania? Maple story. I've heard this before. Where have I heard this?

378
01:00:48,440 --> 01:01:05,860
Have I heard this somewhere? It's in maple story, but I feel like this sounds pretty

379
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:14,539
close to something else. It's toxic. No, it's not. I thought about that for a second, but it's not.

380
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:31,369
It is. It's not. All right. You guys don't think we're going to get to a point in like 100, 200

381
01:01:31,369 --> 01:01:36,010
years where every song has been written when already you're telling me that all songs are

382
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:43,940
toxic from Britney Spears? And that's now. Really? You don't think in like 500 years that you...

383
01:01:50,539 --> 01:01:59,860
There's infinite songs. Is there though? Yeah, that's what these scientists say about the

384
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:07,059
planets in the solar system, but I can only see a few hundred up there. I can only see maybe a

385
01:02:07,059 --> 01:02:29,420
few thousand up there. And they say there's quadrillions. I don't know. Yeah. Prove to me

386
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:36,699
that we don't live in a dome. Okay. You proved to me that we don't live in a dome. And I'll shut up.

387
01:02:36,699 --> 01:03:11,590
There are only eight planets in the solar system. Like go outside, dude. We're in a giant snow globe.

388
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:19,369
Just wait till somebody shakes us. Yeah. We're just an old snow globe in some alien's attic

389
01:03:19,369 --> 01:03:30,139
somewhere. And that old alien's going to like pass away. And so the old alien's like young

390
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:35,610
grandson is going to come up and go through the stuff in the attic and be like, what's this thing?

391
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:40,219
Flowing like a bunch of dust off it. And all of a sudden a huge amount of wind hits us.

392
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:48,199
Oh, beautiful. Gonna pick it up and shake it. And just, we're all going to turn to fucking liquid.

393
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:08,570
That was Men in Black. That's a really, that's a really great concept. Yeah. It's a really

394
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:22,889
interesting concept, isn't it? It's a good movie. Why are you playing this? Um, because I wanted to

395
01:04:22,889 --> 01:04:26,010
and it was something I wanted, it seemed like a fun game to chill and just talk and hang out.

396
01:04:26,889 --> 01:04:32,300
While I have, while I'm doing a bunch of stuff and doing a bunch of work and, you know, I'm working,

397
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:37,260
you know, I'm working, you know, got a lot of things going on, some projects that you've got.

398
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:41,800
Hopefully you'd be very excited about soon. I wanted to come and pop in and say hi for a little

399
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:49,880
while. This is some OSTs. To explain to you that there's only maybe 30 planets total in our entire

400
01:04:49,880 --> 01:05:06,090
galaxy and entire world. Just easy stuff like that, you know? Planets in the world. All right,

401
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:12,489
here we go. I'm going for it. Advanced leaf blower. Holy shit, this thing's a shotgun.

402
01:05:14,389 --> 01:05:27,829
It's so much better. Yep. Look at that. Should I prestige? Should I try it and see what it does?

403
01:05:28,469 --> 01:05:34,760
It's the same blower. Yeah, but it's bigger and stronger.

404
01:05:35,719 --> 01:05:48,380
Look how much more powerful it is. Don't do it yet. Does it matter how many apples I've collected

405
01:05:48,380 --> 01:06:07,110
too? It does. Okay. Chilling out while having existential crises. Is it crises or crises?

406
01:06:08,070 --> 01:06:18,820
Crises? Crises? How many? Multiple crises would be a crises. Crises. Sounds weird. Crises. It's

407
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:34,039
not like a crisis. It's not crises. Crises. Oh, I like this one. Crises is plural. Okay. Yeah,

408
01:06:34,039 --> 01:06:50,380
that's what I meant. Yeah, cool. I'm getting a lot more gold leaves. That's good. Maybe I should

409
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:57,099
stay at the bottom. No, that's not going to work. They don't go far enough. You're going to, oh god,

414
01:07:58,460 --> 01:08:14,170

428
01:10:56,390 --> 01:11:11,579
have any more. This is 34? 34 per leaf? I was doing four. Oh my God. Okay, this just sped up.

429
01:11:11,579 --> 01:11:20,039
Pay to win, apparently. Well, let's get some more trees. Oh, now we're heating up. This is

430
01:11:20,039 --> 01:11:33,960
going to heat up like crazy. I have 1.7 thousand? Leaf combo. Combo 50 times two. Max combo increase.

431
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:52,739
Holy shit. Plus 102. Don't heat up leaves. What do you guys think the first food that a caveman

432
01:11:52,819 --> 01:12:17,829
ate was? What do you think it was? Is it weird that I'm going to say other cavemen? But wait,

433
01:12:17,829 --> 01:12:24,090
no, that would imply that they have to get older. Okay, so hold on. Berries? It started eating stuff.

434
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:38,890
How do you know what hungry is? You just have this awful weird stomach feeling and it's like,

435
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:53,960
what's this? The first person to ever eat food. I didn't know what that meant. Who was the first

436
01:12:53,960 --> 01:13:28,340
person? Who was the first person? Bible logic. Who was the first person? Well, it was Carl the caveman.

437
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:32,890
He decided that today was the day he was going to eat. He's going to chew with his teeth

438
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:47,479
everything he could find. Carl the caveman died very shortly after this, but Cindy the cavewoman

439
01:13:48,539 --> 01:13:55,289
watched what Carl the caveman ate and noticed that he stopped moving after eating this particular

440
01:13:55,289 --> 01:14:01,880
rock. So she was like, I'm not going to eat that one. Not going to crunch up that one. So she

441
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:09,130
started to eat just random shit until she died. And then Steve, caveman Steve came by and realized

442
01:14:09,130 --> 01:14:16,630
that cavewoman Cindy ate a branch that he's not going to eat. And he also knows that caveman Carl

443
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:21,770
consumed a couple of rocks that were, that made him stop moving. And eventually it got to a point

444
01:14:21,770 --> 01:14:42,630
where they figured it out. Evolution pretty much. God, can you imagine, can you possibly imagine

445
01:14:42,630 --> 01:14:53,829
needing to just take a guess? Like, can I even eat this? Like guys, I look at the back of like

446
01:14:53,829 --> 01:14:58,869
a fucking almond milk and if it's like close to like its best buy date, I go, I'm not sure about

447
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:06,119
this. I'm not sure about this. These, these people had to fucking eat just random stuff until they

448
01:15:06,119 --> 01:15:32,500
died. And then other people just like, what? We've got it really good. He's like caveman

449
01:15:35,369 --> 01:15:49,720
caveman Andy. And the worst part about this is it's like really think about that. Like water,

450
01:15:50,619 --> 01:15:57,289
water is essential to live and it's essential to life. But back like hundreds of thousands or

451
01:15:57,289 --> 01:16:01,930
millions or whatever, whatever it is. Even water could have been dangerous. You know,

452
01:16:02,489 --> 01:16:06,890
it's like why did he die after drinking that water? We drink water. We drink this liquid.

453
01:16:07,689 --> 01:16:14,789
Some water cannot be drank and consumed. How the, what? How do we keep track of this? That water

454
01:16:14,789 --> 01:16:19,750
has like fucking bacteria in it. It like killed him. That water is like salt and it's bad. How

455
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:37,369
did they keep track of this? It had to have been some big giant caveman notebook that you went to

456
01:16:37,369 --> 01:16:40,810
before you went up to go eat food. And you just kind of looked at it and been like, okay,

457
01:16:40,810 --> 01:16:56,500
green rock bad, red, red, orange rock. Good. Red berry bad. And that person has a huge list

458
01:16:56,500 --> 01:17:05,640
and that's something that you have to borrow. You do, you can't remember all that. Why are

459
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:26,229
they eating rocks? To find out how do animals live? Animals like just eat, but they had to do that too.

460
01:17:26,229 --> 01:17:49,899
I need more combos. Yeah, I do. Poop diary. A large green bean, poop red. Stay away from green,

461
01:17:49,899 --> 01:18:09,260
large green bean. Somebody had to keep track of this. Yeah. All of your history books that you

462
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:17,579
read in class are just the evolution of the don't eat the bread rock book. That's the first thing

463
01:18:17,579 --> 01:18:37,109
they had to write down. Ooh, nice. What about bread? They didn't figure that out for like a

464
01:18:37,109 --> 01:18:56,310
thousand years. He's doing crack rocks. A thousand from what? I don't know. I don't know anything.

465
01:18:56,310 --> 01:19:04,100
You know, as much as I do, as there is a part of our human history that we have no idea what the

466
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:11,689
fuck happened. Cause I have a blurry black and white picture of like my great, great grandfather

467
01:19:11,689 --> 01:19:31,000
with a top hat on. I don't know what he ate. We don't have, what do we have for barometer? Bro

468
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:39,109
history. We know what they, yeah, we know what our like great, great, great grandparents looked like

469
01:19:39,750 --> 01:20:03,510
but what about their great, great, great, great grandparents? Wild stuff, man. This dude is

470
01:20:03,510 --> 01:20:16,859
absolutely zonked right now. All right. I'm going to buy some stuff. More marketing. Should I,

471
01:20:16,859 --> 01:20:25,640
should I prestige? I feel like I kind of should. Combo duration longer. Combo multiplier. Holy shit.

472
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:37,060
This is going to be crazy. Hold on. Nice. Get a new leaf blower. I could. It's 5k. All right. I'll

473
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:55,960
get the new, uh, stop hogging the bong. Well, we can't have, we can't have like, listen to this music.

474
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:02,149
I'm sitting here just blowing leaves and we're listening to like Zen music. We can't have a

475
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:32,300
conversation like this. Highest stream 2021. New category. You guys are going to be like just on

476
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:41,210
the lookout. You guys are going to be like on the frowl just on every stream. No, that this is, but

477
01:21:41,210 --> 01:21:56,340
okay. Fine. Add it. That's funny. All right. Fine. Fine. Fine. You can have it blowing leaves and

478
01:21:56,340 --> 01:22:05,239
talking about like what caveman eight and how they recorded history. Yeah. I get, yeah. I guess

479
01:22:05,239 --> 01:22:20,390
that is a, that is a, yeah. You're literally blowing the leaves wrong. What? How would you,

480
01:22:20,390 --> 01:22:30,010
how should I do it? How did they learn mate? I don't know. I didn't know that they had bones

481
01:22:30,010 --> 01:22:34,819
in their body. They didn't know what they, like you, how did they even? All right. I'm not, let's

482
01:22:34,819 --> 01:22:45,140
go. This is not going to be highest stream 2021. They did. Yeah. But, but they didn't get it. They

483
01:22:45,140 --> 01:23:02,789
just knew that they had like stuff in their arms. Let it pile up. All right. Fine. I was language

484
01:23:02,789 --> 01:23:19,609
made. What the fuck? I know. What the fuck? I get a new lawyer. Nuclear leaf blower. You need to

485
01:23:19,609 --> 01:23:28,840
take care not to blow away your house with this. Oh yeah. That's a good one right there. Oh yeah.

486
01:23:31,829 --> 01:23:46,810
This feels good. Yep. Oh, that's perfect. I'm going to let it pile up and then I'm going to blow it.

487
01:23:46,810 --> 01:24:05,380
Perfect. Watching the stream drunk today was a bad idea. Why? Oh, let's wait. I'm not going

488
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:09,060
to do it till it's a ton. Stop, stop, stop, stop. You're ruining everything. Get out of here.

489
01:24:09,699 --> 01:24:17,029
That's like the dog just did that. You, you scraped up the leaves. You got a nice pile.

490
01:24:17,029 --> 01:24:20,710
Like the dog just ran out and was like, I'm going to go like that. It just runs through and you're

491
01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:35,300
like, no. The dog got to have fun before you did. That was fucking fantastic by the way. That felt

492
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:49,739
great. What do you think? Should I prestige? Is it time? I got max trees. Should I get to max

493
01:24:49,739 --> 01:25:08,439
everything and then prestige? Prestige now. Do it. Leaf portal coming up. Platinum leaves.

494
01:25:16,550 --> 01:25:25,670
I got platinum leaves. No, don't do it. Should I not have done that? Sorry. I got 20. Max everything

495
01:25:25,670 --> 01:25:43,670
first. I just added a ton more. All right. I added so many more trees. You've ruined it. No, I didn't.

496
01:25:45,189 --> 01:25:55,060
Chat's omega stupid. Oh, bismuth leaves. Trees can drop bismuth leaves. Dude. All right. This is

497
01:25:55,060 --> 01:26:01,380
pretty cool. Can you switch to streaming on YouTube so you can, you can watch on your Nintendo switch?

498
01:26:03,340 --> 01:26:17,590
Um, I'm sorry. No. Just open up a stream on YouTube so this one guy can get to watch on

499
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:31,859
this switch while he takes a dump. Ah, that felt good. One million. Guys, I don't even know how to

500
01:26:31,859 --> 01:26:38,970
stream on YouTube playing this. All right. I think I'm going to prestige. I'm going to go for it.

501
01:26:38,970 --> 01:26:46,340
Let's go. Yeah. It's time. It's time to prestige. Let's go. Unlock the leaf portal. I bought it.

502
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:56,140
Enter the leaf portal to restart your blowing adventure with some coins. 20 plus coins have

503
01:26:56,140 --> 01:27:01,460
recommended at first prestige. I have 522 coins. All right. Hold on. No, no, not yet. I have the

504
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:19,239
counter going. Sorry, one guy. I guess he fucking hates you. 55. Yeah. Well, I want like a thousand

505
01:27:19,239 --> 01:27:29,880
coins on my first prestige. God, this OST is so based. Is it? That's the first time I think I've

506
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:39,939
ever heard it. I felt good. All right. Make sure to do some more upgrades. I'm going to lose it on

507
01:27:39,939 --> 01:27:56,300
a prestige, right? I might as well just get as much as I can out of this. Based. Based on what,

508
01:27:56,300 --> 01:28:09,510
Jeremiah? I don't, that's, I know that you're making that joke. You bought the upgrade. Well,

509
01:28:09,510 --> 01:28:14,890
I have to activate the upgrade. Okay. We can get so many more coins. Look at the percentage just

510
01:28:14,890 --> 01:28:27,460
ticking up like crazy. I'm going to wait till this is like a thousand. Buy more multiplier.

511
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:36,329
Nuclear max combo and multiplier. All right. We got a higher max combo and then we're going

512
01:28:36,329 --> 01:28:51,899
to do multiplier. Bang. Oh, I don't know what that was. I'm sorry. You need to, you need to

513
01:28:51,899 --> 01:28:55,850
prestige to get to platinum leaf. So you have to keep that in mind. Okay. All right. But I just,

514
01:28:55,850 --> 01:29:00,069
I look at the, look at these coins just ticking the fuck up like crazy. I'm not done yet. I want

515
01:29:00,069 --> 01:29:07,260
those out. I don't know a lot. What do the coins even do? I don't know, but I want them. I don't

516
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:22,039
even know what they do. I don't even care what they do. I just want a ton of them. This is what

517
01:29:22,039 --> 01:29:35,140
it's like having a lawn. Uh, yeah. Pretty much, pretty much this was, is this a act two Diablo

518
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:51,590
2? It sounds like that. I love the act two music. Let's go a little more. Uh, I want a higher

519
01:29:51,590 --> 01:30:08,840
multiplier and I want max out the fertilizer and nuclear fuel, but on Naruto just whip the mouse

520
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:13,239
around. No, I don't like that. I don't like that. That hurts my head. I just, I'd like to cleanly

521
01:30:13,239 --> 01:30:21,079
go through clean lines like that. It's a little slower, but it feels much nicer on the front of

522
01:30:21,079 --> 01:30:33,399
the brain there. It feels so much better. Yeah. Nuclear, nuclear. You know why it's hard? I usually

523
01:30:33,399 --> 01:30:53,369
say nuclear. Sometimes like nuclear, nuclear. Sometimes it's fun to say nuclear. Are you eating

524
01:30:53,369 --> 01:31:05,449
the leaves? Um, I think it's just spraying them off to the side. I get more room. No. Okay. I think

525
01:31:05,449 --> 01:31:23,510
it's time. How are we looking? When that gets to a thousand, I'll do it. When that hits a thousand,

526
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:43,770
I'll go. A Hollow Knight? Uh, no, probably not. Sorry. I'm sorry. What's the OST? This is Maple

527
01:31:43,770 --> 01:31:53,750
Story 2006 GMS edition. I'm not sure what that means, but that's what it is. Like Dawn of War.

528
01:31:53,750 --> 01:32:08,710
You mean the good one? Dawn of War 1? Warhammer 40k Dawn of War? The good one? That might be fun.

529
01:32:08,710 --> 01:32:19,020
That's like my favorite RTS ever. Dawn of War 2 was good. I'm sorry. I'm going to have to disagree.

530
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:25,460
I like, uh, I like a lot of units. I like base building. I like the map. I like, no, I don't,

531
01:32:25,460 --> 01:32:30,180
I didn't like Dawn of War 2. I actually didn't like it at all. I'm sorry, guys. I know a lot of

532
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:34,260
some people might be really happy about it, but because we got Dawn of War 2, that's why we got

533
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:40,699
Dawn of War 3 the way we did. Keep that in mind. Dawn of War 2's existence is the reason why Dawn

534
01:32:40,699 --> 01:32:54,659
of War 3 was what the game it became. No, it isn't. Yeah, it is because they got rid of all the

535
01:32:54,659 --> 01:33:00,630
stuff from Dawn of War 1 and they made Dawn of War 2 about more about, um, like commanding a squad

536
01:33:00,630 --> 01:33:05,460
and less about like building a base and having like a bunch of units. And then they were like,

537
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:09,670
well, what the fuck did we do with Dawn of War 3 now? I don't know. Let's make Dawn of War 2 again,

538
01:33:09,670 --> 01:33:30,710
but this time worse. Dawn of War 2 campaign is fun, but everything else sucks. I could,

539
01:33:30,710 --> 01:33:36,739
yeah, I could imagine this probably the case. They have such cool characters too.

540
01:33:36,819 --> 01:33:46,170
They, um, the orcs. I love the orcs. It's such an interesting, uh, it's an interesting group.

541
01:33:46,170 --> 01:33:58,279
What's the boss? The big boss, right? What's his name? Big boss. Big. What's his name? Big boss.

542
01:33:58,279 --> 01:34:13,020
Gorgots here is Gorgots. I'm the boss. I'm big boss Gorgots. I love Gorgots. Now, the cool part

543
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:17,800
about the orcs was you just had to have a ton of them. The more that you had, the more population

544
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:38,760
like the better you did, right? Oh, that's a great game. It's too bad. Too bad. Pepe face.

545
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:48,340
Are we good for coins? Oh, we're, all right, here we go. We're ready to prestige in a minute

546
01:34:48,340 --> 01:35:02,100
because look at the, look at the counter. All right, I did it. Let's go. Why does it feel like

547
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:14,630
it's zoomed in? Is it zoomed in? Daily reward. Oh, sick. Offline. Leaves spawn to each interval.

548
01:35:14,630 --> 01:35:22,979
10 leaves. Time played. Blowing power. Player HP. Why is there HP? Did I just spoil something?

549
01:35:22,979 --> 01:35:41,399
You can, Santa. Angel for supporters only. Wait, I can be an auto blower? Leaf cape? Free? Afro?

550
01:35:42,310 --> 01:35:51,899
Rainbow? Robot? Alternate garden gnome? I have enough to buy one of these. Hitman? Grandpa? Gray,

551
01:35:51,899 --> 01:36:03,529
green, orange, pink, purple, red, turquoise, white, a bee. Oh my goodness.

552
01:36:10,460 --> 01:36:14,840
Wait, I need to see the other ones too. Let me see what the other ones are. Bird?

553
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:25,670
You could just be a leaf blower. It kind of looks like a, like a astronaut or something.

554
01:36:25,670 --> 01:36:35,529
Ace of spades? Fruit? Printer? Why would you be a printer? Auto blower? Dangerously funny.

555
01:36:35,770 --> 01:36:52,409
A cookie? Printer? Go burr. All right, I think I want to be the bee. I like the bee. Or the bird.

556
01:36:52,409 --> 01:37:07,859
I'll be the bee. Okay, so I now, gold leaves, a shitload of trees, a bunch of fertilizer,

557
01:37:07,859 --> 01:37:17,770
and a couple more trees. Let's go. Now I can get platinum leaves, you said, right?

558
01:37:17,770 --> 01:37:29,989
It's the funniest movie of the year. Why are you saying that? Spend the coins. Wait, purchase

559
01:37:29,989 --> 01:37:34,069
upgrades persist after stepping into the leaf portal. Indeed, travel to faraway places and

560
01:37:34,069 --> 01:37:42,710
discover new leaves. Unlock areas? Unlock printer. Leaf print machines print and collect leaves

561
01:37:42,710 --> 01:37:50,100
automatically. Hide it from the tax authorities. How many coins do I have? Not a ritual, but a

562
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:57,979
really fancy and useful machine. Unlock converters. Trees upgrades will be purchased automatically.

563
01:37:57,979 --> 01:38:07,539
Auto buy LBs. Okay, well, first of all, I got to buy the new area. Unlock the auto printers.

564
01:38:07,539 --> 01:38:14,649
Leaf print machines. Converters? Converters? Oh my God, I have so many more menus.

565
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:25,289
Uh, add a printer. Plus one printed leaf per level for all printers. Increases printer leaves

566
01:38:25,289 --> 01:38:36,090
by a hundred percent. Um, okay, let's auto printer two and buy it. I don't know. I don't know.

567
01:38:36,090 --> 01:38:47,619
Okay, I'm good. Now wait, hold on. Home garden. Neighbor's garden. This is your neighbor's garden.

568
01:38:47,619 --> 01:38:51,859
They wonder why there are so many leaves around so recently. And another one too. I can buy this one.

569
01:38:51,859 --> 01:39:07,560
Mountain. Which way should I go? Should I go to the neighbor's house? Whoa. I go to the mountain?

570
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:19,479
Bold converter. Converts a hundred leaves to one gold leaf. Start. Per second? Converts a hundred

571
01:39:19,479 --> 01:39:29,829
gold to one platinum. Per second. Okay, um, I'm gonna keep this one turned on. Converter batch

572
01:39:29,829 --> 01:39:36,810
enabled. Start them all. Okay, hold on. We'll keep that one running. Printer shop. Printers print

573
01:39:36,810 --> 01:39:51,420
leaves every second. Prints and collects 39 basic leaves a second per level. So I'm printing 78

574
01:39:51,420 --> 01:40:02,970
leaves a second. Print plow. So what's that? What's that? What's that? What is this? What do I do

575
01:40:02,970 --> 01:40:07,430
about this? There's a bird in the lawn. How do I, what do I do? Do I collect it? Do I spray it?

576
01:40:07,430 --> 01:40:31,909
Kill it. I don't have any weapons. What do I do? Okay, um, I have no more coins. You have to blow

577
01:40:31,909 --> 01:40:38,010
leaves into it. Oh shit, really? All right, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Platinum. Spawns more

578
01:40:38,010 --> 01:40:47,079
trees. All right, I'm gonna, I got two platinum trees now. I got 27,000. Let's get some more

579
01:40:47,079 --> 01:40:55,539
trees in here. Marketing. Get some auto lowers, auto blowers. There we go. Let's, yeah, let's

580
01:40:55,539 --> 01:41:03,850
kick it up a notch as Emeril used to say. Go to the mountain? Um, everyone in the mountain is

581
01:41:03,850 --> 01:41:20,699
annoyed by leaves. I can't hit him. My, that's too powerful. He's too powerful. I need more leaves.

582
01:41:20,699 --> 01:41:34,279
There's not enough to hit him. My blower's too powerful. Oh shit, I didn't get it. Oh my god,

583
01:41:34,279 --> 01:41:44,500
that's huge. Come on, come on, come on, come on. I need more leaves. More. I need more. By maximum.

584
01:41:44,500 --> 01:42:00,039
That's okay. Wait, wait, I have a, I have a lot of gold, right? Gold trees. Gold fertilizer. Trees,

585
01:42:00,039 --> 01:42:04,100
trees. More, more, more, more, more. Good, good, good, good, good, good, good. Oh, I'm fucking

586
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:19,989
excited. You're bad at this game? You can't be bad at an idle game. Addicted. He's addicted.

587
01:42:19,989 --> 01:42:40,460
Come on, spawn leaves again. Damn it. Equip your hands? That doesn't do anything. What about a

588
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:54,439
rake? Oh shit, there's another one. I almost hit it. 63,000? I have 600. Hold on. I need more

589
01:42:54,439 --> 01:43:07,029
trees. I wonder what you get for, like, killing a deer. Do the neighbor's yard, it's easier?

590
01:43:07,510 --> 01:43:17,060
I think I'm already invested here. I want the other leaves. Heal. Heal? Why are you guys saying

591
01:43:17,060 --> 01:43:29,020
heal? Click on this. Sing toxic by Britney Spears for a billion off the debt. I'm not sure that's,

592
01:43:29,020 --> 01:43:40,260
I don't know if you guys are going to agree to that one. I doubt that's actually what you guys

593
01:43:40,260 --> 01:43:51,479
are going to do. So I still have the gold converter going. I'm just going to keep that on. 101 gold.

594
01:43:51,479 --> 01:43:55,079
I have some, I need more platinum leaves. Leaf combo. There it is. Let's go. Come on.

595
01:43:55,079 --> 01:44:08,359
Max combo. Come on. What the fuck do you think this is? Bunnies have a lot of health. Start

596
01:44:08,359 --> 01:44:18,949
platinum converter. Should I? It's a hundred. It's a hundred per one. I'm not, I don't,

597
01:44:18,949 --> 01:44:27,239
no, I don't think so. I'm going to burn through that. Not yet. By the normal upgrades too. Yeah,

598
01:44:27,239 --> 01:44:38,869
yeah, yeah. That's right. Deal, deal, deal. No, no deal. I was so insulted by that initial offer

599
01:44:38,869 --> 01:44:51,850
that I just walked away from the table. Prestige again? I could just buy the portal just to have

600
01:44:51,850 --> 01:45:02,789
it. I have 171 right now. No, I'm not prestige until I have at least like 5k. Look at the snowman.

601
01:45:08,390 --> 01:45:20,170
You played these shitty games to spite your viewers? You think this is a shitty game? I don't

602
01:45:20,170 --> 01:45:28,550
think that. Of course, of course it's to spite them. Every time I see the word bald in chat,

603
01:45:28,550 --> 01:45:32,060
I just add another 30 seconds to when I'm going to play one of these games.

604
01:45:32,060 --> 01:45:51,750
Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it. Oh, this is a good song.

605
01:45:51,750 --> 01:46:00,260
All right. I got a lot. Let's spend some money. More trees, more leaves, more nuclear fuel. And

606
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:10,939
then let's do, I need to unlock platinum leaves. 10k. I'm almost there. Let's get upgrades. There

607
01:46:10,939 --> 01:46:22,600
we go. Nice. Get combos. I will. That's the next thing I'm going to work on. 10k, Andy.

608
01:46:26,630 --> 01:46:40,180
A little more than 10k here right now. Here's what we're going to do. You ready?

609
01:46:40,180 --> 01:46:44,810
I'm going to pause this. I'm going to go take a pee break. We're going to come back. We're going

610
01:46:44,810 --> 01:46:49,289
to do the germa census and then I'm going to continue to play this game. How's that sound?

611
01:46:49,289 --> 01:52:58,180
You ready for a little break? Sounds good to me. I'll be right back. Oh, we're going cheesy.

612
01:53:08,659 --> 01:53:13,899
All right. Let's keep going. First thing that somebody writes, whatever it is,

613
01:53:13,899 --> 01:53:23,939
it's edible. I'll eat it for dinner. Pizza. All right. Cool. Thanks for the help.

614
01:53:28,170 --> 01:53:51,109
Maybe it should be a hamburger. That's boring. So what? So what? Let's go. Oh,

615
01:53:51,109 --> 01:54:03,270
I just got 1.2k platinum leaves. Holy shit. All right. Hold on. I can unlock

616
01:54:03,270 --> 01:54:09,239
bismuth leaves. More trees with these. I don't know. It's probably a mistake. Whatever.

617
01:54:17,859 --> 01:54:23,659
Census. Oh, oopsie. All right. Here comes the, yeah, let's do the census.

618
01:54:23,659 --> 01:54:33,579
I'm going to turn this down. So this is an interesting set of images that we're going

619
01:54:33,579 --> 01:54:49,909
to look at. Here's the 2020. This is very elaborate, by the way. Out of 1,985 respondents,

620
01:54:49,909 --> 01:54:54,710
I was there. If you were one of them, this is so old. This is very old. This is from like

621
01:54:54,710 --> 01:55:00,949
May of last year. Let's make that really clear. But a shitload of you probably have not seen

622
01:55:00,949 --> 01:55:07,020
this before, so I was going to go over it. So how long have you been, out of almost 2,000 people

623
01:55:07,020 --> 01:55:12,619
that responded, and took the whole thing, how long have you been watching the channel?

624
01:55:14,180 --> 01:55:25,239
Some of you, as of last year, 15.2% less than one year. 30% of one to four years. The most

625
01:55:25,239 --> 01:55:32,010
surprising thing for me here is that 54% of you, more than half of the entire channel,

626
01:55:32,010 --> 01:55:43,670
has been here for five plus years. That's pretty surprising. 2012 gang. They're lying.

627
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:50,619
Now, you had to prove it. You had to prove when you made your first YouTube comment.

628
01:55:50,619 --> 01:56:03,619
So I'm sorry. A lot went into this. Easy. 50% have been following German for five years,

629
01:56:03,619 --> 01:56:10,039
yet 50% also say the most recent ARC is their favorite. The recent ARC is the favorite.

630
01:56:10,039 --> 01:56:17,500
And we can look at that right here. Favorite ARC. TF Tuber ARC, Boston ARC, and then Vegas ARC.

631
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:29,579
Half of you think that. Interesting stuff. All right, the one guy experience. What do you watch?

632
01:56:29,579 --> 01:56:36,170
Jerma's stream, Jerma's second, or both? Those of you that ask why I have the second channel in the

633
01:56:36,170 --> 01:56:44,569
first place, it's because look at the amount of people that do not watch a stream. Ever.

634
01:56:44,569 --> 01:56:52,619
You got 36% of every single one of you. Maybe. That's the thing with sample sizes, you know,

635
01:56:52,619 --> 01:57:01,579
maybe. That's why the second channel is trying to, you know, put some time and effort into it,

636
01:57:01,579 --> 01:57:08,760
right? Because more than a third of you just don't watch the stream. In fact, I'm talking to

637
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:14,710
people that might see this on YouTube. So to the YouTube crowd, we love you. Thanks for watching.

638
01:57:14,710 --> 01:57:26,310
Wherever you watch. Have you ever shown Jerma to your friends? Yes, and they liked him. Okay.

639
01:57:27,109 --> 01:57:37,880
No, you haven't. And yes, and they thought he was weird. That's pretty high. Yes, they thought he

640
01:57:37,880 --> 01:57:48,020
was weird. Oh, and Jerma Pluto in the chat. Up here. By the way, it's only a 2.24% margin of error.

641
01:57:48,020 --> 01:57:53,189
By the way, you see who made this, Krosky. This is the one who put this together.

642
01:57:53,189 --> 01:58:01,220
Of our resident mods. How often do you watch the stream? Every single stream is only 12% of you

643
01:58:01,220 --> 01:58:09,189
guys. Several streams a week, several streams a month. Well, let me be fair. Sometimes I only

644
01:58:09,189 --> 01:58:22,420
stream several times a month. Sometimes you only get like two or three streams a week. But besides

645
01:58:22,420 --> 01:58:29,529
that, every stream. Well, the highest percentage is the several streams a week. That's my fault.

646
01:58:31,289 --> 01:58:40,020
12% are lying. And then only, look at this one though. Look at the purple one. Only the Jerma

647
01:58:40,020 --> 01:58:44,979
second and only the main channel. 20%. That's bigger than all the other ones. Besides the

648
01:58:44,979 --> 01:58:51,939
several times a week. Several times a month. That's a huge percentage of you guys. The 1.4%

649
01:58:51,939 --> 01:58:56,970
statistics shown below could be possible, could be people who possibly do not exist due to the

650
01:58:56,970 --> 01:59:10,470
margin of error. Do you watch Jerma alone or in a group? Alone. In a group or sometimes both.

651
01:59:10,470 --> 01:59:25,130
69.9%. We don't exist. Oh no. Very cool stuff. Very cool stuff indeed. There's more. You thought

652
01:59:25,130 --> 01:59:30,920
there was just one little limit. Let's keep going. What kind of psycho watches Jerma985? Let's find

653
01:59:30,920 --> 01:59:39,109
out. I asked in 2016, I wrote, how many women do we have in this chat? I'm curious. We'll find out.

654
01:59:39,109 --> 01:59:48,460
79% male, 10.4% female. Look, I just was, I was curious. I was just curious. I was not,

655
01:59:48,460 --> 02:00:04,949
what do you want me to say? 7.8% non-binary and then 2.8% other. I just wanted to, I just asked,

656
02:00:04,949 --> 02:00:20,359
okay? I just had to ask the question. It was 2016. I just was like, I was just barely live on Twitch.

657
02:00:20,359 --> 02:00:25,510
I was just barely live like every other day. I was like, I'm curious. Because we didn't have

658
02:00:25,510 --> 02:00:34,180
those statistics on Twitch. And then from there, so 79% male audience. How old are you though?

659
02:00:34,260 --> 02:00:41,159
This is why I can tell you guys. He said we're 12. Are you though? 18 to 24 is the largest demographic

660
02:00:41,159 --> 02:00:57,220
here. 73.5% of you guys are, I would, in the 18 to 24 range. Not 12. 17 or younger is 14.6%. You're

661
02:00:57,220 --> 02:01:01,899
not supposed to be watching this stream. You're, you need, you're not supposed to be here right now.

662
02:01:01,899 --> 02:01:17,460
What's an R rated movie in the United States? 17? Well, okay. And them. And then the 25 to 34

663
02:01:17,460 --> 02:01:26,710
is 10.7%. There are a pretty significant amount of people that are older. 35 plus is 1.2%. That's

664
02:01:26,710 --> 02:01:38,979
where I sit. Yep. A whopping 0.2% said they were a rat while one guy said they were Jerma. I didn't

665
02:01:38,979 --> 02:01:49,029
take this by the way. Here we go. We got kind of the world here. Those of you that always say,

666
02:01:49,029 --> 02:01:55,960
Jerma, how come you stream so late European? Jerma, it's like, it's two o'clock in the morning EU.

667
02:01:55,960 --> 02:02:01,989
Why do you do this to us? It's because almost 67% of the entire audience is based in the United

668
02:02:01,989 --> 02:02:10,069
States, North America. EU still takes up a significant chunk of 23%. But, you know, I got

669
02:02:10,069 --> 02:02:19,399
almost a 70% group of you guys that are in North America. And I'm in North America. And then after

670
02:02:19,399 --> 02:02:29,960
EU and NA, it really shrinks down a lot, doesn't it? Asia at 2.1%. Oceanic, 4.2%. The next one. But

671
02:02:30,039 --> 02:02:38,979
after EU, Oceanic. Interesting. And Antarctica. Almost 1% of you guys live in Antarctica?

672
02:02:38,979 --> 02:02:52,659
That seems like a lot. Margin of error. I'm the biggest streamer in Antarctica. I guarantee it.

673
02:02:52,659 --> 02:03:08,220
And then 0.3% Africa. Interesting. South America is up there with 2.7%. Very cool. Very cool.

674
02:03:08,779 --> 02:03:16,619
Highest level of education. Here we go. How many fucking doctors we got here? Let's see.

675
02:03:16,619 --> 02:03:25,369
Highest level of education. None. 1.8%. Middle school. 6.5%. High school or GED equivalent.

676
02:03:25,369 --> 02:03:39,880
56%. Okay. That's good. Look at this one. We got college degrees. 10% associates. 16.7% bachelors.

677
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:48,729
2.2% master's degrees. 5% of you guys have doctorates. That's a huge amount of people

678
02:03:48,729 --> 02:03:57,399
that have doctorates in this channel. Oh, sorry. It's 1.2%. 5.3% of you guys are other,

679
02:03:57,399 --> 02:04:04,069
which means it's even higher than doctorate. You're a PhD or something. So we got 10. 26.

680
02:04:04,069 --> 02:04:15,659
Like 27. 28. 29. Like 35% of you guys have doctorates. Rough estimate of annual income.

681
02:04:15,659 --> 02:04:28,470
Okay. Here we go. $0 to $99 is 30%. $1,000 to $9,909 is 14.5%. 10 to $24,000 is 12.9%.

682
02:04:29,109 --> 02:04:40,859
$25,000 to $49,000 is 7.3%. $50,000 to $100,000 is 3.6%. And then 1.8% of you guys have $100,000

683
02:04:40,859 --> 02:04:48,789
a year in income and then 30% of you don't know. Looking at this list here, you don't have to give

684
02:04:48,789 --> 02:05:01,510
me any fucking money. You understand? It's part of the reason why saying like, only pay me money if

685
02:05:01,510 --> 02:05:07,640
you really are able to and you take care of yourself and your entire life first. You don't

686
02:05:07,640 --> 02:05:13,289
have to pay me anything if you don't want to. Ever. Don't ever. Here we go again with this,

687
02:05:13,289 --> 02:05:20,819
but I got data. I've got data here that you can look at now. 1.8% $100,000 plus a year

688
02:05:20,819 --> 02:05:31,819
is those doctors. But seriously though, you don't have to pay me any fucking money.

689
02:05:31,819 --> 02:05:40,779
You got data now. You thought that was it? Not even close. Here we go.

690
02:05:42,619 --> 02:05:47,100
What are the top five best emotes on the channel as picked by the census?

691
02:05:49,590 --> 02:05:57,340
Thanks catgirlheadpat for five community subs. 11.4% said fireman's their favorite.

692
02:05:57,340 --> 02:06:04,180
And that's very close between the German Pluto and German Venus.

693
02:06:04,180 --> 02:06:08,779
And then the German Defoe is up there over the rat, which is surprising.

694
02:06:08,779 --> 02:06:17,819
I don't know how that's possible. And here we go. Here we go. You want to see how powerful you guys

695
02:06:17,819 --> 02:06:28,100
are? Do you hang out in the pre-stream chat or post-stream chat? Pre-stream chat, for those of

696
02:06:28,100 --> 02:06:33,899
you that don't have any idea, is the time before a stream starts. I don't know why I have to explain

697
02:06:33,899 --> 02:06:44,579
that. Why am I explaining that? You should get that. Everybody gets that. Almost 25% of you guys

698
02:06:44,579 --> 02:06:52,899
hang out in the pre-stream chat, which is where a ton of decisions are made. I would say 40% of all

699
02:06:52,899 --> 02:06:59,210
stream decisions are made in the pre-stream chat. That's pretty accurate for those of you pre-stream

700
02:06:59,210 --> 02:07:07,109
chatters. I think that's pretty accurate. Don't tell them what? Wait, what happened? Don't tell

701
02:07:07,109 --> 02:07:17,989
them. Don't advertise pre-stream. Oh, all right. Yeah. I thought you were talking about me. Both,

702
02:07:18,979 --> 02:07:25,670
which is interesting. So 11% plus 24 is like 30 to 40% of you guys that are making very,

703
02:07:25,670 --> 02:07:33,100
very strong decisions for the rest of us. Neither though. So 60% of you guys just kind of,

704
02:07:33,100 --> 02:07:42,699
yeah, that's fine too. That's good. Who else do you also watch? Yep. It's like this is funny

705
02:07:42,699 --> 02:07:51,699
because this is like, I can tell you this is the my list. Vinny at 58.2%, Joel at 51%,

706
02:07:51,699 --> 02:08:03,689
Stir at 39%, Kraikin, Italics, James, which is UberHacks on Uber, Tomato and Kiwo. I could see

707
02:08:03,689 --> 02:08:16,500
that. I would tell you like all these channels here are absolutely worth watching. More than

708
02:08:16,500 --> 02:08:26,630
half of you guys are Vinesauce crew, which I mean, these guys have done so much for this channel over

709
02:08:26,630 --> 02:08:34,170
the last couple of years. That's not surprising at all. Yeah. Cheers to Vinny and Joel, obviously,

710
02:08:34,170 --> 02:08:40,250
for an incredible amount of support and attention I've gotten from like the Vinesauce community

711
02:08:40,250 --> 02:08:51,510
over the last few years, I'd say. Yeah. That's not surprising at all. I just like that to your

712
02:08:51,510 --> 02:09:00,420
head. Hey, yeah. Lean in. Hey, cheers to that. Oh, sorry. You'll be fine. All right. So what

713
02:09:00,420 --> 02:09:09,699
about these? The top five worst emotes. Data may be fucked because I forgot to include German mustard.

714
02:09:12,090 --> 02:09:17,350
The TV is the worst, but you can't delete it. Something always has to be the worst. There always

715
02:09:17,350 --> 02:09:24,439
has to be like a lich king, right? If I get rid of German TV, something else will take its place.

716
02:09:24,439 --> 02:09:31,449
It just has to be there. Bald coin, 10%, but I don't know. Nowadays, I'm not so sure about that.

717
02:09:31,449 --> 02:09:38,100
We already went over this, but like, I mean, look at it. Look at it now. I didn't delete that emote.

718
02:09:38,100 --> 02:09:44,060
I left it there and I was ridiculed for having the bald coin emote all the way through 2017,

719
02:09:44,060 --> 02:09:51,140
2018, 2019, and here we are. Then just take a look at the price now. I'm not a bald coin.

720
02:09:51,140 --> 02:09:58,810
That fucking is worthless. But the real one. German slug is a bad emote. What's wrong with

721
02:09:58,810 --> 02:10:05,109
German egg? Can you reverse this? German dab goes up to the top, but I can't, you know what?

722
02:10:05,109 --> 02:10:11,609
I can delete that now because it's not the worst one. Oh, this is actually a great data.

723
02:10:11,609 --> 02:10:17,529
German Merck received the least amount of votes for best emote at 0.2% or only three people.

724
02:10:22,260 --> 02:10:36,760
Only three people. I never see that emote, I'll be honest. In fact, it's probably the same three

725
02:10:36,760 --> 02:10:44,170
people that are using that emote on a regular basis. German pain, on the other hand, received

726
02:10:44,170 --> 02:10:49,770
the least amount of votes for worst emote. So 12 people, that's it. German pain is apparently very

727
02:10:49,770 --> 02:10:58,460
high up there, very highly regarded. What's your subscription? Here we go. I am not subscribed.

728
02:10:58,460 --> 02:11:08,729
More than half of you are not subscribed. That's good. Just watch. 15% of you are tier 1,

729
02:11:08,729 --> 02:11:19,210
2% are tier 2, and then 0.8% are tier 3, 20% of you are Twitch Prime, which that's a huge number,

730
02:11:19,210 --> 02:11:27,819
and then 10% of you are a gif sub. Here we go. This is important. This is important. Oh,

731
02:11:27,819 --> 02:11:34,789
wait a minute. Wait a minute. Oh, I'm going to pat my back on this one. Hold on, we'll get to it.

732
02:11:34,869 --> 02:11:45,029
How much have you ever donated to German? $0.75 of you. What's this one? 1 cent to $2.50? 9% of you

733
02:11:45,029 --> 02:11:59,609
have. $2.50 to $10? 7%. Over 10 but under 25? 2.8%. And then this is interesting here. So less than

734
02:11:59,609 --> 02:12:12,069
50 but over 25 is 1.1%, but over 50 but under 100 is 2.4%. And then over 100 is more than under 50.

735
02:12:12,069 --> 02:12:19,699
That's pretty interesting. But yeah, again, 75% of you don't give... I don't. Just don't do it.

736
02:12:19,699 --> 02:12:24,020
Just hang out, enjoy the stream, chill in the community. That's 100% cool by me.

737
02:12:24,020 --> 02:12:33,369
So what's the best content? Here we go. What is the best content on this stream?

738
02:12:33,369 --> 02:12:47,079
Old games, 47%. New games, 32%. Talking to chat, 48%. Playing with others, 27%. Playing the game.

739
02:12:47,319 --> 02:12:54,180
Playing the game is at 13%. So those of you that are in this chat right now,

740
02:12:54,180 --> 02:12:59,479
that yell at me to play the video game. Dude, what are you doing? Like, play the game, man.

741
02:12:59,479 --> 02:13:07,539
That's only 13% of you want me to do that. It's like 80 fucking 7% of you do not want me to play

742
02:13:07,539 --> 02:13:19,579
the game. German having fun is 60, whatever German like, 70, and anything is 61. They have buzz kills.

743
02:13:22,500 --> 02:13:34,140
The math doesn't add up here. Oh wait, it doesn't. What's that based on?

744
02:13:35,100 --> 02:13:41,060
Stop. You can select multiple answers. Oh, okay. Multiple choice. Okay, cool. I see.

745
02:13:43,859 --> 02:13:48,500
Oh, German heart. Well, thank you guys. Yeah, playing the game, 13% of you.

746
02:13:48,500 --> 02:13:52,380
Just remember that the next time. Remember that the next time we're talking about like,

747
02:13:52,380 --> 02:14:01,939
eating dog food for five minutes. And there's that. And there is one more to look at. Really,

748
02:14:01,939 --> 02:14:13,029
really cool. Last one. Very elaborate, I told you. This first one is no longer relevant.

749
02:14:13,029 --> 02:14:17,770
You watched the end of the stream bits portion. A lot of you actually did. A lot of you did.

750
02:14:17,770 --> 02:14:28,500
But a lot of you didn't. Do you take showers? All right, cat or dog? Let's see what we have here.

751
02:14:28,500 --> 02:14:37,689
Both? Neither. 5.2% of you said neither. Hmm. Looks like we have a little bit more cat people

752
02:14:37,689 --> 02:14:47,590
here than dog people. I would consider myself to be a dog person. Although, I do enjoy cats.

753
02:14:47,590 --> 02:14:52,489
I just think I enjoy dogs a little more. I would probably say I was a dog person.

754
02:14:53,819 --> 02:14:59,560
Do you prefer Twitch chat or Discord? I thought this was going to be a lot

755
02:14:59,560 --> 02:15:08,090
larger of a gap here. But tons of you guys prefer Discord. That's why it's there.

756
02:15:08,090 --> 02:15:18,439
Do you like Bugleberry? No, that's not... That majority rules here. He ain't going anywhere,

757
02:15:18,439 --> 02:15:28,100
ever. That's a large amount of people that say no, but that's a much bigger amount of people

758
02:15:28,100 --> 02:15:36,630
that said yes. Have you ever canceled plans to watch this stream? Yes, 38% of you guys have

759
02:15:36,630 --> 02:15:43,750
canceled plans. Is that what happens when people say, hey dude, I took work off to watch this

760
02:15:43,750 --> 02:15:56,539
stream and it sucked today? Oh, I get it now. I feel bad. Well, sorry to the 38% of you maybe

761
02:15:56,539 --> 02:16:02,220
that took off work or told your friends you were busy for the Die Dallas encounter stream. Sorry

762
02:16:02,220 --> 02:16:16,600
about that. FTK, oh no. Do you take showers or baths? 84% take showers. Yeah. Does that mean

763
02:16:16,600 --> 02:16:28,890
you never take a bath? Because I do both. Put me in that 11.3%. Where's neither? I don't fit in the

764
02:16:28,890 --> 02:16:36,379
tub. Who takes a bath? Well, I take a bath to relax. I take a shower to clean, a bath to relax.

765
02:16:36,379 --> 02:16:47,270
I think they do different things. Would you beat Jerma in a fight? No and yes. I think a lot of you

766
02:16:47,270 --> 02:16:56,870
just underestimate how explosive I could be. People just underestimate me. No, don't underestimate me.

767
02:16:56,870 --> 02:17:16,219
I'm explosive. No, I can fight quickly, very strongly. Explosively cute.

768
02:17:18,680 --> 02:17:25,590
Would you attend a JermaCon or a Jexpo? A lot of you said yes to this, but I feel like this number

769
02:17:25,590 --> 02:17:39,020
drops a ton when the tickets go on sale. This probably drops to like 4%. So I'm not so sure

770
02:17:39,020 --> 02:17:50,309
about that. Does Jerma make your day better? No or yes? 0.6% said no. Does that mean I'm making

771
02:17:50,309 --> 02:17:56,979
your day worse? That seems like a lot of people. How many people here right now? 13,000. What's

772
02:17:56,979 --> 02:18:10,149
1% of 13,000? 130? So there are 130 people here right now that are making your day worse. Oh,

773
02:18:10,149 --> 02:18:21,420
I'm sorry about that. Do you eat ass? Of course I do, of course I don't. A lot of you guys eat ass.

774
02:18:21,420 --> 02:18:34,010
A lot of ass eaters. That's a majority ass eater. Are you single or in a relationship? Single. Hey,

775
02:18:34,010 --> 02:18:41,430
got a lot of single people here. A lot of people in a relationship too. 25% in a relationship.

776
02:18:41,430 --> 02:18:47,780
25% of people are lying. I don't know. I don't think about that. I'm not so sure about that.

777
02:18:47,780 --> 02:18:57,590
That's cool. There you go. That was Krosky that made all this. Krosky, you're going to have to

778
02:18:57,590 --> 02:19:05,159
work your magic again in like another couple of years. You need a dating app. Like a Jerma

779
02:19:05,319 --> 02:19:18,459
dating app. Do a Cupid stream. No, I do not think so. No, no, no. I'm not having any hand in that.

780
02:19:18,459 --> 02:19:26,729
Oh, and you two can be together and date. Oh, that's so cool. Like fucking six months later

781
02:19:26,729 --> 02:19:36,489
when you have a ton of relationship problems. You guys are going to blame me. You guys are both

782
02:19:36,489 --> 02:19:45,819
going to be thinking internally, why the fuck did I do that? That asshole for content got us on there

783
02:19:45,819 --> 02:19:56,489
and like fuck that guy. That's what happened. I'm not doing that. You meet somebody, you meet

784
02:19:56,489 --> 02:20:11,059
somebody. You need to do a Cupid stream. I think we finally do a fake one. Do like a

785
02:20:13,239 --> 02:20:21,829
have a fake dating show. Too many projects, guys. You don't have to put it on the bottom of the

786
02:20:21,829 --> 02:20:27,620
list. There's too many things that are happening. There you go. That was the 2020 census that we

787
02:20:27,620 --> 02:20:40,040
did in 2021. Pretty interesting stuff. The bachelor Jex. All right, let's go back to what

788
02:20:40,040 --> 02:20:58,440
we were doing here. I need a new OST, please. Something we haven't seen. Sims furniture. The

789
02:20:58,440 --> 02:21:18,680
Sims by theme. That's not bad. Sims by theme. OK, what the fuck was that? All right, that's good.

790
02:21:18,680 --> 02:21:35,559
Let's go. So nostalgic. After this, I'm picking streamers choice. We're going to do zoom out

791
02:21:35,559 --> 02:21:42,149
roller coaster tycoon music. Zoomed way out song. I don't know what it's called. That's what I'm

792
02:21:42,149 --> 02:22:00,469
going to type into search. How much money do I have? Only 375 coins. Not doing that yet. What

793
02:22:00,469 --> 02:22:09,350
about the printers? Leaf printer. OK, I need to I need more coins. I need more coins. All right,

794
02:22:09,350 --> 02:22:26,010
I can start this now. Let's do some up wage. Oh, airplane turbine. I could get the other one,

795
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:39,079
but should I? No, no, we got to do upgrades. Get the other one. Leaf powered leaf blower,

796
02:22:39,079 --> 02:22:47,190
a leaf blower powered with leaves. Full circle. What? I don't get it. I don't understand. What does

797
02:22:47,190 --> 02:23:12,739
that mean? Is it more powerful? Ow. Like I think ow. Ow, you're right. That hurt. There we go.

798
02:23:12,739 --> 02:23:39,370
Undertale. I want to hear that. Undertale. Dog song. That's the one, right? Dad. All right,

801
02:24:09,430 --> 02:24:20,100
Max combo. Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up. That was it. OK, now what? Let's go to.

02:24:34,579 --> 02:24:46,649
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Roller coaster tycoon zoom out song. There it is. Oh,

02:24:46,649 --> 02:25:07,379

804
02:25:07,379 --> 02:25:25,139
here. Fuck, I got it wrong. Not yet. I mean, wait. More, more, more, more. Trees, trees, trees. More

805
02:25:25,139 --> 02:25:52,040
trees. More fuel. And here. Now we have another one. Bismuth. Bismuth leaves are now dropping.

806
02:25:52,760 --> 02:26:13,020
This was my printer. Oh, it's the converter. 100 platinum to one Bismuth. Start it. New leaf drop.

807
02:26:13,020 --> 02:26:27,370
Yep. It's more. Another one. I have a lot of gold. All right, I'm going to dump the gold.

808
02:26:28,170 --> 02:26:38,819
What do we got? A ton of trees. Fertilizer. More. More. Play Rimworld. I will after this.

809
02:26:39,459 --> 02:26:45,370
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. The OST. No, I won't. I'm not going to play the Rimworld OST. I'm not

810
02:26:45,370 --> 02:26:51,299
because I want to play Rimworld. I don't want to hear the OST before I play the game.

811
02:26:52,260 --> 02:27:04,329
Kill that snowman. I need more combos. Somebody's freaking out right now going Max combos. You

812
02:27:04,329 --> 02:27:19,590
stupid streamer. Like Katamari. I do need to play another Katamari. Kill, kill, kill, kill.

813
02:27:20,709 --> 02:27:36,469
How about the Sonic? Yeah, how about the Sonic? Rolling. Yeah, that's a good one. I feel like I

814
02:27:36,469 --> 02:27:46,629
play this every time we do songs. I play this every time there's a song request portion of the

815
02:27:46,629 --> 02:28:03,610
stream. Sing it. No, I can't sing it because it's going to get added to a list somewhere.

816
02:28:04,940 --> 02:28:19,399
I know. I have 2,000 of the rainbow ones. Sing it. Fine. No.

817
02:28:37,049 --> 02:28:41,270
The amount of people that sing this song and hum this song and have played this song.

818
02:28:42,149 --> 02:28:48,469
This is such an iconic song. Is the guy that made this song like get anything for this?

819
02:28:48,469 --> 02:29:02,700
Is he the official Sonic the Hedgehog music producer? Is this guy's band still doing the

820
02:29:02,700 --> 02:29:12,200
Sonic the Hedgehog music stuff for all the other things? Yes. All right, that's good.

821
02:29:13,899 --> 02:29:24,219
I wonder if there's any pressure there. Look at it like follow me, set me free. Everybody loves

822
02:29:24,219 --> 02:29:28,379
this song. I think he sits there and he's like, fuck, I need another escape from the goddamn city.

823
02:29:29,340 --> 02:29:45,260
I think this guy makes this fucking gold. It doesn't matter. This song sucks. I don't even

824
02:29:45,260 --> 02:29:51,639
like Sonic the Hedgehog and I disagree with you. I've not enjoyed a Sonic the Hedgehog piece of

825
02:29:51,639 --> 02:29:59,940
media since probably 15 years ago. It's honest. I love the character. I think the character is

826
02:29:59,940 --> 02:30:05,940
awesome. I think the songs are great. I mean, it's what? It's iconic classic video game history.

827
02:30:05,940 --> 02:30:19,540
This is just auto playing. I'm just going to let it do what it wants to do. All right,

828
02:30:19,540 --> 02:30:42,250
let's spend some money. Let's max this all up. I said I didn't want to do it. This is why I said

829
02:30:42,250 --> 02:30:46,409
I didn't want to fucking do this. This doesn't count because I told you it was going to fucking

830
02:30:46,409 --> 02:31:04,340
happen. It doesn't count. I try. Of course you can't do that. It's an incredibly difficult

831
02:31:04,340 --> 02:31:35,959
thing to do. It takes like years of classical singing training. It's already put out. Fucking

832
02:31:35,959 --> 02:31:47,379
learn. You need to fucking learn. You're a dumb time to learn. You need to fucking learn.

833
02:31:56,860 --> 02:32:00,379
That was mean. I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about whoever's

834
02:32:00,379 --> 02:32:05,020
currently listening to the song. But the artist decided that was what he was going to do. I'm

835
02:32:05,020 --> 02:32:27,420
not talking about you guys in particular. Oh boy. Large paint roller. What? Does it hurt?

836
02:32:39,659 --> 02:33:33,260
Oh, he doesn't. He does not. Um, what does that? It's, um, from Tony Hawk. Tony Hawk's

837
02:33:33,260 --> 02:33:46,649
Pro Skater. The yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So fuck all your rules and fuck all your. Offspring.

838
02:33:46,649 --> 02:33:56,709
There it is. Is this the one? Can't play the rest of it, but I just wanted to make sure.

839
02:33:57,270 --> 02:34:04,739
Does that happen in the Sonic song? It definitely does. Somewhere at the end.

840
02:34:05,860 --> 02:34:13,379
And it goes yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Wait, did it just happen? It just happened? Wait,

841
02:34:14,340 --> 02:34:32,969
did that just happen? Holy shit. Okay. I guess I found it. I guess I found it. Okay.

842
02:34:46,120 --> 02:34:47,399
Oh, all right.

843
02:34:47,399 --> 02:35:07,459
All right, it's time to, what do I got coins? Nope. I want 5k. I don't want this 1.2k

844
02:35:08,100 --> 02:35:28,170
bull crap. 1.2k Andy. He's got a huge raid just came in. I love that monster raid. This is monster

845
02:35:28,170 --> 02:35:40,569

846
02:35:40,569 --> 02:35:50,040

847
02:35:50,040 --> 02:35:59,829

848
02:35:59,829 --> 02:36:04,709
it's pretty good? I think it's kind of good. But no, thanks Five Up. That's a, that's just a fucking

849
02:36:04,709 --> 02:36:12,389
shitload of people. Hey, what's going on everybody? Hope you had fun. Welcome, welcome, welcome.

Thank you so much. This is Leafblower, Attack of the Leaves. The whole thing is you clear.

851
02:36:23,030 --> 02:36:29,100
It's an idle game and it's so good. It's so fun. It's engaging and it makes you,

852

02:36:38,010 --> 02:36:50,020
Splatoon. What's the one that goes? What's the one? Does it a few times? All of them do it. Oh,

854
02:36:50,020 --> 02:37:06,489
okay. All right. Which one's better? One or two. Splatoon OST. Yeah, this is the

855
02:37:10,649 --> 02:37:13,909
that's like the royalty free version that I just did, but you know, the one that's a song, right?

856
02:37:14,549 --> 02:37:37,959
All right. Spend money. I got 1.4 million. All right. Max up the trees, max up fertilizer,

857
02:37:37,959 --> 02:37:44,360
and then I'm going to start banking money. More combos, more combos. I need way more combos.

858
02:37:48,709 --> 02:37:54,309
More trees. Get them. More fertilizer. Get them. More marketing. Get the leaf blowers. More trees.

859
02:37:54,309 --> 02:38:17,000
More fertilizer. Dump it. You're a squid now. You're a kid. You're a squid. Scroll down.

860
02:38:17,639 --> 02:38:23,700
I will. Change locations. The trees spawn business leaves.

861
02:38:25,719 --> 02:38:40,469
They what? Couldn't I stay at the other one? Go back. That was wrong. Oh.

862
02:38:41,190 --> 02:38:57,850
Mm hmm. Oh my fucking God, dude. What the fuck? Oh, that's another rate. What is happening right

863
02:38:57,850 --> 02:39:06,899

867
02:39:30,420 --> 02:39:36,819
did it, but I'm going to do it again. Hey, welcome or welcome. We're playing leafblower simulator.

868
02:39:36,819 --> 02:39:42,469
Uh, leafblower revolutions. Pretty, it's pretty sick. I highly recommend it. If you don't have

869
02:39:42,469 --> 02:39:47,100
you kind of bored one day, you just want to play a game where you scoop up some, uh, leaves and

02:39:47,180 --> 02:39:52,219
welcome. Thanks for the rate. This is huge. 26,000 people, 25,000. Holy shit.

871
02:39:57,399 --> 02:40:06,010
Leaf. There's the thing, right? The day that I'm playing leafblower, uh, extreme simulator,

872
02:40:06,010 --> 02:40:11,340
it's like a stadium full of people just walked in and I'm sitting there just like, I'm playing

873
02:40:11,340 --> 02:40:16,920
solitaire with myself and like 20,000 people just fucking showed up. This is like how you feel

874
02:40:17,479 --> 02:40:22,500
if like you have a party that you're throwing and all you have in the fridge is like milk

875
02:40:22,500 --> 02:40:26,920
and a half eaten bag of Lays potato chips, like the crunchy crumbly part of the bottom.

876
02:40:26,920 --> 02:40:31,479
And it's like, I'm, I don't, I'm not ready for this company. I guess like you can have some milk.

877
02:40:31,479 --> 02:40:38,569
You guys like milk. Do you want some milk? Everyone's got like big foam hands and I'm

878
02:40:38,569 --> 02:40:45,690
passing out like two teaspoons of milk to each one of you. And I just put the TV on. I'm like,

879
02:40:45,690 --> 02:40:51,690
ah, I got Netflix. I put on, uh, have you, have you seen, have you seen the wire? That's a really

880
02:40:51,690 --> 02:41:02,170
good show. They will put that on. And then I walk upstairs, there's 25, fucking thousand people in

881
02:41:02,170 --> 02:41:09,290
my house and I'm just like throwing fucking cold water in my face. All right. I'm going to get

882
02:41:09,290 --> 02:41:11,930
down there and I'm going to, I'm going to pause the wire and I'm going to piss everybody off.

883
02:41:11,930 --> 02:41:17,819
Cause it's a great show. I better have something to say that's better than the wire. I better go

884
02:41:17,819 --> 02:41:22,620
down with like magic tricks and stuff. I gotta, I gotta open up my old like kids magic trick booklet

885
02:41:22,620 --> 02:41:29,190
but on there and do like coin tricks. The music. Oh shit. You're right. But thank you guys.

886
02:41:29,190 --> 02:41:36,629
Seriously. This is a, this is just, that's three monster raids in like an hour. Hey, split down.

887
02:41:45,659 --> 02:41:49,180
Do Presto Magesto again. Yeah, I know. I have to pull up Presto Magesto.

888
02:41:49,739 --> 02:41:58,409
Put on Xenoblade Chronicles. All right. You're like, give me, uh, give me two minutes.

889
02:42:01,590 --> 02:42:18,600
Cosmic Leaves can spawn. I can't do that yet. Shit. I keep forgetting to do the combo. I need to do

890
02:42:18,600 --> 02:42:32,969
combos. I have to do more combos. Another raid? No, it's not. Don't say that. That would be insane.

891
02:42:34,860 --> 02:42:48,840
No, no it isn't. Put on Tropico. Oh, the Xenoblade is, okay, we'll do Xenoblade after this.

892
02:42:49,319 --> 02:42:59,940
Put on Chuck E. Cheese. Chuck E. Cheese has songs? Does he just dance to like generic advertising

893
02:42:59,940 --> 02:43:08,790
music? I feel like Chuck E. Cheese's song, Chuck E. Cheese just dances to like generic rock riff

894
02:43:08,790 --> 02:43:30,229
four. Okay. What do we got? This is the part. This is what I like this part a lot. Wait till that's

895
02:43:30,229 --> 02:43:39,209
5k. Not yet. Is this like a, is this a Bon Jovi moment where like Bon Jovi's doing this with his

896
02:43:39,209 --> 02:44:04,329
mouth? With like a weird like kazoo in his mouth going like wah wah. Oh, that's not Bon Jovi.

897
02:44:04,329 --> 02:44:21,510
Right. That's not the guitar. That's not the guitar making that noise. No, it isn't. What's that?

898
02:44:21,510 --> 02:44:32,149
It's my life. It's my life. I can only play the first five seconds of this. Yeah, that's somebody

899
02:44:32,149 --> 02:44:49,399
going wow wow with like a weird device in their mouth. Yes, it is. I thought I just died. All right,

900
02:44:49,399 --> 02:44:54,840
we're going Xenoblade Chronicles. Xenoblade Chronicles. Which one? The first one or the

901
02:44:54,840 --> 02:45:12,139
second one? What do you guys think? This is a little too sad for me right now. This is a little,

902
02:45:12,219 --> 02:45:28,420
this is kind of sad for me. Who doesn't suck? I don't know. I haven't played it. I need more

903
02:45:28,420 --> 02:45:37,139
combos. Gold apples. How do I not have those yet? Combos. It's 6.5 million. I'm going to,

904
02:45:37,139 --> 02:45:48,250

905
02:45:48,250 --> 02:46:00,360
Auto leaf blower. Oh, okay. Platinum apples. I don't even, I can't even, I shouldn't unlock them,

906
02:46:00,360 --> 02:46:08,069
right? Unlock Bismuth apples. Yeah, definitely. Hit damage. Oh, they can actually damage enemies.

907
02:46:08,069 --> 02:46:34,200
Okay. That's cool. That's too sad. That's too sad for me. Unpluck. What do I need? I need 500

908
02:46:34,200 --> 02:46:42,180
cosmic leaves to get the new one. Bro, turn this off. All right. Let's get to the middle.

909
02:46:43,379 --> 02:46:54,010
It's too sad for me. Skip, skip again. It's too sad. This is too sad for me. Skip again. Like

910
02:46:54,010 --> 02:47:12,280
halfway. I'm six hours into the OST. Are there any snot sad songs in Xenoblade? I'm looking for

911
02:47:12,280 --> 02:47:21,379
a little bit of pep. Where's the pep? This is good OST, but a little too sad for me. Here we go.

912
02:47:22,180 --> 02:47:34,180
I need coins. All right. How are we doing on the converter here? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 3000.

913
02:47:34,180 --> 02:47:49,690
Come on in. Get 5k. These Bismuth leaves are just racking in money. Racking in prestige coins.

914
02:47:50,489 --> 02:48:06,100
What is it? Racking? Raking in? Racking in money. Yeah, racking in money. Yeah, that makes sense.

915
02:48:22,579 --> 02:48:30,659
Everywhere. How about some original Nier? I'll give it a try. Just not Nier Automata, right? Nier

916
02:48:30,659 --> 02:48:54,389
1 OST. Is this the right one? Is this correct? We wanted Plok. Well, hold on. I need more

917
02:48:54,389 --> 02:49:08,819
Bismuth leaves right now or I'm going to be very upset. Can cosmic leaves even be picked up?

918
02:49:08,819 --> 02:49:14,229
I don't have to know. They don't. I have to go to another location. No, something else.

919
02:49:15,190 --> 02:49:40,280
What are you saying? Almost at 5k and then I'm prestiging. This boss is going to be unwatchable,

920
02:49:40,280 --> 02:49:52,440
will it? Isn't video game music fine? A video game OST should be fine, right? Otherwise,

921
02:49:52,440 --> 02:50:06,420
how would you like play any of these games on stream? Play Shadowlands. Um, I already did.

922
02:50:15,819 --> 02:50:25,260
Dermot, I'm shaking. You need to play Killer Instinct. All right, fine. I just want to hear

923
02:50:25,979 --> 02:50:30,299
Killer. Will you just remind me? I just want to hear that. It goes like this. Hold on. Let me

924
02:50:30,299 --> 02:50:38,780
see if I can get this out of memory. So anytime that you, I would, I could do an ultra combo in

925
02:50:38,780 --> 02:50:45,110
that game and you would catch somebody in an ultra combo. I think it was the, it was the wolf.

926
02:50:45,110 --> 02:50:47,829
I remember I used to play against a friend and I would ultra combo the fuck out of him and this

927
02:50:47,829 --> 02:51:08,180
is always here every time. And then we have a go. Hold on. Let me get it. Hello? Hello?

928
02:51:16,860 --> 02:51:25,940
Did that work? I'd just be sitting there going like.

929
02:51:32,659 --> 02:51:38,149
And I would fuck him up every time and he would, I would leave my house because it was just, I was

930
02:51:38,149 --> 02:51:49,719
he was so bad. He couldn't even do anything. It was a precise button combo with a glacial,

931
02:51:49,719 --> 02:52:02,309
glacier. That was the guy I could do it with. I'm sorry. Killer Instinct ultra combo on what's the,

932
02:52:03,190 --> 02:52:08,760
what's the dog, what's the animal's name? What's the dog? Folgor. No, no, no, not Folgor.

933
02:52:09,319 --> 02:52:17,459
Oh, what's the, what was the name? Saber Wolf. Okay. Killer Instinct ultra combo on Saber Wolf.

934
02:52:19,030 --> 02:52:31,129
Like doing it to Saber Wolf. It needs to be done to Saber Wolf. Let's see. Glacier ultra combo.

935
02:52:31,129 --> 02:52:35,129
Let's see if we can find one that's on Saber Wolf and I'll show you guys how fucking nuts it was.

936
02:52:35,690 --> 02:53:27,219
Okay. Here we go. Now this is the new one. Do it. Finish the combo, dude. It's 150 hits.

937
02:53:28,020 --> 02:53:55,370
Holy shit. That was crazy. What's the next OST? Catherine. Okay. Catherine OST.

938
02:53:59,620 --> 02:54:23,059
Is the complete OST. Okay. This is DMC here. Okay. Catherine, let me ask a question about Catherine.

939
02:54:24,139 --> 02:54:29,020
So I've looked at it before. Oh wow. That looks kind of interesting. But isn't it kind of like

940
02:54:29,020 --> 02:54:45,059
a Qbert game where you just like climb blocks? That's where it lost me a little. I feel like

941
02:54:45,059 --> 02:54:54,219
I probably wouldn't enjoy it that much. It gets disturbing. I'm sure it does, but I don't know

942
02:54:54,219 --> 02:55:11,659
if I want to do the Qbert stuff. It's also a band game on Twitch. It is? Is the music banned on

943
02:55:11,659 --> 02:55:20,040
Twitch too? Should I not play it? No, it's not. What? I'm not going to pop like the Twitch algorithm

944
02:55:20,040 --> 02:55:25,430
off, right? Everybody's playing Catherine. It's a band game. Turn off their stream immediately.

945
02:55:28,139 --> 02:55:33,530
All right. What do we got? All right. I can prestige. Hold on. Not yet though.

946
02:55:34,409 --> 02:55:58,020
Let's get a few more minutes of this. Play Katamari. I will. I'm just trying to get as

947
02:55:58,020 --> 02:56:07,379
much as possible out of this before I prestige. All right. We're at five point. Maybe I can get

948
02:56:07,379 --> 02:56:28,139
it to like six. More. So we're going to unlock like the next two or three areas

949
02:56:28,940 --> 02:56:35,020
and I'm going to dump all my money into, I don't know. What should I buy? We'll find out very soon.

950
02:56:35,659 --> 02:56:43,319
Katamari. Which? All right. What Katamari OST? I've really played the first one already.

951
02:56:43,959 --> 02:56:53,659
Which one? Your choice. What do you want? What do you feel like? We love Katamari. Oh,

952
02:56:53,659 --> 02:57:13,260
I thought you guys were just saying that. 55 gems. All right. We love Katamari OST.

953
02:57:13,979 --> 02:57:33,000
Kind of loud, but all right. Does this one go, no, no, no, no, no, no, no? I hope. I'm just waiting

954
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:38,860
for the song to hedgehog guide if this sounds like that. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

955
02:57:38,940 --> 02:57:47,530
You should get them to do that.

956
02:57:55,829 --> 02:57:56,629
Turn it up. All right.

957
02:58:04,920 --> 02:58:10,889
I can't do this. Beatbox with them. No, it'd be embarrassing. It's so much better.

958
02:58:18,620 --> 02:58:20,459
All right. I'm ready to prestige at 6,000.

959
02:58:20,459 --> 02:58:28,420
Turn it up. I just I will. I don't want to be able to hear after the talk.

960
02:58:30,500 --> 02:58:35,219
Nothing I hate more than going to like a bar or a party or a restaurant or something.

961
02:58:35,860 --> 02:58:40,659
And the music is over a level where I cannot talk to you. That's the fastest way to make me

962
02:58:40,659 --> 02:58:46,020
to fucking leave your house or whatever. If I have to lean in and yell into your ear for us to talk

963
02:58:46,020 --> 02:58:56,579
about, like what drink you ordered. All right. Yeah, let's go over here.

964
02:58:56,579 --> 02:59:16,979
Wait, did that happen? What are you saying? I'm talking.

965
02:59:21,059 --> 02:59:37,450
All right. I'm ready for Steve. Go. All right. I have. All right. Turn this down.

966
02:59:39,129 --> 02:59:49,190
I have 6,000 coins. Auto upgrade freeze. Should I do that? Let's go down.

967
02:59:50,469 --> 02:59:55,190
ALBs can collect fruits for you now. Should they also do your tax report? I mean,

968
02:59:55,190 --> 03:00:02,790
might as well get it. Higher chance to spawn multiple fruits. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

969
03:00:02,790 --> 03:00:06,229
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

970
03:00:06,229 --> 03:00:23,190
Yes. No, that's too much. How do I unlock that? More leaves. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

971
03:00:23,190 --> 03:00:31,850
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. More coins. I'm done.

972
03:00:31,850 --> 03:00:55,139
Space. Oh, my good thing. I clicked that and had enough to buy it. Let's go to space.

973
03:00:56,739 --> 03:01:09,059
Gold leaves. Come on. More trees. Come on, Gwen. More fertilizer. Come on, Gwen. More marketing.

974
03:01:09,059 --> 03:01:21,059
Come on, Gwen. Automatic leaf blowers. Come on, Gwen. Scorpions in space. I can't. Next one.

975
03:01:21,540 --> 03:01:53,000
Hmm. Okay. More. More fertilizer. Enough of that. More money. We are in space. It's perfect.

976
03:02:00,940 --> 03:02:06,440
I feel like I am one of the princes right now. I feel like this is going to live in that same

977
03:02:06,440 --> 03:02:29,879
universe right now. Another gold. I do. I have enough for a trees. More trees. More fertilizer.

978
03:02:29,879 --> 03:02:54,780
Do Mechanicus OST in a little bit. Just hold on. What even is that? What console is that for?

979
03:02:55,420 --> 03:03:16,469
It's not for console. It's for PC. These things are heavy. Look at it. More trees. I'm going to

980
03:03:16,469 --> 03:03:23,079
set the converter up now. Old converter. Get that started. And the platinum converter. Get that

981
03:03:23,079 --> 03:03:33,399
started. Yeah. Printer. How much money do I have? I want to get a cosmic leaf printer just because

982
03:03:34,440 --> 03:03:45,459
I'm going to get it because I want money. Stop talking. Nobody cares about this game.

983
03:03:46,899 --> 03:04:02,819
Well, I'm going to beat it. Do you beat it? Do you win? Or is it just never ending? Well,

984
03:04:02,819 --> 03:04:13,110
I'm going to play until I don't feel like it anymore. How's that sound? Be swore. Oh, let me

985
03:04:13,110 --> 03:04:36,979
change my skin. Bird. Ace of spades. Okay. I have a lot of... Let's get... I need... I actually need

986
03:04:36,979 --> 03:04:58,389
to turn that converter off. Turn this off. Buy more trees. Play Sonic CD. All the stuff is at the

987
03:04:58,389 --> 03:05:13,100
bottom. What? What do you mean? I'm buying it. Oh, I can buy business trees. Void leaves. Trees can

988
03:05:13,100 --> 03:05:37,430
drop void leaves? What about bismuth? Yeah. More bismuth. I need a better... Oh, hold on. Okay.

989
03:05:38,860 --> 03:06:01,239
Rocket engine. Pretty powerful. It's hard to blow the cosmic leaves though. These are very heavy.

990
03:06:02,459 --> 03:06:08,020
Too heavy. I don't like that. Katamari, I love you. All right. We'll do one more Katamari song,

991
03:06:08,020 --> 03:06:29,260
and then we're going to move on to mechanical OST. Okay. Not this one. Increase your coins. All

992
03:06:29,260 --> 03:06:35,020
right. Hold on. How many coins do I have? Time travel by 30 minutes. Receive offline rewards for

993
03:06:35,020 --> 03:06:43,299
the next 30 minutes instantly. Do I do that? Is this going to pretend like I've been playing

994
03:06:43,299 --> 03:07:06,629
for 30 minutes? No, don't. That's correct, right? Do the six hour one. I just use it? Holy shit.

995
03:07:07,430 --> 03:07:21,260
Oh my God. What happened? What happened? Holy shit. I have 13,000 coins. Just do that again.

996
03:07:22,219 --> 03:07:39,219
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Void leaves. Holy shit. I have so many now.

997
03:07:49,590 --> 03:08:03,430
I'm about to just go nuts here. It's going to be so much more spawning.

998
03:08:10,090 --> 03:08:16,489
Get more fuel. Get more blowers. More speed. More battery. More power. Power up.

999
03:08:18,340 --> 03:08:24,260
Up. I have to. I'm going to do it. Power up. There we go. I feel a little bit better.

1000
03:08:24,260 --> 03:08:52,819
Let's take over the whole screen. I don't have any combos. All right, let's go. 13K.

1001
03:08:53,620 --> 03:09:08,309
Oh, I killed the Vulture. I can sing a song for you and me. I can sing a song for you and me.

1002
03:09:09,350 --> 03:09:20,250
I get it. There's a technique to get the cosmic ones because they're much heavier.

1003
03:09:31,079 --> 03:09:40,569
I love it. This is a great song. What a great song. You guys ever think that when you listen

1004
03:09:40,569 --> 03:09:45,129
to a video game soundtrack and there might be an artist on there that you listen to,

1005
03:09:45,129 --> 03:09:49,290
you're like, oh, holy shit, this is really good. I've never looked up who this person was.

1006
03:09:50,170 --> 03:09:53,020
I don't know what band this is, but I probably would like their music.

1007
03:09:53,899 --> 03:09:57,340
But I just don't. I'm just like, oh, I'm going to listen to that one song that I like that I

1008
03:09:57,340 --> 03:10:00,059
know that you made great. But I'm not going to listen to any of your other music.

1009
03:10:00,860 --> 03:10:20,090
Anybody else do that? Yikes. Yikes. Why yikes? What are you talking about?

1010
03:10:21,479 --> 03:10:28,600
I'm going to do it at 50,000. How's that sound? More, more, more, more, more. Oh,

1011
03:10:28,600 --> 03:10:43,239
I can go up to 50. All right. At 50,000 coins, I'm going to do it again. That should happen

1012
03:10:43,239 --> 03:10:57,290
pretty. Yeah. I'm already at 16.7. I'm like red flasks. More, more, more, more, more, more,

1013
03:10:57,290 --> 03:11:09,020
more. Give me more. Everything. I need more of everything. What song was the one before this one?

1014
03:11:09,979 --> 03:11:30,059
Um, that was called Everlasting Love. 60 coins. Can I do that again? My time.

1015
03:11:30,940 --> 03:11:35,239
Time travel again. 30 minutes have just gone by. How much money do I have?

1016
03:11:36,120 --> 03:11:56,899
I'm at 41 fucking K. This is huge. I need higher combos. Combo multipliers. That'll help.

1017
03:11:57,540 --> 03:12:12,790
Times 31. Play some 8-bit song covers. I'm going to start all these. Then I can get some void ones.

1018
03:12:14,200 --> 03:12:25,940
Holy shit. This game never ends. Okay. Void trees. I'm going to get this to over 50 K.

1019
03:12:26,819 --> 03:12:31,459
Shit. I should have held it and still, ah, I should have held that until I had void trees.

1020
03:12:31,459 --> 03:12:47,610
I can buy one. That's a much better technique. Bottom to top. We'll wait for a few spawns.

1021
03:12:48,170 --> 03:12:59,780
One more and then I'm going to go top, bottom to top. Ready? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That's the one.

1022
03:12:59,780 --> 03:13:08,309
That's the technique right there. Let's do, wait to, oh, my automatic pushers are doing great too.

1023
03:13:09,270 --> 03:13:21,110
Oh, you know, I love it. More void trees and more void fertilizer and more void apples.

1024
03:13:21,909 --> 03:13:32,860
Tell us a story. One day there was a little boy who went to get a pail of water. He got it. He

1025
03:13:32,860 --> 03:13:40,549
filled up his burkey and he loved it. It was clean water. It was crisp and all contaminants were

1026
03:13:40,549 --> 03:14:04,440
removed. What do I got? 45. I'll wait till 50. Maybe I should just do it now. Fuck it. Right.

1027
03:14:04,440 --> 03:14:15,219
Just do it now. I think I'm just going to do it now. Oh wait. Maybe I should buy another. What?

1028
03:14:17,850 --> 03:14:33,899
Oh no. Okay. Use it. 70,000 fucking coins. Oh, a laser.

1029
03:14:40,440 --> 03:14:53,909
This is much more powerful than the cosmic ones. Oh, look at this. More coins. Shit to do. All

1030
03:14:53,909 --> 03:15:09,559
right. Hold on. Is this all max? Buy max. Buy max. Buy max. Buy, just buy, buy max. Buy max on

1031
03:15:09,559 --> 03:15:25,350
everything. Hey, what about four? Buy max on everything. Yeah. This is not gas. Max, max, max,

1032
03:15:25,350 --> 03:15:38,309
max, max it all up. Buy an enemy bumper. Okay. More. Max out everything. And then I'm just going

1033
03:15:38,309 --> 03:15:43,209
to coast for a little while and then I'll prestige. And I'm going to buy like an area that's like five

1034
03:15:43,209 --> 03:15:56,389
times over here. Okay. Here we go. Let's just collect for a little bit. 71,000 coins. Promise

1035
03:15:56,389 --> 03:16:01,540
center, second opinion. Yeah. We've been hunting for long enough. All right. Persona four, golden

1036
03:16:01,540 --> 03:16:05,940
OST. Sure. What the fuck did I just do? I think I just print screened like five times. Oops.

1037
03:16:06,500 --> 03:16:28,920
Persona four, golden OST. DFCA? Oh. Should I be aware of that? Should I be aware of that?

1038
03:16:31,450 --> 03:16:56,010
Are we sure? One guy. Okay. Oops. I think a bug just flew in my eye.

1039
03:16:57,420 --> 03:17:01,420
Like a bug just tried to desperately get into my eyeball, I think. I freaked out and just

1040
03:17:01,420 --> 03:17:07,260
grabbed my face. I don't know. I have no idea what happened. I could feel like a bunch of legs

1041
03:17:07,260 --> 03:17:12,139
climbing into my eyes. I just, I just slapped and grabbed him through. I'm not going to look down.

1042
03:17:21,219 --> 03:17:27,750
You promised a mechanics. Oh, all right. Do that next. 73. It's not going to go up any higher.

1043
03:17:27,750 --> 03:17:44,420
I don't think. Time for Steve's. Let's go. Go 70. I want 75k. I need to, I have to see it. 70.

1044
03:17:44,420 --> 03:18:01,500
No, fuck it. I don't care. All right. 73,000 coins. We are looking for a new area. There's

1045
03:18:01,500 --> 03:18:17,319
the void. And then there's 990,000 of these potions, whatever that is. Okay. So upgrade,

1046
03:18:17,319 --> 03:18:23,319
auto-upgrade trees. Let's get it. Auto-upgrade fertilizer. Get it. Auto-upgrade marketing. Get

1047
03:18:23,319 --> 03:18:33,370
it. Auto-upgrade nuclear. Get it. Buy everything. Buy everything. Auto-unlock flasks. Buy them.

1048
03:18:35,059 --> 03:18:44,729
Add a bunch of printers. Add multipliers to those printers. Increase that converter count.

1049
03:18:45,370 --> 03:18:57,979
Increase the converter output. Prestige. More coins. More leaves. Come on. I ran out of money.

1050
03:18:57,979 --> 03:19:22,569
Give me the leaf portal. I want it. All right. We're already at 2000 coins.

1051
03:19:24,299 --> 03:19:51,770
Okay. Mechanicus. Mechanicus OST. There you go. 72 hour time travel. The game's running for three

1052
03:19:51,770 --> 03:20:06,969
days. Why do I want to buy the pack to do that? Just see what happens. All right. I got the

1053
03:20:06,969 --> 03:20:24,489
converters going. Get them started. Let's go. Boot them up. Turners going. Boot them up. All right.

1054
03:20:24,489 --> 03:20:40,500
We need more combos. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. What is the potions? Green flasks.

1055
03:20:42,250 --> 03:21:06,090
Science research? What? How do I make a flask? Is it voids? Oh, red flasks. I have the auto leaf

1056
03:21:06,090 --> 03:21:13,899
buying going on, right? Yeah, I do. Yeah. Everything is on auto-buy right now. I just have to collect.

1057
03:21:14,940 --> 03:21:19,500
I have to collect and watch this number. It's already at 15,000. Holy shit. Okay.

1058
03:21:19,500 --> 03:21:40,149
Maybe should I get to like two 500,000 for that? A million? It's a 900k? What's the next? All right.

1059
03:21:40,149 --> 03:21:49,620
It's 500 red potions for the next upgrade. They didn't make a potion though. I feel like it would

1060
03:21:49,620 --> 03:22:02,170
be here. Unlock red flasks. Did they just show up? You buy them from the potion seller. Unlock a

1061
03:22:02,170 --> 03:22:29,559
green flask. It says converter under it. Converter. Let's go. Reduce. Doubles the resource input output

1062
03:22:29,559 --> 03:22:42,500
for all converters. Oh man. All leaves plus 20%. Holy fuck. Okay. 20% per level. Reduce the converter

1063
03:22:42,500 --> 03:23:00,760
cost. Increase the output. Increase everything. Make it all huge. 495 million. Oh Jesus. Okay.

1064
03:23:00,760 --> 03:23:16,059
Hold on. Reaching leaf end game? Maybe. When you can play meat. You guys keep trying to get me to

1065
03:23:16,059 --> 03:23:22,649
say that and I'm not going to say it. You guys keep trying to get me to say meat, the meat and

1066
03:23:22,649 --> 03:23:35,540
something. Game. Oh, I don't know what it is, but whatever. Alien turbine. Where did you get this?

1067
03:23:35,540 --> 03:23:48,549
That's pretty good. This is a big blue popsicle stick. Geez. It's getting, all right. It's getting

1068
03:23:48,549 --> 03:23:59,370
kind of hard to manage. Look at all these achievements. It's a popsicle. It won't say

1069
03:23:59,370 --> 03:24:08,940
meat and fuck, but we'll say fuck and learn. No, I said fucking learn. Like as an adjective,

1070
03:24:08,940 --> 03:24:27,129
like you need to fucking learn. I already have 50k. I'm going to get this to at least 500,000.

1071
03:24:27,129 --> 03:24:40,459
At the very least. I just love clicking stuff. All right. We got, hold on. Green flasks have

1072
03:24:40,459 --> 03:24:50,620
been purchased. Where's the converter? Start converting green flasks. Oh gee. Unlock blue

1073
03:24:50,620 --> 03:25:06,739
flasks. All leaves plus fucking 50, 100%. More converter output. More. Um, what is this? Buy.

1074
03:25:07,459 --> 03:25:12,020
Ace of spades. If you'd like to blow leaves, I tell you you're, I'm your man. Going with the blow.

1075
03:25:12,020 --> 03:25:22,680
It's all a game to me. I am the ace of spades. Wait, is that the?

1076
03:25:27,959 --> 03:25:46,059
The same to me, right? That's also from Tony Hawk. That's a great game.

1077
03:25:46,780 --> 03:26:01,379
Back, back, back, back. Okay. Uh, more converter damage, more output, more leaves. I think

1078
03:26:02,180 --> 03:26:11,670
we're about to cross where we just stopped. 75 K a slime rancher. I do have to play slime

1079
03:26:11,670 --> 03:26:31,459
rancher. You're right. You don't just fucking just skip 30 minutes. Yep. 225 K blue flasks are open

1080
03:26:32,180 --> 03:26:42,899
all leaves, all leaves. All right. Blue. I need the converter. We need to do blue flasks

1081
03:26:43,540 --> 03:26:52,219
now that we have blue at magenta flasks. What the fuck? This is just, this is too much. There's

1082
03:26:52,219 --> 03:27:00,469
too many like compounding things to touch. I feel like we've listened to the same song for like an

1083
03:27:00,469 --> 03:27:25,780
hour. This is dark night music. Not anymore. Okay. Blue flasks, more, less resources, more

1084
03:27:25,860 --> 03:27:34,010
leaves. Let's go to magenta. Convert to magenta. Unlock orange flasks.

1085
03:27:35,750 --> 03:27:49,829
But we can't. How many are there? I need more blue flasks. I need more output on the converters.

1086
03:27:56,889 --> 03:28:19,100
God, 250 K. Should I? Oh, was it half a million? Blowfish. Uh, okay. Cool. A graphics card?

1087
03:28:19,739 --> 03:28:35,030
An overclocked graphics card with a large fan. Okay. I need orange flasks. Where was it? The

1088
03:28:35,030 --> 03:28:47,450
bottom of the list, by the way. Unlock black flasks. Um, unlock big leaf crunch. Unlock

1089
03:28:47,450 --> 03:29:10,950
the big leaf crunch. Okay. I need more. I don't have enough. Reduce the resources and make the

1090
03:29:10,950 --> 03:29:23,829
output bigger. The end of everything. The big leaf crunch met 358,000 by the way. Prestige now.

1091
03:29:24,809 --> 03:29:37,420
Hold on. Not yet. I need to see what it looks like. Does the converter look like? The converter

1092
03:29:37,420 --> 03:29:46,069
has to be better. I have to prestige the converter. Yeah, let's go. I'm out. Like 990 K. I can't even.

1093
03:29:46,069 --> 03:29:56,170
What kind of potion is that? I don't have any of those. That's like a yellow and red potion.

1094
03:29:56,729 --> 03:30:09,959
All right. What's the next OST? All right. I'm, I'm doing it. I'm pressing the button.

1095
03:30:10,600 --> 03:30:17,899
I'm going to press the button really soon here. I'm going to buy max on everything,

1096
03:30:17,899 --> 03:30:34,889
run around in a circle for a minute and then we're going for it. All right. Let's do it.

1097
03:30:34,889 --> 03:30:42,889
What do you think? 400,000? Oh, pluck. Right. People were looking for pluck.

1098
03:30:50,180 --> 03:31:15,399
Here we go. Prestige. All right. Now this is very important. I have 370,000 coins.

1099
03:31:18,500 --> 03:31:22,760
Cannot buy a new area. All right. The printers need to be better.

1100
03:31:25,299 --> 03:31:34,899
Leaf printer. Let's get this up to like 2K or so. Okay. I need way more of these.

1101
03:31:40,680 --> 03:31:50,969
Void leaf printer. Okay. What are these? Now converters. I need better converters.

1102
03:31:54,059 --> 03:32:02,979
My money. Printer. One printer added. Printer multiplier. Increase converter count.

1103
03:32:05,799 --> 03:32:14,629
Where's reduce? All printers. All printers. Get better. Increase the converter count.

1104
03:32:15,190 --> 03:32:27,430
Increase converter output. Oops. All upgrade discount. Oh, that's expensive.

1105
03:32:29,989 --> 03:32:46,170
More void leaves. More everything. More money. More leaves. More printer multipliers.

1106
03:32:49,079 --> 03:33:12,920
Hell yeah. Oh, hell yeah. Oh, man. Look at that number crawling up already. All right.

1107
03:33:14,379 --> 03:33:26,549
Let's get started here. Turn on the converters. One, two, turn them. Start them off. Whoa.

1108
03:33:30,969 --> 03:33:53,000
Okay. They're on. Converters are on. How come they're green? Where's my potions? It takes years.

1109
03:33:53,639 --> 03:34:08,219
Shouldn't.

1110
03:34:14,459 --> 03:34:27,860
What do the apples even do? Reduce those resources, dude.

1111
03:34:28,659 --> 03:34:38,569
Reduce the resources. Reduce the resources. Increase the output. More leaves.

1112
03:34:39,989 --> 03:34:49,879
Oh, I love it. More leaves. More leaves. I'm turning into Jerry Seinfeld. What the hell am I doing?

1113
03:35:00,409 --> 03:35:07,540
More. That's going up even higher now. What was that? 300? Let's try to get to a million.

1114
03:35:08,260 --> 03:35:13,100
Put on DuckTales OST? Yeah, that's way better than. Well, that's not way better than Pluck,

1115
03:35:13,100 --> 03:35:24,090
but that's a way better idea from me. That's way better from me. We have to skip the first one.

1116
03:35:24,649 --> 03:35:53,739
All right, we're good here. They should be in Smash Brothers. This is fucking stupid. He should

1117
03:35:53,739 --> 03:35:59,670
be there. Scrooge McDuck should be in Smash Brothers. Think about the songs. The remixes

1118
03:35:59,670 --> 03:36:07,110
they would have in that. I don't care if it's been Disney. I don't. It's like a classic Nintendo

1119
03:36:07,110 --> 03:36:11,270
game that everybody knows. If you've opened up a fucking console and put a disc in it,

1120
03:36:11,909 --> 03:36:17,909
you know the DuckTales game. You don't think they could do it. Look at the moveset. It would

1121
03:36:17,909 --> 03:36:23,670
be amazing. You could do like the... You could bounce around and be down B. It could even be

1122
03:36:23,670 --> 03:36:30,469
recovery. Whatever. You do the golf club side B. The gems. He has the little diamonds he could

1123
03:36:30,469 --> 03:36:36,709
throw out like a standard B. Oh, it's Disney. I don't like Disney. Well, it's a classic Nintendo

1124
03:36:36,709 --> 03:36:59,260
game. I don't care already. It's not about liking Disney. Disney would never agree to it.

1125
03:37:02,780 --> 03:37:09,940
I don't understand. Think about a bunch of classic Nintendo games that required

1126
03:37:11,260 --> 03:37:17,079
Disney to be on board. Think about all the Mickey Mouse games, all the Donald Duck cameos that were

1127
03:37:17,079 --> 03:37:23,139
in fucking Nintendo games. It was like a hundred fucking Disney games, like Mickey Mouse games

1128
03:37:25,059 --> 03:37:29,370
on regular Nintendo and Super Nintendo. But now all of a sudden they don't want to be put in video

1129
03:37:29,370 --> 03:37:42,870
games anymore. I can name you at least like 10 Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck goofy video games

1130
03:37:42,870 --> 03:37:45,829
that were on Nintendo and Super Nintendo. And now that is what? You have to be part of Kingdom

1131
03:37:45,829 --> 03:37:59,319
Hearts now? Do it right now. Fine. Fine. Let me just think for a minute. Magical Quest starring

1132
03:37:59,319 --> 03:38:06,819
Mickey Mouse. Mickey Mousecapade. The Great Circus Mystery starring Mickey and Minnie. Mickey Mania.

1133
03:38:08,090 --> 03:38:12,010
Adventures in the Magic Kingdom. And this is just Mickey Mouse, by the way.

1134
03:38:12,010 --> 03:38:23,450
Plus we have Mickey's Adventure in Numberland. Mickey's Safari in Letterland. Disney's Magical

1135
03:38:23,450 --> 03:38:27,930
Quest 3. That means there's a 2. Legend of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse. Mickey's Ultimate

1136
03:38:27,930 --> 03:38:34,709
Challenge. Mickey's Dangerous Chase. Mickey No Tokyo Disneyland. Donald in the Magic Cap.

1137
03:38:38,069 --> 03:38:52,600
There's like 50 of these. Donald in the Magic Cap. What is it for? Donald Duck No Maho No Boshi.

1138
03:38:52,600 --> 03:39:01,670
Disney Wiki is what this sounds like. Donald Duck in the Magical Hat and the Magic Cap was

1139
03:39:01,670 --> 03:39:07,670
released for Nintendo Super Famicom by Epoc in Japan only in 1995. Starting Donald Duck with

1140
03:39:07,670 --> 03:39:15,610
guest appearances by Daisy Duck, Pete, Grandma Duck, Butch the Bulldog, and Goofy as the announcer.

1141
03:39:15,610 --> 03:39:31,579
Why do they not make video games anymore? What happened to the music? They do. What was the last

1142
03:39:31,579 --> 03:39:36,780
Mickey Mouse video game that wasn't Kingdom Hearts? And by the way, I don't count Kingdom Hearts.

1143
03:39:36,860 --> 03:39:46,180
That's not a Mickey Mouse game. That's not like you control Mickey Mouse and jump around.

1144
03:39:46,180 --> 03:40:02,069
They made Epic Mickey like 12 years ago. Epic Mickey was shit. You can control Mickey in 2.

1145
03:40:04,760 --> 03:40:14,840
Epic Mickey came out for the Wii in like 2009 or something. Yeah, you can control. Yes, yes,

1146
03:40:14,840 --> 03:40:22,600
yes, sure. Spoiler alert. In Kingdom Hearts 2, if you have it on like easy mode, if you turn the

1147
03:40:22,600 --> 03:40:36,899
difficulty down, you like can't lose because something happens and like somebody comes and

1148
03:40:36,899 --> 03:40:45,340
like just make sure you don't lose because and they made them all like Jedi's. I don't know.

1149
03:40:45,340 --> 03:41:00,090
I don't understand it. Stop talking. It's not even, what is, how is that a spoiler? How do I

1150
03:41:00,090 --> 03:41:05,850
know this? I play, what? You don't think I played Kingdom Hearts 1? Holy shit. All right, I gotta

1151
03:41:05,850 --> 03:41:15,420
focus. Let's do, how about Magical Quest starring Mickey Mouse OST. By the way, this game is

1152
03:41:15,420 --> 03:41:29,420
incredible. All the old Disney games are really, really good. All right, I need some converters

1153
03:41:29,420 --> 03:41:42,059
going here. They are going already. Produce those resources. Make it more. I want more stuff. I'm

1154
03:41:42,059 --> 03:42:12,309
pissed off. Green leaf converter. I'm gonna say, all right. Play, pray, devils make, never cry.

1155
03:42:18,149 --> 03:42:26,010
Mouse is gonna get you. Mickey Mouse is gonna get me for playing the OST for a game that's like

1156
03:42:26,010 --> 03:42:52,489
30 years old. Yes. Really? Mickey has no forgiveness in his heart. He's just evil.

1157
03:42:53,049 --> 03:43:00,680
I'll just buy one of these. I've been playing this for like four hours. Holy shit.

1158
03:43:09,379 --> 03:43:24,940
Upgrade your leaves. Pepe mad. Upgrade your leaves. Pepe mad. All right, let's do it. Four,

1159
03:43:29,909 --> 03:43:59,510
five, six, more, seven, D. God damn it. I need more of this shit. Come on. All right, G. Here we go.

1160
03:44:04,069 --> 03:44:17,940
H. Orange flasks. Not yet. All right, we're at 200,000. Payday two. No, what else we got?

1161
03:44:17,940 --> 03:44:30,379
Remember, don't big leaf crunch. It sucks and made me want to cry. Oh, sorry. Turtles in time.

1162
03:44:31,020 --> 03:44:36,979
That's a classic. You're flushing a bunch of flasks down the drain, am I?

1163
03:44:37,620 --> 03:44:47,030
Rollercoaster Tycoon 3. Play it. It's so good. I have this weird memory where I played Rollercoaster

1164
03:44:47,030 --> 03:44:54,229
Tycoon 2 on stream. Did I play Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 on stream? I don't think I have. I made a video

1165
03:44:54,229 --> 03:45:25,059
on it. I don't remember. Do the arcade OST. Is it different? This is higher quality. This is fantastic.

1166
03:45:25,059 --> 03:45:37,290
What is this? Turtles in time arcade soundtrack. Okay.

1167
03:45:53,459 --> 03:45:58,899
Sounds like worse than though. Let's see. Okay. Big Apple 3 AM is a really good indicator if the

1168
03:45:58,899 --> 03:46:24,809
SNES version is better. I mean it. SNES one's better. That's much better. I would put that.

1169
03:46:25,770 --> 03:46:38,739
I would have to say it's way better. Let's see. Oh yeah. That's way better.

1170
03:46:42,729 --> 03:46:44,010
The trumpets are way more prevalent.

1171
03:47:00,329 --> 03:47:14,940
Big Apple. I feel like this just fits everywhere. It's so good. It goes everywhere. My toe. My toe.

1172
03:47:20,059 --> 03:47:45,020
You're 78. All right. I need to get at least a million. I beat this game probably a hundred

1173
03:47:45,020 --> 03:47:56,629
times. We've already talked about it. Where the fuck is the narrow toe OST? Why would I play the

1174
03:47:56,629 --> 03:48:18,340
narrow toe OST right now? That's just. That's DMCA. That's just songs. Come on. 300k. Come on.

1175
03:48:18,340 --> 03:48:24,149
More green. Converters create more output resource. Increase converted output by one for the current.

1176
03:48:25,190 --> 03:48:49,559
This is a good one too. I love this one. Remember your red flashes. Holy shit. What? What? What is

1177
03:48:49,559 --> 03:49:04,010
it? I got tons of these. I need more output from. I need more output from here. From red. I need more

1178
03:49:04,010 --> 03:49:18,059
red. Stop converting. What do you mean stop converting? Why? Turn off the flash. Red flash

1179
03:49:18,059 --> 03:49:46,520
converter. Why would I do that? Finally. What? Don't convert until you upgrade red. All right.

1180
03:49:46,520 --> 03:50:04,659
I got you. What's my favorite one? Technodrome. I love the train and I love prehistoric turtle

1181
03:50:04,659 --> 03:50:24,389
source. This is a good one. I love this part because it's the guys that charge. They just

1182
03:50:24,389 --> 03:50:39,500
run straight at you. Now how are we doing on red? We're doing really good on red. All right. More.

1183
03:50:40,219 --> 03:50:54,889
That's good. Where's the skull and crossbones? No, not that one. There it is. Oh, this is a

1184
03:50:54,889 --> 03:51:18,340
classic Jerva making my day worse. This is one of the train, right? What was the alligator's name

1185
03:51:18,899 --> 03:51:33,290
in Ninja Turtles? What's his name? Leatherhead, right? Leatherhead, right? I forgot about

1186
03:51:33,290 --> 03:51:39,819
Leatherhead. Oh, Neon Knight Riders is awesome too. This whole thing is awesome. This is a really

1187
03:51:39,819 --> 03:52:03,110
good game. Just about to cross. Scream it. Yeah. I should just scream it and beat it. You want to

1188
03:52:03,110 --> 03:52:18,569
have a nostalgia scream where I beat turtles in time like three times? All right. Turn it on.

1189
03:52:18,569 --> 03:52:39,290
Let's get green going. You cowered it out after dying once in the retro scream last week. You

1190
03:52:39,290 --> 03:52:46,149
think you can beat it three times? Well, I mean, that's a little different. The retro scream was

1191
03:52:46,149 --> 03:52:56,059
there were 620 games on that box. I needed time. I wasn't going to give every second dedicated to

1192
03:52:56,059 --> 03:53:10,469
Ninja Turtles. It was like 600 fucking games on that thing. All right. How are we doing on green?

1193
03:53:11,270 --> 03:53:21,610
More. I forgot about that. Where no turtle has gone before. And let me tell you something about

1194
03:53:21,610 --> 03:53:32,489
the Shredder, okay? Super strong, super powerful, has a cool group. I'm not going to do that again,

1195
03:53:32,489 --> 03:53:46,170
no way. All right. 55,000. Almost time. Almost time to just absolutely let this just fly off.

1196
03:53:48,280 --> 03:54:06,870
Want more converter count? For Shredder Synth. The boss theme. Let's get that going.

1197
03:54:11,639 --> 03:54:27,209
I love doing the Shredder. Let's take my favorite thing. Get into it. I need one million.

1198
03:54:41,989 --> 03:54:49,370
All right. Let's turn on the blue. Coming up next. We've got blue. I know you're all

1199
03:54:49,370 --> 03:55:02,059
so excited for it. Once this crosses like 50k. Here it is. Turn on the blue.

1200
03:55:02,059 --> 03:55:24,809
Blue. Devils never cry. Let's see. What's the versus mode one? That song was good too,

1201
03:55:24,809 --> 03:55:40,819
wasn't it? Yeah, here it is. This is a great song. Not this one. It's the one right after this.

1202
03:55:51,540 --> 03:56:27,399
This is the one I like. If that's 10. Devil will cry. Got a link. What do we got this time?

1203
03:56:27,399 --> 03:56:34,520
What do we got this time? Joe Biden will erase a billion dollars off the debt. If you stream

1204
03:56:34,520 --> 03:56:56,020
Bionicle Mask of Light. What does this picture do? Why is it Joe Biden? Joe Biden will erase

1205
03:56:56,020 --> 03:57:02,489
a billion off the debt. The nation is watching. Germany, do our country proud. J-Dog from Joe

1206
03:57:02,489 --> 03:57:09,530
Biden. Stream Bionicle Mask of Light. It's free on YouTube. Lego will not DMCA you. They allow

1207
03:57:09,530 --> 03:57:26,649
the movie to have free online distribution. What? This is a movie? You want to watch this movie?

1208
03:57:26,649 --> 03:57:38,620
Okay. All right. Fine. I'm going to look into this. I will stream Bionicle Mask of Light

1209
03:57:40,790 --> 03:57:46,260
on a stream coming up soon. Probably in the next week. Is this for real?

1210
03:57:50,579 --> 03:58:01,370
Do it right now. Should we get a pull for this? That's a pretty significant amount of money.

1211
03:58:01,370 --> 03:58:20,379
This is just a simple yes or no. Is it? Okay. One billion off the debt if Bionicle

1212
03:58:22,280 --> 03:58:46,139
Movie stream. Okay. Here we go. I didn't vote. How much do we have for current? We're at four

1213
03:58:46,139 --> 03:59:07,180
billion right now currently. 92%. Holy shit. Well, I think we have a deal. This is a landslide.

1214
03:59:13,670 --> 03:59:23,579
This is Joe Biden that's going to do this. All right. That's unanimous. That's 90%.

1215
03:59:24,620 --> 03:59:30,389
All right. Let's go. Let's do it. Not now. But at some point, one of the next streams that you

1216
03:59:30,389 --> 03:59:37,219
see on this channel is going to be Bionicle Mask of Light streamed movie stream. If that's actually

1217
03:59:37,219 --> 03:59:46,100
true and I can do that. If I can truly actually stream that movie, I will. I got to look into that.

1218
03:59:48,379 --> 04:00:05,860
Hey, thanks a lot, Joe Biden. All right. What are we doing? Oh, I get to look at all my money.

1219
04:00:06,739 --> 04:00:15,059
I got to turn on the purple now. What's this? Oh shit. Perfect. Yeah. I'm keeping this on.

1220
04:00:15,860 --> 04:00:39,860
It's Mega Man X. All right. This one's ready to go. I have so much blue. I'll go too crazy with that.

1221
04:00:43,879 --> 04:01:01,100
I got to get these all 10. All right. Hold on. Let's get it to 10. You have to get Joe Biden

1222
04:01:01,100 --> 04:01:19,719
on the stream to watch it with you. I don't think that would. I don't think that's going to happen.

1223
04:01:19,719 --> 04:01:26,360
I'm sorry to say that would clear the debt. That would undo. I don't know. That's not going to

1224
04:01:26,360 --> 04:01:39,670
happen. It went to the part when like the Bionicles are about to lose. Oh, come on, man.

1225
04:01:41,000 --> 04:01:51,559
No, this is this is malarkey. I hate everything about this. I know Joe is fucked up. Hey,

1226
04:01:51,559 --> 04:02:10,260
watch that language, please. I'm sorry, Joe. I mean, Mr. Biden, President Biden, Mr. President,

1227
04:02:10,260 --> 04:02:15,379
Mr. President Biden, Mr. Biden, please. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say those swear words.

1228
04:02:16,360 --> 04:02:23,770
That's OK. But here's the deal. You say one more of those swear words, we're going to have a big

1229
04:02:23,770 --> 04:02:44,139
problem. He says Bill Clinton. I'm trying to enjoy my gosh darn. I just made him say my swear.

1230
04:02:56,809 --> 04:03:02,649
I just keep being like the Bionicles. Oh, Joe, Joe, the Bionicles are never going to make it.

1231
04:03:02,649 --> 04:03:07,290
I don't think they're going to make it, Joe. Chad, what do you guys think? Will you just shut up,

1232
04:03:07,290 --> 04:03:21,579
man? What? Trying to watch the movie here. Yeah, of course they're going to make it.

1233
04:03:22,709 --> 04:03:41,399
They're the damn Bionicles. Now hear me. How much do I have? Oh, five hundred and eighty two K,

1234
04:03:41,399 --> 04:03:54,309
Joe. Can you believe it? Biden onicle. All right. It's time to turn on the orange ones.

1235
04:04:00,819 --> 04:04:19,209
More, more, more, more money, money, money, money, money. Bidenicle. Actually might be kind of funny

1236
04:04:19,209 --> 04:04:25,209
just to have like a few Joe Biden clips of him just telling me to stop talking and enjoying

1237
04:04:25,209 --> 04:04:33,350
something, being like, oh, this great. Wow. I'm going to watch Bionicle with Joe Biden.

1238
04:04:33,989 --> 04:04:44,379
Just have a bunch of soundboard here of him enjoying the movie with me.

1239
04:04:46,920 --> 04:04:58,969
I mean, that's kind of a layer there. Iron impersonator. And we have a cam on in the same

1240
04:04:58,969 --> 04:05:10,709
room. No, but then the real Joe Biden has to open the door and be like, what are you doing in here?

1241
04:05:11,510 --> 04:05:21,379
And then the audience track has to be like, and he looks side to side and they don't stop clapping

1242
04:05:21,379 --> 04:05:26,500
and he's waiting. He's smiling. Yeah, it's me, the real Joe Biden. Not a comedy here.

1243
04:05:27,770 --> 04:05:35,399
And like two full minutes go by. All the actors on stage are all looking around waiting for it.

1244
04:05:35,479 --> 04:05:42,870
Yeah, it's Saturday Night Live. Yep. And then he just simply goes like, this is malarkey.

1245
04:05:44,229 --> 04:05:48,629
Everybody's fucking screams, class, everybody smiles back and forth. And then he just leaves.

1246
04:05:54,600 --> 04:06:00,709
It is getting him to do two things. And then, no, no, no, no. Then they all crowd together

1247
04:06:00,709 --> 04:06:03,829
and they're all trying to wait for each other to cue each other to say like live from New York

1248
04:06:03,829 --> 04:06:08,389
at Saturday night. And they all mess it up. So it's like, because Joe Biden is not like an actor or

1249
04:06:08,389 --> 04:06:14,149
anything. So he leans in and he's like, it goes something like this every time. No, not like that.

1250
04:06:18,549 --> 04:06:28,809
Live from New York, it's Saturday night. Live from New York, it's Saturday night. Live from

1251
04:06:28,809 --> 04:06:35,690
New York, it's Saturday night. And this is what happens. All right, everyone's clapping, everyone's

1252
04:06:35,690 --> 04:06:47,579
clapping. Live from New York, it's Saturday night. They never get it right. They never get it perfect.

1253
04:06:48,139 --> 04:07:02,440
They got to work on that. Get to a million. Upgrade the other flask. Oh shit.

1254
04:07:05,930 --> 04:07:15,979
Wait, is this on? Is this shit on? I can't. Oh, it is okay. All right. I need to upgrade these.

1255
04:07:16,540 --> 04:07:23,299
All right. Do I turn on? It's time to. Whoa, what's going on here? What's going on here? What's

1256
04:07:23,299 --> 04:07:38,569
going on with the red one? What happened here? Turn that off for a second. Five plus minute

1257
04:07:38,569 --> 04:07:49,819
political bias joke. Wait, what? Talking about Joe Biden watching Bionicle with me?

1258
04:07:50,620 --> 04:08:34,920
Turn it back on. Turn it on. Oh, Big Leaf Crunch is activated. Liberal Straver. We ain't getting

1259
04:08:34,920 --> 04:08:53,139
into this. Oh, strange flask. All right, stop. Omega Low. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

1260
04:08:53,139 --> 04:08:58,659
No political talk unless we're making jokes about the way that. Unless we're making Saturday night

1261
04:08:58,659 --> 04:09:07,399
live themed jokes. Here's the only political talk we have on this channel. Excuse me. Excuse me.

1262
04:09:08,040 --> 04:09:20,840
That and. You just shut up, man. That's like the extent of the political talk on this channel.

1263
04:09:21,639 --> 04:09:28,620
It's me just putting my hands up and going. Excuse me. Excuse me. That's it. That's all I've ever

1264
04:09:28,620 --> 04:09:51,129
done. Or I've ordered like fake hamburgers as Bernie Sanders. Mitch McConnell. Yeah, but is

1265
04:09:51,129 --> 04:09:59,829
that political talk or is that me doing impressions of public figures? I mean that guy's a dick.

1266
04:10:00,309 --> 04:10:33,620
Let's be honest. I need 999,000 of these. Oh, he's getting political politics. We care about

1267
04:10:33,620 --> 04:10:40,420
Bionicle. Yeah, that's what really matters is the Bionicle mask of the mask, whatever it was.

1268
04:10:40,979 --> 04:10:59,459
Stream. All right, I need to upgrade this once because I need 999,000 of these. He's a registered

1269
04:10:59,459 --> 04:11:10,969
Bionicle. That sounds odd. That sounds bad to say that. That sounds weird. I don't. OK, but

1270
04:11:13,989 --> 04:11:22,260
registered like I got millions of these things.

1271
04:11:33,579 --> 04:11:37,340
I'm fucking this up. Hold on. I got it. This is very precise. I cannot mess this up.

1272
04:11:46,020 --> 04:11:53,370
Oh, Jesus. OK, I can't. I don't want to mess this up. Stop. Stop. I already screwed it up.

1273
04:11:53,370 --> 04:11:58,409
All right, I need nine. Wait, enter the big leaf crunch portal to restart your blowing adventure

1274
04:11:58,409 --> 04:12:07,319
with some BLC coins. What? I don't want to crunch. No, I don't want to do that.

1275
04:12:08,040 --> 04:12:23,559
Grease can drop exotic leaves. I'm going to start converting these. 292,000 gets you 700 of these.

1276
04:12:23,559 --> 04:12:49,030
I need 900,000 of these. Oh, Jesus. I need prestige. Let's go. Wait, a drill fan is the highest

1277
04:12:49,030 --> 04:12:55,610
thing I can get a fan. Use crunch. Use crunch. Don't prestige. Use crunch. Use crunch. Crunch it.

1278
04:12:56,250 --> 04:13:11,159
A crunch. I'm going to crunch. I'm going to crunch. But again, I've got one crunch coin.

1279
04:13:15,290 --> 04:13:23,209
Grease prestige coins reward by 200% per level. Holy shit, that's insane.

1280
04:13:23,850 --> 04:13:40,149
Grease the combo multiplier by 200%. Coin upgrade bought. What happened? Wait, actually reset it?

1281
04:13:40,149 --> 04:13:46,170
What do you mean? Actually reset? Wait, wait, wait. Hold on a minute. Somebody just said

1282
04:13:46,170 --> 04:14:01,129
actually reset Omega L and I remember their name popped up. They said do it. Crunch it. What? New

1283
04:14:01,129 --> 04:14:13,719
deal. I don't even know where I start with this. I don't even know where to start with this.

1284
04:14:15,350 --> 04:14:19,750
New deal. If you can get a Biden impersonator to watch the whole Bionicle movie with you with

1285
04:14:19,750 --> 04:14:23,829
camera on for the whole stream, the entire debt will be wiped. Don't waste this chance.

1286
04:14:29,370 --> 04:14:34,040
I'm seeing a lot of no deals though. I'm seeing a lot of no deals.

1287
04:14:46,329 --> 04:14:52,920
It has to be the real Joe Biden. Well, that's not going to happen. We can have a fun little talk

1288
04:14:52,920 --> 04:15:03,909
here of like, oh, that's funny. That's never going to be a reality. Make it a reality.

1289
04:15:04,940 --> 04:15:13,100
No. Okay. For that to be a thing, they would have to be... I think I got to have like 200,000

1290
04:15:13,100 --> 04:15:19,780
concurrent viewers. I got to be a 200k Andy for that to even be considered. That's not going to

1291
04:15:19,780 --> 04:15:40,059
happen. All right. No, that's not going to happen. He responded. Well, of course I'll watch the

1292
04:15:40,059 --> 04:15:47,799
Bionicle movie with German added by... Oh my God. No, we'll keep it the way it is for now.

1293
04:15:52,840 --> 04:15:57,159
All right. Did I really fuck this whole thing up? Is it time to... Is it end of the stream

1294
04:15:57,159 --> 04:16:23,450
voice right now? Don't leave us. I can't wait to watch Bionicle. Realistically, Jeremy,

1295
04:16:23,450 --> 04:16:26,729
who do you think is the highest ranking member of the government that has ever seen one of

1296
04:16:26,729 --> 04:16:32,700
your streams or videos? I mean, it's got to be... It's probably going to be something like

1297
04:16:32,700 --> 04:16:37,670
some random like selectmen. You know what I mean? It's got to be... It's probably like the

1298
04:16:38,709 --> 04:16:42,709
local like treasury secretary or something in like Nevada. I don't know. It's probably

1299
04:16:42,709 --> 04:16:55,780
somebody like the local level. It was definitely Dave State. All right. I think I kind of think

1300
04:16:55,780 --> 04:17:03,290
I'm going to call it here. Wanted to stop by for like four or five hours. I'm still in the

1301
04:17:03,290 --> 04:17:07,930
middle of doing a lot of things. I will have a shitload of announcements for you guys very soon.

1302
04:17:09,420 --> 04:17:15,180
There's at least one or two announcements and big things that we're going to talk about this next

1303
04:17:15,180 --> 04:17:26,469
week. Delay Danny, delay Darryl, break Andy. I'm going to go back to it. I will see you guys.

1304
04:17:26,469 --> 04:17:35,940
The next stream will probably end up being either probably Wednesday, Wednesday or Thursday. Keep

1305
04:17:35,940 --> 04:17:42,940
an eye on the ground. But I didn't want to just disappear. I wanted to come back and at least hang

1306
04:17:42,940 --> 04:17:49,020
out for a little while. So when I come back though, we got a lot to talk about. A lot to talk about.

1307
04:17:51,420 --> 04:17:55,500
Thanks for watching, as always. And I look forward to the Bionicle movie stream

1308
04:17:56,139 --> 04:18:02,120
next week. This game was actually pretty fun. I did not think there was going to be this much

1309
04:18:02,120 --> 04:18:10,809
in this game. It's a good background game. I recommend it. Is this game free? I think this

1310
04:18:10,809 --> 04:18:22,760
game is free. Is it free? It might be. I think it is. Yeah, I think the game is free. Cool.

1311
04:18:22,760 --> 04:18:33,700
It's free. So just go grab it if you want to check it out. A leaf blower revolution, leaf blower

1312
04:18:34,340 --> 04:18:46,889
revolution. All right. We are going to... What are we going to do? We are going to go. We're going

1313
04:18:46,889 --> 04:18:52,360
to raid. Who are we going to raid? Let's see. Who have we not raided in a while?

1314
04:19:10,920 --> 04:19:21,659
Let's raid Boxbox. It's been a long time. Boxbox is playing poker right now. I saw the gambling

1315
04:19:21,659 --> 04:19:26,940
and I immediately said, okay, let's go. I see poker. I see like blackjack. I see slot machines.

1316
04:19:26,940 --> 04:19:41,049
Let's go. Go say hello to Boxbox. Hey, tell them German985 sent you. Let's do the credits first,

1317
04:19:41,049 --> 04:19:51,850
though. Of course. Again, thanks for watching. Kind of just a chill stream today. Playing an

1318
04:19:51,850 --> 04:19:57,860
idle game. I'll see you guys on probably Wednesday. Keep an eye on the sus. It might change the

1319
04:19:57,860 --> 04:20:07,770
Thursday. Thanks again for your community subs. Everybody that's subbing and everyone that's

1320
04:20:07,770 --> 04:20:14,629
given money. I know a lot of people have given lots of money. Even today, too. Just huge, huge

1321
04:20:14,629 --> 04:20:21,989
money drops. I appreciate it. Thank you. We had massive, massive raids today. Kitboga came in

1322
04:20:21,989 --> 04:20:29,049
earlier. We had Five Up came in. Fundy came in. We had like 30,000 people come in over the course

1323
04:20:29,049 --> 04:20:34,709
of the four and a half hours here. If you stuck around from those raids, and also from Nice Beaver,

1324
04:20:34,709 --> 04:20:43,819
too. If you stuck around, cool. Glad to have you. We'll see you again. If not, thanks for dropping

1325
04:20:43,819 --> 04:20:59,930
in. Thanks for parachuting down into the base. And we'll maybe see you soon. Parachute.

1326
04:21:01,860 --> 04:21:11,139
Yeah, it's a raid. They're parachuting in. So many subs. Holy shit. I know. That's insane.

1327
04:21:11,700 --> 04:21:28,979
It's so many people. Are you thanking people that are not here? Oh, you don't know that. German985

1328
04:21:28,979 --> 04:21:33,500
sent me. Oh, you don't know that. Somebody may have stuck around. At least one person.

1329
04:21:34,219 --> 04:21:47,129
Let's get the raid queued up for Boxbox. Go say hello. And maybe give me a few tips from this

1330
04:21:47,129 --> 04:21:56,020
poker game. Thanks for watching, guys. We'll see you probably Wednesday or Thursday next week.

1331
04:21:56,579 --> 04:22:00,739
Lots of announcements. Lots of things to talk about this coming week. I can't wait to tell you.

1332
04:22:00,739 --> 04:22:07,819
You're going to be like, holy shit. Good night, guys. See you soon.
