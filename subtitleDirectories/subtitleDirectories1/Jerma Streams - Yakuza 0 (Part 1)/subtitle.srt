1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:21,640
Hello. Hi, everybody. Oh, it's muted Marty. Muted Marty. No, I'm here. I'm ready to play a video

2
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:27,059
game called Yakuza Zero. And I'll give you a couple of quick things before we get started.

3
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:31,539
Reason why I wasn't live yesterday is because I want to be completely transparent with everybody.

4
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:37,939
I've started getting a little bit of cold symptoms, congestion in the nose, you probably hear it.

5
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:43,380
Uh, so I've taken a little bit of time off just over the last couple of days,

6
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,299
started getting a little bit of symptoms on Saturday. I have taken a COVID test.

7
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,979
So just kind of waiting to see what that says. I've been isolating. I haven't gone anywhere,

8
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:57,219
I haven't done anything. So I'm just gonna, I'm taking precautions here to make sure that,

9
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:04,739
you know, just in case. If I do, then I'll have to just kind of, I'll try to get through it,

10
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:14,739
you know, I'll get through it. But I don't think that's what it is. Because I've seen,

11
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:18,980
you know, how does COVID start, you know, that doesn't typically starts in the chest, but

12
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:24,180
who knows? I'm just trying to be completely cautious. I don't I want to be totally,

13
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:36,870
totally, totally safe with this, right? Can you smell? Yes, I can. I can smell, I can taste.

14
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:45,189
I just am stuffy and a little congested. And it's been like that for the last like,

15
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:49,189
probably four, three or four days. Hasn't really gone any further than that. Don't have a fever.

16
00:01:53,530 --> 00:02:05,780
We know you smell. You're a baby with a head cold. But I just want to be clear,

17
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,580
if people are like hearing something in my voice and they're like, wait a minute,

18
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,620
what the fuck is going on here, Jerma? I want you to know that I'm already kind of on top of it. So

19
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:30,150
already on top of it. He's got a new mic. If you do have it go into it with the mindset,

20
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,449
you'll get through it no matter what. Yeah. I've been taking vitamins too. I've been taking

21
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:42,490
vitamin D. I've been drinking like some vitamin supplemental drinks. My immune system is pretty

22
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:57,719
good. But I'm we'll see, right? I'll know soon. What is vitamin two? What did I say vitamin two?

23
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:11,430
I didn't I said vitamin D. I said vitamin two. No, I didn't. Yeah, I'm taking precautions,

24
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,469
you know, I'm taking vitamin two. I don't know. Did I do that? Well, that's weird if I did.

25
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:21,189
Anyways, let's play Yakuza Zero. It's funny that the title of this stream is I promise I will not

26
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:27,430
quit this game after three hours like I did last time. I played this before on stream a few years

27
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:33,560
ago. I stopped playing after three hours. And now I mean, I'm a little under the weather. We'll see

28
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,639
if I get to three hours. We'll see what happens after three hours. But I'll come back to it. No,

29
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:43,479
I'm no I'm playing this for more than three hours. I promise it's already in the title. It

30
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:59,460
has to be there. And by the way, there was a bet in pre stream chat too. Let me get this up. Hold

31
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:11,340
on. It was a pre stream bet that I won. It was it will I will I start the stream before 3pm? And

32
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:20,329
the answer is yes. If I didn't start before three, I was gonna have to add 100 billion dollars onto

33
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:29,480
the debt. So I gave myself a lot of incentive. How's the audio for you guys? Can you hear it?

34
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:44,230
Is it good? A little bit louder? Oh, did I make a tweet? No, I didn't. I didn't even make a tweet

35
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:58,120
about this. How about Yakuza guaranteed stream? No, I'm already playing it. How about just Yakuza?

36
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:05,540
Here we go. Yakuza. I don't care. Yakuza. And people won't know which one. So they'll be like,

37
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,389
I'm curious. Is he playing the new one? And they'll come in and inflate my view count.

38
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:24,970
twitch.tv slash germa985. That's my name, right? Yeah. All right, I'm gonna give this a real shot.

39
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:39,459
Let's go. New game. I don't recommend it for players who are skilled at action games.

40
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:49,860
This is the but I don't care. No, not flying on hard. Not flying on hard. He's never gonna finish

41
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,860
this omega lol. Hey, I didn't say I was ever gonna finish it. I said I was gonna play it for more

42
00:05:53,860 --> 00:06:00,889
than three hours. Play hard for 10 million off. No, that's not enough. Normal. I don't care.

43
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:10,899
You had an opportunity right there. That one guy was like, Oh, if that was like 150 million,

44
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:21,139
I would have done it. It was your opportunity. Okay, here's a fun experiment. Those of you that

45
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:24,500
watched the other stream that have access to it, I think it's only the archive channel, right?

46
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:36,250
Let's see how close this is to the other stream. Play them side by side. I'm gonna make the same

47
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:45,579
references. No, I'm gonna try to make completely different references. All right, what would I

48
00:06:45,579 --> 00:07:05,000
have said right here? Hi. Nice shoes, man. I'm trying to be different. You're trying hard now.

49
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,920
Fuck, I'm gonna be trying so hard to make like things I wouldn't have made a reference to

50
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:31,560
be different. It's when he said chat raid forced Mr. Stark to play Nancy Drew. Nice.

51
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:51,129
Oh, and he did it. That's great. Actually true. He did it. That's awesome. Oh, no, you guys. You

52
00:07:51,129 --> 00:08:17,459
guys now have a new Drew Crew streamer. December 9 1988 in Tokyo. This game about. Oh, the Yakuza,

53
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:27,079
right? No, Jeremy, it's about like growing up as a doctor.

54
00:08:28,040 --> 00:09:01,110
It's a dentist simulator. Did people recognize me? Oh, I've got what did I say here? I said

55
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:07,960
something here. I remember this. I think I said like, oh, sorry, I messily ate a hamburger or

56
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:15,740
something, right? Oh, that was a really good double cheeseburger with extra ketchup. Run it back. Is

57
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:32,139
that what I said? You said french fries. All right. No, stop telling me what I said. I don't. I'm

58
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:55,259
going to just be me. You said cheeseburger from Burger King. Fuck. Here's something that I didn't

59
00:09:55,259 --> 00:10:08,820
know. They drive on the other side of the road in Japan. I did not know that. Is the United States,

60
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,059
is the USA the only place that drives on the left side of the road? I mean, on the right side of

61
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:22,259
that. Wait, hold on. We're the only country on earth that I think is one of the country that

62
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:40,360
does that that drives on the right side. Arts of Africa do too. Less countries drive on the left.

63
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:52,940
Oh, at what point in this game do I go?

64
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:19,909
That was in 30 minutes.

65
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:34,840
I got a loan.

66
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,629
I got a loan. All right. I'm paying attention. Leave me alone.

67
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:53,580
I saw the word loan and my character was on the screen. So I was like, I have loan.

68
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,100
All right. Come work for me. Loan shark.

69
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,360
A lot easier than that Yakuza payroll.

70
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,740
By the way, I have to say,

71
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:33,019
what have you ever stopped and looked over your right shoulder while you were talking to someone?

72
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:37,690
What the fuck are you doing?

73
00:12:59,289 --> 00:13:04,500
See you around. I think that would be kind of weird.

74
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:10,500
You just have to tilt a few more degrees and you and I are talking normally.

75
00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:29,429
All right. Here we go. I mean, well, I meant like here comes the music.

76
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:50,730
Can you dance in this game? I swear to God, every TV movie and every show, every anime,

77
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,649
no one ever smokes a cigarette. It's lit in their mouth and that's it. And then you don't see it

78
00:13:54,649 --> 00:14:01,909
again. Okay. Where's the cigarette? Where is it? He had it. It takes like 10 minutes to smoke

79
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:13,139
a cigarette. Where is it? Let's see. Nope. Nope. No, no. He had a lit cigarette. The tip was lit.

80
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:30,379
Oh, there we go. Tip. That's a full cigarette back there in the background.

81
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:50,970
Smoking is hard to animate. Come on. Have a lit cigarette. Have one, a lit cigarette with just

82
00:14:50,970 --> 00:15:01,480
one puff out of it. Come on. Fuck. Doing the same jokes. Is that the same one? No, it's not. Show me.

83
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:24,700
That's not the same joke. Show me. Prove it. It can't be. No, it's not. This is where Nishiki said

84
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:31,830
to meet up me. I guess beat. I, Oh my God. Said he'd meet me. Guess I beat him here.

85
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:41,990
724106. Huh? That's code four. What you up to? I'm waiting for your slow ass to show up. Is this

86
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:52,580
when like twitch emotes become absolute language? May as well have a look around and see if I can

87
00:15:52,580 --> 00:16:05,509
find him. Okay. Let's meet him. Find Nishikiyama. Welcome. Oh, this is a save point. Can I save it?

88
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:21,100
There's a big S. Oh, you can save the game. Use the, and use the item box. And you save.

89
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:32,389
Million yen vending machine. How much yen do I have? It's a dream machine. Insert a million yen

90
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:39,450
to make your dreams come true. Maybe. I don't have enough money. I don't have that much. Oh,

91
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:52,279
well, whatever. Is there a sprint? I'm gonna take a second. I'm gonna just take a quick second.

92
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:57,370
Okay. All right, let's go. Like I'm already like running.

93
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:01,080
Wow. While running. Is there a run button?

94
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:21,500
Let's get in there. Somebody help me, please. Running shakedowns on our turf. Somebody needs

95
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:34,759
to set them straight before they try anything really stupid. What do you want? This ain't a show.

96
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:45,509
Oh, it's not. Wait, are you sure he's not Yakuza? So what if he is? He's our age. If he's Yakuza,

97
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:55,049
he's probably just an errand boy. Wait, let me do this accurately. It'd be a lot lower than this.

98
00:17:55,769 --> 00:18:06,619
And what if we are? My family runs this part of Kamurocho. If you were regulars, you'd know

99
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:15,579
better than to do anything stupid here. Excuse you? Where's a piece of Yakuza trash? Get off

100
00:18:15,579 --> 00:18:22,259
lecturing us. Yeah, that's more accurate. You can still kind of hear it a little bit.

101
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:36,329
All right, let's go. No music. What? I remember the fighting in this game was really fun.

102
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:44,920
It has a really good combat system is what I remember. Holy shit, that guy's annihilated.

103
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:53,380
Press Y during an X combo to perform a finishing blow. No music? What are you talking about?

104
00:18:53,380 --> 00:19:01,140
Turn up the music. I turned down the music because it's loud. Please, we can't hear it. Hold on.

105
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:09,670
Is it broken? Yeah, finishing blow knocks me down. The knockdown effect varies depending on

106
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:15,720
the number of times X is pressed. What are you guys on about? Wait, are you mad because it sounds

107
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:25,369
like it's coming through a wall? Oh shit, it is. It's like muffled coming through a wall.

108
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:40,150
What the fuck is going on? What? This is insane. Why do they have a setting where it's like you're

109
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:58,150
not at the party, but your neighbor is annoying? Okay. All right. I get it. I get it. Does that

110
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:07,740
just in the menu? All right, here you go. This is your music. This is a finishing blow. One, two,

111
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:19,259
three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. The yellow gauge on the top is to use your health.

112
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:22,299
The game will end if the yellow part is fully depleted, so keep an eye on your health at all

113
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:27,259
times. Yep. If the gauge flashes red, it means you're in a very bad shape and you should

114
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:32,539
replenish your health immediately. Use a health recovery snack or eat something. Yeah, okay.

115
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:38,819
Press B to grab someone. If an enemy is guarding to block your attacks, grab them and then attack

116
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:49,849
to deal damage. Hold on. This guy, why does that guy have rage mode? All right, come here.

117
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:02,599
One punch in the face. That's like WWF style. You're just letting me punch you in the face

118
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:10,950
as hard as I can. I'm turning that down. It's a little loud. Your training is now complete.

119
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:21,299
It's time to wipe the smirks off their faces. Let's go. Grab this guy. Punch him right down

120
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:32,119
his throat. Grab this guy. Punch him right down his throat. It's a bug. Wait, what? It's an actual

121
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:55,900
bug in the game? You need to put it in stereo. Wait, what is going on? Like that? Okay, I did it.

122
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:21,579
It's an in-game engine problem. Oh, well, it's all right. 2900. It sounds worse. What is wrong

123
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:25,259
with the audio? I'm trying to please put the volume in max.

124
00:22:41,349 --> 00:22:44,549
Restart the game? Well, let me save it first. Hold on.

125
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:54,099
I like that suit.

126
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:19,400
The Joker? It's not the Joker. Hey, this came out before the Joker did.

127
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,079
The new movie.

128
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:43,000
Joker's been around for 80 years. Yeah, but not the new movie that came out like a year ago.

129
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:15,500
I should put Kazama-san's mind at rest. I don't know about that. He always knew all I could do was

130
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:22,299
fight. The other one was good at the dance. Different categories. Was it with dancers, fighters?

131
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:32,650
I'm just reading. I can't read it. Why can't I read this?

132
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:40,250
Do I have to sit back in my chair and smoke my half-lit cigarette for four hours?

133
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:55,960
500 grand.

134
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:05,180
Kazama's father is always in plain clothes.

135
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,700
Passion? Cool.

136
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,660
Oh, you fight this guy. Spoilers for the other stream I did.

137
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:24,470
Do it.

138
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:53,369
Signed her jacket. It's a nice jacket. Cigarettes gone, by the way. Cigarettes gone.

139
00:25:56,009 --> 00:25:56,329
I win.

140
00:25:56,329 --> 00:26:07,130
He ate it.

141
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,299
I like the way it burns when it goes down my throat.

142
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:42,380
Hey, let's go. So what do you guys want me to do? I always hate matching speed in games like this.

143
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:46,460
Because you always just look like a weird guy that just can't keep up with his friend like,

144
00:26:46,460 --> 00:27:00,460
oh, shit, sorry. I have to tilt this thing. The way these two are interacting. This is just like

145
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:07,299
two drunk guys on the street. This is how they interact. Oh, sorry. Where do you want to go?

146
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:14,119
What's still open? That place is open. I don't want to go there, though. This place sucks.

147
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:21,049
Let's do one more. We can just walk to the hotel.

148
00:27:38,009 --> 00:27:41,769
Same joke. I can't wait to get three hours into this stream,

149
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:46,410
so I cannot be told I'm doing the same shit. We will cross that threshold,

150
00:27:46,410 --> 00:28:08,890
and I can't possibly do the same thing. We only have three hours of material. No.

151
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:26,359
All right, let's go. Let's do it. Let's have some fun. You got a Trojan condom ad?

152
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:31,589
Oh, aren't they targeted ads? Oh, I don't know what you're doing.

153
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:56,359
Max out the in-game volume? Okay, I will. All right, it's a fight. Oh, this is two drunk guys.

154
00:28:56,359 --> 00:29:10,390
Oh, I remember this. Yep. Okay, avoid exact same thing. Hey, old man, quit talking to those.

155
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:18,059
We're not done here. Who's an old man? You snot-nosed little punk. Who's a snot? Whatever you said.

156
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:34,549
Oh, shit, he just did the fucking Pac-Man technique. Now you've done it. Screw it.

157
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:37,430
They're completely wasted. It's not worth the trouble. Let's take a different road.

158
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:43,319
I got a faster way to fix this. Oh, yeah, I just need to sober them up a bit with my fists.

159
00:29:51,220 --> 00:30:03,400
Again, I can't tell if you're a sadist or a charity worker. No, well, you sweep the leg,

160
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,559
give them a blanket. Sweep the leg, give them a blanket, and put them in a safe place.

161
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:27,420
Brunkards. All right, heat gauge. Three blue glowing bars on the top left are called the heat

162
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:32,779
gauge. The heat gauge starts at first bar, and as your attacks hit enemies, the gauge fills up,

163
00:30:32,779 --> 00:30:37,339
shifting to the second and then third bar. At each level, your speed increases, some moves

164
00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:42,619
and require a certain level of heat. So once you are used to fighting, keep an eye on your heat

165
00:30:42,619 --> 00:30:47,640
level. Once the heat gauge shifts to the second or third bar, Kiryu's body begins to glow with a

166
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,519
little aura. This is called heat mode, and it signals that you can use a special heat action.

167
00:30:53,160 --> 00:31:02,099
Try using heat actions while sobering up the drunkards. What's this? It's CBD pen on stream

168
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:09,829
for 500 million off the debt. I don't smoke. I don't smoke. No, that's impossible. I don't

169
00:31:09,829 --> 00:31:18,039
have a CBD pen. Okay. All right, press B with the heat gauge at the second or third bar to grab

170
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:32,420
enemies and then press Y. It's a super punch. That hurts you too. That guy won. How much heat

171
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:44,299
does this guy have? Okay, your training is now complete. That concludes the explanation of the

172
00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:49,259
heat gauge and special moves, but the two drunkards still need some sobriety beaten into them.

173
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:54,460
If you take if you take a fighting stance using RB movement with the left stick will center around

174
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,140
the enemy in front of you. This is very effective when you want to focus your attacks on a single

175
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:32,839
enemy like this guy. Use RB and RB to lock RB to lock onto an enemy. Why do that when you just do

176
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:53,619
that? Right bumper. What I think I changed. I changed it. Didn't I? Losing to the drunk guys.

177
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:59,450
No, I have too much health to lose to the drunk guys. It's impossible. Deal update. No,

178
00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:13,589
I'm not taking any drugs right now. Okay. I'm sorry. It's not drug related. It better not be.

179
00:33:13,589 --> 00:33:21,910
If it is, I'm if this is drug related, I'm taking 100 million off the debt. Okay. New deal. All

180
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:26,440
money collected in Yakuza by the end of the stream will go towards paying off the debt.

181
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:44,390
Notice yen to USD conversion will apply all money collected. All right. That sounds pretty good.

182
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:48,710
So all money that so all money collected are all money that I have in my bank account by the end

183
00:33:48,710 --> 00:34:01,769
of the stream. Wait with conversion, wouldn't that? Okay. Collected. End of the game. Whatever.

184
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:10,789
Okay, Mr. Hero, I'll walk you to the train. Take it slow. Oh, thanks. You're awful considerate

185
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:25,940
for a kid your age. All's well that ends well. One USD is 100 yen. Okay. Completing certain

186
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:31,460
challenges for your CP completion points. You can view them for the pause menu under completion

187
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:35,380
list. Some of the some of the things. Some are things that will probably happen on their own

188
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:41,079
as you play the game. But yeah, all right. Exchanging CP visit temples or shrines to

189
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:47,989
access the CP exchange menu where you can spend CP to earn special blessings ranging from being

190
00:34:47,989 --> 00:35:00,980
able to sprint for longer distances or to earning more cash from fights. Okay, cool. What a waste.

191
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:12,730
A damn shame I say. So just out of curiosity. It's been like this game kind of slow start.

192
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:18,260
It's been 40 minutes and I've kind of barely just started doing stuff. How did I play this game for

193
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:27,019
like three hours and stop? I don't understand. What did I say? What? Why did I say? Oh, I'm done.

194
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:41,909
It's because I was just super like ADHD and I couldn't even handle it. Oh, okay. Yeah. You

195
00:35:41,909 --> 00:35:46,869
want to talk alcohol. You're like taking one swig from a vintage bottle and tossing the rest.

196
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:58,380
Going from the look of you. You're Japanese mafia. Yeah. Hey, something like that. Yes. Seems like

197
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:05,099
you're pretty confident in a fight. A real dynamite boy. Calling me boy. Ha ha. Don't get ruffled

198
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:11,179
now kid. Compared to me, you're practically a toddler. Hey, hear you. What's the hold up, man?

199
00:36:11,179 --> 00:36:17,909
It's nothing. Be right there. No sense wasting time with this drunk. Let's just go. Too much

200
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:24,869
booze is bad for you gramps. Take care. Hey, now hold up. Wait, I got one piece of advice for you

201
00:36:24,869 --> 00:36:30,170
and I've got a friend waiting for me. If you got something to say, make it quick. Oh,

202
00:36:30,969 --> 00:36:35,590
out for a night with your main dog? Me and the boys used to really wreck it back when I was your

203
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:40,949
age. But if you spend all your money playing around, you'll never get stronger. You got to

204
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:47,369
invest in yourself. What? Like a gym membership? No, no, no, no, no, no. That's no better than

205
00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:53,880
spending it on booze. I'm talking about investing in yourself literally. Literally? What's that even

206
00:36:53,880 --> 00:37:04,469
mean? Glad you asked, my boy. Here's a special lecture just for you. Upgrades are now available.

207
00:37:04,469 --> 00:37:18,010
Cool. It's like Path of Exile. I have 232,000 yen. So what do I do first? Throw your entire body

208
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:28,739
behind a vicious kick. Cool. Max health. Heat gauge will slowly rise over time when you are wounded.

209
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:51,510
However, it will only fill up to the second bar. Okay. Two million? What is it? Yen what?

210
00:37:51,510 --> 00:38:03,960
Sick. Okay, so the heat gauge just slowly rises when I'm taking when I'm hurt. Pretty sick. Hey,

211
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:09,449
spend money to make money. That's right. You got to spend money to make money. 200,000?

212
00:38:09,449 --> 00:38:17,900
Oh, I'm considered a brawler. You keep pouring money into yourself with a little training. That

213
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:23,739
talent of yours will grow in no time. So keep the women in wine on a budget, you hear? Ah,

214
00:38:23,739 --> 00:38:29,690
investing in myself, literally. Never thought of that. Yeah, I bet you're glad you stopped and

215
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:38,250
listened down, aren't you? Yeah, I guess I am. Yo, Kiryu. I'm coming. Oh, that serious talk killed my

216
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:46,780
buds. Time for round two. You have a good night, my boy. Is Blackjack in this game?

217
00:38:49,909 --> 00:38:55,340
Whatever. I don't care anymore. What a weird old man. What's his deal?

218
00:38:56,059 --> 00:39:15,449
A nice Irish Japanese guy. Well, it said foreigner, didn't it? Oh, yeah, it did say foreigner. Yeah.

219
00:39:15,449 --> 00:39:28,460
Bacchus isn't Japanese. No, he's the god of wine.

220
00:39:46,579 --> 00:39:53,300
Bacchus is, Bacchus is Greek, yeah. I know my Greek gods. I know when I hover over him in spite

221
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:59,059
and I select him, he goes, Bacchus. I know his name. He's a big fat guy and he's a big turkey leg.

222
00:40:06,889 --> 00:40:07,530
It's Roman.

223
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:15,000
Hi, guys.

224
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:28,150
College girl slash hostess. Madoka-chan and Yui-chan. Hey, one dimensional gamer,

225
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:32,809
thanks for the den. Thanks a lot.

226
00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:51,050
Well, I want to.

227
00:40:54,679 --> 00:41:03,800
Don't be like that. Here, pick a card, any card. How's money? I thought I was doing like a cool

228
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:24,630
magic trick. Why don't you get so popular with the ladies? Wait, don't tell me you think I

229
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:31,530
just let those two play me for 40 grand. Oh, wait, that's, hold on. Who's this?

230
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:44,070
Okay, if you gave 40 grand to just two random girls that were like, hey, maybe this is the club.

231
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:51,579
I think you kind of did. You think I just gave two people $40,000 to have fun? Whatever.

232
00:41:53,340 --> 00:42:09,610
I know it's 400, but if it wasn't, this dude's rich as fuck.

233
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:24,969
I remember when they used to have the two slots in the front for the audio video cables

234
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:29,510
and it would trail all the way to where your console was and someone would just trip over

235
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:33,110
and rip the fucking cables out and just ruin your Super Mario session.

236
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:41,989
It would be like, dad, you would trip and he'd be like, he'd get caught up and go, god damn it.

237
00:42:50,010 --> 00:43:14,150
This is completely unrelated somehow, but it's made me think. One of my friends rented

238
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:22,389
Rugrats from Blockbuster one time and he hated it so much. It was such a shitty game

239
00:43:22,389 --> 00:43:28,789
that he threw it down his stairs and destroyed it and they had to like pay for it from Blockbuster.

240
00:43:38,059 --> 00:43:39,820
How old was he? I don't know, like 12.

241
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:56,619
The search for Reptar sucks.

242
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:11,380
I remember he had a really long staircase, like a very long straight down stairwell.

243
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,940
So this thing just sunk into the well. It was just like

244
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:33,699
a CD, right? Yeah, it was like PlayStation 1.

245
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:55,880
Maybe it was N64. It was one of the two. Rugrats was PS1. Yeah,

246
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,320
I like scratched up. It didn't work anymore.

247
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:11,019
Karaoke is a rhythm game where you press buttons shown on the screen with the song.

248
00:45:11,019 --> 00:45:16,039
Yeah, make sure to press the correct buttons the right time.

249
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,559
When someone else sings, you can support them with interjections. Remember this.

250
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:31,210
You can choose simple or lively interjections. Sing along, tambourine, maracas. I remember this.

251
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:41,340
Yep, I do. Yeah, let's go. Oh wait, somebody's done. I have to fix the audio, don't I?

252
00:45:42,440 --> 00:46:00,119
Judgment. I'm going to sing Judgment. Let me turn it up. Is this a meme song?

253
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:12,099
Oh my god, what is this? Fuck, it's not. I'm sorry.

254
00:46:17,289 --> 00:46:20,650
I don't know the controls. I don't know the buttons. I swear to god.

255
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:25,530
I have to look down at it sometimes. I don't. Xbox and shit. I'm serious.

256
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:50,820
I memorize PlayStation, not Xbox. Is anybody else? Anybody else?

257
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:22,420
Oh, I could kill that. Hold on. I got so into that part. I couldn't sing the rest of it.

258
00:47:34,699 --> 00:47:42,440
Nice, nice, nice, nice. Yeah, X on Xbox versus X on PlayStation. It just messes up my brain.

259
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:48,570
So I have in my mind have burned the PlayStation controller into my brain.

260
00:47:49,289 --> 00:48:04,039
So if I see X pop up on Xbox, it's like, oh no, wrong. I got 87. That's fine.

261
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:19,000
Entertain yourself 10 times. Just burn your Xbox brain. You want me to burn my brain?

262
00:48:32,139 --> 00:48:44,619
Let me try to do that fix that people are saying.

263
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:53,670
I can plant it in that drink.

264
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:25,860
English. If I change from Japanese to English at this point, I'm going to be attacked.

265
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,369
All right, let me see if I can get this right. So you guys were saying

266
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:45,719
turn the background volume all the way up. Okay. And then

267
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:59,530
it's kind of loud from the master all the way up and both all the way up.

268
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:06,389
What the fuck? Why is it like a waterfall?

269
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:14,570
Now this is wicked loud.

270
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:19,699
Oh, okay. So

271
00:50:19,699 --> 00:50:28,260
I turn it down in the mixer.

272
00:50:33,849 --> 00:50:39,940
Okay, I'm turning it down in the mixer and that should be good.

273
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:48,150
Get off me.

274
00:50:58,019 --> 00:50:59,619
Why does it sound like we're at a water park?

275
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:05,579
This is just the sounds you hear when you're standing in the line.

276
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,059
Get off me.

277
00:51:16,219 --> 00:51:19,820
Quit doing that like Naruto move where it like splits into two people.

278
00:51:20,699 --> 00:51:44,360
Why can't you have normal audio? I didn't do anything. What did I do wrong?

279
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,039
I didn't do anything wrong. I'm sorry.

280
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:50,440
I turned the volume down and everybody got mad at me.

281
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:05,050
A lot of the young males are severely beaten in a quiet corner of Kamurocho.

282
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:15,610
You know what's happening so far? Yes.

283
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,420
Yep, we got we got cigarettes.

284
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:48,230
Two just a couple of cigarettes freshly lit.

285
00:52:54,780 --> 00:53:00,539
I thought he was holding a cigarette too for a second. I don't know why.

286
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:36,199
Oh shit. That's the guy. That's the guy that from the beginning. Yep.

287
00:53:36,679 --> 00:54:03,860
Why'd you do that? There's too many lit cigarettes in here. The fire alarm's going off.

288
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:09,460
Fellas, can you put them down? And like 30 people in the restaurant look over with the

289
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:12,420
lit cigarettes like, oh, yes. Oh, oh, sorry.

290
00:54:37,000 --> 00:55:11,880
I'm doing the thing where

291
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:16,199
somebody that you're watching a movie with has their eyes down on their phone almost the whole

292
00:55:16,199 --> 00:55:26,119
time. And they just say, oh, fuck. What? Because they're humoring you because you're the one that

293
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:35,780
picked the movie. And they murdered him. Murder. What the fuck, dude? I'm just texting my mom.

294
00:55:44,579 --> 00:56:09,349
How did I not make it three hours? I must have just so badly wanted to leave the game last time.

295
00:56:09,349 --> 00:56:35,539
Why? Because Ubisoft games are bad. Isn't this a Sega game? This isn't Ubisoft.

296
00:56:36,019 --> 00:56:52,409
I've got to call the Jima family HQ. This should be a payphone. Find a payphone. Save. Save it.

297
00:56:52,969 --> 00:57:09,829
Is this, is this in the trash? Where's the save? What? Oh, bro. I look, I'm just looking at the

298
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:20,570
minimap. A Twitch actor and the nominees for best Twitch actor of the year. German985.

299
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:23,849
Where's the payphone? Oh my God. Where's the trash?

300
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:37,289
I'm just sitting in the audience just like, yeah, I'm in the full like three piece suit.

301
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:56,090
Like clasping hands with the person next to me. The eyes closed and the winner for best

302
00:57:56,090 --> 00:58:08,780
pretender on Twitch. And somebody else and my eyes open. It was supposed to be me.

303
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:20,070
What was your acceptance speech V? Yeah. Okay. My acceptance speech to win that award. I would

304
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:27,429
go up there and I'd be like, I would start walking down the aisle and I would trip. Oh,

305
00:58:27,429 --> 00:58:31,349
but it was a joke. I was pretending. Oh, and I would just swipe my head when I got up like,

306
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:52,780
everyone would laugh their asses off. You do the Willy Wonka. Yeah. I would look around. I'd be

307
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:58,860
like, where's the podium? I put my hand up like I'm looking out over yonder on something like a

308
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:03,980
sailing boat. I don't see the podium. And everyone's pointing like it's up there. Oh,

309
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:09,500
he's lying to pretender. He's doing it. And I'm like, I can't say it. Where is it? Oh, there it

310
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:27,110
is. I spin around like five times. Pantomime the speech. I'd get up there and pretend the mic

311
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:32,539
didn't work. I'd be like just moving my mouth with no words. I wouldn't be saying anything.

312
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:56,949
Get out of the way. $470. That's just a real life children's. No, that's a clown. That's a mime.

313
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:20,469
I'd be a mime without the makeup on. That'd be so stupid. You're always a clown without the makeup

314
01:00:20,469 --> 01:00:28,329
on silly. God, if I sometimes I wish I just could turn the webcam on right now and just start

315
01:00:28,329 --> 01:00:53,159
going nuts making a balloon animal. Oh, I'll get that ready one day. Oh, that's the guy. I fight

316
01:00:53,159 --> 01:01:09,820
that guy. Spoilers. You probably fight everybody in this room over the course of a 12 hour campaign.

317
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:29,880
Oh, it's a 70 hour game. Oh,

318
01:01:56,219 --> 01:01:59,340
I feel like when you catch yourself sitting like that, you go. Oh, fuck. You set up straight.

319
01:02:01,179 --> 01:02:03,500
Thank you. Oh, my God. What am I? I'm sitting so

320
01:02:17,909 --> 01:02:19,909
good.

321
01:02:27,659 --> 01:02:31,019
I feel like I posed these guys in G mod to take a thumbnail picture.

322
01:03:02,199 --> 01:03:05,210
Oh,

323
01:03:11,909 --> 01:03:33,860
how do we do that? We simply kill the Batman. Come on. No, I just said it. I just said it for fun.

324
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:36,179
I wasn't trying to be like funny. I just like had to say it.

325
01:03:36,420 --> 01:04:08,090
Oh, that hurt my head. It probably hurt his leg. That sounded like it really fucking hurt.

326
01:04:11,929 --> 01:04:13,530
That was right in the middle of the shin bone.

327
01:04:14,679 --> 01:04:15,960
So

328
01:04:26,119 --> 01:04:27,079
same joke. No.

329
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:37,530
Just wait till I get over three hours and I could just get a new goddamn material.

330
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:57,320
How am I supposed to? It was like three and a half years ago,

331
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,480
even longer. It was like four years ago.

332
01:05:23,369 --> 01:05:27,849
You should have replayed the original stream. Oh, that would have been actually very good idea.

333
01:05:37,429 --> 01:05:39,000
Let's see if you guys figure it out.

334
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:51,880
I'm going to play the VOD from this point. Let's see what happens.

335
01:05:56,340 --> 01:06:05,480
Everybody hold on a sec. You ready for this shit? We're going to have a little bit of fun.

336
01:06:06,119 --> 01:06:13,460
I'm going to play it from this exact moment. One sec.

337
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:18,329
This guy's name is Bacchus.

338
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:26,739
All right. How far did I get? Did I do things in a different order?

339
01:06:30,650 --> 01:06:37,579
Okay. So did that happen yet? Did this part happen yet?

340
01:06:37,579 --> 01:07:06,619
I gotta get the right spot. Okay. So right when the cut scene ends,

341
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,400
I don't want to see any of the jokes. I don't want to see if I want to see if I do it the same way.

342
01:07:29,239 --> 01:07:37,380
Come on, give me it. All right. Here it is. It loads up right here at one hour and okay.

343
01:07:38,329 --> 01:07:42,650
Now loading. I have a better computer. I have a better computer.

344
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:56,489
Okay. I got the spot. It's one hour, one minute and 27 seconds.

345
01:08:12,019 --> 01:08:17,460
Oh, no, no. Fuck this game. This game sucks. I don't own it. I don't play it. I'll never play

346
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:22,899
it again. It's a dick. I hate this game. Bastion's not the most beautiful zone. Now,

347
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:31,689
Drac, this is not a cool. Obviously, I'm going to. All right. 101 27. I thought something was

348
01:08:31,689 --> 01:08:40,539
really funny right there. All right. 101 27. Thanks for the 256. I'm going to be thanking subs.

349
01:08:44,149 --> 01:08:49,500
101 27. Whatever the next cut scene is, I think I'm going to have to skip it.

350
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,739
All right. We're in an in-game cut scene. That might be that. Okay. Here we go.

351
01:08:53,579 --> 01:09:00,229
And it's going to be like here. All right. Let's get this out of the way.

352
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:26,260
I got to get this in the right spot. Okay. So remember, it's like right when the camera pans

353
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:53,140
and we go wrong cut scene. No, it's not. Oh, sick cigarette. He took at least a third of that off

354
01:09:53,140 --> 01:10:09,060
with that hall. By the way, I should probably mute this audio from me so I don't hear what I'm saying.

355
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:14,119
Yeah.

356
01:10:21,699 --> 01:10:23,460
Keep it. All right. Fine.

357
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:38,220
Oh, Germany is German Spaniard. No, he's not. I'll make sure he's not.

358
01:11:06,619 --> 01:11:13,979
Oh, you're bored already. No, I'm not. I'm just I'm not going to do this the whole time.

359
01:11:13,979 --> 01:11:37,220
I'm just going to do this for a few minutes. He wouldn't do this if he wasn't bored. I'm not

360
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:42,579
bored. I'm going to give it the chance it deserves, but I'm just give me a minute.

361
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:53,369
I'm not bored. I'm not bored. Are you sure you don't like the TV show, dude? You're looking at

362
01:11:53,369 --> 01:11:58,649
your phone a lot. Well, we say I'm watching some I'm watching the time that I watched the movie

363
01:11:59,619 --> 01:12:05,180
four years ago on my phone. That's kind of fucking weird. Why don't you just watch

364
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:10,340
the movie with me? I was wondering what my reactions were four years ago.

365
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:32,229
Yeah, what a psycho. What like an egomaniac. Like dude, the movie's on the screen right now.

366
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:37,960
Man, you don't have to watch you reacting to the movie we're currently watching now.

367
01:12:37,960 --> 01:13:00,579
Just watch the movie with me. I got to be way funnier than past Jeremy. This is important.

368
01:13:00,579 --> 01:13:19,100
He thinks he's going to fucking win. Nope. Do the Mario Kart ghost. Yeah, I'm going to

369
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:22,060
I'll change that. I'll make the transparency smaller. I'll make it. I'll do it. I just got to

370
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:28,569
get in the right spot. OK, here we go. This is important against my ghost. Here we go. Ready?

371
01:13:28,569 --> 01:13:38,680
I got to get a time that's right. Loading screen. Here comes the pan. And there it is. OK,

372
01:13:39,399 --> 01:13:56,789
we have synced up the timelines. I am going against my Mario Kart ghost. Can I be funnier

373
01:13:56,789 --> 01:14:06,859
than my Mario Kart ghost? Let's see. I got to change the opacity on it, though. Filter is

374
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:22,100
uh, opacity. Where's opacity? How come I can't drop the opacity? Color correction? No.

375
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:35,819
Maybe it is color. No. Promo? OK, here we go. This should be do it. There we go. OK,

376
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:42,060
there's my my my Mario Kart ghost is here. Should it be over the whole thing?

377
01:14:43,739 --> 01:14:51,590
No, I can't. I can't. That's going to make people puke. People are going to get sick.

378
01:14:54,649 --> 01:15:06,340
I'm going to drop the opacity a little more. That's too much. Mario Kart ghost. OK, it's at 50%.

379
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:19,510
All right, I'm ready. I'm ready. Here we go. You ready? I'm going to kick my ass. Three, two,

380
01:15:20,229 --> 01:15:24,390
one, go. I'm going to get a text message from fucking what's the guy's name? Looks like your

381
01:15:24,390 --> 01:15:27,989
loan shark has met me up. Alec, the guy that wants to go bowling. What's his name? The cousin.

382
01:15:28,869 --> 01:15:32,310
Fuck, you heard GTA reference. Derek, what's his name? What's the guy's name that wants to

383
01:15:32,310 --> 01:15:35,829
always go bowling? Nico. No, not that. Shut up, you. Stop showing me that guy.

384
01:15:37,479 --> 01:15:44,199
Nick, not Nico. What's the other guy's name? Roman. Why am I still frozen on the other screen?

385
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:53,819
Not this guy again. Wait, why is this frozen? I think Derek. Wait, pause it. Pause it. Yeah,

386
01:15:53,819 --> 01:16:00,180
the old guy from last night. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I found this guy, too. No, it's frozen.

387
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:05,060
No, no, I froze it. I teach you how to put points. No, he's so much funnier than me already. Where

388
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:19,460
did it go? And this guy is. Why did that happen? Fuck. Hold on. Oh, fuck. Come on. The stupid OBS

389
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:27,979
sucks. Hold on. I'm going to get a text message from fucking what's the guy's name? Alec. Alec,

390
01:16:27,979 --> 01:16:32,380
the guy that wants to go bowling. What's his name? The cousin. I teach you how to put. OK,

391
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:37,100
here it is. Oh, you're. Let's get it lined up. Derek, what's his name? What's the guy's name

392
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:43,850
that wants to always go bowling? Fuck Streamlabs OBS. It sucks. Stop showing me that guy. All right,

393
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:48,699
hold on. Here we go. Nick, not Nico. What's the other guy's name? Roman. There it is.

394
01:16:52,229 --> 01:17:03,510
Here we go. Ready? Not this guy again. Oh, you're the guy from last night. OK, three, two, one,

395
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:10,600
go. Derek. Oh, the old guy from last night. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've been searching for hours.

396
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:16,039
And I found this guy, too. For me. You Rika booze. You're wasted. I teach you how to put points.

397
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,340
I just. And this guy is going to teach you how to do things.

398
01:17:22,699 --> 01:17:26,810
No, fuck. He's past German's going too fast.

399
01:17:27,689 --> 01:17:30,869
That's somebody's having a good morning. They're really they're really angry,

400
01:17:30,869 --> 01:17:35,609
really angry people in time to fight. I got it. I got to go faster than a kid.

401
01:17:36,329 --> 01:17:39,449
Is this the same two guys, three guys that were in the alleyway before?

402
01:17:41,829 --> 01:17:46,180
Yeah, you mentioned you've been looking for me. Actually, wait, hey, what'd you get? Hey,

403
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:52,760
what'd you get those elbow pads for football from the 1930s? Yeah, I did.

404
01:17:54,229 --> 01:17:58,869
So we they're asking for money. Obviously, I'm going to kick the shit out of these guys.

405
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:02,390
I'm going to beat them up and he's going to teach me something.

406
01:18:03,510 --> 01:18:07,109
I don't know which one's even real. This hurts my head. I can't look at this.

407
01:18:07,109 --> 01:18:10,069
You think he'd beat you? No, I don't know. That's a great question to ask them. They're

408
01:18:10,069 --> 01:18:13,430
really eager to talk to you. Don't take don't don't bait the streamer into doing something

409
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:17,590
stupid that he doesn't want to do. Oh, hey, speak of the devil. Here they are now.

410
01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:26,039
Okay. All right, Gramps. Is this the kid? Yes, sir. My prize pupil. Sorry, pupil. This guy's

411
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:30,119
just like doesn't feel well. The million you lent the million yen loan that I get those two dead

412
01:18:30,119 --> 01:18:35,640
beasts is way past due. I need it back. I ain't waiting much longer. You'll tell me about it.

413
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:42,460
Wait, I tell you about it. Wait, expect me to tell you. I can't even talk. I can't even talk.

414
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:50,899
I have to lower it. It's making me want to throw up. All right. There. That's better. Come on.

415
01:18:50,899 --> 01:18:56,710
All right. Come on. Come on. Come on. All right. Wait, he's ahead of me. He's ahead of me.

416
01:18:56,710 --> 01:19:00,390
This guy's definitely like a master boxer. No, no, no, no. Go, go, go. He's way ahead of me.

417
01:19:02,859 --> 01:19:07,350
Okay. All right. Pay the money. Wise choice. You want to pay me double? I got to beat him.

418
01:19:07,989 --> 01:19:12,470
No. All right. Let's go. Fight me, you bastards. Teach this whippersnapper how to fight.

419
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:20,710
You'll be fine. Just a little workout and fight. All right. I got to kick the shit out of this guy

420
01:19:20,710 --> 01:19:25,100
right now. Is that me just daydreaming about how I wish I could do that?

421
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:41,270
I can't skip the cutscene. That was so much funnier. Okay. It's my turn. That's a great

422
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:45,989
smash intro. That's a great like I just won Smash Brothers against like four friends.

423
01:19:50,489 --> 01:19:54,170
I did say this was going to be a movie in the very beginning. I tried to win you guys.

424
01:19:55,130 --> 01:20:04,550
Okay. Here we go. I heard the word murder parade. He's fine. Told you. Didn't a big guy. I didn't

425
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:11,130
punch him. Go, go, go. That's the same joke but worse. No, it's not. It's better.

426
01:20:15,029 --> 01:20:17,670
Okay. I meant when I said it wouldn't. You already saw the video. He said it.

427
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:21,829
All right. Then round two. I know how to play already. I'm going to kick it. Okay. I'm almost

428
01:20:21,829 --> 01:20:27,800
ahead. I'm almost ahead. I'm almost ahead. It's free thug. Let's go. You can switch to rush style

429
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:33,270
by pressing. I don't care. I was going to get ahead of him. Old German was terrible at video

430
01:20:33,270 --> 01:20:42,699
games. Actually, he's way better. You can evade. Yep. Evade nine times. How many times has he

431
01:20:42,699 --> 01:21:05,500
evaded? He's so ahead of me. Come on. All right. Use rush style moves to crush Bruno and show him

432
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:09,180
who's boss. When using the rush style, you can stun enemies by hitting them a certain number of

433
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:13,500
times. Attacks on stunned enemies will knock them down without fail. All right. Let's go.

434
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:45,020
Old German pog. No, don't say that. Old German sucks. New German. New Vegas art. I think I beat

435
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:52,630
him. Wait, how much health? I'm beating him. I'm winning. He hit me with every move.

436
01:21:57,460 --> 01:22:07,159
Come on. I got to dodge. I'm not dodging. Come on, please. All right. Give me a little bit of slack.

437
01:22:07,159 --> 01:22:10,119
I'm hearing myself fucking talk and I'm hearing the audio twice.

438
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:24,220
It's circle, right? That's cool. Cool. All right. We're good. Are we done with the tutorial?

439
01:22:24,949 --> 01:22:30,710
What? How much longer is the tutorial? No. Yeah, we already were. What family are you guys from?

440
01:22:31,350 --> 01:22:36,489
Wait, you're a Yakuza? I'm so sorry, sir. I didn't know we work for Toko credit.

441
01:22:37,529 --> 01:22:41,770
Name's Kiryu. Dojima family. What family are you guys with? Boss, the president. Wait,

442
01:22:41,770 --> 01:22:45,850
you're a proper Yakuza? Sorry, sir. I didn't know we just work for Toko credit.

443
01:22:47,210 --> 01:22:50,890
Well, there's no coincidence. I have business with your boss. I need to meet him. Fuck,

444
01:22:51,609 --> 01:22:55,770
I got to pull that out. President, I figured he'd be at the office this hour.

445
01:22:56,810 --> 01:23:00,970
I see. That's in a building on Tehei Boulevard East, right? I'll pay him a visit then.

446
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:09,060
This is the real fun stuff. Well, I can't wait to have a ton of fucking fun on Thursday.

447
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:26,739
I can't. I can't. It's hurting me. This guy's name is Bacchus. I'm sorry, guys. I just skipped a

448
01:23:26,739 --> 01:23:38,649
little bit. This guy can teach me a lot about fighting. OK, in the parking lot. OK, so this

449
01:23:38,649 --> 01:23:45,210
guy's in the parking lot. This guy hangs out and drinks and like levels you up. And there's a guy

450
01:23:45,210 --> 01:23:57,899
at a bank like I know this is going to be fun. I can't wait. This guy wants me to box for a living

451
01:23:57,899 --> 01:24:03,880
and like he wants to make money. Well, it's karaoke. You guys hear me? Anybody hear me?

452
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:13,689
I'm like fading out of it. I feel weird. What's fucking happening? OK, so I got to go to the bank.

453
01:24:13,689 --> 01:24:20,949
Oh, no, no, I'm I'm denial. Oh, fuck. What an idiotic thing to do. I went back in time

454
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:26,470
and I fuck with the timelines. I'm trying to replace myself. No, this is weird. I feel like

455
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:32,789
I'm drunk. The fuck? Why can't I go in here? No, I'm I feel I taste I taste like metal

456
01:24:34,229 --> 01:24:45,399
out of my way. Anybody hear me? Uh, OK, let's just do this. Get this out of the way. No, I have to

457
01:24:45,399 --> 01:24:50,920
stop and catch my I can run more than this guy. How sad is that? This guy's like a mastermind

458
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:56,279
Yakuza assassin. He can sprint down an alley and then he has to catch his breath. I can run

459
01:24:56,920 --> 01:25:03,979
like a mile like that. I could run a full sprint mile. This guy can't even do it around a fucking

460
01:25:03,979 --> 01:25:11,020
corner. Get ready for this. No, go in the building. Like, what do you mean get go get ready?

461
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:21,500
I want to get through this as fast as possible. I'm ready. Oh, maybe I wasn't ready.

462
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:27,420
I'm ready. These guys all have like weapons. What are you doing here, punk?

463
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:33,579
It's like the same guy.

464
01:25:46,649 --> 01:25:48,649
OK, no interest in speaking with me. That's fine.

465
01:25:49,449 --> 01:25:54,329
This is the first test. This is the first test of real raw game.

466
01:25:56,970 --> 01:26:03,960
Time to go. Oh, go credit men. They have pipes. Let's go into our dodge.

467
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:31,579
Um, that was kind of fun. But where am I? I better get moving. Come on, Bruno. Pick it up.

468
01:26:33,079 --> 01:26:42,170
Wait, I just saw the birth of Jesus. And then it's it's it's leaving. It's leaving.

469
01:26:42,170 --> 01:26:45,130
That's all the dinosaurs die. It's leaving. It's leaving. It's leaving. It's leaving.

470
01:26:45,130 --> 01:26:48,329
No, no, no, no. They were swimming. What? No, no, no, no, no. It's gone. It's gone. What's happening?

471
01:26:49,130 --> 01:27:01,859
I um, hey, tell me something. Oh, just who are you? Why approach me? What are you after me? Yes.

472
01:27:01,859 --> 01:27:06,340
Well, people here call me Bacchus and I come here because you had me angry at one time.

473
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:12,140
Yeah, nice of you to dump him on me. Look, if you're in some trouble, tell me. Maybe I can help.

474
01:27:12,939 --> 01:27:16,869
And that goes for him too. Those weren't the moves of an amateur. What's his deal?

475
01:27:17,850 --> 01:27:23,189
A real steal of a deal is what it is. He's got a gig sweatier than honey.

476
01:27:24,869 --> 01:27:27,750
He's fascinating to watch. You should go have a look too.

477
01:27:28,630 --> 01:27:32,090
At Comedio's job, but he's homeless, right? What kind of work does he do?

478
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:36,420
He's a whatchamacallit. A fristing artist.

479
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:42,140
Whoa, that's not really my scene. Let's punch out.

480
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:49,100
Yeah, that. A punch out artist. A slip of the tongue. All right, so what's a punch out artist?

481
01:27:50,569 --> 01:27:53,529
The customer pays a fee and then they get to throw as many punches at me as they like.

482
01:27:54,329 --> 01:27:56,569
I don't think I follow. This is a new S&M thing.

483
01:27:58,060 --> 01:28:02,539
No, nothing like that. Come on and watch. If you've got questions, I work in the Shichufuku

484
01:28:02,539 --> 01:28:07,659
parking lot. Jimo-kun, he's got plenty to teach about fighting, my boy.

485
01:28:07,659 --> 01:28:09,180
You'll kick yourself if you don't check it out.

486
01:28:10,409 --> 01:28:13,130
All right, I'll get the picture. Parking lot, right? I swing by if I can.

487
01:28:13,930 --> 01:28:17,989
It's Kira-san from the Dojima family, right? I'll be waiting. See you soon.

488
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:21,220
Okay. Sorry, what am I gonna go here?

489
01:28:21,939 --> 01:28:27,979
Well, that takes care of my troubles for today, I suppose. Still can't convince you to take on the

490
01:28:27,979 --> 01:28:33,500
world. The world? What does it even mean? Are you still trying to recruit me into the pro fighting

491
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:37,909
scene? It's exactly what it was. You got potential most men can't even dream about.

492
01:28:37,909 --> 01:28:42,659
That would champ the title be yours. Sorry, I'm not the same starry-eyed kid who would fall for

493
01:28:42,659 --> 01:28:47,960
that kind of line. You look at a scout, somebody keep looking. I'll tell you one thing, boy. You

494
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:52,840
keep living street fight to street fight. You'll wind up with a knife between your ribs. It's a

495
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:57,479
dark alley. That's no way to go out. You belong in the light, the spotlight, and I can't get you

496
01:28:57,479 --> 01:29:03,420
under the brightest ones. What do you say? Okay. We just met. You're not wanting to change your

497
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:08,409
life around because some old geezer told you to. So I'll give up. That doesn't mean giving up for

498
01:29:08,409 --> 01:29:14,840
good. You got room to grow like a tree. I'll keep coaching you along the way. You've got skills as

499
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:20,760
a trainer. That much I believe. But I'm not really in a position to be worrying about that. Sorry,

500
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:25,159
but hey, maybe I'll see you around. Okay, my boy. Just steer clear of the dark alley still then,

501
01:29:25,159 --> 01:29:31,590
you hear? No knives in those ribs or bullets for that matter. Are you trying to jinx me? You see

502
01:29:31,590 --> 01:29:41,500
you later, Pockus. Okay. Apparently the Toko credit president's in his office on Tai Boulevard East.

503
01:29:41,500 --> 01:30:03,210
I'll start there. All right, let's go. I'm gonna head down this way. I'm stuck. Oh, oh, oh, what's

504
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:14,279
oh. Oh, man. These guys. Oh, shit. These guys got weapons. What? Never mind. These guys have

505
01:30:14,279 --> 01:30:38,539
weapons. No, they don't. What? I don't have any weapons. Why did I say that? He's punching the

506
01:30:38,539 --> 01:30:56,920
air. What do I think of the game so far? Jokes aside. I don't know. See me when I after three

507
01:30:56,920 --> 01:31:16,489
hours. Boring. It's not boring. I can't I'm not saying that yet. Okay, so I go in here or why

508
01:31:17,670 --> 01:31:48,439
in the trash? What am I looking at here? What's what is what's here? The front? The door? Oh,

509
01:31:48,439 --> 01:31:55,590
I tried to click on this. I hit a on this like three times. All right, let's get ready first.

510
01:31:58,390 --> 01:32:20,310
Uh, let me save the game. Go to karaoke. No, hold on. Not yet. That bastard. All right,

511
01:32:20,310 --> 01:32:27,020
let's get some exp. I'm not gonna go play blackjack. Let me play the game first. I'm

512
01:32:27,020 --> 01:32:51,340
not gonna go play blackjack. Go play Mahjong. No, I want to play. Leave me alone. Leave me alone.

513
01:32:51,340 --> 01:33:22,310
Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Oh, my God. I'm sorry, sir. Yeah, good. Well,

514
01:33:22,310 --> 01:33:32,260
you know, let's just do the first mission. Let's do it. I'm ready. Mahjong is more entertaining

515
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:42,680
than the game. There's a great link. No, no, I have to get to the. Okay, I will link this

516
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:54,699
because this is funny. This is funny. It's very good. I feel like I've aged that much too.

517
01:33:58,149 --> 01:34:04,539
What's with the huge amount of subs? Forty two community subs from bingo. Bingo Julius

518
01:34:04,539 --> 01:34:19,800
just gave 42 subs. Oh, my God. That's too many subs. Thank you. Thank you, bingo. That's insane.

519
01:34:20,439 --> 01:34:26,020
Oh, these guys are toast.

520
01:34:57,689 --> 01:34:58,329
Worst joke.

521
01:35:02,329 --> 01:35:13,380
All right, it's time to play the game. We had our fun. Now I want to actually do good.

522
01:35:28,199 --> 01:35:33,720
Breaking. So, um, I have how do I activate the rush? I kind of wasn't paying attention to that.

523
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:51,020
I'll be honest. It is activated. How do I press V? No, no, no, on a controller.

524
01:35:55,340 --> 01:36:12,970
Left on D pad. There it is. Thank you. Any more snacks? What the fuck? All right, here we go,

525
01:36:12,970 --> 01:36:32,569
brother. Oh, that's right. This stances. Right. This game is sick. Oh, I missed the cutscene.

526
01:36:39,300 --> 01:36:47,180
Right in the head. Forced enjoyment. Dude, I'm having so much fun in this game. Sick. Nice. Cool.

527
01:36:47,180 --> 01:37:19,510
Cool. Sick. Sick. It is fun. How do I get health? I'm running out. No way. How'd you make it here?

528
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:23,189
Snacks, right?

529
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:49,750
Tell me everything.

530
01:38:15,380 --> 01:38:16,739
All right, this is what I'm talking about.

531
01:38:19,189 --> 01:38:42,279
Oh,

532
01:38:59,029 --> 01:39:02,069
back in the day, one punch was enough to straighten out little shits like you.

533
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:06,470
What do you mean back in the day? Like when I was a kid? Like when I was like,

534
01:39:06,470 --> 01:39:08,789
how old was I? What the fuck are you talking about?

535
01:39:16,899 --> 01:40:03,180
How long have I known this guy for? He's like in his 50s. Oh, no, not a cigarette.

536
01:40:33,350 --> 01:40:33,989
It's no shame.

537
01:40:40,119 --> 01:40:45,180
You'd listen to this dead air streamer.

538
01:40:54,090 --> 01:41:03,859
Cool.

539
01:41:03,859 --> 01:41:15,140
King of Dead Air. Well, it's a cutscene. Every time I talk over cutscenes, people get so mad at me.

540
01:41:15,779 --> 01:41:33,609
They're like, shut up, you fucking asshole. We're trying to watch the movie.

541
01:41:46,140 --> 01:41:54,520
You can be funny. I'm in a cutscene. I can't. What am I going to do?

542
01:41:56,500 --> 01:42:00,340
Walk up to the TV and like turn it off and turn it on and turn it off and like, no,

543
01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:06,260
like watch the movie. Imagine watching a movie with one of your friends and you're just like,

544
01:42:06,260 --> 01:42:12,520
oh, hey, dude, by the way, like, hey, it'd be funny. What? I guess like, I'm going to stick

545
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:16,279
my tongue out. You're going to get up and like turn the TV off. I'm going to get like pots and

546
01:42:16,279 --> 01:42:54,890
pans in your kitchen and like you just wait.

547
01:43:05,909 --> 01:43:20,729
No, it's fine.

548
01:43:31,140 --> 01:43:34,229
Are you going to cry? No. What?

549
01:43:50,460 --> 01:43:54,710
All right. So I got a spy on this guy, but like, I'm not going to betray my friend.

550
01:43:59,619 --> 01:44:10,710
That's my beeper. 719348. It's not a number I recognize. Who is it? I don't recognize the

551
01:44:10,710 --> 01:44:16,649
number. It's not his number, but that's got to be Nishiki calling. I'll find a phone and call him

552
01:44:16,649 --> 01:44:30,949
back. It has me worried. I got to find a payphone. I am trying to find a payphone. What are you doing?

553
01:44:33,029 --> 01:44:36,890
Oh, it's blocked. Okay. I was going to say there's a save point right there.

554
01:44:36,890 --> 01:45:04,630
Wait. Oh, it's delinquents. Let's go. Come on. Oh, nice. Be a good dog. Get off. What? Oh,

01:45:04,630 --> 01:45:20,170
shit. Why did I swing backwards? I got to spend some money. How much money do I have?

556
01:45:28,939 --> 01:45:36,220
Let me go. Just save it for the debt. No, I want to play. I want to do cool things.

557
01:45:38,420 --> 01:45:41,140
The debt deal. Yeah, I know. I want to like do

558
01:45:42,180 --> 01:46:08,939
slot machines and stuff. Wait, dream machine. How much money do I have? I can't. The debt is

559
01:46:08,939 --> 01:46:25,000
the total collected. Okay. What the office? Okay. What are you doing there?

560
01:46:29,989 --> 01:46:45,979
Hmm. Bingo Julius again. With 18 more subs. Oh my god. 42. That's 52. That's 60.

561
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:58,020
Community subs today. That's a lot of money. Thank you. Bingo Julius. That's insane.

562
01:46:58,020 --> 01:47:27,579
Okay. That's like a green Elmo phone. I've never seen a green phone before like that.

563
01:47:34,890 --> 01:47:41,500
All right. So can I look at the map? Okay. I need to go buy stuff. Okay. Here we go.

564
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:46,729
Hey, our food. Okay. Yeah. This place, the place for soba noodles. We're going there.

565
01:47:47,289 --> 01:48:03,739
Maybe I'll grab a bite at Fuji soba. Yes. Soba and hot broth. This house classic

566
01:48:03,739 --> 01:48:07,420
features freshly boiled soba noodles served in a piping hot homemade soup.

567
01:48:08,949 --> 01:48:27,909
That sounds pretty good. Fried pork cutlet bowl. Yeah. Thank you for waiting. Delicious.

568
01:48:31,369 --> 01:48:38,760
I want another one, but a small one. Have you ever been to Japan? I have not. I've always wanted to

569
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:55,689
go. Let's get the cheap one. I feel like before I die, I want to go to Tokyo. I just want to,

570
01:48:55,689 --> 01:49:14,340
right? There's a lot of places I want to go. Japan sounds cool. I want to go to Europe. I've never

571
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:27,529
left continental North America, guys. It's down here. I want to see, what's this? Sega high tech

572
01:49:27,609 --> 01:49:53,180

573
01:49:53,180 --> 01:50:12,779
This is the door. Left? Wait, I can't go in that door. No, I can't go in any of the doors.

574
01:50:12,779 --> 01:50:35,300
What's over here? I'm going to do the mission. I need to buy healing items. Yeah. I'm going to

575
01:50:35,300 --> 01:50:39,449
go to like the drug store, right? Oh, store. Discount store with many items. Wait, there's

576
01:50:39,449 --> 01:50:55,180
one right here. Convenience store. All right. I'm going to the convenience store. I've got nothing

577
01:50:55,180 --> 01:51:15,939
in my inventory. Grab me a soda. Which one? That one. All right. Hello. Toughness Z comes in handy

578
01:51:15,939 --> 01:51:22,579
when you need a little health boost. Charges up your heat. Stamina X. Charges up your health and

579
01:51:22,579 --> 01:51:28,500
heat a little. That's expensive. Is this kind of like, it's like Final Fantasy. We just buy like

580
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:47,060
a hundred of these. Okay. Also, I want a spicy chashu ramen. We'll get like two of these,

581
01:51:47,060 --> 01:51:58,600
like three of these. I don't know. What else is here? Seaweed rice ball. What do these do?

582
01:51:59,239 --> 01:52:09,909
Oh, bento lunch. Yeah, I'll take five of these. No, I'll take, no, too many. Steamed bun milk. Yeah,

583
01:52:09,909 --> 01:52:28,380
I'll take three milks. Okay. Wait, what? How come I got, did I get some free? I'm stuck in the

584
01:52:28,380 --> 01:52:45,750
grocery store. My body's too big to go walk down the aisle. Go upgrade. Oh, wait, how do I do that?

585
01:52:46,550 --> 01:52:58,920
Equipment abilities. Russian brawler. Okay. How do I, I have to go find his,

586
01:52:58,920 --> 01:53:07,590
that go to that dude's place, right? Yeah, brawler is a lot of fun. What do you want? You got pocket

587
01:53:07,590 --> 01:53:21,350
tissues. You're just, you're just gonna rob me? In abilities. Okay. All right. Brawler. I got a million

588
01:53:21,350 --> 01:53:30,329
yen. Ooh, throw your entire body behind a vicious kick while running. Yep. Either that or max health.

589
01:53:30,329 --> 01:53:48,819
That wasn't very much. All right, we're going to do kick too. I said while running, you do why

590
01:53:48,819 --> 01:54:05,319
and you do a vicious kick. Anything else I can do? No, two million, two million and two million.

591
01:54:05,319 --> 01:54:18,260
All right. I think I'm ready. Wait. Yeah, let's, I want to test it out. Let's go. Toons. That's

592
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:52,840
pretty good. That's pretty good. Nice. It's a fall drop kick. Rush is good with boosting for dodges.

593
01:54:53,479 --> 01:55:04,819
Check for rush. Oh, that's right. Yeah. Yeah. It's a different, it's a completely different tree.

594
01:55:05,380 --> 01:55:13,289
Okay. 400. This is power of your regular attacks and heat actions while using rush style. Cool.

595
01:55:15,750 --> 01:55:40,010
Immediate recover or max health. I mean, just go max health and then max health again. I probably

596
01:55:40,010 --> 01:55:44,810
should, I probably should wait. I don't want to just spend all my points and spread it out too

597
01:55:44,810 --> 01:56:15,369
much. I got to pick one. I'm so switching stances. Not fair. Yeah. I said timeout. Oh, he was

598
01:56:15,369 --> 01:56:40,579
switching stances too. Sorry. He said the same thing. Save it. Money's really easy to get later

599
01:56:40,579 --> 01:57:08,380
on. Cool. I'm into it. Go to the shrine. Uh, the shrine. The shrine? I don't see a shrine. It's

600
01:57:08,380 --> 01:57:27,220
yellow. Theater. You just passed it. Well, I don't know what the hell it is. There's a yellow icon.

601
01:57:27,220 --> 01:57:44,649
It's a store. Oh, okay. Oh, so it's right there. It's behind me. Going the right way, right? Yeah.

602
01:57:44,649 --> 01:58:06,090
All right. Yeah. Oh, I remember this part. Oh, I remember this. Yeah. It's me, Bob. Guess what I

603
01:58:06,090 --> 01:58:22,649
have for you. Dragon of Dojima pack. Kumarucho fun pack. Oh, it's just free. Pocket circuit expert

604
01:58:22,649 --> 01:58:37,529
pack. Um, I guess I'll take the dragon of Dojima pack. Oh, it's an outfit. Modified model gun.

605
01:58:37,529 --> 01:58:56,779
Stone of enduring. You only, you're only getting this once. So take care of it. What? Okay. Exchange.

606
01:58:58,539 --> 01:59:05,529
Gotta go fast. Level one. How much, um, what do I have for CP? I have three. Dash for longer.

607
01:59:05,529 --> 01:59:16,380
Recover more quickly. Money magnet. Gather more money from enemies. Kind of like that one. Oh,

608
01:59:16,380 --> 01:59:35,899
that's six. Hmm. I'm going to hold them. I'm going to hold them for now. Okay. Let's go. Let's start

609
01:59:35,899 --> 02:00:02,260
the mission. I got plenty of items. Save the game first. It's important. Go do karaoke first. No,

610
02:00:02,819 --> 02:00:15,479
I'm not going to do karaoke the first. No, I already did karaoke once. Let's do the mission.

611
02:00:15,560 --> 02:00:24,300
Let's go. I will do karaoke. I'll do all the mini game stuff.

612
02:00:53,260 --> 02:00:54,220
Karaoke now.

613
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:06,420
All right. When I wasn't looking, it kind of sounded like he was ripping a bunch of

614
02:01:06,420 --> 02:01:09,850
tape. He was taping a bunch of shit up on the desk.

615
02:01:23,159 --> 02:01:30,020
Did he ask you to sell out Kazama? He did.

616
02:01:34,630 --> 02:01:35,109
Bastard.

617
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:48,680
Somebody framed him.

618
02:01:57,340 --> 02:02:10,899
Well, you see, it all started when I went into his office and what if it just plays

619
02:02:10,899 --> 02:02:24,539
that cut scene again, but with a filter on it. They would do that.

620
02:02:35,289 --> 02:03:05,270
I had my hand around my neck. It's three. What?

621
02:03:13,420 --> 02:03:19,430
So I was rubbing my neck. I was rubbing and I went like this.

622
02:03:21,590 --> 02:03:27,109
I am paying attention. Yes, I am. He's just choking himself instead of watching the cut

623
02:03:27,109 --> 02:03:42,229
scene. No, I am paying attention to the cut scene. And this dude is fucking strangling himself.

624
02:03:43,989 --> 02:03:46,470
Do you not like the movie? We can put on like designers,

625
02:03:46,470 --> 02:03:51,510
drive-ins and dives if you want. No, man. I love this fucking movie. It's great.

626
02:04:17,699 --> 02:04:36,579
He's choking himself. I can't. I got to mute.

627
02:04:36,579 --> 02:04:37,220
What the hell?

628
02:04:37,220 --> 02:04:49,060
Well, summarize this cut scene. Okay. Yeah, I can.

629
02:04:52,819 --> 02:04:56,579
So this is the boss. This is one of the bosses.

630
02:04:59,029 --> 02:05:02,069
Guys, I don't even know this person's name. I don't know the main character's name.

631
02:05:09,720 --> 02:05:18,600
What's his name? Kiryu. Kiryu. Fuck, I'm sorry.

632
02:05:30,550 --> 02:05:36,439
We're trying to get rid of the other boss. There's three bosses, four bosses.

633
02:05:40,149 --> 02:05:41,590
We're all fighting over the same place.

634
02:05:46,970 --> 02:06:13,029
I'm watching a foreign film without subtitles because I'm like reading chat too. So I'm not

635
02:06:13,029 --> 02:06:21,479
absorbing any of this. Like if it was English, I would be able to hear a lot of this too. I'm

636
02:06:21,880 --> 02:06:29,909
hanging out with you guys reading chat and I'm just hearing Japanese. That's not good.

637
02:06:45,529 --> 02:06:53,220
No, I'm good. I'm good. We got to watch our asses. Watch ourselves.

638
02:06:56,630 --> 02:07:11,979
Focus on the game for 10 minutes. Okay, I will. I swear to God.

639
02:07:13,180 --> 02:07:15,500
I'm not looking at chat. I'm going to focus for 10 straight minutes.

640
02:07:24,899 --> 02:07:29,380
I'm responsible. What am I responsible for? Let's see.

641
02:07:30,180 --> 02:07:34,420
Okay, Kazama. We don't want him to come back to Kazama.

642
02:07:46,460 --> 02:07:47,420
I'm taking the fall for this.

643
02:07:56,500 --> 02:07:57,539
Oh, man. Okay.

644
02:08:07,159 --> 02:08:08,199
I'm going to care this one myself.

645
02:08:08,199 --> 02:08:18,760
All right. So then I'm not tied to like the Yakuza family, right?

646
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:23,159
The Yakuza, right? Okay.

647
02:08:33,960 --> 02:08:35,079
I want out.

648
02:08:41,609 --> 02:08:51,850
Let's go. We're going to settle this right now.

649
02:09:01,819 --> 02:09:07,720
They're framing people. They're framing people.

650
02:09:17,300 --> 02:09:32,439
Whoa.

651
02:09:43,899 --> 02:10:04,710
Okay. He's playing PUBG on his phone right now. If I just had it like the sound effects.

652
02:10:05,670 --> 02:10:20,810
I don't have it installed. Stop reading chat. He was lying on the ground with a painful face.

653
02:10:20,810 --> 02:10:24,250
I can pay attention. I can look away for a second. He's like there's no dialogue there.

654
02:10:27,500 --> 02:10:51,640
And now we're framed for the murder of the guy in the beginning. We're out of the family.

655
02:10:51,640 --> 02:10:58,279
Now we're trying to stop these guys from framing people for murders, especially when it's me.

656
02:10:58,439 --> 02:11:26,979
You can't just leave. You can't get out, right? Let's go.

657
02:11:33,050 --> 02:11:50,949
A bad deal in chat? No, I'm ready. I'm ready to complete.

658
02:11:51,750 --> 02:12:03,829
What was the VOD for the last one? Three hours and what? 335. Okay.

659
02:12:26,279 --> 02:13:01,189
We've looked up to you. Won't let us be in Yakuza.

660
02:13:24,020 --> 02:13:42,300
I thought he was like driving. Is he driving? Pay attention. What the fuck? Oh God. I thought

661
02:13:42,300 --> 02:13:46,779
he was like driving the car and just off. He's in his own world. I'm like holy shit dude. What

662
02:13:46,779 --> 02:14:04,310
are you doing? Finally, you say something. We're watching a fucking cut scene.

663
02:14:16,420 --> 02:14:21,699
Every so often, I'm going to take the back of my hand and get you in the chest.

664
02:14:23,699 --> 02:14:26,899
You see that? They wanted to be Yakuza. I'm paying attention.

665
02:14:30,420 --> 02:14:33,300
This next part, man. I can't wait to pay attention to this part.

666
02:14:48,489 --> 02:14:50,729
He's secretly just leveling in Maldraxxus right now.

667
02:15:04,060 --> 02:15:17,270
Yeah, I'm really going to stop treating the cut scenes in this game like I'm in a league

668
02:15:17,270 --> 02:15:24,119
queue. Yeah, whatever. I'm just going to play like fucking Picross for like 12 minutes until

669
02:15:24,119 --> 02:15:45,210
a queue pops. Oh, there's still a lot of subs that I missed too.

670
02:15:51,420 --> 02:16:07,340
We had five from Swiggity Swanky. Thank you. Five from GrillmasterXBBQ1776. Thank you. Ten from

671
02:16:07,340 --> 02:16:20,149
Zurich. Thanks guys. Three subs. Appreciate it. He's here. I remember this part. I remember giving

672
02:16:20,149 --> 02:16:46,309
up like shortly after this part. Yes, I want out of the family. Spell me. Please let me through.

673
02:16:51,510 --> 02:17:01,049
Ah, ah. What a shame. I shouldn't have said that.

674
02:17:01,049 --> 02:17:02,459
It's my favorite stream zone.

675
02:17:02,459 --> 02:17:04,139
My father's favorite TV show.

676
02:17:04,139 --> 02:17:05,020
Derp on a night five.

677
02:17:06,629 --> 02:17:07,670
If it was a story, I'd like to smell it.

678
02:17:07,670 --> 02:17:11,750
Plus two. Plus two. Plus two. Plus two. Plus two. Plus two. That was really funny. Plus two.

679
02:17:18,709 --> 02:17:20,309
You don't even have a lot of money.

680
02:17:22,040 --> 02:17:27,719
You're just saying hello to me with your bare hands. Are you kidding me?

681
02:17:30,329 --> 02:17:35,540
I'm not here to talk to you. Where's the head of the gang?

682
02:17:35,540 --> 02:17:39,420
I'm the one who's in charge of the gang right now.

683
02:17:41,979 --> 02:17:43,979
I'll be careful with the way you talk.

684
02:17:59,909 --> 02:18:01,909
You're a good boy.

685
02:18:01,909 --> 02:18:03,909
I won't bring any money.

686
02:18:03,909 --> 02:18:08,569
I just want to say hello to you.

687
02:18:08,569 --> 02:18:18,870
Hey!

688
02:18:18,870 --> 02:18:22,840
If you want to be a student, go ahead.

689
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:24,840
The world of Gokudo isn't that bad.

690
02:18:42,520 --> 02:18:45,780
I'm going to get rid of everything now.

691
02:18:46,420 --> 02:18:50,620
I'm still here to listen to the news.

692
02:18:50,620 --> 02:18:51,739
40 minutes until the stream ends.

693
02:18:51,739 --> 02:18:53,659

So you're going to see the boss of the gang?

He came to take your permission.

697

700
02:19:20,469 --> 02:19:25,430

02:47:00,940 --> 02:47:27,079
No, this is not the Simpsons episode part.

766
02:47:28,079 --> 02:47:36,520
Hmm, as of today, you are expelled from the family.

767
02:47:36,520 --> 02:47:48,040
Thanks, but I just want to let you know, I'm coming for all of you. Eventually.

768
02:48:11,959 --> 02:48:28,069
Oh, thanks for like the tweet explaining the story.

769
02:48:28,069 --> 02:48:33,069
I didn't know anything up till right now.

770
02:48:33,069 --> 02:48:42,879
Perfect, I know exactly what's going on now.

771
02:48:57,629 --> 02:49:23,489
Killer.

772
02:49:38,620 --> 02:49:53,799
Simpsons.

773
02:50:14,889 --> 02:50:58,049
That's pretty good episode.

774
02:50:58,049 --> 02:51:03,049
Stream. Oh my God, stream is gone.

775
02:51:03,049 --> 02:51:09,290
It's over. Oh shit, I forgot.

776
02:51:09,290 --> 02:51:15,680
It's no sorry. I was playing it through the microphone. I was playing it through the microphone.

777
02:51:15,680 --> 02:51:20,049
It doesn't matter. That was me singing that. There's me humming it with my mouth.

778
02:51:20,049 --> 02:51:42,090
Was this like a jazz version? What is this?

779
02:51:42,090 --> 02:51:48,229
This doesn't happen in the Simpsons theme song.

780
02:51:48,229 --> 02:52:01,399
This is not the Simpsons theme song. That's like a completely different version.

781
02:52:01,399 --> 02:52:04,399
Look at the game. Oh, right. All right, we got an umbrella.

782
02:52:04,399 --> 02:52:06,399
Somebody under an umbrella and they're teaching us something.

783
02:52:06,399 --> 02:52:09,399
They've been waiting for us for a long time.

784
02:52:09,399 --> 02:52:35,299
I've been waiting. Yes, I knew it.

785
02:52:35,299 --> 02:52:41,690
Chapter one. 12 million, 12 million yen. Nice.

786
02:52:41,690 --> 02:52:47,920
IMAX battles have opened. Save it.

787
02:52:47,920 --> 02:52:54,850
Chapter two, the real estate broker in the shadows. Cool.

788
02:52:54,850 --> 02:53:44,069
Big windows. I talked about that already.

789
02:53:44,069 --> 02:53:52,000
I don't think you can see everything.

790
02:53:52,000 --> 02:54:01,930
You're just a giant TV show for everybody that looks up.

791
02:54:01,930 --> 02:54:05,000
There's no danger to me.

792
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:16,360
Mr. Kiryu, please relax.

793
02:54:16,360 --> 02:54:19,940
Tinted? Well, all right.

794
02:54:19,940 --> 02:54:25,360
So sure. Tinted windows. Would you stand naked in front of that window?

795
02:54:25,360 --> 02:54:27,360
No, you wouldn't.

796
02:54:27,360 --> 02:54:29,920
I'll pay you back right away.

797
02:54:29,920 --> 02:54:34,270
Mr. Tachibana.

798
02:54:34,270 --> 02:54:38,219
Yes, please rest assured.

799
02:54:38,219 --> 02:54:40,520
I am a man of my own.

800
02:54:40,520 --> 02:54:45,149
In Kamurocho, I'm asking for real estate.

801
02:54:45,149 --> 02:54:48,899
Real estate? What does that look like to me?

802
02:54:48,899 --> 02:54:52,530
You really don't eat?

803
02:54:52,530 --> 02:54:54,530
What's for dinner?

804
02:54:54,530 --> 02:55:09,879
What do we have?

805
02:55:09,879 --> 02:55:11,559
What do we have?

806
02:55:11,559 --> 02:55:16,809
The right hand is a technique.

807
02:55:16,809 --> 02:55:19,239
It's a way to forgive.

808
02:55:19,239 --> 02:55:23,930
After losing it a few years ago, it hurts when it gets cold.

809
02:55:23,930 --> 02:55:26,110
It's a strange thing.

810
02:55:26,110 --> 02:55:29,110
It doesn't work on the fingertips, and it doesn't work on the painkillers.

811
02:55:29,110 --> 02:55:32,110
I just endure the pain in the middle of the day.

812
02:55:32,110 --> 02:55:37,110
But it's a hassle to put pain on my face, so I quit.

813
02:55:37,110 --> 02:55:40,409
I didn't hear that.

814
02:55:40,409 --> 02:55:45,590
Mr. Kiryu, do you know the word Tojo Kajo?

815
02:55:45,590 --> 02:55:47,590
Tojo?

816
02:55:47,590 --> 02:55:48,590
Tojo.

817
02:55:48,590 --> 02:55:50,020
Tojo Kajo.

818
02:55:50,020 --> 02:55:56,020
Many flowers gather together and become one big flower.

819
02:55:56,020 --> 02:56:01,450
In fact, some of the flowers you know are Tojo Kajo.

820
02:56:01,450 --> 02:56:03,879
What are you talking about?

821
02:56:03,879 --> 02:56:06,829
It's a sunflower.

822
02:56:08,709 --> 02:56:10,709
That's true.

823
02:56:10,709 --> 02:56:12,709
They're beautiful. That's true.

824
02:56:12,709 --> 02:56:16,709
It's a good name to use for a child's kindergarten.

825
02:56:16,709 --> 02:56:21,290
Kazama-san named you sunflower?

826
02:56:21,290 --> 02:56:22,290
You.

827
02:56:22,290 --> 02:56:30,319
You grew up with Nishikiyama-san and your brothers in sunflower.

828
02:56:30,319 --> 02:56:31,680
Another one.

829
02:56:31,680 --> 02:56:34,860
Yumi Sawamura-san, a young lady.

830
02:56:34,860 --> 02:56:40,420
Eventually, you and Nishikiyama-san followed Kazama-san as parents.

831
02:56:40,420 --> 02:56:43,420
Then you entered the world of Jokudo.

832
02:56:43,420 --> 02:56:47,420
And now you're wearing a murder suit.

833
02:56:47,420 --> 02:56:52,420
Because of that, Kazama-san is in danger.

834
02:56:52,420 --> 02:56:54,420
I know what my life was.

835
02:56:54,420 --> 02:56:57,659
I understand that you investigated me.

836
02:56:57,659 --> 02:57:01,159
You have a lot of information.

837
02:57:01,159 --> 02:57:03,649
But why did you investigate me?

838
02:57:03,649 --> 02:57:06,649
What is your purpose?

839
02:57:06,649 --> 02:57:08,829
You don't know, he knows.

840
02:57:08,829 --> 02:57:10,829
No, that's right.

841
02:57:18,079 --> 02:57:20,079
Empty lot.

842
02:57:25,899 --> 02:57:26,899
That bread.

843
02:57:26,899 --> 02:57:29,840
I want that bread right now.

844
02:57:35,209 --> 02:57:40,209
If we get the empty lot, then Kazama's expulsion is guaranteed.

845
02:57:44,399 --> 02:57:48,079
If we don't get rid of your eagerness.

846
02:57:48,079 --> 02:57:52,260
Our information in Kamurocho is a little bit.

847
02:57:52,260 --> 02:57:57,379
If you join hands with me, you can definitely finish the criminal.

848
02:57:57,379 --> 02:58:00,750
Why are you trying to drag me into this?

849
02:58:01,750 --> 02:58:03,750
What is your real purpose?

850
02:58:07,969 --> 02:58:09,969
Give me back my clothes, Tachibana-san.

851
02:58:09,969 --> 02:58:13,040
I'm begging you.

852
02:58:13,040 --> 02:58:14,040
Kobamuto.

853
02:58:14,040 --> 02:58:18,239
Your story is too convenient for me.

854
02:58:18,239 --> 02:58:23,239
At times like this, you have to be careful.

855
02:58:23,239 --> 02:58:25,239
There's no way you can survive.

856
02:58:27,239 --> 02:58:28,239
I see.

857
02:58:28,239 --> 02:58:32,430
It seems you've been looking a little too sweet.

858
02:58:32,430 --> 02:58:35,430
But I believe you'll think about it some day.

859
02:58:35,430 --> 02:58:40,239
At least, can you take this card with you?

860
02:58:40,239 --> 02:58:46,459
I understand.

861
02:58:46,459 --> 02:58:48,459
I'll bring the clothes right away.

862
02:58:48,459 --> 02:58:52,959
Well then, I'll be going.

863
02:58:57,329 --> 02:58:58,329
That's not necessarily true.

864
02:58:58,329 --> 02:59:00,329
I mean, look at Metal Gear Solid 3.

865
02:59:00,329 --> 02:59:01,329
Metal Gear Solid 4.

866
02:59:01,329 --> 02:59:05,760
Wasn't that game like 4 hours of cutscenes before you pressed B to punch anybody?

867
02:59:05,760 --> 02:59:23,110
Look at that series, right?

868
02:59:23,110 --> 02:59:24,110
Alright, so here we are.

869
02:59:24,110 --> 02:59:26,989
Let's save it.

870
02:59:26,989 --> 02:59:29,739
Is the arcade open?

871
02:59:29,739 --> 02:59:31,739
If it is, you know exactly where I'm going.

872
02:59:31,739 --> 02:59:45,819
Alright, so let's take a look at the map.

873
02:59:45,819 --> 02:59:53,750
Alright, so we have Sega High Tech Land and the bowling alley.

874
02:59:53,750 --> 02:59:55,750
I want to go to High Tech Land.

875
02:59:55,750 --> 03:00:07,719
Is this Sega High Tech Land?

876
03:00:07,719 --> 03:00:09,340
No?

877
03:00:09,340 --> 03:00:11,989
Wait, did I?

878
03:00:11,989 --> 03:00:13,290
Okay, yeah, that's it.

879
03:00:13,290 --> 03:00:14,290
Where is it?

880
03:00:14,290 --> 03:00:17,709
Wrong way?

881
03:00:17,709 --> 03:00:19,909
Entrance is on the other side.

882
03:00:19,909 --> 03:00:20,909
Oh.

883
03:00:20,909 --> 03:00:25,350
I don't have time to fight you.

884
03:00:25,350 --> 03:00:27,350
I want to play video games.

885
03:00:27,350 --> 03:00:29,360
Leave me alone.

886
03:00:29,360 --> 03:00:31,360
This is dumb.

887
03:00:31,360 --> 03:00:33,360
No, it's not.

888
03:00:33,360 --> 03:00:38,569
Yes.

889
03:00:38,569 --> 03:00:39,569
Okay, I've never done this before.

890
03:00:39,569 --> 03:00:40,569
Is this fun in here?

891
03:00:40,569 --> 03:00:45,500
Oh my god, yes.

892
03:00:45,500 --> 03:00:48,079
How much is it?

893
03:00:48,079 --> 03:00:50,579
300 yen for three games.

894
03:00:50,579 --> 03:00:51,579
Let's go.

895
03:00:51,579 --> 03:00:59,200
Okay, Move Claw.

896
03:00:59,200 --> 03:01:03,120
That's it right there.

897
03:01:03,120 --> 03:01:04,120
I got it.

898
03:01:04,120 --> 03:01:05,620
And that's a pink one too.

899
03:01:05,620 --> 03:01:06,620
It's rare.

900
03:01:06,620 --> 03:01:07,620
It's worth so much more.

901
03:01:07,620 --> 03:01:08,620
I'll take it.

902
03:01:08,620 --> 03:01:17,350
What's it worth?

903
03:01:17,350 --> 03:01:20,760
Funchan.

904
03:01:20,760 --> 03:01:22,069
Nice.

905
03:01:22,069 --> 03:01:23,069
Alright, cool.

906
03:01:23,069 --> 03:01:24,069
I got two more.

907
03:01:24,069 --> 03:01:27,780
Give me the other pink one.

908
03:01:27,780 --> 03:01:28,780
Nope, I fucked it up.

909
03:01:28,780 --> 03:01:29,780
I might still get it.

910
03:01:29,780 --> 03:01:33,200
It's possible.

911
03:01:33,200 --> 03:01:34,200
I might get it.

912
03:01:34,200 --> 03:01:44,139
Oh, I got to get him.

913
03:01:44,139 --> 03:01:45,139
He's hanging out back there.

914
03:01:45,139 --> 03:01:46,139
I have to get him.

915
03:01:46,139 --> 03:01:50,520
That's a good start.

916
03:01:50,520 --> 03:01:51,520
There it is.

917
03:01:51,520 --> 03:01:54,870
I'll take it home with me.

918
03:01:54,870 --> 03:01:55,870
I'm going to put it on the wall.

919
03:01:55,870 --> 03:01:58,360
That's the one right there.

920
03:01:58,360 --> 03:01:59,360
Scoop him.

921
03:01:59,360 --> 03:02:01,180
Yes.

922
03:02:01,180 --> 03:02:02,930
Oh, it's alright.

923
03:02:02,930 --> 03:02:06,409
I got one.

924
03:02:06,409 --> 03:02:10,280
It's alright.

925
03:02:10,280 --> 03:02:11,280
I got one.

926
03:02:11,280 --> 03:02:12,280
What else is in here?

927
03:02:12,280 --> 03:02:13,450
Can I play these?

928
03:02:13,450 --> 03:02:14,450
Is this Galaga?

929
03:02:14,450 --> 03:02:15,450
Space Harrier.

930
03:02:15,450 --> 03:02:20,340
100 to play.

931
03:02:20,340 --> 03:02:21,340
Of course I do.

932
03:02:21,340 --> 03:02:22,340
I'll give it a go.

933
03:02:22,340 --> 03:02:23,340
Space Harrier?

934
03:02:23,340 --> 03:02:25,799
Fire.

935
03:02:25,799 --> 03:02:30,489
Select.

936
03:02:30,489 --> 03:02:31,489
Insert.

937
03:02:31,489 --> 03:02:33,950
Credit.

938
03:02:33,950 --> 03:02:39,219
Rapid fire.

939
03:02:39,219 --> 03:02:40,219
Switch screen type.

940
03:02:40,219 --> 03:02:41,590
Okay.

941
03:02:41,590 --> 03:02:42,590
Whatever.

942
03:02:42,590 --> 03:02:43,590
How many coins should I put in?

943
03:02:43,590 --> 03:02:44,889
Controls are reversed.

944
03:02:44,889 --> 03:02:46,840
This is a real Sega game, isn't it?

945
03:02:46,840 --> 03:02:47,840
Oh, dude.

946
03:02:47,840 --> 03:02:50,360
Play Tohoku!

947
03:02:50,360 --> 03:02:51,360
Play Tohoku!

948
03:02:51,360 --> 03:02:53,620
Play Tohoku!

949
03:02:54,920 --> 03:03:08,129
Controls are reversed.

950
03:03:08,129 --> 03:03:09,129
This is a real Sega game, isn't it?

951
03:03:09,129 --> 03:03:16,319
Oh, dude.

952
03:03:16,319 --> 03:03:17,319
Play Tohoku!

953
03:03:17,319 --> 03:03:26,879
Play Tohoku!

954
03:03:26,879 --> 03:03:27,879
Play Tohoku!

955
03:03:27,879 --> 03:03:28,879
You love Tohoku.

956
03:03:28,879 --> 03:03:29,879
You love Tohoku.

957
03:03:29,879 --> 03:03:31,700
Oh, why has he not played it yet?

958
03:03:31,700 --> 03:03:32,700
No, no, no.

959
03:03:32,700 --> 03:03:33,700
Don't play the first one.

960
03:03:33,700 --> 03:03:37,120
Don't play the second one.

961
03:03:37,120 --> 03:03:38,120
There's a third version of the 17th game.

962
03:03:38,120 --> 03:03:40,250
That's the one you should play.

963
03:03:40,250 --> 03:03:41,250
That's the best music.

964
03:03:41,250 --> 03:03:42,250
Don't play the other one.

965
03:03:42,250 --> 03:03:43,250
No, no, no, no, no.

966
03:03:43,250 --> 03:03:44,250
Tohoku 16 version 4.

967
03:03:44,250 --> 03:03:45,250
No, no, no.

968
03:03:45,250 --> 03:03:46,250
Not that one.

969
03:03:46,250 --> 03:03:47,559
Shoot him in the head, right?

970
03:03:47,559 --> 03:03:48,559
I might break through his skin.

971
03:03:48,559 --> 03:03:49,559
I might break through his skin.

972
03:03:49,559 --> 03:03:50,559
I might break through his skin.

973
03:03:50,559 --> 03:03:51,559
I might break through his skin.

974
03:04:20,889 --> 03:04:21,889
Oh, wait.

975
03:04:21,889 --> 03:04:23,899
It's in the head.

976
03:04:23,899 --> 03:04:24,899
I win.

977
03:04:24,899 --> 03:04:26,329
Stage 2.

978
03:04:26,329 --> 03:04:27,329
Let's go.

979
03:04:27,329 --> 03:04:28,889
How many stages are in this game?

980
03:04:28,889 --> 03:04:35,250
One?

981
03:04:35,250 --> 03:04:49,549
It's kind of loud and it hurts my ears.

982
03:04:49,549 --> 03:04:50,549
I'm sorry if it's happening to you too.

983
03:04:50,549 --> 03:04:57,799
It's very painful.

984
03:04:57,799 --> 03:04:59,239
You can't even fucking buy dodges like this one, bro.

985
03:04:59,239 --> 03:05:00,239
You can't even buy dodges like this one.

986
03:05:00,239 --> 03:05:01,239
They're not.

987
03:05:01,239 --> 03:05:02,239
They're not.

988
03:05:02,239 --> 03:05:03,239
Come on.

989
03:05:03,239 --> 03:05:04,239
Ooh.

990
03:05:04,239 --> 03:05:15,459
Ooh.

991
03:05:15,459 --> 03:05:16,459
How do I know?

992
03:05:16,459 --> 03:05:17,459
I don't know.

993
03:05:17,459 --> 03:05:31,500
I don't know.

994
03:05:31,500 --> 03:05:32,500
I don't know.

995
03:05:32,500 --> 03:05:33,500
I don't know.

996
03:05:33,500 --> 03:05:34,500
I don't know.

997
03:05:34,500 --> 03:05:35,930
I don't know.

998
03:05:35,930 --> 03:05:46,129
I don't know.

999
03:05:46,129 --> 03:05:47,129
I don't know.

1000
03:05:47,129 --> 03:05:51,120
I don't know.

1001
03:05:58,889 --> 03:05:59,889
How do I know?

1002
03:05:59,889 --> 03:06:00,889
How do I get out?

1003
03:06:00,889 --> 03:06:01,889
I don't want to play.

1004
03:06:01,889 --> 03:06:02,889
Whoa.

1005
03:06:02,889 --> 03:06:03,889
What the fuck was that?

1006
03:06:03,889 --> 03:06:04,889
Welcome to the family.

1007
03:06:04,889 --> 03:06:05,889
Get ready.

1008
03:06:05,889 --> 03:06:06,889
Let's go.

1009
03:06:06,889 --> 03:06:12,790
Give me up.

1010
03:06:12,790 --> 03:06:15,180
M.

1011
03:06:15,180 --> 03:06:16,180
How do I quit?

1012
03:06:16,180 --> 03:06:18,440
How do I leave?

1013
03:06:18,440 --> 03:06:23,819
I want to do that thing where you buy, you put like five quarters into the machine and

1014
03:06:23,819 --> 03:06:25,100
you have to leave the arcade.

1015
03:06:25,100 --> 03:06:27,420
So you're just like, no, but I can't leave.

1016
03:06:27,420 --> 03:06:32,100
There's like five, there's five credits in here, but you have to fucking go.

1017
03:06:32,100 --> 03:06:33,100
And your mom's like, get in the car.

1018
03:06:33,100 --> 03:06:34,100
We've got to fucking go now.

1019
03:06:34,100 --> 03:06:35,100
And it's like, fine.

1020
03:06:35,340 --> 03:06:39,020
And you leave and then some kid comes over and it's like, holy shit.

1021
03:06:39,020 --> 03:06:41,840
This one's got credits in it.

1022
03:06:41,840 --> 03:06:43,930
A bunch of them.

1023
03:06:43,930 --> 03:06:48,899
You make somebody's day when you do that.

1024
03:06:48,899 --> 03:06:49,899
It's so loud.

1025
03:06:49,899 --> 03:06:51,329
I have to stop.

1026
03:06:51,329 --> 03:06:58,780
How do I get out?

1027
03:06:58,780 --> 03:06:59,959
The back button?

1028
03:06:59,959 --> 03:07:04,139
That was fun.

1029
03:07:04,139 --> 03:07:06,600
What else is in here?

1030
03:07:06,600 --> 03:07:10,010
Welcome to Sega arcade.

1031
03:07:10,010 --> 03:07:13,090
What can I do for you?

1032
03:07:13,090 --> 03:07:14,569
Change UFO catcher prizes.

1033
03:07:14,569 --> 03:07:26,389
I think it needs new prizes.

1034
03:07:26,389 --> 03:07:27,389
That's kind of annoying.

1035
03:07:27,389 --> 03:07:34,129
What's this?

1036
03:07:34,129 --> 03:07:35,129
Can I do this one?

1037
03:07:35,129 --> 03:07:36,129
No.

1038
03:07:39,469 --> 03:07:43,520
Only two games in here?

1039
03:07:43,520 --> 03:07:46,520
Only two games in here?

1040
03:07:46,520 --> 03:07:47,520
What's this bullshit?

1041
03:07:47,520 --> 03:07:49,780
Wait a minute.

1042
03:07:49,780 --> 03:08:01,959
I have to get the egg.

1043
03:08:01,959 --> 03:08:05,569
That's a win.

1044
03:08:05,569 --> 03:08:06,569
That's a win.

1045
03:08:06,569 --> 03:08:07,569
That's a win.

1046
03:08:07,569 --> 03:08:08,569
It is.

1047
03:08:08,569 --> 03:08:09,569
I got it.

1048
03:08:09,569 --> 03:08:10,569
I got it.

1049
03:08:10,569 --> 03:08:11,569
I got it.

1050
03:08:11,569 --> 03:08:16,010
I got it.

1051
03:08:16,010 --> 03:08:17,010
I got it.

1052
03:08:17,010 --> 03:08:21,069
I got it.

1053
03:08:21,069 --> 03:08:22,069
I got it.

1054
03:08:22,069 --> 03:08:29,450
I got it.

1055
03:08:29,450 --> 03:08:32,159
I got it.

1056
03:08:32,159 --> 03:08:33,159
I got it.

1057
03:08:33,159 --> 03:08:34,159
I got it.

1058
03:08:34,159 --> 03:08:39,819
I got it.

1059
03:08:39,819 --> 03:08:57,440
I got it.

1060
03:08:57,440 --> 03:09:00,479
I got it.

1061
03:09:00,479 --> 03:09:01,479
I got it.

1062
03:09:01,479 --> 03:09:02,479
I got it.

1063
03:09:02,479 --> 03:09:03,479
I got it.

1064
03:09:03,600 --> 03:09:04,600
I got it.

1065
03:09:04,600 --> 03:09:05,600
I got it.

1066
03:09:05,600 --> 03:09:06,600
I got it.

1067
03:09:06,600 --> 03:09:07,600
I got it.

1068
03:09:07,600 --> 03:09:08,600
I got it.

1069
03:09:08,600 --> 03:09:09,600
I got it.

1070
03:09:09,600 --> 03:09:14,420
I got it.

1071
03:09:14,420 --> 03:09:15,420
I got it.

1072
03:09:15,420 --> 03:09:17,879
I got it.

1073
03:09:17,879 --> 03:09:19,120
I got it.

1074
03:09:19,120 --> 03:09:20,739
I got it.

1075
03:09:20,739 --> 03:09:21,739
I got it.

1076
03:09:21,739 --> 03:09:22,739
I got it.

1077
03:09:22,739 --> 03:09:23,739
I got it.

1078
03:09:23,739 --> 03:09:24,739
I got it.

1079
03:09:24,739 --> 03:09:31,159
I got it.

1080
03:09:31,159 --> 03:09:32,159
I got it.

1081
03:09:32,159 --> 03:09:40,760
I got it.

1082
03:09:40,760 --> 03:09:42,709
I got it.

1083
03:09:42,709 --> 03:09:43,709
I got it.

1084
03:09:43,709 --> 03:09:49,170
I got it.

1085
03:09:49,170 --> 03:09:50,170
I got it.

1086
03:09:50,170 --> 03:09:52,819
I got it.

1087
03:09:52,819 --> 03:09:59,559
I got it.

1088
03:09:59,559 --> 03:10:00,559
I got it.

1089
03:10:00,559 --> 03:10:01,559
I got it.

1090
03:10:01,559 --> 03:10:02,559
I got it.

1091
03:10:02,559 --> 03:10:04,059
I got it.

1092
03:10:04,059 --> 03:10:05,059
I got it.

1093
03:10:05,180 --> 03:10:07,829
All right.

1094
03:10:07,829 --> 03:10:08,829
We got a lizard.

1095
03:10:08,829 --> 03:10:14,040
OK.

1096
03:10:14,040 --> 03:10:18,520
Now we're going to get the whatever this is back here.

1097
03:10:18,520 --> 03:10:26,520
Perfect.

1098
03:10:26,520 --> 03:10:28,600
Get it.

1099
03:10:28,600 --> 03:10:29,600
No.

1100
03:10:29,600 --> 03:10:30,600
Come on.

1101
03:10:30,600 --> 03:10:34,459
Just throw it in there.

1102
03:10:34,459 --> 03:10:35,459
Yes.

1103
03:10:35,459 --> 03:10:46,299
And the blue one.

1104
03:10:46,299 --> 03:10:48,370
That's pretty good.

1105
03:10:48,370 --> 03:10:52,110
Get the other lizards.

1106
03:10:52,110 --> 03:10:53,110
I got his hat.

1107
03:10:53,110 --> 03:10:54,729
Come on.

1108
03:10:54,729 --> 03:10:55,729
Just drag him over there.

1109
03:10:55,729 --> 03:11:00,090
Yes.

1110
03:11:00,090 --> 03:11:05,250
Just go get every prize and then go over to the guy and go, hey, can you refill the prizes?

1111
03:11:05,250 --> 03:11:09,709
It's like, how did you glitch this out or like hack this?

1112
03:11:09,709 --> 03:11:11,909
Are you selling these?

1113
03:11:11,989 --> 03:11:12,989
What are you doing?

1114
03:11:12,989 --> 03:11:16,719
All right.

1115
03:11:16,719 --> 03:11:17,719
This could be a double.

1116
03:11:17,719 --> 03:11:22,420
Possible.

1117
03:11:22,420 --> 03:11:23,420
I hit the lip.

1118
03:11:23,420 --> 03:11:27,280
Shit.

1119
03:11:27,280 --> 03:11:28,280
I can do it.

1120
03:11:28,280 --> 03:11:29,280
I just have a handful of prizes.

1121
03:11:29,280 --> 03:11:31,280
There's a five-year-old behind me.

1122
03:11:31,280 --> 03:11:35,399
That's going to happen again.

1123
03:11:35,399 --> 03:11:36,399
It's going to happen again.

1124
03:11:36,399 --> 03:11:37,399
Shit.

1125
03:11:37,399 --> 03:11:44,590
I'm an idiot.

1126
03:11:44,590 --> 03:11:45,590
Oh, yes.

1127
03:11:45,590 --> 03:11:54,059
It still worked.

1128
03:11:54,059 --> 03:11:55,059
Cleaning out my local.

1129
03:11:55,059 --> 03:11:59,049
Whoa.

1130
03:11:59,049 --> 03:12:01,049
Oh, I have this actually in my inventory.

1131
03:12:01,049 --> 03:12:03,440
OK.

1132
03:12:03,440 --> 03:12:04,440
We're going to replace.

1133
03:12:04,440 --> 03:12:05,440
I don't know.

1134
03:12:05,440 --> 03:12:07,709
One of these.

1135
03:12:07,709 --> 03:12:09,709
Just put a health potion in there.

1136
03:12:09,709 --> 03:12:27,180
Put it back in the machine.

1137
03:12:27,180 --> 03:12:30,850
Yeah.

1138
03:12:31,370 --> 03:12:33,370
Why is there booze in this machine?

1139
03:12:33,370 --> 03:12:43,700
There's a bottle of vodka in here.

1140
03:12:43,700 --> 03:12:46,989
Get his arm.

1141
03:12:46,989 --> 03:12:48,510
Yes, I got his arm.

1142
03:12:48,510 --> 03:12:51,379
All three lizards are mine.

1143
03:12:51,379 --> 03:12:52,379
What a deal.

1144
03:12:52,379 --> 03:12:54,200
What's the deal?

1145
03:12:54,200 --> 03:12:55,629
Let's see.

1146
03:12:55,629 --> 03:13:01,770
Look at this image for a hundred million off your extraordinary debt.

1147
03:13:01,770 --> 03:13:03,129
That's too easy.

1148
03:13:03,129 --> 03:13:08,040
I mean, that's too easy.

1149
03:13:08,040 --> 03:13:12,030
Wrong one?

1150
03:13:12,030 --> 03:13:13,030
No.

1151
03:13:13,030 --> 03:13:14,030
New deal.

1152
03:13:14,030 --> 03:13:18,569
When Mr. Green plays gaming games, total is doubled.

1153
03:13:18,569 --> 03:13:21,649
When he plays gambling games, what do you mean?

1154
03:13:21,649 --> 03:13:22,649
That's not...

1155
03:13:22,649 --> 03:13:23,649
Wrong one again.

1156
03:13:23,649 --> 03:13:27,319
Get offer.

1157
03:13:27,319 --> 03:13:28,319
Made you look.

1158
03:13:28,319 --> 03:13:29,319
There are no offers.

1159
03:13:29,319 --> 03:13:31,719
People need to stop spamming links so much these days.

1160
03:13:31,719 --> 03:13:34,479
Play Pathologic and Pathologic 2.

1161
03:13:34,479 --> 03:13:46,270
Time that person out for an hour.

1162
03:13:46,270 --> 03:13:49,270
You got your game shout out.

1163
03:13:49,270 --> 03:14:02,409
I'll have an opportunity.

1164
03:14:02,409 --> 03:14:05,409
Might as well just try to get everything.

1165
03:14:05,409 --> 03:14:18,319
Oh, can I sell these?

1166
03:14:18,319 --> 03:14:28,969
What do I do with them?

1167
03:14:28,969 --> 03:14:32,049
Go do karaoke?

1168
03:14:32,049 --> 03:14:33,049
I will.

1169
03:14:33,049 --> 03:14:43,319
I will.

1170
03:14:43,319 --> 03:14:46,079
Pathologic was one of the most awful games I have ever played.

1171
03:14:46,079 --> 03:14:47,079
Jesus.

1172
03:14:47,079 --> 03:14:50,430
All right, let's go do some other fun toy stuff.

1173
03:14:50,430 --> 03:14:52,129
Can I play this one?

1174
03:14:52,129 --> 03:14:58,750
No.

1175
03:14:58,750 --> 03:15:09,260
What are some of the toys I can play with?

1176
03:15:09,260 --> 03:15:15,049
Hi-tech bowling alley.

1177
03:15:15,049 --> 03:15:16,049
Batting practice.

1178
03:15:16,049 --> 03:15:25,159
Yep.

1179
03:15:25,159 --> 03:15:30,670
Dude, I used to go to the batting cages and just absolutely destroy.

1180
03:15:30,670 --> 03:15:32,430
There'd be a 14-year-old next to me.

1181
03:15:32,430 --> 03:15:36,829
There'd be like an 18-year-old in the other cage and I'd be in the middle and I would

1182
03:15:36,829 --> 03:15:38,670
just be hitting fucking home runs.

1183
03:15:38,670 --> 03:15:48,069
I'd be destroying.

1184
03:15:48,069 --> 03:15:49,870
I would hit the net.

1185
03:15:49,870 --> 03:15:53,149
I would hit the back net in the cages every time.

1186
03:15:53,149 --> 03:16:05,030
Getting a high score coming to cool prizes.

1187
03:16:05,030 --> 03:16:07,309
I don't care about your prizes.

1188
03:16:07,309 --> 03:16:08,309
I care about winning.

1189
03:16:08,309 --> 03:16:11,879
I don't want the prize.

1190
03:16:11,879 --> 03:16:12,879
I just want to win.

1191
03:16:12,879 --> 03:16:15,329
Advanced.

1192
03:16:15,329 --> 03:16:16,329
No, no, let's start easy.

1193
03:16:16,329 --> 03:16:27,469
Let's go to the one that I would go to, the one that just lobs them so you can just...

1194
03:16:27,469 --> 03:16:35,879
You're essentially just chopping wood.

1195
03:16:35,879 --> 03:16:46,370
I'm going to just swing as hard as I can and just break this wooden half.

1196
03:16:46,409 --> 03:16:47,969
I think I would really love that, by the way.

1197
03:16:47,969 --> 03:16:51,500
I probably should have figured out how to play first.

1198
03:16:51,500 --> 03:16:52,500
Oh, no.

1199
03:16:52,500 --> 03:16:53,500
Do I?

1200
03:16:53,500 --> 03:16:54,500
No, I don't.

1201
03:16:54,500 --> 03:16:55,500
That's so loud.

1202
03:16:55,500 --> 03:16:56,500
Holy fuck, that's horrible.

1203
03:16:56,500 --> 03:16:58,100
I got to hold on a minute.

1204
03:16:58,100 --> 03:16:59,100
That actually hurt my head.

1205
03:16:59,100 --> 03:17:00,100
That was painful.

1206
03:17:00,100 --> 03:17:03,959
That's better.

1207
03:17:03,959 --> 03:17:10,770
That's very slow.

1208
03:17:10,770 --> 03:17:11,770
That was very slow.

1209
03:17:11,770 --> 03:17:14,040
I didn't even see it go by.

1210
03:17:14,040 --> 03:17:15,040
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1211
03:17:15,040 --> 03:17:16,040
Let me just do the training first.

1212
03:17:16,040 --> 03:17:17,040
Let me do the training.

1213
03:17:17,040 --> 03:17:22,950
How to play.

1214
03:17:22,950 --> 03:17:23,950
Press A at the right time.

1215
03:17:23,989 --> 03:17:24,989
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1216
03:17:24,989 --> 03:17:26,709
Let me just do the training first.

1217
03:17:26,709 --> 03:17:27,709
Let me do the training.

1218
03:17:27,709 --> 03:17:31,190
Let me do the training.

1219
03:17:31,190 --> 03:17:32,190
How to play.

1220
03:17:32,190 --> 03:17:37,340
Press A at the right timing to hit balls, of course.

1221
03:17:37,340 --> 03:17:39,350
Okay.

1222
03:17:39,350 --> 03:17:41,870
Okay.

1223
03:17:41,870 --> 03:17:44,959
Okay.

1224
03:17:44,959 --> 03:17:47,930
Okay.

1225
03:17:47,930 --> 03:17:49,680
Okay.

1226
03:17:49,680 --> 03:17:54,569
Okay.

1227
03:17:54,569 --> 03:17:55,569
Just ban links.

1228
03:17:55,569 --> 03:17:56,569
They are officially banned.

1229
03:17:56,569 --> 03:18:00,129
All right, let me get this again.

1230
03:18:00,129 --> 03:18:10,799
I don't even hit that that way.

1231
03:18:10,799 --> 03:18:11,799
I hit it backwards.

1232
03:18:11,799 --> 03:18:23,200
How do I hit the ball behind me?

1233
03:18:23,440 --> 03:18:24,440
I'm sitting.

1234
03:18:24,440 --> 03:18:25,440
I'm standing sideways.

1235
03:18:25,440 --> 03:18:26,440
I'm hitting.

1236
03:18:26,440 --> 03:18:27,440
How am I hitting it?

1237
03:18:27,440 --> 03:18:28,440
It doesn't make any sense.

1238
03:18:28,440 --> 03:18:29,799
Oh, he's a real pull hitter.

1239
03:18:29,799 --> 03:18:37,059
It's hard.

1240
03:18:37,059 --> 03:18:38,059
The analog is kind of annoying to hold.

1241
03:18:38,059 --> 03:18:41,729
Don't worry.

1242
03:18:41,729 --> 03:18:42,729
Oh, I can't do it in a video game.

1243
03:18:42,729 --> 03:18:43,729
He can't hit the ball in a video game.

1244
03:18:43,729 --> 03:18:44,729
See me in real life.

1245
03:18:44,729 --> 03:19:09,590
See me in real life when I fucking got a real bat in my hand and I will do, I can do it.

1246
03:19:09,590 --> 03:19:10,590
I just watch.

1247
03:19:10,590 --> 03:19:11,590
I'll prove it.

1248
03:19:11,590 --> 03:19:12,590
I'll do it somewhere.

1249
03:19:12,590 --> 03:19:13,590
I'm going to, I'll do a batting cage to him.

1250
03:19:13,590 --> 03:19:14,590
And you guys are going to be like, holding it.

1251
03:19:14,590 --> 03:19:15,590
I'm going to do it.

1252
03:19:15,590 --> 03:19:16,590
I'm going to do it.

1253
03:19:16,590 --> 03:19:17,590
I'm going to do it.

1254
03:19:17,590 --> 03:19:18,590
I'm going to do it.

1255
03:19:19,069 --> 03:19:20,969
Keep in the cage, Mr.

1256
03:19:20,969 --> 03:19:21,969
And you guys are going to be like, holy shit.

1257
03:19:21,969 --> 03:19:40,079
I take back everything I've ever said about this guy.

1258
03:19:40,079 --> 03:20:00,399
That doesn't happen in real life.

1259
03:20:00,399 --> 03:20:03,000
That doesn't happen in real life.

1260
03:20:03,000 --> 03:20:06,979
Plus, I'm not like standing behind the person actually hitting the ball.

1261
03:20:06,979 --> 03:20:08,079
And It's me hitting the ball.

1262
03:20:08,079 --> 03:20:09,959
Now that wasn't an out.

1263
03:20:09,959 --> 03:20:34,290
That was a ground ball with club kitchen length.

1264
03:20:34,290 --> 03:20:35,129
Am I swinging so early?

1265
03:20:35,129 --> 03:20:38,049
I gotta go to the advanced course.

1266
03:20:38,049 --> 03:20:39,049
That's the problem.

1267
03:20:39,049 --> 03:20:47,959
They're going too slow.

1268
03:20:47,959 --> 03:21:09,440
is that early? I'm about to go buy me. Fuck this game. I'm not done. I'm not done. I'm not done.

1269
03:21:09,440 --> 03:21:20,770
I'm not done. I'm just going to walk up to the cashier. I'm going to pull a wad of hundred dollar

1270
03:21:20,770 --> 03:21:25,729
bills out of my hand and just smash it down on the counter and go, just keep the extra. I don't care.

1271
03:21:25,729 --> 03:21:48,450
Don't let anybody else in here for an hour. Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone. It's so slow.

1272
03:21:48,610 --> 03:22:08,520
Oh, it's gone, gone, gone, gone. Oops.

1273
03:22:33,379 --> 03:22:38,639
The advanced one. I will just hold on. I got to load the bases first.

1274
03:22:41,430 --> 03:22:51,959
We go load the bases up. Fucking stupid thing. A curve ball doesn't go 60 miles per hour. It goes

1275
03:22:51,959 --> 03:23:10,049
like fucking 78. There it is bases loaded. Let's go home run. Let's do it. Fuck you. I didn't see it.

1276
03:23:10,450 --> 03:23:15,409
Why do I? OK, another problem is when you when you're playing baseball, I don't like turn my

1277
03:23:15,409 --> 03:23:32,360
entire body and look at the sky to try to hit a home run. Fuck out of here. Grand slam. I win.

1278
03:23:42,389 --> 03:24:06,079
Double. Let's go home run. No, triple. Oh, go to the casino. I'm doing I like this. I'm having fun

1279
03:24:06,079 --> 03:24:14,870
doing this. I'm doing this first. Do the BDSM side quest. How about you do that? Like in your

1280
03:24:14,870 --> 03:24:29,440
own free time. There it is. All right. Let's load it up. Go for a home run right now. Let's go.

1281
03:24:29,440 --> 03:25:11,250
Fuck it. Oh, what's my record? Oh, shit. You don't have a record. Yes, I do.

1282
03:25:24,079 --> 03:25:46,709
Six points. New record. OK, intermediate. Let's do it. Oh, I see. The thing changes.

1283
03:25:46,709 --> 03:26:00,930
Well, that's dumb. This is going to do it. Back to back jacks.

1284
03:26:19,989 --> 03:26:28,370
Again, get back on this one. Oh, fuck. I wouldn't even look at a ball.

1285
03:26:40,479 --> 03:26:57,159
Bullshit. Sorry. We'll do the hard one. Advanced. We're about to pass the the old record.

1286
03:26:57,159 --> 03:27:09,840
Oh, there is a home run up top. This will be interesting. Let's see if I can get it.

1287
03:27:14,280 --> 03:27:27,059
You have to like look in the sky. This is just not even OK. OK, you have like my eyes are

1288
03:27:27,059 --> 03:27:35,860
tracking the home run thing. You can't. I don't have four sets of eyes. I'm looking at the top

1289
03:27:35,860 --> 03:28:00,000
of the screen. I'm not even paying attention with the pitchers doing. One out. What?

1290
03:28:00,000 --> 03:28:17,399
What the fuck are you talking about? I feel like just like the dad that goes in after the kids are

1291
03:28:17,399 --> 03:28:24,420
in there. That was fun, kids. Let me get in there. Dad gets a bat that's way too short for him,

1292
03:28:24,420 --> 03:28:28,450
way too light, like a tee ball bat. He just wants to get in there and just rip.

1293
03:28:29,250 --> 03:28:36,500
He swings as hard as he can, completely off timing and throws his whole back out.

1294
03:28:37,219 --> 03:28:41,379
Hey kids, hey kids, watch this.

1295
03:28:44,100 --> 03:28:56,920
Stop leading the shots. Well, how would I? There's no travel time.

1296
03:29:02,979 --> 03:29:08,180
There's no travel time. It's only hitscan. Oh, well, what the hell? I'm trying to lead the target.

1297
03:29:22,020 --> 03:29:26,579
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back. It's gone. A home run.

1298
03:29:27,299 --> 03:29:39,280
Who's that guy? That guy back, back, back, back. All I want is one. All right. What's another fun

1299
03:29:39,280 --> 03:29:51,159
game I can play here? There's another one. It's 500,000 for the gold rush course. Do I want to play?

1300
03:29:51,879 --> 03:30:20,000
Yeah. Oops. What the hell was that? Yeah, let's go. That came in fast. 100,000. Let's go. Go,

1301
03:30:20,000 --> 03:30:34,389
go, go. That wasn't even a baseball. What the hell was that? That was a boomerang.

1302
03:30:37,139 --> 03:30:51,719
It's a boomerang. All right. The last time I'm going to do this and I'm moving. I'm leaving.

1303
03:30:53,639 --> 03:31:32,120
Come on. Yes. All right. This is the crazy one. Got it. That's 150. Let's go. That's 200.

1304
03:31:41,329 --> 03:31:52,159
That one just like hit me right in the forehead. I just swung a full swing and it hit me right in

1305
03:31:52,159 --> 03:32:06,079
the teeth. Whatever. Fuck this. I'm out. What's this one? Five million for the super gold rush

1306
03:32:06,079 --> 03:32:34,079
course. Let's go. Yeah. That's three. That's it. 500,000. All right. Should I leave one more?

1307
03:32:35,840 --> 03:33:00,100
See right now, the guy, this guy is going to break out of this. He's going to, first of all, he's,

1308
03:33:00,100 --> 03:33:04,739
he's going to run. He's inside of the cage. He's going to run as fast as he can into the door

1309
03:33:04,739 --> 03:33:08,260
and open it the wrong way, right? Because he's going to be like, give me the fuck out of here.

1310
03:33:08,260 --> 03:33:12,260
He's going to open it wrong. You need to pull it, not push it. And he's going to, fuck. Give me

1311
03:33:12,260 --> 03:33:15,620
out. Give me out. Give me out. He's going to open the door and just fucking just run and people in

1312
03:33:15,620 --> 03:33:18,260
his way. He's going to fucking shove people out of the way. Just get out of my, please get out of my

1313
03:33:18,260 --> 03:33:30,920
fucking way. And I'm going to hold both middle fingers up to this guy and then leave. And I'm

1314
03:33:30,920 --> 03:33:38,840
just going to run around screaming, taxi, taxi, taxi, give me a taxi. Like five of them are going

1315
03:33:38,840 --> 03:33:45,319
to taxi. Yes. Where would you like to go? Anywhere within a 50 miles out of here.

1316
03:33:51,479 --> 03:34:11,399
And I'll pay you double. Where am I? What am I? Where should I go next? Disco, disco, disco. Oh,

1317
03:34:11,399 --> 03:34:31,889
there's Mahjong. Disco? Erotic video as well. Okay. I'll play Mahjong. Can I mark it? Oh,

1318
03:34:31,889 --> 03:34:36,450
by the way, everybody, we've officially crossed. I've officially been in the game longer. I told

1319
03:34:36,450 --> 03:34:53,200
you I was going to be in longer. Here I am. By one minute. What's this place? Now the batting

1320
03:34:53,200 --> 03:35:05,459
center. I walk into it. What is that? Where am I? Guess I could hit a few balls. Let me do a mission.

1321
03:35:14,159 --> 03:35:27,299
Where's my hideout? Because I kind of want to go there. It's pink dot as the hideout.

1322
03:35:27,299 --> 03:35:43,969
It's not unlocked. Oh, okay. It's him. Oh, it is me. Let's go. Random encounter.

1323
03:35:44,690 --> 03:36:12,879
Play bingo. Well, maybe in a minute. One, two, three, four, punch. I just kicked him right in

1324
03:36:12,879 --> 03:36:23,459
the face. What's the deal with this guy? You attacked me. How would I have a deal when you're

1325
03:36:23,459 --> 03:36:41,700
the one that confronts me? You're the one with the deal. Am I going to stream the game awards?

1326
03:36:43,200 --> 03:36:56,719
Oh, when are they? Yeah. When are they? That's soon, right? 10th? Yeah, sure. If I can. Definitely.

1327
03:36:58,979 --> 03:37:14,549
You're going to get DMCA'd? Will we? Oh, whatever. All this music comes on. It should be fine.

1328
03:37:24,209 --> 03:37:32,579
Oh, yeah. I got to tell him what happened.

1329
03:37:50,530 --> 03:37:57,120
Tell him you lost six million at the baseball game.

1330
03:38:02,000 --> 03:38:04,719
No, you don't tell people that. You don't lead with that.

1331
03:38:17,000 --> 03:38:22,049
You keep that to yourself.

1332
03:38:22,370 --> 03:38:37,409
I love bingo. It goes like so much fun. It really is. It's so easy. You just have to sit there and

1333
03:38:37,409 --> 03:39:01,639
listen and win sometimes. I should head home. Okay. Walk north through the hotel district.

1334
03:39:10,850 --> 03:39:13,090
When you start liking bingo, that's how you know you're getting old.

1335
03:39:15,399 --> 03:39:30,239
You're old. I mean, I liked it before. I did. What the hell is this? Yeah, you seem to think

1336
03:39:30,239 --> 03:39:41,239
you can just walk by me without a word. This dude is huge. I'm not here to show my god.

1337
03:39:41,959 --> 03:39:51,110
So this is a shakedown. You should pick your targets better. I don't have a single yen for

1338
03:39:51,110 --> 03:40:09,399
chumps like you. Mr. Shakedown? That's this guy's name? What the fuck? Does he just grab you and

1339
03:40:09,399 --> 03:40:32,719
take money from your pocket? Oh shit, I just lost $285,000. What? What just happened? You're not

1340
03:40:32,719 --> 03:40:38,549
half bad. I'll let you off the hook this time. What? If I'm having trouble with somebody like

1341
03:40:38,549 --> 03:40:45,889
you, I need to change my training regimen. Time to bump up the intensity. Should I have shaking

1342
03:40:45,889 --> 03:40:59,139
down to do? I'm just Mr. X. Hey, you okay, man? Hey, you just had the misfortune of meeting

1343
03:40:59,139 --> 03:41:06,049
Hiroya Egashira. Mr. Shakedown, they call him. Mr. Shakedown? Yeah, he'll go after anybody that

1344
03:41:06,049 --> 03:41:10,399
crosses his path, and then he takes everything they have. You seem like you can hold your own

1345
03:41:10,399 --> 03:41:15,809
in a fight, but that guy's on a whole different level. If he sets his sights on you, you run for

1346
03:41:15,809 --> 03:41:24,719
it. He takes all your money? I wish somebody could come along and beat all that stolen money out of

1347
03:41:24,719 --> 03:41:33,760
him. Did he get you? Took my whole holiday bonus. I knew I should have made a beeline to the bank

1348
03:41:33,760 --> 03:41:41,239
with it. Next time you're sitting on a stack of cash. Rumor has it he's not the only Mr. Shakedown

1349
03:41:41,239 --> 03:41:51,239
and that they aren't just a kumarucho thing. Stay sharp. If you ever go out of town. Oh, great.

1350
03:41:51,799 --> 03:42:01,280
If you lose to Mr. Shakedown in battle, he'll take all the money you have. If you can beat Mr.

1351
03:42:01,280 --> 03:42:22,739
Shakedown, you reclaim all the money he steals from you. What? Okay, so how do I deposit money?

1352
03:42:23,299 --> 03:42:42,659
Oh, I got a tissue. Oh, just throw it away. You don't. You there. Wait, is it him? Oh, no, no, no,

1353
03:42:42,739 --> 03:42:56,309
no, no, it's just one guy. This is this is this is not Mr. Shakedown. Spend it on abilities, right?

1354
03:42:56,309 --> 03:43:18,819
Yep. Get out of here. You cannot take what you invest. Fuck, I had I had like $12 million.

1355
03:43:20,180 --> 03:43:28,680
God damn it. All right, hold on. Let me take a break. I'm gonna get some water. I'm gonna go pee.

1356
03:43:28,680 --> 03:47:28,790
I'll be back in like two, three minutes. You're back. Here comes artwork. What do we got?

1357
03:47:30,260 --> 03:48:11,270
Do you have the photos? How are they? Right with a gun? More Jojo? No Catboy. Bad ad game.

1358
03:48:11,270 --> 03:48:32,200
No Catboy this time. All right, let's let's continue. I head back to the game. So I am

1359
03:48:32,200 --> 03:48:35,239
going to tell you guys something that I'm probably only going to stream for like another hour.

1360
03:48:37,190 --> 03:48:48,709
At least it was more than four hours. And then I may I'm trying to kind of gauge those who

1361
03:48:48,709 --> 03:48:57,010
that weren't here. I want to make sure people know this. I've been getting sick. As of this

1362
03:48:57,010 --> 03:49:02,149
kind of past weekend, I started like on like Saturday or so Sunday, I started getting a little

1363
03:49:02,149 --> 03:49:10,549
scratchy. And then I'm kind of stuffy. So I took a bunch of precautions. I took a COVID test.

1364
03:49:11,520 --> 03:49:17,510
And I want to really just kind of make sure that I kind of err on the side of complete caution here.

1365
03:49:17,510 --> 03:49:27,780
So I'm sort of awaiting that. I don't have the I don't know. I don't have the results yet.

1366
03:49:27,780 --> 03:49:37,909
So just want to obviously let everybody know that I'm okay. But yeah, that's pretty much it.

1367
03:49:40,229 --> 03:49:47,409
Hey gamers. So tomorrow, I'll the next like probably three or four plus days are going to

1368
03:49:47,409 --> 03:49:52,610
be sort of erratic. I might stream one day and then two days or one day and then one day, one day off,

1369
03:49:52,610 --> 03:50:03,620
one day on. We'll kind of see how it goes. But I'm okay right now. We'll see. Let's go back to the

1370
03:50:03,620 --> 03:50:26,799
game. That was cute. Ratatouille. Adorable. There's no camera. Fuck. Okay, good. The light is on like

1371
03:50:26,799 --> 03:50:39,750
it's being recorded. Breaks me out for a second. So what can I do with this stuff? Just drink the

1372
03:50:39,750 --> 03:50:56,229
milk? That's all it does? Just eat it. Just eat everything. All right, let's go. What was something

1373
03:50:56,229 --> 03:51:04,180
else I could do? I'm going to let me do the quest and let me spend this money. So I don't hold on.

1374
03:51:04,180 --> 03:51:18,280
Yeah. Before I lose it all gambling. Regular attacks and heat actions. Yes. 30 million,

1375
03:51:20,879 --> 03:51:30,680
2 million. A mighty knee from low stance. More health. Oh wait. Reduce the amount of heat loss

1376
03:51:30,680 --> 03:51:37,920
when you take damage. That's pretty good. And reduces the heat dropping over time. Probably

1377
03:51:37,920 --> 03:51:44,180
this one. Should I do more health? I'm doing this one. So you don't lose a lot of heat when you take

1378
03:51:44,180 --> 03:51:57,809
damage. I like it. I like it. Anything else for like 400? Okay. Increase the power of your regular

1379
03:51:57,809 --> 03:52:12,899
attacks. Go to the disco. All right. I will go to the disco right now and then I'm going to do the

1380
03:52:12,899 --> 03:52:17,170
mission or vice versa. All right. I'm going to do the mission and then I'm going to do the disco.

1381
03:52:17,170 --> 03:52:45,729
I'm going to change my clothes. Karaoke. Karaoke. Karaoke. Maybe soon. Maybe. Look at my eye.

1382
03:52:48,709 --> 03:53:09,319
I can change clothes in here, right? I can put the clown outfit on. Hold on. Get out of my eye.

1383
03:53:15,969 --> 03:53:19,459
Oh damn it. I'm going to laugh every time I see it.

1384
03:53:27,540 --> 03:53:29,520
Hey grab me a couple cigarettes out of the fridge.

1385
03:53:29,760 --> 03:53:37,170
That's both for you. What about me? What the fuck?

1386
03:53:51,620 --> 03:53:58,069
Oh beer.

1387
03:53:58,469 --> 03:54:11,239
Weirdly cluttered. The table is, you got a lot of real estate. Not using a whole lot of it.

1388
03:54:27,760 --> 03:54:34,879
Thank you so much for not being obnoxious and talking through all the cutscenes.

1389
03:54:35,840 --> 03:54:39,040
Thank you so much for not being obnoxious and talking through all the cutscenes like you did

1390
03:54:39,040 --> 03:54:50,790
last time. Did I? I think I'm doing that. I'm doing that right now. Fuck. All right. I'll be quiet.

1391
03:54:51,110 --> 03:54:58,530
Be quiet.

1392
03:55:17,590 --> 03:55:27,829
You can talk? Did this guy not eat? Why are there... What are those bottles over there?

1393
03:55:28,389 --> 03:55:29,829
There's like four bottles on the table.

1394
03:55:29,829 --> 03:55:35,540
I want to that one's gonna eat

1395
03:55:45,020 --> 03:55:48,350
I'll turn it up

1396
03:55:49,549 --> 03:55:54,719
There's ramen on the table. Yeah, we're playing poker with Oreos. He's lost every single round

1397
03:55:55,239 --> 03:56:01,670
We're not old enough to play with money. So we use chips Oreos sticks and food pieces

1398
03:56:15,729 --> 03:56:18,600
Oh

1399
03:56:29,090 --> 03:56:31,090
There are beers on the table

1400
03:56:53,969 --> 03:56:55,969
They're unopened right

1401
03:56:57,469 --> 03:56:59,469
I

1402
03:57:09,959 --> 03:57:14,000
Have those same wrinkles on my eyebrows exact same ones

1403
03:57:29,139 --> 03:57:31,700
Just look at any picture of my face. I'm straight on

1404
03:57:34,819 --> 03:57:39,040
So no

1405
03:57:42,159 --> 03:57:48,379
Face cam no, I'm like sick. I'm not gonna put the face. I'm like like pale and dirty and

1406
03:57:49,200 --> 03:57:51,200
Like dirty. No, I'm too dirty

1407
03:58:05,450 --> 03:58:07,969
Dirty is good. No, it's not

1408
03:58:11,719 --> 03:58:14,020
Me

1409
03:58:14,979 --> 03:58:17,500
Clean and prepared

1410
03:58:28,520 --> 03:58:36,030
Prepared for what I don't know for the day for the world for you for me for everything

1411
03:58:36,670 --> 03:58:44,520
Okay. Here's here's our tweet for what just happened

1412
03:58:45,799 --> 03:58:50,399
Maybe Nishiki's right and I should accept Tachibana's offer

1413
03:58:50,639 --> 03:58:56,799
But I need to I need more to go on before I can trust him. Here we go. There's our lore tweet. I

1414
03:58:57,620 --> 03:59:09,700
Should hit the town to see what I can find out about him. Who's laughing. Oh, that's a crow. I just hear like

1415
03:59:12,059 --> 03:59:40,010
All right, I'm so I'm just gonna pick that herb up on the ground and use it for help final fantasy laugh

1416
03:59:47,360 --> 03:59:55,920
What's the guy that laughs really loudly and um

1417
03:59:57,120 --> 04:00:02,959
What's his name? No, not not Tobin Bell. That's the actor from saw. What's his name?

1418
04:00:06,610 --> 04:00:08,610
Titus right

1419
04:00:11,520 --> 04:00:13,680
Two three four five

1420
04:00:15,299 --> 04:00:18,100
Six seven eight nine ten

1421
04:00:27,440 --> 04:00:29,440
Gaslight him let's cash light him

1422
04:00:34,520 --> 04:00:40,600
We have a disco club disco club disco disco disco disco disco disco

1423
04:00:41,479 --> 04:00:46,239
I'm ready for the disco. Let's do it. I'm going to the middle of the day

1424
04:00:48,950 --> 04:00:50,950
Is it up top? Where is it?

1425
04:00:58,340 --> 04:01:01,459
You thought Christopher Walken and Tobin Bell were the same person

1426
04:01:06,739 --> 04:01:07,780
I mean

1427
04:01:07,780 --> 04:01:09,860
I don't I guess I can kind of

1428
04:01:11,270 --> 04:01:13,270
Sort of see that

1429
04:01:14,129 --> 04:01:16,370
But not in their voice. I mean

1430
04:01:17,170 --> 04:01:20,100
I don't know

1431
04:01:20,100 --> 04:01:24,879
Here you go. I've got I got a million dollars. I'm a millionaire

1432
04:01:25,600 --> 04:01:27,600
I can go in here whenever I want

1433
04:01:27,680 --> 04:01:30,649
Enjoy your time at the maharaja

1434
04:01:36,020 --> 04:01:41,860
Although saw would have probably been a lot more interesting. I guess with Christopher Walken as saw would have been weird

1435
04:01:44,639 --> 04:01:52,659
What can I do?

1436
04:01:52,659 --> 04:01:57,540
These dance moves

1437
04:01:57,540 --> 04:01:59,540
This is like i'm playing in a puddle

1438
04:01:59,860 --> 04:02:08,290
Okay, let's go

1439
04:02:08,290 --> 04:02:11,010
I request talk to people 50 times

1440
04:02:12,899 --> 04:02:14,899
Yeah, let's about the disco

1441
04:02:16,450 --> 04:02:18,850
To dance at the disco press buttons and rhythm with a song

1442
04:02:19,569 --> 04:02:23,969
Use up down left right left right up down b a start to move your character's avatar to the square

1443
04:02:24,530 --> 04:02:26,290
With the next input icon

1444
04:02:26,290 --> 04:02:28,370
And then press the corresponding button when it's there

1445
04:02:29,090 --> 04:02:32,799
As you move your avatar, you'll see the number of steps it takes. Okay

1446
04:02:33,520 --> 04:02:36,340
The more steps you take the more points you will get

1447
04:02:36,819 --> 04:02:40,819
The correct input try to take as many steps as you can on your way to the next input

1448
04:02:41,459 --> 04:02:48,690
You can't squares marked already stepped on won't be counted again

1449
04:02:49,409 --> 04:02:54,760
In the upper middle of the screen is the fever gauge press the left trigger when it's full to trigger dancing fever

1450
04:02:56,100 --> 04:03:00,100
New screen with a series of button input will appear press them with the correct timing to boost your score

1451
04:03:00,899 --> 04:03:03,360
okay

1452
04:03:03,360 --> 04:03:07,040
The voltage gauge at the upper right shows how impressed the audience is with your dancing

1453
04:03:08,549 --> 04:03:11,590
It directly affects what rating you get so build up your score to fill the gauge

1454
04:03:12,389 --> 04:03:15,989
Get just four levels each level earns you another star towards your final dance rating

1455
04:03:17,350 --> 04:03:19,909
I don't know why i'm laughing. It's just funny

1456
04:03:19,909 --> 04:03:23,510
There is also a versus mode in which you can compete with another dancer the one with the higher score wins

1457
04:03:26,530 --> 04:03:30,690
I guess i'll try

1458
04:03:30,690 --> 04:03:33,219
What song do you want?

1459
04:03:33,219 --> 04:03:35,639
Friday night

1460
04:03:35,639 --> 04:03:39,799
queen of passion

1461
04:03:39,799 --> 04:03:44,850
I'm gonna make her mine

1462
04:03:44,850 --> 04:03:48,500
I want to take you home

1463
04:03:48,500 --> 04:03:51,700

04:04:16,760 --> 04:04:24,309
I don't even have to do anything

1468
04:04:24,309 --> 04:04:25,670
Now he's supposed to go

1469
04:04:25,670 --> 04:04:30,440
All right, I have to make steps and then

1470
04:04:32,950 --> 04:04:40,719
I

1471
04:04:40,719 --> 04:04:41,920
I don't understand

1472
04:04:55,590 --> 04:04:57,590
What is I don't understand this is not dancing

1473
04:04:58,309 --> 04:05:05,799
What the fuck is this?

1474
04:05:05,879 --> 04:05:07,879
What kind of dancing mini game is this?

1475
04:05:22,920 --> 04:05:43,250
That's not even dancing

1476
04:05:44,129 --> 04:05:45,879
I just got booed off the stage. Well, sorry

1477
04:05:45,879 --> 04:05:49,079
I have to move the little guy around the screen and press a at the right time

1478
04:05:49,399 --> 04:05:55,540
I thought I was going to be moving around the kid like the guy and dancing

1479
04:06:12,229 --> 04:06:16,610
You don't know shit about dancing. Oh really i'm gonna link them to gif

1480
04:06:17,329 --> 04:06:28,280
Ha ha ha

1481
04:06:28,360 --> 04:06:32,959
All right, here we go. I gotta fill as many squares as I can

1482
04:06:55,600 --> 04:07:19,600
This I don't like this

1483
04:07:27,600 --> 04:07:38,100
Oh, it's too hard to move around that fast

1484
04:07:50,360 --> 04:07:54,360
So i'm not even me dancing with me mashing my buttons until I can get to the right spot and press a

1485
04:07:54,760 --> 04:08:09,920
Fill as many squares and press a on q

1486
04:08:10,719 --> 04:08:17,040

I'm never playing this again

1493
04:09:38,559 --> 04:09:40,719
This is the last time you're ever gonna see disco. I'm never doing it again

1494
04:10:09,360 --> 04:10:22,319
Cool, that's all right. I at least I can go to the next level in the ipad game. I don't care dancing mini game

Wait, wait, hold on

What do you want from me see this dance floor? It's my playground

1506
04:11:08,579 --> 04:11:10,579
And i've been watching you dance friend

1507
04:11:10,979 --> 04:11:14,739
That's when it hit me. You've got a talent for dancing. That's off the scale

1508
04:11:16,819 --> 04:11:19,010
What?

1509
04:11:19,010 --> 04:11:25,620
Yeah, there's no fooling me, but I wouldn't mind seeing it up again up close. I challenge you to a battle

1510
04:11:26,260 --> 04:11:29,639
But you want to fight me? No a dance battle

1511
04:11:30,280 --> 04:11:34,370
All right. I'm doing it. I'm gonna do it one more time

1512
04:11:36,739 --> 04:11:48,399
We're gonna dance battle this guy. How can you not know about dance battles?

1513
04:11:49,809 --> 04:11:53,329
unbelievable

1514
04:11:54,739 --> 04:11:58,600
You're a neanderthal

1515
04:11:58,600 --> 04:12:00,600
I think this twit wants to fight me

1516
04:12:01,399 --> 04:12:02,360
Okay

1517
04:12:02,360 --> 04:12:08,149
Two dancers dancing the same song to see who's better

1518
04:12:15,239 --> 04:12:19,239
Both dancers show this stuff the audience reaction determines the winner. All right, I get the picture great

1519
04:12:19,879 --> 04:12:21,879
You catch on quick for a caveman

1520
04:12:22,040 --> 04:12:24,280
Let's not waste any time then let's hit the floor

1521
04:12:25,319 --> 04:12:27,909
You're looking for a drink in your face. What's this? Why are you doing this?

1522
04:12:30,690 --> 04:12:33,090
Dancing's awesome because you can get down and boogie anytime

1523

And as you all know the xbox controller is wonderful because like when you press one button like up on the xbox controller

1533
04:14:13,909 --> 04:14:16,790
It's every fucking button on your entire controller and your keyboard

And it's every it clicks your mouse buttons, too. I still win get push this guy off the stage

sugar boobs

1690
04:27:51,829 --> 04:27:55,829
Except the part about hearing you out since you'll be too dead now make you move

1691
04:27:58,260 --> 04:28:01,139
Uh holding a weapon on that woman that's going too far

1692
04:28:02,120 --> 04:28:05,559
Uh, you should stop this. Yeah, I should and i'm gonna

1693
04:28:07,639 --> 04:28:09,639

1696
04:28:44,100 --> 04:28:46,600
That's rad

1697
04:28:59,000 --> 04:29:00,040
Why

1698
04:29:00,040 --> 04:29:08,479
I was kind of fucked up that you did that to that 11 year old spike

1699
04:29:09,040 --> 04:29:12,370
Is the girl just crying on the sidewalk right now?

1700
04:29:13,170 --> 04:29:17,649
Mr. Why those moves?

1701
04:29:19,059 --> 04:29:21,059
Looks like that beatdown gave you a few ideas

1702
04:29:23,250 --> 04:29:25,250
Yeah more than a few. Sorry. Yeah

1703
04:29:25,950 --> 04:29:28,530
Fantastic boy. Hope you're ready to put him into practice

1704
04:29:29,780 --> 04:29:30,739
Huh?

1705
04:29:30,739 --> 04:29:46,979
Look over yonder looks like our bad guy here. He's got some friends. Oh shit

1706
04:29:47,540 --> 04:29:50,659
Jin kun's getting beat to hell. He paid the tab last night

1707
04:29:50,899 --> 04:29:54,260
So what say we pay him back by sucker punching this crazy bitch for him?

1708
04:29:55,059 --> 04:30:00,020
You hear that boy those dim bulbs are planning on getting the drop on a little lady from behind

1709
04:30:01,379 --> 04:30:03,879
Sounds that way

1710
04:30:03,879 --> 04:30:08,040
Lovely crowd. They're a perfect match for the sort of scum that'll pull a knife on a woman

1711
04:30:08,680 --> 04:30:12,079
Why don't you give me a little demo of what a man's supposed to be?

1712
04:30:12,799 --> 04:30:17,250
And no saying this doesn't involve you this time. Yeah

1713
04:30:18,149 --> 04:30:24,239
Yeah, I wouldn't she can clearly defend herself there's a whole pack of them i'm jumping in

1714
04:30:25,750 --> 04:30:30,549
Yes, that's my boy keeping chivalry alive and working in a fine bit of training in the process

1715
04:30:32,629 --> 04:30:36,020
The hell do you want?

1716
04:30:36,020 --> 04:30:37,059
Good

1717
04:30:37,059 --> 04:30:41,590
I guess planning a sucker punch that woman in the back. You got an eavesdropping problem

1718
04:30:42,229 --> 04:30:52,069
Damn straight. We are is it a robot? It shouldn't be what the robot? That should not be a robot. Why is it a robot?

1719
04:30:53,520 --> 04:31:00,100
What it doesn't know hold on a second what that's not what it's supposed to be sounding like let me see

1720
04:31:00,579 --> 04:31:05,729
No, what the fuck that's not supposed to sound like that. It's supposed to sound why is it? Why is it? Okay?

1721
04:31:05,729 --> 04:31:09,569
There we go. What the fuck it was supposed to be like that. Okay

1722
04:31:16,420 --> 04:31:18,579
You think I want that psycho bitch to see me coming

1723
04:31:19,139 --> 04:31:21,299
We'll drop her before she can get those claws out

1724
04:31:21,780 --> 04:31:26,739
I don't care how tough she is. You don't hit a woman and needing a group to do it. It's just pathetic

1725
04:31:27,379 --> 04:31:29,379
You call yourselves men

1726
04:31:29,379 --> 04:31:33,620
What the fuck did you say you got a big mouth and a death wish bell yo

1727
04:31:34,260 --> 04:31:36,500
We're dropping this guy before we take care of the broad

1728
04:31:39,030 --> 04:31:40,469
Oh, is that so?

1729
04:31:40,469 --> 04:31:47,110
Switch to beast style

1730
04:31:47,110 --> 04:31:51,590
You can switch to be style by pressing right by changing to be style now. Okay, let's try it

1731
04:31:52,549 --> 04:31:57,989
Press x while near a large weapon showing a mark to automatically pick it up and swing it. This is called an auto weapon attack

1732
04:31:58,870 --> 04:32:00,870
Bash an enemy with an auto weapon attack. Okay

1733
04:32:16,579 --> 04:32:19,079
Yeah

1734
04:32:19,079 --> 04:32:23,430
Where is it a huge weapon? Where is it?

1735
04:32:26,520 --> 04:32:35,040
Oh use x get out of here use x. Oh, that's not a beast weapon

1736
04:32:51,219 --> 04:32:54,930
All right, is there anything else bigger

1737
04:32:57,200 --> 04:32:59,200
withstand the enemy attacks

1738
04:33:00,370 --> 04:33:03,329
Holding lp to guard lets you withstand enemy attacks with the resist guard

1739
04:33:03,809 --> 04:33:07,490
You'll take a certain amount of damage, but you are protected against attacks from any direction. That's cool

1740
04:33:08,529 --> 04:33:14,599
Okay

1741
04:33:14,599 --> 04:33:17,000
Use beast style moves to pulverize the back

1742
04:33:17,889 --> 04:33:20,580
Pack of power

1743
04:33:20,659 --> 04:33:22,659
Dodge roll now, that's cool

1744
04:33:39,909 --> 04:33:42,979
Nice drop kick

1745
04:33:43,459 --> 04:33:45,299
I'm so fucking mad

1746
04:33:45,299 --> 04:33:51,139
And pick him up by their legs. Oh, that's so awesome

1747
04:34:01,200 --> 04:34:07,810
What is this guy all of us beating on him and it's like he doesn't even feel it you want more

1748
04:34:09,729 --> 04:34:12,529
No, i'm leaving i'm not leaving till at least I punch that bitch

1749
04:34:13,330 --> 04:34:14,290
All right

1750
04:34:14,290 --> 04:34:18,000
Well, i've hold on

1751
04:34:18,880 --> 04:34:20,319
Well, if it isn't

1752
04:34:20,319 --> 04:34:23,279
Porky's little friends. I saw you boys crawling the bar last night

1753
04:34:24,659 --> 04:34:29,270
Uh, I must be hearing things because it sounded like you said something about punching

1754
04:34:29,990 --> 04:34:32,630
Me out if you're interested. This bitch is ready to go

1755
04:34:34,069 --> 04:34:37,590
No, no, no me. I'm just that's just crazy. What kind of man would do that?

1756
04:34:38,549 --> 04:34:40,549
And with a group that's pathetic

1757
04:34:43,119 --> 04:34:46,560
Right now pick up that sad sack line over there and get the hell out of my sight

1758
04:34:48,450 --> 04:34:50,849
I got what I came here for got no use for him now

1759
04:34:52,680 --> 04:34:57,569
Yes, ma'am

1760
04:34:57,569 --> 04:34:59,569
Mr. Satan. No, it's not

1761
04:35:00,880 --> 04:35:10,340
Nothing. Everything that is low is not. Mr. Satan. Is it? It's not everything. It's not. Mr. Satan

1762
04:35:11,060 --> 04:35:13,060
This is not. Mr. Satan

1763
04:35:14,279 --> 04:35:16,599
This is this is uh, you know, yeah

1764
04:35:17,319 --> 04:35:21,000
It's like a hidden camera tv show where they got the person completely blacked out with a silhouette

1765
04:35:21,889 --> 04:35:27,250
Yeah, when I uh, you know that the crazy part is when I watched him when we're working at mcdonald's

1766
04:35:28,130 --> 04:35:31,270
Yeah, he uh, no, it's even lower. It's like yeah

1767
04:35:33,560 --> 04:35:36,880
My identity needs to be taken care of because I watched him

1768
04:35:36,880 --> 04:35:42,209
I watched him pee into the coffee machine and it was disgusting and we tried to make him stop

1769
04:35:42,209 --> 04:35:50,200
We tried to get rid of him. It's a boss was just crazy. He was just fucking fucked up

1770
04:35:52,439 --> 04:35:53,880
Arthur

1771
04:35:53,880 --> 04:36:01,430
I want you to know something Arthur. I do believe it me. I don't know what you're saying

1772
04:36:02,770 --> 04:36:05,569
I'm not doing this again. No, we're not doing this again. I'd rather do this

1773
04:36:06,919 --> 04:36:10,040
What is this bit there is no bit you've already seen it before

1774
04:36:12,020 --> 04:36:16,740
It returns it returns. It's time to go back into this bit

1775
04:36:17,220 --> 04:36:32,369
If you remember this one from a few months ago go. How do I get back to the game? I need a new trailer

1776
04:36:37,060 --> 04:36:40,080
Yeah

1777
04:36:40,080 --> 04:36:44,479
It's groundhog day. No, i'm not that we don't repeat material here

1778
04:36:45,590 --> 04:36:48,549
Except almost every day we do but you know, whatever

1779
04:36:49,189 --> 04:36:54,979
Hmm

1780
04:36:54,979 --> 04:36:57,599
Names kiru

1781
04:36:57,599 --> 04:36:59,139
Kiru, huh?

1782
04:36:59,139 --> 04:37:01,139
I'll remember the name if you've got

1783
04:37:01,380 --> 04:37:04,340
Bacchus singing your praises. You've got to be pretty tough. Yes

1784
04:37:05,509 --> 04:37:09,029
Yes, this boy is a future champion. Let's take my career on it

1785
04:37:10,049 --> 04:37:15,009
Oh, okay. Now i'm seeing what this is you're thinking kiru here is your ticket to a fat stack of cash

1786
04:37:15,490 --> 04:37:17,970
Which then you'll use to pay me back so we can get to stay friends

1787
04:37:19,270 --> 04:37:20,709
Easy tiger

1788
04:37:20,709 --> 04:37:24,310
I told you it'll take a while, but you'll get it back. Oh speaking of favors

1789
04:37:25,029 --> 04:37:27,029
Why don't you train the boy here?

1790
04:37:29,189 --> 04:37:32,709
Wait, well, this is like a table read for a tv show. I'm not even getting into this

1791
04:37:35,430 --> 04:37:37,909
The actor is not even doing the voice. They're doing like the halfway

1792
04:37:39,959 --> 04:37:41,959
Table read youtube video

1793
04:37:44,450 --> 04:37:47,650
Do I seem like the patient teacher and then they all they all laugh too

1794
04:37:48,369 --> 04:37:50,930
After like funny lines, even though they're saying i'm like on a halfway

1795
04:37:52,310 --> 04:37:53,619
Now

1796
04:37:53,619 --> 04:37:56,819
Ah, don't be like that. We both need him to get stronger

1797
04:37:58,740 --> 04:38:01,459
Everyone starts laughing and we're like they all have glasses on too

1798
04:38:02,020 --> 04:38:04,020
Every single person at the table has glasses on

1799
04:38:04,500 --> 04:38:08,790
We'll be rolling in dough besides. I know you're secretly the doting type

1800
04:38:09,590 --> 04:38:16,069
He'll make a champion a hell of a lot faster with you beating him into shape. That means you get paid sooner. Hmm

1801
04:38:16,229 --> 04:38:18,880
See win-win

1802
04:38:18,880 --> 04:38:23,880
What focus?

1803
04:38:23,880 --> 04:38:25,880
What do you think you're doing here, man? Yeah

1804
04:38:27,250 --> 04:38:29,830
Negotiating an apprenticeship with miss tatsu for you

1805
04:38:35,680 --> 04:38:37,680
Sorry, sorry

1806
04:38:37,919 --> 04:38:43,729
Obviously, trust me you train under her. You'll be master of the ring in no time flat

1807
04:38:44,689 --> 04:38:51,409
Uh, you're insane. I'm in seriously in hot water right now. I don't have the time to humor your little fantasies

1808
04:38:52,689 --> 04:38:53,729
What?

1809
04:38:53,729 --> 04:38:55,729
You're at hot water too. My boy

1810
04:38:56,689 --> 04:38:58,770
This is great. This is great

1811
04:38:59,889 --> 04:39:02,770
Are we talking knife in the ribs here? Because I warned you about that

1812
04:39:03,650 --> 04:39:08,720
I'll be lucky if that's all I get and seriously, what's this obsession with me getting stabbed about?

1813
04:39:10,979 --> 04:39:15,220
All right chuckle heads. That's enough. Neither of one of you is making a damn bit of sense

1814
04:39:17,240 --> 04:39:24,200
Here you walks from stage left into the scene and get swarmed by 25 enemies. Oh shit

1815
04:39:27,080 --> 04:39:33,240
But I hear where you're coming from focus ditch the championship talk and just say you care about this kiro kid

1816
04:39:34,040 --> 04:39:36,659
If you're worried about him own it

1817
04:39:41,040 --> 04:39:43,840
Look, you did me a solid minute ago. What was what's on the floor over there?

1818
04:39:45,090 --> 04:39:47,270
Oh, this is trash

1819
04:39:47,349 --> 04:39:50,069
The old man is right that my training will make a real man out of you

1820
04:39:52,450 --> 04:39:55,330
Hop a cab out to the pier sometime. I'll give you a training space there

1821
04:39:56,610 --> 04:39:58,369
You train at the pier

1822
04:39:58,369 --> 04:40:01,490
You got it kind of live that i'm holding this paper still

1823
04:40:02,209 --> 04:40:05,330
Put down pay me a visit sometime see for yourself. I think you'll get the digs

1824
04:40:06,209 --> 04:40:11,599
Everyone looks over at me. What the what do yeah, i've memorized the lines already. I don't need the fucking paper anymore

1825
04:40:12,319 --> 04:40:15,680
All you guys that show up like three days before we hurt rehearsal. No, fuck all of you

1826
04:40:25,700 --> 04:40:30,819
Focus i've already got a future plan. I'm sorry, but I can't be your champion. What sport are we even talking about boxing?

1827
04:40:31,540 --> 04:40:33,459
Not that it matters. I can't

1828
04:40:33,459 --> 04:40:36,599
It's a toxic theater kid

1829
04:40:43,119 --> 04:40:45,360
I know that doesn't mean i'll stop trying

1830
04:40:46,000 --> 04:40:50,580
But I know i'll just stop making a nuisance of myself. I'll give you some spice jump

1831
04:40:51,060 --> 04:40:54,500
It's about time for my afternoon drink. Anyway, help me clear my head

1832
04:40:56,049 --> 04:40:58,049
Good luck with that. Just don't have too many

1833
04:40:59,009 --> 04:41:02,130
Do you think a guy called bakas can't hold his wine?

1834
04:41:02,610 --> 04:41:06,819
Ha see you around boy and keep those ribs knife free

1835
04:41:07,779 --> 04:41:10,880
Get out of here. Thanks. I'll be careful

1836
04:41:14,720 --> 04:41:18,310
I will thank you for hanging out with me

1837
04:41:19,029 --> 04:41:25,250
This afternoon didn't expect to get wrapped up in that mess, but at least I didn't come away empty-handed

1838
04:41:33,319 --> 04:41:35,319
That is torn on who that is

1839
04:41:37,509 --> 04:41:45,189
British bernie sanders. I mean like boris johnson kind of is like sounds like that british bernie

1840
04:41:57,000 --> 04:42:00,549
What's going on this is a rough looking crowd

1841
04:42:01,349 --> 04:42:07,520
What do I ever do for this guy?

1842
04:42:07,520 --> 04:42:09,750
uh

1843
04:42:09,750 --> 04:42:11,110
Oi, um

1844
04:42:11,110 --> 04:42:12,470
Oi. Oi

1845
04:42:12,470 --> 04:42:14,470
I'm so freaking stoked man

1846
04:42:15,509 --> 04:42:18,630
Oh rare street show, but you're gonna meet your silvers

1847
04:42:20,069 --> 04:42:22,950
Too right those guys are rock and roll boards

1848
04:42:23,750 --> 04:42:25,750
Look at this bitching crowd

1849
04:42:25,830 --> 04:42:30,229
They drew all these punks without any ads or any nothing at all

1850
04:42:31,029 --> 04:42:33,029
crazy, it's crazy

1851
04:42:33,189 --> 04:42:41,619
I think this looks like a street documentary voice. It's not documentary voice

1852
04:42:44,689 --> 04:42:46,689
They're all boris johnson

1853
04:42:47,330 --> 04:42:53,159
It's not nigel thornberry. What?

1854
04:42:56,209 --> 04:42:59,409
How do you get boris johnson and nigel thornberry mixed up?

1855
04:43:03,380 --> 04:43:07,779
Keep your pants on but I heard the yokomichi silvers are heading for a q and a panel

1856
04:43:09,200 --> 04:43:13,360
No effing way. They're famous for never saying a word and letting their music do the talking

1857
04:43:13,919 --> 04:43:15,919
I wonder what the hell they're talking about

1858
04:43:16,400 --> 04:43:24,340
Sounds like some band's doing an event here

1859
04:43:24,759 --> 04:43:26,759
Must be popular with the local punks

1860
04:43:27,409 --> 04:43:33,560
hmm

1861
04:43:33,560 --> 04:43:35,799
Oops, wait, can you it's coming through twice?

1862
04:43:36,759 --> 04:43:41,250
It might no no

1863
04:43:41,250 --> 04:43:43,009
theater square

1864
04:43:43,009 --> 04:43:44,209
All right, so

1865
04:43:44,209 --> 04:43:45,409
Save the game

1866
04:43:45,409 --> 04:43:49,000
Oh, there's a quest marker over here quest quest quest

1867
04:43:51,270 --> 04:43:53,270
Uh, you didn't see me do that

1868
04:43:54,560 --> 04:43:58,400
Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Look at these people. Holy cow. What are we going to do?

1869
04:43:59,919 --> 04:44:01,919
Oi, hey you

1870
04:44:02,080 --> 04:44:03,840
Yikes

1871
04:44:04,080 --> 04:44:09,599
Gee whiz pal. I never peed. I didn't peepee my pants. What are you doing chuffing around behind me? You ugly knob

1872
04:44:11,080 --> 04:44:13,080
Oh, yeah, sorry

1873
04:44:13,159 --> 04:44:16,680
All right, but I should apologize for bumping into you earlier

1874
04:44:18,450 --> 04:44:19,889
oh

1875
04:44:19,889 --> 04:44:30,259
You're that man

1876
04:44:30,259 --> 04:44:33,380
I love so much. Oh everybody fucking hates this

1877
04:44:35,110 --> 04:44:37,110
It's giving me energy right now

1878
04:44:39,860 --> 04:44:46,450
Uh, sure

1879
04:44:46,450 --> 04:44:48,770
Wait a second. Could you possibly be unaware of who I am?

1880
04:44:49,250 --> 04:44:54,919
Yeah, uh, are you asking me if we met before if we bumped into each other if we did I don't recognize you

1881
04:44:58,389 --> 04:45:01,990
Oh, wait a second then so you really don't know who I am. Oh willikers. What a relief

1882
04:45:03,669 --> 04:45:10,229
I'm so sorry. I was rude. Don't not too true. My name's kyo. My stage name is crazy kyo. I'm the vocalist in a band

1883
04:45:11,029 --> 04:45:16,209
Let me guess the yoke meet you silvers

1884
04:45:19,159 --> 04:45:22,680
Same band these young punks are excited to see aren't you guys some kind of legendary?

1885
04:45:23,240 --> 04:45:24,840
yankee band

1886
04:45:24,840 --> 04:45:29,319
I'm gonna chat just gave you a hundred dollars to fuck off

1887
04:45:30,639 --> 04:45:33,459
What I don't read bits anymore

1888
04:45:33,700 --> 04:45:40,069
He's a jerk. The lemmy gave a hundred bucks jerma. I will pay you to never do this voice ever again

1889
04:45:40,150 --> 04:45:42,150
Well, you did it before I agreed to that

1890
04:45:43,779 --> 04:45:48,419
So now i'm going to read your message in the voice that you didn't want that you paid to stop

1891
04:46:03,720 --> 04:46:09,959
He's a scumbag no, thanks. You can't pay me to do anything. I'll never accept money to do something. I'm never requiring

1892
04:46:15,509 --> 04:46:22,419
90

1893
04:46:22,419 --> 04:46:24,419
Even hardcore in the slightest

1894
04:46:24,419 --> 04:46:27,619
No, as a joke, we tried dressing all punk at a show to our shock

1895
04:46:27,619 --> 04:46:31,860
We got pretty popular with the yankee crowd, but now we have to keep up this charade full time

1896
04:46:32,740 --> 04:46:39,169
Every time we gained a fan base of wannabe punks and the yoke go meet you silvers became heroes to the rebellious youth of japan

1897
04:46:39,409 --> 04:46:41,409
Little style is called yankee now

1898
04:46:42,520 --> 04:46:43,810
Okay

1899
04:46:43,810 --> 04:46:45,810
There's more to running a band than I thought

1900
04:46:46,790 --> 04:46:48,790
So what do you mean by me saving you?

1901
04:46:49,189 --> 04:46:53,959
I um actually now I know this game's 80 hours long. I figured it out

1902
04:46:54,599 --> 04:46:57,459
I see

1903
04:46:57,459 --> 04:46:59,860
I want you to teach me how to be a hardcore hooligan

1904
04:47:02,240 --> 04:47:04,240
Teach you to be a yankee

1905
04:47:04,770 --> 04:47:08,290
Yes, you see for today's event. We also have to do a live panel

1906
04:47:08,930 --> 04:47:10,930
a meet-and-greet for the fans

1907
04:47:11,680 --> 04:47:18,000
Every member of the yokimichi silvers myself included are law-abiding choir boys. We've never even shoplifted

1908
04:47:18,959 --> 04:47:24,819
If we were to talk in front of the real yankee, they'd realize that we're phonies

1909
04:47:25,459 --> 04:47:29,700
Fake punks. Eh now that you mentioned it the way you talk doesn't match how you dress at all

1910
04:47:33,009 --> 04:47:39,090
You are a choir boy, right? So if we spoke to our fans, we'd lose all our credibility and popularity in an instant

1911
04:47:40,290 --> 04:47:42,450
Or worse, what if they want revenge on us for fooling them?

1912
04:47:48,040 --> 04:47:50,360
Okay, but do you have to do this panel thing? Why don't you just skip it?

1913
04:47:51,810 --> 04:47:54,290
I don't want to do it either but our agency says we need to hone

1914
04:47:54,930 --> 04:47:57,810
Our speaking skills. We want to stay popular. They're making us do this

1915
04:47:58,610 --> 04:48:05,880
Are you know when you're in line for the ride at like disney world or universal studios?

1916
04:48:07,060 --> 04:48:09,380
And you're just sitting there in line watching the videos

1917
04:48:11,090 --> 04:48:14,130
It's like an hour and a half watching the videos in line

1918
04:48:15,720 --> 04:48:19,319
And then you get onto the ride and the ride is like three minutes long

1919
04:48:20,279 --> 04:48:24,680
And you're like, holy shit. That was fun. And then you kind of get in line for another ride and you watch the videos again

1920
04:48:25,479 --> 04:48:29,799
I feel like this is this game

1921
04:48:29,799 --> 04:48:33,400
Like i'm in line at the ride and then when we actually fight people

1922
04:48:34,770 --> 04:48:37,650
Like I get to be on fucking back to the future for two minutes

1923
04:48:38,369 --> 04:48:47,590
So you want me to teach you how to behave like a yankee?

1924
04:48:51,560 --> 04:48:53,560
He hates it. No, I don't

1925
04:48:53,639 --> 04:49:01,729
I don't

1926
04:49:01,729 --> 04:49:03,490
I don't hate this

1927
04:49:03,490 --> 04:49:10,799
When did I say I hated the back to the future of ride line experience? I never said that

1928
04:49:11,680 --> 04:49:16,290
I just said that's what it reminds me of

1929
04:49:16,610 --> 04:49:24,689
You implied it. No, I didn't I said this, you know, you know, you know, this reminds me of

1930
04:49:25,490 --> 04:49:29,840
You can teach us. Okay, teach me how to be don't

1931
04:49:37,110 --> 04:49:39,110
He hates back to the future. This is not

1932
04:49:39,509 --> 04:49:42,520
How much do you like lines then?

1933
04:49:45,029 --> 04:49:47,509
in simulator

1934
04:49:47,509 --> 04:49:49,509
You heavily implied it

1935
04:49:50,840 --> 04:49:53,159
Do you love to watch the theme park videos before the ride?

1936
04:49:53,159 --> 04:49:57,560
Yes, I do because it fills me in and I get to see stuff that I've never seen before

1937
04:49:58,279 --> 04:50:00,919
That's content. You don't get to see unless you go to the ride

1938
04:50:01,799 --> 04:50:07,490
Or I mean maybe like on like the special features of the dvd. They might put it on there

1939
04:50:08,130 --> 04:50:16,950
All right, let's do it

1940
04:50:17,189 --> 04:50:27,279
Okie dokie

1941
04:50:27,279 --> 04:50:29,349
Give me a second, please

1942
04:50:29,349 --> 04:50:31,200
Okay

1943
04:50:31,200 --> 04:50:32,159
You're back

1944
04:50:32,159 --> 04:50:33,599
Sorry to keep you waiting

1945
04:50:33,599 --> 04:50:41,250
This is our drummer sleazy tarashi

1946
04:50:45,000 --> 04:50:46,599
Hey, i'm tarashi

1947
04:50:46,599 --> 04:50:50,200
My stage name is sleazy, but I have no experience with the ladies never even seen a boo

1948
04:50:51,330 --> 04:50:53,330
This is our bassist bad boy aku

1949
04:50:53,970 --> 04:50:58,200
I'm aku hobbies caring for elders

1950
04:50:58,680 --> 04:51:00,360
This is kirusan

1951
04:51:00,360 --> 04:51:04,279
Is going to impart the ways of true yankee style hooliganism onto us

1952
04:51:05,240 --> 04:51:06,919
Please teach us

1953
04:51:06,919 --> 04:51:08,200
Okay

1954
04:51:08,200 --> 04:51:12,389
You guys are so polite and proper. I'm starting to wonder if there's anything I can do for you

1955
04:51:13,189 --> 04:51:18,439
Oh, no, please don't say that. We're all pretty good guys at heart. So please help us

1956
04:51:19,319 --> 04:51:22,319
In your case being pretty good at guys is the problem

1957
04:51:23,540 --> 04:51:26,180
I did agree to this. So somehow am I gonna beat this shit out of them?

1958
04:51:27,840 --> 04:51:40,419
How can I show you how to be tougher? Maybe you could come up with an opening remark for a little old me

1959
04:51:41,299 --> 04:51:42,849
Okay

1960
04:51:42,849 --> 04:51:48,150
I want to kick off our panel with authority being hooligans. We shouldn't come across as weak or hesitant

1961
04:51:48,869 --> 04:51:51,330
I need a zinger

1962
04:51:51,330 --> 04:51:55,540
Dearly beloved we're gathered here today start your engines. Hello, but in english

1963
04:51:56,580 --> 04:51:59,779
What opening with hello, but it's in english

1964
04:52:01,029 --> 04:52:03,029
English do you really think so?

1965
04:52:03,799 --> 04:52:06,840
I mean a hooligan speaking english. Is that is that yankee style?

1966
04:52:07,479 --> 04:52:13,569
I think it would be just right for a yankee young rebels fall hard for what's cool and english is the language of rock and roll

1967
04:52:15,779 --> 04:52:16,900
Okay

1968
04:52:16,900 --> 04:52:21,540
Think about it their hero the vocalist of the yokomichi silver speaks a language. They don't know

1969
04:52:22,259 --> 04:52:24,419
They can't help but be impressed by his worldiness

1970
04:52:25,220 --> 04:52:28,479
Do I have to keep speaking english afterwards?

1971
04:52:29,040 --> 04:52:31,520
That's going to be a challenge. I only know a few greetings

1972
04:52:33,409 --> 04:52:36,849
Same goes for them though. If you sound like you know what you're saying you can get away with it

1973
04:52:37,490 --> 04:52:41,250
Do we get to watch this?

1974
04:52:41,250 --> 04:52:45,110
Rock and roll

1975
04:52:45,110 --> 04:52:49,799
What is it? Well the agency told me to tell the fans about how I spend my days off

1976
04:52:50,279 --> 04:52:52,279
When i'm not rehearsing or performing

1977
04:52:53,080 --> 04:52:57,159
Days off, huh? Makes sense that fans would want to know their heroes live from day to day

1978
04:52:58,119 --> 04:52:59,799
How the heroes live?

1979
04:52:59,799 --> 04:53:01,799
Terashi, how would you spend a day off?

1980
04:53:02,919 --> 04:53:06,599
I make a habit of getting up bright and early so I can make some pancakes after breakfast

1981
04:53:06,599 --> 04:53:10,439
I take my darling puppy chibi chan to the park for a mid-morning stroll

1982
04:53:11,400 --> 04:53:13,639
And then we have lunch at

1983
04:53:13,639 --> 04:53:19,159
Chick cafe to rest our feet on our way home. We do little window shopping after that. I binge on the dramas

1984
04:53:20,040 --> 04:53:22,040
I've got this is when I like make my phone

1985
04:53:22,680 --> 04:53:24,680
Do a fucking ringtone

1986
04:53:25,000 --> 04:53:28,040
And be like, oh, yeah. Yeah. All right. Okay. I gotta I gotta take this see you later guys

1987
04:53:29,400 --> 04:53:32,080
You just described a typical girl's day

1988
04:53:34,639 --> 04:53:36,319
Oh, sorry

1989
04:53:36,319 --> 04:53:40,240
That really made you sound like a fashionable young woman. I was so surprised. I got intense

1990
04:53:40,720 --> 04:53:44,400
Uh, I'm so scared

1991
04:53:45,599 --> 04:53:51,279
Oh, no, kira-san. You shouldn't shout like that. You made sleazy terashi cry. That's a bit much. Don't you think?

1992
04:53:54,049 --> 04:53:56,049
Oh dear sniffle

1993
04:53:56,689 --> 04:54:01,729
Should say sorry

1994
04:54:01,729 --> 04:54:03,959
Yeah, my bad

1995
04:54:03,959 --> 04:54:07,560
It's it's all right. I was just startled. I wasn't expecting it is all

1996
04:54:08,900 --> 04:54:12,200
Sniffles, so how about I spend a day off? How should I spend it? How should I do it?

1997
04:54:13,639 --> 04:54:15,639
It's kind of sound like butt head right there

1998
04:54:19,779 --> 04:54:22,500
One thing's clear. You can't tell the fans how you really spend your free time

1999
04:54:23,220 --> 04:54:26,479
No, I guess not. But then what should I say?

2000
04:54:27,119 --> 04:54:32,279
What would I be doing instead?

2001
04:54:32,279 --> 04:54:34,279
You'd be you'd be hanging with mates

2002
04:54:35,000 --> 04:54:43,330
And you just have to say you spend it having fun with your friends

2003
04:54:43,970 --> 04:54:48,560
I think all my friends that's kind of ordinary, isn't it? I mean, I already do that pretty regularly

2004
04:54:49,599 --> 04:54:52,720
Think about it punks are people too on their days off

2005
04:54:53,279 --> 04:54:57,040
Even they would want to spend it with their friends ever notice them squatting together in parking lots

2006
04:54:57,520 --> 04:55:03,409
Uh, that's true. I see them loitering around like you say, but are they really friends?

2007
04:55:05,639 --> 04:55:07,639
Oh, I used the wrong word

2008
04:55:07,639 --> 04:55:09,080
Isn't wrong

2009
04:55:09,080 --> 04:55:12,209
They're not friends. It should be mates

2010
04:55:12,880 --> 04:55:15,040
Mates actually when you put what people running

2011
04:55:18,229 --> 04:55:20,950
You see on your days off you hang out with your mates

2012
04:55:23,599 --> 04:55:27,119
Actually you and your mates just shoot the shit with each other say that and you'll be fine

2013
04:55:28,000 --> 04:55:32,959
I kind of get it. I'm not sure what that actually means but hanging out with mates sounds totally what hooligans would do

2014
04:55:35,279 --> 04:55:37,590
Now, what do you want?

2015
04:55:37,590 --> 04:55:40,069
You're a bad boy aku, right? What's the matter?

2016
04:55:40,869 --> 04:55:43,360
What should I say?

2017
04:55:43,360 --> 04:55:45,700
Uh, you didn't get a topic like tarashi

2018
04:55:46,400 --> 04:55:48,049
No

2019
04:55:48,049 --> 04:55:50,369
The agency told him to wing it. He's free to talk about whatever

2020
04:55:51,409 --> 04:55:53,409
Even though he's practically mute

2021
04:55:54,119 --> 04:55:59,639
Bad boy aku even has a backstory locked up in juvenile reformatories from birth bad boy

2022
04:55:59,639 --> 04:56:02,520
Aku crushed packs of punks before he even finished preschool

2023
04:56:03,080 --> 04:56:04,709
Mmm

2024
04:56:04,709 --> 04:56:07,270
Your agency's trying to fit a square peg in a round hole

2025
04:56:07,990 --> 04:56:12,840
Man, a few words the crazy backstory. What should he talk about to make him sound hardcore?

2026
04:56:17,279 --> 04:56:18,400
Nothing at all

2027
04:56:18,400 --> 04:56:24,040
Anything be better if you just stay quiet

2028
04:56:25,360 --> 04:56:29,599
Stay silent during the panel wouldn't a discussion without any talking be a disaster

2029
04:56:31,430 --> 04:56:36,310
Nope aku was told he's free to talk about whatever he wants. That means he's also free not to talk at all

2030
04:56:37,189 --> 04:56:39,700
that's true, but

2031
04:56:39,700 --> 04:56:42,419
It would be worse if he were to say the wrong things and wreck his image

2032
04:56:43,220 --> 04:56:46,659
From aku's backstory, I think he would seem more hardcore if he kept his mouth shut

2033
04:56:48,099 --> 04:56:54,360
Yeah, you put it that way it makes total sense. Okay, we'll do that bad boy aku stay speechless during his part

2034
04:56:57,880 --> 04:57:01,700
I can't get over it sure aku. Are you good with that?

2035
04:57:02,340 --> 04:57:05,270
Okay. All right

2036
04:57:05,270 --> 04:57:07,880
Now we'll go over how you'll run this panel discussion

2037
04:57:10,470 --> 04:57:13,750
Yes, please

2038
04:57:13,750 --> 04:57:15,189
Oh, here we go

2039
04:57:15,189 --> 04:57:26,240
We're almost ready for your panel

2040
04:57:26,240 --> 04:57:28,240
I'll be watching from the audience. Let's see how we do

2041
04:57:29,430 --> 04:57:32,869
Yes, please watch us we're going to hit this hardcore yankee thing out of the park

2042
04:57:33,909 --> 04:57:36,400
We're gonna kick ass and stuff. Mm-hmm

2043
04:57:38,630 --> 04:57:39,830
All right, let's see it

2044
04:57:39,830 --> 04:57:42,930
Yeah, they are put your hands together for the yoko bichi silvers

2045
04:57:49,430 --> 04:57:51,430
Ooh crazy kyo san

2046
04:57:52,150 --> 04:57:58,869
Bad boy aku over here. Oh my god. Check out crazy kyo sans original esp guitar smoking red

2047
04:57:59,509 --> 04:58:01,509
The man's got the yankee look nailed

2048
04:58:03,799 --> 04:58:08,200
Oh, they are popular and they're not talking they do look like real greasers

2049
04:58:10,630 --> 04:58:13,110
Sopping wet high rock and roll after school

2050
04:58:13,669 --> 04:58:15,669
Tarashi aku hit it boys

2051
04:58:24,209 --> 04:58:26,849
That concludes what?

2052
04:58:26,849 --> 04:58:29,250
That concludes today's performance by the yoki bichi silvers

2053
04:58:30,049 --> 04:58:34,450
Just listening to their songs. I can see why yankee kids across japan look up to crazy kyo's band

2054
04:58:35,250 --> 04:58:39,569
We'd like to move on to a special meet and greet panel discussion with the band members

2055
04:58:41,459 --> 04:58:45,299
Whoa, no way

2056
04:58:45,299 --> 04:58:48,180
Crazy kyo sans actually gonna talk to us. That's mental

2057
04:58:49,220 --> 04:58:52,259
I can't fucking wait to hear bad boy aku's voice

2058
04:58:54,080 --> 04:58:56,080
Here's where it gets real. They better pull it off

2059
04:58:57,400 --> 04:58:59,159
Yo, grease hounds

2060
04:58:59,159 --> 04:59:03,270
Hello, everyone rock and roll. We are

2061
04:59:03,970 --> 04:59:05,970
yokio michi silvers

2062
04:59:07,680 --> 04:59:13,759
Holy shit crazy kyo can can even speak english. That's so bitching. I'm gonna totally get up going mental

2063
04:59:14,880 --> 04:59:18,240
My god that totally authentic pronunciation. It drives me wild

2064
04:59:18,880 --> 04:59:20,880
I'm shitting bricks over here

2065
04:59:21,909 --> 04:59:23,909
I'm fine. Thank you

2066
04:59:25,520 --> 04:59:27,040
And you

2067
04:59:27,040 --> 04:59:33,680
Yes, the audience loves it using english was a good choice

2068
04:59:34,319 --> 04:59:37,650
Awesome. Thank you crazy kyo-san

2069
04:59:37,729 --> 04:59:41,729
Next we would like to hear from sleazy tarashi-san and the bad boy aku-san as well

2070
04:59:42,450 --> 04:59:47,990
First up sleazy tarashi-san. Here's a question. We got from a fan. How do you usually spend your days off?

2071
04:59:49,680 --> 04:59:53,200
Ah, if I get a day off, I mostly hang with my mates and we shoot the shit

2072
04:59:54,919 --> 04:59:57,799
Yeah, a guy like tarashi-san must have a lot of mates

2073
04:59:58,759 --> 05:00:01,080
Tarashi-san, what do you do with your mates?

2074
05:00:02,560 --> 05:00:04,000
um

2075
05:00:04,000 --> 05:00:06,159
We uh make pancakes is no

2076
05:00:08,080 --> 05:00:16,180
You ruined it. Oh, we don't just stay holed up at home. We go out and uh eat lunch at fancy cafes and stuff. Yeah

2077
05:00:16,900 --> 05:00:19,759
Who the fuck is this guy?

2078
05:00:19,759 --> 05:00:22,020
Uh, oh

2079
05:00:22,020 --> 05:00:24,020
I should have covered more details

2080
05:00:25,439 --> 05:00:27,729
Oh, no

2081
05:00:27,729 --> 05:00:30,049
I have a bad boy aku-san to say something

2082
05:00:37,430 --> 05:00:40,819
Uh, don't say anything

2083
05:00:43,779 --> 05:00:46,759
That was it

2084
05:00:46,759 --> 05:00:50,439
No way. He just stood there for his whole panel discussion. That's

2085
05:00:51,700 --> 05:00:53,700
That's so hardcore

2086
05:00:54,959 --> 05:00:56,479
Yeah

2087
05:00:56,479 --> 05:01:02,159
Holy crap bad boy aku-san's the coolest. What a rebel. He doesn't play by the rules. Not even his own rules

2088
05:01:02,159 --> 05:01:04,159
That's what makes him a bad boy

2089
05:01:04,720 --> 05:01:08,229
I'm good. It was the right choice

2090
05:01:08,229 --> 05:01:11,590
After all it doesn't take a big talk to make a big man and attitude speaks louder than words

2091
05:01:13,700 --> 05:01:14,819
Did I do it?

2092
05:01:14,819 --> 05:01:26,020
Here's n were you watching?

2093
05:01:26,659 --> 05:01:28,419
Yeah, I saw everything

2094
05:01:28,419 --> 05:01:30,439
Good work

2095
05:01:30,439 --> 05:01:33,880
Here's n we tried to apply what we learned from you about the ways of the yankee to our panel

2096
05:01:35,000 --> 05:01:38,680
Fan response is pretty darn good. I'm kind of shocked. Do I get money for this?

2097
05:01:40,680 --> 05:01:42,680
It seemed that way. It was all worth the effort

2098
05:01:43,159 --> 05:01:45,000
I think we can keep the yochi

2099
05:01:45,000 --> 05:01:49,880
Yokomitsu silver is going without stay of sagging. They're gonna be still we're gonna be fine

2100
05:01:50,599 --> 05:01:52,119
Thank you very much

2101
05:01:52,119 --> 05:01:54,119
You got a charismatic autobiography

2102
05:01:54,919 --> 05:01:57,860
That's the most fun i've ever had speaking in public

2103
05:01:58,979 --> 05:02:04,180
Here son. Thanks from now on we're going to keep working hard to expand on what you taught us about the way of the yankee

2104
05:02:04,900 --> 05:02:07,840
We'll work on our speaking skills, too

2105
05:02:08,159 --> 05:02:13,220
Keep an eye on us

2106
05:02:13,220 --> 05:02:16,340
The yoko michi silvers are going places. Just you watch

2107
05:02:16,979 --> 05:02:20,819
Yeah, give it your best shot

2108
05:02:20,819 --> 05:02:24,900
Do not equip the book. Please do not use the book. Don't use the book. Don't equip the book

2109
05:02:24,900 --> 05:02:27,060
Don't do throw the book in the trash. What's going on here?

2110
05:02:27,700 --> 05:02:34,419
People sure have all kinds of challenges to face

2111
05:02:34,659 --> 05:02:42,819
At least those guys are diligent they should survive the rough road of the entertainment world somehow don't give up guys

2112
05:02:45,409 --> 05:02:52,340
Yeah, you shouldn't you got something that you're doing

2113
05:02:53,060 --> 05:03:12,880
Keep trying make sure you're having fun doing it. Is it safe point? All right now i'm gonna go bowling

2114
05:03:23,080 --> 05:03:25,319
The book is gonna make the combat unplayably hard

2115
05:03:26,599 --> 05:03:34,610
Watch out

2116
05:03:34,610 --> 05:03:36,209
Who is this guy?

2117
05:03:36,209 --> 05:03:40,439
I'll go back to brawler back to brawler

2118
05:03:40,439 --> 05:03:57,189
Stop hurting these guys. They attacked me

2119
05:04:00,529 --> 05:04:02,049
All right, let's go bowling

2120
05:04:02,049 --> 05:04:09,990
I'm into bowling

2121
05:04:09,990 --> 05:04:11,990
Use the book use the book

2122
05:04:12,150 --> 05:04:16,900
Okay

2123
05:04:16,900 --> 05:04:20,659
Hello, how can I help you? I'd like to challenge the staff

2124
05:04:24,659 --> 05:04:26,360
500 yen

2125
05:04:26,360 --> 05:04:42,610
How many would you like to play? Um free you challenge the staff you get a chicken

2126
05:04:44,279 --> 05:04:45,799
well, let me just

2127
05:04:45,799 --> 05:04:49,159
Figure out how to do it first

2128
05:04:49,159 --> 05:04:51,240
Okay, pull up the position and select ball

2129
05:04:52,040 --> 05:04:55,349
And then you can adjust the spin

2130
05:04:55,349 --> 05:04:57,619
And then just set power

2131
05:04:57,619 --> 05:05:02,500
Okay

2132
05:05:02,500 --> 05:05:12,439
All right 12 pounds adjust the power

2133
05:05:13,159 --> 05:05:17,319
Press left right before releasing the ball to adjust the spin

2134
05:05:22,470 --> 05:05:29,750
Um, yeah, but that was the computer doing that it wasn't me doing that

2135
05:05:37,509 --> 05:05:41,750
All right, let's go I want the 12 pound ball no, I want the 16 pound heavy tank

2136
05:05:42,470 --> 05:05:47,830
I'm gonna do the thing that I used to do when I went bowling and that's you get the huge wicked fucking heavy ball

2137
05:05:48,790 --> 05:05:52,549
And you just roll it really slowly diaper style down the middle of the lane

2138
05:05:53,970 --> 05:05:56,130
Well, I didn't I didn't get a chance to do that. Did I?

2139
05:05:56,770 --> 05:06:01,000
This is gonna be great

2140
05:06:10,310 --> 05:06:19,680
Diaper style is one diaper style is you go between your legs back and then forward

2141
05:06:30,040 --> 05:06:32,439
Too much spin too much too much too much too much too much too much

2142
05:06:38,639 --> 05:06:41,639
See this why I need to do it first before I challenge any staff member

2143
05:06:42,360 --> 05:06:44,849
You mean granny style it's diaper style

2144
05:06:46,479 --> 05:06:49,439
And you can do weirdo style, which is you go here

2145
05:06:50,240 --> 05:06:56,630
Or you go here you throw it diagonal and you try to get it to spin across the entire lane. We're gonna do it here

2146
05:07:11,009 --> 05:07:13,889
That's the best strategy I know what I call it weirdo style

2147
05:07:22,240 --> 05:07:24,959
It was a slight curve just a little not very much

2148
05:07:26,319 --> 05:07:31,040
All right, I got the hang of it

2149
05:07:32,000 --> 05:07:42,919
Let's do a eight pound

2150
05:07:42,919 --> 05:07:47,479
That's really slow. We need a very small spin here. It's gonna be very very slow

2151
05:07:50,659 --> 05:07:54,659
Almost get a striker. I'm gonna leave

2152
05:07:55,750 --> 05:07:57,270
um, okay

2153
05:07:57,270 --> 05:07:59,110
Well, how long you gonna stay here for?

2154
05:07:59,110 --> 05:08:07,680
No shit. Okay. Hold on. It's gonna take some spin

2155
05:08:12,630 --> 05:08:16,150
Twice way too much way too much way way way too much

2156
05:08:21,009 --> 05:08:23,009
Bowling till you get a perfect game

2157
05:08:23,169 --> 05:08:26,119
All right. Now let's challenge a staff member. I get it

2158
05:08:30,310 --> 05:08:32,310
Your bowling form is exquisite

2159
05:08:32,950 --> 05:08:36,950
You think so it really is the angle of your bottom when you release the ball is optimal

2160
05:08:37,509 --> 05:08:39,990
Would you learn how to do that?

2161
05:08:39,990 --> 05:08:41,990
No way, that's amazing

2162
05:08:42,930 --> 05:08:47,409
You know how to position your body with the best effect your form. It's really delightful. Ehehe

2163
05:08:49,490 --> 05:08:52,229
Oh, i'm sorry. It's just that I kind of have a bowling form fetish

2164
05:08:57,959 --> 05:09:01,319
All right, it just went up it went the game went up like two full letter grades

2165
05:09:02,979 --> 05:09:05,139
When I see someone with good form, I sort of forget myself

2166
05:09:05,860 --> 05:09:08,549
I see. I guess this job's perfect for you then

2167
05:09:10,849 --> 05:09:13,029
Yes, I think so, too

2168
05:09:13,029 --> 05:09:15,029
My name's emiri

2169
05:09:15,110 --> 05:09:15,909
What?

This could be the beginning of a friendship with emiri

2173
05:09:27,459 --> 05:09:29,939
Interacting with her will gradually fill the friendship gauge

2174
05:09:30,580 --> 05:09:35,779
You can check the status of this gauge at any time in the pause menu build your friendship with emiri and see what happens

2175
05:09:36,340 --> 05:09:39,409
Yep

Would you like to play bowling?

05:10:14,400 --> 05:10:23,110

It's gonna be good. That's gonna be good

2189
05:10:40,080 --> 05:10:42,229
It's gonna be a strike

2190
05:10:42,229 --> 05:10:44,389
If it's not a strike add a million dollars to the debt

2191
05:10:46,119 --> 05:10:48,200
Oh my god, I get something for that. I have to

2192
05:10:55,349 --> 05:11:00,560
Oh shit tomato, what's up tomato raid? Let's go. What the hell is this strategy?

2193
05:11:01,840 --> 05:11:03,520

2194
05:11:03,520 --> 05:11:10,869
Not a bad strategy

2195
05:11:11,270 --> 05:11:13,830
Thanks tomato. Hope you had a good stream. Welcome everybody

2196
05:11:14,470 --> 05:11:17,990
You're playing um, why am I so why am I sitting?

2197
05:11:18,709 --> 05:11:21,009
Why am I watching her from that far away?

2198
05:11:21,409 --> 05:11:25,599
Aren't we together?

2199
05:11:25,599 --> 05:11:27,599
Why am I across the entire world?

2200
05:11:28,080 --> 05:11:32,880
You're not gonna pick it up. Oh my god, you left one pin

2201
05:11:35,759 --> 05:11:38,159
She sucks. How does it? No, she doesn't you got a nine

2202
05:11:39,200 --> 05:11:42,919
She's wearing heels

2203
05:11:44,369 --> 05:11:46,369
Oh fuck, okay, this is

2204
05:11:50,259 --> 05:11:53,250
Hmm

2205
05:12:00,639 --> 05:12:07,520
That wasn't funny this is gonna be good right here. I think we strike again

2206
05:12:11,240 --> 05:12:17,220
There it is. Oh, yeah, he picked it up. He's all right. He could he picked it up. He picked it up

2207
05:12:26,419 --> 05:12:29,299
I feel like the computer just guessed three or four times in a row

2208
05:12:45,509 --> 05:12:50,549
All right, so now i'm gonna i'm gonna do the comedy thing that happens in every movie by the way bowling has not appeared in a movie

2209
05:12:50,549 --> 05:12:52,549
in like 15 years

2210
05:12:52,709 --> 05:12:54,709
But every time it used to

2211
05:12:54,790 --> 05:12:56,150
um

2212
05:12:56,150 --> 05:13:02,279
Oh shit, i'm sorry. I mean nice almost good. Uh, nice try

2213
05:13:03,159 --> 05:13:04,200
um

2214
05:13:04,200 --> 05:13:07,080
Every like 90s movie that was a comedy they'd be a bowling segment

2215
05:13:07,880 --> 05:13:09,240
with

2216
05:13:09,240 --> 05:13:11,240
Like the person that was bowling would

2217
05:13:11,400 --> 05:13:17,639
Something would happen with their hand in the bowling ball and they would get stuck in there and then they would like fly down the entire bowling

2218
05:13:17,959 --> 05:13:19,479
uh lane

2219
05:13:19,479 --> 05:13:21,479
And hit the pins with their body and shit

2220
05:13:22,119 --> 05:13:25,560
How come they haven't made that joke in like 20 years?

2221
05:13:26,279 --> 05:13:34,180
Did that happen in too many movies and they were like, no, no, no, no more fly down the lane bowling joke

2222
05:13:34,740 --> 05:13:47,139
This is perfect. There it is

2223
05:13:47,380 --> 05:13:49,380
more more more more more

2224
05:13:53,799 --> 05:13:56,439
When was the last okay, I have homework for you guys

2225
05:13:57,319 --> 05:14:00,979
When you're laughing at me doing that, but you just got a gutter ball. Come on

2226
05:14:01,880 --> 05:14:07,720
Um, what was the last movie that had person flies down the lane holding the ball in their hand?

2227
05:14:08,119 --> 05:14:18,689
Uh, it happens in the avengers. No, it doesn't

2228
05:14:23,590 --> 05:14:25,590
It does not happen in the avengers

2229
05:14:26,799 --> 05:14:29,200
No, it does not it does not happen in the avengers

2230
05:14:30,000 --> 05:14:32,069
No, it doesn't

2231
05:14:32,069 --> 05:14:33,029
I

2232
05:14:33,029 --> 05:14:47,139
Refuse to believe that

2233
05:14:47,139 --> 05:14:49,139
Okay avengers bowling scene

2234
05:14:52,639 --> 05:14:56,000
No, there is no bowling scene in the avengers. What are you talking about?

2235
05:14:58,950 --> 05:15:02,150
Wait a minute. Is a bowling scene in

2236
05:15:02,950 --> 05:15:04,630
No, no

2237
05:15:04,709 --> 05:15:14,599
Don't have it right i'm gonna do two. Yeah, here we go. That's a bit

2238
05:15:17,000 --> 05:15:20,000
Perfect strike

2239
05:15:24,020 --> 05:15:26,020
It happens to thanos

2240
05:15:29,029 --> 05:15:31,430
Yeah, the infinity gauntlet gets stuck in the bowling ball

2241
05:15:32,549 --> 05:15:34,720
I don't want to take it off though

2242
05:15:34,720 --> 05:15:37,990
I need to keep it on

2243
05:15:46,560 --> 05:15:52,610
Oh, how wary is it pretending? What do you what?

2244
05:15:53,889 --> 05:15:55,490
Let's not be playing

2245
05:15:55,490 --> 05:16:04,549
Look at that spin. No, no spin at all

2246
05:16:05,840 --> 05:16:07,919
She's pretending she wants she's trying to get me to win

2247
05:16:10,659 --> 05:16:12,819
I just want 56 to 22. I win

2248
05:16:19,299 --> 05:16:21,299
She's literally throwing

2249
05:16:21,540 --> 05:16:26,340
Well, do we get more friendship?

2250
05:16:26,979 --> 05:16:31,139
Your bowling form was as good as ever. Yep. Okay, please come again. You want to bowl again?

2251
05:16:31,939 --> 05:16:37,639
So I just bowl with her until we're like dating

05:16:38,599 --> 05:16:50,229
Hey, it's me again

Redditor room

05:21:20,130 --> 05:21:22,689
Hmm. All right, let's do it again

2271
05:21:23,479 --> 05:21:24,599
You and me

2272
05:21:24,599 --> 05:21:33,939
Okay, shoot. What if she wins?

2273
05:21:45,799 --> 05:21:47,299
It's december

2274
05:21:47,299 --> 05:21:49,299
Yeah, it is december, isn't it?

2275
05:21:49,459 --> 05:21:52,209
All right eight pounds

2276
05:21:52,369 --> 05:22:03,119
I'm gonna try something weird here

2277
05:22:03,919 --> 05:22:09,299
It was nice and weird and it worked

2278
05:22:21,060 --> 05:22:23,060
All right, can I get three strikes in a row?

2279
05:22:23,779 --> 05:22:34,520
Do you think so? I think I can

2280
05:22:43,380 --> 05:22:46,959
Not bad to start pretending

2281
05:22:52,840 --> 05:22:54,840
Oh shit, okay, this is a game

2282
05:22:57,319 --> 05:23:12,360
Okay, I gotta be careful that I don't try to put so much spit on the ball

2283
05:23:13,240 --> 05:23:16,200
From here that I just rip it and it goes too high

2284
05:23:16,360 --> 05:23:20,279
I like to let it go too late and it goes into the other lane and hits pins down

2285
05:23:23,880 --> 05:23:26,200
Oh fuck that's not good. That's not good

2286
05:23:44,209 --> 05:23:47,810
Oh, it's I know. Oh my god, he screwed it up. I can't believe I messed it up

2287
05:24:06,950 --> 05:24:10,979
14 pounds that's heavy

2288
05:24:28,180 --> 05:24:32,259
She's like, yeah, I gotta go back i'm going back down to the six pounder

2289
05:24:33,750 --> 05:24:36,950
That's what I did too. You always make that mistake every time you go falling

2290
05:24:39,000 --> 05:24:41,340
You're doing an incredibly embarrassing

2291
05:24:42,520 --> 05:24:44,520
Roll with a heavy it's too heavy for you

2292
05:24:45,400 --> 05:24:50,040
And you go. Yeah, i'm going i'm going down to like the seven pounds. It's too uh, it's too much

2293
05:24:50,759 --> 05:25:04,610
It's light spin

2294
05:25:04,610 --> 05:25:06,610
very fast

2295
05:25:07,169 --> 05:25:09,409
It's gonna be another strike boys and girls

2296
05:25:16,520 --> 05:25:21,720
And why don't we do it again? Oh, yeah, this is gonna be awesome looking

2297
05:25:22,439 --> 05:25:24,740
This is gonna be like an oddly satisfying video

2298
05:25:28,400 --> 05:25:33,779
Oh no

2299
05:25:38,669 --> 05:25:42,209
Unsatisfying incredibly. Yeah, very much just go straight ahead

2300
05:26:03,520 --> 05:26:07,430
Philly is she on a higher difficulty her thing moves faster

2301
05:26:08,389 --> 05:26:18,880
She wouldn't even heavier

2302
05:26:23,319 --> 05:26:31,540
Back down to 10. All right, it's because of the ball weight. Oh

2303
05:26:43,990 --> 05:26:45,990
It's fun though this we're having fun

2304
05:26:47,330 --> 05:26:50,130
We're having fun

2305
05:26:50,130 --> 05:26:52,130
That's all that matters as long as we're just having fun

2306
05:26:54,450 --> 05:27:00,049
I don't care. I don't give you a gutter ball every time I do too. You're I that's cool. Let's go

2307
05:27:01,009 --> 05:27:02,369
Let's do it again

2308
05:27:02,369 --> 05:27:05,000
Wait, does it have to stop coming here?

2309
05:27:05,590 --> 05:27:09,990
No, please don't say that. We have a special challenge coming up and everything. It's a challenge

2310
05:27:11,009 --> 05:27:15,409
Just a little something special for our customers to promote better bowling skills in sexy bowling form

2311
05:27:16,209 --> 05:27:18,450
Doesn't sound bad except the last part

2312
05:27:18,689 --> 05:27:20,389
What kind of challenge?

2313
05:27:20,389 --> 05:27:23,680
That's a secret. You'll see for yourself when the time comes

2314
05:27:24,639 --> 05:27:30,610
Hmm when when does it do I can I do it now?

Can't do it now

2317
05:27:53,700 --> 05:27:55,700
Oh, well, hope to see you again. Yeah

2318
05:27:57,970 --> 05:27:59,650
That was fun

2319
05:27:59,650 --> 05:28:07,619
Now do karaoke

2320
05:28:07,619 --> 05:28:09,619
All right, i'll i'll end it on karaoke

2321
05:28:10,119 --> 05:28:12,119
We'll call it a night at karaoke

05:28:13,090 --> 05:28:15,330
And then i'm planning on streaming tomorrow

2323
05:28:16,529 --> 05:28:17,889
but

2324
05:28:17,889 --> 05:28:20,689
Might change depending on how I feel

2325
05:28:20,689 --> 05:28:23,639
So

2326
05:28:23,959 --> 05:28:25,959
We'll be playing this by the way

2327
05:28:26,360 --> 05:28:31,000
I do want to give this game like a good proper like at least 10 to 12 hours at least

2328
05:28:32,119 --> 05:28:38,740
All right. I need to like not look at the chat for a second. What am I doing?

2331
05:28:50,340 --> 05:28:52,340
I was just kidding around. I was messed around

2423
05:47:57,909 --> 05:47:59,909

2431
05:50:29,020 --> 05:50:40,840
No, that's all right. I got 98 very cool. All right

That's fun

2434
05:50:44,759 --> 05:50:48,759
It's a good game. It's fun. I like the little quirky storyline stuff little the side stuff

2435
05:50:49,000 --> 05:50:52,569
I know I just said the the word that you're not allowed to ever say

05:50:54,619 --> 05:51:00,790
Save the game. Oh shit. Good call. So stream be on the lookout for sus tomorrow

2437

That's odd. That's too much. That's too much funny

2442
05:51:25,590 --> 05:51:28,150
That's a hundred community subs. What are you doing?

2448
05:51:53,529 --> 05:52:07,220

2450
05:52:25,430 --> 05:52:27,909
But my god, that's an insane amount of subs to give

2451
05:52:29,930 --> 05:52:36,069
There we go. All right, it's saved. It's saved up

2452
05:52:37,419 --> 05:52:41,979
Thank you, though. Seriously

2453
05:52:41,979 --> 05:52:44,860
Uh, I gotta figure out what to do with all these items and stuff. I'll figure that out next time

2454
05:52:45,340 --> 05:52:48,779
So tomorrow keep an eye on sus the sus is going to be set for tomorrow somewhere around

2455
05:52:49,500 --> 05:52:50,860
I would say

2456
05:52:51,880 --> 05:52:54,759
Something like two-ish like two kind of like it was today

2457
05:52:56,139 --> 05:52:59,580
but if I if in the morning I get up and you know, obviously

2458
05:53:00,060 --> 05:53:03,909
I get some like results back and I need to if I feel sicker or something

2459
05:53:03,990 --> 05:53:06,229
I want to be very careful about that too. So

2460
05:53:08,490 --> 05:53:10,490
Uh, I did I felt all right today

2461
05:53:10,569 --> 05:53:11,849
so I really wanted to like

2462
05:53:11,849 --> 05:53:16,490
stream today because I know I streamed like two days ago and then a day before that and then two days before that and

2463
05:53:17,659 --> 05:53:18,459
um

2464
05:53:18,459 --> 05:53:25,740
If I feel sick if it kind of progresses then i'm not i'm obviously not going to stream and i'm just isolating right now

2465
05:53:25,979 --> 05:53:29,779
Until I kind of get the results and figure out what's going on. So

2466
05:53:30,740 --> 05:53:38,090
Uh, I feel okay though. I feel all right. I'm good. I'll let you know tomorrow

2467
05:53:38,169 --> 05:53:45,830
So tomorrow pre-stream give it give the sus a look and we'll go from there. Thanks everybody for watching as always

2468
05:53:46,150 --> 05:53:51,849
There's going to be a lot of community subs. There's a lot of subs tonight. That's going very fast

2469
05:53:54,040 --> 05:53:56,040
