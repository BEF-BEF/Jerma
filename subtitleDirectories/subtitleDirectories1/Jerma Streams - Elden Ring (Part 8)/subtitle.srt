1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:18,390
I am back. How are you? I missed it by one minute. One minute. I'm here. Make an Elden Ring open

2
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:34,579
and ready. All right, that was nice. I had some food, had a little bit more water, played with

3
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:44,759
Otto, hung out with Holly for a little bit. Let me just stir my drink because I can't close it

4
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:54,329
because I have too much ice in it. Just say what you did. I didn't do the thing you're describing,

5
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:07,700
but you know, I do need to plug this in. I don't know what happened to my GoXLR, but the audio jack

6
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:15,480
where you plug in a pair of headphones is broken. I didn't really do anything. I don't get it.

7
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:32,620
Okay, Elden Ring. Let's open it. You guys cannot see anything, can you? No, you cannot yet.

8
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:43,319
What's in my pocket? All right, so I gotta remember what the hell I was doing because it's been a

9
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:51,769
few days. I think I want to go north east. I believe that's where I'm heading.

10
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:13,740
Oh, I gotta change the category because we're in Elden Ring now, not Big Brain Academy. All right,

11
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:24,039
put a heart rate monitor on. I don't have access to a heart rate monitor at the moment. I'm sorry.

12
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:51,780
Dude, you should put a heart rate monitor on. Maybe another time? Very cool. I need to change

13
00:02:51,780 --> 00:03:14,020
that. Oh, why is it getting louder? I am fresh. I've returned. I know the audio is not in sync.

14
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:47,430
Give me one second while I fix it. It'll be good. There we go. There. Hi. Let's go. Elden Ring.

15
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:58,759
This motherfucker looks like he drinks aloe vera juice. Well, I can assure you I don't.

16
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:20,709
I don't drink aloe vera juice. Why? Whatever. Okay, so I came over here because it was a few

17
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:28,139
things I didn't do this way. If you're wondering the character, yeah, baby rattle. I'll give you

18
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:31,899
just some people that are jumping in that are like, well, what's your gear, bro? What's your

19
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:40,339
loadout, bro? Imp cat head, godskin noble robe, godskin apostle bracers, godskin trousers,

20
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:47,000
plus nine bastard stars and a plus four glint stone as your glint stone. Staff,

21
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:57,430
did you bring your notes? I did. I did bring my notes. They're not showing. I did bring them.

22
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:06,060
They're there. All right. Door next to spawn is blocked shut. Who cares? Looking for Lanya.

23
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,620
Haven't found them yet. That prawn guy says piss off. I don't know what to do with that person.

24
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,740
The- I did- I did the elevator, didn't I? The sea offer elevator. I think I did that already.

25
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:33,139
Didn't I put it in? I got this. I remember getting the complete coin. And I think I did that. I did.

26
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:46,339
So we don't have very much here as of right now, but let's go. Go kill the prawn guy.

27
00:05:47,610 --> 00:06:00,069
Uh, I want to go over here. There's this urn tree that I have not done.

28
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:11,240
There's a bunch of random shit over here. Like that. Like this. Like that. So we're going to

29
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:18,089
make our way this way. Why do we still look like this? Oh, we still look like this because

30
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:31,500
something's wrong with my audio. Get this for a second. Only coming through one ear.

31
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:43,819
That's better. Okay. I can hear. All right, let's go to five first. Yeah, we're still doing like

32
00:06:43,819 --> 00:07:04,519
the cat baby thing. So this is area I've not been in. I think this is a church, right? Okay,

33
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:28,089
this trebuchet's launching. Please. Thank you. That was a bird. Okay. I saw a shadow of a bird

34
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:41,189
and I freaked out. I don't think they can launch over here. Shit mean anything? Why do you have

35
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:49,139
a toddler on a horse? Just go see the last vaude. I, it's hard to explain.

36
00:07:49,939 --> 00:08:05,579
Hey, I learned this from Reddit. Are you behind me? Holy shit. You're behind me.

37
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:27,779
That didn't hit him. Oh boy. This is bad. Christ. Oh my God. What's happening? What have I done?

38
00:08:44,340 --> 00:09:11,370
No, don't block that shit. Where is it? I'm trying to get it to kill him. Sucker. Sucker.

39
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:41,580
That hits. I didn't know that hit that many times in a row.

40
00:09:42,379 --> 00:10:08,419
I got to kill the guy behind that guy. What area is this? This area is. Hold on. I can't really

41
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:17,379
stop. Give me one sec. Damn. This weapon's actually really, really good. We talked a lot of shit.

42
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:28,809
Okay. This area is this sort of Northern Lurnia is this church right here.

43
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:33,480
Is this ever jail? I know, I know how to say it correct now.

44
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:37,059
I don't want to go this way though. I want to go to my marker over here.

45
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:46,570
Popium. So many fucking markers. All right. We'll get rid of this guy.

46
00:10:53,460 --> 00:11:12,299
I'm actually destroying people in this zone. I'm annihilating people in this zone. I must be high

47
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:19,379
for this place. I must be very leveled for this area. At least this exact spot here.

48
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:34,149
Yeah, I definitely am. Did you avoid most spoilers? Great mace. Um, yes. The only thing that was ever

49
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:42,139
spoiled for me was the witch quest because I had it on a second monitor over here. And I've,

50
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:48,860
I apologized for that. I already apologized for it. So we're not doing, I got no more guides.

51
00:11:49,419 --> 00:12:05,139
Okay. Up there. Can I even get up there? That seems far away. There might be a dungeon over

52
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:21,139
here too. Ooh, cookie bug. He definitely smoked on that 20 minute break. No, I can't. I can't.

53
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:27,029
I got way too much shit to do over the next like two or three straight days. I can't like,

54
00:12:27,029 --> 00:13:00,279
I can't get like, no, that's not happening. Not right now. Dungeon? Why are they here? How have I

55
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:06,090
not come up to this kind of Northern Lurnia? Where have I been this whole time? Doing the

56
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:14,360
witch quest right? That took almost a whole stream. Yellow ember. Nothing over here though.

57
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:36,759
All right. There we go. I'm watching you. Hey, how are you? What's that sound? What's going on?

58
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:39,639
What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong?

59
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:45,259
What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong?

60
00:13:45,259 --> 00:14:08,519
What was that? I need a bonfire. It's the, it's the bloodborne shit. That's bloodborne shit. That's

61
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:13,960
what they call, they would call like the winter lanterns and they'd walk around and if you saw

62
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:28,179
them it would fill and you went, you died. Okay. Is it just a line of sight thing? If it's a line of

63
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:39,940
sight thing, I may be all right. Is it line of sight? Okay. It's character line of sight. Jesus.

64
00:14:40,500 --> 00:15:15,850
I can't see it. All right. Let me get up there and kill whoever's doing that. What the fuck?

65
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:46,950
Is that a machine? Oh, fuck you. All right. Cool. It's not going to affect me when I'm right here,

66
00:15:46,950 --> 00:16:19,639
right? Five G. Howl of Shiburi. Spell? Shrieks building up madness in nearby foes. 33 faith.

67
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:24,500
At least it's a maddening shriek that causes madness build up in foes nearby.

68
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:42,970
And it's a taunt. That's kind of cool. So what happens if I go up here? What's the, am I going

69
00:16:42,970 --> 00:17:00,600
to get madnessed? Oh, your person is so ugly. No, don't say that. Why am I still getting it?

70
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:12,740
Alleviate's build up of frost. Alleviate's build up of sleep. Scarlet rot, blood loss, frost,

71
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:32,759
sleep. I don't have any madness ones. Do I? Light, sleep? No. All right. Here's the plan.

72
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:36,920
I'm going to go up there. If I die, I die. I'm going to start the process right now. Go.

73
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:59,240
What the fuck is it? What is it? What is it? What is it? Throw a grenade up there.

74
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:27,829
That it? That's it? All right. I did it. So that means I can walk around here without a problem.

75
00:18:27,829 --> 00:18:32,170
It was just them doing that. Okay. Well, that's weird. No chest or anything.

76
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:44,839
But that means I can walk around here without hiding. All right. The actual place I want to

77
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:55,619
go is five. I got the chest. Yeah, that's right. You're right. I got it. That just lets you,

78
00:18:55,619 --> 00:19:09,140
hopefully it doesn't respawn there. This is ruins here too. Remember you look like a Renaissance

79
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:28,119
painting. Now I do frenzied flame village. There's gonna be another one of those things

80
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:40,390
here in there. I have not found a bonfire, so I really have to be careful. Even though,

81
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:48,569
even though I might be a tad overleveled for this exact spot, died from less.

82
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:24,410
Pretty clean. Clean. What is it? Is this a mask? It's not. What was that?

83
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:42,730
Isn't it a spell? An item? It's talisman. Constantly attracts enemy aggression.

84
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:48,940
Okay. Somebody explain this to me, right? In the souls games, they have items like this.

85
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:57,140
What's the point of this item? Why would you put this on? Why would you ever want to wear this?

86
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,839
Make co-op easier. Co-op. It's tanking in a summon for hard mode farming items.

87
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:19,319
Co-op to tank. Okay. That makes sense. That makes sense. You're right. What else is in here?

88
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:55,640
How do I hear something weird? Note the lord of frenzied flame. Boss? Okay. Beneath Lindell,

89
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,440
at the very bottom lies our lord. Lord of the frenzied. The three fingers who holds us in thrall.

90
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:12,859
Beneath Lindell. Where's Lindell? Lindell? Lindell? Three fingers. What happened to

91
00:22:12,859 --> 00:22:25,049
two fingers? Have I been to Lindell? What are the notes? That's not. Yeah, that's true. What does it

92
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:50,869
say? Beneath Lindell. The very bottom. At the very bottom of Lindell. Frenzied flame lord. Okay.

93
00:22:50,869 --> 00:23:08,410
Good to know. I don't think I've come across Lindell yet. Is there anything else here? I feel

94
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:15,160
like there would be, right? A lot of these places have little dungeons to go in, so I'm not fucking

95
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:34,740
missing it. Maybe not. Maybe it's just a village. I think it's just a village. I think it's a lore

96
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:55,049
village. Something keeps making, I keep hearing sounds. Like loud sounds. I don't know if it's

97
00:23:55,049 --> 00:24:01,700
just the atmosphere or what. Well, I don't know. That's cool. Closer to my actual goal, which is

98
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:05,619
no, I'm going the wrong way. But I did want to go to the urtree. Let's go fight the avatar.

99
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:39,700
I need a bonfire now. Really? That's, that's too many. Challenge though. Let's do it.

100
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,940
Okay. Nevermind. I nevermind. I don't want to do it anymore. I was kidding.

101
00:24:47,660 --> 00:25:29,140
Nevermind. Nevermind. Goodbye. Stop it. You might, I might get something for this. I don't know.

102
00:25:30,019 --> 00:26:02,730
Let me do my stupid fucking move. All right. Is there any reason for me to do that? Grave violet.

103
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:11,819
Okay. That nothing, nobody dropped anything cool. Nobody had anything. Ooh. What's that way? Market.

104
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:25,000
What is that? All right. Pay attention. I need, I need a bonfire. It's gotta be one down here,

105
00:26:25,000 --> 00:27:42,250
right? He's going to kill me. Oh, it's a giant. It's one of the fucking bear. Does he care? I

106
00:27:42,250 --> 00:29:01,559
don't think he knows. Get off. Oh, got him. 3000 damage. Yeah. I may be a little, a little,

107
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:12,329
a little leveled up with this guy. It's very possible that I'm a little leveled up,

108
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:17,559
although I have not seen anything in this area. So, you know, I'm not going to just not do it,

109
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:30,650
right? It's definitely a dungeon down here without a doubt. Like a million percent dungeon,

110
00:29:30,890 --> 00:30:14,230
100 million percent. Come on. Hey, how did you miss? You literally saw the entrance. I did.

111
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:38,680
I did. No, I didn't. Tomically large arrows. Where's the entrance? Oh, it was a liar. Okay.

112
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:47,579
Oh, it was a liar. Okay. Somebody that's lying. All right. There's somebody with a bone arrow

113
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:55,160
down there. Whatever. Where the fuck am I? All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

114
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,759
I'm biting off way more than I should. Back up to what I wanted to do. I'm getting too distracted.

115
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:04,970
This is literally the distract yourself video game. You'll see something far away. You'll go,

116
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:09,049
oh, I'm going to go to that thing. You'll trot like 15 feet in front of you and go,

117
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:13,289
what's that? And turn left and just you lost. And then you do something else for like four hours.

118
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:32,539
So focus on the task that is at hand right now. Go to the tree, which I need to get up.

119
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:50,150
Can I get up from here? Who's that? Who the fuck is this guy? Why do you look so special?

120
00:31:50,150 --> 00:32:26,740
Doesn't he look special? He's, he's a little special. All right. He was a little special.

121
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:38,740
Oh shit. I found a spark. Cool. Elum highway, black knife catacombs. Somebody said this dungeon

122
00:32:38,740 --> 00:33:01,160
sucks. Beast eye quivers. The beast eye quivers. Beast eye quivers. I have a beast. Is that to

123
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:11,210
tremble when close to death route? Oh, okay. That just means there's an undead. Okay. Cool.

124
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:21,180
Maybe I can. Yeah. I'm probably pretty level for this place. So I'm not scared.

125
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:33,740
This does not scare me. Yeah. That's the guy that eats the, uh, that eats them, right?

126
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,380
Although who knows? I could be just totaled full of shit right now.

127
00:33:36,940 --> 00:34:02,119
I know I could just be full of shit and I lose immediately to this guy. Oh,

128
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:24,090
there's a stone sword key thingy. Um, why won't they die? What? I want to go in here.

129
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:36,469
Do they not die? These are like the bones people from Mario and I'm not killed. Okay. You can't

130
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:53,769
kill them. Those guys don't die dry bones. Yeah. That's the character I'm thinking of.

131
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:02,710
All right. Just, I, I gotta, I can't kill them. So just, I gotta get my souls. It's going to go

132
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:16,010
in the stone sword key room because that I want to get in there. All right. So what, what's in here?

133
00:35:17,739 --> 00:35:28,010
Oh, what is that thing? Oh, this is acts. Is there anything else? I need you guys to fuck off for

134
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:46,900
one second. Nothing else in here. Okay. Oh, that guy's bringing them to life. Okay. So you just

135
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:56,150
have to kill that guy. Sounds easy enough. I want to see. Why is this guy coming back?

136
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:05,139
That guy was different. I want to see the acts. This is an int scaling acts.

137
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:12,570
Roses who shows the path to the catacombs or the lands between is depicted on the virtual acts

138
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:34,440
summon. Really? Whoa. That's a pretty bad ass move. That's pretty bad ass.

139
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:46,659
What is it? It scales with strength and int. Oh, only 18 strength. Don't think I want to change it

140
00:36:46,659 --> 00:36:52,539
over the baby rattle at this point in the game. Maybe rattle too good. That's it. That's really

141
00:36:52,539 --> 00:37:01,340
cool. All right. No more stalling. Let's go. I have to go through this bullshit. I thought I

142
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:07,340
got hit by it. I was like, how the fuck is that possible? I was about to start freaking out and

143
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:11,099
talking shit about from software. I was going to be like, there's no way it's impossible for that

144
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:35,699
to happen. Stop, stop it. All right. Now I'm fucking mad at this guy. Sorry. I forgot the buttons for

145
00:37:36,579 --> 00:37:51,260
a second. It's been like a week yet. These guys are connected to a sorcerer.

146
00:37:51,820 --> 00:38:14,380
Why fight them? There's no reason to. Okay. I can go down. Let's go down.

147
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:38,980
Now you get it. The crab is like dirt crabs. Are they hostile? I don't think they are.

148
00:38:39,619 --> 00:39:03,940
I think that I'm just unnecessary. Kill it before I can do anything. Rune arc.

149
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:18,940
Ray. Really? The whole point was I didn't want you to come near me, but you did anyways.

150
00:39:19,579 --> 00:40:03,050
So this is obviously not correct. Obviously. I didn't get up there. I can't kill these guys.

151
00:40:03,929 --> 00:40:25,880
Stop for one second. I can't even fucking look. Wait, do you? I don't think I'm supposed to do

152
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:41,769
that. Is that how you do it? That is how you do it. What a gigabrain. I didn't look at any,

153
00:40:41,769 --> 00:40:46,469
nobody in chat said that. I go back and look at the logs and literally nobody when I looked over,

154
00:40:46,469 --> 00:40:50,550
like the precise moment I looked over, nobody said ride them up. Nobody did.

155
00:40:51,429 --> 00:40:54,550
Oh, like, I mean, that's, you know, well accomplished.

156
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:09,960
Yeah. All right. There's another. Thank God.

157
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:27,880
Scimitar. He did it all by himself. No guide. Don't you guys understand? The only way you can

158
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:33,320
play a From Software game truly by yourself is if you play within the first like two days

159
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:49,739
the game comes up. That means offline. Okay. Offline. So no blood stains, no messages,

160
00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:56,170
right? The person that gets there first, that puts the message down. Yeah, they did it by themselves.

161
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:10,840
I didn't do that by myself. See, I looked over and somebody said invis wall. So I just deduced

162
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,079
where the best possible scenario with the best possible place that would be.

163
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:24,710
And I figured it would be here. Am I going to, I feel like I'm pretty overleveled though,

164
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:35,659
but this is really far in. I have a lot of souls. I don't have any heels though.

165
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:44,219
I am going to err on the side of caution, but I need to figure out because there was a lever

166
00:42:44,219 --> 00:42:54,760
I could pull. Is this going to kill me if I go down here? Just do it. No heels. Just do it.

167
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:04,219
This boss is easy. Just do it. It's easy. Coward. This boss is actually easy. Fine. Black knife

168
00:43:04,219 --> 00:43:40,739
assassin. Oh shit. Okay. Well, if I had a fucking flask, maybe I'm doing a shitload of damage to

169
00:43:40,739 --> 00:43:50,599
him. Attack him. I do it. I'm walking the boss room for the first time. I'm not just going to

170
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:55,239
start pressing R1. I'm not just, all right, you know what? I guess I walked in the boss door.

171
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:59,639
Let's just fucking go ahead and start doing this. I mean, I'm going to die in one second. I don't

172
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:19,449
even know what he does. How do I get back there? There's another boss here. There's a second door.

173
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:29,239
You fought this guy already. Did I? I don't know. The Elden Ring is like eight games in one game,

174
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:57,849
so it's hard to remember what I did. Oh shit. Am I going to get hurt? Yeah. I mean, I may have

175
00:44:57,849 --> 00:45:08,789
fought this enemy type 36 or 38 bosses ago, but I don't, I mean, it's been a while. Maybe those

176
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:45,139
souls don't hurt me. See if I can catch him in this. Ooh. Oh man. That's bad for him. All right.

177
00:45:45,139 --> 00:46:00,500
Don't be a fucking idiot. Okay. He's good. You're way overleveled. I did. I'm just exploring the

178
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:22,460
areas I didn't do yet. I can miss every fucking swing. What? Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm overleveled for

179
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:29,719
this area, but it's, I haven't, I haven't been here yet. And I'm not just going to run by it.

180
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:42,179
You got, he, that guy got more hits in than the boss did. Yeah. But he was also very surprising.

181
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:49,369
Okay. That's not it though. Cause this, another not hidden boss. And what was that?

182
00:46:54,460 --> 00:47:02,099
Two things that he dropped. What was it? Black knife print. Mark of the night of the

183
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:10,230
black knives ritual. On the night of the black knives, someone stole a fragment of death from

184
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:15,190
Milliketh, the black blade and imbued his power onto the assassin's dagger.

185
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:25,449
Okay. That's an item. There was another one. There was another item. So it was in one of these

186
00:47:26,659 --> 00:47:36,599
was critical hits, restore FP. It doesn't seem that useful for this particular build. All right.

187
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:45,380
I can, I'm going to try this. Let's see if I die. Nope. I'm alive. Very cool. But there's a second

188
00:47:45,380 --> 00:48:03,980
boss in here. I wonder if I'm going to one shot that one too. Two shot. Yeah. I was waiting for

189
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:14,550
somebody to say that. I was waiting for you to say that. It's a fun fact. George R. R. Martin wrote

190
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:36,780
every single message you see on the ground. Really? That's kind of cool. Don't kill me.

191
00:48:39,159 --> 00:48:56,070
Don't kill me. That's cool. Game fact. All right. So this is this, this is just a boss. All right.

192
00:48:58,139 --> 00:49:01,900
So let me actually level up first in case I embarrass myself and die to a boss. I'm probably

193
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:07,530
10 to 20 levels higher than and everyone will omega LL and make fun of me. And I'll have to

194
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:13,130
look over here and freak out and explain exactly why I died. Something about the button, the D pad,

195
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:18,280
I hit the D pad the wrong way or something. Something about the D pad. It's always about

196
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:28,550
the D pad. So all right. I can't level up. It's probably not that bad. It's probably fine.

197
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:56,230
Let's get in there and do it. Cemetery shade. Okay. All right. All right. Have you heard of

198
00:49:56,230 --> 00:50:06,300
jumping R2? Oh my God. What the fuck? I didn't even mean to kill him. Am I like 100 levels too

199
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:17,289
high for this? What the fuck was that? All right. All right. But wait, but hold on.

200
00:50:17,929 --> 00:50:26,969
I'm only level 89. It's not like I'm that high. And this is all right. So my game progress route,

201
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:39,420
I went like this way and then this way and then this way and this way. So let me ask you something.

202
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:45,099
It's doing the rainy witch quest line that took me like, it took me like eight to 10 hours.

203
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:53,590
Did that? Was I like, was I like under leveled for that stuff, but over leveled for this stuff?

204
00:50:53,590 --> 00:51:06,260
I did Caleb too early. Really? Well, that's interesting. That's really interesting.

205
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:14,489
This stuff is like during the academy. Really? Holy shit. Well, that's cool. All right. Well,

206
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:24,710
that's still fun though. It's just a dungeon. Whatever. 100% Radan was very, way, way, way,

207
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:33,239
way, way too early. Well, that's really cool. That was sick. I like that. Let's kill this guy

208
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:55,929
in fucking two hits too. Why not? I like being really powerful. Oh, this is actually really good.

209
00:51:55,929 --> 00:52:15,099
No more skin suit. No, I mean, this is fantastic. New armor. Oh no. What about the baby armor?

210
00:52:15,099 --> 00:52:28,179
It's okay. That's not even where I wanted to go. I wanted to go up there. I used to have a bonfire.

211
00:52:28,179 --> 00:52:32,579
Okay. I need to go down this road and bang a right. That's what we're doing because I can't,

212
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:44,900
I'm not going to be able to figure it out. Dude, you're distracting me from my Mario Kart game.

213
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:55,019
Dude, don't worry. Just get in last place and hold the blue shell until the last 10 seconds of the

214
00:52:55,019 --> 00:53:12,780
game. I think you'll be all right. All right. Here we go. Is there an bird tree avatar over here?

215
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:24,730
It's a bear again. I don't want to fight the bear again. I want to get up here.

216
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:50,150
The hat. Is this thing alive? Is there like a gesture in front of it? Go get the bell, Pog.

217
00:53:53,900 --> 00:54:08,659
All right. Okay. So I mean, I figured you were going to do that.

218
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:53,750
Um, again, the barnacle. Barnacles. Oh, these things. Oh, really? I feel like this stuff,

219
00:54:53,750 --> 00:55:28,789
are you making that up? I'm really glad you told me that because that would have taken an hour for

220
00:55:28,789 --> 00:55:54,920
me to figure out what the fuck, what the fuck is going on. Okay. So it's a building. With the

221
00:55:54,920 --> 00:56:01,110
remembrance duplication menu, you can duplicate remembrances you've previously acquired. This

222
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:06,789
includes remembrances from which you've already drawn out power. Duplication can only perform

223
00:56:06,789 --> 00:56:24,570
once per mausoleum. So this is boss soul stuff. So I get to have another boss soul. You can get

224
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:33,619
both boss soul items. Could I just take one of these and break it? You could do dual baby rattles.

225
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:40,179
I can just take, does this cost anything? Or you can, I can only just do it once.

226
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:54,420
So it's only one time. So where are the other ones? I killed way more than these two. Where's, um,

227
00:56:54,420 --> 00:57:05,030
like Godric and Margit and stuff around the map. There are other mausoleums, different mausoleums,

228
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:11,349
different turtle. Oh, so I mean, is it worth me just breaking this and getting a hundred thousand

229
00:57:11,349 --> 00:57:18,440
souls and leveling up like three times? You can't do two of the same reward. You can only do the

230
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:35,099
other one that you didn't pick. Okay. I can't do dual baby rattles. If you don't want the other

231
00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:46,360
weapon. Yeah. Which I don't remember what they were in a while. There's only two of like 10

232
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:50,440
potential bosses that are here. Yeah. I probably, um, I don't think I'm going to do this yet.

233
00:57:51,320 --> 00:58:05,659
That's cool though. It's really cool. What you can do dual rattles. I feel like that would be kind

234
00:58:05,659 --> 00:58:09,099
of funny. And then I would be like, wow, that was 10,000 souls. And I'm going to go back to my

235
00:58:09,099 --> 00:58:16,489
catalyst now, whatever this thing is, staff, whatever. There's another one right there.

236
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:26,099
All right. I need to, so that's what's in this pond. Let me mark this. I'm going to mark this as,

237
00:58:26,179 --> 00:58:34,099
uh, like a jewel because I don't, I need to go to this tree. Go up to one. I need to get up to

238
00:58:34,099 --> 00:58:53,269
the tree. Where's the road? Okay. I've got to go this way. Jump up the clip. Oh my goodness.

239
00:58:53,269 --> 00:59:06,980
Are we okay? I think I'm okay. Yeah. I'm so paranoid about those jumps. All right. Here we go.

240
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:12,900
Now we're going to wrap around here and go this way. We're going to go to the tree.

241
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:27,260
I don't want to fight any of you. We go. I could see, I could open that too,

242
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:39,059
but bonfire bonfire somewhere. Thank you. And it's not like in a dungeon on the ground somewhere.

243
00:59:39,059 --> 00:59:58,519
Thank God. All right. I need to level up. Oops. Is that a magic flail? That is a magic flail.

244
00:59:58,519 --> 01:00:18,889
I still can't 47. Oh shit. Okay. Well, whatever. All right. Bird tree this way. Oh my, okay. How

245
01:00:18,889 --> 01:00:21,929
do I get over there? I gotta go all the way around. There's probably a dungeon over there.

246
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:44,900
All right. Do I clean this one of the barnacles too? Not as well. Oh God. Oh God. What just

247
01:00:44,900 --> 01:01:24,360
happened? Somebody threw something at me. Is it that leg? Yeah. Yep. Did I do it? What's happening?

248
01:01:25,159 --> 01:01:48,539
Okay. I did it. So I'm assuming this is the same thing. I'm just going to say it is. It is. Okay.

249
01:01:48,619 --> 01:01:51,500
That's really cool. So I don't need to make that decision now.

250
01:01:52,300 --> 01:02:09,739
All right. Bird tree time. Let's go. Dungeon. I would have put one right here if I was a game

251
01:02:09,739 --> 01:02:33,539
dev. I just want to kill the avatar here. There we go. All right. Let's kill the avatar.

252
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:37,380
Give me the shit I'm looking for. I want more of those flask things.

253
01:02:40,139 --> 01:02:48,250
It shouldn't be too hard considering it's just an avatar. Spoilers for those that have not seen

254
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:56,010
one of the avatars yet. They all fall the same exact formula. They are still fun though.

255
01:02:56,570 --> 01:03:22,760
Okay. Let's kill this in three hits. I mistimed that. Okay. I don't want to fuck this up

256
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:28,280
because considering I'm... I thought I was the body on the ground. I was like, why is this taking

257
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:35,219
me fucking forever to get up? I thought I was the guy on the ground. That was another body.

258
01:03:54,170 --> 01:04:34,969
I'm getting so greedy. Oh fuck. I'm gonna die. Really? Fuck you. What is this reach?

259
01:04:36,340 --> 01:05:04,389
Your reach is too high. I'm out of heals. Oh my god. What am I doing? I'm dead. I'm just like...

260
01:05:06,550 --> 01:05:10,469
I'm like so leveled for this area that I'm just like, I don't care. Whatever. Just hit me.

261
01:05:13,739 --> 01:05:18,820
Like I have to... I can't just like run into the guy and just swing at him. I'm just like,

262
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:23,380
yeah, whatever. I'm fucking way higher than you. I'm just gonna fucking walk into you.

263
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:18,199
Will you get the fuck out of here? Like seriously, like get away from me.

264
01:06:21,429 --> 01:06:24,710
I was... That guy just made... That guy just pissed me off the way he was looking at me.

265
01:06:25,269 --> 01:06:56,440
Good again. Come on. Okay. I didn't like the way the guy was looking at me. What do I get for this?

266
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:03,860
Magic Shrouding Crack Tear. Lightning Shrouding Crack Tear. Holy Shrouding. All right.

267
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:27,420
One of those actually might be really good. Where is it? Oh, right here. Okay. What is it?

268
01:07:28,059 --> 01:07:39,349
Boost Magic Attacks? I kind of want to try it. Fire Attack, Lightning Attack, Magic Attack.

269
01:07:39,829 --> 01:07:56,070
Does that work for this? Might be pretty good. How is it? We're good. I'm good on time.

270
01:07:59,369 --> 01:08:10,300
That's the Erd Tree. That's good. Imagine that on a weapon. That would be... I wonder how much

271
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:27,239
it increases it because that would be good for my L2. All right. So that was the Erd Tree.

272
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:33,819
I went here. I still want to go here. And now I'm actually... Okay. I can actually get over there

273
01:08:33,819 --> 01:08:45,109
now. Go to five first. Fuck, it's still higher. Wait, this way. The physical effects are strong.

274
01:08:45,750 --> 01:09:11,960
How do I get up here? Over here? Maybe I have to go all the way around?

275
01:09:26,899 --> 01:09:44,119
From the Flame Village, really? It looks like I can go this way. All the way around here or from here?

276
01:09:45,000 --> 01:10:01,189
How high up is this fucking thing? I can see it, but I can't get to it. All the way around?

277
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:48,890
Fuck. I missed it. I really want to get up there. Maybe it is from the Flame Village. You're right.

278
01:10:49,529 --> 01:10:58,520
You have to go in from the north. Let's try that. Because that's probably a sacred tier.

279
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:35,060
It's probably a church. All the way around? Oh my lord. Go over the tree? Oh, do you mean

280
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:37,859
physically go over the tree? Or do you mean like, you know, go over the tree. Like,

281
01:11:38,579 --> 01:11:45,529
examine the tree. I thought you meant go over the tree. Like, you got to examine the tree.

282
01:11:45,529 --> 01:11:54,149
I don't think that's right. You were just being like a weirdo saying to like go on the tree.

283
01:11:54,149 --> 01:12:08,069
Okay, I'm just going to keep going all the way. All right. So dude, how fucking much rock is

284
01:12:08,069 --> 01:12:32,890
around this place? How do I get out of here? Cross examine the tree. I, dude, I don't even know how to

285
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:42,220
how to physically get up there again. You know what I'm saying? Like, how did I even, what was it?

286
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:49,979
Go to the village? I think I'm, I came, the village is up here. I can't, I don't think I can even go

287
01:12:49,979 --> 01:12:54,939
there anymore. Unless there's like a specific random way that I have to go. It's all blocked

288
01:12:54,939 --> 01:13:08,500
off by a giant wall. Like this is like, I can't go around this. How do I do it? Maybe I have to go

289
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:19,369
all the way from here. I go from here. I'm gonna go over here because I think I actually went down

290
01:13:19,369 --> 01:13:25,270
and this, I don't think it's a way to get back up. Now if I wrap around, how do I get, let's see.

291
01:13:31,979 --> 01:13:39,739
How do I approach this? I go up here. So I guess I'm going to go up. What's the number? Is that

292
01:13:40,220 --> 01:14:15,510
three? Okay. So I got, this is a million feet in the air. This is way higher than I thought it

293
01:14:15,510 --> 01:14:26,260
was going to be. That's, that's a million. That's, that's at least a hundred thousand feet in the air.

294
01:14:28,789 --> 01:14:53,930
No. Holy shit. And then I got to bang a right up here. I hope there's a bonfire up there. All right.

295
01:14:53,930 --> 01:15:17,130
There's that. There's Jesus. It's the back of the town lore. It's in the back of the lore town.

296
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:26,579
I haven't seen this, whatever this is. This is new, whatever it is.

297
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:52,119
Well, this is, oh no, this is the lore town. Okay. So I'd go this way. I'm trying to just

298
01:15:52,119 --> 01:16:05,289
take a look and see what, do I have to jump on that and walk around and jump off there?

299
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:12,380
I think that's what, that's what I have to do. I have to go through the town.

300
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:33,859
Holy shit. There's one fucking specific way to get here. Okay. I'm in the town. I want to go

301
01:16:34,819 --> 01:16:52,840
this way. Like up here. This looks correct. That is okay. All right. Holy my God.

302
01:16:53,560 --> 01:17:06,659
That was a pain in the ass. Lord Vike, it seems that you were no Lord after all. Then where is

303
01:17:06,659 --> 01:17:12,300
he? Our true Lord, our Lord frenzied flame. We beg of you, incinerate all the divides and

304
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:17,140
distinguishes. May chaos take the world. All right. I'm looking for that guy too.

305
01:17:17,859 --> 01:17:28,659
This is a brainless German woman. Look at the map. There's one way to get here. You

306
01:17:28,659 --> 01:17:34,500
can't get here from any other fucking direction. Not a single other direction, but right here.

307
01:17:35,220 --> 01:18:02,149
That's it. That's it. You drinking piece of shit. Don't you know how leveled I am?

308
01:18:13,770 --> 01:18:35,829
Fingerprint grape and a war spear. This is a faith weapon. So I see it. Ooh.

309
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:51,350
Can't do the ability, unfortunately. That's a cool weapon though. All right. Give me the church.

310
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:59,180
For those of you that haven't been watching Elden Ring streams and were tricked by the

311
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:03,180
Mario tennis stream. German doesn't read chat. He just threatens to put people in meat grinders

312
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:15,000
every few hours and rubs his eyes because he plays the game for too long. I love how you were

313
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:20,390
tricked by Mario tennis. Yeah. That's what I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to get,

314
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:27,750
I'm going to funnel them all in. With Mario, by the way, golf, it wasn't tennis.

315
01:19:28,550 --> 01:19:33,130
I'm going to bait and switch them into Elden Ring where I go like this for the next four hours.

316
01:19:41,510 --> 01:20:00,899
Fuck you. Fuck you. You got fucking baited. Ooh. Nothing special on this. Just looks interesting.

317
01:20:08,439 --> 01:20:34,819
Finger maiden robe. Okay. Yes. Let's get to 40 vigor. All right. That was worth coming all

318
01:20:34,819 --> 01:20:41,939
the way up here. Although I mean, this map doesn't really help to explain that there's only one way

319
01:20:41,939 --> 01:20:50,949
to get here and everywhere else is a gigantic mountain cliff. But I digress. I want to go over

320
01:20:50,949 --> 01:21:04,409
here or do I want to, you know, you know what? No, no, no. I want to go across this bridge.

321
01:21:05,050 --> 01:21:20,329
All right. Use the tier. That's smart. And I'm going to do the flask as well.

322
01:21:21,130 --> 01:21:35,899
I have any more of these? Hey. All right. I think I want to do the magic one and see how good it is

323
01:21:35,899 --> 01:21:45,500
and the heel or the damage negation. Yeah. You can't go wrong with that. I'm very curious how,

324
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:59,140
how good this is. I don't be that stupid. Okay. So I want to go on the main road. We're going to do

325
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:10,340
main progress. Main progress. Although I think I went the wrong way. Wait, there's a merchant here.

326
01:22:20,710 --> 01:22:33,689
You got kind of a dog shit inventory. Yeah. Your inventory kind of sucks. All right. Is there a

327
01:22:33,689 --> 01:22:57,130
better way I can go through the church? We're going right through the gate. Okay. I just,

328
01:22:57,130 --> 01:23:02,520
somebody said, Jerma, if I was in school with you, I would be, I would bully you. Oh yeah.

329
01:23:03,399 --> 01:23:13,020
Oh, you think so, huh? Oh, you think so. Did you, you weren't here when you talked about how,

330
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:21,529
when I told you how fast I was. Oh, give me your lunch money. Dodge. Come here, you little bastard.

331
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:45,819
Dodge. Get behind you. Wedge. Where's my weapon? This looks cool. Holy shit. I want to take this in.

332
01:23:45,819 --> 01:24:19,300
Don't rush me. Oh, what's this place? Greece. This is a big castle. Have I been here before?

333
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:38,260
I think I was at the back part of this, right? He's finally here. He finally made it. Uh,

334
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:45,479
I don't think this is the end of the game considering, um, all this. So no, I, I doubt

335
01:24:45,479 --> 01:24:55,909
this is the very end of the game. I could be wrong. Is there somewhere, another path leading back to

336
01:24:55,909 --> 01:25:15,369
the foot of the urn tree? An ancient tunnel. Huh? I'm about 70%. That's what I figured.

337
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:44,970
Ran. Boys and girls, I came prepared. I came incredibly prepared. I got both halves of these

338
01:25:44,970 --> 01:26:24,899
medallions. The whole thing's going up. You didn't take the tunnel? Well, I mean, there's two ways to

339
01:26:24,899 --> 01:26:33,779
go, I guess. I collected the two halves of this medallion across the world, so I get to do the

340
01:26:33,779 --> 01:26:40,170
skip. I get my Disney Fastpass. You got to sit in line at Space Mountain for like fucking four hours.

341
01:26:55,699 --> 01:27:09,739
Damn. Where the hell am I? These, those guys are out, out his plateau. All right.

342
01:27:12,649 --> 01:27:19,539
When everyone has a Fastpass, no one will have one. Yeah, I mean, they do times now, right?

343
01:27:21,659 --> 01:27:25,500
Didn't it used to be if you had a Fastpass, you just walked into the line. There was a Fastpass

344
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:33,960
lane. You just walked in it. That didn't last very long, did it? See, now it's like, when do you want

345
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:40,380
to ride the Millennium Falcon ride? Uh, how does like 415 sound? And you come back at 415 and you're

346
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:50,460
getting another line, right? But it's like faster. This is really, really pretty. Sometimes the

347
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:54,939
Fastpass is just as long. Are I going to kill these guys? Or am I going to get, am I going to get

348
01:27:54,939 --> 01:28:10,300
a shit on here? Let's find out about how much trouble these guys were giving me like 12 hours

349
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:18,329
ago, 20 hours ago in game. I tried to fight one of these guys. Overleveled Andy. Um, look, I did,

350
01:28:18,329 --> 01:28:24,409
I explored the world of the Elden Ring, okay? Just because I might be a little overleveled.

351
01:28:24,649 --> 01:28:33,619
It was exploring the world of the Lands Between. I got every tourist attraction hat.

352
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:42,520
I got every mug from every part of Disney World. I would love to get over there.

353
01:28:56,329 --> 01:29:10,659
Overleveled. Giants are not aggressive. I have like four of those. A map fragment would be

354
01:29:10,659 --> 01:29:30,170
Pog right now. Looks like Fall here. Map fragment. Not on this map. Damn, okay, well, just keep on.

355
01:29:30,170 --> 01:29:34,090
Overleveled, underscaled. Actually, I've been doing pretty well in this game so far.

356
01:29:34,970 --> 01:29:56,569
You can go see the VODs. You can read the logs. What's this? Oh my god, an alien! Did he just

357
01:29:56,569 --> 01:30:02,500
shoot himself in the head with his arrow? What did he just do? I think he just shot himself in the

358
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:28,520
head with his bow and arrow. I didn't hit him. Oh, I did. Am I a bit overleveled? I don't think so.

359
01:30:29,479 --> 01:30:44,569
But I've been exploring the Lands of Elden Ring. I spent two days in Limgrave. It was a lot of fun.

360
01:30:45,289 --> 01:31:06,949
Oh, I want to try this thing. The cheese overpowered Andy. This is the first time I've

361
01:31:06,949 --> 01:31:13,319
ever seen this place. I'll tell you, it was a witch quest. I got so obsessed with it and it

362
01:31:13,319 --> 01:31:19,079
ended up taking like, it took like a full 10-hour day to beat the witch quest. I leveled up like

363
01:31:19,079 --> 01:31:29,380
20 times doing the witch quest. I'm not, you're not, I'm not overleveled. All right. Yeah, I'm

364
01:31:29,380 --> 01:31:40,520
not overleveled. I'm fine. I just have a really strong weapon. I'll take a map fragment, please.

365
01:31:41,079 --> 01:31:50,699
Yeah, I slingshot myself. I did the witch quest way too early and it was really difficult. And I

366
01:31:50,699 --> 01:31:55,420
like went to Radan wicked early and way, way too early. And then I got a shitload of souls from

367
01:31:55,420 --> 01:32:13,109
doing that. Wham. And I launched myself into the stratosphere. This is great though. Is that a map

368
01:32:13,109 --> 01:32:18,630
thingy right there? Yes. There's one here and there's one here. Let's get them both.

369
01:32:19,270 --> 01:32:38,069
You were overleveled for Radan. And now I know that's bait bullshit. Now I know that that's

370
01:32:38,069 --> 01:33:06,039
bait bullshit. Old Fang? Okay. Nobody is overleveled for Radan. That's true.

371
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:13,430
Oh, urd tree. Great urd tree. The golden order itself unwavering stretched to the sky.

372
01:33:14,069 --> 01:33:18,710
Confer your guidance to our Elden Lord to put this weary world to rights.

373
01:33:19,350 --> 01:33:36,939
We're getting close to this thing. Is Radan still your least favorite boss? Yeah, without a doubt.

374
01:33:36,939 --> 01:33:53,689
One of the game's hardest bosses. Yeah, it's just, I don't know. I, it was a cool idea,

375
01:33:54,489 --> 01:33:57,609
but I don't know. I'd rather just fight the guy instead of just running around like a dickhead

376
01:33:57,609 --> 01:34:08,659
with like a thousand summons. Anyway, I guess you can, but it'd be hard. All right. Urd tree in the

377
01:34:08,659 --> 01:34:20,869
middle. Dungeon here. Thing here. Urd tree. Oh my god, I'm gonna throw up on stream. And then

378
01:34:20,869 --> 01:34:50,279
whatever this is. All right, let's begin. Ooh. Ooh, what's that? Is that one of those tortoise

379
01:34:50,279 --> 01:35:01,770
missions? I don't, I don't want to do a tortoise mission right now. What's going on there?

380
01:35:11,739 --> 01:35:38,859
Do you fucking die? What is this big banner? Ah, hello. Do you take your fingers and go like that?

381
01:35:38,859 --> 01:36:02,789
Like here? What? What? Moons of gold. I don't know. I'm just imagining like, let me read them.

382
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:27,800
Ah, yes. To the west of that, right? All right. So what you're saying is getting that cast on

383
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:42,789
slay the goddamn demon. You can do that. All right. We have some things to look at here first.

384
01:36:43,510 --> 01:37:02,180
I hear a merchant. Merchant? I heard like the, ah, there you are.

385
01:37:12,859 --> 01:37:25,109
You got way better stuff. Breezer coat, frosty tower shield, scorpion kite shield.

386
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:45,819
Damn. Did I get some of this cookbook stuff? Imp shades, unseen assassins, ancient dragon's

387
01:37:45,819 --> 01:37:57,579
apostle cookbook. That sounds important. You got great stuff. What are you talking about?

388
01:37:57,579 --> 01:38:04,329
You got some of the best stuff I've seen so far. All right. Where's this going to take me?

389
01:38:04,890 --> 01:38:30,600
What did that unlock? Anything cool? Not really. Hmm. That's actually a really good tip.

390
01:38:30,600 --> 01:39:08,180
Somebody said I can hit X on it and it'll show me. That's kind of where I wanted to go. East

391
01:39:08,180 --> 01:39:36,100
windmill pastor. Can I dance too? Ah, I didn't even do anything. What the? Why are you mad at me?

392
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:57,850
I actually didn't do anything. Fuck the whole goddamn group then. Oops. That's not a heal

393
01:39:57,850 --> 01:40:19,289
anymore. Okay, cool. That was weird. What were you playing with? Wind, night swords. What's that?

394
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:34,500
Wind, night swords, strength scaling. Oh, it's a, it's a Darth Maul dual handed spinning attacks.

395
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:54,500
Yep. I always wanted to use one of these in these souls games, like the Albert's or like the spinners

396
01:40:54,819 --> 01:41:07,909
things you hold in two hands and spin around like poles. You should respect not this late

397
01:41:07,909 --> 01:41:15,020
into the game. I've got the thing going on here. That was really cool. All right. So what's the

398
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:26,500
point with the windmill? I've got to jump on it, right? Well, like attack it. I'm going to jump on

399
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:49,880
it. You definitely get on it. I'll be shocked if you didn't actually get on this somehow. I guess

400
01:41:49,880 --> 01:42:10,649
not. No way in what's the significance of this thing? I don't know. Oh, there's just a ton of

401
01:42:10,649 --> 01:42:22,729
these. Nevermind. Nevermind. I'm going to go, we're going to go to the urd tree and we're going

402
01:42:22,729 --> 01:42:34,380
that way. I got cool clothes. Yeah. I'll take, I'll look at them in a minute. Let me go get this

403
01:42:34,380 --> 01:42:57,720
avatar. It's one of those golden bugs. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't go away. Protection of

404
01:42:57,720 --> 01:43:07,189
the urd tree. That's a faith spell. Bro, look at the new clothes. I will just wait. What's this?

405
01:43:07,189 --> 01:43:33,560
What's on the door? Okay. What'd I get? Increase his mind. How many is here? Yeah. That is a mana

406
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:39,640
hood. Although I don't think, I think having the intellect from the cat helmet is better.

407
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:57,100
All right, urd tree. Let's go. Did you find the Elden Ring? Uh, I did. It's this. It's just,

408
01:43:57,100 --> 01:44:01,819
this is a big circle and the Elden Ring is going to be the lands that the Elden Lords used to occupy.

409
01:44:02,619 --> 01:44:07,720
And it's going to be a huge thing at the end of the game when there's no thing for you to take.

410
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:13,239
It's not like, oh, the Elden Ring. No, no, bro. Nothing's, it's not all about material shit.

411
01:44:14,569 --> 01:44:21,319
That's the message they're going to give us. It's the Elden Ring of the lands. It's the land.

412
01:44:22,550 --> 01:44:26,550
Not the, oh, it's a big shiny thing you put on your finger. Nope. It's the land.

413
01:44:31,670 --> 01:44:47,460
Oh, I want to go to the tree. That's cool. Whatever that is. Ooh, ruins. That means there's a dungeon.

414
01:44:48,180 --> 01:44:58,539
It's just an onion ring. That's a fucking person. I thought that was a decoration.

415
01:45:02,250 --> 01:45:13,420
Death blighted? Dude, look, I just want to get this bug, but I'm dead. What, he didn't kill me.

416
01:45:35,300 --> 01:46:05,189
What the fuck is that? That's not an avatar. That's not an urd tree avatar. Is it? Get over here.

417
01:46:05,189 --> 01:46:35,699
What's this laggy glitch shit? Golden Slam. Okay. I guess these guys freak me out. I don't like these

418
01:46:35,699 --> 01:46:48,039
guys. I'm going to, they don't like the sounds they make either. These guys make terrible sounds.

419
01:46:48,920 --> 01:47:08,329
Well, there's definitely a dungeon, so let's find it. I hate that thing. Where is there?

420
01:47:11,050 --> 01:47:53,939
There has to be, right? There's got to be a way down. Are they on top of it? Here. Where's this guy

421
01:47:53,939 --> 01:48:04,279
going? No, dude. Dude, don't go over here. You don't want to go over here. Is he alive? Follow him.

422
01:48:04,279 --> 01:48:23,960
He's walking into a bunch of minions. I don't want to go over this way. They're not happy. Just go,

423
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:33,640
go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Where are you going? Dude, we've got company behind this. I don't,

424
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:39,000
you know what? Don't look behind you. I'll handle everything. Just walk like normally. Don't worry.

425
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:54,649
Nothing's wrong. What? Oh, that's an instant kill. It's an instant kill move. I forgot. I mean,

426
01:48:54,649 --> 01:49:00,170
the bar is gray, so it kind of, it blends into there. He's freaking mad at video games and he

427
01:49:00,170 --> 01:49:09,159
sucks. I don't like him. You know what I mean though? Why am I this far away? Where did this

428
01:49:09,159 --> 01:49:43,800
just put me? Wait, item down here. Oh, golden arrows. That's probably good. Use the teleporter.

429
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:49,739
I kind of wanted to see what was down here. All right. How scared are these guys should I actually

430
01:49:51,350 --> 01:49:56,949
be? And by the way, I'm going to watch this guy from afar. I'm not going to follow behind him.

431
01:49:57,670 --> 01:50:17,479
I'll watch this guy who's fucking binoculars. Okay. Where was it? Why is it so magical looking

432
01:50:17,479 --> 01:50:27,699
right here? Why is that so magical looking? It's just very magical. Why is it so magical looking?

433
01:50:37,880 --> 01:50:47,960
All right. Where was that? That was back here. Touch that thing and I'm going to literally just

434
01:50:47,960 --> 01:51:08,199
watch him from afar. All right. Go ahead. Go do your thing. Okay. He walks through these people.

435
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:36,390
Oh, I think this might be the Elden Lord. Now where are you going? This would be actually really

436
01:51:36,390 --> 01:51:42,520
funny. I followed this guy for like five minutes and he goes behind a tree and takes a piss and

437
01:51:42,520 --> 01:52:39,850
then just vanishes. Okay. Well, get where you're going, man. What is this guy doing? Dude,

438
01:52:40,170 --> 01:53:14,329
we're walking to like the edge of the earth. Okay. He turned. We're going right here, aren't we?

439
01:53:14,329 --> 01:53:22,039
We're literally going over there, aren't we? It was already marked on my map. I didn't even need

440
01:53:22,039 --> 01:53:37,300
this guy. He's leading you. It's a dungeon. He's literally going to walk into it and he's going to

441
01:53:37,300 --> 01:53:56,119
point. I was going to come here anyways. Well, we're here. Might as well pay him, not paying him.

442
01:54:02,069 --> 01:54:29,140
Pay him. That's kind of cool though. Can I go down? Altus tunnel. What have we got? Dungeon.

443
01:54:29,140 --> 01:54:32,729
This looks like another smithing stone tunnel.

444
01:54:39,159 --> 01:54:40,739
Overleveled Andy coming through.

445
01:54:45,140 --> 01:54:47,460
I should take a rune arc too, just to add insult to injury.

446
01:54:48,340 --> 01:54:55,479
Just walk around here with a rune arc and just be unbeatable. Unstoppable.

447
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:32,550
Hey, hey, hey, hey. What is this thing? I think I've seen a version of those.

448
01:55:33,750 --> 01:55:41,539
Crystals, crystals, crystals, crystals, crystals. All right. What about, can I get up here?

449
01:55:43,560 --> 01:56:10,090
It's going to be those shrimp things here, right? I actually do need these. So this is

450
01:56:10,090 --> 01:56:25,109
bad. This is not bad. This is great. Do you get the urge to play Luigi's Mansion from this game?

451
01:56:25,109 --> 01:56:37,529
Not really. Imagine if I still use the katana. I would kill these guys all in one hit.

452
01:56:38,329 --> 01:56:52,569
All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't be an idiot. I don't know what that was behind me,

453
01:56:52,569 --> 01:57:07,060
but something happened. What is it making? Is it you? Oh Jesus. It's one of those things.

454
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:35,029
Walk through the wall for like five straight seconds. Okay. Let me go this way.

455
01:57:37,189 --> 01:57:57,369
He's a smithing stone. Five nerds rope strikes again. Yeah. I don't want to miss anything.

456
01:57:57,369 --> 01:58:03,670
See my problem with games like this, especially like Elden Ring. This one in particular

457
01:58:05,399 --> 01:58:09,319
is I, I want to see all the cool stuff and I know that I can play another character

458
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:14,680
and just go the ways that I didn't go, but I just, I want everything. I want all the items.

459
01:58:14,680 --> 01:58:17,960
I want all the stuff. I want all the gear. I, even if it's not for me,

460
01:58:19,430 --> 01:58:23,590
I want the strength ring. I want the strength talisman. I just want it. Give it to me.

461
01:58:24,149 --> 01:58:34,340
What about a new game? Yeah. I mean, but I want it now and you've skipped half the stuff already.

462
01:58:34,340 --> 01:58:39,449
Isn't that interesting? It's how you know that there's so much to do in this game

463
01:58:40,090 --> 01:58:43,270
that you could play through this probably five times. These are alive.

464
01:58:44,390 --> 01:59:11,510
All right. Well, let's kill this boss. Make it quick. It is. Oh no, it's one of those

465
01:59:13,750 --> 01:59:33,930
things. I need to parry this. Do I have a shield equipped? I don't. Maybe not. It depends on how

466
01:59:33,930 --> 02:00:21,029
much damage I'm doing. Hmm. I'd still like to pay like this. Not worth it. I need to parry this.

467
02:00:21,029 --> 02:00:42,250
I need a shield equipped. Ooh, excuse me. Holy shit. I killed them. I instantly killed them.

468
02:01:05,770 --> 02:01:20,810
Somber stone miners, bell bearing. They take a ton from crits. Seems like it. Cool. Don't want

469
02:01:20,810 --> 02:01:34,859
the katana? No, I like the baby rattle. I think it's really good. God, I hate one hit moves. Hey,

470
02:01:34,859 --> 02:01:45,079
it's only fair that I get them too. Only on one or two enemies. I think. Was that it? I can imagine

471
02:01:45,079 --> 02:02:01,640
my frustration if I was here 10 levels ago, but just get fucking absolutely stomped. This weapon

472
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:15,939
is called the bastard's stars. That's a cool dungeon. So now let's go here. So this is pointing

473
02:02:15,939 --> 02:02:31,079
me this way. I wonder if it's this area here. Up here. We're going to go there eventually. All

474
02:02:31,079 --> 02:02:45,109
right. Let's let me check this place out first because I'm right here. There's also these ruins,

475
02:02:45,109 --> 02:02:56,359
but I want to see what this is. Oh, a fucking gigantic brick wall. Never mind. Do the urtree

476
02:02:56,359 --> 02:03:22,619
boss. I am right here. I'll try it. I only have two. I didn't sit down. Shit. I already got it.

477
02:03:28,869 --> 02:03:51,989
Is this the boss or is this the boss? Worm is actually his name's worm face. Oh, I hate this

478
02:03:51,989 --> 02:04:30,859
guy. Oh my God. I did so much fucking damage. I got distracted. I got distracted. I did do

479
02:04:30,859 --> 02:05:05,109
so much damage. You just did more. All right. Kill them before you do a move. I'm going,

480
02:05:05,109 --> 02:05:45,829
I gotta stay away. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't grab me. You're almost dead.

481
02:05:46,310 --> 02:06:14,539
Okay. Really nice. Very good. Cool. He used magic. Pogchamp. That was cool. Oh, I can go in here

482
02:06:14,539 --> 02:06:23,529
though. Wait, I could have always gone in there. Yes. All right. I've been here. All right. Let's

483
02:06:23,529 --> 02:06:33,590
keep going. I want to look at those tiers, but I want to go the direction of, I want to go up.

484
02:06:34,229 --> 02:06:48,420
I want to go this way towards five. Why is the stream quality weird? You didn't change it from

485
02:06:48,420 --> 02:07:07,479
1080p from Mario. What do you mean? It was 864. It was always 864. All right. I think I can jump

486
02:07:07,479 --> 02:07:37,079
up this. All right. Okay. That looks, that's where I want to go. That's going to take me to. All

487
02:07:37,079 --> 02:07:45,140
right. That's what this bullshit is from. That's the urn tree. That's the big urn tree. I actually,

488
02:07:45,140 --> 02:07:50,789
I really want to see this. I want to know what that's, what the secret is. I want to know what

489
02:07:50,789 --> 02:07:57,319
it is. I guarantee you, I guarantee you we're going to get down there. I'm going to beat the

490
02:07:57,319 --> 02:08:16,010
game and shit. And you're going to come out the birth canal. I'm telling you. Okay. Don't be a

491
02:08:16,010 --> 02:08:21,189
fucking idiot. You might be overleveled weirdo. What am I kidding? Who cares? These guys can't hurt

492
02:08:22,710 --> 02:08:33,340
me. But if they work together, they can blast. They're working together. Alone, I could destroy

493
02:08:33,340 --> 02:08:54,140
them all, but together they're strong. Villain arc. That's literally a villain's speech. I mean,

494
02:08:54,699 --> 02:09:11,850
I'm just speaking factual information. Ooh, that's good. Where is this on the map? Well,

495
02:09:11,850 --> 02:09:22,310
I'm going the way. I'm, I don't want to go this way. Do I? Yeah, I do. I just want to see it.

496
02:09:29,300 --> 02:09:56,420
Capital outskirts. What's the point of this game? Um, this is one of those ever jails right there.

497
02:10:06,779 --> 02:10:17,180
He's back. Wait, why is he back? I don't want to fight this dickhead again.

498
02:10:18,060 --> 02:10:25,289
Oh, tarnished. I'm back as a regular enemy because you're going to kick the shit out of

499
02:10:25,289 --> 02:10:48,250
me and probably four swings. Nope. No, I'm not going to kill him in four swings. I got to remember

500
02:10:48,810 --> 02:10:53,930
how to fight against Margaret, which it's been like, it's been like two weeks.

501
02:11:16,220 --> 02:12:22,810
No, that was so much. It was so greedy to do that. Let's get funky and get funky. Get funky.

502
02:12:30,020 --> 02:12:33,460
Ooh, 905 damage. That was a lot. See you later, Margaret.

503
02:12:34,420 --> 02:13:00,649
Now what? Viridian Amber Medallion plus one. What's that? Greatly raises maximum stamina.

504
02:13:00,649 --> 02:13:13,930
That's kind of a big deal. 13. Was it 13%? He's probably going to come back again.

505
02:13:14,869 --> 02:13:25,020
Maybe. That was cool though. I want that map fragment before I do anything else.

506
02:13:34,550 --> 02:13:51,020
I think I have enough in the map. I'm going to the. Yes, I am. You missed the guy on the ground.

507
02:14:07,479 --> 02:14:50,020
Jesus, that was a, that was a elaborate move. Open your game facts window. Hit him.

508
02:14:50,739 --> 02:16:07,029
What is this hitbox? Yeah. Dude, his hitbox is so weird. It's like, I feel like I'm like swing,

509
02:16:07,029 --> 02:16:25,079
like just like his body that threw his fucking loincloth. Oh my God. What the fuck did you just

510
02:16:25,079 --> 02:16:37,459
put me? Explain the birth canal comment. The birth canal comment was very simple.

511
02:16:38,180 --> 02:16:44,920
Like you're a baby waking up. One of these days I'm going to be right about the baby waking up

512
02:16:44,920 --> 02:16:51,959
comment and you, I'm going to scream when you know it. It's going to be like, oh, this is,

513
02:16:51,959 --> 02:16:58,340
we have, we, we're alive now. We're the baby waking up. I think I'm in trouble here. Can I

514
02:16:58,340 --> 02:17:24,360
get down here from there? Uh-uh. Maybe I can go backwards. Can I go from here? This is a lip. I

515
02:17:24,360 --> 02:17:53,899
can't operate it yet. I jump on this dragon thing yet. Oh, I'm right here too. Really? Oh,

516
02:18:34,229 --> 02:18:43,959
it even did the, just you die no matter what. Oh my God. This is a fucking disaster.

517
02:19:22,040 --> 02:19:32,139
Can I walk there from here? Turn the fucking camera off. I'm being a

518
02:19:32,139 --> 02:19:55,290
weirdo with camera on the camera. I don't want it on. Wait at the bottom of Len Dell,

519
02:19:55,290 --> 02:20:08,489
frenzied flame Lord. That's where it just was. So this is Len Dell underneath Len Dell.

520
02:20:09,129 --> 02:20:21,129
That's kind of cool. All right, let's start the trek all the fucking way back.

521
02:20:23,450 --> 02:20:47,979
Number two on big wall. Um, I think I have to go all the way around. It doesn't matter. I have

522
02:20:47,979 --> 02:21:53,559
to go from that bonfire. Okay. Down this road, just follow the road. I'm not going off the road. No

523
02:21:53,559 --> 02:21:59,899
matter what, just follow the road. No matter what, I'm not going off the road unless for a grace.

524
02:21:59,899 --> 02:22:31,059
No matter what, only for a grace. If I see one on the road, so far so good. I'm very happy with this

525
02:22:31,059 --> 02:23:02,010
outcome. Okay. Good. Things are going good. Watch out for the, they throw shit at you now. Where

526
02:23:02,010 --> 02:23:12,440
did that come from? I got to go fight that guy. I want to go kill that thing. I do need to find a

527
02:23:12,440 --> 02:23:17,510
bonfire through here though. I want to fight that winged guy. I didn't want to kill it this time.

528
02:23:17,510 --> 02:23:22,899
And I got pretty close. It's just, I got all screwed up. I was a cool fight. I want to fight

529
02:23:22,899 --> 02:23:32,870
that thing again. How did I not touch this? How is it possible that I missed this? Was I just so

530
02:23:32,870 --> 02:23:46,540
just dumbstruck by how cool this world was? How did I miss this? That's impossible. Okay. That makes

531
02:23:46,540 --> 02:23:55,350
this a million times easier. This wants me to go over here, but I'm not doing that yet. I need that

532
02:23:55,350 --> 02:24:01,219
map fragment. I lost 50,000 souls, whatever it is. It's fine. I'm going to fight this thing.

533
02:24:06,729 --> 02:24:42,860
This guy back here. I'm going to get him. You'll see. Let's go. Where is he? Where is he? Only R1s.

534
02:24:43,659 --> 02:25:32,020
Oh, come on. Not this shit again. God, man. Fucking relax.

535
02:26:54,700 --> 02:26:57,899
All right. What'd you drop? What do you got? Gargoyles great axe.

536
02:26:58,620 --> 02:27:16,579
There's only three 2500 souls. That's it. That's it. Is that another seed? Seed, seed, seed, seed,

537
02:27:18,149 --> 02:27:25,000
seed. There's another one right here. Then two. Why they just, they give, they give me these way

538
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:56,540
like candy right now. Oh shit. I missed one up here, but I missed one touch the grace.

539
02:27:57,100 --> 02:28:08,149
It's all the way back up. Oh, okay. So is this the last area or no, there's more here. There's

540
02:28:08,149 --> 02:28:23,079
something else right here. Oh, there's a lot more. Wow. This is ridiculous. This is ridiculous.

541
02:28:24,040 --> 02:28:38,790
There's a ton more underground too. I had two flasks. I had eight golden seeds. Are you shitting

542
02:28:38,790 --> 02:28:56,790
me? I didn't know that. Ten and two. That sounds good. All right. I'm very curious. Look at this.

543
02:28:56,790 --> 02:29:15,239
Okay. Is this shit down here? All right. I think I want to find the way to connect this just to have

544
02:29:15,239 --> 02:29:23,879
the bonfire and connect it. So I'm going to keep going through here because I, I want to find

545
02:29:23,879 --> 02:29:35,420
the connection here. I'm assuming I'm going to be going this way. Not this way. Um, wait, this way.

546
02:29:35,420 --> 02:30:00,260
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh, through the doors. I'm already going this way. All right. So if I go

547
02:30:00,260 --> 02:30:13,030
up here, because I already have a bonfire, that's all the way up. Is this what you're saying? I

548
02:30:13,030 --> 02:30:43,610
missed one. I did miss one. That's crazy. Okay. This way. All right. Let's go. What the hell are

549
02:30:43,610 --> 02:31:02,969
you guys even doing here anymore? Damn it. They're just chilling. What? Why they just get out of

550
02:31:02,969 --> 02:31:38,540
here. Okay. Can I open the front door? Lost ashes of war. I definitely cannot go in this way. So

551
02:31:38,540 --> 02:31:44,469
there's two ways I can go down to the lake or up and around by the tree. And we're going to go to

552
02:31:44,469 --> 02:31:48,950
the tree anyways, because I want to get the, I want more of the flash shit we're going to wrap

553
02:31:48,950 --> 02:32:01,770
around here. I'm going to check out what's going on in this little thing here. Oh, I'm fine.

554
02:32:06,280 --> 02:32:53,459
Let's go. How's the radish garden going? Um, it's not, it's going pretty good.

555
02:32:54,260 --> 02:33:05,350
That's holding a box. That guy was holding a 12 golden rune. That guy had just a treasure chest.

556
02:33:38,360 --> 02:34:09,030
Hey, we're trying to stun them. Use the nebula, bro. Be one with the stars.

557
02:34:13,299 --> 02:34:21,510
All right. You too. Do use the nebula, bro. Be one with the stars. That's my favorite part

558
02:34:22,149 --> 02:34:48,790
of what you just said. Okay. Up. Ah, I can go up here. Nebula is only good when I'm very

559
02:34:48,790 --> 02:34:54,299
confident that I can get its utilization down. Can't just do it just nilly nilly.

560
02:35:04,739 --> 02:35:19,860
What the fuck is that? Stop. All right. What's up here? I'm weird. Something interesting.

561
02:35:20,420 --> 02:35:29,139
I'm probably right in the middle.

562
02:35:38,920 --> 02:36:08,389
The skulls are alive. I guarantee if I come back here at midnight,

563
02:36:08,389 --> 02:36:14,299
it's going to be a giant skull boss thing here. This is a, you fight something here.

564
02:36:14,299 --> 02:36:43,899
There's no way you don't guide Andy. Nope. I'm just telling you. That's what I think happens.

565
02:36:44,819 --> 02:37:05,059
It might not happen, but that's what I think. Ooh, that's not even from a nerd tree. Okay.

566
02:37:05,780 --> 02:37:10,680
Let's I got to, I got to investigate that shit. What's going on down there.

567
02:37:11,319 --> 02:37:22,309
It's like a little congregation down there. I'm going, let's go. Is that the urtree boss?

568
02:37:22,309 --> 02:37:24,950
I don't know what that is, but I want to go. Come on, come on, come on. I want to go now.

569
02:37:24,950 --> 02:37:42,059
I want to go now. I don't want to wait. Okay. Here we go. What's going on down here.

570
02:37:42,700 --> 02:38:30,180
It is an urtree boss. What was that? What the fuck? Not too much trouble. What do we got?

571
02:38:30,180 --> 02:38:45,260
That's it? Okay. Easy. Yep. Golden sunflower. Oh, that's not the item.

572
02:38:46,280 --> 02:38:59,940
Twiggy cracked tier. Crimson crystal tier. Dungeon. No, I got to look at what these,

573
02:38:59,940 --> 02:39:08,149
some of these are. This guy's cracked out. I'm getting a little tired, but I wouldn't say I'm,

574
02:39:08,149 --> 02:39:13,750
I think I'm the reverse of cracked out right now. I think I cracked out all my potential crack

575
02:39:14,549 --> 02:39:20,250
during the rain age portion of the stream, which was sapped me of all my brain cells.

576
02:39:20,889 --> 02:39:27,000
Oh, okay. That's giant. Very cool. There's definitely a dungeon down here.

577
02:39:35,610 --> 02:39:51,420
Absolutely a dungeon over here somewhere on the edge somewhere. Come on.

578
02:39:51,420 --> 02:39:58,260
It's gotta be one. Come on. Dungeon finding Daniel. Yeah. It's one of the coolest parts

579
02:39:58,260 --> 02:40:01,780
of the whole game. It is in fact, probably the coolest part of the whole game.

580
02:40:09,770 --> 02:40:39,829
All right. Well, you have to stop that now. Oh, he's shooting now where he is. All of you stop.

581
02:40:40,709 --> 02:41:35,590
Oh, please. 1875 damage. Now let's kill this guy. These legs are blocked. We have to play this

582
02:41:35,590 --> 02:41:46,170
smartly. Free hit. We've already fought one of these guys before. Lots of experience.

583
02:41:47,129 --> 02:42:42,489
I forgot about that one. Get over there and hit his hands, please. Gotta be on his left.

584
02:43:02,659 --> 02:43:45,340
Hands down. Come on. Thank you. Yes. He has a hundred trillion health. I know his legs can break.

585
02:43:45,979 --> 02:44:06,180
Did I try that already? He actually hit me with it. Are you full of shit? Are you full of shit or

586
02:44:06,180 --> 02:44:24,520
what? You throw me off my game. I'm just going to fight him the way I know how to fight him.

587
02:44:24,520 --> 02:44:59,639
All right. Now he's dead. No, I want an item. I wanted the item. What did he drop?

588
02:45:01,030 --> 02:45:27,159
Oh my fucking God. What did he have? He just, you just get the axe. Really? That's it?

589
02:45:27,159 --> 02:45:34,329
I swear those guys have a chance to drop something better. Their helmet or something.

590
02:45:34,329 --> 02:45:46,489
Like their armor. No, don't even say it. Don't tell me. Cause now I'm like realizing like,

591
02:45:47,209 --> 02:45:50,870
that doesn't make any sense. How would I wear that? It would be huge.

592
02:46:04,440 --> 02:46:30,739
I want a bonfire before I go over there. Ooh, there isn't one. Really?

593
02:46:50,469 --> 02:46:56,920
That looked like you could land on that. That looked not that far away.

594
02:46:57,639 --> 02:47:14,309
And he's like, go all, get straight down. You and I just died at the exact same time.

595
02:47:14,309 --> 02:47:20,840
Was that the same place? That would be funny. Okay. Well, I'm going to go fight this thing,

596
02:47:20,840 --> 02:47:34,549
whatever it is. You can drop a crystal. What was it? You can drop rainbow stone to see if you'll die

597
02:47:34,549 --> 02:47:43,500
from a drop. I can't believe I didn't know that. That's such amazing info. I can drop a stone off

598
02:47:43,500 --> 02:47:52,010
and if the stone shatters, then I die. What? Okay. Well, thanks for the tip.

599
02:47:52,889 --> 02:48:06,809
VR Josh tried to share this info before. Fuck. All right. Let's go fight this guy up here.

600
02:48:06,809 --> 02:48:14,360
I should be able to do it. Let's go. You tell me there's not another bonfire like right here

601
02:48:14,360 --> 02:48:29,559
or somewhere sitting right here. Not a bonfire. Has to be one. Has to be. Right? Maybe not.

602
02:48:40,329 --> 02:48:48,840
Ah, okay. I didn't, what? I didn't see it. How did I not see it? I walked right over here.

603
02:48:50,780 --> 02:49:00,620
All right. Tree sentinel version two. Let's go. Draconic tree sentinel actually is.

604
02:49:01,340 --> 02:50:26,520
We got new moves. I'll be foolish. It's not hard. My God. Can I outrun it? If I just keep

605
02:50:26,520 --> 02:50:42,059
running in a direction. Oh, it feels good when you get the fucking fully charged one. Do it again.

606
02:50:42,940 --> 02:51:41,450
Oh, fuck. All right. Run, run, run. Holy fucking moly. That does a lot of damage.

607
02:51:45,340 --> 02:52:24,360
Run, run. Oh, come on. I figured maybe I tried off the horse, but it's way harder off the horse.

608
02:52:24,920 --> 02:52:43,190
It's not that bad. I got it done. I love how colorful the game is. The game is beautiful.

609
02:52:44,069 --> 02:53:02,860
Eternal darkness. Does that do anything? Well, that catches his crazy beam thing.

610
02:53:03,500 --> 02:53:15,049
I have one. Thank God for getting it out of the way. We're going with the other strat.

611
02:53:15,690 --> 02:54:13,989
All the kill him strat. Take them all down. I didn't get away. Why make that a confirmation?

612
02:54:14,950 --> 02:54:20,149
Okay. From software. Listen to me. Listen to me very carefully from software. Very carefully.

613
02:54:21,430 --> 02:54:27,750
If I am going to select, if I'm going to select that item and hit and hit X,

614
02:54:29,979 --> 02:54:32,940
why are you giving me a confirmation where I have to press it on the button to do it?

615
02:54:33,659 --> 02:54:46,250
Why? Why? I have to select it on my inventory menu. Why can I not just do it? Why do I have

616
02:54:46,250 --> 02:55:28,920
to confirm that I want to do it and hit left on the fucking D pad? It's the guy from The Simpsons.

617
02:55:30,250 --> 02:56:23,239
Who's the professor from The Simpsons? Come on, quick. Fucking, it's so huge.

618
02:56:24,040 --> 02:56:58,549
Fuck you, dude. It's too big. That splash damage is fucking outrageous. Three times in a row.

619
02:56:59,510 --> 02:57:36,969
The fucking same boulder. Hold on. Hold on. Wait. I'm not ready to die. I'm not ready to die.

620
02:57:36,969 --> 02:57:42,809
I've walked into the same boulder three fucking times. I've ran into that fucking boulder.

621
02:57:43,450 --> 02:57:46,409
Come on. I'm not ready to die. I'm not ready to die yet.

622
02:58:01,719 --> 02:58:31,530
Oh, he lost his magical juice. All right. I got to kill him. No. You cannot run it. You cannot run

623
02:58:31,530 --> 02:59:27,979
it. I was frozen in fear. Use magic. It takes so long to cast. I'm off my horse. I could have

624
02:59:27,979 --> 02:59:31,500
like switched to the thing, but like I was so afraid to cast because I thought he was going

625
02:59:31,500 --> 02:59:39,479
to do that move where he fucking shoots the lighting at me. Why do I have it? All right.

626
02:59:41,379 --> 02:59:49,180
This is, this is an, okay, listen. This is an int scaling weapon. I'm doing int and dex.

627
02:59:49,739 --> 02:59:58,229
You understand? You understand? This is, this is, this weapon. People, okay, people think that I'm

628
02:59:58,229 --> 03:00:23,379
just like swinging with no stats. I'll get it. I'll get it. I just frozen fucking fear

629
03:00:24,629 --> 03:00:30,629
and hitting, holding Y and pressing R1 and then cycling through my spells to cast and stand still

630
03:00:30,629 --> 03:00:35,030
for two seconds. It's not something I was prepared to do. Falling off the horse with no flasks and

631
03:00:35,030 --> 03:01:20,010
he's got the lightning shit. Okay. I wasn't prepared for it. Okay. You actually can't get

632
03:01:20,010 --> 03:01:33,459
away from that. You have to go forward. You might have to go forward. I wonder maybe to run forward.

633
03:01:41,510 --> 03:01:49,020
Act. Nope. How do you get away from that? Do I just have to fight him off the horse in this phase?

634
03:01:51,399 --> 03:01:57,239
Probably what I have to do. Cause that's like almost seems bad to be on the horse.

635
03:02:05,829 --> 03:02:20,500
Can you jump? I don't know. They come from the sky. Just jump off the horse when it happens

636
03:02:20,500 --> 03:02:43,139
and jump back on. That's going to get me killed though. That's right. Really? That took so fucking

637
03:02:43,139 --> 03:02:56,020
long. Horse has eye frames. Getting back on the horse. Yeah. I'll get off the horse and get on

638
03:02:56,020 --> 03:03:04,629
the horse when he casts it. Right? I feel like I'm, I'm doing the horse dash right when it happens

639
03:03:04,629 --> 03:03:10,069
and it still hits me. Like the horse dash only lasts as long to dodge like the first two because

640
03:03:10,069 --> 03:03:18,870
he goes like one, two, three, four, getting off. Yeah. I'll get off and get on. See if that works.

641
03:03:19,590 --> 03:04:49,059
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, this is, I have, did I do it? I think it worked. No shit. It's just

642
03:04:49,059 --> 03:04:56,299
so hard to be able to, that's weird though. It's hard to cycle through that much. It's hard to know

643
03:04:56,299 --> 03:05:27,879
when he's going to do it. Okay. Here we go. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Do the thing. Wait,

644
03:05:27,879 --> 03:05:33,379
there was no eye frame. What? When did the, when did the eye frame start? When did the eye frame

645
03:05:33,379 --> 03:05:55,829
start? Do you honestly think I don't know the horse has a dodge 65 hours into the game? You've

646
03:05:55,829 --> 03:06:14,520
seen me do it like a hundred times. You can't dodge them all. He's turning. Oh shit. He's turning.

647
03:06:14,520 --> 03:06:33,379
He just growled at us. He just turned and growled. Okay. I need to get my bearings.

648
03:06:34,659 --> 03:07:08,100
Okay. We're good. Okay. Okay. I'm going to beat him. I can't laugh too hard. Of course I know

649
03:07:08,100 --> 03:07:16,260
the horse has a dodge. I've, I've pressed it probably 5,000 times in the course of the last

650
03:07:16,260 --> 03:08:09,290
two weeks. I'm going to die. So that was really funny. I would like to continue to play the game.

651
03:08:09,930 --> 03:08:19,940
That would be swell. Why would it just do this? This fucking guy can't even hurt me.

652
03:08:21,159 --> 03:08:25,000
What's happening? Why am I, why can I kill him like this? He didn't hit me once.

653
03:08:25,959 --> 03:09:22,659
All right. Look dodge. He's full of blood. Yeah. Cause I'm laughing my ass off. Don't listen to

654
03:09:22,659 --> 03:09:35,659
what anybody on the internet says. Just stay at his butt and you won't get hit once. Just literally

655
03:09:35,659 --> 03:10:09,190
don't, you know, just stay up with, just stay up his ass the whole game. It's so finicky. Do you see

656
03:10:09,190 --> 03:10:18,739
how finicky it is? From software. I wonder from software. What I want to do is from software. Do

657
03:10:18,739 --> 03:11:50,420
I want to get on the horse? That's fun. What do you say? And I said, please for the love of God.

658
03:11:51,139 --> 03:12:13,319
Please for the love of God use glintstone pebbles. They've been an upbeat dragon that

659
03:12:13,319 --> 03:12:40,260
lands on this bridge from everyone. You growled at us. I need to see it. I have to see it. I need

660
03:12:40,260 --> 03:12:56,329
to see it. Is this it? Hold on. We need to watch this. I need to examine this. Cause I, I don't

661
03:12:56,329 --> 03:13:12,409
know what the fuck. I don't know what the fuck happened. Oh my fucking God. I look like a weirdo.

662
03:13:13,209 --> 03:13:20,329
Oh my God, dude.

663
03:13:25,639 --> 03:13:34,790
What? Why does it sound so weird? What is it sound so weird? What's wrong with this?

664
03:13:35,770 --> 03:13:38,010
Why do I sound like a, is that what I sound like?

665
03:13:44,409 --> 03:13:58,520
Why do I sound like a fucking cave troll? Oh, it haven't. It doesn't sound much better.

666
03:14:03,510 --> 03:14:08,229
He's like, he's turning. Oh shit. He's turning. He just growled at us.

667
03:14:11,930 --> 03:14:36,680
Oh my fucking God, dude. Somebody said Tim the tool man. But honestly, man, when somebody asks

668
03:14:36,680 --> 03:14:41,559
you, when somebody says, Hey dude, do you know there's a dodge in the game? It's like, bro.

669
03:14:43,719 --> 03:15:14,020
Yes. Fundamental part of the whole game. Oh, all right. That was, that was very funny.

670
03:15:14,659 --> 03:15:24,870
That was a very fun time. Let's take a second here. Let's take a second and relax. That was

671
03:15:24,870 --> 03:15:37,290
very fun. That's so fucking funny though. You know, it's funny. Like you pick up, let me give

672
03:15:37,290 --> 03:15:46,860
you some, let me, here's some streamer insight. Okay. When the streamers mad, like very mad and

673
03:15:46,860 --> 03:15:53,420
the streamer looks over and sees just picks out the one comment. That's just like, Hey yo, bro.

674
03:15:53,420 --> 03:15:59,899
Like maybe you should go back to fucking Mario tennis. It's just like, Oh, you fucker. You

675
03:15:59,899 --> 03:16:05,260
motherfucker. Don't say that to me right now. I'm in the middle. I'm getting my ass kicked.

676
03:16:05,979 --> 03:16:33,000
You're the only person that does that. No, no way. That was fucking wild. Okay. That was fun.

677
03:16:33,000 --> 03:16:39,319
I'm glad you all enjoyed that. That was a good time. I want to see what's in this room.

678
03:16:39,479 --> 03:17:17,819
35 Vigor. I'm not the most unhinged Elden Ring streamer, right? Like I'm not. I can't be.

679
03:17:17,819 --> 03:17:24,329
There's like, there's thousands of streamers that are like crazy, right? I'm not crazy. I'm,

680
03:17:24,329 --> 03:17:32,540
it can't, I can't be the craziest guy. Everybody growls at their audience, right? And then like

681
03:17:32,540 --> 03:17:38,620
it turns purple and I turned, I turned purple. Has any streamer played Elden Ring and turns purple?

682
03:17:39,100 --> 03:17:50,469
Uh, maybe I should stop playing. Maybe I should stop playing Elden Ring. Like yo dude, um,

683
03:17:50,469 --> 03:17:55,909
that's probably not healthy to turn like a dark purple while you're sitting in your chair.

684
03:17:56,709 --> 03:18:09,350
You know, they probably got, you're probably right. All right. I'm gonna fucking lose my mind.

685
03:18:09,829 --> 03:18:34,489
Okay. You're turning into Grimace. So was there anything else in this room? I'm in the castle

686
03:18:35,049 --> 03:18:44,809
now, which is cool, bro. Oh, my stomach hurts from laughing. I can't believe I actually growled at

687
03:18:44,809 --> 03:18:56,250
you. I like, I like growled at you. That was like animalistic. Like what was that? Oh my God.

688
03:18:56,889 --> 03:19:19,020
What a fucking weirdo. You growled at like 10 to 12,000 people. Sky Live? I kind of feel,

689
03:19:19,020 --> 03:19:29,459
I feel bad for doing that. How come you're so shiny? Dude, if that's your, if that's your

690
03:19:29,459 --> 03:19:34,819
actual question, if that's your question as to why I'm shiny, maybe it's the beads of sweat

691
03:19:34,819 --> 03:19:40,389
going down the crack of my ass right now. It could have something to do with that.

692
03:19:44,659 --> 03:19:59,239
I'm sure it has something to do with it. Another bonfire. All right. We haven't heard from her in

693
03:19:59,239 --> 03:20:20,180
a while. This is the base of the Erd Tree. Wait, so we had to bring her to the tree?

694
03:20:26,870 --> 03:20:32,680
Why couldn't she just walk here? Why couldn't you just come here? Isn't this,

695
03:20:32,680 --> 03:20:55,450
I'm about to be maidenless. Yeah. Okay. Well, thanks for, thanks for everything. I want to read

696
03:20:55,450 --> 03:21:06,870
this. Okay. Equipment load. What's the utilization on this? Rank that to get temp equipment load.

697
03:21:06,870 --> 03:21:16,920
Why would you, it seems weird. Rank that and then put on a great axe or something. Briefly stop

698
03:21:16,920 --> 03:21:30,229
rune loss on death. What? Really? That seems insane. So if you know you're going to die,

699
03:21:30,229 --> 03:21:40,809
you just chug that and you don't lose your souls. That's like an oh shit button. I wonder how long

700
03:21:40,809 --> 03:21:59,530
it lasts. Enhanced charged attacks for a time. That's pretty good. It's 10 seconds. I wonder what

701
03:21:59,530 --> 03:22:07,620
it would pair with because you don't want to, you really want to do it with, that's like the,

702
03:22:07,620 --> 03:22:33,000
I'm going to die button. I don't know. Maybe just the heal, just in case. It's three minutes. Well,

703
03:22:33,000 --> 03:22:37,899
that changes everything. Okay. So why would, yeah, just drink that right before you get into a boss

704
03:22:37,899 --> 03:22:52,729
room. Yeah. I'm going to keep it like this. Very cool. So she's like, oh, I'm going to leave you

705
03:22:52,729 --> 03:23:04,809
now. Cause now we're at the base of the urn tree. She's over here. Lynn, Lindell, royal capital.

706
03:23:04,809 --> 03:23:56,860
All right. This is cool. Very cool. It's kind of creepy. These guys are terrible. I mean,

707
03:23:56,860 --> 03:24:06,780
you're really cool looking. They're actually, I like these enemies a lot, but what the fuck are

708
03:24:06,780 --> 03:24:41,190
you doing, man? They like crabs, white flesh. Whoa. Oh my God. Good move for here. Good move

709
03:24:41,190 --> 03:25:00,120
for here. Yeah. Oh, check the ax out. Yeah. Where is it? Gargoyle's great ax. No, where is it?

710
03:25:02,250 --> 03:25:18,860
Dragon claw, dragon, great claw. Like a turkey bone. Wreath with lightning. Can I check it out?

711
03:25:19,500 --> 03:25:41,860
It's not faith weapon. It's just a strength weapon. That's pretty cool. Oh, I got a shield too.

712
03:25:41,860 --> 03:25:56,120
You're right. Dragon. This is a lightning shield imbued with lightning. Damn. Very cool.

713
03:25:57,879 --> 03:26:28,010
Exceptionally cool. I don't know what that thing is, but I'm not going close to this guy.

714
03:26:37,739 --> 03:26:53,030
I have a lot of runes. Maybe when you growled at us. I remember, trust me, I love inside of here.

715
03:26:53,670 --> 03:27:09,129
7k is not a lot. No, I mean these are what I'm talking about. I have quite a few of those.

716
03:27:09,770 --> 03:27:37,110
I want to check this out. Invoiced horn. You can actually use one of these horns?

717
03:27:41,139 --> 03:27:52,540
Is this sorcery? No, it's a faith weapon. Oh, you can blow the bubbles too. That's so awesome.

718
03:27:53,100 --> 03:28:10,620
It doesn't work. No, stop. You're getting spit all in it. No, you're doing it wrong.

719
03:28:11,579 --> 03:28:57,750
Give me back. Take over here. Yeah. Really? Don't do it. Don't do it. Please don't do it.

720
03:28:57,750 --> 03:29:25,829
I am begging you. Don't do it. I'm trying. I'm just trying. What's the chest piece? This chest

721
03:29:25,829 --> 03:29:35,940
piece is the mausoleum knight armor. It's pretty cool. It's pretty good. Been very good so far.

722
03:29:45,850 --> 03:29:52,520
I do love these internal areas though. They're awesome. Very pretty. Very cool. I like the kind

723
03:29:52,520 --> 03:30:03,129
of overgrowth. Looks interesting. All right, so that wrapped all the way around. I guess we're

724
03:30:03,129 --> 03:30:44,549
just going to go that way. The growl. The growl incident. It went that way. There we go. Okay.

725
03:30:45,659 --> 03:31:14,200
I'm going to say let's go this way first. Somebody's behind me. Did you block that too?

726
03:31:23,979 --> 03:31:48,889
Yeah, that was greedy. Where's the nearest bonfire? Right here. Okay.

727
03:31:48,889 --> 03:32:33,209
Are you going to do nintendogs? I do like the flail. It's starting to show that it's very good.

728
03:32:33,209 --> 03:32:57,219
I'm going to get it to plus 10. You bet your ass. There's a lever. The weapon art is amazing.

729
03:33:00,219 --> 03:33:16,709
All right, let's try that again. What? Is there something in the front door? These guys are alive

730
03:33:16,709 --> 03:33:57,350
so let's change that. Okay, remind me that there's a ladder in this room, please.

731
03:33:57,350 --> 03:34:34,489
Hmm. I like this area a lot. Let me just check and see what's up here.

732
03:34:34,489 --> 03:34:48,950
Ooh, that was a pretty good hiding spot for this. Fume bottle. I have like two or three of these.

733
03:34:48,950 --> 03:34:56,250
This place looks like a dream for people that like to jump around and parkour in random places.

734
03:34:57,850 --> 03:35:37,299
I can already see a dozen different ways to go. I'm going to get a bubble on them. All right,

735
03:35:37,299 --> 03:35:40,020
I'll get my souls. I'm just going to. There might be something right here.

736
03:35:52,379 --> 03:36:10,299
Shit. Is the ladder in that room? I just went up it. Make me growl. Don't make me growl again.

737
03:36:12,229 --> 03:36:24,139
Upper class robe. Right green robe worn by noble children.

738
03:36:24,139 --> 03:36:28,540
Donning such a robe is traditionally the child's first show of burgeoning independence.

739
03:36:30,260 --> 03:36:48,629
There's a lot of magic details. Why does this fit? I feel like that shouldn't fit.

740
03:36:50,489 --> 03:36:58,139
Ooh, wait a minute. Okay, what's this? Ah, that's this is where I was.

741
03:36:58,139 --> 03:37:08,090
This is where I fought that guy. Down here. Down there. Okay, let's not make the same mistake twice.

742
03:37:08,889 --> 03:37:34,629
Good opener. Oh, what an opener. So fucking good. Who cares about Katana who? Katana who, huh?

743
03:37:35,350 --> 03:37:57,770
Katana who? So what's in here? It's not a door. That looks like a door.

744
03:38:01,139 --> 03:38:25,590
Jesus. Don't get greedy. Look at this space. What the fuck am I doing?

745
03:38:28,940 --> 03:38:33,579
What's the range? What's the range, man? How far can I do that?

746
03:38:38,389 --> 03:38:50,180
He was far. I thought he couldn't go that far with that old bullshit. It's just wherever you are.

747
03:38:50,180 --> 03:38:54,459
All right. Well, let me get back out there. God damn it's a far run.

748
03:38:55,659 --> 03:39:20,870
Like I'm close to a bonfire there. How late am I going? Uh, probably another hour.

749
03:39:20,870 --> 03:39:23,909
And you just distracted me, which is going to cost me all my souls.

750
03:39:24,629 --> 03:39:31,299
I want that person timed out. Yep. I'm fucking screamer again.

751
03:39:31,299 --> 03:39:52,739
I can just jump into there. All right. I just jump. Is it safe for me just to jump to this

752
03:39:52,739 --> 03:40:38,280
and fall? I don't have to wait for the elevator. Stop fucking this up. Beautiful. Okay. There's

753
03:40:38,280 --> 03:40:47,030
nothing else over here. There's a guy right here. Wondering why I killed that guy in case I have to

754
03:40:47,030 --> 03:41:40,649
kite this guy out. I don't want to bump into that guy. Oh shit. Damn. Damn. What the fuck?

755
03:41:40,649 --> 03:41:53,780
Hey, those guys are horrible. Those guys are nuts. Why do people keep saying better gamer

756
03:41:53,780 --> 03:41:58,360
chair? What's that mean? Better gamer chair, better gamer chair. Why are you saying that?

757
03:42:05,399 --> 03:43:15,860
What does it mean? Where is this? This is down in this weird lobby. It's, it's he kills me or I

758
03:43:15,860 --> 03:43:24,659
kill him. Sorry guys. I know it was a beautiful flute song, but the beautiful flute song turns

759
03:43:24,659 --> 03:43:29,780
into a little fucking like shoe knife that he's like and sticks it in my neck.

760
03:43:37,620 --> 03:43:41,639
Not these guys breaking through the wall. Somebody come through the wall.

761
03:43:42,520 --> 03:44:24,170
2500 damage. What burst burst damage. Damn man. How much somebody else alive down here?

762
03:44:24,170 --> 03:44:37,559
Where are they? Yep. So what do you got? What do you hide in here? What's in here?

763
03:44:37,559 --> 03:45:04,489
Forming stone and ruin or the down. There's a, okay. There's a night standing there.

764
03:45:05,129 --> 03:45:13,590
How many little corridors to go in? I don't know which one is the right one. There's somebody to do.

765
03:45:14,469 --> 03:45:31,260
I killed him already. There's so much cool shit over here. Wait, this is just back out here.

766
03:45:31,819 --> 03:45:40,969
Remember, did you eat? I took a 20 minute, 25 minute break or so in the middle of this stream

767
03:45:40,969 --> 03:46:04,600
and I had food. I ate and it was good. I'm good to go till the end of the stream. All right. This

768
03:46:04,600 --> 03:46:11,319
guy's going to be a pain in the ass. Does he see me already or no? Can I get behind him?

769
03:46:24,600 --> 03:46:56,739
Is it open from this side? What? Oh well. All right. We're going right down main street here.

770
03:46:56,739 --> 03:47:06,549
I don't like this without a bonfire. I don't like this without some kind of bonfire to get to.

771
03:47:07,190 --> 03:47:17,020
That one's going to jump down here. Dude, I don't, I don't like this. I need a bonfire.

772
03:47:17,020 --> 03:47:47,860
I'm going back this way. Come on right here. Is this a shortcut? Wait, this is the front door.

773
03:47:48,579 --> 03:48:17,739
I think this is the front door to get in. No, it's not. Why the fuck would I think that? Is

774
03:48:17,739 --> 03:48:26,329
there a bonfire? I just need a bonfire. That's all I need. Turn around, turn around, turn around,

775
03:48:26,329 --> 03:48:43,940
turn around. I will. I will. I'll turn around. Don't worry. I thought that was a tank. I was

776
03:48:43,940 --> 03:48:51,899
like, why is that? This is weird. Why would there be a like a like world war two tank? That was

777
03:48:51,899 --> 03:49:01,590
kind of weird looking. All right. So this is, this is not the right way then. But,

778
03:49:04,420 --> 03:49:11,940
uh, so I got to go this way, but there's no bonfire. This, this dragon is going to come

779
03:49:11,940 --> 03:49:16,180
to life. It's going to break out of the stone and jump down and have two twin blades. And it's going

780
03:49:16,180 --> 03:49:22,340
to be awful. I could try going this way, which is, that's precisely what I'm going to do.

781
03:49:22,979 --> 03:50:50,299
I'm going to go the other way. This goes up, goes down. Uh, um, okay. Oh, can't make that jump.

782
03:50:55,590 --> 03:51:21,340
Fuck. There's a guy up there. I am begging you. I don't know. Uh, I don't know what you're begging

783
03:51:21,340 --> 03:52:04,379
me. I missed it. I didn't see what you said. Begging you. Ooh, nice. What's that? What's that?

784
03:52:04,379 --> 03:52:18,040
Okay. Nothing. Nothing to be concerned with. That linger is such a long time too. That move is so

785
03:52:18,040 --> 03:52:57,299
goddamn good. All right. I can go down. I think this is the boss. Uh, no, no, no, I'm not ready.

786
03:52:57,299 --> 03:53:01,239
I'm not ready. I'm not ready. I'm not ready. I'm not ready. I'm not ready. I'm not ready. I'm not

787
03:53:01,239 --> 03:53:11,879
ready. Come here. In here. In here. I'm not ready. I'm not ready. Oh shit. There's one of these guys.

788
03:53:15,540 --> 03:53:28,379
Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Don't do it. You fuck. The timings. I just was, he, I did not expect him

789
03:53:28,379 --> 03:53:35,110
to be in this room. He goes bang, bang, bang, bang. I didn't think he's going to do more than twice

790
03:53:35,110 --> 03:53:47,020
or three times. He did four times in a row. I have no idea where the fuck that is. Good luck finding

791
03:53:47,020 --> 03:53:55,690
that shit. It's in this labyrinth down here. Uh, I think I just jumped on the roof.

792
03:53:57,860 --> 03:55:02,180
We begged you. Uh, what are you begging me? Please. Oh, did you do that? Fine. Fine. Fine.

793
03:55:02,180 --> 03:55:25,659
Fuck you. What is it? What? What is that? What? He was going to just keep, he was going to chase

794
03:55:25,659 --> 03:55:44,620
me through the whole goddamn labyrinth and I, I just, just, I did, I stopped running because

795
03:55:44,620 --> 03:55:48,940
it was like this guy's not going to stop. He has a lightning move that if he has line of sight,

796
03:55:48,940 --> 03:55:53,899
he can just ping me with it if my back is turned and I'm going to get hit by it and I'm just going

797
03:55:53,899 --> 03:56:05,000
to be fucking infuriating. And then we got this random dickhead over here. Is this death? No.

798
03:56:05,000 --> 03:56:54,600
Okay. That's how you do it. Stop. Okay. So now where am I at now? There's more shit over here.

799
03:56:54,600 --> 03:57:05,209
Okay. This is that kind of just main road. I went over there. That guy scared the shit out of me.

800
03:57:05,209 --> 03:57:09,299
I'm going to go back over there and I'm going to fight him after I get these items.

801
03:57:09,940 --> 03:57:48,979
These are worth getting, man. This is like 10, 20,000 ruins each. Each. Easy. A thousand

802
03:57:48,979 --> 03:58:03,780
damage almost fully charged. All right. So that's that way. I'm going to just gently drop down here.

803
03:58:03,780 --> 03:58:11,270
Just check over here. Yeah, of course. There could be something down here. There is. There's a

804
03:58:11,270 --> 03:59:07,340
mushroom. What's up, boys? No, no, no lightning. Thank God. He's stuck in the tree. What the fuck,

805
03:59:07,340 --> 03:59:50,420
dude? Wow. Are you a leaf? Killed that guy already. I'm just making sure, you know,

806
03:59:50,420 --> 04:00:02,579
lose your area. Well, I should have drank this thing. I keep forgetting. I have it.

807
04:00:11,590 --> 04:00:47,139
Imped faith is too faith for putting it on. That's pretty cool. All right. Now let me go

808
04:00:48,569 --> 04:01:01,459
to where that scary night was. He was down here. Okay. All right. Here we go. Let's see if I can

809
04:01:01,459 --> 04:02:34,489
beat him. Can't backstab him. Holy shit. Damn you. Damn you pile of a damn that. Wait, did I do a

810
04:02:34,489 --> 04:02:54,180
Stewie? Heroes rune five. That was fucking nuts. Okay. I have enough to level up probably three or

811
04:02:54,180 --> 04:03:17,530
four times. Is there anything else down here? What's this? Still going? Uh, yeah. I'm in it

812
04:03:17,530 --> 04:03:31,940
for a little while longer. Or cut please. Oh my God. There's a door here. Oh wow. Thank goodness.

813
04:03:31,940 --> 04:03:42,260
Just like the old days of dark souls. A skip that goes across the whole thing. Thank God. All right.

814
04:03:42,260 --> 04:03:55,739
It's time to do some, uh, rune smashing. Abundance of runes. 35,000 souls. Damn.

815
04:03:56,299 --> 04:04:11,829
We're going to be a level up probably twice. I need like a hundred and something thousand to

816
04:04:11,829 --> 04:04:34,860
level up two times. That should do it. What do we need? Okay. Uh, I think the play is just to get to,

817
04:04:38,940 --> 04:05:00,360
I think it's just to get to 40 vigor, get to the soft cap and a couple into endurance. I think. Uh,

818
04:05:00,840 --> 04:05:22,090
okay. I'll just kill a few things. The off cap is 60. It is. I thought it was 40, 50 something

819
04:05:22,090 --> 04:06:01,079
thousand. Remember it is. Come here. Stop moving around so much. 51, four, seven, eight. I got

820
04:06:01,079 --> 04:06:21,340
enough. Let's go. Thank God I got that door. I didn't even know that existed either. Okay. Let's go

821
04:06:22,459 --> 04:06:31,100
37 vigor. I want to get this to 40 and then I'll cap it. 50 intelligence.

822
04:06:31,659 --> 04:06:46,100
What does soft cap mean? Soft cap means that for every point you put it into,

823
04:06:46,100 --> 04:06:51,379
into it after the soft cap, you get less than you normally did all the way through 40 to 60,

824
04:06:51,379 --> 04:06:59,379
whatever it is. So the soft cap is 60. That means after 60 at 61, you're getting a reduced amount

825
04:07:00,100 --> 04:07:10,899
per point you put in. So they always tell you, you know, guides, Reddit, gamers,

826
04:07:11,700 --> 04:07:15,219
is to try to get to the soft cap and then get something else up and then,

827
04:07:15,940 --> 04:07:24,520
you know, pound out something past the soft cap into the hard cap or gaps in 99. Right. All right.

828
04:07:24,520 --> 04:07:40,010
I'm going straight down here. I want to fight that oratory avatar. It's right here. It just appears

829
04:07:40,010 --> 04:09:19,100
out of nowhere. Oh, my souls. Oh, magic Mario Odyssey build. What used to gain an enormous

830
04:09:19,100 --> 04:09:30,860
abundance of ruins. Is that a hundred thousand? It's probably 50. Oh yeah. 50 K right there.

831
04:09:30,860 --> 04:09:59,219
Hell yeah. I want that item. I'm still, I don't think I don't see you over there.

832
04:10:05,670 --> 04:10:12,489
All right. Okay. What happened here? Spitting stone and then I want to get this.

833
04:10:16,649 --> 04:10:31,079
Holy grease. Please do your best Mario Yahoo. Now I've been streaming for 10 hours, man. I'm,

834
04:10:31,159 --> 04:10:38,760
I ain't going to get a Yahoo out of me right now. I'm sorry. I haven't had my chapstick.

835
04:10:38,760 --> 04:11:00,920
I've been licking my lips all day. Would you please make a sound effect

836
04:11:01,559 --> 04:11:38,090
so we know that you're all right? Yeah. Oh, all right. Don't be greedy here. Just

837
04:11:38,090 --> 04:11:43,770
I can grab it and run, grab it and run, grab it and run. In fact, why not use sorcery?

838
04:12:28,889 --> 04:12:32,569
Ones of ruins here. They really want you to level up. Don't they? Holy shit.

839
04:12:32,569 --> 04:12:46,139
Can you run here from the beginning of the game? Can you, can you just get here? Sort of. What if

840
04:12:46,139 --> 04:12:50,459
you just ran around and just didn't fight anything and just picked up like 300,000 souls worth of

841
04:12:50,459 --> 04:12:57,129
ruins and then leveled up like 30 times and just wet the floor with the whole game. Oh, you have to

842
04:12:57,129 --> 04:13:06,819
beat the horse guy. Yeah. Nevermind. That's not going to happen. That's true. All right. Was that

843
04:13:06,819 --> 04:13:32,540
all that was up here? Yes, it was. Where am I? Where am I? Where am I? Where am I? Where am I?

844
04:13:32,540 --> 04:13:41,049
Where am I? What happened? Where'd I go? Where did I just go? I went back to like the beginning.

845
04:13:43,059 --> 04:14:33,639
Oh, don't do it. Oh, oh. Oh, he de-aggroed. Hell yeah. Fuck you. That's a bad, that's bad.

846
04:14:33,639 --> 04:15:41,450
That's very bad. Let me get it off. Oh, stop it. Ah, somebody's shooting a bow and arrow like a dick.

847
04:15:41,450 --> 04:16:21,430
Look at you in there. You're so fucking good. Weasley coward. I see. All right. We're doing

848
04:16:21,430 --> 04:17:16,889
like the sewer. Kick the ladder down. Oh, dear God. Uh, fuck it. Still hurts. Wasn't as scary as he

849
04:17:16,889 --> 04:17:30,709
looked. Omen smirk mask? What was that? Whoa. Mask with long hideously twisted horns worn by the

850
04:17:30,709 --> 04:17:53,139
Omen killers increases strength. That is pretty ugly. I don't need strength. All right. So what

851
04:17:53,139 --> 04:18:05,620
was that for? Oh, nice. All right. I can level up again. Lionel's helm. Lionel's armor.

852
04:18:06,420 --> 04:18:26,709
Who's Lionel? Death bed dress. Who's Lionel? Worn by Lionel the Lionhearted. Wait, he was part,

853
04:18:26,709 --> 04:18:56,729
he was at the Redan fight. But heavy load. Still heavy. I don't think I can, I don't have enough

854
04:18:56,729 --> 04:19:12,360
endurance to put any of this on. It's cool though. I could put the gloves on. Sure, why not? I cannot

855
04:19:12,360 --> 04:19:30,790
put the gloves on. Never mind. Too heavy. Still fat rolling. What? What did I put on? Oh, it was

856
04:19:30,790 --> 04:19:46,059
the Godric soldier grooves. Okay, there we go. Did you go to sleep? Uh, I have a feeling there's

857
04:19:46,059 --> 04:19:50,219
probably something right down here. I'll give it a 10th or two and then we'll probably call it.

858
04:19:50,219 --> 04:20:10,940
Let's crush this. Damn. So many. I'm telling you a figure to 40. I think I can get there.

859
04:20:11,579 --> 04:20:29,620
Let's be 20, 30, 30,000. Almost there. All right. Whatever. Okay. I rested here. That was pretty

860
04:20:29,620 --> 04:20:49,989
cool. Sewer. This guy's back. He's just a regular enemy. He's not scary. You're done. Dude, you're

861
04:20:49,989 --> 04:21:00,840
put on the dress. Um, I could look at it. I didn't even see what it did. That was a missed click.

862
04:21:01,639 --> 04:21:06,520
Are you in here? Really? Get out of here. You couldn't even fit through the fucking door.

863
04:21:07,559 --> 04:22:05,299
Don't even aggro him. Just go. What are you hiding in here? I think you just cashed out

864
04:22:05,299 --> 04:22:23,739
all the ruins. I know it was stupid. Okay, here we go. Whatever it is. Wait, we're already, we're

865
04:22:23,819 --> 04:23:17,180
Oh, it's this thing. It's this thing. Right. Okay. Let's go. This is the rot one. Oh,

866
04:23:18,299 --> 04:24:22,620
oh, he's in the fucking wall. No, that's a different move. Oh, he got me. He got me in his mouth.

867
04:24:22,620 --> 04:25:27,659
No, survive it. Survive it. Prove me wrong. Jesus. Fuck you with this weird bendy neck.

868
04:25:46,260 --> 04:26:26,260
Hey, yes. Okay. Golden seed. That boss looks like beyond meat. Did you say that or did he make that

869
04:26:26,260 --> 04:26:38,020
up? Somebody actually say that? All right. So he dropped a golden seed. They're just throwing.

870
04:26:38,020 --> 04:26:45,940
This is just like the boss. Enemies are enemies that are regular enemies here. What's that?

871
04:26:45,940 --> 04:27:00,010
Pulsarated worm. Yeah. I have fought that thing a couple of times before. All right. So that's all

872
04:27:00,010 --> 04:27:26,010
that's over here. Listen, missing something, right? Anything else that he was guarding? Well,

873
04:27:26,010 --> 04:27:50,700
I'm going to level up. Put the dress on. What do you want? Where is it? Slowly replenishes

874
04:27:50,700 --> 04:28:21,659
the HP of nearby allies. It heals. That's pretty cool. All right. Now, now where? Can't level up

875
04:28:21,659 --> 04:28:37,719
yet. Should I keep going down the street? Go down the main street. Okay. Uh, where the hell was that?

876
04:28:37,719 --> 04:29:02,100
I went down to the sewer. My Lord. Not over fucking here. How did I get there? What's this?

877
04:29:03,059 --> 04:29:17,780
Oh, right. There's a bonfire. Let me just go sit at the bonfire and then come out and walk down the

878
04:29:17,780 --> 04:29:24,649
street. Do you feel okay? I feel all right. I'm definitely, it's definitely getting close to,

879
04:29:24,649 --> 04:29:34,010
I'm probably going to call it soon here. It looks so red. Yeah, I know. Let me just go back.

880
04:29:34,889 --> 04:29:46,950
Why am I running? Do I have aggro? Why do I have aggro? Okay. So what bonfire is the best one?

881
04:29:47,770 --> 04:30:05,340
This one here. Yeah, I'm, I'm very red, very sweaty, a little tired and a half hours. That's not,

882
04:30:05,340 --> 04:30:15,190
it's not too, I mean, that's long. Okay. I'm going to go right down the main street.

883
04:30:16,229 --> 04:30:19,030
I would imagine that within the next 20 minutes, we're probably going to stop.

884
04:30:21,739 --> 04:30:29,129
Look dead. Yeah, I'll stop soon. Don't worry. I'm fine. Trust me. I'm fine. I would tell you if I

885
04:30:29,129 --> 04:30:45,530
wasn't, it's just an intense gamer session. Plus I have a light here. This is like an orange light.

886
04:30:45,530 --> 04:30:52,260
So it's making me look a little more red. Okay. So you're saying go all the way down here,

887
04:30:52,819 --> 04:31:11,700
straight through into the store. Yeah, I remember this. Okay. See what we can do. I can go in there.

888
04:31:12,739 --> 04:31:28,520
Wait, I was going to say, is that a bonfire? It is. This would be handy if I knew what this was.

889
04:31:29,239 --> 04:32:02,739
So is there something down here? It's a dick move. Oh, that's a dick move. And they got a guy back

890
04:32:02,739 --> 04:32:21,739
there shooting arrows. Of course they do. Both of you. I don't care. Ash of War Thunderbolt.

891
04:32:22,379 --> 04:32:45,559
Okay, this is a new place. This is a new zone almost. Is he looking this way? I think he is.

892
04:32:45,559 --> 04:33:04,229
Yeah, he's not. Get the items. And if there's anything else down here, I'll take it.

893
04:33:04,950 --> 04:33:32,569
Oh my. Whoops. All right, we're going down here. All right, I'm almost close to a level.

894
04:33:38,630 --> 04:34:05,020
And daggers. Birdsteel dagger. That's new. What does this go into? Broken colossal weapon damage

895
04:34:05,020 --> 04:34:26,150
on that? Oh, I just snuck behind everything. Whoa. Whoa. Jesus. I guess I'm going to do this.

896
04:34:36,619 --> 04:34:59,139
This is massive material. Gravelstone? Somebody's shooting at me and I know from where

897
04:35:08,169 --> 04:35:35,720
I make that. I can land here. Yeah. Lunark. Shit. Okay. Okay. Be careful. I don't want to lose.

898
04:35:36,729 --> 04:35:48,419
I don't want to lose these, so I'm going to drink this. Take them off the edge.

899
04:35:49,139 --> 04:36:27,779
Gravelstone? Lindell Knight armor. Wow. Jeez. Whoa. This place is massive. This is huge. Wow.

900
04:36:29,220 --> 04:36:38,740
I'll take that. I can go down that way. But let's take it. All right. There's another bonfire.

901
04:36:39,299 --> 04:36:54,490
Perfect. Exactly what I wanted. I need to literally sneeze on one thing. Do I have any?

902
04:36:55,209 --> 04:37:09,270
I don't want to use that. All right. Well, that guy's scary, so we're going to go over here first.

903
04:37:10,229 --> 04:37:27,770
Cane sword. Love sword of an aged knight whose last quest was long behind him.

904
04:37:28,409 --> 04:37:51,459
Repurposed into a walking stick. Cool. Looks like... I'm curious. How does it swing? It looks like a

905
04:37:51,459 --> 04:38:07,479
Minecraft sword. This looks like it wouldn't hurt very much. Like a fire poker. This doesn't really

906
04:38:07,479 --> 04:38:25,099
look that dangerous. It's cool though. All right. This looks interesting. Whatever it is. Okay. This

907
04:38:25,099 --> 04:38:34,970
is actually perfect. I'm going to level up. I'm going to see if there's a boss right here.

908
04:38:35,770 --> 04:38:40,250
If there is no boss right here within 30 seconds of this bonfire, I'm going to call it.

909
04:38:40,810 --> 04:39:09,610
Is this a lever? Did that open this door? Did that open the gate underneath me? Oh,

910
04:39:09,610 --> 04:39:14,150
shit. That's definitely a boss. Yeah. Without a doubt. Let's go see who it is.

911
04:39:14,790 --> 04:39:44,970
I'm going to level up first. Let's just see if it is. I'm going to check right now.

912
04:39:44,970 --> 04:39:56,439
I'm going to hopefully don't kill me. All right. So what's down here?

913
04:39:56,919 --> 04:40:16,619
Dude, this is a boss. This is a boss, dude. Who the hell am I?

914
04:40:22,069 --> 04:40:39,740
Ooh. Al. Albarich's pointed hat. How do these people die? Strengthens thorn sorcery.

915
04:40:43,220 --> 04:40:57,110
The robe looks awesome. Where is it? Yeah. Look at this. That looks cool. That looks cool,

916
04:40:57,110 --> 04:41:07,419
but not for me. At least not right now. This is the guy from the round table,

917
04:41:07,419 --> 04:41:15,700
the basement of the round table. Oh, is this the round table?

918
04:41:16,340 --> 04:41:32,389
This looks like the round table. Wait, but if this is the round table, then

919
04:41:32,389 --> 04:41:51,290
where the hell have we been teleporting to? Painting table of lost grace. I don't get it.

920
04:41:51,290 --> 04:42:14,389
Like the hunter's dream. Interesting. It's the real one. All right. I'm out of gas.

921
04:42:14,950 --> 04:42:25,500
This is a whole nother. There's a whole nother like ton of explanation.

922
04:42:27,319 --> 04:42:32,580
Explanation exploration is what I meant to say, but I will get the items because they're right here.

923
04:42:34,169 --> 04:42:42,180
The two fingers prayer book. I scared the shit out of myself. I heard something skittering around.

924
04:42:42,819 --> 04:43:07,450
Oh yeah, this is the round table. That's cool. All right. As much as I want to keep going,

925
04:43:08,619 --> 04:43:16,020
after turning purple at that upgraded tree sentinel, I think it's time to stop.

926
04:43:16,020 --> 04:43:27,900
That was really cool. Is there a boss that's like right here that I can see?

927
04:43:30,900 --> 04:43:37,060
Like right here? I feel like I'm really close. I just want to see it. I just want to see it.

928
04:43:42,169 --> 04:44:29,529
Right here is a dog. Keep going. And this is fucking crazy. I'll explore this better next time.

929
04:44:36,779 --> 04:45:06,380
All the way. How am I? Stupid. All right. I'm going to explore this later. I just want to see

930
04:45:06,380 --> 04:45:30,279
the boss. There's a bonfire like right here. It probably is odd free. The first Elden Lord.

931
04:45:30,279 --> 04:46:32,299
Why is he a shade? You got some fucking moves. Don't you? God. Oh my God. He's so susceptible

932
04:46:32,299 --> 04:47:11,130
to that move. Wow. That's an 1100 fucking damage. Jesus Christ. I'm burning through all my shit.

933
04:47:28,099 --> 04:47:50,900
I got it. I got it. I got it. I'm going to beat him. I'm going to beat him. I'm going to beat him.

934
04:47:51,990 --> 04:47:55,029
He's not, his timing's not that hard. I got it. I got it. I got it right here.

935
04:48:01,700 --> 04:48:10,389
I got it. I got it. Don't worry. I got it. I got it. I'm going to get him. What? Oh, okay. Right.

936
04:48:13,159 --> 04:48:16,200
All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I got it. I got it. I got it. Just dodge. That's it. Just

937
04:48:16,200 --> 04:49:58,459
dodge him. Blocked it. Fuck you. I'll do it and I'll do it again. That was a mistake.

938
04:50:21,209 --> 04:50:39,740
The baby rattles the best weapon in the game. 80 fucking thousand ruins. Holy shit.

939
04:50:40,700 --> 04:51:05,659
Do the next boss. This one right here. Are you serious? New talisman slot, dude. Oh my God.

940
04:51:05,659 --> 04:51:13,580
That's actually, this is going to take me a while to figure that out. All right. I got,

941
04:51:14,299 --> 04:51:17,500
I'll just see what the, I'll just look at the boss. I'm just going to look at the boss.

942
04:51:18,139 --> 04:51:43,340
I don't know what you want to do. Maybe just like the FP. I'll put it on for now. All right. So you're

943
04:51:43,340 --> 04:51:52,650
saying that there's another boss on the HP one. I, I don't want to lose these ruins though.

944
04:51:52,650 --> 04:52:08,020
This is a lot of ruins to lose. Do I need to level up these six? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait,

945
04:52:08,020 --> 04:52:14,759
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm almost there. Just, oh, I can use the flask. That's right. Okay.

946
04:52:15,319 --> 04:52:20,540
I forgot about the flask. All right. So just wait, just check out the boss.

947
04:52:21,419 --> 04:52:31,029
We rest here and you're saying there's just another one right here. This is actually it

948
04:52:31,029 --> 04:52:33,750
though. Like I'm just going to literally walk in and just fight it for five seconds.

949
04:52:34,389 --> 04:52:55,509
Just up the branch, up those stairs. Wait, let go up that branch. Wait, there's an item over here.

950
04:53:07,900 --> 04:53:10,779
All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. So you're saying there's a boss up here.

951
04:53:12,220 --> 04:53:33,500
That's pretty crazy that this back to back boss is, where's he at? Just here. Okay. Yeah,

952
04:53:33,500 --> 04:54:18,299
this definitely is boss. All right. I'm going to drink the thing. Oh, we both have the same idea.

953
04:54:26,680 --> 04:54:51,060
Is that it? More? That's a pre-boss. What about my flask? Is my flask still active?

954
04:54:51,060 --> 04:54:56,139
How was the, that was a pre-boss. Is it, is it actually a boss? Are you guys fucking with me?

955
04:54:56,139 --> 04:55:12,459
I was thinking of the urn tree. Damn. Oh, that actually is. Okay. All right. So that was a

956
04:55:12,459 --> 04:55:27,990
pre-boss. All right. Drink the flask. What's in here? This is the base of the fucking urn tree.

957
04:55:27,990 --> 04:55:51,819
Is it Margit again? Margit for a third time. This is, he's like Kael'thas at this point.

958
04:55:51,819 --> 04:56:17,189
All right. It clones.

959
04:56:25,020 --> 04:56:26,869
We haven't seen half of these people yet.

960
04:56:32,490 --> 04:56:48,740
Is my drink running out by the way in this cutscene? I hope not. Margit.

961
04:56:49,459 --> 04:57:07,000
Oh, now it's actually. What's this guy's problem?

962
04:57:14,150 --> 05:00:07,639
What's his name? Morgoth? No, fuck you. It's going to hurt. Oh man. Oh fuck. I thought I had it.

963
05:00:07,639 --> 05:00:14,900
I'm just too tired. Oh, I'm just too tired. When we got down to like the last 40%, I just was like,

964
05:00:14,900 --> 05:00:26,860
fuck man. It was like colors. Oh, damn it. Oh, if I had 11 more matcha powder in my vape.

965
05:00:28,729 --> 05:00:42,659
One more try. One more try. I thought I had it too. Damn it. Oh, oh, I'm too tired.

966
05:00:44,259 --> 05:01:13,849
Why can't it be like hour number three instead of hour number 11? Oh, thought I dodged it.

967
05:01:14,569 --> 05:01:24,040
Oh, sloppy, sloppy, sloppy, sloppy, sloppy. Damn. Oh, I was so close on the first try.

968
05:01:24,040 --> 05:01:29,659
I almost did it. I was going to be such a fucking gamer. I was going to be such a gamer.

969
05:01:30,860 --> 05:01:44,409
I was going to be best gamer moment 2022. All right. Actual final try. I promise. If I don't,

970
05:01:44,409 --> 05:01:53,049
it doesn't matter. Actual final try. I promise. Use your summons. Oh, I don't have anything.

971
05:01:53,049 --> 05:02:33,880
I was so close. I thought I did it. I didn't do it, mom. Sorry. All right. Let's get him. Oh,

972
05:02:33,880 --> 05:03:13,849
double. Oh my God. We're kicking the shit out of him. Oh my God. Beat his ass. What the fuck? Oh

973
05:03:13,849 --> 05:03:36,540
my God. Why wouldn't I do this the first time? Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him. Jump him. Not

974
05:03:36,540 --> 05:03:46,520
yet. Not yet. Not yet. Get him. Oh my God. That was so easy. That was so easy with the summon.

975
05:03:48,360 --> 05:03:59,340
What? That was so fucking simple with the summon. We just beat the shit out of him. We just comboed

976
05:03:59,340 --> 05:04:17,400
him. The mimic got the last hit. What the fuck? That was so intense and so hard and so ridiculous.

977
05:04:17,400 --> 05:04:22,119
I just rang a bell and a guy came and fucking kicked the shit out of him.

978
05:04:30,599 --> 05:04:41,819
Okay. All right. That was really cool. Mimic is fucking unbelievable. Are you fucking kidding me?

979
05:04:42,619 --> 05:04:55,500
That was insane. All right. Well, I almost beat him first try. Oh, and then I rang the bell and

980
05:04:55,500 --> 05:04:59,700
somebody else came in and beat him for me. All right. That's actually the end of the fucking

981
05:04:59,700 --> 05:05:40,979
scream. I'm done. That was nuts. All right. So you tried to be Elden Lord and didn't work.

982
05:05:41,779 --> 05:05:48,740
Oh, he's dead. All right. So you tried to be Elden Lord. That didn't do anything.

983
05:05:49,380 --> 05:05:56,299
There's another boss behind the door. Check it out. No, I don't know. I'm out of here. I can't

984
05:05:56,299 --> 05:06:16,599
leave. Why can't I leave? This is not okay. This is not a boss back behind you, right?

985
05:06:17,319 --> 05:06:24,520
Impenetrable thorns refuse all. None may enter the urd tree.

986
05:06:25,400 --> 05:06:45,990
Can't go on the urd tree. Why not? I'll level up. All right. That was crazy. I'm so glad I had a

987
05:06:47,349 --> 05:06:57,319
mirror of myself to come in and fucking help. What are you doing here?

988
05:06:57,319 --> 05:07:14,180
Converse with you. You were unable to enter the tree prevented by the mantle of the thorns

989
05:07:14,180 --> 05:07:22,900
are impenetrable a husk of the trees being that spurns all that exists without the only way to

990
05:07:22,900 --> 05:07:30,549
stand before the Elden ring. I'm telling you right now, the Elden Lord is having trouble with this

991
05:07:30,549 --> 05:07:42,389
game. I'll get the mimic. So I'd like you to undertake a new journey with me to the flame of

992
05:07:42,389 --> 05:07:53,689
ruin far above the cloud upon the snowy mountain tops of the giants. Then I can set the tree a

993
05:07:53,689 --> 05:08:00,150
flame. Burn the urd tree down the path. I don't trust a word. I don't trust anything this lady's

994
05:08:00,150 --> 05:08:17,529
saying. A red mark was made on the map. Okay. So now we're going to do 50 intelligence.

995
05:08:20,279 --> 05:08:36,069
That's what I want. Oh, where is it on the map? I'm curious. So it is another area. All right.

996
05:08:36,069 --> 05:08:41,450
That's it. That's it. I'm going to bed. But honest to God, if you're having a lot of trouble with

997
05:08:41,450 --> 05:08:46,389
this game and you're like, dude, I can't fucking do it. I just can't do it. If you're been,

998
05:08:46,389 --> 05:08:50,950
if you've been hitting your head against a wall, just going, I keep losing this guy 100 times. I

999
05:08:50,950 --> 05:08:57,259
actually can't play the game. I actually can't do it. That mimic really made that fight very,

1000
05:08:57,259 --> 05:09:03,459
very manageable and not, I wouldn't say the word is like the words, not easy, but like manageable.

1001
05:09:06,709 --> 05:09:10,950
I am going to try to beat most of the encounters in this game without that because I feel like that

1002
05:09:10,950 --> 05:09:19,110
was, uh, I did not think it was going to do that much damage. I really did not think that was going

1003
05:09:19,110 --> 05:09:28,419
to be that ridiculous. That's the first time I've used that item. I leveled it up like five or six

1004
05:09:28,419 --> 05:09:34,840
times or seven times. Maybe I, that's the first time I've used it as a boss and just watched him

1005
05:09:34,840 --> 05:09:44,869
kill the boss. That was ridiculous. Mimic is really OP. It makes every single boss that easy. Really

1006
05:09:44,869 --> 05:09:49,830
damn. But I mean, but seriously though, like if you, if you're having like a lot of trouble

1007
05:09:51,430 --> 05:09:54,709
and you just kind of, you really want to be able to progress and you really want to go level up,

1008
05:09:54,709 --> 05:10:01,900
go get the mimic, that'll help you. They will. Um, I probably won't be using it for the remainder

1009
05:10:01,900 --> 05:10:07,400
of the time that I play the game. Not that I, not that I'm looking down on it or anything. I just,

1010
05:10:07,400 --> 05:10:15,139
I, I thought I, I almost beat that guy first try. Uh, so I'm only going to use it if I really need

1011
05:10:15,139 --> 05:10:25,979
it. Really, really, really need it. Not every boss. Some are fucking insane. Yeah. Again,

1012
05:10:25,979 --> 05:10:32,060
I'm not looking down on using the item. I, uh, if I can do it without it, I'm going to try to do it

1013
05:10:32,060 --> 05:10:46,599
without it. You'll be using it on commander Neil. Okay. Well, good to know. Uh, all right. Same with

1014
05:10:46,599 --> 05:10:52,599
the Katana. No, I mean, like everything is viable. You don't, you don't, don't let anybody tell you,

1015
05:10:52,599 --> 05:10:56,680
you can't use a certain item. If you, if you haven't fun and you're playing through the game,

1016
05:10:56,680 --> 05:11:02,279
then use it. There's no reason not to, right? Uh, I think the most fun I've had in the game so far,

1017
05:11:02,279 --> 05:11:07,740
I think I can give this an assessment, a real review, like of sorts. The most fun I've had in

1018
05:11:07,740 --> 05:11:15,180
the game has not been at the boss fights, like the main story fights. It's been exploring the world.

1019
05:11:15,180 --> 05:11:19,580
It's been finding a dungeon. It's been getting killed somewhere in a spot that you're like,

1020
05:11:19,580 --> 05:11:26,060
holy shit, where even am I? I love the areas. I love the actual huge open world as hard as it is

1021
05:11:26,060 --> 05:11:32,099
and as crazy as it's been, right? Um, I actually liked that more than the actual boss fights.

1022
05:11:32,099 --> 05:11:36,520
So, but yeah, I'm going to try to beat step on my own. I'm going to try to beat it without

1023
05:11:36,520 --> 05:11:45,830
using too many of the, uh, powerful summons or anything. We'll see if I can do it. But yeah,

1024
05:11:46,389 --> 05:11:52,540
that was ridiculous. I'm glad I at least got to kill it and I will see you guys. The next stream

1025
05:11:52,540 --> 05:11:58,840
is going to be, well, interestingly enough, uh, it will be Saturday, although I will not be

1026
05:11:58,840 --> 05:12:04,619
streaming. I am going to be at the streamer awards. So you're probably going to see me.

1027
05:12:04,619 --> 05:12:09,080
I'm going to be presenting one of the awards. Hopefully I look okay in a suit. Hopefully I

1028
05:12:09,080 --> 05:12:17,049
look all right. Uh, uh, it's going to be fun. Looking forward to it. Jano's nominated for two

1029
05:12:17,049 --> 05:12:24,520
awards. We'll see what happens. I mean, I, that'd be cool, but there's tons of great nominees. So

1030
05:12:24,520 --> 05:12:29,450
it's, it's very, very competitive from what I would, uh, what I would assume.

1031
05:12:29,450 --> 05:12:43,500
Very good nominees. You're handsome. Hey, yeah, I'm going to do all the side stuff too,

1032
05:12:43,500 --> 05:12:50,740
or at least a lot of it. So I will be back on my channel on the 14th or the 15th. Even I and the

1033
05:12:50,740 --> 05:12:56,889
sus either that Monday or Tuesday trying to figure out when I will actually be around the stream.

1034
05:12:56,889 --> 05:13:09,000
Sorry for turning out purple, although that was probably very funny. I hope you got a laugh.

1035
05:13:09,000 --> 05:13:17,700
Don't growl again. I won't. I promise. All right. I, uh, I'm going to let the credits play out.

1036
05:13:17,700 --> 05:13:21,500
Oh, that's right. I put that in there. I'm going to save the game. I'm going to be right here.

1037
05:13:21,500 --> 05:13:25,740
Thanks so much for watching guys. This was a long one. I planned for it to be long cause I knew that

1038
05:13:25,740 --> 05:13:29,930
I wasn't going to be around for like six days probably. And I've been trying to stream this

1039
05:13:29,930 --> 05:13:35,799
game a lot cause I think it's great. I think it's amazing, but I will see you guys later.

1040
05:13:35,799 --> 05:13:39,080
If you're going to watch streamer awards, go ahead and watch it. It'll be on cutie Cinderella's

1041
05:13:39,080 --> 05:13:45,720
channel. I have a fantastic evening, of course, rest of your night. I'm going to get some sleep.

1042
05:13:45,720 --> 05:13:53,700
I got a lot to do tomorrow. Yeah. And I'm going to let this play out.

1043
05:14:04,500 --> 05:14:13,639
I didn't mean for that to play us out, but it did. Is this the longest stream? No,

1044
05:14:13,639 --> 05:14:33,450
my longest stream. I think was 14 hours is Lord of the rings. Uh, the two towers

1045
05:14:33,450 --> 05:14:34,810
mauled of the rings.

1046
05:14:43,830 --> 05:14:55,799
Simpsons was close. Simpsons. I think was 12, 12 and a half, 13. All right. I'll see you guys later.

1047
05:14:55,799 --> 05:15:00,009
Thanks for all the subs everybody. I haven't really been paying too much attention to anything

1048
05:15:00,009 --> 05:15:11,479
that's coming through a brain's been focused pretty much the whole time. So what is,

1049
05:15:11,479 --> 05:15:18,580
let me ask you this. Those of you that has to finish the game, what remains if, okay,

1050
05:15:18,580 --> 05:15:24,020
let's say I were to walk down the main story campaign hallway and you just go down the main

1051
05:15:24,020 --> 05:15:39,049
story campaign, how much is left? What'd you say? I'll be around somewhere on 80% done. Okay.

1052
05:15:39,049 --> 05:15:45,479
Maybe like two or three streams. There's a, there's another map. There's another. Yeah.

1053
05:15:47,860 --> 05:15:58,630
God, this game is so big. I'll be about 15 to 20 hours. Okay. So I'll do it. I'll come. I'll

1054
05:15:58,630 --> 05:16:13,689
finish it on stream. At least I'll try to still about the still four main bosses remaining.

1055
05:16:13,689 --> 05:16:26,569
