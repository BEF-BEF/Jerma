00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:13,300
Hello. Hi everybody. I'm just realizing right now that this, for some reason, why is this not working?

2
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:28,660
My Monster Rancher 4 disc is for some reason not reading now. That's weird. Hold on.

3
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,659
Let's hope that doesn't cause a problem, otherwise we're gonna have to do something else. That's not good.

4
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:38,229
It was working before. Let's see.

5
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:42,229
Hello. Let's watch with me here. Let's see what happens.

6
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:49,460
But, hope you had a good couple of days. There it is. Okay.

7
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:59,399
But, here we are. Alright. Okay. That was weird.

8
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,400
Monster Rancher 4 tonight. We played Monster Rancher 3. It wasn't that good.

9
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:13,969
And there's apparently an animated intro to this game.

10
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:23,030
Don't ask me why this is here, but okay.

11
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:28,870
Didn't they make a TV show on this game? They made like a whole television franchise.

12
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:38,340
Is this just a giant ad for the show?

13
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:45,719
It started as a TV show. What? How come there's no audio?

14
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:55,450
Oh god, you're playing the bad one. The last one was the bad one.

15
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:01,799
I thought EVO was the bad one. Is there only one good one?

16
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:13,930
I was told that EVO was the bad one, 3 was the bad one, 4 is apparently the bad one.

17
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:21,669
Oh, that's Captain Hook Sonic! Am I gonna get flags for this?

18
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:35,300
I hope not. No, I'm not. This is just a simple introduction.

19
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,080
This is the intro of the stream.

20
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,240
Alright, but while you watch this, I'm gonna tweet this stream.

21
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,379
I can't even do that with this lingering cough.

22
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:58,270
I've made this noise before. I've made this song before, probably.

23
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:07,849
Hey, that's Monster Rancher 4. 2003.

24
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:17,460
Why does it look so JPGE? That's because it's old and it's being pulled through a device.

25
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:24,210
But, this is what we're gonna try to do today.

26
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:33,719
And I did say that if the game is terrible, I do have a solution.

27
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:36,900
Okay, that's tweeted.

28
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,539
I have a solution for if this game is very bad.

29
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:46,539
Am I emulating? No, I am not. This is real hardware. I'm a real hardware streamer.

30
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:55,789
New game versus mode option. Let's see what's in here.

31
00:03:55,789 --> 00:04:00,930
Alright, come on. Can we listen to some of the sounds?

32
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,930
No.

33
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:09,729
75. Don't ever have background music the same.

34
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:20,199
If the game is bad, Google Feud. No, if the game is bad, we're going to Mr. Mosquito.

35
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:27,620
And that was hard to track down.

36
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,189
Monster Rancher 4. Here we go.

37
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:35,189
A long time ago, people and monsters lived in harmony.

38
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:42,029
But eventually, humans sealed the monsters inside tablets called saucer stones.

39
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:44,339
This is the intro to Undertale.

40
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,100
Those are discs, if you don't know. And I got plenty of them here.

41
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,100
The people are entertained by monster battles and the breeders who raise the monsters are heroes.

42
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,540
Weird.

43
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,540
The capital of the country is Toggle, a place far from Ruin.

44
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,540
That's the name of my town.

45
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:22,319
A boat from Age Island brought you here.

46
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,069
And that's how it all started.

47
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:30,110
And then she got snapped.

48
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:37,550
Get your butt out of here, you sneaky little rat.

49
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,300
This is TT.

50
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,310
Yowchoo, what are you doing? What did I do wrong?

51
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,129
Why, you have some nerve.

52
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:51,519
Sneaking in and sleeping in a stranger's bed.

53
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:57,410
Don't you play innocent with me.

54
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,079
Uh, what the fuck?

55
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:05,500
I didn't come into this stuffy room because I wanted to.

56
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,310
Huh? Boy, you really do have a lot of nerve.

57
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,310
What the fuck is happening here?

58
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,740
Excuse me, you two.

59
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,050
Huh? Well, what is it?

60
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,220
My name is Caesar and I'm from a nearby shrine.

61
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,220
If it's okay, I'd like to take care of that boy.

62
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:26,769
Huh, you're a big wig in this town. Well, good timing.

63
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:29,329
This brat broke into here.

64
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:31,329
He needs to be thrown into jail, I tell ya.

65
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:34,339
I trust you'll take care of this.

66
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:37,860
Oh, boy, and off she goes.

67
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,860
That young girl doesn't have a sharp tongue.

68
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,990
Yeah, I bet she scares all the boys away.

69
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,990
Well, good night, mister.

70
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,060
Zzz, I fell asleep immediately.

71
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,160
God, to have that power.

72
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,740
Sometimes I sit in bed and try to sleep for like four straight hours.

73
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,740
You know what superpowers people talk about they wish they had?

74
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,050
If you had a superpower, what would it be?

75
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,350
I would fly.

76
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,420
No, fuck that.

77
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,920
I think it would be fun to be invisible.

78
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,920
No, that's stupid.

79
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,529
I'd like to be able to fall asleep whenever I wanted to and go into REM sleep.

80
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:21,350
Now that's a good superpower.

81
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,350
Oh, boy, they're so already asleep, huh?

82
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,420
What's this? The boy's bag.

83
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,329
Looks rifled through it.

84
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:32,329
What an odd intro. Is this anime like this?

85
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:34,329
Are these characters from the TV show?

86
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,459
Hmm. Where am I?

87
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:39,459
What? My bag. The saucer stones.

88
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,709
Eek.

89
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:44,709
Sorry, have you seen my bag?

90
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:46,709
So he... I don't understand

91
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:48,709
what happened in the first five minutes of this game.

92
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:53,379
He broke into somebody's house,

93
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:55,379
fell asleep instantly,

94
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:58,779
and then an old person stole his bag.

95
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,779
I don't know what's going on.

96
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:03,399
Hmm, err, your bag.

97
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,399
Don't be alarmed, your bag and the saucer stones

98
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:07,699
are right here.

99
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:09,699
Did you know this girl worried about you

100
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:12,199
and stayed by your side this whole time?

101
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,949
Maybe a thanks is in order.

102
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:16,949
This girl, Rio, she's my daughter.

103
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:21,050
She did that for me? Thanks, Rio.

104
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,810
Oh, sure.

105
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,810
If I may ask, does this bag mean

106
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,819
that you're a student at Elvis School?

107
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:31,819
The elite school that trains top breeders?

108
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:33,820
To move their hips back and forth

109
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,820
real fast?

110
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,820
No, I used to be a student, but I was expelled.

111
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,940
I hate this.

112
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,940
This is fucking stupid.

113
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,940
What did you get expelled for?

114
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,279
No.

115
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:54,279
General lied about Minecraft VR thanks to the five community subs.

116
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:58,679
Thank you.

117
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,679
I see. You couldn't face your parents,

118
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,679
so you snuck onto the ship.

119
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:05,750
I can't say that I approve of that, lad.

120
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,500
No, I don't have any parents.

121
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,500
I had nowhere to go, and I just didn't know

122
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,700
what to do, so I came here.

123
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,700
What do you mean you don't have any?

124
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,309
What? Like, does he mean ever?

125
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:24,409
Kazzie, thanks for the five community subs.

126
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:30,809
Oh, yeah,

127
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:34,070
he's got his parents.

128
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:39,690
You have to watch

129
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,690
this show for one anime a year.

130
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,690
No, I don't think

131
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,690
I'm going to do that, but thank you Kazzie,

132
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,690
and thank you Peek-A-Banana for five community subs.

133
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,690
Fifteen community subs right off the bat here. Thank you, guys.

134
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,059
I can't help what happened.

135
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,059
To be honest, I hardly care about being

136
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:57,620
expelled anymore.

137
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,620
I see. Sorry if I mentioned

138
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,929
parents at all.

139
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:03,929
What is going on here? General lied about Minecraft VR.

140
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:06,230
Five more community subs.

141
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,879
Damn. Thank you, guys.

142
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:12,629
That's twenty now. Back to back.

143
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:19,159
Holy Jesus. Thank you, guys.

144
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:21,980
I'm sorry I mentioned parents at all.

145
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,789
I have an idea. Why don't you work here?

146
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:26,789
I'm looking for somebody to look after some

147
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:29,740
vacant land. You're not doing

148
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,740
any good just hanging around, so how about it?

149
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,740
You could even raise some monsters.

150
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,299
Raise monsters?

151
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:38,299
You mean you'd let me run a ranch?

152
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:40,789
You just met me and you'd let me do that?

153
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:43,799
Well, nothing big time,

154
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:46,360
but a ranch nonetheless.

155
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,360
Now I don't know what you did to get expelled,

156
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,360
but I'm sure you had your reasons.

157
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,690
This guy's messed up.

158
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,759
What do you know what he did?

159
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:58,759
You had your reasons to get expelled from school.

160
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:02,600
But there's no point in giving up your dream now.

161
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,899
So what it'll be.

162
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:07,779
Let's see. What's your name?

163
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:14,279
Fane.

164
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:19,529
That is too many

165
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:24,139
ways. That's too much.

166
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:26,440
Fane. I don't think I want to change that.

167
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,509
That seems pretty canon to me.

168
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:32,649
Fane? P-H-A-Y-N-E.

169
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:37,059
That's canon.

170
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:50,100
I can't change it. Yeah.

171
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,100
Fane. My name is Fane.

172
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,100
This is just like a live journal username.

173
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,779
Thank you Magellan for the

174
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:04,659
five community subs. Thank you guys.

175
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:07,100
Of course. I accept.

176
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,590
Thanks Mr. Caesar.

177
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,590
Now let's settle then. You can use this

178
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,590
saucer stone to regenerate monsters.

179
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,590
Okay, let's head to the shrine.

180
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,220
First monster. Here we go.

181
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,059
You can regenerate saucer stones in this

182
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:24,059
shrine. Is this your first visit to a

183
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:26,870
real shrine, Fane?

184
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,870
This time we'll regenerate from this saucer stone.

185
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,870
But if you find any others, bring them over.

186
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:34,970
As long as you have room to raise

187
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,970
more monsters, you can regenerate them

188
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,980
any time you like. Why do you have

189
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:44,009
red eyes? This is the adult

190
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:47,659
version of Annabelle.

191
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:49,659
This is like Annabelle grew up

192
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:51,659
to like a late teenager.

193
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:57,720
We're in the same clothes. Is this

194
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:09,820
the same character? Yeah.

195
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:15,500
It is. It's just

196
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
a little bit different color scheme.

197
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,990
As long as you have room to raise more monsters,

198
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,990
you can generate them. Yeah.

199
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,230
Now Fane, let the regeneration

200
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:28,139
begin. So I get one for free

201
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:30,500
or do I have to put a disk in? So those

202
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,500
of you that have no idea what's going on in the game, let me try

203
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,500
to explain.

204
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,320
This is a game where you battle monsters.

205
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,320
And you get the monsters by

206
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,320
putting in any disk you have in your

207
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,320
house. And it generates a random

208
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,320
seed for that disk.

209
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:52,019
And you get a monster. So this

210
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:54,019
is your first monster. Okay, let's have you give it a

211
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:56,330
name. That's the first

212
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,330
monster?

213
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:01,210
I don't want this like default

214
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,210
dickhead. I want my own.

215
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:09,210
It's just like, that's like

216
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,210
what a mouse design would look like

217
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,210
if it was a Disney Pixar movie.

218
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,090
Isn't there already like a Disney Pixar

219
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:22,629
like rat mouse?

220
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,629
It's like, I don't know. How about

221
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:26,629
Mawaz?

222
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:36,700
That's a wonderful

223
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,700
name. Give it all your love

224
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,830
to Mawaz. Now,

225
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,830
take Fane to that empty plot of land.

226
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:56,169
I want that thing. What do I get like

227
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:58,169
the baby King Dedede from?

228
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:06,019
We're here. Wow, it's huge and

229
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:08,710
so mysterious. This is just

230
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,529
awesome, huh Rio? Wait,

231
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:13,529
I hear a voice from over there. Who could it be?

232
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:16,659
Shoot, wait up, wait up, I tell ya.

233
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,620
Finally. I got

234
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,620
up. Are you the boy named Fane?

235
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,460
Yes, who are you?

236
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,340
My name is Yuri.

237
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,860
Caesar told me to come and help you.

238
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,809
I work at the item shop, but

239
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:40,809
I always wanted to try being a ranch assistant.

240
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:43,940
So I look forward to working with you,

241
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,940
Fane. Let's do some good work together.

242
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,440
Sure, Yuri, let's

243
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,809
uh, it's time

244
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:54,259
for me to go home. Hey Rio, she's

245
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:56,820
gone. Anyway, let's do some good

246
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,820
work. I might not look it, but I've done my

247
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,340
homework. You can count on me.

248
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:07,590
Okay, first, let's go over the ranch basics.

249
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,789
Clean out your ears

250
00:16:10,789 --> 00:16:13,740
and listen up carefully. At the beginning

251
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,740
of the week, you create a schedule.

252
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,679
Oh no, I'm not very

253
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:20,679
good with those. Schedule training

254
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,679
to strengthen your monster. Can I have no schedule?

255
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:24,679
I work way better on no schedule.

256
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:29,159
And schedule breaks to let your monster

257
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:31,980
rest. You can schedule up to

258
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,980
eight weeks in advance. Use

259
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,980
this to create a long term plan.

260
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,860
I'm going on like a diet,

261
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,860
apparently. Okay, so then select

262
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,860
the training type and time,

263
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,860
then free time to play with your monster.

264
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,059
By playing with the monster here, the monsters

265
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:50,059
bond with you will strengthen.

266
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:53,580
We're playing like busy dad simulator.

267
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,940
I gotta ride in an hour

268
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,940
to throw the ball around with my son.

269
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,379
Praise monsters when they do a good job

270
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:02,379
to further strengthen your mutual bond.

271
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:05,579
And if a monster is not doing what it should,

272
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:08,390
then it's time for a discipline.

273
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,170
Lazy monsters must be brought into

274
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,339
line. Love is both carrot

275
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,339
and stick, and this also increases

276
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,779
bonding. Use your best judgment

277
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:20,779
and take advantage of free time as an

278
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:22,779
opportunity to raise the level of bonding.

279
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:25,779
Lastly, rest on weekends until you get used

280
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:28,019
to things. Later you can enter

281
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:30,019
competition and shop in town.

282
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:32,650
Well, that's a typical week on the ranch. The rest

283
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,980
you'll learn as you go. Well, what do you think?

284
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,980
Did you understand? Yeah, you schedule

285
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,049
out everything. You schedule rest,

286
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:43,049
schedule training, schedule playtime.

287
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:46,059
I think I get it. Kind of.

288
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:49,750
Maybe, probably not though. Good, you're a great partner.

289
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:55,450
Well, let's give it our best then.

290
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,450
Year one, month four,

291
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,450
week one, schedule.

292
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,450
Alright, so we got data, command,

293
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,450
training, schedule, shrine, system,

294
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,940
mows is very lively.

295
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,509
Let's go to schedule. So this is

296
00:18:09,509 --> 00:18:11,690
year, this is one, this is the first

297
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,059
week. So week, we're gonna do

298
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:18,410
training. Uh, I need to see,

299
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,410
wait, what are you, the monster plans its own training

300
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:23,099
to raise strength. No, no, no, go back.

301
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:26,230
What, what does this guy even have his stats?

302
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:31,029
How do I see his stats? Data.

303
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:35,369
Monster, okay. So, power,

304
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:38,809
life, high power.

305
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:43,420
Uh, for one second, I don't know, my brain

306
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,420
just didn't understand. I thought that said

307
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,660
Oyoromo. I was like,

308
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,660
what's that, what name is that? I didn't

309
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,500
give him the name Oyoromo. Yeah,

310
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,740
pretty dumb, but it looks like,

311
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,490
what do you got for moves? Skills. Hmm.

312
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:02,259
So this is wild slash.

313
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:05,910
This is a power move. This is an

314
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,910
intelligence move for somebody with 85 intelligence.

315
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,920
Sounds pretty terrible. And then fire

316
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:16,859
charge. Okay. So

317
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:19,099
I think we're gonna work on power. And

318
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:21,099
what, this is also power, right?

319
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:24,740
Yeah, power. I can barely

320
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,740
read those numbers.

321
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:31,539
Yeah, they're a little crusty, aren't they?

322
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:33,539
Let's go to the shrine. Let's do the thing that we're supposed

323
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,869
to be doing, first of all. I don't know if I like

324
00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:41,220
this guy. Well, hello, everything going well.

325
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,339
So what will it be? Okay.

326
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:46,970
Let's create. You already

327
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,970
have a monster you're, you already have a monster

328
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:52,470
you're raising. So what will it be?

329
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,630
Uh, do I have to, like, freeze him? Come again

330
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,900
anytime. I don't know if it was like the other games.

331
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,799
Put in, I got, oh, I got lots of stuff here,

332
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:07,450
don't worry. Uh, so,

333
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:11,859
how do I freeze him? Shrine system?

334
00:20:11,859 --> 00:20:19,859
Holy shit, that actually is fireman.

335
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:25,559
Like, I could, I should have named it fireman.

336
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:32,470
It sort of is, with the big groucho

337
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,470
marks eyebrows. Alright, so how do I, um,

338
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,349
how do I do that?

339
00:20:37,349 --> 00:20:48,089
Appraise? Maybe he can, like,

340
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:50,710
just a moment, feign. You don't have a saucer stone.

341
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,779
There's nothing to appraise without a saucer

342
00:20:53,779 --> 00:20:58,460
stone. It's too late to kill

343
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,759
it. I'm not trying to kill it, I'm just

344
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:08,180
trying to store it.

345
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,180
Walmart brand

346
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,180
salamander.

347
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,180
Walmart brand charmander.

348
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:20,200
Alright, I don't, I don't think

349
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,549
I can fucking freeze him.

350
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,549
Schedule. Could I, like, schedule him to be put on

351
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:33,910
ice? System.

352
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,910
Save. Versus

353
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,920
data? Let's just save the game.

354
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,910
Schedule him to die.

355
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:52,230
Release him

356
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,230
into the wild. He's like a baby.

357
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,180
Alright, I think, I don't think I can do this

358
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,180
yet. I think we just have to play with, um, I don't even

359
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,180
know his name, mouse. Let's log,

360
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,420
okay, schedule. Training.

361
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,420
We're gonna do

362
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,420
power training, this is exercise,

363
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,099
and then let's

364
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:13,099
do a little bit of more

365
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:15,099
training the next day.

366
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:17,099
And then we're gonna rest, and then we're

367
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:19,779
gonna do rest, and then

368
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:23,299
what about, like, how do I do a play

369
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:27,460
date? No, not all training.

370
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:32,839
He's gonna die.

371
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:36,549
Automatic.

372
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:39,500
Maybe his exercise

373
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,500
high jump. Balance.

374
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,500
Let's do balance.

375
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,500
Okay.

376
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,500
So now, let's go back.

377
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,799
And just, let's go.

378
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,799
Let's, let's do it.

379
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:53,799
How do I, like, play out my

380
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:55,799
baseball season that I made?

381
00:22:55,799 --> 00:23:00,579
Do I have to do it all?

382
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,579
Okay, submenu.

383
00:23:02,579 --> 00:23:08,789
I guess we have to block this all out. Alright,

384
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:10,789
balance, that will rest, and we'll do

385
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,789
two weeks in a row. Of power.

386
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:17,339
And then rest again.

387
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:19,339
Okay. Let's go.

388
00:23:19,339 --> 00:23:26,569
Command.

389
00:23:26,569 --> 00:23:29,690
I command you to do something.

390
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:32,309
Begin the training. I guess.

391
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:36,539
Alright, so power.

392
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:44,069
Plus six.

393
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:46,069
What is he doing? He's just doing sit-ups

394
00:23:46,069 --> 00:23:53,180
in front of the house. Free

395
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,819
time. I can actually walk

396
00:23:56,819 --> 00:24:08,329
around?

397
00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:10,329
Command.

398
00:24:10,329 --> 00:24:13,910
Weekend. Book, belongings,

399
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,910
what do I do with them? Praise.

400
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,220
Okay. I'm assuming the, what's the

401
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:31,910
second button? I'm not gonna skull

402
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,920
them, he didn't do anything wrong.

403
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,920
Alright, let's see. Command. Schedule. What about

404
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,920
data? Breeder, belongings.

405
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,920
Okay, so circle is how you get to, like, your

406
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,920
inventory. Proceed to weekend

407
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,380
activities. Not yet. Hold on.

408
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,000
Schedule. Exercise.

409
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,460
Exercise. No. Alright, it just plays

410
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:58,730
out, no matter what you do. Cannot

411
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,730
do anymore. I cannot praise him again.

412
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:05,380
Alright, well how do I play with him?

413
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:09,740
There's no play? Does he do anything else

414
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:13,640
besides sit-ups? Alright, well let's just move

415
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,029
on. Proceed to the weekend activities.

416
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:21,900
Yes. Town.

417
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,900
Go to town next week. Do nothing

418
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,900
and proceed directly to the next week. What do you mean

419
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,799
go to town?

420
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:31,799
Hometown. The shrine overlooks the association

421
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,799
and other shops and port.

422
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:37,130
Let's go to town together.

423
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:46,220
Dude, that's like a triple

424
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,460
room right there.

425
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,460
These motherfuckers, I swear to God.

426
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:57,220
Alright, so let's try.

427
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,299
Well, hello, everything going well?

428
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:02,299
What'll it be?

429
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:05,930
I guess.

430
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:10,470
I don't think I got, I haven't unlocked

431
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,470
anything else besides the first town

432
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:18,869
in Chrono Trigger.

433
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:27,579
There's nothing I can do. Well, that was fun.

434
00:26:27,579 --> 00:26:30,519
April, week two in spring.

435
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:32,519
Hello, I heard that you're going to start

436
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:34,519
a new monster ranch in this area.

437
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:36,519
My name is Cynthia. I do

438
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:38,519
registration for the Toggle Monster Association.

439
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:40,890
Nice to meet you. The association oversees

440
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,890
the various ranches. I'm in charge of Toggle.

441
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:45,130
First, register the

442
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,130
name of your ranch at the association.

443
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,430
Okay. Here's how you do it. First,

444
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,430
select a symbol for your ranch, then select

445
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,930
a name. The name of your ranch becomes

446
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,930
permanent, so make sure you think of a good one.

447
00:26:55,930 --> 00:27:00,599
Wait,

448
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:02,599
it's predictive text.

449
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:04,599
Farm the...

450
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:07,029
Is it, wait.

451
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:10,809
Farm street? The...

452
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:12,809
No, no, no, no, no, no. What?

453
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:16,200
The park. Farm park.

454
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,759
Ranch school. I don't know what

455
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:20,759
this is trying to get me to do.

456
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:22,759
Club great.

457
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:24,759
Club new. Team

458
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:27,700
the.

459
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:34,490
Street cape.

460
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,490
How about club cape?

461
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:39,819
The club.

462
00:27:39,819 --> 00:27:41,819
New team.

463
00:27:41,819 --> 00:27:46,299
Ranch school.

464
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:49,369
I kind of like ranch school. How about

465
00:27:49,369 --> 00:27:51,369
ranch yard?

466
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,670
Ranchdom?

467
00:27:53,670 --> 00:28:08,250
Ranchdom.

468
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,250
Dom club.

469
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,809
Dom land.

470
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:15,940
Club

471
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,180
ranch.

472
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,619
I don't know. These are all too good.

473
00:28:20,619 --> 00:28:22,619
Farm street is also really good too.

474
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:25,559
New

475
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:27,559
street. Oh, I'm gonna have to just close

476
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:34,660
my eyes.

477
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,660
Ranch club. Ranch town.

478
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,660
Ranch cape. Land school.

479
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,890
Land school.

480
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:51,990
What? No, no.

481
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:55,130
I want it to be land school.

482
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,130
It's permanent. I can't change this.

483
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:01,140
There is no going back.

484
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:11,700
Actually isn't.

485
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,700
This is such shit. This is the worst.

486
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:23,500
It has to be this.

487
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,799
School land.

488
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,799
Do your best.

489
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,799
I'm rooting for you.

490
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:31,799
That's fucking terrible.

491
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:41,660
Such a dumbass.

492
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,150
Look.

493
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,150
School land is good for me.

494
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,150
That would be a terrible Disney park.

495
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:50,150
I can't restart. She told me.

496
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:52,900
No restart.

497
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,900
He was expelled from school.

498
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,900
So he made his own school

499
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,900
land.

500
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,900
That's fucking funny.

501
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:05,190
Alright, let's go.

502
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:11,720
You guys are killing me.

503
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,220
Is that level 10?

504
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,220
I'm at 88% success rate.

505
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,220
88%. 9 power. That's pretty good.

506
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:29,589
I don't know

507
00:30:29,589 --> 00:30:32,150
what these bars even mean.

508
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,150
The top bar is not even a bar.

509
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:36,150
It's a series of flags.

510
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:39,160
It's a series of

511
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,160
symbols that point to the left.

512
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,160
I don't know what that's supposed to mean.

513
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,160
The middle one is down arrow

514
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,700
with bar. And then the last one

515
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,700
I don't know. That's somebody making a

516
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,700
shadow on the wall with their hands.

517
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,700
With a light in front of it. Like a hand

518
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,700
puppet. I don't know what that means.

519
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:06,470
But good job.

520
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:12,619
You got almost 10 points.

521
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:14,619
If only there was a word for a symbol that

522
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:17,299
points in a direction.

523
00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:19,299
Left. But why is that

524
00:31:19,299 --> 00:31:21,299
what does left have to do with

525
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:27,640
this? Alright, let's fight.

526
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,160
No, not me and you, but like let's

527
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,160
let's see. How good are you doing now?

528
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,160
200 points? That's actually pretty good.

529
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,109
Okay, there it is.

530
00:31:39,109 --> 00:31:41,109
Alright guys, if I didn't go to this menu

531
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:43,109
you can't tell me that you would think.

532
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,109
Focus, tired, and

533
00:31:45,109 --> 00:31:49,589
fullness. That's focus

534
00:31:49,589 --> 00:31:54,329
not left. Alright.

535
00:31:54,329 --> 00:32:00,839
Let's just keep going.

536
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:04,549
Proceed to the weekend activities.

537
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:06,549
We can't do anything in town so let's just go.

538
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:12,630
Third week. When are we going to get a

539
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,940
tournament? Keeping up the good

540
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,940
work, Fane. I brought

541
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,940
some treats today. Here, give these snacks

542
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,750
to the monsters.

543
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,759
Plural, I don't have more than one.

544
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:26,759
On a ranch, you've got to train your monsters

545
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:28,759
but you've got to look after their health too.

546
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:31,450
Focus, fatigue, fullness,

547
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,450
status. You can check all these stats.

548
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:36,069
On the lower right gauge

549
00:32:36,069 --> 00:32:38,309
during scheduling. During

550
00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:40,309
free time, talk to your monsters plenty

551
00:32:40,309 --> 00:32:42,309
and care for them as appropriate to their status.

552
00:32:42,309 --> 00:32:44,549
And you know, breeder

553
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:46,549
rank and ranch status affect the number of

554
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:48,549
actions you can execute during free time.

555
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,980
You notice the small sphere

556
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,980
on the lower left during free time. That's the

557
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,980
number of actions you can do. Okay, good to know.

558
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,799
Now, there's one sphere

559
00:32:57,799 --> 00:32:59,799
so I can do one

560
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:03,319
thing. Now, don't you forget

561
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:05,319
to feed your monsters. Well, do your best,

562
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:08,900
Fane. You received

563
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,140
two potatoes. Thanks

564
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,509
for the help. And two mangoes.

565
00:33:13,509 --> 00:33:16,650
And a squid.

566
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:25,720
And a beef.

567
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:34,230
This week's HelloFresh came in.

568
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:37,819
Boy, man. Okay, so

569
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:39,819
it's raining. What do you got? Focus.

570
00:33:39,819 --> 00:33:41,990
You're pretty focused. Tired.

571
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:45,700
Sorry.

572
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,500
This one was balance, right?

573
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,500
No, this is rest. Okay, this is rest.

574
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:57,240
Now, can I feed you from here?

575
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:05,109
Probably. Okay.

576
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:07,480
Food. What do you like?

577
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,510
Squid? I wonder what kind of

578
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,510
food you like.

579
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,329
Mango? Squid?

580
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:18,329
Most monsters eat it raw.

581
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:20,630
A big hunk of beef still on

582
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,630
the bone. It satisfies your monsters wild

583
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:31,960
side. Squid.

584
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,820
Disgusting. Pretty nice

585
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,820
triple Mario jump.

586
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:42,090
Yes, I'll make a Mario reference. I don't care.

587
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:46,809
Now he's dead.

588
00:34:46,809 --> 00:34:48,809
Oh, don't ever eat undercooked squid.

589
00:34:48,809 --> 00:34:52,260
Or you die.

590
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:56,360
Alright, let's go to the weekend.

591
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,360
How do I? I want another monster.

592
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,619
When am I going to get

593
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:03,619
to my stone?

594
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:06,380
I've got all kinds of weird shit to put in

595
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,380
here. I have a game that

596
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,380
I didn't get to play, that I was so

597
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,380
looking forward to, and I'm going to use it for today's.

598
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,739
Right? I bought a game

599
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:16,739
that I thought was going to be hilariously fun

600
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:19,300
for PC, and it just doesn't work.

601
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,610
Yawn. Up and at him.

602
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:24,679
Yeah. Hmm. A visitor.

603
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:28,840
Hee hee. Is that right?

604
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,719
I'm so glad you met such a

605
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:33,719
fun person, mouse.

606
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:36,789
Hey, Rio!

607
00:35:36,789 --> 00:35:38,789
Oh, there you are. Whatcha up to?

608
00:35:38,789 --> 00:35:41,349
Uh, oh, I

609
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:44,940
just dropped by.

610
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:48,519
Hey, she's gone!

611
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:50,519
Hey, Yuri! Do you think I said something wrong?

612
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:53,659
Don't worry, she's always like that.

613
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:56,150
She talks so kindly to monsters,

614
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,150
but doesn't say a word to the villagers.

615
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:01,929
She is a monster. Hmm, really?

616
00:36:01,929 --> 00:36:08,579
Okay, what's the schedule look like

617
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:10,579
this week?

618
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:12,579
Balance, rest, exercise,

619
00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:14,579
exercise, rest, exercise, exercise,

620
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:17,460
rest. Yeah.

621
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,460
That sounds pretty good. No, actually, don't fuck that.

622
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:30,730
I like that better.

623
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,730
Actually, hold on

624
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:34,730
a minute here. Hold on a minute.

625
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:37,420
I think I'd rather

626
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,420
put it on, like, you know, my streaming schedule.

627
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,420
You know what I mean?

628
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:55,289
Yeah, okay.

629
00:36:55,289 --> 00:36:59,130
That looks good. Three days on,

630
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,130
two days off, two days on,

631
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:07,780
one day off. Go for it.

632
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,780
Let's get some more life.

633
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:17,139
Plus seven life, good.

634
00:37:17,139 --> 00:37:20,280
Success rate at 90%.

635
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,179
I wonder, you know what I kinda miss?

636
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:26,179
I really do miss from the second game, when you get to see

637
00:37:26,179 --> 00:37:28,179
like the fun little cartoon of them doing it or failing

638
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,179
it or not, you know what I mean?

639
00:37:30,179 --> 00:37:34,219
This is dumb. Where's like the cool

640
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:36,219
where's like the them actually doing the technique

641
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:38,219
and try, you know what I mean?

642
00:37:38,219 --> 00:37:40,900
You're just balancing on one foot and I see a meter

643
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:45,639
go up. Uh, how you doing?

644
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:53,699
Lively. The first,

645
00:37:53,699 --> 00:37:56,199
Monster Hunter 2 really is the best game.

646
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:58,199
It's like really the only one you should play.

647
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:00,199
But, hold on, I'm gonna hold off

648
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:02,199
until we get some more monsters here.

649
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:07,190
Alright, he's not hungry, he's fine.

650
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:14,619
Just play two? Well, I need to see

651
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:16,619
what this has to offer.

652
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:19,179
I'm not gonna write it off yet.

653
00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:21,179
The moon is so bright tonight, I can't sleep.

654
00:38:21,179 --> 00:38:23,179
God, I wish I had that super power

655
00:38:23,179 --> 00:38:25,179
that Gerber985 talked about at the beginning of the stream.

656
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:27,800
When I was

657
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,800
expelled from school, I thought I lost my shot

658
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,489
at my dreams. But now

659
00:38:32,489 --> 00:38:34,489
here I am, standing in the middle of this ranch.

660
00:38:34,489 --> 00:38:36,659
Under such a beautiful moon,

661
00:38:36,659 --> 00:38:39,349
what a strange fate.

662
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:41,349
Is somebody there?

663
00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:45,699
We don't get many chances to meet these days,

664
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:48,969
do we? Well, you know,

665
00:38:48,969 --> 00:38:50,969
you're welcome to come any time

666
00:38:50,969 --> 00:38:54,489
you like. He sure

667
00:38:54,489 --> 00:38:56,489
seems like a nice boy.

668
00:38:56,489 --> 00:38:58,980
I sure wish I could meet him too.

669
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:02,230
No.

670
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,230
If you did that, you'd be in trouble.

671
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:07,050
Just like I am now.

672
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,289
I'm sorry, please

673
00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:11,289
don't cry, Rio.

674
00:39:11,289 --> 00:39:13,289
Is this a tree? Don't worry, I won't

675
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:15,289
do anything rash, okay, Rio?

676
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:19,300
Rio?

677
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,670
No, I'm sorry. Well, I've gotta go.

678
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,670
Rio, who is she talking to?

679
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:26,230
I couldn't get a good look.

680
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:42,659
There's a tree.

681
00:39:42,659 --> 00:39:45,989
It was sweet rind.

682
00:39:45,989 --> 00:39:48,230
Hey, week one, mate.

683
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,230
We have a visitor. Okay, let's get this- ow.

684
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:53,750
Let's get the game going.

685
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,750
Hello, Yuri, and Fane.

686
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:58,500
This place is turning into a very

687
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,260
nice ranch. You bet it is.

688
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,260
I wouldn't settle for anything less.

689
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,380
So what brings you here?

690
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,380
Well, I figured it's about time for you to

691
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,380
start thinking about the competition.

692
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,000
Would you like to go and take a look

693
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,619
first? Wow, yeah, of course.

694
00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:18,380
I'd love to go. You too, right?

695
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,110
Fane, I'm not doing that every time.

696
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:23,739
Yeah, sure, I'll bring Miles along.

697
00:40:23,739 --> 00:40:25,739
Are we gonna get a heart tear

698
00:40:25,739 --> 00:40:28,619
at the heartstrings here?

699
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:30,619
Are we gonna lose this monster?

700
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:33,559
This sure is exciting.

701
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:35,559
Next is the main event with the Ruin

702
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:41,750
and Breeders.

703
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,750
The rabbit class.

704
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:47,659
Ladies and gentlemen, finally presenting

705
00:40:47,659 --> 00:40:49,659
the beautiful thorned rose of Thimba.

706
00:40:49,659 --> 00:40:52,219
Miss Titi

707
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:55,159
and her Kalarino.

708
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:58,739
Why is she here?

709
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:00,980
If it isn't that kiddo, what the heck are you

710
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,289
doing here?

711
00:41:03,289 --> 00:41:05,289
You even brought a monster? Wait a minute, don't tell me

712
00:41:05,289 --> 00:41:07,980
you are a Breeder.

713
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,150
Well, well. Is that so?

714
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,949
Hmm.

715
00:41:12,949 --> 00:41:14,949
Well, I can see you've got the perfect monster

716
00:41:14,949 --> 00:41:16,949
for playing in a sandbox.

717
00:41:16,949 --> 00:41:18,949
The whole crowd fucking

718
00:41:18,949 --> 00:41:21,380
laughs. What did you say?

719
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:24,260
See, I just did that.

720
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,889
I just fucking did that laugh.

721
00:41:26,889 --> 00:41:29,380
I think syllable for syllable.

722
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:33,610
I told you guys think I'm

723
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:35,610
fucking stupid. I know these things.

724
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:38,300
At least you'll get to see my wonderful fighting

725
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,789
style. Hmm. Well, I could give you

726
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,789
my signature. At least that would make your

727
00:41:42,789 --> 00:41:46,119
trip here worthwhile.

728
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:48,809
And then I laughed. And then we fight

729
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:52,900
and we instantly beat this person.

730
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,900
Because this person actually sucks at what they do.

731
00:41:54,900 --> 00:42:02,519
What? Oh, we're not playing.

732
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:09,159
Apparently we're not playing. My internet's

733
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:13,320
dying though. Are we good?

734
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,250
Come on, man. Come on.

735
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:20,920
I'm dropping a lot of frames.

736
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,610
Are you guys seeing the frames?

737
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:25,610
It looks like I'm dropping a shitload of frames.

738
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:29,559
I think we're okay.

739
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:34,230
RIP INT

740
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:36,230
for internet, probably.

741
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:42,760
Hmm. Well,

742
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,760
we'll just let it see if it passes. Usually it does.

743
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,730
I hope so.

744
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:50,730
Oh, what is wrong with that girl? I'm getting really impatient

745
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:52,730
with her. I'm getting impatient with cocks too.

746
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:57,769
Huh? It's real.

747
00:42:57,769 --> 00:43:00,840
It looks like, is that like an emoji?

748
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,269
That looks like somebody doing an

749
00:43:03,269 --> 00:43:08,780
elaborate emoji in chat.

750
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:12,550
That has to be something. I don't know

751
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:14,550
what that would mean, but

752
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,559
it might mean something.

753
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:57,280
Association.

754
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,280
Monster Association, yes.

755
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,780
Finally. Got a 45 minute

756
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:07,219
tutorial here.

757
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,719
Here we are.

758
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:14,719
Alright. So.

759
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,719
Combine, retire,

760
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:19,019
ranch. I don't, do I

761
00:44:19,019 --> 00:44:23,179
really want to retire mouths?

762
00:44:23,179 --> 00:44:29,139
Do I? Thank you very much.

763
00:44:29,139 --> 00:44:31,949
No, shit.

764
00:44:31,949 --> 00:44:33,949
Couldn't you freeze them? You can't freeze them in this game?

765
00:44:33,949 --> 00:44:48,929
Once you retire, you

766
00:44:48,929 --> 00:44:50,929
cannot unfreeze. You can only

767
00:44:50,929 --> 00:44:53,300
combine. Oh, shit.

768
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:57,010
Oh, that's not good.

769
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:03,980
But, we need to put like

770
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,980
C-man in here. No.

771
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:12,639
See you later. I need to see

772
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:14,639
what comes out of C-man. It's important.

773
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:20,530
But don't, we can combine

774
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:25,650
retire

775
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:27,889
mouths.

776
00:45:27,889 --> 00:45:29,889
This is going to end up being a mistake.

777
00:45:29,889 --> 00:45:32,699
But, 200 power.

778
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:35,260
We'll get something better. You had

779
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:37,260
a good run of doing

780
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,260
30 fucking

781
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,260
push-ups. And like balancing

782
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:52,400
on your foot for 5 minutes.

783
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,400
Bye. This is like fucking

784
00:45:54,400 --> 00:46:03,869
kind of...

785
00:46:03,869 --> 00:46:05,869
That was really sad.

786
00:46:05,869 --> 00:46:07,869
What'll it be?

787
00:46:07,869 --> 00:46:09,869
Which method will you use to create

788
00:46:09,869 --> 00:46:11,869
a monster? From the

789
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:14,179
saucer. Alright,

790
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:16,480
you ready?

791
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,849
Well, let's turn the camera on.

792
00:46:18,849 --> 00:46:22,559
I did like a disappearing

793
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:24,559
act right there. Alright, first thing going

794
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:27,179
in. By the way, hi.

795
00:46:27,179 --> 00:46:36,340
First thing going in, as you know,

796
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:41,889
is going to be C-man. C-man is the first

797
00:46:41,889 --> 00:46:46,369
game going in. See you in a minute.

798
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:53,599
Your hair looks great.

799
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,059
Jimmy Newton Mustache.

800
00:46:57,059 --> 00:46:59,059
Single left side mustache hair.

801
00:46:59,059 --> 00:47:02,320
Alright, open the disc tray.

802
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,500
Opening disc tray, okay.

803
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,909
What are you talking about? Insert a CD

804
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,909
or DVD into the disc tray and push the X

805
00:47:10,909 --> 00:47:13,730
button. Here we go.

806
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:18,139
We are going to see what we get from C-man.

807
00:47:18,139 --> 00:47:20,139
And we'll try a few of these.

808
00:47:20,139 --> 00:47:28,449
And then press X. Checking

809
00:47:28,449 --> 00:47:35,619
disc. I'm going to laugh.

810
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:37,619
If it's a fish with a face, then we have to play with it.

811
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:42,420
Any CD will work.

812
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,420
No matter what it is, as long as it has data on the disc.

813
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:50,610
Alright, here we go.

814
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:52,610
Opening disc tray, if okay, press the X

815
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:54,610
button. I don't know what they keep saying that for.

816
00:47:54,610 --> 00:48:01,119
Alright.

817
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:08,420
Hold your breath. What

818
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,420
classic monster are we going to get out of

819
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:17,070
here? Remember when you recorded

820
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:19,070
yourself screaming and it caused a blackout?

821
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:23,360
I do. Okay.

822
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,360
Thanks for waiting. Time to create a monster.

823
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:30,480
Pull the lever.

824
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,960
The planets have to align.

825
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:47,250
What the hell is that?

826
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:51,469
An odd monster, I'd say.

827
00:48:51,469 --> 00:48:54,030
I see it's the first time

828
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:56,030
Fane has raised this monster. Let me

829
00:48:56,030 --> 00:48:58,590
add a page to your book.

830
00:48:58,590 --> 00:49:00,590
Take this monster home with you.

831
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:02,590
Um, yes.

832
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:07,519
So you're naming this monster?

833
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:10,960
Uh, it's like a

834
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,960
hippopotamus

835
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,960
rhinoceros triceratops on a wheel.

836
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,909
Yeah.

837
00:49:18,909 --> 00:49:22,670
It was

838
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:24,670
Fane. It has to be Vroomer.

839
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:29,280
Is Vroomer okay?

840
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:39,980
Uh, can you praise

841
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:44,900
my monster? Oh.

842
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,900
Let's go back to the ranch and take a look at the stats.

843
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:55,469
Does what CD, what you put in

844
00:49:55,469 --> 00:49:57,969
matter? Um,

845
00:49:57,969 --> 00:49:59,969
I think you'll get the same thing from the same

846
00:49:59,969 --> 00:50:01,969
disc. It's just a seed

847
00:50:01,969 --> 00:50:04,400
that is created from whatever

848
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,829
is on the disc.

849
00:50:06,829 --> 00:50:08,829
So, it's just, it could be

850
00:50:08,829 --> 00:50:10,829
it is random, but whatever the seed

851
00:50:10,829 --> 00:50:12,829
that comes from the data on the disc

852
00:50:12,829 --> 00:50:15,070
I believe is the same seed.

853
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:17,070
Maybe. This could be wrong.

854
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:19,070
Alright, let's go. Uh, let's take a look.

855
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:24,510
Oh, you are

856
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:27,900
terrible. Look at how bad

857
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,900
this monster is.

858
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,900
133 is the highest stat.

859
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:34,139
What do you have from moves?

860
00:50:34,139 --> 00:50:38,750
You've got backspin

861
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,750
and drifting.

862
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:45,599
Drifting.

863
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,840
Drifting does a

864
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,840
decent damage, but with a high crit.

865
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,840
It takes 23

866
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,210
guts to use.

867
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:56,210
It has no effect. This has no effect

868
00:50:56,210 --> 00:51:00,539
either. Well,

869
00:51:00,539 --> 00:51:02,539
so it's obviously a power-based

870
00:51:02,539 --> 00:51:07,019
monster. Goddammit.

871
00:51:07,019 --> 00:51:11,059
This thing sucks.

872
00:51:11,059 --> 00:51:13,230
Looks like power and

873
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:16,820
accuracy. I don't know what you're gonna have to do.

874
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:18,989
Alright, let's do some training

875
00:51:18,989 --> 00:51:20,989
here. Let's see if we can get this any better.

876
00:51:20,989 --> 00:51:26,179
Schedule. We got no

877
00:51:26,179 --> 00:51:28,179
rest. Power.

878
00:51:28,179 --> 00:51:30,179
The next week. Power again.

879
00:51:30,179 --> 00:51:32,539
You can rest and then

880
00:51:32,539 --> 00:51:34,909
let's go with

881
00:51:34,909 --> 00:51:37,340
shadow boxing.

882
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,340
Shadow boxing.

883
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:42,610
Rest. Power.

884
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:44,610
Rest. No.

885
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:46,980
Power.

886
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,219
Alright, let's go for it. Let's see if I can get

887
00:51:49,219 --> 00:51:55,489
anything better.

888
00:51:55,489 --> 00:52:01,440
It just picks up its wheel.

889
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,440
That's all it does. It just lifts up

890
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,860
its wheel over and over again.

891
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,860
I didn't see it fit. Okay, that's

892
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,860
why notifications don't go

893
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:13,860
through audio-wise because I'm plugged into

894
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:15,860
the PlayStation 2.

895
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:17,860
But Comedy Chatman gave 50

896
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:20,539
bucks. Thank you so much Comedy

897
00:52:20,539 --> 00:52:22,539
Chatman. Five

898
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:26,639
thousand bits. I will not financially

899
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:28,639
support a man who plays Monster Hunter.

900
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:30,639
It's not about the money this time. It's about

901
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:32,639
the message. Well, this is Monster

902
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:34,639
Rancher, so I'm not playing Monster

903
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:36,639
Hunter, so that's fine.

904
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:38,639
He's doing CrossFit.

905
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:43,550
This is such a weird,

906
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:45,550
uncanny, strange person here.

907
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:49,070
But thank you so much Comedy Chatman

908
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:51,070
for the 50 fucking dollars.

909
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:53,309
How much does that

910
00:52:53,309 --> 00:52:55,309
raise it by? Not by very much, but

911
00:52:55,309 --> 00:52:57,809
I feel like we can take this thing

912
00:52:57,809 --> 00:53:12,639
somewhere.

913
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:14,639
Somebody said, is the wheel part of

914
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:16,639
his flesh? It has to be.

915
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:20,289
Watching Who five community subs. Thank

916
00:53:20,289 --> 00:53:26,369
you, Watching Who. So much better than

917
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,369
Mao's. Well, statistically, no.

918
00:53:28,369 --> 00:53:30,670
But aesthetically, yes.

919
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:35,150
Yeah, this is part of his

920
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:37,150
body. This weird wheel is part of his

921
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:39,519
body. It's somehow detached.

922
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:42,340
Creepily enough. Alright, let's go.

923
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:45,090
You don't need to eat right now.

924
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:55,519
The moonlight is bright tonight, just like

925
00:53:55,519 --> 00:54:00,130
the other night. Where is Vroomer

926
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:06,269
heading off to? Okay, for a second I thought

927
00:54:06,269 --> 00:54:08,269
that was the car noise going by.

928
00:54:08,269 --> 00:54:10,269
I was about to be like, you gotta be kidding me.

929
00:54:10,269 --> 00:54:12,769
Well, Rio, I can see the monsters love

930
00:54:12,769 --> 00:54:14,769
you, like they always do.

931
00:54:14,769 --> 00:54:18,099
I have an idea. Why don't you run the ranch

932
00:54:18,099 --> 00:54:20,849
along with that boy, Fane?

933
00:54:20,849 --> 00:54:22,849
I'm sure it'll be a lot of fun. Don't you

934
00:54:22,849 --> 00:54:26,179
believe Vroomer? I can't.

935
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:28,179
It'll just turn out the same as always.

936
00:54:28,179 --> 00:54:30,179
They'll become scared of me and

937
00:54:30,179 --> 00:54:34,530
eventually hate me. I don't want

938
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:36,530
to be hated again.

939
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:39,019
You mustn't assume things, Rio.

940
00:54:39,019 --> 00:54:41,019
You've got to open your eyes. Be brave

941
00:54:41,019 --> 00:54:43,019
and say what you want to say.

942
00:54:43,019 --> 00:54:47,949
When you have too many sequels, you just start to make

943
00:54:47,949 --> 00:54:49,949
like a dumb fucked up story when it's just

944
00:54:49,949 --> 00:54:51,949
about like raising monsters and like battling them

945
00:54:51,949 --> 00:54:53,949
Pokemon style. Why are we doing like talking to like a magic

946
00:54:53,949 --> 00:54:58,559
tree in this game? Ai!

947
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:02,829
What? What, Fane?

948
00:55:02,829 --> 00:55:05,650
No, don't look at me!

949
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:07,650
No, it's alright, Rio. You can't hide

950
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:09,949
it forever. I told you she was a monster.

951
00:55:09,949 --> 00:55:11,949
It's a beautiful moon tonight anyway.

952
00:55:11,949 --> 00:55:14,260
Why not talk it all out?

953
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:18,539
My name is

954
00:55:18,539 --> 00:55:21,730
Mukruji. Trees

955
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:23,730
with unusual powers like myself

956
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:25,730
are called Spirit Trees.

957
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:27,730
Who's talking? Oh, he is.

958
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:30,289
I'm one of the- I was gonna say, you're not a tree.

959
00:55:30,289 --> 00:55:32,289
Like, pretending to be a tree.

960
00:55:32,289 --> 00:55:35,619
I'm one of the oldest

961
00:55:35,619 --> 00:55:38,559
Spirit Trees. And at some point

962
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:40,559
in my life, I learned to speak human

963
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:44,719
a bit. At some point, I learned how to speak

964
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:49,250
human. Every language.

965
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:54,880
I didn't want to surprise them, so during

966
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,909
the day, I stay quiet. Wow, but

967
00:55:58,909 --> 00:56:00,909
you know, isn't it kind of sad to

968
00:56:00,909 --> 00:56:06,289
stay quiet even though you can speak?

969
00:56:06,289 --> 00:56:09,550
What do you- You humans

970
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:11,550
have nothing but fear of any kind of power.

971
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:13,860
You don't understand. You attack it!

972
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:17,619
Rio, what are you doing? I'm

973
00:56:17,619 --> 00:56:19,619
sorry about her. Rio, you see, is a very

974
00:56:19,619 --> 00:56:21,619
unusual girl. She's a part

975
00:56:21,619 --> 00:56:23,980
tree. She has the power to talk to

976
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:27,570
monsters. And from a young age,

977
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:29,570
that power was feared by others

978
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:33,219
and she was disliked for it.

979
00:56:33,219 --> 00:56:36,420
I didn't know that. I'm sorry, Rio, but

980
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,360
you shouldn't keep your thoughts to yourself.

981
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,360
If you do, you'll never be able to share your feelings.

982
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:44,300
Rio, you just have more chances

983
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,300
to understand others than ordinary people do.

984
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,989
This is what happens when writers and developers get bored.

985
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:51,230
It just is. This is Monster Rancher 4.

986
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:56,139
You know what I mean? At some point,

987
00:56:56,139 --> 00:56:59,090
you just, like, you don't want to make

988
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:02,030
Monster Rancher 2 again.

989
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:04,780
So now you're making-

990
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:11,820
It's like you got bored and you're gonna make something else.

991
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:14,130
Yeah, chances. To be able to speak

992
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:16,130
and understand monster language, that's an amazing

993
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:21,179
opportunity. I've never thought about

994
00:57:21,179 --> 00:57:25,219
it that way. I was always just so scared.

995
00:57:25,219 --> 00:57:27,219
I couldn't look at it that way. Does this happen in

996
00:57:27,219 --> 00:57:29,219
the anime? Or is the anime like a different

997
00:57:29,219 --> 00:57:34,079
universe? If you close your heart, you'll never

998
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:36,079
be able to rid yourself of your fears.

999
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:39,460
You might be right,

1000
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:42,269
Sora. Oh, it's about time for me to go

1001
00:57:42,269 --> 00:57:48,269
home. Good night, Fane.

1002
00:57:48,269 --> 00:57:55,420
Yeah, good night, Rio. Okay.

1003
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:57,420
Do nothing and proceed to the next week. Let's go.

1004
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:05,039
May, week two. Spring.

1005
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:09,500
Another day ahead of us, Vroomer.

1006
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,940
Wait, Fane, first, take this. What is it?

1007
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,619
It's my extra special battle practice,

1008
00:58:14,619 --> 00:58:19,039
Kitty Meowser. First, use this

1009
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:21,039
to review monster battles, okay?

1010
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:23,860
What's with you today, Yuri? Pretty early

1011
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:25,860
to be bouncing off the walls.

1012
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:29,179
You wanna know why? Cause I'm determined

1013
00:58:29,179 --> 00:58:31,179
to beat that nasty girl in the competition.

1014
00:58:31,179 --> 00:58:33,420
I'll kick her butt to Kingdom

1015
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,420
Come. I'll send her to a one-way trip to

1016
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:38,179
La La Land. Vroomer!

1017
00:58:38,179 --> 00:58:40,179
Imagine this is her and let her

1018
00:58:40,179 --> 00:58:43,250
have it. We're gonna get beat by the training

1019
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:54,320
dummy. Vroomer versus Meowser.

1020
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:58,420
Alright, do I get to see the

1021
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:00,420
their stats? They usually have the screen.

1022
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:05,409
I guess that is their stats. Ready.

1023
00:59:05,409 --> 00:59:07,900
Fight. Alright, here we go.

1024
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:10,269
You ready, Fane? Here I go.

1025
00:59:10,269 --> 00:59:12,269
First, approach the opponent. Get into short

1026
00:59:12,269 --> 00:59:15,219
range.

1027
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:17,219
Hey, don't back up. Get close. I'm trying.

1028
00:59:17,219 --> 00:59:21,699
You moving the camera around. There you go.

1029
00:59:21,699 --> 00:59:23,699
That's within short range.

1030
00:59:23,699 --> 00:59:26,260
Next is step back.

1031
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:28,260
Press the D-pad or left stick away from the opponent

1032
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:31,840
then push the triangle button.

1033
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,530
Yep, that's just like the second one.

1034
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:37,730
Yes, perfect. This is called a

1035
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:39,900
step back. Don't forget.

1036
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:42,139
Next is a step in. Push the D-pad

1037
00:59:42,139 --> 00:59:44,139
or left stick toward the opponent then push triangle.

1038
00:59:44,139 --> 00:59:47,730
Yep, you need like a little dash to get close.

1039
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:49,730
Exactamundo.

1040
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:51,730
All tens. This is called a step in.

1041
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:53,900
Next is a slam. Get close to

1042
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,900
your opponent and push. Yeah, you can break

1043
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:59,619
it up, right? Nice

1044
00:59:59,619 --> 01:00:02,179
throw. Next, use panel rotation

1045
01:00:02,179 --> 01:00:04,179
to select a move. R1 and R2

1046
01:00:04,179 --> 01:00:06,179
buttons swivel it around.

1047
01:00:06,179 --> 01:00:10,139
R1, okay. You get multiple panels.

1048
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:17,059
Panel rotation.

1049
01:00:17,059 --> 01:00:21,920
Try your skills. Give them hell. Move to the distance

1050
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,920
set in the skill panel. Yep.

1051
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,920
And push the O, X, or you can push any button.

1052
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,250
Okay, so

1053
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:32,940
drift. Guts

1054
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:36,719
down. Very good. Now you're ready to

1055
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:40,300
compete in the tournaments.

1056
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,860
It's just like the second game.

1057
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:44,860
The combat is very much

1058
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:49,019
the second game. I don't know how it was in the

1059
01:00:49,019 --> 01:00:51,019
third game. I don't think we even saw combat in the third game.

1060
01:00:51,019 --> 01:00:56,019
I didn't like the third game at all.

1061
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:58,320
Okay, so use the skills screen

1062
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,320
under monster data to assign monster skills to the

1063
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:06,269
panel, right?

1064
01:01:06,269 --> 01:01:08,269
After you learn a new skill, don't forget to assign it

1065
01:01:08,269 --> 01:01:10,269
to a panel. You can't use the

1066
01:01:10,269 --> 01:01:13,409
skill without it being assigned.

1067
01:01:13,409 --> 01:01:15,409
Also, if you learn knowledge of fire, et cetera,

1068
01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:17,409
you can assign elements to certain skills.

1069
01:01:17,409 --> 01:01:20,219
That's a whole nother layer.

1070
01:01:20,219 --> 01:01:22,400
Try to figure out the weak points of your

1071
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,400
enemies. You got it? Yes.

1072
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,699
Practice makes perfect. Do your best.

1073
01:01:26,699 --> 01:01:31,630
Alright.

1074
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:33,809
So.

1075
01:01:33,809 --> 01:01:36,559
Let's go to the schedule here.

1076
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:40,079
Yeah. We're gonna do power here.

1077
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:43,340
Go for it.

1078
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:46,929
No, no, no, no, no. This.

1079
01:01:46,929 --> 01:01:51,019
Are these games actually any good?

1080
01:01:51,019 --> 01:01:53,460
They are. There we go.

1081
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,460
Plus nine. Level eight

1082
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:57,460
power. New move, maybe?

1083
01:01:57,460 --> 01:02:03,980
How you doing? Eh, you're a little

1084
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:05,980
not that tired. You're fine.

1085
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:11,019
Good work. He looks like a

1086
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:13,019
beanie baby. He does

1087
01:02:13,019 --> 01:02:16,099
look like a beanie baby.

1088
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:19,550
Nice job, rumor.

1089
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:25,820
Let's keep going to the weekend.

1090
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:35,420
Which one is my favorite? Monster

1091
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:38,690
Arranger 2 is probably the best.

1092
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:40,989
So far, at least. Let's try entering

1093
01:02:40,989 --> 01:02:42,989
a competition. Sounds like a good idea.

1094
01:02:42,989 --> 01:02:45,360
But I don't really know how. Maybe

1095
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,360
we should go talk to Cynthia about it.

1096
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:50,559
Hehe, I thought you'd say that. So I brought

1097
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:52,559
a competition calendar. Use this

1098
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,559
to enter the competition.

1099
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:56,559
First, use the cursor to mark the competition that

1100
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:58,559
you want to enter on the calendar. Right, you just

1101
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,559
go. I get it.

1102
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:02,559
Then select the monster and add it to the schedule.

1103
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:06,530
Next, find a weekend

1104
01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:08,530
that a competition is being held and

1105
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:10,530
selected as your weekend activity.

1106
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:13,659
Also, to enter official competitions,

1107
01:03:13,659 --> 01:03:15,659
you have to first earn star points

1108
01:03:15,659 --> 01:03:17,659
from normal competitions.

1109
01:03:17,659 --> 01:03:19,659
If you win an official competition, your monster's

1110
01:03:19,659 --> 01:03:21,659
rank rises. And you can enter

1111
01:03:21,659 --> 01:03:24,480
higher ranked competition.

1112
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,480
But to enter the top ranked official competition, your breeder

1113
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,480
rank has to rise, too.

1114
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,480
Only the association can

1115
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,480
It's hard to know when your rank

1116
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,480
will, yeah. So I guess you just

1117
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,480
have to hope for the best.

1118
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,849
I guess that's about it. Well, did you get all that?

1119
01:03:38,849 --> 01:03:41,280
Yeah. You're all set.

1120
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,059
Let's beat that annoying

1121
01:03:45,059 --> 01:03:47,059
TT girl. Welcome to Monster Rancher 4

1122
01:03:47,059 --> 01:03:53,820
calendar.

1123
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:56,900
So we have

1124
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:59,329
800 bucks.

1125
01:03:59,329 --> 01:04:02,719
And we get a potato. What a

1126
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:04,719
shitty competition. So we're currently

1127
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:07,539
E ranked. You climb

1128
01:04:07,539 --> 01:04:09,539
all the way up to S. I think the highest we've ever

1129
01:04:09,539 --> 01:04:11,539
been in Monster Rancher 2 was

1130
01:04:11,539 --> 01:04:13,539
like A or B, right? That's the farthest

1131
01:04:13,539 --> 01:04:15,539
we got before I stopped playing.

1132
01:04:15,539 --> 01:04:19,500
Alright, so this is the single raspberry

1133
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,500
cup. This is today, right?

1134
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:32,300
Potato, tournament,

1135
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:34,300
tournament prize. It's all the same thing.

1136
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:37,059
So this is May. This is week

1137
01:04:37,059 --> 01:04:39,059
four. Let's

1138
01:04:39,059 --> 01:04:41,059
wait. Let's get this one.

1139
01:04:41,059 --> 01:04:43,059
Week two, June.

1140
01:04:43,059 --> 01:04:46,380
Let's enter this one.

1141
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:55,460
All set, right?

1142
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:57,460
Yeah. Rumor's in there, right?

1143
01:04:57,460 --> 01:05:03,730
So now let's look at the schedule.

1144
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:05,730
So June,

1145
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:07,730
here it is. Let's

1146
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:10,030
actually rest up. See if we

1147
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:13,679
can do anything here.

1148
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:16,289
Let's train

1149
01:05:16,289 --> 01:05:19,230
today. And then

1150
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:21,230
train tomorrow

1151
01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:23,230
here.

1152
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:25,230
And then rest the day before.

1153
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:34,369
So we got shadow box,

1154
01:05:34,369 --> 01:05:36,539
exercise, rest.

1155
01:05:36,539 --> 01:05:38,539
And then rest the day at the tournament too.

1156
01:05:38,539 --> 01:05:41,360
Sounds pretty sick to me.

1157
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:47,619
Here we go.

1158
01:05:47,619 --> 01:05:49,619
Any points? Plus seven points inaccuracy.

1159
01:05:49,619 --> 01:06:05,360
Should we like play or something?

1160
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:08,050
Alright, let's

1161
01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:10,050
give you some food. What do you eat for food?

1162
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:12,050
Is this a carnivore?

1163
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:14,610
I don't think so. Mango?

1164
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:18,380
Here, try one of these.

1165
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:24,400
I think he liked it. I think that means I like

1166
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:30,030
it. He's doing okay.

1167
01:06:30,030 --> 01:06:35,090
Let's just go to the weekend.

1168
01:06:35,090 --> 01:06:38,800
Competition. Enter

1169
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,800
monster being raised in competition. No.

1170
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:50,829
Not ready yet.

1171
01:06:50,829 --> 01:06:52,829
So this is week four.

1172
01:06:52,829 --> 01:07:01,650
Lift.

1173
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:06,130
Nice. Still have a really high success rate.

1174
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:08,559
During free time you can

1175
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:11,380
feed and praise, scold.

1176
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:14,579
You can give items too.

1177
01:07:14,579 --> 01:07:19,440
Praise. It's bouncing with

1178
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,440
agony. You need to euthanize this thing.

1179
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,440
What? No.

1180
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,809
What are you talking about?

1181
01:07:25,809 --> 01:07:30,800
It's having like a bunch of fun.

1182
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:33,099
Alright, here we go. Weekend.

1183
01:07:33,099 --> 01:07:35,099
How's this? Let's take a look at the stats now.

1184
01:07:35,099 --> 01:07:37,280
Not bad.

1185
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,280
156, 134.

1186
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,280
It'll be probably around like 160.

1187
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:47,679
What's it carrying?

1188
01:07:47,679 --> 01:07:49,679
It's carrying its own body, which is a wheel.

1189
01:07:49,679 --> 01:07:55,949
Somehow. Alright, this is the last week

1190
01:07:55,949 --> 01:07:59,659
before the tournament.

1191
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:08,239
This is a day of rest.

1192
01:08:08,239 --> 01:08:10,239
Be gentle to this kind creature. I am.

1193
01:08:10,239 --> 01:08:14,130
I don't think there's

1194
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:16,130
anything else I can do, so I might as well just

1195
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,130
begin the training.

1196
01:08:18,130 --> 01:08:20,130
Isn't the training just rest?

1197
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:22,130
It is, right?

1198
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:25,140
Yeah.

1199
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:38,770
Alright, it's kind of...

1200
01:08:38,770 --> 01:08:40,770
Is this like... This looks like roadkill.

1201
01:08:40,770 --> 01:08:49,409
Is that like part of the thing

1202
01:08:49,409 --> 01:08:52,029
here? Steal the

1203
01:08:52,029 --> 01:08:55,039
wheel. Roll the wheel

1204
01:08:55,039 --> 01:08:59,840
off the cliff.

1205
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,840
I'm not gonna do that.

1206
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:06,819
Have another mango.

1207
01:09:06,819 --> 01:09:11,229
You killed him. Alright.

1208
01:09:11,229 --> 01:09:13,229
Very lively, not tired.

1209
01:09:13,229 --> 01:09:16,180
Focused. I think

1210
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:19,310
it's time. Let's see if we can

1211
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:21,310
win a tournament.

1212
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:27,840
So, here we go.

1213
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,840
Calendar of tournaments today.

1214
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:31,840
There are four

1215
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:35,420
rivals.

1216
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:37,420
You're not really that

1217
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:39,420
strong, but it's okay.

1218
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:42,050
This is also... This is rest today.

1219
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:46,960
Relax. Here we go.

1220
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:58,159
Competition.

1221
01:09:58,159 --> 01:10:00,460
Single Battle

1222
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:02,460
Hydrangia Cup.

1223
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:04,460
Rumor is in it.

1224
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:06,460
Take part in the scheduled competition.

1225
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:08,460
Yes. Let's see if we can make something happen.

1226
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:21,329
Ladies and gentlemen,

1227
01:10:21,329 --> 01:10:23,329
here it is, the Hydrangia Cup.

1228
01:10:23,329 --> 01:10:26,140
Who will arise victorious?

1229
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:28,140
There can only be one.

1230
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:31,149
Now let the tournament begin. That's a weird

1231
01:10:31,149 --> 01:10:33,710
device around his neck.

1232
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:36,460
Is that what he's yelling into?

1233
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:38,460
That's like a weird... That's a weird microphone.

1234
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:42,109
Alright, so we've got

1235
01:10:42,109 --> 01:10:44,109
Rumor, Cypher, Charon, and

1236
01:10:44,109 --> 01:10:47,500
Ober. Let's take a look at the info.

1237
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:50,369
Enemy. So,

1238
01:10:50,369 --> 01:10:52,369
Cypher is a chump.

1239
01:10:52,369 --> 01:10:55,250
Low... I got higher power.

1240
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:57,250
Low into... Yeah.

1241
01:10:57,250 --> 01:11:04,850
Life is not that bad.

1242
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:07,470
I think this will be easy.

1243
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:11,380
Give commands. Let's go.

1244
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:15,920
35 speed.

1245
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:17,920
Alright, Rumor. Let's fucking run him over.

1246
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:20,930
Rumor versus Cypher.

1247
01:11:20,930 --> 01:11:24,579
Cypher looks like it is

1248
01:11:24,579 --> 01:11:26,579
in complete and total agony.

1249
01:11:26,579 --> 01:11:30,739
That thing is fucked up.

1250
01:11:30,739 --> 01:11:33,170
It's got five... One,

1251
01:11:33,170 --> 01:11:35,170
two, three, four, five faces probably?

1252
01:11:35,170 --> 01:11:37,170
Are the faces on the feet?

1253
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:45,659
Here we go.

1254
01:11:45,659 --> 01:11:47,659
I'm trying to back it up. Guts 59.

1255
01:11:47,659 --> 01:11:49,899
Let's actually...

1256
01:11:49,899 --> 01:11:52,659
Let's get in closer.

1257
01:11:52,659 --> 01:11:56,819
Bullish. Backspin.

1258
01:11:56,819 --> 01:11:59,949
Nice!

1259
01:11:59,949 --> 01:12:04,880
Oh, that's a good move.

1260
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,880
It just almost killed me.

1261
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,880
I'm almost dead.

1262
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,979
Okay. I gotta get in closer,

1263
01:12:12,979 --> 01:12:15,220
I think. Yeah, stay in close.

1264
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:23,460
Got him.

1265
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:27,229
Look at me! That was almost pretty

1266
01:12:27,229 --> 01:12:29,229
bad. Okay, who's next?

1267
01:12:29,229 --> 01:12:36,590
This is Charon and Ober.

1268
01:12:36,590 --> 01:12:39,729
I think it just tells you who wins.

1269
01:12:39,729 --> 01:12:42,739
Alright.

1270
01:12:42,739 --> 01:12:44,739
Looks like Ober has the upper hand here.

1271
01:12:44,739 --> 01:12:47,279
Ober wins.

1272
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:49,279
So it's Rumor versus Ober in the championship for this.

1273
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:56,510
Let's take a look at the other one.

1274
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:58,510
I need more defense. I almost got one shot.

1275
01:12:58,510 --> 01:13:00,510
Alright, so this is a chump.

1276
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:03,819
What kind of...

1277
01:13:03,819 --> 01:13:09,970
I think I'm ready.

1278
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:19,819
Rumor versus Uber.

1279
01:13:19,819 --> 01:13:22,770
That's not a bad looking monster though.

1280
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:24,770
Alright, let's see what they got.

1281
01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:26,770
Right in the middle, let's go right up front.

1282
01:13:26,770 --> 01:13:28,770
Started off with a drift.

1283
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:31,520
I fucking crushed him again.

1284
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,520
Don't even let him do anything. Again.

1285
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,890
He blocked it.

1286
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:38,699
Again. See you later.

1287
01:13:38,699 --> 01:13:53,229
Champion.

1288
01:13:53,229 --> 01:13:55,229
The winner of this terrific battle is

1289
01:13:55,229 --> 01:13:57,229
Rumor. Congratulations.

1290
01:13:57,229 --> 01:14:05,659
I've got really weird hands.

1291
01:14:05,659 --> 01:14:07,659
The timing, yeah.

1292
01:14:07,659 --> 01:14:09,659
800G and a potato.

1293
01:14:09,659 --> 01:14:12,989
Plus five fame for Rumor.

1294
01:14:12,989 --> 01:14:18,180
He was so happy he just

1295
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:22,340
drove by the house.

1296
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:24,340
InvincedGerman has a key to play the vroom noise.

1297
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:27,279
No.

1298
01:14:27,279 --> 01:14:29,970
Nice work.

1299
01:14:29,970 --> 01:14:31,970
Let's take a look at the schedule.

1300
01:14:31,970 --> 01:14:34,590
Yeah, when's the next...

1301
01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:36,590
Wait, wait. When's the next tournament?

1302
01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:39,710
So I got a star.

1303
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:41,710
This is...

1304
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:43,710
Let's do... What's this one?

1305
01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:45,710
This is a single official grade E tournament.

1306
01:14:45,710 --> 01:14:47,710
This is the real one.

1307
01:14:47,710 --> 01:14:49,710
I think I can enter this though.

1308
01:14:49,710 --> 01:14:51,710
Because I have a star.

1309
01:14:51,710 --> 01:14:53,710
Can I enter this?

1310
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:55,710
And just prepare for it?

1311
01:14:55,710 --> 01:14:58,909
The monster does not have enough points

1312
01:14:58,909 --> 01:15:00,909
to enter the official league battle.

1313
01:15:00,909 --> 01:15:02,909
Ah, fuck off.

1314
01:15:02,909 --> 01:15:07,779
Let's do this one.

1315
01:15:07,779 --> 01:15:10,909
We just have to stomp on him.

1316
01:15:10,909 --> 01:15:12,909
Alright, let's take a look at the schedule.

1317
01:15:12,909 --> 01:15:14,909
Let's do exercise and then rest.

1318
01:15:14,909 --> 01:15:17,470
No, exercise,

1319
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:19,470
exercise, exercise, rest.

1320
01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:21,470
No, no, no, no.

1321
01:15:21,470 --> 01:15:23,470
Hold on.

1322
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:25,470
I'm getting into this here. Hold on.

1323
01:15:25,470 --> 01:15:28,029
No, no, no.

1324
01:15:28,029 --> 01:15:30,029
What does he need?

1325
01:15:30,029 --> 01:15:34,000
Defense is terrible. Speed is terrible.

1326
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:41,489
Let's do defense, defense.

1327
01:15:51,899 --> 01:15:53,899
Defense, defense.

1328
01:15:53,899 --> 01:15:56,510
Defense, rest.

1329
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:58,819
Defense.

1330
01:15:58,819 --> 01:16:01,060
Let him have day off in the middle.

1331
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:08,859
And then that night is the tournament.

1332
01:16:08,859 --> 01:16:10,859
You can have up to four monsters?

1333
01:16:10,859 --> 01:16:14,699
I thought...

1334
01:16:14,699 --> 01:16:16,699
I don't know if I have that unlocked yet.

1335
01:16:16,699 --> 01:16:19,899
Okay, that looks good.

1336
01:16:19,899 --> 01:16:22,720
Do I have food?

1337
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,720
I have like a potato.

1338
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:27,340
I just got my first money.

1339
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:29,340
Alright, go for it.

1340
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:34,340
Not that great.

1341
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:42,510
Plus three defense.

1342
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:44,510
This is like a fucking goofball.

1343
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:47,649
What a goofy motherfucker.

1344
01:16:47,649 --> 01:16:49,649
Alright, let's do an okay. Let's pray.

1345
01:16:49,649 --> 01:16:54,510
Skold?

1346
01:16:54,510 --> 01:16:57,779
Well, it's not his fault.

1347
01:16:57,779 --> 01:16:59,779
He's like big, dumb, and slow.

1348
01:16:59,779 --> 01:17:01,779
He's not like the fastest.

1349
01:17:01,779 --> 01:17:03,779
He can't sprint around.

1350
01:17:03,779 --> 01:17:05,779
He uses his wheel.

1351
01:17:05,779 --> 01:17:07,779
I can't be mad that he's like too slow.

1352
01:17:07,779 --> 01:17:15,140
I'm spoiling him. Skold him.

1353
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:17,140
No, I don't want to eat. He's my friend.

1354
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:19,140
I'm not going to skold him.

1355
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:21,630
Alright, food.

1356
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:23,630
Oh shit, I can only do...

1357
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:25,630
That's not good.

1358
01:17:25,630 --> 01:17:28,260
I can only...

1359
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:30,260
Why can't I feed him?

1360
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:35,310
I can only do one action

1361
01:17:35,310 --> 01:17:37,310
and feeding them is an action.

1362
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:40,449
That's not good. Okay, well...

1363
01:17:40,449 --> 01:17:44,659
The tournament is

1364
01:17:44,659 --> 01:17:46,659
tomorrow.

1365
01:17:46,659 --> 01:17:48,659
So let's feed him.

1366
01:17:50,829 --> 01:17:54,800
Make him fear you.

1367
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:57,170
Hey, you want to run your monster

1368
01:17:57,170 --> 01:17:59,170
village the way you want, I'm going to run my

1369
01:17:59,170 --> 01:18:01,170
monster village the way I want. Plus, this is like kind of...

1370
01:18:01,170 --> 01:18:03,729
This is like a little

1371
01:18:03,729 --> 01:18:10,880
janky looking...

1372
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:33,220
See what I'm talking about here? That looks weird.

1373
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:35,840
There we go. Okay, that's better.

1374
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,850
Now it's not a bunch of like

1375
01:18:38,850 --> 01:18:41,920
black bars.

1376
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:43,920
Now you can see better, can't you?

1377
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:48,270
He's not very focused.

1378
01:18:50,449 --> 01:18:52,449
All I have is a potato.

1379
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:03,140
That focused lively.

1380
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:06,510
I think he's good to go.

1381
01:19:06,510 --> 01:19:11,819
So then this is the...

1382
01:19:11,819 --> 01:19:13,819
Is this the right week?

1383
01:19:13,819 --> 01:19:15,819
No, okay, it's tomorrow.

1384
01:19:15,819 --> 01:19:20,050
Yeah, it's tomorrow.

1385
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:22,050
Yeah, he's in that one. Alright, we're good.

1386
01:19:25,619 --> 01:19:27,789
He's not dead.

1387
01:19:27,789 --> 01:19:33,170
He's fine.

1388
01:19:37,170 --> 01:19:39,170
Free food, good.

1389
01:19:49,220 --> 01:20:00,859
You come with the same

1390
01:20:00,859 --> 01:20:02,859
grocery list.

1391
01:20:02,859 --> 01:20:05,300
Alright, you're not hungry, you're not tired,

1392
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:07,600
you're pretty focused.

1393
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:11,180
And today was what?

1394
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:13,739
Today was

1395
01:20:13,739 --> 01:20:15,739
training.

1396
01:20:15,739 --> 01:20:17,739
This is for, I believe, defense, right?

1397
01:20:17,739 --> 01:20:21,199
That's good.

1398
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:24,460
Good. Five points.

1399
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:27,020
Are you tired?

1400
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:29,199
No, not really. Very lively.

1401
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:31,199
Very lively.

1402
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:34,720
Alright, let's go.

1403
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:36,720
I'm not gonna do anything.

1404
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:39,340
He's ready to fight.

1405
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:43,439
I think we have to win

1406
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:45,439
two or three of these before we can do the official tournament.

1407
01:20:45,439 --> 01:21:03,100
Ladies and gentlemen,

1408
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:05,100
representing the Bamboo Cup,

1409
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:08,050
who will arise victorious?

1410
01:21:08,050 --> 01:21:10,539
They can only be won.

1411
01:21:10,539 --> 01:21:14,449
Let the tournament begin.

1412
01:21:14,449 --> 01:21:16,449
Rumor, Kylan, Gatti, and Yellow.

1413
01:21:16,449 --> 01:21:22,210
Oh, fuck, this is not good.

1414
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:24,210
Okay, really high intelligence.

1415
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:27,729
Low defense, though.

1416
01:21:27,729 --> 01:21:29,729
I think if I get two or three quick moves off,

1417
01:21:29,729 --> 01:21:32,479
like that, I'll probably bury him.

1418
01:21:32,479 --> 01:21:34,850
My intelligence is awful.

1419
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:38,369
He's got Tail Whip,

1420
01:21:38,369 --> 01:21:41,760
Spit, and Kiss.

1421
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:44,449
Kiss is the thing you want to look out for.

1422
01:21:44,449 --> 01:21:46,449
That's the only thing that does intelligence damage.

1423
01:21:46,449 --> 01:21:48,449
So wherever Kiss is on his slot...

1424
01:21:48,449 --> 01:21:50,689
Wait a minute.

1425
01:21:50,689 --> 01:21:52,689
I'm not even fighting this.

1426
01:21:52,689 --> 01:21:55,500
Alright, well, good luck, everybody.

1427
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:01,199
No, what? No, no, no, no, no.

1428
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:03,199
Shit, I wanted to give commands. I hate when it does that.

1429
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:07,489
He's gonna always on his own.

1430
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:15,039
I wanted to look at the other menu for a second.

1431
01:22:15,039 --> 01:22:17,039
Alright, good luck. Good luck, Rumor.

1432
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:19,039
Don't get hit by anything.

1433
01:22:19,039 --> 01:22:23,520
Good job.

1434
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,760
I'm so glad you're doing this.

1435
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:27,760
I would have reacted five times faster than you.

1436
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,760
Come on, do it again. Quick.

1437
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,760
Don't let him do anything. Kill him.

1438
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:33,760
Don't let him do his move. He's gonna do the Spit.

1439
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:36,880
Do it. Do something.

1440
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,880
Do it quick before you die. Do it.

1441
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,439
Stop shifting.

1442
01:22:41,439 --> 01:22:43,439
Oh, thank god.

1443
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:53,489
That almost was a disaster.

1444
01:22:53,489 --> 01:22:59,310
Okay. Don't yell at him.

1445
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:08,079
Gatti just destroyed Kylon.

1446
01:23:08,079 --> 01:23:11,539
So Gatti's the one with the one win.

1447
01:23:11,539 --> 01:23:14,100
And it's the person we're about to face.

1448
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:16,100
No, we're not.

1449
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:18,590
Kylon versus Yellow.

1450
01:23:18,590 --> 01:23:22,800
Alright, so Yellow just sucks.

1451
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,800
The high intelligence doesn't really matter at all.

1452
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:28,050
Alright, here we go.

1453
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:30,930
Info. Gatti.

1454
01:23:30,930 --> 01:23:34,960
Stats are very low.

1455
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,260
Just fast.

1456
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:55,500
But sometimes it's all it takes.

1457
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,500
Is this the evolved version of the monster that I had

1458
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:03,199
but without legs?

1459
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:05,199
It looks like it. It looks like Snoopy's cousin.

1460
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:07,760
But with no legs.

1461
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:10,899
Spike. That just is Fireman.

1462
01:24:10,899 --> 01:24:15,949
No, if he had no arms it would be.

1463
01:24:15,949 --> 01:24:19,149
No, he does have legs.

1464
01:24:19,149 --> 01:24:21,149
No, not good. Break it up. Break it up. Break it up.

1465
01:24:21,149 --> 01:24:27,729
You missed.

1466
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:29,729
That was a yo-yo.

1467
01:24:29,729 --> 01:24:32,539
No, don't let him.

1468
01:24:32,539 --> 01:24:35,300
Alright, getting close and hitting with drift.

1469
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:37,300
Oh, fuck. Back it up. Back it up.

1470
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:40,109
I need more guts.

1471
01:24:40,109 --> 01:24:43,380
I haven't hit anything.

1472
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:45,380
That's not good.

1473
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:47,680
Get it. Yes.

1474
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:50,180
One hit kill. Do it again.

1475
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:52,180
I just made him mad.

1476
01:24:52,180 --> 01:24:54,720
Again?

1477
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:57,090
No.

1478
01:24:57,090 --> 01:25:02,270
I got plenty of guts still. It's okay.

1479
01:25:02,270 --> 01:25:06,430
Is it the speed of the defense?

1480
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:08,930
He's blocking everything.

1481
01:25:08,930 --> 01:25:14,560
Holy shit, man.

1482
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,560
I'm almost out of guts.

1483
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:21,220
He's just gonna wear me down.

1484
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:23,220
Oh, shit. Okay, I have to hit him here.

1485
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:26,460
Hit it.

1486
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:35,619
Yes. Hurry.

1487
01:25:35,619 --> 01:25:40,270
Alright, that's two and all.

1488
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:42,270
That's pretty much tournament victory as long as

1489
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:44,270
I pretty much win.

1490
01:25:44,270 --> 01:25:47,920
Gatti in yellow.

1491
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:51,869
Gatti loses?

1492
01:25:51,869 --> 01:25:55,140
Yeah, that's it. That's game over. I win.

1493
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:57,140
The only way it's possible is if I lose to Kylon.

1494
01:25:57,140 --> 01:25:59,140
Which, I mean,

1495
01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:01,140
that's not gonna happen.

1496
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:07,199
Well, it might.

1497
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:09,199
168 accuracy, 133 speed.

1498
01:26:09,199 --> 01:26:11,760
Terrible power, though.

1499
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,939
Kylon's moves are awful.

1500
01:26:13,939 --> 01:26:16,239
It's just a question of

1501
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:18,239
not being able to hit them.

1502
01:26:26,609 --> 01:26:28,609
53 power. Yeah.

1503
01:26:28,609 --> 01:26:31,039
But my defense is bad, too, though.

1504
01:26:31,039 --> 01:26:35,500
It'll still hurt.

1505
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,500
It's Vrombor versus Umbrella Head Dog.

1506
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:41,020
Alright, we wanna

1507
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:43,020
stay away from the one in the back.

1508
01:26:43,020 --> 01:26:49,939
Got it.

1509
01:26:49,939 --> 01:26:56,130
Damn.

1510
01:26:56,130 --> 01:27:00,100
There it is. Dude, again, quick. Don't even let him do anything.

1511
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:02,720
Again.

1512
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:05,470
Again.

1513
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:07,470
Fuck. Alright.

1514
01:27:07,470 --> 01:27:11,500
I gotta learn a new move.

1515
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,810
Stupid drift.

1516
01:27:13,810 --> 01:27:19,250
That's a victory.

1517
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:25,649
The winner of this terrific battle

1518
01:27:25,649 --> 01:27:27,649
is Vrombor.

1519
01:27:27,649 --> 01:27:38,979
Congratulations. On cue.

1520
01:27:38,979 --> 01:27:40,979
I'm not doing that.

1521
01:27:40,979 --> 01:27:42,979
I'm not pressing a button to have a loud

1522
01:27:42,979 --> 01:27:45,789
engine sound.

1523
01:27:45,789 --> 01:27:48,800
Got a banana this time.

1524
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:59,619
Five more fame points?

1525
01:27:59,619 --> 01:28:01,619
Vrombor's better than Beanbag Sonic, and that's

1526
01:28:01,619 --> 01:28:05,710
debatable. Nice work.

1527
01:28:05,710 --> 01:28:07,710
So, I think...

1528
01:28:07,710 --> 01:28:09,710
Let me see. I have two stars now.

1529
01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:11,710
What does it take? Official Cup?

1530
01:28:11,710 --> 01:28:13,710
No.

1531
01:28:13,710 --> 01:28:15,710
I need three stars.

1532
01:28:15,710 --> 01:28:17,710
When's the next Official Cup?

1533
01:28:17,710 --> 01:28:19,710
Oh, Jesus.

1534
01:28:19,710 --> 01:28:23,229
Official Grade E. When's the next

1535
01:28:23,229 --> 01:28:25,229
Official Grade E?

1536
01:28:25,229 --> 01:28:27,229
Oh, no.

1537
01:28:27,229 --> 01:28:29,729
That's not till October.

1538
01:28:29,729 --> 01:28:31,729
He's gonna

1539
01:28:31,729 --> 01:28:33,970
die.

1540
01:28:33,970 --> 01:28:35,970
Um.

1541
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:37,970
Yeah, I'm gonna have to wait.

1542
01:28:37,970 --> 01:28:39,970
Wait.

1543
01:28:39,970 --> 01:28:41,970
Oh, you mean this July? No. There's no end.

1544
01:28:41,970 --> 01:28:43,970
There's this one here.

1545
01:28:43,970 --> 01:28:45,970
But I don't have enough.

1546
01:28:45,970 --> 01:28:47,970
We have to wait till October.

1547
01:28:51,170 --> 01:28:53,170
Dammit. Alright. Well.

1548
01:28:53,170 --> 01:28:59,300
Freeze him?

1549
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:01,300
I don't know. Do you think I should freeze him now?

1550
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:04,430
He's doing so well.

1551
01:29:04,430 --> 01:29:11,470
We got plenty of time to make more.

1552
01:29:11,470 --> 01:29:14,289
Not in his prime. Yeah.

1553
01:29:14,289 --> 01:29:16,289
Let me see the...

1554
01:29:16,289 --> 01:29:18,590
What do we need to build on here?

1555
01:29:18,590 --> 01:29:20,590
Power's good.

1556
01:29:20,590 --> 01:29:22,590
Defense could... Level 6 defense

1557
01:29:22,590 --> 01:29:24,590
is probably important. Speed is pretty

1558
01:29:24,590 --> 01:29:26,590
terrible as well. Intelligence is terrible.

1559
01:29:26,590 --> 01:29:28,899
Although I might get another move if I level up

1560
01:29:28,899 --> 01:29:33,119
power again.

1561
01:29:33,119 --> 01:29:37,729
I think.

1562
01:29:37,729 --> 01:29:41,500
I'm gonna try to get power to level 9.

1563
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:43,500
Maybe life? Life is bad too.

1564
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:45,500
Speed. There's so many things he needs.

1565
01:29:49,279 --> 01:29:52,350
Schedule it out. Alright. Let's do...

1566
01:29:52,350 --> 01:29:55,100
We have like

1567
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:57,100
two months to get him there.

1568
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:59,100
Let's do

1569
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:01,100
speed. Speed.

1570
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:05,380
Then...

1571
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:07,380
Do speed twice. And then power.

1572
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:11,020
Rest.

1573
01:30:11,020 --> 01:30:13,020
Rest in the middle of that.

1574
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:19,020
And then we'll see where we're at.

1575
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:23,619
Put in the stupid

1576
01:30:23,619 --> 01:30:25,619
invader's disc.

1577
01:30:25,619 --> 01:30:28,300
I have that here. I have a bunch of stuff.

1578
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:30,859
That's a good increase.

1579
01:30:30,859 --> 01:30:36,689
Alright. Let's feed you.

1580
01:30:36,689 --> 01:30:40,340
We're doing okay.

1581
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:44,340
Banana.

1582
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:46,340
Sweet, nutritious banana from the

1583
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:48,340
Parry jungle. Popular with kids.

1584
01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:50,340
Squid, beef.

1585
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:52,579
Let's just... potato.

1586
01:30:52,579 --> 01:30:54,579
Let's save the good food for when we need it.

1587
01:30:54,579 --> 01:31:01,359
I do have Floydgan Brothers as well. You're right.

1588
01:31:01,359 --> 01:31:05,460
Let's continue.

1589
01:31:10,369 --> 01:31:12,369
Floydgan Brothers disc or riot.

1590
01:31:12,369 --> 01:31:19,090
Yeah. I'm gonna turn the web game on.

1591
01:31:19,090 --> 01:31:21,090
Just break it.

1592
01:31:21,090 --> 01:31:24,529
What was the training today?

1593
01:31:24,529 --> 01:31:29,260
Speed.

1594
01:31:29,260 --> 01:31:31,260
Alright.

1595
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:38,369
Plus 6.

1596
01:31:38,369 --> 01:31:40,369
Tired. Good thing tomorrow's rest, right?

1597
01:31:40,369 --> 01:31:49,579
Put the other

1598
01:31:49,579 --> 01:31:52,140
monster ranchers in.

1599
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:54,140
Yeah, there's a lot of options.

1600
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:56,140
Once we get a decent...

1601
01:31:56,140 --> 01:31:58,140
How this game really functions is

1602
01:31:58,140 --> 01:32:00,140
you build up a

1603
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:02,140
monster. You make them good.

1604
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:04,140
You make them win. You get

1605
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:06,140
a good start. You freeze them.

1606
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:08,140
You make more and then you combine them.

1607
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:10,380
To make a better one.

1608
01:32:10,380 --> 01:32:13,199
In the freezer.

1609
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:18,699
Is he gonna start to rebel?

1610
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:20,699
He's okay.

1611
01:32:20,699 --> 01:32:27,100
I can't believe the bootleg space channel 5

1612
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:30,300
bullshit.

1613
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:32,300
Okay, so he's tired. Today he was resting, right?

1614
01:32:36,779 --> 01:32:39,710
So rest.

1615
01:32:39,710 --> 01:32:41,710
Then it was power.

1616
01:32:41,710 --> 01:32:43,710
Rest and then

1617
01:32:43,710 --> 01:32:45,710
let's do defense twice.

1618
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:52,020
And then we'll see where we are. Alright.

1619
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:54,020
Here's the thing about 4.

1620
01:32:54,020 --> 01:32:56,319
I like how 4 you can batch

1621
01:32:56,319 --> 01:32:58,319
out stuff to do.

1622
01:32:58,319 --> 01:33:00,319
But I do miss the minigames.

1623
01:33:00,319 --> 01:33:02,319
I miss the fun little animations.

1624
01:33:02,319 --> 01:33:09,729
It's very lively. Good.

1625
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:15,250
You good on food?

1626
01:33:15,250 --> 01:33:19,659
No, you're good. Let's go.

1627
01:33:19,659 --> 01:33:28,880
So today we've got

1628
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:30,880
power

1629
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:32,880
and then

1630
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:34,880
I don't think you need to rest after this.

1631
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,880
Power and then defense.

1632
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:38,880
Power, defense, defense.

1633
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:42,189
Hopefully we learn a new move.

1634
01:33:42,189 --> 01:33:44,189
Did you learn new moves? You have to, right?

1635
01:33:44,189 --> 01:33:49,310
Level 9, there it is.

1636
01:33:49,310 --> 01:33:51,310
Alright. Something new.

1637
01:33:51,310 --> 01:33:58,020
Did you learn to move?

1638
01:33:58,020 --> 01:34:00,020
Go to the shrine and make more insults to

1639
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:02,020
God.

1640
01:34:02,020 --> 01:34:05,220
I will, I will.

1641
01:34:05,220 --> 01:34:11,939
I promise.

1642
01:34:11,939 --> 01:34:14,239
Let me just see. Did you get any new moves?

1643
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:18,460
You only have

1644
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:20,460
these two moves.

1645
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:22,460
Nothing else?

1646
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:32,239
Is it pee time

1647
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:34,239
yet? I wanna get a drink. Ah, it will be in a

1648
01:34:34,239 --> 01:34:44,350
second.

1649
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:46,350
Is it defense day? Level 6. Yes.

1650
01:34:46,350 --> 01:34:53,390
It's almost time to pee.

1651
01:34:53,390 --> 01:34:55,390
You need to eat.

1652
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:57,390
Have a potato.

1653
01:34:57,390 --> 01:35:05,970
Okay, you're good.

1654
01:35:05,970 --> 01:35:07,970
Well, you're just okay, but that's fine.

1655
01:35:07,970 --> 01:35:17,380
I need to do one more

1656
01:35:17,380 --> 01:35:19,380
tournament before I can do the...

1657
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:21,380
Let's pick like a shitty tournament and just steamroll

1658
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:25,090
everybody.

1659
01:35:25,090 --> 01:35:27,090
Scold him for daring to ask for food.

1660
01:35:27,090 --> 01:35:29,090
You are...

1661
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:31,090
You are awful.

1662
01:35:31,090 --> 01:35:33,090
That's an awful thing to say.

1663
01:35:33,090 --> 01:35:36,159
That's just awful.

1664
01:35:36,159 --> 01:35:38,850
More defense.

1665
01:35:38,850 --> 01:35:46,399
You're good.

1666
01:35:46,399 --> 01:35:48,399
Let me see the schedule. Alright, so...

1667
01:35:48,399 --> 01:35:50,640
Calendar.

1668
01:35:54,779 --> 01:35:56,779
What do we got?

1669
01:35:56,779 --> 01:35:58,779
Okay, so we have

1670
01:35:58,779 --> 01:36:00,779
September.

1671
01:36:00,779 --> 01:36:02,779
October.

1672
01:36:02,779 --> 01:36:04,779
So we need to do...

1673
01:36:04,779 --> 01:36:06,779
Where are we? We're here.

1674
01:36:06,779 --> 01:36:08,779
We'll just do this one.

1675
01:36:08,779 --> 01:36:10,779
We'll go...

1676
01:36:10,779 --> 01:36:12,779
We'll go just make fools out of everybody

1677
01:36:12,779 --> 01:36:14,779
here. We'll go embarrass everyone here.

1678
01:36:14,779 --> 01:36:16,779
Probably get booed and shit, but whatever. Who cares?

1679
01:36:16,779 --> 01:36:19,220
Making money, right?

1680
01:36:24,220 --> 01:36:26,220
Okay, he's signed up for that one.

1681
01:36:26,220 --> 01:36:28,220
Let's get out of here.

1682
01:36:36,350 --> 01:36:39,170
Training!

1683
01:36:39,170 --> 01:36:41,470
What were you doing today?

1684
01:36:41,470 --> 01:36:46,340
Defense, right? Very good.

1685
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:52,420
He's very tired.

1686
01:36:52,420 --> 01:37:00,210
You gotta get three stars?

1687
01:37:00,210 --> 01:37:02,210
Why would they boo?

1688
01:37:02,210 --> 01:37:04,449
Um...

1689
01:37:04,449 --> 01:37:06,449
Because I'm going in there with a very strong Pokemon.

1690
01:37:06,449 --> 01:37:09,260
The strongest, it's possible.

1691
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:13,340
Alright, we need a day of rest.

1692
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:20,130
Fail?

1693
01:37:20,130 --> 01:37:22,130
Oh, no. Fall.

1694
01:37:22,130 --> 01:37:24,130
It's like, how did I fail?

1695
01:37:26,819 --> 01:37:28,819
Rest.

1696
01:37:28,819 --> 01:37:35,970
Who cares if people like you

1697
01:37:35,970 --> 01:37:37,970
if you're making cheddar?

1698
01:37:37,970 --> 01:37:41,939
Well, that, I mean...

1699
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:44,880
I need money. This is a game about money.

1700
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,880
Let's feed you

1701
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:48,880
a potato.

1702
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:50,880
And then let's go kick some ass.

1703
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:53,819
And then after I kick everybody's ass

1704
01:37:53,819 --> 01:37:57,090
in this tournament, I'm gonna go pee.

1705
01:38:01,739 --> 01:38:04,050
Competition.

1706
01:38:04,050 --> 01:38:12,500
Take part in the competition.

1707
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:21,779
The Autumn Festival.

1708
01:38:21,779 --> 01:38:23,779
Welcome to the Autumn Festival. Who will arise victorious

1709
01:38:23,779 --> 01:38:25,779
that can only be won? Now let the tournament begin.

1710
01:38:25,779 --> 01:38:28,460
Clay,

1711
01:38:28,460 --> 01:38:30,460
Decker,

1712
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:32,699
and Chara. Look at Chara's icon.

1713
01:38:32,699 --> 01:38:36,350
That looks fucking terrifying.

1714
01:38:36,350 --> 01:38:41,149
What an extreme emoji.

1715
01:38:41,149 --> 01:38:43,149
Alright, let's see.

1716
01:38:43,149 --> 01:38:45,779
This is Clay.

1717
01:38:45,779 --> 01:38:47,779
I'll kill it in two hits.

1718
01:38:47,779 --> 01:38:54,939
You know what? One hit, probably.

1719
01:38:54,939 --> 01:38:58,140
This is the equivalent.

1720
01:38:58,140 --> 01:39:00,140
You know when you played Little League?

1721
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:02,140
And some of the coaches

1722
01:39:02,140 --> 01:39:04,640
and some of the parents?

1723
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:06,640
The age range for Little League was

1724
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:08,640
like 10 to 13 years old.

1725
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:11,010
And there was the people that

1726
01:39:11,010 --> 01:39:13,010
wanted to have their like 15-year-old

1727
01:39:13,010 --> 01:39:15,010
pretend to be a 12-year-old and be on teams.

1728
01:39:15,010 --> 01:39:17,569
And just decimate. It was bullshit.

1729
01:39:17,569 --> 01:39:19,569
I don't know why people wanted to do that.

1730
01:39:19,569 --> 01:39:24,180
But that's what we're doing right now.

1731
01:39:24,180 --> 01:39:26,180
We're faking to be like a 10-year-old

1732
01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:28,180
as like a 14-year-old.

1733
01:39:28,180 --> 01:39:30,659
Like look, that didn't even hurt.

1734
01:39:30,659 --> 01:39:37,939
Come on.

1735
01:39:37,939 --> 01:39:45,039
He ain't got nothing on him.

1736
01:39:45,039 --> 01:39:47,039
Rumor. I want to end this with like

1737
01:39:47,039 --> 01:39:49,039
me killing this creature.

1738
01:39:49,039 --> 01:39:55,300
There we go.

1739
01:39:55,300 --> 01:39:57,659
No.

1740
01:39:57,659 --> 01:39:59,659
I wouldn't do such overkill.

1741
01:39:59,659 --> 01:40:03,699
Yeah, there we go. He's fighting infants.

1742
01:40:03,699 --> 01:40:06,449
I don't know. I don't understand.

1743
01:40:06,449 --> 01:40:08,449
He's batting 6.88.

1744
01:40:08,449 --> 01:40:10,449
He has 48

1745
01:40:10,449 --> 01:40:14,220
home runs.

1746
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:16,220
He reaches base almost

1747
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:18,220
8 out of 10 times he's at the plate.

1748
01:40:18,220 --> 01:40:20,220
He's like 5 feet tall

1749
01:40:20,220 --> 01:40:28,670
than everybody.

1750
01:40:28,670 --> 01:40:30,979
I wanted to see

1751
01:40:30,979 --> 01:40:33,409
that face though.

1752
01:40:33,409 --> 01:40:35,409
Chara looks really interesting.

1753
01:40:35,409 --> 01:40:38,930
This is Decker. Decker is actually pretty strong.

1754
01:40:38,930 --> 01:40:42,380
This is a scenario where whoever

1755
01:40:42,380 --> 01:40:47,380
gets the first two hits is going to win.

1756
01:40:47,380 --> 01:40:49,380
159 power.

1757
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:52,300
Well, shit, that's not good.

1758
01:40:52,300 --> 01:40:54,300
We have the same build.

1759
01:40:54,300 --> 01:41:00,000
Both bad defense, no intelligence though.

1760
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:07,170
Decker looks like

1761
01:41:07,170 --> 01:41:09,859
a child's drawing

1762
01:41:09,859 --> 01:41:17,859
of a ninja turtle.

1763
01:41:17,859 --> 01:41:20,479
This is Michelangelo.

1764
01:41:20,479 --> 01:41:22,479
Alright, no more fucking around. I actually have to focus here.

1765
01:41:22,479 --> 01:41:26,449
Whoever gets the first hit

1766
01:41:26,449 --> 01:41:29,199
is going to get it. Bingo.

1767
01:41:29,199 --> 01:41:31,199
Nice. Alright, again. Quick.

1768
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:34,529
Go, go, go, go. No, no, no, no.

1769
01:41:34,529 --> 01:41:36,529
That's not good. Alright, I gotta kill

1770
01:41:36,529 --> 01:41:38,529
him here. He's gotta die here.

1771
01:41:38,529 --> 01:41:40,899
Oh, this is bad. Back it up.

1772
01:41:40,899 --> 01:41:42,899
Back it up. Do it.

1773
01:41:42,899 --> 01:41:44,899
No. No.

1774
01:41:44,899 --> 01:41:46,899
Please. I win.

1775
01:41:46,899 --> 01:41:51,569
We both have the philosophy of

1776
01:41:51,569 --> 01:41:53,569
try to kill people in one hit

1777
01:41:53,569 --> 01:41:57,090
or two hits or you lose.

1778
01:41:57,090 --> 01:41:59,390
Alright, we got three under our belt now.

1779
01:41:59,390 --> 01:42:05,340
Time for an official championship.

1780
01:42:05,340 --> 01:42:07,710
I thought we should go to town and buy some stuff.

1781
01:42:09,779 --> 01:42:13,300
Oh, Jesus. KDK.

1782
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:15,300
KDKD.

1783
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:17,609
945. 20 community subs.

1784
01:42:17,609 --> 01:42:22,470
20.

1785
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:28,409
Thank you, KDK.

1786
01:42:28,409 --> 01:42:35,640
For the insane amount of subs.

1787
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:38,260
Call me KD.

1788
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:40,260
Alright, KD. Well, it's KDKD.

1789
01:42:40,260 --> 01:42:42,569
It's KDK.

1790
01:42:42,569 --> 01:42:47,430
But thank you, KD. I'll call you KD

1791
01:42:47,430 --> 01:42:49,430
from now on.

1792
01:42:49,430 --> 01:42:52,119
Really? Dermal lied about

1793
01:42:52,119 --> 01:42:54,420
Minecraft VR. 21

1794
01:42:54,420 --> 01:42:58,579
community subs. 21?

1795
01:42:58,579 --> 01:43:02,039
Not necessary, but thank you.

1796
01:43:02,039 --> 01:43:07,350
That's a

1797
01:43:07,350 --> 01:43:09,590
sub war. Alright.

1798
01:43:09,590 --> 01:43:11,590
That's a fucking shitload of money. Thank you, guys.

1799
01:43:14,090 --> 01:43:16,090
My god.

1800
01:43:16,090 --> 01:43:19,029
Alright, I gotta pee.

1801
01:43:19,029 --> 01:43:21,979
I'll be back in like a minute or two.

1802
01:43:21,979 --> 01:43:23,979
Gonna refill my cup here.

1803
01:43:23,979 --> 01:43:26,279
Take a piss.

1804
01:43:26,279 --> 01:47:05,539
See you in two minutes.

1805
01:47:05,539 --> 01:47:17,050
Hello. Ooh.

1806
01:47:17,050 --> 01:47:25,430
You guys have had this music on the whole time, huh?

1807
01:47:25,430 --> 01:47:27,430
Oh, yeah. I don't know what's going on with the internet.

1808
01:47:27,430 --> 01:47:29,930
I don't know.

1809
01:47:29,930 --> 01:47:36,649
Are we still good?

1810
01:47:36,649 --> 01:47:46,739
This is bad.

1811
01:47:46,739 --> 01:47:48,739
Hold on one second.

1812
01:47:48,739 --> 01:48:23,750
Give me a second.

1813
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:25,750
Well, I don't know what's going on with the internet, but

1814
01:48:25,750 --> 01:48:27,750
apparently, I've got like a bright red bar right now.

1815
01:48:27,750 --> 01:48:30,949
Strangely enough.

1816
01:48:30,949 --> 01:48:32,949
More subs came in?

1817
01:48:32,949 --> 01:48:37,369
Goodness, thank you.

1818
01:48:37,369 --> 01:48:39,369
KD for the 20 more community subs.

1819
01:48:39,369 --> 01:48:41,859
Before that, too.

1820
01:48:41,859 --> 01:48:45,189
The ball of koala.

1821
01:48:45,189 --> 01:48:48,140
Was this 20?

1822
01:48:48,140 --> 01:48:53,579
Holy shit, guys.

1823
01:48:53,579 --> 01:48:55,579
This is like really fucked up right now.

1824
01:48:55,579 --> 01:49:00,869
I'm dropping like

1825
01:49:00,869 --> 01:49:02,869
so many frames at the moment.

1826
01:49:02,869 --> 01:49:06,460
Is it okay now?

1827
01:49:06,460 --> 01:49:11,060
I think it's alright now.

1828
01:49:11,060 --> 01:49:13,060
Might be one of those days, apparently.

1829
01:49:13,060 --> 01:49:16,649
For some reason.

1830
01:49:16,649 --> 01:49:18,649
That's like 200 fucking subs today.

1831
01:49:18,649 --> 01:49:20,649
150, something like that.

1832
01:49:20,649 --> 01:49:22,649
For community subs.

1833
01:49:22,649 --> 01:49:24,649
Ball of koala, KD.

1834
01:49:24,649 --> 01:49:29,750
Thank you both.

1835
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:32,310
Let's keep going.

1836
01:49:32,310 --> 01:49:34,550
Our wheel skunk.

1837
01:49:34,550 --> 01:49:36,550
I don't even know what the hell this thing is.

1838
01:49:36,550 --> 01:49:42,699
Alright, so today's the day, right?

1839
01:49:42,699 --> 01:49:45,640
No, no, no. Today's not the day.

1840
01:49:45,640 --> 01:49:47,640
Today we have a calendar.

1841
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:50,329
Here we go.

1842
01:49:50,329 --> 01:49:52,329
This is the one I'm signing up for.

1843
01:49:52,329 --> 01:49:54,329
Six battles.

1844
01:49:54,329 --> 01:49:56,329
Sign up for it. I want to be prepared for this.

1845
01:49:56,329 --> 01:49:58,819
So we got

1846
01:49:58,819 --> 01:50:00,819
a couple here.

1847
01:50:00,819 --> 01:50:02,819
We have one, two, three, four.

1848
01:50:02,819 --> 01:50:04,819
We've got about four or five weeks.

1849
01:50:04,819 --> 01:50:06,819
Let's rest up.

1850
01:50:06,819 --> 01:50:08,819
And get to D rank.

1851
01:50:08,819 --> 01:50:10,819
Hopefully we get there.

1852
01:50:10,819 --> 01:50:15,239
So let's start with

1853
01:50:15,239 --> 01:50:18,380
no, no, no. What's the schedule?

1854
01:50:18,380 --> 01:50:20,380
High jump, yeah.

1855
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:22,619
High jump, high jump, rest.

1856
01:50:22,619 --> 01:50:24,619
And then we're going to do exercise.

1857
01:50:24,619 --> 01:50:26,789
That sounds good.

1858
01:50:26,789 --> 01:50:28,789
Tournament's here.

1859
01:50:28,789 --> 01:50:30,789
Let's rest

1860
01:50:30,789 --> 01:50:33,029
here.

1861
01:50:33,029 --> 01:50:35,029
Work your

1862
01:50:35,029 --> 01:50:37,029
ass off for a couple days.

1863
01:50:37,029 --> 01:50:39,029
And then rest on the day of the tournament.

1864
01:50:39,029 --> 01:50:41,029
Alright, I think that's a good schedule.

1865
01:50:41,029 --> 01:50:43,029
Begin.

1866
01:50:43,029 --> 01:50:49,609
Plus ten speed, that's really good.

1867
01:50:49,609 --> 01:50:51,609
Let me see here.

1868
01:51:00,180 --> 01:51:03,189
Have a potato.

1869
01:51:05,689 --> 01:51:07,689
Twenty more community subs

1870
01:51:07,689 --> 01:51:09,689
from KD.

1871
01:51:09,689 --> 01:51:12,180
KD, what on earth?

1872
01:51:12,180 --> 01:51:16,220
Twenty more.

1873
01:51:16,220 --> 01:51:19,420
A hundred and fifteen total.

1874
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:21,420
Holy shit, dude.

1875
01:51:21,420 --> 01:51:23,779
Holy shit, dude.

1876
01:51:23,779 --> 01:51:27,300
That's a ton. Thank you so much

1877
01:51:27,300 --> 01:51:29,300
for the twenty more fucking community subs.

1878
01:51:29,300 --> 01:51:34,039
Holy shit.

1879
01:51:41,130 --> 01:51:43,130
I hate this

1880
01:51:43,130 --> 01:51:45,130
monster for no reason. Why?

1881
01:51:45,130 --> 01:51:49,989
Why do you hate this one?

1882
01:51:49,989 --> 01:52:06,439
I like this one.

1883
01:52:06,439 --> 01:52:08,439
I mean, it is kind of big on the screen,

1884
01:52:08,439 --> 01:52:10,939
but still.

1885
01:52:10,939 --> 01:52:12,939
You don't like

1886
01:52:12,939 --> 01:52:14,939
Smoochy from Death to Smoochy?

1887
01:52:14,939 --> 01:52:21,640
That's what it looks like.

1888
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:23,640
Alright, looks good. Let's go.

1889
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:32,869
Ten more speed.

1890
01:52:32,869 --> 01:52:34,869
He's very good with speed.

1891
01:52:34,869 --> 01:52:41,340
He's very, very

1892
01:52:41,340 --> 01:52:43,579
attentive to how fast he can go.

1893
01:52:43,579 --> 01:52:45,579
I mean, he does have a wheel, so that makes sense.

1894
01:52:48,970 --> 01:52:54,090
Alright, you can rest.

1895
01:52:54,090 --> 01:52:56,090
That's a boomer reference?

1896
01:52:56,090 --> 01:52:59,029
That's not a boomer reference.

1897
01:52:59,029 --> 01:53:03,300
How is that a boomer reference?

1898
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:05,300
It's like

1899
01:53:05,300 --> 01:53:07,300
a Danny DeVito movie.

1900
01:53:07,300 --> 01:53:09,300
I love Danny DeVito. He's still relevant.

1901
01:53:09,300 --> 01:53:15,770
Alright, rest, right?

1902
01:53:15,770 --> 01:53:17,770
No, rest here.

1903
01:53:17,770 --> 01:53:26,409
Sounds pretty good.

1904
01:53:26,409 --> 01:53:31,210
I'm ready. Go to sleep.

1905
01:53:31,210 --> 01:53:35,109
You skitch.

1906
01:53:35,109 --> 01:53:38,949
You just did the sloppy joke thing.

1907
01:53:38,949 --> 01:53:40,949
I love that lady. That's my favorite

1908
01:53:40,949 --> 01:53:45,369
character probably ever.

1909
01:53:45,369 --> 01:53:47,369
I know you skitch. Like a

1910
01:53:47,369 --> 01:53:50,380
sloppy.

1911
01:53:50,380 --> 01:53:56,899
Hey lady, you're scaring us. Billy Madison?

1912
01:53:56,899 --> 01:54:01,689
Come on.

1913
01:54:01,689 --> 01:54:04,630
The lady. The lunch lady

1914
01:54:04,630 --> 01:54:07,829
from Billy Madison.

1915
01:54:07,829 --> 01:54:09,829
Wow, I

1916
01:54:09,829 --> 01:54:12,460
am old apparently.

1917
01:54:12,460 --> 01:54:16,739
Alright, what do you need? Nothing?

1918
01:54:16,739 --> 01:54:18,739
No, you don't need food. You're good.

1919
01:54:18,739 --> 01:54:28,710
Somebody just said it took me

1920
01:54:28,710 --> 01:54:30,710
twenty days to finish

1921
01:54:30,710 --> 01:54:35,380
the Seaman book.

1922
01:54:35,380 --> 01:54:37,380
Why? Is that because

1923
01:54:37,380 --> 01:54:39,380
you didn't like it?

1924
01:54:39,380 --> 01:54:41,380
Were you forcing yourself

1925
01:54:41,380 --> 01:54:44,069
to watch it?

1926
01:54:44,069 --> 01:54:46,439
Keeping up the good work.

1927
01:54:46,439 --> 01:54:50,340
This guy just brings food.

1928
01:54:50,340 --> 01:54:52,340
Last game you had to buy food. I have a

1929
01:54:52,340 --> 01:54:55,220
surplus of food. This guy just keeps

1930
01:54:55,220 --> 01:54:57,220
bringing the same recipes every day.

1931
01:54:57,220 --> 01:54:59,220
Or every month. Or every like couple months.

1932
01:54:59,220 --> 01:55:03,829
I don't even know. Every season?

1933
01:55:03,829 --> 01:55:05,829
Twenty days. Alright, we got two trains

1934
01:55:05,829 --> 01:55:15,109
and then a rest. Or should I try to get

1935
01:55:15,109 --> 01:55:17,609
power to level ten?

1936
01:55:17,609 --> 01:55:19,609
Just go absolute fucking hammer.

1937
01:55:19,609 --> 01:55:25,369
What do you think?

1938
01:55:25,369 --> 01:55:29,340
Hmm. I think we're going to do

1939
01:55:29,340 --> 01:55:32,020
power again.

1940
01:55:32,020 --> 01:55:40,140
Yeah, I want to get to

1941
01:55:40,140 --> 01:55:42,140
level ten.

1942
01:55:42,140 --> 01:55:45,079
Rest, and then that's the official

1943
01:55:45,079 --> 01:55:47,319
tournament. Come on, level ten power.

1944
01:55:47,319 --> 01:55:51,479
Give me a new move. Yes!

1945
01:55:51,479 --> 01:55:55,640
New move. Give me a new move.

1946
01:55:55,640 --> 01:56:04,920
How do you learn new moves in this game?

1947
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:06,920
Yeah, no big deal. Just another

1948
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:08,920
twenty community subs from Katie.

1949
01:56:08,920 --> 01:56:12,359
Again. Twenty more.

1950
01:56:12,359 --> 01:56:17,350
Holy shit, man.

1951
01:56:17,350 --> 01:56:20,920
Twenty more.

1952
01:56:20,920 --> 01:56:23,159
Let's give him some food.

1953
01:56:23,159 --> 01:56:27,260
I can't. I can do it tomorrow.

1954
01:56:27,260 --> 01:56:29,260
Katie must have robbed a bank.

1955
01:56:29,260 --> 01:56:37,260
This game looks like Sekiro, but

1956
01:56:37,260 --> 01:56:41,930
good.

1957
01:56:43,930 --> 01:56:45,930
This game looks like Sekiro.

1958
01:56:45,930 --> 01:56:47,930
Five more from Katie.

1959
01:56:47,930 --> 01:56:50,550
Five more community subs

1960
01:56:50,550 --> 01:56:52,550
to top it all off.

1961
01:56:52,550 --> 01:56:58,119
Holy shit. Thank you, Katie.

1962
01:56:58,119 --> 01:57:04,329
His bank is going to

1963
01:57:04,329 --> 01:57:16,420
block his card.

1964
01:57:16,420 --> 01:57:18,840
Bill Gates.

1965
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:20,840
Some of you guys

1966
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:22,840
have given

1967
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:25,079
like extreme amounts

1968
01:57:25,079 --> 01:57:27,079
of money. How about some beef? Yeah!

1969
01:57:27,079 --> 01:57:30,920
Before the tournament,

1970
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:33,159
let's carb up. He didn't like that.

1971
01:57:33,159 --> 01:57:42,500
It's because he's a vegan.

1972
01:57:42,500 --> 01:57:45,579
Well, he's focused now. He's just having a rest.

1973
01:57:45,579 --> 01:57:48,649
He's fine. Yeah, he's ready to go, right?

1974
01:57:48,649 --> 01:57:50,649
Let's make sure.

1975
01:57:50,649 --> 01:57:53,140
Yeah. No, he's ready.

1976
01:57:53,140 --> 01:57:55,319
Let's go. First official

1977
01:57:55,319 --> 01:57:58,460
tournament. Six rivals.

1978
01:57:58,460 --> 01:58:00,460
A thousand dollars

1979
01:58:00,460 --> 01:58:02,460
for an item.

1980
01:58:02,460 --> 01:58:04,460
Official Grady. Let's move out of Grady.

1981
01:58:04,460 --> 01:58:11,050
Ten more subs from Jeremiah

1982
01:58:11,050 --> 01:58:14,180
about Minecraft VR. You guys

1983
01:58:14,180 --> 01:58:16,180
are just playing like sub-asteroids

1984
01:58:16,180 --> 01:58:19,960
right now with each other.

1985
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:26,039
Thank you, both of you. The official

1986
01:58:26,039 --> 01:58:28,039
grade rank E tournament. The winner of this

1987
01:58:28,039 --> 01:58:30,039
tournament will receive a voucher for rank D.

1988
01:58:30,039 --> 01:58:32,220
Let's give it our best.

1989
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:34,390
Begin the official grade rank E.

1990
01:58:34,390 --> 01:58:36,390
There we go.

1991
01:58:36,390 --> 01:58:39,590
Vroomer, Harris, Schmolet,

1992
01:58:39,590 --> 01:58:42,149
Judith, Lefort,

1993
01:58:42,149 --> 01:58:44,520
and Sunny.

1994
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:49,449
This is against Sunny.

1995
01:58:49,449 --> 01:58:51,449
Low intelligence, low accuracy.

1996
01:58:51,449 --> 01:58:54,840
Really high power and high

1997
01:58:54,840 --> 01:58:58,100
health. What about me?

1998
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:02,729
I've got really high power,

1999
01:59:02,729 --> 01:59:04,729
really kind of low

2000
01:59:04,729 --> 01:59:06,729
health. That's going to be the downfall

2001
01:59:06,729 --> 01:59:08,729
for me, I think. I've got to start to level that up.

2002
01:59:08,729 --> 01:59:11,739
And intelligence.

2003
01:59:11,739 --> 01:59:13,979
Alright.

2004
01:59:13,979 --> 01:59:17,430
What do you go for moves? High

2005
01:59:17,430 --> 01:59:19,430
power, so that means you want to be getting in.

2006
01:59:19,430 --> 01:59:21,430
Alright, he's got

2007
01:59:21,430 --> 01:59:24,699
a lot of moves. This is

2008
01:59:24,699 --> 01:59:27,189
going to be tough. Let's see if I can get a couple

2009
01:59:27,189 --> 01:59:40,819
of hits on him.

2010
01:59:40,819 --> 01:59:47,609
Okay.

2011
01:59:47,609 --> 01:59:49,609
You're dead. Your spine

2012
01:59:49,609 --> 01:59:53,770
is going to shatter. Why did I come up with

2013
01:59:53,770 --> 01:59:57,989
a pirate ship? Oh no, it's a

2014
01:59:57,989 --> 02:00:00,489
Sonic. It's Sunny the

2015
02:00:00,489 --> 02:00:04,779
Sonic dog.

2016
02:00:04,779 --> 02:00:07,079
This is some rivalry here.

2017
02:00:07,079 --> 02:00:13,399
Here we go. Start it off

2018
02:00:13,399 --> 02:00:16,859
quick.

2019
02:00:16,859 --> 02:00:19,539
Nice. Let me see if I can finish it with the

2020
02:00:19,539 --> 02:00:21,539
backspin.

2021
02:00:21,539 --> 02:00:27,539
Try it again.

2022
02:00:27,539 --> 02:00:31,829
Not good. Get in close.

2023
02:00:31,829 --> 02:00:35,159
Yes.

2024
02:00:35,159 --> 02:00:37,159
Final Guts.

2025
02:00:37,159 --> 02:00:39,159
What the fuck does that mean? What?

2026
02:00:39,159 --> 02:00:41,159
Oh, not good.

2027
02:00:41,159 --> 02:00:44,489
Thank god, he revived and I still got him.

2028
02:00:44,489 --> 02:00:51,079
Final Guts.

2029
02:00:51,079 --> 02:00:53,579
That's some weird technique.

2030
02:00:53,579 --> 02:00:57,739
He's going to be hard. Come back with one

2031
02:00:57,739 --> 02:01:01,260
health. Harris versus Lefort.

2032
02:01:01,260 --> 02:01:03,880
Lefort just beat

2033
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:06,250
Harris. 0-1.

2034
02:01:06,250 --> 02:01:09,319
These two. Judith and Smollett.

2035
02:01:09,319 --> 02:01:13,220
Pretty one-sided

2036
02:01:13,220 --> 02:01:17,000
fight there. Lefort and

2037
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Judith. Me, Lefort and Judith are the only

2038
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:24,180
ones that have wins.

2039
02:01:24,180 --> 02:01:26,180
That just went to

2040
02:01:26,180 --> 02:01:28,180
time, I think. Sunny wins.

2041
02:01:28,180 --> 02:01:31,640
Here we go. So now

2042
02:01:31,640 --> 02:01:33,640
we get to see one of these weirdos.

2043
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:36,199
Rumor versus Lefort.

2044
02:01:36,199 --> 02:01:38,199
Wrong thing.

2045
02:01:40,199 --> 02:01:43,779
That's a ton of intelligence.

2046
02:01:43,779 --> 02:01:45,779
I have to avoid all those int moves.

2047
02:01:45,779 --> 02:01:47,779
Jerma lied about Minecraft VR just gave

2048
02:01:47,779 --> 02:01:49,779
15 community subs. 10 and then 5.

2049
02:01:49,779 --> 02:01:53,159
More.

2050
02:01:53,159 --> 02:01:55,659
15 more subs.

2051
02:01:55,659 --> 02:01:58,789
Just dropping them everywhere.

2052
02:01:58,789 --> 02:02:00,789
You're just driving by in a blimp.

2053
02:02:00,789 --> 02:02:03,289
The two years, the three years

2054
02:02:03,289 --> 02:02:05,289
tonight. Or just slowly going by

2055
02:02:05,289 --> 02:02:07,289
in a blimp and throwing out like

2056
02:02:07,289 --> 02:02:09,289
ten dollar bills over like a crowd.

2057
02:02:09,289 --> 02:02:19,210
But then

2058
02:02:19,210 --> 02:02:21,210
I come in with a vacuum

2059
02:02:21,210 --> 02:02:23,449
and I

2060
02:02:23,449 --> 02:02:25,449
have a giant fucking Dr. Eggman

2061
02:02:25,449 --> 02:02:27,449
vacuum that I suck up all the money

2062
02:02:27,449 --> 02:02:29,449
and I stand at a podium and go

2063
02:02:29,449 --> 02:02:31,449
but here are emotes!

2064
02:02:31,449 --> 02:02:33,449
And everyone's like fucking screaming at me. That was

2065
02:02:33,449 --> 02:02:43,880
my fucking money!

2066
02:02:47,699 --> 02:02:49,699
Adventure Dan. Thank you Adventure MF Dan.

2067
02:02:49,699 --> 02:02:53,859
Stop taking

2068
02:02:53,859 --> 02:02:56,300
their money. This guy's

2069
02:02:56,300 --> 02:02:58,300
gonna kill us. I need to be

2070
02:02:58,300 --> 02:03:00,539
aware of this intelligent move.

2071
02:03:00,539 --> 02:03:02,539
The green moves try to stay away from me.

2072
02:03:02,539 --> 02:03:07,909
Thank you so much Adventure Dan.

2073
02:03:07,909 --> 02:03:11,939
Where's my fucking money, Dan?

2074
02:03:11,939 --> 02:03:15,659
Put on facecam?

2075
02:03:15,659 --> 02:03:18,090
Dude, I wish

2076
02:03:18,090 --> 02:03:21,800
we had one of these

2077
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:23,800
like pumpkin ducks. What is this?

2078
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:28,859
That's the weirdest thing

2079
02:03:28,859 --> 02:03:34,170
I've ever seen. Alright, intelligent

2080
02:03:34,170 --> 02:03:36,170
move is not on the list right now.

2081
02:03:36,170 --> 02:03:38,170
Let's see if we can get it.

2082
02:03:38,170 --> 02:03:40,859
Do it again. Not even a chance.

2083
02:03:43,100 --> 02:03:45,100
No, he blocked it with his

2084
02:03:45,100 --> 02:03:48,939
body. I'm gonna take a

2085
02:03:48,939 --> 02:03:50,939
hit here. Not just staying close.

2086
02:03:50,939 --> 02:03:52,939
He doesn't have a move close.

2087
02:03:52,939 --> 02:04:06,220
Goodbye.

2088
02:04:06,220 --> 02:04:16,260
Go back to Cuphead. Imagine

2089
02:04:16,260 --> 02:04:18,260
gifting subs in 2019.

2090
02:04:18,260 --> 02:04:20,260
Laughing my ass off. What?

2091
02:04:20,260 --> 02:04:26,409
I think Sunny's gonna be the one we have to fight

2092
02:04:26,409 --> 02:04:30,180
in the championship here.

2093
02:04:30,180 --> 02:04:33,000
It's all about the power. Alright, Judith.

2094
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
What do you got?

2095
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:38,840
An exceptionally

2096
02:04:38,840 --> 02:04:41,850
high intelligence.

2097
02:04:41,850 --> 02:04:43,850
To a point where I would probably get one shot

2098
02:04:43,850 --> 02:04:45,850
by any of the inf moves. What do you have

2099
02:04:45,850 --> 02:04:47,850
for intelligence moves though, that's the question.

2100
02:04:47,850 --> 02:04:52,069
Almost everything.

2101
02:04:52,069 --> 02:04:56,149
So,

2102
02:04:56,149 --> 02:04:58,520
all those green moves

2103
02:04:58,520 --> 02:05:01,399
are devastating to me. I have

2104
02:05:01,399 --> 02:05:03,399
to try to keep in the range of Windy Lance,

2105
02:05:03,399 --> 02:05:10,890
whatever it is.

2106
02:05:10,890 --> 02:05:12,890
Chunky Baloney, 50 bucks from

2107
02:05:12,890 --> 02:05:15,380
Chunky Baloney. Thank you for the 5,000

2108
02:05:15,380 --> 02:05:17,380
bits. Chunky Baloney.

2109
02:05:17,380 --> 02:05:19,819
I tried to donate this money to the local

2110
02:05:19,819 --> 02:05:21,819
animal shelter, but your vacuum sucked it up.

2111
02:05:21,819 --> 02:05:31,220
My, like, money vacuum.

2112
02:05:31,220 --> 02:05:38,840
Get in close.

2113
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:40,840
Everything she has is an intelligence. I gotta just try to end this

2114
02:05:40,840 --> 02:05:42,840
quick. No, this is bad.

2115
02:05:42,840 --> 02:05:47,619
All the way in the back.

2116
02:05:47,619 --> 02:05:49,619
She's got nothing, she's got no long range moves.

2117
02:05:49,619 --> 02:05:51,930
I only have a 27%

2118
02:05:51,930 --> 02:05:53,930
chance to hit with this. Holy shit, I got it.

2119
02:05:53,930 --> 02:05:56,359
This is just a Hail Mary right here, I have to do it.

2120
02:05:56,359 --> 02:06:01,930
Stay far away,

2121
02:06:01,930 --> 02:06:03,930
stay still, let me build up some guts.

2122
02:06:03,930 --> 02:06:05,930
Do it.

2123
02:06:05,930 --> 02:06:08,939
No! Alright,

2124
02:06:08,939 --> 02:06:13,739
get back in close, back in close.

2125
02:06:13,739 --> 02:06:16,869
In close again. Back it up, back it up, back it up.

2126
02:06:16,869 --> 02:06:18,869
I will do a war here.

2127
02:06:18,869 --> 02:06:21,300
No!

2128
02:06:21,300 --> 02:06:25,779
Get in close.

2129
02:06:25,779 --> 02:06:31,100
All it takes is one move.

2130
02:06:31,100 --> 02:06:34,680
No, shit!

2131
02:06:34,680 --> 02:06:37,109
Oh, I'm 18 seconds.

2132
02:06:37,109 --> 02:06:42,810
Oh, please.

2133
02:06:42,810 --> 02:06:48,439
Stay back, stay back.

2134
02:06:48,439 --> 02:06:50,869
Get in close.

2135
02:06:50,869 --> 02:06:52,869
Five, four,

2136
02:06:52,869 --> 02:06:54,869
three, two,

2137
02:06:54,869 --> 02:06:56,869
whoa! I win.

2138
02:06:56,869 --> 02:07:01,479
Wait, it's percentage based, right?

2139
02:07:01,479 --> 02:07:08,699
Yes.

2140
02:07:08,699 --> 02:07:10,699
Don't waste guts? Yeah, I just,

2141
02:07:10,699 --> 02:07:12,699
I saw the, I saw the

2142
02:07:12,699 --> 02:07:19,029
opportunity. 20 more subs

2143
02:07:19,029 --> 02:07:22,489
from Katie.

2144
02:07:22,489 --> 02:07:27,539
Oh my god.

2145
02:07:27,539 --> 02:07:29,539
Jesus Christ.

2146
02:07:29,539 --> 02:07:32,300
That's so many. I'm trying to have

2147
02:07:32,300 --> 02:07:34,300
everybody be a sub on the whole channel.

2148
02:07:34,300 --> 02:07:36,729
But thanks

2149
02:07:36,729 --> 02:07:38,729
Katie, that's a fucking extreme

2150
02:07:38,729 --> 02:07:42,949
amount of money. These

2151
02:07:42,949 --> 02:07:44,949
are the two, what's going to happen

2152
02:07:44,949 --> 02:07:53,079
here? Let's see, Ford's going to win.

2153
02:07:53,079 --> 02:08:03,960
Six hundred dollars.

2154
02:08:03,960 --> 02:08:07,220
That's a fucking ton of money.

2155
02:08:07,220 --> 02:08:09,220
We've seen some huge

2156
02:08:09,220 --> 02:08:11,220
sub and bit drops

2157
02:08:11,220 --> 02:08:13,220
on this channel and I can't fucking believe it every

2158
02:08:13,220 --> 02:08:17,000
time. Thank you guys.

2159
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:21,539
Harris versus Judith.

2160
02:08:21,539 --> 02:08:23,979
Now who's the, Sunny

2161
02:08:23,979 --> 02:08:25,979
Okay, let's see. If Sunny wins this fight

2162
02:08:25,979 --> 02:08:28,340
then

2163
02:08:28,340 --> 02:08:30,340
they're going to be the championship fighter.

2164
02:08:30,340 --> 02:08:33,979
And they just barely did.

2165
02:08:33,979 --> 02:08:36,409
Alright, so it's going to come down

2166
02:08:36,409 --> 02:08:38,409
to, I just can't lose. Smollett

2167
02:08:38,409 --> 02:08:40,409
has not won a single match.

2168
02:08:40,409 --> 02:08:42,710
This is going to be probably fairly easy.

2169
02:08:42,710 --> 02:08:45,590
I don't know why though,

2170
02:08:45,590 --> 02:08:49,239
look at this. These stats are actually

2171
02:08:49,239 --> 02:08:53,909
really good except for power.

2172
02:08:53,909 --> 02:08:55,909
Muahaha is one of their moves that's deadly.

2173
02:08:55,909 --> 02:08:57,909
Why would you lose every fight?

2174
02:08:57,909 --> 02:08:59,909
It's just the power?

2175
02:08:59,909 --> 02:09:17,380
That's not good at all.

2176
02:09:17,380 --> 02:09:20,520
Smollett. It's just a rabbit.

2177
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:25,260
See if I can one shot.

2178
02:09:25,260 --> 02:09:28,260
Whoa.

2179
02:09:28,260 --> 02:09:32,300
Okay.

2180
02:09:32,300 --> 02:09:35,369
Guts down

2181
02:09:35,369 --> 02:09:37,369
and I'll just do it back to back here.

2182
02:09:37,369 --> 02:09:40,500
High speed.

2183
02:09:40,500 --> 02:09:42,500
So it would be really easy to

2184
02:09:42,500 --> 02:09:44,500
only have 35% chance to win here.

2185
02:09:44,500 --> 02:09:46,939
Oh yeah,

2186
02:09:46,939 --> 02:09:48,939
you're terrible.

2187
02:09:48,939 --> 02:09:52,779
You're awful.

2188
02:09:52,779 --> 02:09:57,380
23 damage.

2189
02:09:57,380 --> 02:09:59,380
My defense isn't even that good.

2190
02:09:59,380 --> 02:10:03,909
Alright, LeFort, beat him.

2191
02:10:03,909 --> 02:10:10,739
Let's see.

2192
02:10:10,739 --> 02:10:13,750
Smollett just

2193
02:10:13,750 --> 02:10:15,750
destroyed Harris. That means Harris

2194
02:10:15,750 --> 02:10:19,140
is, I guess they both

2195
02:10:19,140 --> 02:10:21,140
pretty bad so it doesn't matter.

2196
02:10:21,140 --> 02:10:26,180
Close.

2197
02:10:26,180 --> 02:10:29,579
Alright, Harris. This is a guaranteed

2198
02:10:29,579 --> 02:10:31,579
championship if I win.

2199
02:10:31,579 --> 02:10:33,819
No it's not. If Sonny wins his

2200
02:10:33,819 --> 02:10:35,819
next match. No, I mean it pretty much is.

2201
02:10:35,819 --> 02:10:38,699
Let's see what we got.

2202
02:10:38,699 --> 02:10:42,020
Nothing really spectacular.

2203
02:10:42,020 --> 02:10:44,020
Welcome to Germacraft.

2204
02:10:44,020 --> 02:10:50,039
Why Germacraft?

2205
02:10:50,039 --> 02:10:56,869
I like those little Loch Ness

2206
02:10:56,869 --> 02:10:58,869
monsters. I want one of these.

2207
02:10:58,869 --> 02:11:01,109
Okay, we got

2208
02:11:01,109 --> 02:11:07,180
50% chance to hit here.

2209
02:11:07,180 --> 02:11:13,640
Uh oh.

2210
02:11:13,640 --> 02:11:22,149
That was embarrassing.

2211
02:11:22,149 --> 02:11:26,420
That was embarrassing.

2212
02:11:26,420 --> 02:11:28,420
Didn't even do anything.

2213
02:11:28,420 --> 02:11:33,159
I feel bad. Can I buy

2214
02:11:33,159 --> 02:11:35,159
Harris from this trainer?

2215
02:11:35,159 --> 02:11:37,159
I feel like I would take better care of Harris.

2216
02:11:37,159 --> 02:11:39,159
The winner is

2217
02:11:39,159 --> 02:11:43,770
the winner is Vroomer

2218
02:11:43,770 --> 02:11:51,770
moving on to Class D.

2219
02:11:51,770 --> 02:11:56,819
He's trying his best. Yeah.

2220
02:11:56,819 --> 02:11:58,819
Thousand gold. Prize carrot.

2221
02:11:58,819 --> 02:12:01,319
More fame. Vroomer is now

2222
02:12:01,319 --> 02:12:09,260
climbing the ranks. New monster?

2223
02:12:09,260 --> 02:12:14,630
You can train up to four in your

2224
02:12:14,630 --> 02:12:16,630
ranch. I think I might have to unlock

2225
02:12:16,630 --> 02:12:18,939
that though. You won the official

2226
02:12:18,939 --> 02:12:21,300
competition. Well, I guess

2227
02:12:21,300 --> 02:12:24,310
my work is done. Well you

2228
02:12:24,310 --> 02:12:27,060
done? What do you mean, Yuri?

2229
02:12:27,060 --> 02:12:29,300
Well, my father wants me to come back

2230
02:12:29,300 --> 02:12:31,300
and work at the store. I

2231
02:12:31,300 --> 02:12:33,300
decided I would quit if you won the competition.

2232
02:12:33,300 --> 02:12:38,739
That doesn't make any sense.

2233
02:12:38,739 --> 02:12:41,560
Sorry I didn't tell you before.

2234
02:12:41,560 --> 02:12:43,560
I wanted to beat TT before

2235
02:12:43,560 --> 02:12:45,560
I quit. It's been a lot of fun really.

2236
02:12:45,560 --> 02:12:48,180
I see. But wait, you mean I have to

2237
02:12:48,180 --> 02:12:50,180
take care of the ranch by myself?

2238
02:12:50,180 --> 02:12:53,829
Hee hee. Don't you worry, partner.

2239
02:12:53,829 --> 02:12:55,829
I've got my replacement lined up and she's

2240
02:12:55,829 --> 02:12:58,460
here. There you go.

2241
02:12:58,460 --> 02:13:01,850
Don't be shy. Come on out now.

2242
02:13:01,850 --> 02:13:04,220
Hi. Er. Hello.

2243
02:13:04,220 --> 02:13:06,220
Huh? Is that you, Rio?

2244
02:13:06,220 --> 02:13:08,579
Yup. Doesn't she

2245
02:13:08,579 --> 02:13:10,579
look different? I was amazed too.

2246
02:13:10,579 --> 02:13:13,779
What do you mean different? She has her hair in a ponytail.

2247
02:13:13,779 --> 02:13:18,630
Really?

2248
02:13:18,630 --> 02:13:20,630
I figured it would be easier to work with

2249
02:13:20,630 --> 02:13:22,630
this outfit. Does it look alright?

2250
02:13:22,630 --> 02:13:27,029
What's the difference? Of course

2251
02:13:27,029 --> 02:13:29,720
it looks great. So check this

2252
02:13:29,720 --> 02:13:31,720
out. When I told Caesar I'd be moving

2253
02:13:31,720 --> 02:13:33,720
on from my assistant position,

2254
02:13:33,720 --> 02:13:35,720
Rio said she wanted to take over.

2255
02:13:35,720 --> 02:13:38,149
Gosh. I was totally

2256
02:13:38,149 --> 02:13:40,460
surprised. Wow, really?

2257
02:13:40,460 --> 02:13:42,460
So it's okay then, right?

2258
02:13:42,460 --> 02:13:44,460
You be a good girl, Rio.

2259
02:13:44,460 --> 02:13:47,529
I always wanted to

2260
02:13:47,529 --> 02:13:49,529
raise monsters on a ranch.

2261
02:13:49,529 --> 02:13:52,149
When I heard about Yuri,

2262
02:13:52,149 --> 02:13:54,460
I thought this is my

2263
02:13:54,460 --> 02:13:57,340
chance. This is my chance?

2264
02:13:57,340 --> 02:13:59,340
Well, you said it. This is our chance.

2265
02:13:59,340 --> 02:14:02,859
Yup. Our chance.

2266
02:14:02,859 --> 02:14:10,409
What a good boy. Who's a good boy?

2267
02:14:10,409 --> 02:14:12,409
Who's a good boy?

2268
02:14:12,409 --> 02:14:15,989
Who's a good boy? Yes, you are.

2269
02:14:15,989 --> 02:14:23,140
Uh, let's save the

2270
02:14:23,140 --> 02:14:25,140
game before I have a panic

2271
02:14:25,140 --> 02:14:27,140
attack meltdown when it doesn't

2272
02:14:27,140 --> 02:14:29,140
happen and the game crashes or something.

2273
02:14:39,189 --> 02:14:41,189
Please end this stream forever. Why?

2274
02:14:41,189 --> 02:14:44,520
End it.

2275
02:14:44,520 --> 02:14:46,520
Okay, so how...

2276
02:14:46,520 --> 02:14:48,520
Let's go to the shrine. Can I...

2277
02:14:48,520 --> 02:14:50,520
I want to... Let's get a new monster.

2278
02:14:50,520 --> 02:14:55,899
Let's do it. Everything going well.

2279
02:14:55,899 --> 02:14:57,899
What will it be? Create.

2280
02:14:57,899 --> 02:14:59,899
You already have a

2281
02:14:59,899 --> 02:15:01,899
monster you are raising.

2282
02:15:01,899 --> 02:15:04,390
What will it be?

2283
02:15:04,390 --> 02:15:06,390
Yeah, how do... Somebody said I could...

2284
02:15:06,390 --> 02:15:08,569
One guy told me that

2285
02:15:08,569 --> 02:15:10,569
I could do four. Do I need to...

2286
02:15:10,569 --> 02:15:12,569
I might have to get to a certain rank?

2287
02:15:12,569 --> 02:15:18,329
I need to unlock the bigger ranch.

2288
02:15:18,329 --> 02:15:20,329
Alright, well then, rumor's going to take us to the top and then from there

2289
02:15:20,329 --> 02:15:22,329
we're going to get more.

2290
02:15:22,329 --> 02:15:26,619
This is the next, like, six to

2291
02:15:26,619 --> 02:15:28,619
ten weeks worth of streams, guys, so...

2292
02:15:33,270 --> 02:15:35,270
Alright, let me take a look at

2293
02:15:35,270 --> 02:15:38,600
what we need to work on here.

2294
02:15:38,600 --> 02:15:41,100
Power's good.

2295
02:15:41,100 --> 02:15:45,770
Accuracy could use some work.

2296
02:15:45,770 --> 02:15:47,770
Everything... Intelligence could use some work.

2297
02:15:47,770 --> 02:15:49,770
But I want 200

2298
02:15:49,770 --> 02:15:51,770
attack power. I want more accuracy. He's...

2299
02:15:51,770 --> 02:15:53,770
I don't like the 50% bullshit.

2300
02:15:53,770 --> 02:15:55,770
I don't know a lot about Minecraft VR.

2301
02:15:55,770 --> 02:15:57,770
Ten community...

2302
02:15:57,770 --> 02:16:04,229
more community subs.

2303
02:16:04,229 --> 02:16:06,920
Back to back they keep coming back and forth here.

2304
02:16:06,920 --> 02:16:10,939
Thank you.

2305
02:16:10,939 --> 02:16:13,689
I haven't trained any life at all either.

2306
02:16:13,689 --> 02:16:16,630
I know. It's true.

2307
02:16:16,630 --> 02:16:18,630
It's too much to think about.

2308
02:16:18,630 --> 02:16:23,109
Let's get a good schedule here then.

2309
02:16:23,109 --> 02:16:25,420
Alright, I want...

2310
02:16:25,420 --> 02:16:27,420
Let's do...

2311
02:16:27,420 --> 02:16:29,420
I'm going to do

2312
02:16:29,420 --> 02:16:31,420
accuracy and life.

2313
02:16:31,420 --> 02:16:33,420
Back and forth here.

2314
02:16:36,870 --> 02:16:38,870
Day of rest.

2315
02:16:41,799 --> 02:16:46,600
Let's see how we go from there.

2316
02:16:48,600 --> 02:16:52,569
Accuracy.

2317
02:16:54,569 --> 02:16:56,569
Not good, but not great.

2318
02:16:58,569 --> 02:17:12,440
I'm going to scold. I mean,

2319
02:17:12,440 --> 02:17:14,440
we've been very, very, very...

2320
02:17:16,440 --> 02:17:18,440
Focus is not that great either.

2321
02:17:20,440 --> 02:17:23,239
Yeah, I know.

2322
02:17:23,239 --> 02:17:26,170
Look, we've been very, very

2323
02:17:26,170 --> 02:17:28,170
nice.

2324
02:17:28,170 --> 02:17:30,170
We've praised every time.

2325
02:17:30,170 --> 02:17:32,170
Don't want the monster to get

2326
02:17:32,170 --> 02:17:34,409
to a point where they're, you know,

2327
02:17:34,409 --> 02:17:36,649
getting lazy or anything.

2328
02:17:36,649 --> 02:17:38,649
Hello there.

2329
02:17:38,649 --> 02:17:44,020
Hello Yuri. What brings you here?

2330
02:17:44,020 --> 02:17:46,579
Well, actually, there's somebody I want to introduce.

2331
02:17:46,579 --> 02:17:49,270
To you. He's right over here.

2332
02:17:49,270 --> 02:17:51,770
Hello.

2333
02:17:51,770 --> 02:17:54,649
My name is Todd. I'm a monster

2334
02:17:54,649 --> 02:17:56,649
venerarian.

2335
02:17:56,649 --> 02:17:58,649
I'm traveling around

2336
02:17:58,649 --> 02:18:00,649
checking the health of monsters.

2337
02:18:00,649 --> 02:18:02,649
Oh, nice to meet you.

2338
02:18:02,649 --> 02:18:05,979
Todd came all the way from the

2339
02:18:05,979 --> 02:18:08,469
faraway island of age.

2340
02:18:08,469 --> 02:18:10,469
He's traveling the world for the sake of

2341
02:18:10,469 --> 02:18:12,840
monsters everywhere.

2342
02:18:12,840 --> 02:18:15,399
All around the world, that's incredible.

2343
02:18:15,399 --> 02:18:17,399
Please, it's not that big of a deal.

2344
02:18:17,399 --> 02:18:19,959
Oops, I'm sorry. I interrupted your monster caretaking.

2345
02:18:19,959 --> 02:18:21,959
No, it's no problem at all.

2346
02:18:21,959 --> 02:18:24,459
But then I'll be heading to the other

2347
02:18:24,459 --> 02:18:27,530
ranches. Goodbye, bye.

2348
02:18:27,530 --> 02:18:29,530
If you're ever in the neighborhood, I can't help you.

2349
02:18:29,530 --> 02:18:31,899
If you're ever in the neighborhood, I can't

2350
02:18:31,899 --> 02:18:34,200
please feel free to stop by.

2351
02:18:34,200 --> 02:18:39,059
Okay, goodbye. What a nice person.

2352
02:18:39,059 --> 02:18:41,059
I can sense his love for monsters.

2353
02:18:41,059 --> 02:18:43,559
So there are other people in the world like

2354
02:18:43,559 --> 02:18:46,500
Fane, aren't there? I gotta get out of here.

2355
02:18:46,500 --> 02:18:52,579
I gotta go.

2356
02:18:52,579 --> 02:18:54,579
This ranch is just like I expected it would be.

2357
02:18:54,579 --> 02:18:56,579
Hello, anybody home?

2358
02:18:56,579 --> 02:18:58,579
Yeah, I'm the

2359
02:18:58,579 --> 02:19:01,139
breeder at this ranch. Who are you?

2360
02:19:01,139 --> 02:19:03,139
Excuse me, I'm Pollock. I'm a training

2361
02:19:03,139 --> 02:19:05,700
gadget peddler. Training

2362
02:19:05,700 --> 02:19:08,200
gadget? I saw your battle

2363
02:19:08,200 --> 02:19:10,200
in the competition the other day. I guess you're

2364
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:12,200
not using training gadgets. I could tell.

2365
02:19:12,200 --> 02:19:14,629
Wait, just a minute here.

2366
02:19:14,629 --> 02:19:16,629
What the heck is a training gadget?

2367
02:19:16,629 --> 02:19:18,870
Oh, sorry. There's a fucking fifty

2368
02:19:18,870 --> 02:19:20,870
community subs just came in. Somebody

2369
02:19:20,870 --> 02:19:22,870
just blasted out like

2370
02:19:22,870 --> 02:19:25,940
a thousand dollars.

2371
02:19:25,940 --> 02:19:28,700
Hold on one minute.

2372
02:19:28,700 --> 02:19:30,700
KD just gave fifty community subs.

2373
02:19:30,700 --> 02:19:36,760
Fifty community

2374
02:19:36,760 --> 02:19:41,430
subs. Oh my god.

2375
02:19:41,430 --> 02:19:44,250
How many have you

2376
02:19:44,250 --> 02:19:46,250
given tonight? Let me see.

2377
02:19:46,250 --> 02:19:54,040
Quick math.

2378
02:19:54,040 --> 02:19:59,540
Holy shit, man. One guy

2379
02:19:59,540 --> 02:20:01,540
aims to gift all.

2380
02:20:01,540 --> 02:20:09,079
Thank you. For the

2381
02:20:09,079 --> 02:20:11,639
fucking, I don't even

2382
02:20:11,639 --> 02:20:15,860
that's a lot.

2383
02:20:15,860 --> 02:20:17,860
Vacuum is overloaded. I gotta, I have to like

2384
02:20:17,860 --> 02:20:25,350
empty the vacuum. Thank you

2385
02:20:25,350 --> 02:20:29,700
so much, man. Oh, sorry, Charlie.

2386
02:20:29,700 --> 02:20:32,260
I'll stop there.

2387
02:20:32,260 --> 02:20:34,260
Training gadgets? Oh, well

2388
02:20:34,260 --> 02:20:36,260
gadgets that you use for training.

2389
02:20:36,260 --> 02:20:38,569
In other words, they're machines that

2390
02:20:38,569 --> 02:20:40,569
boost effective training. Everybody

2391
02:20:40,569 --> 02:20:43,059
uses them. And you, my friend,

2392
02:20:43,059 --> 02:20:45,750
have great potential. Why don't you try

2393
02:20:45,750 --> 02:20:47,750
using the training gadget on your ranch?

2394
02:20:47,750 --> 02:20:49,750
You'll soon be seeing even better results.

2395
02:20:49,750 --> 02:20:52,180
Well, I'll come again later. Bye.

2396
02:20:52,180 --> 02:20:56,219
Hmm. Using machines

2397
02:20:56,219 --> 02:20:58,219
for training. What do you think, Rio?

2398
02:20:58,219 --> 02:21:04,729
I'm gonna change

2399
02:21:04,729 --> 02:21:08,059
it to this. Training gadgets

2400
02:21:08,059 --> 02:21:10,809
run off Geonite.

2401
02:21:10,809 --> 02:21:12,809
Geonite is an energy of the earth found in

2402
02:21:12,809 --> 02:21:14,809
spirit trees. Eddie?

2403
02:21:14,809 --> 02:21:16,809
It's found in spirit trees, Eddie.

2404
02:21:16,809 --> 02:21:20,329
So you mean gadgets

2405
02:21:20,329 --> 02:21:22,329
use energy from

2406
02:21:22,329 --> 02:21:27,129
Makroji, Eddie?

2407
02:21:27,129 --> 02:21:29,129
Don't worry, I'm old enough to have saved a plenty

2408
02:21:29,129 --> 02:21:31,129
of extra Geonite.

2409
02:21:31,129 --> 02:21:34,709
Makroji, don't over-exert yourself.

2410
02:21:34,709 --> 02:21:37,659
It's decided then.

2411
02:21:37,659 --> 02:21:39,659
Let's try using training gadgets

2412
02:21:39,659 --> 02:21:44,010
on our ranch.

2413
02:21:44,010 --> 02:21:46,010
Quick refund to all the gift subs.

2414
02:21:46,010 --> 02:21:48,010
Well,

2415
02:21:48,010 --> 02:21:50,010
hello. Wrong guy.

2416
02:21:50,010 --> 02:21:52,379
Well, hello.

2417
02:21:52,379 --> 02:21:54,379
They're doing well? Have you decided?

2418
02:21:54,379 --> 02:21:56,379
I can't, there's only so many anime fucking

2419
02:21:56,379 --> 02:21:58,379
dub voices I know. I don't know any others.

2420
02:21:58,379 --> 02:22:00,379
I know like four.

2421
02:22:00,379 --> 02:22:03,319
Have you decided to try using

2422
02:22:03,319 --> 02:22:05,319
training gadgets? I feel like I'm

2423
02:22:05,319 --> 02:22:07,319
stuck in a time portal.

2424
02:22:07,319 --> 02:22:10,260
Just give it to me.

2425
02:22:10,260 --> 02:22:12,260
You really ought to give them a try. Feel free to take a look at them.

2426
02:22:12,260 --> 02:22:17,129
What will you do?

2427
02:22:17,129 --> 02:22:19,559
I don't know what these are.

2428
02:22:19,559 --> 02:22:23,139
Pinman just gave ten community subs.

2429
02:22:23,139 --> 02:22:25,139
Thank you Pinman for ten community subs.

2430
02:22:25,139 --> 02:22:27,319
By training

2431
02:22:27,319 --> 02:22:30,010
effect?

2432
02:22:30,010 --> 02:22:32,629
You don't have any appraised training gadgets.

2433
02:22:32,629 --> 02:22:36,540
But thank you so much Pinman.

2434
02:22:36,540 --> 02:22:38,540
What will you do? By training.

2435
02:22:38,540 --> 02:22:41,290
What will you buy?

2436
02:22:41,290 --> 02:22:44,420
Oh, look at this.

2437
02:22:44,420 --> 02:22:47,180
Look at this.

2438
02:22:47,180 --> 02:22:49,610
Two thousand gold. Strength training.

2439
02:22:49,610 --> 02:22:51,610
Get level two. Space one by two.

2440
02:22:51,610 --> 02:22:54,229
Ooh.

2441
02:22:54,229 --> 02:22:56,860
Alright, alright.

2442
02:22:56,860 --> 02:22:59,030
Okay.

2443
02:22:59,030 --> 02:23:01,030
I'm thinking, uh, how much

2444
02:23:01,030 --> 02:23:03,399
do they cost?

2445
02:23:03,399 --> 02:23:05,399
They're like two thousand each. I got thirteen thousand?

2446
02:23:05,399 --> 02:23:12,120
Dude, Ruby the dog.

2447
02:23:12,120 --> 02:23:14,489
I'll try to do Ruby the dog.

2448
02:23:14,489 --> 02:23:16,489
No.

2449
02:23:16,489 --> 02:23:18,489
No Ruby.

2450
02:23:18,489 --> 02:23:20,489
It's me, Ruby.

2451
02:23:20,489 --> 02:23:22,489
Got it.

2452
02:23:22,489 --> 02:23:26,010
I'm gonna go, I want

2453
02:23:26,010 --> 02:23:28,010
this one.

2454
02:23:28,010 --> 02:23:33,500
Buy this. Yes.

2455
02:23:33,500 --> 02:23:35,500
Thank you very much.

2456
02:23:35,500 --> 02:23:37,500
Customize immediately. Uh, sure.

2457
02:23:37,500 --> 02:23:39,860
Oh, I have to place it.

2458
02:23:39,860 --> 02:23:44,469
Wait, what?

2459
02:23:44,469 --> 02:23:46,780
Poor house,

2460
02:23:46,780 --> 02:23:48,780
poor hut.

2461
02:23:48,780 --> 02:23:52,299
Oh, my God.

2462
02:23:52,299 --> 02:23:56,629
This is huge.

2463
02:23:56,629 --> 02:23:58,629
Um.

2464
02:23:58,629 --> 02:24:01,770
Poor streamer.

2465
02:24:01,770 --> 02:24:04,069
Not tonight.

2466
02:24:04,069 --> 02:24:09,510
Alright, then.

2467
02:24:09,510 --> 02:24:11,510
Alright, we're gonna use that.

2468
02:24:11,510 --> 02:24:17,899
Anything else to buy?

2469
02:24:17,899 --> 02:24:19,899
Um, yeah.

2470
02:24:19,899 --> 02:24:22,389
You guys are out of your minds.

2471
02:24:22,389 --> 02:24:24,389
Studley Do-Right gave twenty

2472
02:24:24,389 --> 02:24:31,180
community subs.

2473
02:24:31,180 --> 02:24:33,180
Holy shit, guys.

2474
02:24:33,180 --> 02:24:37,020
I'm spoiled rotten.

2475
02:24:37,020 --> 02:24:43,100
Uh, what about speed trampoline?

2476
02:24:43,100 --> 02:24:45,530
Is one by one?

2477
02:24:45,530 --> 02:24:48,280
I can do that, right?

2478
02:24:48,280 --> 02:24:50,280
No, it's not. I can't. Can I?

2479
02:24:50,280 --> 02:24:54,440
But thank you so much.

2480
02:24:54,440 --> 02:24:58,659
I'm buying the speed one.

2481
02:24:58,659 --> 02:25:03,139
I think I can fit this.

2482
02:25:03,139 --> 02:25:05,139
It's one by one, right?

2483
02:25:07,139 --> 02:25:09,139
Yeah. Trampoline?

2484
02:25:09,139 --> 02:25:11,139
Any more one by ones?

2485
02:25:11,139 --> 02:25:19,510
This is one by two.

2486
02:25:19,510 --> 02:25:22,389
One by two.

2487
02:25:22,389 --> 02:25:24,389
Two by three. One by one.

2488
02:25:24,389 --> 02:25:26,389
One by two. No.

2489
02:25:26,389 --> 02:25:29,719
Alright, what else you got?

2490
02:25:29,719 --> 02:25:31,719
Sell?

2491
02:25:31,719 --> 02:25:34,540
What will you sell? Can I sell my house?

2492
02:25:34,540 --> 02:25:37,540
Uh, Adventure MFDan

2493
02:25:37,540 --> 02:25:39,540
five more subs.

2494
02:25:39,540 --> 02:25:42,420
Five more subs.

2495
02:25:42,420 --> 02:25:44,420
From MFDan.

2496
02:25:44,420 --> 02:25:50,059
Money laundering stream.

2497
02:25:52,420 --> 02:25:55,110
Holy shit.

2498
02:25:55,110 --> 02:25:58,739
Alright, so now.

2499
02:26:00,739 --> 02:26:02,920
Let's see. That was speed and

2500
02:26:02,920 --> 02:26:04,920
accuracy.

2501
02:26:04,920 --> 02:26:07,420
Let's go to the schedule.

2502
02:26:07,420 --> 02:26:09,420
This is speed and accuracy, right?

2503
02:26:12,040 --> 02:26:14,469
Yeah. Shadow box is accuracy

2504
02:26:14,469 --> 02:26:16,469
and balance is speed.

2505
02:26:16,469 --> 02:26:18,469
I believe.

2506
02:26:18,469 --> 02:26:20,469
No. Oh, look at this!

2507
02:26:25,860 --> 02:26:28,360
Target.

2508
02:26:28,360 --> 02:26:31,180
Very cool.

2509
02:26:33,180 --> 02:26:35,420
Target and then

2510
02:26:37,780 --> 02:26:39,780
Trampoline.

2511
02:26:39,780 --> 02:26:41,780
Target, trampoline, rest, trampoline.

2512
02:26:41,780 --> 02:26:44,409
Got it.

2513
02:26:44,409 --> 02:26:46,409
I'm excited for this one.

2514
02:26:46,409 --> 02:26:48,409
We actually get to see them do a different animation.

2515
02:26:48,409 --> 02:26:59,139
Nice.

2516
02:26:59,139 --> 02:27:01,139
So you have to build up your ranch and they can

2517
02:27:01,139 --> 02:27:03,139
use... This is cool.

2518
02:27:03,139 --> 02:27:08,260
Nice work. Alright, you're very tired though

2519
02:27:08,260 --> 02:27:12,549
and very hungry.

2520
02:27:12,549 --> 02:27:14,549
Uh, food. Let's give you some...

2521
02:27:14,549 --> 02:27:21,510
Let's give you a mango.

2522
02:27:21,510 --> 02:27:24,520
I love mangoes.

2523
02:27:24,520 --> 02:27:27,340
Frustrated? Well, you'll be fine.

2524
02:27:27,340 --> 02:27:35,399
Vroomer is cute. Vroomer seems to be

2525
02:27:35,399 --> 02:27:37,399
a little worried about something.

2526
02:27:37,399 --> 02:27:40,090
Hmm, I wonder what's wrong. Oh,

2527
02:27:40,090 --> 02:27:42,260
Caesar!

2528
02:28:07,059 --> 02:28:09,059
In the hut, things might get exciting around here.

2529
02:28:09,059 --> 02:28:12,329
It should be fun.

2530
02:28:12,329 --> 02:28:14,329
But with more monsters,

2531
02:28:14,329 --> 02:28:16,329
you may have to expand the ranch itself.

2532
02:28:16,329 --> 02:28:18,329
How about this? I'll ask a carpenter

2533
02:28:18,329 --> 02:28:20,329
friend of mine. He should be able

2534
02:28:20,329 --> 02:28:22,329
to get working on something right away.

2535
02:28:22,329 --> 02:28:25,270
Carpenter?

2536
02:28:25,270 --> 02:28:27,450
But we don't...

2537
02:28:27,450 --> 02:28:29,690
We don't have any money.

2538
02:28:29,690 --> 02:28:31,690
Oh boy, could you stop acting like a stranger?

2539
02:28:31,690 --> 02:28:34,059
I know this will put a smile

2540
02:28:34,059 --> 02:28:36,059
on your face and to me that's worth more

2541
02:28:36,059 --> 02:28:39,260
than anything in the world.

2542
02:28:39,260 --> 02:28:41,879
Father, thank you.

2543
02:28:41,879 --> 02:28:43,879
Well, then it's settled. Leave the rest to me.

2544
02:28:43,879 --> 02:28:53,530
Ciao.

2545
02:28:53,530 --> 02:28:57,239
That's good.

2546
02:28:57,239 --> 02:28:59,860
So now we get to make more monsters.

2547
02:28:59,860 --> 02:29:08,059
Dude, what an

2548
02:29:08,059 --> 02:29:11,379
epic November fail.

2549
02:29:11,379 --> 02:29:13,379
Hello there, partner. Is Fane home?

2550
02:29:13,379 --> 02:29:15,690
Fane, it's me. But who are you?

2551
02:29:15,690 --> 02:29:18,250
Me? I don't know the name to you.

2552
02:29:18,250 --> 02:29:21,000
I'm the carpenter that Caesar hired.

2553
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
You're the carpenter?

2554
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,559
You betcha I am.

2555
02:29:25,559 --> 02:29:27,559
No, don't you worry about a thing. Leave it all to

2556
02:29:27,559 --> 02:29:29,559
you. To leave it to me?

2557
02:29:29,559 --> 02:29:31,860
No, you.

2558
02:29:31,860 --> 02:29:33,860
What?

2559
02:29:33,860 --> 02:29:35,860
Okay, we's got us a ranch, a hut

2560
02:29:35,860 --> 02:29:39,450
and a rickety house.

2561
02:29:39,450 --> 02:29:41,450
Okay, we'll have you a brand new ranch in one week.

2562
02:29:41,450 --> 02:29:51,540
What? Er, thanks.

2563
02:29:51,540 --> 02:29:54,170
In one week we have a new ranch.

2564
02:29:54,170 --> 02:29:56,170
Oh, I'm so fucking

2565
02:29:56,170 --> 02:29:58,170
excited now. Alright.

2566
02:29:58,170 --> 02:30:00,469
Frustrated.

2567
02:30:00,469 --> 02:30:02,469
Maybe you should jump on a trampoline.

2568
02:30:02,469 --> 02:30:08,299
Plus 10

2569
02:30:08,299 --> 02:30:10,299
every time you do that. 60% success rate.

2570
02:30:10,299 --> 02:30:13,559
Alright, what's your favorite food?

2571
02:30:13,559 --> 02:30:16,569
You don't have to do that with

2572
02:30:16,569 --> 02:30:18,569
the tire. You can do it

2573
02:30:18,569 --> 02:30:21,379
somewhere else. Alright,

2574
02:30:21,379 --> 02:30:23,879
let's give you...

2575
02:30:23,879 --> 02:30:26,440
What do I have? I have no items to give.

2576
02:30:26,440 --> 02:30:29,559
You're doing a great job.

2577
02:30:29,559 --> 02:30:33,719
Does the wheel feel pain?

2578
02:30:33,719 --> 02:30:36,020
I don't know.

2579
02:30:36,020 --> 02:30:38,020
I mean, the wheel is part of him.

2580
02:30:38,020 --> 02:30:42,250
Alright, good job,

2581
02:30:42,250 --> 02:30:44,250
Brumer. Take the week off.

2582
02:30:49,559 --> 02:30:59,659
Alrighty, boys, that'll do it.

2583
02:30:59,659 --> 02:31:01,659
Well, what do you think?

2584
02:31:01,659 --> 02:31:03,659
Gives you a lot of space, huh?

2585
02:31:03,659 --> 02:31:05,829
Wow, you, you're just

2586
02:31:05,829 --> 02:31:07,829
my age. But you direct all those

2587
02:31:07,829 --> 02:31:09,829
adults around like a true leader.

2588
02:31:09,829 --> 02:31:12,260
Yeah, so cool.

2589
02:31:12,260 --> 02:31:14,819
Oh, give me a break. I'm just doing

2590
02:31:14,819 --> 02:31:17,260
my job. Now three

2591
02:31:17,260 --> 02:31:19,260
monsters can live in the hut and you can

2592
02:31:19,260 --> 02:31:21,260
store more gadgets in the house.

2593
02:31:21,260 --> 02:31:23,559
So where would you like to

2594
02:31:23,559 --> 02:31:25,559
put the house and hut? I'll place it wherever you like.

2595
02:31:27,739 --> 02:31:29,739
Look at this real estate.

2596
02:31:29,739 --> 02:31:31,739
Just fucking so big.

2597
02:31:31,739 --> 02:31:33,739
Alright, this is what we need.

2598
02:31:33,739 --> 02:31:35,739
Normal house.

2599
02:31:37,909 --> 02:31:39,909
Up here.

2600
02:31:39,909 --> 02:31:41,909
And then a normal hut.

2601
02:31:44,090 --> 02:31:46,090
You can spin it around too.

2602
02:31:48,090 --> 02:31:50,260
Um...

2603
02:31:52,260 --> 02:31:54,260
I like it right here.

2604
02:31:56,889 --> 02:31:59,899
Okay, that means I got some more room

2605
02:31:59,899 --> 02:32:02,329
here. Yeah, I don't want the

2606
02:32:02,329 --> 02:32:04,329
house right next to the barn, you know what I mean? It'll smell.

2607
02:32:04,329 --> 02:32:10,469
You can range friends

2608
02:32:10,469 --> 02:32:12,469
for Brumer. No problem at all,

2609
02:32:12,469 --> 02:32:14,469
buddy. If you outgrow this hut, give me a

2610
02:32:14,469 --> 02:32:17,030
haul at any time. The next time I

2611
02:32:17,030 --> 02:32:19,030
charge the regular fucking raid dude.

2612
02:32:19,030 --> 02:32:23,639
See you later.

2613
02:32:23,639 --> 02:32:25,940
I don't know what I'm doing.

2614
02:32:25,940 --> 02:32:27,940
I'm being completely honest here. Alright, let's go.

2615
02:32:27,940 --> 02:32:30,250
So, let's go get some friends.

2616
02:32:30,250 --> 02:32:37,739
What's the next disk that's going in?

2617
02:32:37,739 --> 02:32:42,600
Well, hello, everything going well.

2618
02:32:42,600 --> 02:32:44,600
What will it be?

2619
02:32:44,600 --> 02:32:46,600
Which method would you use?

2620
02:32:46,600 --> 02:32:48,600
I'm going to use a saucer.

2621
02:32:48,600 --> 02:32:51,159
Generate a monster from a saucer.

2622
02:32:53,159 --> 02:32:56,020
Even more.

2623
02:32:56,020 --> 02:32:58,020
Even more community subs.

2624
02:32:58,020 --> 02:33:04,469
Alright, so I'm thinking

2625
02:33:04,469 --> 02:33:06,469
either Floydgan Brothers or Seventh Cross

2626
02:33:06,469 --> 02:33:08,469
Evolution. Cause Seventh Cross

2627
02:33:08,469 --> 02:33:11,290
Evolution was a game

2628
02:33:11,290 --> 02:33:13,290
about evolving monsters.

2629
02:33:13,290 --> 02:33:17,770
Wait, Floydgan? You want me to get Floydgan in there?

2630
02:33:17,770 --> 02:33:19,770
Alright, okay. Alright, alright.

2631
02:33:19,770 --> 02:33:22,200
I'll do it. Here it is.

2632
02:33:22,200 --> 02:33:27,180
Why is this hot?

2633
02:33:27,180 --> 02:33:29,180
This disk is hot. It wasn't even, I don't know why.

2634
02:33:29,180 --> 02:33:31,540
The window? Maybe, yeah. The sun is like

2635
02:33:31,540 --> 02:33:33,540
shining on it. It's going to like melt this thing.

2636
02:33:33,540 --> 02:33:36,299
Alright, here you go. I always have to

2637
02:33:36,299 --> 02:33:38,299
prove that it's actually happening, so.

2638
02:33:38,299 --> 02:33:41,049
Here. Let me look at my

2639
02:33:41,049 --> 02:33:45,139
hair too. People were talking about my hair.

2640
02:33:45,139 --> 02:33:47,139
Yeah, it is a little fucking weird, isn't it?

2641
02:33:47,139 --> 02:33:52,440
Here you go. Floydgan.

2642
02:33:52,440 --> 02:34:00,620
For the Dreamcast. Power Stone.

2643
02:34:00,620 --> 02:34:02,620
I'll do Power Stone. Just not right this second.

2644
02:34:02,620 --> 02:34:07,860
Your hair looks very nice.

2645
02:34:07,860 --> 02:34:12,219
Floydgan Brothers going in.

2646
02:34:12,219 --> 02:34:18,340
Give us something good.

2647
02:34:18,340 --> 02:34:26,149
Give us like a team, a duo.

2648
02:34:26,149 --> 02:34:28,149
What if you put in the other Monster Rancher disk?

2649
02:34:28,149 --> 02:34:30,149
They all kind of have something crazy come out, don't they?

2650
02:34:30,149 --> 02:34:35,209
We had more community subs

2651
02:34:35,209 --> 02:34:39,559
from Lunch Meat.

2652
02:34:39,559 --> 02:34:41,559
How many hundreds of community subs?

2653
02:34:41,559 --> 02:34:45,590
The ending credits are going to be crazy tonight.

2654
02:34:45,590 --> 02:34:52,440
Thank you guys. Alright, here comes Floydgan Brothers.

2655
02:34:52,440 --> 02:34:55,129
See what we get. I hope

2656
02:34:55,129 --> 02:35:10,870
it's a monster with two heads.

2657
02:35:10,870 --> 02:35:13,049
I hope it looks like me.

2658
02:35:13,049 --> 02:35:15,049
The count is three hundred and forty.

2659
02:35:15,049 --> 02:35:19,719
Three hundred and forty community subs.

2660
02:35:19,719 --> 02:35:25,540
Thanks for waiting. Time to create

2661
02:35:25,540 --> 02:35:29,450
a monster. Alright, does it get

2662
02:35:29,450 --> 02:35:31,450
put in the trash or does it come to the ranch?

2663
02:35:47,959 --> 02:35:50,899
This is a Cheeto

2664
02:35:50,899 --> 02:35:59,290
flavored vroomer. I see

2665
02:35:59,290 --> 02:36:01,290
it's the first time Fane has raised this

2666
02:36:01,290 --> 02:36:03,290
monster. Let me add a page to your book.

2667
02:36:03,290 --> 02:36:06,360
Take this monster. Alright, am I

2668
02:36:06,360 --> 02:36:08,360
putting like the Cheeto

2669
02:36:08,360 --> 02:36:10,360
vroomer? Am I throwing the Cheeto vroomer away?

2670
02:36:10,360 --> 02:36:16,569
I'm not having two

2671
02:36:16,569 --> 02:36:26,940
vroomers.

2672
02:36:26,940 --> 02:36:28,940
Destroy. They're brothers.

2673
02:36:28,940 --> 02:36:32,200
It's the Floydgan Brothers.

2674
02:36:32,200 --> 02:36:34,200
Trash. Trash. Trash. Trash. Garbage.

2675
02:36:34,200 --> 02:36:36,200
Garbage. I need a pole. I'm seeing too much

2676
02:36:36,200 --> 02:36:41,899
of this. It's just

2677
02:36:41,899 --> 02:36:43,899
vroomer without any skin.

2678
02:36:43,899 --> 02:36:46,069
I don't want

2679
02:36:46,069 --> 02:36:59,299
whatever. Alright.

2680
02:36:59,299 --> 02:37:01,799
Trash or no. Trash it.

2681
02:37:01,799 --> 02:37:10,819
Keep it. There you go.

2682
02:37:10,819 --> 02:37:18,739
New pole.

2683
02:37:18,739 --> 02:37:23,930
Wow, this is

2684
02:37:23,930 --> 02:37:25,930
80 percent.

2685
02:37:25,930 --> 02:37:28,680
Oh, nobody

2686
02:37:28,680 --> 02:37:30,680
wants this.

2687
02:37:30,680 --> 02:37:32,920
That's unbelievable. This might be the most skewed

2688
02:37:32,920 --> 02:37:34,920
pole I think I've ever done in here.

2689
02:37:34,920 --> 02:37:45,459
80 percent. I don't think I could

2690
02:37:45,459 --> 02:37:50,010
even let this go on. Yeah, that's

2691
02:37:50,010 --> 02:37:52,010
it. Take this monster home. No.

2692
02:37:52,010 --> 02:37:58,139
I'm sorry.

2693
02:37:58,139 --> 02:38:01,209
Try a different saucer stone.

2694
02:38:01,209 --> 02:38:03,209
Sorry Floydgan.

2695
02:38:03,209 --> 02:38:08,459
The one up next is, we're going to put in

2696
02:38:08,459 --> 02:38:12,040
Tony Hawk 2.

2697
02:38:12,040 --> 02:38:18,440
See what we get with Tony Hawk. So you see

2698
02:38:18,440 --> 02:38:20,440
let me show it off. Let me show off

2699
02:38:20,440 --> 02:38:23,450
the disc. Tony Hawk's

2700
02:38:23,450 --> 02:38:25,450
Pro Skater 2. There it is.

2701
02:38:25,450 --> 02:38:27,450
In all of its glory. Original Dreamcast

2702
02:38:27,450 --> 02:38:29,450
video game.

2703
02:38:29,450 --> 02:38:35,899
Third vroomer.

2704
02:38:35,899 --> 02:38:47,530
We'll see. Here we go. Somebody on

2705
02:38:47,530 --> 02:38:52,010
a skateboard.

2706
02:38:52,010 --> 02:38:55,829
Oh my goodness.

2707
02:38:55,829 --> 02:38:57,829
Did you buy CDs just for the game?

2708
02:38:57,829 --> 02:39:02,309
No, I have all original hardware.

2709
02:39:02,309 --> 02:39:04,309
One of my taglines as a streamer

2710
02:39:04,309 --> 02:39:06,309
is like, German95

2711
02:39:06,309 --> 02:39:08,309
what's that channel like?

2712
02:39:08,309 --> 02:39:12,600
He's an original hardware streamer.

2713
02:39:12,600 --> 02:39:14,600
It's a game for myself.

2714
02:39:14,600 --> 02:39:16,600
Real Dreamcast. Real PlayStation 1.

2715
02:39:16,600 --> 02:39:21,079
Real hardware.

2716
02:39:21,079 --> 02:39:23,770
I actually got Tony Hawk over here

2717
02:39:23,770 --> 02:39:25,770
to like skateboard in front of me.

2718
02:39:25,770 --> 02:39:39,659
Real hardware only. Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2

2719
02:39:39,659 --> 02:39:41,659
for the Dreamcast. Let's see what happens.

2720
02:39:41,659 --> 02:39:43,659
A lot of Dreamcast games, yeah. We just did a bunch of them.

2721
02:39:43,659 --> 02:39:49,989
Thanks for waiting. Time to create.

2722
02:39:49,989 --> 02:40:02,659
I have like the

2723
02:40:02,659 --> 02:40:04,659
Karilla's latest album here too.

2724
02:40:08,379 --> 02:40:14,500
Uh, what a cute

2725
02:40:14,500 --> 02:40:17,319
monster. I see it's the first

2726
02:40:17,319 --> 02:40:19,319
time Vayne has raised this monster.

2727
02:40:19,319 --> 02:40:22,840
Let me add a page to your book.

2728
02:40:22,840 --> 02:40:24,840
Uh, are we taking the little mushroom home?

2729
02:40:24,840 --> 02:40:32,649
It's

2730
02:40:32,649 --> 02:40:34,649
Vinesauce.

2731
02:40:42,819 --> 02:40:45,450
Alright, we'll keep it.

2732
02:40:45,450 --> 02:40:47,750
We'll keep it.

2733
02:40:47,750 --> 02:40:56,649
It looks like a magician. I'm gonna keep it.

2734
02:40:56,649 --> 02:40:58,950
You're naming this monster.

2735
02:40:58,950 --> 02:41:06,760
Name it Vinny.

2736
02:41:08,760 --> 02:41:14,180
I don't know

2737
02:41:14,180 --> 02:41:16,180
if I want to name it Vinny because eventually if I

2738
02:41:16,180 --> 02:41:18,180
freeze it and kill it, that's not

2739
02:41:18,180 --> 02:41:20,180
I don't know if I'm gonna like that.

2740
02:41:20,180 --> 02:41:29,079
Alright, what if we do

2741
02:41:29,079 --> 02:41:31,079
a, a, okay, how about

2742
02:41:33,639 --> 02:41:40,549
how about

2743
02:41:40,549 --> 02:41:42,549
hashtag V?

2744
02:41:42,549 --> 02:41:46,260
Shroom

2745
02:41:46,260 --> 02:41:50,229
hashtag V

2746
02:41:50,229 --> 02:41:52,229
is so bad.

2747
02:41:52,229 --> 02:41:54,860
Let's just go with Shroomer.

2748
02:41:54,860 --> 02:41:56,860
Because that's pretty good. Hashtag V is the worst

2749
02:41:56,860 --> 02:41:59,030
name I've ever made up.

2750
02:41:59,030 --> 02:42:12,459
Shroomer.

2751
02:42:12,459 --> 02:42:14,760
Look after it. Try a different saucer

2752
02:42:14,760 --> 02:42:16,940
stone. Uh, yeah.

2753
02:42:16,940 --> 02:42:18,940
So I have two more, right? Or one more.

2754
02:42:18,940 --> 02:42:24,170
Alright,

2755
02:42:24,170 --> 02:42:26,170
this next one cannot end in an oomer.

2756
02:42:26,170 --> 02:42:30,520
Alright, what am I gonna do here? Alright, here's what I'm gonna put in.

2757
02:42:30,520 --> 02:42:33,079
I'm gonna put in

2758
02:42:33,079 --> 02:42:38,069
I'm gonna put in this.

2759
02:42:38,069 --> 02:42:41,270
This game is called

2760
02:42:41,270 --> 02:42:45,180
for the PC

2761
02:42:45,180 --> 02:42:47,180
or I don't know, I couldn't get it. Yeah,

2762
02:42:47,180 --> 02:42:49,180
Windows 95. I couldn't get this to fucking work

2763
02:42:49,180 --> 02:42:52,120
no matter what I did. This is

2764
02:42:52,120 --> 02:42:54,739
Jurassic Park Scan

2765
02:42:54,739 --> 02:42:59,100
Command. It's got a, you know, T-Rex

2766
02:42:59,100 --> 02:43:01,399
on it and everything.

2767
02:43:01,399 --> 02:43:03,399
This, I was gonna do a whole stream on this.

2768
02:43:03,399 --> 02:43:05,700
You have like a barcode scanner

2769
02:43:05,700 --> 02:43:09,610
and you scan it, but

2770
02:43:09,610 --> 02:43:12,549
there's a, didn't, I couldn't,

2771
02:43:12,549 --> 02:43:14,979
you know, just didn't work.

2772
02:43:14,979 --> 02:43:18,870
Scan Command.

2773
02:43:18,870 --> 02:43:21,110
Let's see what we get for Scan Command

2774
02:43:21,110 --> 02:43:26,170
for Jurassic Park. Why is your hair doing that?

2775
02:43:26,170 --> 02:43:28,540
I don't know.

2776
02:43:28,540 --> 02:43:31,030
I have a naturally fucked up head. I'm serious.

2777
02:43:31,030 --> 02:43:33,030
If I shave my head and you like put your hand

2778
02:43:33,030 --> 02:43:35,030
over it, it's like a little bumpy and like rocky

2779
02:43:35,030 --> 02:43:51,989
and shit. Opening the tray.

2780
02:43:51,989 --> 02:43:56,979
Let's see what Jurassic Park Scan

2781
02:43:56,979 --> 02:44:00,059
Command has in store.

2782
02:44:00,059 --> 02:44:05,299
Oh no, that was, that's Tony Hawk.

2783
02:44:05,299 --> 02:44:07,610
I wish I'd put Tony Hawk back in.

2784
02:44:07,610 --> 02:44:17,319
Alright, bring it on.

2785
02:44:17,319 --> 02:44:21,610
Five more community subs from GermanLight

2786
02:44:21,610 --> 02:44:25,319
about Minecraft VR. Five more.

2787
02:44:25,319 --> 02:44:27,319
Five, five, five, five, five. Coming in

2788
02:44:27,319 --> 02:44:29,319
every, every five minutes

2789
02:44:29,319 --> 02:44:31,319
with five community subs or ten community subs.

2790
02:44:31,319 --> 02:44:35,100
So many. Thank you.

2791
02:44:35,100 --> 02:44:50,760
I hope it's a dinosaur. Alright,

2792
02:44:50,760 --> 02:44:53,190
no rumor.

2793
02:44:53,190 --> 02:44:57,340
Okay, I kind of like it.

2794
02:44:57,340 --> 02:45:05,209
It looks like,

2795
02:45:05,209 --> 02:45:08,540
it looks like something that you could eat

2796
02:45:08,540 --> 02:45:10,540
on the set of Willy Wonka.

2797
02:45:10,540 --> 02:45:14,549
I'm keeping it. No, I'm not.

2798
02:45:14,549 --> 02:45:18,260
Ugh.

2799
02:45:18,260 --> 02:45:22,620
I only have three slots.

2800
02:45:22,620 --> 02:45:26,069
Too many mushrooms.

2801
02:45:26,069 --> 02:45:28,760
Too many mushrooms.

2802
02:45:28,760 --> 02:45:31,579
Trash it.

2803
02:45:31,579 --> 02:45:35,159
Too many, I'm not, no too much. We got two

2804
02:45:35,159 --> 02:45:46,549
mushrooms in a wheel. No.

2805
02:45:46,549 --> 02:45:48,549
Alright, the next thing going in, let me ask you,

2806
02:45:48,549 --> 02:45:50,549
okay, I don't know why I have this.

2807
02:45:50,549 --> 02:45:54,329
I don't even know if I did this before.

2808
02:45:54,329 --> 02:45:56,329
Um, some people are going to know what

2809
02:45:56,329 --> 02:46:00,620
this is. This is from

2810
02:46:00,620 --> 02:46:02,620
MTV Liquid Television.

2811
02:46:02,620 --> 02:46:06,579
This is a DVD

2812
02:46:06,579 --> 02:46:09,399
set of the show

2813
02:46:09,399 --> 02:46:16,229
The Head. Does anybody remember

2814
02:46:16,229 --> 02:46:19,239
this show? It was the Liquid Television

2815
02:46:19,239 --> 02:46:27,180
MTV Audities.

2816
02:46:27,180 --> 02:46:31,270
I got all of them. I have the whole show.

2817
02:46:31,270 --> 02:46:33,829
I, I don't know like why I have this.

2818
02:46:33,829 --> 02:46:36,260
I think I bought this at like a

2819
02:46:36,260 --> 02:46:39,399
convention or something. And I was like,

2820
02:46:39,399 --> 02:46:41,399
oh, MTV, the Liquid Audities.

2821
02:46:41,399 --> 02:46:43,399
I haven't even opened this. I like took

2822
02:46:43,399 --> 02:46:45,399
the skin off of it for some reason.

2823
02:46:45,399 --> 02:46:49,299
Why, and I don't know why I brought this across

2824
02:46:49,299 --> 02:46:52,059
the country. I donated

2825
02:46:52,059 --> 02:46:54,059
a ton of my old games

2826
02:46:54,059 --> 02:46:56,059
and I gave a bunch of my old stuff away, but

2827
02:46:56,059 --> 02:46:58,870
The Head came with me

2828
02:46:58,870 --> 02:47:03,860
for some reason. I haven't even

2829
02:47:03,860 --> 02:47:06,549
watched it. For some reason I thought it was going to be

2830
02:47:06,549 --> 02:47:10,260
worth money. It was dumb.

2831
02:47:10,260 --> 02:47:18,579
I don't know. My parents didn't let me

2832
02:47:18,579 --> 02:47:26,329
watch MTV. MTV

2833
02:47:26,329 --> 02:47:31,450
was pretty fucked up back then.

2834
02:47:31,450 --> 02:47:33,450
The cartoons on MTV were

2835
02:47:33,450 --> 02:47:35,450
like Nickelodeon 4.0

2836
02:47:35,450 --> 02:47:39,159
with like the grossness. Puke, like

2837
02:47:39,159 --> 02:47:41,159
farts, throw up, acid.

2838
02:47:41,159 --> 02:47:43,159
You know what I mean? Like there was all kinds of weird shit

2839
02:47:43,159 --> 02:47:45,159
on MTV back like in the 90s.

2840
02:47:45,159 --> 02:47:51,500
Nickelodeon had like farts and

2841
02:47:51,500 --> 02:47:53,500
puke and throw up and stuff, but

2842
02:47:53,500 --> 02:47:55,670
not like that, like the

2843
02:47:55,670 --> 02:47:57,670
Beavis and Butthead era on MTV.

2844
02:47:57,670 --> 02:48:18,649
Alright. Wait, did I put the

2845
02:48:18,649 --> 02:48:21,079
I didn't put the same disc in, right?

2846
02:48:21,079 --> 02:48:23,079
Why? I swear

2847
02:48:23,079 --> 02:48:25,079
to God. No,

2848
02:48:25,079 --> 02:48:28,860
I put this in.

2849
02:48:28,860 --> 02:48:34,469
It's the same monster.

2850
02:48:34,469 --> 02:48:37,290
Did it glitch out and save it?

2851
02:48:37,290 --> 02:48:39,290
Alright, we're doing the Head disc 2.

2852
02:48:39,290 --> 02:48:41,290
How do these have the same seed?

2853
02:48:41,290 --> 02:48:45,260
Disc 2 of the Head is

2854
02:48:45,260 --> 02:48:51,020
I'm not accepting that.

2855
02:49:00,600 --> 02:49:02,600
Didn't bring his PS4, but brought

2856
02:49:02,600 --> 02:49:12,459
the Head. Alright, but a

2857
02:49:12,459 --> 02:49:14,459
PS4 is big and bulky and has to go

2858
02:49:14,459 --> 02:49:16,459
in a box and shit. The Head is just a

2859
02:49:16,459 --> 02:49:26,569
DVD case. Alright.

2860
02:49:26,569 --> 02:49:29,379
Insert the Monster Rancher 4 disc.

2861
02:49:29,379 --> 02:49:36,170
This is the Head disc 2.

2862
02:49:36,170 --> 02:49:38,170
What about your Bloodborne save?

2863
02:49:38,170 --> 02:49:52,760
It's okay. Alright, give me something

2864
02:49:52,760 --> 02:49:59,930
else that's not a shroom.

2865
02:49:59,930 --> 02:50:01,930
He threw away his PS4? Oh no, I gave it

2866
02:50:01,930 --> 02:50:03,930
away. I gave my PS4.

2867
02:50:03,930 --> 02:50:24,889
Alright.

2868
02:50:24,889 --> 02:50:29,559
That was the

2869
02:50:29,559 --> 02:50:31,559
Head disc 1 disc 2 and

2870
02:50:31,559 --> 02:50:34,309
what was the one before it?

2871
02:50:34,309 --> 02:50:38,520
Scan command?

2872
02:50:57,860 --> 02:51:05,860
No, I'm not going to name it another

2873
02:51:05,860 --> 02:51:16,680
Umer. I told you. I told you

2874
02:51:16,680 --> 02:51:18,680
that's the thing on like you could eat in Willy Wonka.

2875
02:51:18,680 --> 02:51:20,680
I'm not naming him Tumer.

2876
02:51:20,680 --> 02:51:23,430
Or Umer. Or like

2877
02:51:23,430 --> 02:51:27,000
Doomer.

2878
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:33,340
No, we have Boomer, Shroomer,

2879
02:51:33,340 --> 02:51:38,709
and Wonka. Let me see the

2880
02:51:38,709 --> 02:51:42,420
stats. How do I get a different

2881
02:51:42,420 --> 02:51:45,049
another go? Okay, there's Shroomer,

2882
02:51:45,049 --> 02:51:47,049
Vroomer, and

2883
02:51:47,049 --> 02:51:49,350
Wonka.

2884
02:51:49,350 --> 02:51:51,350
This company doesn't even exist anymore.

2885
02:51:51,350 --> 02:51:53,719
They liquidated it. Look at that.

2886
02:51:53,719 --> 02:51:55,719
That's pretty awesome actually. Alright.

2887
02:51:55,719 --> 02:51:57,719
Shroomer.

2888
02:51:57,719 --> 02:51:59,719
High defense. Look at that.

2889
02:51:59,719 --> 02:52:09,059
He's doing the Peepo dance.

2890
02:52:09,059 --> 02:52:13,030
Wonka sucks.

2891
02:52:13,030 --> 02:52:15,909
Not really. That's a lot. That's really high health.

2892
02:52:15,909 --> 02:52:18,090
And the base intelligence

2893
02:52:18,090 --> 02:52:20,780
is really good.

2894
02:52:20,780 --> 02:52:23,590
What does he do?

2895
02:52:23,590 --> 02:52:26,600
Alright, we've got

2896
02:52:26,600 --> 02:52:29,350
pecking.

2897
02:52:29,350 --> 02:52:32,489
Slap. Accuracy

2898
02:52:32,489 --> 02:52:34,489
rate is pretty

2899
02:52:34,489 --> 02:52:36,489
high. This is the one right here. Pollen. This is a

2900
02:52:36,489 --> 02:52:39,299
poison. So unfortunately,

2901
02:52:39,299 --> 02:52:41,299
this is a dot. It's the only move

2902
02:52:41,299 --> 02:52:43,299
that doesn't do damage.

2903
02:52:43,299 --> 02:52:46,250
And even so,

2904
02:52:46,250 --> 02:52:48,250
it doesn't do very much damage. It's

2905
02:52:48,250 --> 02:52:50,250
D for damage. This is A for accuracy.

2906
02:52:50,250 --> 02:52:52,250
Yeah, he's terrible.

2907
02:52:52,250 --> 02:52:57,620
Ice him. Shroomer is

2908
02:52:57,620 --> 02:53:06,139
alright. High defense.

2909
02:53:06,139 --> 02:53:08,629
High base defense. Let's see what you

2910
02:53:08,629 --> 02:53:10,629
get from moves. Let's see if he's, you know,

2911
02:53:10,629 --> 02:53:13,450
So it's all about intelligence.

2912
02:53:13,450 --> 02:53:15,450
And power a little bit.

2913
02:53:15,450 --> 02:53:17,450
Let's see. This is

2914
02:53:17,450 --> 02:53:19,450
Pokorin.

2915
02:53:19,450 --> 02:53:21,450
It's a short range move. And then

2916
02:53:21,450 --> 02:53:23,620
aim hit.

2917
02:53:23,620 --> 02:53:27,530
Accuracy is an A.

2918
02:53:27,530 --> 02:53:29,530
Life damage is an E.

2919
02:53:29,530 --> 02:53:31,770
D.

2920
02:53:34,120 --> 02:53:37,129
He's kind of terrible.

2921
02:53:37,129 --> 02:53:39,129
The accuracy is alright.

2922
02:53:39,129 --> 02:53:41,370
But look at that life to E for life

2923
02:53:41,370 --> 02:53:45,020
damage.

2924
02:53:45,020 --> 02:53:48,219
We'll work on Shroomer. I feel like Shroomer will be

2925
02:53:48,219 --> 02:53:51,030
okay later.

2926
02:53:51,030 --> 02:53:53,399
He has lightning element

2927
02:53:53,399 --> 02:53:55,399
statuses.

2928
02:53:55,399 --> 02:53:57,399
Soft body.

2929
02:53:57,399 --> 02:53:59,399
Softens damage from punch or

2930
02:53:59,399 --> 02:54:02,729
stab attacks.

2931
02:54:02,729 --> 02:54:04,729
And is spoiled rotten already.

2932
02:54:04,729 --> 02:54:07,100
Doesn't like to fight.

2933
02:54:07,100 --> 02:54:10,170
Is already spoiled.

2934
02:54:10,170 --> 02:54:13,750
Doesn't like to fight.

2935
02:54:13,750 --> 02:54:15,750
You are really on thin ice and I really mean

2936
02:54:15,750 --> 02:54:17,750
that literally because you're going to get fucking

2937
02:54:17,750 --> 02:54:24,600
frozen in about 10 seconds.

2938
02:54:24,600 --> 02:54:26,600
I hate this thing.

2939
02:54:32,659 --> 02:54:34,659
I think it might be, I think we're going to freeze.

2940
02:54:34,659 --> 02:54:36,659
Both.

2941
02:54:36,659 --> 02:54:42,360
Alright.

2942
02:54:42,360 --> 02:54:44,659
How do I, what does it do?

2943
02:54:44,659 --> 02:54:46,659
It's not a praise. No. How do I do it?

2944
02:54:46,659 --> 02:54:55,100
Association.

2945
02:54:55,100 --> 02:54:57,100
Fuse him. I'll fuse him. I'll fuse him. I'll fuse him.

2946
02:54:57,100 --> 02:54:59,100
I'll fuse him. I'll fuse him. I'll fuse him.

2947
02:55:05,049 --> 02:55:07,049
Wonka and Shroomer are going to get fused.

2948
02:55:07,049 --> 02:55:12,340
Don't you need a certain item?

2949
02:55:12,340 --> 02:55:14,899
Alright. Retire.

2950
02:55:14,899 --> 02:55:19,190
Or can I combine them right now?

2951
02:55:19,190 --> 02:55:21,190
They have to be frozen.

2952
02:55:21,190 --> 02:55:23,190
Look at Mao's power.

2953
02:55:23,190 --> 02:55:25,190
100 base power? Why did we throw that one in the trash?

2954
02:55:25,190 --> 02:55:30,180
Alright. Retire.

2955
02:55:30,180 --> 02:55:35,690
Shroomer.

2956
02:55:35,690 --> 02:55:39,340
Freeze Shroomer.

2957
02:55:39,340 --> 02:55:41,700
Sorry, but that's the end of you.

2958
02:55:46,229 --> 02:55:49,819
Retire.

2959
02:55:49,819 --> 02:55:53,909
Wonka.

2960
02:55:53,909 --> 02:55:55,909
This feels unfair because Rumer's stats are terrible

2961
02:55:55,909 --> 02:55:57,909
in comparison to all, whatever.

2962
02:55:57,909 --> 02:56:11,530
Now.

2963
02:56:11,530 --> 02:56:16,200
Combine. Let's combine.

2964
02:56:16,200 --> 02:56:18,200
We got Shroomer.

2965
02:56:18,200 --> 02:56:22,540
Combine.

2966
02:56:22,540 --> 02:56:24,540
Shroomer and...

2967
02:56:24,540 --> 02:56:26,540
What is...

2968
02:56:26,540 --> 02:56:28,969
Is that what they were

2969
02:56:28,969 --> 02:56:30,969
combined with in the first place?

2970
02:56:30,969 --> 02:56:32,969
Shroomer and Wonka.

2971
02:56:32,969 --> 02:56:35,270
Mao's and Shroomer.

2972
02:56:35,270 --> 02:56:38,469
We're going to get

2973
02:56:38,469 --> 02:56:40,469
a Shroomer dog.

2974
02:56:45,379 --> 02:56:47,379
Not even a day

2975
02:56:47,379 --> 02:56:49,379
old.

2976
02:56:49,379 --> 02:56:51,379
Not even one day

2977
02:56:51,379 --> 02:56:53,379
old. Both of them.

2978
02:56:53,379 --> 02:56:59,059
Shroomer and

2979
02:56:59,059 --> 02:57:03,479
Wonka.

2980
02:57:03,479 --> 02:57:07,700
Does it cost any money?

2981
02:57:07,700 --> 02:57:09,700
Petrin or Mushtan?

2982
02:57:09,700 --> 02:57:13,799
Unless you

2983
02:57:13,799 --> 02:57:19,110
actually select it now.

2984
02:57:19,110 --> 02:57:21,110
195...

2985
02:57:21,110 --> 02:57:30,819
145?

2986
02:57:30,819 --> 02:57:32,819
What the fuck?

2987
02:57:32,819 --> 02:57:38,379
What on

2988
02:57:38,379 --> 02:57:42,860
earth just happened?

2989
02:57:42,860 --> 02:57:44,860
An anonymous gifter

2990
02:57:44,860 --> 02:57:47,350
has just given a hundred community

2991
02:57:47,350 --> 02:57:49,719
subs. Anonymous gifter.

2992
02:57:49,719 --> 02:57:51,719
I don't know who you are,

2993
02:57:51,719 --> 02:57:53,899
but that's a lot.

2994
02:57:53,899 --> 02:58:00,149
That's a lot.

2995
02:58:00,149 --> 02:58:04,180
Whoever you are. Thank you

2996
02:58:04,180 --> 02:58:06,180
for the hundred subs.

2997
02:58:06,180 --> 02:58:19,540
Jesus. That's insane.

2998
02:58:19,540 --> 02:58:21,540
Thank you. Whoever you are.

2999
02:58:21,540 --> 02:58:23,540
Uh, I feel like both these

3000
02:58:23,540 --> 02:58:29,819
are terrible. Let me try...

3001
02:58:29,819 --> 02:58:32,889
That was so...

3002
02:58:32,889 --> 02:58:34,889
That was fucking crazy. Thank you.

3003
02:58:34,889 --> 02:58:37,059
What about Mao's and

3004
02:58:37,059 --> 02:58:40,260
Shroomer?

3005
02:58:40,260 --> 02:58:48,329
Kairotopia 5 community subs.

3006
02:58:48,329 --> 02:58:51,020
Oh my god.

3007
02:58:53,319 --> 02:58:57,159
That one sucks too.

3008
02:58:57,159 --> 02:58:59,159
Yeah, the subs are still rolling in.

3009
02:58:59,159 --> 02:59:03,059
My god.

3010
02:59:03,059 --> 02:59:05,430
What about Mao's and Wonka?

3011
02:59:10,420 --> 02:59:14,260
No, we're gonna get like

3012
02:59:14,260 --> 02:59:17,270
Mushtan.

3013
02:59:17,270 --> 02:59:19,270
195 health is kinda good though.

3014
02:59:22,860 --> 02:59:25,670
Magic Lore

3015
02:59:25,670 --> 02:59:27,979
and Pheromone.

3016
02:59:27,979 --> 02:59:29,979
Skills Pecking, Slap, and Pollen.

3017
02:59:29,979 --> 02:59:31,979
Nothing is the other one.

3018
02:59:34,469 --> 02:59:37,100
This character is terrible.

3019
02:59:37,100 --> 02:59:40,040
It's just another dumb shitty mushroom.

3020
02:59:40,040 --> 02:59:45,610
Let's go put some more CDs in.

3021
02:59:45,610 --> 02:59:51,110
Shroomer has good magic potential

3022
02:59:51,110 --> 02:59:57,899
to be combined here.

3023
02:59:59,899 --> 03:00:01,899
We, alright, the next few, we gotta

3024
03:00:01,899 --> 03:00:03,899
we gotta win some competitions here.

3025
03:00:03,899 --> 03:00:06,459
I'm gonna go with

3026
03:00:06,459 --> 03:00:08,459
we'll put in

3027
03:00:08,459 --> 03:00:10,459
I have humans here.

3028
03:00:10,459 --> 03:00:12,459
Oops. What is this? Something just fell out of this.

3029
03:00:12,459 --> 03:00:14,459
What CD is this? Whatever it is.

3030
03:00:14,459 --> 03:00:16,459
Alright, this is the thing that's going in next.

3031
03:00:16,459 --> 03:00:18,459
I don't even care.

3032
03:00:18,459 --> 03:00:20,459
The next thing going in is

3033
03:00:20,459 --> 03:00:22,459
MLB Show 17.

3034
03:00:22,459 --> 03:00:38,950
Okay. Boomers Sports.

3035
03:00:38,950 --> 03:00:40,950
Baseball is not a boomers sport.

3036
03:00:40,950 --> 03:00:44,329
Really?

3037
03:00:44,329 --> 03:00:46,329
Baseball is boomers sport?

3038
03:00:46,329 --> 03:00:50,739
Baseball has

3039
03:00:50,739 --> 03:00:53,430
been around for a

3040
03:00:53,430 --> 03:00:55,430
fucking hundred plus years.

3041
03:00:55,430 --> 03:00:59,590
They were playing baseball

3042
03:00:59,590 --> 03:01:01,590
back when K and Ben were throwing rocks at each other.

3043
03:01:01,590 --> 03:01:05,819
What do you mean exactly?

3044
03:01:05,819 --> 03:01:07,819
A baby boomer is

3045
03:01:07,819 --> 03:01:10,120
not from like

3046
03:01:10,120 --> 03:01:12,940
1880.

3047
03:01:12,940 --> 03:01:15,819
Do you guys think that they're still alive?

3048
03:01:15,819 --> 03:01:17,819
Yeah, fuck all those boomers

3049
03:01:17,819 --> 03:01:19,819
born in 1872.

3050
03:01:19,819 --> 03:01:27,940
Boomers are just old people.

3051
03:01:27,940 --> 03:01:33,319
A baby boomer didn't

3052
03:01:33,319 --> 03:01:42,469
invent baseball.

3053
03:01:42,469 --> 03:01:44,709
They did. No, they didn't.

3054
03:01:44,709 --> 03:01:47,139
What's after the boomers?

3055
03:01:47,139 --> 03:01:49,139
The pilgrims, I think, right?

3056
03:01:49,139 --> 03:01:51,139
I don't know.

3057
03:01:51,139 --> 03:01:53,139
What was, boomer was like the

3058
03:01:53,139 --> 03:01:55,139
30s and the 40s, right?

3059
03:01:55,139 --> 03:02:06,540
What was before boomer? Pilgrim?

3060
03:02:06,540 --> 03:02:14,920
Super boomers.

3061
03:02:14,920 --> 03:02:20,549
Nobody existed before

3062
03:02:20,549 --> 03:02:26,379
boomers. What the fuck

3063
03:02:26,379 --> 03:02:28,379
is this? Why do I keep getting this?

3064
03:02:28,379 --> 03:02:30,379
Something's wrong with my game.

3065
03:02:30,379 --> 03:02:36,579
Something's wrong with my game.

3066
03:02:36,579 --> 03:02:39,590
I don't know what's going on.

3067
03:02:39,590 --> 03:02:42,860
I have to, I'm going to turn the game off.

3068
03:02:42,860 --> 03:02:44,860
And turn it back on. Wait, I have to save it.

3069
03:02:44,860 --> 03:02:50,680
Don't do that yet. Alright.

3070
03:02:50,680 --> 03:02:52,680
Insert a CD or DVD.

3071
03:02:52,680 --> 03:02:55,110
If this is the same thing, then come on.

3072
03:02:55,110 --> 03:02:59,590
Something's fucked up here. Alright, here it is.

3073
03:02:59,590 --> 03:03:01,590
Here's, here's, here's Gorilla's Humans.

3074
03:03:01,590 --> 03:03:09,270
ESPRoot5 Community

3075
03:03:09,270 --> 03:03:11,270
Subs. Thank you ESPRoot

3076
03:03:11,270 --> 03:03:20,360
Subs. All over the place tonight.

3077
03:03:20,360 --> 03:03:23,620
Everywhere. If this is a shroom,

3078
03:03:23,620 --> 03:03:25,620
I'm going to reset the game. I'm going to save it and restart.

3079
03:03:25,620 --> 03:03:30,739
Maybe it's because these DVDs are too

3080
03:03:30,739 --> 03:03:32,739
new? Well, I mean, was Dreamcast

3081
03:03:32,739 --> 03:03:36,579
Dreamcast was

3082
03:03:36,579 --> 03:03:38,579
they were CDs, right? Not DVDs.

3083
03:03:38,579 --> 03:03:53,110
Dreamcast wasn't DVD ROM, was it?

3084
03:03:53,110 --> 03:03:55,860
Alright, let's see if we get the same thing.

3085
03:03:55,860 --> 03:03:57,860
If it is a shroom, then I'm going to save

3086
03:03:57,860 --> 03:03:59,860
a reset. And then we might

3087
03:03:59,860 --> 03:04:01,860
somebody said we have to play, I think. More than 60%

3088
03:04:01,860 --> 03:04:03,860
of the monsters are held behind A rank

3089
03:04:03,860 --> 03:04:05,860
as always. Well, that sucks.

3090
03:04:05,860 --> 03:04:08,229
I have to get to A rank. Just get

3091
03:04:08,229 --> 03:04:16,040
to A rank. That's all we have to do.

3092
03:04:16,040 --> 03:04:18,409
Okay. No shroom.

3093
03:04:18,409 --> 03:04:21,350
No mushroom. Something else.

3094
03:04:21,350 --> 03:04:36,899
Clam.

3095
03:04:36,899 --> 03:04:38,899
This thing is so cool. It's a walnut

3096
03:04:38,899 --> 03:04:42,809
fucking. Oh, it's a walnut.

3097
03:04:42,809 --> 03:04:44,809
It's like the inside of a walnut.

3098
03:04:44,809 --> 03:04:52,940
First time Fane has raised this

3099
03:04:52,940 --> 03:04:54,940
monster. Let me add page to your book.

3100
03:04:54,940 --> 03:05:00,059
Yes, I'm taking it.

3101
03:05:00,059 --> 03:05:02,059
WALL-E?

3102
03:05:11,340 --> 03:05:13,340
A bell? No, it's a walnut.

3103
03:05:15,510 --> 03:05:21,909
WALL-E. I like

3104
03:05:21,909 --> 03:05:25,180
WALL-E.

3105
03:05:25,180 --> 03:05:27,180
Nut, nut. Nut, nut

3106
03:05:27,180 --> 03:05:29,180
man. Why would nut man?

3107
03:05:29,180 --> 03:05:32,569
WALL-E.

3108
03:05:32,569 --> 03:05:37,620
It's not nut

3109
03:05:37,620 --> 03:05:39,989
man. It's

3110
03:05:39,989 --> 03:05:41,989
WALL-E.

3111
03:05:41,989 --> 03:05:43,989
Okay, look. You can call

3112
03:05:43,989 --> 03:05:45,989
them nut man if you want.

3113
03:05:45,989 --> 03:05:51,620
It's not. It's a

3114
03:05:51,620 --> 03:05:53,620
WALL-E. WALL-E.

3115
03:05:53,620 --> 03:05:56,250
WALL-E the walnut.

3116
03:05:56,250 --> 03:06:03,219
WALL-NUT

3117
03:06:03,219 --> 03:06:05,219
WALL-BURG.

3118
03:06:05,219 --> 03:06:12,520
Let's get another one. Alright, so our game is not broken.

3119
03:06:12,520 --> 03:06:14,520
We just got unlucky.

3120
03:06:14,520 --> 03:06:17,340
Let's go with one more.

3121
03:06:17,340 --> 03:06:29,100
Uh oh. Oh shit. This is just

3122
03:06:29,100 --> 03:06:34,409
this is the Monster Rancher 4 disc.

3123
03:06:34,409 --> 03:06:36,409
It didn't get, I pressed the button too early.

3124
03:06:36,409 --> 03:06:44,260
Uh, no.

3125
03:06:47,020 --> 03:06:49,319
Okay. Hey, at least they knew.

3126
03:06:49,319 --> 03:06:53,030
So what's going on now?

3127
03:06:53,030 --> 03:06:55,030
What do I got right here? I could put

3128
03:06:55,030 --> 03:06:57,030
Mr. Mosquito. PlayStation 2.

3129
03:06:57,030 --> 03:06:59,030
Urban Chaos. PlayStation. Let's do

3130
03:06:59,030 --> 03:07:08,569
Mr. Mosquito. Maybe we'll get a

3131
03:07:08,569 --> 03:07:11,899
Mosquito monster. Please stop playing

3132
03:07:11,899 --> 03:07:14,649
this game. What are you talking about?

3133
03:07:14,649 --> 03:07:17,079
This game is so much fun. It's so much

3134
03:07:17,079 --> 03:07:19,079
fun just to like just hang out and make fucking

3135
03:07:19,079 --> 03:07:25,930
monsters from discs. Alright, Mr.

3136
03:07:25,930 --> 03:07:31,110
Mosquito going in. Put in Monster

3137
03:07:31,110 --> 03:07:33,110
Rancher 3. I don't own it anymore. That's one of the things

3138
03:07:33,110 --> 03:07:36,059
I didn't bring because I hated

3139
03:07:36,059 --> 03:07:38,620
that game. I thought it was terrible.

3140
03:07:38,620 --> 03:07:41,049
This is a little different

3141
03:07:41,049 --> 03:07:43,049
but it's still, it's still

3142
03:07:43,049 --> 03:07:45,049
I'm getting enjoyment from it. I didn't like 3 at all.

3143
03:07:45,049 --> 03:07:48,440
3 was weird. 3 did this thing where you had to

3144
03:07:48,440 --> 03:07:51,260
like walk around and do

3145
03:07:51,260 --> 03:07:53,260
select like shiny things on the

3146
03:07:53,260 --> 03:07:55,260
ground to train. I didn't like

3147
03:07:55,260 --> 03:08:05,620
it. This reminds me more of 2

3148
03:08:05,620 --> 03:08:07,860
than 3.

3149
03:08:07,860 --> 03:08:09,860
Does of 2. What? Whatever.

3150
03:08:09,860 --> 03:08:15,940
So this is Mr.

3151
03:08:15,940 --> 03:08:25,030
Mosquito. I think a bug just came out of

3152
03:08:25,030 --> 03:08:28,469
that. No. Just, just packing

3153
03:08:28,469 --> 03:08:34,420
peanut. You didn't show us.

3154
03:08:34,420 --> 03:08:37,049
Oh fuck. Oh well. Could have been anything.

3155
03:08:37,049 --> 03:08:41,659
I could be lying to you right now. I could be just

3156
03:08:41,659 --> 03:08:44,219
making that whole thing up. Here, look

3157
03:08:44,219 --> 03:08:46,219
I'll show you the disc. I'll show you. Just so you know

3158
03:08:46,219 --> 03:08:49,540
this thing was expensive too guys.

3159
03:08:49,540 --> 03:08:55,690
This was no, I gotta be careful

3160
03:08:55,690 --> 03:08:57,690
with this one. This was expensive.

3161
03:08:57,690 --> 03:09:01,340
Mr. Mosquito

3162
03:09:01,340 --> 03:09:03,340
from Eidos Interactive.

3163
03:09:03,340 --> 03:09:15,159
This was fucking, it was like 40

3164
03:09:15,159 --> 03:09:20,409
bucks. Let's go!

3165
03:09:20,409 --> 03:09:31,420
Break it in half. Okay fine, sure dude.

3166
03:09:34,680 --> 03:09:39,159
Fuck! Alright, yeah

3167
03:09:39,159 --> 03:09:41,159
excuse me. I'll take the fucking

3168
03:09:41,159 --> 03:09:43,159
Bear Swordsman. Holy

3169
03:09:43,159 --> 03:09:46,549
shit. I'll take the Power Ranger.

3170
03:09:46,549 --> 03:09:54,549
Yep. Robo Bear

3171
03:09:54,549 --> 03:10:01,459
Swordsman.

3172
03:10:01,459 --> 03:10:09,459
That's BB

3173
03:10:13,180 --> 03:10:15,180
This thing's cool. I'm gonna forget about

3174
03:10:15,180 --> 03:10:17,610
the other 2 characters. I don't care. Robo

3175
03:10:17,610 --> 03:10:20,549
BBs.

3176
03:10:20,549 --> 03:10:22,549
Robo Boomer. No.

3177
03:10:22,549 --> 03:10:24,549
This is not gonna be Robo Boomer.

3178
03:10:24,549 --> 03:10:26,549
Uh, how about

3179
03:10:26,549 --> 03:10:29,879
Robo Boomer.

3180
03:10:31,879 --> 03:10:33,879
Ugh, this is tough.

3181
03:10:38,549 --> 03:10:40,549
Slash. No. Uh

3182
03:10:43,500 --> 03:10:46,700
Bean Bag Boomer.

3183
03:10:46,700 --> 03:10:52,200
Oh that's a, that's a really good one.

3184
03:10:52,200 --> 03:10:54,200
I'll use that one. That's a good one. Dick Fart.

3185
03:10:54,200 --> 03:10:56,739
Yeah, sure.

3186
03:10:56,739 --> 03:10:59,110
That's a really good one. I'll do it.

3187
03:11:06,969 --> 03:11:10,299
This is a Dark Souls character?

3188
03:11:10,299 --> 03:11:12,299
Oh, you're getting invaded by, what's his name?

3189
03:11:12,299 --> 03:11:14,299
It's a bunch of asterisks.

3190
03:11:14,299 --> 03:11:16,469
Who's this? Invaded by Dick Fart

3191
03:11:16,469 --> 03:11:18,469
222222222223.

3192
03:11:25,299 --> 03:11:27,610
What's a, okay, what's like a

3193
03:11:27,610 --> 03:11:29,610
thrust or

3194
03:11:29,610 --> 03:11:33,819
the Hibernator.

3195
03:11:33,819 --> 03:11:35,819
Hibernator.

3196
03:11:35,819 --> 03:11:37,819
That's a little bit of Robo theme in a bear.

3197
03:11:37,819 --> 03:11:39,819
Hibernator.

3198
03:11:39,819 --> 03:11:41,819
What, no it is a bear. Bear's Hibernator.

3199
03:11:41,819 --> 03:11:43,819
Why would I have to have bear in there?

3200
03:11:45,819 --> 03:11:47,819
Hibernator.

3201
03:11:47,819 --> 03:11:49,819
Hyperba, Hyperbator.

3202
03:12:00,459 --> 03:12:02,459
Master.

3203
03:12:02,459 --> 03:12:04,459
Master.

3204
03:12:07,020 --> 03:12:09,020
Hyper, Hyperbator.

3205
03:12:13,020 --> 03:12:15,020
I, okay.

3206
03:12:15,020 --> 03:12:20,329
Hyperbator.

3207
03:12:20,329 --> 03:12:22,329
Why would I do that? You guys, what's,

3208
03:12:22,329 --> 03:12:24,329
you guys usually are pretty good.

3209
03:12:30,899 --> 03:12:32,899
I can't fit that.

3210
03:12:35,459 --> 03:12:39,500
I can, I can only have like

3211
03:12:39,500 --> 03:12:42,440
seven letters, guys.

3212
03:12:47,819 --> 03:12:51,319
Uhhhhh.

3213
03:12:51,319 --> 03:12:54,200
I gotta get out of here.

3214
03:13:16,700 --> 03:13:19,000
Robare?

3215
03:13:19,000 --> 03:13:22,700
Robare?

3216
03:13:26,700 --> 03:13:39,739
Roberto?

3217
03:13:39,739 --> 03:13:47,020
Roberto.

3218
03:13:47,020 --> 03:13:49,510
This thing's awesome.

3219
03:13:49,510 --> 03:13:52,780
What would it be? Back to the ranch, let's see.

3220
03:13:52,780 --> 03:13:55,020
This is gonna probably have, probably have

3221
03:13:55,020 --> 03:13:57,020
such ridiculous

3222
03:13:57,020 --> 03:14:06,229
stats. So I've got

3223
03:14:06,229 --> 03:14:08,469
Wally, Vroomer, and

3224
03:14:08,469 --> 03:14:12,569
Roberto.

3225
03:14:12,569 --> 03:14:16,920
Uhhhhh.

3226
03:14:16,920 --> 03:14:18,920
Actually not terrible base stats.

3227
03:14:18,920 --> 03:14:21,479
High defense, decent

3228
03:14:21,479 --> 03:14:27,370
power. It's all about power.

3229
03:14:27,370 --> 03:14:29,739
Okay, what do you got? You got

3230
03:14:29,739 --> 03:14:31,739
kick and charge.

3231
03:14:31,739 --> 03:14:33,739
Where's slash? You have a

3232
03:14:33,739 --> 03:14:38,340
sword in your hand.

3233
03:14:38,340 --> 03:14:40,340
Um, hold on a second, but guys

3234
03:14:40,340 --> 03:14:42,340
this is life damage B.

3235
03:14:42,340 --> 03:14:45,670
That's a lot of damage.

3236
03:14:51,030 --> 03:14:53,030
What's that? What is it? 22 guts?

3237
03:14:53,030 --> 03:14:55,030
That's not very much at all. This thing

3238
03:14:55,030 --> 03:14:57,770
actually could be pretty good.

3239
03:14:57,770 --> 03:14:59,770
Alright, what about your stats? Your uh,

3240
03:14:59,770 --> 03:15:02,010
golden foot.

3241
03:15:02,010 --> 03:15:04,250
Increases the power of moves that

3242
03:15:04,250 --> 03:15:07,059
use the feet. But you

3243
03:15:07,059 --> 03:15:09,059
have a sword in your hand.

3244
03:15:09,059 --> 03:15:11,059
You've got a golden foot.

3245
03:15:11,059 --> 03:15:14,700
That doesn't make any sense.

3246
03:15:14,700 --> 03:15:17,190
Alright, Wally, what about you?

3247
03:15:17,190 --> 03:15:19,190
Holy shit, look at that defense.

3248
03:15:19,190 --> 03:15:21,620
That's the best. Pure walnut

3249
03:15:21,620 --> 03:15:23,620
defense. And pretty high intelligence

3250
03:15:23,620 --> 03:15:28,040
too. This is probably the best character.

3251
03:15:28,040 --> 03:15:30,040
Look at the base defense.

3252
03:15:30,040 --> 03:15:32,860
Alright, we got some moves here. We got

3253
03:15:32,860 --> 03:15:35,479
life damage C.

3254
03:15:35,479 --> 03:15:37,479
That's not terrible. Pretty bad accuracy

3255
03:15:37,479 --> 03:15:39,479
rate though. What about this one?

3256
03:15:39,479 --> 03:15:41,479
This is called Cracker.

3257
03:15:41,479 --> 03:15:44,870
Not bad.

3258
03:15:44,870 --> 03:15:47,559
It adds addle to whatever that means.

3259
03:15:47,559 --> 03:15:49,989
Not bad.

3260
03:15:51,989 --> 03:15:54,870
What about you? Hard shell.

3261
03:15:54,870 --> 03:15:56,870
Reduces damage but harder to dodge

3262
03:15:56,870 --> 03:15:59,239
attacks. Okay.

3263
03:15:59,239 --> 03:16:01,239
And what's that element?

3264
03:16:01,239 --> 03:16:03,989
I don't know what element is.

3265
03:16:03,989 --> 03:16:07,059
Is it a teal? I don't know.

3266
03:16:07,059 --> 03:16:12,889
It's a wolf with a katana and you

3267
03:16:12,889 --> 03:16:14,889
didn't name him Sekiro. As a bear.

3268
03:16:14,889 --> 03:16:20,579
Maybe it is a wolf.

3269
03:16:20,579 --> 03:16:23,379
So it is a wolf.

3270
03:16:23,379 --> 03:16:25,379
But it's okay.

3271
03:16:25,379 --> 03:16:27,379
Just pretend it's a bear. That's a bear.

3272
03:16:27,379 --> 03:16:32,629
Alright.

3273
03:16:32,629 --> 03:16:34,629
So how do I... This is going to be interesting.

3274
03:16:34,629 --> 03:16:36,629
Oh fuck.

3275
03:16:36,629 --> 03:16:38,629
So.

3276
03:16:38,629 --> 03:16:40,629
Everybody has their own schedule.

3277
03:16:40,629 --> 03:16:43,000
Oh dear.

3278
03:16:43,000 --> 03:16:45,000
This is going to be micromanagement

3279
03:16:45,000 --> 03:16:47,000
of the video game.

3280
03:16:47,000 --> 03:16:49,000
So.

3281
03:16:49,000 --> 03:16:51,000
Let's see. Let's do

3282
03:16:51,000 --> 03:16:56,629
more defense. What do you need?

3283
03:16:56,629 --> 03:17:01,860
You need

3284
03:17:01,860 --> 03:17:05,260
your highest stat

3285
03:17:05,260 --> 03:17:07,260
is defense and intelligence.

3286
03:17:07,260 --> 03:17:09,750
Your moves...

3287
03:17:09,750 --> 03:17:11,750
The best move that you have

3288
03:17:11,750 --> 03:17:15,000
is

3289
03:17:15,000 --> 03:17:17,000
a power move.

3290
03:17:17,000 --> 03:17:19,000
But you have higher intelligence so this will probably do

3291
03:17:19,000 --> 03:17:21,000
more damage. So I'm going to say

3292
03:17:21,000 --> 03:17:23,180
increase intelligence. Intelligence

3293
03:17:23,180 --> 03:17:25,180
and defense. Intelligence, defense and

3294
03:17:25,180 --> 03:17:27,180
life. We'll start with here.

3295
03:17:27,180 --> 03:17:43,799
Give you a good schedule

3296
03:17:43,799 --> 03:17:45,799
here.

3297
03:17:45,799 --> 03:17:50,969
Three in a row.

3298
03:17:50,969 --> 03:17:53,340
Okay.

3299
03:17:53,340 --> 03:17:55,340
That looks alright.

3300
03:17:55,340 --> 03:17:57,340
We need one more here.

3301
03:17:57,340 --> 03:17:59,340
One more in

3302
03:17:59,340 --> 03:18:02,020
life.

3303
03:18:02,020 --> 03:18:04,020
Got two days of rest.

3304
03:18:04,020 --> 03:18:06,020
What about

3305
03:18:06,020 --> 03:18:08,020
you? So you have...

3306
03:18:08,020 --> 03:18:10,020
What's his moves?

3307
03:18:10,020 --> 03:18:13,479
He's kind of all over the place.

3308
03:18:13,479 --> 03:18:16,790
Power? Does he have any

3309
03:18:16,790 --> 03:18:18,790
intelligence moves? No.

3310
03:18:18,790 --> 03:18:20,790
It's all about power. So power.

3311
03:18:20,790 --> 03:18:23,100
Power, accuracy and life.

3312
03:18:23,100 --> 03:18:26,229
I would say. Or speed.

3313
03:18:26,229 --> 03:18:30,069
I'm going to do power, life and speed.

3314
03:18:30,069 --> 03:18:32,069
Because that defense is already high enough for now.

3315
03:18:32,069 --> 03:18:34,069
Power, life, speed.

3316
03:18:39,079 --> 03:18:46,170
Is it okay to clear the schedules

3317
03:18:46,170 --> 03:18:48,170
to other monsters using this gadget?

3318
03:18:48,170 --> 03:18:50,170
Oh, shit.

3319
03:18:50,170 --> 03:18:52,340
Okay. They can't do it

3320
03:18:52,340 --> 03:18:54,340
at the same time.

3321
03:18:58,899 --> 03:19:01,850
Oh, fuck. Okay. So

3322
03:19:01,850 --> 03:19:03,850
it's trampoline.

3323
03:19:03,850 --> 03:19:09,209
What was it?

3324
03:19:09,209 --> 03:19:11,209
Power, life and speed.

3325
03:19:11,209 --> 03:19:13,209
You can do the high jump.

3326
03:19:13,209 --> 03:19:15,209
We'll do trampoline on this day.

3327
03:19:15,209 --> 03:19:18,020
Rest.

3328
03:19:18,020 --> 03:19:20,020
Let's give you some life.

3329
03:19:20,020 --> 03:19:23,100
And we'll do

3330
03:19:23,100 --> 03:19:25,100
power again.

3331
03:19:25,100 --> 03:19:27,100
Rest.

3332
03:19:27,100 --> 03:19:29,719
And...

3333
03:19:29,719 --> 03:19:31,719
trampoline again.

3334
03:19:31,719 --> 03:19:33,719
Oh, you motherfucker. Who is doing it to this day?

3335
03:19:33,719 --> 03:19:37,430
You are.

3336
03:19:37,430 --> 03:19:39,430
You're using the speed.

3337
03:19:39,430 --> 03:19:41,430
You're doing fine.

3338
03:19:41,430 --> 03:19:43,430
No. What day are you not doing this?

3339
03:19:43,430 --> 03:19:45,430
I'm going to switch

3340
03:19:45,430 --> 03:19:49,780
these dates here.

3341
03:19:49,780 --> 03:19:51,780
Trampoline.

3342
03:19:51,780 --> 03:19:53,780
Target.

3343
03:19:58,659 --> 03:20:00,659
Okay. Now, you can do

3344
03:20:03,670 --> 03:20:05,670
trampoline.

3345
03:20:07,850 --> 03:20:09,850
There we go. I think we're ready.

3346
03:20:09,850 --> 03:20:12,280
Go for it.

3347
03:20:14,280 --> 03:20:19,579
So we had

3348
03:20:19,579 --> 03:20:22,200
rumors resting.

3349
03:20:22,200 --> 03:20:24,200
Wall-E plus six.

3350
03:20:24,200 --> 03:20:26,200
Roberto plus

3351
03:20:26,200 --> 03:20:28,629
six. Let's go take a look at what

3352
03:20:28,629 --> 03:20:30,629
they're doing. So we're just making a carnival

3353
03:20:30,629 --> 03:20:32,629
of monsters.

3354
03:20:32,629 --> 03:20:36,969
Good training.

3355
03:20:36,969 --> 03:20:41,700
You're doing great.

3356
03:20:41,700 --> 03:20:43,700
I don't even remember what the training was for this.

3357
03:20:43,700 --> 03:20:52,069
Where's Roberto?

3358
03:20:52,069 --> 03:20:54,069
He just took his arm off.

3359
03:20:54,069 --> 03:21:01,030
I think they're dumb.

3360
03:21:01,030 --> 03:21:06,219
Oh, no. Yay!

3361
03:21:06,219 --> 03:21:08,219
I'm having so much fun.

3362
03:21:08,219 --> 03:21:12,620
It's gold. No, I can't do that.

3363
03:21:12,620 --> 03:21:14,620
You're too cute.

3364
03:21:14,620 --> 03:21:21,850
I think this is going to be our

3365
03:21:21,850 --> 03:21:23,850
very special boy.

3366
03:21:23,850 --> 03:21:25,850
The other two. Who cares?

3367
03:21:25,850 --> 03:21:28,920
Well, actually, everybody loves the beanie baby.

3368
03:21:28,920 --> 03:21:32,120
I think this guy sucks.

3369
03:21:32,120 --> 03:21:35,899
Yeah, I might as well just throw

3370
03:21:35,899 --> 03:21:37,899
you into the freezer right now.

3371
03:21:37,899 --> 03:21:40,329
But we'll just leave. We'll see what happens.

3372
03:21:40,329 --> 03:21:42,329
I can only do one command,

3373
03:21:42,329 --> 03:21:44,329
right? Can I do anything else today?

3374
03:21:44,329 --> 03:21:46,329
Holy shit.

3375
03:21:46,329 --> 03:21:48,889
If that's going to hurt me.

3376
03:21:48,889 --> 03:21:50,889
I can do one command per

3377
03:21:50,889 --> 03:21:54,469
You are so cool,

3378
03:21:54,469 --> 03:21:56,469
but so dumb at the same time.

3379
03:21:56,469 --> 03:21:58,469
How are you doing? Are you doing okay?

3380
03:21:58,469 --> 03:22:00,469
Here, have some data.

3381
03:22:00,469 --> 03:22:06,170
Reason?

3382
03:22:06,170 --> 03:22:08,170
No, we're going to take him into tournaments.

3383
03:22:08,170 --> 03:22:11,989
Give him a chance, you know?

3384
03:22:11,989 --> 03:22:13,989
Alright. Not hungry, not hungry,

3385
03:22:13,989 --> 03:22:18,790
not hungry. Weekend activities.

3386
03:22:28,059 --> 03:22:30,059
I get three actions per week now. That's actually pretty good.

3387
03:22:30,059 --> 03:22:33,190
Uh oh.

3388
03:22:33,190 --> 03:22:36,649
Fane, wake up. Something's happened.

3389
03:22:36,649 --> 03:22:38,649
Oh, morning reel. What is it?

3390
03:22:38,649 --> 03:22:41,719
Somebody die.

3391
03:22:41,719 --> 03:22:43,719
Change those pants.

3392
03:22:43,719 --> 03:22:47,110
I don't even know what that's implying.

3393
03:22:47,110 --> 03:22:50,309
Sorry, just a second. I'll put something on.

3394
03:22:50,309 --> 03:22:52,309
Did I go to the bathroom with my pants?

3395
03:22:52,309 --> 03:22:55,260
Was I wearing pants?

3396
03:22:55,260 --> 03:22:57,260
This one,

3397
03:22:57,260 --> 03:22:59,260
this one found this this morning.

3398
03:22:59,260 --> 03:23:02,010
Was this giant cave here before?

3399
03:23:02,010 --> 03:23:04,250
No, I've never seen it before.

3400
03:23:04,250 --> 03:23:09,750
And I feel some strange power.

3401
03:23:09,750 --> 03:23:11,750
It seems like it's beckoning us.

3402
03:23:11,750 --> 03:23:15,850
Beckoning us? How cool.

3403
03:23:15,850 --> 03:23:19,110
Let's take the monsters and investigate.

3404
03:23:19,110 --> 03:23:21,110
What a cave doing here.

3405
03:23:21,110 --> 03:23:24,120
I'll have to investigate.

3406
03:23:24,120 --> 03:23:26,620
Excuse me, but who are you?

3407
03:23:26,620 --> 03:23:28,620
Me?

3408
03:23:28,620 --> 03:23:30,620
I'm in charge of the investigation of these parts.

3409
03:23:30,620 --> 03:23:32,620
Call me Mr. K.

3410
03:23:32,620 --> 03:23:35,110
And how about you kids?

3411
03:23:35,110 --> 03:23:37,110
Are you in charge of an investigation of this cave too?

3412
03:23:37,110 --> 03:23:39,930
Yes, that's why we're here.

3413
03:23:39,930 --> 03:23:42,739
Well, that's just splendid.

3414
03:23:42,739 --> 03:23:45,239
But you know, I'm a bit worried for you.

3415
03:23:45,239 --> 03:23:47,239
Let's take the monsters inside.

3416
03:23:47,239 --> 03:23:49,799
I have an idea.

3417
03:23:49,799 --> 03:23:51,799
Let the adventurer Mr. K.

3418
03:23:51,799 --> 03:23:53,799
tell you the ins and outs of exploring.

3419
03:23:53,799 --> 03:23:56,489
Is it going to be a tutorial?

3420
03:23:56,489 --> 03:23:58,489
Fuck the voice.

3421
03:23:58,489 --> 03:24:00,489
Finish all your preparations by the weekend.

3422
03:24:00,489 --> 03:24:02,489
Then meet me in front of the cave this weekend.

3423
03:24:02,489 --> 03:24:04,659
Until then.

3424
03:24:04,659 --> 03:24:06,659
Tata, he's gone. What a strange old man.

3425
03:24:06,659 --> 03:24:09,479
He seems like a nice guy.

3426
03:24:09,479 --> 03:24:15,559
And it might be fun to go exploring this weekend.

3427
03:24:15,559 --> 03:24:17,559
So this weekend, go exploring.

3428
03:24:17,559 --> 03:24:21,780
Who do I want to bring? Can I bring everybody?

3429
03:24:21,780 --> 03:24:26,709
What's the schedule?

3430
03:24:26,709 --> 03:24:28,709
Speed. Whoa.

3431
03:24:28,709 --> 03:24:30,709
Holy shit.

3432
03:24:30,709 --> 03:24:32,950
That was a lot.

3433
03:24:32,950 --> 03:24:34,950
Vroomer plus 16 speed.

3434
03:24:34,950 --> 03:24:36,950
Wally, 6 defense, 8 power for Roberto.

3435
03:24:36,950 --> 03:24:38,950
That was a lot.

3436
03:24:38,950 --> 03:24:40,950
That was like a critical hit.

3437
03:24:40,950 --> 03:24:42,950
Wow.

3438
03:24:42,950 --> 03:24:53,180
Good job.

3439
03:24:53,180 --> 03:24:57,909
Okay, how are you doing?

3440
03:24:57,909 --> 03:24:59,909
Okay, okay. He's kind of hungry.

3441
03:25:01,909 --> 03:25:03,909
What do robots eat?

3442
03:25:03,909 --> 03:25:09,479
That was pretty bad.

3443
03:25:09,479 --> 03:25:11,479
Actually pretty cool. That was awesome.

3444
03:25:11,479 --> 03:25:13,479
Yeah.

3445
03:25:13,479 --> 03:25:15,479
You get to stick around. That was awesome.

3446
03:25:15,479 --> 03:25:17,479
What about you?

3447
03:25:17,479 --> 03:25:19,479
Are you hungry?

3448
03:25:19,479 --> 03:25:23,829
Not yet.

3449
03:25:23,829 --> 03:25:27,100
Continue your training.

3450
03:25:27,100 --> 03:25:33,620
Alright, let's see the weekend activity.

3451
03:25:33,620 --> 03:25:36,250
Well, the weekend is here and I assume you're fully prepared.

3452
03:25:36,250 --> 03:25:38,250
Well then, we're off.

3453
03:25:38,250 --> 03:25:40,250
Mr. K., the adventurer, will be your guide on this fabulous expedition.

3454
03:25:40,250 --> 03:25:44,139
So is this just

3455
03:25:44,139 --> 03:25:46,139
adventure?

3456
03:25:46,139 --> 03:25:48,379
I've been raised exploring.

3457
03:25:48,379 --> 03:25:51,559
A toggle cave.

3458
03:25:51,559 --> 03:25:53,559
A mysterious cave found behind the

3459
03:25:53,559 --> 03:25:55,559
ranch one day.

3460
03:25:55,559 --> 03:25:57,559
Select monsters to explore with.

3461
03:26:01,989 --> 03:26:05,190
Wally? Who should go?

3462
03:26:05,190 --> 03:26:07,190
Who's like...

3463
03:26:07,190 --> 03:26:09,190
Roberto is the least.

3464
03:26:12,139 --> 03:26:16,809
Or maybe Vroomer.

3465
03:26:16,809 --> 03:26:19,799
Yeah.

3466
03:26:19,799 --> 03:26:25,430
Or if it's dangerous.

3467
03:26:25,430 --> 03:26:27,430
High defense maybe?

3468
03:26:27,430 --> 03:26:29,610
Let's throw Wally in there.

3469
03:26:29,610 --> 03:26:33,450
We can take everybody.

3470
03:26:33,450 --> 03:26:35,450
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3471
03:26:35,450 --> 03:26:37,450
What the hell is this?

3472
03:26:39,450 --> 03:26:41,450
This is turning into an iPad game.

3473
03:26:41,450 --> 03:26:45,350
713 energy.

3474
03:26:47,659 --> 03:26:53,479
Okay, I guess.

3475
03:26:53,479 --> 03:26:55,479
Let's go.

3476
03:26:59,000 --> 03:27:01,000
Go exploring with these monsters.

3477
03:27:01,000 --> 03:27:03,000
Yeah.

3478
03:27:03,000 --> 03:27:14,840
First floor of the toggle caves.

3479
03:27:14,840 --> 03:27:18,620
Let's start with the basics.

3480
03:27:18,620 --> 03:27:20,620
Left analog stick move.

3481
03:27:20,620 --> 03:27:22,620
You can move the camera with the right analog stick.

3482
03:27:22,620 --> 03:27:24,620
First try going to the treasure chest ahead of you.

3483
03:27:24,620 --> 03:27:26,620
The hell?

3484
03:27:26,620 --> 03:27:39,209
When in front of the chest push X to open it.

3485
03:27:39,209 --> 03:27:41,209
This is a different game.

3486
03:27:41,209 --> 03:27:46,889
What is it?

3487
03:27:46,889 --> 03:27:48,889
Received yarn ball.

3488
03:27:48,889 --> 03:27:50,889
Well, this yarn ball is yours now.

3489
03:27:50,889 --> 03:27:53,059
Keep it safe.

3490
03:27:53,059 --> 03:27:55,059
Sometimes chests are hidden when you get near a suspicious location.

3491
03:27:55,059 --> 03:27:57,059
The cursor appears.

3492
03:27:57,059 --> 03:28:03,659
Suspicious location.

3493
03:28:03,659 --> 03:28:05,829
Should I explore around?

3494
03:28:05,829 --> 03:28:07,829
I'm running out of time.

3495
03:28:07,829 --> 03:28:09,829
The top left is, I think, their total health pool or something.

3496
03:28:18,540 --> 03:28:20,540
That's how much energy they have.

3497
03:28:20,540 --> 03:28:22,540
Go close to a suspicious spot and look for the cursor.

3498
03:28:22,540 --> 03:28:37,110
This is not a suspicious spot.

3499
03:28:37,110 --> 03:28:43,260
Alright.

3500
03:28:43,260 --> 03:28:45,260
There's a mouse hole over here.

3501
03:28:45,260 --> 03:28:49,540
That's it. Now push the X right there.

3502
03:28:49,540 --> 03:28:51,540
Except you don't have a monster to search it right now.

3503
03:28:51,540 --> 03:28:53,540
How?

3504
03:28:53,540 --> 03:28:56,299
Let's move on. We'll search for stray monsters.

3505
03:28:56,299 --> 03:29:01,860
What are we talking about?

3506
03:29:01,860 --> 03:29:05,379
Can I select a different monster?

3507
03:29:05,379 --> 03:29:07,379
You can't fit in there or something? I don't get it.

3508
03:29:07,379 --> 03:29:09,379
Command.

3509
03:29:09,379 --> 03:29:15,260
Sword.

3510
03:29:15,260 --> 03:29:17,690
This is too big.

3511
03:29:17,690 --> 03:29:20,180
What about the walnut?

3512
03:29:20,180 --> 03:29:27,799
Whatever. Apparently I can't do it again anyways.

3513
03:29:27,799 --> 03:29:29,799
We're stray monsters.

3514
03:29:29,799 --> 03:29:32,680
Well, I think I just ran into...

3515
03:29:32,680 --> 03:29:36,379
Random encounters?

3516
03:29:43,100 --> 03:29:45,459
Alright, it's one of the flowers.

3517
03:29:45,459 --> 03:29:53,530
Here's the question.

3518
03:29:53,530 --> 03:29:55,530
So I have to...

3519
03:29:55,530 --> 03:29:57,530
Is this like Marvel vs. Capcom?

3520
03:29:57,530 --> 03:30:05,979
Can I pull in other people?

3521
03:30:05,979 --> 03:30:09,879
It's kill or be killed.

3522
03:30:09,879 --> 03:30:11,879
Experience plus 13.

3523
03:30:11,879 --> 03:30:17,500
Level 1.

3524
03:30:17,500 --> 03:30:19,500
Interesting.

3525
03:30:19,500 --> 03:30:21,500
Win battles to raise experience points.

3526
03:30:21,500 --> 03:30:23,500
As you level up, new skills, traits, and items can be obtained.

3527
03:30:23,500 --> 03:30:28,100
This is how you get new moves.

3528
03:30:28,100 --> 03:30:37,540
If you lose a battle, your experience, skills, and items remain, but you will return to your range fatigued.

3529
03:30:37,540 --> 03:30:45,049
Using Quit Exploring on the circle button, set square, is the same.

3530
03:30:45,049 --> 03:30:51,930
When you quit exploring, your monster becomes exhausted, and its lifespan is shortened.

3531
03:30:51,930 --> 03:30:53,930
What? You mean it won't live as long?

3532
03:30:53,930 --> 03:30:55,930
Nope. It's a cruel world.

3533
03:30:55,930 --> 03:31:00,219
What an explanation.

3534
03:31:00,219 --> 03:31:02,219
See the gauge on the lower left of the screen?

3535
03:31:02,219 --> 03:31:04,219
That's the energy gauge, and it lowers over time.

3536
03:31:04,219 --> 03:31:09,290
It's essential to exploration.

3537
03:31:09,290 --> 03:31:11,290
It lowers each time you move.

3538
03:31:11,290 --> 03:31:13,290
And when it reaches zero, your monster's life lowers.

3539
03:31:13,290 --> 03:31:15,290
Watch it carefully.

3540
03:31:15,290 --> 03:31:17,590
Does energy ever rise?

3541
03:31:17,590 --> 03:31:19,590
No, it does not rise.

3542
03:31:19,590 --> 03:31:25,590
But while you have energy, the life of the monsters that took damage during battle will gradually recover.

3543
03:31:25,590 --> 03:31:29,590
So run too much, and our exploring will be cut short.

3544
03:31:29,590 --> 03:31:31,590
Every floor has a staircase to the next floor.

3545
03:31:31,590 --> 03:31:37,590
If you make it there, you can return to your range without taking heavy damage, or go to the next floor.

3546
03:31:37,590 --> 03:31:41,590
Important choice, I suggest not getting too greedy in this respect.

3547
03:31:41,590 --> 03:31:44,090
I guess that's all. The rest is up to you.

3548
03:31:44,090 --> 03:31:46,090
Well, do your best.

3549
03:31:46,090 --> 03:31:55,290
I kind of don't want to do this.

3550
03:31:55,290 --> 03:32:01,510
I'm going to drain their life essence forever.

3551
03:32:01,510 --> 03:32:05,739
Something bats?

3552
03:32:05,739 --> 03:32:10,729
What about chests?

3553
03:32:10,729 --> 03:32:22,299
Nothing? Nothing to investigate? Nothing to look at?

3554
03:32:22,299 --> 03:32:29,659
I still have plenty of energy.

3555
03:32:29,659 --> 03:32:38,739
This is cool.

3556
03:32:38,739 --> 03:32:46,420
Alright, so we get a Mogie E.

3557
03:32:46,420 --> 03:32:50,010
R2...

3558
03:32:50,010 --> 03:32:52,010
Just...

3559
03:32:52,010 --> 03:32:54,010
Okay, L1 brings out another monster.

3560
03:32:54,010 --> 03:32:57,909
Alright, let's see what we got.

3561
03:32:57,909 --> 03:32:59,909
Timidity.

3562
03:32:59,909 --> 03:33:05,540
Alright, I don't want you to lose health, because you're my favorite.

3563
03:33:05,540 --> 03:33:07,540
What about the other move? Let's see it.

3564
03:33:07,540 --> 03:33:12,600
Team Up!

3565
03:33:12,600 --> 03:33:15,989
What does that mean?

3566
03:33:15,989 --> 03:33:17,989
Dodge. Dodge again.

3567
03:33:17,989 --> 03:33:24,069
Nice.

3568
03:33:24,069 --> 03:33:26,069
I want to do the other move, but he can't.

3569
03:33:26,069 --> 03:33:28,069
Let's bring in Beartow.

3570
03:33:28,069 --> 03:33:31,340
He's a little timid.

3571
03:33:31,340 --> 03:33:34,090
Kicks do more damage, right?

3572
03:33:34,090 --> 03:33:43,739
There we go.

3573
03:33:43,739 --> 03:33:53,579
Nobody did damage.

3574
03:33:53,579 --> 03:33:56,069
Fucking decimated.

3575
03:33:56,069 --> 03:34:03,879
Cool.

3576
03:34:03,879 --> 03:34:06,760
654.

3577
03:34:06,760 --> 03:34:08,760
Two paths that we can go down here.

3578
03:34:08,760 --> 03:34:13,559
Let's check the one on the left.

3579
03:34:13,559 --> 03:34:15,559
Okay, I kind of want a smaller monster out here.

3580
03:34:15,559 --> 03:34:17,559
Because you take up almost the whole screen.

3581
03:34:17,559 --> 03:34:21,079
Chest.

3582
03:34:21,079 --> 03:34:29,079
Obtain Junk Toy.

3583
03:34:29,079 --> 03:34:37,559
How are you that big?

3584
03:34:37,559 --> 03:34:40,379
Okay, well I got a toy.

3585
03:34:40,379 --> 03:34:50,680
Where do you corpse?

3586
03:34:50,680 --> 03:34:59,000
Oops.

3587
03:34:59,000 --> 03:35:02,579
Oh dear.

3588
03:35:02,579 --> 03:35:05,079
Meeklon E.

3589
03:35:05,079 --> 03:35:08,149
That's a cool little monster.

3590
03:35:08,149 --> 03:35:11,989
It's like a giant beetle.

3591
03:35:11,989 --> 03:35:17,430
E for easy, yeah.

3592
03:35:17,430 --> 03:35:19,430
They do have different ranks.

3593
03:35:19,430 --> 03:35:24,620
Obtained Rose Perfume.

3594
03:35:24,620 --> 03:35:30,440
You skipped the dance.

3595
03:35:30,440 --> 03:35:33,579
You've seen the dance a million times.

3596
03:35:33,579 --> 03:35:36,069
You don't have to see it every single time.

3597
03:35:36,069 --> 03:35:38,069
Chest. Good.

3598
03:35:38,069 --> 03:35:44,709
I definitely like this more than the last one.

3599
03:35:44,709 --> 03:35:46,709
Because this same idea was in the last one.

3600
03:35:46,709 --> 03:35:48,709
Because this same idea was in

3601
03:35:48,709 --> 03:35:50,709
Monster Rancher 3.

3602
03:35:50,709 --> 03:35:52,950
But this feels more fun to do.

3603
03:35:52,950 --> 03:35:55,700
Than the other one.

3604
03:35:55,700 --> 03:36:01,979
Don't ever skip.

3605
03:36:01,979 --> 03:36:05,370
I still have 600 points.

3606
03:36:05,370 --> 03:36:07,930
Should I get out of here?

3607
03:36:07,930 --> 03:36:09,930
That was like a little tutorial. I don't want to drain them.

3608
03:36:09,930 --> 03:36:12,489
Stay here forward.

3609
03:36:12,489 --> 03:36:18,180
Or ranch.

3610
03:36:18,180 --> 03:36:23,180
Let's go. Second floor.

3611
03:36:23,180 --> 03:36:28,229
We have to see the other command here.

3612
03:36:28,229 --> 03:36:30,229
We have to see how the other run.

3613
03:36:30,229 --> 03:36:32,229
How do you run, Roberto?

3614
03:36:32,229 --> 03:36:37,219
You all have a really loud,

3615
03:36:37,219 --> 03:36:39,399
annoying sound.

3616
03:36:39,399 --> 03:36:42,920
But that's okay.

3617
03:36:42,920 --> 03:36:44,920
Can I touch this?

3618
03:36:44,920 --> 03:36:47,780
What is it?

3619
03:36:47,780 --> 03:36:49,780
Roberto can't help you to investigate.

3620
03:36:49,780 --> 03:36:52,280
I know who might.

3621
03:36:52,280 --> 03:36:56,500
Not Wally.

3622
03:36:56,500 --> 03:36:58,500
Can the rumor jump up there? Like bounce up there?

3623
03:36:58,500 --> 03:37:02,020
Rumor can't help you investigate.

3624
03:37:05,719 --> 03:37:10,459
Wally can't help you investigate.

3625
03:37:10,459 --> 03:37:15,319
Why? Why are you all so stupid?

3626
03:37:15,319 --> 03:37:17,930
Whatever.

3627
03:37:17,930 --> 03:37:23,049
Maybe they have to be able to fly?

3628
03:37:23,049 --> 03:37:42,569
To get up there?

3629
03:37:42,569 --> 03:37:46,979
Chest! Playing cards!

3630
03:37:46,979 --> 03:37:50,700
That's cool.

3631
03:37:50,700 --> 03:37:52,700
Nobody can fit in here.

3632
03:37:52,700 --> 03:37:54,700
Can you fit in there? Are you big enough?

3633
03:37:54,700 --> 03:38:01,350
Wally can't help you.

3634
03:38:01,350 --> 03:38:11,139
Yu-Gi-Oh! Battle cards.

3635
03:38:11,139 --> 03:38:13,139
Ant Coro E.

3636
03:38:16,659 --> 03:38:19,479
What are they?

3637
03:38:19,479 --> 03:38:21,479
I think these are Sesame Street characters.

3638
03:38:21,479 --> 03:38:23,479
I want to do this move.

3639
03:38:23,479 --> 03:38:28,790
That's a cool move.

3640
03:38:28,790 --> 03:38:32,059
It's like a party blaster.

3641
03:38:32,059 --> 03:38:36,729
Stop being so timid. Stop!

3642
03:38:36,729 --> 03:38:39,610
That's the thorns.

3643
03:38:39,610 --> 03:38:42,809
You be in time. Bring in the drift.

3644
03:38:42,809 --> 03:38:50,229
It's one of those little party poppers.

3645
03:38:50,229 --> 03:38:57,319
As you buy the gas station.

3646
03:38:57,319 --> 03:39:03,979
Rumor almost level 2.

3647
03:39:03,979 --> 03:39:07,180
Isabel side smash?

3648
03:39:07,180 --> 03:39:09,420
Is that what Isabel does?

3649
03:39:09,420 --> 03:39:16,200
This is a green chest.

3650
03:39:16,200 --> 03:39:21,129
Obtained a life tablet.

3651
03:39:21,129 --> 03:39:23,129
What's this? Something strange is inside.

3652
03:39:23,129 --> 03:39:25,500
A stone tablet. It seems very old.

3653
03:39:25,500 --> 03:39:27,500
The writing seems to explain something.

3654
03:39:27,500 --> 03:39:29,860
A blueprint.

3655
03:39:29,860 --> 03:39:32,040
You're right. That's really interesting.

3656
03:39:32,040 --> 03:39:34,040
But why do I have the feeling that I've seen this before?

3657
03:39:34,040 --> 03:39:38,569
Really?

3658
03:39:38,569 --> 03:39:40,809
I suppose it's nothing.

3659
03:39:40,809 --> 03:39:42,809
Anyway, we found something really neat.

3660
03:39:42,809 --> 03:39:44,809
This is enough exploring for now.

3661
03:39:44,809 --> 03:39:49,159
Alright.

3662
03:39:49,159 --> 03:39:51,159
So the life tablet, I'm gonna assume when you combine it

3663
03:39:51,159 --> 03:39:53,159
you can add it and add extra life.

3664
03:39:53,159 --> 03:39:57,260
Or you can just consume it and put...

3665
03:39:57,260 --> 03:40:09,100
He left before I did.

3666
03:40:09,100 --> 03:40:12,870
Rio is just baked.

3667
03:40:12,870 --> 03:40:15,049
Hello. I invited myself in.

3668
03:40:15,049 --> 03:40:17,219
Guess you're out and about.

3669
03:40:17,219 --> 03:40:19,590
Yeah, I guess you could say that.

3670
03:40:19,590 --> 03:40:21,590
What's that stone you have there? Let me have a look.

3671
03:40:21,590 --> 03:40:23,899
This I found in the cave.

3672
03:40:23,899 --> 03:40:26,389
Do you know anything about it?

3673
03:40:26,389 --> 03:40:28,389
This design, these joints, looks like a blueprint

3674
03:40:28,389 --> 03:40:31,399
for a training gadget.

3675
03:40:31,399 --> 03:40:33,399
Wait a minute. Does that mean that people from ages

3676
03:40:33,399 --> 03:40:35,399
past use training gadgets too?

3677
03:40:35,399 --> 03:40:37,829
If that's the case, then this is a real discovery.

3678
03:40:37,829 --> 03:40:40,459
What?

3679
03:40:40,459 --> 03:40:42,819
Could I ask you a favor, Fane?

3680
03:40:42,819 --> 03:40:44,819
Could I borrow this from you?

3681
03:40:44,819 --> 03:40:47,190
I want to try recreating the ancient

3682
03:40:47,190 --> 03:40:49,190
training gadget described in these blueprints.

3683
03:40:49,190 --> 03:40:51,500
Sure, go right ahead.

3684
03:40:51,500 --> 03:40:53,500
Oh, I'll go exploring again and look for more.

3685
03:40:53,500 --> 03:40:55,860
Oh, actually, I'll give you the training

3686
03:40:55,860 --> 03:40:58,620
gadget as soon as it's done.

3687
03:40:58,620 --> 03:41:00,620
A chance to recreate a training gadget with my

3688
03:41:00,620 --> 03:41:03,239
very own hands.

3689
03:41:03,239 --> 03:41:05,610
Oh, it's just amazing.

3690
03:41:05,610 --> 03:41:07,610
I've got to get started right away by then.

3691
03:41:07,610 --> 03:41:10,489
Public looks so happy.

3692
03:41:10,489 --> 03:41:13,110
We've got to go exploring again.

3693
03:41:13,110 --> 03:41:20,729
How's everybody doing? Okay, we've got

3694
03:41:20,729 --> 03:41:22,729
more training sessions.

3695
03:41:22,729 --> 03:41:25,610
You're a little tired, but well...

3696
03:41:25,610 --> 03:41:27,610
Anybody scheduled to sleep right now?

3697
03:41:29,610 --> 03:41:33,239
Week one. Exercise,

3698
03:41:33,239 --> 03:41:36,500
rest, and trampoline.

3699
03:41:36,500 --> 03:41:40,149
Okay. Let's get to it.

3700
03:41:40,149 --> 03:41:47,190
Rumor's been

3701
03:41:47,190 --> 03:41:49,190
on point with the training recently.

3702
03:41:49,190 --> 03:41:51,500
Roberto, I'm going to scald you.

3703
03:41:51,500 --> 03:41:56,229
I mean, you didn't even try.

3704
03:41:56,229 --> 03:42:01,670
You just, you didn't even try.

3705
03:42:01,670 --> 03:42:05,510
Sorry.

3706
03:42:05,510 --> 03:42:14,969
He could have killed you.

3707
03:42:14,969 --> 03:42:21,620
You did really good, though. He thought about it.

3708
03:42:21,620 --> 03:42:23,989
And you're asleep. Good.

3709
03:42:23,989 --> 03:42:26,549
Anybody hungry?

3710
03:42:26,549 --> 03:42:31,100
Not really. Everything's all right.

3711
03:42:31,100 --> 03:42:33,100
Are you hungry?

3712
03:42:33,100 --> 03:42:40,459
So you can go

3713
03:42:40,459 --> 03:42:42,459
on an adventure. I can do this whenever I want.

3714
03:42:42,459 --> 03:42:44,459
That's cool.

3715
03:42:44,459 --> 03:42:47,270
Do I have to find a new place?

3716
03:42:47,270 --> 03:42:49,270
Probably have to find a new place to do it, right?

3717
03:42:55,879 --> 03:43:00,229
I like the snow.

3718
03:43:00,229 --> 03:43:02,229
It's nice.

3719
03:43:02,229 --> 03:43:04,229
What do we got on schedule now?

3720
03:43:04,229 --> 03:43:07,370
We've got exercise,

3721
03:43:07,370 --> 03:43:09,370
power, balance,

3722
03:43:09,370 --> 03:43:11,370
and you are going to rest.

3723
03:43:11,370 --> 03:43:14,059
Yeah, you're frustrated.

3724
03:43:14,059 --> 03:43:20,459
Might as well just rest.

3725
03:43:20,459 --> 03:43:22,760
Holy shit.

3726
03:43:22,760 --> 03:43:24,760
It's time to do some tournaments here.

3727
03:43:24,760 --> 03:43:31,930
Look at these stats.

3728
03:43:31,930 --> 03:43:35,129
205, 142,

3729
03:43:35,129 --> 03:43:37,940
149.

3730
03:43:37,940 --> 03:43:39,940
I think it's time.

3731
03:43:39,940 --> 03:43:44,940
Let's get some tournaments going here.

3732
03:43:47,370 --> 03:43:49,739
Here, have a mango.

3733
03:43:49,739 --> 03:43:58,680
Did you like it?

3734
03:43:58,680 --> 03:44:00,680
I don't want to be weird here, but

3735
03:44:00,680 --> 03:44:02,680
what is on the stomach?

3736
03:44:02,680 --> 03:44:14,139
What is that?

3737
03:44:14,139 --> 03:44:18,420
It's an ear.

3738
03:44:18,420 --> 03:44:20,420
Not yet. Hold on. You're not hungry.

3739
03:44:20,420 --> 03:44:22,420
You are very hungry and very tired.

3740
03:44:24,420 --> 03:44:26,600
Eat a potato.

3741
03:44:26,600 --> 03:44:33,770
Happy? Good.

3742
03:44:33,770 --> 03:44:36,200
Now you, on the other hand,

3743
03:44:36,200 --> 03:44:42,600
you're doing all right. You're just resting.

3744
03:44:42,600 --> 03:44:44,600
God, I can't wait to see you

3745
03:44:44,600 --> 03:44:47,030
in some fan fiction

3746
03:44:47,030 --> 03:44:51,829
OC somewhere.

3747
03:44:51,829 --> 03:44:53,829
Sorry, I meant to say every fan fiction OC.

3748
03:44:53,829 --> 03:44:57,159
I have to correct myself here.

3749
03:44:57,159 --> 03:45:00,680
All right, I think we can go.

3750
03:45:00,680 --> 03:45:02,680
Let me open up the schedule to see.

3751
03:45:10,040 --> 03:45:12,040
All right. Next week, let's plan out

3752
03:45:12,040 --> 03:45:14,040
some competitions for the three of them.

3753
03:45:14,040 --> 03:45:16,540
Calendar.

3754
03:45:18,709 --> 03:45:20,709
So, Rumor is able to

3755
03:45:20,709 --> 03:45:22,709
join this one. This is just a

3756
03:45:22,709 --> 03:45:24,709
snow cup. 1500 bucks.

3757
03:45:24,709 --> 03:45:26,709
Let's sign you up for this one.

3758
03:45:26,709 --> 03:45:28,709
Get your tip-top shape for it.

3759
03:45:28,709 --> 03:45:31,270
And then down here.

3760
03:45:33,270 --> 03:45:36,340
Can they fight each other?

3761
03:45:40,420 --> 03:45:42,420
Only one? Okay, Wally will do this one.

3762
03:45:42,420 --> 03:45:44,420
That's next week.

3763
03:45:44,420 --> 03:45:46,420
And then

3764
03:45:46,420 --> 03:45:49,940
Roberto

3765
03:45:49,940 --> 03:45:53,530
kind of can't do much.

3766
03:45:53,530 --> 03:45:55,530
There's already one

3767
03:45:55,530 --> 03:45:57,530
going on here.

3768
03:46:00,219 --> 03:46:02,219
He'll do the first one on this week,

3769
03:46:02,219 --> 03:46:04,219
Roberto. Another competition.

3770
03:46:04,219 --> 03:46:06,219
Oh no, that's the same one.

3771
03:46:06,219 --> 03:46:08,219
This is January, so February

3772
03:46:08,219 --> 03:46:10,219
you'll do this one.

3773
03:46:10,219 --> 03:46:16,219
All right.

3774
03:46:16,219 --> 03:46:18,219
This bed is so comfy right now.

3775
03:46:18,219 --> 03:46:20,219
I'm glad you're having a good comfy

3776
03:46:20,219 --> 03:46:23,799
rest.

3777
03:46:23,799 --> 03:46:25,799
Speaking of rest.

3778
03:46:25,799 --> 03:46:27,799
Let me take a look at the schedule here.

3779
03:46:27,799 --> 03:46:30,299
Tomorrow, Wally has a tournament.

3780
03:46:30,299 --> 03:46:34,520
How are you doing, Wally? You're doing fine.

3781
03:46:34,520 --> 03:46:36,520
Wally can do

3782
03:46:36,520 --> 03:46:38,520
whatever he wants to do here. Meditation.

3783
03:46:38,520 --> 03:46:40,760
And then Vroomer has

3784
03:46:40,760 --> 03:46:43,579
Vroomer, you need to rest.

3785
03:46:43,579 --> 03:46:46,459
Because you're very tired.

3786
03:46:46,459 --> 03:46:49,590
And you can do the trampoline tomorrow.

3787
03:46:49,590 --> 03:46:52,920
So rest.

3788
03:46:52,920 --> 03:46:54,920
And then you, it doesn't really matter.

3789
03:46:54,920 --> 03:46:57,610
All right, let's do it.

3790
03:46:59,610 --> 03:47:03,639
Vroomer looks really, yeah, Vroomer's

3791
03:47:03,639 --> 03:47:12,149
going to rest today.

3792
03:47:12,149 --> 03:47:14,149
There we go.

3793
03:47:14,149 --> 03:47:17,100
He's doing okay.

3794
03:47:17,100 --> 03:47:19,659
Get ready for your tournament tomorrow.

3795
03:47:19,659 --> 03:47:21,659
And no, you have the tournament tomorrow.

3796
03:47:21,659 --> 03:47:24,219
You're good. How are you doing over here?

3797
03:47:24,219 --> 03:47:31,319
You're always hungry.

3798
03:47:33,319 --> 03:47:36,010
Beef?

3799
03:47:36,010 --> 03:47:38,010
All right, will you like me if you do robot

3800
03:47:38,010 --> 03:47:40,010
animals eat beef?

3801
03:47:40,010 --> 03:47:43,340
Yeah, he liked it. Good. He loved it.

3802
03:47:43,340 --> 03:47:46,979
Now he's happy. Now he's lively. Good.

3803
03:47:46,979 --> 03:47:50,500
So now it's time

3804
03:47:50,500 --> 03:47:54,920
to proceed.

3805
03:47:54,920 --> 03:47:56,920
And it's a competition

3806
03:47:56,920 --> 03:47:59,350
tomorrow.

3807
03:47:59,350 --> 03:48:01,350
Right, yeah, tomorrow it is Wally.

3808
03:48:01,350 --> 03:48:05,940
Here we go.

3809
03:48:07,940 --> 03:48:13,430
Wally is lively.

3810
03:48:13,430 --> 03:48:15,430
He needs maybe a little bit of food.

3811
03:48:15,430 --> 03:48:17,860
Do you think you need food?

3812
03:48:17,860 --> 03:48:19,860
Do you need food?

3813
03:48:19,860 --> 03:48:24,219
Schedule for today.

3814
03:48:24,219 --> 03:48:26,219
Meditation for Wally.

3815
03:48:26,219 --> 03:48:28,219
Rest.

3816
03:48:28,219 --> 03:48:31,100
Yeah, you can have two days off.

3817
03:48:31,100 --> 03:48:33,100
And exercise for you.

3818
03:48:33,100 --> 03:48:35,100
And then it's your tournament tonight.

3819
03:48:35,100 --> 03:48:37,100
We'll feed you after this.

3820
03:48:37,100 --> 03:48:41,559
Not bad.

3821
03:48:41,559 --> 03:48:45,340
Not bad.

3822
03:48:45,340 --> 03:48:51,739
Hungry. Let's give you some food.

3823
03:48:51,739 --> 03:48:53,739
I'm kind of running

3824
03:48:53,739 --> 03:48:55,739
out of food.

3825
03:48:55,739 --> 03:48:57,739
He's like my uncle with the food bag.

3826
03:48:57,739 --> 03:49:02,899
Should be good, right?

3827
03:49:02,899 --> 03:49:04,899
Yeah, focused. Not hungry.

3828
03:49:04,899 --> 03:49:06,899
Not that tired.

3829
03:49:06,899 --> 03:49:09,850
What about you?

3830
03:49:09,850 --> 03:49:13,940
You okay?

3831
03:49:13,940 --> 03:49:23,079
You're doing a good job.

3832
03:49:23,079 --> 03:49:25,079
Bacon diaper? What do you mean a bacon diaper?

3833
03:49:28,659 --> 03:49:30,659
Oh, you mean

3834
03:49:30,659 --> 03:49:32,659
that. Like a bacon wrapped

3835
03:49:32,659 --> 03:49:37,209
skull.

3836
03:49:37,209 --> 03:49:39,209
I had no idea what the hell you're talking about.

3837
03:49:39,209 --> 03:49:44,069
Alright, let's see if

3838
03:49:44,069 --> 03:49:57,450
Wally can win a tournament.

3839
03:49:57,450 --> 03:49:59,450
The Christmas Cup. Merry Christmas.

3840
03:49:59,450 --> 03:50:06,549
Let's begin.

3841
03:50:06,549 --> 03:50:09,370
Chara, still

3842
03:50:09,370 --> 03:50:11,370
stuck in the shitty chicken league.

3843
03:50:11,370 --> 03:50:15,209
And then youth K.

3844
03:50:15,209 --> 03:50:18,090
Youth K.

3845
03:50:18,090 --> 03:50:21,219
So this is

3846
03:50:21,219 --> 03:50:24,040
me. Insanely high defense.

3847
03:50:24,040 --> 03:50:26,040
Good intelligence.

3848
03:50:26,040 --> 03:50:28,040
Not bad speed.

3849
03:50:28,040 --> 03:50:36,809
Really fast.

3850
03:50:36,809 --> 03:50:39,180
But terrible at almost every

3851
03:50:39,180 --> 03:50:41,420
single thing that matters.

3852
03:50:41,420 --> 03:50:45,129
It'll be hard to hit.

3853
03:50:45,129 --> 03:50:53,899
Shouldn't be a problem. Let's go.

3854
03:50:53,899 --> 03:50:56,329
What's my title? Oh, this is an awful title.

3855
03:50:56,329 --> 03:50:58,329
Another placeholder title that I forgot to change.

3856
03:50:58,329 --> 03:51:00,760
Creating life.

3857
03:51:00,760 --> 03:51:09,579
Whatever. Alright, Wally.

3858
03:51:09,579 --> 03:51:12,069
Let's go. Bring it on.

3859
03:51:12,069 --> 03:51:14,069
Ooh.

3860
03:51:14,069 --> 03:51:16,569
Right off the bat. Aggressive.

3861
03:51:16,569 --> 03:51:19,829
Party cracker.

3862
03:51:19,829 --> 03:51:21,829
Double party cracker.

3863
03:51:21,829 --> 03:51:27,899
Nope. Alright.

3864
03:51:27,899 --> 03:51:33,399
Dodged it all. I get really, really

3865
03:51:33,399 --> 03:51:38,389
good defense though, even if I get hit.

3866
03:51:38,389 --> 03:51:41,459
Still timid. Still timid.

3867
03:51:41,459 --> 03:51:44,780
Come on.

3868
03:51:44,780 --> 03:51:47,530
Come on. He can't do a

3869
03:51:47,530 --> 03:51:49,530
move either. We both make such a weird position.

3870
03:51:49,530 --> 03:51:53,940
Oh my god.

3871
03:51:53,940 --> 03:51:56,700
Oh my god.

3872
03:51:56,700 --> 03:52:00,020
I have so many guts.

3873
03:52:00,020 --> 03:52:02,020
This is kind of bad right now, Wally.

3874
03:52:02,020 --> 03:52:05,159
What the fuck is going on here? Timid

3875
03:52:05,159 --> 03:52:07,159
like four times in a row?

3876
03:52:07,159 --> 03:52:09,159
I can't even do his basic attack.

3877
03:52:09,159 --> 03:52:12,100
He's blocking everything.

3878
03:52:12,100 --> 03:52:14,790
Hellvana? What is that?

3879
03:52:14,790 --> 03:52:18,760
12% hit chance.

3880
03:52:18,760 --> 03:52:28,680
32%.

3881
03:52:28,680 --> 03:52:30,680
Okay, that makes him even harder to hit.

3882
03:52:30,680 --> 03:52:32,680
Lucky, actually.

3883
03:52:32,680 --> 03:52:34,680
That was a bad display, Wally.

3884
03:52:34,680 --> 03:52:40,950
That's a great dance though.

3885
03:52:40,950 --> 03:52:47,139
Alright, Chara, Youth K.

3886
03:52:47,139 --> 03:52:49,139
Youth K is one of those dogs with the

3887
03:52:49,139 --> 03:52:52,090
one of those dogs with the hats on.

3888
03:52:52,090 --> 03:52:54,090
Alright, Youth K and Wally.

3889
03:52:54,090 --> 03:52:56,090
Let's see.

3890
03:52:56,090 --> 03:52:59,100
Oh my god.

3891
03:52:59,100 --> 03:53:03,379
What the

3892
03:53:03,379 --> 03:53:09,340
hell is this?

3893
03:53:09,340 --> 03:53:11,340
Did you forget to train other things?

3894
03:53:11,340 --> 03:53:13,340
482 intelligence.

3895
03:53:13,340 --> 03:53:16,090
No accuracy.

3896
03:53:16,090 --> 03:53:18,090
No speed. No defense.

3897
03:53:18,090 --> 03:53:20,090
No power. What does your money even move?

3898
03:53:20,090 --> 03:53:22,090
Scratch is the move to look out for.

3899
03:53:22,090 --> 03:53:27,719
Alright.

3900
03:53:27,719 --> 03:53:35,579
We're gonna give it a try.

3901
03:53:35,579 --> 03:53:43,510
RNG just needs one hit.

3902
03:53:43,510 --> 03:53:46,200
Alright. Let's go.

3903
03:53:46,200 --> 03:53:52,459
Let's do it again.

3904
03:53:52,459 --> 03:53:54,950
Oh god, is this it?

3905
03:53:54,950 --> 03:53:58,219
Let's headbang.

3906
03:53:58,219 --> 03:54:00,899
63% chance to hit this.

3907
03:54:00,899 --> 03:54:02,899
You're dead.

3908
03:54:02,899 --> 03:54:10,899
Back to the drawing board with these stats.

3909
03:54:10,899 --> 03:54:21,719
What a dumb character.

3910
03:54:21,719 --> 03:54:23,719
I guess that would work.

3911
03:54:23,719 --> 03:54:25,719
But your hit chance is probably at

3912
03:54:25,719 --> 03:54:28,020
8-9%.

3913
03:54:28,020 --> 03:54:30,329
Always.

3914
03:54:30,329 --> 03:54:33,909
Maybe even worse.

3915
03:54:33,909 --> 03:54:38,780
What's the point of having all that intelligence?

3916
03:54:38,780 --> 03:54:42,100
Can you enable Pog?

3917
03:54:42,100 --> 03:54:44,100
Pogchamp? It already is enabled.

3918
03:54:44,100 --> 03:54:53,899
It's a global emo.

3919
03:54:53,899 --> 03:54:56,520
Alright. First week of January.

3920
03:54:56,520 --> 03:54:58,520
I think it is. Vroomer has a competition

3921
03:54:58,520 --> 03:55:01,079
coming up here, right? Tonight?

3922
03:55:01,079 --> 03:55:03,079
Yes. Vroomer has a competition

3923
03:55:03,079 --> 03:55:05,700
today.

3924
03:55:05,700 --> 03:55:07,700
And you're not that tired.

3925
03:55:07,700 --> 03:55:09,700
So let's see what we got here. Trampoline

3926
03:55:09,700 --> 03:55:11,700
for Vroomer. Get that speed

3927
03:55:11,700 --> 03:55:15,290
increase.

3928
03:55:15,290 --> 03:55:17,290
Are you tired?

3929
03:55:17,290 --> 03:55:19,290
Are you resting today?

3930
03:55:19,290 --> 03:55:21,290
Yes, you should be.

3931
03:55:21,290 --> 03:55:23,290
You're also resting today.

3932
03:55:23,290 --> 03:55:25,290
No, that's...I'm sorry.

3933
03:55:25,290 --> 03:55:31,479
Get back in the training.

3934
03:55:33,479 --> 03:55:35,719
Enable Pog.

3935
03:55:35,719 --> 03:55:37,719
I don't even know what you're talking about.

3936
03:55:37,719 --> 03:55:39,719
Enable Pog?

3937
03:55:39,719 --> 03:55:47,459
Pog is a zoomed-in version

3938
03:55:47,459 --> 03:55:49,459
of Pogchamp.

3939
03:55:49,459 --> 03:55:54,260
Oh. Lively, how you doing?

3940
03:55:54,260 --> 03:55:56,260
Where...oh, you're on the trampoline.

3941
03:55:58,760 --> 03:56:00,760
Focus. Let's get some food in you.

3942
03:56:00,760 --> 03:56:02,760
Just a little potato. Just something easy

3943
03:56:02,760 --> 03:56:04,760
so you can crash

3944
03:56:04,760 --> 03:56:07,129
on the competition. First,

3945
03:56:07,129 --> 03:56:09,299
time in D rank for Vroomer.

3946
03:56:09,299 --> 03:56:19,030
D rank, $1,500.

3947
03:56:19,030 --> 03:56:21,030
Let's see who

3948
03:56:21,030 --> 03:56:26,729
the competition is now.

3949
03:56:26,729 --> 03:56:28,729
If you want a better Pogchamp, just use German Venus.

3950
03:56:28,729 --> 03:56:31,739
Yeah, I mean, come on.

3951
03:56:31,739 --> 03:56:38,579
Vroomer, Carl,

3952
03:56:38,579 --> 03:56:40,579
Farrell, and Bob.

3953
03:56:40,579 --> 03:56:44,420
This is against Carl.

3954
03:56:44,420 --> 03:56:48,260
High HP,

3955
03:56:48,260 --> 03:56:51,209
but not a threat anywhere

3956
03:56:51,209 --> 03:56:53,209
else besides an intelligence. What are your moves?

3957
03:56:53,209 --> 03:56:55,209
A lot of intelligence moves.

3958
03:56:55,209 --> 03:56:57,209
Shouldn't be a problem, though.

3959
03:56:57,209 --> 03:57:13,399
Just get the Woodlum down.

3960
03:57:13,399 --> 03:57:18,329
Farrell is just one of those plants.

3961
03:57:18,329 --> 03:57:20,329
No, not very much defense. Just go in there.

3962
03:57:20,329 --> 03:57:23,659
Polish.

3963
03:57:23,659 --> 03:57:27,559
Popped it.

3964
03:57:27,559 --> 03:57:30,700
Come down.

3965
03:57:30,700 --> 03:57:33,579
Really? I'm going to back it up a little bit.

3966
03:57:33,579 --> 03:57:35,579
No, no, no, no, don't. That's his intelligence move

3967
03:57:35,579 --> 03:57:38,840
back there. I don't want him to have

3968
03:57:38,840 --> 03:57:40,840
any...no, that's not good.

3969
03:57:40,840 --> 03:57:43,850
25% chance to hit.

3970
03:57:43,850 --> 03:57:45,850
I'm going to stay forward, though,

3971
03:57:45,850 --> 03:57:47,850
because all of his moves are terrible

3972
03:57:47,850 --> 03:57:49,850
besides the ones at range.

3973
03:57:49,850 --> 03:57:51,850
No, stay in.

3974
03:57:51,850 --> 03:57:55,420
Damn.

3975
03:57:55,420 --> 03:57:57,420
Carly, kill him here.

3976
03:57:57,420 --> 03:58:00,620
Oh, this is bad.

3977
03:58:02,620 --> 03:58:10,469
This is bad. I have to hit him with

3978
03:58:10,469 --> 03:58:12,469
something, otherwise he's going to die.

3979
03:58:12,469 --> 03:58:14,780
35% chance to hit.

3980
03:58:14,780 --> 03:58:16,780
He's got a 66% chance to hit. Back it up.

3981
03:58:19,719 --> 03:58:21,719
That Nirvana thing

3982
03:58:21,719 --> 03:58:23,719
is ridiculous.

3983
03:58:23,719 --> 03:58:28,440
No!

3984
03:58:28,440 --> 03:58:30,440
That was kind of a last-ditch effort there.

3985
03:58:30,440 --> 03:58:33,770
Thank God.

3986
03:58:33,770 --> 03:58:35,770
I'll stay in the middle.

3987
03:58:35,770 --> 03:58:37,770
Percentage-wise, where does that put me?

3988
03:58:37,770 --> 03:58:39,770
It's pretty close, actually.

3989
03:58:39,770 --> 03:58:41,770
Uh-oh. Blocked it.

3990
03:58:41,770 --> 03:58:44,010
Block it!

3991
03:58:44,010 --> 03:58:46,010
Yes!

3992
03:58:46,010 --> 03:58:48,010
Getting close.

3993
03:58:48,010 --> 03:58:51,020
Perfect. Again.

3994
03:58:51,020 --> 03:58:53,020
Quick, quick, quick.

3995
03:58:53,020 --> 03:58:55,829
Composed.

3996
03:58:55,829 --> 03:58:59,479
What does that mean, composed?

3997
03:58:59,479 --> 03:59:03,510
Thankfully, I blocked the two dots.

3998
03:59:03,510 --> 03:59:07,989
That would have been bad.

3999
03:59:07,989 --> 03:59:13,299
Faro and Bob.

4000
03:59:13,299 --> 03:59:15,299
Pretty close. Bob wins.

4001
03:59:15,299 --> 03:59:19,530
Alright, Bob.

4002
03:59:19,530 --> 03:59:23,940
Fairly balanced.

4003
03:59:23,940 --> 03:59:27,659
Head throw, head swing, boomerang,

4004
03:59:27,659 --> 03:59:29,659
fat belly, and nasty.

4005
03:59:29,659 --> 03:59:34,899
Fairly balanced character.

4006
03:59:34,899 --> 03:59:37,530
Decent power.

4007
03:59:37,530 --> 03:59:39,530
Decent life. You kind of just spread out

4008
03:59:39,530 --> 03:59:41,530
all over the place, don't you?

4009
03:59:41,530 --> 03:59:45,940
Oh, and he's also nasty.

4010
03:59:45,940 --> 03:59:56,440
It's another one of those weird ducks,

4011
03:59:56,440 --> 03:59:58,440
but this is not a pumpkin. This one is made out of stone.

4012
03:59:58,440 --> 04:00:03,819
Get in there right away.

4013
04:00:03,819 --> 04:00:05,819
He's got nothing close.

4014
04:00:05,819 --> 04:00:10,280
Back it up.

4015
04:00:10,280 --> 04:00:12,840
He has nothing far away here.

4016
04:00:12,840 --> 04:00:16,549
Oh, he just got destroyed.

4017
04:00:16,549 --> 04:00:18,860
Alright, now I'm gonna take it in close.

4018
04:00:20,860 --> 04:00:23,739
That was just...

4019
04:00:23,739 --> 04:00:27,579
Those two moves are really good.

4020
04:00:27,579 --> 04:00:30,010
Unfortunately, the one in the back doesn't have a high percentage,

4021
04:00:30,010 --> 04:00:32,010
but if it hits, it's good.

4022
04:00:32,010 --> 04:00:41,079
It's some easy money.

4023
04:00:41,079 --> 04:00:43,319
I gotta take him out

4024
04:00:43,319 --> 04:00:47,530
to learn new moves.

4025
04:00:47,530 --> 04:00:50,340
And six new fans.

4026
04:00:50,340 --> 04:00:56,420
When do you get to milk your monsters?

4027
04:01:06,709 --> 04:01:09,459
How did I read that one?

4028
04:01:09,459 --> 04:01:11,459
I don't know, because I looked over and it was there.

4029
04:01:11,459 --> 04:01:16,069
That's so fucking stupid.

4030
04:01:16,069 --> 04:01:19,399
Alright, trampoline.

4031
04:01:19,399 --> 04:01:22,280
Okay, let's do some more tournaments

4032
04:01:22,280 --> 04:01:24,280
scheduled out here.

4033
04:01:24,280 --> 04:01:26,969
Can't do this in official one.

4034
04:01:26,969 --> 04:01:30,100
The next one available for

4035
04:01:30,100 --> 04:01:32,100
Rumor is here.

4036
04:01:34,469 --> 04:01:36,469
And then...

4037
04:01:36,469 --> 04:01:38,469
Over here is Roberto.

4038
04:01:38,469 --> 04:01:40,469
And we'll do Wally on this one.

4039
04:01:40,469 --> 04:01:42,469
So this string here...

4040
04:01:42,469 --> 04:01:44,469
February is the

4041
04:01:44,469 --> 04:01:46,469
tournament week, or month.

4042
04:01:48,469 --> 04:01:50,469
We'll do some more

4043
04:01:50,469 --> 04:01:52,469
just resting and training

4044
04:01:52,469 --> 04:01:55,860
in January.

4045
04:01:55,860 --> 04:02:00,729
Alright, how tired is everybody?

4046
04:02:00,729 --> 04:02:02,729
Everyone's pretty good, actually.

4047
04:02:02,729 --> 04:02:05,479
Begin!

4048
04:02:05,479 --> 04:02:12,260
Ten accuracy.

4049
04:02:12,260 --> 04:02:15,139
I have to bring

4050
04:02:15,139 --> 04:02:17,639
at some point here.

4051
04:02:17,639 --> 04:02:19,639
I gotta bring him back to adventure.

4052
04:02:26,020 --> 04:02:28,020
D and E. What babies?

4053
04:02:28,020 --> 04:02:30,780
Not for long.

4054
04:02:30,780 --> 04:02:32,780
He's gonna hit me up at C after the next tournament if I win it.

4055
04:02:32,780 --> 04:02:36,680
Do my parents watch my stream?

4056
04:02:39,559 --> 04:02:45,129
Oh yeah, my mom and dad are both subbed.

4057
04:02:45,129 --> 04:02:47,129
I need to feed. You are always hungry.

4058
04:02:47,129 --> 04:02:53,530
No, not you.

4059
04:02:53,530 --> 04:02:55,530
You're always hungry. Here. No, you don't get that.

4060
04:02:55,530 --> 04:02:57,530
Yes, you do.

4061
04:02:57,530 --> 04:03:00,409
I think he's the only one that wants to eat it.

4062
04:03:00,409 --> 04:03:06,809
Rest up.

4063
04:03:06,809 --> 04:03:10,780
Everyone's kind of tired.

4064
04:03:10,780 --> 04:03:14,219
Good work.

4065
04:03:14,219 --> 04:03:16,219
What do we need to work on here?

4066
04:03:18,219 --> 04:03:20,219
155. He's across the board.

4067
04:03:20,219 --> 04:03:27,059
He's pretty good.

4068
04:03:27,059 --> 04:03:29,059
Accuracy is kind of lacking.

4069
04:03:29,059 --> 04:03:31,059
Accuracy and intelligence.

4070
04:03:31,059 --> 04:03:33,620
Or maybe accuracy and power.

4071
04:03:33,620 --> 04:03:35,620
Accuracy and life.

4072
04:03:46,940 --> 04:03:48,940
Accuracy

4073
04:03:48,940 --> 04:03:51,299
and life is what I want to do.

4074
04:03:53,299 --> 04:04:01,799
Rest here.

4075
04:04:01,799 --> 04:04:04,420
Life?

4076
04:04:04,420 --> 04:04:06,420
It's gonna be close to the tournament though.

4077
04:04:06,420 --> 04:04:08,729
Let's see what happens after that.

4078
04:04:08,729 --> 04:04:10,729
Now you, Rumer,

4079
04:04:10,729 --> 04:04:13,290
what can you do here?

4080
04:04:13,290 --> 04:04:15,290
Rest.

4081
04:04:15,290 --> 04:04:17,290
Yeah, rest and then trampoline.

4082
04:04:17,290 --> 04:04:19,979
Yeah, that's, yeah.

4083
04:04:19,979 --> 04:04:21,979
I'll take the power in trampoline.

4084
04:04:21,979 --> 04:04:26,069
That sounds good.

4085
04:04:26,069 --> 04:04:36,889
Proceed.

4086
04:04:36,889 --> 04:04:38,889
February week two is the first tournament.

4087
04:04:38,889 --> 04:04:41,639
Not that focused.

4088
04:04:41,639 --> 04:04:47,979
Can we throw Roberto into a meat grinder?

4089
04:04:47,979 --> 04:04:49,979
We have, hold on there.

4090
04:04:49,979 --> 04:04:53,049
Wait till he shows himself in battle.

4091
04:04:53,049 --> 04:04:55,049
And then we'll decide that.

4092
04:04:55,049 --> 04:05:04,459
Level nine intelligence for Wally.

4093
04:05:06,459 --> 04:05:08,459
Roberto, not so good.

4094
04:05:08,459 --> 04:05:14,979
Frustrated.

4095
04:05:14,979 --> 04:05:17,290
Hey, you can do better.

4096
04:05:17,290 --> 04:05:19,590
Just relax.

4097
04:05:19,590 --> 04:05:23,030
Roberto's not a waste of space.

4098
04:05:23,030 --> 04:05:25,030
He's just tired.

4099
04:05:25,030 --> 04:05:27,030
And he's gonna rest this week.

4100
04:05:27,030 --> 04:05:34,180
Food you need to eat.

4101
04:05:34,180 --> 04:05:36,180
Have a mango.

4102
04:05:36,180 --> 04:05:38,489
Would you throw a fork into your garbage disposal?

4103
04:05:38,489 --> 04:05:45,530
No.

4104
04:05:45,530 --> 04:05:47,530
I actually, I would not.

4105
04:05:47,530 --> 04:05:49,829
That's a good idea.

4106
04:05:49,829 --> 04:05:51,829
What about a carrot?

4107
04:05:51,829 --> 04:05:53,829
Yeah, have a carrot.

4108
04:05:53,829 --> 04:05:55,829
You're gonna like this.

4109
04:05:55,829 --> 04:05:57,829
You won a good tournament.

4110
04:05:57,829 --> 04:05:59,829
You deserve it.

4111
04:05:59,829 --> 04:06:04,309
I'm running out of food.

4112
04:06:04,309 --> 04:06:06,309
I have to buy food.

4113
04:06:06,309 --> 04:06:08,309
He's focused for his tournament.

4114
04:06:08,309 --> 04:06:21,180
Yeah.

4115
04:06:21,180 --> 04:06:23,180
Two more weeks.

4116
04:06:23,180 --> 04:06:25,180
The way we raise Vroomer from this point on

4117
04:06:25,180 --> 04:06:27,180
will determine the difference between victory and defeat.

4118
04:06:27,180 --> 04:06:34,840
What does that mean?

4119
04:06:34,840 --> 04:06:37,850
Does he look sadder than usual? He looks sad today.

4120
04:06:37,850 --> 04:06:40,409
I don't know why.

4121
04:06:40,409 --> 04:06:46,469
Anyone catching that?

4122
04:06:46,469 --> 04:06:48,469
He's gonna do the trampoline.

4123
04:06:48,469 --> 04:06:50,469
Trampoline and then rest.

4124
04:06:50,469 --> 04:06:52,899
And then you can do exercise.

4125
04:06:52,899 --> 04:06:54,899
The tournament is here.

4126
04:06:54,899 --> 04:06:56,899
Now trampoline.

4127
04:06:56,899 --> 04:06:58,899
Exercise.

4128
04:06:58,899 --> 04:07:00,899
Rest.

4129
04:07:00,899 --> 04:07:02,899
Yeah, that looks good.

4130
04:07:02,899 --> 04:07:04,899
You have the tournament here.

4131
04:07:04,899 --> 04:07:06,899
So we're gonna do, yep.

4132
04:07:06,899 --> 04:07:08,899
Now there you go.

4133
04:07:08,899 --> 04:07:10,899
Target.

4134
04:07:10,899 --> 04:07:12,899
Rest.

4135
04:07:12,899 --> 04:07:14,899
No, we need a resting now.

4136
04:07:14,899 --> 04:07:16,899
Rest.

4137
04:07:16,899 --> 04:07:18,899
And then power.

4138
04:07:18,899 --> 04:07:20,899
And we'll have to see because you're really tired.

4139
04:07:20,899 --> 04:07:22,899
So you can rest.

4140
04:07:22,899 --> 04:07:24,899
Go for it.

4141
04:07:24,899 --> 04:07:31,180
Alright, pretty successful day.

4142
04:07:31,180 --> 04:07:37,639
Freeze him before he dies so he can live forever.

4143
04:07:37,639 --> 04:07:39,639
Yeah, I'm gonna use his body for another DNA.

4144
04:07:39,639 --> 04:07:41,639
Good work.

4145
04:07:41,639 --> 04:07:44,389
I don't have any food for you, but I'll say good job.

4146
04:07:44,389 --> 04:07:46,389
Yeah, Wally's doing a really good job training.

4147
04:07:46,389 --> 04:07:48,389
A lot of like plus eight, plus nine.

4148
04:07:48,389 --> 04:07:52,149
Very lively.

4149
04:07:52,149 --> 04:07:54,149
Okay, so now.

4150
04:07:54,149 --> 04:07:56,459
Very good job.

4151
04:07:56,459 --> 04:08:03,739
You too.

4152
04:08:03,739 --> 04:08:05,739
And you are just doing okay.

4153
04:08:05,739 --> 04:08:07,739
But you're also just really good at training.

4154
04:08:07,739 --> 04:08:09,739
And you're also just really good at training.

4155
04:08:09,739 --> 04:08:18,739
And you're also just really good at training.

4156
04:08:18,739 --> 04:08:20,739
Okay.

4157
04:08:20,739 --> 04:08:23,370
But you're also just resting, so.

4158
04:08:23,370 --> 04:08:25,370
What about food?

4159
04:08:25,370 --> 04:08:27,370
I gotta give you something before the tournament.

4160
04:08:27,370 --> 04:08:31,590
You like squid?

4161
04:08:31,590 --> 04:08:37,350
Yeah, you do.

4162
04:08:37,350 --> 04:08:39,350
Glad the heavy dialogue is gone.

4163
04:08:39,350 --> 04:08:41,350
It makes the game much more enjoyable.

4164
04:08:41,350 --> 04:08:43,850
Yeah.

4165
04:08:43,850 --> 04:08:45,850
It kinda just had to get us here though.

4166
04:08:45,850 --> 04:08:48,600
That like first 45 minutes of just kind of

4167
04:08:48,600 --> 04:08:50,600
TV show talking.

4168
04:08:50,600 --> 04:08:52,600
And look at the sacred tree.

4169
04:08:52,600 --> 04:08:56,440
I don't even remember that thing's name.

4170
04:08:56,440 --> 04:08:58,440
Oh yeah, save the game.

4171
04:09:01,959 --> 04:09:10,139
Have to do it from like the other menu.

4172
04:09:10,139 --> 04:09:13,909
Alright.

4173
04:09:13,909 --> 04:09:16,600
February, week one.

4174
04:09:16,600 --> 04:09:18,600
Hello, how are things? Need anything today?

4175
04:09:18,600 --> 04:09:21,290
Go ahead, take a look around.

4176
04:09:21,290 --> 04:09:23,290
Alright.

4177
04:09:23,290 --> 04:09:26,940
What can I buy? Training.

4178
04:09:26,940 --> 04:09:28,940
Sandbag, better sandbag.

4179
04:09:28,940 --> 04:09:30,940
I got lots of money, so.

4180
04:09:30,940 --> 04:09:32,940
The life blade.

4181
04:09:32,940 --> 04:09:36,010
That's the thing.

4182
04:09:36,010 --> 04:09:46,889
One by one, let's get this.

4183
04:09:46,889 --> 04:09:48,889
Life blade.

4184
04:09:48,889 --> 04:09:50,889
Put it right here, perfect fit.

4185
04:09:55,299 --> 04:09:57,739
That's the thing he made, right?

4186
04:09:59,739 --> 04:10:02,040
Probably, sandbag is, yeah.

4187
04:10:02,040 --> 04:10:04,040
I'm gonna need this.

4188
04:10:08,309 --> 04:10:10,739
Sandbag is

4189
04:10:10,739 --> 04:10:12,739
perfect fit right here.

4190
04:10:12,739 --> 04:10:14,739
And I can do one more here.

4191
04:10:14,739 --> 04:10:16,739
Whatever it's gonna be.

4192
04:10:16,739 --> 04:10:23,399
This one is book, target,

4193
04:10:23,399 --> 04:10:25,399
trampoline, tub.

4194
04:10:25,399 --> 04:10:27,399
I feel like I want the tub.

4195
04:10:37,670 --> 04:10:40,229
Tub.

4196
04:10:42,600 --> 04:10:46,120
Anything else that's it?

4197
04:10:46,120 --> 04:10:49,450
So what is a praise?

4198
04:10:49,450 --> 04:10:51,450
I had a praise one, but you don't have

4199
04:10:51,450 --> 04:10:53,450
a stone tablet. Alright, okay.

4200
04:10:53,450 --> 04:10:55,450
Sell, buy, end.

4201
04:10:58,579 --> 04:11:00,579
What will you do? I will end.

4202
04:11:00,579 --> 04:11:08,010
Yes. So now today,

4203
04:11:08,010 --> 04:11:11,139
it is

4204
04:11:11,139 --> 04:11:13,139
Roberto's tournament.

4205
04:11:13,139 --> 04:11:15,139
He's gonna rest today, because he's already

4206
04:11:15,139 --> 04:11:17,139
still tired. Why are you still

4207
04:11:17,139 --> 04:11:20,149
tired? But here's the thing now,

4208
04:11:20,149 --> 04:11:22,149
so balance.

4209
04:11:22,149 --> 04:11:24,149
I can change this to

4210
04:11:24,149 --> 04:11:26,149
the life blade.

4211
04:11:30,950 --> 04:11:35,750
Exercise can

4212
04:11:35,750 --> 04:11:37,750
be changed

4213
04:11:37,750 --> 04:11:39,750
to the sandbag.

4214
04:11:39,750 --> 04:11:42,379
Exercise can be changed to sandbag.

4215
04:11:42,379 --> 04:11:44,379
I know, yeah, yeah.

4216
04:11:44,379 --> 04:11:46,379
You need it more than he does.

4217
04:11:50,379 --> 04:11:52,379
You know what?

4218
04:11:52,379 --> 04:11:54,379
Let's do like,

4219
04:11:54,379 --> 04:11:56,379
you do the life blade.

4220
04:11:58,379 --> 04:12:00,379
Let's see what happens.

4221
04:12:00,379 --> 04:12:04,600
Plus ten, nice.

4222
04:12:04,600 --> 04:12:09,020
I needed that actually pretty bad.

4223
04:12:09,020 --> 04:12:11,319
Roberto, plus seven.

4224
04:12:11,319 --> 04:12:13,319
This is shake weight.

4225
04:12:13,319 --> 04:12:17,290
This is shake weight.

4226
04:12:17,290 --> 04:12:23,750
Looks like he's stuck

4227
04:12:23,750 --> 04:12:25,750
in an animation or something. Like he's glitching through the wall.

4228
04:12:25,750 --> 04:12:30,170
And then there's the sandbag.

4229
04:12:30,170 --> 04:12:34,649
He's out of control.

4230
04:12:34,649 --> 04:12:40,649
Alright.

4231
04:12:40,649 --> 04:12:42,649
I need food.

4232
04:12:42,649 --> 04:12:44,649
I'm running out of food. Eat a banana.

4233
04:12:44,649 --> 04:12:48,229
I'm gonna have to go to town and buy some stuff.

4234
04:12:48,229 --> 04:12:56,299
You're fine.

4235
04:12:56,299 --> 04:12:59,620
Alright, that's it.

4236
04:12:59,620 --> 04:13:02,940
Which money do I have?

4237
04:13:10,149 --> 04:13:12,149
Hold on, let me just swallow this banana.

4238
04:13:12,149 --> 04:13:15,799
Shrine, association, item shop.

4239
04:13:15,799 --> 04:13:18,170
Oh, welcome.

4240
04:13:18,170 --> 04:13:20,540
Well, what will you do?

4241
04:13:20,540 --> 04:13:22,540
I will buy.

4242
04:13:22,540 --> 04:13:24,540
Which will you buy?

4243
04:13:24,540 --> 04:13:27,350
I will buy

4244
04:13:27,350 --> 04:13:29,350
mushroom. The common mushroom

4245
04:13:29,350 --> 04:13:31,350
is cheap but it's not very filling or tasty.

4246
04:13:31,350 --> 04:13:33,780
Cheap and filling

4247
04:13:33,780 --> 04:13:35,780
so it's a breeder standard.

4248
04:13:35,780 --> 04:13:39,299
Let's get a few of these.

4249
04:13:39,299 --> 04:13:41,299
This is the one you want to buy, right?

4250
04:13:41,299 --> 04:13:43,299
Can I increase the...

4251
04:13:43,299 --> 04:13:45,299
I will take five potatoes.

4252
04:13:45,299 --> 04:13:51,319
I will also

4253
04:13:51,319 --> 04:13:53,319
hit energy bar. Like a cookie, it

4254
04:13:53,319 --> 04:13:55,319
charges up your monster fast.

4255
04:13:55,319 --> 04:13:57,319
I feel like I want

4256
04:13:57,319 --> 04:13:59,319
like a couple of these.

4257
04:13:59,319 --> 04:14:01,690
Just in case.

4258
04:14:01,690 --> 04:14:03,690
And then maybe a couple of bananas.

4259
04:14:03,690 --> 04:14:06,250
Three bananas.

4260
04:14:06,250 --> 04:14:08,250
Yeah.

4261
04:14:08,250 --> 04:14:12,020
And then yarn ball

4262
04:14:12,020 --> 04:14:14,020
junk toy.

4263
04:14:14,020 --> 04:14:17,100
Pretty old. I found this, didn't I?

4264
04:14:17,100 --> 04:14:19,850
It's like great as a toy. How do I do this?

4265
04:14:19,850 --> 04:14:22,860
How do I use this?

4266
04:14:22,860 --> 04:14:24,860
It will be five hundred bucks

4267
04:14:24,860 --> 04:14:27,670
for beef.

4268
04:14:27,670 --> 04:14:29,670
That's too much. I'm going to have to eat potatoes.

4269
04:14:29,670 --> 04:14:31,670
I'll get like a couple of electric potatoes.

4270
04:14:31,670 --> 04:14:34,870
This four games, there's actually

4271
04:14:34,870 --> 04:14:36,870
five games.

4272
04:14:36,870 --> 04:14:38,870
There's one after this too. But apparently the one

4273
04:14:38,870 --> 04:14:40,870
after this is

4274
04:14:40,870 --> 04:14:43,690
awful.

4275
04:14:43,690 --> 04:14:45,690
Is what I've heard.

4276
04:14:45,690 --> 04:14:50,940
I've heard Evo is a

4277
04:14:50,940 --> 04:14:52,940
unbearable...wow.

4278
04:14:52,940 --> 04:14:55,239
That's fifteen hundred bucks.

4279
04:14:55,239 --> 04:14:59,459
That's wrong? I mean

4280
04:14:59,459 --> 04:15:01,459
everybody told me Evo was terrible.

4281
04:15:01,459 --> 04:15:04,600
I heard it was not good.

4282
04:15:04,600 --> 04:15:06,600
Doesn't it have like a forty five on Metacredit

4283
04:15:06,600 --> 04:15:09,290
or something? Wow.

4284
04:15:09,290 --> 04:15:11,290
Wow.

4285
04:15:11,290 --> 04:15:13,290
Battle cards? Should I just sell

4286
04:15:13,290 --> 04:15:18,340
this? The DS ones are good.

4287
04:15:18,340 --> 04:15:21,799
Maybe I'll try those eventually.

4288
04:15:21,799 --> 04:15:23,799
Can I use the perfume for any reason besides just to sell it?

4289
04:15:23,799 --> 04:15:25,799
I mean the cards, what am I going to

4290
04:15:25,799 --> 04:15:30,600
play? Cards together?

4291
04:15:30,600 --> 04:15:32,600
Just sell it.

4292
04:15:32,600 --> 04:15:39,239
The Game Boy ones are good.

4293
04:15:39,239 --> 04:15:42,819
Which one's the best?

4294
04:15:42,819 --> 04:15:44,819
I think Monster Rancher 2 is the best one.

4295
04:15:44,819 --> 04:15:50,010
But this one's not bad.

4296
04:15:50,010 --> 04:15:52,010
This one's actually growing on me here.

4297
04:15:52,010 --> 04:16:03,399
Most fans agree it's 2 or the second one for DS.

4298
04:16:03,399 --> 04:16:05,399
I could see it.

4299
04:16:05,399 --> 04:16:07,700
2 just was very straightforward but it was fun.

4300
04:16:07,700 --> 04:16:09,700
It was very basic but

4301
04:16:09,700 --> 04:16:11,700
that's why it was so good.

4302
04:16:11,700 --> 04:16:14,139
It seems like every other game they've tried to add

4303
04:16:14,139 --> 04:16:16,139
a bunch of weird shit that nobody really wanted.

4304
04:16:16,139 --> 04:16:18,139
They just want to breed monsters

4305
04:16:18,139 --> 04:16:20,139
and fight monsters.

4306
04:16:20,139 --> 04:16:22,889
But this one is

4307
04:16:22,889 --> 04:16:24,889
I don't hate this one.

4308
04:16:24,889 --> 04:16:26,889
This one's actually really fun.

4309
04:16:26,889 --> 04:16:33,420
I don't mind this one.

4310
04:16:33,420 --> 04:16:35,420
Are we talking about Sekiro?

4311
04:16:35,420 --> 04:16:37,420
Yeah I completed Sekiro

4312
04:16:37,420 --> 04:16:39,420
on the last stream.

4313
04:16:39,420 --> 04:16:42,549
If you didn't catch the last couple streams

4314
04:16:42,549 --> 04:16:44,549
it was Sekiro. Actually the last 5 streams

4315
04:16:44,549 --> 04:16:47,559
in a row were Sekiro.

4316
04:16:47,559 --> 04:16:49,559
So it's time for the tournament.

4317
04:16:49,559 --> 04:16:51,559
You're just doing okay. That's not good.

4318
04:16:51,559 --> 04:16:55,059
It was easy.

4319
04:16:55,059 --> 04:16:57,059
No it was not.

4320
04:16:57,059 --> 04:16:59,620
Not even the slightest.

4321
04:16:59,620 --> 04:17:02,059
You're going to rest right now anyway.

4322
04:17:02,059 --> 04:17:04,059
So that's fine.

4323
04:17:04,059 --> 04:17:06,059
And then we'll see what you can do in battle.

4324
04:17:06,059 --> 04:17:08,059
I'm looking forward to it.

4325
04:17:08,059 --> 04:17:10,059
So now you, Lifeblade and Sandbag.

4326
04:17:10,059 --> 04:17:13,819
And then it's time to bring

4327
04:17:13,819 --> 04:17:15,819
Roberto into a...

4328
04:17:15,819 --> 04:17:17,819
That's so cute. I can't wait to go look at that.

4329
04:17:17,819 --> 04:17:25,670
Look at this.

4330
04:17:25,670 --> 04:17:27,670
Is that in his mouth or in his hands?

4331
04:17:27,670 --> 04:17:33,110
He's jiggling the thing around.

4332
04:17:33,110 --> 04:17:35,110
Oh he's getting tired.

4333
04:17:35,110 --> 04:17:38,760
Too much work.

4334
04:17:38,760 --> 04:17:43,180
What should I do again? I'm trying.

4335
04:17:43,180 --> 04:17:48,469
You're fine.

4336
04:17:48,469 --> 04:17:51,159
Eat a potato. Feel better.

4337
04:18:00,920 --> 04:18:02,920
He's praying out of bonfire.

4338
04:18:02,920 --> 04:18:07,770
How you doing?

4339
04:18:07,770 --> 04:18:09,770
Mr. Cheese Wheel. Are you good?

4340
04:18:09,770 --> 04:18:11,770
Tired. Oh boy.

4341
04:18:11,770 --> 04:18:16,819
Did I overwork you?

4342
04:18:16,819 --> 04:18:19,129
You look like Cherry.

4343
04:18:19,129 --> 04:18:21,500
From Pee Wee's Playhouse.

4344
04:18:21,500 --> 04:18:30,620
Come on. You can do it.

4345
04:18:30,620 --> 04:18:37,590
You can do it.

4346
04:18:37,590 --> 04:18:39,590
See? That's all he needed.

4347
04:18:39,590 --> 04:18:44,069
Some encouragement.

4348
04:18:44,069 --> 04:18:46,069
So you're very lively and you're focused.

4349
04:18:46,069 --> 04:18:48,069
You on the other hand, you're using food.

4350
04:18:50,069 --> 04:19:03,129
You can just have a potato.

4351
04:19:03,129 --> 04:19:05,129
Let's see if I can steamroll this competition.

4352
04:19:08,389 --> 04:19:15,559
It makes it really hard

4353
04:19:15,559 --> 04:19:17,559
to juggle three monsters, four monsters at the same time.

4354
04:19:17,559 --> 04:19:26,969
Before it was you just had

4355
04:19:26,969 --> 04:19:28,969
one monster and you worked

4356
04:19:28,969 --> 04:19:31,340
the hell out of them.

4357
04:19:31,340 --> 04:19:41,510
Now you've got a whole family.

4358
04:19:41,510 --> 04:19:43,510
Remember Gaddy.

4359
04:19:43,510 --> 04:19:45,510
Has Gaddy improved at all?

4360
04:19:45,510 --> 04:19:47,750
Let's find out. Not at all.

4361
04:19:47,750 --> 04:19:53,620
Gaddy has not even

4362
04:19:53,620 --> 04:20:04,569
trained one step.

4363
04:20:04,569 --> 04:20:06,569
That's fine. You can go against my Smurf.

4364
04:20:06,569 --> 04:20:17,239
That's a lot of damage.

4365
04:20:17,239 --> 04:20:19,799
Followed up with a kick.

4366
04:20:19,799 --> 04:20:28,250
You may as well just have that be

4367
04:20:28,250 --> 04:20:30,250
somebody's dog now. You know what I mean?

4368
04:20:30,250 --> 04:20:33,319
Why are you fighting here?

4369
04:20:33,319 --> 04:20:35,319
That should be like a lap dog

4370
04:20:35,319 --> 04:20:37,319
just sitting on somebody's

4371
04:20:37,319 --> 04:20:39,319
stomach while they're lying down on the couch.

4372
04:20:39,319 --> 04:20:48,069
What is that dog doing here?

4373
04:20:48,069 --> 04:20:50,069
That should be somebody's just friend.

4374
04:20:50,069 --> 04:20:52,069
Why are they here?

4375
04:20:52,069 --> 04:20:54,069
You're fighting like a giant robot with a sword

4376
04:20:54,069 --> 04:21:01,180
in his hand. See?

4377
04:21:01,180 --> 04:21:09,159
Come on. Alias.

4378
04:21:09,159 --> 04:21:11,159
164 in accuracy. That's pretty good.

4379
04:21:11,159 --> 04:21:13,719
It's not going to be enough.

4380
04:21:13,719 --> 04:21:28,500
We come from a similar

4381
04:21:28,500 --> 04:21:32,659
breed.

4382
04:21:36,420 --> 04:21:38,729
Nice dodge.

4383
04:21:38,729 --> 04:21:48,440
Fine.

4384
04:21:48,440 --> 04:21:54,389
Do it again.

4385
04:21:54,389 --> 04:22:00,709
What's the defense on the bird dog?

4386
04:22:00,709 --> 04:22:02,709
That's good.

4387
04:22:02,709 --> 04:22:07,260
It can't be that good.

4388
04:22:07,260 --> 04:22:12,120
There we go. See what?

4389
04:22:12,120 --> 04:22:21,399
Demon doll.

4390
04:22:21,399 --> 04:22:25,559
Gaddy actually won a fight.

4391
04:22:25,559 --> 04:22:27,559
Shocking.

4392
04:22:27,559 --> 04:22:29,559
We fought Kylan before.

4393
04:22:29,559 --> 04:22:31,559
Just fast.

4394
04:22:31,559 --> 04:22:33,559
And has good accuracy.

4395
04:22:33,559 --> 04:22:42,059
Losing to Gaddy.

4396
04:22:42,059 --> 04:22:47,559
What an embarrassment.

4397
04:22:47,559 --> 04:22:50,700
Double charge. Do it again.

4398
04:22:50,700 --> 04:22:52,940
Or kick it.

4399
04:22:52,940 --> 04:22:56,329
That's it.

4400
04:22:56,329 --> 04:22:58,329
Final guts.

4401
04:22:58,329 --> 04:23:08,549
This doesn't feel right.

4402
04:23:08,549 --> 04:23:13,930
I think he's ready. Roberto.

4403
04:23:13,930 --> 04:23:24,149
That was BM.

4404
04:23:24,149 --> 04:23:26,149
800 bucks 7 fame.

4405
04:23:26,149 --> 04:23:35,430
You guys wanted to retire him.

4406
04:23:35,430 --> 04:23:39,590
I wonder how long they live in this one.

4407
04:23:39,590 --> 04:23:44,969
Actually, it's time to go pee.

4408
04:23:44,969 --> 04:23:47,340
It's probably going to be the final pee of the night.

4409
04:23:47,340 --> 04:23:49,700
I'll be right back.

4410
04:26:10,540 --> 04:26:36,500
Alright. So where are we now?

4411
04:26:36,500 --> 04:26:41,180
Vroomer has a tournament today.

4412
04:26:43,180 --> 04:26:45,180
Wally has tournament 2.

4413
04:26:45,180 --> 04:26:48,629
This is class D.

4414
04:26:48,629 --> 04:26:50,629
And then...

4415
04:26:50,629 --> 04:26:52,629
One more of these and we can move to C.

4416
04:26:52,629 --> 04:26:57,620
So I don't...

4417
04:26:57,620 --> 04:26:59,620
I want you to rest right now.

4418
04:26:59,620 --> 04:27:02,440
Rest.

4419
04:27:02,440 --> 04:27:05,260
And then when you...

4420
04:27:05,260 --> 04:27:10,569
Get in the tub.

4421
04:27:10,569 --> 04:27:12,940
And you...

4422
04:27:12,940 --> 04:27:14,940
What was he doing before?

4423
04:27:14,940 --> 04:27:17,239
Balance, right?

4424
04:27:17,239 --> 04:27:19,239
Lifeblade.

4425
04:27:19,239 --> 04:27:21,239
Use the new things we bought.

4426
04:27:21,239 --> 04:27:23,239
Bad.

4427
04:27:23,239 --> 04:27:25,930
Really bad.

4428
04:27:25,930 --> 04:27:32,780
6 only? Come on.

4429
04:27:32,780 --> 04:27:35,909
You're in the tub now.

4430
04:27:35,909 --> 04:27:37,909
I mean, it's absolutely adorable, but...

4431
04:27:37,909 --> 04:27:44,569
I'm going to get 6 points.

4432
04:27:44,569 --> 04:27:47,000
How is this improving defense?

4433
04:27:47,000 --> 04:27:53,459
I guess he's running out of the way.

4434
04:27:53,459 --> 04:27:56,340
We haven't seen him do this yet.

4435
04:27:56,340 --> 04:27:59,860
What a weird way to increase your defense.

4436
04:27:59,860 --> 04:28:05,819
What a weird way to increase your HP.

4437
04:28:05,819 --> 04:28:07,819
Alright. You... I'm sorry, but come on.

4438
04:28:07,819 --> 04:28:11,399
You can do better than that.

4439
04:28:11,399 --> 04:28:15,690
I know you can.

4440
04:28:15,690 --> 04:28:23,819
You too.

4441
04:28:23,819 --> 04:28:25,819
They can do better than that.

4442
04:28:25,819 --> 04:28:27,819
I know they can.

4443
04:28:27,819 --> 04:28:30,819
You're just resting.

4444
04:28:30,819 --> 04:28:32,819
So you have a tournament.

4445
04:28:32,819 --> 04:28:34,819
Let's give you the potato.

4446
04:28:34,819 --> 04:28:36,819
There's something with starch in it.

4447
04:28:36,819 --> 04:28:42,649
So you can get some carbs.

4448
04:28:42,649 --> 04:28:44,649
How do you increase your HP?

4449
04:28:44,649 --> 04:28:46,649
You don't.

4450
04:28:46,649 --> 04:28:48,649
It gradually reduces from the second that you're born.

4451
04:28:48,649 --> 04:28:51,530
It starts at 100.

4452
04:28:51,530 --> 04:29:02,090
I mean, you can slow the damage over time.

4453
04:29:02,090 --> 04:29:04,090
You know, if you eat carrots and shit.

4454
04:29:04,090 --> 04:29:07,100
But eventually it goes to zero.

4455
04:29:07,100 --> 04:29:25,079
How can I decrease my HP?

4456
04:29:25,079 --> 04:29:27,079
I'm not going to answer that question.

4457
04:29:27,079 --> 04:29:29,079
I'm not going to answer that question.

4458
04:29:29,079 --> 04:29:37,459
I'm not going to answer that question.

4459
04:29:37,459 --> 04:29:39,459
Okay, this is the next class D.

4460
04:29:39,459 --> 04:29:42,600
Okay, this is the next class D.

4461
04:29:42,600 --> 04:29:47,719
Carl, Mary, and Nat.

4462
04:29:47,719 --> 04:29:49,719
Carl, Mary, and Nat.

4463
04:29:49,719 --> 04:29:51,719
Carl, Mary, and Nat.

4464
04:29:51,719 --> 04:29:53,719
Rumer versus Nat.

4465
04:29:53,719 --> 04:29:57,750
None of the physical moves are dangerous.

4466
04:29:57,750 --> 04:29:59,750
None of the physical moves are dangerous.

4467
04:29:59,750 --> 04:30:01,750
Pretty slow, but has fairly decent IQ moves.

4468
04:30:01,750 --> 04:30:03,750
Pretty slow, but has fairly decent IQ moves.

4469
04:30:03,750 --> 04:30:05,750
Thunder and attack.

4470
04:30:05,750 --> 04:30:08,120
Look out for thunder.

4471
04:30:08,120 --> 04:30:12,729
Their traits are super weapon.

4472
04:30:12,729 --> 04:30:26,170
What the hell does that mean?

4473
04:30:26,170 --> 04:30:31,159
Why can't we get one of these weirdos?

4474
04:30:31,159 --> 04:30:34,729
Why can't we get one of these weirdos?

4475
04:30:34,729 --> 04:30:36,729
It's far away.

4476
04:30:36,729 --> 04:30:38,729
Get in close.

4477
04:30:38,729 --> 04:30:41,100
Any of the moves that they can do from far away.

4478
04:30:41,100 --> 04:30:45,129
Get in close. Any of the moves that they can do from far away.

4479
04:30:45,129 --> 04:30:47,129
Don't even let them do it.

4480
04:30:47,129 --> 04:30:49,879
It's two shot.

4481
04:30:49,879 --> 04:30:51,879
That was a lot of damage.

4482
04:30:51,879 --> 04:30:55,340
That was a lot of damage.

4483
04:30:55,340 --> 04:30:58,090
I might get this character to like C or B tonight.

4484
04:30:58,090 --> 04:31:00,090
I might get this character to like C or B tonight.

4485
04:31:00,090 --> 04:31:02,090
Remember how long it took us to get from D to C,

4486
04:31:02,090 --> 04:31:04,090
Remember how long it took us to get from D to C,

4487
04:31:04,090 --> 04:31:09,579
C to B in Monster Ration 2?

4488
04:31:09,579 --> 04:31:18,149
C to B in Monster Ration 2?

4489
04:31:18,149 --> 04:31:21,290
It was hard.

4490
04:31:21,290 --> 04:31:23,590
There's a chance.

4491
04:31:23,590 --> 04:31:26,090
Mary sucks.

4492
04:31:26,090 --> 04:31:28,840
C to B is...

4493
04:31:28,840 --> 04:31:44,329
Watch out for the magic.

4494
04:31:44,329 --> 04:31:48,229
It's a pretty cool toad though.

4495
04:31:48,229 --> 04:31:50,229
We had a toad before.

4496
04:31:58,600 --> 04:32:02,250
That hurts so much.

4497
04:32:02,250 --> 04:32:04,250
Let's do another two shot.

4498
04:32:04,250 --> 04:32:06,250
Goodbye.

4499
04:32:06,250 --> 04:32:09,190
Aww.

4500
04:32:09,190 --> 04:32:14,889
Toothpaste toad?

4501
04:32:14,889 --> 04:32:16,889
Don't talk shit. It's really easy to lose.

4502
04:32:16,889 --> 04:32:24,100
I only have 150 health.

4503
04:32:24,100 --> 04:32:28,139
Oh god.

4504
04:32:28,139 --> 04:32:30,139
I talked shit and it's going to come back and haunt me.

4505
04:32:30,139 --> 04:32:32,139
I have to do this move.

4506
04:32:32,139 --> 04:32:34,139
I have to get a long shot here and end it.

4507
04:32:34,139 --> 04:32:39,190
Oh, he's bullish.

4508
04:32:39,190 --> 04:32:45,909
Oh no, this is it.

4509
04:32:45,909 --> 04:32:49,370
Oh no.

4510
04:32:49,370 --> 04:32:51,670
I talked a lot of shit there.

4511
04:32:51,670 --> 04:32:53,670
It's okay, I can still win. Carl has to lose.

4512
04:32:53,670 --> 04:33:02,299
I have to beat Carl right now.

4513
04:33:02,299 --> 04:33:06,580
200 health.

4514
04:33:06,580 --> 04:33:10,220
Nothing else though.

4515
04:33:10,220 --> 04:33:12,220
Just high HP.

4516
04:33:12,220 --> 04:33:24,299
Damn it.

4517
04:33:24,299 --> 04:33:26,659
Well, I had to lose once.

4518
04:33:26,659 --> 04:33:28,840
Eventually.

4519
04:33:28,840 --> 04:33:32,939
Alright, Carl.

4520
04:33:32,939 --> 04:33:36,900
What's the percentage here?

4521
04:33:36,900 --> 04:33:42,220
52?

4522
04:33:42,220 --> 04:33:44,220
Alright, good, good.

4523
04:33:44,220 --> 04:33:46,220
Just beat him.

4524
04:33:46,220 --> 04:33:50,759
Go back a little.

4525
04:33:50,759 --> 04:33:52,759
50%.

4526
04:33:52,759 --> 04:33:59,099
Stay back.

4527
04:33:59,099 --> 04:34:01,099
44%.

4528
04:34:01,099 --> 04:34:05,450
Accuracy is the big deal here.

4529
04:34:05,450 --> 04:34:07,450
Look at this. This is bad.

4530
04:34:07,450 --> 04:34:09,939
We are working on that.

4531
04:34:09,939 --> 04:34:11,939
Oh fuck you with this final bullshit.

4532
04:34:11,939 --> 04:34:20,389
We found the thing we need to work on.

4533
04:34:20,389 --> 04:34:24,819
Because that's not good.

4534
04:34:24,819 --> 04:34:27,189
My defense is good.

4535
04:34:27,189 --> 04:34:34,740
I'm blocking a lot of hits.

4536
04:34:34,740 --> 04:34:37,049
Accuracy.

4537
04:34:37,049 --> 04:34:41,400
I'm not doing so well.

4538
04:34:41,400 --> 04:34:43,400
49%.

4539
04:34:43,400 --> 04:34:46,650
Okay, good.

4540
04:34:46,650 --> 04:34:51,000
Still a chance to lose.

4541
04:34:51,000 --> 04:34:53,000
Do I have the accuracy upgrade?

4542
04:34:53,000 --> 04:34:58,119
Alright, Carl.

4543
04:34:58,119 --> 04:35:03,240
The winner of this terrific battle is Rumer.

4544
04:35:03,240 --> 04:35:05,240
That's because I beat Carl.

4545
04:35:05,240 --> 04:35:07,930
Nice. Just barely.

4546
04:35:07,930 --> 04:35:17,400
1500 bucks and a squid.

4547
04:35:17,400 --> 04:35:22,009
We have to get you into accuracy training.

4548
04:35:22,009 --> 04:35:24,009
Right now.

4549
04:35:24,009 --> 04:35:34,569
Good work, but still.

4550
04:35:34,569 --> 04:35:37,189
You gotta win one more of those.

4551
04:35:37,189 --> 04:35:40,139
Let me see you here.

4552
04:35:40,139 --> 04:35:42,139
Accuracy is really at 159.

4553
04:35:42,139 --> 04:35:44,439
It's really not anything that bad.

4554
04:35:44,439 --> 04:35:47,380
Needs to be higher.

4555
04:35:47,380 --> 04:35:52,119
Being at less than 50% sucks.

4556
04:35:52,119 --> 04:35:55,580
I guess it also depends on their speed too.

4557
04:35:55,580 --> 04:35:59,159
His health is terrible.

4558
04:35:59,159 --> 04:36:01,159
Accuracy and health. His defense is terrible too.

4559
04:36:01,159 --> 04:36:08,580
I'll do accuracy and health.

4560
04:36:08,580 --> 04:36:11,529
For now.

4561
04:36:11,529 --> 04:36:14,599
Rumer.

4562
04:36:14,599 --> 04:36:16,599
I need to win one more.

4563
04:36:16,599 --> 04:36:19,290
We'll do this one.

4564
04:36:19,290 --> 04:36:21,849
Because that gives us

4565
04:36:21,849 --> 04:36:23,849
one, two, yeah.

4566
04:36:23,849 --> 04:36:25,849
Okay.

4567
04:36:25,849 --> 04:36:27,849
Let's go to schedule.

4568
04:36:27,849 --> 04:36:30,020
You don't actually have to rest.

4569
04:36:30,020 --> 04:36:32,020
Good.

4570
04:36:32,020 --> 04:36:34,020
Okay.

4571
04:36:34,020 --> 04:36:36,020
Accuracy.

4572
04:36:36,020 --> 04:36:38,020
The life stick.

4573
04:36:40,020 --> 04:36:44,569
Rest here.

4574
04:36:44,569 --> 04:36:46,569
And then maybe

4575
04:36:46,569 --> 04:36:49,000
the life stick again.

4576
04:36:51,000 --> 04:36:53,000
The rest of you know who has

4577
04:36:53,000 --> 04:36:55,000
somebody has something today, right?

4578
04:36:55,000 --> 04:36:57,560
You Wally does.

4579
04:36:57,560 --> 04:36:59,560
Wally is frustrated so

4580
04:36:59,560 --> 04:37:06,599
just rest Wally.

4581
04:37:06,599 --> 04:37:08,599
And then you don't have anything for a while

4582
04:37:08,599 --> 04:37:10,599
but you're still tired so you may as well rest.

4583
04:37:10,599 --> 04:37:17,830
Let's go.

4584
04:37:17,830 --> 04:37:20,069
Much better.

4585
04:37:20,069 --> 04:37:22,069
Much better number.

4586
04:37:22,069 --> 04:37:27,939
Where is Wally?

4587
04:37:27,939 --> 04:37:31,400
Sleeping, right?

4588
04:37:31,400 --> 04:37:34,790
No, have a potato.

4589
04:37:37,669 --> 04:37:40,099
I love these potatoes.

4590
04:37:40,099 --> 04:37:42,099
It's just really easy to get them borrowed.

4591
04:37:42,099 --> 04:37:46,200
Enable Pog.

4592
04:37:46,200 --> 04:37:50,040
Well that means I have to get rid of something.

4593
04:37:50,040 --> 04:37:56,180
What am I going to get rid of?

4594
04:37:56,180 --> 04:37:58,180
I have five slots so I'm not going to get rid of anything.

4595
04:37:58,180 --> 04:38:00,180
I have to get rid of

4596
04:38:00,180 --> 04:38:02,180
FeelsBadMan.

4597
04:38:02,180 --> 04:38:05,639
I'm going to have to get rid of MonkaS.

4598
04:38:05,639 --> 04:38:07,639
I only get five.

4599
04:38:07,639 --> 04:38:19,220
Okay, very lively.

4600
04:38:19,220 --> 04:38:22,490
Yeah, you're good.

4601
04:38:22,490 --> 04:38:24,490
Okay, Wally's good for his tournament.

4602
04:38:37,479 --> 04:38:50,069
The February Cup.

4603
04:38:50,069 --> 04:38:52,069
Chavez, Agassiz,

4604
04:38:52,069 --> 04:38:54,819
and Yuki.

4605
04:38:54,819 --> 04:38:56,819
This is against Yuki.

4606
04:38:56,819 --> 04:39:01,939
Really low defense.

4607
04:39:01,939 --> 04:39:03,939
Not a threat.

4608
04:39:03,939 --> 04:39:07,259
Just do

4609
04:39:07,259 --> 04:39:09,259
just do physical attacks.

4610
04:39:09,259 --> 04:39:21,669
It's a little of these weird duck

4611
04:39:21,669 --> 04:39:24,549
dog hat combinations.

4612
04:39:24,549 --> 04:39:28,009
All right, Wally, show him.

4613
04:39:28,009 --> 04:39:34,150
Show him what you got.

4614
04:39:34,150 --> 04:39:36,840
Wally, what the fuck was that, Wally?

4615
04:39:36,840 --> 04:39:41,259
Wally!

4616
04:39:41,259 --> 04:39:50,200
Wally!

4617
04:39:50,200 --> 04:39:53,080
And now I can't hit him.

4618
04:39:53,080 --> 04:39:55,080
I got to stay in the middle.

4619
04:39:55,080 --> 04:39:57,080
Stay in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, because he has no moves for the mid range.

4620
04:39:57,080 --> 04:40:00,340
Pull him forward.

4621
04:40:00,340 --> 04:40:04,180
And now he's composed.

4622
04:40:04,180 --> 04:40:09,560
This is bad.

4623
04:40:09,560 --> 04:40:11,560
Come on, again, right off the bat. Do it, quick, quick, quick, again, again, again.

4624
04:40:11,560 --> 04:40:14,569
Yes!

4625
04:40:14,569 --> 04:40:27,689
Chavez and Agassiz.

4626
04:40:27,689 --> 04:40:33,299
Chavez win.

4627
04:40:33,299 --> 04:40:35,299
Yuki versus Chavez.

4628
04:40:35,299 --> 04:40:39,340
Not doing so good. Chavez is

4629
04:40:39,340 --> 04:40:41,770
the one to beat here, all right.

4630
04:40:41,770 --> 04:40:44,459
So, Agassiz.

4631
04:40:44,459 --> 04:40:46,819
High intelligence, high speed,

4632
04:40:46,819 --> 04:40:49,259
low defense.

4633
04:40:49,259 --> 04:40:51,259
Stay away from the magic abilities.

4634
04:40:51,259 --> 04:41:03,990
That's pretty much it.

4635
04:41:03,990 --> 04:41:07,700
Some of these cats.

4636
04:41:07,700 --> 04:41:09,700
All right, stay out of mid range, and

4637
04:41:09,700 --> 04:41:11,700
start immediately with the thing I

4638
04:41:11,700 --> 04:41:14,389
blocked.

4639
04:41:14,389 --> 04:41:16,389
High intelligence.

4640
04:41:16,389 --> 04:41:21,380
See what I mean here?

4641
04:41:21,380 --> 04:41:23,380
This is going to be hard.

4642
04:41:23,380 --> 04:41:25,380
38%, fuck me.

4643
04:41:25,380 --> 04:41:32,659
Stay forward.

4644
04:41:32,659 --> 04:41:39,450
There we go.

4645
04:41:39,450 --> 04:41:43,159
I don't have very much power, right?

4646
04:41:43,159 --> 04:41:47,500
I'm really dumb. No!

4647
04:41:47,500 --> 04:41:49,500
I forgot if this defense is so high.

4648
04:41:49,500 --> 04:41:53,590
At least I have a 200 defense.

4649
04:41:53,590 --> 04:42:02,680
Let's end it with the pop.

4650
04:42:02,680 --> 04:42:05,880
Come on, let me be flashy.

4651
04:42:05,880 --> 04:42:07,880
You're not going to let me be flashy?

4652
04:42:07,880 --> 04:42:11,909
22%.

4653
04:42:11,909 --> 04:42:13,909
I still got it.

4654
04:42:13,909 --> 04:42:24,599
Is that Mewtwo?

4655
04:42:24,599 --> 04:42:29,209
It's just a regular Mew.

4656
04:42:29,209 --> 04:42:32,599
All right, Chavez.

4657
04:42:32,599 --> 04:42:34,970
You're the...

4658
04:42:34,970 --> 04:42:36,970
Why are you so good?

4659
04:42:36,970 --> 04:42:40,360
Because you have good defense

4660
04:42:40,360 --> 04:42:43,299
and good power.

4661
04:42:43,299 --> 04:42:45,299
I have to hit you with intelligence stuff.

4662
04:42:45,299 --> 04:42:49,400
Yeah, I'm going to...

4663
04:42:49,400 --> 04:42:51,400
I'm going to try to burn you quick.

4664
04:42:51,400 --> 04:43:07,259
Rock Bunny.

4665
04:43:07,259 --> 04:43:09,259
Gotta go for this. See if I can hit it.

4666
04:43:09,259 --> 04:43:17,959
He sprays a bleed to it.

4667
04:43:17,959 --> 04:43:23,130
No.

4668
04:43:23,130 --> 04:43:36,040
Again.

4669
04:43:36,040 --> 04:43:45,189
That does more, somehow.

4670
04:43:45,189 --> 04:43:50,500
Try again.

4671
04:43:50,500 --> 04:43:52,810
Stay in mid-range.

4672
04:43:52,810 --> 04:43:54,979
Because he doesn't have shit in mid-range.

4673
04:43:54,979 --> 04:43:56,979
I'm going to bounce back and shoot him.

4674
04:43:56,979 --> 04:43:58,979
3, 2, 1, go.

4675
04:43:58,979 --> 04:44:04,659
Not good.

4676
04:44:04,659 --> 04:44:07,220
35% chance.

4677
04:44:07,220 --> 04:44:10,740
I'm going to hold on to my guts and not use it.

4678
04:44:10,740 --> 04:44:14,069
Have to win this one.

4679
04:44:14,069 --> 04:44:18,040
He's trying to bridge...

4680
04:44:18,040 --> 04:44:23,209
No!

4681
04:44:23,209 --> 04:44:26,090
20% chance to hit him.

4682
04:44:26,090 --> 04:44:28,779
Might just have to win this one by

4683
04:44:28,779 --> 04:44:30,779
playing defensively.

4684
04:44:30,779 --> 04:44:35,580
Can't go back any further over the wall.

4685
04:44:35,580 --> 04:44:44,009
Fall back.

4686
04:44:44,009 --> 04:44:46,819
One second left.

4687
04:44:46,819 --> 04:44:48,819
Do not do a move at the last second.

4688
04:44:48,819 --> 04:44:54,139
Judges?

4689
04:44:54,139 --> 04:44:56,139
Who wins?

4690
04:44:56,139 --> 04:45:01,509
I do!

4691
04:45:01,509 --> 04:45:10,340
Full-on victory. I like it.

4692
04:45:10,340 --> 04:45:12,340
Stalling tactics. Sometimes you've got to just

4693
04:45:12,340 --> 04:45:29,560
wear them out.

4694
04:45:29,560 --> 04:45:34,549
Please clap.

4695
04:45:34,549 --> 04:45:36,549
Not yet.

4696
04:45:36,549 --> 04:45:38,549
This is the final

4697
04:45:38,549 --> 04:45:41,180
tournament before I

4698
04:45:41,180 --> 04:45:43,180
can go into Seacup.

4699
04:45:43,180 --> 04:45:47,459
So we've got Lifeblade.

4700
04:45:47,459 --> 04:45:49,459
We should probably do this in the other...

4701
04:45:49,459 --> 04:45:51,459
Yeah. Rest first.

4702
04:45:51,459 --> 04:45:53,459
Do Lifeblade.

4703
04:45:53,459 --> 04:45:55,459
Maybe Lifeblade again.

4704
04:45:55,459 --> 04:45:57,459
This is the day of the tournament.

4705
04:45:57,459 --> 04:45:59,900
So you rest.

4706
04:45:59,900 --> 04:46:01,900
Nobody else has a tournament, right?

4707
04:46:01,900 --> 04:46:03,900
Rest.

4708
04:46:03,900 --> 04:46:05,900
Actually, you don't even need it.

4709
04:46:05,900 --> 04:46:07,900
Just do balance.

4710
04:46:11,900 --> 04:46:20,259
No defense.

4711
04:46:20,259 --> 04:46:22,259
Get in the tub.

4712
04:46:22,259 --> 04:46:24,259
Then you rest here.

4713
04:46:24,259 --> 04:46:26,569
You, on the other hand,

4714
04:46:26,569 --> 04:46:29,639
do the sandbag.

4715
04:46:29,639 --> 04:46:32,330
Get on

4716
04:46:32,330 --> 04:46:34,330
the trampoline

4717
04:46:34,330 --> 04:46:36,330
for speed.

4718
04:46:36,330 --> 04:46:38,330
And then you can rest here.

4719
04:46:38,330 --> 04:46:43,639
You're tired. Go to bed.

4720
04:46:43,639 --> 04:46:51,580
Begin!

4721
04:46:51,580 --> 04:46:53,580
Molly, you're just really not that good

4722
04:46:53,580 --> 04:46:56,459
with training.

4723
04:46:56,459 --> 04:46:59,340
It's just the fact. You're on the level 2

4724
04:46:59,340 --> 04:47:03,419
shit. What is this?

4725
04:47:03,419 --> 04:47:05,419
You were doing so good in the beginning.

4726
04:47:05,419 --> 04:47:15,130
I know you did

4727
04:47:15,130 --> 04:47:17,130
just win a tournament, but still.

4728
04:47:17,130 --> 04:47:21,099
I know you can do better.

4729
04:47:21,099 --> 04:47:23,099
He's trying his best. Yeah, but he's

4730
04:47:23,099 --> 04:47:25,400
been eating

4731
04:47:25,400 --> 04:47:27,400
bananas and shit all day.

4732
04:47:27,400 --> 04:47:30,020
Every day. You're doing just fine.

4733
04:47:30,020 --> 04:47:32,020
I will praise you, because

4734
04:47:32,020 --> 04:47:36,439
you just got 11 points.

4735
04:47:36,439 --> 04:47:38,439
You're a cruel and hateful person.

4736
04:47:38,439 --> 04:47:40,619
No, I'm not. You can't just

4737
04:47:40,619 --> 04:47:42,619
praise him every day. They turn

4738
04:47:42,619 --> 04:47:44,619
to shit. I did that

4739
04:47:44,619 --> 04:47:46,619
to beanbag Sonic, and he went

4740
04:47:46,619 --> 04:47:48,619
all the way to the other side of the scale.

4741
04:47:48,619 --> 04:47:50,860
And eventually he wouldn't even listen to me.

4742
04:47:50,860 --> 04:48:00,520
Remember?

4743
04:48:00,520 --> 04:48:04,099
Here. Here's your favorite thing.

4744
04:48:04,099 --> 04:48:08,520
I just

4745
04:48:08,520 --> 04:48:10,520
talked about how all he does is eat bananas, and I

4746
04:48:10,520 --> 04:48:13,139
just gave him one. That's fine.

4747
04:48:13,139 --> 04:48:15,139
We got a tournament coming up here, right?

4748
04:48:15,139 --> 04:48:17,700
How you doing? You sleeping?

4749
04:48:17,700 --> 04:48:20,900
You need to eat.

4750
04:48:20,900 --> 04:48:23,659
Oh, shit. I can't. Wait a minute. I can't do anything.

4751
04:48:23,659 --> 04:48:25,659
Oh, no.

4752
04:48:25,659 --> 04:48:28,919
That's not good.

4753
04:48:28,919 --> 04:48:34,419
Oh, that's alright.

4754
04:48:37,240 --> 04:48:43,450
Alright, you're good.

4755
04:48:43,450 --> 04:48:45,450
Let's give you some food.

4756
04:48:45,450 --> 04:48:47,450
It's a life blade

4757
04:48:47,450 --> 04:48:49,450
again for you. Life blade again.

4758
04:48:49,450 --> 04:48:51,450
Maybe you should rest.

4759
04:48:51,450 --> 04:48:53,450
Tub, rest.

4760
04:48:53,450 --> 04:48:55,450
Trampoline,

4761
04:48:55,450 --> 04:48:57,689
rest.

4762
04:48:57,689 --> 04:48:59,689
They're all doing just fine.

4763
04:48:59,689 --> 04:49:02,700
Bigot.

4764
04:49:02,700 --> 04:49:04,700
Saved the game. Yeah, I haven't saved the game in about

4765
04:49:04,700 --> 04:49:08,659
four hours. That's actually

4766
04:49:08,659 --> 04:49:10,659
really bad, you're right. That's awful.

4767
04:49:10,659 --> 04:49:12,659
Something bad is gonna happen though.

4768
04:49:14,659 --> 04:49:17,159
How do I even save

4769
04:49:17,159 --> 04:49:22,919
the game? Look how hungry you are.

4770
04:49:22,919 --> 04:49:24,919
Come on, I got you.

4771
04:49:28,619 --> 04:49:35,259
Are you full?

4772
04:49:35,259 --> 04:49:37,259
You're still hungry.

4773
04:49:37,259 --> 04:49:44,939
Here. Did you not literally learn a new

4774
04:49:44,939 --> 04:49:47,369
move? No, not yet. I have to bring them

4775
04:49:47,369 --> 04:49:49,369
into the adventure mode thing.

4776
04:49:49,369 --> 04:49:51,930
For them to learn new moves. I have to

4777
04:49:51,930 --> 04:49:53,930
do that. Okay, after bringing

4778
04:49:53,930 --> 04:49:56,299
um, after getting to rank C,

4779
04:49:56,299 --> 04:49:58,299
I have to get rumors

4780
04:49:58,299 --> 04:50:01,430
of a new move.

4781
04:50:06,869 --> 04:50:12,250
For this one, they made it so you have to push

4782
04:50:12,250 --> 04:50:14,250
reset on the console to save.

4783
04:50:14,250 --> 04:50:16,490
That's really weird.

4784
04:50:18,490 --> 04:50:22,069
Wasn't it somewhere in like

4785
04:50:22,069 --> 04:50:24,069
weekend calendar? Where was it?

4786
04:50:24,069 --> 04:50:26,069
Reader? Book?

4787
04:50:26,069 --> 04:50:28,069
Isn't it like at the very beginning of each week?

4788
04:50:28,069 --> 04:50:30,700
Yeah, it's at the beginning of each week.

4789
04:50:36,380 --> 04:50:40,659
Hey Jerma, got your nose.

4790
04:50:42,659 --> 04:50:44,659
You don't, no you don't.

4791
04:50:44,659 --> 04:50:46,659
It's still on my face.

4792
04:50:46,659 --> 04:50:48,659
I'm not stupid.

4793
04:50:54,099 --> 04:50:56,099
There we go.

4794
04:50:56,099 --> 04:51:00,069
Saving game. Turn on the face cam.

4795
04:51:00,069 --> 04:51:02,069
What if I turn the face cam on and I

4796
04:51:02,069 --> 04:51:04,069
this whole time was having Voldemort

4797
04:51:04,069 --> 04:51:06,310
style makeup put on me.

4798
04:51:06,310 --> 04:51:08,310
And that was just a plant in chat to write that.

4799
04:51:08,310 --> 04:51:10,310
And I just had this flat fucking

4800
04:51:10,310 --> 04:51:12,310
no, nothing there.

4801
04:51:12,310 --> 04:51:14,680
I just start screaming.

4802
04:51:14,680 --> 04:51:16,680
Screaming as loud as I can.

4803
04:51:16,680 --> 04:51:21,779
And then I turn the stream off.

4804
04:51:21,779 --> 04:51:23,779
April fools.

4805
04:51:23,779 --> 04:51:26,340
Alright, here we go.

4806
04:51:26,340 --> 04:51:28,340
You have a tournament today.

4807
04:51:28,340 --> 04:51:30,340
You're kind of tired though.

4808
04:51:30,340 --> 04:51:33,209
Just rest.

4809
04:51:33,209 --> 04:51:35,209
You are, you need to rest.

4810
04:51:35,209 --> 04:51:37,209
You're frustrated that it's okay.

4811
04:51:37,209 --> 04:51:39,770
Everyone's resting today.

4812
04:51:39,770 --> 04:51:41,770
Or just go to bed.

4813
04:51:41,770 --> 04:51:47,529
That would be the greatest thing I've ever seen.

4814
04:51:47,529 --> 04:51:55,340
And have a potato.

4815
04:51:57,340 --> 04:52:02,900
Jerma, please read this. I want to be the one guy.

4816
04:52:02,900 --> 04:52:08,540
Your wish is my command.

4817
04:52:08,540 --> 04:52:15,450
Alright.

4818
04:52:15,450 --> 04:52:19,029
Final tournament.

4819
04:52:19,029 --> 04:52:21,029
Before I can do the

4820
04:52:21,029 --> 04:52:23,029
rank up. Let's hope I win.

4821
04:52:23,029 --> 04:52:27,319
And then

4822
04:52:27,319 --> 04:52:29,319
we're that much closer to C rank. We're in C rank

4823
04:52:29,319 --> 04:52:31,319
after that. Next one.

4824
04:52:31,319 --> 04:52:42,459
Rumor, Fate, Bernard,

4825
04:52:42,459 --> 04:52:44,459
and Garganny.

4826
04:52:44,459 --> 04:52:47,209
Versus Fate.

4827
04:52:47,209 --> 04:52:51,750
Tons of life.

4828
04:52:51,750 --> 04:52:53,750
Not really that much of anything else.

4829
04:52:53,750 --> 04:52:58,490
Just high health, that's all.

4830
04:52:58,490 --> 04:53:02,389
And then I'm gonna take them all

4831
04:53:02,389 --> 04:53:05,139
exploring for the next month.

4832
04:53:05,139 --> 04:53:14,040
Just gotta hit hard.

4833
04:53:14,040 --> 04:53:17,299
Good start.

4834
04:53:17,299 --> 04:53:20,380
Good start. You got nothing in the back.

4835
04:53:20,380 --> 04:53:22,380
54%. Let's give it a try.

4836
04:53:26,020 --> 04:53:28,779
Helicopter. Good luck.

4837
04:53:28,779 --> 04:53:33,259
Look at all my guts.

4838
04:53:33,259 --> 04:53:35,500
He can't even do any moves.

4839
04:53:35,500 --> 04:53:37,500
Did he use everything to try to do that?

4840
04:53:39,500 --> 04:53:46,409
Just kill him.

4841
04:53:46,409 --> 04:53:54,090
I had a nightmare about this thing.

4842
04:53:54,090 --> 04:53:59,020
Hey Jerma, tell a funny joke.

4843
04:53:59,020 --> 04:54:03,110
Nah, I got nothing, sorry.

4844
04:54:03,110 --> 04:54:05,110
Sorry. No jokes tonight.

4845
04:54:05,110 --> 04:54:09,209
Alright Bernard.

4846
04:54:09,209 --> 04:54:14,709
Not that special, just a lot of health.

4847
04:54:14,709 --> 04:54:19,380
The no joke joke.

4848
04:54:19,380 --> 04:54:22,259
That's the one.

4849
04:54:22,259 --> 04:54:28,919
Jerma lied about funny joke.

4850
04:54:28,919 --> 04:54:30,919
That is fucking terrifying.

4851
04:54:30,919 --> 04:54:33,220
It's just a giant mouth.

4852
04:54:33,220 --> 04:54:42,700
That's just Pac-Man.

4853
04:54:42,700 --> 04:54:44,700
That's Pac-Man with dentures in him.

4854
04:54:44,700 --> 04:54:50,389
In the back, that's a good backspin.

4855
04:54:50,389 --> 04:54:53,959
It's been good, but...

4856
04:54:53,959 --> 04:54:59,139
Try again.

4857
04:54:59,139 --> 04:55:11,430
There's two coin flips in a row.

4858
04:55:11,430 --> 04:55:13,860
He doesn't have very many guts.

4859
04:55:13,860 --> 04:55:15,860
Oh man, that's not good. What was his defense at?

4860
04:55:15,860 --> 04:55:19,000
This is gonna come down to the end.

4861
04:55:19,000 --> 04:55:21,000
I have to win this one.

4862
04:55:21,000 --> 04:55:23,369
26.

4863
04:55:23,369 --> 04:55:27,979
It's gonna be one hit for whoever.

4864
04:55:27,979 --> 04:55:29,979
I gotta go for one in the back.

4865
04:55:29,979 --> 04:55:32,599
I had to do it.

4866
04:55:32,599 --> 04:55:35,779
Fuck.

4867
04:55:35,779 --> 04:55:43,060
I can still do this.

4868
04:55:43,060 --> 04:55:45,060
He's trying to close the gap.

4869
04:55:45,060 --> 04:55:47,060
Oh no.

4870
04:55:47,060 --> 04:55:49,240
That's it.

4871
04:55:49,240 --> 04:55:52,250
I get to do this thing.

4872
04:55:52,250 --> 04:55:54,250
What? No.

4873
04:55:54,250 --> 04:55:56,740
Are you serious?

4874
04:55:56,740 --> 04:56:00,520
He's got nothing in the back.

4875
04:56:00,520 --> 04:56:02,889
Do it.

4876
04:56:02,889 --> 04:56:04,889
You are killing me with this bullshit.

4877
04:56:04,889 --> 04:56:11,529
This is bad, I'm gonna lose.

4878
04:56:11,529 --> 04:56:14,020
Get back, back, back, back, back.

4879
04:56:14,020 --> 04:56:16,020
In the middle, right in the middle, right in the middle.

4880
04:56:16,020 --> 04:56:19,290
How many guts do I have?

4881
04:56:19,290 --> 04:56:21,290
Come on, I need 15 guts.

4882
04:56:21,290 --> 04:56:23,290
11, 12, 13, 14.

4883
04:56:25,290 --> 04:56:34,060
That's how bad I lose.

4884
04:56:34,060 --> 04:56:49,590
Just missed half the attacks I did.

4885
04:56:49,590 --> 04:56:51,590
My stats are way better than that, guys.

4886
04:56:51,590 --> 04:56:56,069
I have like 200 attack.

4887
04:56:56,069 --> 04:57:03,880
I just had to throw my dice in the air and lose.

4888
04:57:07,529 --> 04:57:09,529
And his accuracy is almost as much as his attack power.

4889
04:57:09,529 --> 04:57:12,659
He has like 200 accuracy.

4890
04:57:12,659 --> 04:57:14,659
What the fuck?

4891
04:57:14,659 --> 04:57:17,540
Look at this.

4892
04:57:17,540 --> 04:57:19,540
You're at 170 accuracy and you still are at like 30-45%.

4893
04:57:21,540 --> 04:57:26,090
How much more points do I have to put into this?

4894
04:57:26,090 --> 04:57:29,099
Look at the speed, accuracy.

4895
04:57:29,099 --> 04:57:31,099
That's like one of his top three.

4896
04:57:31,099 --> 04:57:40,759
I gotta get him a new move.

4897
04:57:40,759 --> 04:57:45,619
Alright, no more tournaments.

4898
04:57:45,619 --> 04:57:49,779
You need a new move.

4899
04:57:49,779 --> 04:57:51,779
Something for the mid-range.

4900
04:58:01,259 --> 04:58:03,259
Yeah, you're all coming with me.

4901
04:58:03,259 --> 04:58:05,619
Let's go.

4902
04:58:09,849 --> 04:58:13,110
Trampoline at speed.

4903
04:58:13,110 --> 04:58:15,110
Let's do it again.

4904
04:58:15,110 --> 04:58:17,110
Target.

4905
04:58:17,110 --> 04:58:19,110
Target is fine.

4906
04:58:19,110 --> 04:58:21,110
This is the top right.

4907
04:58:23,110 --> 04:58:25,610
And then you don't need to rest.

4908
04:58:27,610 --> 04:58:31,130
Stand back.

4909
04:58:31,130 --> 04:58:33,130
And then we're going to explore a cave.

4910
04:58:33,130 --> 04:58:38,500
Plus 16.

4911
04:58:38,500 --> 04:58:43,299
That was actually really good.

4912
04:58:43,299 --> 04:58:49,770
Alright, everyone's kind of hungry.

4913
04:58:49,770 --> 04:58:55,770
Except for you, you're fine.

4914
04:58:55,770 --> 04:58:57,770
You're frustrated and hungry.

4915
04:59:00,709 --> 04:59:07,669
Nevermind.

4916
04:59:07,669 --> 04:59:12,340
Why don't you, the biggest monster, eat the others?

4917
04:59:16,340 --> 04:59:22,169
The brightness on your phone is low.

4918
04:59:25,819 --> 04:59:29,779
I was unaware.

4919
04:59:29,779 --> 04:59:31,779
Alright, adventure.

4920
04:59:31,779 --> 04:59:36,709
Take monster, being raised, exploring.

4921
04:59:36,709 --> 04:59:40,299
Caves.

4922
04:59:40,299 --> 04:59:42,299
I'm coming. All of you.

4923
04:59:45,560 --> 04:59:47,560
746 start adventure.

4924
04:59:47,560 --> 05:00:01,000
Hey Jermey, is your refrigerator running?

4925
05:00:01,000 --> 05:00:04,200
Yeah, it grew legs.

4926
05:00:04,200 --> 05:00:06,200
And sprinted out of my house.

4927
05:00:06,200 --> 05:00:08,200
And just sprint punched my roommate in the face.

4928
05:00:08,200 --> 05:00:11,659
And started pissing all over my couch.

4929
05:00:11,659 --> 05:00:13,659
And rolling around on the ground and shit.

4930
05:00:13,659 --> 05:00:20,119
And then it had been in a Kool-Aid band outside.

4931
05:00:20,119 --> 05:00:22,119
As hard as it could into my wall.

4932
05:00:22,119 --> 05:00:24,119
There was glass and stuff. It was fucked up.

4933
05:00:24,119 --> 05:00:26,119
I'm glad you noticed it.

4934
05:00:26,119 --> 05:00:37,509
Then you better go catch it!

4935
05:00:37,509 --> 05:00:39,509
Yeah, I really should, shouldn't I?

4936
05:00:39,509 --> 05:00:43,669
You can't keep doing this stuff and blaming your fridge.

4937
05:00:45,669 --> 05:00:58,709
Here we go. Random battle.

4938
05:00:58,709 --> 05:01:03,770
Somebody's asked me if he's the fountain of youth bullshit.

4939
05:01:03,770 --> 05:01:08,250
I don't probably.

4940
05:01:08,250 --> 05:01:10,549
I have no idea.

4941
05:01:12,549 --> 05:01:15,430
He's dead instantly.

4942
05:01:15,430 --> 05:01:22,340
He finally read it. What do you mean he finally read it?

4943
05:01:22,340 --> 05:01:24,580
Level 2, Vroomer.

4944
05:01:24,580 --> 05:01:26,759
Anything new? What did you get?

4945
05:01:26,759 --> 05:01:28,759
Vroomer obtained Hard Head.

4946
05:01:28,759 --> 05:01:30,759
Vroomer mastered Charge.

4947
05:01:30,759 --> 05:01:34,220
Obtained Nunchaku.

4948
05:01:37,349 --> 05:01:42,729
Nice. New move.

4949
05:01:42,729 --> 05:01:53,290
He's been saying that for like 2 hours.

4950
05:01:53,290 --> 05:01:57,639
Why?

4951
05:01:57,639 --> 05:02:01,290
I don't know. What is that?

4952
05:02:01,290 --> 05:02:03,909
Let me take a look at the data.

4953
05:02:03,909 --> 05:02:05,909
Okay, so we got Charge now.

4954
05:02:05,909 --> 05:02:07,909
This is Charge.

4955
05:02:07,909 --> 05:02:09,909
17 guts.

4956
05:02:09,909 --> 05:02:11,909
Life damage is C.

4957
05:02:11,909 --> 05:02:13,909
Critical hit rating. Accuracies.

4958
05:02:13,909 --> 05:02:15,909
Guts damage.

4959
05:02:15,909 --> 05:02:17,909
It's more accurate than anything I have.

4960
05:02:17,909 --> 05:02:19,909
Except for this.

4961
05:02:19,909 --> 05:02:21,909
It's pretty cheap to do.

4962
05:02:21,909 --> 05:02:23,909
It's cheaper to do than this.

4963
05:02:23,909 --> 05:02:26,279
A little bit less damage than this.

4964
05:02:28,279 --> 05:02:30,279
But, it is

4965
05:02:30,279 --> 05:02:32,279
fairly accurate. Move kind of terrible.

4966
05:02:32,279 --> 05:02:35,029
Alright, he got Hard Head too.

4967
05:02:35,029 --> 05:02:37,029
What the hell is Hard Head?

4968
05:02:41,400 --> 05:02:43,830
Wind Lore.

4969
05:02:43,830 --> 05:02:45,830
Ups wind and fire power and lets you

4970
05:02:45,830 --> 05:02:47,830
add a wind power to skill.

4971
05:02:47,830 --> 05:02:49,830
Does it.

4972
05:02:49,830 --> 05:02:51,830
Increases power of moves that use the head.

4973
05:02:51,830 --> 05:03:08,840
Okay.

4974
05:03:08,840 --> 05:03:10,840
All these streams are Jerva saying

4975
05:03:10,840 --> 05:03:12,840
dumb stuff and chat repeating it.

4976
05:03:12,840 --> 05:03:24,040
Wait, what?

4977
05:03:24,040 --> 05:03:26,040
What was the dumb thing that I said today?

4978
05:03:26,040 --> 05:03:28,040
I didn't say anything dumb.

4979
05:03:28,040 --> 05:03:36,279
What did I say now?

4980
05:03:36,279 --> 05:03:45,560
The refrigerator running

4981
05:03:45,560 --> 05:03:54,069
thing?

4982
05:03:54,069 --> 05:04:01,049
Did I hit this guy?

4983
05:04:01,049 --> 05:04:17,479
Most level 2 for the other ones.

4984
05:04:17,479 --> 05:04:19,479
I need to equip the skill.

4985
05:04:19,479 --> 05:04:21,849
It's not there.

4986
05:04:27,849 --> 05:04:29,849
Oh, I see.

4987
05:04:31,849 --> 05:04:33,849
Okay, so this is slot 1.

4988
05:04:33,849 --> 05:04:35,849
I can't have

4989
05:04:35,849 --> 05:04:37,849
these.

4990
05:04:37,849 --> 05:04:40,220
Okay, so that is a

4991
05:04:40,220 --> 05:04:42,220
move in the front, short range. Alright.

4992
05:04:44,840 --> 05:04:47,659
And backspin is going to be

4993
05:04:47,659 --> 05:04:49,659
in the back.

4994
05:04:49,659 --> 05:04:51,659
Okay, so I'll just go like this in case I want to use it.

4995
05:04:53,659 --> 05:04:57,110
Okay, makes sense.

4996
05:04:57,110 --> 05:05:03,189
It's not April Fools yet.

4997
05:05:03,189 --> 05:05:05,189
Well, it is April Fools on East Coast at the moment.

4998
05:05:05,189 --> 05:05:13,000
So watch out for people playing tricks.

4999
05:05:13,000 --> 05:05:18,060
So I'm going to do something funny.

5000
05:05:18,060 --> 05:05:20,619
And you're going to believe them.

5001
05:05:20,619 --> 05:05:26,119
Let's try the new move, Charge.

5002
05:05:26,119 --> 05:05:30,259
I'm a little too bullish.

5003
05:05:30,259 --> 05:05:32,759
Still a little too bullish.

5004
05:05:32,759 --> 05:05:35,259
You're going to die in here.

5005
05:05:35,259 --> 05:05:40,169
It's pretty good move.

5006
05:05:40,169 --> 05:05:42,169
It's got a high hit percentage too it seems.

5007
05:05:42,169 --> 05:05:44,979
I'm going to take you out.

5008
05:05:44,979 --> 05:05:47,740
Get out of here.

5009
05:05:47,740 --> 05:05:57,130
You died. Last hit, that's good.

5010
05:05:57,130 --> 05:06:03,020
All the gifted subs are April Fools jokes?

5011
05:06:03,020 --> 05:06:06,470
Well, that would be

5012
05:06:06,470 --> 05:06:08,470
pretty weird.

5013
05:06:08,470 --> 05:06:12,950
Ah, almost.

5014
05:06:12,950 --> 05:06:17,180
Another toy robot.

5015
05:06:17,180 --> 05:06:19,799
This thing is stupid.

5016
05:06:24,330 --> 05:06:26,500
Actually stupid.

5017
05:06:26,500 --> 05:06:30,220
Doesn't even do anything.

5018
05:06:30,220 --> 05:06:32,970
Why am I going that way? I'm wasting energy.

5019
05:06:32,970 --> 05:06:46,389
Alright, next floor.

5020
05:06:46,389 --> 05:06:48,389
They should level up the other two and maybe they'll get some new stuff.

5021
05:06:48,389 --> 05:06:59,779
There we go.

5022
05:06:59,779 --> 05:07:04,439
Just don't even let them get up.

5023
05:07:04,439 --> 05:07:06,439
Keep doing it.

5024
05:07:06,439 --> 05:07:09,770
70%.

5025
05:07:09,770 --> 05:07:13,290
Nice.

5026
05:07:13,290 --> 05:07:15,290
Alright, here comes the new skills.

5027
05:07:15,290 --> 05:07:17,779
For level two.

5028
05:07:17,779 --> 05:07:20,900
And?

5029
05:07:20,900 --> 05:07:22,900
Wally obtained a sniper.

5030
05:07:22,900 --> 05:07:25,529
Roberto obtained

5031
05:07:25,529 --> 05:07:27,959
heavy armor.

5032
05:07:27,959 --> 05:07:31,290
And got a junk toy.

5033
05:07:31,290 --> 05:07:33,979
Really, let's see what that is.

5034
05:07:36,220 --> 05:07:38,220
Nope.

5035
05:07:38,220 --> 05:07:40,220
Sniper.

5036
05:07:40,220 --> 05:07:42,220
Increases power of moves that throw

5037
05:07:42,220 --> 05:07:45,290
or shoot.

5038
05:07:45,290 --> 05:07:47,290
So that's going to be much better.

5039
05:07:47,290 --> 05:07:49,290
For this move here.

5040
05:07:51,290 --> 05:07:53,459
This cracker.

5041
05:07:53,459 --> 05:07:56,150
No new

5042
05:07:56,150 --> 05:07:58,150
ability though, unfortunately.

5043
05:07:58,150 --> 05:08:01,479
Alright, what about um, Roberto?

5044
05:08:01,479 --> 05:08:03,479
No move, it was something else. Heavy armor.

5045
05:08:03,479 --> 05:08:05,479
Reduces damage but harder to dodge.

5046
05:08:05,479 --> 05:08:07,479
Okay.

5047
05:08:07,479 --> 05:08:14,060
No new moves for either one of them.

5048
05:08:14,060 --> 05:08:25,770
Alright, so what do you guys think?

5049
05:08:25,770 --> 05:08:27,770
We've been playing for about

5050
05:08:27,770 --> 05:08:29,770
just over five hours.

5051
05:08:29,770 --> 05:08:33,029
Do you want to keep seeing this?

5052
05:08:33,029 --> 05:08:35,029
I think I'm going to continue playing.

5053
05:08:35,029 --> 05:08:50,709
This is branching like crazy.

5054
05:08:50,709 --> 05:08:57,819
Found the chest.

5055
05:08:57,819 --> 05:09:00,819
Got a new move and we found

5056
05:09:00,819 --> 05:09:03,189
document five.

5057
05:09:03,189 --> 05:09:06,709
What the hell is document five?

5058
05:09:06,709 --> 05:09:12,860
Found the

5059
05:09:12,860 --> 05:09:14,860
Fitz Lenderman page.

5060
05:09:14,860 --> 05:09:17,479
Is there any movies lately?

5061
05:09:17,479 --> 05:09:19,479
I've seen...

5062
05:09:19,479 --> 05:09:21,479
The last movie I saw was in the Spiderverse.

5063
05:09:21,479 --> 05:09:24,099
The last one I saw in theaters.

5064
05:09:24,099 --> 05:09:32,279
What is this?

5065
05:09:32,279 --> 05:09:34,279
Rumor can't help you investigate.

5066
05:09:34,279 --> 05:09:38,759
Anybody else?

5067
05:09:38,759 --> 05:09:41,450
One of you guys can do this.

5068
05:09:41,450 --> 05:09:44,520
Wally can't help you investigate.

5069
05:09:44,520 --> 05:09:47,779
Nobody can dig.

5070
05:09:47,779 --> 05:09:50,020
A sword is a shovel.

5071
05:09:50,020 --> 05:10:02,380
Why not Captain Marvel?

5072
05:10:02,380 --> 05:10:04,380
I just haven't had a chance to go

5073
05:10:04,380 --> 05:10:15,259
to the movies.

5074
05:10:15,259 --> 05:10:17,750
Do I dare go down?

5075
05:10:17,750 --> 05:10:19,750
Do I dare go down again?

5076
05:10:19,750 --> 05:10:23,340
542, that's not bad.

5077
05:10:23,340 --> 05:10:30,360
Let's see what's on third floor.

5078
05:10:30,360 --> 05:10:42,139
Roberto is way too loud.

5079
05:10:42,139 --> 05:10:44,569
Yeah, he kind of is.

5080
05:10:44,569 --> 05:10:46,569
They all are though.

5081
05:10:46,569 --> 05:10:48,569
They all have a really loud single audio file

5082
05:10:48,569 --> 05:10:53,619
that plays when they make a step.

5083
05:10:53,619 --> 05:10:55,619
A big money just came in.

5084
05:10:55,619 --> 05:10:58,060
And community size.

5085
05:10:58,060 --> 05:11:01,000
You guys are just

5086
05:11:01,000 --> 05:11:04,330
showering me with money.

5087
05:11:04,330 --> 05:11:06,330
You guys are just dropping money

5088
05:11:06,330 --> 05:11:08,700
into my vacuum clinic.

5089
05:11:08,700 --> 05:11:11,259
Let me pause this. Hold on.

5090
05:11:11,259 --> 05:11:13,750
General lied about Minecraft.

5091
05:11:13,750 --> 05:11:15,750
We have five community subs. First of all, thank you.

5092
05:11:15,750 --> 05:11:17,750
And then

5093
05:11:17,750 --> 05:11:21,080
Gopher yourself

5094
05:11:21,080 --> 05:11:23,080
gave sixty dollars.

5095
05:11:23,080 --> 05:11:28,200
Thank you Gopher.

5096
05:11:28,200 --> 05:11:33,000
It's sixty bucks

5097
05:11:33,000 --> 05:11:35,430
six thousand bits.

5098
05:11:35,430 --> 05:11:37,430
How did this streamer beat the demon of hatred on the first try?

5099
05:11:37,430 --> 05:11:39,430
But die to my

5100
05:11:39,430 --> 05:11:41,430
elderly neighbor Bernard.

5101
05:11:41,430 --> 05:11:43,430
I love this silly streamer. Ha ha.

5102
05:11:43,430 --> 05:11:48,299
There's so much misinformation in that.

5103
05:11:48,299 --> 05:11:50,299
Two sentences.

5104
05:11:50,299 --> 05:11:55,610
But thank you Gopher.

5105
05:11:55,610 --> 05:11:59,450
Thank you with sixty bucks.

5106
05:11:59,450 --> 05:12:14,069
Funny lad.

5107
05:12:14,069 --> 05:12:16,069
Rhino, Rhino Ryan.

5108
05:12:16,069 --> 05:12:20,619
That's kind of cool. It's like a squirtle Mewtwo.

5109
05:12:24,259 --> 05:12:27,779
When do you think he'll get a sword slash?

5110
05:12:27,779 --> 05:12:29,779
I think he's going to take it to level four or five to get it.

5111
05:12:29,779 --> 05:12:35,540
Jeremy, do you know if your earwax is brown

5112
05:12:35,540 --> 05:12:37,540
it means you're stressed out?

5113
05:12:37,540 --> 05:12:40,360
Well my earwax is

5114
05:12:40,360 --> 05:12:42,360
when I put like a little thing in my ear

5115
05:12:42,360 --> 05:12:45,299
The room is almost level three.

5116
05:12:45,299 --> 05:12:48,700
Silver coin.

5117
05:12:48,700 --> 05:12:50,700
When I do a little

5118
05:12:50,700 --> 05:12:52,700
earwax thing, you know

5119
05:12:52,700 --> 05:12:54,700
a q-tip or something. I know you're not supposed to.

5120
05:12:54,700 --> 05:12:56,700
But I do it anyways.

5121
05:12:56,700 --> 05:12:59,450
I can't help it.

5122
05:12:59,450 --> 05:13:01,750
That the entire q-tip industry

5123
05:13:01,750 --> 05:13:04,060
only survives

5124
05:13:04,060 --> 05:13:06,060
only because people do the

5125
05:13:06,060 --> 05:13:08,060
thing they're not supposed to do with a q-tip.

5126
05:13:08,060 --> 05:13:16,700
Put it in your ear.

5127
05:13:16,700 --> 05:13:19,639
But it's like

5128
05:13:19,639 --> 05:13:22,900
they never do anything.

5129
05:13:22,900 --> 05:13:25,909
It's always very clean.

5130
05:13:25,909 --> 05:13:27,909
What I typically like to do is in the shower

5131
05:13:27,909 --> 05:13:29,909
I do a little bit of washcloth

5132
05:13:29,909 --> 05:13:31,909
and I go in the ear and move it around

5133
05:13:31,909 --> 05:13:33,909
so I don't go deep in.

5134
05:13:36,599 --> 05:13:45,299
Always clean.

5135
05:13:45,299 --> 05:13:48,569
Just double tap that guy.

5136
05:13:48,569 --> 05:13:50,569
Jeremy only reads gross and rude comments.

5137
05:13:50,569 --> 05:13:52,740
That's not even true though.

5138
05:13:52,740 --> 05:13:54,740
How many things

5139
05:13:54,740 --> 05:13:56,740
have I said this stream

5140
05:13:56,740 --> 05:13:58,740
that were just responding to questions?

5141
05:13:58,740 --> 05:14:02,709
I'm just responding to

5142
05:14:02,709 --> 05:14:04,709
questions.

5143
05:14:04,709 --> 05:14:15,400
And comments people have.

5144
05:14:15,400 --> 05:14:17,400
I gotta get out of here soon.

5145
05:14:17,400 --> 05:14:25,529
I'm at 472.

5146
05:14:25,529 --> 05:14:27,959
That's a sword.

5147
05:14:27,959 --> 05:14:32,569
Goldal sword?

5148
05:14:32,569 --> 05:14:34,569
Can I put items on in this game?

5149
05:14:34,569 --> 05:14:38,599
What do I do with that?

5150
05:14:38,599 --> 05:14:49,860
Maybe I can just sell it?

5151
05:14:49,860 --> 05:14:53,900
How fast can I dab?

5152
05:14:53,900 --> 05:14:55,900
I don't know. I haven't tracked it.

5153
05:14:55,900 --> 05:14:57,900
I don't have a radar gun to track how fast

5154
05:14:57,900 --> 05:15:04,169
my dabs are.

5155
05:15:04,169 --> 05:15:06,169
If I'm gonna take a guess though, I would say

5156
05:15:06,169 --> 05:15:08,169
probably like 600

5157
05:15:08,169 --> 05:15:10,169
probably 60-50

5158
05:15:10,169 --> 05:15:13,880
miles per hour.

5159
05:15:13,880 --> 05:15:16,250
If I had a radar gun pointed at me.

5160
05:15:16,250 --> 05:15:18,740
Look at this guy.

5161
05:15:18,740 --> 05:15:22,970
Whoa.

5162
05:15:22,970 --> 05:15:24,970
I kinda want this praying mantis person.

5163
05:15:24,970 --> 05:15:31,689
He probably has a ton of speed.

5164
05:15:31,689 --> 05:15:40,569
Sit down.

5165
05:15:40,569 --> 05:15:42,569
Just measure it in DPS.

5166
05:15:42,569 --> 05:15:44,569
Dabs. DPM.

5167
05:15:44,569 --> 05:15:55,580
Dab for a minute.

5168
05:15:55,580 --> 05:15:57,580
Do you think that's ever gonna go away?

5169
05:15:57,580 --> 05:15:59,580
Do you think anyone's ever gonna stop dabbing?

5170
05:15:59,580 --> 05:16:08,860
Transition out.

5171
05:16:08,860 --> 05:16:11,099
It has to be soon, right?

5172
05:16:11,099 --> 05:16:13,720
Okay, level three.

5173
05:16:13,720 --> 05:16:15,720
Roberto obtains

5174
05:16:15,720 --> 05:16:17,900
super weapon.

5175
05:16:17,900 --> 05:16:19,900
Vroomer obtains sniper.

5176
05:16:19,900 --> 05:16:21,900
Roberto mastered swing.

5177
05:16:21,900 --> 05:16:30,860
Okay, finally we can swing the sword.

5178
05:16:30,860 --> 05:16:32,860
Yeah, I ain't gonna lie. Look at Roberto's stats.

5179
05:16:32,860 --> 05:16:37,849
They're actually getting pretty good.

5180
05:16:37,849 --> 05:16:39,849
Okay, let's go into this one here.

5181
05:16:39,849 --> 05:16:41,849
There it is. Swing.

5182
05:16:41,849 --> 05:16:44,090
Life damage C. Accuracy

5183
05:16:44,090 --> 05:16:46,090
rating S.

5184
05:16:46,090 --> 05:16:50,180
This thing will never miss.

5185
05:16:50,180 --> 05:16:52,740
Exactly what I need.

5186
05:16:52,740 --> 05:16:54,979
He just became the character we're gonna be playing with.

5187
05:16:54,979 --> 05:16:56,979
So that takes over

5188
05:16:56,979 --> 05:16:58,979
for kick.

5189
05:16:58,979 --> 05:17:00,979
Yeah, he's got something else too, right?

5190
05:17:00,979 --> 05:17:02,979
Super weapon.

5191
05:17:02,979 --> 05:17:04,979
Increases power of moves

5192
05:17:04,979 --> 05:17:06,979
that use the weapon.

5193
05:17:06,979 --> 05:17:09,799
Nice.

5194
05:17:09,799 --> 05:17:11,799
And then what did I get for...

5195
05:17:11,799 --> 05:17:14,680
I got something else.

5196
05:17:14,680 --> 05:17:19,220
Vroomer, right?

5197
05:17:19,220 --> 05:17:21,900
Sniper.

5198
05:17:21,900 --> 05:17:24,459
Throwing and shooting.

5199
05:17:24,459 --> 05:17:26,819
What counts as that for here?

5200
05:17:26,819 --> 05:17:28,819
Does the backdash count as a throw?

5201
05:17:28,819 --> 05:17:34,630
Charge, backspin,

5202
05:17:34,630 --> 05:17:36,630
with type far range.

5203
05:17:36,630 --> 05:17:39,000
This is a throw?

5204
05:17:39,000 --> 05:17:41,000
This is probably a throw, right?

5205
05:17:41,000 --> 05:17:48,540
I do assume.

5206
05:17:48,540 --> 05:17:51,349
Cool, alright. Well, now they're getting a lot better.

5207
05:17:51,349 --> 05:17:54,099
Just kinda had to do this.

5208
05:17:54,099 --> 05:18:04,599
Oh shit, what is this?

5209
05:18:04,599 --> 05:18:08,759
In the cutscene here.

5210
05:18:08,759 --> 05:18:11,380
What was my last toaster strudel I ate?

5211
05:18:11,380 --> 05:18:15,099
I don't eat toaster strudels.

5212
05:18:15,099 --> 05:18:17,099
So I go by the box

5213
05:18:17,099 --> 05:18:19,099
and you know how the icing is all kind of

5214
05:18:19,099 --> 05:18:21,099
attached, connected like a...

5215
05:18:21,099 --> 05:18:23,099
almost like they're on a string together?

5216
05:18:23,099 --> 05:18:25,099
Well, I take a pair of scissors and

5217
05:18:25,099 --> 05:18:27,099
at the very top of the icing

5218
05:18:27,099 --> 05:18:29,099
there's a little nub

5219
05:18:29,099 --> 05:18:31,099
that you're supposed to squeeze the icing out of.

5220
05:18:31,099 --> 05:18:33,099
So I take a pair of scissors and I cut across

5221
05:18:33,099 --> 05:18:35,099
every single part of the strand of icing

5222
05:18:35,099 --> 05:18:37,099
packets.

5223
05:18:37,099 --> 05:18:39,099
So they're all cut off at the top of the nub.

5224
05:18:39,099 --> 05:18:41,099
And then it's about, I think it's eight

5225
05:18:41,099 --> 05:18:43,099
packets that are connected.

5226
05:18:43,099 --> 05:18:45,099
They're all on top of each other.

5227
05:18:45,099 --> 05:18:47,099
Turn it upside down. Squeeze all eight

5228
05:18:47,099 --> 05:18:49,099
packets at the same time.

5229
05:18:49,099 --> 05:18:51,099
And just drain the icing.

5230
05:18:51,099 --> 05:18:53,270
All eight packages.

5231
05:18:53,270 --> 05:18:58,009
And then I throw the box in the trash.

5232
05:18:58,009 --> 05:19:09,979
What, that's not, is that not normal?

5233
05:19:09,979 --> 05:19:11,979
There's something about this, it's strange. My old friend

5234
05:19:11,979 --> 05:19:14,860
can you hear me?

5235
05:19:14,860 --> 05:19:17,099
Hello, old friend. Who is that?

5236
05:19:17,099 --> 05:19:19,849
Much time has passed since your

5237
05:19:19,849 --> 05:19:22,090
former adventure. But it seems the world

5238
05:19:22,090 --> 05:19:24,520
needs you once again.

5239
05:19:24,520 --> 05:19:26,520
What's happening? Who am I? Where are you?

5240
05:19:26,520 --> 05:19:29,020
Now I am a stone fragment formed

5241
05:19:29,020 --> 05:19:31,020
in the lands of Gaia.

5242
05:19:31,020 --> 05:19:33,020
A Gaia stone, if you will.

5243
05:19:33,020 --> 05:19:35,319
You will understand all

5244
05:19:35,319 --> 05:19:38,580
soon enough. What's up, Rio?

5245
05:19:38,580 --> 05:19:41,590
What a beautiful stone. Yes.

5246
05:19:41,590 --> 05:19:44,200
I'm gonna take it with me.

5247
05:19:44,200 --> 05:19:53,349
Eek. What the fuck was that?

5248
05:19:53,349 --> 05:19:56,040
Rio, what happened?

5249
05:19:56,040 --> 05:19:58,659
I'm okay, sorry.

5250
05:19:58,659 --> 05:20:01,220
Rio, let's go home. Yeah.

5251
05:20:01,220 --> 05:20:05,319
Let's go home.

5252
05:20:05,319 --> 05:20:07,319
That was really fucked up.

5253
05:20:07,319 --> 05:20:15,580
She's having a mental breakdown.

5254
05:20:15,580 --> 05:20:18,069
She touched the magic stone

5255
05:20:18,069 --> 05:20:20,069
and she started hearing voices.

5256
05:20:20,069 --> 05:20:22,250
It started to implant itself in her brain.

5257
05:20:22,250 --> 05:20:29,349
Hey, fain, fain.

5258
05:20:29,349 --> 05:20:31,349
I thought that actually was music, but it's not. I forgot.

5259
05:20:31,349 --> 05:20:34,490
Pollock, you look awfully excited.

5260
05:20:34,490 --> 05:20:36,659
What's going on? Are your

5261
05:20:36,659 --> 05:20:38,900
training gadgets working alright?

5262
05:20:38,900 --> 05:20:40,900
What? Why wouldn't they be?

5263
05:20:40,900 --> 05:20:43,209
There's a Geonite shortage in

5264
05:20:43,209 --> 05:20:45,209
these parts. Gadgets stopped working on

5265
05:20:45,209 --> 05:20:48,599
all the ranches. We seem

5266
05:20:48,599 --> 05:20:51,479
to be doing fine. Well, thank

5267
05:20:51,479 --> 05:20:53,779
goodness. But most of the

5268
05:20:53,779 --> 05:20:55,779
ranches can't train their monsters.

5269
05:20:55,779 --> 05:20:57,779
Official competition may be cancelled

5270
05:20:57,779 --> 05:21:01,430
for the time being.

5271
05:21:01,430 --> 05:21:08,599
What? Don't worry, I'm going to

5272
05:21:08,599 --> 05:21:11,099
look into this. Bye then. I can't do

5273
05:21:11,099 --> 05:21:17,430
any more competitions. Now that he

5274
05:21:17,430 --> 05:21:19,430
mentions it, I have noticed my body

5275
05:21:19,430 --> 05:21:21,430
feeling a bit strange lately.

5276
05:21:21,430 --> 05:21:24,060
But I'm no run-of-the-mill spirit

5277
05:21:24,060 --> 05:21:26,490
tree. I'm tough.

5278
05:21:26,490 --> 05:21:28,490
I think you're the only spirit tree,

5279
05:21:28,490 --> 05:21:30,490
to be honest. Will it be okay?

5280
05:21:30,490 --> 05:21:32,490
I wonder if the training gadgets used

5281
05:21:32,490 --> 05:21:35,180
too much Geonite. No,

5282
05:21:35,180 --> 05:21:37,180
it's not exactly that. It's like the

5283
05:21:37,180 --> 05:21:39,180
Geonite is being sucked down through

5284
05:21:39,180 --> 05:21:42,060
my roots. Your roots?

5285
05:21:42,060 --> 05:21:44,419
We can use the cave to

5286
05:21:44,419 --> 05:21:46,419
check underneath here. Let's do a little

5287
05:21:46,419 --> 05:21:48,729
exploration. Sounds good.

5288
05:21:48,729 --> 05:21:51,909
I just did that though. Don't they

5289
05:21:51,909 --> 05:21:59,849
need to rest? Wait, check

5290
05:21:59,849 --> 05:22:05,479
the fan art. What are you talking about? Fridge pissing.

5291
05:22:05,479 --> 05:22:07,479
What are you guys linking here?

5292
05:22:07,479 --> 05:22:16,759
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm trying

5293
05:22:16,759 --> 05:22:19,959
to click it. A comic book?

5294
05:22:19,959 --> 05:22:22,330
Oh, intelligence

5295
05:22:22,330 --> 05:22:24,330
482. With my vast

5296
05:22:24,330 --> 05:22:26,330
intellect, I have analyzed all possible

5297
05:22:26,330 --> 05:22:28,330
futures. You have no chance of victory.

5298
05:22:28,330 --> 05:22:34,970
K.O.

5299
05:22:34,970 --> 05:22:37,270
A whole comic book?

5300
05:22:37,270 --> 05:22:39,270
Holy shit, that was fast.

5301
05:22:39,270 --> 05:22:41,450
You made a whole comic book.

5302
05:22:41,450 --> 05:22:46,569
That's true though. What the hell would you

5303
05:22:46,569 --> 05:22:48,569
buy? That was the weirdest monster.

5304
05:22:48,569 --> 05:22:50,569
See, I feel like the game broke.

5305
05:22:50,569 --> 05:23:04,889
Here, I'll show it. No, that's not

5306
05:23:04,889 --> 05:23:25,369
what I want. There you go. See?

5307
05:23:25,369 --> 05:23:35,990
482.

5308
05:23:35,990 --> 05:23:39,700
I want to try that with a monster.

5309
05:23:39,700 --> 05:23:42,389
You know what? Not today.

5310
05:23:42,389 --> 05:23:47,130
But on the next stream. On the next stream,

5311
05:23:47,130 --> 05:23:49,130
I want to completely design

5312
05:23:49,130 --> 05:23:51,130
a monster around only having

5313
05:23:51,130 --> 05:23:53,619
only speed and only

5314
05:23:53,619 --> 05:23:56,759
accuracy. So you could just

5315
05:23:56,759 --> 05:23:58,759
spam a shitty move

5316
05:23:58,759 --> 05:24:03,430
and hit it every time. Who cares?

5317
05:24:03,430 --> 05:24:08,619
But that was from Drosophilia.

5318
05:24:08,619 --> 05:24:10,619
Thank you, Drosophilia.

5319
05:24:10,619 --> 05:24:22,459
It's a new day on the East Coast.

5320
05:24:22,459 --> 05:24:24,950
Yeah, it is technically a new day.

5321
05:24:24,950 --> 05:24:27,450
Nah, I'm not done streaming now.

5322
05:24:27,450 --> 05:24:29,619
What are you talking about? We're still going.

5323
05:24:29,619 --> 05:24:32,310
I'll go for like another hour or two.

5324
05:24:32,310 --> 05:24:37,939
It's April 1st.

5325
05:24:37,939 --> 05:24:39,939
That means, I'm just kidding. Stream ends in like

5326
05:24:39,939 --> 05:24:47,430
10 minutes. Alright, what we got for a

5327
05:24:47,430 --> 05:24:49,430
second? We need to go into the...

5328
05:24:49,430 --> 05:24:51,610
There's no training allowed, right?

5329
05:24:51,610 --> 05:24:53,610
Everyone's tired. Rest.

5330
05:24:56,979 --> 05:25:05,750
Everybody go to bed. And then after

5331
05:25:05,750 --> 05:25:07,750
this, we're going to go into the

5332
05:25:07,750 --> 05:25:10,950
cave again, because we have scripted

5333
05:25:10,950 --> 05:25:14,919
cave content. And also,

5334
05:25:14,919 --> 05:25:16,919
by the way, for those of you that are

5335
05:25:16,919 --> 05:25:18,919
curious, I'm not streaming tomorrow.

5336
05:25:18,919 --> 05:25:21,799
I came back for one day

5337
05:25:21,799 --> 05:25:24,810
here, because

5338
05:25:24,810 --> 05:25:27,110
this has been

5339
05:25:27,110 --> 05:25:29,110
Kim's birthday weekend.

5340
05:25:29,110 --> 05:25:33,259
And there's some stuff

5341
05:25:33,259 --> 05:25:35,259
that I want to do. We went out

5342
05:25:35,259 --> 05:25:37,259
already, but tomorrow

5343
05:25:37,259 --> 05:25:39,259
I want to

5344
05:25:39,259 --> 05:25:42,330
take her somewhere else. It's not an

5345
05:25:42,330 --> 05:25:44,889
April Fool's joke, that's for real.

5346
05:25:44,889 --> 05:25:46,889
It's not April Fool's, I promise

5347
05:25:46,889 --> 05:25:49,900
you. Don't you guys know why

5348
05:25:49,900 --> 05:25:51,900
April Fool's jokes and joke

5349
05:25:51,900 --> 05:25:53,900
streams don't even happen on April 1st?

5350
05:25:53,900 --> 05:25:55,900
They happen on like April 11th.

5351
05:25:55,900 --> 05:26:05,419
Good luck.

5352
05:26:05,419 --> 05:26:07,419
April Fool's proposal.

5353
05:26:07,419 --> 05:26:11,060
No, this is Kim's birthday

5354
05:26:11,060 --> 05:26:15,029
weekend. And as you know,

5355
05:26:15,029 --> 05:26:17,029
you celebrate the whole

5356
05:26:17,029 --> 05:26:19,029
week when it's somebody's birthday, not just

5357
05:26:19,029 --> 05:26:28,119
a day. Stream the date.

5358
05:26:28,119 --> 05:26:30,740
I don't think so.

5359
05:26:30,740 --> 05:26:32,740
But, uh, I just want

5360
05:26:32,740 --> 05:26:34,919
to make that clear. And then I'll be

5361
05:26:34,919 --> 05:26:37,099
back. We'll go

5362
05:26:37,099 --> 05:26:39,099
April 2nd, April

5363
05:26:39,099 --> 05:26:41,099
3rd, and probably April 4th.

5364
05:26:41,099 --> 05:26:43,590
And then we'll see what we're doing.

5365
05:26:43,590 --> 05:26:52,490
We'll do another three days

5366
05:26:52,490 --> 05:26:55,619
in a row. After

5367
05:26:55,619 --> 05:27:01,430
tomorrow.

5368
05:27:01,430 --> 05:27:07,189
But now, where are we going now?

5369
05:27:07,189 --> 05:27:09,189
Everybody's all rested? Anybody hungry?

5370
05:27:09,189 --> 05:27:13,220
Because we have to go and do the scripted

5371
05:27:13,220 --> 05:27:15,220
thing. You are hungry, you have a potato.

5372
05:27:25,060 --> 05:27:27,060
Can't wait for the quick stream clip of Jerma throwing

5373
05:27:27,060 --> 05:27:29,060
a pine Kim's face for April Fool's.

5374
05:27:29,060 --> 05:27:32,069
No.

5375
05:27:32,069 --> 05:27:38,790
Like a 10 second stream?

5376
05:27:38,790 --> 05:27:40,790
That would be so bad.

5377
05:27:40,790 --> 05:27:42,790
Alright, adventure, let's go.

5378
05:27:42,790 --> 05:27:47,639
The owl is in energy this time.

5379
05:27:47,639 --> 05:28:03,900
So we have to go under the tree.

5380
05:28:03,900 --> 05:28:09,020
Every day is

5381
05:28:09,020 --> 05:28:11,020
my birthday. Every single day.

5382
05:28:11,020 --> 05:28:31,299
The bats are really annoying. Yeah, they

5383
05:28:31,299 --> 05:28:33,299
really are. They kind of just don't do anything.

5384
05:28:33,299 --> 05:28:35,299
Just fly around. Nobody can get in here.

5385
05:28:35,299 --> 05:28:39,529
Rumor cannot help you investigate.

5386
05:28:39,529 --> 05:28:50,659
No, you can't.

5387
05:28:50,659 --> 05:28:52,659
So, floor three? Floor four?

5388
05:28:52,659 --> 05:28:57,020
Everyone expects me to read

5389
05:28:57,020 --> 05:28:59,189
that. But I'm not going to.

5390
05:28:59,189 --> 05:29:01,189
Because I'm going to try to break

5391
05:29:01,189 --> 05:29:03,189
from the habit apparently if I look over and read

5392
05:29:03,189 --> 05:29:05,189
the weird gross thing that somebody wrote.

5393
05:29:05,189 --> 05:29:09,930
Not tonight.

5394
05:29:09,930 --> 05:29:13,509
I was about to read it out loud. I'm

5395
05:29:13,509 --> 05:29:15,509
starting to learn. I'm starting to figure out how to be

5396
05:29:15,509 --> 05:29:20,250
a streamer. Alright, let's try this new move.

5397
05:29:20,250 --> 05:29:22,869
Let's get uh,

5398
05:29:22,869 --> 05:29:24,869
let's get Roberto in here. So this is

5399
05:29:24,869 --> 05:29:27,299
swing. What's the chance on it?

5400
05:29:27,299 --> 05:29:29,299
76%.

5401
05:29:29,299 --> 05:29:34,790
That's a pretty great move.

5402
05:29:34,790 --> 05:29:37,930
Is it weird that I want to

5403
05:29:37,930 --> 05:29:42,340
turn this into the main character?

5404
05:29:42,340 --> 05:29:49,189
I feel like stat wise.

5405
05:29:49,189 --> 05:29:51,189
Alright, that's back to back.

5406
05:29:51,189 --> 05:30:03,029
Let's go. Nobody else got any moves,

5407
05:30:03,029 --> 05:30:07,130
right? There's something so timid.

5408
05:30:07,130 --> 05:30:11,020
89 damage.

5409
05:30:11,020 --> 05:30:13,020
Overkill.

5410
05:30:13,020 --> 05:30:18,389
Roberto is the protagonist.

5411
05:30:18,389 --> 05:30:20,389
Rumor is the funny sidekick.

5412
05:30:20,389 --> 05:30:23,459
That's true.

5413
05:30:23,459 --> 05:30:31,779
That's actually a really good point.

5414
05:30:31,779 --> 05:30:36,650
Document seven. Uh, let's actually

5415
05:30:38,650 --> 05:30:40,889
let's get Wally up here and

5416
05:30:40,889 --> 05:30:42,889
level up Wally to level three.

5417
05:30:42,889 --> 05:30:54,090
And Wally is the cute pet.

5418
05:30:54,090 --> 05:30:56,520
Wally is the cute pet that doesn't do anything

5419
05:30:56,520 --> 05:30:58,520
for the whole series, but like

5420
05:30:58,520 --> 05:31:00,520
two times over the course of

5421
05:31:00,520 --> 05:31:02,520
400 episodes will save everybody

5422
05:31:02,520 --> 05:31:12,569
for some reason.

5423
05:31:12,569 --> 05:31:17,750
Come on, I got extra damage on this, right?

5424
05:31:17,750 --> 05:31:22,919
Really? Not bad. Not very good

5425
05:31:22,919 --> 05:31:29,580
either. More damage on my

5426
05:31:29,580 --> 05:31:31,939
ranged attacks.

5427
05:31:31,939 --> 05:31:35,529
Team up.

5428
05:31:35,529 --> 05:31:38,790
I think I need more intelligence

5429
05:31:38,790 --> 05:31:46,279
that's why it's not doing any damage.

5430
05:31:46,279 --> 05:31:48,279
Alright, you have to get the

5431
05:31:48,279 --> 05:31:50,279
last hit, but you're really making this hard.

5432
05:31:50,279 --> 05:32:00,779
The baby, Walnut Baby

5433
05:32:00,779 --> 05:32:04,360
has to get last hit.

5434
05:32:04,360 --> 05:32:06,360
Or Walnut, or Wally might just die.

5435
05:32:06,360 --> 05:32:08,360
Wally's gonna die.

5436
05:32:08,360 --> 05:32:10,659
Alright, pull him out. Sometimes you gotta

5437
05:32:10,659 --> 05:32:22,630
know when to fold.

5438
05:32:22,630 --> 05:32:24,630
The Labo VR comes out on April 12th.

5439
05:32:24,630 --> 05:32:30,069
I can't wait.

5440
05:32:30,069 --> 05:32:38,779
Obtained a Nunchaku.

5441
05:32:38,779 --> 05:32:40,779
I cannot wait to do Labo VR.

5442
05:32:40,779 --> 05:32:43,909
I'm gonna lose

5443
05:32:43,909 --> 05:32:46,150
like 10,000 followers

5444
05:32:46,150 --> 05:32:48,150
and like 1,500 people on sub.

5445
05:32:48,150 --> 05:32:50,150
I have to do it though.

5446
05:32:50,150 --> 05:33:03,959
I have to. Not gonna be able to

5447
05:33:03,959 --> 05:33:05,959
stream it though, we can't see the screen.

5448
05:33:05,959 --> 05:33:11,060
I'll find a way. You guys

5449
05:33:11,060 --> 05:33:13,299
can just do it. I'll put the webcam

5450
05:33:13,299 --> 05:33:15,299
inside of the machine and let you guys do it.

5451
05:33:15,299 --> 05:33:29,959
Kermit's gonna go on a Labo

5452
05:33:29,959 --> 05:33:31,959
Cardboard VR date with

5453
05:33:31,959 --> 05:33:34,580
Kim.

5454
05:33:34,580 --> 05:33:53,830
Alright, level up.

5455
05:33:53,830 --> 05:33:55,830
Burn all your old Labo shit.

5456
05:33:55,830 --> 05:33:59,220
I don't even have it anymore.

5457
05:33:59,220 --> 05:34:01,459
Suiko E.

5458
05:34:01,459 --> 05:34:03,459
Alright, give me a last hit.

5459
05:34:03,459 --> 05:34:07,689
You only have 43 health.

5460
05:34:07,689 --> 05:34:19,580
Do it!

5461
05:34:19,580 --> 05:34:22,580
29%. This is not gonna hit.

5462
05:34:22,580 --> 05:34:28,540
35%.

5463
05:34:28,540 --> 05:34:30,540
I could have burnt it for content.

5464
05:34:30,540 --> 05:34:33,419
No, that's dangerous.

5465
05:34:33,419 --> 05:34:35,419
I may have gotten injured during that.

5466
05:34:35,419 --> 05:34:45,909
What a lame streamer.

5467
05:34:45,909 --> 05:34:47,909
10% chance to hit.

5468
05:34:47,909 --> 05:34:49,909
I may as well just stay back here forever.

5469
05:34:49,909 --> 05:34:53,049
But that would be some content.

5470
05:34:53,049 --> 05:34:58,229
Wally, you're really

5471
05:34:58,229 --> 05:35:12,060
kind of pissing me off here.

5472
05:35:12,060 --> 05:35:14,060
You guys don't wanna see that. That's not like, no.

5473
05:35:14,060 --> 05:35:21,860
I don't think it's time to freezer Wally yet.

5474
05:35:21,860 --> 05:35:35,939
Not yet.

5475
05:35:35,939 --> 05:35:38,119
He was so irritated. He was just like,

5476
05:35:38,119 --> 05:35:42,340
Jesus Christ, I'll take care of this.

5477
05:35:42,340 --> 05:35:47,020
Alright, fine. Level three.

5478
05:35:47,020 --> 05:35:49,189
Wally obtained King's Fist

5479
05:35:49,189 --> 05:35:51,430
and mastered Magic Hand

5480
05:35:51,430 --> 05:35:54,250
and obtained Reference.

5481
05:35:54,250 --> 05:36:01,860
Magic Hand.

5482
05:36:01,860 --> 05:36:04,229
Short range.

5483
05:36:04,229 --> 05:36:06,229
Finally a move that has

5484
05:36:06,229 --> 05:36:08,229
accuracy.

5485
05:36:08,229 --> 05:36:11,049
And it's short range. This is perfect.

5486
05:36:11,049 --> 05:36:13,049
Okay. I gotta start building intelligence.

5487
05:36:13,049 --> 05:36:15,049
What does Wally even have for

5488
05:36:15,049 --> 05:36:21,189
stats?

5489
05:36:21,189 --> 05:36:23,189
That's actually not that bad.

5490
05:36:23,189 --> 05:36:25,560
Pretty good, actually.

5491
05:36:25,560 --> 05:36:29,590
Alright, what else did you just learn?

5492
05:36:29,590 --> 05:36:31,830
King's Fist

5493
05:36:31,830 --> 05:36:33,830
versus power moves that use the fists.

5494
05:36:33,830 --> 05:36:41,700
Alright, Wally.

5495
05:36:41,700 --> 05:36:43,700
What smell do you think of when you picture the color

5496
05:36:43,700 --> 05:36:46,139
aquamarine?

5497
05:36:46,139 --> 05:36:48,139
A blue popsicle.

5498
05:36:48,139 --> 05:36:52,659
You know what I'm talking about.

5499
05:36:52,659 --> 05:37:01,880
Got an amethyst.

5500
05:37:01,880 --> 05:37:08,409
Cool. The smell of a blue popsicle.

5501
05:37:08,409 --> 05:37:20,250
I'm sorry, guys.

5502
05:37:20,250 --> 05:37:23,450
You have to do it.

5503
05:37:23,450 --> 05:37:25,450
The electric blue raspberry popsicle.

5504
05:37:25,450 --> 05:37:27,450
Smell it.

5505
05:37:27,450 --> 05:37:33,400
Oh, man. I can't get him with the comedy

5506
05:37:33,400 --> 05:37:36,599
move.

5507
05:37:36,599 --> 05:37:39,349
It's a double hit.

5508
05:37:39,349 --> 05:37:52,979
What's that? 60%?

5509
05:37:52,979 --> 05:37:56,700
Artificial blueberry. Yes.

5510
05:37:56,700 --> 05:37:58,700
Alright, let's get the guy that actually can hurt things

5511
05:37:58,700 --> 05:38:05,799
out here, please.

5512
05:38:05,799 --> 05:38:08,169
That's not good. Really?

5513
05:38:08,169 --> 05:38:14,310
82.

5514
05:38:14,310 --> 05:38:24,549
I'm taking this guy to the top.

5515
05:38:24,549 --> 05:38:26,549
Can I get Roberto level four before this is all done?

5516
05:38:26,549 --> 05:38:31,290
Can you throw Wally off a rooftop?

5517
05:38:31,290 --> 05:38:33,290
Even if I did, it wouldn't be a problem.

5518
05:38:33,290 --> 05:38:35,290
He would just close into his walnut shell.

5519
05:38:35,290 --> 05:38:37,290
And it would be fine.

5520
05:38:37,290 --> 05:38:44,259
Wally's gonna be a slow brain.

5521
05:38:44,259 --> 05:38:50,470
Why did you have to just write that?

5522
05:38:50,470 --> 05:38:52,470
I just made some salsa. Do you want some?

5523
05:38:52,470 --> 05:38:54,650
Why did you write that? Now I want some.

5524
05:38:54,650 --> 05:38:56,650
I actually do want that now.

5525
05:38:56,650 --> 05:39:10,459
87.

5526
05:39:10,459 --> 05:39:12,819
Aww. Ended with another one.

5527
05:39:12,819 --> 05:39:15,580
Actually, now I can bring out...

5528
05:39:15,580 --> 05:39:17,939
No, I'll just...

5529
05:39:17,939 --> 05:39:29,909
What kind of salsa, though?

5530
05:39:29,909 --> 05:39:31,909
This is a lot of different kinds.

5531
05:39:31,909 --> 05:39:33,909
Are we talking like a peach salsa?

5532
05:39:33,909 --> 05:39:35,909
A mango salsa? Raspberry salsa?

5533
05:39:35,909 --> 05:39:37,909
Black bean salsa?

5534
05:39:37,909 --> 05:39:39,909
Maybe a little bit of queso on the side?

5535
05:39:39,909 --> 05:39:41,909
I want this so bad.

5536
05:39:41,909 --> 05:39:43,909
I'll see you later. I'm leaving.

5537
05:39:43,909 --> 05:39:53,000
I'll see you guys in like a month.

5538
05:39:53,000 --> 05:39:55,000
What if I stopped streaming for a month?

5539
05:39:55,000 --> 05:40:06,709
You already did that.

5540
05:40:06,709 --> 05:40:09,209
Yeah, I know. Like before.

5541
05:40:09,209 --> 05:40:11,380
Yeah, just...

5542
05:40:11,380 --> 05:40:13,380
No, not just to eat salsa. This is kind of just...

5543
05:40:13,380 --> 05:40:17,799
We're just hanging out.

5544
05:40:17,799 --> 05:40:19,799
I'll see you guys in a month.

5545
05:40:19,799 --> 05:40:21,799
I'm gonna eat salsa.

5546
05:40:21,799 --> 05:40:33,189
I'm gonna be a salsa review channel on YouTube.

5547
05:40:33,189 --> 05:40:35,189
Well, to be fair, the reason why I stopped streaming for a month

5548
05:40:35,189 --> 05:40:37,189
is because I was traveling

5549
05:40:37,189 --> 05:40:39,500
across the whole country

5550
05:40:39,500 --> 05:40:43,130
in an inflated air car.

5551
05:40:43,130 --> 05:40:45,130
Alright, let's go, Roberto.

5552
05:40:45,130 --> 05:40:50,889
Mastered cut in two.

5553
05:40:50,889 --> 05:40:52,889
Yeah, I think Roberto's gonna be the one that takes us to the top here.

5554
05:40:57,500 --> 05:40:59,500
Short swing mid-range.

5555
05:40:59,500 --> 05:41:01,669
Cut in two.

5556
05:41:01,669 --> 05:41:04,360
Holy shit, look at that damage.

5557
05:41:04,360 --> 05:41:06,360
An A for damage.

5558
05:41:06,360 --> 05:41:09,369
Terrible accuracy.

5559
05:41:09,369 --> 05:41:12,889
But that's pretty amazing.

5560
05:41:12,889 --> 05:41:15,959
I wonder how much damage that actually does.

5561
05:41:15,959 --> 05:41:31,819
We'll find out.

5562
05:41:31,819 --> 05:41:34,119
Alright, let's pull it out. Let's see what happens.

5563
05:41:34,119 --> 05:41:36,119
Alright, cut in two.

5564
05:41:36,119 --> 05:41:39,959
The regular slash does like 90 damage.

5565
05:41:39,959 --> 05:41:41,959
I wonder how much this does.

5566
05:41:41,959 --> 05:41:48,470
Oh, he's gone.

5567
05:41:48,470 --> 05:41:51,290
He's right up on me, huh?

5568
05:41:51,290 --> 05:41:53,659
Alright, fine, I guess. Alright.

5569
05:41:53,659 --> 05:41:55,659
Alright, alright. It's time.

5570
05:41:55,659 --> 05:41:58,860
Let me just kill this motherfucker.

5571
05:41:58,860 --> 05:42:00,860
Bounce it back.

5572
05:42:00,860 --> 05:42:09,880
Cut in two.

5573
05:42:09,880 --> 05:42:14,869
Less damage than the other one.

5574
05:42:14,869 --> 05:42:16,869
Thoughts on recent politics? Yeah, sure, fuck.

5575
05:42:16,869 --> 05:42:20,200
Fuck.

5576
05:42:20,200 --> 05:42:36,069
This and that and that.

5577
05:42:36,069 --> 05:42:44,330
I think I have to make it to the fourth floor here.

5578
05:42:44,330 --> 05:42:46,330
Floor three, this is where we found the little tablet.

5579
05:42:46,330 --> 05:42:59,509
What did I have to eat today?

5580
05:42:59,509 --> 05:43:03,290
Two eggs.

5581
05:43:03,290 --> 05:43:08,020
Some orange juice.

5582
05:43:08,020 --> 05:43:10,330
And a bowl of Lucky Charms.

5583
05:43:10,330 --> 05:43:12,700
But I take out all the

5584
05:43:12,700 --> 05:43:14,700
actual cereal parts and I only eat

5585
05:43:14,700 --> 05:43:19,750
the marshmallow. It takes a long time

5586
05:43:19,750 --> 05:43:26,090
when I do it.

5587
05:43:26,090 --> 05:43:28,090
I just put them back in the box.

5588
05:43:28,090 --> 05:43:30,090
So it's like as if when I'm pouring it,

5589
05:43:30,090 --> 05:43:38,540
it's like its own cereal.

5590
05:43:38,540 --> 05:43:47,750
Troron.

5591
05:43:47,750 --> 05:43:49,750
You might as well just eat spoonfuls of sugar.

5592
05:43:49,750 --> 05:43:58,060
You actually...

5593
05:43:58,060 --> 05:44:00,740
Yeah, I'll be right back. I want to show you.

5594
05:44:00,740 --> 05:45:37,000
It's actually really hard to do this.

5595
05:45:37,000 --> 05:45:42,419
So,

5596
05:45:42,419 --> 05:45:47,400
Lucky Charms.

5597
05:45:47,400 --> 05:46:00,520
It's hard to put a lot of milk on these though.

5598
05:46:00,520 --> 05:46:04,979
No, it's good. Social eating.

5599
05:46:04,979 --> 05:46:13,500
I love Lucky Charms.

5600
05:46:13,500 --> 05:46:25,909
You guys thought I was making that up. I do this.

5601
05:46:25,909 --> 05:46:35,319
I've been doing it since I was like 11.

5602
05:46:35,319 --> 05:46:37,319
You have to put the milk at the bottom.

5603
05:46:37,319 --> 05:46:42,630
Because too much milk.

5604
05:46:42,630 --> 05:46:44,630
Too much milk will cause...

5605
05:46:44,630 --> 05:46:46,630
The sogginess of these marshmallows really gets bad

5606
05:46:46,630 --> 05:46:52,009
after about 30 seconds.

5607
05:46:52,009 --> 05:46:54,009
Why is everybody making fun of me?

5608
05:46:54,009 --> 05:47:00,220
You have weird shit that you do.

5609
05:47:00,220 --> 05:47:17,430
What weird shit do you do?

5610
05:47:17,430 --> 05:47:24,919
What fucked up shit do you do?

5611
05:47:24,919 --> 05:47:26,919
Tell me I don't fucking do that. Somebody called me a liar.

5612
05:47:26,919 --> 05:47:37,860
I put ketchup on my sandwiches.

5613
05:47:37,860 --> 05:47:48,490
That's fucking weird.

5614
05:47:48,490 --> 05:47:51,110
How long does it take to do?

5615
05:47:51,110 --> 05:47:54,310
Well, I buy like 15 boxes.

5616
05:47:54,310 --> 05:47:56,619
Because it really...

5617
05:47:56,619 --> 05:47:58,619
10 to 15 boxes makes one box of marshmallows.

5618
05:47:58,619 --> 05:48:24,409
And I throw the rest in the trash.

5619
05:48:24,409 --> 05:48:27,540
I don't know why this is so weird.

5620
05:48:27,540 --> 05:48:32,659
April Fool's...

5621
05:48:32,659 --> 05:48:34,659
It's 9.50pm

5622
05:48:34,659 --> 05:48:37,099
March 31st.

5623
05:48:37,099 --> 05:48:45,340
April Fool's. What are you talking about?

5624
05:48:45,340 --> 05:48:53,270
This is where your money goes, chat.

5625
05:48:53,270 --> 05:48:55,270
Rumor mastered bang drum.

5626
05:48:55,270 --> 05:49:03,340
It's not an April Fool's joke.

5627
05:49:03,340 --> 05:49:12,040
I just have this.

5628
05:49:12,040 --> 05:49:24,259
One sub is one box.

5629
05:49:24,259 --> 05:49:26,259
Somebody's really concerned.

5630
05:49:26,259 --> 05:49:28,259
Why would you waste money on brand name cereal and throw it away?

5631
05:49:28,259 --> 05:49:41,830
That's not...

5632
05:49:41,830 --> 05:49:45,029
It's alright.

5633
05:49:45,029 --> 05:49:56,729
What a monster.

5634
05:49:56,729 --> 05:49:58,729
How long does it take you to filter a whole box out?

5635
05:49:58,729 --> 05:50:12,020
A long time.

5636
05:50:12,020 --> 05:50:14,020
This is like burning my mouth.

5637
05:50:14,020 --> 05:50:16,900
Alright.

5638
05:50:16,900 --> 05:50:18,900
We got...

5639
05:50:18,900 --> 05:50:22,299
What happened?

5640
05:50:22,299 --> 05:50:27,099
It was Wally, right?

5641
05:50:27,099 --> 05:50:36,439
Rumor?

5642
05:50:36,439 --> 05:50:38,439
Yeah, okay.

5643
05:50:38,439 --> 05:50:41,580
Bang drum.

5644
05:50:41,580 --> 05:50:43,580
Life damage E. Accuracy rate D.

5645
05:50:43,580 --> 05:50:54,569
So addled.

5646
05:50:54,569 --> 05:50:56,569
Does your dentist know you do this?

5647
05:50:56,569 --> 05:50:59,900
He actually encourages it.

5648
05:50:59,900 --> 05:51:01,900
In his way, he said,

5649
05:51:01,900 --> 05:51:03,900
If you just eat sugary cereals every day,

5650
05:51:03,900 --> 05:51:05,900
you'll be more inclined to want to brush your teeth.

5651
05:51:05,900 --> 05:51:08,970
You're supposed to brush your teeth twice a day.

5652
05:51:08,970 --> 05:51:10,970
If you eat lucky charms only,

5653
05:51:10,970 --> 05:51:12,970
the marshmallow parts, he said,

5654
05:51:12,970 --> 05:51:16,040
for at least breakfast and dinner,

5655
05:51:16,040 --> 05:51:18,040
you'll have to brush your teeth.

5656
05:51:18,040 --> 05:51:20,540
Because last time I went to the dentist,

5657
05:51:20,540 --> 05:51:22,840
I hadn't brushed my teeth in about two years.

5658
05:51:22,840 --> 05:51:24,840
And these are all fake.

5659
05:51:24,840 --> 05:51:53,639
All these teeth are fake.

5660
05:51:53,639 --> 05:51:56,389
I hate this bit.

5661
05:51:56,389 --> 05:51:58,389
Do you though?

5662
05:51:58,389 --> 05:52:06,439
Are you sure?

5663
05:52:06,439 --> 05:52:15,139
Water. Can I go in there?

5664
05:52:15,139 --> 05:52:17,139
You're a bad influence on your child viewers.

5665
05:52:17,139 --> 05:52:19,139
Please take responsibility and brush your teeth on stream.

5666
05:52:19,139 --> 05:52:31,369
No, that's gross.

5667
05:52:31,369 --> 05:52:34,310
That's weird.

5668
05:52:34,310 --> 05:52:37,189
Child viewers.

5669
05:52:37,189 --> 05:52:41,189
How old do you think people are watching this channel?

5670
05:52:41,189 --> 05:52:43,189
How old do you think they are?

5671
05:52:43,189 --> 05:52:57,779
Four?

5672
05:52:57,779 --> 05:53:05,590
Speaking of four, we're going to the fourth floor.

5673
05:53:05,590 --> 05:53:08,340
By the way, have you ever had astronaut ice cream?

5674
05:53:08,340 --> 05:53:10,580
It is just

5675
05:53:10,580 --> 05:53:12,580
Lucky Charms marshmallows.

5676
05:53:12,580 --> 05:53:15,459
Gigantic ones.

5677
05:53:15,459 --> 05:53:17,459
Space ice cream?

5678
05:53:17,459 --> 05:53:19,459
If you're one of those people that loves to eat

5679
05:53:19,459 --> 05:53:21,459
freeze-dried marshmallow, like I do,

5680
05:53:21,459 --> 05:53:28,310
I've got a whole bowl of it over here.

5681
05:53:28,310 --> 05:53:30,310
Yeah, and it's fucking garbage.

5682
05:53:30,310 --> 05:53:40,790
Relax.

5683
05:53:40,790 --> 05:53:44,889
Freeze-dried stuff is way too chalky.

5684
05:53:44,889 --> 05:53:46,889
I mean, if you eat chalk.

5685
05:53:46,889 --> 05:53:50,220
Alright, I'm going to stop

5686
05:53:50,220 --> 05:53:52,220
because people are going to think this is like real.

5687
05:53:54,220 --> 05:54:02,729
I really don't want to end up

5688
05:54:02,729 --> 05:54:04,729
somewhere where people think that like, holy shit, he's like

5689
05:54:04,729 --> 05:54:07,479
fucking insane.

5690
05:54:07,479 --> 05:54:28,200
He's kind of good though.

5691
05:54:28,200 --> 05:54:30,200
This haha dentist and cereal joke.

5692
05:54:32,200 --> 05:54:42,119
Why can't I do anything?

5693
05:54:42,119 --> 05:54:46,220
I just dry heaved

5694
05:54:46,220 --> 05:54:48,220
because I heard him eating it.

5695
05:54:48,220 --> 05:54:50,220
It's not like dog poo.

5696
05:54:50,220 --> 05:54:52,220
It's marshmallow.

5697
05:54:52,220 --> 05:54:54,840
You act like I'm eating

5698
05:54:54,840 --> 05:54:56,840
a bowl of paint.

5699
05:54:56,840 --> 05:54:58,840
Or like somebody else's throw up.

5700
05:54:58,840 --> 05:55:00,840
What? It's freeze-dried

5701
05:55:00,840 --> 05:55:03,459
marshmallow.

5702
05:55:03,459 --> 05:55:05,459
What's wrong with it? What's the problem?

5703
05:55:05,459 --> 05:55:13,270
Like I'm not eating

5704
05:55:13,270 --> 05:55:15,270
blended up cold hot dogs

5705
05:55:15,270 --> 05:55:17,580
with a spoon.

5706
05:55:17,580 --> 05:55:42,580
Swing.

5707
05:55:42,580 --> 05:55:45,849
I would pay you to do that.

5708
05:55:45,849 --> 05:55:54,040
I'm not going to do that.

5709
05:55:54,040 --> 05:56:05,099
I would never do something like that.

5710
05:56:05,099 --> 05:56:07,099
Disgusting. Cereal, cereal

5711
05:56:07,099 --> 05:56:09,099
filter.

5712
05:56:09,099 --> 05:56:12,740
No, you want to actually, the best cereal I've ever had was

5713
05:56:12,740 --> 05:56:17,479
original cookie crisp.

5714
05:56:19,479 --> 05:56:26,139
I'm not talking about cookie crisp now.

5715
05:56:26,139 --> 05:56:31,130
Back when it was made with animal fat.

5716
05:56:31,130 --> 05:56:33,130
Whatever the hell it was.

5717
05:56:33,130 --> 05:56:35,130
It was great.

5718
05:56:35,130 --> 05:56:46,389
Stop it. Let me do something.

5719
05:56:46,389 --> 05:56:49,459
I can't even do anything.

5720
05:56:49,459 --> 05:56:51,459
He's just doing E over and over again.

5721
05:56:51,459 --> 05:56:57,479
Cookie crisp now is not very good.

5722
05:56:57,479 --> 05:57:06,180
I'm going to block. Alright, bring in the

5723
05:57:06,180 --> 05:57:08,180
real. Bring in the real

5724
05:57:08,180 --> 05:57:10,180
one here, please.

5725
05:57:10,180 --> 05:57:12,180
Is he dead?

5726
05:57:12,180 --> 05:57:21,529
I wasn't even paying attention. Did he get killed?

5727
05:57:21,529 --> 05:57:23,529
Can I please do something?

5728
05:57:23,529 --> 05:57:25,529
Oh my god.

5729
05:57:25,529 --> 05:57:29,430
If I die to this

5730
05:57:29,430 --> 05:57:31,430
I'm going to be so

5731
05:57:31,430 --> 05:57:36,979
angry.

5732
05:57:44,650 --> 05:57:47,020
Oh my god.

5733
05:57:47,020 --> 05:57:49,020
Finally. Alright, the big money came then.

5734
05:57:49,020 --> 05:57:52,540
Thank you Kairosobi for the

5735
05:57:52,540 --> 05:57:54,540
50 bucks.

5736
05:57:54,540 --> 05:57:56,540
5,000 bits. This is for the

5737
05:57:56,540 --> 05:57:58,540
Marshmallow Fund you 4-2 Leprechaun.

5738
05:57:58,540 --> 05:58:23,860
Boomerang.

5739
05:58:23,860 --> 05:58:26,299
I don't even want these.

5740
05:58:26,299 --> 05:58:32,380
I'm going to put them back in the box.

5741
05:58:32,380 --> 05:58:45,750
I don't want any more of this comedy cereal.

5742
05:58:45,750 --> 05:58:47,750
You're watching Boomerang.

5743
05:58:47,750 --> 05:59:00,169
It's all coming back to you.

5744
05:59:00,169 --> 05:59:03,500
What would your own cereal be? Something

5745
05:59:03,500 --> 05:59:05,500
light. You know Pops?

5746
05:59:05,500 --> 05:59:11,049
It would be something like Pops.

5747
05:59:11,049 --> 05:59:13,049
But with a lighter coating.

5748
05:59:13,049 --> 05:59:20,069
It's not as sugary.

5749
05:59:20,069 --> 05:59:22,069
Leave because of Roberto?

5750
05:59:22,069 --> 05:59:24,069
I'm not going to get the

5751
05:59:24,069 --> 05:59:26,700
cuts in here.

5752
05:59:26,700 --> 05:59:34,360
I have a fucking

5753
05:59:34,360 --> 05:59:49,529
stomach ache now.

5754
05:59:49,529 --> 05:59:51,529
Whose fault is that?

5755
05:59:51,529 --> 05:59:55,110
Jax mix.

5756
05:59:55,110 --> 05:59:58,119
There's like bacteria in these.

5757
05:59:58,119 --> 06:00:00,549
Somebody look it up.

5758
06:00:00,549 --> 06:00:02,549
Is that

5759
06:00:02,549 --> 06:00:05,819
bacteria in

5760
06:00:05,819 --> 06:00:24,889
freeze-dried marshmallows?

5761
06:00:24,889 --> 06:00:26,889
Bacteria in everything.

5762
06:00:26,889 --> 06:00:39,139
That's true.

5763
06:00:39,139 --> 06:00:41,319
You guys know that

5764
06:00:41,319 --> 06:00:43,319
according to doctors

5765
06:00:43,319 --> 06:00:45,939
humans should

5766
06:00:45,939 --> 06:00:47,939
not be taking in more than 32

5767
06:00:47,939 --> 06:00:49,939
grams of sugar or 36

5768
06:00:49,939 --> 06:00:51,939
grams of sugar a day

5769
06:00:51,939 --> 06:00:54,819
of added sugars.

5770
06:00:54,819 --> 06:00:56,819
That is like a whole day.

5771
06:00:56,819 --> 06:00:58,819
Do not consume more than

5772
06:00:58,819 --> 06:01:00,819
38 grams

5773
06:01:00,819 --> 06:01:03,000
of added sugar a day.

5774
06:01:03,000 --> 06:01:05,500
You know how much sugar is in a can of

5775
06:01:05,500 --> 06:01:10,919
Coke?

5776
06:01:10,919 --> 06:01:19,500
39 grams. You know how much is in Mountain Dew?

5777
06:01:19,500 --> 06:01:21,500
Throwback?

5778
06:01:21,500 --> 06:01:30,580
44.

5779
06:01:30,580 --> 06:01:32,580
I've said the same shit before. Yeah.

5780
06:01:32,580 --> 06:01:35,270
Well there's probably a bunch of new people here.

5781
06:01:35,270 --> 06:01:37,270
It's 42 grams of sugar buddy.

5782
06:01:37,270 --> 06:01:39,270
Oh I don't think so. Look it up.

5783
06:01:39,270 --> 06:01:41,270
Added sugar a day for a male

5784
06:01:41,270 --> 06:01:43,270
is like 38. For a female I believe

5785
06:01:43,270 --> 06:01:46,090
it's like 30.

5786
06:01:46,090 --> 06:01:53,049
That's what it says. Look it up.

5787
06:01:53,049 --> 06:01:55,049
Why do I know this? Because my dentist told me.

5788
06:01:55,049 --> 06:02:07,139
Alright.

5789
06:02:07,139 --> 06:02:09,139
I need to figure this out. How much sugar is in one

5790
06:02:09,139 --> 06:02:15,610
Lucky Charm Marshmallow?

5791
06:02:15,610 --> 06:02:17,610
Do we know how many grams of sugar is in one?

5792
06:02:17,610 --> 06:02:30,650
Level 5 for Vroomer.

5793
06:02:30,650 --> 06:02:32,650
What's going on? Nothing? Nothing new at level 5?

5794
06:02:32,650 --> 06:02:39,369
0.25

5795
06:02:39,369 --> 06:02:41,860
grams. I googled it.

5796
06:02:41,860 --> 06:02:48,389
There you go. Put this weight on a scale

5797
06:02:48,389 --> 06:02:58,950
because that's all it is.

5798
06:02:58,950 --> 06:03:01,450
My back hurts now.

5799
06:03:01,450 --> 06:03:03,450
What's with this fucking bacteria marshmallow

5800
06:03:03,450 --> 06:03:13,880
shit that I just ate?

5801
06:03:13,880 --> 06:03:21,750
Alright am I almost there?

5802
06:03:21,750 --> 06:03:30,520
Sugar is reverse salt.

5803
06:03:30,520 --> 06:03:32,520
Does it go underneath the tree?

5804
06:03:32,520 --> 06:03:40,389
How many marshmallows do we eat at a time?

5805
06:03:40,389 --> 06:03:42,389
Oh it's probably like 300 or 400 in here.

5806
06:03:42,389 --> 06:03:55,959
I can't believe you guys fell for the oldest April Fools joke

5807
06:03:55,959 --> 06:03:58,779
in the book. Guy eats

5808
06:03:58,779 --> 06:04:00,779
a bowl of marshmallows.

5809
06:04:11,259 --> 06:04:13,259
Somebody says we didn't.

5810
06:04:13,259 --> 06:04:21,130
Oh yeah the classic April

5811
06:04:21,130 --> 06:04:23,130
Fools joke. This thing looks

5812
06:04:23,130 --> 06:04:35,979
pretty dangerous.

5813
06:04:35,979 --> 06:04:45,189
Joke's on us. He just painted

5814
06:04:45,189 --> 06:04:47,189
wood chips to look like marshmallows.

5815
06:04:47,189 --> 06:04:49,189
Yeah. This is like

5816
06:04:49,189 --> 06:04:51,189
clay. You guys didn't even know.

5817
06:04:51,189 --> 06:05:00,459
Alright get me to the tree

5818
06:05:00,459 --> 06:05:03,400
before they all die.

5819
06:05:03,400 --> 06:05:05,639
Oh my god. What the hell?

5820
06:05:05,639 --> 06:05:10,500
Play-Doh unironically

5821
06:05:10,500 --> 06:05:13,450
tastes good. Well you should

5822
06:05:13,450 --> 06:05:15,450
unironically probably stop doing that.

5823
06:05:15,450 --> 06:05:18,259
That's really not good for you.

5824
06:05:25,939 --> 06:05:35,220
Play-Doh is vegan.

5825
06:05:35,220 --> 06:05:41,029
Yeah and

5826
06:05:41,029 --> 06:05:43,029
so is the plastic

5827
06:05:43,029 --> 06:05:45,029
on my keyboard but I'm not going to pop off

5828
06:05:45,029 --> 06:05:48,680
buttons and swallow them.

5829
06:05:48,680 --> 06:05:58,409
You know how much sugar is in Play-Doh?

5830
06:05:58,409 --> 06:06:10,700
Way too much.

5831
06:06:10,700 --> 06:06:12,700
Buy a keyboard made out of chocolate and eat it on the end of the screen.

5832
06:06:12,700 --> 06:06:15,959
That is actually kind of funny.

5833
06:06:15,959 --> 06:06:22,729
Whoa. This is a weird

5834
06:06:22,729 --> 06:06:35,590
looking monster. Let's shoot him.

5835
06:06:35,590 --> 06:06:37,900
Oh no. Let's just run into him.

5836
06:06:37,900 --> 06:06:45,830
But Play-Doh isn't gluten free.

5837
06:06:45,830 --> 06:06:50,119
Guys you're not supposed to be

5838
06:06:50,119 --> 06:06:52,119
eating Play-Doh. Who cares

5839
06:06:52,119 --> 06:06:54,119
what the nutritional content is.

5840
06:06:54,119 --> 06:07:02,569
It doesn't matter if Play-Doh is gluten free

5841
06:07:02,569 --> 06:07:04,569
or sugar free or

5842
06:07:04,569 --> 06:07:15,319
low sodium. Don't tell

5843
06:07:15,319 --> 06:07:19,860
me what to do. Yeah fine.

5844
06:07:19,860 --> 06:07:25,560
Don't tell me what to do. If I want to

5845
06:07:25,560 --> 06:07:27,560
eat my comedy cereal I'm going to eat it.

5846
06:07:27,560 --> 06:07:33,770
You're not our dad. You're not my dad.

5847
06:07:33,770 --> 06:07:51,799
Alright I got it. What

5848
06:07:51,799 --> 06:07:56,279
the hell?

5849
06:07:56,279 --> 06:08:00,119
Did I just stumble upon a boss?

5850
06:08:00,119 --> 06:08:04,779
Rawr. Whoa is he angry?

5851
06:08:04,779 --> 06:08:07,209
No no he's talking to us.

5852
06:08:07,209 --> 06:08:09,209
Please Fane leave this

5853
06:08:09,209 --> 06:08:11,380
to me. Are you the one using

5854
06:08:11,380 --> 06:08:13,380
the Geonite around here?

5855
06:08:13,380 --> 06:08:15,619
I've lived off Geonite for ages

5856
06:08:15,619 --> 06:08:17,619
rawr. But why

5857
06:08:17,619 --> 06:08:19,619
have you suddenly started using so much

5858
06:08:19,619 --> 06:08:21,990
Geonite?

5859
06:08:21,990 --> 06:08:23,990
The increased flow of Geonite woke

5860
06:08:23,990 --> 06:08:25,990
me up. Now I need lots of Geonite to stay

5861
06:08:25,990 --> 06:08:28,680
awake. But you're causing people

5862
06:08:28,680 --> 06:08:30,680
a lot of trouble. Please sleep once again. Go back to

5863
06:08:30,680 --> 06:08:32,680
bed. Rawr.

5864
06:08:32,680 --> 06:08:35,240
Never. Watch out.

5865
06:08:35,240 --> 06:08:39,909
Get back. Too much G

5866
06:08:39,909 --> 06:08:48,549
fuel. Um.

5867
06:08:48,549 --> 06:08:55,700
Okay.

5868
06:08:55,700 --> 06:09:00,119
That was a good hit.

5869
06:09:00,119 --> 06:09:03,900
King Shiden.

5870
06:09:03,900 --> 06:09:11,430
Shit.

5871
06:09:11,430 --> 06:09:17,259
Back it up. Do it again.

5872
06:09:17,259 --> 06:09:19,259
37%. Get it.

5873
06:09:19,259 --> 06:09:37,419
Good block. Come on.

5874
06:09:37,419 --> 06:09:39,419
You have 96 guts. Make this work.

5875
06:09:39,419 --> 06:09:42,939
Holy moly. Guts down.

5876
06:09:42,939 --> 06:09:49,020
Slow. Get killed.

5877
06:09:49,020 --> 06:09:51,509
137 damage.

5878
06:09:51,509 --> 06:09:54,580
Alright it's all up to you. You still

5879
06:09:54,580 --> 06:10:01,689
can't hit it. What? You alright?

5880
06:10:01,689 --> 06:10:07,049
Charge.

5881
06:10:07,049 --> 06:10:10,439
Get in there.

5882
06:10:10,439 --> 06:10:13,770
Alright. One more of those. That's it.

5883
06:10:13,770 --> 06:10:15,770
Come on Vroomer. 44% chance. Get it.

5884
06:10:15,770 --> 06:10:23,130
Yes. I win.

5885
06:10:23,130 --> 06:10:25,130
Only Vroomer gets the EXP unfortunately.

5886
06:10:25,130 --> 06:10:27,750
High speed ride.

5887
06:10:27,750 --> 06:10:29,750
And mastered 0

5888
06:10:29,750 --> 06:10:32,500
to 60. Nice.

5889
06:10:32,500 --> 06:10:38,520
You just killed an old

5890
06:10:38,520 --> 06:10:46,069
god. Alright.

5891
06:10:46,069 --> 06:10:50,040
I'm so sorry.

5892
06:10:50,040 --> 06:10:52,040
But please understand we need Geonite.

5893
06:10:52,040 --> 06:10:54,040
Therefore you have to die.

5894
06:10:54,040 --> 06:10:57,049
Humans use some Geonite.

5895
06:10:57,049 --> 06:10:59,479
Times have changed.

5896
06:10:59,479 --> 06:11:01,479
Young princess, it's been a long time.

5897
06:11:01,479 --> 06:11:04,099
I'll be good for your sake.

5898
06:11:04,099 --> 06:11:06,729
What? How do you know about me?

5899
06:11:06,729 --> 06:11:08,729
I guess we Raiden are your

5900
06:11:08,729 --> 06:11:11,290
friends. What do you mean?

5901
06:11:13,779 --> 06:11:16,090
Tell me.

5902
06:11:16,090 --> 06:11:18,090
Shoot he's asleep.

5903
06:11:18,090 --> 06:11:20,090
But at least now the flow of Geonite will return to normal.

5904
06:11:20,090 --> 06:11:23,099
Look near his feet.

5905
06:11:23,099 --> 06:11:26,619
Hmm. A huge pair of wings.

5906
06:11:26,619 --> 06:11:28,619
Are these his wings?

5907
06:11:28,619 --> 06:11:30,860
He said they are our friends.

5908
06:11:30,860 --> 06:11:32,860
Maybe these wings are to prove that.

5909
06:11:32,860 --> 06:11:37,400
The great Raiden are our

5910
06:11:37,400 --> 06:11:39,400
friends. Awesome. Let's go back to the

5911
06:11:39,400 --> 06:11:51,740
ranch. Who made

5912
06:11:51,740 --> 06:11:54,680
this game?

5913
06:11:54,680 --> 06:11:57,369
Who the fuck did it? Capcom, right?

5914
06:11:57,369 --> 06:12:00,569
Wally was injured. I'll send it to the

5915
06:12:00,569 --> 06:12:06,119
hospital. Uh oh.

5916
06:12:06,119 --> 06:12:08,119
Wally hasn't gotten better yet. I sure

5917
06:12:08,119 --> 06:12:10,119
hope it comes back soon.

5918
06:12:10,119 --> 06:12:17,779
Is anybody home? Yes.

5919
06:12:17,779 --> 06:12:19,779
Oh, Cynthia. Today I've come with a

5920
06:12:19,779 --> 06:12:22,340
delivery. A breeder

5921
06:12:22,340 --> 06:12:24,340
ranking card. We've earned rank

5922
06:12:24,340 --> 06:12:26,580
D. Yep.

5923
06:12:26,580 --> 06:12:28,580
Your efforts have earned an official ranking.

5924
06:12:28,580 --> 06:12:31,209
Congratulations. Thank you very much.

5925
06:12:31,209 --> 06:12:33,209
And also with the Geonite

5926
06:12:33,209 --> 06:12:35,209
shortage finally solved, official

5927
06:12:35,209 --> 06:12:37,209
battles will finally be starting again.

5928
06:12:37,209 --> 06:12:39,580
Well I'll be rooting for you.

5929
06:12:39,580 --> 06:12:41,819
Do your best. Yes, yes we will.

5930
06:12:41,819 --> 06:12:44,180
We'll do our very best.

5931
06:12:44,180 --> 06:12:55,180
Where's Wally?

5932
06:13:00,419 --> 06:13:04,330
Is he dead for real?

5933
06:13:06,330 --> 06:13:12,779
Okay.

5934
06:13:12,779 --> 06:13:14,779
Calendar?

5935
06:13:14,779 --> 06:13:16,779
Alright, rumor needs

5936
06:13:16,779 --> 06:13:18,779
another...

5937
06:13:18,779 --> 06:13:20,779
Unfortunately I had to miss

5938
06:13:20,779 --> 06:13:22,779
these because I can't join this yet.

5939
06:13:22,779 --> 06:13:26,619
And I have to sign up for this one.

5940
06:13:26,619 --> 06:13:28,619
Sign up for this one,

5941
06:13:28,619 --> 06:13:30,619
get ready for it, and then

5942
06:13:32,790 --> 06:13:34,790
also Roberto

5943
06:13:34,790 --> 06:13:36,790
needs to get ready for

5944
06:13:36,790 --> 06:13:38,790
one of these, this one, Banana.

5945
06:13:44,860 --> 06:13:47,099
Just let Wally die.

5946
06:13:47,099 --> 06:13:49,529
Let me take a look at

5947
06:13:49,529 --> 06:13:51,529
their data here. What do we need?

5948
06:13:51,529 --> 06:13:54,090
Roberto needs

5949
06:13:54,090 --> 06:13:56,520
um, accuracy.

5950
06:13:56,520 --> 06:13:58,520
Accuracy and life.

5951
06:13:58,520 --> 06:14:00,520
Rumor needs life

5952
06:14:00,520 --> 06:14:03,459
and either life, probably life

5953
06:14:03,459 --> 06:14:11,130
and defense.

5954
06:14:11,130 --> 06:14:13,130
Let's get you in the tub.

5955
06:14:13,130 --> 06:14:17,779
And then

5956
06:14:17,779 --> 06:14:19,779
get you with the blade in your

5957
06:14:19,779 --> 06:14:21,779
it's okay to click, oh no no no.

5958
06:14:21,779 --> 06:14:24,020
Do defense twice.

5959
06:14:28,020 --> 06:14:32,869
You...

5960
06:14:32,869 --> 06:14:34,869
What did I say for you?

5961
06:14:34,869 --> 06:14:37,619
It was defense, right?

5962
06:14:39,619 --> 06:14:41,619
No, it was life.

5963
06:14:41,619 --> 06:14:43,619
Do life twice.

5964
06:14:47,020 --> 06:14:51,819
Make another monster?

5965
06:14:51,819 --> 06:14:53,990
I could do that, yeah.

5966
06:14:53,990 --> 06:14:55,990
Wally sucks.

5967
06:14:55,990 --> 06:14:59,880
I'm gonna freeze Wally.

5968
06:15:01,880 --> 06:15:18,380
I mean, it's just the truth.

5969
06:15:18,380 --> 06:15:20,380
Here, have some food.

5970
06:15:20,380 --> 06:15:22,380
Have a banana.

5971
06:15:22,380 --> 06:15:27,369
Wally was good when he pierced shields.

5972
06:15:27,369 --> 06:15:29,369
Yeah, that's true.

5973
06:15:29,369 --> 06:15:34,619
But these two are way better.

5974
06:15:34,619 --> 06:15:40,060
Alright, hold on.

5975
06:15:40,060 --> 06:15:42,619
Silver coin.

5976
06:15:42,619 --> 06:15:45,430
I have so much of this stuff.

5977
06:15:45,430 --> 06:15:47,430
You want some cards?

5978
06:15:47,430 --> 06:15:50,500
I think Roberto hates battle cards.

5979
06:15:50,500 --> 06:15:52,500
It says I don't want it.

5980
06:15:52,500 --> 06:15:56,599
Yeah, right.

5981
06:15:56,599 --> 06:15:58,599
That's a nice cover.

5982
06:15:58,599 --> 06:16:05,319
You have every pack.

5983
06:16:05,319 --> 06:16:12,169
Alright, let's get back out here.

5984
06:16:12,169 --> 06:16:14,169
Check out Rumor's new...

5985
06:16:14,169 --> 06:16:16,169
I thought for some reason, I don't know why it said that.

5986
06:16:16,169 --> 06:16:18,169
I thought it said emote.

5987
06:16:18,169 --> 06:16:20,169
Check out Rumor's new emote.

5988
06:16:20,169 --> 06:16:25,799
What condiment would I choose

5989
06:16:25,799 --> 06:16:27,799
if I had to drink a liter of it in one sitting?

5990
06:16:33,110 --> 06:16:37,590
Probably like A1 steak sauce.

5991
06:16:37,590 --> 06:16:40,279
I feel like that wouldn't be that hard.

5992
06:16:50,069 --> 06:16:52,069
Let's go to the shrine.

5993
06:16:52,069 --> 06:16:59,819
Wally never came back.

5994
06:16:59,819 --> 06:17:01,819
Therefore, we're replacing him.

5995
06:17:01,819 --> 06:17:07,580
We can't.

5996
06:17:07,580 --> 06:17:10,900
I can't do anything.

5997
06:17:10,900 --> 06:17:12,900
Wally is in the hospital, but he still counts as a slut.

5998
06:17:12,900 --> 06:17:23,849
Freeze him in the hospital!

5999
06:17:23,849 --> 06:17:27,110
I don't think I can even do that.

6000
06:17:27,110 --> 06:17:35,819
Unplug him.

6001
06:17:35,819 --> 06:17:38,119
You guys are brutal.

6002
06:17:38,119 --> 06:17:40,490
Okay, training.

6003
06:17:40,490 --> 06:17:42,490
What's the schedule look like?

6004
06:17:42,490 --> 06:17:44,490
You have a tournament tomorrow,

6005
06:17:44,490 --> 06:17:46,490
so you're going to do light blade tonight,

6006
06:17:46,490 --> 06:17:48,490
and you're going to rest tomorrow.

6007
06:17:48,490 --> 06:17:50,490
You have a tournament later on in the week,

6008
06:17:50,490 --> 06:17:52,490
so you're going to do tub,

6009
06:17:52,490 --> 06:17:54,490
and then you're going to rest.

6010
06:17:54,490 --> 06:18:06,439
Get in.

6011
06:18:06,439 --> 06:18:08,740
Alright, you have to eat.

6012
06:18:08,740 --> 06:18:11,750
Oh fuck, I'm out of food.

6013
06:18:11,750 --> 06:18:15,720
I am out of food.

6014
06:18:15,720 --> 06:18:18,220
What happened to Wally?

6015
06:18:18,220 --> 06:18:21,029
Probably dead.

6016
06:18:21,029 --> 06:18:24,490
There's a possibility that Wally is dead.

6017
06:18:24,490 --> 06:18:33,959
He's been gone for a long time.

6018
06:18:35,959 --> 06:18:38,709
You don't have to eat right now.

6019
06:18:42,619 --> 06:18:44,619
I'm going to buy some stuff.

6020
06:18:44,619 --> 06:18:51,340
Crush Wally in a hydraulic press.

6021
06:18:53,340 --> 06:18:57,369
I swear,

6022
06:18:57,369 --> 06:18:59,369
some of you guys

6023
06:18:59,369 --> 06:19:01,369
have lost your minds.

6024
06:19:01,369 --> 06:19:03,369
What?

6025
06:19:03,369 --> 06:19:06,569
Why?

6026
06:19:06,569 --> 06:19:09,380
Let's get like five bananas.

6027
06:19:09,380 --> 06:19:11,990
Shitload of potatoes.

6028
06:19:17,110 --> 06:19:19,990
Okay.

6029
06:19:19,990 --> 06:19:24,090
I'm going to save my money.

6030
06:19:24,090 --> 06:19:26,900
Let's sell.

6031
06:19:26,900 --> 06:19:28,900
I have some new items here.

6032
06:19:28,900 --> 06:19:32,169
990 gold.

6033
06:19:32,169 --> 06:19:34,169
Yarn ball, battle cards,

6034
06:19:34,169 --> 06:19:36,169
silver coin, amethyst.

6035
06:19:36,169 --> 06:19:38,169
These are all worth...

6036
06:19:38,169 --> 06:19:49,619
I should just sell all this shit.

6037
06:19:49,619 --> 06:19:51,619
Bring Wally into a condiment and drink a gallon of it.

6038
06:19:56,889 --> 06:19:58,889
I'm going to tell your mother that you said that.

6039
06:20:08,220 --> 06:20:10,220
Slashman21's mom?

6040
06:20:12,520 --> 06:20:14,700
You see what your fucking son just wrote?

6041
06:20:14,700 --> 06:20:21,610
We all live in the same house.

6042
06:20:45,080 --> 06:20:47,080
Sleep.

6043
06:20:47,080 --> 06:20:49,080
Rest.

6044
06:20:49,080 --> 06:20:51,080
And you are also going to rest.

6045
06:20:51,080 --> 06:20:54,860
Look who's back.

6046
06:20:54,860 --> 06:20:58,310
You made it back. Welcome back.

6047
06:20:58,310 --> 06:21:07,209
Ship him off to the glue factory.

6048
06:21:07,209 --> 06:21:15,400
He has a terrible...

6049
06:21:15,400 --> 06:21:20,779
Alright, everyone's fine.

6050
06:21:20,779 --> 06:21:25,270
Let's get Roberto into the competition.

6051
06:21:25,270 --> 06:21:27,509
I want to get him up.

6052
06:21:27,509 --> 06:21:43,509
He's got to rank the fuck up, man.

6053
06:21:43,509 --> 06:21:45,509
And look, on the next stream, the next time we play this,

6054
06:21:45,509 --> 06:21:48,200
this is an audition.

6055
06:21:48,200 --> 06:21:54,860
Because whoever is the best

6056
06:21:54,860 --> 06:21:56,860
pretty much at the end of this stream

6057
06:21:56,860 --> 06:22:12,020
is the one that gets to move on.

6058
06:22:12,020 --> 06:22:20,389
What just happened?

6059
06:22:20,389 --> 06:22:22,389
Why did that... I couldn't... What?

6060
06:22:27,580 --> 06:22:30,650
He gave up.

6061
06:22:30,650 --> 06:22:32,650
He saw the wolf-gundam suit and he quit.

6062
06:22:32,650 --> 06:22:36,099
Why?

6063
06:22:36,099 --> 06:22:43,509
Alright, Decker.

6064
06:22:43,509 --> 06:22:46,650
117 damage. You ain't got shit.

6065
06:22:46,650 --> 06:22:48,650
I feel like this is the guy that would get to S-rank.

6066
06:22:48,650 --> 06:22:51,020
Super easily.

6067
06:22:51,020 --> 06:23:03,560
It was that easy.

6068
06:23:03,560 --> 06:23:09,380
Yeah, I bullied a bunch of rank-ees.

6069
06:23:09,380 --> 06:23:11,380
I did it.

6070
06:23:11,380 --> 06:23:16,439
800 bucks. And a banana.

6071
06:23:16,439 --> 06:23:27,700
You guys are fucking sadistic.

6072
06:23:27,700 --> 06:23:37,180
Somebody just said something fucking horrible.

6073
06:23:37,180 --> 06:23:39,180
Okay, what we got?

6074
06:23:39,180 --> 06:23:41,479
Begin training? Not yet.

6075
06:23:41,479 --> 06:23:43,479
So somebody else has a...

6076
06:23:43,479 --> 06:23:46,619
You have the final...

6077
06:23:46,619 --> 06:23:48,619
Is this right?

6078
06:23:48,619 --> 06:23:50,619
Hold on, let me see.

6079
06:23:50,619 --> 06:23:52,979
What's the calendar look like?

6080
06:23:52,979 --> 06:23:54,979
So you got...

6081
06:23:54,979 --> 06:23:56,979
This is the last...

6082
06:23:56,979 --> 06:23:59,220
No, where is it?

6083
06:23:59,220 --> 06:24:01,529
Okay.

6084
06:24:01,529 --> 06:24:03,529
So you got this one. If you beat this one,

6085
06:24:03,529 --> 06:24:05,529
then I can sign up for this one

6086
06:24:05,529 --> 06:24:07,529
and try to move on

6087
06:24:07,529 --> 06:24:09,529
to C-rank.

6088
06:24:09,529 --> 06:24:13,159
Good. So what do you need?

6089
06:24:13,159 --> 06:24:17,240
Life

6090
06:24:17,240 --> 06:24:22,090
and defense.

6091
06:24:22,090 --> 06:24:24,779
Let's do it.

6092
06:24:24,779 --> 06:24:26,950
Just do life twice.

6093
06:24:26,950 --> 06:24:29,770
Life, life, rest.

6094
06:24:29,770 --> 06:24:31,770
Sounds good.

6095
06:24:31,770 --> 06:24:33,770
You, on the other hand, you're gonna do...

6096
06:24:33,770 --> 06:24:35,939
You need like...

6097
06:24:35,939 --> 06:24:37,939
I don't have anything for intelligence, do I?

6098
06:24:37,939 --> 06:24:39,939
Just get your int up. Do it twice.

6099
06:24:39,939 --> 06:24:42,889
And you're gonna do...

6100
06:24:42,889 --> 06:24:44,889
Yeah, sandbag power is good.

6101
06:24:44,889 --> 06:24:46,889
And...

6102
06:24:46,889 --> 06:24:49,830
I also want...

6103
06:24:49,830 --> 06:24:53,220
Life. Get the tongue.

6104
06:24:53,220 --> 06:25:03,979
Pretty good session for everybody.

6105
06:25:03,979 --> 06:25:13,259
Probably should feed most people here.

6106
06:25:15,259 --> 06:25:27,909
All right.

6107
06:25:27,909 --> 06:25:29,909
Let's give everybody some potato.

6108
06:25:34,970 --> 06:25:36,970
What console is this on PlayStation 2?

6109
06:25:36,970 --> 06:25:44,119
PS2.

6110
06:25:44,119 --> 06:25:46,299
Are you hungry? Yes, you are.

6111
06:25:46,299 --> 06:25:48,299
You kind of had like a rough couple of days, so

6112
06:25:48,299 --> 06:26:01,029
I'll give you a banana. Are we all good to go?

6113
06:26:01,029 --> 06:26:03,979
Yes.

6114
06:26:08,520 --> 06:26:18,299
Oh, your whole schedule

6115
06:26:18,299 --> 06:26:20,299
is gone.

6116
06:26:20,299 --> 06:26:22,659
Okay, so you did meditation.

6117
06:26:22,659 --> 06:26:24,659
That's fine.

6118
06:26:24,659 --> 06:26:26,659
I'll change the schedule after this week.

6119
06:26:26,659 --> 06:26:28,659
So who else we got?

6120
06:26:28,659 --> 06:26:30,659
You're doing fine. You need to rest

6121
06:26:30,659 --> 06:26:32,659
anyways.

6122
06:26:32,659 --> 06:26:34,659
So you did life blade, rest.

6123
06:26:34,659 --> 06:26:36,840
Battle.

6124
06:26:36,840 --> 06:26:38,840
You are gonna do

6125
06:26:38,840 --> 06:26:40,840
hub, rest.

6126
06:26:40,840 --> 06:26:50,299
Yeah, let's go.

6127
06:26:50,299 --> 06:26:52,299
Pretty good increases all the way around,

6128
06:26:52,299 --> 06:26:54,299
except for maybe Roberto.

6129
06:26:54,299 --> 06:26:58,900
Jerma, I'm sorry I said you were

6130
06:26:58,900 --> 06:27:01,080
bad at Sekiro.

6131
06:27:01,080 --> 06:27:03,080
That's all right, as long as you apologized.

6132
06:27:03,080 --> 06:27:05,080
I accept your apology.

6133
06:27:10,900 --> 06:27:15,319
Lively. I just want you to

6134
06:27:15,319 --> 06:27:17,319
let you know that your mother loves you. Thanks, Mom.

6135
06:27:17,319 --> 06:27:23,340
All right, so you got something coming up here.

6136
06:27:23,340 --> 06:27:26,900
You're kind of all blue.

6137
06:27:26,900 --> 06:27:32,340
April Fools.

6138
06:27:32,340 --> 06:27:37,400
No!

6139
06:27:37,400 --> 06:27:41,180
Shit!

6140
06:27:41,180 --> 06:27:43,180
No, I had that queued up already.

6141
06:27:47,770 --> 06:27:49,770
All right.

6142
06:27:49,770 --> 06:27:51,770
Take a banana

6143
06:27:51,770 --> 06:27:54,389
or potato.

6144
06:27:54,389 --> 06:27:56,389
Let's do this last tournament, and then

6145
06:27:56,389 --> 06:28:02,919
bring you to rank C.

6146
06:28:02,919 --> 06:28:06,439
I think you have new stuff.

6147
06:28:06,439 --> 06:28:09,130
All right, so we got

6148
06:28:09,130 --> 06:28:11,819
this is 0 to 60.

6149
06:28:11,819 --> 06:28:13,819
Accuracy rate is B.

6150
06:28:13,819 --> 06:28:16,630
That's pretty decent.

6151
06:28:16,630 --> 06:28:18,630
Pretty decent crit damage, too.

6152
06:28:18,630 --> 06:28:22,790
I already have these on.

6153
06:28:22,790 --> 06:28:24,790
It's drifting.

6154
06:28:24,790 --> 06:28:26,790
All right, so 0 to 60.

6155
06:28:26,790 --> 06:28:28,790
What's the difference between this

6156
06:28:28,790 --> 06:28:30,790
and...

6157
06:28:30,790 --> 06:28:33,659
Let's see.

6158
06:28:33,659 --> 06:28:35,659
Life damage B, life damage C.

6159
06:28:35,659 --> 06:28:37,659
So this is better.

6160
06:28:37,659 --> 06:28:39,659
No, I have worse damage.

6161
06:28:39,659 --> 06:28:41,659
It's way more accurate, though.

6162
06:28:44,150 --> 06:28:46,150
Yeah, I would do this way more.

6163
06:28:46,150 --> 06:28:48,150
Holy shit, look at that.

6164
06:28:48,150 --> 06:28:51,220
It costs 40 guts to do this.

6165
06:28:51,220 --> 06:28:53,220
It's got a really good hit rate, but

6166
06:28:53,220 --> 06:28:58,540
that's a lot.

6167
06:28:58,540 --> 06:29:00,540
What do you do? You got something else to do.

6168
06:29:00,540 --> 06:29:02,900
High speed ride

6169
06:29:02,900 --> 06:29:04,900
lets you ride your monster at high speed

6170
06:29:04,900 --> 06:29:09,900
in order to avoid enemies.

6171
06:29:09,900 --> 06:29:21,139
How does that mean? Okay, anybody hungry?

6172
06:29:21,139 --> 06:29:24,790
All right, tournament time.

6173
06:29:26,790 --> 06:29:31,849
It's a passive or something,

6174
06:29:31,849 --> 06:29:34,540
somehow.

6175
06:29:34,540 --> 06:29:41,380
It's some kind of passive.

6176
06:29:41,380 --> 06:29:43,380
We're presenting the cup.

6177
06:29:43,380 --> 06:29:46,180
Who will rise?

6178
06:29:46,180 --> 06:29:48,180
It's the same dialogue every time.

6179
06:29:48,180 --> 06:29:50,180
All right, Pokey, Poke,

6180
06:29:50,180 --> 06:29:52,180
Jurl, and Cage.

6181
06:29:52,180 --> 06:29:56,139
Cage.

6182
06:29:56,139 --> 06:29:58,139
158 power, 147 defense.

6183
06:29:58,139 --> 06:30:00,139
You're a chump and will kill you

6184
06:30:00,139 --> 06:30:02,139
very easily to a point where

6185
06:30:02,139 --> 06:30:04,630
it is going to be...

6186
06:30:04,630 --> 06:30:09,299
Yeah, see you later.

6187
06:30:09,299 --> 06:30:16,470
I didn't even need to embarrass him.

6188
06:30:16,470 --> 06:30:19,290
Everybody's just afraid of me.

6189
06:30:19,290 --> 06:30:22,549
All right, this is Jurl.

6190
06:30:22,549 --> 06:30:24,549
Pretty good.

6191
06:30:24,549 --> 06:30:26,549
177, 172,

6192
06:30:26,549 --> 06:30:29,299
155, 151.

6193
06:30:29,299 --> 06:30:31,299
Not that strong with melee though.

6194
06:30:31,299 --> 06:30:33,669
All right, so you got a lot of...

6195
06:30:33,669 --> 06:30:35,669
Okay, I gotta be wary of your...

6196
06:30:35,669 --> 06:30:45,849
Why would I...

6197
06:30:45,849 --> 06:30:48,020
Why even...

6198
06:30:48,020 --> 06:30:51,419
Are they just going to give me the trophy for sitting on the bench?

6199
06:30:51,419 --> 06:30:54,490
Pokey, Pokey

6200
06:30:54,490 --> 06:30:59,479
is awful.

6201
06:30:59,479 --> 06:31:03,639
All right, at least Pokey Pokey is going to actually fight me.

6202
06:31:03,639 --> 06:31:05,639
He has the worst stats.

6203
06:31:05,639 --> 06:31:09,479
Pokey Pokey had the worst stats out of all of them.

6204
06:31:09,479 --> 06:31:16,389
The bravest, apparently.

6205
06:31:16,389 --> 06:31:21,130
Nasty!

6206
06:31:21,130 --> 06:31:25,669
All right, well, that was cute.

6207
06:31:25,669 --> 06:31:28,680
Back it up. Fine.

6208
06:31:28,680 --> 06:31:30,680
All right, don't get cocky here.

6209
06:31:30,680 --> 06:31:34,259
Okay, they were going to hand me the trophy and now I gotta be careful.

6210
06:31:34,259 --> 06:31:36,259
Just don't fucking let up.

6211
06:31:36,259 --> 06:31:38,700
Drift into the charge.

6212
06:31:38,700 --> 06:31:44,259
18 damage, that's it.

6213
06:31:44,259 --> 06:31:47,900
Pokey better not win.

6214
06:31:47,900 --> 06:31:49,900
Just do the drum again.

6215
06:31:49,900 --> 06:32:01,290
He's too unsusceptible to it, it's over.

6216
06:32:01,290 --> 06:32:04,419
All right, time to get out of this rank.

6217
06:32:04,419 --> 06:32:12,490
Almost died to Pokey Pokey.

6218
06:32:12,490 --> 06:32:14,490
That's the real question.

6219
06:32:14,490 --> 06:32:16,490
Only three fame, people are getting annoyed

6220
06:32:16,490 --> 06:32:18,490
at how easy this is for him, apparently.

6221
06:32:18,490 --> 06:32:20,790
Are you in a garbage

6222
06:32:20,790 --> 06:32:22,790
elo? Not for long.

6223
06:32:22,790 --> 06:32:31,240
Smurfing and almost losing.

6224
06:32:31,240 --> 06:32:33,240
Yeah, how many times have you guys been smurfing?

6225
06:32:33,240 --> 06:32:35,240
And you have to answer the phone or something

6226
06:32:35,240 --> 06:32:38,119
and you're playing with one hand.

6227
06:32:38,119 --> 06:32:40,119
Okay.

6228
06:32:40,119 --> 06:32:42,119
This is

6229
06:32:42,119 --> 06:32:44,119
who is in this one this week.

6230
06:32:44,119 --> 06:32:46,119
Let's get Roberto in here.

6231
06:32:46,119 --> 06:32:49,830
Because we gotta

6232
06:32:49,830 --> 06:32:53,860
start bringing people up.

6233
06:32:53,860 --> 06:32:57,900
Sandbag.

6234
06:32:57,900 --> 06:32:59,900
No, just, yeah, just do it.

6235
06:32:59,900 --> 06:33:05,529
Fuck it, do it, he's gonna win.

6236
06:33:05,529 --> 06:33:13,529
What are you gonna do this week?

6237
06:33:13,529 --> 06:33:21,189
Target, right, okay.

6238
06:33:21,189 --> 06:33:23,189
When are you gonna fuse, Wally?

6239
06:33:23,189 --> 06:33:28,810
I don't think I'm gonna.

6240
06:33:28,810 --> 06:33:35,139
So now you're ready to go to the

6241
06:33:35,139 --> 06:33:37,580
final tournament.

6242
06:33:37,580 --> 06:33:39,580
Hopefully I win that tournament.

6243
06:33:39,580 --> 06:33:41,580
Usually the official tournament's a no joke.

6244
06:33:41,580 --> 06:33:45,419
All right, you're okay, just eat. I'll give you something good.

6245
06:33:45,419 --> 06:33:47,419
You have a squid.

6246
06:33:52,689 --> 06:34:00,049
Proceed to the weekend activities, yes.

6247
06:34:00,049 --> 06:34:02,799
Let's pull

6248
06:34:02,799 --> 06:34:04,799
you out here.

6249
06:34:04,799 --> 06:34:07,040
Get him to D-rank.

6250
06:34:07,040 --> 06:34:11,520
I heard you're gonna propose to Kim tomorrow

6251
06:34:11,520 --> 06:34:13,520
and then pepper spray her for April Fool's Day.

6252
06:34:13,520 --> 06:34:17,869
Well, I don't know where

6253
06:34:17,869 --> 06:34:19,869
you heard that from. That's a

6254
06:34:19,869 --> 06:34:21,869
very odd thing to hear.

6255
06:34:21,869 --> 06:34:27,060
All right, Donna, a kubilik

6256
06:34:27,060 --> 06:34:29,060
inchara. Let's just, I don't even need to

6257
06:34:29,060 --> 06:34:31,299
see what they do. I'm gonna

6258
06:34:31,299 --> 06:34:40,509
insta-kill this person. Donna's the toothpaste.

6259
06:34:40,509 --> 06:34:44,349
I'm gonna go

6260
06:34:44,349 --> 06:34:46,349
level slash instant kill.

6261
06:34:46,349 --> 06:34:51,220
Well, would've been.

6262
06:34:51,220 --> 06:34:55,250
All right, well, if you would

6263
06:34:55,250 --> 06:34:57,250
not be so timid.

6264
06:34:57,250 --> 06:35:01,279
Good slice. Again.

6265
06:35:01,279 --> 06:35:12,990
These are, it's only

6266
06:35:12,990 --> 06:35:14,990
two matches, so it's easy. I like to do these.

6267
06:35:14,990 --> 06:35:17,360
For these low level ones, I should not

6268
06:35:17,360 --> 06:35:19,360
be doing the ones that have

6269
06:35:19,360 --> 06:35:21,360
four matches or three matches at least.

6270
06:35:21,360 --> 06:35:36,270
Just the ones with two. We already saw

6271
06:35:36,270 --> 06:35:47,540
you before. Didn't even get a chance.

6272
06:35:47,540 --> 06:35:53,419
Now we can pull him out of this

6273
06:35:53,419 --> 06:35:55,419
rank. And we're gonna do the same thing. I'm getting

6274
06:35:55,419 --> 06:35:57,419
right to see. I feel like he should be there.

6275
06:35:57,419 --> 06:36:07,090
Butter crunch ice cream is underrated. Butter crunch

6276
06:36:07,090 --> 06:36:12,400
ice cream is amazing. People say

6277
06:36:12,400 --> 06:36:14,400
butter pecan, but no. Get the pecans out of there.

6278
06:36:14,400 --> 06:36:21,060
Butter crunch is butter pecan ice cream,

6279
06:36:21,060 --> 06:36:23,299
but no pecans.

6280
06:36:23,299 --> 06:36:26,819
How are things? Need anything today?

6281
06:36:26,819 --> 06:36:29,119
Go ahead. Take a look around. What will

6282
06:36:29,119 --> 06:36:31,119
you do? All right. What do we got?

6283
06:36:31,119 --> 06:36:37,259
Effect.

6284
06:36:37,259 --> 06:36:39,259
Got any more training gadgets I can buy?

6285
06:36:39,259 --> 06:36:41,630
I already have this.

6286
06:36:41,630 --> 06:36:43,630
Tub, trampoline,

6287
06:36:43,630 --> 06:36:45,630
target, book.

6288
06:36:45,630 --> 06:36:47,630
That's the one thing I do not have.

6289
06:36:53,889 --> 06:36:57,599
Shit. It's one by two?

6290
06:37:01,599 --> 06:37:04,290
I have enough room, don't I?

6291
06:37:04,290 --> 06:37:06,290
How's that not enough room?

6292
06:37:17,310 --> 06:37:19,310
Trampoline. Which one's not gonna be used?

6293
06:37:21,310 --> 06:37:24,189
Oh, seven out of seven.

6294
06:37:24,189 --> 06:37:26,189
Oh.

6295
06:37:26,189 --> 06:37:28,189
This thing is so huge.

6296
06:37:30,560 --> 06:37:32,560
I wonder which one

6297
06:37:32,560 --> 06:37:35,569
I should get rid of.

6298
06:37:43,060 --> 06:37:45,060
Maybe the speed for now.

6299
06:37:45,060 --> 06:37:48,319
Just put it away.

6300
06:37:58,459 --> 06:38:00,770
I got everything.

6301
06:38:00,770 --> 06:38:03,330
I don't know.

6302
06:38:03,330 --> 06:38:05,330
No appraisal?

6303
06:38:05,330 --> 06:38:07,700
No.

6304
06:38:07,700 --> 06:38:11,340
Leveling intelligence.

6305
06:38:11,340 --> 06:38:13,340
Yeah. One of the

6306
06:38:13,340 --> 06:38:15,340
monsters I have is an int-based

6307
06:38:15,340 --> 06:38:18,860
Walle is an

6308
06:38:18,860 --> 06:38:23,020
intelligence-based monster.

6309
06:38:23,020 --> 06:38:25,020
Let's queue up some shit.

6310
06:38:25,020 --> 06:38:27,020
Calendar.

6311
06:38:27,020 --> 06:38:29,020
All right.

6312
06:38:29,020 --> 06:38:31,020
Here you go. Roberto.

6313
06:38:31,020 --> 06:38:33,020
Official tournament. Sign up for it.

6314
06:38:33,020 --> 06:38:35,020
And then the next

6315
06:38:35,020 --> 06:38:37,020
day official tournament for Vroomer.

6316
06:38:37,020 --> 06:38:39,020
And then Walle, who cares?

6317
06:38:39,020 --> 06:38:41,020
I guess Walle could do this one right here

6318
06:38:41,020 --> 06:38:43,020
just to get ready.

6319
06:38:43,020 --> 06:38:45,840
No, I want them to train.

6320
06:38:45,840 --> 06:38:47,840
Walle, you do this one.

6321
06:38:53,409 --> 06:38:55,409
Walle, go read the book.

6322
06:38:55,409 --> 06:38:57,409
Sorry, I wanted you to, yeah. Rest.

6323
06:38:57,409 --> 06:38:59,409
Tub. Tub.

6324
06:38:59,409 --> 06:39:01,970
Rest.

6325
06:39:01,970 --> 06:39:03,970
Lifeblade. Lifeblade.

6326
06:39:03,970 --> 06:39:06,209
Good.

6327
06:39:06,209 --> 06:39:08,209
Book.

6328
06:39:08,209 --> 06:39:11,020
Book.

6329
06:39:13,020 --> 06:39:17,169
Rest.

6330
06:39:17,169 --> 06:39:19,540
And then probably

6331
06:39:19,540 --> 06:39:21,540
Lifeblade.

6332
06:39:21,540 --> 06:39:23,900
You.

6333
06:39:23,900 --> 06:39:25,900
Rest. Lifeblade. Lifeblade.

6334
06:39:25,900 --> 06:39:28,139
Rest. Sandbag.

6335
06:39:28,139 --> 06:39:31,779
No.

6336
06:39:31,779 --> 06:39:33,779
Yeah. Sandbag. Tub. Rest.

6337
06:39:33,779 --> 06:39:44,509
Good to go.

6338
06:39:44,509 --> 06:39:55,459
You can actually read the book. You're so cute.

6339
06:39:55,459 --> 06:39:59,869
Hungry too. Here, come here.

6340
06:40:02,689 --> 06:40:09,779
He's learning.

6341
06:40:09,779 --> 06:40:11,779
His intelligence moves, the

6342
06:40:11,779 --> 06:40:13,779
green moves are the ones that are based on him.

6343
06:40:13,779 --> 06:40:16,139
The more intelligence you have, the more

6344
06:40:16,139 --> 06:40:18,509
damage those moves will do.

6345
06:40:18,509 --> 06:40:22,349
You understand?

6346
06:40:29,310 --> 06:40:32,700
Get in the tub.

6347
06:40:32,700 --> 06:40:35,069
You can rest. No, why?

6348
06:40:35,069 --> 06:40:37,069
You're fine. No, book.

6349
06:40:37,069 --> 06:40:39,069
Book. Double Lifeblade.

6350
06:40:39,069 --> 06:40:41,069
Sounds good to me.

6351
06:40:41,069 --> 06:40:48,930
Nice. After this,

6352
06:40:48,930 --> 06:40:50,930
we're gonna start to do, we're gonna hammer a tournament.

6353
06:40:50,930 --> 06:40:57,900
Frustrated. Oh, no.

6354
06:40:57,900 --> 06:40:59,900
Having trouble with the reading?

6355
06:40:59,900 --> 06:41:02,849
You're just doing okay.

6356
06:41:02,849 --> 06:41:04,849
Let's tell you you're doing a good job.

6357
06:41:04,849 --> 06:41:18,979
I have squid too.

6358
06:41:18,979 --> 06:41:20,979
Alright.

6359
06:41:20,979 --> 06:41:22,979
I gotta get one of these guys

6360
06:41:22,979 --> 06:41:24,979
to like ranks B or A.

6361
06:41:24,979 --> 06:41:28,049
Before they die.

6362
06:41:28,049 --> 06:41:33,939
He's gonna die soon.

6363
06:41:33,939 --> 06:41:43,919
Alright. Tub.

6364
06:41:43,919 --> 06:41:46,990
Frustrated. Have a rest.

6365
06:41:46,990 --> 06:41:48,990
Lifeblade. Rest. Good.

6366
06:41:48,990 --> 06:41:55,009
Just go.

6367
06:41:55,009 --> 06:42:03,009
That was a good amount.

6368
06:42:03,009 --> 06:42:05,009
Yeah, I'm gonna hammer tournaments here.

6369
06:42:05,009 --> 06:42:10,380
I should be able to jump up like two ranks

6370
06:42:10,380 --> 06:42:12,380
real quick. Just do three tournaments

6371
06:42:12,380 --> 06:42:18,659
and four tournaments in a row and win them all.

6372
06:42:18,659 --> 06:42:20,659
Summer. Week four.

6373
06:42:20,659 --> 06:42:23,220
Alright.

6374
06:42:23,220 --> 06:42:25,520
You guys are hungry now.

6375
06:42:25,520 --> 06:42:28,590
You can rest.

6376
06:42:28,590 --> 06:42:32,750
I'll feed you guys all in a minute here.

6377
06:42:32,750 --> 06:42:42,930
Feeding time.

6378
06:42:42,930 --> 06:42:46,830
Here you go.

6379
06:42:46,830 --> 06:42:49,580
No, no. Food.

6380
06:42:49,580 --> 06:42:55,340
Your favorite.

6381
06:42:55,340 --> 06:42:58,290
What a good boy.

6382
06:42:58,290 --> 06:43:02,450
You...

6383
06:43:02,450 --> 06:43:04,450
You're okay.

6384
06:43:04,450 --> 06:43:08,349
You gotta sleep?

6385
06:43:08,349 --> 06:43:10,349
Have a good night? Yeah, it's getting late.

6386
06:43:10,349 --> 06:43:12,590
We'll probably call it here in a little bit.

6387
06:43:12,590 --> 06:43:16,180
After another tournament or two.

6388
06:43:16,180 --> 06:43:19,500
It is getting late.

6389
06:43:19,500 --> 06:43:30,060
It's getting to be just about 2am eastern.

6390
06:43:30,060 --> 06:43:32,689
We will call it fairly soon here.

6391
06:43:32,689 --> 06:43:44,209
I at least want to rank up

6392
06:43:44,209 --> 06:43:48,500
two people. We're gonna start doing that now.

6393
06:43:48,500 --> 06:43:50,860
So this is the

6394
06:43:50,860 --> 06:43:52,860
tournament for Wally.

6395
06:43:52,860 --> 06:44:03,919
Hopefully we can bring Wally up.

6396
06:44:03,919 --> 06:44:05,919
A nice life increase for

6397
06:44:05,919 --> 06:44:08,799
Broomer. That's good.

6398
06:44:08,799 --> 06:44:10,799
I think everyone's good to go. Fight with Wally.

6399
06:44:10,799 --> 06:44:14,049
Yeah, you're good.

6400
06:44:14,049 --> 06:44:16,540
Good. Good.

6401
06:44:16,540 --> 06:44:22,930
Yeah, after

6402
06:44:22,930 --> 06:44:24,930
these tournaments, we'll call it a night.

6403
06:44:24,930 --> 06:44:30,819
And then I think I might...

6404
06:44:30,819 --> 06:44:36,500
I think I might get rid of Wally.

6405
06:44:36,500 --> 06:44:38,500
I'm not sure he's too...

6406
06:44:38,500 --> 06:44:40,500
He's great fusing.

6407
06:44:40,500 --> 06:44:43,119
I would fuse Wally with somebody else.

6408
06:44:43,119 --> 06:44:46,060
I'm gonna have to make somebody else.

6409
06:44:46,060 --> 06:44:50,479
Wally versus Yellow.

6410
06:44:50,479 --> 06:44:52,479
This is an intelligence-based

6411
06:44:52,479 --> 06:44:54,479
enemy. That's fine.

6412
06:44:54,479 --> 06:45:08,110
Wally's really cute, but

6413
06:45:08,110 --> 06:45:12,779
we'll see. If he won, he kills

6414
06:45:12,779 --> 06:45:16,240
this guy, maybe. Oh, Wally hasn't

6415
06:45:16,240 --> 06:45:18,240
moved, too.

6416
06:45:18,240 --> 06:45:34,610
Look at that damage.

6417
06:45:34,610 --> 06:45:36,610
It's like 48.

6418
06:45:36,610 --> 06:45:39,419
We used to see in numbers over 100.

6419
06:45:39,419 --> 06:45:43,970
Gatty's terrible.

6420
06:45:43,970 --> 06:45:49,220
This Gatty would probably give up. No.

6421
06:45:49,220 --> 06:45:52,740
This is really high defense. Maybe it's

6422
06:45:52,740 --> 06:45:54,740
good to keep him around. I wish you could unfreeze.

6423
06:45:54,740 --> 06:45:57,680
Because

6424
06:45:57,680 --> 06:45:59,680
he just has really high defense.

6425
06:45:59,680 --> 06:46:11,180
47.

6426
06:46:11,180 --> 06:46:13,619
How about the gun?

6427
06:46:13,619 --> 06:46:17,389
31%.

6428
06:46:17,389 --> 06:46:20,340
47.

6429
06:46:20,340 --> 06:46:31,090
I mean, this thing has the highest hit percentage.

6430
06:46:31,090 --> 06:46:33,090
It doesn't do very... 34

6431
06:46:33,090 --> 06:46:35,090
damage. Wally, come on. You're really starting to

6432
06:46:35,090 --> 06:46:37,090
get cold

6433
06:46:37,090 --> 06:46:47,139
here. And I do mean that

6434
06:46:47,139 --> 06:46:51,419
very, very literally.

6435
06:46:51,419 --> 06:46:53,419
This is the dog, right?

6436
06:46:53,419 --> 06:46:55,919
This dog is stuck

6437
06:46:55,919 --> 06:46:59,169
in, like,

6438
06:46:59,169 --> 06:47:07,229
wood. You know, they're like,

6439
06:47:07,229 --> 06:47:09,229
oh, bronze, silver. No, this isn't

6440
06:47:09,229 --> 06:47:12,369
your wood. How come they don't do that

6441
06:47:12,369 --> 06:47:14,369
shit? Why is it not wood

6442
06:47:14,369 --> 06:47:16,369
cloth? Cloth, wood,

6443
06:47:16,369 --> 06:47:19,380
stone, bronze.

6444
06:47:19,380 --> 06:47:21,740
That's what it should be.

6445
06:47:21,740 --> 06:47:23,740
Oh, god. Joel just came in with a raid.

6446
06:47:23,740 --> 06:47:26,750
What's going on, guys?

6447
06:47:26,750 --> 06:47:30,959
Thank you, Joel.

6448
06:47:30,959 --> 06:47:32,959
We are currently playing

6449
06:47:32,959 --> 06:47:37,819
Monster Rancher 4. Hope you had a

6450
06:47:37,819 --> 06:47:39,819
good stream. I don't know what we were doing earlier.

6451
06:47:39,819 --> 06:47:42,639
What was Joel just streaming?

6452
06:47:42,639 --> 06:47:53,700
Shitposts?

6453
06:47:53,700 --> 06:47:57,979
A microphone game.

6454
06:47:57,979 --> 06:48:00,349
Well, welcome or drop. Thanks a lot again,

6455
06:48:00,349 --> 06:48:04,450
Joel for the raid.

6456
06:48:04,450 --> 06:48:06,450
It's going to be hard for me to explain what the hell is going on on the screen here.

6457
06:48:06,450 --> 06:48:08,450
But, if you're

6458
06:48:08,450 --> 06:48:10,450
familiar with Monster Rancher,

6459
06:48:10,450 --> 06:48:13,139
you breed monsters and you fight them

6460
06:48:13,139 --> 06:48:15,139
and then you miss

6461
06:48:15,139 --> 06:48:17,139
five to ten times in a row of your moves, because they're only

6462
06:48:17,139 --> 06:48:19,139
at a 27%.

6463
06:48:19,139 --> 06:48:21,139
And then it gets even worse, because now I'm going to

6464
06:48:21,139 --> 06:48:23,139
be at about, yeah, 12%.

6465
06:48:23,139 --> 06:48:28,830
Eventually, I will kill this.

6466
06:48:28,830 --> 06:48:30,830
Or I won't.

6467
06:48:30,830 --> 06:48:32,830
We're actually about to turn this

6468
06:48:32,830 --> 06:48:34,830
monster into

6469
06:48:34,830 --> 06:48:36,830
into Gruul.

6470
06:48:36,830 --> 06:48:38,830
We're going to grind him down and use him as DNA.

6471
06:48:38,830 --> 06:48:40,830
Because he's really proving right now

6472
06:48:40,830 --> 06:48:42,830
just why he

6473
06:48:42,830 --> 06:48:44,830
shouldn't be on the roster.

6474
06:48:44,830 --> 06:48:46,830
He's very cute, though.

6475
06:48:46,830 --> 06:48:53,680
Yeah, they made five of these

6476
06:48:53,680 --> 06:48:55,680
games for console.

6477
06:48:55,680 --> 06:48:57,680
And they made like three for DS.

6478
06:48:57,680 --> 06:49:04,020
And like two for Game Boy Advance.

6479
06:49:04,020 --> 06:49:06,020
Can you do anything? Come on.

6480
06:49:06,020 --> 06:49:08,020
I was just pressing

6481
06:49:08,020 --> 06:49:10,509
L1 right there.

6482
06:49:10,509 --> 06:49:12,509
Because I was really hopeful that I could bring in

6483
06:49:12,509 --> 06:49:15,520
one of my other teammates.

6484
06:49:15,520 --> 06:49:17,520
This is E rank. This is fucking Wood League.

6485
06:49:17,520 --> 06:49:19,520
This is a bad indicator, guys.

6486
06:49:21,950 --> 06:49:23,950
I was killing enemies in one hit

6487
06:49:23,950 --> 06:49:28,299
with the other people.

6488
06:49:28,299 --> 06:49:30,299
And that dog didn't even do anything. Didn't even attack.

6489
06:49:30,299 --> 06:49:41,810
I still won.

6490
06:49:41,810 --> 06:49:45,650
Grind him up. He already has D. Good stats.

6491
06:49:45,650 --> 06:49:48,080
I don't know. What is it?

6492
06:49:48,080 --> 06:49:52,369
Accuracy is just terrible.

6493
06:49:52,369 --> 06:49:54,369
Eight fame's not bad. See, the game can hear

6494
06:49:54,369 --> 06:50:04,669
you guys talking.

6495
06:50:04,669 --> 06:50:06,669
He won all those fights, but he still sucks. Yeah, but he does

6496
06:50:06,669 --> 06:50:08,849
still suck. He's really cute

6497
06:50:08,849 --> 06:50:10,849
and he's really funny and really cool, but he

6498
06:50:10,849 --> 06:50:12,849
doesn't hold a candle to either one of these two.

6499
06:50:12,849 --> 06:50:15,979
Like, watch.

6500
06:50:15,979 --> 06:50:17,979
Take a look at this. Ready?

6501
06:50:17,979 --> 06:50:20,419
Well, not today, but tomorrow.

6502
06:50:20,419 --> 06:50:22,419
Meditation. I thought everyone's good to go.

6503
06:50:22,419 --> 06:50:24,419
I'm kind of tired, but you really need to keep...

6504
06:50:24,419 --> 06:50:26,419
You can rest tomorrow.

6505
06:50:26,419 --> 06:50:29,869
This is Roberto has his tournament.

6506
06:50:29,869 --> 06:50:31,869
This is a rank-up tournament, I think, isn't it?

6507
06:50:31,869 --> 06:50:34,299
These both are rank-up tournaments.

6508
06:50:34,299 --> 06:50:36,299
They gotta be both great.

6509
06:50:36,299 --> 06:50:45,900
Look at those terrible... those bad increases, too.

6510
06:50:45,900 --> 06:50:48,139
Your siblings are doing

6511
06:50:48,139 --> 06:50:50,380
way better than you.

6512
06:50:50,380 --> 06:50:53,459
I'm gonna go skull them. Only one way.

6513
06:50:53,459 --> 06:50:56,720
I've been spoiling them too much.

6514
06:50:56,720 --> 06:51:05,490
No. Alright. No.

6515
06:51:05,490 --> 06:51:07,490
Let me say... I'll be happy. I'll be nice.

6516
06:51:07,490 --> 06:51:09,490
Tenta, thanks for five community subs, Tenta.

6517
06:51:09,490 --> 06:51:13,009
Tenta coming in with five subs.

6518
06:51:13,009 --> 06:51:16,139
Thank you.

6519
06:51:16,139 --> 06:51:19,069
You need to eat.

6520
06:51:19,069 --> 06:51:21,310
Have a potato.

6521
06:51:21,310 --> 06:51:24,259
They won't learn

6522
06:51:24,259 --> 06:51:26,259
if you are kind.

6523
06:51:26,259 --> 06:51:28,560
I've been pretty harsh.

6524
06:51:28,560 --> 06:51:33,599
You've seen me be harsh.

6525
06:51:33,599 --> 06:51:45,869
Alright, here we go.

6526
06:51:45,869 --> 06:51:47,869
Weekends, activities.

6527
06:51:47,869 --> 06:51:49,869
Uh, it's tomorrow.

6528
06:51:49,869 --> 06:51:52,500
Yep.

6529
06:51:52,500 --> 06:51:54,500
No competitions are scheduled this week. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6530
06:51:54,500 --> 06:51:56,740
Wait, hold on.

6531
06:51:56,740 --> 06:51:59,869
Oh, alright.

6532
06:51:59,869 --> 06:52:01,869
It's here and then here, right? Okay.

6533
06:52:01,869 --> 06:52:04,740
Don't scold Wally yet

6534
06:52:04,740 --> 06:52:11,069
since he just won. That's true.

6535
06:52:13,069 --> 06:52:15,069
So now we have...

6536
06:52:15,069 --> 06:52:17,069
You were planning on resting today,

6537
06:52:17,069 --> 06:52:19,069
but I think I'll rest you tomorrow.

6538
06:52:21,069 --> 06:52:23,439
What do you need?

6539
06:52:25,439 --> 06:52:27,439
Lifeblade.

6540
06:52:27,439 --> 06:52:29,439
You...

6541
06:52:29,439 --> 06:52:32,180
You can rest.

6542
06:52:32,180 --> 06:52:34,610
You... it's your tournament, so you rest, too.

6543
06:52:34,610 --> 06:52:36,610
Yeah.

6544
06:52:36,610 --> 06:52:38,610
And then we'll give you...

6545
06:52:38,610 --> 06:52:40,610
We'll give you a good encouragement before you battle.

6546
06:52:40,610 --> 06:52:45,790
Nice.

6547
06:52:45,790 --> 06:52:52,830
German blocked Joel in fear of the message...

6548
06:52:52,830 --> 06:52:58,529
Wait, what?

6549
06:52:58,529 --> 06:53:01,090
Prostrated? That's not good.

6550
06:53:01,090 --> 06:53:05,630
Well, you can relax tomorrow. You don't have to do anything.

6551
06:53:05,630 --> 06:53:07,630
I didn't see it. I didn't see... What did he write?

6552
06:53:07,630 --> 06:53:09,630
Alright, you're good. Lively focused. You're good to go.

6553
06:53:09,630 --> 06:53:13,979
Let's go stomp the E-Ring.

6554
06:53:17,380 --> 06:53:19,380
This is an official grade E competition.

6555
06:53:19,380 --> 06:53:26,669
We should do this fairly easily.

6556
06:53:26,669 --> 06:53:29,680
Why am I playing Neopets?

6557
06:53:29,680 --> 06:53:32,819
You don't know what...

6558
06:53:32,819 --> 06:53:34,819
If you don't know what Monster Rancher is...

6559
06:53:34,819 --> 06:53:37,630
Neopets is like a...

6560
06:53:37,630 --> 06:53:39,630
A JPG game.

6561
06:53:39,630 --> 06:53:42,060
This is real animations on the screen.

6562
06:53:42,060 --> 06:53:44,240
You don't just...

6563
06:53:44,240 --> 06:53:46,669
Watch your character load as a picture on the screen.

6564
06:53:46,669 --> 06:53:53,709
My Neopet hasn't been fed in 10 years.

6565
06:53:55,709 --> 06:53:58,340
Well, that's on you.

6566
06:53:58,340 --> 06:54:00,340
Alright, we know all these people already.

6567
06:54:00,340 --> 06:54:02,340
Sunny is pretty strong.

6568
06:54:02,340 --> 06:54:04,340
But not as strong as Roberto.

6569
06:54:04,340 --> 06:54:06,700
I would assume half these people are going to give up.

6570
06:54:06,700 --> 06:54:13,680
I'm going to go with Double Slash.

6571
06:54:13,680 --> 06:54:17,709
Yeah, we've seen this before.

6572
06:54:17,709 --> 06:54:19,709
We've battled this before.

6573
06:54:19,709 --> 06:54:21,709
Watch this.

6574
06:54:21,709 --> 06:54:25,169
Goodbye.

6575
06:54:25,169 --> 06:54:27,169
You guys want to keep Roberto? No, no.

6576
06:54:27,169 --> 06:54:29,169
You guys want to keep...

6577
06:54:29,169 --> 06:54:31,919
Oh, what's that? Instantly death.

6578
06:54:31,919 --> 06:54:34,479
I don't have like a jokey fucking glove

6579
06:54:34,479 --> 06:54:36,479
come out of my clam.

6580
06:54:36,479 --> 06:54:38,720
And hit seven times in a row.

6581
06:54:38,720 --> 06:54:40,720
No. We just steamroll.

6582
06:54:40,720 --> 06:54:52,560
He loves you though.

6583
06:54:52,560 --> 06:54:54,560
Yeah, but we only have three slots.

6584
06:54:54,560 --> 06:54:56,560
And you can't unfreeze people.

6585
06:54:56,560 --> 06:54:59,439
In Monster Rancher IV

6586
06:54:59,439 --> 06:55:02,189
you cannot bring them back.

6587
06:55:02,189 --> 06:55:04,189
You can only retire them forever.

6588
06:55:04,189 --> 06:55:08,540
And then use them as DNA.

6589
06:55:08,540 --> 06:55:12,380
I don't have to look at these.

6590
06:55:12,380 --> 06:55:14,380
We do Double Slash into Side Slash.

6591
06:55:14,380 --> 06:55:20,770
And that's it.

6592
06:55:20,770 --> 06:55:24,159
Let the other two just carry him.

6593
06:55:24,159 --> 06:55:28,509
I mean, I could.

6594
06:55:28,509 --> 06:55:35,490
He's dead. One hit.

6595
06:55:35,490 --> 06:55:37,790
I don't even need to see their stats.

6596
06:55:37,790 --> 06:55:45,919
He's too good.

6597
06:55:45,919 --> 06:55:50,849
Oh, your opponent quit, by the way.

6598
06:55:50,849 --> 06:56:04,479
Oh, who knew?

6599
06:56:04,479 --> 06:56:06,479
Yeah, that the Transformer was a...

6600
06:56:06,479 --> 06:56:15,630
was going to be the best one.

6601
06:56:15,630 --> 06:56:17,630
You getting cocky? Cocky streamer?

6602
06:56:17,630 --> 06:56:23,459
Kind of. But I think it's worth being

6603
06:56:23,459 --> 06:56:25,459
cocky here, because...

6604
06:56:25,459 --> 06:56:36,139
I mean, seriously.

6605
06:56:36,139 --> 06:56:38,639
I just don't belong in this rank.

6606
06:56:38,639 --> 06:56:40,639
I gotta get up to D and C with

6607
06:56:40,639 --> 06:56:42,639
Roberto. This is way better than everybody here.

6608
06:56:42,639 --> 06:56:46,990
Is it Roberto of rank?

6609
06:56:46,990 --> 06:56:48,990
No. Rumor is rank D.

6610
06:56:48,990 --> 06:56:50,990
About to attempt to go to rank C.

6611
06:56:50,990 --> 06:56:54,450
I think I already win.

6612
06:56:54,450 --> 06:56:57,900
Yeah, there's no way anybody can come back.

6613
06:56:57,900 --> 06:56:59,900
I just have to win to beat Harris.

6614
06:56:59,900 --> 06:57:04,000
Alright, if I don't one hit kill

6615
06:57:04,000 --> 06:57:06,000
Harris, I will give 5,000 community subs.

6616
06:57:06,000 --> 06:57:15,279
I'm kidding.

6617
06:57:15,279 --> 06:57:17,279
I'm kidding. That's a joke, by the way.

6618
06:57:17,279 --> 06:57:21,380
Technically didn't hit him yet.

6619
06:57:21,380 --> 06:57:23,380
Technically didn't hit him.

6620
06:57:23,380 --> 06:57:25,380
I swung, but I missed one hit.

6621
06:57:25,380 --> 06:57:28,830
Technically didn't hit him.

6622
06:57:28,830 --> 06:57:35,549
Didn't hit him.

6623
06:57:35,549 --> 06:57:41,500
I have to hit him. Alright, that's...

6624
06:57:41,500 --> 06:57:47,459
I told you it was a joke already.

6625
06:57:47,459 --> 06:57:49,459
I told you immediately it was a joke.

6626
06:57:49,459 --> 06:57:51,630
I can't do that.

6627
06:57:51,630 --> 06:57:54,770
I'll go to jail if I do that.

6628
06:57:54,770 --> 06:57:56,770
By the way, April Fools.

6629
06:57:56,770 --> 06:58:00,159
You believed it? Unbelievable.

6630
06:58:00,159 --> 06:58:03,229
April Fools.

6631
06:58:03,229 --> 06:58:05,229
You know those things that people say

6632
06:58:05,229 --> 06:58:07,229
on April Fools and it's like, whoa, what the fuck?

6633
06:58:07,229 --> 06:58:09,229
Is that real? Is that shit real?

6634
06:58:09,229 --> 06:58:11,229
Nope. Not today.

6635
06:58:11,229 --> 06:58:13,229
Not on this special day.

6636
06:58:13,229 --> 06:58:15,229
I can say whatever I want. I can tell you.

6637
06:58:15,229 --> 06:58:17,229
Hey, I'm like 6'2". April fucking Fools.

6638
06:58:17,229 --> 06:58:19,229
I can say whatever I want. Today is the day where you can say anything you want.

6639
06:58:19,229 --> 06:58:24,930
You already did a joke.

6640
06:58:24,930 --> 06:58:36,580
I ate a cereal I like.

6641
06:58:39,779 --> 06:58:43,360
Dude, you guys understand how much that is.

6642
06:58:43,360 --> 06:58:45,360
The comedy cereal was not April Fools.

6643
06:58:45,360 --> 06:58:48,240
It was just comedy cereal.

6644
06:58:48,240 --> 06:58:50,240
I just said as an April Fools joke,

6645
06:58:50,240 --> 06:58:52,240
I'm gonna give 5,000 community subs if I don't one hit this person.

6646
06:58:52,240 --> 06:58:54,240
It was an April Fools gag.

6647
06:58:54,240 --> 06:58:57,380
It's 25,000 dollars.

6648
06:59:04,860 --> 06:59:11,389
25,000 dollars.

6649
06:59:11,389 --> 06:59:17,729
Holy fuck.

6650
06:59:17,729 --> 06:59:20,740
Yeah, I get to have...

6651
06:59:20,740 --> 06:59:22,740
I get to have my April Fools joke.

6652
06:59:22,740 --> 06:59:24,740
That's what it was.

6653
06:59:24,740 --> 06:59:26,979
Thank god this is today.

6654
06:59:26,979 --> 06:59:28,979
Thank god it's like April Fools everywhere in the world right now.

6655
06:59:28,979 --> 06:59:30,979
Because that's my excuse.

6656
06:59:30,979 --> 06:59:32,979
And it's a good one.

6657
06:59:32,979 --> 06:59:34,979
If this was any other day.

6658
06:59:34,979 --> 06:59:38,939
It's the fucking liar day.

6659
06:59:38,939 --> 06:59:45,860
You need to press.

6660
06:59:49,950 --> 06:59:52,580
It's 11pm for me.

6661
06:59:52,580 --> 06:59:54,580
I'm speaking to you. It's midnight for you.

6662
07:00:03,790 --> 07:00:07,310
Why did I even say that?

6663
07:00:07,310 --> 07:00:09,310
I know it was like I was doing an April Fools thing but...

6664
07:00:09,310 --> 07:00:11,680
I'm not fucking doing that.

6665
07:00:11,680 --> 07:00:13,680
Are you kidding me?

6666
07:00:13,680 --> 07:00:15,860
That would like ruin me.

6667
07:00:15,860 --> 07:00:32,799
Constellation prize?

6668
07:00:32,799 --> 07:00:34,799
Alright, fine. I'll play Minecraft VR for like 30 minutes.

6669
07:00:34,799 --> 07:00:37,549
In like a week or two.

6670
07:00:37,549 --> 07:00:55,389
Alright, you're fed.

6671
07:00:55,389 --> 07:01:00,770
Uh, you're okay.

6672
07:01:00,770 --> 07:01:02,770
I'm gonna feed you.

6673
07:01:02,770 --> 07:01:06,459
Leave a carrot.

6674
07:01:06,459 --> 07:01:08,459
You already owe us Minecraft VR.

6675
07:01:08,459 --> 07:01:19,150
Five fucking thousand community subs.

6676
07:01:19,150 --> 07:01:21,150
Five fucking thousand community subs.

6677
07:01:23,150 --> 07:01:25,150
Thank god it's April Fools.

6678
07:01:25,150 --> 07:01:30,459
What's the worst thing you've ever smelled?

6679
07:01:30,459 --> 07:01:32,459
One time there were eggs in the sink.

6680
07:01:32,459 --> 07:01:34,830
And they were wet.

6681
07:01:34,830 --> 07:01:39,060
And it ruined my whole afternoon.

6682
07:01:39,060 --> 07:01:41,360
The cooked eggs.

6683
07:01:44,819 --> 07:01:46,819
Yeah, wet eggs is the worst thing you could ever fucking smell in your life.

6684
07:01:46,819 --> 07:01:49,310
Alright, this is the one.

6685
07:01:49,310 --> 07:01:51,680
This is the one that actually really matters.

6686
07:01:51,680 --> 07:01:53,680
Because this is the go to rank C.

6687
07:01:53,680 --> 07:02:09,939
Only the winner will move on.

6688
07:02:09,939 --> 07:02:12,180
And we have rumor versus third.

6689
07:02:14,180 --> 07:02:20,319
Very balanced. High intelligence.

6690
07:02:20,319 --> 07:02:22,500
Decent speed.

6691
07:02:22,500 --> 07:02:25,759
But what about me?

6692
07:02:25,759 --> 07:02:29,540
216, 194.

6693
07:02:29,540 --> 07:02:35,740
Come on, I'm unstoppable here.

6694
07:02:35,740 --> 07:02:37,740
Never forget the five thousand subs.

6695
07:02:44,270 --> 07:02:46,580
It's April Fools.

6696
07:02:46,580 --> 07:02:48,580
I can say whatever the fuck I want.

6697
07:02:48,580 --> 07:02:52,479
Hey guys, my book will be done in like

6698
07:02:52,479 --> 07:02:54,479
two or three days.

6699
07:02:54,479 --> 07:03:01,900
It's like 1700 pages.

6700
07:03:01,900 --> 07:03:03,900
Whatever the fuck you want on April Fools.

6701
07:03:03,900 --> 07:03:06,720
All encompassing.

6702
07:03:06,720 --> 07:03:17,860
Any lie. You can say anything.

6703
07:03:17,860 --> 07:03:21,380
Tornado.

6704
07:03:21,380 --> 07:03:24,189
Not bad. Okay, let's go with a charge.

6705
07:03:24,189 --> 07:03:36,740
It's a good dodge.

6706
07:03:36,740 --> 07:03:41,779
Super claw.

6707
07:03:41,779 --> 07:03:43,779
I'm fine.

6708
07:03:43,779 --> 07:03:46,209
Let's head back. Let's get the guarantee here.

6709
07:03:46,209 --> 07:03:49,470
Zero to sixty. Sixty percent.

6710
07:03:49,470 --> 07:04:02,340
Get out of my life.

6711
07:04:02,340 --> 07:04:04,340
Colorado versus estate. I don't think we've even seen estate yet.

6712
07:04:04,340 --> 07:04:10,029
How do I feel about chat?

6713
07:04:10,029 --> 07:04:12,029
Well there's 3630 people here.

6714
07:04:12,029 --> 07:04:16,029
I think 3629 of them are amazing.

6715
07:04:16,029 --> 07:04:18,340
The one is one person. I don't know.

6716
07:04:18,340 --> 07:04:20,340
I'm not going to say who it is.

6717
07:04:20,340 --> 07:04:22,340
I hate them. There's one person here.

6718
07:04:22,340 --> 07:04:25,470
I'm not going to say who it is.

6719
07:04:25,470 --> 07:04:27,470
3602. I love

6720
07:04:27,470 --> 07:04:30,159
3601.

6721
07:04:30,159 --> 07:04:32,159
There's one person here. I don't like them.

6722
07:04:32,159 --> 07:04:35,810
That's the way it is.

6723
07:04:35,810 --> 07:04:37,810
Rumor versus estate. Estate lost the last match.

6724
07:04:37,810 --> 07:04:41,389
High intelligence.

6725
07:04:41,389 --> 07:04:43,389
Let's just burn you down with

6726
07:04:43,389 --> 07:04:53,180
power moves.

6727
07:04:53,180 --> 07:04:55,810
Joel, isn't it?

6728
07:04:55,810 --> 07:04:59,840
I don't want to say anything.

6729
07:04:59,840 --> 07:05:08,529
Thunder. Thank god.

6730
07:05:08,529 --> 07:05:10,529
It didn't hurt that much.

6731
07:05:10,529 --> 07:05:12,529
Zero to sixty. Sixty seven percent.

6732
07:05:12,529 --> 07:05:14,900
Get it.

6733
07:05:14,900 --> 07:05:16,900
That sucks to lose that. But I'm going to go for it again because

6734
07:05:16,900 --> 07:05:18,900
I max bet.

6735
07:05:18,900 --> 07:05:25,090
It was worth it. See?

6736
07:05:25,090 --> 07:05:28,290
I've got to chill the fuck out here.

6737
07:05:28,290 --> 07:05:32,450
I have no guts now.

6738
07:05:32,450 --> 07:05:37,380
Joel is... No, that's fine.

6739
07:05:37,380 --> 07:05:39,380
I told you I didn't want to say.

6740
07:05:39,380 --> 07:05:41,380
That doesn't mean who it is.

6741
07:05:41,380 --> 07:05:45,470
I'm not comfortable saying.

6742
07:05:45,470 --> 07:05:49,950
Holy shit.

6743
07:05:49,950 --> 07:05:51,950
That was a ton of damage. I've got to end this right now.

6744
07:05:51,950 --> 07:05:54,259
I've got to charge in right now.

6745
07:05:54,259 --> 07:05:56,259
Get it.

6746
07:05:56,259 --> 07:05:59,389
Come on. Yes. Thank god.

6747
07:05:59,389 --> 07:06:01,389
A huge bitch just came in.

6748
07:06:01,389 --> 07:06:05,740
Kristen, thanks for the fifty dollars.

6749
07:06:05,740 --> 07:06:07,740
Kristen with fifty bucks, five thousand bits.

6750
07:06:07,740 --> 07:06:10,049
They say, I hope one day you can stop

6751
07:06:10,049 --> 07:06:12,049
hating me.

6752
07:06:12,049 --> 07:06:18,060
Rewind to the riot.

6753
07:06:18,060 --> 07:06:23,700
Well, that implies that it's you.

6754
07:06:23,700 --> 07:06:25,700
Somebody else said it was ten fifty eight p.m. in Nevada.

6755
07:06:25,700 --> 07:06:27,700
April Fool's my butt time to pay up.

6756
07:06:27,700 --> 07:06:31,659
It doesn't matter.

6757
07:06:31,659 --> 07:06:33,659
I'm going off of... Hold on a second here.

6758
07:06:33,659 --> 07:06:35,659
I'm going off of

6759
07:06:35,659 --> 07:06:37,659
the general UTC time.

6760
07:06:37,659 --> 07:06:41,180
You know, the time zones like

6761
07:06:41,180 --> 07:06:43,180
UTC time

6762
07:06:43,180 --> 07:06:45,180
is just like regular time. GMT.

6763
07:06:45,180 --> 07:06:47,180
UTC.

6764
07:06:47,180 --> 07:06:50,189
What time is it UTC right now?

6765
07:06:50,189 --> 07:06:59,599
Six a.m.

6766
07:06:59,599 --> 07:07:01,599
It's six a.m. April Fool's on UTC.

6767
07:07:01,599 --> 07:07:03,599
That is like the general time

6768
07:07:03,599 --> 07:07:05,599
zone. That's the one

6769
07:07:05,599 --> 07:07:07,599
that everybody... UTC plus

6770
07:07:07,599 --> 07:07:09,599
six. UTC minus four.

6771
07:07:09,599 --> 07:07:12,799
I'm going by UTC.

6772
07:07:12,799 --> 07:07:15,869
I live in PDT.

6773
07:07:15,869 --> 07:07:19,139
But I make my

6774
07:07:19,139 --> 07:07:21,139
jokes in UTC.

6775
07:07:21,139 --> 07:07:30,740
I hope you're interested. High speed on

6776
07:07:30,740 --> 07:07:38,029
Kochi here. You live in a minus

6777
07:07:38,029 --> 07:07:40,029
two time zone. It's actually a minus three

6778
07:07:40,029 --> 07:07:43,169
time zone. You live in PST.

6779
07:07:43,169 --> 07:07:45,169
It's actually Pacific Daylight time now.

6780
07:07:45,169 --> 07:07:48,479
Read a book. I'm sorry.

6781
07:07:48,479 --> 07:07:50,479
Let's go.

6782
07:07:50,479 --> 07:07:52,479
Oh, it's another wheel.

6783
07:07:52,479 --> 07:07:56,580
This is like the bubblegum wheel.

6784
07:07:56,580 --> 07:08:08,209
Wow.

6785
07:08:08,209 --> 07:08:10,509
So cute. It really is.

6786
07:08:10,509 --> 07:08:12,750
Too bad it's going to die.

6787
07:08:12,750 --> 07:08:16,459
It's like a fish.

6788
07:08:16,459 --> 07:08:18,959
It's a bubblegum fish on a wheel.

6789
07:08:18,959 --> 07:08:20,959
Or like a grapefruit slice.

6790
07:08:20,959 --> 07:08:28,189
And if you have to rank C,

6791
07:08:28,189 --> 07:08:32,740
I can't wait. Who is it?

6792
07:08:32,740 --> 07:08:34,740
And do I even have any competition? Definitely not.

6793
07:08:34,740 --> 07:08:36,740
Oh, actually

6794
07:08:36,740 --> 07:08:38,740
Calabrino's not doing terrible.

6795
07:08:38,740 --> 07:08:41,299
Let's see what happens here. All right.

6796
07:08:41,299 --> 07:08:43,299
Calabrino is killing everybody.

6797
07:08:43,299 --> 07:08:47,330
Three and O.

6798
07:08:47,330 --> 07:08:54,939
I gotta be prepared for this.

6799
07:08:54,939 --> 07:08:56,939
The fish is insane to get. I have two CDs

6800
07:08:56,939 --> 07:08:58,939
out of like 200 that has

6801
07:08:58,939 --> 07:09:07,459
fish. Terrible intelligence.

6802
07:09:07,459 --> 07:09:09,459
Decent speed.

6803
07:09:09,459 --> 07:09:26,990
Really not that great.

6804
07:09:26,990 --> 07:09:30,509
Missed.

6805
07:09:30,509 --> 07:09:32,509
Sorry.

6806
07:09:32,509 --> 07:09:34,509
Blocked it, huh?

6807
07:09:34,509 --> 07:09:40,959
Can't block that.

6808
07:09:40,959 --> 07:09:42,959
I'm playing more of this?

6809
07:09:42,959 --> 07:09:44,959
I don't know. That could mean

6810
07:09:44,959 --> 07:09:47,200
there's a lot of meaning there.

6811
07:09:47,200 --> 07:09:49,200
As in, he's dead. He gave up.

6812
07:09:51,200 --> 07:09:53,200
So maybe you're talking about

6813
07:09:53,200 --> 07:09:55,200
you think this is Monster Rancher 2? This is actually

6814
07:09:55,200 --> 07:09:57,200
Monster Rancher 4.

6815
07:09:57,200 --> 07:09:59,200
If you'd like more of this, this is a

6816
07:09:59,200 --> 07:10:01,200
different game. Or more of this, maybe

6817
07:10:01,200 --> 07:10:03,200
you came here like seven hours ago.

6818
07:10:03,200 --> 07:10:05,200
We're still in this one. We're going to keep playing it.

6819
07:10:05,200 --> 07:10:07,200
I'm just making sure I cover all the bases there.

6820
07:10:07,200 --> 07:10:09,200
Answer all your questions.

6821
07:10:09,200 --> 07:10:14,639
All right. This is...

6822
07:10:14,639 --> 07:10:16,639
If Calabrino does this...

6823
07:10:16,639 --> 07:10:19,259
All right. This is bad.

6824
07:10:19,259 --> 07:10:21,259
I have to beat Calabrino or I don't...

6825
07:10:21,259 --> 07:10:24,779
Only one person wins.

6826
07:10:24,779 --> 07:10:31,310
None of these other scrubs matter.

6827
07:10:31,310 --> 07:10:33,490
All right. Here it is. This is for the championship.

6828
07:10:33,490 --> 07:10:35,490
For to rank up.

6829
07:10:35,490 --> 07:10:38,049
Why are you so good? That's why.

6830
07:10:38,049 --> 07:10:40,930
Okay. High intelligence.

6831
07:10:40,930 --> 07:10:43,939
Tons of life. Just watch out for the

6832
07:10:43,939 --> 07:10:45,939
intelligence moves. Defense is terrible though.

6833
07:10:45,939 --> 07:10:49,459
All right. Just watch out for the high

6834
07:10:49,459 --> 07:10:55,790
intelligence moves.

6835
07:10:55,790 --> 07:10:58,159
Wait! You two aren't planning on

6836
07:10:58,159 --> 07:11:00,159
entering the competition. You've got to be kidding me.

6837
07:11:00,159 --> 07:11:04,880
I think you're a little late.

6838
07:11:04,880 --> 07:11:06,880
But I'll beat you in a single punch. Wait, is this...

6839
07:11:06,880 --> 07:11:09,310
Because my Calabrino doesn't

6840
07:11:09,310 --> 07:11:11,310
have any more time to waste on you.

6841
07:11:11,310 --> 07:11:13,310
Oh, this is the...

6842
07:11:13,310 --> 07:11:15,919
This is the lady from the beginning. Right.

6843
07:11:15,919 --> 07:11:24,299
This is her Calabrino.

6844
07:11:24,299 --> 07:11:30,639
Well, I have to beat this.

6845
07:11:30,639 --> 07:11:33,200
Vroomer versus Calabrino.

6846
07:11:33,200 --> 07:11:35,200
Right off the bat.

6847
07:11:35,200 --> 07:11:37,819
What was that?

6848
07:11:37,819 --> 07:11:39,819
Mosquitoes out tonight?

6849
07:11:39,819 --> 07:11:44,049
What was that?

6850
07:11:44,049 --> 07:11:46,049
Mosquitoes out tonight?

6851
07:11:46,049 --> 07:12:03,250
Get the guarantee thing.

6852
07:12:03,250 --> 07:12:05,250
63%. 0-60. Kill it.

6853
07:12:05,250 --> 07:12:08,000
Yes!

6854
07:12:08,000 --> 07:12:10,369
That was a big crit too.

6855
07:12:10,369 --> 07:12:12,369
All right. We're gonna go with the charge.

6856
07:12:12,369 --> 07:12:16,020
And end it.

6857
07:12:16,020 --> 07:12:18,580
All right. Fine. I'm composed.

6858
07:12:18,580 --> 07:12:24,319
Okay. Slow down.

6859
07:12:24,319 --> 07:12:27,119
I only have 22.

6860
07:12:27,119 --> 07:12:29,119
That's not good. That's actually really bad.

6861
07:12:29,119 --> 07:12:31,119
No. What? Mosquitoes out

6862
07:12:31,119 --> 07:12:39,630
tonight?

6863
07:12:39,630 --> 07:12:41,630
17. Come on.

6864
07:12:41,630 --> 07:12:44,900
Goodbye.

6865
07:12:44,900 --> 07:12:46,900
You get to do final guts more than a

6866
07:12:46,900 --> 07:12:50,930
final time.

6867
07:12:50,930 --> 07:13:02,900
You're gonna make 15 of these?

6868
07:13:02,900 --> 07:13:04,900
Oh my god. Why?

6869
07:13:04,900 --> 07:13:07,069
Don't you dare.

6870
07:13:07,069 --> 07:13:10,080
Two fucking revives.

6871
07:13:10,080 --> 07:13:12,080
Oh, what we got? Fucking mosquitoes out tonight?

6872
07:13:12,080 --> 07:13:14,080
All right. Okay. That's not good. This is actually really fucking bad.

6873
07:13:14,080 --> 07:13:20,540
This is terrible.

6874
07:13:20,540 --> 07:13:33,860
I'm dead.

6875
07:13:33,860 --> 07:13:35,860
You got to revive twice.

6876
07:13:35,860 --> 07:13:38,479
What the fuck was that?

6877
07:13:38,479 --> 07:13:40,900
Why?

6878
07:13:40,900 --> 07:13:43,459
Nothing about that was fair.

6879
07:13:43,459 --> 07:13:45,459
He got to come back to life.

6880
07:13:45,459 --> 07:13:48,000
Final time.

6881
07:13:48,000 --> 07:13:52,990
Two final times.

6882
07:13:52,990 --> 07:13:54,990
That's fucking stupid.

6883
07:13:54,990 --> 07:14:09,009
All right. That's it. I'm going fed.

6884
07:14:09,009 --> 07:14:13,740
Now I have to do that all again.

6885
07:14:13,740 --> 07:14:16,689
That was not your fault.

6886
07:14:16,689 --> 07:14:24,220
That was bullshit.

6887
07:14:24,220 --> 07:14:28,130
Oh, yeah.

6888
07:14:28,130 --> 07:14:32,220
Roberto has a rank up, doesn't he?

6889
07:14:32,220 --> 07:14:39,180
Yeah, he does.

6890
07:14:39,180 --> 07:14:41,180
So annoyed by that.

6891
07:14:41,180 --> 07:14:50,020
The credits are gonna be long tonight, you know,

6892
07:14:50,020 --> 07:14:52,020
due to the 5,000 subs.

6893
07:14:52,020 --> 07:14:57,139
You know how fast that would go?

6894
07:14:57,139 --> 07:15:01,939
I'm gonna break my computer.

6895
07:15:01,939 --> 07:15:03,939
All right.

6896
07:15:03,939 --> 07:15:05,939
Let's at least get some good out of this.

6897
07:15:05,939 --> 07:15:10,990
And rank him up.

6898
07:15:10,990 --> 07:15:13,740
Everyone was such a joke.

6899
07:15:13,740 --> 07:15:15,740
And then you get the double final.

6900
07:15:15,740 --> 07:15:19,119
Wait.

6901
07:15:19,119 --> 07:15:21,119
What is this?

6902
07:15:23,119 --> 07:15:25,119
Doesn't even rank up?

6903
07:15:25,119 --> 07:15:27,119
What's going on?

6904
07:15:31,119 --> 07:15:34,259
Did I miss it?

6905
07:15:34,259 --> 07:15:36,259
No, this is yesterday.

6906
07:15:36,259 --> 07:15:38,619
What happened here?

6907
07:15:38,619 --> 07:15:42,020
Did I skip this?

6908
07:15:42,020 --> 07:15:44,020
Oh, fucking Jesus.

6909
07:15:44,020 --> 07:15:46,020
Look at this.

6910
07:15:46,020 --> 07:15:48,189
The next one's all the way in October.

6911
07:15:53,229 --> 07:16:10,900
Oh, no.

6912
07:16:10,900 --> 07:16:12,900
He did rank up. He did.

6913
07:16:12,900 --> 07:16:15,139
He did. He did. He did.

6914
07:16:15,139 --> 07:16:20,580
He did rank up. I remember.

6915
07:16:20,580 --> 07:16:22,580
He was so easy that he ranked up.

6916
07:16:22,580 --> 07:16:26,099
He's now in rank D.

6917
07:16:26,099 --> 07:16:28,099
Yeah, I'll save the game.

6918
07:16:28,099 --> 07:16:30,099
Guys, not tomorrow. The next day.

6919
07:16:30,099 --> 07:16:32,459
We're probably gonna play more of this.

6920
07:16:32,459 --> 07:16:34,459
I wanna beat this game.

6921
07:16:34,459 --> 07:16:39,970
So I will see you guys on

6922
07:16:39,970 --> 07:16:42,400
Tuesday.

6923
07:16:42,400 --> 07:16:44,400
We'll probably go Tuesday, Wednesday.

6924
07:16:44,400 --> 07:16:47,979
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

6925
07:16:47,979 --> 07:16:49,979
I will see you guys on Tuesday.

6926
07:16:49,979 --> 07:16:55,810
And let's do the bits.

6927
07:16:55,810 --> 07:16:57,810
And there was a ton of community subs tonight.

6928
07:16:57,810 --> 07:16:59,810
You'll see them all in a minute here.

6929
07:16:59,810 --> 07:17:05,889
The guild? Oh, don't worry. I won't forget.

6930
07:17:05,889 --> 07:17:08,959
I won't forget about the guild. Don't worry.

6931
07:17:08,959 --> 07:17:10,959
We will determine what we're gonna do with Wally

6932
07:17:10,959 --> 07:17:15,180
in the stream on Tuesday.

6933
07:17:15,180 --> 07:17:18,319
Hope you enjoyed it. That was fun.

6934
07:17:18,319 --> 07:17:20,939
I had a blast. It's definitely better than

6935
07:17:20,939 --> 07:17:23,889
three. And we'll see how much

6936
07:17:23,889 --> 07:17:25,889
better it is than two once we get some more monsters

6937
07:17:25,889 --> 07:17:29,020
in the mix. But let's go back to

6938
07:17:29,020 --> 07:17:31,020
about seven and a half hours ago. Let's read

6939
07:17:31,020 --> 07:17:36,340
some of these bits. Combine

6940
07:17:36,340 --> 07:17:38,340
Wally. Yeah, we'll see what happens.

6941
07:17:38,340 --> 07:17:43,380
We'll see what happens to Wally.

6942
07:17:43,380 --> 07:17:48,240
Will he be used? Okay.

6943
07:17:48,240 --> 07:17:50,240
So now let me get this

6944
07:17:50,240 --> 07:18:09,490
high. Okay, there we go.

6945
07:18:09,490 --> 07:18:14,159
Oh, well this whole thing screwed up.

6946
07:18:14,159 --> 07:18:17,040
Did it? Yeah, it did.

6947
07:18:17,040 --> 07:18:19,409
Well, it looks like

6948
07:18:19,409 --> 07:18:23,180
we're gonna have to start from here.

6949
07:18:23,180 --> 07:18:25,180
Because my stream labs

6950
07:18:25,180 --> 07:18:28,180
decided to stop

6951
07:18:28,180 --> 07:18:30,180
showing anything.

6952
07:18:30,180 --> 07:18:32,180
Up until about

6953
07:18:32,180 --> 07:18:34,180
four hours ago.

6954
07:18:34,180 --> 07:18:39,360
So that's odd. But I'll just use

6955
07:18:39,360 --> 07:18:42,619
the other site. It's just a German

6956
07:18:42,619 --> 07:18:58,500
mustard site.

6957
07:18:58,500 --> 07:19:05,919
Where is that site?

6958
07:19:05,919 --> 07:19:07,919
I had a book...

6959
07:19:07,919 --> 07:19:09,919
I thought I had it bookmarked.

6960
07:19:09,919 --> 07:19:12,799
So I'm gonna link me real quick.

6961
07:19:12,799 --> 07:19:15,619
Why is this not in my bookmarks?

6962
07:19:15,619 --> 07:19:26,750
Stream labs, why do you have to do this?

6963
07:19:26,750 --> 07:19:32,509
It's like, it's like,

6964
07:19:32,509 --> 07:19:34,509
Ipokedex or something. What is it called?

6965
07:19:34,509 --> 07:19:44,880
I know, I know one of you guys got one.

6966
07:19:44,880 --> 07:19:46,880
Not the Ipokedex.

6967
07:19:46,880 --> 07:19:57,229
Why must you do

6968
07:19:57,229 --> 07:20:08,240
this to me, stream labs?

6969
07:20:08,240 --> 07:20:12,080
Let me see if I can pull it from here.

6970
07:20:12,080 --> 07:20:14,080
Yeah, because right now it's only showing me from the last like

6971
07:20:14,080 --> 07:20:16,580
two hours now. It's all

6972
07:20:16,580 --> 07:20:18,580
fucked up. Why?

6973
07:20:18,580 --> 07:20:35,900
What the hell?

6974
07:20:35,900 --> 07:20:46,400
Let's see if I can find the site.

6975
07:20:46,400 --> 07:20:48,400
Does anybody have a link to this site? Does anybody remember

6976
07:20:48,400 --> 07:20:50,700
what this site was? Because it's not in my

6977
07:20:50,700 --> 07:21:02,029
bookmarks. No, it's not.

6978
07:21:02,029 --> 07:21:21,939
That's not it. Yeah, I'm checking

6979
07:21:21,939 --> 07:21:23,939
my history for it. I don't know why it's not here.

6980
07:21:23,939 --> 07:21:25,939
We used it like, not even like a

6981
07:21:25,939 --> 07:21:40,590
month ago.

6982
07:21:40,590 --> 07:21:42,590
That is the site?

6983
07:21:42,590 --> 07:21:50,659
Is it? The URL changed.

6984
07:21:50,659 --> 07:21:55,389
Oh. That's probably why.

6985
07:21:55,389 --> 07:22:06,270
Oh shit, yeah.

6986
07:22:06,270 --> 07:22:11,069
We weren't memeing you.

6987
07:22:11,069 --> 07:22:17,020
I was wondering, I was like, why the hell can I not

6988
07:22:17,020 --> 07:22:28,159
see it? It's a .org.

6989
07:22:28,159 --> 07:22:40,319
The layout looks great. Yeah,

6990
07:22:40,319 --> 07:22:42,319
whoever put this together, with somebody in the

6991
07:22:42,319 --> 07:22:44,319
community, did a hell of a job.

6992
07:22:44,319 --> 07:22:47,330
This is beautiful.

6993
07:22:47,330 --> 07:22:55,970
I should just fucking use this only.

6994
07:22:55,970 --> 07:22:58,849
Yeah, lazy look, right?

6995
07:22:58,849 --> 07:23:01,020
Alright, so let's go

6996
07:23:01,020 --> 07:23:13,619
earlier.

6997
07:23:13,619 --> 07:23:18,419
So we had mostly

6998
07:23:18,419 --> 07:23:21,229
lost. Thank you for the 250.

6999
07:23:21,229 --> 07:23:24,619
I'm going to say, hey Jimmy,

7000
07:23:24,619 --> 07:23:26,619
any thoughts of jumping on the GTA

7001
07:23:26,619 --> 07:23:28,619
RP gravy train? I've been

7002
07:23:28,619 --> 07:23:30,619
enjoying watching it a ton and you'd probably be great at it.

7003
07:23:30,619 --> 07:23:32,619
We actually talked about it

7004
07:23:32,619 --> 07:23:35,119
not too long ago.

7005
07:23:35,119 --> 07:23:37,490
A few streams ago I think about how

7006
07:23:37,490 --> 07:23:39,490
I love RP.

7007
07:23:39,490 --> 07:23:41,490
I love doing routines and bits.

7008
07:23:41,490 --> 07:23:43,490
But

7009
07:23:43,490 --> 07:23:45,490
I don't really do, I don't do well with

7010
07:23:45,490 --> 07:23:47,729
strangers.

7011
07:23:47,729 --> 07:23:49,729
And when there's like more than 3, 4, 5, 6 people on

7012
07:23:49,729 --> 07:23:51,729
the screen, everyone's doing their own routine.

7013
07:23:51,729 --> 07:23:53,729
It's

7014
07:23:53,729 --> 07:23:55,729
almost like you kind of wait in line to tell your joke.

7015
07:23:55,729 --> 07:23:58,029
And I'm more comfortable

7016
07:23:58,029 --> 07:24:00,029
doing it with people that I know, people that I know that I know I can

7017
07:24:00,029 --> 07:24:02,029
bounce off of really easily.

7018
07:24:02,029 --> 07:24:07,470
It's not that I can't do it

7019
07:24:07,470 --> 07:24:10,479
or don't want to do it, but

7020
07:24:10,479 --> 07:24:12,479
it's just something I would rather not do.

7021
07:24:12,479 --> 07:24:15,740
There's nothing against

7022
07:24:15,740 --> 07:24:17,740
GTA RP at all. I think it's fucking fantastic

7023
07:24:17,740 --> 07:24:19,740
that people are able to jump on

7024
07:24:19,740 --> 07:24:21,740
and make these characters and have this awesome time.

7025
07:24:21,740 --> 07:24:23,740
It's awesome.

7026
07:24:23,740 --> 07:24:30,340
Don't do it with strangers.

7027
07:24:30,340 --> 07:24:32,340
Yeah, but then you kind of, you gotta get like in a group

7028
07:24:32,340 --> 07:24:34,340
of at least a few people.

7029
07:24:34,340 --> 07:24:36,340
I know there's a few people that

7030
07:24:36,340 --> 07:24:38,340
I know that do it.

7031
07:24:38,340 --> 07:24:40,340
Kiwo does it.

7032
07:24:40,340 --> 07:24:42,340
I think Kiwo's probably the only person

7033
07:24:42,340 --> 07:24:44,770
that I know that does

7034
07:24:44,770 --> 07:24:46,770
GTA RP that I could

7035
07:24:46,770 --> 07:24:48,770
like talk to and be like, hey, yeah,

7036
07:24:48,770 --> 07:24:50,770
let me join you. But don't you

7037
07:24:50,770 --> 07:24:52,770
also have to get like white listed?

7038
07:24:52,770 --> 07:24:56,209
And isn't that

7039
07:24:56,209 --> 07:24:58,209
the process of I would have to be on a list

7040
07:24:58,209 --> 07:25:00,209
and there's priority

7041
07:25:00,209 --> 07:25:02,450
and stuff?

7042
07:25:02,450 --> 07:25:04,450
It's not just something I can just do.

7043
07:25:04,450 --> 07:25:06,450
It's not like, hey, I'm gonna do GTA RP

7044
07:25:06,450 --> 07:25:08,450
tomorrow. I'd have to get like on a

7045
07:25:08,450 --> 07:25:10,450
like a queue, right?

7046
07:25:10,450 --> 07:25:21,500
On some servers?

7047
07:25:21,500 --> 07:25:24,130
Yeah, I mean, maybe. I feel like it's

7048
07:25:24,130 --> 07:25:26,130
hit its apex.

7049
07:25:26,130 --> 07:25:29,009
Is it still something people want to see?

7050
07:25:29,009 --> 07:25:31,009
I mean, maybe I would look into it and see if it was

7051
07:25:31,009 --> 07:25:33,009
something that was possible with a few friends or something.

7052
07:25:33,009 --> 07:25:37,740
Just grease your way in

7053
07:25:37,740 --> 07:25:42,740
with streamer charm. If I

7054
07:25:42,740 --> 07:25:44,740
could go in there with a few friends

7055
07:25:44,740 --> 07:25:47,740
and make something happen

7056
07:25:47,740 --> 07:25:49,740
and play off of people

7057
07:25:49,740 --> 07:25:51,740
that I know, then

7058
07:25:51,740 --> 07:25:53,740
I'm not against it.

7059
07:25:53,740 --> 07:25:58,529
Maybe it's worth a try.

7060
07:25:58,529 --> 07:26:00,900
But we did talk about it a while ago.

7061
07:26:00,900 --> 07:26:02,900
Like last week or so. But thank you.

7062
07:26:02,900 --> 07:26:04,900
Hey, Lazy Luke!

7063
07:26:04,900 --> 07:26:06,900
Speak of the devil. I drew a

7064
07:26:06,900 --> 07:26:08,900
German version of my favorite album cover. No offense

7065
07:26:08,900 --> 07:26:11,779
to your beautiful hair.

7066
07:26:11,779 --> 07:26:14,979
Let's see this. Does this look

7067
07:26:14,979 --> 07:26:18,500
infected? Does this look bald?

7068
07:26:18,500 --> 07:26:21,439
What the hell? Is this

7069
07:26:21,439 --> 07:26:23,439
actually a Sum 41 cover?

7070
07:26:23,439 --> 07:26:31,439
Sum 41?

7071
07:26:31,439 --> 07:26:40,779
That's fucked up.

7072
07:26:40,779 --> 07:26:42,779
That's not safe for fucking work.

7073
07:26:42,779 --> 07:26:46,939
Don't click that if you're at work.

7074
07:26:46,939 --> 07:26:48,939
That looks 4 a.m. Hey, don't click that

7075
07:26:48,939 --> 07:26:50,939
if you're at work at 2 or 3 a.m.

7076
07:26:50,939 --> 07:26:59,500
But thank you, Lazy Luke.

7077
07:26:59,500 --> 07:27:05,970
The website's fucking beautiful, by the way.

7078
07:27:05,970 --> 07:27:07,970
Soharv, thanks for the $2.95.

7079
07:27:07,970 --> 07:27:11,360
Soharv.

7080
07:27:11,360 --> 07:27:13,360
German, will you be reprising your role as alien engineer

7081
07:27:13,360 --> 07:27:15,360
frog actor in the 3D sequel to Crypt Dark?

7082
07:27:15,360 --> 07:27:17,360
Also, did you know that the Rat

7083
07:27:17,360 --> 07:27:19,360
Movie 1 and 2 are rated higher than The Godfather

7084
07:27:19,360 --> 07:27:21,360
1 and 2 on IMDB?

7085
07:27:21,360 --> 07:27:23,360
What a travesty. That should never be a thing.

7086
07:27:23,360 --> 07:27:25,360
I did not know that, but

7087
07:27:25,360 --> 07:27:27,360
yes, I think they're using

7088
07:27:27,360 --> 07:27:29,360
lines

7089
07:27:29,360 --> 07:27:31,360
from Crypt Dark

7090
07:27:31,360 --> 07:27:33,360
in the 3D version. I think they're

7091
07:27:33,360 --> 07:27:35,360
just porting lots of lines over. I haven't been asked

7092
07:27:35,360 --> 07:27:37,360
to record anything new

7093
07:27:37,360 --> 07:27:39,360
yet. Maybe

7094
07:27:39,360 --> 07:27:41,360
I think they're just kind of going to be using the old lines?

7095
07:27:41,360 --> 07:27:43,360
Because it is like a

7096
07:27:43,360 --> 07:27:45,360
reimagining 3D version of it, right?

7097
07:27:45,360 --> 07:27:48,500
We'll see. We will see.

7098
07:27:48,500 --> 07:27:51,630
Thank you, J

7099
07:27:51,630 --> 07:27:53,630
Zanye West for the $10.

7100
07:27:53,630 --> 07:27:56,130
Work put me in charge of monthly charity

7101
07:27:56,130 --> 07:27:58,130
donations, so any leftovers are going

7102
07:27:58,130 --> 07:28:00,130
to the Germ Research Foundation.

7103
07:28:00,130 --> 07:28:03,009
I'll take them.

7104
07:28:03,009 --> 07:28:06,529
Thanks for the $10. Appreciate it,

7105
07:28:06,529 --> 07:28:08,529
J Zanye West

7106
07:28:08,529 --> 07:28:11,970
for the $10.

7107
07:28:11,970 --> 07:28:13,970
Smelly Boy, thanks for the $2.50.

7108
07:28:13,970 --> 07:28:16,139
Remember how they got the

7109
07:28:16,139 --> 07:28:18,139
He Will Not Divide Us

7110
07:28:18,139 --> 07:28:20,139
flag one of those times by honking

7111
07:28:20,139 --> 07:28:22,139
a car horn near it and getting feedback

7112
07:28:22,139 --> 07:28:24,139
from chat? Someone's

7113
07:28:24,139 --> 07:28:26,139
eventually going to figure it out with

7114
07:28:26,139 --> 07:28:28,139
your vrooming car.

7115
07:28:28,139 --> 07:28:30,319
Where you are.

7116
07:28:30,319 --> 07:28:38,500
Uh, I think

7117
07:28:38,500 --> 07:28:40,500
you severely underestimate how many

7118
07:28:40,500 --> 07:28:43,759
busy fucking roads are

7119
07:28:43,759 --> 07:28:50,349
here. Derma lied about

7120
07:28:50,349 --> 07:28:52,349
5k subs, a new fucking user

7121
07:28:52,349 --> 07:28:56,580
name. God. That's just Vegas,

7122
07:28:56,580 --> 07:29:00,220
man. That's just the way it is.

7123
07:29:00,220 --> 07:29:08,029
You live near a NASCAR track.

7124
07:29:08,029 --> 07:29:10,639
I don't know. I have

7125
07:29:10,639 --> 07:29:14,159
no idea. But thank you,

7126
07:29:14,159 --> 07:29:16,159
Smelly Boy. Thank you, Superintendent Chalmers for the $4.

7127
07:29:16,159 --> 07:29:18,159
This is me

7128
07:29:18,159 --> 07:29:20,159
$104 I've given to you.

7129
07:29:20,159 --> 07:29:22,159
Took two years of being subbed and dropping

7130
07:29:22,159 --> 07:29:24,159
100 bits every so often to get there.

7131
07:29:24,159 --> 07:29:26,159
I'm not that one guy who gave

7132
07:29:26,159 --> 07:29:28,159
$600 in two hours,

7133
07:29:28,159 --> 07:29:30,159
but I at least got the boomer batch.

7134
07:29:30,159 --> 07:29:32,159
Take care of me, $604.

7135
07:29:32,159 --> 07:29:34,529
P.S.

7136
07:29:34,529 --> 07:29:36,529
Here's a new picture of Jupiter.

7137
07:29:36,529 --> 07:29:38,959
And it's a new NASA picture.

7138
07:29:38,959 --> 07:29:40,959
Look at that. Beautiful.

7139
07:29:40,959 --> 07:29:47,340
Look at that. Uh, thank you,

7140
07:29:47,340 --> 07:29:50,540
Superintendent Chalmers.

7141
07:29:50,540 --> 07:29:52,540
$600 in five seconds, $600 in

7142
07:29:52,540 --> 07:29:54,540
two years. It's still $600.

7143
07:29:54,540 --> 07:29:56,540
And it's... I'm

7144
07:29:56,540 --> 07:29:59,229
shocked that people

7145
07:29:59,229 --> 07:30:01,229
continue to pay money to me.

7146
07:30:01,229 --> 07:30:03,860
I just hope you still like the streams. I hope you're still

7147
07:30:03,860 --> 07:30:07,819
having a good time. Because

7148
07:30:07,819 --> 07:30:09,819
that's a lot of money to give anybody. It is.

7149
07:30:09,819 --> 07:30:16,659
Thank you.

7150
07:30:16,659 --> 07:30:18,659
And thank you so much to DubSkyDude

7151
07:30:18,659 --> 07:30:22,110
for the 250. Hey, Jerma, back in January

7152
07:30:22,110 --> 07:30:24,110
I gave bits and made a gotcha joke

7153
07:30:24,110 --> 07:30:26,110
saying my friend almost

7154
07:30:26,110 --> 07:30:28,110
died in a walk-in oven. Now

7155
07:30:28,110 --> 07:30:30,110
he's actually in the hospital. That's not good.

7156
07:30:30,110 --> 07:30:32,610
Uh, due to having

7157
07:30:32,610 --> 07:30:34,610
some blood clots. That's not, that's

7158
07:30:34,610 --> 07:30:38,639
not good at all.

7159
07:30:38,639 --> 07:30:40,639
Also, my dad had a heart attack on the same day.

7160
07:30:40,639 --> 07:30:42,639
Both are doing fine now, thankfully.

7161
07:30:42,639 --> 07:30:44,639
Just figured I'd share this bit of

7162
07:30:44,639 --> 07:30:46,639
dark irony. Stay healthy, everyone.

7163
07:30:46,639 --> 07:30:48,639
Well, that's... I'm glad they're doing

7164
07:30:48,639 --> 07:30:53,060
fine. But damn.

7165
07:30:53,060 --> 07:30:57,919
Thankfully they're

7166
07:30:57,919 --> 07:30:59,919
good. Thankfully they're good to go.

7167
07:30:59,919 --> 07:31:04,459
Stay healthy, everyone. That's true.

7168
07:31:04,459 --> 07:31:09,459
Thank you DubSky for the 250.

7169
07:31:09,459 --> 07:31:12,270
Glad everyone's okay.

7170
07:31:12,270 --> 07:31:15,729
ProcefProstar, thanks for the $5.

7171
07:31:15,729 --> 07:31:17,729
Play this visual novel,

7172
07:31:17,729 --> 07:31:19,729
but not Doki Doki Literature Club.

7173
07:31:19,729 --> 07:31:22,099
With a thumbs up guy.

7174
07:31:22,099 --> 07:31:25,229
Uh, this is not

7175
07:31:25,229 --> 07:31:27,229
a visual novel.

7176
07:31:27,229 --> 07:31:29,229
This is a monster breeding simulator.

7177
07:31:29,229 --> 07:31:38,380
Hey, AWildMaril, thanks

7178
07:31:38,380 --> 07:31:40,689
for the $25.

7179
07:31:40,689 --> 07:31:42,689
No message, just $25.

7180
07:31:42,689 --> 07:31:44,930
Thank you so much.

7181
07:31:44,930 --> 07:31:48,639
Cheer 10, cheer 10. 1, 2, 3,

7182
07:31:48,639 --> 07:31:51,389
4, 5. Thank you.

7183
07:31:51,389 --> 07:31:53,389
Thank you, Roguefort, for the

7184
07:31:53,389 --> 07:31:55,389
$11. I await his return.

7185
07:31:55,389 --> 07:31:57,759
And he does the beanbag

7186
07:31:57,759 --> 07:31:59,759
Sonic dab thing.

7187
07:31:59,759 --> 07:32:02,000
It's like an emote, but it's not an emote, it's like a

7188
07:32:02,000 --> 07:32:04,000
little... with the parentheses and stuff.

7189
07:32:04,000 --> 07:32:06,500
Virtual Monster Novel.

7190
07:32:06,500 --> 07:32:11,490
Yeah, there you go. There... I don't think

7191
07:32:11,490 --> 07:32:13,490
there is a beanbag Sonic in this game.

7192
07:32:13,490 --> 07:32:15,490
The beanbag monster, I don't think exists.

7193
07:32:15,490 --> 07:32:17,490
It might, maybe we'll unlock it.

7194
07:32:17,490 --> 07:32:21,060
We'll have to see.

7195
07:32:21,060 --> 07:32:23,060
Something or other, thanks for the 250.

7196
07:32:23,060 --> 07:32:25,360
If you fuse rumor with your dog,

7197
07:32:25,360 --> 07:32:27,360
would it be called the automobile?

7198
07:32:27,360 --> 07:32:31,819
Yeah, probably.

7199
07:32:31,819 --> 07:32:34,000
That's a good one.

7200
07:32:34,000 --> 07:32:38,220
Thank you, Freudian Weapon, for the 250.

7201
07:32:38,220 --> 07:32:41,549
Just $2.50, thank you

7202
07:32:41,549 --> 07:32:46,159
so much.

7203
07:32:46,159 --> 07:32:48,159
Felix, thank you, Felix Felis, for the $5.

7204
07:32:48,159 --> 07:32:50,159
Hey, Jeremy, I know how much you

7205
07:32:50,159 --> 07:32:52,159
liked the last Germacorn,

7206
07:32:52,159 --> 07:32:54,159
so I had a few people on the Discord make some

7207
07:32:54,159 --> 07:32:56,159
more variants. I just know one of these has to be

7208
07:32:56,159 --> 07:32:58,159
a new emote. Germacorn for life.

7209
07:32:58,159 --> 07:33:02,319
My god.

7210
07:33:02,319 --> 07:33:10,700
Okay,

7211
07:33:10,700 --> 07:33:12,700
the second one is Germamustard.

7212
07:33:12,700 --> 07:33:17,439
The first one is wild.

7213
07:33:17,439 --> 07:33:19,439
I like that first one.

7214
07:33:19,439 --> 07:33:26,720
They're all great.

7215
07:33:26,720 --> 07:33:28,720
They're all perfectly nightmare inducing.

7216
07:33:28,720 --> 07:33:37,619
That's a good Jeremy

7217
07:33:37,619 --> 07:33:39,619
got scared emote, isn't it?

7218
07:33:39,619 --> 07:33:44,220
The last one

7219
07:33:44,220 --> 07:33:46,220
is really good. Yeah, but the

7220
07:33:46,220 --> 07:33:48,220
last one is just Jerva Disgust

7221
07:33:48,220 --> 07:33:50,220
put on corn this time.

7222
07:33:50,220 --> 07:33:59,040
Thank you for those.

7223
07:33:59,040 --> 07:34:01,040
I need to have... I got more slots. I gotta do

7224
07:34:01,040 --> 07:34:03,040
a lot of artwork stuff for this

7225
07:34:03,040 --> 07:34:05,040
channel. We need more stuff.

7226
07:34:05,040 --> 07:34:12,259
Those are all great, though.

7227
07:34:12,259 --> 07:34:14,259
Thank you Manboy for the $2.50.

7228
07:34:14,259 --> 07:34:16,500
I wanted to share this image

7229
07:34:16,500 --> 07:34:18,500
that Kroskinael...

7230
07:34:18,500 --> 07:34:21,310
Kroskinael

7231
07:34:21,310 --> 07:34:23,310
made after discussion in the

7232
07:34:23,310 --> 07:34:26,959
sub-Discord. The

7233
07:34:26,959 --> 07:34:35,790
Fire family.

7234
07:34:35,790 --> 07:34:40,400
This is awesome. Fire grandpa.

7235
07:34:40,400 --> 07:34:48,529
Look at Babyfire.

7236
07:34:48,529 --> 07:34:51,220
This is great.

7237
07:34:51,220 --> 07:34:54,099
Fire dog. Fire dog

7238
07:34:54,099 --> 07:34:56,099
had better have that hair

7239
07:34:56,099 --> 07:34:58,099
on his tail.

7240
07:34:58,099 --> 07:35:00,099
You know, that's a perfect place for it.

7241
07:35:00,099 --> 07:35:08,400
That's wonderful.

7242
07:35:08,400 --> 07:35:15,569
Thank you Kroskinael.

7243
07:35:15,569 --> 07:35:26,900
Those are wonderful. All of those

7244
07:35:26,900 --> 07:35:28,900
are just so charming and wonderful. Thank you.

7245
07:35:28,900 --> 07:35:32,349
Feroidian Weapon. Another $2.50.

7246
07:35:32,349 --> 07:35:35,680
No message, just

7247
07:35:35,680 --> 07:35:39,580
$2.50. Thank you.

7248
07:35:39,580 --> 07:35:41,759
Easy Pants. Thank you for the $10

7249
07:35:41,759 --> 07:35:44,319
Easy Pants. Hey Jeremy Boy.

7250
07:35:44,319 --> 07:35:46,319
I hope you had a great time streaming today.

7251
07:35:46,319 --> 07:35:48,319
Quick question. Any tips on

7252
07:35:48,319 --> 07:35:50,319
getting fit and exercising? I want to start

7253
07:35:50,319 --> 07:35:52,319
living a healthier lifestyle.

7254
07:35:52,319 --> 07:35:54,319
Any advice would be appreciated.

7255
07:35:54,319 --> 07:35:57,840
Easiest advice is drink more water.

7256
07:35:57,840 --> 07:36:00,659
Cut out some of the bullshit that

7257
07:36:00,659 --> 07:36:02,659
you're eating. I know I had to make the jokes

7258
07:36:02,659 --> 07:36:04,659
about the fucking cereal bullshit.

7259
07:36:04,659 --> 07:36:06,659
But in all honesty,

7260
07:36:06,659 --> 07:36:08,659
cut out

7261
07:36:08,659 --> 07:36:10,659
all like the sugary fucking

7262
07:36:10,659 --> 07:36:12,659
Gatorade drinks you drink and all the

7263
07:36:12,659 --> 07:36:15,220
sodas. You wouldn't

7264
07:36:15,220 --> 07:36:17,709
believe with just like

7265
07:36:17,709 --> 07:36:19,709
removing like two shitty drinks

7266
07:36:19,709 --> 07:36:21,709
a day if you're drinking them.

7267
07:36:21,709 --> 07:36:24,400
Get rid of energy drinks.

7268
07:36:24,400 --> 07:36:26,400
Don't drink those fucking things.

7269
07:36:26,400 --> 07:36:28,400
Drink coffee. Just drink like black coffee

7270
07:36:28,400 --> 07:36:31,729
instead. Or even like a little bit

7271
07:36:31,729 --> 07:36:36,270
of cream, that's fine. Drink more

7272
07:36:36,270 --> 07:36:38,770
water. Cut out some of the bullshit.

7273
07:36:38,770 --> 07:36:42,799
Eat more fish.

7274
07:36:42,799 --> 07:36:45,810
That's, I'm serious.

7275
07:36:45,810 --> 07:36:48,110
That's a meme on this channel, but it's for real.

7276
07:36:48,110 --> 07:36:54,189
Coffee's bad for your sleeping

7277
07:36:54,189 --> 07:36:56,189
schedule. Well if you don't,

7278
07:36:56,189 --> 07:36:58,189
don't drink coffee after like 7 or like

7279
07:36:58,189 --> 07:37:00,189
6 p.m. If you drink coffee at like

7280
07:37:00,189 --> 07:37:02,189
you know, 8, 9, 10, 11

7281
07:37:02,189 --> 07:37:04,189
o'clock in the morning, that's fine.

7282
07:37:04,189 --> 07:37:07,200
I've been drinking coffee for years.

7283
07:37:07,200 --> 07:37:09,569
And my sleep is terrible. So don't

7284
07:37:09,569 --> 07:37:14,619
listen to me. Go for a walk?

7285
07:37:14,619 --> 07:37:17,180
Yeah. And move around too.

7286
07:37:17,180 --> 07:37:19,180
Don't let your body just be like complacent

7287
07:37:19,180 --> 07:37:21,549
and just sit. Sitting

7288
07:37:21,549 --> 07:37:23,549
is actually so bad for you. It just is.

7289
07:37:23,549 --> 07:37:26,430
You put more compression

7290
07:37:26,430 --> 07:37:28,430
on your spine when you sit down than when you

7291
07:37:28,430 --> 07:37:32,720
do anything else. Just move around.

7292
07:37:32,720 --> 07:37:35,790
Take a little walk. 20 minutes a day.

7293
07:37:35,790 --> 07:37:38,610
Not even. 20 minutes

7294
07:37:38,610 --> 07:37:42,700
every couple days. Take a walk.

7295
07:37:42,700 --> 07:37:44,700
7 and a half hours of sitting. Yeah.

7296
07:37:44,700 --> 07:37:46,700
And you know what I'm going to do tomorrow?

7297
07:37:46,700 --> 07:37:48,700
I'm going to take a walk.

7298
07:37:48,700 --> 07:37:51,709
I'm going to get up and I'm going to fucking do

7299
07:37:51,709 --> 07:37:53,709
two push-ups because that's all I can do.

7300
07:37:53,709 --> 07:37:56,340
But for real.

7301
07:37:56,340 --> 07:37:59,409
I do two miles a day and honestly I've never

7302
07:37:59,409 --> 07:38:03,759
felt better. There you go.

7303
07:38:03,759 --> 07:38:05,759
Just stay active. And staying active doesn't necessarily

7304
07:38:05,759 --> 07:38:07,759
even need to, you don't have to like go to the gym and lift

7305
07:38:07,759 --> 07:38:09,759
250 pounds in a bench press.

7306
07:38:09,759 --> 07:38:11,939
You don't got to go to the gym

7307
07:38:11,939 --> 07:38:14,560
five times a week.

7308
07:38:14,560 --> 07:38:16,560
Stuff as simple as just being

7309
07:38:16,560 --> 07:38:19,180
active is so good for

7310
07:38:19,180 --> 07:38:27,180
your health. Consistently

7311
07:38:27,180 --> 07:38:29,419
active helps.

7312
07:38:29,419 --> 07:38:38,580
But thank you EasyPants. Hopefully some of that

7313
07:38:38,580 --> 07:38:42,669
helps you. Thanks for the 10 bucks.

7314
07:38:42,669 --> 07:38:45,419
Garfield the Bunday Killer.

7315
07:38:45,419 --> 07:38:47,419
Hello Garfield. Thank you for the five dollars.

7316
07:38:47,419 --> 07:38:49,919
Five dollars.

7317
07:38:49,919 --> 07:38:52,349
Back to back here.

7318
07:38:52,349 --> 07:38:54,349
Another Monster Rancher sure does bring back memories

7319
07:38:54,349 --> 07:38:56,349
doesn't it Jerma? Remember when I began donating

7320
07:38:56,349 --> 07:38:58,349
all my Garphographs the day that Beam Bag

7321
07:38:58,349 --> 07:39:01,229
Sonic was born?

7322
07:39:01,229 --> 07:39:03,229
That is where you came from isn't it? It feels like

7323
07:39:03,229 --> 07:39:05,229
the only yesterday Garfield

7324
07:39:05,229 --> 07:39:07,409
started donating. Monster Rancher

7325
07:39:07,409 --> 07:39:09,409
4 is actually how I got familiar with this

7326
07:39:09,409 --> 07:39:11,409
series Jerma. I had a floating

7327
07:39:11,409 --> 07:39:13,409
rabbit with a mallet

7328
07:39:13,409 --> 07:39:15,409
as one of my monsters. It warms

7329
07:39:15,409 --> 07:39:17,409
it warms a cat's heart seeing

7330
07:39:17,409 --> 07:39:19,409
a Jerma and his pets. I'm getting all teary eyed

7331
07:39:19,409 --> 07:39:21,409
Jerma. All this emotion and I don't

7332
07:39:21,409 --> 07:39:23,409
even have a Jerma anniversary gift.

7333
07:39:23,409 --> 07:39:26,220
It's alright.

7334
07:39:26,220 --> 07:39:31,409
April Fool's Special.

7335
07:39:31,409 --> 07:39:33,900
Yeah it's called I'm going out with my

7336
07:39:33,900 --> 07:39:36,779
girlfriend. For

7337
07:39:36,779 --> 07:39:42,990
real. Not joke.

7338
07:39:42,990 --> 07:39:44,990
Garfield the Monday Killer again. Here's the rest of you five dollars.

7339
07:39:44,990 --> 07:39:46,990
Here I found the Garf-versary

7340
07:39:46,990 --> 07:39:48,990
present. That's right. Hope you like it.

7341
07:39:48,990 --> 07:39:50,990
Maybe even show it on stream. You don't have to

7342
07:39:50,990 --> 07:39:52,990
show it on stream. Okay.

7343
07:39:52,990 --> 07:39:55,229
Took me about a month to do.

7344
07:39:55,229 --> 07:39:57,979
Hope you like it. Hang it on

7345
07:39:57,979 --> 07:39:59,979
your wall. You must hang it on your wall.

7346
07:39:59,979 --> 07:40:01,979
I'm just Garfing with you mate.

7347
07:40:01,979 --> 07:40:03,979
Also want to thank Chat for being there and my

7348
07:40:03,979 --> 07:40:05,979
mother back

7349
07:40:05,979 --> 07:40:07,979
at the Italian restaurant.

7350
07:40:07,979 --> 07:40:10,419
Happy Garf-versary Jerma. Let's see here.

7351
07:40:10,419 --> 07:40:17,779
There's a lot of Garfields.

7352
07:40:17,779 --> 07:40:20,720
Why does Garfield have a Miss Piggy

7353
07:40:20,720 --> 07:40:22,720
Puppet? I don't understand that.

7354
07:40:22,720 --> 07:40:32,049
There's a penis?

7355
07:40:32,049 --> 07:40:34,049
Oh no there's not.

7356
07:40:34,049 --> 07:40:36,290
Fucking god damn it. Don't even say that.

7357
07:40:36,290 --> 07:40:40,580
Where?

7358
07:40:40,580 --> 07:40:51,119
You see how easy this is?

7359
07:40:51,119 --> 07:40:53,119
I can't fucking link shit anymore.

7360
07:40:53,119 --> 07:40:55,299
I know. Okay.

7361
07:40:55,299 --> 07:40:57,299
There is it. There is it. But like hey link

7362
07:40:57,299 --> 07:40:59,299
link. Hey hey there it is.

7363
07:40:59,299 --> 07:41:01,299
Oh link this place. Yeah sure.

7364
07:41:01,299 --> 07:41:05,779
I gotta fucking have a screening process.

7365
07:41:05,779 --> 07:41:13,139
But thank you Garfield.

7366
07:41:13,139 --> 07:41:15,549
That's wonderful. You can try.

7367
07:41:15,549 --> 07:41:17,549
I can trust Garfield. I can.

7368
07:41:17,549 --> 07:41:20,500
KXZ 501 10 bucks.

7369
07:41:20,500 --> 07:41:23,569
They say victory bits. Thank you.

7370
07:41:23,569 --> 07:41:26,450
Thank you KXZ. For the 10

7371
07:41:26,450 --> 07:41:29,709
dollars. Much love to you.

7372
07:41:29,709 --> 07:41:32,779
Garfield we trust the Flintstones.

7373
07:41:32,779 --> 07:41:34,959
We don't.

7374
07:41:34,959 --> 07:41:36,959
That was awful.

7375
07:41:36,959 --> 07:41:38,959
Oh I have nightmares about

7376
07:41:38,959 --> 07:41:43,819
that scenario.

7377
07:41:43,819 --> 07:41:53,869
That was so fucked up.

7378
07:41:53,869 --> 07:41:55,869
We don't even talk. We don't have to talk about it.

7379
07:41:55,869 --> 07:41:59,069
We're going to bury that. Tingy thanks for the 250.

7380
07:41:59,069 --> 07:42:01,069
Oh no I dropped some money.

7381
07:42:01,069 --> 07:42:03,069
Sherp. Oh fuck oh no. The vacuum

7382
07:42:03,069 --> 07:42:05,069
sucked up my bits. Sometimes.

7383
07:42:05,069 --> 07:42:10,450
Hey Silverflame. Thanks for the

7384
07:42:10,450 --> 07:42:12,450
two dollars and fifty cents. Hey Jerma Sally. I'm not

7385
07:42:12,450 --> 07:42:14,450
part of the mafia and can't donate

7386
07:42:14,450 --> 07:42:16,450
hundreds of dollars. But here's some money.

7387
07:42:16,450 --> 07:42:18,450
Thank you regardless.

7388
07:42:18,450 --> 07:42:20,450
Anywho. Today is my birthday. Getting drunk

7389
07:42:20,450 --> 07:42:22,450
and watching your streams is a great way to spend it.

7390
07:42:22,450 --> 07:42:24,450
You're my favorite entertainer in the world bro.

7391
07:42:24,450 --> 07:42:26,450
Keep doing what you're doing because both me and hundreds

7392
07:42:26,450 --> 07:42:28,450
of others love it. And you

7393
07:42:28,450 --> 07:42:32,349
smooches. Bye.

7394
07:42:32,349 --> 07:42:34,349
I hope you enjoyed yourself. Hope you enjoyed your night.

7395
07:42:34,349 --> 07:42:37,419
Happy birthday. Hope you didn't drink

7396
07:42:37,419 --> 07:42:41,200
too much. It's always

7397
07:42:41,200 --> 07:42:44,209
nice to kick back a few and hang

7398
07:42:44,209 --> 07:42:46,209
out and watch some streams. Or

7399
07:42:46,209 --> 07:42:48,209
stream. You know I drink on stream sometimes.

7400
07:42:48,209 --> 07:42:50,209
You've seen it.

7401
07:42:50,209 --> 07:42:58,400
There's dozens of us out here.

7402
07:42:58,400 --> 07:43:01,599
You got drunk on cooking wine.

7403
07:43:01,599 --> 07:43:03,599
Yeah. Cause I wanted to drink it.

7404
07:43:03,599 --> 07:43:09,419
Thank you masked hero

7405
07:43:09,419 --> 07:43:11,419
man for the three dollars. The other day

7406
07:43:11,419 --> 07:43:13,419
I sent you this video. I forgot to mention how long it

7407
07:43:13,419 --> 07:43:15,729
was. But I have the part

7408
07:43:15,729 --> 07:43:17,729
I actually wanted you to see here. Hopefully

7409
07:43:17,729 --> 07:43:19,729
you like it. It's a lot shorter since 21

7410
07:43:19,729 --> 07:43:21,729
minutes of 2D movie maker.

7411
07:43:21,729 --> 07:43:23,900
It's hard to stomach.

7412
07:43:23,900 --> 07:43:41,790
Let's see.

7413
07:43:41,790 --> 07:43:43,790
No this is not going to play is it?

7414
07:43:43,790 --> 07:43:45,790
Because I have this connected to my

7415
07:43:45,790 --> 07:43:50,080
Can you guys hear this? I can't.

7416
07:43:50,080 --> 07:43:52,080
I'm through

7417
07:43:52,080 --> 07:43:55,409
my Playstation 2 right now.

7418
07:43:55,409 --> 07:44:03,090
Let's see if I can hear this.

7419
07:44:03,090 --> 07:44:09,490
Can I hear this? What was it

7420
07:44:09,490 --> 07:44:11,490
Oh.

7421
07:44:11,490 --> 07:44:13,490
A slice of deep space. Moon fighting.

7422
07:44:13,490 --> 07:44:21,229
We all

7423
07:44:21,229 --> 07:44:23,229
want to see me turn into a

7424
07:44:23,229 --> 07:44:25,229
super saiyan.

7425
07:44:25,229 --> 07:44:27,229
Turn into a what?

7426
07:44:31,229 --> 07:44:36,740
Now it looks like

7427
07:44:36,740 --> 07:44:38,740
I'm a super saiyan again.

7428
07:44:38,740 --> 07:44:40,740
There's no visual.

7429
07:44:40,740 --> 07:44:42,740
Yeah well you guys have to figure out what's going on.

7430
07:44:42,740 --> 07:44:44,740
I have to bring out this power.

7431
07:44:44,740 --> 07:44:46,740
But you killed

7432
07:44:46,740 --> 07:44:48,740
Fleurgey. And I can't

7433
07:44:48,740 --> 07:44:50,740
be dealing with that.

7434
07:44:50,740 --> 07:44:52,740
Oh shut up.

7435
07:44:57,040 --> 07:44:59,919
I think that's pretty well done.

7436
07:44:59,919 --> 07:45:01,919
He's too strong.

7437
07:45:01,919 --> 07:45:03,919
But I have to beat him for Fleurgey.

7438
07:45:05,919 --> 07:45:07,919
Who's Fleurgey?

7439
07:45:11,759 --> 07:45:13,759
Time for you to taste my

7440
07:45:13,759 --> 07:45:15,759
final punch.

7441
07:45:15,759 --> 07:45:17,759
Big

7442
07:45:17,759 --> 07:45:19,759
Bastard

7443
07:45:19,759 --> 07:45:21,759
Oh hey that's kind of scary.

7444
07:45:21,759 --> 07:45:23,759
One punch.

7445
07:45:39,250 --> 07:45:41,250
Hey that was fucking crazy.

7446
07:45:41,250 --> 07:45:45,020
That was a fight on the moon.

7447
07:45:45,020 --> 07:45:47,840
Somebody said they were too high for this.

7448
07:45:47,840 --> 07:45:56,610
Relax don't worry.

7449
07:45:56,610 --> 07:45:58,610
The music's from One Punch Man. Yeah it is.

7450
07:45:58,610 --> 07:46:04,049
Well this makes much more sense.

7451
07:46:09,549 --> 07:46:11,790
Thank you Masterman

7452
07:46:11,790 --> 07:46:15,700
for your 3D

7453
07:46:15,700 --> 07:46:17,700
movie maker animation.

7454
07:46:17,700 --> 07:46:19,939
Sorry for making you watch that.

7455
07:46:19,939 --> 07:46:24,419
Why what? No it's fine.

7456
07:46:24,419 --> 07:46:26,419
Some of those animations are really

7457
07:46:26,419 --> 07:46:28,419
some of that shit takes a long fucking time in this program.

7458
07:46:28,419 --> 07:46:32,770
Which you guys don't understand.

7459
07:46:32,770 --> 07:46:34,770
Some of those like explosions and

7460
07:46:34,770 --> 07:46:36,770
hand beams.

7461
07:46:36,770 --> 07:46:38,770
That's a lot of processing power for

7462
07:46:38,770 --> 07:46:42,419
Windows 95 to handle.

7463
07:46:42,419 --> 07:46:46,959
But thank you Masterman.

7464
07:46:46,959 --> 07:46:48,959
And just the frame by frame that you have to do to make that

7465
07:46:48,959 --> 07:46:50,959
with like balls and sticks.

7466
07:46:50,959 --> 07:46:57,169
It's hard to do. Hey Jess you got it

7467
07:46:57,169 --> 07:46:59,169
thanks for the 250. Here's to fund your lucky charms.

7468
07:46:59,169 --> 07:47:01,169
I'd eat that too if I wasn't too lazy to put in the time

7469
07:47:01,169 --> 07:47:03,169
it takes to pick out all the marshmallows.

7470
07:47:03,169 --> 07:47:08,849
I got you.

7471
07:47:08,849 --> 07:47:10,849
Somebody in chat actually was like really upset.

7472
07:47:10,849 --> 07:47:13,599
And I kind of felt bad. They were just like why would you do

7473
07:47:13,599 --> 07:47:16,159
that? Like what the fuck is wrong

7474
07:47:16,159 --> 07:47:18,159
with you? What a waste of food.

7475
07:47:18,159 --> 07:47:20,159
Are you really that fucked up?

7476
07:47:20,159 --> 07:47:27,389
It was me.

7477
07:47:27,389 --> 07:47:34,430
Why would you do that?

7478
07:47:34,430 --> 07:47:39,419
I agree with that guy. Yeah I know.

7479
07:47:39,419 --> 07:47:43,459
But thank you Jess you got it.

7480
07:47:43,459 --> 07:47:45,459
VR Josh thanks for the 250. Jerma here's

7481
07:47:45,459 --> 07:47:47,459
some money to go toward your insulin

7482
07:47:47,459 --> 07:47:49,459
fund once you get diagnosed with diabetes after

7483
07:47:49,459 --> 07:47:51,459
eating balls of sugar for breakfast lunch

7484
07:47:51,459 --> 07:47:53,459
and dinner. Only breakfast and dinner.

7485
07:47:53,459 --> 07:47:55,459
But it makes me brush my teeth. I'm going to have real clean teeth.

7486
07:47:55,459 --> 07:47:58,340
Thank you for the 250.

7487
07:47:58,340 --> 07:48:04,099
Asbestos

7488
07:48:04,099 --> 07:48:06,099
Flask thanks for the four dollars

7489
07:48:06,099 --> 07:48:08,099
and two cents. Hope you have a six man

7490
07:48:08,099 --> 07:48:10,099
condiment battle

7491
07:48:10,099 --> 07:48:12,099
next rumble.

7492
07:48:12,099 --> 07:48:18,610
Why?

7493
07:48:18,610 --> 07:48:20,610
Because we talked about drinking condiments for

7494
07:48:20,610 --> 07:48:23,549
30 seconds. Hey

7495
07:48:23,549 --> 07:48:25,549
Sad Vega thanks for the 250. It was 10 58

7496
07:48:25,549 --> 07:48:27,549
p.m. Nevada time. We already talked

7497
07:48:27,549 --> 07:48:29,549
about it. We're going on UTC plus 8.

7498
07:48:29,549 --> 07:48:32,180
Thank you for the 250 though Sad Vega.

7499
07:48:32,180 --> 07:48:34,180
Pika Banana thanks for the 250.

7500
07:48:34,180 --> 07:48:36,180
Fun stream as always. Thanks for watching.

7501
07:48:36,180 --> 07:48:40,459
I'm going to get the credits rolling here.

7502
07:48:40,459 --> 07:48:43,729
They're probably going to go pretty fast.

7503
07:48:43,729 --> 07:48:45,900
Because there was a shitload of community subs

7504
07:48:45,900 --> 07:48:48,139
tonight. There were

7505
07:48:48,139 --> 07:48:50,139
I think like four or five

7506
07:48:50,139 --> 07:48:52,139
hundred almost community subs.

7507
07:48:52,139 --> 07:48:54,139
Which is insane.

7508
07:48:54,139 --> 07:48:57,979
Look at that.

7509
07:48:57,979 --> 07:49:02,139
Can't even see them go by.

7510
07:49:02,139 --> 07:49:04,139
That's high speed subs.

7511
07:49:04,139 --> 07:49:12,209
Thank you everybody that subbed and resubbed

7512
07:49:12,209 --> 07:49:14,209
all the community subs you guys.

7513
07:49:14,209 --> 07:49:16,580
You guys are too much. Thank you.

7514
07:49:16,580 --> 07:49:19,389
And while we see this extreme

7515
07:49:19,389 --> 07:49:21,389
amount of people that have subscribed to the channel tonight.

7516
07:49:21,389 --> 07:49:23,759
Remember when you used to read these?

7517
07:49:23,759 --> 07:49:27,279
Yeah I do.

7518
07:49:27,279 --> 07:49:36,349
Oh my god.

7519
07:49:36,349 --> 07:49:38,720
That's insane. Try and read them now?

7520
07:49:38,720 --> 07:49:40,720
Okay. Back on the agreement? No.

7521
07:49:40,720 --> 07:49:43,860
Impossible. Not possible.

7522
07:49:43,860 --> 07:49:51,979
Hey Zshpey thanks right

7523
07:49:51,979 --> 07:49:54,669
at the end. Thank you for the 10 dollars Zshpey.

7524
07:49:54,669 --> 07:49:56,669
Hello Jeremy. Just reminding

7525
07:49:56,669 --> 07:49:58,669
just a reminder to try

7526
07:49:58,669 --> 07:50:02,900
in and out since you're on the west coast.

7527
07:50:02,900 --> 07:50:04,900
I've had in and out a few times.

7528
07:50:04,900 --> 07:50:06,900
Also I'm craving some skate

7529
07:50:06,900 --> 07:50:08,900
from you in the future hopefully.

7530
07:50:08,900 --> 07:50:14,700
It's probably not going to happen. For your

7531
07:50:14,700 --> 07:50:16,700
fitness comments one way to get in good shape is to find a

7532
07:50:16,700 --> 07:50:18,700
really fun active hobby like rock climbing.

7533
07:50:18,700 --> 07:50:21,709
That's true. That is true.

7534
07:50:21,709 --> 07:50:30,419
Getting a hobby that makes you move around

7535
07:50:30,419 --> 07:50:32,909
is good for you if you can get

7536
07:50:32,909 --> 07:50:35,470
into something. Absolutely.

7537
07:50:35,470 --> 07:50:43,069
But yeah I've had in and out.

7538
07:50:43,069 --> 07:50:49,090
It is good. It is a good

7539
07:50:49,090 --> 07:50:51,090
little joint to get a quick berg.

7540
07:50:51,090 --> 07:50:53,389
I will say.

7541
07:50:53,389 --> 07:50:55,389
The subs are still going that fast.

7542
07:50:55,389 --> 07:50:57,389
How many subs is it total?

7543
07:50:57,389 --> 07:51:01,490
752 subs

7544
07:51:01,490 --> 07:51:06,540
this stream. Total.

7545
07:51:06,540 --> 07:51:09,680
Let me see what I have. Okay.

7546
07:51:09,680 --> 07:51:18,060
Oh my god. Yeah because

7547
07:51:18,060 --> 07:51:20,060
I was at 40

7548
07:51:20,060 --> 07:51:22,060
I was at like 4900 subs.

7549
07:51:22,060 --> 07:51:25,200
Like a 2 days ago or something.

7550
07:51:25,200 --> 07:51:27,200
Or 5100 or 4900 or something.

7551
07:51:27,200 --> 07:51:33,470
Holy shit. Yeah.

7552
07:51:33,470 --> 07:51:36,669
I'm

7553
07:51:36,669 --> 07:51:38,669
1 trillion emotes unlocked.

7554
07:51:38,669 --> 07:51:43,340
49? No.

7555
07:51:43,340 --> 07:51:48,139
4900.

7556
07:51:48,139 --> 07:51:58,639
Not 49000.

7557
07:51:58,639 --> 07:52:05,099
That's fucking crazy.

7558
07:52:05,099 --> 07:52:07,099
If you guys remember from

7559
07:52:07,099 --> 07:52:09,099
like 3 or 4 months ago

7560
07:52:09,099 --> 07:52:11,099
I think we crossed 7000 subs

7561
07:52:11,099 --> 07:52:14,560
from a bunch of gifted subs

7562
07:52:14,560 --> 07:52:16,560
and a bunch of like sub trains.

7563
07:52:16,560 --> 07:52:21,680
And I was at 4900

7564
07:52:21,680 --> 07:52:28,060
last week.

7565
07:52:28,060 --> 07:52:30,060
Yeah there was a point where

7566
07:52:30,060 --> 07:52:32,060
it came down but

7567
07:52:32,060 --> 07:52:34,060
I was up at fucking 7

7568
07:52:34,060 --> 07:52:36,060
damn thousand subs.

7569
07:52:36,060 --> 07:52:38,060
At least for a little while. It was there for a while.

7570
07:52:38,060 --> 07:52:51,569
Absolutely fucking insane.

7571
07:52:51,569 --> 07:52:55,020
Thank you everybody.

7572
07:52:55,020 --> 07:52:57,970
Still a couple more bits to do.

7573
07:52:57,970 --> 07:52:59,970
But that was

7574
07:52:59,970 --> 07:53:02,459
for the 10 bucks.

7575
07:53:02,459 --> 07:53:06,240
Talking about internet.

7576
07:53:06,240 --> 07:53:08,240
Hey Jermbo I've been super sick

7577
07:53:08,240 --> 07:53:10,240
for a while now on your VODs plus this stream

7578
07:53:10,240 --> 07:53:12,240
has been keeping me alive.

7579
07:53:12,240 --> 07:53:14,240
Anyway here's a quick interesting question for you.

7580
07:53:14,240 --> 07:53:16,669
What's the scariest oh shit this is

7581
07:53:16,669 --> 07:53:18,669
going to get my channel banned moment you've had on

7582
07:53:18,669 --> 07:53:20,669
the stream. Keep up the good work.

7583
07:53:20,669 --> 07:53:24,900
The Flintstones thing.

7584
07:53:24,900 --> 07:53:32,380
Definitely. Cause that was like actual

7585
07:53:32,380 --> 07:53:34,380
like weird fucked up

7586
07:53:34,380 --> 07:53:36,380
porn that like I linked to.

7587
07:53:36,380 --> 07:53:40,669
So it wasn't on the stream but

7588
07:53:40,669 --> 07:53:42,669
I like linked to a page

7589
07:53:42,669 --> 07:53:52,659
that had it on there. So

7590
07:53:52,659 --> 07:53:56,939
it definitely was that. When did this happen?

7591
07:53:56,939 --> 07:53:58,939
I don't know like a year or two ago?

7592
07:53:58,939 --> 07:54:00,939
When was that? That was like a year ago.

7593
07:54:00,939 --> 07:54:02,939
It was from some yeah it was from like a wiki page.

7594
07:54:02,939 --> 07:54:04,939
Like a McDonald's wiki character

7595
07:54:04,939 --> 07:54:15,950
page. When was this?

7596
07:54:15,950 --> 07:54:17,950
It was during Red Dead 1. That was a long time ago.

7597
07:54:17,950 --> 07:54:22,500
It was like more than a year ago.

7598
07:54:22,500 --> 07:54:24,500
But thank you Sergio. But we

7599
07:54:24,500 --> 07:54:26,500
were just talking about it.

7600
07:54:26,500 --> 07:54:29,819
Jermbo lied about 5k subs

7601
07:54:29,819 --> 07:54:31,819
thanks to the 250. I would have a sub if you didn't

7602
07:54:31,819 --> 07:54:33,819
lie. It was April Fools if I was just kidding.

7603
07:54:33,819 --> 07:54:35,819
It was just an extreme

7604
07:54:35,819 --> 07:54:37,819
crazy thing that I said that didn't mean anything.

7605
07:54:37,819 --> 07:54:50,349
Cause it was April Fools.

7606
07:54:50,349 --> 07:54:54,000
Why is it? Why does that LUL

7607
07:54:54,000 --> 07:54:58,479
look different?

7608
07:54:58,479 --> 07:55:00,479
This LUL there's two LULs

7609
07:55:00,479 --> 07:55:06,180
one looks like weird.

7610
07:55:06,180 --> 07:55:08,349
Oh that's okay.

7611
07:55:08,349 --> 07:55:10,349
That's the B. That's the BTTV one.

7612
07:55:10,349 --> 07:55:12,349
I was like did they change that right now

7613
07:55:12,349 --> 07:55:14,349
or something? That's the old one right? Okay.

7614
07:55:14,349 --> 07:55:24,450
I see.

7615
07:55:24,450 --> 07:55:26,450
I have better TwitchTV now so I can see it.

7616
07:55:26,450 --> 07:55:28,450
And hey Sweenex

7617
07:55:28,450 --> 07:55:30,450
thank you Sweenex for the 10 bucks. Hey Jerm

7618
07:55:30,450 --> 07:55:32,450
made an actual. I made an actual Jex

7619
07:55:32,450 --> 07:55:34,450
mix cereal box if you want to check it out. Feel free

7620
07:55:34,450 --> 07:55:36,689
to show it.

7621
07:55:36,689 --> 07:55:39,180
New

7622
07:55:39,180 --> 07:55:41,180
bald coin marshmallows.

7623
07:55:41,180 --> 07:55:50,700
That's funny.

7624
07:55:50,700 --> 07:55:52,700
There's a dick on there. I see a dick.

7625
07:55:52,700 --> 07:56:01,900
Right? But no thank you.

7626
07:56:01,900 --> 07:56:10,740
This is fucking awesome. Thank you so much

7627
07:56:10,740 --> 07:56:16,880
Sweenex. I did not put

7628
07:56:16,880 --> 07:56:18,880
I'm just referencing

7629
07:56:18,880 --> 07:56:20,880
what somebody else said earlier.

7630
07:56:20,880 --> 07:56:23,060
But that's going to be it guys.

7631
07:56:23,060 --> 07:56:25,060
I'll see you guys in

7632
07:56:25,060 --> 07:56:27,060
two days. I'll see you guys on Tuesday.

7633
07:56:27,060 --> 07:56:29,060
We will continue Monster Rancher 4.

7634
07:56:29,060 --> 07:56:31,360
And depending on how much we go there

7635
07:56:31,360 --> 07:56:33,360
we might just keep going. I don't know.

7636
07:56:33,360 --> 07:56:35,360
I'm into it though. I think it's fun. I think it's

7637
07:56:35,360 --> 07:56:37,360
interesting and I want to at least get to a point where we can

7638
07:56:37,360 --> 07:56:40,110
do some people together.

7639
07:56:40,110 --> 07:56:42,110
Special thanks to Joel.

7640
07:56:42,110 --> 07:56:44,110
Everybody that came over from

7641
07:56:44,110 --> 07:56:46,110
Joel's channel. Thanks for the raid.

7642
07:56:46,110 --> 07:56:48,990
See you guys real soon.

7643
07:56:48,990 --> 07:56:53,409
Be careful tonight

7644
07:56:53,409 --> 07:56:55,409
and tomorrow because people are going to be saying all kinds

7645
07:56:55,409 --> 07:56:57,650
of weird fucked up shit.

7646
07:56:57,650 --> 07:56:59,650
Like I wanted to give you guys an example before

7647
07:56:59,650 --> 07:57:01,650
to prepare you for it. I'm going to give

7648
07:57:01,650 --> 07:57:03,650
5,000 community subs.

7649
07:57:03,650 --> 07:57:05,650
You got to be prepared for that. I got you

7650
07:57:05,650 --> 07:57:13,779
with that one so you're ready for it.

7651
07:57:13,779 --> 07:57:15,779
But have a great night.

7652
07:57:15,779 --> 07:57:18,080
See you guys real soon. Take care of yourselves.

7653
07:57:18,080 --> 07:57:22,860
Have a good one.

7654
07:58:00,009 --> 07:58:02,009
Favorite species of sea creature?

7655
07:58:02,009 --> 07:58:04,009
Sea horse.

7656
07:58:04,009 --> 07:58:09,580
Do I have any pre-stream or post-stream rituals?

7657
07:58:09,580 --> 07:58:11,580
Pre-stream, coffee, pulse stream, bath.

7658
07:58:11,580 --> 07:58:16,950
Favorite album?

07:58:16,950 --> 07:58:18,950
Demon Days by The Grylls.

7660
07:58:18,950 --> 07:58:25,419
Can you make some cat noises? Yeah, sure.

7661
07:58:25,419 --> 07:58:35,720
Least favorite food?

7662
07:58:35,720 --> 07:58:37,720
Uh...

7663
07:58:37,720 --> 07:58:39,720
I don't like soy sauce.

7664
07:58:39,720 --> 07:58:49,580
That thing's with soy sauce on it.

7665
07:58:49,580 --> 07:58:51,580
Is General Grieve going to be a German rumble? No.

7666
07:58:51,580 --> 07:58:57,080
What's the worst fruit?

7667
07:58:57,080 --> 07:58:59,259
Uh...

7668
07:58:59,259 --> 07:59:01,259
Like papaya or something. I don't eat it.

7669
07:59:01,259 --> 07:59:11,689
Fattest animal you can think of?

7670
07:59:11,689 --> 07:59:13,689
An elephant.

7671
07:59:13,689 --> 07:59:21,369
That's 8 hours. See you guys later.

7672
07:59:21,369 --> 07:59:23,369
Do you listen to Vinny's CDs?

7673
07:59:23,369 --> 07:59:25,369
Funny thing about Vinny's CDs,

7674
07:59:25,369 --> 07:59:29,340
it's going in.

7675
07:59:29,340 --> 07:59:31,340
We're going to get a monster out of Redbox.

7676
07:59:31,340 --> 07:59:33,700
It's literally sitting right here next to me.

7677
07:59:33,700 --> 07:59:41,450
So, yeah, that's

7678
07:59:41,450 --> 07:59:44,840
right here. That's it.

7679
07:59:44,840 --> 07:59:47,459
I will see you

07:59:47,459 --> 07:59:49,459
on Tuesday.

7681
07:59:49,459 --> 07:59:52,709
Have a great one, guys.

7682
07:59:52,709 --> 07:59:54,709
Happy April Fool's.

7683
07:59:54,709 --> 08:00:15,369
See you soon.
