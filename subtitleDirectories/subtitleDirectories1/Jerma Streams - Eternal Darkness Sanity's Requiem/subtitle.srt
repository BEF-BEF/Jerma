1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:10,330
Good... Oh, I can't say good morning. I have to say good afternoon. Sure of my might. Yeah,

2
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:18,230
start a little bit an hour later today than usual. Stuff to do this morning. But I've completed all

3
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:28,390
of my tasks and I'm ready to play a video game. In front of all of you. Today, we're gonna be

4
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:35,429
playing Eternal Darkness. Ssssssadities. I've not... Let's... Let's stop for... Let's hold on a second.

5
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:43,929
Hadn't even been one, two full minutes. I'm just gonna... We're not gonna do that yet. I promised my

6
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:49,909
mother that I would at least be cordial and I wouldn't be like a weirdo for the first 40

7
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:56,939
minutes of the stream today. Sorry, Mom. Alright, turn to Dr. Synodys Requiem. This game came out

8
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:07,030
for GameCube. GameCube Classic. This game, uh, fucks with you while you play it. It's by Silicon Knights.

9
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,829
You might know them as the people that sued, uh, Unreal Engine and they lost.

10
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:21,099
Unfortunately, that's like the biggest thing they've done. Which is sad because this game is

11
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:27,900
really good and I'm actually one of the weirdos that liked Two Human. I liked that game. I thought

12
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,620
Two Human was good. That was the last real video game they worked on and then they had all this

13
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:42,489
legal problems and then they stopped. Two Human was good. I liked it. Me and my brother used to

14
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:48,870
sit there and play Two Human like three or four hours a day. Now, granted that only lasted maybe

15
00:01:50,060 --> 00:02:02,790
a couple of weeks, but if we still had fun, you're Two Human. Hold on. I have a question.

16
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:09,110
Hey, how is me? Alright, this is important. How is me telling you a story about how me and my

17
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:18,460
brother played Two Human? A minus two joke or a plus two joke for that matter. That doesn't make

18
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,740
any sense. You know, my fond memories of me and my brother playing Two Human on the couch.

19
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:36,939
That wasn't very funny. That was really funny. Oh, you got an emote? Wait, you got an emote.

20
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:46,490
Only visible to you. You got an emote today. Thanks to EX Theo's subscription. Thank him?

21
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:54,580
Hold on. I can say thank you. What does that do? Thanks for the hyper slam. Hold on. How does this

22
00:02:54,580 --> 00:03:08,419
work? Okay, I just hit enter. I don't know what I did. I just apparently thanked that person.

23
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:22,250
Hey, thanks. Thank me instead. I don't think I've seen that before. Alright, this is Eternal

24
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,620
Darkness. Let's move over to the streaming screen so you can see what's going on here.

25
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:41,349
Are we kind of loud? But it's okay. I will turn it down for you. I'm ready to play. I have played

26
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:47,110
this game before. It was about 20 years ago as you see 2002. So it's been a while, but I want to

27
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:53,539
relive it. Audio not synced up. There's no audio to sync up. What are you talking about?

28
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:00,979
Dude, audio is not even synced up. Let's test.

29
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,759
Fuck, I just turned into the demo at Radio Shack where you go in and you press the buttons on the

30
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:27,750
keyboard. You press like 014 and then start hitting keys. It's fine. We're good. Radio Shack isn't

31
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:40,730
real. Did they go bankrupt? This wretched book is where it all began so long ago.

32
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:53,300
Ace Camp today? No, not today. I love Roivas. It's a great tea. Oh, he's dead.

33
00:04:53,540 --> 00:05:00,250
This is not my story, nor even the story of the Roivas family. It is the story of humanity.

34
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,620
Your perceptions will not change reality, but simply color it.

35
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,540
Humanity has been on the edge of extinction for two millennia,

36
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:23,579
ignorant of so much and dependent on so few. This is a scary game. This is not a scary game.

37
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:56,379
Let me correct you. What's going on? It just went purple. All right. Shit. Oh, come on.

38
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:13,939
Don't do this to me. No, no. Stop outing me. Is it emulated? I had to, okay, because I have the game.

39
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:28,019
I have the disk and it wouldn't capture through my fucking capture card. We're going to get like

40
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:49,819
purple flashes, aren't we? No, the disk. I've already shown it. Pick up the phone. We're going

41
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:56,439
to get purple. Should I put like a warning that says like, hey, intermediate purple flashing?

42
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:13,560
Of course, it could be perfect. Yeah. Who's this? This is inspector. I'll be on the next flight out.

43
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:18,500
Looks pretty good though. Could have used the Wii for this. I did.

44
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:21,139
Here's what happened when I went through the Wii.

45
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:30,939
It's because of the capture card. I don't know why it's doing it. It's fucked up for some reason.

46
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:37,819
I trust you had a pleasant trip. Yes, I suppose so considering. Yes. My condolences. This

47
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:44,939
most unpleasant. It's a shame we couldn't meet under brighter circumstances. Yes, it is. Can we

48
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:49,660
get this over with please? Of course this way. Oh, it's only going to happen when we change to a

49
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:55,899
different chapter. Not a pleasant sight. Oh shit. Okay. That's not that bad. I'm afraid there's

50
00:07:55,899 --> 00:08:10,680
not much to see. Disable what? What should I disable? Disable store XFB. All right,

51
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,720
where the fuck is that? How do I store XFB?

52
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:26,649
Store XFB to texture only. To avoid this.

53
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:42,100
I already know what happens. Her grandfather was Edgar Allan Poe and like he wrote The Raven here

54
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:46,500
and then the place is cursed. I don't what that's who cares. There's no head. Now none of this

55
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,620
makes sense. There's no sign of intrusion and there was certainly a lot of force used here.

56
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,289
I have never seen anything like this in my 20 years on the force.

57
00:08:56,169 --> 00:09:00,570
We have no evidence except for the body and what's left doesn't say much.

58
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,169
We don't have a single clue. When I go on my I'll turn I'll change it.

59
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:07,929
I feel like that's probably somewhere easy to find in the

60
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:13,610
until you do go into the registry edit hold on a minute I don't want to do that in the

61
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:24,759
middle of the stream I want answers so do I I wish I had some two weeks later purple flash

62
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:37,929
incoming no we're good turn on real xfb or after okay real xfb talked by her grandfather's mysterious

63
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:43,370
death and frustrated the incompetence of the local police alex vows to uncover the truth

64
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:49,610
she decides to search the mansion the place where edward al ad edward edward ed squidward

65
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:56,440
alan poe conducted his research if there was a tie to his past and possibly a tie to his murder

66
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:05,929
we'll be here welcome to eternal darkness sanity's end okay we got to search there's a punch game

67
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:14,700
already has plus one letter grade what do I think about vr salmon max kind of cool I guess

68
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:26,019
really is kind of like resident evil huh uh this is a sword with something I can

69
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,200
oh scary whispers a wooden plaque is fastened to the door taking the place of the lock

70
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,659
colored sigil is carved into the wood above a wide slot the slot is just wide enough to insert

71
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:42,779
a narrow blade I need a sword to open this probably if I remember how do I run is there a run

72
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:52,460
yeah it doesn't run okay but what about house flipper vr I mean that's kind of cool but I

73
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:57,049
feel like I already know what that's gonna be like I feel like I've already played that for

74
00:10:57,049 --> 00:11:08,649
some reason I don't know why I haven't played piano the grand pianist dancer awaiting the hands

75
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:14,330
of a decent musician unfortunately edward never really lived up to that description and as such

76
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:21,620
the piano fell into disuse I wish I could just sit down and just do like a Mozart piece right now

77
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:29,259
you know I really think I wish you know how games have mini games that you said you like oh wow

78
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:33,419
this is a cool little feature for many why how come this has never been a full piano that you

79
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:39,019
control with left stick and like uh the two bumpers on the left side and right stick for

80
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:45,110
your right hand for the right trigger and right bumper that'd be so much fun if you just I don't

81
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:51,210
know why no one's done that it's so easy happens in half-life alex thanks for the spoiler hey thanks

82
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:55,210
for spoiling the entire series of a half-life alex to me there's a piano you can play thank you

83
00:11:55,769 --> 00:12:02,700
the illustration features a collection of strange line designs related to each other in a cyclical

84
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,379
manner there's some significance to it but it's particularly evident it isn't particularly

85
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:16,519
evident okay I gotta find the secrets all right so what at what point does my screen turn off in

86
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:20,360
like the like the kojima of like hideo blinks in the top right corner doesn't that happen in this

87
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:34,070
game walk a beautiful carriage clock the hands appear to be stuck and the clock continues to

88
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:40,889
tick with the time permanently set to 3 33 there is a key in the back of the clock presumably for

89
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:47,980
winding it wind the key yes alex picks up the desk clock and pulls the key from it however there's

90
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:53,100
something odd about the key it isn't for a winding at all it looks like a dresser key

91
00:12:53,100 --> 00:13:11,820
nice all right open a bedroom we're gonna find bedroom bedroom one portraits of the ancestral

92
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:18,700
roivas line the foyer walls their faces reveal a dark brooding edge there's something about

93
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:24,789
each one that gives the viewer an unsettling feeling this is the luigi's mansion house

94
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:34,490
I mean it's every horror movie mansion is the exact same they all are the resident evil house

95
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:43,690
they all have this gigantic red carpet bullshit that goes up two big flights of stairs that are

96
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:49,240
parallel to each other and then there's two rooms on the left and two rooms on the right

97
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,909
and one all yeah one all the way down in the hallway this is how every single the horror

98
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:59,690
movie mansion is it doesn't matter what game doesn't matter what movie all exactly the same

99
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:16,039
it's identical doors locked oh I gotta go to the dresser what a worthless hallway by the way

100
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:23,909
this is four why not just end the wall there save yourself like fucking five grand on new building

101
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:35,779

building costs yeah I don't know what that was what what does that mean new building costs huh

103
00:14:43,929 --> 00:15:02,379
that was just a bad translation I was trying to say a redone kitchen the warm glow of the candle

104
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:08,740
light the roivas family tree hangs from the wall shadows flitter across its surface obscuring the

105
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:15,100
detail if one looks closely the family secrets are revealed we'll look closely oh where's the

106

okay it's time for me to be up front with you I don't want to lie I have to tell you the truth

111
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:25,909
I've looked at chat more time than I've looked at the screen with the game on it I swear to god

112
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:30,070
I've just been hanging out with you guys just looking at chat I haven't even played okay so

117
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:14,619
it go into the four corners of the screen 10 times in the last one second that's impossible

118
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:28,700
hey dude you calibrations wrong uh no it isn't that this set this time to 333 this looming

119
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,339
grandfather clock seems to stand ominously in the corner gazing on this empty room with an almost

120
00:17:33,339 --> 00:18:10,390
patriarchal layer 333 yep the secret study don't touch that purple screen fix coming through

121
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:21,930
germawalk hold on a minute this is important oh man that I cannot can I like is that does that

122
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:31,339

125
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:54,230
let me get to a save point first again there's gonna be a purple flash by the way I have to

126
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,430
warn everybody there's a purple flash that happens like when we change chapters and then I'm gonna

127
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:01,990
save the game and then bang I'm gonna go turn that off okay so just I really am warning that's not

128
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:08,059
like a joke I'm not fucking around like seriously it's bad a large leather bounty antique book open

129
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:33,349
it and it opened to 16 by 10 resolution nor did I care the knowledge changed me have to do a

130
00:19:33,349 --> 00:19:38,789
while reference will also change you every single strength as you read this oh you will come to

131
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:45,180
learn hold on I'm talking over the cutscene you too will come to understand this is her voice

132
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:52,759
talking or you will perish she's reading the book purple be careful purple I'm serious that once I

133
00:19:52,759 --> 00:20:00,680
could not see beyond the veil of our reality to see those who dwell behind no that's bullshit

134
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:07,640
dude nobody reads a book in their own voice for I have learned the frailty of flesh that would be

135
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,960
strange why would you give every character your voice one fucking purple I told you sorry it's I

136
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:20,089
told you it's coming I hope I warned you long enough here is queer scandalous there is cons of

137
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:23,130
can you imagine reading a book in your voice

138
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,079
yes

139
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:47,240
read books in your own voice do you believe that it really exists centurion I do not doubt our

140
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:53,079
emperor's beliefs or his orders what but if we are to retrieve the artifact hold on a minute

141
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:58,440
and we must be strong and patient so when it when a character talks in a book you don't hear

00:40:33,619 --> 00:40:49,820
minus two or xfb copies to texture store efb copies to texture like it's xfb right it's so

244
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:57,059
the efb was wrong I have the old version this I have the new version of I have the new version

295
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:44,420
use your special book this is the tome of eternal darkness with spells whatever I'm gonna go should

296
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:48,500
I go back I'm gonna think I'm gonna go into the library where's the library again I read that

297
00:51:49,059 --> 00:52:11,559
put in here do an antelope now I don't I don't know what an antelope sounds like I have no clue

298
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:18,300
all right what did I miss something in here some kind of mask faces serenity and composure

299
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:29,420
oh cool strangely with the tome of eternal darkness in her possession Alex can read the

300
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:35,590
page it is a chapter page from the tome itself take the chapter found the chapter page titled

301
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:47,719
the binding of the corpse god put it in the book and read it I cannot say no purple true beginning

302
00:52:47,719 --> 00:52:55,659
nor am I sure of its end so perhaps here is the best place to start I am reminded of ideas I first

303
00:52:55,659 --> 00:53:02,139
encountered in sir James George Frazier's book the golden bow a study in magic and religion

304
00:53:03,239 --> 00:53:07,800
we are overwhelmed by a very human need to weave a weather of 1400s and 1500s

305
00:53:09,989 --> 00:53:14,869
since time immemorial ancient peoples have dressed up their lack of knowledge

306
00:53:14,869 --> 00:53:19,110
as gods and demons I have discovered that sometimes

307
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:25,190
Bible the fates of gods and mortals intertwine legends are born I guess I am just describing

308
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:34,739
the Bible I'm like yeah well I want to I want more of that though my time is done read the

309
00:53:34,739 --> 00:53:43,059
bibles forever in shadow will you be master of chaos and to fade to nothing in obscurity

310
00:53:43,059 --> 00:53:52,340
will be thy fate many millennia for this day it is the true chaos of all things

311
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:59,460
that you now must be entombed amongst the beings of flesh and bone see you have a great monument

312
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:10,139
here mount rock it is a pity that no lies it as yours may the darkness claim the

313
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:18,860
chaos and damn beast no longer will thy reign be kept over the ancients you have kept imprisoned

314
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:31,260
thou hast seen the last of this world no I killed this guy on this thing under here

315
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:49,369
brushing all of his eyes this is purple guy so I have claimed this temple in the name of the green

316
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:57,880
guy not even these mythical fables can keep me amused yes there has to be something to do around

317
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:04,329
here I wish something that fantastic and of higher purpose could happen to me

318
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:21,639
all right let's go I have a weapon gonna be like puzzles here and shit in there okay a triangular

319
00:55:21,639 --> 00:55:27,000
design is carved into the floor the etched grooves are filled with colored sand related to each other

320
00:55:27,079 --> 00:55:33,159
yeah okay just keep this in mind we kick red's ass blue we have to run away from just remember

321
00:55:33,159 --> 00:55:47,449
that okay we are not afraid of anything red we are only afraid of blue statue of a goddess

322
00:55:47,449 --> 00:55:53,449
delicately sculpted from sandstone it casts an alert eye over everyone who enters the temple

323
00:55:53,449 --> 00:55:59,610
there's a strange necklace about its neck should ilia take the necklace from the statue yes

324
00:56:00,409 --> 00:56:13,530
strange necklace this necklace can be used to heal elia make sure that ilia does not move when

325
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:21,079
the spell is being cast okay there do I have to use it I can heal take a look at what we got for

326
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:46,500
doors here it's kind of dark don't you think we're gonna go left I'm gonna get up emote only mode

327
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:52,340
incoming um why okay this is gonna this is harder than I thought it was gonna be

328
00:56:54,820 --> 00:57:03,719
it's actually very easy it's not hard at all let's go left right

329
00:57:08,659 --> 00:57:13,780
sentence fortress oh shit I didn't even mean to do that correctly and I'm doing all right

330
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:30,760
I'm located by creatures a sanity loss occurs causing a decrease in the level of a sanity meter

331
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:35,239
and the character to pulse green beware sanity loss affects perception and eventually health

332
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:42,619
aren't these things in Zelda okay what just happened there's your sanity meter this meter

333
00:57:42,619 --> 00:57:47,980
represents a character's sanity every time he she meets a monster his sanity or her sanity will get

334
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:53,719
lower the lower the sanity meter the more the character will hallucinate yes okay here we go

335
00:57:54,360 --> 00:58:09,579
performing a finishing move on a creature recovers sanity that was fucking crazy give me that sanity

336
00:58:09,579 --> 00:58:23,849
back a bronze necklace take it I have two necklaces does one do more than the other

337
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:38,260
is that it not a door the design of the wall appears to depict the time of the day perhaps

338
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:47,820
the candles do too light or extinguish the candles no don't just smash it like a four-year-old

339
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:59,320
okay here we go okay so we need to we have extinguished them all one in the middle it's

340
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:20,150
sun time yeah I got it oh fuck I couldn't pay attention to what door just opened all right you

341
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:26,070

342
00:59:27,139 --> 00:59:30,579
and I you know when you drink it sometimes and you do something weird with your throat

343
00:59:30,579 --> 00:59:35,380
or you turn a weird way and it somehow hurts it goes into like your sinuses and in your nose

344
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:41,190
and it's like ah you like do it the wrong way somehow and it's just because it goes up to your

345
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:46,230
roof of your mouth and kind of into your yeah I hate that just happened like the worst it's

346
00:59:46,230 --> 01:00:08,519
ever been by the way that was horrible on charts finish the sanity meter if you don't know if you

348
01:00:11,719 --> 01:00:17,320
that he's playing well the whole point of this game is uh you have the sanity meter and the

349
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:23,929
game starts to really fuck with you game like deletes your save files like turns off the screen

350
01:00:23,929 --> 01:00:31,239
it torrents movies behind your back you know whatever it does it's not good it makes everything

355
01:01:16,309 --> 01:01:22,119
above the edge of the world I gotta remember that puzzle or I gotta remember that for some

356
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:28,550

365
01:03:31,179 --> 01:03:36,139

407
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:23,750

the essence of what's god the sun that is a source is small from those people you must

413
01:14:23,189 --> 01:14:28,949
get it unless they use it to destroy the little brightness your world has left in it

414
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:40,859
it's like if the heart in your body was as big as a sunflower seed it's not even a heart it's

415
01:14:41,899 --> 01:14:54,229
look at how big this guy is he's this guy is as big as three or four houses that was his heart

435
01:21:18,090 --> 01:21:22,890

briefly describes his mission the monk informs him that charlemagne was last seen in audience

467
01:26:57,060 --> 01:27:05,579
with the bishop in the visiting chamber is this why everyone was spamming for me to save the game

473
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:57,909

blade that's just passed down for 10 000 years right yeah the scrab mass six that sounds like

476
01:28:13,180 --> 01:28:21,159
me trying to say a word and that's me saying it incorrectly like that's me trying to say sacramento

477
01:28:21,159 --> 01:28:30,260
california that's like what i say in here in my head uh yeah i saw scratch the mass six california

482
01:29:21,020 --> 01:29:30,859
is locked and anthony will need the bishop's key to enter all right oh find this key the bishop's

488
01:31:06,359 --> 01:31:16,890
whoever wrote it was it was being dictated by somebody else or did like satan write the book

font but he was confronted by the bishop who was brandishing a large blade in whose eyes burned

514
01:36:03,020 --> 01:36:10,010
with an evil fire the monk dropped the urn out of shock and ran returning to retrieve the urn he

603
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:56,340
some see them as the meaningless tossing and turning of a brain settling into a restful sleep

604
01:58:57,779 --> 01:59:01,380
others see them as laden with symbols of our unconscious desires

605
01:59:02,810 --> 01:59:08,569
to still others dreams represent the upwelling of the archetypes normally hidden deep within

606
01:59:08,569 --> 01:59:16,649
the recesses of the human collective unconscious of one thing i am certain after a brush with the

just as i had alone since the death of his wife and since his children had their own adult lives

903
