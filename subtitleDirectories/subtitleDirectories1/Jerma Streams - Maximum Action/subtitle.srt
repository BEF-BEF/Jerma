00:00:00,890 --> 00:01:23,140
Hey, I want to grab my phone. Give me one second. All right, phone downstairs. Let me just make a

2
00:01:23,140 --> 00:02:12,979
tweet and I'll be with you shortly. Good afternoon. Continuing our stream journey from yesterday. I

3
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:25,379
said I was going to play max action, maximum action today, right now. Does anyone actually

4
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:41,669
believe that Jerm is a real person? Anywho, I'm going to turn it on. This game is an action game.

5
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:51,210
Of course it is. No, no, it's a reading game. This is a second grade reading, teaching second graders

6
00:02:51,210 --> 00:03:02,729
how to read. Imagine naming your game maximum action and it's just a reading game. I should,

7
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:16,870
I'm going to do that. I should do that. Where's Terraria? You're going to have to ask Mr. Star

8
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:24,460
that question because Terraria, his computer was broken last time I talked to him and he was like,

9
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:37,449
my PSU. I think I got that right. Power supply. I don't know. Maybe this weekend. We'll see what

10
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:53,159
he's doing. But hope you're having a good day. Let's get started. I have the game up. Now I

11
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:59,939
don't know how much content is in this game. I think there's probably like less than an hour or

12
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:12,090
two of content. So from here, we are going to play probably rollercoaster tycoon two. Michael

13
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:22,279
action movie. Wait, it's a movie. Michael action maximum productions. I don't know. That's just a

14
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:44,790
placeholder. Okay. How about, uh, just call me Mike. Movie studio name. How about, uh, does this,

15
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:55,259
I don't think this even matters. We don't care about this paid promotion. I've, I've, I don't

16
00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:11,540
do those paid promotion. Uh, this is not, I'm just, that's a good, that's a good title.

17
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:43,850
It's like half-life characters. All right. I guess, well, you know, it's gotta be like the,

18
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:58,790
the German colors, right? This is gloves. Outer body. Let's go. There we go. Hello, body. Glove.

19
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:19,050
No, we need more blue. Change of glasses too. All right. It looks all right. Tutorial. All

20
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,490
scenes are a work in progress. Maybe missing assets, textures, or gameplay elements and not

21
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:27,769
representative of final product. Well, this game is about, it's kind of like a combination of what

22
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:35,110
I'm told is there's like Max Payne, John Wick and hotline Miami. It looked at, it was a recommendation.

23
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:45,420
Looked interesting. I felt this, I felt like I wanted to play it. All right. How are you, how

24
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:56,699

26
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:12,149
Okay. FOV 90 or next game. I think it already is.

27
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:25,660
Oh shit. It's not. You got me. How would you know that? How would you possibly know that? No,

28
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:31,180
this is no way.

29
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:54,949
Press R to reload. Press E to pick up weapons. Okay. Now what? What do I do? Press zero

30
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:07,620
to do what? Oh, I do that. Where is it not loaded? Okay. He's jumping. Press G to drop weapons.

31
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:17,720
You know, you could throw shit. Okay. Let me, I got to rewind that. Just put that at the other mouse.

32
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:27,639
That's good. Right there. Okay. Good. It's empty. All right. So now what do I go?

33
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:38,059
That's kind of fun. What is the TV that tells me what to do? Oh,

34
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:56,580
let's go. Hold left shift to slow down time. That's pretty cool. All right. Press left shift to enter

35
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:13,820
action time. Hold. Okay. So that's the same thing. Time moves as you shoot. Hold down

36
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:18,539
to slow down time. Okay. And then press it to do action time. That's what I just did.

37
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:32,090
Time moves when you shoot. That's not happening. Yes. The binding. Why is the binding the same?

38
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:42,570
Come on. Action time. Left shift. I think that's just, I think that's just what it is.

39
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:48,100
Yeah. Okay. Just, you just, I just tapped it. Yeah.

40
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,450
Gain action time through movement, sprinting, diving, and sliding.

41
00:09:56,309 --> 00:09:58,409

00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:42,919
Hold on. Damn. That's cool. All right. Press X to use the grenade launcher.

45
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:58,779
Okay. X to use grenade launcher. There it is. Throwing weapons, diving and kicking can break

46
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:12,070
glass. Good. Press use to continue. I feel like this is going to be really, really fun.

47
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:18,700
Okay. I don't know if that's supposed to happen. All right. Get the henchmen.

48
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:27,580
All right. What do I want to use? This one and this one. I don't have that many hands.

49
00:11:28,299 --> 00:12:09,850
Let's go. All right. I got it. Great job. I did it. I got all the henchmen. All right. Let's go.

50
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:18,860
So let's just do the intro. Is there like, I don't think there's a story in this game.

51
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:30,740
All right. I'm ready. Do you have to go fast? Punch here. All right. First aid. Hold mouse

00:12:39,059 --> 00:13:01,289
Stop that. Okay. I got it. Can I pick the bed up? Wait. Bucket. Frash. Okay. Dive. Hold mouse

54
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:15,419

55
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:19,820
through the door ahead, the game will begin to record your action. Your goal is to create the

56
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:26,139
most action-packed take and receive the highest action score possible. You can rewatch your scene

57
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:35,980
once you have completed the section. Good luck. All right. Wait. I didn't go through the door yet.

58
00:13:35,980 --> 00:14:35,799
Wait. Oh. Am I dead? What? Should I? Can I watch my movie? Where's my movie? Scene select. Other

59
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:47,580
modes. Other modes? Endless mode. All of us are a work in progress. Scene select. Do I have to

60
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:53,820
beat it before I can see it? I have to win to get the movie. All right. Fucking. That's easy. Let's

61
00:14:53,820 --> 00:15:11,860
go. This is loud. Okay. Let's go. I gotta get good to get the movie. All right. We'll start with the

62
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:54,860
TV. All right. I just Dragon Ball Z'd that guy. He ain't getting up. Here we go. Action. All right.

63
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:29,399
And close it. Oops. Bounce. Holy shit. That's too many. I need a gun. Oh boy. Try to keep going.

64
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:39,850
Exit. What the fuck? I didn't have any bullets left. Okay. I'm getting it. I'm understanding it.

65
00:16:39,850 --> 00:17:24,809
And those are not infinite bullets. No. Stop. Get up. Why am I falling down? Let's go. Which way should I go?

66
00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:52,220
Is that a baseball bat? Give me that gun. Give me. No. Give me the gun. Gun. Gun. Gun. Where's he?

67
00:17:52,220 --> 00:18:08,599
This thing's empty. Stop. Give me the gun. How close do I have to be to get the gun?

68
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:30,119
Free bolts. I get it. Let's see it. Let's see if it was any good.

69
00:18:47,849 --> 00:19:27,660
I keep fucking proning. Oh, I switched to press V. What's happening over there?

70
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:40,019
I did it. Let's go. Continue. I'm understanding how this is played.

71
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:55,509
Too quiet? Too quiet? What does this say? Is this mouse sensitivity? All right. I'm ready.

72
00:19:55,509 --> 00:20:18,410
Scene select. Scene one. Action. No. Go back in. I had to kick this guy out the window.

73
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:59,380
I got it. You guys wanted it loud, huh? Wait. What's this? No. This way. That's gonna be good.

74
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:34,809
That's gonna be a good scene. No. I didn't want to do that. I thought it exploded. Shit. I was too

75
00:21:35,289 --> 00:22:34,950
insane. Oh, God. I got destroyed. One action movie. It's a Call of Duty camper. Shit. Is he dead?

76
00:22:40,490 --> 00:23:15,509
Got it. Let's go. Oh, you can go over 100 health. That's good to know.

77
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:58,089
Slide. I thought I threw that and caught it in midair. Who? Excuse me. All right. Slide. Action. Slide.

78
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:31,990
They're dead. Okay. Never mind. Let's go. Get out there. All right. Do I have bullets?

79
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:50,680
Which way do I go? Where do I go? Where do I go? Where do I go? Over here. What? Is there a boss?

80
00:24:51,400 --> 00:25:52,099
Oh, God. I think it's a boss. I can't pick that up. Ow. That's so loud in my ears. Slide. Away from

81
00:25:52,099 --> 00:26:17,930
the fight. I turned the sensitivity too high. I get it. Here we go. It's too loud. All right.

82
00:26:17,930 --> 00:27:02,710
Let's watch the movie. All right. Even there. I'm lost. The actor doesn't even know where to go.

83
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:09,380
Uh, come on. Chaz, you really fucked it up. You missed your marks like five times.

84
00:27:10,259 --> 00:28:09,099
Oh, that was so stupid. I dove on my own grenade. Here we go. Switch. This is

85
00:28:09,099 --> 00:28:18,500
when I'm trying to figure out how to switch weapons. Good job, Chaz. Oh, health. It's so loud.

86
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,779
I have to turn it off.

87
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:59,059
That's, that's, that's something. It sure is. Coming up next is, uh, the streets. The streets

88
00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:06,970
available? Yeah. I'm going to try to do something actual cool. Okay. Actually cool. I'm going to do

89
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:44,009
the, there's going to be stealth movie so far. Not bad. Nevermind. I can still do it. I think.

90
00:30:12,740 --> 00:31:02,539
All right. Movie's still going. I need health. No. Whoops. Where's the gun? I lost my stealth gun.

91
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:37,609
Out of bullets. What's that? God damn it. Give it to me. I need health. Oh my God. I'm almost dead.

92
00:31:39,500 --> 00:32:56,250
Oh, fuck. All right. This movie's too long. Oh, what happened? Oh my God. That guy blew up.

93
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:21,299
Good. I just pressed the button. I kind of want to do that one again. Just run and press the button.

94
00:33:36,579 --> 00:34:02,920
Good shot of the wall. Oh, I double stopped that guy. I think I can get it. I can think,

95
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:07,000
I think I can slow mo run through the whole level and just jump and touch the thing.

96
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:28,199
How am I going backwards? Was that my voice? Didn't I go like, oh yeah. I screamed there,

97
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:45,159
didn't I? I'm going to try that again. I think I can do it. Ready? I just have to believe.

98
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:43,300
Jump off the wall. Jump off the wall. No. All right. Still worked. Stuck.

99
00:35:44,809 --> 00:36:05,639
Somebody up top here, right? They're still chasing me. Oh, shit. Just touch the button. I did it.

100
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:31,510
Okay, good. Let's see how that one turned out. I really didn't want to shoot anyone.

101
00:36:32,150 --> 00:37:06,280
Did I jump on top of the bullet? Okay. What are these edits? This is the kind of edit where

102
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:13,849
this is a flashback sequence. This is not even happening in real time. This is just,

103
00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:19,980
I'm having a vision flashback sequence. What the fuck is going on? That didn't happen.

104
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:36,380
He shot me that many times. Remember that. You can die in the recording. All right. Restaurant.

105
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:42,090
Thank you PJFS for the five community subs and Chris Bach for the five community subs as well.

106
00:37:42,090 --> 00:38:14,389
Here we go. Hold on. Let me see if I can be like a Mario. Oh, fuck. I'm in trouble.

107
00:38:14,389 --> 00:38:47,349
Give it. Nothing in here. Oh, shit. Give me the chair. Chair. Anything. Something. Shit.

108
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:54,949
No. They're spawning it. Give me the health. Get the health, please. I jumped over it.

109
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:47,320
Fuck. Give me the shotgun. Give me the shotgun. Okay. I have two health. I gotta do this right.

110
00:39:48,039 --> 00:41:07,880
Just throw a grenade out there. What? That wasn't a headshot? All right. Here we go. Damn.

111
00:41:16,679 --> 00:42:07,130
Press P. Sandbox. All right. Let's go. Okay. Why did you tell me I could do that?

112
00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:49,590
Let me beat the levels first. Oh, that was so loud in my ears. Get me over here. Oh,

113
00:42:49,590 --> 00:43:09,260
just throw a grenade. No, don't throw it. Win your trajectory. All right. Let me relax for a second.

114
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:28,539
What the fuck was that? Was it a grenade that he throw? I didn't know they could throw grenades.

115
00:43:55,139 --> 00:44:10,179
I can do that shit too. I got it. That's going to be a good scene. All right. I got 86 health.

116
00:44:10,179 --> 00:44:24,469
Here we go. This is it. Where did they go? What? Why are they not there? I just blew up the fucking

117
00:44:24,469 --> 00:44:53,769
health. Oh, my God. Give me a break. Get in there. Where's the guy with the laser? There's a guy

118
00:44:53,769 --> 00:45:25,980
with the laser. Laser. Where's the guy with the laser? Why? That just hurt. All right. I made it.

119
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:40,139
Watch this funny thing at the end. No. I wanted to watch the... I can just do better this time.

120

This is the big scene at the end here. Big finish. How do I want to... Grenade off the wall.

122
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:37,449
Got it. Let's watch the movie. Did I just drop the gun? Oh, I dropped the gun. I'll pick up another

123
00:47:37,449 --> 00:48:03,690
one. Press V. V. Why do you want this angle? This angle sucks. You can't see anything.

124
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:14,730
It's just this guy. There's nothing here. What an intense action movie this is. All right, guys.

125
00:48:23,849 --> 00:48:39,420
No, it's not free cam. I can't move around. How do you move around? I'm stuck here. Arrow keys?

126
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:56,409
No, it's not the arrow keys. I didn't even do anything.

127
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:16,599
Number pad? No, it's not the number pad. Press P. All right. We'll do... Let me go through each

128
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:32,440
level first. All right. Jungle. I'm going to make this one worth watching. Ready? 30 bullets in

129
00:49:32,440 --> 00:50:20,739
each one. Get down. Catch it. Catch it. I think I just... Did I shoot myself? I think I just

130
00:50:20,739 --> 00:50:55,320
shot myself in the back of the head. What just blew up behind me? Who's shooting this?

131
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:13,929
Okay. I need health. Health is over here. Oh, my God. Okay. Don't... I don't want to... I can't

132
00:51:13,929 --> 00:51:23,960
fuck this up. I got to... Does this have any more? Look, this has 60 rounds. Why does this have so...

133
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,210
Look at all this. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

134
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:59,400
Where do I go from here? Health? Whoa. Somebody else is firing. Do a rocket jump. No. I'll die

135
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:07,849
instantly. I got to jump up and hit this guy. I just snuck it over. Just barely snuck it over.

136
00:52:07,849 --> 00:52:38,650
Okay. Hold on. Fuck. Oh, shit. He's here. Exit. I did it. Oh, he has a rocket launcher. Get rid

137
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:55,670
of his rocket launcher first. All right. I got it. Minimal action. Can I time it? Can I shoot one

138
00:52:55,670 --> 00:53:13,690
in the air? Is this going to come back down? I don't think so. Like five hands. You had the

139
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:59,539
worst rocket jump of all the TF2 YouTubers. I don't... All right. Who cares? Where am I?

140
00:53:59,539 --> 00:54:09,179
Oh, my God. Why are there rocket launchers over here? You're rubbing your butt on the ground like

141
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:24,219
a dog. Look at this hesitation. Because I know I would blow myself up in a second with this thing.

142
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:55,989
Complete fear. What? Oh, yeah. Wait, did I hit a guy from across the map?

143
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:14,280
I think I hit a guy direct across the map. Did that happen? Hold on a minute. Let's take a look

144
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:49,539
at that again. I love this. I love this stupid action movie movie. It's so janky. This is the

145
00:55:49,539 --> 00:55:57,130
third game you've played in a row where you're making a movie. Well, I mean, I went fishing

146
00:55:57,130 --> 00:56:08,949
yesterday. I didn't know that this had this. I thought it was just an action game. This makes

147
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:23,179
it so much more interesting for me. All right. Pay attention here. So I jump. I think I... Do I

148
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:31,269
shoot somebody accidentally? Oh, no. Okay. I was aiming for that guy, I guess. It was a different

149
00:56:31,269 --> 00:56:50,900
cut last time. The audio is breaking. Maximum coward is what somebody said. Okay. This is fun.

150
00:56:50,900 --> 00:57:05,960
All right. Let's go back to the room. Get this saloon. All right. Now I'm going to do a cowboy

151
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:36,469
movie here. Single action. Why is that guy still standing up? Get this fucking door out of here.

152
00:57:36,469 --> 00:58:22,710
What? Was he shooting me on the ground? Double kick that guy. Who's next?

153
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:48,489
Give me that one. Good catch. Fourth arm. Wait. Hold on a second. That'll be a really long gun.

154
00:58:49,530 --> 00:59:09,900
Okay. Wait. Wait. Time out. Time out. Time out. Time out. Time out. Time out. Okay. Time out. All

155
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:24,329
right. Oh shit. That was loud. I need to get rid of this. Get... No. Get rid of this. That's not

156
00:59:24,409 --> 00:59:31,690
Maximum coward. It's called I need to have... Get rid of one of these. Oh shit. No. Get rid of this.

157
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:43,590
Somebody has their arms behind me. Like whose line is it anyways?

158
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:53,269
I'm not a coward. I just don't want to die here. Okay. Here we go.

159
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:16,519
I'm just slowly falling down the stairs. All right. I got lots of ammo in this thing.

160
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:56,489
What the fuck? How many times do you have to shoot a guy in the fucking face? Oh my god. I shot

161
01:00:56,489 --> 01:01:49,619
that guy like four times. I shot that guy like three times in the face. What's with the doors?

162
01:01:56,010 --> 01:03:10,469
That's impossible. Oh fuck. This one's hard. Oh shit. Do I have a gun? That guy's got a gun.

163
01:03:10,469 --> 01:03:27,659
That guy has a gun. That's who shot me last time. No. Don't. If I can hit once, I'm dead.

164
01:03:46,469 --> 01:04:28,969
Dead. Oh my god. Throw a grenade up there. No. Please. Are they dead? All right. Get me up there.

165
01:04:28,969 --> 01:06:38,789
Okay. Go. No. Am I... I'm not even staying. I'm about to just... I can't do it. Jesus. Here we go.

166
01:06:38,789 --> 01:06:49,860
The camera doesn't know where it wants to be. You can see how... You can see how upset I was

167
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:54,969
right here. Like I have to do this again. I was really, really trying right here.

168
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:29,860
The hell am I... I didn't do that. I did not do that. That was added in. Damn it. Oh shit. I'm gonna

169
01:07:29,860 --> 01:08:05,400
run. Got him. I wish it captured the voice too. You can just hear me. What was going on here?

170
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:29,100
Oh, the guy had a gun, right? Camera. Yeah, I had two HP.

171
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:50,619
Why did I let... What? Why did I drop the gun? I didn't let go of the gun?

172
01:08:56,460 --> 01:09:07,029
What am I doing? Waving at them? That guy just landed on his head. I am so confused. I am

173
01:09:07,029 --> 01:09:25,609
telepathically beating these people up with my fists. Okay. This makes no sense. Yeah, this is

174
01:09:25,609 --> 01:10:00,550
my favorite scene in the movie. Stop looking down. You know you're having a real problem when

175
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:23,779
you're looking straight at your feet. This time more with feeling. Oh yeah, I'm trying to jump

176
01:10:23,779 --> 01:10:43,029
off the walls now, I think. Nope. Just trying to get leverage from the bar. Oh yeah, this is

177
01:10:43,029 --> 01:11:43,109
crouch jump. Crouch jump. Crouch jump wasn't doing it either. That was a great movie. Yes, fantastic.

178
01:11:50,069 --> 01:12:32,489
Uh, arctic. I'm gonna try to get only headshots. Oh, that's a grenade. It's an enough a grenade.

179
01:12:33,050 --> 01:13:08,199
Okay, we're good. He walked over to it. Oh my god. I mean, that was very clearly...

180
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:34,579
That was a headshot. It was. I mean, health. Is it health back here? Something blew up.

181
01:13:36,699 --> 01:14:36,619
Oh, fuck. That is ultimate panic. Is that it? I think that's it. Oh, no. Yeah, I don't like how

182
01:14:36,619 --> 01:15:29,449
quiet this is. I can hit once I'm dead. Health? Anywhere? I'm almost out of ammo. I think this

183
01:15:29,449 --> 01:15:51,909
ammo... this health right there. Is he dead? Yes. Got it. Oh shit. I want the one with the ammo.

184
01:15:51,909 --> 01:16:47,659
What's in there? Double health. Oh yeah. Do I have to go down? Did I open it? Can I just get down there

185
01:16:47,659 --> 01:17:31,460
from here? I think this is the action shot where I jump all the way down. Got it. Bingo. That's gonna

186
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:48,039
be a good one. That was a first try scenario. What is this? Oh, I thought... right, I was... oh,

187
01:17:48,039 --> 01:18:25,560
headshots only, I remember. That was so violent. I love when you dive backwards. You just stick

188
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:37,020
your legs up. That's... that's all a dive is, is you just fold your legs back. Did I die? That's

189
01:18:37,100 --> 01:19:10,039
like a... oh, you got me. No, he's still alive. Just trying to make it look interesting.

190
01:19:22,229 --> 01:19:41,579
I had two HP this whole time. I wonder if that door doesn't open. Give me this. No, that one

191
01:19:41,579 --> 01:19:52,340
doesn't open either. I guess we're gonna go this way. You can just feel the internal monologue.

192
01:19:52,340 --> 01:20:11,060
Why would the camera be in the ground pointing up? You'd think you'd just want like have a static.

193
01:20:11,699 --> 01:20:26,779
Oh, that guy got a few shots. Not a whole lot.

194
01:20:54,920 --> 01:21:03,539
I just took one right in the throat. That was like right into my... right into my jugular.

195
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:32,100
I need to play dubstep. See, this is the point. I remember right here.

196
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:34,899
This is the point where everyone was screaming blind.

197
01:21:34,899 --> 01:21:45,689
Blind. Blind. Blind. Turn around. Turn around. You are so dumb. You missed it. Blind. Wait,

198
01:21:45,689 --> 01:21:57,779
no. What is it? Over here. Oh, sorry. Can you hear the sound? Those little...

199
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:13,180
audios compressing into itself. What are you showing me? Oh, I'm trying to... yeah, right.

200
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:17,380
I was trying to jump over. Now that was a good shot. I wish they stayed on it.

201
01:22:27,899 --> 01:22:38,810
That's not what happened. I landed with such explosive ferocity. That's the end of that one.

202
01:22:45,939 --> 01:22:51,140
All right, we have rooftop. I think that's the last one until I'm gonna just do...

203
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:55,939
I'm gonna make my... I'm gonna just go into the editor and like mess around.

204
01:22:57,430 --> 01:23:56,680
Rooftop. Okay, at least it worked. Where's this gun? Where's this guy's gun? Did I get him? I

205
01:23:56,680 --> 01:24:20,649
don't... I don't even know if I got him. Where are the guns? All right, did... do not drop it.

206
01:24:20,649 --> 01:24:44,489
Is this guy still... Okay, they don't have any guns. I'll take that. Don't go too far.

207
01:24:45,210 --> 01:26:01,180
No, don't, don't, don't, don't. That was really easy. That was really easy. Yeah!

208
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:30,260
Now where do I go? I'm just not gonna snipe this guy from really far away. Watch this.

209
01:26:51,399 --> 01:27:16,020
Yeah! Adam Sandler. That's not Adam Sandler. All right, exit up there. Yeah, it is, isn't it?

210
01:27:16,739 --> 01:27:47,960
Wait, no. Is that... where do I go? That way? That's where I came from. Ramp. What do I mean?

211
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:59,579
Was it ramp? Ramp? Under there. What do you mean under there? Go under there. What do you mean

212
01:27:59,579 --> 01:28:13,699
under? Over here? All right, ramp. Found the ramp. Don't fall off this shit. Oh my god! Okay, I'm

213
01:28:13,699 --> 01:28:18,970
fine. I didn't... I didn't think there was a gap. I just screamed really loud because this is a good

214
01:28:18,970 --> 01:29:12,180
run. Up. Um, okay, there's a... lead the target. I just fucking missed. That wasn't even where I

215
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:37,750
was aiming. Am I lying down? I'm lying on my back. Why can I not hit this thing? Oh my...

216
01:29:42,569 --> 01:30:10,550
Yeah! I still... how did I still get that? There's no way. Oh, I can't hit this. Nice.

217
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:43,659
Double. Print it. Really? Oh fuck, I have no... oh, I don't want to do this too far...

218
01:30:43,659 --> 01:31:13,210
too much in front of my own face. No, he's getting too close. What do I do? What? Did I explode too

219
01:31:13,210 --> 01:31:41,140
fast? Okay. Oh shit. Get it again. Get it again. Get it again. Get it again. Get it again. Get it

220
01:31:41,140 --> 01:31:43,779
again. Get it again. Get it again. I can do it twice. I can do it twice. It's gonna be the end

221
01:31:43,779 --> 01:31:51,319
of the movie right here. The end of the movie. Final scene of the movie. Here it is. I can get it.

222
01:31:51,319 --> 01:32:17,819
I can get it. I can get it. I can get it. I can get it. Get out of here. I did it. It's over. That

223
01:32:17,819 --> 01:32:43,699
was a six minute movie. Here we go. Let's take a look. I was trying to jump off the other side.

224
01:33:04,420 --> 01:33:06,100
This is so fucking bad.

225
01:33:18,899 --> 01:33:32,090
I got him. Okay, good. Am I gonna try the other modes? Oh, absolutely.

226
01:33:32,970 --> 01:33:37,460
This is where I'm searching for the gun, but I can't find it.

227
01:33:44,420 --> 01:33:51,399
Acid base? I can't stop this right now. I'm afraid to. I feel like if I hit escape or

228
01:33:51,399 --> 01:34:26,920
something, it'll ruin everything. Play it from your phone. I can do that. Here we go.

229
01:35:16,939 --> 01:36:22,460
It didn't even show it. This didn't happen. This didn't fucking happen. Why is the helicopter

230
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:53,640
still there? I'm so confused right now. Just landing and taking off. I'm picking the lid up.

231
01:37:19,819 --> 01:37:35,159
That looks cool though. It does. This thing's not gonna go in to the glass that I jumped through,

232
01:37:35,159 --> 01:38:07,750
right? This looks way, way worse than what I thought it was looking like when I was playing.

233
01:38:25,460 --> 01:38:31,989
Now, wait a minute. This is where it happens. There's two more helicopters that come up.

234
01:38:37,590 --> 01:38:53,750
Right? What is happening? I did not hit that. I did not do that.

235
01:38:54,550 --> 01:39:46,020
What is going on? There's two helicopters chasing me. Why am I aiming down at the glass behind me?

236
01:39:46,979 --> 01:40:01,739
Don't I fire this? Why have I not fired the rocket launcher one time? I clearly didn't

237
01:40:01,739 --> 01:40:19,289
shoot it like five times. What am I firing at? I do not aim at the helicopter. Is this somebody

238
01:40:19,289 --> 01:40:35,539
else's replay? I want to watch this from the first person perspective. You know what I mean?

239
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:54,739
We need to see a clear indicator of what happened. Can I fast forward? I can't. This is great. This

240
01:40:54,739 --> 01:41:03,300
is the only, hold on. This is the only camera that's in this room. I can't move this anywhere else.

241
01:41:17,399 --> 01:41:27,500
All right. All right. We don't have to see it again. So let's see. Other modes. All levels are

242
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:33,579
work in progress. Dojo. Canyon. Where? So there's more. Restaurant. Garage. Tutorial. Rooftops.

243
01:41:33,579 --> 01:41:43,560
All right. So lobby. Dojo. Canyon. Is it endless mode? Does this have a film? This is video tape?

244
01:41:44,600 --> 01:42:02,439
Oh, I died. Okay. I think I can just place enemies places, right? Yeah, this is just like a sandbox.

245
01:42:12,250 --> 01:42:41,109
All right. Well, hold on. Props. Items. No. Weapons. Characters. Where did the

246
01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:54,659
rocket come from? Characters. Suit guy. Can I give them something to fit in health?

247
01:42:55,539 --> 01:43:21,479
The game spawns. Go right. Does it? Spawn health all over me. Go right. Oh, what do you mean go

248
01:43:21,479 --> 01:43:35,399
right? Down here? I don't think I can go down there. North left. That's not even real.

249
01:43:37,140 --> 01:43:46,699
No, I think this is like a little sandbox level. Nothing over here.

250
01:43:47,420 --> 01:43:55,989
No. Okay. Let me do one thing. Items. First aid.

251
01:43:58,710 --> 01:44:13,659
What's the max health? I mean, I think 1100 is pretty good. 1500. Whatever. Okay. Now characters.

252
01:44:17,880 --> 01:45:00,380
I don't have any weapons. No clip? Thank you. Oh, fuck. I'm dead. All right. Is there anything

253
01:45:00,380 --> 01:45:07,779
else that I could do? Just like the scene. Let me look at the scene creator. Create scene. Oh,

254
01:45:07,779 --> 01:45:25,140
Jeremy. Okay. What do I want to name for your scene? Test. Let's just test it out.

255
01:45:29,779 --> 01:45:36,659
Mouse three to rotate objects. Start recordings. Maximum action editor. Floor clone. Mouse two,

256
01:45:36,659 --> 01:45:49,770
delete. Move object down. X to undo. Mouse one to move objects. Okay. Editor menu. Floor five by

257
01:45:49,850 --> 01:46:10,859
five. Okay. What else can I get in here? Objects. Can I do a

258
01:46:13,909 --> 01:46:29,130
snow guy? Where's the helicopter? I don't even see the crossbow. Really? That would have been

259
01:46:29,130 --> 01:46:39,939
fun to use. All right. Space, move object up. Place objects. Yeah. You can pick them up and

260
01:46:39,939 --> 01:46:51,609
put them down. All right. Well, I mean, that's cool if I wanted to. Why am I moving? That'd be

261
01:46:51,609 --> 01:47:01,579
fun. I don't think I want to really sit here and learn it though. So I think that's it for

262
01:47:01,579 --> 01:47:08,500
what about what's weapon room? Ah, now this is what I'm talking about. Okay. So you can test

263
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:35,189
it with a crossbow. I want to use the crossbow. Is it not here? Am I stupid? I think I might be

264
01:47:35,189 --> 01:48:00,340
stupid. Wait. No. Damn it. Endless mode. Act one. What? What do you mean? What? Endless arena.

265
01:48:02,949 --> 01:48:06,630
Armory. Endless. Why? This is a weird menu. Endless arena?

266
01:48:07,350 --> 01:48:33,460
Press to begin endless mode. You will not be able to leave. This is too bright. I thought this was

267
01:48:33,460 --> 01:48:52,180
a gun on the wall. This hurts my head. I need to, I want to go somewhere else. I can't, I can't look

268
01:48:52,180 --> 01:49:12,199
at this. Other modes. Dusk. Everyone was saying do dusk. Let's go AK. Okay. 30 is 60. Crossbow.

269
01:49:12,199 --> 01:49:22,140
Nice. Finally. It's got a red dot. You got it. It's going to use the crossbow. Press to begin

270
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:38,390
endless mode. All right. Let's go. Explain to me what is going on right now. Uh, those are my

271
01:49:38,390 --> 01:50:20,489
arrows. I'm confused. All right. I can't, I can't. Let's try this again. All right. Let's go. Current

272
01:50:20,489 --> 01:50:59,319
wave. Here it comes. How's that not hitting you? Oh, fuck. It did hit you. Get in the house. All

273
01:50:59,319 --> 01:51:53,460
right. Wave two. I gotta, that's just stay in the house. You did, I did a better job than you.

274
01:51:53,460 --> 01:52:27,960
Shit. I'm gonna die. Okay. Damn it. Well, that's cool. I wish it recorded this. Yeah. All right.

275
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:36,229
Any other modes? Endless mode. The cutting room floor. What does that mean? Endless mode. The

276
01:52:36,229 --> 01:53:07,829
cutting room floor. I'm not quite sure what this does. This is a weird view. I think it just

277
01:53:07,829 --> 01:53:30,359
records the whole thing. Oh, fuck. I'm out of ammo. Didn't say what it was. All right. Well,

278
01:53:30,359 --> 01:54:00,810
this is another level. It's like a different area. Oh, get out of the way. Oh, you're playing old

279
01:54:00,810 --> 01:54:05,739
levels that are, okay. These are not official levels anymore. Okay. I get you. So these are,

280
01:54:05,739 --> 01:54:11,739
this is like the first pass of that, uh, this rooftop level. That's all right. That's cool,

281
01:54:11,739 --> 01:54:19,850
though. You can still play them. All right. I'm going to pee my pants. I drank a large coffee.

282
01:54:20,569 --> 01:54:33,159
Why do I always say that? Because it's, it's true. I would pee my pants if I wasn't smart.

283
01:54:34,439 --> 01:54:49,050
Where's the exit? Somewhere over here. Where am I going? Am I missing something?

284
01:55:03,989 --> 01:55:26,949
The TV. Look at the TV. They give you a lot of those. All right. We'll move on. What did

285
01:55:26,949 --> 01:55:29,189
I say in the very beginning of the stream? That there was probably less than a couple

286
01:55:29,189 --> 01:55:36,020
hours of content so far. Yeah. That's really fun though. It is. It's fun. I love when games add

287
01:55:37,350 --> 01:55:45,399
a little something interesting without that movie mode. I think the movie mode makes it

288
01:55:45,399 --> 01:55:51,159
huge. And if they continue to develop this and add more stuff and add more camera controls,

289
01:55:51,159 --> 01:56:04,569
and I think it'll be really, really fun. Old. Yeah. Okay. All right. So what we're going to do

290
01:56:04,569 --> 01:56:10,199
now, I'm going to go pee. I'm going to come back and I'm going to play a little bit of

291
01:56:10,199 --> 01:56:21,560
Rollercoaster Tycoon 2. That's the plan. But no, that was fun. That was absolutely like fun,

292
01:56:21,560 --> 01:56:27,239
funny, and worth playing. So I'll be right back. We'll change games. See you guys in a minute.
