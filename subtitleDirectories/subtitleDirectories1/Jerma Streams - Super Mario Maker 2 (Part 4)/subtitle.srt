00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:17,560
Hello. I don't know what the emote is. What is it? Pepe face? Pepe laugh? Laughing face?

2
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:28,540
You know the one I'm talking about. Everybody knows about it. Do I have to explain what I mean

3
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:42,859
by Pepe face in the title? What is it called? I don't even have it activated. It's like Pepe

4
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:48,840
laugh or something. I don't know. The one where it's like Pepe the frog and his teeth are showing

5
00:01:48,840 --> 00:02:01,349
like this and he's leaning back in his chair. Why is my mic quality so bad? Am I in the wrong mic?

6
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:12,039
No I'm not. Why is my mic quality so bad? I don't know.

7
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:24,569
I don't know. I think I have a nice mic. Who knows? It's not even been one minute

8
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:32,419
and Phylactery Lich just gave $50. 5000. But that didn't mean life at 30 seconds.

9
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,099
Watching your old videos reminds me of how old I am. Anyways, here's some casino money. Thank you.

10
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:50,550
Really appreciate that. Watching old videos of mine reminds me of how old I am too. Because

11
00:02:50,550 --> 00:03:00,379
I get to watch myself degrade over time. I get a 10-year mirror. Don't you understand?

12
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:09,699
I can watch. Guys, I used to make a video like every other day. You know that thing? Oh,

13
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:17,370
take a picture of myself once every day for 10 years. I did that. I can go back and just see

14
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:30,740
me aging over a decade. You're aging like fine wine. Hey, thanks. I think I'm doing okay.

15
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,879
Oh, but anyways, let's talk about some stuff before we get started. I know, I always do.

16
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:43,639
All right, here we go. He's gonna talk about stuff. This one's important. Nobody say it.

17
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:49,960
Nobody say it because I didn't get a chance to tell anybody yet. Don't say it. Don't say it.

18
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:56,469
Ah, somebody said it. Ah, shit. What do I do now? Turn the stream off.

19
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:19,000
The carnival stream is set for September 21st, 2019. Of this year. Of this year. So I'm fucking

20
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,639
excited. A lot of work and a lot of time went into this. And I hadn't even gotten started.

21
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:34,569
I actually have to get on a plane next week and fly across the country to the facility

22
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:40,389
and go back and forth. We're gonna do a site visit. We're gonna walk around. We're gonna

23
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:55,420
talk about everything that's gonna happen. It is not Boston. No, somewhere else. It is somewhere

24
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:06,649
else in the United States of America. But the facility seems pretty great. The person that's

25
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:13,529
helping me and the team that's helping me work on that end of things. Area 51. No, it's not in

26
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:26,329
Nevada. It's in another state in the United States. No, it's not Florida. Wait, we don't have to guess

27
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:40,949
what state it is. You're gonna find out soon enough. He's going to Canada. No, but that's a

28
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:49,019
reality now. And a bunch of resources going into this. I can finally tell you that it's really

29
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:54,970
actually September 21st. There's like two teams involved with this. So it's not like, oh September

30
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:03,980
23rd, maybe maybe October. No, it's a contract. So I hope it's fun. You'll get more details as we go.

31
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:22,329
Let's hope it's I think it's gonna be fucking awesome. Get a lawyer. I am a lawyer. I just

32
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:28,569
looked. It's a big contract. It's like 25 pages long. And I just like skimmed it. And I was like,

33
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:40,360
yeah. And I flipped it over. I signed it. The best kind of lawyer there is one's one that skims

34
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:54,069
contracts. Click agree. Yeah. It's an it's the end user license agreement on anything you play

35
00:06:54,069 --> 00:07:06,620
or do. I don't want to sound out of the loop here, but or sound mean. But why are you doing this?

36
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:25,459
I don't know. I because I because I want to. This is real. Do I have I don't really have a

37
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:32,680
reason for anything I do here. Mainly, I think it's because I think it'll be fun.

38
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:41,259
And I think the community over the years has been involved in so many things. And we've done so

39
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:50,730
many things that it's just it's fun to do shit. It's fun to make stuff. I don't really have a

40
00:07:50,730 --> 00:08:09,879
reason. And they open it up at like win or lose. I don't care. I want to try. I want to try to do

41
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:23,180
something fun. I think that you guys know that over the years like that's something. Hey,

42
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:41,750
Super Mario Maker 2. Is it going to be a film crew? Yes. This is me playing by the way. Oops,

43
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:51,179
never mind. Now that was the computer. All right. So I'm going to play just random levels. What do

44
00:08:51,179 --> 00:09:02,200
you guys know we can tell? All right. Give me fun levels. I don't want to do I and I know everybody

45
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:10,299
I know what people are writing over here. I don't want to do to start the stream. Central British

46
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:31,299
time. You understand? No. New notifications? No, I want to disable notifications. All right,

47
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:42,700
so let's go to courses and then new courses search. No, no, no. You go to ID, right?

48
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:52,299
That's not going to show if I like ID to everybody, right? No. Okay. What do we do? What

49
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:57,059
are we going to start with? Well, I like your lich. Thanks for the $50 and the five community

50
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:02,809
subs and core monster for the community subs too. All right. This person said I hate German,

51
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:30,340
so we're going to do that one. D6267 searching for course. Reach towards the end to get through the

52
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:43,340
portal. Find the hidden key for for what? How many people have tried this? 20%? That's not many.

53
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:57,620
All right. By the way, I'm doing strict vetoes this stream. If I don't if I'm not this is not

54
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,980
to say that anybody's levels are not good. I need to warm up first. I know I quit.

55
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:08,200
What was this one again? I don't know. I got a lot. I'm not ready. I haven't played in like two

56
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,879
weeks. Okay, no, I'm fine. I haven't played Mario in like two and a half weeks. Last time I played

57
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:24,139
was last time you saw me streaming. I'm not ready. I don't know the controls to Mario.

58
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:43,799
Do I have to find the hidden key? This is a trick. This is a trick. Well, it's too quiet. I don't

59
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:56,809
like how quiet this one is. It's silent. Oh no. No, you can't just run and jump. You have to like

60
00:11:56,809 --> 00:12:16,120
walk turn 180. Jump. Twist. They added a twist. Oh, fuck. Wait, did the dog just? No, I can't. How

61
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:24,169
do I get over there? Why am I toad? I don't know. I didn't pick this. Did I pick this?

62
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:41,559
I did pick this, didn't I? I think it's gonna pick it up. Does that make the door up here?

63
00:12:42,360 --> 00:13:01,139
Holy shit. What happened? It's a P door. Oh, okay. How do I get up there? Oh, I kind of like this one.

64
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:11,269
It's kind of scary, but it's fun. This is more of a walker than a runner.

65
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:29,419
Anything over here? What is that? I don't know. I don't know. I'm gone. Oh, that's a checkpoint.

66
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:43,190
Whoa. Whoa. By the way, this is going to be a not angry one. I know that if you're watching

67
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:47,590
these streams and you've watched me play Mario Maker like twice before, right now you're just

68
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:53,340
like, oh man, I can't wait to literally like start to say like mean things about video games. No,

69
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,539
I'm in too good of a mood. I got a locked in date of September 21st

70
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,659
for that carnival stream. Nothing can anger me today.

71
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:15,509
It's not going to make me. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm doing fine. I feel great.

72
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:29,500
Nothing's going to like bring me down. I should have seen that. I thought it was just spikes on

73
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:49,259
the wall. You're the best around. Thanks. Appreciate that. Now what? Ooh, I didn't even.

74
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:01,000
I have to read this.

75
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:13,509
Thank you door cube for the 250. We usually don't read bits like this early here, but they said,

76
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:19,590
how did you get the carnival stream off the ground this quick? But it's been years since you promised

77
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:29,080
a Noah's Ark toothbrush merch. Well, that's easy because it's impossible to find a company that's

78
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:35,580
going to manufacture custom toothbrushes for you. That doesn't exist. We're going to call Colgate.

79
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:47,370
Dear Colgate, can you make like 1200 toothbrushes for me? Or am I going to buy a bunch of blue

80
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:54,340
toothbrushes over a year from like CVS, the ones that have no brand on them, stockpile,

81
00:15:54,340 --> 00:16:02,090
like 5,000 of them, and then just resell them. Isn't that as illegal? Isn't that against the law?

82
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:18,360
Oh shit. I'm dead. What? Oh, this is going to be hard. Hey, you're the lawyer here.

83
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:24,230
I skimmed it. I think that's like, no, no, no, you can. But isn't that like mean?

84
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:32,340
Let's say I buy a CVS blue toothbrush for a dollar and then I sell that CVS blue toothbrush

85
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,820
for $10. There's no like government agency that's going to get involved and go like,

86
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:48,360
hey, these are a dollar. What happened? All right. I got to be ready for this.

87
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:53,769
Drop it. Oh shit. I'm dead. It's guaranteed to lose here. Guaranteed.

88
00:16:53,769 --> 00:17:15,690
I got to stand up on the slow down. Don't go too fast. Oh my God. I went too fast.

89
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:24,730
All right. So I got to bait the first one and then jump over the second one or just jump from,

90
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,259
give these livid right now. Yeah. So I got to get this one to drop before it gets over here.

91
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:45,799
Same thing. Get it to drop, drop, drop, drop. Holy shit. Now what, now what do I do? Oh fuck.

92
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:56,710
Give me a checkpoint. Oh, I hate this. No checkpoint or anything. I don't, is it safe

93
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:11,500
to fall down here? I'm going to get trolled. This is going to be, oh, now go over here.

94
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:20,180
There's going to be something on the ceiling. I just know there is. This is going to be something

95
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:35,670
in that, in that thing's arm. Does not. Okay. I just needed to know. If I jumped into that,

96
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:43,559
it would have been horrible. Slow down. If I was a Mario maker level maker, I would put just

97
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:51,240
something to kill me right there. Just, just for me to walk into. I'm this far. I don't want to

98
00:18:51,240 --> 00:19:13,420
blow it for a second. I thought I was making that music. All right. This is too deliberate to have

99
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:22,980
there not be something wrong here. Ah, I told you. I fucking told, what did I tell you? Look.

100
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:46,730
Oh shit. I probably shouldn't have done that. Where are they coming from? Where are they coming

101
00:19:46,730 --> 00:20:06,180
from? Where are the football helmets coming from? Oops. Should I not have done that? Oh no. Okay.

102
00:20:06,259 --> 00:20:16,009
Should I hit this one too? I feel like I should hit this one. I can get it. No, there's one right

103
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:23,690
here. Hit this one, I think. I don't know. I don't know. I don't like this one. This one's too,

104
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:28,089
it's, it's very deliberate and I like just running straight really fast.

105
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:47,589
Okay. Is that it? Don't blow it. That needs, oh, that needs a key. That needs a key to the key.

106
00:20:47,589 --> 00:21:07,769
Where's the key? Oh, please respawn over here. Thank God. Wait, what? I did it. I did it. Okay.

107
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:23,130
Key to the true ending. I don't need, I don't get true endings. That was fun.

108
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:38,900
That was a little scary. Why? Wasn't it? All right, we'll grab this one. This level,

109
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:44,259
this level was made for fun and not to be mean to you. All right. Well, what is the over-under

110
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:52,619
that this is mean to me? I wonder. Hey, I promised this level was not made to be mean to you.

111
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:59,849
Why do I have to say that? Why can't you just, you know, hey, here's a level, man. Check it out.

112
00:22:07,589 --> 00:22:15,819
Oh, maybe he doesn't know my face. All right. Four minutes. Fire Flower Skies one one.

113
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:26,950
Okay. Let's try it. It's going to be a German short spelled in blocks.

114
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:44,099
It's too hard. All right. Well, I got it. I got it. That's good. I got over the guy with the stereo.

115
00:22:48,789 --> 00:23:02,920
Turn this way. Right. Got it. Bingo. Shit. Okay. Oh, I can get up there and get that 50.

116
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:19,269
I got to get two. Come on. They weren't lying. This is a fun one. You got, you're playing to my like

117
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:35,670
addicting shit that I do. Okay. No, it's not worth it. I might die if this goes down all the way.

118
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:39,109
I thought that was gonna just kill me. All right. Give me, I need to knock this guy out.

119
00:23:39,990 --> 00:24:10,890
Ooh, how do I get the key? Uh-oh. Is it gonna be tough? Uh, what? Feels good when you get a nice

120
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:32,519
string. You can lay a nice volley back and forth. Well, can I bring one of you? It's all right.

121
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:44,680
Too much weight. That's not it, is it? Is there weight in Mario? That's definitely not weight.

122
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:56,180
Oh my god. You got me. You fucked me up with the whole weight comment. I'm trying to like jump

123
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:09,500
lighter because like maybe I weigh more. This, they don't have like weight classes in this. Toad

124
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:33,609
is like shorter and fatter. How did I get over there the first time? Toad has good acceleration

125
00:25:33,609 --> 00:25:47,130
but bad turning? Is he a fucking car? What are you talking about? Wait, what? That's not real.

126
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:59,319
Yeah, Mario's got really good handling, but his brakes are always like kind of shitty.

127
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:14,890
All right, get me up there. He's automatic. I'm just gonna carry this. Get out. Okay. All right.

128
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:31,420
Excuse me. What happened there? Did he escape from my grasp? I have to go like this. No, I don't.

129
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:51,700
Okay. Um, uh-oh. Why did I do that? Do I have to go down? Okay, I gotta go down.

130
00:26:52,980 --> 00:27:03,299
Holy shit. Okay, I got it. Give me that spring. I thought that was a hole.

131
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:15,799
I thought that was a hole. I thought that was a hole. I thought it was a hole. Like I'm explaining

132
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:32,059
the funny fucking, hold on. Oh, nothing has got that handling. Fuck. It's all right. I know how

133
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:52,220
to get down there. I almost missed it. You think everything is a hole. I have to think everything

134
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:58,279
is a hole. I'm playing Super Mario. Wait a minute. Is there a secret? Maybe I can jump up there?

135
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:06,069
Why am I, why am I storing them? This is bad. Why did I do that?

136
00:28:06,069 --> 00:28:23,960
Uh-oh. My thumb got cold. Oh my god. Why is my thumb so cold? Okay, I might have to do like a few

137
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:40,859
push-ups. I'm not kidding. I guess I have blood in my hands. I'm telling you. I have to get blood

138
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:52,460
in my hand. I'm freezing. My hands are turning into ice. Oh, I'm gonna fall. Stop laughing.

139
00:28:56,539 --> 00:29:05,660
Well, okay. I know that's there. Oh my god. No. My hands are freezing. They're turning like stone.

140
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:25,109
Every time I move my fingers like I hear like crack and my fans crack. This happens to me

141
00:29:25,109 --> 00:29:32,200
sometimes. Does this happen to anybody else? I get like bad circulation in my hands. Oh my god. I'm

142
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:42,460
gonna fucking not get angry because today nothing's gonna make me angry today. Nothing's gonna make me

143
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:52,339
mad today. You know what today is? September 21st. Well today's not, that's not what today's

144
00:29:52,339 --> 00:30:08,779
date is. Oh my goodness gracious. It's okay. I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go put like my hands in the

145
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:29,779
microwave. Just for like two seconds. Oh, I gotta go get that stupid thing. All right, I'm good.

146
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:44,809
Let me just do this. All right, I just did a person microwave right here. That's a little

147
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:57,559
bit better. Turn down my AC. All right, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna even go that way. What's the

148
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:03,319
point? To get the secret true ending? We don't get true endings on this screen. A lot of you know

149
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:14,519
that by now. Hold on, this is interesting. I'm gonna, I guess I'm gonna go this way.

150
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:29,609
Ooh, all right, hold on. What's over here? You know, I only get bad endings? That's not true.

151
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:40,779
I'm gonna wait for another one. I even said it out loud. You heard me say it out loud. I said it out

152
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:47,019
fucking loud. I said it out loud. Slow down, Jeremy. I said it out loud. Why did I not do it?

153
00:31:47,980 --> 00:32:11,910
I got impatient in three seconds. How is that possible? Oh god. Yeah, I know, right?

154
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:28,039
Don't worry, it's been salvaged. It's okay. I can dark souls them. Wait, that doesn't happen in

155
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:37,480
dark souls. That's all that was over here? What? That has to be more. Oh my god. I didn't know

156
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:51,700
that fire coming out of that shit. What do I do? Over to the right? I'm not stuck in here, am I?

157
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:22,710
No. What? There has to be a way. No, there has to be a way. There's got to be like a secret block or

158
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:41,369
there's got to be something hidden. Damn it. Oh, that was tricky too. Damn it. That was...

159
00:33:45,059 --> 00:34:00,150
It's all right. I can... I know... This one's tricky. I'll tell you, this one... I wouldn't

160
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:09,980
put this one... This one's not hard. It's tricky. God damn it. Give me another one.

161
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:28,139
He's balding so hard. All right, you guys gotta tell me. Am I missing something on Twitch?

162
00:34:29,769 --> 00:34:39,460
That's like a... Oh, he's like bald. He's like mad. You're not bald because you're mad. You're mad

163
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:44,340
because you're bald. Don't you understand? That's not... You guys got it in the reverse.

164
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:11,210
He's scalding. Easy. All right, the last... There's a hard jump over here. Once you get across,

165
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:38,340
you get to jump and then hit... Hold on. That would explain my internet rant? I don't do

166
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:44,170
internet rants. What? That's what I was talking about. That's the jump I was talking about.

167
00:35:44,809 --> 00:36:02,099
I have to get it. What is it? Bang, bang, bang. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. I can't see from

168
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:13,900
here. Did I just almost get fucking hit by that thing? What do I do? Okay. Huh? I can't go

169
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:42,340
underneath this. I can't go this way. The way? I'm not gonna go down to the right. I don't...

170
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,320
He's faking it. What are you... Wait, wait, wait. What are you talking about?

171
00:36:48,889 --> 00:37:00,860
How... The vine. What do you mean the vine? Oh shit. Okay. Watch out. Like I said, that guy's

172
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:09,050
good stuff. What does it throw at? Is it gonna hit me? No, it's not. Oh shit. This is gonna be

173
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:24,599
terrible. I gotta get up. Oh no. I have time. What's my time? No, this should be unlimited time in

174
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:50,730
Mario Maker. What happened? They hit the skybox? What happened? Oh, he... All right. I gotta go

175
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:56,489
quick. I can't just dick around. Let's go. I know where I need to go. Over to the right is just

176
00:37:56,570 --> 00:38:22,440
getting baited. Go to acceleration. Bad balding. You're all gonna be fucking bald, all right?

177
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:28,840
I got news for all you young kids here. You're all gonna be bald. All of you. And it happens to

178
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:34,280
everybody. So you can just stare down that highway knowing that you're gonna drive down that road

179
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:42,119
eventually. You're all gonna be bald. All of you. Do you hear my voice? I've been talking a lot

180
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:51,050
recently. I've got a lot of... I can't, man. All right. Ravraw just gave 10 community subs. Thank you.

181
00:38:52,579 --> 00:39:04,840
Thanks for the 10 subs. That really was an old man yell. I need to like work on that.

182
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:17,800
You're all gonna be bald. I can't wait like 30 years from now. How old am I gonna be? Like 75?

183
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:34,760
I'm gonna be like 96. Lying in my deathbed. And like Twitch 2 will be out by then. And fucking

184
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:46,250
super DX, Degeneration X 49222. You're gonna be streaming right there. You in the chat.

185
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:52,409
Gotta set bald like 10 times. I'm gonna be watching your channel while you're spreading

186
00:39:52,409 --> 00:39:56,650
fingers through your hair. Going, I don't understand. Like I'm... This wasn't like this

187
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:03,130
like a few years ago. And people get in the chat gonna be like, haha bald! Bald! And I'm gonna be

188
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:26,730
lying on my bed just going like... You fucker. I told you. At least I'll get to see it. I'll at

189
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:39,800
least get to see it. Finally, I can die in peace. One of my Twitch chatters is bald now.

190
00:40:42,889 --> 00:40:46,489
What about the... Grandpa, what about your will? You didn't sign that yet.

191
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:37,099
Make sure you skim the will first. I'm not gonna hold on to this thing for that one.

192
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:44,260
Why do I hold on to these guys? What did I just... I just like set that guy up to kill me later.

193
00:41:48,389 --> 00:42:01,059
What was over here? Oh shit. I don't know. I'm going this way. Ooh, fire. Wait, can Toad do fire

194
00:42:01,059 --> 00:42:09,340
in canon? He's not like worthy to eat the fire flower, right? Only like Mario and Luigi can eat

195
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:26,969
these. It's like the hammer. All right, I gotta get down here. I'm not sure what that did. Do I

196
00:42:26,969 --> 00:42:32,949
actually have to carry that all the way over here? Uh oh, I think I do. Don't do that to me.

197
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:58,090
I gotta jump. Jump off the... Oh god. No, come on. No. No. Come here.

198
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:05,510
Do you remember the door? I'm okay. I'm fine. What do you mean the door? No, I don't have the key.

199
00:43:06,469 --> 00:43:10,679
I don't have the key. I don't have the key. Pause it. I don't have the key. What are you talking

200
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:48,809
about? Low door. Go right. The bottom... What? Oh god. Key! Uh oh. I have 38 seconds to get down

201
00:43:48,809 --> 00:44:16,869
this. It's a fucking maze. What is that? I freaked out. It's all right. I'm starting right here.

202
00:44:16,869 --> 00:44:34,420
Oh, thank god. Got the checkpoint. That's all that matters. Oh, the top has spikes too.

203
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:56,019
Huh? Is Bowser here somewhere? What do I need to break? Blocks? I'm confused. Up? Around?

204
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:06,250
When I just see the Bowser face take over your screen, that means that he's here.

205
00:45:06,809 --> 00:45:32,440
Isn't that what that means? Ah, what? Come on. I hit that. Don't blow up on me. No.

206
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:50,860
Welp, the ice. Does this work? Oh, it does. Okay. All right. I thought I... All right. I'm fine.

207
00:45:51,500 --> 00:46:01,420
I should make a kai emote. Yeah, I just think I'm making a kai emote.

208
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:27,989
Just... All right. Spit it out. What does that do for me if I do that? What does this do?

209
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:53,420
Okay, easy. It's slippery. Just drop down? Where does this go? Oh, that was the top, right?

210
00:46:54,619 --> 00:47:09,670
So I can walk around it. I get it. This is a good one. I like this one. This is a good one.

211
00:47:10,389 --> 00:47:38,710
Who made this? I did. So now I can go underneath, right? Um, get out of here. Hold on. Wait.

212
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:46,710
How do I get out from under this? Oh, no. I'm just like those two. They must have done the same thing.

213
00:47:55,030 --> 00:48:02,420
You know, I'm so focused on... Can I just jump over the top of this? All right. How do I die?

214
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:21,909
How do I die? Bombs can break the wooden blocks. Oh, God. Give me a break. Um,

215
00:48:22,789 --> 00:48:26,469
what do you guys want to do for 200 seconds? Because I'm not starting over.

216
00:48:27,429 --> 00:48:52,969
Wait, hold on. How do I die? Is this... Is this synced up? Let's do a test. Ready?

217
00:48:55,289 --> 00:49:07,829
How about this? Ready? Like, you should be hearing like... Is that synced?

218
00:49:08,389 --> 00:49:32,920
Is it? Okay, good. Let's see if I can do like a beat. It's too hard to do with these buttons.

219
00:49:33,559 --> 00:50:05,800
Faster. I wonder how fast I can do it. This is what it's like to be in like jail here.

220
00:50:07,639 --> 00:50:11,079
Just comb my hair for a little bit. I can't hit star button. I'm sorry.

221
00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:25,510
Just die. I can't die. If I die, I start at the beginning. Erasable pen erasers to do fast on the

222
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:29,880
buttons. I've never heard of that technique. You can restart it without losing progress.

223
00:50:30,760 --> 00:51:18,099
Are you serious? No, I can't. No, I definitely can't. Come on! Hurry up! Tell a joke. What do

224
00:51:18,099 --> 00:51:24,889
you want me to say? What joke do I have right now? Besides, I can't leave the level and I can't die.

225
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:41,210
What am I supposed to say? All right. I'm an observational comedyist, so

226
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:54,260
let me... We got two turnip people, right? The ice underneath us. I'm stuck in between here.

227
00:51:55,059 --> 00:52:04,440
What's an observation that I can say about this? There's nothing. There's nothing to say. I'm just

228
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:13,380
inside of the... I'm soft-locked in the game. I have nothing to say. I got it right at zero.

229
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:24,150
We're hemorrhaging viewers. That's all right. They'll be back right now. Ready?

230
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:34,780
Once I beat this first try. Three, two, one, go. I told you they'll... Look, they're back already.

231
00:52:35,340 --> 00:53:14,139
They're already here. Come on, blow up. Oh, nice. Anything up here? How do I get up there?

232
00:53:14,139 --> 00:53:19,460
Okay, I'm good. See, they're back. Look, we just went up by like eight viewers. Those eight people

233
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:54,059
came back. Checkpoint. Yes, we're good. That's what you got to do. Oops. Oops.

234
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:03,289
Watch out. Okay, we're good. This is a long one, but this one doesn't feel long. It feels

235
00:54:03,289 --> 00:54:10,940
like it was very well thought of. And what am I supposed to do about this? Will they go up if I

236
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:29,079
jump? Uh, kind of. Oh, right. I forgot this is Super Mario. He doesn't know. He doesn't even know.

237
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:49,000
Oh my god, he doesn't know. Yes, I do. I know everything. Do the Peter Griffin laugh. Why on

238
00:54:49,000 --> 00:55:17,400
earth would I do that right now? There it is. I'm not gonna do the Peter Griffin laugh. That was

239
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:32,389
good. Good level. One percent completion rate. Is that me doing all those attempts? No, it's not.

240
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:48,539
Need the Peter. I can't even do a Peter Griffin laugh. Pick this one. Pick this one. This one.

241
00:55:48,539 --> 00:56:19,659
This one. This one. Try my level. You got it. Do this one. M0430R9TH. Did I do that wrong?

242
00:56:19,659 --> 00:56:42,730
Was it an O instead of a zero? What just happened? That was a fucking prank level? Are you serious?

243
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:54,809
I don't even. Why? What? How would that be a prank level that says like

244
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:13,579
moth? I don't understand. Oh my god, please. Why? All right, I'm doing this one. All right,

245
00:57:13,579 --> 00:57:25,590
set me real shit by the way. I don't want to like put in your fucking joke code. No joke codes. Is

246
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:37,610
this a joke code? No, it's not. Wide to pinwheel. A lot of swinging. Also watch your jumps. Good luck.

247
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:49,300
All right, let's do it. I mean, it's not a joke code, but it might be a joke level.

248
00:57:49,940 --> 00:58:13,349
It's an auto scroller too. Oh, it's pinwheels. I get it. Oh, the top. I didn't even pay attention

249
00:58:13,349 --> 00:58:23,909
to the top. Sorry. Oh, I didn't. How did I not? What's going on? What is going on with my fucking

250
00:58:23,909 --> 00:58:30,630
hands? Why did I? I'm trying to jump off the damn thing. That's gonna make me angry today.

251
00:58:31,269 --> 00:58:49,989
Boost through the whole thing. I'm just gonna damage boost through the whole thing next time too.

252
00:58:50,789 --> 00:59:17,480
Don't go too high. Oh no. How am I gonna? All right, yeah, damage frames. Let's go. You get a

253
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:35,699
mushroom over there anyways. Not fast enough. Not fast enough apparently. Hey, by the way,

254
00:59:35,699 --> 00:59:52,340
did I tell you? September 21st. Put the date on your calendar. Why? What? Is it like a sinking issue

255
00:59:52,340 --> 01:00:13,820
here with the wireless controller here? I don't get it. All right, just go.

256
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:27,289
We talked about this last time on the last Mario Mega stream, but the easiest way to make any

257
01:00:27,289 --> 01:00:35,130
streamer really, really upset and mad and annoyed is telling them that when they're losing,

258
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:42,409
like, stop pretending. It's like, even though I know you're fucking around, like, it's like,

259
01:00:42,409 --> 01:00:47,530
I'm not pretending. It's like, oh, he has to be pretending. He can't be this stupid.

260
01:00:50,039 --> 01:00:58,360
That's like, every, I don't care who they are. Every single streamer on Twitch, when they see

261
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:05,860
though that phrase, what is he pretending again, is like, hey, I'm not pretending. It doesn't matter

262
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:22,860
if it's fake. Let's go this way. No, that's just a coin over there, right? That was not worth it

263
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:34,170
because how am I going to get back? Just go up? I don't know if I can do that from here.

264
01:01:34,889 --> 01:01:50,900
Going across? Oh, man. Okay, that's pretty cool. All right, I did, I don't know why I thought that

265
01:01:50,900 --> 01:02:22,389
was going to stop. Points. Okay, so I know where to go from here. Now, can I even do this?

266
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:32,010
While being big? It's harder. Can I have somebody in the chat explain to me why that didn't catch

267
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:43,619
twice? I didn't do anything. Why didn't I, why did I not catch? Because I was invincible?

268
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:52,150
No, I clearly was in there. Can you not get grabbed when you're invincible?

269
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:09,909
All right, that's all right. I want to be small anyways. What was that? I had no momentum.

270
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:22,440
I do like this one, though.

271
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:39,989
We're good. All right, so it's gonna be tough to actually jump over this.

272
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:54,579
I got it. Okay. And then up and then over. And then from here. Oh, too tall. Watch it. Okay,

273
01:03:54,579 --> 01:04:16,059
this is this part. Fire down there. I think I have to run across this. I need a running start.

274
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:33,480
I did it. Cool. Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, it is the auto scroll portion.

275
01:04:34,619 --> 01:04:49,099
Uh, all right. I'm gonna go, uh, I'm gonna go right. Left side. I like how there's two different

276
01:04:49,099 --> 01:05:13,719
ways to go. Oh, come on. I don't know where I am. I really probably needed that. Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

277
01:05:13,719 --> 01:05:23,670
Thank god I got it correct. And then up. Let's see. It's up and then right. What about this one?

278
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:37,960
Ooh, easy. Which way? Which way do I need to be? I don't know. I have to take a guess. Uh,

279
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:53,739
I went right last time. We're gonna go left. Got it right. I don't care about the coins.

280
01:05:54,300 --> 01:06:22,780
Okay, stop. Ah! Okay, I'm fine. Can I? Are those platforms? Are they? Hold on. Oh, no. Not

281
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:28,139
another one of these. Another one of these. Where is it going? Oh, fuck. Okay, hold on.

282
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:37,780
I just panicked. Ah! Um, up. Is there another one firing on anywhere? Where's the other one?

283
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:51,460
There's one right here! Which way? Um, is there anything up? Still? Nope. Go. Oh, please. Okay.

284
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:59,400
What? No. Oh, god. No. I have to jump this. Let me take a look at what it looks like.

285
01:07:00,199 --> 01:07:03,800
It's just... I need to jump from where that coin is. That's definitely what it means.

286
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:20,139
Run? Jump at this platform across. Hold your breath. Oh! Okay. And then... Shit. I think I need

287
01:07:20,139 --> 01:07:28,579
to momentum here. I need to do a jump-jump, don't I? I'm not gonna make that. I need to be going as

288
01:07:28,579 --> 01:07:41,099
fast with that first jump. Shit. Okay. Ah! Up? I think I'm gonna go up. Watch out for the saw.

289
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:47,940
Oh, god. Come on. No, there's only, like, a coin up here. I don't want to go up here anymore.

290
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:55,369
I don't want to go up here anymore. No. I don't want to do this hard jump. I need to... I'm dead.

291
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:07,300
I think it's peak of that jump. Holy shit! I'm okay. And then, but how do I get over this one?

292
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:16,390
I'm gonna hit it, aren't I? Ah! Does this move? Does this move? Does anyone know if that moves?

293
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:28,859
Is this gonna come up? I'm terrified. Did they come up? I did it. Game over. That was fun.

294
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:48,939
Can I breathe now? Yes, you can. Let's give that one eye. Nice job. He stopped pretending.

295
01:08:49,659 --> 01:09:14,380
Sometimes you gotta pretend. What an actor. Uh, you won't pick this one. Um, yes, I will. Uh-oh,

296
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:24,199
people are starting to understand how to game my brain. You have to just put a sad face.

297
01:09:28,579 --> 01:09:32,500
I have the last two or three that I've done have been, you're not gonna play mine with a sad face,

298
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:38,680
and I'm like, yeah, I will. Of course I will. Here you go, man. Uh, this is called Monty Symbiosis.

299
01:09:39,239 --> 01:09:42,439
Monty Balls have teamed up with Piranha Plants. Show evolution whose boss it is.

300
01:09:43,319 --> 01:10:03,000
You can do this apparently in a minute. Okay. This is a hard one. This is World 1-1.

301
01:10:07,609 --> 01:10:19,770
Oh, all right. Is there a mushroom? Is that gonna hurt me? Well, that's an easy 10 point.

302
01:10:20,970 --> 01:10:25,689
What's in here? All right. Oh, just getting all the secrets in this one.

303
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:38,819
I'm not gonna admin me. No. Oh, shit. You just, I can't be on the ground. Oh, this is gonna be

304
01:10:38,819 --> 01:11:05,500
terrible. Okay. Watch out for those hidden blocks. Don't touch the ground. That's the name of the

305
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:15,260
game. I can touch the ground for a second. Okay. I know this one right here now, so that's good.

306
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:26,920
I don't have to sit there and freak out about mushrooms. That hitbox was dog shit, I will tell

307
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:51,619
you. Up. I feel like I want to get in there. No. Fireballs? Oh, God. Okay. They come out.

308
01:11:51,619 --> 01:11:58,060
Give me that, please. Uh, wait. Come back. Come back, come back, come back, come back, come back.

309
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:07,340
Come, and I'll be back eventually. Don't worry. I've, no, no, no. Connect that because I,

310
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:10,060
that needs to come back. I need, I want to, whatever this is I want it. It's not coming

311
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:33,460
back, is it? Yeah, I can die faster than it will come back. Should I go up? Why would that vine be

312
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:48,699
there? I thought it was going to go up somewhere. All right, now switch it. Watch out for the fire.

313
01:12:50,520 --> 01:13:11,539
Do they all have fire? Is that going to, just don't move. Uh oh, uh oh. Don't move. What? I,

314
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:24,460
damage boost ruined the whole thing. I don't know why I wanted to do that so bad, but I had to.

315
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:43,430
That was a good one. I didn't see them. They blended the fuck in real good. I was not paying

316
01:13:43,430 --> 01:13:49,430
attention to that. He's not, I, whatever. I'm telling you right now, that was legitimate.

317
01:13:51,460 --> 01:14:12,539
I thought they were grass. I thought they were grass. I have to jump. No, it's going to hit me.

318
01:14:12,539 --> 01:14:25,319
It's going to double tap me. Stop. Oh, all right, I'm fine. Jump over the grass. Wait, I could,

319
01:14:25,319 --> 01:14:44,199
there probably was a block. No true endings. Only bad endings here, guys. That was a fun one. Nice.

320
01:14:45,159 --> 01:14:53,909
Good level. You are going to play this one. Yes, I am. Yes, I will play this one. Make sure it's

321
01:14:53,909 --> 01:15:19,829
not like a poopy to poo. Maneuvering Bob-ombs. This is new. No one's played this one in the world,

322
01:15:19,829 --> 01:15:24,739
probably besides me. It's a puzzle level, so I'm going to have a lot of fun with this one.

323
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:30,779
For a second, I thought my intro was still playing in the background. I was like,

324
01:15:30,779 --> 01:15:44,069
how the hell did nobody tell me this yet? All right, obviously the bomb to explode this guy.

325
01:15:44,869 --> 01:15:52,199
Now we need the bomb to hit the switch. Yep, okay, and we have to have you come down. Take

326
01:15:52,199 --> 01:16:02,779
the bomb with us over here. All right, there's more bombs. So we got to do, put the bomb up there,

327
01:16:03,579 --> 01:16:11,319
and it's got to hit it. Hit the switch. That was a little too early. Might still do it. No. Oh,

328
01:16:11,399 --> 01:16:18,119
yeah. Hold on. One, two, three, four, five. Okay, it's been five seconds. How long? One,

329
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:26,579
two. So in three seconds, I have to get it over there. So we go one, two, three, one.

330
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:58,840
Law. Come on. Stop, stop, stop. One, two, three, two, two, three, one, two. What?

331
01:17:02,010 --> 01:17:34,970
Put it on. No. Did I use them all? He's baiting help donations. I don't have like text to speech

332
01:17:34,970 --> 01:17:39,369
on. If anything, like a help donation would be worse because I have to look over here.

333
01:17:40,170 --> 01:17:52,869
And now what? Wait, wait, wait. What do I have to? You motherfucker. I didn't think two more than

334
01:17:52,869 --> 01:18:02,069
two could be out at one time. I thought like only two could be out at one time. I remember because

335
01:18:02,069 --> 01:18:18,539
it was... That's going to hit me. It's going to hit me still. Get up there. Hurry. I like this one.

336
01:18:19,989 --> 01:18:31,210
What are you thinking? Pretending to be like mad for donations. I don't get it. I don't understand.

337
01:18:31,210 --> 01:18:44,170
What are you talking about? Somebody donate and like tell me. I don't get it. I'm so stupid.

338
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:55,020
Talking about donations is baiting donations. Don't you know, even if you say the word donation,

339
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:15,100
but I need to have like banned words as a streamer. Donation prime. Why did I do that?

340
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:31,460
No, no, it's going to kill it. It's a key. See what I'm talking about? I can't say those words.

341
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:38,619
I cannot say the word prime. I can't say it because Herbert just gave 25 subs. Holy shit.

342
01:19:38,619 --> 01:19:47,989
You see what I'm saying? That's a lot of subs. Thank you, Herbert. That's fucking too many.

343
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:52,659
And then LaCrona just gave $65. Do you understand? I need to have like...

344
01:19:54,260 --> 01:20:01,300
I can't say the word money on stream. LaCrona, thanks with 65 bucks and Herbert for the 25 subs.

345
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:09,289
Greedy streamer sucks money out of wallet of innocent streamer. Okay, I'm never going to say

346
01:20:09,289 --> 01:20:15,930
the word money again on stream. Anytime I want, I'm going to talk about like capital or

347
01:20:19,369 --> 01:20:26,810
paper trading goods. That's what I'm going to say. Monthly paper trading goods subscription.

348
01:20:26,810 --> 01:20:35,050
All right, so I need to stop that from coming down, but it kills it.

349
01:20:35,050 --> 01:20:44,840
It's got to be there long enough for it to explode. All right, so hold on. Ready?

350
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:59,609
Go. No, what? Why does it not stay on top of it? It can't. Ban the word pretending.

351
01:21:00,329 --> 01:21:09,579
That's not reaching it. It looks like it's reaching it.

352
01:21:18,630 --> 01:21:29,399
Fuck. I'm not acting. Yes, I am. I'm a fucking actor. This is a puzzle one. You're not supposed

353
01:21:29,399 --> 01:21:47,050
to beat this one quick. How long does this travel over there? You have to go like...

354
01:21:48,090 --> 01:22:05,979
No, no, way earlier than that. Jesus. Now what? Oh, that hurts. Oh, you got to crane this. Come

355
01:22:05,979 --> 01:22:10,760
on over here. Drop it. Holy shit, this is going to be horrible. All right, stay over here.

356
01:22:17,979 --> 01:22:25,399
Can I just throw it in? There's too many of them. This whole thing is going to get

357
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:31,159
messed up here. I can't go over here. I can no longer jump over here. What do I do? What do I

358
01:22:31,159 --> 01:22:48,439
do about this? There's too many. Okay, shit. How many do you think I can have over here?

359
01:22:48,439 --> 01:22:53,579
I'm not playing that game right now. I'm playing the try to win. I don't like it to come out so

360
01:22:53,579 --> 01:23:06,020
fast. All right, this next one I'm going to try. Come here. Ready? I should get it now.

361
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:16,260
Get it. Drop it over here quick. Oh, come on. That was the one. You got to get it when it's on

362
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:37,319
its way this way. Get it. Oh, like how far is it? How far does it go? Easy. No.

363
01:23:39,479 --> 01:24:01,430
Please. Okay. Grab one. No. YouTuber scream. That was a gasping for air. I didn't scream.

364
01:24:02,069 --> 01:24:29,100
Oh my God, please. All right. Wait. Grab it. Drop it. Please mom.

365
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:45,319
I have to like put it pushed down. What am I supposed to do?

366
01:24:47,880 --> 01:25:29,800
Put that helmet on. Can I pick it up? I can't pick it up. Do I have to bounce it with my head?

367
01:25:43,079 --> 01:25:50,760
Okay. Well, I don't even know that. Okay. This is like the second time I've played Mario Maker

368
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:55,590
in like three weeks. I don't know you could do this shit. I thought I was just going to go

369
01:25:56,390 --> 01:26:17,659
and explode. Oops. Fuck. It's actually kind of hard. Oh no. Give me another one.

370
01:26:22,699 --> 01:26:36,579
You said you knew everything. Nobody can know everything. I'm facing the right side.

371
01:26:36,579 --> 01:27:14,949
I'm facing to the right. Do we die already? More than three. Interesting. Four? More than five times?

372
01:27:14,949 --> 01:27:38,659
It's not going to be eight. God. Fuck me. Why? No. Don't. Please. I don't want to do this again.

373
01:27:39,460 --> 01:28:01,399
I really, I don't want to do this again. Oh fuck. Die. Guys. What's going on here?

374
01:28:02,359 --> 01:28:31,369
Does this end? Give that to me. Oh my God. This thing's gonna explode. That was a scream.

375
01:28:31,369 --> 01:28:35,529
That was a scream. Yes. You can say I screamed because I did. That was an actual scream.

376
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:51,350
Get me out of here. Excuse me. I really don't want to do that eight more times. So I hope I don't die.

377
01:28:52,149 --> 01:29:06,699
Hey, I'm like five for five right now. That's pretty. I've beaten every level that it's come

378
01:29:06,699 --> 01:29:22,539
across. I haven't vetoed any yet. Uh, 50 more dollars came in from another fan. Three, two, one.

379
01:29:22,539 --> 01:29:30,180
Thank you for the 50 dollars. I'm a dirty YouTube archive watcher. I'm still catching up on your

380
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:34,420
stuff since you stream so often, but it's my dream for you to play one of my levels.

381
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:54,899
And they put their level here. Nobody in chat beat this. Bribery. Well, thank you for the 50

382
01:29:54,899 --> 01:29:58,979
dollars. And I'm going to play your level. I am. I just, what, what do you want me to say?

383
01:30:00,069 --> 01:30:10,460
Guys, give me a break. That was fun. You got bribed and sweet talk. It's really not that hard to

384
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:16,579
make me do something. Well, I mean, that's, that's a lot of money. That's, that is hard.

385
01:30:16,579 --> 01:30:20,470
That's a ton of fucking money. You don't have to pay me money to play your level, but like,

386
01:30:21,029 --> 01:30:53,899
I just saw it. Don't worry. We're going to be here for a while. Don't worry. Bound across

387
01:30:53,899 --> 01:31:01,539
bumpers. Bounce across the desert. Jump right as soon as you land to get extra height. 28 seconds.

388
01:31:01,539 --> 01:31:28,220
Short and sweet. All right. Less than 20 seconds. It's the bumpers. I have a reasonable explanation

389
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:33,180
as to how that happened. I started to burp. I like, I could feel a burp coming out of my stomach

390
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:37,420
and I stopped for a second and just, that's a very reasonable explanation.

391
01:31:37,979 --> 01:31:49,909
Not enough. I'm not pretending. That looked very much like somebody was pretending, but they

392
01:31:49,909 --> 01:31:55,670
weren't. I promise. That looked like it could have, it looked like I just walked into the hole. Like,

393
01:31:55,670 --> 01:32:00,229
oh shit, I, I fell down, but I missed going through the hole. But let me just like nudge

394
01:32:00,229 --> 01:32:05,050
to the left a little. I fell down. But I can assure you, that's not what happened.

395
01:32:05,930 --> 01:32:12,439
How do I get in there? Well, that's how. I like this one. This one's nice and like,

396
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:37,539
cool. Mario three. The best Mario that nobody plays. And what I mean by that is most people

397
01:32:37,539 --> 01:32:41,619
that play Mario three play the first two or three levels and then skip to the end of the game

398
01:32:42,579 --> 01:33:12,539
every time. Oops. It's a great game though. Bounce. Oh my God. What the fuck am I doing?

399
01:33:12,539 --> 01:33:20,329
It's different Mario. It's a different style. That's why I've been, I've been playing. What

400
01:33:20,329 --> 01:33:25,300
was I on before? I was playing a different Mario before. It's a different style and there's

401
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:58,250
different weight. Oh shit. That's a far away. Oh no. Am I in trouble? Why am I commentating

402
01:33:58,250 --> 01:34:07,100
over a 10 year old's gameplay of Mario? It would be an easy string, you know. It's gonna be easy.

403
01:34:20,170 --> 01:34:24,329
Somebody can do that in 28 seconds. Well, that was, that was fun. That was a fun,

404
01:34:24,329 --> 01:34:28,170
just little level. It was fun to play. Thank you for that level. That was another fan.

405
01:34:28,970 --> 01:34:38,100
All right. All right. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. This is says, this one says

406
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:45,930
easy fun hand warmer. I don't know what that means. Oh, right. It was my hands. And then

407
01:34:47,529 --> 01:35:17,829
we'll do slime. We'll do your level right after zero. All right. Mechanism mine. Go through mine

408
01:35:17,829 --> 01:35:26,229
with a fair amount of traps. Puzzle solving standard length. How much money do I have to

409
01:35:26,229 --> 01:35:30,869
pay you to play my level? There is no amount of money that I will take to play level. I just do,

410
01:35:30,869 --> 01:35:34,630
I just do it if it's, if I see it, there's no, you don't have to pay me to play level.

411
01:35:35,270 --> 01:35:39,829
This is the worst Mario ever. This is the worst one. So I already don't like this one because it's

412
01:35:39,829 --> 01:35:59,579
the one that has this. This is literally the best Mario. I'm just kidding guys. My God.

413
01:35:59,579 --> 01:36:05,739
I don't need to make a Dark Souls, Souls born tier list of Mario games. Although might as well.

414
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:28,460
Oh, they're all pretty fun. All the Mario games are fun. They've fun games. They've lasted

415
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:36,970
like 60 years. I can't really think of another product that's been around for that long

416
01:36:37,770 --> 01:37:11,180
that people still like. Cars. Yeah. Okay. So a car has lasted. That's fine. Yes. Oh God. What do

417
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:24,329
I do with this? The TV. The TV has, has the TV been around for 60 years so far? Kind, sort of. Not

418
01:37:24,329 --> 01:37:49,369
really though. Hold on. Like what are the, let's go ahead and do this again. Oh, why have you done

419
01:37:49,369 --> 01:38:13,750
that? Just damn thing. Um, what do I do now? What? Oh, I guess I'm just gonna go, go up.

420
01:38:15,189 --> 01:38:24,890
The TV is so good. Why don't we have TV too? I mean, you're on TV too right now. Can I?

421
01:38:25,850 --> 01:39:09,720
Oh shit. This one's pretty cool. Uh, but how does, what? Key block? That was, that won't,

422
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:27,500
what's going on here? There's no key block. Thought I had it. What the fuck is happening?

423
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:51,399
What? Did I mess it all up back here? Am I missing something? No, I,

424
01:39:51,399 --> 01:40:13,300
that's up here. Is there a key block available? It has to grab that. Okay.

425
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:28,680
I don't, I think I screwed it all up though, didn't I? I think I blew it. I blew it.

426
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:47,720
I'm telling you, I swear to God, people think I'm making this shit up,

427
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:51,880
but sometimes when you press a button on the switch controller, it just like doesn't

428
01:40:51,880 --> 01:41:15,500
happen. It's like a phantom button press. I promise. I'll get it this time.

429
01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:34,069
I, you know, I'm already back down here. It's like it never happened. Oops. Can't do that.

430
01:41:37,130 --> 01:41:47,979
That's, I don't get that. I don't get it. I'm going to not, I won't lie. I don't, I don't,

431
01:41:48,060 --> 01:42:13,500
I don't get it. I don't get that one to clean. Okay. Now I need to, don't get that. Does that

432
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:20,220
despawn? All right. So we've got a scenario where I've got to press the button up there.

433
01:42:20,220 --> 01:42:43,989
Go get this pullback. No, no, no. Oh my God. I still got it. No more screaming. I promise.

434
01:42:43,989 --> 01:43:10,500
What the fuck do I get back up there? No, I have to go all the way up to get the helmet.

435
01:43:21,159 --> 01:43:24,840
I, I'm freaking out. I don't, I don't get it. I'm fucked up. I don't understand. I'm

436
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:36,470
fucking freaking out. Well, I don't know. I just get up here. I, do I not even need the helmet?

437
01:43:48,279 --> 01:43:53,989
I don't think I even need to use the P switch for here. I think I just have to follow it up.

438
01:43:54,789 --> 01:44:13,060
So just take it and then like, can I just get up there? Okay. So this is why I was freaking

439
01:44:13,060 --> 01:44:19,619
out because I don't, I guess I never even needed in the first place. Okay. Let's go.

440
01:44:21,619 --> 01:44:32,069
I need to bring it all the way over there. No, stop picking. Oh my God. I'm going to freak the

441
01:44:32,069 --> 01:44:41,689
fuck out. I need to bring it up all the way. I had to bring it up the whole way, not just right

442
01:44:41,689 --> 01:44:48,680
there. I got to bring up the entire way. How am I going to do that now? How did you get down here?

443
01:45:00,939 --> 01:45:05,260
I, I thought that when it came over here, I could press it. I didn't have to go all the way up.

444
01:45:05,260 --> 01:45:20,500
Okay. So now, wait, what the fuck has happened? What, what does this matter?

445
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:37,420
Do I just do it now? I think do it now, right? Go all the way up. Isn't that going to fuck this up?

446
01:45:56,409 --> 01:46:16,250
Huh? What the fuck? I didn't know something came out of there. I didn't know something came out of

447
01:46:16,250 --> 01:46:22,300
that fucking thing. How was I supposed to know that? I didn't know that a thing came out. That's

448
01:46:22,300 --> 01:46:26,699
why I spent this much time trying to figure out what the hell to do. I didn't know that someone's

449
01:46:26,699 --> 01:46:33,239
going to jump out of there. You can't dock points on my intelligence because I didn't know.

450
01:46:35,640 --> 01:47:06,020
I didn't know like a bomb walked out of that. That was fun though. All right, slime, where's he

451
01:47:06,020 --> 01:47:39,609
going? All right, we're going to do it's time for slime's level. Let's do L6, B6. Let's go. This is

452
01:47:39,609 --> 01:47:46,170
called MarioAntivirus.exe. This one's going to be great. Hackers have broken through Mario's

453
01:47:46,170 --> 01:47:55,239
firewall and infected his PC with bugs. Is that supposed to, is that the Windows logo? That's

454
01:47:55,239 --> 01:48:18,100
awesome. Defeat all 20. Oh, okay. First door? We'll do door one. Oh, it's just there. Is this

455
01:48:18,100 --> 01:48:27,930
supposed to be the computer? Oh no, a P-switch. My worst enemy. Anything else? Let me take this in

456
01:48:27,930 --> 01:48:49,640
for a second though. Anything else over here to look at? No, I just want to see. God. Oh no.

457
01:48:51,640 --> 01:48:56,340
Do I have to fill this in? Any more blocks hidden?

458
01:49:02,329 --> 01:49:33,880
What on earth? Oh, I got four 1-ups. Where do I go from here? Up and around. Oh shit. Okay.

459
01:49:35,479 --> 01:49:51,210
To hit that I think. So let's hit this. Mushroom. Can't hit that. Wait, this is like the microchip.

460
01:49:51,210 --> 01:50:04,439
Okay, I see. So I gotta get all 21? Can I not kill these? I don't think I can, right?

461
01:50:05,159 --> 01:50:20,810
I have to hit the POW, don't I? All right, this is two. I gotta kill these ones. Let's see. There it

462
01:50:20,810 --> 01:50:30,039
is. All right, three, five. How do I get out of here? Let's go all the way to the right.

463
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:36,920
This is big. Holy shit, this is huge. Is that the firewall?

464
01:50:42,899 --> 01:50:49,899
Just leave. I can't just leave. Oh shit, that's gonna be horrible.

465
01:50:50,380 --> 01:51:03,100
Oh, can I? I don't think I can. Should I try it? I don't think I'm ready for that.

466
01:51:03,100 --> 01:51:20,869
Where do you go? Watch out for the icicles. Oh shit, they respawn. It's seven.

467
01:51:23,739 --> 01:51:31,189
I need... Oh, I just like... It's called health, but it is technically health.

468
01:51:38,869 --> 01:51:56,460
Oh, the timer, you're right. Okay, hold on. I'm not gonna do this in time. Oh god,

469
01:51:57,180 --> 01:52:14,619
there's so much more. Get up there. Is there any more down here? To the left?

470
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:25,020
Did I miss any over here? I'm gonna have to do this again. Did I miss any? Nine out of 21 over

471
01:52:25,020 --> 01:52:34,869
here? I think I missed one on the top left. Wasting time? Well, I'm not gonna beat it,

472
01:52:34,869 --> 01:52:48,550
so I might as well just see if there's anything else. Holy shit. Okay. Oh my god.

473
01:52:49,109 --> 01:52:59,289
This is so big. How do I get up here? Off of your head? Give me the... I got a key now.

474
01:53:00,090 --> 01:53:19,590
Can you... I think he has to kill them, doesn't he? No, what? How am I killing them? What was it?

475
01:53:19,590 --> 01:53:29,960
On his head? All right, I'm gonna try this again. This time, I'm not gonna like take in the scenes.

476
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:48,069
It's a very, very pretty level for the first batch. I still don't understand what the point

477
01:53:48,149 --> 01:53:53,430
of that one is. Was that a dev kit? It's probably a dev kit, something like that.

478
01:53:54,229 --> 01:54:01,960
My god. It's okay. Okay, I'm like panicking for no reason. I have like, I have like 12 minutes.

479
01:54:07,130 --> 01:54:27,220
Oh, it's slippery. Shit. Is those two? It is that. Got that. Any more? Shouldn't have done that. That

480
01:54:27,220 --> 01:54:33,180
was a dumb idea, but I did it anyways. Oh, there was, look, there was a secret one over here. See?

481
01:54:35,140 --> 01:54:45,020
Shit, I didn't think that was gonna happen. All right, that's 10. I feel like you just spawned

482
01:54:45,020 --> 01:54:54,039
that in for me. All right, I gotta go through the firewall now. Get through this, though. I'm getting

483
01:54:54,039 --> 01:55:06,119
hit. Through the... I gotta just go. I have to, I gotta go for it. Go for it. Okay, I'm fine.

484
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:17,020
Don't go through this door. Mushroom in here. Now this, this... All right, hold on. What does this do?

485
01:55:17,739 --> 01:55:27,560
I should have known that was gonna fucking happen. Why did I just not understand that?

486
01:55:28,119 --> 01:55:33,819
That's in case you miss one. I get it. I'm gonna go all the way to the right.

487
01:55:35,420 --> 01:55:47,289
Oh my god. Okay, there's all this. Um, did I just get spawned on? What the hell?

488
01:55:48,409 --> 01:55:59,239
Tele-frag. All right, now I know what the door does. I don't even need to grab these. I don't know

489
01:55:59,239 --> 01:56:26,539
what I'm doing. Let's do the skip. Wait till it goes over that way. Got it. There it is. There it is.

490
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:34,149
Don't get that. No reason to. Same thing I did this way. All the way around. Boink.

491
01:56:38,329 --> 01:56:47,979
There it is. Okay, there it is. Ten. No, yes. You hope I'm having a good day? I'm having a good day.

492
01:56:47,979 --> 01:57:05,060
Hope you're having a good day too. How is your day? It's good. Here we go. Man, my brain is too

493
01:57:05,060 --> 01:57:15,750
small for that. All right, let's just do this. Oh my god. No! No! Why? I just wanted this...

494
01:57:17,270 --> 01:57:20,390
All right, I have to get rid of the stupid magician. This magician's pissing me off.

495
01:57:21,189 --> 01:57:33,720
That's the hacker. All right, I got a key. Oh, I got another key. I can do it again.

496
01:57:35,460 --> 01:57:51,220
Two keys. How many? 20. I got 12. I got 21. I got them all. How do I get out of here? What do I have

497
01:57:51,220 --> 01:58:12,810
to do? Is there like an exit door? Pipe. Pipe. Pipe. Pipe. Pipe. Pipe. Pipe. Pipe. Pipe. Like,

498
01:58:12,810 --> 01:58:20,649
where? What do you mean pipe? Pipe? Pipe. Pipe. Pipe. Pipe. Pipe. Pipe. I don't know what you

499
01:58:20,649 --> 01:58:24,569
mean by pipe. Okay, I'm fucking losing my mind. I'm freaking out. The hacker's gonna kill me.

500
01:58:24,569 --> 01:58:48,359
Pipe! I got it. That was cool. That was actually really fun. Really well thought out level. That

501
01:58:48,359 --> 01:59:02,010
was it's time for slime. Good shit. You look lovely today. Oh, okay. Although wait, somebody

502
01:59:02,010 --> 01:59:09,350
has a fish. No, I'm not gonna do that. You look lovely today. Usually the fish gets me,

503
01:59:09,989 --> 01:59:25,449
but today it's all about the compliments that get me today. You have RNG in your name here.

504
01:59:26,840 --> 01:59:47,260
I wonder if that means anything. Jerma's family dinner. You can beat this in seven seconds.

505
01:59:47,260 --> 02:00:37,529
Okay. Should I get the coins? The clown car? All right. It was an easy one. I'm gonna get

506
02:00:37,529 --> 02:01:09,619
the world record on this. Seven seconds. Seven point three. Here we go. Was that longer than

507
02:01:09,619 --> 02:02:10,779
seven seconds? No! That has to be pretty close. What? I just had it. Somebody just got a better

508
02:02:10,779 --> 02:02:33,770
one than I did. What? It was seven three. Now it's seven oh? One more. I don't care. This is it.

509
02:02:33,770 --> 02:02:46,520
Even if it's, uh, I don't think that was the one. Six. No. That was mine was cleaner. But again,

510
02:02:46,520 --> 02:02:59,159
seven one. Seven. No, you guys can fucking fight each other over it. Hey, that was a short and

511
02:02:59,159 --> 02:03:21,539
sweet one. Thank you. Beautiful also. Fuck you. All right. Yeah. Let's do that one. After this,

512
02:03:21,539 --> 02:03:34,810
I'm gonna go pee. Come back and do some more. Mid-airs made easy. These mid-airs require no

513
02:03:34,810 --> 02:03:43,739
kaizo skill. Red pipes provide hints if needed. Oh, this is apparently impossible.

514
02:03:46,170 --> 02:03:55,079
One percent completion rate. Oh, this is gonna be tough. These mid-airs require no kaizo skill.

515
02:03:55,079 --> 02:04:08,920
What? I don't know. I don't know what that means. This is way over my head. Gotta go up here?

516
02:04:09,880 --> 02:04:25,539
I need another. Is this low gravity? What? Okay. Well, that changes everything.

517
02:04:26,420 --> 02:05:01,060
So I have to go up, jump, and grab it, and jump? Throw it over? I don't know. Oh no. Give me that

518
02:05:01,060 --> 02:05:16,579
back. The low gravity just fucked with me. Hold on. All right. So you just throw it out. Jump up

519
02:05:16,579 --> 02:05:24,119
there. No. Why? I don't want to grab the fucking thing. Oh my god. I don't want to grab it. I

520
02:05:24,119 --> 02:05:48,380
wanted this to... Okay. Well, we'll have to start over again. Oh, I didn't have to even go up there.

521
02:05:48,380 --> 02:06:05,539
Okay. Use red pipes for a hint. Well, we don't need one yet. What are these for? I guess. I don't

522
02:06:05,539 --> 02:06:23,800
know. I have to definitely jump up on this. It resets the level. Oh, okay. Is this autoscrolling?

523
02:06:25,189 --> 02:06:25,829
Wait, hold on.

524
02:06:31,819 --> 02:06:42,859
Get up there. Okay. And then, oh yeah, yay. Okay. Now fall through this.

525
02:06:47,430 --> 02:07:12,300
Ah, something telling me I wasn't supposed to do that. Red pipe. Red pipe. Well, not yet. Well,

526
02:07:12,300 --> 02:07:21,130
yes, fine. What is this showing me? Well, it actually is a full-on, this is how you beat it.

527
02:07:21,850 --> 02:07:46,619
That's really cool, actually. That's a nice touch. What? I gotta get to look like the video.

528
02:07:46,619 --> 02:08:06,329
Ugh. I have this problem in Mario where I have to hold down the face button. Why? Every... for

529
02:08:06,329 --> 02:08:22,310
everything. No matter what. I have to. Even if I'm not trying to run. Okay. So what does this want

530
02:08:22,310 --> 02:08:34,380
me to do here? Do I need to bring that up with me? Or damage boost and then I just need you to wait

531
02:08:34,380 --> 02:08:52,220
like an extra five seconds is what I had to do. Okay. Let's see. That's gonna be something,

532
02:08:52,220 --> 02:09:15,779
isn't it? What? All right. Oh, okay. We're fine. No. There's no red pipe here, guys.

533
02:09:17,130 --> 02:09:31,670
I don't see a red pipe. No red pipe. Uh, I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it.

534
02:09:33,619 --> 02:09:53,340
Come on. Give me another one. Oh, damn it. Okay. How far does that go?

535
02:09:53,340 --> 02:10:08,630
Shit. Then go to the checkpoint. What do I do with this thing? No red pipe either. Do I have to fall

536
02:10:08,630 --> 02:10:15,220
down with it or throw it over there? I didn't see what was on the other side of this. Throw it over

537
02:10:15,220 --> 02:10:43,510
there and then there's a ground. I don't have to go fast. For some reason, I think I have to fall

538
02:10:43,510 --> 02:11:02,140
down and then like jump on it later. No, no, no, no, no. Just go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

539
02:11:02,140 --> 02:11:20,489
All right. And now, um, jump. I think I have to throw this, jump on top of it with the spring,

540
02:11:20,489 --> 02:11:30,579
throw the spring, jump on the spring. I think. I can't reset the level ever again.

541
02:11:32,340 --> 02:12:05,930
No. Oh, come on. Really? Did I seriously just do that to myself? I'm stuck. The doors.

542
02:12:07,380 --> 02:12:12,899
Do you understand I'm trying to get to the doors on the left and I have ruined it for myself?

543
02:12:13,619 --> 02:12:35,109
I feel like if I fall at the right angle, I might be able to... There it is. All right. I just...

544
02:12:35,109 --> 02:12:40,840
Don't worry, but I'm probably gonna die because that's... I have to grab this,

545
02:12:41,800 --> 02:12:47,319
throw this, stand on that. Let me just see how fast it goes. Okay. Grab that. That goes pretty damn

546
02:12:47,319 --> 02:13:10,100
fast. Oh, it's the other way around. Oh, give me that. Give me this. Give that to me. Give me this.

547
02:13:10,739 --> 02:13:19,300
I need that. Am I overthinking it? I have to jump, throw, and then... I think I am overthinking it.

548
02:13:32,920 --> 02:13:39,369
What? I... Holding? Why? I wish there was a way I could... Is there a button that you can hold the

549
02:13:39,369 --> 02:14:01,960
run without the pick up button? I wish I could press it. Let's try this again. So, throw the pow

550
02:14:01,960 --> 02:14:27,079
and throw... Okay, throw the pow, throw the... Blow up! I did it. I'm gonna say I did it. I have to do

551
02:14:27,079 --> 02:14:47,829
like a little trail. How far up do I need to go? No, no. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

552
02:14:48,470 --> 02:14:58,470
Did I go too high? I went too high. Shit. I can't get that back. Where's my reset button?

553
02:14:58,470 --> 02:15:25,529
There's no reset door here? Shit. I gotta get it up here. No, I don't... Where's my reset door?

554
02:15:44,699 --> 02:15:56,840
Usually I can get that pretty well. Although I screwed this one up last time. Oops.

555
02:15:59,319 --> 02:16:22,180
Fuck. No, I usually can get this. Damn it. Holding? Why in a Mario game? Don't ever do it.

556
02:16:22,739 --> 02:16:49,100
Still don't get this part though. Don't throw the pow, just use it.

557
02:16:50,860 --> 02:16:53,940
I don't think that killed anything. Did that kill anything down here?

558
02:16:57,139 --> 02:16:59,459
No, it didn't. I needed to see. No, it doesn't kill anything over there.

559
02:17:10,979 --> 02:17:18,299
No! Just throw it. Just... I got it over there. I don't give a fuck. It's over there now, isn't it?

560
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:42,280
I'm vetoing this one. Only a few more tries and I'm vetoing this one. I didn't want to even do

561
02:17:42,280 --> 02:17:52,629
that again by holding Y. Oh my god. Why would they make the run button the same as the grab button?

562
02:17:52,629 --> 02:17:59,459
Everybody runs in Mario. Everybody holds that button down. Make it like L fucking 2 or something.

563
02:17:59,459 --> 02:18:24,809
Why does it have to be Y? No! Fucking Y. Nothing's gonna bring me down today.

564
02:18:47,139 --> 02:18:57,030
Hold X. You can't hold X and Y at the same time. You have to like turn your hand inside out. I'm

565
02:18:57,030 --> 02:19:17,819
getting like tilted down. Jesus. Get me over here. Throw the... Throw the spring first and then grab

566
02:19:17,819 --> 02:19:47,850
the pow. I'm gonna just go. Oh my god. I hate it. All right. Three more attempts and I'm stamping

567
02:19:47,850 --> 02:20:38,950
the veto on this one. No. No. No. No. I don't think so. I'm just gonna take the... I'm just gonna

568
02:20:38,950 --> 02:20:58,260
damage boost over it. I'm not gonna do that. I'm not gonna be able to do that shit. Nope. No. God

569
02:20:58,260 --> 02:21:13,110
damn it. This shit is fucking so difficult. He's like throw, jump, grab. This wasn't in Mario 2.

570
02:21:13,909 --> 02:21:31,579
I don't have the momentum to go all the way... I'm just gonna damage boost it I think.

571
02:21:32,139 --> 02:21:37,239
Because I don't have... I don't... I'm not getting the momentum to go forward to jump on the spring.

572
02:21:38,040 --> 02:22:06,229
How far... What is... So that just flies forward and then jump across. How far does this go? Grab, jump.

573
02:22:06,950 --> 02:22:14,469
Get on the roof. I don't think I need to... I don't... If I get on the roof I lose the spring.

574
02:22:17,030 --> 02:22:25,620
Uh that was weird. Try it again. Don't jump. I'm not jump throwing. I'm just walking.

575
02:22:29,260 --> 02:22:38,139
I don't care. All right. Now this is important. I need to get this spring on that spike.

576
02:22:39,100 --> 02:22:45,420
How do I do that without screwing this up? This is gonna be so bad.

577
02:22:46,700 --> 02:22:51,750
I got it. I got it. Okay. I did it. I did it. Just don't touch the spikes.

578
02:22:52,309 --> 02:22:58,059
And then I jump off this one. I can do this. I can do it. I'm gonna do it.

579
02:22:58,700 --> 02:23:20,790
And that's fucking scary. Oh yes. Yes. Yes. There's a checkpoint. Thank God. Yes. Excellent.

580
02:23:20,790 --> 02:23:32,059
I'm so happy there's a checkpoint here. What a gracious dev. I know. Thank you gracious dev.

581
02:23:33,899 --> 02:23:37,340
So you gotta go. It took me a long time to die.

582
02:23:44,760 --> 02:23:48,200
Damn. All right. I gotta hit that and fall and then go back and hit again.

583
02:24:09,219 --> 02:24:22,170
Springs. He's throwing. Spring. Easy. I can't pick this up. So wait. Do I just bounce off this to get

584
02:24:22,170 --> 02:24:25,690
faster momentum and then jump over? Hold on. How far does it go?

585
02:24:26,329 --> 02:24:57,780
Okay. And did I screw it up? I think I screwed it up. I'm trying to time it so I can.

586
02:24:59,639 --> 02:25:11,260
I think it's over. So you gotta go right away. Oh boy. And you gotta hit the ones up here.

587
02:25:11,979 --> 02:25:14,780
The two. Oh dear. All right. You gotta do it all in one go.

588
02:25:26,420 --> 02:25:29,479
Did I have to keep going? I don't think I had to keep going.

589
02:25:30,569 --> 02:25:40,379
Uh and then up. Oh I don't know. I don't know. I think I have to run really fast

590
02:25:40,379 --> 02:25:56,040
and jump and throw this and hit this. I think. Oops-a-daisy. Yeah that's what I have to do.

591
02:25:56,040 --> 02:26:15,290
I probably could have jumped on top of that but I don't understand. Oh guess what I did. I pressed Y.

592
02:26:15,290 --> 02:26:32,340
The right trigger should be grabbed. Can I remap that?

593
02:26:34,260 --> 02:26:39,059
You know you're starting to get annoyed in Mario when you want to remap the controls

594
02:26:39,059 --> 02:26:42,260
in Mario. Like that's when you know that you're like actually getting angry.

595
02:26:42,260 --> 02:26:48,149
How do I remap the fucking controls in Mario 2? Really? Shit.

596
02:27:20,180 --> 02:27:25,530
Maybe I should just try to keep going left. That would just make me jump up this way.

597
02:27:25,770 --> 02:27:32,629
That wouldn't do much for me would it? I'm kind of confused but wouldn't I just jump up?

598
02:27:35,559 --> 02:27:44,780
I have to actually start the hold X and Y at the same time but then you have to let go of Y.

599
02:27:44,780 --> 02:28:13,780
That's so awkward. Just throw the spring. Holy shit. Okay well I have one. Is that what I'm

600
02:28:13,780 --> 02:28:40,860
supposed to do? Why did it not do that? What happened? I get the secret level. 17 minutes.

601
02:28:41,500 --> 02:28:47,700
Who can beat that in a minute? He missed the true ending. I don't get true endings. Don't you know

602
02:28:47,700 --> 02:28:53,030
that? 1.5% completion. I'm good. Get the true ending. I don't get true endings.

603
02:28:53,750 --> 02:29:11,799
That was fucking hard. That was challenging. Very cool though. Yeah it's time for a pee break.

604
02:29:12,920 --> 02:29:19,319
I'll be right back. Go do what you need to do. See you guys in like two minutes. Be right back.

605
02:29:19,319 --> 02:31:59,940
I'm back. So where are we going now? You will consider mine. It even has a fish.

606
02:32:00,899 --> 02:32:11,340
I absolutely will consider that. Fail fish. Oh okay I get it. Now I see what you mean.

607
02:32:17,899 --> 02:32:31,290
I think did you type it in wrong? I think did you mean that? Why can I not? Let's see.

608
02:32:32,010 --> 02:32:49,579
This is wrong. Why can I not type? I think the code is wrong. Why is Z? What's going on?

609
02:32:56,360 --> 02:33:00,760
Why is Z, I, and O not available? Because they look like 2s, 1s, and 0s?

610
02:33:03,670 --> 02:33:12,059
All right. Oh so that person just it was a made-up level. All right.

611
02:33:12,860 --> 02:33:39,829
I see fun cool level please. I'll do this one. Not too hard for you. What do you mean for me?

612
02:33:40,549 --> 02:33:54,979
It's called thwomp. Thank you for the level. Standard puzzle solving. For me or for you?

613
02:33:55,540 --> 02:34:06,309
I thought I had to hit that with my head but nope. Let's go.

614
02:34:18,090 --> 02:34:26,180
Oh it's in 3D world. This sucks automatically. That's not true. Um I gotta jump up,

615
02:34:26,180 --> 02:34:49,350
dodge that, jump around, get the P, and then get the V. What's going on? Oh.

616
02:34:49,510 --> 02:35:07,239
Oh. Can I get it back? Secret. Secret way. I always beat it secret way.

617
02:35:09,319 --> 02:35:29,879
I actually kind of want to go that way. All right. Let's go.

618
02:35:40,620 --> 02:35:46,180
I just made myself fucking like two times bigger when you play

619
02:35:46,180 --> 02:35:54,760
Super Mario dog shit 3D gets stuck to the wall become like fly paper when you play Super Mario

620
02:35:54,760 --> 02:36:22,680
3D world. What? What happened to my? Did you see the bottom of the screen? I don't think.

621
02:36:26,520 --> 02:36:29,479
Super fucking 3D fly paper. That's what this should be called.

622
02:36:51,209 --> 02:37:02,229
3D world man. Oh and there's an end. They make it so you can't get up here.

623
02:37:02,229 --> 02:37:07,559
All right. I'm gonna be all right. I thought you said you liked 3D world.

624
02:37:08,760 --> 02:37:14,760
Oh.

625
02:37:40,649 --> 02:37:55,450
I don't know. Up. I get it. Blasphemy.

626
02:37:58,010 --> 02:38:26,520
I feel like I have a backpack full of cement on when I played Mario 3D world.

627
02:38:46,920 --> 02:38:57,260
I'm getting three. I don't like 3D world. I remember when I opened the Wii,

628
02:38:57,260 --> 02:39:01,420
whatever it was, I got it. I played Mario 3D world like 30 minutes and I was like I don't like this

629
02:39:01,420 --> 02:39:29,579
game. You understand? You understand what happened? You understand? What the fuck is going

630
02:39:29,579 --> 02:39:43,190
on? New Super Mario Brothers 3D whatever is it's equal parts like floaty and heavy at the same time.

631
02:40:05,049 --> 02:40:34,760
So you know when you eat a huge fucking meal right at the last bite you feel like shit and you're

632
02:40:34,760 --> 02:40:43,239
wicked way down like I shouldn't have eaten that last bite. I feel like I have like a stomach full

633
02:40:43,239 --> 02:40:53,159
of fucking a bunch of like meat and cheese and shit. I don't understand what's happening now.

634
02:40:53,879 --> 02:41:40,500
Yeah, Super Mario New Wii 3D full pizza. Can you do it again? Please? Can I get this to happen again?

635
02:41:56,899 --> 02:42:01,780
Extra large fucking steak and cheese. Somebody gave me subs. JermaSucks gave me five subs.

636
02:42:03,540 --> 02:42:34,579
Now just go down and then what the fuck do I do here? Oh okay YouTube.

637
02:42:36,260 --> 02:42:44,809
All right I'm doing this a few more times. Only a few more times.

638
02:42:47,079 --> 02:43:00,540
And no more Mario 3D world levels before I fucking puke. All right, just kill me. Do you remember

639
02:43:00,540 --> 02:43:06,620
the last time we played this? What was the game that made me like very upset? It wasn't Mario

640
02:43:06,620 --> 02:43:31,340
World. It wasn't Mario 2. It wasn't like Mario 64. It was these ones. I don't even have it if it's

641
02:43:31,340 --> 02:43:37,579
that. Oh my god. That fucking wall jump is like equal parts impossible to do and equal parts like

642
02:43:37,579 --> 02:44:18,440
too easy to get stuck. How is it possible? What the fuck happened? All right this is it. Last

643
02:44:18,440 --> 02:44:37,500
no this is the last try. Keep my mouth shut. I know this game is like a 9.8 on IGN. I'm talking

644
02:44:37,500 --> 02:44:41,659
about Mario 3D World. I know. I know but every game that's a Mario game has to be a nine or

645
02:44:41,659 --> 02:45:32,229
you go out of business. You understand? Oh this isn't 3D World. No I know but you know the new

646
02:45:32,229 --> 02:46:04,420
Super Mario Wii Brothers. Whatever the hell it's called. Luigi plays Wii. Whatever the hell it is.

647
02:46:04,420 --> 02:46:17,739
Can't beat this land. Well you know it's uh this is Joel's level. Oh great. 0.1% this 58,000 attempts

648
02:46:17,739 --> 02:46:37,270
here. Do you think I'm gonna be able to do this? I'm not gonna be able to do this. Oh god. I don't

649
02:46:37,270 --> 02:46:44,760
even want to know. You have to get all the key things. Oh I feel so I feel right at home though.

650
02:46:44,760 --> 02:47:06,120
This is Mario 3. Okay. Watch out for the Goomba. Should I go underneath? How am I gonna get under

651
02:47:06,120 --> 02:47:22,809
this? Oh this just gets worse by the second. What do I do? Underneath. Oh god. Wait. Hold on. Slow down.

652
02:47:23,450 --> 02:47:36,649
Slow down. Ah. No. No. I needed that. What? How do I get that and then go?

653
02:47:39,319 --> 02:47:45,239
God. You have to go around? How do you pick that up? Go up on top and okay.

654
02:47:46,200 --> 02:48:05,020
Oh this is gonna be hell. Okay I'm going. For a second I thought I could do that. I don't know why.

655
02:48:05,819 --> 02:48:09,829
That might be a little secret though. You might actually feel good today. You know what I'm saying?

656
02:48:09,829 --> 02:48:29,209
Okay it took Joel 20 hours to beat this and he's the one that made it. It actually literally took

657
02:48:29,930 --> 02:48:38,100
20. I think I can do that. I think it's possible to go right when. That's the little skip. That's

658
02:48:38,100 --> 02:48:50,569
the dev skip. Okay let's try this again. Oh man. It was 20 hours across two different streams.

659
02:48:51,930 --> 02:49:11,139
I'm gonna try this. Hold on. Where's the one that comes out?

660
02:49:11,219 --> 02:49:27,879
What doesn't come out? Why would I go this way? I thought.

661
02:49:37,819 --> 02:49:48,250
Oh man. I'm not gonna be able to do this. See? That's what I mean. Then go down with it.

662
02:49:56,600 --> 02:50:06,549
I can't even get this first jump correct. All right. I need to. Is it the top of the coin on

663
02:50:06,549 --> 02:50:32,819
the arrow? Somebody do it. Kill it. Kill it. Somebody kill it. Kill them. It's not the last

664
02:50:32,819 --> 02:50:53,829
coin. I have to get this jump down and I don't know what point it is. What else I can do? I'm

665
02:50:53,829 --> 02:51:03,799
just gonna go now. No no no no no no no. Then. Oh man. That sucks. I gotta get the star and then

666
02:51:03,799 --> 02:51:31,780
come back and go all the way around. Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait. What?

667
02:51:31,780 --> 02:51:55,299
Can I? Can I do that? Can I do this? Can I actually do this? If it. Oh! Joel 19 hours

668
02:51:55,299 --> 02:52:01,579
when knowing how to do it. Uh yeah. I mean I'm willing to just have a little bit of fun with it

669
02:52:01,579 --> 02:52:18,260
but I'm never gonna beat this. I need to at least get this first jump correct. What if I just say

670
02:52:18,260 --> 02:52:40,200
fuck it? No. I'm not gonna go that way. Man this is gonna be hell. I have an idea. Though the name

671
02:52:40,200 --> 02:53:06,219
of this level is called. I get it. I can't get it. Does that not work? Oh shit! What? Okay. No no no

672
02:53:06,219 --> 02:53:23,100
no no no. Wait wait wait. Get me out of here. Um what do I do? I don't know. I don't know. I don't

673
02:53:23,100 --> 02:53:43,020
know. You have to run. Just run and jump? I at least have to get to the end of this. You gotta

674
02:53:43,020 --> 02:54:10,540
kid me. Why? I'm dead. All right just run. I'm just gonna run and then jump. Do I keep holding this?

675
02:54:13,129 --> 02:54:59,989
I don't know. Oh my. Nooooo. That's fucking insane. You gotta get that little pixel.

676
02:55:00,950 --> 02:55:29,100
What? How do you even program that to work? How does that work? Yeah how did he do this

677
02:55:29,100 --> 02:55:37,100
for like 20 straight hours? At hour number four? I don't think I would. I think I'd be like guys

678
02:55:37,100 --> 02:55:59,020
I have to leave. I'll see you like tomorrow. And tomorrow I'm not doing this. How did I get it the

679
02:55:59,020 --> 02:56:08,860
first few times easily? Don't go faster than the shell. That would be a mistake.

680
02:56:24,020 --> 02:56:31,879
Yeah I don't know about this one. Yeah I don't know. I don't know about this one.

681
02:56:38,469 --> 02:57:02,010
Why does my microphone sound like it's on fire? It's clearly not. Come on please. I don't go that

682
02:57:02,090 --> 02:57:19,420
fast. All right now I'm gonna do this. Get this and then fall here. All right going.

683
02:57:23,899 --> 02:57:29,129
It was a laugh. Somebody laughed. I don't know. I don't know why this is supposed to be funny.

684
02:57:29,129 --> 02:57:49,209
Why is this funny? I obviously can't jump over there. Do I just lose? I think I might just lose.

685
02:57:53,420 --> 02:58:14,709
All right so that door doesn't do anything. You know how I get with this kind of shit though.

686
02:58:14,709 --> 02:58:21,510
Like I'm gonna be here. I'm not gonna be here for much longer. I can't. We got like all the

687
02:58:21,510 --> 02:58:35,780
viewer levels to do. I'm not gonna do this the whole time. I'll be here for a year. All right

688
02:58:35,780 --> 02:58:44,500
now. So how? I shouldn't. Should I not get this? If I get the. Okay so I have to damage boost.

689
02:58:48,329 --> 02:59:28,420
What? No. So I have to wait till the mushroom gets down and then get hurt and then run. This

690
02:59:28,420 --> 03:00:12,969
shit over there. Do I have to jump over there or something? I thought that was it. Go. Oh my god I

691
03:00:12,969 --> 03:00:19,959
have to go. I just panicked. I didn't want to hit the thing. I was gonna hit it. All right so let me

692
03:00:19,959 --> 03:00:35,500
hold on a minute. If I hit the mushroom and then the mushroom touches me while I'm small. Like

693
03:00:35,500 --> 03:01:11,299
walk, get hurt, run, damage boost. You can't make that jump. You can't make those jumps.

694
03:01:12,260 --> 03:01:33,209
But where do I stop? It didn't even. That was. It didn't kill the thing up there. I was gonna die.

695
03:01:33,770 --> 03:01:59,750
Look at this again. The shell comes down. Does it come all the way over here? Does another one come

696
03:01:59,750 --> 03:02:10,889
up? Where does that one go? Okay it bounces over here and then where does it go from here?

697
03:02:12,579 --> 03:02:24,059
Nowhere. It hits a switch. Okay what is it hitting? I gotta just kind of run.

698
03:02:24,540 --> 03:03:03,209
Okay hold on. I can go in there when it's red? I have no idea. And then just try to stop.

699
03:03:08,860 --> 03:03:22,569
Fuck. Is there a safe zone? I don't know where the safe part is. But thankfully I can do this

700
03:03:22,569 --> 03:03:37,430
pretty easily now. Oh that was bullshit. I brought the shell with me the first time and I don't have

701
03:03:37,430 --> 03:03:54,170
to get on top of the shell. How would I do that? This level is named after Central British time.

702
03:03:54,170 --> 03:04:02,760
Yeah I know. But there's got to be like a solution. All right I'm gonna a few more tries.

703
03:04:03,639 --> 03:04:22,600
Do I actually need the shell? All right I'm skipping it. I'm gonna skip it after like two more.

704
03:04:22,600 --> 03:04:28,069
If I can't get, if I can't figure this out, there's probably like another 75 hours to this.

705
03:04:33,860 --> 03:04:48,040
Oh god. Do I have to get all those too? The solution is to punch yourself in the groin for

706
03:04:48,040 --> 03:05:03,129
a couple dozen hours. That's true. Although no that's not the solution. I at least want to

707
03:05:03,129 --> 03:05:36,040
get through here one more time. Really? Shit. Okay um I can't make that jump. Hold on let me test

708
03:05:37,879 --> 03:06:01,540
No there's no way. That's gonna kill me. No fuck. No come on. No no. How did I make it worse?

709
03:06:02,420 --> 03:06:37,450
What is that? How do I get over there? All right this is it. I can't, I can't, I it's crazy level

710
03:06:37,450 --> 03:06:45,770
and it's fun. It's fucking crazy. But I gotta, I gotta move on. You're telling me that I need to jump

711
03:06:45,770 --> 03:06:55,540
over these and that's the way to do it. That's what you're trying to tell me? You're telling

712
03:06:56,020 --> 03:07:16,260
you're telling me that I have to jump over each one of these. Every single one. Oh my god. You

713
03:07:16,260 --> 03:07:51,319
have to keep the momentum going to just keep going. If you stop you're dead. No. No way. No way. I'm

714
03:07:51,319 --> 03:07:56,040
not doing it. I'm done. I'm done. No fucking way. We're out. That's it. That's it for this one. No

715
03:07:56,040 --> 03:08:00,440
more of this one. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. No. No. No. You're gonna do the whole thing

716
03:08:00,440 --> 03:08:12,360
all the way down? There's no way. It's not fucking happen. You gotta be kidding me. Because then

717
03:08:12,360 --> 03:08:23,020
you're gonna turn and do it down the bottom. Holy shit. How did you ever beat this? Even if you

718
03:08:23,020 --> 03:08:36,739
memorize this, there's like a tiny bit of human error. I want to just see the failure. Watch the

719
03:08:36,819 --> 03:09:01,020
clip. Are you serious? How would you even do this? There's no way. You've got to be fucking

720
03:09:01,020 --> 03:09:07,420
kidding me. You have to follow the mushroom all the way. The whole way.

721
03:09:16,020 --> 03:10:02,780
Look at this shit. Are you ready for this? You have to fucking pick this up. Thanks for watching

722
03:10:02,780 --> 03:10:23,899
everybody. I can't even get past the first three blocks. It looks like he's walking it too. Is he

723
03:10:23,899 --> 03:10:52,459
walking it? He wasn't running. He's walking. Come on. Get walking. I can do this. Here we go.

724
03:10:53,100 --> 03:11:07,100
Wait. What's in front of me? You gotta hit and jump around it. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. I'm not

725
03:11:07,100 --> 03:11:20,379
doing it. It's too hard. And that's not even like... There's no way. Only 84 people have completed

726
03:11:20,379 --> 03:11:31,020
that. Out of 58,000 attempts. Now that's an incredibly difficult level. Thank you Joel for

727
03:11:31,020 --> 03:11:51,559
making it fun. What's next? This one. Thank you to Germaput Sunchips in F tier. That's a pretty

728
03:11:51,559 --> 03:12:41,559
great name. And then RSF. Let's give it a try. Stop acting. Minus two dying Jill. Okay. Okay.

729
03:12:41,559 --> 03:13:16,760
All right. Let's try it again. Oh, I can do... I can do the... Can I even make that? I don't think

730
03:13:16,760 --> 03:13:48,389
I can make that. I'm not sure I can. Whoa. Whoa. What the fuck? Okay. So that was interesting.

731
03:13:49,430 --> 03:14:00,809
You gotta get on that lower level. Toad's fat ass just hit the hit. That was... Sorry. Toad's diaper

732
03:14:00,809 --> 03:14:09,850
hitbox. Why am I Toad? I don't want to be Toad anymore. How do I change character? How do I

733
03:14:09,850 --> 03:14:33,930
change character? Slide down. Right there. On off. And then. And then. And then. And then. And then.

734
03:14:33,930 --> 03:14:38,409
And then. Ah! I gotta... Is there... Do I get another one? Do I get another turtle?

735
03:14:39,450 --> 03:15:33,590
Shit. I'm holding it down. I swear to god. No! No! No! Give me that turtle. No. God damn it. Come on.

736
03:15:33,590 --> 03:15:43,719
Really? I got stuck. Come here. Oh shit. No. No, no, no. Turn... Stop. Stop it. Please.

737
03:15:44,680 --> 03:15:53,590
No. I gotta pick it up. Oh my god. I am gonna fuck it. My soul is leaving my body.

738
03:15:53,590 --> 03:16:13,129
I'm alright. I'm not mad. I'm not mad. I'm not mad. I'm fine. Nothing's gonna make me mad today.

739
03:16:13,129 --> 03:16:27,209
Tell you. You know why. September 21st. You gotta plan on September 21st to cancel it. Wait, do I...

740
03:16:27,209 --> 03:17:33,690
I gotta leave that on. No! I wanted to jump on his head. Fuck. Now what? How fast is he? What?

741
03:17:37,940 --> 03:17:54,809
What? I'm just gonna hold right. There's nothing else I can do there. Do I have to actually kill

742
03:17:54,809 --> 03:18:43,209
that thing? No! Now he's too close. Fuck. I like this one. Come on. I wonder if there's more.

743
03:18:45,049 --> 03:19:07,909
This is the one. He ain't even close. They're all cheering him on. Alright. From here I gotta jump

744
03:19:07,989 --> 03:19:23,579
to... Anything else? I'm scared. Can I make this jump? What? No! I... It... The slide. I thought the

745
03:19:23,579 --> 03:19:37,260
slide was gonna... It slides. Oh. Um. You know. The slide. I don't know why. You can slide up.

746
03:19:38,299 --> 03:19:57,750
Can you? I don't know. I don't remember that. Can you? I don't know. God. Why did you do that?

747
03:20:19,739 --> 03:20:30,540
He's dead. Wait. Is he... Is he gonna go the other way? Alright. I'm gonna kill him and then we don't

748
03:20:30,540 --> 03:21:02,200
have to worry about it. I swear to God. I'm just trying. I'm trying. I'm really trying.

749
03:21:03,159 --> 03:21:12,889
Damn it. This game, man. This game. It's just... It's too much sometimes. I'm trying. Now I'm just

750
03:21:12,889 --> 03:21:45,239
singly jumping. Not even twist jumping. I'm just normal jumping. I think he's gonna catch me. I

751
03:21:45,239 --> 03:22:07,819
don't think I did it fast enough. Alright. That was really close. And then... Is that it? There's a

752
03:22:07,819 --> 03:22:11,260
troll coming up. I know it. There's gonna be some... A block or a brick or a hammer or a

753
03:22:12,540 --> 03:22:16,139
block or something that's gonna stop me. I don't know what it is but it's gonna happen.

754
03:22:17,659 --> 03:22:20,659
I don't know what it is. Something bad's gonna happen right here. I don't know what it is.

755
03:22:21,940 --> 03:22:48,579
Uh. How do I... I need to have the shell hit that but I can't get it. Alright. So then

756
03:22:49,540 --> 03:23:06,120
go in here? I think. What hap... What? Um. What do I do? Now what do I do? Which way? Which way do I go?

757
03:23:07,559 --> 03:23:31,000
To the right? Oh no! There's a guy coming. There's a guy coming. Wait. No. No. It was coming. I knew

758
03:23:31,000 --> 03:23:37,079
it was gonna happen. I knew it was gonna happen. I knew there was gonna be something there that

759
03:23:37,079 --> 03:23:42,040
caused a huge problem. Why would there be music there if there wasn't something bad or scary or

760
03:23:42,040 --> 03:24:01,399
watch out! Look out! Imagine being this high strung for a kids game. Uh. No. This is this is

761
03:24:01,399 --> 03:24:14,680
not a kids game. Kids don't do this. Can't be. This is this is like a... No. Nuh-uh. This is like a

762
03:24:14,680 --> 03:24:43,940
Newgrounds parody game. You know what I'm saying? This is not like Super Mario. Is it enough?

763
03:24:44,579 --> 03:24:57,780
Mm-hmm. No! Oh! Just barely enough. It's just barely enough. Okay hold on. Don't screw it up.

764
03:24:59,379 --> 03:25:07,500
Cross. Alright. Now it's just you land, you kill both the things, then you land and run

765
03:25:07,500 --> 03:25:27,739
instantly. At least that's what I think I have to do. Let's do it. Get them both crushed. Okay.

766
03:25:28,950 --> 03:25:56,440
Fall and then run. Two. Go! That was fun. That was a good one. No that was that was cool. Really

767
03:25:56,440 --> 03:26:11,129
good. Nice job. Everyone's done a nice job. Just because you have a Super Mario 3D world level

768
03:26:11,129 --> 03:26:25,340
doesn't mean your level is bad. It's just like you know. Here's a pallet cleanser. I'll do the

769
03:26:25,340 --> 03:26:44,780
pallet cleanser for sure. Tea. I'm into the pallet cleanser level. Snow-capped mountain climbing.

770
03:26:45,340 --> 03:26:49,739
Enjoy the scenic sights of snow-covered mountains and even ghost flunking. I can't

771
03:26:49,739 --> 03:27:19,459
wait to play this one. Mountain climbing. This is a pallet cleanser. This is what I'm talking about.

772
03:27:19,459 --> 03:27:53,030
This is great. Should I go down? I'm gonna go down. Save it. Alright. Baby level. No. Not every single

773
03:27:53,030 --> 03:28:03,479
level in Mario Maker has to be like burn my eyes with hot stones. Everything doesn't have to be

774
03:28:03,479 --> 03:28:36,229
like as hard as possible. I don't know why but for some reason apparently all levels

775
03:28:36,229 --> 03:28:44,149
in Mario Maker have to be like blast death metal and slam monster energy drinks and scream

776
03:28:44,790 --> 03:28:50,340
while you run forward and then jump like a thousand times. Sometimes you just want to do

777
03:28:50,340 --> 03:29:01,399
some mountain climbing and that was fun. I did it. I don't have to go take the baseball bat.

778
03:29:01,399 --> 03:29:05,319
Lean forward with the bat. Put my head on it. Spin around in a circle 20 times and then pick

779
03:29:05,319 --> 03:29:20,870
up the controller. That was fun. What a nice pallet cleanser. We got a medium difficulty right here

780
03:29:20,870 --> 03:29:53,860
and you got it. Nice job. Okay this is called trampolines in the sky. Challenging platforming

781
03:29:53,860 --> 03:30:18,149
course. Crouch while releasing springs to drop. 13 minutes. Holy fuck. Only one person has cleared

782
03:30:18,149 --> 03:31:39,510
this. Do I take this? Okay. I think I hit a switch somewhere. Don't throw it. No. Crouch

783
03:31:39,510 --> 03:32:11,000
to drop. Try this again. There's the switch. That was close. So now that switch is done.

784
03:32:11,239 --> 03:32:26,309
Then up here. Now the claw machine thing.

785
03:32:28,790 --> 03:32:47,110
I want that 50. It's right there. It's giving me. It's not that even that greedy. It's just

786
03:32:47,110 --> 03:32:53,270
clear. Okay I'm fine. All right so now we was I not supposed something happened over there

787
03:32:53,270 --> 03:33:04,299
on the right? All right I don't want to die here. What happens now? Okay.

788
03:33:08,059 --> 03:33:14,860
Uh spring comes out of here. I wonder. Should I just go up from here?

789
03:33:18,299 --> 03:33:28,379
Can't. Um up through there? No don't kick it.

790
03:33:43,139 --> 03:33:44,420
I'm gonna bring this back over here.

791
03:33:44,420 --> 03:33:51,299
Um kind of. Should I go up?

792
03:33:54,100 --> 03:34:05,739
Come on. I think I have to do this. Drop it. Why does my face hurt?

793
03:34:06,969 --> 03:34:20,040
I don't know man. Oh shit. That's not what I wanted. There's a checkpoint right there too.

794
03:34:27,450 --> 03:34:45,270
Oh my god. What have I done? How long is it going to take me to do this until I do the

795
03:34:45,270 --> 03:35:02,520
mechanic that it says in the description? Yeah I gotta throw shit around. Give me.

796
03:35:05,479 --> 03:35:11,500
Where's the other one? Where are my trampolines? Did I? Where's this one?

797
03:35:12,379 --> 03:35:57,690
Give it to me. What? Oops. Give it here. I'm not gonna get it.

798
03:36:01,209 --> 03:36:04,340
No no no no. Just fall. I'm trying to think if I could do something else there.

799
03:36:06,260 --> 03:36:11,319
I gotta get up there so I have to jump from the spring over here.

800
03:36:12,280 --> 03:36:16,629
Right. I'm just gonna try it. See what happens.

801
03:36:18,870 --> 03:36:29,379
I didn't want to get grabbed but fine. All right now if I drop it right now.

802
03:36:31,540 --> 03:36:56,040
Oh that's it. Okay I gotta get caught. Okay then get caught again and bring this around on here.

803
03:36:56,920 --> 03:37:01,479
Do I wanna do this? I guess.

804
03:37:04,120 --> 03:37:07,420
Up there.

805
03:37:11,350 --> 03:37:26,840
No. I didn't have to go all the way back down. Why am I going so fast?

806
03:37:49,739 --> 03:37:55,819
Okay that was. I gotta skip this one. It's cool but I like just my fucking finger just slipped.

807
03:38:07,319 --> 03:38:10,760
I like I was in the air and then I let go but then I hit it again somehow.

808
03:38:10,760 --> 03:38:44,760
I'll do this one. Frigid cavern run. Oh shit. It's another one of these.

809
03:38:45,799 --> 03:38:48,840
My first level there are two 1-ups so you're under a time limit. Shit.

810
03:38:49,639 --> 03:39:12,860
Oh let's give it a try. 29 seconds. Oh fuck. All right you gotta.

811
03:39:21,299 --> 03:39:37,000
All right. I think you go too fast if you bounce off that one.

812
03:39:37,639 --> 03:39:59,780
Oh I should have seen that coming from a mile away. Inferno. Thank you Inferno for the five community

813
03:39:59,780 --> 03:40:15,049
subs. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. I gotta dump the whole thing. Thanks for the

814
03:40:15,049 --> 03:40:43,700
five subs. Thank you. Do I need the key? Oh I need the coin. Uh oh. Ice is killing me.

815
03:40:47,909 --> 03:40:49,750
You're taking a shot every time I die.

816
03:40:55,379 --> 03:41:03,290
How on earth are you supposed to get that in an ice level that has 30 seconds on the clock?

817
03:41:31,209 --> 03:42:01,100
Shit I didn't get it. Oh my god. Shit.

818
03:42:01,180 --> 03:42:30,020
I'm going so. I'm going to slow down a little because I don't know what's even.

819
03:42:56,620 --> 03:43:00,059
Damn man. How are you supposed to do that so fast?

820
03:43:07,780 --> 03:43:22,309
Hope I don't need it. Let me just get up there and see. What the hell is even up here?

821
03:43:24,500 --> 03:43:29,299
Do I have to jump over the whole thing with a small jump? I don't even know if I can do that.

822
03:43:30,260 --> 03:43:52,760
I think I have to jump, hit the ceiling, and then land and then fall.

823
03:43:52,760 --> 03:43:57,059
I think. I actually need to get up there and try again. I just don't understand what I want to do there.

824
03:44:11,530 --> 03:44:32,620
Yes. No. I don't get it. All right. A handful more attention I gotta move on.

825
03:44:34,819 --> 03:44:37,340
Did this bounce back and kill me?

826
03:44:37,739 --> 03:44:55,540
It starts to blend together, man. It just mixes up into a bunch of colors in your brain.

827
03:44:55,540 --> 03:45:03,379
Humans weren't supposed to be doing this. You know what I'm saying? People were farming 500 years ago.

828
03:45:03,379 --> 03:45:24,620
Your brain's not supposed to do this. People were riding in horse and buggy and oh good evening,

829
03:45:24,620 --> 03:45:31,180
madame. Yes, sir. I'll take two sheep. My eyes are wide open and we're hearing the same sounds and

830
03:45:31,180 --> 03:45:35,260
my eyes are wide open and we're hearing the same sounds and the same images over and over again,

831
03:45:35,260 --> 03:45:57,930
screaming at us. We weren't supposed to be doing this. The ice is killing me, too.

832
03:45:57,930 --> 03:46:09,059
The ice. It's the ice. The fucking ice is killing me. I need to figure out this jump

833
03:46:09,059 --> 03:46:14,860
because the ice keeps slowing me down. See what I'm saying? I get them. How the fuck?

834
03:46:15,979 --> 03:46:22,979
I figured it out. I just did it. I did it. What do I do? I have 10 seconds. Go. Just get up there.

835
03:46:23,620 --> 03:46:34,420
Did I just beat it? Oh my god, I beat it. I did it. I didn't mean to do that. I did it. Okay,

836
03:46:34,420 --> 03:46:56,010
I can do this. And I'm gonna keep in track of how many levels I've completed by accident

837
03:46:56,010 --> 03:47:01,260
that are one percent levels, two percent levels. It's been at least two or three.

838
03:47:01,979 --> 03:47:10,340
Let me try this one for real. No, I can't do this again. These speed runners just get in my brain.

839
03:47:10,340 --> 03:47:28,059
No!

840
03:47:45,420 --> 03:47:55,500
All right, last try. That's it. I'm out. That was that one. That doesn't count.

841
03:47:56,540 --> 03:48:03,129
One more try where I get to the top. My birthday candle just went out.

842
03:48:03,129 --> 03:48:13,659
Don't make me laugh right now. Stop it. What? That doesn't count. That doesn't count. That doesn't

843
03:48:13,659 --> 03:48:28,360
count. That doesn't count. Just wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me just get up there with the key.

844
03:48:38,540 --> 03:48:42,059
Come on. Oh, I just need to get... I can't do four minutes. Come on.

845
03:48:43,020 --> 03:49:05,819
This is it. I promise. Come on. Go! Go! I have the key. Please just get over here. All right,

846
03:49:05,819 --> 03:49:18,090
I got the key. Got the key. Got the key. Which door? That's all this did? What? That's it.

847
03:49:23,879 --> 03:49:31,780
Oh, god damn. Whatever. I don't care. That was a good one. That was fun. All right, give me

848
03:49:31,780 --> 03:49:56,420
enough. Give me the next one. All right, this person said pretty please. Okay. I always go into

849
03:49:56,420 --> 03:50:04,260
these streams with just like a really open mind and I like I don't want to like just start like

850
03:50:04,260 --> 03:50:15,000
talking shit about games and I always goes back to like Mario 3D Wii. I always start it. I'm fine,

851
03:50:15,000 --> 03:50:27,209
but like they oh it never fails. All right, this is called Sandwich? Let arrows, left arrows are

852
03:50:27,209 --> 03:50:37,989
tap R, up or hold R, jump on thwomps. Left arrows are tap R, up or hold R. Left is R, up is hold R.

853
03:50:40,329 --> 03:50:55,110
Left is right, up is right. This is gonna take a little bit of messing around. Left is right,

854
03:50:55,110 --> 03:51:11,770
up is right. How did I get underneath? I don't even know how I got underneath them. Can you jump on

855
03:51:11,770 --> 03:51:23,000
top of these in this one? No. It's the R button? That's not. Why didn't he move?

856
03:51:24,200 --> 03:51:43,030
Yeah, you can spin jump. Okay. Hold R, up is... Is this like an activator? He went real fast.

857
03:51:44,950 --> 03:52:10,309
I thought he was gonna move. He's going too fast. Okay. I still don't... I don't... What was the whole

858
03:52:10,309 --> 03:52:57,930
point of that description? What the fuck? I know it's a reset door, but I'm trying to figure out

859
03:52:57,930 --> 03:53:13,500
how to like hit this. I have no fucking idea what's happening. All I know is that I died.

860
03:53:20,819 --> 03:53:32,280
Do I have to activate that one? I'm looking at the end. No, I can't make that whole thing.

861
03:53:34,280 --> 03:54:04,379
Jesus. This is pretty awkward, but it's fun. Did something wrong there.

862
03:54:04,459 --> 03:54:24,920
All right. What is the difference here? So maybe I should forget about the guy down here?

863
03:54:24,920 --> 03:54:38,020
Just activate the one over to the right? Who gives a shit? You gotta be kidding me.

864
03:54:46,579 --> 03:55:14,299
I'm doing it. I can get it. Okay, then I'm gonna fall now. Why? I thought I hit it in the head.

865
03:55:14,299 --> 03:55:52,920
Come on. I'm upset about that. I'm actually upset about that. He's actually upset. No, that one was

866
03:55:52,920 --> 03:56:14,680
fun. I did the secret. Classic Mario. Let's try that one. I don't think there's been... There's been

867
03:56:14,680 --> 03:56:21,260
not very many classic regular Nintendo Mario levels, have there? I think there was one or two.

868
03:56:29,049 --> 03:56:48,069
Bowser's Sky Gauntlet. A five-part gauntlet courtesy of the classic King Koopa. All right.

869
03:56:50,250 --> 03:57:22,979
Gauntlet? A boss rush? All right, somebody said the last level and it's fucking with my head right

870
03:57:22,979 --> 03:57:27,700
now. I don't know why. Somebody said that he's the only person to die to a green Koopa. Somebody

871
03:57:27,700 --> 03:57:31,860
said that like five minutes ago and it's in my head right now because I saw a green Koopa.

872
03:57:37,610 --> 03:58:00,579
That hitbox is weird. Holy shit. I just tried to jump on that like it was a platform. You idiot.

873
03:58:02,100 --> 03:58:33,940
He's dead. I got him. I did it. Bad ending. A minute and three seconds. Not bad. All right,

874
03:58:33,940 --> 03:58:38,899
this one says very important level. Let's find out. That was good. That was fun.

875
03:58:41,100 --> 03:58:44,139
Mario 3D World. Your favorite. I'm not even gonna... I'm not gonna open that one.

876
03:58:57,610 --> 03:59:14,409
A useful lesson. A simple level with a very important message. This one's kind of freaking

877
03:59:14,409 --> 03:59:31,079
me out a little. I'm... I'm kind of afraid of this one. Okay. What's your important message that is

878
03:59:31,719 --> 03:59:59,350
rank? And yeah, that's true. That's... don't... yeah. That's... no, that's a great... that's a good

879
03:59:59,350 --> 04:00:19,690
message. That's a really good message actually. That's a really good one. Don't do that. That's

880
04:00:19,690 --> 04:00:32,260
simple level with a very important message. 95%. So would you just like get there and like not...

881
04:00:32,899 --> 04:00:38,120
you must have like saw... maybe you're just like, ah, I don't want to play this one. It's a word one.

882
04:00:38,200 --> 04:01:12,709
All right, here's this one. 2WN95GG. Big boom booms castle. Collect Mario's mount

883
04:01:12,709 --> 04:01:31,780
and armor to defeat the lord of castle boom. Get the mount and the armor. Sure. But I'm not...

884
04:01:31,780 --> 04:01:40,760
okay, how do I... I change character by here, right? Settings. Where do you actually do this?

885
04:01:40,760 --> 04:01:56,299
I don't want to be Toad anymore. Um, let's... let's be Super Mario. Okay. Sorry, Toad. You're out.

886
04:01:59,190 --> 04:02:12,120
That's a normie thing to do. No, the normie thing would be I'm gonna be like somebody...

887
04:02:12,120 --> 04:02:42,229
I'm gonna be like Toad! Why am I just running over this? And go! Fast. Wow, that's a big drop. Okay.

888
04:02:42,229 --> 04:02:54,889
Mario is the gibbous of Mario games. That doesn't even make any sense at all.

889
04:02:56,309 --> 04:03:00,790
That's too fast. It's too fast. I gotta wait till it's like almost all the way done.

890
04:03:01,750 --> 04:03:17,430
It's not the gibbous. Mario is the the actual engine that the game runs on. Now let's go here.

891
04:03:18,149 --> 04:03:33,479
Back up there right now. Oh, let's check this out first.

892
04:03:34,360 --> 04:03:56,969
Let's go through this. Is this the armor? Does this count as like the shield of the armor?

893
04:03:57,850 --> 04:04:12,340
How do I get that coin? I can't believe somebody just said spin.

894
04:04:15,670 --> 04:04:21,030
And I listened to them. Why did I listen to you? There was no reason for you to listen to you.

895
04:04:21,909 --> 04:04:26,549
Everybody gets so... why did you not listen to chat? Oh, now I'm all fucking tilted.

896
04:04:26,629 --> 04:04:31,590
No, no, I'm all fucking tilted. How did... what, what... never mind.

897
04:04:33,670 --> 04:04:39,829
There's too many coming out here. All right, this is ridiculous. I'm fucked. Holy shit, they're stuck.

898
04:04:46,299 --> 04:05:04,809
No, blow it up. Hurry. I'm gonna wait till it explodes. I can't, I can't do this kind of shit.

899
04:05:05,450 --> 04:05:18,309
Why? I'm telling you. I can't... where's the armor? In here? Armor... no, it's not. I think my controls

900
04:05:18,309 --> 04:05:51,639
ran out of battery. I just pressed jump and it took three seconds to happen. Down blue. There's a key here.

901
04:05:52,840 --> 04:06:06,440
Um, where's that fire? Should I get that? I think I'm gonna get that. Take a risk. No, don't take any risks.

902
04:06:08,440 --> 04:06:29,459
Put this on. There's the armor. I got it. Oh, I can break these right with the helmet.

903
04:06:29,459 --> 04:06:57,299
Oh, two keys. Um, uh, excuse me. Excuse me. That's not fair. That's not fair. Unfair. Spawn.

904
04:06:58,100 --> 04:07:34,010
Why? Can I do this now? What if I don't have my mount or my helmet? Still... can I still beat it?

905
04:07:34,010 --> 04:07:56,729
P? I think I just got stuck. No, I didn't. Okay. I can't move. I thought that was fire. I was about

906
04:07:56,729 --> 04:08:19,610
to fucking scream. Anything over here? There's this guy. I have the P. Uh, get away from me.

907
04:08:19,610 --> 04:08:29,340
Get away from me. Um, what am I? What should I do? What should I do with the P? I don't know

908
04:08:29,340 --> 04:09:00,170
what to do with the P. Can I fly with the P? You piece of shit. Um, I got it. Fall. Please fall, right?

909
04:09:00,170 --> 04:09:17,559
No. Okay, I got all three keys. I got the key and now I... what should I do with the block? Why is

910
04:09:17,559 --> 04:10:05,829
I stuck to the ceiling? Um, wow. Oh my god. I just fucking panicked. Like the ultimate panic. Did I

911
04:10:05,829 --> 04:10:47,319
get it? Okay, I need to stop. Stop, please. That was fun. That was a fun one. That was nice. That was

912
04:10:47,319 --> 04:10:53,579
good. That was interesting. Except for like that, you know, spawning... bomb spawning. I mean,

913
04:10:53,579 --> 04:10:56,139
I don't know. I kind of got killed. I didn't feel like I deserved that.

914
04:10:56,940 --> 04:11:24,860
You are great at Mario and you are very tall. Hey, gonna have to give it to that one. I like it when

915
04:11:24,860 --> 04:11:36,899
he gets mad. Escape the swamps while avoiding the hungry piranha plants. Too bad you're not

916
04:11:36,899 --> 04:11:54,010
great at Mario. It's alright. That's fine. We already got over our leg meltdown. Oh no, we

917
04:11:54,010 --> 04:12:17,540
didn't. Never mind. Avoid the piranha plants. It's like a pretty wholesome level, right?

918
04:12:46,520 --> 04:12:52,729
Wait, what's down here? Secret? No, I screwed it up.

919
04:12:52,729 --> 04:13:25,379
It's to make a Mario. Take a while. That was fun. That was a good one. Thank you for that

920
04:13:25,379 --> 04:13:43,590
level. It was good. Play this one for the joke. For the jokes, okay. All right. After this,

921
04:13:43,590 --> 04:13:47,030
can somebody link me one of those that you stand still and it plays a song?

922
04:13:53,430 --> 04:13:58,790
Can somebody link me? It's got to be the Game of Thrones theme. I want to see that. It has to

923
04:13:58,790 --> 04:14:26,729
exist. Morality based. What is this? Yoshi's Choice? Question mark. What am I doing here?

924
04:14:43,579 --> 04:15:16,040
Well, that's interesting. Five seconds. Hold on. I can do that in five seconds.

925
04:15:16,040 --> 04:15:58,090
I can do that shit in five seconds. How long was that? How on earth do you do that quicker?

926
04:15:58,090 --> 04:16:28,040
No, I'm done. I'm just gonna do the level. So you gotta fall down and then I'll try it.

927
04:16:28,760 --> 04:17:30,809
I need Yoshi again. That's longer than I thought. One more try. Oops-a-daisy. Oops-a-daisy. All right,

928
04:17:30,809 --> 04:17:47,159
that was fun. Next, coming up. I'll try the tuna and pretzel connection that you've been preaching

929
04:17:47,159 --> 04:18:21,370
to us if you play my level. Yeah. No, you're just spelling up pretending. I get it. Okay,

930
04:18:21,370 --> 04:18:36,299
can we get a real one or what? Isn't this one real? Hey, regardless, you better try that

931
04:18:36,299 --> 04:18:54,579
combination. I remember your name. I will remember. This is for me. Actually, for Jermo.

932
04:18:54,579 --> 04:19:27,860
This should be challenging enough. I regret putting this one in. You can't get more than one

933
04:19:27,860 --> 04:20:22,299
second. How? One bounce on the head? Right, that's gotta be it. Are you doing this right now at the

934
04:20:22,299 --> 04:20:42,200
same time? One... I don't... That's... You can't go faster than that. It's not possible. Okay, okay,

935
04:20:46,520 --> 04:21:01,239
okay. I'm done. I don't care. It was... No, it's 1.3370. Nobody can get faster than that. All right,

936
04:21:01,239 --> 04:21:33,239
give me another one. This is a relaxing trip to Chill Peak. Don't mind if I do. Chill Peak

937
04:21:33,239 --> 04:21:53,239
Mountain. Have a relaxing vacation at beautiful Chill Peak Mountain. Mario 3. I already like it.

938
04:22:00,180 --> 04:22:31,190
This song is freaking me out because it doesn't belong here. Pretty chill. This is from... What

939
04:22:31,190 --> 04:22:45,399
is this? Rainbow Road? No, no, no. The one where you're... The slide? That's the slide. Right, right,

940
04:22:45,399 --> 04:22:59,350
right. Or what I think would be better use of this music is a non-stop gif of a hamster running in

941
04:22:59,350 --> 04:23:26,729
a wheel. Video idea for some of you that have hamsters? No, I gotta fly. There's gotta be

942
04:23:26,729 --> 04:23:51,659
something over there. Come on, you gotta have something over there. That was... That was a chill,

943
04:23:51,659 --> 04:24:18,809
fun level. Thank you, that level. All right, just because you wrote, try it out. My very funny

944
04:24:18,809 --> 04:24:47,159
level and you put ha ha ha ha ha ha in all caps. I had a great a different description but forgot.

945
04:24:47,159 --> 04:25:03,370
Version 3. This is a 3% level. Reach the goal after activating all 999

946
04:25:03,930 --> 04:25:27,510
POW blocks. Did this take like six years to make this? The world record is an hour.

947
04:25:28,149 --> 04:26:05,770
How the fuck do I get out of here? What is happening? What am I doing wrong? Oh, all right, then...

948
04:26:06,489 --> 04:26:09,690
But I can't get... I can't do anything about that.

949
04:26:36,340 --> 04:26:39,139
But what? What the fuck? How do I get this thing?

950
04:26:41,219 --> 04:27:01,670
Okay, low battery. Oh no, what do you mean low battery? I charge these all night.

951
04:27:03,670 --> 04:27:13,260
Low battery, what? I'm gonna have to bring the dock. No, anyway, I can't. Hold on.

952
04:27:13,420 --> 04:27:41,940
Hold on. This thing is a lot of the way. Go here. I don't know what that...

953
04:28:06,340 --> 04:28:09,940
You're probably wondering why I did... I'm just trying to run... I got like a hundred keys.

954
04:28:12,340 --> 04:28:14,819
I ran back and forth once and I got a bunch of keys, so I'm...

955
04:28:26,489 --> 04:28:30,170
Oh my god. Okay, why is it giving... What's with all the keys?

956
04:28:31,129 --> 04:28:47,049
Pretend it's not. It's called experimentation. I don't get it. I'm gonna come back. That just gives me...

957
04:28:48,649 --> 04:29:02,090
I don't even... I can't even talk. Can you hear this? Huh? Uh, thanks for the five community subs.

958
04:29:02,729 --> 04:29:11,049
That was for he to meet. Thank you, subs. Five. Appreciate it. Thanks for the five community subs.

959
04:29:11,770 --> 04:29:18,649
So, I don't understand this.

960
04:29:21,209 --> 04:29:28,170
What's the time frame on that? You just have to wait like eight, five seconds? Um, all right.

961
04:29:49,500 --> 04:30:07,739
I don't know. No! Kill me quick! Skip this. I... Hold on. Just let me... Just give me a minute.

962
04:30:08,860 --> 04:30:12,200
I'm not ready to give up yet. Let me skip to the end of that thing.

963
04:30:13,079 --> 04:30:19,620
Okay. So, it's like...

964
04:30:24,100 --> 04:30:43,100
What's happening here? Should I go...

965
04:30:51,670 --> 04:30:58,809
Was there a spike? Did I just sit on a spike? What? Was there a spike in...

966
04:31:06,040 --> 04:31:12,440
Yeah, I don't know about this one. I mean, it's funny, but I don't know if I'm gonna sit here all night.

967
04:31:13,319 --> 04:31:33,530
Okay, deal. Just in here. And then, uh, should I try...

968
04:31:36,170 --> 04:31:45,239
There goes a hamster! Somebody get a gif of a hamster running away.

969
04:31:45,799 --> 04:32:02,629
Please. I need to see it. I gotta see if my viral video is gonna take off or not.

970
04:32:03,270 --> 04:32:22,540
You guys tell me. Do you really care about this level? Hold on. It's paused. Don't worry.

971
04:32:32,180 --> 04:32:46,520
That's funny. That's funny. Yeah, this is funny. The world record is actually an hour long. How do

972
04:32:46,520 --> 04:33:11,450
you do this for an hour? No, it's gotta be faster than that. Faster! I need a faster run. I don't...

973
04:33:11,450 --> 04:33:22,919
I just want to see what this looks like. I need to know. You know, the hamster has to be running,

974
04:33:22,919 --> 04:33:35,159
like, really fast. No, there's none of these that are that fast. They're slow. Does anybody

975
04:33:35,159 --> 04:34:13,450
have a fast one? Is this fast? Speed up the video on YouTube. Oh, here we go. No, this is...

976
04:34:13,450 --> 04:34:26,250
Yeah, this is perfect. This is absolutely perfect. Good. All right, let's do it. This is a good break.

977
04:34:26,250 --> 04:34:49,580
I'm taking a break. Let's go. And now, damn... 20 kids at the aquarium. Okay, here we go.

978
04:34:49,580 --> 04:35:15,939
Here we go! That was really cute. That was a very cute video. I would share that on Facebook.

979
04:35:16,580 --> 04:35:55,959
That's because I'm looking over here and people are, like, fucking furious with that.

980
04:35:57,959 --> 04:36:03,560
People, like, talking so much shit about that hamster. Oh, I couldn't handle it. I'm sorry.

981
04:36:04,599 --> 04:36:11,639
I think people are fucking losing their mind about how much they hate the hamster. I don't know.

982
04:36:13,400 --> 04:36:25,979
My fucking grandmother was like this. It sucked. Oh my god. Every time I hear this, it sucks.

983
04:36:27,900 --> 04:36:36,259
Oh, this is dumb. That's dumb. Okay, I'm gonna tell you that's dumb. I don't want to do this one

984
04:36:36,259 --> 04:36:51,500
anymore. That's dumb. That's just dumb. I don't want to do that. I got it. I turned it down.

985
04:37:01,099 --> 04:37:09,779
Oh, you guys are fucking hilarious. You're giving up on a minute-long level. This is not a minute-long

986
04:37:09,779 --> 04:37:35,880
level. Okay, do it, pow, and then go right in the door. Go! What? Where's the trick? There's a trick

987
04:37:35,880 --> 04:37:46,869
somewhere. Where's the trick? There was a trick that I was in. I got hit by the trick already.

988
04:37:48,139 --> 04:38:01,509
This is the trick. Yes, it is. You're right. I got tricked. All right, this is the last attempt

989
04:38:01,509 --> 04:38:25,720
and then I'm out. We'll do another one. I'm stuck right now. You know what I mean? I'm fucking stuck.

990
04:38:26,040 --> 04:38:47,319
Okay, so I go up into here and then what? Does it not go in there? Did I do it? Okay, apparently

991
04:38:47,319 --> 04:38:51,240
I just hold on. Okay, I held on to the wall. Now what? I'm gonna get crushed. There's somebody in

992
04:38:51,240 --> 04:39:24,490
there. How do I? No, that's a joke. I can't get that. How am I supposed to get that? I'm going

993
04:39:24,490 --> 04:39:37,540
to take the damage. Won't I take the damage from the... Do I have to grab that from the very bottom

994
04:39:37,540 --> 04:39:45,560
pixel? All right, this is my actual final attempt. I promise. I swear this is the final attempt.

995
04:39:46,200 --> 04:40:14,950
I want to see what happens there. Yeah, I'm curious. All right, let's do this again.

996
04:40:16,840 --> 04:40:27,349
Hold on to the side. There we go. All right, so how do I get this? Just by jumping up and...

997
04:40:28,310 --> 04:40:52,549
No, I can't go this way. Oh, come on. No, that's... Why? No, that's not fair. All right, I...

998
04:40:54,549 --> 04:41:11,099
I know that's the last one, but that wasn't my fault. I know that was not my fault. That was not

999
04:41:11,099 --> 04:41:17,979
even my last attempt. That was the game... You know what I'm saying? That was not a real attempt.

1000
04:41:18,939 --> 04:41:25,720
If I died by... Oh, I got hit by a spike! Okay, that's me. I didn't lose to that. The game lost

1001
04:41:25,720 --> 04:41:33,029
for me. Like, if I fell down right there, that's an attempt. If I get hit in the head by a wrench

1002
04:41:33,029 --> 04:41:55,590
or something, whatever, that's my fault. Okay, here we go. I know there's a little battery.

1003
04:41:59,099 --> 04:42:07,029
All right, break the blocks and then... Now what? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1004
04:42:07,909 --> 04:42:27,369
What happens now? Huh? No, you saw... Break the... Why didn't I shrink? Break the one on the left,

1005
04:42:27,369 --> 04:42:33,740
somebody said, and then I freaked out. That one doesn't count. That was... Somebody in chat died

1006
04:42:33,740 --> 04:42:37,639
there. Not me. Somebody said, break the one on the left, break the one on the left. No, no, that

1007
04:42:37,639 --> 04:42:40,759
wasn't... That was somebody in chat that did that. I didn't do that. That was not something I was

1008
04:42:40,759 --> 04:42:56,220
gonna do. No, that was not me doing that. Hey, hit the one on the left! And I was like, okay,

1009
04:42:56,220 --> 04:43:13,540
this is your turn, so you do it. Nobody told you to follow his advice. No, but still...

1010
04:43:15,450 --> 04:43:23,750
Okay, this is it. This is op... This is on my own. Whatever I do here, this is my doing.

1011
04:43:24,389 --> 04:44:22,340
No one else is going to do this for me. This is my doing. All right, all right. All right, okay.

1012
04:44:23,819 --> 04:44:32,810
Joel just came in with a raid. What's up, Joel? I tried your level and I didn't do very well. It

1013
04:44:32,810 --> 04:44:40,569
was very, very hard. It was super ridiculously hard, but it was very fun, very well thought out.

1014
04:44:40,569 --> 04:44:48,279
I heard it took you 20 hours. I watched the part where you went all the way down and around and

1015
04:44:48,279 --> 04:44:55,500
died at the end, and I vicariously lived through like 12 hours of your life and decided I wasn't

1016
04:44:55,500 --> 04:45:06,020
gonna do it. But welcome, everybody. We're doing just random viewer levels. He said it was a pile

1017
04:45:06,020 --> 04:45:16,549
of shit. I did not... I did not say that. Don't listen to that. All right, how about this one?

1018
04:45:16,549 --> 04:45:21,819
But thank you so much for the raid. If you stick around, we're gonna do this for a little bit

1019
04:45:21,819 --> 04:45:26,970
while longer. Probably another couple hours or something. All right, prove that you're a gamer

1020
04:45:26,970 --> 04:45:35,669
and beat this level. I'll try. Is this one of those levels that laughs at you and makes you

1021
04:45:35,669 --> 04:46:02,860
stuck somewhere? 20 seconds? Megalovania. All right, let's go. Speedrun? It's a... oh, it's a song.

1022
04:46:03,419 --> 04:46:13,500
How has only one percent seen a song get done? Oh, by the way, if you've never seen... if you've

1023
04:46:13,500 --> 04:46:37,909
never seen Undertale, don't look. Spall the coins. Only 19 more seconds. That's right.

1024
04:46:51,060 --> 04:46:56,419
I was running. What? Stop, there are spoilers everywhere.

1025
04:46:56,900 --> 04:47:20,549
What? Now what? Oh god, I have to go up and around. Oh. Oh! What do you do here? You idiot.

1026
04:47:20,549 --> 04:47:44,459
You idiot. You idiot. I at least want to hear the first part of the song.

1027
04:47:46,459 --> 04:48:30,040
Whoa! Spin jump. Spin jump. That was close. Oh! It hit me in the fucking face! What was the point

1028
04:48:30,040 --> 04:48:54,200
of you... should I hold on to that? Ah! Ah! Ah! It actually came down and hit me.

1029
04:48:54,200 --> 04:48:59,139
And hit me. I don't... why am I bringing it? I don't even need to bring that stupid thing.

1030
04:48:59,139 --> 04:49:47,610
Oh my god, I'm an idiot. I did it again. Does... what happened?

1031
04:49:56,229 --> 04:50:27,849
What happened? I... maybe... I gotta see that end. Shoot it? I have to spin jump down there? I only

1032
04:50:27,849 --> 04:51:05,700
have one second remaining. Oh sh... um, I need to know what... I hit the POW when they were on the

1033
04:51:05,779 --> 04:51:10,580
screen. They were clearly on that screen. They were on that screen. You saw them. What happened

1034
04:51:10,580 --> 04:51:33,959
there? I can still do it. All right, so I hit the POW but it didn't kill them down there.

1035
04:51:33,959 --> 04:52:05,619
Doesn't it really blow up everything? Not fast enough. It's the time. Oh man. That was bullshit.

1036
04:52:05,619 --> 04:52:21,580
I got like stuck in the goddamn wall. I'll get it. How did I not touch those? I'm clearly touching

1037
04:52:22,459 --> 04:52:44,919
them. I don't... I'm upset about that. We're back in time again. Dead. I just hit myself in the face.

1038
04:52:46,759 --> 04:52:50,520
Don't jump. I have to like keep moving and I have to hold up and I have to...

1039
04:53:10,389 --> 04:53:15,270
It's right here. I crouched for a tenth of a second. It was like...

1040
04:53:16,229 --> 04:54:49,209
That's all right. Jesus! It's right there. I can smell it. Touch it! Oh, that sucked.

1041
04:54:49,209 --> 04:55:09,020
That sucked. That was that sucked. That's unfortunate. Come on. Move, move, move, move.

1042
04:55:12,090 --> 04:55:30,630
Touch it! I did it! That one was fun. I think I actually had to ground pound. That was pretty

1043
04:55:30,630 --> 04:55:47,669
good. There you go. Prove you're a true gamer. I'm... sometimes I'm a gamer. Not all the time,

1044
04:55:47,669 --> 04:56:25,900
though. All right. This one says, I swear to the Lord. Let's try this one. Plinko shell drop.

1045
04:56:25,900 --> 04:56:33,880
Drop the shell in a slot and see if you can get the jackpot. I feel like I'm going to really like

1046
04:56:33,880 --> 04:56:50,819
this one. I am. Get 60 coins. Reach the goal of grabbing 60 coins. Easy enough, I guess.

1047
04:56:52,340 --> 04:56:56,259
Does it matter which one of these I pick? I know I got low battery.

1048
04:56:56,419 --> 04:57:41,689
I know where it goes. Is this like the dev door? No. All right. I have to follow it.

1049
04:57:42,650 --> 04:57:56,020
I just have to see what I get. I guess I could float down with it, but then I have to come back

1050
04:57:56,020 --> 04:58:44,569
up. Give me 50 coins right now. Right at the bottom. 50. 50! 50! 50! No! What's the point

1051
04:58:44,569 --> 04:59:21,319
of having Yoshi? What does Yoshi do here? It's cute. Yeah, but... No! Oh, shit. I'm gonna do it

1052
04:59:21,319 --> 04:59:41,689
again. We're at the bottom. Wait, you want me to swim all the way down there? All right,

1053
04:59:41,689 --> 05:00:01,590
we're gonna go second here. Right, the door means elevator up. Yes. Yeah. Where did that just go?

1054
05:00:02,549 --> 05:00:07,689
That would make sense, wouldn't it? There would be a door here.

1055
05:00:08,330 --> 05:00:18,180
You're right. Come on, give me the big 50. Why do they all keep going over here?

1056
05:00:39,990 --> 05:00:44,869
Come on, I want to have him go down. No! I want to... Come on, go get him.

1057
05:00:46,549 --> 05:00:52,939
It was gonna work, too. It was gonna work! And now he has the thing in his mouth!

1058
05:00:53,819 --> 05:00:59,159
Despawn. I promised I wasn't gonna scream anymore, and I just did.

1059
05:01:00,119 --> 05:01:30,020
I was trying to drop him down, so maybe he would just float all the way down and grab the 50.

1060
05:01:30,020 --> 05:02:05,270
You're not actually doing this, are you? I thought I was gonna get stuck again. It is.

1061
05:02:06,470 --> 05:02:12,459
No, it's not. Thank God. Don't do it again. Don't do it again. It's gonna do it again.

1062
05:02:15,220 --> 05:02:22,220
Thank God. Come on. I'm almost done. Give me the 50. It's what Yoshi would have wanted.

1063
05:02:29,619 --> 05:03:08,200
50! 50! Yeah! Get the hell out of here. I win. That was a fun one. I liked it. It was fun.

1064
05:03:22,779 --> 05:03:43,189
We got a Life is Pain. I'll give it a try. LPM. What else we got? 1VG. Life is Pain.

1065
05:03:45,290 --> 05:03:50,330
Why did I pick the one that said Life is Pain? The level can only be beaten by sliding backwards.

1066
05:03:50,970 --> 05:04:50,939
Okay. The frozen backwards only cave. I thought I had to slide backward. Can you jump? No.

1067
05:05:02,180 --> 05:05:14,419
Ignore the level name and just go. All right. Fine. You can't walk. You have to go backwards.

1068
05:05:14,419 --> 05:05:37,639
That's what the thing says. I'm losing momentum! I know. I'm sorry. Every time I get really intense,

1069
05:05:37,639 --> 05:06:12,659
it sounds like somebody punching me in the stomach. I'm sorry. Walk to the left. Somebody

1070
05:06:12,659 --> 05:06:53,380
said keep jumping to do momentum. Right here. What if I turn a little... No. Come on. I'm not

1071
05:06:53,380 --> 05:07:11,060
good at it. I'm not. This is Super Mario Wii 3D. This is never gonna happen. What the fuck? Okay.

1072
05:07:11,060 --> 05:08:08,409
Hold on. No. Almost there. No. Do it again. I keep hitting down. It's just in my brain

1073
05:08:08,409 --> 05:08:12,840
because it's slide. You have to slide. Doesn't that mean you have to hold down?

1074
05:08:12,840 --> 05:08:45,400
Like slide backwards to win. Oops. All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. I'll do it. I got it.

1075
05:08:45,400 --> 05:09:11,049
I lost it already, I think. I just had to do it earlier. It's all right. It's not that bad.

1076
05:09:24,310 --> 05:09:35,400
I fucked it up again. You gotta go longer with the slide. Stay in thing with this.

1077
05:09:35,400 --> 05:09:57,770
You gotta do longer. I still get it. You don't have to jump into sliding when I stop moving.

1078
05:09:57,770 --> 05:10:33,049
It's all right. No. It's not all right. See? I keep having problems with that first slide.

1079
05:10:33,770 --> 05:10:54,459
It's okay. The game didn't fuck up yet. Cheater. No. It actually was bad because it stopped me.

1080
05:10:55,500 --> 05:11:09,750
Okay. Here it is. Here it is. Here it is. Here it is. This is the part. All right. All right.

1081
05:11:09,750 --> 05:11:24,099
No. You motherfucker. It's right there. That was it too. Shit.

1082
05:11:35,400 --> 05:11:58,659
This is so addicting, but it's gonna kill me. Stupid fucking low battery.

1083
05:11:59,619 --> 05:12:03,779
I don't care if it's low battery. Stop telling me. You told me like 10 times.

1084
05:12:03,779 --> 05:12:08,360
I don't need you to distract me. I know the battery's low. I know. You don't have to tell

1085
05:12:08,360 --> 05:12:52,310
me every five minutes. I promise. I know. I'm telling you. Humanity is gonna get to a point

1086
05:12:53,369 --> 05:12:57,610
where like this is not gonna be enough. We're gonna start slapping each other in the faces with

1087
05:12:57,610 --> 05:13:12,090
fucking frying pans in like 20 years. This is not gonna be enough. This is gonna be frying pan

1088
05:13:12,090 --> 05:13:16,490
streams where like I hit you in the face with a frying pan and you hit me in the face with a

1089
05:13:16,490 --> 05:13:34,119
fucking frying pan. It's not enough anymore. What happened there? What? I just stopped like

1090
05:13:34,119 --> 05:13:55,419
dead in my tracks. That was weird. It's so fucking much for my body and brain to do this a million

1091
05:13:55,419 --> 05:14:03,909
times. And it's with my least favorite Pokemon too. It's with my least favorite Mario game.

1092
05:14:03,909 --> 05:14:36,090
What is it doing that? Why is it freezing me? That's the second time that's happened. Am I

1093
05:14:36,090 --> 05:14:57,959
doing something wrong here? I don't understand it. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. I got it. I did it. Oh

1094
05:14:57,959 --> 05:15:06,919
my god. I did it. Yes. Wait. Hold on. What do I do now? Can I not touch that? I can touch that,

1095
05:15:06,919 --> 05:15:49,830
right? What does that mean? You fuck. That was unfortunate. I just heard the laugh. It means I

1096
05:15:49,830 --> 05:16:42,299
can't do it. I heard like the fucking cat noise. That was genuine. It eats away at my fucking soul.

1097
05:16:50,090 --> 05:16:58,200
Oh, I'm going too fast. No, I gotta slow down. So I'm so glad I did the beginning again though.

1098
05:17:00,229 --> 05:17:17,240
So I'm not sliding bad. Then I'm not sliding forwards. I mean backwards, I mean. That's not

1099
05:17:17,240 --> 05:17:38,939
gonna be like deduct points or something, right? How do I open this door? How do I open the door?

1100
05:17:38,939 --> 05:18:13,319
Just walk. Just walk. Just walk. Just walk. I did it. Wait. Does this matter? This doesn't fucking

1101
05:18:13,319 --> 05:18:41,659
matter. 39 seconds. That was crazy. He has a calming level. Oh, that's funny. Jubated. I like it.

1102
05:18:41,659 --> 05:18:50,380
I made this fun. Let's try it. What was the completion on this? 2%. That was fun.

1103
05:18:59,479 --> 05:19:14,779
PNM. 8. TG. I made this one. Four cast calls with lots of fish bones. Left, right, left. When does

1104
05:19:14,779 --> 05:19:58,419
it end? Short and sweet. Fish bone barrage. I know how to do this. I can't do this in like

1105
05:19:59,540 --> 05:20:11,860
hot dog mode. You can't play Mario Maker in hot dog mode. All right, hold on. No, I got it. I got

1106
05:20:11,860 --> 05:20:18,569
it. I got it. Don't worry. I'm fine. I'm gonna charge these up. Hold on a sec. Just wait.

1107
05:20:18,569 --> 05:24:01,419
All right. Take a pee break. I'll be right back. I got controllers here. I'm good. All right. I'm

1108
05:24:01,419 --> 05:24:13,560
good to go. It's starting to communicate. Yeah, I'm good. I'm ready. Okay. Was I on a level?

1109
05:24:14,200 --> 05:24:24,340
I think I was, right? Fish bone barrage. Well, there goes a CD. I don't know what the fuck it was.

1110
05:24:30,860 --> 05:24:57,020
All right. I think that's a joke. I can't get them. Maybe I can. Will those kill me if they touch me?

1111
05:24:57,020 --> 05:25:05,459
Probably, right? Where's like the indicator of where they land? It's like a telegraph.

1112
05:25:08,250 --> 05:25:17,139
Dear, what are they gonna fall? It just takes up the screen. Left, right, left, right, left, right.

1113
05:25:17,139 --> 05:25:30,630
Okay. Left, right. Oh, I get it. All right. That's a neat little, uh, that was right. So, they're

1114
05:25:30,630 --> 05:25:39,669
gonna go left side now. Two, three, left. They're gonna be on the right side. And that's the thing

1115
05:25:39,669 --> 05:26:00,459
that kills me. I'm looking up. So, when you're here, that's right. Because that's, now that's left.

1116
05:26:02,180 --> 05:26:19,689
The beeps are left and the errors are right. Hang on. Oh, shit. Not good. It's gonna be left,

1117
05:26:19,689 --> 05:26:34,310
isn't it? That was, that was a different beep than the other ones were, right? I thought that was

1118
05:26:34,310 --> 05:26:47,509
going right. Because that really looks like this one. This one goes boop. See? I, I'm not sure the

1119
05:26:47,509 --> 05:27:11,930
sounds matter. I think it just goes left, right, left, right. Hurry, hurry up. But, oh, shit. No,

1120
05:27:11,930 --> 05:27:36,060
please. I tried to aim it. I tried to block it. No, it's gonna be on the left. Shit. Oh, boy.

1121
05:27:38,740 --> 05:27:49,799
I thought, I don't know if we, at first, I had a little bit more time, I guess. I thought I had

1122
05:27:49,799 --> 05:28:06,099
way less time. What the fuck? Oh, fuck. I gotta go this way. Because that's not gonna be over.

1123
05:28:07,580 --> 05:28:24,459
No. Come on. I gotta stand underneath it. Which way is it gonna go? Oh, man. You have to jump

1124
05:28:24,459 --> 05:28:37,909
right underneath when I go. Damn it. All right. I thought, it spawned me, like, right in the thing.

1125
05:28:39,990 --> 05:28:46,810
I feel like it takes me two or three times to do that every single time.

1126
05:28:48,330 --> 05:29:18,150
I'm holding B. It just doesn't go up. Why? Shit. Okay. Block it. Block it. Please.

1127
05:29:18,709 --> 05:29:32,840
All right. I gotta make the jump up right before they land. Now what? All the way to the right?

1128
05:29:34,119 --> 05:30:12,040
Anything else to block? Oh, God. Just go in. Just go in. Get out of here. There it is. That's not

1129
05:30:12,040 --> 05:30:22,860
gonna, was that gonna kill me? I thought I was gonna die. That was a really good one. Cheers to

1130
05:30:22,860 --> 05:30:34,889
that. How do I, what do I, I can't like it. Oops. All right. We'll try this one. This one

1131
05:30:34,889 --> 05:31:00,020
requires no gamer skills. And I like the sound of that. MBG4C6TWG. What does that say? Wait,

1132
05:31:00,020 --> 05:31:29,849
did I get that wrong? B. Wait, what? I read MBG4C6TWG. MBG4C6TWG. That didn't work. MBG4C6TWG.

1133
05:31:30,169 --> 05:31:54,470
Yeah. Weird. All right. We'll do this one. 5TV. It's MGB not, it's MGB not MGB.

1134
05:31:55,430 --> 05:32:01,580
You're confusing the absolute fuck out of me right now. All right. Mario in the haunted treasure.

1135
05:32:05,799 --> 05:32:08,840
Mario discovers a cave full of gold, but he needs a P-switch to reach it.

1136
05:32:09,720 --> 05:32:36,340
Is it a storyline one? I probably shouldn't have done that. Okay. Hold on. Let me look.

1137
05:32:37,060 --> 05:32:46,919
Uh, what's down here? Oh, I just dropped the big one.

1138
05:32:51,939 --> 05:32:55,299
Oh, I should not have done that. I should not have done that.

1139
05:32:57,500 --> 05:33:10,860
Is this a new motorcycle ride fun? Did I ride it yet? I'm just gonna go through here.

1140
05:33:11,500 --> 05:33:37,529
Well, that was bad. It's good. All right. Um, I think I have to go down here. Really?

1141
05:33:37,529 --> 05:33:44,439
Yeah. The Hagrid out of the new universal ride. Yeah. I'm surprised more people didn't know what

1142
05:33:44,439 --> 05:34:20,459
I was talking about. I got a one-up on it. I got the P-block. I did it, right? That's it. What am

1143
05:34:20,459 --> 05:34:57,580
I standing still for? I feel like I'm doing like the secret. I feel like I'm doing the secret part.

1144
05:34:57,580 --> 05:35:59,939
Uh-oh. He shook me. Should I just bring this with me? All right. I did it. Oh shit. I did it.

1145
05:35:59,939 --> 05:36:18,180
All right. I feel like there was a few ways to go there. Short and sweet. That was pretty short.

1146
05:36:22,090 --> 05:36:38,250
All right. We got this one. Here's the correct spelling. M-G-B-4-C-6. M-G-B-4-C-6-T-W-G.

1147
05:36:43,369 --> 05:36:48,840
There we go. Okay. Bob-omb mansion. Short and sweet. This one is pretty explosive.

1148
05:36:49,560 --> 05:37:14,139
Let's take a look. First day of work and I dropped the vase on the ground.

1149
05:37:14,139 --> 05:37:29,189
Okay. I'm just gonna get over that. Do I need to do something with these?

1150
05:37:29,830 --> 05:37:32,229
I feel like you wouldn't have bombs if I wasn't gonna need to use them.

1151
05:37:32,389 --> 05:38:09,990
I can't fucking believe I missed that jump. That's one way to do it. Wait.

1152
05:38:24,860 --> 05:38:44,919
Ah. Oh yeah. I didn't see the other one. No. The chomp did it. I didn't see it. That's good.

1153
05:38:45,560 --> 05:38:50,650
This is a pretty good placement of the, uh, of the Bob-ombs, I will say.

1154
05:38:51,290 --> 05:39:07,529
They kind of just, they just barely get right in the way. Pretty good. Almost fucking blew that one.

1155
05:39:08,409 --> 05:39:38,950
All right. Hold on. Upside down P. Hit it. I knew I was gonna need this. Y'all thought I

1156
05:39:38,950 --> 05:39:44,650
wasn't gonna need that and I, I brought, I got it. Now I got Yoshi. What do I do with Yoshi now?

1157
05:39:44,650 --> 05:40:23,819
Uh, melt. All right. Hold on here. Checkpoint. Nice. I do have to say, I don't want to lose

1158
05:40:23,819 --> 05:40:35,130
Yoshi though because I'm not gonna get him at the checkpoint. Uh, I was off screen, so.

1159
05:40:37,880 --> 05:40:43,270
It's all right. I got an extra, I get to take an extra hit. Let me see what this looks like. Hold

1160
05:40:43,270 --> 05:41:10,220
on. Shit. Go. Damage boost. Oh my god. It's the end. I win. Clever. Clever. That's pretty good.

1161
05:41:10,220 --> 05:41:24,819
Bob-omb mansion. Very cool. Thank you. This one is, uh, the man on a mission, the level, the movie.

1162
05:41:25,700 --> 05:41:45,479
This is piquing my curiosity. Let's see what this does. The level, the movie. KMG. Mario goes to the

1163
05:41:45,479 --> 05:42:05,779
store for milk. All right. Uh, sorry. A zeppelin just flew by. All right. Uh, go to the store and

1164
05:42:05,779 --> 05:42:23,110
get the milk. Reached the goal after defeating all the booms. What the absolute fuck is that?

1165
05:42:33,029 --> 05:43:20,650
Oh, that's not good. How do I break the ice? Let's go. I'm going real fast. Can you actually

1166
05:43:20,650 --> 05:43:51,130
crash the car and die? It's too soft. I can't. What else you got? Let's go. This level made me cry

1167
05:43:51,130 --> 05:44:12,310
tears of joy. I'll check it out. Thank you for the level, by the way. Escape from Peerthorn

1168
05:44:12,310 --> 05:44:15,909
Perch. Can you escape the tricky jungle of spiky peerthorn trees? Water is rising.

1169
05:44:16,869 --> 05:44:33,860
Okay. Let's go. Try again. Remember we were talking about how, like, uh, did I say something

1170
05:44:33,860 --> 05:44:39,349
earlier about, like, a pizza? I said earlier that I was gonna eat, like, a large pizza or something,

1171
05:44:39,349 --> 05:45:23,849
didn't I? Um, did the guys have to get all the coins? I'm not, I'm not gonna make this. I didn't even try.

1172
05:45:30,860 --> 05:45:33,580
I'm not gonna eat a chicken on stream again. That's not gonna be the thing.

1173
05:45:34,380 --> 05:45:50,299
Is the audio a bit early? Yeah, I don't know why. Especially the switch for some reason

1174
05:45:50,939 --> 05:45:55,500
when I pull through this capture card. Is that a sink? I think it happens sometimes with other

1175
05:45:55,500 --> 05:46:01,819
ones too, but not. I feel like it's a switch thing. At least on my whatever I have for a setup here.

1176
05:46:11,060 --> 05:46:21,340
No. Any other compulsive jumpers in Mario? Like, I jump. I land on a surface. Jump. Okay.

1177
05:46:22,220 --> 05:46:33,540
I'm a compulsive jumper. I need to hit a blue switch somewhere.

1178
05:46:34,099 --> 05:46:56,040
Looks like it's over here. There it is. Let's kind of shoot out of there. Shell. But why

1179
05:46:56,919 --> 05:46:58,919
do I need a shell? I guess I could go like this.

1180
05:47:03,189 --> 05:47:06,630
Anybody else here an idiot too? No, just me. Get out of here. Give me a break.

1181
05:47:07,349 --> 05:47:15,720
Get out of here. Get out of here with that shit. Come on. Get out of here. Like, come on. Really?

1182
05:47:45,590 --> 05:48:04,619
I don't want to kill this because I don't know what's in that box. What was the point of that?

1183
05:48:04,619 --> 05:48:08,860
Get back up there quickly, I guess, to hit the switch. Really? Why did you turn so rapidly?

1184
05:48:09,979 --> 05:48:35,290
Did I pick? I got that one already. That's odd. Okay. I don't know if I'll get it. Three more?

1185
05:48:36,169 --> 05:49:12,040
There's one in there. Load that up. Oh, shit. Oh, no. Now they're gonna get down here. What have I

1186
05:49:12,040 --> 05:49:40,790
done? Well, they're in a nice place. Supposed to do that. Switch is over here. I think now I can

1187
05:49:41,590 --> 05:50:08,779
do this. No. I have to go. It's got to bounce off that. Did I screw the whole thing up? You

1188
05:50:08,779 --> 05:50:24,790
would think it would bounce across, right? I guess I'm just gonna stand down there and do it again.

1189
05:50:24,790 --> 05:51:01,750
What does that achieve for me? What do I just do? Can I jump up here?

1190
05:51:03,830 --> 05:51:07,049
Oh, I can go through this wood. Right, right. Then,

1191
05:51:07,770 --> 05:51:30,060
hold on. Anything change up here? There we go. All right. Two more. I'm thinking I'm thinking

1192
05:51:30,060 --> 05:51:41,209
jump and grab and fall and grab and hold and... Okay. Do I need to blow that up with a bomb?

1193
05:51:41,930 --> 05:51:57,240
Can you... Can I swim? Or am I gonna sink right to the bottom? I don't remember. Okay. I think

1194
05:51:57,240 --> 05:52:20,229
sometimes I forget. All right. On this side? Okay. There's this shit. So that wall is gone.

1195
05:52:23,540 --> 05:52:37,290
What are you gonna fire? Oh, it's a homing missile. Oh, fuck. I'm fine. All right. One more.

1196
05:52:37,849 --> 05:52:46,040
And where is this last one? What's down here? Can I see anything? All right. What is this?

1197
05:52:47,479 --> 05:52:55,209
It's not... All right. Just swim. Just swim. Just swim. Swim. Swim. Swim. Swim. Swim. There's

1198
05:52:55,209 --> 05:53:38,310
one more somewhere. Where's this last one? Uh-oh. Red platform writer. What is this? Go in? What's

1199
05:53:38,310 --> 05:53:47,459
it gonna drop? A bomb. But what do I do with the bomb? I don't have the key. Left. Left. Go left.

1200
05:53:51,939 --> 05:53:54,979
All right. Then I gotta... All right. I'm good. I'm gonna go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

1201
05:53:54,979 --> 05:54:00,459
I get it. Okay. I gotta go down. Take a bomb down. But right down? Straight down?

1202
05:54:01,099 --> 05:54:14,520
This is it. Holy shit. It's already open. I did it already. Nice. Now I got a power block

1203
05:54:16,439 --> 05:54:22,759
and I need to do something with this. What do I need to do with this? What do I do with this?

1204
05:54:23,560 --> 05:54:26,919
I don't know what this wants me to do. Um... Do I kill it? Go in the pipe?

1205
05:54:27,639 --> 05:54:56,220
I have... There's another... Holy shit. This is long. Oh, that's not good. I had to bounce and then grab.

1206
05:54:57,909 --> 05:55:16,040
Oh boy. Okay. So I got it. Now it became a speed run. Why did I not throw that earlier?

1207
05:55:16,040 --> 05:55:38,099
That's what I want to know. Okay. Now what? Oh. Spin. I can just throw it anywhere though, so that's

1208
05:55:38,099 --> 05:55:57,290
fine. Does it go in the water? This whole stream, I'll tell you. Take all the audio clips I've said.

1209
05:55:59,029 --> 05:56:09,669
I might as well be watching golf. Oh. Did it go in the water? Oh, it got trapped. I'm just

1210
05:56:09,669 --> 05:56:32,869
watching fucking golf. Really? Come on. That's bullshit. Bounced off one and hit the other.

1211
05:56:46,580 --> 05:57:05,990
I'm safe. Wait a minute. What's... Other keys. Just no other five keys?

1212
05:57:05,990 --> 05:57:17,990
That was good. Watching golf with the occasional jump scare reaction.

1213
05:57:20,819 --> 05:57:34,099
Yeah, that's when the guy accidentally hits it like way too far and it like soars. That's when

1214
05:57:34,099 --> 05:57:38,819
the guy uses like a three wood instead of a pitching wedge and he like hits it like fucking

1215
05:57:38,819 --> 05:58:10,939
over the building. Yeah, totally. No slack at all tonight, huh? Geez. All right. Let's do...

1216
05:58:12,779 --> 05:58:20,599
What about the times when I yell? Well, I'm trying to fuck the guy up that's hitting the ball.

1217
05:58:21,479 --> 05:58:32,540
Right? When he goes down, I go like... Now I get fucking thrown out. All right. Epic cool level.

1218
05:58:32,540 --> 05:59:10,090
Okay. Let's try this one. No, no, no. 50H. What the hell is this? Did I just type in somebody's

1219
05:59:10,090 --> 05:59:16,090
fucking like password? Did I just like get into somebody's account? Was that like your account

1220
05:59:16,090 --> 05:59:48,229
login? Okay. I made this for you. All right. We'll do this one. 13. Why does this one look

1221
05:59:48,229 --> 05:59:55,080
familiar? Did I do this one already? What is that? Of course it looks familiar and it's died to

1222
05:59:55,080 --> 06:00:33,479
pinwheel. Okay. All right. Your skills astound me. Here we go. This one looks normal. This one looks

1223
06:00:33,479 --> 06:01:03,080
normal and not like this. Okay. All right. Try this level. I feel like that one would be fun.

1224
06:01:03,080 --> 06:01:09,959
I feel like 30 or 40 of those, which is those. All right. Wait, wait, wait. Let's do this one.

1225
06:01:09,959 --> 06:01:35,259
This one looks normal. I think this is a normal one. Boing gear tower. All right. This one is real

1226
06:01:35,259 --> 06:01:55,909
and it's also apparently very hard. Solve and scale the highest tower. Sorry. I had to stop.

1227
06:01:55,909 --> 06:02:07,459
All right. Where are we going? Scale the tower. Obviously I have to do that. This looks complicated.

1228
06:02:07,459 --> 06:02:55,220
I might just veto this one. How do I? I think I had to try this one more time.

1229
06:02:55,220 --> 06:03:00,259
Damage run it maybe? Or does it matter which one of these I go into? Or

1230
06:03:01,220 --> 06:03:19,610
probably not. I'm assuming I probably have to damage run this. Let's go. I'm missing something.

1231
06:03:20,409 --> 06:04:20,459
This one is different. I'm way too fast. Fuck. Oh shit. Look out. I'm Zeppelin. I think I got it.

1232
06:04:20,459 --> 06:04:28,810
And then the thing shoots. Ah. It's just a P. It's just a P block. It's not a big deal. Now that'll

1233
06:04:28,810 --> 06:04:36,299
give me the... I have this now. Should I take them both? I can't take them both. All right. Now

1234
06:04:37,819 --> 06:05:16,150
this one... I don't think it's this one. Throw the spring over here. Oh. What happened? Did I do it?

1235
06:05:17,290 --> 06:05:20,650
Oh. Okay. I gotta get them all. All right. No, no, no. All right. So that's that one. Now we

1236
06:05:20,650 --> 06:06:07,029
get to do this one. So now... All right. Get... Bring it. Nothing gonna kill me? How do I get this

1237
06:06:07,029 --> 06:06:41,500
down? So that means should I kill the... No. That was what I just did. I need to throw the bomb.

1238
06:06:42,459 --> 06:06:59,659
I have to keep pushing the thwomp. Yeah. But I mean, how do I do that?

1239
06:07:00,779 --> 06:07:09,740
I was thinking throw a bomb down there. Let me look at this again.

1240
06:07:13,639 --> 06:07:40,569
Okay. Are you serious? That... Do it again. Only two more. If I die, it's over.

1241
06:07:45,400 --> 06:07:48,439
Now this is the one that I was doing... All right. I have no idea how to do this one.

1242
06:07:50,409 --> 06:08:10,680
Get up here. And then somehow I have to hit this. But how do I grab that? Because I can't jump

1243
06:08:10,680 --> 06:08:58,659
through. Will he hit this? I felt like that was pretty good. Okay. So now this is where I can die.

1244
06:08:58,659 --> 06:09:05,180
This is bad. Because I don't have any checkpoints. Is this... It's this or that's it? It's over.

1245
06:09:06,139 --> 06:09:12,840
Do I have to go down? Pull it up. Go down. And then... I don't know. I have no idea how the fuck to

1246
06:09:12,840 --> 06:09:31,819
get over there. I get one shot. Climb up. Climb down. Do I have to make that thing fall? One shot.

1247
06:09:31,819 --> 06:09:59,799
Here we go. What? Did that really just happen? I was... Hold on. I need to see that again.

1248
06:10:01,209 --> 06:10:06,650
That was dog shit. That... Come on. That was not cool. What? I'm actually... I'm pretty mad about

1249
06:10:06,650 --> 06:10:25,990
that. Apparently. I have to stand on that. Yeah. I have to get on... Stand on it. Well, I'm gonna...

1250
06:10:25,990 --> 06:10:43,209
This one's first. The other ones aren't that hard. I'm gonna do it. But then when it comes back,

1251
06:10:43,209 --> 06:10:55,909
what am I supposed to do? Like here. Yeah. You gotta... You gotta go up. You gotta go down. When

1252
06:10:55,909 --> 06:11:09,459
it goes up, you gotta go up. When it goes down, like yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. You gotta fit yourself

1253
06:11:09,459 --> 06:11:23,080
in the slot. Whatever one it's currently on. I'm trying to go fast. No. I shouldn't be doing that.

1254
06:11:34,819 --> 06:11:52,810
Hasty. Hasty. Hasty. What the fuck? What? I don't... I don't want to stay on it.

1255
06:11:57,580 --> 06:12:07,509
It's killing me. I have to do this. It's... You got this little tiny margin. Damn it. Damn it.

1256
06:12:08,310 --> 06:12:39,849
Ah. Look how far away I am. What is with that? I'm not even close. All right. Let's go.

1257
06:12:40,650 --> 06:12:46,630
The other ones are not that hard. I should be able to do them without a problem.

1258
06:12:53,959 --> 06:13:01,849
What is this one? I haven't seen this one yet either. Might as well figure out how to do them

1259
06:13:01,849 --> 06:13:14,279
all. All right. So the theory here is to get this down, I have to throw it? Just throw it down there

1260
06:13:14,279 --> 06:13:26,810
and then... But do I jump down with this and then throw it over? How am I supposed to get to the

1261
06:13:26,810 --> 06:13:51,560
right? Then now I can just... No. But how? I gotta go backwards to the blocks. Just drop. Bingo.

1262
06:13:52,700 --> 06:14:11,340
Down deal. Two more. Don't accidentally hit this pipe. This one... I know how to do this one. Right.

1263
06:14:11,340 --> 06:14:16,860
I remember. Yeah. Oh. This one actually... I can die here. This one's kind of wonky. I can die here.

1264
06:14:17,740 --> 06:14:50,259
Give me another one. That was painful. It was. That was painful, but I don't want to do it again.

1265
06:14:50,979 --> 06:14:55,459
It was not that bad. It was good. That level was good. I had it, but I just... I don't want to do...

1266
06:14:55,459 --> 06:15:14,779
Oh. I don't want to do it again. Damn it. That one was fun. I knew that there was a big push there and...

1267
06:15:16,299 --> 06:15:26,650
Let's do this one. What time is it? All right. We'll do a few more in the night. We gotta call it.

1268
06:15:26,650 --> 06:15:40,659
It's getting late. Zero g d. I will be back tomorrow with... That's a good question.

1269
06:15:45,139 --> 06:16:07,509
Meowzer's four challenges. Complete each diverse challenge and race Meowzer to the finish. Guys,

1270
06:16:07,509 --> 06:16:24,630
isn't tomorrow Terraria Day? I'm gonna have to talk to Star. It was supposed to be either

1271
06:16:25,509 --> 06:16:28,549
tomorrow or Saturday or Saturday or depending on what he's doing.

1272
06:16:29,509 --> 06:16:33,900
Maybe it's tomorrow. If he's around tomorrow and wants to do it tomorrow, we'll do it tomorrow.

1273
06:16:33,900 --> 06:16:47,450
There's gotta be a reason for this. Of course there is.

1274
06:16:51,049 --> 06:17:17,700
This is cheating now. He must have watched Evo. Oh, fuck. Evo is this weekend. Oh, no.

1275
06:17:18,259 --> 06:17:30,330
I got too much stuff to do. Oh, no. I wanted to go. It's like right here. I gotta get on a plane

1276
06:17:30,330 --> 06:17:35,610
and like go to this robotics facility. Evo is this weekend. Why is there so much stuff going on?

1277
06:17:36,569 --> 06:18:03,380
Oh, did I get trolled? Was that like a joke? What? What? What happened? Oh, that was in one

1278
06:18:03,380 --> 06:18:45,349
of the trials. I was supposed to go back up. When does Evo... It was ice cubes. I'm dead.

1279
06:18:46,389 --> 06:18:53,450
Starts at 10 a.m. tomorrow. Well, no. I got... I'm not gonna go. I got too much going on.

1280
06:18:54,970 --> 06:19:23,479
It's all weekend? Yeah, but I can't because I'm streaming. I'm gonna be streaming today,

1281
06:19:23,479 --> 06:19:29,720
tomorrow, and the next day. I might be able to pop over there on Sunday, but then next week I'm

1282
06:19:29,720 --> 06:19:36,490
gonna go. I'm going to... I'm going across the country to work on the carnival stream at the

1283
06:19:36,490 --> 06:19:43,000
facility where it's happening. So I don't... Wait, give me the fly. Give me the fly. I'm not just

1284
06:19:43,000 --> 06:19:53,290
gonna not stream. Maybe I'll just go watch the finals. That's a whole separate event, right?

1285
06:19:53,290 --> 06:20:19,720
The finals. Should I stay in the car? I don't know why I'm still in the car. Depends on what

1286
06:20:19,720 --> 06:20:45,029
game. I do need the car. Am I too small to get in there now? Oh, thank God. All right, back out.

1287
06:20:45,029 --> 06:20:58,330
Evo sold out. Oh, well, there you go. Never mind. Scream the finals on your channel like you did

1288
06:20:58,330 --> 06:21:04,869
with E3. I don't... I'm not sure you were allowed to co-stream that. I don't have any idea what the

1289
06:21:04,869 --> 06:21:10,869
hell I'm talking about. I would not be able to commentate like Street Fighter gameplay.

1290
06:21:10,869 --> 06:21:32,490
Okay. No, I wouldn't want to do that. Just let him fall down there and just do it.

1291
06:21:33,130 --> 06:22:14,409
I need that. Two more. Easy. What? No! He was a different... He was a different... I didn't... I

1292
06:22:14,409 --> 06:22:26,419
thought... I thought he took a long time to shoot that. He took... He took his time to shoot that.

1293
06:22:27,560 --> 06:22:53,799
Fuck, that one was fun, too. Tina Belcher? All right, it's almost time to go.

1294
06:22:56,970 --> 06:23:00,919
I feel like I did that a lot today, too. All right, let's do...

1295
06:23:02,659 --> 06:23:16,650
This one's a relaxing level. Who knows if they're alive or not. W-P-T. Y-J-5.

1296
06:23:19,560 --> 06:23:31,319
L-K-G. Seven Heaven. Traverse Bowser Jr.'s fleet. Watch out for the cannonballs.

1297
06:23:32,279 --> 06:23:49,020
Is this Cake Mario? No. This is not Cake Mario. It's not my favorite Mario.

1298
06:23:51,659 --> 06:24:00,360
Got big. It got small. I don't need it. I don't need it for these auto-scrollers.

1299
06:24:04,569 --> 06:24:27,939
No. Fire. Watch out. Got it. This is it. What a nice level. Kind of relaxing and just fun.

1300
06:24:28,740 --> 06:24:41,580
Just jump around and jump on stuff. Watch out for the fire. Get the goombas. I thought that was a

1301
06:24:41,659 --> 06:25:07,139
ground. Where are you going? Guys. Guys. Okay. It might be time for me to pull the plug.

1302
06:25:11,130 --> 06:25:16,250
I don't know what it is. Mario is such like a fun family game. But when I play it,

1303
06:25:16,970 --> 06:26:05,139
I feel like I smoked a pack of cigarettes. That was a good one. Let me try to get a good jump.

1304
06:26:05,139 --> 06:26:24,069
That was a four out of ten. What time is it? We can do two more. Two more. Six and a half hours.

1305
06:26:24,069 --> 06:26:33,020
We're good. We can do like two more. Somebody said here's a baby level. Wait. Hold on. There's

1306
06:26:33,020 --> 06:26:39,159
cool level with wrenches. Let me do this one first. He's addicted. Well, it's kind of just fun to see

1307
06:26:39,159 --> 06:27:03,700
what people make. This one has wrenches. Escaping the P-Mole Fortress. Use their P-Block against

1308
06:27:03,700 --> 06:27:24,380
them. Use the P-Block against them. And it's also got this lava here. That deer right there has

1309
06:27:24,380 --> 06:27:28,860
wrenches in this level. Means it gets an automatic one point letter grade higher. I can't even make

1310
06:27:28,860 --> 06:28:09,240
this jump. I have to stop looking at fucking chat. Oh you guys. What the fuck. All right. Let's go.

1311
06:28:16,169 --> 06:28:23,979
Am I still here? Are you still alive, man? Are you still with me? Am I going to get that smell

1312
06:28:23,979 --> 06:28:40,259
thing that the people put in your nose and makes you go, I'm alive now. It's all about these blocks.

1313
06:28:41,799 --> 06:28:44,919
The car is leaving without me. They're going on vacation without me. I don't even have my fucking

1314
06:28:44,919 --> 06:29:09,049
backpack. That's unbelievable. What happens if they go all the way? Oh. Anybody figure this out?

1315
06:29:09,770 --> 06:29:40,419
Look at all those. Look at all those fucking ribbons. Whatever they are.

1316
06:29:40,419 --> 06:29:53,000
Holy shit. How am I supposed to do that? Oh man. No. Come back. Come back. Where's the switch?

1317
06:29:53,560 --> 06:30:09,349
Oh I have to hit the switch right. Holy shit. I have to just dodge until it gets all the way

1318
06:30:09,349 --> 06:30:23,139
over there. I have to tap it and wait. I have to wait for one pass of ribbons right here. Don't

1319
06:30:23,139 --> 06:30:32,659
go anywhere. Touch it. Now I have to wait. What the. That was impossible. That was an

1320
06:30:32,659 --> 06:30:38,060
uncompletable. That was an uncompletable bow tie pasta right there. I'm sorry.

1321
06:30:38,060 --> 06:30:55,290
Another night. Where was I supposed to go? All right. Come on. One more pass and that's it.

1322
06:30:55,930 --> 06:31:26,279
Oh shit. I need that. That's fire. Give me that. Just damage boost. Oh I fucking panicked.

1323
06:31:27,000 --> 06:31:45,770
I'm so pissed. That's all right. I'm right here. Oh I'm pissed. Pissed. Do you hear that? He's pissed.

1324
06:31:55,509 --> 06:32:18,630
Give me the mushroom. Come on. Get a mushroom out here right now. Please. Oh this. Fire.

1325
06:32:19,669 --> 06:32:55,849
Right. My goodness. I gotta like bait them up. All right. Get this mushroom and then relax.

1326
06:32:56,569 --> 06:33:04,840
Now wait. They throw two. There it is. Wait for the fire. You gotta be kidding me. Get the other

1327
06:33:04,840 --> 06:33:10,599
mushroom right now. Right now. Why did it not come out? Why did that not come out? I don't understand.

1328
06:33:35,029 --> 06:33:47,049
All right. The fire is what's killing me here. I got plenty of time so just hold on. I can't go.

1329
06:33:47,689 --> 06:34:03,720
I think I just tried to snipe me. I tried to jump off of them and for some reason holding B just

1330
06:34:03,720 --> 06:34:36,150
didn't do anything. I was holding the B button down. Come on.

1331
06:34:49,020 --> 06:34:55,580
I don't know. I don't. They're gonna be everywhere now. I'm in so much trouble. Look at this. They're

1332
06:34:55,580 --> 06:35:11,450
everywhere. Look at this. Did you see this? I have to just go fast. You gotta go as fast as you can

1333
06:35:11,450 --> 06:35:28,090
otherwise they just group up on you. Well not that fast. There's no power button or something

1334
06:35:28,090 --> 06:35:46,619
somewhere. I almost got hit by that. All right. Let me take a second before I just... Well you

1335
06:35:46,619 --> 06:35:55,619
have to go fast because the... Wait. Just get... I was gonna wait for the mushroom. You have to... I

1336
06:35:55,619 --> 06:36:01,139
have to stay... I'm gonna stand on the edge after the fire. There's one square you can stand on.

1337
06:36:03,259 --> 06:36:06,700
My stomach doesn't hit the... By the way if you're curious my stomach just fucking pushed

1338
06:36:06,700 --> 06:36:32,389
forward on the desk and hit R. I didn't think it was on there. It's such a bad spot. No. What the

1339
06:36:32,470 --> 06:36:59,590
fuck? Oh my god. Oh my... What the fuck? Throw him up. Yeah. Up here. Throw him. I know you...

1340
06:37:00,630 --> 06:37:21,990
This fire over here is... And now let me get up here. All right. Hold on right here for a second.

1341
06:37:22,790 --> 06:38:13,080
It's gonna hit me. Wow. Huh? You gotta kill... Okay. You kill him. I killed him. Now we just have...

1342
06:38:13,799 --> 06:38:25,450
I think I have to get down there now. Did it... That one was intense.

1343
06:38:29,500 --> 06:38:34,700
That last spot. That last screen with the vines and the wrenches and the explosions and the...

1344
06:38:35,659 --> 06:38:45,450
I don't know if I can do that one again. That was really cool though. All right.

1345
06:38:47,130 --> 06:39:10,229
We're gonna end it on one more. Yeah. Give me like a Game of Thrones theme song. You can search.

1346
06:39:10,310 --> 06:39:23,689
All right. Let me search then. It's not over. It's not over. It's not over. It's not over.

1347
06:39:23,689 --> 06:39:35,340
How am I searching? Difficulty all. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Get detailed search. Music

1348
06:39:35,340 --> 06:39:47,779
by popularity. Game... Okay. Here we go. Game style. All course theme. That doesn't really matter,

1349
06:39:47,779 --> 06:40:17,740
I guess. Is tags music? There we go. Music. Just music. Okay. Did that work? Oh, by popularity.

1350
06:40:20,599 --> 06:40:28,060
Rhythm challenge. This is a gourmet race. Country roads. Okay. I need to know what this one's like.

1351
06:40:39,259 --> 06:41:10,409
Cake Mario is the best one. Take me home country road.

1352
06:41:26,950 --> 06:42:03,509
That was nice. That was really nice. Fucking up the rhythm. Yeah, I know. At least make the tempo

1353
06:42:03,509 --> 06:42:13,750
consistent. I have one piece. This is that one piece theme song. I'm not sure I've ever even

1354
06:42:13,750 --> 06:42:21,689
heard this before. Wait, I have... It goes, give it up, give it up, give it up. Yeah, yo, yeah, yo.

1355
06:42:21,689 --> 06:42:51,849
Are they gonna do that? His name is Luffy. Right? That's not it. No, they've trapped me in here. I

1356
06:42:51,849 --> 06:43:41,259
can't like run out. I can't get out of here. Is that... Okay, so that's season two. Is this season

1357
06:43:41,259 --> 06:43:59,720
three? No. Oh, that's cool. Oh, that's the pirate ship. Wow, that's neat. Yeah. Star Fox.

1358
06:44:00,970 --> 06:44:34,169
Mortal Kombat. Walk, don't run. Don't tell me what to do. Here we go. Test your fight. What is it?

1359
06:44:34,169 --> 06:44:37,849
It's test your what? What is it? Choose to fight. What is it? What's the actual thing?

1360
06:44:58,790 --> 06:45:26,869
Choose to fight. That's really, really cool. Game of Thrones. The Game of Thrones theme song.

1361
06:45:28,200 --> 06:45:47,060
I'm not gonna click that one. I know everyone's supposed to freak the fuck out. Wait, is this

1362
06:45:47,060 --> 06:45:52,680
gonna... I might want to hear that one.

1363
06:46:07,110 --> 06:46:35,959
Maybe that one too. Train your things. Pizza delivery. All-star. Don't move. Don't move? Okay.

1364
06:47:47,590 --> 06:47:57,939
All right. What do you mean ruined it? That was at the very end. 24 seconds. Somebody... I gotta

1365
06:47:57,939 --> 06:48:23,590
get the speed run on this one. How to train your dragon. Tetris. Mario Maker. Wild. Passes. Sky.

1366
06:48:23,590 --> 06:48:37,110
Peaches. Castle. Quarry. Fountain. Wait, is this the like... I kind of have to know this.

1367
06:48:57,849 --> 06:49:36,819
I want to hear it again. I wanted to hear it again. I want to hear it again. That's really cool.

1368
06:49:37,619 --> 06:49:49,779
No, that's too fast. That's way too fast. Don't... I wouldn't run here.

1369
06:49:51,380 --> 06:50:34,180
It's gonna be slower. Maybe not. What song is it backwards? Sounds pretty much the same.

1370
06:50:37,659 --> 06:51:08,630
That goes forward and backwards the same. All right. One more and that's it. We're gonna do one more

1371
06:51:08,630 --> 06:52:07,299
song. Hotel Mario. Wait, is this the one that goes like... It is, isn't it? Yeah, it is. There's more?

1372
06:52:07,299 --> 06:52:12,900
Wait, I actually have to play this... I have to play this level. There's gameplay in this one,

1373
06:52:12,900 --> 06:52:27,529
guys. Pretty cool. And we're having a lot of spaghetti. That's a thing from like 2008.

1374
06:52:31,900 --> 06:52:58,069
That's it? What was that? I grew up on that meme. I think a lot of people did. That was back when

1375
06:52:58,069 --> 06:53:06,549
YouTube... People would just sentence splice together a bunch of dog shit. There were whole

1376
06:53:06,549 --> 06:53:14,860
communities around just like YouTube poops. That was old. All right, we'll do...

1377
06:53:17,700 --> 06:53:26,279
Donkey Kong. That's it. It was an interesting time. Yeah, you never knew what you were gonna get.

1378
06:53:27,000 --> 06:53:58,979
Kong? Donkey Kong. I almost just fell off. Now it's this Donkey Kong. Well, it's not that one,

1379
06:53:58,979 --> 06:54:39,779
is it? Nice. Where's the... That made me go a million miles per hour. That's right there.

1380
06:54:40,740 --> 06:55:06,869
Is it slippery or what? Whoa, these are... That's not in Mario. That's not in Donkey Kong.

1381
06:55:06,869 --> 06:55:28,740
They don't fire laser beams at you from the cannons. They added that in. This is an

1382
06:55:28,740 --> 06:55:37,580
interpretation of what that was. All right, well, hold on a second here. Now...

1383
06:55:41,900 --> 06:56:03,610
Ah, guys. All right, that was fun. This was a very, very fun stream for me. I enjoyed it.

1384
06:56:03,689 --> 06:56:10,389
This game is a lot of fun. I wish I was better at Mario. I wish I was like a better Mario

1385
06:56:10,389 --> 06:56:24,569
player. It's still fun though. So tomorrow... I'm not sure what's gonna happen tomorrow.

1386
06:56:25,130 --> 06:56:47,380
It's either gonna be Terraria with Star or Sam & Max Season 3 or something else. DOS? Yeah, depends.

1387
06:56:50,700 --> 06:57:00,500
One of those things will be tomorrow. I kind of... Hold on. I want to... Like, hold on a second.

1388
06:57:04,060 --> 06:57:07,900
I'm just curious as to what the big... The really, really popular courses are. All right.

1389
06:57:08,779 --> 06:57:15,369
I mean, let me... Okay, hold on. Planet... Planetary exploration. Let me just see what it is.

1390
06:57:15,369 --> 06:57:18,650
This is like the one of the... This is the most popular course in the world. Let me just see what

1391
06:57:18,650 --> 06:57:36,200
it is. This is the... This is the most popular course in the entire universe. Did we... A raid

1392
06:57:36,200 --> 06:57:46,060
came in? Oh, shit. That was Swordy Way. Thank you, Swordy Way, for the raid. Welcome, guys.

1393
06:57:47,080 --> 06:57:51,319
Is it giving me the middle finger? Oh, it's a rocket ship. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. I died.

1394
06:57:51,319 --> 06:57:57,369
Let me... Hold on. We're about to stop the stream, unfortunately. Sorry.

1395
06:57:58,250 --> 06:58:04,150
But welcome. Hope you had a good stream. All right, let's see. So you get the fire flower

1396
06:58:04,869 --> 06:58:20,220
and then the take off and lift off. All right, there it is. All right, that's cool. I want to

1397
06:58:20,220 --> 06:59:03,590
get right on top. Why is this the most popular? That's cute and interesting. It has a good song.

1398
06:59:04,549 --> 06:59:19,240
That's cute. The rocket ship takes off and you fly. That's nice. That's nice. There's more, too.

1399
06:59:19,240 --> 06:59:26,020
Look at this. It's a jellyfish. Oh, we're on the moon. I get it. He's a moon jellyfish.

1400
06:59:26,740 --> 06:59:57,450
I knew it. This is the best song, too. I don't think they'll ever make a Mario game that has

1401
06:59:57,450 --> 07:00:29,459
a song that's better than this one. They really won't ever. Stop trying to act cool. What? Am I

1402
07:00:29,540 --> 07:01:02,779
out of oxygen? That's a UFO. Oh, Bowser's an alien. I get it. Nice. What's he gonna take me?

1403
07:01:03,500 --> 07:01:29,270
What's he gonna take me? Get on there. That was really cute. That's pretty nice. Wait, batter up,

1404
07:01:29,270 --> 07:01:39,189
swipe the incoming shells. I know the stream's over, but hold on. And it's Cake Mario, so that's

1405
07:01:39,830 --> 07:02:08,790
already a plus two letter grade. Is this for the... I did it. Home run. Oh, this is it.

1406
07:02:09,430 --> 07:02:34,470
You guys don't even think I fucking know what I'm doing. Shit! I need another one. Give me another

1407
07:02:34,470 --> 07:02:53,560
ball. Where are they? Down here? Oh, no. No, do that again. I want to do that again. I fucking love

1408
07:02:53,560 --> 07:03:24,580
Cake Mario. All right. Boink, boink. Now, this one's fast. Oh, the next one is. It's this one

1409
07:03:24,580 --> 07:03:58,650
that's just like boom. Got it. Oh, that was a curve ball. I think the tail is a cape. No,

1410
07:03:58,650 --> 07:04:15,509
I'm saying cake. C-A-K-E, like Cake Mario, not Cape Mario. Let's see. De-stress land. Cake Mario

1411
07:04:15,509 --> 07:04:38,090
again. Back to back. Why do I call it Cake Mario? Do I have to actually explain this?

1412
07:04:40,869 --> 07:04:46,380
Back in like 1997, when you went to the grocery store to buy a birthday cake,

1413
07:04:47,509 --> 07:04:54,819
this is exactly what was in the display. This outline thick... it looked like this.

1414
07:04:55,700 --> 07:05:20,470
This is a grocery store Mario cake from like 1996. I guess I had to explain that. All right. That

1415
07:05:20,470 --> 07:05:25,750
felt good. And plus, he looks like the cake version. He looks like a cake.

1416
07:05:40,330 --> 07:05:43,830
There's another one I can say. This is Cake Mario. That's all you need to know.

1417
07:05:44,549 --> 07:06:49,220
Choo. Oh, why did it stop? No. Stress free. Happy. It's called Hardcore Jumps. And that is it.

1418
07:06:49,220 --> 07:06:56,139
This will take us... this already is seven hours. Never mind. That's back to back to back.

1419
07:06:56,139 --> 07:07:02,540
That's my favorite Mario. I mean, he has... there are other names for this Mario.

1420
07:07:03,259 --> 07:07:09,500
There's Keychain Mario. This is also Keychain Mario. In fact, I would say that the small Mario

1421
07:07:09,500 --> 07:07:15,299
is Keychain Mario. And the big one is Cake Mario. It's for this style.

1422
07:07:33,299 --> 07:07:37,779
At least five people know what I'm talking about. That was fun.

1423
07:07:37,779 --> 07:08:02,939
So we run 10 seconds. I'll try it. Not Cake Mario. Okay. You have to open doors and shit.

1424
07:08:04,060 --> 07:08:27,979
I'm gonna die. I think I'm dead. Open doors. Hit the switch. I can do it. Just kill me.

1425
07:08:43,159 --> 07:09:01,270
All right. Jump. And then down, down, down, down, down, down, down. Oh, that was close.

1426
07:09:02,150 --> 07:09:20,169
I didn't do the spring. Yeah, I'm not done. I want to do a couple more speedy ones.

1427
07:09:21,270 --> 07:09:34,250
Spectacular Sky Sprint. 20 seconds. There he is. Keychain Magnet Mario.

1428
07:09:37,930 --> 07:09:49,900
I just had to run.

1429
07:09:57,979 --> 07:10:29,400
I'm not sure how you do that much faster. Let me try. It's very... it's not hard.

1430
07:10:29,400 --> 07:11:17,220
No. 20 seconds. Teehee 2. Grab all 69 coins. Well, I know where the Teehee comes from.

1431
07:11:19,659 --> 07:12:03,799
Pretty clean. Is it tied? I'm tied for world record. I'm sure everybody is. Okay. Speedrun.

1432
07:12:03,799 --> 07:12:17,740
Here we go. Showstopper. You held right at the start like the world record holder.

1433
07:12:17,900 --> 07:13:24,490
Oh, that was cheeky. All right. What do we got? Short and sweet. Puzzle solving. Solve thing.

1434
07:13:25,369 --> 07:13:34,869
20 second snow run. We're not going to go much longer. Don't worry. Get 120 coins.

1435
07:13:59,659 --> 07:14:24,060
What? Oh, I went over the... Oh, that sucks. Hold on. What are you talking about? Wait. I can't even

1436
07:14:24,060 --> 07:14:27,259
read. I'm not going to read that. But everyone in the chat that can read what you just wrote.

1437
07:14:27,259 --> 07:14:43,659
What are you talking about? It's fucking gross. I don't even know what you mean by that.

1438
07:14:44,220 --> 07:15:12,099
What's wrong with you guys? Why are you writing that? Oh, I like these. Okay. This is only 8%

1439
07:15:12,099 --> 07:15:40,619
completion though. Why? That seems pretty low. Have you done Bowser's big... I've not done that.

1440
07:15:40,619 --> 07:16:05,669
I've not done Bowser's big burrito. Bowser's big bean burrito?

1441
07:16:29,220 --> 07:17:01,900
All right. What is it? What is it? I'll do it after this. What's Bowser's burrito? Is it me?

1442
07:17:01,900 --> 07:17:11,159
That's me. No, it's not. It's another fucking guy with the frog hat on. All right. What is it?

1443
07:17:22,279 --> 07:17:50,389
8 vs 3. Okay. No one. 8 vs 3. W0. 7 vs. Bowser's big bean burrito. What the fuck is this?

1444
07:17:51,110 --> 07:18:25,500
I just wiped out the floor. I think there's going to be a P block for that. What? Oh. I don't

1445
07:18:25,500 --> 07:18:43,849
understand. What are you supposed to do about that ending? Let's be real here. What is that?

1446
07:18:59,000 --> 07:19:05,979
Wait, that goes... I thought maybe I could... What? I pressed the button twice.

1447
07:19:33,259 --> 07:20:08,790
Why did you want to play that? Oh, it's... Oh, did... Dunky made this? No, no. Okay. Okay. I played it.

1448
07:20:08,790 --> 07:20:31,529
Okay. All right. Do 1-1 with a twist. All right. I'll do that one too. And then we're going about

1449
07:20:35,459 --> 07:20:50,090
1-T-W. L-L-B. Uh, 1-S-F. All right. This is it. This is truly the last one.

1450
07:20:50,090 --> 07:20:58,759
This is called 1-W-1-1 slip and slide. Sliding is key for speed. Can you find all three bonus

1451
07:20:58,759 --> 07:22:00,439
super coins? This is not the right one. Well, I'll try this one anyway. This one's fun. Oh shit.

1452
07:22:00,439 --> 07:22:24,229
I wasn't supposed to even do this one. Do the real one? I will. But I'm already through 1-1-W.

1453
07:22:25,509 --> 07:22:41,270
I'm almost halfway there. Shit. Thought I had it. Oh, that's a shitty jump.

1454
07:22:42,069 --> 07:23:04,619
Is there a mushroom in any of these? The audio fucked up? Yeah, it sometimes happens that for a

1455
07:23:04,619 --> 07:23:21,590
while. I'm sorry. It's been off for a long time. So the audio is early. The game audio is early?

1456
07:23:22,790 --> 07:23:35,189
Hold on. What? That's weird. I already have it set to 100 milliseconds to offset it. I have to do

1457
07:23:35,189 --> 07:23:58,709
it again. That's weird. I don't know why it does that. Oh shit. That's bad. Okay. Well,

1458
07:23:58,709 --> 07:24:27,590
I found the dev thing. No, I didn't. All right. That's fine. Not enough momentum. How am I going

1459
07:24:27,590 --> 07:24:39,770
to fit in there? I need to- Oh, I have to try one more time. Damn it. I'm just gonna- I'm going to

1460
07:24:39,770 --> 07:24:44,599
lean back in my chair. That's not going to work. Crouch? I was trying to crouch. I couldn't do it.

1461
07:24:45,400 --> 07:25:26,540
I was trying. I promise I was trying. Hurry up. That's one way to do it. That's how you do it,

1462
07:25:26,540 --> 07:25:31,560
apparently. One way. I said the same thing twice, but different ways. I said another thing the same

1463
07:25:31,560 --> 07:25:49,590
way, but twice. All right. What is the actual one that you guys wanted to see? Do you stand or sit

1464
07:25:49,590 --> 07:25:57,270
when you wipe? Neither. I lurch down and push my ass down into the toilet and shake in the water.

1465
07:25:57,270 --> 07:26:01,509
And then fucking like after like a 10, 20 seconds just lift up and like wipe the rest of my like

1466
07:26:01,509 --> 07:26:21,529
cheeks and shit. Where is the one? I played a hundred courses. Cool. YXL? Is that the one?

1467
07:26:21,529 --> 07:26:34,419
I need to see it like at least a few times. All right. YXL. Hopefully this is the one.

1468
07:26:35,220 --> 07:26:53,080
I think it is. D4C. 1-1 but with a twist. Super Mario Brothers 1-1 with a tiny twist. Are you

1469
07:26:53,080 --> 07:26:58,279
ready for a brand new 1-1 experience? And like three people have beaten this level

1470
07:26:58,279 --> 07:27:13,990
in the fucking world. 0.02 percent. I get a better return on my bank savings account annually

1471
07:27:13,990 --> 07:27:38,729
than that. Just saying. No one's gonna be... What is it? Impossible? Yeah. It looks like it.

1472
07:27:40,729 --> 07:27:47,610
1-1 with a twist. Yeah, it's kind of a very obvious twist. You just threw up shit everywhere. You

1473
07:27:47,610 --> 07:28:02,500
just made it impossible. Well, it's obviously left, right. Okay. Hold on now. Just give me a

1474
07:28:02,500 --> 07:28:12,569
second. Okay. And then that's left. Run all the way to the right. I'm going to do this by timing

1475
07:28:12,569 --> 07:28:34,090
only. One. Yeah. You stay over here for another second. I think you have to... Maybe I think you

1476
07:28:34,090 --> 07:28:50,790
have to jump up onto that one. Onto that base. Yeah. You got to get up on that base and then

1477
07:28:50,790 --> 07:29:01,159
to the right. Hold on. Yeah. All right. Hold on. I'm making progress here very slowly.

1478
07:29:07,509 --> 07:29:18,759
I made progress. I went forward more than I did. Holy shit. I almost just fucking got real damn far.

1479
07:29:18,759 --> 07:29:43,080
All right. Now I'm doing it. I guess you have to jump. You got to get faster than that. And

1480
07:29:43,080 --> 07:29:46,680
you get a straight shot over there. I think you have to jump up on top of the... You know what

1481
07:29:46,680 --> 07:29:56,470
I mean? Yep. I got to go faster than that. I had it. I had progress. Come on. What's the time on

1482
07:29:56,470 --> 07:30:22,439
this one? Like 10 seconds? Progress. I got to go early. I had to get that fucking time. I was going

1483
07:30:22,520 --> 07:30:36,810
so fast. This is jump over it? I think you jump over it. Yeah. You have to jump all the way over

1484
07:30:36,810 --> 07:30:55,270
it. Otherwise you hit by that one. No. Caught on. There it was. There it was. No. That's it. I had

1485
07:30:55,270 --> 07:31:03,340
it right. You got to jump over it and then you got to keep running. I had it right. You got to go

1486
07:31:03,340 --> 07:31:29,880
clean over it and then run. That was it. But it's got to be a little bit hair later. Later than that

1487
07:31:29,880 --> 07:31:44,259
too. I was almost there. I just need to get... Look where everyone's dying. I have to get like

1488
07:31:44,259 --> 07:32:08,439
at least past this one part. I wonder if you jump up or if you have to just wait. I have a better

1489
07:32:08,439 --> 07:32:36,139
idea. Silent. Watch this. I have to make it all the way over there so we don't hear like this.

1490
07:32:46,139 --> 07:33:10,470
Ten more tries and then I'm done. Oh wait. They can hear me. Usually I can do that and you guys

1491
07:33:10,470 --> 07:33:27,779
do the game audio. We'll block it out. I can't get this first jump now. No. I can't. Maybe I should

1492
07:33:27,779 --> 07:33:48,580
go over? No. I have to have to do it like this. That was it. I almost went too fast.

1493
07:34:01,209 --> 07:34:12,939
No. Am I going too late? Maybe I'm going too late. I am going too late. I gotta jump over that.

1494
07:34:12,939 --> 07:34:23,139
All right. I gotta jump over that. I gotta go way earlier. Shit. I got caught on the stupid

1495
07:34:23,139 --> 07:34:53,880
fucking metal thing. Why would anybody sit here and beat this? Holy shit. Is that safe over here?

1496
07:34:53,880 --> 07:35:17,720
I got a coin. Nowhere is safe. I feel like that wasn't even there before.

1497
07:35:17,720 --> 07:35:24,500
It's safe! No it's not. Oh you have to. Okay so you have to wait, run, and then jump to the right.

1498
07:35:24,500 --> 07:35:31,770
No way. Is that actually what you're supposed to do? Because it's safe in the middle there for a

1499
07:35:31,770 --> 07:35:57,860
second. Yeah you gotta get right over there and jump up. All right. Yeah I don't care. Yeah I'm

1500
07:35:57,860 --> 07:36:11,419
done. I don't give a shit. Who cares? Damn it. I just want to get to the pipe. If I get to the pipe

1501
07:36:11,419 --> 07:36:14,860
I win. I just want to get to the pipe. That's all I care about. I don't care about anything else.

1502
07:36:14,860 --> 07:36:35,450
It's the pipe. Fuck. I thought I had time to write. Why don't we do this to ourselves? Should I jump

1503
07:36:35,450 --> 07:36:54,220
up? Hold on. Can I? If I go fast enough can I jump on top of that? I don't. Maybe I can. No I can't.

1504
07:36:55,020 --> 07:37:04,500
Maybe? No you can't. No. All right. Three more tries and then I'm going to press the off button

1505
07:37:04,500 --> 07:37:13,340
on the switch because I won't leave if I don't. One. Damn it. That was close. Oh man. You have

1506
07:37:13,340 --> 07:37:20,520
to go all the way to the right and you have to run back. That one didn't count. You have to

1507
07:37:20,520 --> 07:37:31,849
land over here. That's one. Counts. All right. That's two. So I've got to get over there and

1508
07:37:31,849 --> 07:37:39,639
stand there and then run left. How did you know I was pointing at the screen? Wait. How did you know

1509
07:37:39,639 --> 07:37:51,990
I was pointing? I was intensely pointing at the screen. All right. That's two. Here comes three.

1510
07:37:51,990 --> 07:38:03,430
Is it? No. Just let me get over to the right once. That's it. I'm done. I have to turn the

1511
07:38:03,430 --> 07:38:22,259
switch off. All right. That's as far as I'm going to go. Turn off the switch. Okay. I'm good. Let's

1512
07:38:22,259 --> 07:38:42,419
go. That's it. It's too addicting. They make it too addicting. You just have to sit there and

1513
07:38:43,299 --> 07:38:55,880
smash your head against a wall. That's it. Thanks everybody for watching. I will see you guys

1514
07:38:55,880 --> 07:39:01,400
tomorrow. I'm not sure what we're going to do yet. There are plenty of options. Figure it out before

1515
07:39:01,400 --> 07:39:11,979
we start. Same time. So let's go back. Let's do the bits and the subs and everything earlier.

1516
07:39:11,979 --> 07:39:20,779
And thanks for watching. Mario Maker is always a fun time. Mario Maker is a roller coaster of

1517
07:39:20,779 --> 07:39:28,740
emotions for me. I go up and down and up and down and up and down over the course of the whole night.

1518
07:39:29,540 --> 07:39:49,139
But it's always a blast. It is. So back earlier, we had... Let's see here. We had five dollars from

1519
07:39:49,139 --> 07:39:55,189
Kill Ganon. Thank you, Kill Ganon. I don't have much to give, but I made this level specifically

1520
07:39:55,189 --> 07:39:59,349
because I wanted you to play it. And nobody has beaten it yet. Please play it. I'm proud of it.

1521
07:40:00,330 --> 07:40:06,740
Did we do that one? I think we did this one. Does this code is remind... I think I've seen...

1522
07:40:06,740 --> 07:40:27,110
I thought this code earlier. I just like rage turned off my switch. Scamming Mario levels.

1523
07:40:27,750 --> 07:40:40,099
I don't think you played it. Well, here. Here, you guys take this one and let me know how it is.

1524
07:40:40,740 --> 07:40:46,950
I'm just gonna type it because I can't... I apparently can't copy and paste it.

1525
07:40:47,669 --> 07:41:05,029
I feel like I did this one. He beat Bowser's big bean burrito. Yeah, I did. But sorry,

1526
07:41:05,029 --> 07:41:11,669
I didn't get to your level if I didn't. I wasn't doing donations for levels except for the one

1527
07:41:11,669 --> 07:41:16,330
time because the person put a fish in their comments. So I was kind of just pulling them

1528
07:41:16,330 --> 07:41:25,349
out of chat. So thank you for the five dollars. Really appreciate it. Thank you to Dork Cube for

1529
07:41:25,349 --> 07:41:30,470
the 250. How did you get the carnival stream off the ground this quick? But years of the blue

1530
07:41:30,470 --> 07:41:43,400
toothbrush already went over it, but thank you again for the 250. Appreciate it. Thank you to

1531
07:41:43,400 --> 07:41:50,680
Uncle Joe for the 250. Not able to catch the whole stream, but I made a remix for all the zoomers in

1532
07:41:50,680 --> 07:42:04,200
chat. Let me disconnect this. Oh, I just like punched my monitor. I just saw the crystal goo

1533
07:42:04,200 --> 07:42:10,490
shit for like flash. All right, it's fine. No, it's not. It's broken. I actually just broke the

1534
07:42:10,490 --> 07:42:16,659
monitor. I pulled out my headphones and my index finger just bumped it and it like broke the edge

1535
07:42:16,659 --> 07:42:21,270
here. Not enough to be noticeable, but enough where I'm going to look at it and go I'm an idiot

1536
07:42:21,270 --> 07:42:29,639
and I hate that. It's just a tiny little bit in the corner. It's fine. It may actually have even

1537
07:42:29,639 --> 07:42:40,869
been there before and I just noticed it now. Shit. Oh, that was definitely there before. Oh no,

1538
07:42:40,869 --> 07:42:45,849
I mean, I'm even stupider. That's part of the desktop background. Yeah, that's a star in the

1539
07:42:45,849 --> 07:42:52,860
sky on the desktop background, I think. I'll have to check that out later. But here is a remix. It's

1540
07:42:52,860 --> 07:43:12,310
a SoundCloud link. I need to be able to hear this though. Copy that link. Turn this down a little

1541
07:44:27,060 --> 07:44:32,919
That's pretty good. Here's the link for all you that want it.

1542
07:44:36,229 --> 07:44:42,020
Thank you for that, Uncle Joe. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1543
07:44:48,919 --> 07:44:54,279
And then Zeke gave 250. Thank you, Zeke. This is probably the most wholesome video ever. Please

1544
07:44:54,279 --> 07:45:07,130
watch this with the stream. Oh, this is like that. Completely honest here. It's so bright out right

1545
07:45:07,130 --> 07:45:11,610
now because the sun is shining on the snow. There's laser beams shooting into my eyes.

1546
07:45:19,369 --> 07:45:32,180
You all right, Jeremy? Laser beams. Laser beams. I used to have to hang around with

1547
07:45:32,819 --> 07:45:39,159
chat for a long time and other people that weren't from the area. I lost a huge amount of my like

1548
07:45:39,159 --> 07:45:52,459
Boston accent. Laser beams. It used to be so much heavier. It still comes up from time to time. It

1549
07:45:52,459 --> 07:46:05,669
still does. I'm not going to watch this whole video. Say room. Room. I mean, yeah. If you have

1550
07:46:05,669 --> 07:46:10,500
like an English accent, you can't just like stop having it. Yeah. And okay. Yeah. Spider-Man is

1551
07:46:10,500 --> 07:46:14,979
really good at that. He can do that pretty well. But not all of us are like Academy Award winning

1552
07:46:14,979 --> 07:46:26,259
actors. Yes. There are two people that you know. They're Dr. Greghouse and Spider-Man are really,

1553
07:46:26,259 --> 07:46:35,639
really good at it. And the guy that played the big, the guy that played the dragon in Lord of the

1554
07:46:35,639 --> 07:46:51,299
Rings. Mr. Strange. Dr. Strange. Say popcorn. Popcorn. Popcorn. What's wrong with that?

1555
07:46:51,860 --> 07:47:03,799
I think you beat the 250. Thank you to Spamite for $3. Play my level or else I'll remove your

1556
07:47:03,799 --> 07:47:10,650
gamer privileges. I'm sorry I was not doing donations for levels. The one person gave $50

1557
07:47:10,650 --> 07:47:14,659
and put a fish in their comment and that's the only one I did. I kind of wanted this to be

1558
07:47:15,459 --> 07:47:21,930
throw them in here and we'll play them. But I do appreciate the level and hopefully I did get to

1559
07:47:21,930 --> 07:47:26,779
at least one of them because I did do a lot. I did probably at least like 20 or so. 20 or 30.

1560
07:47:29,590 --> 07:47:43,799
$50 for levels. Popcorn. Popcorn. Popcorn. Thank you for the $3 Spamite.

1561
07:47:48,009 --> 07:47:53,770
Editing your streams has given me 4% Boston accent. Max accent is probably now 20% Boston,

1562
07:47:53,770 --> 07:48:05,770
70% British, and 10% normal. What is normal? Hey Swyd. Thanks for the $5 Swyd Harry. Hey

1563
07:48:05,770 --> 07:48:11,020
Jerma. Are you going to be at Evo? I don't know. I don't know. It's going to be tough

1564
07:48:12,409 --> 07:48:19,930
because today is what Thursday? So Thursday, Friday, Saturday. I plan on streaming three

1565
07:48:19,930 --> 07:48:26,119
days in a row but I might I don't know because I'm not going to be here. I'm not going to be here

1566
07:48:26,119 --> 07:48:33,979
next week for at least a couple days. So it's going to be kind of it's going to be hard to go

1567
07:48:33,979 --> 07:48:46,009
to Evo. I might try to show up on Sunday just to kind of pop around. But if you weren't here earlier

1568
07:48:46,009 --> 07:48:52,330
the reason why I'm not going to be here early next week is I am going to the robot facility

1569
07:48:53,130 --> 07:48:56,150
to we're going to do a walkthrough. We're going to hammer down every single detail.

1570
07:48:56,790 --> 07:49:03,430
I've got to exchange some money and we're going to do some talking. We're going to go over everything.

1571
07:49:03,430 --> 07:49:11,419
I want to kind of just be like a name to a face rather than just because I want to know. I kind

1572
07:49:11,419 --> 07:49:14,220
of want to see what's going on. I see what they're doing. See the progress and stuff.

1573
07:49:15,020 --> 07:49:26,259
So I don't just want to be like hey let's do all that stuff and then hey I'll see you in September.

1574
07:49:26,259 --> 07:49:33,080
By the way September 21st is the day of that stream. Not likely to really be changed. I don't

1575
07:49:33,080 --> 07:49:37,240
think that's going to happen. It seems pretty unlikely because there's like three companies

1576
07:49:37,240 --> 07:49:44,099
involved. So it's not a case of like you know I feel like doing it on next Thursday.

1577
07:49:44,819 --> 07:49:49,299
So there was way too many people involved. So it's Saturday. It's going to be Saturday the 21st. I

1578
07:49:49,299 --> 07:49:59,459
believe it's Saturday. Is that a Saturday? I think it is. Yeah the 21st Saturday September.

1579
07:50:06,069 --> 07:50:09,750
What does the carnival stream mean? I'll give you a quick little rundown.

1580
07:50:10,470 --> 07:50:19,180
September 21st I am going to a robot warehouse facility to collaborate with a group of engineers.

1581
07:50:19,180 --> 07:50:22,380
Oh they already would have made them. That's what this next week is for.

1582
07:50:22,939 --> 07:50:30,099
To make a bunch of robots with another company. To then make them controllable by Twitch. To play

1583
07:50:30,659 --> 07:50:36,259
a bunch of carnival games. One of which the main attraction is to dunk me in a dunk tank with a

1584
07:50:36,259 --> 07:50:57,720
pitching machine. It's one of them. And yeah and they're all the robots are going to be controlled

1585
07:50:57,720 --> 07:51:03,909
by Twitch. Midway games, carnival games, there's going to be a bunch of them. There's going to be

1586
07:51:03,909 --> 07:51:08,470
at least a few different robots that you're going to be able to control as a collective group. Let's

1587
07:51:08,470 --> 07:51:17,099
hope you can do it. How did you find the people to do this for you? This has taken a year to figure

1588
07:51:17,099 --> 07:51:25,400
this out. I have wanted to do this stream since summertime before I moved to Vegas.

1589
07:51:26,040 --> 07:51:49,380
Is it going to be one game at a time? Yes. It's going to be a big carnival with a midway,

1590
07:51:49,380 --> 07:51:54,979
different all these booths. There might be other things there, other machines to mess around with.

1591
07:51:56,099 --> 07:52:00,180
Over the course of the day the stream is probably going to be, well it depends on how good you guys

1592
07:52:00,180 --> 07:52:10,819
can play. I mean we might have to, I don't know, if you guys can dunk me in like 10 seconds then

1593
07:52:10,819 --> 07:52:18,500
all right. We'll see how many times you guys can do it. In before it's a bit it is not. I can assure

1594
07:52:18,500 --> 07:52:24,389
you of that. These are real robots, really controlled by you guys, really happening on the

1595
07:52:24,389 --> 07:52:30,490
21st. It's not a bit. I can promise you that. I mean they might be jokes in that stream but that

1596
07:52:30,490 --> 07:52:41,240
is actually for real. That's not like a joke. You will be able to do that. Judging by chat's

1597
07:52:41,240 --> 07:52:44,279
pick cross ability, I don't think we're going to be very, you're not going to have to worry about

1598
07:52:44,279 --> 07:53:06,099
that. You're going to put any protective measures in there. We have a bunch of ways to,

1599
07:53:09,770 --> 07:53:14,569
the way that I was described to me, the way that we talked about it, is we can set it,

1600
07:53:15,209 --> 07:53:18,889
the different inputs, to have to have a certain amount of inputs for it to work.

1601
07:53:18,889 --> 07:53:24,889
So let's say for instance, let's say that it's going really crazy and there's like 20,000 inputs

1602
07:53:24,889 --> 07:53:33,049
and like 20,000 of them like to go left, right? We can make it so there has to be a certain amount

1603
07:53:33,049 --> 07:53:38,810
to make it even move an inch left. You know what I'm saying? We can kind of mitigate like huge,

1604
07:53:38,810 --> 07:53:46,490
huge just spam by making, let's say, oh turn left, needs like 3,000 inputs to go left an inch.

1605
07:53:46,490 --> 07:53:50,729
But right could be like two inputs. We might just have fun. We might fuck around with it.

1606
07:53:51,689 --> 07:54:01,459
The people that are working with me on this have done shit like this before, so they're very

1607
07:54:01,459 --> 07:54:08,490
knowledgeable on how all this will work. They seem to be very, very much in touch with what we want

1608
07:54:08,490 --> 07:54:27,099
to do. Do you get tickets? No, not yet. I've kind of fought with the idea of should I do a thing

1609
07:54:27,099 --> 07:54:31,900
where you like give bits and you can like play a game or something. I don't want to do that.

1610
07:54:32,860 --> 07:54:35,340
I feel like it's more fun when everyone's kind of fighting with each other.

1611
07:54:38,200 --> 07:54:44,360
It was also an idea of like have a separate segment that was, oh you have to, if you pay

1612
07:54:44,360 --> 07:54:49,479
money, you only are the one that gets to control the machine for like two or three throws or

1613
07:54:49,479 --> 07:54:59,380
something, right? But then it became, how much money is that? What's that gonna be? Is that a

1614
07:54:59,380 --> 07:55:04,340
dollar? Is that five dollars? Is that ten dollars? And what happens if like five fucking hundred

1615
07:55:04,340 --> 07:55:11,130
people do that? Are you gonna have five hundred people lined up? It's gonna take like 12 hours.

1616
07:55:11,849 --> 07:55:25,000
So I think it's more fun when everybody just kind of can try to control it. Because that

1617
07:55:25,959 --> 07:55:29,639
makes more sense as to the nature of this whole stream in the first place.

1618
07:55:33,610 --> 07:55:38,889
But besides that, there's another way maybe to like, oh if you, one of the things that I

1619
07:55:38,889 --> 07:55:44,330
thought was interesting, remember the, that like cash machine? Remember I told you guys I was like

1620
07:55:44,330 --> 07:55:51,130
really good at it. Maybe if like once every, once like a hundred bucks comes through, I would like

1621
07:55:51,130 --> 07:55:56,729
get in that thing and try to grab them. I don't know. There's a lot of different ideas that are

1622
07:55:56,729 --> 07:56:06,520
not connected to the robots. The robots are set in stone and we've got like two or three weeks

1623
07:56:06,520 --> 07:56:11,639
to figure out kind of the other stuff we want in there to supplement all the cool stuff to do with

1624
07:56:11,639 --> 07:56:19,819
the robots. It's not just going to be, here are a bunch of games you control with a robot. We're

1625
07:56:19,819 --> 07:56:26,279
gonna have little segments in between. There's gonna be maybe some actors that come through and

1626
07:56:26,279 --> 07:56:37,540
you know, clown around in massive gigantic fucking quotes. The whole stream will probably

1627
07:56:37,540 --> 07:56:42,020
be somewhere around like five to seven hours. It's gonna be a whole thing. It's gonna take that long

1628
07:56:42,020 --> 07:56:47,770
for you to even probably go through the games themselves. It's, this is not gonna be like a

1629
07:56:47,770 --> 07:56:53,540
30 minute stream. This is gonna be all day. It's gonna take probably four, five plus hours to go

1630
07:56:53,540 --> 07:57:09,290
through all this. What time is it gonna start? It's gonna be on eastern time, although I'm not

1631
07:57:09,290 --> 07:57:15,340
gonna be in Massachusetts like a lot of you might think. I will be on eastern time though.

1632
07:57:22,790 --> 07:57:27,939
September 21st, that's right. And besides the robot stuff, these are all just ideas that I'm

1633
07:57:27,939 --> 07:57:31,540
throwing out. Obviously none of this is set in stone besides the date and besides the robots

1634
07:57:32,419 --> 07:57:37,419
and the games that those robots are controlling. We got, remember I told you that

1635
07:57:38,060 --> 07:57:42,939
over the next, you know, I said this probably like two or three weeks ago, that I was going to dial

1636
07:57:42,939 --> 07:57:51,180
back streams to really make sure I get this rolling. I make sure I have the necessary time to

1637
07:57:51,819 --> 07:57:55,659
put into this and I can travel and go back and forth and make sure I can take care of this and

1638
07:57:55,659 --> 07:57:59,259
make it as good as I can. Like this is the reason why, because we still have to figure some of the

1639
07:57:59,259 --> 07:58:13,930
stuff out. But I will give more details when I have them, but I am going to hammer pretty much

1640
07:58:13,930 --> 07:58:30,279
every week here that the 21st is the date that you want to save if you want to be around. Should

1641
07:58:30,279 --> 07:58:43,880
be fun. And it's tough with stuff like this because even if I say this right now, tomorrow

1642
07:58:43,880 --> 07:58:47,560
a shitload of people are not even going to know that I said this. A week from now, a bunch of

1643
07:58:47,560 --> 07:58:52,599
people, it's not the same people every stream. So you're, there's always going to be somebody

1644
07:58:52,599 --> 07:58:56,840
that needs to kind of know. And I think I'm probably going to set up a command to have it

1645
07:58:56,840 --> 07:59:05,400
just be like, Carnival! Hey, September 21st! Because every day there's new people. So there'll

1646
07:59:05,400 --> 07:59:08,520
probably be a command. I'll probably play, I'll probably get like a little thing made,

1647
07:59:09,159 --> 07:59:12,520
like a 30 second promo video or something to play over the next like few weeks.

1648
07:59:17,029 --> 07:59:28,439
SusCarnival. Pin a tweet. Yeah, I'll pin a tweet too. That's a good idea. What is my pin tweet? Oh,

1649
07:59:28,439 --> 07:59:40,680
it's the t-shirts, right. But we'll move on. I just want to be clear about that because we did,

1650
07:59:40,680 --> 07:59:44,759
I talked about it a little bit at the beginning of the stream, but not to that level because we're

1651
07:59:44,759 --> 07:59:57,779
just kind of sitting here. But thank you to Appleshift for the 250. Hey man, I read somewhere

1652
07:59:57,779 --> 08:00:05,000
that your favorite band is the Gorillaz. It is. What's your favorite song of theirs? PS, my friend

1653
08:00:05,000 --> 08:00:09,720
Briar loves you, but since he lives in Australia, he can't usually watch your streams in full since

1654
08:00:09,720 --> 08:00:15,560
they're mostly while he is asleep. So I'm sending you good vibes on his behalf. Thank you for

1655
08:00:15,560 --> 08:00:23,400
everything. Yeah, time zones are really tricky. Some of us are just across the entire world

1656
08:00:24,040 --> 08:00:35,779
from each other. Australia, I think is like plus 16 hours from now from Pacific. It's like plus

1657
08:00:35,779 --> 08:00:44,389
14 or plus 16. It's something crazy. The whole day in the future. It's 5 PM right now, Australia.

1658
08:00:46,229 --> 08:00:55,189
Wow, it is almost midnight. It is 1159 PM Thursday. So you're telling me that it is 5 PM

1659
08:00:55,909 --> 08:01:05,930
Friday? Or is it 5 PM Saturday? No, 5 PM Friday. Damn, that's very, that's really insane.

1660
08:01:07,380 --> 08:01:18,310
3 PM. Jeez. And it's like 3 AM Eastern too. Time zones are fucking messed up. But my favorite song

1661
08:01:18,310 --> 08:01:27,799
from the Gorillaz is, I mean, I just like Stylo. Stylo just, I like the, I like the kick. Stylo.

1662
08:01:29,900 --> 08:01:43,779
If it wasn't Stylo, it would probably be, there's a lot. Probably, probably something from Plastic

1663
08:01:43,779 --> 08:01:52,330
Beach or Demon Days. Pick a random song out of either of those two albums. Everything else is

1664
08:01:52,330 --> 08:02:01,180
like number two. Melancholy Hill is good too. Yeah, it is. I liked a lot of the stuff in,

1665
08:02:01,819 --> 08:02:14,860
in Humans. That album was kind of hit or miss for me. But the ones that hit, I thought were really,

1666
08:02:14,860 --> 08:02:30,299
really good. Yeah, Stylo though, for sure. I don't know a lot of people that liked Humans.

1667
08:02:30,299 --> 08:02:33,259
Yeah, but that's what I mean though. Like half the tracks on Humans, I was kind of like,

1668
08:02:33,259 --> 08:02:38,919
oh, what the fuck is going on here? A lot of the tracks on Humans were just kind of like noise.

1669
08:02:39,880 --> 08:02:44,979
It was really experimental noise songs. And then the other half were like, oh, this is fucking,

1670
08:02:44,979 --> 08:03:00,310
this is awesome. This is exactly what I'm looking for. But thank you to Gnarly for the $2.50. They

1671
08:03:00,310 --> 08:03:12,389
just say donation. Thank you. Thank you for the donation. That was Gnarly. Daring Shepherd,

1672
08:03:12,389 --> 08:03:23,979
thanks for the $4. Have my paper trading goods. I will take them. Thank you. General Arse,

1673
08:03:23,979 --> 08:03:31,319
thanks for the $3. Play my level. I'm sorry I didn't do the levels from the donations.

1674
08:03:31,799 --> 08:03:37,990
Hopefully somebody played it, but I appreciate it. Thank you for the three bucks.

1675
08:03:40,520 --> 08:03:44,759
Vidis, thanks for the $10.80 is another level code. Beat it if you think you can.

1676
08:03:45,479 --> 08:03:58,569
I'm sorry I was not doing donation levels. I guess 10 bucks is a lot of money. Thank you for the

1677
08:03:58,569 --> 08:04:09,299
$10.80. People get scammed. Well, hold on though. I never said that I was taking donations for

1678
08:04:09,299 --> 08:04:30,340
levels. I never said that. I didn't say I was doing that. I said a precedent? No, I didn't.

1679
08:04:33,560 --> 08:04:39,380
I didn't take the second bribe level. There were two bribe levels and I didn't do the second one.

1680
08:04:42,310 --> 08:04:47,349
The Bala Koala gave $55 and said, hey, I heard you're taking bribes for levels and I didn't do it.

1681
08:04:48,500 --> 08:04:58,700
In fact, I didn't even say this donation on stream because I didn't see it. Sorry,

1682
08:04:58,700 --> 08:05:03,900
that's a lot of fucking money to miss during the stream. I must have been in the middle of

1683
08:05:04,459 --> 08:05:17,900
a meltdown, but that's $5500. I hate missing huge donations like this. I always feel like a dick,

1684
08:05:19,240 --> 08:05:22,200
but Bala Koala, if you're still here, that's a lot of money. Thank you so much.

1685
08:05:24,889 --> 08:05:29,369
If you make a robot that dabs when someone donates a $10 bill, that robot would never

1686
08:05:29,369 --> 08:05:36,740
stop the whole stream. I don't know. Money gets weird because I don't want to just...

1687
08:05:38,419 --> 08:05:42,099
Sure, okay. I could have a robot in the background that every time somebody donated $10,

1688
08:05:43,139 --> 08:05:50,310
the thing dabbed. I didn't even bring it up. It just was there, but I don't want to put

1689
08:05:51,270 --> 08:05:58,389
my financial obligations onto other people because I decided I was going to do this.

1690
08:06:00,580 --> 08:06:06,900
This stream is going to cost a lot of money, but you didn't tell me to do that. It wasn't like,

1691
08:06:06,900 --> 08:06:18,099
oh, jeez, Jerma. We voted. 20,000 of us voted and 19,990 of us want you to do a robot carnival

1692
08:06:18,099 --> 08:06:25,770
stream. Do it. Hey, I'm going to do this stream and it's going to cost this and this is what it's

1693
08:06:25,770 --> 08:06:31,430
going to be. Please pay for it now, everybody. You already did. I think that's something that

1694
08:06:31,430 --> 08:06:41,939
a lot of people might overlook is you already have. Where do you think I got the money to do

1695
08:06:41,939 --> 08:07:03,459
this stream? I didn't get it from my cryptocurrency investments. I'll tell you. He stole it.

1696
08:07:11,909 --> 08:07:25,430
He finally admits it. I'm just fucking kidding. Come on. He got it from gambling. Yeah, I put it

1697
08:07:25,990 --> 08:07:32,069
up. I put all my money on black and hit it once and freaked the fuck out and exhaled really hard

1698
08:07:32,069 --> 08:07:48,500
and said, holy shit, and I put it on my bank account. No, essentially to me, this stream was

1699
08:07:48,500 --> 08:07:51,939
made possible because there's a lot of people that donate and a lot of people that sub to this

1700
08:07:51,939 --> 08:08:03,689
channel, so the money that comes from that that goes into this is paid for. Now, am I a psycho

1701
08:08:03,689 --> 08:08:15,099
for doing this? Maybe. I don't know. It's very possible. Maybe one day we'll talk about

1702
08:08:15,099 --> 08:08:22,919
how much it was, but that's not a conversation for now. Enjoy it. Let's have fun and don't worry

1703
08:08:22,919 --> 08:08:42,919
about me. As part of your sub to shareholders, I demand the dabbing robot. And by the way,

1704
08:08:42,919 --> 08:08:46,599
that is like easy. If anyone wanted to like contribute or something, it could just be there,

1705
08:08:46,599 --> 08:08:53,159
but then I would want to make it something that it wasn't just me trying to delete money from like,

1706
08:08:53,159 --> 08:09:00,840
oh hey, watch the dabbing robot. It's 10 bucks. Better do it. We'll see. But let's keep going.

1707
08:09:00,840 --> 08:09:08,060
We're almost done. We had a Freudian weapon. Thanks for the 250. Thanks for playing my level

1708
08:09:08,060 --> 08:09:12,380
tonight. I knew you could do it, but I'm glad it wasn't too easy for you. Now to count down the

1709
08:09:12,380 --> 08:09:29,139
days till the carnival. Me too. I'm counting them down as well. Thank you. Acknowledge John for the

1710
08:09:29,139 --> 08:09:33,939
three bucks. Okay, I'm sorry for yelling at you when you were playing Mario, but mom said it was

1711
08:09:33,939 --> 08:09:37,779
my turn when you finished the level and I thought you were just playing bad on purpose.

1712
08:09:43,540 --> 08:09:48,099
Thank you Espadda Escalata for the 250. Jeremiah, I just want to say I enjoyed the bit where you

1713
08:09:48,099 --> 08:09:55,159
pretended to be a good gamer for once. Sometimes I turn it on. Sometimes. It's time for slime.

1714
08:09:55,159 --> 08:09:57,560
Thanks for the five dollars. Thanks for playing my level, Jeremiah Hart.

1715
08:10:01,369 --> 08:10:09,819
Do you know what I like? I'm just thinking about what I want, but it's not going to happen because

1716
08:10:09,819 --> 08:10:13,900
we've already solidified everything that was going to happen because we're getting too close.

1717
08:10:14,860 --> 08:10:19,659
I just thought one of those old Nickelodeon pie machines and just sitting like the...

1718
08:10:20,380 --> 08:10:25,659
If I say like a really bad joke and like it's not funny, then I got to go sit in like the pie pod.

1719
08:10:26,619 --> 08:10:34,139
You remember that fucking thing? Oh, the slime bucket. You know what? That might not be that

1720
08:10:34,139 --> 08:10:40,540
expensive. Having a slime bucket. Okay, I'm going to do like a secret slime action.

1721
08:10:43,459 --> 08:10:59,659
Hold on. Let me think about that. I'll get back to you. The ultimate minus two. Yeah, we'll see.

1722
08:11:01,720 --> 08:11:12,020
But thank you. Thank you to Devakitty for the 250. Jeremy, looking forward to the 21st. Me too.

1723
08:11:13,209 --> 08:11:16,889
In more recent news, however, I've been in the process of being approved for my HRT

1724
08:11:17,450 --> 08:11:21,610
for like 19 months now and hopefully the fifth is the very last of my appointments

1725
08:11:21,610 --> 08:11:27,529
and I'm stoked. Now if you'd excuse me, I'm going to go eat some of these 1.7 kilogram bag of

1726
08:11:27,529 --> 08:11:33,049
hot wings I bought for like seven dollars while enjoying my favorite bite... my favorite bite it

1727
08:11:33,049 --> 08:11:42,779
in Mario over and over again. And then did you call me Mario? Oh, in Mario. All right, I'm going

1728
08:11:42,779 --> 08:11:59,029
to do this math here. 1.7 kg is how much? What bag? How big is that bag? 1.7 kg is how many? Is it

1729
08:11:59,029 --> 08:12:08,090
how many in pounds? That's seven pounds. No, isn't one kilogram 2.2? So what, that's like three?

1730
08:12:09,590 --> 08:12:16,659
Three and a half? That's still a lot. That's a heavy bag. Seven dollars for two, three, four pounds

1731
08:12:16,659 --> 08:12:32,470
of wings? Enjoy them. I like want that now. I so badly want that right now. The time is it is too...

1732
08:12:32,470 --> 08:12:40,500
it's like late. It's like 12 o'clock. I shouldn't have jumped over the fucking stupid ass like fire

1733
08:12:40,500 --> 08:12:46,259
pole a thousand times. If I had just turned off the switch like 30 or 40 minutes before I did,

1734
08:12:47,139 --> 08:12:50,979
I would have been able to eat pizza. Great.

1735
08:13:01,180 --> 08:13:10,500
I'm now... I'm gonna... I'm gonna have to go like eat water. I'm gonna go microwave water and fucking

1736
08:13:10,500 --> 08:13:26,409
like flour. Stir it up. But thank you Devakitty. Appreciate the 250. Thank you to Manboy for the

1737
08:13:26,409 --> 08:13:30,250
250. Hey Jerm, I'm really excited for the carnival stream. I was going to attend my wife's and her

1738
08:13:30,250 --> 08:13:46,540
boyfriend's wedding on the 21st, but not anymore. Wait, wait what? It took me a second to figure that

1739
08:13:46,540 --> 08:14:03,689
out. Okay, sorry. Thank you Manboy for the 250. That's... well, I'm not sure you'd... thank you for

1740
08:14:03,689 --> 08:14:20,650
the 250. Thank you to Devakitty for the 250. Gee Willikers big stream coming up on the 21st. I was

1741
08:14:20,650 --> 08:14:25,849
going to attend the birthday of my firstborn on that day while also delivering my second child

1742
08:14:25,849 --> 08:14:30,250
and going to my grandma's 100th birthday, but there's a Jerma stream on so I won't go to any

1743
08:14:30,250 --> 08:14:33,209
of those really important events because I got to watch the silly streamer in the internet.

1744
08:14:39,500 --> 08:14:48,680
You guys can go to like your family get-togethers. Just pull up your phone and just... you pull up

1745
08:14:48,680 --> 08:14:56,150
your phone. No, don't do that. Don't do that. Don't pull up your phone. That's rude. Look, here's the

1746
08:14:56,150 --> 08:15:00,470
end-all be-all way to get out of any of this shit. No, no, not to get out of it, but you know what

1747
08:15:00,470 --> 08:15:06,470
I mean? Go, enjoy yourself, and then after like an hour or two, just say that like to hold your

1748
08:15:06,470 --> 08:15:13,029
stomach, walk up to somebody and be like, oh it's bad. I'm sorry, I've got to go now. And then like,

1749
08:15:13,029 --> 08:15:26,259
you know, bye, oh good to see you. And then leave and nobody cares. You're not the bad guy. In fact,

1750
08:15:26,259 --> 08:15:33,380
they start to think maybe they are, because why are you at my house consuming these things in my

1751
08:15:33,380 --> 08:15:39,430
house and now all of a sudden you have like a stomach diarrhea? Oh, I got to figure out how's

1752
08:15:39,430 --> 08:16:10,340
that happening. That's really bad advice. Yeah, because it was not real. Don't make it sudden,

1753
08:16:10,340 --> 08:16:15,220
though, or they might find out and get mad. No, yeah, I'm not saying do it immediately.

1754
08:16:16,419 --> 08:16:20,180
You're gonna drive up, pull into the driveway, be like, oh hey, how are you?

1755
08:16:20,180 --> 08:16:26,900
Oh, yeah, it's been what a great day it is. Oh, happy birthday. Oh, my stomach is really bothering

1756
08:16:26,900 --> 08:16:34,259
me. You know, we got to fucking get out of here. Can I use your bathroom? Or, you know, I'm just

1757
08:16:34,259 --> 08:16:39,459
gonna sit there in the middle. Okay, here we go. Oh, there's like 10 of us sitting around. Oh,

1758
08:16:39,459 --> 08:16:44,419
there's George and there's Aunt Edna. They're talking. Oh, Aunt Edna said, let me tell you

1759
08:16:44,419 --> 08:16:50,419
something about being Republican. And then George is like, oh, the Democrats, did you see? Oh,

1760
08:16:50,419 --> 08:16:54,500
my stomach and you stand up. Oh, my stomach's killing me. I'm gonna shit my... Actually,

1761
08:16:54,500 --> 08:17:03,259
it's a great way to get out of that. Take that advice. That's great advice. What perfect advice

1762
08:17:03,259 --> 08:17:19,639
that is. You can use that anywhere. You can even use that if you don't feel like getting like out

1763
08:17:19,639 --> 08:17:28,299
of bed. Hey, are you gonna like get out of bed? Oh, I wish I could, you know, get away from me,

1764
08:17:28,299 --> 08:17:37,139
my stomach, you know. Oh, you're gonna shit. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. Bye, bye, bye. Hey, the weeds are

1765
08:17:37,139 --> 08:17:42,939
getting kind of long outside. Oh, but you know, I would hate to shit on them. Yeah, you know,

1766
08:17:42,939 --> 08:17:51,720
you're right. I guess I'll do it. It's just, it's a fifth grader discovering how to lie to get out

1767
08:17:51,720 --> 08:18:03,060
of school. But the problem is, if you do that too often, then yeah. It's like going, going to the,

1768
08:18:03,060 --> 08:18:08,500
everybody, come on, everybody used to do this. You take a thermometer, right? So like mom comes

1769
08:18:08,500 --> 08:18:13,540
in, here's a thermometer. Oh, boy. Oh, I think you're sick today. Oh, yeah, I don't feel good

1770
08:18:13,540 --> 08:18:17,380
today. Well, here's the thermometer. Let's see if you got a fever. You put it in, mom leaves the

1771
08:18:17,380 --> 08:18:23,939
room. You go to the sink, the bathroom sink. You put on hot fucking water and you hold it under.

1772
08:18:23,939 --> 08:18:27,540
And you know, you're a dumb kid. You don't understand. So you sit there with burning

1773
08:18:27,540 --> 08:18:32,900
fucking hot water on it. And you end up at like 108 degrees on the thermometer. You put it back

1774
08:18:32,900 --> 08:18:39,060
in and you're like, Oh mom, something's wrong. Like, Oh, let me see, honey. Oh, you're dead.

1775
08:18:39,060 --> 08:18:43,779
You're not alive. You're actually not alive right now. Interesting. Oh, you know, you must be,

1776
08:18:43,779 --> 08:19:00,139
you can't go to school today. 107 degrees, 106 degree fever. Wow. I remember one time I put

1777
08:19:00,139 --> 08:19:06,659
orange juice in my mouth and went, my grandmother was there at the time. And I was like, Oh, here

1778
08:19:06,659 --> 08:19:10,819
we go. I'm going to be able to fool my grandmother. She's not going to be able to know that I got,

1779
08:19:10,819 --> 08:19:14,580
I'm just going to like put orange juice in my mouth. And like I lied on the ground,

1780
08:19:14,580 --> 08:19:18,659
face down. I could, I could put the orange juice in my mouth and like switched it around. So it

1781
08:19:18,659 --> 08:19:22,979
was real salivary. My grandmother was walking down the hall and I was waiting. Here she comes,

1782
08:19:23,700 --> 08:19:30,740
prone on the ground. She walked in and I was, I was putting my fist down, up and down.

1783
08:19:33,619 --> 08:19:37,220
Up and down. Like pretend I'm a child, pretend having a tantrum.

1784
08:19:38,419 --> 08:19:45,130
And just went and let it out. The orange juice. And she just looked at me. She's like, go to,

1785
08:19:45,130 --> 08:19:51,340
you're going to school. What are you doing? Like it did not even work at all. It was like,

1786
08:19:51,340 --> 08:19:55,139
she thought I was doing a joke. She was like, clean, clean that up. What are you doing?

1787
08:19:55,779 --> 08:19:59,349
Get it. You don't even have your clothes on. Get in the fucking car.

1788
08:20:00,069 --> 08:20:22,860
Clean that shit up. What is this? Oh, just kidding grandma. Kids do dumb things. But I mean,

1789
08:20:22,860 --> 08:20:27,659
that was, I think I was probably like at least I was old enough to know better. Let's put it that

1790
08:20:27,659 --> 08:20:34,810
I was like 12. You know, I was like, I was like 11 or 12. Like, come on, you're going to do like

1791
08:20:34,810 --> 08:20:47,580
the fake puke scenario. Actually, that's probably the perfect age for it. I also used to be scared

1792
08:20:47,580 --> 08:20:51,500
of the toilet. The toilet flushing sound scared me and I didn't like to go to the bathroom.

1793
08:20:51,500 --> 08:21:01,419
That has nothing to do with pretending to be sick. I don't know where that transition came from.

1794
08:21:01,419 --> 08:21:07,369
So I guess we're just kind of, I'm just letting it out, I guess. I guess we're just talking about

1795
08:21:15,450 --> 08:21:28,970
it. Anyways, let's keep going. Thank you to Kikira for the 250. They say, hey,

1796
08:21:28,970 --> 08:21:32,810
German, my boyfriend Bryce is turning 22 this week. Would you wish him a happy birthday? He

1797
08:21:32,810 --> 08:21:46,090
loves your content. Absolutely. Turn this off. Hey Bryce, heard you turning 22 this week.

1798
08:21:46,889 --> 08:21:56,650
That's a big number. You're getting there. Keep it up. Stay on track. Okay, that was,

1799
08:21:56,650 --> 08:22:00,009
hold on a minute. That was just like a, that was like a, that website where you pay a celebrity

1800
08:22:00,009 --> 08:22:05,590
to say something for 10 seconds. That was, I just did that. I just did like the celebrity,

1801
08:22:05,590 --> 08:22:14,740
was it called like Cameo? Fiverr? They knock out like 40 of those. No, no, no, no, no. We

1802
08:22:14,740 --> 08:22:18,740
ain't doing it like that. Hey Bryce, happy fucking birthday. Hope you have a good one.

1803
08:22:19,299 --> 08:22:35,049
22 this week. All right. No, now I'm like on it. Hold on. Get it off. Turn it off. Hey, hey,

1804
08:22:36,009 --> 08:22:45,750
uh, hey, Bryce, seriously, happy birthday. I'm glad you're part of this community. Hope you

1805
08:22:45,750 --> 08:22:55,180
have a great one. 22. Knock it out of the park. Thank you. Everybody here says hi. We all fucking,

1806
08:22:55,180 --> 08:22:59,419
you know, we all fucking love you over here. You're, everybody thinks you're fucking awesome.

1807
08:22:59,419 --> 08:23:09,139
All of us in the chat. Look at them. Do you see it? 22. That's a big one here. No, for real,

1808
08:23:09,139 --> 08:23:17,220
thank you so much for the 250 Kikira and a special happy birthday to Bryce. Keep, uh,

1809
08:23:22,119 --> 08:23:40,779
I'm not very good at this. Keep, keep, keep on. Yeah. All right. Now cut that up and like make it

1810
08:23:40,779 --> 08:23:49,659
sound like I'm like smart. That's not how you say his name. B-R-Y-C-E Bryce. That's not Bryce.

1811
08:23:49,659 --> 08:24:05,159
It's B-R-Y-C-E. That's correct. Yeah. Why is everybody yelling at me? Why is everybody

1812
08:24:05,159 --> 08:24:09,319
yelling at me? Or did I die on a 1% completion Mario level for the first time?

1813
08:24:12,380 --> 08:24:29,560
Wipe the sweat off the brow. Hey, you know, for those 1% completion levels,

1814
08:24:31,099 --> 08:24:46,729
there was like 4,000 people here. What is 1% of 4,000? 4. 40. So 40 of you get to say,

1815
08:24:47,610 --> 08:24:58,169
I did it and I could do it. 3,600 of the rest of you didn't do it. Happy birthday, Bryce.

1816
08:24:58,729 --> 08:25:09,979
22? Hell yeah. Jerma put sun chips in F tier thanks to the $10 and I would do it again.

1817
08:25:09,979 --> 08:25:13,740
Thank you, Jerma, for playing my level. It meant everything to me that you're able to enjoy it with

1818
08:25:13,740 --> 08:25:19,380
chat. Spamming minus two the whole time. You are honestly one of my favorite people in the world,

1819
08:25:19,380 --> 08:25:31,770
even if you have such shitty tastes. That was a very long birthday clip. Yeah.

1820
08:25:35,290 --> 08:25:42,299
Fucking comedy. But thank you for the $10. Jerma put sun chips in F tier.

1821
08:25:44,009 --> 08:25:50,740
I did. Abomination zero thanks to the $5. Please play this level. It's my birthday.

1822
08:25:51,540 --> 08:25:57,540
Hold on. Somebody's driving by really fast. Sorry, I didn't play that level. But happy birthday.

1823
08:25:58,259 --> 08:26:12,180
Is your name? What's your name? Abomination zero. Happy birthday. What are sun chips?

1824
08:26:16,069 --> 08:26:22,139
There's this weird like wavy, really grainy wheat kind of tasting, dusted with,

1825
08:26:22,939 --> 08:26:30,099
they're like crispy, but they're not. They're like cardboard crispy. They don't, after like you eat

1826
08:26:30,099 --> 08:26:39,000
three of them, you don't taste it anymore. Okay, I mean, I don't, I would eat them maybe. Okay,

1827
08:26:39,000 --> 08:26:46,650
let's put it this way. If a stewardess or, okay, like a flight attendant, right? Walk down the

1828
08:26:46,650 --> 08:26:52,139
aisle with a bag of sun chips and that's all that was left? Oh, where are the Cheez-Its? We don't

1829
08:26:52,139 --> 08:26:58,619
have any. Where are the pretzels? I'm sorry, we're out of those too. Where are the, what else you got

1830
08:26:58,619 --> 08:27:06,779
in there? What are those? Peanuts? No, we don't have those. Oh, you got sun chips. Okay, I guess

1831
08:27:06,779 --> 08:27:21,500
I'll have a pineapple juice. Wouldn't even need it on a plane. Hey, InvaderZ, thanks for the three

1832
08:27:21,500 --> 08:27:31,450
dollars. Hey, dude, my sister and I got two XL rats today and I wanted to name mine Jeremy,

1833
08:27:31,450 --> 08:27:38,599
but she wouldn't let me. Probably for the best. Anyway, I'm excited to be a rat dad. Love watching

1834
08:27:38,599 --> 08:28:01,689
your streams. Hey, can I name him Jeremy? No. All right. Music's muted. Oh, fuck. Congratulations

1835
08:28:01,689 --> 08:28:08,389
on the rats. They are intelligent. They're fun. They're cuddly. They're passionate. They're

1836
08:28:09,770 --> 08:28:21,139
empathetic. They're, they're very fast. They're very agile. Take it from somebody that has never

1837
08:28:21,220 --> 08:28:34,119
owned one but sees cute videos of them all the time. I'm informed. But thank you. Good luck.

1838
08:28:34,119 --> 08:28:39,750
That sounds awesome. Hey, Weskerun, thanks for the five dollars. Cheers, Jeremy, long time fan. First

1839
08:28:39,750 --> 08:28:46,619
time on stream. What up? They also subbed right before that too, so that's, that's a double.

1840
08:28:46,619 --> 08:29:03,880
Thank you. Thank you, Weskerun, and welcome to the stream. First time on the stream. Thank you,

1841
08:29:03,880 --> 08:29:13,349
Elizabeth, for the three, four, five, six, seven, eight, eight dollars. Thank you for the eight

1842
08:29:13,349 --> 08:29:17,029
dollars. Uh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that is not, that is incorrect.

1843
08:29:19,459 --> 08:29:27,340
Elizabeth gave three dollars and then Errolus gave five dollars. It was Elizabeth and then Errolus.

1844
08:29:28,360 --> 08:29:32,119
So Elizabeth, thanks with three bucks. Am I ever going to go back to play more Dreams or did you

1845
08:29:32,119 --> 08:29:41,240
forget about that game? Uh, I actually just got, uh, sad because I wanted to use the move controllers

1846
08:29:42,040 --> 08:29:48,040
and I realized that I gave my PSVR away, which included the PS camera. So I have the move

1847
08:29:48,040 --> 08:29:52,520
controllers here and I was getting it set up and I go, ah, the camera's not here. I gave it away.

1848
08:29:53,639 --> 08:30:02,459
And then that, for some reason, was the wall, me not getting a new PS camera because I really wanted

1849
08:30:02,459 --> 08:30:19,099
to learn how to sculpt with the move controllers. But when does that game actually release? It was

1850
08:30:19,099 --> 08:30:23,900
in like creator access, right? A creator early access, early access. Is it just there still?

1851
08:30:24,619 --> 08:30:32,919
There was a really interesting game, but it was kind of complicated. It was not complicated in

1852
08:30:32,919 --> 08:30:38,360
a sense of creating things, but it takes a lot of time to be able to get anything done,

1853
08:30:39,159 --> 08:30:47,900
which I really don't have. I wish I had the time to dedicate like two or three weeks straight to

1854
08:30:47,900 --> 08:30:55,639
learning how to do that game very well, but I just don't. I just can't. It's a really cool game,

1855
08:30:55,639 --> 08:31:12,220
though. But thank you Errolus for the five dollars. Are my file names like filename01.file?

1856
08:31:13,020 --> 08:31:18,840
How do you format your file names? Well, I can tell you right now. Let's see. Let's just look

1857
08:31:18,840 --> 08:31:23,400
and go into like a folder and like some files that I recently named. Let's see what they say.

1858
08:31:24,360 --> 08:31:33,319
Oh, I gotta go through here. I do one of two things. I either just write the first word that

1859
08:31:33,319 --> 08:31:47,020
the thing is. Okay, so I have in this folder, I got the old emote. So this is just the title.

1860
08:31:47,020 --> 08:32:01,419
This is just old face, old face final. Old is also let's go into this one. Okay, let's see.

1861
08:32:03,959 --> 08:32:25,720
Setup. All right. A2. I don't know what any of these are. 08? No, these are like I don't even

1862
08:32:25,720 --> 08:32:29,639
have any like files anymore. I used to have so many more. What is this? What the fuck is this?

1863
08:32:30,360 --> 08:32:37,900
Oh, this is the the highlights. Let's read this. Tell me if you think this is funny.

1864
08:32:38,700 --> 08:32:42,819
I wrote down. Okay, so I remember the highlight stream thing that I wanted to do with the

1865
08:32:42,900 --> 08:32:50,860
highlights magazine. We got five to six pages of dot to dots. Five pages of Whales Where's Waldo.

1866
08:32:51,900 --> 08:32:55,340
Two to three hidden object pages. Two to three coloring pages. A joke section.

1867
08:32:57,770 --> 08:33:06,650
User submitted stories. Ads. What is ads here for? Two to three pages of ads. Was I making

1868
08:33:06,650 --> 08:33:20,250
a joke to myself later on that I would read later? That's weird. Gotta have ads apparently.

1869
08:33:20,889 --> 08:33:24,970
I don't know. I usually just write the first word. If it's a picture, I just say like, oh, it's a

1870
08:33:26,250 --> 08:33:32,889
let's say it's a picture of a dog like dog one. Oh, no, no, it's a this. It's a water slide slide.

1871
08:33:33,450 --> 08:33:38,650
I just and then they kind of use something to do slide and you write slide again and then it's

1872
08:33:38,650 --> 08:33:59,270
slide in parentheses two or slide parentheses one. But let's get the credits on here. Thanks for

1873
08:33:59,270 --> 08:34:09,159
watching guys. See you tomorrow. We will figure something out as we typically do. Here come all

1874
08:34:09,159 --> 08:34:22,819
of the subs. Thank you everybody. And there were a shitload of them. Resubs, community subs, gifted

1875
08:34:22,819 --> 08:34:37,529
subs, new subs, all of you. It's going by real fast. Yeah, good night everybody. We'll see you

1876
08:34:37,529 --> 08:34:48,299
tomorrow. There's still a couple bits left to do. We got future gamer thanks to 250. Did you hear

1877
08:34:48,299 --> 08:34:53,419
about the grasshopper pizza in retaliation to the Vegas invasion? Also, have you had any run ins

1878
08:34:53,419 --> 08:35:00,919
with the grasshoppers? They're everywhere. And for some weird reason, if you don't know, Las Vegas has

1879
08:35:00,919 --> 08:35:09,349
seen because we had such a wet spring. We had a lot of water here this past spring. So they were

1880
08:35:09,349 --> 08:35:14,150
able, I guess, to stop here or breed here or whatever the hell. I have no idea. But there's

1881
08:35:14,790 --> 08:35:22,150
millions everywhere. They're everywhere in every corner in every fucking place. Grasshoppers.

1882
08:35:22,150 --> 08:35:27,509
And for some weird reason, I don't know why they're like this. They're not scary. They don't bite.

1883
08:35:28,069 --> 08:35:38,630
They don't sting. They don't do anything bad. But they try to just fly into your face. I don't know

1884
08:35:38,630 --> 08:35:43,430
why. You'll open a door to leave somewhere and there'll be a couple that just jump right into

1885
08:35:43,990 --> 08:35:52,229
trying to get in your mouth. I don't know why they do that. You want to see something crazy?

1886
08:35:52,229 --> 08:35:57,750
You want to see some biblical crazy like conspiracy theory end of the world shit?

1887
08:35:59,110 --> 08:36:06,009
Go look up the picture of all the grasshoppers swarming the light at the Luxor.

1888
08:36:06,009 --> 08:36:13,130
Las Vegas has this big casino pyramid called the Luxor. It's a huge pyramid with a gigantic light

1889
08:36:13,130 --> 08:36:25,110
on top that beams into the stratosphere. You can see it from space. So already, like, wait,

1890
08:36:25,110 --> 08:36:29,270
why is there a pyramid with a giant light shooting at the sky? And now you've got grasshoppers

1891
08:36:29,909 --> 08:36:37,099
flying around it and inside of it. So you've got the pyramid light to the sky and the biblical,

1892
08:36:37,979 --> 08:36:46,330
I don't know what's going to happen. Biblical fucking grasshoppers, locusts in that pyramid.

1893
08:36:46,330 --> 08:37:03,979
Somebody's got it right here. Yeah. Look at that shit. That's nightmare fuel. Yeah, it is.

1894
08:37:04,860 --> 08:37:10,740
But it's been a lot but it's been okay. The last couple of days you see them still jumping around

1895
08:37:10,740 --> 08:37:24,310
but not like it was last week. But you know, whatever. I'll take grasshoppers. Yeah, you know,

1896
08:37:24,310 --> 08:37:31,029
I used to live in Massachusetts. I'll take plague biblical grasshoppers over one afternoon

1897
08:37:31,830 --> 08:37:44,310
around mosquitoes. Ever again. Just saying. But we have a couple more. We got an error list for

1898
08:37:44,310 --> 08:37:48,150
250 in all seriousness. Looking forward to September 21st and appreciate how much work

1899
08:37:48,150 --> 08:38:00,229
you put into all this. Hopefully it's worth it. I think it will be. Time will tell. It should be fun.

1900
08:38:03,580 --> 08:38:07,419
Wyrand thanks for the 250. Hey Jerma, I'm pretty involved in the community of the game called

1901
08:38:07,419 --> 08:38:13,659
Osu! and a little while ago a player mapped your song into the game and now it's a classic

1902
08:38:14,299 --> 08:38:17,900
in that scene and introduced a lot of people to you. Just thought it would be cool to tell

1903
08:38:17,900 --> 08:38:24,250
you if you haven't seen it. Is this the the rat song? I think we have seen this. Is this the rats?

1904
08:38:25,049 --> 08:38:44,490
We've yeah we've seen this one before. Yep. Wow, this is so cool. Yeah, I remember watching this

1905
08:38:45,209 --> 08:38:59,340
really late. I kind of want to play Osu! again. I've never played it. I don't know. I feel like

1906
08:38:59,340 --> 08:39:03,740
I would be kind of good at that game because if there's one thing that I know how to do well,

1907
08:39:03,740 --> 08:39:13,419
I have really good reaction speed. I do. I might not have very much of anything else,

1908
08:39:13,419 --> 08:39:26,889
but I know that I have really good like reaction times for stuff like that. Yeah, isn't it like a

1909
08:39:26,889 --> 08:39:41,700
Lycan game? Isn't Osu! essentially a Lycan rhythm game with your mouse? But here, I'll show it.

1910
08:39:41,700 --> 08:39:55,689
We'll skim through it. The rats song. Bring your own phone. Well, your own real phone

1911
08:39:55,689 --> 08:40:05,880
when you switch to Google Fi. Don't buy that. Don't buy that. Yeah, see it's like you got like

1912
08:40:05,880 --> 08:40:15,189
the mouse. I feel like I would be all right at this if I memorized it. I mean maybe not this good.

1913
08:40:15,830 --> 08:40:39,939
He's using a tablet. Holy shit. That's next level. Have they missed one time? Oh my god.

1914
08:40:40,659 --> 08:41:00,340
That's mesmerizing. Don't you feel like some of these people should go into surgery?

1915
08:41:00,979 --> 08:41:16,139
You know what I mean? Like that's like surgeon level of precision. If I was getting like an

1916
08:41:16,139 --> 08:41:26,150
operation and I got to pick one person that wasn't a doctor and had no medical background

1917
08:41:26,150 --> 08:41:47,529
to perform my surgery, I'd be like, can you get that Osu! guy down here?

1918
08:41:47,529 --> 08:41:52,409
There have been studies that non-gamer surgeons are much better at Super Monkey Ball than

1919
08:41:53,130 --> 08:42:12,500
other non-gamers. What? Did I read that wrong? No, I didn't. Did I? They don't have precision.

1920
08:42:12,500 --> 08:42:19,610
They have memory. Yeah, okay. So just let's say I was getting like a gallstone removed.

1921
08:42:20,790 --> 08:42:28,970
Make a song that was just the gallstone surgery and just tell them to do it. Give them the song.

1922
08:42:28,970 --> 08:42:32,250
Have them memorize it and do it really well. And it's just called gallstones.

1923
08:42:34,279 --> 08:42:38,919
And then I'll lie down on my back and you could just put the fucking gas on my mouth and

1924
08:42:38,919 --> 08:42:43,639
I'll then just play the song and let him do it. Just put a scalpel in his hand this time.

1925
08:42:44,360 --> 08:43:00,860
I'm of the belief that you got to be a little insane to want to be a surgeon and like cut

1926
08:43:00,860 --> 08:43:16,099
inside people. Surgeons love Super Monkey Ball. Why Super Monkey Ball? I don't understand.

1927
08:43:16,979 --> 08:43:24,599
I kind of think it's about the money. Yeah, I mean a good surgeon can make...

1928
08:43:24,599 --> 08:43:31,159
Well, I mean a good surgeon definitely can't make as much as a Minecraft YouTuber. So

1929
08:43:31,959 --> 08:43:49,080
just wait till all these surgeons figure out they can just play Minecraft.

1930
08:43:49,639 --> 08:44:08,569
How is he not open the link? I don't click links. Links freak me out.

1931
08:44:09,529 --> 08:44:15,959
Doctors put scalpel down for video game controllers. This is... What is this video?

1932
08:44:30,540 --> 08:44:34,939
And so that brought me to do three years of research on video games and how they

1933
08:44:34,939 --> 08:44:42,520
impact laparoscopic surgery. And that's what brought us here today. That video games can

1934
08:44:42,520 --> 08:44:54,459
help you be more efficient and also suppress errors in surgery. I can't handle this right now.

1935
08:44:58,169 --> 08:45:02,090
I can't handle this. I can't. It's too late. It's been nine hours. I gotta go to bed.

1936
08:45:02,889 --> 08:45:07,849
I can't watch surgeons play Super Monkey Ball right now. To me that's like going over the edge.

1937
08:45:08,650 --> 08:45:18,860
Am I going to Evo? I am might... I might be there on Sunday. I might show up on Sunday and just

1938
08:45:18,860 --> 08:45:30,470
kind of walk around with locusts. But thank you. Final bit from Stuff from Thing. Thanks for five

1939
08:45:30,470 --> 08:45:35,430
dollars. They say, Jeremy, I made this a few days ago and I wanted you to see... I wanted you to see

1940
08:45:35,430 --> 08:45:45,450
it. Love what you do. Oh, I did see this. This the fireman gift. It's really cute with the stretchy

1941
08:45:45,450 --> 08:45:53,819
legs. If I see you there can I have an autograph? No, I'm gonna be there in disguise. I'm gonna

1942
08:45:53,819 --> 08:45:58,060
have like the glasses and the mustache and just like with like a... I'm just gonna sit like in the

1943
08:45:58,060 --> 08:46:16,409
back with like a fucking hat on and like a mustache and shit. Let's play a look. All right. You want

1944
08:46:16,409 --> 08:46:23,400
to see? Look for the guy with the mustache. That's what I just told you but now it's a beard. Where

1945
08:46:23,400 --> 08:46:31,740
is he? I know Jeremy's wearing like a fake mustache. And now I'm gonna be like in a Master Chief

1946
08:46:31,740 --> 08:46:42,099
costume. Good luck. He's gonna be in a Master Chief costume. Spread that around. And now I'm

1947
08:46:42,180 --> 08:46:54,580
gonna be like dressed as like a night elf from Warcraft. Good luck. Five foot Master Chief.

1948
08:46:55,220 --> 08:47:03,139
You don't know how tall Master... Yeah, I'm sorry. There's a biography for Master Chief and it tells

1949
08:47:03,139 --> 08:47:24,759
his height. He's six feet tall. Whatever. He's not that tall. Master Chief is six feet tall.

1950
08:47:25,319 --> 08:47:39,259
That's not that huge for your huge super Master Chief guy. But that's it. I'll see you tomorrow.

1951
08:47:39,819 --> 08:47:45,909
Kind of a long one tonight but you know I've been gone for a while. So I'll see you guys tomorrow.

1952
08:47:45,909 --> 08:47:51,779
Same time, same place. Take care guys. Have a good one.
