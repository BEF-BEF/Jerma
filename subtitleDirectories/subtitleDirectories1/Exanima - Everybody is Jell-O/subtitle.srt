1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,089
Alright, let's take a look here. I can swing left. I can swing right. I can swing down.

2
00:00:16,089 --> 00:00:27,559
Can I swing up? Not really, but this is extremely awkward.

3
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:36,810
What is my guy doing right now? Who is winning this fight? Did he just knock it out of my

4
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:47,420
hand? Can I get a stick? Oh, a stick! Give me the stick. Give me the stick. Give me the

5
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:57,159
stick. Have I been up and spotted? These guys aren't hostile. Oh, okay, cool. These guys

6
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:05,849
are not hostile. Excellent. Now they are. Should I run from this? I feel like I need

7
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:17,010
to run and not like... Alright, let's do it. I'm almost dead. I'm dead again. Holy shit.

8
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:23,819
Just be on your way, game. I can't die here. If I die here, I'm going to be extremely upset

9
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:30,409
considering... Do I attack this guy? I kind of have to. He's looking at me weird. I gotta

10
00:01:31,209 --> 00:01:45,079
Here he comes. Come on. Come on. I missed. I missed and I'm going to die for it. Damn

11
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:56,299
it! I don't know what I did. I did something wrong. I feel like I'm a little kid in a Halloween

12
00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:02,189
costume his mother made for him. Oh, sure, honey. You're a Power Ranger. Yeah, you are.

13
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:18,699
I promise. You're not a box. Did the other kids make fun of you? Keep moving. Keep going.

14
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,699
This might be a bad time, but can you give me some directions out of here? I'm kind of

15
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:31,379
lost and I can't see because there's a box on my head, but if you can lead me out... Ow, my hand.

16
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:48,979
I don't even think he can hurt me. He can't hit me. You have never seen my impenetrable box fought

17
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:57,780
like this before. I'm going to sit here until this guy hurts me. Oh, he's getting through.

18
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:12,780
I wonder, can I swing back? See if I can fight back. I don't think so. I can't fight back.

19
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,650
Oh, wait, he's getting around. Hey, cut it out.

20
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:37,849
Go run. Run. Stop running into walls, please. And just escape. Escape this horrible castle.

21
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:51,610
Get away from me, you cretin. No. I am going to club this guy. Just wait till this guy makes

22
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:58,139
his way around this corner. I'm going to smash this guy's skull and he's going to wish he was

23
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:03,500
never born. So let's just pretend like we don't want to hurt this guy and he's going to keep

24
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:13,460
walking. No, he's not. Here we go. You want to see how I do things? Oh, my God. I can't even do it.

25
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:21,060
I'm already dead. I wanted to sledgehammer the guy and the guy was holding it like a

26
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,819
pool cue for a second and he didn't even reach back. I'm trying to do like the swing with the

27
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:33,079
physics. I forgot to put clothes on before I came into the arena. I've got like a big diaper on.

28
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:46,629
Oh, come on. Get away from the wall. Get away from the wall. All right. Go back right. Nice.

29
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:59,290
Nice. Okay. I'm just turning into the Star Wars kid at this point. That old like internet video.

30
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:19,990
I won. What the hell? I haven't beaten this guy. I have not beaten this guy. This guy's got the

31
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:33,379
shield. Shit. My face got stuck in his shield. That's horse shit. Whoa. Oh, come on. What the

32
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:44,149
fuck was that? Protect yourself. Damn it. Oh, this game is so hard.
