00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:06,070
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, but

2
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:12,570
this is not going to really be a commentary on the gameplay. I'll tell you what the game is though.

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,609
It's an engineer gameplay with the Frontier Justice and the Mini-Sentry with the pistol,

4
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:23,609
and it's a one-life gameplay, the best one-life gameplay I've ever recorded. It's also going to

5
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,969
be on Turbine, CTF Turbine. Capture the Flag, this is like the first Capture the Flag gameplay I've

6
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:36,219
ever had. But the reason why I made this video is, if you can tell by the title, this is my 100th

7
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:41,899
upload to YouTube. Kind of a monumental thing for me. It's a big deal in general, 100 uploads,

8
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:47,740
that's a lot of uploads. I know a lot of guys that have like a thousand uploads, but obviously

9
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:53,500
they had their 100 upload at some point as well. And mine, this is going to be kind of a personal,

10
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,780
very personal video, not only to thank the people that watch and support this channel,

11
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:07,299
but it's going to be a history of how I got here and why you should absolutely never give up on

12
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:14,379
something because you have no idea what's actually going to happen. So let me rewind for a minute or

13
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:19,819
two here and let's go back to, at least in my case, I graduated college with a bachelor's in

14
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:25,829
communications. I went to school for five years, I was on the five-year plan. I was kind of a slacker

15
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:31,430
in college, not really a slacker. I just, I've had this problem with authority my whole life,

16
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:36,069
not like police, not like, oh, I broke the law a lot of times. I've just had this problem with

17
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:41,109
doing work when I'm supposed to and getting things done on time. I've had a problem with that my whole

18
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:46,060
life. That video, I could talk about that for six years, but that's for another day.

19
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:57,400
So I graduated college in 09, I got back and I did absolutely nothing. I was one of those people

20
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,920
that, oh, I'm going to be a director, I want to be an editor, I want to be a filmmaker,

21
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,480
and I never did anything about it. I didn't do anything. The only thing I ever did is I did

22
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:11,879
wedding videos, I did freelance music videos and stuff like that, but I never really pushed for

23
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:18,680
anything. So fast forward a couple of years, it is now 2011, almost 2012 I know, but as of recording

24
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:25,500
this video, it is 2011 and I decided to make a YouTube channel. I had a YouTube channel before

25
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,780
this, but that was for just random stupid stuff, random little skits and stuff like that. Nothing

26
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,740
really important, nothing I really wanted to push for, but this channel, this German 985 channel,

27
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:41,430
is only about six, six and a half months old. In June of this past year, I made this channel

28
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,509
because I looked around, I watched, I was a big gaming guy anyways, I watched all these gaming

29
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:50,469
channels and I said, you know, I want to try that. I just wanted to see if I could do it.

30
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:54,870
That was the number one reason why I did this channel to begin with. I wanted to see if I could

31
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,830
even do it. If I had the equipment, if I had the capabilities, if I could actually talk for a few

32
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:04,860
minutes in a row without freaking out. So I made two videos, they're still on this channel, it's

33
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:11,319
the spy and the medic one. I made those in the same day and I uploaded them and after probably

34
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:17,960
three or four hours, I took them down and I deleted the channel. Because in my opinion, I said,

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,879
I'm 26 years old, why am I doing this? This is, this is like a waste of my time. I'm too old to

36
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:27,800
be doing this. I need to figure something else out. I got to do something. I can't spend my time

37
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:33,370
on this. I can't do it. I cannot do it. So a couple of days go by and I sat on it for a little while.

38
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:38,250
I said, okay, I'm not bringing it back. No reason to. It's just, I can't do it. Like I said before,

39
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,620
I cannot do it. I talked to a friend of mine and this is what I'm going to relay to you guys.

40
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:49,060
Because if I did not talk to this friend about this certain problem, this certain little issue,

41
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,699
this channel would not exist. This channel would never have existed and it's one of the

42
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:59,460
reasons why I made this video for my 100 uploads because I brought the channel back after talking

43
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:05,860
to a friend of mine because he told me, he said, look, if you're going to go for something,

44
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:11,060
you have to go for it. And that's something that really rang in my head because he's true.

45
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:17,399
What he said was true. If you want to do something, you have to do it. You can't just put like 5%

46
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,000
effort into it and say, you know, I'm whatever. I don't care. If you want to take something

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,360
seriously, you have to just go for it. You have to do it. And that was my problem for so long.

48
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:33,480
I never put effort into anything. I just did it to do it or I just talked about it or I just

49
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,560
told people about certain things that I wanted to do. I never really went for it. I never did it.

50
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,579
And now when you fast forward, after I reactivated, I put a lot of effort into it,

51
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:47,699
really tried to go as hard as I could at it. I'm a machinima director. I have 10,000 subscribers,

52
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:53,939
which is unbelievable to me. It's unbelievable, guys. It's really ridiculous. I can't even

53
00:04:53,939 --> 00:05:00,439
imagine that there's 10,000 people that have wanted to listen to what I had to say. And every

54
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:08,300
day, every day I say this is unbelievable. And I appreciate and respect every single one of you.

55
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:14,300
And that's why I made this video because this is the 10,000 subscriber 100 upload video. I wanted

56
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,540
to give you guys a personal story. And what I have to say to you guys, if you ever want to

57
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,319
do anything, if you ever want to start anything, you want to get into something, whether that be

58
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:30,920
sports, whether that be YouTube, whether that be drama, music, go for it. Don't sit around like I

59
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:37,879
did for years contemplating what to do, how to start something. Just start it and really,

60
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:43,449
really go for it. So that's kind of the message of this video. Sorry if I rambled a little bit,

61
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:47,850
but I wanted this video to be at least special to the people that have followed this channel for

62
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:54,089
a while and even the new people. It's just an insight into, I guess, my life and where I've

63
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:59,370
come. I don't typically do videos like this, but every once in a while I will to give you guys a

64
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:05,370
little insight on at least my life and how I go about things and how I did things. And not a whole

65
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,689
lot of people knew about the whole channel deletion thing. And I wanted to get that out there because

66
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:15,860
it's been a hundred uploads now and I thank you guys every day for that and that's crazy.

67
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,459
But I'll get into the gameplay now. There's maybe another minute and a half. I just want to talk

68
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:24,870
about this one live gameplay and what actually is happening right now. So if you see where I keep

69
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:30,149
placing that sentry, this is on Turbine. Turbine is a unbelievable place to play Combat Engineer.

70
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:35,189
If you want to play Combat Engie, do it on Turbine because that little spot right back here,

71
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:39,430
that's a spy obviously, but right back here behind everybody, see I have my dispenser right

72
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:44,069
there, but right to the right. That is the best place for a mini sentry because there's only one

73
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:49,509
place they can come out. They can only come out of these two doors or up top. So your mini sentry is

74
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:54,170
guaranteed to shoot at somebody. And once that happens, you're pretty much going to get an

75
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:59,129
assist. At least once every couple minutes you'll get one assist, at least. So you can kind of just

76
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:04,089
hang out outside the door after you destroy the sentry and wait for some dude to come out and

77
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:09,189
then plow him in the face with a shotgun shot. Another great place for a mini sentry is right

78
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:14,069
where I just put it, right behind those big warehouse storage box things. Because what

79
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:17,430
that does, that allows you to hide it for long enough because someone's going to come out there

80
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:22,970
and not see a mini sentry, walk right by it and all of a sudden and they're going to be like,

81
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:28,329
oh my god, which is going to get you a kill or an assist. So that's going to be the end of this

82
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:32,250
gameplay. I come around the corner and I get myself killed by a pyro, but this is like one

83
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,500
of the best one live gameplays I ever recorded. So I wanted to make sure I got it out there.

84
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,740
Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. And thank you so much for

85
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:47,139
10,000 subscribers, guys. It's awesome. 100 uploads, let's shoot for 10 million uploads,

86
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:52,730
right? I will see you guys all next time and take care, everybody.
