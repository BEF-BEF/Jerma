1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,199
Oh my god, what just- hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2.

2
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:18,640
I'm so confused right now. What the hell just even happened right there?

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:25,859
I just shot a spy and he like flipped backwards into a bunch of stuff and like broke all- that was as if I threw him

4
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,440
Into a table. What the hell was that? But yeah, Facecam Fortress 2 Mondays edition. How you guys all doing?

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:39,039
How you guys having a fantastic Monday? And they're gonna get that first point. No! Zeppelin, you gotta stop him.

6
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,679
Me and Zeppelin are gonna drop a friggin' Zeppelin on their heads. Oh

7
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:55,759
No, don't disconnect, please. Please don't disconnect. Please Zeppelin. Here we go. Headshot! Yeah!

8
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:03,429
That's what I like to say. This soldier is a headshot. If I'd waited another second, I wouldn't have had him.

9
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:10,159
Whoa, that was a little bit of laggy lag right there. Not too keen on that.

10
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:16,680
Disp- I think people are just disconnecting left and right here. Hey, I'll use it to my advantage.

11
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:23,650
Oh, that's three in a row. I call that a three in a row. Welcome to hell!

12
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:33,280
I'm actually doing pretty- pretty well right now. Question is, can you keep it going? It's the age-old question right there.

13
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:45,010
That's another headshot. Gotta get that guy. Get him off that point. Get him offa. Damn. Whoa, whoa, whoa. No!

14
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:53,180
That was a pretty good run though. I killed like five or six people. I think they are going to get it, unfortunately.

15
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:00,750
Unfortunately, no. Two soldiers. Oh well. What can you do, right?

16
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:09,550
So today, my drink of choice is a delicious iced tea. Not just any iced tea, it's the pure leaf stuff.

17
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:17,509
If you never had pure leaf, it is probably the best iced tea you could ever drink. And he had to move. He had to move, didn't he?

18
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:26,189
You are stuck in there, my friend. Should have hit him with that. Oh, he's still alive. Oh, and there's a-

19
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:36,750
No, I'm kind of- I'm going to eat a pretzel. I got- Oh, by the way, do you guys reme- Speaking of stuff that I drink and eat and stuff like that,

20
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:42,840
Who remembers these things? Do you remember these things? The pretzels in the box?

21
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,150
I remember when I was like five or six years old, I used to eat these every day. Oh my god. Oh my god.

22
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,719
They're gonna win. Notify if I have anything to say about it. Oh,

23
00:02:53,439 --> 00:03:05,120
chaos. It's just absolute chaos. Oh, I figured I could have done something about that. By the way, these are so stale.

24
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,280
I just- I just bit into a piece of white bread. Forget that. Let's go again. Come on.

25
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,430
I was- I was on a roll there and I got too busy talking about pretzels and iced tea.

26
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:17,840
But I didn't do

27
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:24,539
shoot. Time to time travel. If you remember what time traveling is,

28
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:32,560
it's when I go like this and we appear at the setup is over. Time travel. The best kind of travel.

29
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,860
So let's kill that guy up top or just totally miss him. Either one of those two things

30
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:45,370
I'm happy with, for sure. Walk into it. That sniper right there. Is he gonna have a bad day? Oh, what?

31
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:56,099
I would have headshot him. Oh, things are not looking good right in the beginning here, folks. I knew it.

32
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:03,580
I could see through all the way down into- look at- my arrow is in his scope. That's ridiculous.

33
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,379
My arrow was through his scope. Shouldn't that have hit him? Actually, no, it's through the barrel.

34
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:13,460
So technically that's like an eye or like a- no, that's not- that wouldn't be an eye shot.

35
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:19,060
What the HE double honky stick am I talking about? Should have hit him. Should have hit him.

36
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:25,439
Oh, I'm doing all kinds of missing here tonight right here. Not on that guy. I- I

37
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,519
Interpreted his movements. I need health though, is that medic? Medic!

38
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:46,839
Medic! Medic! Medic! Medic! No! You! I'll take you on now. I'll take you on now!

39
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:49,490
Let's go! Let's go, man!

40
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:57,100
Oh, give him the old chop chop spike. Oh, I just freaked out. I stole that guy's health so bad.

41
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:11,629
I'll get him this time right here. Right through the trees like a real sniper. Oh, yeah, there it is! There it is!

42
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:21,800
Gotta be careful here. Smart. Smart demo man. You are smart. What is your name? What is that guy's name?

43
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:27,100
Oh my god, that is not a

44
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,290
PG name.

45
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:41,399
The best part about Steam is the fact that you can just make your name something just absolutely ludicrous and that's- Spy,

46
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:45,689
what are you doing, man? Is he still alive? I don't know.

47
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:49,620
I would only think you'd do that if you had a dead ringer. Crap!

48
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:55,089
Oh, no! At least he got it. At least one of us is not going to burn to death.

49
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:02,920
Give him the old chop chop. It's the same guy. It's the same like really nice guy.

50
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:08,709
I love how it was that guy and

51
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:20,600
chicken. That killed me. Oh, this guy like xx like- and chicken. Gotta love chicken. Did not mean to click, by the way.

52
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:27,600
That was a misclick. Let's go! At least I killed him. At least I killed-

53
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:32,550
Oh, I gotta- I gotta like relax a little bit here. I'm being a little too crazy.

54
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,290
I gotta get- I gotta step back a little bit. Take a breather.

55
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:45,620
Okay, now it's time to bring the headshots back. Time to bring it back to headshot, Phil. And if not,

56
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:59,160
then you know what? What can you do? Headshot. Where- where are these-

57
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:05,560
That guy just came out of nowhere. Oh, this is bad. They're pushing us all the way back.

58
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:08,740
This is really bad. It started off really good, too.

59
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:26,660
Let's go. Me and sellon88. Damn, this is not good. Come on now. That's a spy right there.

60
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:42,120
That is not a spy. I'm so paranoid right now. Where's this other guy? No, I hit him right in

61
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:51,120
the back of the head with the stupid thing. Walk into it. We got a cactus. Get on the point here,

62
00:07:51,120 --> 00:08:02,000
fellas. Spy? No. Keep it going here. Keep it going here. Even if I die, you will remember me.

63
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:13,879
Nice, nice. Oh, dude. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, Heavy. I didn't realize he had that little health.

64
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:24,449
He had like no health. I have to say sorry. And then sad face. Heavy, I'm sorry. I took that health.

65
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,709
We're gonna get it, though. Oh, by the way, speaking of just weird things, I have a hat on

66
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:37,490
today. It is a backwards baker boy. I think I've had this hat on before in previous videos.

67
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:48,960
The vintage baker boy. That's a miss. That's a miss as well. That's- oh man, he got me with such

68
00:08:48,960 --> 00:09:04,210
a crazy meat shot right there. Health so bad. I'm gonna die. Oh, get lit. I might have to change

69
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,370
here. We might see a change. Huntsman ain't really working so well at this moment in time and

70
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:28,259
history. We got the point, at least. That's a good thing. Get him with that G-Rawdy. That sniper's

71
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:37,590
gunning for me. Good. If I can keep that sniper preoccupied, I'm happy. Oh, man. Nice shot. All

72
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:43,490
right, it's time to change. We gotta change to- we gotta go medic. We need one so bad. All right,

73
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:50,690
let's go, fellas. Let's do a super push here. Except I don't want to get myself killed, so don't

74
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,899
go too far away from me or else you're not gonna get healed. No, don't go down. Actually, yeah,

75
00:09:54,899 --> 00:10:02,080
go down. Go down. That was a big mistake. Big mistake on my part. I should not have gone anywhere.

76
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:14,399
Are we gonna cap it? Are we gonna win? Oh, get on it. Yes. Oh, we did it. Hooray. Nice job, guys.

77
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:21,029
Good game all around. That's gonna wrap it up here for Face Game Fortress 2, Monday's edition.

78
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:25,799
Thank you guys so much for watching. Really do appreciate it. And I will see you guys all next

79
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:32,129
time. Clink. Mm. Take care, everybody.
