1
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:41,609
How you doing? Doesn't this guy eat gravel? No. I don't. I don't recommend it either.

2
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:53,289
Dude, can you perform circus tricks on stream? If you do, I'll cash app you 50 cents.

3
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:07,400
You don't have to. You don't have to cash app. I'm not doing it. No, I'm not doing any circus

4
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:17,260
maneuvers. But hello, welcome. Today is Wednesday. Told you at some point midweek.

5
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,870
Just going to turn it on. Wednesday or Thursday is Wednesday. Here we are.

6
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:32,950
Gonna be just chilling out playing this game that I've had my eye on for a while. It's called

7
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:44,310
the Eternal Cylinder. It's a game where you have little alien creatures and their planet is being

8
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:50,069
destroyed and you have to save them and help them and it just seemed kind of interesting. So I was

9
00:01:50,069 --> 00:02:05,260
like, you know what? Why not? Let's just do it. Gonna be kind of in the same energy level as the

10
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:15,909
plans for a zombie stream. Just going to relax, hang out for a little bit, chill. I love alien

11
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:34,280
creatures. Why do you hate pizza tower? I don't. I don't. Put it on the list. Is this going to be

12
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:41,159
seven hours? No, no, I don't. I mean, probably just a few hours, three, four. I'm just chilling.

13
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:55,159
I'm just here to chill. Bro, where is Frog Detective? Okay, I promise Frog Detective 3

14
00:02:56,139 --> 00:03:03,460
will happen in February. If it doesn't happen in February, then you can be very upset with me.

15
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:17,979
If on March 1st you have not seen, if I have not streamed Frog Detective 3,

16
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:31,750
then I'm in big trouble. Anyways, let's go. Don't want to waste too much time. I'm very interested

17
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:37,349
in what this game is. It could be really crazy. It could be chill. Actually, I don't think this

18
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:45,030
is going to be that chill, chill. Cause I mean, we're avoiding the destruction of this species'

19
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:52,069
planet. I think. I don't think this is like, Oh yeah. Just like chilling out. I don't know.

20
00:03:52,069 --> 00:04:01,379
It's kind of, it's probably going to be a little wacky. Yeah. The eternal cylinder. Let's just start.

21
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:07,939
Can you hear it? Well, maybe once upon a time in the age of the eternal cylinder, they lived a

22
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:16,339
family of little creatures called the Trebum. Trebum are not the strongest nor the fastest,

23
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:23,220
and they do not have sharp teeth. They would make easy prey for the terrible force that came to their

24
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:33,899
planet. But Trebum are loyal and resourceful and very, very stubborn. Okay. It is with such a Trebum

25
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:41,560
that our story begin. One clever little creature born into a cruel world who would be instrumental

26
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:55,160
in bringing prosperity to its kind. That's me. Is this like Spore? I don't think so. I think.

27
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:17,420
I don't know. We'll find out. Okay. I wonder what happened. Pretty. What an unfortunate place for a

28
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:28,500
beginning. Okay. And now what? Run. Something inside him said run. Run. This is a controller

29
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:47,449
game. What is that? Oh my God. There's a giant wave behind here. I, this is a controller game.

30
00:05:47,449 --> 00:06:16,100
Holy shit. Okay. Don't stop running. I'm not. I'm going. I can't make this. Am I going to die?

31
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:28,170
Oh shit. Can I jump? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? The great crushing

32
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:34,939
thing, the great cylinder had stopped. Perhaps it was safe here for a little while. This pub G?

33
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:41,829
How quickly it learned to use its legs and its trunk. But these things were not so much learned

34
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:50,680
as they were remembered. They were a gift from the strange voice it heard in its mind.

35
00:06:50,680 --> 00:07:00,379
Are these evil? That too was a kind of memory. Oh, what did I just do? Okay. What? What? Oh,

36
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:06,470
that was weird. What did I just do? Okay. Choose materials you've collected. Okay.

37
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:15,480
And do what? Just eat it? Just when it was starting to get used to its legs,

38
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:22,660
the food from the jumping creature gave it new ones with the right substances. Oh shit. A

39
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:29,779
trebum can transform and adapt to many challenges. Okay. So if I eat, it's kind of like Kirby.

40
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,029
Shoot anything from your inventory. Try shooting water at the flying bugs.

41
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:54,439
Shoot. Okay. So I have water in my nose. Okay. We eat that, right? What? Do I like breathe this in

42
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:15,269
that face? It's kind of oops. Okay. I got, should I eat this? Well, oh, no, no, no, no,

43
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:24,089
come back here. Okay. I just shot it out. Hold on. How do I eat that? Okay. I cannot eat this.

44
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:51,769
Should I suck in more than one? I got mushrooms. Eat the mushrooms. What did that do? This might

45
00:08:51,769 --> 00:09:10,940
just be healing. What is that? I can only hold three different types of things. All right. That's

46
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:25,419
good to know. This is technically a mushroom. Okay. How much can I hold? Should I store a bunch

47
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:43,480
of this? Like a gerbil? 10? 10 each, you think? We'll do it. Come on. Suck it up. Well, eight's

48
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:57,740
fine. The trebum was drawn to a bright light or perhaps to the creature next to it. A creature.

49
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:09,659
There is something over there. What is that? It's like a brontosaurus. Except for the grass growing

50
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:18,279
on the old one's head. They were very much alike. What? Surrounded by this light,

51
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,360
the trebum knew things it had not known before. It knew the older trebum had carried this light

52
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:32,279
for a long, long time. Oh, that's the same species. And it knew that now that responsibility had passed

53
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:40,070
to the next generation. Yes. This young trebum had to carry the light to those great towers in the

54
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:50,039
distance. It could have stayed here to learn many old things, but the cylinder would not allow it.

55
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:58,710
Is it going to start up again? Stanley Parable. Yeah. What makes that happen?

56
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:06,740
Run. The inner voice said run. The towers would not stop the cylinder. I can suck it up. Activated.

57
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:27,659
I'm strong. Roll to move faster. Okay. So I'd go for this thing. I'm going to just say I'm

58
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:31,340
legally drinking alcohol right now. The cylinder would not be stopped.

59
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:44,980
All right. Okay. Is it going to stop? Wait, what? Didn't it say this thing? How do I stop this?

60
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:55,340
Wait, I didn't listen. You got to get out of here. Get out of here. This is like mouth monster.

61
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:13,830
Oh shit. No, don't. No. The voice inside the trebum's memories assured it that while the

62
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:22,139
tower stood, the trebum would be safe. The power of the eternal cylinder was contained for now.

63
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:26,250
Okay. So you block it with this stuff. I want to get a look at this. Is this thing?

64
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:33,929
What are you doing? Relative tranquility gave the trebum a chance to think about its family.

65
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:41,610
I'm not meant to be alone. So where were the others? I wanted to make a friend,

66
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:46,649
I wanted to make a friend. I didn't know. We've both just survived that together. You'd think

67
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:51,610
that we would have sort of like a Wizard of Oz moment where it's like, hey, we both have the same

68
00:12:51,610 --> 00:13:07,080
shit going on. I guess not. Okay. Well, checkpoint. Good. Thank God. The giant mouth is not a friend.

69
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:16,039
I didn't know everything was dangerous. Okay. The voice inside the trebum's memories assured it

70
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:22,899
that while the tower stood, the trebum would be safe. The power of the eternal cylinder was

71
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:34,970
contained for now. This thing is crazy looking. You want to share food gave the trebum a chance

72
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:42,169
to think about its family. Trebum are not meant to live alone. So where were the others? We're

73
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:54,149
going to find more. Okay. Ready to eat this stuff. I feel like there's a lot of random things I can

74
00:13:54,149 --> 00:14:00,820
collect. All right. These are like eggs over there. This counts as water. Oh, I have like a water

75
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:14,980
meter. Okay. So I got to find more friends. This character looks like you. Yeah, maybe a little.

76
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:27,029
Our young friend had found an egg, a trebum egg with one of his siblings inside.

77
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:31,509
Okay. The egg had been abandoned, but it could still be made to hatch.

78
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:43,370
All that was needed was a source of heat. I'm going to break this if I move it. This looks like

79
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:51,460
kind of an incubator. Oh, put it down. I know. Okay. This is like the, oh,

80
00:14:53,860 --> 00:15:03,820
Wugwool. Okay. Hey, hey, hey, don't just eat stuff. Don't just eat stuff. I don't wait. I can't

81
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:13,669
control Wugwool. Wugwool just has, has a mind. I like the pattern. Okay. So we got two now.

82
00:15:13,669 --> 00:15:22,570
How do I make it so you have bigger legs here? Eat this like fucking turnip, whatever this is.

83
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:38,710
Oh, that's me eating it. Here. Try one of these. Eat that. You don't want that? All right. I'll keep

84
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:50,019
it. All right. So we have another party member. This is not moving yet. So that's good. Anything

85
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:58,419
else to do here? What about this stuff? Ooh, I think it's just food. I don't think it doesn't do

86
00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:08,440
anything. I ate that grasshopper and I got legs. I can't really eat anything else. All right. There's

87
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:21,529
a mouth monster over there. I'm not going over there. I wonder how many, uh, like little people

88
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:31,610
you end up having. Do I have a life cycle? Am I just gonna die eventually? Oh, it's way too cold

89
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:41,509
over here. Get out. Can we eat something to make us have, I don't know. Let's see. Come on. Mutation

90
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:48,950
items have a lightning bolt next to them. Oh, so imagine that's just health. It's probably just

91
00:16:48,950 --> 00:17:00,679
food. Health. Did I miss something? Anything else to do? I'm very intrigued by this game.

92
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:20,180
Drink some water. Actually, yeah. It's too cold over there though. What's that? These animals?

93
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:49,750
This is fucking Dr. Sue shit. Ooh, hold on. Ooh, what does this do? How do I do that?

94
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:07,220
That's annoying. Should we both eat one? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Let's test it.

95
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:28,539
Yeah, that's what I thought. Spore two with fart noises. I think I just have to explore.

96
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:38,650
It's so cold over here though. Shit. No, this way. You're doing the auto voice. Yeah, of course. I'm

97
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:55,019
doing auto. Wait, how long can I, hold on. Are these predators? Wait, this is fuzzy. Hold on. Wait,

98
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:23,160
can we wear these? It's going to be like a sweater. Did you get one too? Now we're fuzzy. I feel like

99
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:29,960
this game is dangerous. I'm going to get, okay. Do you see anything else? Hold on. I'm going to

100
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:42,599
go this way. Oh shit. Don't die. Is there fall damage? Weird mushrooms. I need water. You just

101
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:52,549
die if you run out of water. You can swap. Oh, I can swap. Okay. Q swaps. Interesting. All right.

102
00:19:52,549 --> 00:20:19,160
There's an egg over there. Can we sneak by this thing? Oh God. Is it awake? Get me out of here.

103
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:44,059
A new family member. Gui. Okay. Hi, Gui. Okay, so we're, Gui doesn't have any protection from

104
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:55,220
heat though. I mean cold. What the fuck did you just do? I think Gui needs fur, right? We need,

105
00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:07,210
hold on. No, no, no. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We sharing it? I think we, yeah, we shared it.

106
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:25,349
Why can I not move? Okay. I can't move with this creature. Why not? I can't physically move. That's

107
00:21:25,349 --> 00:21:43,210
strange. Okay. Well, whatever. I got three. I need water. I have to find a pond or something.

108
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:50,779
Wait, there's water here. This is frozen water. Can we like break it? Can we drink out of this?

109
00:21:50,779 --> 00:22:07,220
Come on. There's gotta be something I can drink. Get the water eggs. Oh, that's a good idea.

110
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:26,470
Why can I not control this guy? Oh, this is water. Okay. We're going to die. There's like a big lake

111
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:43,660
over here. Can I just stick my face in here? Just drink it? All right. Yes, we can do this.

112
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:56,900
Come drink. Make sure you get, yeah, there we go. I have lost control of this character. I can,

113
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:10,490
all I can do is drink. Satisfied? This thing hasn't started moving. Should I swim over

114
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:23,029
there or anything? It's all salt water. Where to go? It's too young to swim across. Watch for the

115
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:28,539
beams of light that come from activated towers. They will point you to objectives or areas of

116
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:37,589
interest. Ooh. It was hard for the Trevim to know what to do or where to go, but the friendly voice

117
00:23:37,589 --> 00:23:45,109
suggested this was not the right way. Stream remote? To find your path, it said you must follow

118
00:23:45,109 --> 00:23:52,279
the beam of light. I did not get Luigi'd. To the tip of the tower and stay away from the deep waters

119
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:59,849
where the old things dwell. I didn't get, I did not get Luigi'd. Wait, everybody should have the

120
00:23:59,849 --> 00:24:13,430
little horn, right? Where's the horn? I just heard it. Or maybe not. Okay, so we need to go this way.

121
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:33,589
Did everybody have a horn? Why not? Yeah, might as well take one. I think this is my favorite,

122
00:24:33,589 --> 00:24:56,460
like the blue. So everybody has access to that. All right, let's control. All right, this thing

123
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:06,259
wants me to go this way. We could probably fuck somebody up. Not that that's what I want to do.

124
00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:17,369
I'm just making it clear that, what's that? Wait, the snail, that was just open. What was that? Did

125
00:25:17,369 --> 00:25:36,859
you see that? What does that sound? That was a free, yeah, that's a freaky snail. What do we do

126
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:51,559
this guy? I don't know, I got him. I don't know. What should we do with him? Kill it? Why? What

127
00:25:51,559 --> 00:26:17,160
if it could help us? Wait, that guy just attacked me. Get out of here. Just jump over. Wait.

128
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:37,059
He's like a little weirdo. Get out of here. What the fuck? I'm gonna play this instrument

129
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:50,599
ever again, I promise. Holy shit, that was crazy. Okay. Whatever that is, it's big and I don't know

130
00:26:50,599 --> 00:27:12,410
if it's friendly. Something's loud. Will you go down water? Wait, there's an egg. A fish. I just

131
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:50,009
got a fish. Hold on. Get rid of this. All right. Get the egg. How do we get up there? We just suck

132
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:57,049
it up from here? I don't know. Oh my god. Get out of the water. Get out of the water. We think we're

133
00:27:57,049 --> 00:28:05,700
dying. We're struggling. Get out of the water. We're struggling so bad. Please don't drown. Okay.

134
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:16,680
Oh my god. That was bad. Can I knock the, wait, come here. I have an idea. Fuck. That was a

135
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:31,109
gridded. That was a bad idea. Stack them up. Can we do that? Can I jump on top of one of their heads?

136
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:46,140
Maybe it's the fish that has, wait, the fish. This is part of the fish here. This is just food.

137
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:58,700
Yeah, it's just food. Wait a minute. This is something else. Back to the surface. Quick.

138
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:18,460
What does this do? All right. Not all, don't all of you eat that. Don't all of you eat that. This guy

139
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:37,220
just turned into a cement brick. I don't know if that was a good idea. Well, I don't know. What

140
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:50,490
about the fish? All right. This is an actual fish. What do you do? Frog? Swimming more quickly but

141
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:57,019
can form a high jump out of the water. All right. Cool. So we've got float guy, frog guy, and

142
00:29:58,569 --> 00:30:05,420
whatever I can do with you, I kind of, I can't move for some reason. I think it's bugged,

143
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:13,019
but I can't walk along with this character. I think it's a bug. I wonder, can I tell people

144
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:26,299
to stop just to stay or is there like a command? Maybe restart it. Save and reload. Yeah, we'll

145
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:42,390
save it. Save and then main menu. Look at the tutorial. I, I mean, I, I just, I can't move with

146
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:54,619
that, that one for some reason. I don't know why. Is he too heavy? That's possible, but I don't know.

147
00:30:54,619 --> 00:31:01,619
I think one of the incubators is over here. He's going to be in this one. This game's cute. I like

148
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:24,859
it. You just kind of get like friends. We all have a job. Okay. Okay. Or when somebody dies,

149
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:43,539
I'm going to be really sad. Ah, that's way more helpful. If I hold Q, I can just select the one

150
00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:52,009
I want to control. This one's still bugged, but it's all right. All right. Well, what do I want

151
00:31:52,009 --> 00:32:13,059
this one to eat? Reload it, save, and then just load the save. Use the broken one as cannon fodder.

152
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:28,230
We have to go over there and I'm, I can tell you, I'm not super thrilled about it. There we go. Okay.

153
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:51,099
I can control this one now. Stop sucking up random stuff. I feel like these guys,

154
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:57,160
I feel like this is going to eat one of us. Right? Who, I don't want, I'm not getting rid of the,

155
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:05,880
the big one. Oh God. All right. Should I just get up? This door had been built for Trebum.

156
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:16,539
It gave them hope that in this large and dangerous world, some places had been made for them.

157
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:26,970
Whoa. What's that thing? What did I just get? Some ingredients cannot be eaten until their

158
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:31,930
edible interiors have been exposed. There are multiple ways to break open ingredients. Try

159
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:36,440
experimenting with throwing them, crushing them, or feeding them to other creatures.

160
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:44,259
Items with a breakable exterior are marked with a yellow border. Oh my, I feel so bad.

161
00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:51,339
We just like took that snails. I don't know what we did, but I don't, I'm kind of sad about it.

162
00:33:54,390 --> 00:34:06,279
All right. Everybody in. I broke it. I don't, I don't know what that is. Who should eat this?

163
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:19,130
I mean, you've got like the big butt power. You've got the swimming power. I have jumping power.

164
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:31,829
The new guy here. Try this. This is going to snail power. What does, what would that even mean?

165
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:42,460
Whoa. Make some shiny, sparkly, and very attractive.

166
00:34:45,420 --> 00:35:01,960
This is like the attractive one. Okay. Well, cool. Let's go. I wonder if this is like a little

167
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:17,639
hideout. Hmm. Have to quickly change the group leader. Hold to manually select. Don't worry.

168
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:22,170
If you lose sight of one of your family members, you do not need to wait for other TREBUM. They

169
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:25,690
will always manage to get where the group leader is. Okay. So you don't have to worry about them.

170
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:39,659
So they will always get to where you're going or better for us, I guess. It's like, Ooh,

171
00:35:39,659 --> 00:35:57,239
what is that? To the top, right? I'm kind of resource. We should eat like a kind of like

172
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:06,949
alien watermelon. All right. Everybody eat these. I'm going to clear up the inventory.

173
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:22,860
Sell that one. It's rare. This is a family. Nobody low on water. I think everyone's fine.

174
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:36,699
What do you have so many mushrooms? Just eat them. Oh my God. I just ate everything.

175
00:36:36,699 --> 00:36:48,789
Okay. Don't all of you do that. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. You ate all the food.

176
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:58,710
Was that our, wait, I probably shouldn't have not. I probably shouldn't have done that.

177
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:11,659
Interact. Somehow this ancient statue transferred knowledge to the TREBUM.

178
00:37:11,659 --> 00:37:27,690
This tells you what everything does. Inventory. Oh, he's got a way bigger inventory. Okay. That's

179
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:44,900
cool. All right. You hold all the snacks. You're going to be the snack storage. The map is here.

180
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:55,510
Very nice. It was as if a memory had been stored inside it, waiting for someone to absorb it.

181
00:37:55,510 --> 00:38:01,849
And as soon as this knowledge had entered their minds, the TREBUM realized that there was a great

182
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:08,150
library of information hidden away in the web of their memories. But why was the knowledge of a

183
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:18,489
specific ingredient placed here in this TREBUM made of stone? I wonder. Oh, more of this.

184
00:38:18,489 --> 00:38:39,059
Do you collect this dust? They're learning. Okay. Well, can we get it? Are we supposed to?

185
00:38:39,059 --> 00:39:09,420
We did it. All right. Who wants to eat this weird cube? It's so stylish. The stylish cube.

186
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:23,510
So yeah, I can fit in here. Ah, it opens the door.

187
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:43,349
Garumo the Elder. I'm going to start talking. Wait, this is a, oh, this is an adult? Inside the cave,

188
00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:50,760
the TREBUM found a living elder. It had been waiting in this chamber for a long, long time.

189
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:56,679
The elder told them it was happy to see some friends before the cylinder came. This is kind

190
00:39:56,679 --> 00:40:04,059
of sad. It said, you are young. So you never knew the time when our people could shape shift at will.

191
00:40:04,059 --> 00:40:12,409
We TREBUM are inheritors of a vast tree of abilities, abilities passed on to all future TREBUM.

192
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:19,989
But this power is being taken away. Beware the servants of the cylinder. They will seek to hurt

193
00:40:19,989 --> 00:40:26,889
you at every opportunity. And they have the power to rob you of your abilities. Like a car? But if

194
00:40:26,889 --> 00:40:34,619
you persevere, one day you will find a way to protect yourselves from their evil light. Farewell,

195
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:42,699
my brave friends. I fear I am too old and tired to join you. May you find a way to prosper

196
00:40:42,699 --> 00:40:58,579
in this time of struggles. All right, so thanks for helping. Here, have a mushroom on me.

197
00:40:58,579 --> 00:41:14,650
Okay, so we can go that way. Wait, wait, wait, wait. He almost shot it up his nose.

198
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:22,099
What is this? This is like a bath? It's like a little bird bath. Everybody,

199
00:41:22,099 --> 00:41:34,250
should we get into the, this is like a jacuzzi? Easy. Oh, it's a place to fill up water.

200
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:47,219
You should make the fat one eat a cube. Maybe. Is everybody good? Everybody have water? Make sure

201
00:41:47,219 --> 00:41:56,489
to fill up. We're not, we're gonna get out of here. Should the fat one eat a cube? I don't know if I

202
00:41:56,489 --> 00:42:21,050
want another big cube. Should I? Yes. Okay. All right, so he's not, it squished him down.

203
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:32,260
He's not big anymore. It's a cube. So the power is, some of them don't stack. So now I just have two

204
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:41,050
cubes. I lost my, I had a bunch of watermelons. Turn him back. I can't turn him back. He's,

205
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:50,489
he's like this permanently. Everybody else want to be a cube? No, we are, we have two cubes. That's

206
00:42:50,489 --> 00:43:05,219
good enough. Make him eat something. You can't have a double cube, right? Yeah, just need to

207
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:20,710
find another one of those fishes. That's fine. All right. Let's keep going. Load the save. No,

208
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:29,639
we have to experiment. Give them nicknames. I don't want to, because I know for a fact that

209
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:34,119
some of them are going to die. Like, I just know it. You know it. I know it. It was not easy to

210
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:41,780
leave the cave, but the elder had urged them to go forward. Suddenly they felt the weight of their

211
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:49,530
many tasks to find their trebum siblings, to restore the powers their people had lost.

212
00:43:49,530 --> 00:44:00,500
They all seemed a little daunting, but even when they are afraid, trebum are stubborn.

213
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:15,780
You okay? How do we rescue this one? Food? Here, eat this. Can you eat that? What about water?

214
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:42,250
It didn't work. What? I'm trying. Grunk? What is this? What? I need four. Oh, okay.

215
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:46,809
We have to feed him for the of the. All right. All right. All right. We have to save this guy.

216
00:44:46,809 --> 00:45:02,230
All that little stardust. Fuck. I just wasted so much water. Okay. Do I still have the indicator

217
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:32,360
telling me where to go? Let's get water first. Anything happen at night? Oh, fuck. Don't come

218
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:49,940
in here. I need the jumper. It did say, don't worry. They will find a way to you. I'm looking

219
00:45:49,940 --> 00:46:02,630
for more of that stardust. The cave had more dust. Oh, is that right there? No. Checking to see.

220
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:14,010
What's this? Weird mushrooms. I don't want them. Whoa. What the fuck is this? These are different.

221
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:31,239
These are like different eggs. This is bad. Should I hatch this? We're gonna take more than one.

222
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:42,360
Here. Okay. Somebody grab that one. Grab that one. All right. All right. All right. All right.

223
00:46:42,360 --> 00:47:01,320
All right. Where's an incubator? Break one? No, I don't want to do that. Incubator. Get the

224
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:21,340
stardust, bro. Hold on. Is there no incubator around here? There's one over there. Bro. What

225
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:32,280
is this stuff for? Exiting the blue energy dome that radiates from the tower you activated will

226
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:37,880
awaken the eternal cylinder. Warning. Not all towers have the same radius of protection. Some

227
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:47,699
may be weaker. Oh, when I walk. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Get out of there. No, no, no, no.

228
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:52,710
Run, run, run. Is this their egg? Is this yours? You can have back. Take it back. You can have back.

229
00:47:52,710 --> 00:48:03,110
You can have back. Yeah. Take it back. Take it back. Run. I think that was, was that their egg?

230
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:07,159
I don't know. Just run. Just get away. Get away. Get away. I don't know where to go. I don't know

231
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:13,019
where to go. I'm freaking out. All right. Where's the egg? Where'd it go? Give it to me. I'm taking

232
00:48:13,019 --> 00:48:25,590
it. I don't care. Well, what? Oh, shit. The cylinder resumed its destruction. Nothing could

233
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:36,019
stop it forever. Yeah. They need to roll to safety to find another tower. Crap. All right. Come on.

234
00:48:36,019 --> 00:48:43,610
Come on. Come on. Come on. What? I don't know what this is, but I want it. It's like a weird

235
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:58,920
magical... Okay, go. This one right here. Oh, no, our... The friend. I forgot. I forgot about that.

236
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:11,300
Oh, no. That's not good. That's too bad. That's too bad. Grungo, whatever his name was.

237
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:29,849
You murdered him. Keep going. Come on. Oh my God. Go, go, go, go, go. Reload. No, it's okay.

238
00:49:29,849 --> 00:49:43,909
I made the mistake. I'm going to live with it. Oh, that's sad. It's okay. Please reload. I can't.

239
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:59,400
I made the mistake. I have to live with it. The Trebem found themselves almost as lost as they

240
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:05,000
had been in the beginning. And where is the fifth? The most powerful of all the Trebems.

241
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:13,030
It was only natural to be confused, it said. They had been born into a strange, broken world,

242
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:19,619
cut off from the history of their ancestors. Everyone was a little lost these days. What

243
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:27,219
mattered was to keep going, to keep looking for answers, to keep carrying the light they held

244
00:50:27,219 --> 00:50:36,840
within them. The light that stopped the cylinder. Why is this one almost dead? Okay. That would have

245
00:50:36,840 --> 00:51:06,789
been sad. Water. I can't find any. You're kind of not understanding the fart dynamic. Sorry about

246
00:51:06,789 --> 00:51:22,599
that. Let's continue. That looks like poisonous. I don't think I want to go in there. Is this over

247
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:51,159
here? I'm going to go in this. Okay. What's this? We're all making it out alive. The strange,

248
00:51:51,159 --> 00:51:59,780
eerie temple. The Trebem felt something stir in their memories. There was a great power in this

249
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:08,010
place. Something from the days when even the elders were young. Perhaps it could help them.

250
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:21,349
A stir is here. What's up, dude? All right, this is a power. Who should have this? I think I'm

251
00:52:21,349 --> 00:52:31,400
giving it to you. Eat that. I don't know what this is going to do. Hopefully it doesn't do anything

252
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:52,099
weird. Okay, so he attracts the flies. He's just cool hair now. This attracts these flies. Wait,

253
00:52:52,099 --> 00:53:02,869
what am I looking at here? What is this? This is a human. This is a human. No, wait, what the

254
00:53:02,869 --> 00:53:15,030
fuck is that? What is this? It's like a human in a human. All right. Well, what do I do here?

255
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:32,840
Get those. I think I have to bring them over here. Yeah. Wait, what's this? I don't know. What does

256
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:42,780
this do? I don't know. They're like little crystals. I'm taking them. The humans have mutations too.

257
00:53:50,699 --> 00:54:05,219
That was very ominous. Uh, okay. So I think I just have to bring flies over here to follow me.

258
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:22,019
All right, here they come. Okay. Now can somebody take that? All right, who has a room?

259
00:54:22,019 --> 00:54:37,659
You. No, maybe not. Oh, wait. Could not retrieve any helpful information from the Trebum memory

260
00:54:37,659 --> 00:54:50,019
cluster. Whoa. So was that giving me? The Trebum were disoriented for a moment. It was like a

261
00:54:50,019 --> 00:54:54,019
finished map. Something new had entered their memories and they needed to make sense of it.

262
00:54:55,059 --> 00:55:04,920
It seemed to be a map. And on this map, a location had been marked. If they understood correctly,

263
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:11,960
there was some manner of serpent, a guardian, a greater being of some kind, somehow linked

264
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:20,460
to a safe haven. Could they find refuge there? Their ancestors must have created this map

265
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:27,050
for a reason. All right. So we have to go find the big giant serpent thing. So hold on. Let me,

266
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:33,340
how do I get to this menu? Can I press a certain button to get there? How do I get to that menu?

267
00:55:40,230 --> 00:56:03,239
M escape. Press the map key. Hold on. Let me roll. Spit open inventory. Interact. I think it's I.

268
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:10,460
Yes. Okay. So a map it's marked on. It's now marked, which is up here. So we've got to go

269
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:24,460
out here through here to here. Good luck. So this gives you a map fragment piece. Wait,

270
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:42,070
hold on. What's that? You see that up here? I wonder if I can eat that. Can I grab that?

271
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:53,380
Oh, thank God. Tapioca pudding. Yay or nay? Uh, tapioca pudding is probably,

272
00:56:54,579 --> 00:57:02,579
it's probably a nay for me. I don't hate it, but I'm not, I wouldn't order it. I know that a lot of

273
00:57:02,579 --> 00:57:16,650
some of what Boba right is tapioca. That's, that's all right. Ooh, where did that just go? Oh,

274
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:39,690
okay. A little ball. I'm gonna pick this up. I gotta break it. Shit. What is, okay. We have

275
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:47,909
two cubes. One of the cubes is not going to be a cube anymore. Should we give it to the attractive

276
00:57:47,909 --> 00:58:03,659
one or the, I don't know, give it a blue. All right. The attractive cube or the blue. Okay.

277
00:58:03,659 --> 00:58:20,440
Well, we'll give it a blue. So much bullshit. Get rid of these stupid mushrooms. Get this out of

278
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:42,150
here. Stop eating and get rid of that. Let's see what happens. Plated body. Okay. I got a shell,

279
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:49,369
but this, this one's a fight. This one can fight now. Turtle. All right. Let's fill up.

280
00:58:49,369 --> 00:59:00,059
Now we got to get out of here. I kind of want to see if I can get that.

281
00:59:00,059 --> 00:59:08,099
You know what I mean? Can I break this shit? I feel like I can use this for some reason.

282
00:59:08,099 --> 00:59:25,239
These little crystal things. I feel like I can get that. Should we water at it? Oh, it worked.

283
00:59:25,239 --> 00:59:34,730
It actually worked. All right. What is this thing? I don't know who's going to eat this.

284
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:37,769
Dude, what is this? I don't know what this is going to do. Should I hold it?

285
00:59:37,769 --> 00:59:51,670
I'm going to hold onto this. Yeah. I'm going to hold this. We have turtle.

286
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:57,989
We have fish. We have jumping spiky haired dude. And we have attractive cube. I think this is good

287
00:59:57,989 --> 01:00:18,139
for now. I think this is okay. Let's keep going. Would you please, uh, project song void? I think

288
01:00:18,139 --> 01:00:31,659
so. What manner of strange beast lurk behind the center? The trebum were deeply unsettled by this

289
01:00:31,659 --> 01:00:39,690
new mystery, but though some part of them was curious, they were certain it would be best not

290
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:49,000
to find out. Where is everybody? Uh, yeah. Get me out of there. The narrative just cough.

291
01:00:50,039 --> 01:01:11,079
They should not find out. There's an incubator here. Um, I wish I had one of them. What is this?

292
01:01:11,079 --> 01:01:21,480
This is just food. I don't want to go yet. Holy shit. What's that? Oh my God. All right.

293
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:34,599
There's too many things. Um, just eat it. Water processor? The water processor mutation is

294
01:01:34,599 --> 01:01:40,920
constantly processing ingredients found in its inventory slots, transforming them into water.

295
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:45,639
Note that this does not extract any nutrients from them. Be mindful of what you absorb with

296
01:01:45,639 --> 01:01:51,340
this trebum as its body will automatically process any organic ingredients stored inside.

297
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:58,489
The trebum were excited by this discovery. This new mutation would allow them to extract water

298
01:01:58,489 --> 01:02:04,570
from ingredients that were otherwise quite dry. Don't do that. But the voice cautioned them to

299
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:12,820
be careful. More water was useful, but this process would not extract any nutrients. They

300
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:20,869
would have to use it carefully and wisely. Uh, somebody just turned into a water filter. All

301
01:02:20,869 --> 01:02:41,349
right. So let's go with this. I mean, maybe the thing that's 10, right? Maybe this too. Okay.

302
01:02:41,349 --> 01:02:49,900
This is just going to be producing water. You put dry things in it and it just makes,

303
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:55,909
okay. So this thing, it just needs to suck up a bunch of junk, right? All right. Let's keep going.

304
01:02:55,909 --> 01:03:19,019
Oh God. Okay. We need another egg. You gave him too many items. Oh shit. All right. I said,

305
01:03:19,019 --> 01:03:42,699
you mean only give stuff to this character when we need water. Does that mean, all right,

306
01:03:42,699 --> 01:03:57,940
when you're looking for an egg, looking for eggs, that's interesting. Whatever that is,

307
01:03:57,940 --> 01:04:08,659
I want to go look at it. Does it show where we are on the map? It does. All right. We need to

308
01:04:08,659 --> 01:04:25,980
go up here. So I, let me, let me investigate this. All right. Go, go, go, go. Do not aggro that thing.

309
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:35,880
I want this weird building over here. Is this, is this building, whatever this weird like big

310
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:41,059
piece of artwork it looks like. All right. What's this? Oh fuck. Everybody's cold.

311
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:51,619
We still don't, we don't have that mutation. I thought we had it. All right. I won't be here

312
01:04:51,619 --> 01:05:10,360
long. What is in here? Nothing in here. It's like a cool thing. There's gotta be something over here.

313
01:05:17,449 --> 01:05:20,409
Well, no, no, no, don't just pick stuff up. You're going to turn it into water. Actually,

314
01:05:20,409 --> 01:05:33,369
that's okay. All right. We're going to get out of here. What's this? I don't know what this does.

315
01:05:33,369 --> 01:05:37,380
I don't know. This is somebody take this. We're going to get, we gotta get out of the cold now.

316
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:42,170
Get out of the cold, out of the cold. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. How do I get out of the cold?

317
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:44,889
We've got to go this way. Back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up.

318
01:05:44,889 --> 01:06:00,059
Come on, get out, out, out, out, out. We're okay. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out,

319
01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:05,699
get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out,

320
01:06:05,699 --> 01:06:16,860
get out, get out, get out. Don't die, please. Oh, wait, the thing's moving. The thing's moving.

321
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:36,599
It's moving. It's moving. Go, go, go, go, go. Eat this? What happened? Oh shit. Whoa, no.

322
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:42,599
No, no, no, no. Back it up, back it up. Back, back, back. Back, back, back, back, back,

323
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:48,760
back, back. This way, this way, this way. Oh no, that's awful. Oh no. We're all gonna die.

324
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,400
We're all gonna die. Follow me, follow me, please.

325
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:59,739
Go, oh I fucked up everything. I fucked everything up. I ruined everything. It's okay,

326
01:06:59,739 --> 01:07:07,079
it's okay. It's alright. We gotta get over here. We gotta get this way, through here. We're safe.

327
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:14,019
Okay

328
01:07:14,019 --> 01:07:17,820
Come on. Oh

329
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:25,230
Goodness, okay, so that was a little bit of a problem. That was a little bit of a problem. I have to activate it. Oh

330
01:07:27,219 --> 01:07:29,219
shit

331
01:07:31,179 --> 01:07:32,780
Was lost

332
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:36,380
There was no more pointed running. Yes, there is yes, there is under

333
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:43,000
Consume and I thought it was gonna stop it. I thought it was gonna block it. I thought it was gonna block it

334
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,300
I thought I was gonna block it. Is there no more of those things?

335
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:56,380
My god

336
01:07:56,380 --> 01:08:03,650
Okay, I didn't know I had to activate it. That was terrible. I feel so bad

337
01:08:06,099 --> 01:08:16,250
Okay. Well, did the auto save this is two minutes ago. Okay, we're good

338
01:08:16,729 --> 01:08:27,659
We need to just go this way. I had it right just get out of here. I do want to eat though

339
01:08:27,659 --> 01:08:32,199
I want to eat this

340
01:08:32,439 --> 01:08:35,380
Because this thing makes water what the fuck did you just do?

341
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:40,739
Okay, we're good. So now this thing processes more water

342
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,199
So it's better

343
01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:55,979
Here we go. Okay, everyone sit out here for a sec. I'm not gonna activate it yet. Please get away from us

344
01:08:56,260 --> 01:09:14,659
Is there an egg here egg egg? Wait people say an egg. Is there an egg? Was there an egg? I don't see one. Oh

345
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:29,220
My god, everything is so dangerous

346
01:09:29,939 --> 01:09:33,260
It's a big peach egg

347
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,140
No

348
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:37,140
Guys, that's a mouth monster

349
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:42,300
Hey

350
01:09:42,300 --> 01:10:05,130
We're good. What about this thing? Do you do anything? Can we do anything with this or is it just a set piece?

351
01:10:05,489 --> 01:10:37,500
You left an egg. I don't think I did. I got plenty of time. I don't see anything

352
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:52,859
Usually they'd be like a little oh no. Look at the distance gonna make it you're gonna make it. Oh

353
01:10:55,779 --> 01:11:19,819
They're not gonna make it. All right, it's wrong. Oh wait, you're hungry. Does anybody have food?

354
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:25,260
Okay, the stomach meter represents your party's food and energy level

355
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:28,810
It's divided into two parts stomach and the energy pouch

356
01:11:29,050 --> 01:11:35,939
I'm a calls all the food you consume and fills up depending on the nutritional qualities the ingredients you eat and digest food when

357
01:11:35,979 --> 01:11:43,550
Resting or standing still which depletes the stomach and fills the energy pouch and you pouch is not only necessary

358
01:11:44,069 --> 01:11:48,270
For your tribune to survive it's essential for replenishing the energy the tribune used to roll

359
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:56,279
Those energy you have the more slowly your stamina and endurance will regenerate. Okay rolling consumes a lot of energy

360
01:11:56,279 --> 01:12:01,439
So if you plan on rolling to distant safe areas, you must be prepared as their fear faded

361
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:08,409
The trebum started feeling weak and tired with all the excitement and adventure

362
01:12:08,409 --> 01:12:16,899
They've neglected their most basic needs the sound of an empty stomach reminded them that survival requires more than

363
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:21,590
Escaping from danger. Okay, you also have to eat

364
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:28,210
Luckily when the cylinder is the internal the trebum is the capacity to store food in their bodies

365
01:12:28,670 --> 01:12:36,020
But they still need to digest it to gain the vital energy that gives them strength and for such small creatures

366
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:38,979
They do require rather a lot of food

367
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:46,510
I fortunately the Savannah was rich in flora and fauna which would satisfy their little bellies

368
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:48,949
without necessarily

369
01:12:48,949 --> 01:12:50,149
triggering a

370
01:12:50,149 --> 01:12:55,430
Mutation so I think you share it. It looks like it's when I eat it goes plus plus plus

371
01:12:55,430 --> 01:13:09,279
I think it's for everybody. Alright, so they're introducing mechanics as we go. That's interesting. Whatever that is. Alright, I'm fairly safe right now

372
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:26,939
I'm looking for eggs. This is games really cool. I like it

373
01:13:26,939 --> 01:13:47,779
So I'm imagining you probably can get anti poison protection or something. You should use that thing

374
01:13:47,779 --> 01:13:56,789
You already have um, who has the turtle has it? I think I'm gonna feed this to

375
01:13:57,149 --> 01:14:20,359
The attractive cube third I can use this mutation to look for specific ingredients by tagging them in the compendium

376
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:28,270
Okay of all the changes that trebum were experiencing growing a third

377
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:33,880
I was the strangest one yet and make things even stranger

378
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:37,180
This I seem to look in two directions at once

379
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:42,329
Into the world and into their memories like the eye icon

380
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:49,600
To find in the real world any element that was contained in the web of their memories

381
01:14:50,439 --> 01:14:55,020
It was truly a remarkable mutation. What should I look for?

382
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:06,800
Where's the thing to make the big puffy one? One of these here look for this

383
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:23,819
Okay, if I do that, then how do I know where it is? I wonder looks kind of funny

384
01:15:23,859 --> 01:15:34,729
Can you do eggs? Can you look for eggs? That's a good point egg yolk

385
01:15:37,779 --> 01:15:54,239
Egg shroom, I don't think I can look for them individually all hail attractive cube seer of the unseen

386
01:15:55,079 --> 01:16:04,600
There's a creature tab

387
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:32,329
Alright we need to find an egg. I need to find a fifth party member. Mm-hmm. Alright new friend. They need incubator

388
01:16:32,329 --> 01:16:54,149
I don't see wait that one over here sacrifice the rest of them. You only need one. I

389
01:16:55,699 --> 01:17:10,340
Highly doubt that here we go. What we're good. Once I get more than five or six of these

390
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:25,720
I feel like I'm gonna start losing track. Alright, what do we get? Come on out friend grew Temu. Hello grew Temu

391
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:39,750
What are we gonna turn you into? We'll figure that out. Alright, we need to eat who has food you do eat a few mushrooms

392
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:54,789
What about his mouth? But

393
01:17:56,189 --> 01:18:08,670
Okay, we got a new friend. The goal is ultimately to go this way. Yeah, we're gonna go up here. There is another

394
01:18:09,489 --> 01:18:12,609
Place there, but I'm not gonna do that yet. Hold on. I feel like there might be something else

395
01:18:13,090 --> 01:18:35,899
Wait, yeah a lot of danger over here though. What is that thing? Oh

396
01:18:36,619 --> 01:18:44,180
That's weird. Oh this thing pukes. What is that doing?

397
01:18:45,630 --> 01:19:02,140
Goodness, everybody be careful. What is this thing? What the fuck? Alright, so what is this?

398
01:19:02,659 --> 01:19:08,810
Bro, that thing is disgusting

399
01:19:09,369 --> 01:19:16,140
Boy new fruits. Ooh

400
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:30,979
Wait, okay. Let's do it allows the treatment to produce a song that causes the click ball to follow them

401
01:19:31,140 --> 01:20:12,180
Yeah, but I'm so even more than one. All right, cool. What is it? Glick Bowl? Can I go any deeper? Is that it? That's it?

402
01:20:15,149 --> 01:20:37,189
Wow, what's that? Oh my god. What else do I need to do with this? Can I activate this or what?

403
01:20:37,189 --> 01:20:44,180
What's this here for? I wonder why is this activated cube hole? Ah

404
01:20:45,579 --> 01:20:53,119
That's right. Okay. I want that egg the things are gonna get out of the way is the big guy a Glick Bowl

405
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:56,300
Possibly, but I don't really want to find out

406
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:07,350
All right, the attractive cube in there

407
01:21:16,970 --> 01:21:26,819
The trebum felt a great power flowing through this cave, but they were not afraid

408
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:30,239
The power felt familiar

409
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,520
even friendly

410
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:37,260
These glowing structures were the work of their ancestors

411
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:39,750
puzzle

412
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:45,710
They water any food too. Okay

413
01:21:46,670 --> 01:22:02,189
Well, we're gonna suck up all this shit. I turn them on water storage increase your maximum water storage

414
01:22:02,630 --> 01:22:03,550
capacity

415
01:22:03,550 --> 01:22:11,270
These are upgrades cool. Okay

416
01:22:15,329 --> 01:22:22,439
They all cost six right do this

417
01:22:22,439 --> 01:22:38,449
I wonder if I should hold on to this to get another friend maximum health

418
01:22:38,689 --> 01:23:01,850
It's two in the attractive cube evolve into the larger more attractive cube, baby

419
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:18,760
I don't know. We'll find out soon enough. Alright, so I have seven. I think that's all there is here. What's this one?

420
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:38,840
Oh the maximum number of Trebum how many can we have now like we need that?

421
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:59,569
That's maximum and have more family members didn't click on one. He's the size of the stamina wheel probably health

422
01:23:59,569 --> 01:24:18,079
I want to blow through on my on my material though. You do it twice twice or save it just once

423
01:24:18,079 --> 01:24:20,449
I'm happy with that. All right

424
01:24:20,449 --> 01:24:35,550
I wonder if I lose access to this place because isn't this gonna get destroyed this thing's about to get annihilated water

425
01:24:35,550 --> 01:24:47,689
Yeah, good water. How we on food who has food?

426
01:24:52,720 --> 01:25:20,210
None of you have anything save the game. I think it actually is saving right now. Where's my fifth these crystals, too

427
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:23,989
Alright, there's this food there's water and then there are crystals

428
01:25:24,210 --> 01:25:32,159
What the fuck are these for right? Like what is this for? It's got to be something to do with this

429
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:58,659
Is even in the compendium memory cluster contains a fragment of a story about a culture hero called

430
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:20,739
Naka who was cast into the underworld by Chris. This is is this it? Yeah. Okay. So does this really do anything food?

431
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:28,890
Creatures some memory cluster. I think it's just they're on

432
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:51,229
Or in the water, I mean they're cool-looking but I don't think they do anything. I think we're good eat one

433
01:26:51,310 --> 01:27:03,609
I'm not sure you can that's right. You're not even let's go

434
01:27:03,789 --> 01:27:09,569
You're probably gonna need 30 of those in the last five minutes of the story true

435
01:27:09,810 --> 01:27:18,560
What's the objective of the game? The objective of this game is you are these little creatures and there is an eternal

436
01:27:18,819 --> 01:27:31,090
Death wall that is slowly destroying everything and you need to outrun it and live. All right, we're good

437
01:27:31,409 --> 01:27:50,010
Was that what the fuck is that? All right, I'm getting nervous. I gotta get out of here. All right, I got an egg

438
01:27:50,529 --> 01:28:09,180
Check over here. How we doing on food? We're all right, but eat pretty good

439
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:26,310
Just checking just suck up a bunch of bullshit and make sure to eat it. That's the play. There we are. All right, the

440
01:28:26,989 --> 01:28:28,989
Objective is over here

441
01:28:29,189 --> 01:28:46,380
Where straight ahead I got plenty of water plenty food a cube is so attractive speed run the game

442
01:28:46,819 --> 01:28:53,579
Speed run in the game is I'm sure there's a rolling speed mutation. You probably just run as well

443
01:28:54,180 --> 01:29:15,140
Yep, a new friend. I don't activate it yet. Yeah, this I'm sure this I don't like that thing at all

444
01:29:15,659 --> 01:29:27,789
There's two of them to that incubator was over here, right? It's way somewhere

445
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:36,069
You can't roll

446
01:29:36,069 --> 01:30:02,319
Where was it? Where I think it wasn't this far. Was it this far?

447
01:30:07,189 --> 01:30:17,369
It was definitely this far

448
01:30:17,930 --> 01:30:29,640
Where is it you have a map are those on the map is it right there is that that one

449
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:42,770
Is that what that is on the map go to the bruhs, huh? What do you mean go to the bruh?

450
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:58,810
Listen, what is that? All right, there's something. All right. I'm getting overwhelmed. Hold on

451
01:30:58,930 --> 01:31:06,619
We need to open this and then I'm going in that hole. All right, there it is. Oh

452
01:31:06,619 --> 01:31:09,939
Oh

453
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:25,229
Go this way go this way go this way go this way go this way the monsters are fucking weird in this game

454
01:31:25,310 --> 01:31:52,619
He's exactly in the area. I need to be in get out of here. Goon. Oh, okay. Goon. Oh, let's go

455
01:31:52,699 --> 01:32:08,060
What do we have six going in this hole? All right, the hole is over here. Hope this does not kill us. It'd be very sad

456
01:32:08,380 --> 01:32:23,659
You guys ready? Whoa

457
01:32:23,659 --> 01:32:27,579
Don't wait for others when entering or exiting small caves jump pads a moving plant

458
01:32:27,579 --> 01:32:32,810
They move on their own. It will follow you. I want to look at this though. There's like something up here

459
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:43,850
Can I touch that or something?

460
01:32:44,010 --> 01:32:51,699
Okay, so this is a jump pad

461
01:32:51,699 --> 01:33:03,819
Huh? Are you all right? We'll gull need more leadership. We're perfectly fine

462
01:33:04,220 --> 01:33:29,239
What do you mean need more leadership? What does that mean? We're not smart enough need more leadership. What?

463
01:33:33,539 --> 01:33:34,579
Ooh

464
01:33:34,579 --> 01:33:58,260
Something new new shit in here. Uh you all right. This is just health nothing else in there the upgrade thing

465
01:34:02,439 --> 01:34:04,439
party full need upgrade

466
01:34:08,539 --> 01:34:16,619
No, wait this he's they're gonna die down here. What do we do about this?

467
01:34:25,510 --> 01:34:46,939
Will you be able to jump higher and have the turtle show curious? I think this is the leader you need to kill them

468
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:55,640
I don't think so. I feel so bad. I really want this one. Um, how much was it?

469
01:34:55,880 --> 01:35:02,840
I'm gonna buy it. I'm buying it. I don't care if it's a waste. I want this friend

470
01:35:19,829 --> 01:35:44,819
This is kind of hard to get out of here. Okay, i'm rescuing that one. Oh, I won't have enough. That's right

471
01:35:45,220 --> 01:35:50,819
It's gonna be like four to upgrade and then it's probably gonna be four or five to get them

472
01:35:50,899 --> 01:36:02,699
It's four will I have enough to free them the question you have six

473
01:36:06,789 --> 01:36:22,699
I don't know if i'm gonna be able to do it. I think I just have to move on this game music on

474
01:36:22,859 --> 01:36:35,270
Yeah, it should be that better. Maybe we're just too low. You should just try. All right

475
01:36:35,270 --> 01:36:38,630
What if I waste all my stardust or whatever the hell this stuff is? All right

476
01:36:40,170 --> 01:36:58,060
Uh, fine. We'll do it. Why is this closed?

477
01:37:02,069 --> 01:37:07,220
It's locked off now

478
01:37:07,220 --> 01:37:11,079
We can't go back in

479
01:37:11,079 --> 01:37:14,159
Unfortunate there's a hole in the ground

480
01:37:18,289 --> 01:37:22,710
Wait, wait, wait, wait, what? What? No, I think I don't think I can get back in

481
01:37:24,869 --> 01:37:28,770
Oh in the hole you jumped out of

482
01:37:29,250 --> 01:37:38,260
the hole I jumped out of is where the

483
01:37:38,260 --> 01:37:40,260
There's just a little cave with that pink guy

484
01:37:41,699 --> 01:37:44,260
Upgrade rooms are locked when you exit. Oh

485
01:37:44,979 --> 01:37:46,819
It's too bad

486
01:37:46,819 --> 01:37:52,500
That's too bad. I'm sorry. And I mean are we willing to sacrifice somebody? I don't know if i'm willing to sacrifice anybody

487
01:37:52,899 --> 01:37:57,840
Should we sacrifice the new green guy?

488
01:38:01,029 --> 01:38:03,720
But we just got gunu

489
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:05,800
Gunu doesn't deserve to die

490
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:12,039
Kill gunu

491
01:38:12,039 --> 01:38:12,920
What?

492
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:15,350

493
01:38:15,350 --> 01:38:18,710

496
01:38:40,069 --> 01:38:43,409
No gunu stays. I'm sorry

Trebum, i'm sorry

499
01:38:49,189 --> 01:38:53,250
I've made my decision

500
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:55,250
All right, we're gonna go this way left

501
01:38:56,210 --> 01:39:00,119

502
01:39:00,119 --> 01:39:04,630

509
01:40:14,770 --> 01:40:21,010

Okay, we have to we get we're moving and we are not we're not looking at anything

513
01:40:29,329 --> 01:40:32,609
I'm not gonna look at how scary that is and that i'm just crossing the path right now

514
01:40:33,489 --> 01:40:35,909
Get away from puke

515
01:40:35,909 --> 01:40:38,529
Everything is okay

516
01:40:38,529 --> 01:40:41,279
Here comes the wall

517
01:40:41,279 --> 01:40:43,720
Everyone is chasing us

518
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:47,960
Okay

519
01:40:47,960 --> 01:41:05,439
Everybody's still intact. Yep. We're gonna be really hungry after this get out of there get out of there. I got you. Don't worry

520
01:41:10,439 --> 01:41:11,479
Oh

521
01:41:11,479 --> 01:41:14,439
What do I do? It is a car. It's a car

522
01:41:15,159 --> 01:41:20,600
Is it gonna wake up? I don't want to fucking be here to find out

523
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:29,060
Don't wake up was this strange being

524
01:41:29,779 --> 01:41:31,779
Half flesh half metal

525
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:38,470
The trebum felt an old distant horror as if they remembered their own destruction

526
01:41:40,069 --> 01:41:42,310
Something about this creature was very

527
01:41:43,109 --> 01:41:44,229
very

528
01:41:44,229 --> 01:41:46,229
Wrong, so don't wake it up

529
01:41:46,630 --> 01:41:51,760
The hand behind the car that is weird

530
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:56,149
I don't think we want to wake this

531
01:41:57,029 --> 01:42:02,079
I'm not going to

532
01:42:02,079 --> 01:42:04,720
Oh, it's it's the influence of the three fingers

533
01:42:06,789 --> 01:42:09,670
Perhaps the creature would wake up with a loud noise

534
01:42:10,390 --> 01:42:13,350
If we want that to happen, I don't really want to do that

535
01:42:16,039 --> 01:42:20,260
I need oh wait. What is this?

536
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:22,979
There's a hole behind it, but just let me what is this?

537
01:42:25,989 --> 01:42:49,000
I pull the plug here. Can we pick this up or something? I don't know you need to eat something. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep

538
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:01,439
But anyways, uh, thanks for the ray conor. Hope you're doing good

539
01:43:03,250 --> 01:43:05,460
Yeah, we're just chilling out

540
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:09,090
Just hanging out

541
01:43:09,090 --> 01:43:10,850
Who told you to do that?

542
01:43:10,850 --> 01:43:12,689
Who did that?

543
01:43:12,689 --> 01:43:16,050
Who told you to do that? It's awake now. We need to eat first. What are you thinking?

544
01:43:17,319 --> 01:43:19,319
Why would you blow the horn? Who did that?

545
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:25,399
Trapped on all sides by deep pools of poisonous gas

546
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:29,020
The trebum needed to find a way to escape this monstrosity

547
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:33,000
I didn't want that to happen to use the creature's own weight

548
01:43:33,479 --> 01:43:36,159
to lower the bridge

549
01:43:36,239 --> 01:43:38,239
Okay, first of all

550
01:43:38,319 --> 01:43:40,720
So you need to run over here and

551
01:43:42,310 --> 01:43:48,199
and smash into this

552
01:43:48,199 --> 01:43:50,920
It was gunu. He betrayed you. What's wrong with us?

553
01:43:51,479 --> 01:43:55,800
What what's wrong with us? What's wrong? What's happening? What's wrong with us?

554
01:43:59,250 --> 01:44:00,289
No

555
01:44:00,289 --> 01:44:06,770
I did it guys. I can't look behind me restart restart restart restart. Everyone's gonna fucking die down here restart restart

556
01:44:06,850 --> 01:44:11,250
No, everyone's like coughing and choking. How do we get out? How do we get out of here? How do we get out of here?

557
01:44:21,569 --> 01:44:23,569
What the fuck? It's so hard

558
01:44:27,409 --> 01:44:30,850
God dang gunu. God damn it gunu. We were not ready

559
01:44:31,329 --> 01:44:33,010
Gunu we weren't ready

560
01:44:33,010 --> 01:44:37,430
You just wiped out the entire fucking family gunu

561
01:44:47,539 --> 01:44:50,579
You blew the why would you blow the horn? I wasn't prepared

562
01:44:56,149 --> 01:44:58,689
Okay

563
01:44:58,689 --> 01:45:02,720
Ban gunu from the guild

564
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:07,119
All right. So the idea is we have to wake up the month. Wait, not yet

565
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:14,130
Let me eat first

566
01:45:14,130 --> 01:45:16,130
Do not blow your horn

567
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:48,239
Just wait get out of here. Just trying to get it full stomach. All right, uh, I want the water

568
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:50,319
I want you to produce water

569
01:45:50,319 --> 01:45:53,039
Take a bunch of junk

570
01:45:53,039 --> 01:46:05,539
Okay gunu fight back. Wait, it wasn't gunu

571
01:46:06,100 --> 01:46:09,539
Gunu doesn't have a horn

572
01:46:09,539 --> 01:46:10,819
It was vu

573
01:46:10,819 --> 01:46:14,949
It was this dumbass

574
01:46:14,949 --> 01:46:17,380
Okay. Well, whatever

575
01:46:17,380 --> 01:46:21,029
So the strategy here is you gotta wake up this thing

576
01:46:21,750 --> 01:46:23,750
And have it run over here

577
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:26,239
That's I guess what i'm gonna do and let's try it

578
01:46:41,159 --> 01:46:43,159
Won't wake up from this. Why not?

579
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,319
Go go go go

580
01:46:46,319 --> 01:46:57,720
Trapped on all sides by deep pools of poisonous gas

581
01:46:58,199 --> 01:47:01,960
The trebum needed to find a way to escape this monstrosity. Oh here

582
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:05,239
Perhaps there was a way to use the creature's own weight

583
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:07,800
To lower the bridge

584
01:47:08,630 --> 01:47:10,869
Oh fuck. All right. We got it. We got it. Go go go go go

585
01:47:14,420 --> 01:47:16,159
one by one

586
01:47:16,159 --> 01:47:20,560
The oh light cruelly burned away the trebum's ability stop

587
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:26,640
How do I stop this? The elder had warned them about the evil light of the cylinder's servants the light

588
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:29,840
Now they knew what kind of creature to avoid

589
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:35,199
Get out of the poison. We all did we make it safely?

590
01:47:38,340 --> 01:47:40,340
One two, three four. You guys all right?

591
01:47:40,819 --> 01:47:44,680
All right. Take a break

592
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:46,199
Hold on. We need to take a break

593
01:47:46,199 --> 01:47:51,119
So we don't have any more abilities

594
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:54,520
We don't have an attractive cube anymore

595
01:47:56,289 --> 01:47:59,039
Okay

596
01:47:59,039 --> 01:48:06,399
So we now we kind of start we start the process up again. All right ruin the run

597
01:48:07,479 --> 01:48:09,479
No sexy cube

598
01:48:10,819 --> 01:48:12,819
Attractive cube. All right

599
01:48:14,399 --> 01:48:17,479
How we doing we need

600
01:48:17,560 --> 01:48:18,760
Up here

601
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:23,140
There's still space to explore over here. So let's go ahead and just see what we have

602
01:48:25,329 --> 01:48:27,329
That weird car is no longer over here

603
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:37,720
just scanning the field

604
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:46,079
See what's here

605
01:48:46,079 --> 01:48:49,600
I wonder if you can eventually kill those things or fight back or attack or something

606
01:48:53,420 --> 01:49:04,949
Interesting. What's that behind you? We're good. I mean, yeah, there's that thing but

607
01:49:07,359 --> 01:49:13,960
We're getting out of here. What's this?

608
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:17,359
Revival shrine

609
01:49:17,359 --> 01:49:22,789
These special ruins scattered around the world allow you to store or revive fellow trebum

610
01:49:23,109 --> 01:49:26,359
Storing trebum can be useful if you reach the maximum party limit

611
01:49:26,680 --> 01:49:30,199
Who would like to call upon some of your trebum during a later stage of the adventure?

612
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:37,640
Reviving lost trebum comes at a cost. The cost is based on how many mutations the trebum had when it perished

613
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:41,189
Okay

614
01:49:41,189 --> 01:49:44,149
When the trebum stepped on the strange device

615
01:49:44,630 --> 01:49:49,750
Interesting ancient memory came back to them a memory of long ago

616
01:49:50,069 --> 01:49:56,739
Where the cities of their people still stood and the fight against the cylinder was not yet lost

617
01:49:57,380 --> 01:49:59,510
So we got those days

618
01:49:59,510 --> 01:50:03,670
A very smart trebum had found a way of cheating very smart trebum

619
01:50:04,149 --> 01:50:10,710
Of stealing stuff in the cloud to absorb and to reshape and being uploaded to amazon web service

620
01:50:10,789 --> 01:50:15,409
Revive their fallen friends or send others to a hidden place

621
01:50:16,239 --> 01:50:20,720
And it was also by this device that a link had been forged

622
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:25,859
They have so many g names opened to the voice that spoke within them

623
01:50:32,930 --> 01:50:34,930
Put gunu in the hole

624
01:50:37,270 --> 01:50:48,960
Should we all right gunu is in the cloud, but that's kind of unfair

625
01:50:50,199 --> 01:50:58,289
No, we don't want to store gunu. Everyone's safe

626
01:50:58,609 --> 01:51:06,800
I think the whole point of storing is if they have a certain mutation that you don't want to lose

627
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:24,039
But nobody has a mutation. We all got it all just kind of gripped away. That's cool. That's how that works

628
01:51:24,119 --> 01:51:27,140
All right, does that does that thing does it look like anything on the map?

629
01:51:29,439 --> 01:51:45,039
Well, not much further to get to whatever that is. I wonder if there's anything else store someone away and save the pink one

630
01:51:46,199 --> 01:51:52,819
I really hate to say this the pink one is gone pink one is over there far over there

631
01:51:53,300 --> 01:52:05,939
Very dead get some water. Oh, hold on. Wasn't somebody supposed to be finding the fish ones. Here we go

632
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:15,000
All right, who do we want to be? Uh the big uh, big fat one blue

633
01:52:17,170 --> 01:52:31,520
I'm not it's just storage. I think make gunu the fat one. Why it was blue before fine. We'll do okay gunu. Here you go

634
01:52:36,689 --> 01:52:58,159
All right, gunu now gunu is everybody's favorite character all these like omega lows lol lol. Ha ha ha

635
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:08,039
It's not like that. It's not even like that funny. It's just like he's just a little bigger

636
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:19,140
It's not like he's a blobfish now. All right. Oh speaking of oh, we're not generating water anymore. Okay

637
01:53:19,380 --> 01:53:46,520
Well, I think i'm ready to move. Yeah, I think so unless this is a hole over here. I think it's time to move

638
01:53:47,479 --> 01:53:55,189
Huge poison chasm over here. So I need to go this way that dude's built like a Hershey kiss

639
01:53:55,590 --> 01:54:14,630
Yeah, I see it. All right. I'm going for it. All right prepare. I need to go there. We ready

640
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:48,470
All right, everyone's had food. Everyone's had water. Oh, this one's moving a little faster. Nothing here. Good. All right

641
01:54:48,949 --> 01:55:26,239
Oh catch your breath. Oh, fuck. It's actually kind of close go hurry up. Oh, is it all right get in get in get in all of you

642
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:30,340
Oh, thank goodness. Okay

643
01:55:30,340 --> 01:55:31,460
Jesus

644
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:38,369
One two, three, four five

645
01:55:41,250 --> 01:55:42,609
What happened?

646
01:55:42,609 --> 01:55:48,210
What happened? What happened? What happened? Why did that happen? Why is still going cylinder roared with fury?

647
01:55:49,220 --> 01:55:51,960
The voice of their memories spoke with great urgency

648
01:55:52,739 --> 01:55:55,539
The trebum had to be very careful now

649
01:55:55,779 --> 01:56:01,220
Oh god, um would lash out of the land, but it would not let them run too far

650
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:07,720
To survive they would have to stay in the eye of the storm, huh?

651
01:56:09,270 --> 01:56:11,029
Where is that?

652
01:56:11,029 --> 01:56:20,770
Stay in the what does that mean? What's that? I don't know. I I don't understand what that's supposed to mean

653
01:56:31,750 --> 01:56:33,109
Stay close

654
01:56:33,109 --> 01:56:36,550
The torso is producing electrical barrier that you cannot pass out running lightning strikes. It's not possible

655
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:40,449
What do we do?

656
01:56:40,449 --> 01:56:42,449
You can't get far ahead of it. Wait, what?

657
01:56:43,170 --> 01:56:50,899
And we need to eat something

658
01:56:50,899 --> 01:56:52,739
Do I have to stay close?

659
01:56:52,739 --> 01:56:57,890
You have to be between the lightning and the cylinder

660
01:56:59,729 --> 01:57:02,630
Oh my goodness

661
01:57:02,630 --> 01:57:05,350
All right. Eat quick quick quick eat eat eat eat go go go

662
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:20,039
Not that close

663
01:57:20,039 --> 01:57:21,640
This is so much

664
01:57:21,640 --> 01:57:27,699
God

665
01:57:27,699 --> 01:57:29,699
All right. It's all right. Any more food

666
01:57:37,060 --> 01:57:40,760
Who is that thing? What is that? Let's find out

667
01:58:06,920 --> 01:58:08,119
plenty of water

668
01:58:08,119 --> 01:58:13,670
Everything's okay

669
01:58:13,670 --> 01:58:16,500
Uh

670
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:18,500
What is this? Can I do anything with this?

671
01:58:18,739 --> 01:58:21,489
I don't think so. I'm just checking

672
01:58:38,119 --> 01:58:43,159
This is so scary. They're not gonna eat us right? Not right now. That would be really really annoying

673
01:58:46,039 --> 01:58:48,199
Sacrifice gunu and run to the cylinder

674
01:58:48,920 --> 01:58:52,479
I wonder if this counts

675
01:58:52,479 --> 01:58:58,800
Is this gonna shatter?

676
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:09,029
What do we just eat?

677
01:59:09,029 --> 01:59:15,300
Lightning is lightning is striking me

678
01:59:15,779 --> 01:59:17,779
Gunu must survive

679
01:59:19,119 --> 01:59:20,609
Oh

680
01:59:20,609 --> 01:59:22,609
Back up back up back. Don't go too far

681
01:59:22,850 --> 01:59:32,899
I want one of these flowers so bad

682
01:59:35,090 --> 01:59:54,479
As frightening and surprising as this enormous creature was that trebum felt a sense of relief to see it descend

683
01:59:54,880 --> 02:00:00,470
From the sky what the holy shit a celestial being that'd been told to seek

684
02:00:01,619 --> 02:00:07,399
Perhaps it held an answer to their troubles. Oh poison

685
02:00:08,119 --> 02:00:13,829
Okay, I should give everybody one of these then. Yeah, let's all take these here

686
02:00:15,090 --> 02:00:33,569
Everybody grab one. Oh shit. I'm sorry. I'm trying to give you this

687
02:00:34,369 --> 02:00:44,420
I have to imagine everybody should have it

688
02:00:44,420 --> 02:01:07,060
Hopefully it doesn't uh overwrite what gunu has already so there how many people still need it. We have one two three

689
02:01:14,439 --> 02:01:16,439
I ain't fucking around anymore

690
02:01:20,470 --> 02:01:21,680
Elf

691
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:23,840
As they approached the colossal creature

692
02:01:24,399 --> 02:01:29,439
Their optimism faded why it did not seem to like them at all

693
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:33,760
What and now they realized what terrible danger they were in

694
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:39,760
If this creature guarded the way to some holy place, then that place must lie below it

695
02:01:40,899 --> 02:01:42,739
And being so large

696
02:01:42,739 --> 02:01:46,819
The creature most likely could not see what was in front of it. It just killed that motherfucker

697
02:01:46,899 --> 02:01:51,380
All right. Hold on. We need so perhaps the size of the trebum was an advantage after all

698
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:57,159
Perhaps okay, they could reach the platform right under the serpent's head

699
02:01:58,359 --> 02:02:02,279
Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, stop, stop, stop

700
02:02:06,149 --> 02:02:12,529
The trouhalla has an electric attack that strikes if you remain in its line of sight for too long. It had to be in cover

701
02:02:13,090 --> 02:02:16,739
All right. Everybody has to have the poison on

702
02:02:16,899 --> 02:02:18,420
It's just the way it works

703
02:02:18,420 --> 02:02:26,359
Come here gunu get out of line of sight who's in line of sight right now. Stop

704
02:02:39,319 --> 02:02:45,560
Get over here. We need food. I'm not going over there to have food everybody have um poison gas mask on

705
02:02:47,970 --> 02:02:50,229
Uh, you don't

706
02:02:50,229 --> 02:03:10,319
Grutemu, okay grutemu. There is an egg

707
02:03:13,319 --> 02:03:17,399
All right. We don't want that to happen to us. That was awful. So don't all right

708
02:03:18,420 --> 02:03:22,130
uh

709
02:03:22,130 --> 02:03:24,609
Shit

710
02:03:24,609 --> 02:03:26,609
There's an egg over here, but I don't

711
02:03:28,199 --> 02:03:30,199
Rotem need more leadership

712
02:03:32,319 --> 02:03:35,140
Fuck okay

713
02:03:35,939 --> 02:03:39,220
Move move move move move move out of the way out of the way out of the way out of the way

714
02:03:40,390 --> 02:03:47,170
Let it get zapped. Okay, good

715
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:49,000
um

716
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:57,920
Gunu, I want you to take point here. Everybody has to follow gunu. We need food. We need to eat. All right, follow me

717
02:04:00,319 --> 02:04:03,090
What happened?

718
02:04:03,090 --> 02:04:12,390
Fuck. Okay. Hold on. This is something. What is this? Who wants it?

719
02:04:14,529 --> 02:04:16,529
one two three four

720
02:04:16,609 --> 02:04:19,920
Five

721
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:21,359
All right, you eat this

722
02:04:21,359 --> 02:04:38,289
We gotta figure we need to eat we figure out this is electricity. Um, something about like, I don't know eat it legless

723
02:04:41,279 --> 02:04:42,239
um

724
02:04:42,239 --> 02:04:47,880
Well, this one dies

725
02:04:49,250 --> 02:04:51,250
No

726
02:04:51,329 --> 02:04:56,500
It's okay. It's all right. We will always remember you we will always

727
02:04:57,560 --> 02:05:02,560
Remember all the jokes you told us. We'll always remember you. Um

728
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:06,039
it's been real

729
02:05:06,039 --> 02:05:09,640
you're super nice and we all love you and

730
02:05:13,619 --> 02:05:18,550
Make it one two. Where are they? Where are they?

731
02:05:22,289 --> 02:05:31,699
One two, three, four five. Wait, they grew back

732
02:05:32,260 --> 02:05:43,970
No, we're all here. Wait, it was you. Is it maybe it's a temporary thing. What are you doing?

733
02:05:45,880 --> 02:05:46,840
Ah

734
02:05:46,840 --> 02:05:50,850
Why is it targeting him?

735
02:05:50,850 --> 02:05:57,000
All right. Everybody relax. I need to have a game. Why is it targeting him? We need to eat now

736
02:05:58,149 --> 02:06:00,789
All right, you go get it. You're the one that's being targeted for no reason

737
02:06:02,069 --> 02:06:12,119
You gotta collect the food

738
02:06:12,279 --> 02:06:23,140
Gunu go for it

739
02:06:35,670 --> 02:06:37,399
Okay, oh

740
02:06:37,399 --> 02:06:50,869
We need water now. Where the hell are we gonna get water? Everybody can let's all right

741
02:06:51,109 --> 02:06:58,199
We gotta go we have to go for it hide in the poison. I believe we can't get whoever's in that egg

742
02:06:58,279 --> 02:07:00,279
It's just not possible. It's not gonna happen

743
02:07:01,140 --> 02:07:01,939
um

744
02:07:01,939 --> 02:07:03,300
Let's go down

745
02:07:03,300 --> 02:07:26,229
Everybody should be safe down here. Okay, we need water bad

746
02:07:26,789 --> 02:07:44,199
Can we go in this you can't find other trouble return to the platform from time to time other wandering friends

747
02:07:44,760 --> 02:07:46,760
Might have reached it on their own

748
02:07:47,779 --> 02:08:10,979
What does that mean what's the egg relieved at having bested the guardian?

749
02:08:11,060 --> 02:08:15,220
I have a full party trebum now found themselves seeking the help they had been promised

750
02:08:16,319 --> 02:08:19,279
Who would answer their questions in this place?

751
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:23,539
You ate the egg

752
02:08:23,539 --> 02:08:29,060
Well, yeah, I mean it's I I I have a full party though. I have six um trebums one two, three four five

753
02:08:29,140 --> 02:08:33,460
So yeah, I can't get any more even if even if I got that egg and hatched it. I couldn't

754
02:08:34,770 --> 02:08:47,350
You're not gonna die from that right? Okay. What is that? What just happened?

755
02:08:49,359 --> 02:08:56,079
Uh, i'm going down the magic crystals

756
02:08:59,439 --> 02:09:01,439
interesting

757
02:09:03,600 --> 02:09:05,600
Interesting what does this do?

758
02:09:07,300 --> 02:09:24,050
You try it light. Oh you turn them into a torch

759
02:09:25,619 --> 02:09:30,359
Okay, that's funny. I think we should only have one person do that

760
02:09:32,479 --> 02:10:08,770
I don't think we should have more than one starlight. We're pretty good on food. I love this area. It's very uh,

761
02:10:09,090 --> 02:10:22,340
What does it remind me of? It's like fraggle rock. This was what was this one again?

762
02:10:24,069 --> 02:10:28,069
Oh, don't die. Yeah, don't take this. This is the you just like lose. This is like you don't have legs

763
02:10:28,069 --> 02:10:46,850
All right. Yeah, I don't want that. Everybody got full water. Look at this one. We need more spots

764
02:10:47,170 --> 02:11:03,810
All right, who's gonna get drowned? Save him. I can't I have a full party. What do you mean? What the fuck?

765
02:11:03,810 --> 02:11:17,489
What the fuck what you need to put them in storage? All right, we are going to put the the

766
02:11:18,289 --> 02:11:20,289
Lamp we're gonna put the lamp

767
02:11:20,449 --> 02:11:23,010
Into storage because we're not gonna need the lamp anymore

768
02:11:23,250 --> 02:11:32,390
Brutemu the lamp and anytime we need a light we will pull Brutemu out of storage

769
02:11:32,630 --> 02:12:06,630
That's definitely what you're supposed to be doing. Wait, there's a lamp. We need to you. Okay, you gotta be the front anything else

770
02:12:09,619 --> 02:12:10,579
Oh

771
02:12:10,579 --> 02:12:21,380
Look up there. Can I make the jump when you have legs? You have legs you ate that weird shit just up here too

772
02:12:21,619 --> 02:12:35,569
Do you have to have the specific? Oh, this is huge. Actually. Gunu is useless. Gunu is a backpack

773
02:12:36,449 --> 02:12:52,149
They're definitely not useless. All right, what's in here? That looks whatever it is. It looks delicious. Oh, no

774
02:12:52,470 --> 02:12:59,989
There you are over here, please. I got a few things for you to store

775
02:13:07,520 --> 02:13:16,319
This I think is a full heel you can just open the inventory. That's true

776
02:13:16,640 --> 02:13:30,239
So this is a full heel full water full food. What is this? Should Gunu eat the light?

777
02:13:30,319 --> 02:13:37,109
I wonder will it is it will it take over his bigness or will it just be a will he just glow in the dark?

778
02:13:37,350 --> 02:13:43,920
I feel like this one should be the lamp the biggest character

779
02:13:44,159 --> 02:14:05,960
Okay, I actually like i'm not that happy about this because Gunu now is gonna look like this until he doesn't

780
02:14:10,930 --> 02:14:21,060
Well, we got what we wanted and let's go even with the light the maze was difficult to traverse

781
02:14:22,119 --> 02:14:25,720
Was there some clue in the structures on the walls?

782
02:14:26,039 --> 02:14:33,779
I think was the part of sand on the ground meant to help them perhaps others had walked in this place long ago

783
02:14:34,579 --> 02:14:38,500
And tried to leave a path for those who would one day follow them

784
02:14:39,060 --> 02:14:50,479
This is an arrow, right? I mean these are arrows. They put arrows. They're very smart something here

785
02:14:57,270 --> 02:15:08,720
I want more people to be able to jump. Let's get out of here. How we doing on food good

786
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:23,409
Yeah, how do we get out of here? This is where we came in

787
02:15:23,649 --> 02:15:32,399
So why did it was like oh traverse make sure you know the correct way all the large arrows on the way

788
02:15:32,399 --> 02:15:59,989
Didn't I do that? Oh, I didn't how did I follow them the wrong way something I can do. Yeah, follow the large arrows

789
02:16:00,069 --> 02:16:30,449
This is a snail. What significance do the snails have? These are big chunky rocks. I break them. I can't all right

790
02:16:30,529 --> 02:16:42,129
So that's interesting. What's with the slug? We don't have a cube

791
02:16:42,610 --> 02:17:13,840
Unfortunately, maybe we'll get a cube in a minute here you get out of here. This is our territory somebody kill them

792
02:17:24,450 --> 02:17:28,520
Well definitely wants us to have a jump power. I have a couple people that already have it

793
02:17:33,600 --> 02:17:42,659
Uh, I guess i'll give it to more of you probably have it dude. It's so dark

794
02:17:43,459 --> 02:18:10,020
Where is it? Oh, it's over here. I eat this get some legs. Can I give the legs to gunu?

795
02:18:12,200 --> 02:18:18,819
I feel like it's gonna override. It's probably gonna override the um

796
02:18:19,809 --> 02:18:27,540
Bigness I think it's legs not body

797
02:18:38,120 --> 02:18:44,790
Save and try it. Well, it's worth a shot. Let's see if it is just like legs

798
02:18:45,270 --> 02:18:47,889
Maybe it doesn't replace anything

799
02:18:47,889 --> 02:19:12,920
That's not what I want. No, stop. Let me do this. Okay, so it is it's legs body

800
02:19:13,639 --> 02:19:23,299
Skin and nose. I think of the different ones. Okay, cool. None of these

801
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:48,129
What was this one? I forget what this one does zero for me to see amber. Oh, it's the third eye

802
02:19:48,450 --> 02:19:53,780
Give it to gunu. Do you want gunu just to be completely stacked?

803
02:19:54,100 --> 02:20:18,120
Okay, if gunu dies, it's a problem like actually a problem. I think that's good

804
02:20:18,600 --> 02:20:47,829
He just gets uglier and uglier. Hey, don't say that how dare you fill up on water

805
02:20:48,069 --> 02:20:53,700
Yeah, so the reason why why cube didn't work is it's changed his body

806
02:20:53,940 --> 02:20:59,700
So we gotta keep that in mind. I'm going to forget every single one of these. So please help

807
02:21:02,370 --> 02:21:45,079
I think we should have a swimmer you swim. There we go crystals. I got a lot of these

808
02:21:45,079 --> 02:21:56,870
I need to spend them. Should everybody just glow in the dark temporarily. They're not dying. Are they wait?

809
02:21:56,870 --> 02:22:16,040
What's going on? Are they okay? I need light. I think it's all right. I'm gonna make a couple more people

810
02:22:24,719 --> 02:22:39,319
They can't jump that eventually I can teleport them. I just can't see there we go. Everybody should be there

811
02:22:39,319 --> 02:23:03,219
They are okay crystals. All right that way. Well, hold on. What's this? Oh, it's cube. It's a cube

812
02:23:03,299 --> 02:23:37,989
All right, who should be a cube you boo. You're the cube now gunu can't be a cube. Okay. All right somebody else's

813
02:23:38,389 --> 02:23:44,530
Uh, you're the biggest one. So just go now. That is not an attractive cube. It's just a cube

814
02:23:45,989 --> 02:23:54,680
It was a place where somebody could go. I wonder if i'm gonna wrap around now. Yeah, okay

815
02:23:54,840 --> 02:24:00,200
They're cool. Oh, it's a place where you could go

816
02:24:00,760 --> 02:24:29,920
Where was it? Yes. All right cube get in there. Whoa

817
02:24:30,479 --> 02:24:32,840
Okay

818
02:24:32,840 --> 02:24:35,649
a moa

819
02:24:35,649 --> 02:24:52,370
Ball now what encountering another elder was a happy moment the trebum asked how they might survive the cylinder and the elder replied

820
02:24:53,030 --> 02:24:57,940
I can feel your fear little one ever since this cataclysm began

821
02:24:57,940 --> 02:25:03,899
We have been seeking ways to stop it, but the cylinder is relentless and indestructible

822
02:25:05,239 --> 02:25:07,719
It will consume everything in its path

823
02:25:08,520 --> 02:25:13,479
So perhaps what we need to do is go behind it

824
02:25:14,280 --> 02:25:18,280
I have discovered a mutation that allows us to rise into the sky

825
02:25:19,190 --> 02:25:25,030
You must seek a weeping tree from which grows a special fruit that floats as it becomes ripe

826
02:25:25,969 --> 02:25:30,309
It is the key to the transformation I have undergone with it

827
02:25:30,879 --> 02:25:34,159
You can use geysers to float well above the cylinder's height

828
02:25:34,950 --> 02:25:40,069
My only regret is that I have grown too old and weak to help you with this task

829
02:25:41,030 --> 02:25:46,069
If you find any glimmer of hope on the other side, remember me

830
02:25:47,350 --> 02:25:51,940
farewell

831
02:25:52,020 --> 02:26:07,540
All right, so there's a I have to eat a special food. Now. The question is is it on the map? No, it's a special tree

832
02:26:08,180 --> 02:26:35,079
Get us to float can we use this thing? Wait, somebody's dead who died?

833
02:26:35,639 --> 02:26:40,290
Somebody's dead

834
02:26:40,370 --> 02:26:51,030
This is hurting us

835
02:26:51,030 --> 02:27:05,399
No, guna's not dead. He didn't just die somewhere. No way. Where's everybody?

836
02:27:08,760 --> 02:27:27,680
Show gunu on cam. Hold on. All right. Yeah, what the fuck is everybody this guna?

837
02:27:30,600 --> 02:27:34,930
Um, what are we doing? I can't float through that

838
02:27:35,569 --> 02:27:43,700
But I found this tree. Well, where's it? We can't go up that way

839
02:27:45,700 --> 02:27:52,360
As we just go out this way

840
02:27:54,979 --> 02:27:59,299
Sadness and fear filled the trebum's hearts as they left the elder's cave

841
02:27:59,620 --> 02:28:03,959
Stand by their only path to salvation was full of uncertainty

842
02:28:04,579 --> 02:28:07,219
I know I could go out the door. I just didn't know what someone wanted to get here

843
02:28:07,459 --> 02:28:13,940
They had seen lurking behind the cylinder casting a dark shadow over this glimpse of light

844
02:28:16,739 --> 02:28:26,790
Okay, so just a big log rolling

845
02:28:30,659 --> 02:28:35,700
Interesting the trebum had never seen this mysterious tree the elder spoke of

846
02:28:37,569 --> 02:28:41,809
They would have to keep moving forward and hope it lay somewhere ahead

847
02:28:42,610 --> 02:28:45,489
The cylinder would give them no other choice

848
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:52,040
all right, let's get

849
02:28:52,040 --> 02:28:53,399
and the

850
02:28:53,399 --> 02:28:56,280
Big dragon is gone. So that's a plus

851
02:28:58,799 --> 02:29:03,120
Everyone just coming to the stream right now. What would it mean big dragon? What the fuck? What are you? Yeah, man

852
02:29:03,840 --> 02:29:10,559
Should have saw it and I actually might sound like i'm being sarcastic, but it actually was really cool

853
02:29:12,420 --> 02:29:25,860
Okay, there's some what is this it's pointing over here. So there's that way

854
02:29:26,420 --> 02:29:47,200
It's pointing over here though. Still good on food. Maybe somebody should be

855
02:29:47,819 --> 02:29:49,120
tanky

856
02:29:49,120 --> 02:29:51,489
Yeah

857
02:29:51,489 --> 02:29:52,739
you

858
02:29:52,739 --> 02:30:05,010
Wait, oh wait, I forgot. That's not the right one

859
02:30:05,729 --> 02:30:08,450
Well, it's okay

860
02:30:08,450 --> 02:30:10,450
You just make water

861
02:30:10,690 --> 02:30:23,030
Is this food?

862
02:30:23,030 --> 02:30:26,100
I wonder can I eat anything up this?

863
02:30:27,040 --> 02:30:32,799
No

864
02:30:32,799 --> 02:30:34,879
So correct me if i'm wrong

865
02:30:34,879 --> 02:30:36,610
and

866
02:30:36,610 --> 02:30:38,610
This I think this is accurate

867
02:30:38,930 --> 02:30:43,489
This is made by the same team that did xeno clash. Do you remember xeno clash?

868
02:30:44,290 --> 02:30:50,549
Do you remember that game?

869
02:30:50,549 --> 02:30:52,549
That game was wild

870
02:30:53,760 --> 02:30:58,559
They're actually making another xeno clash game. Aren't they coming out soon? I think

871
02:30:59,379 --> 02:31:01,200
but same team

872
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:02,159
it

873
02:31:02,159 --> 02:31:03,600
I mean that would

874
02:31:03,600 --> 02:31:06,879
I mean all the character designs it looks very much like xeno clash

875
02:31:10,319 --> 02:31:17,200
Whoever is there whoever is doing the character designs and the concept work for uh ace team where the xeno clash team

876
02:31:20,229 --> 02:31:23,510
It's it's like next level. They're they're they're unbelievably good

877
02:31:25,729 --> 02:31:29,889
Um, all right, i'm gonna go touch that wait didn't I already see this? Am I crazy?

878
02:31:30,610 --> 02:31:35,479
The new xeno game looks actually really cool

879
02:31:35,799 --> 02:31:37,799
Yeah, it's like a dice game

880
02:31:37,879 --> 02:31:43,159
But then it turns into sort of like a third person action game after you play a game of dice or something

881
02:31:43,879 --> 02:31:45,879
I'll probably play it. It looks really interesting

882
02:31:46,200 --> 02:31:51,120
Did I touch this already?

883
02:31:51,120 --> 02:31:53,600
Oh, yes, we're gonna store people right right right right

884
02:31:54,629 --> 02:31:56,719
All right

885
02:31:56,719 --> 02:31:59,000
We are gonna store

886
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:00,360
one of our

887
02:32:00,360 --> 02:32:02,360
Yeah, we need to we're gonna store a lamp

888
02:32:04,340 --> 02:32:06,340
Who do we want? Yeah, we're gonna store

889
02:32:08,840 --> 02:32:12,049
Store gru temu

890
02:32:12,049 --> 02:32:26,760
Makes sense. All right gru temu you're getting stored in case we need a lamp who knew it stays

891
02:32:28,440 --> 02:32:37,319
Gua stays boo stays wog will stays. There he goes. Okay, so we have

892
02:32:37,799 --> 02:32:42,260
It was kind of everyone kind of has a purpose at this point

893
02:32:49,010 --> 02:32:58,600
One two, three or five. Okay, that wasn't the lamp. Yeah, it was who knew is the most important

894
02:32:58,680 --> 02:33:12,629
But yeah, the most important one has to stick around two. We need two lamps in there. Ah

895
02:33:13,590 --> 02:33:17,510
Get out. Well, that's you should be safe. You shouldn't be able to get over here

896
02:33:21,079 --> 02:33:29,809
Get out of here. We're okay. We're in trouble something else is moving over here now. Oh my goodness

897
02:33:29,809 --> 02:33:31,889
All right. No, no, go go go just get out get out get out get out

898
02:33:32,840 --> 02:33:56,559
We stored one. We gotta go. We gotta go. We gotta go right now. I'm going now plenty of health

899
02:33:57,909 --> 02:34:00,659
Find this tree

900
02:34:00,659 --> 02:34:01,780
Oh

901
02:34:01,780 --> 02:34:04,500
Shit. Oh shit. Oh shit

902
02:34:05,680 --> 02:34:06,959
big problem

903
02:34:06,959 --> 02:34:08,959
Somebody can swim can't they who can swim?

904
02:34:09,780 --> 02:34:12,899
Who can swim one of you swims who swims? Who's the swimmer?

905
02:34:14,280 --> 02:34:15,799
Who swims?

906
02:34:15,799 --> 02:34:17,559
Somebody swims, right?

907
02:34:17,559 --> 02:34:18,840
Who swims?

908
02:34:18,840 --> 02:34:20,819
Nobody swims

909
02:34:20,819 --> 02:34:23,299
Nobody swims. I stored the swimmer. We're dead

910
02:34:32,290 --> 02:34:34,290
I stored the swimmer

911
02:34:39,079 --> 02:34:45,000
Okay, well done. Was he there? I don't think so

912
02:34:48,399 --> 02:34:54,280
Oh fuck off

913
02:34:54,280 --> 02:34:56,280
We told you to store the lamp

914
02:34:57,700 --> 02:35:03,569
Okay, you're going in there and i'm bringing out the swimmer. What's your name?

915
02:35:06,069 --> 02:35:15,840
Woog wool. All right, woog wool go in there and we'll pull the swimmer out. The thing is gonna kill all of us

916
02:35:18,709 --> 02:35:23,379
Okay, woog wool going in

917
02:35:23,379 --> 02:35:45,299
Grutemu coming out. Where's the swimmer? One, two, three. Wait

918
02:35:49,379 --> 02:35:52,659
Wrong. I don't hold on a second. Who has the swimming ability?

919
02:35:54,850 --> 02:35:57,989
It's kind of it's hard to tell

920
02:35:57,989 --> 02:36:20,079
Does woog wool have swimming? I wish I could see their traits right here. None have the swimming. You lost it

921
02:36:20,319 --> 02:36:28,319
How did I lose it? Didn't somebody just get it? Somebody had webbed feet, right? It is woog wool. Okay

922
02:36:31,649 --> 02:36:34,530
All right. So then grutemu goes in as grutemu is just

923
02:36:35,719 --> 02:36:38,760
Literally just glowing and jump. Okay, put grutemu in

924
02:36:39,319 --> 02:36:52,420
Yeah, we did. We had it right the first time. Yeah, I just freaked out because I didn't realize that you had the webbed feet

925
02:36:52,500 --> 02:36:58,389
All right. Let's go. All right, woog wool. Where are you? You know, you know, you know what threw me off

926
02:36:59,190 --> 02:37:01,190
It was the fact that um

927
02:37:01,510 --> 02:37:03,110
Woog wool is glowing

928
02:37:03,110 --> 02:37:11,520
Okay, I need to take a look at the map

929
02:37:11,520 --> 02:37:15,319
Oh fuck

930
02:37:15,319 --> 02:37:18,040
We okay everyone. Okay. All right. I need to look at the map

931
02:37:21,889 --> 02:37:23,889
I think I can just swim across this

932
02:37:24,290 --> 02:37:27,840
with woog wool

933
02:37:27,840 --> 02:37:34,559
I think woog wool can make it

934
02:37:34,559 --> 02:37:37,750
Oh

935
02:37:37,750 --> 02:37:39,110
Get away

936
02:37:39,110 --> 02:37:50,899
Okay, it's moving. All right. Well, you need to eat and then you swim in over there

937
02:37:51,620 --> 02:38:03,639
Come on use your trait

938
02:38:03,719 --> 02:38:04,760
Yes

939
02:38:04,760 --> 02:38:10,520
I think it's gonna work. Don't even look back

940
02:38:47,090 --> 02:38:49,520
Okay, so we're gonna go the long way

941
02:38:50,239 --> 02:38:52,239
There's not there's not enough stamina

942
02:38:54,979 --> 02:38:57,540
I need to upgrade my stamina to try something like that again

943
02:38:58,180 --> 02:39:05,090
So I gotta go around the water. Okay, this game is cool. I like this game. It's fun

944
02:39:06,629 --> 02:39:07,909
well

945
02:39:07,909 --> 02:39:09,909
Who you're gonna spawn me right here?

946
02:39:11,350 --> 02:39:17,110
Don't luigi me. I'm still learning do not luigi me, please. I'm not gonna hear that right now

947
02:39:18,120 --> 02:39:28,000
But hold on will you get out of here?

948
02:39:28,799 --> 02:39:30,799
Seriously get out of here

949
02:39:30,879 --> 02:39:38,719
We just gotta move. Oh my god, just go

950
02:39:39,680 --> 02:39:47,479
Where's the okay, where's the water water? I just gotta go straight wrap around I need food

951
02:39:48,360 --> 02:39:54,440
just go

952
02:39:54,440 --> 02:39:56,760
Pick the worst possible way to go man

953
02:40:34,920 --> 02:40:39,239
No, I don't think I can do it. I don't think I can do it

954
02:40:41,120 --> 02:40:51,000
I'm not I don't think i'm gonna make it. I don't think I have enough stamina to make it the whole way

955
02:40:52,309 --> 02:40:59,030
Maybe I do

956
02:40:59,030 --> 02:41:02,799
Uh

957
02:41:07,920 --> 02:41:19,159
Yes, okay I got it we're good everything's fine already relaxed now we need to eat

958
02:41:23,600 --> 02:41:27,440
They were still nowhere near the mysterious tree that we're supposed to find

959
02:41:28,420 --> 02:41:30,659
But the voice and their memories encouraged them

960
02:41:31,319 --> 02:41:36,520
It was wise and matters of root and rock and it could sense the soil under their feet

961
02:41:36,979 --> 02:41:39,639
Changing oh no step by step

962
02:41:40,520 --> 02:41:43,340
They were getting closer the thing looks dangerous

963
02:41:45,989 --> 02:41:47,989
You got food reserves, don't you?

964
02:41:49,459 --> 02:41:51,600
You ate it

965
02:41:51,600 --> 02:41:55,200
You ate it. Why did you eat it? We weren't I didn't want you to eat that

966
02:41:55,840 --> 02:42:20,389
I mean, I it was a good thing, but that's for emergencies. Don't eat that. Okay, let's keep going couple points of interest over here

967
02:42:21,649 --> 02:42:29,090
But wait

968
02:42:29,090 --> 02:42:31,409
Oh

969
02:42:31,409 --> 02:42:51,360
No, do that again. It doesn't work. All right. I think he's he does it eventually we just have to get back and

970
02:42:52,819 --> 02:43:01,719
Once he's not okay, the snow gets out for a certain reason. I don't know why

971
02:43:02,280 --> 02:43:19,329
So should we give the uh attractive power up to gunu or keep the glow keep it low

972
02:43:19,489 --> 02:44:06,239
I wonder how it works cool. I kind of miss the uh, the lighting it gives though. All right, so

973
02:44:08,360 --> 02:44:18,920
Over here. I wonder why you would need to be

974
02:44:19,719 --> 02:44:35,090
Uh attractive right? I wonder if there's something that ends up happening later or something. I don't know what it would be point of interest

975
02:44:36,549 --> 02:44:57,600
Oh who's in here? I need I need somebody that can fight who's in here

976
02:44:58,479 --> 02:45:12,200
Go vu you need a mushroom and you need four mushrooms and three crystals. What's up?

977
02:45:14,340 --> 02:45:23,459
Go vu we got go vu. Ooh, I like go vu orange

978
02:45:29,200 --> 02:45:39,600
It's a bunch of weirdos. All right, we gotta go

979
02:45:45,200 --> 02:45:48,000
Uh back to that point of interest. Okay, it's like a temple

980
02:45:55,350 --> 02:45:58,209
Get in get

981
02:45:58,209 --> 02:46:00,209
Uh

982
02:46:02,579 --> 02:46:05,059
No, so he died what who died

983
02:46:05,780 --> 02:46:08,899
Who died somebody got spit on and died. Who was it?

984
02:46:09,520 --> 02:46:10,659
guru

985
02:46:10,659 --> 02:46:12,790
Where's guru?

986
02:46:12,790 --> 02:46:14,469
Which one was guru?

987
02:46:14,469 --> 02:46:20,850
Can we just no do not the one we just got?

988
02:46:23,120 --> 02:46:31,649
Oh, okay. You're fine. It was guru guru is gone. I don't even remember who the fuck that was if i'm honest

989
02:46:32,049 --> 02:46:35,510
so

990
02:46:36,469 --> 02:46:43,959
Who was guru?

991
02:46:43,959 --> 02:46:51,110
All right. I need to make a decision here was guru the purple

992
02:46:55,760 --> 02:46:59,590
Max hell hold on

993
02:46:59,590 --> 02:47:02,229
He doesn't even care. No, I just don't remember

994
02:47:02,870 --> 02:47:05,520
Okay, I remember

995
02:47:05,520 --> 02:47:06,959
the guru

996
02:47:06,959 --> 02:47:10,389
shining cube is vu right? You're the cube

997
02:47:11,909 --> 02:47:15,909
glow, uh, I remember the glow one is wu wu with the webbed feet

998
02:47:16,709 --> 02:47:17,989
the new one

999
02:47:17,989 --> 02:47:20,770
go vu is the orange one and then

1000
02:47:21,569 --> 02:47:31,190
Gui is the one with the big head. I don't remember the other one. Sorry that they got um

1001
02:47:32,709 --> 02:47:35,510
Like obliterated. I don't even know what to say

1002
02:47:44,790 --> 02:47:48,049
All right. We definitely need uh leadership

1003
02:47:48,049 --> 02:48:04,420
So this is maximum number of trebum. I definitely want it. I think that lets us have seven. I wonder what else

1004
02:48:13,010 --> 02:48:15,280
Probably do it twice

1005
02:48:15,280 --> 02:48:18,639
Water storage. This is probably this is important and stamina

1006
02:48:19,280 --> 02:48:20,870
I do both

1007
02:48:20,870 --> 02:48:32,069
food storage

1008
02:48:32,069 --> 02:48:38,260
food storage and stamina or water supply and stamina or

1009
02:48:39,280 --> 02:48:45,569
Stamina and another party member. Is this game multiplayer? I don't think so

1010
02:48:46,209 --> 02:48:48,610
I think it's just like a little single player campaign

1011
02:48:56,739 --> 02:48:59,719
Food and stamina stamina and leadership again

1012
02:49:01,200 --> 02:49:06,000
Um, well, I know i'm doing stamina. So where is it? It's over here somewhere, right? What about health?

1013
02:49:07,729 --> 02:49:18,149
I mean that one of our best friends got just annihilated in a second. That's expensive

1014
02:49:19,170 --> 02:49:25,670
Stamina do I even have enough to do anything? I could do stamina health. I have 7.5. So

1015
02:49:26,389 --> 02:49:29,840
Food capacity is probably water and food capacity is important. I think

1016
02:49:32,920 --> 02:49:48,500
Or I could just do another one food is important food's important

1017
02:49:52,200 --> 02:50:01,780
So I got food stamina

1018
02:50:01,780 --> 02:50:13,200
And that's it. You can yeah, I I can you can revive it probably costs money though

1019
02:50:13,440 --> 02:50:18,719
I don't know if i'm gonna do that yet. I'm afraid i'm gonna open this door and there's gonna be the things are gonna be here

1020
02:50:32,549 --> 02:50:38,559
Yep out out out

1021
02:50:45,649 --> 02:50:48,309
Mmm

1022
02:50:48,309 --> 02:50:50,479
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Are we safe?

1023
02:50:51,670 --> 02:50:59,559
One two, three, four five. It just hit me. I'm gonna cry. We lost we lost

1024
02:51:00,260 --> 02:51:10,340
Guogui it's hitting me right now. I'm actually sad. It just hit me right now. So awful

1025
02:51:12,799 --> 02:51:14,799
That's not his name

1026
02:51:19,159 --> 02:51:21,799
That is the equivalent of like if your son's name was like

1027
02:51:22,440 --> 02:51:29,139
David and it's like, oh no you something. No, we lost. What? Wait, wait, where's uh

1028
02:51:30,360 --> 02:51:32,360
Dread

1029
02:51:34,930 --> 02:51:37,329
Like you don't have your own fucking kid's name

1030
02:51:38,899 --> 02:51:40,659
Hey, honey. Do you have any idea where

1031
02:51:42,500 --> 02:51:51,620
Is

1032
02:51:51,620 --> 02:52:01,280
A new friend you want three mushrooms and three crystals. I don't have enough. There's an egg thing here though

1033
02:52:09,510 --> 02:52:17,520
Why are you so poor? I just spent like a million bucks upgrading everybody. There's an egg incubation thing here though

1034
02:52:17,520 --> 02:52:41,989
I need to find the egg. Where's the egg? I don't even there's a cave here. There's a cave here

1035
02:52:42,229 --> 02:52:43,909
All right. I'm gonna go to the cave

1036
02:52:43,909 --> 02:52:45,600
and see

1037
02:52:45,600 --> 02:52:49,120
We're just gonna go straight

1038
02:52:53,059 --> 02:53:15,520
Okay. Yeah, then right food

1039
02:53:15,760 --> 02:53:20,680
Uh, i'll pick up food in a second. There's a there's a cave here though. It's like right here somewhere

1040
02:53:23,620 --> 02:53:39,360
Where is it? Right here? Right here? Where is it? Oh, there it is. All right, let's go in

1041
02:53:43,430 --> 02:53:44,850
Ooh

1042
02:53:44,850 --> 02:54:19,920
Get that can I pick that up? Oh, i'm hungry. I don't have food. Somebody that has food everybody's any food

1043
02:54:20,079 --> 02:54:28,180
What the fuck are we doing?

1044
02:54:28,180 --> 02:54:52,870
Yeah, just wait get some food. Fuck off. No, fuck off. I can't wait to account

1045
02:54:53,030 --> 02:54:57,719
When can I throw like a grenade down that thing's throat? I'm serious

1046
02:55:00,440 --> 02:55:02,280
Okay back up

1047
02:55:02,280 --> 02:55:07,940
Get the agro

1048
02:55:07,940 --> 02:55:17,299
Good. All right head down there. I make anybody else shiny

1049
02:55:18,020 --> 02:55:29,459
Ooh, you know who should be shiny you you're gonna look cool shiny, right will it be orange and shiny give it to the cube

1050
02:55:29,700 --> 02:56:13,139
We need an attractive cube again. Yeah. Yep. Good call. All right, let's go in the hole. So what's down here friend and

1051
02:56:14,930 --> 02:56:16,870
five

1052
02:56:16,870 --> 02:56:44,899
Wugwu, I don't have five. Sorry buddy. Come back. Maybe help him, please

1053
02:56:48,899 --> 02:56:57,879
I don't think i'm gonna I spent too much money. We got the orange um orange guy. Unfortunately, I think that's where his

1054
02:56:58,280 --> 02:57:07,559
Uh final resting place is going to be i'm gonna go up here. There's also a potential egg

1055
02:57:08,280 --> 02:57:13,040
Somewhere hang out for a minute and see if we can find it

1056
02:57:22,950 --> 02:57:26,079
Making us cry. Well, there's nothing I can do about it

1057
02:57:26,799 --> 02:57:29,809
We chose. Um

1058
02:57:29,889 --> 02:57:31,750
Wugwu

1059
02:57:31,750 --> 02:57:33,750
This is who we picked. We picked a Wugwu

1060
02:57:37,200 --> 02:57:38,639
Wugwu is pretty cool

1061
02:57:38,639 --> 02:58:18,209
Wugwu already has jump. What about over here? Egg for an egg. Whoa, I forgot what that thing was. That was my bad

1062
02:58:18,690 --> 02:58:38,319
All right, I think we just got I think we just have to go does anybody have toxic, uh defense we could go down

1063
02:58:38,639 --> 02:58:50,049
all right, we everybody get toxic defense, uh, everybody has it right does the

1064
02:58:50,850 --> 02:58:53,569
Cube have it. Yes. All right. Let's go down. Are we something down there?

1065
02:58:58,950 --> 02:59:05,829
Right on the edge here though. I'm not gonna activate it. Am I?

1066
02:59:06,389 --> 02:59:20,079
Hope not. It's down here. Nothing. No, right

1067
02:59:20,799 --> 02:59:22,799
Gotta be something here

1068
02:59:28,930 --> 02:59:52,770
What what there's really nothing down here junk i'm not missing something right

1069
02:59:54,290 --> 03:00:01,879
No, maybe it's a place to hide maybe from one of those monsters

1070
03:00:05,989 --> 03:00:10,979
All right. I gotta pick the way that I want to run here. I think it's gonna be

1071
03:00:13,139 --> 03:00:17,059
All right. So i'm gonna come across this brush over here on the left. I'm just gonna go

1072
03:00:18,159 --> 03:00:25,489
Wham straight up here. It's an egg by the hole

1073
03:00:29,319 --> 03:00:45,649
Give it one more look if we got that. Let's see one egg by hole egg by hole

1074
03:00:46,530 --> 03:00:48,739
Let's see it

1075
03:00:48,739 --> 03:00:52,389
Where?

1076
03:00:52,389 --> 03:00:54,389
We need water. Yeah, i'll get water

1077
03:01:01,639 --> 03:01:02,600
Oh

1078
03:01:02,600 --> 03:01:09,170
We get out

1079
03:01:12,500 --> 03:01:19,969
You almost got sprayed

1080
03:01:19,969 --> 03:01:21,969
Oh my god, he's so fast

1081
03:01:22,370 --> 03:01:32,149
We gotta move. We gotta move. We gotta move. This thing is just we gotta move

1082
03:01:32,709 --> 03:01:47,319
I'm moving who has fins which one of you has gills you do all right as long as one of you has

1083
03:01:47,879 --> 03:01:51,399
gills or whatever the hell it is

1084
03:01:51,399 --> 03:01:55,590
That works for me. The swimmer is dead

1085
03:01:58,659 --> 03:02:02,579
Wait, the swimmer is the one that died. All right. Well, i'll give it to um

1086
03:02:03,299 --> 03:02:04,340
to

1087
03:02:04,340 --> 03:02:09,860
Get out of here for it. Oh, oh no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no everybody dies here

1088
03:02:10,579 --> 03:02:16,530
Everybody dies here

1089
03:02:16,690 --> 03:02:22,129
No, don't poison them all please everybody get out, please everybody get out get out get out get out get out get out

1090
03:02:25,120 --> 03:02:27,920
We good. Oh, thank god. I'm so happy

1091
03:02:31,010 --> 03:02:33,010
He's so tired. Okay

1092
03:02:33,170 --> 03:02:44,209
We're safe

1093
03:02:44,209 --> 03:02:46,790
very nice

1094
03:02:46,790 --> 03:02:56,049
Uh, do we need any bigger people? I don't think so. All right, i'm eating up and we're getting out of here

1095
03:02:57,479 --> 03:03:04,930
Oh, I thought you guys said I killed the swimmer. You have another swimmer. Oh, I thought that woodway died and woodway was the swimmer

1096
03:03:06,790 --> 03:03:14,549
Well, okay. All right. I gotta move. This is a horrible route. I need to go

1097
03:03:15,190 --> 03:03:24,309
This way and up or fuck it. Whatever. I'll make it work. I think it's okay

1098
03:03:35,120 --> 03:03:43,329
Come on move. Oh, we gotta go now

1099
03:03:44,129 --> 03:03:46,370
Don't get caught by that thing. I don't know what that thing's doing

1100
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:51,000
This thing's trying to I think it's trying to suck somebody up

1101
03:03:51,559 --> 03:04:05,920
We're all here. Okay, gotta get to here

1102
03:04:09,780 --> 03:04:18,420
Go, this is a risky move very risky

1103
03:04:19,040 --> 03:04:22,770
Incredibly risky, but I think it's gonna work out

1104
03:04:25,920 --> 03:04:32,129
Shaving some time

1105
03:04:34,129 --> 03:04:36,129
Okay, i'm gonna calm down I gotta calm down

1106
03:04:36,690 --> 03:04:39,010
Come on, you're good. Everything's fine

1107
03:04:40,049 --> 03:04:42,850
Oh my god, it's right there

1108
03:04:45,270 --> 03:04:47,270
I made a mistake

1109
03:04:53,780 --> 03:04:58,920
Shit it moves so fast. It moves really fast

1110
03:05:00,100 --> 03:05:12,920
Okay, autosave is right there. We're okay. Good thing you got the crystals. I know it was stupid

1111
03:05:13,479 --> 03:05:22,709
But there's so many crystals in there. All right, let's go

1112
03:05:23,590 --> 03:06:00,020
Who's the fastest probably this game has me so invested. Yeah, kind of

1113
03:06:00,579 --> 03:06:04,370
It's just I don't know. It's cool. All right. I'm thinking straight ahead

1114
03:06:05,170 --> 03:06:14,870
From here just go get out of the way go straight

1115
03:06:15,590 --> 03:06:17,430
And then I gotta go right

1116
03:06:17,430 --> 03:06:47,459
When it drops I gotta go right left. What is that thing? Is that a bad thing?

1117
03:06:48,100 --> 03:06:49,459
Wait, what is that?

1118
03:06:49,459 --> 03:06:59,200
What what is that?

1119
03:06:59,200 --> 03:07:01,840
Oh, it's one of those flying things. I got you

1120
03:07:05,219 --> 03:07:15,399
Come on go and then it's over here

1121
03:07:16,840 --> 03:07:28,360
Right ahead blue smoke will refill your stamina. That's unbelievable to know. Thank you

1122
03:07:36,100 --> 03:07:41,159
Okay, we're safe. Very nice

1123
03:07:41,989 --> 03:07:43,350
Oh pretty

1124
03:07:43,350 --> 03:08:01,590
Does anybody still have a horn? Can you please explain this game? I am very confused. This game is called the internal cylinder

1125
03:08:03,360 --> 03:08:09,399
Game gives you an area to work with you find little creatures that you have join your party

1126
03:08:09,399 --> 03:08:18,389
there's a bunch of upgrades the internal cylinder the the eternal cylinder and

1127
03:08:19,030 --> 03:08:22,879
once you leave the fortnight circle the game

1128
03:08:23,680 --> 03:08:32,549
Crushes and destroys everything that was before and you can only move forward pretty cool

1129
03:08:32,790 --> 03:08:39,030
I got my little party here seem to be doing pretty seem to be doing. Okay, one of them died

1130
03:08:39,909 --> 03:08:41,989
Uh got obliterated by poison

1131
03:08:47,090 --> 03:08:49,729
What was this monstrous creature?

1132
03:08:51,319 --> 03:08:56,120
Was this one of the cylinder servants? He's the ones the elder had warned them of

1133
03:08:57,670 --> 03:08:59,270
It's very form

1134
03:08:59,270 --> 03:09:01,889
terrified the trevor

1135
03:09:01,889 --> 03:09:07,459
Even the voice on their memories seemed frightened of it. And then somehow

1136
03:09:08,319 --> 03:09:10,399
The trebum remembered the creature's name

1137
03:09:11,420 --> 03:09:12,639
Mathematician

1138
03:09:12,639 --> 03:09:14,819
The mathematician

1139
03:09:19,860 --> 03:09:23,760
Well, I say we don't go over there

1140
03:09:30,450 --> 03:09:32,450
We need water how we don't know

1141
03:09:32,530 --> 03:09:40,389
We need to eat very badly

1142
03:09:40,870 --> 03:09:46,370
What else has food give it to guna?

1143
03:09:53,219 --> 03:10:01,600
Okay, just get rid of these things

1144
03:10:03,559 --> 03:10:05,959
Dad get rid of those. There's no reason for you to keep carrying these

1145
03:10:06,760 --> 03:10:09,569
I'm gonna be pissed if I need these for some reason

1146
03:10:12,870 --> 03:10:15,110
You can't become double q but just food, right?

1147
03:10:17,030 --> 03:10:19,010
Yeah

1148
03:10:19,010 --> 03:10:30,069
Now we don't need these. Um, oh my god

1149
03:10:32,799 --> 03:10:34,799
crawling back over the cylinder

1150
03:10:36,260 --> 03:10:40,260
The mathematician is horrifying as quickly as he had appeared back to

1151
03:10:41,670 --> 03:10:43,639
To what?

1152
03:10:43,639 --> 03:10:47,860
What lay behind the cylinder? We need to know

1153
03:10:48,659 --> 03:10:50,659
I'm very i'm completely invested

1154
03:10:51,459 --> 03:11:03,760
All right, what's on the map?

1155
03:11:03,840 --> 03:11:08,420
Nothing, no points of interest anymore. I'm gonna explore over here a little

1156
03:11:10,799 --> 03:11:14,680
there is

1157
03:11:14,680 --> 03:11:16,600
No temple

1158
03:11:16,600 --> 03:11:19,799
That's really pretty this game's beautiful

1159
03:11:31,159 --> 03:11:34,200
I wonder what those things do they're kind of scaring me. So i'm not gonna go near them

1160
03:11:44,389 --> 03:11:46,389
Something over there now wheels

1161
03:11:50,200 --> 03:11:58,920
I think the guy is rolling the cylinder like a joint to smoke with germa with the people happy

1162
03:12:08,069 --> 03:12:09,270
so

1163
03:12:09,270 --> 03:12:11,270
I don't even know

1164
03:12:12,420 --> 03:12:16,420
I love that people happy face. I love people people is just so funny

1165
03:12:19,569 --> 03:12:21,639
egg

1166
03:12:21,639 --> 03:12:26,850
egg acquired

1167
03:12:26,850 --> 03:12:29,969
Somebody's dying here and I don't know who but someone's gonna die

1168
03:12:34,600 --> 03:12:41,350
Right. This looks very difficult. Whatever that wants me to do

1169
03:12:42,709 --> 03:12:45,520
I need an incubator

1170
03:12:45,520 --> 03:12:50,840
Get that shit out of here incubator

1171
03:12:51,719 --> 03:12:59,540
incubator

1172
03:12:59,540 --> 03:13:00,920
incubator

1173
03:13:00,920 --> 03:13:25,430
one of those cars

1174
03:13:33,200 --> 03:13:54,799
This shit down there, but I don't want anyone to get just rushed so it's safe right there

1175
03:13:55,200 --> 03:14:00,500
I would not don't jump down. Don't jump down. That's a very bad idea

1176
03:14:01,860 --> 03:14:10,719
Don't jump down. You're gonna get yourself crushed. Oh, please come back this way. Don't be silly

1177
03:14:11,040 --> 03:14:27,030
Um, I don't see an incubator

1178
03:14:27,270 --> 03:14:39,430
I don't want to go too far

1179
03:14:39,430 --> 03:14:41,840
Is there one over there?

1180
03:14:41,840 --> 03:14:43,760
This piece of shit's gonna

1181
03:14:43,760 --> 03:15:02,239
Drain all of our powers. I'm just taking it with us everyone. Be careful

1182
03:15:02,719 --> 03:15:12,549
I'm gonna be very careful

1183
03:15:12,549 --> 03:15:16,069
I'm kind of i'm at the edge of the map here. I gotta go okay left

1184
03:15:16,469 --> 03:15:37,239
I gotta go that way behind you don't say that. I think there's new shit down there. What is that? I need to see

1185
03:15:37,879 --> 03:15:45,219
What was this strange groove in the ground? It seemed artificial like something made to contain water

1186
03:15:45,940 --> 03:15:49,139
But all it contained were these large rolling machines

1187
03:15:50,229 --> 03:15:52,629
Who had built these things and why?

1188
03:15:53,590 --> 03:15:56,549
They were not servants of the cylinder that much was clear

1189
03:16:10,319 --> 03:16:35,479
Um, we have to do this. No, I can't sprint with the egg perfect placement. Don't tell me that wasn't perfect placement

1190
03:16:39,540 --> 03:16:47,170
We made it we made it slow slow down slow down if we can get out this way

1191
03:16:47,649 --> 03:17:04,000
Can I just get up that? Oh, come on. I have the super jump

1192
03:17:06,819 --> 03:17:07,700
Yes

1193
03:17:07,700 --> 03:17:18,159
We all here. Where's where?

1194
03:17:18,239 --> 03:17:27,639
Where where's where where's where oh, no everybody's here this five

1195
03:17:28,690 --> 03:17:43,920
Wait, i'm losing track of my children. Where no, we're all here. Okay, we're here incubator over there and there is a

1196
03:17:44,319 --> 03:18:11,350
Um, I think it's a baby in one of those should get two here. Aha, and then there's somebody in there

1197
03:18:16,680 --> 03:18:22,790
Wave warm. All right wave warm. Welcome to the family and

1198
03:18:23,329 --> 03:18:24,389
Vopo

1199
03:18:24,389 --> 03:18:33,700
Wants three turnips and three crystals. Okay. Well we get I already gave the crystals

1200
03:18:33,700 --> 03:18:45,139
So we need the turnips. They're all over here. Here you go. Who ate one. There were two here

1201
03:18:45,219 --> 03:18:47,219
Who ate the other one? Why did you eat it?

1202
03:18:48,549 --> 03:18:53,920
Why did you eat the turnip one of you ate one? Wait, did you eat it or you have it in your inventory?

1203
03:18:54,399 --> 03:19:16,629
Who who has it they ate it? I need another I need another turnip. There's gotta be one more here somewhere, right?

1204
03:19:17,190 --> 03:19:24,520
Bro, you had to eat the one other turnip that we needed

1205
03:19:24,920 --> 03:19:37,829
You couldn't have eaten anything else a flower a mushroom. You had to eat the turnip. Where is it?

1206
03:19:38,069 --> 03:19:51,190
How can I tell how this is where this is working?

1207
03:19:57,120 --> 03:20:02,579
Will it hang or beep or is it on a map?

1208
03:20:02,819 --> 03:20:14,180
Try it on. Yeah, i'll try it on like this plant and see what it does. It's a regular one

1209
03:20:17,270 --> 03:20:22,290
Yeah, like this. Those are like everywhere. Okay, so

1210
03:20:23,090 --> 03:20:27,969
That's what it does. This is not you tell me there's not one even in remotely in this vicinity

1211
03:20:28,530 --> 03:20:37,159
God damn it. Yes

1212
03:20:37,399 --> 03:20:51,670
Well, I need to remember the way this is in the maps right here your children inherited your lack of self-control

1213
03:20:52,610 --> 03:21:00,959
We needed i'm not going anywhere. That was three full crystals. I'm not wasting that

1214
03:21:01,600 --> 03:21:11,399
I'm not leaving till we find another turnip. There better be another one on this world

1215
03:21:24,709 --> 03:21:44,200
There's no turnips in this whole land anymore. Not anywhere. Shit. Well, let's get water

1216
03:21:55,430 --> 03:21:59,110
Dude, your kids have the hiccups. They're suffering. They're okay

1217
03:22:05,030 --> 03:22:07,670
One turnip better not be the death of this

1218
03:22:08,549 --> 03:22:12,209
Thing here hasn't even picked up anything

1219
03:22:25,360 --> 03:22:30,530
Just reload the save. I don't know how far back out how far back would that be?

1220
03:22:31,909 --> 03:22:36,709
19 seconds ago or 14 minutes ago. I don't know 15 minutes

1221
03:22:39,270 --> 03:22:41,270
That seems kind of far

1222
03:22:41,350 --> 03:22:58,040
I don't know what that means, but it's I don't like it

1223
03:23:05,159 --> 03:23:07,159
I need one turnip

1224
03:23:08,290 --> 03:23:20,000
Just one just need one

1225
03:23:33,540 --> 03:23:36,420
They respawn. I think they'd be coming up on the radar if they did right?

1226
03:23:46,209 --> 03:23:47,809
I think

1227
03:23:47,809 --> 03:23:56,959
There are no turnips. I looked everywhere

1228
03:24:03,110 --> 03:24:08,260
No

1229
03:24:08,260 --> 03:24:13,670
Check back. Yeah, let's go back to where it was that was

1230
03:24:14,870 --> 03:24:32,000
Over here. I do need to eat though. Hold on honey. Whatever. These things are coral reef doesn't help me

1231
03:24:32,319 --> 03:24:48,450
I thought you were a plant. Okay, let's make our way back

1232
03:24:59,860 --> 03:25:08,209
That's an interesting thing going on over there in the distance. I don't know if that is all right. It's over here

1233
03:25:11,040 --> 03:25:16,159
There ain't any there's no fucking turnips. They they wait. Wait a minute. These are the trees. These are the trees

1234
03:25:16,319 --> 03:25:20,770
I need to eat these these are the flying trees. I'm very excited right now

1235
03:25:23,059 --> 03:25:28,579
Finally the weeping oh shit the elder had told them to find were within the trebum's grasp

1236
03:25:28,819 --> 03:25:35,379
But though the trebum were happy they realized that they faced a new challenge

1237
03:25:36,920 --> 03:25:42,280
The ripe fruit were floating out of reach and the others were enclosed in a hard shell

1238
03:25:42,920 --> 03:26:00,879
They would have to find a way to crack them open. Uh like that, right? This is

1239
03:26:03,409 --> 03:26:05,409
Somebody we need to experiment on somebody

1240
03:26:08,879 --> 03:26:42,579
You the one that looks like a goldfish you do it good luck godspeed his power is stupid

1241
03:26:44,260 --> 03:26:51,139
Okay, so they can float should everybody have this I wonder because this is probably body, right?

1242
03:26:51,459 --> 03:26:57,600
What does this count as something else?

1243
03:27:01,559 --> 03:27:11,270
I wonder will they all just fly i'm gonna yeah, i'll take a few because I want to make sure I have a few

1244
03:27:11,909 --> 03:27:17,600
just for later

1245
03:27:17,600 --> 03:27:23,270
Test it on the cube. That's a good call. All right, what happens if you eat this?

1246
03:27:31,280 --> 03:27:45,700
Why did that not break? Okay, so it is it does count as

1247
03:27:46,340 --> 03:28:00,770
Body who doesn't have one body thing disco ball. I think it's okay as long as one of them has it, right?

1248
03:28:01,250 --> 03:28:14,520
I think that that's fine. It's yeah. It's a it's an attractive balloon now. Yeah, we're good. Okay, can't roll anymore. Yeah again

1249
03:28:15,540 --> 03:28:24,879
Uh, all right turnips turnips very important. I need one

1250
03:28:29,090 --> 03:28:31,090
Maybe water the turnip plant. I'll try it

1251
03:28:31,489 --> 03:29:03,590
I want to investigate this to whatever this is. I wonder if I can get up up. That's nothing up there

1252
03:29:20,120 --> 03:29:42,180
Are they in danger? I'm get out of the way. You know, why don't you take a horn?

1253
03:29:43,040 --> 03:29:57,459
Yeah, um give it to you. We won't maybe that it can scare him away. Okay, let's try this

1254
03:30:00,049 --> 03:30:24,739
Let's work get out of here. Get out of here. Keep going further

1255
03:30:25,459 --> 03:30:59,649
Don't don't eat somebody everybody. Follow me up here. Follow me up here. Is everybody all right? What's in there is some magical shit up here

1256
03:30:59,889 --> 03:31:19,030
What is that? There's magical shit up here. Um, we should eat this you

1257
03:31:20,149 --> 03:31:26,719
Get it. Can I eat it? Can I give it to the disco ball? Give it to gweg. Whom?

1258
03:31:26,799 --> 03:31:44,290
I don't know how that is. Should I give it to whewom? Give it to wugwol. Uh, wugwol is not up here

1259
03:31:44,450 --> 03:32:06,760
Where okay? Where is everybody? I got what I needed from here. What the second player here anything here, holy shit

1260
03:32:07,000 --> 03:32:13,489
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wugwol no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1261
03:32:13,489 --> 03:32:15,489
No, no, no, no no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1262
03:32:18,799 --> 03:32:24,319
All right, I'm freaking out for no reason. We're safe. We're all here, right? Thank God

1263
03:32:27,680 --> 03:32:29,329
I actually

1264
03:32:29,329 --> 03:32:38,209
That was as if one of my children was actually in danger. Uh, i'm gonna give it to

1265
03:32:44,069 --> 03:32:46,870
As wet wet wet wombs not even here

1266
03:32:48,200 --> 03:32:56,870
I'm gonna give it a wee wham. I think wee wham should have it. Okay, who's got it on them?

1267
03:33:01,879 --> 03:33:17,719
Wee wham. Yeah. All right. We won't try it meteor feet

1268
03:33:22,040 --> 03:33:35,829
I can do a ground pound those legs should have given it to gunu. I didn't know what it was though

1269
03:33:39,680 --> 03:33:45,489
I wonder if I can stomp on this thing now. This is a really bad testing of hypothesis here

1270
03:33:47,250 --> 03:34:12,389
But I mean thought I had the horn, but I don't have who is the horn. We're good. Okay. Is there any turnips over here?

1271
03:34:12,790 --> 03:34:18,340
What do you need?

1272
03:34:18,340 --> 03:34:24,600
God damn it. No fucking turnips or anything either

1273
03:34:40,579 --> 03:34:49,799
Oh, I can change that's what was going on. Okay. Well got some new abilities found the tree

1274
03:34:51,540 --> 03:34:58,530
Now let's go back to the turn turnip is down here and then i'm imagining I probably have to float over

1275
03:34:59,010 --> 03:35:05,430
Let me just see if the turnips respond is that a chest

1276
03:35:06,579 --> 03:35:09,190
Where is that?

1277
03:35:09,190 --> 03:35:11,959
What do you mean?

1278
03:35:11,959 --> 03:35:16,530
the chest

1279
03:35:16,530 --> 03:35:26,709
Maybe just an inactive roller

1280
03:35:28,530 --> 03:35:45,360
That's cool. All right. There's the ball with the turnip. Don't think I can get it

1281
03:35:47,879 --> 03:35:54,280
Uh try anything on the pillar. Yeah, that's what is that? That's the what power is this?

1282
03:36:01,000 --> 03:36:03,000
Don't stomp your friends, please

1283
03:36:03,479 --> 03:36:07,379
That's the third idea good to have

1284
03:36:07,620 --> 03:36:11,959
I'm just storing it. Maybe somebody else just have it

1285
03:36:12,600 --> 03:36:14,600
Uh, i'm gonna give it to the stop

1286
03:36:14,840 --> 03:36:26,159
Look i'm turnips. We got a raid. Oh, we did have a raid

1287
03:36:27,549 --> 03:36:36,659
Automated what's up auto? Thanks for the raid auto be having a good night

1288
03:36:42,069 --> 03:36:44,069
Out of water. Yeah, i'm heading over there now

1289
03:36:49,280 --> 03:37:00,600
Turnip there were three turnips here one two

1290
03:37:01,479 --> 03:37:08,629
Three and you ate one of them you did you ate one and now we cannot save our

1291
03:37:09,190 --> 03:37:14,159
Friend and we have to abandon the friend now. We wasted three crystals

1292
03:37:14,239 --> 03:37:16,239
I'm glad you ate it

1293
03:37:16,319 --> 03:37:18,319
I'm glad it was delicious

1294
03:37:18,399 --> 03:37:32,739
But you wasted three crystals. That's a huge amount of currency. This one looks a little more green to you

1295
03:37:42,770 --> 03:37:44,770
Can I take I can't take the crystal back?

1296
03:37:46,790 --> 03:37:48,790
Water for more than half a second

1297
03:37:48,870 --> 03:37:52,260
I mean, we're all just sitting here watering it

1298
03:37:59,430 --> 03:38:02,559
No, it's not gonna work

1299
03:38:02,559 --> 03:38:04,559
That's sad. Um unfortunate

1300
03:38:07,870 --> 03:38:11,969
unfortunate

1301
03:38:11,969 --> 03:38:13,170
I got my

1302
03:38:13,170 --> 03:38:15,010
thing that finds

1303
03:38:15,010 --> 03:38:17,010
Ernie it's uh, I think that's it

1304
03:38:17,409 --> 03:38:20,100
I think we lost three crystals

1305
03:38:28,870 --> 03:38:32,760
All right

1306
03:38:32,760 --> 03:38:35,270
shit

1307
03:38:35,270 --> 03:38:36,790
That's so sad

1308
03:38:36,790 --> 03:38:38,129
Okay

1309
03:38:38,129 --> 03:38:43,489
Well, we're leaving

1310
03:38:43,489 --> 03:38:45,489
Save him. I can't

1311
03:38:46,200 --> 03:38:54,340
Unless I reload a save from like 40 minutes ago. It's all right. I'll get the crystals back

1312
03:38:59,649 --> 03:39:01,649
So the play here

1313
03:39:02,450 --> 03:39:04,610
Is that to float over this to get to here?

1314
03:39:05,170 --> 03:39:09,399
Where's the cylinder?

1315
03:39:09,399 --> 03:39:11,399
Uh cylinder is all the way back there

1316
03:39:12,200 --> 03:39:14,840
I should be in a fine spot float over

1317
03:39:15,479 --> 03:39:30,870
Let's see. So if I go I wonder oh, no, no, there's a closer one. Here it is

1318
03:39:31,430 --> 03:39:37,750
I'll take a few more of these i'm just gonna keep them. I'll store them on somebody

1319
03:39:38,549 --> 03:39:41,520
Who knows in the hell i'm gonna get access to this again

1320
03:39:42,399 --> 03:40:00,520
Save yeah, I think it just saved right now. It is saving. Okay

1321
03:40:02,319 --> 03:40:04,479
Uh, where's my float friend? There you are

1322
03:40:05,360 --> 03:40:07,329
Okay, here we go

1323
03:40:07,329 --> 03:40:25,620
What's that even with the ability to float?

1324
03:40:26,420 --> 03:40:32,979
Overcoming the cylinder would have to be done very carefully what they needed was a geyser that was well positioned

1325
03:40:33,379 --> 03:40:36,100
Close to the cylinder when it lays still

1326
03:40:36,739 --> 03:40:38,739
Or their plan would never work

1327
03:40:39,379 --> 03:40:41,379
They would have to keep looking

1328
03:40:41,620 --> 03:40:48,120
And meanwhile they would try not to think about what sort of monster could kill one of the flying serpents

1329
03:41:02,790 --> 03:41:04,229
Oh, okay

1330
03:41:09,479 --> 03:41:16,440
Okay in order to float above the eternal cylinder you must find a geyser that is close to the cylinder when it lies dormant

1331
03:41:17,250 --> 03:41:22,209
The eternal cylinder will never allow the trepum to jump over it while it is advancing

1332
03:41:22,450 --> 03:41:36,500
I mean, I guess I gotta I gotta just kind of I gotta go

1333
03:41:58,440 --> 03:42:13,170
Everyone's making it. We're good. Okay. Here comes the border border here. All right float. Holy shit

1334
03:42:14,229 --> 03:42:16,000
uh

1335
03:42:16,000 --> 03:42:21,729
Really bad timing really bad timing go

1336
03:42:29,120 --> 03:42:44,610
We're good, bro

1337
03:42:45,010 --> 03:42:47,200
Why?

1338
03:42:47,200 --> 03:42:48,959
No

1339
03:42:48,959 --> 03:42:50,840
No

1340
03:42:50,840 --> 03:42:52,319
No

1341
03:42:52,319 --> 03:42:53,440
Um

1342
03:42:53,440 --> 03:42:57,030
No, um

1343
03:42:57,030 --> 03:43:14,549
No, the whole family made it barely

1344
03:43:20,920 --> 03:43:51,860
Old you just you just ate the why'd you do that? That was mean you got you're on kind of a mean streak right now

1345
03:43:52,100 --> 03:44:22,340
Okay, is there a geyser here? I would imagine not probably later. What the fuck is that? That's terrifying. It's sniffing. Okay

1346
03:44:29,040 --> 03:44:31,040
Okay, it's out of here

1347
03:44:31,120 --> 03:44:34,319
Please come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Just I don't know what to I don't know where to go

1348
03:44:34,719 --> 03:44:41,430
I don't know where to go

1349
03:44:41,430 --> 03:44:42,309
um

1350
03:44:42,309 --> 03:44:46,340
We need coats we need coats

1351
03:44:53,399 --> 03:44:59,909
Look at the chat. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What the geyser geyser geyser it was where I was being I see it right there

1352
03:44:59,909 --> 03:45:52,440
I was getting chased by this weird bird elephant thing our home

1353
03:45:53,559 --> 03:46:00,530
Our world. Oh, that's ominous

1354
03:46:03,809 --> 03:46:06,850
Drop down. What if I just run across?

1355
03:46:07,409 --> 03:46:12,870
Cover their eyes

1356
03:46:12,870 --> 03:46:37,969
I don't know if this is a good idea the other side

1357
03:46:38,850 --> 03:46:56,290
this thing

1358
03:46:56,290 --> 03:46:57,569
That's new

1359
03:46:57,569 --> 03:46:59,569
Is it new? No, it's

1360
03:46:59,569 --> 03:47:05,989
not oh

1361
03:47:05,989 --> 03:47:07,110
my

1362
03:47:07,110 --> 03:47:11,270
God

1363
03:47:11,270 --> 03:47:13,989
We'll get back up when we go back up, please

1364
03:47:15,459 --> 03:47:18,579
We just we're just gonna get out of here. We're just gonna get out of here here

1365
03:47:27,200 --> 03:47:28,639
What just happened?

1366
03:47:28,639 --> 03:47:46,049
We all here holy shit in the dream inside the strange giant's mind

1367
03:47:46,690 --> 03:47:49,170
The voice that spoke to the trebum seemed different

1368
03:47:50,239 --> 03:47:53,280
It was less like a memory more like something

1369
03:47:54,319 --> 03:47:55,520
alive

1370
03:47:55,520 --> 03:48:05,940
But there were so many other voices too. The gang goes up against the god. This is very bright

1371
03:48:16,200 --> 03:48:19,559
What the fuck that just made me sick

1372
03:48:21,379 --> 03:48:23,860
I remember the faces. Wait, where do I go?

1373
03:48:24,659 --> 03:48:29,329
Oh, no

1374
03:48:44,760 --> 03:48:47,010
We lost a couple people

1375
03:48:47,010 --> 03:48:51,489
I don't I think I think they're fine though. There was something hidden in this place

1376
03:48:52,389 --> 03:48:54,709
And the voice wanted the trebum to find it

1377
03:48:55,329 --> 03:48:57,329
dmt breakthrough

1378
03:48:58,129 --> 03:49:03,729
I took dmt. I remember a city built. I was a little fucking weird frog person

1379
03:49:05,709 --> 03:49:09,790
When I was fucked up, I was eating things that gave me different powers

1380
03:49:11,809 --> 03:49:17,010
Running for this giant cylinder. This really does feel like an acid trip somebody explaining to you their acid trip

1381
03:49:23,069 --> 03:49:32,610
beauty each voice

1382
03:49:32,690 --> 03:49:37,569
Was a memory a song from a forgotten time slowly fading

1383
03:49:38,719 --> 03:49:40,719
Hold on. I don't want to make any

1384
03:49:42,239 --> 03:49:48,750
Memories of things that trebum had once been capable of perhaps the voice suggested

1385
03:49:49,629 --> 03:49:51,629
These could be reclaimed

1386
03:49:52,739 --> 03:49:56,979
I remember our towers stretched out to the sky

1387
03:49:58,020 --> 03:50:00,020
Yearning for the stars

1388
03:50:00,989 --> 03:50:05,469
They were symbols of our best. I am tripping right now. I'm

1389
03:50:06,909 --> 03:50:08,909
It's kind of late

1390
03:50:10,350 --> 03:50:12,350
As we fought for change

1391
03:50:13,219 --> 03:50:15,219
For a world that was

1392
03:50:15,780 --> 03:50:17,870
different

1393
03:50:17,870 --> 03:50:19,549
Then it came

1394
03:50:19,549 --> 03:50:21,549
And the towers fell

1395
03:50:21,549 --> 03:50:23,790
Somebody said cool math games

1396
03:50:24,909 --> 03:50:29,260
Where our voices now songs

1397
03:50:30,559 --> 03:50:33,440
I only hear one and it is

1398
03:50:35,229 --> 03:50:37,969
eternal

1399
03:50:37,969 --> 03:50:39,889
So, what are we are we?

1400
03:50:39,889 --> 03:50:41,409
I'm very curious

1401
03:50:41,409 --> 03:50:49,629
I guess we're just walking has the memories returned to the trebum old abilities

1402
03:50:50,510 --> 03:50:53,549
Stolen by the cylinder were finally restored

1403
03:50:54,959 --> 03:50:56,959
But there was so much more

1404
03:50:57,680 --> 03:50:59,680
The voice had answers

1405
03:51:00,000 --> 03:51:01,040
but

1406
03:51:01,040 --> 03:51:03,040
It was

1407
03:51:03,600 --> 03:51:09,899
Frightening as it was the trebum would have to come back sacrifice gunu

1408
03:51:10,540 --> 03:51:14,379
I'm getting contact high from this game

1409
03:51:18,370 --> 03:51:35,809
Loud okay, wait, he's rolling this place of death and nothingness

1410
03:51:36,450 --> 03:51:38,629
There were no answers to be found here

1411
03:51:39,489 --> 03:51:43,809
The voice and their memories urge them to return to the lands of the living

1412
03:51:44,819 --> 03:51:48,979
He's the one rolling it. It's not just like a sentient thing. It's he's

1413
03:51:50,100 --> 03:51:52,260
Is he's wrote wait, there's like stuff here

1414
03:51:54,100 --> 03:51:55,139
Yeah

1415
03:51:55,139 --> 03:51:56,260
Crunchies

1416
03:51:56,260 --> 03:52:05,700
What this thing was a we saw this before this weird skeleton

1417
03:52:08,979 --> 03:52:23,440
That's not a time to celebrate by the way, just saying that's interesting. So I

1418
03:52:24,319 --> 03:52:27,270
This is freaky. Okay

1419
03:52:29,399 --> 03:52:32,680
This is the movie trailer for the gritty reboot of cuber

1420
03:52:33,399 --> 03:52:38,840
well, I guess we're going back but

1421
03:52:39,319 --> 03:52:44,899
Like that

1422
03:52:44,899 --> 03:52:48,200
Yeah this time this time he's uncensored

1423
03:52:48,819 --> 03:53:08,520
I don't look so good

1424
03:53:08,840 --> 03:53:16,899
Thank you

1425
03:53:16,899 --> 03:53:21,680
What is that thing?

1426
03:53:22,000 --> 03:53:24,239
Um

1427
03:53:24,239 --> 03:53:26,239
Oh, no, how do I save him?

1428
03:53:27,219 --> 03:53:28,819
No, govu

1429
03:53:28,819 --> 03:53:30,579
Govu's dead

1430
03:53:30,579 --> 03:53:32,899
Was dead. He's the one that can float

1431
03:53:33,780 --> 03:53:35,299
Excuse me

1432
03:53:35,299 --> 03:53:38,950
Come on. Come on. We gotta go. We gotta go

1433
03:53:40,530 --> 03:53:42,370
Wait float, please

1434
03:53:42,370 --> 03:53:45,569
A profound feeling of futility overcame the trebuch

1435
03:53:46,850 --> 03:53:48,690
Govu's dead

1436
03:53:48,690 --> 03:53:53,250
What the fuck is all this shit? I'm sorry, but this was not over here

1437
03:53:55,360 --> 03:53:57,040
to make matters worse

1438
03:53:57,040 --> 03:53:59,600
Ahead of them lay the cold and snowy lands

1439
03:53:59,760 --> 03:54:01,760
The tundra

1440
03:54:01,760 --> 03:54:07,120
What a very nice place for trebum who are not meant to get out of the way get out of the way we need the okay

1441
03:54:07,680 --> 03:54:12,639
Okay, narrator. This is not a please. Stop talking to me that they could find help

1442
03:54:14,020 --> 03:54:16,180
We need to get warm right now

1443
03:54:17,479 --> 03:54:19,479
I can't believe

1444
03:54:19,719 --> 03:54:22,020
Okay, eat eat eat eat eat eat

1445
03:54:22,020 --> 03:54:26,659
Uh, we're good. If the trebum were going to deal with this terrible cold

1446
03:54:27,569 --> 03:54:30,370
They needed to find a mutation that would keep them warm

1447
03:54:30,850 --> 03:54:32,850
God damn their memories

1448
03:54:33,409 --> 03:54:36,770
That the answer lay in the odd little purple furball

1449
03:54:37,569 --> 03:54:43,809
That grew where the beautiful snow corals rose from the ground. That thing is coming back and I don't know how to deal with it

1450
03:54:45,510 --> 03:54:47,350
It's just taken

1451
03:54:47,350 --> 03:54:50,709
It's taken my govu's and whatever these things are

1452
03:54:51,350 --> 03:54:54,549
Where do I need to go from here? There is no map

1453
03:54:55,860 --> 03:54:56,739
um

1454
03:54:56,739 --> 03:54:58,739
Okay, i'm just going this way

1455
03:54:59,319 --> 03:55:16,450
Scare it with a horn come here fuck out of here get out of here

1456
03:55:19,840 --> 03:55:41,059
That's for govu

1457
03:55:41,059 --> 03:55:46,319
Do water? Yeah, take it. I this I have the stomp ability too with this

1458
03:55:50,979 --> 03:55:57,540
Oh, what is this? Uh, I don't want to lose the stomp. I don't want to who should I give this to?

1459
03:55:58,579 --> 03:56:09,200
This game is 13 hours long

1460
03:56:11,139 --> 03:56:13,540
That's pretty that's cool. I'm gonna give it to you

1461
03:56:14,340 --> 03:56:18,629
Because I feel like you got the webbed feet, but what else you got?

1462
03:56:21,000 --> 03:56:22,440
The yellow guy

1463
03:56:22,440 --> 03:56:24,440
Actually yellow guy doesn't have anything

1464
03:56:27,030 --> 03:56:28,149
very true

1465
03:56:28,149 --> 03:56:47,860
Ignites a small flame at the tip. I got a fire blow blower. Okay, do you don't get burnt to death, please?

1466
03:56:48,579 --> 03:56:57,510
What is that thing? I don't this thing's interesting. I don't know what it does, but I have it now

1467
03:56:59,319 --> 03:57:01,319
big like burning rock

1468
03:57:01,479 --> 03:57:05,510
Okay, i'm gonna throw this at somebody

1469
03:57:05,670 --> 03:57:11,920
What's that? Is it the same thing?

1470
03:57:15,079 --> 03:57:18,770
It's like a jewel

1471
03:57:18,770 --> 03:57:19,809
Ah

1472
03:57:19,809 --> 03:57:23,280
All right

1473
03:57:23,280 --> 03:57:36,719
Kind of like a lantern maybe oh my fucking god. I need to eat. You're right. I completely forgot it existed

1474
03:57:50,049 --> 03:58:02,319
Did I cook the food what happens if I cook the food do anything different I don't think so

1475
03:58:08,280 --> 03:58:10,280
Get the heat source back. Yeah, I will

1476
03:58:10,520 --> 03:58:15,520
Want to eat a bunch of food?

1477
03:58:15,520 --> 03:58:18,469
You need to avenge govu

1478
03:58:18,469 --> 03:58:22,399
I don't know if I can do that

1479
03:58:22,399 --> 03:58:24,950
Okay, we're good

1480
03:58:24,950 --> 03:58:27,030
Uh, i'm gonna get that heat source back

1481
03:58:27,909 --> 03:58:40,709
I'm just taking it with us

1482
03:58:40,709 --> 03:58:42,549
We'll light the bird on fire

1483
03:58:42,549 --> 03:58:53,489
This game is 69 hours long

1484
03:58:54,049 --> 03:59:02,450
Go roast that motherfucker. No, it's okay

1485
03:59:06,690 --> 03:59:08,690
I am gonna check down here though

1486
03:59:31,459 --> 03:59:33,059
Please do anything

1487
03:59:33,059 --> 03:59:43,299
No, are you afraid of the bird? I mean maybe a little

1488
03:59:45,520 --> 03:59:50,469
He instantly killed my one of my friends. Of course i'm gonna be a little apprehensive

1489
04:00:03,809 --> 04:00:07,190
All right. I don't want to leave yet. There's nothing really down here

1490
04:00:07,670 --> 04:00:17,270
All right, I got a question for you. We can do a poll. Do you want to see me complete this game?

1491
04:00:17,989 --> 04:00:22,389
Yes, or no if the answer is yes, this is what we will play

1492
04:00:26,709 --> 04:00:38,760
That's a lot of yeses. All right, we don't even do a poll. It's not necessary. I wonder what this thing is for though

1493
04:00:39,600 --> 04:00:48,440
All right, uh gunu you need to get food a lot of it gunu should be the one doing this

1494
04:00:52,200 --> 04:00:58,209
Give all the food to gunu

1495
04:00:58,750 --> 04:01:00,290
92% damn, okay

1496
04:01:00,290 --> 04:01:08,520
One of those motherfuckers over there. All right, that's plenty

1497
04:01:13,489 --> 04:01:15,489
Never gonna play sorcery ever again

1498
04:01:16,399 --> 04:01:20,389
Yes, I will I promise look at this little guy

1499
04:01:26,180 --> 04:01:28,180
Um, that's all right. What's this?

1500
04:01:28,739 --> 04:01:37,000
Who should eat who's gonna eat this?

1501
04:01:37,000 --> 04:01:38,040
uh

1502
04:01:38,040 --> 04:01:46,920
Wugwool you think so?

1503
04:01:48,819 --> 04:01:51,379
All right. Wugwool you eat this thing

1504
04:01:51,379 --> 04:01:54,879
Probably a spiky head

1505
04:01:54,879 --> 04:01:57,920
What are you doing? They're just rubbing their butts. What were they doing? Okay

1506
04:02:00,629 --> 04:02:02,629
All right kind of mutate

1507
04:02:10,129 --> 04:02:15,889
Analytical eyes can tag creatures and add them to your compendium there. You can find important information about their behavior

1508
04:02:16,770 --> 04:02:18,770
With this new pair of eyes

1509
04:02:21,010 --> 04:02:21,889
Well

1510
04:02:21,889 --> 04:02:24,610
To be perfectly honest, they felt rather silly

1511
04:02:25,559 --> 04:02:27,319
but despite that

1512
04:02:27,319 --> 04:02:34,360
The voice and their minds told them with these eyes they could learn much about the creatures they encountered

1513
04:02:34,680 --> 04:02:36,680
Okay, the voice was glad about this

1514
04:02:37,159 --> 04:02:39,799
It was knowledgeable in the manner of animals

1515
04:02:40,680 --> 04:02:46,680
And now it could contribute its wisdom to their memories so I can tag monsters

1516
04:02:47,479 --> 04:02:49,479
Try to avoid them or something probably

1517
04:02:50,500 --> 04:02:52,549
What's the big shadow?

1518
04:02:52,549 --> 04:02:55,879
What's the big shadow? What's that?

1519
04:02:56,520 --> 04:03:01,190
This game is so scary

1520
04:03:01,190 --> 04:03:04,790
Okay

1521
04:03:04,790 --> 04:03:06,479
um

1522
04:03:06,479 --> 04:03:08,479
I still can't see but

1523
04:03:09,079 --> 04:03:10,760
I know it's up there

1524
04:03:10,760 --> 04:03:18,120
Plenty of food. I got the cold resist

1525
04:03:22,340 --> 04:03:24,340
I pat I wonder what I give it

1526
04:03:24,420 --> 04:03:26,420
What happened to that egg that I had?

1527
04:03:27,559 --> 04:03:34,290
That is completely scared of it. How are you just activated has a quest

1528
04:03:36,530 --> 04:03:37,809
It does

1529
04:03:37,809 --> 04:03:55,540
Look at that. It makes me hungry

1530
04:03:56,260 --> 04:03:58,180
I could I should probably eat too

1531
04:03:58,180 --> 04:04:02,659
I'm probably not gonna stream that much longer

1532
04:04:02,659 --> 04:04:03,620
um

1533
04:04:03,620 --> 04:04:07,799
You probably imagine some of these later night. Just hang out streams will be

1534
04:04:08,850 --> 04:04:10,530
not like

1535
04:04:10,530 --> 04:04:12,129
Eight hours long

1536
04:04:12,129 --> 04:04:21,590
Okay, hold on. I'll finish it though. I will

1537
04:04:26,370 --> 04:04:28,370
pink and green

1538
04:04:29,780 --> 04:04:43,700
Cool. I'll do this tower. Uh, this whatever this little um zone thing under here. Wait, where's my horn blower?

1539
04:04:44,100 --> 04:04:54,520
Where's my horn blower? Hey, fuck you

1540
04:04:55,479 --> 04:05:22,709
You see anything yell really doesn't like the horn at all. Oh

1541
04:05:23,270 --> 04:05:33,270
I think I think they're okay. They just got smashed in the face

1542
04:05:33,829 --> 04:05:37,479
Look, they hurt a little but it's okay

1543
04:05:38,959 --> 04:05:44,799
oh

1544
04:05:44,799 --> 04:06:01,780
Get that thing out here. I don't want that thing swooping down. Everybody. All right. Where's guna? What is right here? What's that?

1545
04:06:02,180 --> 04:06:16,719
Oh shit. Oh, it's just water. I think this is an upgrade place, but I don't have that much

1546
04:06:17,120 --> 04:06:23,219
Should I even go in here because it's gonna when I get out it's gonna um walk it behind me

1547
04:06:23,540 --> 04:06:36,879
Commit to it. Yeah, you should save it. I don't I feel like I kind of have to just get out of here

1548
04:06:39,200 --> 04:07:03,190
Yeah, it should give me a couple. I don't know if it's enough though activate save up for the guy you just saw

1549
04:07:06,610 --> 04:07:07,909
Yeah

1550
04:07:07,909 --> 04:07:12,819
I gotta go into more caves underground more feel like i'm lacking

1551
04:07:12,899 --> 04:07:35,159
Well, I did upgrade a lot last time or I wonder if it'd be about five. Maybe i'll get from this

1552
04:07:35,399 --> 04:07:42,500
What am I lacking? I feel like the water is not a problem

1553
04:07:54,389 --> 04:08:08,319
Um maximum water at six. I don't think I have enough to do anything. I don't think I can do anything

1554
04:08:08,639 --> 04:08:23,760
I could do health health is for stamina health is okay

1555
04:08:23,840 --> 04:08:36,360
I could do health or save it to be able to get somebody save it save it save it save it

1556
04:08:36,680 --> 04:08:53,520
There is a new party member outside. Yeah, i'll save it. We want friends. We don't need upgrades. No health. No health

1557
04:08:53,760 --> 04:09:09,440
I think we've got plenty of health. Although I say that when we've seen a couple of

1558
04:09:10,299 --> 04:09:19,200
Tragedies that happened very quickly so I can understand that maybe we don't have enough health, but i'll save it

1559
04:09:29,799 --> 04:09:42,420
Who govu got his neck snapped it was really sad. I felt so bad about it. All right, so here's the plan
