00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:33,429
Oh sorry. Hi guys. It's fucking early. It's too hot. I can't, I can't drink this coffee.

2
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:45,829
All right. What time is it? It's time to go, right? I'm good. I thought it was just an Iron Man game.

3
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,750
Sure. Just an Iron Man game. We're here. We're here. I've got to, I've got to be quiet though.

4
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:58,630
Because everybody, everybody in the fucking house is sleeping right now. So I can't like be loud.

5
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:21,209
I've got to contain my joy. I can't be loud. Loud joke time? No. This shit is fucking,

6
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:27,750
I seriously like made this too hot. This is the Nintendo, yeah, this is the official Nintendo

7
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:37,109
direct robe. I have to look this cool. It's like a fucking baked potato. What the fuck?

8
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:44,859
Do I care about Nintendo? Yeah, I do. I have a Switch. It's literally in my bedroom. I play it

9
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:54,299
all the time. Welcome to day three. Do I really? Yeah, I was playing Slay the Spire on it like

10
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:03,450
16 hours ago, whatever it was, like two nights ago. Two nights ago. Look at this hair back here.

11
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:22,580
It's disgusting. What time is it in Vegas? It's 9 a.m. Well, almost 9 a.m. Do I play Smash? No,

12
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:27,930
I don't. I'm not, I'm not good enough. I got my ass kicked way too many times. Actually,

13
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:35,189
it was like three times online and I decided I'm not doing this ever again. It shut me off

14
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:43,639
with the game for the rest of my life. I do think it's a great game though. I got juggled around.

15
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,189
It's actually Italics and I played co-op together and we went in. We were like,

16
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:52,710
we practiced for a little bit. We're like, yeah, let's go. I'm ready to fucking go for it.

17
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:59,270
We're going to go online. We're going to try to like really win games. We got just so stomped so

18
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:03,860
badly. Like three or four games in a row. We just were getting juggled around,

19
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,900
thrown. It was just like embarrassing. And we just looked at each other. We were just like,

20
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:13,750
I think I was the first person to say something. I think it was just like,

21
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:22,099
hey, I don't like, you good? You look good? He's like, yeah. I'm like, yeah, I'm good.

22
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,060
We just never played it ever again. And he got controllers for it too. He was like completely

23
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,419
prepared for it. He was like, I'm going to get the game cube controllers. And we just,

24
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:39,740
it just wasn't, it was not good. It was bad. I'm, yeah, I am being too loud, but whatever.

25
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:50,870
Switch to the Nintendo stream. Is it coming up right now? Just watch it. I mean, it's about,

26
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:59,099
it's going to transition over right now. Yeah, we're good. I also heard through some,

27
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:06,949
I don't know how reliable sources. I don't think I'm allowed to stream things that are not on the

28
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:20,949
official Twitch broadcast. So I think the AMD stream may have been illegal. So don't tell anybody.

29
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:30,699
All right, here we go. Here comes the Nintendo direct. I'm excited. You're excited. I'm excited

30
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:36,779

31
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:49,060
I was like, what the hell's happening? Those coordinates, the switch LA three, 10, 20, 20.

32
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:56,459

some sights and sounds you may never leave you want to leave what was the other they don't plan

59
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:56,659

60
00:11:56,659 --> 00:12:04,500
strobe bulb then suck them up luigi's new poltergust g00 has the powerful suction capabilities

69
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:17,929

176
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:19,700
legioness and a legion are perfectly well i can't stream it i think like they're two parts

177
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:31,210
and when half of that body is about to die the legion's survival instincts kick in to save it

178
00:33:32,089 --> 00:33:40,200
no way there's no way this looks crazy it's a long shot but it's the only shot we have

179
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:50,779
it's all up to you my friend a blessing from the legion maybe i should say a curse we can't turn

180
00:33:50,779 --> 00:34:06,869
back now yes why don't you just let them win uh is there ever a scenario where it's just like

181
00:34:06,869 --> 00:34:12,360
yeah just let just let the aliens win what we got like we can't beat them just let them win and then

182
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:56,059
have something else happen destroy all humans yeah oh wishy it's like the original um like

183
00:34:56,059 --> 00:35:04,730
gangsters game i remember that game i think it was called actually i think it was called gangsters

184
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:15,050
death by our hands is not an honor they have earned they deserve something much worse

185
00:35:16,329 --> 00:35:27,000
even with this stone at my command this may not be a battle we can win

186
00:35:29,989 --> 00:35:32,949

187
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:43,500
oh this is ultimate alliance three isn't it i actually haven't excited to play this

188
00:35:56,679 --> 00:36:01,400
i got some i might have some unpopular opinions here i do no maybe i don't but they probably are

189
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:09,909
turn down your particle effects they don't have it just gets in the way it's like overwatch syndrome

190
00:36:09,909 --> 00:36:14,309
you know what i mean i don't just turn them down is it really doesn't really care that much

191
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:19,849
that's what slows all these fucking games down to a crawl is they have like 5 000 particle effects

192
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:38,619
i want to just turn them off well give me an option to turn them off it just looks messy we

206
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:23,929
kind of conflict to ensure that the worst most terrible conflict we must ask you to wait a

207
00:40:23,929 --> 00:40:29,929
little longer than we thought we hope you look forward to the latest installment of animal crossing

217
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:58,659
excited for at this e3 and it feels strange maybe it's because like not very much was really shown

here all the triple a studios have made the same constant conflict game and if we get there's all

247
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:25,960
because this is now an assessment stream here we go okay so this is this is my e this is what i

248
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:34,099
think about e3 amd but they're lightning fast processors and they're extremely affordable

249
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:44,650
graphics processing units i'll tell you one thing that i am disappointed on and i'm disappointed

250
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:49,210
with this every single year that is a nintendo direct for e3 or anytime nintendo does anything

251
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:58,630
where they announce anything no wario where no like actual real new wario where every year i'm

252
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:06,599
just like are they gonna are they gonna do it and they just don't so they did that game in wario

253
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:13,400
game for the wii u and it was stupid it was like 16 games although it was just whatever it wasn't

254
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:19,659
really that it was pretty bad then but it's been like 10 years since it's been like a real wario

255
00:50:19,659 --> 00:50:29,059
where and i those are my favorite fucking games that nintendo's probably ever made they did they

256
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:38,539
did what the one on ds wario where is dead wario where gold no but i mean like a but like console

257
00:50:41,719 --> 00:50:53,980
wario where is shit oh he is the shit i want like a full-on wario where switch you know how much

258
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:58,389
fun shit they could do with those two little controllers they could have like you could have

259
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:05,510
so many different things with the two just like they did with the wii and the screen you could

260
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:12,150
they got a touch screen and they have motion controllers rhythm heaven that would be no yeah

261
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:23,579
anything like that it would be good nobody buys them i buy them isn't that enough that should be

262
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:36,889
enough one guy that's get one sale from me every time nintendo that's a guarantee dude if there was

263
00:51:36,889 --> 00:51:43,079
a collector's edition for wario where switch and it was like i don't know like a wario mask

264
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:56,679
and like caffeine pills or something like i get it he's drinking pac-man's brains he killed but

265
00:51:56,679 --> 00:52:08,019
yeah like i fucking murdered pac-man and i turned him into a drink no this is this is a novelty

266
00:52:08,019 --> 00:52:18,579
device that came for fun um no no more heroes three uh looks i don't know how it looks because

267
00:52:18,579 --> 00:52:25,539
we don't get to see it uh no more heroes three uh was a big fan of the first two i played the

268
00:52:25,539 --> 00:52:33,110
shit out of him in college i'm sure it'll be all right i'm sure it'll be good uh what else is there

269
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:39,239
watch dogs three lots of threes lots of threes that i think would be fun watch dogs three is

270
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:43,639
in this weird space where i think it'll be fun for like 12 hours and then i'll never play it ever

271
00:52:43,639 --> 00:52:56,739
again which i don't know the minecraft yeah diablo minecraft i will play that animal crossing i'll

272
00:52:56,739 --> 00:53:04,230
play that dragon builders i'll probably play that for like 40 minutes and then realize it is way

273
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:10,059
too complicated for me and then i've got to go like file some like reports or something like taxes

274
00:53:10,059 --> 00:53:22,710
and i won't do it chivalry 2 i'm not i'm like i'm not that i'm not excited for chivalry 2

275
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:28,940
i just it's not like i think it's not good i just don't it's not doing it for me i feel like i

276
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:41,210
played mordhau and chivalry 2 would have to be way better than mordhau for me to care about it

277
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:46,409
terraria yeah i have i gotta play that i've got to play like i'm just i there's so many things to do

278
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:59,400
delton ring yeah it's hard to get excited about a game that is in okay remember when securo got

279
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:06,599
teased and it was just like a close-up of his prosthetic it was just like that's it it's hard

280
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:10,119
to be like oh i can't wait to play that we didn't even know what it was it was like i can't wait to

281
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:15,579
play with that guy's bones i thought it was a guy's bones so it's hard to know what's he going to

282
00:54:15,579 --> 00:54:25,320
even be like yeah it was a close-up of his prosthetic and it was like crunching i thought

283
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:39,690
i didn't even know it was prosthetic did i download roller champions i did not banjo all right

284
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:49,110
here's the thing about banjo kazooie that means this is gonna there's gonna be and okay i really

285
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:56,460
hope this doesn't happen but it's very possible i mean they might be like a nintendo and microsoft

286
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:02,219
collaboration where they make banjo kazooie 3 that's a great scenario what a fucking awesome

287
00:55:02,219 --> 00:55:10,940
scenario potentially more likely is microsoft rides this hype train from smash brothers

288
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:20,579
and makes nuts and bolts 2 i'm it's jet that's probably a real scenario i just it's possible

289
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:29,000
there's an equal and opposite potential way to go here or we'll get like a banjo kazooie mobile

290
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:39,699
card game or yeah or remastered banjo kazooie 1 and 2 the the ultimate scenario is the microsoft

291
00:55:39,699 --> 00:55:46,059
decides to ride this train all the way up and makes banjo kazooie 3 but i don't even

292
00:55:46,059 --> 00:55:50,219
people get so excited about banjo kazooie 3 it's not even saying people anymore right it's like

293
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:58,860
that studio has been i mean even if it was banjo kazooie 3 it's like oh i wish there was a new

294
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:02,780
game in the chrono series chrono trigger chrono cross i can't wait for the next chrono none of

295
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:07,940
the people are even still there it would be different it wouldn't be the same and we essentially

296
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:13,539
all locked ourselves in this like nostalgia box for like two decades just like let me out let me

297
00:56:13,539 --> 00:56:17,699
out i can't wait to see i can't no and then finally you get to see it it's like some of

298
00:56:17,699 --> 00:56:25,510
these people don't even work here anymore because it's been it's been like too long that's the one

299
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:30,469
problem all these sequels and all these things that we like can't wait to see it's been a very

300
00:56:30,469 --> 00:56:39,429
long time so it's like somebody writing a series of books and then halfway through somebody else

301
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:45,860
comes in and finishes that person's story it's like all right i it's it's i guess it's the same

302
00:56:45,860 --> 00:57:02,710
characters but it can be tough though and a lot of people have trouble with it game of thrones

303
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:16,659
didn't want to say anything that happened to hitchhiker's guide it's actually happened

304
00:57:16,659 --> 00:57:24,179
quite a few times throughout history why do i look like a character from greece

305
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:38,570
because this is my e3 persona what time is it that's my phone's dead uh what are you what

306
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:45,960
am i using my hair uh i use shampoo uh and then i rinse it out this is my hair look at let me tell

307
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:53,960
you something my hair looks like this for like maybe two or three hours and then it just goes

308
00:57:53,960 --> 00:58:08,090
crazy i use conditioner not every single day but i do i mean i think that the banjo part of the

309
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:13,369
name is pretty much enough right just always thought of different kind of banjo one what do

310
00:58:13,369 --> 00:58:23,289
women i want to go in by too fast am i graying no i probably will not have gray hair ever i turn

311
00:58:23,289 --> 00:58:29,289
33 this year i mean 35 what's a lie turn 34 i turned 34 this year and i'm i got no gray

312
00:58:29,289 --> 00:58:40,099
none i'll be bald before it turns gray i'll be yeah i'll be bald before it turns completely gray

313
00:58:41,369 --> 00:58:50,550
there's plenty of time there is a lot of time left uh but anyway so we got nintendo i mean

314
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:54,869
whatever they decide to do hopefully somebody cares about it and we get something fun

315
00:58:56,230 --> 00:59:05,800
obviously this is the one thing that all right so so sakurai is has his hands on banjo and he's

316
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:12,650
making banjo and banjo looks like really really great and really cool but like he might make it

317
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:18,010
too good and then like uh microsoft gets it and they like don't make it right it's like

318
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:25,429
so it'll be sonic boom when microsoft makes it that's what you should be concerned with

319
00:59:25,429 --> 00:59:42,309
because of those saying yeah sakurai is seriously like he's so talented at making characters and

320
00:59:42,309 --> 00:59:50,070
making them the way that they like really should be right every time a new character is introduced

321
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:55,429
in smash you're like oh my holy shit i can't wait to see this because it's going to be so true and

322
00:59:55,429 --> 01:00:00,260
so awesome to what the source material was there'll be little like easter eggs with the

323
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:08,300
moves they do a great job they do it better than than like the people that made the game did

324
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:15,960
does sakurai should just make every game we haven't figured out cloning yet just clone him

325
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:20,840
a hundred times and just have him make every single video game and it'll probably be good

326
01:00:29,929 --> 01:00:40,010
he works he works himself to the bone yeah he does and i mean he really does they have to and

327
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:46,809
do understand flavor when it comes to characters the actual people who own the ip forget yeah

328
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:51,449
typically i mean well think about it if you have a character that's from franchises from 15 years

329
01:00:51,449 --> 01:00:56,969
ago and nobody on your development staff has ever even worked with it before and you start

330
01:00:56,969 --> 01:01:02,440
and you make something else with that character it's just like oh i guess we do still have this

331
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:06,440
character to work with and then you give it to sakurai and he makes he like makes it look easy

332
01:01:07,239 --> 01:01:13,340
but no that's really that's really cool to see that this actual collaboration between

333
01:01:14,219 --> 01:01:20,679
because this shit you this shit that gets so tiring everyone like in constant conflict with

334
01:01:20,679 --> 01:01:30,739
each other console wars get out here this is my exclusive motherfucker i'm supposed to be quiet

335
01:01:30,739 --> 01:01:33,780
this is we got to see a for the first time in a long time we got to see

336
01:01:34,579 --> 01:01:50,070
conflict resolved we got mic Microsoft and Nintendo no conflict that's all i wanted

337
01:01:50,070 --> 01:02:01,179
i didn't realize that sony was streaming like right now what is this click the link

338
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:14,099
vermin ty two is getting a versus mode rats the rats wear the rats what is that actually

339
01:02:14,099 --> 01:02:24,860
part of the article that's fucking funny the rats the rats wear the rats i mean that

340
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:34,059
it could mean anything that's that's versus mode though that's pretty funny that's pretty cool but

341
01:02:34,059 --> 01:02:38,380
um do i have any more info up here in here in my brain that i would like to get out let it yeah

342
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:47,530
uh square enix i just i'll be honest i just i just don't get it i just don't get i and i'm not i'm

343
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:51,449
not saying that i don't think those games are good i just don't get it i just don't get them

344
01:02:51,449 --> 01:02:54,969
like i told you last night i was kind of sitting there not knowing what to do or say

345
01:02:55,980 --> 01:03:04,099
just because i made the the comment about it's like oh it's like turning on a movie 45 minutes

346
01:03:04,099 --> 01:03:09,449
in and just being like who the fuck are all these people that's like okay that's like

347
01:03:09,929 --> 01:03:13,769
going like lord of the rings right these are some of these games and some of these

348
01:03:13,769 --> 01:03:20,099
series are in like the 10th or 11th iteration now this is dragon quest 11 and i know they're

349
01:03:20,099 --> 01:03:25,219
they're different from story story but still i mean it's like some of these games are two or

350
01:03:25,219 --> 01:03:30,659
three iterations and they have like books and novels and animes behind them it's like walking

351
01:03:30,659 --> 01:03:36,280
in to a convention for one of these games where people already are all really big fans and they

352
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:42,840
already know everything that's going on and and you're in like like a super mario t-shirt

353
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:46,280
and you're like i thought this was this is not super mario and they're like what are you talking

354
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:51,429
about oh but they would probably be happy to be like oh i love super mario but then you'd be like

355
01:03:51,429 --> 01:03:58,630
i don't know who your character is and i would feel i'd be like i don't i don't understand it's

356
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:08,420
hard it's hard to distinguish these just because i don't really follow any of them i look like a

357
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:16,380
mob boss no i look like i look like the mob boss's fucking sleazy accountant i'm a guy that's like

358
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:26,679
yeah man what do you need i can make that work for you but that's not to say any of those

359
01:04:26,679 --> 01:04:30,199
franchises of games aren't any good it's just i don't get them i don't understand

360
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:36,820
watching a three it's like watching a three-part trilogy movie in the last movie and not knowing

361
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:43,019
any of the characters names but some of the things they did show were interesting

362
01:04:43,739 --> 01:04:48,139
uh but i don't really have much to say about it anyways uh what else we got we had ubisoft

363
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:58,969
i don't remember anything from ubisoft i don't not one thing i remember okay hey guys i remember

364
01:04:58,969 --> 01:05:10,300
the color of tod's jacket that's it oh watch dogs watch dogs free right okay all right watch

365
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:19,719
dogs free no that was bethesda so no i'm like putting bethesda into a different stage because

366
01:05:19,719 --> 01:05:30,360
i got that was bethesda with the problem there okay so not ubisoft bethesda i just know the

367
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:34,519
color of tod's jacket that's why i was putting him putting him in with ubisoft what color was

368
01:05:34,519 --> 01:05:46,059
the jacket it was like a it was like a taupe it was like a green beige did i get that wrong

369
01:05:46,059 --> 01:05:54,500
is it not that color it was tan it wasn't like a it wasn't like a green like olive it wasn't an

370
01:05:54,500 --> 01:06:05,610
olive somebody give me a screenshot is it did i get that wrong was that conference that bad

371
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:12,699
that i don't even know the color of tod's jacket is the most important thing what even was in

372
01:06:12,699 --> 01:06:25,559
bethesda fallout 77 uh fallout 76 is still a video game please god come play it was one doom oh yeah

373
01:06:25,559 --> 01:06:39,320
doom there was doom doom eternal all right that's cool what else oh yeah there was a couple there

374
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:54,219
was that that death loop game yeah let me see is this did i get it wrong i got it wrong i'm not

375
01:06:54,219 --> 01:07:15,539
paying attention to what matters here why did i think it was like an olive color like a dark olive

376
01:07:15,539 --> 01:07:27,210
green like taupe but you know having no saudi just it feels weird it feels like oh i wish i could see

377
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:33,130
some of that stuff but we don't all right this is here's another potentially unpopular opinion

378
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:38,329
follow these tonight today it's it's it's nine o'clock ten o'clock in the morning not tonight

379
01:07:38,329 --> 01:07:49,449
my brain is just fried um do we really need an e3 every single year do we really need that

380
01:07:51,219 --> 01:08:02,019
not really right why don't we have like a mini e3 like e2 e3 could be like the big one whenever

381
01:08:02,019 --> 01:08:07,539
it has stuff to show and e2 could be so the electronic entertainment expo how about just

382
01:08:07,539 --> 01:08:19,859
like the the electronic expo does it have to be e3 the intent yeah look at some of these companies

383
01:08:19,859 --> 01:08:26,779
nintendo already does this sony decided this year that they weren't going to do this

384
01:08:27,859 --> 01:08:35,079
nintendo decided years ago that they weren't going to really do that anymore that's not

385
01:08:35,079 --> 01:08:47,399
entertaining no they should just call it the the eae the electronic ads expo because i'll tell you

386
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:53,800
i really did feel like it i really did feel like we just watched a bunch of youtube pre-rolls on

387
01:08:53,800 --> 01:09:15,989
some of these conferences eae it's called growing up wait what we need more gameplay demos

388
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:25,930
i just i don't know i think maybe i am getting old it's always been but i feel like there's been

389
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:31,510
more to talk about but what i like i like is how like some of these indie games and indie companies

390
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:37,350
are really starting to kind of flow up here and start to outshine some of these triple a games

391
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:43,029
and companies doesn't everybody say that devolver's devolver didn't even have a conference

392
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:49,989
like three or four years ago they that that's new that's not it's not like sony microsoft nintendo

393
01:09:49,989 --> 01:09:57,909
devolver digital so it's interesting to see that there are some companies that are starting to

394
01:09:57,909 --> 01:10:09,859
actually come up here amd yeah they didn't have a car no but i mean like like a present a presentation

395
01:10:09,859 --> 01:10:18,899
like they had a presentation but maybe but maybe we just don't need an e3 every single year like

396
01:10:18,899 --> 01:10:29,479
maybe like stuff like the nintendo directs are the future but i mean next year this will this won't

397
01:10:29,479 --> 01:10:37,449
be an e2 next year it'll be an e3 they'll be i would assume we'll get an announcement from sony

398
01:10:37,449 --> 01:10:42,729
there'll be consoles next year that they're showing it will get a full-on completely just

399
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:50,810
the microsoft xbox uh what is it called what's the what's the name of the thing the stelares the

400
01:10:50,810 --> 01:11:00,630
xbox stelares the microsoft stelares what is it called the scarlet the microsoft scarlet

401
01:11:02,649 --> 01:11:07,689
there'll be that'll be on a desk in the middle of the stage it's gonna be a little circle it's

402
01:11:07,689 --> 01:11:14,220
gonna be as big as like an amazon echo it'll be this big a donut will be bigger than this thing

403
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:26,869
i'm just making a prediction here a donut's gonna be bigger than the the scarlet how is that gonna

404
01:11:26,869 --> 01:11:33,479
run anything it might be i'm just telling you it could be it's gonna be it's gonna be a little

405
01:11:33,479 --> 01:11:39,130
thing in the middle it's gonna and they're gonna sell it like it's cortana whatever the thing is

406
01:11:39,130 --> 01:11:52,699
called the halo halo what's the halo person bed audit i'll buy it if you're right good by the way

407
01:11:52,699 --> 01:12:01,689
i love i love this i love like the they just they didn't nintendo just those with oh that transition

408
01:12:01,689 --> 01:12:12,140
just like and now you know how many times they probably recorded that snap to get that perfect

409
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:19,750
there was an audio engineer sitting in a room for potentially two to three straight weeks hiring

410
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:25,960
different people to come like snap and like mixing it to get it perfect months even yeah

411
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:43,850
that was the original snap of john nintendo oh my god yeah they he snapped at a at a at a

412
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:56,100
investor meeting one time and they picked it up through the phone 1948 1962 yeah that's not even

413
01:12:56,100 --> 01:13:02,659
actually a a snap yeah if it's a foley artist yeah like somebody said they they probably like

414
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:08,579
squished a bag of carrots and like mixed it together with like somebody dropping a book on

415
01:13:08,579 --> 01:13:14,840
the ground to get that and they pulled one out like oh like get that little part right here when

416
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:21,210
like the carrots squished right there just like it's a foley artist a foley artist that's what

417
01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:35,300
they do i don't think that's a human snap it probably isn't audio editing is a ton of fun

418
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:41,449
it really is audio editing is like some of the most fun you'll ever have uh um what time is it

419
01:13:41,449 --> 01:13:45,770
we're not we don't have to go just yet but i have to dry i because kim knew that i was getting up

420
01:13:45,770 --> 01:13:50,729
this early she's like oh can you drive me here and i'm like yeah i can drive you here so i'm

421
01:13:50,729 --> 01:14:00,789

436
01:16:17,819 --> 01:16:29,130
eight p.m is like in the middle of the afternoon i stayed up all night i was thinking about doing

437
01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:32,890
that because i didn't want to miss this because i really did not want to tell everybody that i

438
01:16:32,890 --> 01:16:36,489
was going to be here at nine o'clock in the morning and just not show up so i was like fuck

439
01:16:36,489 --> 01:16:40,649
i really don't want to like sleep through an alarm or something should i just stay up the whole time

440
01:16:40,649 --> 01:16:47,739
and then like come and sit down here i thought about it no i i slept i did i would have been

441
01:16:47,739 --> 01:17:12,260
delirious i didn't well why didn't you should have gone to bed you don't want to see that

442
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:18,970
oh you should do that i've done that before and it's i just okay do you remember the first

443
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:26,739
15 to 20 minutes of this stream go watch it this it was only that was an hour and 20 minutes ago

444
01:17:26,739 --> 01:17:31,380
but do you remember go watch that i was sitting here just turning the stream on just barely had

445
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:39,420
woken up and i'm just like i was weird i was a weirdo i couldn't really make any references

446
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:43,579
my brain was just like starting to turn on okay here's here's my operating set you know let me

447
01:17:43,579 --> 01:17:49,590
give you a good example here i have a really really really good computer up here it works

448
01:17:50,229 --> 01:17:55,590
i mean maybe uh i might be kind of full my hard drive might be failing a little but it's still

449
01:17:55,590 --> 01:18:00,619
really good it still works just fine and the graphics card works everything works but i have

450
01:18:00,619 --> 01:18:05,340
like a seven to ten minute boot up sequence like if you turned your computer on it took like 15

451
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:14,420
minutes to turn on but once it's on it's it goes so i can't get an ssd i have a hard drive up here

452
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:22,380
i have a i can't what am i going to take my brain out now some of you guys some of you guys were

453
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:27,210
born with an ssd in your head and that's good that's great you can get up in the morning and

454
01:18:27,210 --> 01:18:30,970
bang you're ready to go some of you guys can it also takes me like 20 minutes to like boot the

455
01:18:30,970 --> 01:18:38,760
computer down it takes i have so many viruses you know when somebody has like a shit load of viruses

456
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:45,020
then it takes like 20 minutes for the computer to turn off and turn on i'm like your grandfather's

457
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:51,060
computer i have a bunch of viruses in my like operating system that i like i can't get rid of

458
01:18:52,020 --> 01:19:03,380
too much bloatware but i got too many toolbars i've got too many tabs open too that's another

459
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:09,909
thing i have like a hundred firefox tabs open with an operating system from fucking windows vista

460
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:25,590
still using internet explorer but it takes me a long time to boot up a very long i still not

461
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:29,989
boot completely boot up so that's why when you watch the stream for the first 20 minutes

462
01:19:31,449 --> 01:19:38,250
i am fucking useless absolutely useless i i better not ever in my whole life ever have a job where

463
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:43,850
i got to get up in the morning and like like be like ready to pull the lever you know what i mean

464
01:19:43,850 --> 01:19:50,500
like i'll miss it by like a nanosecond you know what i mean i i don't i can't have that all right

465
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:55,460
here's your job or your job is to get in here at exactly 6 a.m you sit right here and you wake up

466
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:58,899
at 5 30 in the morning you got to get here and you sit and you get all your job your job is just to

467
01:19:58,899 --> 01:20:06,649
pull the lever at 5 10 exactly i'll miss it that's the whole that's all i have to do i don't have to

468
01:20:06,649 --> 01:20:10,970
do anything i'm the person that turns on the factory you know what i mean i just have to like

469
01:20:10,970 --> 01:20:15,529
turn it on and catch it when it's going to its next uh like the transmission like it's going to

470
01:20:15,529 --> 01:20:20,550
like a ninja drive i have to like catch it that's how you turn on every factory i just got to pull

471
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:28,220
that lever that's it i wouldn't be able to do it i would i would like fucking pass out at like 5 8

472
01:20:28,779 --> 01:20:33,420
and at 5 10 when it's supposed to be pulled i would like snap out of it and pull it at like 5

473
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:38,539
11 like the factory turn off and like i would it would be 600 million dollars in damages to that

474
01:20:38,539 --> 01:20:51,850
place what scp are you talking about what scp am i do i have to contain i gotta catch it at

475
01:20:51,850 --> 01:20:57,130
the right second i'm the guy i'm the guy in that factory that is like catching the scp i have to

476
01:20:57,130 --> 01:21:02,890
do everything in very in tandem i'm the guy that lets him out you play all those games holy shit i

477
01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:10,569
can't believe scp 666 got out of his containment facility it's because germa 985 woke up too late

478
01:21:10,569 --> 01:21:15,750
and like got in there and fell asleep at his desk i'm that person that has that happened

479
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:30,489
but anyways what else was there microsoft uh scp isn't a game no i know i'm just saying like the

480
01:21:30,489 --> 01:21:43,670
the game that you've played based on your favorite uh certain service certain protocol monster i

481
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:57,130
don't know whatever the hell what is it called what does scp stand for secure contain protect

482
01:21:57,130 --> 01:22:12,760
what did i say secure secure socket what ssl secure secure uh socket encryption go to a beard

483
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:17,000
i can't it's not possible it just looks like shit it already does this is where it's where it starts

484
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:34,569
and then it looks horrible in like 12 hours service certain protocol that's close uh but

485
01:22:34,569 --> 01:22:47,109
anyways microsoft games as a service is going to be a reality sooner than you think that's pretty

486
01:22:47,109 --> 01:22:53,109
much what you need to know from that is that games as a service is happening sooner than you probably

487
01:22:53,109 --> 01:23:09,689
think senior citizen pea pants i'm so glad that pea pants is going to be a thing on this channel

488
01:23:09,689 --> 01:23:15,210
it's been a thing between friends me and my friends especially burger boy for like a decade

489
01:23:15,930 --> 01:23:19,930
more than that almost no no when did smite come out 2012 2013

490
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:25,899
since smite like released and was able to go into like private rooms it's been a thing that we call

491
01:23:25,899 --> 01:23:40,359
each other journal cries when did i cry i love this mug you get it on amazon just type in type

492
01:23:40,359 --> 01:23:50,890
this in and then put mug after it you'll find it pretty good you find a couple of them why am i

493
01:23:50,890 --> 01:23:59,479
drinking this like i'm drinking a goblet like why am i holding it like this you're breathtaking

494
01:23:59,479 --> 01:24:12,710
you're breathtaking that's it right can i tell you that i feel bad about that because that is

495
01:24:12,710 --> 01:24:20,390
the meme of the 2019 e3 conferences that's the that's the meme that's the thing that like everyone

496
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:27,659
is so glad that they got to see and i covered it up i actually was like covering that when it was

497
01:24:27,659 --> 01:24:41,300
happening so if you watched my version of e3 you didn't get to see the like your breathtaking

498
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:46,100
like the the live meme i like i've ruined it i covered it i like literally covered him up

499
01:24:48,149 --> 01:25:00,460
and twitch highlighted it yeah twitch tweeted it yeah if people whatever maybe we'll get some

500
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:13,000
new friends link it it's if you just go to official twitch tv twitter scroll down will

501
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:25,220
you find it the guy who said that is getting a free copy of cyberpunk collector's edition what

502
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:39,000
do you mean the guy who said what the guy who's but what the guy oh the oh the breathtaking guy

503
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:50,149
oh well i we got when we talk about guy there's a lot of one guys on this channel when i see like

504
01:25:50,149 --> 01:26:03,210
oh the guy i'm thinking of what one guy where it is a real life one guy scenario the guy which one

505
01:26:03,210 --> 01:26:14,060
guy there's one guy is getting cyberpunk that's that's fun that's fun i'm glad people can have

506
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:24,890
a good time keanu reeves it's key they're giving it to keanu reeves they loved that segment so much

507
01:26:24,890 --> 01:26:36,310
that keanu reeves is getting a collector's edition uh but i gotta i gotta skedaddle here in a few

508
01:26:36,310 --> 01:26:46,550
minutes so who won okay that yeah i got that up there who won e3 all of us because we get to

509
01:26:46,550 --> 01:27:12,619
experience uh probably nintendo um micro okay microsoft won in like a buy the stock sense because

510
01:27:12,619 --> 01:27:19,659
of the new console right so microsoft won okay if there's two if there's like people that like

511
01:27:19,659 --> 01:27:25,500
video games and then like businessmen in suits that trade stocks back and forth microsoft won

512
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:36,810
to these guys and probably i i mean nintendo just had stuff that i didn't have the most stuff that

513
01:27:36,810 --> 01:27:44,659
i was like oh oh that didn't happen that many other times so just judging by my oh and ah meter

514
01:27:44,659 --> 01:27:53,340
i would have to say it was probably nintendo watch dogs three looks really really fun

515
01:27:54,060 --> 01:28:01,979
but i the the oh and ah meter was uh higher i think for stuff that nintendo showed and it was

516
01:28:01,979 --> 01:28:08,630
not that long either who had the most disappointing conference i like the whole thing was just kind of

517
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:15,930
disappointing is not really the right word but nothing really like nothing really was like grabbing

518
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:25,319
but yeah but that bethesda bethesda spent like the first 30 or 40 minutes talking about how

519
01:28:26,039 --> 01:28:33,350
how much they like like love the community and like fallout 76 and look at the hey hey we're

520
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:39,750
like don't you like us we like you fallout 76 we like you you know have you heard about this game

521
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:52,600
fallout 76 we really like you so they just and fall they've had so many missteps they realized

522
01:28:52,600 --> 01:29:03,609
everyone started hating them yeah let's just hope that they kind of turn it around here it looks

523
01:29:03,609 --> 01:29:09,930
like it looks like they're trying it does with some of these things doom is really the thing

524
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:20,119
that's like doom has doom is like a canoe right and like like they just sit the the creator of

525
01:29:20,119 --> 01:29:28,760
doom eternal is like sitting in a canoe and he has like 6 000 pounds in that canoe and he has to

526
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:40,170
fucking like row it across an ocean worst analogy what i did that how is that not true

527
01:29:40,890 --> 01:29:49,270
he the dude that they got like a fucking boat full of like stuff that people don't think is cool

528
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:56,939
and then they've got doom which is people think is awesome that's a bet you know i'm gonna i veto

529
01:29:56,939 --> 01:30:11,909
that that's the best analogy of 2019 uh i veto everyone in the chat sorry room eternal i think

530
01:30:11,909 --> 01:30:26,579
just dance uh will probably i just realized just dance is madden this new madden damn okay um

531
01:30:29,699 --> 01:30:40,649
what else was there i think that's it what am i gonna do a just dance stream i would do a just

532
01:30:40,649 --> 01:30:45,399
dance stream no i wouldn't i'm not gonna say this number because it's way too high and i don't know

533
01:30:45,399 --> 01:30:54,859
some somebody somebody might just like fucking find a way so i'm not gonna say it i never

534
01:30:54,939 --> 01:31:06,229
underestimate people in this community i won't i don't i don't do that derma lied about just

535
01:31:06,229 --> 01:31:09,350
dance derma didn't even make a statement about just dance he just said it was madden

536
01:31:10,359 --> 01:31:20,489
it's new madden uh but i think that's um worsted out i just said a guy was in a boat carrying

537
01:31:20,489 --> 01:31:26,090
other like he was rowing his anchor-filled boat which was bethesda that's not an analogy that's

538
01:31:26,090 --> 01:31:36,460
an analysis i said a guy was in a boat and all of a sudden that's the worst analogy ever heard

539
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:42,380
an anchor-filled boat i talked about like reincarnating into harry potter today and

540
01:31:42,380 --> 01:32:01,460
apparently that was that was better boats all right well uh yeah i think that's it

541

578
01:37:36,939 --> 01:37:40,460
the only reason germany is excited for no more heroes is because he looks exactly like travis

579
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:45,340
touchdown look up the trailer right at the end when he looks into the camera it's uncanny

580
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:59,220
i do not look like travis touchdown i know i don't thank you for the five dollars though

581
01:37:59,859 --> 01:38:11,640
i really appreciate it i do no i don't hey niall oren again nara niall oren thanks for the three

582
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:18,439
dolls yeah the mc from persona 5 banjo and kazooie are gonna be in the next smash things i never would

583
01:38:18,439 --> 01:38:27,100
have expected a year ago no i i smacked there was a lot of rumors going around that banjo

584
01:38:27,100 --> 01:38:33,270
oh banjo's in the game remember like like two years ago a year ago whatever i was like oh

585
01:38:35,670 --> 01:38:40,069
bullshit and then it like got like debunked and then it got debunked again and everyone kind of

586
01:38:40,069 --> 01:38:52,010
lost hope and that's really really cool it's exciting to see that but yes that is true i

587
01:38:52,010 --> 01:38:59,109
never would have thought the same thing freudian weapon thanks for the 250 uh mr butt woman thanks

588
01:38:59,109 --> 01:39:16,710
for the 10 bucks is a better analogy for doom is a bird uh picking up somebody no it's a though the

589
01:39:16,710 --> 01:39:29,140
analogy is doom is sitting in a boat and he's rowing across a huge ocean and he has like 500

590
01:39:29,140 --> 01:39:37,340
fallout 76 game discs in his boat i just made it better that's so much better okay can i like

591
01:39:37,340 --> 01:39:45,909
retract that and change the joke he has like 400 he has like 200 000 fallout 76 game discs

592
01:39:47,050 --> 01:40:02,390
that's better that's funny okay let's see one some one person said it was funny thank you

593
01:40:02,390 --> 01:40:15,189
mr butt woman for the 10 dollars fallout 76 isn't on disc uh yes it is i remember being in best buy

594
01:40:15,189 --> 01:40:20,630
and it being on the shelf and very very specifically uh there was a big display for it

595
01:40:20,630 --> 01:40:28,649
and there were a ton of sealed packages and it was a perfect new jenga it had not even been touched

596
01:40:29,210 --> 01:40:38,180
right next to it was red dead redemption 2 and that shit was empty there were two discs like

597
01:40:38,180 --> 01:40:54,060
little disc boxes things to bring up to the front so put them in the boat they're just empty boxes

598
01:40:54,060 --> 01:41:01,020
yeah but they they they they personify a disc they're in a case and they're on a display

599
01:41:01,819 --> 01:41:16,630
cardboard discs with codes yeah they're gonna be any more discs anymore guys it's not gonna happen

600
01:41:16,630 --> 01:41:24,840
when we're gonna we're gonna go to completely to onto a disc not no i mean like a like a solid

601
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:38,020
state drive like not like a hard disc not hard you know what i'm saying like an hdd sd guys we're

602
01:41:38,020 --> 01:41:47,609
moving from disc to disc the cloud i don't think we're ready for the cloud yet computers aren't

603
01:41:47,609 --> 01:41:52,489
fast enough the internet's not like good enough for cloud computing to really be worth using yet

604
01:41:52,489 --> 01:42:05,670
maybe like another five to ten years maybe i don't think it's there do you remember when they when

605
01:42:05,670 --> 01:42:10,550
microsoft made it a huge deal that they were gonna do cloud computing for um crackdown 3

606
01:42:11,670 --> 01:42:14,789
and that never happened because they probably got halfway through development and realized

607
01:42:14,789 --> 01:42:23,659
that it was not possible do you remember that crackdown 3 the buildings are all going to be

608
01:42:23,659 --> 01:42:28,539
cloud computing and they go you don't even need the processing oh that didn't happen we got like

609
01:42:28,539 --> 01:42:43,270
we got crackdown one reskinned they probably had ambitious plans for that with what they did

610
01:42:44,069 --> 01:42:54,069
and it just wasn't there yet probably i think in another five to ten years there will be no more

611
01:42:54,069 --> 01:43:01,350
consoles there will be like the microsoft login and that's it you log into microsoft

612
01:43:02,069 --> 01:43:08,069
and everything's just there and you might have a little box a little small amazon echo box that

613
01:43:08,069 --> 01:43:16,539
plugs into your tv it's not gonna i don't think there'll be there's gonna be total packages

614
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:29,300
it's gonna happen listen to me guys i remember i i predicted the video game olympics and people

615
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:44,619
said i was wrong i'll be wrong again in 2019 i'll be correct in 2025 nobody else predicted that it

616
01:43:44,619 --> 01:43:55,989
was me somebody somebody will write up and look it's it's written in stone 20 years from now

617
01:43:57,260 --> 01:44:02,380
i'll be my picture will be like on the fucking hundred dollar bill of video gaming history

618
01:44:05,050 --> 01:44:09,770
they'll be having i'll be one of those like old commentators that they oh and remember we

619
01:44:09,850 --> 01:44:18,819
interestingly enough back in 2012 one of our most celebrated video game commentators to ever live

620
01:44:19,539 --> 01:44:27,500
germa985 gave us a little tidbit and then people thought it wasn't real back then and i'll get like

621
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:51,579
a whole celebrated piece egomaniac a humble streamer egomaniac imagine really thinking

622
01:44:51,579 --> 01:44:56,060
and like hoping that somebody like fucking writes a book about something you said in like a tf2

623
01:44:56,060 --> 01:45:07,380
gameplay commentary there has to be people that are like that right i mean you

624
01:45:11,270 --> 01:45:16,229
okay all right let's move on clue the start but thanks for the 250 thanks for getting up so early

625
01:45:16,229 --> 01:45:26,579
to stream today what was your favorite game shown this year um i don't know favorite game

626
01:45:28,010 --> 01:45:38,899
my absolute favorite one it's yeah i it's really easy to say elden ring but i feel like that's such

627
01:45:38,899 --> 01:45:47,140
an easy answer that there's got to be another one that i would say instead no more heroes 3

628
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:56,470
probably i i really really loved those games i thought there was so much fun no gameplay but

629
01:45:56,470 --> 01:46:06,300
it's it's a thing and it's real so what did i like about elden ring it's just another from

630
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:11,340
software game and george r.r martin is helping to make the world that's enough for me to be like

631
01:46:11,340 --> 01:46:24,069
that's a i love that but that's that's why i said it's such an easy answer i i don't know if a game

632
01:46:24,069 --> 01:46:30,680
can essentially even win this year you know what game probably won this year's e3 doom eternal

633
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:39,079
because it's one of the only video games that showed more than one minute of gameplay if you're

634
01:46:39,079 --> 01:46:54,949
just going by that so if you want that that probably is what won the whole e3 but by that

635
01:46:54,949 --> 01:47:06,069
logic star wars is in the top five because it was one of the only ones to show anything i like to

636
01:47:06,149 --> 01:47:13,260
keep my expectations very low just because of all the i mean we've seen the videos of hey watchdogs

637
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:21,699
let's go through like five filters after release of what the game actually is so i'm looking let's

638
01:47:21,699 --> 01:47:28,899
put it i'm not excited for but i'm looking forward to no more heroes three elden ring

639
01:47:33,319 --> 01:47:39,939
and i gotta get a third one come on i gotta get a third one cyberpunk is really easy to say too

640
01:47:39,939 --> 01:47:42,899
no i gotta get what's the third one that i really really cared about

641
01:47:43,859 --> 01:47:47,819
breath of the wild no i didn't play the first one i didn't play breath of the wild

642
01:47:48,539 --> 01:48:01,539
minecraft diablo uh but i is that it might be it really might be oh fall guys that yep that's

643
01:48:01,539 --> 01:48:08,149
another one that yeah that looks like it's gonna be a ton of fun or that heroes of might magic

644
01:48:08,149 --> 01:48:15,670
there was a good i forgot about i watched those trailers yesterday i'm not really excited for

645
01:48:15,670 --> 01:48:21,829
meat fortress i think it's cool and i'll definitely do it but that's not like a video game to be

646
01:48:21,829 --> 01:48:33,619
excited about that's like a cool tech display that's going to be in another game there they go

647
01:48:33,619 --> 01:48:42,520
those are probably the three or four pretty cool uh let's get the credits on screen this is probably

648
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:49,689
going to be uh it's probably going to be fairly quick here actually that's going to be really

649
01:48:49,689 --> 01:48:55,100
it's going to be really slow isn't it yeah let's get watch this this is going to be this is going

650
01:48:55,100 --> 01:49:06,649
to be weird watch ready the faster it is the more people have subscribed thanks for supporting the

651
01:49:06,649 --> 01:49:23,399
stream less than a couple hours but still thank you guys all of you vr friday no we're doing unlock

653
01:49:30,649 --> 01:49:35,210

654
01:49:36,869 --> 01:49:44,520
that's not fair if i read these then like it's not fair for people that i don't read

phil 25 for your subscription phil 25 all right now this person's like the notifications are going

657
01:50:49,590 --> 01:50:54,310
crazy that person probably thinks there's an earthquake or like a meteor is hitting earth

658
01:50:55,029 --> 01:51:07,180
what's happening what's happening meteor they're not here well whatever anywho

659
01:51:07,180 --> 01:51:10,859
uh let's this is the only couple more we got clueless sniper 250 thank you for the 250

660
01:51:12,409 --> 01:51:15,210
thanks for getting up early to stream i think we got that already but

661
01:51:17,140 --> 01:51:21,189
yeah that was a favorite game right hopefully i gave you the ones that i

662
01:51:21,750 --> 01:51:27,029
i remembered there's been a lot so lucas thank you lucas for the five dollars

663
01:51:27,909 --> 01:51:35,829
what do you think of the valve index did you get one no i have a vibe uh i bought a vibe

664
01:51:36,710 --> 01:51:45,420
like two months before all these cool new devices were announced so i have the original vibe i'm

665
01:51:45,420 --> 01:51:54,859
not going to be getting the index but the vibe works just fine so i probably won't be getting

666
01:51:54,859 --> 01:51:59,479
the index either at all or immediately i maybe i'll upgrade some of the pieces i want the

667
01:51:59,479 --> 01:52:07,960
controllers so i'll definitely get the controllers because i like the vibe controllers

668
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:12,359
aren't uncomfortable but sometimes i really do feel like i'm an air traffic controller with

669
01:52:12,359 --> 01:52:27,350
these big cones in my hands so i will definitely get the new knuckle controllers at least but

670
01:52:27,350 --> 01:52:32,979
thank you uh lucas for the five dollars and finally nile oregon thanks for the three dollars
