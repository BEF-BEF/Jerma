00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:09,259
Good afternoon. Welcome back. Red wizard. Today we're going to be doing a few things.

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:20,059
First of all before we really get into that. Did you have a good sleep? I did. I said that really

3
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:25,300
fast so you may not have caught that. I didn't. Remember how they had that headache last night?

4
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:32,899
Well it evolved into a migraine overnight and I've taken a few Tylenol and I'm all right.

5
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:39,460
I'm good. I just can't laugh that hard. Although like what a what a bad day to have a headache

6
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:44,490
because that's not possible. I'm gonna have to. I wish there was a way I could put like a filter

7
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:54,100
on my brain. I wish I could like take in a video file and like have it pre-screened and

8
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:04,390
pre-rendered and then like drip feed it into a part of my brain. Green screen movie night is

9
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:09,989
tonight. So like I gotta be ready. So I'm taking in some caffeine. I'll be fine. I

10
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:14,890
think I've took a couple Tylenol. I'm good to go. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't. If

11
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:25,159
I wasn't able to do it. So don't worry. What is green screen encore night? Well that's why we're

12
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:35,140
gonna we're gonna wait a little bit. I'm not gonna do it right away. There are about 50 plus

13
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:42,379
videos. Some of them are like 10 seconds. Some of them are like three minutes. There

14
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:48,299
are a couple of exceptions from some community members that have given us some movies

15
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:57,319
that are a little longer. It's the encore presentation will be about an hour and a half

16
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:09,080
to two hours. No it is not. 50 JoJo videos. So if you're not aware of what's going on

17
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:20,280
back in four or five months ago. Oh a long time ago. We watched about 400 green screen

18
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:27,000
videos. Since then people have made some good shit. So I obviously want to show those

19
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,879
the high quality submissions. There are still some shit posts in here. But we had a system

20
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:39,000
we weren't going to show every single one. This playlist will be publiced so you can watch it

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,580
whenever you want after this stream. And we will be doing this in like an hour. Because I

22
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:51,800
don't want to just start right now and go. Because obviously I want as many people that

23
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,080
will trickle in that want to be here to be here. So after about an hour I expect

24
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,240
most people that knew it was going to happen for the last three weeks will want to be here.

25
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:12,330
You know what I'm saying? Makes sense. Trickle. Make a playlist with every video that you

26
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:17,719
skipped. That's probably going to happen too. So there'll be just like a here's everything

27
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:22,599
and then here's the stuff that was on stream. It should be fun. I'm looking forward to it.

28
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:33,849
But before we do that, we've got some Super Mario to play. Super Mario Sunshine. I don't

29
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:51,060
know why I just said that. This is Mario Maker. Let me warm up with a couple of levels and then

30
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,060
from here we're going to do the online stuff. This is not going to be the castle building

31
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:00,740
stream. I promise. Everyone's just like oh no no no no what the fuck. He's not going to do

32
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:06,180
like Mario Maker single player just story mode again. Well I am. But just for like five

33
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:16,649
minutes. So I also have to check this too. One two three jump jump jump jump. We good?

34
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:29,959
Good. Five hours. What if I just don't do the Encore Knight? I get so into this. We just don't

35
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:39,610
ever do it. March of the Rookie Toads. This is another Peach level. Ten Toads. I wouldn't do that

36
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:49,300
to you guys. Don't have to go all the way to the left. Oh shit what's this? One two three. How

37
00:04:49,300 --> 00:05:07,000
do I get that? What's this? Can I like pull this up? I'm not going to do that. Yank it?

38
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:18,199
Can I wait can I yank that thing? No there's no indicator. I can't yank it. It's probably

39
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:27,850
to be lit up. Let's get rid of the piranha. I want to see what's down here. Reach the goal after

40
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:35,269
defeating all piranha creepers. You got it. You got it. So somewhere around I don't want to say

41
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:42,339
maybe like 430? Five pacific? 430 pacific? Oh I'm gonna know when it's been like an hour or

42
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:47,100
two because people are gonna be screaming in here. It's Encore Knight! I just I'm not

43
00:05:47,100 --> 00:06:03,529
supposed to yell it. I have a headache. What does this want me to do? Oh shit that's what it

44
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:19,939
wanted me to do. Huh? Did it. First try. Yeah that was fun. That was a good one. I think that's

45
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:31,370
enough warming up. I think I know what I'm doing. I mean if I can do that I can definitely

46
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:36,569
like have somebody honk a horn in my face and scream while I go through 18 different doors

47
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:43,480
and have them open up and have like spikes underneath me. I think I can do that. This is

48
00:06:43,480 --> 00:07:03,209
new. Oh I have this item now. I can do this. What the fuck is under here? Empty? What am I

49
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:22,709
doing? Oh this is a robot. Rebooting system. I'm sorry. Sorry. Well I turned it on. Interesting.

50
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:37,430
All right what's on the other side? Coins. Well I can't really leave yet. Hold on. Encore

51
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:45,050
Movie Knight's like paused for a minute. Hold on. Can I not break these? Beep beep. Rebooting

52
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:50,329

53
00:07:52,199 --> 00:08:00,699
Beep authenticated. Beep boop. You are Mario correct? No. Beep boop lie detected. Mario confirmed.

54
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:07,860
Beep boop beep beep. I'm a robot that plays videos. Which video do you want to watch?

55
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:29,079
Oh that's it? Beep boop beep boop. I'm going to play Encore Movie Knight. That's too bad.

56
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:50,090
Why am I even? No I don't want to skip this video. So 50 dollars came in from some guy.

57
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:56,440
Thank you some guy for the 50 bucks. They say hey Jerma I think I found a family picture of you

58
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:03,539
from a while ago. That'll be weird. Oh okay. Thank you so much for the 50 dollars first of all.

59
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:16,870
And oh okay it's a clown thing. And Jerma told the truth about X. What is it X?

60
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:30,889
Oh that was a juicy one. That was a juicy one. Anything you want it to be.

00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:36,539
Well thank you for the five community subs and thank you some guy for the 50 bucks.

00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:20,150
Super Mario. Are these people chatting? Is this a chat room? Is this just a bunch of ads?

131
00:29:32,539 --> 00:30:21,240

00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:26,819
long was that? No I got caught up on that first pole and then I got caught up on the first

pole. Oh do it again. I'll get it. I'm gonna get it. I'm gonna get the world record on this

136
00:31:55,059 --> 00:32:15,319
later. I get it. There it is. Oh did I? I think I fucked it up. No I didn't.

137
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:23,640
I think I fucked it up. I think I fucked it up. I don't know. We'll see. I know. I think

138
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:56,950
I fucked it up. That was frame fucking perfect. You can't do it better than that.

139
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:01,339
That was frame perfect. This is the one.

140
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:34,859
I can't believe it. I'll get it. It's uh it's when you go over the uh

141
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:53,910
this part here. Wait a minute. He how do you get? Hold on. I'm gonna beat it by a shitload.

142
00:33:53,910 --> 00:34:13,639
I'm gonna beat it by a shitload. That thing's gonna hit the... Watch this. Dude I have to do

143
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:22,199
it. It's three nanoseconds. I have to be up there as Jeremy 4567. I have to do this.

144
00:34:39,289 --> 00:34:43,659
I didn't even jump. What am I thinking? I'm the only person that's died here.

145
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:09,530
Oh man. I'm gonna lose my fucking mind. I have to do this. Moving height is cancelled

146
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:21,929
until I do this. I fucking lost it. I added that foot. That's I'm gonna I'm gonna see

147
00:35:21,929 --> 00:35:49,500
point I'm gonna see zero point zero zero zero in my dreams. No. No. I'm gonna...

148
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:59,849
You gotta jump earlier I think to get over that. It's not gonna be it. You gotta go

149
00:35:59,849 --> 00:37:28,699
earlier. Pretty good. Fuck. Nope. Nope. Nope. Not gonna be it. It's the treadmill.

150
00:37:28,699 --> 00:38:02,440
Oh god damn it. Oh come on. That's gonna be close. No it's that. Mario has a bigger frame

151
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:40,699
hitbox. Luigi has a bigger... It's that little bit right there. Luigi's faster on the treadmill.

152
00:38:41,340 --> 00:39:02,940
Are you serious? Is Toad just screwing me over here? What did I just do? What was it?

153
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:07,690
What was it for? What's the default? No. Nintendo. I want to press B.

154
00:39:37,320 --> 00:40:09,960
I got to point three nanoseconds man. Pretty good. Oh my god. My god damn it. My god. What

155
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:15,769
the fuck am I doing? I was trying to hit the very last frame of it so I'd fall on top of

156
00:40:15,769 --> 00:41:32,059
the axe. Pretty good. How did I get 316 before man? No. You gotta. You gotta. It's the treadmill

157
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:37,179
but how do I deal? How do I take care of that? Is it less jumps? One jump? Two jump?

158
00:41:37,179 --> 00:41:59,300
Trying to get it in one jump? But how? Lightly tap? Lightly press? Fuck.

159
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,659
No time lost. This is as fast as you can walk forward.

160
00:42:19,059 --> 00:42:33,590
Mmmmmmmmmm. It's gonna be not even close. You are 0.000003 seconds away from the world

161
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,989
record. You can move on. Chat won't call you a loser.

162
00:42:44,019 --> 00:43:02,699
Well, I appreciate that. Thank you. That doesn't mean I'm not still hungry. The thing is,

163
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:12,949
how do I get that to happen sooner? You got it. Let's probably get a way you can

164
00:43:12,949 --> 00:43:25,900
make him go fuller faster right? No, no. I gotta. I know what I gotta do.

165
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:50,179
Check this out. That wasn't running fast enough. This is the one. It's not the fucking one,

166
00:43:50,179 --> 00:44:16,780
not the fucking one. It's over! I lost! I can feel it catch it on me.

167
00:44:20,329 --> 00:44:36,199
Please stop. I can't help it. You can't get to 0.0003 to the world record on this level

168
00:44:36,199 --> 00:45:01,619
and then not do it. Wait a minute. Can I get up there from not hitting the switch?

169
00:45:02,179 --> 00:46:07,820
I'm losing frames in the start. I hate it! There's no such thing as bunny hopping.

170
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:32,679
Nope. I looked over and I just saw. What a loser. See? That was so close but not enough!

171
00:46:37,750 --> 00:47:33,300
Short hop onto the shell. I'm never gonna do it. The world record is frame perfectly time gated.

172
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:45,539
Even if you were to... Wait, what are you talking about? What does frame perfectly time

173
00:47:45,539 --> 00:48:32,699
gated mean? You can only match it not beat it. What? What are you talking about? I'm done.

174
00:48:32,699 --> 00:50:12,900
This is the one right here. How do I get? Oh, whoops. Here. Sorry. It should be me up there!

175
00:50:12,900 --> 00:51:09,460
It should be me up there! One more time. I'm done. I swear to god. I promise this is the

176
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:49,269
final one. This is the last time I'm gonna do this. That's not very good. I have to get out.

177
00:51:49,269 --> 00:52:05,780
Just go. I don't care what this is. Toad's faster. No, he's not. I only know how to do

178
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:10,980
one thing and that's the... I don't know how to do anything else right now. I forgot

179
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:21,300
how to play every other part of the game. Honestly, let me ask. How do speedrunners

180
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:25,460
like brush their teeth? You know what I mean? I did that for like an hour. I feel like if I

181
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:29,059
did that for like six more days, I wouldn't remember how to fucking tie my shoes.

182
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:59,000
My brain like hurts right now. Wait, did I just mess it up? Oh, almost screwed that one

183
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:24,300
up. I like this one. I'm hearing more than one sound for an hour. Faster. No. No more faster.

184
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:40,230
This is dangerous. You only played that level for 15 minutes? I feel like I've been here for

185
00:53:40,230 --> 00:54:25,659
like three days. Fuck. Puzzle. Epic puzzle. Hearts. Hmm. Oh shit, I was looking up at the...

186
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:54,179
Oops. Dude. Puzzle. Really. Don't do it to me, please. What the fuck am I doing?

187
00:54:54,179 --> 00:55:30,630
Stop. Okay. That was cute. That was cute. Wait, what? No. Looking good. Movie night died for

188
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:46,739
this. Movie night's still happening. When? In like 30, 40 minutes? In like an hour? I want to

189
00:55:46,739 --> 00:55:52,059
make sure that enough people are here to enjoy it. That's why I said I was gonna do... I can

190
00:55:52,059 --> 00:56:09,960
do that. I'm kidding. That's hard. Sun Touch Sanctuary. Puzzle solving 1-1 homecoming hills.

191
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:46,820
It's been an hour. It's been 57 minutes. It's just another version.

192
00:56:52,059 --> 00:57:00,309
Oh no. Oh no. Let me just get to the end first and let me see what it looks like.

193
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:31,900
I ran out of time. He ran out of time on a speed run.

194
00:57:47,239 --> 00:58:22,409
GG. What did I get? 199929. I can do it. Oh! Thought I could make it.

195
00:58:22,409 --> 00:58:40,360
Shit. Only a couple more attempts. Let me finish it like one more or two more times.

196
00:58:41,079 --> 00:58:58,659
I gotta get to the end though. Last one. One where I get to the end. You bet $50 that I'm

197
00:58:58,659 --> 00:59:05,050
gonna get the world record? You think so? I'll take that bet. Who's got that bet? Anybody in

198
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:19,610
here? Anybody betting? Anybody betting right now? Shit. That's what I have to do. I'm sorry

199
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:46,760
guys. Somebody's money, people's money is on the line. I have to make sure I try. Come on.

200
00:59:46,760 --> 01:00:01,829
I thought I did it. I thought I actually did it. One more try. I thought I was on the right for a

201
01:00:01,829 --> 01:00:47,670
second. That's as fucking clean as I'm gonna get it. Come on. 20 seconds. Pow block blitz.

202
01:00:47,670 --> 01:01:12,760
Oh I like this one. Speed run. Short and sweet. Down $50. Oh shit. That's right. Somebody,

203
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:22,230
oh somebody get, speaking of $50, Phil. Phil gave $50 and I, hold on. This is like an

204
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:37,980
hour ago. Speaking of Phil. Thank you so much for the 50 bucks, Phil. Phil 25. They

205
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:41,019
say, hey Jerma, long time watch. Your first time cheer. It's been so fun lurking around your

206
01:01:41,019 --> 01:01:49,480
content ever since 2013. Just got my first paycheck at my first serious job and I want

207
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:54,599
to give back a little. Also thanks for making me the one guy at last E3 Streams credits those

208
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:59,699
two weeks ago. Unfortunately can't catch many streams from EU so I rely on VODs,

209
01:02:01,179 --> 01:02:04,699
but it's still worth watching for the best entertainment out there. Much love and hope your

210
01:02:04,699 --> 01:02:13,340
life is going just as well. Jerma Hart. Thank you. Thank you, Phil. I do feel bad

211
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:18,380
about, I have to pick that up, about EU times ever since moving to Pacific,

212
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:27,260
but I'm at least glad that you can watch the VODs and can enjoy them if you, now that's gonna

213
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:39,179
take too much time here. I'm not gonna get stuck here. If you get world record on any

214
01:02:39,179 --> 01:02:51,559
of these speedrun levels I will sub to you. It's a $5 bill. No, don't say that.

215
01:02:59,619 --> 01:03:05,780
Fast switch thinking. Let's do this one. This one looks cute. Okay. Only 3% completion

216
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:29,429
rate on this one. And we'll get a cake Luigi. That's good. You see. How do I, why did I just

217
01:03:29,429 --> 01:03:39,989
do that? Also if I get a world record on, if I get a world record on a stage you'll

218
01:03:40,550 --> 01:04:05,420
sub to the channel. Like at least three or four people said that, right? Okay.

219
01:04:21,349 --> 01:04:33,269
I'll have to beat it. I can't even get a world record here. All right I'm not gonna,

220
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:37,110
just, they're sleeping. Just step on their heads. What's the point of that?

221
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:44,300
It's a troll purpose. What is this for? I can take my fucking time. Who cares? Get in the car.

222
01:04:58,309 --> 01:05:44,179
World record. Why would you, I can't. So get out of the car and just go in the tube.

223
01:06:03,590 --> 01:06:24,420
No go, I'm trying to just get away from this. World record. Let me see some fucking

224
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:32,940
pogchamps in the chat. I think I got it. I think I got it. What are you talking about?

225
01:06:34,650 --> 01:07:14,840
What are you talking about? Get it! A million subs. A million subs. A million subs. Let me

226
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:34,150
take a look. There it is. You set your first world record. I did it. These are all the

227
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:39,079
people that bet it against me. 10 community subs from Lexi and five community subs from

228
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:43,380
It has to be a speedrun level? Well that wasn't part of the plan.

229
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:50,230
I just said a million subs and now it and now it's happening. Thank you Bebraham for the 20

230
01:07:50,230 --> 01:08:07,019
community subs. 20 from MGSFan. Thank you for the huge subs. But wait a minute. What about

231
01:08:07,019 --> 01:08:14,500

236
01:08:59,189 --> 01:09:12,819
ABjo thank you. Can, I think I can make it across if I just go quick. Anonymous

Gay5 thank you whoever you are. Rare Pepe Body Lotion thanks for the five community subs.

240
01:09:51,699 --> 01:10:15,220
you guys don't have to do this thank you. This is a music level? How is it a music level? On.

241
01:10:15,779 --> 01:10:40,390
How do I turn it on? What's on? Thank you Spygetti for the 10 community subs.

242
01:10:40,390 --> 01:10:50,630
For heat of meat thanks for five community subs. That's not world record piss. I can do better than

243
01:10:50,630 --> 01:11:13,529
that. I'm just going through and fucking dumping on the world records because let's be let's be

244
01:11:13,529 --> 01:11:18,970
honest uh who's actually gonna play these more than once but then care enough to do world

245
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:31,960
record? I got another world record. Oh my god the Lemmy just gave 75 gold. Let's go play the

246
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:35,319
like the actual other mode because it's been an hour and I want to do the endless challenge

247
01:11:35,319 --> 01:11:40,779
once. At least before we do the uh five more subs from AB Joe. Thank you so much AB Joe. Thank

248
01:11:40,779 --> 01:11:46,539
you all you guys for the subs and uh 75 fucking dollars from uh Vilemi. Congratulations on the

249
01:11:46,539 --> 01:11:51,100
world record Jerma. Why not celebrate by chugging down a not at all disgusting Mountain Dew throw

250
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:55,819
back. Don't think I've forgotten about your lies. Thank you for the 75 dollars but I

251
01:11:55,819 --> 01:12:09,050
wouldn't drink a Mountain Dew throwback for 5 000 dollars. Thank you so much for the 75 super

252
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:21,909
expert. This is a bad idea but thank you so much Vilemi for the 75 bucks. Thank you for the 50

253
01:12:21,909 --> 01:12:29,619
dollars from Timmy. They just say oh like the oh no face oh no it's like an oh face.

254
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:49,750
Why do I have 30 lives? Speedrun. What? Go backwards and then down but thank you so much

255
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:56,920
for the 50 bucks Timmy and Vilemi and everybody that's dumping huge amounts of subs. You guys

256
01:12:56,920 --> 01:13:19,689
are too much. Oh fuck. What? I gotta do the spin move. Why did he just no no no this is not

257
01:13:19,689 --> 01:13:30,170
like I only have 28 lives. You need to spin. Spin spin spin. No I got it. I can do this

258
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:34,649
Nintendo. Leave me alone. Don't Luigi me. I'm already playing as Luigi. Don't you get it?

259
01:13:40,939 --> 01:14:16,090
Oh fuck. Shut the fuck up and beat the level Jeremy. I can go faster than that too.

260
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:21,930
You want to hear like some crazy shit? I could do it but I can't. My brain is so small that

261
01:14:21,930 --> 01:14:32,279
I can only do one thing at a time. Oh what the fuck do I go? What the fuck? Where do I go?

262
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:51,300
I don't know where to go. What what's on? Backwards? Up? Forward? Where was I? Go back

263
01:14:51,300 --> 01:15:08,789
and then to the left? How the way do I end up? Oh who cares? I just hurt myself.

264
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:16,680
I just like went to go drink my drink and the straw just like poked me like in the back of the

265
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:47,140
mouth because I leaned. I leaned. I like this one though. This one's well thought out. I'll get

266
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:56,039
this. And by the way stay tuned for the green screen encore movie night happening soon just

267
01:15:56,039 --> 01:16:01,859
like every fucking event you've ever seen. Especially on this platform. It's gonna be

268
01:16:01,859 --> 01:16:08,229
like six hours delayed. I have no idea what the hell to do after that.

269
01:16:21,859 --> 01:16:44,949
Explain to me. I have to go back up that way. 20 omega lol lives. Whatever. I swear to god.

270
01:16:44,949 --> 01:17:11,670
Super expert. I'm fine. You gotta just. I know I know what I have to do now. It doesn't. You

271
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:15,989
just hold left. You don't have to worry but you're gonna put that hat on. It's automatic.

272
01:17:15,989 --> 01:17:40,500
This is not disqualified. Jeremy turns his face come on and reveals he was dressed as

273
01:17:40,579 --> 01:18:09,779
Luigi this whole time. Even if I was who cares? What would that even matter? Hey guys I have

274
01:18:09,779 --> 01:18:36,039
overalls today. Oh shit. Now what? What the? Okay uh I got freaked out when the thing came

275
01:18:36,039 --> 01:19:15,750
off my head. I hurt. I got hit by something and he went. Oh you punk. You rotten kid.

276
01:19:16,789 --> 01:19:24,279
You punk. I don't care if I lose. I did it. I don't know what the fuck was that.

277
01:19:25,529 --> 01:19:32,090
I swear to god my brain was on slow motion. I got freaked out. I died but I didn't die. I don't know.

278
01:19:43,420 --> 01:20:03,130
Come on. Super Luigi. Come on. Everybody loves Luigi. Did I really not make that jump? That's

279
01:20:03,130 --> 01:20:11,180
unbelievable. What was wrong there? Was it not? Whatever. I'm gonna. I'll get through this.

280
01:20:11,899 --> 01:20:19,750
It's not 100 lives Mario anymore. You just have to beat it. I've already gone panicking.

281
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:30,729
Slow down. Who cares if you don't get the world record? Yeah it's not gonna look good in a YouTube

282
01:20:30,729 --> 01:20:49,130
video but I'll still get there. What the fuck is happening? If I didn't get like baited into

283
01:20:49,130 --> 01:21:02,520
jumping into those coins. Okay so am I what? Am I understanding that? I'm fine. Go back. So if

284
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:07,880
you put out. If you don't do the swimmy arms then that. What is you doing? What?

285
01:21:08,039 --> 01:21:26,949
Hold on. What is this? Hey thank you for the five communities. Never trust nanners. Thank you.

286
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:46,739
I swear to god I pressed the button. I did. I pressed it. I pressed it. I pressed it in it.

287
01:21:46,739 --> 01:22:23,220
I'm get. I'm tilted now. Excuse me what happened there? What happened? Why did I

288
01:22:23,220 --> 01:22:27,460
overshoot that? I did that every time the same way. Something must be wrong with the game.

289
01:22:28,340 --> 01:22:33,449
You know actually no I heard. I heard about that. I heard about like Nintendo was patching

290
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:39,960
some of their control issues. Yeah I started like an article on Kotaku about like control

291
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:57,939
issues or something. I almost just fucking let go of the controller. Yeah Nintendo was like

292
01:22:57,939 --> 01:23:01,220
saying at them like a press release came up from Nintendo saying like we're sorry about

293
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:07,460
the control problems. We just like didn't test them and like we're just really sorry about it

294
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:12,739
but it'll be fixed. So like when you guys buy this game you guys like get this game later

295
01:23:12,739 --> 01:23:19,430
like you're gonna have like a different game than me. So that's why like I'm not doing so

296
01:23:19,430 --> 01:23:33,979
good but you'll like do better than me because like the patches will be there by then. Essentially

297
01:23:33,979 --> 01:23:38,699
what I have to do is I'm hold I have to queue up controls. There's like four or five seconds

298
01:23:38,699 --> 01:24:10,439
of input lag. All right come on. I gotta jump like at the very last second up here.

299
01:24:13,939 --> 01:24:18,819
What is the problem here? I'm what how am I not making this?

300
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:43,720
That was as far to the end as I possibly could. What's happening? Good thing I had 30 lives.

301
01:24:48,069 --> 01:24:53,590
I did it! Okay hold on. Wait just I'm not going fast enough. What the fuck is happening

302
01:24:53,590 --> 01:25:15,590
in my brain? I just I had to I put the I put the car in reverse. Oh my god. Oh my god.

303
01:25:16,229 --> 01:25:29,430
You just have to keep moving and I didn't and I put the car in reverse.

304
01:25:30,149 --> 01:25:51,220
You can never put the car in reverse in a speedrun level. Ever. Here we go. Now what? What?

305
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:59,699
Now what the fuck am I supposed to know? Um um does he kill him? What? Back again?

306
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:06,489
What? Do you have to go boy have to go back and then jump over the coins and then go back

307
01:26:06,569 --> 01:26:34,279
down? Oh shit I'm gonna lose. This is it. This is the last chance. Oh my god what the fuck did I do?

308
01:26:35,079 --> 01:26:43,029
Oh my god. I just I didn't mean to press that button. Like sir I just I just like bah

309
01:26:43,909 --> 01:26:48,779
do it again. Fucking whatever. Oh my god I'm so upset right now.

310
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:55,180
I was pressing too hard on Y therefore every button on the controller is pressed.

311
01:26:56,520 --> 01:27:09,270
Oh god damn it give me a break. I'm so fucking mad right now. I had that too.

312
01:27:10,229 --> 01:27:15,989
I need to get like a pro controller not like the fucking side cheese it controller. All right

313
01:27:15,989 --> 01:27:35,260
I'm gonna I gotta breathe for a second here. Why am I using like the mini hot dog bun

314
01:27:35,260 --> 01:28:26,020
controllers? The hell? What? I'm so on tilt right now. Like you didn't just shake the

315
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:30,899
pinball machine. You took a hammer and just wound up and smashed into the middle of the

316
01:28:30,899 --> 01:28:51,619
glass and just started stealing components. There's really a fucking troll block right

317
01:28:51,619 --> 01:29:29,939
there too. Here comes the explosion. The spin doesn't work. Do I have to be big?

318
01:29:32,729 --> 01:29:38,329
Oh that stupid block. I'm not cut out for this. I'm not cut out for this.

319
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:17,050
All right I got a mushroom. I fucking forgot again. I'm not going down. Super goddamn expert

320
01:30:17,050 --> 01:30:49,430
give me a break. Fuck expert. Fuck this. Fuck the Oscars. What the hell is this for?

321
01:30:49,989 --> 01:31:14,810
There's gotta be a reason for that. Now watch out for this dickhead that flies from here.

322
01:31:14,810 --> 01:31:33,500
Okay I should just go immediately. What am I waiting for? I'm scared that thing's gonna

323
01:31:33,500 --> 01:32:12,579
pop out and kill me. That's what you have to do. Okay I'm just going right in. I'm just

324
01:32:12,579 --> 01:32:17,239
gonna go right into the bulb. Watch this. Ready? Just right in. Immediately. Go go go go go.

325
01:32:17,239 --> 01:32:36,819
No don't don't. What are you doing? Get the heart. Whatever the thing is. I did it.

326
01:32:38,539 --> 01:32:44,409
Now what? Now what's the rest of this? Movies movies. Hold on. Wait wait wait. Just wait wait

327
01:32:44,409 --> 01:33:05,020

328
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:24,380
expert level they'll download. I'm gonna be quiet. Can I even beat this anymore? I don't

329
01:33:24,380 --> 01:33:27,100
think this is not completable. I picked them all up. I didn't know that was what was gonna

330
01:33:27,100 --> 01:34:07,239
happen. Dick. Get hit by it. Come on. Get hit by that. What happened to the- what am I supposed

331
01:34:07,239 --> 01:34:24,470
to do? Just die. We're gonna- don't worry. The movie night's coming soon. Just hold on

332
01:34:24,470 --> 01:34:30,579
and let me beat this. I have to beat one super expert otherwise I'm- I have to download. Why

333
01:34:30,579 --> 01:34:36,979

334
01:34:36,979 --> 01:34:49,189
me? Those are all the word- that's that's the only word that's in my brain. I'm gonna

335
01:34:49,189 --> 01:34:53,430
have to download. You guys I will be careful guys. You guys- I don't want you- you guys

336
01:34:54,390 --> 01:35:05,560
I seriously I'm fucking so dumb that I- I've been hit by that every single time and I can't do it

337
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:27,079
because I need the mushroom. Hold on let me download. Don't get hit by the fucking thwomp.

338
01:35:27,079 --> 01:35:32,760
It just comes out of nowhere for no reason. It's only- it's only there to make you angry

339
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:39,500
and it's working. Don't be angry by this. It's- it's- it's working as intentional.

340
01:35:45,079 --> 01:36:02,779
He tricked us into watching him play Mario. No I didn't. I did not. Okay now I'm gonna do it.

341
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:08,630
I just need to leave the fire flowers out here. I just need one. I'm gonna get the one at the

342
01:36:08,630 --> 01:36:32,470
very end. Okay so I'm ready. Did that- what? It hits you? Excuse me Bowser. Please get the fuck

343
01:36:32,470 --> 01:36:43,880

345
01:37:48,119 --> 01:38:03,260
I did it. I beat a super expert level. Somebody owes me 50 grand. I mean now I gotta- I mean
