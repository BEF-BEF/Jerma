1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,269
All right, fun. That was Disney Infinity 3.0. I couldn't, I couldn't even get it to fucking turn on.

2
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:16,839
Um, okay, great. So now, uh, should I try Ultra Kill? I know they had the new update, right?

3
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:33,219
Does Steam Cloud work for this game? Because I'm gonna be in trouble if it doesn't.

4
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:36,740
Because I had to uninstall a bunch of stuff and I uninstalled Ultra Kill.

5
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:46,859
So hopefully it worked. I'm gonna be sad if I have to start over.

6
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:51,740
Dude, what is going on right now? Disney Infinity 3.0 broke my computer.

7
00:00:51,740 --> 00:01:03,399
These are all set the right way, right? I think so. I think we're good.

8
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:19,060
I gotta remember how to play though. There we go. All right, so we are, which one was I on?

9
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:45,540
5.1? Harmless lenient standard. I swear to God, Disney Infinity broke the computer.

10
00:01:45,540 --> 00:02:05,560
Standard, right? So Act 2? I did this. Layer 5. Wrath. Let's go.

11
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,780
Okay, so I gotta, how do you play? I gotta remember how to play the game. This is important.

12
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:28,219
All right, let's go. Act 2. How do you play? This is my favorite game. This game is sick.

13
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:34,020
I just gotta remember how to do everything. What are the buttons?

14
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:43,349
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Jump, dash, left shift, slide, left control, weapons. Okay.

15
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:58,949
Don't weapons have like powers too? Yep, you can dash in the air.

16
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:31,159
How am I going? Blue hook points act as slingshots. How do I grab that? R? Oh, okay, yep. Cool.

17
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:48,710
It's an underwater level. I already don't like it. Checkpoint.

18
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:56,729
Does not build up hard damage while underwater. Go nuts. Have fun.

19
00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:14,840
Oh yeah, I have the machine gun. You can get rid of all the bullets, right?

20
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:45,639
Underwater sounds make me want to puke. Okay, we good? Yeah, it's a new update.

21
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:55,910
This is all new. Whatever it is. So I can choose a few. Oh, thank God.

22
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:33,689
Shit. All right. Oh my God. You're, you're alive. Oh my goodness. I feel like I'm on drugs. What?

23
00:05:33,689 --> 00:06:38,439
Stop. How do I sink? Okay. No. Oh, I need sound. Dude, this is just proving to me just how much

24
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:46,980
audio is important for me when I play a game. I can't play. It's like, I can't see. You know

25
00:06:46,980 --> 00:07:32,540
what I mean? I can't see. I actually can't see. By the way, this is, this is, I don't want it there.

26
00:07:32,540 --> 00:08:05,980
Okay. Way better. I can actually use this now. I'm playing with no sound.

27
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:41,850
That's the only way I can do it. What is doing that? Why am I taking so much damage?

28
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:58,840
How do you heal? What's the, there's a heal? What's the heal? I haven't played so long.

29
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:14,100
How do you heal? Blood? You forgot everything. I've played like 150 games since I played this.

30
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:33,240
It's mouse four. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Change arm. Oh shit. Hold on. Weapons have

31
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:40,889
two modes. Oh, I have to think about this. Fuel is blood. You're all you have. Right, right, right.

32
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:58,580
Okay. Okay. Okay. What is change arm? Right. Okay. I have a punch. I want whiplash on mouse four.

33
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:04,779
Very right. Okay. You can switch these. I don't need to read what these do again

34
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:20,039
because this has a different mode too, right? Yeah. What mode did I like? I think I like the

35
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:31,669
shotgun. What's punch? House five. I'm going to make it like V or something, right? Maybe middle

36
00:10:31,669 --> 00:11:47,529
mouse. Okay. Let's try this. You play Madagascar too? Um, no. Shit. Oh, no. I fucking fell. Where

37
00:11:47,529 --> 00:12:01,669
am I? Oh, this is brutal. Floating around in the water is like, I can't think of a thing that I

38
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:49,110
would rather not do than this. I'm in trouble. Where is it? Where am I? I feel like I'm cooking

39
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:56,649
with like eight pans on a burner and they're all almost done. And I'm like, oh shit. Wait,

40
00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:00,409
hold on. Grab that switch and flip that. I got up with the patties done and everything's about to

41
00:13:00,409 --> 00:14:32,139
burn. Give me the health. I don't want to fucking float around. What are you doing? Um, die? I did

42
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:46,100
it. Did I do it? Thank God. Oh, how long am I in the water level for? Please say five minutes.

43
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:55,450
I hated the shit in Mario too. Every time it was a water level. I just, okay. Can one of my friends

44
00:14:55,450 --> 00:15:19,110
play for like an hour? God, I need the skull. All right. I guess I'm going to go this way. Wait,

45
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:35,929
there's a skull in there. Can I go back in here? Was there a skull in here? There was. Okay. How

46
00:15:35,929 --> 00:16:05,769
do I pick it up? You look like a carrot. Thanks. Is that a thank you? All right, let's go. Oh,

47
00:16:05,769 --> 00:17:18,230
I can breathe. Get out of here. What did I just do to myself? What happened? Oh, that's the special

48
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:32,859
move for that. That thing explodes in your hand. I forgot how it works. Hold on. How's it work?

49
00:17:32,859 --> 00:18:02,089
Okay. So if you do it more than once, one, two. Okay. One, two. Okay. I get it. What was this?

50
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:10,819
What was that? Secret? Ooh. What'd I get for that? Get me out of the fucking water. I hate water so

51
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:21,910
much. Dude, if I could drain every lake in every video game I've ever played, I would. I want water

52
00:18:21,910 --> 00:19:07,670
to be scenery, not a gameplay mechanic. I don't even know what is fucking happening right now.

53
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:44,549
You literally just played a fish game. Yeah, but I would have drained that lake. Shit. I got no

54
00:19:44,549 --> 00:20:01,579
health. Dude, am I crazy or is this like a hundred times harder than what I did last? Am I on the

55
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:08,059
wrong difficulty? I feel like this is unbelievably harder than it used to be. Am I playing on the

56
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:33,579
wrong difficulty? Skill issue. Dude, I don't know. Holy shit. All right. Come on. Let me get

57
00:20:33,900 --> 00:21:40,309
fucking, let me sit up a little. Bro. Oh, I need that fucking health. This guy's got to die

58
00:21:40,309 --> 00:22:25,910
immediately. I didn't mean to do that. Jesus Christ. What is happening? Who's shooting me with

59
00:22:25,910 --> 00:23:59,130
this stuff? Even throwing a coin? Dude. Oh yeah. Don't hit me. What the fuck is happening? No

60
00:23:59,130 --> 00:25:04,970
fucking way. Did that go through your legs? Oh, where'd he go? Holy shit. That was hard.

61
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:15,240
I didn't even know what was going on. I didn't know where I was. Holy shit. That was like omega

62
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:36,710
hard. Okay. So what? One more through here. Stop saying omega because it's omega weekend. Dude,

63
00:25:36,710 --> 00:26:00,869
that was omega hard, right? Where are you? There you are. Why am I here? Okay. Thank goodness.

64
00:26:00,869 --> 00:27:16,420
No checkpoint. Fucking water. Don't kill me. That was way, that was like nothing in comparison.

65
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:44,579
Okay. There's that checkpoint. I didn't get the points to the health of that.

66
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:59,240
Why? There's a parry too. I forgot. What's the parry?

67
00:28:42,089 --> 00:29:17,750
Interrupting sentries. Red arm. Oh, okay. That's right. Punch. Don't kick me. Oh,

68
00:29:17,750 --> 00:30:08,410
that was pretty sick. Hey, for anarchy. Anarchy. What the heck? I need that blood so bad.

69
00:30:13,660 --> 00:31:04,700
Whoa. Yikes. Oh, I did it. That was insane. That was actually insane.

70
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:21,220
Genuinely. That was ridiculous. That was, that was hard. Don't touch any water. How would you do

71
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:46,119
that? Don't touch water in the water level. Hold on. I need to read this. Okay. Coin to deflect.

72
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:57,779
One of them is a charge. Let me see. Let me play with it. Right. Okay. Yep. Okay. This next one,

73
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:08,359
the shotgun has a couple things. Overheat and launch the shotgun's core. Yep. Pump the shotgun.

74
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:14,940
Too many pumps will make it blow up. Okay. Nail gun. Let me see what these were.

75
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:19,559
Shoots the magnet. Okay. I know that. What does this one do?

76
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:28,150
Alt-fire while shooting to overheat. So it goes. Yep. Okay. Rail cannon. This is new.

77
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:36,680
Because this one is just boom. A piercing instant piercing shot.

78
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,079
Pierces through all enemies. Pay attention to your piercing position to maximize destruction

79
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:54,730
of piercing. Don't use it in water. Oh, okay. Why is the game so hard? Am I crazy or is this

80
00:32:54,730 --> 00:33:00,759
game way harder now? I was doing like 50% of my health every time I did that in the water.

81
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:12,819
Drill. Okay. All right. What is malicious? All right. Cool. Yeah. This game is sick. Let's go.

82
00:33:27,579 --> 00:33:38,039
Hold. Punch. Yep. Yes. So this is a, you go whack. I not do it now. How would this be?

83
00:33:39,000 --> 00:34:00,519
What do they make melee? Didn't I? Oh, I can't do it. All right. Let's do it. Five two. Okay.

84
00:34:01,160 --> 00:35:01,929
I looked at chat. My fault. That does not hurt. Oh, the game's crashed. Oh, no. It's asking me

85
00:35:01,929 --> 00:35:40,949
if I want to do sticky keys. Why does sticky keys exist? You know, in 2022, I really could not

86
00:35:40,949 --> 00:36:11,940
answer that. I have no idea. I don't know if it has to have some use. Don't fall. Shit. Sponge him.

87
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:36,329
I need to kill this thing very quickly. Where are you? Oh, my goodness. Oh,

88
00:36:38,329 --> 00:37:42,460
it's gone already. Oh, okay. If you kill me from all the way back there, I'll be very upset.

89
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:55,500
What the heck is wrong with you? How do I kill this? I have to run. I think idols can only be.

90
00:37:55,500 --> 00:39:13,829
Oh, now what? Oh, I can't open those. How do I break it? Oh, yikes. Oh, my. Oh, my God. These

91
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:57,719
guys are protected by the idols. How do I break? Oh, I guess throwing baseballs at me. I gotta get

92
00:39:57,719 --> 00:41:30,699
up there. Oh, it's so hard. Please die. No, turn into a fucking lawnmower. How do I? Oh, die.

93
00:41:30,699 --> 00:42:05,800
Die. Die. Sponsored stream. You lost your mind. I didn't make it. Sorry. I'll get it right now.

94
00:42:05,800 --> 00:43:14,179
It was red. Boy, I need red. Yo, yo, yo, yo. Oh, no, no. I want this thing.

95
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:37,400
Dude, there's no, there's no way. There's no way. You know what I mean? There's no way.

96
00:43:43,019 --> 00:43:49,030
I already put that there. OK, so that's horse shit. So I have to just get ready.

97
00:43:49,030 --> 00:44:38,039
Here we go. Ready? OK, go up here. Don't even think about it. Give me that. You piece of shit.

98
00:44:38,039 --> 00:45:08,679
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Slow down. Oh, yes. Thank God. All right. We're good.

99
00:45:08,840 --> 00:47:02,219
I had it. Harry, Harry. There's a different mode. Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, all Paris, all Paris

100
00:47:02,219 --> 00:49:17,019
and real gun. Hey, hey. Oh, what the fuck is going on here? How do I do this? What happened?

101
00:49:18,280 --> 00:50:11,219
What happened? I just want to hear the rain. Can you not parry the blue? How do you? How do

102
00:50:11,219 --> 00:50:39,429
you? I want to pair the blue. How do you parry blue? Use coins, use coins, use coins. Is it

103
00:50:39,750 --> 00:51:35,429
coins good against them? Pretty good. Come on. Get on the barrel. Get on the barrel. Get on the

104
00:51:35,429 --> 00:52:15,369
barrel. It shouldn't have been that tricky. Yeah. Why were you squished into the ground? How did I

105
00:52:15,369 --> 00:53:09,960
not hit you? Oh, I missed. See ya. Now what? You play IRL like my grandpa. Sorry. That guy was

106
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:27,269
crazy. Turn the music back on. Don't fight the ferryman. I just walk by. How do you not fight

107
00:53:27,269 --> 00:54:10,539
the ferryman? You could have paid him. Okay. How much is this? I'm almost at it. Should I buy it?

108
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:20,420
That wasn't even the boss boss. That was just the mini boss. I'm actually on the ship. You know,

109
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:28,630
I am so glad it was not just underwater. Thank God. This is like, I hate underwater levels. I

110
00:54:28,630 --> 00:55:03,429
just do. I'm so happy that it's not that. Everybody left. Okay. I'm going to get lost here. I guarantee

111
00:55:03,429 --> 00:56:13,079
it. Jerry. Jerry. What is? Where did you? I don't even know that guy spawned. You reflect triple

112
00:56:13,079 --> 00:57:42,469
combo. Ready? Hyper combo. Ready? No, no, no. Get out of my face. These things suck. Just give me the

113
00:57:43,369 --> 00:58:24,550
land cannon. I thought it was dead. Stop attacking. I hate these things so much. Oh my

114
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:36,809
God. Because they just so you can't, I can't like jump up, jump, jump. Nothing to grab onto.

115
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:17,849
Bounced off his skull. It bounced off of his skull. Explain that to me. I need an explanation.

116
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:33,579
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I got juggled. Oh my God. I wish there was a double jump.

117
01:00:33,579 --> 01:00:41,460
Please. I'll pay $50 for it. Make it $50 DLC. I'll buy it. Make it $50 DLC. I'll buy it tonight.

118
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:55,510
Use the hook. You can hook onto enemies. Why didn't anybody tell me that?

119
01:00:59,619 --> 01:03:06,730
What? No. Where am I? Where am I? All right. Come here, you piece of shit. Die. Shut up. Do not.

120
01:03:07,289 --> 01:04:35,699
Right? Yes. Being blocked. I think I'm winning. I think. This game is insane, dude. Seriously.

121
01:04:59,769 --> 01:06:49,239
What do you got? Oh, you line up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Huh? Where am I?

122
01:06:49,800 --> 01:07:30,869
What am I shooting at? Where is it? Oh, Jesus, dude. Where? Oh, what the fuck? You're alive?

123
01:07:30,869 --> 01:08:06,340
No. Hey, extra crispy on the menu tonight. I'm sorry. We're good. Where do I go from here?

124
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:27,189
Because I need a checkpoint. Where's the checkpoint? What is this? I need a checkpoint.

125
01:08:27,189 --> 01:08:50,380
Rocket launch. Direct hits cause explosions. Indirect hits will launch enemies. Does it have

126
01:08:50,380 --> 01:09:22,460
another mode or no? Okay. I can hurt myself with this. Air shots. That hurts. I get up there.

127
01:09:22,939 --> 01:09:39,380
Can I jump up there? I don't think so. I got it. Use the clock and then shoot it.

128
01:09:39,380 --> 01:10:04,229
It's probably slow motion. I would imagine. That's cool. Ooh. You know what game was so fun?

129
01:10:04,229 --> 01:10:35,380
Tribes. Tribes Ascend was so much fun. I wish I could play it. I guess I could play it, right?

130
01:10:35,380 --> 01:11:01,829
What is going on? Wait, what's it doing? Bro, it's Omega gaming weekend. Just play it already.

131
01:11:01,829 --> 01:11:44,390
Maybe. Maybe I'll do it. That's fun. Really cool addition. I like it a lot.

132
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:49,930
Not going to do that shit. I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm not going to fall for that. Not right now.

133
01:11:57,720 --> 01:13:35,939
This way? I forgot. All right. Let's go. I made it. All right. Nice. I can't believe Disney

134
01:13:35,939 --> 01:13:46,149
Infinity 3.0 didn't work. I'm very upset by that. Dude, I got a pretty good idea for what's coming

135
01:13:46,149 --> 01:15:39,720
up next. We'll have to see. Am I doing this right? Make it? Do I get a checkpoint? I can't buy it.

136
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:53,880
Oh, I can. That's a lot of money. What does it do? Mires an instant beam that causes a large

137
01:15:53,880 --> 01:16:17,210
explosion on impact similar to a certain familiar face. Holy shit. Okay. I can't. Oh,

138
01:16:17,210 --> 01:16:42,060
what's grabbed? I can't grab. Where's my grappling hook? Why can I not grab? R? No. Mouse 4. I didn't

139
01:16:42,060 --> 01:17:09,899
unequip it or something, did I? Whiplash. Mouse 4. Oh, that's weird. Wow. I didn't want to do that.

140
01:17:09,899 --> 01:18:06,680
Okay. What's the strategy here? I think I'm doing only cannon. I didn't hit one single fucking.

141
01:18:56,819 --> 01:19:37,560
Wow. Why am I jumping into it? I thought it's a jump rope. Where did I just go?

142
01:19:41,779 --> 01:19:50,060
No blood. Excuse me. What are you talking about? All right. First of all,

143
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:58,649
unequip all this stupid shit that I have on. Unequip this. Unequip this. Unequip this. Actually,

144
01:19:58,649 --> 01:20:07,850
keep that. No. No. Get rid of that. Yeah. Nail gun. Keep that equipped. Just this one. Actually,

145
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:18,550
no, that's fine. All the rail cannons and the rocket launcher. Okay. I don't want all this crap.

146
01:20:21,029 --> 01:20:37,479
I feel like I'm like cycling through weapons like an idiot. We're good. We're good. Good.

147
01:20:37,479 --> 01:20:57,500
Everybody settle down. It's doing it again. I can parry that. Why? I thought that was the shotgun.

148
01:21:18,939 --> 01:22:39,050
I need to heal. I'm in like lunge at me. What? What happened? It explodes. I tried to parry.

149
01:22:39,050 --> 01:23:36,409
I didn't do it. You can only parry with the blue arm. What was wrong with that? Blue flash

150
01:23:36,409 --> 01:23:51,000
means you can't parry. Oh, so why am I trying to parry? Who told me to do that? No. No blood.

151
01:23:51,000 --> 01:24:46,710
No blood. None of that blood got on me. That's pretty damn good against the loliathan.

152
01:24:46,710 --> 01:25:28,630
What am I doing? I'm going to stick in them. God damn it, man. Come on.

153
01:25:50,739 --> 01:27:26,619
I can parry the bullets, but that doesn't really help though. Huh? Where's the tail? Where's the

154
01:27:26,619 --> 01:27:59,500
tail? Is it dead? Oh, that was crazy. Damn. Damn. That was crazy. Crazy. Damn. That was crazy.

155
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:12,819
That's it, buddy. You're going in the drink. Voice actor? What do you mean I'm going in the

156
01:28:12,819 --> 01:28:19,380
drink? What does that mean? I don't want to go in the drink. How do I get out of here?

157
01:28:19,380 --> 01:29:00,090
I need more than that. Under 10 seconds. I'm at 6-1. Should I be concerned? You know what I'm saying?

158
01:29:00,090 --> 01:29:44,100
Cry for the weeper. Oh my God. I'm about to... I'm going to put the game on easy. Holy smokes.

159
01:29:44,100 --> 01:31:29,659
I got one. What the fuck? Oh. Holy shit. Got someone. This song goes hard. Is there even a

160
01:31:29,659 --> 01:32:00,470
song playing? Oh, do I have to write these? Okay, so now where do I go? This area is terrifying.

161
01:32:00,470 --> 01:32:33,899
Yikes. What? Just die. Kill me. Just kill me. What happened? Did I die? I don't understand.

162
01:32:33,899 --> 01:33:29,960
I don't know what happened. I guess I did it. Where's the place to put this? Stop it. Wait,

163
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:41,880
why am I locked out? Turn on the music? Music on. How come I can't get in here? I'm missing

164
01:33:41,880 --> 01:34:17,750
something here. Can I put it down? What did I do? This is the beginning of the game. You

165
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:27,800
accidentally do a speedrun strategy and you softlock the game. Wait, that sucks. If I re...

166
01:34:27,800 --> 01:35:14,020
Oh, shit. It's not that far. There it is. Oh, come on. Carry the shotgun bullets. That's right. I

167
01:35:14,020 --> 01:35:30,979
forgot. All right. The weapon combination that I have is really stupid, so I can't do it.

168
01:35:30,979 --> 01:35:41,380
I physically can't press the buttons because that's left click and middle mouse at the same time.

169
01:35:41,380 --> 01:35:46,789
So this is going to be hard to do. All right. Let's try this again, please.

170
01:35:47,510 --> 01:36:05,479
I guess I can do it. It's hard to do because I accidentally scroll the wheel. It still says

171
01:36:05,479 --> 01:36:15,640
Disney Infinity 3.0. Does it really? Are you serious? No, it doesn't. Come on. Don't do that

172
01:36:15,640 --> 01:37:40,199
to me right now. Where are you? It's doable. All right. Now what games we've played so far.

173
01:37:40,199 --> 01:38:21,800
We played Disney Infinity 3.0. That's it. Ow. Okay. Let's try this again and not screw it up.

174
01:38:29,060 --> 01:38:44,420
Okay. Here we go. So now I put this on the thing, right? What do I do? What do I take this?

175
01:38:47,020 --> 01:38:52,939
When you say go right, you have to understand that when I read go right, I don't know if I'm

176
01:38:52,939 --> 01:39:54,939
in the orientation. Downstairs. Music up. Okay. I'll do music up. What's this? Okay. What's that?

177
01:39:55,579 --> 01:40:02,420
Okay. Start it. Start the encounter. How do I start the encounter? How do I start the encounter?

178
01:40:04,979 --> 01:40:11,109
How do I start the... Just die. Just die. Just die. Just die. It's a waste.

179
01:40:40,789 --> 01:42:42,300
Geez. I didn't have enough things. You piece of shit. Just die. Oh my goodness. It's so many

180
01:42:42,300 --> 01:44:03,579
things on the screen. Delete that weapon. Come on. Respawn the things. All right. Don't give me this

181
01:44:03,579 --> 01:44:47,510
shit. Oh, where? Oh my God. I didn't... I don't want this weapon.

182
01:44:58,250 --> 01:45:08,180
Oh, what's that? Let me do it.

183
01:45:53,699 --> 01:45:57,699
This is like the moment of impact of a car accident. You know what I mean? This is like

184
01:45:58,420 --> 01:46:03,079
the moment of impact on a car accident. Just times a thousand. You know what I mean?

185
01:46:06,729 --> 01:47:00,380
Just like... Ready? Go. Give me the doubles. Give me the doubles. Come on. This is it.

186
01:47:01,100 --> 01:48:35,109
What's up? What happened? Don't you dare step back up. Hey. A checkpoint. I got to get a

187
01:48:35,109 --> 01:48:45,640
checkpoint. Is there a checkpoint in here? Where's there a checkpoint? I need a checkpoint right now.

188
01:48:46,279 --> 01:49:00,420
Is there a checkpoint anywhere? How are you still firing at me? Dude, you shouldn't be able to do

189
01:49:00,420 --> 01:49:53,899
that. Thank God. I need a checkpoint. Come on, dude. What is going on here?

190
01:50:08,949 --> 01:50:12,069
I'm doing a lot of screaming. I'm sorry. People are probably like annoyed by this by now.

191
01:50:18,939 --> 01:51:21,130
Come to me. Okay. What? Get a jump? Oh, shit. What the fuck? Dude, I don't know where to go.

192
01:51:21,130 --> 01:52:34,340
I'm tethered to that person. I don't... Why is it blocking that shit? Oh, no way. Dude. I'm going to

193
01:52:34,340 --> 01:53:42,630
watch the YouTube videos. I'm going to be eating this. Stop that. It's fucking cheating. Oh my

194
01:53:42,630 --> 01:55:11,180
fucking God. Oh, no. Please don't do it. Why does it explode so much in my face?

195
01:55:11,180 --> 01:55:14,380
Please.

196
01:55:22,789 --> 01:56:24,250
Is anybody alive? Who's alive? Who is alive? There's nobody left alive. Shoot a coin. That

197
01:56:24,250 --> 01:57:08,539
guy's dead. Oh my... Oh, my heart hurts. I thought I died. I thought... Did I die? Oh my God. I thought

198
01:57:08,539 --> 01:57:19,189
I went in the fucking lava and died. I was supposed to say no way. No fucking way. Oh my God. Wow.

199
01:57:19,189 --> 01:57:27,140
Wow. Wow. Wow. I thought it was instant kill. Oh my God. Get me out of here. Oh my God, guys.

200
01:57:28,220 --> 01:57:39,720
No fucking way. And this is 6-2 now. That's not even the end. I got to fight the boss.

201
01:57:40,439 --> 01:57:53,939
I'll turn it up for the final encounter.

202
01:58:13,020 --> 01:58:21,500
You've taken everything from the machine and now all the means is perfect hatred.

203
01:58:26,899 --> 01:59:10,229
Anakin, don't. Keep running for yourself. Is this where the Gugget is coming?

204
01:59:10,229 --> 01:59:35,819
Is this where the Gugget is coming? Yeah? All right, let's go. I'm not giving you a second.

205
01:59:38,140 --> 01:59:45,020
Break you apart. Splay the gore of your protein form across the stars. I will grind you down until

206
01:59:45,020 --> 01:59:51,979
the very spot you fly for mercy. My hands shall relish, ending you here and now.

207
02:00:03,640 --> 02:01:10,680
My God. I can't block. Oh. Jesus. No way. You can't be serious. This is so hard. This is so

208
02:01:10,680 --> 02:02:16,090
goddamn hard. What the fuck? Oh my goodness. Oh my God. Why am I getting that close?

209
02:02:54,260 --> 02:05:04,199
Shit. OK. You piece of shit. Oh my God. Damn it.

210
02:05:04,840 --> 02:07:39,850
No. What is going on? I panicked. This is so fucking ridiculous. Hey, it's this

211
02:07:39,850 --> 02:07:45,850
Omega gaming weekend, man. I got to play some more stuff. This is a fucking sick game and yeah.

212
02:08:33,260 --> 02:08:42,649
It's way too hard. It's just way too hard. It's way too hard. It's just too hard. It's just too

213
02:08:42,649 --> 02:08:46,729
hard. It's not going to happen. It's impossible. It's just it's like an unbeatable encounter where

214
02:08:46,729 --> 02:09:05,109
it's like you can't fucking do it or whatever. Get this stupid fucking thing off. This thing

215
02:09:05,109 --> 02:09:48,340
just hurts you. It's awful. Is this? Show me what you were made for.

216
02:09:56,779 --> 02:10:53,539
Just kill me. It's over. It's over. Just kill me. Kill me. He killed me in one hit.

217
02:10:54,180 --> 02:12:45,609
Oh, god damn it. He moves so fast. It's just like I parried it. Shoot him. When he teleports behind

218
02:12:45,609 --> 02:12:50,520
you, it's not even fair. That should remake the game. They should redo the whole game. Make the

219
02:12:50,520 --> 02:13:01,850
whole thing from scratch. The whole thing from scratch again. Is there a reason why it's OK?

220
02:13:02,810 --> 02:13:13,609
This is a problem. Changing my weapons as mouse scroll is fucking ruining everything

221
02:13:13,689 --> 02:13:25,930
because melee is mouse scroll click. So I'm like, I'm this boss is just OK. You want to play this

222
02:13:25,930 --> 02:13:33,689
game? All I feel like I'm doing is just putting my head just underwater and just screaming

223
02:13:33,689 --> 02:13:40,310
underwater and then lifting my head up. I feel like I'm just yelling underwater. I'm just going like

224
02:13:40,710 --> 02:14:05,989
That's all. This is it. That's the whole thing I'm doing. What do I want to change it to?

225
02:15:33,479 --> 02:15:43,029
You want to give it a try? If you think it's so funny, then come try it.

226
02:15:45,640 --> 02:15:53,350
Dave. We're sitting in the back. All of you. You too. Greg. Fuck you, Greg.

227
02:15:54,789 --> 02:15:59,430
I do a live show. I do a live video game show and only five people show up.

228
02:16:10,470 --> 02:16:51,979
I don't know what fucking time zone I'm in. When does he do the ding? When the fuck is the goddamn

229
02:16:51,979 --> 02:16:56,459
thing? When's the ding? He wins the ding. He's not going to do a ding now. All of a sudden,

230
02:16:57,100 --> 02:17:24,709
I don't feel like doing a ding anymore. Is that what I'm understanding? Where'd he go?

231
02:17:27,770 --> 02:17:34,170
Um, usually I want the devs to look at this. Usually he comes down and there's like a few

232
02:17:34,170 --> 02:17:39,770
seconds. I want the devs to take a look at that. I want the devs to take a look at that one.

233
02:17:42,040 --> 02:18:09,829
Something might have been wrong with that. I parried it. I'm not playing this game anymore.

234
02:18:09,909 --> 02:19:06,219
I'm done. Dude, I can't even tell. Get the shotgun. I don't want to. Wrong arm. Well,

235
02:19:06,219 --> 02:20:33,190
why is it doing that? I don't understand. You. Okay. That's my time. That's my time.

236
02:20:33,190 --> 02:20:36,840
That's my time. That's my time. I need to do it.

237
02:20:36,840 --> 02:20:58,649
I'm the taste of victory. Yeah. This tastes. Is this my blood?

238
02:21:00,250 --> 02:21:11,209
I've never known such a relief. I need some time to think. We will meet again, machine.

239
02:21:11,209 --> 02:22:11,379
55 restarts holy shit into the ceiling how does that work is it gonna be is

240
02:22:11,379 --> 02:22:27,350
there enough more to act to later or is there more to act to there's a lot you

241
02:22:27,350 --> 02:22:42,360
missed so is the game feature complete at this point I guess I could just read

242
02:22:42,360 --> 02:22:52,399
the ending cutscene is that okay I beat the thing and I'm asking you it's

243
02:22:52,399 --> 02:22:58,229
answering the question right now it's like guys so can you guys anybody tell

244
02:22:58,229 --> 02:23:00,790
me if there's something that's on the screen as can you tell me what happens

245
02:23:00,790 --> 02:24:04,620
at the end okay let me read this pieces never fit because your light is sword

246
02:24:04,620 --> 02:25:07,840
and fire wait what this is me I'm reading I'm not pretending how to read

247
02:25:07,840 --> 02:25:55,340
I know how to just I'm just taking it in it's funny when I try to look up where

248
02:25:55,340 --> 02:26:14,079
you are is right there next to the camera so just hurts so Gabriel comes

249

next forever okay now it's time for the part of the stream where I go full cam

252
02:27:22,040 --> 02:27:33,829
and pretend like I'm doing a movie watch along like Amazon Prime or something you

253
02:27:33,829 --> 02:27:37,290
know if you find it funny if I just set that full screen and pretend like I'm

254
02:27:37,290 --> 02:27:51,370
reacting to a movie that's not here well actually you know what let's save this

255
02:27:51,370 --> 02:27:58,979
let's save this let's I want to start with this tomorrow I'm not the stream

256
02:27:58,979 --> 02:28:03,500
still going but I want to like get popcorn and shit and snacks and pretend

257
02:28:03,500 --> 02:28:07,899
like full cam I'm watching a movie and it's like oh yeah you can for legal

258
02:28:07,899 --> 02:28:10,579
reasons I can't put it on the stream but it's like you can queue it up with me

259
02:28:10,579 --> 02:28:19,440
and I'm gonna I'll do it I'll do it for like fucking 30 straight minutes what

260
02:28:19,440 --> 02:28:21,959
movie should it be and I'm just pretending to react to stuff that

261
02:28:21,959 --> 02:28:36,579
happens in it that's gonna be so hard jaws to the Incredibles I actually have

262
02:28:36,579 --> 02:28:41,399
no I've never seen the incredible start to finish I have no idea what happens

263
02:28:41,399 --> 02:28:45,649
and then if you actually took that and like cute it up with the movie that I

264
02:28:45,649 --> 02:28:52,250
said it was it might be actually kind of a funny watch along I've never seen the

265
02:28:52,250 --> 02:28:56,190
incredible start to finish all right that was cool that was a very hard that

266
02:28:56,190 --> 02:29:02,049
was awful in a good way I don't mean the game awful I mean it was just very hard

267
02:29:02,049 --> 02:29:07,620
