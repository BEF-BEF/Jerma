1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:13,130
Okay, welcome to the stream. I hope you all had a good couple last days. My name's Jerma.

2
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:20,739
If you've never been here before, uh, welcome to the stream. Today we're gonna do some Dreamcast

3
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:28,250
and by do, I mean, probably finish the Dreamcast. I noticed my voice today, it's very low and

4
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:33,609
booming. I've been taking my booming voice supplements, I've been taking my vocal

5
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:47,670
supplements. So now I can do a radio commercial for a jewelry store. Ah, they give real bad diarrhea

6
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,060
though. I wouldn't recommend taking them. Anywho, we got a couple of announcements to make today.

7
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:59,670
Something that's been for a long time coming. Should have been here a long time ago,

8
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:14,730
but it's here now. And of course, what I mean is T-shirts! T-shirts! There's only one new one,

9
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:19,849
but these will be available forever. And I want to give just a quick little sneak peek of what

10
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:24,090
I am talking about here. So, uh, don't look at that! You're not supposed to see that yet.

11
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,280
So, uh, one of the ideas I had for a shirt, I thought it would be really, really cool,

12
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:38,859
uh, because I'm such a huge fan of Star Wars, right? So why not make my own Star

13
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:45,859
Wars shirt? I love Luke Skywalker, I love Darth Vader, so figured I was gonna have my own

14
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:54,219
version of a Star Wars shirt and here we are. This is the one. It's Darth Vader in front of a

15
00:01:54,219 --> 00:02:01,219
fireplace for Christmas time. You know? Look, you understand? And I think you're gonna, I think

16
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:04,900
your friends are gonna laugh at this. I didn't make this though. This shirt has nothing to do

17
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,780
with me. I just think you should, like, get it. But this is what I meant by, like, T-shirt.

18
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:16,419
We're talking about, like, T-shirt day. See? I had nothing to do with any of this. But,

19
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:20,180
like, you and your friends might think it's funny, so you should, like, maybe get one.

20
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:34,280
Alright, let's show the real one! Here it is. So halfway through that, I just realized I could

21
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,759
have just been sued by Disney. So I kind of panicked and, uh, and stopped that immediately,

22
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:44,090
because that, that's not a lawsuit that I actually want. I realized that about halfway

23
00:02:44,090 --> 00:03:04,360
through that joke. So here is what you can buy starting today and, uh, lasting forever.

24
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:14,810
Here it is. I think I just crashed my OBS. Holy shit. I just crashed OBS because I tried

25
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:26,550
to load this. Are we still here? Hello? I just overloaded OBS. Well, uh, alright. Anyway,

26
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:35,139
um, the whole stream just almost went down. I almost just broke my computer.

27
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:42,069
If you do exclamation point shirts, or if you just go to teespring.com slash store slash

28
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:50,650
germa985, uh, glue man is back in multiple colors, in multiple cuts, and the night sky is

29
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:57,819
the new shirt. I wish, I don't know why I just did this. Bear with me for a second while I try

30
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:17,300
to figure out what the hell that was. I just, uh, there we are, okay. Um, I think I have to,

31
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,180
alright, I'm gonna have to make this my, like, desktop background for some reason.

32
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:26,490
Why did this have to happen? The night sky is, uh, literally what happens when you look

33
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:41,370
through a telescope. Really? My computer. I actually can't, I'm just gonna make it my

34
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,209
fucking desktop because, like, this is, I don't know why this won't, this just won't work.

35
00:04:48,379 --> 00:05:03,610
I can't open my file anymore. Oh, that's interesting. Anyways, restart computer. I can.

36
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:12,490
Where the fuck? Alright, I think my, like, computer just got electrocuted because, like,

37
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:19,319
I dropped, like, a thousand frames and it said overloading CPU and now I can't open files.

38
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:35,420
Why? Because I, what the fuck? Alright, well anyways, we're gonna play crazy taxi tonight.

39
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:40,550
Okay, I'm getting a lot of community subs here. Let me, this really just threw me off.

40
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:45,269
I have no fucking idea why this happened. I was gonna, like, show the image on screen

41
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:52,180
and it, my, my computer was electrocuted. Here. Let's just do, fucking, who cares? Fuck this.

42
00:05:52,180 --> 00:06:02,459
Ready? Here we go. Uh, well, let me do this first because I want people to see what it

43
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:07,990
actually looks like. So this is an old one. This is the glue man shirt. This is what

44
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,730
you can expect. There are multiple colors now, though. There's, like, three or four colors,

45
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:19,610
so that's really cool. Uh, I don't think it's the exact same t-shirt, though. I believe

46
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,050
they no longer have these, like, American, American apparel doesn't exist anymore, right?

47
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:30,470
So I think it's next level tees. It's the highest goddamn quality I could possibly fucking

48
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,829
select and that's not even true either, but it was one, it was one of the highest quality

49
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:40,170
shirts I could buy to have them put on. It's like their premium t-shirt, whatever that

50
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:46,259
means. But, uh, that's what it looks like. I don't even know what color this is. This is,

51
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:52,420
like, that navy blue, maybe? All these were made, the, all the designs, both of them were

52
00:06:52,420 --> 00:07:03,110
made by Ashley, so her link is in those descriptions. Name, name lag? Name lag? What's

53
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:23,959
name lag? Name lag? I didn't know! I didn't, we had it mirrored last time. That's what it

54
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:27,480
looks like. This is the shirt you're getting. This is, well, this is not the exact shirt,

55
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,810
but it's very close and they're available permanently. These are never, I'm not gonna,

56
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,569
I'm not gonna take these off. The Glueman shirt, the Night Sky shirt, they are both gonna be

57
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:42,579
available permanently, forever. That's a storefront. I can put other shit on that storefront.

58
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:46,259
Fucking Disney, don't even look at this shirt. You know, this is not even mine. That was a

59
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:51,300
joke I made. I want to reiterate that. That was just a comedy piece. Anyways, forever. I'm

60
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,379
not taking them down for any reason. They're always gonna be $20. Just, if you want one,

61
00:07:55,939 --> 00:08:00,339
thank you. I hope you like the way it looks. And now we're gonna play Crazy Taxi and some

62
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:06,600
more Dreamcast shit. I want to fucking show this on, why can I not open files?

63
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:22,949
It worked like 35 minutes ago. Can you make hats? I can make a lot of shit in that store.

64
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:32,220
It's, there's a bunch of random storefronts and accessories and iPhone cases and there's a

65
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:41,700
lot of, you can do a lot. Please, I'm gonna try, I'm gonna try one last fucking thing

66
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,299
because this is like a big deal. I haven't had a new shirt in like three or four years.

67
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:54,899
So let me just get this fucking situated because this is fucking dumb. I think I got it. Come on.

68
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:04,460
Come on. Yeah, I had to do a little bit of, I had to doctor a little bit of shit but I got it.

69
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:17,019
Okay, let's go over this shirt because I've seen a lot of people asking about what the

70
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:26,120
hell, what the heck is this? I haven't even seen it yet. There it is. Look at that, finally.

71
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:38,549
Hey, it only took up like fucking two years. Here is the night sky. This is the new shirt.

72
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:46,580
Just a father and son exploring the outdoors together, taking a look through the telescope.

73
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:56,500
Clear, beautiful. This is, at any point where you are right now, this is what you will see

74
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:07,659
when you look up. It's just, you know, me and my dad. Why can they see the earth?

75
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:31,700
What are you talking about? I mean, just, yeah. I mean, where are they in this scenario?

76
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:39,419
You know what I mean? That's the best part. Where are they? What fucking planet are you on?

77
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,139
No, this is father and son looking at the night sky through a telescope.

78
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:58,009
Okay, no Saturn. No, Saturn wasn't popular enough to be on the shirt. Sorry.

79
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:10,460
Only the popular planets get to fit on the t-shirt. If you understand, design choice wise,

80
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:20,759
unpopular planets can't fit on t-shirt. So that's how science works. If the planet's

81
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:29,240
not popular, they're just fucking delete it. They don't care. Yeah, that means that they're

82
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:36,100
on one of those planets. And guys, Saturn and Mercury, they could, they could be behind that.

83
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,480
They're behind there somewhere. See the moon? The moon's very large.

84
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:44,919
Bigger than the sun. So of course that, like, Mercury could probably be behind the moon.

85
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:48,820
This is just what's available from this National Geographic Photographer's angle.

86
00:11:49,460 --> 00:12:04,759
Why do they need a telescope if the planet's that big? Because you want to make,

87
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:14,039
you want to see what's on the fucking surface. And how do you know that? We don't know where this

88
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:25,269
photo could be taken from. What do you want to see the crevices? You want to, like,

89
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:37,659
what's behind the moon? What's, where are the asteroids? But all jokes aside, this is,

90
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:45,029
I love this design. I think it's great. I think it'll look good on, on any chest.

91
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:58,490
It's a lovely, lovely, lovely t-shirt. Yeah, like you guys could be looking through

92
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:03,929
the telescope. Right? This is, this is potentially two or three different angles

93
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:14,039
melded together in a beautiful fucking incredible design. Don't you understand? That's you

94
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:27,139
looking through that scope. Don't you get it? But I have to thank, again, this is Ashley

95
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:35,690
for the incredible artwork and realizing half the dumb shit that I said to her. That's really,

96
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,409
really fantastic. Thank you so much. It looks great. And you all know what the Glooman

97
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:52,309
one looks like, but this is the new one. This shirt is only available in black for very obvious

98
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:57,029
reasons because it's supposed to, the father and son in the telescope are supposed to be

99
00:13:57,029 --> 00:14:02,789
silhouettes. So putting, you know, that wouldn't really look okay on, like, a green shirt.

100
00:14:03,669 --> 00:14:11,350
So black is the only available color here. The site says only available for three days.

101
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:17,450
Uh, that's, that's not, no way. That's not true. I don't know why it's saying that,

102
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:27,509
but I have it set to, I have it set to permanently be available. Only available for three days.

103
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:39,929
Now that's, I have like a storefront. Let me, let me just make sure. So they're printing

104
00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:47,059
in three days. So what, how Teespring works is every three days orders get printed and

105
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:52,059
shipped out. So I don't know why it says available for three days, but that's just how

106
00:14:52,059 --> 00:15:02,120
they print. So if you order your shirt today, you know, three days from now, all the ones that

107
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,980
were ordered in the last three days are going to print and then it'll start over again.

108
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:11,320
And it takes probably like a week or so, maybe a little bit more depending on where you live

109
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,840
to get there. But we'll see. Hopefully they turn out good. The last time I used Teespring,

110
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,190
the shirt came out good and I didn't change anything really. So let's hope that they look

111
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:27,299
as good and wear as good as the Glooman shirts did a few years ago. Anyways, uh,

112
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:35,269
we're going to move on. If you want to buy one, they're there. And, uh, we're going to move on

113
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:47,720
and play crazy taxi and move on to like Sega bass fishing and maybe a little bit of a jet

114
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:57,639
grind radio was the link to the store. If you just do, uh, exclamation point shirts,

115
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,639
it'll pop up. It's a Teespring storefront. You just kind of click on whatever you want.

116
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:09,080
Uh, I added, I can only make sure I said I added a cut. I added a, another cut for

117
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,779
the Glooman shirt. So there's like a women's tee. There's like a unisex tee. There's a couple of

118
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:22,820
them. I didn't do it yet for the night sky yet because I figured I'd just let just the t-shirt

119
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:31,100
be exist for what, like for now, I guess. Oh, this, the shirts have sold out and I'm like,

120
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:40,759
God, make a dress. I can't do that. But anyways, thank you. It's been a long time coming.

121
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:47,179
Uh, I know a lot of people have been looking forward to that and so have I.

122
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:57,980
It's good that it's, uh, finally available. So let's start crazy taxi and, uh, kind of put

123
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,779
a cap on the Dreamcast stuff. Maybe not. I say that, but there's like still Shenmue

124
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:08,500
and like Shenmue. In my opinion, that's not Dreamcast stuff, though. Shenmue is not like

125
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:16,519
the Dreamcast stuff because, you know, it's not, it is Dreamcast, but it's not because

126
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:20,359
it's coming out on PC now. It's Shenmue 3 is coming out in like a few months or something.

127
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:31,349
Isn't it? Okay. Let me make sure this works. It does. I'm getting my controller.

128
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:38,619
Seaman. Yeah, I'm still, I know. And I still can play Seaman. I'm going to just load that

129
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:47,910
up one day for fun. You will see Seaman. I promise. I just kind of got fucked over

130
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:55,259
in the packaging. Somebody sent me the just disc and no microphone. So that sucked,

131
00:17:56,059 --> 00:18:03,029
but let's go. Thank you for joining me. Joining me. I'm going to turn the lights on in here.

132
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,579
So crazy taxi is a game where you drive around in a taxi and it's fucking crazy.

133
00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:23,369
Best description. I could probably get it. So how do you play this? You just drive people

134
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:37,369
around, right? They got arcade, original, uh, crazy box. What is crazy box? You can do arcade,

135
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:46,660
right? That makes the most sense. Arcade play by play, play by arcade rules. Work for three

136
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:54,380
minutes, work for five minutes. Just go arcade rules. The box, the box, the box. Let me just

137
00:18:54,380 --> 00:19:03,349
remember how to play. Go ahead and pick a car and driver. All right. Let's see.

138
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:09,619
I'm going to be open shirt. Okay. Let's have some fun.

139
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,420
All right. So how do you drive?

140
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:28,700
Cable car stop top. It's probably kind of loud, but sorry. Whoa, the,

141
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:47,380
the analog, the analog is very sensitive. You know, it's also very loud. I'm in 99th place.

142
00:19:52,019 --> 00:20:00,069
978 miles. Um, why did it reverse the controls? Um, right trigger. Why is it doing this?

143
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:10,700
I, what happened? Oh, right. Okay. I can, I have to set it. I have to set the gear.

144
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:39,859
Six bucks for the jump. I can't even fucking focus. All right. Get out. I can't drive on

145
00:20:39,859 --> 00:20:52,809
the beach. Why? Hold on a minute. This is important. This shit is loud. I'm going to

146
00:20:52,809 --> 00:21:10,779
turn the music up and the sounds down. This is hurting my brain. Let's go get in. I was

147
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:47,640
going to go very close, very close. Go get out. That was my practice. That was my practice.

148
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:55,829
692 bucks for two customers. Are you sure you don't want to register?

149
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:02,549
I don't want to register. No. Stop popping up every time I log into your website to ask

150
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:06,869
me if I want to register for updates. No, I don't want push notifications. I don't want you to

151
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:25,059
email me fucking flyers. No, I only do that again. Excellent. Now I'm ready to get this

152
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:29,859
going. Let's try to get like a thousand dollars at least. Yep. Same. I'm picking up

153
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:49,660
the same exact person that I picked up last time. Descent. Get out. Speedy. Speedy. All

154
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:57,579
right. All right. Go through the chain link fence. All right. This is big money right here.

155
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:10,440
Yacht harbors. This is 1.2 kilometers. All right. I got to get some air here.

156
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:31,190
250. Good tip. Four dollars. Good tip. Park. What are you guys doing? Just parking the

157
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:59,289
road. It's the same like SUV. Yo. Speedy. Who's next? Yellow. Get him. That was a pretty nice

158
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:24,420
maneuver. That's not a... Can we get out of the car? Whoa. What the fuck? Get out. Made it

159
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:35,640
over a thousand dollars, right? Good. PC Ford. Alexa. What? Can I pick up more than one

160
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:56,900
person? I forget. Excuse me. Excuse me. PC Ford. Yeah. Well, here's the thing, though,

161
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:04,150
guys. Right? This is available. Go. What the fuck are you doing? This is available on Dreamcast,

162
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:09,670
but the PC port was like six bucks or something, and the actual Dreamcast version

163
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:19,609
at lower resolution is, I believe, like at least 30 to 40 dollars. It's something like

164
00:25:19,609 --> 00:25:31,000
that. Come on. Look at me. Look. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Over 1600. Come on. Last one. Come on.

165
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:45,769
Three, two, one. Get out. Ah, that's not gonna be bad. That's what I currently have.

166
00:25:51,769 --> 00:26:04,119
Really? That wasn't good. I thought that was okay. No, what about original? play by

167
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:19,589
arcade rules in original. Let's do uh, I'm gonna try every person. Fuck off, I want the big money.

168
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:43,099
This is a $400 affair. $1.50. $2.00. $4.00. Ooh, near miss. A head-on crash got me 50 cents.

169
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:04,150
Get out! Watch out, out, out, out, out, out, out. All right, I gotta turn him around, right?

170
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:23,819
I'm thinking, I'm thinking of going down. Down or is it? I think it is this way. I was

171
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:30,779
thinking I could go up a few jumps to make some more money. Actually, it kind of worked.

172
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:58,299
I thought I could go off like a jump going down. Apparently not. There's too many sounds. There

173
00:27:58,299 --> 00:28:08,339
are a lot of sounds, you're right. I need two grand. I just don't get in car accidents. I say

174
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:18,039
you get more tips. Like that. Oh, that would have been... What is under the car? What's

175
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:22,220
going on? Why am I popping up and down like this? What's wrong with my car?

176
00:28:23,019 --> 00:29:01,099
Fuck you. Right here. All right, I got more than I had last time. This is a quick one. Near crash.

177
00:29:01,819 --> 00:29:05,240
There it is. Gotta drive on the wrong side of the road to make this money.

178
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:27,059
Nice. That wasn't bad. I immediately picked one up. Okay, good. Turn around. Same deal.

179
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:39,960
Oncoming traffic. Weave. Ooh! Ooh! Oh, don't ever tell me I've never fucking played this

180
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:49,220
game before because I haven't. I did like once. There we go. I better get like a class

181
00:29:49,220 --> 00:30:04,980
B license for this. All right, I need something. Come on, get in there. Landing here. I'm gonna

182
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:15,259
say bang of right. No, left. We park. Oh, look at this jump. Come on. Do I have enough

183
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:28,420
strength? Apparently. Apparently. All right, we're still fine. Everything's just good.

184
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:32,579
We're just... We got hit by a fucking train. I don't think this is the way to play through

185
00:30:32,579 --> 00:31:05,609
that. Oh! That wasn't bad. God damn it. This game's too addicting. I might as well do

186
00:31:05,609 --> 00:31:13,930
AAA. Is it too loud? Should I turn it down? Or is it just good enough? Original. I can

187
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:26,740
do this. Play off by arcade rules. Good. All right, let's do, uh, China. What was

188
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:35,240
it? 2600 was my best one? I need to get like over three grand. Clean. Let's go.

189
00:31:36,200 --> 00:32:11,180
Stop. Ah! That was a lot of tips though. That was so many dips. That was so many dips.

190
00:32:13,819 --> 00:32:23,720
All right, let's pull this one back. North camp station. Come on, Gina. What the

191
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,880
hell was that? I got plenty of time. Don't worry. I'm gonna get a class B license.

192
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:43,799
I'm gonna clean this up. We're gonna get it. Over the hill. Nice. Nice. Come on,

193
00:32:43,880 --> 00:33:02,500
I need some more of that. Nice. Come on. More tips. Oh! It's right there. Go through. Go

194
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:29,670
through. No! Beat the train! At least it's not gonna be very good. Class E gamer. I'm

195
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:41,769
gonna get at least class B before I change to a different game. Watch this one. Holy shit,

196
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:53,160
Germ. I didn't think you could do that. Yeah. Dude, I played this game all day,

197
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:57,880
years ago, and I still play it. And I didn't even know that was a possible jump scenario.

198
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:37,539
Get in. In. Straight away. It's not straight away. It was that way. Oh! I got it! Anybody in

199
00:34:37,539 --> 00:34:51,849
here? Is that somebody? This game's fucking fun. Still. That was not even good. I can do

200
00:34:51,849 --> 00:35:11,659
better than that. Whoa. Don't crash on me. Don't crash on me. Class C streamer. Don't

201
00:35:11,659 --> 00:35:19,000
worry. I'm not allowed. All right. So who did I like the most? Probably Beedie. I think I made

202
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:37,449
the most money with Beedie. Go expensive first. Wave Beach. I want at least $200 in tips.

203
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:55,940
Count it. That's not a tip? How? You really threw me off with that no tip, dude.

204
00:36:03,289 --> 00:36:22,599
Air. Come on. Air. I need air. I did actually turn. How did I go the wrong way?

205
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:26,409
Are you serious? No. Do it again.

206
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:42,780
I thought I had the... I thought I cut it the right direction. What the fuck was the arrow doing?

207
00:36:42,780 --> 00:37:05,349
What the hell was that? Come on, man. Jump to car. Good. Ten bucks. Come on. More. More tips.

208
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:18,250
That was the best I possibly could have done that. Right here. Pizza parlor. This is far

209
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:37,500
away. Drive. Nice. Good cut. Good cut. You've got a cut than that. Like that one. That was

210
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:57,860
still a pretty good cut. Right here. Got another person immediately. Big bits. $50.

211
00:37:58,739 --> 00:38:04,280
Holy shit. Miniclips. Thanks for the 50 bucks. They say slow. Wait, wait, wait. Hey,

212
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,739
Jerma, keep up the good work and never stop being speedy. Thank you, Miniclips. Thank you

213
00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:16,650
for the 50 bucks. 5,000 bits. It means a lot. Thank you so much. I'm going to be fast.

214
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:28,949
It's a shitload of money. All right, Miniclips. I gotta, I gotta, I gotta make at least $50 in tips.

215
00:38:33,429 --> 00:38:49,659
Oh fuck. It's too ridiculous. Jesus. All right. I didn't make $50 in tips. It's okay. Anybody

216
00:38:49,659 --> 00:39:02,059
around here that I can pick up? I need them right now. You. The Millennium Tower. I need

217
00:39:02,059 --> 00:39:21,079
to make three grand at least. But I need to jump. Any jumps around here? Shit! It's all

218
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:29,260
right. It's okay. Just build up tips. Cut it. Okay. We're good. It's the Millennium Tower

219
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:48,570
right here. Let's go. Get in. Okay. This is going to take us out. Where the hell am I? How do

220
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:56,539
I get out of here? What was the last? The highest I've ever had was 26. I did the same

221
00:39:56,539 --> 00:40:11,369
thing last time. Oh fuck. I made it. Okay. I need another fair. Where? There! This way.

222
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:29,960
All right. Grand Mercury Hotel. Don't do this to me, game. Come on. Get out of my fucking

223
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:51,860
way. Too many cars. Holy shit. Got it. Somebody else? Is there any other fair? Go! Yes!

224
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:05,800
Hurry, hurry, hurry. Back to the Millennium Tower. That guy just crashed into me. What a dick.

225
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:33,880
Millennium Tower. No. Oh fuck. No.

226
00:41:42,099 --> 00:42:10,170
Crazy box. Crazy box. Jump past the K point. Stunt challenge mode.

227
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:25,829
How do you do this without? What did I do wrong?

228
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:33,429
Is there like a super mode?

229
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:54,340
There's a speed boost. How do you do that? Pushing in the sticks.

230
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:00,780
X, Y. That's the horn. That's going. That's reverse. That's.

231
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:14,650
Press the gas right when you shift. Okay. There we go. That would save so much time if I did

232
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:28,579
that in any of the actual game. That would save so much time. Okay. Cool. So that's. You have to

233
00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:34,340
be in reverse and then go into gas. Go into front. Perform crazy drifts to earn a minimum 15 combo

234
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:39,619
within the time limit. Crazy. So we're learning. We're learning the ropes here. How do you do

235
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:48,019
a crazy drift? Just hold on the brake? Is there like another combination of buttons I don't know

236
00:43:48,019 --> 00:44:10,119
how to do here? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay. How am I doing that? This is so many more

237
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:21,750
ways to get tips that I wasn't doing. How did I just do that? I think it's hold. Okay. So

238
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:26,070
it looks like you go into reverse and then immediately into drive while you're turning.

239
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:36,739
No. No. So you hit both of them at the same time. Okay. So you have to do

240
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:45,380
reverse and drive at the same time. That's how you do it. All right. So I'll get it this time.

241
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:55,429
Press start. What do you mean? Like options? Like controls?

242
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:09,510
That doesn't. Brake horn. Confirm destination. Gear. Drive. Reverse. Yeah. So. I just got baited.

243
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:12,949
All right. Sorry. I got it. I figured it out. All right. We need.

244
00:45:14,309 --> 00:45:40,809
So I need to get a 15 combo. Shouldn't be too hard. Press start. That was apparently too hard.

245
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:50,550
Let's give it another go. Ready? Try it again. I think. Let me go faster. Let me see. How long

246
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:56,820
can I hold it for? Can I like go across the hole? Can I just drift across the whole thing?

247
00:45:57,619 --> 00:46:02,380
I guess it's like five or six that you can actually add it up to.

248
00:46:11,659 --> 00:46:18,139
You can actually control it. Yeah, you can control it while you're turning.

249
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:28,230
Take all the customers to their destination within the time limit.

250
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:40,730
Let's go. 109 seconds. Advice is the start button.

251
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:59,340
You're talking about like at the menu. Not like in game. Why did I just lose time?

252
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:36,840
What? Oh, you're over here this time. Okay. I gotta get used to that.

253
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:45,539
It's weird to hit that brake like that. Have to hit both buttons at the same time.

254
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:51,769
I'm gonna have you. It's A and B together to do that. It's kind of awkward.

255
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:20,300
What the fuck? Why? 56 seconds. Am I insane? Did that just say 109 seconds?

256
00:48:29,739 --> 00:48:39,690
Oh, it was a minute. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. All right. I mean that's click.

257
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:43,929
Why not just say 60? So that's one minute and nine seconds.

258
00:48:51,989 --> 00:49:10,710
Count up. 590. Well, I mean it doesn't say why in all three numbers the first one should be large

259
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:24,840
and the second two should be small. God damn it. I'm trying to. Why do I go faster when you

260
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:45,659
do a brake? E-brake like that. You like drift and go so fast. Welcome to crazy taxi.

261
00:49:45,659 --> 00:49:55,219
I'm just gonna brake normally. I could get it if I did. I'm gonna do it again. Let's do it again.

262
00:49:56,179 --> 00:50:17,989
It's time to get it. Go, go, go. What the fuck? Oh, why?

263
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:33,260
You have to. That's annoying. It is. All right. So let me explain something here. You have to

264
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:38,460
press reverse and drive at the same time. So when you do that, when you take your finger

265
00:50:38,460 --> 00:51:00,820
off, sometimes you're just in reverse. He's making excuses. You can call whatever you want.

266
00:51:01,699 --> 00:51:06,710
I'm just trying to get that down because it's hard to do that.

267
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:52,619
Oh my god. You have to start that drift to turn around in the middle of the road like 150 feet

268
00:51:52,619 --> 00:52:15,659
away at least. Let me try that. I'm not even gonna do it. Just do it. Just like drop them off

269
00:52:16,380 --> 00:53:15,159
because you got to complete stop. Turn. Shit. No, I'm not gonna get it. Doing it in the wrong

270
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:27,260
order. It's fucking crazy. That's ridiculous. How do you control that? That's insane. Wrong order?

271
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:41,719
Like aren't they the same distance away from each other? All right, isn't it all the same

272
00:53:41,719 --> 00:54:03,190
distance? Oh my lord. Wrong order of missions. Let me try something. That's fucking crazy. Oh

273
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:36,489
my god. How would you ever time that correctly? Get me out of here. Wait, hold on. So you

274
00:54:36,489 --> 00:54:45,320
tell me that I have to do this like Demon's Souls wise? If 3-1 is harder than 1-2. 3-1 is

275
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:57,500
harder than like 2-2. Oh, I thought this was just kind of... all right. So I like wasn't supposed

276
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:10,440
to do 3-1 until I knew how to do the other things. It goes down like this. I thought it

277
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:32,139
was 1-1-2. All right, can't you just call it 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9? What the hell was it supposed to do here?

278
00:55:33,019 --> 00:55:45,940
Run over the flag behind the car within the time limit to execute it. So shift into reverse,

279
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:58,579
shift into drive to do a crazy drift. There's a flag behind me. Okay, so...

280
00:56:00,179 --> 00:56:10,980
Okay, what? I didn't even need to... no, that was... you want me to drift and then...

281
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:34,500
I thought there was like a flag behind... All right, I got it. Why does it want me to do the

282
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:39,719
crazy drift here? Pop all the balloons within the... okay, pop the balloons.

283
00:56:41,079 --> 00:56:50,179
You have to get a crazy dash right after a crazy drift. Crazy dash is... let off the...

284
00:56:50,179 --> 00:57:07,860
let off the accelerator, shift into D, press the accelerator. Let's see. Oh boy, that's hard to

285
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:13,320
do that. What if I'm already... okay, hold on. What if I'm already in reverse... if I'm

286
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:25,639
already in drive? That's so confusing. So if you're in reverse, you have to be in reverse.

287
00:57:25,719 --> 00:57:37,829
Totally learn how to do that. You're doing a drift, shift into drive, and then do...

288
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:56,570
accelerate. But what if I'm not in? That makes no sense to me. So hold on. A crazy dash

289
00:57:56,570 --> 00:58:00,489
is you let off the accelerator and then you have to shift into drive and then press the

290
00:58:00,489 --> 00:58:06,099
accelerator, right? To do a... to do a... no, god damn it. I want to look at the...

291
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:23,829
You have to shift into reversed and then shift into drive. So but you then... but you

292
00:58:23,829 --> 00:58:53,179
have to shift. So is it just like a practice arena? So hold on. Just set up a macro. That seems

293
00:58:53,739 --> 00:59:07,610
really hard to do, reliably. Shift back into drive after shifting from reverse to drive.

294
00:59:08,489 --> 00:59:28,389
Let off the accelerator. Well, shift into reverse, drive, shift into drive. Okay, well,

295
00:59:28,389 --> 00:59:41,539
I'm just gonna play. I'm just gonna try to do it. What is 2-2? Time limit. You gotta go

296
00:59:41,539 --> 00:59:48,710
into reverse, turn, and then drive. Well, let me just try to do this with my new techniques

297
00:59:48,710 --> 01:00:09,880
that I've learned. All right, that's good. Even that alone is gonna help. No, it's not.

298
01:00:17,179 --> 01:00:23,190
Oh my god! That's not helping at all, actually. The drift just makes you go crazy.

299
01:00:31,820 --> 01:01:15,059
Jesus! I'm just like killing people. Oh, A, B. Oh, that's annoying. Okay, I'm gonna

300
01:01:15,059 --> 01:01:29,530
try for drift. The drift uphill. What a great idea. I mean, that was kind of cool. That should be.

301
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:47,579
Nope, but I'm in reverse. What the fuck is happening? I've done like exponentially worse

302
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:53,289
since involving the like advanced techniques. So now I'm in reverse. I don't like that

303
01:01:53,289 --> 01:02:06,920
mechanic. The handbrake should not be reversed. It's completed! Only two dollars

304
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:23,300
can be driving into a train in the last second pulling away. Holy fuck, that was 20 dollars.

305
01:02:24,099 --> 01:02:25,800
Hold on, I'm gonna try it again.

306
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:46,699
Somebody mentioned, it probably would be insane to see somebody do like a super expert,

307
01:02:46,699 --> 01:02:59,849
like 3,000 hours in crazy taxi gameplay. That would be pretty insane. I'm only gonna

308
01:02:59,849 --> 01:03:06,739
use the drift. I'm only gonna use those techniques when I need them. For instance,

309
01:03:06,739 --> 01:03:12,760
right there and then be in reverse. I thought those were just tables, like

310
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:32,019
technique tables on the street. I can't go in that way. This is all wrong.

311
01:03:38,820 --> 01:04:20,820
Really? Let's go. There it is! Come on, get out! 17 bucks! Lot of money, let's go!

312
01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:45,769
That would have been clean if that asshole wasn't in the way. How many cars to do this?

313
01:04:49,380 --> 01:05:25,719
Undrift, too many cars. No! Goddamn drift acceleration! Sorry. God, please.

314
01:05:32,440 --> 01:06:10,300
Turn, turn around! Go for that jump. Get out of my way. It's right here. I need somebody right

315
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:22,789
now. Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, anybody, anyone, anyone, you! Get in! Why?

316
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:27,590
That's so hard to fucking do that reliably. Like, actually win a game without sitting there.

317
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,809
Jesus Christ. We're gonna see again.

318
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:12,619
I'll give it a few more attempts before we move on, because we got a lot of other shit to do.

319
01:07:13,579 --> 01:07:26,090
He got worse after he trained. Yeah, because the techniques you have to do are actually

320
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:37,260
fairly difficult to pull off in a game scenario. Like, those drifts, you get tips,

321
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:43,880
but you don't complete. You're like, holy fuck, that was a lot of money, but like,

322
01:07:43,880 --> 01:08:19,850
I screwed myself up. I lost like four seconds. Where'd it go? What? Okay, what the fuck is this?

323
01:08:25,829 --> 01:08:37,859
No! Hello? What the fuck is happening? What? Oh my fucking, give me a break. Really?

324
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:54,949
That was annoying. Let's drop Xbox. He just decided to turn down, he just turned the

325
01:08:54,949 --> 01:09:05,180
control off. That was great. That was really fun. Imagine if I was like at Gwyn in Dark Souls

326
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:37,100
when that happens. Get out! Get it! I'm gonna go, it's the same person that, where the fuck do

327
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:57,779
you want me to take you? Every way is the wrong way. Well, this is the right way. Get out!

328
01:09:57,779 --> 01:10:29,829
I'm going, not bad. All right, I gotta just focus on the next couple and just actually

329
01:10:29,829 --> 01:10:50,520
deliver people. Any time. I'm not doing, I'm not delivering nearly as many people

330
01:10:50,520 --> 01:11:07,460
as I was before. That's like half. I don't get it. Let's see if I can get this delivered.

331
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:30,390
I don't know, unless it's somebody right here. A class D license!

332
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:52,460
This isn't the right soundtrack. All right, last try. Last try to get above C.

333
01:11:53,420 --> 01:12:17,000
Last attempt. It's clean. Only drip when I need to. I mean, that, not right there. It's okay.

334
01:12:17,880 --> 01:13:06,489
Get out of my car! Get out of my fucking car! Lots of fucking time now. Hit the jump, come on.

335
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:18,630
Christ. Where the fuck am I going? What the hell? This is far away.

336
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:56,149
You use car shop. What the fuck? What the hell? No! The fucking arrow just like freaked out.

337
01:13:56,869 --> 01:14:05,060
Oh god damn it. What? I'm not going to make this jump. What the hell was that?

338
01:14:05,939 --> 01:14:35,210
I still, it's okay. Just get, I can build time. Somebody right there. Get out. Whatever,

339
01:14:35,210 --> 01:14:53,909
doesn't matter. Trying to pull off something there, but I couldn't. All right, just drive. Get

340
01:14:53,909 --> 01:15:27,000
there. I fucking lowered that arrow. Just point over here. I gotta get it. This game is so hard.

341
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:34,810
It's so addicting, but it's so difficult. I can't imagine what a perfect gameplay of

342
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:40,949
this looks like. Holy shit, it's probably amazing. All right, one more time. Last try

343
01:15:40,949 --> 01:16:02,939
to do this. I'm gonna go with you first. You've ruined it. Retry. Last try. Last retry.

344
01:16:02,939 --> 01:16:06,539
One more retry after this if I fuck it up. One more retry after that. One more retry after this.

345
01:16:06,539 --> 01:16:20,060
One final retry after the last retry. You understand? Go. All right, no fun, no funny

346
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:27,460
business. Just try to get above a C. I can do it. That's even a little bit funny business

347
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:47,779
there. It's good. It's okay. Fuck! Don't freak out. Easy. Okay, that's one retry.

348
01:16:48,659 --> 01:17:13,159
That's a, that was a good start. Don't blow it. Good start. Very good.

349
01:17:14,869 --> 01:17:28,220
Exceptional quality. My controller just ripped. I just got possessed. I didn't do that.

350
01:17:28,779 --> 01:17:45,979
I'm gonna use car shop. I know what that is. It's literally right here.

351
01:17:49,939 --> 01:18:08,300
Easiest one I've done all day. Get it. Big Hills Park. All right, get some money. Stupid

352
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:17,659
fucking Winnipeg. I'll get out of my way. No drifting. Just good driving. That still

353
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:44,760
qualifies as good driving. Still qualifies as good driving. Get in the car, dummy. Nice.

354
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:52,550
Just thread the needle. Just go, just go, go, go. Keep going down this way. You can

355
01:18:52,550 --> 01:19:37,899
wrap around. No, he's unraveling. He's unraveling. Oh no. What the fuck is this

356
01:19:37,899 --> 01:19:49,270
traffic? It's over. It's over. I don't want to see the fucking end. I don't care.

357
01:19:53,350 --> 01:20:06,920
God damn. This is so hard. How did I get like 2,800 alls that last time?

358
01:20:12,170 --> 01:20:48,710
No, it's all right. Get out. That was bullshit. Here we go. Ready? One, two, three.

359
01:20:49,590 --> 01:22:22,170
I'm gonna be quiet. Oh my god. I, god. Why? Why? This is how I got all you quarters

360
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:47,529
for the arcade. You know they stole all your quarters. This is like 75 cents

361
01:22:47,529 --> 01:23:05,449
for one play. Free coins. Really? I take that fucking cash money thing. I need another person.

362
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:30,810
I'm not gonna make it. No way. No. I'm forever stuck at like $2,000. Forever. What just

363
01:23:30,810 --> 01:23:38,869
happened to the assets? They all just... What's going on? I got it still. Get out of my fucking

364
01:23:38,869 --> 01:24:11,449
car. Where is this? Beach? Fuck off. What is happening? I'm not gonna even get it.

365
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:21,859
Get out of my fucking car now. Who's right here? Anybody? Forever stuck at like $2,500.

366
01:24:32,420 --> 01:24:38,500
Come on. I have to get it. I have to get it. I can't move on yet. I have to get B.

367
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:51,539
Six customers though. It's getting better. I got it. I have to do this.

368
01:24:56,729 --> 01:24:58,649
Let's see. Gotta get that right off the bat.

369
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:23,340
Okay this is the equivalent of me at the arcade. I'm ripping the cord out of the

370
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:28,140
back where it's plugged into the wall at Dave and Buster's and I'm plugging it back in.

371
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:58,279
I'm gonna get thrown out. Get it. Come on. This is the one. I almost just ripped the cord

372
01:25:58,279 --> 01:27:11,800
out of the wall. It was close. Got it. This is the one. Get up. Pizza parlor. Let's go.

373
01:27:12,439 --> 01:27:40,329
Didn't even see that guy. That guy didn't even load. I'm in the worst possible position. No.

374
01:27:49,020 --> 01:28:13,060
Use car shop. I know what that is. I gotta get green here. I thought it was a barrel returning.

375
01:28:13,939 --> 01:28:53,420
Fuck you. You fucking bust. Oh my god. Restart it.

376
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:19,130
The only way you can get like an A or S rank in this game is if you landed here in a

377
01:29:19,130 --> 01:29:25,619
spaceship like 400 years ago and you've been like just you're just wearing like people's skin

378
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:32,470
and you're just pretending to be a person you've been like jumping around from body to body

379
01:29:32,470 --> 01:29:39,289
you're like oh that was fun being Julius Caesar for a week that was fun let me try let me

380
01:29:39,289 --> 01:29:46,090
try like crazy taxi fucking world record holder that sounds fun and you got your inhuman

381
01:29:46,090 --> 01:30:03,699
reaction getting stabbed like the level of skill required you definitely are just you land

382
01:30:03,699 --> 01:30:09,399
you have this manager you oh you got like the powers you got possessed you got like the gamer

428
01:47:29,539 --> 01:47:41,699
all right this is the last try before i uninstall the game forever after that one

429
01:47:41,699 --> 01:47:58,649
i'm so close but so far when you come to a complete stop in this game honest to god it

430
01:47:58,649 --> 01:48:05,930
is so hard to start driving again even when you do this bullshit half the time don't

435
01:49:49,609 --> 01:49:53,930
i forgot this is the one that makes you this is the worst one to pick up because

436
01:49:53,930 --> 01:50:13,369
the arrow just points around the circle the whole time there's nobody even here

437
01:50:14,170 --> 01:50:27,939

489
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:25,130
ago all right i think i think something's wrong with the computer now because there's

490
02:07:25,130 --> 02:07:33,560
a little box that's floating in the middle of my screen i'm not sure i'm going to be able to load

491
02:07:34,199 --> 02:07:49,590
a game let me see hold on no i guess i guess we're okay that's crazy taxi it's oh awesome

492
02:07:49,590 --> 02:07:59,770
the game's a blast and now we're going to move on to space channel five somehow this is space

493
02:07:59,770 --> 02:08:14,020
channel five uh part two let me just uh make sure it is correctly now that's 12 it's 1280

494
02:08:14,020 --> 02:08:23,989
by 720 no no no no it's gonna be better than that okay looks good audio we're gonna have to

495
02:08:23,989 --> 02:08:30,840
have the sound i mean this is a music game so the music is gonna be up right let me just

496
02:08:30,840 --> 02:08:39,130
change this part two is very hard that's all right just see how long it takes me to fucking

497
02:08:39,130 --> 02:08:44,180
scream at this one i don't want to be that guy though am i like turning into that guy

498
02:08:44,180 --> 02:08:50,310
that's like the older like 30 plus youtuber streamer that just is like this guy i'm not

499
02:08:50,310 --> 02:08:57,460
good at this i don't like this i don't like this game i'm not sure is that happening in

500
02:08:57,460 --> 02:09:10,699
real time here i'm gonna work on that i don't want to be i don't want to turn into like the

501
02:09:10,699 --> 02:09:17,560
old boomer mutant guy i don't want to do that all right let me this is not capturing for

502
02:09:17,560 --> 02:09:28,819
some reason this is very soft settings let me just stereo vibration off lyrics on screen mode

503
02:09:28,819 --> 02:09:40,859
widescreen why is this so low this is very quiet i can't change the settings in here hold on

504
02:09:43,140 --> 02:09:54,710
really i can't put the settings in hold on options play game there's no that's annoying

505
02:09:55,270 --> 02:10:02,439
well at least let you see what i'm looking at uh i'm gonna have to reload the game and

506
02:10:02,439 --> 02:10:11,939
put the audio up because there doesn't seem to be an option here there's like settings

507
02:10:11,939 --> 02:10:17,380
but that doesn't sound stereo there's no volume slider the volume slider already hold on

508
02:10:17,380 --> 02:10:32,260
i'm gonna do this hopefully this works otherwise i'm not sure what the fix it for that is so this

509
02:10:32,260 --> 02:10:41,189
is a hard game isn't this like parapa the rapa audio sound effects that's not that low

510
02:10:43,850 --> 02:11:03,510
that's normal see if that does anything presented by sega uh okay come on now it's very loud

511
02:11:05,159 --> 02:11:06,840
now it's extraordinarily loud

512
02:11:10,119 --> 02:11:17,960
all right well uh i'm gonna hold on i'm almost at the sweet spot another like 10%

513
02:11:18,779 --> 02:11:36,170
down that's probably good that's probably the sweet spot yeah if you're just joining us and

514
02:11:36,170 --> 02:11:39,130
you don't know uh i want to make sure i reiterate it because we had a little

515
02:11:39,770 --> 02:11:44,810
10 20 minutes in the beginning of the stream shirts are now available there is a new shirt

516
02:11:45,609 --> 02:11:48,329
and why don't we just put it on the screen because people probably like wait what the heck's

02:18:20,340 --> 02:18:47,319
would some of the assets just not work uh should i like verify the game cache okay i'm

550
02:18:47,319 --> 02:19:01,110
gonna verify integrity of game files because you're missing part one of the game the menu

551
02:19:01,110 --> 02:19:04,389
is supposed to look like that all files successfully validated i think i'm just

552
02:19:04,389 --> 02:19:13,139
it's just not rendering somehow turning off vsync works i just turned it off maybe i'll

553
02:19:13,139 --> 02:19:17,780
check i'll choose like a different adapter maybe i'll choose like nvidia gtx number one or two

554
02:19:17,780 --> 02:19:23,430
let's just try one because i don't know why there's three adapters here when i have one

555
02:19:24,469 --> 02:19:29,930
let me try like 12 1920 by 1080 at 60 hertz maybe that are trying to do anything else

556
02:19:29,930 --> 02:19:40,729
let's just try 60 hertz all right v sync is off everything's off see if it does it

557
02:19:40,729 --> 02:19:48,780
on this adapter is this this yeah this is the steam version of this game hey one of the shirts

558
02:19:48,780 --> 02:19:56,860
gonna be available they are available right now um i okay so i figured out this is putting it on

559
02:19:56,860 --> 02:20:03,049
a different monitor but that's not gonna help that's just what that means zero one and two

560
02:20:03,049 --> 02:20:15,049
okay i don't think this is gonna do anything oh it's still fucked up well uh that was space

561
02:20:15,049 --> 02:20:21,899
channel five part two for some reason that i don't unless there's uh turn down the

562
02:20:21,899 --> 02:20:36,940
resolution i will try doing that i'm gonna turn off uh fxaa the resolution is now at

563
02:20:36,940 --> 02:20:49,430
let's just do i don't know 14 1600 by 900 see what that does the menu is supposed to

564
02:20:49,430 --> 02:20:56,170
look like that oh well why does everybody tell me it wasn't the menu is supposed to

565
02:20:56,170 --> 02:21:09,989
look like that uh a bunch of people told me that was let's try it again i dropped

566
02:21:09,989 --> 02:21:17,909
the resolution turned off v sync i will fix this if it works okay i can just fix it right now who

567
02:21:17,909 --> 02:21:45,350
cares uh hello did it work come on uh don't think of it hell so you're telling me that

568
02:21:45,350 --> 02:21:49,270
the reason why i didn't buy space channel five on the dreamcast is because i know that they

569
02:21:49,270 --> 02:22:03,750
ported it to pc and the port doesn't work well uh we'll maybe try that again later

570
02:22:04,549 --> 02:22:07,430
but for the purposes i'm gonna move on to a different one maybe i'll

571
02:22:08,229 --> 02:22:09,270
we'll come back and try it again

572
02:22:11,590 --> 02:22:20,440
unfortunately that's just kind of how it is turn v-sync is off everything is off all right

573
02:22:20,440 --> 02:22:25,750
let's do uh move on from that one that's too bad i wanted to play that for a while too

574
02:22:26,899 --> 02:22:35,209
so we have uh we have knights what else is in the collection knights is in here sonic

575
02:22:35,290 --> 02:22:44,180
adventure like dx whatever the hell that is sonic adventure dx this one i was told

576
02:22:44,180 --> 02:22:50,090
to play the dreamcast one jet set radio sega bass fishing let's do sega bass fishing

577
02:22:50,809 --> 02:23:02,170
we got all night guys don't worry hopefully that doesn't happen to more than one of these that

578
02:23:02,170 --> 02:23:17,909
would be kind of sad because you know that would be really unfortunate if percentage wise

579
02:23:17,909 --> 02:23:22,389
700 000 games had more working titles than the dreamcast collection on windows

580
02:23:22,389 --> 02:23:37,100
that would be very very sad all right oh we're good with audio let's go i'm trying what do

581
02:23:37,100 --> 02:23:54,659
you i what do you think i'm doing okay here's this see if it works do we have we have assets

582
02:23:54,659 --> 02:24:07,420

596
02:26:32,700 --> 02:26:50,979
is it left stick spin around left trigger i don't understand i think we need to go to the

controls menu hook rod control move cast indicator move selection reeling fast lure

598
02:27:04,739 --> 02:27:14,229

740
03:00:20,739 --> 03:00:25,340
this one being fairly decent you know if it was good enough for me to put it on a playlist

741
03:00:25,340 --> 03:00:39,399

746
03:02:04,299 --> 03:02:11,239
the only thing i know about naruto is just like bark simpson naruto was voiced by

747
03:02:11,239 --> 03:02:29,879
like a 75 year old man jump as soon as you land on the panel or else you'll fall

748
03:02:29,879 --> 03:02:43,479

756
03:04:04,569 --> 03:04:09,770
test flights alphonse and edward this thing's got unlimited power you know so i figured why

758
03:04:17,850 --> 03:04:24,569

764
03:05:56,579 --> 03:06:07,930
camera i mean i can't really think of a worse camera than this game tails workshop should be

765
03:06:08,010 --> 03:06:09,129
around here somewhere

766
03:06:21,079 --> 03:06:26,219
if it isn't sonic he's not wearing clothes i just realized that it's a giant talking egg

767
03:06:27,260 --> 03:06:32,780
i thought sonic got shorts on the pants the greatest scientific genius in the world

768
03:06:34,379 --> 03:06:39,500
whatever you say egg man actually running around naked 150 miles per hour

769
03:06:39,819 --> 03:06:45,260
now i'm gonna put them to work you're always up to no good now what do you want

770
03:06:45,819 --> 03:06:54,139
i want all of the chaos emeralds better not interfere or else or else what you big loser

771
03:06:55,579 --> 03:07:12,729
or else i'll take them from you by force the hard way three times what about eggman

772
03:07:12,729 --> 03:07:18,649
that's really weird he always uses this same ship every game he makes another one

773
03:07:18,729 --> 03:07:27,190
oh eggman can you just make something else that's not the little circle spaceship thing

774
03:07:27,190 --> 03:07:50,729
that i hit three times it worked i think i have to jump on the i'm assuming homing dash

775
03:07:50,729 --> 03:08:03,799
on the missiles would be what i would do whole systems full power run real fast

776
03:08:04,280 --> 03:08:14,629
yeah land on top whole systems full power

777
03:08:16,469 --> 03:08:18,469
he's not gonna get away with this

778
03:08:32,090 --> 03:08:39,819
this is kind of making me sick i'm sorry it is whole systems full power no you hit me three

779
03:08:39,819 --> 03:08:48,379
times no i actually hit the sector motor takes to kill me hey i'll play with you some other

780
03:08:49,340 --> 03:08:59,719
who's the engineer making these like you gotta have a conversation with whoever is on your dev

781
03:08:59,719 --> 03:09:06,489
team and can we have a device that's not going to take three bumps and explode it has to be

782
03:09:06,489 --> 03:09:09,610
away i don't know what you're using for materials but it has to be something well that

783
03:09:09,610 --> 03:09:29,930
wasn't so hard nice job tail you brought that out there chaos why are you still holding

784

787
03:09:59,940 --> 03:10:04,819

03:10:23,059 --> 03:10:30,629
of dragon ball because they love dragon ball so much that's what he said right sonic you

792
03:10:30,629 --> 03:10:40,309
can't let him get away with this can we no way tails so it's up to us to get the emeralds

793
03:10:40,309 --> 03:10:46,569
before eggman does huh that's why he goes super saiyan he turns into like yellow hair

809
03:16:16,739 --> 03:16:22,299
should be able to get out of the tornado time limit or something this looks like it has a

810
03:16:22,299 --> 03:16:28,059
time on panel number one it will take you to panels two and three jump as soon as you

811
03:16:28,059 --> 03:16:48,020
land on a panel or else you'll fall two more good wild all right where do i go from here

yeah not bad the do the train headed for station square will be departing soon

820
03:18:58,629 --> 03:19:05,190

821
03:19:05,190 --> 03:19:09,750
this long ago even though maybe it's a little i don't know i can't i don't really have an

822
03:19:09,750 --> 03:19:37,899
opinion i need to go to station square you may find something oh casino time i mean don't

823
03:19:37,899 --> 03:19:41,420
worry right now i'm saying yeah this is kind of cool it's fun it's old but it's interesting

824
03:19:41,420 --> 03:19:44,459
and like don't worry give it like another 30 minutes i'm gonna tell you how this is the worst

825
03:19:44,459 --> 03:19:49,579
game i've ever played there's a place somewhere in the city where you can go down into the sewer

826
03:19:50,379 --> 03:20:00,219
just give it like 30 you'll hear me all right this twinkle park no casino is over here

829
03:20:47,430 --> 03:21:14,059
door okay uh all right sewer if i was a sewer where would i be probably not this way somewhere

830
03:21:14,059 --> 03:21:53,899
on the street out here like a sewer to me super suit what is it now you've got light speed

831
03:21:54,059 --> 03:21:59,500
light speed press and hold the action button to store up power once you have enough power

832
03:21:59,500 --> 03:22:03,979
release the button and you can do the light speed dash oh cool the light speed dash lets

833
03:22:03,979 --> 03:22:08,700
you race toward rings at light speed as long as there's a trail of rings you can go just

834
03:22:08,700 --> 03:22:20,729
about anyway you know that's all the thing i was just trying to do use the light dash

835
03:22:20,729 --> 03:22:25,850
to run along the paths of rings hold the action button and let go when you have enough

836
03:22:25,850 --> 03:22:34,969
power okay do i have enough power you have to actually hold it for a while

837
03:22:35,690 --> 03:22:58,069
and now i can go back and go in that room egg what do i mean egg what i can pick i can pick

838

848
03:25:46,379 --> 03:26:03,079
i thought that they said i can't go in the front door all right this camera is seriously

849
03:26:03,079 --> 03:26:19,770
starting to piss me off i can't even turn the fucking thing around all right let's go

850
03:26:30,389 --> 03:26:39,750
i like this level slot pinball for us ahead these l1 and r1 remove the flipper and match

851
03:26:39,750 --> 03:26:46,760
three pictures in a row and shoot the ball towards the arrow if it's dumped in the garage

852
03:26:46,760 --> 03:27:01,620
you don't have a hundred rings shit i don't have any money pause it your rings i can't activate

853
03:27:01,620 --> 03:27:13,020
any of these i guess okay all right well hold on if it's that well i can't blame sega for

854
03:27:13,020 --> 03:27:19,979
having a 5000 decibel game that they didn't fix and it doesn't matter i just turned down

855
03:27:19,979 --> 03:27:29,829
my audio on windows like my desktop windows audio to 15 listen to this listen to this shit

856
03:27:30,889 --> 03:27:44,489
let's open up sonic all right i have to drop it in three different places now

857
03:27:44,489 --> 03:28:02,059
because now i can't hear anything how's that turn the sound down in the game options well

858
03:28:02,059 --> 03:28:05,659
the funny thing about that is i have to exit the game and restart the game to do that i did

859
03:28:05,659 --> 03:28:10,219
three times pretty much already so i really don't want to exit the game to turn the sound

860
03:28:10,299 --> 03:28:26,780
down all right so what do i go from here cards is card pinball so i can't do any of this

861
03:28:27,739 --> 03:28:33,850
you missed three times however you have less than 100 rings you get dumped in the garage

862
03:28:37,750 --> 03:28:42,489
so i don't know i'm just gonna get dumped in the garage this is like a stack of money

863
03:28:42,489 --> 03:29:02,920
somewhere shower room well i'm robbing the casino apparently i'm just punching machines

864
03:29:03,639 --> 03:29:48,840
that's not okay wash yourself up anymore there's not you know it's not the video game that's going

865
03:29:48,840 --> 03:29:55,899
to make me turn this game off it's a camera i don't mind the game i just would love to see

866
03:29:55,899 --> 03:30:24,870
it at the angle that i want to see that okay so what are you telling me i can just do this

867
03:30:25,590 --> 03:30:33,989
you just go in i thought if you have less than 100 rings you just get dumped in the

868
03:30:33,989 --> 03:30:49,399
garage don't have to use money to make money i'll just get free money what kind of

869

952
03:53:32,569 --> 03:53:58,420
how it works what happened to you all right i'm out there are other gardens all right so uh the

955
03:54:35,299 --> 03:54:39,379
this is the crystal ring what do i get to do this reduces the time needed to store power

956
03:54:39,379 --> 03:54:47,340
for the light speed dash nice so let's see how let's see what the timer is i can move

957
03:54:47,340 --> 03:54:56,729
around with this on what does that activate is that just the door there's no other cool thing

958
03:54:56,729 --> 03:55:07,420
to do there is he gonna play through the whole game uh no i don't think so we have a couple

959
03:55:07,420 --> 03:55:12,940
other things to get through that i'd want to play this game's fun though it's not it's not a bad

960
03:55:12,940 --> 03:55:18,729
game all right uh i have to go back to the casino alley to get the key even though because

961
03:55:18,729 --> 03:55:33,979
i went into the dumb garden play the whole thing do you guys really want that don't play

962
03:55:33,979 --> 03:55:47,209
the stupid idiot blue rat game i'm not gonna play the whole thing don't worry i just need

963
03:55:47,209 --> 03:55:53,879
to know where the elevator is no not the elevator the train do i have to go out here

964
03:55:55,590 --> 03:56:20,059
up where is the train it's up the stairs no not that way not that way but not that towards the

965
03:56:20,059 --> 03:56:36,709
casino in the chow garden there is the train headed for the mystic ruins will be departing

966
03:56:36,709 --> 03:56:56,790
soon so i have to bring this to the ice center wherever the hell that is in there

967
03:56:57,350 --> 03:57:25,909
i'm assuming it's the giant wall that just broke open uh is it not okay didn't you see a

968
03:57:25,989 --> 03:57:46,569
stone with an ice pattern on it i don't think i did the one guy who said it's not the right way

969
03:57:46,569 --> 03:57:53,979
well i this is the thing i saw when i looked over that's what i saw i saw more than one guy

970
03:57:53,979 --> 03:57:57,819
i saw like wrong way idiot like is he this bad and i'm like that has to be right because

971
03:57:57,819 --> 03:58:28,139
he said that ice when does sonic use a ladder ice cap get the chaos emerald you got it

972
03:58:28,700 --> 03:58:29,340
what is it

973
03:58:29,340 --> 03:58:34,059
tutorial if you're frozen jump a couple of times and you should be able to crack through

974
03:58:34,780 --> 03:58:50,440
okay what's that i don't know so i gotta continuously jump to the icicle and jump

975
03:58:50,440 --> 03:58:55,159
you should be able to jump backwards but don't hold on too long you'll slip right off

976
03:58:56,600 --> 03:59:16,790
uh that's very awkward that's awkward shoot the gun uh did i is that correct

977
03:59:19,430 --> 03:59:23,989
i guess no i have the sonic run super thing don't i what the hell am i doing

1018
04:11:03,590 --> 04:11:10,500
objectively this is awful but like the video game is not it's not terrible it's not that bad

1019
04:11:10,500 --> 04:11:28,229
it's pretty it's pretty decent the game is i think fun sonic's cool so there's nothing

1020
04:11:28,229 --> 04:11:32,870
wrong with sonic it's just those cutscenes are just there's not there's nothing to them

1021
04:11:32,870 --> 04:11:51,129
all right let's go see big the cat hey look for all the sonic is still around sonic is still

1098
04:34:12,700 --> 04:34:25,880
here we go somewhere in asia there's a city that cannot be found on any map called tokyo

1099
04:34:25,880 --> 04:34:30,680
to but everyone just calls it tokyo the two hottest things in the streets of tokyo to

1100
04:34:30,680 --> 04:34:35,319
are the punks wearing magnetically driven inline skates powered by newly developed

1101
04:34:35,319 --> 04:34:41,959
metrium batteries and jet set radio a pirate radio station manned by the dj professor k that

1102
04:34:41,959 --> 04:34:46,279
plays nothing but non-stop hardcore music those street punks have been named rudies

1103
04:34:46,279 --> 04:34:51,240
hardcore public music they roam the streets and cover the city with their personal graffiti

1104
04:34:51,240 --> 04:34:56,040
claiming that it is their way of expressing themselves to the world however ever since the

1105
04:34:56,040 --> 04:35:00,439
metropolitan government and the financial conglomerate the ruca group combined their

1106
04:35:00,439 --> 04:35:05,560
efforts to co-found the 21st century project the streets of tokyo to have never been the

1107
04:35:05,560 --> 04:35:11,319
same again police crackdowns on the rudies have become more severe and captain onishima

1108
04:35:11,319 --> 04:35:16,119
is more anxious than ever to put them behind bars the streets of tokyo to are ready to

1109
04:35:16,119 --> 04:35:23,700
explode and that's where you come in hold it you can't go tripping through the streets

1110
04:35:23,700 --> 04:35:54,520
so you learn some of the basic no i skipped this i know i can't go through the road runner

05:11:02,580 --> 05:11:31,659
this man this game is very good but it's very very precise and very hard and there's a lot of

1245
05:11:31,659 --> 05:11:38,700
you know if you like characters admission fucking wood and you'll love it but no this game is

1246
05:11:38,700 --> 05:11:45,189
actually very cool it paved the way for a defining genre of bending genre creating

1247
05:11:46,310 --> 05:12:06,259
experience finish it how much more is this that's gonna be at least a million

1248

1250
05:13:32,819 --> 05:14:02,549
i got it you don't need to get the greens yeah but they're extra points

1251
05:14:13,720 --> 05:14:17,159
that's the end of the stream boys no it's not the end of the screen

1252
05:14:17,880 --> 05:14:20,700
we're not done we might be done with this game

1254
05:14:53,110 --> 05:14:56,549

1257
05:15:57,450 --> 05:16:14,729
set radio uh it's a good game it's just um it's just very very difficult very precise

1258
05:16:15,689 --> 05:16:19,369
and you can't play it like tony hawke you have to pretend you're made out of wood and that your

1259
05:16:19,369 --> 05:16:35,860
shoes have glue on them that's how you play it's a good game it's in it's very interesting

1260
05:16:39,189 --> 05:16:49,450
go back to floygan he's too salty i'm not salty i'm not it's just i think that has a

1261
05:16:49,450 --> 05:16:56,869
lot of learning curve and i don't want to sit there and play that all day it's i'm not mad

1262
05:16:56,869 --> 05:17:01,189
at that game it's just i i'm it's it's a it's i i've told you a thousand times it's a very

1263
05:17:01,189 --> 05:17:17,259
good game how do i get space channel five to work how did you survive crazy taxi learning

1264
05:17:17,259 --> 05:17:30,060
curve but not jet set radio because fast car go fast and there's money involved all right

1265

1268
05:17:47,720 --> 05:21:12,790
taxi again maybe because i'm addicted i will be right back see if we can get it to work i don't

1269
05:21:12,790 --> 05:21:18,599

1270
05:21:18,599 --> 05:21:22,680
is not working i went into steam discussions and it's like oh yeah i don't know how to get

1271
05:21:22,680 --> 05:21:27,560
it to work i'm missing character models i've restarted the game and it's fine like uh

Oh

1426
06:26:46,919 --> 06:26:48,919
Oh

1427
06:27:13,439 --> 06:27:15,439
No

1428
06:27:17,099 --> 06:27:20,360
Oh

1429
06:28:17,599 --> 06:28:19,599
Your brain just mixes them together

1430
06:29:19,720 --> 06:29:21,720
Scratching my head

1431
06:29:21,840 --> 06:29:23,840
You get out of here

1432
06:29:24,680 --> 06:29:49,830
It's another one in the bag I think I got this

1433
06:29:54,729 --> 06:29:59,779
Shut up

1434
06:29:59,779 --> 06:30:51,069
Rock, I don't know why I looked at chat to see what people were saying. You can't do that. Hey, what am I gonna?

1435
06:30:52,409 --> 06:30:55,750
What do you guys have to say? Oh cool

1436
06:31:05,779 --> 06:31:56,180
Come on come on quick just do it again

1437
06:31:56,979 --> 06:32:13,709
Fuck oh my goodness gracious. That was just too many things. Oh

1438
06:32:23,020 --> 06:32:42,919
He needs a parry I

1439
06:32:42,959 --> 06:32:45,779
Guess maybe playing through them a couple of times

1440
06:32:46,220 --> 06:32:51,380
playing through more than twice you can start to memorize things, but

1441
06:32:52,139 --> 06:33:00,389
No secrets

1442
06:33:01,229 --> 06:33:08,750
What happens face Michael, yeah, that's a really good question

1443
06:33:15,779 --> 06:33:18,419
The achievement by the way for that was who

1444
06:33:19,020 --> 06:33:25,659
H o o o o for those of you gnomes in the chat that find that to be very interesting

1445
06:33:45,990 --> 06:33:54,029
I haven't hit the wall yet. So we're gonna keep going Michael's fine. He's right here

1446
06:33:55,069 --> 06:33:59,669
It's a weird level. Good evening, everybody. We heard it through pines broadcast

1447
06:34:02,880 --> 06:34:16,369
We see something ahead, what's that the reading on Persian the president points us in favor where level

1448
06:34:16,970 --> 06:34:22,060
The film grain is actually hurting my face. It's alright

1449
06:34:22,740 --> 06:34:26,319
We got them

1450
06:34:27,319 --> 06:34:32,000
The whole cruise here the entire Final Fantasy party memorize the poses

1451
06:34:43,450 --> 06:34:53,270
My fucking hands my fucking hands now do it again, I slipped off I slipped off the fucking controller

1452
06:35:06,250 --> 06:35:11,689
I've pressed it and it went and my grease covered finger flipped over

1453
06:35:14,729 --> 06:35:18,650
What's that the reading on Persian the president points us in this direction

1454
06:35:19,529 --> 06:35:24,220
That's not even a real problem. It's time to take a break what I

1455
06:35:25,180 --> 06:35:27,490
Just slipped off my controller

1456
06:35:58,540 --> 06:36:01,549
Yeah, that is Michael Jackson

1457
06:36:15,040 --> 06:36:25,389
Oh

1458
06:37:18,020 --> 06:37:29,549
It's the pattern that they come out in oh my fucking Jesus

1459
06:37:29,709 --> 06:37:31,709
Okay

1460
06:37:44,979 --> 06:37:51,139
The pauses take you out of the beat and make you have to like memorize what you just saw and heard

1461
06:37:51,340 --> 06:37:56,360
Five seconds later and it's hard for your brain to do that. That's why it's intentional

1462
06:37:56,880 --> 06:38:02,130
For them to put it like that

1463
06:38:19,470 --> 06:38:21,470
Michael

1464
06:38:27,299 --> 06:38:43,750
Oh

1465
06:38:43,750 --> 06:38:48,349
My god, I know I might need a break that person was right that person was right. I need a break

1466
06:38:48,349 --> 06:38:56,590
I have no idea what this is

1467
06:39:03,040 --> 06:39:05,840
What

1468
06:39:07,560 --> 06:39:18,360
That's I gotta do the whole thing good evening everybody we heard it through pines broadcast

1469
06:39:22,580 --> 06:39:33,240
Can't skip this either we see something ahead. What's that the reading on Persian the president?

1470
06:39:33,520 --> 06:39:35,439
points us in this direction

1471
06:39:35,439 --> 06:39:42,180
Come back another time to it. I probably you know, I probably will this game's a lot of fun. Let me try it one more time

1472
06:39:47,840 --> 06:39:50,779
This is very very fun game

1473
06:40:12,450 --> 06:40:18,340
Play it while you're drunk. That would be the worst mistake ever

1474
06:40:19,979 --> 06:40:47,270
No stars lost there. No stars have been lost. This is the hard one

1475
06:40:48,590 --> 06:41:13,740
Yeah, I missed it already fuck it up already. Oh, this is hell trying to memorize it in the rail. God damn it

1476
06:41:13,740 --> 06:41:15,619
I couldn't get it. I

1477
06:41:15,619 --> 06:41:18,639
Thought I was I was paying attention to the last three and then I blew it

1478
06:41:24,779 --> 06:41:38,380
Got that one I fucking missed it

1479
06:41:42,459 --> 06:41:44,819
Just give me the star I

1480
06:41:46,259 --> 06:41:50,380
Blinked and I missed the first one. I actually blinked and I fucking didn't catch the first one

1481
06:42:18,580 --> 06:42:22,180
All right, let me pay attention this one it's just all my eyes on screen we go

1482
06:42:40,180 --> 06:42:51,700
My fucking lord

1483
06:42:52,060 --> 06:42:57,590
No

1484
06:42:57,590 --> 06:43:01,599
My god, it's really not that big of a deal

1485
06:43:01,599 --> 06:43:06,959
It's just when they go past like an eight or nine sequence like more than seven or eight in a sequence

1486
06:43:06,959 --> 06:43:09,220
It's like god you have to like memorize

1487
06:43:10,520 --> 06:43:23,259
What?

1488
06:43:23,979 --> 06:43:29,159
I press A to do that

1489
06:43:47,459 --> 06:44:07,189
The midway point stay tuned that's that's the midway point I got it

1490
06:44:22,029 --> 06:45:09,849
Like to do this fan weird keyboard I get it right on

1491
06:45:47,819 --> 06:45:48,819
Oh

1492
06:45:48,819 --> 06:46:01,099
That's up. I thought that was hey, I thought it was hey, but that's up

1493
06:46:04,130 --> 06:46:08,159

1496
06:46:27,939 --> 06:46:29,939
Why have you never heard of this game?

1497
06:46:29,979 --> 06:46:37,069
It's very old. I think it was recently ported, but it's a very old game. It's very good though

1498
06:47:12,389 --> 06:47:25,830
I

1499
06:47:46,270 --> 06:47:53,750
Thought it was Michael's turn it wasn't Michael's turn that's still hey, that's still the little guy. I thought it was Michael I

1500
06:48:04,389 --> 06:48:18,599
Got it, but I press the wrong button now

1501
06:48:18,720 --> 06:48:28,979
Space Michael when the guy has the microphone. Is that really the way to work?

1502
06:49:14,900 --> 06:49:23,220

06:56:57,240 --> 06:57:01,279
So I fuck it up on purpose and the other half are trying to help me. It's very fun

1525
06:57:02,159 --> 06:58:02,090
Yes, I'm gonna just figure it out. I didn't do

1526
06:58:05,189 --> 06:58:10,819
We'll do it again tomorrow

1527
06:58:12,419 --> 06:58:20,619
We're gonna do it again tomorrow, I've been streaming for seven hours of this these dreamcast games

1528
06:58:21,139 --> 06:58:34,799
We'll fit wolf. Well, I'm gonna start with that tomorrow to rage quits in one night

1529
06:58:34,799 --> 06:58:37,680
What was the oh that Jetset radio doesn't count. I put like 20 minutes in that game

1530
06:58:38,119 --> 06:58:45,610
Wasn't him that that's space channel five part two. It's on Steam

1531
06:58:46,169 --> 06:58:55,880
It is a port of a dreamcast game and it's very good, but I want to come back fresh tomorrow

1532
06:58:55,880 --> 06:59:04,650
I'll play tomorrow. I'm gonna beat it tomorrow. It's gonna be fucking very fun. This game sucks. No

1533
06:59:05,169 --> 06:59:06,650
What are you talking about?

1534
06:59:06,650 --> 06:59:22,209
What how could you say that they get that game is so charming and fun and interesting

1535
06:59:22,849 --> 06:59:24,299
But anyways

1536
06:59:24,299 --> 06:59:28,900
We'll pick it up tomorrow. I've been going for seven hours now

1537
06:59:30,049 --> 06:59:34,569
After the bits will probably be about eight hours or so eight and a half. So it's getting late

1538
06:59:34,930 --> 06:59:38,450
It's like one almost 1 30 a.m. Eastern

1539
06:59:38,970 --> 06:59:43,279
Time it's time, you know, you gotta you gotta know when it's time to take a break like that one guy said

1540
06:59:43,580 --> 06:59:45,900
It's time to take a break man. I said, yeah, you know what? You're right

1541
06:59:46,459 --> 06:59:50,020
Sometimes you just gotta know

1542
06:59:50,020 --> 06:59:54,340
Crazy taxi fucking awesome game space to pit channel five amazing game ton of fun

1543
06:59:54,979 --> 06:59:59,500
Jet set radio it's hard to learn but with you if you sit down and give it the time necessary

1544
06:59:59,979 --> 07:00:04,819
About 10 to 20 hours, maybe 40 hours of time. You'll learn it and it's a very good game

1545
07:00:04,819 --> 07:00:07,639
I'm sure you'll enjoy it. These are all in the dreamcast collection

1546
07:00:08,220 --> 07:00:16,119
When I'm gonna play seaman when I get it reshipped

1547
07:00:16,659 --> 07:00:24,819
Because they got shipped to me with the microphone missing so I couldn't play it so I returned it

1548
07:00:25,220 --> 07:00:31,830
And I know another I have to get another one, but that's gonna wrap it up for tonight

1549
07:00:31,869 --> 07:00:40,689
I really like want to finish space chin. I'm so like into it right now, but there's only somebody choose instead of

1550
07:00:41,250 --> 07:00:45,529
Hayes that you can fuck up before you realize it's time. It's time to go get like food and

1551
07:00:46,610 --> 07:00:52,470
Do it again tomorrow. I had a lot of fun as always was a blast. Thanks everybody sticking around

1552

We to move on to the bits. I'll see you guys tomorrow for space channel 5 part 2 and then after that

1553
07:01:01,400 --> 07:01:07,130
It's kind of up in the air after that because that was kind of the that was the end of the dreamcast stuff

1554
07:01:12,520 --> 07:01:14,520
I'm looking forward to beating space channel

1555
07:01:14,599 --> 07:01:26,310
Space channel 5 part 2 part 2 that would be the title of the stream, but as always you guys rock

1556
07:01:26,590 --> 07:01:29,389
Thank you so much for sticking around here comes the outro

1557
07:01:29,909 --> 07:01:34,209
He rage quit even I didn't rage quit anything. I didn't rage quit. I

1558
07:01:35,799 --> 07:01:40,779
I just simply quit the game and put the controller down very very hard and

1559
07:01:42,770 --> 07:01:45,729
Air exhaled out of my nose very fast

1560
07:01:46,290 --> 07:01:50,430
That's not a rage quit. That is I ended the session of the game

1561
07:01:50,430 --> 07:01:58,189
I was playing and I'm gonna come back and do it again tomorrow with a little bit of rage you might say no

1562
07:01:58,189 --> 07:02:06,689
No, I wouldn't say that I would say with a slight discomfort level. Hey, is it a rage quit?

1563
07:02:06,689 --> 07:02:09,330
That's not a rage quit because I'm gonna I just I'm coming back and playing it tomorrow

1564
07:02:10,049 --> 07:02:15,979
Wouldn't a proper rage quit be that I'm not gonna ever play it again and fuck this game

1565
07:02:15,979 --> 07:02:22,880
I didn't did you ever hear me say fuck this game. Mm-hmm. I just simply am stopping my session

1566
07:02:22,880 --> 07:02:33,180
I'm gonna pick it up tomorrow, but let's uh move back in time here at about seven and a half hours ago

Permanently and the night sky is the new shirt that is back not back. It's here

1576
07:03:31,849 --> 07:03:34,130
Thank you Alec for the one dollar. Why does the resolution like like a

1577
07:03:34,889 --> 07:03:36,490
2007 Blackberry

1578
07:03:36,490 --> 07:03:43,180
Crossed with an Apple 2. Well, this came out before iPhones even existed. So the iPhone has

1579
07:03:44,180 --> 07:03:45,900
Apple 2 has

1580
07:03:45,900 --> 07:03:51,419
The graphics of the Dreamcast, you know, they copy the Dreamcast 2007 Blackberry

1581
07:03:51,860 --> 07:03:59,040
We think they got the idea from but thank you yet went for the one dollar

1582
07:04:00,099 --> 07:04:03,540
Fun fact. I'm not actually a professional artist. I just like to draw my free time

1583
07:04:04,139 --> 07:04:07,020
This time I have drawn a portrait of you in Shito

1584
07:04:08,930 --> 07:04:12,409
Once again, I prefer you just keep the link to the high-res image

1585
07:04:13,049 --> 07:04:23,849
Okay, if only I keep the link to the okay, I see I look forward to watching your reaction when you when I wake up

1586
07:04:23,849 --> 07:04:28,720
All right, cool. Let's see. I

1587
07:04:28,959 --> 07:04:35,599
There's no way that you just draw in your free time. This is just so good that like you like no way

1588
07:04:35,599 --> 07:04:39,939
That's unbelievable. I

1589
07:04:39,939 --> 07:04:43,259
Just draw on my frizz. It's like some of the most talented artwork I've ever seen

1590
07:04:43,700 --> 07:04:49,349
So if you just draw kind of in your free time for fun, you got quite the gift

1591
07:04:49,869 --> 07:04:51,869
That's fucking unbelievable

1592
07:04:52,069 --> 07:04:59,790
I'm gonna download it and just put it on stream. Let me just get it on the stream

1593
07:05:01,580 --> 07:05:05,939
For their wishes, I don't I'm not gonna give the high resolution download link

1594
07:05:06,459 --> 07:05:24,240
But it's their request. I'll get it on the screen here. Take a look at this. This is unbelievable

1595
07:05:24,919 --> 07:05:38,569
It's like looking into a mirror. Let's see

1596
07:05:39,209 --> 07:05:48,340
It's ridiculous

1597
07:05:48,340 --> 07:05:51,549
This is extremely high-res

1598
07:05:52,250 --> 07:06:08,639
That is truly amazing. Well, thank you so much for this

1599
07:06:09,360 --> 07:06:12,299
Look at that face

1600
07:06:12,299 --> 07:06:22,099
Even the eyes the eyes are just are perfect. Their eyes are perfect the mouth

1601
07:06:22,540 --> 07:06:25,869
How are people this talented?

1602
07:06:25,909 --> 07:06:32,659
Remember I told you about the aliens that possess people to like be crazy taxi in like 30 minutes

1603
07:06:32,659 --> 07:06:40,610
It'd be the whole thing get s-plus on every single exact everything that works in a lot of different places

1604
07:06:40,610 --> 07:06:49,909
I think you got skill. You got talent great work

1605
07:06:50,650 --> 07:07:03,590
Absolutely excellent work. Thank you so much for that yen with yen Wen Lin and thank you for the one dollar as well

1606
07:07:05,400 --> 07:07:12,000
Thank you some guy for the $15. So funny story. I didn't actually mean to post the Phantom of the Opera Overture twice

1607
07:07:12,000 --> 07:07:15,200
In fact, I don't even think it was my intent to post it once

1608
07:07:15,840 --> 07:07:18,209
But anyway, here's another video

1609
07:07:18,490 --> 07:07:20,490
Thank you for $15 and

1610
07:07:21,290 --> 07:07:23,569
Take a closer. Look at that snout

1611
07:07:24,650 --> 07:07:34,439
That's Phantom of the Opera again. It's a

1612
07:07:36,689 --> 07:07:39,979
Mouse rat thing. I don't know what this is

1613
07:07:42,389 --> 07:07:44,819
But it's very clearly Phantom of the Opera

1614
07:07:46,360 --> 07:07:54,560
So, thank you some guy for the $15 and the Phantom of the Opera. Hey father frogman. Thanks for the one dollar

1615
07:07:54,560 --> 07:08:01,799
Wow, Jeremy great stream. Love grandpa. Everybody loves grandpa. Thank you. Timmy Tim Tim for the one dollar

1616
07:08:02,240 --> 07:08:05,580
So how's the comb stream talk to chat stream idea coming along?

1617
07:08:05,880 --> 07:08:10,959
The classic comb streams where you just sit in front of the camera and talk or some real comedy German moments

1618
07:08:11,159 --> 07:08:13,159
And I'd love to see it become more of a regular thing

1619
07:08:13,520 --> 07:08:21,220
Yeah, I've thought about it before but here's the thing about stuff like that, right?

1620
07:08:21,419 --> 07:08:22,950
Ah

1621
07:08:22,950 --> 07:08:25,029
It's

1622
07:08:25,029 --> 07:08:31,000
Everything you've ever seen me do like on like the IRL streams just kind of happened, right?

1623
07:08:31,000 --> 07:08:34,279
It wasn't like here I'm gonna plan this and I'm gonna do that and here we go

1624
07:08:34,279 --> 07:08:36,279
Yeah, this is the thing. I'm gonna do is a bit today

1625
07:08:36,799 --> 07:08:42,720
We kind of just sit there and it just happens. So, I don't know planning out IRL streams in particular

1626
07:08:42,720 --> 07:08:44,360
I don't know if I if it's a good idea anymore

1627
07:08:44,360 --> 07:08:49,240
I feel like they naturally will just happen when they need to and when they will I

1628
07:08:49,659 --> 07:08:59,709
Feel the same way about a lot of different other pieces of content, right?

1629
07:09:00,270 --> 07:09:09,189
Stuff just kind of naturally has to happen and putting myself on like a once a week or once every oh, it's the comb stream

1630
07:09:09,189 --> 07:09:12,430
Here we go. Here comes the comedy. Like here it comes

1631
07:09:13,430 --> 07:09:21,860
That's not gonna really work because that's not how I operate. So just stream yourself sleeping

1632
07:09:25,119 --> 07:09:28,549
You can't do that on Twitch you get banned

1633
07:09:28,549 --> 07:09:38,509
I mean some of the most fun moments I've ever had on this stream came from things that I didn't even know was

1634
07:09:38,509 --> 07:09:47,669
Gonna happen until 10 seconds before they happened. I mean take that as you will I guess but that's sort of how it works

1635
07:09:48,270 --> 07:09:56,009
Can't wait for the next funny Friday

1636
07:09:56,409 --> 07:10:12,240
Like accidentally being naked. Yeah, like that was a funny plan thing. I was pretend. Everybody knows that but thank you Timmy Tim tan

1637
07:10:12,240 --> 07:10:18,869
Thank you c4g for the $1 and they say please give us pins of germa Jax

1638
07:10:21,060 --> 07:10:24,720
Teespring does not just do t-shirts anymore. I think I can make

1639
07:10:25,319 --> 07:10:27,069
phone cases

1640
07:10:27,069 --> 07:10:30,090
Wallets keys. Well, you know you get the idea

1641
07:10:36,180 --> 07:10:38,180
socks Pikachu socks

1642
07:10:38,659 --> 07:10:41,750
Whale plushies, you know, there's all this plenty of options

1643
07:10:42,270 --> 07:10:48,009
So that storefront if you notice if you go to like the store

1644
07:10:48,810 --> 07:10:51,250
teespring.com slash stores the germa 985

1645
07:10:52,049 --> 07:10:53,450
It's all just there

1646
07:10:53,450 --> 07:10:58,529
So any other pieces of merchandise that I want to do through teespring will just go up on that storefront

1647
07:10:59,049 --> 07:11:13,540
those shirts aren't coming down things will just be added over time and if it's out of the

1648
07:11:14,340 --> 07:11:18,659
Wheelhouse of teespring and it's something else that I want to do then I'll put it somewhere else, right?

1649
07:11:19,139 --> 07:11:27,810
But thank you lazy Luke for the $1. I will spend all my money of my bank account for the night sky shirt

1650
07:11:28,209 --> 07:11:31,159
Well, I hope you don't spend all your money in your bank account

1651
07:11:31,439 --> 07:11:36,840
If you have enough money to buy that shirt and it's something that you want and you think you're gonna wear it

1652
07:11:37,360 --> 07:11:43,110
And by all means, but I really don't I really hope you don't clear out your bank account to buy that shirt

1653
07:11:43,490 --> 07:11:46,110
It'll be around for a long time. You got plenty of time to do it

1654
07:11:46,509 --> 07:11:54,759
Thank you tingy for the $1 Saturn is popular chat will spam germa Saturn now just watch

1655
07:11:55,360 --> 07:11:57,560
Well somebody mentioned they might be on Saturn

1656
07:11:57,819 --> 07:12:07,220
So that's the ultimate part of that t-shirt because you are Saturn. They're standing on you which is Saturn or mercury depending

1657
07:12:07,500 --> 07:12:13,590
Thank you. Ike turtle for the $1. Yo, I got a question about that shirt

1658
07:12:13,590 --> 07:12:16,869
Why are you why are we just spying on this family through a telescope?

1659
07:12:17,229 --> 07:12:25,340
These are these are questions that I don't have an answer to thank you Todd for the $1

1660
07:12:25,340 --> 07:12:27,340
Hey, it's time for some crazy taxi

1661
07:12:27,860 --> 07:12:35,150
Thank You demonic cucumber for the $1. Hey, it's Alex

1662
07:12:35,150 --> 07:12:38,470
I know the reason why you didn't stream yesterday because you were busy cremating the late Jerma

1663
07:12:38,470 --> 07:12:44,150
I guess she toe hasn't appeared because he can't handle the grief. Anyway, Jerma would have made a spill joke by now

1664
07:12:44,150 --> 07:12:45,689
Just the heads up

1665
07:12:45,689 --> 07:12:55,860
Thank You Marvosh McGally for the $1 petition to make an egg t-shirt next

1666
07:12:56,340 --> 07:13:05,650
Also a reminder for chat that this video exists video exists. This is

1667
07:13:06,529 --> 07:13:09,779
This is Bergboy puking

1668
07:13:09,779 --> 07:13:17,740
Yeah, that's a video on my channel of one of my friends throwing up on camera. He's laughing so hard at a game

1669
07:13:17,740 --> 07:13:19,740
That's one of my favorite videos, by the way

1670
07:13:23,169 --> 07:13:25,650
This is this is one of my favorite videos on my whole channel

1671
07:13:28,490 --> 07:13:41,060
Yeah

1672
07:13:41,900 --> 07:13:57,580
It is like house oh

1673
07:13:57,740 --> 07:13:59,340
the memories

1674
07:13:59,340 --> 07:14:01,650
good old YouTube

1675
07:14:01,770 --> 07:14:04,669
2012 burger boy fuking on webcam

1676
07:14:05,330 --> 07:14:13,229
So yeah that there it is. I have so much of vivid moments vivid memories of that

1677
07:14:14,029 --> 07:14:20,540
Exact video he was laughing. We were laughing so hard

1678
07:14:21,020 --> 07:14:28,909
He just threw up. I think he was drinking something out of like a big baby cup, too

1679
07:14:28,909 --> 07:14:36,830
I don't know idea who's drinking like booze or something. But anyways, thank you Marvish McGally

1680
07:14:37,950 --> 07:14:39,950
demonic cucumber. Thanks for the $1 also

1681
07:14:40,590 --> 07:14:42,349
Is the shirt edible?

1682
07:14:42,349 --> 07:14:51,330
What shirt the shirt like my shirts they made out of the most premium material you wouldn't want to eat those

1683
07:14:51,770 --> 07:14:55,479
Hey Davis, thanks for the two bucks Davis

1684
07:14:55,880 --> 07:15:01,840
Dork cube. Thanks for the $1 all these screaming punk singers in extremely dangerous driving reminds me of when

1685
07:15:02,680 --> 07:15:04,680
My sister got her license

1686
07:15:04,919 --> 07:15:10,659
punk singers

1687
07:15:10,700 --> 07:15:16,970
Anything is edible at least once. Well, I mean could you eat that shirt?

1688
07:15:17,529 --> 07:15:18,970
You could

1689
07:15:18,970 --> 07:15:21,520
It would be incredibly ill-advised

1690
07:15:22,080 --> 07:15:23,880
That would be a very bad idea

1691
07:15:23,880 --> 07:15:28,639
You would get sick something bad you did you get like a blockage in your attack that you can't you shouldn't do that

1692
07:15:28,720 --> 07:15:30,400
Do not do that

1693
07:15:30,400 --> 07:15:33,689
It technically is you could

1694
07:15:34,330 --> 07:15:47,849
But do not do it. I'm gonna eat it. I didn't tell you to I'm telling you right now. Do not do that

1695
07:15:49,409 --> 07:16:06,099
Absolutely, do not consume that shirt wear it run from it. Thank you door cube again for the $1

1696
07:16:08,830 --> 07:16:11,750
Fat fart master. Okay, never mind

1697
07:16:13,389 --> 07:16:15,630
Thank you Jebediah for the

1698
07:16:16,349 --> 07:16:26,639
$10 you ever gonna post on the main channel again. I have no plan to we've gone over it more than a

1699
07:16:27,040 --> 07:16:29,220
dozen times at this point

1700
07:16:29,259 --> 07:16:36,619
Probably not that channel is gonna stay there. It's never gonna come down but in the current landscape of how

1701
07:16:38,740 --> 07:16:42,959
Things work right now on twitch. I don't have time to make a video

1702
07:16:43,419 --> 07:16:45,970
I really don't

1703
07:16:45,970 --> 07:16:48,209
Streaming I used to make a video once a week

1704
07:16:48,529 --> 07:16:55,279
But now instead of making a video that takes me four days to make you know

1705
07:16:55,380 --> 07:17:02,130
Four or five days to make it or come up with an idea now. I just stream four days a week

1706
07:17:04,220 --> 07:17:17,720
Sometimes less sometimes more and I'm not going to just make a video because I have to if that makes any sense

1707
07:17:18,159 --> 07:17:21,090
I'm not going to just be like I got to make a video

1708
07:17:21,090 --> 07:17:24,610
I have to because then that's not why I wanted to make a video in the first place

1709
07:17:24,650 --> 07:17:33,819
I will never phone in a stream. I will never phone in a video. I just I don't want to that's not why I want to

1710
07:17:33,819 --> 07:17:38,700
Do it. So hey, well, you got to make a new video on the main channel. It's like I but I don't

1711
07:17:40,689 --> 07:17:41,930
because

1712
07:17:41,930 --> 07:17:47,139
Going back and trying to do a video just because I have to do a video

1713
07:17:47,500 --> 07:17:55,659
That's not gonna happen. The magic will not be there the it just won't feel fun

1714
07:17:55,659 --> 07:18:02,619
It won't be something I'm interested in currently all of my interests right now are on trying to make like live

1715
07:18:03,419 --> 07:18:07,080
Stuff and obviously since the move to Vegas

1716
07:18:07,080 --> 07:18:15,919
You've already seen a handful of streams that have taken a lot more time to make and like I said once every like 30 to 40

1717
07:18:15,919 --> 07:18:19,900
Days, you're gonna see something else. It just depends on exactly what I want to do

1718
07:18:19,900 --> 07:18:24,259
But that is the new interest in the new thing that I want to try

1719
07:18:24,259 --> 07:18:36,169
I don't know what you could upload that people won't be upset about at this point. Yeah, but there's

1720
07:18:36,849 --> 07:18:39,919
There are a million reasons why?

1721
07:18:40,000 --> 07:18:49,860
But I've I'm not gonna just do it if I get the urge and it's like something that I want to do and hey

1722
07:18:50,459 --> 07:18:53,099
This would be great as a YouTube video

1723
07:18:53,099 --> 07:18:56,360
Maybe I'll work on it and try to put it up and now obviously we'd talk about it

1724
07:18:56,360 --> 07:19:00,060
But I want to try to transition to more

1725
07:19:01,340 --> 07:19:18,830
Experience live experience based content because it's fun and it has to be it's a natural progression, right? Because

1726
07:19:19,349 --> 07:19:24,000
You we talked about it literally 20 minutes ago. Not even I

1727
07:19:24,400 --> 07:19:28,270
I

1728
07:19:28,270 --> 07:19:30,790
Need to be interested. I have to be

1729
07:19:31,470 --> 07:19:36,229
It's just not it's not something that I can do. I'm not capable of

1730
07:19:36,950 --> 07:19:45,619
Putting a face on and uploading a video because I want to but I'm sorry that a lot of people don't want to hear that

1731
07:19:46,099 --> 07:19:53,799
But I don't I'm not gonna like lie to everybody and be like just wait a six more months and there'll be

1732
07:19:54,200 --> 07:19:59,479
Jerma Rumble to Jerma Rumble live to is going what is gonna be a live broadcast

1733
07:20:00,400 --> 07:20:02,400
Actually on twitch, that's what I want to do

1734
07:20:02,680 --> 07:20:07,229
No one's ever done something like that before. No one's ever tried to do something like that. I don't think and

1735
07:20:07,869 --> 07:20:14,720
Neither have I that's something I've never tried to attempt before so I've slowly been trying to do more live

1736
07:20:15,400 --> 07:20:25,979
Showy type stuff to test the waters to see how possible I think it is the WWE

1737
07:20:25,979 --> 07:20:28,639
Yeah, I mean the WWE has like a thousand employee

1738
07:20:28,639 --> 07:20:42,240
I'm talking about like eight people with like 20 actors and people maybe with

1739
07:20:42,880 --> 07:20:48,240
something with extensions could like vote on who could get eliminated or

1740
07:20:48,840 --> 07:20:51,080
Maybe you could vote on who comes in next

1741
07:20:51,520 --> 07:21:05,299
stuff like that is what interests me right now and over the few months coming years that I want to try to

1742
07:21:06,799 --> 07:21:12,139
Level up to that and right now. It's a lot of meeting people checking out studios

1743
07:21:13,000 --> 07:21:17,849
Talking to the right people getting the right position where it's something I could do and so far

1744
07:21:17,849 --> 07:21:27,880
I think I'm on the right path. We'll see but hopefully that answers your question

1745
07:21:28,520 --> 07:21:36,549
Thank you Peter for the three dollars and 85 cents. I had your stream audio for crazy taxi playing during my drive home

1746
07:21:36,549 --> 07:21:43,689
I'll just say that the honking tire screeching and screaming made for a great 4d driving experience. Oh

1747
07:21:45,540 --> 07:21:50,009
Jesus I

1748
07:21:50,009 --> 07:21:53,970
Make sure the volume is at a level where you're not gonna get confused

1749
07:21:54,569 --> 07:22:05,310
Be careful take make sure you're driving safely and you can pay attention to all your surroundings. Oh my god

1750
07:22:05,790 --> 07:22:12,740
But thank you Peter

1751
07:22:12,740 --> 07:22:18,500
Smelly boy. Thanks for the one dollar. They've redid the entire let it go song from frozen in Kingdom Hearts 3

1752
07:22:19,139 --> 07:22:24,650
Only differences Sora Donald and goofy are sitting in the background and it's hilarious. I

1753
07:22:25,250 --> 07:22:42,290
Can't play this on stream. I'll go to jail. Oh, by the way

1754
07:22:42,930 --> 07:22:48,330
An idea that I had for German Rumble live. You guys might think this is funny because it's pretty relevant

1755
07:22:48,330 --> 07:22:50,009
I didn't want to go to jail though

1756
07:22:50,009 --> 07:22:54,490
It was gonna just start snowing and this was gonna play and it was Elsa was gonna come out

1757
07:22:54,930 --> 07:23:00,930
The snow was gonna just start falling under the ring and Elsa was gonna be like a contestant

1758
07:23:01,650 --> 07:23:06,540
Everyone's gonna stop and like look don't worry. I got fucking a million tricks up my sleeve

1759
07:23:06,540 --> 07:23:08,500
You don't even know about some of the other ones

1760
07:23:08,500 --> 07:23:13,869
That that was like a bad

1761
07:23:13,909 --> 07:23:18,150
Not funny version of like 30 other contestants. So don't worry

1762
07:23:18,150 --> 07:23:25,990
I got I got an entire German Rumble live two three and four upstairs

1763
07:23:26,450 --> 07:23:30,220
But I ain't going to jail so I can't play that whole video. Thank you

1764
07:23:31,509 --> 07:23:36,669
Brawler thanks for the five dollars. That is not how you drive a taxi. It is how you do it in crazy taxi

1765
07:23:36,950 --> 07:23:43,529
Hey demonic cucumber. Thanks for the one dollar

1766
07:23:43,529 --> 07:23:48,810
I'm starting to have serious doubts in my theory that italics is doing the streams now because only Jeremy could come up with

1767
07:23:48,810 --> 07:23:55,729
Something as batshit crazy as skin aliens and possession by gamer powers because it must have been in his mad ramblings before he died

1768
07:23:56,490 --> 07:24:03,180
There are a few different theories as to how people are so good at video games

1769
07:24:03,840 --> 07:24:07,979
theory one alien gamers possession spirits theory two

1770
07:24:09,279 --> 07:24:17,319
Highly skilled video game players see the world at point nine eight speed. We've already talked about that one

1771
07:24:17,319 --> 07:24:22,830
I'm convinced you just you have that edge

1772
07:24:23,229 --> 07:24:30,069
You see the world in like point nine seven not slow enough for it to really have it be a superpower

1773
07:24:30,229 --> 07:24:51,029
But slow enough where you have like an edge somebody should test it point now at nine eight is now point nine seven

1774
07:24:51,409 --> 07:24:53,869
Point nine seven ratio fighting game players. Yeah

1775
07:24:54,409 --> 07:24:58,500
It's like it's like trying to catch a fly

1776
07:24:59,020 --> 07:25:05,959
In the air you have to see the world at like point nine six

1777
07:25:06,479 --> 07:25:12,799
It's not your humans can't do that unless you have the superpower that lets you slow down time

1778
07:25:13,040 --> 07:25:18,490
Permanently by just a tiny bit and then they grab the fly and it's like, oh, you know people can't do that

1779
07:25:18,490 --> 07:25:30,259
You must have fucking powers you can train reflexes with practice. You could probably bring it down to like point nine nine

1780
07:25:30,259 --> 07:25:38,869
I don't know about point nine eight or nine seven though. Do you see the world at one point?

1781
07:25:38,869 --> 07:25:40,509
0.02 probably I

1782
07:25:40,509 --> 07:25:45,869
Bet I see the world like point I probably see the world at one point 14

1783
07:25:45,869 --> 07:25:57,450
I want to test this theory one day

1784
07:25:57,450 --> 07:26:01,930
I want to like clap at the same time or like try to grab something and send and see

1785
07:26:02,450 --> 07:26:05,529
What the aren't there apps and games that do this?

1786
07:26:06,009 --> 07:26:10,060
There's like a click when the there's a click when it's a green light, right?

1787
07:26:10,060 --> 07:26:18,919
Isn't that a game and you can see how fast your reaction is. I have to do that next dream

1788
07:26:19,240 --> 07:26:29,139
It's a reaction test. Yeah, we're gonna do that next dream. I can't do it now. Am I I've got gamer fatigue

1789
07:26:29,560 --> 07:26:33,830
It won't be an accurate representation of my skills

1790
07:26:34,470 --> 07:26:46,659
But anyways, thank you demonic cucumber

1791
07:26:47,259 --> 07:26:52,569
Thank you. Just for the one dollar. Hey, Jerem, you're not becoming a mutant boomer who hates everything not yet

1792
07:26:52,569 --> 07:27:03,069
At least here's my parting gift. Nobody actually likes this game. Do they?

1793
07:27:03,669 --> 07:27:27,639
Kidding. I'm kidding. I love Kingdom Hearts 1 & 2. I'm just kidding. It's a joke guys. It's just a joke

1794
07:27:27,639 --> 07:27:31,509
I've loved going to the movie theater and watching

1795
07:27:32,150 --> 07:27:39,639
Seven movies in a row and then swinging a sword around for five seconds and then going back in the theater and

1796
07:27:40,119 --> 07:27:50,610
Watching like six more movies was it like 16 hours of cutscenes in that game

1797
07:28:00,060 --> 07:28:04,479
Metal Gear Solid 4 I think Metal Gear has less cutscene which figure it out. Let's find out

1798
07:28:05,119 --> 07:28:12,080
What has more cutscenes across the whole franchise Metal Gear Solid or Kingdom Hearts?

1799
07:28:12,080 --> 07:28:22,709
I think Kingdom Hearts 2 has like 14 hours of cutscenes

1800
07:28:23,389 --> 07:28:27,150
Metal Gear

1801
07:28:27,709 --> 07:28:39,119
Has like a hundred hours of cutscenes Metal Gear Solid 4 has 74 71 minutes. Is that no, it's not real

1802
07:28:39,520 --> 07:28:51,779
It's got seven games and then you called me an idiot. How dare you?

1803
07:28:52,380 --> 07:29:06,439
Kingdom Hearts 3 actually has a fictional Square Enix anime bullshit game inside the universe of Toy Story

1804
07:29:07,200 --> 07:29:15,880
Yeah, but here's the thing like Kingdom Hearts, right?

1805
07:29:16,919 --> 07:29:19,799
Kingdom Hearts was a really great idea

1806
07:29:20,400 --> 07:29:26,599
Really great games there there there are very good games. They're incredibly detailed. There's a lot to do

1807
07:29:26,599 --> 07:29:32,599
There's a lot to see they brought together all the Disney worlds and it was but you could go to Jack Skellington

1808
07:29:32,599 --> 07:29:34,639
And then from there you could go to Winnie the Pooh

1809
07:29:34,639 --> 07:29:40,080
It was like the biggest Infinity War crossover event in history for video games

1810
07:29:40,080 --> 07:29:46,439
It just was and then they came up with the second one and they even added more there was more to do

1811
07:29:46,439 --> 07:29:47,900
There's more to see. Oh, that's awesome

1812
07:29:47,900 --> 07:29:52,259
Cool, and then the second one and even in the end of the first one they kind of just said hey

1813
07:29:52,979 --> 07:29:55,099
instead of it being about like Disney characters and and

1814
07:29:55,619 --> 07:30:04,189
You know being like a good person and Kingdom Hearts is a door they went so far off the rails to a point what?

1815
07:30:05,270 --> 07:30:07,950
There's so much random shit going on that

1816
07:30:09,650 --> 07:30:14,029
It's almost like they have nine movies playing at the same time

1817
07:30:15,110 --> 07:30:19,409
Pausing four of them halfway through letting the other five play

1818
07:30:19,849 --> 07:30:23,770
pausing those going back and letting the other four play for like two hours and

1819
07:30:24,090 --> 07:30:32,500
Then turning them all off the game came out like what 13 14 years later

1820
07:30:32,900 --> 07:30:36,599
They were like a bunch of other random games in the middle

1821
07:30:36,599 --> 07:30:39,919
There was like a DS like a Gameboy Advance games that were part of the story

1822
07:30:40,439 --> 07:30:51,229
They had to like catch people up. It's like there's a lot going on and they're all canon

1823
07:30:51,590 --> 07:31:00,040
Wow, but that's what I mean

1824
07:31:00,040 --> 07:31:03,240
They got like movies from a decade ago playing in the background for you

1825
07:31:03,520 --> 07:31:06,279
Well, you have the current movie playing in front of you

1826
07:31:06,560 --> 07:31:13,990
The problem with King of Hearts is they released a shit ton of games on handhelds

1827
07:31:13,990 --> 07:31:16,150
But didn't actually tell you they were part of the story

1828
07:31:16,830 --> 07:31:24,139
But jokes aside

1829
07:31:24,139 --> 07:31:28,619
If you if you like Kingdom Hearts and you were excited for it, then that's great

1830
07:31:28,619 --> 07:31:32,000
I'm not that's awesome because let's be real about it

1831
07:31:32,540 --> 07:31:36,159
Hey finished the day actually finished their fucking story

1832
07:31:36,799 --> 07:31:41,490
They actually did it took them a long time, but they did it they announced it and here it is and it's done

1833
07:31:41,490 --> 07:31:46,970
I can name you a couple of companies that have not done that that everybody really wishes they did

1834
07:31:47,529 --> 07:31:55,759
Let me know they didn't Kingdom Hearts 3 is not the end

1835
07:31:56,279 --> 07:32:08,319
Kingdom wait Kingdom Hearts 3 is not the end of Kingdom Hearts. Oh, don't spoil anything, but hold on wait what?

1836
07:32:09,119 --> 07:32:10,959
Well, whatever they

1837
07:32:10,959 --> 07:32:16,659
My whole point is completely moot here that just a bit

1838
07:32:16,700 --> 07:32:22,500
Yeah, but this done what that's like saying Half-Life 3 never came out, but it didn't but if Half-Life 3 came out

1839
07:32:23,060 --> 07:32:29,470
Maybe there would be more Half-Life games like offshoots and Kingdom Hearts 1 2 3 done

1840
07:32:29,950 --> 07:32:39,709
That storyline is done. They thought they did it but regardless

1841
07:32:39,709 --> 07:32:43,860
I don't want to like rain on anybody's parade for

1842
07:32:45,029 --> 07:32:50,250
Liking Kingdom Hearts because I do I thought I think it's good. I played this shit out of those games the first two

1843
07:32:50,490 --> 07:32:52,490
I'll probably end up playing the third one

1844
07:32:52,849 --> 07:33:02,159
But there's a lot of strange things going on in that series and it's kind of bounces all over the place

1845
07:33:02,639 --> 07:33:11,020
to a point where it has gotten to Metal Gear level of

1846
07:33:11,540 --> 07:33:18,229
What is that? Who is that? Why is that? And in my opinion, I don't know if you should be making I don't you're making those

1847
07:33:18,990 --> 07:33:24,619
Statements during a Disney game. Why is that? Who is that? Where is that?

1848
07:33:25,180 --> 07:33:45,860
Donald Duck is Donald Duck is just hanging out in the background. Why I got a Coca-Cola writer. I got a Pepsi

1849
07:33:46,060 --> 07:33:48,060
That's not even whatever I need to hydrate

1850
07:33:48,580 --> 07:33:52,500
That's not water

1851
07:33:52,500 --> 07:34:01,020
But I'll probably play it. I will probably play it

1852
07:34:05,389 --> 07:34:09,599
By the way, I just realized what happened there. So

1853
07:34:10,639 --> 07:34:16,330
I got a one dollar from Jess who said you're not becoming a mutant boomer who hates everything and you linked

1854
07:34:16,729 --> 07:34:24,439
The King that's then I went off on Kingdom Hearts. So you just played me like an absolute fiddle here

1855
07:34:24,799 --> 07:34:31,799
That was very well done. Very well done

1856
07:34:34,740 --> 07:34:37,750
Thank you

1857
07:34:38,229 --> 07:34:42,099
My can't my brain. Thank you phylactery

1858
07:34:43,060 --> 07:34:45,060
phylactery for the $15

1859
07:34:45,700 --> 07:34:50,459
Dermot, you're so handsome. I have to be careful not to watch your stream and my girlfriend's around take this money

1860
07:34:50,459 --> 07:34:52,619
Do you appease your rugged good looks?

1861
07:34:53,380 --> 07:35:06,369
Thank you. Appreciate it. Metal Gear story is just as bad. Don't kid yourself chat

1862
07:35:07,090 --> 07:35:13,409
Oh Kingdom Hearts story versus Metal Gear story

1863
07:35:14,009 --> 07:35:19,139
Which one did you quit halfway through because you went oh, please. Oh

1864
07:35:20,619 --> 07:35:32,240
Both of them

1865
07:35:32,240 --> 07:35:41,709
Metal Gear is fine until four

1866
07:35:41,990 --> 07:35:45,599
Metal Gear 3 is well

1867
07:35:45,599 --> 07:35:48,520
I mean you got it at three is then this is then five and then five isn't

1868
07:35:48,759 --> 07:35:54,439
the beginning of one and then one is then two and then two is then four and then two actually is

1869
07:35:55,159 --> 07:36:00,040
Not even in it's like it's based on a whole nother storyline

1870
07:36:00,639 --> 07:36:11,830
Then there's in the middle of five you got the the Michael Jackson

1871
07:36:12,909 --> 07:36:14,069
hee-hee

1872
07:36:14,069 --> 07:36:16,700
Except it's more of a ha ha

1873
07:36:16,819 --> 07:36:40,790
Right. Nah close enough. What a great sound effect by the way

1874
07:36:41,349 --> 07:36:48,700
When you smoke that cigar, it's that's I love that part of that game. I love that games a great game

1875
07:36:49,220 --> 07:36:52,020
We talk about good games

1876
07:36:52,020 --> 07:36:55,130
Look at solid five is good

1877
07:36:55,130 --> 07:37:05,090
Anyway, saran wrap. Thanks for the three bucks

1878
07:37:05,090 --> 07:37:08,090
It'd be great to see Evo search for Eden on a future stream

1879
07:37:08,250 --> 07:37:12,250
It's a childhood favorite of mine and kind of like seventh cross was good

1880
07:37:12,729 --> 07:37:21,139
Much love. Thank you saran wraps and I'll type it into Google and I'll see what the hell it is

1881
07:37:21,340 --> 07:37:26,959
You're playing Metal Gear Solid 3 for the first time. That is I think that's probably my favorite one

1882
07:37:27,439 --> 07:37:34,639
In fact, Metal Gear Solid 3 is probably the only one that I would go back and play again

1883
07:37:34,919 --> 07:37:47,770
Is that strange the first two were very

1884
07:37:48,630 --> 07:37:49,830
classic

1885
07:37:49,830 --> 07:37:51,349
classic pieces of

1886
07:37:51,349 --> 07:37:58,049
Cinema right video game cinema, but gameplay wise I think I'd rather go back and play three

1887
07:37:58,529 --> 07:38:09,020
More than any of them. Here's think about four. I have not played four

1888
07:38:09,020 --> 07:38:16,830
I tried to start for but I just ran out of time ran out of I just I couldn't grab me and I stopped playing it

1889
07:38:17,270 --> 07:38:25,779
Four is good, but it's too long for replays

1890
07:38:26,299 --> 07:38:35,250
Yeah, I think Metal Gear Solid 3 sits somewhere right in the perfect little place for length gameplay

1891
07:38:36,470 --> 07:38:43,770
Storyline cutscenes. I love the boss encounters. I love the but I'm not gonna spoil anything because I don't know who's played it

1892
07:38:44,250 --> 07:38:46,250
but the different the

1893
07:38:46,810 --> 07:38:48,729
the different does

1894
07:38:48,729 --> 07:38:55,040
There's a great. I love I just love that. It's it's got a I can't really say anything, but you know what I'm talking about

1895
07:38:55,720 --> 07:39:05,979
Maybe I will go back and play three again a great game

1896
07:39:06,459 --> 07:39:10,540
the

1897
07:39:10,540 --> 07:39:16,080
The existence of the Cobra unit isn't exactly a spoiler. No

1898
07:39:16,740 --> 07:39:23,700
But a couple of those characters you really if somebody was gonna play through to the further the first time ever

1899
07:39:24,259 --> 07:39:26,540
I'm not sure you'd want to start saying some of those names

1900
07:39:27,060 --> 07:39:29,619
Because you know

1901
07:39:30,450 --> 07:39:34,009
Thank you. Hero of trains is for the $1

1902
07:39:34,569 --> 07:39:35,930
Hey German longtime fan here

1903
07:39:35,930 --> 07:39:41,689
Just want to say that Sonic Adventure DX needs its own stream. It actually has a story as opposed to some of these arcade games

1904
07:39:42,450 --> 07:39:46,159
Space Channel 5 has a story and

1905
07:39:48,939 --> 07:40:02,659
Michael Jackson's in that one. So I we got to go back and beat that one. They scream their names throughout the game. Oh

1906
07:40:06,419 --> 07:40:10,819
I forgot about some of those characters. This is so good

1907
07:40:11,380 --> 07:40:25,220
Oh, I could I'm just gushing about Metal Gear Solid 3 but Sonic was a fun game. I didn't not like it

1908
07:40:25,459 --> 07:40:29,340
I'm just not into the whole story Sonic

1909
07:40:29,979 --> 07:40:31,380
world

1910
07:40:31,380 --> 07:40:38,500
Sonic the game I love Sonic the world and Sonic the characters. I really am not it doesn't it doesn't really do much for me

1911
07:40:39,259 --> 07:40:42,630
Sonic the video game is phenomenal

1912
07:40:42,990 --> 07:40:47,990
But in my opinion, I'm not a big like huge fan of the Sonic world

1913
07:40:55,849 --> 07:40:58,770
Dirty Margaret, thanks for the $10. This music is pleasing

1914
07:40:59,209 --> 07:41:03,240
I'm not sure what you're referring to but maybe you're talking about the music from crazy taxi

1915
07:41:03,680 --> 07:41:08,860
Dork cube. Thanks for the $1

1916
07:41:08,860 --> 07:41:13,580
How much of Sonic 06 have you seen because if you haven't seen much I would suggest you play it for a laugh

1917
07:41:13,979 --> 07:41:18,180
Well, actually the chat will be laughing. You'll be full of rage trying not to throw the controller at the screen

1918
07:41:20,740 --> 07:41:23,959
Sonic 06 I have seen it played I have

1919
07:41:24,900 --> 07:41:30,799
Played pieces of it. That's the one where there's the Elsa's in that game, right?

1920
07:41:31,939 --> 07:41:33,939
You're in like the weird human world and

1921
07:41:35,340 --> 07:41:37,340
There's all those weird cutscenes where you

1922
07:41:37,939 --> 07:41:48,619
Yes, so I'm thinking of the right game. I don't remember much. I didn't get very far and

1923
07:41:51,930 --> 07:41:59,520
I said I made a lot of people very angry at the beginning of this stream. Oh this game sucks, right Sonic adventure

1924
07:41:59,520 --> 07:42:05,049
This is this one is a terrible one and that was I was thinking of 06. So I apologize again for that one

1925
07:42:11,610 --> 07:42:17,919
Snoozing copter. Thanks for the $1. Hey pst. Jerma. Did you know that there's an actual casino in Godhand?

1926
07:42:18,400 --> 07:42:23,979
Slot machines and blackjack. I'm just the guy with the bits that reminds you to play Godhand until you do it

1927
07:42:24,520 --> 07:42:26,520
What have I become do it?

1928
07:42:29,569 --> 07:42:35,529
I think I bought Godhand digitally and gave my PlayStation 3 away

1929
07:42:36,849 --> 07:42:41,819
I think that's what happened. I have to get it again

1930
07:42:42,419 --> 07:42:48,250
Excuse me. Sorry

1931
07:42:48,250 --> 07:42:56,369
Mini clips. Thank you mini clips for the $14 and 35 cents. No message nearly $15

1932
07:42:56,369 --> 07:43:00,970
Thank you so much and on top of your other huge contributions. Thank you so much mini clips

1933
07:43:04,159 --> 07:43:07,919
Dragon zero hexa. Thanks for the $1 place some dirty overwatch League

1934
07:43:09,500 --> 07:43:12,380
Overwatch League 2000. I'm not gonna play overwatch

1935
07:43:12,939 --> 07:43:27,299
I'm not gonna play overwatch. That's I moved on. I'm glad that people can play that game and enjoy it

1936
07:43:27,299 --> 07:43:29,299
I'm glad people can play any game and enjoy it

1937
07:43:29,340 --> 07:43:36,189
But I got my time in overwatch. I had my fun in overwatch. I just I've moved on it's not something

1938
07:43:36,189 --> 07:43:37,709
I'm probably ever gonna play again

1939
07:43:37,709 --> 07:43:45,680
Unless they make me as a character if the next overwatch character is Jerma and it's me and I have a hook

1940
07:43:46,119 --> 07:43:51,799
that I can kind of stick it into walls and like throw myself and it's a movement ability and

1941
07:43:52,319 --> 07:43:58,759
In my right hand is a three burst shotgun. It goes boom boom boom

1942
07:43:59,599 --> 07:44:01,599
boom boom boom

1943
07:44:01,880 --> 07:44:11,069
And you have to be pretty close range and then my ultimate would be I turn into a top and other people can

1944
07:44:11,709 --> 07:44:14,509
You can these two other people on the team have to throw me

1945
07:44:14,990 --> 07:44:18,389
So it's a three-person ultimate kind of I can't use it unless there's two people around me

1946
07:44:18,990 --> 07:44:38,270
Boom boom top. There's a Beyblade. Yeah, and I would I would have to cost fifty fucking dollars and every cent

1947
07:44:38,790 --> 07:44:54,360
Goes directly to charity. It's the only way I would do it. But thank you to dork cube

1948
07:44:54,799 --> 07:44:59,729
For the $1 this just in local streamer expects real gambling games in children's Sonic game

1949
07:45:00,209 --> 07:45:02,639
They had a slot machine in there

1950
07:45:03,099 --> 07:45:13,380
Inside that pinball machine. There was a slot. It exists. Thank you, bro. Look for the $5, dude you by

1951
07:45:14,000 --> 07:45:22,270
Fucking brain, please stop the fever dream Sonic game. It wasn't that bad. It was okay

1952
07:45:22,549 --> 07:45:32,750
This is pretty good music in that game. Thank you. Errorless for the $1 Jerma Earth

1953
07:45:33,110 --> 07:45:37,020
I'm gonna be rocking that shirt when it comes in for sure

1954
07:45:37,979 --> 07:45:41,500
Thank you to no

1955
07:45:42,340 --> 07:45:49,979
No, one three four for the multiple bits here and they say go back to fucking Sonic fucking go back to Sonic

1956
07:45:50,580 --> 07:45:55,009
I can't and

1957
07:45:55,009 --> 07:45:58,830
crazy taxi space channel five those my top picks and

1958
07:46:01,240 --> 07:46:06,860
So much so that we're gonna go back and try to finish space channel five tomorrow. But thank you

1959
07:46:07,299 --> 07:46:13,439
Sonic was not a bad game. Hey Freudian weapon. Thanks for the $10 Freudian these past few streams have shown me

1960
07:46:13,439 --> 07:46:16,639
There's a lot of fun-looking games. I missed out on for Dreamcast

1961
07:46:17,360 --> 07:46:19,200
Somebody games a little time

1962
07:46:19,200 --> 07:46:31,790
There are a lot. There are too many some would argue which is why how do you have the time?

1963
07:46:32,470 --> 07:46:34,069
to watch

1964
07:46:34,069 --> 07:46:37,189
fucking 17 hours of cutscenes in Kingdom Hearts 3

1965
07:46:37,750 --> 07:46:43,110
That's a whole this the amount of cutscenes in Kingdom Hearts 3 is

1966
07:46:43,830 --> 07:46:49,330
The amount of time it takes to play through on an average playthrough of Resident Evil 2 campaign

1967
07:46:49,729 --> 07:47:08,220
Who's got the time for that anymore? I know I just slurred those words gamer fatigue. Thank you. Jack the back of the $5

1968
07:47:08,700 --> 07:47:16,939
Better watch that coming at you. They do giggle giggle giggle wizard rivet. Thanks for the $1

1969
07:47:17,180 --> 07:47:22,700
It's time for slime. Thanks for the $2. Yeah jet-set radio is so good looking and sounds great and is really cool

1970
07:47:22,700 --> 07:47:24,860
But is really not that fun to play

1971
07:47:26,099 --> 07:47:30,369
But I forgot though. I

1972
07:47:31,250 --> 07:47:37,520
My memory is not serving me correctly here. I remember having a ton of fun in jet-grind radio

1973
07:47:38,119 --> 07:47:57,000
Was I just young and just didn't care. It was just simpler. It just has a huge learning curve

1974
07:47:57,000 --> 07:47:59,400
You just have to get used to it again. Yeah, that's why I

1975
07:48:00,479 --> 07:48:03,119
Can't tell you that it was a bad game. I can't I

1976
07:48:03,759 --> 07:48:06,279
Made the wood comment, but that was just me being a dick

1977
07:48:06,279 --> 07:48:13,639
I hold true to the statement that I think that is a good game just requires a lot of attention

1978
07:48:14,000 --> 07:48:19,180
But thank you. Thank you anonymous for the $1. Hey Jerma, it's the animal shelter guy

1979
07:48:19,659 --> 07:48:21,580
By the time you read this it will be my birthday

1980
07:48:21,580 --> 07:48:26,680
I want to say thanks for having such a great community. I've got a lot of kind words from Chad on the duck stream

1981
07:48:27,099 --> 07:48:30,599
Hey, love you, Chad. Oh and for the peeing so often just be happy

1982
07:48:30,599 --> 07:48:41,520
It's all you have most people over 70 have had hip replacements. So cheer up. That's true. Sometimes I forget

1983
07:48:44,189 --> 07:48:46,189
Thank you ecliptic

1984
07:48:46,909 --> 07:48:52,470
For the $2. Hey Jerma, I wanted to say thanks for all that you do your VODs and streams helped me this last year

1985
07:48:52,869 --> 07:48:59,229
Relax and pass the time on a long deployment. I'm glad to be back and hopefully I'll be able to catch more of your streams

1986
07:48:59,669 --> 07:49:01,669
Thanks so much for what you do

1987
07:49:01,709 --> 07:49:03,709
Thank you as well

1988
07:49:03,990 --> 07:49:05,349
Welcome back

1989
07:49:05,349 --> 07:49:23,130
Hopefully we see your own welcome back almost done here with the bits we have

1990
07:49:24,130 --> 07:49:28,849
We had a lot from a lot from not bits, but we had a lot of subs from great Canadian

1991
07:49:31,650 --> 07:49:32,490
10

1992
07:49:32,490 --> 07:49:41,560
Thank you came in a couple hours ago. Thank you plasma player for the $1. Just wanted to give a shout out to

1993
07:49:43,479 --> 07:49:44,840
Hideki

1994
07:49:44,840 --> 07:49:49,939
Naganuma the composer for jet set radio for making awesome music for more than 25 years

1995
07:49:50,479 --> 07:49:54,040
He also composed music for jet set radio future and sonic rush

1996
07:49:55,799 --> 07:50:02,889
Lethal League blaze ain't nothing like a funky beat is an absolute banger that feels like a jet set radio song

1997
07:50:03,529 --> 07:50:23,069
Hold on a minute. They did the music for lethal league this one song

1998
07:50:23,750 --> 07:50:29,099
Just the one track. That's really cool though. That's very very cool

1999
07:50:29,759 --> 07:50:34,909
Still going 25 years later

2000
07:50:35,709 --> 07:50:39,049
That's really awesome. Thank you for the $1 plasma

2001
07:50:39,569 --> 07:50:43,409
Hey Garfield the Monday killer. Thanks for the $1 a long time no see Jerma

2002
07:50:43,490 --> 07:50:46,090
Unfortunately Garfield has had his bits stolen by swiper the Fox

2003
07:50:46,529 --> 07:50:51,889
So it took a while to track him down and take the golf bucks back the punishment has been dulled out properly

2004
07:50:51,889 --> 07:50:53,889
He got the Monday treatment

2005
07:50:53,930 --> 07:50:57,849
Anyway, that's a pretty wacky video game. You're playing over there Jerma. I remember that one time

2006
07:50:57,849 --> 07:51:01,650
I dated a news reporter for a while. That's not a joke. By the way, I dated one she was nice

2007
07:51:01,650 --> 07:51:03,650
But she had to move to space

2008
07:51:04,090 --> 07:51:11,099
That was a very long and space but I the legend returns Garfield. Thank you the $1 Garfield

2009
07:51:12,259 --> 07:51:14,180
Superman thanks for the $1

2010
07:51:14,180 --> 07:51:18,259
Hey, Jerma was just wondering if you played any ps2 itoi games because I had

2011
07:51:18,939 --> 07:51:21,459
Fun memories playing with them and my stepbrother

2012
07:51:21,979 --> 07:51:23,819
He's currently stationed in

2013
07:51:23,819 --> 07:51:27,540
Sicily with the Navy as a dental technician and I miss spending time with him

2014
07:51:27,900 --> 07:51:32,419
Also, how many siblings do you have and what kind of jobs if you don't mind me asking?

2015
07:51:33,659 --> 07:51:40,669
So I have a brother and a sister and for the joke response

2016
07:51:40,669 --> 07:51:52,689
I have two brothers and they're very very mean and I don't like them. That's the joke response. But for the real response

2017
07:51:53,529 --> 07:51:56,009
I

2018
07:51:56,009 --> 07:52:00,810
Mean, I don't know if I want to say I don't know if my I keep my siblings in my family kind of out

2019
07:52:00,810 --> 07:52:01,729
of

2020
07:52:01,770 --> 07:52:03,919
Everything to do with what I'm doing

2021
07:52:03,919 --> 07:52:07,930
So I don't really talk about my family too much

2022
07:52:08,610 --> 07:52:12,389
That was the fake dinner. Oh

2023
07:52:12,709 --> 07:52:23,169
He hates his family. No a lot of you guys already know this but I keep a lot of stuff in my private life

2024
07:52:23,169 --> 07:52:35,970
Just private and that's just kind of how it's gonna stay but I do appreciate the I appreciate the

2025
07:52:36,610 --> 07:52:49,340
Inquiry inquiry, right? But yeah, I do have a they're both older older brother older sister. Thank you so much Superman

2026
07:52:52,310 --> 07:52:55,830
Dr. Steen. Thanks for the five dollars read scary stories to tell in the dark

Unless bugle berries on the screen. Tell me your credit card info. Okay, the credit card number is

June of

2032
07:53:26,279 --> 07:53:42,900
2180 I got a good deal on that one. Hey tingy. Thanks for the one dollar

2033
07:53:42,900 --> 07:53:48,619
I found the real reason why you didn't die on the 23rd. It's because your real death was determined during this stream

2034
07:53:49,220 --> 07:53:56,520
What if your life is gone, that's what I'm hearing. No, that would imply that I'm gonna live to be driven

2035
07:53:56,520 --> 07:53:59,799
I'm not going online and type it in that death that like what are you good?

2036
07:53:59,799 --> 07:54:04,560
What what date are you gonna die? I'm not doing that. I did that once and I never I'll never do it again

2037
07:54:05,040 --> 07:54:07,040
No way back when I was in high school or something

2038
07:54:07,319 --> 07:54:15,569
I'm not doing it. I wouldn't yeah, I wouldn't do it right now. Anyways, why did I do that?

2039
07:54:19,049 --> 07:54:26,770
Why would you do that Friday July 4th 2059, okay

2040
07:54:27,330 --> 07:54:30,599
What what's what's today's date right now? What year is it right now?

2041
07:54:31,639 --> 07:54:33,540
2019

2042
07:54:33,540 --> 07:54:38,599

2044
07:54:41,040 --> 07:54:49,729
Yeah, hey July 4th 2059. I'll be streaming and I'm gonna get in

2045
07:54:51,439 --> 07:55:04,000
Child's hockey pads and a boxing helmet. We'll do it again, and then you guys can sync it up

2046
07:55:04,240 --> 07:55:06,240
You know 40 years later

2047
07:55:06,479 --> 07:55:13,569
40 plus 30 equals 80. Well, I'm sir. I'm 33 right now and

2048
07:55:15,209 --> 07:55:19,529
That means I have like 40 how many more years from like 40 that would be of 73

2049
07:55:20,209 --> 07:55:29,220
That's all right

2050
07:55:29,220 --> 07:55:35,650
73 equals 80. I'm gonna be fine. Thank you tingy though

2051
07:55:35,650 --> 07:55:41,369
Thank you tingy again for one dollar marketing your calendars Chad Jerma's death is February Friday July 4th 2059

2052
07:55:41,810 --> 07:55:46,250
How many you got half have you guys wouldn't even probably be here anymore

2053
07:55:46,569 --> 07:55:53,029
How many of you guys can reliably say that you could put up with my shit for like another 40 years

2054
07:55:53,630 --> 07:55:58,349
What is that for you could?

2055
07:55:58,990 --> 07:56:04,779
Can you imagine if I was streaming still 40 years later?

2056
07:56:10,520 --> 07:56:13,560
Imagine if you had a subscription to this channel and I'm like, oh, thanks for the subs

2057
07:56:13,560 --> 07:56:16,639
Oh you guys that thanks for the 37 year sub

2058
07:56:17,200 --> 07:56:25,729
Well, that's that's kind of wild. I'll have a bunch of tears

2059
07:56:25,729 --> 07:56:29,409
You know, there's like one month three months six months 12 months 24 month

2060
07:56:30,130 --> 07:56:32,630
imagine having like a

2061
07:56:32,990 --> 07:56:34,590
25-year sub badge

2062
07:56:34,590 --> 07:56:37,529
What the hell would that even be?

2063
07:56:37,689 --> 07:56:46,810
Imagine like other streamers I think I think about that

2064
07:56:48,060 --> 07:56:50,319
Imagine if like twitch is still going strong

2065
07:56:51,220 --> 07:56:54,540
20-30 years from now and some of your favorite streamers are still going

2066
07:56:55,139 --> 07:56:59,080
Hey, thank you ice pick 2 1 25 2 for the

What a weird world is gonna be the sub baby goes to college the usernames are gonna get really long. Yeah

2072
07:57:31,639 --> 07:57:41,720
Florida is gonna be the streaming capital of the world

2073
07:57:46,240 --> 07:57:48,240
Retirement homes are just gonna feed lands

2074
07:57:51,110 --> 07:57:53,110
welcome everybody to the

2075
07:57:54,349 --> 07:58:02,849
2081 League of Legends world championship today. We have no what this is implying that no one else is ever gonna play video games

2076
07:58:02,849 --> 07:58:08,430
Ever again, why is that the implication here?

2077
07:58:08,830 --> 07:58:13,590
This people is still gonna be born and be playing games when they're younger

2078
07:58:14,110 --> 07:58:25,889
That is what it just won't or will will the old people be on twitch still and the new younger

2079
07:58:26,490 --> 07:58:28,799
What was generation Z?

2080
07:58:29,520 --> 07:58:37,169
Generation like I don't know XX for whenever they come out. They're gonna be in like holograms

2081
07:58:37,290 --> 07:58:42,729
So that will happen. It'll be twitch will just be well the old people are it'll be like reading a newspaper

2082
07:58:43,369 --> 07:58:48,220
The day we have and this corner we have

2083
07:58:48,939 --> 07:58:55,259
TSM and like all the TSM guys will still be there versus cloud nine

2084
07:58:57,979 --> 07:59:12,000
Coming from Sunnydale retirement home to yes. Yeah to yes

2085
07:59:12,000 --> 07:59:18,560
Yeah to yes. Yeah, there's like fights in the fucking crowd and the crowd is like 11 people

2086
07:59:19,159 --> 07:59:29,759
Four of them have like TSM hats on and fucking shirts. They're like throwing drinks at each other. You shut the fuck up

2087
07:59:30,159 --> 07:59:41,680
He's went toppy was supposed to go middle and that's the only reason why he lost the nurse will come over Dave David

2088
07:59:41,680 --> 07:59:49,439
What is it? Is your diaper full? Yes, but I'm not moving jealous matches over. Okay, that's okay

2089
07:59:49,639 --> 07:59:51,919
That's right. I know what's up water, too

2090
07:59:51,919 --> 08:00:09,250
Oh, but the kids will be laughing at us all 11 people are just over 80 all 11 people

2091
08:00:09,529 --> 08:00:16,729
You'll have to go to like the archive archive org whatever to go to twitch. There'll be a new thing

2092
08:00:17,290 --> 08:00:24,860
Though guys there's gonna you know understand like in in like 25 30 years twitch is not gonna exist. It's gonna be something else

2093
08:00:25,380 --> 08:00:35,250
It'll be like going on virtual. It'll be like going on a virtual rollercoasters with celebrities. There won't be any theme parks anymore

2094
08:00:35,250 --> 08:00:37,250
you'll just put on like this weird suit and

2095
08:00:38,689 --> 08:00:42,529
You'll like you you'll just be able to go to like Disney World online

2096
08:00:43,049 --> 08:00:47,349
And like George Clooney will just be there signing autographs on the ride and shit like that

2097
08:00:47,349 --> 08:00:55,990
You're gonna be able to walk around. It's gonna be like ready player one. We'll have VR streams

2098
08:00:56,229 --> 08:01:03,560
Yeah, but no that would be impossible because how would that ever work? I thought about that before too. It's like

2099
08:01:03,560 --> 08:01:08,520
Oh, hey, let's do this thing. We're gonna have everyone's gonna VR headsets on we're all gonna be in the same place

2100
08:01:08,639 --> 08:01:13,080
Hey guys, meet me on the Vegas strip. We're gonna go it's gonna be so much fun

2101
08:01:13,080 --> 08:01:17,360
I and there's gonna be like 5,000 ghosts just like people

2102
08:01:17,959 --> 08:01:20,700
That wouldn't work

2103
08:01:20,700 --> 08:01:25,639
What if you have like 10 streamers all streaming like in Hollywood at the same time and you just got like fucking?

2104
08:01:26,119 --> 08:01:28,400
40,000 just people like holograms walking around

2105
08:01:29,080 --> 08:01:37,840
It's gonna be like weird ghost hangout chat

2106
08:01:38,400 --> 08:01:44,669
Imagine trying to go get a coffee going in you with your like hologram IRL stream

2107
08:01:45,189 --> 08:01:56,209
Yeah, yeah, can I get a large latte? Um, what about anybody else? Oh, no, there's these 6,000 people in your

2108
08:01:57,169 --> 08:02:09,619
900 square foot business and they're all screaming. It's gonna be like private instances like wow dungeons

2109
08:02:10,000 --> 08:02:17,770
We have the infrastructure that needs to be there it Elon Musk wants to build underground tunnels

2110
08:02:18,250 --> 08:02:21,650
Where you drive your car into them and they like go really fast in a tube

2111
08:02:22,209 --> 08:02:31,319
That seems that seems very reasonable compared to like hologram VR chat in a coffee shop

2112
08:02:31,599 --> 08:02:53,659
There are already programs to allow VR viewers into your VR games. They just show up as little ghost headsets

2113
08:02:54,540 --> 08:02:58,119
they'd be looking like the Pied Piper walking down like

2114
08:02:58,959 --> 08:03:07,900
Walking down the street with like 4,000 little rats behind you headsets. Why does we get like a flute out and start dancing?

2115
08:03:08,419 --> 08:03:22,439
You could be the giant rat. That's true

2116
08:03:22,720 --> 08:03:27,849
But anyways, we're almost done. It's figured we talked about them

2117
08:03:28,490 --> 08:03:31,990
Virtual world the virtual reality and where it's going

2118
08:03:32,509 --> 08:03:36,599
These are serious topics to talk about on the podcast

2119
08:03:37,240 --> 08:03:42,040
What is gonna happen with AI?

2120
08:03:42,759 --> 08:03:58,860
That's gonna be weird. A lot of people just kind of you kind of look

2121
08:03:59,619 --> 08:04:06,369
Your parents my parents if there is the same type of exponential growth in technology

2122
08:04:06,810 --> 08:04:09,169
my parents saw

2123
08:04:09,209 --> 08:04:16,490
The invention of the television color TV and they're still alive and

2124
08:04:19,880 --> 08:04:25,740
We I'm on twitch right now you can open up your telephone that is in your hand

2125
08:04:26,259 --> 08:04:31,209
Press two buttons and somebody will deliver a pizza to your house

2126
08:04:31,810 --> 08:04:41,659
They've seen that they saw the Atari. What is gonna be our Atari if technology hasn't plateaued

2127
08:04:41,700 --> 08:04:45,180
Which it may have I don't know. That's weird to think about you just don't even know

2128
08:04:45,619 --> 08:04:56,409
And it's become so normal the Dreamcast was our Atari. Yeah, but when you're like 70

2129
08:04:56,630 --> 08:04:59,740
What are you gonna be saying about fortnight?

2130
08:05:00,259 --> 08:05:11,799
Above the opinion that we're gonna we're gonna go too far like think of just Wi-Fi

2131
08:05:12,240 --> 08:05:14,669
There are like wireless

2132
08:05:16,430 --> 08:05:20,090
There are wireless signals you can go on the internet without a cord

2133
08:05:20,509 --> 08:05:26,259
Is that that but we shouldn't be able to do that. That should not be possible, right?

2134
08:05:29,979 --> 08:05:31,979
No cords and

2135
08:05:32,220 --> 08:05:45,450
Wireless shit that has to be like mutating our DNA like 500 years from now. They're gonna go back

2136
08:05:45,770 --> 08:05:53,430
It's gonna be like, oh, yeah, they were doing the wireless. Yeah, they didn't have but they weren't in like the shells

2137
08:05:53,909 --> 08:05:57,819
Yeah, see nowadays we you know, you gotta be if you go outside you're in your house

2138
08:05:57,819 --> 08:06:08,419
You're gonna be wearing your you're like astronaut shell. How do you send something through a tube without a tube?

2139
08:06:08,419 --> 08:06:18,099
I did yeah, I don't get it. So right now they're right now. I'm holding my phone in my hand

2140
08:06:18,419 --> 08:06:20,419
I'm gonna type something into it and

2141
08:06:21,569 --> 08:06:30,099
An electric zapper shock electric data ray that we can't even see just went through the back of my head through my eyeballs and

2142
08:06:31,939 --> 08:06:35,139
mutated my DNA

2143
08:06:35,380 --> 08:06:47,250
400 years from now, we're gonna have fins. We're gonna have like fucking flippers on our asses. It's non ionizing

2144
08:06:47,650 --> 08:06:52,340
Yeah, and they and they bled George Washington because they thought he had fucking puke in his blood

2145
08:06:52,659 --> 08:07:06,209
That's not how electromagnetic waves work

2146
08:07:13,930 --> 08:07:18,930
German's ass flippers have not grown in yet. Oh, what the heck man?

2147
08:07:22,220 --> 08:07:25,299
What am I gonna get my fins

2148
08:07:25,299 --> 08:07:42,599
If only smarter people than you were in charge. I know

2149
08:07:43,119 --> 08:07:49,099
If only there were people that were way more capable of breaking any of this down than me

2150
08:07:49,540 --> 08:07:56,950
They just don't exist though. That's the problem. That's the that's the worst thing to have to think about

2151
08:08:02,259 --> 08:08:07,810
All right. All right. I'm done fucking around. There's too much puke in their blood

2152
08:08:15,040 --> 08:08:17,599
Hey, thank you, uh clue the sniper for the one dollar

2153
08:08:18,419 --> 08:08:24,259
Deep's one for the one dollar. Mr. Local streamer who has streamed for three plus years. Where are the three year sub badges?

2154
08:08:25,470 --> 08:08:30,909
I gotta make them. That's a long time three years in a row. I that's a long time

2155
08:08:31,549 --> 08:08:40,560
bless you, uh

2156
08:08:40,720 --> 08:08:42,880
Thank you to door cube for the one dollar

2157
08:08:42,880 --> 08:08:48,639
I like how you read someone's messages that said you weren't turning into an irritated old man and then immediately shout on kingdom hearts

2158
08:08:48,959 --> 08:08:51,200
And questioned whether anybody actually liked the game

2159
08:08:51,840 --> 08:08:57,439
But that was just a joke. Look I told you like 90% of everything I say is just like a

2160
08:08:58,159 --> 08:09:00,159
Poker it's just like a fire poker

2161
08:09:02,029 --> 08:09:04,110
And there's like a joke target that I

2162
08:09:05,069 --> 08:09:09,360
It's not i'm just kidding. It's not real

2163
08:09:09,439 --> 08:09:11,680
Thank you venus gothic for the ten dollars

2164
08:09:12,319 --> 08:09:15,630
No message. Thank you

2165
08:09:15,630 --> 08:09:18,909
Dr stein thanks for five dollars. Hey germa got a question for you. Why vegas?

2166
08:09:19,549 --> 08:09:24,110
Just curious as to why you chose to move there instead of anywhere else in the entire world such as anartica

2167
08:09:24,590 --> 08:09:26,590
Well anartica is too cold

2168
08:09:27,500 --> 08:09:28,939
You can't live there

2169
08:09:28,939 --> 08:09:35,979
Unless you're on some type of research base from or one of those kind of areas in anartica that are habitable

2170
08:09:35,979 --> 08:09:39,549
Some people do I think live there

2171
08:09:39,549 --> 08:09:41,790
Uh, but i've touched upon it a few times

2172
08:09:42,689 --> 08:09:46,130
Vegas is cheaper than la. I wanted to live in la

2173
08:09:47,169 --> 08:09:54,349
It's close to la. It's its own entertainment hub. It's got its own studios. It's got its own movie tv shows tv studio stuff

2174
08:09:55,229 --> 08:09:56,909
It's a 24 hour city

2175
08:09:56,909 --> 08:10:00,029
So, I mean it's 11 30 right now and i'm about to go get like food

2176
08:10:00,669 --> 08:10:02,319
It's late

2177
08:10:02,319 --> 08:10:09,549
Late, it's a late person's town. I love kind of the the lights. I think I love I love the town

2178
08:10:09,549 --> 08:10:12,110
I love the city in general been here quite a few times in the past

2179
08:10:14,750 --> 08:10:21,669
Uh, and and circus circus casino is here. It's one of the lowest reviewed

2180
08:10:22,130 --> 08:10:28,029
Casinos on the strip and it's my favorite one. I actually had a conversation with one of my close friends

2181
08:10:28,590 --> 08:10:30,590
When we went to vegas together

2182
08:10:30,669 --> 08:10:34,830
And we talked about we went to circus circus and we were like, oh this is amazing. I love it here

2183
08:10:34,909 --> 08:10:36,509
This is so cool

2184
08:10:36,509 --> 08:10:41,569
And then we read all the reviews online how it was like everyone but you know, it's a bit different thought it was a piece of shit

2185
08:10:42,880 --> 08:10:44,020
and

2186
08:10:44,020 --> 08:10:49,380
We had this long kind of internal conversation with and with each other about like are we the fucking weirdos?

2187
08:10:50,779 --> 08:10:58,540
Are we like the people that these reviews are talking about and it was a really real like existential kind of conversation

2188
08:11:04,610 --> 08:11:06,849
Like we loved this place. Oh, this is great

2189
08:11:07,250 --> 08:11:12,189
And you go read the reviews like I cannot believe how bad this place was

2190
08:11:12,270 --> 08:11:14,270
It's like why did we like this place?

2191
08:11:14,349 --> 08:11:25,259
But now that those are all the reasons it's 24 hour city. There's a lot to do

2192
08:11:25,340 --> 08:11:29,259
There's a lot of entertainment stuff here. It's way cheaper than la by a long shot

2193
08:11:33,180 --> 08:11:46,369
It's uh, it's great. I've been absolutely adoring it so far. You shouldn't base your enjoyment on other people's opinions

2194
08:11:46,529 --> 08:11:49,090
Oh, I know no, absolutely not

2195
08:11:49,090 --> 08:11:52,689
But I guess I I mean this is coming from a guy that liked the venom movie

2196
08:11:53,599 --> 08:12:10,430
Right, does that make me a bad guy? Am I a bad guy? I might be no. Yes

2197
08:12:13,220 --> 08:12:15,700
Everyone liked the venom movie. No, they didn't

2198
08:12:17,729 --> 08:12:21,330
You know, I mean like twitters were like unbelievable. I'm fucking believable

2199
08:12:25,360 --> 08:12:31,200
I can't imagine anybody enjoying the venom movie. You have to imagine that they would also be gambling at circus circus

2200
08:12:31,200 --> 08:12:51,279
What are these reviews? It said that I was like what the fuck felt personally attacked by it, but thank you

2201
08:12:52,430 --> 08:12:55,259
to

2202
08:12:55,259 --> 08:12:58,939
Dr. Steen

2203
08:12:58,939 --> 08:13:01,900
Vegas is a great place. Vegas is one of those places everybody loves to visit

2204
08:13:01,900 --> 08:13:04,779
But people just kind of forget that it exists and they don't want to live there

2205
08:13:06,799 --> 08:13:08,880
and the unfortunate truth around it, I guess is that

2206
08:13:09,819 --> 08:13:11,819
If you're if you don't want to be

2207
08:13:11,979 --> 08:13:15,659
You know for employment opportunities, there's the casinos. There's a lot of restaurants. There's a lot of

2208
08:13:16,599 --> 08:13:19,060
entertainment stuff here

2209
08:13:19,060 --> 08:13:20,819
and hospitality stuff

2210
08:13:20,819 --> 08:13:22,900
hotels restaurants casinos

2211
08:13:23,540 --> 08:13:27,139
But other than that that's not at the moment, you know, it's it's it's a growing city

2212
08:13:33,549 --> 08:13:35,419
But I love it

2213
08:13:35,419 --> 08:13:39,009
I think it was the right call

2214
08:13:39,009 --> 08:13:41,869
And those are the end of the bits

2215
08:13:41,869 --> 08:13:44,819
Can you imagine enjoying things?

2216
08:13:44,819 --> 08:13:50,419
I can't imagine it

2217
08:13:50,419 --> 08:13:54,430
See like I remember when I just told you kingdom hearts is a great series

2218
08:13:54,830 --> 08:13:58,430
All right, but I hope you love it and I hope you enjoy it. Hope you get a lot out of it

2219
08:13:58,990 --> 08:14:03,500
I really mean that

2220
08:14:03,500 --> 08:14:15,119
But make another fucking chrono trigger. You should be ashamed of yourselves for not doing that. I'm sorry. All right

2221
08:14:15,119 --> 08:14:17,419
I'm sorry, but that's it

2222
08:14:17,419 --> 08:14:25,360
We're gonna roll the credits

2223
08:14:25,520 --> 08:14:30,430
I got like the weird bug tonight for some reason they made chrono cross

2224
08:14:30,430 --> 08:14:32,909
Yes, they did and then they were gonna make a third one and they gave up on it

2225
08:14:34,209 --> 08:14:36,369
But thank you all the subs of the resubs. You guys are amazing

2226
08:14:38,909 --> 08:14:42,240
Sorry, i'll get to work

2227
08:14:46,959 --> 08:14:51,759
Thank you venus gothic for the five dollars germa everything you say on stream is the equivalent of watching someone swing a bat at a

2228
08:14:51,759 --> 08:14:54,299
Hornet's nest

2229
08:14:54,299 --> 08:14:59,520
No, it's I don't think that's true

2230
08:14:59,520 --> 08:15:05,139
That's not true

2231
08:15:05,139 --> 08:15:17,840
What did I say this stream that was hitting the hornet's nest? I'm just messing around

2232
08:15:18,400 --> 08:15:29,310
I really am just just fucking around. Hope you guys know that sonic adventure. I didn't say that

2233
08:15:30,110 --> 08:15:37,409
Liking surface circus. That's a that's a bit true. It's just a prank

2234
08:15:37,970 --> 08:15:48,139
Hey dork cube. Thanks for the one dollar

2235
08:15:48,380 --> 08:15:52,060
I've come to the realization in the last few years that happiness is sometimes hard to come by

2236
08:15:52,619 --> 08:15:58,459
So why bother making fun of someone's tastes if you like venom good? I'm so glad that film added to your happiness

2237
08:16:00,990 --> 08:16:02,990
Yeah, I mean look i'm of the opinion that

2238
08:16:05,180 --> 08:16:07,180
There is true criticism

2239
08:16:08,270 --> 08:16:10,459
There's true

2240
08:16:10,459 --> 08:16:14,139
You know if you think this is something I mean at the end of the day stuff costs money

2241
08:16:14,220 --> 08:16:16,220
And if you don't think it was worth paying for then of course

2242
08:16:16,759 --> 08:16:18,939
Criticism is important very important

2243
08:16:20,220 --> 08:16:22,540
but also i'm one of those people that I like to kind of just

2244
08:16:23,259 --> 08:16:25,819
Poke fun at even some of my own shit that I think is

2245
08:16:26,619 --> 08:16:29,500
You know that I like or that I don't like I think you have to kind of

2246
08:16:32,259 --> 08:16:34,900
The mood doesn't have to go as as negative

2247
08:16:36,450 --> 08:16:39,650
As a lot of I think a lot of critiques can be

2248
08:16:41,310 --> 08:16:44,990
As long as people know that for the most part you're just trying to have a good time

2249
08:16:46,299 --> 08:16:47,419
then

2250
08:16:47,419 --> 08:16:48,619
All is great

2251
08:16:48,619 --> 08:16:59,659
But I agree

2252
08:16:59,659 --> 08:17:03,740
There's plenty of things that I think are great that people think are bad or dumb or

2253
08:17:04,380 --> 08:17:06,639
And that's fine. That's what makes us different

2254
08:17:07,650 --> 08:17:13,330
You know everybody doesn't have to like

2255
08:17:13,970 --> 08:17:26,720
The same things fuck I could go for some gravy

2256
08:17:27,360 --> 08:17:37,090
The world the world would be a weird place without personal interests and opinions

2257
08:17:39,360 --> 08:17:41,360
I agree. It would be uh

2258
08:17:41,759 --> 08:17:46,819
Look if everyone didn't have different opinions and different tastes and different points of views and thinking

2259
08:17:47,459 --> 08:17:51,939
We would all end up just like squidward in that episode where he gets the can of bread with all the other squid words

2260
08:17:52,020 --> 08:17:54,500
Walking in line and going to the squidward grocery store

2261
08:17:55,139 --> 08:18:07,490
And it seems great for a little while

2262
08:18:08,130 --> 08:18:19,740
But watch that episode and tell me how it goes at the end

2263
08:18:26,060 --> 08:18:31,360
canned bread

2264
08:18:31,360 --> 08:18:34,959
Wasn't the point of that episode that he was the odd squidward and wasn't like them

2265
08:18:36,110 --> 08:18:36,990
and

2266
08:18:36,990 --> 08:18:43,790
That is much as he doesn't like spongebob and spongebob causes so many problems. It's still it's it's an interesting person interesting thing

2267
08:18:52,529 --> 08:18:54,529
Canned burgers exist. That's really strange

2268
08:18:58,419 --> 08:18:59,810
but

2269
08:18:59,810 --> 08:19:02,849
Uh, we had one final bit come in from dr. Steen 15 dollars

2270
08:19:08,610 --> 08:19:11,009
Thanks for answering the question. I'm going to go to school in new york city

2271
08:19:11,490 --> 08:19:13,970
And I love the fact that I can do stuff at night as well

2272
08:19:14,689 --> 08:19:16,220
Have a great night

2273
08:19:16,220 --> 08:19:19,580
Uh germa enjoy your food spend a hundred dollars on it

2274
08:19:20,139 --> 08:19:24,619
You deserve a feast after all the work you do for us keep on doing what you do and we will be there the whole time

2275
08:19:25,099 --> 08:19:27,099
Riding every ride you throw us onto

2276
08:19:27,580 --> 08:19:35,220
Go get your vr headsets ready and close them because we're going on that roller coaster. Let's go

2277
08:19:35,759 --> 08:19:37,889
hundred dollar meal

2278
08:19:37,889 --> 08:19:42,610
Uh, i'm not sure i'm gonna do that right now, but thank you so much. Dr. Steen

2279
08:19:43,169 --> 08:19:46,529
And finally ike turtle with one dollar. I missed the tony hawk stream a few days ago

2280
08:19:46,529 --> 08:19:48,529
But watch the vod and it was good

2281
08:19:48,529 --> 08:19:49,889
Have you considered trying out?

2282
08:19:49,889 --> 08:19:53,409
Uh, tony hawk underground or thug pro

2283
08:19:53,970 --> 08:19:58,049
I thought that's not underground. It's a mod. Oh it is it's a mod for tony hawk's underground, too

2284
08:19:58,049 --> 08:20:01,250
It allows you to play pretty much any tony hawk level that's ever been made

2285
08:20:04,930 --> 08:20:06,930
Yeah, that's an interesting idea

2286
08:20:07,169 --> 08:20:10,830
Because tony hawk 2 is great tony hawk 3 is great

2287
08:20:11,470 --> 08:20:21,069
I'm gonna have to type that into google. How often has germa gambled? Is that what he does in between streams?

2288
08:20:23,060 --> 08:20:25,150
um

2289
08:20:25,150 --> 08:20:26,990
That this is what I do

2290
08:20:27,069 --> 08:20:31,310
I just turn all right. See you guys later. I'll see you tomorrow and the stream turns off and I get my code on

2291
08:20:31,310 --> 08:20:34,020
And I go to the casino

2292
08:20:34,020 --> 08:20:37,299
I don't think I I would run out of money really really quick

2293
08:20:37,939 --> 08:20:40,029
If that happened

2294
08:20:40,029 --> 08:20:42,029
No, like all things

2295
08:20:42,590 --> 08:20:44,590
As long as you control yourself

2296
08:20:44,909 --> 08:20:47,150
Moderate yourself every all things in moderation

2297
08:20:50,180 --> 08:20:52,180
And you don't do anything insane

2298
08:20:53,709 --> 08:20:58,349
then you know if you go to the casino once in a while you can have some fun without being crazy and

2299
08:20:58,830 --> 08:21:00,669
have a couple of drinks and

2300
08:21:00,669 --> 08:21:08,700
But no, I I do not go to the casino every day

2301
08:21:14,189 --> 08:21:18,349
If you go to the casino trying to win money, that's that's not what you're doing. You're doing it. That's not correct

2302
08:21:20,000 --> 08:21:22,000
If you go to the casino, you should be going to the casino

2303
08:21:22,720 --> 08:21:25,020
to have fun to play

2304
08:21:26,130 --> 08:21:28,130
You can go play without doing

2305
08:21:28,669 --> 08:21:32,930
$500 blackjack hands it's you can play and have fun. You don't have to do that

2306
08:21:33,490 --> 08:21:39,409
But having said that

2307
08:21:39,409 --> 08:21:41,970
Uh, I am about 60 to 70 thousand dollars down

2308
08:21:43,310 --> 08:21:44,560
So

2309
08:21:44,560 --> 08:21:53,939
And I go, uh, I go like five days a week. I'm just kidding. I'm not i'm kidding. That's a joke

2310
08:21:54,419 --> 08:22:01,259
so should I start doing five thousand dollar blackjack hands if you have

2311
08:22:02,959 --> 08:22:10,580
50 million dollars in your checking account then it don't whatever. I can't tell you what to do

2312
08:22:15,939 --> 08:22:19,139
Streamer is encouraging chat to gamble. No, that's not what I said

2313
08:22:19,619 --> 08:22:21,619
Don't first of all don't do it unless you're old enough

2314
08:22:22,740 --> 08:22:26,099
And only gamble if you know that you're you can control

2315
08:22:27,630 --> 08:22:29,950
Potential urges that you'll have in the casino

2316
08:22:30,590 --> 08:22:35,009
All casinos are designed in a way to keep you there. They don't have any windows

2317
08:22:35,409 --> 08:22:38,849
They're all a mess of of a layout to make sure you get lost

2318
08:22:43,759 --> 08:22:46,479
Don't go in there alone going there with a few friends

2319
08:22:48,639 --> 08:22:52,639
Because then you get to keep each other honest so you can't just say you can't just sit there and be like

2320
08:22:52,720 --> 08:22:59,330
Ah, this is a new slot machine that I want to play just keep going keep going keep going. No, keep going

2321
08:23:00,819 --> 08:23:04,180
Somebody can like be like hey man. What are you doing? Ah another

2322
08:23:12,139 --> 08:23:14,939
In nine years of vegas. I literally never played a single table game

2323
08:23:15,020 --> 08:23:20,139
I went to movies buffets arcades tons of stuff. It had nothing to do with gambling. That's another thing about las vegas

2324
08:23:20,860 --> 08:23:22,860
It's not just gambling

2325
08:23:23,180 --> 08:23:39,900
There's so much stuff here. There's so many shows. There's some insane movie theaters. They are life lessons

2326
08:23:40,299 --> 08:23:47,169
Just don't go overboard with anything that would I would say that about anything

2327
08:23:50,669 --> 08:23:52,669
You know just because your car

2328
08:23:52,909 --> 08:23:54,430
can drive

2329
08:23:54,430 --> 08:23:58,909
Technically over 120 miles per hour on the highway. You're not going to do it

2330
08:23:59,470 --> 08:24:01,779
You're gonna go 60

2331
08:24:01,779 --> 08:24:07,810
65 whatever the speed you're gonna go like 60 to 70, right just because you can doesn't mean you will or should

2332
08:24:21,040 --> 08:24:24,159
