1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:23,260
Asperdergo, no, that's not my name. My name is Captain Blackbeard. I can't fix it. I can't- what? I can't be Captain Blackbeard, I can be Captain Blackbear. That's not happening.

2
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:32,700
I've decided to change my name, ladies and gentlemen. For reasons unbeknownst to anybody, I'm now going to be Captain Humphreys.

3
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:49,159
His teeth are so white. That's not a pirate. Pirates don't have bright white crest commercial teeth. No, seriously, this guy's teeth are like perfect.

4
00:00:49,159 --> 00:01:00,920
What about this guy's teeth? They're great. This is fucking up my immersion.

5
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,920
Okay. Are you ready for the pirate to attack with his dual blades?

6
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,099
Yeah, I mean, I guess I could attack you with these. Yeah, whatever. I don't know. I just kinda don't care.

7
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:15,099
Did I get you? Did I get you? I'll just keep walking.

8
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:24,109
See, these are like the redcoats. It's the British. The British are coming. Tell Paul Revere.

9
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:30,569
You British need to leave our lands at once.

10
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:35,219
What? He doesn't know I'm right here?

11
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:42,129
What are they doing to that poor guy? That guy's gonna get... What is happening right now?

12
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:50,069
Is that a chicken? What are these chickens? Dude, look at these giant chickens. Oh, that's a turtle.

13
00:01:50,069 --> 00:02:01,500
I thought it was like a turkey. I thought it was a turkey. Hi, I'm Mr. Assassin Creed Man.

14
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,500
That's a nice big gun you got there.

15
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,229
Dude, that was sick.

16
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:18,990
Y'all know how it goes. I've been captain of this boat for long enough.

17
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:23,990
It's time to sing the pirate song that we've been learning since we were two years old.

18
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,990
And it starts a little something like this.

19
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,990
The wind at our backs and the sun at the sea. None have ever been good to me.

20
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,990
Feel the waves crush through the sky. Into the deep air, yonder sky.

21
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,990
Drink in my hand and a trickle of my sleeves.

22
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,990
Looting and prendering's all that I crave.

23
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,990
Cast on the sails, release the brave. Tonight we dive.

24
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,990
Oh, shit.

25
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,990
Oh, shit.

26
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,550
Anybody on this boat have insurance?

27
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,550
What's insurance?

28
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,550
Drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, go, go.

29
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,240
You're just a daydreaming office worker. That's like what this is.

30
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:03,550
Assassin's Creed IV is your daydreaming office worker.

31
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:10,240
Yeah, I may wear work socks, you know, but you know, I'm just gonna sit here at my cubicle, which is a cubicle.

32
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,240
I daydream about being a pirate and they like record my daydreams.

33
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:21,530
Got ourselves a fight here. Got ourselves a fight with the George Washingtons.

34
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:27,530
If you guys didn't know, the plot of this game of Assassin's Creed IV is George Washington cloned himself after the cherry tree incident.

35
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:33,530
And now he wants to try to take over the earth with his George Washington clones, but I ain't gonna let that happen.

36
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,770
Yeah, get the fuck out of here.

37
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,770
What about your buddy? Your buddy's a fucking gonna get his neck broken too.

38
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,770
What about this guy? Fuck you.

39
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,770
You're all gonna get your heads punched in.

40
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,770
You're gonna get your head busted, broken, your fucking neck.

41
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,770
Yo, get the ear clapped. What is this? Oh, you want to get a double tap?

42
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,770
What about you? Oh, what's this? Ooh, ooh.

43
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,770
What's that? Chin punch, bitch.

44
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,870
What you working on? Ah, sanding.

45
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:06,050
I used to sand. It was a really tough job. Really good, honest day's work.

46
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:12,979
Fuck yourself.

47
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:16,610
Be careful. This is a pretty big, this is this ledge.

48
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:21,610
I know you just want to dance. That's great. But you know, that's not a safe place to be.

49
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,610
I told you, now you're all wet.

50
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,779
And that wasn't my fault, that was your fault.

51
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:29,779
And now everyone's going for a swim. Let's go.

52
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:31,779
Everyone's going for a swim. Get in.

53
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:34,860
Did they actually follow you in?

54
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,439
This one died.

55
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:41,259
Oh, I gotta kill somebody.

56
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:46,120
I almost just shit my pants when I did that, by the way.

57
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,810
I seriously almost just shit my pants when I just sneezed.

58
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,649
Did you hear? You know he shit his pants last night?

59
00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:54,649
He sneezed.

60
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:55,649
That's gross.

61
00:04:55,649 --> 00:04:58,649
Take a look for yourself, man. Right here, five minutes, 45 seconds.

62
00:04:58,649 --> 00:05:00,649
Bang, shits his pants right there. How do you pull that off?

63
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:05,649
I don't know, but it's disgusting. He seriously disgusts me on another level that I can't even explain.

64
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:09,649
I mean, I shit my pants at least once a week, but I've never played in Assassin's Creed.

65
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:13,490
So I got MLC Stealth in the call here now.

66
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:18,490
We're going to go over some tips and some secret strategies that he knows about the Assassin's Creed multiplayer.

67
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,490
Because I know nothing. All I know is that I'm the Joker.

68
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,660
I'm playing as the Joker right now, and I need some secret tips from MLC Stealth.

69
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,860
Which does the Joker look like? Does he have a nose on his face?

70
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:35,550
No, the Joker. We're all the Joker. Every single person on our team is the Joker.

71
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:42,379
You can tell who a player is if they're jumping on roofs. That's normally what they do.

72
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:44,379
If they're moving quickly, it's a player.

73
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:47,379
You've got to sit there and hope they don't find you.

74
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:48,379
There's a guy.

75
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:49,379
You can't move. You can't budge.

76
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:53,129
I don't know what this guy's doing. Is that a bad guy?

77
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:54,129
No! Jesus!

78
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:56,129
He just has to remain still.

79
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:57,430
How did he...?

80
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,819
Hiding in a bush.

81
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:01,819
That's the way you do it. You hide in the bush.

82
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,819
Okay. Do I arrest this guy? Do I jump out and attack this guy?

83
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:05,819
Stealth, what do I do?

84
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:08,819
He's coming over here. No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh my God.

85
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:10,819
I think I killed him.

86
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:11,819
You have stunned him. No, I ripped him out.

87
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:13,819
Stealth, how do I...? Do I arrest him? Do I kill him?

88
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:16,819
I'm like killing civilians right now. Stealth, what do I do?

89
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:17,819
Stealth!

90
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:20,509
Am I still on the Skype call?

91
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:29,019
Killed my brother!

92
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:32,579
We got a huge amount of waves coming.

93
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:34,579
Brace yourselves, crew!

94
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:39,899
Oh, we're going to crash directly into these people.

95
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:43,459
The boat's going to tip over.

96
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:45,699
Holy crap.

97
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:51,699
This one fateful day reminds me of a story.

98
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:58,560
Did I ever tell you the story about me old boys?
