1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:10,029
I got here as soon as I could. I saw the time ticking down. I was like, wait a minute, 3 to 4 p.m. I gotta go.

2
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:25,789
I did the sprint where both your hands, you know, you do the one hand up, flat, right hand up, flat, over and over again, just straight up, like an old lady on the sidewalk.

3
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:30,920
That's what I did. Alright, let me tweet it. Give me one second.

4
00:00:30,920 --> 00:01:42,390
Alrighty, so today, my wonderful, wonderful, wonderful audience of mine, we got a bunch of PlayStation 2 stuff to do.

5
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:49,819
Remember I mentioned a few weeks ago that there was still a ton of stuff that I didn't do, I didn't cover?

6
00:01:49,819 --> 00:02:01,849
Well, it's here. And I don't know the exact process we're gonna do here, because some of these are probably really good.

7
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:09,659
And I might have to throw away my 45 minute and then bust the way that I do things.

8
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:26,539
So, we'll have to figure that out. Yes, I'm realizing how not good that just sounded. That's okay.

9
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:32,639
I'm gonna have to change the way that I do things, maybe, because for instance, some of these are really highly requested.

10
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:40,949
I got Psy Ops, the Mind Gate Conspiracy, that's one of the most highly requested PlayStation 2 games from people in this community.

11
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:47,389
And I don't know if I want to give that one like 30 minutes.

12
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:59,710
Also, I got another Family Feud. This might even be the same game, just on PS2. No, I don't think it is.

13
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:13,469
That got a bunch. So, I'm gonna go a few days in a row here, and we'll try to go through them.

14
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:25,599
After this weekend here, I'm gonna go back to some newer games that have come out recently.

15
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,599
So, what we're talking about, well, you did a bunch of VR shit. Here's the PlayStation 2, here's the Dreamcast.

16
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:39,189
We're gonna go back to some newer releases after this weekend, but I did want to get a lot of this out of the way.

17
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:47,680
And Vive comes back too. I got too much stuff to do. Why can't humans just be awake for 48 hours?

18
00:03:47,680 --> 00:04:00,409
I wish we had a 48-hour day. If humans could sleep for like 4 hours, be fully rested, you can try.

19
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:13,360
Alright, so, I mean, the one we're gonna start with here is one that is closest to my heart, I think.

20
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:20,170
The one that it just sears into my body. It's one of my favorite things I've ever seen in my life.

21
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:25,170
And of course, I'm talking about, hold on, I'm gonna make sure there's no naked person on the camera.

22
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:33,610
No, I'm talking about, well, the whole bit kind of got ruined, but what I'm talking about here is Ed Edd n Eddy,

23
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,610
The Misadventures of Ed Edd n Eddy. There it is.

24
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:55,209
Could have gone smoother with the reveal there. What's up with your hair? What do you mean?

25
00:04:55,389 --> 00:05:11,410
What's wrong with it? What's wrong with my hair? Because I was in the shower.

26
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:22,600
I'm in Vegas! It's hot here! Why are you in a tank top? I'm in Las Vegas! It's fucking like 150 degrees here every day!

27
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:33,480
You look like a shitty backup actor for an MTV video. That's your opinion, okay?

28
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,480
And you're allowed to have a wrong one, but that is yours.

29
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:44,279
Let's get it started. Ed Edd n Eddy, The Misadventures. The Mis-Edventures.

30
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:47,279
I'm gonna piss a lot of people off, I think, with this one.

31
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:55,259
Because I'm gonna play this. Here's what's gonna happen. We'll break it down. Hold on, let me just get my controller.

32
00:05:55,259 --> 00:06:03,060
I'm gonna play this for 15 minutes, and I'm gonna be like, okay, so walk over here, grab this box.

33
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:10,379
Okay, cool. That's funny. What do I do now? Nothing like really interesting is happening.

34
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:14,379
How do I? I'm streaming, I'm streaming. What do I say?

35
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:17,379
I'm gonna grab this thing. Oh, I grabbed Edd by the shoulder and I threw him.

36
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:20,379
Nothing's funny, nothing interesting is happening. What do I do about this?

37
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:30,370
That's gonna be going on internally in my head.

38
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,370
And then I'm gonna turn it off in like 30 minutes. Go, yeah, it's pretty cool.

39
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:41,089
I mean, I remember it was like fun. If you liked it, like, that's cool.

40
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:50,600
Can I even hear anything? Yeah, yeah.

41
00:06:50,600 --> 00:07:04,040
Before we start PlayStation 2 night, can we get some yes?

42
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,670
Checking memory card. Edd n Eddy, The Misadventures.

43
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:18,990
He's an autosave feature. Cartoon Network. Interactive. Midway. Really?

44
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:24,550
I didn't know they made this. Think Video.

45
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:29,860
They patented like one screen 40 years ago.

46
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:43,850
And now they're in every single video game. A to M.

47
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:49,610
Oh, I'm not gonna criticize this game.

48
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,980
You don't think I'm aware of the backlash I would receive?

49
00:07:53,980 --> 00:08:13,709
I'm not gonna move yet. Holy shit, this brings back memories.

50
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:15,709
Yeah, that's why I don't wanna make fun of it.

51
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:18,019
Not that I was going to.

52
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:20,019
This needs to be moved though.

53
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:22,829
Is the color correct? It looks weird.

54
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:29,550
Where's Ed? What happened to Ed?

55
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,710
How come he didn't say his name?

56
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:37,929
Wait, hold on a minute. Turn it up.

57
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:41,129
Listen. Does he say his name?

58
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:43,129
I heard Ed. Eddy!

59
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:49,019
Oh god, fuck. Whatever.

60
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:53,860
Why is turbo on? Why is turbo on?

61
00:08:53,860 --> 00:09:00,070
I don't want turbo.

62
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:04,870
Okay, new game.

63
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:09,539
There's no save file. Make one.

64
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:13,539
If somebody wants to make, like, a video, I'm just gonna give you an idea for a video.

65
00:09:13,539 --> 00:09:15,539
Whoever wants to make it, go for it.

66
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,720
This is not my idea.

67
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,720
This is an idea of somebody that would think this is a good idea.

68
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,600
It's not my idea.

69
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Wait, what? Eddy's game? Ed's game?

70
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,840
Doesn't matter?

71
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,840
Let's do Eddy.

72
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,840
Alright, so remember, this is not my idea.

73
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,840
If you want, you know Venom?

74
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,019
How he calls him Eddy?

75
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:37,639
Throughout the course of the movie?

76
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:39,820
You could put, like, Venom in here as, like,

77
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,440
Ed! Ed! Eddy!

78
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,440
That video would get, like, at least 12,000 views.

79
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:54,360
So, Sockhead, where are we gonna get enough ice to make snow cones?

80
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,360
I'm sure we could locate sufficient frost shavings in the backyard coolers of the neighborhood, kids, Eddy.

81
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,360
I love how much everybody hates this.

82
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,759
Alright, I gotta slow it down, because I got, like,

83
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,759
two or three everybody hates this

84
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:09,759
things in the first, like, five minutes of this stream.

85
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:14,299
Haven't I learned, I gotta stop, like,

86
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:16,299
intentionally hate this?

87
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:18,299
Collect ice cubes to make snow cones.

88
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:22,139
Select Ed by pressing R1.

89
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:24,139
Okay.

90
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,259
Select Ed, so you can cycle through.

91
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,259
When an object glows, it means that you can interact with it

92
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:31,440
by pressing the triangle button.

93
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,919
Alright, so there's, uh,

94
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,919
Okay, I got the,

95
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,919
I got the potato slicer.

96
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,919
Let's get ice cubes.

97
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:44,419
Throw shit? Okay.

98
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:46,909
Good work, Ed's special ability is to lift and throw objects.

99
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:48,909
And what do we got for, what is his move?

100
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:50,909
Press the square button to do basic attack.

101
00:10:50,909 --> 00:10:56,100
He has a power-up,

102
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,100
He has a power-up,

103
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,100
He has a power-up,

104
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:02,279
He has a punch, okay.

105
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,529
So the ice cubes are supposed to be,

106
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:12,840
from my understanding here,

107
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,840
they're like puzzle pieces from Banjo,

108
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,840
or stars from Mario.

109
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,840
Alright, so that's the,

110
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,840
so, don't be mad at me, I don't know who is who.

111
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,269
I'm just gonna say,

112
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:25,269
I'm gonna say Ed 1,

113
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:27,269
2, and 3.

114
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,269
Oh, he has an attack too.

115
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:34,049
And let's go.

116
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:36,049
Now, he has a slingshot.

117
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,179
Does Ed have a grenade?

118
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:42,179
Launch a stink bomb,

119
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:44,179
most enemies are stunned by stink bombs, okay.

120
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:49,299
They all have their own version of the Naruto run.

121
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:54,179
He looks like he's trying to do the Naruto run,

122
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:59,879
but he doesn't have any bones.

123
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,879
Stink bomb.

124
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:06,879
Okay, so we can push,

125
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:08,879
launch a stink bomb,

126
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:10,879
so, how do we launch him?

127
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,879
Press L1 with Ed,

128
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:15,059
to perform the battered Ed formation.

129
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:17,059
This move can be used to smash through objects.

130
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:25,639
Pretty awesome.

131
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:30,950
Pretty cool game, pretty fun.

132
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,950
If you liked this game back in the day,

133
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,950
that's cool, because it's good.

134
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:39,409
It's pretty good.

135
00:12:39,409 --> 00:12:43,759
How do I get this off? What's on me?

136
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:45,759
What is attached to me?

137
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,759
I have an animal on me.

138
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,759
Find a cat to lift and throw at the dog,

139
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:51,759
to get him away from the cooler.

140
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:54,320
How do I get this off me?

141
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,110
Ed's gonna die.

142
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:05,899
No, get off of me!

143
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:11,639
Alright, he died.

144
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:17,590
Watch out for the squirrel.

145
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,590
Why are there so many squirrels?

146
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,899
I gotta hit them.

147
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:23,899
Press L1 with Ed, digging the sand.

148
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:25,899
Chickens are present in each level.

149
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:27,899
Catch the chicken by stunning it.

150
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:29,899
And then grab it with Ed.

151
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:32,070
Watch out, watch out!

152
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:35,980
God damn it, which one of these is Ed?

153
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,980
Ed's the big one, right?

154
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:52,620
Ed is...

155
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,799
Let me try.

156
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,799
Chickens are present in each level.

157
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:58,799
Catch the chicken by stunning it, and then grab it.

158
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:00,799
Why do I have a fucking trash can?

159
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,039
Where did I get a trash can?

160
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:11,610
This one's Eddie, right?

161
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,610
The one with the sock in his head?

162
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:21,080
No, that's Ed.

163
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,460
Who's the one with the antenna?

164
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,080
This is Ed,

165
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,580
with 1D.

166
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,580
This is Eddie, right?

167
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,039
Also, Ed.

168
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:45,100
Ed's the big one.

169
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,279
Ed's the big one.

170
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,460
Eddie is the one...

171
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,700
Okay, Eddie's the one with the antenna.

172
00:14:51,700 --> 00:15:00,210
Eddie's the one with the yellow shirt.

173
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:05,330
Alright, let's go, get that cooler!

174
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:08,399
Got that cube.

175
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,399
There's a sandbox somewhere that I need to dig in.

176
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,649
Where's the sandbox?

177
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,649
Switch to Eddie.

178
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,980
No, I went all the way back to the part of the hut.

179
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,980
You're horrible at this.

180
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,980
Well, come on, man!

181
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,980
I haven't even seen the show!

182
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:34,159
I don't know what's going on in this TV show.

183
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:36,159
How can I be good at the game if I've never seen the show?

184
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,129
Okay, I need a cat.

185
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:50,480
Cat, cat, cat.

186
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,480
Is there a cat?

187
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,480
Cat the tree?

188
00:15:57,169 --> 00:16:00,629
I'll find a cat.

189
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:02,929
Alright, hold on.

190
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:04,929
No cat here, but I can dig in the sand.

191
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:14,980
Alright, that's Ed.

192
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,980
Ed's the one with 1D.

193
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,980
Costume piece.

194
00:16:23,409 --> 00:16:27,409
I really feel like Eddie would do a great Smash Mouth impression.

195
00:16:27,409 --> 00:16:29,409
Did he ever sing that song?

196
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:31,409
Any Smash Mouth songs?

197
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:33,409
I feel like he would be pretty good at it.

198
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:42,309
Get that cat.

199
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:45,059
They did that once?

200
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:47,490
Yeah, I would assume. This is a cat, right?

201
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:59,090
Alright, well I got another puzzle piece.

202
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,090
Why don't they all jump in the air at the same time when you collect it?

203
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,090
35. Alright, let's keep going.

204
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:09,619
No Eds allowed.

205
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:11,619
That's alright, I'm Eddie.

206
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:16,539
Cutscene.

207
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,900
Violence only begets violence, Eddie.

208
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,900
Do it, man, come on.

209
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,900
Okay, let's go.

210
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:48,740
What?

211
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,069
R2 button?

212
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:54,069
You can go into the FPS mode? You kidding me?

213
00:17:54,069 --> 00:18:01,180
Now jump on the picnic table and use Slingshot on Jimmy's dolls.

214
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:06,670
I can't go over there, though. Wait.

215
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,670
Is this a picnic table? This looks like just a plank of wood.

216
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,099
Alright, let's go.

217
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:16,730
How do I shoot it? Circle?

218
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:30,859
This bullet drop.

219
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:34,960
I did it, right?

220
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,200
How do I get out? Okay, let's go.

221
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
This is actually kind of fun.

222
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
I was talking a little shit at the beginning about how I was going to skip it.

223
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
But, it's not bad.

224
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
It's not bad.

225
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,700
I got 4 out of 5.

226
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,839
No, it's not bad. It's fun.

227
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:58,890
I mean, it could use a little work in the graphical department, but...

228
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:02,019
Nice!

229
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:04,019
Throw squirrels into the window of the house.

230
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:15,470
Why would I do that?

231
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,539
Like this house, right here.

232
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:22,640
No, yeah, I would have had it.

233
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,670
You got a fucking squirrel problem.

234
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:31,539
No, no, no, no, no, no!

235
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:33,539
Not the red squirrel! Get the red squirrel off me!

236
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:37,180
Get away from me!

237
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,180
No more red squirrel.

238
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:49,420
Dude, these stuff are...

239
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,420
They make cartoons...

240
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,420
Look at how good this cartoon was back in the day.

241
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,420
They had a whole orchestra.

242
00:19:55,599 --> 00:20:00,799
They had a whole jazz orchestra playing these songs to each episode.

243
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,170
They make these goddamn songs on a computer now.

244
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:08,329
Who's the jazz orchestra?

245
00:20:08,329 --> 00:20:15,240
There's a conductor.

246
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,240
And the special features of the Ed Edd and Eddie DVD.

247
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:26,880
You can see the whole orchestra play.

248
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,839
Uh, what?

249
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:33,519
How do you...

250
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:35,519
Listen, throw squirrels into the window of the house.

251
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:38,339
Isn't that what... Is this the wrong house?

252
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:40,339
What the fuck am I doing?

253
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,339
Why are we doing a cheerleading?

254
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:51,420
I think they'll do like a reunion episode.

255
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,420
When the actors come back, and they're a little too old,

256
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,779
and you can tell they're really trying.

257
00:20:55,779 --> 00:20:57,779
But they don't really... They sound different.

258
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:02,470
For some reason, the Simpsons...

259
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,609
The Simpsons voice actors sound exactly the same

260
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:07,609
as they did 30 years ago.

261
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:09,609
It's insane.

262
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:13,059
It's insane.

263
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:18,250
The person that does Lisa...

264
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,250
Still is the exact same voice.

265
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,250
Prepare to major doom!

266
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,250
But Edd and Eddie...

267
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:28,269
But Edd and Eddie... They were fucking talented people.

268
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:30,269
It was really cool.

269
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:32,269
They did great jobs.

270
00:21:32,269 --> 00:21:35,529
Two of them died. Oh god, that's terrible.

271
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:41,680
Wait, what was I supposed to...

272
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:49,799
Where am I taking the squirrel?

273
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,799
I forgot what to do already.

274
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:53,799
Yeah, I missed that cutscene because we were talking.

275
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:55,799
Well, I was talking.

276
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:57,799
You were watching me, uh...

277
00:21:57,799 --> 00:21:59,799
Forget where I was going while I was talking.

278
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:04,029
That's not true.

279
00:22:04,029 --> 00:22:09,279
Wait, what?

280
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:11,279
Hold on, wait, wait, wait.

281
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,299
We were talking.

282
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:17,299
Lift and throw the fridge at the door.

283
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:19,299
Alright, let's throw it at the fridge.

284
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:22,109
Hoi!

285
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:24,109
Okay, use the battering head.

286
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,109
Let's throw it in here.

287
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:28,609
Okay, so let's do the battering head.

288
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:32,509
How do I stop doing this?

289
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:34,509
I got the pot.

290
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:42,289
What is this thing? A coin?

291
00:22:42,289 --> 00:22:44,289
Ooh, I got two coins.

292
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:46,289
Three coins, four coins.

293
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,470
Three coins, four coins.

294
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:51,079
Oh, we did it.

295
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:53,759
That's it.

296
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:55,759
Let's do speedrun tactics, man.

297
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:59,859
This is faster.

298
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:01,859
Meatball machine.

299
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,170
He didn't really translate the 3D very well.

300
00:23:19,349 --> 00:23:21,349
He's got a very strange mouth.

301
00:23:21,349 --> 00:23:23,349
For 3D.

302
00:23:23,349 --> 00:23:25,349
It looks like Bart.

303
00:23:25,349 --> 00:23:28,490
That's like 55-year-old Bart Simpson.

304
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,490
Okay.

305
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:41,539
He is ugly.

306
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:44,039
Oh, pigs.

307
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:46,039
Batter and the pigs gate.

308
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:48,039
That should change Rolf's mind about the meatball.

309
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:07,539
Do I get to ride a pig?

310
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:09,779
Lift and throw the pigs back in the pen.

311
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,839
Okay.

312
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:14,839
Sounds easy enough.

313
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:19,579
I can't throw it over.

314
00:24:19,579 --> 00:24:23,039
I do appreciate the default pig sound.

315
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,039
Is it just minigames?

316
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:29,180
Probably.

317
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:37,359
Oh, come on.

318
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:39,359
Will he just walk in?

319
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:41,359
There we go.

320
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:43,359
One more? Two more?

321
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:48,279
This game is worse than I remember.

322
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,279
I think it still holds up.

323
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:52,279
I mean, I never played it.

324
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:57,019
Let's use the machine.

325
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,509
Is there another pig?

326
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:06,799
Can we use the machine?

327
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,740
Is there another pig somewhere?

328
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,740
Oh, the fucking red squirrel got me again.

329
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:19,869
He said yes.

330
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:22,500
Well, how do I get on it?

331
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,500
Get the red squirrel away from me.

332
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,759
Does the smart one have to use it?

333
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:39,470
How do I get back in this house?

334
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:43,819
No, there's another pig here.

335
00:25:43,819 --> 00:25:45,819
Look, can one of you party members just turn

336
00:25:45,819 --> 00:25:54,140
and just fucking blast that squirrel?

337
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,769
See?

338
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:06,869
See?

339
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:11,730
Stop running out.

340
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,730
They just keep running out.

341
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:20,200
I gotta go in his fucking shed.

342
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:25,319
Alright, let's activate the meatball machine.

343
00:26:28,069 --> 00:26:30,069
You just completed scam number one.

344
00:26:30,069 --> 00:26:32,069
Cool your head.

345
00:26:32,069 --> 00:26:34,690
10% game completion.

346
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:48,049
Fully animated?

347
00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:59,759
Kind of.

348
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:02,519
Stop eating those.

349
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:04,519
Why did you just turn into Skeeter from Doug?

350
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:17,430
Col de Sac.

351
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:21,849
Okay, we got a sewer.

352
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:23,849
It's open world.

353
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:25,849
Leave the level and go.

354
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:27,849
No, not yet.

355
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:31,819
Let's really examine

356
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:34,119
the suburbs of Ohio.

357
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,119
I don't even know where the hell they are.

358
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:39,940
What town were they in?

359
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,720
Anything else I can do?

360
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:51,720
I can imagine being a big fan of this show

361
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,720
when it was really, really popular.

362
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,900
And walking around

363
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,900
and like going in Jimmy's pool

364
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:00,079
and being like, wow!

365
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:04,920
Talking to Ralph.

366
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,920
Picking up paint cans. They love painting, right?

367
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,869
That never said where?

368
00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:13,869
Nah, let's just go to the next one.

369
00:28:13,869 --> 00:28:18,160
This one's in the sewer.

370
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,160
This show fucking sucked. I'm glad it died.

371
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,480
Wow! That's heavy, man.

372
00:28:38,329 --> 00:28:40,329
I know, I know!

373
00:28:40,329 --> 00:28:42,329
We can crawl through the stinky sewers

374
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:44,329
like the bacteria fusing blob

375
00:28:44,329 --> 00:28:46,329
and I was a teenage sludge hippie!

376
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:50,329
I don't know. It seems terribly risky

377
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:52,329
and unsanitary,

378
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:54,329
to say the least.

379
00:28:54,329 --> 00:28:56,329
It'll be a cinch!

380
00:28:56,329 --> 00:28:58,329
Come on, boys! We got a party to catch!

381
00:29:00,569 --> 00:29:02,569
I like this. This is very fun.

382
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:04,569
Pin the tail on the ed.

383
00:29:04,569 --> 00:29:13,849
The animation doesn't give

384
00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:16,029
any V-Show animation justice.

385
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:18,339
Yeah, but it is a PlayStation 2 game.

386
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:25,519
Find the way into Jimmy's backyard.

387
00:29:30,579 --> 00:29:32,579
Can you watch Ed Ed Nettie

388
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:34,579
with the whole thing anywhere?

389
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:37,200
Or do you have to buy the DVDs or Blu-Rays or something?

390
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,200
Is it possible to play this?

391
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,200
Not play this, but watch it?

392
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,200
I don't know.

393
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,200
It seems terribly risky

394
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,200
and unsanitary, to say the least.

395
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,200
Throw toxic waste?

396
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,380
Oh, shit. We're getting attacked by alligators.

397
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:58,440
The whole show is on YouTube.

398
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,440
What?

399
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,440
Well, I'm talking like a legal way to watch it.

400
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,450
Not like

401
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,450
Edfan2044

402
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,690
that uploads every video.

403
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,880
Oh, my God. Get the fucking out.

404
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,380
How do you kill the alligator?

405
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:28,329
Just dive through it.

406
00:30:28,329 --> 00:30:30,329
They're not gonna throw you in prison

407
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,329
for watching a YouTube show.

408
00:30:32,509 --> 00:30:34,509
It's elementary, Eddie.

409
00:30:34,509 --> 00:30:37,259
If we move down to the other side,

410
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:39,259
you two can lift me up to that crack.

411
00:30:39,259 --> 00:30:41,569
I'll lower the bridge, allowing us to cross together.

412
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,500
All right, switch to Ed and press L1

413
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,500
to enter Trampolad.

414
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,740
So we're gonna launch

415
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,740
Ed up there

416
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,170
to turn the dial.

417
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:02,819
Can we go in this?

418
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,819
Maybe we can.

419
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Is it poison or is it just not an alligator?

420
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,049
All right, do it.

421
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,420
No, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna lose.

422
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:29,410
You're killing them.

423
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:35,109
I'm gonna take their souls.

424
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:37,109
What are they doing? Oh, their pathing is

425
00:31:37,109 --> 00:31:39,109
getting up there.

426
00:31:39,109 --> 00:31:41,109
Where's the most powerful technique?

427
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:44,119
I can throw the, okay,

428
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:51,799
the stink bomb. All right, watch out.

429
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:56,099
I'm gonna collect their souls.

430
00:31:56,099 --> 00:31:58,099
No, no.

431
00:31:58,099 --> 00:32:00,099
It's okay.

432
00:32:00,099 --> 00:32:07,519
I don't think you can kill the alligators.

433
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,519
Maybe you can.

434
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,400
No, you definitely can't.

435
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,400
All right, all right, all right.

436
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,400
Okay, okay, easy, easy, easy.

437
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,279
I'm gonna have to, like,

438
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,279
battering ram that thing. Jesus Christ!

439
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,279
This thing is relentless!

440
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:29,829
Why is it still swimming on land?

441
00:32:29,829 --> 00:32:33,859
That doesn't make any sense.

442
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:36,039
This is not fair. This is fucking unfair.

443
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:44,589
All right, battering ram this.

444
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:46,589
Battering ram.

445
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,589
Now I need a key.

446
00:32:48,589 --> 00:32:54,859
All right, I have to get a key.

447
00:32:54,859 --> 00:32:56,859
I'm just gonna throw the grenade.

448
00:32:56,859 --> 00:32:58,859
Fuck it.

449
00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:02,640
How do I throw the grenade?

450
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,160
There it is.

451
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,160
Okay.

452
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,160
I need a key to open this door.

453
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:15,789
I gotta go back.

454
00:33:15,789 --> 00:33:17,789
Find key.

455
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:30,259
Key.

456
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,440
Why am I standing in?

457
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,680
Kill the alligators.

458
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,309
I don't think I can.

459
00:33:42,309 --> 00:33:44,309
I hit them, like, three or four times.

460
00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:47,440
They swim around like Aquaman,

461
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,440
and then you can't hurt them.

462
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,000
Let's try.

463
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,279
All right.

464
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,430
You can kill them.

465
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,430
All right, well, it's good to know.

466
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,430
I'm gonna find a key.

467
00:34:07,609 --> 00:34:09,610
Oh, that was a coin.

468
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,940
Can I throw these as many times as I want?

469
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:20,530
I can.

470
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,530
Let's get infinity mode.

471
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,630
Well, he's the best character in the game.

472
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:33,539
All right. Key.

473
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:35,900
No key.

474
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,900
No key. In barrel. Boxes.

475
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:44,690
Toxic waste.

476
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,690
If I was a key, where would I be hiding?

477
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:54,050
Does anybody have anything to say about this?

478
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:58,340
That's the Dark Souls shortcut.

479
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:00,949
Nothing in there.

480
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:09,719
So they said switch to Ed.

481
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,320
Wait, what?

482
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,320
You can just open locked doors?

483
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,320
When did you possess this skill?

484
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,320
Yeah, Ed knows how to pick locks.

485
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,360
I thought there was a key.

486
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,820
What do you mean?

487
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,820
I thought that was a joke.

488
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,820
I thought there was a key involved.

489
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:43,000
That's double D.

490
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
You charlatan.

491
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,940
All right, well, what's that down there?

492
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:54,460
What's that down there?

493
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:57,460
Got it?

494
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,460
This looks like a real Ed level.

495
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:04,329
What would happen if he didn't have double D?

496
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:10,420
Would they just die?

497
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,619
This should work.

498
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:15,619
Why am I calling it double D?

499
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:17,619
It's Ed.

500
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:20,309
Edward.

501
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,769
Why would they just stand around?

502
00:36:29,769 --> 00:36:33,219
Watch the show.

503
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,400
I've seen the show. I know the show.

504
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,400
I know about Plank.

505
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,400
Plank is his little friend.

506
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,400
Jimmy.

507
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,400
I know about

508
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,400
the sisters, right?

509
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,090
I've seen the show.

510
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:52,250
I know that they put jawbreakers

511
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:54,250
in their mouths.

512
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:57,000
All they care about is candy.

513
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,659
He's a fake fan.

514
00:37:03,659 --> 00:37:06,730
Name your favorite episode.

515
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:09,230
I can't do that.

516
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,230
I got like a clam on me now.

517
00:37:11,409 --> 00:37:16,210
I need to do something.

518
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,210
Who can touch these?

519
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:21,860
Favorite episode.

520
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,860
Favorite episode.

521
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:27,119
An episode of Ed, Edd, and Eddie

522
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,119
that I remember.

523
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,489
They got a super jawbreaker

524
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:33,489
one time, right?

525
00:37:33,489 --> 00:37:41,099
It was a huge one.

526
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:43,099
I'm going to try as hard as I can.

527
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:48,349
What is an episode

528
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,349
of Ed, Ed, and Eddie that I've ever seen?

529
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:54,380
But I can't even do that.

530
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,380
I can't do that.

531
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,360
But I can't even do that with the Simpsons.

532
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,989
Right?

533
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:03,989
Okay, name a Simpsons episode.

534
00:38:03,989 --> 00:38:05,989
Not like Treehouse of Horror.

535
00:38:05,989 --> 00:38:11,679
I can't.

536
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:16,099
There we go.

537
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:20,769
We got some doors here.

538
00:38:20,769 --> 00:38:23,519
Mr. Plow? Yeah, but that's

539
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:25,519
I guess like you just said that.

540
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:31,159
I didn't.

541
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:33,159
I'm trying. What is an episode of Ed, Ed, and Eddie

542
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:35,159
that I've ever seen?

543
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:37,329
I've seen a bunch of them a long time ago.

544
00:38:38,309 --> 00:38:45,340
Did somebody

545
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,340
steal a plank one time and replace it

546
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,340
with another piece of wood?

547
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:54,699
No.

548
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,699
You sure?

549
00:38:59,059 --> 00:39:01,059
Alright, I need to do something with the clam.

550
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,400
That didn't do anything.

551
00:39:16,739 --> 00:39:19,619
Fuck!

552
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:21,619
Alright, hold on.

553
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:23,619
There's an Ed King back here.

554
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,900
Just who cares?

555
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,900
I'm gonna bring you over here. Just drown the clam.

556
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:45,559
Do it! Do it!

557
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:47,559
What's this like Tomb Raider bullshit? Like you gotta be right in front of it? Come on!

558
00:39:57,809 --> 00:40:01,269
Alright, got it.

559
00:40:01,269 --> 00:40:03,269
Chicken!

560
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:05,269
Chicken! Chicken!

561
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:12,760
I got it!

562
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,989
Bingo. Two out of six.

563
00:40:17,989 --> 00:40:23,679
Alright, nothing else over here?

564
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,710
I can't name an episode.

565
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:32,260
An episode.

566
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,260
Even one plot device.

567
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,619
I don't know.

568
00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:40,980
Get off me, please.

569
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:49,039
I'm just gonna farm HP.

570
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:52,820
I need a better, like an

571
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,820
attacker. Here we go.

572
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,719
Now you guys have given a lot of good

573
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:00,719
answers here, but those are not my answers.

574
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:08,190
Involved

575
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:19,119
in an episode.

576
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:25,199
Let me look around here.

577
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:27,199
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

578
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:30,079
No, you can't say next.

579
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,079
You can't do that yet.

580
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,079
Fuck, it's been forty-one minutes!

581
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,469
I can't

582
00:41:37,469 --> 00:41:39,469
leave this game until I tell

583
00:41:39,469 --> 00:41:41,469
you a Ed, Edd, and Eddie

584
00:41:41,469 --> 00:41:43,469
plot device from one episode that I've ever seen.

585
00:41:43,469 --> 00:41:45,469
I refuse.

586
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:48,929
I

587
00:41:48,929 --> 00:41:50,929
would be upset at myself if I

588
00:41:50,929 --> 00:41:56,940
didn't do that.

589
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:04,750
It's like a lever I have to pull.

590
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:08,210
He says that.

591
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:10,210
Is there one word like Ed

592
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:12,210
Is there one word like Ed is not smart?

593
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:14,210
He doesn't, like he gets like

594
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:16,449
dumb or something?

595
00:42:16,449 --> 00:42:18,449
He's not that smart and they realize that they need his intelligence

596
00:42:18,449 --> 00:42:21,070
or something?

597
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:28,500
He gets like dumb? Yes, yes.

598
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,949
No, I'm talking about like Double D.

599
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:33,949
Double D like loses his brain power or something, right?

600
00:42:33,949 --> 00:42:35,949
Like gets his brain power dumb how

601
00:42:35,949 --> 00:42:39,789
messed up? And they spend the whole episode

602
00:42:39,789 --> 00:42:46,639
trying to get him smart again?

603
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:48,639
Or is that, was that, so Edd gets

604
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:50,639
really, no, Eddie, no, Edd,

605
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:52,639
this one, gets really smart in an

606
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:55,650
episode, right?

607
00:42:55,650 --> 00:43:00,130
No.

608
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:02,130
Yes, I'm not stalling. I'm trying to figure

609
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:05,389
it out. I was right the first

610
00:43:05,389 --> 00:43:07,389
time. Alright, so I can stop playing then.

611
00:43:07,389 --> 00:43:11,300
Thanks for watching. No, I'm kidding.

612
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,659
I can't leave until I open this

613
00:43:13,659 --> 00:43:18,139
door. What about like the Edd Ram?

614
00:43:18,139 --> 00:43:27,170
No, I eBayed. I

615
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:29,170
eBayed this game. You think I'm just gonna stop playing it?

616
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:32,239
I had to buy this on eBay.

617
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:34,670
It took three

618
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:37,099
weeks to get here. It was

619
00:43:37,099 --> 00:43:41,519
78 bucks total.

620
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:44,400
I'm kidding. It's a lie. How do I do this?

621
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:52,780
Am I missing

622
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,780
something here? Am I missing

623
00:43:54,780 --> 00:44:00,480
an episode?

624
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,409
I have to switch to Edd. How do I

625
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:07,409
get such bad deals? I'm just kidding. This was not

626
00:44:07,409 --> 00:44:09,409
80 bucks. He's blind.

627
00:44:09,409 --> 00:44:11,969
Wait.

628
00:44:11,969 --> 00:44:13,969
Maybe I am. Maybe I am.

629
00:44:13,969 --> 00:44:15,969
What do I have to do with Edd?

630
00:44:15,969 --> 00:44:17,969
Touch this thing? The like elephant trunk?

631
00:44:17,969 --> 00:44:19,969
Grab the elephant trunk and spin it.

632
00:44:19,969 --> 00:44:26,420
Oh, come on.

633
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,420
Look, hold on a minute.

634
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,420
This is like, how many pizzas are there here?

635
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:32,420
There's at least five

636
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,420
pizza-shaped things here. Look, there's one here.

637
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:36,420
There's the elephant trunk that I made

638
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:41,340
before I mentioned.

639
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,340
It's only glowing when

640
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,340
you have Edd selected.

641
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,340
And I had my favorite character, which is

642
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,340
Eddie, selected. So it doesn't

643
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:51,969
light up. You get it?

644
00:44:51,969 --> 00:44:55,940
It only lights up when you have the person

645
00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:08,030
that can do the reactions selected.

646
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:10,030
My favorite part about Edd and Eddie is nothing to do

647
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:12,030
with the show. It's when the guy

648
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:14,030
goes...

649
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:16,980
After that happens, I just turn to the channel.

650
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:27,920
I change the channel. I went in a fucking

651
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,869
circle.

652
00:45:31,869 --> 00:45:33,869
I can't like, talk. Stop talking.

653
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:38,219
Frankly, I'm disgusted.

654
00:45:38,219 --> 00:45:40,219
You don't know which Edd you are. I know exactly which

655
00:45:40,219 --> 00:45:46,820
Edd I am.

656
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,820
Was there an episode where one of their cousins

657
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:51,760
like Fred showed up?

658
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,760
Do I get bonus points for that one?

659
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,110
Weren't there three other like

660
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:00,110
Edd, Edd, and Eddie? Oh, fuck.

661
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:02,110
No, I'm fine. There are three

662
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:04,110
other Edd, Edd, and Eddie's that show up in an episode, right?

663
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:13,260
No, not the girls.

664
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:23,619
Okay, easy.

665
00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:25,619
Wait, didn't I...

666
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:29,199
Hold on. Did I...

667
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:31,949
Where's my map?

668
00:46:31,949 --> 00:46:33,949
Where's my map?

669
00:46:33,949 --> 00:46:35,949
I need to press select and see like the coordinates

670
00:46:35,949 --> 00:46:40,820
of where I am.

671
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:42,820
Where's my dungeon map?

672
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:45,820
How come you don't have one of those, Edd?

673
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,820
Okay, remember this? Yep, yep, yep.

674
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:52,179
Alright.

675
00:46:52,179 --> 00:46:54,610
I can't take this laugh anymore.

676
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:56,610
Alright, then I had the rats here.

677
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:58,610
And then that door.

678
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:00,610
Is there... Okay, wait. Is there...

679
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:02,610
Can I open this?

680
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:04,610
Is there like another blind moment?

681
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:06,610
See, what about this one?

682
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:09,679
I can't use that one.

683
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:11,679
What about... I'm just checking. I'm just checking to make sure I don't...

684
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:13,679
Fuck it up. Look at that.

685
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:25,710
Why does he keep laughing? Because things are funny.

686
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:27,710
Some things are funny.

687
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:36,380
Don't lose here.

688
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,380
They're blocking the way.

689
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:42,380
I feel like I'm really neglecting

690
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:44,380
the single Edd, right? No, double Edd.

691
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:46,380
No, the Eddie.

692
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,380
Two syllable Edd.

693
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:50,880
I'm neglecting him.

694
00:47:57,409 --> 00:47:59,900
That's a tough pole here.

695
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:03,039
Got it. Nice.

696
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:05,409
I'm like a fucking lightning rod right now.

697
00:48:05,409 --> 00:48:07,409
That was fucking so hard.

698
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:17,969
Next. Next. No!

699
00:48:20,139 --> 00:48:22,139
Not until I... Edd Batteringram!

700
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:30,530
Let's Edd break that, right?

701
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:35,519
Secret room?

702
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:37,699
No, alligator.

703
00:48:45,699 --> 00:48:47,699
Connect the names with the right characters or fake fans.

704
00:48:47,699 --> 00:48:49,699
Sure.

705
00:48:49,699 --> 00:48:54,539
Okay. By the way,

706
00:48:54,539 --> 00:48:56,539
I never told you I was a fan of this show.

707
00:48:56,539 --> 00:48:58,539
I told you I've seen the show and that I thought it was okay.

708
00:48:58,539 --> 00:49:00,539
I thought it was great.

709
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:02,719
Let's start from the beginning.

710
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:04,719
This is Edd with two Ds. This is double D.

711
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:07,980
This is

712
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,980
E-D-D-Y. Eddie.

713
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,980
And this is E-D.

714
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:14,610
Edd.

715
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:16,610
They're corrected.

716
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:23,010
Something else in here I can do.

717
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:25,500
And then

718
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,869
somebody...

719
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:30,239
Didn't somebody...

720
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:33,309
DW?

721
00:49:33,309 --> 00:49:36,320
Is it like one of these Edds like...

722
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,320
No, that's Arthur.

723
00:49:44,699 --> 00:49:47,900
Edd-D-W.

724
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,900
No, that's the intro in Arthur.

725
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,530
What happened to that show?

726
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:56,750
You play for long and you unlock

727
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:58,750
the secret fourth Edd.

728
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:00,750
Yeah. Nice fake fan,

729
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,750
by the way.

730
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:13,230
Remember, like,

731
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:15,230
name the characters correctly or you're a fake fan.

732
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:17,230
What about the guy who just said there's a fourth Edd?

733
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:19,659
What are we going to say about that guy?

734
00:50:19,659 --> 00:50:28,179
Oh, nice. Job record.

735
00:50:28,179 --> 00:50:31,489
Is that a secret?

736
00:50:31,489 --> 00:50:33,659
There's 40 of those.

737
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:39,360
Judge Dredd.

738
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:46,139
Ten years, punk.

739
00:50:49,139 --> 00:50:51,139
The fourth Edd. Judge Dredd.

740
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,820
Dredd, Edd, Edd, and Eddie.

741
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,820
Edd, Dredd,

742
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:01,860
Edd, Edd, Dredd, and Eddie.

743
00:51:23,059 --> 00:51:25,059
I was...

744
00:51:25,059 --> 00:51:27,059
I can't do...

745
00:51:27,059 --> 00:51:29,059
I can't say that.

746
00:51:29,059 --> 00:51:31,059
It's too dumb.

747
00:51:31,059 --> 00:51:34,449
Somebody already did it. I'm not doing it.

748
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:52,690
Alright. Turn the valves to lower the water level.

749
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:55,309
Okay!

750
00:51:55,309 --> 00:52:02,659
I need that.

751
00:52:02,659 --> 00:52:04,659
New valves over here.

752
00:52:04,659 --> 00:52:06,659
Oh, Edd's dead.

753
00:52:06,659 --> 00:52:09,539
Edd's dead. Sorry, Edd.

754
00:52:09,539 --> 00:52:13,119
Somebody said loser.

755
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:15,679
No, no, no. Get off.

756
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:17,679
Edd fell in the water.

757
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:30,030
And he was never heard from again.

758
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:34,059
He fart-joked.

759
00:52:34,059 --> 00:52:36,059
You guys are acting like I made that joke.

760
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:38,690
I didn't.

761
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:43,739
What the hell was that? Was that Coraline?

762
00:52:43,739 --> 00:52:46,050
Coraline! Open the door!

763
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:48,050
Don't tuck them all in there!

764
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:50,739
Get out of there!

765
00:52:50,739 --> 00:53:02,750
It's not what it seems!

766
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:08,900
Okay, there's one. The water's going down.

767
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:13,360
There's one over there.

768
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,940
Okay. Easy.

769
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:19,889
Edd. Eddie.

770
00:53:19,889 --> 00:53:22,380
Do I throw somebody?

771
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:26,380
Is that it?

772
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:28,380
Where's one of the valves?

773
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:30,380
We gotta get down there.

774
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:36,130
I can't tell. It's kind of blurry.

775
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:38,130
Can I throw him?

776
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:42,219
There's not one.

777
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:48,820
Please stop this game already.

778
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:50,820
No, why?

779
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:52,820
It's fun.

780
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:57,489
I'm begging you. I'm starving.

781
00:53:57,489 --> 00:53:59,920
Let me at least get to the end of this.

782
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,920
This is a fun game.

783
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,099
Well, I obviously have to go down there.

784
00:54:04,099 --> 00:54:06,099
Is there one over there?

785
00:54:09,739 --> 00:54:11,739
I don't know who that was.

786
00:54:11,739 --> 00:54:13,739
That was just Carrot Top.

787
00:54:13,739 --> 00:54:15,739
I still have a clam on me.

788
00:54:17,739 --> 00:54:20,929
We're starved for good content.

789
00:54:22,929 --> 00:54:24,929
Come on.

790
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:26,929
You don't like this?

791
00:54:26,929 --> 00:54:29,619
Alright.

792
00:54:29,619 --> 00:54:31,619
This is one of the most requested video games

793
00:54:31,619 --> 00:54:33,619
I've ever had on the channel.

794
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:35,860
You asked me

795
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:37,860
to make you scrambled eggs

796
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:39,860
with like cheese in it.

797
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,860
Pepper, onions. I sit there all day

798
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:43,860
and I'm at the stove and I'm cooking all these

799
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:45,860
weird eggs you ordered. You want like

800
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:47,860
hollandaise on it too. I'm like really?

801
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,860
You want like hollandaise sauce?

802
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:51,860
Yeah. And then I put this fucking

803
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,860
meal in front of you and you're like

804
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:55,860
I don't like the way that smells.

805
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,860
Get rid of it. And I'm like I just

806
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,860
I thought you wanted this. You wanted eggs with hollandaise.

807
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:03,500
And then like the rest of the families

808
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,190
at the table.

809
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:08,190
Like the 300 family members that I have.

810
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:10,190
I wanted pancakes.

811
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:12,190
And I'm just like I don't have

812
00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:14,190
the materials for pancakes right now.

813
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:16,190
Get them mom.

814
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:18,190
I can't. The store's closed.

815
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,190
And then you back up and you

816
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:23,900
walk out. You like go to

817
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:29,219
your room. No.

818
00:55:29,219 --> 00:55:31,219
Mom made what mom made. If you don't like it

819
00:55:31,219 --> 00:55:33,219
then that's too bad.

820
00:55:33,219 --> 00:55:35,219
You gotta eat it.

821
00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:37,219
It's got broccoli. It's got spinach in it.

822
00:55:37,219 --> 00:55:39,219
Spinach. It's gonna make you grow up big and strong.

823
00:55:39,219 --> 00:55:41,219
Ed Ed and Eddie will make you grow up big and strong.

824
00:55:41,219 --> 00:55:43,219
As long as you don't. Hold on.

825
00:55:43,219 --> 00:55:48,510
I'm gonna die.

826
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:50,940
I gotta get up there.

827
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:53,889
I gotta do the Ed spring.

828
00:55:53,889 --> 00:55:57,599
Come on. Get me up there.

829
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:03,039
This one fucking clam.

830
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:07,329
No!

831
00:56:07,329 --> 00:56:09,820
How do I like close

832
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:14,179
the clams mouth?

833
00:56:14,179 --> 00:56:16,349
That's it. Alright.

834
00:56:16,349 --> 00:56:20,300
I beat it.

835
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,860
Alright Jimmy. Let's go.

836
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,860
You don't get killed by a clam but I do.

837
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:32,719
Alright.

838
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:38,460
Now what? Drawbreaker.

839
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:46,210
I'm just kidding man. Don't worry.

840
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:48,769
Do what you want. Ignore the chat.

841
00:56:48,769 --> 00:56:50,769
I'm just playing around.

842
00:56:50,769 --> 00:56:52,769
I know you guys are too.

843
00:56:52,769 --> 00:56:54,769
Don't worry. I know you guys really do love Ed Ed and Eddie.

844
00:56:56,769 --> 00:56:58,769
I know you do. That's why I'm gonna keep playing.

845
00:56:58,769 --> 00:57:00,769
Jimmy what's wrong with you?

846
00:57:00,769 --> 00:57:02,769
Jimmy. Walk down here.

847
00:57:02,769 --> 00:57:04,769
Oh no.

848
00:57:04,769 --> 00:57:07,630
Please don't come back to do it again.

849
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:11,469
Okay. We're good.

850
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:17,539
Jimmy what do you want?

851
00:57:17,539 --> 00:57:19,710
Jimmy. Hello.

852
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:39,389
Um. Where do I go?

853
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:41,389
Down here?

854
00:57:41,389 --> 00:57:51,039
Take the valve.

855
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:54,050
Do you just leave it up there?

856
00:57:54,050 --> 00:58:00,449
Oh.

857
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:07,039
Your best pal.

858
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:12,159
So how about that valve Johnny?

859
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:15,469
Bring it on you.

860
00:58:15,469 --> 00:58:17,469
Just give us the valve and I'll give you a plank.

861
00:58:17,469 --> 00:58:19,469
Plank says you are tricky.

862
00:58:19,469 --> 00:58:25,420
Double D. Let's install that valve

863
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:27,420
and we're done with it.

864
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,420
No I made that valve. I installed that valve.

865
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:42,989
I did that.

866
00:58:42,989 --> 00:58:44,989
Why are you guys writing gay band?

867
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:54,000
Where's the gay band coming from?

868
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
The rods are bigger. They're getting thicker.

869
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,650
Oh it's cause of the

870
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:01,650
valve thing right?

871
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:05,789
People still making that joke

872
00:59:05,789 --> 00:59:07,789
in like 2019.

873
00:59:07,789 --> 00:59:09,789
Like the gay band.

874
00:59:09,789 --> 00:59:11,789
I'm still getting that reference and joke

875
00:59:11,789 --> 00:59:13,789
in 2019.

876
00:59:13,789 --> 00:59:15,789
We are?

877
00:59:15,789 --> 00:59:18,590
No we're not.

878
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:27,150
He's here.

879
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:29,150
Everybody hates valve.

880
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:31,150
That's not true. They got three VR

881
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:33,150
games coming up. That's what I heard.

882
00:59:37,519 --> 00:59:41,230
What would you guys do if I just turned on the webcam right now

883
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:43,230
and just fucking sprinted out of the room

884
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:45,230
and in the chair like I was

885
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:47,230
just clicking around and I ran out of the room

886
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:49,230
and Gabe Newell's in the chair.

887
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:51,230
Here. And he started talking about his favorite

888
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:58,480
What would that be worth?

889
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,440
And by the way he's getting the

890
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,440
names wrong. Would you guys still say that shit?

891
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,440
To Gabe Newell?

892
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,440
I really like how Ed

893
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,440
he's the tall one right?

894
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,440
With two D's. Everyone would be like

895
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:27,809
idiot. No you wouldn't.

896
01:00:27,809 --> 01:00:35,619
I've heard of diversion. So I have to break the trampolines.

897
01:00:35,619 --> 01:00:40,480
I mean break the

898
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:44,380
pinatas. Where are the pinatas?

899
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:46,380
Because we

900
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:48,380
like Gabe

901
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,380
Newell.

902
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,380
Okay you can chop.

903
01:00:52,380 --> 01:01:05,309
Because we like Gabe

904
01:01:05,309 --> 01:01:07,309
Newell.

905
01:01:07,309 --> 01:01:09,309
I'm mean.

906
01:01:09,309 --> 01:01:11,309
And I'm not going to stand for it.

907
01:01:11,309 --> 01:01:18,139
Crap.

908
01:01:18,139 --> 01:01:21,090
I mean this area does.

909
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:26,340
This is a Playstation 2 game.

910
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:28,340
Come on.

911
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:37,420
He's like the Phil's very

912
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:41,519
dope boy.

913
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:45,550
He's making me laugh.

914
01:01:45,550 --> 01:01:55,730
Cutscene incoming.

915
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:06,780
What are they called? The Grunge Sisters?

916
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:19,710
Fake fan. Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

917
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:21,889
Hold on. Wait. I didn't know

918
01:02:21,889 --> 01:02:24,699
I have to go. Beehives.

919
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:30,210
Shoot the beehives. Pop a fridge on them?

920
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:34,750
Alright.

921
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:36,929
This reminds me of those

922
01:02:36,929 --> 01:02:38,929
old flash games.

923
01:02:38,929 --> 01:02:42,960
I'm dead.

924
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,960
I gotta like time it when they run across the screen.

925
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:49,440
Because I can't hit them with this.

926
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,440
Stun stun stun.

927
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:55,340
Right there. Right there.

928
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:57,900
Get it. Bingo.

929
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:59,900
Right here.

930
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:06,030
No I can't. Oh she was standing

931
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:08,030
right there. Right here. Right at this one.

932
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:10,030
Drop a fridge on her head.

933
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:13,090
Got it.

934
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:18,780
Back into the sewer.

935
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:23,579
Oh god.

936
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:28,619
Did I get it?

937
01:03:28,619 --> 01:03:30,619
I don't think I got it.

938
01:03:30,619 --> 01:03:35,420
That's a laugh.

939
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:37,730
That laugh is driving me crazy.

940
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:48,349
There's more.

941
01:03:48,349 --> 01:03:50,590
All the way down.

942
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:57,739
Get it.

943
01:03:57,739 --> 01:04:02,210
Don't do the laugh.

944
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:04,639
Please.

945
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:10,139
And then right here. Shit. Drop it on her head.

946
01:04:10,139 --> 01:04:12,139
Got it. No I didn't.

947
01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:17,949
Got it. You just completed

948
01:04:17,949 --> 01:04:19,949
this game too. Pin the tail on the head. Current game

949
01:04:19,949 --> 01:04:27,380
19%.

950
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:33,840
Animatic cutscene.

951
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,210
Too bad the party is over dorks.

952
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:38,210
Miniclips gave 50 bucks.

953
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:42,820
Are you kidding me? I'm Jimmy.

954
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:44,820
There's gotta be some cake left right?

955
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:46,820
Here.

956
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:48,820
You can lick the icing from my candle.

957
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:55,579
Gross.

958
01:04:55,579 --> 01:04:58,849
What was that face? That didn't even look like him.

959
01:04:58,849 --> 01:05:01,920
Miniclips gave 50 bucks.

960
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,920
Thank you for the 50 dollars

961
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,480

962
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,480

964
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,449
Keep up the good work.

965
01:05:14,449 --> 01:05:16,449
Thank you for the 50 dollars. I really appreciate it.

966
01:05:16,449 --> 01:05:25,150
Alright so

967
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:27,710

968
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:30,269
thank you. That's a lot of money.

969
01:05:30,269 --> 01:05:32,269
Alright here's the deal. If I get this

970
01:05:32,269 --> 01:05:34,269
basket in the net

971
01:05:34,269 --> 01:05:36,699
first try

972
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:39,070
I will keep playing the game.

973
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:41,070
If I don't get it first try

974
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:45,619
then I'm gonna keep playing.

975
01:05:45,619 --> 01:05:50,800
Alright let's keep going.

976
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,230
Is that what it feels like?

977
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:55,539
No please.

978
01:05:55,539 --> 01:05:57,539
Just, you're gonna have to wait.

979
01:05:57,539 --> 01:05:59,539
Okay. I gotta do

980
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:04,210
no I don't. Let's just see what

981
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,210
the next one is. We're gonna just see what the next one is.

982
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:09,280
Let's at least see the animation.

983
01:06:23,309 --> 01:06:25,309
Okay so we have to go

984
01:06:25,309 --> 01:06:27,309
Jimmy's birthday

985
01:06:27,309 --> 01:06:29,309
Jimmy's birthday

986
01:06:33,869 --> 01:06:35,869
Did Jimmy have a birthday every day?

987
01:06:35,869 --> 01:06:37,869
It's his second birthday in a row.

988
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:39,869
That's what we're banned from.

989
01:06:45,519 --> 01:06:47,519
It's his crown hog day.

990
01:06:47,519 --> 01:06:49,519
I did something wrong. I have to correct it.

991
01:06:52,139 --> 01:06:54,139
The world is trying to teach me

992
01:06:54,139 --> 01:06:56,579
something.

993
01:06:56,579 --> 01:07:03,300
Oh okay.

994
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:05,300
Jerma, I'm actually gonna leave.

995
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:08,880
Well I

996
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:13,039
can't stop you.

997
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:22,380
Exit of the cul-de-sac.

998
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:26,420
Come on we got three days

999
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:28,420
in a row to do

1000
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:30,420
just let me enjoy my video game.

1001
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:33,230
This is

1002
01:07:33,230 --> 01:07:37,139
$150 for me to buy this.

1003
01:07:37,139 --> 01:07:39,139
This shady guy, I had to like go meet him

1004
01:07:39,139 --> 01:07:41,139
in like a fucking alleyway.

1005
01:07:41,139 --> 01:07:43,139
You wanted an Eddie?

1006
01:07:43,139 --> 01:07:45,139
Yeah man like I heard from

1007
01:07:45,139 --> 01:07:47,139
Craigslist you were selling that Eddie?

1008
01:07:47,139 --> 01:07:49,139
Yeah.

1009
01:07:49,139 --> 01:07:51,500
You wanted anything else?

1010
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,869
No just Ed, Edd, and Eddie.

1011
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:55,869
Like five guys like kind of appeared

1012
01:07:55,869 --> 01:07:57,869
out of the shadows with like huge leather jackets on

1013
01:07:57,869 --> 01:07:59,869
and they had like spiked clubs and stuff.

1014
01:07:59,869 --> 01:08:03,579
They're like surrounding me.

1015
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:05,579
I just gave the guy a fucking wad of hundreds

1016
01:08:05,579 --> 01:08:18,689
and walked away and he gave me the disc.

1017
01:08:18,689 --> 01:08:24,770
What's over here?

1018
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:26,770
Okay here we go, a new place.

1019
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:28,770
Yeah and then I heard something behind me as I was walking

1020
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:30,770
to my car, the fucking Lamborghini by the way.

1021
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:32,770
It's a beautiful car.

1022
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:34,770
And I'm just kind of swinging my keys around

1023
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:36,770
just like kind of a little nervous.

1024
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:38,770
I hear like you know footsteps behind me.

1025
01:08:38,770 --> 01:08:41,010
And they got close enough

1026
01:08:41,010 --> 01:08:43,010
where I was able to

1027
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:45,010
I was able to change

1028
01:08:45,010 --> 01:08:47,010
my hair in

1029
01:08:47,010 --> 01:08:49,010
like five minutes my hair changed.

1030
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:51,010
It was weird because the guy was behind me but I noticed

1031
01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:53,010
that my hair changed completely.

1032
01:08:53,010 --> 01:08:55,010
I heard the steps.

1033
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:57,010
Grabbed the guy in a fucking stone cold stone headlock

1034
01:08:57,010 --> 01:08:59,380
and then flipped him.

1035
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:01,380
Alright well I just broke my head.

1036
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:05,539
That's it.

1037
01:09:05,539 --> 01:09:08,609
Where's the thing that was on it?

1038
01:09:08,609 --> 01:09:11,869
I can't even use this.

1039
01:09:11,869 --> 01:09:14,939
I ripped off the thing

1040
01:09:14,939 --> 01:09:24,800
that was on it.

1041
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,800
There was like a piece of jelly that was attached to it and now

1042
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,800
I don't know where it is.

1043
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:33,649
I can't even use the headphones now.

1044
01:09:33,649 --> 01:09:35,649
I got it.

1045
01:09:35,649 --> 01:09:41,390
Everything's fine.

1046
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:43,390
I got it. See?

1047
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:45,390
Everything's just fine.

1048
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:48,210
There it is.

1049
01:09:48,210 --> 01:09:50,210
Don't worry about it. Everything's fine.

1050
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:53,659
If that may have already been like that.

1051
01:09:53,659 --> 01:09:57,949
I don't know. Which ear is this for?

1052
01:09:57,949 --> 01:10:05,819
There's earwax on it. That's not earwax.

1053
01:10:05,819 --> 01:10:07,819
There's a hair on it.

1054
01:10:07,819 --> 01:10:10,579
What do you say earwax?

1055
01:10:10,579 --> 01:10:13,819
Buddy.

1056
01:10:13,819 --> 01:10:15,819
There's hair all over this though. That's like dog hair.

1057
01:10:15,819 --> 01:10:17,819
That's not my hair.

1058
01:10:17,819 --> 01:10:20,579
Let's try to reattach this.

1059
01:10:20,579 --> 01:10:31,579
This one.

1060
01:10:31,579 --> 01:10:39,460
There's hair all over me.

1061
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:41,460
You put earbuds in your dog's ears?

1062
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:43,460
No. What?

1063
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:57,659
No this is the wrong one.

1064
01:10:57,659 --> 01:11:04,319
Alright.

1065
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:06,319
Good as new.

1066
01:11:06,319 --> 01:11:09,779
See? This is supposed to be attached.

1067
01:11:09,779 --> 01:11:11,779
But whatever. It goes in here.

1068
01:11:11,779 --> 01:11:14,270
The jelly. I can just stuff it in there.

1069
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:21,060
We're fine. Everything's good.

1070
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:28,159
It's like a hearing aid.

1071
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:30,159
Leave the cam on? I don't want to.

1072
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:49,100
I'm laughing at that.

1073
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:58,000
It's funny.

1074
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,239
Must be something IED.

1075
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:04,529
Wow. I didn't know what that was until

1076
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:06,529
it was revealed.

1077
01:12:06,529 --> 01:12:08,529
Get to the candy store fast

1078
01:12:08,529 --> 01:12:10,529
for free jawbreakers.

1079
01:12:10,529 --> 01:12:16,670
I don't think you said

1080
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:19,550
it wasn't kill squirrels.

1081
01:12:22,939 --> 01:12:26,260
How do I get out of my backyard?

1082
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:29,329
Do the edge jump?

1083
01:12:29,329 --> 01:12:31,329
No, no, no.

1084
01:12:31,329 --> 01:12:35,229
The jump.

1085
01:12:35,229 --> 01:12:38,819
Episode was it?

1086
01:12:38,819 --> 01:12:46,989
No. I have to jump on this.

1087
01:12:46,989 --> 01:12:51,279
Oops.

1088
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:58,619
How am I not annoyed by the game?

1089
01:12:58,619 --> 01:13:01,760
I don't know.

1090
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:04,829
I don't know.

1091
01:13:04,829 --> 01:13:06,829
Why the hell are you still playing?

1092
01:13:06,829 --> 01:13:08,829
I don't know. I don't know.

1093
01:13:08,829 --> 01:13:10,829
Why not? I don't know.

1094
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:21,060
I don't know.

1095
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:23,060
How do I get out of my backyard?

1096
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:28,560
I'm going to jump on this.

1097
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:37,979
Go through the house.

1098
01:13:37,979 --> 01:13:40,289
I can't open the door.

1099
01:13:40,289 --> 01:13:44,960
The door doesn't open.

1100
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,960
Break the door.

1101
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,960
I can't smash the door.

1102
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:55,659
Maybe bash this?

1103
01:13:55,659 --> 01:13:57,659
Ooh, baby.

1104
01:13:57,659 --> 01:13:59,970
What did you look at that?

1105
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:01,970
So anyway, the guy comes up behind me

1106
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:03,970
and I fucking, I'm right in his fucking head.

1107
01:14:03,970 --> 01:14:07,739
You know what I mean?

1108
01:14:07,739 --> 01:14:09,739
Don't fucking look at my armpit hair.

1109
01:14:09,739 --> 01:14:11,739
I swear to God I'll be mad at you.

1110
01:14:17,069 --> 01:14:20,270
Look, it's the winter time, okay?

1111
01:14:20,270 --> 01:14:22,270
I clean up.

1112
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:24,270
It's cold. I don't like

1113
01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:27,859
to wear tank tops.

1114
01:14:27,859 --> 01:14:29,859
I clean up. I do a little bit of maintenance.

1115
01:14:29,859 --> 01:14:31,859
It's goddamn

1116
01:14:31,859 --> 01:14:38,260
February, alright?

1117
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:48,939
The Tower of Ed.

1118
01:14:48,939 --> 01:14:50,939
Make fun of that for one second.

1119
01:14:50,939 --> 01:14:54,850
I swear to God I'll never stream again.

1120
01:14:54,850 --> 01:14:56,850
You're going to see my face again?

1121
01:14:56,850 --> 01:14:59,220
Has anyone ever actually said something like that?

1122
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:08,880
This is actually really hard.

1123
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,880
Again.

1124
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:24,960
I'm telling you.

1125
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,960
This is really difficult.

1126
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,960
You're never going to see me again.

1127
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:34,590
Um, guys.

1128
01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:36,590
Guys, guys, guys. Guys, it's hard.

1129
01:15:36,590 --> 01:15:39,340
Guys, I'm telling you.

1130
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:41,340
This might look bad. It's going to look really bad.

1131
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:43,340
You're going to think I'm an idiot.

1132
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:45,340
I'm telling you, once I get to this hitbox,

1133
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:49,060
the second plank, all hell breaks loose.

1134
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:57,569
Oh, so nerve-racking.

1135
01:15:57,569 --> 01:15:59,569
I'm like a fucking lightning bolt right now.

1136
01:15:59,569 --> 01:16:12,289
There's one of those girls.

1137
01:16:12,289 --> 01:16:14,289
What's that sound? What do they sound like?

1138
01:16:14,289 --> 01:16:17,359
Right there.

1139
01:16:17,359 --> 01:16:19,359
There it is!

1140
01:16:19,359 --> 01:16:23,779
There it is!

1141
01:16:23,779 --> 01:16:27,149
Yeah!

1142
01:16:27,149 --> 01:16:29,149
See, I told you I knew what the show was.

1143
01:16:29,149 --> 01:16:32,930
See, I told you I knew what the show was.

1144
01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:39,949
Grab high-placed objects.

1145
01:16:39,949 --> 01:16:48,399
Grab high-placed objects.

1146
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:50,399
I'm going to walk around and pick them up.

1147
01:16:50,399 --> 01:16:53,920
Just throw some fucking apple grenades.

1148
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:56,539
Hold on.

1149
01:16:56,539 --> 01:16:58,539
There's multiple red swirls here.

1150
01:16:58,539 --> 01:17:01,550
There's multiple red swirls here.

1151
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:03,550
This is the real gear check here.

1152
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:10,140
Find out if I can be capable.

1153
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:12,140
Okay, high objects.

1154
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:17,710
Okay, high objects.

1155
01:17:17,710 --> 01:17:27,250
Got it.

1156
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:29,680
Drop the objects at...

1157
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,680
gemmy neutrons.

1158
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:34,239
Did it work? Yes.

1159
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:46,050
Come on.

1160
01:17:46,050 --> 01:17:58,579
Got it. Two?

1161
01:17:58,579 --> 01:18:03,699
You can't drop them on the ground?

1162
01:18:03,699 --> 01:18:05,699
Why?

1163
01:18:05,699 --> 01:18:07,699
These red swirls!

1164
01:18:07,699 --> 01:18:09,699
I'm going to seriously piss me off.

1165
01:18:09,699 --> 01:18:11,699
I'm just going to kill the red swirls.

1166
01:18:11,699 --> 01:18:15,789
Just kill them first.

1167
01:18:15,789 --> 01:18:19,760
There's one more over here.

1168
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:23,279
Now I'm not going to get attacked.

1169
01:18:23,279 --> 01:18:26,479
And after this, we'll move on to the next game.

1170
01:18:26,479 --> 01:18:28,479
And after this, we'll move on to the next game.

1171
01:18:28,479 --> 01:18:38,579
Thank you.

1172
01:18:38,579 --> 01:18:40,579
I would recommend you play...

1173
01:18:40,579 --> 01:18:43,779
That counts, right?

1174
01:18:43,779 --> 01:18:46,460
This one's actually fun.

1175
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:48,460
I recommend that you play gemmy neutron.

1176
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:50,460
This game's not good.

1177
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:52,460
This game's not good.

1178
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:54,640
Throws really infuriating little sequences at you for no reason like that.

1179
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,640
Throws really infuriating little sequences at you for no reason like that.

1180
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,640
That's unfair.

1181
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:03,949
This game's not very good.

1182
01:19:03,949 --> 01:19:08,300
Oh, Matt, because Matt.

1183
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:10,300
Matt, because Matt. Matt, because Matt.

1184
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:14,270
Matt, give me that right now.

1185
01:19:14,270 --> 01:19:22,829
Matt, give me that right now.

1186
01:19:22,829 --> 01:19:24,829
I would love, in fact, like an e-sports event.

1187
01:19:24,829 --> 01:19:26,829
I would love, in fact, like an e-sports event.

1188
01:19:26,829 --> 01:19:29,199
Or at a stadium somewhere.

1189
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:31,199
Don't you just wish you could hear that chant?

1190
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:33,199
It would be so funny.

1191
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:36,529
What a stupid chant that would be.

1192
01:19:36,529 --> 01:19:38,529
Oh, he missed a shot in lane!

1193
01:19:38,529 --> 01:19:40,529
That's too bad.

1194
01:19:40,529 --> 01:19:46,479
Where's fucking Ed?

1195
01:19:46,479 --> 01:19:48,479
Yeah, it looks like his...

1196
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:50,479
Who's a Bleak Legends fucking character?

1197
01:19:50,479 --> 01:19:55,279
Where's Ed?

1198
01:19:55,279 --> 01:20:14,159
Where's Ed?

1199
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:18,380
I fell through the earth.

1200
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:21,970
He was under the map.

1201
01:20:21,970 --> 01:20:23,970
Okay, well, let's try to go on these one more time.

1202
01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:30,500
Okay, well, let's try to go on these one more time.

1203
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:32,500
Like, imagine...

1204
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:34,670
Well, let's go over that again.

1205
01:20:34,670 --> 01:20:36,670
So, there's like a big e-sports event.

1206
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:39,359
And one of the teams, you know, a counter-strike or whatever.

1207
01:20:39,359 --> 01:20:41,359
And some guy misses a very important shot.

1208
01:20:41,359 --> 01:20:43,359
And you can see him visibly pissed off.

1209
01:20:43,359 --> 01:20:45,359
Commentators are like,

1210
01:20:45,359 --> 01:20:47,359
Man, he really is not happy about that.

1211
01:20:47,359 --> 01:20:49,359
Missing that last shot.

1212
01:20:49,359 --> 01:20:51,359
And the whole stadium is just like,

1213
01:20:51,359 --> 01:20:53,359
Mad because bad! Mad because bad!

1214
01:20:53,359 --> 01:20:58,159
Mad because bad!

1215
01:20:58,159 --> 01:21:03,729
I think that would be funny.

1216
01:21:03,729 --> 01:21:09,039
No, don't!

1217
01:21:09,039 --> 01:21:11,340
That would be so rude.

1218
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:13,340
I know.

1219
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:15,340
What's that again?

1220
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:17,340
Hold on, say that again?

1221
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:19,340
I'd like for you to say that in front of the whole class, please.

1222
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:21,340
Interesting. That would be what?

1223
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:24,029
What would that be?

1224
01:21:24,029 --> 01:21:26,029
Rude.

1225
01:21:26,029 --> 01:21:28,029
Very rude, wouldn't it?

1226
01:21:28,029 --> 01:21:30,529
Interesting.

1227
01:21:30,529 --> 01:21:46,340
You just fell right from my fucking trap.

1228
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:48,340
All of a sudden, it's rude!

1229
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:53,010
Whoa!

1230
01:21:53,010 --> 01:22:05,229
Alright, come on, come on.

1231
01:22:05,229 --> 01:22:11,869
I tried to catch it.

1232
01:22:11,869 --> 01:22:17,439
I can't take this anymore.

1233
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:24,500
Can I just like strategically give commands to say like,

1234
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:26,500
Hey, Ed, you stay over there and patrol.

1235
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:29,310
Next, next.

1236
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:31,310
Just wait, I gotta do this one more time.

1237
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:42,449
Hello, how are you?

1238
01:22:42,449 --> 01:22:45,140
Hello, how are you?

1239
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:50,449
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

1240
01:22:50,449 --> 01:22:57,409
Got it.

1241
01:22:57,409 --> 01:22:59,409
Look, Sarah left the table.

1242
01:22:59,409 --> 01:23:05,680
What am I supposed to do about that?

1243
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:17,390
What would that do for us?

1244
01:23:17,390 --> 01:23:23,199
Push Sarah.

1245
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:28,109
You sure?

1246
01:23:28,109 --> 01:23:30,109
I'm not sure that, I mean,

1247
01:23:30,109 --> 01:23:32,109
Push Sarah or Ehluhala Hey?

1248
01:23:32,109 --> 01:23:43,310
Which one do you think?

1249
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:45,310
No, that was good. That was a good idea too.

1250
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:47,310
Ehluhala Hey.

1251
01:23:47,310 --> 01:23:49,310
Thanks for the tip, guys.

1252
01:23:55,649 --> 01:23:58,779
Oh, jeez!

1253
01:24:00,779 --> 01:24:02,779
This game's driving me insane.

1254
01:24:02,779 --> 01:24:04,779
And chat insane.

1255
01:24:04,779 --> 01:24:06,779
Why is everybody driving insane?

1256
01:24:06,779 --> 01:24:11,260
You gonna go over the jump?

1257
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:19,649
Insane.

1258
01:24:19,649 --> 01:24:26,109
There's a reason why I wouldn't be invited

1259
01:24:26,109 --> 01:24:28,109
to an eSports event as a caster or something.

1260
01:24:28,109 --> 01:24:30,109
I would stand up and try to get them to do the Ed laugh.

1261
01:24:30,109 --> 01:24:32,109
I'd be like,

1262

for like five minutes.

1294
01:26:35,329 --> 01:26:37,500
That's what I would do with like an eSports event,

1295
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:39,500

1296
01:26:43,859 --> 01:26:45,859
Alright, I'm gonna shut up.

1297
01:26:45,859 --> 01:26:54,050

1827
03:12:14,090 --> 03:12:25,030

1831
03:12:58,079 --> 03:13:05,920
chopsticks what's the one that goes didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't

1832
03:13:05,920 --> 03:13:25,899

1833
03:13:25,899 --> 03:13:29,700
know I know this because this is the song that I learned how to play when I

1834
03:13:29,700 --> 03:13:39,000
was 11 that's a good answer but what does the survey say I can't even

1835
03:13:39,000 --> 03:13:42,840
imagine how that's not on there five answers remain that's the song that

1836
03:13:42,840 --> 03:13:48,940
yeah that's a song everyone learns to play everyone first song a kid

1842
03:15:07,540 --> 03:15:12,219
think of there are four answers still up on the board you've got two strikes

03:15:12,219 --> 03:15:18,799
you need to do this hot cross buns to name the first song a kid learns how

to play on the piano never gonna beat this game hot cross buns if it's not on

1845
03:15:45,940 --> 03:15:49,940
the board then you will lose control of the question cross buns is it on the

1846
03:15:49,940 --> 03:15:57,620
board but it would be there the other three blind mice to steal the points

trouble you're in trouble it's a little wonky but you know it's just

1975
03:43:31,770 --> 03:43:49,059
that was a lot of blood for one person that was like 30 people worth of love

1976
03:43:49,059 --> 03:44:10,739
destroy that thing manually moving a camera is kind of annoying it's

03:45:37,329 --> 03:45:58,139
already did that apparently not I thought I crushed it already author

1983
03:45:58,139 --> 03:46:08,250
Peter Benchley was thrown off the set after objecting to the climax okay

1984
03:46:08,250 --> 03:46:24,579
cool little tidbit I was shown the objective in the cutscene what do I do

1985
03:46:24,579 --> 03:46:27,659
well you've sat there for like a two straight minutes trying to break the

1986
03:46:27,659 --> 03:46:33,940
thing and I thought I broke it swim by the beach to attack swimmers to turn

1987
03:46:33,940 --> 03:46:40,739
smart camera off press R3 to enter first person press R3 button once more

1988
03:46:40,739 --> 03:46:52,629

1989
03:46:52,629 --> 03:47:08,500
drag them under without being spotted my god this is horrible he's

1994
03:48:25,760 --> 03:48:35,540

1997
03:49:47,340 --> 03:49:59,659

1998
03:49:59,659 --> 03:50:15,659
any people on this boat no get the seals wait what's this license plate

1999
03:50:15,700 --> 03:50:38,040
I got a thousand points for that eat eat eat eat eat she faces you actually level

2000
03:50:38,040 --> 03:50:57,659
up in this game I just jump up there I kind of can feel like I already blew

2001
03:50:57,659 --> 03:51:17,030
this though maybe not invisible wall well I'm not certain what I need to do

2002
03:51:17,030 --> 03:51:38,180
maybe I have to just restart holy shit okay that's cool

2003
03:51:38,219 --> 03:51:50,930
restore checkpoint maybe what is the latest checkpoint this is not the

2004
03:51:50,930 --> 03:52:31,760
beginning of the game is it destroy the peers okay she's still live this is

2005
03:52:31,760 --> 03:52:37,489
definitely one of those games that had a set of mature rating

2006
03:52:37,489 --> 03:53:05,860
that guy on fire this is rated it's rated holy shit why'd you just come in

2007
03:53:06,620 --> 03:53:20,200
I actually don't really I don't like this game it's too much it's it's scary

2008
03:53:20,200 --> 03:53:43,209
the underwater screams sounds so horrible now now you fuck it's just

2009
03:53:43,209 --> 03:54:03,190
not nice I need a better camera that was a first person it's easier so now

2010
03:54:03,190 --> 03:54:30,620
what's left just destroy more of the pier fuck this restaurant apparently

2011
03:54:30,620 --> 03:55:06,399
yeah destroy the whole building wait this person dead I think so see this

2012
03:55:06,399 --> 03:55:14,100
glowing red objects something I need to do to destroy them specifically just

2013
03:55:14,100 --> 03:55:32,079
take on the supports there it goes destroy the inflatable rafts

2014
03:55:32,079 --> 03:55:40,139
walking towards the shark is probably not the best idea

and we'll soon have the shark tracked and captured with the use of our

2130
04:40:16,360 --> 04:40:21,659
Aurora to research vessel say what you want but mr. mayor we have too

2131
04:40:21,659 --> 04:40:25,459
much invested to be careless until the beast is captured or better yet

2154
04:44:43,740 --> 04:44:47,180
underwater seaseeker machines are having a dramatic effect on the local

2155
04:44:47,180 --> 04:44:50,619
shark population it's causing them to approach human settlements and to

2156
04:44:50,619 --> 04:44:53,580
become increasingly more violent listen Brody I don't know what they play

foundations he laid decades of criminality have been reversed organized

2248
05:09:26,330 --> 05:09:31,930
crime is in retreat but we can do much more closer cooperation between the ACN

2249
05:09:31,930 --> 05:09:36,490
and biotech will allow ever greater control over criminals suspects and

2250
05:09:36,490 --> 05:09:40,290
those thinking criminal you just save a lot of money by doing full motion

2251
05:09:40,290 --> 05:09:45,290
cutscenes is only just beginning like live cutscenes meanwhile the bait still

2252
05:09:45,290 --> 05:09:49,849

informed us that Anna has been working on something referred to only as the

2468
05:50:36,880 --> 05:50:41,240
machine before being compromised he made a successful dead drop inside

2469
05:50:41,240 --> 05:50:47,340
casino operate turned on again from one of his mansions you're saying

2470
05:50:47,340 --> 05:50:51,360
Sarkin Anna are working together that's what you need to find out you

2471
05:50:51,360 --> 05:50:54,560
and Dixon will be infiltrating the casino we've already established your

2472
05:50:54,560 --> 05:50:58,720
alias as a new waitress and I'll be posing as a player on the casino floor

2473
05:50:58,720 --> 05:51:06,040
because you know blackjack poker back all right after you make contact with

2474
05:51:06,040 --> 05:51:11,080
me we can stay in audio-visual contact there's two things you have to do in

2475
05:51:11,080 --> 05:51:15,240
the casino if you get too close to Sarkin only max bet but we can tag

2476
05:51:15,240 --> 05:51:19,319
his going with five thousand dollars and put five thousand dollars on one

2477
05:51:19,319 --> 05:51:22,720
hand that will allow us to track if you win once you do that then you can

2478
05:51:22,720 --> 05:51:26,520
keep playing with the five thousand and put the other five thousand in the bank

2479
05:51:26,520 --> 05:51:29,599
and then if what if you lose just go home because you know that's what he's

2480
05:51:29,599 --> 05:51:33,560
gonna say it'll probably is what he said I talked over as well as what Sarkin

2481
05:51:33,560 --> 05:51:38,080
Anna are up to when you find the disk bring it back to CIA for analysis

2597
06:15:26,159 --> 06:15:29,319
this weapons plant from the computer hard drive when you hacked it it's

2598

06:20:24,319 --> 06:20:30,400
why I don't know did my blood like I have to make but I guess I have to

2618
06:20:30,400 --> 06:20:38,939
do like the streamer joke I have to it's a part of my DNA I didn't even want

2619
06:20:38,939 --> 06:21:12,419
to do that I thought I could jump all right we're good I'm right here it's

2620
06:21:12,419 --> 06:21:32,150
not that far away being a streamers in a phase mom it's in my DNA what I am

2621
06:21:32,150 --> 06:21:35,860
a goddamn streamer all right watch I'm gonna do it again

2622
06:21:35,860 --> 06:21:55,419
where's my prompt to go down the ladder why wouldn't I just use the

2623
06:21:55,419 --> 06:22:07,450
ladder just use the ladder she's the ladder is very clear ladder I fell

2624
06:22:07,450 --> 06:22:38,000
very fast but I still made it so now I gotta go something about a weapons

2625
06:22:38,000 --> 06:22:56,380
something about weapons now there are guns just been introduced play freedom

2626
06:22:56,380 --> 06:23:02,159
fighters I'm gonna play that tomorrow we start with clock tower 3 tomorrow

2627
06:23:02,159 --> 06:23:10,409
Sydney there's a lot of guards on patrol down here to take this guy out

2628
06:23:10,409 --> 06:23:16,709
with your stealth attack otherwise you'll alert the whole crowd use

2629
06:23:16,709 --> 06:23:33,319
enhanced division I hate this enhanced this is this is awful vision how do

2630
06:23:33,319 --> 06:23:59,419
you stealth attack get the gun get the gun what did you throw it down give me

2631
06:23:59,419 --> 06:24:27,110
the gun shoot him she's never used a gun before

2632
06:24:27,110 --> 06:24:47,650
just on the face three times I didn't take off the vision thing who's left

2633
06:24:47,650 --> 06:25:02,810
one more they were good right this is a Charlie's Angels video game not

2634
06:25:02,810 --> 06:25:16,130
quite you ate a pop tart today it was gross what kind of pop tart did

2635
06:25:16,130 --> 06:25:19,490
you eat if it wasn't a s'mores pop tart then you made the wrong decision

2636
06:25:19,490 --> 06:25:25,380
is there another game after this or is this probably the last one it's probably

2637
06:25:25,380 --> 06:25:33,669
the last one it's getting late and go for those cameras we'll pick it up

2638
06:25:33,669 --> 06:25:37,590
tomorrow if you use the razor prism now if you can find an open CCTV access

2639
06:25:37,590 --> 06:25:41,580
point to tap into the system we can see through their cameras don't see

2640
06:25:41,580 --> 06:25:52,049
what I can do just shoot them you're eating a s'mores pop tart right

2641
06:25:52,049 --> 06:25:56,400
now that's a great idea okay a safe place to use the razor

2642
06:25:56,400 --> 06:26:06,580
prism looks pretty safe you don't want to vape in public you want to

2643
06:26:06,659 --> 06:27:11,540
hide hello what the fuck got it nice backflip stunt man okay now what safe

no pokemons is too what's going on my neck there

2708
06:36:52,970 --> 06:36:57,500
do you see that it was like it was like my head was on the wrong angle

now this is okay that's better now I look

2711
06:37:14,919 --> 06:37:19,459

2712
06:37:19,459 --> 06:37:32,700
fucking hate cameras uh but not the pokemon is is interesting but

2713
06:37:32,700 --> 06:37:36,459
I don't think it's a good stream experience for me I would

2714
06:37:36,459 --> 06:37:39,020
probably get bored and it's not because pokemon's a boring game it's

2715
06:37:39,020 --> 06:37:44,060
because I get bored easily with games that are slow burns like that

2716
06:37:44,060 --> 06:37:48,220
walking around in the dirt and leaves and picking up new animals like I

2717

and now that he's streaming live on twitch more on that later

2954
07:02:37,349 --> 07:02:41,860
you can't get enough of him so you of course joined his discord

2955
07:02:41,860 --> 07:02:45,459
navigating through the channels you may go straight to the reason you

2956
07:02:45,459 --> 07:02:48,740
joined recommendations where you can suggest that germa

2957
07:02:48,740 --> 07:02:52,740
play your favorite game or do something in person for a stream however

2958
07:02:52,740 --> 07:02:57,380
it's more likely that you'll be enticed by the channel referred to as general

2959
07:02:57,380 --> 07:03:01,540
you click on it and are greeted with an ongoing discussion about why or why

2960
07:03:01,540 --> 07:03:05,700
not we bows people who watch anime essentially are

2961
07:03:05,700 --> 07:03:10,540
degenerates one and in an instant they're talking about snow

2962
07:03:10,540 --> 07:03:14,459
although you may not agree with some or perhaps even most of the users

2963
07:03:14,459 --> 07:03:18,060
there is one thing that everyone in that community has in common

2964
07:03:18,139 --> 07:03:21,180
as community moderator noah effectator states

2965
07:03:21,180 --> 07:03:26,139
that's the thing germa's discourse community is populated not necessarily

2966
07:03:26,139 --> 07:03:29,979
by like-minded individuals but by people who all have one thing

2967
07:03:29,979 --> 07:03:32,779
in common they have a desire to watch this one

2968
07:03:32,779 --> 07:03:36,619
man entertain thousands of people by doing whatever he feels like doing

2969
07:03:36,619 --> 07:03:40,970
don't look at my armpit hair two one discord user laser two noah

2970
07:03:40,970 --> 07:03:44,569
interviewed by joey provost wait what what is this

2971
07:03:44,569 --> 07:03:47,290
why are we getting thousand and nineteen three noah

2972
07:03:47,290 --> 07:03:51,689
interviewed by joey provost on discord oh this is uh god damn it this is like

2973
07:03:51,689 --> 07:03:55,290
thousand and nineteen by now it's important to recognize what a

2974
07:03:55,290 --> 07:03:59,619
moderator does exactly a moderator makes sure that the people

2975
07:03:59,619 --> 07:04:04,419
springtime i'm gonna get cleaned up all right i clean it up in the spring

2976
07:04:04,419 --> 07:04:08,419
so stop it follow moderators can mute people

2977
07:04:08,419 --> 07:04:13,130
ban them and do several other things three so it goes without saying that

2978
07:04:13,130 --> 07:04:18,580
an expert of the community which linguist john swales attests to

2979
07:04:18,580 --> 07:04:22,900
being vital to a discourse community that it has changing memberships for

2980
07:04:22,900 --> 07:04:26,740
would definitely be a moderator as moderator grump clump of three

2981
07:04:26,740 --> 07:04:29,860
years confirms moderators are chosen if they are

2982
07:04:29,860 --> 07:04:33,619
rational and highly involved members of the community that prove themselves to

2983
07:04:33,619 --> 07:04:37,700
be upstanding people that can enforce rules and keep a level head five this

2984
07:04:37,700 --> 07:04:40,979
expertise is proven to be beneficial to the community

2985
07:04:40,979 --> 07:04:46,180
as on germa's twitch.tv twitch is a platform where people can

2986
07:04:46,180 --> 07:04:49,939
stream themselves playing video games card games

2987
07:04:49,939 --> 07:04:55,619
skits drawing whatever you can imagine and includes with that stream the

2988
07:04:55,619 --> 07:04:59,220
live chat in which any user can say something to the streamer or other

2989
07:04:59,220 --> 07:05:03,299
users in the chat channel what is known as live chat goes

2990
07:05:03,299 --> 07:05:07,139
by incredibly fast and it can be incomprehensibly difficult

2991
07:05:07,139 --> 07:05:11,000
to moderate chat when the messages scroll by so quickly

2992
07:05:11,000 --> 07:05:15,560
what helps this is discord which the discourse community utilizes alongside

2993
07:05:15,560 --> 07:05:21,180
twitch force wales john the concept of discourse community

2994
07:05:21,180 --> 07:05:25,909
genre analysis english in academic and research settings

2995
07:05:25,909 --> 07:05:32,150
boston cambridge up 1995 grump clump interviewed by joey provost on

2996
07:05:32,150 --> 07:05:36,630
discord on february 15 2019 what is

2997
07:05:36,630 --> 07:05:40,549
discord anyway discord is an application that

2998
07:05:40,549 --> 07:05:44,709
people can use in order to communicate whether that be through images what is

2999
07:05:44,709 --> 07:05:49,349
discord anyways or text chat germa's discord community is one

3000
07:05:49,349 --> 07:05:52,630
that boasts 16 600 and that's a mess of shit

3001
07:05:52,630 --> 07:05:55,830
there's a lot of people you may think that it is a disaster to communicate

3002
07:05:55,830 --> 07:05:59,830
in a server that large only 30 to 50 people will be talking at

3003
07:05:59,830 --> 07:06:03,509
the same time even less in the same channel

3004
07:06:03,509 --> 07:06:08,169
so why even bother with the discord when twitch has its own chat already

3005
07:06:08,169 --> 07:06:12,330
noah a moderator of both germa's discord and twitch channel for about a

3006
07:06:12,330 --> 07:06:15,610
year and a half found true that's an accident him on the

3007
07:06:15,610 --> 07:06:18,970
discord that's not true interviewees answers

3008
07:06:18,970 --> 07:06:22,650
this question twitch is all live the chat goes by

3009
07:06:22,650 --> 07:06:26,650
extremely fast due to the fast nature of live streams

3010
07:06:26,650 --> 07:06:30,569
and the fact that thousands of people are watching at any given point

3011
07:06:30,569 --> 07:06:35,029
mob mentality can come through sometimes

3012
07:06:35,029 --> 07:06:39,830
in comparison to the discord which is basically just a slower chat room

3013
07:06:39,830 --> 07:06:43,509
six so it seems that the discord is there for a more reliable method of

3014
07:06:43,509 --> 07:06:47,750
communication than live chat which disappears after a set time

3015
07:06:47,750 --> 07:06:52,389
grump clump clarifies this observation i don't really consider this community

3016
07:06:52,389 --> 07:06:55,509
to have a set goal other than to have a place to enjoy

3017
07:06:55,509 --> 07:06:59,990
yourself seven so then the discord is used in different ways by everybody

3018
07:06:59,990 --> 07:07:03,669
and nobody really seems to have a concise answer to the question of what

3019
07:07:03,669 --> 07:07:08,069
the purpose of the community is but as swale states the goal nobody

3020
07:07:08,069 --> 07:07:15,590
knows may not be explicitly stated note that other terminology nine grump

3021
07:07:15,590 --> 07:07:19,509
clump interviewed by joey six noah interviewed

3022
07:07:19,509 --> 07:07:22,470
by joey what's going on here wait why is it doing this can come

3023
07:07:22,470 --> 07:07:25,750
through sometimes in comparison to the discord which is

3024
07:07:25,750 --> 07:07:30,549
basically just a slower chat room six so it seems that the discord is

3025
07:07:30,549 --> 07:07:33,990
there for a more reliable method of communication than live chat which

3026
07:07:33,990 --> 07:07:38,150
disappears after a set time grump clump clarifies this

3027
07:07:38,229 --> 07:07:42,709
observation i don't really consider this community to have a set goal

3028
07:07:42,709 --> 07:07:46,470
other than to have a place to enjoy yourself seven so then the discord is

3029
07:07:46,470 --> 07:07:50,549
used in different ways by everybody and nobody really seems to have a

3030
07:07:50,549 --> 07:07:54,470
concise answer to the question of what the purpose of the community is

3031
07:07:54,470 --> 07:07:59,509
but as swale states the goals of a discourse may not be explicitly stated

3032
07:07:59,509 --> 07:08:02,950
however it still is a discourse community if it adheres to the other

3033
07:08:02,950 --> 07:08:06,009
five characteristics eight but again the

3034
07:08:06,009 --> 07:08:09,610
common factor in all of this is the adoration of germa which unites the

3035
07:08:09,610 --> 07:08:14,250
discourse community six noah interviewed by joey provost

3036
07:08:14,250 --> 07:08:21,619
on discord on february 15 2000 mentality nine why mentality

3037
07:08:21,619 --> 07:08:27,700
12 grump clump the discord members of the community also create genre by

3038
07:08:27,700 --> 07:08:32,500
participating in the live chat and also by influencing germa as he

3039
07:08:32,500 --> 07:08:37,619
frequently will read the chat the live chat grump clump says is

3040
07:08:37,619 --> 07:08:41,880
the majority of the community they are the loudest and have the strongest

3041
07:08:41,880 --> 07:08:45,819
herd mentality nine further because of the common

3042
07:08:45,819 --> 07:08:50,220
trait that they all like watching germa chat also seems to focus a lot on

3043
07:08:50,220 --> 07:08:53,819
trying to send a message to germa in the form of chat in order for germa

3044
07:08:53,819 --> 07:08:56,700
to read it which appears to be easily overwhelming

3045
07:08:56,700 --> 07:09:00,220
for the moderators to be able to moderate that flow of text

3046
07:09:00,220 --> 07:09:04,220
however new member of three months dr hunkalicious

3047
07:09:04,220 --> 07:09:08,220
criticrat equals three tells us how germa doesn't use the discord often

3048
07:09:08,220 --> 07:09:12,380
enough and rarely posts on twitter chat is where a lot of content comes

3049
07:09:12,380 --> 07:09:16,150
from germa also chat has a powerful influence on the

3050
07:09:16,150 --> 07:09:19,669
community and it's where a lot of terms and culture of the community is

3051
07:09:19,669 --> 07:09:22,659
formed and so it seems then that both the

3052
07:09:22,659 --> 07:09:25,540
discord and twitch chat are essential to the community

3053
07:09:25,540 --> 07:09:28,740
the pretty gap also appears that in this community

3054
07:09:28,740 --> 07:09:32,340
the characteristics of intercommunication participation

3055
07:09:32,340 --> 07:09:35,939
and genre which are vital to a discourse community 11 are all

3056
07:09:36,020 --> 07:09:39,380
interconnected as participation cause genre

3057
07:09:39,380 --> 07:09:43,299
genre causes participation as well as intercommunication

3058
07:09:43,299 --> 07:09:46,900
and intercommunication causes participation

3059
07:09:46,900 --> 07:09:50,580
the method and the way in which go about communicating is unique

3060
07:09:50,580 --> 07:09:54,819
to say the least nine grump clump interviewed by joey

3061

3063
07:10:03,509 --> 07:10:07,430
can always be asked on the discord for a hasty thorough response

3064
07:10:07,430 --> 07:10:10,709
12 grump clump interviewed by joey no no no what about this part

take a little while yeah i don't know where this came from

3282
07:34:46,540 --> 07:34:52,220
it came from right now uh we're funny there's no family few we

3283
07:34:52,220 --> 07:34:55,099
play it all the time it's like what it it's a staple on the

3284
07:34:55,099 --> 07:34:58,659
channel we play it like once every few months

3285
07:34:58,659 --> 07:35:03,380
actually do a family feud where the community has asked questions

3286
07:35:03,380 --> 07:35:07,689
and people have surveyed and do a full

3287
07:35:07,689 --> 07:35:11,529
like couple hour long family feud based on

3288
07:35:11,529 --> 07:35:15,880
me needing to figure out what people in the community had said

3289
07:35:15,880 --> 07:35:28,279
like a real life family few get in the studio

3290
