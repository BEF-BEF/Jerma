1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:13,429
Afternoon, everybody. I'll be on a swell a couple of days. Don't forget about the pre-stream bits.

2
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:25,929
Holy shit, don't... uh, yeah, don't forget about those. Oh my god. We... we... I just turned it on.

3
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:41,579
Wait, you... this is before the stream even went on. Uh, Fat Bossant. Fat Bossant. Fat Bossient.

4
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,549
I don't know, I'm saying your name like it's a croissant. Uh, thank you for the 50 dollars.

5
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:58,020
50 bucks from Fat Bossant. RIP January 23, 2019 at 7 43 p.m. The YouTube link here, let's just make

6
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:16,420
sure. Let's see what we're getting into here. All right, where even is that plane? Is this even

7
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:30,260
plane? I don't like this. So is that Eastern time? Does it count if I go back in time like

8
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:38,310
I did? Wednesday, January 23, at 7 43 p.m. But that could be local time.

9
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:52,969
Fate knows you moved any time zone other than EST. Fate predicted that you would move. Well,

10
00:01:52,969 --> 00:02:00,840
whatever. Even if it is Eastern. Let's go by the original fate. That would mean that at 4...

11
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:09,930
at 4 43 tomorrow, I'm gonna be in this chair with my room duct taped. And I'm gonna be...

12
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:18,490
I had quite the Amazon order. Uh, if Amazon like wanted to like take a look at people

13
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:25,909
what they were buying. I bought like a hockey mask, duct tape, and like hockey pads.

14
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:30,919
Sometimes I look at my fucking orders that I put through and I go, my god, what am I doing?

15
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:47,639
I'm like a murderer. Like Jason. When do you think he gets those masks? He has an Amazon

16
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:58,039
subscription order that comes in like once or twice a month. Why are you playing hockey

17
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:06,699
in Vegas? Vegas has got a good hockey team. They just got one. The Golden Knights. But

18
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:15,740
regardless, thank you so much to Fat Bossiant for 5,000 bits before the stream even turned on.

19
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:25,620
The fact that you do just give that. Thanks a lot. Really. Thank you so fucking much for 50

20
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:40,039
dollars. And then P337R for 25 dollars. Thank you so much Peter for the 25 bucks. And then

21
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:47,180
Fat Bossiant said that they demand Tim Machine 9 for the next Jerma Rumble. And he's like,

22
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,020
he's traveling all over the world in different time periods. So he might show up. He might

23
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:57,819
not. Anyways, we're gonna play a game called, why don't we just switch to it so you know what

24
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:04,550
it is, Lifeline. This game is for PlayStation 2. It uses the PlayStation 2 microphone,

25
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:10,409
which is, was actually kind of hard to track down because there's only like two mics

26
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:15,770
that work with this game. And I couldn't really find an original PlayStation 2 one.

27
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,250
And I didn't really want an original PlayStation 2 one because I don't think it's that high

28
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:25,209
quality. It would probably misunderstand everything I was saying. So I had to get a,

29
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:32,379
an old Logitech PS2 headset and I tested it. It works. I know you're not seeing any

30
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:40,660
audio right now, but what's a bet. Thanks to the five community subs and Herbert,

31
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:47,079
both of you, five community subs, 10 in total here. You guys are fucking awesome. Yeah,

32
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,560
the audio is not on because you guys are gonna have to play a little game here

33
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:57,589
called capturing the PlayStation 2 through a little box from little box to capture card,

34
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:02,389
capture card to PC. There's going to be like a thousand milliseconds of audio delay.

35
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:06,069
So we're going to do a Dora the fucking Explorer here in the beginning where you

36
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:12,180
guys are going to help me turn and fix this shit. So for a second I thought it

37
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:19,110
didn't have a controller. I was like, well, that ruined everything. No, I got one right here.

38
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,829
So the, this is lifeline. It's a game. You, I don't even need a controller

39
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:28,810
because the whole game is used with your voice. Every single thing in the game. It's a voice

40
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:36,149
command voice activated game and it's like an action shooter and we're going to try to beat

41
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:43,610
the whole game. No, we're not. You might see me here for like five hours. I can't promise

42
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:51,079
that anyways. I'm ready to go. Let's go ahead and get started. Let me just get this

43
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:59,060
on. God, last time I wore a headset like this was like three months ago because I moved and I

44
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:05,000
had to get a similar one, but this is only for the PlayStation 2. Let's get an audio sync in

45
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,970
here before we do anything else. So here comes the audio and you guys are going to have

46
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:19,019
the fun job. I gotta make sure it's in the right spot. Okay. So let's do a little audio

47
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:23,259
sync test here. I'm going to press the start button. Not you. Hold on. Okay. Ready?

48
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:31,240
So how does that sound? You should be hearing a little like did it and did it in every time

49
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:39,319
it's selected. It's okay. That's good. All right. Now we're going to do a thing where I'm matching

50
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:46,060
my voice to it. Oh my God. Somebody's to give a hundred dollars. It's a, this is almost

51
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,899
two hundred dollars and I haven't even done anything. I just turned on a stream. Oh my

52
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:58,980
goodness. Vladimir. Vladimir, bad man. Thanks for the hundred dollars. 10,000 bits. Thank you.

53
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,750
I'm going to say thanks for the years of quality content, Jerma. Shame about your untimely death

54
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:10,860
tomorrow. I'll be just fine. I got a fat suit. I got hockey pads. I'm patting myself and I'm

55
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,420
going to sit here and we're going to just fucking read nursery rhymes or something.

56
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:23,110
I, I, I'll be just fine. I'll buy boxing gloves. But holy shit, Vladimir. Thank you

57
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:30,069
for the extreme amount of money. All of the, all of you guys. My God. All right, here we go.

58
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:40,100
Ready? One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. We lined up.

59
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:54,550
Almost good. Sounds fine. There's a tiny delay. All right. So you, is it my voice first or

60
00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:08,629
is it game audio first? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. So my voice is first. So it's like,

61
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:23,610
let me, let me, this fixes it. See if it's okay. You ready? Oh my God. Oh no,

62
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:28,410
that's just like it's stream labs. I don't know why it takes like five minutes to show on screen

63
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:35,690
sometimes. Holy shit. I was about to lose my mind. All right. Ready? One, two, three, four.

64
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:40,730
One, two, three, four. One, two. Oh yeah. This game's gotta be fun. Oh yeah. This game's

65
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:47,529
gotta be fun. Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good. All right. We're going.

66
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:52,409
New game. This is lifeline PlayStation two. Let's get the fuck going. What do you say?

67
00:08:53,210 --> 00:09:04,700
New game. Show your face. No, I'm wicked ugly. I'm too ugly today. I've been feeling kind of

68
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:11,559
ill lately. They're going to hear me say this. I don't want them to hear me say this.

69
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:19,940
Two to three centimeters from your mouth. Two to three centimeters from my mouth it is.

70
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,940
The position of the microphone is crucial. This is crucial.

71
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:34,970
Dual shock two.

72
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:46,009
All right. Circle when speaking. Hold it down. You got it.

73
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:59,370
Okay. Speak when talk now appears. Say hello. Hello. Hello. Microphone done. I'm just kidding.

74
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:20,340
Hello. Hello. PlayStation. Lifeline. Oh, you get points for how good you say it.

75
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:25,620
I'm gonna do just fine. I'm gonna put on my like used car salesman voice

76
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,620
or my telemarketer voice. I'm gonna get. Just wait.

77
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:49,059
Give an order to the character. Walk. I can.

78
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,299
Run. That's not great.

79
00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:06,169
Okay. Stop. How many tiers of good pronunciation are there?

80
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:20,919
Go to the table. I'm gonna try as hard as I can.

81
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:37,220
Look at the bottle. What? Fuck you. Turned out to be one. Like this names of objects

82
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,940
are revealed when instructions are given successfully. If you are not sure of the

83
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:46,659
name of an object, saying its dominant color or basic shape may work instead.

84
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:51,460
In this case, saying green bottle is better for recognition than simply saying

85
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,539
bottle. Once the name is revealed, you can give more specific instructions.

86
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:14,389
Check the wine. Why am I doing these so bad? Am I not saying it good enough? Do it faster.

87
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:18,809
Seems like nothing is unusual about the wine. When you find anything remotely curious,

88
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:22,730
it's best to check the item carefully. Additionally, certain objects can be

89
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:27,289
combined with various verbs when you give instructions. Drink the wine. Get the wine.

90
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:45,669
Oh god. Go back. I'm like, this is like an English lesson.

91
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:54,440
Remember when the enemy is detected, we will automatically move to the scene of battle.

92
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:00,039
So is it turn based or is it? Carefully observe the enemy while giving commands.

93
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:03,000
This thing doesn't have a head to stomach or a mouth. It's a shoe.

94
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,679
Carefully observe the shoe while getting attacked. Let's try making an actual attack.

95
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:27,379
Shoot. Jumped over it. Move left. Shoot head. I was waiting. It didn't do anything. Dodge.

96
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:44,970
This is going to be fun. Okay. Dodge and shoot. Should I do my like anime voice actor voice?

97
00:13:44,970 --> 00:14:02,710
Is that better? It might be. Flee and recover. Shoot, shoot, shoot. Did I get them?

98
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,159
When multiple enemies appear, targeting can be prioritized with number one,

99
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:27,019
number two, et cetera. Number two. Number one. Okay. Let's shoot head. Shoot mouth.

100
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:58,950
Yeah. Yeah. Head shoot. Reload. Okay. How do I know what a weak spot is? Stomach. Stomach.

101
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:08,340
You should be aware of when giving commands. Why do I look like this?

102
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:15,820
Pay close attention to the following points. Pay attention to this because this is important

103
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:23,590
shit because I'm going to mess up a ton of these pronunciations. Use proper timing

104
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:29,429
when pressing and releasing the microphone button. Okay. Use the proper point volume.

105
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:40,860
Okay. Use clear pronunciation. This is just, this is a job interview instructions.

106
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,059
Make sure when you're at your interview, you talk with the proper voice volume.

107
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:56,039
Don't intimidate the interviewer. This concludes the tutorial. It does. All right. Let's go.

108
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:12,330
Let's go. Now we begin our tale. Let's go. Always immediately intimidate the interviewer

109
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:19,029
with a loud voice. Do your best Jim Carrey impression when you open the door to the

110
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:27,129
position. There's no subtitles. Not only was he one of the era's finest medical minds,

111
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:39,220
he also made contributions in alchemy, astrology, astronomy, and mysticism. When he was in his

112
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:46,580
thirties, he was said to have incredible healing abilities. That prompted him to adopt the name

113
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:55,820
of Perichelsus, superseding Kelsus, the famed doctor of ancient times. In his later years,

114
00:16:56,379 --> 00:17:02,779
he is said to have gone on a journey of healing, visiting the terminally ill and

115
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:06,579
curing them. I'm not doing this voice.

116
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,240
It just pops up on screen. Bad. The narrator's like, what the fuck are you talking about?

117
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:40,039
That was perfect pronunciation. That was, was that actually Orson Welles? That was, this is

118
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:55,990
1998. No, this is 2004 guys. Pretty nice graphics. December 24th, 2029, 10 PM. That's

119
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:02,180
your new death date, Jeremy. Yeah, this is PlayStation 2 guys. Give it a little bit of

120
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:24,390
slack. It's PlayStation 2 being upscaled to like 720p or like 1080 nearly. Doesn't look that bad.

121
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:32,140
No, it doesn't. I mean, this little device that I have is pretty much works great.

122
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:44,069
I really don't know. I don't appreciate the long like Star Wars pause silence thing.

123
00:18:45,029 --> 00:19:03,720
It was the same scene from a different angle. Is this the monitor room? Here we go. My

124
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,779
first command. Open. No, I'm not going to say that. That's so, that's too easy. That's

125
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:12,059
a very low hanging fruit. I'm not going to grab it. I'm reaching for the fucking

126
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:28,839
coconut that's up there. I'm not reaching for the banana. A wound. I can't read that.

127
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:30,920
Surveillance camera recording canceled.

128
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,180
Okay, I did that voice. That's, that's a much better example.

129
00:19:55,029 --> 00:20:01,509
Today. So this occasion is extra meaningful for me. Today we mark the first day to the end

130
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:08,069
of our long running. That's me and Naomi. We were lucky to be invited to the space station

131
00:20:08,069 --> 00:20:19,589
hotel. Cheers. Good evening. Don't drink it. Do you like a cocktail? No. How do I say no?

132
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:36,980
No, thank you. I don't drink. Naomi. Yeah. Why is she doing this?

133
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:41,420
But the government has been promising economic relief.

134
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,539
Why are you just watching unedited video footage of when you were here?

135
00:20:45,339 --> 00:20:50,279
You're probably looking for something. Somebody, somebody did something bad.

136
00:20:51,079 --> 00:21:03,460
This is when the aliens come in. The whole room shook violently and something crashed the party.

137
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:33,430
Red eyes. Insatiable hunger. They started eating guests. I heard it in my eyes. And then

138
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:43,269
I passed out. I can't believe we're spending Christmas in space. Thank you.

139
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:50,740
Oh, is that, is that some like exposition to tell us that that

140
00:21:51,380 --> 00:22:08,019
separated from my beloved girlfriend? I can't even see. Okay, this is the security room.

141
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:15,910
I understand what this game is. Can anyone come in please?

142
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:24,809
I'm the security officer giving instructions. I'm just like the fat guy sitting there at

143
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:41,319
security detail. Hello. Hey. You don't sound like the regular guy.

144
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:49,400
Anyway, it doesn't matter who you listen. Will you please undo the lock?

145
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:57,849
I mean, you didn't say please. Okay. Understood. Please hurry.

146
00:22:57,849 --> 00:23:02,569
Holy shit. What a fucking unbelievable game. This game. When did this game come up?

147
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:08,259
There's no way that just happened. Please disengage the lock on the store.

148
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:13,660
Uh, hold on a minute. I'm just currently processing some information here.

149
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:19,900
We can talk after I get out of here. Please disengage the lock door panel. Disengage. If you

150
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:25,799
press the button, you'll access the door panel and the button again. That will open the

151
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:33,690
panel for controlling. Oh, it's supposed to be a voice game. Operate to disengage the

152
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:38,009
detaining cell door lock to operate. Open the control panel. Disengage the lock on the store.

153
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:53,430
The lock is open. Saved at last. A real headcase security guard locked me up in there for over an

154
00:23:53,430 --> 00:24:05,079
hour. Geez. I didn't know what was going to happen. So what's your story? Are you trapped

155
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:09,480
inside that monitor room? So we share the same dilemma. Oh, I wish I could have told

156
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:23,539
my story. And now? I would have talked her ear off. Uh, YDNA 10 community subs right now.

157
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:36,259
Thank you. It's not in here. 10 community subs. A lot of money. Thanks a lot. Huge thanks.

158
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:45,640
What are you looking for? I'm positive that it's here in this room. What is in the room?

159
00:24:52,339 --> 00:24:59,059
It's locked. I'll take care of this. Stand back. Just like you ended the other one.

160
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:14,420
Yeah, I'm Superman. Look at how powerful I am. I can make red bars green and then

161
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:24,710
you can open them. Where are you going? Yeah, I can't. Yeah, I can't talk right now.

162
00:25:25,509 --> 00:25:34,890
Where'd you get the gun? Here it is. You just have that. I should take care of any monsters.

163
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:39,589
Look, I'm in a bit of a hurry. Just wait there to be rescued. If we're lucky,

164
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:44,650
we'll see each other soon. Until then. Uh, that's not gonna happen. You're gonna

165
00:25:44,650 --> 00:26:05,369
open this door and you're gonna need my help immediately. Get up. Okay, here we go.

166
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:38,539
Dodge right. Step back. Step back. Shoot right eye. Run left. Back. Shoot. Shoot left eye.

167
00:26:43,670 --> 00:27:04,869
Shoot left eye. Shoot mouth. Back. Back. Dodge roll. Okay. Shoot left eye.

168
00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:17,349
Shoot left eye. Shoot tail. Shoot tail. Shoot tail. Back. Run away.

169
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:34,700
Don't run away. Run away. Okay. Shoot middle eye. No, she did that on her own. Shoot middle eye.

170
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:54,519
Shoot middle eye. Back. Shoot mouth. Oh, shoot red eye. Back. Dodge left.

171
00:27:56,359 --> 00:28:10,420
Dodge left. Shoot red eye. Shoot. Shoot. Shoot. Shoot eye. Shoot red eye. Reload.

172
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:40,359
Shoot the sans eye. Shoot red eye. Shoot red eye. Don't put that, what are you doing?

173
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:44,900
That's a dangerously close place to put your, don't put your head there.

174
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:53,779
My god, you're gonna be a heart attack later. What the fuck?

175
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:59,380
There, weren't you? You were with the girl in the dark blue dress.

176
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:14,390
That girl you were with, what was her name? Frank. Fred. Wendy. Wrong. That wasn't her name.

177
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:19,509
Oh, it's on the tip of my tongue. She didn't want to tell me. Agatha. I'm talking about

178
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:25,670
your girlfriend. I got lots of girlfriends, so I mean. That can't be true. What's your

179
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:35,289
girlfriend's name? I don't, I don't remember her name. I don't remember. That can't be true.

180
00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:46,299
Come on, what's the name of that girl? I don't know. Nancy. Vicki. No, no, wrong name.

181
00:29:46,299 --> 00:29:53,660
Vicki? Vicki. No, no, wrong name. Your girlfriend's name. Sarah. Sarah? No, that's

182
00:29:54,380 --> 00:30:01,420
not it. Stacy. Stephanie. Wrong. It was three syllables. Jessica. Jessica. Wrong.

183
00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:08,619
It was three syllables. Jennifer. Jennifer? No, no, wrong name. Help me out here, lady.

184
00:30:08,619 --> 00:30:15,019
Come on, what's the name of that girl? Linda. Linda. Rhonda. No, that's not it.

185
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:20,220
It was three syllables. Come on, what's the name of that girl? Naomi.

186
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:28,309
Oh, and she. I wouldn't have got, we would have been there all day. I would have had to

187
00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:32,470
reset the game if I didn't get cheated in chat. Well, no wonder, and all that commotion.

188
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:38,069
Me, I don't even remember how I managed to get out of the restaurant. I'm worried about her.

189
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:43,660
She may be in need of help somewhere. I didn't, I don't, I didn't even know.

190
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:49,900
Listen, can I ask for your help? Before escaping from the station hotel, there's something that

191
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:55,539
I have to find. Can you help me out as an operator, like the way you did before?

192
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:03,269
In return, I'll find your Naomi along the way. So it's a deal? I can count on your help?

193
00:31:07,829 --> 00:31:17,559
SpongeBob meme. Punching over. Can I count on your help? You can call me Rio. Okay, glad

194
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:31,059
to meet you, operator. Are you ready? Oh, should have to say yes. I forgot. I did like

195
00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:39,509
do everything. I guess there's no need for formal introductions. Oh, yes. Well, that's

196
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:45,589
fine. I won't fail in my search. All right, let's shut down the stream. That's the worst

197
00:31:45,589 --> 00:31:51,190
joke. It was, it was a fake one. I was making a fake reference to a meme overuse thing.

198
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:55,829
Let's choose a password for ourselves. Oh, no. You don't know very much about this hotel,

199
00:31:55,829 --> 00:31:59,509
do you? I need a password. I bet there's lots of things that'll confuse you while

200
00:31:59,509 --> 00:32:05,190
we're searching. Like what should we be doing for instance? So in a situation like that,

201
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:13,349
let's see. Banana. Coconut. Say consultation. Consultation? If you say that, I'll explain

202
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:20,150
things to you. Okay? Try saying the word. This is just that movie with um. Say it please.

203
00:32:21,029 --> 00:32:27,589
Consultation. Yep, a consultation. With Tom Cruise. We have to go search the station

204
00:32:27,589 --> 00:32:30,470
hotel thoroughly after this. No, that's a fucking spoiler. We'll have to go everywhere.

205
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:35,670
I can't do movie and TV spoilers this stream. I intend to follow your instructions for

206
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:40,869
doing most things. But if your instructions are hard to understand, I'll get confused.

207
00:32:40,869 --> 00:32:44,390
For instance, if you were to say go over there, I'd be like, which way is there?

208
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:47,269
I'd be like. So if you want me to go somewhere, I want you to say its name.

209
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:55,099
For example, in this room, there are places like the lockers and the table.

210
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:58,460
Four fridges. You know how you can just play maps in the monitor room?

211
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:02,680
Direct me where you want to go by the name on the map.

212
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:12,660
Okay. Do you understand? Not really, but yes. Okay. The map that you just saw, you can access

213
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:17,059
and display it on your monitor. If there's anything else you don't understand, check the

214
00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:22,259
keyword list. That list records keywords and phrases that are extracted from our dialogue.

215
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:26,339
Not only that, the list already contains words in the operator's manual.

216
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:30,980
Of course, there are plenty of words that aren't on the list. Anyway,

217
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,980
how about giving me my first instruction? What should I do?

218
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:58,250
A lot of options here. Go to the bathroom. Yep. No, no, no. I don't mean like that.

219
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:05,049
That's not what I mean, guys. I mean, like I want to go into the bathroom.

220
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:24,340
She's currently walking around. She did it. Okay. Get a snack from the vending machine.

221
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:34,699
The vending machine. Okay. Bottom left vending machine receptacle.

222
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:47,320
These are the vending machines. Put hand in vending machine. Put hand in leftmost slot.

223
00:34:48,739 --> 00:35:01,289
If there is something, it would be good. Nope. Too bad. It's empty. Dispenser.

224
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:14,920
Put hand in right dispenser. There was nothing. I'm disappointed.

225
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:20,659
I see something in there. Put hand in dispenser slot number three.

226
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:32,789
Put hand in dispenser. Put hand in dispenser. Grab item in dispenser.

227
00:35:32,789 --> 00:35:45,210
Which dispenser do you mean? Put hand in first dispenser slot on the right.

228
00:35:46,179 --> 00:35:58,409
I've checked it earlier. That was enough. Put hand in second from the right dispenser slot.

229
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:08,010
I've checked it earlier. That was enough. Middle right dispenser. The dispenser?

230
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:15,719
I don't know what you mean. Put hand in middle right dispenser.

231
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:28,090
I've checked it earlier. That was enough. Check all dispensers.

232
00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:37,769
Which dispenser do you mean? Check third dispenser. Check third dispenser.

233
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:44,730
Which dispenser do you mean? Check currently selected dispenser.

234
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:54,119
Which dispenser do you mean? Check red dispenser. Which dispenser do you mean?

235
00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:04,099
Check red dispenser. Which dispenser do you mean? Check red dispenser three.

236
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:08,099
Which dispenser do you mean? There's an item in there that I have to get.

237
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:16,630
Red left. That's not going to work. Pilot guy, thanks for the five community subs.

238
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:28,280
Thank you. Just coming in right now. Left red. I've checked it earlier. That was enough.

239
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:33,510
Just do it without the mic. Those of you that are just joining the stream,

240
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:42,550
I cannot move. It's only voice commands only. Check the third slot. It only says juice.

241
00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:50,630
Everything sold out except for prune juice. Consultation. Wait a second. Can that

242
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:57,829
consultation wait? Let's check this first. No, I can't even get tech support. I'm on hold right

243
00:37:57,829 --> 00:38:19,139
now. Okay, I'm going to try this again. Grab. You're too vague. I don't know what you mean.

244
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:28,519
Check dispenser slot three. Which dispenser do you mean? Look at right dispenser.

245
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:40,539
I've checked it earlier. That was enough. Check second from the right dispenser.

246
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:53,989
I've checked it earlier. That was enough. The item's right here. Just dispenser three.

247
00:38:54,710 --> 00:39:03,719
I've said every single one of these. Check dispenser three. Which dispenser do you mean?

248
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:18,730
That's what happens. Right vending machine. These are the vending machines. Grab item red

249
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:23,289
from left. No, that's like I got hit the head with a hammer and just said five random words.

250
00:39:28,179 --> 00:39:45,179
Pick up item from dispenser. I've checked it earlier. That was enough. I can't select them

251
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:54,469
either. There's an item in here. She needs to get this. There is an item in the dispenser

252
00:39:54,469 --> 00:40:16,230
on the right. No response. Germa, your right is her left. No, it isn't. What? Check second

253
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:23,590
dispenser from the right. There's something in here. Okay, I said that like 15 times.

254
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:41,750
Back up. Pardon me? Do what to what? Sure you did. I did. I said it like five, 10 times.

255
00:40:42,789 --> 00:40:53,050
Leave. What is it? Leave. Leave the room? Okay. No. No, stop. Stop. Stop. Stop what you're

256
00:40:53,050 --> 00:41:02,329
doing. The lockers. Okay. Oh no, not like I'll, this is Sesame Street bullshit all over again.

257
00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:35,260
Open locker all the way to the right. I checked that earlier. Oh god. I didn't even

258
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:47,059
say anything. A license plate. This is a chip. I'll take this. Good. It might be useful later.

259
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:59,989
I really like your hat. The writing's too sloppy for me to read.

260
00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:06,889
Why don't you analyze it? Sure thing. I'll analyze. December reading material

261
00:42:06,889 --> 00:42:11,289
purchases electronic newspaper magazines. All reading materials are to be returned to the

262
00:42:11,289 --> 00:42:22,460
designated spaces after use. Grab guard's note. It's a handwritten note. It doesn't look

263
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:32,739
important. To you, but it's reading material for me when I'm on the can. Um, okay. I mean,

264
00:42:32,739 --> 00:42:41,019
do I got a map? Where's my map? Okay, here's, there's some basic commands we got here.

265
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:50,150
Oh, I gotta like it. Okay. This is, this is giving me some tips on how to play.

266
00:42:52,659 --> 00:42:56,579
Javadab coming in with 10 community subs. I guess you're stumped too, operator.

267
00:42:56,579 --> 00:42:59,380
Javadab coming in with 10 community subs. What do you think about that?

268
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:08,579
Nothing at all. But thank you, Javadab. A lot of big subs and big bits

269
00:43:09,139 --> 00:43:14,579
very early in the stream. So thank you guys. Why were you in that holding cell?

270
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:35,510
Holding cell one. Okay. You're gonna go stop. Stop. Yes. Video recording, disc, handgun,

271
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:46,010
heel capsule. I need like the, I need a map. Here we go. Is he actually watching me?

272
00:43:50,630 --> 00:44:04,219
Go into the living room. Okay. I'll leave. Check table. The table. Okay. Look at all

273
00:44:04,219 --> 00:44:17,619
this shit on here. Drink coffee. Drink liquid in cup. Huh? This strange command. I don't get

274
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:25,340
it. Well, you don't get it obviously. Anything here of value that I need to get? Check document.

275
00:44:26,059 --> 00:44:36,920
Pardon me? Do what to what? Look at magazine. This is a really popular entertainment magazine.

276
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:49,690
I read it occasionally. Find fax machine. Fax me magazine. The vending machine. Okay. No,

277
00:44:49,690 --> 00:45:07,820
stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop. Yes. Check table. The table. Okay. Grab cup. Shooting will just put

278
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:20,969
a hole through it. Get in the clown car. 10 community subs. Thank you. Thank you to the

279
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:29,500
10 community subs clown car. Grab cup. This paper cup must be from the vending machine.

280
00:45:30,139 --> 00:45:41,349
It's empty. I'm not gonna say that. So there's nothing in it. I can't take it though. Take

281
00:45:41,349 --> 00:45:47,139
cup. I don't intend to take anything except what I need. But that's not what I'm telling you to do.

282
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:58,710
Check papers. Paper? There's a lot of paper around. Which do you mean? Check left paper.

283
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:08,070
It's a report by the security guards. Tell her to bark like a dog. Little dog or big dog?

284
00:46:12,139 --> 00:46:19,530
Scream as loud as you can. Let's see. This month's features on chips. I collect them too.

285
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:30,090
Scream. When you say it that way, I don't know what you mean. So what is that? That's report.

286
00:46:30,809 --> 00:46:38,679
What does that mean? A tablet? Check tablet. Are you talking about this? Yes. Yes. By the

287
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:49,780
desks? Okay. What? No, no, no, no, no. I was answering a question. That's all right. Grab

288
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:57,659
notebook. It's the security guards notebook. Like a diary. I'm not interested. Sure. Okay.

289
00:46:57,659 --> 00:47:07,579
We've got some consoles here. Activate left console. Not a chance. It's totally wrecked.

290
00:47:08,539 --> 00:47:13,099
All of them? All these PCs all fucked up. Caution. Malfunction caused by abnormal external

291
00:47:13,099 --> 00:47:25,190
shock. Yeah. What else is in here? Table. This is pretty much it. So we got, we got the stuff

292
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:35,050
we needed. Let's take, you know, holding cell. Go now. Holding cell one. Okay. Faster. By the

293
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:41,610
desks. Okay. Now holding cell one. Holding cell one. Okay. Run to holding cell one. Holding cell

294
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:54,139
one. Okay. How do I save the game? You guys are with the community subs tonight. Holy shit. Jamie,

295
00:47:54,139 --> 00:48:07,030
five community subs. Thank you. Run to holding cell one. Holding cell one. Okay.

296
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:22,920
Huh? What's this? Grab the Mio water enhancer. What even is that? Holding cell two. Holding

297
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:27,880
cell two. Right. There's nothing in here. I checked from corner to corner while I was locked up.

298
00:48:30,519 --> 00:48:36,090
Check holding cell three. Okay. Holding cell three. This place is empty. Let's check

299
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:48,019
somewhere else. Moron. I am walking. All right. Well I got it. Holding cell one. I checked

300
00:48:48,019 --> 00:48:55,380
everything. So now we gotta go. I'm not sure where the hell. How do I get? Go to the

301
00:48:55,380 --> 00:49:09,690
hallway. Okay. I'll leave. Never checked tablets. That's the save point? I told her to look at it

302
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:19,610
and she looked at me with. Operator, look. Emergency shutters have been activated all over

303
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:23,690
the place. It doesn't look like we'll be able to go on a casual tour of the station.

304
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:34,360
First there's something I'd like you to confirm. What's that? Please analyze this video disc.

305
00:49:38,139 --> 00:49:41,099
Interview footage. December 24th to the observatory restaurant.

306
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:47,110
On. Okay. You managed to get back. You couldn't just flip the phone up yourself.

307
00:49:49,989 --> 00:49:52,949
Do you see the woman who's interviewing Prime Minister Takayama?

308
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:59,510
Her name is Helen Johnson. She's a big wig announcer for a major TV network.

309
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,719
I need to find her and speak with her. She has information that can help me.

310
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:09,719
Your autograph can wait. I haven't found a single lead since the chaos started.

311
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:16,980
I'll have to check rooms one by one. Helen, the reporter and your Naomi.

312
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:22,099
Let's work together and find them. Okay. How about some guidance?

313
00:50:23,239 --> 00:50:30,980
Where should I start searching? I forget. I don't know what that place is even called.

314
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:44,469
So go to vending machine. Okay. I'll walk. Go to holding cell one. Shutter one. Okay.

315
00:50:44,469 --> 00:51:05,159
Oh no. What? What's going on? Oh, shoot head. Shoot. Shoot head. Shoot stomach.

316
00:51:09,019 --> 00:51:19,500
Turn around. Turn left. Back. Back. Back. Shoot head. Shoot stomach. One.

317
00:51:21,019 --> 00:51:43,099
Shoot head. Two. Shoot stomach. Two. Oh my God. Look at all this. I need to go. I need to

318
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:50,619
save the fucking game. Can I leave? All right. Let's check. We're right here.

319
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:58,710
Go to guest room one. I'm talking. Excuse me. Go to guest room one.

320
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:12,900
Guest room one. Okay. Hurry up. Yes. The guest rooms are locked for security purposes.

321
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:16,019
You should be able to disengage the locks on your end.

322
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:23,400
Well, I was trying to talk and she just started speaking over me.

323
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:27,110
She's like, give me directions. And I'm like, sure. I'll give you directions.

324
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:34,070
I, you even let, I'm giving directions right now. Thanks. She, I was speaking first.

325
00:52:44,889 --> 00:52:55,420
Is someone there? Pet peeve discovered. No, I'm just fucking kidding. So where should I begin

326
00:52:55,420 --> 00:53:02,840
checking? Tell me please. No, you know what? I, when I am talking to somebody, listen to

327
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:07,480
this. Okay. When you're in a conversation with somebody and everybody has that moment

328
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:11,159
where they know that you start, you both start talking at the same time.

329
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:15,320
Right. So I have something I want to say and you have something you want to say.

330
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:19,880
It usually goes by who got, who got it out first. Right. And then you start to have that

331
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:24,199
internal fake little battle where who's going to stop talking first, who's going to let the

332
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:29,559
other one just win. So, you know, for instance, if we're talking about a movie we saw

333
00:53:29,559 --> 00:53:33,159
and we're talking about like a Thanos or the infinity world was such a great movie.

334
00:53:33,159 --> 00:53:37,480
And especially, I think the point of the movie is when Thanos, like if I start saying what I

335
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:41,559
think the point of the movie is, and you start saying the point of the movie is at the same time,

336
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:47,159
one of us has to back down eventually. So what happens is whoever got the word out first,

337
00:53:49,000 --> 00:54:01,750
that person gets to keep going. The other one has to just back down. And then you can make

338
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:06,309
your point afterwards. Now, the problem is if that person does not let you in, right. So

339
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:10,389
if we start talking for five straight seconds, both, okay, you started saying you started

340
00:54:10,389 --> 00:54:13,590
talking first. I'm going to back down here and you're going to talk for about 30 or 40

341
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:18,230
seconds. Now let me come in and think about the ship. The ship was just bullshit. It's like,

342
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:26,489
okay, now you're not playing by the rules. Every, every about 30 or 40 seconds you got

343
00:54:26,489 --> 00:54:42,010
to let the other person in. Walk to table. You can't just talk for like two straight minutes

344
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:47,610
if somebody's in a conversation with you. It just doesn't work. Then that person eventually

345
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:54,500
is going to throw the hot coffee. Yes. Grab coffee cup.

346
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:22,409
Dump coffee on self. Grab camera. No film, no batteries, no lens. Okay, so

347
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:35,429
drink coffee. That's what I just said. All right. Read newspaper clipping.

348
00:55:44,469 --> 00:55:46,230
Ordinary people couldn't afford this hotel.

349
00:55:52,280 --> 00:56:05,079
Uh, save point. Go to save point. The save point, okay. Take out a hundred dollars cash.

350
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:18,949
No, no, no. Cancel the save. No, I forgot. Square is, it's the weird place that the

351
00:56:18,949 --> 00:56:27,380
old PlayStation systems had. Yeah. Guest room one. Hour and 23 minutes. Number of commands

352
00:56:27,380 --> 00:57:10,940
138. Go to bed. The bed. Okay. Monster. Shoot head. Shoot head. Dodge right. Shoot

353
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:31,349
stomach. Shoot mouth. Shoot stomach. Reload. Her aim is horrible. Yeah, it is. Don't,

354
00:57:31,349 --> 00:57:38,389
oh my God. That's giving me so much. Yes, you've done it. Thanks to you. We're saved.

355
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:51,050
What? You're just a damn waitress. Great. So what's your name, baby? It's Rio. Jesus.

356
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:58,170
This thing had us trapped in the bathroom. Now I control this guy too. Freaking mess. Son

357
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:03,690
of a. Would you spit on the floor? Isn't it my luck to be saved by some waitress,

358
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:11,449
but I suppose I do owe you a thanks. I bet you're some greedy little gold digger looking to hook

359
00:58:11,449 --> 00:58:19,750
a big sugar daddy and reel him in. Wait a minute. The monitors are live. Which ones?

360
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:25,590
Who's the operator anyway? George. He says he's a guest to the hotel. He's stuck in the

361
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:35,480
monitor room. Is that right? Well, that sucks for him. Doesn't it? Now you're on camera.

362
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:41,050
But what the hell is a guest doing in the monitor room? Yeah, somebody made a really

363
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:45,130
good point. Why are there cameras in the bedrooms? Well, if I know there was an

364
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:50,170
explosion, then those monsters appeared all over. God knows what the hell they are.

365
00:58:50,170 --> 00:58:56,170
Some alien swarm or other. Still, they ain't jack if you can blow them away with a handgun.

366
00:58:57,050 --> 00:59:01,210
Run along and rescue our guests. I'll look for the prime minister. This guy's gonna be

367
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:05,610
dead. But he came out of the transportation ministry and I'm screwed if he dies in my

368
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:12,809
hotel. Sir? What? Do you kiss your mother with that mouth? Whoa. Problem with it?

369
00:59:17,909 --> 00:59:26,710
Jerk. That was surprising. Save it for someone who cares, bimbo.

370
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:32,980
This guy's gonna end up like eaten in five minutes. Such an arrogant jerk. Yes,

371
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:42,329
that was manager Tanaka. He's in charge of this hotel. He told me to go rescue the guests.

372
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:50,699
Maybe he's the one who needs help. Well, anyway, what should we do now? We're in the bedroom,

373
00:59:50,699 --> 00:59:58,840
right? Go to bed. The bed, okay. It's an ordinary bed, but with soft springs in it for low

374
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:05,400
gravity use. Huh, I wonder what this is. Another one of those devices. Hey, a heel

375
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:10,460
capsule. It's like a flask of whiskey. There doesn't seem to be anything else.

376
01:00:12,739 --> 01:00:18,599
Lie in bed. The bed, okay. Lie down. There doesn't seem to be anything else.

377
01:00:19,239 --> 01:00:28,619
Let's check somewhere else. Jump on bed. The bed, okay. There doesn't seem to be anything else.

378
01:00:29,179 --> 01:00:46,199
Let's check somewhere else. Sit in chair. Nope. Uh, no. Okay. No. What else do we have here?

379
01:00:46,199 --> 01:00:57,780
We got, uh, go to the emergency panel. The emergency panel. Okay. Tell her to do a sexy pose.

380
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:03,719
Is that like, that's like a meme thing? Emergency tools are stored in here. I'm pretty

381
01:01:03,719 --> 01:01:11,530
certain that there's a key for the hallway shutters in here. That's strange. It looks

382
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:18,090
like someone's already taken it. Strange. What else? There's nothing else that needs checking.

383
01:01:18,889 --> 01:01:39,019
Uh, then I guess, you know, I guess do a pose. Do a pose. Do a sexy pose. Stop. Yes.

384
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:54,360
Do a pose. Hello. What was that? Do a pose. I am stopped. Do a sexy pose. This is horseshit.

385
01:01:54,360 --> 01:02:05,769
You guys just made me do this for no reason. Oh my God. I thought this is going to be like

386
01:02:05,769 --> 01:02:13,059
one of the meme inputs. Is he actually watching me? Oh my God. Damn it. Okay. Whatever.

387
01:02:15,030 --> 01:02:27,590
Go to the dresser. The dresser. Okay. You fuckers. It actually does exist.

388
01:02:32,409 --> 01:02:42,010
Look at mirror. I want to get changed out of this outfit. Check luggage. Are you talking about

389
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:56,710
this? Check trunk. This is a chip. Another chip. Let's take this. Does she know if you,

390
01:02:56,710 --> 01:03:01,030
how loud you are? I'm curious. All right. I'm going to be kind of loud here. So just want

391
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:04,309
to give you guys some warning. If you want to drag the volume slider a little bit to the

392
01:03:04,309 --> 01:03:15,820
left here. I'm going to give you some warning. Here we go. By the bed. Okay. No. There doesn't

393
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:23,750
seem to be anything else. Let's check somewhere else. Go to mirror. I am walking.

394
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:35,420
Go to mirror. The table. Okay. Stop. Yes. Check mirror. I am standing. Go to mirror.

395
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:45,079
The dresser. Okay. What a weird fucking word that is. Look in mirror. I checked that earlier.

396
01:03:45,079 --> 01:04:20,820
It's fine. Smash mirror. Eat glass. I'll go out into the hallway. Where should I go?

397
01:04:22,489 --> 01:04:30,059
That's a great question. Run to security room. The security room. Okay. Run there.

398
01:04:31,219 --> 01:04:37,659
There we go. Run. I am running. Run. I am running. Run faster. I am running. Run as fast

399
01:04:37,659 --> 01:04:58,940
as you can. This is this. This is okay. This is the security room. Leave. Yes. Leave. I am stopped.

400
01:05:01,059 --> 01:05:13,380
Leave room. Yes. I'm not going to say that. Leave the room. Don't do a lap. Do a lap. Yep.

401
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:22,360
Do a lap around the room. Okay. I'll leave. There we go. I'm not going to say that. Why

402
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:29,269
would I say that? That makes no sense. That doesn't make any sense. Why would that ever be

403
01:05:29,269 --> 01:05:45,400
an input? Where should I go? All right. We got guest room. We'll go. Go to guest room four.

404
01:05:46,119 --> 01:05:57,880
Guest room four. Okay. It's an Easter egg. Say it. Oh, is it really? Run. Yes. Walk.

405
01:05:59,159 --> 01:06:13,159
Crawl. Yes. Sneak. I am running. I don't think I can do anything here. You'll be able to

406
01:06:13,159 --> 01:06:17,400
control the shutter by inserting the emergency shutter key. I don't think I have that. If we

407
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:24,679
don't find the shutter key, we won't be able to progress. So we can't go that way.

408
01:06:25,639 --> 01:06:39,050
So we can go to... Maybe we can't. Because that's... We can go to security room. Guest room one.

409
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:53,320
Let's see. Go to shutter nine. Shutter nine. Okay. Can we open this? No. Go to shutter seven.

410
01:06:53,320 --> 01:07:02,659
Shutter seven. Okay. Run. Yes. Because only the two guest rooms. The guest room

411
01:07:02,659 --> 01:07:15,219
and security room. I need a key. Can I open this one? No, I can't. If we don't find the

412
01:07:15,219 --> 01:07:20,360
shutter key, we won't be able to progress. Is it the shutter keys in the guest room?

413
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:35,579
Go to security room. The security room. Okay. Run. Yes. Is that one thing on the table that

414
01:07:35,579 --> 01:07:45,530
I didn't actually look at? Braid hair? Freudian weapon. Thanks for the five community subs.

415
01:07:45,610 --> 01:08:00,889
Thank you so much. Five just came in. Check table. The table. Okay. What is this thing called?

416
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:09,610
Check newspaper. Oh. This is today's newspaper. That's too easy. And I'm not doing that. Why

417
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:17,539
would I... No, that doesn't do anything. Read newspaper? Today's opening party was the top

418
01:08:17,539 --> 01:08:27,659
story. Tomorrow it'll be front page news again. I can't believe I'm... No, I'm not

419
01:08:27,659 --> 01:08:35,579
going to say this because there's no way it's... There's no way. Go to guest room one. Leave the

420
01:08:35,579 --> 01:08:54,630
room? Okay. Leave room. Run. Run. Yes. Everyone in the chat is just shouting commands that

421
01:08:54,630 --> 01:09:12,340
I'm never going to say. Guest room one. Guest room one. Okay. Run. Run. Yes. Undo

422
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:19,100
the door lock please. It wasn't... Wasn't it already open? Oh my god. Why is it...

423
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:27,819
I just closed it. Sorry. The sun's sweet. Okay. What? No, no, no, no, no, no. Stop.

424
01:09:27,819 --> 01:09:43,979
Guest room one. Guest room one. Okay. Run. Yes. Undo the door lock please. Thanks. File

425
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:48,739
your taxes. You're doing it wrong. Jerma, we're giving commands to you, not the girl.

426
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:57,899
Well, none of that's going to happen. All right. Bathroom. Go to bathroom. The bathroom.

427
01:09:57,899 --> 01:10:08,739
Okay. Run. Yes. How did Tanaka manage to hide here? I think I see a disc underneath the sink.

428
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:22,060
Punch mirror. Is my face dirty? I'll wash it later. Wash face. It's an ordinary wash

429
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:36,710
stand. There's nothing unusual. Item under sink. Under the sink? Here's the shutter key.

430
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:51,819
Nice job. Nice job. Nice work. Nice work. Nice work. I didn't understand that.

431
01:10:51,819 --> 01:10:57,979
I said nice fucking work. I didn't understand that. Nice work. The floor has been thoroughly

432
01:10:57,979 --> 01:11:15,510
cleaned. It's sparkling. Good job. I'll walk. Back. The bathroom. Okay. Run. Yes. Shower. The

433
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:28,039
shower itself is ordinary. Over 90% of the water used here is recycled. Okay. Destroy window.

434
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:38,470
The living room. Okay. No, stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Shoot mirror. Shoot mirror. Back. The bed.

435
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:46,310
Okay. Stop. Yes. Shoot mirror. Go to mirror. Okay. I got it already. Stop. There doesn't

436
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:51,510
seem to be anything else. You don't got it. You don't got it. You don't got it. Go to

437
01:11:51,590 --> 01:12:10,279
bathroom. The bathroom. Okay. Run. Yes. Smash mirror. Okay. Now you can leave. What is it?

438
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:17,939
Shutter two. It's an ordinary shower. No, no. The water is recycled.

439
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:33,640
It's just a wash stand. Okay. I understand. Do you? Let's see. What did she understand?

440
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:44,539
Leave. Yes. Leave quickly. I am stopped. Leave. I am stopped. Hallway. Okay.

441
01:12:44,539 --> 01:12:57,140
I'll leave. Run. Yes. What an odd game. Strangely enough, though, this works way better

442
01:12:57,779 --> 01:13:01,460
than any game that's tried to do this 10 to 15 years later.

443
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:10,939
I'm getting interference. Hello. Operator. Wiggle mic. What? Wait, I'm hearing another voice.

444
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:25,220
Who is this? Other frequency. Hello. Hello. Operator. Can you hear me? There's definitely

445
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:33,159
someone calling for help. There's someone else alive out there. All right. Well, let's

446
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:45,060
what we're going to go shutter. We need some guests from two. Hold on. Come on. I need to

447
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:59,699
know what happens when I do this. I was going to sneeze. You're awfully slow with

448
01:13:59,699 --> 01:14:21,579
instructions. Hold on. Okay. I'll walk. Yes. Let's see if Shido can give some commands.

449
01:14:21,579 --> 01:14:27,770
You listen to me. This should open a shutter half the time. You listen to Shido completely.

450
01:14:28,569 --> 01:14:38,649
Hurry up and go back. No, Shido. Don't tell. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm going to

451
01:14:38,649 --> 01:14:48,420
override you here, Shido. Go back. Yep. Back to panel. No, we already looked under the bed.

452
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:58,359
There's nothing under the bed. No, we looked under the bed already. Analyze shutter panel.

453
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:07,159
It's okay. This control panel can be operated on your end. I'll get it. No, wait. The auto

454
01:15:07,159 --> 01:15:17,590
control emergency shutter can now be opened and closed. Open it. Give, give Shido a turn.

455
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:22,380
No, no, I have to do this. It's not going to understand you.

456
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:38,630
Shoot right eye. Back. Back. Shoot right eye. Left eye. Shoot. Middle eye. Shoot. Red eye.

457
01:15:38,630 --> 01:15:52,380
Shoot. You want to play? See how well Shido does. I'm just going to take a back seat here.

458
01:15:52,380 --> 01:16:10,020
There's going to be a Shido stream for about five minutes. You ready? Okay. You can say it a little

459
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:25,539
louder. What do you want me to try to say? What are you trying to say here? Try something

460
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:43,399
else because she's obviously not getting it. Okay. Well, give me proper instructions. I'm

461
01:16:43,399 --> 01:16:46,920
I know. I understand. Look, the game, the game is trying to listen to you. I know it's,

462
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:59,380
it's finicky sometimes. Maybe she's being too high. Go a little bit lower. I don't think this is

463
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:06,229
going to. No. All right. All right. Settle down. Settle down. I understand that they get,

464
01:17:06,229 --> 01:17:12,460
I know the game sucks. That's fine. You're freaking out. Okay. It's, it's not going to

465
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:27,989
hear you. Just go back to bed. Go back to bed. Let me take over. Okay. Doesn't work. Go.

466
01:17:27,989 --> 01:17:38,199
I am standing. Go to guest room two. Guest room two. Okay. Run. Yes. Stop.

467
01:17:40,199 --> 01:17:44,760
Run. Yes. Stop. Run. Yes. Stop. Run. Stop.

468
01:17:46,260 --> 01:18:21,560
Shido! Shido's in the game. Eat. Eat flour. Let me type in thing on face.

469
01:18:22,520 --> 01:19:04,380
All right. Here we go. Here we go. Apparently not. What? Go.

470
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:41,000
Go. No, close it. I just opened it. No, close it. Close the door. Oh, fuck. Oh, no. It's all

471
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:51,539
right. We're right there. Imagine if I didn't save it the whole time. Yeah. This is, this

472
01:19:51,539 --> 01:19:58,439
is simple. We're just going to run it. Look, we speed run on this. Go to bathroom. The

473
01:19:58,439 --> 01:20:08,859
bathroom. Run. Yes. Oh, fuck. We have to do this again. No, sorry. I'm just going to go

474
01:20:08,859 --> 01:20:16,789
bathroom and then door. We already got everything. Shoot mouth. Mouth. Shoot. Stomach.

475
01:20:16,789 --> 01:20:27,689
Shoot. The guy's going to come out. We're just going to skip it. Skip. Skip cut scene.

476
01:20:31,539 --> 01:20:38,810
Skip. Cutscene. Skip. Oh, fucking hell. Come on. Yes. You've done it. No skipping.

477
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:48,520
What? You're just a damn waitress? Great. So what's your name, baby?

478
01:20:49,159 --> 01:21:03,180
It's okay. I have to do this shit again. Damn it. I need to, I gotta remember this

479
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:11,479
PlayStation 2. You got to save it every time you do something. Oh, you're some greedy

480
01:21:11,479 --> 01:21:17,239
little gold digger. Look at the big sugar daddy and reel him in. No. What have I done?

481
01:21:19,220 --> 01:21:24,579
Wait a minute. The monitor's alive? Which ones? Who's the operator anyway?

482
01:21:24,579 --> 01:21:27,300
There's more than one camera. There's like five cameras in these rooms. He's a guest

483
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:35,979
to the hotel. He's stuck in the monitor room. Use Shito to voice act. That sucks for him,

484
01:21:35,979 --> 01:21:39,979
doesn't it? Shito is only going to leave you around for like 10 minutes per stream.

485
01:21:39,979 --> 01:21:43,819
What the hell is a guest doing in the monitor room? Mr. Schmelke, pardon me.

486
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:49,979
What's going on in the hotel? If I know, there was an explosion and then those monsters

487
01:21:49,979 --> 01:21:55,420
appeared all over. God knows what in the hell they are. Some alien swarm or other.

488
01:21:56,380 --> 01:21:58,539
Someone just clapped when Shito shows up, don't they?

489
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:04,939
Run along and rescue our guests. I'll look for the prime minister, the jackass.

490
01:22:04,939 --> 01:22:09,819
But he came out of the transportation ministry and I'm screwed if he dies in my hotel.

491
01:22:09,819 --> 01:22:15,979
I'm moving to Vegas. I've been here for a few months. You got a problem with it? I moved

492
01:22:15,979 --> 01:22:25,000
in October. To help and you're being a real jerk. Still on the balloon. I'm streaming from

493
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:36,119
the balloon. Save it for someone who cares, bimbo. He's such an arrogant jerk. Yes,

494
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:45,449
that was manager Tanaka. He's in charge of this hotel. He told me to go rescue the guests.

495
01:22:45,449 --> 01:22:50,329
Maybe he's the one who needs help. We're ready to go. What should we do now?

496
01:22:51,210 --> 01:22:55,750
Go to bathroom. The bathroom. Okay. Run. Yes.

497
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:10,890
How did Tanaka manage to hide here? Under sink. Under the sink? Oh, here's the shutter key.

498
01:23:11,689 --> 01:23:30,119
This will let us open that shutter. Yeah, it should. Out. Back. By the bed. Okay. Check

499
01:23:30,119 --> 01:23:37,210
trunk. I am walking. Check trunk. Check trunk. It's an ordinary bed but with soft springs

500
01:23:37,289 --> 01:23:47,960
in it for low gravity use. Huh. I wonder what this is. Some of the heel. Hey, a heel capsule.

501
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:56,390
There doesn't seem to be anything else. Check mirror. Stop. Yes. Check dresser. The dresser.

502
01:23:56,390 --> 01:24:05,109
Okay. Check trunk. We're not going back to earth yet. We can pack our luggage later.

503
01:24:06,409 --> 01:24:09,880
No, check it though. There's something down there. Check trunk.

504
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:19,909
Huh. This is a chip. All right. We are. We've made the same amount of progress we made in

505
01:24:19,909 --> 01:24:33,770
40 minutes. Shoot mirror. See. Okay. I did it. Everybody calm down. Save.

506
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:47,100
Save game. Where the hell is the dumb thing? Save point. The save point. Okay. Run. Run.

507
01:24:47,100 --> 01:25:28,390
Yes. Now we're good. All right. Let's go. Go. I am stopped. Go. I am stopped. Oh.

508
01:25:30,359 --> 01:25:40,729
Okay. I got it already. I'm really going. Uh. Hallway. Okay. I'll leave. Run. Yes.

509
01:25:45,289 --> 01:25:59,210
Go. I am stopped. Wait. We have a shutter tube. Here comes the transmission incoming.

510
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:06,710
Hello. Operator. What? Wait. I'm hearing another voice.

511
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:20,979
Who is this? Hello. Hello. Operator, can you hear me? She did. There's definitely

512
01:26:20,979 --> 01:26:29,670
someone calling for help. There's someone else alive out there. Shutter seven. Shutter seven.

513
01:26:29,670 --> 01:26:47,560
Okay. Here we go. Now I got to close. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. You'll be able to control the

514
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:52,729
shutter by inserting the emergency shutter key. All right. I remember this part. This time

515
01:26:52,729 --> 01:27:13,340
is not going to be. I'm going to close the door on the monster. I can't even read that right

516
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:29,880
now. Shoot right eye. Back up. Back. Middle eye. Left eye. Red eye. All right. We're good.

517
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:39,720
Same thing can happen. This time I'm going to close it. Guest room two. Guest room two.

518
01:27:40,039 --> 01:27:55,770
Run. Lady. Close the door on him. Save game. Tell me a story. Stop.

519
01:27:59,609 --> 01:28:15,750
Turn around. Turn around. All right. I got to make sure I choose the right thing.

520
01:28:29,909 --> 01:28:32,300
Close the door.

521
01:28:59,119 --> 01:29:02,000
Here we go

522
01:29:03,319 --> 01:29:08,300
Close

523
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:19,310
Every time it just freaks me out

524
01:29:20,109 --> 01:29:25,079
You don't have to hold the gun like a baby with your finger on the trigger like that's

525
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:28,260
It's scaring me saved

526
01:29:29,060 --> 01:29:31,180
Thank you

527
01:29:31,180 --> 01:29:43,859
Huh, you're welcome. Can you hear footsteps?

528
01:29:44,739 --> 01:29:51,199
Somebody's coming

529
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:57,859
Somebody is coming

530
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:02,100
Rio

531
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:08,119
Geno, how'd you get out of that holding cell? I had an operator open it for me

532
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
that idiot

533
01:30:11,359 --> 01:30:16,119
Inside the cell no alien would have reached you. Why is everybody? I thought you died

534
01:30:18,569 --> 01:30:22,770
It'll take a lot more than those aliens to kill me. I'm just a streamer

535
01:30:23,649 --> 01:30:26,210
So those are aliens. Yeah, I was watching German on eight five

536
01:30:26,369 --> 01:30:31,289
Fucking idiot. Hey, the good news is that a shuttle with a rescue team is on the way

537
01:30:31,289 --> 01:30:35,930
I ran into a researcher in the testing ward and he said they'd caught a radio signal

538
01:30:36,850 --> 01:30:39,630
I've got to tell the others about this right away

539
01:30:40,789 --> 01:30:46,180
Hey operator look after her. Okay. Oh

540
01:30:46,939 --> 01:30:48,939
Yeah here take this

541
01:30:49,619 --> 01:30:54,859
It's the voice password for one of the suites the researcher I met he's hiding in the Sun suite

542
01:30:55,340 --> 01:31:01,539
That sounds we I'm gonna keep looking for survivors make your way to the receiving port got it and be extra careful

543
01:31:01,539 --> 01:31:03,380
Let's go. Let's go. I

544
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:04,939
Gotta save the game

545
01:31:04,939 --> 01:31:11,920
The Sun suite. I think it's done this way

546
01:31:12,479 --> 01:31:14,859
If it's a voice password, just tell her

547
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:20,600
If you could forget it the rescue team is headed for the receiving port

548
01:31:21,039 --> 01:31:26,840
But the receiving port is on the other side of that spider monster

549
01:31:27,319 --> 01:31:30,300
So we gotta go the other way. There's no way I can get through there

550
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,579
Anyway, we should search every room

551
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:37,859
Searching for Naomi and Helen the reporter. That's our top priority

552
01:31:41,359 --> 01:31:43,859
All right, so we're across here we need to go to

553
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:52,079
Room two room three these are the two rooms. We got go to go to guest room to guest room to okay run. Yes

664
01:41:52,180 --> 01:41:57,619
It's not a waste to shoot the mirror that makes a mess, but it's a waste to shoot the dress. I

It's bothering me. I can't undo this lock. I can't

675
01:42:51,279 --> 01:42:53,279
Can't you open it on your side? Yes

676

Oh, it's a shutter key of all the strange places to find it

683
01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:41,229
Got the code. Why would someone lock it away in a safe?

684
01:43:42,590 --> 01:43:45,149
Because there's something more sinister going on here

685
01:43:46,659 --> 01:43:49,619
And we're gonna do some detective work to find go

686

1132
02:14:17,630 --> 02:14:20,270
The bride may now read the first portion

1133

In order to undo the lock to the sun suite, I guess we need another piece of the voice password

1143
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,590

Huh?

1207
02:20:24,969 --> 02:20:26,489
Look at chair.

1208
02:20:26,489 --> 02:20:27,250
The bedroom.

1209
02:20:27,250 --> 02:20:28,049
Stop.

1210
02:20:28,049 --> 02:20:28,569
Yes.

1211
02:20:28,569 --> 02:20:29,729
Emergency panel.

1212
02:20:29,729 --> 02:20:31,129
The emergency panel.

1213
02:20:31,129 --> 02:20:34,319
Okay.

1214
02:20:34,319 --> 02:20:37,520
Ugh, the shutter key's broken.

1215
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:38,600
Come on, really?

1216
02:20:38,600 --> 02:20:41,530
We can't use this anymore.

1217
02:20:41,530 --> 02:20:45,139
Let's check somewhere else.

1218
02:20:45,139 --> 02:20:49,780
Well, uh, look out window.

1219
02:20:49,780 --> 02:20:51,229
Huh?

1220
02:20:51,229 --> 02:20:53,149
Look out the window.

1221
02:20:53,149 --> 02:20:55,870
This is the living room.

1222
02:20:55,870 --> 02:20:57,309
Dumb person.

1223
02:20:57,309 --> 02:20:59,510
Look out window.

1224
02:20:59,549 --> 02:21:03,770
This is the living room.

1225
02:21:03,770 --> 02:21:05,409
Check living room.

1226
02:21:05,409 --> 02:21:07,420
This is the living room.

1227
02:21:07,420 --> 02:21:08,700
Green box.

1228
02:21:08,700 --> 02:21:09,540
Check.

1229
02:21:09,540 --> 02:21:10,620
Okay, I got it already.

1230
02:21:10,620 --> 02:21:11,459
Stop.

1231
02:21:11,459 --> 02:21:12,709
Yes.

1232
02:21:12,709 --> 02:21:16,750
Grab heel capsule on green box.

1233
02:21:16,750 --> 02:21:17,590
The bedroom.

1234
02:21:17,590 --> 02:21:18,549
Stop.

1235
02:21:18,549 --> 02:21:19,389
Yes.

1236
02:21:22,899 --> 02:21:24,899
Pick up heel capsule.

1237
02:21:24,899 --> 02:21:28,219
Huh?

1238
02:21:28,219 --> 02:21:29,059
Ugh.

1239
02:21:29,059 --> 02:21:29,899
Stop.

1240
02:21:29,899 --> 02:21:34,950
Okay.

1241
02:21:34,950 --> 02:21:35,989
Go to living room.

1242
02:21:35,989 --> 02:21:37,459
Oh, hey.

1243
02:21:37,459 --> 02:21:38,299
I didn't even do this.

1244
02:21:38,299 --> 02:21:41,309
What's a chip doing here?

1245
02:21:41,350 --> 02:21:43,149
There's a heel capsule in the corner.

1246
02:21:43,149 --> 02:21:45,110
There doesn't seem to be anything else.

1247
02:21:45,110 --> 02:21:50,299
Let's check somewhere else.

1248
02:21:50,299 --> 02:21:51,260
Living area.

1249
02:21:51,260 --> 02:21:52,340
The living area.

1250
02:21:52,340 --> 02:21:54,700
Okay.

1251
02:21:54,700 --> 02:21:55,540
Stop.

1252
02:21:55,540 --> 02:21:56,379
Yes.

1253
02:21:56,379 --> 02:21:57,219
Turn around.

1254
02:21:57,219 --> 02:21:58,059
Yes.

1255
02:21:58,059 --> 02:21:59,420
Stop.

1256
02:21:59,420 --> 02:22:01,260
Check living area.

1257
02:22:01,260 --> 02:22:02,340
The living area.

1258
02:22:02,340 --> 02:22:07,500
Okay.

1259
02:22:07,500 --> 02:22:09,500
Huh?

1260
02:22:09,500 --> 02:22:11,819
All right.

1261
02:22:11,819 --> 02:22:13,420
Grab helmet.

1262
02:22:13,420 --> 02:22:14,700
If I put on something like this,

1263
02:22:14,700 --> 02:22:16,420
my hair would be totally messed up.

1264
02:22:16,420 --> 02:22:19,549
Do you really care about that right now?

1265
02:22:19,549 --> 02:22:20,709
Check helmet.

1266
02:22:20,709 --> 02:22:21,549
This?

1267
02:22:21,549 --> 02:22:22,389
Look underneath, there's probably money in there.

1268
02:22:22,670 --> 02:22:24,979
Engineering staff use.

1269
02:22:24,979 --> 02:22:30,049
It's odd to find this here.

1270
02:22:30,049 --> 02:22:32,209
Look at metal pipe.

1271
02:22:32,209 --> 02:22:35,479
But why is there a steel pipe in a guest room?

1272
02:22:35,479 --> 02:22:36,920
Pick up steel pipe.

1273
02:22:36,920 --> 02:22:38,260
I have a hand.

1274
02:22:38,260 --> 02:22:39,100
I won't be needing this.

1275
02:22:39,100 --> 02:22:41,790
But what about Melee?

1276
02:22:41,790 --> 02:22:44,459
Okay.

1277
02:22:44,459 --> 02:22:46,260
Check green box.

1278
02:22:46,260 --> 02:22:47,100
Are you talking about this?

1279
02:22:47,100 --> 02:22:48,100
That is what I'm talking about.

1280
02:22:48,100 --> 02:22:51,079
I'm glad you picked up on it.

1281
02:22:51,079 --> 02:22:52,719
Check rations.

1282
02:22:52,719 --> 02:22:55,819
It's the hotel's emergency rations.

1283
02:22:55,819 --> 02:22:56,659
Eat some.

1284
02:22:56,659 --> 02:22:58,959
They're stored in the equipment room.

1285
02:22:58,959 --> 02:22:59,799
Oh, hey.

1286
02:22:59,799 --> 02:23:01,559
There's a heel capsule by the rations.

1287
02:23:01,639 --> 02:23:02,479
Oh, hey.

1288
02:23:02,479 --> 02:23:03,319
I wonder who told you that?

1289
02:23:03,319 --> 02:23:06,340
I just came up with that on my own.

1290
02:23:06,340 --> 02:23:07,379
Look at corpse.

1291
02:23:07,379 --> 02:23:08,700
Corpse?

1292
02:23:08,700 --> 02:23:10,260
There's nothing like that in here.

1293
02:23:10,260 --> 02:23:13,139
It's behind it.

1294
02:23:13,139 --> 02:23:16,739
Look behind chair, couch.

1295
02:23:16,739 --> 02:23:18,059
What is this?

1296
02:23:18,059 --> 02:23:19,559
Behind.

1297
02:23:19,559 --> 02:23:23,139
What are you trying to say?

1298
02:23:23,139 --> 02:23:25,719
There isn't anything.

1299
02:23:25,719 --> 02:23:27,440
Look behind the chair.

1300
02:23:27,440 --> 02:23:28,319
Behind the chair?

1301
02:23:28,319 --> 02:23:29,399
Yeah.

1302
02:23:29,399 --> 02:23:34,520
This person's dead.

1303
02:23:34,520 --> 02:23:38,090
He was hiding here

1304
02:23:38,090 --> 02:23:44,090
in hopes of finding protection.

1305
02:23:44,090 --> 02:23:44,930
What was that?

1306
02:23:44,930 --> 02:23:45,770
Voice password.

1307
02:23:45,770 --> 02:23:46,610
Ooh.

1308
02:23:46,610 --> 02:23:47,450
Nice.

1309
02:23:47,450 --> 02:23:48,370
Now we can get into the Sun Suite.

1310
02:23:48,370 --> 02:23:49,780
Yes, we can.

1311
02:23:49,780 --> 02:23:50,620
Time for the Sun Suite.

1312
02:23:50,620 --> 02:23:52,219
Let's get over there.

1313
02:23:52,219 --> 02:23:53,379
Okay, let's go.

1314
02:23:56,579 --> 02:23:58,700
It might be way, there might be some, hold on.

1315
02:23:58,700 --> 02:24:00,219
Check bedroom.

1316
02:24:00,219 --> 02:24:02,059
The bedroom, okay.

1317
02:24:02,059 --> 02:24:04,459
Run, run, run.

1318
02:24:04,459 --> 02:24:06,719
Yes.

1319
02:24:06,719 --> 02:24:08,540
Check table.

1320
02:24:08,540 --> 02:24:10,020
Stop.

1321
02:24:10,020 --> 02:24:11,260
Check table.

1322
02:24:11,260 --> 02:24:12,500
The table, okay.

1323
02:24:16,079 --> 02:24:17,559
Mmm.

1324
02:24:17,559 --> 02:24:19,280
Turn on movie.

1325
02:24:19,280 --> 02:24:21,719
There's not much point in moving this.

1326
02:24:21,719 --> 02:24:23,690
What else should I do?

1327
02:24:23,690 --> 02:24:25,530
Turn on projector.

1328
02:24:25,530 --> 02:24:27,489
Turn on the projector?

1329
02:24:27,489 --> 02:24:30,409
Actually, you have to analyze the thing and turn it on.

1330
02:24:30,409 --> 02:24:32,809
You do it.

1331
02:24:32,809 --> 02:24:35,729
Well, I can't even, check projector.

1332
02:24:35,729 --> 02:24:37,569
And I can't even target it.

1333
02:24:37,569 --> 02:24:38,809
If you turn the power on for me,

1334
02:24:38,809 --> 02:24:47,500
it might show something.

1335
02:24:47,500 --> 02:24:51,219
This is the station's floor map.

1336
02:24:51,219 --> 02:24:52,059
This is halo.

1337
02:24:52,059 --> 02:24:52,899
See?

1338
02:24:52,899 --> 02:24:55,020
This is guest room four, where I am.

1339
02:25:00,920 --> 02:25:02,799
You're in the monitor room.

1340
02:25:02,799 --> 02:25:05,579
It's pretty far from the hotel section.

1341
02:25:05,579 --> 02:25:10,700
And that's the receiving port.

1342
02:25:11,920 --> 02:25:14,040
If Geno's story is true,

1343
02:25:14,040 --> 02:25:18,930
the rescue team will be arriving here.

1344
02:25:18,930 --> 02:25:21,049
That's new info that we didn't have before,

1345
02:25:21,049 --> 02:25:22,049
so I'm glad to have it.

1346
02:25:22,049 --> 02:25:22,889
All right.

1347
02:25:22,889 --> 02:25:24,450
Look at book.

1348
02:25:24,450 --> 02:25:27,520
What should I check?

1349
02:25:27,520 --> 02:25:28,559
The book.

1350
02:25:28,559 --> 02:25:30,200
Okay, I understand.

1351
02:25:30,200 --> 02:25:31,040
No, you don't.

1352
02:25:31,040 --> 02:25:33,399
That means, okay, every time she says I understand,

1353
02:25:33,399 --> 02:25:34,479
that means I don't understand.

1354
02:25:34,479 --> 02:25:35,319
Stop.

1355
02:25:35,319 --> 02:25:36,479
Yes.

1356
02:25:36,479 --> 02:25:38,430
Every time.

1357
02:25:38,430 --> 02:25:39,549
Check table.

1358
02:25:39,549 --> 02:25:40,389
The table.

1359
02:25:40,389 --> 02:25:45,340
Okay.

1360
02:25:45,340 --> 02:25:48,049
Look at tablecloth.

1361
02:25:48,049 --> 02:25:54,219
It looks like a tornado hit this place.

1362
02:25:54,219 --> 02:25:56,649
What?

1363
02:25:56,649 --> 02:25:59,219
Tablecloth on table.

1364
02:25:59,219 --> 02:26:01,180
What is that instruction?

1365
02:26:01,180 --> 02:26:04,270
I don't know what you mean.

1366
02:26:04,270 --> 02:26:06,590
Open tablecloth.

1367
02:26:06,590 --> 02:26:07,430
Are you talking about that?

1368
02:26:07,430 --> 02:26:09,469
Yes.

1369
02:26:09,469 --> 02:26:12,379
That's a blueprint?

1370
02:26:12,379 --> 02:26:16,180
That is a picnic tablecloth.

1371
02:26:16,180 --> 02:26:18,379
Look at blueprint.

1372
02:26:18,379 --> 02:26:20,950
It's the hotel blueprints.

1373
02:26:20,950 --> 02:26:25,510
This guest must have been on staff.

1374
02:26:25,510 --> 02:26:27,110
Check, use.

1375
02:26:27,110 --> 02:26:28,270
It's an ordinary chair.

1376
02:26:28,270 --> 02:26:31,670
I don't even know what the fuck to do with that.

1377
02:26:31,670 --> 02:26:33,069
Look at blueprint.

1378
02:26:33,069 --> 02:26:35,510
There's not much point in moving this.

1379
02:26:35,510 --> 02:26:37,729
What else should I do?

1380
02:26:37,729 --> 02:26:38,889
Green book.

1381
02:26:38,889 --> 02:26:43,389
Are you talking about this?

1382
02:26:43,389 --> 02:26:44,829
Take questionnaire.

1383
02:26:44,829 --> 02:26:46,920
A questionnaire?

1384
02:26:46,920 --> 02:26:50,600
We don't need this either.

1385
02:26:50,600 --> 02:26:53,180
Shoot projector.

1386
02:26:53,180 --> 02:26:56,750
I think it would be better if we didn't wreck this.

1387
02:26:56,750 --> 02:26:59,049
Shoot screen.

1388
02:26:59,049 --> 02:27:01,850
Putting a hole through it will make it useless.

1389
02:27:01,850 --> 02:27:03,879
Let's not.

1390
02:27:03,879 --> 02:27:07,500
Shoot mirror.

1391
02:27:07,500 --> 02:27:08,620
Shoot the mirror.

1392
02:27:08,620 --> 02:27:09,860
Are you talking about that?

1393
02:27:09,860 --> 02:27:11,260
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm, no.

1394
02:27:11,260 --> 02:27:12,139
Stop.

1395
02:27:12,139 --> 02:27:14,180
So I should run, OK?

1396
02:27:14,180 --> 02:27:16,340
No.

1397
02:27:16,340 --> 02:27:17,739
Stop.

1398
02:27:17,739 --> 02:27:19,500
Shoot the mirror.

1399
02:27:19,500 --> 02:27:21,059
Shoot mirror.

1400
02:27:21,059 --> 02:27:23,059
Shoot mirror.

1401
02:27:23,059 --> 02:27:25,379
Shoot mirror.

1402
02:27:25,379 --> 02:27:26,500
What is it?

1403
02:27:26,500 --> 02:27:27,459
Check dresser.

1404
02:27:27,459 --> 02:27:28,059
The dresser.

1405
02:27:28,059 --> 02:27:35,120
Ah.

1406
02:27:35,120 --> 02:27:36,559
Grab checkbook.

1407
02:27:36,559 --> 02:27:37,690
Huh?

1408
02:27:37,690 --> 02:27:42,170
It's just an ordinary chair.

1409
02:27:42,170 --> 02:27:44,409
Look at checkbook.

1410
02:27:44,409 --> 02:27:45,540
Huh?

1411
02:27:45,540 --> 02:27:50,260
It's just an ordinary chair.

1412
02:27:50,260 --> 02:27:55,180
Grab invitation.

1413
02:27:55,180 --> 02:27:57,620
This is an invitation from JSL.

1414
02:27:57,620 --> 02:28:00,500
So this guest must have been well-connected or pressed.

1415
02:28:00,500 --> 02:28:04,540
The one on the back.

1416
02:28:04,540 --> 02:28:06,059
Use invitation.

1417
02:28:06,059 --> 02:28:07,739
The invitation?

1418
02:28:07,739 --> 02:28:11,379
I don't know what you mean.

1419
02:28:11,379 --> 02:28:23,420
Shoot mirror.

1420
02:28:23,420 --> 02:28:25,170
You made a mess.

1421
02:28:25,170 --> 02:28:28,139
Are you talking about this?

1422
02:28:28,139 --> 02:28:33,329
Yeah, the thing that you just did.

1423
02:28:33,329 --> 02:28:35,819
Shoot invitation.

1424
02:28:35,819 --> 02:28:38,329
I will just put a hole through it.

1425
02:28:38,329 --> 02:28:41,459
Why do you have such a problem with shooting anything

1426
02:28:41,459 --> 02:28:43,850
that's not a mirror?

1427
02:28:43,850 --> 02:28:45,770
Do you just hate the sight of your own reflection?

1428
02:28:45,770 --> 02:28:51,729
I don't understand.

1429
02:28:51,729 --> 02:28:52,989
Leave.

1430
02:28:52,989 --> 02:28:56,420
Do what with what?

1431
02:28:56,420 --> 02:28:59,100
Go to the honeymoon suite.

1432
02:28:59,100 --> 02:29:00,299
I'll go out into the hallway.

1433
02:29:00,299 --> 02:29:00,780
What is it?

1434
02:29:00,780 --> 02:29:03,829
Let's put the sun suite.

1435
02:29:03,829 --> 02:29:06,639
Go to sun suite.

1436
02:29:06,639 --> 02:29:08,219
Sun suite.

1437
02:29:08,219 --> 02:29:10,739
Well, I still have my health.

1438
02:29:10,739 --> 02:29:12,020
Sun suite.

1439
02:29:12,020 --> 02:29:13,709
I am stopped.

1440
02:29:13,709 --> 02:29:15,870
Head to the sun suite.

1441
02:29:15,870 --> 02:29:18,020
I am stopped.

1442
02:29:18,020 --> 02:29:19,180
Check the bathroom.

1443
02:29:19,180 --> 02:29:19,940
The bathroom.

1444
02:29:19,940 --> 02:29:22,100
OK.

1445
02:29:22,100 --> 02:29:22,739
Run.

1446
02:29:22,739 --> 02:29:25,659
Yes.

1447
02:29:25,659 --> 02:29:27,459
There's nothing here.

1448
02:29:27,459 --> 02:29:30,670
Let's look elsewhere.

1449
02:29:30,670 --> 02:29:32,420
Shoot mirror.

1450
02:29:32,420 --> 02:29:34,549
Shoot mirror in bathroom.

1451
02:29:34,549 --> 02:29:36,500
Yes.

1452
02:29:36,500 --> 02:29:50,940
Oh!

1453
02:29:50,940 --> 02:29:51,979
Go to save point.

1454
02:29:51,979 --> 02:29:52,659
The save point.

1455
02:29:52,659 --> 02:29:52,899
Run.

1456
02:29:52,899 --> 02:29:53,700
OK.

1457
02:29:53,700 --> 02:29:53,940
Yes.

1458
02:29:53,940 --> 02:29:54,540
Run.

1459
02:29:54,540 --> 02:29:56,280
I am running.

1460
02:29:56,280 --> 02:29:56,799
God damn it.

1461
02:29:56,799 --> 02:30:10,899
Whatever.

1462
02:30:10,899 --> 02:30:11,979
End of stream voice.

1463
02:30:11,979 --> 02:30:19,540
No.

1464
02:30:19,540 --> 02:30:20,379
Well, I mean, look.

1465
02:30:20,420 --> 02:30:22,579
I did say shoot mirror.

1466
02:30:22,579 --> 02:30:25,100
And I see her put her hand up towards her face.

1467
02:30:25,100 --> 02:30:29,549
I'm just like, what the fuck is she doing?

1468
02:30:29,549 --> 02:30:32,379
Boo!

1469
02:30:32,379 --> 02:30:33,059
The bed.

1470
02:30:33,059 --> 02:30:33,379
OK.

1471
02:30:33,379 --> 02:30:34,379
Stop.

1472
02:30:34,379 --> 02:30:34,899
Yes.

1473
02:30:34,899 --> 02:30:37,459
Go to the sun honeymoon suite.

1474
02:30:37,459 --> 02:30:38,420
The living room.

1475
02:30:38,420 --> 02:30:38,940
OK.

1476
02:30:38,940 --> 02:30:41,440
Out.

1477
02:30:41,440 --> 02:30:42,559
Leave hallway.

1478
02:30:42,559 --> 02:30:43,239
OK.

1479
02:30:43,239 --> 02:30:43,799
I'll leave.

1480
02:30:43,799 --> 02:30:44,399
Run.

1481
02:30:44,399 --> 02:30:58,139
Yes.

1482
02:30:58,139 --> 02:31:00,260
Where should I go?

02:31:13,889 --> 02:31:15,299
Little dog?

02:31:15,299 --> 02:31:16,139

And with our shining doubts, we make the commands to each other

1519

1520

02:33:12,309 --> 02:33:13,709
What's going on?

1529
02:33:13,709 --> 02:33:15,110
In case you forgot, we also have

1530
02:33:15,110 --> 02:33:17,309

1531
02:33:17,750 --> 02:33:18,590
Fuck.

Over the river and through the woods

1556

02:34:43,739 --> 02:34:49,659
How did this even happen?

1563
02:34:49,659 --> 02:34:53,000
Somebody got it?

1564
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,120
What was it?

1565
02:34:55,120 --> 02:34:55,959
Hold on.

No, that's the gnome video thing.

That's me slapping myself.

1574

02:35:15,680 --> 02:35:20,729
I need to hear this.

1576
02:35:20,729 --> 02:35:21,569
Let's see what I said.

1577
02:35:21,569 --> 02:35:27,110
Will the groom please clear the room?

1578
02:35:27,110 --> 02:35:30,989

02:36:16,290 --> 02:36:20,610
With our, and with our shining doubts.

1601
02:36:20,610 --> 02:36:21,729
Just play it into the mic.

1602
02:36:21,729 --> 02:36:22,729
I can't, can I even do that?

1603
02:36:22,729 --> 02:36:23,569

02:39:21,149 --> 02:39:25,569
You may both enter.

1668
02:39:25,569 --> 02:39:26,569
Ready?

1669
02:39:26,569 --> 02:39:27,569
I'm ready.

1670
02:39:27,569 --> 02:39:30,739
Even the very shadow that you cast in sunlight.

1671
02:39:30,739 --> 02:39:34,239
I want to monopolize.

1672
02:39:34,239 --> 02:39:35,239
Authentication successful.

1673
02:39:35,239 --> 02:39:36,239
Oh my god.

1674
02:39:36,239 --> 02:39:37,239
Get us in here.

1675
02:39:37,239 --> 02:39:38,239
Please enter.

1676
02:39:38,239 --> 02:39:47,739
We finally made it in here.

1677
02:39:48,739 --> 02:39:59,850
We made it to the suite.

1678
02:39:59,850 --> 02:40:01,850
The honeymoon suite.

1679
02:40:08,670 --> 02:40:13,670
That's just a bathroom tile at a beach bathroom.

1680
02:40:24,569 --> 02:40:25,569
Oh boy.

1681
02:40:25,569 --> 02:40:27,940
Coffee table.

1682
02:40:27,940 --> 02:40:35,940
The coffee table, okay.

1683
02:40:35,940 --> 02:40:38,110
Meow like a cat.

1684
02:40:45,190 --> 02:40:47,190
Grab coffee cup.

1685
02:40:48,190 --> 02:40:50,190
She just never wants to drink the coffee, ever.

1686
02:40:50,190 --> 02:40:52,819
Read paper.

1687
02:40:59,819 --> 02:41:05,040
Okay, complimentary gift in the lounge.

1688
02:41:05,040 --> 02:41:06,040
That's it.

1689
02:41:06,040 --> 02:41:07,040
This is the lounge.

1690
02:41:07,040 --> 02:41:09,040
Go to the lounge.

1691
02:41:09,040 --> 02:41:17,420
They're gonna be both just be dead on the ground here.

1692
02:41:17,420 --> 02:41:21,799
Alright, we got a piece of fish.

1693
02:41:21,799 --> 02:41:25,420
A purple circle.

1694
02:41:25,420 --> 02:41:27,420
It's decorated for honeymooners.

1695
02:41:27,420 --> 02:41:29,729
Notice all the fruit?

1696
02:41:29,729 --> 02:41:32,030
What kind of fruit is that?

1697
02:41:32,030 --> 02:41:33,590
Is it purple apple?

1698
02:41:33,590 --> 02:41:35,590
Grab purple apple.

1699
02:41:35,590 --> 02:41:37,590
Are you talking about this?

1700
02:41:37,590 --> 02:41:40,340
That's not a grape.

1701
02:41:40,340 --> 02:41:41,340
That's a huge.

1702
02:41:41,340 --> 02:41:42,340
That's not a plum.

1703
02:41:42,340 --> 02:41:43,340
Plums are way smaller than that.

1704
02:41:43,340 --> 02:41:44,340
Grab plum.

1705
02:41:44,340 --> 02:41:46,340
Are you talking about this?

1706
02:41:46,340 --> 02:41:47,340
Look at champagne.

1707
02:41:47,340 --> 02:41:53,280
Product of Champagne France.

1708
02:41:53,280 --> 02:41:55,780
It's a real thing.

1709
02:41:55,780 --> 02:41:57,780
Far from cheap.

1710
02:41:57,780 --> 02:42:00,020
But unfortunately empty.

1711
02:42:00,020 --> 02:42:02,379
You didn't want to drink the last one.

1712
02:42:02,379 --> 02:42:04,379
Look at fruits.

1713
02:42:04,379 --> 02:42:06,379
Yeah, there's all kinds of fruit.

1714
02:42:06,379 --> 02:42:09,940
All places to find a chip.

1715
02:42:09,940 --> 02:42:12,819
You can't tell me that.

1716
02:42:12,819 --> 02:42:13,819
What fruit?

1717
02:42:13,819 --> 02:42:15,819
Are those supposed to be bananas?

1718
02:42:15,819 --> 02:42:16,819
They don't look like bananas at all.

1719
02:42:16,819 --> 02:42:17,819
Alright, what about...

1720
02:42:17,819 --> 02:42:19,819
Look at fish.

1721
02:42:19,819 --> 02:42:20,819
The second floor.

1722
02:42:20,819 --> 02:42:21,819
Stop.

1723
02:42:21,819 --> 02:42:22,819
Stop.

1724
02:42:23,819 --> 02:42:24,819
Stop.

1725
02:42:24,819 --> 02:42:25,819
Yes.

1726
02:42:25,819 --> 02:42:26,819
Table.

1727
02:42:26,819 --> 02:42:27,819
The coffee table.

1728
02:42:27,819 --> 02:42:28,819
No, stop, stop, stop.

1729
02:42:28,819 --> 02:42:29,819
The second floor.

1730
02:42:29,819 --> 02:42:30,819
Stop.

1731
02:42:30,819 --> 02:42:31,819
The fruits.

1732
02:42:31,819 --> 02:42:32,819
The bed.

1733
02:42:32,819 --> 02:42:33,819
Stop.

1734
02:42:33,819 --> 02:42:34,819
Yes.

1735
02:42:34,819 --> 02:42:35,819
Check the fruits.

1736
02:42:35,819 --> 02:42:36,819
I am standing.

1737
02:42:36,819 --> 02:42:37,819
Go to the fruit table.

1738
02:42:37,819 --> 02:42:38,819
The coffee table.

1739
02:42:38,819 --> 02:42:40,770
Stop what you're doing.

1740
02:42:40,770 --> 02:42:41,770
The lounge.

1741
02:42:41,770 --> 02:42:42,770
Go to the lounge.

1742
02:42:42,770 --> 02:42:43,770
Okay, the lounge.

1743
02:42:43,770 --> 02:42:45,709
Run.

1744
02:42:45,709 --> 02:42:46,709
Run.

1745
02:42:46,709 --> 02:42:47,709
I am running.

1746
02:42:47,709 --> 02:42:54,340
Look at dinner plate.

1747
02:42:54,340 --> 02:42:56,520
I'll go out into the hallway.

1748
02:42:56,520 --> 02:42:57,520
Stop.

1749
02:42:57,520 --> 02:42:58,520
Stop, stop.

1750
02:42:58,520 --> 02:42:59,520
Yes.

1751
02:42:59,520 --> 02:43:00,520
Lounge.

1752
02:43:00,520 --> 02:43:01,520
The lounge.

1753
02:43:01,520 --> 02:43:02,520
Run.

1754
02:43:02,520 --> 02:43:05,360
Okay.

1755
02:43:05,360 --> 02:43:06,360
Yes.

1756
02:43:06,360 --> 02:43:07,360
Look at plate.

1757
02:43:07,360 --> 02:43:08,360
I've checked it earlier.

1758
02:43:08,360 --> 02:43:09,360
You didn't look at the plate.

1759
02:43:09,360 --> 02:43:10,729
That was enough.

1760
02:43:10,729 --> 02:43:11,729
What is that thing?

1761
02:43:11,729 --> 02:43:12,729
What is that supposed to be?

1762
02:43:12,729 --> 02:43:13,729
Look at picture.

1763
02:43:13,729 --> 02:43:14,729
Are you talking about this?

1764
02:43:14,729 --> 02:43:15,729
I thought it was food.

1765
02:43:15,729 --> 02:43:17,729
I thought it was a plate with a piece of fish on it.

1766
02:43:17,729 --> 02:43:18,729
Look at the photograph.

1767
02:43:18,729 --> 02:43:23,540
It's a photo of the guests from their wedding.

1768
02:43:23,540 --> 02:43:27,510
Everyone looks so happy.

1769
02:43:27,510 --> 02:43:28,510
Check couch.

1770
02:43:28,510 --> 02:43:30,510
I've checked it earlier.

1771
02:43:30,510 --> 02:43:32,510
That was enough.

1772
02:43:32,510 --> 02:43:40,319
Red sofa.

1773
02:43:40,319 --> 02:43:42,690
Check sofa.

1774
02:43:42,690 --> 02:43:45,690
There's more than enough room on this sofa for just a couple of people.

1775
02:43:45,690 --> 02:43:49,399
Oh my goodness.

1776
02:43:49,399 --> 02:43:51,399
Look at flowers on sofa.

1777
02:43:51,399 --> 02:43:52,399
I'll go out into the hallway.

1778
02:43:52,399 --> 02:43:53,399
Stop what you're doing.

1779
02:43:53,399 --> 02:43:55,399
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

1780
02:43:55,399 --> 02:43:57,399
Yes.

1781
02:43:57,399 --> 02:43:58,399
Look at sofa.

1782
02:43:58,399 --> 02:43:59,399
Okay.

1783
02:43:59,399 --> 02:44:00,399
I'll leave.

1784
02:44:00,399 --> 02:44:01,399
Stop.

1785
02:44:01,399 --> 02:44:02,399
Yes.

1786
02:44:02,399 --> 02:44:03,399
Go.

1787
02:44:03,399 --> 02:44:09,610
Yes.

1788
02:44:09,610 --> 02:44:10,610
Lounge.

1789
02:44:10,610 --> 02:44:11,610
The lounge.

1790
02:44:11,610 --> 02:44:12,610
Yes.

1791
02:44:12,610 --> 02:44:19,989
Flowers.

1792
02:44:19,989 --> 02:44:21,989
Are you talking about that?

1793
02:44:21,989 --> 02:44:22,989
Yeah.

1794
02:44:22,989 --> 02:44:26,899
Look at banquet.

1795
02:44:26,899 --> 02:44:27,899
Look at the bouquet.

1796
02:44:27,899 --> 02:44:29,899
It's pretty, isn't it?

1797
02:44:29,899 --> 02:44:32,389
But they're fake flowers.

1798
02:44:32,389 --> 02:44:35,389
Real flowers can't take the stress if the G-Force is on launch.

1799
02:44:35,389 --> 02:44:39,489
That was completely and totally worthless.

1800
02:44:39,489 --> 02:44:40,489
Save point.

1801
02:44:40,489 --> 02:44:41,489
The save point.

1802
02:44:41,489 --> 02:44:43,920
Okay.

1803
02:44:43,920 --> 02:44:44,920
Run.

1804
02:44:44,920 --> 02:44:45,920
Yes.

1805
02:44:45,920 --> 02:44:51,770
Fake flowers.

1806
02:44:51,770 --> 02:44:52,770
Yeah, they are fake.

1807
02:44:52,770 --> 02:45:00,000
They ain't even real.

1808
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:09,379
Look at banquet TV dinner meal.

1809
02:45:09,379 --> 02:45:12,989
Get up.

1810
02:45:12,989 --> 02:45:13,989
Okay.

1811
02:45:13,989 --> 02:45:14,989
I got it already.

1812
02:45:14,989 --> 02:45:15,989
Get up.

1813
02:45:15,989 --> 02:45:16,989
I am standing.

1814
02:45:16,989 --> 02:45:17,989
Go upstairs.

1815
02:45:17,989 --> 02:45:18,989
The second floor.

1816
02:45:18,989 --> 02:45:19,989
Okay.

1817
02:45:19,989 --> 02:45:22,190
No.

1818
02:45:22,190 --> 02:45:23,500
Don't.

1819
02:45:23,500 --> 02:45:25,629
Hello.

1820
02:45:25,629 --> 02:45:27,059
Bathroom.

1821
02:45:27,059 --> 02:45:28,059
The bathroom.

1822
02:45:28,059 --> 02:45:29,059
Run.

1823
02:45:29,059 --> 02:45:35,489
Yes.

1824
02:45:35,489 --> 02:45:36,489
Dead person in the bathtub.

1825
02:45:36,489 --> 02:45:38,370
What?

1826
02:45:38,370 --> 02:45:39,370
Oh my God.

1827
02:45:39,370 --> 02:45:40,370
They must be the guest couple.

1828
02:45:40,370 --> 02:45:50,120
Looks like they tried to hide in here.

1829
02:45:50,120 --> 02:45:51,120
I can't bear to look.

1830
02:45:51,120 --> 02:45:52,120
Why are they carrying...

1831
02:45:52,120 --> 02:45:54,120
Let's check somewhere else.

1832
02:45:54,120 --> 02:45:55,120
Yeah, I know.

1833
02:45:55,120 --> 02:45:56,120
Get in bath.

1834
02:45:56,120 --> 02:45:57,120
The bathroom.

1835
02:45:57,120 --> 02:45:58,120
Okay.

1836
02:45:58,120 --> 02:46:00,489
I can't bear to look.

1837
02:46:00,489 --> 02:46:01,489
Let's check somewhere else.

1838
02:46:01,489 --> 02:46:03,620
There's nothing in there?

1839
02:46:03,620 --> 02:46:07,979
Nothing at all.

1840
02:46:07,979 --> 02:46:12,110
There's nothing in the bathtub or the bathroom.

1841
02:46:12,110 --> 02:46:13,110
Go upstairs.

1842
02:46:13,110 --> 02:46:14,110
The second floor.

1843
02:46:14,110 --> 02:46:15,110
Run.

1844
02:46:15,110 --> 02:46:17,180
Okay.

1845
02:46:17,180 --> 02:46:18,180
Yes.

1846
02:46:18,180 --> 02:46:19,180
The mirror's already broken.

1847
02:46:19,180 --> 02:46:20,180
Yeah, I didn't have to do anything.

1848
02:46:20,180 --> 02:46:21,180
It's already shattered for me.

1849
02:46:21,180 --> 02:46:23,180
Maybe a monster's gonna be up here.

1850
02:46:23,180 --> 02:46:28,969
That thing.

1851
02:46:28,969 --> 02:46:30,270
It can't be.

1852
02:46:30,270 --> 02:46:33,600
Who else is up here?

1853
02:46:33,600 --> 02:46:39,299
This dude looks still alive.

1854
02:46:39,299 --> 02:46:40,979
We were too late.

1855
02:46:40,979 --> 02:46:46,950
Operator, I don't think we're gonna get any information from this researcher.

1856
02:46:46,950 --> 02:46:48,950
What couldn't you ask me?

1857
02:46:48,950 --> 02:46:49,950
What?

1858
02:46:49,950 --> 02:46:50,950
Stop, stop.

1859
02:46:50,950 --> 02:46:51,950
Wait a second.

1860
02:46:51,950 --> 02:46:52,950
I'm human.

1861
02:46:52,950 --> 02:46:54,950
Pretending to be dead?

1862
02:46:54,950 --> 02:46:56,510
Hey, I'm sorry.

1863
02:46:56,510 --> 02:46:59,510
I thought that an alien had come in here.

1864
02:46:59,510 --> 02:47:02,510
I don't have any useful weapons, so the only thing I could do was play dead.

1865
02:47:02,510 --> 02:47:05,510
I'm Alan Honda, a researcher.

1866
02:47:05,510 --> 02:47:08,510
Can you maybe lower that gun?

1867
02:47:08,510 --> 02:47:10,510
I'm human.

1868
02:47:11,510 --> 02:47:13,510
Hey, I'll admit to being a little weird.

1869
02:47:13,510 --> 02:47:16,510
First person that says they're human usually isn't.

1870
02:47:16,510 --> 02:47:19,739
Did you just say alien?

1871
02:47:19,739 --> 02:47:20,739
Snake skin alien.

1872
02:47:20,739 --> 02:47:23,489
You really think those were aliens?

1873
02:47:23,489 --> 02:47:24,489
Huh?

1874
02:47:24,489 --> 02:47:28,290
What do you mean by that?

1875
02:47:28,290 --> 02:47:29,290
Well, I get it.

1876
02:47:29,290 --> 02:47:31,290
I see the significance of that question.

1877
02:47:31,290 --> 02:47:36,459
Are you maybe thinking that we screwed up our experiments and made the aliens?

1878
02:47:36,459 --> 02:47:39,459
Oh, that's one of those games.

1879
02:47:39,459 --> 02:47:41,959
Oh, for Pete's sake.

1880
02:47:41,959 --> 02:47:49,139
You think I like going to the children's department in the store and buying the

1881
02:47:49,139 --> 02:47:50,139
kid's vest?

1882
02:47:50,139 --> 02:47:51,139
No.

1883
02:47:51,139 --> 02:47:53,139
But I do it anyway.

1884
02:48:19,139 --> 02:48:25,139
If you're so interested in our research, I'll give you some reference material.

1885
02:48:25,139 --> 02:48:31,780
That was a gun.

1886
02:48:31,780 --> 02:48:34,780
You ran into that spider, right?

1887
02:48:34,780 --> 02:48:35,780
Uh huh.

1888
02:48:35,780 --> 02:48:37,780
How did you get away from it?

1889
02:48:37,780 --> 02:48:40,209
Please tell me.

1890
02:48:40,209 --> 02:48:43,860
How to kill the spider.

1891
02:48:43,860 --> 02:48:45,860
With that?

1892
02:48:45,860 --> 02:48:46,860
But it's out of fuel now.

1893
02:48:46,860 --> 02:48:47,860
New weapon?

1894
02:48:47,860 --> 02:48:48,860
Is it a flamethrower?

1895
02:48:48,860 --> 02:48:49,860
That thing is huge.

1896
02:48:49,860 --> 02:48:50,860
Do I get to flamethrow mirrors now?

1897
02:48:50,860 --> 02:48:53,860
But it seems to share similarities with Earth's arthropod, a spider.

1898
02:48:53,860 --> 02:48:55,860
You scared it off with fire.

1899
02:48:55,860 --> 02:48:58,860
So it's vulnerable against fire.

1900
02:48:58,860 --> 02:48:59,860
Uh huh.

1901
02:48:59,860 --> 02:49:02,860
Until help arrives, I'm holing up in here.

1902
02:49:02,860 --> 02:49:06,860
Earlier, Research Supervisor Powers sent a rescue signal.

1903
02:49:06,860 --> 02:49:11,860
Powers told me to spread the word, so I came to tell the others, but...

1904
02:49:11,860 --> 02:49:17,030
Because of that monster spider, you can't make it to the receiving port?

1905
02:49:17,030 --> 02:49:18,030
Bingo.

1906
02:49:18,030 --> 02:49:20,030
It's a nasty obstacle.

1907
02:49:20,030 --> 02:49:22,030
So, uh, how about it?

1908
02:49:22,030 --> 02:49:24,030
Wanna play dead with me?

1909
02:49:24,030 --> 02:49:25,030
I'm going.

1910
02:49:25,030 --> 02:49:28,030
I have a partner backing me up.

1911
02:49:28,030 --> 02:49:29,030
Right?

1912
02:49:29,030 --> 02:49:33,030
Whoa, hang on.

1913
02:49:33,030 --> 02:49:35,030
Take this with you.

1914
02:49:35,030 --> 02:49:39,260
Shutter key.

1915
02:49:39,260 --> 02:49:43,479
Do you really intend to just play dead?

1916
02:49:43,479 --> 02:49:47,229
Please refrain from talking to me.

1917
02:49:47,229 --> 02:49:49,229
Okay, whatever.

1918
02:49:49,229 --> 02:49:53,559
The Research Supervisor really sent for help.

1919
02:49:53,559 --> 02:49:56,559
I guess the rescue team is already on the way.

1920
02:49:58,379 --> 02:50:01,379
That means everyone will gather in the receiving port.

1921
02:50:01,379 --> 02:50:03,430
What the fu-

1922
02:50:03,430 --> 02:50:05,430
Gino said that he'd tell the others.

1923
02:50:05,430 --> 02:50:08,430
Both Helen and Naomi may be at the receiving port.

1924
02:50:08,430 --> 02:50:13,139
I think we should be making our way to the receiving port too.

1925
02:50:13,139 --> 02:50:15,139
How many times can you say receiving port in the same?

1926
02:50:15,139 --> 02:50:18,139
We have to get rid of that monster spider if I'm gonna get to the receiving port.

1927
02:50:18,139 --> 02:50:19,139
There's five.

1928
02:50:19,139 --> 02:50:21,139
That flamethrower Alan had.

1929
02:50:21,139 --> 02:50:23,139
It came from the equipment room.

1930
02:50:23,139 --> 02:50:25,139
There should be more at the same.

1931
02:50:25,139 --> 02:50:26,139
Yep.

1932
02:50:26,139 --> 02:50:28,139
I think we better check out the equipment room.

1933
02:50:28,139 --> 02:50:30,450
To the receiving port.

1934
02:50:30,450 --> 02:50:31,450
Oh no, you changed it to equipment room.

1935
02:50:31,450 --> 02:50:32,450
Alright.

1936
02:50:32,450 --> 02:50:37,540
Looks like we have to go to the equipment room.

1937
02:50:37,540 --> 02:50:38,540
Leave.

1938
02:50:38,540 --> 02:50:39,540
Yes.

1939
02:50:39,540 --> 02:50:40,540
Run.

1940
02:50:40,540 --> 02:50:41,540
Yes.

1941
02:50:41,540 --> 02:50:42,540
Leave.

1942
02:50:42,540 --> 02:50:43,540
Hallway.

1943
02:50:43,540 --> 02:50:44,540
Okay.

1944
02:50:44,540 --> 02:50:46,299
I'll leave.

1945
02:50:46,299 --> 02:50:47,299
Save point.

1946
02:50:47,299 --> 02:50:48,299
The save point.

1947
02:50:48,299 --> 02:50:49,299
Run.

1948
02:50:49,299 --> 02:50:53,420
Okay.

1949
02:50:53,420 --> 02:50:54,420
Yes.

1950
02:50:54,420 --> 02:50:55,420
Do I have a key?

1951
02:50:55,420 --> 02:51:05,100
I don't think I have one of those door opening keys.

1952
02:51:05,100 --> 02:51:23,069
Oh, it gave one to me.

1953
02:51:23,069 --> 02:51:24,069
I am stopped.

1954
02:51:24,069 --> 02:51:27,299
Up.

1955
02:51:27,299 --> 02:51:28,299
The bed.

1956
02:51:28,299 --> 02:51:30,879
Hallway.

1957
02:51:30,879 --> 02:51:31,879
Okay.

1958
02:51:31,879 --> 02:51:32,879
Run.

1959
02:51:32,879 --> 02:51:49,290
Yes.

1960
02:51:49,290 --> 02:51:50,290
Where should I go?

1961
02:51:50,290 --> 02:51:53,229
You need to go to the equipment.

1962
02:51:53,229 --> 02:51:54,229
Alright.

1963
02:51:54,229 --> 02:51:55,229
Shutter two.

1964
02:51:55,229 --> 02:51:56,409
Shutter two.

1965
02:51:56,409 --> 02:51:57,409
Okay.

1966
02:51:57,409 --> 02:51:58,409
Run.

1967
02:51:58,409 --> 02:51:59,969
Run.

1968
02:51:59,969 --> 02:52:11,450
Yes.

1969
02:52:11,450 --> 02:52:13,649
Alright.

1970
02:52:13,649 --> 02:52:14,649
Equipment room.

1971
02:52:14,649 --> 02:52:15,649
This will open that shutter.

1972
02:52:15,649 --> 02:52:16,649
Activate the flamethrower.

1973
02:52:16,649 --> 02:52:17,649
Flamethrow the spider.

1974
02:52:17,649 --> 02:52:18,649
We have to analyze.

1975
02:52:18,649 --> 02:52:20,909
Geez.

1976
02:52:20,909 --> 02:52:23,690
Pushy.

1977
02:52:23,690 --> 02:52:24,690
And then two.

1978
02:52:24,690 --> 02:52:31,850
There should be a flamethrower in the equipment room.

1979
02:52:31,850 --> 02:52:33,090
Check.

1980
02:52:33,090 --> 02:52:35,610
Hey.

1981
02:52:35,610 --> 02:52:36,610
Wait, wait, hey.

1982
02:52:36,610 --> 02:52:38,360
I didn't tell you to do that.

1983
02:52:38,360 --> 02:52:40,360
Since when do you make decisions on your own?

1984
02:52:40,360 --> 02:52:44,159
It's getting dark.

1985
02:52:44,159 --> 02:52:46,590
The power must be weakening.

1986
02:52:46,590 --> 02:52:52,030
We always confer with each other.

1987
02:52:52,030 --> 02:52:55,030
A flamethrower would be in the mechanical unit.

1988
02:52:55,030 --> 02:52:58,100
Where was that camera?

1989
02:52:58,100 --> 02:52:59,100
Great.

1990
02:52:59,100 --> 02:53:00,100
Hopefully there's some fuel left.

1991
02:53:00,100 --> 02:53:01,100
Did you see that crane shot?

1992
02:53:01,100 --> 02:53:02,100
Where was she looking?

1993
02:53:02,100 --> 02:53:03,100
What camera was that?

1994
02:53:03,100 --> 02:53:04,790
Huh?

1995
02:53:04,790 --> 02:53:05,790
No fuel?

1996
02:53:05,790 --> 02:53:07,790
Oh man, it's completely empty.

1997
02:53:07,790 --> 02:53:11,569
This won't do.

1998
02:53:11,569 --> 02:53:14,059
Am I like a floating little robot?

1999
02:53:14,059 --> 02:53:15,370
Listen.

2000
02:53:15,370 --> 02:53:17,120
See?

2001
02:53:17,120 --> 02:53:22,750
I think we have to give up on that flamethrower.

2002
02:53:22,750 --> 02:53:23,750
There's no fuel.

2003
02:53:23,750 --> 02:53:25,750
The tank is empty.

2004
02:53:25,750 --> 02:53:27,750
There's nothing we can do.

2005
02:53:27,750 --> 02:53:34,500
To get to the other side of that shutter, we have to kill that spider.

2006
02:53:34,500 --> 02:53:38,500
The flamethrower that Alan had been using is worthless now.

2007
02:53:38,500 --> 02:53:39,799
What?

2008
02:53:39,799 --> 02:53:42,799
That giant spider is vulnerable to fire.

2009
02:53:42,799 --> 02:53:47,129
Let's look for a weapon that involves fire.

2010
02:53:47,129 --> 02:53:48,129
You mean a flamethrower?

2011
02:53:48,129 --> 02:53:49,129
That's the only thing we can do.

2012
02:53:49,129 --> 02:53:52,129
Did they just not want to develop the fire coming out of the flamethrower?

2013
02:53:52,129 --> 02:54:01,739
Hey, what's an item that uses fire and can do fire damage?

2014
02:54:01,739 --> 02:54:02,739
A flamethrower.

2015
02:54:02,739 --> 02:54:03,739
Well, you know, but we can't use that.

2016
02:54:03,739 --> 02:54:05,739
So what else does fire?

2017
02:54:05,739 --> 02:54:06,739
I don't know.

2018
02:54:06,739 --> 02:54:07,739
A fire?

2019
02:54:07,739 --> 02:54:09,739
Start a fire.

2020
02:54:09,739 --> 02:54:11,180
Where are you going?

2021
02:54:11,180 --> 02:54:12,180
Supply unit.

2022
02:54:12,180 --> 02:54:13,180
The supply unit.

2023
02:54:13,180 --> 02:54:14,180
Okay.

2024
02:54:14,180 --> 02:54:17,399
God.

2025
02:54:17,399 --> 02:54:19,280
Left boxes.

2026
02:54:19,280 --> 02:54:20,280
Check.

2027
02:54:20,280 --> 02:54:24,309
These are ventilation fan parts.

2028
02:54:24,309 --> 02:54:31,540
Item on top of the shelf.

2029
02:54:31,540 --> 02:54:34,540
Have you forgotten that I work here?

2030
02:54:34,540 --> 02:54:37,540
Don't expect me to go shooting the hotel's supplies.

2031
02:54:37,540 --> 02:54:42,379
Selective shooting for some reason.

2032
02:54:42,379 --> 02:54:44,379
Item on left shelf.

2033
02:54:44,379 --> 02:54:47,379
Have you forgotten that I work here?

2034
02:54:47,379 --> 02:54:50,379
Don't expect me to go shooting the hotel's supplies.

2035
02:54:50,379 --> 02:54:54,540
Get on scaffolding.

2036
02:54:54,540 --> 02:54:55,540
Geez.

2037
02:54:55,540 --> 02:54:58,540
You're expecting me to pick up everything, aren't you?

2038
02:54:58,540 --> 02:54:59,540
No way.

2039
02:54:59,540 --> 02:55:00,540
I can't pick that up.

2040
02:55:00,540 --> 02:55:06,569
Get on the...

2041
02:55:06,569 --> 02:55:07,569
Okay.

2042
02:55:07,569 --> 02:55:08,569
Thank you.

2043
02:55:08,569 --> 02:55:09,569
Let's check what's up top.

2044
02:55:09,569 --> 02:55:10,569
Okay, you've got the controls.

2045
02:55:10,569 --> 02:55:17,440
Up we go.

2046
02:55:17,440 --> 02:55:39,030
That would hurt.

2047
02:55:39,030 --> 02:55:42,030
That would hurt really bad.

2048
02:55:42,030 --> 02:55:48,920
Smashed her head against the ceiling.

2049
02:55:48,920 --> 02:55:50,219
All right.

2050
02:55:50,219 --> 02:55:51,219
What am I looking for?

2051
02:55:51,219 --> 02:55:52,219
I said the middle shelf is suspicious.

2052
02:55:52,219 --> 02:55:58,059
Wait.

2053
02:55:58,059 --> 02:56:01,059
There's something suspicious about that shelf I just passed.

2054
02:56:01,059 --> 02:56:02,059
Stay there.

2055
02:56:02,059 --> 02:56:03,059
Stop.

2056
02:56:03,059 --> 02:56:04,059
I'm not doing anything.

2057
02:56:04,059 --> 02:56:05,360
I said the middle shelf is suspicious.

2058
02:56:05,360 --> 02:56:06,360
Oh my God.

2059
02:56:06,360 --> 02:56:07,360
I'm not doing anything.

2060
02:56:07,360 --> 02:56:12,569
I swear to God.

2061
02:56:12,569 --> 02:56:14,639
Stop.

2062
02:56:14,639 --> 02:56:15,639
The middle shelf is...

2063
02:56:15,639 --> 02:56:16,639
I can't stop at the middle shelf.

2064
02:56:16,639 --> 02:56:27,729
This lift is scary, so don't say anything weird, please.

2065
02:56:31,659 --> 02:56:32,659
Press enter.

2066
02:56:32,659 --> 02:56:39,120
This lift is scary, so don't say anything weird, please.

2067
02:56:39,120 --> 02:56:40,120
Enter.

2068
02:56:40,120 --> 02:56:41,120
Okay.

2069
02:56:41,120 --> 02:56:48,030
Then lower the lift.

2070
02:56:48,030 --> 02:56:51,030
This lift is scary, so don't say anything weird, please.

2071
02:56:51,030 --> 02:56:52,030
I did.

2072
02:56:52,030 --> 02:56:53,030
I'm sorry.

2073
02:56:53,030 --> 02:56:54,590
Get off.

2074
02:56:54,590 --> 02:56:55,590
Look.

2075
02:56:55,590 --> 02:56:56,590
Forward.

2076
02:56:56,590 --> 02:56:59,590
This lift is scary, so don't say anything weird, please.

2077
02:56:59,590 --> 02:57:00,590
Check.

2078
02:57:00,590 --> 02:57:07,120
There's nothing on the shelf that we can use for lighting a fire.

2079
02:57:07,120 --> 02:57:08,120
Whoa.

2080
02:57:08,120 --> 02:57:09,120
You did it again.

2081
02:57:09,120 --> 02:57:10,120
Take it easy.

2082
02:57:10,120 --> 02:57:11,120
Whoa.

2083
02:57:11,120 --> 02:57:12,120
That was too close.

2084
02:57:12,120 --> 02:57:13,120
Control it better.

2085
02:57:13,120 --> 02:57:14,120
I can't go right.

2086
02:57:14,120 --> 02:57:15,120
Why not?

2087
02:57:15,120 --> 02:57:16,120
Whoa.

2088
02:57:16,120 --> 02:57:17,120
I did it again.

2089
02:57:17,120 --> 02:57:18,120
Take it easy.

2090
02:57:18,120 --> 02:57:37,090
Check.

2091
02:57:37,090 --> 02:57:47,840
I looked carefully, but there's nothing here that we need.

2092
02:57:47,840 --> 02:57:48,840
Nothing?

2093
02:57:48,840 --> 02:57:50,780
Check.

2094
02:57:50,780 --> 02:58:00,959
There's nothing on the shelf that we can use for lighting a fire.

2095
02:58:00,959 --> 02:58:01,959
Listen.

2096
02:58:01,959 --> 02:58:02,959
Listen.

2097
02:58:02,959 --> 02:58:07,959
I know you probably don't get this, but I can't put you in the middle.

2098
02:58:07,959 --> 02:58:10,959
For some reason, it won't let me.

2099
02:58:10,959 --> 02:58:12,139
The utility unit.

2100
02:58:12,139 --> 02:58:13,139
Okay.

2101
02:58:13,139 --> 02:58:20,010
Stop.

2102
02:58:20,010 --> 02:58:21,010
Yes.

2103
02:58:21,010 --> 02:58:22,379
Go back to supply unit.

2104
02:58:22,379 --> 02:58:23,379
The supply unit.

2105
02:58:23,379 --> 02:58:24,379
Run.

2106
02:58:24,379 --> 02:58:25,379
Okay.

2107
02:58:25,379 --> 02:58:28,920
I am running.

2108
02:58:28,920 --> 02:58:30,159
So this...

2109
02:58:30,159 --> 02:58:31,159
Get on.

2110
02:58:31,159 --> 02:58:32,159
Okay.

2111
02:58:32,159 --> 02:58:33,159
Let's check what's up top.

2112
02:58:33,159 --> 02:58:34,159
Okay.

2113
02:58:34,159 --> 02:58:35,159
You've got the controls.

2114
02:58:35,159 --> 02:58:52,899
Jump.

2115
02:58:52,899 --> 02:58:53,899
You would think I could just go this way from here.

2116
02:58:53,899 --> 02:58:54,899
Whoa.

2117
02:58:54,899 --> 02:58:55,899
That was too close.

2118
02:58:55,899 --> 02:58:56,899
Control it better.

2119
02:58:56,899 --> 02:58:57,899
Use.

2120
02:58:57,899 --> 02:59:07,579
Check.

2121
02:59:07,579 --> 02:59:08,579
Check.

2122
02:59:08,579 --> 02:59:09,579
Check.

2123
02:59:09,579 --> 02:59:12,420
Check.

2124
02:59:12,420 --> 02:59:14,430
I can't.

2125
02:59:14,430 --> 02:59:17,430
I can't check a shelf properly unless I'm squarely in front of it.

2126
02:59:17,430 --> 02:59:18,430
Use the X button?

2127
02:59:18,430 --> 02:59:20,059
No.

2128
02:59:20,059 --> 02:59:25,389
Enter doesn't do anything.

2129
02:59:25,389 --> 02:59:26,389
There is no, like, enter.

2130
02:59:26,389 --> 02:59:27,819
Wait.

2131
02:59:27,819 --> 02:59:31,260
There's something suspicious about that shelf I just passed.

2132
02:59:31,260 --> 02:59:32,260
Go diagonal.

2133
02:59:32,260 --> 02:59:33,260
Try from the left again.

2134
02:59:33,260 --> 02:59:34,260
That was too close.

2135
02:59:34,260 --> 02:59:46,629
Control it better.

2136
02:59:46,629 --> 02:59:55,229
Can I do this?

2137
02:59:55,229 --> 02:59:56,229
Enter on the PlayStation 2 controller is...

2138
02:59:56,229 --> 03:00:11,870
What, though?

2139
03:00:11,870 --> 03:00:12,870
Does none of these buttons do anything?

2140
03:00:12,870 --> 03:00:13,870
Circle is talk.

2141
03:00:13,870 --> 03:00:30,440
I can't check a shelf properly unless I'm squarely in front of it.

2142
03:00:31,440 --> 03:00:32,440
Diagonally?

2143
03:00:32,440 --> 03:00:39,059
Okay.

2144
03:00:39,059 --> 03:00:46,860
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.

2145
03:00:46,860 --> 03:00:47,860
What?

2146
03:00:47,860 --> 03:00:49,930
No way that that works.

2147
03:00:49,930 --> 03:00:51,930
There's no way that that works.

2148
03:00:51,930 --> 03:00:56,469
Are you serious?

2149
03:00:56,469 --> 03:01:10,360
Come on.

2150
03:01:10,360 --> 03:01:17,180
It actually fucking works.

2151
03:01:17,180 --> 03:01:18,180
How...

2152
03:01:18,180 --> 03:01:24,180
There's no way I would have been able to ever assume that I could go diagonal.

2153
03:01:24,180 --> 03:01:25,180
I've got four.

2154
03:01:25,180 --> 03:01:30,979
One, two, three, four.

2155
03:01:30,979 --> 03:01:33,379
Check.

2156
03:01:33,379 --> 03:01:36,379
There's nothing on the shelf that we can use for lighting a fire.

2157
03:01:36,379 --> 03:01:42,120
I can't believe it.

2158
03:01:42,120 --> 03:01:43,739
Check.

2159
03:01:43,739 --> 03:01:44,739
That's unbelievable.

2160
03:01:44,739 --> 03:01:45,739
This magnesium chip.

2161
03:01:45,739 --> 03:01:48,139
Let's see.

2162
03:01:48,139 --> 03:01:49,139
What does it say?

2163
03:01:49,139 --> 03:01:52,139
Warnings for magnesium chip usage.

2164
03:01:52,139 --> 03:01:55,569
One, keep out of reach of children.

2165
03:01:55,569 --> 03:02:00,569
Two, avoid direct sunlight and temperature over 50 degrees Celsius.

2166
03:02:00,569 --> 03:02:02,569
Do not incinerate.

2167
03:02:02,569 --> 03:02:08,569
Three, hold away from face while igniting and confirm that it is extinguished.

2168
03:02:08,569 --> 03:02:11,569
Four, that's enough, huh?

2169
03:02:11,569 --> 03:02:13,569
In other words, it's like a lighter.

2170
03:02:13,569 --> 03:02:16,569
It won't make a weapon, but I can use it for lighting a fire.

2171
03:02:16,569 --> 03:02:18,569
So throw that.

2172
03:02:18,569 --> 03:02:20,569
What the hell is that thing called?

2173
03:02:20,569 --> 03:02:22,379
Magnesium.

2174
03:02:22,379 --> 03:02:23,379
I got the magnesium.

2175
03:02:23,379 --> 03:02:26,989
Off.

2176
03:02:26,989 --> 03:02:31,680
I can't check a shelf properly unless I'm squarely in front of it.

2177
03:02:31,680 --> 03:02:34,239
Get off.

2178
03:02:34,239 --> 03:02:35,239
Off.

2179
03:02:35,239 --> 03:02:37,239
Yes, maybe we should go somewhere else.

2180
03:02:37,239 --> 03:02:41,629
So I'm going to say throw magnesium at Spider.

2181
03:02:41,629 --> 03:02:43,629
So we got supply unit, food unit.

2182
03:02:43,629 --> 03:02:44,629
The food unit.

2183
03:02:44,629 --> 03:02:45,629
OK.

2184
03:02:45,629 --> 03:02:48,920
Run.

2185
03:02:48,920 --> 03:02:49,920
Yes.

2186
03:02:49,920 --> 03:02:59,139
This is another one of these dumb scaffolding puzzles.

2187
03:02:59,139 --> 03:03:01,139
This unit only has preserved food.

2188
03:03:01,139 --> 03:03:03,139
There's no need to check this.

2189
03:03:03,139 --> 03:03:04,139
Let's go.

2190
03:03:04,139 --> 03:03:05,819
OK.

2191
03:03:05,819 --> 03:03:09,090
It's apparently that easy.

2192
03:03:09,090 --> 03:03:10,090
Mechanical unit.

2193
03:03:10,090 --> 03:03:11,090
The mechanical unit.

2194
03:03:11,090 --> 03:03:12,090
OK.

2195
03:03:12,090 --> 03:03:15,819
Run.

2196
03:03:15,819 --> 03:03:18,979
Yes.

2197
03:03:18,979 --> 03:03:19,979
Oh, no.

2198
03:03:19,979 --> 03:03:28,590
Time thrower, shelf, shelf, power panel, out of order.

2199
03:03:28,590 --> 03:03:29,590
Fix power panel.

2200
03:03:29,590 --> 03:03:34,879
I'd feel bad if I were to wreck this anymore.

2201
03:03:34,879 --> 03:03:35,879
Utility unit.

2202
03:03:35,879 --> 03:03:36,879
Utility unit.

2203
03:03:36,879 --> 03:03:37,879
Run.

2204
03:03:37,879 --> 03:03:38,879
I gotcha.

2205
03:03:38,879 --> 03:03:43,870
The shelf on the other side.

2206
03:03:43,870 --> 03:03:44,870
Run.

2207
03:03:44,870 --> 03:03:51,360
Yes.

2208
03:03:51,360 --> 03:03:52,600
Get on.

2209
03:03:52,600 --> 03:03:53,600
OK.

2210
03:03:53,600 --> 03:03:54,600
Let's check what's up top.

2211
03:03:54,600 --> 03:03:55,600
OK.

2212
03:03:55,600 --> 03:03:59,399
You've got the controls.

2213
03:03:59,399 --> 03:04:04,610
Do I?

2214
03:04:04,610 --> 03:04:08,409
I do.

2215
03:04:08,409 --> 03:04:09,409
Voltage at 50%.

2216
03:04:09,409 --> 03:04:10,409
The power supply is unstable.

2217
03:04:10,409 --> 03:04:12,409
Please raise the voltage to 100.

2218
03:04:33,020 --> 03:04:34,020
I can't go anywhere.

2219
03:04:34,020 --> 03:04:35,020
I think I have to raise the power.

2220
03:04:52,459 --> 03:04:53,459
Nothing works.

2221
03:04:56,319 --> 03:04:57,319
Check.

2222
03:04:57,319 --> 03:05:00,620
If you want me to check the lower shelves, I won't need the lift.

2223
03:05:00,620 --> 03:05:02,620
So how is this even possible?

2224
03:05:05,770 --> 03:05:06,770
I mean, top?

2225
03:05:06,770 --> 03:05:07,770
From here?

2226
03:05:07,770 --> 03:05:08,770
No.

2227
03:05:08,770 --> 03:05:09,770
From here?

2228
03:05:09,770 --> 03:05:10,770
No.

2229
03:05:10,770 --> 03:05:11,770
I gotta get off.

2230
03:05:11,770 --> 03:05:12,770
Get off.

2231
03:05:12,770 --> 03:05:13,770
Yes.

2232
03:05:13,770 --> 03:05:14,770
I think we should go somewhere else.

2233
03:05:16,709 --> 03:05:22,219
Turn the other one off.

2234
03:05:22,219 --> 03:05:26,459
Supply unit.

2235
03:05:26,459 --> 03:05:27,459
The supply unit.

2236
03:05:27,459 --> 03:05:28,459
OK.

2237
03:05:28,459 --> 03:05:37,680
Maybe that'll defer power?

2238
03:05:38,680 --> 03:05:40,690
Utility unit.

2239
03:05:40,690 --> 03:05:41,930
Utility unit.

2240
03:05:42,930 --> 03:05:43,930
I gotcha.

2241
03:05:43,930 --> 03:05:44,930
Run.

2242
03:05:44,930 --> 03:05:45,930
The shelf on the other side.

2243
03:05:45,930 --> 03:05:47,739
Run.

2244
03:05:47,739 --> 03:05:48,739
Run.

2245
03:05:48,739 --> 03:05:49,739
Yes.

2246
03:05:49,739 --> 03:05:59,979
Did it say the power?

2247
03:05:59,979 --> 03:06:01,290
Get on.

2248
03:06:01,290 --> 03:06:02,850
OK.

2249
03:06:02,850 --> 03:06:04,850
Let's check what's up top.

2250
03:06:04,850 --> 03:06:05,850
OK.

2251
03:06:05,850 --> 03:06:06,850
You've got the controls.

2252
03:06:06,850 --> 03:06:08,409
I wonder if that worked.

2253
03:06:08,409 --> 03:06:13,549
Yeah.

2254
03:06:13,549 --> 03:06:14,549
It did.

2255
03:06:14,549 --> 03:06:16,299
Wow.

2256
03:06:16,299 --> 03:06:18,860
It's pretty remarkable actually.

2257
03:06:18,860 --> 03:06:19,860
Check.

2258
03:06:19,860 --> 03:06:21,040
This.

2259
03:06:21,040 --> 03:06:23,299
It's a chip.

2260
03:06:23,299 --> 03:06:27,620
It's pretty sweet.

2261
03:06:27,620 --> 03:06:31,930
Check.

2262
03:06:31,930 --> 03:06:36,260
I looked carefully, but there's nothing here that we need.

2263
03:06:38,969 --> 03:06:41,909
Running to a wall here.

2264
03:06:41,909 --> 03:06:44,299
Nothing else?

2265
03:06:44,299 --> 03:06:45,299
Check.

2266
03:06:45,299 --> 03:06:49,569
There's nothing on the shelf that we can use for lighting a fire.

2267
03:06:50,569 --> 03:06:52,000
I think that's it.

2268
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:53,000
Jesus.

2269
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:54,000
That was too close.

2270
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:55,000
Control it better.

2271
03:06:55,000 --> 03:07:02,000
Get off.

2272
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:03,000
Yes.

2273
03:07:03,000 --> 03:07:04,000
Maybe we should go somewhere else.

2274
03:07:06,200 --> 03:07:08,200
So that was data unit.

2275
03:07:08,200 --> 03:07:09,200
Data unit.

2276
03:07:09,200 --> 03:07:10,200
The data unit.

2277
03:07:10,200 --> 03:07:11,200
OK.

2278
03:07:11,200 --> 03:07:12,200
Run.

2279
03:07:12,200 --> 03:07:13,200
Yes.

2280
03:07:16,620 --> 03:07:18,239
Check note.

2281
03:07:18,239 --> 03:07:20,950
What is this?

2282
03:07:20,950 --> 03:07:21,950
Oh, that's the...

2283
03:07:21,950 --> 03:07:22,950
This diagram.

2284
03:07:22,950 --> 03:07:23,950
That's the thing that describes...

2285
03:07:23,950 --> 03:07:25,950
Is it just some doodling by the staff?

2286
03:07:25,950 --> 03:07:27,950
That's the solution to the puzzle.

2287
03:07:27,950 --> 03:07:31,500
OK.

2288
03:07:31,500 --> 03:07:32,500
That's great.

2289
03:07:32,500 --> 03:07:36,229
Look at left.

2290
03:07:36,229 --> 03:07:39,229
How am I supposed to understand that?

2291
03:07:39,229 --> 03:07:41,750
What is that thing?

2292
03:07:41,750 --> 03:07:42,750
Look at dolly.

2293
03:07:42,750 --> 03:07:43,750
Leave the room?

2294
03:07:43,750 --> 03:07:44,750
No.

2295
03:07:44,750 --> 03:07:45,750
OK.

2296
03:07:45,750 --> 03:07:47,059
Stop.

2297
03:07:47,059 --> 03:07:48,870
Go back.

2298
03:07:48,870 --> 03:07:49,870
Stop.

2299
03:07:49,870 --> 03:07:50,870
Yep.

2300
03:07:50,870 --> 03:07:51,870
Go to data panel.

2301
03:07:51,870 --> 03:07:52,870
The data unit.

2302
03:07:52,870 --> 03:07:53,870
OK.

2303
03:07:53,870 --> 03:07:57,010
Check left panel.

2304
03:07:57,010 --> 03:08:01,000
No go.

2305
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:04,000
It's not working properly because it's not getting enough power.

2306
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:08,750
If this was working properly, it would have been easy to check this room.

2307
03:08:10,440 --> 03:08:14,430
OK.

2308
03:08:14,430 --> 03:08:17,040
Look at platform.

2309
03:08:17,040 --> 03:08:21,370
It's a cart for delivering supplies to various sections.

2310
03:08:21,370 --> 03:08:23,370
It's for staff use.

2311
03:08:23,370 --> 03:08:25,950
That's it.

2312
03:08:25,950 --> 03:08:26,950
All right.

2313
03:08:26,950 --> 03:08:27,950
I think we can get out of here.

2314
03:08:27,950 --> 03:08:28,950
Safe point.

2315
03:08:28,950 --> 03:08:29,950
OK.

2316
03:08:29,950 --> 03:08:30,950
The safe point.

2317
03:08:30,950 --> 03:08:33,280
We got the fire.

2318
03:08:33,280 --> 03:08:34,280
We can kill the bug.

2319
03:08:34,280 --> 03:08:35,280
I am walking.

2320
03:08:35,280 --> 03:08:41,059
Mine Bitcoin.

2321
03:08:41,059 --> 03:08:42,059
I'm not going to say that.

2322
03:08:42,059 --> 03:08:49,959
Get up.

2323
03:08:49,959 --> 03:08:55,170
OK.

2324
03:08:55,170 --> 03:08:56,170
I got it already.

2325
03:08:56,170 --> 03:08:57,170
Leave.

2326
03:08:57,170 --> 03:09:00,969
Into the hallway.

2327
03:09:00,969 --> 03:09:01,969
OK.

2328
03:09:01,969 --> 03:09:02,969
I'll leave.

2329
03:09:02,969 --> 03:09:03,969
Go.

2330
03:09:03,969 --> 03:09:04,969
Did you say something?

2331
03:09:04,969 --> 03:09:05,969
Hallway.

2332
03:09:05,969 --> 03:09:08,860
OK.

2333
03:09:08,860 --> 03:09:09,860
I'll leave.

2334
03:09:09,860 --> 03:09:10,860
Be nice to her.

2335
03:09:10,860 --> 03:09:11,860
Where should I go?

2336
03:09:11,860 --> 03:09:22,100
Be nice to her.

2337
03:09:22,100 --> 03:09:29,819
So now we go to infirmary.

2338
03:09:29,819 --> 03:09:30,819
The infirmary.

2339
03:09:30,819 --> 03:09:31,819
OK.

2340
03:09:31,819 --> 03:09:46,469
This is the infirmary.

2341
03:09:46,469 --> 03:09:51,059
This is actually the first time I've ever been here.

2342
03:09:51,059 --> 03:09:54,540
Ha ha.

2343
03:09:54,540 --> 03:09:55,540
That'd be funny.

2344
03:09:55,540 --> 03:09:56,540
Ha ha.

2345
03:09:56,540 --> 03:09:57,540
Ha ha.

2346
03:09:57,540 --> 03:09:58,540
What?

2347
03:09:58,540 --> 03:09:59,969
A way to kill that spider.

2348
03:09:59,969 --> 03:10:00,969
I already have it.

2349
03:10:00,969 --> 03:10:01,969
Listen, operator.

2350
03:10:01,969 --> 03:10:05,530
What do you associate with an infirmary?

2351
03:10:05,530 --> 03:10:09,530
Can you name the sorts of things that you'd find in an infirmary?

2352
03:10:09,530 --> 03:10:12,790
Sure.

2353
03:10:12,790 --> 03:10:13,790
Medicine.

2354
03:10:13,790 --> 03:10:15,290
Medicine.

2355
03:10:15,290 --> 03:10:19,530
In a room this big, there should be all sorts.

2356
03:10:19,530 --> 03:10:22,920
Anything else?

2357
03:10:22,920 --> 03:10:25,920
A doctor.

2358
03:10:25,920 --> 03:10:27,290
Yep.

2359
03:10:27,290 --> 03:10:28,290
You bet.

2360
03:10:28,290 --> 03:10:29,290
There'd be a doctor.

2361
03:10:29,290 --> 03:10:30,290
Definitely.

2362
03:10:30,290 --> 03:10:34,000
Are there any others?

2363
03:10:34,000 --> 03:10:37,479
Turkey.

2364
03:10:37,479 --> 03:10:38,479
Thanksgiving turkey.

2365
03:10:38,479 --> 03:10:39,479
Christmas turkey.

2366
03:10:39,479 --> 03:10:44,370
A football.

2367
03:10:44,370 --> 03:10:49,569
Tell me some things you'd find in an infirmary.

2368
03:10:49,569 --> 03:10:51,319
A lawyer.

2369
03:10:51,319 --> 03:10:52,319
Oh.

2370
03:10:52,319 --> 03:10:53,319
Barium.

2371
03:10:53,319 --> 03:10:55,940
I absolutely loathe the idea.

2372
03:10:55,940 --> 03:10:56,940
Did you just say...

2373
03:10:56,940 --> 03:10:58,940
Can't they find a better way to...

2374
03:10:58,940 --> 03:10:59,940
Barium?

2375
03:10:59,940 --> 03:11:00,940
Come on.

2376
03:11:00,940 --> 03:11:01,940
More guesses.

2377
03:11:01,940 --> 03:11:08,879
Barium?

2378
03:11:08,879 --> 03:11:09,879
Surgery tools.

2379
03:11:09,879 --> 03:11:11,250
Uh, yeah.

2380
03:11:11,250 --> 03:11:12,250
Bedpan.

2381
03:11:12,250 --> 03:11:16,639
Are there any more?

2382
03:11:16,639 --> 03:11:18,840
Yes, Dora.

2383
03:11:18,840 --> 03:11:26,930
Let me see.

2384
03:11:26,930 --> 03:11:27,930
Syringes.

2385
03:11:27,930 --> 03:11:29,420
A syringe.

2386
03:11:29,420 --> 03:11:30,420
I hate them.

2387
03:11:30,420 --> 03:11:33,420
Can you manage one more guess?

2388
03:11:33,420 --> 03:11:47,860
Stuff you'd find in an infirmary.

2389
03:11:52,930 --> 03:11:53,930
Alcohol?

2390
03:11:53,930 --> 03:11:55,809
No.

2391
03:11:55,809 --> 03:11:59,809
I mean, alcohol, but not really.

2392
03:11:59,809 --> 03:12:01,299
Alcohol.

2393
03:12:01,299 --> 03:12:02,739
Yeah.

2394
03:12:02,739 --> 03:12:07,360
Disinfectant always stings on cuts or scrapes.

2395
03:12:07,360 --> 03:12:09,979
Yeah, let's see.

2396
03:12:09,979 --> 03:12:14,950
Being a medical room, there should be chemicals here.

2397
03:12:14,950 --> 03:12:19,430
Chemicals.

2398
03:12:19,430 --> 03:12:21,430
A flamethrower.

2399
03:12:21,430 --> 03:12:23,819
Oh.

2400
03:12:23,819 --> 03:12:24,819
Listen, operator.

2401
03:12:24,819 --> 03:12:27,819
There's gotta be a weapon we can use to kill that spider.

2402
03:12:27,819 --> 03:12:29,579
Chemical fire.

2403
03:12:29,579 --> 03:12:31,579
Alright, let's put it together.

2404
03:12:31,579 --> 03:12:33,579
That weapon's name...

2405
03:12:33,579 --> 03:12:35,520
A flamethrower.

2406
03:12:35,520 --> 03:12:36,520
What was it now?

2407
03:12:36,520 --> 03:12:38,520
You don't remember the flamethrower?

2408
03:12:38,520 --> 03:12:41,659
What was its name now?

2409
03:12:41,659 --> 03:12:43,659
I can't talk.

2410
03:12:43,659 --> 03:12:44,659
What was it called?

2411
03:12:44,659 --> 03:12:45,659
That thing.

2412
03:12:45,659 --> 03:12:47,659
I can't remember.

2413
03:12:47,659 --> 03:12:49,409
Hey, operator.

2414
03:12:49,409 --> 03:12:52,409
Can you name some weapons that you know?

2415
03:12:52,409 --> 03:12:55,219
Grenade.

2416
03:12:55,219 --> 03:12:57,219
A grenade or something?

2417
03:12:57,219 --> 03:13:00,909
Would you say the names of other weapons?

2418
03:13:00,909 --> 03:13:01,909
Knife.

2419
03:13:01,909 --> 03:13:03,219
Knife.

2420
03:13:03,219 --> 03:13:04,459
Knife.

2421
03:13:04,459 --> 03:13:05,459
Um...

2422
03:13:05,459 --> 03:13:07,209
You know that, um...

2423
03:13:07,209 --> 03:13:14,180
No, a stick won't do it.

2424
03:13:14,180 --> 03:13:16,180
A stick.

2425
03:13:16,180 --> 03:13:18,180
Yeah, hit it with a stick.

2426
03:13:18,180 --> 03:13:20,180
Hit the monster with a stick.

2427
03:13:20,180 --> 03:13:21,549
No, it won't do it.

2428
03:13:21,549 --> 03:13:22,549
Yes, it will.

2429
03:13:22,549 --> 03:13:24,690
A medicine.

2430
03:13:24,690 --> 03:13:26,120
Yes, that's it.

2431
03:13:26,120 --> 03:13:28,120
A weapon you can make using medicine.

2432
03:13:28,120 --> 03:13:32,979
No, hit it with a stick.

2433
03:13:32,979 --> 03:13:33,979
Uh...

2434
03:13:33,979 --> 03:13:36,059
Flame broiled.

2435
03:13:36,059 --> 03:13:38,059
We had to give up on flamethrowers already.

2436
03:13:38,059 --> 03:13:39,059
Um...

2437
03:13:39,059 --> 03:13:42,129
That weapon that burned...

2438
03:13:42,129 --> 03:13:43,129
A battle axe.

2439
03:13:43,129 --> 03:13:45,940
Was it an axe or something?

2440
03:13:45,940 --> 03:13:47,819
Um...

2441
03:13:47,819 --> 03:13:49,819
That burning weapon, what was it?

2442
03:13:49,819 --> 03:13:50,819
A burning axe.

2443
03:13:50,819 --> 03:13:53,059
That's enough about axes.

2444
03:13:53,059 --> 03:13:54,059
Um...

2445
03:13:54,059 --> 03:13:55,059
An ice enchanted axe.

2446
03:13:55,059 --> 03:13:57,059
That burning weapon, what was it?

2447
03:13:57,059 --> 03:13:59,750
A plus two lightning axe.

2448
03:13:59,750 --> 03:14:02,750
Operator, can you tell me the names of weapons that you know?

2449
03:14:02,750 --> 03:14:03,750
Lightning.

2450
03:14:03,750 --> 03:14:07,139
Lightning spell.

2451
03:14:07,139 --> 03:14:08,139
A taser.

2452
03:14:08,139 --> 03:14:09,139
Um...

2453
03:14:09,139 --> 03:14:11,829
A fiery weapon.

2454
03:14:11,829 --> 03:14:14,709
A fiery weapon.

2455
03:14:14,709 --> 03:14:15,709
Sword.

2456
03:14:15,709 --> 03:14:16,709
A sword.

2457
03:14:16,709 --> 03:14:17,709
Um...

2458
03:14:17,709 --> 03:14:21,079
That's right, a weapon that uses alcohol.

2459
03:14:21,079 --> 03:14:22,079
I didn't say anything.

2460
03:14:22,079 --> 03:14:25,079
It's gonna Luigi me in about five seconds.

2461
03:14:25,079 --> 03:14:27,829
An alcohol coated sword.

2462
03:14:27,829 --> 03:14:29,829
No, a stick won't do it.

2463
03:14:29,829 --> 03:14:30,829
Um...

2464
03:14:30,829 --> 03:14:31,829
An alcohol stick.

2465
03:14:31,829 --> 03:14:34,829
That's right, a weapon that uses alcohol.

2466
03:14:34,829 --> 03:14:39,340
Cannon.

2467
03:14:39,340 --> 03:14:41,579
A cannon.

2468
03:14:41,579 --> 03:14:42,940
Cannon.

2469
03:14:42,940 --> 03:14:45,250
A cannon.

2470
03:14:45,250 --> 03:14:47,250
That's enough about swords.

2471
03:14:47,250 --> 03:14:48,250
Um...

2472
03:14:48,250 --> 03:14:51,579
A weapon that uses alcohol.

2473
03:14:51,579 --> 03:14:52,579
A bomb.

2474
03:14:52,579 --> 03:14:53,579
Handguns and stuff.

2475
03:14:53,579 --> 03:14:54,579
Huh.

2476
03:14:54,579 --> 03:14:55,579
Um...

2477
03:14:55,579 --> 03:15:02,239
A weapon that burns with alcohol.

2478
03:15:02,239 --> 03:15:05,239
I know what it is, but I want to see how many things she knows.

2479
03:15:05,239 --> 03:15:09,270
Molotov cocktail.

2480
03:15:09,270 --> 03:15:10,270
Molotov.

2481
03:15:10,270 --> 03:15:15,350
Sword.

2482
03:15:15,350 --> 03:15:17,350
There should be alcohol in every medical room.

2483
03:15:17,350 --> 03:15:20,350
We'll find some alcohol and make a Molotov cocktail.

2484
03:15:20,350 --> 03:15:23,350
Okay, let's look for some alcohol.

2485
03:15:23,350 --> 03:15:29,350
Imagine how fucking stupid you would sound if I'm an operator sitting in a room by myself

2486
03:15:29,350 --> 03:15:32,350
and this girl is here alone.

2487
03:15:32,350 --> 03:15:35,350
There's all kinds of fucking creatures and monsters and weirdos.

2488
03:15:35,350 --> 03:15:38,350
And she's asking me for help on what they can make for a weapon

2489
03:15:38,350 --> 03:15:40,350
and I'm leaning in going, you should find a sword.

2490
03:15:40,350 --> 03:15:42,350
You should find a sword.

2491
03:15:42,350 --> 03:15:46,360
Like how much of a fucking idiot would you have to be?

2492
03:15:46,360 --> 03:15:52,569
Operating table.

2493
03:15:52,569 --> 03:15:53,569
The operating table.

2494
03:15:53,569 --> 03:15:54,569
Okay.

2495
03:15:54,569 --> 03:15:56,639
A stick.

2496
03:15:56,639 --> 03:15:58,639
Throw a stick at him.

2497
03:15:58,639 --> 03:16:04,909
Operating table.

2498
03:16:04,909 --> 03:16:08,260
Check.

2499
03:16:08,260 --> 03:16:10,020
Huh?

2500
03:16:10,020 --> 03:16:11,020
Sorry.

2501
03:16:11,020 --> 03:16:12,020
It's nothing.

2502
03:16:12,020 --> 03:16:13,020
It's nothing.

2503
03:16:13,020 --> 03:16:15,920
What?

2504
03:16:15,920 --> 03:16:16,920
What are you getting?

2505
03:16:16,920 --> 03:16:17,920
Strong memories.

2506
03:16:17,920 --> 03:16:18,920
Getting some backstory.

2507
03:16:18,920 --> 03:16:26,750
You know what I mean?

2508
03:16:26,750 --> 03:16:27,750
Check machine.

2509
03:16:27,750 --> 03:16:28,750
Oh, sorry.

2510
03:16:28,750 --> 03:16:30,750
Now is not the time to be talking about that.

2511
03:16:30,750 --> 03:16:31,750
How about the machine?

2512
03:16:31,750 --> 03:16:32,750
We're looking for weapons here.

2513
03:16:32,750 --> 03:16:34,750
There doesn't appear to be anything here.

2514
03:16:34,750 --> 03:16:35,750
Come on.

2515
03:16:35,750 --> 03:16:37,750
Let's check somewhere else.

2516
03:16:37,750 --> 03:16:41,979
You are really stupid.

2517
03:16:41,979 --> 03:16:42,979
Okay.

2518
03:16:42,979 --> 03:16:48,350
You are very dumb.

2519
03:16:48,350 --> 03:16:58,299
Yes.

2520
03:16:58,299 --> 03:17:03,620
You are extraordinarily untalented.

2521
03:17:03,620 --> 03:17:04,620
You are dumb.

2522
03:17:04,620 --> 03:17:05,620
Phew.

2523
03:17:05,620 --> 03:17:06,860
You are stupid.

2524
03:17:06,860 --> 03:17:07,860
All right.

2525
03:17:07,860 --> 03:17:08,860
What am I doing?

2526
03:17:08,860 --> 03:17:09,860
Check bed.

2527
03:17:09,860 --> 03:17:10,860
The bed.

2528
03:17:10,860 --> 03:17:11,860
Okay.

2529
03:17:11,860 --> 03:17:14,899
You are very cool.

2530
03:17:14,899 --> 03:17:15,899
Yes.

2531
03:17:15,899 --> 03:17:20,180
It's a bed for resting.

2532
03:17:20,180 --> 03:17:22,180
It doesn't appear to have been used at all.

2533
03:17:22,180 --> 03:17:25,020
That's it?

2534
03:17:25,020 --> 03:17:27,200
There's nothing here.

2535
03:17:27,200 --> 03:17:28,440
Let's look elsewhere.

2536
03:17:28,440 --> 03:17:31,020
There's nothing in the bed.

2537
03:17:31,020 --> 03:17:34,020
Nothing in the operating table.

2538
03:17:34,020 --> 03:17:35,020
Check desk.

2539
03:17:35,020 --> 03:17:36,020
The desk.

2540
03:17:36,020 --> 03:17:41,870
Okay.

2541
03:17:41,870 --> 03:17:43,870
We got some x-rays here.

2542
03:17:43,870 --> 03:17:44,870
Look at the x-rays.

2543
03:17:44,870 --> 03:17:48,010
It's from an employee checkup.

2544
03:17:48,010 --> 03:17:51,819
But to have someone look inside your body.

2545
03:17:51,819 --> 03:17:52,819
Not for me.

2546
03:17:52,819 --> 03:17:53,819
Thanks.

2547
03:17:53,819 --> 03:17:57,790
You're never going to get an x-ray?

2548
03:17:57,790 --> 03:18:03,739
That's really not that smart to say that.

2549
03:18:03,739 --> 03:18:06,739
I fell off my skateboard and I think I might have broke my arm.

2550
03:18:06,739 --> 03:18:09,739
We need to see where the brake is so we can determine if we need to do anything about it.

2551
03:18:09,739 --> 03:18:10,739
No.

2552
03:18:10,739 --> 03:18:11,739
I'm not doing x-rays.

2553
03:18:11,739 --> 03:18:12,739
I'm not doing it.

2554
03:18:12,739 --> 03:18:21,899
Check left drawer.

2555
03:18:21,899 --> 03:18:22,899
Drawer.

2556
03:18:22,899 --> 03:18:25,649
This one, right?

2557
03:18:25,649 --> 03:18:30,280
Oh, nice.

2558
03:18:30,280 --> 03:18:31,280
A collectible card.

2559
03:18:31,280 --> 03:18:34,350
It's a doctor's ID card.

2560
03:18:34,350 --> 03:18:36,680
It looks useful.

2561
03:18:36,680 --> 03:18:43,909
I'll take it.

2562
03:18:43,909 --> 03:18:46,280
We got...

2563
03:18:46,280 --> 03:18:49,459
Take a quick look at the computer monitor on the left.

2564
03:18:49,459 --> 03:18:50,459
The PC?

2565
03:18:50,459 --> 03:18:54,340
I don't know what you're saying.

2566
03:18:54,340 --> 03:18:55,340
The PC.

2567
03:18:55,340 --> 03:18:57,159
There's nothing wrong.

2568
03:18:57,159 --> 03:18:59,159
It's just not turned on.

2569
03:18:59,159 --> 03:19:05,600
Play Fortnite on PC.

2570
03:19:05,600 --> 03:19:06,600
The PC?

2571
03:19:06,600 --> 03:19:09,840
I don't know what you're saying.

2572
03:19:09,840 --> 03:19:10,840
Sorry.

2573
03:19:10,840 --> 03:19:11,840
I was doing it.

2574
03:19:11,840 --> 03:19:18,409
I was making a dumb joke for chat.

2575
03:19:18,409 --> 03:19:20,579
Go look at the books.

2576
03:19:21,579 --> 03:19:25,229
Open medical book.

2577
03:19:31,399 --> 03:19:32,399
It wasn't his own joke.

2578
03:19:32,399 --> 03:19:33,399
No, it wasn't.

2579
03:19:36,520 --> 03:19:37,520
I'm looking at it.

2580
03:19:37,520 --> 03:19:38,520
I'm seeing a lot of HAA.

2581
03:19:38,520 --> 03:19:39,520
Capital HAA.

2582
03:19:43,700 --> 03:19:44,700
I don't like it.

2583
03:19:49,700 --> 03:19:50,700
Nopers.

2584
03:19:50,700 --> 03:19:51,700
Ha ha.

2585
03:19:53,700 --> 03:19:54,700
Ha ha ha.

2586
03:19:54,700 --> 03:19:55,700
Nopers?

2587
03:19:57,700 --> 03:20:00,090
Right?

2588
03:20:00,090 --> 03:20:01,090
Right, guys?

2589
03:20:01,090 --> 03:20:02,649
Open fridge.

2590
03:20:07,420 --> 03:20:09,420
Refrigerated box on the right.

2591
03:20:11,420 --> 03:20:13,239
Glass case.

2592
03:20:15,239 --> 03:20:16,239
No.

2593
03:20:16,239 --> 03:20:18,440
What?

2594
03:20:18,440 --> 03:20:23,559
What the hell am I doing?

2595
03:20:25,559 --> 03:20:26,559
Shoot.

2596
03:20:26,559 --> 03:20:27,559
Here we go.

2597
03:20:27,559 --> 03:20:28,559
This is the perfect...

2598
03:20:28,559 --> 03:20:29,559
Shoot glass.

2599
03:20:31,559 --> 03:20:32,559
Shoot glass.

2600
03:20:32,559 --> 03:20:33,559
Glass.

2601
03:20:34,559 --> 03:20:35,559
Stop.

2602
03:20:36,559 --> 03:20:37,559
Stop.

2603
03:20:37,559 --> 03:20:38,559
Shoot mirror.

2604
03:20:39,559 --> 03:20:41,309
Mirror.

2605
03:20:42,309 --> 03:20:43,739
Shoot mirror.

2606
03:20:44,739 --> 03:20:45,739
Shoot.

2607
03:20:47,739 --> 03:20:48,739
Shoot case three.

2608
03:20:49,739 --> 03:20:52,840
Shoot case two.

2609
03:20:56,770 --> 03:20:57,770
Didn't work.

2610
03:21:02,520 --> 03:21:03,520
The normal way.

2611
03:21:06,040 --> 03:21:07,040
Look at panel.

2612
03:21:07,040 --> 03:21:08,040
Panel.

2613
03:21:14,649 --> 03:21:15,649
Yeah.

2614
03:21:15,649 --> 03:21:17,659
Card reader.

2615
03:21:21,659 --> 03:21:22,659
Do you have one?

2616
03:21:22,659 --> 03:21:25,090
Use card on card reader.

2617
03:21:29,090 --> 03:21:30,090
I'm not there.

2618
03:21:31,090 --> 03:21:34,670
ID card required for awkward opening and closing cases.

2619
03:21:35,670 --> 03:21:38,059
Use ID.

2620
03:21:43,569 --> 03:21:44,569
Use ID.

2621
03:21:46,569 --> 03:21:47,569
No.

2622
03:21:50,340 --> 03:21:51,340
Stop.

2623
03:21:58,860 --> 03:22:00,860
Use ID card on case two.

2624
03:22:08,260 --> 03:22:09,260
Use ID card.

2625
03:22:11,260 --> 03:22:12,260
Dummy.

2626
03:22:23,020 --> 03:22:24,020
Pick up the phone.

2627
03:22:28,209 --> 03:22:29,209
Open the cases.

2628
03:22:29,209 --> 03:22:30,209
Let's take a look.

2629
03:22:37,059 --> 03:22:38,059
Back.

2630
03:22:38,059 --> 03:22:39,059
Back.

2631
03:22:39,059 --> 03:22:40,940
Back.

2632
03:22:43,389 --> 03:22:44,389
Can I get a better angle than this?

2633
03:22:44,389 --> 03:22:46,389
I'm trying to do like a cinematic machinima here.

2634
03:22:46,389 --> 03:22:47,389
Back.

2635
03:22:48,389 --> 03:22:50,340
Target two.

2636
03:22:51,340 --> 03:22:52,340
Target enemy two.

2637
03:22:53,340 --> 03:22:54,340
Head shoot.

2638
03:22:55,340 --> 03:22:56,639
Head shoot.

2639
03:22:56,639 --> 03:22:58,200

Shoot.

2643
03:23:04,190 --> 03:23:05,190
Target three.

2644
03:23:06,190 --> 03:23:08,579
Dodge right.

2645
03:23:08,579 --> 03:23:09,950
Target one.

2646
03:23:11,260 --> 03:23:12,260
No.

2647
03:23:12,260 --> 03:23:13,260
Target enemy one.

2648
03:23:13,260 --> 03:23:15,260
What in the name of God would you say?

2649
03:23:15,260 --> 03:23:16,260
I didn't say heal.

2650
03:23:16,260 --> 03:23:17,260
Enemy one.

2651
03:23:18,260 --> 03:23:19,260
Shoot.

2652
03:23:21,559 --> 03:23:22,559

2653
03:23:22,559 --> 03:23:23,559

2654
03:23:23,559 --> 03:23:24,559
Back.

2655
03:23:24,559 --> 03:23:25,559
Enemy three.

2656
03:23:26,799 --> 03:23:27,799
Shoot head.

2657
03:23:28,799 --> 03:23:30,170
Shoot.

2658
03:23:31,170 --> 03:23:32,409
Shoot.

2659
03:23:32,409 --> 03:23:33,409

2663
03:23:37,409 --> 03:23:38,409

2664
03:23:39,409 --> 03:23:40,709

2670
03:23:48,569 --> 03:23:49,569

2671
03:23:49,569 --> 03:23:50,569
Back.

2672
03:23:50,569 --> 03:23:52,000

2673
03:23:52,000 --> 03:23:53,000
Enemy one.

2674
03:23:54,000 --> 03:23:55,000
Shoot head.

2675
03:23:55,000 --> 03:23:57,069
Shoot stomach.

2676
03:23:57,069 --> 03:23:59,270
Shoot mouth.

2677
03:24:00,450 --> 03:24:01,450
Shoot head.

2678
03:24:01,450 --> 03:24:02,750
Shoot head.

2679
03:24:03,989 --> 03:24:04,989
Stomach.

2680
03:24:04,989 --> 03:24:14,780
Gonna open them all now.

2681
03:24:14,780 --> 03:24:17,219
Use ID card.

2682
03:24:17,219 --> 03:24:18,219
Okay.

2683
03:24:20,969 --> 03:24:22,969
What is it?

2684
03:24:22,969 --> 03:24:23,969
Case three.

2685
03:24:23,969 --> 03:24:24,969
Case three.

2686
03:24:24,969 --> 03:24:25,969
Okay.

2687
03:24:25,969 --> 03:24:29,899
Okay.

2688
03:24:29,899 --> 03:24:30,899
I'll use the ID card.

2689
03:24:30,899 --> 03:24:31,899
Yes you will.

2690
03:24:31,899 --> 03:24:37,680
Okay.

2691
03:24:37,680 --> 03:24:39,680
Now you can disengage the locks.

2692
03:24:39,680 --> 03:24:43,860
Can I?

2693
03:24:43,860 --> 03:24:48,239
Open it up.

2694
03:24:48,239 --> 03:24:54,620
The shelf appears to be for ointments and lotions.

2695
03:24:54,620 --> 03:24:56,620
This is just a liquor store cabinet.

2696
03:24:56,620 --> 03:24:59,979
This is the beer and wine section of the grocery store.

2697
03:24:59,979 --> 03:25:03,540
Grab a fucking 12 pack of cider while we're at it.

2698
03:25:03,540 --> 03:25:05,299
This?

2699
03:25:05,299 --> 03:25:06,659
Here it is.

2700
03:25:06,659 --> 03:25:08,479
Alcohol.

2701
03:25:08,479 --> 03:25:09,479
Oh it is alcohol.

2702
03:25:09,479 --> 03:25:11,479
We can use this to make a molotov cocktail.

2703
03:25:11,479 --> 03:25:16,500
That's right.

2704
03:25:16,500 --> 03:25:17,500
Let me see.

2705
03:25:17,500 --> 03:25:25,700
Alan said that the spider is vulnerable to fire.

2706
03:25:25,700 --> 03:25:27,700
But he was using a flamethrower.

2707
03:25:27,700 --> 03:25:32,139
I wonder if a molotov cocktail would really do the job.

2708
03:25:32,139 --> 03:25:34,139
It is fire so yes.

2709
03:25:34,139 --> 03:25:35,139
But there's no choice.

2710
03:25:35,139 --> 03:25:37,139
This will have to do.

2711
03:25:37,139 --> 03:25:40,139
Hey, operator.

2712
03:25:40,139 --> 03:25:45,319
I'm finding it a little hard to believe those monsters are actually aliens.

2713
03:25:45,319 --> 03:25:47,319
I mean imagine it.

2714
03:25:47,319 --> 03:25:49,319
Aliens attacking people.

2715
03:25:49,319 --> 03:25:51,319
What do you think they are?

2716
03:25:51,319 --> 03:25:52,319
This isn't a movie.

2717
03:25:52,319 --> 03:25:55,319
Do you think they're like parrots?

2718
03:25:55,319 --> 03:25:56,319
No, it's okay.

2719
03:25:56,319 --> 03:25:57,319
Dogs?

2720
03:25:57,319 --> 03:25:58,319
Cats?

2721
03:25:58,319 --> 03:25:59,319
It's fine.

2722
03:25:59,319 --> 03:26:03,559
Anyways, we have to do something about the spider first.

2723
03:26:03,559 --> 03:26:05,559
It's not a spider.

2724
03:26:05,559 --> 03:26:09,559
It's clearly a huge fucking alien with the green eyes.

2725
03:26:09,559 --> 03:26:11,559
And a giant tongue.

2726
03:26:11,559 --> 03:26:12,559
Okay.

2727
03:26:12,559 --> 03:26:16,309
Now we can go exterminate that monster spider.

2728
03:26:16,309 --> 03:26:17,309
Alright.

2729
03:26:17,309 --> 03:26:20,309
We also found that magnesium chip in the equipment room.

2730
03:26:20,309 --> 03:26:23,309
We're ready to fight that spider, right?

2731
03:26:23,309 --> 03:26:24,309
I hope so.

2732
03:26:24,309 --> 03:26:26,309
Then let's go.

2733
03:26:26,309 --> 03:26:31,969
There is a couple there.

2734
03:26:31,969 --> 03:26:32,969
There is a couple there.

2735
03:26:32,969 --> 03:26:33,969
Hold on.

2736
03:26:33,969 --> 03:26:35,139
No, no, no, no.

2737
03:26:35,139 --> 03:26:36,139
Go to case four.

2738
03:26:36,139 --> 03:26:37,139
Case four.

2739
03:26:37,139 --> 03:26:38,139
Okay.

2740
03:26:38,139 --> 03:26:40,020
Okay.

2741
03:26:40,020 --> 03:26:47,319
I'll use the ID card.

2742
03:26:47,319 --> 03:26:48,319
Okay.

2743
03:26:48,319 --> 03:26:50,319
Now you can disengage the locks.

2744
03:26:50,319 --> 03:26:53,319
Hopefully I can replace a heal.

2745
03:26:53,319 --> 03:26:57,819
Because I accidentally used one and I didn't even mean to.

2746
03:26:57,819 --> 03:27:02,260
Heals?

2747
03:27:02,260 --> 03:27:03,750
Great.

2748
03:27:03,750 --> 03:27:05,750
Just one.

2749
03:27:05,750 --> 03:27:10,079
Shoot head.

2750
03:27:10,079 --> 03:27:12,829
Head.

2751
03:27:12,829 --> 03:27:13,829
Head.

2752
03:27:13,829 --> 03:27:14,829

Shake.

2768
03:27:31,829 --> 03:27:32,829
Back.

2769
03:27:32,829 --> 03:27:34,010

Enemy one.

Shoot.

2776

2845
03:40:01,250 --> 03:40:06,760

the job but there's no choice this will have to do hey yeah I'm finding it a

capable of this type of rescue and extraction if that's the case and it

3119

3214
05:00:56,729 --> 05:01:01,049
I'm very bad at speaking, I'm very bad at having somebody interpret the things that I'm

3215
05:01:01,049 --> 05:01:07,209
saying when I clearly say them at least 15 times in a row and I just say the same thing again

3216
05:01:08,090 --> 05:01:12,650
in a different way and she takes it out of the pocket, so I'm sorry I'm bad at that,

3220
05:01:59,029 --> 05:02:10,279
confessions, here comes the clips of me saying it, get up, hallway, why do I even need to,

3221
05:02:10,919 --> 05:02:19,259

3228
05:03:46,599 --> 05:03:52,490
of money to tell me that I'm bad at this game, for me to say that I'm bad at the game,

3229
05:03:57,959 --> 05:04:05,060
I wonder if someone's there, I'll check, today we learned bribing Jerma to say something works

3230
05:04:05,060 --> 05:04:13,799
but it's because he's afraid of getting more money from you and feels bad, all right,

3231
05:04:13,799 --> 05:04:21,860

3238
05:05:16,229 --> 05:05:22,729
oh sorry to hear that, you work here, don't you, what is the situation in the hotel,

3245
05:06:25,049 --> 05:06:28,490
it shouldn't be a problem, I have an operator backing me up,

3246
05:06:29,130 --> 05:06:34,569
he'll open it for us, 700 fucking bucks, you can do it right, I'm looking over it,

3247
05:06:35,849 --> 05:06:39,450

3248
05:06:40,090 --> 05:06:46,889
he says he can, oh what the fuck is going on, what are you guys doing,

3249
05:06:49,159 --> 05:06:51,959
good, but we aren't the only ones in need of rescuing,

3250
05:06:53,000 --> 05:07:00,040
get word to the team leader that, Tora T just gave me 50, yes sir, understood,

3251
05:07:00,040 --> 05:07:08,819

3252
05:07:08,819 --> 05:07:14,740
Takayama's bodyguard, we both better be prepared for more surprises, a lot of community subs

3253
05:07:14,740 --> 05:07:29,529

3255
05:07:41,060 --> 05:07:44,340
all right, we've got, we can do the stream money cool down now, the door panel appears

3259
05:08:15,270 --> 05:08:19,430
local man donates 700 dollars to his favorite streamer to prove his love only to get banned

3260
05:08:19,430 --> 05:08:26,630
when the streamer finds out he has no money left to give, you're awfully slow with

05:08:26,630 --> 05:08:39,740
instructions, that's so evil but it's not the case, no he's not banned, all right,

3323
05:15:50,840 --> 05:15:56,950
Stream that happened so quickly and so much money came through stream labs can't even keep up with it

Can't get into the minister's party is headed for the receiving port. I can't say we need to hurry

05:16:52,759 --> 05:16:55,830
Look at how ridiculous that is

3334
05:16:56,110 --> 05:17:03,240
That is absolutely fucking insane

3335
05:17:05,479 --> 05:17:16,770
Where should I go?

3336
05:17:16,770 --> 05:17:19,669

Someone gave a hundred thousand bits at one time. I don't know say thank you guys. Oh my god

3339
05:17:39,580 --> 05:17:44,779
What was the holdup everyone that came from Joel's worried channel? You sorry you kind of jumped in the middle of that

3340
05:17:45,299 --> 05:17:47,380
But get the operator the main gate now

3341
05:17:47,900 --> 05:17:49,889
It's up to you

3342
05:17:49,889 --> 05:17:59,880
It's a little too quiet

3343
05:17:59,919 --> 05:18:09,939
Stand on left. Are you talking about that? Yeah, put put face in key card

3344
05:18:09,939 --> 05:18:13,959
No, okay for controlling the power supply to a gate. We need the shutter open quick

3345
05:18:14,599 --> 05:18:24,950
How we're done, okay

3346
05:18:26,520 --> 05:18:28,520

3347
05:18:28,759 --> 05:18:33,240
Here comes at least three four deaths

3348
05:18:36,279 --> 05:18:43,970
Give me water. It's gonna be like a huge rushing water

3349
05:18:50,790 --> 05:18:53,700
Muffler guy still has the muffler. That's great

3350
05:18:54,619 --> 05:19:05,689
Dear hey, there's no one here

3351
05:19:06,209 --> 05:19:09,360
It's like we're gonna get surrounded. Where is the rescue team?

3352
05:19:10,040 --> 05:19:12,040
Perhaps they haven't arrived yet, sir

3353
05:19:12,840 --> 05:19:17,799
This isn't a good place to be if we were attacked by aliens in the air gloves, okay, I get it

3354
05:19:20,720 --> 05:19:24,430
At least three people are dead here

3355
05:19:24,990 --> 05:19:26,990
We get a full motion video

3356
05:19:28,389 --> 05:19:32,159
We're surrounded

3357
05:19:33,000 --> 05:19:38,240
Who told you about the rescue team it was a supervisor mr. Powers. I knew something was wrong

3358
05:19:39,200 --> 05:19:42,680
We think muffler guy first. I'll draw their attention when I do that

3359
05:19:43,000 --> 05:19:52,669
Sir, I can't let you do that. Listen, how many can you take?

3360
05:19:54,470 --> 05:20:00,029
No, you can't you can barely take one I figured in that case more for me

3361
05:20:01,150 --> 05:20:03,150
But it gets shown up here

3362
05:20:03,189 --> 05:20:06,830
For missed shots. Well, you're just as bad as I am. That's what he's terrible

3363
05:20:06,830 --> 05:20:08,830
Apparently

3364
05:20:22,599 --> 05:20:32,380
People could fit an event up there there's like 60 people in the vent

3365
05:20:33,060 --> 05:20:55,689
They all aimed down to start firing at the same time. Do I get rescued to

3366
05:20:56,490 --> 05:20:59,490
Barricade the perimeter so nothing can break in. Yes, sir

3367
05:21:00,409 --> 05:21:07,759
I'm sorry about your friend. It could make a rainbow six siege

3368
05:21:07,759 --> 05:21:09,759
I consider

3369
05:21:10,439 --> 05:21:12,439
Captain Yatsu made us sir

3370
05:21:12,720 --> 05:21:14,720
The shuttle terminal has been destroyed

3371
05:21:15,560 --> 05:21:17,560
So we had to break through the ceiling

3372
05:21:18,159 --> 05:21:20,159
That delayed our arrival. Oh

3373
05:21:22,200 --> 05:21:26,040
We received a transmission from mr. Powers describing what has taken place

3374
05:21:26,520 --> 05:21:29,599
We'll be setting up our base of operations here in the receiving court

3375
05:21:29,880 --> 05:21:32,959
We will take all survivors into protective custody here

3376
05:21:33,560 --> 05:21:38,040
Barricades will be erected to keep the aliens out do not leave the area for any reason

3377
05:21:38,240 --> 05:21:40,520
Is that understood understood?

3378
05:21:42,880 --> 05:21:50,610
The suit do I get to wear that may I borrow this that's an armored suit for combat use I

3379
05:21:51,490 --> 05:21:54,610
Want to get changed out of these clothes? They're all sticky with sweat

3380
05:21:56,650 --> 05:21:58,650
So, okay, I can wear this right

3381
05:22:00,810 --> 05:22:02,810
Fine go ahead

3382
05:22:04,299 --> 05:22:07,380
She was so against changing clothes two hours ago

3383
05:22:08,099 --> 05:22:10,939
All of a sudden she wants to wear the earthworm Jim costume

3384
05:22:11,619 --> 05:22:22,319
I mean, I'll be to be honest though. If there was an earthworm Jim

3386
05:22:40,950 --> 05:22:42,950
Naomi is definitely not here

3387
05:22:43,150 --> 05:22:48,970
She must be waiting for help somewhere in the center. Look the rescue team will be here soon enough in

3388
05:22:49,729 --> 05:22:54,490
The meantime, let's go find Helen Johnson the reporter. I can't do this without your help

3389
05:22:55,569 --> 05:22:58,680
Will you just trust me just a little while longer?

3390
05:22:59,599 --> 05:23:03,860
No, hey

3391
05:23:03,860 --> 05:23:05,720
We're not through here

3392
05:23:05,720 --> 05:23:12,639
You're still helping me, right? I haven't had water in seven hours and I haven't had food in seven hours

3393
05:23:12,720 --> 05:23:19,240
Will you just trust me just a little while I'm dying up here. Will you just trust me just a little while longer?

3409
05:25:04,220 --> 05:25:11,349
We have to find Helen and Naomi as soon as we can. It's not safe. I'm going for it. I'll go for it

3410
05:25:12,189 --> 05:25:16,150

This is the last time I was even allowed to save the game

3466
05:30:45,979 --> 05:30:50,330
This was an hour ago. That's the last time I was allowed to save the game

3467
05:30:50,970 --> 05:30:55,610
Well, if I didn't miss

3468
05:30:56,790 --> 05:31:04,770
400 rounds point blank out of like 420 up. Yes

3469
05:31:09,479 --> 05:31:12,400
I couldn't I can't go back in this room. This is the last room. I was allowed to go in

3470
05:31:13,900 --> 05:31:18,340
Hallway because this the electricity happens and it's like, oh, I can't do that anymore

3471
05:31:20,319 --> 05:31:22,159
Hallway. Yes

3472
05:31:22,159 --> 05:31:32,229
Hallway, okay. I'll leave I can't believe with a machine gun. You you missed almost five hundred fucking times point blank

3473
05:31:32,790 --> 05:31:49,159
Where should I go? Oh

3474
05:31:49,880 --> 05:31:51,880
Man what?

3475
05:31:52,759 --> 05:31:59,979
Shutter six. This is how far back that is. Okay, run. Yes

3476
05:32:00,419 --> 05:32:18,799
I don't think there was even a save point in the middle

3477
05:32:18,799 --> 05:32:21,500
It was like the the hallway stuff the bunch of cutscenes

3478
05:32:22,139 --> 05:32:26,700
Cutscene again military comes in and then that was there even I don't think it was even a save point

3479
05:32:27,459 --> 05:32:29,459
Maybe in that room that I walked into

3480
05:32:32,490 --> 05:32:34,490
We finally made it to here

3481
05:32:35,049 --> 05:32:37,349
The receiving port is just ahead

3482
05:32:39,659 --> 05:32:51,220
Yeah, cuz I can't leave this happens and then when I come out I can't go anywhere right check

3483
05:32:51,779 --> 05:33:05,729
Is there anyone here?

3484
05:33:05,810 --> 05:33:14,180
This is terrible, I'll check in the back if you see anything tell me don't screw up

3485
05:33:24,779 --> 05:33:32,020
There doesn't appear to be anyone. I must have been imagining things. Sorry. Guess I didn't need you that time. Look out

3486
05:33:57,229 --> 05:33:59,549
I

3487
05:33:59,549 --> 05:34:05,790
Damn it. No, there's so much in between this shit. Apparently some of the aliens are humanoid

3488
05:34:09,979 --> 05:34:17,720
I'm gonna try this one more time. Sorry to hear that. We're so we're very they're so close to me. What is the situation in the hotel?

3489
05:34:18,319 --> 05:34:19,919
No, anything

3490
05:34:19,919 --> 05:34:22,740
I'm not sure what's happening either

3491
05:34:22,740 --> 05:34:27,340
But I've been told that a rescue team will be arriving in the receiving port. We have to be getting close

3492
05:34:28,540 --> 05:34:30,380
rescue team a

3493
05:34:30,380 --> 05:34:35,619
Rescue team. Oh, dear. That's wonderful. Oh, it's good news. Yes

3494
05:34:39,580 --> 05:34:41,900
But sir, which unit could it be

3495
05:34:43,139 --> 05:34:45,220
Let's see how far this one special forces

3496
05:34:46,580 --> 05:34:49,380
If so, that makes this a military incident

3497
05:34:49,459 --> 05:34:54,619
There was talk that the police department had a task force capable of this type of rescue and extraction

3498
05:34:54,619 --> 05:34:59,060
if that's the case and it is the police we should be able to cover up some of the legal issues that

3499
05:34:59,619 --> 05:35:04,360
Stem from this incident still it's a problem. I wasn't involved. Oh, yes

3500
05:35:07,619 --> 05:35:09,619
It's got some politics

3501
05:35:11,099 --> 05:35:12,540
By the way

3502
05:35:12,540 --> 05:35:17,580
There's a big problem. The receiving port shutter is locked in and it won't open

3503
05:35:18,659 --> 05:35:25,099
What's that? It shouldn't be a problem. I have an operator backing me up. He'll open it for us

3504
05:35:26,180 --> 05:35:28,490
You can do it, right?

3505
05:35:28,569 --> 05:35:33,220
Yes, I knew you could do it. Yes, I can go. He says he can hurry. Oh

3506
05:35:36,150 --> 05:35:37,909
Good news

3507
05:35:37,909 --> 05:35:43,330
Good. He's still here. We aren't the only ones in need of rescuing

3508
05:35:43,889 --> 05:35:48,150
Get word to the team leader that I won't board the shuttle

3509
05:35:48,709 --> 05:35:50,619
Yes, sir

3510
05:35:50,619 --> 05:35:53,060
Understood fine. Let's be on our way. I

3511
05:35:53,979 --> 05:36:01,459
Never expected to be attacked by Prime Minister Takayama's bodyguard

3512
05:36:02,299 --> 05:36:04,700
We both better be prepared for more surprises

3513
05:36:05,700 --> 05:36:19,540
Okay for a luck got baited into dropping 800

3514
05:36:20,700 --> 05:36:29,790
See remember that the door closes behind me

3515
05:36:30,509 --> 05:36:32,509
And I can't go in here

3516
05:36:32,509 --> 05:36:38,340
Why would you the door panel appears to have been broken is the only safe point back here?

3517
05:36:38,340 --> 05:36:42,220
I can't get into the moon. Why wouldn't you let somebody save the game after like a long-ass cutscene like that?

3518
05:36:42,860 --> 05:36:50,279
The Prime Minister's part I go through the shuttle port. We need to hurry like tonight shutters six shutters six

3519
05:36:50,279 --> 05:36:52,970
Can I go through it?

3520
05:36:53,009 --> 05:36:54,770
Run. Yes

3521
05:36:54,849 --> 05:37:00,659
What should I do now?

3522
05:37:00,659 --> 05:37:04,369

3523
05:37:04,409 --> 05:37:06,409
guest room five so far away

3524
05:37:07,689 --> 05:37:24,939
Run yes, and do the door lock, please

3525
05:37:30,330 --> 05:37:52,250
Thanks my chat experience. What is this? What's what what's wrong? What's happening?

3526
05:37:53,110 --> 05:37:56,819
Save point the save point. Okay

3527
05:37:57,540 --> 05:38:10,659
Wait people don't know we're talking politics. No, nobody's always talking politics. Are we we got a rule? No politics?

3528
05:38:11,299 --> 05:38:38,299
Yeah, okay. I got it already

3529
05:38:41,659 --> 05:38:43,509
Okay

3530
05:38:43,509 --> 05:38:47,590
Hallway, so now we got now. We have to watch another cutscene

3531
05:38:48,229 --> 05:38:53,479
If I lose it again

3532
05:38:53,479 --> 05:38:55,479

3536
05:39:37,080 --> 05:39:39,080
well, the reason why you're bored of it is because

3537
05:39:39,720 --> 05:39:48,049

3585
05:44:18,659 --> 05:44:22,659
I'm not gonna lose. We're gonna do it right now. Everyone, the guy dies.

3586
05:44:31,720 --> 05:44:43,750
It's up to you. Hallway. It's a little too quiet.

3587
05:44:43,750 --> 05:44:50,619
Right panel. Panel? What panel do you mean?

3588
05:45:18,380 --> 05:45:36,509
I'm just here enjoying the stream. That's good.

3589
05:45:36,509 --> 05:45:43,909
Dear? Hey, there's no one here. Where is the rescue team?

3590
05:45:43,909 --> 05:45:49,150
Perhaps they haven't arrived yet, sir. This isn't a good place to be.

3591
05:45:49,150 --> 05:45:52,150
If we were attacked by aliens in the open...

3592
05:45:58,509 --> 05:46:00,509
That's no good. Turn around.

3593
05:46:02,509 --> 05:46:06,159
We're surrounded.

3594
05:46:07,159 --> 05:46:09,159
Who told you about the rescue team?

3595
05:46:09,159 --> 05:46:11,159
It was the supervisor, Mr. Powers.

3596
05:46:11,159 --> 05:46:13,159
I knew something was wrong.

3597
05:46:13,159 --> 05:46:19,159
Oh, what? I pressed select.

3598
05:46:19,159 --> 05:46:21,159
Before.

3599
05:46:21,159 --> 05:46:25,830
Listen to this. Naomi is definitely not here. She must be waiting for help somewhere.

3600
05:46:25,830 --> 05:46:27,830
I pressed every button like three times.

3601
05:46:27,830 --> 05:46:30,830
Look, the rescue team will be here soon enough.

3602
05:46:30,830 --> 05:46:33,830
In the meantime, let's go find Helen Johnson, the reporter.

3603
05:46:33,830 --> 05:46:36,830
I can't do this without your help.

3604
05:46:36,830 --> 05:46:49,369
Will you just trust me? Just a little while longer?

3605
05:46:49,369 --> 05:46:53,299
Come on. Come on, just do it.

3606
05:46:53,299 --> 05:46:57,479
No. Yes.

3607
05:46:57,479 --> 05:47:00,549
Thanks. I've been interested in you two.

3608
05:47:00,549 --> 05:47:02,549
I wanna sneeze into the microphone so bad, but I haven't been able to do it ever.

3609
05:47:02,549 --> 05:47:06,549
I get sneeze shy when it happens. It's really irritating.

3610
05:47:06,549 --> 05:47:15,130
I know this will work, and I managed to get one of these.

3611
05:47:15,130 --> 05:47:17,130
Yeah, you're a terrible shot.

3612
05:47:17,130 --> 05:47:21,939
The P.M.'s group should be safe now, especially with weapons like these to protect them.

3613
05:47:21,939 --> 05:47:27,549
Okay, let's get out of here.

3614
05:47:27,549 --> 05:47:35,700
I can't believe select does it, and I really thought I pressed it a dozen times.

3615
05:47:35,700 --> 05:47:53,380
Phew. Got away safely, thanks to that wireless system.

3616
05:47:53,380 --> 05:47:59,799
There's supposed to be a monster that even the rescue team couldn't handle.

3617
05:47:59,799 --> 05:48:03,680
We have to find Helen and Naomi as soon as we can.

3618
05:48:03,680 --> 05:48:04,680
Can I go back and receiving port?

3619
05:48:04,680 --> 05:48:12,259
It's not safe. If we were to check every room one by one, we'd surely find them.

3620
05:48:12,259 --> 05:48:18,869
Past here is the staff area. Where shall we check first?

3621
05:48:18,869 --> 05:48:22,240
Receiving port, right?

3622
05:48:22,240 --> 05:48:26,659
Receiving port.

3623
05:48:26,659 --> 05:48:28,659
The receiving port, okay?

3624
05:48:28,659 --> 05:48:30,659
Just go back in, see if there's a kiosk.

3625
05:48:30,659 --> 05:48:32,659
Aren't we going to look for Naomi?

3626
05:48:32,659 --> 05:48:33,659
No, okay, so then...

3627
05:48:33,659 --> 05:48:35,659
Let's move on.

3628
05:48:35,659 --> 05:48:37,659
Surface staff quarters.

3629
05:48:37,659 --> 05:48:38,659
The service staff quarters.

3630
05:48:38,659 --> 05:48:39,659
Run.

3631
05:48:39,659 --> 05:48:40,659
Yes.

3632
05:48:40,659 --> 05:49:02,840
Listen, do you hear shooting?

3633
05:49:02,840 --> 05:49:07,150
Shooting?

3634
05:49:07,150 --> 05:49:20,759
I think it's from the warehouse. We should check it out. It's a dead end this way.

3635
05:49:20,759 --> 05:49:28,049
Why is that showing up on stream right now? That's from an hour and a half ago.

3636
05:49:28,049 --> 05:49:34,770
If something happens, I need you to tell me what to do.

3637
05:49:34,770 --> 05:49:37,770
That is so big.

3638
05:49:37,770 --> 05:49:39,770
That's a cosplay gun.

3639
05:49:39,770 --> 05:49:53,139
A major wobble was detected in the fake station's rotation.

3640
05:49:53,139 --> 05:50:00,759
The station was placed on emergency status, although the wobble will not interfere with its orbit.

3641
05:50:00,759 --> 05:50:08,209
Phew. It sounds like a war zone.

3642
05:50:08,209 --> 05:50:10,209
I think there was a warehouse key in my room.

3643
05:50:10,209 --> 05:50:11,209
One person shooting.

3644
05:50:11,209 --> 05:50:19,349
Let's go get it. It's in the service staff quarters.

3645
05:50:19,349 --> 05:50:21,349
So I have to go in there.

3646
05:50:21,349 --> 05:50:23,529
Service staff quarters.

3647
05:50:23,529 --> 05:50:25,529
The service staff quarters. Okay.

3648
05:50:25,529 --> 05:50:26,529
Run.

3649
05:50:26,529 --> 05:50:27,529
Yes.

3650
05:50:27,529 --> 05:50:38,500
Really?

3651
05:50:38,500 --> 05:50:39,500
Back.

3652
05:50:39,500 --> 05:50:40,500
Back.

3653
05:50:40,500 --> 05:50:42,380
Right eye.

3654
05:50:42,380 --> 05:50:43,380
Right eye.

3655
05:50:43,380 --> 05:50:44,380
Left eye.

3656
05:50:44,380 --> 05:50:45,380
Left eye.

3657
05:50:45,380 --> 05:50:46,380
Left eye.

3658
05:50:46,380 --> 05:50:47,380
Middle eye.

3659
05:50:47,380 --> 05:50:48,380
Middle eye.

3660
05:50:48,380 --> 05:50:49,380
My body.

3661
05:50:49,380 --> 05:50:50,810
Red eye.

3662
05:50:50,810 --> 05:50:51,810
Did you see that?

3663
05:50:51,810 --> 05:50:53,810
Okay, let's go.

3664
05:50:53,810 --> 05:51:00,360
Service staff quarters.

3665
05:51:00,360 --> 05:51:01,360
The service staff quarters.

3666
05:51:01,360 --> 05:51:02,360
Run.

3667
05:51:02,360 --> 05:51:03,360
Okay.

3668
05:51:03,360 --> 05:51:04,360
Run.

3669
05:51:04,360 --> 05:51:20,189
Yes.

3670
05:51:20,189 --> 05:51:22,139
What is this?

3671
05:51:22,139 --> 05:51:23,139
Big monster?

3672
05:51:24,139 --> 05:51:25,139
This is bad.

3673
05:51:25,139 --> 05:51:29,599
What about my room?

3674
05:51:29,599 --> 05:51:30,599
My room?

3675
05:51:30,599 --> 05:51:33,479
What do you mean my room?

3676
05:51:33,479 --> 05:51:39,299
Oh, this is fantastic.

3677
05:51:39,299 --> 05:51:42,299
I just ran into like the last boss.

3678
05:51:42,299 --> 05:51:43,299
Back.

3679
05:51:43,299 --> 05:51:44,299
Back.

3680
05:51:44,299 --> 05:51:45,299
Back.

3681
05:51:45,299 --> 05:51:46,299
Back.

3682
05:51:46,299 --> 05:51:48,299
Shoot root.

3683
05:51:48,299 --> 05:51:49,299
Root.

3684
05:51:49,299 --> 05:51:51,569
Root.

3685
05:51:51,569 --> 05:51:53,569
Branch's root.

3686
05:51:53,569 --> 05:51:54,569
Root.

3687
05:51:54,569 --> 05:51:56,000

3688
05:51:56,000 --> 05:51:57,000

07:36:33,930 --> 07:36:50,310
that was scripted right area b area b okay yes it's a dead end it doesn't look like i can

07:51:32,200 --> 07:51:36,759
put it in the microwave just eat it while you're watching tv since a reporter can't help us

space do i say that people finally began viewing themselves objectively after they started

4535
08:41:57,979 --> 08:42:08,090
seeing earth from space perhaps also maybe they fell to separation with reality as well

4536
08:42:10,680 --> 08:42:19,939
but what about you are you really alive that is the absolute stupidest question i have ever

4546
08:44:00,599 --> 08:44:08,090

4547
08:44:08,090 --> 08:44:16,220
sudden well i just wanted to get to know you better after all we don't know anything about

4552
08:44:43,770 --> 08:44:50,150

4553
08:44:50,150 --> 08:44:59,380
people to be with someone rather than being alone when we get back to earth maybe i'll get

4554
08:44:59,380 --> 08:45:08,340
you to introduce me to someone please remain seated until the safety bar has been lifted

4555
08:45:08,340 --> 08:45:09,939
and then they'll let you go to like what about you

4556
08:45:12,259 --> 08:45:16,340

now get her some glasses when you get your prescription

4558
08:45:54,090 --> 08:45:58,169
a severe wobble was detected in the space station's rotation

4559
08:45:58,729 --> 08:46:05,369
the station was placed on emergency status although the wobble will not interfere with the

4560
08:46:05,369 --> 08:46:10,650
context of the video game elevator use is prohibited i guess that means there's no turning back

4561
08:46:12,009 --> 08:46:15,930
no turning back starting to collapse we're at the apex of the game this is

4562

5010

soft edge corporation paracelsus plan that didn't say plans his project are you familiar

5011
10:20:33,680 --> 10:20:39,599
with the philosopher stone it is said to have been in the possession of paracelsus

5012
10:20:39,680 --> 10:20:46,239
a 16th century european philosopher capable of generating intense healing power

5013
10:20:46,239 --> 10:20:52,720
it was a stone that defied human comprehension it was studied by some scholars of the time

5014
10:20:53,440 --> 10:21:00,480
but despite lengthy research their efforts were in vain at long last however we have

5015
10:21:00,559 --> 10:21:10,000
succeeded in reproducing the philosopher stone this is it this is it the philosopher stone we

5016
10:21:10,000 --> 10:21:16,559
have created is identical in composition and structure to the original and its potency is

5017
10:21:16,559 --> 10:21:24,000
even greater so what are you gonna do this photo presents a simulation of the effects of the

5018
10:21:24,000 --> 10:21:31,040
original philosopher stone as noted in ancient manuscripts the next photo shows the results of

5019
10:21:31,040 --> 10:21:35,360
an experiment based on the instructions in those ancient documents it's obviously not

5020
10:21:35,360 --> 10:21:42,000
working because it's turning people into fucking mad as you can see our philosopher stone is

5021
10:21:42,000 --> 10:21:48,559
capable of producing effects precisely opposite to those produced by the original slugs instead

5022
10:21:48,559 --> 10:21:54,639
of healing a living thing so that it may survive it curses the organism which remains

5023
10:21:54,639 --> 10:22:02,239
alive a number of possible results of the use of this stone can be imagined but the most effective

5024
10:22:02,239 --> 10:22:08,720
is the use of an accursed hex capable of plunging a civilized society into chaos

5025
10:22:09,760 --> 10:22:16,480
this very stone has been spared in order that your country may carry out its plan of battle

5026
10:22:16,480 --> 10:22:19,599
and we believe that this is the only measure available

5027
10:22:20,160 --> 10:22:29,519
i'm gonna go break the beauty and the beast uh rose glass it's an alien

5206
10:55:27,319 --> 10:55:35,019
so the last digit of each one would be 249 that's easy add them up and

5207
10:55:35,019 --> 10:55:41,180
enter it what I just missed it I enter the sum of the date and the

5210
10:56:14,660 --> 10:56:18,699
hotel how would you ever know that enter the number of detect gender the

5211
10:56:18,699 --> 10:56:21,900
the guest checked in the hotel

5212
10:56:53,000 --> 10:57:12,400
the note out of 50 guests 13 survivors as of 216 so 50 50 guests 50 agreed the

5213
10:57:12,400 --> 10:57:36,760
number of checked in guest should be 50 enter it how do I enter the code okay

5214
10:57:37,760 --> 10:57:46,900
enter the sum of the last digits of p.m. Takayama's birthday enter the sum of

5215
10:57:46,900 --> 10:58:09,040
the last digits of p.m. Takayama's birthday dny was really nice knowing

5216
10:58:09,040 --> 10:58:19,360
you you're right didn't he say something about that at some point I

5217
10:58:23,629 --> 10:58:27,550
thought we were just dead I thought the bomb was gonna explode man hopefully

5218
10:58:27,550 --> 10:58:32,430
it would trigger it up a mega-memory that's great

5219
10:58:58,550 --> 10:59:16,190
we turn off the fucking dubstep what did he say 60 so it was 60 the 60 times

5220
10:59:16,190 --> 10:59:24,239
what is the rule and the sum of the last digits of the birthday 60 so that

5221
10:59:24,239 --> 10:59:31,699
would be so what is today what's it what year is this supposed to be 20

5222
10:59:31,699 --> 10:59:54,230
20 what 20 29 minus 60 is there 30 20 29 minus 60 is 19 90 so yeah you're

5223
10:59:54,230 --> 11:00:10,500
right okay so there'd be 30 would be 30 15 because you only need the last

5224
11:00:10,500 --> 11:00:39,819
digit okay yeah you only need the last digit don't drop it do you like to take

5225
11:00:39,819 --> 11:00:46,239

5306
11:15:04,239 --> 11:15:29,050
aim at lever shoot shoot top lever red shoot red out of cover red shoot red

5307
11:15:29,769 --> 11:16:05,290
let's do it shoot just shoot red again yellow now shoot yellow shoot no no no another grenade

5308
11:16:05,290 --> 11:16:28,400
no another grenade no another grenade why did I stop because people were telling me that

5309
11:16:29,900 --> 11:16:36,480
they could shoot I've the real question you should be asking yourself is why did it take

5310
11:16:37,279 --> 11:16:47,440
like 17 times saying shoot red shoot red lever red lever shoot red shoot red why did it take

5311
11:16:47,440 --> 11:17:11,839
that many times that's the question you should be asking I can't fucking believe it and the

5312
11:17:11,839 --> 11:17:18,720
reason why is because somebody said the one guy and I listened it was when I when you go

5313
11:17:18,720 --> 11:17:32,319
out of cover you could just get shot by one of these guys if there is that true so wait

5314
11:17:32,319 --> 11:17:41,849
so it is true so I would have just died anyways if I did shoot yellow yellow lever I can't believe

5315
11:17:41,849 --> 11:18:02,889
I have to do that whole thing again what were they thinking what the hell are you thinking

5316
11:18:07,480 --> 11:18:14,059
you put an unskippable like seven minutes of cutscene and a bomb diffusion thing with

5317
11:18:14,059 --> 11:18:17,500

all right so it's shoot red left soldier right soldier

5434
11:45:51,440 --> 11:46:24,669

5436
11:46:31,959 --> 11:46:34,360

11:47:55,639 --> 11:48:02,029
when I'm being pulled both ways if left soldier right soldier it just ruined the

5441
11:48:02,029 --> 11:48:09,480

11:48:30,919 --> 11:48:44,360
not gonna start until 4 p.m pacific because this is going very late watch the no I might

5444
11:48:44,360 --> 11:48:50,800
finish this tomorrow I think I'm actually gonna jump back into this and finish it tomorrow

5445
11:48:51,360 --> 11:49:10,080
so 4 p.m pacific when the stream is gonna start Merry Christmas or whatever today today

5446
11:49:10,080 --> 11:49:18,879
like today because another stream is gonna happen today it is also because I only have

5447
11:49:19,519 --> 11:49:27,639
no health I actually think the game is fun fairly fun and funny and interesting so I mean

5448
11:49:31,529 --> 11:49:38,889
but for the sake of how late this is and how I have to get up and stream again

5449
11:49:39,769 --> 11:49:49,550
we're probably going to let's see here let me see how many bits there are because there are

5450
11:49:49,550 --> 11:49:54,919
a lot of subs too I want to show the credits at least let's go through some of these

5451
11:49:54,919 --> 11:50:16,940
because I think no never mind that's not gonna work yeah I think I have to just save the bit

5452
11:50:16,940 --> 11:50:26,839
reading for tomorrow because this is this is a lot of people give a ton of money today like an

5453
11:50:26,839 --> 11:50:30,599
absolute monumental amount of fucking money and this this stream will go on for like

5454
11:50:30,599 --> 11:50:43,959
another two and a half hours which would then be about five plus a.m pacific so I'm gonna

5455
11:50:43,959 --> 11:50:49,480
run the credits the we have that website that tracks everything so I'm gonna go over

5456
11:50:50,040 --> 11:50:55,629
the bits from today tomorrow so tomorrow you're gonna be reading bits before I was

5457
11:50:56,349 --> 11:51:07,239
no I'm gonna probably go through them as quickly as I can but holy shit guys

5458
11:51:08,410 --> 11:51:14,650
there was seriously like there was like probably almost three grand today if you're

5459
11:51:14,730 --> 11:51:22,910
including subscriptions bits there were hundreds of gifted subs thousands of dollars

5460
11:51:22,910 --> 11:51:28,599
and bits it was it was insane and I'm really sorry that I just I really don't have it

5461
11:51:28,599 --> 11:51:37,230
in me mentally for energy right now to go through and do them all just know that I can't

5462
11:51:37,230 --> 11:51:46,730
thank you enough thousands of fucking dollars in one day so I'm gonna get some sleep I'll

5466
11:52:03,449 --> 11:52:08,569

5467
11:52:08,569 --> 11:52:16,169
it's gonna be crazy and then we can get some sleep is it even running holy shit

5468
11:52:20,440 --> 11:52:29,599
that might be the fastest it's ever gone I've never seen it scroll that fast

5469
11:52:30,160 --> 11:52:54,330
holy shit have fun reading that yeah good night guys see you in uh like 12 and a half hours

5470
11:52:54,330 --> 11:53:10,720
whatever it is you stayed so I you stayed so I could read your bits at the end I am sad

5471
11:53:11,360 --> 11:53:17,019
I'm really sorry but I am out of gas completely I never expected I was gonna

5472
11:53:17,019 --> 11:53:22,459
play this for more than like eight to seven to eight plus hours but I gotta be honest with

5473
11:53:22,459 --> 11:53:29,290
you guys I'm out of gas completely and I would not I would rather hold on to them and do them

5474
11:53:29,290 --> 11:53:36,169
when I have energy than like sleepy almost almost potentially lazily going through them

5475
11:53:37,360 --> 11:53:50,160
you know I'm saying did you see cry yeah actually I did uh Kraken was in town

5476
11:53:51,529 --> 11:53:54,889
he's really really great he hit me up he said hey I'm gonna be in Vegas and I was

5477
11:53:54,889 --> 11:54:07,680
like I'll come say hello hung up for a little while it was great I came back from a pee break

5478
11:54:07,680 --> 11:54:12,879
did I miss anything uh well you missed left soldier right soldier is what you missed

5479
11:54:26,589 --> 11:54:35,580
I had coached him on gambling well I pressed a button and I won money there's not much

5480
11:54:35,580 --> 11:54:54,809
not much coaching this has got to be 500 fucking subs let me see yeah it's this is

5481
11:54:54,809 --> 11:55:00,400
close to 500 subs in one day I think that's only ever happened to maybe one or two more

5482
11:55:00,400 --> 11:55:08,139
other times how much money have I made isn't it how much money have I made this month how

5483
11:55:08,139 --> 11:55:14,620
much money did I make this stream this straights gotta be at least two to three grand has to be

5484
11:55:14,620 --> 11:55:29,819
this stream probably just opened like another dozen emotes lots or something

5485
11:55:36,910 --> 11:55:43,849
but that's gonna be it thank you everybody I honestly am floored I can't believe it's

5486
11:55:43,849 --> 11:55:54,970
shocking the just the ridiculous amount of money and support it's absolutely ridiculous

5487
11:55:57,610 --> 11:56:05,120
