1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:12,119
Goddammit. I went downstairs, and when I came back up, my Scribblio link expired.

2
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:19,719
So, I wrote a bunch of names. I wrote a bunch of custom things to Scribble.

3
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:24,760
And the gah. It's alright. Yeah, hold on. I got the quickest hands in the west.

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:35,460
Okay. Alright. Yeah, okay. Wait, oh! People don't even know what the fuck is going on.

5
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:42,380
Uh, hi! First of all, how are you? Today, uh, yeah, I just... I just started the stream as

6
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:49,020
if everybody knew what we were doing. Oh, my link expired! What link? German, what are you

7
00:00:49,020 --> 00:01:01,560
talking about? Well, the next couple days, including today, are going to be, uh, chill,

8
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:09,450
short streams. It's getting down to the last seven days or so, six days, before the carnival.

9
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:15,450
And I really, really, really... I gotta put... Essentially, that's where all my brain is right

10
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:24,099
now. I'm having meetings every day over, um, the phone. It's... That is where my brain is

11
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:31,849
at the moment. So, I... As of today, I can't really focus on stream-related stuff, so we're

12
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:38,439
just gonna hang out. Tomorrow, though, is the activity book stream. We're going to go through

13
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:45,299
a bunch of the cool shit that you guys have done. That's also gonna be only probably a few hours,

14
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,579
because once I'm done with this stream, boom, I'm out of here. I'm literally gonna go and

15
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:59,140
do a bunch of other shit. Tomorrow, the second that stream is over, see ya. I'm out. I'm gonna

16
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:05,799
do a bunch of shit for that stream on the 21st. So, the next couple days, we're just gonna hang

17
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:12,310
out. Maybe this stream will be a few hours. Maybe. Depends. But don't expect the next couple streams

18
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:17,900
to be more than, like, six, seven, eight hours, like they are sometimes. But, what we're doing

19
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,740
today, that we're just gonna hang out, we are going to do something that has been incredibly

20
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:28,409
highly requested by everybody. And, I mean, every single person has requested this at least one

21
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:44,099
time. It's to play Scribbleio with your friends. And who better than you guys? You know? Who? You

22
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:49,139
did. I did. Yes, you did. I have a... Look, the only way I said I was gonna do this is if I looked

23
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:54,099
up a log, and if every single person that's ever come into this room, into the chat room,

24
00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:00,419
at least once did they say, please play Scribbleio, is the only way I was gonna do it. And they did.

25
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:11,020
So, how this is gonna work is the sub discord is currently open. I have an invite link. I'm

26
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:18,280
just gonna send it in there. It's gonna be a sub only thing, because you know how player people are.

27
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:26,629
Speaking of subs, five of you just may have gotten a chance to do it. Whoever the five of you,

28
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:32,740
get in that discord right now. It might be you. What the fuck is this? Don't link gifts in here.

29
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:43,539
That was back in the five community subs. Thank you, back in. And I didn't even tweet anything.

30
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:52,550
I've been so scattered. I'm so fucking like lit right now. Yes, I did say that.

31
00:03:53,270 --> 00:04:00,229
I have a coach now. I have a Twitch coach. Told me to use the word lit more often. Told me to use

32
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:06,389
the word epic more often. And I'm gonna see if it works. He guaranteed me five to ten percent more

33
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:44,699
viewership if I did that. Let me just make a tweet. I'll be right back. Is chilling out with a crayon

34
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:57,430
in my hand make sense for this stream? I don't think it does. How about, because it's a drawing.

35
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:07,019
There's another drawing game that I'm doing after this too. I fucking don't know. I don't

36
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:12,980
know. I never know what to write here. This is, I'm gonna give you guys the bane of a streamer

37
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:20,310
or youtuber's existence. This is like creating a new character every day in a game. I don't know

38
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:27,129
what this guy's name is gonna be. I don't know what this stream's attributes are at the moment.

39
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:40,459
AdventureMFDan, thanks for the five subs. I'm just gonna write drawing and drawing and decline.

40
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:57,259
No, that makes it. Drawing and, that's it. Drawing in. Because I don't know what the end is. Done?

41
00:05:57,259 --> 00:06:06,250
Okay. Drawing in. All right, the link is about to go into the sub discord. I suggest you go fast

42
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,930
because it ain't gonna be there for very long. And people right now are doing something they're

43
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:17,129
not supposed to be doing in this channel. They're spamming and they're gonna get in trouble.

44
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:25,879
I've got all your names. I'm waiting for it to settle down in here.

45
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,540
That's right. Yeah, you're doing the monkey ass. You're not supposed to be spamming in this channel.

46
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:41,379
Here it comes. You've, I'm only doing this once, so blame your fellow sub discord member.

47
00:06:42,019 --> 00:07:04,970
Okay, so I think, does that, does that mean that it's all been dumped in here? Is that what that

48
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:19,259
means? Oh shit, are you guys supposed to look at that? You guys weren't supposed to see the

49
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:31,189
words, the custom words. All right, I guess we're going. Oh, by the way, what's like my,

50
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:39,000
absolute kill switch here? How do I like ban somebody? It's my turn. No, Bruce is drawing.

51
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:49,800
Wait, but I do, I don't know all the words. It's all that you just guess. How many times can I

52
00:07:49,800 --> 00:08:06,220
guess? How often can, oh wait, I don't know, it's two words. Um, tie? Bow tie. Is that a shirt?

53
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:24,600
Pre, is that a cross? What? Priest? Uh, shirt. There's a V in there.

54
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:43,559
V neck? Is there a switch? There's a switch on the shirt. Vertical shirt. TV shirt. Steve Jobs?

55
00:08:48,980 --> 00:09:02,620
What? Why, was it an iPhone? Circle. Got it. Wait, people can just watch the stream.

56
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:41,289
Blueberry. Is that earth? Um, E. We're, we're, grass? Globe? Oh shit. Globe, of course.

57
00:09:50,899 --> 00:10:01,980
Carrot. Anytime you see two orange lines connecting for a triangle upside down,

58
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:22,700
it's a carrot, no matter what. What is this? What is that? That's so funny. Carrot man.

59
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:46,710
Get a lot of time to draw on this one in this game. Uh, bed. Bunk bed. Is it a flag?

60
00:10:49,320 --> 00:11:20,710
US, is it United States flag? What is that? Oh, forehead. No, I, no, I don't. North Canada?

61
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:38,870
Canada? Oh, help me. North? Oh, okay. I thought that said forehead or something at first.

62
00:11:41,419 --> 00:12:01,080
North Canada. Kick Jermo. Well, I didn't do anything. Book? How would you get this? It's a,

63
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:09,179
it's a rectangle. It's an iPhone. It's an iPad. It's a, uh, it's a, it's a surface.

64
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:28,100
That's a surface. Oh, it's a tablet. It's a tablet. Well, I got it right. It should be like Family

65
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:39,029
Feud. If I say iPad, it should be like, you got it. I didn't make these words, guys. Like, Steve

66
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:51,190
Jobs, Apple tablets, not me. How would you get that? That quickly? Glove? That's like a South

67
00:12:51,190 --> 00:13:25,779
Park hand. That's a minion. A minion. That's actually pretty good. Branch. Tree. Log. Map.

68
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:36,009
Country. Person's face. That's like, it's a nose and this, the mouth right here. A monster or

69
00:13:36,009 --> 00:14:01,799
something? I don't know. A beard? Wait a minute. I, it was, you know what it gave it away? You know

70
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:37,720
what gave it away for me? The gray. This right here. A street lamp or something? A firework.

71
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:57,350
That's a nice touch. That was a nice touch. It was. All right, let me, I want to draw. Don't listen.

72
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:09,159
Don't say your answer. I'm going to type the answer. It doesn't matter. I put a sensor bar

73
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:25,419
over the text box. All right, I'll do that next round. Hat. A, um, bed? Lying in bed.

74
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:49,940
A teacher. Let's choose a chalkboard. It's just the first part. That's actually, I like this.

75
00:15:50,580 --> 00:16:01,129
This. You didn't write the word chalk. That was pretty good. Oh, Otto is choosing a word. I wonder

76
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:33,580
what it's going to be. What? No. All right. All right. All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. I

77
00:16:33,580 --> 00:17:05,180
got it. Boomer prince. Boomer princess. Oh. Boomer princess means queen. It's, you guys don't make

78
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:09,900
any sense of the boomer shit. That just is somebody that happens to be older than you

79
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:15,980
is a boomer. What if you're, what if you're like 40 and the person above you is 41,

80
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:45,369
are they a boomer and you not? I don't fucking, how the fuck do you spell alcohol?

81
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:07,980
Ooh, no, everyone's going to guess. Why did I? No, I got to turn. Oh yeah. Good luck. Oh,

82
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:58,470
fucking whatever. I'm still going to do it. I have to like, censor this shit. Otherwise like,

83
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,470
I might as well just be watching chat play this game. Is that what we're doing today?

84
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:12,539
For like the couple hours that I'm going to be here. You guys just play this game with it together.

85
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:26,579
Cover the top part. Yeah. Yeah. I hold on. I got to, I got to at least stay in the game here.

86
00:19:33,099 --> 00:19:44,900
Bull. Damn it. All right. I'm going to, let me do this. I need to make some sensors here.

87
00:19:44,900 --> 00:20:07,140
Okay. Background color. All right. No, what the fuck is going on? Wait, I got to guess this.

88
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:29,109
Uh, person. Kid. Man. Guy. I'm the first fucking one to get it. And now everyone's going to be

89
00:20:30,869 --> 00:21:06,789
should have had that shit ready to go. Oh well. How do you? No, that looks horrible. I'm just

90
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:12,470
going to make it, just make it black. Blocked. That just looks like my computer's broken.

91
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:27,740
This is like grandma has a bunch of viruses. Trying to do like this. Are you trying to do this?

92
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,390
I got to do this side too. How do I turn that off? Cause people can still see that.

93
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:46,920
How is that not the sun? Just zoom it in. Yeah. But it's still going to bleed into the side here.

94
00:21:51,130 --> 00:22:47,819
H. There we go. Uh, what is that? Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

95
00:22:51,539 --> 00:23:00,230
What? How do I spell it? Got it. That's actually a really good. That's a good one. That's a, that,

96
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,869
I knew what that was just from the shape of the face. Good work.

97
00:23:05,609 --> 00:23:21,480
That was Fred Flintstone. Is it my turn? All right.

98
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:31,220
Hmm. Let's see. I can't talk though. Hmm. I have a ladder. Hmm. Bed, large bed, bunk bed. It's bunk

99
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:45,930
bed. It's bunk bed. It's my, I got it before, but I can't talk. I just can't speak because every

100
00:23:45,930 --> 00:24:04,410
time I talk, I give a hint. Just mute yourself. The next time the words aren't even going to

101
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:20,789
matter because I'm going to do only custom words. Good luck. You can mute the other players. Hi.

102
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:35,740
Hello. Just hello. Once you point to something, it's like, that's it. Game over.

103
00:24:38,089 --> 00:25:15,369
No, that's toggle audio. Just put a face cam over there. I can't do face cam today. Um, uh, basket?

104
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:39,079
A, uh, what the fuck is that? How did I not get this? I don't know. Was it a candle? Oh, right.

105
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:51,109
Okay. It's a glue. Unblock the words at the top. I can't. That's cheating for them.

106
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:55,430
And I don't want to come in last place just because I'm the one that has the screen up.

107
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:13,259
I will get that. Okay. That really does look horrible though. That's just, it just don't look

108
00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:47,609
good at all. It's fireman. There's one of the custom ones. Good. Nice work. All right. What's

109
00:26:47,609 --> 00:27:17,880
this one? Hmm. What is this? That's what it is. Everybody got the word. Hey, good. That's good.

110
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:24,819
Just block where you type. Well, you'll be able to see what everyone else is writing. I don't want

111
00:27:24,819 --> 00:27:39,240
you. I don't want anyone to come close. Yeah. But that lets people write this view. I know.

112
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:46,519
Why are you blocking the answers? I've seen this like 15 times already. You understand?

113
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:04,779
Everyone's screen looks like yours. I'm talking about your screen and my screen.

114
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:26,839
I've seen pee-pee poo-poo like seven times. You guys are distracting me.

115
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:41,660
Did I get it? I don't know if I did it fast enough. I don't think I did it fast enough.

116
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:55,019
It was like a one frame, I think. It doesn't matter. Okay. We're good. No, it don't matter.

117
00:28:55,019 --> 00:29:02,579
Nah, it doesn't fucking matter. I didn't look. All right. But the people that didn't look,

118
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:42,619
I'm doing it. I didn't have very much time. Why are you thumbing me down? Yeah, he would.

119
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:56,329
And you want to tell me why are you blocking this? Yeah. You should only be blocking the chat

120
00:29:56,329 --> 00:30:02,950
window for you. Heaven forbid somebody writes everyone right forehead and I look over here

121
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:52,089
and that's all I see. Village. Got it. At the last fucking second. How about what? It's not

122
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:54,549
what? Oh, that's pretty good. Incognito. I'm too innocent to know. Yeah, but incognito. Guys,

123
00:31:56,309 --> 00:32:21,000
you don't need incognito when you live alone. Okay. What is this? What is going on right now?

124
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:42,920
I think is this like a zoo? Is it a giraffe? A t-shirt? What is that? It's supposed to be a zebra.

125
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:58,019
This is great. Um, I don't, it's a movie?

126
00:32:58,259 --> 00:33:11,240
Oh, that was, that was, that was, that was adorable. That was awesome.

127
00:33:27,819 --> 00:33:55,109
Hell, what? Hello? You're not going to write the whole fucking thing, are you? No.

128
00:34:00,089 --> 00:34:08,900
Uh, yes, that was, that was Minecraft. All you had to do was write, hello, ladies and gentlemen,

129
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:17,139
and everybody in this room, or at least most of them. All right, my turn is coming up soon,

130
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:45,820
right? A, I knew it immediately. It was the shape of the hat. We just got five community

131
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:56,869
subs coming in from Jerma sucks. Thank you. Jerma sucks for the five subs. Appreciate that. Thank

132
00:34:56,869 --> 00:35:26,599
you. I can make a fire with how fast I'm doing that. Pretty good. Pretty good.

133
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:36,219
Mm hmm. This is nice. I'm, this is relaxing. I need this. You know what I mean? I needed this

134
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:57,340
right now. All right, we've got a guy. T. Is that a T? Is that supposed to be T pose? Why is this

135
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:27,619
person huge? Uh, are they playing like poker? Food catering service? What can I do? Restaurant.

136
00:36:28,889 --> 00:36:31,449
Well, I thought it was something to do with like how big this guy was.

137
00:36:32,409 --> 00:36:50,969
Jerma, Jerma, that's the, you just, you did, that's the, you're not doing the American way

138
00:36:50,969 --> 00:37:18,139
to spell gray. What is, um, yep. Good. Got it. That is the god of all gods of lightning.

139
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,380
That was a good one. You can cap that one if you want to use it for whatever you want.

140
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:34,460
It's completely royalty free by the way. That's royalty free. You can use that anywhere.

141
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,519
How, why would you already just guess this? This person just gets McDonald's immediately. Like,

142
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:54,010
come on. Don't be that guy on win, lose, or draw that hits the buzzer and just yells out a word.

143
00:37:54,730 --> 00:38:08,219
And then they have to like pause the show. Ooh, it was tricky. Um,

144
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:29,719
what threw me off on this one was it wasn't a soda. It was a hard apple cider from what I remember.

145
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:55,449
Is the keyboard mega space bar. Sometimes I wish I had a mega space bar. If I, if there was a giant

146
00:38:55,449 --> 00:39:05,590
space bar, that should kind of be pretty cool. Why? Cause it'd be like, you could put, I would

147
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:11,130
love just like a button right here, like a big one right underneath the space bar. I, you know,

148
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:18,500
I wish there was a second space bar. Hold on a second here. Uh, this is my idea. Whoever does

149
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:23,539
this later on down the road, if you're a company, I want 5% of all sales because that's bullshit.

150
00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:27,219
You know where you got it from. I want a space bar under the space bar, two space bars,

151
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:34,699
two of them, one, two. You know how awesome it would be to map something to the second

152
00:39:34,699 --> 00:39:40,739
space bar that's right underneath. I'm talking, we're talking crouches, jumps, slides,

153
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:50,139
even if you put a button underneath alt. So I'm talking, we're talking either between alt

154
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:57,500
and space bar have like one little long little log here. So you can just be like bang, bang on alt.

155
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:06,780
Oh, no, no, no, not a split space bar. Yuck. That's uh, you just made me almost fucking throw

156
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:17,670
up when you said that. It's my turn. No, it's not. I'm talking space bar, space bar. Cover my,

157
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:37,690
I'm going to cut. I know, I know, I know. All right. I'm covering. Uh, the answer was fortress,

158
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:47,500
by the way. Pretty good way to get fortress. All right. It's my turn. Nobody can see. Perfect.

159
00:40:49,300 --> 00:41:10,699
Ooh, okay. These are all awful. Uh, that's it. That's it. That's all you, that's it. That's it.

160
00:41:10,699 --> 00:41:52,230
It's, that's it. That is it. There's no other good way to do that. I'm trying to make fuss stuff.

161
00:41:52,949 --> 00:42:08,519
It was bench. Yes. Hey, there it is. Game over. I lose. Thank you everybody for playing.

162
00:42:10,659 --> 00:42:27,719
None of these come up. What's Jerma Odin? I don't know. I was going to see what they thought it was.

163
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:36,630
I'm going to do custom words exclusively. Uh, I'm going to make a new room and a new link,

164
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:41,699
by the way. Yeah. I leaked the invite. That's the doubt. I'm making a new room.

165
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:55,510
So I'm going to do exclusively custom words. Chat. What do you mean I leaked the room?

166
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:04,789
I'm going to make a new, I'm making a new lobby. Okay. Um, I would like it if you guys could just

167
00:43:04,789 --> 00:43:08,309
write fucking anything you want in this chat, random words that I'm going to put in here.

168
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:34,280
I'm just going to start typing. I'm not putting that in.

169
00:43:41,059 --> 00:44:13,289
All right. Quit stop joining the lobby. Okay. Okay. I can't believe I just fucking wrote that,

170
00:44:13,289 --> 00:44:58,329
but all right. This is going to be terrible. It has to be one word guys. Okay. All right. A

171
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:28,869
couple more and then we'll be good. All right. That's it. This is more of just an experiment

172
00:45:28,869 --> 00:45:42,710
from me because these are, I, how the fuck are you going to draw half of these? All right,

173
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:52,469
let's go. I'm going to put into the sub discord right now. That's right. That's right. Here it

174
00:45:52,469 --> 00:46:04,099
comes. You better stop spamming. How the fuck did somebody get in here as impossible? No,

175
00:46:04,099 --> 00:46:16,250
nevermind. We're good. All right. So here it comes. And you're already, by the way,

176
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:20,010
if you don't behave and play by the rules, I will permanently ban you from the website.

177
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:40,329
Okay. Good. Sounds good. Three, two, one, go ahead and come in. I'm about to start the game.

178
00:46:40,889 --> 00:46:56,469
Everything's in the right place. We're using custom words exclusively. Here we go.

179
00:46:56,469 --> 00:47:04,949
Round one. Good luck and have fun. Don't get yourself permanently banned from the website,

180
00:47:04,949 --> 00:47:26,630
please. I made these. So why wouldn't I know? I made all these. If I don't come in at least

181
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:31,030
second or fourth, if I don't come between two and five, then like I may as well just

182
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:43,699
never play a game like this again. I know all the words, all of them, but I mean, I don't know

183
00:47:43,699 --> 00:47:48,179
what they, I have no idea because it's very possible that people were going to draw something

184
00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:59,699
that is not, there's no sound. Oh shit. Sorry. I'm, I want to see how people do this though.

185
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:24,139
The thing is I kind of, I don't think, I don't remember the words I put in.

186
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:44,500
How are people getting this already? What? It's the chin. Damn. I didn't think you guys were

187
00:48:44,500 --> 00:49:02,679
going to get that that fast. I'm giving everybody a head start. It's coffee. I just said it. Whatever.

188
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:10,579
Wait, it's going to be my turn to draw here in a little bit. No, not at all.

189
00:49:16,309 --> 00:49:20,230
Don't lose. I'm going to lose because of what? I'm just going to just win every round by just

190
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:26,980
typing in the words I know I wrote down. That'd be a bad idea. I want to see how people draw

191
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:37,940
and if people can get it. This is just one of the, this is a random word that I just

192
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:54,650
wrote from chat. That's it. This is not like a stream reference. It's just a bulldozer.

193
00:49:55,210 --> 00:50:05,110
This is it. I just somebody said bulldozer. That's actually kind of hard to draw. I guess.

194
00:50:05,829 --> 00:50:23,659
All right. What do you got? How do I not get that faster than anybody else?

195
00:50:23,659 --> 00:50:38,360
Of course that is just so recognizable at this point. See if I had, wait, what is this one?

196
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:46,630
Is this cheese? Did I write cheese down? Did I? No, I didn't. What is this?

197
00:50:49,340 --> 00:51:06,280
Is this a Spongebob thing? What is this? I don't know what it is.

198
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:27,699
This is the worst emote on Twitch. Press L3.

199
00:51:30,659 --> 00:51:49,400
Press it. All right. I press it. Nothing happened. I don't know what this one is.

200
00:51:50,840 --> 00:52:21,530
Lettuce? What is this? What is this? I didn't put like the Joker here. I don't know what this is.

201
00:52:23,059 --> 00:52:59,159
Oh, gamer. I don't remember what I wrote. Like instantly. All you have to do is put the blue

202
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:16,710
on somebody's eye. What is he holding? A horseshoe? Does Sans play horseshoes?

203
00:53:18,730 --> 00:54:04,219
What? Why am I guessing like I don't know? It's not like baby. What is this? What did I write?

204
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:17,190
Oh, all you needed was the nose and the eyes. Wait, his eyes aren't like that?

205
00:54:19,179 --> 00:54:25,099
That's not what Elmo looks like. That was so all over the place. I put this down,

206
00:54:25,099 --> 00:55:09,159
but I didn't know what Muppet that was. It's not Qbert. Qbert. No, that's not Trollface.

207
00:55:11,719 --> 00:55:43,559
That's Jerm of Venus. Or Qbert. Jerm of Qbert. Yeah, it's me next. What's this? What are you

208
00:55:43,559 --> 00:56:07,539
doing? What are you doing? Is this? It's Garfield. It's not Garfield. What is that?

209
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:20,579
Reckles? I don't know. What did I write? Let me see what the word is. It's supposed to be...

210
00:56:20,579 --> 00:56:34,260
Okay, that was supposed to be bald. I must have pressed S. I don't even know why.

211
00:56:34,260 --> 00:57:50,519
All right, I gotta... What color is his fucking hair? I need... Come on, somebody. Anybody.

212
00:57:51,909 --> 00:58:16,570
Nobody. It's Austin Powers. But I did have a space. Why am I getting a repeat?

213
00:58:18,869 --> 00:58:24,340
I picked these words. I picked... No, I didn't. Well, okay, I picked them, but I didn't...

214
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:28,820
I picked them, but I didn't make them. Somebody wrote that in chat and I was like,

215
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:31,699
all right, put it in it. Of course, I get it. It's the hardest one so far.

216
00:58:32,260 --> 00:59:05,719
Are we just restarting? Did I not put enough words? We need more words. Ten words. Is this

217
00:59:05,719 --> 00:59:37,079
a new word? Me? I don't understand. Money? Money. What? I don't know. Oh, all right. I got it. Yep.

218
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:49,880
All right. That's Vegas. Pointing at me. What? Oh, that's supposed to be the Luxor.

219
00:59:51,260 --> 01:00:14,710
That's the Luxor and the Stratosphere. No, we were Las Vegas, maybe. Uh, tube? Oh, did I... No,

220
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:19,960
I didn't. Wait. Who is that? I don't know who the fuck that's supposed to be. I thought it was

221
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:38,760
Thanos. I saw the hand like... Okay, it's fine. Now I get it. He's got a big Thanos chin though.

222
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:55,130
Chin? Yeah, this right here. Look. What do you mean he has no chin? Look at that. It's a defined jaw

223
01:00:55,130 --> 01:01:17,019
bone right here. It's Cheetos. That's a big Cheeto. Imagine opening up a bag of Cheetos and you get

224
01:01:17,019 --> 01:01:38,420
one like that. That would have at least... That would have at least 1,500 likes. Imagine you open

225
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:44,699
a bag and it's just one big Cheeto. I'm surprised they haven't done some stupid meme bullshit like

226
01:01:44,699 --> 01:02:21,429
that yet. What is this? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Nvidia. That's good. I like it.

227
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:48,869
You didn't even get to draw anything. You just had to... What? Why is it Nvidia every time?

228
01:02:56,090 --> 01:03:27,530
Shit, everyone was ready for it. Oh, gg at at at gg. What's this math problem? Gg at times

229
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:52,090
a plus a plus... I don't understand what this is supposed to be. How is that wrong? What the

230
01:03:52,090 --> 01:04:03,639
fuck did I write? What did I do? A good game. A good game. Oh, that's because somebody said

231
01:04:03,719 --> 01:04:08,360
play a good game. And I was like, all right, fine. And I typed in a good game and I thought

232
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:11,079
they were going to draw like a good... Like, I don't know, you're going to draw like the box art

233
01:04:11,079 --> 01:04:31,030
for God of War. It's Peter. That was so funny. Somebody just wrote, you need more words, Peter.

234
01:04:32,679 --> 01:04:49,800
Did you see that over here? Dude, you need more words. What the... Peter! All right, come on. Come

235
01:04:49,800 --> 01:05:40,809
on, Jim. A good game. All right, well, it's pointing at me. For what, though? I wish I had

236
01:05:40,809 --> 01:05:59,719
a word list over here that I could look at because I have no idea. Um, good luck. Is it,

237
01:05:59,719 --> 01:07:18,409
right? That's Jerma Odin. It has to be. Oh, right. Ah! Bro, wah! Fucked it up again. No,

238
01:07:19,929 --> 01:07:24,889
you don't have to do the same one. You don't have to do the same one. Wait, did you get the same one

239
01:07:24,889 --> 01:07:39,429
as the same person? We're starting to fall into who can copy the thing that the word is the best.

240
01:07:39,429 --> 01:07:54,659
I hope I get Peter next time. All right, next time we're going to do one round and I'm going

241
01:07:54,659 --> 01:08:25,529
to write just random fucking nonsense words. NVIDIA, NVIDIA, NVIDIA. At me, chat. At me.

242
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:34,250
How do you draw, Leo? Um, I don't think you do. I think the answer there is you don't.

243
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:44,539
All right, I'm going to make, we're going to do one round. I'm going to get good words next time.

244
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:49,619
If you, if you, if I see more than 50 of these, I'm going to turn the stream off.

245
01:08:49,619 --> 01:09:09,699
Peter. That was a very low effort, Peter, can I say? That was just two little semi-circles and

246
01:09:09,699 --> 01:09:28,180
then eyes. No, not, not Waluigi. It's another, another like big strong purple guy.

247
01:09:28,340 --> 01:10:07,319
How is that more recognizable than an actual container of mustard? Something about that is

248
01:10:07,319 --> 01:10:20,069
not right. Not right. You know what I'm saying? You've warped our minds. What is that neck? Oh,

249
01:10:20,069 --> 01:10:52,380
okay. No, it's, it's not Waluigi, guys. It's another big strong purple guy. I'm trying,

250
01:10:52,380 --> 01:11:01,029
Jerva. Okay, I have to be ready for that, for my turn. Cause I haven't got the answer yet.

251
01:11:01,029 --> 01:11:17,270
Purple guy. I'm trying, Jerva. Okay, I have to be ready for that, for my turn. Cause I am ending

252
01:11:17,270 --> 01:11:47,220
this. Oh, it's, I'm, what? I'm trying, Jerva. I don't understand. Is this just the same one?

253
01:11:51,020 --> 01:12:06,039
You actually, it is. You just did the same thing. What did I tell you? If I was going to get between

254
01:12:06,039 --> 01:12:20,649
two and four, then I may as well never play this again. Um, it's six. No, this isn't, anytime the

255
01:12:20,649 --> 01:13:04,619
arrow points at me, it's automatically Vegas. Yeah, I know it. Oh, what? Was it my turn? It's

256
01:13:04,619 --> 01:13:15,270
my turn. No, it's not pointing at me. What's going on? Where was my turn? What? Did it skip me?

257
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:43,289
Hi. All right. It's my turn coming up next. This is deteriorating. This is deteriorating.

258
01:13:44,380 --> 01:14:45,100
No, I don't. Okay. My turn. Come on. There it is. Jerva Venus. Nice work. Nice work. Number one,

259
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:55,159
number two, number six is me. All right. Okay. I came between two and six. Oh, I, I fucking leaked

260
01:14:55,159 --> 01:15:00,020
it. All right. Let's do it one more time. This time we're going to do one round or two rounds.

261
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:05,989
We'll do two rounds. We're going to do a new word list. Right. Okay. I got to

262
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:18,539
mute that. New word list. I'm going to make this hard for you guys. I'm going to make it hard for

263
01:15:18,539 --> 01:15:43,270
me too. Okay. Let me think of some other ones. Yeah. We need like, we need about 20, 20 words

264
01:15:43,270 --> 01:16:25,739
because it's two rounds. How about, um, okay. How do you spell that name? I don't know. I actually

265
01:16:25,739 --> 01:16:28,060
don't know how to spell that, but we're just going to do that that way. Who cares?

266
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:51,960
Uh, I don't know. No, why would anyone know that but me? Nobody would know the answer to that.

267
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:54,439
There's no, it's impossible for someone to get that. We're going to keep it.

268
01:16:55,159 --> 01:17:18,760
This is our, some of these are impossible. So how about, um, let's, let's throw a couple of

269
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:26,489
good ones in here. There's a different, just to make sure everyone was aware. These are different

270
01:17:26,489 --> 01:17:55,819
words. Don't do balls this time. I won't call this one 10 out of 10 streaming. Oh no. You saying

271
01:17:55,819 --> 01:18:02,729
that this is a 10 out of 10 stream? Thanks. I appreciate that. All right. We got one, two,

272
01:18:02,729 --> 01:18:08,729
three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 30, 14, 15, 16, 17, three more.

273
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:46,970
Some of you guys, come on, give me some better ones than this. All right. This is good. Yeah.

274
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:58,760
This would be hard. All right. That's good. I'm ready. I'm going to remake the room. Hey,

275
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:11,829
everybody in the sub channel, get ready. It's coming in right now. Two rounds, custom words

276
01:19:11,829 --> 01:19:22,090
only. There you go. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Now I freaked everybody out. Didn't put it in yet.

277
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:58,920
It's in the now. You ready? Somebody left. Let's go. Good luck. Some of these are not possible

278
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:30,090
for anyone to get. They're just not even real mobile. What is that? Is that a person? Oh,

279
01:20:31,380 --> 01:21:00,020
do, do bopping. Is it a grimace? No, there is no grimace in this. I promise. Now I get it.

280
01:21:17,619 --> 01:21:24,359
It's dancing. I know it's a boring. I know you gotta throw a few boring ones in. They can't all be

281
01:21:25,239 --> 01:21:49,640
like fucking Jerma Odin. All you need is just that. All you need to,

282
01:21:50,600 --> 01:22:11,659
you need the left ear to be drawn. I don't even know what he wears for clothes. By the way,

283
01:22:11,659 --> 01:22:15,420
I think I spelled his name wrong. I don't, I think it's Griffin, not Griffon.

284
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:19,899
You got to take that into consideration though, that it's going to be wrong.

285
01:22:22,199 --> 01:22:53,479
That's where the difficulty comes in. This is, this is, I mean, there, there you go. Now that's

286
01:22:53,479 --> 01:22:59,319
better. Now that's better. That looks like somebody's pressing their face up against glass and doing like

287
01:22:59,319 --> 01:23:28,300
the somebody left back to back. I didn't know they were going to be back to back like that.

288
01:23:28,859 --> 01:23:40,039
I thought they were going to spread out somewhere. No one's going to get this. Really?

289
01:23:49,819 --> 01:24:14,899
It's a kitten, a cat and kitten. I wanted to try to throw you off a little very quick. Good job.

290
01:24:14,899 --> 01:24:27,989
And that's me. If you don't know, I'm up in the top right corner. It's a toy boat. It's a toy boat,

291
01:24:27,989 --> 01:24:32,949
toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat. Oh, I am so good at what I do.

292
01:24:32,949 --> 01:24:54,039
It's unbelievable sometimes. Imagine having a barometer for success and how good you are at

293
01:24:54,039 --> 01:25:14,039
something by being able to do toy boat like 10 times in a row. No, yes, I do. Yes, I do.

294
01:25:24,359 --> 01:25:27,800
It looks like powdered toast, man.

295
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:52,630
Yeah, that is good work. That's super Peter. Is it my turn? No, not yet.

296
01:25:57,819 --> 01:26:13,510
Damn, what's with the double face? What is if two faces? I can't even write it. I can't write it.

297
01:26:13,510 --> 01:26:26,090
It's again. No, what that means, we're not going to get to this one. That's not going to be shown.

298
01:26:26,729 --> 01:26:53,289
It better not be super Peter again. If it is, I'm gonna be fucking actually upset. It's not pants,

299
01:26:54,579 --> 01:27:22,979
clothes, clothing, clothing gone. Okay. Yeah, I didn't know what this is reference to. So I

300
01:27:22,979 --> 01:27:36,279
needed to wait for the J to know what it was. There's a Jojo. My turn. No, that's that's that's

301
01:27:36,279 --> 01:28:08,939
your name is germite. Not that thought that was me. Okay, seeing if people get it. I waited. I

302
01:28:08,939 --> 01:28:27,720
gave enough time for that. Come on. Come on, guys. What's in between those two pieces of bread?

303
01:28:32,680 --> 01:29:47,689
McChicken. My turn. I don't know. Streaming, land gaming. No, that's that's that's twitchy,

304
01:29:47,689 --> 01:30:24,979
whatever their name is. No, it's a big old box. How on earth would you get that unless you were me

305
01:30:24,979 --> 01:30:32,840
knowing that this is not possible to know unless you are the person that typed this in.

306
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:45,750
That's Jerma Stewie and emote. No one wouldn't have you would not how would you ever write that?

307
01:30:46,390 --> 01:31:15,460
I think my favorite is super Peter. That's my favorite one. No, I know this one. I will cheat

308
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:26,229
to first place. Don't matter. It's just fun to see how you guys interpret these. You got to get it

309
01:31:26,229 --> 01:31:36,760
right. You got to get it right. That's me. You just drew me. What the fuck? That's pretty close.

310
01:31:37,899 --> 01:31:54,310
Holy shit. That's I gotta go. I got it's not I got to go. It's I gotta go. That's how I type it

311
01:31:54,310 --> 01:32:11,859
every time I write it. That's what those two are talking in the discord channel together.

312
01:32:29,430 --> 01:32:46,199
Wait, this is what's happening right now. Oh, right. I forgot I wrote that. Nice. Good work.

313
01:32:46,199 --> 01:33:03,529
I forgot this. Oh, yeah, the word pool that you get on. Didn't you get this last time too?

314
01:33:06,119 --> 01:33:12,310
Yeah, you got this last time. How out of what's the probability you get in that again,

315
01:33:12,310 --> 01:33:31,270
twice in a row? It's 100%. That's the chance 5050. I love even though you know you still finish the

316
01:33:31,270 --> 01:33:58,890
job. I respect that you still finish the job. All right, I'm gonna give you a little I'm gonna

317
01:33:58,890 --> 01:34:08,409
give you a small amount of criticism here. The button I think the bun should be I'm just kidding.

318
01:34:08,409 --> 01:34:24,840
I'm kidding. There's no. This is perfect. This is good. Yeah, that's good. Nice work. Toxic. No,

319
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:51,060
I didn't say anything. Not I there are enough words. There are like 2324 words. It just keeps

320
01:34:51,060 --> 01:35:00,649
giving us super Peter. That person's like, wait, oh shit, that's what it was. Super Peter.

321
01:35:05,779 --> 01:35:10,739
There's a one out of 24 chance that we're gonna get super Peter. We've got it like five times.

322
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:21,079
Oh wait, they're picking the right. They're picking the words right. I forgot. Yeah, that's

323
01:35:21,079 --> 01:35:39,640
true. Why you guys keep picking super Peter? Because it's funny. Yeah, it kind of is. You're right.

324
01:35:47,340 --> 01:35:57,460
Hi with the camera. Nice. All right, green. We're about to round this out.

325
01:36:24,859 --> 01:36:51,500
Why are you giving him a cape? This is not super Stewie. It's Jerma Stewie. Did I get it wrong?

326
01:36:52,420 --> 01:37:07,640
What? Oh, no shit. It's stuck. There are there are plenty of words. People keep picking Stewie

327
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:19,350
Griffin and Peter Griffin. Someone left. They're like, fuck this. This sucks.

328
01:37:42,619 --> 01:37:46,619
See that guy? That guy over there guessed to it and they guessed something that they shouldn't.

329
01:37:47,579 --> 01:38:08,810
I don't even know what this is supposed to be. Awful. Oh, oh, oh, fuck. Oh, fuck me.

330
01:38:08,810 --> 01:38:24,340
Wait. What? I didn't see this movie. You didn't have to see this movie.

331
01:38:28,600 --> 01:39:00,060
That's Jerma Odin. All right. No, it's not me. That's like green. I don't know why I put so

332
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:03,979
many of these in. I should have known that people were just going to fucking pick them every time.

333
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:28,779
What is B? That's not balls. B for balls. That's Jerma Peter. All right. I I'm not going to pick

334
01:39:29,420 --> 01:40:22,470
a okay. All right. All right. I got one. I got one and then it goes and then come on.

335
01:40:22,470 --> 01:40:30,699
That's Sauron. Pretty good. I think guys, it wasn't fucking Jerma Stewie again. I win. I win. I win.

336
01:40:30,699 --> 01:40:56,600
I win. Oh, fuck. I want this one. Like, how is anybody going to draw that? The best Disney movie.

337
01:40:56,600 --> 01:41:08,170
I'm surprised nobody got that. There were a lot of like super Peters. It's pronounced Sauron. I

338
01:41:08,170 --> 01:41:16,789
thought it was Sauron. All right. We're going to do the next one. I'm not going to tell you

339
01:41:16,789 --> 01:41:21,609
what the next one is. Thank you for playing everybody. I don't want to tell her what you

340
01:41:21,609 --> 01:41:26,649
guys have the next one is just because it'll I don't want I just want to get in there first.

341
01:41:26,649 --> 01:41:42,899
So so I got I got there's no more blocking. I can delete the blocks. I don't think I need them.

342
01:41:43,779 --> 01:42:13,800
Okay. Am I in? I think so. Okay. This is the doodle place. Whoa. Is that an elephant?

343
01:42:14,439 --> 01:42:31,609
Strawberries. This is where he gets banned. Not because I'm going to I'm drawing my own thing.

344
01:42:32,170 --> 01:43:01,029
All right. This is kind of a small screen. Show skeleton. All right, let's do show the skeleton.

345
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:13,050
That Oh, okay. Cool. And then it should start walking around, right?

346
01:43:13,850 --> 01:43:31,479
How many of these can I make? That doesn't work very well. No, no, no, no. Wait, what was that?

347
01:43:31,479 --> 01:43:43,819
That was like I can do different animation styles. A humanoid. Yeah, I wanted to walk like a human.

348
01:43:44,380 --> 01:44:05,979
Okay, that looks good. By contributing your doodle, you agree that enters the public domain.

349
01:44:08,310 --> 01:44:34,229
Oh, shit, that's public domain. That's my creation. Where is he? Where's my? This is just

350
01:44:34,229 --> 01:44:37,510
the end of Roger Rabbit with all the tunes dancing around to that like

351
01:44:41,430 --> 01:44:55,369
like Mickey Mouse comes out and shit. Like, see, they do even they're doing the same dance.

352
01:44:55,369 --> 01:45:05,029
This is like freaking me out. All right, new doodle. Let's try long legs. There's a shoe.

353
01:45:05,029 --> 01:45:29,449
Another shoe. Can I make the I can't make this bigger. There's a hand. Let's get another hand

354
01:45:29,449 --> 01:45:53,510
and up to the head. That doesn't look bad. No, keep that. That's fine. And then down here,

355
01:45:53,510 --> 01:46:10,180
that looks good. Let's take a look at how it moves around. Fish, a bird. You can make them fly.

356
01:46:10,739 --> 01:46:18,090
This is freaking me out up here. I want to get away from this.

357
01:46:25,659 --> 01:46:37,260
That's awesome. All right, let's go. This is going to be let's do some random names.

358
01:46:40,810 --> 01:46:58,010
How about Eddislug? Okay, fine. This is weird. I was supposed there was audio.

359
01:46:58,010 --> 01:47:12,119
Look at that guy over there. This one's good though. Look at this is like dinosaur.

360
01:47:12,119 --> 01:47:20,149
That was pretty good. This is the realm that Jimmy got sent to.

361
01:47:20,409 --> 01:47:27,770
Jimmy. Don't you mean Jeffrey? No, who was it? Fortnite Jimmy. You can load midi files in. I

362
01:47:27,770 --> 01:47:40,920
don't have any midi files. I want to go get a look at this one. Oh, that I just like teleported off

363
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:48,710
the map. Right. Okay. Well, that's great. You know, it's gonna fucking show up at some point.

364
01:47:50,010 --> 01:47:56,890
And not only that, not only, okay, not only is it it's running, it's running towards me. It is

365
01:47:57,449 --> 01:48:21,420
sprinting towards the camera. Just make a giant shield. I'm gonna make a bird,

366
01:48:21,979 --> 01:48:56,949
a flying bird. This is supposed to be the head. Okay, this is bad. Yeah, it is. Just clear it.

367
01:48:57,670 --> 01:49:20,539
What if I just made like a giant snake? Will the game actually register this? No,

368
01:49:20,619 --> 01:49:51,060
that I'm gonna do. I feel like this is gonna break. No, that doesn't work. Fish register what? No,

369
01:49:51,060 --> 01:49:57,079
no, I'm saying like for the bone. I wish I could do separate bones. You know, I think I can hold on

370
01:49:57,079 --> 01:50:03,319
go back to draw if I do set with segments. So I'm gonna make a huge snake. This is segment number

371
01:50:03,319 --> 01:50:10,579
one up here, which wraps down here into segment number two, which is this now starting segment

372
01:50:10,579 --> 01:50:26,869
number two. Now segment number three, segment number four. Okay, man, I just drew like a P,

373
01:50:26,869 --> 01:50:37,880
but let's see if that works. Holy fuck, that's a lot of subs. More subs from phylactery lich.

374
01:50:39,029 --> 01:50:47,670
Every stream, every stream, phylactery gives 69 subs for the last two or three weeks. It's

375
01:50:47,670 --> 01:50:55,029
fucking crazy. Thank you so much phylactery. It's completely unnecessary, but you continue.

376
01:50:57,850 --> 01:51:08,279
Thank you. That's a huge amount of money every time. Thank you, thank you, thank you. What's

377
01:51:08,279 --> 01:51:23,100
plantoid? Oh, I like that. It's like a big hammer. Yeah, that's a good one. So should I call this the

378
01:51:23,100 --> 01:51:47,819
P hammer? No, I don't know. I freaked out. There's a penis in here. Be careful. Guys, there are

379
01:51:47,819 --> 01:51:56,600
probably a hundred penises in here. So I'm in fact, I don't want to turn around. If I turn around,

380
01:51:56,600 --> 01:52:08,539
I feel like there's going to be four or five penis sprinters. All right, what about what's

381
01:52:08,539 --> 01:52:34,340
going on over here? I like this thing. Hey, the swaying guy is still here. Nope. It's so laggy.

382
01:52:34,340 --> 01:52:59,560
Nope. Why? People fucking like this. Penis sprinter detected. Yeah, that's a cute little,

383
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:08,020
that's a fun little game. It is. We're going to move on. You got to watch out for the fucking

384
01:53:08,020 --> 01:54:02,710
paparazzi penis sprinters. Just leave it here. Grow up. Terror? Make it fly. Oh, that's a good

385
01:54:02,710 --> 01:54:21,100
idea. That's too late. Read. You should be reading too. Enjoy your youth. Grow up. What is this

386
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:30,630
little thing here? Look at how slow this is running. Is that my snake? I think that's mine. I need to

387
01:54:30,630 --> 01:54:55,859
see. No, it's not. Five FPS. Jesus. All right, I'm out of here. This is cool, but I'm out. This is

388
01:54:55,859 --> 01:54:59,300
coming from a guy that streamed full unset. Hey.
