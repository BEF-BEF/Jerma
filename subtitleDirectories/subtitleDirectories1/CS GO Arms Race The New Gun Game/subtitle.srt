00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,730
Hey, what is happening everybody? Jerma here with a Counter-Strike Global Offensive Gameplay Commentary.

2
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:21,760
And this is going to be on the map, the new one, because I actually forget what it's called, but it's a new map on CSGO.

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:29,000
And this is going to be on Arms Race. That is the official title for CSGO's gun game.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,600
Yes, this is gun game. This is the old school gun game, not the new one.

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,600
I think Demolition kind of has a new version of gun game, where you spawn with a new weapon every time you die or something like that.

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,600
But this is the real gun game, which if you don't know, I'll explain it right now.

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:52,950
Every time I kill somebody, whether it's one bullet, two bullets, it doesn't matter. If they die by my hand, I am going to level up, so to speak.

8
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:58,950
The instant they die, I get a brand new gun, and that happens every single time I kill somebody.

9
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,950
After 26 times I kill someone, I'm going to pull out the knife, and that's how you end the game.

10
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:10,189
You have to kill somebody with a knife kill. And how the progression works, it starts out, you get an SMG.

11
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:14,189
Everyone starts off with the same SMG. Everybody has the same progression as well.

12
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,189
It's not, oh, you have a different path, you go down this path, you go down that path.

13
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:25,189
Everybody has the exact same progression. So you all start with an SMG, and as you progress, you get the best SMG.

14
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:32,189
Then you go through the shotguns, then you go through the assault rifles, sniper rifles, machine guns, and then you start at the pistols.

15
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:35,189
And that's where this game mode gets really interesting.

16
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:42,189
Because obviously, if you have a pistol, and you're going after people with machine guns and assault rifles, it can be kind of difficult to get that shot on them.

17
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:46,189
And then after you get through all the pistols, you have to use the knife.

18
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:50,189
And that can be insanely hard to kill anyone with that thing.

19
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:57,189
I have gone probably two or three minutes with that knife out at the top of the leaderboard, and I lose the game.

20
00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:00,560
Our team loses, because I don't end up killing anybody.

21
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,560
And I just brought up teams. I'll cover that for one second here.

22
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,560
Teams, the way they work in this, it's counter-terrorists versus terrorists.

23
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,560
And there's no adding of points, it's just individual.

24
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,560
So if I get 20 points, and my teammate gets 20 points, it's not like, oh, we have 40 points together, we're going to get better guns.

25
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:24,120
So it's just individual, and whoever gets that last kill on either team is going to win it for their team.

26
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:31,120
And something I would really love to see in this game mode is more fleshed out, and not so quick, not so crazy.

27
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,120
I wish there was a game mode, like gun game, or like arms race, whatever you want to call it,

28
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:42,120
where you had to kill like two or three people before you could level up, or you had to get a certain headshot, or you had to get a certain amount of criteria to get the next gun.

29
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,300
The whole shoot somebody, go, go, go, go.

30
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:50,300
As you'll see, I go through like four guns in a row in a less than five second time span.

31
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,300
And that's cool, that's interesting, but I like to enjoy the guns for a little bit.

32
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,300
I like to run around and get some kills, get some shots with them.

33
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,300
But you can't really do that in gun game.

34
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,539
Once you start to, oh, I like the P90, oh, I can't wait to, oh, it's gone.

35
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:04,539
And I understand that's the mode, that's how it works.

36
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:09,539
But it would be cool to get a different kind of gun game, where you get, like I said, different criteria.

37
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:13,539
So it was a little longer, a little more interesting, maybe like capture the flag or something.

38
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:17,900
I don't know, maybe I'm going way too overboard with what I think they should do with gun game.

39
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,900
Nonetheless, this mode is amazingly fun.

40
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,900
You get like three or four friends into one of these lobbies and get on different teams.

41
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,900
And you will see some real rage, you will see some real hilarity.

42
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:35,900
I mean, Burger Boy, if I got Burger Boy into one of these games, he probably would throw up on his computer because he wouldn't be able to handle it.

43
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,900
He would probably scream and punch his monitor through the, oh, it would be ridiculous.

44
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,900
But regardless, if you get a bunch of friends in a lobby, it is a lot of fun.

45
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,900
Everyone's talking trash, everyone's laughing, everyone's having a good time.

46
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,900
And that's what it's all about. That's why I love this game mode.

47
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,900
Just pure chaos and pure fun.

48
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,530
Before this round is over in the next minute or two, I want to bring up something.

49
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,530
I get this asked a lot about Counter-Strike.

50
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,530
And I want to answer it, I can't really answer it, but I would like to give you my opinion on it.

51
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,830
And it's how much is CSGO going to cost when it releases?

52
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,830
Now, I have no idea.

53
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,830
The only thing I can really say about that is there is no single player.

54
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:15,830
There is nothing in this game besides the multiplayer.

55
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:22,829
So if you take that into consideration, I personally do not think this game will be more than $50.

56
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,829
I don't think it'll be more than $40.

57
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:30,009
That is my prediction. I'm going to say, German prediction, $40 for CSGO.

58
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:31,009
That's what I think.

59
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:36,009
Now, this could be totally incorrect, because obviously they're developing this game for the console.

60
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:41,009
So this could be $50 or $60 at release, at least for the console version.

61
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:46,009
If you remember Portal 2, Portal 2 was developed for the PC, PS3, and Xbox.

62
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:51,009
And it was $60 for the console, but it was only $45 for the PC.

63
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:53,009
If you pre-ordered it, that was.

64
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:56,180
Which I'm assuming everybody did. I know I did.

65
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,490
So assume it'll be something like that. Same type of hierarchy there.

66
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,860
It'll be somewhere around that range, in my opinion.

67
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,860
So that's going to wrap up this video, guys. Thank you so much for watching.

68
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,860
I don't get the knife kill. I went like 26 and 13 or 14 or something, which is pretty good.

69
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,860
It's okay, at least.

70
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,860
But yeah, this is going to be the end, guys. I'll see you all next time.

71
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,860
And take care, everybody.
