00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,310
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Scare Saturdays.

2
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:18,309
This time on Scare Saturday is going to be going through some of the co-op of Cry of Fear with Ster.

3
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:26,489
Now, before anybody asks any questions, this is not going to be a full let's play of Cry of Fear.

4
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:34,490
As much as that would be cool, I would probably rather stream something like that than to upload like 50 episodes of this onto my YouTube channel.

5
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:42,490
But it's about a 15 minute video condensed kind of highlight reel of some of the scares, some of the funny things that happened, some of the happenings we came across.

6
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:49,490
And that's probably what you're going to get. Like I said, I don't want to have a huge let's play on this channel. It's like, you know, 50 episodes long.

7
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:56,490
I've gone down that path before. As a lot of you guys know, I've done some let's plays and yeah, we're on episode 6. I'm done.

8
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:02,490
But with that said, here is the video guys. Not going to take up any more time. I want to get to the content, obviously.

9
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:08,489
So it's been sunny out. Go outside and go get some sunbathing because I'm about to do it right now, baby. Sunbathing.

10
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:16,219
I'm going to turn up. No, don't. Oh, there's a gun. This is my gun. I can't pick up that 30 semi auto. I cannot pick up.

11
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:20,219
I don't know how to equip it. There's a guy. There's a guy. There's a guy. There's a guy over there. There's a guy over here.

12
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:24,659
He's like shifting around like a freak show. Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him. What do you mean?

13
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:32,370
Don't shoot him. It's a freaking neighborhood. What did you do? Do I have no bullets left?

14
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,370
I shot him. Dude, this is such recoil on this gun. It's unbelievable.

15
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,370
Help me. Help me stop shooting this guy. Shoot him, please.

16
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,829
You do it. I have to change my sensitivity. I can't aim like this.

17
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:51,829
And I'm going to figure out how to equip the G43 semi auto. Give me a sec.

18
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:56,829
I'm going to hide in this dark corner. I'll cover you. If I die, this is all on you.

19
00:01:56,829 --> 00:02:00,200
All right. I will cover you. Are you ready now for real?

20
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,200
Okay. This game is really laggy. It is like 30 FPS. You're not joking.

21
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,200
All right. Well, you have to go. There's a guy. There's a guy. You have the gun.

22
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,199
You I have a gun too, but I can't shoot this guy. I just shot him in the balls.

23
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:17,500
These things have. What is that? What do you mean? It's an upside down flying mattress.

24
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,500
What? Where? You don't. Okay. You walk down there.

25
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:32,469
Okay. I do see it. What is her? Is it dead? I don't have any bullets left, by the way.

26
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:38,469
Yeah, that's kind of happening. We should. I think in our inventory we have a night stick.

27
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:42,469
I don't know how to equip these into slots. Oh, you just click them in and click.

28
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:45,469
Yeah, I just did that. If you click in, you can like bring them over to slot one.

29
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:49,469
Slot one is one. Slot two is two. Slot three is three. Okay, I got this.

30
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:56,360
All right. I don't have any bullets, so something's going to jump up.

31
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,789
Wait, did I just get bullets? I did. Didn't I? No, I didn't. That was you reloading.

32
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:27,430
Yeah. Damn it. Get out of here. What? Game over. I'm so scared. Good idea.

33
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:33,310
Okay. I heard somebody. Is that guy throwing a brick at you?

34
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:39,319
I think it was blood, but it looks like a brick. Is there an invisible person?

35
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,319
No, it's the mattress guy. Where is he? Oh, he's right there.

36
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:52,060
Okay. Get out of here. Go back to Ikea. Who thought this was scary?

37
00:03:52,060 --> 00:04:00,729
Go back to Jordan's furniture, you piece of crap. The upside down flying mattress man.

38
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:02,729
That is kind of weird. There's more of them. There's more of them.

39
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:09,909
What do you mean there's more? Where are they? Oh, my God. They're like a flock of crows.

40
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:19,410
Is one of them dead? Yes. All right. That one's not dead.

41
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:25,550
He's still sitting there all mattressy. Something else, something else, something else.

42
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:32,300
I heard it. Don't waste ammo. Don't waste ammo. He's stuck behind the bushes.

43
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:38,439
We don't got to worry about this guy. That guy might be a pain in the ass later.

44
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:42,439
We got to go in this way. There's a person in this house as well.

45
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:48,439
There's something in that house. I can see its head. Get guns ready.

46
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:54,920
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Is she dead? That was my girlfriend, Jerma.

47
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,610
What the hell is that thing from the island of Dr. Moreau?

48
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:04,610
No, that's from XCOM. How many different games of enemies are they going to throw at us?

49
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,610
No, that's the thing from the island of Dr. Moreau. Moreau, not Monroe.

50
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:12,610
Who's the fat actor? I'm scared. I can't think.

51
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:18,870
You got to be as crazy as them. All right. Good. What's this box over here?

52
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:23,620
I don't know. Should we open it? Pageant Boy.

53
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,490
Can we just jump in the car? Nope, that'd be too easy.

54
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:33,199
Door won't budge. None of these doors budge.

55
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:39,410
Holy. Watch out. We got the Freddy Krueger with the hammers.

56
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:43,410
Freddy Krueger that is being electrocuted.

57
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,709
Don't you feel at all cruel for just wailing on the guy?

58
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:57,990
What the fuck is that thing? What is that giant thing?

59
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,990
You want to billy club it? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

60
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,699
I don't know what to do. Should we shoot him?

61
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:12,120
Yeah, I'm shooting him. I got this rifle. I'm out of ammo for it.

62
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:18,160
Should I shoot him in the face? He's dead.

63
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,160
That just kind of legitimately freaked me out when I turned in that corner.

64
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,420
When he dies, why does he crumple up into like a...

65
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,839
What the hell is this? My legs and face. I want to get inside of it.

66
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,839
I go down and do a yoga position when I die.

67
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,839
Crawl inside. I want to see you inside of it.

68
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,839
And his dumb character expression.

69
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:44,579
What do you think you're going to cover me from inside the hole?

70
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:54,279
I'm covering you. Am I on your head?

71
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:57,279
No. How do you get up this?

72
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:02,490
I don't know. I'll give you one hint.

73
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,430
I seriously. OK, you have to sprint and do it.

74
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,860
That was so that was very dramatic for what to see.

75
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,860
You can't do this. I'm sprinting. You got to like sprint.

76
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,660
There you go. You got it. This game is good.

77
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,350
No more noises. Turn off your flashlight.

78
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:32,699
That's completely silent now. Look what you did. Clear.

79
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:35,009
Anything in here? Anything in here?

80
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:38,009
Oh, on the ground right here. Ammo. Mine.

81
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:43,009
Take it good. I still have some shotgun shells left.

82
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:46,009
I'm not concerned about this. What are we inside of right now?

83
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:49,699
Who built this and for what reason? Yeah, I know.

84
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:52,699
Here's my log cabin. You'll get it. You're the shotgun guy.

85
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:55,699
Where is it over there? I get the cover my tail.

86
00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:00,790
You're covering your tail. Here we go. Good.

87
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:06,449
What is this? And where are you? I lost you.

88
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:10,199
Oh, my God. Dude. Where are you?

89
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:16,810
Help me. Where? Oh, my God.

90
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:28,949
Fair. How many ammo? Game over. Game over.

91
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:31,949
Dude, that was ridiculous.

92
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:34,950
Dude, I saw it like the ground was destroyed.

93
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,950
It's like, oh, he fell through these stairs. No problem.

94
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:42,820
I'll go and after him. I fell through the stairs.

95
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,179
Dude, that was so bad because I lost you and that happened.

96
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:50,129
The first time you go ahead without me. See, I need to.

97
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:54,139
Do we seriously have to go up those stairs? I think we have to.

98
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:57,139
I think that's like that's like an event we have to do.

99
00:08:57,139 --> 00:08:59,820
So what we're going to do is we're going to bum rush it.

100
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,700
OK, OK. No, no. Here's the thing.

101
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,700
We need a strategy for this because we can't just go up these stairs.

102
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,700
Don't go yet. Don't know. I'm not going to go.

103
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,700
OK, I'm checking my like which gun is going to be the best gun.

104
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,940
I'm reloading the Glock. I got two pistols.

105
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,179
How do I dual wield these? I don't know.

106
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:22,179
There's a dual wield button, but it like never works for me.

107
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:27,179
Maybe I just was going too fast and we actually don't like you don't have to fall down there.

108
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:29,179
Maybe you can like make it happen and then walk away.

109
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:32,259
All right. Well, whatever happens, I'm coming down after you.

110
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:39,639
Oh, my God. Hold on.

111
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:42,639
You hear them like hustling. Seriously.

112
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:46,570
I searched that I gave me up. That gave me a fucking hot attack.

113
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:50,259
Why are they coming through walls now? It wasn't supposed to.

114
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:53,259
That's the thing. We know what's going to happen. We know they're there.

115
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:57,840
But am I seriously jumping in this first? Go, go.

116
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,460
Hold on. I'm figuring out how to dual wield.

117
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:07,159
Give me a break. That was so stupid. It just came through the wall.

118
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:09,340
How do you do this? I don't know, but we got it.

119
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,340
We have to just do it. There's no there's really no turning back.

120
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:23,429
It didn't happen. God, Jerma, please, Jerma, please.

121
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:26,799
I don't have any bullets in this gun. We got it.

122
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:29,980
There's one more. I hear like the huh.

123
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:34,220
Nope. No, that's it. I can't believe it.

124
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,220
I can't believe we did that. What's what's even back here?

125
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,399
Nothing. We had we had to do that so we could go up the stairs again.

126
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:49,470
No. What are we stuck in here? No, there has to be a way to get through that.

127
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,480
Can we shoot the what?

128
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,980
The accuracy. You are too good.

129
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,980
I hear a bunch of noise. I hear like a swarm of bees.

130
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,440
Oh, no, not the bees. Oh, no. Do you hear like that swarm of bees?

131
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,620
Yeah. Yeah. Get out your billy club for the bees.

132
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:14,139
All right. Let's go. Get in there.

133
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:19,299
Are you kidding me? I don't want to go in here. Do you hear this?

134
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:23,299
That's going to be a chainsaw guy. Oh, my God. It is a chainsaw guy.

135
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:26,610
Let me out. Let me out. Let me out. Let me out. Let me out.

136
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,909
You can't get out now. You commit it here. Here's what you do.

137
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:32,909
OK, let me equip. Am I going to bait this guy for you?

138
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:34,909
Equip this gun. Yeah. And you just bait him.

139
00:11:34,909 --> 00:11:39,860
There's a rifle on the ground at your feet. Oh, I hear him.

140
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,299
Oh, my God. What is he blending? Damn it, man.

141
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:47,299
He's running a blender. I don't know. I don't know if I can bait him back here.

142
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:50,980
You got it. You got it. No, it's just a lady.

143
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,610
Just a stupid, like, lady. There he is. There he is.

144
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:59,830
He killed me. I'm dead. He's going to get you. Oh, my God.

145
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,779
That's so fair. We knew he was there.

146
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:08,470
What are you supposed to do? I don't know.

147
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,470
Can you? Yeah, I got him. I got him. Oh, my God. He's running.

148
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,840
He's running. He can't get through. I don't think he can get through.

149
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,840
I just want to say hello.

150
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,779
I don't have any ammo. Neither do I.

151
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:25,340
What do we do? I don't know.

152
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,350
Is there a door in there? There is.

153
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:32,039
OK, so what we're going to do is we're both going to...

154
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:36,049
Can you can you get in there? Oh, what the...

155
00:12:36,049 --> 00:12:41,139
What the hell? I have no idea what we're going to do in this situation.

156
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:45,860
I think we just have to get here with enough ammo.

157
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,100
That's the only way we'll be like all those ladies we shot.

158
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,590
We should shoot those ladies, Jerma. All right, going in.

159
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:57,429
Oh, my God. He's like...

160
00:12:57,429 --> 00:13:05,009
Oh, my God. That was so dumb.

161
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:09,529
If we want things to get spiced up, you know what we got to do?

162
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:13,279
What we got to do? We got to stop being such little punks.

163
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,279
Here, we got a gun. I'm just going. Let's go.

164
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:19,279
I'm not waiting for you. We're not taking our time. I'm just running.

165
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,580
You're going to run through this? What about the guy with the bag on his head?

166
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,580
I don't know. What about him? What about him?

167
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,580
He just like punched me and I got like drunk.

168
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,580
It's not even a bag. Wait, what is this? Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

169
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:36,190
I'm getting hurt. Yeah, I am. What is hitting me?

170
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,190
No, it's this guy. Is he breathing on us too hard?

171
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:43,190
I don't know, but his like bad breath is giving us like a headache.

172
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:49,570
What the hell just happened? I killed him and he's speaker phone the hell out of there.

173
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,570
I don't have any bullets. I need a syringe if we find one.

174
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:56,320
I'm out. I got this assault rifle, but...

175
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:03,190
I am out. I'll take this. I'm dropping this for you. Thank you.

176
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,559
I don't know how quickly you do this because I'm quicking.

177
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,379
I'm going the other way. I'm going the other way.

178
00:14:23,789 --> 00:14:27,789
I don't have any bullets. I don't have any bullets.

179
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:36,240
I have to equip the branch. Where's the branch?

180
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,240
Oh, he's glitched out. Quick, come on.

181
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,610
I'm dead, Jerma. I can't see.

182
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:45,610
You can't see me right here? I can see you standing on me, but that's it.

183
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:56,450
Who else wants some? Oh, yeah, you can dodge.

184
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,450
I forgot about that. Oh, wow, you can.

185
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:04,629
There's the dodge button. That's why my, like, double tap forward or back.

186
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:09,320
Oh, okay. That's why I was like, oh, my character freaked out.

187
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:16,320
I hear the bees. There's the guy.

188
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,090
Oh, Jesus. Game over.
