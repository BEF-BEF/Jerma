1
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:15,609
Okay, I am back and I am ready to play some Armored Core.

2
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:23,050
Somebody asked, is this your first Armored Core game? The answer is yes.

3
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:30,039
And I know. Don't play it like Dark Souls. I know they made this game. Don't play it like Dark Souls.

4
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:35,159
I know you're going to try and you're going to get frustrated. I promise I will not.

5
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:49,609
How does this look? So this is a controller game, right?

6
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:58,140
Everything I've read that this is a controller game. I still want to beat Final Fantasy 16.

7
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:08,120
I don't know what made me think of that. Oh no, my headphone plug is messed up.

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:16,290
Okay, keyboard is better. Controller, controller. I don't know. Let's try it.

9
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:32,609
Okay, let me see. Can you see it? You should see it.

10
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:43,920
Hey, there it is. I'm not playing online. I figured that's probably not.

11
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:51,019
I usually don't play any of these games online. Alright, new game.

12
00:01:51,019 --> 00:02:03,939
That looks good. That's fine. Okay, that's fine.

13
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:22,620
Pilot name. I want it to be a surprise. I'm going to make sure you don't see it.

14
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:46,610
Because I want it to be a surprise. It's probably a cutscene.

15
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:59,599
Am I going to like this game? It's eating a lot of nos.

16
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:25,389
Open mind. Open mind, guys. Come on.

17
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:41,009
More Sekiro than Souls. It's very loud. You are so fucked, dude.

18
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:52,460
Yeah, I've heard all the people compare it. This is what I've been told.

19
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:58,460
This is a different video game. This is not a Souls game.

20
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:07,030
So I'm going to treat it like a completely different video game.

21
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:14,979
It's a completely different franchise. It doesn't have that From Software crispiness.

22
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:31,319
That we're all used to. Let's find out.

23
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:50,230
Looks really good.

24
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:59,180
Okay. Commence mission. Yep, move.

25
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:08,519
That feels fun to play.

26
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:14,490
Okay, so it's a toggle.

27
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:20,009
And that's a jump. And you hold to go up.

28
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:26,980
Got it.

29
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:37,860
How do I turn the gas off?

30
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,230
Okay.

31
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:46,230
Oh.

32
00:05:46,230 --> 00:06:06,490
What's wrong with my weapon?

33
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:18,019
How do I reload? Is there a manual reload?

34
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:22,019
Okay.

35
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:26,389
Okay, so it's lock on.

36
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:31,459
Yeah, lock on. Got it.

37
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:36,339
Hold on.

38
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:49,660
I get it.

39
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:08,089
Okay.

40
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:27,589
Okay, so hold this.

41
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:33,370
Whoa. Okay, that's a slash.

42
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:46,230
Do I have anything on left bumper?

43
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:50,230
Okay.

44
00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:01,339
Okay.

45
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:11,050
What is that?

46
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:34,409
It just started moving. It kind of just started moving on its own.

47
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:44,279
Rollercoaster tracks?

48
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:51,590
I'm sorry. I couldn't see what you wrote. You were banned.

49
00:08:51,590 --> 00:09:16,730
I can't read your message. Something with it.

50
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:26,070
Okay. I get it so far.

51
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:40,259
Okay.

52
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:44,500
Quick boost. Instantly accelerate in any direction, helping you to evade attacks or swiftly close in.

53
00:09:44,500 --> 00:10:14,659
Alright, so it's X as a dash.

54
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:23,899
Cool. I think a lot of people thought I was going to die there, so I win.

55
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:29,539
It doesn't seem like there is a map.

56
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:33,909
Okay.

57
00:10:33,909 --> 00:10:37,909
Oh, that's what happened. Okay.

58
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:53,350
That's what happened last time. I was like, why am I moving automatically?

59
00:10:53,350 --> 00:11:08,440
Let's go. Alright. Gotta make it all the way over there.

60
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:42,250
I've never played any of these games before. No, not as of until right now.

61
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:52,409
Fun. Okay. There's no timer or anything, right?

62
00:11:52,409 --> 00:12:02,330
No, there's not. He did play Metal Wolf. I did play Metal Wolf. It's true.

63
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:37,899
Oh, shit. I'm out of gas. How do I turn the gas off?

64
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:47,299
It's B? Okay. Yep. That's my favorite move so far. I like that one a lot.

65
00:12:47,299 --> 00:13:07,340
The normal boost does not drain energy. That's good to know.

66
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,639
Okay. License code Monkey Gordo. License code extracted from an AC wreck

67
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:16,779
in the contaminated city. Contains the pilot's registration data.

68
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:42,440
Cool. So this is essentially a fast travel.

69
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:50,179
No, it's a salt boost. Right, right. You know what I mean.

70
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:55,580
Does everything reload automatically?

71
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:09,509
Yes. Alright, good. That's all I needed to know.

72
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:18,600
Alright, where we at? Down there. You can also reload it faster.

73
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:27,960
You can manually reload the rifle.

74
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:35,509
G7 Chakra. License expires in 12 hours.

75
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:58,659
I like the flying.

76
00:14:58,659 --> 00:15:10,889
License expired. Somebody said you should

77
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:16,600
use the B type control scheme. It's way better. Is it?

78
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:32,679
I feel like I could get used to this. It's just personal preference.

79
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:42,789
Type B. Quick boost is right trigger.

80
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:48,059
A is boost. I think they're the same.

81
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:53,159
Okay. No, I much prefer it like this.

82
00:15:53,159 --> 00:16:05,830
All the trigger buttons are weapons to me.

83
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:24,889
Alright, where am I going? Can I upgrade that?

84
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:51,129
First thing I'm upgrading. I want that to last much longer.

85
00:16:51,129 --> 00:16:58,759
Oh, shit. That's a bad idea. It's all about moving, moving, moving, moving, moving.

86
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:09,509
30%. That's it? I didn't know that was ammo.

87
00:17:09,509 --> 00:17:23,740
Are you going to get filtered by this game so hard?

88
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:28,039
What does that mean? I've not heard that term before. That's a new

89
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:32,039
From Software Armored Core 6 term that you're using. What is that?

90
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:48,869
You're going to get filtered. What does that mean?

91
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:52,869
Does that mean that I cannot? There's like a gamer filter on this game

92
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:57,240
where it filters out all the non-gamers because what if I can't beat the first

93
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:11,500
boss and I get filtered? Is that what it means?

94
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,799
I haven't even gotten through the tutorial yet. You guys are already

95
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:21,059
saying things that are going to happen on this stream before they've even happened.

96
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:38,279
You've already placed the bets already. I'm going to do just fine.

97
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:59,400
Vertical catapult. This game is harder than Elden Ring. I'm sure it probably

98
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:12,660
has a different category. Here comes the first tutorial boss.

99
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:19,660
I'm going to get filtered because I'm not good enough. This is definitely a boss

100
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:29,589
area. Look at it. Does it make the From Software bird noise though?

101
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:57,049
That's the main question. That sounds like the TikTok

102
00:19:57,049 --> 00:20:03,140
filter. That sounds like the guy on TikTok that's the TTF.

103
00:20:03,140 --> 00:21:02,779
I got filtered.

104
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:28,599
I get it. I'll get it this time. I got three heals now.

105
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:53,049
Here we go. It's all about getting up close. I got it. I got it. I got it.

106
00:21:53,049 --> 00:22:42,630
Damn it. It's alright. Back it up. I'm alright.

107
00:22:42,630 --> 00:23:53,019
I'm fine.

108
00:23:53,019 --> 00:24:16,730
Second try. Is that alright? Did I do good? Did I beat it?

109
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:31,319
That was fun. Gamers are flipping their desks right now.

110
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:48,279
This is a raven? I can see how that would be really

111
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:53,160
difficult. You can die in one hit by those bombs if you don't avoid them.

112
00:24:53,160 --> 00:25:04,980
Chat losing to a retired streamer.

113
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,799
Just because I'm a little older doesn't mean I still got it sometimes.

114
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:18,500
That was enjoyable.

115
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:24,779
I had a lot of fun doing that.

116
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:45,690
How come you sound so sarcastic?

117
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:51,380
Do I? I don't know. I'm just kind of chilling. I don't mean to.

118
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:18,099
It's a little low. I'll turn it up.

119
00:26:18,099 --> 00:26:23,940
The whole point of this game is you upgrade and change out here, right?

120
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:30,539
I'm into that part

121
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:34,710
for sure.

122
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:53,079
You can paint it?

123
00:26:53,079 --> 00:27:02,150
I took the idea.

124
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:16,630
Don't get tied to

125
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:20,630
one build. Always change it to adapt.

126
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:25,319
Okay.

127
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:35,559
Change the title? What is the title right now?

128
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:44,779
Design? Okay. Design.

129
00:27:44,779 --> 00:27:50,410
Assembly. Oh boy, that's a lot of information.

130
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:54,900
Customize AC assemblies using the parts you have available at the assembly menu.

131
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:00,410
Maximum weight.

132
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:11,529
I like this weapon a lot.

133
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:18,630
I don't think I can change this. I can take it off.

134
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:28,180
Definitely don't want to take it off.

135
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:36,890
Oh jeez, that's a lot.

136
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:40,890
I'm going to keep it simple for now.

137
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:47,750
I can read those numbers at the bottom.

138
00:28:47,750 --> 00:29:06,539
We'll stick with that.

139
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:13,079
I could spend all day here.

140
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:49,859
That means I'm angry.

141
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:59,480
Decals.

142
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:06,250
What do I have for regular decals?

143
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:11,900
You can just deck yourself out in a bunch of memes.

144
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:19,240
That's kind of fun.

145
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:25,019
This is all for another time.

146
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:29,640
Create images for use. Manage AC assembly appearance settings.

147
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:35,799
Save and load. You can save each one.

148
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:41,740
Missions. Training.

149
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:48,710
Check incoming jobs and sortie on missions from the missions menu.

150
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:56,730
This is $100,000. This is $68,000.

151
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:02,700
Destroy artillery installations. Do the training first.

152
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:19,529
Land shots on moving enemies.

153
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:23,529
You must pull the trigger while they are within lock-on range.

154
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:29,619
They have to be in the range.

155
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:59,960
They have to be in the circle.

156
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,960
Weapons with magazines will automatically reload when the magazine's ammunition is depleted.

157
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,960
Manually reload before engaging the enemy to minimize the risk that your attacks will be interrupted by a reload.

158
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:18,920
That's Y plus RT.

159
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:30,900
Missile lock.

160
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:37,619
To use missiles in other homing rounds, keep the enemy on screen until lock-on completes, then fire.

161
00:32:37,619 --> 00:32:43,339
Missile weapons are capable of multi-lock.

162
00:32:43,339 --> 00:32:53,299
You can cancel it.

163
00:32:53,299 --> 00:33:11,720
Those all went over there.

164
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:20,230
Melee weapons.

165
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:37,369
You can charge it.

166
00:33:37,369 --> 00:33:47,240
You have to fill up that meter.

167
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,240
I'm imagining some stuff does way more stagger damage.

168
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,980
The machine gun probably doesn't do very much stagger damage.

169
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:05,210
There's a Hitman 3 vision mode.

170
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:27,269
Melee weapons do a lot of stagger.

171
00:34:27,269 --> 00:34:59,829
Slashing twice.

172
00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:13,420
The new machine gun.

173
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:20,280
Less attack power.

174
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:30,329
I could put it on the other arm.

175
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:38,070
The bar is increasing.

176
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:56,300
I'll try it.

177
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:10,630
Is that it for the training?

178
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:18,619
Which one of these is a good mission for me to try?

179
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:40,489
Let's go to this one.

180
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:52,070
Let's go slowly.

181
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:22,420
I like in the middle of that.

182
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:29,030
Have a good one.

183
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:33,030
Destroy all Rubicon Liberation Front artillery installations.

184
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:51,940
I think I'm just good.

185
00:37:51,940 --> 00:38:01,860
You get more money for more things you kill.

186
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:09,110
I'll just fly around and splash some stuff.

187
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:15,909
Destroy all the stuff.

188
00:38:15,909 --> 00:38:41,510
Destroy all the stuff.

189
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:47,719
Does time matter?

190
00:38:47,719 --> 00:39:25,260
Time to finish.

191
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:44,969
Watch for the boost.

192
00:39:44,969 --> 00:39:55,420
Much time is lost.

193
00:39:55,420 --> 00:40:00,420
Easy.

194
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:23,849
This game gets very fun.

195
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:42,869
Especially when you upgrade.

196
00:40:42,869 --> 00:41:03,219
oh excuse me excuse me that's a lot of shit over there all right I gotta be

197
00:41:03,219 --> 00:41:08,500
careful that's too much stuff all right turn let's chill out for a sec all right

198
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:34,570
here we go oh ouch ow ow ow I'm stuck on the fucking thing what's

199
00:41:34,570 --> 00:42:26,349
happening oh it's a good thought one more that's it right oh all right cool I

200
00:42:26,349 --> 00:42:48,590
just win 120,000 so the missions are kind of snappy then yeah I that's my

201
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:55,800
favorite part about the game so far stuff is just snappy

202
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:01,909
registration number RB call sign Raven your return to mercenary activities has

203
00:43:01,909 --> 00:43:06,219
been acknowledged restoring access to the it's got some from software

204
00:43:06,219 --> 00:43:11,900
equipment a crisp crispness I can't even talk it does have that from software

205
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:32,619
crispness new training I who first rifle and gun sounds kind of fun bazooka

206
00:43:32,619 --> 00:43:47,719
though all right back power huge on the bazooka Christmas in August honestly I

207
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:55,650
feel like that's the kind of weapon I would like to use there's only one how

208
00:43:55,650 --> 00:44:17,900
many shots is it six seven hundred total rounds 105 I think I'm gonna buy the

209
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:32,699
bazooka oh there it is recoil this thing is probably just really good for

210
00:44:32,699 --> 00:44:39,760
finishing stuff off I'm getting the bazooka well there's so much more all

211
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,949
right what it wait wait wait I need simplified info first rifle this is the

212
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:51,260
other hand the other hand right now has the slash on it I don't know if I want

213
00:44:51,260 --> 00:45:02,380
to replace that although an assault rifle would be amazing mmm that would be

214
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:22,480
good too I think I want this I already have one of these though don't I all

215
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:46,300
right we're going bazooka on right hand oh I can't okay no back in it you need

216
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:56,139
one for each hand ah okay that makes sense I'm gonna get it I feel like

217
00:45:56,139 --> 00:45:59,559
having a big bazooka and then having the be able to finish it off with the

218
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:09,199
machine gun is good give it a try I don't have a sword anymore but right

219
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:24,320
different missile launcher pulse shield another missile oh I can do double

220
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:31,619
missile launcher that would be awesome what about the shield what does this do

221
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:42,809
okay so just blocks a bunch of it just block all damage or it's a Perry it's

222
00:46:42,809 --> 00:46:48,329
hard it's Perry I'll just do double missile launcher yeah let's go why not

223
00:46:48,329 --> 00:47:10,190
this is a left bumper right okay there was some new training which I'm gonna do

224
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:45,639
because I want the item charge attacks oh wow okay this thing is disgusting how

225
00:47:45,639 --> 00:47:56,500
many shots does this have four needs to be reloaded got 12 all right what about

226
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:02,829
what happened to my wait a minute what's going on here why is it giving me this

227
00:48:02,829 --> 00:48:16,179
stuff oh it's gonna teach me how to do this attitude control system of a craft

228
00:48:16,179 --> 00:48:19,579
can be compromised by accumulating strain from the impact of repeated

229
00:48:19,579 --> 00:48:26,219
attacks so this is the stagger system so when you get that overloaded you get

230
00:48:26,219 --> 00:48:32,429
into stagger yep that's what I figured it was doing during which time the

231
00:48:32,429 --> 00:48:38,190
afflicted craft will be immobilized and susceptible to critical damage so once

232
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:49,679
you get that stagger that's when you just unload everything during stagger

233
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:54,079
all incoming attacks are treated as direct hits and deal much more damage

234
00:48:54,079 --> 00:49:09,179
okay so you just there okay how long does it last for not very long honestly

235
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:38,690
yeah I think I get it oops uh ACS strain afflicted with it on enemies

236
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:41,889
resets after a brief interval but a portion of that strain will remain

237
00:49:41,889 --> 00:49:46,489
weapons vary in the amount of accumulative strain they inflict with

238
00:49:46,489 --> 00:50:10,360
explosive impact generally leaving the most okay that's quite the strain so

239
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:22,480
this is the boss killer that you need to do this to kill bosses surprise attacks

240
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,619
acts on enemies that are unaware of your presence will inflict greater strain

241
00:50:27,619 --> 00:50:45,610
okay so they're off they're unaware of you oh they're not aware it does do a

242
00:50:45,610 --> 00:51:02,659
lot more shield equipped to the left shoulder can be deployed to reduce

243
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:15,170
incoming damage from ACA ACS strain what's the charge on it so you can do

244
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:47,570
it pretty much instantly by doing it wrong it overheats shield output is

245
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:52,550
maximized for one to two seconds after deployment blocking during the initial

246
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:56,590
guard window can help to minimize incoming damage all right so it is a

247
00:51:56,590 --> 00:52:36,530
parry okay so one two pop I get it cool although I don't have a shield on right

248
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:51,920
now they don't take very much damage in the front of their shield oh I skipped

249
00:52:51,920 --> 00:53:03,369
that shit what did that mean I skipped that what did that say attack while

250
00:53:03,369 --> 00:53:19,480
assault boosted all right got it yep I think I was doing that before though

251
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:50,179
attack well assault boosted gives you more stagger ah linear rifle let's check

252
00:53:50,179 --> 00:54:07,710
it Oh just the regular rifle other arm though probably right no what is it I'm

253
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:11,219
gonna keep what I got that's the tutorial gun it's one you just used in

254
00:54:11,219 --> 00:54:15,139
store okay I see all the charge one all right I actually really like that but

255
00:54:15,139 --> 00:54:49,300
we'll test this out for now I like it

256
00:54:49,300 --> 00:55:33,980
I think it's good it gets better and better down the line missions get better

257
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:38,619
and better how many okay so here's a here's a question how many bosses are in

258
00:55:38,619 --> 00:55:53,659
the game are there like there's a lot cuz I love bosses bosses is my favorite

259
00:55:53,659 --> 00:55:56,300
part about any of the from software games now I know this is not Dark Souls

260
00:55:56,300 --> 00:56:03,039
I know I'm that I was told don't do that is a boss battles a big part of this

261
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:34,320
game yes okay play the game and find out all right let's go so I got a new weapon

262
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:45,010
sure let me can I test it it's one shot and then it reloads what about this one

263
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:52,349
it's just a machine gun I got the double launcher now it's just cool let's see

264
00:56:52,349 --> 00:57:27,260
what happens oh that was a good shot shit I'm trying to hit him with there we

265
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:56,449
go all right cool cool cool cool cool cool I like doing the double bomb look

266
00:57:56,449 --> 00:58:20,699
at that cool all right they come boost is still on wait for reloads let's go

267
00:58:20,860 --> 00:59:14,500
enemy shields analyzed I can't believe I lost to this oh don't fall anybody else

268
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:49,340
oh I did it kind of reminds me of EDF a little bit is that accurate a little bit

269
00:59:50,539 --> 00:59:56,460
when is the next EDF coming out it's out in Japan right now right

270
01:00:02,539 --> 01:00:11,940
he's streaming tonight because he wants to advertise the you twos I actually

271
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:16,820
haven't even done that thanks for reminding me I just I like thanks for

272
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:28,079
the thanks for the reminder access log hunt you've been invited to join log

273
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:44,349
hunt one of all mines mercenary support programs okay I got more money and gone

274
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:51,300
on the right side now you can do double handgun wait wait wait wait wait wait

275
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:56,809
wait wait wait wait what is this pulse shield no I know what that is I can put

276
01:00:56,809 --> 01:01:03,940
a different head on incorporates only the most essential functionality with a

277
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:09,380
minimalist build in keeping with the fangs stout tree slender branches

278
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:24,349
philosophy it's really loud light oh Jesus Christ I did not know you oh okay

279
01:01:24,349 --> 01:01:41,440
it's not just it's everything I get it so you end up making your favorite

280
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:50,500
spore monster right you put the legs on you put the arms on okay but most

281
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:56,570
importantly what does this do for me right now if I were to do that lose a

282
01:01:56,570 --> 01:02:02,599
ton of stability lose a ton of recovery lose a bunch of AP I don't think I'm

283
01:02:02,599 --> 01:02:16,360
gonna mess around with this right now defense and speed press Y on it more

284
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:24,469
explosive defense scan duration is up anti-explosive defense speed boost is

285
01:02:24,469 --> 01:02:35,750
better load better stop overwhelming him it mostly just means light yeah I'm

286
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:48,579
not gonna do that right now but I am going to do this I'm going to save my

287
01:02:48,579 --> 01:03:02,519
money destroy targets destroy enemy AC let's do that transport helicopter one

288
01:03:02,519 --> 01:03:17,250
the important part is actually the legs you can sell items for the same price

289
01:03:17,250 --> 01:04:01,420
you bought them for anything you're not using I'm gonna stick with what I got

290
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:07,670
okay destroy targets destroy all the Rubicon liberation front logistics

291
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:18,139
helicopters I like this game because it's telling me just very direct

292
01:04:18,139 --> 01:04:28,250
instructions kill that thing with the blue target on it I can do that you've

293
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:34,130
given me four buttons and they just kill that thing right there I'm gonna love

294
01:04:34,130 --> 01:05:21,750
this game whoo very nice all right eat another chopper hang on for a sec you

295
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:58,440
watch out hit it yes ready to reload you do not need to change targets for

296
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:15,039
the multi lock ah oh I took too much damage there that was stupid all right

297
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:33,219
let me wait till my stacker goes down I'd let off steam or something I guess

298
01:06:33,219 --> 01:07:28,179
flash damage to oops gotta go in the air oh oh all right I'm starting I'm getting

299
01:07:28,179 --> 01:08:11,070
to feel for it I understand what's going on I think it's really hard damn all

300
01:08:11,070 --> 01:08:41,989
right that wasn't even the target that was optional oh it's fun cool combat

301
01:08:41,989 --> 01:08:49,090
logs give parts should I be looking for those I feel like I haven't scanned the

302
01:08:49,090 --> 01:09:16,250
game once that's a new menu optional mini bosses like that give you logs got

303
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:42,460
you training I like that yeah I like you can replay missions as many times as you

304
01:09:42,460 --> 01:10:00,699
want that's a good feature this might be really stupid but I'm kind of into it

305
01:10:00,699 --> 01:10:27,989
I'm doing double bazooka I would probably use this very well the missiles

306
01:10:27,989 --> 01:10:37,630
are fun to use okay I have enough to unlock a new head this one is more

307
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:45,260
stability more recovery this is the stir one right this is the one that stirs

308
01:10:45,260 --> 01:11:01,000
playing with right now and then there's this one lightweight so I know I have

309
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:07,289
this down to the very very bare bones reduced menu but what is a P stability

310
01:11:07,289 --> 01:11:14,720
and recovery I'm imagining is how I get that one what is stability in AP AP is

311
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:27,859
health and then what is stability armor Oh resilience okay resilience of the

312
01:11:27,859 --> 01:11:34,130
part maximum load doesn't really help oh okay it's kind of it's like a tech

313
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:40,590
armor this is the posture so this is health posture and then healing

314
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:55,300
essentially poise our this is status all right that's a very simplified version

315
01:11:55,300 --> 01:12:04,260
of it I definitely think I want the one that has more health I'm gonna do this

316
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:13,859
one that's a big increase we have a we have a germ a logo oh okay maybe I'll

317
01:12:13,859 --> 01:12:28,689
put it on maybe yeah maybe I'll put it on that sounded so that was like a I did

318
01:12:28,689 --> 01:12:40,029
not mean for that to come out the way that that did all right no I I think I'm

319
01:12:40,029 --> 01:12:48,289
gonna keep playing this game although I did say that for Final Fantasy 16 but

320
01:12:48,289 --> 01:12:52,050
you know we'll see I really I need to play Final Fantasy I really was into it

321
01:12:52,050 --> 01:13:06,329
too I'm getting this one and I'm putting it on so this is heavier but it's a lot

322
01:13:06,329 --> 01:13:15,729
more defense and in health is what I want the head is just for fashion to be

323
01:13:15,729 --> 01:13:30,239
honest okay yeah I don't know much longer I'm gonna be streaming for I

324
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:53,329
planned on like three or four hours tonight

325
01:13:55,890 --> 01:14:14,550
the Zooka strat is gonna go down oh it's not good for this we're never

422
01:50:21,350 --> 01:50:25,630
hundred and seventy thousand dollars in pay with sixty two thousand dollars in

423
01:50:25,630 --> 01:50:33,569
expenses thirty six thousand dollars all right that's where they get you they get

424
01:50:33,569 --> 01:50:43,170
you with the repair costs that's fun though I'm surprised there's checkpoints

425
01:50:43,170 --> 01:50:58,270
that seems pretty new to uh although this is not Dark Souls but you're gonna

426
01:50:58,270 --> 01:51:20,890
need them later oh what the fuck Dark Souls guys made this I will say I feel

427
01:51:20,890 --> 01:51:25,489
like the from software devs are so talented and they've done so many

428
01:51:25,489 --> 01:51:31,159
interesting things do you think that when people say that all Dark Souls the

429
01:51:31,159 --> 01:51:36,880
Dark Souls guys that's like when people come here and say that oh it's the guy

430
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:54,279
it's the sus guy and it's the ball up his ass guy I do more than that being

431
01:51:54,279 --> 01:52:09,460
the sus guy is not like Dark Souls that was not a good comparison you just

432
01:52:09,460 --> 01:52:16,800
equated yourself to from soft no no I am NOT even nearly as talented I don't hold

433
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:29,149
I don't have even a fingernail of talent on the from software devs but I can do

434
01:52:29,149 --> 01:53:06,060
this I don't think very many people can do that that scared this shit out of me

435
01:53:06,060 --> 01:53:14,819
all right that's uh that's gonna be it I'm gonna call it here only plan to be

01:58:09,989 --> 01:58:14,989
definitely stream starfield at least once just because I feel like it's gonna

475
01:58:14,989 --> 01:58:18,869
be one of those games that you're gonna have to play just because of how many

476
01:58:18,869 --> 01:58:34,189
options of things there might be to do I would imagine if after sorcery I don't

477
01:58:34,189 --> 01:58:40,159
really know what else to play we're just gonna play this I was a little concerned

478
01:58:40,159 --> 01:58:43,720
opening it thinking hold on this might not be for me I think it is for me I

479
01:58:43,720 --> 01:58:49,390
think it is very much for me so you are going to see armored core 6 again I had

480
01:58:49,390 --> 01:58:54,199
a great time playing it I'd like to continue playing it I am gonna need your

481
01:58:54,199 --> 01:59:00,090
help though I'm not gonna pretend like I'm gonna do this all on my own I'm

482
01:59:00,090 --> 01:59:11,180
gonna be looking for help especially if I get stuck be feel free backseat when

483
01:59:11,180 --> 01:59:17,760
when it's necessary what about Baldur's Gate 3 I think I'm gonna play Baldur's

484
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:23,939
Gate 3 on my own that's kind of a game I'd like to play just not being on
