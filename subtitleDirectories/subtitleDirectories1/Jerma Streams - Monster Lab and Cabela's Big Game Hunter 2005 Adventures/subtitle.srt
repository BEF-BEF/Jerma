1
00:00:11,320 --> 00:01:13,349
Oops. Okay, hi, hi. There, I'm here now. I gave, there was a spoiler there, but it's okay.

2
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:22,650
That happens when you have the wrong scene selected when you start your live stream. But hi guys,

3
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:32,069
how are you? Welcome back. We're gonna go back to the Wii today. We're gonna play a game called

4
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:40,310
Monster Lab. Will you create the ultimate monster? Perform outrageous experiments. Build your very

5
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:46,069
own mad monsters. Face creepy quests and challenges in the eerie, uncanny valley.

6
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:51,670
And pitch your ultimate creations in fierce combat against the super evil Baron and his

7
00:01:51,670 --> 00:02:04,060
grotesque army of monsters. To the back of the box says, he's finally playing Spore.

8
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:15,050
Oh, this is kind of like Spore, but probably really, really, really dumbed down. The voice

9
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:28,939
today? What the? I didn't do it. I didn't, whatever. Wait, it's because I, are you, wait,

10
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:34,460
do you think that this is normal? Hey, the voice is normal today. This is why, this is how I talk

11
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:44,870
for real. Wait, the fake voice is the real voice. Confused. Just confused the shit out of me.

12
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:58,099
It's a podcast voice. Podcast voice, tuber voice. You call it whatever you want. It is what it is.

13
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:10,569
It is. Podcast. How has nobody done that yet? How is it possible that no one on Twitch

14
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:22,680
has done a podcast? Why, it's so easy. Somebody has done that. Oh, welcome to the podcast?

15
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,719
Like, how the fuck is that not like one of the most popular podcasts on Twitch?

16
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:39,400
Oh, it does exist. It does exist. All right. Well, whatever. Anyways, let's go. Hope you're

17
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:46,919
having a good Saturday afternoon. I know I am. This is Monster Lab for the Nintendo

18
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:57,659
Wiimote. Monster Lab. Hurry up. Hurry up and go. We have to go. Where do you have to go right now?

19
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:10,259
Where are you going? Hurry up. Go, go. I have to go. Where are you going? All right, here we go.

20
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:14,580
This game is like, look at the title of the stream. It's like Battling Mr. Potato Heads.

21
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:20,180
This was a requested video game from the Discord channel. The requested,

22
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:25,129
recommended Discord channel. I recommend if you have anything that you'd like to see.

23
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,490
I always give it a look. TM. And if it's something that I think would be fun,

24
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:36,149
I play it on stream to cure the strap. No, I don't need this. I don't have a strap.

25
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:50,810
This doesn't have a strap. Nunchuck. One of the only games ever that needs it that I've played.

26
00:04:50,810 --> 00:05:12,730
All right, plug it in. Sick. Oh, I thought it was a real place. Who made this game?

27
00:05:15,100 --> 00:07:10,740
What company? Who made this fucking game? Eidos. Hello? What the fuck happened? All right.

28
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:27,610
That was weird. I, uh, I just went to zero for no reason. Hooray. I'll give this one second to make

29
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:40,149
sure it's actually going to work. Reset stream for VOD chat, please. I just did. I just turned off the

30
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:47,689
stream and I turned it back on. So this is, this is technically a new stream. Technically, this is

31
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:52,410
a, I, this is a new live stream to make sure it doesn't fuck everything up to the bottom.

32
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:59,100
All right, let's go. Uh, welcome to the stream. Hey, what's going on? This is, uh, Professor

33
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:07,019
Fuseless. This is, uh, the Wii. Playing the Wii. Welcome to the VOD, everybody. Hi. This is the

34
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:13,899
monster Wii game. Take control of my monster Gorbok and go help the mayor. There are two streams in

35
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:18,860
one fucking day. All right. We got to take, this is a monster fighting game. You make your own

36
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:28,360
fucking monster. You missed the intro. Okay. I'll give you the intro. Uh, think of every

37
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:38,950
Saturday morning cartoon from 1988 to 1992. That's not very much time. 1988 to like 2010.

38
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:43,590
That's not very much time. That was like three years. Actually, you know what? That's probably

39
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:56,629
accurate. This guy's face looks like one of the many photo shops you guys make every fucking

40
00:08:56,629 --> 00:09:03,590
stream of my face. In fact, I'm, I'm, I may in fact believe that somebody made this out. This is me.

41
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:08,809
This is what you guys do. You like drag my nose up and like pull my mouth down every stream.

42
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:19,059
Oh, did you send you, I'm glad you're here. Yeah, here it comes. I know. I know. I know.

43
00:09:21,049 --> 00:09:26,789
They are blocking my path to reelection. All right, let's go. I can't wait to make my own fucking

44
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:32,309
monster. This is the tutorial. Defeat the monsters, blocking the path. You got it.

45
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:38,360
I'm using somebody else's monster. This is like Mario party, right?

46
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:47,929
All right. Is this knack? No, this is not knack. This is monster lab.

47
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:57,639
Warbark versus Mongor. How do you play?

48
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:10,840
Okay. Yep.

49
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,600
The monster icon in the top left corner displays the health of monster parts. They have parts. Okay.

50
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:26,470
Okay. All right. All your limbs can get knocked off.

51
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:36,039
Okay. Why are the robots monsters? That's, is that accurate?

52
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:49,580
Oh shit. This is just the surge. It's the surge too. If you want a torso is do not move the stick.

53
00:10:49,580 --> 00:11:02,919
Okay. So, uh, select an action. Okay. I want to make my own monster. I want to make,

54
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:05,480
I'm going to have like a lizard head. I'm going to have fucking pirate legs.

55
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:17,559
Why would I skip the tutorial? I have no idea how to play. I'm not skipping the fucking tutorial.

56
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:23,370
And battery number tells you how much energy your monster needs to perform an action.

57
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:31,129
Okay. That's, that's your mana. Oh, you actually have to point at shit with the

58
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:43,690
Wii mode. This is their motion control. Okay. It's like an attack action. All right. So

59
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:50,090
low squeeze hook hunt. Oh, I'm selecting the arm. Okay. The head I can do chomp or roar

60
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:59,370
left arm is auto fire legs. We're going with leg sweep. All right. This is pretty cool.

61
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:09,669
He looks like your opponent has a strong face. Why don't you, why don't you face him?

62
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:17,029
Why? You don't need to face him. When you select an action, the parts it targets on the opponent

63
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:28,139
are highlighted. Okay. Find an action that targets the right arm. So this is low squeeze.

64
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:33,419
It's just going for his legs. I squeeze his legs. That's not what I want. Don't wait his right arm.

65
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:41,159
So that means his right, right? His right arm. Oh, auto fire. It does. Can I bite his arm?

66
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:57,419
Face cam or his left arm. I was going to bite him. All right. I'm going to bite him. I'm going to

67
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:06,470
bite him. It does everything bite. All right. I just bit his arm off. Good. But you can grow it.

68
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:24,149
Can you grow arms back? It's actually pretty cool. Oh shit. So your legs become useless.

69
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:33,830
You can't run. Face cam. What can face cam for? What fucking reason do you want to face cam?

70
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:47,740
Why does everything have to be face cam? Yeah. You want a face cam? Fine. Everything's got to

71
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:57,299
have a face cam these days. You get it. You get it for like 20 minutes. All right. Let's go.

72
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:07,899
At the back of the delay. To gain more energy, select the dodge or recharge.

73
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,519
All right. So you have to, you have to actually, you have to spend a turn recharging. This is just

74
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:25,500
like magic the fucking gatherer. All right. Let me, uh, that is like magic the gatherer.

75
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:32,779
Don't you dare minus two that. If you select dodge, your monster gains. All right. We can avoid

76
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:39,179
attacks and attempts to avoid attacks. If you select recharge, you get all energy, but you

77
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:43,500
don't avoid anything. Ooh. All right. This is pretty deep. Select either dodge or recharge.

78
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:51,019
This shit's deep. Some energy. All right. Let's do, dodge is 33 and you can dodge or read. Just

79
00:14:51,019 --> 00:15:03,980
yeah, let's dodge. What was that? We both did it. All right. That's it. Oh wait. Now you just need

80
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:18,409
to know how to win. You're going to destroy the opponent's torso. How's it still delayed? It can't

81
00:15:18,409 --> 00:15:25,850
be. You will be victorious. Now defeat the monster. All right. Let's kill it. All right. Here we go.

82
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:31,460
Uh, just going to bite, bite him in his, just bite him. Bite is the best move in the whole game so

83
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:38,629
far. He's got no arms. What are you going to do? Oh shit. He could spit. He can still spit. All

84
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:54,789
right. Just bite him again. Put your face on the monster's face. There's a half second sound delay.

85
00:15:54,789 --> 00:16:05,269
It's not even how my mic is being delayed by a thousand milliseconds and my cam is being delayed

86
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:17,779
by a thousand milliseconds. It doesn't make any sense. There isn't. It's not. One guy. Oh,

87
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:28,759
fucking one guy. Of course it's one guy. All right. Let's go. Gorbok wins. They tell it.

88
00:16:31,289 --> 00:16:37,299
We got a metal plate. You get currency and money and shit.

89
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:44,889
You're monster has suffered some damage. Use field repair to heal your monster.

90
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:50,009
This is pretty cool. Field repair restores some lost health. And you can restore. Okay. Field

91
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:56,649
repair. This is, this is pretty good. Begin field repair by selecting the wrench icon.

92
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:02,649
All right. Well, I got some, I got some stuff. It is actually delayed. What do you want to do?

93
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:31,099
This guy's an overbite. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? You are freaking me

94
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:39,859
out, man. All right. Select a damaged part with the control stick. Swing the wheel in circles

95
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:48,200
to spin the wheel and repair damage. Of course. Okay. What do I want to, what do I want to repair?

96
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:58,900
Three, two. All right. So nothing. Just the torso, right? And the head. That's going to be so annoying

97
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:17,380
after a while. Why are you wearing a Kevlar vest? I, whatever. Let's keep going. I'm interested.

98
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,150
Bingo. I can't wait to make my own monster. What are we going to name it? You guys get to think

99
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:32,259
some good names. You guys get on here. It's a backpack. Yeah. It's a backpack. I'm getting

100
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:36,019
ready for school early. I have to go to school in like 12 hours, but I'm ready. My backpack's

101
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:43,140
fucking ready. I can sleep with this on. All right. Here we go. We got below bog versus gore bog.

102
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:50,339
I'm thinking about that fucking right arm here. Low squeeze. Now let's, let's, let's low squeeze

103
00:18:50,339 --> 00:19:01,579
his legs. Good call. He just kicked me in the fucking head. Okay. I got 71. That was a big move

104
00:19:01,579 --> 00:19:11,940
from him. All right. Low squeeze again. All right. I broke his legs. I'm all right. Look at his,

105
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:28,059
look at his energy. It's terrible. And then we automatically goes to the torso. Okay. So you

106
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:33,480
don't want to be, you really don't want to do that. Okay. Should I just go for it? Hook punch. Let's

107
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:42,059
hook punch him. Take off that arm. See you later. Do I have a mailbox on my arm? All right. What

108
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:51,160
are you going to do with no legs in one arm? Nothing. I need energy. Why am I getting

109
00:19:51,160 --> 00:20:04,470
gears of war vibes from this? Twist him. Yes. You can block. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense.

110
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,500
All right. Inward block. I don't want to do that. He looked at me. I got, I already got him.

111
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:15,930
Upward block. Roar. I don't have enough energy. All right. We're going to dodge.

112
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:25,059
Why do we both have the same idea every time? Oh, right. This is like sorcery, like stamina smash,

113
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:32,380
smash, smash. Hold on. All right. We're going to auto fire. This came out of the wiimote.

114
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:43,819
All right. It was done. Uh, I have no energy. All right. We're going to, I can leg sweep,

115
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:52,710
leg sweep him right in the chest. Optical beam. Oh fuck. I'm almost dead. All right. Uh, dodge.

116
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:04,740
You're going to love, he's a low energy streamer. Chomp. Dead. Holy shit. Wait, whatever. Harold

117
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:13,930
Elbertson. Thank you. Harold Elbertson. Nine eight five for the 10 community subs.

118
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:21,400
Fight him. Uh, Harold Elbertson, nine eight five, 10 community subs. Thanks a lot for those subs.

119
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,960
Also Kazzy gave five community subs. Thanks both of you for the subs. You guys are fucking awesome.

120
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:33,019
Thank you. That's a fucking 15 sub drop from two people. You guys fucking rock. Thank you.

121
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:46,759
Wake up Harold. Oh, you get items. This game rules. I remember playing it on the Nintendo DS.

122
00:21:46,759 --> 00:22:29,400
Thank you. You could call it a hidden gem. That's not funny. That's not funny. Except my thanks.

123
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:35,960
Prefer to return and explore a beautiful village. Oh God. That's disgusting. Oh my God.

124
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:50,170
Return to the castle immediately. No, you're the one laughing because that's insane. Return to the

125
00:22:50,170 --> 00:23:04,279
castle. All right, I'm back. Thanks. Your help was most appreciated. I am Professor Fuseless.

126
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:19,160
It's like, it's like segmented. It's like separated. Oh fuck you. It's coffee. I can't even drink it.

127
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:45,450
It's coffee. Relax. Master of mechanical mad science. Stop. Mad scientist. Oh, here we go.

128
00:23:45,450 --> 00:24:02,380
What's my name? Oh, this is important. Make it poop wine. No. Oh my God. How old are we? How old

129
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:07,819
are we? How old are you? How old am I? That's more important. Forget about you. Forget about

130
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:15,500
fucking how old you are. How old am I? This is like, this is my stream and a 30 fucking plus

131
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:22,779
year old man is going to make his character name poop wine. Just be clear about this. This is my

132
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:46,140
responsibility. Me showing this. Oh my God. No, I can't. That's like, I'm 30 plus. I'm over 30.

133
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:51,019
You can't make these jokes anymore when you turn 35, but I'm not that yet. I'm 30 plus.

134
00:24:51,819 --> 00:25:26,890
Okay. I don't care. Welcome to the mad science alliance apprentice. Poop wine. I was speaking,

135
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:43,769
I was speaking, what's, what's pig Latin? Poop wine pay. Hey, hey. This is a fucking 15,

136
00:25:43,769 --> 00:25:52,700
this is like a 13 year old's stream. Seriously. Seriously say, is say, uh ay,

137
00:25:54,059 --> 00:26:10,279
13 pay, ear yay, full day, frame say. I know he's not speaking in tongues. It's pig Latin.

138
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:14,119
That's like a 12 year old thing. How many of you guys are 12? You don't know how to speak pig Latin?

139
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:27,700
That was like a 12 year old thing. Remember those ingredients you received in tongues.

140
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:38,230
You can view them in your new Igor. Igor is your own personal data management system.

141
00:26:38,950 --> 00:27:02,869
I can't, I can't get over this. You fucked me up for life. You fucked me up for life.

142
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:07,589
Every time I drink a coffee that gets separated like this, but no ice in it,

143
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:13,980
of all I'm going to hear is your, your screaming. You fucked me up for life.

144
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:23,109
Igor tracks your progress as well. Okay. So I got a skull, horn skull,

145
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:30,500
metal platter and thick pipe. Cool. Wait. We can use the ingredients you just saw

146
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:37,740
to make a mechanical part to flatten your opponents. When you want to open Igor,

147
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:45,420
use the minus button. Okay. He drew the workshop. Let me see ingredient received. Thick pipe.

148
00:27:45,579 --> 00:27:55,289
Okay. So quest log, go to the workshop. We also got a scientist data, monsters. You have no monsters

149
00:27:55,289 --> 00:28:00,970
in your inventory. Parts. No parts. Ingredients though. We can make it like a skull pipe person.

150
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:13,099
All right. This is cool. Let's go to the workshop. Make a royal flush. To save your game,

151
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:20,539
select the cat or saver. Right. Save, save the game. Save the game right now, actually, immediately.

152
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:46,420
Save it. Why am I desync? It's off. The audio is early. Oh, we've got to do something here. Okay.

153
00:28:47,779 --> 00:29:02,819
Ready? Hey, one, two, one, two. Hey, hey. So my audio, me saying a is early. It's literally perfect.

154
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:18,569
My audio is early. You fucking with me? It's, this is not one guy. This is like fucking half the chat.

155
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:27,029
It's, this is not one guy. This is like fucking half the chat. This is a lot of one guy. I'm tripping.

156
00:29:34,569 --> 00:29:51,049
My audio is early. Do you hear me first? How's this? How does this sound? Are we good to go?

157
00:29:52,009 --> 00:30:12,490
How does this sound? Are you seeing this sync up? Okay. Good. Yo, shut the fuck up, chat.

158
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:18,180
You're still ugly.

159
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:30,279
Blame God. Okay. That's not my fault. You may use my equipment to perform experience, but be careful.

160
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,269
Oh, you can make it do experiments?

161
00:30:43,109 --> 00:30:45,109
Holy shit, I've really seen that tiny arm.

162
00:30:50,309 --> 00:31:20,519
Experiment and your ingredients will be destroyed. I got to keep this together. I can't.

163
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:47,339
Okay. Ingredients. Key ingredient. We can do, all right, we're going to do a bedpan

164
00:31:48,220 --> 00:32:03,380
and a spool of wire. What do we get? Point the Wii mode and hold the B button to weld.

165
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:10,599
Fill the entire seam for the highest quality. What? A gun, if the gun overheats, you weld

166
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:15,660
outside the seam. A gun overheats if you weld outside the seam. Shake the nunchuck to fix the

167
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:54,119
gun. What am I welding? This is an operation. This shit's tiny. Oh my God. Why do they have

168
00:32:54,119 --> 00:33:03,779
to make it like a tracing game? The worst thing you could possibly do for me is make this be a

169
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:14,420
tracing game. You guys know how much I fucking hate this shit. Wait, in here. This is pretty

170
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:37,400
high quality. It's good, right? Is this the game? I don't think so. Wait, we got a buckler shield.

171
00:33:39,609 --> 00:33:47,430
I get it. Okay. Slow. It's 100% quality. Hit points. 39. So it's a block. It's a shield.

172
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:53,140
That's not bad. Put that shit on.

173
00:33:53,220 --> 00:34:29,210
Hey D ward, thanks for the 10 community subs. How do you attach?

174
00:34:41,019 --> 00:34:45,579
In the lightning tower. Okay. So buckler shield. Let's put it on, right?

175
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:54,380
Speak with useless in the lightning tower. The weldatron. There's a lot in this game. This is

176
00:34:54,380 --> 00:35:15,000
very, very deep. Lightning tower. You have to make your own monster. No, it's not a pog moment.

177
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,920
No, I was thinking about it. It was close.

178
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,280
No doubt there are scrap parts around here for you. I can't. This is going to be so good.

179
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:38,599
Let's make a monster. Monster constructor in the middle of the room. All right. Make a new monster.

180
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:51,739
Okay. This is the monster constructor screen. The panel's on the left. Should I make it all wizard?

181
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,599
Let's just build a monster. Like different areas of your monster.

182
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:08,949
Just like you do in combat. Okay. Right now. All right. Let's do head and legs. Not bad.

183
00:36:08,949 --> 00:36:15,590
Notice how those arrows move when you select a different area. I do. You can use those arrows

184
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:21,989
to choose what parts your monster is using. Make your fursona. Right now your monster isn't using

185
00:36:21,989 --> 00:36:29,670
any part. Push up on the control stick. Point the weave remote at an arrow and press the A button.

186
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:36,820
Okay. We only have two choices for head right now? Push up on the control stick. All right.

187
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:48,599
Get out of the way. See you'll make a monster. I don't want that. I only have two options.

188
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:56,760
You can use that arm you just made. As a test I want to choose the rest. All right. What can I do?

189
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:13,079
Plated jaw, leopard skull, or none? I think I only have two so far. All right. Leopard skull,

190
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:37,019
buckler shield, flub arm, stone hacker, ogre arm. Yep. Ogre arm and uh buckler shield. No.

191
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:49,260
And stone hacker. And scale male body.

192
00:37:50,139 --> 00:38:03,639
When you are ready, select the jaw. With wooden legs? All right. No. We're gonna do tree legs.

193
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:11,159
Do I want the shield? I mean this is the first tutorial monster.

194
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:23,380
Yeah. All right. This is good. Best thing to do. Monster in name. Every monster needs a good name.

195
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:28,619
Like mongor. I'm not gonna name it mongor. All right. I'm not gonna keep this one.

196
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:40,099
This is this this is this shitty tutorial monster. How do I how do I delete? Oh okay.

197
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:50,860
How about how about um how about Mr. Recycle? Because he's just I'm just gonna recycle him

198
00:38:50,860 --> 00:39:01,900
and I'm gonna take all those parts and stuff. Like I'm just gonna recycle him. Mr. Poopster.

199
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:06,539
But he's not getting a poop. Not no. Why would I name everything a poop related thing in this

200
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:22,420
frame? Doesn't even matter. I can name him just like Tim. Or like I don't know like Paul. Or like

201
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:53,019
Tim. Paul. It doesn't none of those matters. None of those matters. How about David? David? Good

202
00:39:53,019 --> 00:40:11,590
enough. All right. Let's take our first monster into combat. Open Igor. Yes.

203
00:40:11,989 --> 00:40:17,829
You want to go to corner shop and get stuff. Now head down to the command room. Deploy the new

204
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:26,659
creation. This is gonna be pretty fun. I got a saw blade. Let's go look at him. There he is.

205
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:31,349
There's David. Actually pretty intimidating looking. Look at his health, his uh mana,

206
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:37,239
his attack, and his defense. Not bad. It's pretty good for a monster that this is what

207
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:51,099
there's only like five combinations. Let's go. Command room deploy him. Shitty. He's shitty.

208
00:40:52,460 --> 00:41:00,659
All right. All right. Command room. I can't wait to make the most boring fucking monster ever.

209
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:12,619
This is the command room. Use the trouble scope to see. Trouble scope? When it's out doing well

210
00:41:12,619 --> 00:41:24,809
monster. Other side of the room is the interlab link. You can use the interlab link to challenge

211
00:41:24,809 --> 00:41:30,010
other scientists. There was internet on this. You could actually fight over the internet.

212
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:34,469
Well that's too bad that Nintendo shut literally all servers down permanently.

213
00:41:36,389 --> 00:41:47,829
That would be fun. Now let's pick a region. We had internet. Yeah it did. Oh my god this is huge.

214
00:41:47,829 --> 00:41:59,110
All right. Cobbleshire. Let's go fight in Cobbleshire. We're taking David. Deploy David.

215
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:13,239
I'm not wearing a tactical rig. Just fire him out of a cannon. All right. We're gonna get parts

216
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:20,809
because I want to make another monster. There he is. All right. Cool. Oh can I like collect

217
00:42:20,809 --> 00:42:26,730
items or something? What's the actual end goal here? Just explore? It doesn't take resources

218
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:40,119
to walk around right? Tourism. We're getting an interesting new visitor. All right. Northeast.

219
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:54,300
All right. Northeast. Let's move. All right. That was like a loud cat noise. This is a cat?

220
00:42:55,619 --> 00:42:59,219
I walked past everything. What am I supposed to just walk into the town?

221
00:43:00,099 --> 00:43:11,530
Uh oh. It's David versus the insane. Shit. Okay. All right. What do I have? What do I do? What can

222
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:18,949
my twigs do? It's just Pokemon.

223
00:43:18,949 --> 00:43:27,590
Okay.

224
00:43:32,389 --> 00:43:47,110
Sure. Cool. So what does he got? What does he what does he got? I got scale male body.

225
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:57,690
All right. Let's do side kick. It hits his his right arm. I could do diagonal chop. This move

226
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:08,949
sucks. Ground pound or block or I could do no optical beam. Optical beam. Well that was that

227
00:44:08,949 --> 00:44:17,559
was destruction. Oh fuck. I took it all right. All right. Hammer fists. What should I try to do?

228
00:44:17,639 --> 00:44:24,760
So his legs are in trouble. His head's in trouble too. Hold on. Can I bite his head? Optical beam

229
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:32,469
again. I knocked his head off. Now what are you gonna do about that? All right. Now we're gonna

230
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:42,860
dodge. It's only plus two. Dodge. All right. He's going for the legs. I gotta stop this.

231
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:57,639
Uh right in the center of his chest. Diagonal chop. Shit. That's not good. That's not good.

232
00:44:57,639 --> 00:45:08,949
Uh I'm not gonna flee. Dodge. Nice. Good work. All right. This is where we end it.

233
00:45:08,949 --> 00:45:17,530
Uh bite him. It doesn't matter. He's dead. Fully recharged. Bite him. He's not dead yet.

234
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:35,079
This is arm. Fuck. Okay. Uh run away. Just recharge fully. The new monster rancher sucks.

235
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:41,239
This isn't even monster rancher. All right. Die. Let's see if I can end it with a hammer fist.

236
00:45:53,159 --> 00:46:00,539
Wins three. Losses zero. This is the first fight. I got a bent screw. So I skipped the fucking

237
00:46:00,539 --> 00:46:11,480
rewards. Whoops. This is the first fight. How do I repair myself? Don't I have to repair?

238
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:26,389
How do I? Where's like the repair shop thing? How do you repair? Go back and get the stuff.

239
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:45,159
What's? How much stuff did I miss? There's nothing even here. I didn't miss anything. This has all

240
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:55,610
the this is a mobile game before it's time. Yeah like the circles. Yeah. Get it. There's nothing

241
00:46:55,610 --> 00:47:06,739
there. How do I how do I repair myself? I'm gonna die. What's like the repair? What's that

242
00:47:06,739 --> 00:47:26,059
repair mini game? Remember? You missed a tinted rock. There he is. I'm not fighting any of this

243
00:47:26,059 --> 00:47:36,389
stuff.

244
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,360
You gotta repair the home day so.

245
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:50,519
The ingredients you discover in a challenge will help you to make new and better monster parts.

246
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:59,380
But I can't seem to remember where I put any of them. Okay complete buried treasure challenge.

247
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:08,920
Electro trace challenge. Buried treasure. How the fuck am I supposed to find that?

248
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:32,699
Wait what is that down there? Why is that lit up? Is this it? Oh I got it. I modified the

249
00:48:32,699 --> 00:48:38,860
telescope to allow you to see. It allows you to control your monster directly.

250
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:43,739
What? Point at the line. Wait electro trace. Not another fucking trace.

251
00:48:44,699 --> 00:48:52,659
Stay as close as you can. Point at the line with the Wii remote and hold down A and B. A or B to

252
00:48:52,659 --> 00:49:15,699
trace. Oh no. Why? No! What the fuck? No! They did it. Okay. Fuck why? It's like almost like

253
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:23,179
they're mocking me. Okay. Electro trace. Don't get don't get any fights. I'm gonna die if I do.

254
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:38,539
Buried treasure is the next one? Oh fuck. Leave me alone. He's playing webkinned. Buried treasure.

255
00:49:38,539 --> 00:50:01,110
No? Let me repair first. He needs to repair. This game is... I'm not even gonna read what you said.

256
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:09,780
All right it's the workshop right? You barely took any damage. Did I? I thought I did.

257
00:50:10,659 --> 00:50:21,820
It's the weldotron right? Wait key ingredient. Saw blade and worn spindle.

258
00:50:23,699 --> 00:51:26,659
Let's go. Let's go. Let's make a new arm. I can't. I'm sorry. Why does it have to be a tracing game?

259
00:51:26,659 --> 00:51:37,989
I thought I was supposed to make monster parts and shit. It's good enough right? Have you ever

260
00:51:37,989 --> 00:51:43,429
welded something before? No I've never welded something before. Why would I have ever welded

261
00:51:43,429 --> 00:51:54,500
something? Oh I got a... what is it? A muffler? What is it? It's a circular saw. It's supercharged.

262
00:51:56,250 --> 00:52:15,340
Increase energy capacity. That's pretty good. How do I repair? Turbocharged backpack. Where's

263
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:36,360
it repair? Lightning tower? How do I actually do this? You probably don't need to. It's done

264
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:42,440
in the field. Well how can I go and see it? All right we need one more. We need one more treasure.

265
00:52:45,369 --> 00:52:52,570
It's the shield and the pause menu. Okay. There goes the rest of the poop wine.

266
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:17,320
Oh I got... I'm good. All right one more uh one more of these quests. This is why I don't have

267
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:23,079
the face game August. Every 15 minutes every like 10 minutes there's gonna be another 20 comments

268
00:53:23,079 --> 00:53:29,130
about why is this guy wearing a backpack? Because I'm preventing it from happening.

269
00:53:29,849 --> 00:53:40,059
All right what about over here? Secret! Swing the weed mode left and right to dig.

270
00:53:41,260 --> 00:54:06,010
Shake the nunchuck to break the skulls. There we go. That's the gig. Got it. I found a flood light.

271
00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:11,349
All right I did you... I did your missions now. Give me your resources.

272
00:54:26,659 --> 00:54:28,980
Hurry back with what you found. You got it.

273
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:44,150
Uh oh. Battle time. Bubbles versus David. Looks like a mirror.

274
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:57,690
All right. What are we going for? Uh diagonal chop. Side kick. Knock that arm off.

275
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:13,340
Do that again. Foster strap. There goes the arm. Laughing my ass off. What the fuck is this?

276
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:42,230
Do I not bite him? Why is this music from Battlefield? Is it actually from what?

277
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:57,579
You're gonna lose? I'm not gonna lose. I'm gonna optical beam him right in his sternum. Oh my god.

278
00:55:57,579 --> 00:56:09,320
I'm gonna lose. I'm actually gonna lose. I'm gonna lose. Uh all right. Here we go. All right we're

279
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:16,780
good. I'm gonna lose to a kids game. This is not even a kids game. This is a fucking rated M.

280
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:34,980
All right here we go. Knock his head off. How did that not do more damage than that?

281
00:56:35,539 --> 00:56:43,980
Dodge again. Fuck. He recharged and I didn't. The crickets and dog barking sounds. I know. I don't

282
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:50,219
understand it either. Try block. I'm gonna pull. Okay I gotta go for a block. I'll go for a block.

283
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:58,789
Block it. Yep. That was the right call. Got him. Fucking so smart. All right now we dodge.

284
00:56:59,829 --> 00:57:06,969
Dodge it. Dodge. Nice. All right. This is where we end it. Right here. I'm gonna hammer fist him.

285
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:22,300
Fuck. He's still. Dodge again. I'm not gonna lose. If I lose in the tutorial I'm taking the disc out

286
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:38,760
and playing something else. Dodge again. All right now bite him. Look at this. Why is this guy? Is

287
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:54,420
this guy like three levels higher than me? I don't understand. He's taking the shit out of me. Do I

288
00:57:54,420 --> 00:58:03,480
beam him? Don't put the bite again. What is he like organic? It's like organic right? Alchemy

289
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:09,900
versus organic. You gotta step it up. I am stepping it up. All right cut his arm off.

290
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:22,550
This is bad. This is actually really bad. Recharge. His chest is alchemical. Is it?

291
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:39,420
All right I win. We're good. It's not over but it will be in a second. All right.

292
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:52,570
Losing to bubbles. Did I? Because I had just won. All right. Metal platter. Horned skull.

293
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:59,179
Mud bucket. All right. We got a mud. I'm thinking mud bucket and horned skull will be all right.

294
00:58:59,739 --> 00:59:11,690
Prepare now. Poop bucket. All right. So where is this? Are you saying it's in the menu?

295
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:29,530
Isn't like the field menu? Field repair kit. I don't see it anywhere. Is it the victory screen? Oh.

296
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:40,809
Well we have to go back and deposit this anyways. So I'm playing this shitty game.

297
00:59:41,769 --> 00:59:56,010
It's looked interesting. This game is pretty fun actually. You don't know until you try. I don't

298
00:59:56,969 --> 01:00:04,309
know how many how many games that were shitty games have we played that turned out to be

299
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:08,789
fucking phenomenal. We gotta give him a chance. You can't just write him off immediately.

300
01:00:10,489 --> 01:00:26,550
You can't just write him off. At least one. You gotta give it like at least 45 minutes

301
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:33,590
till it's been an hour. Okay. You gotta give it at least like you gotta give it at least like an

302
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:41,690
hour and a half before I put in elebits. All right. Will I talk to this guy? You'll want to learn how

303
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:52,969
to make a new monster part. Yes. Go on. I'll meet you in my workshop. You have one life until I have

304
01:00:52,969 --> 01:01:04,119
to change games. That's not fair. At least say something funny. I'm not a fucking woody doll.

305
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:07,429
You don't pull the back of the string and expect it.

306
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:11,820
Uh

307
01:01:17,659 --> 01:01:29,699
Let's see how this fucking works. There's a string on the back of me. That was terrifying.

308
01:01:32,659 --> 01:01:39,539
That was scary. Good. Why does he have that pro? It's just an easy button to press.

309
01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:48,659
I'm going to the workshop and I'm gonna make a new fucking robot part. All right.

310
01:01:49,380 --> 01:02:01,829
We can make the reverb. The reverb was so high on that. The difficulty level of experiments

311
01:02:01,829 --> 01:02:12,139
depends on the ingredient. That was all almost all the way. That was very very very insane. I

312
01:02:12,139 --> 01:02:19,400
didn't even know. Oh well. All right. So don't get ahead of yourself. All right. Here we go.

313
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:38,840
Fortunately. We are aware. All right. Let's do head end and scrap. No no no no no no.

314
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:46,780
Oh you can evolve? This really is a fucking mobile game. Shit. Floodlight and bent screw.

315
01:02:49,929 --> 01:02:55,780
This is bumped you. Sorry. Shit. This is a fucking mobile game. It's like robots with the control

316
01:02:55,780 --> 01:03:05,820
stick swing the remote to smash. Smash all the robots that show the wrong symbol. Complete as

317
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:21,670
many rounds as possible to earn quality. Give me the wrong symbol. Move over. Why can I not move

318
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:32,329
it? No. Move. I moved to the left. I'm trying to. The guys are the wrong symbols. Okay. I gotta. I

319
01:03:32,329 --> 01:03:39,320
gotta smash this guy and the guy over there and the guy over there. How do I move it? Why can I

320
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:55,289
move it? How do I move the fucking thing? You're killing them. I'm trying to fucking use the stick.

321
01:03:57,059 --> 01:04:20,360
I'm pressing everything. Okay here we go. Oops. I'm gonna kill you. This thing's gonna be very low

322
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:54,869
quality. Woody doll. Oh sick. A new helmet. Watch the clip. Hold on. Let me see what the

323
01:04:54,869 --> 01:05:04,440
fuck this looks like. Never welded before. Hold on. Look at a lot of new materials.

324
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:15,900
It's fucked up. Is it that fucked up? Hold on. Let me see how fucking bad this sounds.

325
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:27,940
What a fucking woody doll. You don't pull the back of the string and expect.

326
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:48,500
That's pretty accurate to what they actually sound like. So

327
01:05:49,219 --> 01:06:07,739
they're not that cursed. Yes they are. Hey butt sniffing George. Thanks to the $50 butt sniffing

328
01:06:07,739 --> 01:06:14,699
George. It's 5,000 bits for Mr. Butt Sniffing Gorge. It's my 21st birthday today. Could you

329
01:06:14,699 --> 01:06:19,820
please get me in contact with Bugleberry so I can ask him to wish. So I can ask him to wish

330
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:52,139
a happy birthday to George. There he was. He just ran in here. All right do I want to continue

331
01:06:52,139 --> 01:06:58,519
playing this or I want to put in like elements or like raving rabbits. You gotta give these games

332
01:06:58,519 --> 01:07:14,260
a chance. You can't just fucking. We're going raving rabbits. All right I'm pulling the plug.

333
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:29,559
I'm selling it. All right I'll pull the plug on it. It's fun. It's fun. I like it. I don't hate it

334
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:34,630
but it's a little too slow. I thought we were going to be able to make a robot. It's a little

335
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:40,099
too slow. It's going to take us probably six hours to get to the point where it's like the

336
01:07:40,099 --> 01:07:44,420
things that I want to do. We're going to pivot. We're going to play raving rabbits because that's

337
01:07:44,420 --> 01:07:59,369
going to be a pog experience. Give me one sec. I don't even own it. I don't even own that game.

338
01:08:00,170 --> 01:08:12,199
Don't own raving rabbits. Fuck. No no I just I just I just I just own the raving rabbits fucking

339
01:08:12,199 --> 01:08:59,319
ultimate party collection which is every single video game they made. Come on. What. That's not

340
01:08:59,319 --> 01:09:08,149
even. That's not even remotely accurate. This is for a different system. It doesn't even fit in the

341
01:09:08,229 --> 01:09:16,680
same tray. Why did you fuck this up? How did you fuck that up? How did you fuck this up?

342
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:19,960
It's impossible. It's not even the same size of the right fucking tray.

343
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:50,229
Big game hunter 2005. Oh fucking god damn it. Put it in. Let's I want to see what I want to see

344
01:09:50,229 --> 01:10:21,130

345
01:10:22,149 --> 01:10:26,630
Un-fucking-believable. I can't even believe it. That's like that's impossible to make that mistake.

346
01:10:32,439 --> 01:10:42,939
2004. Oh my god. It wasn't a mistake. It was deliberate. They deliberately put that fucking

347
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:50,390
game in there. Like what I'm not going to know. It's not even close. I can understand. Okay maybe

348
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:56,710
if it was like if that was loud if it was like raving rabbits the first one or something right

349
01:10:56,710 --> 01:11:02,069
or like raving rabbits two you think okay like you fucked up it's a game cube game for a fucking

350
01:11:02,949 --> 01:11:10,699
big game hunter 2005 oh this i don't even want i'm gonna play this game for fucking 10 minutes

355
01:12:16,359 --> 01:12:30,819
i don't i don't understand strength this makes sense and this should it should be one stat in

356
01:12:30,819 --> 01:12:43,880
this game it should be accuracy and stealth resilience what resilience for what how many

357
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:56,220
like cans of soup you're gonna eat while you wait for the deer i don't understand this all right

365
01:15:40,979 --> 01:15:51,130
career when i when i was a young boy my dad pete took me along as he embarked on a great quest

366
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:58,729
that he had dreamed of all his life to qualify for the hunter's hall of fame and hang their plaque

367
01:15:58,729 --> 01:16:07,909
on his wall it is an admirable accomplishment that you have completed crossing all the land types of

368
01:16:07,909 --> 01:16:14,310
this great country braving a range of weather taking one for each animal waking one of each

369
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:18,869
animal in all regions 65 and always took me through with forests and grasslands mountains and deserts

370
01:16:18,869 --> 01:16:23,189
as he cracked the great trophy animals of north of bertha he came so close to completing his goal

371
01:16:23,189 --> 01:16:26,390
he was just three animals short when he slipped down an icy hill and broke his leg

372
01:16:27,189 --> 01:16:34,520
fortunately we weren't far from the lodge and the warden called a rescue helicopter for us

373
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:39,960
my dad always said we would finish one day and get that plaque but he'd never can you slow down

374
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:44,760
the teleprompter please he did now and i follow his footsteps on the quest for my place in that

375
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:49,720
hunter's hall of fame and a plaque that i will give to my dad in honor of all the memories he gave
