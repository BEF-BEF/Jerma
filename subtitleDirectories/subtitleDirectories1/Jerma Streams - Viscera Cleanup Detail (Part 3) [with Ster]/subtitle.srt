1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:13,769
Hi guys, how are you? Good to see you again. My name is Germo. I'm here to present a stream for

2
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:19,300
you all today. A little late today, but that's because we had a couple of different small

3
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:25,140
issues and by small I mean major issues. Issue number one, earlier about like an hour and a half

4
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,420
ago my internet was off. It was shutting off and turning on, shutting off, turning on. I'm like,

5
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,859
what the heck's going on here? So I had to figure that out. Issue number two, we're going to play

6
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:44,179
when I say we, Star is here. He's muted though. You can't hear him. Star and I were going to play

7
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:48,700
executive assault 2. And wow, that sounds like a fun idea. Let's go ahead and do that. Let's jump

8
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:56,219
into multiplayer and executive assault 1. The CEO game with the first person RTS. The game crashed

9
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,299
every time we tried to do it. We would get into a multiplayer game. We would try to figure it out.

10
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:08,459
Crash, crash, crash. So after it happening a few times, we were just like, uh, let's do something

11
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:14,739
else. And that's something else is viscera cleanup detail. Star has never played it. So we're going

12
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:24,469
to have to teach him how to play it. And here they are now. Oh yeah. We're talking about how

13
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:28,790
we're going to have to teach you how to play viscera cleanup detail. Yeah. He's never played

14
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:33,430
this before. I've never worked a day in my life that my hands are on callus that I've never even

15
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:41,560
held a mop before. I need to teach you how to use a mop. He says that's true though. Have you worked

16
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:53,930
a job? That's not true. I've mopped before for work. Yes. I have. Okay. All right. Okay. I

17
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,370
thought that you were just, I thought you didn't have one of those. I thought, okay, I didn't know

18
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:03,290
you have one. Okay. You just thought I was lying to you. I guess, I guess you had a job before.

19
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:11,210
I guess, I guess you've had to do like nightly detail work before. Yeah. So do I, do you still

20
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,810
need to explain this to me? I can't. Okay. When was the last, I'm curious. When was the last time

21
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:23,780
you held a mop in your hands? Um, it might've been eight years ago. Really? Yeah. I don't know.

22
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:30,550
A long, maybe like six actually. I don't know if that's true. I'm talking, you don't have to do

23
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:35,830
any cleaning, but when was the last time you held a mop in both of your hands? Yeah, like probably

24
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:42,069
six years ago. Okay. For me, for me, it was like two weeks ago. So, okay. I think I have some

25
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:48,150
authority to teach you how to play. And I think I'm, I think I just went to zero. No, thank God.

26
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:55,270
I hear your voice. It's going to be a struggle today. It's going to be a struggle today, guys,

27
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:04,599
but we're going to, I, I'm going for it. It's going to be a struggle. All right. Uh, so more

28
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:08,120
importantly, let's, let's just get in the game because we're already in the game. We already

29
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,909
spent the time getting into the game. I'm trying to touch your face and I can't. Hold on a second

30
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:24,810
here. There is that star. This is me. I'm on this side. You're, you're purple. Yeah. I'm lagging

31
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:33,639
right now. Yeah. I think, uh, my, my graphics up too high. That's what it is. All right. So

32
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:41,219
let's talk. What do you know about, um, cleaning? Uh, you, you dip the mop in the thing

33
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,939
and then you mop the stuff. Okay. Wrong. First of all, you have to clean up your area.

34
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,580
So these boxes here, you come over. I remember he's never played this game.

35
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:56,939
So hold left click. Oh, you don't have to hold it. You just click it. If you want to tilt it around

36
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,900
you hold left click and move it around in a circle. Your mouse, right? You can tilt it around this

37
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:07,259
way. If you press, uh, what button is it that you press to make it so it stands up right?

38
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:12,539
It is not T. Uh, what is it? How do I make it just stand up right? What's the button? Oh yeah,

39
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:23,339
this is the guy teaching me. I don't know what the button is. What's the button? F. No, no,

40
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:30,060
people saying F cause the internet queue. It's not cute. Double click, double art. So what you're

41
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,620
going to do is you're going to double, if you pick something up, you're going to double click

42
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,259
if you want it to stand up right, right click, drop stuff. Everything is physics based by the way.

43
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:45,079
So be aware of that when you're cleaning. So we need to, these are the boxes that you have to put

44
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:53,350
the trash in. And when I say trash, follow me up the stairs. Watch out for that. So in here,

45
00:04:54,149 --> 00:05:00,040
as we open this door, you're going to see, well, this looks pretty clean. This is actually a clean

46
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,720
house. I did not think this is going to be clean. Um, over here on the, okay, nevermind. So over here

47
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:10,439
on the left, you see that there's been a couple of murders. Okay. And we need to pick up the whole,

48
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:18,120
the whole entire house has to be clean before we clock out. I have an idea. You have to listen,

49
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,639
no, you don't get ideas. This is my job. Okay. The rest of the house looks pretty good. So what

50
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:30,839
if we just wallpapered over the rest of this and just that room was back there. You want to just

51
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:35,370
build a wall here. Yeah. But then what happens to the, this part of the house?

52
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:40,730
This just can't go in this part of the house anymore. Oh, we can like clean the front porch

53
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:48,360
because once we sell it, we're good. Yeah. But they're going to want to see the kitchen and

54
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:55,000
shit. How are you going to convince them to do? Yes. You're understanding. So we have to just wait.

55
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:59,180
I wasn't done explaining. So we have to clean up everything. We have to rearrange everything.

56
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:08,230
It has to be spotless. There is an incinerator somewhere. I have no idea where. Okay. Is the

57
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:12,550
meat grinder part of the cleaning or is that the horror? I don't, uh, have I ever seen this before?

58
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:21,779
Okay. I think, I think that works. Oh, I can't pick you up. That's too bad. Hey, there's no

59
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:25,220
incinerator on this level. So we have to put, you have to pick up the things and throw them in there.

60
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:32,699
Okay. What are we putting in that original bucket? Okay. So come over here.

61
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,560
As you can see, this is the slosh romantic. This is a machine. And when you press the button,

62
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,160
it comes out with a fresh bucket of water. Where are you? I'm right behind you.

63
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,680
Grab the bucket of water. Don't spill it. I get made fun of for that. It is very easily spillable.

64
00:06:48,680 --> 00:07:00,220
You're going to take your, I couldn't do it. How did you know? Really? Okay. Well,

65
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:06,069
just be careful with these. You very easily spillable. Very easy. I don't know why it was

66
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:11,509
not spillable. Uh, so you need to take this and obviously bring it. Let's start over here.

67
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:18,259
Get a couple of my own. Yeah. Get your own bucket. Take out your mop. Now your mop can only be used

68
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:22,660
a certain amount of time. So you take a look down here, see how that's doing that. It's cleaning it

69
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,620
up. Your mind is going to get dirty. Watch your footprints. Don't walk through stuff.

70
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:34,170
And once it becomes too dirty, if you keep mopping, you're going to make a fucking mess.

71
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:40,120
Don't do that. Come over to your water and dash it, dash it like that. Clean it up. And then you

72
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:47,160
get to use it a little bit more. By the way, when you get to a point where you've done this a few

73
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:53,560
times, the water is going to get dirty and you're going to have to dispose of that bucket because

74
00:07:53,560 --> 00:08:00,040
you can't use it anymore. Let me just grind this person up. Hold on. This is my first day on the

75
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:09,379
job. Thanks for training me. So you're going to pick that up with your hands and then clean it.

76
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:13,540
No, no, no, no. Well, now you've ruined that bucket. So you've already screwed it up. See how

77
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:18,569
the bucket's ruined now? Okay. So now your head's clean. Let's just put this in here.

78
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:26,250
Okay. So once there's a big mess over here, you start to clean it up.

79
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,529
All right. So do you have a basic understanding of how we're doing this?

80
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,769
Yeah. I'm tracking blood everywhere.

81
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:35,429
Yeah. So you stop doing that job. And by the way, this is happy Halloween, everybody.

82
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:39,590
Happy Halloween. I don't know why we started. We thought we would do something festive for a

83
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:45,450
change. Yeah. Let me just tell you something right now. This map is supposed to take four hours.

84
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:54,740
Oh, estimated. So it's like, is this like a gamer equivalent of doing like a thousand piece puzzle?

85
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:03,129
Yeah. Except you don't have to really think where the pieces go. You just, I mean, I guess.

86
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:09,529
Oh, by the way, get these USB drives. Hold on to them. Why? Because they give you extra points

87
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:15,370
at the end. You put them in the computer. Okay. Okay. So we have to wait. I need a designated

88
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:20,250
area. Think of a desert because we don't want to lose these. So designated area for these are going

89
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:25,259
to be over here. Yeah. Just drop them like right here. If you find a green USB drive.

90
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:29,100
All right. Well, I need a bucket of water. Where's that bucket of water? There it is.

91
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,909
I'm going to bring this upstairs. So do you want to work together or do you want to change rooms?

92
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:42,840
Um, I don't know. This is going to fall. I think we could probably do different rooms.

93
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:49,269
You said you wanted to, uh, said you wanted to embarrass me and show me how much better you

94
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:53,610
were at cleaning. Yeah. I mean, I could, we could do, if you want to pick a room and we could, um,

95
00:09:53,610 --> 00:10:02,299
we just do it in the neighbor's yard. Yeah. Oh, I'm just realizing. So the next people have to

96
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:09,740
clean up the next house. Okay. So come over here. Let's, we have to pick equal rooms.

97
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,899
Let's go upstairs. We have, they have to be equal. Is there an upstairs? How do we get upstairs?

98
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:35,299
Is there an upstairs? It looks like there is. This is a closet. Okay. Is your room clean? I think

99
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:43,460
it's pretty clean. Oops. Oops. Oops. Hey rookie, come in here for a second.

100
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:51,370
Open the door. Open the door. You open the door. I'm doing a joke. You have to open the door. No,

101
00:10:51,370 --> 00:11:01,460
you open the door. Hey rookie. Oh, your bucket. You're fucking this up for me. All right. No,

102
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:06,500
wait, how do you get upstairs? I was going to make like the Hey rookie thing where I hold the glass

103
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,539
and drop it in front of you and it breaks and I walk out of the room. Where's the upstairs?

104
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:28,460
How do we get upstairs? There's a basement. This basement. Why is there no light down here?

105
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:36,139
There's a USB. Yeah, grab it. How do we turn the lights on? Is there no upstairs? How's this

106
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:40,730
thing going to take four hours? This is going to take like 20 minutes. How long have we been

107
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:50,740
down? Oh, oh, candles. This is how we get light. Come over here. All right. Let's, let's go down.

108
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:58,440
We're going to work together. We're going to go. What the fuck was that? Yeah. Grab a candle. We're

109
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,779
going to start in the basement. We don't need to do, we can do that later. While we work together,

110
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:07,460
this is going to take like 40 minutes. Not even. Grab a candle from the vending machine.

111
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:16,710
Where? Out here. Why do we need candles? Because it's dark. It's not that dark. It's very dark.

112
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:34,340
Vend out a candle. What is that? What does it say? Do you need light? Let me help you.

113
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:42,500
Read it out loud. Turning hardwood into soft pulp. Power. Pure diesel. Fueled wood.

114
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:49,059
Rending power. Tired of hauling branches, logs, and tires, and even bodies for miles just to get

115
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:55,220
rid of them? Well, that ends now. What you need is the ultimate tool. Chuck Torrance's diesel

116
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:00,259
deforester. Is this just an advertisement for the thing in the back? All right. We'll

117
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:05,379
vend another candle. That's, hey, that's dirt. That's dirt. That's trash. Get rid of that.

118
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:10,759
I can only do one thing at a time. We're going to bring, hold on. Where's the,

119
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:21,750
it's too dark. Okay. Any trash has to go in here and then this has to be ground up.

120
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:29,080
That's not, why did you put the candle in there? Because it's not dark. I can see very clearly.

121
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:45,610
Turn your gamma up, kid. Do I turn my gamma up? How do I turn up my gamma? All right. I turn the

122
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:51,220
gamma up a little. It looks better. Oh, I can see now. All right. Okay. Now, now we skipped a whole

123
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:56,600
step. Now it'll be 30 minutes. All right. Well, let's, where's the meat grinder? Are these

124
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,389
pumping in the back? Okay. So take this. We don't need a candle anymore. All right. Take the,

125
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:06,919
just follow me down to the basement. We're getting paid to do this.

126
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,440
There's the stairs. All right. No, no, no. Upstairs, upstairs, upstairs, pronto.

127
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:24,679
Making it worse. No, upstairs. Oh, okay. Stairs. There are stairs. All right. So I'm going to,

128
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:32,970
I'll take, there are a couple of rooms up here. Get out of my way. Get out of my face.

129
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:38,710
Holy shit. This is going to take a long time. Oh no.

130
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:57,000
All right. We'll throw him away. We have to go from the edge of the house out.

131
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:08,440
Oh man. This is bad. This is fucking horrible. I found some belongings. All right. We need,

132
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,159
we need to do this right. I need, where's the thing that pushes out the, um,

133
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:17,029
why is this room so perfect? No, it's like fucked up. This one's like fucked up.

134
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:24,460
All right. So come here. Where are you? All right. So we're going to pick rooms. So I,

135
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:31,419
you take this one. Where are you? I'm right here. So you take this room here.

136
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:39,580
This one here with the bed. Okay. Oh my God. Yeah. It's pretty bad. Okay. So you take that one.

137
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:44,139
This one's really bad up here too. I'll take this one. And then let me see. I want to see

138
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:51,019
where to compare. You can look at this one. Oh, this is, oh, this is so, oh yeah.

139
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:57,700
This is pretty bad. Let me just walk around real fast. You didn't even go in the closet either.

140
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:05,419
That's an attic. No, no, you know, you know, you know, I, I don't want you to examine my shit.

141
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:11,590
Come here. You, you, you pick, pick a door and then whatever you get, you get. Come down here.

142
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:15,340
I'm, you know, I picked this one. I'm going to do this one. I don't know. I have no idea

143
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:19,019
what the fuck's behind that. I don't know. So. Okay. I'm going to do this one. You can do that one.

144
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:27,399
Yeah. No, it has to be an actual room. You want to do this one? I don't know what's behind this one.

145
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:32,679
So I'm going to just. Oh, okay. Just fine. We've been spending 10 minutes. I'll pick this room.

146
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:38,100
Just take that room. I'm going to take this one. Uh, maybe let's, you gotta grab buckets and shit.

147
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:51,960
So come here. Okay. What did you put in here? Oh Jesus. All right. You need to have like at

148
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,399
least two or three buckets as a technique. Now where's the thing that Prince fights?

149
00:16:58,179 --> 00:17:03,500
There it is. Okay. On the left side of the house, there's a device. What the fuck am I breaking?

150
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:09,670
All right. So there's a, on the left side of the house, when you come out,

151
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:15,529
where'd you go? Come out of the house and you need to see this. It's important to know.

152
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:26,119
Yeah, I'm coming. Are you coming? What are you doing? Wait, wait, where are you? Wait, wait,

153
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:32,180
hold on. I'm being assaulted. Come out with the back of the front. How many minutes has it been?

154
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:42,150
It's been six. Just go out the front door. You need to see this. I'm coming. All right. So

155
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:49,609
over here, this green stand up display box thing, you click it and it gives you one of these.

156
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:55,609
It's so much easier just to clean a room by putting shit in here first and then taking that out

157
00:17:55,609 --> 00:18:02,569
and putting it outside and disposing of it later. Okay. So what I like to do is I like to grab

158
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:09,369
two or three stack them up on top of each other and bring like two into wherever you're cleaning.

159
00:18:09,369 --> 00:18:19,019
You feel what I'm saying? Okay. Yeah. Oh, by the way, holding down shift is walk. It's your best

160
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:39,609
friend. Okay. So we're going to go clean those two rooms. Yes. I, I, I, yeah, yeah. What was

161
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:49,660
that Flintstones thing? Oh no, no, I know what that is. Stack. Where are the stairs?

162
00:18:50,619 --> 00:19:07,940
Where are the stairs? Are you serious? I don't remember right here. All right. I got that. Now

163
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:16,789
you're going to want some buckets. There's already, there's already been a fucking mess.

164
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:23,589
The buckets count as trash too though. Stack them and get rid of them. I recommend stacking them

165
00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:28,069
one by one into each other and grabbing the bottom bucket. You can also do that when they

166
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:33,940
have liquid in them, but you have to be careful. I'd like to do at least four or five. Do you really

167
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:43,960
like to do this? What are you talking about? I'm talking about like you have some free time.

168
00:19:43,960 --> 00:20:04,309
You just like hanging out and cleaning. Yeah. Yeah. What? Yeah. Stop. You're doing a great job.

169
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:12,460
Just do it. Oh no, I'm good. Oh, by the way, be careful because sometimes it might,

170
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:28,410
you might get a troll. Spill. You get your own. You have your own room to do upstairs. So get

171
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:36,569
your own. No, bring more than one. He's an idiot. He's an idiot. I'm the idiot. He's an idiot. He

172
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:40,950
doesn't understand. You're on like your fourth spill. Oh, I wonder why that is. Maybe it's

173
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:45,109
because somebody keeps taking them and throwing them into the trash behind me. I only need one.

174
00:20:45,910 --> 00:21:06,730
He's an idiot. He doesn't even know. Where is he? I don't like how quiet it is. I can

175
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:13,369
hear him like walking around. Are you starting? I guess. Okay. Just wait. We have to do a three,

176
00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:20,569
two, one countdown. I almost just dropped all this. Okay. Stop. Why is it doing that?

177
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:28,539
Why is it doing that? Guys, why is it doing that? Is this too big to go in the door?

178
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:44,549
The hell? Oh, fuck. Okay. Why are you leaving doors open? That's your issue.

179
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:51,829
There's blood all over every wall. Why are the doors open? You're going to get a draft.

180
00:21:51,829 --> 00:21:55,750
You gave me like a Nickelodeon guts staircase to go up, by the way. Thank you.

181
00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:06,069
Can you move that chair, please? Can you move this stuff for me, please? Oh, my mouth.

182
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:11,430
Not funny. No, time out. Time out. Time out my mouth. Time out. I'm bleeding. I'm moving. I'm

183
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:21,619
moving. I'm good. It was funny until you fuck. I got to go to the hospital, dude. Did you move

184
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:29,079
everything? Yeah. It's just. Oh, my fucking God. Take the one on top, please. Just take the one out

185
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:38,440
of the top. Thanks. Server reaching net actor saturation. Uh oh. What does that mean? We're

186
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:48,779
about to be over saturated. Server reaching over saturated levels. All right. Are you ready

187
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:56,680
to start cleaning? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Let's see whose methods better. Okay. So on the count of

188
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:23,160
on the count of three. Uh, what? Hold on. Let me. I'm not ready to count yet. This is oversaturated.

189
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:36,410
Okay. On the count of get out of here. You've done enough. Okay. Are you counting? I'm not

190
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:40,089
ready to count yet. Hold on. You're cleaning already. I'm not cleaning yet. I promise. Look

191
00:23:40,089 --> 00:23:48,329
at this room. Okay. Ready? No, I'm not giving you another viewer. Okay. One, one, two, start

192
00:23:48,329 --> 00:24:03,779
cleaning. Okay. Got any music? What? No, I have to play that. Yeah. Isn't there a radio in the

193
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:14,630
game? There is a radio in the game, but it's it doesn't really work that well. Oh, are you

194
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:20,150
allowed to listen to music? Uh, maybe. Am I? Does your mommy say you could? Did you take my?

195
00:24:21,109 --> 00:24:45,420
Take your what? Nothing. What the fuck was that? Is that you doing that? Or is that the game

196
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:50,220
doing that? That's the horror mansion doing that. Is that the horror mansion? Yeah.

197
00:24:51,180 --> 00:25:21,779
Fuck. Too many actors. Can you, can you clean up some of these actors, please? I'm doing,

198
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:57,609
I'm doing it. You okay? I'm going to be okay. Dastardly. I'm sorry. Did you not use that word?

199
00:25:57,609 --> 00:26:08,009
I just said dastardly. I'm sorry. Having a fun time. I wish I had the candle in here and it's

200
00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:21,990
too dark. It really is. Are you serious? I just need can. I'd like the candle. How are you doing?

201
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:29,259
You doing okay? Yeah. How are you like halfway? Yeah, I'm getting there. I think maybe I should

202
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:56,119
have got more buckets. I told you I'm trying to get this as clean as possible. Clean, clean, clean.

203
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:03,420
Now remember, it what it matters is to be valid. Your room has to be completely empty

204
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:09,259
of no like trash cans. No, but if this stuff like belongs there, like there's books and stuff.

205
00:27:09,259 --> 00:27:13,579
I mean, the books are fine, but no like trash and no buckets and no enough. Yeah, it has to

206
00:27:13,579 --> 00:27:21,109
be out of the room completely clean room. Okay. And we'll have we'll have some like a chat

207
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:48,329
inspection. I'm not in a game. No. All right. Well, you you try to host this time. Damn it.

208
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:59,369
Hold on. I put in so much work. I did too. You don't know how much work I put in.

209
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:09,480
God damn it. Okay, hold on. I'm setting up the host. Maybe I can actually do it this time.

210
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:17,289
Oh, wait, I'm in like the normal game now. It like kicked me to the normal game. Oh, you got

211
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:24,539
on the normal game. Oh, my God. Do I have your stream restarted? It was playing on my stream.

212
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:30,759
It was wait, what? Forget about just don't even talk to me. All right, I'm gonna go like this.

213
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:39,769
And I'm gonna go like this. And it's gonna be really fun in like another 20 minutes when I go

214
00:28:39,769 --> 00:28:48,700
to zero again. Okay. Well, I'm hosting it. I'm in the game. Wait, frick. Hold on. I'm not hosting it.

215
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:55,980
I closed the game. This is too hard. Cleaning was easy. Cleaning was easy. This is hard.

216
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:05,900
I'm going to zero again, I think. No, why? Why? If you can't clean it, just call it off.

217
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:18,980
No, I can't call it off. Just admit that I win. We can move on. I'm not going to admit.

218
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:23,849
We can reschedule. We can do something else. All right, let's try one more time.

219
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:43,930
Okay. All right, you got a game? Okay, hold on. I'm fuming right now. Oh, I just like I'm fuming

220
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:52,410
right now. Okay, I'm in. I think I invite you. I don't do I don't know. I've never used a computer

221
00:29:52,410 --> 00:30:08,940
before. The mic still on. I know I'm live right now. We'll try it again. We'll see what happens.

222
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:16,759
Oh, yeah. Well, now we both know how this works. You know, it's fair.

223
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:18,440
It's hilarious because you want to know something?

224
00:30:25,099 --> 00:30:32,630
I just got murdered. Why? I was going to say something funny. Not funny, actually. The funny

225
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:41,750
thing is they did a hardware node upgrade. They did like hardware maintenance, like upgraded the

226
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:49,480
node as worse than ever before. Holy shit. What are what are you saying? Holy shit. Like fucking

227
00:30:49,480 --> 00:31:00,500
the Internet's stupid. Okay. Anyways, you got a game? I'm coming. Yeah. Let's see if this works.

228
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:05,210
See if I can stay connected for more than a minute. Oh, did you put the password in the

229
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:17,099
in our in our DM here? It's the same one from the other game. We tried to play another game

230
00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:23,880
before this and my computer like restart it. And then it crashed to desktop the second time.

231
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:31,619
So so far, you know, playing games with Jerma, a lot of fun. It's going pretty good. It is fun,

232
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:45,319
isn't it? God. All right. Hey, okay. So what would you look? Okay, so here's how you play.

233
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:52,819
It's funny. Here's what you do. Go over here. Shut up. And there's you pick it up, you press

234
00:31:52,819 --> 00:31:58,700
you can rotate it. What does this thing do? It tells it's a smell machine. It tells you what

235
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:05,130
when you turn it on, and you point it around. It'll tell you specifically what direction is

236
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:11,450
still trash. You can change the you can change the mode. If you right click one of them is blood

237
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:18,200
and body parts. The other one is trash. And it kind of beeps the closer you get. Okay.

238
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,599
That's great news. Yeah, it is. You are not going to get that same room again, because

239
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:37,660
we both know it was already. Yeah, I know. Yeah, I know. It was it was fun. So how about

240
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:44,740
how about you get the room that I had with the bed? And I'll do the basement. You think you can do

241
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:51,859
that? Yeah. I'll just do you one higher. I'll do the living room. I'll do the whole living room.

242
00:32:51,859 --> 00:32:55,619
This would be completely completely spotless. I think the other room was worse because it's

243
00:32:55,619 --> 00:33:05,450
upstairs and you got to walk all the way up there. Is that not fair? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. You get my

244
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,690
old room. I get basement. You're the one that had like the bed with the blood in the Freddy Krueger

245
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:19,299
hand. Yeah. All right. You got it. Get situated. Get ready. Okay. And I'm not going to like close

246
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:32,579
the game when I'm embarrassed about my room or anything. Okay. And I'm only doing the

247
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:37,380
there's like two rooms down here. I'm only doing the actual basement. Why did that cause more?

248
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:44,470
Not this like no just do the actual basement. I'll do your old room. I'm loading in more stuff.

249
00:33:46,299 --> 00:33:51,109
Okay. I know what room is yours. I'm going to get some stuff situated and we can go

250
00:33:51,190 --> 00:34:06,759
up. Get this back over here. Making a lot of noise up there. Yeah. Cause I'm moving around.

251
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:24,539
I'm trying to get situated so I can start this cleaning job. Okay. Where? What the fuck? Good

252
00:34:24,539 --> 00:34:30,440
call. Nice. Nice call. Not a bad idea. I just ran around. I walked around the whole house

253
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:48,699
to get this. I'm only going to do two. No, I can do three. I know I can do three. I've done like,

254
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:54,780
I've done like five before. I can't even fit two through the front door.

255
00:34:55,900 --> 00:35:15,579
Let's go. I can't do two. No, I can't apparently. Why are you leaving doors closed in this house?

256
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:24,730
We're doing a job. What? Why am I leaving doors closed before it was open? And it was

257
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:32,889
irritating. What am I? What's going on? Am I stuck on something? I was just walking on the table.

258
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:47,349
That makes no sense. Okay. I'm about ready to get going here. This is the room right here.

259
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:52,469
I thought we started. No, that's fine. You can go ahead. No, that's fine. You're that confident.

260
00:35:52,469 --> 00:36:03,320
I'm pretty confident. I am. What the fuck was that? I'm confident. I am. All right. Here we go.

261
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:25,780
Jipple sandwich. Why are you doing that? I don't know. Did you almost get crushed?

262
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:30,179
I don't know. I was just thinking about Jipple sandwiches. We're kind of in a house of horrors.

263
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:50,260
Why am I even doing this? This can just stay in here. Remember, no trace of any liquid.

264
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:56,019
Everything has to be perfect. Not even water? I mean, no, no, no, no, no water. The room has

265
00:36:56,019 --> 00:37:15,989
to be done. Okay. You're something of an expert. How many rooms have you cleaned? Let's get that

266
00:37:15,989 --> 00:37:21,030
straight. Ever? Yeah, because you're about to be beat by like a one-time room cleaner. I mean,

267
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:30,460
I've cleaned a lot of rooms before. It depends. How many? I mean, we all know you haven't picked

268
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:35,019
up a mop in like four years, as you said, five years, something like that. Very respectful.

269
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:49,880
That's not a bad number. All right. I'm getting, I'm doing pretty well. How are you doing over

270
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,280
there? Things looking good? Very good. Very good. Good, good, good, good. I like to hear that.

271
00:37:55,239 --> 00:38:04,940
I like to hear the competition is, you know, not just a one-sided thing, right? Yeah. It's

272
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:11,880
nice to see that the server is like stable now. Yeah. I wonder why it was having problems before.

273
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:20,519
I don't know. I'm just going to make my own internet. Yeah. Maybe I was saying before,

274
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:27,690
maybe you should like move to like Vegas to fix your internet. Everything sucks. Don't you know?

275
00:38:30,489 --> 00:38:42,170
Everything sucks. Oh, we're getting the actor. We're getting the oversaturated actors thing again.

276
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:59,900
Who's an actor? I don't know what that means. Nice spill. Did you hear it? I heard you say

277
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:04,460
fuck and I heard a bucket. I haven't spilled once yet. This game is easy.

278
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:43,639
I need another bucket up here. Do you need any help? No. What? Why? I'm just trying to move

279
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:49,619
some stuff in that house. It sounds like you're having trouble. Like I could bring you a bucket.

280
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:55,929
No, that's good. Do you need a bucket? I could bring you something if you need.

281
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:59,849
No, I'm good. All right. Good. Just trying to help each other out here.

282
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,920
United friendly competition. We just we help each other out.

283
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:13,289
You know, do you need something? I don't need anything. I'm good. God damn it. Let me get out

284
00:40:13,289 --> 00:40:19,610
here. I just need to dispose of these buckets that I have in my hand and then go this way.

285
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:36,170
Cool. I need like two more buckets. I think maybe. Why do I always go this wrong way?

286
00:40:40,949 --> 00:40:43,590
Two buckets will do it and then I've got a little bit more time.

287
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:53,030
Come on. Do two. He's getting ahead of me. Come on. Hurry up.

288
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:59,239
Do you know the speedrun strategy so you can like be hop and everything?

289
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:08,119
I have my own strategy. You do yours. Are you trying to lock those out? Illegal move.

290
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:12,119
Illegal move. Illegal move. How is this illegal? You didn't set any rules. Illegal.

291
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:27,820
Are you still behind me? I needed that bucket too. That's an illegal move.

292
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:34,570
If you win, you're disqualified. I don't see any rules written anywhere.

293
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:38,090
There was a verbal agreement that you were going to be nice today.

294
00:41:41,059 --> 00:41:59,349
Jeremiah, I'll be nice today. How you come? Almost done. Really?

295
00:41:59,989 --> 00:42:13,159
Yeah, it's actually isn't that bad. Fucking illegal move. It was bullshit. It really was.

296
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:20,500
Oh, if I lose, it's because of that one bucket. Yeah, because I needed that. I would be almost

297
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:27,590
done by now. Can we get a ref? Anyone? Anyone want to be the ref here?

298
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:44,019
Anyone see that? I just like rubber banded. Oh, lag. Lag. I was going to win by lag.

299
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:52,380
That was an actual illegal move. Yeah. You don't need to mean it. I don't need to tell you that.

300
00:42:52,380 --> 00:43:36,489
Oh my god. Okay. Watch that. Watch it. Okay. Give yourself a percentage. What percentage

301
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:45,190
you think you are? Like 80. 80. Yeah, I'm probably around 70. I got a way to go, I think.

302
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:56,900
Don't get too confident, though. I hear comebacks are very common in the

303
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:09,989
high level of competition. Yeah, I would say I'm like 65% probably.

304
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,199
Going backwards. I think I may have gone backwards a little.

305
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:47,989
Do you know the background for this house? Like, is this?

306
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:54,840
It's like a Freddy and Jason or something. Something like that.

307
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:59,639
On the classic Indian burial ground. There's some empty graves down here.

308
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:15,110
Cool. I like graves or something. I'm focusing. I'm focusing. I'm focusing.

309
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:51,480
I'm way behind you. So I need to focus. I'm probably at like, I'm getting there.

310
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:20,440
Fuck. I'm done. Done. I said it first. I said it first. I definitely said it first. I said it

311
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:29,909
first. I said it first. No, you didn't. You didn't say it. You did not say shit. I said done and then

312
00:46:29,909 --> 00:46:37,369
you said done. How about we based on whose room is cleaner? I bet you have a spot somewhere like

313
00:46:37,369 --> 00:46:46,579
you left something. No, I'll let it slide. Okay. Let me come see your room. All right. Don't track

314
00:46:46,579 --> 00:47:05,110
shit up here. True. Okay. Hold on. Let me walk outside and clean my boots. Hold on. I'm getting

315
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:36,179
clean. I think I'm clean. Okay. Inspection. Oh, what's that chair? I see a knocked over chair

316
00:47:36,179 --> 00:47:40,019
behind you. I just bumped into it because I was scared that you came in here. It was like this.

317
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:48,179
Jack took a screenshot. No, you startled me. It's not right. No, I'm sorry. If an inspector

318
00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:53,670
walks in a room and goes, the person's going to go, what the fuck, and turn. That's what you did.

319
00:47:53,670 --> 00:48:04,340
Okay. I'll let it pass. That's good. Everything's fine. I have to deduct a point for the chairs.

320
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:08,820
What is this chair? Where is it facing? It's not like a desk. It's just in the middle of the room,

321
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:19,269
a chair. What's wrong with that? You guys just leave chairs around your room? Yeah. Is everyone

322
00:48:19,269 --> 00:48:24,389
okay with there just being random chairs? Where would you put this chair? There's no where to sit.

323
00:48:24,389 --> 00:48:29,110
There's no place for that chair to be. It shouldn't be in here. What if I want somebody

324
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:34,309
to come in and help me? Maybe if you turned them and you at least pretended that this was a desk.

325
00:48:34,309 --> 00:48:38,789
Automatically assuming that there's no small baby in this house, that the mother would have

326
00:48:38,789 --> 00:48:45,260
to sit here and nurse. What are you talking about? You need the chair for that. Yeah,

327
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:50,599
you need to sit in a chair for that. I don't know. I wouldn't put a baby on a chair like that.

328
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:56,869
You need a rocking chair. The mother sits in the chair with the baby in her arms.

329
00:48:56,869 --> 00:49:04,630
What are you talking about? I don't know. Fine. Deduct a point. I'll take that. Okay.

330
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:23,510
You can't open these? No, you can't open those. What the fuck was that noise? That was scary.

331
00:49:24,789 --> 00:49:33,190
I got spooked. Nothing. It's nice and clean. All right. You got a 99. Nice. Thank you. Okay.

332
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:51,699
99. One point off. That's cool. Wait. Wait. I just got a tip. What do you mean a tip? Okay.

333
00:49:53,059 --> 00:49:56,739
If you're the inspector, wait, wait, wait. Hold on a minute here. If you're the inspector,

334
00:49:56,739 --> 00:50:00,659
do you have to call other inspectors to do your job for you? That was you just did.

335
00:50:00,659 --> 00:50:05,059
You just inspect photographs and then you get the final review is from chat we said.

336
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:09,860
So I'm taking their input. I know you don't read yours. I read mine a lot

337
00:50:10,659 --> 00:50:17,539
and I take their input all the time and I'm very nice to them consistently. I would love it if

338
00:50:17,539 --> 00:50:21,380
from yesterday's stream if anybody could pull up some data on how many times my eyes looked over

339
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:25,460
at the left monitor. Now that's chat and it was probably four or five hundred times.

340
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:30,980
Is chats on the right? Chat is on the left actually. Nope. Excuse me. I've seen it. Okay.

341
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:34,820
How would I pick up? How would I pick up the one guy? That person's coming to get you.

342
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:39,780
That was weird. That freaked me out. Never mind. You're bringing an axe. Yeah. Because the person

343
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:47,420
who has the least score has to get their head chopped. This is a horror game. Inspectors first.

344
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:54,780
Okay. Let me clean my feet. Let me rub my feet. Let me. Wow. Entry way is a little bit of a. Nope.

345
00:50:55,579 --> 00:51:03,829
Hey, not judging based on the entry. Wow. Well, first of all, this is not the basement. This is

346
00:51:04,309 --> 00:51:09,190
the. Okay. Whoa. Whoa. I don't know about this.

347
00:51:22,099 --> 00:51:33,800
You idiot. Well, thanks for concentrating. You're next. That's the joke. You're one of them now.

348
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:45,530
I win. Oh, oh, oh, I got me. Well, here's the funny thing. I have a confession to make.

349
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:56,329
Yeah. I won. That's a confession. Confession. I won. All right. I threw everything out the window.

350
00:52:00,389 --> 00:52:06,469
Oh, so you cheated. So did you. So you're disqualified and I. You cheated too.

351
00:52:07,269 --> 00:52:12,780
How did I cheat? Look, come over here. My. Wait, did I cheat though? Or did I just move?

352
00:52:17,829 --> 00:52:24,199
Wait, did that? No, that didn't come out of here. We both cheated. We both were wrong,

353
00:52:24,199 --> 00:52:29,960
but I was. I was very deliberate. But your room is not clean. Who's room is cleaner?

354
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:36,980
I think the precedent first is who cheated. Like if you're caught using, you know, what,

355
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:41,619
what were they using the cork baths or, you know, way back in the day when they're hitting slammers.

356
00:52:41,619 --> 00:52:46,340
You're old enough. You remember, right? So I threw stuff out my window, but cleaned the room.

357
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:54,150
You made the room way worse. Who's room is cleaner? You deflated the football. You lose.

358
00:52:56,389 --> 00:52:59,030
Uh, what about, what about the illegal move where you knocked the shit out of my hands?

359
00:53:00,309 --> 00:53:07,349
That wasn't illegal. How is that? No, my room was cleaner and I could have just like kept that lie

360
00:53:07,349 --> 00:53:10,869
up and you would have just been so disappointed. I can't believe you did this though, but thanks

361
00:53:10,869 --> 00:53:18,440
for putting everything in the right spot for us to clean. All right. We're going to work together.

362
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:25,000
We're still doing this. What do you mean we're still doing this? I would love to see you actually

363
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,500
clean the basement disaster zone now. You're just going to watch. Show me how it's done.

364
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:39,820
You're just going to watch me do this. Well, okay. Let's, let's do it together. Nice catch.

365
00:53:40,539 --> 00:53:53,289
All right. So that's not the basement. Hey rookie, catch this. Oh, no. Open the door.

366
00:53:54,940 --> 00:54:01,619
Open the door, please. My lip, my lip, my mouth, my mouth. Look at my mouth. Is it bad? It's bone.

367
00:54:02,019 --> 00:54:06,579
Oh, fuck. No, no, no, no, no, no. I got, I got it. I got it.

368
00:54:09,219 --> 00:54:25,829
Is it better? Let me see. No, it's bad. You're beeping. All right. Let's go. Okay. Where do you

369
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:29,590
start? I don't know. What's the method? You have to just grind the people. You have to grind them.

370
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:42,710
That's not the method. Um, all right. Where's the back door? There's no back door down here.

371
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:46,739
Oh God. All right. Well, we got to bring them all up the stairs.

372
00:54:46,739 --> 00:54:49,380
Wait, is there, there's a cut. There's a thing you can cut. Where's the cutter?

373
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:57,960
A cutter? Yeah. There's a cutter. There's secret tools. Is that another point deduction? You didn't

374
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:07,719
tell me about the secret tool. No, no, no, no, no. Can I, can we cut? There's this, there are secret

375
00:55:07,719 --> 00:55:14,699
tools, but I don't know if they're in here. I can't believe you did this. This is like so bad.

376
00:55:14,699 --> 00:55:20,539
All right. Just start grabbing people. Just grab people. Okay. People first. People try to get two

377
00:55:20,539 --> 00:55:32,409
people in one of these. What about respecting the dead? Um, says the guy that piled them all up down

378
00:55:32,409 --> 00:55:40,090
here. Now get your own bucket. You said try and get two in here. I got two. We're working together.

379
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:52,389
Are you picking this up or am I picking this up? You should take that. Okay. I'm gone. Here. How

380
00:55:52,389 --> 00:56:03,690
about I pass the bodies up the stairs? Just throw them up the stairs. Where's the grinder?

381
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:11,960
Backyard. This guy doesn't even know where the grinder is. Yeah. Nice clean room you had there.

382
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:20,230
All right. This is not, this is not doing so well. I think they're still alive. Are you sure? Are you

383
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:26,389
sure you killed them? Are you sure you killed these people? I am sure they're dead. We're missing

384
00:56:26,389 --> 00:56:48,599
somebody. That person's gone. Wait, there's more down here. Oh dude, dude, dude. What? Dude, there's

385
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:55,239
another house. There's another house? There's another house. Where? Oh, there's a back path.

386
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:03,179
Four hours, by the way. Oh dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude,

387
00:57:03,179 --> 00:57:09,369
dude. I can't believe it dude. Yeah, there's definitely a back entrance though. I mean,

388
00:57:09,369 --> 00:57:16,969
you go around the back. Yes, they do. Dude, I don't see a back door. I guess there's no back door,

389
00:57:16,969 --> 00:57:26,380
but why? I found the one true ring. The one true ring. To rule them all. The Lord of the Rings.

390
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:34,260
Okay. What about it? Do you like that movie? You've never seen that movie. It's literally, it's.

391
00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:43,420
What? You've never seen Lord of the Rings. Stand still. Drop the body. Look forward.

392
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:55,219
Just pick a direction. Just stop. Just pick a direction. I'm stopped. Don't touch my ring.

393
00:57:55,219 --> 00:58:03,639
Oh, it actually is the ring. All right, we're gonna do a bit of golf impression. Uh, wins the

394
00:58:03,639 --> 00:58:20,739
contest. Okay, uh, go. Go, your turn. Go, go, go. Did you just throw out the ring?

395
00:58:22,099 --> 00:58:27,539
Yeah, that's a, that's a fucking whole series then. Oh, okay. I'll hold the box because you can't.

396
00:58:34,889 --> 00:58:50,679
Spoilers. Spoilers. Spoilers. Just bring them. Still. Spoilers. The Lord of the Rings. Spoilers.

397
00:58:51,559 --> 00:58:58,739
What happens if we destroy this? I have the ring in my hand. What happens? Destroy it. What,

398
00:58:58,739 --> 00:59:02,980
is this how you kill Sauron? Don't you have to drop it off Mountain Dune? Like this probably

399
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:14,019
can't do it. Yes, Mount Dune. Mountain Dune. Dune's a good series. You can't even get it in. Here,

400
00:59:14,099 --> 00:59:28,150
let me show you how it's done. There you go. World still stands. All right, keep, keep it going.

401
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:34,150
Go get the rest of them. I lined up the bodies. I did my part. Hey, where are you going?

402
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:53,539
Get this out of the way. Well, you did bring them in a nice concentrated zone. Yeah. Jesus.

403
00:59:54,260 --> 01:00:02,469
That was horrible. It's really like, it went right in there. How far away were you?

404
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:11,579
Right behind you. It's like a glove. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't throw this one in.

405
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:17,110
Okay. New competition. New competition. Okay. Let's see how far away you can stand and get the

406
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:25,739
body in. Oh God. Um, okay. Did you just get it in? No, I'm right here now. Well, I'm waiting. You

407
01:00:25,739 --> 01:00:36,889
first. Okay. Now I get a throw. We trade off throw. Okay. That was the equivalent of a boxing match.

408
01:00:36,889 --> 01:00:40,250
You just like punched me once in the face and I fell flat down and just took a fall.

409
01:00:40,889 --> 01:00:48,199
Okay. See, I didn't get mine. Now you, now you go again. How about not farthest, but

410
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:52,440
the stairs are the limit. You can't walk in front of the stairs. All right. Stairs are the limit.

411
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:57,909
That sounds good. Is it, is there a way to, um, what is it like a way to put momentum behind it?

412
01:01:00,179 --> 01:01:08,500
I don't know. No, I can't like golf them in there. All right. I'm going to try. Here we go.

413
01:01:12,539 --> 01:01:15,980
It looks so silly. Try to get like full momentum. Okay. Move, move, move.

414
01:01:16,699 --> 01:01:21,989
We show you how it's done. Holy shit. That was close. That was pretty good.

415
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:37,460
Wait, wait. Somebody says you can hold left click, hold left click and shake the mouse.

416
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:54,219
Oh, it's just to rotate them. Uh, I lost mine. What? How did he go backwards?

417
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:06,860
Are you trying to, you didn't even dunk it. Oh, you don't think I can dunk it. Wait, wait, wait,

418
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:30,500
wait, wait. I'm just going to place them in. I lost them. Did you just die? Oh shit. I guess I win.

419
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:46,309
I'm back. I respond. Yes, you can die in visceral cleanup detail. All right. You dunk.

420
01:02:47,510 --> 01:03:02,940
How are you doing that? I'm going to get it. Somewhere in the future. Someone's going to pull

421
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:06,699
up this video and they're going to be like, what the fuck was wrong with people?

422
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:13,699
Why are they stimulating, like throwing each other like dead bodies into a grinder?

423
01:03:14,869 --> 01:03:27,500
What were they doing this for? Come on. It looks like,

424
01:03:28,059 --> 01:03:31,340
oh, it looks like you're doing like a magical spell.

425
01:03:45,579 --> 01:03:51,579
Thank you for just standing by and watching too. Cause like you could stop this.

426
01:03:51,579 --> 01:04:01,239
I could, but will I know if I could stand a little closer? No, you have to get it from here.

427
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:10,440
Whoa. I don't, I, it's hard to see where I'm throwing it. Cause I'm not looking where I'm

428
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:32,340
throwing. You're standing closer. How are you doing that? You're going like, you're doing like

429
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:39,659
swing up, down, up, down. Yeah. Look up. Yeah. Look up. Cause you need to get some height on it.

430
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:47,400
And at the end, when you, when you pull it forward, you got to, you got to right click them.

431
01:04:51,159 --> 01:04:54,440
It's really hard to get height. It is really hard to get the height on it.

432
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Please hurry up and do this. So my fucking great grandkids don't, you got it. You got it.

433
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:08,199
You did it. You actually did it. I was going to say, because I'm like great grandkids don't

434
01:05:08,199 --> 01:05:13,849
think I'm like a fucking psycho. Did you see me? Did you watch me or were you like looking at the

435
01:05:13,849 --> 01:05:19,050
stars? No, I saw it. It was great. I just spun my mouse around in circles and like, oh, like I

436
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:35,800
totally gave up. All right. Let's do it. Let's do it. Alley-oop. Ready? Yeah. All right. Let's look

437
01:05:35,800 --> 01:06:05,420
back to the basement. Four hours, by the way. Go one at a time. You're still doing like the

438
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:10,380
magician trick. All right. I gotta, I gotta like try. I gotta make the job fun somehow.

439
01:06:11,929 --> 01:06:19,510
Well, that was weird. Oh, you, if you do it too fast, you just drop them. All right. And wait,

440
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:30,409
is that all the bodies? What am I doing? Why did you do this? Oh, that was a clean throw.

441
01:06:30,409 --> 01:06:46,789
This is classic star. You know, what's classic star. Where are you? We're not,

442
01:06:47,349 --> 01:06:52,260
we're not working on the basement. I am in the basement. How is this still clean?

443
01:06:53,139 --> 01:07:02,730
We gotta go inside out. Oh my God. Put this guy on a team inside. I don't miss anymore. Look,

444
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:06,809
I get that extra step forward. I don't miss. I don't, I don't know what that's a reference to,

445
01:07:06,809 --> 01:07:13,019
but I may or may not have been funny. I don't know. It's not a reference. I'm doing so good.

446
01:07:13,019 --> 01:07:17,019
I'm not missing my shot. That's not like a, like a CS go like pro didn't say that during a

447
01:07:17,019 --> 01:07:20,619
competition or something. I don't, not that I'm aware of. So you did, you just made, you just said

448
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:33,699
that. Yeah. I got, I'm two in a row. Shouldn't we, shouldn't we be getting all this stuff out first?

449
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:38,539
Just when you get, when you have to just get the, you don't want to, you don't want to track stuff

450
01:07:38,539 --> 01:07:44,440
everywhere. Or like we're going, like we're going to. No, but you're not. Oh my God. Look what you

451
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:53,980
did. Look what you fucking did. Look what you did. Stop throwing it. Look what you did. Um,

452
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:57,500
you don't even talk about my throwing. There's a skeleton in here.

453
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:10,809
All right, let's go. You really did. It's like too much stuff. Hey, hey, hey, do we get rid of the

454
01:08:10,809 --> 01:08:17,829
boxes or we just reshelf? No, we gotta get, no, that's not the strategy. What? This is where they

455
01:08:17,829 --> 01:08:26,520
were. I'm going to get two more buckets and I'm going to go get like, there's one already here.

456
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:37,340
Nice. But this one's dirty. So get rid of it. Whether you like it or not, as long as my internet

457
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:45,659
stays on. I know what it is. You can't reach the top shelf. Is that some kind of joke? Is that,

458
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:55,180
is that, I don't understand. Is that like a, like what do you mean? What do you mean? Like I,

459
01:08:55,819 --> 01:09:01,659
you would rather take the boxes out of here, like all the way up the stairs for each individual box

460
01:09:01,659 --> 01:09:08,539
and admit that you can't reach the top shelf. But you, you can't reach the top shelf. No, I. What?

461
01:09:08,539 --> 01:09:13,579
Like you can't reach the top shelf, right? That's what you're saying. No, I'm saying you can't,

462
01:09:13,579 --> 01:09:20,680
like I can't, but you can't either. I totally can. So if I came over there right now and we both

463
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:26,550
tried to grab the top shelf, you, I wouldn't deal with it. No, put a box up on the top shelf.

464
01:09:27,189 --> 01:09:37,850
I don't think you're putting it down when I'm picking up here. I don't. But I'm, I'm very,

465
01:09:37,930 --> 01:09:40,649
I'm a huge, I'm, they actually call me massive man now.

466
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:50,970
Massive man? Yeah. M.M. for short. That's my new thing. Why are you massive man? I just like,

467
01:09:50,970 --> 01:10:02,630
I just heard like a. Yeah. Well, the outside's going pretty well because I'm doing some work.

468
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:08,539
I'm working on it. Remember where we're going to put the collective? Why is there only, oh yeah,

469
01:10:08,539 --> 01:10:21,930
because my internet turned off. Remember what? Remember to put the USBs outside the door,

470
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:27,000
the front door to the right. That's that way we get our bonus. Yes, there is a bonus.

471
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:33,659
And then there's a nice clean house you can feel, you can feel proud of. Okay. And then you like

472
01:10:33,659 --> 01:10:40,680
take a screenshot. Yes. Put it on Insta. Sure. Wherever you want to put it. Don't matter where.

473
01:10:42,039 --> 01:10:58,119
Look mom clean. Wherever, whatever social media you'd like to put it on. Oh, what the? I broke

474
01:10:58,119 --> 01:11:07,180
it. I can't, I broke the box. Do I have to, do I have to get on the roof? I'm going to check out

475
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:13,239
the roof. I broke it. I can't wait to be on that. What do you mean you broke it? I can't,

476
01:11:13,239 --> 01:11:29,300
the box is stuck. Well, we can delete it. Hey, hey, what are you talking about? What?

477
01:11:31,939 --> 01:11:37,779
I sincerely hope you're not getting into any shenanigans. I know I'm trying to get on the

478
01:11:37,779 --> 01:11:43,060
roof, but I can't. We're cleaning the basement. Why are you trying to get on the roof? I'm outside

479
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:50,420
doing the outside. Cause look, no, every time we agreed to both do the basement. Look, the email

480
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:57,699
that I got clearly stated you two need to work on the project together. And wherever you feel most

481
01:11:57,699 --> 01:12:03,460
comfortable being at this here, when we're at the cleaning job is where you can go. I hear when

482
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:08,739
we're at the cleaning job. No, you said I see, we were both going to do the basement and we were

483
01:12:08,739 --> 01:12:12,659
going to help each other. I did say that, but I'm still going to do that. But I, I'm going to,

484
01:12:12,659 --> 01:12:15,859
I am going to rub a corpse all along the roof if you don't get down here.

485
01:12:21,399 --> 01:12:27,979
That'll go in the email that I write. So do whatever you think is necessary to do in a

486
01:12:27,979 --> 01:12:44,789
professional manner. I'll come help you. Basement. That's where I'm going. Just get, please move out

487
01:12:44,789 --> 01:12:52,649
of the way, please. I'm fine. Grab that top one. Grab the top one and be gentle. Very gentle there.

488
01:12:52,649 --> 01:12:58,460
I don't know how you did that. What did you do? What did you do? Why did you do that? Why did you

489
01:12:58,460 --> 01:13:06,340
do that? How can you possibly say that? You took it out. You, you took it out. You must have done

490
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:17,289
something. You had to have done something. Look at this. What are you doing? Well, I'm not. Oh,

491
01:13:19,739 --> 01:13:25,909
oh, it's because we deleted the ring. These are ring wraiths. I don't know what you're talking

492
01:13:25,909 --> 01:13:31,109
about. You just, there's no, you don't even know anything. Just grab a bucket and meet me downstairs.

493
01:13:31,109 --> 01:13:43,369
You know nothing. You fucked this up so bad down here. It's not, I don't think it's even

494
01:13:43,369 --> 01:13:49,050
possible to do this. How is it not possible? Okay, here's your job. You want to send like a

495
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:57,289
message to HR? Fine. Go just bring buckets down here and go get like, just keep bringing them down.

496
01:13:58,090 --> 01:14:04,279
Okay, I'll bring one down, take something out. Talk about cans of peas, all the random vegetables,

497
01:14:04,279 --> 01:14:17,960
get them into the trash can and then incinerate them. You can reach the top shelf down there.

498
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:33,300
Hold on. Okay, he's in. Uh, didn't put water in this one. There, there were a couple that I

499
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:47,659
brought down from before. Fuck this bucket stacking. It's a waste of everyone's time.

500
01:14:47,659 --> 01:15:02,760
Dirty water. Okay, put those. All right, we're gonna have to take the box, the boxes up like

501
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:07,960
one by one, I think. I'm put, I'm shelving them. You're, you're putting these on the shelves?

502
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:28,010
Yeah. Oh, you're standing on a bucket to do it. Cute. You didn't even clean up here. You didn't

503
01:15:28,010 --> 01:15:32,010
even clean up here though, dude. Like, come on. What do you, what? You can clean after you put

504
01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:36,649
the boxes there. You can put, you can't, you're gonna knock the boxes off. What do you mean?

505
01:15:40,649 --> 01:15:46,890
You're gonna clean under the boxes after the boxes are up there. I'm sure you can. Oh man,

506
01:15:48,979 --> 01:15:51,380
I don't think I can work like this. I don't think I can.

507
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:55,619
Holy fuck, I just jumped over everything. I'm good. That would have been very bad.

508
01:15:56,659 --> 01:16:11,699
All right, can we at least take care of the entryway? Can you bring a candle down here too?

509
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:15,399
Are you, I just heard a spill. That wasn't me.

510
01:16:27,739 --> 01:16:35,159
What? What? You spilled the bucket and it wasn't me. So it's funny to me. What bucket? I heard

511
01:16:35,159 --> 01:16:50,699
like a up here. That was me throwing out old buckets. I thought you were back in the fucking

512
01:16:50,699 --> 01:17:16,890
basement. You made permanent marks on the wall. Permanent. Yeah, these are permanent marks.

513
01:17:16,890 --> 01:17:36,380
Oh, maybe not. Just clean around. Slow. Easy. Bring, bring a candle down here.

514
01:17:36,699 --> 01:17:44,649
Yeah, I know you can. They're right next to you. Okay, I'll do it. Thank you. I just, I want to

515
01:17:44,649 --> 01:17:48,409
be able to, it's atmosphere. We're doing the Halloween map. You don't want to have atmosphere

516
01:17:48,409 --> 01:18:01,720
here. There's a little, there's a little cache. Okay, I got it. I got it. What was that? What was

517
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:06,699
that? Focus on, focus on what's in front of you. What do you mean what's in front of me? Like do

518
01:18:06,699 --> 01:18:10,380
your task. What's that noise? Worrying about everyone else is doing. I'm getting you the candle.

519
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:13,899
All right, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Take this. You're like, what's that? There was a chainsaw

520
01:18:13,899 --> 01:18:17,659
sound. I thought you brought a chainsaw down. Take this. No, that was the creating a candle.

521
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:23,369
Oh, that, right? Like put it on the, yeah, no, no, no, I'm gonna have to clean there.

522
01:18:23,369 --> 01:18:28,119
Take this up with you when you're out. Here, you put it where you want it. Yeah, I will. And then

523
01:18:28,119 --> 01:18:31,079
just take this. This one's dirty. Let's get rid of that one. Throw it in the incinerator.

524
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:51,590
There we go. Thank you. That's, that's so much better. Why are you up here? I just wanted to

525
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:58,579
check. Check what? I just had to check on something. Not a big deal.

526
01:19:02,899 --> 01:19:09,340
I'm gonna have something else for you to take. Why would we get grind these up? These are

527
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:15,899
perfectly good beans. All right, this is starting to do the thing where there's too many physics

528
01:19:15,899 --> 01:19:19,899
objects in the thing at the same time. So you have to take this and get out of here with this.

529
01:19:19,899 --> 01:19:27,859
Let me shake it up. Okay, okay. Drop it, drop, drop it. Hold on. Drop it. Easy.

530
01:19:27,859 --> 01:19:35,689
Easy. Careful. It's going to do the physics thing. I'm, I'm well aware of the physics thing.

531
01:19:39,989 --> 01:19:50,899
See, don't you, don't you think this is a cool game? Hello. It's great. It's great. It's great.

532
01:19:52,739 --> 01:19:57,350
Don't, you don't, don't be sarcastic about it. It's fun. It's great. Just wait till we do another

533
01:19:57,350 --> 01:20:09,590
one after this. Uh, which one's next? I'm already looking forward to it. Well, we bet you better

534
01:20:09,590 --> 01:20:26,970
hurry up. We got work to do here. Oh, nice job. Back on the shelf. Nice job, like hiding the beans.

535
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:32,489
For yourself. What do you mean hiding the what? Put the box in front of the beans so no one knows

536
01:20:32,489 --> 01:20:38,310
there's beans back there. There's a broken plate over here. Do you want another box? Is that what

537
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:43,340
you're saying? Stand over here for a second. Just stand over here. Get like in the light right,

538
01:20:43,340 --> 01:21:01,180
right there. Right there. Oops. Sorry, I dropped it. Don't do it. Why did you, what, what, how did I

539
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:17,659
end up with this in my hand? What? Just, okay. Okay. I didn't do that. That was mean. That was

540
01:21:17,659 --> 01:21:21,100
a mean thing that he did. Are you bringing some new, you're not bringing new buckets down.

541
01:21:23,189 --> 01:21:29,779
These are still clean. The one you just dumped on me was full of blood. And now I have to take out

542
01:21:29,779 --> 01:21:34,020
this box. There's two clean buckets right here. And now I gotta take this box out. Look what

543
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:42,979
you've done over here. And you're tracking mud all over the place. Thank God that candle's down here.

544
01:21:48,090 --> 01:21:54,149
Did I just break the grinder? What? We need that. I heard like a, but that's fine. That's fine.

545
01:21:54,149 --> 01:22:05,340
USB right here. All right. Look, come on. It's looking pretty good. It's not looking bad. Yep.

546
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:11,420
And this is almost one room done. Well, this room was like 10 rooms because you made it that way.

547
01:22:17,109 --> 01:22:25,300
Anything in this? No. The only reason why this room is taking so long is because you put all

548
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:31,060
the trash from all the other rooms into one room. I, all those boxes were in that room already.

549
01:22:31,939 --> 01:22:36,420
What about the 10 bodies? Where'd you get those? I got the bodies from a lot of places.

550
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:53,859
Are you calling those bodies trash? Respect the bodies. Thank you for the new water. No,

551
01:22:53,859 --> 01:22:58,899
come here. Give me this candle. There we go. Now I can see better. And now here we go. Okay.

552
01:23:00,439 --> 01:23:08,579
I consolidated the trash. Like that word. Consolidated. Yeah. I could, what is this?

553
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:20,739
Like a credit card payment? No, this is like almost cleaned up your whole mess.

554
01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:44,090
That was a Jerry Seinfeld level joke. Seinfeld was a hilarious show. That's a very funny show.

555
01:23:44,090 --> 01:23:51,720
So that's okay. That's like a nine out of 9.8 out of 10 on Rotten Tomatoes. Why would I be mad

556
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:58,890
about that? Yeah, it's like one of the best shows of all time. I mean, that's like saying like, oh,

557
01:23:58,890 --> 01:24:03,050
man. Well, what you just did right there. Oh, that was like, that was like something God would do.

558
01:24:04,810 --> 01:24:07,930
He's very comparable. Like, oh, well, yeah, I get it. Okay.

559
01:24:15,829 --> 01:24:21,529
Isn't streaming much better with an audience? What are you talking about? Oh, like when you

560
01:24:21,529 --> 01:24:26,409
hear Ashley laugh. It's like you can imagine you're streaming in front of an auditorium.

561
01:24:28,329 --> 01:24:32,090
Well, there's like one person in this stand. There's one person in this stand.

562
01:24:32,090 --> 01:24:44,390
But at least they showed up. I don't hear any laughs from your side. No, no, that person's not

563
01:24:44,390 --> 01:24:49,189
here in the auditorium. You brought a cell phone in and put it on speakerphone and put it in the

564
01:24:49,189 --> 01:25:01,939
chair. And they're watching the live video of my like stand up routine. Yeah. Critics are saying

565
01:25:01,939 --> 01:25:13,829
as good as Seinfeld. Go get Otto. All right, this is almost full. I feel like I'm doing more than

566
01:25:13,829 --> 01:25:18,630
you. You're not doing more than me. You have a live feed of my work that you can critique

567
01:25:18,630 --> 01:25:24,659
anytime you want. I don't have like the multi stream. Who's watching both? Who's doing more?

568
01:25:24,659 --> 01:25:29,590
Are you streaming? Yeah. I thought you had, I thought your stream was off. Why are we not in

569
01:25:29,590 --> 01:25:44,520
squads? I don't know. I thought you, your stream wasn't on. What? Add me to a squad. Okay. What

570
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:55,130
the hell is going on here? I don't know you streaming. I know. Do you invite me? Hold on.

571
01:25:55,130 --> 01:26:00,550
I'll invite you. No, I'll invite you. Yeah. Fine. Fine. Invite me. Invite me. Okay. Invite me.

572
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:06,710
Invited. All right there. I didn't know that was happening. I thought you had your stream turned

573
01:26:06,710 --> 01:26:15,399
off. No, you weren't live when I turned it on. That never happened. I checked your stream.

574
01:26:17,460 --> 01:26:22,729
We both started at the same time. Yeah. But did you turn your stream off after you played

575
01:26:22,729 --> 01:26:33,909
Overwatch? Yeah. As I'm saying, all right. All right. You ready? I've got, I've got most

576
01:26:33,909 --> 01:26:39,739
of the trash. Wow. You did a good job. You did. How satisfied do you feel? I'm not that satisfied

577
01:26:39,739 --> 01:26:44,699
yet because there's still things that need to be done. Can't you just take a moment and like be

578
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:52,460
happy? We can after we get it all done. I've actually never seen you smile. You look at the

579
01:26:52,460 --> 01:27:01,130
ceiling. We're not done. Do you need another bucket? I don't think I need another bucket.

580
01:27:01,130 --> 01:27:15,000
Thank you for the consideration. How long has it been? Four hours? I think we're at like seven.

581
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:29,739
Okay. It's up. The basement is pretty much done. There's a little bit left on the floor,

582
01:27:29,739 --> 01:27:34,939
on the wall a little bit. Oops. All right. He'll pick that up. What's up with this broom?

583
01:27:35,739 --> 01:27:47,100
What's with the broom? Yo. What are you talking about? I found like a broom that I used like a

584
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:52,439
mop, but it's a broom. Oh, I don't know. I figure what that does. All right. I'm going to use the

585
01:27:52,439 --> 01:27:59,640
candle. We're going to check. All right. Everything looks okay except for that. That's why I need the

586
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:05,420
light down here. Well, don't you have like the speedometer to check where the blood is? Yeah,

587
01:28:05,420 --> 01:28:19,850
but I mean it's easier to just see it. Yeah. Don't you have this speedometer saved? Yeah,

588
01:28:19,850 --> 01:28:25,340
that was a little that was just a little a little boop. We're fine. I don't mind the little the

589
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:37,479
little boobs. It's the your internet turns off to zero is the one I don't like. Okay.

590
01:28:38,939 --> 01:28:42,859
We can you can use the little oh no no no no no this the the the red rum room.

591
01:28:44,220 --> 01:28:48,539
There's a bathroom in here. There is a bathroom. Oh god. What did you do in here?

592
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:53,420
I was like that when I found it. It's actually not hard to clean, but unfortunately

593
01:28:54,460 --> 01:29:02,619
I'm sorry to say we need another bucket down here. I'm sure you do. I'm going to bring one up.

594
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:07,579
I'll go get it. You just you keep doing anything. I'm bringing the bucket. Stay in the fucking

595
01:29:07,579 --> 01:29:11,020
basement. Well, okay. I'm going to stay in the basement, but just don't there's a lot of blood

596
01:29:11,020 --> 01:29:16,859
to track. So don't track it up here. I have two buckets that are full of gross stuff that I need

597
01:29:16,859 --> 01:29:37,079
you to take. Clean your feet. Clean feet. Clean feet. I don't have. Yeah, there's an intestine

598
01:29:37,079 --> 01:29:47,720
over here. Hold on. Okay. Take that. Is that yours? Yeah, it's mine. That's my intestine.

599
01:29:53,850 --> 01:29:56,100
Ah, god damn it.

600
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:14,649
Did you spill? Do you still have the one of me complaining? I don't. People asked for it all day

601
01:30:14,649 --> 01:30:18,170
and I forgot. You're gonna have to give me a new one and I'll have to remember.

602
01:30:19,770 --> 01:30:23,449
Hey, hold on. I'll just bring it. I'll bring the second ear over here.

603
01:30:27,189 --> 01:30:35,609
Watch those feet. I'm not moving. You're tracking stuff everywhere. I don't want to read that.

604
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:46,069
Hey, give me one. Give you what? You're gonna give me a line. When did I say I was gonna give

605
01:30:46,069 --> 01:30:50,390
you a line? I thought you just said, okay, never mind. I'm crazy. Never mind. I said what happened

606
01:30:50,390 --> 01:30:55,829
to the one you recorded? Yeah, I said I like didn't save it by accident and then you said,

607
01:30:55,829 --> 01:31:06,869
hold on. I'll give you one and then. Did I do that? Yeah, then. I don't think I did that.

608
01:31:08,859 --> 01:31:16,779
Did I say that? All right, well, turn it on. Okay. No, let's talk about the. Yeah, I've talked about

609
01:31:16,779 --> 01:31:30,390
the ear. Yeah, I wasn't. I didn't say that. All right. You ready? Yeah. Hold on. Oh, yeah,

610
01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:38,380
I was complaining about DPS, right? Okay. Hello. I can hear myself. Why can I hear myself? Hello.

611
01:31:41,909 --> 01:31:52,760
Hello. Hello. God damn it. Why does it have to quit me out too?

612
01:31:53,159 --> 01:32:05,399
Ah, that was a Charlie Brown yell. I know. Hello. Stop it. Stop it. It's not funny. I'm upset.

613
01:32:08,489 --> 01:32:22,300
Stop it. It's not funny. I'm upset. Hello. What the fuck? We're never gonna be able to do a full

614
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:27,579
one of these. Hold on. Oh, yeah, I was complaining about DPS, right? Okay.

615
01:32:33,369 --> 01:32:40,729
No. Hello. No. Why? Why? We can't get anything going. Hello.

616
01:32:47,340 --> 01:32:56,300
What a sad day. Are you coming back? I mean, like the server's still up. What? It is? Yeah. Oh,

617
01:32:56,300 --> 01:33:04,100
it is. Holy shit. Okay, cool. I'm coming in. How did you? You didn't get that? I thought that we

618
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:10,550
like I thought everything got disconnected. No, I'm fine. Because I'm hosting this one.

619
01:33:12,489 --> 01:33:22,310
Oh, cool. Hello. I'm so fucking sad right now. Like, I might sound like, oh,

620
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:28,939
I'm so angry right now. This isn't it. You can't, you know, there's no consoling me.

621
01:33:29,659 --> 01:33:38,600
Hello. Fucking angry right now. I'm so angry. I'm so angry. Hello. All right. So where were we?

622
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:43,479
Uh, we were cleaning the basement. Okay, we're cleaning the basement. Cool.

623
01:33:43,479 --> 01:33:50,760
All right. So where were we? Hello. Stop. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. I can't.

624
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:57,399
I have too many emotions right now. I'm being stretched. I'm being stretched in two different

625
01:33:57,399 --> 01:34:03,000
directions. We're almost done with the basement. You're gonna pull me in half. I have like anger

626
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:16,300
and upset and fucking rage. And then you're making me laugh. Hello. Are you in? I'm in. I'm in. I'm

01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:21,829

628
01:34:21,829 --> 01:34:35,930
basement door. That's how fucked up I am. Okay. The basement is clean. I think basements clean.

01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:47,220
Yeah. Did I drop again? Uh, no, I, I know. All right. The bathroom is clean. The toilet is clean.

630
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:56,409
Oh, I broke the toilet, but it's okay. Oh, typical fucked up. I am. No, I know. It's fine.

631
01:34:56,409 --> 01:35:01,880
I can close it clean, clean, clean, clean. All right. This is clean. That's clean. That's clean

632
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:16,119
over here. Clean this way. Oh, don't do it again. Don't do it again. It's going to do it again.

633
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:21,239
No, it's not. You're fine. Your streams up. Everyone's loving it. Everyone's loving this

634
01:35:21,239 --> 01:35:23,960
content that you're providing. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. You really make me feel better. All right.

635
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:31,189
Let's go. Basement is clean. I'm so happy that you brought me along as backup streamer.

636
01:35:37,850 --> 01:35:42,649
You're like the, you're like the never turn off the battery thing. Yeah. Whatever it is,

637
01:35:42,649 --> 01:35:44,890
the thing you plug in to make sure your power doesn't turn off.

638
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:50,039
I'm the backup generator. Yes. What did I, what did I call it?

639
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,039
I'm the battery thing. I think you called it. The never turn off.

640
01:35:54,439 --> 01:35:56,680
Whatever. The never turn off battery thing.

641
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:06,550
Okay. So I need, what's going on over here? Are you throwing more stuff out the window?

642
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:11,029
What? No, I'm, I'm finishing up the basement. There's a couple like empty bucks down here.

643
01:36:11,029 --> 01:36:22,890
Okay. So this is, what's in here? This one can be done quickly. Yeah. I remember this was me.

644
01:36:22,890 --> 01:36:31,979
Yeah. I'm going to clean up over here. Hello. Hello. Just get like 10 of them. You ready?

Yeah. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.

Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.

648
01:37:05,819 --> 01:37:16,869
Uh, that was just a Charlie Brown's yell. I know. That's a nice car. Can you stop goofing

649
01:37:16,869 --> 01:37:23,619
around with your soundboard? Get this building clean. Oh, I'm doing the, uh, the garage. Hello.

650
01:37:28,699 --> 01:37:37,579
Hello. It's going to be easier to demolish this building. Yeah. It would be way easier just to

651
01:37:38,220 --> 01:38:02,010
do like a controlled demolition. What happened tonight? Did you see the car?

652
01:38:03,689 --> 01:38:10,899
What car? There's a really cool car in here. Yeah. I saw it. I took a body from that room.

653
01:38:11,539 --> 01:38:18,300
You left a body in that room too though. Oh, well see I was having a hard time running around

654
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:21,739
and grabbing bodies and also making sure you didn't see me grab all them.

655
01:38:23,819 --> 01:38:29,880
But little did I know you never left the room. No, I did not walk out of the room. I didn't really

656
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:38,359
hear you walking around. I was wondering what was going on. Scheme. I had a scheme going.

657
01:38:39,369 --> 01:39:00,979
How fucked up I am. That was so angry. I am so bad right now. Scheme. I think we're done.

658
01:39:00,979 --> 01:39:10,300
We are not done. Do you know how much is left in here? I think we're done. We are not done. Pull

659
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:18,699
out your little ecto gun thing and see where it is. It says all clear on it. Oh, hold on. I'm

660
01:39:18,699 --> 01:39:24,170
getting a phone call. Hello. Hello. This is the boss man. They're calling it in. We're done.

661
01:39:24,970 --> 01:39:35,479
What the hell was that? Yeah, all clear here. That was my phone. Our walkie. This is the boss.

662
01:39:35,479 --> 01:39:42,100
All janitors have them. This is not done though. You got your soundboard.

663
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:54,680
I don't even feel wallpapered that room. Why is there on the camera? We could use that somewhere.

664
01:39:58,220 --> 01:40:03,340
All right, the car looks pretty good. Johnny, we've left money in the pantry for you. Remember

665
01:40:03,340 --> 01:40:08,300
to call us straight away if Jason or Danielle try to reach us in case something goes wrong

666
01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:19,850
at the Crystal Lake summer camp. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Let's get this trash out of

667
01:40:19,850 --> 01:40:28,489
here. Hello. You can use that. You can use that somewhere. I think you can use that somewhere.

668
01:40:29,369 --> 01:40:44,569
Hello. Testing my mic. Well, don't worry. You'll disconnect again and I'll have plenty of use for

669
01:40:44,569 --> 01:40:49,369
the hello. Yeah, you'll have plenty of use when I disconnect a fourth time today.

670
01:40:55,699 --> 01:41:02,739
How about you stream when it's working? Like during the day? That is the theory. It is during

671
01:41:02,739 --> 01:41:19,659
the day. Oh. Hello. Garage is almost clean. There are a couple of knives. I cleaned the front yard.

672
01:41:19,659 --> 01:41:28,439
Front yard is clear. This is not trash. They're just knives. That's not garbage. It's a knife.

673
01:41:31,979 --> 01:41:38,039
Here's the question. If we do such a good job of cleaning,

674
01:41:38,039 --> 01:41:41,000
does that mean the parents never know what happened to their kids?

675
01:41:47,029 --> 01:41:56,569
Well, no, because when they know what how would. Well, I just read that note that was telling them,

676
01:41:56,810 --> 01:42:02,409
good luck at summer camp and blah, blah, blah. So if everything is spick and span and perfect

677
01:42:02,409 --> 01:42:11,619
when they come back, how do they know what happened? So shouldn't we leave one blood

678
01:42:11,619 --> 01:42:20,600
stain with a murder weapon? I mean, they've already been notified. Are we the bad guys?

679
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:25,579
No, we're just the cleaning crew. How do you know they've been notified?

680
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:30,699
Did Big Boss Man tell you that? I don't know. I'm just assuming that they've been notified.

681
01:42:31,579 --> 01:42:36,380
Don't you ever think like outside what you're currently doing like your job? Do you ever think

682
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:50,340
like, you know, what if it's not all true? You read too many fucking books. You read too many

683
01:42:50,340 --> 01:42:54,899
books. You should just be drinking tap water and eating fucking Cheerios like the rest of us.

684
01:42:55,859 --> 01:43:09,159
Fuck, I broke the glass. Hello. I was on the front door. Hello. Hello. Hello. Let me fight

685
01:43:09,159 --> 01:43:18,119
myself. Hey, what's up, dude? Nothing much. Hello. How are you? Hello. Hi. That's all I have.

686
01:43:19,239 --> 01:43:22,920
I don't want to press the wrong button too. I'm forgetting which is which. I'm fucked up. I am.

687
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:29,720
Oh, I was pretty. So I got some stuff over here if you need it. I got some. I need a bucket over

688
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:37,739
here. Oh, cool. No, that was pretty cool. But not cool because the internet sucks. So just deal with

689
01:43:37,739 --> 01:43:43,819
it. Cool. I'm not going to deal with it because that's fucking bullshit. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

690
01:43:43,819 --> 01:43:54,659
cool. Stop. Not funny. She laughed. The measurement of what's funny is if my wife laughs. So I think

691
01:43:54,659 --> 01:44:05,619
you're wrong. I was trying to have me yell and talk to me. Oh, cool. You don't even you don't

692
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:13,220
get comedy. I've heard people compare this stream to

693
01:44:16,180 --> 01:44:20,659
think I get comedy. And he's pretty close to the man upstairs himself from my hair. Yep.

694
01:44:25,180 --> 01:44:30,949
What do you do with the USBs when you're done? You put them in the wrong way first every time.

695
01:44:30,949 --> 01:44:46,340
You never get it right. First try. Oh, my God. And that to truth. Oh, my God. Is this how you

696
01:44:46,340 --> 01:44:55,880
get on the roof? I know I tried to use that thing earlier. It doesn't go up on them. What's the

697
01:44:55,880 --> 01:45:06,760
point? Dear Mr. And Mrs. Adams, I'm sorry to report that your son Jason has been implicated

698
01:45:06,760 --> 01:45:12,199
in another unusual incident. This is the third time. So there was a look. See, they left a thing.

699
01:45:12,199 --> 01:45:16,520
Where? Where? I want to read it. It's just it says like, it's like, could you please

700
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:21,640
next time respectfully hand it to me? Thank you. It's a game about physics. There is no such thing

701
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:33,590
as handing it to you. There is. No, this is a previous. This has nothing to do with everyone

702
01:45:33,590 --> 01:45:39,109
being dead. No, this is you don't write like a kindly worded letter because he murdered like

703
01:45:39,109 --> 01:45:50,260
eight people. Will you just come back into the room with the big dinner on it? All right. Is

704
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:58,500
this done? Give it a look. This room? Yeah. Bloody here. Chairs on the floor. I'm trying to do it.

705
01:46:00,819 --> 01:46:05,079
You asked. Make sure you make sure you're not tracking like I am. I'm not tracking.

706
01:46:07,420 --> 01:46:15,189
Glass. Respectfully putting the glass here. Actually, we need to put the tableware out.

707
01:46:15,750 --> 01:46:22,659
That needs to be glass. Put it all out. So I can come home, have a nice dinner with no family

708
01:46:22,659 --> 01:46:33,350
remaining. I want every goddamn honey. Calm down. It's your favorite breakfast. Oh, wait, wait, wait.

709
01:46:34,710 --> 01:46:49,289
Please give me them. Why are you stacking chairs like this? Well, you just smashed the plate

710
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:52,090
because I had to have to be glass breaking. What?

711
01:46:57,050 --> 01:47:04,789
I'm trying to set the table and you'll be a dick. How am I? You're breaking things. I'm

712
01:47:06,220 --> 01:47:11,239
Can I ask you how the chair got on the table? Can I just ask you smashed it? And I thought we

713
01:47:11,239 --> 01:47:17,880
were smashing. So I joined you thought we were smashing things you made. We were smashing things.

714
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:25,750
So I joined you. I'm a follower. You know this about me. You and stuff with this chair.

715
01:47:27,270 --> 01:47:38,039
What? Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's right. Somebody gifted you a sub last time.

716
01:47:43,739 --> 01:48:00,489
The table is clean so I can do the table is going to be set. I should just move the chairs out of

717
01:48:00,489 --> 01:48:14,170
the way. This is the oh my this is the grossest thing I found the whole time we've been doing

718
01:48:14,170 --> 01:48:23,289
this. Where are you? This is the grossest thing. Like an old food container. Yeah. It's like green

719
01:48:23,289 --> 01:48:34,539
and red like the pigs that we're cleaning up after. Okay. Table looks like I'm setting it.

720
01:48:35,180 --> 01:48:42,149
I have to be completely honest. Yeah. I don't know why I'm doing this. Like why are we still

721
01:48:42,149 --> 01:48:50,569
doing this? Because this is the game. So all right. It's kind of a bad job setting the table.

722
01:48:54,329 --> 01:48:58,970
Three people eat on plates over here and then only people only get to have drinks over this way.

723
01:48:59,609 --> 01:49:12,899
You're gonna put the push the chairs in like what the I bet you you won't break a plate. Oh,

724
01:49:12,899 --> 01:49:19,479
and the head of the table. The head of the table gets the light in their face. That's no that's

725
01:49:19,479 --> 01:49:24,279
just so they can inspect the food. No, that's so like you know that they're the one hosting the

726
01:49:24,359 --> 01:49:30,869
dinner. Like a spotlight. Me, me, me. Hello.

727
01:49:37,899 --> 01:49:50,939
Dude, I'm getting achievements like crazy. All right. So we have let's take a little bit

728
01:49:50,939 --> 01:49:58,329
of an indent area here. Okay. I thought this was blood. This car was designed in MS paint.

729
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:14,409
All right. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Right. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool.

730
01:50:14,409 --> 01:50:18,649
Right. Hello. Well, here comes. Yeah. Hello. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool.

731
01:50:20,619 --> 01:50:23,819
Is that because you want it to happen? I just was waiting for it to happen.

732
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:29,239
Do it. It's not funny. You do it. That's the thing. You've done it every time. Do it.

733
01:50:29,239 --> 01:50:35,050
You're you're making me very uncomfortable. Do it. You do it every time. Do it. I'm just trying to

734
01:50:35,050 --> 01:50:49,100
clean up. I don't think I can keep working under these conditions. Can I go home? One time he

735
01:50:49,100 --> 01:51:08,890
doesn't use his like a fucking electro board to make like I don't feel well. We're almost done.

736
01:51:14,939 --> 01:51:21,180
Are you going to check out that new game? Which new game? I don't know any of them. I've played

737
01:51:21,180 --> 01:51:25,350
quite a few new games. Which one? I don't know. Do you have any new games you're going to check out?

738
01:51:26,310 --> 01:51:36,359
Unreleased new games? No, not right now. Nothing new is coming out. There's a few things coming

739
01:51:36,359 --> 01:51:43,880
out. There's always things coming out like every day. Um, I think super sexy made two is out on

740
01:51:43,880 --> 01:52:04,250
steam for a few days already. What? What? The sequel. You're just trying to get yourself,

741
01:52:04,250 --> 01:52:08,329
you know, ashes of remnant. Are you trying to like get your channel banned? No, that's a banned

742
01:52:08,329 --> 01:52:16,170
video games. That's not streamable on Twitch. That's a banned stream game, isn't it? I don't

743
01:52:16,170 --> 01:52:27,159
know. Don't they have like a banned no stream games? Probably. Nice. You did it. I didn't.

744
01:52:30,729 --> 01:52:35,130
I didn't do that. You did it. I did it. You did it. I'm telling mommy. I'm telling mommy.

745
01:52:43,430 --> 01:52:46,550
Get them all away. Wait a minute. We're doing this so stupidly. Put this in here.

746
01:52:46,550 --> 01:53:03,880
You did it. You did it. Where's dad's flood light? I need it. I'm getting dad's floodlight for you.

747
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:09,239
I know you are vision impaired. I don't need it. I don't need it. I don't need it. I thought you

748
01:53:09,239 --> 01:53:31,539
need it like a solar eclipse to be able to see anything. I don't need it. Okay. Clean.

749
01:53:32,789 --> 01:53:50,539
Except for me. And there is a stick in here. Am I a vampire? Holy fuck. There's so many of these

750
01:53:50,539 --> 01:53:56,010
here that I did not put here. That just surprised me how many you've put there. I thought it was

751
01:53:56,010 --> 01:54:05,750
broken. How many of what? How many USB sticks? Oh no. I've been doing my job. Oh dude frying pan.

752
01:54:15,220 --> 01:54:21,029
No, no. There was nothing wrong with that. Why'd you do that? I want a new one. Use this one.

753
01:54:23,220 --> 01:54:36,250
Hold on. This one's good. Thank you. Now finish up. We're almost done with the house.

754
01:54:36,329 --> 01:55:08,260
The house is almost completely good. Oh dude. Why did that? Why did that happen? Yeah. I wanted

755
01:55:08,260 --> 01:55:12,819
to pick up the fucking torso that was buried at the bottom of the barrel. I didn't want to pick up

756
01:55:12,819 --> 01:55:27,590
the barrel. I wanted to pick up the torso at the bottom. What is this? Make sure you hold shift

757
01:55:27,590 --> 01:55:39,739
when you're walking too. To walk. I wouldn't want to drop anything. I wouldn't want to drop anything.

758
01:55:40,140 --> 01:55:50,100
All the gold on the table. Gold on the table. You left some gold on the table. That's your joke.

759
01:55:50,739 --> 01:55:58,060
That's not mine. If you want to make that, you mute me. Mute you and do that on your stream. Hello.

760
01:56:02,579 --> 01:56:16,569
Oh cool. There it is. There it is. There it is. I watch any good TV lately. I thought that was a

761
01:56:16,569 --> 01:56:23,689
soundboard thing. It was weird. Watch any good TV lately. It really was. It was like

762
01:56:24,569 --> 01:56:32,899
abrupt and weird. Have I watched any good TV lately? What's the last TV that I watched?

763
01:56:37,079 --> 01:56:39,159
I don't know. What's the last TV show that I actually watched?

764
01:56:41,939 --> 01:56:46,170
I'm asking you. You should have that information. I don't know. I really don't know.

765
01:56:46,329 --> 01:56:52,729
I don't know. Spider-Man? That's a movie. That's a movie. I'm not counting movies here.

766
01:56:54,420 --> 01:57:07,189
I haven't really watched any TV. Outside is good. All right. We'll have to go through a little bit

767
01:57:07,189 --> 01:57:13,159
and check out on it. What about the garage? The garage was good. Is it completely good?

768
01:57:13,880 --> 01:57:18,439
I didn't detect any. It's the MS Paint car that I wish we could trash.

769
01:57:19,399 --> 01:57:28,979
It looks like blood. No, that's Sting's car from WCW. Was his car MS Paint airbrushed and drawn on?

770
01:57:31,609 --> 01:57:38,649
No. The car is awful. What is wrong with that car? What's the problem with that car? It's

771
01:57:38,649 --> 01:57:45,289
really ugly, but it's not that big of a deal. It's ruining my immersion. We've got to get a

772
01:57:45,449 --> 01:58:00,420
trash container here. Okay. I'm on it, boss. Let me get the gross light to see the fluorescent

773
01:58:00,420 --> 01:58:09,819
light bulb so we can look at the ground and be like, oh, gross. The blue light behind you.

774
01:58:09,819 --> 01:58:21,239
Where do you want this? In the living room. This is what happens when your landlord comes in and

775
01:58:21,239 --> 01:58:27,319
is looking for piss. That's what he's looking for. What happened over here?

776
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:47,420
What? I'm just dealing with... Oh, there it is. Piss. Don't track. I don't track ever.

777
01:58:47,420 --> 01:58:52,680
All right. Let's do this together. Why not? Two hands are better than one.

778
01:58:52,680 --> 01:58:59,579
I've already put in like eight. Four hands are better than two, right? Thank you.

779
01:58:59,579 --> 01:59:13,670
Let me get that for you. Put it down. All right,

780
01:59:13,670 --> 01:59:35,529
to the first person I can chug one of these wins. Cool. I did it. Didn't you?

781
01:59:36,649 --> 01:59:45,930
I love how much you fucking hated what I just did. No. You hated it. I respect the roleplay.

782
01:59:49,739 --> 01:59:53,479
Here's a question. Stale joke.

783
01:59:56,119 --> 02:00:02,260
What's your question? What's the worst character you can think of from TV or movie?

784
02:00:03,140 --> 02:00:08,659
What would be your ideal worst character? Are we talking like things they did in the show

785
02:00:08,659 --> 02:00:13,619
that were bad or... Like their personality, just like how bad of a... You don't care about,

786
02:00:13,619 --> 02:00:24,810
they're just awful. You know, the worst character. I don't know. I can't think of

787
02:00:25,529 --> 02:00:39,350
the character that I just hated. What do you got? I got nothing.

788
02:00:39,350 --> 02:00:44,970
I was talking about it the other night with my significant other.

789
02:00:46,170 --> 02:00:48,250
The worst character from any TV show that I've ever seen.

790
02:00:53,260 --> 02:00:57,720
She hates the lawyer from Jessica Jones. Specific.

791
02:00:57,720 --> 02:01:02,840
It's very specific. She said it was the worst character, so I was trying to come up with worse

792
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:07,720
ones. I forget what I came up with already. It was just last night and I have no intentions.

793
02:01:13,590 --> 02:01:17,590
People saying Garfield. Garfield was a comic book before he was like a TV show,

794
02:01:17,590 --> 02:01:22,789
and the TV show was good. Garfield and Friends. That was not a bad show.

795
02:01:23,989 --> 02:01:29,029
You're smashing blood. What? You just destroyed that doorway.

796
02:01:36,229 --> 02:01:40,630
From the 100. That's a good one. That's good. I don't know. I don't watch that much TV.

797
02:01:41,590 --> 02:01:45,829
I don't have a base on anything.

798
02:02:01,020 --> 02:02:03,979
The mood is very live. And all you have to say is...

799
02:02:03,979 --> 02:02:06,979
Oh, I'm cool. That went the wrong way.

800
02:02:10,180 --> 02:02:14,739
Come on. Come on, dude. Why can't I play that back to you?

801
02:02:14,739 --> 02:02:19,380
Come on, dude. Come on. Because you don't have the thing.

802
02:02:20,180 --> 02:02:22,420
You'd be more than welcome to do it if you had the thing.

803
02:02:23,220 --> 02:02:33,100
What about the pumpkins out here? We should probably set those up.

804
02:02:33,100 --> 02:02:38,409
Hello? I need one of these.

805
02:02:39,289 --> 02:02:41,750
There's still lots of buckets out here that need to be disposed of.

806
02:02:44,789 --> 02:02:45,670
Delete yourself.

807
02:02:52,199 --> 02:02:55,319
At least it's good to know I have a future in being a janitor.

808
02:03:03,720 --> 02:03:06,439
I'm stuck on this. What character is the worst character in any TV show?

809
02:03:08,760 --> 02:03:15,420
Who the fuck is it? Name me a TV show that I've watched, that you know I've watched.

810
02:03:16,460 --> 02:03:22,970
The only show that I know you've watched is Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones.

811
02:03:22,970 --> 02:03:33,939
Oh. Ross from Friends.

812
02:03:36,149 --> 02:03:37,829
What? I've never seen that.

813
02:03:37,829 --> 02:03:40,069
I don't... Why? I thought people liked him.

814
02:03:48,140 --> 02:03:53,699
Peggy from King of the Hill. That's disrespectful.

815
02:03:53,699 --> 02:04:03,060
She is a loving, caring, family woman. She goes to great lengths to provide when Hank can't.

816
02:04:04,810 --> 02:04:09,289
She makes a miraculous recovery from falling out of a fucking airplane.

817
02:04:13,380 --> 02:04:14,739
And she's not good enough for you.

818
02:04:28,060 --> 02:04:30,779
I mean, I like Peggy Hill.

819
02:04:33,369 --> 02:04:38,220
How about The Vision? I hate The Vision.

820
02:04:39,510 --> 02:04:45,800
Open this door. Open this door! What are you doing out there?

821
02:04:46,520 --> 02:04:47,560
I'm fucking cleaning.

822
02:04:51,560 --> 02:04:53,000
Who's closing doors?

823
02:04:59,829 --> 02:05:01,029
What did you do with the USBs?

824
02:05:02,100 --> 02:05:03,300
What USBs?

825
02:05:03,300 --> 02:05:06,579
The USB drives I've been collecting. This whole time.

826
02:05:07,699 --> 02:05:10,420
You were just out... Do you think I'm capable, like,

827
02:05:10,420 --> 02:05:14,420
number one, physically, or number two, mentally, being able to move all those in less than 30 seconds?

828
02:05:16,220 --> 02:05:17,819
Yes. You really think that?

829
02:05:29,579 --> 02:05:30,939
Typically, you would be the one to be like,

830
02:05:30,939 --> 02:05:33,819
no, you could never do that in that amount of time. You're just so slow.

831
02:05:36,069 --> 02:05:38,390
You're very athletic when you want to be. You did a...

832
02:05:39,989 --> 02:05:41,430
What's it called from the top rope?

833
02:05:43,399 --> 02:05:45,159
What? A whirlwind or something?

834
02:05:45,159 --> 02:05:46,680
A whirlwind?

835
02:05:46,680 --> 02:05:50,180
I don't know. What's it called? Triple Lindy?

836
02:05:50,180 --> 02:05:54,020
A triple... What? No, it's called a...

837
02:05:55,140 --> 02:05:55,859
Hurricana?

838
02:05:55,859 --> 02:05:57,060
Hurricanrana.

839
02:05:57,619 --> 02:06:00,340
Hurricanrana. Yeah, he can do one of those.

840
02:06:00,420 --> 02:06:03,060
Did you guys... You should have seen him at the trampoline park.

841
02:06:03,060 --> 02:06:04,979
Oh, I was... I was good.

842
02:06:04,979 --> 02:06:07,140
Dude, this six-year-old came up to him and was like,

843
02:06:07,140 --> 02:06:10,420
can I help you out a bit? And he freaking hurricanrana'd him right off.

844
02:06:13,779 --> 02:06:14,279
Bam!

845
02:06:27,060 --> 02:06:28,020
You had to go home early.

846
02:06:30,329 --> 02:06:33,449
Yeah, that was you in that scenario. I hurricanrana'd you.

847
02:06:35,670 --> 02:06:39,590
He started talking shit and I just, like, jumped way high over your head and just, like,

848
02:06:39,590 --> 02:06:42,420
boom! Landed right on your shoulders.

849
02:06:42,420 --> 02:06:43,779
Twisted back and you flipped forward.

850
02:06:44,939 --> 02:06:47,260
I remember specifically the whole time you were going,

851
02:06:47,260 --> 02:06:48,699
I'm sorry! I'm wicked sorry! I'm sorry!

852
02:06:49,819 --> 02:06:51,420
What was I sorry about?

853
02:06:51,420 --> 02:06:59,590
The fact that you... What am I gonna do with this?

854
02:07:00,630 --> 02:07:01,909
What was I sorry about?

855
02:07:03,689 --> 02:07:08,579
You, like, made fun of me. You said I was acting like a six-year-old.

856
02:07:10,439 --> 02:07:15,000
No, I said you were... I said you were using wrestling moves on six-year-old.

857
02:07:16,340 --> 02:07:19,380
Oh, all right. Well, let's go ahead and move on from that conversation.

858
02:07:19,380 --> 02:07:20,899
I did rip my pants, actually.

859
02:07:21,460 --> 02:07:23,939
Yeah, you did rip your pants. That's actually rude. That's true.

860
02:07:24,579 --> 02:07:26,739
I'm... Your voice when you remembered.

861
02:07:26,739 --> 02:07:28,100
He did. He did. I can turn this on.

862
02:07:28,100 --> 02:07:29,140
No, he ripped his pants.

863
02:07:29,140 --> 02:07:30,659
It's not about me. He ripped his pants.

864
02:07:30,659 --> 02:07:31,300
He ripped his pants.

865
02:07:31,300 --> 02:07:32,100
It was embarrassing.

866
02:07:34,649 --> 02:07:35,149
Nope.

867
02:07:39,260 --> 02:07:42,300
Okay, wait. For a second. For a second.

868
02:07:43,750 --> 02:07:47,510
I thought I... I thought I threw away X.

869
02:07:48,069 --> 02:07:49,909
And I was about to be like, oh, fuck.

870
02:07:50,710 --> 02:07:52,949
Good thing I didn't throw away X.

871
02:07:54,630 --> 02:07:55,109
Yeah.

872
02:07:55,109 --> 02:07:56,390
They are shaped the same.

873
02:07:57,109 --> 02:08:04,119
All right. So, how's the episode?

874
02:08:04,680 --> 02:08:05,399
So, the vision.

875
02:08:06,739 --> 02:08:10,100
The vision. No. Yeah. Okay. You think I do embarrassing things?

876
02:08:10,979 --> 02:08:13,460
You not only have ripped your pants in front of me.

877
02:08:13,460 --> 02:08:15,220
You've also shit your pants on spring.

878
02:08:18,699 --> 02:08:25,579
So, I think I get like times one million points in the other direction.

879
02:08:25,579 --> 02:08:26,859
I won that quick play match.

880
02:08:28,699 --> 02:08:29,199
So...

881
02:08:35,579 --> 02:08:40,859
It's like, honest to God, the most fucking disgusting, fucked up thing ever.

882
02:08:43,659 --> 02:08:44,460
Ever.

883
02:08:44,460 --> 02:08:44,960
Ever.

884
02:08:50,680 --> 02:08:51,399
It's, uh...

885
02:08:51,399 --> 02:08:52,039
What am I doing?

886
02:08:52,760 --> 02:08:54,920
Pretty low of you to judge another man's butthole.

887
02:08:57,560 --> 02:08:58,920
What is this? A vacuum?

888
02:08:58,920 --> 02:09:01,399
I'm sure yours has done some things it's not too proud of.

889
02:09:01,399 --> 02:09:02,840
How do I turn on the vacuum?

890
02:09:03,960 --> 02:09:06,279
Oh, yeah. Not talking about this anymore.

891
02:09:07,159 --> 02:09:09,000
Oh, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

892
02:09:09,880 --> 02:09:10,840
Jerry! Jerry, come out here.

893
02:09:13,239 --> 02:09:14,039
Jerry, get out here.

894
02:09:14,680 --> 02:09:19,529
Hello? Get out the front door.

895
02:09:19,529 --> 02:09:20,329
What?

896
02:09:20,329 --> 02:09:21,609
Get out the front door. Out the front door. Quick.

897
02:09:23,109 --> 02:09:24,090
Why?

898
02:09:24,090 --> 02:09:25,850
Because you're about to see something amazing.

899
02:09:27,289 --> 02:09:29,289
Coming. Coming, honey.

900
02:09:29,289 --> 02:09:32,090
I found the vacuum that plays music.

901
02:09:32,090 --> 02:09:35,369
Look, I'm jumping. I'm jumping.

902
02:09:35,369 --> 02:09:35,930
Can you see me?

903
02:09:36,569 --> 02:09:41,130
Look at your map.

904
02:09:41,130 --> 02:09:41,770
Come here.

905
02:09:41,770 --> 02:09:54,579
Okay, now you do the work while I'll be the support.

906
02:09:57,210 --> 02:09:58,170
I'm your healer.

907
02:10:00,390 --> 02:10:02,149
I'm leaving if you don't get rid of that.

908
02:10:02,710 --> 02:10:05,420
I was at a vacuum.

909
02:10:10,659 --> 02:10:12,840
Wait, now we can't get it.

910
02:10:12,840 --> 02:10:14,199
I just realized what I'm doing.

911
02:10:14,199 --> 02:10:15,880
That can never turn off.

912
02:10:15,880 --> 02:10:17,479
I threw some pumpkins out there earlier.

913
02:10:22,039 --> 02:10:23,079
You're gonna get us in trouble.

914
02:10:23,079 --> 02:10:23,640
Don't do that.

915
02:10:24,439 --> 02:10:26,199
You think you can get one over the fence?

916
02:10:26,199 --> 02:10:26,520
I think so.

917
02:10:26,520 --> 02:10:27,960
We both get one throw.

918
02:10:27,960 --> 02:10:29,079
One throw to get it over the fence?

919
02:10:29,640 --> 02:10:30,680
Yeah, hold on, hold on, hold on.

920
02:10:31,880 --> 02:10:34,920
Into like, crabby Carol's yard?

921
02:10:35,560 --> 02:10:36,680
Yeah, fuck Carol.

922
02:10:39,319 --> 02:10:39,960
Holy shit.

923
02:10:39,960 --> 02:10:43,000
I just, that was like, I, there's nobody's gonna,

924
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,279
I just went to the driving range.

925
02:10:45,079 --> 02:10:45,800
No, I'm sorry.

926
02:10:45,800 --> 02:10:46,600
I went to the driving range.

927
02:10:50,140 --> 02:10:52,300
Hey, you want to take this and like throw it out?

928
02:10:53,340 --> 02:10:54,859
Dude, no, it was over the roof.

929
02:10:58,970 --> 02:11:01,130
Oh, Nuddy, no, no, no, no, no, no, Nuddy.

930
02:11:01,130 --> 02:11:03,050
Close, I'm going over Carol's roof.

931
02:11:03,050 --> 02:11:03,770
Check this shit out.

932
02:11:04,409 --> 02:11:08,460
Where'd it go?

933
02:11:09,750 --> 02:11:10,710
You got it over the house.

934
02:11:10,710 --> 02:11:11,909
Did it go so far over the house?

935
02:11:11,909 --> 02:11:12,869
It didn't go straight.

936
02:11:12,869 --> 02:11:13,909
It went off to the right.

937
02:11:18,279 --> 02:11:19,579
You got in my way.

938
02:11:19,579 --> 02:11:21,100
I don't know where mine went.

939
02:11:21,100 --> 02:11:22,460
I'm gonna assume I hit the moon.

940
02:11:25,239 --> 02:11:27,399
Okay, why do I still hear the music?

941
02:11:32,300 --> 02:11:33,500
Why is music coming from the house?

942
02:11:35,350 --> 02:11:36,789
Oh, there's a new one over here.

943
02:11:36,789 --> 02:11:39,270
Oh, get rid of this fucking thing.

944
02:11:39,909 --> 02:11:45,460
Does it spawn?

945
02:11:47,909 --> 02:11:48,869
Now I miss the music.

946
02:11:55,100 --> 02:11:56,140
All right, back upstairs.

947
02:11:57,500 --> 02:11:58,380
God damn it.

948
02:11:58,380 --> 02:11:59,180
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

949
02:11:59,180 --> 02:11:59,899
Take this trash out.

950
02:11:59,899 --> 02:12:00,859
Take the trash outside.

951
02:12:00,859 --> 02:12:02,619
When do I get my obligated?

952
02:12:02,619 --> 02:12:03,340
I'm like, ugh.

953
02:12:08,359 --> 02:12:10,680
Just running and heaving the trash into me.

954
02:12:16,420 --> 02:12:17,939
What am I doing with my trash?

955
02:12:18,739 --> 02:12:30,840
Oh my god, this music is like all in my left ear.

956
02:12:35,590 --> 02:12:36,229
Where are you?

957
02:12:36,229 --> 02:12:37,270
Are you up in the?

958
02:12:37,270 --> 02:12:38,390
I'm in the backyard.

959
02:12:38,390 --> 02:12:39,109
What are we doing?

960
02:12:39,109 --> 02:12:41,989
All right, go upstairs.

961
02:12:41,989 --> 02:12:43,189
We need to get in a bucket.

962
02:12:43,189 --> 02:12:44,069
Is that okay?

963
02:12:44,069 --> 02:12:44,550
That's fine.

964
02:12:57,699 --> 02:12:58,659
Where are you?

965
02:12:58,659 --> 02:12:59,699
I'm coming upstairs right now.

966
02:13:06,680 --> 02:13:08,439
This music is so loud and annoying.

967
02:13:09,159 --> 02:13:10,119
Why did you have to do this?

968
02:13:11,270 --> 02:13:11,989
The fuck?

969
02:13:11,989 --> 02:13:12,789
Turn your music down.

970
02:13:13,510 --> 02:13:17,060
It's really not that hard to turn your music down.

971
02:13:17,060 --> 02:13:18,819
No, it's the principle.

972
02:13:21,140 --> 02:13:22,260
Where is this coming from?

973
02:13:25,159 --> 02:13:26,199
It's like in the wall.

974
02:13:28,710 --> 02:13:30,710
Don't get that trash out of here.

975
02:13:31,670 --> 02:13:38,119
Are you going to get in Krabby Carroll's front yard?

976
02:13:47,239 --> 02:13:48,680
We're never going to complete the level now.

977
02:13:49,399 --> 02:13:54,069
I hope you're happy.

978
02:13:56,010 --> 02:13:56,810
No music.

979
02:13:56,810 --> 02:13:57,210
Quiet.

980
02:13:57,210 --> 02:13:58,649
I want complete silence.

981
02:13:58,649 --> 02:14:01,369
All right, so let's take this party upstairs.

982
02:14:03,340 --> 02:14:04,539
I'm going to bring a couple of buckets.

983
02:14:05,420 --> 02:14:05,979
Oh yeah?

984
02:14:07,020 --> 02:14:07,819
What else are you going to do?

985
02:14:09,739 --> 02:14:10,619
Oh, relax.

986
02:14:13,500 --> 02:14:14,220
Relax.

987
02:14:15,180 --> 02:14:16,140
How many buckets?

988
02:14:17,979 --> 02:14:18,479
Two.

989
02:14:20,739 --> 02:14:21,460
Oh yeah?

990
02:14:26,760 --> 02:14:32,409
Do you have one of those trash compactors up there?

991
02:14:33,449 --> 02:14:33,949
Yeah.

992
02:14:34,329 --> 02:14:36,329
There really is just party music playing.

993
02:14:37,750 --> 02:14:38,710
Why is it in the house?

994
02:14:39,859 --> 02:14:41,060
I turned my music off.

995
02:14:41,060 --> 02:14:41,539
I don't know.

996
02:14:41,539 --> 02:14:43,060
It was like in a wall and I couldn't find it.

997
02:14:43,859 --> 02:14:53,130
All right, I got two buckets of water.

998
02:14:53,770 --> 02:14:55,050
Which room are you in?

999
02:14:56,119 --> 02:14:57,159
I'm in the hallway.

1000
02:14:57,960 --> 02:14:58,960
Okay.

1001
02:14:59,500 --> 02:15:00,699
Please be careful.

1002
02:15:05,739 --> 02:15:07,260
Are you trying to do something dumb?

1003
02:15:07,979 --> 02:15:10,300
Because we need these buckets.

1004
02:15:10,939 --> 02:15:12,460
And you just came over and whacked me.

1005
02:15:16,699 --> 02:15:17,500
Won't happen again boss.

1006
02:15:17,500 --> 02:15:18,300
It's getting louder.

1007
02:15:19,579 --> 02:15:20,079
Yeah.

1008
02:15:20,460 --> 02:15:22,060
All right, so which room are we doing?

1009
02:15:22,060 --> 02:15:22,560
Excuse me.

1010
02:15:23,880 --> 02:15:24,380
This one?

1011
02:15:25,590 --> 02:15:27,829
This room is nearly done.

1012
02:15:27,829 --> 02:15:29,029
That wasn't this competition room?

1013
02:15:29,670 --> 02:15:30,869
It might have been.

1014
02:15:32,180 --> 02:15:33,300
No, you did the other one.

1015
02:15:33,300 --> 02:15:35,300
This closet is bad.

1016
02:15:39,779 --> 02:15:41,300
Ah, fuck dude.

1017
02:15:44,970 --> 02:15:46,600
What's up?

1018
02:15:47,060 --> 02:15:53,529
Are you good?

1019
02:15:53,529 --> 02:15:54,170
What happened?

1020
02:15:54,170 --> 02:15:54,970
I'm good, I'm good.

1021
02:15:55,770 --> 02:15:57,369
This one, I can take this one.

1022
02:15:57,930 --> 02:16:03,060
It's just blood, a little bit of guts.

1023
02:16:03,779 --> 02:16:04,279
I guess.

1024
02:16:04,739 --> 02:16:05,460
There's a note too.

1025
02:16:06,260 --> 02:16:12,539
Where does this lead?

1026
02:16:12,539 --> 02:16:13,039
This window.

1027
02:16:18,380 --> 02:16:18,939
We're good.

1028
02:16:18,939 --> 02:16:19,500
I'm good.

1029
02:16:19,500 --> 02:16:20,460
My room's clean.

1030
02:16:20,460 --> 02:16:21,340
I beat you.

1031
02:16:21,340 --> 02:16:21,979
My room's clean.

1032
02:16:21,979 --> 02:16:22,300
I beat you.

1033
02:16:22,300 --> 02:16:22,859
My room's clean.

1034
02:16:22,859 --> 02:16:23,979
I beat you.

1035
02:16:23,979 --> 02:16:25,180
Which window is near a thing?

1036
02:16:26,140 --> 02:16:26,779
No, that's it.

1037
02:16:27,579 --> 02:16:29,140
I think I can get it.

1038
02:16:30,659 --> 02:16:31,300
Give me a hand here.

1039
02:16:32,120 --> 02:16:32,620
No.

1040
02:16:34,090 --> 02:16:35,129
I have my own duties.

1041
02:16:36,010 --> 02:16:36,409
Got it.

1042
02:16:36,409 --> 02:16:37,209
Come on.

1043
02:16:37,209 --> 02:16:37,709
Do it.

1044
02:16:38,489 --> 02:16:38,989
Do what?

1045
02:16:40,010 --> 02:16:40,569
I'm in trouble.

1046
02:16:41,690 --> 02:16:42,729
Coming, coming.

1047
02:16:42,729 --> 02:16:44,329
I'm going to come and kill you out.

1048
02:16:44,329 --> 02:16:44,829
I don't know.

1049
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:49,559
I don't know what's going on.

1050
02:16:50,280 --> 02:16:50,840
Did you do that?

1051
02:16:52,200 --> 02:16:52,700
Do what?

1052
02:16:53,319 --> 02:16:56,040
Weirdly enough, the whole game's procedurally generated.

1053
02:16:56,760 --> 02:16:59,159
So we kind of have an issue out here.

1054
02:17:03,399 --> 02:17:04,840
I did not do that.

1055
02:17:04,840 --> 02:17:06,360
I think it's procedurally generated.

1056
02:17:07,959 --> 02:17:09,319
Hold on, I got this.

1057
02:17:09,319 --> 02:17:10,120
Did you just kill me?

1058
02:17:12,139 --> 02:17:13,020
You just killed me.

1059
02:17:13,739 --> 02:17:14,780
How did you kill me?

1060
02:17:15,899 --> 02:17:16,399
What?

1061
02:17:17,180 --> 02:17:17,659
I don't know.

1062
02:17:17,659 --> 02:17:19,739
You just goomba stomped me and broke my neck.

1063
02:17:20,299 --> 02:17:21,420
I got her off the roof.

1064
02:17:21,420 --> 02:17:22,459
Why did I die?

1065
02:17:25,819 --> 02:17:27,020
No time for your jokes.

1066
02:17:27,020 --> 02:17:28,700
Why is this about number four?

1067
02:17:32,840 --> 02:17:34,040
There is no joke there.

1068
02:17:34,040 --> 02:17:35,959
You actually jumped on my head and broke my neck.

1069
02:17:35,959 --> 02:17:36,760
That's not funny.

1070
02:17:36,760 --> 02:17:37,719
That's not funny.

1071
02:17:37,719 --> 02:17:41,639
Please don't imply that I would be involved in any tomfoolery.

1072
02:17:42,520 --> 02:17:44,600
All right, you knocked her off?

1073
02:17:44,600 --> 02:17:46,120
My mom's watching, okay?

1074
02:17:46,120 --> 02:17:46,760
Where is she?

1075
02:17:47,639 --> 02:17:49,850
What?

1076
02:17:50,229 --> 02:17:51,350
Did you knock her off the front or back?

1077
02:17:52,389 --> 02:17:53,190
My mom?

1078
02:17:53,190 --> 02:17:54,149
I threw her off the front.

1079
02:17:55,190 --> 02:17:56,229
Stop tracking it.

1080
02:17:57,190 --> 02:17:58,469
You're tracking it.

1081
02:17:58,469 --> 02:17:59,030
I don't see her.

1082
02:17:59,030 --> 02:17:59,909
Where did you knock her off?

1083
02:18:00,629 --> 02:18:03,799
She was in the bushes.

1084
02:18:03,799 --> 02:18:04,280
I got her.

1085
02:18:04,920 --> 02:18:07,510
There's still a spot of blood up there that I can't get.

1086
02:18:08,229 --> 02:18:09,559
Where did this guy come from?

1087
02:18:19,860 --> 02:18:24,969
Thanks for nothing, game.

1088
02:18:24,969 --> 02:18:25,930
Thanks for nothing.

1089
02:18:25,930 --> 02:18:27,450
When do we get guns?

1090
02:18:27,450 --> 02:18:28,569
You don't get guns.

1091
02:18:29,209 --> 02:18:30,649
Not every game has to have a gun.

1092
02:18:31,370 --> 02:18:33,770
Not every game has to have like,

1093
02:18:33,770 --> 02:18:35,530
get on the cart and shoot the gun.

1094
02:18:36,409 --> 02:18:43,479
I don't know.

1095
02:18:43,479 --> 02:18:45,000
I'm a back-in-the-day gamer.

1096
02:18:48,649 --> 02:18:49,850
A purist, if you will.

1097
02:18:50,809 --> 02:18:51,290
Why not?

1098
02:18:53,670 --> 02:18:56,069
All right, we are getting very, very close, my friend.

1099
02:19:01,610 --> 02:19:02,649
Take my buckets!

1100
02:19:04,379 --> 02:19:04,879
Hello?

1101
02:19:06,489 --> 02:19:08,250
I thought that was you, but it was me.

1102
02:19:12,100 --> 02:19:14,420
I thought you were doing a, quote,

1103
02:19:15,459 --> 02:19:16,500
German impression.

1104
02:19:16,500 --> 02:19:17,000
Hello?

1105
02:19:18,200 --> 02:19:18,700
No.

1106
02:19:18,700 --> 02:19:19,200
Hello?

1107
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:19,700
Hello?

1108
02:19:19,700 --> 02:19:20,200
Hello?

1109
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:20,700
Hello?

1110
02:19:20,700 --> 02:19:21,200
Hello?

1111
02:19:26,180 --> 02:19:26,979
Kid thinks he's funny.

1112
02:19:26,979 --> 02:19:27,479
Hello?

1113
02:19:27,479 --> 02:19:27,979
Hello?

1114
02:19:27,979 --> 02:19:28,479
Hello?

1115
02:19:29,139 --> 02:19:30,260
Fucking kid thinks he's funny.

1116
02:19:32,709 --> 02:19:33,270
That's, uh...

1117
02:19:33,989 --> 02:19:34,489
Okay.

1118
02:19:34,489 --> 02:19:35,930
When you're walking down the street,

1119
02:19:35,930 --> 02:19:38,170
and 50% of the people are germos.

1120
02:19:39,129 --> 02:19:39,629
Hello?

1121
02:19:39,629 --> 02:19:40,129
Hello?

1122
02:19:40,129 --> 02:19:40,629
Hello?

1123
02:19:40,629 --> 02:19:41,129
Hello?

1124
02:19:41,950 --> 02:19:42,750
No, I didn't see it.

1125
02:19:43,629 --> 02:19:45,629
Where else would I have come up with this if I didn't, like...

1126
02:19:45,629 --> 02:19:46,129
That's a great video.

1127
02:19:46,129 --> 02:19:47,389
You think I have an imagination?

1128
02:19:49,879 --> 02:19:50,760
Something in the attic.

1129
02:19:52,620 --> 02:19:53,500
Something in the attic.

1130
02:19:55,659 --> 02:19:56,540
Is it creepy?

1131
02:19:56,540 --> 02:19:57,340
Something in the attic.

1132
02:19:57,899 --> 02:19:59,149
I'm coming, I'm coming.

1133
02:19:59,149 --> 02:20:00,329
Oh, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it.

1134
02:20:00,329 --> 02:20:01,530
Come here, come here, come here.

1135
02:20:01,530 --> 02:20:02,030
I'm gonna...

1136
02:20:03,819 --> 02:20:04,459
Ow, my head.

1137
02:20:05,180 --> 02:20:06,620
Come here.

1138
02:20:07,079 --> 02:20:08,209
Where are you?

1139
02:20:08,750 --> 02:20:10,829
This is authentic.

1140
02:20:10,829 --> 02:20:12,190
Like, four people died on this.

1141
02:20:12,190 --> 02:20:12,690
It's gonna work.

1142
02:20:13,469 --> 02:20:14,750
Oh, shit.

1143
02:20:14,750 --> 02:20:15,629
All right, bring it to the bathroom.

1144
02:20:16,909 --> 02:20:17,549
Oh.

1145
02:20:17,549 --> 02:20:18,270
Oh, it's a weed.

1146
02:20:18,270 --> 02:20:20,750
I thought we were gonna try and go down the stairs on it.

1147
02:20:20,750 --> 02:20:21,250
No.

1148
02:20:21,559 --> 02:20:22,059
All right.

1149
02:20:22,600 --> 02:20:23,100
So...

1150
02:20:23,100 --> 02:20:25,079
Authentic people have died on this.

1151
02:20:25,079 --> 02:20:25,579
Vooja.

1152
02:20:27,530 --> 02:20:28,329
All right, you ready?

1153
02:20:28,329 --> 02:20:28,969
Put your hand on my...

1154
02:20:28,969 --> 02:20:29,690
Put your hand on my hand.

1155
02:20:31,959 --> 02:20:32,360
Thanks.

1156
02:20:32,360 --> 02:20:32,860
Okay.

1157
02:20:32,920 --> 02:20:33,420
Okay.

1158
02:20:33,639 --> 02:20:35,100
No, wait, we need to...

1159
02:20:35,100 --> 02:20:35,600
I need to...

1160
02:20:36,799 --> 02:20:37,299
Ghost!

1161
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:38,260
So...

1162
02:20:38,260 --> 02:20:39,360
Ghost, can you hear us?

1163
02:20:39,360 --> 02:20:39,860
When the tip is on that.

1164
02:20:39,860 --> 02:20:40,360
Hello?

1165
02:20:40,799 --> 02:20:42,940
All right, you ready?

1166
02:20:43,399 --> 02:20:43,899
Take...

1167
02:20:43,899 --> 02:20:44,399
Grab my hand.

1168
02:20:44,399 --> 02:20:44,899
Tight.

1169
02:20:44,899 --> 02:20:45,399
Tighter.

1170
02:20:45,399 --> 02:20:46,200
I'm tight.

1171
02:20:46,200 --> 02:20:46,700
Ow!

1172
02:20:46,700 --> 02:20:47,319
Fucking God!

1173
02:20:47,319 --> 02:20:48,040
Not that hard.

1174
02:20:48,040 --> 02:20:48,840
What's wrong with you?

1175
02:20:49,659 --> 02:20:50,159
Tighter.

1176
02:20:51,020 --> 02:20:51,520
Dear...

1177
02:20:51,659 --> 02:20:52,159
Ow.

1178
02:20:52,159 --> 02:20:55,020
Dear spirits of the realm of...

1179
02:20:55,579 --> 02:20:57,760
Let's turn the light off.

1180
02:20:57,760 --> 02:20:58,260
Can we?

1181
02:20:59,600 --> 02:21:00,559
Uh, yeah.

1182
02:21:00,559 --> 02:21:05,889
Oh, that door closed by itself!

1183
02:21:07,860 --> 02:21:10,290
Okay, hand back on.

1184
02:21:10,290 --> 02:21:10,790
Okay.

1185
02:21:11,520 --> 02:21:14,850
Spirits of the otherworldly creatures,

1186
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:17,120
give us a sign.

1187
02:21:17,120 --> 02:21:21,420
Are you here in the room with us right now?

1188
02:21:21,420 --> 02:21:22,219
No, I was talking about the...

1189
02:21:22,219 --> 02:21:23,579
Yeah, I was talking about the ear.

1190
02:21:23,579 --> 02:21:24,079
You fuck...

1191
02:21:24,079 --> 02:21:27,260
Stop fucking up the spirit mojo here.

1192
02:21:27,260 --> 02:21:27,760
Come on.

1193
02:21:28,399 --> 02:21:28,899
Okay.

1194
02:21:29,620 --> 02:21:30,739
Are you in the room right now?

1195
02:21:31,420 --> 02:21:33,100
You fucking guys are so bad at this game.

1196
02:21:33,100 --> 02:21:34,459
Like, I'm missing dinner now.

1197
02:21:34,459 --> 02:21:38,610
Are you doing this?

1198
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:40,559
Yeah, what?

1199
02:21:40,559 --> 02:21:41,059
No.

1200
02:21:41,059 --> 02:21:42,239
Are you moving this?

1201
02:21:42,239 --> 02:21:43,040
I'm not doing this.

1202
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:43,680
Are you doing this?

1203
02:21:43,680 --> 02:21:44,180
Yeah.

1204
02:21:44,479 --> 02:21:46,270
Yeah, I am.

1205
02:21:46,270 --> 02:21:48,129
I'm moving it.

1206
02:21:48,129 --> 02:21:48,629
No, wait.

1207
02:21:48,629 --> 02:21:49,129
No, I'm not.

1208
02:21:49,129 --> 02:21:49,809
That's not how this works.

1209
02:21:50,610 --> 02:21:51,969
Put your hand back on.

1210
02:21:53,180 --> 02:21:53,680
Ow.

1211
02:21:53,680 --> 02:21:54,860
You just admitted you were moving it.

1212
02:21:54,860 --> 02:21:55,500
No, just put it down.

1213
02:21:55,500 --> 02:21:56,000
Put it down.

1214
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:56,500
No.

1215
02:21:57,389 --> 02:21:57,889
Okay.

1216
02:21:57,889 --> 02:21:58,510
Okay, it's down.

1217
02:21:58,510 --> 02:21:59,010
It's down.

1218
02:21:59,469 --> 02:21:59,969
Hold on.

1219
02:21:59,969 --> 02:22:01,149
Wait, we gotta get some more blood on this.

1220
02:22:02,670 --> 02:22:03,170
Hold on.

1221
02:22:03,170 --> 02:22:03,670
Wait.

1222
02:22:04,350 --> 02:22:05,469
Just keep it there right there.

1223
02:22:06,030 --> 02:22:06,989
Get in the shower with me.

1224
02:22:08,350 --> 02:22:10,450
Wait a minute.

1225
02:22:10,450 --> 02:22:10,950
Oh shit.

1226
02:22:11,889 --> 02:22:12,389
Okay.

1227
02:22:12,389 --> 02:22:13,010
I thought it was done.

1228
02:22:15,489 --> 02:22:16,530
It's too dark.

1229
02:22:17,170 --> 02:22:18,370
It's too dark in the house.

1230
02:22:19,170 --> 02:22:19,969
I can't see.

1231
02:22:21,840 --> 02:22:22,239
I don't know.

1232
02:22:22,239 --> 02:22:24,079
My camera's turned way fucking down.

1233
02:22:24,079 --> 02:22:24,319
All right.

1234
02:22:24,319 --> 02:22:25,040
Where's the bathroom?

1235
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:26,159
All right.

1236
02:22:26,159 --> 02:22:26,719
I need blood.

1237
02:22:26,719 --> 02:22:27,280
Give me blood.

1238
02:22:27,280 --> 02:22:27,840
I need blood.

1239
02:22:28,479 --> 02:22:29,360
Why do you need blood?

1240
02:22:29,360 --> 02:22:30,239
Because I need to...

1241
02:22:30,239 --> 02:22:30,559
All right.

1242
02:22:30,559 --> 02:22:31,280
It's bloodied up.

1243
02:22:31,280 --> 02:22:31,600
Good.

1244
02:22:31,600 --> 02:22:32,100
Set it down.

1245
02:22:36,989 --> 02:22:37,309
All right.

1246
02:22:37,309 --> 02:22:39,069
Let's close the fucking door.

1247
02:22:39,069 --> 02:22:40,909
Everyone, put your seat belts back on.

1248
02:22:40,909 --> 02:22:41,149
All right.

1249
02:22:41,149 --> 02:22:41,870
Put your seat belts on.

1250
02:22:41,870 --> 02:22:42,510
Put your hand...

1251
02:22:43,149 --> 02:22:46,430
Put your hand on my hand.

1252
02:22:46,430 --> 02:22:46,829
What?

1253
02:22:46,829 --> 02:22:47,069
Ow.

1254
02:22:47,069 --> 02:22:48,190
Why was my face?

1255
02:22:48,190 --> 02:22:49,389
Put your hand on my fucking hand.

1256
02:22:49,389 --> 02:22:49,629
No.

1257
02:22:49,629 --> 02:22:51,790
I was doing the clapper for the video.

1258
02:22:53,729 --> 02:22:54,049
Okay.

1259
02:22:55,600 --> 02:22:56,000
Grasp.

1260
02:22:57,090 --> 02:22:57,489
Yo.

1261
02:22:57,489 --> 02:22:58,370
What's going on, everybody?

1262
02:22:58,370 --> 02:22:59,250
Just being German here.

1263
02:22:59,250 --> 02:22:59,489
Hey.

1264
02:22:59,489 --> 02:23:00,209
What's going on, everybody?

1265
02:23:00,209 --> 02:23:00,610
We're here.

1266
02:23:00,610 --> 02:23:01,889
We're doing the Ouija board.

1267
02:23:01,889 --> 02:23:02,290
Are you ready?

1268
02:23:02,290 --> 02:23:03,489
Spirits, are you in the room with us?

1269
02:23:04,370 --> 02:23:07,180
Dude, this is fucking freaky.

1270
02:23:07,180 --> 02:23:07,899
Is this you doing that?

1271
02:23:08,940 --> 02:23:10,059
I don't think it's me doing it.

1272
02:23:11,700 --> 02:23:12,340
This is on yes.

1273
02:23:13,700 --> 02:23:14,340
Oh my god.

1274
02:23:14,340 --> 02:23:14,739
No, no, no.

1275
02:23:14,739 --> 02:23:16,260
Don't touch it.

1276
02:23:16,260 --> 02:23:17,219
I'm not touching it.

1277
02:23:17,219 --> 02:23:17,860
I'm not.

1278
02:23:17,860 --> 02:23:18,979
What the fuck is happening then?

1279
02:23:19,540 --> 02:23:19,780
Okay.

1280
02:23:20,500 --> 02:23:22,979
Spirits, are you moving around the object?

1281
02:23:23,780 --> 02:23:26,110
I'm not touching it, dude.

1282
02:23:26,110 --> 02:23:27,149
I'm not touching this.

1283
02:23:27,149 --> 02:23:28,030
I never touched it.

1284
02:23:30,620 --> 02:23:30,780
G.

1285
02:23:31,420 --> 02:23:32,959
What's G?

1286
02:23:32,959 --> 02:23:34,879
Do you have a family member named G?

1287
02:23:35,600 --> 02:23:36,940
Oh my god.

1288
02:23:36,940 --> 02:23:37,500
It's for you.

1289
02:23:37,500 --> 02:23:38,540
It's Germa.

1290
02:23:38,540 --> 02:23:39,420
No, that's a J.

1291
02:23:39,420 --> 02:23:40,940
Do you have anybody named G?

1292
02:23:41,579 --> 02:23:43,629
Oh my god.

1293
02:23:43,629 --> 02:23:44,350
It's Gerald.

1294
02:23:46,299 --> 02:23:46,860
Are you doing this?

1295
02:23:46,860 --> 02:23:47,979
I'm serious.

1296
02:23:47,979 --> 02:23:48,299
I'm serious.

1297
02:23:48,299 --> 02:23:48,780
Are you doing this?

1298
02:23:49,260 --> 02:23:50,540
Are you moving this?

1299
02:23:52,510 --> 02:23:52,829
A.

1300
02:23:52,829 --> 02:23:53,069
G.

1301
02:23:53,069 --> 02:23:53,229
A.

1302
02:23:55,069 --> 02:23:55,469
Gary.

1303
02:23:55,469 --> 02:23:56,829
Do you know anybody in the family named Gary?

1304
02:23:57,469 --> 02:23:57,950
No.

1305
02:23:57,950 --> 02:23:59,149
Spirit, are you Gary?

1306
02:24:00,239 --> 02:24:01,040
No, not Gary.

1307
02:24:02,479 --> 02:24:04,559
Spirit, spell the rest of your name.

1308
02:24:08,930 --> 02:24:09,090
M.

1309
02:24:11,760 --> 02:24:12,079
Gam.

1310
02:24:13,040 --> 02:24:13,920
Gam.

1311
02:24:13,920 --> 02:24:14,239
Gam.

1312
02:24:14,959 --> 02:24:15,440
Game.

1313
02:24:15,440 --> 02:24:16,799
Game, game, game, game, game, game, game.

1314
02:24:16,799 --> 02:24:17,520
Put it down.

1315
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:18,079
Are you touching this?

1316
02:24:18,719 --> 02:24:18,959
No.

1317
02:24:19,700 --> 02:24:19,940
Fuck.

1318
02:24:20,500 --> 02:24:22,000
It's on the S.

1319
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:23,040
Fuck, dude.

1320
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:24,079
Gam.

1321
02:24:24,079 --> 02:24:24,639
Gam's.

1322
02:24:24,639 --> 02:24:25,360
Game sucks.

1323
02:24:25,920 --> 02:24:27,649
I'm not moving this.

1324
02:24:28,579 --> 02:24:29,059
Gam6.

1325
02:24:29,620 --> 02:24:33,379
Gam, I think that's the demon's name.

1326
02:24:33,379 --> 02:24:33,940
Gam6.

1327
02:24:33,940 --> 02:24:34,579
Gam6.

1328
02:24:34,579 --> 02:24:36,420
Oh, terrible demon of ours.

1329
02:24:37,500 --> 02:24:38,620
What do you want us to do?

1330
02:24:47,549 --> 02:24:48,829
Oh, okay, sorry.

1331
02:24:51,700 --> 02:24:52,500
Gam6.

1332
02:24:52,500 --> 02:24:55,219
I forget where the letter is, Gam6.

1333
02:24:55,219 --> 02:24:58,500
I don't remember where the letter is in the alphabet because we're upside down.

1334
02:24:59,219 --> 02:25:01,860
Gam6, please move me in the right direction if you could, please.

1335
02:25:03,069 --> 02:25:03,709
Gam6.

1336
02:25:03,709 --> 02:25:04,190
Oh.

1337
02:25:04,190 --> 02:25:04,590
Whoa.

1338
02:25:04,590 --> 02:25:05,229
Oh, fuck.

1339
02:25:06,129 --> 02:25:10,530
He just made me move over here.

1340
02:25:10,530 --> 02:25:10,850
Q.

1341
02:25:13,100 --> 02:25:13,659
Are you moving this?

1342
02:25:16,370 --> 02:25:16,610
You?

1343
02:25:17,569 --> 02:25:17,889
Can we?

1344
02:25:19,940 --> 02:25:20,500
There's an I.

1345
02:25:20,500 --> 02:25:21,219
I think that's an I.

1346
02:25:22,610 --> 02:25:22,930
Quit.

1347
02:25:22,930 --> 02:25:23,250
Quit.

1348
02:25:23,889 --> 02:25:42,129
Are you moving this?

1349
02:25:43,090 --> 02:25:43,729
I'm not moving it.

1350
02:25:43,729 --> 02:25:44,370
Are you moving this?

1351
02:25:45,329 --> 02:25:46,049
Are you moving this?

1352
02:25:46,049 --> 02:25:46,770
Are you doing this?

1353
02:25:48,610 --> 02:25:49,569
Is that you moving this?

1354
02:25:49,569 --> 02:25:50,530
Dude, stop me moving this.

1355
02:25:51,409 --> 02:25:52,370
Dude, are you moving this, dude?

1356
02:25:53,170 --> 02:25:54,129
Dude, stop me moving this.

1357
02:25:57,020 --> 02:25:57,579
It's not me.

1358
02:25:58,219 --> 02:25:58,860
Are you moving that?

1359
02:25:59,579 --> 02:26:01,020
Oh my god, is this the demon lord?

1360
02:26:01,020 --> 02:26:01,659
Game sucks.

1361
02:26:02,299 --> 02:26:03,180
Dude, are you picking this up?

1362
02:26:03,180 --> 02:26:03,739
Did you move this?

1363
02:26:04,459 --> 02:26:09,700
Dude, I'm walking down the stairs.

1364
02:26:09,700 --> 02:26:10,819
Are you walking down the stairs right now?

1365
02:26:10,819 --> 02:26:11,379
I'm not.

1366
02:26:11,379 --> 02:26:14,879
Am I?

1367
02:26:14,879 --> 02:26:15,760
Good job.

1368
02:26:15,760 --> 02:26:16,399
Oh, shit.

1369
02:26:16,399 --> 02:26:18,959
I even said that you hit the first funny part.

1370
02:26:18,959 --> 02:26:19,600
Dude.

1371
02:26:19,600 --> 02:26:20,319
Are you moving this?

1372
02:26:26,350 --> 02:26:27,950
I gotta turn my game back up.

1373
02:26:27,950 --> 02:26:32,209
What was it at one?

1374
02:26:32,850 --> 02:26:37,170
Dude, are you moving this?

1375
02:26:38,180 --> 02:26:39,139
I'm not moving this.

1376
02:26:39,139 --> 02:26:39,700
Are you sure?

1377
02:26:39,700 --> 02:26:40,899
I- something's fucking weird.

1378
02:26:41,940 --> 02:26:43,059
I'm not moving this.

1379
02:26:46,209 --> 02:26:47,250
All right, get- move.

1380
02:26:48,989 --> 02:26:49,790
I'm not moving.

1381
02:26:51,920 --> 02:26:53,040
Let's go clean the house.

1382
02:26:58,239 --> 02:27:02,079
Why did you have to bring that up here?

1383
02:27:03,170 --> 02:27:05,250
So that you can see what you're doing.

1384
02:27:05,250 --> 02:27:05,569
Thanks.

1385
02:27:09,780 --> 02:27:12,879
That actually is way too bright though, for real.

1386
02:27:12,879 --> 02:27:13,520
Like, get rid of this.

1387
02:27:17,309 --> 02:27:18,829
This isn't as good as Seinfeld.

1388
02:27:19,469 --> 02:27:20,610
Where did that go?

1389
02:27:21,250 --> 02:27:23,180
How are you still holding that?

1390
02:27:23,899 --> 02:27:25,180
You can't take it out of my hand.

1391
02:27:25,180 --> 02:27:26,139
My hands are too strong.

1392
02:27:26,139 --> 02:27:27,899
I have pure titanium grip strength.

1393
02:27:28,459 --> 02:27:29,260
Okay.

1394
02:27:29,260 --> 02:27:30,059
The bathroom's clean.

1395
02:27:30,620 --> 02:27:32,379
No one's ever taken anything from my hand.

1396
02:27:33,180 --> 02:27:33,819
The bathroom's clean.

1397
02:27:34,780 --> 02:27:35,819
My hands are massive.

1398
02:27:36,540 --> 02:27:37,819
They have like hairy knuckles.

1399
02:27:38,459 --> 02:27:39,420
Veins popping out.

1400
02:27:42,829 --> 02:27:43,149
Gross.

1401
02:27:45,540 --> 02:27:47,860
Yeah, but you think it'd be nice to be held by these hands.

1402
02:27:47,860 --> 02:27:50,180
I got veinier hands than you, I guarantee it.

1403
02:27:50,659 --> 02:27:51,860
I'm vascular.

1404
02:27:51,860 --> 02:27:53,860
I have the veiniest hands in the world.

1405
02:27:53,860 --> 02:27:54,579
I swear to God.

1406
02:27:56,239 --> 02:27:56,879
Let's compare.

1407
02:27:56,879 --> 02:27:57,200
Come here.

1408
02:27:57,200 --> 02:27:57,760
Show me your hands.

1409
02:27:57,760 --> 02:27:58,639
Honestly, if- if-

1410
02:27:59,360 --> 02:28:02,799
You would think that I was an old lady if you saw my hands up close.

1411
02:28:02,799 --> 02:28:04,079
That's not vascular.

1412
02:28:04,079 --> 02:28:05,120
That's wrinkly.

1413
02:28:05,120 --> 02:28:05,760
No, no, no, no, no.

1414
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:06,399
You don't understand.

1415
02:28:06,959 --> 02:28:09,360
Like, my veins pop the fuck out of my hands.

1416
02:28:14,270 --> 02:28:15,149
Okay, you win.

1417
02:28:16,030 --> 02:28:18,319
We should compare hands.

1418
02:28:19,040 --> 02:28:30,850
I mean, it's the music that's doing it to me too.

1419
02:28:31,489 --> 02:28:32,129
Show hands.

1420
02:28:33,540 --> 02:28:34,819
Are you- are you on camera?

1421
02:28:34,819 --> 02:28:35,780
Are you like decent right now?

1422
02:28:36,770 --> 02:28:38,450
My camera isn't plugged in.

1423
02:28:38,450 --> 02:28:41,170
Well, they're not that vein-y right now.

1424
02:28:41,170 --> 02:28:41,809
They kind of are.

1425
02:28:42,370 --> 02:28:44,079
Should I prove it?

1426
02:28:46,579 --> 02:28:46,979
Prove it.

1427
02:28:46,979 --> 02:28:47,379
Prove it.

1428
02:28:48,020 --> 02:28:49,809
Prove how veinier your hand is.

1429
02:28:49,809 --> 02:28:50,930
I'm opening the stream.

1430
02:28:50,930 --> 02:28:51,889
I need to see.

1431
02:28:51,889 --> 02:28:52,209
Prove it.

1432
02:28:52,209 --> 02:28:53,569
Let's get vein in that.

1433
02:28:53,569 --> 02:28:54,049
Yeah, I know.

1434
02:28:54,049 --> 02:28:55,569
I'm wearing the same shirt as I was yesterday.

1435
02:28:55,569 --> 02:28:55,969
Deal with it.

1436
02:28:55,969 --> 02:28:56,610
It's 100 degrees.

1437
02:28:58,430 --> 02:28:58,670
Wait.

1438
02:28:59,229 --> 02:29:02,030
It being 100 degrees is why you're wearing the same shirt.

1439
02:29:02,590 --> 02:29:03,069
Look at that.

1440
02:29:03,629 --> 02:29:05,459
Look at those.

1441
02:29:05,459 --> 02:29:05,860
Look at that.

1442
02:29:06,500 --> 02:29:08,159
Are you shitting me, dude?

1443
02:29:08,719 --> 02:29:12,430
Can I get a light on that?

1444
02:29:12,430 --> 02:29:13,069
Get a light on it.

1445
02:29:15,200 --> 02:29:16,559
No, you're not- hold on.

1446
02:29:17,360 --> 02:29:18,000
You turn the light.

1447
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:19,680
You turn- you got the wrong side.

1448
02:29:20,399 --> 02:29:20,799
No, no, no.

1449
02:29:20,799 --> 02:29:21,520
That's towards you.

1450
02:29:22,239 --> 02:29:22,719
Towards me.

1451
02:29:25,360 --> 02:29:26,879
Not in my fucking eyes.

1452
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:28,670
Okay.

1453
02:29:29,309 --> 02:29:29,709
Can you see?

1454
02:29:31,180 --> 02:29:31,420
Yeah.

1455
02:29:32,540 --> 02:29:33,899
No, my hands are way bigger.

1456
02:29:34,620 --> 02:29:35,739
Like hairier.

1457
02:29:37,059 --> 02:29:37,940
More defined.

1458
02:29:37,940 --> 02:29:38,979
And more vascular.

1459
02:29:39,620 --> 02:29:40,739
And thank you.

1460
02:29:40,739 --> 02:29:42,260
Put the fucking light down, dick.

1461
02:29:42,260 --> 02:29:44,100
Like you still- it's right in my face.

1462
02:29:45,709 --> 02:29:46,590
Never letting go of it.

1463
02:29:46,590 --> 02:29:47,309
Asshole.

1464
02:29:47,309 --> 02:29:48,350
You can't get inside of my hands.

1465
02:29:48,350 --> 02:29:49,629
Not with trickery.

1466
02:29:49,629 --> 02:29:51,069
Not with force.

1467
02:29:51,069 --> 02:29:52,430
Ooh, that was an explosion.

1468
02:29:54,399 --> 02:29:55,920
Oh, is that my switch that went all the way down?

1469
02:29:55,920 --> 02:29:56,399
No, it's not.

1470
02:29:56,399 --> 02:29:56,879
Thank God.

1471
02:29:56,879 --> 02:29:57,920
I was supposed to be fucking sad.

1472
02:29:57,920 --> 02:29:58,559
Look at those hands.

1473
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:05,469
Wait a second.

1474
02:30:06,110 --> 02:30:07,389
Are you moving this?

1475
02:30:08,110 --> 02:30:09,069
I'm not moving that.

1476
02:30:09,709 --> 02:30:12,899
What about now?

1477
02:30:13,540 --> 02:30:14,819
Are you moving this?

1478
02:30:14,819 --> 02:30:15,459
No, you are.

1479
02:30:16,340 --> 02:30:20,290
Can you get me- can you get me out of the bathroom, please?

1480
02:30:20,850 --> 02:30:21,569
I'm not moving that.

1481
02:30:22,209 --> 02:30:22,850
I'm not moving it.

1482
02:30:22,850 --> 02:30:23,649
Get me out of the bathroom.

1483
02:30:24,290 --> 02:30:30,000
I get you to wipe your ass.

1484
02:30:32,579 --> 02:30:33,379
We're almost done.

1485
02:30:33,379 --> 02:30:36,420
We're at the finish line and we're wiping each other's asses.

1486
02:30:39,969 --> 02:30:40,290
All right.

1487
02:30:41,409 --> 02:30:46,909
I've reached the level of like we're so close to being done

1488
02:30:46,909 --> 02:30:50,110
that it- we can't finish because we're so close.

1489
02:30:51,149 --> 02:30:52,110
That's why we can't finish.

1490
02:30:52,110 --> 02:30:52,989
What is this?

1491
02:30:53,950 --> 02:30:56,620
We still have that whole other house.

1492
02:30:56,620 --> 02:30:57,260
What is this?

1493
02:30:58,059 --> 02:30:59,500
Oh, scary.

1494
02:31:00,139 --> 02:31:02,459
Yeah, there's a home of the house here, right?

1495
02:31:02,459 --> 02:31:07,790
Is that a book?

1496
02:31:07,790 --> 02:31:15,790
All right, I cleaned up the book.

1497
02:31:16,940 --> 02:31:18,139
All right, this is the house.

1498
02:31:18,139 --> 02:31:19,020
Let's do a walkthrough.

1499
02:31:19,659 --> 02:31:20,959
Come with me.

1500
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:22,719
Bring the ghost light.

1501
02:31:22,719 --> 02:31:24,159
Why do I have to come like-

1502
02:31:24,959 --> 02:31:27,360
Because we're having a fun time in the game together

1503
02:31:27,360 --> 02:31:28,000
and you need to find-

1504
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,719
I'm having so much fun.

1505
02:31:30,719 --> 02:31:32,239
You fucking guys are so bad at this game.

1506
02:31:32,239 --> 02:31:33,440
Well, hey, I'm missing dinner now.

1507
02:31:37,229 --> 02:31:37,790
Calm down.

1508
02:31:37,790 --> 02:31:38,430
Okay, walkthrough.

1509
02:31:39,069 --> 02:31:44,370
There's a USB here.

1510
02:31:44,370 --> 02:31:45,090
Yeah, pick it up.

1511
02:31:46,639 --> 02:31:47,760
There's a couple of these-

1512
02:31:49,360 --> 02:31:51,680
There's a couple of mobile toilets in the bathroom.

1513
02:31:52,319 --> 02:31:54,959
Let me get these mobile toilets out.

1514
02:31:57,659 --> 02:32:06,420
Looks good.

1515
02:32:06,420 --> 02:32:08,940
I'll put this pumpkin here.

1516
02:32:08,940 --> 02:32:09,579
Looks good.

1517
02:32:11,620 --> 02:32:13,940
Ah, excuse me.

1518
02:32:16,219 --> 02:32:17,020
Not done.

1519
02:32:21,440 --> 02:32:22,479
I never saw the attic

1520
02:32:22,479 --> 02:32:24,159
because you had to do the Ouija board thing.

1521
02:32:24,799 --> 02:32:25,760
What Ouija board thing?

1522
02:32:26,559 --> 02:32:30,000
I don't know.

1523
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:30,639
I don't remember.

1524
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:33,659
And you brought trash up here, too.

1525
02:32:34,379 --> 02:32:47,840
All right, what would it take me to drink trash juice?

1526
02:32:54,750 --> 02:32:55,229
Wait, what?

1527
02:32:55,229 --> 02:32:56,590
You're not even going to give me a response to that one.

1528
02:32:56,590 --> 02:32:56,909
Come here.

1529
02:32:57,549 --> 02:33:03,620
Well, I'm paying attention.

1530
02:33:04,340 --> 02:33:05,889
Sorry.

1531
02:33:05,889 --> 02:33:16,180
Okay, the attic.

1532
02:33:16,180 --> 02:33:16,739
Did you see the attic?

1533
02:33:16,739 --> 02:33:17,379
It's pretty crazy.

1534
02:33:17,940 --> 02:33:27,309
Why did you bring this upstairs?

1535
02:33:27,309 --> 02:33:28,590
Getting it out of such a pain in the ass.

1536
02:33:30,110 --> 02:33:32,110
You brought the trash all the way up the stairs.

1537
02:33:32,989 --> 02:33:36,479
Jarma.

1538
02:33:36,479 --> 02:33:37,440
Jarma.

1539
02:33:37,440 --> 02:33:37,760
Yes.

1540
02:33:38,399 --> 02:33:39,360
There's been a murder.

1541
02:33:40,079 --> 02:33:40,719
What murder?

1542
02:33:40,719 --> 02:33:41,200
Where?

1543
02:33:41,200 --> 02:33:44,079
I don't think this house is as normal as it seems.

1544
02:33:44,959 --> 02:33:47,069
There's been a murder.

1545
02:33:49,659 --> 02:33:50,459
No shit.

1546
02:33:50,459 --> 02:33:51,819
There's like 30 dead people here.

1547
02:33:54,129 --> 02:33:54,610
What are you trying-

1548
02:33:54,610 --> 02:33:55,649
What's going on here?

1549
02:33:55,649 --> 02:33:59,010
You're just putting splats all over the ceiling and the wall and stuff.

1550
02:33:59,569 --> 02:34:00,049
Hello?

1551
02:34:00,610 --> 02:34:01,940
Did you hear that?

1552
02:34:03,579 --> 02:34:05,020
I think maybe he's still alive.

1553
02:34:08,139 --> 02:34:09,500
I think that's coming from the attic.

1554
02:34:09,500 --> 02:34:10,059
Hello?

1555
02:34:10,059 --> 02:34:11,020
It's coming from the attic.

1556
02:34:11,020 --> 02:34:11,260
Okay.

1557
02:34:12,219 --> 02:34:13,299
Where's the attic?

1558
02:34:14,670 --> 02:34:15,629
It's in here.

1559
02:34:15,629 --> 02:34:16,590
This is the attic up here?

1560
02:34:17,309 --> 02:34:18,670
No, wrong room.

1561
02:34:18,670 --> 02:34:19,549
It's coming from over there.

1562
02:34:19,549 --> 02:34:19,950
Hello?

1563
02:34:19,950 --> 02:34:20,750
Over here?

1564
02:34:20,750 --> 02:34:21,309
I hear it.

1565
02:34:21,309 --> 02:34:21,709
Up here.

1566
02:34:22,510 --> 02:34:23,600
I hear it.

1567
02:34:23,600 --> 02:34:23,840
Is it-

1568
02:34:25,280 --> 02:34:25,680
Get a camera.

1569
02:34:25,680 --> 02:34:26,319
Get a camera up.

1570
02:34:29,780 --> 02:34:30,739
What's in here?

1571
02:34:30,739 --> 02:34:31,620
This is fucked up though.

1572
02:34:32,340 --> 02:34:38,059
Anybody here?

1573
02:34:41,540 --> 02:34:41,780
All right.

1574
02:34:42,500 --> 02:34:43,299
All right, Dave.

1575
02:34:43,299 --> 02:34:44,340
No more fucking around.

1576
02:34:44,340 --> 02:34:45,459
Like you're messing around with me.

1577
02:34:48,750 --> 02:34:50,190
Okay, real funny, Dave.

1578
02:34:52,159 --> 02:34:53,280
Like, haha, got me.

1579
02:34:56,190 --> 02:34:57,299
Hello?

1580
02:34:57,299 --> 02:34:57,700
Hello?

1581
02:34:59,860 --> 02:35:00,579
No, you are.

1582
02:35:01,139 --> 02:35:03,389
Well, I'm gonna get rid of this.

1583
02:35:03,389 --> 02:35:05,700
I can't.

1584
02:35:05,700 --> 02:35:06,260
I need a bucket.

1585
02:35:06,979 --> 02:35:08,190
Hey, Dave.

1586
02:35:10,129 --> 02:35:12,290
Yo, it's time to go, man.

1587
02:35:13,409 --> 02:35:16,180
What are you doing?

1588
02:35:18,079 --> 02:35:19,120
Look at this mess.

1589
02:35:19,840 --> 02:35:31,760
You know, you're just adding more time than we have to be in this map.

1590
02:35:33,200 --> 02:35:34,239
We have to.

1591
02:35:34,239 --> 02:35:35,040
Not let-

1592
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:37,680
You think that we're gonna leave without cleaning this up?

1593
02:35:39,899 --> 02:35:41,899
I think I'm fully capable of it.

1594
02:35:41,899 --> 02:35:42,399
No!

1595
02:35:43,579 --> 02:35:44,459
I think I could just-

1596
02:35:44,459 --> 02:35:45,260
No, no, no.

1597
02:35:45,260 --> 02:35:45,739
You can't.

1598
02:35:45,739 --> 02:35:46,379
Because that-

1599
02:35:46,379 --> 02:35:47,739
I'm in your game.

1600
02:35:47,739 --> 02:35:48,379
No, no, no, no.

1601
02:35:48,379 --> 02:35:48,940
It was done.

1602
02:35:48,940 --> 02:35:49,340
It was done.

1603
02:35:49,340 --> 02:35:50,059
And we could have clocked out.

1604
02:35:50,059 --> 02:35:51,500
I mean, neither of us cleaned it.

1605
02:35:51,500 --> 02:35:53,579
All right, well, just at least get the USBs.

1606
02:35:53,579 --> 02:35:57,780
Where'd you put them?

1607
02:35:57,780 --> 02:35:59,299
I'm not playing games with you.

1608
02:35:59,299 --> 02:36:00,260
Where are-

1609
02:36:00,260 --> 02:36:01,459
Where are the USBs?

1610
02:36:01,459 --> 02:36:03,059
I'm not playing games with you.

1611
02:36:03,059 --> 02:36:03,860
Turn in the USBs.

1612
02:36:05,040 --> 02:36:07,629
I think I saw them over here.

1613
02:36:07,629 --> 02:36:08,750
At least turn those in for me.

1614
02:36:13,920 --> 02:36:15,120
Come out the house.

1615
02:36:15,120 --> 02:36:15,840
Where are they?

1616
02:36:19,649 --> 02:36:20,450
Where are you?

1617
02:36:20,450 --> 02:36:26,420
I'm not playing games with you.

1618
02:36:26,420 --> 02:36:30,530
Huh? Hello?

1619
02:36:34,979 --> 02:36:36,500
Okay, man.

1620
02:36:39,100 --> 02:36:43,340
I'm gonna just hang out for a bit and maybe I'll talk to you some other time, man.

1621
02:36:43,340 --> 02:36:43,979
But I've gotta-

1622
02:36:43,979 --> 02:36:44,780
I've gotta go.

1623
02:36:45,819 --> 02:36:46,620
The fuck?

1624
02:36:49,149 --> 02:36:49,870
No, you are.

1625
02:36:54,319 --> 02:36:55,040
Hey, rookie!

1626
02:36:57,069 --> 02:36:58,450
Rookie, what?

1627
02:36:58,450 --> 02:37:00,209
I thought you were gonna keep doing the demon thing.

1628
02:37:00,209 --> 02:37:01,809
Nice fucking RP ruin.

1629
02:37:01,809 --> 02:37:02,370
What?

1630
02:37:02,370 --> 02:37:03,329
I wasn't doing a demon thing.

1631
02:37:03,329 --> 02:37:05,170
Nice ruined RP.

1632
02:37:05,170 --> 02:37:07,250
I wasn't doing a demon thing, Jerma.

1633
02:37:08,659 --> 02:37:11,379
It's coming from inside the house.

1634
02:37:15,010 --> 02:37:16,129
Is it coming from the toilet?

1635
02:37:17,649 --> 02:37:18,530
Is he in the bath?

1636
02:37:27,219 --> 02:37:28,659
Is he currently taking a bath?

1637
02:37:30,020 --> 02:37:30,340
All right.

1638
02:37:31,379 --> 02:37:34,420
Can I get in the bathroom, please?

1639
02:37:38,079 --> 02:37:40,750
Excuse me.

1640
02:37:51,899 --> 02:37:52,780
Game six. Oh, fuck.

1641
02:37:55,219 --> 02:37:56,100
What do you want from us?

1642
02:37:56,739 --> 02:38:09,280
I want my house clean and you're gonna fuck it up.

1643
02:38:09,280 --> 02:38:13,760
I mean, we're just trying to entertain some people and make them laugh.

1644
02:38:15,629 --> 02:38:19,149
You were hired for a job and you're goofing around.

1645
02:38:19,149 --> 02:38:19,950
I mean-

1646
02:38:19,950 --> 02:38:23,180
I'd have an ear to take this up with you.

1647
02:38:23,180 --> 02:38:24,219
No, no, no, don't, don't, don't.

1648
02:38:24,219 --> 02:38:25,420
I don't want to get-

1649
02:38:27,649 --> 02:38:30,049
When was this last time you wanted to be written up?

1650
02:38:30,049 --> 02:38:31,170
You've been written up before, huh?

1651
02:38:32,049 --> 02:38:34,049
Once, but it was for something unrelated.

1652
02:38:34,049 --> 02:38:35,409
But you don't have to do that.

1653
02:38:35,409 --> 02:38:36,450
When do you want it done?

1654
02:38:36,450 --> 02:38:37,489
I'll get my colleague on it.

1655
02:38:37,489 --> 02:38:39,409
We'll make sure they get it cleaned.

1656
02:38:39,489 --> 02:38:41,250
Twenty more minutes.

1657
02:38:41,250 --> 02:38:41,809
Twenty minutes?

1658
02:38:41,809 --> 02:38:44,819
Or I will call your manager.

1659
02:38:44,819 --> 02:38:45,299
Twenty minutes?

1660
02:38:45,299 --> 02:38:46,260
No, that's uh-

1661
02:38:46,260 --> 02:38:47,940
Twenty minutes, that's enough time.

1662
02:38:47,940 --> 02:38:49,219
No, that's more than enough time.

1663
02:38:49,219 --> 02:38:49,719
Do it.

1664
02:38:50,739 --> 02:38:52,100
No, we'll get it on top of that.

1665
02:38:52,100 --> 02:38:53,219
We'll do it in twenty minutes.

1666
02:38:53,780 --> 02:38:56,020
Be gone, you little piece of-

1667
02:38:58,020 --> 02:38:58,500
Shitty-

1668
02:38:59,139 --> 02:39:02,059
Okay.

1669
02:39:03,200 --> 02:39:03,920
Yes, we will.

1670
02:39:05,979 --> 02:39:07,739
We will get it done in twenty minutes.

1671
02:39:11,840 --> 02:39:12,319
I'll try.

1672
02:39:12,959 --> 02:39:13,920
Hey, Jerma!

1673
02:39:14,399 --> 02:39:16,239
Hey, I need you up here.

1674
02:39:16,239 --> 02:39:20,000
I need you to get the job done quicker than we thought originally.

1675
02:39:21,840 --> 02:39:22,159
Okay.

1676
02:39:23,120 --> 02:39:24,959
Okay, well I'm fired up.

1677
02:39:24,959 --> 02:39:25,760
I'm ready to go.

1678
02:39:25,760 --> 02:39:27,440
I'm so excited to clean.

1679
02:39:27,440 --> 02:39:28,399
Yeah, no, for real though.

1680
02:39:28,399 --> 02:39:29,440
We have to get this done quickly

1681
02:39:29,440 --> 02:39:33,440
because our boss was going to write us up if we didn't.

1682
02:39:34,639 --> 02:39:35,520
Oh, what's-

1683
02:39:35,520 --> 02:39:36,159
Like, I quit.

1684
02:39:37,180 --> 02:39:37,680
What?

1685
02:39:38,219 --> 02:39:39,020
I quit.

1686
02:39:39,020 --> 02:39:39,579
What do you mean you quit?

1687
02:39:39,579 --> 02:39:40,620
What are you talking about?

1688
02:39:40,620 --> 02:39:43,899
I'm not going to get written up by that shithead.

1689
02:39:43,899 --> 02:39:44,459
No, dude.

1690
02:39:44,459 --> 02:39:46,700
That balding middle-aged piece of trash.

1691
02:39:46,700 --> 02:39:47,420
I don't think you understand.

1692
02:39:47,420 --> 02:39:48,540
Can't even please his wife.

1693
02:39:51,979 --> 02:39:53,739
I'm sorry that you don't get this.

1694
02:39:53,739 --> 02:39:55,899
Yeah, I saw his computer open the other day.

1695
02:39:55,899 --> 02:39:59,979
Like, the weirdest Craigslist wanted ads I've ever read.

1696
02:39:59,979 --> 02:40:02,139
Let's just turn on my stream.

1697
02:40:02,139 --> 02:40:02,940
Turn on my stream.

1698
02:40:02,940 --> 02:40:03,979
Turn on my stream for a second.

1699
02:40:03,979 --> 02:40:04,780
Turn on my stream for a second.

1700
02:40:04,780 --> 02:40:05,260
Important.

1701
02:40:05,260 --> 02:40:05,819
Turn on my stream.

1702
02:40:05,819 --> 02:40:06,299
Watch my stream.

1703
02:40:07,260 --> 02:40:09,739
We have to get this done in twenty minutes.

1704
02:40:10,459 --> 02:40:11,020
You know what I mean?

1705
02:40:11,020 --> 02:40:11,819
Like, we have to-

1706
02:40:11,819 --> 02:40:14,659
Like, uh-

1707
02:40:15,620 --> 02:40:16,100
Us.

1708
02:40:16,100 --> 02:40:16,500
Ghosts.

1709
02:40:16,500 --> 02:40:17,540
Um, I can't-

1710
02:40:17,540 --> 02:40:18,659
Twenty minutes, man.

1711
02:40:18,659 --> 02:40:19,620
Are you watching?

1712
02:40:19,620 --> 02:40:20,260
Twenty minutes.

1713
02:40:22,190 --> 02:40:22,909
Twenty minutes or-

1714
02:40:24,989 --> 02:40:25,549
I don't-

1715
02:40:25,549 --> 02:40:26,430
Like, I'm watching you.

1716
02:40:26,430 --> 02:40:29,229
Twenty minutes, we're gonna eat the farm.

1717
02:40:29,229 --> 02:40:30,430
We're gonna eat the farm in twenty minutes, dude.

1718
02:40:30,430 --> 02:40:31,549
Fucking just start cleaning now.

1719
02:40:32,270 --> 02:40:33,790
You're just the American psycho.

1720
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:47,280
He's gonna wipe your neck.

1721
02:40:54,620 --> 02:40:55,899
I didn't do the one finger.

1722
02:40:55,899 --> 02:40:57,340
I did, like, the whole palm.

1723
02:40:59,100 --> 02:41:00,379
He's gonna wipe your neck.

1724
02:41:00,379 --> 02:41:01,260
Oh, no, okay.

1725
02:41:01,260 --> 02:41:01,899
Hey, be careful.

1726
02:41:01,899 --> 02:41:02,299
He's gonna-

1727
02:41:02,299 --> 02:41:03,100
He's gonna go like-

1728
02:41:04,940 --> 02:41:07,579
You gotta get, like, some fucking fry oil on your chin.

1729
02:41:07,579 --> 02:41:08,379
He's gonna wipe off.

1730
02:41:09,739 --> 02:41:10,700
I'm okay with that.

1731
02:41:23,459 --> 02:41:25,219
Okay, so, uh, how do you wanna-

1732
02:41:25,219 --> 02:41:25,860
How do you wanna do this?

1733
02:41:28,020 --> 02:41:28,739
Dude, I don't-

1734
02:41:28,739 --> 02:41:29,620
I don't know.

1735
02:41:30,819 --> 02:41:31,940
What is left to do?

1736
02:41:31,940 --> 02:41:32,659
It's the attic.

1737
02:41:33,299 --> 02:41:34,420
The attic and then-

1738
02:41:34,420 --> 02:41:34,979
The USBs.

1739
02:41:34,979 --> 02:41:35,700
Give me the USBs.

1740
02:41:36,420 --> 02:41:38,270
Stop with this USB.

1741
02:41:38,270 --> 02:41:38,750
I quit.

1742
02:41:38,750 --> 02:41:39,389
I will quit.

1743
02:41:39,389 --> 02:41:40,590
Don't quit.

1744
02:41:40,590 --> 02:41:43,870
Get out here and come out the door with a pumpkin's fall.

1745
02:41:43,870 --> 02:41:45,469
I will destroy you.

1746
02:41:48,899 --> 02:41:50,180
Get out here.

1747
02:41:50,180 --> 02:41:51,940
Do one more USB joke and I am-

1748
02:41:51,940 --> 02:41:52,739
Get out of the-

1749
02:41:52,739 --> 02:41:54,979
Spreading my blood everywhere.

1750
02:41:54,979 --> 02:41:56,500
Get out of the house right now.

1751
02:41:56,500 --> 02:41:57,000
I'm out.

1752
02:41:58,110 --> 02:41:59,309
No, I mean, like, the other side.

1753
02:41:59,309 --> 02:42:00,350
The side with the pumpkin's fall.

1754
02:42:00,989 --> 02:42:05,629
Here, Mo.

1755
02:42:05,629 --> 02:42:06,190
Listen to me.

1756
02:42:06,190 --> 02:42:06,989
Listen to me real good.

1757
02:42:08,700 --> 02:42:13,340
I'm gonna cut myself open and just crawl along the floor.

1758
02:42:17,090 --> 02:42:18,530
Real sicko shit.

1759
02:42:18,530 --> 02:42:19,250
All right.

1760
02:42:19,250 --> 02:42:19,889
How about this?

1761
02:42:19,889 --> 02:42:20,450
I have-

1762
02:42:20,450 --> 02:42:21,489
I have a job for you, okay?

1763
02:42:22,739 --> 02:42:23,540
In this-

1764
02:42:23,540 --> 02:42:24,420
In this house somewhere.

1765
02:42:25,059 --> 02:42:25,459
Somewhere.

1766
02:42:26,180 --> 02:42:27,700
There's a fucking treasure.

1767
02:42:27,700 --> 02:42:29,139
And if you can find this tre-

1768
02:42:29,139 --> 02:42:31,790
If you can find the treasure in-

1769
02:42:33,899 --> 02:42:34,620
20 minutes.

1770
02:42:35,579 --> 02:42:36,139
Then-

1771
02:42:36,139 --> 02:42:36,860
No, less than that.

1772
02:42:37,500 --> 02:42:38,459
Five minutes.

1773
02:42:38,459 --> 02:42:40,219
Then I will give you-

1774
02:42:41,260 --> 02:42:42,540
I will give you a hundred dollars.

1775
02:42:43,500 --> 02:42:44,459
What is the treasure?

1776
02:42:45,020 --> 02:42:46,379
The USBs that I hid.

1777
02:42:47,260 --> 02:42:48,059
Okay.

1778
02:42:48,059 --> 02:42:50,540
Good luck.

1779
02:42:50,540 --> 02:42:51,420
And I have five minutes.

1780
02:42:51,420 --> 02:42:52,860
You have five minutes to make a hundred bucks.

1781
02:42:53,500 --> 02:42:54,350
Okay, chat.

1782
02:42:54,350 --> 02:42:54,909
Where do you put them?

1783
02:42:55,709 --> 02:42:56,350
You can't do that.

1784
02:42:56,350 --> 02:42:57,309
That doesn't work.

1785
02:42:57,309 --> 02:42:58,190
Okay, I can't do that.

1786
02:42:58,190 --> 02:42:59,069
Close your chat right now.

1787
02:42:59,969 --> 02:43:00,209
Okay.

1788
02:43:00,209 --> 02:43:00,770
That's bullshit.

1789
02:43:00,770 --> 02:43:01,649
You know, that's unbelievable.

1790
02:43:02,290 --> 02:43:02,770
He's cheating.

1791
02:43:03,409 --> 02:43:04,209
You have five minutes.

1792
02:43:04,209 --> 02:43:04,850
I'm counting right now.

1793
02:43:05,489 --> 02:43:07,299
I'm looking at the clock.

1794
02:43:25,200 --> 02:43:25,600
Found it.

1795
02:43:28,020 --> 02:43:29,780
That's one USB that's outside.

1796
02:43:29,780 --> 02:43:32,020
Not the, like, 40 that I hid.

1797
02:43:32,020 --> 02:43:33,700
Hundred bucks, please!

1798
02:43:33,700 --> 02:43:36,100
No, I said find the USBs that I hid.

1799
02:43:36,100 --> 02:43:37,459
Not find a USB on the clock.

1800
02:43:37,459 --> 02:43:38,819
You hid it right here.

1801
02:43:38,819 --> 02:43:41,459
No, this is not like an Easter egg hunt for four-year-olds.

1802
02:43:41,459 --> 02:43:41,780
This is-

1803
02:43:42,739 --> 02:43:43,860
No, it's going to be harder than that.

1804
02:43:44,500 --> 02:43:44,819
They don't-

1805
02:43:44,819 --> 02:43:46,340
It wasn't harder than that, though.

1806
02:43:46,340 --> 02:43:47,219
It was right here.

1807
02:43:47,219 --> 02:43:49,139
You thought, like, I would see it in the grass because it's green.

1808
02:43:50,909 --> 02:43:52,110
You only have three more minutes left.

1809
02:43:53,280 --> 02:43:55,360
That is not how quickly time goes by.

1810
02:43:55,360 --> 02:43:55,920
Yes, it is.

1811
02:43:56,639 --> 02:44:03,219
Nothing in there.

1812
02:44:04,979 --> 02:44:05,479
Fuck!

1813
02:44:08,430 --> 02:44:11,729
You'll never catch that money!

1814
02:44:11,729 --> 02:44:12,610
You'll never catch that money!

1815
02:44:14,299 --> 02:44:22,620
What are you going to spend your hundred dollars on?

1816
02:44:22,620 --> 02:44:23,819
You read that.

1817
02:44:23,819 --> 02:44:24,459
You read that.

1818
02:44:25,420 --> 02:44:29,620
All right, well, can you pick those up?

1819
02:44:30,340 --> 02:44:30,840
Hello?

1820
02:44:32,659 --> 02:44:33,219
Can I-

1821
02:44:33,219 --> 02:44:34,100
I don't know where they go.

1822
02:44:36,340 --> 02:44:38,500
They were in one central location.

1823
02:44:44,659 --> 02:44:46,420
Why is there another body in here?

1824
02:44:47,139 --> 02:44:49,110
I don't understand how this is-

1825
02:44:49,110 --> 02:44:50,000
Was he in the attic?

1826
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:50,799
Hey, Dharma.

1827
02:44:50,799 --> 02:44:51,299
Yes?

1828
02:44:54,719 --> 02:44:58,319
How about I hide the USBs and then you have to go find them?

1829
02:44:58,319 --> 02:44:59,680
Okay, that sounds fun.

1830
02:44:59,680 --> 02:45:00,719
And then it'll be even.

1831
02:45:01,200 --> 02:45:01,700
Sure.

1832
02:45:02,399 --> 02:45:02,899
Okay.

1833
02:45:03,360 --> 02:45:04,319
I want to clarify.

1834
02:45:04,959 --> 02:45:08,799
To find them, you, like, need to, like, pick them up and hold them

1835
02:45:08,799 --> 02:45:10,319
and prove to me that you found them.

1836
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:15,569
Yeah, where's- you can just- I have a stream going right now.

1837
02:45:16,610 --> 02:45:17,170
Yeah, you do.

1838
02:45:18,559 --> 02:45:21,360
You're gonna have to prove to your stream by holding one of the USBs

1839
02:45:21,360 --> 02:45:23,200
that you find the USBs that I hid.

1840
02:45:23,200 --> 02:45:23,700
Okay.

1841
02:45:25,200 --> 02:45:25,700
Just one.

1842
02:45:26,399 --> 02:45:28,840
Or do I have to find them all?

1843
02:45:29,569 --> 02:45:31,889
You have to find- like, I'm hiding the stash.

1844
02:45:32,450 --> 02:45:32,950
Okay.

1845
02:45:33,780 --> 02:45:37,059
So as long as I find the stash that's in quotes.

1846
02:45:37,059 --> 02:45:37,559
Yeah.

1847
02:45:37,780 --> 02:45:40,260
Yeah, and you can prove that you found it by, like,

1848
02:45:40,260 --> 02:45:42,659
picking it up and showing I have found it.

1849
02:45:42,659 --> 02:45:44,559
Okay.

1850
02:45:44,559 --> 02:45:45,760
Yeah, whatever.

1851
02:45:45,760 --> 02:45:47,120
Like, I'm going to hide or something?

1852
02:45:47,120 --> 02:45:47,760
Do I want me to go-

1853
02:45:47,760 --> 02:45:49,280
You need to- you know what?

1854
02:45:49,280 --> 02:45:50,479
Oh, it's clown on the town list.

1855
02:45:50,479 --> 02:45:52,399
You turn around and count to 15.

1856
02:45:52,399 --> 02:45:52,899
Okay.

1857
02:45:53,940 --> 02:45:54,979
Are you ready?

1858
02:45:54,979 --> 02:45:55,479
Yep.

1859
02:45:56,579 --> 02:45:57,079
One.

1860
02:45:57,540 --> 02:45:58,040
Two.

1861
02:45:58,500 --> 02:45:59,000
Three.

1862
02:45:59,540 --> 02:46:00,040
Four.

1863
02:46:00,680 --> 02:46:01,180
Five.

1864
02:46:01,719 --> 02:46:02,219
Six.

1865
02:46:02,680 --> 02:46:03,180
Seven.

1866
02:46:03,719 --> 02:46:04,219
Eight.

1867
02:46:04,840 --> 02:46:05,340
Nine.

1868
02:46:05,879 --> 02:46:06,379
Ten.

1869
02:46:06,680 --> 02:46:07,180
Eleven.

1870
02:46:07,719 --> 02:46:08,219
Twelve.

1871
02:46:08,840 --> 02:46:09,340
Thirteen.

1872
02:46:09,959 --> 02:46:10,459
Fourteen.

1873
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:11,500
Fifteen.

1874
02:46:16,450 --> 02:46:16,950
And?

1875
02:46:17,409 --> 02:46:20,280
Good luck.

1876
02:46:20,280 --> 02:46:21,799
You didn't even walk over here.

1877
02:46:23,430 --> 02:46:23,930
I hid them.

1878
02:46:24,469 --> 02:46:39,219
Hold on.

1879
02:46:39,219 --> 02:46:40,159
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, no.

1880
02:46:40,159 --> 02:46:40,959
Nobody move.

1881
02:46:40,959 --> 02:46:41,920
Nobody fucking move.

1882
02:46:47,920 --> 02:46:48,420
Give me one!

1883
02:46:49,040 --> 02:46:49,540
Is it in there?

1884
02:46:50,559 --> 02:46:51,520
It's the stash!

1885
02:46:51,520 --> 02:46:52,239
That's the stash!

1886
02:46:53,639 --> 02:46:54,139
Come on!

1887
02:46:54,600 --> 02:46:55,959
Some one of them had to have fallen off.

1888
02:47:02,340 --> 02:47:02,840
No!

1889
02:47:03,299 --> 02:47:05,459
At least one didn't make the journey.

1890
02:47:07,510 --> 02:47:10,319
Oh, god damn it.

1891
02:47:11,040 --> 02:47:15,379
That was so sad.

1892
02:47:15,379 --> 02:47:15,879
What just happened?

1893
02:47:17,590 --> 02:47:18,090
Okay, so-

1894
02:47:18,090 --> 02:47:18,590
Okay.

1895
02:47:19,030 --> 02:47:20,479
So that's 200.

1896
02:47:21,700 --> 02:47:23,139
There was no monetary bet there.

1897
02:47:46,520 --> 02:47:47,719
As reliable as ever.

1898
02:47:49,239 --> 02:47:52,000
Good old Jerma.

1899
02:47:52,639 --> 02:47:59,340
Hey, Star.

1900
02:48:00,120 --> 02:48:00,620
Yeah?

1901
02:48:00,680 --> 02:48:05,510
Found something.

1902
02:48:05,510 --> 02:48:06,790
That's not a stash.

1903
02:48:07,430 --> 02:48:08,469
There are three here.

1904
02:48:11,270 --> 02:48:15,909
There are three that fell from some portal and made their way in here.

1905
02:48:16,850 --> 02:48:17,729
That's a stash.

1906
02:48:17,729 --> 02:48:20,129
I just put them here so that you wouldn't destroy them.

1907
02:48:20,129 --> 02:48:21,010
Hey, come over this way.

1908
02:48:21,010 --> 02:48:21,729
Hey, come over here.

1909
02:48:21,729 --> 02:48:23,649
That is classified as a stash.

1910
02:48:24,370 --> 02:48:25,010
Over here.

1911
02:48:25,010 --> 02:48:28,370
There's also a stash, but it was the stash.

1912
02:48:28,370 --> 02:48:28,870
Jerma.

1913
02:48:29,750 --> 02:48:35,110
Why am I doing that?

1914
02:48:35,110 --> 02:48:35,590
We need those.

1915
02:48:35,590 --> 02:48:36,090
All right.

1916
02:48:36,469 --> 02:48:37,829
I swear to god.

1917
02:48:38,389 --> 02:48:41,579
Okay, so, um, let's finish up.

1918
02:48:42,379 --> 02:48:43,260
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1919
02:48:43,260 --> 02:48:44,860
You've ruined everything.

1920
02:48:44,860 --> 02:48:45,659
You've put-

1921
02:48:49,209 --> 02:48:50,329
You won't stare at this cat.

1922
02:48:51,370 --> 02:48:52,889
This is like a fucking haunted image.

1923
02:48:52,889 --> 02:48:54,889
If you stare at this picture for more than a minute,

1924
02:48:55,530 --> 02:48:56,969
you get haunted for the rest of your life.

1925
02:48:57,930 --> 02:48:58,569
You won't do it.

1926
02:48:59,370 --> 02:49:01,450
Holy shit.

1927
02:49:01,450 --> 02:49:03,930
You're just disrespecting the fucking cat.

1928
02:49:05,780 --> 02:49:06,100
Do it!

1929
02:49:06,100 --> 02:49:06,659
No, no, do it!

1930
02:49:06,659 --> 02:49:07,159
Do it!

1931
02:49:07,799 --> 02:49:10,040
If you stare at a black cat for more than a minute,

1932
02:49:11,639 --> 02:49:13,639
you get bad luck for like five years.

1933
02:49:13,639 --> 02:49:14,200
Will you do it?

1934
02:49:14,200 --> 02:49:14,700
Do it.

1935
02:49:16,090 --> 02:49:16,969
Candyman.

1936
02:49:16,969 --> 02:49:17,530
Candyman.

1937
02:49:17,530 --> 02:49:18,010
Don't do that.

1938
02:49:18,010 --> 02:49:18,809
Don't do that.

1939
02:49:18,809 --> 02:49:19,450
I don't want you to do that.

1940
02:49:20,010 --> 02:49:22,250
I'm not in the same room, therefore I'm not in the same zone.

1941
02:49:25,950 --> 02:49:27,549
Whatever you do, I'm not in that room.

1942
02:49:28,190 --> 02:49:37,469
But I'm looking at it too.

1943
02:49:50,250 --> 02:49:57,690
I can't believe you actually looked at it.

1944
02:49:59,420 --> 02:50:00,219
That was a mistake.

1945
02:50:01,280 --> 02:50:02,239
Shouldn't have done that.

1946
02:50:08,940 --> 02:50:09,659
Are we still on call?

1947
02:50:12,600 --> 02:50:13,719
No, he didn't do the thing.

1948
02:50:13,719 --> 02:50:14,600
He just leaves, right?

1949
02:50:15,399 --> 02:50:16,969
Did he leave?

1950
02:50:20,170 --> 02:50:21,049
He left.

1951
02:50:21,049 --> 02:50:21,610
No, he didn't.

1952
02:50:22,250 --> 02:50:23,479
He's here.

1953
02:50:24,860 --> 02:50:25,579
You can't fool me.

1954
02:50:25,579 --> 02:50:25,979
You're here.

1955
02:50:28,059 --> 02:50:29,180
You can't fool me.

1956
02:50:29,180 --> 02:50:29,739
You're there.

1957
02:50:29,739 --> 02:50:30,379
I know you're there.

1958
02:50:30,940 --> 02:50:31,659
He's gone.

1959
02:50:31,659 --> 02:50:32,540
He ended his stream too.

1960
02:50:43,399 --> 02:50:44,040
God damn it.

1961
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,479
I gave him an out and he took the opportunity.

1962
02:50:47,479 --> 02:50:50,680
He was looking for an opportunity and he found it.

1963
02:50:58,399 --> 02:51:01,040
I should have told him, like, look at it for four hours.

1964
02:51:01,760 --> 02:51:06,110
Well, that was fun.

1965
02:51:07,069 --> 02:51:09,149
That was Star on Twitch.

1966
02:51:09,870 --> 02:51:12,110
He's still streaming.

1967
02:51:12,110 --> 02:51:12,989
He's still streaming.

1968
02:51:13,709 --> 02:51:17,399
What is he doing right now?

1969
02:51:17,399 --> 02:51:26,120
He's offline.

1970
02:51:26,120 --> 02:51:31,159
All right, well, it's supposed to be co-op day.

1971
02:51:31,879 --> 02:51:36,909
I'm like Matrix dodging bullets here.

1972
02:51:38,090 --> 02:51:39,799
Internet sucks.

1973
02:51:39,799 --> 02:51:41,319
Executive assault 2 doesn't work.

1974
02:51:42,120 --> 02:51:44,200
Star looked at the cat picture for more than a minute.

1975
02:51:44,760 --> 02:51:46,159
That's three strikes.

1976
02:51:46,879 --> 02:51:48,489
Time to do tier lists.

1977
02:51:58,590 --> 02:52:01,049
All right, let me just take a break.

1978
02:52:01,530 --> 02:52:03,850
I've been live for about four hours now.

1979
02:52:04,729 --> 02:52:05,760
Maybe more than that.

1980
02:52:05,760 --> 02:52:07,200
The stream turned off like three times.

1981
02:52:08,780 --> 02:52:10,299
I have no idea how long I've been live for.

1982
02:52:10,299 --> 02:52:11,739
It's been probably four or five hours or so.

1983
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:16,840
But we'll come back.

1984
02:52:16,840 --> 02:52:17,719
We'll do the tier lists.

1985
02:52:22,680 --> 02:52:24,920
And I'll see you in not even three.

1986
02:52:24,920 --> 02:52:27,879
No, the stream turned off like three times.

1987
02:52:30,040 --> 02:52:31,479
How long has it actually been?

1988
02:52:31,479 --> 02:52:42,639
Let me see.

1989
02:52:50,559 --> 02:52:51,520
25 minutes.

1990
02:52:55,159 --> 02:52:55,639
No, let's see.

1991
02:52:55,639 --> 02:52:57,000
How many VODs are there in this stream?

1992
02:52:58,190 --> 02:52:58,670
No, let's see.

1993
02:52:58,670 --> 02:52:59,870
How many VODs are there in this stream?

1994
02:52:59,870 --> 02:53:00,430
Oh, yeah.

1995
02:53:00,430 --> 02:53:02,829
This has been much longer than that.

1996
02:53:02,829 --> 02:53:03,229
Oh, yeah.

1997
02:53:03,229 --> 02:53:04,590
No, this is 20.

1998
02:53:04,590 --> 02:53:05,389
One hour 30.

1999
02:53:05,389 --> 02:53:06,190
Oh, yeah.

2000
02:53:06,190 --> 02:53:07,629
No, this is four hours.

2001
02:53:07,629 --> 02:53:08,750
One hour 30.

2002
02:53:08,750 --> 02:53:10,670
Four hours.

2003
02:53:10,670 --> 02:53:11,870
One hour 30.

2004
02:53:11,870 --> 02:53:12,909
Four hours.

2005
02:53:12,909 --> 02:53:14,909
One hour 30.

2006
02:53:14,909 --> 02:53:16,110
Four hours.

2007
02:53:16,110 --> 02:53:17,389
Star just hosted me.

2008
02:53:17,389 --> 02:53:18,909
Four hours.

2009
02:53:18,909 --> 02:53:19,870
Thank you for that, Star.

2010
02:53:19,870 --> 02:53:20,590
Star just hosted me.

2011
02:53:22,590 --> 02:53:22,989
Oops.

2012
02:53:23,629 --> 02:53:25,389
Oops, oops, whoops.

2013
02:53:28,059 --> 02:53:28,459
Whoops.

2014
02:53:32,940 --> 02:53:33,979
How do I actually turn this up?

2015
02:53:35,920 --> 02:53:37,120
How do I actually turn this up?

2016
02:53:37,120 --> 02:53:37,840
Why is this playing?

2017
02:53:37,840 --> 02:53:38,639
I don't have one window.

2018
02:53:38,639 --> 02:53:39,280
I actually don't have one window.

2019
02:53:39,280 --> 02:53:40,159
How do I actually turn this up?

2020
02:53:40,159 --> 02:53:40,879
Why is this playing?

2021
02:53:40,879 --> 02:53:41,680
I don't have one window.

2022
02:53:41,680 --> 02:53:42,399
I actually don't have one window.

2023
02:53:42,399 --> 02:53:43,200
How do I actually turn this up?

2024
02:53:43,200 --> 02:53:44,559
I'm going to turn, I'm going to turn my light.

2025
02:53:45,360 --> 02:53:47,040
I'm going to turn my capture screen on.

2026
02:53:48,399 --> 02:53:50,079
I'm going to turn my capture screen on.

2027
02:53:51,440 --> 02:53:53,120
I'm going to turn my capture screen on.

2028
02:53:54,559 --> 02:53:56,159
I'm going to turn my capture screen on.

2029
02:54:18,139 --> 02:54:18,940
Oh, there it is.

2030
02:54:19,579 --> 02:54:21,819
Okay, I was on a different, I was on my videos tab

2031
02:54:22,969 --> 02:54:24,729
and it was still playing the stream

2032
02:54:24,729 --> 02:54:26,729
even though I was on the videos tab somehow.

2033
02:54:28,920 --> 02:54:32,799
Okay, I'll be right back.

2034
02:54:32,799 --> 02:54:34,319
I'm going to just go to the bathroom

2035
02:54:34,319 --> 02:54:35,360
and we'll do some stuff.

2036
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:37,389
See you soon.
