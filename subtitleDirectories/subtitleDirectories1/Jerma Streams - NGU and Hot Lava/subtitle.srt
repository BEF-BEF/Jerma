00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:19,769
Hello, how are you? Good afternoon. Stream will be idling soon. Maybe, possibly. We do have a few

2
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:30,469
options. I just saw this come out on Steam and needed to play it. I just want to see what's in

3
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:39,820
it. I have a pretty addictive personality and if something's fun, sometimes I want to do it more

4
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:51,189
than once, more than twice. The game we're going to play today is called NGU Idle. It's called

5
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:58,570
Numbers Go Up. And the whole point of the game is for numbers to increase in value. That's it.

6
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:06,810
There's nothing else in this game. So I have a backup in case this is not fun. All right,

7
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:12,170
there's two things that will happen. The stream's been live for a minute and a half. Here we go.

8
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:26,709
We will either play this for 30 minutes or 16 straight hours. We may also play this for

9
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:38,579
30 minutes and then move on to the floor is lava game. I don't know. I have no plan today. Don't

10
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:45,430
do it. I just made that up. I pretended like somebody said don't do it. What's the... No,

11
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:52,500
no. It's actually the floor is lava. The name of the game is called like Lava Floor. Right? What's

12
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:59,079
it called? What's the name of the game? What is the name of that game? A Hot Lava is the name of

13
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:08,419
the game actually. It's a parkour game where you can't touch the floor because of course the floor

14
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:18,650
is made out of lava. But we aren't going to do that yet. I've got a number game to get addicted

15
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:30,460
to first. Is this pre-recorded? Why would this be a pre-recorded stream? I would pick the numbers

16
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,419
go upstream to be pre-recorded. I mean, I guess that would make some sense now that I think about

17
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:42,150
it. It is just going to be us watching a screen with numbers going up in succession. But there's

18
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:51,740
RPG elements in this game. I guess. I've tried it. I opened it to just so I... I didn't want to be

19
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:56,379
the idiot that has no idea what he's doing. And yes, whoa, it's easy. You just watch numbers go

20
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:02,120
up. This is way more involved, I believe. I'll show it to you right now just so you can see.

21
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:15,289
Just so you completely understand. But there apparently there's like a jackass disclaimer.

22
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:20,759
I'm gonna assume this says like take a break every seven hours or something, right?

23
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:31,270
It has to be. It's gonna be like a Wiimote take a break thing. Somebody just give $50.

24
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:42,860
That's 5,000 bits from Phylactery Lich. Phylactery is back with another 5,000 bits. Can't wait to

25
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:49,210
watch my favorite streamers numbers go up. Now give me some box steps. The two completely different

26
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:55,639
streams the last... Yesterday we did a bunch of crazy shit in Hitman. Today, if you got a book

27
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:00,759
report to do, you know, just just to have it in the background. If you've got some work to do,

28
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:06,169
we can all just pretend we're playing this together because you could like go to sleep

29
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:12,949
if you want to. I know that like business management 101, I would get grabbed and like

30
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:16,389
an earpiece would be in my ear or something that says don't fucking tell your audience just to like

31
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:25,220
leave or sleep on stream. Well, I didn't tell you to leave. I told you to stay and study

32
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,980
because you have a book report due tomorrow. I saw somebody in the pre-stream chat.

33
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:33,670
They need it. They were like, I got this paper that's almost done. Do it now. Look what right now

34
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:41,379
with us. Well, I'm not going to do your paper for you, but do it now. It's a babysitting stream.

35
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:50,069
All right. If you've got... No, that's not right. Nevermind. Stop reminding me. All right. Let's

36
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:56,259
read this. It says whoomph. As you come to the first thing you notice the taste of copper in

37
00:04:56,259 --> 00:05:04,779
your mouth. Why is it always that? Even a game like Portal had that. Remember when you walk through

38
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:08,779
the first thing, it's like, oh, the taste of iron and copper in your mouth is normal. It's always

39
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:17,819
like some metal that's in your mouth. The second being the stench of raw sewage all around you.

40
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:25,959
You get up nursing your busted lip and rubbing your head, which feels like it was lovingly caressed

41
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:32,970
by a concrete block. You try to remember how you got to, well, whatever this place is. You realize

42
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,959
with a surprising lack of panic that you've forgotten who you are. Based on the state you're

43
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:45,399
in right now, you're thinking they must have been an asshole. I love the writing in this.

44
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:55,209
That's such a great sentence. Tossed in a gross pit of sewage. At least for the short term,

45
00:05:55,209 --> 00:06:00,250
you have an objective. Finding a way out of here. It kind of feels like the right thing to do. You

46
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,819
try to stand up, but your knees are weak. They shake, they buckle, and you fall back down.

47
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:09,860
It's only now that you feel the weakness in your body. Not any normal sort of weakness,

48
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,459
like when you stand up too quickly and get lightheaded or have your arm ripped off in

49
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:19,449
an industrial accident. No, you feel like something has sapped away the majority of your strength.

50
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:23,290
Well, there's nothing to do but to try to regain some of that strength and to get out of here.

51
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:34,759
Maybe hitting a big white button named play will let you do something fun.

52
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:48,709
All right, here we go. Fun is relative, I believe. But this is, uh, wait, has this been,

53
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:58,569
have this, this has just been on for an hour and 23 minutes because I was sitting at that screen.

54
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:02,939
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is, this is not right. This is incorrect. This is incorrect.

55
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:10,569
I have to restart it. We should do a new game. That new game. It was sitting at that press play

56
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:21,110
screen for an hour and 23 minutes, apparently. All right, whatever. We're good. I'll start a new game.

57
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:30,699
So I was ready for a total time played one hour and 23 minutes. No, this is, I was like eating

58
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:35,910
food and like getting the stream ready and like taking a shit. This is how long it takes for me

59
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:40,899
to start a stream, guys. That's an hour and 23 minutes. So I got everything ready and I was like,

60
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:44,579
all right, I've got to take shit. All right, that's 25 minutes. I got to take a shower. That's like

61
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:49,220
15, 20 minutes. I got to eat food. That's like 30 foot. Yeah. That's how long this is exactly how

62
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:57,819
long it takes for me to start a live stream after like getting up in the morning. 25 minutes. Shit.

63
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:05,259
Yeah. What are you talking about? I don't buy this for a second that some of you guys take.

64
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:11,910
I'm not 20 minutes, 15 minutes. I don't know. 10 minutes, 15 minutes. It depends on what I'm

65
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:16,360
reading on my iPhone. Look, if there's like a big thing on Twitter that I'm looking at,

66
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:23,209
I'm going to be there. It takes two minutes to take a shit. Holy fuck. What are you talking about?

67
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:27,959
How long does it take you to wipe your ass? It takes five minutes to wipe your ass.

68
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:35,830
Two minutes? You are a liar if you think that you can tell me right now that you wipe your

69
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:40,149
ass in less than five minutes. Nope. I don't believe you. And if you do that and that's

70
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:49,370
actually true, I don't know if that's totally, I don't know if it's totally clean or not.

71
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,210
Like a three minute ass wiping. All right. So first of all, that's all I need to say.

72
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:03,700
That's funny though. That actually is funny. That's how long it takes. Okay. Start a new game.

73
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:19,590
Oh, you come too. This guy has swamp ass. No, I want a clean body. Completely void of all filth.

74
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:26,980
All right. We're done. It took me two minutes to say that. Did it take me two minutes to do that?

75
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:34,809
No, it didn't. How long has Stream been live for? 10 minutes. What? We've been live for like three.

76
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:42,870
Oh God. All right. Hey there, whoever you are. Glad you decided to check out NGU. I'm something

77
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:47,590
of a game developer myself. The guy who made this game. People call me 4G for short. That's all

78
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:51,590
right. That's cool. I see the something. And then we had a ton more money just came in. What's

79
00:09:51,590 --> 00:10:02,389
going on? Why are you guys giving so much money right now? Uh, La Crona gave 5,000 bits twice.

80
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:09,980
They gave, uh, 10,000 bits. Derma step up your shitting game, spread your ass cheeks. I don't

81
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:20,200
think I can read this. Your asshole. No, no, everybody has their own way to do that.

82
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:26,789
Everyone. If you talk to anybody and I am going to get a little gross. Okay.

83
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,289
No, I'm not. This is going to be, we're going to be PG for this one. They write books for kids

84
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:41,179
on this shit guys. Don't worry when you, but two different, two different people don't go to the

85
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:51,639
bathroom. Same way. Everybody has their own bathroom ritual. All of us. It's like built into

86
00:10:51,639 --> 00:11:00,789
the DNA of humans. Some people, you know, they, they prep, they prep for like five minutes. They

87
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:06,730
just sit there. They prep. They did the prep work. Some people need to drink a coffee in the morning

88
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:11,129
to get themselves or water to get themselves going. That's prep work. That's included in the

89
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:24,700
ship time. There's also post work too. I stretch after I go to the second one because I want to

90
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,379
make sure everything's all, you know, the urine testings need to be kind of nice and moved around

91
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:37,159
jog in place for a minute, shake around. I stretch after I, what are you talking about?

92
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:57,860
What do you mean stop? What are you talking about? I'm talking about like I get up and like do like

93
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:11,139
touch my toes. I'm not doing these exercises in the bathroom. What is, what are you just talking

94
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:20,470
about? Somebody's gave another $5,000, but they say pee pee poo poo. That was bala koala for

95
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:29,340
5,000 bits. Wait, I hold on. Let me, I want to make this really, really, really completely

96
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:36,820
totally clear. I can't talk about my post shit activity, but I can get messages spammed here in

97
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:42,460
this chat room that says pee pee poo poo like he pooped his pants. There's a, I think there's a,

98
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:50,820
that's an issue. I think a bit. We put an image on screen yesterday of everybody laughing their

99
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:56,679
asses off it. A fake of me pissing my pants, but this is weird for me to talk about how I stretch

100
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:12,090
after I go to the bathroom. I gotta, I gotta restart. Do I have to restart? Debunk. No. All

101
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:15,929
right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This, this, I have like a, I'm flying like an airplane right

102
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:21,980
now. Like, hold on. What the fuck do I do? I love how that's like a message. All right. Well,

103
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:28,679
I'm just going to go. I got five, this is energy. Okay. You need energy. Fuck the tutorial gives

104
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:40,299
a shit. I know what to do. So we've got 500 energy with this. This increases each moment.

105
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:45,669
You can fight people. We have to, we have a thousand HP, a hundred attack, a hundred defense.

106
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,350
And we, uh, current rebirth time is six minutes and 26 seconds.

107
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:54,409
Auto save in seven seconds to make sure just in case something happens, you know, in case

108
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:58,570
you sit in there for too long and you got to get up and do some prep work before you use the bathroom

109
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:04,759
and then obviously do some stretching afterwards, get out of here. So basic training, we have idle

110
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:09,850
attack and idle block. We can't do these ones yet. And I mean, what do you say we turn on a little

111
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,690
bit of an OST here? My favorite OST in the world. We're talking about the turtles and time soundtrack.

112
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:27,299
Let's get it going. I have 250 energy. Let's just spam attack. Look at my attack going out.

113
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:36,779
That's a number rising increasingly. That's the whole thing. There's no other songs.

114
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:47,850
Numbers go up. This is going to get much more interesting. Maybe, maybe I have not figured that

115
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:53,720
out yet. I was going to play it, but what do I, I can't just go all attack. I gotta go defense too.

116
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:59,080
This is HP. There we go. Look at that 1200, 1300, 1415. Let's just put all 500 in here.

117
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:07,269
So I have a 500 cap of energy. By the way, for every resident sleeper that I see in the chat,

118
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:23,740
it adds one minute to how long we're going to play this. I'm tracking them too. That's at least 280

119
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,220
minutes. The shit, this is the best song. This is the best song in the whole, the best song

120
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:42,710
of the whole soundtrack. Levels gained to this defense skill will decrease the amount of energy

121
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:47,269
needed to cap leveling speed upon rebirth. So rebirth is you, you prestige like Call of Duty.

122
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:59,700
Call of Duty stole everything they know from NGU. All right, I almost have a million HP. All right,

123
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:06,580
I have 626 block points. Look at the millions of HP. All right, we're going to do 250, 250.

124
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:17,419
Fight the boss. Here we go. Why am I hurt? Why am I already injured? How much HP do I have?

125
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:30,740
How did I get hurt? Why am I getting hurt? What's hurting me? Wait, I need to read this. You

126
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,379
shakily get to your feet, leaning against the wall for support. You have to build up your strength

127
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:39,620
somehow. From the corner of your eye, you spot a small piece of fluff. This will be your first and

128
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:46,179
most intense battle of your life. 50,000 attack. I got a million. I got a million. Get out of here.

129
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:51,139
Oh, you squished the fluff. In more important news, that's a fantastic sandwich.

130
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:54,500
Smoked ham and turkey with swiss cheese and honey dijon. That's a pretty good sandwich.

131
00:16:55,379 --> 00:17:00,100
Oh, hey, cool. You squished the fluff. In more important news, this is a fantastic sandwich.

132
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:04,819
Smoked ham and turkey with swiss cheese and honey dijon sauce on a ciabatta bun.

133
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:12,410
That's really fucking good. I'm actually kind of jealous about that. All right.

134
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:16,779
Uh, cool. Killing bosses brings a few important rewards. First off, you gain...

135
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm getting vroomed by the LST. First of all, you gain experience. Experience points.

136
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:32,710
Turn that down for just a second. Just turn it down a little. Okay, you gain experience points

137
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:37,589
for downing bosses. EXP is used to buy permanent powers in the spend EXP menu,

138
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:41,349
which also you just unlocked. You should see a fancy yellow button in the bottom left.

139
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:48,500
Right there. Okay. Uh, all right. Uh, there's a lot of stuff you can buy with the EXP,

140
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,740
but don't get overwhelmed. My pro tip to you would be to buy the special offers to increase

141
00:17:52,740 --> 00:18:00,460
the energy... I'm gonna burp. My pro tip to you would be to buy the special offers to increase

142
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:05,980
the speed the energy bar fills. I did specifically code them for newbies like you to buy, but no

143
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,619
pressure. Defeat the next couple bosses and I'll bug you again. 4G over and up. You got it.

144
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:21,859
Oh lord. All right. Total energy speed. Buying this will make the energy bar fill up faster,

145
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:32,710
which is this. Max speed is one bar fill per tick or 50 fills a second. Note, the bar fills

146
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:41,690
at a rate of 50 divided by energy speed. Ticks per fill rounded up. Later on, you'll want to

147
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:49,740
buy this upgrade in chunks such as 25 equals is greater than 50 speed in order to gain any effect.

148
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,779
All right. Newbie offers. That's what I'm looking for. What I got? Two experience

149
00:18:55,819 --> 00:19:06,200
plus 0.3 for two experience points. Let's do it. Look at that. Max energy on... Max energy

150
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:16,619
on this rebirth is capped at 500. On rebirth, you will have 529 energy. All righty. Look

151
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:22,329
at how much fucking HP I have. Okay. I'm going to breeze through the newbie zones. All right.

152
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:26,410
Your current energy speed is 1.3, meaning the bar fills every 39 ticks. Next speed increases at

153
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:32,150
1.3 energy speed. Tap R to reclaim energy for a moment. Okay. Let's go. Oh yeah. Look at this.

154
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:37,930
I'm just completely allocating. Let's go kick some ass. Boss fight. Floating piece of shit.

155
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:43,990
You're sure that it's a fluff could... If the fluff could it... If the fluff could, comma,

156
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:48,299
it would give a dramatic death speech, but alas, you kick it off to the side.

157
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:53,130
More confident in your strength. What other inanimate objects are there to murder? A piece

158
00:19:53,130 --> 00:20:00,119
of sewage as if my cube begins floating down the water right in front of you. Get fucking

159
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:12,339
instakilled. Boss fight. A stick. The sewage retreats from your onslaught of attacks. Either

160
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:16,019
that or it kept floating by. Probably your attacks though. You feel like you can manage

161
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:21,210
to make your way out of here now, but a weapon would be handy. Oh hey, is that a stick coming

162
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:32,009
down the water? Instakill it please. Oh, wait a minute. All right. A small mouse. As you turn

163
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:37,019
to head, as you turn to head to this room's exit, you notice a brown little mouse. In a

164
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:47,140
shrill voice, it squeaks. Welcome to NGU Idol. I'm Tippy. If you're all right, Ed. Eddie. If

165
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:52,700
you're all right, Ed. Oh, I don't think we can do that, Eddie. Turning out this annoying mouse's

166
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:59,640
intro, you're hit with a jolt of memory. I need to defeat every foe in your path. No matter what.

167
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,599
You can start with this mouse right here. What's he got? 11 million HP. I got 25 million. You got

168
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:16,740
nothing on me. Attack 1.1 million. Defense 3.1. Let's go. See you later. Oh, hi. Hello. It's 4G

169
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:21,400
again. So you killed the mouse. I guess that means it's time to add some rockin' new gameplay your

170
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:28,220
way. First off, you unlocked Adventure. Think crappy RPG within the game. You'll fight stuff

171
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:33,930
and loot other stuff. The training skills you unlock become moves you can use in Adventure to

172
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:39,849
defeat enemies. Oh, shit. What do you know about that? Enemies will spawn randomly every few

173
00:21:39,849 --> 00:21:44,009
seconds when you move out of the safe zone. Fighting enemies in Adventure will drop gear,

174
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:47,829
which you can equip in the snazzy new... By the way, this game's free. I need to make that very

175
00:21:47,829 --> 00:21:54,009
clear. You can just go get it right now on Steam. Or play it on a congregate, I believe. You just

176
00:21:54,009 --> 00:22:00,329
play it. Fucking free. Who knows if they make you buy stuff. I don't know. Somebody just said

177
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:14,089
It Better Be. What? Come on. This is fucking... This is a classic. This is a classic game,

178
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:20,140
and I am offended that you just said that. This game's been around for like five years.

179
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:25,450
It's back before you even... That's back before you even were born. You were in diapers when this

180
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:30,490
guy 4G was making this shit. Like 15 years ago when he rode it on the back of a napkin.

181
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:40,680
This is vintage. All hand-drawn. All right. Enemies... They drop gear. There's gear in this

182
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:46,950
game. There's hats in this game. That just made everybody like it. All right. You have a new...

183
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:51,480
It's an inventory slot now. You don't have shit we're gonna have to take care of. Equipment can

184
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,759
boost your stats in Adventure and your main attack defense stats and later provide special

185
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:02,039
awesome bonuses. You only have the training zone unlocked. Defeating higher numbered bosses will

186
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:07,079
eventually unlock new Adventure zones to play in and get better gear to slap on. Also, boss enemies

187
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:11,880
in Adventure have a chance to drop experience. Experience is good. You've also unlocked rebirths,

188
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:17,420
which needs some explanation. I already know what this does because I sat there for an hour and a

189
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:27,130
half. Streamer in chat. Eventually you're going to hit a point... By the way, I'm sorry. I want to

190
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:33,740
count how many resident sleepers there were. There were exactly 1412. So that's 1412 minutes

191
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:43,240
added to the stream. Divided by 40. So it was like 30 minutes. Eventually you're going to hit a point

192
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,920
where it takes forever to grow stronger. If you rebirth, you'll reset most of your progress in

193
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:53,259
each menu and the bosses will reset. However, in return your number will grow. Number is, well,

194
00:23:53,259 --> 00:24:00,140
it's a number. Your attack and defense get multiplied by number and your number can get

195
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:08,700
ridiculously big. Like stupid big. Like past your mama jokes big. So anytime progress feels slow,

196
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,299
it's probably time to rebirth and reset some progress to get your number up. You can try

197
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:17,420
rebirthing now if you want, but if you wait longer, your number will even grow even bigger.

198
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:23,670
Rebirth time is a big factor to decide the size of your number up until 60 minutes. I should have

199
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:27,589
just rebirthed at the very beginning. You can check how long your rebirth has been going on in the

200
00:24:27,589 --> 00:24:33,819
stats menu. Cool. When you rebirth, bosses also respond with a higher number. With a high enough

201
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:38,059
number, you can defeat the high numbered bosses, which will reward experience every time they

202
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:47,210
defeat. Get to boss 17 and you'll unlock another thing. See you. All right. 65 million HP, 4 million.

203
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:53,190
What do you got for defense? Let's, uh oh. Wiping the mouse guts from between your fingers,

204
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:56,069
you head off down the sewers and make your escape. Barely rounding the second corner,

205
00:24:56,069 --> 00:25:05,500
you face your next major foe, a slightly bigger mouse. You know what to do. What do I got for attack?

206
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:14,440
Uh, I think, I think I'm going to win. I should still win. I'm not going to run.

207
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,839
Nuke. No, I don't nuke. Click this button to blast through all those scrub bosses that you can

208
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:24,549
annihilate with a flick of your fingers. Your wrist will thank me later. I don't want to do that.

209
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:30,440
What do you mean I can't win? I just, I just destroyed it. How much experience do I have?

210
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:43,079
No, my defense is going up by the million. Uh oh. You start feeling lost in the identical looking

211
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:50,279
passageways, dripping with all sorts of goopy brown waste. This is just a shit stream. This

212
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:55,079
is a poo stream, I guess. You're worrying that you'll never escape these sewers and that every

213
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:59,319
bossy face is just going to be some variation of a rat. Cutting off your nose is starting to

214
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:09,509
seem like a good idea too. The stink. 325 million HP, 32 million attack. Okay, don't die. That was

215
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:23,559
close. Uh, what do I have to inventory? Oh god. Item list. This has like the same amount of items

216
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:33,609
as Binding of Isaac does. All right, basic training. I only have 500. Okay, I have to go back. I think

217
00:26:33,609 --> 00:26:47,779
I have to rebirth. I have 20 experience points to spend. No, I can't do it. Adventure. Okay,

218
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:57,299
safe zone. Awakening. I only have, all I can do is block. Blocks 50% of incoming damage for the next

219
00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:14,099
three seconds. I don't even have an attack. All right, let's go. Tutorial zone. Idle mode. Click

220
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:18,099
to toggle idle mode on and off. When on, a stick has attacked. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

221
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:24,420
Automatically attacks every one second while on health regen. All right, let's turn it on.

222
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:34,259
Where's my actual, I can't attack? All right, I'm gonna beat the stick. HP rag up. One eight, one,

223
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:39,140
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. When on, automatically attacks every one second. You get

224
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:44,099
20% health regen. Cannot use any other moves. Damage multiplier of 1.2. Fighting a stick again.

225
00:27:44,819 --> 00:27:49,829
I don't have any manual attacks yet. Oh, okay. What happens if I get to zero HP? Does the game end?

226
00:27:53,240 --> 00:28:05,900
Uh oh. Uh, I don't think I'm gonna do this. I think I'm gonna lose. I'm gonna die. He's doing

227
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:12,309
too much damage. I need like a health potion. I'm dead. A small mouse has defeated you. I lost.

228
00:28:15,589 --> 00:28:23,380
Well, all right, I got, hold on. This is a different game mode entirely. What do I have? 65

229
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:40,309
million? Requires 5,000 levels in attack to level this up. Equipment, okay. Use the boost you find

230
00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:47,509
to improve. This is 4G's merge and boost tutorial cube. Level 4 accessory. Use the boost you find

231
00:28:47,509 --> 00:28:52,470
to improve this item's stats. Find additional cubes and drag onto this item to merge and

232
00:28:52,470 --> 00:29:03,380
increase stat caps by 1% per level rounded down. One. Oh, shit. There it is. I hope to God it really

233
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:09,430
is just a stick. A level 10 weapon. Merge extra copies of the stick onto this item to raise its

234
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:15,029
level. Each level increases an equipment's max stats by 1% rounded down, up to double the original

235
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:27,779
stats at level 100. You can do this a fucking hundred times? Oh, shit. So what does this do?

236
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:36,200
Power boost? Drag this item onto any equipment. Wait. To raise its stat by 1. Raising equipment's

237
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:42,549
current stat to its cap to really toughness boost. Oh, shit. I can put this on a stick.

238
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:48,519
Don't waste it. Don't waste it. Should I not waste it? Oh, it's on max power. All right, yeah.

239
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:54,069
Fuck it. I'm not gonna waste these. All right, cool. Let's go back to adventure and see what

240
00:29:54,069 --> 00:30:01,269
happens. Let's see if we can fight that motherfucker again. Now I got a stick. 13 power. Let's go.

241
00:30:01,589 --> 00:30:15,940
There it is. Yeah, you ain't gonna win. I got it. I got this one. This is the train level,

242
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:27,019
if you didn't ever play this. Drop 952 gold. Drop the cloth hat. Oh, yes. Wait, what? Hold on.

243
00:30:27,019 --> 00:30:39,930
I'm gonna lose. Hold on a second. Regular cloth hat worn out and tattered, but at least it feels

244
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:47,910
soft. Merge extra copies so I get one toughness and some health regen. Stats breakdown. Oh,

245
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:55,690
look at all this shit. To satify all the stats nerds. I have so much. I gotta wait. Hold on.

246
00:30:55,690 --> 00:31:04,740
Should I um, all right. Adventure. Wait, is this at three to three? One on one. Fight boss. Can I

247
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:10,900
do anything about this yet? No. This is the wall right now. Click on the special prize. Special

248
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:16,730
prize. Special prize. Hold on. I got a lot of experience. Should I? Is this gonna reset if I

249
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:29,000
rebirth? You're playing an accounting game. Yeah. Oh, fuck. This is going to fire. All right. Wait,

250
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:36,470
wait, wait. 16. Total energy power. Let's do that one. Bang. 1.1. Energy power. It means

251
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:40,950
things do better. I have numbers to go up. That's all I need to know. Wait, wait. There's adventure

252
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:53,690
stats. Oh, shit. Adventure special. More inventory spaces. Fuck. Levels gained in... Wait a minute.

253
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:57,349
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Levels gained in this attack skill would decrease the

254
00:31:57,349 --> 00:32:02,470
amount of energy needed to cap leveling speed upon rebirth. Base attack received per level is a

255
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:11,960
thousand. Oh, let's get this fucking thing leveled up then. You're going to get this game? Yeah,

256
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:18,890
dude. If you like numbers going up, then you might as well get it. Look, this is very clear

257
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:26,759
what this stream is. Title even says it. Let's split this. I need some more. Hold on. Let's

258
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:36,380
do like increments of a hundred. Let's do like a hundred, a hundred, like three hundred.

259
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:43,930
Because I need more defense and HP. Is this a clicker? This is not really. It's more of a

260
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:53,740
management game. No, I can't fight this thing. I think I should rebirth. I'm going to do it.

261
00:32:54,380 --> 00:33:03,289
Let's go back to adventure. All right, so now I should have... Let me try this one more time.

262
00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:21,660
Idle mode. Floating sewage. I feel like I've given up on you. What, because I'm playing an idle game?

263
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:32,299
What the fuck does that mean? There was just a carnival last weekend.

264
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:50,819
Huh? What the fuck? You just increased the amount of time I'm going to play this game by 30 minutes.

265
00:33:51,539 --> 00:34:26,360
You or yourself? We're stuck here forever. Quick, quick call the game boring so he adds time. That's

266
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:38,250
the fucking 500 IQ play. All right, what do we got? Boss battle. Boss battle. I can't do it.

267
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:54,539
I'm going to rebirth here in a second. All right, hold on. I got some stuff. Oh, fuck. There's like

268
00:34:54,539 --> 00:34:59,590
four sausages now. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. If I drag these on top of each other,

269
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:13,099
this has been merged. Does that do anything? Oh, he's playing a clicker game. Does he even

270
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:46,440
care anymore? Yeah, he does. Oh, shit. Okay. Three out of four power. Guys, I think he hates us all

271
00:35:46,440 --> 00:36:07,780
on a personal level. I'm personally offending all 3,700 of you. We just did a carnival stream

272
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:12,900
like a week and a half ago. I think I'm entitled to one cookie clicker stream.

273
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:39,610
Uh, thank you Hurricane Turtle for the 10 community subs. Appreciate it. Put on the stick.

274
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:45,670
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Level 65 weapon. Wait, wait, wait. I didn't even look at

275
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:52,949
this shit. All right, you just add in another hour. Uh, there's no bottom zone. These are all worn

276
00:36:52,949 --> 00:37:03,750
out. Kind of ruins the purpose of these boots, doesn't it? Toughness one. Toughness one. I'm just

277
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:26,889
the dirty guy that fell in the sewer. Holy shit, I'm doing great. I'm going to move 69. Uh, can I go

278
00:37:26,969 --> 00:37:34,659
to- I want to go to a different zone. How do I open up a new zone? Cloth shirt. Oh, fuck,

279
00:37:34,659 --> 00:37:42,739
I can merge these. I think I have to- I have to beat this. I'm not going to be able to do this.

280
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:58,010
All right, it's time to rebirth. Here we go. I'm doing it. It's been 30 minutes.

281
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:02,730
We're at the- all right, we're at the time. We're at the time here where I have to decide

282
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:14,630
if I'm going to play this for a while. And the answer is yes. Anything to do before rebirth.

283
00:38:15,429 --> 00:38:31,159
Let's go. All right, we're back to zero. It's been 25 minutes. It's time to get off the toilet.

284
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:52,820
Give me a break. You just added an hour to the game. All right, 48,000 attack.

285
00:38:54,789 --> 00:39:12,469
I only have a thousand HP. 500,000 HP? What? I need more. How much HP do I have?

286
00:39:12,469 --> 00:39:18,809
All right, so I've rebirthed, which means I get way more per- I get more stats per point now,

287
00:39:18,809 --> 00:39:28,019
and I have a higher energy cap. What if this was my first 24-hour stream? What if I did that?

288
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:44,019
Big mistake. What do you mean? What am I talking about? Look at this. Look at how fast that's going

289
00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:49,849
up because- wait, I want to see the info. Where's the actual stats? That's going up so much faster.

290
00:39:55,349 --> 00:40:05,670
Do it. Do it. Coward. Coward. Coward. Coward. All right, I got- uh, let's do it. Let's split it

291
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:12,440
evenly. 100, 100. I want more HP. All right, now let's just- let's just murder this guy.

292
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:38,420
Bring on the next one. Floating piece of shit. What you guys don't know is I have been on the

293
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:46,099
toilet this whole time. I'm in the bathroom. My whole setup is here. All right, 275. Let's do more

294
00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:55,320
attack. I want this over like 5 million. Did you guys ever make magic potions? I think we already

295
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:12,630
talked about magic potions, right? No, I'm saying like in the sink. Did you guys have five- what,

296
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:19,929
65 million HP? I need some more. We're gonna- what do I got? Pretty dirty. I need more- uh,

297
00:41:19,929 --> 00:41:26,409
I need more help. You guys ever did magic potions in the sink? You take like a- like a small squeeze

298
00:41:26,409 --> 00:41:33,380
of shampoo, a little bit of toothpaste, some conditioner, a little bit of like spray deodorant

299
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:40,019
and- and mix it up and maybe made magic potions. If you say you didn't do that, I don't- I don't

300
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:47,610
believe you and you know what? You've just added 40 minutes to the spring. You see the goddamn

301
00:41:47,610 --> 00:42:14,969
carnival I did two weeks ago? Add a timer. I don't have a timer. All right, I think I can do this.

302
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:28,230
Not yet. Can we get a BRB? How long has it been? We've been going for 43 minutes. By the way,

303
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:33,269
Turtles in Time has a long ass soundtrack. I didn't think it was this long. I thought it was like eight

304
00:42:33,269 --> 00:42:43,960
minutes. It's been 28 minutes of this. 65 million. All right, I gotta get more. What do I got? What's

305
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:53,159
my new cap? You will hit your energy cap in one minute and 52 seconds. I need more HP or something.

306
00:42:53,159 --> 00:43:08,699
What the fuck do I need? Attack. No, I want- I want like- I want 50 million HP and then we're

307
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:12,539
gonna go for an attack. What do I have for experience? Three experience points. I want to-

308
00:43:12,539 --> 00:43:17,980
you know what? Let's make it better for adventure mode. I want more base power. Bingo. 14. That

309
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:30,679
should make it very easy. All right, 34 million. What's he got for defense? 3.5. I got a lot of

310
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:47,510
attack though. What do you think? Think I'm gonna do it? I think I'm gonna do it. All right, here we go.

311
00:43:47,510 --> 00:44:01,179
This was the wall last time. Drain it of its lifeblood. That's what the plan is. Back to basic

312
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:08,300
training. Uh, get it all in attack actually. All of it. 615 cap. I went up by five. I went by 115.

313
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:14,550
Look at that. What's this guy got for defense? 17 million. Let's get to like 20 million attack

314
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:25,099
and I'm gonna put HP up. Experience? I don't have any EXP. I need to make the cap higher.

315
00:44:25,659 --> 00:44:31,610
Once you have 100,000 max energy, you can- you'll find you can't gain anymore just by

316
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:39,670
generating energy. Why? Because I made it that way. All right, let's do adventure mode. Uh,

317
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:52,150
tutorial zone. How do we get out of the tutorial? Do you get experience every time you kill

318
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:56,619
something? I think so. All right, small mouse boss. So how do I get to the out of the zone?

319
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:04,900
He's still in the tutorial. Laugh out loud, MonkaS. Um, I need to tell you guys something very

320
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:13,219
important. This, uh, this game, some people have been continuously playing this game for three years.

321
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:25,289
So, uh, whoa. All right, any, uh, inventory? What do I got? Wait, I get to keep my stuff?

322
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:30,260
Oh shit, I'm getting like all these- hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm gonna get overwhelmed

323
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:38,090
here. Sausage. Three out of five. All right, drag this onto any equipment to boost its special by

324
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:49,500
one. Should I boost this by one? Wait, is this by two? What'd I just do? I just boosted the one to a

325
00:45:49,579 --> 00:46:02,900
one. What have I done? Uh, equip the cube. Oh fuck, I didn't know I could put this on. Wait,

326
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:08,460
so can I- should I put this all in the cube? I'm still picking up dirty socks.

327
00:46:12,389 --> 00:46:25,190
All right, uh, hurricane turtle gave 20 community subs. I'm almost there. Level 87. I need to boost

328
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:34,789
this. Oh, I ran out of music. We might as well move on to Super Mario World OST from Super Nintendo.

329
00:46:34,789 --> 00:46:56,780
We're in a Super Nintendo mood today. All right, uh, I got a level 100 weapon now. Three to six.

330
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:03,099
I can boost it if I wanted to. 100. All right, now- wait, I have 48 million attack. It's time to do

331
00:47:03,099 --> 00:47:09,909
some, uh, I gotta get out. I gotta get over this. Basic training, get this out. Cap it. Let's go.

332
00:47:09,909 --> 00:47:20,139
Spam that. Put every single point in this. I just want- I need like 300 million HP. How do I get more-

333
00:47:20,139 --> 00:47:27,300
wait, I need to kill stuff. Adventure. Let's go. No, we're still in the tutorial. I get- I'm

334
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:39,780
getting out of the tutorial zone. At least he's dropping stuff. Where's my money? Cloth boots.

335
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:46,619
All right, you need to defeat boss seven in- wait, what? You need to defeat boss seven in the fight

336
00:47:46,619 --> 00:47:58,340
boss menu. Oh, shit. I have to kill this. Holy fuck, I didn't realize how much attack I had.

337
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:10,570
I think it's gonna happen. He makes all the rooms. Well, he's dead. Brown slime. Boss seven. 162

338
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:15,780
million attack. That's- that's not good. Finally, you begin to feel a cool breeze from one path

339
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:21,699
and heading down it, you see a light at the end. Just before the exit, a large menacing brown blob

340
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:26,420
seeps out of the nearby walls, ready to fight. Well, it's as menacing as a blob of poo can get it.

341
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:33,559
That's poo. Okay, so what do you have for defense? I'm not gonna be able to kill this. I need to get

342
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:45,539
what I have to. Uh, more socks. I feel like I should- no. I'm stuck in this- I'm stuck here forever.

343
00:48:45,539 --> 00:48:57,429
I'm just gonna grind gold. This- that- this is 1.6 billion HP. What do I have for defense? 37 million.

344
00:48:57,429 --> 00:49:07,780
This is gonna kill me instantly. Yeah, like, this is impossible. This is not possible. Where's my-

345
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:22,710
do I have to rebirth again? Wait, experience. 3 exp. I- I'm gonna rebirth. All right, we're gonna

346
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:32,070
start over. What do I get for- I have 11 minutes of- of rebirth here. It's not possible, guys.

347
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:48,389
162 million attack. I only have- he'll- he kills me in two seconds. Or like three seconds. Is that

348
00:49:49,030 --> 00:50:06,230
locked? Give the cube food. 9 out of 18 max health. This is for white boss. German the cube. German

349
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:17,909
the cube. The cube. The cube. Use the boosts you find to improve this item's stats and find additional

350
00:50:17,909 --> 00:50:33,929
cubes and drag onto this item to merge and increase stack caps by 1% per level. Uh, how many times can

351
00:50:33,929 --> 00:50:40,900
you- it's level 100. So how do I just throw stuff in the trash? Right here. Use numbers on cube.

352
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:54,599
Is that- should I do that? Everyone's gonna scream at me now. Special. Energy speed. 6 out of 15.

353
00:50:57,139 --> 00:51:16,250
7%. 8%. Is this waste? 9% extra speed and 1 power. Toughness. Can this thing be merged with another

354
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:31,559
cube? Pants. Everyone screams. Pants. So I can do cube and another cube. All right, well I used it

355
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:38,010
all. So, let's see. I- I still have to beat this boss though. 500 million HP. Why is this not going

356
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:51,909
up? Oh, because I have- I'm only doing attack right now. Wait, what? Why am I capped out at HP?

357
00:51:51,909 --> 00:52:11,900
Why am I capped out at HP? Wait, what the hell is this? Now it's going up. Why is it going up?

358
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:27,320
Attack is HP. What? All right, what do I have? 56 million. I can't even come close. Block scales up

359
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:46,199
regen. Is that all it does? Well, fuck. I didn't know that. How am I gonna ever hit through this?

360
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:53,820
Three experience. Let's do energy power. I need 15. Adventure stats. Adventure special. No,

361
00:52:53,820 --> 00:53:05,750
this don't matter until I get- I have to beat the seven blocks. What's the cube got? 6 out of 21

362
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:17,059
max health. 5k per block. Why do I say power like that? Power? Power? Play adventure. I can't. You

363
00:53:17,059 --> 00:53:21,699
need to defeat boss seven and the fight boss to move on. I can't leave the tutorial until I beat

364
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:38,250
this guy. I'm gonna have to rebirth. Power. What's wrong with saying power? How do you say it? Auto

365
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:49,829
merge, auto boost. Well, not yet. I want to see. Combined stick. It's not gonna do anything though.

366
00:53:49,829 --> 00:54:06,119
Little 65 chest. Hurry the fuck up! Hurry the fuck up! Hurry the fuck up! All right, I'm good. 86

367
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:15,900
million. I need to get to defense. 87 million. Now I can- at least now I can hurt it. Kind of.

368
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:25,480
I'm gonna stay for the Mario music. Thanks for watching the stream. Appreciate it. You just added

369
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:43,769
15 more minutes. No, I can't. I don't have enough attack. Play a second idle game by playing this

370
00:54:43,769 --> 00:54:55,380
one. No, I don't have the kind of brain power for that. I think I have to rebirth. After killing this

371
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:59,849
thing is the last thing I'm gonna do. And then I'm gonna rebirth and we're gonna do it again.

372
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:09,500
You just have to AFK. You don't need brain power. Says you. I need all the brain power I can get.

373
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:15,239
Regular attack. Oh, nice. Hold on.

374
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:39,460
What's base attack on this one? Base attack received per levels 150. Oh, well, uh, yeah.

375
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:54,920
I need to get- oh, defense. Right. I have to get to 5,000 defense. You're right. What do I got?

376
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:07,530
113 million. Ah, it's not there yet. It's almost there. Hurry up. You're invincible. I'm not

377
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:16,389
invincible. I'm very killable. Auto merge. Auto boost. Need to unlock auto boost. I can't even

378
00:56:16,389 --> 00:56:27,449
toggle these. Need to buy auto merge in the EXP menu. I can't do this. I'm not allowed to auto

379
00:56:27,449 --> 00:56:44,199
merge. I have to do it by hand. 115 million attack. Come on. Let's go. Damn it. I just need to kill

380
00:56:44,199 --> 00:56:58,300
this guy. Stick can't go over a hundred. Yeah. What does the nuke button do? I believe the nuke

381
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:02,340
button- now somebody correct me if this is incorrect. I believe the nuke button means you

382
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:15,929
can skip whatever you're capable of killing. Right? Wrong. This is just wrong. Wrong. Incorrect. Nuke

383
00:57:15,929 --> 00:57:25,670
just autocompletes easy bosses. That's exactly what I said. You're impatient in an idle game.

384
00:57:28,659 --> 00:57:34,309
It skips to the next game. If I put on the face cam will you guys relax? I just want you guys to

385
00:57:34,309 --> 00:57:43,690
relax. That's what this is. We're just relaxing. You guys just- you guys need to relax with me.

386
00:57:43,690 --> 00:58:08,139
We're gonna get to 1.6 billion. Show auto. The numbers are getting too big.

387
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:17,260
A hundred million is not that big when it comes to space. There's space levels of numbers in this

388
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:30,090
game. All right. Here's what we're gonna do. Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna keep playing this,

389
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:40,519
but I'm gonna play the lava game too. I'm gonna play them both at the same time. In between

390
00:58:40,519 --> 00:58:53,449
levels I'm gonna switch because I want to do this. How much defense do I have? Unfortunately,

391
00:58:53,449 --> 00:59:02,699
the music has to stop though. Uh-oh. Defensive buff. Base defense received isn't- ooh.

392
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:15,449
Shit. I want that- I want to spam that. Thousand per- thousand base defense. How much do I have

393
00:59:15,449 --> 00:59:21,989
right now? Let me just kill this fucking thing. 162 million. All right. Let's go. It's gonna be

394
00:59:21,989 --> 00:59:38,280
close. I'm gonna lose. Fuck. I need a little bit more. Almost- just a little bit more. I need more

395
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:46,150
attack. Defense is all right. I need more attack. Just only attack. Just get it up there. Come on.

396
00:59:46,150 --> 01:00:03,219
Hurry up. Attack in HP. Is it? 107 defense. All right. Now let's only do defense. I'm just going

397
01:00:03,219 --> 01:00:11,500
all in. You just- sometimes you have to go all in completely. You lied about face cam. No, I- I'm

398
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:27,219
moving to, um, hot lava. You regen faster. Oh shit. Holy shit, you're right. So you lied about face cam.

399
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:44,570
You really want me to put on face cam? Is that what you want? Let me kill this. Come on. Who's

400
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:51,480
going down faster? Who's counting down faster? Is it me or them? Oh, it's even. Completely.

401
01:00:52,199 --> 01:01:13,590
Hurry up. How much is he regenning? All right. If I- I gotta regen over what you're regenning

402
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:37,849
and then go again. Put your face as the boss. Hold on. I'm- I'll- I'm- it's- I'm getting addicted.

403
01:01:38,489 --> 01:01:57,780
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Here it is. I did it. He's dead. We don't need to play another game.

404
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:02,739
I did it. You defeated brown slime. You've unlocked a new adventure zone, the sewers. Go to adventure

405
01:02:02,739 --> 01:02:07,210
feature and check it out. I'm addicted. We don't need to play any other game. You finally escape,

406
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:11,449
gasping your first breaths of fresh air. And who knows how long. You shield your eyes for a moment

407
01:02:11,449 --> 01:02:18,019
in the bright sun. Once your eyes adapt to the light, you see a gorgeous green field stretched out

408
01:02:18,579 --> 01:02:23,719
before you, leading up to a forest. You can feel the gloom seeping into every branch. As you approach

409
01:02:23,719 --> 01:02:28,119
the path leading to the forest, a spooky skeleton emerges from the ground, armed with a trumpet.

410
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:33,079
You try not to get distracted by its jazzy tunes while you smash it to dust. This thing is not

411
01:02:33,079 --> 01:02:43,110
going to be killable now. But I did unlock an adventure zone. Oh my god. My inventory is a

412
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:52,380
mess. This is the same inventory that I have when I play Minecraft. I keep so much useless shit and

413
01:02:52,380 --> 01:03:09,780
I have to merge all this. I don't even want these sticks anymore. I have to- no, I'm gonna- that's

414
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:16,019
the first thing I'm gonna buy. I'm gonna buy- oh. I'm gonna buy auto-merge immediately upon rebirth.

415
01:03:16,019 --> 01:03:24,519
Are we almost maxed out? Four. All right, hold on. Adventure. Let's just- let's go to the sewers.

416
01:03:25,159 --> 01:03:34,820
Let's check it out. I'm just sweeping. I'm absolutely stomping right now. 1800 gold. All

417
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:40,659
right. Hold on. I'll put on the face game in like a couple hours. I don't even know how to turn it on.

418
01:03:40,659 --> 01:03:42,579
I'm using a new streamlabs. I have no idea.

419
01:03:49,900 --> 01:04:03,480
Uh-oh, brown slime. We're gonna get some good gear from this one. All right, you guys get to pick.

420
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:13,619
We either play hot lava or you get a face cam. Which one do you want? 2900 gold. Nice. Big rat.

421
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:20,139
Both. Well, I'll end up doing both eventually here. This is- we're just doing the pre-stream.

422
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:27,900
Yeah, I think we're just doing the pre- stream. Guys, I just got off the plane from TwitchCon like

423
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:39,750
four days ago. I need- like I need- I need some time. I'm dead. Ooh, a new dirty shirt. Put it on.

424
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:46,820
Guys, I just got off the plane from San Diego like five days ago. Like, I'm fucking- I just need some

425
01:04:46,820 --> 01:05:03,739
time. We just- we need to play an idle game for a little bit. All right, I lost. It's time to rebirth.

426
01:05:05,769 --> 01:05:14,010
I think so. I'm doing it. Fuck it. I'm doing it. Uh, boss power bonus is going from two to the

427
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:19,929
seventh power, 128. Boss power bonus, last rebirth, two to the fifth power, 35. Current number number

428
01:05:19,929 --> 01:05:27,980
on rebirth, 120. Time factor, training level factor. Nothing to need to do. Go ahead and rebirth.

429
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:39,769
Okay, I'm gonna have 121 times. Let's go. Difficulty normal. I ain't doing that. Rebirth. Bang. Did it.

430
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:47,690
Good. Nice. Nice. All right, I'll get you- do you deserve a face cam for that?

431
01:05:49,289 --> 01:05:51,210
You do. It's gonna be real.

432
01:05:51,210 --> 01:06:03,690
No. You deserve it. I'll give it to you. For like- for- all right, for every resident sleeper that

433
01:06:03,690 --> 01:06:17,539
I see in the chat, I remove a minute from the face cam. What are you gonna do now? All right,

434
01:06:17,539 --> 01:06:29,420
get this out of here. Let's just change categories into just chatting now and just

435
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:36,710
do an ask me anything. Right? Like, how big- okay, I can be like this big. Oh shit, I could be- I

436
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:50,739
could be- I could be this big right now on stream. That's a good track. All right, what's next? I

437
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:55,699
rebirthed. So we're gonna do basic training. I got my- let's go back to the live view.

438
01:07:00,389 --> 01:07:15,829
Star Wars! All right, the cap. I'll have to redo this again. No, don't. I'll knock something off.

439
01:07:15,829 --> 01:07:21,769
I'll break something. Do I fucking love Star Wars? This is not gonna go the way that you think.

440
01:07:22,489 --> 01:07:32,059
This is like the best song in the whole entire fucking Mario catalog of songs.

441
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:40,860
All right, 10 million attack. Need gold. Get loads of gold to unlock this. More unlockables!

442
01:07:44,889 --> 01:07:53,929
Let's just, uh, fight boss. Should I just nuke? I mean, I'm at 18 million attack. Should we just

443
01:07:53,929 --> 01:08:01,050
snap all these guys out of here? Oh shit, I can't be this big. I can't be this big. You

444
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:17,659
can't see the health bar. Gotta have to shrink it. I can't be here either. I can't know, because

445
01:08:17,659 --> 01:08:21,020
the- look at what- look what happens if I do that. That fucks this whole thing up.

446
01:08:21,819 --> 01:08:35,779
That fucks up the whole thing. God damn it. I can't. I can't do it. This- I- it's too much-

447
01:08:37,819 --> 01:08:40,939
Nope, I can't do it. I was gonna get hurt and have that song play right now.

448
01:08:41,979 --> 01:08:46,340
This thing. I was trying- I was like, what is over here that I could get hurt with?

449
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:54,619
I don't even know where it is. Here it is. This guy- I was gonna have like something fall and

450
01:08:54,619 --> 01:08:59,909
like drop and hit me in the head, like lean on and be like, oh no. What happened? Oh shit!

451
01:08:59,909 --> 01:09:15,960
Oh, he- he got hurt! And he died! He took a hurt. Yeah, it was made out of fucking Play-Doh.

452
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:25,460
All right, let's go back to the song. All right, what was I doing? Good idea, poor execution.

453
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:27,939
You sometimes you think of something that you want to do, and then like,

454
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:36,359
I think 15 seconds go by and you're like, wait a minute. I want to do that. And then you don't.

455
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:45,460
That's not right. Nuke everybody. I only have 20,000 HP. Oh, fuck. Wait, why is this so low?

456
01:09:47,479 --> 01:10:01,079
But it's- it's really low for me. What did I do? Oh, that's why. Because my headphones got like

457
01:10:01,079 --> 01:10:12,250
unplugged. Okay, now that's better. All right, I need to go- I need to exp- oh wait, back to

458
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:24,380
training. What's 570's cap? Let's get it at 317. There we go. Now you can't hear it. Yeah, you can.

459
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:34,699
That's fine. You can hear that. What does sour please mean? It means dance. It's like a I'm dancing

460
01:10:34,699 --> 01:10:48,789
thing. I don't know. I just learned about that like two or three months ago, so. You can't lie,

461
01:10:48,789 --> 01:10:54,970
this idle game has a really good soundtrack. I mean, it does. It does. It's a pretty good soundtrack.

462
01:10:54,970 --> 01:11:00,979
Nuke this guy. All right, that's pretty cool that you can do that. Uh, I have to fight the mouse,

463
01:11:00,979 --> 01:11:13,220
though. Six- we're over the cap right now. That's good. Put this over. Fix the face cam location.

464
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:22,420
Isn't that- isn't this way- you wanted it? I thought it was supposed to be right here.

465
01:11:22,979 --> 01:11:32,090
Is it- it's not fine there? It should be. I mean, you can't see how much energy is being

466
01:11:32,729 --> 01:11:41,909
allocated. Put it over here. What about- there's nowhere for it to go. Come on, let me show you.

467
01:11:41,909 --> 01:11:51,899
What if it was down here? That's not a bad place for it. Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. You- I

468
01:11:51,899 --> 01:11:55,720
want to see the artwork. Did you guys want to see- it's not gonna be my face for every single boss.

469
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:10,659
I'm sorry. Come on. Okay, I have- let's get rid of- okay, that was instant. I don't want to hurt my

470
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:20,859
eyes. Gone. All right, this is why you rebirth. How much experience do I have? 10. I want energy

471
01:12:20,859 --> 01:12:25,899
power. This upgrade improves the effectiveness of your allocated energy. This means faster progress

472
01:12:25,899 --> 01:12:42,409
on features while using less energy. I don't- I have enough. I love this game. I'm playing it right

473
01:12:42,409 --> 01:12:58,680
now. Thanks. Why'd I say thanks? Like, oh, thanks. Yeah, I like this too. Thanks. I don't know. I

474
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:05,800
have no idea. I'm gonna do that. Should I do more base energy speed? I don't think that's- that's

475
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:17,260
not doing- hmm. You know what? We're going all in on attack for now. Pull this all out. Cap the whole

476
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:27,859
thing. 778 points. Fight the boss. Boom. Just- you know how long this took last time? This was such

477
01:13:27,859 --> 01:13:36,300
a fucking pain in the ass last time, and now we're at the skeleton trumpet. Although I have to wait

478
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:45,909
for this one. Time for adventure mode. What do I have for inventory? Okay, this is unchanged.

479
01:13:46,789 --> 01:13:58,729
Adventure. Sewers. Let's go. Put on the Doom Eternal OST. The actual dev is here.

480
01:14:00,890 --> 01:14:07,720
Actual dev in chat. This game's fucking fun. I'm already addicted. I- I didn't know if I- you know,

481
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:10,600
I- I crossed a path where I didn't think I was gonna get addicted. I wasn't sure.

482
01:14:11,850 --> 01:14:25,699
And everyone here is addicted too. So that's what- this is what we're doing. Let's get some

483
01:14:25,699 --> 01:14:35,500
Skyrim OST on here. I think that fits. Uh, do I have any inventory? Ooh, what's this? Crappy

484
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:43,350
helmet level four. One out of five. And better health regen. Oh, get this out of here. That's

485
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:47,109
much better. Throw it away. Wait, should I throw this away? I'm gonna hold on to it. Throw it away.

486
01:14:47,829 --> 01:15:01,529
All right, we got 2.5- uh, 800 million attack. Basic training. Let's go back here. Oh, I'm just

487
01:15:01,529 --> 01:15:17,130
stomping in here. That's fine. Level every item to 100. I'll- I'll give it a try. I do want more- I

488
01:15:17,130 --> 01:15:22,500
need more defense. I'm gonna get- let me get this to 5,000 first. And then I'm gonna put 100 points.

489
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:34,020
Wait, listen. 100 points are gonna go here. And then 670 are gonna go down here. I think that's

490
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:41,939
a good idea. Once an item gets to level 100, you need to start putting the boosts into them.

491
01:15:44,119 --> 01:16:03,720
Fuck, okay. German. Okay, um, why is the block not going up? Because I don't have any energy in it.

492
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:07,479
I'm just trying to spam this until I get to a point where I'm gonna bring it down. Because one

493
01:16:09,189 --> 01:16:17,130
level of idle attack is worth 150. One level of regular attack is worth a thousand.

494
01:16:17,770 --> 01:16:21,819
So that's how you play the math there. Let's spam this one now.

495
01:16:22,859 --> 01:16:29,539
678. Spam it. Wait, cap. So that's the high- that's as fast as it can possibly go.

496
01:16:30,869 --> 01:16:42,810
So 549 is as fast as I can do it. I think I broke it. Did I break it? Because when I do- all right,

497
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:48,739
for instance, ready? Like, cap. Like, cap seems to be different. Like, why is it different?

498
01:16:52,579 --> 01:16:55,939
Cap just puts all your idle energy into it. All right, well let's do this for a little bit. I got

499
01:16:55,939 --> 01:17:03,380
1.2 billion attack. Fight the boss. He's got 8.1 billion HP. He's got 4.37.500 million.

500
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:10,359
He's dead. I think I can ride it out. I think I can ride it out. Skeleton's about to go down.

501
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:15,659
Boys and girls, Skeleton's about to go down. Can I get you some hype in the chat, please?

502
01:17:15,659 --> 01:17:30,460
I need to fucking think about it. Goblin. Seek out the wizard further on. You hear sighing from the

503
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:37,020
pulverized bone dust. Now swept away by the wind you venture past. Thankful for the advice. Though

504
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:43,100
unsure where to go other than deeper into this rather sinister looking forest. Before long you

505
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:48,380
sense something above you and dart out of the way just before a tiny hawk marked figure falls

506
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:55,020
onto the ground where you were. Uh-oh. Droop's in trouble. The goblin shrieks in a gross nasally

507
01:17:55,020 --> 01:18:06,949
voice. The face game needs to be moved back. I can read that to you. It's okay. So he's got 4.- 4

508
01:18:06,949 --> 01:18:21,060
billion. 2- 40 billion HP. 40 billion HP. Okay. I love how that's just a what the fuck do I do

509
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:29,100
button. I need to get more shit in the adventure mode. Back to the sewers. Let's go. Idle mode.

510
01:18:29,739 --> 01:18:39,460
Activate it. Small mouse. Face game would be better in the bottom right. This is the bottom

511
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:51,510
right. All right. Bronze slime. He's got poison. Two poison damage. No, bottom left. I need- I want

512
01:18:51,510 --> 01:19:04,180
some more coffee. Should I go get some more coffee? Ooh, I got a cracked amulet. Wait. Cracked

513
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:11,979
amulet. I need to see what that does. This one isn't covered in poo. This is a bunch of poo,

514
01:19:11,979 --> 01:19:18,659
but it's brown anyways. Feels like the useful in combat. That's pretty good. That's actually

515
01:19:18,659 --> 01:19:28,539
really good. What am I doing in my training here? Yeah, that's good. Just keep that. You know what?

516
01:19:28,539 --> 01:19:35,029
Do this. Just to keep this kind of even here. I ignored subs. I didn't see them. Where are they?

517
01:19:40,229 --> 01:19:46,420
What is this game actually called? It's called N-G-U-Idle. It's on Steam. It's free to play.

518
01:19:47,300 --> 01:20:00,539
Did I miss subs? Did I? I- I don't see them. How many? How many were there? Because they're not

519
01:20:00,539 --> 01:20:11,670
here. The dev gifted subs. It was 10? Why is this not here? Parag- Paraguay just gave 10 community

520
01:20:11,670 --> 01:20:19,989
subs. That was 10 from- that was 10 from before too. That's 20. So that's the dev of this game.

521
01:20:20,630 --> 01:20:32,310
I need that confirmed by- by somebody. I need that to be confirmed. Yes. What's going on?

522
01:20:34,489 --> 01:20:41,380
That's all I have to say. Hey, what's up? Cool game. But thank you for the 20 community subs.

523
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:50,859
That means a lot. It's an interesting concept. It's a fun game. I'm liking it. Let's keep this

524
01:20:50,859 --> 01:20:59,609
down here now. And then right after that, DemonsB gave 5,500 bits and they said,

525
01:21:00,779 --> 01:21:04,939
I have chronic pain and watching your streams helps take my mind off of it.

526
01:21:04,939 --> 01:21:10,380
I was enjoying part two of your recetteer VOD when about now I was in you leaned into the mic

527
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:15,579
and loudly said, wake up if you're sleeping, wake up and turn off the stream. You then loudly yelled

528
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:20,619
over some silly little bullshit in the anime game. Why? What the heck dude? Love you anyways.

529
01:21:21,979 --> 01:21:27,560
I think you're really talented. But I'm really sorry to hear about the first part here. This-

530
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:31,079
the chronic pain. I can't imagine how much that must suck.

531
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:40,340
As somebody that also deals with chronic illness, it's not fun. So I know what that's like. Thank

532
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:46,680
you for the 5,500 fucking bits. And sorry for waking you up, but sometimes you gotta wake people

533
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:52,310
up. Like for instance, right now, we've been streaming for an hour and 25 minutes. And I know

534
01:21:52,310 --> 01:21:55,670
for a fact that there's, let's say there's 40, almost 4,500 people there. I know at least a

535
01:21:55,670 --> 01:22:01,369
thousand people fell asleep. So I have to wake them up and in probably the best possible way,

536
01:22:01,369 --> 01:22:09,670
I think. Dude, what the fuck? No fucking way. No fucking way. It's free money coming through

537
01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:14,899
right now. The screen. You just have to click the screen. It says it's free money there. No way.

538
01:22:14,899 --> 01:22:27,800
No fucking way. I just got a hundred dollars. I just got $200. You gotta be kidding me. Welcome

539
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:36,229
back. What's this? What's this message today? Hey, Jeremiah, I just had a weird dream that like you

540
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:43,319
screaming in the mic about free money and stuff. That's weird. Welcome back though. If you were

541
01:22:43,319 --> 01:22:55,109
sleeping. That's weird. Free? Like free? What do you mean free money? That's odd. I hope you had a

542
01:22:55,109 --> 01:23:09,270
good nap, I guess. So what do we got? Let's go fight boss. 40 billion, 13 billion. What do you

543
01:23:09,270 --> 01:23:14,390
got for attack? 1.3 billion. Defense, 2 billion. This ain't gonna work out. We're gonna go to

544
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:18,710
adventure mode. What do I got for my inventory? Not gonna work out. I need more gold. How much

545
01:23:18,710 --> 01:23:28,229
gold do I have? That's not gonna work out either. Time to rebirth. I need something. There's nothing

546
01:23:28,229 --> 01:23:42,460
in this. There is nothing in this container. Hello? Nobody in there. I need to refill that.

547
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:57,670
Wait. Also drop 4G's merge and boost tutorial cube. All right. So if I put these together,

548
01:23:57,670 --> 01:24:20,630
what happens? Uh oh. That was a mistake. All right. Let's go. Sewers. More loot. More idle

549
01:24:20,630 --> 01:24:27,399
equipment. You've ruined it. Reset. I can rebirth in like 15 minutes. Increases the cap of all the

550
01:24:27,399 --> 01:24:34,310
skills. That's, that's all right. That's cool. Got 1800 gold. How much gold do I need? Do I need

551
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:52,119
change the fucking music? Hold on. Hey, we'll put on, how about like peaceful piano music?

552
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:22,220
I just had a fucking craze. Colonel Sanders was just chasing me in a fucking pool with a chainsaw.

553
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:30,020
I was trying to swim the fuck away. He was behind me with a fucking chainsaw.

554
01:27:30,739 --> 01:27:44,979
It like stuck it through my chest. Well, did I make it? It's been seven, seven and a half hours.

555
01:27:44,979 --> 01:28:16,170
Did I do it? I did it. No, not quite. Not quite there yet. Not there. Another 45 minutes. He's

556
01:28:16,170 --> 01:28:34,359
wearing lipstick. Why did this happen? This is fucking scary. He's got, he's got white walker eyes.

557
01:28:39,180 --> 01:29:35,000
Hold on a second. It's trying to correct it, is what it's doing. It's on auto and it's correcting

558
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:52,260
it. It's like patient zero. This is like the part of the movie where they like, I was an actor in

559
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:57,770
the movie, right? And over the course of maybe like 30, 40 minutes, I'm like, I'm like the funny guy

560
01:29:57,770 --> 01:30:02,569
and the funny character that's in the zombie apocalypse movie. And I start getting sick.

561
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:10,220
And after, you know, I go, I go get quarantined in like the fucking shop behind us.

562
01:30:11,020 --> 01:30:18,060
And this, I'm the first person to turn. And it's like, oh no, not the funny guy. Not the guy that

563
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:24,180
was making all those funny jokes during the whole movie. And I'm not funny anymore. Oh no, no, no,

564
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:43,739
no. Now I'm out for fucking blood. I fucked this whole camera, but I don't even know what to do now.

565
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:53,640
This fucking music's been playing the whole time in the background.

566
01:30:56,710 --> 01:31:17,220
I don't know. I can't fix it. No, I'm not doing the sleep thing again. I need to fix the webcam.

567
01:31:17,939 --> 01:31:36,949
Hey, there we go. Hi. I look better than I did before. Don't have a wink. How much XP did I get?

568
01:31:43,770 --> 01:31:57,770
Funny. The funny guy. I got my eye on you. I'm noticing how triangular his face is.

569
01:31:57,770 --> 01:32:06,300
I got my eye on you. All right, let's go back to what we were doing.

570
01:32:10,220 --> 01:32:21,979
Uh, have I just been, oh shit, wait, put on Kirby? Sure. What do you want? Kirby's,

571
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:28,090
we got Kirby's Adventure, Kirby's Epic Yarn, Kirby's Dream Land, Kirby's Epic Yarn,

572
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:32,170
OST, Kirby's Dream Course, Kirby's Adventure, OST, Kirby's Dream Land 3, Kirby's Dream Land 3, OST,

573
01:32:32,170 --> 01:32:46,100
Kirby's Dream Superstar, Air Ride. There's a lot here. Kirby's Air Ride, OST. Cool. All right.

574
01:32:46,579 --> 01:33:09,960
All right. Cool. Nice. Is this what you want? This is what you wanted, right? All right. Okay.

575
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:18,300
Uh, gross ring level four. Wait, what is this one? Combine them. Zero out of one, zero to three,

576
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:30,539
toughness zero to one, health regen. One, three, one. That's good. What about this one? This is

577
01:33:30,539 --> 01:33:36,300
one out of five. That just kind of scared me. One out of five, three, 15, level four,

578
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:43,899
it's now level nine. Get it up there again. I've got the new cube still on. That's good.

579
01:33:44,699 --> 01:33:51,300
So in this, have I really capped out here? What am I putting my points into?

580
01:33:56,979 --> 01:34:06,659
Really? Only three and a half billion? That's kind of bullshit. Oh, that's a baseline I can

581
01:34:06,659 --> 01:34:15,220
get behind. All right. Okay. What is this? Let's see. No. I think I have to rebirth.

582
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:29,159
That's, that's meaty. Yeah, that's a meaty base. 20, 18. Let's shoot this one down easily.

583
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:41,989
Poison. That's all right. No enemies. All right. You got the tutorial cube. Sewers. Big rat.

584
01:34:42,789 --> 01:34:48,420
Kill it. You can't see it. I have to make it smaller. I know you can't see it. I know.

585
01:34:49,779 --> 01:35:05,579
I'm trying. I know. Am I gonna? Bronze lion boss. Die. Got it. 2900 gold. Cracked amulet.

586
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:21,000
Small mouse. Kill it. How much more gold do I need? Slightly bigger mouse. Move my camera

587
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:27,369
into the bottom left and flip it. I see what you're saying. Try it. See what it looks.

588
01:35:28,010 --> 01:35:46,649
That like seems strange though. I'm like flipped the wrong way. I'm wearing a rat's t-shirt now.

589
01:35:47,449 --> 01:35:55,460
All right. I'm low money. Need gold. Get loads of gold. I don't know how much I have.

590
01:35:56,100 --> 01:36:07,539
How much gold do I even own? I don't know. I don't fucking know.

591
01:36:10,489 --> 01:36:17,670
Rat wars. Rats wars. Ben Folds. People could be giving a lot of money today.

592
01:36:19,899 --> 01:36:24,460
Every start of the Kirby's soundtrack startles me. I don't know if I want to listen to it anymore.

593
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:35,029
But Ben Folds gave 10,000 bits. They say Jerma's holding my bits hostage until I give him more

594
01:36:35,029 --> 01:36:42,630
money. Not true. But thank you for the $100. It's 10,000 bits. Jerma, I think you didn't

595
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:47,430
see my last bits but just want to say that you're my favorite streamer and you've got me through a

596
01:36:47,430 --> 01:36:53,979
lot of rough patches. I can always count on you right in my day. Jerma Heart. Jerma Heart right

597
01:36:53,979 --> 01:37:01,619
back at you. Thank you for the 10,000 bits. That's a shitload of money. Thank you. I'm just kicking

598
01:37:01,619 --> 01:37:07,140
ass in here. I got to beat boss 17 to advance to the next level. Are you kidding me? How am I going

599
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:16,119
to do that? But thank you. Seriously. Also Lunch Meat just gave five community subs. Thanks a lot

600
01:37:16,119 --> 01:37:27,369
Lunch Meat. Welcome to the stream. Anybody that's just joining us. 2700 gold. All right it's time.

601
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:52,949
We're rebirthing here. We are rebirthing. Too bald to work. Money Pit. Is this Kingdom Hearts

602
01:37:52,949 --> 01:37:59,510
or what is this? Money Pit. Bottomless pit. Just throw all your heart and gold into it. What?

603
01:37:59,510 --> 01:38:10,359
The pit is hungry. Click it to feed it all your gold. This is a daily spin. So it doesn't actually

604
01:38:10,439 --> 01:38:19,590
spin but it's random. Tier 0 daily spin reward table. 500 arbitrary points. Let's spin the wheel.

605
01:38:29,529 --> 01:38:40,649
100? What? That's it? All right that's it. Wait time until next spin. Check the timer. Your daily

606
01:38:40,649 --> 01:38:48,010
spin is not active yet. Feed me. Do you want to toss all of your hard-earned gold into the pit?

607
01:38:48,010 --> 01:38:54,090
Yeah. You feel slightly more powerful. Plus one to power to be exact. How much money do I have?

608
01:38:54,970 --> 01:39:02,300
Oh. All right. Fight the boss. What have I got? 16 billion. 40 billion. 1.6 billion. 4 billion.

609
01:39:03,739 --> 01:39:08,859
I have. My defense is not terrible but his defense is higher than mine. We have to do something else

610
01:39:08,859 --> 01:39:14,060
here. We gotta. Oh excuse me. No thank you. Put all of the points into here. We need to build this up

611
01:39:14,060 --> 01:39:31,289
a little bit. Oh this is a good OST. Nice choice. Not a bad OST. I have more than twice as much

612
01:39:31,289 --> 01:39:41,130
defense. Well he's got four billion attack so realistically he's got like 695 million wiggle

613
01:39:41,130 --> 01:39:48,149
room there to hurt me and I believe this is you know this you know you know I'm saying like if

614
01:39:48,149 --> 01:39:52,949
this is higher than this then it's gonna hurt you but if the same it leaves itself up. I don't know

615
01:39:52,949 --> 01:40:01,430
how it works. I'm not a mathematician. I just fucking watch the numbers. Is this fighting right

616
01:40:01,430 --> 01:40:13,479
now? I can't tell if we're fighting. That's exactly what I was telling you. See? We're almost perfect.

617
01:40:13,479 --> 01:40:21,289
Nobody can get hurt. I have 1.8 attack. I can't even hurt him. Okay. He has four billion attack

618
01:40:21,289 --> 01:40:36,220
so he can kind of hurt me a little bit. Oh shit. I have lots. Wait a minute. Okay. Um. I got one

619
01:40:36,220 --> 01:40:45,460
of these cubes again and this necklace. Level 9 accessory. 14. So that's one. Uh. Crappy chest

620
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:51,449
plate. Three toughness. That's better than this. I'm gonna hold on to that though. What about these

621
01:40:51,449 --> 01:40:57,609
crappy leggings? Three out of three. One out of one. All right. Um. Maybe I should keep these?

622
01:40:58,409 --> 01:41:06,550
What can I my cube hold? More power. I'm at max power now and max health. What about toughness?

623
01:41:09,350 --> 01:41:13,989
All right. I'm at four to seven. What about special? I can do this three more times. I want

624
01:41:13,989 --> 01:41:20,069
the noob cube to be completely upgraded. Merge the cube. Last time I did that everybody laughed

625
01:41:20,069 --> 01:41:41,909
at me. I got laughed completely out of town here. Is that worth it? Okay. Level 9 chest. I think

626
01:41:41,909 --> 01:41:51,079
that's good for now. 20 billion health. 40 billion. I still need more attack. Attack tube. I'm never

627
01:41:51,079 --> 01:42:00,170
gonna get there. Energy power. Let's do this one. 0.1. That was not even worth it I don't think.

628
01:42:00,170 --> 01:42:18,220
Wait did I? It instantly went up. That was a mistake. Okay. Inventory is four out of four

629
01:42:18,220 --> 01:42:27,609
power. It's already better. And it's level four. So I am now able to move on but I can't because I

630
01:42:27,609 --> 01:42:37,260
have to beat the 17th boss here. I'm only boss nine. This is boss number nine. Why does you

631
01:42:37,260 --> 01:42:49,140
already have a bathroom cam? Just in case. I don't know. I don't want to get up. Fight. Wait a minute.

632
01:42:53,300 --> 01:43:07,140
I can kill it. That means I can nuke it right? See you later. No. I can't. Nope. I have to fight it.

633
01:43:07,140 --> 01:43:21,930
We have to watch this go down. Nuke is only when you can instantly win. I see. What are you guys

634
01:43:21,930 --> 01:43:25,930
what are you guys linking images for? What's on these images? So I think it's something that's

635
01:43:25,930 --> 01:43:59,579
gonna embarrass me. No it's just you traced my face. I know exactly what you did here. Actually

636
01:43:59,579 --> 01:44:07,579
how did you how did you do this? Did you just take a screenshot and then trace it? I don't even know

637
01:44:07,579 --> 01:44:17,300
what the fuck it is. Where did it just go? Save it. Save the desktop. It's there. What the fuck?

638
01:44:21,350 --> 01:44:46,470
I have so much dog shit on my desktop. It's unbelievable. I didn't mean to do that. Bring

639
01:44:46,470 --> 01:45:00,520
it back. You're not leaving yet. There it is. Looks pretty good. I look very I look very sad

640
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:08,600
and tired. Whoa. I won? I didn't even get a chance to see my victory. That was like an hour and a

641
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:15,689
half in the making. God damn it. What did I get for that? Holy shit. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

642
01:45:15,689 --> 01:45:25,989
Money. Experience. This guy's got 200 billion HP. 10 versus three. No we have to revert this one.

643
01:45:25,989 --> 01:45:35,050
No way I'm doing this shit. Uh-uh. Wait whoa whoa whoa whoa. Money pit. Throw it in there. Whatever.

644
01:45:36,140 --> 01:45:38,939
Oh I can't. I have to wait an hour and a half. I have to wait two hours to do this.

645
01:45:40,630 --> 01:45:46,979
Buy energy speed. You're killing me. I already have been. I got two points for energy speed.

646
01:45:48,489 --> 01:45:52,489
What song is this? I feel like I'm going crazy not remembering this. This is from curvy's air ride

647
01:45:53,289 --> 01:45:58,729
uh ost and I don't know what the name of the song is but it's the full soundtrack

648
01:46:00,119 --> 01:46:06,039
just in the background while we just hang out and fucking play the game that everybody was

649
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:15,640
very happy and excited to play. I was. All right let's do uh I got three. I'll do it again. Fine.

650
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:27,609
Energy speed. Cool. All right back to the uh this is a 40 minute rebirth time. What do you think?

651
01:46:31,909 --> 01:46:36,460
2,500. This is how the number that we have just exponentially increased.

652
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:50,010
Let's do it. Boom. Inventory. Let's let's make this. This is a mess.

653
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:56,500
Toughness. I can still do a few more toughness in here. What's my what are my stats out here?

654
01:46:56,500 --> 01:47:04,619
Plus 15 plus 12. Special energy bonus. Cracked amulet is at 14. I'm gonna have to start putting

655
01:47:04,619 --> 01:47:12,220
points into these too aren't I? 4 to 20. 4 to 21. This stick is just kind of taking up space.

656
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:25,989
The mouse is broken. What do you mean? I can still see it. What's my uh energy cap now?

657
01:47:30,890 --> 01:47:39,880
Already at five million. Fight boss. It took one second. Every time you rebirth the longer

658
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:48,279
you do it and the more you just you get exponentially more. I can just click it. Oh he killed me.

659
01:47:49,420 --> 01:48:04,539
Right. Oops. All right that's fine. I'm in the millions now. Dubai. Four million. Nothing. 11

660
01:48:04,539 --> 01:48:16,260
million. Nothing. 65 million HP. Mouse. You're out. Large rat. 325 million HP. Let's keep let's

661
01:48:16,260 --> 01:48:24,409
keep that going up. 28 million. Now I know why that person said get the speed man. That's what

662
01:48:24,489 --> 01:48:29,420
I'm going for it. I'll try to get a couple. I should do just one. Two. Four. Six. Eight. Ten.

663
01:48:29,420 --> 01:48:37,960
Twelve. Four. Six. Eight. Twenty. I guess it is the same. Drugs are bad. What are you implying

664
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:49,319
that I'm on drugs? Why are you implying I'm on drugs? All right. How much attack? Oh you keep.

665
01:48:49,319 --> 01:48:58,899
See you later. What do you got for defense? 87 million. You're dead. 437 million defense.

666
01:48:59,699 --> 01:49:10,220
He killed me. All right. I'm dead. Don't matter. I'll just restart. Cap that out. I want more

667
01:49:10,220 --> 01:49:22,310
defense. I want one billion defense and it's all going into idle attack. The adventure zone. I will

668
01:49:22,310 --> 01:49:33,460
in just a second. All right. Almost there. Let's see what we got now. One billion. Your attack. I

669
01:49:33,460 --> 01:49:39,060
need your. I need to have a little bit higher defense than this. We are. We're already at the

670
01:49:39,060 --> 01:49:48,310
wall. Fuck. We are already at the wall already. Adventure. All right. Let's go back to the sewers

671
01:49:48,949 --> 01:50:01,670
and just farm. Farm money. Has it been 30? 40? I'm sucked in. Pretty good Beetlejuice song. Not bad.

672
01:50:15,819 --> 01:50:23,720
Play the Beetlejuice OST. I don't think anybody wants to hear that. There it is. All right. He's

673
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:32,729
out. What was the last thing that I got to? Wasn't the goblin. This is 40 billion. I need some time

674
01:50:32,729 --> 01:50:51,210
here. Need HP and need attack. What's my cap right now? Probably 800. 1,045 energy is what I can have.

675
01:50:53,640 --> 01:51:02,020
Sounds pretty good to me. What I got to experience. 2 EXP. Energy speed. Keep going. Money pit. 47

676
01:51:02,020 --> 01:51:14,250
minutes. Don't say it again. All right. I already made that joke. I think I've done that joke twice.

677
01:51:15,050 --> 01:51:25,979
All right. Kirby's Air Ride was pretty cool, but let's do another one. How about do WarioWare?

678
01:51:26,539 --> 01:51:41,340
That's pretty good. I like that one. Wario Wario WarioWare OST. Smooth moves. Yeah. That's the one.

679
01:51:42,619 --> 01:51:52,489
That's track one. Here comes track two. I'm not sure why there's a track specifically for him

680
01:51:52,489 --> 01:52:03,720
doing the voice line. All right. What do we got? 12 billion? 5 billion. I think I can do it now.

681
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:22,920
Yeah. This is the intro. This is a classic game. All right. Here comes the wall. 20 billion. 10

682
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:31,770
billion. I can get over that, but I need this to be higher. Holy shit. I need more. This is hurting

683
01:52:31,770 --> 01:52:35,779
my eyes looking at this. I can't look at this for more than five seconds. It actually hurts my head.

684
01:52:36,420 --> 01:52:47,210
Oh shit. More of this. Helmet. Just drag the helmets together and then on top. Level 19 head.

685
01:52:51,590 --> 01:52:58,060
Ring. I'm going to keep just combining the rings until they're better. I think I'm going to start

686
01:52:58,060 --> 01:53:04,789
boosting up. Okay. Here we go. I'm going to do power on sword. Is there a special on the sword?

687
01:53:04,789 --> 01:53:16,279
There's not. Energy speed. Oh, there's special up here. 2% more energy speed. I'm all right with that.

688
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:35,239
All right. 11 billion attack. I can now hurt him, but he's doing way more to me. I think I'm just

689
01:53:35,239 --> 01:53:40,340
going to dump every point into one thing. Yeah. To do auto merge, I have to do the unlock. There's an

690
01:53:40,340 --> 01:54:02,539
unlock I have to actually do. It's just something for me to do at this point. Money pit. 44 minutes.

691
01:54:02,539 --> 01:54:11,960
That's counting slower. That's counting slower now. All right. 11 idle. Let's just put it up here.

692
01:54:13,539 --> 01:54:18,739
16 billion. Look, that's going up quick though. You know what? No. All of it goes in here. Put

693
01:54:18,739 --> 01:54:25,020
every single thing in here. I want that. I want to see this number jump. There we go. All right.

694
01:54:25,989 --> 01:54:34,729
I'm almost going to be doing double what you have in defense. You lied about hot lava.

695
01:54:35,989 --> 01:54:48,470
Not necessarily. I got addicted to this game. He just put on this OST. Give it some time.

696
01:54:49,109 --> 01:54:57,979
Yeah. I just put it on. The WarioWare for the Wii had a great soundtrack. So yeah, this will be on

697
01:54:57,979 --> 01:55:05,460
for a little while. That's fine. All right. Almost going to be two times, three times what he has.

698
01:55:13,130 --> 01:55:16,460
I haven't had a single clue what's going on this whole time. Let me fill you in.

699
01:55:18,939 --> 01:55:25,930
Up here, you have a bar that is constantly producing energy. When you get energy,

700
01:55:26,569 --> 01:55:32,569
you can use your energy. It's one point. See over here. One point will generate.

701
01:55:33,449 --> 01:55:41,939
I don't know how it works either. It generates a level. One point of energy makes a level,

702
01:55:42,739 --> 01:55:54,949
which increases this bar to increase your HP and your attack. And so now I'm using, I have 1045

703
01:55:54,949 --> 01:56:02,199
energy. I'm using all of it right now to do like to supercharge this. And now that I've done 5,000

704
01:56:02,199 --> 01:56:09,909
of these, I can do this now, which is just a better idea because this gives you more points

705
01:56:10,550 --> 01:56:17,020
per energy level. And then once you get to a certain, I have a thousand points in here.

706
01:56:18,550 --> 01:56:23,829
This is the defense section. So right now I don't have any, I don't have any,

707
01:56:25,340 --> 01:56:30,149
the mouse is out of sync. That is weird. Why is that happening?

708
01:56:30,149 --> 01:56:36,340
Okay. Right now my mouse is down in the lower lower right hand side of the screen.

709
01:56:36,340 --> 01:56:52,039
That's weird. I don't know why it's doing that. Jeremy, help my dog. It'll be all right. All

710
01:56:52,039 --> 01:56:57,300
right. So I'm just in the time that we've been talking, just in the time that we've been hanging

711
01:56:57,300 --> 01:57:07,529
out here, I've gotten 37 billion. This is the one. So then you take what you have done. You

712
01:57:07,529 --> 01:57:14,310
take the upgrades that you've done to your counting mechanism and you go over to the

713
01:57:14,310 --> 01:57:19,989
fighting screen. And then you, I've built up enough attack and HP where I now I'm stronger

714
01:57:19,989 --> 01:57:25,430
than this orc. And then you hit the fight button. And as you see, I call, I need to explain it better.

715
01:57:25,430 --> 01:57:30,310
I have 40 billion. Let's just say, I'm going to say round numbers. I have 40 attack. He has 10

716
01:57:30,310 --> 01:57:37,750
defense. Therefore I'm doing 30 attack to this orc per quadra second. Okay. That's how it works.

717
01:57:37,750 --> 01:57:46,069
I have seven defense and he has 20 offense. I am taking 14 worth of points per quadra second

718
01:57:46,069 --> 01:57:50,470
of damage. That's what you, that's how it works. So I'm trying to kill him faster than he can kill

719
01:57:50,470 --> 01:57:58,390
me. He can still kill me faster. I'm going to hold on to my points. My inventory is getting,

720
01:58:04,710 --> 01:58:11,109
okay. I can, it's the music's fucking me up because I feel like I want to press start.

721
01:58:11,109 --> 01:58:15,420
Like I feel like I'm just press start already. Get, move on to the next menu.

722
01:58:15,979 --> 01:58:23,939
Toughness is okay. I, by the way, if you choose, I, I, if you combine items, for instance, these

723
01:58:24,500 --> 01:58:33,880
chest plates, they, do you see the number here? Um, when you, when you combine these, for instance,

724
01:58:33,880 --> 01:58:38,039
when I drag this over here, the smelly chest, whatever it's called, it's splattered with some

725
01:58:38,039 --> 01:58:43,880
smelly. Yes. So you can combine them. I just did. And now this makes it a little bit better.

726
01:58:48,279 --> 01:59:04,140
Yeah. Why is this doing that? I'm so confused. I need power. Toughness. Yeah. I can do one more

727
01:59:04,140 --> 01:59:11,020
because I just upgraded the cube. That's it. This is maxed out. Time to move on to other products.

728
01:59:11,819 --> 01:59:18,890
Let's put it in here. Put the hat in. Power up the sword. All right. That's, that's all adventure.

729
01:59:18,890 --> 01:59:33,300
That's all I can do. I need to get this boss 17. Go. Got it. Got it. All right. Now I need to do

730
01:59:33,300 --> 01:59:45,529
this. I need way, I need to cap this out. We need more of this beat boss 10. This is pushing

731
01:59:45,529 --> 01:59:48,409
your way through. You encounter a small clearing in the forest to try to dash through, but barely

732
01:59:48,409 --> 01:59:52,569
make it halfway before rotting corpses begin clawing their way out of the earth. One week

733
01:59:53,210 --> 01:59:58,250
shuffling zombie inches towards you might as well have some fun. Okay. He's got a hundred billion

734
01:59:58,250 --> 02:00:04,680
attack. This one ain't going to go so well. Money pit 38 minutes. This is counting slow.

735
02:00:05,159 --> 02:00:17,739
I'm going to adventure. I need to get to 17. That ain't going to happen. It's been a week.

736
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:32,390
It's wake up. It's been a week. I got to refill that. I wanted a coffee. Trying to Google this

737
02:00:32,390 --> 02:00:43,640
game. Trying to Google this name. Uh, it's on steam. It's N G U space idle. Get it on steam

738
02:00:49,909 --> 02:00:59,350
six out of 22 more special weight. No, that's it. No, I can do it. Ooh, I finally got boots.

739
02:00:59,350 --> 02:01:04,550
Now I'm in, I'm in full leather Minecraft gear. Still have a wooden sword though. That's not good.

740
02:01:05,189 --> 02:01:11,000
This has to be trashed. So do these get these things out of here. Should I? Yeah. What am I?

741
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:23,369
I don't need these 34 accessory. Let's see power zero. It's all zero. All right. 50 billion attack

742
02:01:23,369 --> 02:01:30,199
almost there. I can almost hurt this guy. My defense needs to be much better. I have six

743
02:01:30,199 --> 02:01:45,899
points. All right. Why have I not been saving for this plus 10,000, 10,000. I thought it was 10.

744
02:01:50,920 --> 02:02:00,539
Oh my goodness. That opens up everything that makes it. Oh my God. All right. But it's too hard.

745
02:02:00,539 --> 02:02:14,439
Okay. Six. I need to get that higher 50 billion attack. Almost. What do you get for defense?

746
02:02:15,079 --> 02:02:26,789
It needs to be higher. It needs to be much higher. All right. Pull this back. We're going to do 50,

747
02:02:26,789 --> 02:02:31,989
50 split here. I got a thousand. We're going to do a thousand, 500, 500, 45. Let it work.

748
02:02:32,789 --> 02:02:42,010
Well, I do a Fortnite dance to Mario. Where's OST? Just kidding. What happened to the lava game?

749
02:02:42,010 --> 02:02:53,699
It's still available. What did the dev say? You can't buy the energy cap upgrades until

750
02:02:53,699 --> 02:03:15,050
you max out energy from rebirthing. Oh shit. I like that. I have to fill this before I lose

751
02:03:15,050 --> 02:03:21,640
my mind. You know, the tooth prick, that whole joke with the convention. The reason why that

752
02:03:21,640 --> 02:03:29,399
existed guys is because if I don't have something in my hands or in my mouth or something to hold,

753
02:03:30,039 --> 02:03:50,899
I go nuts. It's like, it like pacifies me. Otherwise I'd be like, I need it. You're having

754
02:03:50,899 --> 02:04:00,300
a fidget helps me too. I fidget a lot. That's why I'm like, I'm, you know what it is? I have,

755
02:04:00,300 --> 02:04:07,880
I have like NPC coded random actions that I just pull out for no reason. You know,

756
02:04:07,880 --> 02:04:11,079
when you go up to an NPC and like GTA and they're drinking out of a cup and it's empty and you're

757
02:04:11,079 --> 02:04:18,119
like, oh my God, what the fuck is that guy doing? You are watching somebody do that right now.

758
02:04:19,899 --> 02:04:32,569
This has been empty for an hour. I've got like GTA pedestrian wired brain up here.

759
02:04:33,369 --> 02:04:39,800
Go get a refill. I can't right now. I'm too busy. All right. Let's do some power. No, in the sword.

760
02:04:42,060 --> 02:04:55,930
I'm getting powerful this way. Toughness. You got it. What do we got? All right. Uh, money pit.

761
02:04:55,930 --> 02:05:08,439
33 minutes. I think it's ready. What do I got? 60 to 54, 42 to 100. Not quite max HP too much.

762
02:05:09,659 --> 02:05:20,710
No, I can't, I can't do it. Eight experience. I'm going to do energy power. I need 15 because

763
02:05:20,710 --> 02:05:39,590
that just makes everything better. I can do another rebirth coming up. What do I need? I need defense.

764
02:05:39,590 --> 02:05:45,220
I have enough attack to kill it. Training. Pull out of this. Put it all in defense. I just need

765
02:05:45,220 --> 02:06:35,060
more defense. Way more. 745, 300. Sounds good. What's the name of the game? I keep winning in

766
02:06:36,100 --> 02:06:49,239
Wario Kart and it's freaking me out. What color should I do? Just put it in the title. The title

767
02:06:49,239 --> 02:07:34,779
of the stream. His numbers go up. He's fuming. What does stream name stand for? I don't know.

768
02:07:35,420 --> 02:07:40,460
Fight boss. All right. Here we go. All right. Why are you where it's sick?

769
02:07:43,880 --> 02:07:51,210
This OST has a lot of tracks that are sort of just you completed a mini game and we're going

770
02:07:51,210 --> 02:07:56,250
to load a whole new soundtrack for it. Unreal tournament OST. Now that's too intense for me

771
02:07:56,250 --> 02:08:07,779
right now. All right. 60, 60 billion defense. We're almost ready. Katamari. Everybody loves

772
02:08:07,779 --> 02:08:13,880
Katamari. It always pops up during one of these streams. How are you guys doing today? You guys

773
02:08:13,880 --> 02:08:29,989
doing good? How are things? Things going good? No? Yeah? Yeah? Katamari OST. This is Katamari

774
02:08:29,989 --> 02:08:40,710
forever OST. I mean they're all good. You can kind of just pick whatever one you want. A little

775
02:08:40,710 --> 02:08:52,970
louder. This is the wrong one. It's the wrong one. All right. I need to do training here. We've got

776
02:08:52,970 --> 02:09:03,909
defenses. Good. It's time to only put it in the super strength one and I'm looking for enough

777
02:09:03,909 --> 02:09:11,460
attack. I'm looking for about a hundred. Because if I get a hundred billion attack that I can kill

778
02:09:11,460 --> 02:09:28,199
it and then we can rebirth. I might just rebirth now. Ten experience. Let's do, oh what a mess.

779
02:09:28,840 --> 02:09:39,159
Okay this orange is power. That's very important to know. I can do this in here. Special is still

780
02:09:39,159 --> 02:09:47,979
one more that can go in the cube and that is energy speed. Good. Special is, hold on, sword.

781
02:09:47,979 --> 02:09:55,960
Let's just combine them all. This is level 19 now. Cube. Into the cube. Right? Yeah. Cube into

782
02:09:55,960 --> 02:10:02,439
the cube. Special into the cube. Cube into the cube. Cube into the cube. Necklace onto the necklace.

783
02:10:02,439 --> 02:10:07,180
Boots onto the boots. I can do power in there again. All right. I'm looking pretty good.

784
02:10:17,270 --> 02:10:31,659
Shit. Cube into the cube. Cube into the cube. Yeah. This is a new thing. We unlock it.

785
02:10:32,380 --> 02:10:48,699
Break in the lake. I need more. What's rebirth gonna look like here? That's another huge increase.

786
02:10:49,579 --> 02:10:56,119
I love that there's a time factor as well to make sure you don't just spam it over and over again.

787
02:10:57,079 --> 02:11:07,930
I'm gonna wait till this gets to like 25,000. I think that's a good idea. If I were to say.

788
02:11:10,380 --> 02:11:19,270
Exponential increasing. I should rebirth. That number is huge. Oh yeah. I want to kill this guy

789
02:11:19,270 --> 02:11:24,939
first. I'm so close to being able to take this guy out. In fact I might be able to do it now.

790
02:11:25,819 --> 02:11:37,060
850. 60 to 100. It's gonna be close. He's winning. Stop. Stop. Stop. Not playing unsadistic.

791
02:11:46,439 --> 02:11:54,310
What a great game. I should play this. I already did. I should play all of them.

792
02:11:54,310 --> 02:12:01,560
Didn't I play two of them? I did. I should play the other ones. I'll do that next week.

793
02:12:02,119 --> 02:12:06,420
I'll play the other one. I'm gonna play like two or three or something. I'll do it next week.

794
02:12:06,979 --> 02:12:17,800
These games are phenomenal. Played reroll. Yeah, I did rerolled a few months ago actually, right?

795
02:12:18,520 --> 02:12:24,630
All right. This is it. Here we go. Come on. This is why we were sitting here for so long.

796
02:12:24,630 --> 02:12:31,989
Bring him down. Six. Six. Five. Five. Come on. Do it. Four. Bring him down to four.

797
02:12:33,640 --> 02:12:38,380
And then I rebirth. It's gonna do it. It's gonna do it. It's gonna do it. I'm almost ahead of him.

798
02:12:39,020 --> 02:12:58,739
Stick with it. Yes. Got it. Oh, and look at that rebirth. I wanted 25,000. We beat that boss.

799
02:12:59,539 --> 02:13:20,520
Sword. Sword up to 40k. Look at that. This guy's at five trillion health. Wait, I can do

800
02:13:20,520 --> 02:13:25,239
toughness and... Yeah, I can do it all in the cube. Just make that cube insane.

801
02:13:29,619 --> 02:13:44,550
This is boss 12. I'm... But look at all these points. Am I streaming tomorrow? Yeah,

802
02:13:44,550 --> 02:13:50,310
I'm streaming tomorrow. I was thinking about doing the community event tomorrow. Thinking

803
02:13:50,310 --> 02:13:55,829
about it. I was gonna... After the stream today, I was gonna go in and pull stuff out and see if

804
02:13:55,829 --> 02:14:02,920
there's enough there. If there's not enough for the community night tomorrow, then we're gonna play

805
02:14:02,920 --> 02:14:08,899
just... We'll play something else. What's the gold for? For right now, it's to throw into a hole.

806
02:14:10,939 --> 02:14:26,119
Maybe eventually I unlock something that's not just a money pit. I don't know. No, I'm not

807
02:14:26,119 --> 02:14:35,109
playing this tomorrow. I just wanted to check this out because I like watching numbers go up.

808
02:14:36,180 --> 02:14:40,340
I'm not gonna play this tomorrow. I'm not gonna... This is not gonna be the thing that I do for the

809
02:14:40,340 --> 02:14:58,140
next, like, six days. Just leave it on overnight. I still wanna play Hot Lava. After I rebirth,

810
02:14:58,140 --> 02:15:01,260
like, two or three more times, we're gonna play Hot Lava, and I'm gonna leave this on in the

811
02:15:01,260 --> 02:15:20,279
background. 42,000. It's going up so fast. You're the number one idol gamer on Twitch.

812
02:15:22,539 --> 02:15:26,890
I don't really want to be that person. I don't want to... I don't want to be that.

813
02:15:27,689 --> 02:15:37,779
It's like, one day, I'm just playing this idol game. It's just chatting with some extra steps

814
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:50,180
and music. Wait for 30 minutes. All right. All right. All right. All right. I'm gonna go refill.

815
02:15:51,060 --> 02:15:56,199
I'm gonna go refill. I'm just leaving it on, like, but there's no reason...

816
02:15:56,840 --> 02:16:09,029
Why do I need to go to the BRB screen? I'm gonna fill this up. I'm not gonna pause this. Now,

817
02:16:09,029 --> 02:16:15,819
you guys are idling. Yeah. He's never gonna play. I'm going to play Hot Lava before the stream ends

818
02:16:15,819 --> 02:16:22,340
tonight. I've only been streaming for, like, two and a half hours. You got plenty of time. Don't

819
02:16:22,340 --> 02:16:27,800
worry. All right. I'll be right back. I'm gonna refill. Just enjoy the music and enjoy the, uh,

820
02:16:27,800 --> 02:16:32,600
number going up for a little while. Wait. Hold on. Before I leave. I need to do this first.

821
02:16:33,319 --> 02:16:40,860
Rebirth. 44,000. 30 minutes. Let's see what happens as we get that time increase.

822
02:16:41,739 --> 02:17:10,059
1,283 energy. How much experience? 13. I'm gonna wait for this. Basic, uh, basic training.

823
02:17:10,780 --> 02:17:18,120
Let's just get... cap that out. Attack. Let's see. Holy shit. Look at each... each point. Each level

824
02:17:18,120 --> 02:17:31,190
is... is, like, 50 million? 40 million? Attack? Wow. Wow. All right. See you in, like, fucking five

825
02:17:31,190 --> 02:17:36,790
minutes. No. I'll be back in, like, two minutes. I'm just gonna get a refill. And then we're gonna

826
02:17:36,790 --> 02:17:42,889
play Hot Lava. I don't wanna... I don't wanna check games out, man. I'm just checking it out.

827
02:17:43,530 --> 02:17:59,319
We're just... I'm just checking it out. I'll be... Let me do one more thing, though. Hold on. One

828
02:17:59,319 --> 02:18:40,020
more thing. Before I leave. I gotta split this up. I gotta wait till it's, like, 150, 150. All right.

829
02:20:05,659 --> 02:20:50,100
What did I miss? What happened? What happened? What did I miss? Did I go up? Did I go up or

830
02:20:50,100 --> 02:21:00,579
down? How much? How many points do I have? 71 billion? Did I miss anything? Perfect. 75. 75.

831
02:21:00,579 --> 02:21:12,200
This is perfect. Money came out of the screen. I missed the fucking money? I hate that. I hate

832
02:21:12,200 --> 02:21:15,959
when you miss, like, the click on the screen for the free money. They used to do that shit. You

833
02:21:15,959 --> 02:21:25,719
guys remember that? How many of you guys remember the old 19, like, 99, 2000 year pop-up windows

834
02:21:25,719 --> 02:21:33,340
that tried to get you to claim checks that didn't exist? Click here. You have unclaimed money.

835
02:21:34,729 --> 02:21:40,600
Unclaimed money? Really? And you'd click it. And they would just fucking steal all your identity.

836
02:21:41,239 --> 02:21:49,850
You could... Do you remember the pop-ups would just launch at the screen? There was no pop-up

837
02:21:49,850 --> 02:21:55,770
blockers. There was no ad block. You got bombarded. You would have a window open here,

838
02:21:56,329 --> 02:22:00,409
right in front of you. And then behind that window, after one session of browsing,

839
02:22:01,129 --> 02:22:10,020
there would be 40 to 50 other windows that you didn't know were open. And yes, somebody just said

840
02:22:10,020 --> 02:22:17,139
it. A bunch of them were porn ads. They just, just, no shame at all. Just porn. They would

841
02:22:17,139 --> 02:22:25,299
just have open. Can you imagine browsing fucking the internet? It'd be, uh, mail and rebate, mail

842
02:22:25,299 --> 02:22:30,100
and rebate, mail and rebate. Claim your check. Claim your money. You have free money. Money,

843
02:22:30,100 --> 02:22:35,379
money, money. Porn, porn, porn, porn. That naked person on the screen. Two naked people on the

844
02:22:35,379 --> 02:22:43,590
screen. Holy shit. Okay. How did anybody even browse back then? I don't even remember. I don't have a

845
02:22:43,590 --> 02:22:48,709
memory of... I think it was just like normal. And you sat there going like this at the end of your

846
02:22:48,709 --> 02:22:57,430
browsing session. X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X. And they'd play sound too. So it would be

847
02:22:57,430 --> 02:23:04,170
like, yip, up, zip, yip, kip, hup, kip, hup, kip, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup. They were

848
02:23:04,170 --> 02:23:16,059
fucking horrible. What do I got? 145 billion. Let's do it. Should I just nuke? No, I don't want to.

849
02:23:16,059 --> 02:23:26,950
I don't like nuke. I like being able to see my progress. Goblin. Instantly. Orc. Done. Slow zombie.

850
02:23:28,629 --> 02:23:33,659
Remember how long and painful this was? Oh fuck, I have a ton of idle energy.

851
02:23:41,030 --> 02:23:53,750
There we go. Computers were just RuneScape machines. RuneScape machines. Faster. I'm

852
02:23:53,750 --> 02:24:05,479
trying to go faster. No, here's the wall. Okay. Experience. 19. We're going to do energy power

853
02:24:05,479 --> 02:24:11,979
here. Take a look up here. We got 237 billion. Approves the effectiveness of your allocated

854
02:24:11,979 --> 02:24:21,879
energy. This means faster progress on features while using less energy. Energy cap. I don't have...

855
02:24:23,399 --> 02:24:28,379
I think I have to hit... Once you have 100,000 max energy. I can't do it yet.

856
02:24:29,100 --> 02:24:41,190
Yeah, I can't do it yet. I need 100,000. Yeah, I can't do it. Play the deadly premonition OST.

857
02:24:45,079 --> 02:24:56,659
Didn't I play deadly premonition for like an hour? There's something in there now.

858
02:24:57,379 --> 02:25:05,750
It freaks me out for a second. Base energy cap. So, should I just wait? I'm just gonna wait.

859
02:25:06,549 --> 02:25:13,399
Can I kill you yet? Almost. What have I got? Basic training. More. In fact, no, no, no, no.

860
02:25:13,959 --> 02:25:27,049
Get it all in here. All 1200. Just until this gets to 5k. You didn't think this was gonna be the most

861
02:25:27,049 --> 02:25:54,250
fucking upbeat stream you've seen in a week. We're just bopping. What a cool streamer. I know the

862
02:25:54,250 --> 02:26:02,219
joke that if this is your first stream of mine, then you're gonna be like every stream. We just...

863
02:26:02,219 --> 02:26:10,899
I don't know. And you'll be fine. Hi, this is my first stream. What's up? Welcome to the channel.

864
02:26:15,610 --> 02:26:28,489
I was voted fourth most energetic Twitch streamer with under 500,000 followers.

865
02:26:41,819 --> 02:26:55,510
Why did you win that? Because I did. It's a pity award. It's not a pity award.

866
02:26:56,620 --> 02:27:10,120
It's an award. Weird flex, but okay. No, the weird part about that weird flex is it's a fake

867
02:27:10,120 --> 02:27:19,610
weird flex. Yeah, I was voted like 16th most energetic streamer on Twitch with

868
02:27:19,610 --> 02:27:29,049
followers between 200 and 51,000 and 251,000 and 14. I was voted number 14 on that list.

869
02:27:31,530 --> 02:27:42,069
Pretty good if you ask me. What? Why am I lying? I have a very important question for everybody

870
02:27:42,069 --> 02:27:51,819
watching right now. Important. When does a lie become a lie? Because if you say something that's

871
02:27:51,819 --> 02:28:00,139
not true and immediately it's corrected, is that a lie? I think a lie has to sit as if it were fact

872
02:28:00,139 --> 02:28:08,299
for at least one day. I think that's not a lie because I'm not trying to push it off as real.

873
02:28:09,020 --> 02:28:17,780
What is it 15 minutes? If I tell you that hey I won an award at TwitchCon for top 40

874
02:28:18,979 --> 02:28:26,100
funny faces and I didn't correct it and like four days went by, that's a lie. But if I told you,

875
02:28:26,979 --> 02:28:34,100
I bet you, no that's a bet. If I told you that I won that award and then 10 seconds later I said

876
02:28:34,100 --> 02:28:38,260
that's not real it's a fucking joke. When is a lie a joke and when is a joke a lie?

877
02:28:39,719 --> 02:28:56,489
No, a lie has to sit for 24 hours before it's a lie. I will stand by that. Untruth. Wait,

878
02:28:56,489 --> 02:29:01,450
hold on. I'm facing an ent. You haul ass and make it past the clearing managing to shake off most

879
02:29:01,450 --> 02:29:05,770
of those fast charging type zombies. After putting some more distance between you and them,

880
02:29:05,770 --> 02:29:09,690
you take a breather against a tree until it starts moving under you. God damn it.

881
02:29:10,569 --> 02:29:20,629
Yeah, I only lie for 23 hours at a time. I'm trying to think, have I ever told you guys like

882
02:29:20,629 --> 02:29:29,559
a true lie? Like a real one? One that sat for 24 hours that was me lying to you about something.

883
02:29:30,440 --> 02:29:35,959
You lied about Sam and Max. I didn't lie about Sam and Max. I played season three and didn't like

884
02:29:35,959 --> 02:29:46,600
it. I played something and didn't like it. That's a lie. You lied about Ace Attorney. Now I told you

885
02:29:46,600 --> 02:29:49,000
that I played Ace Attorney for a little bit off stream and I didn't think it was going to be a

886
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:52,280
stream I wanted to stream. A game I wanted to stream. That's not a lie. That's me coming to

887
02:29:52,280 --> 02:30:02,409
a conclusion and I told you that. You lied about Wailord. What'd you say? What did you say? I heard

888
02:30:02,409 --> 02:30:11,590
you. What are you saying? I still haven't watched that by the way. You took more than 24 hours to

889
02:30:11,590 --> 02:30:22,100
correct it. Wait, I gotta do stuff. Oh, fuck. I didn't take more than 24 hours to correct that.

890
02:30:22,899 --> 02:30:34,440
Wait, this is power. Max power. I'm gonna go over my inventory here and see what's better. Okay,

891
02:30:34,520 --> 02:30:39,799
three. This is good. Three. This accessory's not going anywhere. It's the noob cube. I'm not

892
02:30:39,799 --> 02:30:49,110
taking it off. Money. Eight minutes. Where's my gold? Oh, fuck. It's because I reset. All right,

893
02:30:49,110 --> 02:30:55,530
hold on. Training here. I need to do this. Hold this out. We gotta get this 5,000 as fast as

894
02:30:55,530 --> 02:31:04,969
possible. You lied about Monster Rancher 4. Did I though? Did I lie about Monster Rancher 4?

895
02:31:07,850 --> 02:31:12,809
Somebody just gave five community subs thanks to whoever did that. That was anonymous. Thanks to

896
02:31:12,809 --> 02:31:24,709
the five community subs. Just anonymous. Thanks a lot whoever you are. You lied about the definition

897
02:31:24,709 --> 02:31:36,969
of lying. What are you guys on about? What an incredible soundtrack to this video game.

898
02:31:40,680 --> 02:31:50,139
I wanted to stop playing this game an hour ago and move on to hot lava, but I can't because I

899
02:31:50,139 --> 02:32:04,680
have to see. I need to know. We'll do a long one tonight. How is that a lie? No, a lie is not a

900
02:32:04,680 --> 02:32:10,680
lie until it is something that you specifically are trying to push forward as a truth that sits

901
02:32:10,680 --> 02:32:21,030
in everybody's bellies for 24 hours. What's this game called? It's called. Look it up. It's on

902
02:32:21,030 --> 02:32:40,899
Steam. It's a lie. It's only a lie if you believe it. What? No, a lie. A lie is something that,

903
02:32:40,899 --> 02:32:47,299
a statement that you are making to try to push forward as a real thing or a truth that you want

904
02:32:47,299 --> 02:32:53,860
people to think is real that sits in their bellies for 24 hours and you continue to try to push the

905
02:32:53,860 --> 02:33:02,090
fact that it is real when it never was in the first place. Now I make mistakes, okay? Ace Attorney,

906
02:33:02,090 --> 02:33:06,329
me saying I was going to play Ace Attorney was a mistake. That's not a lie. It's a mistake.

907
02:33:07,049 --> 02:33:22,840
I make mistakes. I don't lie. All right, I'm almost there. I just want to play hot lava,

908
02:33:22,840 --> 02:33:29,340
but I fucking can't. I cannot. I can't do it. That means I have to hit the X here, but like I can't.

909
02:33:29,340 --> 02:33:41,350
My body won't do it. 25 trillion defense. All right, getting there. What do I got for rebirth here?

910
02:33:43,370 --> 02:33:50,649
150,000. I need 15 more minutes and that doubles. Switch monitors. I can't do that.

911
02:33:51,290 --> 02:34:01,799
No, I can't do that. No, I cannot. I can't. Watch the video of lies compiled. Nobody's made it.

912
02:34:01,799 --> 02:34:06,969
I said to make that a long time ago and nobody made it. I was like, if you want to call me out,

913
02:34:06,969 --> 02:34:12,329
I want a Jerma has lied video and a compilation of everything I've ever said that was a lie.

914
02:34:12,329 --> 02:34:24,059
I made that challenge and what do you know? I haven't seen it yet. There are too many.

915
02:34:25,020 --> 02:34:42,059
It's still uploading. It's very long. Okay. What even is this game?

916
02:34:50,020 --> 02:34:58,549
It's an ever-growing video. Did you ever do that Stardew co-op stream? No, because Stardew...

917
02:34:59,829 --> 02:35:04,540
All right, I have to play. I have to focus and get busy.

918
02:35:05,340 --> 02:35:11,260
22 experience. Almost getting close to 40. Go to my inventory. I'm not even on an adventure.

919
02:35:12,219 --> 02:35:26,260
Hurry them up. Wait, I'm going to say two. Two versus 1.3. Two versus... I need more defense.

920
02:35:26,260 --> 02:35:34,840
Let's get it up. Boys and girls, I need defense. Get it up. Come on. I need 10,000 in this to this.

921
02:35:34,840 --> 02:35:43,799
Never going to happen. Changing the subject. What do you mean? Make sure to unlock popping gamer.

922
02:35:46,729 --> 02:35:54,940
I already was gotten by that one, so you're not going to get me again. What track is this?

923
02:35:55,500 --> 02:35:59,260
I don't know. It's just the whole two and a half hour long OST.

924
02:36:02,010 --> 02:36:08,870
You lied about peeking your mic. I peeked my mic yesterday by screaming about a flashbang.

925
02:36:09,590 --> 02:36:21,670
Is it actually sick music? Yes, it is. Two minutes until I can throw money in there.

926
02:36:22,309 --> 02:36:38,809
All right, I'm going for it. Not going to be fast enough, but I need it. No, it's not going to happen.

927
02:36:38,809 --> 02:36:56,760
Stop. I need a little more attack. All right, enough. A little more attack. Cap it. Let's go.

928
02:37:00,149 --> 02:37:06,420
Just enough to give myself the edge here. You said two or three more rebirths before the

929
02:37:06,420 --> 02:37:20,229
lava game. I did one. Upcoming here is two, and then after that will be three. Bingo. What do we

930
02:37:20,229 --> 02:37:35,989
got? 179,000. Oh, and in 10 minutes, that's doubles. Double. What's it going to be at? 181.

931
02:37:37,030 --> 02:37:43,799
Boom. See you later. Giant. Entering this forest is feeling more and more like a bad idea. Even

932
02:37:43,799 --> 02:37:49,079
the air is starting to taste sort of odd, like copper and iron. You strained to keep an eye on

933
02:37:49,079 --> 02:37:52,920
the forest path with the haze thickening around you. You managed to keep on the path, but somehow

934
02:37:52,920 --> 02:38:04,819
also managed to bump right into a giant in front of you. Enjoy the fight. Who's Bob? He's got 12

935
02:38:04,819 --> 02:38:11,219
trillion attacks. That ain't going to work out. 375,000. We're just going to last another 10

936
02:38:11,219 --> 02:38:22,309
minutes. You lied about Flora's Lava. You haven't waited 24 hours yet. You haven't waited, because

937
02:38:22,309 --> 02:38:40,520
in like an hour, that's not going to be a lie. Oh, this is hot. I like this one. This is a hot

938
02:38:40,520 --> 02:39:01,610
track. Little did you guys think that fucking idle number counting stream is going to be the most

939
02:39:01,610 --> 02:39:14,299
lit stream you've been at all day. It's not a lie. It hasn't been 24 hours yet. You can go to like

940
02:39:14,299 --> 02:39:30,489
a music stream in about 45 minutes and it's not a lie. Please don't say lit. Say whatever I want.

941
02:39:31,129 --> 02:39:49,030
Lit is as bad as epic. I know epic is a whole nother tier. I think you can still say lit

942
02:39:49,030 --> 02:39:54,229
ironically as a joke and it's okay. Epic is like completely out of completely out of bounds now.

943
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:13,379
Epic is in a category on its own. All right, one more rebirth and I'm going to play hot lava

944
02:40:13,940 --> 02:40:16,979
and I'm going to keep this running in the background and we're going to check in on it

945
02:40:16,979 --> 02:40:29,030
every now and then. Seven and a half minutes countdown until floor is lava. Chat complaining

946
02:40:29,030 --> 02:40:33,430
about youth culture. You guys are the real boomers, but you guys are youth culture.

947
02:40:34,229 --> 02:40:40,520
I can see in my my analytics. You guys are youth culture. This is you.

948
02:40:41,479 --> 02:40:54,520
Not me anymore. I bet you still have cookie clicker running. I'm out of that category now

949
02:40:54,520 --> 02:41:04,200
as of my 34th birthday. Everyone here is in their 30s. What are you talking about?

950
02:41:05,530 --> 02:41:12,420
I, you know, I would assume there's probably a few 30 year olds here. How many people are here? Like

951
02:41:12,420 --> 02:41:23,459
4,400, 4,400 people. Maybe 2,500 30 year olds. All right, six minutes until I could rebirth and

952
02:41:23,459 --> 02:41:30,899
this is getting minimized and opening hot lava and I can stop getting just the outpour of fucking

953
02:41:30,899 --> 02:41:38,790
hate mail that's coming in through my PO box over here. The stack this high of letters telling me to

954
02:41:38,790 --> 02:41:59,750
change game. They just keep coming in using letters. Do not stop playing this game. I'm

955
02:41:59,750 --> 02:42:07,239
not going to stop playing this game. Just because I'm moving on to another game doesn't mean that

956
02:42:07,239 --> 02:42:18,360
this game stops because I've got news for you. Once I'm done playing, you don't speak during

957
02:42:18,360 --> 02:42:59,110
this track, by the way. I forget what I was going to say. I don't remember what it was. It was

958
02:42:59,110 --> 02:43:03,989
something important. Oh yeah, the game's going to be playing in the background while we play hot lava

959
02:43:03,989 --> 02:43:10,360
and then everyone that wants to see a different game today will do that and then we're coming

960
02:43:10,360 --> 02:43:17,979
back to this. This game might get closed. Still can't even fight this guy. What we got? Rebirth. We

961
02:43:17,979 --> 02:43:26,229
have four minutes. We're going to hit a million. One million. One million. One million. Money pit.

962
02:43:26,950 --> 02:43:56,420
Not yet. After I killed the giant. No. This is a bitcoin mining scam. This is a

963
02:43:57,379 --> 02:44:06,870
idle game that has a very passionate developer who has made tons of content in here. How dare you

964
02:44:08,120 --> 02:44:20,010
say something that much of a lie in 23 hours and 59 minutes? I demand an apology.

965
02:44:20,809 --> 02:44:36,059
Here comes a call out post. I'm never going to be able to do this. Hold on. Here it comes.

966
02:44:37,030 --> 02:44:43,209
And then after this, I just want to see what a million number points looks like. Why am I

967
02:44:43,290 --> 02:44:53,049
holding this? Have I showed you the book of our lord? Sir, if you have just one moment.

968
02:45:04,100 --> 02:45:24,469
Two minutes. Two minutes until we can play another game. Read the fucking book. This

969
02:45:24,469 --> 02:45:29,159
webcam is mirrored. Yeah, because if I wasn't mirrored I'd be looking over this way. No,

970
02:45:29,159 --> 02:45:33,079
I have to point the wrong way. So I have to point this way because it's mirrored. I'd be looking

971
02:45:33,079 --> 02:45:38,620
this way and I'd be looking at the video game screen with my board game. Look at all these

972
02:45:38,620 --> 02:45:51,079
things to unlock. All right. I'm going to take a look. Power. One, two, three. Money pit. Not yet.

973
02:45:51,079 --> 02:46:32,250
Here we go. This is going to be it. One minute. He's stalling. There's a countdown on the screen.

974
02:46:32,250 --> 02:46:40,170
It's not a stall. There's a 30, I have to burn 30 seconds here. The game is a stall.

975
02:46:41,860 --> 02:46:45,780
All right. Okay. Now I see what you're doing with this one. All right.

976
02:46:47,979 --> 02:46:57,340
Oh, one million coming up. One fucking million. Biggest number you've ever seen. I've ever seen

977
02:46:57,340 --> 02:47:12,379
my whole life. Okay. Now I just want to, I just want to know what it looks like. Somebody right

978
02:47:12,379 --> 02:47:19,000
now is in their chair just going like, get out of this fucking game. And I'm just sitting there

979
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:31,479
going, hey, I like this one. So you're like strapped to the chair. Get me out of this chair.

980
02:47:32,520 --> 02:47:38,739
I got this like tape and God, why do you look like Leon from Resident Evil? Cause I was the

981
02:47:38,739 --> 02:47:57,959
fucking face map for that game. All right. But we, I don't want to turn the music. This music is,

982
02:47:57,959 --> 02:48:04,420
I don't want to, I don't want to turn the music off. We can't wait, wait until the whole OST

983
02:48:04,420 --> 02:48:11,379
is done. In two hours. Wait till the OST is done in two hours and we'll play hot lava. That's a good

984
02:48:11,379 --> 02:48:22,729
enough, that's a good compromise. I think it's all about compromise. Kidding. But we do have to turn

985
02:48:22,729 --> 02:48:28,180
the music off. But I, hold on. Important. Let me get, let me clean this up first and then I'm

986
02:48:28,180 --> 02:48:32,500
going to let it run in the background while I jump from device to device and try to not land on the

987
02:48:32,500 --> 02:48:50,299
ground. Toughness. Special. Special. Toughness. Special. Toughness. Look, 27 points. Here comes

988
02:48:50,299 --> 02:49:01,530
the rebirth at 1.1 million. Do it. Go. I just want to see what it looks like. I forgot about the money.

989
02:49:02,090 --> 02:49:14,950
You have been immensely distracting me. It's okay. So I just need to know. Where's the cap now?

990
02:49:14,950 --> 02:49:24,229
1500 energy points. Nice. All right. I just want to see. How much is one point is worth? Two billion,

991
02:49:24,229 --> 02:49:38,420
three billion, four billion. We're already at billions? Holy shit. My head hurts. Take a couple

992
02:49:38,420 --> 02:49:42,860
aspirin. Or like acetaminophen. If you're sensitive to aspirin, take acetaminophen.

993
02:49:43,579 --> 02:49:50,149
Sensitive to that. Maybe grab like an aspirin or something. And take a break off the computer.

994
02:49:50,149 --> 02:49:53,690
You know, just take a break from the computer. If you're on the computer for too long,

995
02:49:54,329 --> 02:50:00,809
it irritates your skin. You know what I mean? You have to put on sunscreen. See what the problem I

996
02:50:00,809 --> 02:50:05,129
think is, is your screen brightness is so high, you're not wearing sunscreen. Like, come on.

997
02:50:06,540 --> 02:50:14,040
All right. Let's just go. I want to just clip through these. One, two, three, four, five, six,

998
02:50:14,040 --> 02:50:20,200
seven, eight, nine, ten. Without even doing anything. I just want to see. Trillion. Bring

999
02:50:20,200 --> 02:50:34,459
it down. This guy was a pain in the ass. What about if my nose hurts? Should I take a break

1000
02:50:34,459 --> 02:50:56,170
from breathing? You should breathe. Why am I not doing well? I just want to see. Uh oh. Right now.

1001
02:50:56,170 --> 02:51:14,329
Like, right now. Right now. When I just didn't go immediately to hot lava. The person that was

1002
02:51:14,329 --> 02:51:26,549
mad that I was still here. Like, the alarm sounded in their room. Hold on. It's like, wait, he's

1003
02:51:26,549 --> 02:51:34,059
still, he's still in the game. What's he still doing in the game? Why is he still in here?

1004
02:51:36,069 --> 02:52:01,399
What are you doing in here? Okay. So what happened there? Um, I went a little too hard.

1005
02:52:01,399 --> 02:52:15,610
I went, I went a little too hard. I kind of like made myself a little dizzy. I went too hard. I

1006
02:52:15,610 --> 02:52:25,239
was like bracing and pushing blood into my head. And what the fuck was that? He pooped his pants.

1007
02:52:27,540 --> 02:52:44,379
That would be a real alarm that I would have to leave if that happened. Hold on. I'm good.

1008
02:52:58,760 --> 02:53:13,319
Only 295 rebirth points? What? Oh, I'm supposed to leave. Right. I'm supposed to leave. All right.

1009
02:53:13,319 --> 02:53:21,879
Let me just get, I need to get to my cap. Okay. That's important. Let me get to the cap. Let me,

1010
02:53:21,879 --> 02:53:29,159
I just, let me get to the cap. I just need to get to the cap. Calm down. Turn it off. Don't worry.

1011
02:53:29,159 --> 02:53:40,299
You're gonna get your lava video game. Oh fuck. Adventure. Right. Idle it. I'm, I'm going, I'm good.

1012
02:53:41,100 --> 02:53:49,690
In the sewers. I want lava. I want lava. I want lava. You'll get it. Why do I have an artifacting

1013
02:53:49,690 --> 02:53:56,250
on my webcam? Why does my webcam look, it's like underwater. That's weird. Lava video game now.

1014
02:53:56,250 --> 02:54:06,569
Lava video game now. Lava video game now. Just wait. I need to get my cap so I can be running

1015
02:54:06,569 --> 02:54:12,729
in the background. You know how many rebirth is the continuation multipliers are going to exist

1016
02:54:12,729 --> 02:54:28,760
after like playing the lava game for 20 minutes? We want numbers. Shit. Hold on. All right. I got

1017
02:54:28,760 --> 02:54:44,780
to, let me, I need to get to 12 or 1500. I am very close to doing a 10k. Let me slow you down a

1018
02:54:44,780 --> 02:54:56,920
little. Let me just like even you up. Let's see. We're gonna melt faster than the lava. What can

1019
02:54:56,920 --> 02:55:07,100
he say? The guy likes numbers going up. Thank you. To that person. You get it. You get it. I just,

1020
02:55:07,100 --> 02:55:23,190
I like it. You get it. Tree dead. Giant. Let me just be the giant and we'll go and I'm actually

1021
02:55:23,190 --> 02:55:27,909
going to minimize it. You can, you watch me. I'm going to click the minimize and I'm going to open

1022
02:55:27,909 --> 02:55:54,569
hot lava. I'm going to laugh my ass off if hot lava is a bad game. At least it's a game. What's

1023
02:55:54,569 --> 02:56:02,979
this then? You can make a game out of anything. Guys, I could make a game out of sit like 10 or

1024
02:56:03,620 --> 02:56:06,979
do you go to like preschool? You can make, who can count to 10 the fastest?

1025
02:56:08,459 --> 02:56:14,280
That's a game. I'm going to throw this cup in the air and catch it. I'm going to make up a game

1026
02:56:14,280 --> 02:56:24,180
called throw the cup in the air and catch the cup. I just played a game. I mean, you can make a game

1027
02:56:24,180 --> 02:56:30,200
than anything. How about leak all photos? That's a game. Leak all photos, personal photos to my

1028
02:56:30,200 --> 02:56:55,399
Twitter. I mean, that's a game. Wait. All right. We're almost there. I got it. I'm eating spit.

1029
02:56:57,500 --> 02:57:04,170
There we go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, more of this. I just got to get to a point where I can

1030
02:57:04,170 --> 02:57:12,920
beat it. All right. Cap that up. All right. We are going. What? I have to beat the giant. The giant

1031
02:57:12,920 --> 02:57:21,110
is boss 14. Thank you. Quack. Thank you. Quack up for the five community subs. Thank you. Quack.

1032
02:57:21,110 --> 02:57:32,469
We're good. But thank you. Quack. I have to beat this guy. Just give me a minute. Rebirth 20,000.

1033
02:57:32,549 --> 02:57:41,399
Not bad. Not good. Not great. Pull this down. More into here. Just dump every point. I'm at

1034
02:57:41,399 --> 02:57:51,110
almost the cap. 15, 15. What does he have for? Oh, my inventory. Fuck. Cubes. How many cubes

1035
02:57:51,110 --> 02:57:58,819
are there? How many times can I merge the cube? 69 accessory. LOL. Oh, huh. What's this at? 64,

1036
02:58:03,750 --> 02:58:19,770
69. Yeah. This is special. I mean, energy speed is important. 35. I have 16. His defense is

1037
02:58:19,770 --> 02:58:26,469
not good. I just need to have some more. Um, I have to have more defense. That'll help. Equip

1038
02:58:26,469 --> 02:58:38,469
the poop. If I hear the word poop one more time, I am going to be very, very, very angry. Here it

1039
02:58:38,469 --> 02:58:43,350
comes. Now we're all going to write it. Right? That's, that's the joke, right? Streamer says the

1040
02:58:43,350 --> 02:58:49,430
thing. Don't do this. Oh, if I hear that again. You guys do this one more time and then everybody

1041
02:58:49,430 --> 02:59:04,360
does it. You won't be hearing anything because the chat is audio. Is it not audio? Here we go. Uh,

1042
02:59:04,360 --> 02:59:11,510
I should be able to do it now. Come on. Drain, drain, drain, drain, drain, drain, drain, drain.

1043
02:59:11,510 --> 02:59:25,420
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5. Almost there. Get this up. All right. I'm at the cap. We're almost going to

1044
02:59:25,420 --> 02:59:32,569
minimize this game. We're going to minimize this and right behind it is going to be Doki Doki Literature

1045
02:59:32,569 --> 02:59:59,909
Club. Look at this shit eating grid. Done. Okay. I got it. Now all we have to do is allocate our

1046
02:59:59,909 --> 03:00:13,420
points correctly. I have 1550. I want like, fuck, 700, 800 here. I want like 800, 750 here. Good.

1047
03:00:13,420 --> 03:00:18,219
We're going to let this run in the background. I'm going to kill this guy. He's now going to be dead.

1048
03:00:18,219 --> 03:00:26,139
The giant has been vanquished. Rat of unusual size is the next boss. Okay. How many rebirth

1049
03:00:26,139 --> 03:00:34,229
points did that get me? Not very many, but enough. Now we wait. We sit. I clean up my inventory

1050
03:00:35,399 --> 03:00:41,350
and then we upgrade everything. This is at full toughness. Not anymore. Now I can do another one.

1051
03:00:43,180 --> 03:00:52,940
Go into here. All right. Let it run in the background. See, I'm a man of my word. We're

1052
03:00:52,940 --> 03:01:04,500
going to play hot lava. All right. Hold on. Just give me one sec. I need to like not capture this.

1053
03:01:05,139 --> 03:01:12,360
Okay. It might be loud. I'm just going to warn you because I can't turn it off right now.

1054
03:01:13,260 --> 03:01:17,659
And this music is also going to be turned off as well because there's music in hot lava.

1055
03:01:17,659 --> 03:01:23,860
I have to change the name of the title of the game to hot lava. Wait, this is on steam. Can I

1056
03:01:23,860 --> 03:01:34,409
not, can I run two games on steam at the same time? Wait, you can. I thought, wait, can you,

1057
03:01:34,409 --> 03:01:39,690
I thought maybe back. Let's try. See what happens. It's going to be loud. It's going to be loud. It's

1058
03:01:39,690 --> 03:02:51,260
going to be loud. Hold on. I'll turn it off. Right. Okay. Oh fuck. I'm sorry. There. Should I even move

1059
03:02:51,260 --> 03:02:58,700
the camera? Whatever. I'm already in that same spot. All right. Let's go. This is hot lava. It's

1060
03:02:58,700 --> 03:03:52,170
a game about parkouring. This just looks like I'm like a stock trader and I'm so obsessed with

1061
03:03:52,170 --> 03:03:56,329
keeping up to date on like the tickers and the, and the ups and downs that I have to have it on

1062
03:03:56,329 --> 03:04:05,530
the screen. I can't miss anything. I am a forex trader. What if it goes down by 0.2 cents and I

1063
03:04:05,530 --> 03:04:20,549
don't fucking sell it. All right. Let's do it. You have no friends. Gym class. I don't know how any

1064
03:04:20,549 --> 03:04:37,579
of this works. I can't hear. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I got to hold on. I got to turn

1065
03:04:37,579 --> 03:04:52,440
the, uh, that, uh, okay. That's all right. That's not terrible. No, no, no, no, no. Don't discard.

1066
03:04:53,239 --> 03:05:07,860
Okay. Uh, how do I, okay. So WASD. Am I crouching? How many milliseconds? Milliseconds?

1067
03:05:08,579 --> 03:05:13,610
Somebody just got killed. What do you mean somebody got killed? There's no lava yet.

1068
03:05:13,610 --> 03:05:34,139
Is there a sprint? No. Uh, what do I need to do? Is this teaching me how to play? I think this is

1069
03:05:34,940 --> 03:05:41,209
a, all right. Trampoline trouble. Oh, it's like Mario. It's like Super Mario when you

1070
03:05:41,209 --> 03:05:54,729
go through the painting. All right. What's this one? Gym Jam. Make your way to the gym and we'll

1071
03:05:54,729 --> 03:06:08,889
run through some basics of the game. All right. Let's go. All right. Monka S. How do I play?

1072
03:06:10,340 --> 03:06:17,020
Don't touch the lava. Who are you? Wait, this is a multiplayer game.

1073
03:06:17,739 --> 03:06:33,850
Press action to skip. I went into the lava. There are people in this game.

1074
03:06:36,260 --> 03:06:47,020
Swing like Indy. I know you wanna. Jump to grab ropes and pipes. All right. That's cool.

1075
03:06:47,659 --> 03:06:57,530
What's next? That person, that person's hacking. Oh, there's a pipe. Crouch or jump to get off of

1076
03:06:57,530 --> 03:07:08,069
a pipe. Hold forward when jumping to launch forward. Easy. I still have, wait what? Swing

1077
03:07:08,069 --> 03:07:34,840
on the bars. Swing with forward and back. So I can go like this. Jump at the correct time

1078
03:07:34,840 --> 03:07:40,229
on the trampolines to go hot. When you jump on the, jump on the trampoline at the correct time.

1079
03:07:40,229 --> 03:07:49,370
What do you mean the correct time? Oh, I see. Like you just have to jump on it like that and like

1080
03:07:49,370 --> 03:08:00,600
that. Moss. Putty is sticky. Use it to jump off walls. Oh, keep looking straight ahead to keep

1081
03:08:00,600 --> 03:08:06,950
your momentum so it's like a surf. Oh, all right. That's cool. You can slide a short distance when

1082
03:08:07,030 --> 03:08:24,260
stuck to a wall. Sick. How are these people in my game? Oh, is this a checkpoint or something?

1083
03:08:25,059 --> 03:08:39,940
They're just ghosts. What do you mean ghosts? Should I go this way? Whoa, the hell? I got the

1084
03:08:39,940 --> 03:08:48,969
golden pin. I got the golden pin. I found a golden pin. So this is a slider. Oh shit. Okay. Is that

1085
03:08:48,969 --> 03:09:28,659
speed? What's on the bottom? Oh, this way. Okay. Got it. I'm going too far. Oh shit. Got it. This

1086
03:09:28,659 --> 03:09:36,760
is actually pretty fun. Rank two. New character available. New world available. Playground.

1087
03:09:37,319 --> 03:09:47,909
Playful Nya Nya. Watermelon. Nature's candy. Slow clap. Bravo. A martial artist. Must have

1088
03:09:47,909 --> 03:09:59,530
one for taking down the bad guys. I did it. He's trying so hard. Me?

1089
03:10:04,860 --> 03:10:29,159
Okay. I unlocked trampoline trouble. That's 3.2 million coming up. All right. For a second,

1090
03:10:29,159 --> 03:10:42,040
I thought it was still on the screen. Okay. So let's go to the next one over here. He's addicted

1091
03:10:42,040 --> 03:10:47,850
to the idle game for today. I'll never play it ever again after today. All right. Trampoline

1092
03:10:47,850 --> 03:11:00,760
trouble. This is the first real test. And that was pathetic. That was just pathetic. You can throw it

1093
03:11:00,760 --> 03:11:05,879
further than that. Seriously. All right. Does it, does it count if it's not a basketball?

1094
03:11:06,520 --> 03:11:17,719
I don't need the achievement. I don't care. Oh, this is count. Time is counting right now.

1095
03:11:23,459 --> 03:11:45,510
Up. Up. Well, no, there's no players in here anymore. Turn off the piano. You want to turn

1096
03:11:45,510 --> 03:12:08,389
the music off. I don't know where the fuck it is. Where'd it go? That way? Uh, what was that? Oops.

1097
03:12:10,629 --> 03:12:19,110
Trampolines. One. Two. Switch the screens. One? Are we talking about switch? One?

1098
03:12:19,909 --> 03:12:25,079
What do you mean switch? What are you saying? What are you going to switch my screen?

1099
03:12:26,420 --> 03:12:32,739
How is this worse than the number game? I told you. I told you that this was going to happen.

1100
03:12:45,829 --> 03:13:07,190
I told you. I can play this game in the corner. I, just give me like 20 minutes.

1101
03:13:08,469 --> 03:13:28,979
Just split screen it. Do a, like an old co-op game. Who's playing the piano? I don't know.

1102
03:13:28,979 --> 03:13:54,969
Complete it in under a minute. I'll try it. Go. One minute. Gah! What the fuck? Oh, right.

1103
03:13:55,690 --> 03:14:48,899
Cross. Second trampoline. Watch this. It's a tricky jump. There it is. Turn it across. Bingo.

1104
03:14:48,899 --> 03:15:17,879
Last one. Did it. What? What are you showing me here? It keeps doing the face. This is a new

1105
03:15:17,879 --> 03:15:50,260
emotion. My fucking God. I did not look like that. Do I look like this? Holy shit. I'm being like,

1106
03:15:50,260 --> 03:16:01,540
sucked into a tube. I'm being sucked into a fucking, like, tunnel. Oh, all you need is to

1107
03:16:01,540 --> 03:16:20,149
have like, air sounds. Like, look at this photo and listen to this shit. What the fuck, man?

1108
03:16:20,709 --> 03:16:26,229
This is why I don't have face cam turned on. Ever. Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever. And I mean,

1109
03:16:26,229 --> 03:16:46,620
ever. Because I just look like a fucking sicko. All right, what was I doing? Right, over here.

1110
03:16:47,579 --> 03:16:53,340
I don't know. I looked over at my OBS and I saw that huge yellow and orange explosion. I thought

1111
03:16:53,340 --> 03:16:58,459
that was a huge bit thing. I thought that was like 10,000 bits. I was about to thank somebody.

1112
03:16:59,420 --> 03:17:19,129
All right. Let me add this. This is the noise that I hear when I see this image.

1113
03:17:27,270 --> 03:17:47,479
No! No, please no! I don't want to get sucked up! Thanks for that image. I won. Over here. What

1114
03:17:47,479 --> 03:18:00,219
I got for rebirth? 8.6 fucking million. Holy shit, my neck. I, I know, man. I know.

1115
03:18:01,020 --> 03:18:05,959
Wait, let me just make sure this is all good. Okay, not good yet. This gives more training.

1116
03:18:07,020 --> 03:18:15,479
Okay, spend experience. 44, 10k. Guys, I need to make this bigger so you can see,

1117
03:18:15,479 --> 03:18:25,350
because it's important to me. This is important to me. Important to me. Why is it still taking

1118
03:18:25,350 --> 03:18:46,600
over my computer? What the fuck are you talking about? I'm about to do 10,000 energy. Just kidding.

1119
03:18:47,239 --> 03:18:53,979
What do I do? I have 44 experience. What do I do? Put both games in the corner. No,

1120
03:18:54,700 --> 03:19:17,399
I'm going to do base energy. Energy speed. Good. All right, back to what I was doing.

1121
03:19:21,879 --> 03:19:27,500
Keep it like that. No, I'm not going to keep it like that. Let's go. I got the sculpted

1122
03:19:27,500 --> 03:19:35,579
plastic construction means no mustache wax required item. All right, so that was good.

1123
03:19:38,579 --> 03:19:51,590
Missing, where's the music? Okay, save those changes. All right, I want to, I want to,

1124
03:19:51,590 --> 03:19:55,829
want to, want to, want to, what do I want to do? Open gym, do whatever you want. Run, jump, swing.

1125
03:19:56,629 --> 03:20:03,270
Completed in under two minutes and 10 seconds. Don't die. Let's five star this shit.

1126
03:20:04,790 --> 03:20:16,040
No dying. Off the ladder. That's going to happen again. I need to like, I need to control my face.

1127
03:20:17,000 --> 03:20:37,909
I know it's going to happen again. Got to be slow. This one. Two minutes, right? I can do that.

1128
03:20:37,909 --> 03:20:54,120
That's easy. What the fuck I was grabbing onto it. Last try. What's this game called?

1129
03:20:58,090 --> 03:21:17,129
That person just fucked me up. That person just screwed me up. I can do this. Just do it simple.

1130
03:21:17,129 --> 03:21:25,819
Two minutes is a long time. This is like the mousepads coming off of the goddamn thing.

1131
03:21:31,059 --> 03:22:54,809
I know, get off the screen. My momentum is gone. Skip. I was right here too. God, come on. New

1132
03:22:54,809 --> 03:23:10,100
unlock. What are these? What do they do? These unlocks? I'm using a default avatar.

1133
03:23:10,979 --> 03:23:17,690
Yeah, I'm not, I don't, I'm not paying for it. Just don't die. I don't just beat it at any time.

1134
03:23:17,690 --> 03:23:44,579
Just don't die. Do it slow. Hair is getting in my face. How am I making it worse? Who the fuck is

1135
03:23:44,579 --> 03:24:17,000
this? Wait, is that me? I got to beat this motherfucker. Got it. Oh, he got confused over

1136
03:24:17,000 --> 03:24:40,170
there. No deaths. No deaths and beat the time. How are we doing on the idle game? That was me.

1137
03:24:40,170 --> 03:24:58,040
I got a thumbtack. 120. Now start strafing and bhopping. I think you're asking a little much.

1138
03:24:59,579 --> 03:25:12,100
Wait, 43 million. Another 10 minutes here. All right, that's good. Fight the boss. Fight it.

1139
03:25:12,100 --> 03:25:17,979
I can't fight it yet. Keep it going. Keep it going. What about inventory? Oh, not good. Hold on. Just

1140
03:25:17,979 --> 03:25:26,299
combine everything really quickly. Hat. Hat. Into here. Here. Here. Sword. Boots. Cube.

1141
03:25:27,739 --> 03:25:38,790
Toughness. Cube. Ring. Ring. 64. Combine. I got to combine the swords up here. One. Toughness.

1142
03:25:38,790 --> 03:25:43,030
No, that's special. I can do this once more. Special is already, is there any more specials

1143
03:25:43,030 --> 03:25:53,479
I can do? Yep. The hat. Speed bonus. Looking good. Pants. Cube. Keep it going. We're done. I'm ready.

1144
03:25:58,520 --> 03:26:07,500
Prank caller. Is somebody prank calling me? What do you mean? Do a third game in another window.

1145
03:26:09,799 --> 03:26:12,760
I can't. No, I'm not going to be able to do that. All right. I got to go over here and

1146
03:26:12,760 --> 03:26:19,799
get five stars on this one. I'm pretty good at this game, I think. I don't even know. I don't

1147
03:26:19,799 --> 03:26:24,760
know what the... What are the... Don't perform any swings. Don't die and grab the golden pin.

1148
03:26:26,809 --> 03:26:40,360
No swinging. What the fuck am I supposed to do that? No swinging? And don't die. My profile picture.

1149
03:26:40,360 --> 03:26:47,500
Yeah, my profile picture is an awesome way to hide online. Golden pin is probably the home line.

1150
03:26:47,500 --> 03:27:08,659
Because that... That's a default Team Fortress 2 avatar. Oh, I can't land on that. I have to do

1151
03:27:08,659 --> 03:27:34,780
like that. Oh, wrong. Just don't swing. Don't swing. Okay. I didn't swing. I'm just trying

1152
03:27:34,780 --> 03:28:12,299
to get one of them. No swings. Didn't say anything about bouncing, right? New world school.

1153
03:28:13,930 --> 03:28:26,379
Okay, I'm gonna go to my avatar and do some stuff. It's the same image. You just stretch

1154
03:28:26,379 --> 03:28:39,209
the sides of my mouth. I have to rebirth this in... When this gets to 60 minutes, I'm doing rebirth.

1155
03:28:39,209 --> 03:28:44,010
And then I'm changing over here. We're gonna do the same thing. We just... Now this one will be

1156
03:28:44,010 --> 03:28:53,909
in the corner. This one will be bigger. Not now yet. Not yet. Not now. You've got so many emotes.

1157
03:28:53,909 --> 03:28:59,270
I don't even know what I would call that. What would you... What would that emote even be called?

1158
03:28:59,270 --> 03:29:22,260
Dermatube? Dermassuction? Dermassour? I can't like... I like... Dermassour is the best one.

1159
03:29:24,309 --> 03:29:31,049
All right. I'm gonna... It's gonna be there tomorrow. I have 24 hours to do that. All right.

1160
03:29:31,049 --> 03:29:36,200
Back to the boss. Okay. I don't... You guys don't even... You don't need to see this shit.

1161
03:29:37,079 --> 03:29:41,959
It's taken away. You can see... I want you to go... This was the time. All right. New zone. Wait. I

1162
03:29:41,959 --> 03:30:05,139
want to go to the... Menu? Yeah. Toy shelf. Lex Flora. All right. We're doing the seagull head.

1163
03:30:05,780 --> 03:30:17,030
Moustache pin. Thumbs down. Blue laser. I don't have it. Watermelon in the background. Sounds good.

1164
03:30:21,510 --> 03:30:27,879
Let's go! Playground. Gym class. There's a lot of fucking stuff in this game, huh?

1165
03:30:31,180 --> 03:30:53,100
Damn. That's been debunked. Why is the camera mirrored? Because we were playing a different

1166
03:30:53,100 --> 03:30:57,420
game before and it had to be mirrored as I was looking in the right spot. All right. New place

1167
03:30:57,420 --> 03:31:09,510
unlocked. Where is it? I got five in there. Not gonna get five up there. This way? Which is the

1168
03:31:09,510 --> 03:31:23,129
level? Didn't I unlock it down here? There we go. What's the yellow bar at the bottom? I don't know.

1169
03:31:23,850 --> 03:31:35,530
I don't know. Balance? Maybe it's balance. Jump timing? Wait. You mean like...

1170
03:31:36,489 --> 03:31:55,879
You actually do bunny hop. Well, that's advanced techniques you're not gonna get on this screen.

1171
03:31:55,879 --> 03:32:22,360
Sorry. Almost. I think you gotta do that though. From here to here? And then twice?

1172
03:32:23,000 --> 03:32:33,239
No. All the way across. Yeah. Okay. I guess that is advanced technique. Wait. Is there something

1173
03:32:33,239 --> 03:32:49,260
over here? Did I skip the whole thing? I think I skipped the whole level. Just win. I'm trying.

1174
03:32:49,979 --> 03:33:17,659
I'm trying to just win. This used to be a numbers going upstream. Feels bad, man.

1175
03:33:19,190 --> 03:33:29,159
Yeah. Fist bump. It's still going on in the background. We'll be checking in on it soon.

1176
03:33:32,469 --> 03:33:41,850
God. I missed that game. Grab the golden pin. I can't do that. So a new session over here.

1177
03:33:42,649 --> 03:33:48,120
What do I do to get this? Requirement beads. Surfing surfaces. Oh, this one's gonna be held.

1178
03:33:48,760 --> 03:34:18,420
Pogo? Pogo stick? So it's not just jumping. There's items too. Wait. Shit. This is weird.

1179
03:34:24,620 --> 03:34:43,049
Whoa. That was fun. Easy mode. Celebrate your minor victory. So I'm assuming I need to use that

1180
03:34:43,049 --> 03:34:51,079
somewhere else. So this is a sliding level. Use the sliding surfaces. I keep seeing that picture

1181
03:34:51,079 --> 03:35:04,709
over here and it's freaking me the fuck out. Oh, fuck. Landing on surf objects from higher

1182
03:35:04,709 --> 03:35:15,209
makes you go faster. Right? What? Oh, I'm bunny hopping now. He figured it out, folks.

1183
03:35:19,940 --> 03:35:33,059
Damn. That was crazy. Flick away from objects to disconnect and keep your speed.

1184
03:35:33,940 --> 03:36:01,860
Flick away from objects. Flick away. Flick it in your hand. There we go.

1185
03:36:01,860 --> 03:36:18,489
People are going to get really good at something like this. Wholesale.

1186
03:36:19,209 --> 03:36:35,500
Clown shoes. Better put those on immediately. Hole bulb. What else is over here? This opened up.

1187
03:36:36,219 --> 03:36:47,690
Oh, what's this? Tiny toy trial. Get to the finish line. Tiny toy. If you're good at something,

1188
03:36:47,690 --> 03:37:01,799
they would do it for free. I agree. We're in third person? That was a battery. Oh, I get speed.

1189
03:37:02,600 --> 03:37:45,879
Do I have to do this in a certain amount of time? No. The music is playing based on my speed. That

1190
03:37:45,879 --> 03:38:22,549
is cool. I need to go faster though. No. I got to start back here. Got it. Was this the don't

1191
03:38:22,549 --> 03:38:35,340
starve devs? Really? That's kind of interesting. That's cool. Whoa. Did you see? He went so fast.

1192
03:38:36,219 --> 03:38:44,379
Do that again. Do that again every day. Five times a day. All right. Pole ball.

1193
03:38:44,379 --> 03:39:11,819
So here are the poles. And how do I? Oh, shit. What? How do I just stand on top?

1194
03:39:24,600 --> 03:39:59,610
And he's been drinking. I haven't. I've been drinking coffee. This is why I can't have a

1195
03:39:59,610 --> 03:40:10,059
face cam on. I'm too strange. I can feel how strange I'm being. But before I wouldn't care

1196
03:40:10,059 --> 03:40:30,739
because I wouldn't be on camera. Becoming odd. I'm unlocking worlds. I'm doing a whole lot of good

1197
03:40:30,739 --> 03:40:49,020
here. Cowboy hat. Knapsack. Dragon horns. Chase your sister. I can do that in a minute and 10

1198
03:40:49,020 --> 03:42:15,780
seconds. Break through. No deaths either. What the fuck is in my way? Did I do it? I didn't lose to

1199
03:42:15,780 --> 03:43:03,750
the ghost. I didn't get it. Minute and 10 seconds. Get the fuck in there. Restart. Trying to go too

1200
03:43:03,750 --> 03:44:18,010
fast. Get it! Okay. God damn it. I fucking hit my face. I got a minute and 10. Three seconds to spare.

1201
03:44:20,819 --> 03:44:27,780
All right. I got three out of that one. What's chasing my sister down here? All right. This

1202
03:44:27,780 --> 03:44:32,180
one's called chase your sister. This is called intermediate difficulty. Okay. Try to catch me.

1203
03:44:32,739 --> 03:44:59,299
This one's hard. Go for the hard one. When do we start? I had it too. I was doing pretty well.

1204
03:44:59,620 --> 03:45:05,959
Come on. Up. Over. I gotta land these bunny hops better too.

1205
03:45:07,100 --> 03:45:32,649
Fucking idiot. I'm so mad. Did he have a meltdown already? No. No meltdowns tonight.

1206
03:45:46,309 --> 03:45:49,430
All right. All right. Stop paying attention to the fucking bunny hop. You're never gonna get it.

1207
03:45:49,430 --> 03:47:27,399
Fuck it. Just go. She was waiting for me to taunt me. Cry. Cry. Cry. Cry. Cry. Oh, I think he's gonna

1208
03:47:27,399 --> 03:47:48,250
fucking cry. What the fuck am I doing? You're like half the bunny hop otherwise you can't make that

1209
03:47:48,250 --> 03:48:39,209
jump. Go back to the numbers game. Fuck. It's counting in the background. It's gotta focus

1210
03:48:39,209 --> 03:50:08,020
completely. No talking. No streaming. Just do it. Damn it. All right. If I try to bunny hop one more

1211
03:50:08,020 --> 03:50:37,899
time I am just just go. Just do it. I'm not going. No. Just do it. It probably on camera looks like

1212
03:50:37,899 --> 03:50:46,299
I'm trying to get a piece of popcorn out of my fucking teeth at the movie theater. Like I'm making

1213
03:50:46,299 --> 03:51:30,680
fucking jokes. This is the one right here. Flashy. Itchy nose. Inside of my nose is itching like

1214
03:51:30,680 --> 03:52:12,569
crazy. I just snorted itching powder. Somebody said who the fuck are you? Oh no. Now I can't lose

1215
03:52:12,569 --> 03:52:37,579
because this person's gonna show me up. Look at that. Great head. They fell. They fell. They fell.

1216
03:52:37,579 --> 03:52:54,629
Okay. Now I don't feel bad. It was that easy. That was not even that hard. I made that way harder

1217
03:52:54,629 --> 03:53:12,149
on myself. He was literally pretending. Did you see the other guy fall? Pretending. The guy in

1218
03:53:12,149 --> 03:53:34,780
front of me too. Guy went like this. Okay. What's in here? No. All right. There it is. New session.

1219
03:53:34,780 --> 03:53:41,479
New little mini game here. All course marathon. No. I know what this is and I don't want to do it.

1220
03:53:42,420 --> 03:54:45,930
Difficulty impossible. This is impossible. How is this impossible? That's why I'm not doing it.

1221
03:54:45,930 --> 03:54:53,110
All right. What's up Adidas? What's over here? I see a door hit this way. What's in the what's

1222
03:54:53,110 --> 03:55:09,209
in the computer lab? I don't know. I've been down here, right? What's left in here? I think I've

1223
03:55:09,209 --> 03:55:15,639
seen everything. Play the numbers. No, no, no. We're just going to keep that one counting.

1224
03:55:18,340 --> 03:55:39,420
Maybe one, maybe one little peek. Maybe just a little peek, you know? How are we doing? All

1225
03:55:39,420 --> 03:55:49,590
right. I got two quadrillion. Ooh, hold on. Rebirth. 145 fucking million for rebirth. Okay.

1226
03:55:50,700 --> 03:55:57,159
Experience. 10 exp. We're going to do energy speed and we're going to do it again. We're going to do

1227
03:55:57,159 --> 03:56:06,540
a few times. I'm going to go back over here to fight boss. What do we need? 317 versus 148.

1228
03:56:07,100 --> 03:56:13,450
273. I need a little, I mean, I need more defense. This is going to be close, but I need defense.

1229
03:56:13,450 --> 03:56:20,010
So I'm going to go into here. Basic training. Pull this out. Put it in here. Just we got to

1230
03:56:20,010 --> 03:56:25,719
get a little bit more defense. Money pit. A million bucks is going in the money pit. Dump.

1231
03:56:26,360 --> 03:56:32,200
You gain plus a zero one health regen. Okay. I can have two hours from now. I have to come back

1232
03:56:32,200 --> 03:56:43,350
and do this again. That looks all right. Fight boss. 15. Let's see what happens.

1233
03:56:46,170 --> 03:56:56,389
No, stop, stop, stop. That's not worth it. I have a hundred more than he does. And then my defense

1234
03:56:56,389 --> 03:57:07,500
is 160 less. So we need to wait till I get this a little higher, but I got a strong attack now.

1235
03:57:08,540 --> 03:57:13,459
What does this one do? Base attack received is 2000 instead of a thousand.

1236
03:57:15,430 --> 03:57:32,979
Holy shit. Yeah. Yeah. Let's dump it into that. We can't see. Re. Yes, you can. Look. All right.

1237
03:57:33,700 --> 03:57:44,649
Uh, that's all right. I think that's fine. Fight boss. I'll have enough here. 300. I'll have enough.

1238
03:57:46,040 --> 03:57:51,559
I might have enough now. No, I'm going down faster. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. We'll,

1239
03:57:51,559 --> 03:57:55,659
we'll come back to it. Oh, you better believe we're going to be doing it again,

1240
03:57:57,260 --> 03:58:06,870
but never again after today. I mean, like actually never again after today. All right.

1241
03:58:08,520 --> 03:58:26,969
Oh, to the next world, wherever that is. Can I just put the menu? Okay.

1242
03:58:28,790 --> 03:58:39,700
Play the playground. Ooh, this one looks cool. Really? I get to slide on the slide.

1243
03:58:40,579 --> 03:58:52,040
You ready to play with the big kids? Don't embarrass me. Okay. Let's go. Ooh, chess.

1244
03:58:52,760 --> 03:59:18,149
That one. This one's called recess. It does take like a backpack. Fuck. Okay. You got to

1245
03:59:18,149 --> 03:59:28,569
jump around across the person. Got my way. I'm going to wait because me and this guy are on the

1246
03:59:28,569 --> 03:59:51,690
exact same. We're doing it at the same time. I'm going to go around the card. Did I not get it?

1247
03:59:51,690 --> 04:00:14,010
What the fuck did I not get that? I don't, where was, where was the thing to grab? Oh, I missed it.

1248
04:00:14,010 --> 04:00:32,620
It was right here. Whoa. I used to get the cards. How the fuck does this work? Climb it. Climb it.

1249
04:00:33,260 --> 04:00:52,020
Down the slide or riot. Down the slide or riot. I can hear you. Holy shit actually is down the slide.

1250
04:00:52,739 --> 04:01:09,559
Where's the, over there. I don't even have to go this way. I have to go to the tires. I'm dead.

1251
04:01:09,559 --> 04:01:58,010
Fall damage. I died. There we go. I just broke. My neck just like broke. Ah, it's so painful.

1252
04:02:02,579 --> 04:02:20,579
Learn to bunny hop or get the fuck out. Right? Card. Learn to scrape or get the fuck out.

1253
04:02:26,389 --> 04:02:29,590
What's the purpose of bunny hopping? I think it just keeps your momentum and you just keep

1254
04:02:29,590 --> 04:02:41,799
going faster and faster and faster and faster and faster. I think you unlock the big kids slide.

1255
04:02:41,799 --> 04:03:04,780
That sounds like fun one. Wait, let me do this. I can get at least one cool thing.

1256
04:03:07,319 --> 04:03:14,360
Oh, which one did I unlock? Where'd it go? Big kids slide. I think it's the big kids slide.

1257
04:03:20,819 --> 04:03:30,940
Apple. Forget about books. Give me the apple. What the hell is this place over here?

1258
04:03:31,899 --> 04:03:44,520
Always pick up an apple. Always. So if I just run on the ground. I'm getting momentum just

1259
04:03:44,520 --> 04:04:16,139
by running. Wait a second. Okay. So you have to be running a certain amount of speed first.

1260
04:04:22,139 --> 04:04:28,950
Admin, he's doing it sideways. Am I not supposed to be doing that? I always thought bunny hopping

1261
04:04:28,950 --> 04:04:33,670
was you have to like move your camera around. Like you have to flick your face around to like

1262
04:04:33,750 --> 04:04:42,120
get momentum to like throw yourself. Is that correct? You do. You do. You do. Okay.

1263
04:04:59,979 --> 04:05:02,700
I could see how people would get obsessed with this game.

1264
04:05:03,899 --> 04:05:18,120
Just trying to get every single damn thing. Where are we even going?

1265
04:05:18,120 --> 04:05:27,829
It's like you've become so obsessed with trying to. Oh man. There are probably people that are

1266
04:05:27,829 --> 04:05:33,829
going to be just bunny hopping with like times 10 speed and just drape up this thing. It ain't

1267
04:05:33,829 --> 04:06:00,340
going to be me. I will never do that. Not down. Slide down slide. Slide down. This really is

1268
04:06:00,340 --> 04:06:25,979
just kind of an open playing field. All right. Did you hear that? Somebody had to have heard

1269
04:06:25,979 --> 04:07:00,620
that. That was like a snapped neck. Back this way. Sorry. I did the same thing. These levels,

1270
04:07:00,620 --> 04:07:04,940
this one was weird. It's like Tony Hawk level. You kind of can just go anywhere you want.

1271
04:07:06,120 --> 04:07:22,059
But there's one goal. Checkpoint 15 of 19. Enough momentum. That's fucking hard to do.

1272
04:07:35,530 --> 04:08:03,139
Get on the trash can. I can't grab that pole. What? I thought it was a grabble pole. Just play

1273
04:08:03,139 --> 04:08:13,159
Tony Hawk instead. I could play Tony Hawk, but I don't think I can right now. I'm currently

1274
04:08:13,159 --> 04:08:27,780
playing hot lava. How the fuck do you get up there? Wait a minute. Just start from there.

1275
04:08:27,780 --> 04:08:49,399
Bounce bounce bounce. I guess this way. No. What? I gotta see that. I'm getting the Mario music.

1276
04:08:49,399 --> 04:09:11,100
The Mario like hurry up music. That's what I just landed on. Numbers go up waiting room. Yeah. Cool

1277
04:09:11,100 --> 04:09:17,860
stream. Can I have your Xbox? Like you mean you actually physically want my Xbox? Why would I

1278
04:09:17,860 --> 04:09:31,079
give you my Xbox? He's another pogo level. You don't want this thing. All right. This is a

1279
04:09:31,079 --> 04:10:06,250
checkpoint with pogo stick. Let's do it. Just trying to keep up speed. This is like an exact

1280
04:10:06,250 --> 04:10:51,540
route you take too with this shit. I gotta go. We're all nauseating. My head. What's going on?

1281
04:10:52,260 --> 04:11:18,329
Why is this doing this? He's like a dog's asshole. Where did it open?

1282
04:11:18,969 --> 04:11:32,620
Anybody see it? Can you guys, can you tell me what the next step thing is?

1283
04:11:32,620 --> 04:11:53,059
They can't hear me right? Is it over here? Chase the big kid. All right. This is freaking me out.

1284
04:11:53,059 --> 04:12:08,360
Quit the menu. Toy shop. Let's put on some new stuff. I'll stick with the bandana guy. Horns.

1285
04:12:08,360 --> 04:12:21,770
Hat. I like the hat. Staff. Backpack. Keyboard. This is rare. Keyboard. What's this? Sneakers.

1286
04:12:22,489 --> 04:12:30,020
Yeah. Cool. Sneakers. Fist pump. And I want the easy button behind me. Nice.

1287
04:12:33,930 --> 04:12:44,280
Let's go to school. Sounds like a fun time to me. I also have to piss again.

1288
04:12:50,120 --> 04:13:08,889
You look like Woody from Toy Story. ABC's one two threes. All right. Let's do it. I'm

1289
04:13:08,889 --> 04:13:26,549
starting to get like a dungeon. By the way, this is the first song you learn on any guitar.

1290
04:13:26,549 --> 04:13:32,389
It's the first like four chords. Chords. Chords. Chords. It's the first four chords you learn.

1291
04:13:33,350 --> 04:14:16,260
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Oh, come on. Thank God. It just helps you.

1292
04:14:16,979 --> 04:14:37,510
You gotta get up top. Oh, I'm getting, I'm getting actually upset right now.

1293
04:14:37,510 --> 04:15:06,149
This used to be a fucking counting screen. Bounce from where do you want to bounce to?

1294
04:15:07,110 --> 04:15:55,739
No, we bolted the same exact thing at the same exact fucking time. Okay. He's waiting for me.

1295
04:15:56,299 --> 04:16:40,950
I went the wrong way. Fuck you. Chair. Is that lava there? I'm so confused. So I understand the

1296
04:16:40,950 --> 04:16:46,329
whole like the floor is lava gimmick. Does the floor actually have to be lava in this game?

1297
04:16:46,969 --> 04:17:05,239
Why can't it just be don't touch the floor? Hey. Throw shit. Why can't it just be don't touch the

1298
04:17:05,319 --> 04:17:17,270
red floor? I know it fucks up the whole thing. Otherwise, it would just be a Counter-Strike map.

1299
04:17:17,909 --> 04:17:35,139
It would just be a Garry's Mod custom game. I need momentum to get up there. Wait, guys. Wait for

1300
04:17:35,139 --> 04:18:05,639
me. Don't leave without me. Wait for me. Wait. Don't leave. Wait for me. I got it. I didn't

1301
04:18:05,639 --> 04:18:27,370
touch it. What? How did I not touch this? I need to put on my own music. This music is just like,

1302
04:18:28,229 --> 04:18:33,750
I feel like this is like a car commercial on the radio. Hold on. I got to get my own

1303
04:18:33,750 --> 04:18:46,569
fucking music in here. What do I want? What do I want from music? The piano. The piano is better

1304
04:18:46,569 --> 04:18:58,309
than music. No, not Minecraft. It's something that's going to pump me up. How about, no,

1305
04:18:58,309 --> 04:19:12,620
not Tony Hawk. That's how you get the whole stream turned off. Sonic? What's that song? Who's the

1306
04:19:12,620 --> 04:19:17,020
band that does all the Sonic songs? There's one band that's been doing every single theme song

1307
04:19:17,020 --> 04:19:20,860
for like 10 years. What's that band called? Anybody know the name of that band? What's that

1308
04:19:20,860 --> 04:19:37,290
band's name? By Crush 40. All right. Is this going to make the whole stream going to turn off?

1309
04:19:47,780 --> 04:19:56,120
Will it? Whatever. It's hot lava. I'm not like composing Mozart on this stream today.

1310
04:20:14,120 --> 04:20:19,020
Why does it feel like it's playing twice? I think I'm losing my mind.

1311
04:20:19,979 --> 04:20:41,219
Why will you truly follow your peace and pain

1312
04:20:43,459 --> 04:20:47,700
when you can't help but swallow?

1313
04:20:49,219 --> 04:20:51,540
If it's right that way, you can.

1314
04:20:51,700 --> 04:21:21,850
It's. Sing it. I need to go up that way. Something, something, whatever it is.

1315
04:21:23,139 --> 04:21:26,579
Do Twitch sings. I don't, I don't, I don't, I have no idea how to do that.

1316
04:21:27,620 --> 04:22:11,159
Plus that's an embarrassment strings. And this is not. Has it done how to bunny hop? Is that,

1317
04:22:11,159 --> 04:22:31,430
is that the jab there? And you see how many millions I have here? Hey, is this embarrassing?

1318
04:22:31,430 --> 04:22:39,319
378 trillion attack power. Is that an embarrassment? Speaking of.

1319
04:22:53,620 --> 04:23:11,579
Done. 443 million. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's coming up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1320
04:23:14,219 --> 04:23:24,790
Oh no, it's a long. Yeah. All right. Let's keep going. Money pit. I got an hour and 30

1321
04:23:24,790 --> 04:23:28,469
before I can do the money put again. What about this? No, I can't even attempt

1322
04:23:29,190 --> 04:23:32,549
10 experience. Let's go with I'm going to wait for 15.

1323
04:23:37,719 --> 04:23:45,829
I should rebirth now. Look at that. So fucking huge. That's it. Exponentially increased. My

1324
04:23:45,829 --> 04:23:56,250
inventory is fucking messed up. And what about special? I can do one more of these.

1325
04:23:58,040 --> 04:24:01,479
No special in any of the other ones. Any power in the sword,

1326
04:24:02,040 --> 04:24:09,299
toughness in the pants, combined boots, combined chest, pants, pants, pants, put it on

1327
04:24:10,620 --> 04:24:19,739
toughness, three out of seven, combine the cube, special, get in there, boots, helmet, sword.

1328
04:24:20,700 --> 04:24:28,260
Now let's take a little bit of an inventory here. We need toughness, toughness, special,

1329
04:24:30,979 --> 04:24:36,700
sword, special. We're going to put this. I don't think I can put this anywhere.

1330
04:24:37,500 --> 04:24:47,379
No, I can. We're good. This is now impossible. I've done my points. I wait. Not yet.

1331
04:24:48,180 --> 04:24:56,389
That was it. Somebody tell me. I thought I was wrong.

1332
04:24:58,459 --> 04:25:11,500
Yeah, there it is right there. All right. Let's get going. I'll come back in another 20 minutes.

1333
04:25:14,250 --> 04:25:21,700
And then I want to play this. I want to play. I want to play this game.

1334
04:25:42,729 --> 04:25:50,860
Wasn't it? Oh yeah. Escape from the city. That's the one, right? What's it called?

1335
04:25:55,459 --> 04:26:07,450
Escape the city. And this is the one that goes rolling around at the speed of sound, right?

1336
04:26:07,450 --> 04:26:42,229
Something like that. Let's go.

1337
04:27:13,299 --> 04:27:26,940
Do I do there?

1338
04:27:47,500 --> 04:28:06,010
Mobile viewers posting lyrics too late. I'm going to watch you. How are you doing this?

1339
04:28:06,010 --> 04:28:47,979
I see. I'm trying to follow them. Something going to autoplay.

1340
04:29:01,959 --> 04:29:05,479
Stop throwing shit at me. I've got it. It's tough enough as it is for me.

1341
04:29:14,809 --> 04:29:18,729
I bounced backwards. I need more Sonic the Hedgehog theme music for me to be able to do this.

1342
04:29:19,370 --> 04:29:59,350
This one has seven million views. What is this one? Seven fucking million. Oh, I know.

1343
04:30:33,399 --> 04:30:46,600
Louder vessel. It's not helping. The beat's wrong on this one for me.

1344
04:30:47,420 --> 04:31:04,059
It's not helping. The other one was. My turn. Get off of that. How do I do that? All right. Up on top.

1345
04:31:04,940 --> 04:31:12,200
I fell off. I'm just like slippery shit. It's a slippery fucking thing.

1346
04:31:19,340 --> 04:31:35,670
What the fuck are you in the way for? Worst Sonic song by far. Like if there's a top five,

1347
04:31:35,670 --> 04:32:00,100
this is five. What's this? What's this? Fist bump. Fist bump. Sonic Forces. There was a Sonic Forces

1348
04:32:00,819 --> 04:33:17,880
fist bump. One second. Sorry. I have a VPN. It takes me 10 seconds to load anything. Same song.

1349
04:33:18,900 --> 04:33:33,939
We'll listen to the real one. I listen to this way too much. I'm not even like that. I'm not

1350
04:33:33,939 --> 04:33:48,919
even that big of an Undertale fan, but I listened to... Didn't help. I don't even know where the

1351
04:33:48,919 --> 04:34:39,189
fuck I'm supposed to go. I have to go down? I have to go over there. From here. God. What the hell?

1352
04:34:40,069 --> 04:34:46,360
Here this way. Let's go. So let's jump this way. Down here. Across over there. Onto the loo.

1353
04:34:47,319 --> 04:34:55,659
Nice. Got it. Onto the wood. Oh, I fell down. Oh, that's unfortunate. Oh well. Try it again.

1354
04:34:56,619 --> 04:35:05,060
Oh, so wing it. Oh, nice try. Nice try. Excellent work. Oh, almost made three points.

1355
04:35:05,939 --> 04:35:37,770
I just have to go over there. Bounce. I jumped over the fucking thing. How many of these did I

1356
04:35:37,849 --> 04:36:55,240
jump over? Why is this playing again? Why is this playing again? Boom. Look at that pace.

1357
04:36:56,709 --> 04:37:08,409
Don't look at that pace. Oh, it's megalovania for one hour. Now I know why. Oops. Oh, got a new

1358
04:37:08,409 --> 04:37:21,400
session. Middle school. Was that middle school mischief? That one was difficult. Do it, coward.

1359
04:37:23,099 --> 04:37:33,779
Coward. What do you mean coward? Tape your face into a neutral position. Tape your face

1360
04:37:34,099 --> 04:38:03,500
into a neutral position. I get what? And my eyes? Do it and I'll sub. Really? Really? You'll sub

1361
04:38:03,500 --> 04:38:12,889
if I do the tape on the face thing. Or I'm gonna get acne. No. What if I just stay neutral? Like

1362
04:38:12,889 --> 04:38:22,900
the tape residue is gonna get in my pores and I'm gonna get zits. Go get it. Get tape or no sub.

1363
04:38:23,540 --> 04:38:33,060
Tape. What do you mean? Why? Why do I need to tape my face into it? It clears your pores. Tape

1364
04:38:33,779 --> 04:38:41,270
blocks your pores because it's tape. Do it. Don't sell out. All right. So one guy just said don't

1365
04:38:41,270 --> 04:38:52,779
sell out. Okay. Yeah. I will not make a reaction. I will put, I put artificial tape here. No reaction.

1366
04:38:52,779 --> 04:39:00,520
If I do any reaction. No, I tried this before and it was fucking bad. Do you guys remember

1367
04:39:00,520 --> 04:39:09,159
the don't make and don't laugh at all for like 10 straight minutes? That was horrible.

1368
04:39:10,810 --> 04:39:19,340
All right. No. All right. I'll try it. No emotions for 10 straight minutes or I do a hundred gifted

1369
04:39:19,340 --> 04:39:39,930
subs. When does it start? I already fucking can't do it. Every funny thing I've ever heard in my

1370
04:39:39,930 --> 04:39:44,810
whole life. Every fucking awful thing that's ever happened to me. They're all flowing to the front

1371
04:39:44,810 --> 04:39:50,090
of my cerebral cortex right now. And they're just like, I'm ready. I'm ready. Remember the time when

1372
04:39:50,090 --> 04:39:53,849
you did this? Remember that funny thing? Remember the movie you watched when you really laughed?

1373
04:39:53,849 --> 04:40:00,619
They're all getting in here. They're all getting to the front row. That was funny, but it's not.

1374
04:40:00,619 --> 04:40:09,189
Okay. No music's going to make me fucking laugh too. 10 minutes straight. I need, I need to look

1375
04:40:09,189 --> 04:40:14,790
over. Where's my timer? Four hours and 41 minutes in the stream. I got to pee first too. This is,

1376
04:40:14,790 --> 04:40:37,189
I'm going all in. I'll be right back. Hey, it's Jeremy again. I'm back. I have an idea for the

1377
04:40:37,189 --> 04:40:45,099
only reason why I would ever do media share. A stream where I have to stay completely,

1378
04:40:45,099 --> 04:40:59,130
completely emotionless while you guys do media share. And you have to try to break me. Interesting

1379
04:40:59,130 --> 04:42:58,229
scenario. Think about that. I'll sleep on that one. I'll be right back. Okay. I'm back. Let's

1380
04:42:58,229 --> 04:43:09,720
give this a try. Uh, I get three strikes by the way. 10 minutes, three strikes. Yes, I do. Yes,

1381
04:43:09,720 --> 04:43:17,299
I do. I make the rules. Okay. I make the rules. Three strikes, 10 minutes. Cause I know it's

1382
04:43:17,299 --> 04:43:25,909
going to happen. Three strikes. Uh, I make the rules. You guys get to pick the music,

1383
04:43:28,580 --> 04:43:42,229
come to a consensus on something. How the fuck are you going to do that in five seconds? Uh,

1384
04:43:43,639 --> 04:43:52,790
no, not okay. What, what, what is, people keep writing this shit. What is this? Pumpkin Hill?

1385
04:43:52,790 --> 04:44:05,770
Pumpkin Hill, Sonic Adventure 2 music.

1386
04:44:12,090 --> 04:44:19,770
Okay. Pumpkin Hill. Why do I remember this song?

1387
04:44:20,490 --> 04:44:24,569
Cause I have no fear. This probably seems crazy, crazy. Graveyard theory.

1388
04:44:28,569 --> 04:44:32,090
Why is Chad's thinking the worst song? It's not me picking it.

1389
04:44:36,090 --> 04:44:49,029
Let's go. We're not starting yet. I'll give you a big face cam just so you guys can really,

1390
04:44:49,029 --> 04:44:49,509
really take a look.

1391
04:45:02,040 --> 04:45:09,369
I'm not allowed to. Okay. Okay. Emotionless doesn't mean I can't move my entire facial muscles.

1392
04:45:10,970 --> 04:45:21,459
This is going to be hard. No, emotionless means like no laughing, no getting angry, no what the

1393
04:45:21,459 --> 04:45:33,020
fuck? No. Oh, that was funny. Nothing. Just blank. But I can like go like this. Like I can like touch

1394
04:45:33,020 --> 04:45:46,540
my face and stuff. You can't smile. I won't smile. I'm a fucking four year old. You can't do that.

1395
04:45:46,540 --> 04:46:06,229
Now I want to do that. This thing is this, this guy sucks. This guy sucks. That's an emotion,

1396
04:46:06,229 --> 04:46:16,630
but it's not time. I'm waiting till the end of the song because this is cheating for you guys.

1397
04:46:19,750 --> 04:46:23,909
Cause it needs to be at the beginning of a new song.

1398
04:46:38,540 --> 04:46:48,779
It hasn't started yet. It hasn't started yet.

1399
04:46:51,099 --> 04:47:08,470
Fuck. No, that's not one. Let me beat this level first. Oh, I need momentum. I have to stay

1400
04:47:08,470 --> 04:47:13,750
completely. I gotta stay completely fucking still too. Well, that's not going to happen

1401
04:47:13,750 --> 04:47:15,189
because I'm a fidgeter.

1402
04:47:15,669 --> 04:47:21,380
I ain't going to let it get to me. I'm just going to creep down the park.

1403
04:47:21,380 --> 04:47:23,380
I got it. Holy shit, there's more.

1404
04:47:23,380 --> 04:47:25,860
I know that it's here. Rocking, sensing it in my feet.

1405
04:47:25,860 --> 04:47:31,270
The gray emeralds be the fear. See a thing, but it's around somewhere.

1406
04:47:31,270 --> 04:47:36,630
I'm gonna hold my head and fear. This prophecy turns gray. A gray dark theory.

1407
04:47:36,630 --> 04:47:44,439
I coast trying, but he ain't got a theory. Now that it's still a second, I'm walking to the

1408
04:47:44,520 --> 04:47:58,330
fuck. They look like emerald shards. Oh, I'm going to hang on to that one now.

1409
04:47:58,330 --> 04:48:03,450
Fuck. I need you to start it because you guys have thrown shit out there that is

1410
04:48:03,450 --> 04:48:04,970
it's going to, it's going to fuck with me.

1411
04:48:19,880 --> 04:48:25,319
Okay. I get three strikes starting. Okay. No emotion, no anger,

1412
04:48:25,319 --> 04:48:38,900
no frustration, no laughing like this. This, I can't fucking do this.

1413
04:48:38,900 --> 04:48:41,299
I can't do it. I might as well just give everybody a hundred subs right now.

1414
04:48:42,259 --> 04:48:51,049
It's impossible for me. There's no way I, there is confetti that's getting stuffed down here

1415
04:48:52,169 --> 04:48:55,209
and somebody is just going to pull the string down here and just boom.

1416
04:48:55,849 --> 04:48:58,650
It just builds and builds and builds and builds until like it has to come out.

1417
04:49:00,700 --> 04:49:16,700
Brick by brick Lego Island. OST. Is this a funny song? Okay. Starting off three strikes.

1418
04:49:17,580 --> 04:49:27,700
Here we go. I'm going to watch the timer here. We're 450.

1419
04:49:28,500 --> 04:49:38,520
I almost laughed because I had this on the screen. Just sitting here huge in front of me right now.

1420
04:49:39,400 --> 04:49:50,060
Here we go. In 10 seconds at 451 and then at four at 501 stream time.

1421
04:49:51,159 --> 04:49:53,639
I got it right here. Here we go. Starting now.

1422
04:50:17,459 --> 04:50:20,500
You can paint a jet ski yellow like that.

1423
04:50:37,270 --> 04:50:45,380
That's still part of one. That's still part of one. That's still part of one.

1424
04:50:48,360 --> 04:50:52,779
Alright. Why did I do this to myself?

1425
04:50:53,340 --> 04:51:11,669
Lego seed. When you're behind the tent. If you do it brick by brick.

1426
04:51:18,709 --> 04:51:25,159
Fuck. I just picture like a big fucking southern family on stage. They're like a

1427
04:51:25,159 --> 04:51:53,130
bang. They're like a huge cello. It's like a hunt. There's like 12 of them. They're all in the same family.

1428
04:51:53,130 --> 04:51:58,330
There's something you should know. When you block the road. You're going to get towed.

1429
04:51:58,330 --> 04:52:12,459
Brick by brick. I told Nick. You can build a brick by brick.

1430
04:52:12,459 --> 04:52:46,169
Machine ready yellow SD by slacks. All around the island right here. No matter. You can move a man. You can move a mountain. If you do it brick by brick.

1431
04:55:43,139 --> 04:56:09,299
There's somebody in fucking chat. Somebody in chat said this streamer doesn't talk. Why? Like what the fuck?

1432
04:56:10,099 --> 04:56:17,110
The music and just the part that I like. He's just sitting there playing like fucking shit.

1433
04:56:17,909 --> 04:56:24,650
I don't know why the fuck I looked at chat. I needed two and two and a half more minutes.

1434
04:56:30,470 --> 04:56:43,419
Hold on a second. Just keep the music playing. Double or nothing? No. I ain't playing that game anymore.

1435
04:56:48,819 --> 04:57:03,459
It's this music too. Like what the fuck even is this music? I'll have to do it from here. How the

1436
04:57:03,459 --> 04:57:14,069
fuck do I? I don't know how to do this every time. How do I even give community subs? Here we go.

1437
04:57:14,069 --> 04:57:31,959
I don't know why I play these fucking dangerous games with myself. I continue to play play dumb

1438
04:57:31,959 --> 04:58:18,409
games. You play stupid games. Gift us. Here it is. Okay. Here we go. Congratulations.

1439
04:58:31,020 --> 04:58:38,869
Dodged it. You dodged it. That's a free shit. I didn't get one. Do it again.

1440
04:58:46,659 --> 04:59:00,979
That was not a lie. No. All right. Let's keep going. I'm already subscribed. What happened to

1441
04:59:00,979 --> 04:59:14,490
the Lego Island music? That's a vacuum cleaner. What time is it? Five hours? How many? We got two

1442
04:59:14,490 --> 04:59:34,009
hours in. I gotta rebirth this. Who even gives a shit about hot lava anymore? It's good. It's a

1443
04:59:34,009 --> 04:59:48,409
good game. It's good. But my mind is only on numbers going up in a sequence at the moment.

1444
04:59:48,409 --> 05:00:03,209
Let me get to the end of this. Thanks. You got one? Thanks for the sub. Yeah. There it is.

1445
05:00:03,209 --> 05:00:13,669
Listen to one. Listen to one hour of vacuum without laughing. I'll do. Okay. Why is that on

1446
05:00:13,669 --> 05:00:19,849
screen? All right. No, not double enough. And I just did it. I'll do, I'll do two straight minutes

1447
05:00:20,650 --> 05:00:27,159
of vacuum cleaner sound without flinching. And if I don't do it, I'll dab on stream.

1448
05:00:28,279 --> 05:00:35,400
That's much better than a hundred community subs. Oh, who even gives a shit about hot? All right.

1449
05:00:35,400 --> 05:00:40,360
It's a great game. It's fun. It was fun for a while. It was cool. I don't care anymore. Oh,

1450
05:00:40,360 --> 05:01:05,450
I care about listening to vacuum cleaners. Ready? Two minutes. I need to change this to something

1451
05:01:05,450 --> 05:01:09,209
else. Because if you're looking for hot lava gameplay and you come in here and it's a guy

1452
05:01:09,209 --> 05:01:14,779
listening to a vacuum cleaner, you're going to probably sort of annoyed by that. And I don't

1453
05:01:14,779 --> 05:01:37,849
blame you. I don't. Let's change the title. Where's my shit? There it is. All right. I can keep the

1454
05:01:37,849 --> 05:01:51,020
title at numbers go up. It's been like that the whole time, even with the lava one. Okay. All right.

1455
05:01:51,180 --> 05:02:01,619
Let's do it. Are you ready? So people, just so people can know, I need to put a text on the

1456
05:02:01,619 --> 05:02:29,750
screen just so people know. Cause if you come in here, you need to be curious, right? All right.

1457
05:02:29,750 --> 05:02:39,959
No, what the fuck is, get back here. Okay. I'm ready. I'm going to try. It's going to be loud.

1458
05:02:39,959 --> 05:02:59,299
Just to make sure everyone's aware of that. Both earphones. I'm not going to cheat. Two minutes.

1459
05:02:59,380 --> 05:03:03,459
I see it on the clock. I'm ready. Three, two, one.

1460
05:03:51,990 --> 05:04:01,419
There's two things going on here. Somebody said, dude, use push to talk. You fucking asshole.

1461
05:04:01,419 --> 05:04:06,380
And the second thing is you can, you're going to hear the vacuum cleaner going over a rug.

1462
05:04:06,380 --> 05:04:18,630
It goes like, going back and forth. There you go. I can do it. I've done that so many times now.

1463
05:04:19,430 --> 05:05:11,979
Three, two, one. God damn it. One, two, three, go.

1464
05:06:34,090 --> 05:06:41,240
Fix your mic. I have the gain turned up all the fucking way.

1465
05:06:46,409 --> 05:06:52,659
Hey guys, what's going on? Yeah. Hi guys. Just my microphone can't pick me up. So I

1466
05:06:52,659 --> 05:07:07,580
got to turn the gain all the way up. He's weak to mic. No, it's just like,

1467
05:07:08,540 --> 05:07:11,580
I just imagine somebody fucking needing to turn their mic all the way to,

1468
05:07:12,779 --> 05:07:37,180
how many minutes was that? It was less than two. I don't want to. I never told you they were going

1469
05:07:37,180 --> 05:07:40,950
to be any good. How the hell am I going to do this? Okay. I need something that's,

1470
05:07:43,590 --> 05:07:46,970
I need something else that's on a vacuum cleaner. Cause you guys,

1471
05:07:46,970 --> 05:07:54,740
I need something that you guys can't make jokes about. You know what I mean?

1472
05:07:54,740 --> 05:08:08,810
You guys, you guys are too quick. Microwave sound. I'll try it.

1473
05:08:08,810 --> 05:08:33,700
This just sounds like an airplane. It's, that's the same sound. Fix your fucking mic.

1474
05:08:34,580 --> 05:08:56,060
Ah, that's the best one so far. All right. How about, um, saxophone? Let's see. Okay. Three,

1475
05:08:56,139 --> 05:09:49,939
two, one.

1476
05:10:05,430 --> 05:10:12,970
It's the fucking people in the background. Oh, it's the people that were talking. There was a

1477
05:10:12,970 --> 05:10:23,080
crowd. It was just like street noise. A minute. I don't care if this takes me all night. I'll do

1478
05:10:23,080 --> 05:10:32,840
it. I don't care if it takes me all five. You know what? Fuck it. Three minutes. One, two, three,

1479
05:10:32,840 --> 05:10:50,119
go. That's different. What? Right. Hold on. Three, two, one, go. Three, two, three, two, one,

1480
05:10:50,119 --> 05:10:54,709
three. Three, two, one, go.

1481
05:12:51,180 --> 05:12:57,669
Nothing was funny. It just, this one went on for a long time. This one went on for like a full,

1482
05:12:57,669 --> 05:13:03,189
like 45 seconds. Usually the first three minutes of this video was one, two, here's another saxophone.

1483
05:13:03,189 --> 05:13:14,790
Here's another saxophone. And this guy just keep playing. This guy's just going. I think my brain

1484
05:13:15,750 --> 05:13:22,790
is, there you go. Hey, there you are. I think my brain is too fucked up to do this.

1485
05:13:27,020 --> 05:13:37,740
Every second, there's like something else in here. Give me something else. Something easy. You gotta,

1486
05:13:37,740 --> 05:13:49,180
something easy. The beach. That's actually would work pretty well, I think. I can't see myself

1487
05:13:49,180 --> 05:13:56,490
laughing at the beach. It's the beach. It's just a beach. What's the fun? There's nothing there.

1488
05:13:56,490 --> 05:14:01,930
Just imagine. Can I close my eyes? Is that, can I close my eyes? I can't, right? Like you're not

1489
05:14:01,930 --> 05:14:07,240
going to take that from me. Actually that'll make it worse because then I'll just see images.

1490
05:14:08,459 --> 05:14:13,740
Okay. We're going to go with, you just laughed at a vacuum. I know, but it was a lot more going on.

1491
05:14:14,459 --> 05:14:18,380
There were like four or 500 different onion layers as to why the vacuum was funny.

1492
05:14:19,979 --> 05:14:28,700
Okay. Let's do the beach ambience. Blinking is also emotion. No, it's a necessary

1493
05:14:28,700 --> 05:14:40,500
mechanism to survive. Ocean sounds for sleep. How would you think this was funny? This is not

1494
05:14:40,500 --> 05:14:54,779
at all. Here we go. Beach ambience on tropical paradise. Impossible to think this is funny.

1495
05:14:59,540 --> 05:15:07,639
Three minutes. I'm prepared. It's all out of my system at this point. Three minutes. That's not,

1496
05:15:07,639 --> 05:15:12,040
I've been streaming for fucking five, almost five and a half hours. Three minutes is not a big deal.

1497
05:15:12,119 --> 05:15:37,669
I can do three goddamn minutes, but hold on a second. Okay. I, how are we doing? Fight the boss.

1498
05:15:37,669 --> 05:15:44,150
No, rebirth. Almost there. And in four minutes I get rewarded with, with a hundred million,

1499
05:15:45,669 --> 05:15:53,340
a billion. I'll figure this out later. Okay. That sounds good. Four more minutes and I can

1500
05:15:53,340 --> 05:16:06,259
rebirth again. Just focus on the rebirth and that's it. Okay. This isn't funny. So don't laugh. I know.

1501
05:16:06,259 --> 05:16:13,459
That's what I'm saying. It's, this is just water sounds. Three, two, one, action.

1502
05:16:48,200 --> 05:17:39,930
Started over, started over. So is it bath time? Started over three minutes. Starting now. Go. Now.

1503
05:18:04,279 --> 05:18:10,200
Wait, my mind's allowed to wander. I need like some, I need sound. I need noise. I need something

1504
05:18:10,200 --> 05:18:15,639
talking. I can't fucking do it. I can't do it. I don't think I can. There's your one, your two,

1505
05:18:15,639 --> 05:18:23,060
your three, whatever it is. I don't think I can do it. Do math. I keep thinking of fucking bath now.

1506
05:18:23,060 --> 05:18:31,369
Somebody said bath time with Jeremy. Fuck. Just listen to a Ted talk. Is that like a loud, is that

1507
05:18:31,369 --> 05:18:40,790
loud? Can I listen to a Ted talk? Ted talk like science. I don't know. This is quantum physics,

1508
05:18:42,099 --> 05:19:21,990
quantum physics. When it starts in three, two, a lot about. Have you ever had, so have you ever

1509
05:19:21,990 --> 05:19:27,509
had this experience? Starting now. Having a chat with someone and they're telling you something

1510
05:19:27,509 --> 05:19:33,819
about a subject they're very interested in or they know a lot about and you're following along

1511
05:19:34,540 --> 05:19:37,819
and then at some stage you realize you kind of lost the thread of what they're saying

1512
05:19:38,779 --> 05:19:42,619
and then you're standing there and you realize you've got absolutely no idea what they're talking

1513
05:19:42,619 --> 05:19:50,310
about. I had this recently with a friend who knows a lot about investing. No. And something.

1514
05:19:50,310 --> 05:19:57,610
Because I just saw me in the fucking reflector watching TV this way. Like I'm watching TV on

1515
05:19:57,610 --> 05:20:07,639
stream and the TV's off camera over here. No, it can't be somebody talking. I got it. I know

1516
05:20:07,639 --> 05:20:30,090
it'll, I know what to do. Um, how long is it? Okay. The national anthem is five minutes long.

1517
05:20:30,090 --> 05:20:47,049
Here we go. United States of America national anthem. Um, no, uh, how about, um,

1518
05:20:47,930 --> 05:21:03,209
zoo, uh, I don't know what TV static. No, why would beach? Why would I not be able to do

1519
05:21:03,209 --> 05:21:13,020
beach for fuck's sake? Seagull sounds that actually would be okay. This, this has to be the one.

1520
05:21:13,020 --> 05:21:17,270
If I don't do it here, then I'm turning the stream off. I'm out of here. This is like,

1521
05:21:17,270 --> 05:21:41,450
I've got to go like dunk my head in water. It's plugged in just to make sure everyone sees it.

1522
05:21:41,450 --> 05:29:06,700
It's plugged in. Okay. Starting now. This is the last time I'm ever going to play this game.

1523
05:29:08,869 --> 05:29:12,549
No, I am so Zen. I'm completely Zen. So we need to have a Zen background.

1524
05:29:13,590 --> 05:29:38,680
This is six hours of Zen. No, no, no. Katamari. There we go. It feels pretty good. All right. So

1525
05:29:38,680 --> 05:29:44,759
I need now I have 25 experience points. We're going to do plus one energy speed. There we go.

1526
05:29:45,479 --> 05:29:55,130
Get a couple more of these too. Why not? That's for going very fast. I don't think it's possible

1527
05:29:55,130 --> 05:30:02,500
to fight the boss. Not yet. At least maybe in a few, in a few moments. It's possible.

1528
05:30:03,139 --> 05:30:15,500
Money pit is 26 minutes. We will see that again at least one more time. This guy no longer laughs.

1529
05:30:16,380 --> 05:30:32,459
Let's test it. Let's see if I've actually achieved true focus. Here we go.

1530
05:30:32,459 --> 05:30:55,450
I've achieved it. That would have the, the unascended me would have laughed at that last

1531
05:30:55,450 --> 05:31:24,220
one because it was so abrupt. And now I need screaming. Okay. Let's try. It's not going to do

1532
05:31:24,220 --> 05:31:36,200
anything. That was close. That was very close, but I've ascended. Yeah. That would have, that's what

1533
05:31:36,680 --> 05:31:55,779
it's. All right. Let's just play the game. There's only somebody. Oh, it's still going too fast.

1534
05:31:56,580 --> 05:32:13,029
It was the three. It was the, it was the third, just the same person. All right. That's it. I'm

1535
05:32:13,029 --> 05:32:31,909
ready. I need music though. What the fuck am I doing? Okay. So yeah, let's go back here. I'm

1536
05:32:31,909 --> 05:32:35,349
going to, I'm going to, let's just do it now. I'm not waiting 15 moments for this shit.

1537
05:32:37,700 --> 05:32:49,369
Toughness. What do we got? I can do a bunch into the cube and now that puts it at 13,

1538
05:32:49,369 --> 05:33:03,479
maxed out, combine all this shit. Looking good. Cube, all the cubes just put them together.

1539
05:33:07,110 --> 05:33:14,220
Special, right? Wait a minute. You, what did that say? That said something.

1540
05:33:15,020 --> 05:33:34,139
Dragon. What did that say? It said, that said a new cube. Infinity cube. You should probably

1541
05:33:34,139 --> 05:33:49,540
boost your equipment first before boosting the cube. What should I eat? You guys have any ideas

1542
05:33:49,540 --> 05:34:08,520
what I should have for food? I need some good food ideas. Chicken sandwich. Maybe. All right.

1543
05:34:08,520 --> 05:34:19,619
Let's, let's ascend. This is going to be a big, big fucking deal. 450 million. Get a poke bowl.

1544
05:34:20,340 --> 05:34:29,130
I'm actually not a big fan of raw tuna. Not really. It's, it's all right. I'd rather have it

1545
05:34:29,130 --> 05:34:45,029
as a spicy tuna roll. A poke bowl. But I like spicy tuna, but I don't like it. I don't, you

1546
05:34:45,029 --> 05:34:52,459
don't get the big red fatty tuna like sushi. Try to just wait the, no. Rebirth. Let's do it.

1547
05:34:56,779 --> 05:35:03,479
This is now going to be ridiculous. Like absolutely ridiculous. Microism cereal.

1548
05:35:04,119 --> 05:35:13,299
You're trying to gross me out. Okay. Rebirth. 450 million. Now we can, I, I could nuke.

1549
05:35:13,299 --> 05:35:21,939
I don't have any, I don't have any points. Let's do just, why is that taking so long?

1550
05:35:23,479 --> 05:35:32,729
All right. Okay. We're already at eight trillion attack. Just in case anyone was curious. Boom,

1551
05:35:32,729 --> 05:35:39,180
boom, boom, boom, boom. I don't want to nuke. I like to see how far we go. So we're at 20 trillion

1552
05:35:39,180 --> 05:35:47,639
attack. He's got 120. We've got plenty. Just drain them down. I've got an image to look at.

1553
05:35:48,279 --> 05:36:00,090
I'll never look at that one again. Thank you though. Uh, adventure. I'm, I'm going to get

1554
05:36:00,090 --> 05:36:08,459
very close to being able to do this shit. What else has special? This does. I got the money

1555
05:36:08,459 --> 05:36:21,860
pitback fight boss. Uh, cap is going up. Oh yeah. You got, you guys got full of, this is what this,

1556
05:36:21,860 --> 05:36:29,060
you guys are full of photos. So tomorrow, we're not done yet, but tomorrow I am going to,

1557
05:36:33,529 --> 05:36:40,340
what the fuck? It's just the idol face. German idol. Uh, tomorrow is possible that it'll be

1558
05:36:40,340 --> 05:36:45,299
the community night. You'll find out very soon. Uh, tomorrow I'll be here tomorrow morning,

1559
05:36:45,299 --> 05:36:50,259
early kind of afternoonish, early morningish, uh, to tell you what, if there's enough,

1560
05:36:50,979 --> 05:36:53,459
if there's enough, we're going to do the community night. And what is the community night? The

1561
05:36:53,459 --> 05:37:02,409
community night is the new monthly or bi-monthly stream where we hang out for a few hours and we

1562
05:37:02,409 --> 05:37:06,330
go over a bunch of community artwork, a bunch of community videos, a bunch of anything. That's

1563
05:37:06,330 --> 05:37:11,049
just original community content. It doesn't just have to be art. It's not necessarily an artwork

1564
05:37:11,049 --> 05:37:18,599
showcase. It's an everything showcase and we just chill. And maybe I'll do a coloring book.

1565
05:37:19,159 --> 05:37:34,250
Maybe I'll do a coloring book on stream. What is cracked? Oh, movie night. Yeah, kind of is.

1566
05:37:34,250 --> 05:37:56,259
It's kind of a movie night. If there was a police officer that wanted to guaranteed write like

1567
05:37:57,590 --> 05:38:01,590
50 tickets a day, guarantee, and we're talking absolute guarantee.

1568
05:38:02,889 --> 05:38:20,779
Hang out over there. Oh, I need music. What else we got? I'm just going to go next, next,

1569
05:38:20,779 --> 05:38:26,700
next on Lego Island until there's something else. Next, next, next, next, next, next, next.

1570
05:38:27,419 --> 05:38:38,279
Okay. This is, I guess another, this is also Lego related, which is called the catchy song.

1571
05:39:05,450 --> 05:39:14,939
No, no, no. Excuse me. I'm sorry. I call bullshit on that one because here's the original.

1572
05:39:22,419 --> 05:39:31,740
And yes, it goes on and on my friend. Some people started singing it, not knowing why

1573
05:39:31,740 --> 05:39:41,540
did you sing that instantly? Don't wait. Don't you come over here and she's like, oh, stop this

1574
05:39:41,540 --> 05:39:48,259
nonsense. That's enough. I got off with that song, please. No more. No more of this song.

1575
05:39:49,220 --> 05:39:53,299
Nothing in here. Let's prove it. There ain't fucking anything in here.

1576
05:39:55,959 --> 05:40:04,619
Turn off that song. Some people started singing it, not knowing what it was,

1577
05:40:04,619 --> 05:40:13,500
but we'll continue singing it forever. Just because the song that doesn't end the fuck out

1578
05:40:13,500 --> 05:40:34,139
of here with I'm done with that. This is a great cup though. I will say, you know, people do like,

1579
05:40:34,139 --> 05:40:37,819
oh, I'm going to watch this video for an hour or the 10 hour version or whatever. You've never

1580
05:40:37,819 --> 05:40:43,639
seen anybody watch that one. Maybe you have. Is that like a subset of YouTube or Twitch or

1581
05:40:43,639 --> 05:40:52,490
something that I don't know about? All right. I got a lot of, let's do this. Gorgonzola. Wait a

1582
05:40:52,490 --> 05:40:59,349
minute. This is 18. I just, I did it. I got to, I cut to 18. Augmentation feature unlock. Go check

1583
05:40:59,349 --> 05:41:03,990
it out on the features. A new adventure zone has also been unlocked. The forest, exhausted, bruised,

1584
05:41:03,990 --> 05:41:08,630
and slightly deaf from explosion. You hobble into this mysterious hut. And indeed this seems

1585
05:41:08,630 --> 05:41:14,599
to be the home of the wizard, whoever he is. You see the stereotypical bubbling cauldron,

1586
05:41:14,599 --> 05:41:18,919
various gross magical ingredients, and oddly enough, dozens of empty cans of compressed air

1587
05:41:18,919 --> 05:41:33,880
laying on the floor. Like, wait, why? Uh, okay. However, the bug-eyed wizard has caught your

1588
05:41:33,880 --> 05:41:40,060
attention as he whoops maniacally, greeting you like an old friend. With your memory lost,

1589
05:41:40,060 --> 05:41:46,459
you just take him at his word that you knew each other. Okay. He claims he can help you if you had,

1590
05:41:46,459 --> 05:41:51,259
if you'd head through what he calls the hazy cave just behind his home and gather some of

1591
05:41:51,259 --> 05:41:57,419
that good stuff. Whatever that is. Feeling unusually merciful, you agree to help and set off

1592
05:41:57,419 --> 05:42:02,540
into the cave. Be prepared for anything that in the cave there, fella. The weird gases in there

1593
05:42:02,540 --> 05:42:07,209
make you go a little loopy. And if you need a little something something to get stronger,

1594
05:42:07,209 --> 05:42:11,369
see Mr. Jensen. Just a couple of houses down, he'll hook you up with some of what he calls

1595
05:42:11,369 --> 05:42:16,330
augmentations. It's weird sci-fi mumbo jumbo, but I can't deny that it works.

1596
05:42:17,049 --> 05:42:31,430
Augmentation. Unlock by defeating Gorgon. Next augment, so this is a gold sink. Base stat multiplier

1597
05:42:31,430 --> 05:42:57,500
one. Wait, energy alo- energy allocated? What? Really? Let's get that up. Well, that's only

1598
05:42:57,500 --> 05:43:04,869
halfway there. You use energy to build it up and it adds a multiplier. That's cool. This is a fun

1599
05:43:04,869 --> 05:43:18,599
game. Let's pull this down now. Okay, I gotta do increments of like 200 now or 100 at least.

1600
05:43:24,919 --> 05:43:31,259
Alright, we're at 3000. What's my actual cap now? 3757. That's pretty good. That doubles attack and

1601
05:43:31,259 --> 05:43:36,950
defense. I have, speaking of attack and defense, quadrillion. Almost nine- eight quadrillion.

1602
05:43:37,590 --> 05:43:43,349
So I can do damage. I'm about to kill Gorgonzola right now and I'm going to get the artifact.

1603
05:43:43,990 --> 05:43:51,189
You're having more fun with this this clicking game than with the lava game. I feel like we're

1604
05:43:51,189 --> 05:43:56,939
kind of past the point of no return with this one. And I mean, I'm only going to be streaming

1605
05:43:57,580 --> 05:44:05,189
I don't know. I did it. Yes, you're fighting sentient cheeses now. Yes, it's probably the gas.

1606
05:44:05,189 --> 05:44:09,930
No, you should not let this cheese or anything else in this cave live. This one is armed with

1607
05:44:09,930 --> 05:44:16,950
a massive crossbow. How is it even able to fire the damn thing? I don't know. But I just got

1608
05:44:17,750 --> 05:44:31,130
safety scissors. Time left to complete the augment. Oh, I get it. 11 minutes.

1609
05:44:33,720 --> 05:44:39,659
Shit. Okay. Um, I have to build them. Let's go into the sewers though, because I-

1610
05:44:43,939 --> 05:44:48,549
Uh, I don't want to listen to that, but that's fine. I need gold. I need gold. I need gold.

1611
05:44:48,549 --> 05:44:50,869
Why am I not getting gold? Because I'm not doing adventuring. That's why.

1612
05:44:51,669 --> 05:45:03,020
That's what's going on here. This is an ad or is this the actual- no, this is the actual thing.

1613
05:45:03,020 --> 05:45:10,700
Okay. So let's go to adventure. I'm in the forest. These things are way too powerful. I don't think

1614
05:45:10,700 --> 05:45:19,939
I can do the forest. This is going to be tricky. I might get something good for this though. Let's

1615
05:45:19,939 --> 05:45:28,229
see. 3900 gold. You've defeated a goblin. 3344. I mean, I'm- I need more max HP. Bad.

1616
05:45:34,180 --> 05:45:43,479
Fairy has defeated you. Right. How am I doing on this fight? 11 and 13. Not really enough.

1617
05:45:44,119 --> 05:45:56,819
Let's go all the way. Cap that shit up. All right. 10k levels in previous attack,

1618
05:45:56,819 --> 05:46:00,520
which is not going to happen anytime soon. I'm just going to put it into here.

1619
05:46:00,840 --> 05:46:13,659
What's the point? All right. Looks good. So 11. I need 10,000 gold, which I almost have.

1620
05:46:13,659 --> 05:46:24,869
Adventure. Let's try it again. Forest. Good. This should be easy. A lot of HP though. Orc.

1621
05:46:25,590 --> 05:46:43,020
Is that a Mario Yahtzee in the background? Orc dropped a toughness boost 2 and 4300 gold.

1622
05:46:44,869 --> 05:47:02,009
Toughness boost- wait. Is it working? Didn't I have money? I thought- Z. Bonus 2 bonus.

1623
05:47:02,650 --> 05:47:13,939
Oh shit. Okay. Axel. Toughness. None of these needed. Toughness 2. Here we go. In the boots.

1624
05:47:15,740 --> 05:47:18,939
Advancing back to the adventure. Did I die? No, I'm good. I need 10 grand.

1625
05:47:19,740 --> 05:47:39,990
10 grand. Here we go. Augmentation. 10,000 gold. Time left to complete. 10 minutes.

1626
05:47:40,790 --> 05:47:46,380
Let's get some- no. Let's make that easier. I don't want to wait around 10 minutes. Are you

1627
05:47:46,380 --> 05:48:02,619
kidding me? 3 minutes. All right. 39 quadrillion. Uh oh. I don't really have enough.

1628
05:48:03,580 --> 05:48:09,750
What do I get for rebirth? This is going up like crazy. All right. At 15 minutes this is

1629
05:48:09,750 --> 05:48:19,659
going to be insane. Get milk infusion. Base stat multiplier 25. Marinating your bones in

1630
05:48:19,659 --> 05:48:35,369
milk for 6 hours should toughen them up. 200,000 gold. Is that 22 hours or 22 minutes? 22 minutes.

1631
05:48:35,369 --> 05:48:43,060
Good. Okay. Experience. I'm going to wait for- I want to do this at- I'll do it right now.

1632
05:48:46,900 --> 05:48:56,310
No money pit. Not worth it. 22 minutes if you use all of your energy. Okay.

1633
05:48:57,430 --> 05:49:05,430
Jerma, stop- you need to stop playing this game. Only tonight? And maybe leave my computer on

1634
05:49:05,430 --> 05:49:13,189
overnight and just play this and just not stream it but try to get to the vacation.

1635
05:49:13,909 --> 05:49:31,849
Jerma, please. Please, Jerma, please. We'll- you'll fine. We're fine. Inventory. All right.

1636
05:49:39,750 --> 05:49:50,119
Can I combine this? No. That's 20 attack power. So this thing is junk now. Get rid of it.

1637
05:49:50,759 --> 05:50:01,479
It's a wooden sword. This is junk too. Get rid of this too. I'm never going to put this on. All

1638
05:50:01,479 --> 05:50:06,119
right. Now I can do adventure. Let's see. Forest. I should be doing much more damage

1639
05:50:06,119 --> 05:50:24,180
now. It's funny because Link doesn't talk. RIP 100 set bonus. What do you mean 100 set bonus?

1640
05:50:24,819 --> 05:50:36,860
3800 gold. What about my augmentation? Almost there. 41 seconds. This stream is the longest

1641
05:50:36,860 --> 05:50:50,459
worst joke of 2019. This is- this is not a joke to me. This is- this is a game I'm playing.

1642
05:50:53,340 --> 05:51:03,529
This is my- I want to play this game. Not everything's gotta be a joke. You understand?

1643
05:51:05,540 --> 05:51:11,849
Here. Just take that last bit. Just take that last little bit. Sip it. Come on. Get it. Nice.

1644
05:51:12,490 --> 05:51:24,680
Wow, you got it. Nice work. Why am I doing that? I didn't spill it. There's no- I don't got anything.

1645
05:51:24,680 --> 05:51:35,860
I got a safety scissor. Sick. So my stats- 43 go- oh, at least shit. Hold on. Well, all right.

1646
05:51:35,860 --> 05:51:44,310
Well, now you die. You put creamer in your coffee. It depends on what kind of coffee it is. Ice coffee

1647
05:51:44,310 --> 05:51:57,849
I do usually do almond milk. All right, I got the brie. This cheese is named after a city in the

1648
05:51:57,849 --> 05:52:03,849
Netherlands. Knowing that, this is going to be a tough fight. 1.9 quintillion. Quintillion.

1649
05:52:05,159 --> 05:52:11,659
It's- yeah, it's absolutely double the stats. That's fucking pretty good. How am I doing in

1650
05:52:11,659 --> 05:52:19,319
adventure mode? What do we got? Anything else? Just a one? Put it in here. 51 power now.

1651
05:52:22,439 --> 05:52:31,659
Sextillion incoming. Yeah. I got 2.6 billion. I have to rebirth again right now. I have to.

1652
05:52:31,659 --> 05:52:37,419
Like, why would I not? And then when we- when we- then- and then the stream ends.

1653
05:52:38,060 --> 05:52:45,049
I think so. That sounds like a plan to me. Sextillion. Yeah, sextillion. It's- you don't

1654
05:52:45,049 --> 05:53:02,810
know what sextillion? Here comes the end of the stream voice. Uh oh. What is my issue? Do I have

1655
05:53:02,810 --> 05:53:16,389
one? Do I have an issue? I don't think I do. Do I have one? Tell me if I do. So I can get- I'm

1656
05:53:16,389 --> 05:53:24,630
getting more of these. 20,000 gold. Holy- that's insane. I can do this again? Milk infusion. That's

1657
05:53:24,630 --> 05:53:31,000
20 minutes. I'm gonna rebirth. I don't know if I keep that though. Do I- I don't think I keep this.

1658
05:53:31,900 --> 05:53:43,880
No, this ain't gonna happen. 100 quadrillion? No. No way. Would I tell you guys if I shit myself

1659
05:53:43,880 --> 05:53:49,000
on stream? Yeah, because I would have to leave. I would be like, guys, I have to leave. I have- I

1660
05:53:49,000 --> 05:53:53,080
have had a small accident, is what I would say. I'd say I had a little accident. And then I would

1661
05:53:53,080 --> 05:53:57,900
leave. I would just leave. I'm not gonna sit here. But that's never gonna happen. But yes, I would.

1662
05:53:57,900 --> 05:54:02,380
I would tell you guys that there was an accident on- like, I had a small accident and I have to go.

1663
05:54:03,099 --> 05:54:31,560
That's all there is to it. So, um, I have to leave very soon here. What am I gonna eat for food?

1664
05:54:32,439 --> 05:54:42,970
You guys have to help me decide this. Let's go back to the forest. We have to break it down first.

1665
05:54:43,689 --> 05:54:50,680
There is- let's go over some genres. I want genre first. Buffalo chicken wings. That- you know what?

1666
05:54:50,680 --> 05:55:00,950
I think you just nailed it. You nailed it. You did. Yeah, you nailed it. Thanks a lot. Appreciate the

1667
05:55:00,950 --> 05:55:10,169
help. Oh, I know exactly where I'm gonna get them from too. Hash house or go-go? From the Link. I

1668
05:55:10,169 --> 05:55:27,400
wonder if they even have them. Special boost 1. Stylish. Ooh. Skeleton. 51. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1669
05:55:27,400 --> 05:55:35,819
Rebirth. 3 billion. All right, it's time. It's time. It's time. It's time. I have to do it.

1670
05:55:37,459 --> 05:55:41,669
Doing this one more time and then I'm gonna go get food. And then I'll see you guys tomorrow.

1671
05:55:45,990 --> 05:56:03,189
Yeah, I will. He'll see me tomorrow. He shit himself. We're not gonna see you again. I'm

1672
05:56:03,189 --> 05:56:06,630
gonna stream tomorrow. I'm gonna stream tomorrow at like 1 o'clock Pacific.

1673
05:56:07,590 --> 05:56:21,000
All right, experience. Let's do- no. Here comes a rebirth. I got it. 6.5 billion.

1674
05:56:21,720 --> 05:56:32,259
Do it. Bang. This is where it gets wild. They're- hold on a minute. Max energy on this rebirth is

1675
05:56:32,259 --> 05:56:52,009
capped at 3900. On re- okay. All right, nice. Hold on. Trillion already? Already 7- 100 trillion.

1676
05:56:54,299 --> 05:57:03,049
Let's see. I haven't done a nuke all day. Nuke. Down at the fast zombie. Nuke. I can't. He killed

1677
05:57:03,049 --> 05:57:21,099
me. You motherfucker. You killed me. Yeah, it's time to eat food soon. Food isn't coming. I'm

1678
05:57:21,099 --> 05:57:27,639
gonna be- no. He killed me again. All right, so we're doing all right. You know, I'll tell you

1679
05:57:27,639 --> 05:57:34,009
something. I had a blast on today's stream. I had a fucking great time. This was a lot of fun.

1680
05:57:34,650 --> 05:57:45,590
Sometimes it don't matter what the game is. We make our own damn fun. I'm glad somebody did.

1681
05:57:47,290 --> 05:58:05,220
Easy. Easy. Easy. I'm admitting this is a bad stream. What? What are you talking about? This

1682
05:58:05,220 --> 05:58:09,299
is like the- I had- I've had like the- I had- I played Hitman yesterday and had a different kind

1683
05:58:09,299 --> 05:58:19,830
of fun. I had a lot of fun today. What are you talking about? It's got a pants blast.

1684
05:58:20,790 --> 05:58:35,220
It is a fucking mess, so I've gotta go. I've never heard that term before. It's a pants blast.

1685
05:58:36,020 --> 05:59:00,599
You guys are sick. Look at that. It's like lightning. Oh, already a quadrillion. Skip it.

1686
05:59:01,080 --> 05:59:07,159
Skip it. Skip it. No, not this one. All right, augmentation. I lost my augmentation though.

1687
05:59:16,759 --> 05:59:26,680
Yeah, this does hurt my eyes. I need full HP. Yeah, I also need to do this too. I need this

1688
05:59:26,680 --> 05:59:36,090
to get this. I need defense. Uh, adventuring is also important right now too. What do I- inventory?

1689
05:59:36,090 --> 05:59:42,729
Nothing? What is- 10, 10. No, there's no reason for me to- just get rid of this. I don't need to-

1690
05:59:42,729 --> 06:00:04,520
why do I need to hold on to this? There's a dark mode? Holy shit. You need to buy the ascended

1691
06:00:04,520 --> 06:00:15,189
newbie pack in the sellout shop to turn this on. Oh, that's great. I said that four hours ago. It

1692
06:00:15,189 --> 06:00:21,110
wasn't- it wasn't nighttime four hours ago. It was three o'clock pacific time. The sun is still

1693
06:00:21,110 --> 06:00:36,680
shining. I don't need dark mode then. It's later now. All right, now I can do this. It's 20,000

1694
06:00:36,680 --> 06:00:45,990

Kill it. Kill it. Kill it. Kill it. Kill it. Kill it. Nice. Did it. They beat level 37. Oh my god,

1696
06:01:00,540 --> 06:01:07,959

1722
06:05:34,939 --> 06:05:54,819
come on I'm saying this bump too bad this Sonic game sucked that Sonic game

1723
06:05:54,819 --> 06:05:59,860
sucked there hasn't been a good Sonic the Hedgehog game in probably about 12

1724
06:05:59,860 --> 06:06:16,869
years but uh hold on people saying Sonic mania but Sonic mania is just a

1725
06:06:16,869 --> 06:06:21,689
compilation of all the other good ones Sonic mania Sonic mania they just like

1726
06:06:21,689 --> 06:06:24,250
did they said hey this is I have Sonic the Hedgehog one two and three are great

1727
06:06:24,250 --> 06:06:28,259
let's like kind of make that again and redo them all I mean no it's not is my

1728
06:06:28,259 --> 06:06:35,619
gut that do I have that wrong what's the one where they just remade the first

1729
06:06:35,619 --> 06:06:46,319
like three games and call it something else they never did that just wait

1730
06:06:46,319 --> 06:06:58,290
generations there it is there okay I was wrong Sonic mania it's just this is just

1731
06:06:58,290 --> 06:07:09,459
Sonic the Hedgehog they just remade it how's it what is the same game is this a

1732
06:07:09,459 --> 06:07:18,090
remake of like the first one generations is that game it is this has new levels

1733
06:07:18,090 --> 06:07:26,110
so it's a new game with the old palette okay all right okay all right I was

1734
06:07:26,110 --> 06:07:31,919
wrong that's fine I was wrong I was thinking of generations okay when they

1735
06:07:31,919 --> 06:07:40,290
come out 2016 all right okay all right okay yep okay I'm corrected that's fine

1736
06:07:40,290 --> 06:07:57,819
okay I got two of these now good that's all I want all right boss time basic

1737
06:07:57,819 --> 06:08:05,500
training let's get it in there tap it wait is it they get you don't even

1738
06:08:05,500 --> 06:08:20,000
flashing anymore they should make another classic Sonic game I don't know

1739
06:08:20,000 --> 06:08:29,470
what they should do with Sonic cuz it Sonic soda has like an unfair unfair

1740
06:08:29,470 --> 06:08:33,950
weight put on them I think for some reason and I'll give you an example well

1741
06:08:33,950 --> 06:08:40,500
now it's it's so Mario when they make a Mario game it's still like Super Mario

1742
06:08:40,500 --> 06:08:45,439
it's still you know like a plug most of them almost all of my platforms right so

1743
06:08:45,439 --> 06:08:50,680
if you make a Mario game you make six seven eight nine ten Mario games I'm

1744
06:08:50,720 --> 06:08:54,720
talking the last ten years that are essentially jump from spot to spot right

1745
06:08:54,720 --> 06:09:00,159
Sonic the Hedgehog is just I go very fast but I go very fast has not stood

1746
06:09:00,159 --> 06:09:07,799
the test of time that jump from spot to spot has so what the what that's kind of

1747
06:09:07,799 --> 06:09:20,569
how do you go really fast in 2020 you kind of can and let's just racing game

1748
06:09:20,569 --> 06:09:28,869
they could have taken Sonic and made it is its own it's like Mario Kart type

1749
06:09:28,909 --> 06:09:34,599
game I know they did they did Sonic races but I'm talking like completely

1750
06:09:34,599 --> 06:09:41,650
transitioned the whole entire character into this is a racing game not like oh

1751
06:09:41,650 --> 06:09:47,389
let's go back and do Sonic unleashed Sonic colors Sonic we go fast this way

1752
06:09:47,389 --> 06:09:51,889
no just have it be your race it's a race have to be like that don't touch the

1753
06:09:51,889 --> 06:09:55,250
floor lava game except it's it's Sonic the Hedgehog and you got to move fast

1754
06:09:55,250 --> 06:10:02,119
and bunny hop and put it on PC and stuff I don't know I do I remember colors

1755
06:10:02,119 --> 06:10:08,049
wasn't really not that bad though because Mario has a bunch of these

1756
06:10:08,049 --> 06:10:16,290
gimmicks right but they work gravity big gimmick right Mario Galaxy this you jump

1757
06:10:16,290 --> 06:10:19,849
from the planets you run around a circle is like a gravity okay that's cool that

1758
06:10:19,849 --> 06:10:23,209
worked because you jump around and gravity works when you jump you land

1759
06:10:23,209 --> 06:10:28,119
back on the ground in Sonic unleashed their Mario Galaxy type scenario was

1760
06:10:28,119 --> 06:10:34,279
turn into a werewolf that doesn't make doesn't that does not add anything to

1761
06:10:34,279 --> 06:10:41,930
going fast in fact werewolf a werewolf is slow they're not that fast if you've

1762
06:10:41,930 --> 06:10:45,169
seen Twilight the vampires run much faster than the werewolves because they

1763
06:10:45,169 --> 06:10:51,380
have like the super duper lightning like super speed so and then didn't they

1764
06:10:51,380 --> 06:10:54,580
they did a they did like he did it but they gave him like a sword and a shield

1765
06:10:54,580 --> 06:11:01,250
in one of them he had like a fucking he was like a knight right that that does

1766
06:11:01,250 --> 06:11:09,259
not make going fast more interesting Mario um Mario Galaxy right Mario

1767
06:11:09,340 --> 06:11:14,380
Odyssey Mario Odyssey they gave him this hat the gimmick you could throw the hat

1768
06:11:14,380 --> 06:11:18,900
on stuff and control it and it was interesting and it added way more

1769
06:11:18,900 --> 06:11:24,520
dynamic to jumping up and down on stuff they should have just given Sonic a

1770
06:11:24,520 --> 06:11:30,270
fucking car just give him a car and just make a taxi game or something I don't

1771
06:11:30,270 --> 06:11:36,740
know they did but I mean I mean in every game like you know once when Mario gets

1772
06:11:36,740 --> 06:11:40,619
a picks up the the fire plant and you can shoot fire out of his hands and

1773
06:11:40,619 --> 06:11:43,180
that's the gimmick have to be a thing that you pick up and it's Sonic goes in

1774
06:11:43,180 --> 06:11:46,139
the car and it's a super cool like Batmobile type car and it goes like 500

1775
06:11:46,139 --> 06:11:52,200
miles per hour and you bet you do the level in the car anything that goes

1776
06:11:52,200 --> 06:11:55,400
really fast like train have him like turn to a train or have him get in the

1777
06:11:55,400 --> 06:11:58,360
train and go really fast and train have him getting like you know he can fly

1778
06:11:58,360 --> 06:12:03,430
turns into a helicopter I don't know what things go really fucking fast you don't

1779
06:12:03,430 --> 06:12:39,880
slow him down you make him go faster that sounds awful but still Mario has

1780
06:12:39,880 --> 06:12:46,400
gimmicks that quantum that they they add to him jumping up and down Sonic

1781
06:12:46,400 --> 06:12:52,299
keeps taking things away from how fast he goes have a time travel have a Sonic

1782
06:12:52,299 --> 06:12:55,340
the fucking hedgehog time travel game where he goes too fast in the beginning

1783
06:12:55,340 --> 06:12:58,580
the opening cutscene he goes way too fast and he goes like 200 years in the

1784
06:12:58,580 --> 06:13:11,650
future or something they did that oh well I'm gonna go so fast it goes back

1785
06:13:11,650 --> 06:13:17,340
in time if they had to go back in time oh they've done all options then you

1786
06:13:17,340 --> 06:13:21,419
time travel going fast or that's pretty much the only gimmick you can do okay

1787
06:13:21,419 --> 06:13:24,419
they did it with how it was again hum what was it rated

1788
06:13:24,419 --> 06:13:36,299
Sonic CD generations and CD or I got a better idea Sega make another super

1789
06:13:36,299 --> 06:13:43,590
monkey ball game and add Sonic as a fucking collectible character he moves

1790
06:13:43,590 --> 06:13:47,709
fast in that thing they are okay they're doing that too they're on the right

1791
06:13:47,709 --> 06:13:52,630
track they're on the right track good here's Sonic and the Black Knight exactly

1792
06:13:52,630 --> 06:14:03,479
we were just talking about this is called Night of the Wind not bad all

1793
06:14:03,479 --> 06:14:13,060
right blue cheese did you know that this stuff has mold in it gross I love blue

1794
06:14:13,060 --> 06:14:17,860
cheese and I'm gonna have a shitload of it in like 20 minutes all right what I

1795
06:14:17,860 --> 06:14:23,540
need to whatever got capped out here 39 9 augmentation what do I need for milk

1796
06:14:23,540 --> 06:14:30,799
let's make some milk I need 200,000 gold back to adventure mode

1797
06:14:31,000 --> 06:14:37,330
buffalo wings and blue cheese oh yeah you have no idea I'm gonna eat too many

1798
06:14:37,330 --> 06:14:40,729
of those tonight I'm gonna have so many it's gonna be ridiculous texting me

1799
06:14:40,729 --> 06:14:56,930
whoo energy yeah I'm gonna have the whole outfit on forest helmet power so

1800
06:14:56,930 --> 06:15:03,900
this is all right these are not trash toughness 47 let's take a look adventure

1801
06:15:03,900 --> 06:15:15,069
you make me hungry I'm making myself hungry what if Sonic went to the

1802
06:15:15,069 --> 06:15:25,150
Olympics yes that would be interesting wouldn't it or what if they just took

1803
06:15:25,150 --> 06:15:30,880
away the whole Sonic goes really fast because that you always have to worry

1804
06:15:30,880 --> 06:15:34,279
about the fact that at some point during the game when you're walking around

1805
06:15:34,279 --> 06:15:39,439
you're gonna just start going 500 miles per hour what if he gets cursed at the

1806
06:15:39,439 --> 06:15:42,799
beginning of one of the games by dr. Robotnik throws like a curse at him and

1807
06:15:42,799 --> 06:15:46,319
he's oh I can't run fast anymore and now you just have to play a different game

1808
06:15:46,360 --> 06:15:54,020
they that's what they did that's they did that already why is Sonic the

1809
06:15:54,020 --> 06:16:06,200
Simpsons have they done everything they tried everything those games they've

1810
06:16:06,200 --> 06:16:20,159
already made well give him a fucking TV show in a CG movie that's the final step

1811
06:16:20,159 --> 06:16:24,200
there no way getting more games just turn it into a cartoon network show I

1812
06:16:24,200 --> 06:16:29,759
know about them yes the movie yes I know the movie I know about the movie that's

1813
06:16:29,759 --> 06:16:37,450
why I said the movie and no the TV show yes the tip that I know that shit yes I

1814
06:16:37,569 --> 06:16:42,549
know that's the end that's the end game that's how you ended and then that's

1815
06:16:42,549 --> 06:16:47,400
gonna run for like fucking 35 seasons and then Sega is gonna they went from

1816
06:16:47,400 --> 06:16:53,520
making hardware consoles to we don't make consoles anymore to now we make

1817
06:16:53,520 --> 06:16:57,080
games only but now we don't make games anymore now we just make TV shows and

1818
06:16:57,080 --> 06:17:18,209
they're gonna just bake cartoons in 20 years Sonic Souls born might be

1819
06:17:18,209 --> 06:17:25,250
interesting you've moved really fast that might be their plan

1820
06:17:25,490 --> 06:17:38,799
but Sega does have a lot of great properties though what Sega's number

1821
06:17:38,799 --> 06:17:54,409
besides Sonic Sega has House of the Dead Sonic Yakuza okay what what else but I'm

1822
06:17:54,409 --> 06:17:57,290
talking like relevant series that have like they've had of something to come

1823
06:17:57,290 --> 06:18:03,119
out in the last few years Monkey Ball but Monkey Ball well technically is

1824
06:18:03,119 --> 06:18:09,799
then they're making one right Parmesan you're seriously debating taking this

1825
06:18:09,799 --> 06:18:13,520
cheese as future corpse with you to grate over some pasta that sounds good

1826
06:18:13,520 --> 06:18:22,310
too I blame the game because of all the food shit and important to note here

1827
06:18:22,310 --> 06:18:29,709
very very quickly Sega has been getting into the slot machine business because

1828
06:18:29,709 --> 06:18:42,319

1853
06:22:16,000 --> 06:22:19,860
wish it was have any video games released in the last like week or two

1854
06:22:19,860 --> 06:22:29,240
that have been worth playing I have code vain people but people keep telling me

1855
06:22:29,240 --> 06:22:43,779
that that's not very good we have to figure that out on our own code vain is

1856
06:22:43,779 --> 06:22:51,959
so bad really planet Zoo yeah planets isn't beta though it's that that I want

1857
06:22:51,959 --> 06:22:59,810
to play when it's actually out and release completely oh this is good this

1858
06:22:59,810 --> 06:23:09,939

1859
06:23:09,939 --> 06:23:40,330
part play Uno I don't even know how now that's it that's all the only thing I'm

1860
06:23:40,330 --> 06:23:44,630
really wanted to hear in this song the song is seven minutes long but only

1861
06:23:44,630 --> 06:23:48,880
that's like that that's like the 12 seconds that I like if I've heard this

1862
06:23:48,880 --> 06:23:52,840
I've played this song off straight before and sat and watched you know if

1863
06:23:52,840 --> 06:23:56,520
you go into YouTube analytics you can see there's a line that shows you when

1864
06:23:56,520 --> 06:23:59,919
people watched in rewind and it'll show you that the time that what that had the

1865
06:23:59,919 --> 06:24:06,200
most retention I alone have probably made that bar like 60% higher on this

1866
06:24:06,200 --> 06:24:10,200
video because I've rewound this probably I did this spot right there like

1867
06:24:10,200 --> 06:24:37,290
probably two to three thousand times okay I need 200k two to three thousand

1868
06:24:37,290 --> 06:24:42,470
probably because I think about it if I do it what you didn't you know if you

1869
06:24:42,470 --> 06:24:46,509
guys don't realize when you listen to a song and not just with this song but any

1870
06:24:46,509 --> 06:24:50,750
song that you actually like you would be surprised if you were being tracked

1871
06:24:50,750 --> 06:24:57,119
without you knowing like you just bugged yourself essentially right you'd be

1872
06:24:57,119 --> 06:25:01,200
surprised at how many times you actually go back and listen to the same thing over

1873
06:25:01,200 --> 06:25:04,200
and over again oh yeah I heard that I listened to that for a little while you

1874
06:25:04,200 --> 06:25:15,080
look over it's been 27 minutes and you've been on like the same song or

1875
06:25:15,080 --> 06:25:19,939
did I just admit to you that I'm a psychopath I'm not sure which one of

1876
06:25:19,939 --> 06:25:45,990
those things is it is I don't know both just kidding all right augmentation I

1877
06:25:45,990 --> 06:25:53,840
almost have it 16 minutes I need 200,000 gold almost there and then I'm gonna do

1878
06:25:53,840 --> 06:25:56,740
something for 16 minutes before the stream ends that's the final thing I'm

1879
06:25:56,740 --> 06:26:07,000
doing 48 billion pretty good this is gonna double here in a second no good

1880
06:26:07,000 --> 06:26:16,299
games until the Outer Worlds comes out yeah I mean I what there are no there

1881
06:26:16,299 --> 06:26:27,259
like what games have released what about greed fall no I thought about green fault

1882
06:26:27,259 --> 06:26:31,060
from with green fall is just it's gonna be one of those scenarios it's gonna

1883
06:26:31,060 --> 06:26:38,819
bore the hell out of me I know it is I was thinking about it but I just see

1884
06:26:38,819 --> 06:26:44,380
myself sitting there for a couple hours and then I just don't want to pick all

1885
06:26:44,380 --> 06:26:49,459
the dialogue options it kind of looks like it's a Mass Effect II where you got

1886
06:26:49,459 --> 06:26:54,099
like five minutes of combat and exploration and gameplay and then like

1887
06:26:54,099 --> 06:27:09,419
30 minutes of story and go talk to all the people in town is that accurate yes

1888
06:27:09,419 --> 06:27:14,099
okay yeah it's just not I know a lot of people like that stuff and that's fine

1889
06:27:14,099 --> 06:27:19,419
that's that's cool I'm not gonna tell you that that's not a good game it's just

1890
06:27:19,419 --> 06:27:27,270
not usually what I find to be very interesting I don't do well not I'm not

1891
06:27:27,270 --> 06:27:29,990
even talking on stream like oh no let's do it off stream but do you even off

1892
06:27:29,990 --> 06:27:37,750
stream right it doesn't click with me really at all you should play dicey

1893
06:27:37,750 --> 06:27:44,330
dungeons I've heard that was very good you would not like earthbound well

1894
06:27:44,330 --> 06:27:48,770
earthbound is different because earthbound is that's a that's like an

1895
06:27:48,770 --> 06:27:54,930
RPG it's like a turn-based RPG and there's a lot of stuff going on in

1896
06:27:54,930 --> 06:28:01,680
earthbound it's not really the same genre even bookworm adventures deluxe

1897
06:28:01,680 --> 06:28:08,810
how many there's a lot I haven't heard that in a long time maybe I'll do that

2088
06:54:41,040 --> 06:54:46,560
2020 is get crumpled up into an annoying bulky thing in your pocket that you then

2089
06:54:46,560 --> 06:54:50,599
have to avoid when you're trying to get other shit out of your pocket that you

2095
06:55:50,939 --> 06:55:59,819
exonerated no you can just deep-fake that and just print out your own fake

2096
06:55:59,860 --> 06:56:02,740
receipt no that doesn't work anymore nothing works anymore nothing is real

2097
06:56:02,740 --> 06:56:06,860

2110
06:57:47,229 --> 06:57:51,349
because his personality itself is dated Mario is basically a blank slate

2111
06:57:51,349 --> 06:57:55,750
character while Sonic has all the baggage of the mid to late 90s holy shit

2112

06:58:51,840 --> 06:58:59,259
hey Keith King Crimson thanks for the 250 the ultimate evolution of Sonic

2119
06:58:59,259 --> 06:59:02,580
going faster is making an idle clicker game where you keep increasing Sonic's

Sonic have it be a different character speedo quick tweet it so it's yours

2122
06:59:17,169 --> 06:59:24,919
don't let anybody take that you wrote it here first I got it I have I have

2123
06:59:24,919 --> 06:59:32,400
documentation that you said that writer Keith King Crimson at 1943 p.m. on October

2124
06:59:32,400 --> 06:59:41,729
3rd 2019 said those words done it's now it's here forever not a bad idea though

2125
06:59:41,729 --> 06:59:45,169
hey gnarly thanks for the 250 I think this stream has solidified the fact that

2126
06:59:45,169 --> 06:59:51,319
I have the worst taste in German streams what I really like the Clocktower 3

2127
06:59:51,319 --> 06:59:56,830
Hearthstone and now the NGU stream good lord that doesn't mean you can take my

2128
06:59:56,830 --> 07:00:03,680
recommendations any less seriously Clocktower 3 was one of the top five

2129
07:00:03,680 --> 07:00:13,810
streams I've ever done what do you mean bad taste that was like one of my

2130
07:00:13,810 --> 07:00:24,689
favorite streams ever like top 10 really top 15 when did I do Clocktower 3 that

2131
07:00:24,689 --> 07:00:29,880
was a while ago was it like that was in Vegas though right that was post Vegas

2132
07:00:29,880 --> 07:00:36,439
move six months ago seven months ago something like that earlier earlier this

2133
07:00:36,439 --> 07:00:44,069
last year something like that you don't have bad taste we time Hearthstone all

2134
07:00:44,069 --> 07:00:49,099
right I'm gonna have to disagree with you because I think that streams bad hey

2135
07:00:49,099 --> 07:00:54,740
doesn't matter how bad that stream was I opened 50 packs automatic good content

2136
07:00:54,740 --> 07:01:16,759
I had to go during the clicker RPG thing what happened I slayed some demons the

2137
07:01:16,759 --> 07:01:23,250
numbers went up they did yeah thank you bone jackal for the 500 bits germ I've

2138
07:01:23,250 --> 07:01:26,130
been stuck in this car going past your house for hours trying to get your

2139
07:01:26,130 --> 07:01:30,930
attention if I slow down below 70 miles per hour you're doing a speed joke okay

2140
07:01:30,930 --> 07:01:45,040
please get out of here help me this is a speed thing all right well what's my

2141
07:01:45,040 --> 07:01:49,360
favorite stream all of them except for Mario tennis that's actually the stream

2142
07:01:49,360 --> 07:01:52,919
that I don't I like the least like if I could delete a stream from everybody's

2143
07:01:52,919 --> 07:01:55,880
memory would be that one if I had like a genie that came up with three wishes one

2144
07:01:55,880 --> 07:02:06,619
of them would be to delete the Mario tennis stream like I never happened not

2145
07:02:06,619 --> 07:02:09,299
even the bird the birdhouse stream was fucking awesome we talking about that

2146
07:02:09,299 --> 07:02:14,139
was that was great I made a birdhouse on stream you I still own it I still have

2147
07:02:14,139 --> 07:02:24,759
it it's out there birds are in it 23 hours from now you know I should do like

2148
07:02:24,759 --> 07:02:45,080
a German lie emote but it's German 23 HR German 23 HRS interesting but thank you

2149
07:02:45,080 --> 07:02:49,279
bone jackal hopefully you figure it out hey white Fox thanks for the thousand

2150
07:02:49,279 --> 07:02:53,860
bits hey man because you're basically my therapist here we go I started a PhD in

2151
07:02:53,860 --> 07:02:58,619
genetics this month holy shit but it's four hours from my fiance and we miss

2152
07:02:58,619 --> 07:03:03,419
each other long-distance wedding planning is ass considering just

2153
07:03:03,419 --> 07:03:07,500
dropping the program and moving to be closer to her have some connections with

2154
07:03:07,500 --> 07:03:12,959
entomology closer to her but it pays less what's your advice also more

2155
07:03:12,959 --> 07:03:20,720
importantly it hits her ass I'd read that okay I'm a whole I'm a whole picture

2156
07:03:20,720 --> 07:03:24,159
kind of guy there you go it's your answer that one why did I answer it I

2157
07:03:24,159 --> 07:03:31,439
don't know but to answer the other question you need to do what you fuck

2158
07:03:31,439 --> 07:03:44,119
you need to do what you think you need to do what you think is best if you

2159
07:03:44,119 --> 07:03:49,610
think that making more money is more important to you then do it if you think

2160
07:03:49,610 --> 07:03:53,959
that being closer to somebody that you really care about is more important to

2161
07:03:53,959 --> 07:03:59,060
do it you are right now you are getting telltale to right now unfortunately it

2162
07:03:59,060 --> 07:04:04,509
happens at least a few times in everybody's life you get telltale

2163
07:04:15,869 --> 07:04:21,590
no no you have like a choice that affects your life that is really one or

2164
07:04:21,590 --> 07:04:29,880
the other it depends how much less money right it is if are you talking like a

2165
07:04:29,880 --> 07:04:34,799
million versus like 50 grand you know I'm saying is it like ridiculously less

2166
07:04:34,799 --> 07:04:48,799
then that weighs a little more right weddings are really pricey they are I

2167
07:04:48,799 --> 07:05:00,139
would say if it's as large monetary gain yes but you also want to stay happy you

2168
07:05:00,180 --> 07:05:06,380
want to keep yourself happy if work is not going to make you happy then do the

2169
07:05:06,380 --> 07:05:10,270
thing that's going to make you happy if being closer to somebody that you really

2170
07:05:10,270 --> 07:05:13,909
care about is going to make you feel better and your job that you could do

2171
07:05:13,909 --> 07:05:19,610
there better I would say do that because you don't want to run into a scenario

2172
07:05:19,610 --> 07:05:24,819
where you're very far away and you're making a little bit more money but you

2173
07:05:24,819 --> 07:05:30,840
wish you weren't doing that you need to be completely comfortable with that

2174
07:05:30,840 --> 07:05:42,159
decision and I think the comfortable decision is the second one but it also

2175
07:05:42,159 --> 07:05:48,389
depends as a lot of factors here it appeared how much do you want that PhD

2176
07:05:48,389 --> 07:05:59,209
how long is it gonna take if you can put up with doing that for a little while to

2177
07:05:59,209 --> 07:06:07,419
get your PhD and do that then it might be worth it you know I'm saying why are

2178
07:06:07,419 --> 07:06:15,959
you asking this motherfucker for advice

2179
07:06:16,479 --> 07:06:31,240
easy I'm trying to help no but for real it's given advice like this is tough

2180
07:06:31,240 --> 07:06:36,209
because I don't know where your priorities lie everybody has different

2181
07:06:36,209 --> 07:06:40,659
priorities everybody has a pre shit prep everybody's a post shit prep some

2182
07:06:40,659 --> 07:06:50,709
people stretch that's what I've heard but your plan has to be what you want not

2183
07:06:50,709 --> 07:06:55,509
what I would want because I don't know if what I want is what you would want to

2184
07:06:57,630 --> 07:07:06,439
to me it sounds like you are putting a lot of weight on being closer to the

2185
07:07:06,439 --> 07:07:17,360
person that you love sometimes that on the scale tips way more and depending on

2186
07:07:17,360 --> 07:07:21,319
how loud like I said how long it takes for you to get that PhD it might be

2187
07:07:21,319 --> 07:07:27,090
worth doing it and then moving depends on how badly you want I'm avoiding the

2188
07:07:27,090 --> 07:07:29,990
question I just I just said I just said the second one's probably a better idea

2189
07:07:29,990 --> 07:07:36,720
I just said it I just did it I just said it I just said it I just said that okay

2190
07:07:37,279 --> 07:07:48,840
I already said it he asked for advice not a self-help novel well I would how

2191
07:07:48,840 --> 07:07:56,150
do you give advice but advice that is advice I am given advice that that's

2192
07:07:56,150 --> 07:08:02,919
what I'm doing white Fox don't listen to these

2193
07:08:02,919 --> 07:08:14,619
jokers in here but I the most important question there was you know I answered

2194
07:08:14,619 --> 07:08:24,439
it for you jokers you're doing your best but all jokes

2195
07:08:24,439 --> 07:08:27,759
decided it's hard to give advice when I don't know the kind of gravity of the

2196
07:08:27,759 --> 07:08:35,119
situation I don't know what you really want it's gonna take a lot of thinking

2197
07:08:35,119 --> 07:08:42,490
but hopefully you figure it out I really do wish you the best but if you're good

2198
07:08:42,490 --> 07:08:48,580
at something never do it for free that's exactly yes hey Aqua Reaper thanks for

2199
07:08:48,580 --> 07:08:53,560

2201
07:08:57,000 --> 07:09:07,569
strange when you finally catch a shiny Pokemon Jerma how do you feel that I live

07:09:07,569 --> 07:09:11,049
in your house and always remain out of sight waiting to strangle you to death

07:10:58,509 --> 07:11:08,069

07:11:19,979 --> 07:11:27,060
proudest work I still do have proud work too that's not that but that was the

2217
07:11:27,060 --> 07:11:34,580
culmination of my entire life on YouTube so that requires so much

2218
07:11:34,580 --> 07:11:41,659
knowledge that's why you started one you started one Castle Griffiths did it as
