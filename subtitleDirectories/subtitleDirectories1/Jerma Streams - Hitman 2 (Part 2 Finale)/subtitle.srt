1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:11,669
Hey, how's it going? Turn up the volume. I have this at a reasonable decibel level, I believe.

2
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:21,859
How you guys doing? Just making a tweet. Sorry, I didn't start where I wanted to about 30-40

3
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:30,390
minutes ago. One of my webcams was blue-screening the computer. I have no idea why. I have two

4
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:38,420
webcams. Remember when I had the Labo stream from this past weekend? I mean, they were

5
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,700
all the things I read about saying that when you open up OBS and you have two webcams

6
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,179
enabled, it blue-screens, but I wasn't having that problem before. I don't know if there was

7
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:53,670
like a stealth update to the Logitech software. I have no idea, but apparently one of these was

8
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,070
just causing the driver to crash and blue-screening the whole computer. But hey,

9
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:04,040
I think I fixed it. We're good. Hasn't happened yet, so that's good. So let's see.

10
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,780
Seeing the sites in Hitman 2. Yeah, because that means I haven't seen it before.

11
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,129
It could be anything, you know, it could be whatever. Seeing the sites in Hitman 2.

12
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:27,109
That sounds pretty good to me. All right, so yeah, we got to the halfway point last night,

13
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:36,840
and I would assume, judging by we did three areas last night, I'm going to assume that we've

14
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,540
got three more here that will take us to the end. Now, that does not mean this is the end of

15
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:49,060
Hitman streams. This is talking about end of the campaign, technically, because there's a whole

16
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:54,819
lot of shit to do. And by the end of this stream, we will gauge whether or not I do it again.

17
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:00,659
And I will go back, we'll play some other contracts, we'll do some other campaign missions.

18
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,819
But for the purpose of the story, we're going to be done, I think, today.

19
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:12,060
So put some clothes on. I have clothes. Listen. No, I got to turn this off so you can hear

20
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:27,620
it. Ready? See? And then I got clothes on. Whoa, that was wicked loud! Why was it so loud?

21
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:34,069
And the canon vocal cords, just what was that? It was like, so here we are. Where

22
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:45,580
were we last time? I don't know why that was so loud. So we got Hitman 2. I don't know what

23
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:52,439
this is. So mission night call, we did it. Blank check. Cinematic. Let's go through our

24
00:02:52,439 --> 00:03:00,419
Microsoft Windows tiles. Chasing a ghost and a ghost. And here we go. Mission Another Life.

25
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:07,210
This is where we left off. It's like, this is like spoilers. Why is it showing this to me?

26
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:15,750
Another life. But we're not gonna do it yet. And I know that the I know the audio is not on.

27
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:26,169
I'm well aware of it. Stop looking. But let's let people trickle in while I talk about

28
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:33,770
one other important thing. The green screen stream is slated and scheduled for tomorrow.

29
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:40,840
The thing is, though, I don't have a time yet. Because it's I'm kind of I'm working with a

30
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:47,659
studio. So I need to get like a time from them. I think it might just be kind of whenever

31
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:57,449
whenever I can start. So I don't necessarily have a direct exact time. But I will make

32
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:02,090
sure to tweet either later tonight or tomorrow afternoon the time that it's going to happen.

33
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,340
An estimate I would probably say around the normal start time what it's been for the last

34
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:13,180
couple of weeks. That's at least when I would like to do it. So it might be a little earlier

35
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,779
than that, considering I might I want to get in there early and get everything set up. So

36
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:24,870
the rough estimate is probably going to be between like four, like three and six

37
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:32,810
eastern time p.m. Maybe pull back a little bit earlier than that between like two and five maybe

38
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:38,040
eastern. I don't I just don't know. I don't have that time from the studio yet. So

39
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,040
I know that I am there for what's a call day. You can either do half days or full days in a

40
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:52,810
studio. And I believe I'm on a half day. So I think that means probably from like nine in

41
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:59,019
the morning to ten in the morning to like four in the afternoon Pacific. So I don't know.

42
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:05,589
I don't know. But let's go. I just want to give an update on that because

43
00:05:05,589 --> 00:05:09,430
and if something if something crazy happens or if it changes I'll make sure to let you guys

44
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:15,269
know on Twitter. You know what? Just follow me on Twitter. Twitter.tv slash. I thought the

45
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:21,189
computer broke. The first constant is none other than Janus, the legendary Cold War spy

46
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:28,470
master, a KGB senior officer and head of the Sixth Column Special Branch at Lubyanka. Janus

47
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:35,189
is a certified genius and expert of counterintelligence. He retired from the KGB in 1988

48
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:39,750
when he fell out of favor with the Kremlin and affected to the U.S. Shortly after,

49
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:46,149
the Soviet Union collapsed. Now it is unclear when Janus stepped down as the constant. But

50
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:49,509
what's going on? Why is my computer like fucking up?

51
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:56,949
Right. So here's the catch. As an elite KGB agent, Janus was trained to withstand

52
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:01,750
interrogation and torture. No amount of pressure will force him to disclose information

53
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:08,310
he doesn't want to. Instead, we will need to search his home for clues. But if Providence

54
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:14,550
learns of our presence, the game is up. So we frame Janus, make Providence think

55
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,750
he was the real Shadow Client. Nice computer. Those is not Comcast. This is ComputerCast.

56
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:25,110
Claiming to have traced a number of calls from Janus's house to the Institute in Romania.

57
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:30,230
The case will seem clear. Mr. Gray was only a figurehead. Janus was pulling the strings

58
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:36,069
all along. And by eliminating him, we will have neutralized the militia once and for all.

59
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:43,029
However, for this subterfuge to work, you'll also need to deal with Janus's security detail.

60
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:49,029
Providence herald and former Secret Service agent by the name of Nolan Cassidy. Intel

61
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:54,949
describes him as diligent and inquisitive, and we cannot risk that he contradicts our story

62
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:03,189
Seems workable. I certainly hope so. Everything depends on this next move, 47. You made this

63
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:08,310
our fight. Now let's even the pain field. So they did a similar mission like this in

64
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:19,430
Hitman 2. What is going on with my frame rate? I am, I don't know. It's only like in that cut

65
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:26,410
scene. Is it Hitman 2 or is it Blood Money? Where you kind of have to go into the guy's

66
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:36,500
house. So I gotta get rid of these two. Let's take a look at our planning stage here. We

67
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:53,290
got Whittleton Creek. Oh, I got the silver baller this time. Master card. Mastercrafted.

68
00:07:55,449 --> 00:08:08,310
Well, I mean, I just unlocked it, so I have to use it, right? Suburban suit. I mean, I, I guess

69
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:22,120
you're just wearing a suit. Should I need, why can I, I should be like a jogger. What is ice?

70
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:28,920
Oh, that's icy. Okay. Uh, I could do remotes, fragments, sub sedative, fills, coins.

71
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:34,519
No, give me the lockpick. I'll take the fish, but I'm taking the lockpick. I'm not doing

72
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:40,700
like the duck again. It didn't serve any purpose besides just throwing it into fucking random

73
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:49,700
objectives. All right, looks good. So got to get rid of Janice and get rid of Mr. Cassidy.

74
00:08:50,259 --> 00:09:00,330
And now you got to find clues. I'm ready. Oh, so somebody, somebody, somebody who chatted,

75
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,529
but wait, Jeremy, what are you drinking tonight? What's that? Oh, I've both chatted

76
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:08,570
about random chatter. I'll tell you. So that it's a, um, I ran out of bananas

77
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:14,169
and I ran out of, of the things that I would put in here. Besides it's a, it's a, it's just

78
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:18,730
peanut butter and almond milk blended up hard. I'm just drinking peanut butter right now. It's

79
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:23,929
enough to like, it's a sustainable creek. Just like sustains me on the surface. A picture

80
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:31,289
perfect suburban dream, wide roads, golden maple trees and verdant lawns. Most residents

81
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:37,049
here are white collar professionals ranging from university staff to government employees.

82
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:44,649
So it runs fine now, but not all Janice's unpresuming home is protected by a host of

83
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:50,889
bodyguards and Intel shows that the fragile former constant rarely leaves the property.

84
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:56,870
Nolan Cassidy on the other hand, roams the neighborhood streets and he buys weed off the

85
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:02,629
local, the dutiful Providence paper route kids making threat assessments and settling in with

86
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:10,840
a security team. Now remember, this is about more than just revenge. Janice is the key to bring

87
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:18,840
down Providence. So get in there and find us a lead. Okay. Good luck. 47. So this just,

88
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,799
this is not just one house. This is just the whole neighborhood.

89
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:37,669
Okay. Let's see. You know, speaking of sustainability. Oh, this is not good. 47.

90
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:41,909
I've marked your map with several points of interest. We're running this mission with very

91
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:45,110
little upfront Intel. Alright, so I gotta be careful here. These locations could provide

92
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:51,830
clues to help you obtain the information we need. Good luck. Thanks. Alright, so let's see

93
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:58,549
what we got here. No entry. Don't tell me what to do. Oh, this is a yard sale. That's one

94
00:10:58,549 --> 00:11:04,179
of those novelty signs you put in your college dorm room in front of the door. That's

95
00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:15,620
cool. Uh, no, it's here. Wouldn't these things blow over? Yeah, they are blowing the leaves.

96
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,980
There he is. That is Nolan Cassidy, former Secret Service agent and current Providence

97
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,299
herald. Cassidy is assigned to protect Janice. Yeah. Well, he's not doing a very good job.

98
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:35,480
He's going to the college guy yard sale. Blend in as a garbage man. Where are they going?

99
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:56,519
Deal recording things from up there and then store in the tape somewhere else. I totally agree,

100
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,759
sir. Though separating the tapes from the playback device is necessary in case someone

101
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:05,799
gains access to the building. As you mentioned yourself, we can't let anyone know this is like

102
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:13,450
a bait. They're talking. I know what I said. Of course, I'm sorry. I'm just annoyed with

103
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:25,580
this setup. Understood, sir. Alright, interesting. So they're recording and the

104
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:29,860
tapes, the recording devices and the tapes are at different locations. Let me just keep looking

105
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:43,139
around. It's like a birthday party back here. Burlington Morgans. Are you allowed to go in

106
00:12:43,139 --> 00:13:23,059
people's houses? Where's the mission? Am I allowed to be in here? I just opened up

107
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:35,370
somebody's house. I haven't seen you before. Who are you? Nobody. Is he like your boyfriend

108
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:41,909
or something? Oh, that's a party.

109
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:53,379
That's a party. Is this like your boyfriend or something?

110
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:09,940
He's not going to drink that, is he? Wait, you're not going to drink that, are you?

111
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,830
Oh, shit.

112
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:37,610
What? Back in the day, Janus was known for his obsessive need to archive

113
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:42,250
and keep memorabilia. If he has any microfilm in his house, it might contain something

114
00:14:42,250 --> 00:15:00,149
interesting. Oh shit. Oh no, I can't. I can't do it. I can't. I'm not going to do it.

115
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:10,950
I can't. I can't do that. Oh, god damn it. All right.

116
00:15:34,789 --> 00:15:47,000
All right, I'm ready. I was going to eat dinner. I'm sorry. I didn't want to do that.

117
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,639
We're running this mission with very little up front intel.

118
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:54,279
I just ran a simulation. I have to see every possibility. You know what I mean?

119
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,759
What's that movie where the guy could see every possibility? Dr. Strange. I need to see every

120
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,720
possibility to find out which one is the right one. You know what I mean? My head's going

121
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,159
all over the place. Look at my face. I'm making different facial expressions and shit.

122
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,539
I needed to see what was possible.

123
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:13,580
...to help you obtain the information we need. Good luck.

124
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:23,299
Let's go over there. Yeah, that was not the correct timeline. But I saw the timeline. In

125
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:26,100
fact, we're going to go to the party because I feel like that's interesting to look at.

126
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:35,399
I did the Dr. Strange instead. No, see, right now I'm currently sitting on the rock.

127
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,039
I'm sitting there as Dr. Strange. This is how long it took him, guys.

128
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:45,830
Like he had to see it all. He had to see every possibility and he just lived it.

129
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,750
That's what I'm doing right now until I find the right one.

130
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:58,710
That's not a spoiler. Dr. Strange like sits on a rock is not a spoiler.

131
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,190
Where does he sit?

132
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,500
Microfilm viewer.

133
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:28,740
That's an interesting...

134
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,339
Is this her party?

135
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:34,420
Well, it's sort of a hobby that never really took off. Besides,

136
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,430
I don't have any microfilm to play on the viewer.

137
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,029
Oh, I will. Very soon.

138
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,960
Janus next door collects all kinds of ancient memorabilia.

139
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,059
He might tape or where it is that sort of thing uses.

140
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:52,980
I'm sure he'd be delighted to lend you some.

141
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,619
The rock is in the New Avengers movie. Sure.

142
00:17:55,619 --> 00:17:59,940
Janus was known for his obsessive need to archive and keep memorabilia.

143
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,779
If he has any microfilm in his house, it might contain something interesting.

144
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:08,390
Okay, so locate the microfilm is the next part.

145
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,910
Let's see. If Janus has any microfilm in his house,

146
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,670
it's bound to contain something interesting.

147
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,190
I'm assuming that's probably one of these.

148
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:22,230
An apple a day, breadcrumb trail, charbroiled, a house for sale,

149
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,869
no-spoking, pest control, and whack-a-mole.

150
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:30,950
It's not yet. Not yet.

151
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:36,740
Let's save it right here in case I drown somebody.

152
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:46,309
Sabotage. No, I need a screwdriver.

153
00:18:54,069 --> 00:18:55,589
Just pretend to be the waiter.

154
00:18:55,589 --> 00:18:56,309
Excuse me, sir.

155
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:01,109
Sir, would you like some cracked pepper?

156
00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:02,950
Let me do that for you.

157
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:09,579
Smells like a gerbil crawled up your ass and died.

158
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,450
Kill that guy. That was just... come on, man.

159
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:30,519
No offense.

160
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:45,099
Hold on, wait a second. Can I push him into the grill?

161
00:19:51,619 --> 00:19:54,019
I can't. I can't push him into the grill.

162
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:59,369
That's so unfortunate.

163
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:04,099
Oh, it's the propane tank not even on.

164
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,519
I need a propane tank.

165
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:13,460
Now let's keep looking around back here.

166
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:15,140
This is like a little party.

167
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,450
Fire extinguisher.

168
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,450
All right, let me install that for you.

169
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,579
Oh, this thing uses gas.

170
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:41,859
I can't pick this log.

171
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:42,579
I'm just gonna go around.

172
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:46,920
Somebody's right there.

173
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,720
All right, does this open?

174
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:51,319
Far less eyeballs over here.

175
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:52,920
I think I could get it.

176
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,559
Let's try it.

177
00:20:54,279 --> 00:21:02,410
Okay, this is the Griswold property.

178
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:17,049
What?

179
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:21,150
No reason for him to kick the habit when he's already so close to kicking the...

180
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:25,230
So, Janeless Smudge, despite being dependent on an oxygen tank

181
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,029
and his bodyguard's insistence on hiding his cigarettes.

182
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,869
I wonder what might happen if he combined the two.

183
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,609
Obtain a pack of cigarettes.

184
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:40,250
Have you seen that oxygen tank near his bedroom window?

185
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,329
Near his bedroom window.

186
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:44,579
Okay.

187
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,460
So, uh...

188
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,819
I'm currently trespassing though, so I gotta get out of here.

189
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,980
Make him smoke waaaaah.

190
00:21:57,579 --> 00:21:58,079
Kitty pull.

191
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:09,740
Can they see me?

192
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:11,779
Oh, they can.

193
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:12,339
All right, I'm gone.

194
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:12,839
I'm leaving.

195
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,740
I'm going, I'm going, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out.

196
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:21,069
This is a restricted area.

197
00:22:21,069 --> 00:22:22,109
And you guys have guns?

198
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:26,720
I'm being shot at.

199
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,519
I just wanted to get my son's ball.

200
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:31,200
He threw it over the fence accidentally.

201
00:22:45,569 --> 00:22:47,170
They're shooting at you with nail guns.

202
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:49,839
All right, I need to go.

203
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:52,319
Let's, let's, let's track the cigarette one.

204
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:57,069
Might as well.

205
00:22:57,069 --> 00:22:57,789
We'll give it a try.

206
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,910
So, pack of cigarettes.

207
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:01,789
I gotta get over here.

208
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:08,299
I should be able to pop this lock without anyone shooting me.

209
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:10,799
I think, right?

210
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,759
They didn't see it last time, so why would they see it this time?

211
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:26,640
Okay, pack of story.

212
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,440
Pack of cigarettes.

213
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,160
There they are.

214
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,099
All right.

215
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:35,099
Infiltrate the Janus property now.

216
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,119
Which is right there.

217
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,750
He's using the waypoint.

218
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,940
So, I mean, I, whatever.

219
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,700
I just, I, why should I not be doing that?

220
00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:58,769
I mean, I, I just like found it.

221
00:23:58,769 --> 00:24:00,210
I didn't activate it at first.

222
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:08,130
I'm cheating.

223
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:08,630
Cheater.

224
00:24:09,329 --> 00:24:10,990
Is this considered cheating?

225
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:18,420
I gotta get in through there.

226
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,940
But this place is heavily protected.

227
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:35,519
You get, you get a game refine.

228
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,970
Oh, how do I get through there?

229
00:24:40,769 --> 00:24:42,769
Go get that man some gas.

230
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:45,910
What?

231
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:47,730
Place food.

232
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,289
What food?

233
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:53,750
What?

234
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:56,609
No, I, I just made it smaller.

235
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,019
I just made sushi in front of these people.

236
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,960
Gas, gas, gas.

237
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,680
Well, I need.

238
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,099
I just lost my fish.

239
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:13,299
I just turned it into sushi.

240
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:14,980
Why not just go inside?

241
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,259
It's open to everyone.

242
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:16,980
I know, I know the main story.

243
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:17,480
I know it.

244
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,619
Mission story revealed.

245
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:20,339
No, I don't.

246
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:20,839
I know.

247
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:22,500
I know.

248
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,339
It sounds like Nolan Cassidy has some interest in the party as well.

249
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:28,900
But for some reason, he's unwilling to go inside.

250
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:32,579
Maybe you can help fix whatever's wrong in there, 47.

251
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,970
Well, maybe he's a vegan.

252
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:39,500
I don't trust a man who can't eat a rare steak.

253
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,259
I don't trust a man who can't eat a rare steak.

254
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:44,960
Yeah.

255
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:46,940
Call it.

256
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,420
I want E.

257
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:47,920
Coli.

258
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:54,140
What the fuck did you say?

259
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:54,779
Don't let it slide.

260
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:55,339
Let it slide.

261
00:25:55,339 --> 00:25:55,900
Let it slide.

262
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,460
Let it slide.

263
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,220
Let it slide.

264
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,119
All right.

265
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:15,119
The propane tank was just like over here.

266
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,460
I already opened this.

267
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,420
Where's the propane tank?

268
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:22,859
Probably by the grill, right?

269
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:24,799
Cheater.

270
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:37,329
Hey, it's in the game.

271
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,130
I'm going to utilize the waypoints if they show themselves.

272
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:42,930
Otherwise, look, I'm going to level with you guys here.

273
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:43,730
Like level with me.

274
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,750
You've seen the way that I've played the game so far.

275
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:49,869
If there was not a blip on the map somewhere,

276
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:54,430
eventually, I'm eventually telling me where I need to be,

277
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,880
I would just drown people in toilets.

278
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:58,000
You know what I mean?

279
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,119
I would just throw gas canisters over here.

280
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,859
I would just fucking punch people.

281
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:05,420
That would happen, and it just would.

282
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,569
I would get lost somewhere,

283
00:27:07,569 --> 00:27:10,369
and I would just start karate chopping people.

284
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,369
And I do that anyways.

285
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:23,059
Understandable.

286
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:23,700
Have a nice day.

287
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:27,779
Propane tank.

288
00:27:38,829 --> 00:27:39,150
All right.

289
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,109
So let's save us here.

290
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:43,380
Let me help you with that.

291
00:27:54,099 --> 00:27:57,059
Another boyfriend?

292
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:58,660
Another boyfriend?

293
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:58,980
What?

294
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:16,029
Is he your boyfriend?

295
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:16,750
What is that?

296
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,470
The go-to.

297
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,690
Who else is going to explode?

298
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:33,549
I love that so much.

299
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,940
Who is this guy?

300
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:38,019
Is he your boyfriend?

301
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,349
The canned dialogue.

302
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:43,869
I turned off the stove.

303
00:28:43,869 --> 00:28:44,349
Shoot him.

304
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:46,589
If you could take a couple of steps back,

305
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:49,460
make me a little more comfortable.

306
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,019
Investigate distraction?

307
00:29:02,269 --> 00:29:04,670
Why would that be a distraction from that far away?

308
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,359
Somebody turned on the gas over here.

309
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,119
I know I'm going to make a joke that's been made a thousand fucking times before,

310
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:24,240
but honest to God, that's like the

311
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,279
don't touch the thermostat family guy joke.

312
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,160
And I'm not going to make it,

313
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,319
but I'm just saying like he heard the thermostat from like that far away.

314
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:37,119
I didn't make it.

315
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:37,920
I didn't make the joke.

316
00:29:40,609 --> 00:29:41,569
I didn't say anything.

317
00:29:41,569 --> 00:29:42,210
Wait, he's leaving.

318
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:54,859
Go get rat poison.

319
00:29:55,420 --> 00:30:00,420
Well, that would make sense now, wouldn't it?

320
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,859
Pick up meaty bone.

321
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,400
Can I eat?

322
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,720
I can't eat the meaty bone.

323
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,390
Oh shit.

324
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,349
I got to hide this guy.

325
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,519
Where can I put him?

326
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:25,630
That wouldn't be a good idea.

327
00:30:30,769 --> 00:30:31,730
Can I stuff him in the cupboard?

328
00:30:32,369 --> 00:30:37,710
There's got to be a closet right here.

329
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,519
Put him on the stove.

330
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,140
All right.

331
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,900
So I got to get rat poison now.

332
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,240
Is this cooked or is this raw?

333
00:31:17,539 --> 00:31:18,500
I just turned it off.

334
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:20,660
What are they searching for?

335
00:31:53,069 --> 00:31:54,190
Does she not know how to turn it on?

336
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,269
She doesn't know how to work the TV.

337
00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:12,609
How does it keep turning off?

338
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:29,059
Idiot.

339
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,220
Didn't I have poison?

340
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:36,640
I poisoned this cup.

341
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,039
Thank you.

342
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,839
Rat poison.

343
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:46,799
It's probably some like let's suspiciously go out the window.

344
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,339
I put the bone over here.

345
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,059
Poison TV power button.

346
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:18,450
Why am I trying to jump out the windows?

347
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:20,829
I'm now the server.

348
00:33:23,339 --> 00:33:25,259
Poison the whole barbecue.

349
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:26,299
I'm not going to do that.

350
00:33:26,859 --> 00:33:27,660
Is that what I'm going to do?

351
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:29,579
That's not what I'm about to do, right?

352
00:33:42,579 --> 00:33:43,539
Start serving people.

353
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,539
Serve food.

354
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,220
Now we don't want to add this.

355
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:01,099
Some seasoning.

356
00:34:02,369 --> 00:34:03,970
That was just a little bit of garlic salt.

357
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:04,609
Celery salt.

358
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:05,730
There.

359
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:06,289
Go ahead sir.

360
00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:07,809
Care for a taste.

361
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,269
Special seasoning.

362
00:34:14,269 --> 00:34:14,989
Yes.

363
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:16,190
Glad to be of service.

364
00:34:19,539 --> 00:34:20,179
How does it taste?

365
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:24,780
Maybe why don't you come over here and add some seasoning.

366
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,300
Hold on.

367
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,659
Are they going to fill up the bathrooms?

368
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,269
They're all going to go into the bathrooms?

369
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:42,829
Oh no way.

370
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:46,260
Where is he going?

371
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:49,460
Oh thanks.

372
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:53,969
You're welcome.

373
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:55,090
He's going in that bathroom.

374
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,489
Are they all going to try to go into the same bathroom?

375
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:01,469
I kind of need to find out, right?

376
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,389
They're all going to go to the same bathroom.

377
00:35:26,849 --> 00:35:27,570
Here's this guy.

378
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,679
Where's the other guy?

379
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:41,809
Didn't this guy just eat it?

380
00:35:41,809 --> 00:35:42,610
How is he fine?

381
00:35:55,389 --> 00:35:57,309
I need to, you need to keep poisoning it.

382
00:35:59,789 --> 00:36:00,510
Oh, I don't.

383
00:36:01,309 --> 00:36:03,789
Only the one guy got poisoned.

384
00:36:05,409 --> 00:36:06,210
You should try this.

385
00:36:13,699 --> 00:36:14,579
Well, oh well.

386
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:17,380
Obtain rat poison.

387
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,420
Can I go get more?

388
00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:22,139
Hold on a minute.

389
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:30,909
So you want me to, like I'm going to reload.

390
00:36:30,909 --> 00:36:32,269
I'm going to poison it every time.

391
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:36,699
So I have one rat poison.

392
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,699
I need to find another rat poison.

393
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,400
Use laxatives.

394
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,800
I don't have, now I'm going to have to go on like a search for those.

395
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,380
Well, whatever.

396
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:00,559
I'll just wait for him to come in.

397
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:02,639
Alright folks, the food is ready.

398
00:37:03,809 --> 00:37:05,010
Poison the one that you should.

399
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:07,090
Yeah, I know, but I told you.

400
00:37:07,969 --> 00:37:10,260
There's something weird to do.

401
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:10,900
I want to try it.

402
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:12,980
Excuse me.

403
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:14,420
Care for a snack.

404
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:19,860
I didn't poison it, right?

405
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:21,300
Sure thing.

406
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:28,639
Hello.

407
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:30,239
I tempt you with a little snack.

408
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:31,119
Flip the table.

409
00:37:35,179 --> 00:37:40,289
Why are they playing this music in this current time period?

410
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:45,010
This does feel like a 50s party, doesn't it?

411
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:46,449
You want to try something?

412
00:37:46,449 --> 00:37:47,170
Alright, here he comes.

413
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:50,449
Let's hope he likes his food, 47.

414
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:51,969
Thanks so much.

415
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:53,250
Sure.

416
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:53,969
Well, here he comes.

417
00:38:00,449 --> 00:38:02,940
What?

418
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:24,300
So, was I supposed to poison that guy?

419
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:26,380
Or this dude?

420
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:28,940
Oh, here we go.

421
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:29,659
This dude right here.

422
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:30,619
Can I call you Rich?

423
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:33,179
Need something?

424
00:38:35,659 --> 00:38:35,980
Hey.

425
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,780
This is what I like to eat.

426
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,940
Care to try something special?

427
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,159
Thanks so much.

428
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:52,159
Yeah, make sure to pick the one with extra seasoning.

429
00:38:52,880 --> 00:39:00,639
What's going on?

430
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:02,400
Why don't you give this a try?

431
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,380
No way.

432
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,050
Excuse me.

433
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,570
You should try this.

434
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,010
It really is to die for.

435
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,280
Who wants a taste?

436
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,420
You?

437
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,519
Go ahead.

438
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:18,019
No way.

439
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:20,119
You sure?

440
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,010
You sure?

441
00:39:23,949 --> 00:39:24,449
Excuse me.

442
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:26,710
Hey.

443
00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:27,440
You okay?

444
00:39:32,619 --> 00:39:38,480
Keep it in and you can do it.

445
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,360
Now shoot him.

446
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:39,860
No.

447
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,869
How long do I plan on serving food?

448
00:39:45,869 --> 00:39:47,550
Uh, maybe another 20 minutes or so.

449
00:39:48,349 --> 00:39:51,070
I'm gonna be in this bathroom, right?

450
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:51,570
Okay.

451
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:57,510
Look, I'm not only in my server, but I'm also a bathroom attendant.

452
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:03,960
What did he just drop?

453
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,760
He just dropped a bunch of-

454
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:07,179
Okay.

455
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,820
Should have drowned him.

456
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,900
He threw up all the newspapers.

457
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:29,780
Well, I have him now.

458
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,280
All right.

459
00:40:30,739 --> 00:40:31,239
I'm ready.

460
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:33,510
Now I am the mailman.

461
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:47,139
So now I can deliver the mail.

462
00:40:48,099 --> 00:40:48,599
Hi there.

463
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:50,440
Get out of the way.

464
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,070
Go get some fries.

465
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:58,550
You know, I did hear that the fries are really good.

466
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,150
Maybe I should try one.

467
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:04,079
What if I serve as the mailman?

468
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:06,800
No, I can't.

469
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,079
I can't serve food as the mailman.

470
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,099
That is Nolan Cassidy.

471
00:41:18,659 --> 00:41:22,019
Former Secret Service agent in current Providence House.

472
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:24,500
Cassidy is assigned to protect James.

473
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,579
Well, now we're doing the mailman arc.

474
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:29,400
I'll just wait my turn.

475
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,780
He's here now.

476
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,780
It only took you like 10 minutes to get here.

477
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:42,130
I could have just poisoned him and drowned him.

478
00:42:06,449 --> 00:42:07,570
I gotta get him out of his loop.

479
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:09,030
What?

480
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:11,889
What is that?

481
00:42:11,889 --> 00:42:12,769
What is she doing that for?

482
00:42:13,409 --> 00:42:15,429
I don't understand.

483
00:42:15,429 --> 00:42:15,929
What's this for?

484
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:23,510
Why does she have a question mark?

485
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:24,949
I need poison.

486
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:26,929
Poison, quick.

487
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:29,090
If I was poisoned, I know where I'd be.

488
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,210
In somebody's house.

489
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:30,849
Somebody's garage.

490
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:33,880
He's still con-

491
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,199
He doesn't-

492
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:34,699
He's gone.

493
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,000
Is that even blood in her head?

494
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,000
That's a flower.

495
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,800
Yeah, he's leaving.

496
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:53,739
Okay.

497
00:42:53,739 --> 00:42:54,519
Time to be the mailman.

498
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:00,980
What?

499
00:43:03,699 --> 00:43:04,900
I am the mailman.

500
00:43:05,539 --> 00:43:06,980
What do you mean the opportunity passed?

501
00:43:07,539 --> 00:43:08,019
The guy-

502
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:09,300
I- I am the mailman.

503
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:30,519
Oh, Mr. Wilson!

504
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,480
Nolan Cassidy is down.

505
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,920
Good work for his-

506
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,639
Whoa, what?

507
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:46,130
That guy just was being dragged up by his feet.

508
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:48,760
All right.

509
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,480
So I'm gonna-

510
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,039
I have to wait.

511
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:54,789
I just have to wait.

512
00:43:54,789 --> 00:43:56,710
I just have to serve people and wait for him to get here.

513
00:44:03,889 --> 00:44:05,090
All right, folks.

514
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:06,210
The food is ready.

515
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,050
He's gonna take so long.

516
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:09,010
Oh, god damn it.

517
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:11,360
I gotta think of something-

518
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:12,800
I just relax.

519
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,280
I'll be fine.

520
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,079
Do you have me relax?

521
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,760
That was a Dennis the Menace joke in 2018.

522
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,750
That's true.

523
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,739
You really do have to serve for 20 minutes.

524
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,619
That person thought that I was making a-

525
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:27,300
A joke?

526
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:27,800
No?

527
00:44:28,179 --> 00:44:29,699
I actually have to wait till he gets over here.

528
00:44:29,699 --> 00:44:30,340
Whatever he's doing.

529
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:30,840
Yes, thanks.

530
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,739
No, thank you.

531
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:39,329
Mail guy.

532
00:44:39,329 --> 00:44:41,730
See, the problem there was-

533
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:42,690
I was supposed to-

534
00:44:45,489 --> 00:44:48,530
I was supposed to take out the mailman before he came to get food.

535
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,239
I did it in reverse.

536
00:44:54,039 --> 00:44:54,519
All right.

537
00:44:54,519 --> 00:44:56,199
Serve a guest to make room for Cassidy.

538
00:44:56,199 --> 00:44:57,159
But Cassidy's not here.

539
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,050
Should I just wait till he gets here?

540
00:45:02,389 --> 00:45:04,199
Wrap your lips around this.

541
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:06,440
Is he your boyfriend or something?

542
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:09,539
Let's hope he likes his food, 47.

543
00:45:09,539 --> 00:45:11,059
Okay, mission story completed.

544
00:45:11,059 --> 00:45:11,539
But I-

545
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:12,039
No, I didn't.

546
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:13,940
It's made just for you.

547
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:18,480
He's still not here.

548
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,900
I just have to sit here.

549
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,039
See, this is why-

550
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:31,480
Here comes the mailman again.

551
00:45:36,179 --> 00:45:37,780
The mailman is the real target.

552
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,559
See, he comes over and talks.

553
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:50,280
He's like, hey, Rich.

554
00:46:00,469 --> 00:46:01,030
Mail-

555
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:02,710
I'm not gonna poison the mailman again.

556
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:05,909
He's gonna make his way over here

557
00:46:05,909 --> 00:46:07,269
after whatever he's doing over there.

558
00:46:07,269 --> 00:46:08,150
And then I'm gonna-

559
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:09,030
I'm gonna take him out.

560
00:46:09,909 --> 00:46:14,019
Why does the chef have snowboard glasses on?

561
00:46:14,019 --> 00:46:16,550
That's a great question.

562
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,400
Excuse me.

563
00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:20,920
Care for a snack?

564
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:24,690
He rubbed his belly to indicate he was hungry.

565
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:28,579
My pleasure.

566
00:46:29,139 --> 00:46:34,789
Oh, wait, I forgot.

567
00:46:34,789 --> 00:46:35,829
I can't have fried food.

568
00:46:43,429 --> 00:46:44,309
You should try this.

569
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:48,659
Hello.

570
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:51,119
Can I tempt you with a little snack?

571
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:53,809
Here it comes.

572
00:46:53,809 --> 00:46:55,090
All right, get out of the way then.

573
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:56,530
He's like smiffing.

574
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:57,170
What is this like?

575
00:46:57,730 --> 00:46:58,369
Oh, gosh.

576
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:00,530
Get out of the way then.

577
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:03,030
Here it comes.

578
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:08,420
Wanna try something different?

579
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,900
All right, get the fuck out of here.

580
00:47:20,369 --> 00:47:20,929
Oh my god.

581
00:47:20,929 --> 00:47:21,489
Get out of the way.

582
00:47:30,929 --> 00:47:31,570
Okay, it's poisoned.

583
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:48,690
Mister-

584
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:49,570
I don't do small talk.

585
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:50,610
Mister Mailman.

586
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:54,690
There you go.

587
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:55,489
It's an open spot.

588
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:03,429
He never had french fries before?

589
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:08,480
He's very confused by french fries.

590
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:27,860
What?

591
00:48:35,989 --> 00:48:39,110
Hey, hey, just in case you want to know, man, you're sick.

592
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:42,389
You probably should go see somebody or something at some point or something.

593
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:48,519
Is this a doctor?

594
00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:51,909
Wait a minute.

595
00:48:51,909 --> 00:48:53,190
Is that his personal doctor?

596
00:48:55,190 --> 00:49:08,679
He's not going in there with him, is he?

597
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,760
Why are you both going in here?

598
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:19,489
What?

599
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:20,449
What is-

600
00:49:20,449 --> 00:49:37,039
There we go.

601
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:37,760
We got to see it.

602
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:41,760
It was an accident.

603
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:46,050
That was an accident.

604
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:47,170
I can't dress up as him?

605
00:49:47,889 --> 00:49:48,769
Oh shit.

606
00:49:48,769 --> 00:49:49,650
What do I put him?

607
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:50,150
Oh, in here.

608
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:56,789
Hold my hair, isn't it?

609
00:49:56,789 --> 00:49:57,829
That's the challenge.

610
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:00,480
He accidentally drowned.

611
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,920
All right, so now what if-

612
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,639
So I'm going to come out here and he's not going to come out.

613
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:06,000
So what does this guy have to say about that?

614
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:09,000
You know what I mean?

615
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:13,199
You're obviously waiting for him to come out of the bathroom.

616
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:33,579
What?

617
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:35,159
Why would you hear this?

618
00:50:37,889 --> 00:50:38,389
What?

619
00:50:40,469 --> 00:50:42,150
He's like, he came to investigate?

620
00:50:43,909 --> 00:50:44,409
You know.

621
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:53,119
Why would-

622
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,880
I don't understand.

623
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:55,280
Why-

624
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,239
You were standing next to the door.

625
00:50:56,239 --> 00:50:58,320
Why would you come all the way across here?

626
00:51:00,309 --> 00:51:01,510
All right, so I got-

627
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:02,010
He's dead.

628
00:51:03,159 --> 00:51:05,880
I'm going to try to make my way over to the residence.

629
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,480
I got the key now so I can just go in.

630
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:10,920
But first.

631
00:51:21,809 --> 00:51:22,309
Okay.

632
00:51:31,239 --> 00:51:31,739
No!

633
00:51:37,539 --> 00:51:39,940
That's the same person that I drowned before.

634
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:40,579
God damn it.

635
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:46,639
That's the same person I drowned.

636
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,440
All right, we're good.

637
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:58,840
We're done.

638
00:52:00,789 --> 00:52:02,389
What did that person deserve?

639
00:52:02,389 --> 00:52:03,269
Absolutely nothing.

640
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:05,670
They didn't deserve that at all.

641
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:12,820
They just happened to be standing in this spot in front of me.

642
00:52:13,989 --> 00:52:16,840
All right, so let's take a look.

643
00:52:18,039 --> 00:52:19,670
Mr. Cassidy is dead.

644
00:52:20,309 --> 00:52:24,320
The real question is.

645
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:25,840
I need to get-

646
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:26,800
I'm going to go to the front.

647
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,320
I'm going to go this way.

648
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,440
Actually, there's a clue over here.

649
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:35,380
Let's see what this is.

650
00:52:38,019 --> 00:52:38,659
Public park.

651
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:42,840
Poison water bottle.

652
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:43,559
I don't have any poison.

653
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:46,630
Pick up the hammer.

654
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:47,429
Yep.

655
00:52:47,429 --> 00:52:49,429
Charles Blake III for a better world.

656
00:52:49,429 --> 00:52:49,929
Okay.

657
00:52:55,429 --> 00:52:56,469
Oh, there's the mailman again.

658
00:52:56,469 --> 00:52:57,030
The mailman was-

659
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:57,590
What do you even-

660
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:58,710
Oh, I get it.

661
00:52:58,710 --> 00:52:59,829
Do you deliver mail?

662
00:52:59,829 --> 00:53:03,030
When I was your age, I didn't like having my route interrupted either.

663
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:04,150
I'll let you focus.

664
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:05,590
Just give it some thought.

665
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:07,510
I'll put a good word in for you if you need it.

666
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:08,150
Okay.

667
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:09,030
Thanks, I guess.

668
00:53:10,389 --> 00:53:11,510
Is this missed?

669
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:12,230
Excuse me, sir.

670
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,989
Are you a registered voter?

671
00:53:13,989 --> 00:53:17,190
I'd love to tell you about a new candidate who might just change your life.

672
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:17,590
Yes, sir.

673
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:18,869
A total game changer.

674
00:53:18,869 --> 00:53:19,190
Okay.

675
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:20,070
I'm listening.

676
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:20,570
Wonderful.

677
00:53:21,429 --> 00:53:25,110
Well, I'm sure you're aware that voting season is upon us again.

678
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:25,670
Yeah.

679
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:30,230
And if you're anything like me, a recent immigrant to this fine country,

680
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:35,329
the candidates this time around just aren't very, um, savory.

681
00:53:35,329 --> 00:53:39,010
But we have a man here today who's about to change all that.

682
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:41,329
I don't care much for politics.

683
00:53:41,329 --> 00:53:45,329
That is exactly why Blake is out ringing doorbells today.

684
00:53:45,329 --> 00:53:45,889
Mr. Cassidy.

685
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,929
He has no stakes in Washington.

686
00:53:48,929 --> 00:53:55,090
No connections to the establishment, no allies hidden away in lawless groups

687
00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:56,929
that pull the strings around the world.

688
00:53:57,969 --> 00:54:04,280
He's just a common man who decided that he wouldn't take it anymore.

689
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,239
He's looking for him.

690
00:54:05,239 --> 00:54:06,440
He's here to clean up.

691
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,039
He doesn't know where he is.

692
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:11,000
Give him exactly what you want, and to make sure the government

693
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,599
doesn't stick his nose into everything.

694
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:15,320
Fascinating.

695
00:54:16,199 --> 00:54:18,360
How is he going to achieve all that?

696
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:21,880
By imposing restrictions and pushing crippling laws

697
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:25,320
that will bind legislators to their desks for decades.

698
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:26,679
His approach-

699
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:28,440
He's going to keep doing that forever.

700
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,960
I couldn't even pay attention to this.

701
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,719
Washington-based desk jockeys.

702
00:54:31,719 --> 00:54:35,960
So much work they simply won't have time to enforce the existing laws.

703
00:54:36,519 --> 00:54:37,639
Cassidy!

704
00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:38,599
While they're busy looking-

705
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:39,559
Cassidy, can you hear me?

706
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:45,239
The law books use his executive powers to undo the existing laws.

707
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:48,119
It's a radical approach, short, but quite effective.

708
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:53,480
And this Blake character, he's out here now ringing doorbells?

709
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,039
Sure is.

710
00:54:54,039 --> 00:54:54,920
Why'd you ask?

711
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:55,639
No reason.

712
00:54:55,639 --> 00:54:56,280
Good on you.

713
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,880
Be sure to vote come election day.

714
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,239
I've got to become Mr. Blake.

715
00:54:59,239 --> 00:55:01,400
Feel free to spread the word about Charles Blake III.

716
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,280
Have a flyer.

717
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,360
Charles Blake III appreciates your support.

718
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:05,880
Well, I definitely want to-

719
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,079
Okay, he's out here ringing doorbells.

720
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:08,280
That's what he looks like.

721
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:08,780
Okay.

722
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:13,510
Hey, how are you?

723
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:14,070
How you doing?

724
00:55:17,329 --> 00:55:18,130
Is that him right there?

725
00:55:18,929 --> 00:55:21,250
That's him right there.

726
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,119
There he is.

727
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:25,840
Cassidy!

728
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:36,949
You're going to give a flyer to yourself?

729
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:46,550
I checked the phone.

730
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:51,030
Three people since morning, Aidan.

731
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:51,590
Oh, no.

732
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:52,789
We talked about the importance of the election.

733
00:55:52,789 --> 00:55:54,150
Good afternoon, sir.

734
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:56,050
Or have you completely-

735
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:57,170
We lost three followers.

736
00:55:57,170 --> 00:55:58,929
Sir, I absolutely did not.

737
00:55:58,929 --> 00:56:04,929
It's terrible, I see.

738
00:56:04,929 --> 00:56:05,969
You hear me?

739
00:56:05,969 --> 00:56:06,849
That's not fair.

740
00:56:06,849 --> 00:56:09,489
I've given out like a hundred of them already.

741
00:56:09,489 --> 00:56:12,050
I don't keep you around for your excuses.

742
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:19,360
Well, okay.

743
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,320
Have a flyer.

744
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,480
Read more about Charles Blake III in it.

745
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,480
So when does he have diarrhea?

746
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:27,960
He's going to go in that outhouse right there.

747
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,639
And I don't have-

748
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:37,280
The only intel I have on him is the flyer.

749
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:37,920
Where's the flyer?

750
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:38,719
I'm going to see the flyer.

751
00:56:42,449 --> 00:56:43,170
Apple a day.

752
00:56:45,329 --> 00:56:46,210
Whack-a-mole.

753
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:47,250
So this is not even on here.

754
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:48,210
This is a secret one.

755
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:48,530
All right.

756
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:49,250
So objectives.

757
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:51,219
Where's my-

758
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:54,280
That's not intel, the flyer.

759
00:56:56,119 --> 00:56:56,920
Free burgers.

760
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,559
In the inventory?

761
00:57:05,559 --> 00:57:09,409
Or you mean like this inventory?

762
00:57:09,409 --> 00:57:11,170
Charles Blake III appreciates your support.

763
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:11,969
Wait, I don't want to lose him.

764
00:57:13,519 --> 00:57:14,320
Where does he go?

765
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:14,639
He's going-

766
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:15,519
He goes door to door.

767
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:20,440
Okay.

768
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,559
He's going to sit here?

769
00:57:23,699 --> 00:57:24,659
Don't throw a bone at him.

770
00:57:24,659 --> 00:57:25,780
Don't do anything like that.

771
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:31,519
All right.

772
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:31,920
Let's go.

773
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:35,030
Political flyer.

774
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:37,829
This flyer outlines a political platform

775
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:40,150
of local politician wannabe Charles Blake III.

776
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:41,110
Reading through various parts,

777
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:43,190
it seems Blake is intent on using a higher office

778
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:45,030
as a way of transforming rules set forth

779
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:46,710
by the local homeowners association.

780
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:48,690
That's it.

781
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,000
I'm the only person here.

782
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:03,960
I've been here for so long too.

783
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:11,940
Yeah.

784
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:20,760
Yeah, I just-

785
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,280
I'm not sure who I want to vote for.

786
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:25,969
You seem like a nice guy.

787
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:32,440
What's your stance on more than five dogs in a house?

788
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:34,840
Would you be okay with that?

789
00:58:35,719 --> 00:58:45,619
I know you're only allowed by the state to have three.

790
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,400
But I like-

791
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,000
I like having a lot of dogs.

792
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,920
Will you move somewhere?

793
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:58,389
Mr. Blake has many important initiatives to share.

794
00:58:58,389 --> 00:58:59,110
Mr. Blake.

795
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:00,949
Did I miss everything about Mr. Blake?

796
00:59:00,949 --> 00:59:02,150
I'm not going to just shoot him.

797
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:03,110
No, I need to-

798
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:03,510
I need to-

799
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:04,550
He needs to go somewhere.

800
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:11,960
Dammit.

801
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:21,250
Is he even linked to an opportunity?

802
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:23,409
No, I just wanted to see if I could like become that guy

803
00:59:23,409 --> 00:59:24,369
and that would mean door to door

804
00:59:24,369 --> 00:59:25,570
I could go knock on the door, right?

805
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:40,980
I got an achievement for that.

806
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:41,300
Okay.

807
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,119
I know there's a-

808
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,630
I know there's a real estate thing going on.

809
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:50,150
This guy's looking around still for the-

810
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:50,949
Sir!

811
00:59:50,949 --> 00:59:52,070
Mr. Cassidy!

812
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:56,630
Are you okay?

813
00:59:56,710 --> 00:59:57,670
Nolan Cassidy!

814
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:01,340
Hey!

815
01:00:01,719 --> 01:00:03,840
How are you, Mr. Cassidy?

816
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:04,480
All right, I do-

817
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,480
I kind of need this gig, though.

818
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:06,980
What?

819
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,639
If you're unharmed, it'd be much appreciated.

820
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:11,599
He's in a random open house basement?

821
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:12,400
Mr. Cassidy!

822
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:15,730
I love hide and seek just as much as the next guy,

823
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:16,289
but come on.

824
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:30,039
Frame rate, stop!

825
01:00:31,139 --> 01:00:31,639
Hey!

826
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,679
Where are you, Mr. Cassidy?

827
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,909
I kind of need this gig,

828
01:00:35,909 --> 01:00:37,909
so if you could just show yourself unharmed,

829
01:00:37,909 --> 01:00:39,190
it'd be much appreciated.

830
01:00:39,829 --> 01:00:44,260
That's going to hurt me.

831
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:44,760
Hey!

832
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:46,559
Oh, shit!

833
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,800
That's a stone-cold knockout to the head!

834
01:01:03,239 --> 01:01:04,519
Here's the best part about this.

835
01:01:05,159 --> 01:01:06,610
He's going to wake up,

836
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:07,650
and guess what he's going to do.

837
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:10,179
Mr. Cassidy!

838
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:11,139
I don't-

839
01:01:11,139 --> 01:01:12,260
I just woke up somewhere.

840
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:13,300
I don't know where I am right now,

841
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:14,179
I'm not sure, but-

842
01:01:14,179 --> 01:01:15,219
Uh, where are you?

843
01:01:15,219 --> 01:01:16,019
Mr. Cassidy!

844
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:18,739
A very big lump on my head.

845
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:23,349
Oh, I-

846
01:01:23,349 --> 01:01:24,789
Actually, this is better disguised.

847
01:01:24,789 --> 01:01:25,750
The guy's bodyguard?

848
01:01:26,389 --> 01:01:27,349
Mr. Cassidy, I-

849
01:01:27,349 --> 01:01:28,630
I woke up naked somewhere?

850
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:31,780
I mean, I'm not sure what this is, but-

851
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:35,010
I woke up next to a plumber?

852
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:37,800
I thought it was you?

853
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:38,440
Maybe?

854
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,159
It was a person?

855
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:44,929
Are you Cassidy?

856
01:01:48,179 --> 01:01:49,219
Oh, shit!

857
01:01:49,219 --> 01:01:50,340
Uh, is there any-

858
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:50,980
Whatever.

859
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:51,619
In the basement?

860
01:01:51,619 --> 01:01:52,119
No.

861
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:53,889
You're fine.

862
01:01:53,889 --> 01:01:54,389
Close it.

863
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:55,860
All right.

864
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:56,420
I can now go-

865
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:58,500
I'm just going to walk right into the Cassidy residence.

866
01:02:01,329 --> 01:02:03,170
Mr. Cassidy, am I Cassidy?

867
01:02:03,809 --> 01:02:05,650
Have I been Cassidy the whole time?

868
01:02:06,369 --> 01:02:08,559
If you could tell me, that'd be nice, man.

869
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:12,260
All right.

870
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:12,820
Let's just-

871
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:13,460
What do I got?

872
01:02:14,019 --> 01:02:17,170
Let's go meat bone this guy in the head as hard as we can.

873
01:02:18,449 --> 01:02:18,949
Treehouse!

874
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:53,639
Please stand back.

875
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:54,360
I'll check it out.

876
01:02:56,599 --> 01:02:57,159
Take care.

877
01:02:58,119 --> 01:03:06,630
Anyone copy?

878
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:08,230
Looks like we got trouble on our hands.

879
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:08,949
Don't know what yet.

880
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:11,429
We need to secure the area.

881
01:03:11,429 --> 01:03:13,269
I need you to get a car away as possible.

882
01:03:13,269 --> 01:03:15,349
I need you to keep your head down.

883
01:03:15,349 --> 01:03:16,150
You want to stay alive.

884
01:03:16,869 --> 01:03:18,219
That lady saw me, I think.

885
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:20,860
I'm just trying to get him to come over to the-

886
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:21,739
Up in the treehouse.

887
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:27,079
What's that command?

888
01:03:27,079 --> 01:03:28,039
What's that command?

889
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:28,599
Okay.

890
01:03:28,599 --> 01:03:29,800
Yogi Bear is on the loose.

891
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:32,039
And he may have stole a picnic basket.

892
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,440
I'll be on lookout too.

893
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:41,619
Don't be kidding.

894
01:03:41,619 --> 01:03:42,119
Again?

895
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:45,769
Oh yeah, I was gonna shoot up there too.

896
01:03:46,650 --> 01:04:06,980
Come on up.

897
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:07,539
Come on up.

898
01:04:08,179 --> 01:04:11,130
Come on up.

899
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:17,940
Come on up here.

900
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:18,739
Will you get up here?

901
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:28,070
That's some strong-

902
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:28,710
I'm out.

903
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:29,349
I'm out.

904
01:04:30,389 --> 01:04:33,460
I'm out of bullets.

905
01:04:35,219 --> 01:04:36,940
I don't even know where this guy is.

906
01:04:37,659 --> 01:04:40,869
Oh, the thing that's geared by the tree.

907
01:04:40,869 --> 01:04:41,670
Mr. Cassidy!

908
01:04:42,389 --> 01:04:43,269
Mr. Cassidy!

909
01:04:49,610 --> 01:04:50,170
Is that you?

910
01:04:50,809 --> 01:04:52,469
Should I be shooting at you?

911
01:05:15,019 --> 01:05:16,860
I can't like vault over that.

912
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:17,980
That's unfortunate.

913
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:18,619
All right, let's go.

914
01:05:24,699 --> 01:05:25,199
Ow.

915
01:05:25,579 --> 01:05:33,059
I'm a bodyguard here, so I-

916
01:05:33,059 --> 01:05:33,780
This should be fine.

917
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:37,820
How would I be trespassing here?

918
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:39,019
I'm like a secret agent.

919
01:05:39,659 --> 01:05:40,380
Secret agents-

920
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:42,860
I just flash my driver's license to this guy.

921
01:05:53,179 --> 01:05:53,679
Oh!

922
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:02,059
The bird guy.

923
01:06:08,619 --> 01:06:09,119
Bird guy.

924
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:11,420
Wait, like-

925
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:12,300
Like Flavor Bird?

926
01:06:25,579 --> 01:06:26,940
I don't even need that though, man.

927
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:27,440
Look at me.

928
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:37,980
What was that for?

929
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:43,530
Why do they have a statue of like Michael Myers?

930
01:06:43,530 --> 01:06:44,329
With like an axe.

931
01:06:53,429 --> 01:06:54,469
Imagine if it was.

932
01:06:55,190 --> 01:06:58,679
Imagine if your town just had like a statue of Michael Myers.

933
01:06:58,679 --> 01:06:59,880
Like a big bronze statue.

934
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:19,460
No, I need that.

935
01:07:20,099 --> 01:07:32,619
So I'm allowed to go in the house.

936
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,099
I'm just one of the bodyguards, right?

937
01:07:35,099 --> 01:07:35,980
That would make sense.

938
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:37,519
Yeah, see?

939
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:39,019
You need a-

940
01:07:39,019 --> 01:07:40,139
What about a frisk?

941
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:41,579
I'm the one that frisks you.

942
01:07:41,579 --> 01:07:42,139
You understand?

943
01:07:44,039 --> 01:07:44,760
Who the fuck are you?

944
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,199
You can't be here.

945
01:07:46,199 --> 01:07:48,199
Who the fuck is this guy with the name tag?

946
01:07:49,079 --> 01:07:50,840
Yeah, and stay out.

947
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:51,480
Are you serious?

948
01:07:52,199 --> 01:08:07,590
To get rid of an aggressively invasive mole in this poor old man's backyard.

949
01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:09,510
Calm down, demolition man.

950
01:08:09,510 --> 01:08:12,869
Unless it's a flesh-eating mutant mole, you don't need explosives.

951
01:08:13,429 --> 01:08:16,949
We're gonna keep them safe in our trunk until you produce that license, okay?

952
01:08:16,949 --> 01:08:18,069
Come on, man.

953
01:08:18,069 --> 01:08:24,229
One of Janus's gardeners has decided to clear a series of mole tunnels using explosives.

954
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:25,350
Explosions.

955
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:30,630
I applaud his enthusiasm, but sadly, local police have confiscated his equipment.

956
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:36,550
You stuff the holes, and then you blow up the tunnel system so it collapses.

957
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:37,829
Look it up on YouTube.

958
01:08:37,829 --> 01:08:42,069
Sir, if the American pull you there, the bodyguard.

959
01:08:42,069 --> 01:08:43,270
What's this guy's problem?

960
01:08:43,829 --> 01:08:44,949
Is he your mate?

961
01:08:44,949 --> 01:08:45,989
Don't touch that.

962
01:08:45,989 --> 01:08:46,869
Get your hands off.

963
01:08:48,069 --> 01:08:49,350
Mr. Nose, are you?

964
01:08:49,989 --> 01:08:51,430
So keep your hands in the air.

965
01:08:52,229 --> 01:09:02,710
I don't want to do that, though.

966
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:10,439
I think I'd rather just go in somehow.

967
01:09:11,899 --> 01:09:16,140
I mean, explosives are fun, but I feel like I would just do that anyways, wouldn't I?

968
01:09:18,939 --> 01:09:20,380
Back to the safety of the house.

969
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:21,260
Well, not for long.

970
01:09:26,739 --> 01:09:28,340
Hey, why is this guy acting like a dog?

971
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:30,739
Shoot him.

972
01:09:31,539 --> 01:09:35,289
All right, let's do this one.

973
01:09:35,289 --> 01:09:36,250
We'll do the mole.

974
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:45,750
Seems like an interesting way to get in the house.

975
01:09:54,069 --> 01:09:55,270
All right, I have a license for it.

976
01:09:56,149 --> 01:09:56,630
This is it.

977
01:09:58,220 --> 01:09:59,420
Story revealing.

978
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:00,300
Let's save.

979
01:10:01,899 --> 01:10:02,539
Save it.

980
01:10:02,539 --> 01:10:04,060
Right back to the safety of the treehouse.

981
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:04,859
No, not for long.

982
01:10:04,859 --> 01:10:09,659
I need it to get rid of an aggressively invasive mole in this poor old man's backyard.

983
01:10:09,659 --> 01:10:11,579
Calm down, demolition man.

984
01:10:11,579 --> 01:10:13,260
Unless it's one of Janus's gods.

985
01:10:14,699 --> 01:10:15,819
You don't need explosives.

986
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:19,579
We're going to keep them safe in our trunk until you produce that license, okay?

987
01:10:19,579 --> 01:10:20,140
Yeah.

988
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:21,180
Police trunk.

989
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:22,060
Get a procedure.

990
01:10:22,699 --> 01:10:26,939
You stuff the holes, and then you blow up the tunnel system so it collapses.

991
01:10:26,939 --> 01:10:28,220
Look it up on YouTube.

992
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:31,899
Sir, if the American police force looked to YouTube as guiding principle for standard

993
01:10:31,899 --> 01:10:35,819
procedure, I'm pretty sure civilization would have collapsed a long time ago.

994
01:10:35,819 --> 01:10:36,619
God damn it.

995
01:10:37,659 --> 01:10:38,220
YouTube.

996
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:42,840
All right, so I gotta follow the gardener around.

997
01:10:51,109 --> 01:10:52,970
Yeah, that's what I like to see.

998
01:10:53,930 --> 01:10:54,090
What?

999
01:10:54,890 --> 01:10:59,460
So what's his routine?

1000
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:00,899
We're gonna find out what his routine is.

1001
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:06,779
He goes to the truck.

1002
01:11:06,779 --> 01:11:25,979
I've been holding onto that one for a long time.

1003
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:34,010
I think I've already said that.

1004
01:11:34,010 --> 01:11:35,369
Do I have said that one yet?

1005
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:38,180
I think I've already said it.

1006
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:41,220
I've been singing that like in the shower for like the last fucking three weeks.

1007
01:11:41,939 --> 01:11:45,189
I've done that already.

1008
01:11:45,189 --> 01:11:46,069
I have.

1009
01:11:46,069 --> 01:11:47,510
So I forgot that I've already said it.

1010
01:11:48,149 --> 01:11:51,659
Where can I put them?

1011
01:11:51,659 --> 01:11:58,229
Put them in the mailbox.

1012
01:11:58,229 --> 01:11:59,859
Can I put them in the trash?

1013
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:18,760
Come on, that's funny though.

1014
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,279
Like that's a funny line.

1015
01:12:22,859 --> 01:12:24,380
I can't put them in the trash.

1016
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:38,680
All right, what else do I need?

1017
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:41,420
I'm not the bodyguard anymore.

1018
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:42,460
I've got his stuff.

1019
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:47,180
That's a stand-up comic from 2002.

1020
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:48,779
That doesn't mean that it wasn't funny.

1021
01:12:51,079 --> 01:12:52,279
It wasn't meant to be funny.

1022
01:12:52,279 --> 01:12:52,840
It was meant to be.

1023
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,600
That's what I've been singing in the shower.

1024
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:58,199
While the steam fills my eyes and it fucks with my cognitive ability.

1025
01:12:58,199 --> 01:13:00,039
So obviously I thought it would be funnier.

1026
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:02,699
Sir, this is a restricted area.

1027
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:14,149
Can I pick up?

1028
01:13:14,149 --> 01:13:16,470
Oh, well, this is lagging the game.

1029
01:13:17,109 --> 01:13:19,899
Can I get in here?

1030
01:13:19,899 --> 01:13:21,689
This person had been home for a while.

1031
01:13:36,699 --> 01:13:38,539
This whole area is out of bounds.

1032
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:41,100
Whoa, psycho.

1033
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:42,060
I saw that.

1034
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:43,020
What are you, crazy?

1035
01:13:45,619 --> 01:13:46,979
Don't come in here.

1036
01:13:46,979 --> 01:13:47,539
Don't move.

1037
01:13:52,979 --> 01:13:54,100
Surrender yourself.

1038
01:13:55,539 --> 01:13:56,819
Sir, I will have to ask you.

1039
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:58,180
Look at that guy.

1040
01:13:58,180 --> 01:13:59,609
Starting street fight.

1041
01:13:59,609 --> 01:14:00,489
Suspect is hit.

1042
01:14:00,489 --> 01:14:01,210
Take him down.

1043
01:14:01,210 --> 01:14:02,329
I understand.

1044
01:14:02,329 --> 01:14:03,130
Oh my.

1045
01:14:03,130 --> 01:14:19,460
I thought I was gonna be able to get away with it.

1046
01:14:24,279 --> 01:14:25,000
What?

1047
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,579
Why did this auto save?

1048
01:14:31,369 --> 01:14:32,010
Lining up the shot.

1049
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:33,210
Hey, I was leading my target.

1050
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:34,810
He was eventually gonna come over there, guys.

1051
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:49,060
You're not allowed in here.

1052
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:49,699
Okay, sure.

1053
01:14:51,189 --> 01:14:52,069
Clown to my left.

1054
01:14:52,069 --> 01:14:52,710
Clown to my right.

1055
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:56,970
You know, where the fuck could I possibly be?

1056
01:15:10,069 --> 01:15:11,350
This is not suspicious at all.

1057
01:15:11,909 --> 01:15:14,199
I'm just checking on the fence.

1058
01:15:14,199 --> 01:15:14,699
Hey.

1059
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:16,060
Okay.

1060
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:36,880
He doesn't.

1061
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:39,579
Everything's good.

1062
01:15:39,579 --> 01:15:40,079
Okay.

1063
01:15:42,579 --> 01:15:43,300
He can hear this.

1064
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:46,020
He can hear like the animal in the bush.

1065
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:48,329
Oh god.

1066
01:15:48,329 --> 01:15:49,609
Does he even turn around?

1067
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:54,520
Geez.

1068
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:58,390
Don't come over here.

1069
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:59,270
Just, no.

1070
01:15:59,270 --> 01:15:59,829
I gotta sit.

1071
01:16:06,439 --> 01:16:19,500
Hey, you all right?

1072
01:16:23,369 --> 01:16:25,210
You must have seen the son of a bitch.

1073
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:26,409
Sorry, I didn't see nothing.

1074
01:16:26,409 --> 01:16:27,289
I have no idea.

1075
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:31,300
I got hit with meat out of a bush.

1076
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:33,300
I have no idea.

1077
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:34,180
And I'm gonna go home.

1078
01:16:34,739 --> 01:16:36,260
I'm gonna go get my mom now.

1079
01:16:36,979 --> 01:16:38,100
I pooped my pants.

1080
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:48,939
Haha, poo.

1081
01:17:01,819 --> 01:17:02,460
Well, all right.

1082
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:05,180
So I make like a reference to an old song

1083
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:08,060
and change the lyrics incredibly brilliantly.

1084
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:08,560
And I...

1085
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:10,140
That was not funny.

1086
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:11,659
I say the word poo out loud.

1087
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:14,500
I'm gonna go poo my pants.

1088
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,399
Oh, he's coming back.

1089
01:17:25,399 --> 01:17:27,159
No, I had an opportunity to do this.

1090
01:17:28,579 --> 01:17:29,939
Oh, come on.

1091
01:17:29,939 --> 01:17:30,439
Oh.

1092
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:47,880
Sir, what happened?

1093
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:48,380
I don't know.

1094
01:17:49,399 --> 01:17:50,680
I just keep falling down.

1095
01:17:51,239 --> 01:17:55,979
Oh, get up.

1096
01:17:55,979 --> 01:17:57,180
Don't waste my time.

1097
01:17:57,180 --> 01:18:00,859
Do we have any idea of the suspect?

1098
01:18:00,859 --> 01:18:01,359
What?

1099
01:18:02,979 --> 01:18:03,619
Don't go in.

1100
01:18:03,619 --> 01:18:04,899
I'm gonna take you down.

1101
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:16,939
Do you have any idea?

1102
01:18:16,939 --> 01:18:18,220
Oh, I gotta stop this.

1103
01:18:18,859 --> 01:18:19,420
What is...

1104
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:20,300
Did this just happen?

1105
01:18:20,859 --> 01:18:21,899
Oh, I got an extra chance.

1106
01:18:22,619 --> 01:18:27,720
It saved it right when he came over.

1107
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:36,869
Hey, you there.

1108
01:18:36,869 --> 01:18:41,029
You should get up now.

1109
01:18:41,029 --> 01:18:42,069
Any description?

1110
01:18:42,069 --> 01:18:43,270
What does he look like?

1111
01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:44,789
I don't see nothing.

1112
01:18:44,789 --> 01:18:45,289
Prat.

1113
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:50,090
Hey, what seems to be the trouble?

1114
01:18:50,090 --> 01:18:50,970
Rise and shine.

1115
01:18:51,930 --> 01:18:53,210
Where I pee my pant.

1116
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:54,430
Right?

1117
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:11,380
These guys are just waiting.

1118
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:11,939
They're like, you know what?

1119
01:19:11,939 --> 01:19:12,979
Let's just watch that guy.

1120
01:19:13,619 --> 01:19:14,739
See what happens to him when...

1121
01:19:15,380 --> 01:20:03,659
Oh, fuck.

1122
01:20:03,659 --> 01:20:04,300
They heard that.

1123
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:14,020
What's that doing here?

1124
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:20,079
Hey.

1125
01:20:20,779 --> 01:20:21,279
What?

1126
01:20:21,939 --> 01:20:22,439
That?

1127
01:20:25,859 --> 01:20:28,180
Why would you put it there?

1128
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:29,380
He just like said it.

1129
01:20:42,729 --> 01:20:44,329
Yeah, I think you're fine.

1130
01:20:44,329 --> 01:20:45,289
Just try and get up.

1131
01:20:45,850 --> 01:20:50,630
Do we have a description of the suspect?

1132
01:20:50,710 --> 01:20:52,869
It's all a blurry mess.

1133
01:20:52,869 --> 01:20:53,369
It could be...

1134
01:20:54,710 --> 01:21:26,920
I wish I had more items.

1135
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:28,520
That's the sad part.

1136
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,039
I wish I had every kitchen item.

1137
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:31,960
I would keep doing it to this guy.

1138
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:33,100
Forever.

1139
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:50,760
I'm gonna say that you guys might think this is not real,

1140
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:51,640
but it is real.

1141
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,520
If I was not streaming right now

1142
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:56,920
and I was just playing this game silently in my bedroom,

1143
01:21:58,199 --> 01:22:00,279
I would do that probably for two hours.

1144
01:22:00,279 --> 01:22:01,000
I probably would.

1145
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:03,750
I would probably keep doing this.

1146
01:22:04,390 --> 01:22:05,750
For like an hour and a half.

1147
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:07,189
It would just be fun.

1148
01:22:07,909 --> 01:22:12,810
Do it now.

1149
01:22:12,810 --> 01:22:13,850
I can't do it now.

1150
01:22:13,850 --> 01:22:14,569
Like, you understand?

1151
01:22:17,529 --> 01:22:19,369
There are 3,000 people here watching.

1152
01:22:19,369 --> 01:22:20,649
If I sat there for two hours

1153
01:22:20,649 --> 01:22:22,489
throwing the wrench at the fucking worker,

1154
01:22:25,239 --> 01:22:27,880
how many people do you think would be gone in 10 minutes?

1155
01:22:30,569 --> 01:22:31,609
I'm gonna say half.

1156
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:34,170
All right.

1157
01:22:34,170 --> 01:22:35,050
Infiltrate the garden.

1158
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:40,180
I would definitely not gain viewers.

1159
01:22:40,819 --> 01:22:42,460
If I...

1160
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:43,100
Oh my god.

1161
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:44,060
If I did, I don't even...

1162
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:44,539
That would be the...

1163
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:46,220
Oops-a-daisy.

1164
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:47,180
Oops-a-daisy.

1165
01:22:47,180 --> 01:22:48,220
Oops-a-daisy.

1166
01:22:48,939 --> 01:22:53,380
I have to take this guy out.

1167
01:22:53,380 --> 01:22:54,500
I have to, right?

1168
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:54,899
I have to.

1169
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:05,079
Shit.

1170
01:23:05,079 --> 01:23:06,279
The fucking security camera.

1171
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:10,060
Did you do this?

1172
01:23:10,699 --> 01:23:11,510
I don't know what happened here.

1173
01:23:11,510 --> 01:23:12,789
Fucking look at me when I'm talking.

1174
01:23:12,789 --> 01:23:21,159
Stop!

1175
01:23:21,159 --> 01:23:22,439
Put your hands up.

1176
01:23:24,359 --> 01:23:25,079
Sure, projects!

1177
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:34,069
Where was it?

1178
01:23:34,069 --> 01:23:39,210
16...

1179
01:23:39,210 --> 01:23:40,090
1651?

1180
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:42,899
Yeah.

1181
01:23:42,899 --> 01:23:44,020
Whoa, hold on a second.

1182
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:44,899
That's not the right one?

1183
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:49,100
Yeah, that's correct.

1184
01:23:49,739 --> 01:24:02,020
All right, I got my stuff.

1185
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:02,819
Wait, I need the hammer.

1186
01:24:03,619 --> 01:24:10,970
Okay, let me get over there.

1187
01:24:11,609 --> 01:24:12,729
I need to save the game.

1188
01:24:15,819 --> 01:24:17,020
Well, there it is.

1189
01:24:17,659 --> 01:24:20,300
So you can just walk around

1190
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:22,949
until you find everything.

1191
01:24:23,770 --> 01:24:24,489
That's cool.

1192
01:24:25,130 --> 01:24:26,630
All right, get to the garden.

1193
01:24:27,350 --> 01:24:33,189
I'm not going to go that way.

1194
01:24:33,909 --> 01:24:35,500
Although, why would I have to...

1195
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:36,460
I'm the gardener.

1196
01:24:38,119 --> 01:24:39,720
That guy can see through my disguise.

1197
01:24:40,279 --> 01:24:42,739
And gardening is so cool.

1198
01:24:42,739 --> 01:24:43,859
Say hi to your mother for me.

1199
01:24:47,189 --> 01:24:47,829
I'm sorry.

1200
01:24:47,829 --> 01:24:49,350
Um, I don't...

1201
01:24:49,909 --> 01:24:56,710
Okay, drop!

1202
01:24:56,710 --> 01:25:04,869
I've been recorded by a security camera.

1203
01:25:04,869 --> 01:25:07,270
I threw it into its face.

1204
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:08,390
All right, what do we need to do?

1205
01:25:09,619 --> 01:25:10,100
I'm here.

1206
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:16,409
I understand you have a mole.

1207
01:25:16,409 --> 01:25:17,529
You're a godsend.

1208
01:25:17,529 --> 01:25:18,489
Let's get straight to it.

1209
01:25:19,050 --> 01:25:20,010
The sooner this is fixed,

1210
01:25:20,010 --> 01:25:21,050
the sooner I won't have to listen

1211
01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:22,890
to Mr. Janus's complaints.

1212
01:25:22,890 --> 01:25:23,369
Follow me.

1213
01:25:30,229 --> 01:25:36,100
Oh, let's see if I can fix it with a bone.

1214
01:25:36,739 --> 01:25:40,899
As you can see, we have a mole issue.

1215
01:25:40,899 --> 01:25:41,939
Yeah, I do see that.

1216
01:25:41,939 --> 01:25:43,699
I know a permanent solution might take some time,

1217
01:25:43,699 --> 01:25:45,619
but you could just fill the holes

1218
01:25:45,619 --> 01:25:46,659
by the end of the day.

1219
01:25:46,659 --> 01:25:47,220
Yeah, I'll do it.

1220
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:52,310
Come find me when you're done.

1221
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:53,029
Okay.

1222
01:25:53,029 --> 01:25:58,069
I guess that's one way to go about it.

1223
01:25:58,069 --> 01:25:58,390
Yeah.

1224
01:25:58,390 --> 01:25:59,590
Well, he's a professional.

1225
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:12,840
Guns are the best to block holes with.

1226
01:26:13,479 --> 01:26:21,210
Danny, how does it...

1227
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:21,930
There's some over here.

1228
01:26:21,930 --> 01:26:22,430
Hold on.

1229
01:26:53,020 --> 01:26:54,699
You know all of his memorabilia.

1230
01:26:54,699 --> 01:26:55,579
You know how it works.

1231
01:26:55,579 --> 01:26:56,060
Interesting.

1232
01:26:56,699 --> 01:26:57,899
Maybe you should try to spark

1233
01:26:57,899 --> 01:26:59,739
some of those old stories from 2007.

1234
01:26:59,739 --> 01:27:00,060
What?

1235
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:02,060
Who knows what secrets Janus might reveal.

1236
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:04,380
Well, let me do this the right way.

1237
01:27:08,939 --> 01:27:09,260
I need...

1238
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:10,939
I don't have the fucking explosive device.

1239
01:27:11,899 --> 01:27:18,329
No, I'm talking about like re...

1240
01:27:18,329 --> 01:27:20,010
I blew that dude up at the door

1241
01:27:20,010 --> 01:27:20,729
that yelled at me.

1242
01:27:21,609 --> 01:27:23,210
Something bad has to happen to this guy though.

1243
01:27:28,119 --> 01:27:29,960
Why are all these doors locked?

1244
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:30,760
No, I have the key.

1245
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:32,039
I'm like popping the door.

1246
01:27:32,039 --> 01:27:33,239
I have the key in my pocket.

1247
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:41,380
Damn it.

1248
01:27:48,039 --> 01:27:48,600
Damn it.

1249
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:50,119
I was trying to see if it could...

1250
01:27:50,119 --> 01:27:51,479
I was trying to see if it could go up

1251
01:27:51,479 --> 01:27:52,439
into the camera lens.

1252
01:27:53,079 --> 01:28:01,899
Say hi to your mother for me.

1253
01:28:02,779 --> 01:28:03,180
Yeah.

1254
01:28:06,939 --> 01:28:07,659
All right.

1255
01:28:07,659 --> 01:28:08,140
Let's go.

1256
01:28:08,939 --> 01:28:12,739
Block the holes.

1257
01:28:13,619 --> 01:28:19,960
I understand you have a mole problem.

1258
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:21,579
You're a godsend.

1259
01:28:21,579 --> 01:28:22,460
Let's get straight to it.

1260
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:23,979
The sooner this is fixed,

1261
01:28:23,979 --> 01:28:25,180
the sooner I won't have to listen to Mr. James.

1262
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:26,140
Into the camera lens.

1263
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:27,579
Yeah, like I was trying to throw it in there.

1264
01:28:28,859 --> 01:28:31,029
So I'm gonna have to put an explosive

1265
01:28:31,029 --> 01:28:31,590
in one of these.

1266
01:28:32,149 --> 01:28:33,430
He's gonna come out in his garden.

1267
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:37,060
He's gonna lean down.

1268
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:39,619
Ah, I remember picking up these radishes.

1269
01:28:39,619 --> 01:28:41,460
I know a permanent solution might take some time,

1270
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:43,300
but if you could just fill the holes

1271
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:45,060
by the end of the day, great.

1272
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:47,029
Come find me when you're done.

1273
01:28:47,029 --> 01:28:51,079
Obtain an item to block the mole hole.

1274
01:29:01,239 --> 01:29:03,720
Conceal an explosive in a mole hole.

1275
01:29:05,210 --> 01:29:15,609
Well, I mean, block five more holes.

1276
01:29:16,489 --> 01:29:19,939
I gotta block...

1277
01:29:19,939 --> 01:29:21,539
I actually have to block all the holes.

1278
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:25,800
Shit.

1279
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:33,670
I don't want to get rid of the meat, though.

1280
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:35,909
Is there any random shit around here?

1281
01:29:42,939 --> 01:29:43,420
Baseball.

1282
01:29:59,539 --> 01:30:00,500
Just running around the yard,

1283
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:01,619
picking up random trash.

1284
01:30:05,609 --> 01:30:07,609
I need to find more objects.

1285
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:10,149
What?

1286
01:30:10,149 --> 01:30:10,470
What?

1287
01:30:11,189 --> 01:30:17,100
I'm just gonna put the guns in them, right?

1288
01:30:27,319 --> 01:30:28,600
I need one more blocked.

1289
01:30:29,239 --> 01:30:33,109
The less guns I have, the better.

1290
01:30:33,109 --> 01:30:33,510
That's right.

1291
01:30:34,069 --> 01:30:35,510
All right.

1292
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:35,989
I just need...

1293
01:30:35,989 --> 01:30:36,390
There it is.

1294
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:36,710
Shovel.

1295
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:39,619
All right.

1296
01:30:39,619 --> 01:30:40,579
Where's that last hole?

1297
01:30:40,579 --> 01:30:43,560
There's one gun in there.

1298
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:44,359
That one's blocked.

1299
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:45,800
This one's blocked.

1300
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:46,600
This one's blocked.

1301
01:30:47,399 --> 01:30:50,710
One more over here, right?

1302
01:30:50,710 --> 01:30:51,270
Hello, sir.

1303
01:30:52,170 --> 01:30:52,810
Yeah, there we go.

1304
01:30:55,619 --> 01:30:56,100
I can't...

1305
01:30:56,979 --> 01:31:02,890
I want that meat.

1306
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:06,579
Hold on.

1307
01:31:07,220 --> 01:31:07,939
There's a muffin here.

1308
01:31:08,579 --> 01:31:26,170
All right.

1309
01:31:26,170 --> 01:31:26,569
Done.

1310
01:31:26,569 --> 01:31:27,050
And I still...

1311
01:31:27,050 --> 01:31:27,770
I get to keep my meat.

1312
01:31:28,409 --> 01:31:28,890
That's good.

1313
01:31:31,079 --> 01:31:31,880
I'm done.

1314
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:32,520
Great.

1315
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:33,560
Let me have a quick...

1316
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:37,699
Hold on.

1317
01:31:37,699 --> 01:31:39,939
It doesn't look in it, right?

1318
01:31:40,739 --> 01:31:44,760
A bit unorthodox, maybe.

1319
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:45,960
But you got the job done.

1320
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,159
That one has a gun that...

1321
01:31:47,159 --> 01:31:47,640
Don't open it.

1322
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:49,720
I'm gonna get Mr. Janus so he can inspect it for himself.

1323
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:50,600
Inspect this one?

1324
01:31:53,770 --> 01:31:55,130
Is he gonna inspect that one?

1325
01:31:55,130 --> 01:31:56,729
Mr. Janus, the molehills have been fixed.

1326
01:31:59,020 --> 01:31:59,500
Oh, fuck.

1327
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:00,619
He's gonna pick up the guns.

1328
01:32:01,930 --> 01:32:02,329
All right.

1329
01:32:02,890 --> 01:32:05,850
Janus should be here to inspect the work soon.

1330
01:32:05,850 --> 01:32:06,329
Oh, no.

1331
01:32:07,210 --> 01:32:11,850
I'm sure this whole inspection is gonna remind Janus about something exciting from his past.

1332
01:32:11,930 --> 01:32:13,609
I'm sure that he's gonna tell us all about it.

1333
01:32:15,369 --> 01:32:16,489
Old people syndrome.

1334
01:32:17,289 --> 01:32:18,170
Anonymousgifter.

1335
01:32:19,050 --> 01:32:20,489
Better yet, keep your distance.

1336
01:32:20,489 --> 01:32:20,810
Thank you.

1337
01:32:20,810 --> 01:32:22,649
Anonymousgifter for your 10 community subs.

1338
01:32:26,789 --> 01:32:27,590
Thanks so much, dude.

1339
01:32:28,229 --> 01:32:34,699
Anonymousgifter for your 10 random subs.

1340
01:32:40,039 --> 01:32:41,880
Is he gonna actually inspect them?

1341
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:44,359
Because if so, then I'm in trouble.

1342
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:48,979
I'm afraid I'm gonna save here just in case something bad happens.

1343
01:32:49,380 --> 01:32:51,060
I'm gonna save, like, over here.

1344
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:10,500
Janus, Cold War spymaster and the first Providence constant.

1345
01:33:11,579 --> 01:33:13,100
I wonder how much he remembers.

1346
01:33:14,140 --> 01:33:15,819
How little he cares.

1347
01:33:15,819 --> 01:33:20,300
Gardner took a bit of an unorthodox approach, but they do look filled to me.

1348
01:33:21,180 --> 01:33:23,500
I think I'll be the judge of that myself.

1349
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:24,220
Thank you very much.

1350
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:26,300
He is gonna check them.

1351
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:28,979
Bulls, moles, moles.

1352
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:31,539
Reminds me of a funny story.

1353
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:33,939
Story?

1354
01:33:33,939 --> 01:33:36,500
The embassy in Nicaragua in 1986.

1355
01:33:37,220 --> 01:33:37,720
Carmen.

1356
01:33:38,579 --> 01:33:44,020
She had a charming mole right next to her perfectly luscious plump lips.

1357
01:33:44,739 --> 01:33:49,619
I discovered the mole was fake after we kissed and it got stuck on my cheek.

1358
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:56,500
I kept it in a tin box to remind me of her after they sent her to the camps.

1359
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:57,000
What?

1360
01:33:57,779 --> 01:33:59,140
He's telling the old stories?

1361
01:33:59,939 --> 01:34:05,699
I just keep hearing the...

1362
01:34:07,699 --> 01:34:15,430
Why is it the one?

1363
01:34:15,430 --> 01:34:23,939
Beautiful work.

1364
01:34:23,939 --> 01:34:25,939
The pests will soon be gone.

1365
01:34:25,939 --> 01:34:27,939
And then I can get back to planting my plants.

1366
01:34:29,939 --> 01:34:34,119
Blast reactions are the first constant to catch up with you.

1367
01:34:34,119 --> 01:34:38,869
Death feels like an easy way out for a man like Janus.

1368
01:34:38,869 --> 01:34:41,880
Still, someone's killed a lot of people.

1369
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:43,880
We are close now, gentlemen.

1370
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:49,000
Both targets are dead.

1371
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,819
Calling in, calling in!

1372
01:34:51,819 --> 01:34:53,819
Multiple homicides on our hands.

1373
01:34:53,819 --> 01:34:55,819
Someone's not happy.

1374
01:34:59,319 --> 01:35:01,319
Anybody there? Come in!

1375
01:35:01,319 --> 01:35:03,319
We got some violent jackass knocking people down.

1376
01:35:10,039 --> 01:35:12,729
Fox struck to November Zulu, over.

1377
01:35:12,729 --> 01:35:16,729
We've got a certified nuisance that needs to be addressed.

1378
01:35:16,729 --> 01:35:18,729
Is he dead? I killed him?

1379
01:35:18,729 --> 01:35:20,729
I didn't kill that guy.

1380
01:35:20,729 --> 01:35:24,119
Wait, he's talking... I thought he was...

1381
01:35:24,119 --> 01:35:32,100
Silence! Stop! He's here!

1382
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:46,180
I thought he was going to shoot the other guy.

1383
01:35:46,180 --> 01:35:53,670
That guy just backed up.

1384
01:35:53,670 --> 01:35:55,670
Blast reactions are the first constant to catch up with you.

1385
01:35:55,670 --> 01:35:57,670
Bye!

1386
01:35:57,670 --> 01:35:59,670
Death feels like an easy way out for a man like Janus.

1387
01:36:02,170 --> 01:36:04,170
Still...

1388
01:36:04,170 --> 01:36:06,170
We are close now, gentlemen.

1389
01:36:06,170 --> 01:36:12,949
Both targets are dead.

1390
01:36:12,949 --> 01:36:21,850
Think I'm going to let that guy get away with it?

1391
01:36:21,850 --> 01:36:23,850
Why? You don't remember that guy?

1392
01:36:23,850 --> 01:36:34,279
You guys just forget what that guy did?

1393
01:36:34,279 --> 01:36:48,489
I need the microfilm.

1394
01:36:48,489 --> 01:36:50,489
I should have got this first.

1395
01:36:50,489 --> 01:36:52,789
I should have got the microfilm first.

1396
01:36:52,789 --> 01:37:14,619
Is what I should have done.

1397
01:37:14,619 --> 01:37:29,020
Microfilm? Not in his bedroom?

1398
01:37:29,020 --> 01:37:31,319
There it is. Hidden microfilm.

1399
01:37:31,319 --> 01:37:33,319
One of Janus' old microfilms.

1400
01:37:33,319 --> 01:37:35,319
It might contain important information.

1401
01:37:35,319 --> 01:37:37,319
All you need now is to find a device to read it on.

1402
01:37:37,319 --> 01:37:39,319
We have to go into that other lady's house.

1403
01:37:41,319 --> 01:37:43,319
I need to be somebody else here.

1404
01:37:43,319 --> 01:37:46,579
I'm going to not save it right...

1405
01:37:46,579 --> 01:37:48,579
You!

1406
01:37:48,579 --> 01:38:05,079
Stop writing business here!

1407
01:38:05,079 --> 01:38:07,079
We are all weapons hot now.

1408
01:38:07,079 --> 01:38:13,079
You already did.

1409
01:38:13,079 --> 01:38:49,880
I already killed them both.

1410
01:38:49,880 --> 01:39:04,659
We're good?

1411
01:39:04,659 --> 01:39:08,170
Review the microfilm.

1412
01:39:08,170 --> 01:39:15,779
I think I can just go next door.

1413
01:39:15,779 --> 01:39:17,779
Wasn't the lady having a party?

1414
01:39:17,779 --> 01:39:20,220
Was it this house or the house next door?

1415
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:22,220
Where's the barbecue?

1416
01:39:22,220 --> 01:39:26,739
It's one of these.

1417
01:39:26,739 --> 01:39:28,739
You shaved your head in a few seconds?

1418
01:39:28,739 --> 01:39:45,960
I got tired of it.

1419
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:48,579
Vital info revealing.

1420
01:39:48,579 --> 01:39:50,579
I have to put the microfilm into the projector.

1421
01:39:50,579 --> 01:39:52,760
Wait, is this another...

1422
01:39:55,770 --> 01:39:57,770
I think it was the other house.

1423
01:39:57,770 --> 01:39:59,770
A robe for Janus?

1424
01:39:59,770 --> 01:40:01,770
A robe? No.

1425
01:40:01,770 --> 01:40:04,840
It was the other house.

1426
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:08,489
I remember the lady at the party was like

1427
01:40:08,489 --> 01:40:10,489
Yeah, I've got this old projector upstairs.

1428
01:40:10,489 --> 01:40:12,489
I just don't know what to do with the darn thing.

1429
01:40:12,489 --> 01:40:15,239
Alright, let's go.

1430
01:40:15,239 --> 01:40:35,500
What?

1431
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:45,460
Other side. Bye.

1432
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:57,819
There's the party.

1433
01:40:57,819 --> 01:40:59,819
He's lost. Nah, I gotta go up there.

1434
01:40:59,819 --> 01:41:05,579
Because it was in this house upstairs, right?

1435
01:41:05,579 --> 01:41:08,779
From what I remember from the conversation

1436
01:41:08,779 --> 01:41:10,779
that it's the lady right there.

1437
01:41:10,779 --> 01:41:12,779
Thanks for keeping everything safe.

1438
01:41:12,779 --> 01:41:21,220
Alright, where's your projector?

1439
01:41:21,220 --> 01:41:23,220
That's a pretty...

1440
01:41:23,220 --> 01:41:27,449
Who is this guy? Don't know, me?

1441
01:41:27,449 --> 01:41:30,779
Bob Ross.

1442
01:41:30,779 --> 01:41:32,779
You can't badmouth him, Al.

1443
01:41:32,779 --> 01:41:34,779
Shame on you.

1444
01:41:34,779 --> 01:41:36,779
Bob Ross painted this?

1445
01:41:36,779 --> 01:41:38,779
But seriously, what's the deal with all this stuff?

1446
01:41:38,779 --> 01:41:40,779
You don't think?

1447
01:41:40,779 --> 01:41:42,779
Maybe that's how they're making all their money.

1448
01:41:42,779 --> 01:41:44,779
Nobody ever got rich by cashing in

1449
01:41:44,779 --> 01:41:46,779
on their fine arts degree, Al.

1450
01:41:46,779 --> 01:41:48,779
You know that.

1451
01:41:48,779 --> 01:41:50,779
Unless they create forgeries.

1452
01:41:50,779 --> 01:41:52,779
I saw a documentary about

1453
01:41:52,779 --> 01:41:54,779
Chinese forgery factories.

1454
01:41:54,779 --> 01:41:56,779
They were literally spitting out fakes

1455
01:41:56,779 --> 01:41:58,779
left and right at millions.

1456
01:41:58,779 --> 01:42:00,779
And this, this sort of looks like

1457
01:42:00,779 --> 01:42:02,779
Pollock's number five, doesn't it?

1458
01:42:02,779 --> 01:42:04,779
No, Al. No, it doesn't.

1459
01:42:04,779 --> 01:42:07,140
Let's move on.

1460
01:42:07,140 --> 01:42:11,880
Move on, Jay.

1461
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:14,819
Alright, looking for the projector.

1462
01:42:14,819 --> 01:42:17,449
Alright, no.

1463
01:42:17,449 --> 01:42:19,750
Who the fuck is in here?

1464
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:24,550
Who's this person?

1465
01:42:24,550 --> 01:42:31,210
Did I do that?

1466
01:42:31,210 --> 01:42:39,210
I didn't do that, did I?

1467
01:42:39,210 --> 01:42:45,739
Was I here?

1468
01:42:45,739 --> 01:42:51,180
Did I hurt people up here?

1469
01:42:51,180 --> 01:42:58,149
Wilson's house key.

1470
01:42:58,149 --> 01:43:01,670
Okay.

1471
01:43:01,670 --> 01:43:03,670
Baseball. Baseball bat.

1472
01:43:03,670 --> 01:43:05,670
It's oversized, too.

1473
01:43:05,670 --> 01:43:08,420
TV.

1474
01:43:08,420 --> 01:43:14,550
Not a projector.

1475
01:43:14,550 --> 01:43:16,550
Reveal the microphone.

1476
01:43:16,550 --> 01:43:19,619
Is it upstairs?

1477
01:43:19,619 --> 01:43:21,619
Or is it downstairs?

1478
01:43:21,619 --> 01:43:25,340
I'm like right over it.

1479
01:43:25,340 --> 01:43:34,149
It's like right here.

1480
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:50,100
Don't, don't save it first

1481
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:56,380
if you're gonna, Jesus.

1482
01:43:56,380 --> 01:44:28,180
And just like that, we're gonna subvert your expectations.

1483
01:45:07,399 --> 01:45:09,399
Agent 47 doing the crab walk.

1484
01:45:09,399 --> 01:45:28,659
I gotta get, I gotta get away from here.

1485
01:45:28,659 --> 01:45:40,949
Get away.

1486
01:45:40,949 --> 01:45:44,899
No. Upstairs.

1487
01:45:44,899 --> 01:45:52,140
Where is the attic? Attic button.

1488
01:45:52,140 --> 01:45:54,140
Nope. That's not an attic pulley thing.

1489
01:45:54,140 --> 01:45:58,300
How do I get up to the attic?

1490
01:45:58,300 --> 01:46:06,170
Do I have to go like on the roof or something?

1491
01:46:06,170 --> 01:46:08,170
Cause I don't see any more stairs.

1492
01:46:08,170 --> 01:46:13,100
Over here? Attic button.

1493
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:20,010
Just in case I need it up there, you know?

1494
01:46:20,010 --> 01:46:24,810
My game. Every time I open like a new door.

1495
01:46:24,810 --> 01:46:51,100
Let's take a look.

1496
01:47:03,100 --> 01:47:07,100
How do I get out of here?

1497
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:24,149
They're both dead.

1498
01:47:24,149 --> 01:47:26,710
Locate his robe.

1499
01:47:26,710 --> 01:47:39,829
Why do I need to locate his robe?

1500
01:47:39,829 --> 01:47:52,060
I need to look at it more?

1501
01:47:52,060 --> 01:47:54,680
I think I got all the dialogue out of there.

1502
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:30,380
I'm killing so many cars right now.

1503
01:48:30,380 --> 01:49:32,949
Why would you go?

1504
01:49:32,949 --> 01:49:34,949
I just wanna throw baseball at somebody out the window.

1505
01:49:34,949 --> 01:49:47,369
That's all I wanna do.

1506
01:49:52,359 --> 01:49:54,359
There's a heart and a terminal out there.

1507
01:49:54,359 --> 01:49:57,050
They need to apprehend him.

1508
01:49:57,050 --> 01:50:01,260
Alright.

1509
01:50:01,260 --> 01:50:03,260
Security, I need some help.

1510
01:50:03,260 --> 01:50:05,560
Jesus!

1511
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:09,590
Food up. Copy.

1512
01:50:09,590 --> 01:50:31,659
Stop running, come on.

1513
01:50:31,659 --> 01:50:33,659
Oh no! No, wait!

1514
01:50:33,659 --> 01:50:35,899
Wait! No! Oh god.

1515
01:50:35,899 --> 01:50:43,130
I have to. I got it.

1516
01:50:43,130 --> 01:50:53,350
They went through.

1517
01:50:53,350 --> 01:50:56,680
So, how come I can't leave?

1518
01:50:56,680 --> 01:51:00,680
Do I actually need to like go to this guy's house and put on his robe?

1519
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:07,020
I need to find the robe.

1520
01:51:07,020 --> 01:51:10,770
So this is not just as simple as kill the two guys.

1521
01:51:10,770 --> 01:51:14,350
Alright.

1522
01:51:14,350 --> 01:51:16,850
Locate the robe.

1523
01:51:16,850 --> 01:51:25,489
I was supposed to find...

1524
01:51:25,489 --> 01:51:32,460
His house is like empty.

1525
01:51:36,770 --> 01:51:38,770
No! I got on the roof!

1526
01:51:38,770 --> 01:51:40,770
Mom, I'm not gonna be able to get it back.

1527
01:51:40,770 --> 01:51:46,079
Well, you throw it up there.

1528
01:51:46,079 --> 01:51:49,920
It's staying up there.

1529
01:52:05,630 --> 01:52:07,630
I really have to go and like do all this right now.

1530
01:52:07,630 --> 01:52:11,539
I thought I was done.

1531
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:24,340
Damn it, man.

1532
01:52:31,130 --> 01:52:33,619
Who the fuck is shooting at me?

1533
01:52:33,619 --> 01:52:41,500
The guy's just shooting through the wall.

1534
01:52:50,579 --> 01:52:53,270
Alright. Where's the microfilm?

1535
01:52:53,270 --> 01:52:55,270
Not the microfilm!

1536
01:52:55,270 --> 01:52:57,270
Where's the...

1537
01:52:57,270 --> 01:52:59,960
Where's the robe?

1538
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:04,380
I'm getting like a time loop.

1539
01:53:04,380 --> 01:53:06,380
Locate the robe.

1540
01:53:06,380 --> 01:53:11,500
That's over here.

1541
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:15,590
Hold on a second.

1542
01:53:15,590 --> 01:53:17,590
Why did they tell me to do that?

1543
01:53:17,590 --> 01:53:34,279
When they're like down here.

1544
01:53:34,279 --> 01:53:36,279
Am I still on this mission?

1545
01:53:36,279 --> 01:53:38,279
Yeah, because apparently I did it and I already did them.

1546
01:53:38,279 --> 01:53:47,880
They're already dead.

1547
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:49,880
I'm trespassing over here now.

1548
01:53:49,880 --> 01:54:09,779
God damn it.

1549
01:54:09,779 --> 01:54:13,180
I'm found trespassing right now.

1550
01:54:13,180 --> 01:54:15,180
Where do I need to go?

1551
01:54:15,180 --> 01:54:17,180
I need to go to like the other place next door.

1552
01:54:17,180 --> 01:54:19,609
Or objective clue reveal.

1553
01:54:19,609 --> 01:54:31,060
I'm just going to load the save.

1554
01:54:31,060 --> 01:54:38,300
It's going to go from...

1555
01:54:38,300 --> 01:54:40,300
Let's go from here.

1556
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:46,310
Is he still trying to throw a brick?

1557
01:54:46,310 --> 01:54:48,310
Wait a minute.

1558
01:54:48,310 --> 01:54:50,310
Let me read the intel to see why I can't leave.

1559
01:54:50,310 --> 01:54:58,380
So I need to...

1560
01:54:58,380 --> 01:55:03,819
I need to do this.

1561
01:55:03,819 --> 01:55:05,819
So that's the meeting point, right?

1562
01:55:05,819 --> 01:55:07,819
Didn't I already do this?

1563
01:55:07,819 --> 01:55:13,640
Like didn't I already reveal the meeting point?

1564
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:15,640
And that's just where I need to go.

1565
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:24,279
So constant meeting confirmed.

1566
01:55:24,279 --> 01:55:28,890
That's what I needed, right?

1567
01:55:28,890 --> 01:55:30,890
Confirm an existing connection between the constant

1568
01:55:30,890 --> 01:55:32,890
and reveal a date they would meet.

1569
01:55:32,890 --> 01:55:34,890
So it's like in his robe somewhere.

1570
01:55:34,890 --> 01:55:39,420
Alright.

1571
01:55:39,420 --> 01:55:41,420
This is the first mission that they've done where I've had to actually

1572
01:55:41,420 --> 01:55:43,420
complete like the clue parts.

1573
01:55:43,420 --> 01:55:45,420
It was just do the mission, kill the guy, and leave.

1574
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:50,600
So I'm going to go

1575
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:56,100
over here.

1576
01:55:56,100 --> 01:55:59,689
I'm going to go back to the Cassidy property.

1577
01:55:59,689 --> 01:56:07,180
Hopefully nobody freaks out about this.

1578
01:56:07,180 --> 01:56:09,180
Can I like jump down from here?

1579
01:56:09,180 --> 01:56:12,119
Come on. I can't just jump down from here.

1580
01:56:12,119 --> 01:56:18,699
Alright. Well, whatever.

1581
01:56:18,699 --> 01:56:27,079
Walk out the front door.

1582
01:56:27,079 --> 01:56:32,970
Perfectly normal, but throwing

1583
01:56:32,970 --> 01:56:34,970
baseballs is illegal.

1584
01:56:34,970 --> 01:56:37,960
Alright.

1585
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:39,960
So it's just this house right here.

1586
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:41,960
I'm not allowed to be in here, but

1587
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:43,960
I'm going to find the meeting point.

1588
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:46,840
Don't load it. Save it.

1589
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:52,279
That's a clue reveal I'm going to.

1590
01:56:52,279 --> 01:56:55,670
Don't I have to do it all?

1591
01:56:55,670 --> 01:56:57,670
Or do I just have to go get the robe?

1592
01:56:57,670 --> 01:57:02,090
Is that the only thing I have to do?

1593
01:57:02,090 --> 01:57:08,739
Just get the robe.

1594
01:57:08,739 --> 01:57:10,739
You have to do them both.

1595
01:57:10,739 --> 01:57:14,840
Well, I'm right here. I'm going to do it.

1596
01:57:14,840 --> 01:57:24,119
I'm currently trespassing again.

1597
01:57:24,119 --> 01:57:28,279
I'm going to save it right here.

1598
01:57:28,279 --> 01:57:33,020
Just find it.

1599
01:57:33,020 --> 01:57:35,020
I thought

1600
01:57:35,020 --> 01:57:37,020
whatever.

1601
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:41,880
Golf.

1602
01:57:41,880 --> 01:58:02,090
Okay.

1603
01:58:02,090 --> 01:58:08,619
He's upstairs. Apparently whoever

1604
01:58:08,619 --> 01:58:10,619
it is is up there.

1605
01:58:10,619 --> 01:58:18,739
Okay. Let's go stare at him.

1606
01:58:18,739 --> 01:58:28,329
Hello. Hi.

1607
01:58:28,329 --> 01:58:36,970
Alright. Found the meeting point.

1608
01:58:36,970 --> 01:58:40,869
Tactical bathroom.

1609
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:47,300
No.

1610
01:58:47,300 --> 01:58:49,300
No.

1611
01:58:57,909 --> 01:58:59,909
I don't know where he went.

1612
01:58:59,909 --> 01:59:01,909
He was somewhere. Tactical.

1613
01:59:01,909 --> 01:59:05,750
So I don't have the clue now.

1614
01:59:05,750 --> 01:59:12,460
Now I have to go.

1615
01:59:12,460 --> 01:59:15,020
Alright. So

1616
01:59:15,020 --> 01:59:17,020
was that guy supposed to have a conversation?

1617
01:59:17,020 --> 01:59:40,630
Because now I have to go over here.

1618
01:59:40,630 --> 01:59:44,220
Okay. Let's go get the robe.

1619
01:59:44,220 --> 01:59:47,930
I can't save it yet.

1620
01:59:47,930 --> 01:59:50,619
So the robe is now.

1621
01:59:50,619 --> 01:59:55,800
Okay. Straight ahead.

1622
01:59:55,800 --> 02:00:03,659
The robe.

1623
02:00:03,659 --> 02:00:05,659
Hi.

1624
02:00:05,659 --> 02:00:09,689
Well, I would have done this first.

1625
02:00:09,689 --> 02:00:12,119
I didn't know I had

1626
02:00:12,119 --> 02:00:14,359
to do all this.

1627
02:00:14,359 --> 02:00:16,359
I guess here.

1628
02:00:16,359 --> 02:00:18,359
When it says eliminate, eliminate. Oh.

1629
02:00:18,359 --> 02:00:20,359
So you have to do this too.

1630
02:00:20,359 --> 02:00:22,359
I just pressed the button.

1631
02:00:22,359 --> 02:00:25,689
Let's go. I would have done this all

1632
02:00:25,689 --> 02:00:29,399
in reverse.

1633
02:00:29,399 --> 02:00:32,340
So I need to. I don't want to like pop that

1634
02:00:32,340 --> 02:00:34,340
in front of everybody. But I think I have to.

1635
02:00:34,340 --> 02:00:44,970
Hey. What if I happen to. I get to do what I want

1636
02:00:44,970 --> 02:00:51,619
in Hitman. What happened to that?

1637
02:00:51,619 --> 02:00:53,619
I have to go find these clues?

1638
02:00:53,619 --> 02:00:55,619
No. Just stuff them in the guy's pocket.

1639
02:00:55,619 --> 02:01:05,800
He should have a map to

1640
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:07,800
Oh. The guy should have a map up his ass.

1641
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:13,180
I'll have his fucking shotgun.

1642
02:01:13,180 --> 02:02:08,970
The robe is upstairs.

1643
02:02:08,970 --> 02:02:23,050
Why do I keep having the door?

1644
02:02:23,050 --> 02:02:29,319
Okay. Give me the bathrobe.

1645
02:02:29,319 --> 02:02:34,180
A ceremonial robe of some sort

1646
02:02:34,180 --> 02:02:36,180
with a note from Janus attached.

1647
02:02:36,180 --> 02:02:39,829
The note is interesting.

1648
02:02:39,829 --> 02:02:42,069
Janus has asked Helen

1649
02:02:42,069 --> 02:02:44,069
to do a few repairs on the robe before he leaves

1650
02:02:44,069 --> 02:02:46,069
for his annual trip.

1651
02:02:46,069 --> 02:02:48,069
He even put a date there.

1652
02:02:48,069 --> 02:02:50,069
This is valuable information, 47.

1653
02:02:50,069 --> 02:02:55,319
So I just had to pick up the robe.

1654
02:02:55,319 --> 02:03:17,979
That's all I had to do.

1655
02:03:17,979 --> 02:03:19,979
The shotgun? I'll be fine.

1656
02:03:19,979 --> 02:03:28,550
That's Gandalf cosplay.

1657
02:03:28,550 --> 02:03:34,380
What's really facing?

1658
02:03:34,380 --> 02:03:41,590
Who saw me here?

1659
02:03:41,590 --> 02:03:43,590
I don't know what he's reading.

1660
02:03:43,590 --> 02:03:45,590
But it looks like it's the most

1661
02:03:45,590 --> 02:03:47,590
interesting thing he's ever come across.

1662
02:03:47,590 --> 02:03:49,590
The new Cassandra Snow novel.

1663
02:03:49,590 --> 02:03:51,590
What do you have to do with this?

1664
02:03:51,590 --> 02:03:53,590
What do you have to do with this?

1665
02:03:53,590 --> 02:03:55,590
You're just on a jog.

1666
02:03:55,590 --> 02:03:57,770
You're on a jog.

1667
02:03:57,770 --> 02:03:59,770
Why would you be like one of the sentries

1668
02:03:59,770 --> 02:04:01,770
that can see through my disguise?

1669
02:04:12,890 --> 02:04:16,859
Oh. It's the fucking shotgun.

1670
02:04:16,859 --> 02:04:18,859
I'll be fine, guys.

1671
02:04:18,859 --> 02:04:35,109
Alright. Let's go.

1672
02:04:35,109 --> 02:04:56,039
Shotgun, whether it sounds like it's something I want to play

1673
02:04:56,039 --> 02:04:58,039
in Dungeons & Dragons.

1674
02:05:16,199 --> 02:05:18,199
Out of my face.

1675
02:05:32,760 --> 02:05:42,170
Alright.

1676
02:05:42,170 --> 02:05:49,909
Who the fuck is this?

1677
02:05:49,909 --> 02:05:53,109
Is this guy reading Janus's diary?

1678
02:05:57,590 --> 02:05:59,590
Is that his diary?

1679
02:05:59,590 --> 02:06:02,409
He's got all kinds of math problems in there.

1680
02:06:02,409 --> 02:06:21,739
Alright, give me that diary.

1681
02:06:21,739 --> 02:06:34,470
It's in a weird spot.

1682
02:06:38,470 --> 02:06:40,470
Can I just leave?

1683
02:06:48,470 --> 02:06:50,470
We now know Janus is meeting

1684
02:06:50,470 --> 02:06:52,470
with the Constant at an event related

1685
02:06:52,470 --> 02:06:54,470
to the Ark Society.

1686
02:06:54,470 --> 02:06:56,470
And we have an approximate date as well.

1687
02:06:56,470 --> 02:06:58,470
I think that's all we're going to get.

1688
02:06:58,470 --> 02:07:00,470
We're close to the finish line.

1689
02:07:00,470 --> 02:07:02,470
It's time to end this.

1690
02:07:02,470 --> 02:07:04,470
Yeah.

1691
02:07:04,470 --> 02:07:06,470
Mission objectives are completed.

1692
02:07:06,470 --> 02:07:08,470
47, once you've left Wittleton Creek

1693
02:07:08,470 --> 02:07:10,470
I will notify Providence of our

1694
02:07:10,470 --> 02:07:12,470
discovery.

1695
02:07:12,470 --> 02:07:14,470
In the meantime, we'll go over the clues

1696
02:07:14,470 --> 02:07:16,470
you've found.

1697
02:07:16,470 --> 02:07:18,470
Once we've located the Constant,

1698
02:07:18,470 --> 02:07:20,470
we'll make our final move.

1699
02:07:29,819 --> 02:07:31,819
Let's go!

1700
02:07:31,819 --> 02:07:51,770
See you later, sucker!

1701
02:07:51,770 --> 02:07:53,770
Past, the present, breaking news.

1702
02:07:53,770 --> 02:08:01,899
Wear the robe.

1703
02:08:01,899 --> 02:08:05,100
I feel like that's what Chad has been saying

1704
02:08:05,100 --> 02:08:07,100
for the last 30 straight minutes.

1705
02:08:07,100 --> 02:08:19,500
Zero stars, here it comes.

1706
02:08:19,500 --> 02:08:21,500
Well, you can't get stars if you

1707
02:08:21,500 --> 02:08:24,180
throw fire extinguishers

1708
02:08:24,180 --> 02:08:26,180
at people at some point for the mission.

1709
02:08:26,180 --> 02:08:28,180
Like, I just, I can't, that's how I like to play.

1710
02:08:28,180 --> 02:08:32,859
In one hour, the last mission

1711
02:08:32,859 --> 02:08:34,859
took an hour. The mission before that took

1712
02:08:34,859 --> 02:08:47,779
an hour. To get five stars

1713
02:08:47,779 --> 02:08:49,779
I would have to just sneak around,

1714
02:08:49,779 --> 02:08:52,659
do everything by the book.

1715
02:08:52,659 --> 02:08:54,659
You wouldn't get to see a baseball

1716
02:08:54,659 --> 02:08:56,659
get thrown, because I wouldn't be able to do that.

1717
02:08:56,659 --> 02:09:04,409
I got an auto-MK2.

1718
02:09:04,409 --> 02:09:11,960
I did, I got like halfway

1719
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:26,619
into trying this one.

1720
02:09:26,619 --> 02:09:28,619
The Ark Society.

1721
02:09:28,619 --> 02:09:30,619
One of Providence's more

1722
02:09:30,619 --> 02:09:32,619
obscure outfits.

1723
02:09:32,619 --> 02:09:34,619
I've heard whispers.

1724
02:09:34,619 --> 02:09:36,619
A survivalist club for the global

1725
02:09:36,619 --> 02:09:38,619
elite. Billionaires preparing

1726
02:09:38,619 --> 02:09:40,619
for a global collapse.

1727
02:09:40,619 --> 02:09:42,619
And now we know the constant will attend their next

1728
02:09:42,619 --> 02:09:44,619
gathering. So where is it?

1729
02:09:44,619 --> 02:09:46,619
That's the catch.

1730
02:09:46,619 --> 02:09:48,619
The report is redacted.

1731
02:09:48,619 --> 02:09:50,619
No names, no location.

1732
02:09:50,619 --> 02:09:52,619
So it's a dead end.

1733
02:09:52,619 --> 02:09:54,619
I can't track them, not without ICA

1734
02:09:54,619 --> 02:09:56,619
backup.

1735
02:09:56,619 --> 02:09:58,619
Now, I'm no big shot

1736
02:09:58,619 --> 02:10:00,619
analyst, but

1737
02:10:00,619 --> 02:10:02,619
there are two missions left.

1738
02:10:37,939 --> 02:10:40,569
So we've got a split personality here.

1739
02:10:40,569 --> 02:10:42,569
He's like inside of my head.

1740
02:10:42,569 --> 02:10:45,060
Wow.

1741
02:10:45,060 --> 02:10:47,060
Same person.

1742
02:11:15,020 --> 02:11:17,020
I don't have a problem with this.

1743
02:11:17,020 --> 02:11:21,369
I mean, they're short anyways.

1744
02:11:21,369 --> 02:11:23,369
It's not like they're big, elaborate cutscenes.

1745
02:11:23,369 --> 02:11:25,369
They just are there in between.

1746
02:11:25,369 --> 02:11:30,869
The Ark Society.

1747
02:12:05,640 --> 02:12:07,640
That animal is twice as dangerous.

1748
02:12:07,640 --> 02:12:09,640
Let's be perfectly clear.

1749
02:12:09,640 --> 02:12:11,640
We were not

1750
02:12:11,640 --> 02:12:13,640
exposed. The threat

1751
02:12:13,640 --> 02:12:15,640
is neutralized.

1752
02:12:15,640 --> 02:12:17,640
We are back on track.

1753
02:12:17,640 --> 02:12:19,640
Even so, from this

1754
02:12:19,640 --> 02:12:21,640
point on, we expect you to take...

1755
02:12:21,640 --> 02:12:23,640
No. There is no way I'm

1756
02:12:23,640 --> 02:12:26,199
doing that. Question my

1757
02:12:26,199 --> 02:12:28,199
loyalty. In case treachery

1758
02:12:28,199 --> 02:12:30,199
is contagious.

1759
02:12:30,199 --> 02:12:32,199
Do you really want to

1760
02:12:32,199 --> 02:12:34,199
do this to me?

1761
02:12:34,199 --> 02:12:37,590
Is there a problem, secretary?

1762
02:12:37,590 --> 02:12:43,100
No

1763
02:12:43,100 --> 02:12:45,100
problem whatsoever,

1764
02:12:45,100 --> 02:12:47,100
madam.

1765
02:12:47,100 --> 02:12:52,899
What? Was this a VR game?

1766
02:12:52,899 --> 02:12:56,619
Apparently that's all that was.

1767
02:12:56,619 --> 02:13:06,979
Here's

1768
02:13:06,979 --> 02:13:08,979
to loyalty.

1769
02:13:08,979 --> 02:13:24,859
It's that the constant has arrived.

1770
02:13:24,859 --> 02:13:26,859
We had outed somehow.

1771
02:13:26,859 --> 02:13:28,859
Classic Syringo.

1772
02:13:28,859 --> 02:13:30,859
In case the crew get ideas.

1773
02:13:30,859 --> 02:13:33,159
Why are you doing

1774
02:13:33,159 --> 02:13:35,159
this, Mr. Gray? You had a chance

1775
02:13:35,159 --> 02:13:37,159
to walk away. Why didn't you?

1776
02:13:37,159 --> 02:13:41,000
A year ago

1777
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
I'm working security

1778
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
for this banker, Cobb.

1779
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Only to find out he's

1780
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
a Providence operative.

1781
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,500
I've been running for decades

1782
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:53,500
only to wind up where I started.

1783
02:13:53,500 --> 02:13:55,500
We've all got

1784
02:13:55,500 --> 02:13:57,500
barcodes on the back of our heads.

1785
02:13:57,500 --> 02:13:59,500
Most people just never notice.

1786
02:13:59,500 --> 02:14:04,420
47 told me about

1787
02:14:04,420 --> 02:14:06,859
your parents. How did

1788
02:14:06,859 --> 02:14:10,890
they die? Car bomb.

1789
02:14:10,890 --> 02:14:12,890
Sorry, 1989.

1790
02:14:12,890 --> 02:14:14,890
Company named Blue Seed

1791
02:14:14,890 --> 02:14:16,890
didn't care to pay for the mistakes.

1792
02:14:16,890 --> 02:14:18,890
But I like to think

1793
02:14:18,890 --> 02:14:20,890
no one's

1794
02:14:20,890 --> 02:14:25,560
untouchable.

1795
02:14:25,560 --> 02:14:27,560
I'm sorry for your loss.

1796
02:14:27,560 --> 02:14:29,560
You feel it.

1797
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:31,800
Unlike him, you feel it all.

1798
02:14:31,800 --> 02:14:33,800
Everything you've done.

1799
02:14:33,800 --> 02:14:38,470
It's a dangerous thing.

1800
02:14:40,970 --> 02:14:42,970
Having a conscience.

1801
02:14:42,970 --> 02:14:45,529
I was gonna make a Star Wars joke,

1802
02:14:45,529 --> 02:14:47,529
but I'm gonna let you guys do it.

1803
02:14:47,529 --> 02:14:50,149
If I make the Star Wars joke, everyone's gonna

1804
02:14:50,149 --> 02:14:55,529
fucking scream at me.

1805
02:14:55,529 --> 02:14:57,529
If I leaned in the mic right there and I was like, you failed too.

1806
02:14:57,529 --> 02:15:00,340
I would've seen minus two's

1807
02:15:00,340 --> 02:15:06,680
the whole time.

1808
02:15:06,680 --> 02:15:09,369
So, here's the Ark Society.

1809
02:15:09,369 --> 02:15:11,859
Attention, gentlemen.

1810
02:15:11,859 --> 02:15:13,859
Our source on the island

1811
02:15:13,859 --> 02:15:15,859
just made a critical discovery.

1812
02:15:15,859 --> 02:15:17,859
The Constant has a poison chip

1813
02:15:17,859 --> 02:15:19,859
embedded in his neck.

1814
02:15:19,859 --> 02:15:21,859
A failsafe, in case he's compromised.

1815
02:15:21,859 --> 02:15:23,859
He can't die.

1816
02:15:23,859 --> 02:15:25,859
Keep him alive.

1817
02:15:27,859 --> 02:15:29,859
Just feed him Red Bulls.

1818
02:15:53,859 --> 02:15:55,859
I figure out a way to get the Constant off the island.

1819
02:15:55,859 --> 02:15:57,859
It'll be tight.

1820
02:15:57,859 --> 02:15:59,859
But once we're back at the ship, we should be able to surgically remove

1821
02:15:59,859 --> 02:16:01,859
the chip before the partners have time to react.

1822
02:16:01,859 --> 02:16:03,859
But I'm sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

1823
02:16:03,859 --> 02:16:05,859
I have my headphones in.

1824
02:16:05,859 --> 02:16:08,300
Zoe and Sophia's father

1825
02:16:08,300 --> 02:16:10,300
is president of a powerful conservative

1826
02:16:10,300 --> 02:16:12,300
think tank. One of Providence's

1827
02:16:12,300 --> 02:16:14,300
prime assets.

1828
02:16:14,300 --> 02:16:16,600
The apples don't fall far

1829
02:16:16,600 --> 02:16:18,600
from the tree.

1830
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:20,600
No saints either. According to ICA files,

1831
02:16:20,600 --> 02:16:22,600
the twins are pampered socialites

1832
02:16:22,600 --> 02:16:24,600
who get their kicks from treasure hunting.

1833
02:16:24,600 --> 02:16:26,600
Commanding a band of trigger-happy

1834
02:16:26,600 --> 02:16:28,600
mercenaries, Zoe and Sophia

1835
02:16:28,600 --> 02:16:30,600
prowl the world in search for ancient

1836
02:16:30,600 --> 02:16:32,600
relics. With little regard for

1837
02:16:32,600 --> 02:16:34,600
local culture, or even human life,

1838
02:16:34,600 --> 02:16:36,600
they stop at nothing to claim

1839
02:16:36,600 --> 02:16:38,600
their primes. Well,

1840
02:16:38,600 --> 02:16:40,600
collateral damage they may be,

1841
02:16:40,600 --> 02:16:42,600
but safe to say, they have coming.

1842
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:44,600
So, kill them both.

1843
02:16:44,600 --> 02:16:52,260
Alright. Hold on a minute.

1844
02:16:52,260 --> 02:16:54,260
Let me make sure, okay.

1845
02:16:54,260 --> 02:16:56,260
Zoe, Washington.

1846
02:16:56,260 --> 02:16:58,260
Any disguise, any method.

1847
02:16:58,260 --> 02:17:00,260
Any disguise, any method.

1848
02:17:00,260 --> 02:17:02,440
Do not

1849
02:17:02,440 --> 02:17:04,440
eliminate the constant.

1850
02:17:04,440 --> 02:17:06,620
Do not kill this person.

1851
02:17:06,620 --> 02:17:09,299
That's it. There's no

1852
02:17:09,299 --> 02:17:11,299
clues, or fine clues.

1853
02:17:11,299 --> 02:17:13,299
Just don't kill him, kill them.

1854
02:17:13,299 --> 02:17:22,459
Okay.

1855
02:17:22,459 --> 02:17:26,809
Planning. Take the silver ballers.

1856
02:17:26,809 --> 02:17:28,809
Yep. I'll wear my...

1857
02:17:28,809 --> 02:17:31,049
That's not a really good

1858
02:17:31,049 --> 02:17:33,219
costume. Why wouldn't I put on

1859
02:17:33,219 --> 02:17:35,219
a wig? Me putting a wig

1860
02:17:35,219 --> 02:17:37,219
on is more effective than me covering

1861
02:17:37,219 --> 02:17:49,959
my eyes and nose.

1862
02:17:49,959 --> 02:17:52,200
What's he got?

1863
02:17:52,200 --> 02:17:54,200
Proximity.

1864
02:17:54,200 --> 02:17:57,079
Breed case. I'm gonna

1865
02:17:57,079 --> 02:17:59,079
travel breed case. I keep the lockpick

1866
02:17:59,079 --> 02:18:04,520
and the fish. Wear the

1867
02:18:04,520 --> 02:18:08,489
robe. I don't have

1868
02:18:08,489 --> 02:18:11,940
the robe. I don't have

1869
02:18:11,940 --> 02:18:13,940
the robe. Alright, ready?

1870
02:18:13,940 --> 02:18:30,569
Let's go.

1871
02:18:30,569 --> 02:18:32,569
47 was the channel for Nickelodeon in my

1872
02:18:32,569 --> 02:18:34,569
grandma's house when I was a kid.

1873
02:18:34,569 --> 02:18:38,729
What?

1874
02:18:38,729 --> 02:18:40,729
Alright.

1875
02:18:42,729 --> 02:18:46,059
Same, same.

1876
02:18:46,059 --> 02:18:48,059
Was it?

1877
02:18:48,059 --> 02:18:50,059
I don't know what it was for mine.

1878
02:19:02,360 --> 02:19:04,540
I feel like it was somewhere in the Twins.

1879
02:19:08,540 --> 02:19:12,120
Okay.

1880
02:19:28,120 --> 02:19:30,120
This is an interesting castle.

1881
02:19:36,120 --> 02:19:41,049
This is just the first part of

1882
02:19:41,049 --> 02:19:43,049
Bioshock Infinite.

1883
02:19:43,049 --> 02:19:45,219
Don't kill the constant.

1884
02:19:45,219 --> 02:19:58,579
Alright.

1885
02:19:58,579 --> 02:20:00,950
Hold on, one second. I need to look at this.

1886
02:20:00,950 --> 02:20:03,959
Uh...

1887
02:20:03,959 --> 02:20:05,959
What is this?

1888
02:20:05,959 --> 02:20:10,500
Oh, nope. Nevermind, I'm good.

1889
02:20:10,500 --> 02:20:12,500
Alright. So...

1890
02:20:12,500 --> 02:20:14,500
Eliminate the

1891
02:20:14,500 --> 02:20:16,500
Zoe Washington, Sophia Washington, the both over there.

1892
02:20:16,500 --> 02:20:18,500
Don't kill that guy who's trapped

1893
02:20:18,500 --> 02:20:20,500
in what seems to be a

1894
02:20:20,500 --> 02:20:23,379
bubble.

1895
02:20:23,379 --> 02:20:25,379
Yes.

1896
02:20:27,379 --> 02:20:29,379
Alright.

1897
02:20:52,899 --> 02:20:54,899
We're gonna get a tour?

1898
02:20:54,899 --> 02:20:56,899
Alright. But, what's that

1899
02:20:56,899 --> 02:20:58,899
though?

1900
02:20:58,899 --> 02:21:00,899
No, let's do the tour. That's what I want to do.

1901
02:21:02,899 --> 02:21:07,639
He just said epic, he did it.

1902
02:21:07,639 --> 02:21:12,379
This place is epic.

1903
02:21:12,379 --> 02:21:19,100
Some people are saying you need to take

1904
02:21:19,100 --> 02:21:21,979
his robe. All in due

1905
02:21:21,979 --> 02:21:23,979
time, guys. It's all in due time.

1906
02:21:23,979 --> 02:21:28,579
My god. I don't know why

1907
02:21:28,579 --> 02:21:30,579
every time I load another area, I just

1908
02:21:30,579 --> 02:21:32,760
mmmmgggg.

1909
02:21:40,760 --> 02:21:42,760
Why didn't he do anything?

1910
02:21:42,760 --> 02:21:44,760
He's getting

1911
02:21:44,760 --> 02:21:46,760
closer to me.

1912
02:21:55,319 --> 02:22:13,430
Good to see you, friend.

1913
02:22:13,430 --> 02:22:17,590
Good to see you too.

1914
02:22:17,590 --> 02:22:20,219
By the way, do you need to

1915
02:22:20,219 --> 02:22:22,649
pee or anything?

1916
02:22:22,649 --> 02:22:38,120
Just curious.

1917
02:22:38,120 --> 02:22:40,120
It's hard to do 47's voice.

1918
02:22:40,120 --> 02:22:42,120
There's nobody... Ah, there are people over here.

1919
02:22:42,120 --> 02:22:45,129
Yes, hello.

1920
02:22:45,129 --> 02:22:48,389
Hello, hello.

1921
02:22:48,389 --> 02:22:52,420
Hey, look, a guy on a piano!

1922
02:22:52,420 --> 02:23:12,260
Now, so by the way, I just

1923
02:23:12,260 --> 02:23:14,260
reduced my score by two stars, I think.

1924
02:23:14,260 --> 02:23:22,520
Okay, so it's a party.

1925
02:23:28,520 --> 02:23:30,520
Should I get a drink?

1926
02:23:30,520 --> 02:23:32,520
We got sushi.

1927
02:23:34,520 --> 02:23:42,250
Popcorn.

1928
02:23:42,250 --> 02:23:44,250
Popcorn.

1929
02:23:46,250 --> 02:23:59,940
This drink isn't even... There he is.

1930
02:23:59,940 --> 02:24:06,469
I just took a sip out of somebody

1931
02:24:06,469 --> 02:24:08,469
else's wine and put it back down.

1932
02:24:08,469 --> 02:24:12,309
Where's he going?

1933
02:24:12,309 --> 02:24:14,309
Is he going up to the...

1934
02:24:14,309 --> 02:24:16,309
This is definitely off limits, right?

1935
02:24:16,309 --> 02:24:18,309
I mean, there's a blood-borne cage

1936
02:24:18,309 --> 02:24:21,319
over there. Where's he going?

1937
02:24:21,319 --> 02:24:25,159
Is he going to make an announcement

1938
02:24:25,159 --> 02:24:27,159
or something?

1939
02:24:27,159 --> 02:24:31,899
Let's explore.

1940
02:24:31,899 --> 02:24:33,899
Now, he is going to make an

1941
02:24:33,899 --> 02:24:35,899
announcement.

1942
02:24:53,610 --> 02:24:55,610
I think I'm just going to be with

1943
02:24:55,610 --> 02:24:57,610
the party.

1944
02:24:57,610 --> 02:24:59,610
Okay, everyone's going to go

1945
02:24:59,610 --> 02:25:01,610
to the upper courtyard.

1946
02:25:06,920 --> 02:25:12,420
Does nobody else care about this? Why are only like three people

1947
02:25:12,420 --> 02:25:20,420
going? Off limits?

1948
02:25:20,420 --> 02:25:22,420
Is this off limits? Off limits.

1949
02:25:22,420 --> 02:25:26,389
Are we off limits?

1950
02:25:28,389 --> 02:25:38,700
No, I got to keep up with the group.

1951
02:25:38,700 --> 02:25:40,700
That thing's going to slide.

1952
02:25:40,700 --> 02:25:55,159
Initiation door.

1953
02:25:55,159 --> 02:25:57,159
A locked door leads to the castle basement with it.

1954
02:25:57,159 --> 02:25:59,159
Initiation interview with Zoe

1955
02:25:59,159 --> 02:26:01,159
Washington will take place, but to gain

1956
02:26:01,159 --> 02:26:03,159
admittance, initiates need to collect a number of tokens.

1957
02:26:03,159 --> 02:26:11,159
So,

1958
02:26:11,159 --> 02:26:13,590
to get through to

1959
02:26:13,590 --> 02:26:18,780
Munchkinland, I need tokens.

1960
02:26:18,780 --> 02:26:21,909
This is cool.

1961
02:26:25,180 --> 02:26:35,670
What the hell is this?

1962
02:26:35,670 --> 02:26:37,670
Then the Olympics can now

1963
02:26:37,670 --> 02:26:51,049
begin.

1964
02:26:51,049 --> 02:26:53,290
I'm going to get the gold medal.

1965
02:26:53,290 --> 02:26:55,530
Come on, I got to win the gold medal.

1966
02:26:55,530 --> 02:27:13,260
For swinging at people.

1967
02:27:13,260 --> 02:27:17,860
Is this money?

1968
02:27:17,860 --> 02:27:21,059
You throw

1969
02:27:21,059 --> 02:27:23,059
like a thousand dollars in there?

1970
02:27:23,059 --> 02:27:35,350
What's this actual ceremony?

1971
02:27:35,350 --> 02:27:38,420
It's the Star Citizen

1972
02:27:38,420 --> 02:27:40,420
Kickstarter.

1973
02:27:40,420 --> 02:27:44,500
What?

1974
02:27:44,500 --> 02:27:46,500
Oh, God.

1975
02:27:46,500 --> 02:27:53,219
Alright, it's my turn.

1976
02:27:53,219 --> 02:27:57,190
I don't have any money.

1977
02:27:57,190 --> 02:28:04,809
Was this like Ebenezer

1978
02:28:04,809 --> 02:28:09,540
Scrooge?

1979
02:28:09,540 --> 02:28:11,540
He's about to see the growth of Christmas present.

1980
02:28:17,540 --> 02:28:19,540
Wait, what's this?

1981
02:28:32,360 --> 02:28:34,360
Oh, no.

1982
02:28:48,379 --> 02:28:50,620
Okay.

1983
02:28:50,620 --> 02:28:52,620
Well, the Phoenix

1984
02:28:52,620 --> 02:28:56,010
effigy. Burning effigy

1985
02:28:56,010 --> 02:28:58,010
sounds like an accident waiting to happen.

1986
02:28:58,010 --> 02:29:11,370
Let's save it here.

1987
02:29:11,370 --> 02:29:13,370
Somebody mentioned I do have coins.

1988
02:29:13,370 --> 02:29:17,079
No, I have a fish.

1989
02:29:17,079 --> 02:29:19,079
I don't have very much money.

1990
02:29:19,079 --> 02:29:21,639
But will I come from

1991
02:29:21,639 --> 02:29:24,260
this is worth

1992
02:29:24,260 --> 02:29:26,260
gold?

1993
02:29:26,260 --> 02:29:30,489
Thank you.

1994
02:29:30,489 --> 02:29:35,139
I want it back.

1995
02:29:35,139 --> 02:29:43,899
I want it back.

1996
02:29:43,899 --> 02:29:47,670
Alright, let's go.

1997
02:29:47,670 --> 02:29:49,670
Escape.

1998
02:29:49,670 --> 02:29:52,870
Locate the escape door hydraulics.

1999
02:29:52,870 --> 02:29:54,870
I'm definitely not allowed back here.

2000
02:29:59,559 --> 02:30:03,079
Tokens.

2001
02:30:03,079 --> 02:30:09,290
How many do I need? Can I give this guy a token?

2002
02:30:09,290 --> 02:30:17,290
I want to be like the rich asshole

2003
02:30:17,290 --> 02:30:19,290
that's all the way in the back.

2004
02:30:19,290 --> 02:30:21,290
That doesn't give a shit.

2005
02:30:21,290 --> 02:30:23,290
Everyone's throwing cash up there. They want all the claps.

2006
02:30:23,290 --> 02:30:25,290
I'm the guy at the auction.

2007
02:30:25,290 --> 02:30:27,290
That just raises

2008
02:30:27,290 --> 02:30:29,290
up like 50 million dollars. He doesn't

2009
02:30:29,290 --> 02:30:31,290
want any fanfare.

2010
02:30:31,290 --> 02:30:33,290
Who cares? There's 20 million.

2011
02:30:52,170 --> 02:30:56,649
I need that coin.

2012
02:31:00,649 --> 02:31:05,319
I think your fish is done.

2013
02:31:11,379 --> 02:31:13,379
This is a secret elevator.

2014
02:31:16,780 --> 02:31:19,459
How do I get out of this?

2015
02:31:19,459 --> 02:31:26,379
How do I go down?

2016
02:31:52,819 --> 02:31:57,180
Hey, close that.

2017
02:31:57,180 --> 02:32:00,180
Jesse Pinkman.

2018
02:32:00,180 --> 02:32:08,870
Alright, I still have that coin, right?

2019
02:32:08,870 --> 02:32:13,219
No. I still have the fish.

2020
02:32:13,219 --> 02:32:15,399
Alright, we went back to when I had the fish still.

2021
02:32:15,399 --> 02:32:17,399
Alright, we're good.

2022
02:32:17,399 --> 02:32:24,250
So I gotta get back there.

2023
02:32:24,250 --> 02:32:26,250
Alright, locate the escape door.

2024
02:32:26,250 --> 02:32:29,260
Here's the token detailed

2025
02:32:29,260 --> 02:32:31,260
with a relief of the Ark Society

2026
02:32:31,260 --> 02:32:33,260
insignia. Looks significant. Yes, I need it for the door.

2027
02:32:35,260 --> 02:32:40,180
This dude over here.

2028
02:32:40,180 --> 02:32:42,680
Is anyone going to

2029
02:32:42,680 --> 02:32:45,940
stop me from doing this?

2030
02:32:45,940 --> 02:32:47,940
Stop me from doing this?

2031
02:32:47,940 --> 02:32:50,569
Okay, this guy. I'm going to electrocute this guy.

2032
02:32:50,569 --> 02:32:52,569
That's very, very, very certain.

2033
02:32:52,569 --> 02:32:59,030
Like, look.

2034
02:32:59,030 --> 02:33:01,780
I need a screwdriver to do this.

2035
02:33:07,270 --> 02:33:09,270
Alright, well, is there anywhere I can go from here?

2036
02:33:09,270 --> 02:33:13,049
Yes, I'm currently trespassing,

2037
02:33:13,049 --> 02:33:15,049
but I can climb through this window.

2038
02:33:15,049 --> 02:33:18,120
Let me get some tools.

2039
02:33:18,120 --> 02:33:23,479
A wrench. Alright, we're getting to like

2040
02:33:23,479 --> 02:33:25,479
the weird creepy section now.

2041
02:33:25,479 --> 02:33:28,940
Turn on this case.

2042
02:33:28,940 --> 02:33:31,370
It's over here.

2043
02:33:31,370 --> 02:33:36,489
I'm in the crypt?

2044
02:33:36,489 --> 02:33:43,129
Actually, this is good.

2045
02:33:43,129 --> 02:33:45,129
This guy comes over here and I'm going to out fish him.

2046
02:33:45,129 --> 02:33:53,129
Ooh, coins.

2047
02:33:53,129 --> 02:34:00,170
I'm going to go up the stairs.

2048
02:34:00,170 --> 02:34:02,170
I need an outfit though before I do anything else.

2049
02:34:02,170 --> 02:34:04,170
Don't kill him.

2050
02:34:04,170 --> 02:34:09,290
I have an alt here.

2051
02:34:09,290 --> 02:34:12,040
Is it just the one guy? It is.

2052
02:34:12,040 --> 02:34:16,200
Okay, why don't we make too much noise?

2053
02:34:16,200 --> 02:34:27,719
I should be able to get him both.

2054
02:34:34,219 --> 02:34:36,219
Well, there's always a period of adjustment

2055
02:34:36,219 --> 02:34:38,219
when you get a new job, I suppose.

2056
02:34:38,219 --> 02:34:40,219
This is like eavesdropping.

2057
02:34:40,219 --> 02:34:42,219
The point is to keep your eyes on the money.

2058
02:34:42,219 --> 02:34:44,219
This job pays ten times more

2059
02:34:44,219 --> 02:34:46,219
than what the Russian mob pays

2060
02:34:46,219 --> 02:34:48,219
and it's a lot more cleaner.

2061
02:34:48,219 --> 02:34:50,219
I wonder how this guy moves.

2062
02:34:50,219 --> 02:34:52,219
That was an interesting pose.

2063
02:34:52,219 --> 02:34:54,219
I can't dump him?

2064
02:34:54,219 --> 02:34:56,219
Okay, we're good.

2065
02:34:56,219 --> 02:35:00,760
Man.

2066
02:35:00,760 --> 02:35:14,010
I'm going to try and get him.

2067
02:35:14,010 --> 02:35:26,170
I'm going to try and get him.

2068
02:35:26,170 --> 02:35:34,469
Okay, we're good.

2069
02:35:34,469 --> 02:35:36,469
Man, this place is killing my computer.

2070
02:35:36,469 --> 02:35:46,520
Can I put him in a sarcophagus?

2071
02:35:46,520 --> 02:35:56,120
He can go in here.

2072
02:35:56,120 --> 02:36:00,659
Turn on V-Sync.

2073
02:36:00,659 --> 02:36:02,659
V-Sync makes my computer have input lag.

2074
02:36:02,659 --> 02:36:11,479
Look at the music.

2075
02:36:11,479 --> 02:36:13,479
Alright, so now I can try and go back

2076
02:36:13,479 --> 02:36:15,479
to where I was in that other area.

2077
02:36:15,479 --> 02:36:17,479
Alright, I might have to because

2078
02:36:17,479 --> 02:36:23,750
this is going to be impossible.

2079
02:36:23,750 --> 02:36:25,750
I don't think it's going to help but I'll give it a try.

2080
02:36:25,750 --> 02:36:34,840
Usually I get bad input lag

2081
02:36:34,840 --> 02:36:45,850
when I have V-Sync turned on.

2082
02:36:45,850 --> 02:36:47,850
Alright, so here we go.

2083
02:36:47,850 --> 02:36:49,850
Locate the escape door hydraulics.

2084
02:36:49,850 --> 02:36:53,239
Safety protocol.

2085
02:36:53,239 --> 02:36:55,420
Sabotage the hydraulics.

2086
02:36:55,420 --> 02:36:58,489
I need a wrench.

2087
02:36:58,489 --> 02:37:00,489
Which I have but

2088
02:37:00,489 --> 02:37:02,729
this is going to make a lot of noise.

2089
02:37:02,729 --> 02:37:04,729
The cage beneath the giant effigy

2090
02:37:04,729 --> 02:37:06,729
in the courtyard features a hidden escape door

2091
02:37:06,729 --> 02:37:08,729
but according to the safety report, the hydraulic locking mechanism

2092
02:37:08,729 --> 02:37:10,729
is disturbingly sensitive.

2093
02:37:10,729 --> 02:37:12,729
Even a slight drop in pressure could

2094
02:37:12,729 --> 02:37:14,729
jam the lock and effectively trap the

2095
02:37:14,729 --> 02:37:17,540
occupant inside the cage.

2096
02:37:17,540 --> 02:37:32,200
Okay.

2097
02:37:32,200 --> 02:37:35,379
Sabotaged.

2098
02:37:35,379 --> 02:37:37,379
Locate the master of ceremonies.

2099
02:37:37,379 --> 02:37:45,450
He's up.

2100
02:37:45,450 --> 02:37:47,450
Oh, I can go up here.

2101
02:37:47,450 --> 02:37:49,690
Definitely I can go up this ladder.

2102
02:37:49,690 --> 02:37:51,930
Nice. Sick.

2103
02:37:51,930 --> 02:37:53,930
Sick. Nice kid.

2104
02:37:53,930 --> 02:38:02,180
Sick kid. Nice kid.

2105
02:38:02,180 --> 02:38:04,940
Oh dear.

2106
02:38:29,180 --> 02:38:36,709
Don't do that.

2107
02:38:36,709 --> 02:38:40,170
Watch out.

2108
02:38:40,170 --> 02:38:52,260
So, oh, okay.

2109
02:38:52,260 --> 02:39:04,489
Can't really go that way.

2110
02:39:04,489 --> 02:39:07,239
Everyone falls for the ladder.

2111
02:39:07,239 --> 02:39:09,239
Literally everyone. Really?

2112
02:39:09,239 --> 02:39:11,799
I mean, it just seems

2113
02:39:11,799 --> 02:39:13,799
so easy, doesn't it?

2114
02:39:13,799 --> 02:39:19,500
It just looks like it's so convenient

2115
02:39:19,500 --> 02:39:21,500
that it's too good to be true.

2116
02:39:21,500 --> 02:39:28,409
I feel like I still could do it though.

2117
02:39:28,409 --> 02:39:32,120
I just have to wait until this guy's not turning around.

2118
02:39:32,120 --> 02:39:40,889
Yeah, that's the problem. Okay.

2119
02:39:40,889 --> 02:39:42,889
Okay, so now I gotta go from here, back here.

2120
02:39:42,889 --> 02:39:49,670
I mean, this...

2121
02:39:49,670 --> 02:39:51,670
I could drop that, but that's too risky.

2122
02:39:51,670 --> 02:39:53,670
He's in here.

2123
02:39:53,670 --> 02:39:57,190
Two guys. I don't have any keys.

2124
02:39:57,190 --> 02:40:03,079
There he is. Found him.

2125
02:40:15,540 --> 02:40:17,540
Okay, well, he's the only one that can see through.

2126
02:40:17,540 --> 02:40:19,780
What do we got? Okay, we got...

2127
02:40:21,780 --> 02:40:23,780
Master of Ceremonies schedule.

2128
02:40:26,860 --> 02:40:28,860
Okay.

2129
02:40:28,860 --> 02:40:30,860
A moment to moment schedule for the FG ceremony.

2130
02:40:30,860 --> 02:40:32,860
The Master of Ceremonies appears on stage.

2131
02:40:32,860 --> 02:40:34,860
He descends to the money pit.

2132
02:40:34,860 --> 02:40:36,860
He makes a short statement and lights the money on fire.

2133
02:40:36,860 --> 02:40:39,159
The Master summons Zoe Washington on stage.

2134
02:40:39,159 --> 02:40:41,159
Zoe makes a speech

2135
02:40:41,159 --> 02:40:43,159
whereupon she enters the cage beneath the effigy.

2136
02:40:43,159 --> 02:40:45,159
The Master takes the stage

2137
02:40:45,159 --> 02:40:47,159
and lights the effigy on fire.

2138
02:40:47,159 --> 02:40:49,159
Zoe slips out the back door before the structure

2139
02:40:49,159 --> 02:40:51,850
is engulfed in flames.

2140
02:40:55,850 --> 02:40:59,430
I don't think I have poison.

2141
02:41:04,299 --> 02:41:12,600
What else do I got here?

2142
02:41:12,600 --> 02:41:16,889
Coin.

2143
02:41:16,889 --> 02:41:19,829
Where's it gonna go?

2144
02:41:19,829 --> 02:41:21,829
I got guard here.

2145
02:41:21,829 --> 02:41:24,649
I got music box.

2146
02:41:24,649 --> 02:41:39,049
And...

2147
02:41:39,049 --> 02:41:43,530
Nobody cares about this?

2148
02:41:43,530 --> 02:41:47,690
You're the only one that's gonna look at this distraction?

2149
02:41:47,690 --> 02:41:49,690
No, that's not how this is gonna go down.

2150
02:42:23,319 --> 02:42:26,139
And he got the coin too.

2151
02:42:26,139 --> 02:42:29,209
Ha! Did that not hit anybody?

2152
02:42:31,510 --> 02:42:34,389
That's just about enough of this.

2153
02:42:34,389 --> 02:42:50,010
Did he open the door?

2154
02:42:50,010 --> 02:42:52,010
Oh!

2155
02:42:52,010 --> 02:42:57,129
Boomerang!

2156
02:42:57,129 --> 02:42:59,129
I got the boomerang, but it didn't matter.

2157
02:43:28,149 --> 02:43:30,149
Fuck me. Did I really not save it?

2158
02:43:30,149 --> 02:43:50,809
What happened?

2159
02:43:50,809 --> 02:43:52,809
I dropped the chandelier

2160
02:43:52,809 --> 02:43:55,049
and it didn't hit anybody.

2161
02:43:55,049 --> 02:43:57,049
It went right between them both.

2162
02:43:57,049 --> 02:43:59,049
In a perfect spot.

2163
02:43:59,049 --> 02:44:01,799
And then I lost my mind

2164
02:44:01,799 --> 02:44:03,799
and started throwing shit at people.

2165
02:44:03,799 --> 02:44:05,799
And then somebody was found and I unloaded a clip.

2166
02:44:05,799 --> 02:44:35,370
Alright, here we go.

2167
02:44:35,370 --> 02:44:38,250
Let's try this again.

2168
02:44:38,250 --> 02:44:42,219
Save it here.

2169
02:44:42,219 --> 02:44:44,780
One, two, three.

2170
02:44:56,760 --> 02:44:58,760
Alright.

2171
02:44:58,760 --> 02:45:04,069
Go examine somebody.

2172
02:45:04,069 --> 02:45:19,299
So this is not gonna kill him.

2173
02:45:19,299 --> 02:45:21,299
I have to wait until he turns it off and then leaves.

2174
02:45:42,219 --> 02:45:44,219
Close it!

2175
02:45:44,219 --> 02:45:48,059
Close it!

2176
02:45:48,059 --> 02:45:50,059
Same exact scenario.

2177
02:45:50,059 --> 02:45:52,059
Just did it.

2178
02:45:52,059 --> 02:45:56,219
The same scenario.

2179
02:45:56,219 --> 02:45:59,989
Give me his stuff.

2180
02:45:59,989 --> 02:46:04,090
I can't even...

2181
02:46:04,090 --> 02:46:09,139
Get over here.

2182
02:46:09,139 --> 02:46:14,329
I can't believe it.

2183
02:46:14,329 --> 02:46:18,739
I can't hide you here.

2184
02:46:18,739 --> 02:46:20,739
The only difference is he went the other direction.

2185
02:46:20,739 --> 02:46:25,479
Oh my god.

2186
02:46:25,479 --> 02:46:27,479
Why is my computer hate this level so much?

2187
02:46:43,979 --> 02:46:50,760
Don't let me forget that coin.

2188
02:46:50,760 --> 02:46:57,540
Oh, that's full.

2189
02:46:57,540 --> 02:46:59,540
Drop the gun.

2190
02:46:59,540 --> 02:47:01,540
The master of ceremonies with the fucking machine gun.

2191
02:47:01,540 --> 02:47:09,079
Give me the coin.

2192
02:47:09,079 --> 02:47:14,329
Was there one on the ground here too or just that one?

2193
02:47:14,329 --> 02:47:16,329
Okay. Gun.

2194
02:47:16,329 --> 02:47:18,700
Drop it.

2195
02:47:18,700 --> 02:47:21,129
Drop it.

2196
02:47:21,129 --> 02:47:23,129
All I have is the coins.

2197
02:47:23,129 --> 02:47:26,010
As a fish illegal.

2198
02:47:26,010 --> 02:47:28,010
They're not gonna care. They're gonna think I'm a weird person.

2199
02:47:28,010 --> 02:47:40,229
That's it.

2200
02:47:40,229 --> 02:47:42,229
I already know this.

2201
02:47:42,229 --> 02:47:44,229
I can stuff this one in my pants.

2202
02:47:44,229 --> 02:47:46,229
So we got it. I got fish.

2203
02:47:46,229 --> 02:47:48,229
Two coins.

2204
02:47:48,229 --> 02:47:50,229
Make sure the fish is what's currently equipped.

2205
02:47:50,229 --> 02:47:57,590
Save it. It's time to do it. Let's do it.

2206
02:47:57,590 --> 02:48:00,600
All right. Now the ceremony's down here.

2207
02:48:00,600 --> 02:48:02,899
They all can see through this disguise.

2208
02:48:02,899 --> 02:48:04,899
And here goes Doctor Strange.

2209
02:48:04,899 --> 02:48:11,239
Okay, Dad.

2210
02:48:11,239 --> 02:48:13,239
You accidentally ordered the giant fish.

2211
02:48:13,239 --> 02:48:16,059
I'm sorry.

2212
02:48:16,059 --> 02:48:23,610
I'm sorry.

2213
02:48:23,610 --> 02:48:26,809
I'm sorry.

2214
02:48:26,809 --> 02:48:28,809
I'm sorry, Dad.

2215
02:48:28,809 --> 02:48:30,809
You accidentally ordered the children's size costume on Amazon.

2216
02:48:30,809 --> 02:48:32,809
You didn't want to send it back.

2217
02:48:32,809 --> 02:48:40,040
I get it.

2218
02:48:40,040 --> 02:48:43,180
Master of ceremonies.

2219
02:48:43,180 --> 02:48:46,120
Begin.

2220
02:48:52,059 --> 02:48:59,030
Do I have anything to say?

2221
02:48:59,030 --> 02:49:16,500
No speech or anything?

2222
02:49:16,500 --> 02:49:20,280
Okay.

2223
02:49:24,280 --> 02:49:26,280
I did this earlier and everybody was mad at me.

2224
02:49:26,280 --> 02:49:28,280
Just having a dumb shitty costume on.

2225
02:49:28,280 --> 02:49:30,280
It's cool.

2226
02:49:30,280 --> 02:49:40,840
I don't have time for this.

2227
02:49:40,840 --> 02:49:48,649
This is what Jerma does to his bits and

2228
02:49:48,649 --> 02:49:52,620
cheers.

2229
02:49:52,620 --> 02:49:54,620
All right. There she is.

2230
02:49:54,620 --> 02:50:01,209
She's going around.

2231
02:50:01,209 --> 02:50:03,770
We're going to save it here.

2232
02:50:03,770 --> 02:50:06,010
Because I can't be trusted.

2233
02:50:06,010 --> 02:50:14,780
I already know this.

2234
02:50:14,780 --> 02:50:20,200
Cook fish.

2235
02:50:27,379 --> 02:50:29,379
That guy was going to investigate.

2236
02:50:29,379 --> 02:50:31,379
What was that sound?

2237
02:50:31,379 --> 02:50:36,950
Ceremony.

2238
02:50:36,950 --> 02:50:40,409
Summon Zoe Washington.

2239
02:50:40,409 --> 02:50:48,860
Zoe Washington.

2240
02:50:48,860 --> 02:50:51,610
The Arc Society

2241
02:50:51,610 --> 02:50:53,610
recognizes you as

2242
02:50:53,610 --> 02:50:55,610
our founder's rightful

2243
02:50:55,610 --> 02:50:57,610
successor.

2244
02:50:57,610 --> 02:50:59,610
Our inspiration.

2245
02:50:59,610 --> 02:51:01,610
Our guiding light.

2246
02:51:01,610 --> 02:51:03,610
The custodian of our future.

2247
02:51:03,610 --> 02:51:05,610
When you were at my side?

2248
02:51:05,610 --> 02:51:07,610
Excellent work, 47.

2249
02:51:07,610 --> 02:51:10,229
Enjoy the spotlight.

2250
02:51:10,229 --> 02:51:12,229
Patrons of the Arc Society.

2251
02:51:12,229 --> 02:51:14,229
You are part of a select

2252
02:51:14,229 --> 02:51:16,229
chosen few.

2253
02:51:16,229 --> 02:51:18,229
Our founder, Janus, showed us

2254
02:51:18,229 --> 02:51:20,229
how to survive. But survival is

2255
02:51:20,229 --> 02:51:22,229
not enough. We must live

2256
02:51:22,229 --> 02:51:24,229
and we must soar.

2257
02:51:24,229 --> 02:51:26,229
The Arc Society must not only commit

2258
02:51:26,229 --> 02:51:28,229
itself to survival, but to progress.

2259
02:51:28,229 --> 02:51:30,229
Be it our next home in the stars

2260
02:51:30,229 --> 02:51:32,229
or the next step in human evolution.

2261
02:51:32,229 --> 02:51:34,229
There's a giant shot down here.

2262
02:51:34,229 --> 02:51:36,229
This is the eternal purpose of the elite.

2263
02:51:36,229 --> 02:51:38,229
Not just to lead,

2264
02:51:38,229 --> 02:51:40,229
but to lead from the front.

2265
02:51:40,229 --> 02:51:42,229
She sounds so happy.

2266
02:51:42,229 --> 02:51:44,229
When mankind

2267
02:51:44,229 --> 02:51:46,229
retreats once more into caves

2268
02:51:46,229 --> 02:51:48,229
of superstition, we will keep

2269
02:51:48,229 --> 02:51:50,229
the fire alight.

2270
02:51:50,229 --> 02:51:52,229
We will be the torch bearers, the trail

2271
02:51:52,229 --> 02:51:54,229
blazers and pioneers.

2272
02:51:54,229 --> 02:51:56,229
Do not feel guilty for your

2273
02:51:56,229 --> 02:51:58,229
privilege.

2274
02:51:58,229 --> 02:52:00,229
Be fearless.

2275
02:52:00,229 --> 02:52:02,229
For the future

2276
02:52:02,229 --> 02:52:04,229
is ours to shake.

2277
02:52:04,229 --> 02:52:08,649
Alright, get in.

2278
02:52:08,649 --> 02:52:34,950
Hello, sir.

2279
02:52:34,950 --> 02:52:38,020
Look at you, Fenneker. All dressed

2280
02:52:38,020 --> 02:52:40,389
to kill. Now let's do this thing.

2281
02:52:40,389 --> 02:52:54,200
Light her up.

2282
02:52:54,200 --> 02:52:56,200
As the world burns,

2283
02:52:56,200 --> 02:52:58,200
we rise

2284
02:52:58,200 --> 02:53:00,200
from its ashes.

2285
02:53:00,200 --> 02:53:02,200
Not just to survive,

2286
02:53:02,200 --> 02:53:26,260
but to live.

2287
02:53:26,260 --> 02:53:28,260
One target down. Nice work,

2288
02:53:28,260 --> 02:53:30,260
Felicity. Next up,

2289
02:53:30,260 --> 02:53:32,260
Sophia Washington.

2290
02:53:32,260 --> 02:53:48,139
I tried to save her!

2291
02:53:48,139 --> 02:53:53,559
Oh, fuck. This is why I can't be trusted.

2292
02:53:53,559 --> 02:53:57,590
Zoe Washington.

2293
02:53:57,590 --> 02:53:59,959
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

2294
02:53:59,959 --> 02:54:01,959
I thought I had to save you earlier.

2295
02:54:03,959 --> 02:54:05,959
We have to listen to this speech again.

2296
02:54:05,959 --> 02:54:07,959
But I'll be up there and ready.

2297
02:54:07,959 --> 02:54:09,959
The guiding light.

2298
02:54:09,959 --> 02:54:11,959
The custodian of our

2299
02:54:11,959 --> 02:54:14,579
future.

2300
02:54:14,579 --> 02:54:16,579
Excellent work, 47. Enjoy the spotlight.

2301
02:54:16,579 --> 02:54:19,459
Patrons of the

2302
02:54:19,459 --> 02:54:25,399
Arc de Triomphe.

2303
02:54:25,399 --> 02:54:27,399
James showed us how to survive.

2304
02:54:27,399 --> 02:54:29,399
But survival is not enough.

2305
02:54:29,399 --> 02:54:31,399
We must live, and we must

2306
02:54:31,399 --> 02:54:33,399
soar. The Arc Society

2307
02:54:33,399 --> 02:54:35,399
is not only committed itself to survival,

2308
02:54:35,399 --> 02:54:37,399
but to progress. Be it our

2309
02:54:37,399 --> 02:54:39,399
next home in the stars, or the next

2310
02:54:39,399 --> 02:54:41,399
step in human evolution.

2311
02:54:41,399 --> 02:54:44,020
Is the eternal purpose

2312
02:54:44,020 --> 02:54:46,020
of the elite.

2313
02:54:46,020 --> 02:54:48,020
I'm just her son.

2314
02:54:48,020 --> 02:54:50,520
Time comes, and all

2315
02:54:50,520 --> 02:54:52,520
comes tumbling down.

2316
02:54:52,520 --> 02:54:54,520
Don't mind little John.

2317
02:54:54,520 --> 02:54:56,520
Little Johnny.

2318
02:54:56,520 --> 02:54:58,520
We will keep the fire alight.

2319
02:54:58,520 --> 02:55:00,520
He has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

2320
02:55:02,520 --> 02:55:04,520
Do not feel guilty

2321
02:55:04,520 --> 02:55:06,520
for your privilege. Be proud.

2322
02:55:06,520 --> 02:55:08,520
Be fearless.

2323
02:55:08,520 --> 02:55:10,520
For the future is ours

2324
02:55:10,520 --> 02:55:13,139
to shape.

2325
02:55:13,139 --> 02:55:15,139
Look at you, Fenager.

2326
02:55:15,139 --> 02:55:17,139
Now let's do this thing.

2327
02:55:17,139 --> 02:55:21,879
Light her up.

2328
02:55:21,879 --> 02:55:24,950
Hello.

2329
02:55:24,950 --> 02:55:29,239
As the world burns,

2330
02:55:29,239 --> 02:55:31,239
it's from its ashes.

2331
02:55:31,239 --> 02:55:33,239
Not just to survive,

2332
02:55:33,239 --> 02:55:37,020
but to live.

2333
02:55:37,020 --> 02:55:39,020
No, no, no, no.

2334
02:55:39,020 --> 02:55:57,559
One target down.

2335
02:55:57,559 --> 02:55:59,559
Nice work, 47.

2336
02:55:59,559 --> 02:56:05,190
Next

2337
02:56:05,190 --> 02:56:07,190
step, Sophia Washington.

2338
02:56:07,190 --> 02:56:10,520
Hey, let's imagine

2339
02:56:10,520 --> 02:56:12,520
an invisible barrier between

2340
02:56:12,520 --> 02:56:14,520
me and you that extends out to

2341
02:56:14,520 --> 02:56:16,520
us.

2342
02:56:16,520 --> 02:56:25,659
What do you think it was?

2343
02:56:25,659 --> 02:56:32,569
Do you think it's worth investigating?

2344
02:56:32,569 --> 02:56:35,000
Hey, wait a minute.

2345
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:42,100
Please get out of my face.

2346
02:56:42,100 --> 02:56:54,010
Oh, come on.

2347
02:56:54,010 --> 02:56:56,010
Can you just go see what it was?

2348
02:56:56,010 --> 02:56:58,309
For sure. This concludes

2349
02:56:58,309 --> 02:57:00,309
the performance, ladies and gentlemen.

2350
02:57:00,309 --> 02:57:02,549
No, they're not that

2351
02:57:02,549 --> 02:57:04,549
stupid.

2352
02:57:04,549 --> 02:57:06,549
All right, eliminate Sophia Washington.

2353
02:57:06,549 --> 02:57:08,549
Let's go up there.

2354
02:57:08,549 --> 02:57:10,549
Let's see if we can find some intel.

2355
02:57:10,549 --> 02:57:12,549
Isn't that how it's done?

2356
02:57:12,549 --> 02:57:14,549
That was crazy.

2357
02:57:14,549 --> 02:57:22,680
I almost shat myself.

2358
02:57:22,680 --> 02:57:24,680
I think you are coming on a little too strong.

2359
02:57:24,680 --> 02:57:26,680
I almost shat myself.

2360
02:57:26,680 --> 02:57:32,440
Okay.

2361
02:57:32,440 --> 02:57:34,440
It's time.

2362
02:57:34,440 --> 02:57:36,440
Let's head back down.

2363
02:57:36,440 --> 02:57:38,440
I think we should go up here.

2364
02:57:38,440 --> 02:57:40,440
Okay.

2365
02:57:40,440 --> 02:57:42,440
I think we should go up here.

2366
02:57:42,440 --> 02:57:44,440
Let's head back down.

2367
02:57:44,440 --> 02:57:47,579
I think we should go up here.

2368
02:57:47,579 --> 02:57:52,440
Weird.

2369
02:57:52,440 --> 02:57:54,809
I believe I'm allowed to go up here.

2370
02:57:54,809 --> 02:57:56,809
I'm the master of ceremony.

2371
02:57:56,809 --> 02:58:02,180
Yeah, okay.

2372
02:58:02,180 --> 02:58:05,639
I got three of these.

2373
02:58:05,639 --> 02:58:10,569
What can I do up here?

2374
02:58:10,569 --> 02:58:27,579
Thank you.

2375
02:58:27,579 --> 02:58:29,579
What is this? The MOC.

2376
02:58:29,579 --> 02:58:31,579
The master of comedy.

2377
02:58:31,579 --> 02:58:35,219
That's right.

2378
02:58:35,219 --> 02:58:37,459
So,

2379
02:58:37,459 --> 02:58:39,700
I don't want to kill

2380
02:58:39,700 --> 02:58:41,940
That's it.

2381
02:58:41,940 --> 02:58:43,940
The constant.

2382
02:58:43,940 --> 02:58:45,940
Providence's top controller.

2383
02:58:45,940 --> 02:58:47,940
Everything depends on capturing him alive.

2384
02:58:47,940 --> 02:58:49,940
But this?

2385
02:58:49,940 --> 02:58:51,940
We're really doing this, aren't we?

2386
02:58:51,940 --> 02:58:53,940
That we are. Donations.

2387
02:58:53,940 --> 02:58:55,940
Purchases. Excavations.

2388
02:58:55,940 --> 02:58:57,940
Here comes a poo poo joke.

2389
02:58:57,940 --> 02:58:59,940
No, I'm not doing that.

2390
02:59:06,409 --> 02:59:14,090
Why is this guy talking like Mr.

2391
02:59:14,090 --> 02:59:16,090
Rogers?

2392
02:59:16,090 --> 02:59:18,899
Do you want to know my name?

2393
02:59:27,780 --> 02:59:29,780
No, I'm not going to poo on the stream, guys.

2394
02:59:29,780 --> 02:59:32,790
I'm not going to shit on the stream.

2395
02:59:39,770 --> 02:59:41,770
That's an interesting way to hold that gun.

2396
02:59:41,770 --> 02:59:43,770
Do you think the gun

2397
02:59:43,770 --> 02:59:47,219
is going to shit in your hand?

2398
02:59:47,219 --> 02:59:49,399
Good to see you.

2399
02:59:49,399 --> 02:59:59,450
Okay, we've got to get in here.

2400
02:59:59,450 --> 03:00:01,450
The gallery.

2401
03:00:19,319 --> 03:00:34,229
So.

2402
03:00:34,229 --> 03:00:36,229
It was lost for over 500 years.

2403
03:00:36,229 --> 03:00:38,229
Until Blake Nathaniel unsealed

2404
03:00:38,229 --> 03:00:40,229
the serpent's tomb. Hello, sir.

2405
03:00:40,229 --> 03:00:42,229
Extraordinary. It's a flippy necklace.

2406
03:00:42,229 --> 03:00:44,229
Anyway, the Washington

2407
03:00:44,229 --> 03:00:46,229
twins found it first.

2408
03:00:46,229 --> 03:00:50,700
No.

2409
03:00:50,700 --> 03:00:52,700
That was the only lead on the parties.

2410
03:00:52,700 --> 03:00:59,219
Abort mission.

2411
03:00:59,219 --> 03:01:09,459
Through the glass.

2412
03:01:09,459 --> 03:01:11,639
It was lost for over 500 years.

2413
03:01:11,639 --> 03:01:13,639
Until Blake Nathaniel unsealed

2414
03:01:13,639 --> 03:01:15,639
the serpent's tomb.

2415
03:01:15,639 --> 03:01:17,639
Extraordinary. It's a flippy necklace.

2416
03:01:17,639 --> 03:01:19,639
Anyway, the Washington

2417
03:01:19,639 --> 03:01:21,639
twins found it first.

2418
03:01:21,639 --> 03:01:23,639
The way I hear it, Sophia literally

2419
03:01:23,639 --> 03:01:25,639
has the necklace in her hand.

2420
03:01:25,639 --> 03:01:27,639
When Nathaniel repels from the ceiling,

2421
03:01:27,639 --> 03:01:29,639
triggers this ancient death trap.

2422
03:01:29,639 --> 03:01:31,639
Murder may have ensued, but

2423
03:01:31,639 --> 03:01:33,639
I thought those two

2424
03:01:33,639 --> 03:01:35,639
were lovers.

2425
03:01:35,639 --> 03:01:37,639
On and off.

2426
03:01:37,639 --> 03:01:39,639
Currently way off, which explains the added security.

2427
03:01:39,639 --> 03:01:41,639
I don't follow.

2428
03:01:41,639 --> 03:01:43,639
Think about it. Why the need

2429
03:01:43,639 --> 03:01:45,639
for an alarm system where all

2430
03:01:45,639 --> 03:01:47,639
filthy rich accept?

2431
03:01:47,639 --> 03:01:49,639
Ah, I see.

2432
03:01:49,639 --> 03:01:51,639
Blake thinks Sophia

2433
03:01:51,639 --> 03:01:53,639
might try and steal back the necklace before it's

2434
03:01:53,639 --> 03:01:55,639
sealed in the Ark of the Legacy.

2435
03:01:55,639 --> 03:01:57,639
So, according to its charter,

2436
03:01:57,639 --> 03:01:59,639
the Ark Society collects priceless

2437
03:01:59,639 --> 03:02:01,639
art and historical artifacts in case

2438
03:02:01,639 --> 03:02:03,639
of a global disaster.

2439
03:02:03,639 --> 03:02:05,639
And this year, world famous treasure

2440
03:02:05,639 --> 03:02:07,639
hunter Blake Nathaniel

2441
03:02:07,639 --> 03:02:09,639
has donated an Aztec necklace called

2442
03:02:09,639 --> 03:02:11,639
the Cloud Serpent to the Ark Society's

2443
03:02:11,639 --> 03:02:13,639
growing collection. However,

2444
03:02:13,639 --> 03:02:15,639
Blake fears that Sophia Washington,

2445
03:02:15,639 --> 03:02:17,639
his former lover and

2446
03:02:17,639 --> 03:02:19,639
rival, who has hunted the Cloud Serpent

2447
03:02:19,639 --> 03:02:21,639
for years, will attempt to steal

2448
03:02:21,639 --> 03:02:23,639
it for herself before it goes into storage.

2449
03:02:23,639 --> 03:02:25,639
Hmm.

2450
03:02:25,639 --> 03:02:27,639
Could be just the bait we need.

2451
03:02:27,639 --> 03:02:29,639
What's this one?

2452
03:02:29,639 --> 03:02:31,639
I don't know. I didn't discover it.

2453
03:02:31,639 --> 03:02:35,420
Good grief. No honor among thieves, huh?

2454
03:02:35,420 --> 03:02:37,420
I'll say. Interesting.

2455
03:02:37,420 --> 03:02:39,420
You think?

2456
03:02:39,420 --> 03:02:41,420
Okay. So I need to steal the necklace.

2457
03:02:41,420 --> 03:02:46,540
How on earth am I going to steal this necklace?

2458
03:02:46,540 --> 03:02:48,540
Hmm.

2459
03:02:48,540 --> 03:02:52,569
Alarm sensors.

2460
03:02:52,569 --> 03:02:54,569
You'll need to disable the system to get

2461
03:02:54,569 --> 03:02:56,569
at the necklace, 47.

2462
03:02:56,569 --> 03:03:02,260
I could just pull the fire alarm, right?

2463
03:03:02,260 --> 03:03:06,620
Why don't I just pull the fire alarm?

2464
03:03:06,620 --> 03:03:08,620
There's the fuse box.

2465
03:03:08,620 --> 03:03:10,620
Can I steal? Are these allowed?

2466
03:03:10,620 --> 03:03:25,530
What?

2467
03:03:40,020 --> 03:03:55,829
You have to eat all the eggs.

2468
03:03:55,829 --> 03:04:00,500
Okay. Well, this is...

2469
03:04:00,500 --> 03:04:03,129
It goes up there.

2470
03:04:03,129 --> 03:04:05,129
Do I need to climb this?

2471
03:04:05,129 --> 03:04:07,819
They're going to obviously... I need to turn the

2472
03:04:07,819 --> 03:04:09,819
lights off because they're going to see me do this.

2473
03:04:09,819 --> 03:04:11,819
Hmm. Alarm sensors.

2474
03:04:11,819 --> 03:04:13,819
You'll need to disable the system to get

2475
03:04:13,819 --> 03:04:15,819
at the necklace, 47.

2476
03:04:15,819 --> 03:04:29,000
I didn't... I'm trying to turn off the

2477
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:33,670
lights. I guess it worked.

2478
03:04:33,670 --> 03:04:39,799
Well...

2479
03:04:39,799 --> 03:04:41,799
Hey! This area is off-limits!

2480
03:04:41,799 --> 03:04:43,799
I'm getting help!

2481
03:04:43,799 --> 03:04:46,420
I don't like... Hey!

2482
03:04:46,420 --> 03:04:48,420
Better get your head out of your ass double quick!

2483
03:04:48,420 --> 03:04:50,420
Hey, you! This is a restricted area!

2484
03:04:50,420 --> 03:04:52,790
Hey, wait a minute!

2485
03:04:52,790 --> 03:04:55,350
I'm taking you out of here.

2486
03:04:55,350 --> 03:05:00,409
Follow me.

2487
03:05:00,409 --> 03:05:02,409
I already told you to follow me.

2488
03:05:02,409 --> 03:05:06,569
What's the problem, bozo?

2489
03:05:06,569 --> 03:05:08,940
Hey, you!

2490
03:05:08,940 --> 03:05:12,950
That's going to hurt me!

2491
03:05:12,950 --> 03:05:14,950
Man!

2492
03:05:14,950 --> 03:05:18,600
I got to hack the system!

2493
03:05:18,600 --> 03:05:23,059
Well, alright.

2494
03:05:23,059 --> 03:05:27,219
So there's a shitload of people up there.

2495
03:05:27,219 --> 03:05:33,559
Okay.

2496
03:05:33,559 --> 03:05:35,559
Alright. And they can all see... I've got to get a different disguise.

2497
03:05:35,559 --> 03:05:37,860
It was lost for over

2498
03:05:37,860 --> 03:05:39,860
500 years.

2499
03:05:39,860 --> 03:05:41,860
Actually, I might...

2500
03:05:41,860 --> 03:05:43,860
I might be able to get it.

2501
03:05:43,860 --> 03:05:45,860
Anyway, the Washington

2502
03:05:45,860 --> 03:05:47,860
twins found it first.

2503
03:05:47,860 --> 03:05:49,860
The way I hear it, Sophia literally

2504
03:05:49,860 --> 03:05:51,860
has the necklace in her

2505
03:05:51,860 --> 03:05:53,860
hand. When Nathaniel repels from the ceiling,

2506
03:05:53,860 --> 03:05:55,860
it triggers this ancient death

2507
03:05:55,860 --> 03:05:57,860
trap and, you know, murder

2508
03:05:57,860 --> 03:05:59,860
and mayhem.

2509
03:05:59,860 --> 03:06:08,040
Oh, there's no door up there

2510
03:06:08,040 --> 03:06:10,040
though.

2511
03:06:10,040 --> 03:06:12,040
I think I might be

2512
03:06:12,040 --> 03:06:14,469
able to take him out.

2513
03:06:14,469 --> 03:06:16,469
It's very

2514
03:06:16,469 --> 03:06:18,469
possible. Right now?

2515
03:06:18,469 --> 03:06:20,469
Right now.

2516
03:06:27,159 --> 03:06:31,129
I have to go a different way, then.

2517
03:06:31,129 --> 03:06:41,430
It could have been possible.

2518
03:06:41,430 --> 03:06:43,430
If I had choked him out and ran

2519
03:06:43,430 --> 03:06:45,430
around.

2520
03:06:45,430 --> 03:06:47,430
Yeah, I know.

2521
03:06:47,430 --> 03:06:49,430
Alright, let's go...

2522
03:06:49,430 --> 03:06:51,430
I'm going to go this way.

2523
03:06:51,430 --> 03:06:54,440
Steal the necklace.

2524
03:06:54,440 --> 03:06:57,260
Don't show me the fire axe.

2525
03:06:57,260 --> 03:07:00,649
I'm not picking it up.

2526
03:07:00,649 --> 03:07:02,649
Fuck it, man.

2527
03:07:52,200 --> 03:08:04,870
Oh, I got you.

2528
03:08:04,870 --> 03:08:22,280
I got you, motherfucker. Come here.

2529
03:08:26,889 --> 03:08:33,270
Cool.

2530
03:08:35,270 --> 03:08:37,270
Why are you looking in the...

2531
03:08:37,270 --> 03:08:39,270
Why are you looking in here?

2532
03:08:49,110 --> 03:08:53,319
Are you going to investigate that or what?

2533
03:08:53,319 --> 03:08:57,479
Mistake.

2534
03:08:57,479 --> 03:09:03,180
Oh, god damn it.

2535
03:09:03,180 --> 03:09:05,350
I just have a fish. I have one fish.

2536
03:09:05,350 --> 03:09:19,299
I don't give a fuck.

2537
03:09:19,299 --> 03:09:26,540
Hold on, wait, that's not silenced?

2538
03:09:28,780 --> 03:09:30,780
That's not silenced.

2539
03:09:30,780 --> 03:09:35,770
Well, the guy I need to disguise

2540
03:09:35,770 --> 03:09:39,420
as is currently about to...

2541
03:09:56,020 --> 03:09:58,020
No, why'd you shoot him?

2542
03:09:58,020 --> 03:10:00,020
Why'd you shoot him?

2543
03:10:00,020 --> 03:10:02,020
I was trying to shoot him.

2544
03:10:04,020 --> 03:10:09,450
Oh, it's me.

2545
03:10:09,450 --> 03:10:14,250
This is an elite guard.

2546
03:10:14,250 --> 03:10:17,430
Alright.

2547
03:10:17,430 --> 03:10:19,430
Elite guard.

2548
03:10:19,430 --> 03:10:41,299
I have to dump them all.

2549
03:10:41,299 --> 03:10:43,299
Alright, nice. I'm ready.

2550
03:10:43,299 --> 03:10:52,649
Let's give it a save.

2551
03:10:52,649 --> 03:11:01,799
Right here.

2552
03:11:01,799 --> 03:11:05,319
What the hell?

2553
03:11:05,319 --> 03:11:07,319
Evening, sir.

2554
03:11:07,319 --> 03:11:13,959
Alright.

2555
03:11:19,959 --> 03:11:21,959
I thought that was just supposed to be him.

2556
03:11:21,959 --> 03:11:23,959
It's not him.

2557
03:11:23,959 --> 03:11:27,420
Okay, I need to disguise as

2558
03:11:27,420 --> 03:11:29,420
this person down here.

2559
03:11:29,420 --> 03:11:31,590
They're going up the stairs.

2560
03:11:31,590 --> 03:11:33,590
I'm going to cut you off this way.

2561
03:11:33,590 --> 03:11:38,010
I need that mask.

2562
03:11:38,010 --> 03:11:40,629
It's not going to happen.

2563
03:11:40,629 --> 03:11:42,629
It's just not going to happen.

2564
03:11:42,629 --> 03:11:44,629
In fact, I'm not going to be able to open this door either.

2565
03:11:44,629 --> 03:11:46,629
Unless do I have the key to the door?

2566
03:11:46,629 --> 03:11:50,090
I don't.

2567
03:11:50,090 --> 03:11:52,090
I have to sneak through this guy.

2568
03:11:52,090 --> 03:11:56,569
And then upstairs.

2569
03:11:56,569 --> 03:12:01,620
That guy can see, but it doesn't matter.

2570
03:12:01,620 --> 03:12:03,620
Just opens.

2571
03:12:03,620 --> 03:12:05,620
And then I should be able to get this...

2572
03:12:05,620 --> 03:12:13,930
There they go. Upstairs.

2573
03:12:13,930 --> 03:12:16,299
Anything in here I can do?

2574
03:12:16,299 --> 03:12:18,299
No, I don't need to do that.

2575
03:12:18,299 --> 03:12:20,299
I'm going to get a pause moment here

2576
03:12:20,299 --> 03:12:23,620
because I think my dog needs to go outside

2577
03:12:23,620 --> 03:12:35,190
before we get there.

2578
03:12:43,000 --> 03:12:48,739
When does he end up?

2579
03:12:48,739 --> 03:12:54,940
I'm going to do it too.

2580
03:12:54,940 --> 03:12:58,260
No, what the fuck are you doing?

2581
03:12:58,260 --> 03:13:09,209
I can't move.

2582
03:13:20,340 --> 03:13:29,559
I can't go down.

2583
03:13:29,559 --> 03:13:31,559
I can't drop down here?

2584
03:13:31,559 --> 03:13:38,469
I can't do anything.

2585
03:13:38,469 --> 03:13:40,469
You think that I can move to that ledge and clap?

2586
03:13:40,469 --> 03:13:48,219
What are they dragging him to?

2587
03:13:48,219 --> 03:13:50,219
Yeah, but somebody can see me out here.

2588
03:13:50,219 --> 03:13:55,139
I can't be out here for more than two seconds.

2589
03:13:57,139 --> 03:13:59,139
Oh my god.

2590
03:13:59,139 --> 03:14:01,139
Just slide down.

2591
03:14:01,139 --> 03:14:03,139
Why is it so complicated?

2592
03:14:03,139 --> 03:14:08,139
Where is he taking off?

2593
03:14:08,139 --> 03:14:13,319
I don't even know where the fuck that guy even went.

2594
03:14:13,319 --> 03:14:22,329
Where is he now?

2595
03:14:22,329 --> 03:14:25,659
Is he just gone?

2596
03:14:25,659 --> 03:14:27,659
Did the guy get taken out?

2597
03:14:27,659 --> 03:14:29,659
I got to take the dog out.

2598
03:14:29,659 --> 03:14:55,450
He was sprinting around

2599
03:14:55,450 --> 03:14:58,200
in a circle here.

2600
03:14:58,200 --> 03:15:00,200
He just didn't want to be in the room.

2601
03:15:00,200 --> 03:15:02,379
Alright.

2602
03:15:02,379 --> 03:15:04,379
So the question is,

2603
03:15:04,379 --> 03:15:09,620
did they drag them away?

2604
03:15:09,620 --> 03:15:11,620
I'm not sure I can do this right now.

2605
03:15:11,620 --> 03:15:23,059
I think I have to restart it.

2606
03:15:23,059 --> 03:15:25,750
Where did I save it from here?

2607
03:15:25,750 --> 03:15:28,629
Right here.

2608
03:15:28,629 --> 03:15:30,629
I'm in the same disguise, so this should be fine.

2609
03:15:30,629 --> 03:15:38,059
This time I'm going to push him out

2610
03:15:38,059 --> 03:15:40,059
and I'm just going to go right after him.

2611
03:15:57,450 --> 03:15:59,450
I might be able to take him here.

2612
03:16:04,780 --> 03:16:12,379
I don't know what it is about this level, man.

2613
03:16:12,379 --> 03:16:27,799
It's driving me crazy.

2614
03:16:27,799 --> 03:16:29,799
My CPU is not even doing anything.

2615
03:16:29,799 --> 03:16:35,879
I'm at like 24% CPU usage.

2616
03:16:35,879 --> 03:16:37,879
Why is it doing this?

2617
03:16:37,879 --> 03:16:39,879
I'm sorry.

2618
03:16:39,879 --> 03:16:41,879
I take the dog.

2619
03:16:41,879 --> 03:17:21,879
Can I not do this?

2620
03:17:21,879 --> 03:17:23,879
Is this over now?

2621
03:17:23,879 --> 03:17:26,500
Is this over anyways?

2622
03:17:26,500 --> 03:17:28,500
I can do it.

2623
03:17:28,500 --> 03:17:34,069
Sorry you didn't get to see that.

2624
03:17:34,069 --> 03:18:03,180
My god.

2625
03:18:03,180 --> 03:18:07,020
Does anybody know of a solution here?

2626
03:18:07,020 --> 03:18:10,010
Because my game just does not want to run in here.

2627
03:18:10,010 --> 03:18:12,700
We've turned down the graphics and everything,

2628
03:18:12,700 --> 03:18:18,260
but my CPU is running fine.

2629
03:18:18,260 --> 03:18:20,260
I have a 1080.

2630
03:18:20,260 --> 03:18:23,020
Why is this happening?

2631
03:18:23,020 --> 03:18:26,409
Don't know why.

2632
03:18:26,409 --> 03:18:28,409
I have a shotgun on my back.

2633
03:18:28,409 --> 03:18:40,059
Is it the drivers?

2634
03:18:40,059 --> 03:18:42,059
That actually might be...

2635
03:18:42,059 --> 03:18:45,190
What was this?

2636
03:18:45,190 --> 03:18:47,559
I need his stuff.

2637
03:18:47,559 --> 03:18:49,559
Well you missed it. It was really funny.

2638
03:18:49,559 --> 03:18:51,559
Well it wasn't that funny.

2639
03:18:51,559 --> 03:18:59,479
I dropped it right on his head and nobody noticed.

2640
03:18:59,479 --> 03:19:01,479
Angry text from Sophia.

2641
03:19:01,479 --> 03:19:07,239
To me.

2642
03:19:07,239 --> 03:19:09,670
Where is she though?

2643
03:19:09,670 --> 03:19:14,979
Up there.

2644
03:19:14,979 --> 03:19:27,139
Thank you.

2645
03:19:27,139 --> 03:19:30,659
Cap it at 15 frames a second.

2646
03:19:37,459 --> 03:19:41,559
This is so weird.

2647
03:19:41,559 --> 03:19:43,559
I don't know what it is, but if you're like a billionaire

2648
03:19:43,559 --> 03:19:46,440
or like a trillionaire.

2649
03:19:46,440 --> 03:19:48,440
Why are they all...

2650
03:19:48,440 --> 03:19:50,440
Is it all billionaires at one weird shit?

2651
03:19:52,440 --> 03:19:54,440
Like what is this?

2652
03:19:58,440 --> 03:20:00,870
Like why would you have this?

2653
03:20:00,870 --> 03:20:02,870
What is this for?

2654
03:20:08,870 --> 03:20:10,870
Like what are the screens that just have one image?

2655
03:20:27,020 --> 03:20:29,020
Hello?

2656
03:20:29,020 --> 03:20:31,450
Hi.

2657
03:20:31,450 --> 03:20:33,450
Sophia.

2658
03:20:33,450 --> 03:20:35,450
I almost didn't recognize you without

2659
03:20:35,450 --> 03:20:37,450
a knife in my back.

2660
03:20:37,450 --> 03:20:39,450
I see that now.

2661
03:20:39,450 --> 03:20:41,879
This should be good.

2662
03:20:41,879 --> 03:20:55,299
Follow me.

2663
03:20:55,299 --> 03:20:57,299
Excellent 47.

2664
03:20:57,299 --> 03:20:59,299
Let's give Sophia her heart's desire, shall we?

2665
03:20:59,299 --> 03:21:01,299
You've got one minute.

2666
03:21:01,299 --> 03:21:03,299
I did wrong by you Sophia.

2667
03:21:03,299 --> 03:21:05,299
I see that now.

2668
03:21:05,299 --> 03:21:07,299
And I want to make amends.

2669
03:21:07,299 --> 03:21:09,299
Here, this is rightfully yours.

2670
03:21:09,299 --> 03:21:11,479
Well, well.

2671
03:21:11,479 --> 03:21:13,479
Look who comes crawling back.

2672
03:21:13,479 --> 03:21:15,479
Leave us.

2673
03:21:15,479 --> 03:21:23,100
You know,

2674
03:21:23,100 --> 03:21:25,100
we lost three men because of you.

2675
03:21:25,100 --> 03:21:27,100
Wicus was crushed by a rolling

2676
03:21:27,100 --> 03:21:29,100
boulder.

2677
03:21:29,100 --> 03:21:31,100
We only escape

2678
03:21:31,100 --> 03:21:33,100
the arrows by using one of the local

2679
03:21:33,100 --> 03:21:35,100
guides as a human shield.

2680
03:21:35,100 --> 03:21:41,299
Now this is a nice

2681
03:21:41,299 --> 03:21:43,299
gesture.

2682
03:21:43,299 --> 03:21:45,299
I know.

2683
03:21:45,299 --> 03:21:47,299
May I?

2684
03:21:47,299 --> 03:21:50,180
Money counter.

2685
03:21:50,180 --> 03:21:52,180
You know, I thought about sending the boys after you.

2686
03:21:52,180 --> 03:21:54,180
Grab the necklace and cut your throat

2687
03:21:54,180 --> 03:21:56,180
ear to ear. You probably wonder

2688
03:21:56,180 --> 03:21:58,620
why I didn't. The truth is

2689
03:21:58,620 --> 03:22:00,620
you beat us, Blake. I don't deny

2690
03:22:00,620 --> 03:22:02,620
it. And I can't very well get

2691
03:22:02,620 --> 03:22:14,969
Both targets down.

2692
03:22:14,969 --> 03:22:16,969
Impressive work, 47.

2693
03:22:16,969 --> 03:22:18,969
And now to confront the constant.

2694
03:22:18,969 --> 03:22:20,969
Kill switch.

2695
03:22:20,969 --> 03:22:22,969
Mr. Gray, what's your status?

2696
03:22:22,969 --> 03:22:24,969
I'm at the helicopter, but the place

2697
03:22:24,969 --> 03:22:26,969
is crawling with security.

2698
03:22:26,969 --> 03:22:28,969
47, you better bring the constant to one

2699
03:22:28,969 --> 03:22:30,969
of the boats in the harbor where it's quiet.

2700
03:22:30,969 --> 03:22:32,969
Can I put her in the chair? You can use the kill

2701
03:22:32,969 --> 03:22:36,420
switch to coerce.

2702
03:22:36,420 --> 03:22:38,420
Can I put her in the chair like she's sitting in the chair?

2703
03:22:38,420 --> 03:22:42,010
In the window?

2704
03:22:42,010 --> 03:22:44,010
No, I'm not putting her in the window.

2705
03:22:44,010 --> 03:22:48,229
Does he put the cup in the room?

2706
03:22:48,229 --> 03:22:50,229
Help Lucas Gray extract the optional.

2707
03:22:50,229 --> 03:22:54,520
Talk to the constant.

2708
03:22:54,520 --> 03:23:06,809
He's right here.

2709
03:23:06,809 --> 03:23:08,809
The Washingtons are dead. I have the kill switch.

2710
03:23:08,809 --> 03:23:11,940
What did you say?

2711
03:23:11,940 --> 03:23:13,940
How could you know about that?

2712
03:23:13,940 --> 03:23:15,940
You will head towards the harbor.

2713
03:23:15,940 --> 03:23:17,940
No sudden moves.

2714
03:23:17,940 --> 03:23:19,940
No signs or warnings.

2715
03:23:19,940 --> 03:23:21,940
I will trigger the device if I need to.

2716
03:23:21,940 --> 03:23:23,940
I know you.

2717
03:23:23,940 --> 03:23:25,940
The boy in the picture.

2718
03:23:25,940 --> 03:23:27,940
You have his eyes.

2719
03:23:27,940 --> 03:23:29,940
You're Bynwood's assassin.

2720
03:23:29,940 --> 03:23:37,620
Move.

2721
03:23:37,620 --> 03:23:39,620
Everybody thinks I'm gonna do it.

2722
03:23:39,620 --> 03:23:41,620
But I'm not gonna do it.

2723
03:23:41,620 --> 03:23:43,930
Partners, no more. I take it.

2724
03:23:43,930 --> 03:23:45,930
I had a notion

2725
03:23:45,930 --> 03:23:47,930
Something didn't sit right with my

2726
03:23:47,930 --> 03:23:49,930
I'm not gonna do it.

2727
03:23:49,930 --> 03:23:51,930
You murdered him

2728
03:23:51,930 --> 03:23:56,139
I take it to be

2729
03:23:56,139 --> 03:23:58,139
Not just that. He had it coming.

2730
03:23:58,139 --> 03:24:00,819
No, I can't do it.

2731
03:24:00,819 --> 03:24:02,819
I need to get two stars.

2732
03:24:02,819 --> 03:24:04,819
Such sentiment.

2733
03:24:04,819 --> 03:24:06,819
If I don't get two stars then what the hell?

2734
03:24:06,819 --> 03:24:08,819
The doctor built his serum specifically

2735
03:24:08,819 --> 03:24:10,819
to target the seeds of your emotions.

2736
03:24:10,819 --> 03:24:12,819
Has Ms. Bynwood's

2737
03:24:12,819 --> 03:24:14,819
sense of justice rubbed off on you?

2738
03:24:14,819 --> 03:24:16,819
I wonder.

2739
03:24:16,819 --> 03:24:18,819
You must keep walking.

2740
03:24:18,819 --> 03:24:54,329
That's the original five?

2741
03:24:54,329 --> 03:24:56,329
For what it's worth.

2742
03:24:56,329 --> 03:24:58,329
Janus always found

2743
03:24:58,329 --> 03:25:00,329
Ortmeier's project distasteful

2744
03:25:00,329 --> 03:25:02,329
not to mention inefficient.

2745
03:25:02,329 --> 03:25:04,760
S.

2746
03:25:04,760 --> 03:25:06,760
Sometimes you have to play the hand

2747
03:25:06,760 --> 03:25:08,760
you're dealt.

2748
03:25:08,760 --> 03:25:11,770
What if it doesn't work?

2749
03:25:11,770 --> 03:25:13,770
This is just an elaborate ruse and this doesn't even do anything?

2750
03:25:13,770 --> 03:25:15,770
Look at all these ruse patterns.

2751
03:25:15,770 --> 03:25:25,940
Just test it to see if it works.

2752
03:25:25,940 --> 03:25:30,299
Better test it to make sure.

2753
03:25:30,299 --> 03:25:32,299
Make sure it works.

2754
03:25:32,299 --> 03:25:34,469
Okay.

2755
03:25:34,469 --> 03:25:41,190
I guess we'll make sure it works.

2756
03:25:41,190 --> 03:25:43,500
No. 47.

2757
03:25:43,500 --> 03:25:45,500
That was our only lead on the partners.

2758
03:25:45,500 --> 03:25:47,500
Abort mission.

2759
03:25:47,500 --> 03:25:56,969
Alright, it works.

2760
03:25:56,969 --> 03:25:58,969
He's faking it. He could hear the button click.

2761
03:25:58,969 --> 03:26:02,680
He heard like...

2762
03:26:02,680 --> 03:26:10,739
Let me get that door for you.

2763
03:26:10,739 --> 03:26:12,739
I take it this is not an ICA

2764
03:26:12,739 --> 03:26:14,739
sanctioned operation.

2765
03:26:14,739 --> 03:26:16,739
What exactly does Ms. Bynwood

2766
03:26:16,739 --> 03:26:18,739
plan to achieve by targeting her clients?

2767
03:26:18,739 --> 03:26:20,739
Violating her own code?

2768
03:26:20,739 --> 03:26:22,739
She's doing it.

2769
03:26:22,739 --> 03:26:24,739
For us.

2770
03:26:24,739 --> 03:26:27,370
Us? Or C?

2771
03:26:27,370 --> 03:26:29,370
The penny drops.

2772
03:26:29,370 --> 03:26:32,739
I should have known.

2773
03:26:32,739 --> 03:26:34,739
How does a man leave no trace?

2774
03:26:34,739 --> 03:26:36,920
Did I break my eyebrow?

2775
03:26:36,920 --> 03:26:39,100
Did I?

2776
03:26:39,100 --> 03:26:42,409
Did I?

2777
03:26:42,409 --> 03:26:44,709
Me.

2778
03:26:44,709 --> 03:26:46,950
Or was it Subject 6?

2779
03:26:46,950 --> 03:26:48,950
He died when the Institute...

2780
03:26:48,950 --> 03:26:50,950
Oh shit.

2781
03:26:50,950 --> 03:26:52,950
Oh shit.

2782
03:26:52,950 --> 03:26:54,950
Is it because I ran in front of him and

2783
03:26:54,950 --> 03:27:02,870
opened the door?

2784
03:27:02,870 --> 03:27:04,870
Okay.

2785
03:27:04,870 --> 03:27:22,540
We're almost there.

2786
03:27:22,540 --> 03:27:24,540
I take it this is not an ICA

2787
03:27:24,540 --> 03:27:26,540
sanctioned operation.

2788
03:27:26,540 --> 03:27:28,540
What exactly does Ms. Bynwood

2789
03:27:28,540 --> 03:27:30,540
plan to achieve by targeting her clients?

2790
03:27:30,540 --> 03:27:32,540
Violating her own code?

2791
03:27:32,540 --> 03:27:34,540
She's doing it.

2792
03:27:34,540 --> 03:27:36,540
For us.

2793
03:27:36,540 --> 03:27:38,540
Us? Or C?

2794
03:27:38,540 --> 03:27:41,479
The penny drops.

2795
03:27:41,479 --> 03:27:43,479
The penny drops.

2796
03:27:43,479 --> 03:27:46,489
I should have known.

2797
03:27:46,489 --> 03:27:48,489
How does a man leave no trace?

2798
03:27:48,489 --> 03:27:50,979
By not existing in the first

2799
03:27:50,979 --> 03:27:52,979
place.

2800
03:27:52,979 --> 03:27:54,979
Lucas Gray.

2801
03:27:54,979 --> 03:27:56,979
Or was it Subject 6?

2802
03:27:56,979 --> 03:27:58,979
This guy is my hair.

2803
03:27:58,979 --> 03:28:00,979
Nope.

2804
03:28:00,979 --> 03:28:02,979
I don't have a bald spot on the top of my head. Sorry to disappoint you.

2805
03:28:02,979 --> 03:28:04,979
Unlike you, his rage

2806
03:28:04,979 --> 03:28:07,290
never faded.

2807
03:28:07,290 --> 03:28:09,659
So, now you want the nurse.

2808
03:28:09,659 --> 03:28:11,659
The men behind the curtain

2809
03:28:11,659 --> 03:28:14,149
caused you all this pain.

2810
03:28:14,149 --> 03:28:22,389
Before you go knocking down

2811
03:28:22,389 --> 03:28:25,020
Yes. Hello.

2812
03:28:25,020 --> 03:28:27,020
You see there are more people

2813
03:28:27,020 --> 03:28:29,450
above me.

2814
03:28:29,450 --> 03:28:31,450
It's the water that does it. The first mission did

2815
03:28:31,450 --> 03:28:41,110
the same thing. It's all these

2816
03:28:41,110 --> 03:28:43,110
waves that are doing it for some reason.

2817
03:28:43,110 --> 03:28:46,379
Disable water.

2818
03:28:46,379 --> 03:28:48,379
You can't. I can't turn the water off.

2819
03:28:48,379 --> 03:29:02,579
Yikes.

2820
03:29:02,579 --> 03:29:24,579
Jesus.

2821
03:29:24,579 --> 03:29:27,020
Got him.

2822
03:29:27,020 --> 03:29:29,020
I mean that was

2823
03:29:29,020 --> 03:29:43,719
pretty clean.

2824
03:29:43,719 --> 03:29:45,719
Right?

2825
03:29:45,719 --> 03:29:48,090
Like if I get zero stars

2826
03:29:48,090 --> 03:29:50,090
then I mean

2827
03:29:50,090 --> 03:29:53,030
it has to be all the time that I just keep

2828
03:29:53,030 --> 03:29:55,030
reloading and doing stupid things.

2829
03:29:55,030 --> 03:29:59,450
It was like clean enough to not have

2830
03:29:59,450 --> 03:30:01,450
I mean it's gotta be because I'm

2831
03:30:01,450 --> 03:30:03,450
fucking restarting and throwing people off

2832
03:30:03,450 --> 03:30:30,139
balconies. Plus

2833
03:30:30,139 --> 03:30:32,139
zero. It's cause I'm like killing people

2834
03:30:32,139 --> 03:30:34,629
and shit. It was pretty clean.

2835
03:30:34,629 --> 03:30:36,629
Alright we're going to the chapel. The gatehouse.

2836
03:30:36,629 --> 03:30:38,629
We have this mace now.

2837
03:30:38,629 --> 03:30:44,139
A mace.

2838
03:30:44,139 --> 03:30:46,139
Lethal syringe. Finally unlock the syringe.

2839
03:30:46,139 --> 03:30:49,530
And here are the other options for this

2840
03:30:49,530 --> 03:30:51,530
particular part of the game.

2841
03:30:51,530 --> 03:30:53,530
We're on to the final area of

2842
03:30:53,530 --> 03:30:55,959
Hitman 2. This is the last

2843
03:30:55,959 --> 03:30:57,959
area I believe.

2844
03:30:57,959 --> 03:31:10,250
Final area. Not final mission obviously.

2845
03:31:10,250 --> 03:31:12,250
Cause there are six places.

2846
03:31:12,250 --> 03:31:19,799
Wasn't that the final

2847
03:31:19,799 --> 03:31:22,680
area was it? That was the last

2848
03:31:22,680 --> 03:31:24,680
one. Mr. Edwards

2849
03:31:24,680 --> 03:31:26,680
I still think this is maintenance.

2850
03:31:26,680 --> 03:31:28,680
Oh I thought there was another. I thought there was one more.

2851
03:31:28,680 --> 03:31:30,680
Oh Miss Burnwood.

2852
03:31:30,680 --> 03:31:32,680
What have you done?

2853
03:31:32,680 --> 03:31:34,920
Changing horses

2854
03:31:34,920 --> 03:31:36,920
midstream?

2855
03:31:36,920 --> 03:31:38,920
Truly unprofessional.

2856
03:31:38,920 --> 03:31:41,610
You know what we want.

2857
03:31:41,610 --> 03:31:46,090
Where is the carrot?

2858
03:31:46,090 --> 03:31:48,090
No carrot.

2859
03:31:48,090 --> 03:31:50,090
You're useless to the partners.

2860
03:31:50,090 --> 03:31:52,090
Compromised. Even if we let

2861
03:31:52,090 --> 03:31:54,090
you live you can never return.

2862
03:31:54,090 --> 03:31:56,090
Why die protecting

2863
03:31:56,090 --> 03:31:58,090
them? When I can drag them

2864
03:31:58,090 --> 03:32:00,090
down with me?

2865
03:32:00,090 --> 03:32:02,579
It's a bad hand.

2866
03:32:02,579 --> 03:32:09,819
But it's all you've got.

2867
03:32:09,819 --> 03:32:11,819
Three families.

2868
03:32:11,819 --> 03:32:14,569
That's all it took.

2869
03:32:14,569 --> 03:32:16,569
The Ingrams.

2870
03:32:16,569 --> 03:32:18,569
The Carlyles. The Stuyvesants.

2871
03:32:18,569 --> 03:32:20,569
Three

2872
03:32:20,569 --> 03:32:22,569
dynasties. Secretly

2873
03:32:22,569 --> 03:32:24,569
pooling their resources

2874
03:32:24,569 --> 03:32:26,569
over generations.

2875
03:32:26,569 --> 03:32:28,569
Creating a singularity

2876
03:32:28,569 --> 03:32:30,569
so dense that nothing

2877
03:32:30,569 --> 03:32:32,569
escapes its gravity.

2878
03:32:32,569 --> 03:32:34,569
Never heard of them. Well they've heard

2879
03:32:34,569 --> 03:32:36,569
of you. In fact

2880
03:32:36,569 --> 03:32:38,569
you just became the top of their

2881
03:32:38,569 --> 03:32:40,979
agenda. Go.

2882
03:32:40,979 --> 03:32:44,819
We can't give them time to retaliate.

2883
03:32:44,819 --> 03:32:50,969
Don't take your eyes off him.

2884
03:32:50,969 --> 03:32:55,190
He's gonna get out. Be careful.

2885
03:32:55,190 --> 03:32:57,620
Well here we are again.

2886
03:32:57,620 --> 03:32:59,620
I must admit

2887
03:32:59,620 --> 03:33:01,620
I am disappointed Miss Burnwood.

2888
03:33:01,620 --> 03:33:03,620
I had such

2889
03:33:03,620 --> 03:33:05,620
big plans for you.

2890
03:33:05,620 --> 03:33:07,620
Save it. He's gonna get out. I know the truth

2891
03:33:07,620 --> 03:33:09,620
now. You're outplayed.

2892
03:33:09,620 --> 03:33:11,620
You have nothing left to bargain with.

2893
03:33:11,620 --> 03:33:13,620
You're so certain.

2894
03:33:13,620 --> 03:33:15,620
So sure

2895
03:33:15,620 --> 03:33:17,620
of the people closest to you.

2896
03:33:17,620 --> 03:33:19,620
Was he a bad guy?

2897
03:33:19,620 --> 03:33:21,620
He never

2898
03:33:21,620 --> 03:33:23,620
misses his mark.

2899
03:33:23,620 --> 03:33:26,950
You found a window

2900
03:33:26,950 --> 03:33:28,950
into his past.

2901
03:33:28,950 --> 03:33:33,290
And yet

2902
03:33:33,290 --> 03:33:35,290
something else remains

2903
03:33:35,290 --> 03:33:42,139
hidden. So it was

2904
03:33:42,139 --> 03:33:44,139
me the whole time. A simple truth you learned

2905
03:33:44,139 --> 03:33:46,139
long ago.

2906
03:33:46,139 --> 03:33:50,549
No one, Miss

2907
03:33:50,549 --> 03:33:52,549
Burnwood. I did it.

2908
03:33:52,549 --> 03:33:54,549
Is untouchable.

2909
03:33:54,549 --> 03:33:58,579
I was

2910
03:33:58,579 --> 03:34:30,569
the carrot all along. Oh I did it.

2911
03:34:34,340 --> 03:34:38,180
I don't understand the big reveal

2912
03:34:38,180 --> 03:34:40,180
there. Did we do that in a previous game?

2913
03:34:40,180 --> 03:34:42,180
Was that like Hitman 1?

2914
03:34:42,180 --> 03:34:54,219
Look at all these people that made this great game.

2915
03:34:54,219 --> 03:34:56,219
Alright. Um. Um. Um.

2916
03:34:56,219 --> 03:35:03,899
Next up.

2917
03:35:03,899 --> 03:35:05,899
Re-plan mission. Re-play

2918
03:35:05,899 --> 03:35:08,069
mission. Exit to menu.

2919
03:35:08,069 --> 03:35:11,909
There's a lot of other things to do.

2920
03:35:11,909 --> 03:35:14,219
Okay. Alright.

2921
03:35:14,219 --> 03:35:16,219
Hold on. Exit to menu. Wait a minute. Hold on a second here.

2922
03:35:16,219 --> 03:35:19,219
Wait a minute. Hold on.

2923
03:35:19,219 --> 03:35:29,979
Hold on here. Hold on a minute here.

2924
03:35:29,979 --> 03:35:56,200
What is this? That's the

2925
03:35:56,200 --> 03:35:58,200
DLC. Ah. From Hitman 1.

2926
03:35:58,200 --> 03:36:05,879
What else? Okay. This is sniper

2927
03:36:05,879 --> 03:36:07,879
assassin mode. And then there's also ghost

2928
03:36:07,879 --> 03:36:10,950
mode. I didn't

2929
03:36:10,950 --> 03:36:12,950
even do this. Single player.

2930
03:36:12,950 --> 03:36:17,430
What is this? Oh this is like

2931
03:36:17,430 --> 03:36:20,629
the demo isn't it?

2932
03:36:20,629 --> 03:36:22,629
Welcome to Austria.

2933
03:36:22,629 --> 03:36:24,629
Agent 47. Your targets are Dorian

2934
03:36:24,629 --> 03:36:26,629
Lang, Guillaume Maison

2935
03:36:26,629 --> 03:36:28,629
and Doris Lee. Three remaining

2936
03:36:28,629 --> 03:36:30,629
members of the international gang of thieves

2937
03:36:30,629 --> 03:36:32,629
known as the Yardbirds. The multiplayer is in beta?

2938
03:36:32,629 --> 03:36:34,629
The Yardbirds were famous for the daring

2939
03:36:34,629 --> 03:36:36,629
heists. In particular, one that

2940
03:36:36,629 --> 03:36:38,629
took place against Chamal Casino in Las

2941
03:36:38,629 --> 03:36:40,629
Vegas. I- That's where I live!

2942
03:36:40,629 --> 03:36:42,629
To be the property of organized criminals

2943
03:36:42,629 --> 03:36:44,629
who in turn launched a campaign of violence

2944
03:36:44,629 --> 03:36:46,629
and retaliation in an effort to

2945
03:36:46,629 --> 03:36:48,629
identify the thieves and find

2946
03:36:48,629 --> 03:36:50,629
the money. Feeling the earth burn beneath

2947
03:36:50,629 --> 03:36:52,629
them, the Yardbirds entered into

2948
03:36:52,629 --> 03:36:54,629
a secret agreement. The treasure would

2949
03:36:54,629 --> 03:36:56,629
remain hidden and once the dust settled

2950
03:36:56,629 --> 03:36:58,629
the last remaining member was to

2951
03:36:58,629 --> 03:37:00,629
inherit everything.

2952
03:37:00,629 --> 03:37:02,629
The group retired and all members vanished

2953
03:37:02,629 --> 03:37:04,629
from sight until Calvin Ritter

2954
03:37:04,629 --> 03:37:06,629
the Sparrow was found dead

2955
03:37:06,629 --> 03:37:08,629
on his yacht. But the remaining

2956
03:37:08,629 --> 03:37:10,629
members remained elusive.

2957
03:37:10,629 --> 03:37:12,940
The group never gathers

2958
03:37:12,940 --> 03:37:14,940
in one place but today

2959
03:37:14,940 --> 03:37:16,940
is a special occasion.

2960
03:37:16,940 --> 03:37:18,940
The owl's birthday!

2961
03:37:42,940 --> 03:37:45,559
Alright, eliminate

2962
03:37:45,559 --> 03:37:47,559
everybody. I didn't do this.

2963
03:37:47,559 --> 03:37:54,409
Kill them all.

2964
03:37:54,409 --> 03:37:58,500
Agent and Mastery. Agent 47.

2965
03:37:58,500 --> 03:38:00,500
Sure.

2966
03:38:00,500 --> 03:38:02,500
C...

2967
03:38:02,500 --> 03:38:06,409
Extended mag level 2. Alright,

2968
03:38:06,409 --> 03:38:11,590
level up?

2969
03:38:11,590 --> 03:38:22,219
Let's do it.

2970
03:38:28,219 --> 03:38:30,219
Oh.

2971
03:38:32,219 --> 03:38:34,219
So, is the multiplayer

2972
03:38:34,219 --> 03:38:36,219
like available right now?

2973
03:38:36,219 --> 03:38:38,219
I'll try, I would try it.

2974
03:38:52,219 --> 03:38:54,219
It's Battle Royale.

2975
03:38:54,219 --> 03:38:56,219
No, it is not, is it?

2976
03:39:00,219 --> 03:39:02,219
It's a Battle Royale.

2977
03:39:02,219 --> 03:39:04,219
I don't believe that.

2978
03:39:43,940 --> 03:39:45,940
Alright, let's do it.

2979
03:39:45,940 --> 03:39:50,040
So we got guy in the window,

2980
03:39:50,040 --> 03:39:52,040
people showing up by car.

2981
03:39:52,040 --> 03:40:03,620
Just wait till they all get to the ceremony.

2982
03:40:03,620 --> 03:40:05,620
He's in the car, he's in the window.

2983
03:40:05,620 --> 03:40:13,239
This is the mobile game.

2984
03:40:13,239 --> 03:40:17,590
It's a flash game.

2985
03:40:17,590 --> 03:40:22,010
This was the teaser though,

2986
03:40:22,010 --> 03:40:33,659
wasn't it?

2987
03:40:33,659 --> 03:40:35,659
Wasn't this the precursor to Hitman 2

2988
03:40:35,659 --> 03:40:41,860
releasing? I think I can handle it.

2989
03:40:41,860 --> 03:40:44,549
Once he gets close enough I'll try to take out

2990
03:40:44,549 --> 03:40:49,670
1, 2, 3. Just play

2991
03:40:49,670 --> 03:40:51,670
the stickman sniper game.

2992
03:40:51,670 --> 03:40:53,670
Oh my god, that's a long time ago.

2993
03:40:53,670 --> 03:40:56,360
Alright, where is he?

2994
03:40:58,600 --> 03:41:00,600
The Kingfisher.

2995
03:41:00,600 --> 03:41:02,600
Former Interpol agent and the owner of

2996
03:41:02,600 --> 03:41:10,020
the mansion and its grounds.

2997
03:41:10,020 --> 03:41:12,020
So who is this then?

2998
03:41:12,020 --> 03:41:14,020
That is Doris Lee, aka

2999
03:41:14,020 --> 03:41:16,020
the Goldfinch.

3000
03:41:16,020 --> 03:41:18,020
Former Hollywood stunt woman of Cheyenne descent.

3001
03:41:24,549 --> 03:41:26,549
That is Dorian Lang, the Red Robin.

3002
03:41:26,549 --> 03:41:28,549
Former military engineer

3003
03:41:28,549 --> 03:41:30,549
and father of the bride.

3004
03:41:30,549 --> 03:41:32,549
47, the situation is about

3005
03:41:32,549 --> 03:41:34,549
to become critical. Lang is down.

3006
03:41:34,549 --> 03:41:36,549
Nice work 47.

3007
03:41:36,549 --> 03:41:38,549
Lee has been eliminated.

3008
03:41:38,549 --> 03:41:42,260
Good work 47.

3009
03:41:42,260 --> 03:41:47,829
47, an alarm went off.

3010
03:41:47,829 --> 03:41:49,829
They're evacuating.

3011
03:41:49,829 --> 03:42:07,750
Oh shit, I got a bridesmaid.

3012
03:42:07,750 --> 03:42:09,750
Oh fuck.

3013
03:42:09,750 --> 03:42:11,750
No.

3014
03:42:11,750 --> 03:42:18,149
There they go.

3015
03:42:18,149 --> 03:42:20,649
Nice work 47.

3016
03:43:04,280 --> 03:43:17,979
Nice long jump.

3017
03:43:17,979 --> 03:43:19,979
They're just shooting up here.

3018
03:43:19,979 --> 03:43:25,350
Nobody can hit me. Oh my god,

3019
03:43:25,350 --> 03:43:29,260
this sensitivity. Wait, DPI.

3020
03:43:29,260 --> 03:43:31,430
One, two, three. DPI up.

3021
03:43:31,430 --> 03:44:37,670
Someone's getting away. Someone's getting away.

3022
03:44:37,670 --> 03:45:41,209
Yes.

3023
03:45:41,209 --> 03:45:47,100
Nice work 47.

3024
03:45:47,100 --> 03:46:00,010
That was fun, I guess.

3025
03:46:00,010 --> 03:46:11,530
There's so many ways to do that.

3026
03:46:11,530 --> 03:46:16,010
Now do ghost mode. Yeah, okay.

3027
03:46:16,010 --> 03:46:20,100
Oh my DPI.

3028
03:46:20,100 --> 03:46:22,100
Alright, let's try the multiplayer.

3029
03:46:22,100 --> 03:46:31,879
Let's see what it's like. Ghost mode.

3030
03:46:31,879 --> 03:46:38,309
Okay. Briefing.

3031
03:46:38,309 --> 03:46:40,309
Eliminate targets to gain points

3032
03:46:40,309 --> 03:46:45,430
and beat your opponent. Find opponent.

3033
03:46:45,430 --> 03:46:48,569
Quick match. Game rules.

3034
03:46:48,569 --> 03:46:50,569
I kind of need to know what the hell happens here.

3035
03:47:04,940 --> 03:47:06,940
Are we in the same game?

3036
03:47:06,940 --> 03:47:08,940
The first player with five eliminations

3037
03:47:08,940 --> 03:47:10,940
is the winner. Targets are

3038
03:47:10,940 --> 03:47:12,940
randomly selected every time

3039
03:47:12,940 --> 03:47:14,940
so no duel will be the same.

3040
03:47:14,940 --> 03:47:16,940
Since you start off with no equipment

3041
03:47:16,940 --> 03:47:18,940
you'll need to improvise.

3042
03:47:18,940 --> 03:47:20,940
Find ghost crates and grab

3043
03:47:20,940 --> 03:47:22,940
disguises as you go. Can we see

3044
03:47:22,940 --> 03:47:24,940
each other? If your opponent scores a kill

3045
03:47:24,940 --> 03:47:26,940
you'll have limited time to react.

3046
03:47:26,940 --> 03:47:28,940
Will you risk blowing

3047
03:47:28,940 --> 03:47:30,940
your cover? Be careful.

3048
03:47:30,940 --> 03:47:32,940
A spotted kill does not count.

3049
03:47:32,940 --> 03:47:34,940
Does not count?

3050
03:47:34,940 --> 03:47:36,940
You exist in separate realities.

3051
03:47:36,940 --> 03:47:38,940
So a messy, chaotic

3052
03:47:38,940 --> 03:47:40,940
approach on your end

3053
03:47:40,940 --> 03:47:42,940
does not affect your opponent.

3054
03:47:42,940 --> 03:47:44,940
Quite the contrary. While you're

3055
03:47:44,940 --> 03:47:46,940
busy cleaning up or running for your life

3056
03:47:46,940 --> 03:47:48,940
your opponent is free to advance

3057
03:47:48,940 --> 03:47:50,940
like a ghost. Be cunning,

3058
03:47:50,940 --> 03:47:52,940
be creative, be ruthless.

3059
03:47:52,940 --> 03:47:54,940
Good luck.

3060
03:47:54,940 --> 03:47:56,940
That's kind of unfortunate.

3061
03:47:56,940 --> 03:48:00,899
I guess you kind of have to do something like

3062
03:48:00,899 --> 03:48:02,899
that though. Because

3063
03:48:02,899 --> 03:48:05,719
how would you ever do this?

3064
03:48:05,719 --> 03:48:07,719
Somebody would just throw grenades

3065
03:48:07,719 --> 03:48:12,200
and it would just ruin everything.

3066
03:48:12,200 --> 03:48:14,200
Alright, I'm going up against

3067
03:48:14,200 --> 03:48:31,670
Coca-Cola.

3068
03:48:31,670 --> 03:48:33,670
It would just be a cesspool game mode.

3069
03:48:33,670 --> 03:48:40,010
Yeah, it wouldn't work.

3070
03:48:40,010 --> 03:48:42,010
It'd be fun to do something like

3071
03:48:42,010 --> 03:48:44,010
that Assassin's Creed

3072
03:48:44,010 --> 03:48:46,010
game mode where

3073
03:48:46,010 --> 03:48:48,010
it was a game that I played where you hit around

3074
03:48:48,010 --> 03:48:50,010
and you had to get... Can we actually see each other though?

3075
03:48:52,010 --> 03:48:54,010
I guess we can see each other.

3076
03:48:59,829 --> 03:49:02,139
Don't orcs. Anything can still happen.

3077
03:49:02,139 --> 03:49:18,780
Your opponent is now

3078
03:49:18,780 --> 03:49:27,989
disguised.

3079
03:49:27,989 --> 03:49:56,090
Silent takedown.

3080
03:49:56,090 --> 03:50:03,690
You're following me.

3081
03:50:03,690 --> 03:50:05,690
Why are we the same target?

3082
03:50:13,350 --> 03:50:15,979
I got it before he did.

3083
03:50:15,979 --> 03:50:17,979
What's going on?

3084
03:50:17,979 --> 03:50:22,520
Next target in 10 seconds.

3085
03:50:24,520 --> 03:50:26,520
Hold on. So it's just a race

3086
03:50:26,520 --> 03:50:28,520
to get to the guy?

3087
03:50:28,520 --> 03:50:30,520
Okay, this is way cooler.

3088
03:50:30,520 --> 03:50:32,520
This is not...

3089
03:50:32,520 --> 03:50:36,040
New target. Find

3090
03:50:36,040 --> 03:50:39,620
and eliminate. Good news.

3091
03:50:39,620 --> 03:50:41,620
Your opponent died.

3092
03:50:41,620 --> 03:50:48,280
Your opponent is back

3093
03:50:48,280 --> 03:50:50,280
in the fight.

3094
03:50:50,280 --> 03:50:53,030
Good news.

3095
03:50:53,030 --> 03:51:09,590
Wait, is he upstairs?

3096
03:51:09,590 --> 03:51:21,420
Damn it.

3097
03:51:21,420 --> 03:51:31,079
Good news. Wait, is he down?

3098
03:51:33,079 --> 03:51:42,219
What the fuck?

3099
03:51:42,219 --> 03:51:44,219
Go!

3100
03:51:44,219 --> 03:51:55,739
Go over it!

3101
03:51:55,739 --> 03:52:09,500
Your opponent killed the target.

3102
03:52:09,500 --> 03:52:13,340
Warning. Target

3103
03:52:13,340 --> 03:52:17,299
will be lost in 15 seconds.

3104
03:52:17,299 --> 03:52:19,299
Target lost.

3105
03:52:19,299 --> 03:52:21,299
Oh, okay. I get it.

3106
03:52:21,299 --> 03:52:23,299
I get it. I get it.

3107
03:52:23,299 --> 03:52:25,299
I get it. I understand.

3108
03:52:25,299 --> 03:52:27,299
Wait a minute.

3109
03:52:27,299 --> 03:52:29,299
I understand.

3110
03:52:29,299 --> 03:52:31,299
So it doesn't matter.

3111
03:52:31,299 --> 03:52:33,299
I get it.

3112
03:52:33,299 --> 03:52:35,299
So wait, why did

3113
03:52:35,299 --> 03:52:37,299
Why does he only have one

3114
03:52:37,299 --> 03:52:39,299
point?

3115
03:52:39,299 --> 03:52:41,299
Where's his point?

3116
03:52:41,299 --> 03:52:43,299
I don't get it.

3117
03:52:43,299 --> 03:52:45,860
How come he doesn't have a point right now?

3118
03:52:45,860 --> 03:52:47,860
Because I killed it in time?

3119
03:52:47,860 --> 03:52:54,200
He got noticed too? Okay.

3120
03:52:54,200 --> 03:52:57,780
When does this end?

3121
03:52:57,780 --> 03:53:03,739
Your opponent changed disguise.

3122
03:53:03,739 --> 03:53:15,959
Your opponent changed disguise.

3123
03:53:17,959 --> 03:53:24,360
Where is this dude?

3124
03:53:24,360 --> 03:53:26,360
Is he down?

3125
03:53:26,360 --> 03:53:28,360
He is down.

3126
03:53:28,360 --> 03:53:30,360
He is down. He's in the garage.

3127
03:53:36,360 --> 03:53:38,360
Okay.

3128
03:53:38,360 --> 03:53:40,360
I gotta get down to the garage.

3129
03:53:42,360 --> 03:53:46,260
I gotta go down the stairs.

3130
03:53:46,260 --> 03:53:48,260
Neither one of us can get him

3131
03:53:48,260 --> 03:53:50,260
apparently.

3132
03:54:00,260 --> 03:54:02,260
No!

3133
03:54:04,500 --> 03:54:06,500
Damn it!

3134
03:54:30,149 --> 03:54:32,149
I'm not even changing disguise.

3135
03:54:32,149 --> 03:54:37,780
It has to be a stealth kill.

3136
03:54:37,780 --> 03:54:39,780
That's right.

3137
03:54:39,780 --> 03:54:42,280
Alright. I got the jump on this one.

3138
03:54:42,280 --> 03:54:44,280
He's up there.

3139
03:54:58,260 --> 03:55:00,260
We'll see.

3140
03:55:00,260 --> 03:55:02,260
What's this?

3141
03:55:22,329 --> 03:55:24,329
Target eliminated.

3142
03:55:24,329 --> 03:55:30,790
He's in a bird costume.

3143
03:55:30,790 --> 03:55:35,510
Clean kill.

3144
03:55:35,510 --> 03:55:37,510
Score two to one.

3145
03:55:37,510 --> 03:55:39,510
Wait. Give me that costume.

3146
03:55:39,510 --> 03:55:41,510
Score two to two.

3147
03:55:41,510 --> 03:55:43,510
Two to two?

3148
03:55:43,510 --> 03:55:45,510
Your opponent just picked up additional

3149
03:55:45,510 --> 03:55:47,510
equipment.

3150
03:55:47,510 --> 03:55:49,510
Where did he get the extra point from?

3151
03:55:49,510 --> 03:55:51,510
Three, two, one.

3152
03:55:51,510 --> 03:55:54,329
New target.

3153
03:55:54,329 --> 03:55:56,329
Find and eliminate.

3154
03:55:56,329 --> 03:55:59,340
Pool ball?

3155
03:55:59,340 --> 03:56:04,389
Alright. I got a pool ball.

3156
03:56:04,389 --> 03:56:06,700
What was the extra point?

3157
03:56:06,700 --> 03:56:13,540
I can't go this way.

3158
03:56:13,540 --> 03:56:18,469
Yeah. We both killed the same guy though.

3159
03:56:18,469 --> 03:56:35,940
Let me just disguise. Come on.

3160
03:56:35,940 --> 03:56:38,629
Prime noticed by somebody.

3161
03:56:38,629 --> 03:56:42,729
Who the fuck saw it?

3162
03:56:42,729 --> 03:56:47,399
Oh. Fuck you.

3163
03:56:47,399 --> 03:57:02,420
Oh well.

3164
03:57:02,420 --> 03:57:04,420
I'm still...

3165
03:57:04,420 --> 03:57:06,420
What is happening here?

3166
03:57:06,420 --> 03:57:09,559
Get out of the way.

3167
03:57:09,559 --> 03:57:13,020
What the fuck are you...

3168
03:57:13,020 --> 03:57:15,020
Your opponent just picked up a weapon.

3169
03:57:15,020 --> 03:57:26,790
I can't vault over that.

3170
03:57:26,790 --> 03:57:28,790
Oh my goodness.

3171
03:57:28,790 --> 03:57:30,790
I can't vault over that either.

3172
03:57:30,790 --> 03:57:34,059
I can't unlock that. Shit.

3173
03:57:41,239 --> 03:57:43,239
I gotta go down.

3174
03:57:43,239 --> 03:57:47,909
I gotta go down. I gotta go down. I gotta go down.

3175
03:57:47,909 --> 03:58:02,700
I have no items.

3176
03:58:02,700 --> 03:58:09,219
Snap his neck. Frame rate.

3177
03:58:09,219 --> 03:58:11,219
Why?

3178
03:58:11,219 --> 03:58:25,610
Is there anything in here?

3179
03:58:25,610 --> 03:58:27,610
Score three to two.

3180
03:58:27,610 --> 03:58:29,780
What the fuck is happening?

3181
03:58:29,780 --> 03:58:31,780
What are you talking about?

3182
03:58:31,780 --> 03:58:33,780
All even.

3183
03:58:33,780 --> 03:58:35,780
Move carefully. Five.

3184
03:58:35,780 --> 03:58:37,780
Four. Your opponent

3185
03:58:37,780 --> 03:58:39,780
just picked up additional equipment.

3186
03:58:39,780 --> 03:58:41,780
New target.

3187
03:58:41,780 --> 03:58:43,780
Find and eliminate.

3188
03:58:43,780 --> 03:58:49,739
I'm in the game too?

3189
03:58:49,739 --> 03:58:51,739
He's up. He's this way. Up or...

3190
03:58:51,739 --> 03:59:05,110
I'm secure though.

3191
03:59:05,110 --> 03:59:21,879
I should be fine.

3192
03:59:21,879 --> 03:59:23,879
Your opponent changed disguise.

3193
03:59:23,879 --> 03:59:27,399
Your opponent just

3194
03:59:27,399 --> 03:59:29,399
picked up additional equipment.

3195
03:59:29,399 --> 03:59:38,149
This is where I take the lead.

3196
03:59:38,149 --> 03:59:40,149
Right here. This is where I take the lead.

3197
03:59:40,149 --> 03:59:52,500
Did I not get it?

3198
03:59:52,500 --> 03:59:55,770
Your kill was

3199
03:59:55,770 --> 03:59:57,770
witnessed. Fucking god damn it.

3200
03:59:57,770 --> 03:59:59,770
Let me just repeat some ground rules

3201
03:59:59,770 --> 04:00:01,770
for those of you new...

3202
04:00:01,770 --> 04:00:03,770
What?

3203
04:00:03,770 --> 04:00:05,770
I lost a point for that. I lost...

3204
04:00:05,770 --> 04:00:07,770
Two to three.

3205
04:00:07,770 --> 04:00:09,770
How did he see me do that?

3206
04:00:09,770 --> 04:00:11,770
Five. Four.

3207
04:00:11,770 --> 04:00:13,770
Three. Good news.

3208
04:00:13,770 --> 04:00:15,770
Your opponent died.

3209
04:00:15,770 --> 04:00:17,770
New target. Find

3210
04:00:17,770 --> 04:00:19,770
and eliminate. So that's what happened.

3211
04:00:19,770 --> 04:00:21,770
That's what happened to him.

3212
04:00:21,770 --> 04:00:23,770
Your opponent is back in the fight.

3213
04:00:23,770 --> 04:00:25,770
Oh my fucking god.

3214
04:00:25,770 --> 04:00:27,770
One to three.

3215
04:00:27,770 --> 04:00:32,950
Your opponent changed disguise.

3216
04:00:32,950 --> 04:00:34,950
Just get me out of

3217
04:00:34,950 --> 04:00:41,030
the game already.

3218
04:00:41,030 --> 04:00:43,459
He's gonna win.

3219
04:00:43,459 --> 04:00:45,459
If you kill somebody that's not

3220
04:00:45,459 --> 04:00:47,459
the target you lose a full point.

3221
04:00:47,459 --> 04:00:50,219
That's a rage quit right there.

3222
04:00:50,219 --> 04:00:52,219
Like what the fuck?

3223
04:00:52,219 --> 04:00:54,219
Guy gets behind and the security camera sees

3224
04:00:54,219 --> 04:00:57,420
me. That's why I got compromised.

3225
04:00:57,420 --> 04:01:13,930
That's bullshit.

3226
04:01:13,930 --> 04:01:15,930
Why would you even give this to me?

3227
04:01:15,930 --> 04:01:17,930
How the hell are you supposed to use this without being seen?

3228
04:01:17,930 --> 04:01:31,239
Don't retaliate.

3229
04:01:31,239 --> 04:01:33,239
You'll lose points.

3230
04:01:33,239 --> 04:01:42,780
Back in the fight.

3231
04:01:42,780 --> 04:01:46,870
Careful. Your enemy

3232
04:01:46,870 --> 04:01:52,059
will still recognize you.

3233
04:01:52,059 --> 04:01:54,059
You are losing. Assert yourself.

3234
04:01:54,059 --> 04:01:56,059
I had a chance and then I threw it away.

3235
04:01:56,059 --> 04:01:58,059
Score. One to four.

3236
04:01:58,059 --> 04:02:00,059
Your opponent has almost won.

3237
04:02:00,059 --> 04:02:02,059
Good. I hope he wins.

3238
04:02:02,059 --> 04:02:04,059
I would have won the game too.

3239
04:02:04,059 --> 04:02:06,059
Seven. Six.

3240
04:02:06,059 --> 04:02:08,059
Five. Four.

3241
04:02:08,059 --> 04:02:10,059
Three. Two.

3242
04:02:10,059 --> 04:02:12,549
One.

3243
04:02:12,549 --> 04:02:14,549
New target. Find and

3244
04:02:14,549 --> 04:02:20,180
eliminate.

3245
04:02:20,180 --> 04:02:24,340
Just kill me.

3246
04:02:24,340 --> 04:02:26,709
Just go win.

3247
04:02:26,709 --> 04:02:28,709
Your opponent changed disguise.

3248
04:02:28,709 --> 04:02:34,409
Let me open the door for you.

3249
04:02:34,409 --> 04:02:41,579
I'll go scout it out up here.

3250
04:02:41,579 --> 04:02:43,579
Your opponent just picked up additional

3251
04:02:43,579 --> 04:02:46,520
equipment.

3252
04:02:46,520 --> 04:02:55,909
I hope he uses it well.

3253
04:02:55,909 --> 04:02:57,909
Use some assistance here.

3254
04:02:57,909 --> 04:03:05,659
Your opponent just picked up

3255
04:03:05,659 --> 04:03:07,659
additional equipment.

3256
04:03:07,659 --> 04:03:09,659
I don't see how this works. I have no items.

3257
04:03:09,659 --> 04:03:15,989
I'm not allowed to be in here.

3258
04:03:15,989 --> 04:03:17,989
If it's a camera, I swear to God.

3259
04:03:17,989 --> 04:03:34,040
Knock him off.

3260
04:03:34,040 --> 04:03:36,040
Why would they give you guns like this?

3261
04:03:36,040 --> 04:03:40,840
I want to see what happens if I do this.

3262
04:03:40,840 --> 04:03:42,840
Target eliminated. Your kill was witnessed.

3263
04:03:42,840 --> 04:03:46,729
Target. Score.

3264
04:03:46,729 --> 04:03:48,729
Zero to four.

3265
04:03:48,729 --> 04:03:54,090
Nine. Six.

3266
04:03:54,090 --> 04:03:56,090
Five. Four.

3267
04:03:56,090 --> 04:03:58,090
Three. Two.

3268
04:03:58,090 --> 04:04:00,090
One.

3269
04:04:00,090 --> 04:04:03,100
Target. Score. Zero

3270
04:04:03,100 --> 04:04:05,100
to four.

3271
04:04:05,100 --> 04:04:08,739
You just kill him. He's in there.

3272
04:04:08,739 --> 04:04:10,739
Is there a forfeit button?

3273
04:04:18,360 --> 04:04:23,459
Just exit.

3274
04:04:23,459 --> 04:04:30,500
Congratulations, you won.

3275
04:04:30,500 --> 04:04:32,500
It just quit me out of the whole game.

3276
04:04:32,500 --> 04:04:36,979
It's updating now.

3277
04:04:36,979 --> 04:04:38,979
I have an update to download.

3278
04:04:38,979 --> 04:04:44,040
Why is this the second time this has done this?

3279
04:04:44,040 --> 04:04:53,260
No, I was doing fine.

3280
04:04:53,260 --> 04:04:55,260
That's the first time I've even seen

3281
04:04:55,260 --> 04:04:57,260
that game mode, first of all. Second of all,

3282
04:04:57,260 --> 04:04:59,430
killing somebody that's not a target,

3283
04:04:59,430 --> 04:05:01,430
you lose a full point.

3284
04:05:01,430 --> 04:05:04,379
Is that their way to make it so you

3285
04:05:04,379 --> 04:05:06,379
never don't ever do anything bad?

3286
04:05:06,379 --> 04:05:08,739
Is that like the anti-grief

3287
04:05:08,739 --> 04:05:10,739
to make it so you just go to zero and you just lose

3288
04:05:10,739 --> 04:05:12,739
if you shoot somebody that's not a guy that you need

3289
04:05:12,739 --> 04:05:20,420
to go after?

3290
04:05:20,420 --> 04:05:22,420
Because if you play into five points, losing one point

3291
04:05:22,420 --> 04:05:24,420
is a total disaster.

3292
04:05:24,420 --> 04:05:26,920
It's a complete disaster.

3293
04:05:26,920 --> 04:05:33,059
Only play into five,

3294
04:05:33,059 --> 04:05:35,750
then the only way you can get a point

3295
04:05:35,750 --> 04:05:43,620
you'll never make it to Hitman 2 Nationals.

3296
04:05:43,620 --> 04:05:46,180
I want to try that again,

3297
04:05:46,180 --> 04:06:09,290
now knowing that that's going to happen.

3298
04:06:09,290 --> 04:06:11,290
Guns exist to stop someone else from getting

3299
04:06:11,290 --> 04:06:13,290
a point if you don't have time to get unnoticed

3300
04:06:13,290 --> 04:06:15,290
and kill.

3301
04:06:15,290 --> 04:06:20,469
But wouldn't you lose a point?

3302
04:06:20,469 --> 04:06:25,979
So you shoot the guy

3303
04:06:25,979 --> 04:06:30,649
from far away,

3304
04:06:30,649 --> 04:06:35,059
not if they're the target.

3305
04:06:35,059 --> 04:06:37,059
But that makes it so they can't

3306
04:06:37,059 --> 04:06:39,059
get the point. But wouldn't that person be

3307
04:06:39,059 --> 04:06:41,059
alive in their mode?

3308
04:06:41,059 --> 04:06:43,059
I thought it was like

3309
04:06:43,059 --> 04:06:51,959
separate realities.

3310
04:06:51,959 --> 04:06:53,959
You can't get to him in 20 seconds.

3311
04:06:53,959 --> 04:06:55,959
Alright, let's do it again. Let's try it again.

3312
04:06:55,959 --> 04:07:10,149
But how did he

3313
04:07:10,149 --> 04:07:24,420
get two points?

3314
04:07:24,420 --> 04:07:26,420
Because he had two points at one time after one person.

3315
04:07:26,420 --> 04:07:28,979
He got a

3316
04:07:28,979 --> 04:07:43,190
costume bonus?

3317
04:07:43,190 --> 04:07:45,190
No, that's not even real.

3318
04:07:45,190 --> 04:07:56,969
There's no costume bonus.

3319
04:07:56,969 --> 04:08:13,739
There's a syncing issue? Oh.

3320
04:08:13,739 --> 04:08:16,170
Okay, let's try this again.

3321
04:08:20,170 --> 04:08:22,170
Who the hell are we?

3322
04:08:30,340 --> 04:08:33,100
Alright, what do we got here?

3323
04:08:33,100 --> 04:08:35,100
Um,

3324
04:08:35,100 --> 04:08:37,100
crowbar break.

3325
04:08:37,100 --> 04:08:39,100
I'll take it.

3326
04:08:39,100 --> 04:08:41,100
Wait, where'd you get that disguised?

3327
04:08:48,409 --> 04:08:56,920
He's waiting for me.

3328
04:08:56,920 --> 04:08:58,920
He's

3329
04:08:58,920 --> 04:09:00,920
waiting for me. That was so

3330
04:09:00,920 --> 04:09:04,250
nice of you.

3331
04:09:04,250 --> 04:09:10,709
He's like, okay, you ready? Alright.

3332
04:09:58,309 --> 04:10:06,889
I'm actually in the co-op mode.

3333
04:10:08,889 --> 04:10:11,899
Do you think

3334
04:10:11,899 --> 04:10:13,899
or I mean

3335
04:10:13,899 --> 04:10:16,840
what?

3336
04:10:16,840 --> 04:10:21,450
Target eliminated.

3337
04:10:21,450 --> 04:10:29,510
Your kill was witnessed.

3338
04:10:29,510 --> 04:10:31,510
Next target in 10 seconds.

3339
04:10:31,510 --> 04:10:34,260
Your opponent

3340
04:10:34,260 --> 04:10:36,260
killed the target.

3341
04:10:36,260 --> 04:10:38,260
And nobody noticed it?

3342
04:10:38,260 --> 04:10:40,260
Nobody noticed his kill?

3343
04:10:40,260 --> 04:10:42,889
No, he's like running around

3344
04:10:42,889 --> 04:10:54,340
punching people.

3345
04:10:54,340 --> 04:10:57,219
He didn't use a brick.

3346
04:10:57,219 --> 04:10:59,219
Well, he got noticed.

3347
04:10:59,219 --> 04:11:01,219
What's going on here? Who's firing?

3348
04:11:06,729 --> 04:11:24,629
Coming up here? Nope.

3349
04:11:24,629 --> 04:11:26,629
This is not a bathroom. I thought this was a bathroom.

3350
04:11:39,860 --> 04:11:42,739
What do we got? Ghost coin.

3351
04:11:51,379 --> 04:11:53,379
Uh, are we both not killing him?

3352
04:11:55,379 --> 04:11:57,379
I don't think this is... Where are you coming from?

3353
04:11:57,379 --> 04:11:59,379
Get out of here!

3354
04:11:59,379 --> 04:12:01,379
Five. Four.

3355
04:12:01,379 --> 04:12:03,379
Three. Two.

3356
04:12:03,379 --> 04:12:05,379
One.

3357
04:12:05,379 --> 04:12:07,379
There's like too much going on here.

3358
04:12:07,379 --> 04:12:10,459
Find and eliminate.

3359
04:12:10,459 --> 04:12:16,540
Opponent changed disguise.

3360
04:12:20,500 --> 04:12:22,870
Alright, well it's zero to zero.

3361
04:12:22,870 --> 04:12:24,870
Back in the fight.

3362
04:12:24,870 --> 04:12:26,870
Careful. Your enemy will still recognize you.

3363
04:12:31,079 --> 04:12:38,500
Alright, so when you...

3364
04:12:38,500 --> 04:12:40,500
I'm automatically just still...

3365
04:12:40,500 --> 04:12:42,500
I don't get to start over.

3366
04:12:42,500 --> 04:12:44,500
I'm out in combat still.

3367
04:12:44,500 --> 04:12:52,250
Yeah, I know she just said that

3368
04:12:52,250 --> 04:12:54,250
but that's still like where the fuck am I supposed to go?

3369
04:12:54,250 --> 04:12:56,250
Careful. Your enemy will still recognize you.

3370
04:12:56,250 --> 04:12:58,250
I'm still hunted.

3371
04:12:58,250 --> 04:13:00,250
So I'll just pull the guy in the fucking tank top

3372
04:13:00,250 --> 04:13:02,250
aside and take his tank top?

3373
04:13:02,250 --> 04:13:06,020
I can't even take his disguise.

3374
04:13:06,020 --> 04:13:20,229
I need a disguise.

3375
04:13:22,229 --> 04:13:24,229
He'd want to do better this time.

3376
04:13:24,229 --> 04:13:26,229
Your opponent just picked up a weapon.

3377
04:13:30,329 --> 04:13:32,329
I can't take that guy's clothes.

3378
04:13:32,329 --> 04:13:35,340
There is still some time to go.

3379
04:13:40,389 --> 04:13:42,389
Your opponent just picked up additional equipment.

3380
04:13:42,389 --> 04:13:49,420
Wow.

3381
04:13:49,420 --> 04:13:51,420
Jumped by this other man.

3382
04:13:51,420 --> 04:13:53,420
The upper down, he's down.

3383
04:13:53,420 --> 04:13:55,420
I need a disguise.

3384
04:13:55,420 --> 04:13:57,420
Your opponent killed the target.

3385
04:13:57,420 --> 04:13:59,420
God, I'm gonna lose.

3386
04:14:05,879 --> 04:14:07,879
You are losing. Assert yourself.

3387
04:14:07,879 --> 04:14:09,879
Okay.

3388
04:14:09,879 --> 04:14:11,879
Score zero to one.

3389
04:14:11,879 --> 04:14:13,879
I'll assert myself.

3390
04:14:13,879 --> 04:14:15,879
Target will be lost in ten seconds.

3391
04:14:15,879 --> 04:14:17,879
Anybody here? What? Hold on.

3392
04:14:17,879 --> 04:14:19,879
Your opponent just picked up additional equipment.

3393
04:14:19,879 --> 04:14:22,309
Five, four, three.

3394
04:14:22,309 --> 04:14:24,309
Target lost.

3395
04:14:24,309 --> 04:14:26,309
Target eliminated.

3396
04:14:26,309 --> 04:14:28,309
New target.

3397
04:14:28,309 --> 04:14:30,309
Find and eliminate.

3398
04:14:30,309 --> 04:14:32,309
I don't even want to play this anymore.

3399
04:14:37,110 --> 04:14:39,110
I don't think this is very fun.

3400
04:14:39,110 --> 04:14:41,110
I really don't.

3401
04:14:41,110 --> 04:14:43,110
All even.

3402
04:14:43,110 --> 04:14:45,290
Your opponent changed disguise.

3403
04:14:45,290 --> 04:14:51,690
Back in the fight.

3404
04:14:51,690 --> 04:14:53,690
Careful. Your enemy will still recognize you.

3405
04:14:53,690 --> 04:14:55,690
Yeah, I know.

3406
04:14:55,690 --> 04:15:06,569
So I...

3407
04:15:06,569 --> 04:15:08,569
Oh my fucking god.

3408
04:15:08,569 --> 04:15:12,540
This is the same outfit.

3409
04:15:12,540 --> 04:15:14,540
It's the same guy.

3410
04:15:14,540 --> 04:15:18,760
You are losing.

3411
04:15:18,760 --> 04:15:20,760
Assert yourself.

3412
04:15:20,760 --> 04:15:22,760
That just hit me. I just killed me.

3413
04:15:22,760 --> 04:15:37,420
Score zero to one.

3414
04:15:37,420 --> 04:15:40,549
I don't know where to put him.

3415
04:15:40,549 --> 04:15:51,049
Someone's gonna come in here.

3416
04:15:51,049 --> 04:15:53,290
Gotta go up.

3417
04:15:53,290 --> 04:16:02,440
Can I get up through here?

3418
04:16:02,440 --> 04:16:19,270
I don't have any items.

3419
04:16:19,270 --> 04:16:21,270
I need to find something to kill him with silently.

3420
04:16:21,270 --> 04:16:36,250
Christ.

3421
04:16:36,250 --> 04:16:38,250
Oh god.

3422
04:16:38,250 --> 04:16:45,670
Give me a break.

3423
04:16:45,670 --> 04:16:47,670
You can't be here, sir.

3424
04:16:47,670 --> 04:16:54,200
Your opponent changed disguise.

3425
04:16:56,819 --> 04:16:59,829
Yeah, I have a mini...

3426
04:16:59,829 --> 04:17:01,829
I know I have a minimap, but I have to find something.

3427
04:17:01,829 --> 04:17:03,829
Back in the fight.

3428
04:17:03,829 --> 04:17:05,829
Careful.

3429
04:17:05,829 --> 04:17:08,069
I hate it. I don't want to play it anymore.

3430
04:17:08,069 --> 04:17:34,229
I hate that.

3431
04:17:34,229 --> 04:17:36,540
I can't do this?

3432
04:17:36,540 --> 04:17:46,709
No. Do the patch notes.

3433
04:17:46,709 --> 04:17:56,760
I want to do this.

3434
04:17:56,760 --> 04:18:08,389
I'm gonna go back to here.

3435
04:18:08,389 --> 04:18:10,760
I understood how it all worked.

3436
04:18:10,760 --> 04:18:13,129
It just seems like...

3437
04:18:13,129 --> 04:18:20,540
I don't know. I just don't...

3438
04:18:20,540 --> 04:18:23,350
I didn't like it at all.

3439
04:18:23,350 --> 04:18:33,190
There's more multiplayer? What?

3440
04:18:33,190 --> 04:18:50,149
This is the only one that's here.

3441
04:18:50,149 --> 04:18:52,149
I already did the sniper mode.

3442
04:18:58,100 --> 04:19:00,100
I know I'm not a great hitman player,

3443
04:19:00,100 --> 04:19:06,379
but I just want to scream right now

3444
04:19:06,379 --> 04:19:08,379
about how much I hate that fucking game mode.

3445
04:19:08,379 --> 04:19:11,450
I just want to yell it as loud as I can.

3446
04:19:11,450 --> 04:19:28,149
All right.

3447
04:19:28,149 --> 04:19:31,100
Create a contract.

3448
04:19:31,100 --> 04:19:35,510
Contract search. Trending.

3449
04:19:35,510 --> 04:19:41,190
Easy. With a heart.

3450
04:19:41,190 --> 04:19:45,479
Let's do easy.

3451
04:19:45,479 --> 04:19:53,590
Easy. By salt.

3452
04:19:53,590 --> 04:20:09,770
This one's trending.

3453
04:20:09,770 --> 04:20:12,010
Eliminate Christopher May.

3454
04:20:12,010 --> 04:20:26,579
All right.

3455
04:20:26,579 --> 04:20:34,520
Are you serious?

3456
04:20:34,520 --> 04:20:36,520
That's it. Okay.

3457
04:20:36,520 --> 04:20:38,520
That's it. Just shoot him and hit the button.

3458
04:20:41,850 --> 04:20:43,850
Is this what you wanted?

3459
04:20:43,850 --> 04:20:49,930
How do I get a two-star?

3460
04:20:49,930 --> 04:20:51,930
Hold on. I'm gonna replay this mission.

3461
04:20:51,930 --> 04:20:54,100
Let's get a five-star on easy.

3462
04:21:05,100 --> 04:21:08,940
So what do I have for items?

3463
04:21:08,940 --> 04:21:10,940
Just fiberwire? Okay.

3464
04:21:10,940 --> 04:21:13,940
So I'm gonna coin this guy

3465
04:21:13,940 --> 04:21:22,899
and fiberwire him.

3466
04:21:22,899 --> 04:21:25,590
I'm so...

3467
04:21:25,590 --> 04:21:27,590
I'm so tilted right now.

3468
04:21:27,590 --> 04:21:29,590
From that fucking multiplayer mode.

3469
04:21:29,590 --> 04:21:40,149
I just need like a stress ball

3470
04:21:40,149 --> 04:21:42,149
to bite him with my teeth.

3471
04:22:23,100 --> 04:22:54,629
I think I have to stop playing.

3472
04:22:54,629 --> 04:22:56,629
I have to stop playing. I'm so...

3473
04:22:56,629 --> 04:23:00,469
Oh my god.

3474
04:23:23,639 --> 04:23:27,020
All right. I gotta get ready for tomorrow.

3475
04:23:55,540 --> 04:23:57,540
Oh, I'm so upset.

3476
04:23:57,540 --> 04:24:11,559
So tomorrow is the

3477
04:24:11,559 --> 04:24:14,500
green screen stream.

3478
04:24:14,500 --> 04:24:25,700
That should be a lot of fun. Tomorrow afternoon.

3479
04:24:25,700 --> 04:24:37,030
Why not some more ghost mode?

3480
04:24:37,030 --> 04:24:40,620
No, I'm never opening that ever again.

3481
04:24:40,620 --> 04:24:45,479
I really don't know what time.

3482
04:24:45,479 --> 04:24:51,430
I think it's kind of whenever

3483
04:24:51,430 --> 04:24:53,430
I want to start it, I think.

3484
04:24:53,430 --> 04:24:57,659
But actually, let's do this now.

3485
04:24:57,659 --> 04:24:59,659
Yeah, I'm out of here.

3486
04:24:59,659 --> 04:25:09,129
Because there are some things I need to do.

3487
04:25:09,129 --> 04:25:11,129
And I'm going to freak out

3488
04:25:11,129 --> 04:25:13,879
if I don't get out of here.

3489
04:25:13,879 --> 04:25:26,229
Like this game.

3490
04:25:26,229 --> 04:25:28,229
Why would they put that in the options menu?

3491
04:25:28,229 --> 04:25:37,750
Anyways.

3492
04:25:37,750 --> 04:25:39,750
Let me get this back to you guys.

3493
04:25:39,750 --> 04:25:42,120
Tomorrow, probably around

3494
04:25:42,120 --> 04:25:44,120
let's see, 1, 2, 3, 4.

3495
04:25:44,120 --> 04:25:46,120
I'm going to try

3496
04:25:46,120 --> 04:25:48,120
I'm assuming it's going to happen around 12 or 1 Pacific.

3497
04:25:48,120 --> 04:25:52,659
So.

3498
04:25:52,659 --> 04:25:54,659
Probably around 3 to 4 Eastern is when it's going to start.

3499
04:25:54,659 --> 04:26:01,899
I had a poll. Might as well show it

3500
04:26:01,899 --> 04:26:06,760
one more time.

3501
04:26:06,760 --> 04:26:08,760
One of the mods

3502
04:26:08,760 --> 04:26:12,090
have that poll for the memes.

3503
04:26:12,090 --> 04:26:16,299
Because I

3504
04:26:16,299 --> 04:26:18,299
have it somewhere here. It just would take me a minute to find it.

3505
04:26:18,299 --> 04:26:21,940
There it is.

3506
04:26:21,940 --> 04:26:23,940
So, there were a lot of responses.

3507
04:26:23,940 --> 04:26:28,729
Take a look there.

3508
04:26:28,729 --> 04:26:30,729
And it looks like

3509
04:26:30,729 --> 04:26:41,420
I'll leave this open for like 5 minutes.

3510
04:26:41,420 --> 04:26:43,420
It looks like

3511
04:26:43,420 --> 04:26:45,420
the top 3 are JoJoPose's

3512
04:26:45,420 --> 04:26:47,909
CSI Sunglass

3513
04:26:47,909 --> 04:26:49,909
One-liners and Infinity War stuff.

3514
04:26:49,909 --> 04:26:53,940
So, I'm going to have to look up

3515
04:26:53,940 --> 04:26:57,659
some of those. I know there's already

3516
04:26:57,659 --> 04:27:07,959
some highly requested ones.

3517
04:27:07,959 --> 04:27:16,729
But, let me see

3518
04:27:16,729 --> 04:27:25,180
here. Yeah, so that's what it's going to be.

3519
04:27:25,180 --> 04:27:27,420
It will be

3520
04:27:27,420 --> 04:27:32,149
these listed here.

3521
04:27:32,149 --> 04:27:34,149
With that, if you want to take off

3522
04:27:34,149 --> 04:27:37,670
I'll see you tomorrow.

3523
04:27:37,670 --> 04:27:39,670
Probably around 4

3524
04:27:39,670 --> 04:27:41,670
to 5 PM Eastern.

3525
04:27:41,670 --> 04:27:44,940
I'd say between

3526
04:27:44,940 --> 04:27:46,940
like 4 and 7 Eastern is

3527
04:27:46,940 --> 04:27:48,940
I'm going to try to start at the typical time.

3528
04:27:48,940 --> 04:27:54,500
I'm trying to think of anything else to

3529
04:27:54,500 --> 04:27:59,750
talk about here before I go.

3530
04:27:59,750 --> 04:28:01,750
I'm just sitting here trying to think.

3531
04:28:01,750 --> 04:28:09,239
Uh, Deltarune.

3532
04:28:09,239 --> 04:28:11,239
I will play Deltarune probably

3533
04:28:11,239 --> 04:28:13,239
at a later date.

3534
04:28:13,239 --> 04:28:21,159
Not right now.

3535
04:28:21,159 --> 04:28:23,159
Because I have to go to

3536
04:28:23,159 --> 04:28:25,159
Best Buy.

3537
04:28:25,159 --> 04:28:27,159
Or Walmart.

3538
04:28:27,159 --> 04:28:29,159
Or Target or something.

3539
04:28:29,159 --> 04:28:31,159
Because there are still like

3540
04:28:31,159 --> 04:28:33,159
at least a couple dozen things that I still

3541
04:28:33,159 --> 04:28:35,159
need. And I need to go while

3542
04:28:35,159 --> 04:28:41,739
they're still open.

3543
04:28:41,739 --> 04:28:43,739
So, I'm not entirely sure

3544
04:28:43,739 --> 04:28:45,739
which one of these stores I'm going to be going to.

3545
04:28:45,739 --> 04:28:57,319
It is a good question.

3546
04:28:57,319 --> 04:29:04,620
Because there's still props that I need.

3547
04:29:04,620 --> 04:29:07,819
I bought some stuff

3548
04:29:07,819 --> 04:29:09,819
but I need... Whoa!

3549
04:29:09,819 --> 04:29:14,229
I'm coming in.

3550
04:29:14,229 --> 04:29:17,159
Thank you to

3551
04:29:17,159 --> 04:29:19,159
Amphiric for the 5 community subs.

3552
04:29:19,159 --> 04:29:21,780
Have some subs before you go.

3553
04:29:21,780 --> 04:29:27,739
Oh, thank you dude.

3554
04:29:27,739 --> 04:29:30,360
Means a lot. Thanks a lot.

3555
04:29:30,360 --> 04:29:37,270
Because the thing that I need to buy

3556
04:29:37,270 --> 04:29:39,270
I was looking at online

3557
04:29:39,270 --> 04:29:42,920
and you

3558
04:29:42,920 --> 04:29:44,920
have to kind of get it at like a Target

3559
04:29:44,920 --> 04:29:46,920
or a Best Buy or something like that.

3560
04:29:46,920 --> 04:29:48,920
I need to see. I know there's like a shitload

3561
04:29:48,920 --> 04:29:50,920
of like Best Buys,

3562
04:29:50,920 --> 04:29:52,920
Walmarts, Targets. They're everywhere around here.

3563
04:29:52,920 --> 04:29:54,920
This is Las Vegas.

3564
04:29:54,920 --> 04:29:58,950
They are fucking everywhere.

3565
04:29:58,950 --> 04:30:00,950
Alright, let's do the bits.

3566
04:30:00,950 --> 04:30:06,709
He's an inflatable microphone.

3567
04:30:06,709 --> 04:30:12,729
Take care everybody.

3568
04:30:12,729 --> 04:30:15,610
See you soon.

3569
04:30:15,610 --> 04:30:18,620
It's time for me to read.

3570
04:30:18,620 --> 04:30:20,620
So, with that, thank you for $3

3571
04:30:20,620 --> 04:30:25,030
to Hasnain. Thanks with 3 bucks.

3572
04:30:25,030 --> 04:30:27,030
Terrible late streamer. Thank you.

3573
04:30:27,030 --> 04:30:30,680
I was a little late today.

3574
04:30:30,680 --> 04:30:33,620
That's right. Thank you Superspy

3575
04:30:33,620 --> 04:30:38,420
Burger Flipper for the $1.

3576
04:30:38,420 --> 04:30:40,420
Hey Jerm, I had a dream last night with you in it.

3577
04:30:40,420 --> 04:30:42,420
You were a guest speaker at some event

3578
04:30:42,420 --> 04:30:44,420
and asked if everyone, if they

3579
04:30:44,420 --> 04:30:46,420
knew you. I jokingly said that I knew you because

3580
04:30:46,420 --> 04:30:48,420
you murdered someone very specific, but then you

3581
04:30:48,420 --> 04:30:50,420
stared to be dead in the face.

3582
04:30:50,420 --> 04:30:52,659
And so if you say that again I'm gonna

3583
04:30:52,659 --> 04:30:54,659
blow your head off.

3584
04:30:54,659 --> 04:30:57,610
Jesus! You still

3585
04:30:57,610 --> 04:31:00,680
had the mic on.

3586
04:31:00,680 --> 04:31:04,579
What the fuck?

3587
04:31:04,579 --> 04:31:06,579
Why are you having that kind of dream about me?

3588
04:31:06,579 --> 04:31:11,700
Thank you so much dude. But

3589
04:31:11,700 --> 04:31:16,180
Jesus. Zero Sue,

3590
04:31:16,180 --> 04:31:18,180
thanks for the $1.50. Thanks for starting the stream

3591
04:31:18,180 --> 04:31:20,180
the second I got home and turned on the tub.

3592
04:31:20,180 --> 04:31:22,180
Too bad I had to kill a lot of rats

3593
04:31:22,180 --> 04:31:24,180
today at work. Sorry to hear that.

3594
04:31:24,180 --> 04:31:26,180
I'm sorry about the rats too.

3595
04:31:26,180 --> 04:31:31,110
But thank you Zero Sue. Thank you Hasnain again

3596
04:31:31,110 --> 04:31:33,110
for a dollar. I have a report for Unium in for tomorrow.

3597
04:31:33,110 --> 04:31:35,110
I've been called to do

3598
04:31:35,110 --> 04:31:37,110
it with

3599
04:31:37,110 --> 04:31:39,110
mates as soon as the stream starts.

3600
04:31:39,110 --> 04:31:43,530
Have fun though. Thank you Hasnain.

3601
04:31:43,530 --> 04:31:48,139
Hey Mad.

3602
04:31:48,139 --> 04:31:50,139
Thank you Mad47 for the $1. Can we expect

3603
04:31:50,139 --> 04:31:52,139
a one on one cage max between Jermis Conscious

3604
04:31:52,139 --> 04:31:54,139
and the chat telling him

3605
04:31:54,139 --> 04:31:56,139
to drown a woman in a toilet

3606
04:31:56,139 --> 04:31:58,139
in the next rumble?

3607
04:31:58,139 --> 04:32:05,350
What? Thank you.

3608
04:32:05,350 --> 04:32:07,350
Thank you GarfieldTheMondayKiller for the $1.

3609
04:32:07,350 --> 04:32:09,350
Jerm, I'm running away from smileydons.

3610
04:32:09,350 --> 04:32:12,360
They're a kind of ancient

3611
04:32:12,360 --> 04:32:14,360
tune tribe. Whoa, that was

3612
04:32:14,360 --> 04:32:16,979
close. Remember how

3613
04:32:16,979 --> 04:32:18,979
you made me your feline ambassador?

3614
04:32:18,979 --> 04:32:21,290
I mean, you

3615
04:32:21,290 --> 04:32:23,290
are. You're the only cat I think that

3616
04:32:23,290 --> 04:32:25,719
watches. Well, the

3617
04:32:25,719 --> 04:32:27,719
Goodwill tour turned sour real

3618
04:32:27,719 --> 04:32:29,719
quick. Just showed them Otto's

3619
04:32:29,719 --> 04:32:31,719
Big Adventure and they flipped out at me.

3620
04:32:31,719 --> 04:32:33,719
You've got no idea how much

3621
04:32:33,719 --> 04:32:35,719
it's been finding a place in this temple with

3622
04:32:35,719 --> 04:32:38,979
Wi-Fi. What the fuck?

3623
04:32:38,979 --> 04:32:40,979
I'm so lost. Thank you Garfield

3624
04:32:40,979 --> 04:32:43,670
for the $1.

3625
04:32:43,670 --> 04:32:51,219
What the fuck? Thank you

3626
04:32:51,219 --> 04:32:57,690
WinceRind for the $3.

3627
04:32:57,690 --> 04:32:59,690
I just finished fall quarter and

3628
04:32:59,690 --> 04:33:01,690
totally nailed my art history exam.

3629
04:33:01,690 --> 04:33:03,690
Yes, I'm paying money to boast about this.

3630
04:33:03,690 --> 04:33:10,580
Congratulations.

3631
04:33:10,580 --> 04:33:14,299
Hopefully you did well. Fall quarter.

3632
04:33:14,299 --> 04:33:18,069
So is the first semester

3633
04:33:18,069 --> 04:33:20,380
college and university

3634
04:33:20,380 --> 04:33:22,380
done?

3635
04:33:22,380 --> 04:33:24,380
Semesters are weird because

3636
04:33:24,380 --> 04:33:26,380
some of them start in September.

3637
04:33:26,380 --> 04:33:28,380
Some start in January, right?

3638
04:33:28,380 --> 04:33:32,540
Midterms, okay. I see.

3639
04:33:32,540 --> 04:33:34,840
Not yet. Okay.

3640
04:33:34,840 --> 04:33:37,659
But congratulations, dude. Thanks a lot for the $3.

3641
04:33:37,659 --> 04:33:40,150
Matty numbers.

3642
04:33:40,150 --> 04:33:42,150
Thanks for the $10 Matty numbers. When are

3643
04:33:42,150 --> 04:33:44,150
you going to finish your Hitman Absolution

3644
04:33:44,150 --> 04:33:47,099
Let's Play? I will

3645
04:33:47,099 --> 04:33:49,099
finish it after doing ghost mode.

3646
04:33:49,099 --> 04:33:51,099
Three more times.

3647
04:33:51,099 --> 04:33:54,040
And the answer to that

3648
04:33:54,040 --> 04:33:57,880
that means it's never happening.

3649
04:33:57,880 --> 04:33:59,880
But thank you for the $10, dude. Appreciate it.

3650
04:33:59,880 --> 04:34:01,880
Flub a gut thanks for the $1.

3651
04:34:01,880 --> 04:34:03,880
Hey Jeremy, you hear about

3652
04:34:03,880 --> 04:34:05,880
Nolan Cassidy. Poor sucker drowned himself

3653
04:34:05,880 --> 04:34:07,880
in his own vomit and put himself in the bathroom

3654
04:34:07,880 --> 04:34:10,380
wardrobe.

3655
04:34:10,380 --> 04:34:12,619
That's fucked up.

3656
04:34:12,619 --> 04:34:17,290
I can't believe that happened.

3657
04:34:17,290 --> 04:34:19,290
Thank you Teetles for the $2.40

3658
04:34:19,290 --> 04:34:21,290
No messages, just thank you, dude.

3659
04:34:21,290 --> 04:34:23,720
Anonymousgifter gave the $10

3660
04:34:23,720 --> 04:34:25,720
community subs

3661
04:34:25,720 --> 04:34:29,560
earlier. Thank you so much, dude.

3662
04:34:29,560 --> 04:34:33,209
That's a lot of community subs.

3663
04:34:33,209 --> 04:34:36,279
Hopefully people

3664
04:34:36,279 --> 04:34:38,840
Is there a way

3665
04:34:38,840 --> 04:34:40,840
to tell? I can see who got them, but

3666
04:34:40,840 --> 04:34:44,099
I wonder

3667
04:34:44,099 --> 04:34:47,049
I wonder what the actual algorithm here is.

3668
04:34:47,049 --> 04:34:49,220
Is it possible just to

3669
04:34:49,220 --> 04:34:51,220
get one if you've already been subscribed?

3670
04:34:51,220 --> 04:34:53,909
I wonder if there's a wait on it.

3671
04:34:53,909 --> 04:34:57,430
Somewhere in the back end.

3672
04:34:57,430 --> 04:34:59,430
So they just show up as regular subs. Okay, that's cool.

3673
04:34:59,430 --> 04:35:01,430
Well, congratulations to everybody and thank you

3674
04:35:01,430 --> 04:35:03,430
for even doing that, man.

3675
04:35:03,430 --> 04:35:05,430
Thanks for the $10. Going through a really hard time right now.

3676
04:35:05,430 --> 04:35:07,430
Thanks for the laughs. Hoping to sub soon.

3677
04:35:07,430 --> 04:35:10,119
Well, you've already paid

3678
04:35:10,119 --> 04:35:12,740
for that sub. Twice here.

3679
04:35:12,740 --> 04:35:15,430
So thank you for even

3680
04:35:15,430 --> 04:35:18,119
considering. Thanks a lot, man.

3681
04:35:18,119 --> 04:35:20,119
Smellyboy, thanks for the $1. Do you think you'd be able

3682
04:35:20,119 --> 04:35:22,119
to fight off a man your size

3683
04:35:22,119 --> 04:35:24,119
but with more ambition if he challenged you to

3684
04:35:24,119 --> 04:35:27,319
a fight? Yeah.

3685
04:35:27,319 --> 04:35:29,319
I would kick the shit out of myself.

3686
04:35:29,319 --> 04:35:32,520
Definitely.

3687
04:35:32,520 --> 04:35:34,520
Stopit gave $1.45

3688
04:35:34,520 --> 04:35:36,520
Thanks a lot, Stopit. You can tell when

3689
04:35:36,520 --> 04:35:38,520
it goes into sociopath mode when it becomes really quiet.

3690
04:35:38,520 --> 04:35:45,619
Coable, thanks

3691
04:35:45,619 --> 04:35:47,619
for the $5.

3692
04:35:47,619 --> 04:35:49,619
The smoke from the wildfire here in California

3693
04:35:49,619 --> 04:35:51,619
is so bad I can't leave the house.

3694
04:35:51,619 --> 04:35:53,619
So thank you for keeping me entertained while

3695
04:35:53,619 --> 04:35:56,630
I'm stuck inside.

3696
04:35:56,630 --> 04:35:58,630
Stay safe. Be careful.

3697
04:35:58,630 --> 04:36:02,279
I'm glad to be hanging out here.

3698
04:36:02,279 --> 04:36:08,040
Hopefully you don't see

3699
04:36:08,040 --> 04:36:10,599
anything too bad from that.

3700
04:36:10,599 --> 04:36:12,599
Take care. If you're in California, take care of yourselves,

3701
04:36:12,599 --> 04:36:16,630
guys. Much love to you.

3702
04:36:16,630 --> 04:36:19,700
It's Rusgara,

3703
04:36:19,700 --> 04:36:22,069
thanks for the $1.

3704
04:36:22,069 --> 04:36:24,069
Hey, Jerm's just dropping in and noticed that you pronounced my name.

3705
04:36:24,069 --> 04:36:26,069
It's Rusgara, but it's actually

3706
04:36:26,069 --> 04:36:28,069
Itrus...

3707
04:36:28,069 --> 04:36:30,069
Itrusgara.

3708
04:36:30,069 --> 04:36:32,759
Citrusgara.

3709
04:36:32,759 --> 04:36:34,759
Like citrus and gara. Anyway, I gotta go.

3710
04:36:34,759 --> 04:36:36,759
Oh, okay. Cool.

3711
04:36:36,759 --> 04:36:39,639
I get you. Thanks.

3712
04:36:39,639 --> 04:36:43,909
Thank you.

3713
04:36:43,909 --> 04:36:45,909
For the $1 and correcting my pronunciation.

3714
04:36:45,909 --> 04:36:48,340
Lazy Luke, thanks for the $1.

3715
04:36:48,340 --> 04:36:50,340
I am from the future and wanted to tell you that it was a good stream tomorrow.

3716
04:36:50,340 --> 04:36:52,340
Just don't eat that spider.

3717
04:36:52,340 --> 04:36:56,869
Gross. I gotta get out of here.

3718
04:36:56,869 --> 04:36:59,819
I gotta go.

3719
04:36:59,819 --> 04:37:01,819
E-Cookie, thanks for the $1. If you were an instrument,

3720
04:37:01,819 --> 04:37:04,250
what type of instrument would you be?

3721
04:37:04,250 --> 04:37:06,250
Probably like a cello.

3722
04:37:06,250 --> 04:37:09,259
Thanks, though, dude. Thank you, DivUSP for the $3.

3723
04:37:09,259 --> 04:37:12,970
Thanks a lot.

3724
04:37:12,970 --> 04:37:16,490
$3 from Div.

3725
04:37:16,490 --> 04:37:18,490
Talix gave $2. Thank you, Talix.

3726
04:37:18,490 --> 04:37:21,240
Kraiken recently started his

3727
04:37:21,240 --> 04:37:23,240
Ghost Commander series

3728
04:37:23,240 --> 04:37:25,240
where he sends four actors into a haunted house in order to

3729
04:37:25,240 --> 04:37:27,240
hunt a ghost.

3730
04:37:27,240 --> 04:37:29,240
At the same time, Chad is able to either help the actors by

3731
04:37:29,240 --> 04:37:31,419
voting on what they do or

3732
04:37:31,419 --> 04:37:33,419
help the ghost by voting on how it scares

3733
04:37:33,419 --> 04:37:35,419
the actors. It sounds a lot similar to the things you

3734
04:37:35,419 --> 04:37:37,419
wanted to do, a style

3735
04:37:37,419 --> 04:37:39,419
Twitch TV show with chat interaction.

3736
04:37:39,419 --> 04:37:41,419
Can we possibly expect a collab

3737
04:37:41,419 --> 04:37:43,849
in the future?

3738
04:37:43,849 --> 04:37:46,279
If it happens, it happens.

3739
04:37:46,279 --> 04:37:48,279
Yeah, there are plenty of things that I

3740
04:37:48,279 --> 04:37:50,279
want to do.

3741
04:37:50,279 --> 04:37:53,220
And if our paths cross, our paths

3742
04:37:53,220 --> 04:37:58,220
cross. Yeah, that's pretty

3743
04:37:58,220 --> 04:38:05,959
cool. We shall see.

3744
04:38:05,959 --> 04:38:08,459
But thanks for the $2, Talix.

3745
04:38:08,459 --> 04:38:10,459
That sounds really cool.

3746
04:38:10,459 --> 04:38:13,080
Hey, uh, Julis.

3747
04:38:13,080 --> 04:38:15,080
Julis. Julis.

3748
04:38:15,080 --> 04:38:17,580
Julis.

3749
04:38:17,580 --> 04:38:19,580
Thanks for the $1.

3750
04:38:19,580 --> 04:38:21,580
Hey, Jeremy, I've been watching you for a few months and I have to say you're one of a kind.

3751
04:38:21,580 --> 04:38:23,580
I usually don't subscribe to anyone but you.

3752
04:38:23,580 --> 04:38:25,580
Do you subscribe to anyone on Twitch? Do you have a favorite Twitch

3753
04:38:25,580 --> 04:38:27,580
streamer? By the way, so far you are my

3754
04:38:27,580 --> 04:38:29,580
favorite. Thank you for quality content. Thank you.

3755
04:38:29,580 --> 04:38:32,069
For the $1.

3756
04:38:32,069 --> 04:38:34,069
Do I have a favorite Twitch streamer?

3757
04:38:34,069 --> 04:38:38,599
Um...

3758
04:38:38,599 --> 04:38:43,400
Not necessarily.

3759
04:38:43,400 --> 04:38:48,580
I think that...

3760
04:38:48,580 --> 04:38:50,580
Talix, Vinny.

3761
04:38:50,580 --> 04:38:52,580
I think that the

3762
04:38:52,580 --> 04:38:54,580
friends and the people that I like that I know

3763
04:38:54,580 --> 04:38:56,580
on here, I would probably recommend their channels

3764
04:38:56,580 --> 04:38:58,580
because that's kind of how I found them in the

3765
04:38:58,580 --> 04:39:01,400
first place.

3766
04:39:01,400 --> 04:39:03,700
But I think I don't necessarily

3767
04:39:03,700 --> 04:39:05,700
have somebody that I watch

3768
04:39:05,700 --> 04:39:07,700
that I'm like, oh, that's my favorite streamer.

3769
04:39:07,700 --> 04:39:14,419
But yeah, I mean

3770
04:39:14,419 --> 04:39:16,419
I would say any of my friends that I know on the platform

3771
04:39:16,419 --> 04:39:18,419
or people that I would highly recommend.

3772
04:39:18,419 --> 04:39:23,099
He likes himself the most.

3773
04:39:23,099 --> 04:39:26,040
Oh yeah, yay.

3774
04:39:26,040 --> 04:39:28,220
Thank you, creepy ghost sales

3775
04:39:28,220 --> 04:39:30,220
for the $1. Hey, Jeremy, here's the last of my free

3776
04:39:30,220 --> 04:39:32,220
bits. My college campus is closed for the

3777
04:39:32,220 --> 04:39:34,220
rest of the week due to the horrendous air quality

3778
04:39:34,220 --> 04:39:36,220
in California. But hey,

3779
04:39:36,220 --> 04:39:38,220
that means I get some time to see the green

3780
04:39:38,220 --> 04:39:40,220
screen stream tomorrow. See you

3781
04:39:40,220 --> 04:39:43,930
then. Yeah, I mean

3782
04:39:43,930 --> 04:39:45,930
that's not...

3783
04:39:45,930 --> 04:39:47,930
I'm glad you're able to

3784
04:39:47,930 --> 04:39:49,930
participate and have fun on the streams

3785
04:39:49,930 --> 04:39:51,930
but also I'm sorry to hear

3786
04:39:51,930 --> 04:39:53,930
about you having to deal with that

3787
04:39:53,930 --> 04:39:55,930
shit. It sucks.

3788
04:39:55,930 --> 04:39:59,259
But just be careful.

3789
04:39:59,259 --> 04:40:01,259
We're all here. Glad to hang out.

3790
04:40:01,259 --> 04:40:04,200
Thank you for the $1, creepy ghost.

3791
04:40:04,200 --> 04:40:06,950
Afmeric gave

3792
04:40:06,950 --> 04:40:08,950
the five community subs right there right

3793
04:40:08,950 --> 04:40:12,470
now. Ten minutes ago, thanks a

3794
04:40:12,470 --> 04:40:17,340
lot. Thank you, extra cheesy for

3795
04:40:17,340 --> 04:40:19,340
the $1. How many vitamins does one regular assassination

3796
04:40:19,340 --> 04:40:21,340
give you?

3797
04:40:21,340 --> 04:40:24,790
Vitamins? I don't know. What does that mean?

3798
04:40:24,790 --> 04:40:28,500
Hey, double thanks for the $1. Hey

3799
04:40:28,500 --> 04:40:30,500
gamers, I fell asleep while watching the stream but don't

3800
04:40:30,500 --> 04:40:32,500
take it too personally. I haven't gotten

3801
04:40:32,500 --> 04:40:34,500
very much sleep today or the past week. Just kidding.

3802
04:40:34,500 --> 04:40:36,500
It's because Jerma doesn't know how to work save slots.

3803
04:40:36,500 --> 04:40:42,380
What?

3804
04:40:42,380 --> 04:40:44,380
Thank you, Dr. Clay

3805
04:40:44,380 --> 04:40:46,380
for the $1. I probably will not be able to watch

3806
04:40:46,380 --> 04:40:48,380
the green screen stream live sadly due to schedule

3807
04:40:48,380 --> 04:40:50,380
conflict. But I hope it goes well.

3808
04:40:50,380 --> 04:40:52,380
Also, the stream was a real hit, man. Take care. Thanks.

3809
04:40:52,380 --> 04:40:54,380
Ah, I got it. Nice.

3810
04:40:57,189 --> 04:40:59,189
Fudgean, awesome. Thanks for the $1. Hey

3811
04:40:59,189 --> 04:41:01,189
Jerma, I love the streams. I just wanted to ask you what your favorite

3812
04:41:01,189 --> 04:41:03,189
gorilla song is because they're my favorite band too.

3813
04:41:03,189 --> 04:41:05,189
Styla

3814
04:41:05,189 --> 04:41:09,479
That's probably my favorite song from

3815
04:41:09,479 --> 04:41:11,909
the band. I just like it.

3816
04:41:11,909 --> 04:41:17,479
There's a lot going on

3817
04:41:17,479 --> 04:41:27,909
in Styla. But yeah, there you go.

3818
04:41:27,909 --> 04:41:30,150
Thank you, Fudgean, awesome.

3819
04:41:30,150 --> 04:41:32,150
Thank you, Mad47 for the $1.

3820
04:41:32,150 --> 04:41:34,150
Nicest streamer, 2k18

3821
04:41:34,150 --> 04:41:36,970
Hey, is that me?

3822
04:41:36,970 --> 04:41:38,970
It's still surprising to have all your streams in my house

3823
04:41:38,970 --> 04:41:40,970
time zone. My home time zone.

3824
04:41:40,970 --> 04:41:42,970
Thank you for making your chat such a kind and welcome place

3825
04:41:42,970 --> 04:41:45,139
to everyone. Seriously.

3826
04:41:45,139 --> 04:41:47,139
You're a great influence. Thanks, man. Thank you.

3827
04:41:47,139 --> 04:41:49,770
I think this community is pretty good.

3828
04:41:49,770 --> 04:41:51,770
Except for when I have a meltdown

3829
04:41:51,770 --> 04:41:53,770
about multiplayer modes.

3830
04:41:53,770 --> 04:42:01,959
Fucking mode.

3831
04:42:01,959 --> 04:42:09,700
I just, I don't

3832
04:42:09,700 --> 04:42:11,700
nobody bring that up to me.

3833
04:42:11,700 --> 04:42:13,700
Then I command it. I demand it.

3834
04:42:13,700 --> 04:42:16,330
If I'm playing a game

3835
04:42:16,330 --> 04:42:18,330
like in a few days and all of a sudden I look over here

3836
04:42:18,330 --> 04:42:20,330
and it was like nice job in the Hitman multiplayer ghost

3837
04:42:20,330 --> 04:42:22,330
mode. I'm gonna

3838
04:42:22,330 --> 04:42:28,919
delete the chat. I'm just

3839
04:42:28,919 --> 04:42:31,419
kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

3840
04:42:31,419 --> 04:42:33,419
I'll put it into ghost mode.

3841
04:42:33,419 --> 04:42:36,939
Mario tennis all alone. No, that's not

3842
04:42:36,939 --> 04:42:38,939
even close to the level. Maybe it was.

3843
04:42:38,939 --> 04:42:42,459
How bad was Mario tennis in

3844
04:42:42,459 --> 04:42:44,459
regards to how mad I was at ghost mode?

3845
04:42:44,459 --> 04:42:47,139
Combine the two. Okay, if

3846
04:42:47,139 --> 04:43:00,069
Mario tennis was about

3847
04:43:00,069 --> 04:43:05,900
the same. Mario tennis was three

3848
04:43:05,900 --> 04:43:07,900
or two times as bad.

3849
04:43:07,900 --> 04:43:09,900
Mario tennis was way worse.

3850
04:43:15,349 --> 04:43:20,020
I love how that's the

3851
04:43:20,020 --> 04:43:22,020
that's like the barometer there.

3852
04:43:22,020 --> 04:43:24,020
Alright, is it

3853
04:43:24,020 --> 04:43:26,020
Mario tennis levels of fucking

3854
04:43:26,020 --> 04:43:28,650
meltdown? Mario tennis

3855
04:43:28,650 --> 04:43:30,650
you were upset for like two hours.

3856
04:43:33,659 --> 04:43:42,810
But like

3857
04:43:42,810 --> 04:43:44,810
let me just speak

3858
04:43:44,810 --> 04:43:47,299
my piece, right?

3859
04:43:47,299 --> 04:43:49,299
If I'm doing really bad

3860
04:43:49,299 --> 04:43:51,299
and I'm angry at losing

3861
04:43:51,299 --> 04:43:53,299
or something going wrong that I don't like

3862
04:43:53,299 --> 04:43:55,299
and I look over and chat and everyone's like oh my god

3863
04:43:55,299 --> 04:43:57,299
you're so stupid.

3864
04:43:57,299 --> 04:43:59,299
You're so bad. You're so dumb.

3865
04:43:59,299 --> 04:44:01,299
I'm just like I can't. I can't get it.

3866
04:44:01,299 --> 04:44:03,299
You know what I mean?

3867
04:44:03,299 --> 04:44:09,770
You know what I'm saying? It's like a

3868
04:44:09,770 --> 04:44:17,900
perfect trifecta.

3869
04:44:17,900 --> 04:44:19,900
It's like all three of those things

3870
04:44:19,900 --> 04:44:21,900
have to be happening at the same time.

3871
04:44:21,900 --> 04:44:25,290
Fucking Mario tennis.

3872
04:44:25,290 --> 04:44:27,290
The curve bullshit.

3873
04:44:27,290 --> 04:44:29,720
I never thought I was going to think

3874
04:44:29,720 --> 04:44:31,720
about it and now I'm twice as mad.

3875
04:44:31,720 --> 04:44:43,560
I'm going to have a nightmare tonight

3876
04:44:43,560 --> 04:44:45,560
that I'm playing Mario tennis

3877
04:44:45,560 --> 04:44:47,560
and ghost mode at the same time.

3878
04:44:47,560 --> 04:45:00,220
We've sent him into a

3879
04:45:00,220 --> 04:45:02,220
rage spiral. Call animal control.

3880
04:45:02,220 --> 04:45:04,779
Hey, don't ever bring it up

3881
04:45:04,779 --> 04:45:06,779
to me. Don't ever bring it up.

3882
04:45:06,779 --> 04:45:08,779
Animal control.

3883
04:45:08,779 --> 04:45:10,779
These are three things never to bring up

3884
04:45:10,779 --> 04:45:12,779
on one of these streams. Never bring up animal control.

3885
04:45:12,779 --> 04:45:14,779
Mario tennis or ghost mode.

3886
04:45:14,779 --> 04:45:16,779
Or skate 3.

3887
04:45:16,779 --> 04:45:29,259
Or Karazhan.

3888
04:45:29,259 --> 04:45:31,259
What's wrong with the first? Nothing.

3889
04:45:31,259 --> 04:45:34,459
Alright, that's it.

3890
04:45:34,459 --> 04:45:37,020
I will see you guys all tomorrow.

3891
04:45:37,020 --> 04:45:39,020
Devakitty gave $1 here right there right now.

3892
04:45:39,020 --> 04:45:41,020
German Jax, German Jax 2, German Comet, German Polito.

3893
04:45:41,020 --> 04:45:44,709
Thank you.

3894
04:45:44,709 --> 04:45:46,709
Double D with $1 right here. Anyway, what's the

3895
04:45:46,709 --> 04:45:48,709
update on the spider crab situation?

3896
04:45:48,709 --> 04:45:50,709
How many frogs have you put into each room?

3897
04:45:50,709 --> 04:45:52,709
There's a frog in every room.

3898
04:45:52,709 --> 04:45:55,340
We're good.

3899
04:45:55,340 --> 04:46:02,569
They have plenty of water. But

3900
04:46:02,569 --> 04:46:04,569
thanks everybody for watching. Here come the credits

3901
04:46:04,569 --> 04:46:07,639
for all the new subs. And old ones.

3902
04:46:07,639 --> 04:46:13,209
So I will see you all tomorrow

3903
04:46:13,209 --> 04:46:15,209
for the green screen stream.

3904
04:46:15,209 --> 04:46:20,709
It should be interesting.

3905
04:46:20,709 --> 04:46:26,279
I can promise you that.

3906
04:46:26,279 --> 04:46:28,279
Somewhere around

3907
04:46:28,279 --> 04:46:30,279
between 4 and 7 PM

3908
04:46:30,279 --> 04:46:32,279
Eastern time is when the stream will probably start.

3909
04:46:32,279 --> 04:46:35,099
If not, I will absolutely

3910
04:46:35,099 --> 04:46:37,849
let you know. It will be happening

3911
04:46:37,849 --> 04:46:39,849
tomorrow though, that's for sure.

3912
04:46:39,849 --> 04:46:50,459
Good night everybody.

3913
04:46:50,459 --> 04:46:53,270
Thanks again for watching. Oh, my

3914
04:46:53,270 --> 04:46:55,270
Hitman. Okay, so my rating

3915
04:46:55,270 --> 04:46:58,340
for Hitman is

3916
04:46:58,340 --> 04:47:00,340
all the new areas were fun.

3917
04:47:00,340 --> 04:47:02,340
I think the first area and the

3918
04:47:02,340 --> 04:47:04,340
last area were the best ones in

3919
04:47:04,340 --> 04:47:06,340
regards to how interesting I thought they

3920
04:47:06,340 --> 04:47:08,340
were for me. You can't really

3921
04:47:08,340 --> 04:47:10,340
racetrack like a

3922
04:47:10,340 --> 04:47:12,340
cult mansion.

3923
04:47:12,340 --> 04:47:14,340
Those are pretty amazing.

3924
04:47:14,340 --> 04:47:19,000
Seems like there's a lot of

3925
04:47:19,000 --> 04:47:24,250
content. I would say

3926
04:47:24,250 --> 04:47:26,250
give the multiplayer a try

3927
04:47:26,250 --> 04:47:28,250
if you really are into

3928
04:47:28,250 --> 04:47:31,259
pain

3929
04:47:31,259 --> 04:47:35,020
and stuff

3930
04:47:35,020 --> 04:47:41,029
that's not fun at all.

3931
04:47:41,029 --> 04:47:43,029
I brought it up again. Alright, alright.

3932
04:47:45,029 --> 04:47:47,029
The multiplayer mode is

3933
04:47:47,029 --> 04:47:49,529
good. I just didn't understand

3934
04:47:49,529 --> 04:47:51,529
it at first and when I finally understood it

3935
04:47:51,529 --> 04:47:53,529
I lost my mind because I was getting

3936
04:47:53,529 --> 04:47:55,529
fucking beat and then

3937
04:47:55,529 --> 04:47:57,529
it spiraled out of control after I shot that security

3938
04:47:57,529 --> 04:47:59,529
guard. Everything was just fine.

3939
04:47:59,529 --> 04:48:05,290
It was fun and

3940
04:48:05,290 --> 04:48:07,290
things were going well and then I started to

3941
04:48:07,290 --> 04:48:16,500
hate it. You still don't understand

3942
04:48:16,500 --> 04:48:18,869
it.

3943
04:48:18,869 --> 04:48:20,869
Am I supposed to understand how every

3944
04:48:20,869 --> 04:48:22,869
single thing that works in the first game

3945
04:48:22,869 --> 04:48:24,869
mode, first time I ever play it?

3946
04:48:24,869 --> 04:48:26,869
Watching a YouTube briefing

3947
04:48:26,869 --> 04:48:39,220
video about how to play it?

3948
04:48:39,220 --> 04:48:41,220
You rage quit both times.

3949
04:48:41,220 --> 04:48:44,099
That doesn't mean I will...

3950
04:48:44,099 --> 04:48:46,099
I mean I'm never going to play it again, but if I did

3951
04:48:46,099 --> 04:48:48,099
I would take it

3952
04:48:48,099 --> 04:48:53,029
slower and

3953
04:48:53,029 --> 04:48:55,590
hit the deck.

3954
04:48:55,590 --> 04:49:00,389
What is this?

3955
04:49:02,389 --> 04:49:05,459
Fuck you.

3956
04:49:05,459 --> 04:49:07,459
You guys suck.

3957
04:49:09,459 --> 04:49:11,900
That's for Dark Souls.

3958
04:49:26,979 --> 04:49:29,419
What the fuck was that?

3959
04:49:29,419 --> 04:49:32,040
Somebody links me that clip like every

3960
04:49:32,040 --> 04:49:34,040
couple of months here or every like...

3961
04:49:44,650 --> 04:49:46,650
Is that what I was doing during... Okay.

3962
04:49:46,650 --> 04:49:48,650
What was I doing?

3963
04:49:48,650 --> 04:49:50,650
Was I doing that during the

3964
04:49:50,650 --> 04:49:54,040
ghost mode? I don't remember

3965
04:49:54,040 --> 04:50:05,939
doing any. I just remember being angry.

3966
04:50:05,939 --> 04:50:07,939
Anybody have a clip during ghost mode? Was that

3967
04:50:07,939 --> 04:50:15,180
my worst? Because I will definitely

3968
04:50:15,180 --> 04:50:17,180
watch an embarrassing

3969
04:50:17,180 --> 04:50:25,880
meltdown right here.

3970
04:50:25,880 --> 04:50:27,880
You were going, oh my god.

3971
04:50:27,880 --> 04:50:33,060
You walk up into a food stand.

3972
04:50:33,060 --> 04:50:35,060
The woman running it looks at you...

3973
04:50:38,709 --> 04:50:48,569
I can even see the thumbnail for that one.

3974
04:50:48,569 --> 04:50:50,569
Like...

3975
04:50:50,569 --> 04:50:52,569
I don't know what that is at this point.

3976
04:50:52,569 --> 04:50:55,130
I can see the thumbnail.

3977
04:51:08,950 --> 04:51:12,409
Everything in this whole area.

3978
04:51:12,409 --> 04:51:15,220
Oh my god.

3979
04:51:15,220 --> 04:51:17,220
Oh my god. Look at how far away

3980
04:51:17,220 --> 04:51:19,220
I am.

3981
04:51:19,220 --> 04:51:21,779
Fuck this weapon.

3982
04:51:21,779 --> 04:51:24,220
This is Dark Souls again.

3983
04:51:24,220 --> 04:51:26,220
You swing over every...

3984
04:51:26,220 --> 04:51:28,220
Only use that weapon.

3985
04:51:28,220 --> 04:51:30,220
Only for a fucking boss. What a worthless fucking item.

3986
04:51:30,220 --> 04:51:32,220
Jesus Christ.

3987
04:51:32,220 --> 04:51:35,159
Oh my god.

3988
04:51:35,159 --> 04:51:37,159
I mean, that was probably what I did.

3989
04:51:37,159 --> 04:51:41,580
That's probably the same...

3990
04:51:41,580 --> 04:51:43,580
Is that the same clip? That could have been...

3991
04:51:43,580 --> 04:51:45,580
If you placed that on top of the ghost footage,

3992
04:51:45,580 --> 04:52:02,470
would it be the same thing?

3993
04:52:02,470 --> 04:52:04,470
I'm just like clicking...

3994
04:52:04,470 --> 04:52:09,900
Oh, this is the worst ever.

3995
04:52:09,900 --> 04:52:11,900
Oh my god.

3996
04:52:20,580 --> 04:52:22,580
Who ever said that in chat?

3997
04:52:22,580 --> 04:52:24,580
That started that.

3998
04:52:24,580 --> 04:52:26,819
You are fucking hilarious.

3999
04:52:26,819 --> 04:52:28,819
The Mario Tennis Link is legit.

4000
04:52:28,819 --> 04:52:30,819
You mean it's probably a gnome?

4001
04:52:30,819 --> 04:52:35,880
Let me check it.

4002
04:52:37,880 --> 04:52:44,340
This really is the Mario Tennis Link.

4003
04:52:44,340 --> 04:52:46,340
How did you get this so quickly?

4004
04:52:53,479 --> 04:52:57,130
Look at that shit.

4005
04:52:57,130 --> 04:53:07,819
What the fuck is this?

4006
04:53:07,819 --> 04:53:09,819
This guy's throwing a wiffle ball across the court.

4007
04:53:09,819 --> 04:53:13,080
Oh my lord.

4008
04:53:13,080 --> 04:53:25,099
That's not even the worst part.

4009
04:53:25,099 --> 04:53:30,220
Here it is.

4010
04:53:30,220 --> 04:53:35,459
I think I have to stop playing.

4011
04:53:35,459 --> 04:53:37,459
I have to stop playing.

4012
04:53:37,459 --> 04:53:39,459
Alright, I'm getting out of here.

4013
04:53:39,459 --> 04:53:41,459
I gotta go.

4014
04:53:41,459 --> 04:53:46,069
I gotta get out of here.

4015
04:53:46,069 --> 04:53:48,069
Anyways, thanks everybody for watching.

4016
04:53:48,069 --> 04:53:50,069
See you tomorrow. Have a great one.

4017
04:53:50,069 --> 04:53:52,069
I gotta get out of here. I'm not gonna be kidding.

4018
04:53:52,069 --> 04:53:56,680
Take care everybody. See you soon.
