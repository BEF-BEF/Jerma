1
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:45,609
What's up? How's it going? Oh shit. No, we're good. How's everybody doing? Good. How you been? It's been a little while.

2
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:08,310
We missed you. Hey, thank you. Hey, it goes both ways. I wanted to get back in the chair too.

3
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:16,439
How you doing? Everyone doing good? What's been going on? Anything new? Anything I should know?

4
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:22,950
I hope you're doing good. It's been a few weeks. Has it been three weeks or two and a half?

5
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:36,390
I don't know. Show us your face. Give me a second. It's been like a couple of weeks. Hold on.

6
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:48,599
Yeah, we're going to play Shadows of Doubt. I have something very important to talk about too.

7
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:58,329
I'm a little saddened to say this, but I don't think I'm going to be able to complete

8
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:05,959
Breath of the Wild before Tears of the Kingdom comes out. Sorry to all you Breath of the Wild

9
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:11,800
Andes. I don't think that's going to happen. The game comes out literally tomorrow. I don't think.

10
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:20,860
I promised. Wait, I promised. Did I? Did I actually promise to do this? Did I? Oh, fuck.

11
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:31,340
I did not promise I was going to beat this game. Did I? How deep of a promise was this?

12
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:39,539
I didn't say I was going to eat any articles of clothing, right? I didn't say I was going to eat

13
00:02:39,539 --> 00:03:01,770
any articles of clothing. Or did I? You promised. Oh, does anybody have a clip? You owe me 10 bucks.

14
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:08,340
Yeah, I'm probably just going to have to play Breath of the Wild while everybody else is playing.

15
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,550
It's going to be so stupid. You know how many people are going to come to the stream

16
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,949
in the next few days and be like, dude, what are you doing? What's wrong with you?

17
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:29,270
We will forgive you if you eat an article of clothing. No, I think I'm all right.

18
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:39,849
Does anybody have a quote for me? I'm at the podium right now. Yeah, hold on a minute.

19
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:46,150
Hold on. All the reporters are taking pictures. Anybody have a quote for me saying I was going to

20
00:03:46,150 --> 00:04:05,539
do that? I don't think anybody's got a quote. You did say. Well, someone will find it eventually.

21
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:13,509
But anyways, what if we just watch the Breath of the Wild story recap trailer and I hold a

22
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:20,870
controller in my hand while we watch it and I move like I'm dodging and stuff? Is that all right?

23
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:36,629
It's not the same. No. How long do I have till it's out? Is it out Friday, Saturday, Sunday?

24
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:43,019
When is it up? There's no way I'm going to beat this game. I'm just no way I'm going to beat it.

25
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:50,810
No, we're going to. Don't worry. I'm not concerned about it. Guys, the last I think I've played

26
00:04:51,850 --> 00:05:00,569
maybe three triple A games at launch. All the rest I play at least six months later.

27
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:08,009
And I don't know. Maybe do I play Tears of the Kingdom? I maybe have to beat Breath of the Wild

28
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:23,220
first. I'm ranting right now trying to find a way out of this. We will finish it. How do I find a

29
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:29,860
way out of this? All right. Anyways, how you doing? Hope you're doing good. I did want to play shadows

30
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:35,939
of doubt because Taleks brought it up. Said it was great. He said it's right up your alley. I was

31
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:50,250
like, really? He's like, yeah. I said, OK, if you do play Tears of the Kingdom, I'm not going to be

32
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:55,660
around. I'm going to savor the game for myself. That's fine. That's completely understandable.

33
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:04,490
Makes complete sense to me. OK, so let me first of all, let me just prove that I'm alive.

34
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:16,199
Right. Let me just get this over with. Hi. Yes, I'm alive. I exist. Also been seeing a lot of

35
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:23,110
people talk. It's weird because seeing a lot of people talk about Pegasus King 2 and they're

36
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:31,459
acting like I didn't get an advanced copy of that game. Honestly, like really? Really? You don't

37
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:41,589
think that I already have a copy of that game? You don't think I've already played it? Kind of

38
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:58,069
annoying. I'm always one step ahead of you. Two steps forward. You're one step back. Two steps

39
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:15,319
forward. You're one step back. Nice beard. Oh, yeah. Why do you have film grain? This is there?

40
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:29,300
Oh, my God. This is actually huge. Hey, hey, I'm back, everybody. How's everybody doing?

41
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:35,459
Oh, yeah. Well, you know, I have a razor. You know, I haven't shaved and I haven't got it.

42
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:40,860
I haven't had a haircut either. I'm keeping it. I don't give a shit. I don't care. I'm just going

43
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:50,500
to grow. I'm going to grow till it's like this long. Fuck it. What do you think? Should I? Should

44
00:07:50,500 --> 00:08:03,509
I let it go? Should I just let it go like all the way? I'm going to start playing with fire on stream.

45
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:11,019
All right, let's go. You've waited long enough. You've waited over two and a half weeks.

46
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:19,420
I'm here now. How's everybody doing? This game apparently is you solve. It's randomly generated

47
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:30,470
cases. Seems pretty cool. I'm going to have to pay a lot of attention though. All right. Now,

48
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:36,539
italics told me do the tutorial and pay attention. He said, don't do this. Do not play this game if

49
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:42,200
you're not ready to put real brain power into this. He's like, you have to pay attention.

50
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,580
You have to know where the tools are. You have to know what to say. And then I asked him to repeat

51
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,259
that three more times before I understood. I wasn't really paying attention to what he was saying.

52
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:58,740
So, I'm ready. I know exactly what I'm getting into. I'm going to pay attention. I'm going to...

53
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:06,169
I promise I'm going to pay attention. Here we go. I'm ready. Can you guys even hear the game?

54
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:18,360
Oh, shit. Sorry. You guys mind if I turn the fan on? Why am I asking you? All right. Should I select

55
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:39,620
the city? Generate city or select city? For tutorial purposes. What is this? Okay. North

56
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:48,039
part Sapporo. Mercy. Okay. How about this one? This one looks good.

57
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,820
Is this like, do you guys have my, like, this is seed or something? You guys can play along? Cool.

58
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:11,879
This is going to crash my computer. What's my player's name? Okay. What do I look like?

59
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:31,139
I don't know. What should I put the... All right. Normal probably, right? You look disgruntled.

60
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,500
Should I just have my, like, just have my brow down the whole time? Just like,

61
00:10:41,639 --> 00:11:00,250
I look disgruntled. I think this... Wait. Gadget Lisenko. I think that's perfect.

62
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:16,120
We're good? Yo, that's my name. What the fuck? All right. Stop talking to me. I need to pay

63
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,679
attention. I'm serious. I need to, I have to pay attention. I need to pay attention. I need to pay

64
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:33,690
attention. I need to pay attention. Caveman Detective. Don't put ideas in my head.

65
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:52,779
Stop distracting me. You're doing it. I would need a pipe. A caveman outfit. Pay attention.

66
00:11:52,779 --> 00:12:02,730
Pay attention to what? It's just generating the seed. You are literally Willem Dafoe in

67
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:32,230
the lighthouse. Damn. I feel like I'm installing windows right now. This is going to be crazy.

68
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:50,330
Simulating past events? Wait. Look out for graffiti that may give clues about illegal businesses.

69
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:55,080
I should have been reading all of this. I know that most of you that have played this before

70
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,879
probably just like, this is basic, like, press tab to look at your inventory or whatever. But

71
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:07,700
I probably need to know this. All right. Everybody be quiet. In Shadows of Delta,

72
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:13,419
tutorial will guide you through how to use mechanics, though connecting the dots throughout

73
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:18,200
the cases on your shoulders, detective. Help can be accessed at any time through your detective

74
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:36,460
handbook. The main menu with F1. Turn it on. It is the late 20th century. Hyper industrialization

75
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:48,220
has swept the planet. The old urban empire has crumbled, giving way to the United Atlantic States

76
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:57,139
and the first elected mega corporation president in history, Starch Cola. You have a wicked slow

77
00:13:57,139 --> 00:14:10,070
computer? No, I don't. As sea levels rise, cities have become polluted islands. Workers dream of

78
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:22,950
escaping to the fields, an exclusive retirement district you will ever see. Rival corporations

79
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:31,100
have a power leased by the privatized Starch Cola enforcers. Okay, process it. Don't just read it.

80
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:41,450
Fuck, I'm doing it again. Some say justice now only exists in the shadows.

81
00:14:42,789 --> 00:15:01,210
I'm trying to pay attention. Stop distracting me over here. That is a doubt. The dead of night,

82
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:23,259
52 a.m. Tuesday, January 3rd, your apartment. That's probably good, right? That's much better.

83
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:45,269
Turn it up. So cold. Turn on the bedside light. Oh, okay. What? How did I? Why would I read this

84
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:52,169
right now? I'm not ready for this. I'm not ready for this info. It's too loud. Hold on. It's way

85
00:15:52,169 --> 00:16:11,000
too loud. I just can't get used to sleeping without what? He's just lying here. Get up. Oh,

86
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:24,309
turn on the light switch in the kitchen. Oh, there's like a little. This is a scary game.

87
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:39,129
It's locked. Jump. What's in there? What is this? Oh, this is a lot of reading this game. Hold on.

88
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:52,139
This is a Tennessee agreement drawn up between the landlord, Emer Jackson and me. Okay, this is my

89
00:16:52,139 --> 00:17:08,579
landlord. This is my apartment. Okay. Shit. All right. Hold on. Everybody relax. This Tennessee

93
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:35,990

98
00:17:58,569 --> 00:18:07,940
express permission to the landlord. Do I have any weapons? What's up? Where's somebody talking?

99
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:19,779
Oh, I thought someone was trying to get in. Let me continue reading this.

100
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:29,349
I got more info. Hold on. The tenant shall keep in good repair all walls, tiles, and flooring.

The tenant shall not encourage nor harbor pigeons, rodents, or microscopic life forms of any kind.

103
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:56,660
All right. It's a rental agreement of some kind. So don't break anything and make sure

104
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:02,700
you register with the landlord and building supervisor. I've just signed it. Okay. I guess.

105
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:21,529
Did I? Oh, all right. Let's go. Why do I need to know all this? What's that? What's this? Okay.

106
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:39,960
It's January. Oh, I can change the date by moving it. Oh, city directory. Yeah. That's a lot of

107
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:45,589
people. Let me just do what it's tell. I just stop overwhelming myself and just turn the light on.

108
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:52,680
That's it. Don't. Why am I doing? Why am I making this more complicated? When within range,

109
00:19:52,680 --> 00:20:03,210
possible interactions will be displayed at the bottom. Oh, hello.

110
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:39,539
Who's this? Ow. Why did somebody call me and hang up? What was that? All right. Search for clues.

111
00:20:40,099 --> 00:20:48,309
Former police officer's welfare association. We're here for you. Free basic housing for those in

112
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:55,700
need. For more information, contact Henry. Please note, we can no longer help with money. Wait,

113
00:20:56,859 --> 00:21:05,369
all. I call this person. There's a lot of, I don't have this person's phone number.

114
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:19,619
I don't know the telephone number. Call them the directory. Oh, yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. I don't know

115
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:37,029
why you would sprint across your house like that. Okay. Wait, shut up for a second. What's,

00:21:37,029 --> 00:22:08,859
hold on. What's the person's name? See you June three or rye. See you. All right. Wait, this is,

00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:22,710
I, this is their apartment. A lot of routes. Just go hang out. I just planned a route. Wait,

118
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:32,250
I can pin this. Whoa. Okay. So, all right. There's a note under the front door. That's not a front

119
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:44,779
door. Where's my front door? This is also not my front door. This is my front door. What is this?

120
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:48,779
When you inspect an item, it brings up its evidence window. This can be pinned to your

121
00:22:48,779 --> 00:23:03,509
case board for future reference using the pin at the top. Okay. So I can pin info. Got it. Thank

122
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:09,930
God I got a beard for today's stream. Pinned items are displayed as icons that you can move

123
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,369
around on the board by dragging their pin. You can position these items as you wish.

127
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:56,470
case board. Oh, shit. I fucked it all up. What happened? Close the case. Wait, what is this?

128
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:10,259
This is the case board, right? Isn't it pinned right now? These are all pinned. All right. Move

129
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:15,720
this out of the way. This is not, I need to find this person. Let me go look them up in the directory.

130
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:29,000
Never heard of them. If this is a job, it's a lousy way to do business. Yep. Okay. Look them up in the

131
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:49,079
directory. Okay. Pin to your case board. Whatever it is, I better go prepared. Find old detective

132
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:57,829
equipment. Oh, wait. Okay. That's map. You also have access to city district map that you can

133
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:04,539
toggle it up a little. Whatever. I missed it. What's the case board again? F? All right. I'm

134
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:17,019
starting. I'm getting it. I'm getting it. This is where I need to go. Find a route. We're heading

135
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:32,619
that way. Screwdriver. I'll take it. Exit inventory. Okay. I take snacks. It's still good.

136
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:46,220
Are they still good? I don't know. Why? Why did they let me throw that? Dish detergent. Okay. I

137
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:55,019
could use that. Give me some tissues. What's in the fridge? There's milk and there's a block of

138
00:25:55,019 --> 00:26:01,900
chicken. What about the freezer? That's all I need is a detective apparently, right? Wait.

139
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:14,630
Find all detective equipment. Synthetic milk. Synth milk. Oh, a wrench. Inventory's full.

140
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:31,259
What? How do I get to my inventory? I? How about open inventory again? X. Okay. Okay. Well, I don't

141
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:41,000
need this. So get rid of this. I, I gotta turn that down. It's awful. All right. I'm taking the

142
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:54,730
screwdriver, the milk, the chicken. Do I need anything else? The key to my old police stuff

143
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:59,369
was lost in the last move. I could pick the lock. There's got to be something I could use around

144
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:14,380
here. Look for hairpins or paper clips. What about the, I can use the wrench? I don't think I can.

145
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:25,930
It's money. Money can be used to buy items in the world. Acquire genetic upgrades for your character.

146
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:31,380
Pay for information. Decorate your apartment. Really? This is, oh, wait a minute. What's this?

147
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:44,230
Final notice open immediately. How do I open it? Final notice open immediately. So open it.

148
00:27:44,230 --> 00:28:12,549
This is a letter from me. Okay. I need to find, hold on. Let me do the tutorial. What? Oh, I got

149
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:36,299
Luigi. It took too long. Okay. Pick the lock. I need two of these. Why would I need two? Oh, wait.

150
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:58,250
7%. Did I open it? What happened? What did I just do? I need two. Oh, okay. What's that? Clean air

151
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:03,049
sunshine with every place and external space. Zone living areas for each family. Some opportunity

152
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:07,700
for individual expression. Fields for the happiest and best homes. Register your initial interest

153
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:29,769
today. Okay. Okay. Locked? Dude, this is my door. How am I locked in my own house? Hey, gadget.

154
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:40,279
I set the password back to 1234. Take care of yourself. This is my house. Password is 1234.

155
00:29:41,079 --> 00:30:07,930
Toothpaste. Toothbrush. God damn it. I need more room. Let me fix this right now. That's better.

156
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:20,119
Oh, a paper clip. Each lock has its own strength. When you start the, this game is actually pretty

157
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:26,140
cool. I'm very interested. When you start the process by interacting with the door handle or

158
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:30,859
lock, the indicated bars will tell you how many picks you need to complete the lock pick. Okay.

159
00:30:30,859 --> 00:30:40,630
So I need, would need three. You can also use lock picks to sabotage security systems. Okay.

160
00:30:40,630 --> 00:31:02,789
This is a very weird toilet. I should probably drop these, right? I'm just checking and just

161
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:24,710
making sure I don't miss anything. Okay. Let's go. Don't jump. Okay. Got it. Ooh. Okay. Yep.

162
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:33,990
The top group. Wait, I got to pay attention. Let me just take a step. The top group of items do not

163
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:41,099
take up inventory space. These are for your vital tools of the trade. The lower section features

164
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:48,410
slots. They can store other world items. So, okay. It's, I got it. Drop or scan picked up items for

165
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:57,319
fingerprints. Ooh, that's cool. Assign hotkeys. Press the hotkey by hovering and pressing. You

166
00:31:57,319 --> 00:32:13,829
guys just, just pay attention to this so I can ask you later. Okay. I got 30 lock picks. That was

167
00:32:13,829 --> 00:32:23,859
what was in that box. Okay. I got the key to my house. The password was pinned. Select the pin.

168
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:32,089
Yep. And then I already got it planned. Unlock the door to your apartment by interacting with

169
00:32:32,089 --> 00:32:50,680
the door. That's, that's the closet. Hello everybody. It's me, the detective. Here to

170
00:32:50,680 --> 00:33:02,150
hopefully solve another couple of cases. You be on your best behavior. Oh, I wasn't locked in my

171
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:18,779
room for 45 minutes. All right. I have to go. I can talk to. Unknown citizen, new information.

172
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:24,069
Evening. What's your name? Have you seen or heard anything unusual? Do you know this person?

173
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:30,630
Could you provide your fingerprints for an investor? Do you know this person?

174
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:39,640
I can't help you. Evening. What's your name? I'm Jarek Lean. What's it up to you?

175
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:57,369
You got any spare change? That guy just gave me money. Thank you. That guy gave me two bucks.

176
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:15,590
Uh, what's, what's that person? How do I, this person on the board. Oh, there it is. Okay.

177
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:31,179
How do I write like a note? Very, was very nice to me. Additional notes.

178
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:37,460
It was incredibly nice and gave me two dollars. Uh, I don't think we need to remember this person,

179
00:34:37,460 --> 00:35:02,199
but whatever. Is sprinting bad? This is locked. Somebody's coming to answer the door. Banker,

180
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:19,960
bar and grill? Is this a restaurant? Evening. How much for a tour of this place? Sure. I can

181
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:33,590
issue a temporary guest pass, but it'll cost you. How much? How much money do I have? Do you know

182
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:40,840
this person? I saw them today at Thompson House ground floor lobby around 2 15 a.m. Isn't that

183
00:35:40,840 --> 00:36:08,150
how it is right now? What's your name? I'm CEO young. He, what's it to you? What? Let's go.

184
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:26,139
Can I get in trouble? What is this place? It's a hospital. Am I allowed to be in here? I guess

185
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:37,670
it's just a hospital, right? Leave with the fire extinguisher. Yeah. Official police business. I

186
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:48,980
need to take this with me. Uh, how do I, what do we do with this though? Depending on your activity,

187
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:53,179
different kinds of status may affect your character. Oh, wait, something's wrong. What does

188
00:36:53,179 --> 00:37:09,800
that mean? What's that mean? Wet. Oh, I thought that meant I was in trouble. Why are you running?

189
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:25,000
I'm just like a fucking weirdo. All right. Let me go to 901 Royal Heights. Okay.

190
00:37:32,469 --> 00:37:50,230
They ain't coming back this time. Wait, is this a trash can or is that an ATM? You know, I'm going

191
00:37:50,230 --> 00:38:20,860
to have to take the plunger, right? Bists. I don't think we're ever going to get any. We're not

192
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:24,579
going to get anything done. I just want to make that really clear. I'm sorry, everybody. I don't

193
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:32,519
think we're going to solve one case. I got to, how do I put these down? Okay. I have to pay.

194
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:41,420
This is the tutorial. I can't fuck around. What's that? It's a battery. God, just draw. I need to

195
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:55,800
just go, just go up the stairs, please, man. Jim Stetter is a popular brand of beer brewed by the

196
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:29,480
starch cola corporation to prove drink responsibly. 12, uh, junk footprint. These are footprints

197
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:54,280
right here. How do I scan it? This is a different foot, size eight and a size six. What I've deduced

198
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:59,079
is that they have two different size feet. I don't know. I'm not sure what we're dealing with

199
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:34,519
here. What's up? Evening. What's your name? As if I tell you, okay. Um, I'll give you money for your

200
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:41,909
name. Do you know this person? It's not enough info for me to help you. I think it's your neighbor.

201
00:40:41,909 --> 00:41:14,409
Okay. Well, goodbye. Oh my, nevermind. I didn't know that could happen. Am I alive? Where even am I?

202
00:41:14,489 --> 00:41:31,380
I have a broken leg. I didn't know you could actually do that. I'm so fucked up right now.

203
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:35,380
I did not know. I thought there was an invisible barrier that didn't let me walk through it.

204
00:41:38,539 --> 00:42:03,769
We're only on the sixth floor. Where's the elevator? We need to go to floor number nine.

205
00:42:03,769 --> 00:42:25,159
I swear I didn't do that on purpose. It's so funny. You know, if a door is locked or not,

206
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:31,289
you must first have to try and open it. Lock doors can be unlocked by focusing on the door handle.

207
00:42:31,289 --> 00:42:36,150
You have the correct key for the door. You'll see an interaction open. Okay. So this is locked.

208
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:53,289
Doors locked. When breaking into a room, it's a good idea to check for cameras.

209
00:42:53,289 --> 00:42:56,329
If you're worried about them, you can turn them up by using the security breaker box

210
00:42:56,329 --> 00:43:38,260
connected to the camera. This person. Hold on. We need to listen. Hold on. Are they just,

211
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:58,760
are they just watching Nick at night? There's nobody in here. All right. Where's the camera?

212
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:04,150
Oh my God. What'd I just do? I thought that, I thought, how do I restart the game?

213
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:10,820
How do I restart the game? I don't want to sabotage this. That's an alarm. What is that?

214
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:27,300
I honestly, I, where's the breaker? This is like the alarm. I owe a hundred bucks to who?

215
00:44:29,269 --> 00:45:20,389
What was? Oh shit. Okay. Leave with air ducts. Hide under beds. How do I turn this off?

216
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:52,570
This is a good show. Antique vase. Bunch of shit. Hammer in here.

217
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:14,699
What? I'm drinking the whole carton. I'm going to puke. Put it down. Put it down. Put it down.

218
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:25,610
I'm just fucking this guy's whole apartment up. I drank, I drank soy milk in this person's

219
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:35,780
apartment until I puked. There's still more. Okay. I need to fucking settle down. Honest to

220
00:46:35,780 --> 00:47:10,010
goodness. You got cameras in here? Oh shit. My God. Unknown citizen, new information. Dead.

221
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:19,059
Dead. A bullet wound from low caliber aim. An eight millimeter nine by 32. Wait, pin that.

222
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:25,349
I'm examining the body. It appears that the victim has been shot to death with a pistol

223
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:34,730
or revolver. I can determine the time of death is between 2345 and one Tuesday, January 3rd.

224
00:47:34,730 --> 00:48:05,500
Pin this. Tall. Unknown citizen. Find a photo ID. I need a light. How do I turn the lights on?

225
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:21,539
Oh, internet works. Killian DeWitt. Wait, this is Killian DeWitt on the ground.

226
00:48:21,539 --> 00:48:43,289
Connect. Okay. Put that right here. Got it. Okay. This is Killian DeWitt. Killian DeWitt is dead.

227
00:48:43,289 --> 00:48:56,860
A sword. How do I pick up this? How do I use the sword? What's that? What does that mean? What was

228
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:10,519
that? What was that? Look around for a potential quick exit. Shit. I gotta pay attention. Vintage

229
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:32,550
sword. I don't, I don't know whose sword this is. I'm going to owe a thousand dollars. This is so,

230
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:45,539
this game's awesome. I'm like playing with all this guy's toys. Thank you for recently

231
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:51,639
life insurance policy. Do not meet the required social economic requirements to be approved.

232
00:49:51,639 --> 00:50:00,650
Check out a range of alternatives. Okay. There was, there was a insurance policy taken out.

233
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:31,559
How do I close this menu? Oh, right here. You can travel through buildings via ventilation ducts.

234
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:49,050
Simply open the grate. Okay. So did I, this is not what it wants me to do. Look around for vents.

235
00:50:49,050 --> 00:51:01,480
I just found it, right? It's still on my menu. I still have a broken leg. Is it the bathroom?

236
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:42,460
Just go in it. Okay. Well, I got info. Is it safe to go down here?

237
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:51,460
That's killing it. All right. Just search the place for clues. Well, why, why did I go through

238
00:51:51,460 --> 00:52:02,019
the vent? Okay. Hold on. Each citizen has a unique fingerprint. You can scan for them using the

239
00:52:02,019 --> 00:52:07,349
fingerprint scanner device in your inventory. Point the scanner where you want to scan. Almost

240
00:52:07,349 --> 00:52:13,900
all surfaces can contain fingerprints. Unknown fingerprints will be found in sets with set A

241
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:21,059
being the first you find any matching prints will also be labeled to that corresponding set.

242
00:52:21,059 --> 00:52:26,579
For example, if you find set A at an apartment and subsequently at a bar, you can prove a citizen

243
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:32,070
was in both locations at some point. Use right mouse button to inspect fingerprints after you

244
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:39,380
found them to pin them to your case board. They may disappear over time. Interesting.

245
00:52:39,380 --> 00:53:10,179
Somebody here? Look at the prints. Turn the lights off. Print writer, prints right there,

246
00:53:10,179 --> 00:53:17,860
right there. Look at that. This is Killian DeWitt's fingerprint. All right. Pin that

247
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:34,039
shit writer. Anything else? We're looking for other fingerprints. We don't know who this is.

248
00:53:34,039 --> 00:53:43,610
Okay. This is type B. We don't know who it belongs to. And that over here. Very, very cool.

249
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:51,059
Okay. These prints don't belong to Killian and nobody else lives here. That's the killer,

250
00:53:51,059 --> 00:54:17,449
obviously. Isn't it obvious? How do I turn this TV off? Drugs? No, it's an eraser. Is it an eraser?

251
00:54:17,449 --> 00:54:48,119
Just hit it with the sword. Coin? No, how do I hit this? Shut this TV off. I can't turn the TV off.

252
00:54:48,119 --> 00:55:23,099
Pour milk on it. 541-000. Last caller was telephone call. Pin that shit. 404-2676.

253
00:55:23,099 --> 00:56:05,719
We got it. I was like, oh, Gregory, huh? Shut this fucking TV off. Evening, what's your name?

254
00:56:05,719 --> 00:56:29,159
As if I'd tell. Have you seen or heard anything unusual? Shit. Please, no. Please, he begged us

255
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:34,730
and I flashed a light of the puncher. Please, you can have the promotion. I found the office chair

256
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:39,690
I tied him to. Uh-huh. I said, it is too late. You shouldn't have given the position to Jill.

257
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:45,179
Now you will pay. I shrieked, but I took a printout of last quarter's fiscal report.

258
00:56:45,179 --> 00:57:04,460
Stuffed it in his mouth. Who's underperforming now? Did he write this? Save, save, save. What?

259
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:35,739
What do you mean save? Oh my god. Yes. Italic said, for the record, I told him to ignore all

260
00:57:35,739 --> 00:57:40,630
the little detail things and just go punch people in the face. Chat, your job is to remind him to

261
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:46,309
save because I don't think there's an auto-save. Yeah, but I wanted to like, I wanted to understand

262
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:56,980
what I was doing, Italic. All right, what is this? I mean, it's connected to somebody.

263
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:13,539
Should I call all these phone numbers? Oh, this is a lot of people. Okay. Who is this? Get this

264
00:58:13,539 --> 00:58:24,199
person off my bar and get this off my bar too. What's the point of this? Get rid of this. Yeah,

265
00:58:24,199 --> 00:58:35,690
I already did. Get rid of this. I need to clean this up, by the way. Fingerprint right here,

266
00:58:36,250 --> 00:59:01,559
put the address here. All right. Why is this so weird? I still have a broken leg. Search for

267
00:59:01,559 --> 00:59:10,309
clues at the crime scene. All right, we got some clues. What's that? What's in there? What's this?

268
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:27,260
Oh, safe. Locked. Keypad. We need a four-digit key. Do I have any? What do you got here?

269
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:40,579
Doctor's prescription. Okay, this is the doctor that prescribed this. High blood pressure. All

270
00:59:40,579 --> 00:59:53,340
right. You. We're calling you. Wait, I want to pin that. Here's the connection. Prescription

271
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:57,400
from this doctor. We're going to call this doctor. You sound like a tuber right now.

272
00:59:58,789 --> 01:00:14,250
I'll settle down. I'll settle down. New policy, dear. Okay, do it. Thank you for recently contacting

273
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:24,380
us to request a life insurance. Oh, I already did this one. Pin it anyways. Okay. Sometimes

274
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:31,619
it's useful to search the trash. This is crumpled up. Receipt key for tax records. Banker, bar,

275
01:00:31,619 --> 01:00:47,449
and grill. Call me. Not paid. Wait. I knocked on this door. So I have a tab. Well, I don't have a

276
01:00:47,449 --> 01:01:11,110
tab. Killian Dewitt has a tab. Can that make that connection? Tape. A little used device containing

277
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:39,050
magnetic tape to store moving images and sounding. Okay. Okay. So code breaker. Bug on the floor?

278
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:50,869
What's wrong with me? What's wrong? What's wrong with my character? What's wrong with me? I have

279
01:01:50,869 --> 01:02:17,190
a code breaker now. What am I doing? Watch this. Uh oh. Why am I shaking? Commemorative baseball?

280
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:31,960
Take this vial to a local sync clinic to upgrade one of your installed sync disks. And then what's

281
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:47,320
this? The menace of charity. What is wrong with me? Honestly, what's going on? That's a lot of

282
01:02:47,320 --> 01:03:13,820
money. That's a $10,000 fine. I don't have that money. So can I sleep? Can I sleep this off? Oh,

283
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:28,599
what the hell? Don't forget who owns you. Okay. A bandage. Oh, hold on. I need that. I don't need

284
01:03:28,599 --> 01:03:52,469
this. I need this though. Use it right now on my leg. Can I just eat the bandage? Remember your pass

285
01:03:52,469 --> 01:04:09,590
code this time? Oh, God damn it. I just wasted that code breaker. Okay. I need to go to the hospital

286
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:31,739
now. This is kind of giving me a headache. I'm puking into the trash. I just puked in it.

287
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:41,929
Let me get my hands in there now. Key for tax records. Okay. Coffee. Hamburger. I went to the

288
01:04:41,929 --> 01:04:50,730
turkey sandwich bar. Apparently this guy's eating food. Very cool. Okay. This is just a receipt.

289
01:04:50,809 --> 01:05:06,179
The silent alarm has been tripped. It means what? Oh, how do I get under the bed? The dot in the

290
01:05:06,179 --> 01:05:11,219
middle of the screen displays how hidden you are. A hollow circle means you are completely obscured

291
01:05:11,219 --> 01:05:15,030
and others will only notice you if you get extremely close. Filled in circle means you're

292
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:24,500
completely visible. Okay. So that means something can see you. When things go wrong, you might have

293
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:33,380
to resort to combat. Punch or block, but be careful detective. Violence can escalate quickly.

294
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:40,250
How do I get under the bed? How do I get under the bed? It told me to, I said I could get under the

295
01:05:40,250 --> 01:06:30,579
bed. Is a vent in this room? Oh, fuck. I, where'd I go? That was, that was weird, right? It looked

296
01:06:30,579 --> 01:06:59,510
like I fell through the world. Where am I? Am I even inside of this thing? I think they're gone.

297
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:40,710
I think they're gone. Just walked out the fucking front door. All right, we're good. How do I get

298
01:07:40,710 --> 01:08:15,210
out of here? Out the window? Oh shit. You can do that? I'm dead. I, what happened? What? I didn't,

299
01:08:15,210 --> 01:08:25,930
what just happened? What? Am I alive? What? Am I, am I down here now? What just happened?

300
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:30,979
Oh, I clipped through the door. Oh, okay. Well, I'm just kind of bleeding out.

301
01:08:30,979 --> 01:08:37,220
I gotta get to the hospital right now. I stink too, apparently. I smells. I have so, all right.

302
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:43,189
This is like in The Sims when you have like three or four different families and you just, or like

303
01:08:43,189 --> 01:08:47,350
there's like five people in the household and just one of them you've just neglected for like an hour

304
01:08:47,350 --> 01:08:56,579
and you don't even realize it. I am fucked up right now. Bleeding, stinky, broken leg. Okay.

305
01:08:56,579 --> 01:09:12,819
Let's just go get out of here. Why am I walking by the way?

306
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:50,460
Oh my God. There's so much blood. There is so much blood. How do I get rid of this trail?

307
01:09:50,460 --> 01:10:03,909
Collect a murder case resolution form from city hall. I need to, uh, I'm in, I'm hurt. I need to,

308
01:10:03,909 --> 01:10:17,739
where's the doctor? I need a doctor. What's this? A cola. Is there anything left in it? Come on,

309
01:10:17,739 --> 01:10:46,250
let me have a couple of little scraps. Where's the hospital? Am I picking this shit up? I'm just,

310
01:10:46,970 --> 01:11:10,390
what am I doing? Where's the hospital? I'm sorry. I can't play this game. Where's the hospital? How

311
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:24,920
do I control the map? Cause like, I can't move it from here. Wait. Okay. Over here. Here's the clinic.

312
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:31,609
Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I need quite a few things. I need you. I need a,

313
01:11:31,609 --> 01:11:45,539
I need a splint for my leg. I need a, um, money in front of me. Hello. Hi. Um, I'd like to buy

314
01:11:45,539 --> 01:12:26,680
something. I'd like a splint please. Thank you. Okay. Uh, what about all the blood? I want to take

315
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:59,430
it so bad. Bandage. I don't have any. Hold on. I'm bleeding everywhere. What handcuffs, sink, disc,

316
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:14,220
upgrade vial. Get rid of the baseball. I'm, hold on. Wait, can I get in the, wait, can I, can you,

317
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:50,069
I need treatment. Installing a disc. I don't have anything to do. I don't have anything to upgrade.

318
01:13:50,069 --> 01:14:16,140
Okay. I am good to go now. I get this. Potential crime. All employees, the door code to my office

319
01:14:16,140 --> 01:15:08,460
has been reset to 1608. Save, save, save. All right. All right. I got it. I got it. Perfect

320
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:19,720
lightning strike. What did I pick up? I picked up something else. Wait, whose blood is this?

321
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:47,189
What did I pick up? Okay. Collect a murder case resolution form. Where do I get it? City hall.

322
01:15:47,189 --> 01:15:55,079
Oh, right here. Okay. Collected form. Got a resolution form. View your case objective

323
01:15:55,079 --> 01:16:02,979
by using the resolve button in the top right of the case board screen. Resolve the case.

324
01:16:02,979 --> 01:16:08,300
Provide answers for the following before plotting a route to the hand in destination. What is the

325
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:13,640
full name of the killer? Do you have any evidence to place the killer at the crime scene? Okay. Wait,

326
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:28,600
wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay. I got it. I got it. I got it. Juniper networks and the doctor too.

327
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:37,369
Check out the sandwich bar. I have a, I got it on the board. We don't need to do this yet.

328
01:16:37,369 --> 01:16:45,850
I am going to go, go to the work. Okay. Juniper networks. Let's plan a route and we're going to

329
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:54,819
scan for fingerprints. We're looking for that one. Game is sick. It's really fun. In shadows of

330
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:58,579
doubt, there are almost always multiple ways to carry out an investigation. Here are the current

331
01:16:58,579 --> 01:17:02,579
available leads. Choose one as a star to be guided through. Remember in the main game, you'll have

332
01:17:02,579 --> 01:17:07,560
to think for yourself, detective. In addition, due to the simulated nature of the game, some leads

333
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:11,720
could be dead ends. It's just part of the job. If you think you have enough information to solve

334
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:21,189
the case, fill in the resolution form. Okay. Investigate the office, diner, or phone calls.

335
01:17:21,189 --> 01:17:32,199
Should I just disable this or no? I think I'm going to do the diner. Okay. So we'll go into the

336
01:17:32,199 --> 01:18:05,529
turkey sandwich place. Let's go find this out. Am I still bleeding? Didn't I just steal from you?

337
01:18:05,529 --> 01:18:12,939
Oops. Bro, you stink. Take a shower. I tried to take a shower earlier. It wouldn't let me.

338
01:18:12,939 --> 01:18:53,060
The camera's too big. All right. Let's go check this out. What's going on? Commercial properties

339
01:18:53,060 --> 01:19:03,539
contain a wealth of information and probably usually I, huh. Okay. All right. So I'm going

340
01:19:03,539 --> 01:19:34,119
to take the kettle off the stove, please. Fingerprint type C. What about this one? Doesn't match.

341
01:19:36,500 --> 01:20:14,579
Type D. Check the booth. Type E. Type F. We're looking for B. Wait, I can eat? I should do that

342
01:20:14,579 --> 01:20:39,050
right now. How do I sit down? Okay. Only his fingerprints were on this. So this thing is

343
01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:53,909
useless to me. Can I sell it to somebody? Is he still the tutorial? Yeah. This tutorial is a long

344
01:20:53,909 --> 01:20:59,500
tutorial. It's designed to make it so you, it's, I'm learning the game. We'll do another one.

345
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:09,899
Let's talk. Let's figure this out. What's your name? Mind your own business. Okay. Have you

346
01:21:09,899 --> 01:21:19,050
seen anything unusual? No. Do you know this person? I saw them somewhere around Royal Heights. Okay.

347
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:30,810
Checks out. Checks out. Did you provide your fingerprints for an investigation?

348
01:21:30,810 --> 01:22:02,680
Didn't even do anything. I just put two bucks in here. Ooh, fingerprints. Let's go for it.

349
01:22:02,680 --> 01:23:23,479
This place is filthy. Am I just, oh, sentry gun. It's okay. We're good. Okay. I gotta hurry up.

350
01:23:23,479 --> 01:24:08,760
Why would there be a sentry gun leading over here? How do I turn this off? M. Toilet paper. What's

351
01:24:08,760 --> 01:25:03,500
this? What is that? We're going to the bathroom. I gotta check this thing for fingerprints. Oh,

352
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:19,270
we need B. Oh my God. Why did I think this was an office? I just, I'm sneaking into the public

353
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:25,130
bathrooms. I'm sneaking into the public bathrooms. Like, oh, I gotta find my way over here. Disable

354
01:25:25,130 --> 01:25:30,010
the security cam. Oh, the alarm system. This is literally just the public bathroom of this

355
01:25:30,010 --> 01:25:40,090
restaurant. This is just the bathroom. This is the bathrooms. There's nothing even back here.

356
01:25:40,729 --> 01:25:57,939
Why did I disable all these things? I thought this is somebody's office. Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

357
01:25:57,939 --> 01:26:25,109
Wait, nobody in there. Okay. We're good. Come on. I'm in here. Dude, he, and we're behind the

358
01:26:25,109 --> 01:26:41,460
counter. Perfect. Okay. So let's go ahead and what's that? The note. I was in the stall. All

359
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:51,640
right. So I got, will you talk to me? Health inspector. I need to survey your premises.

360
01:26:51,640 --> 01:27:03,689
Health inspector, huh? Still going to need a guest pass to take a look around. Okay. All right. I'm

361
01:27:03,689 --> 01:27:10,140
paying it. Your guest pass is active for two hours. After that, you'll need to leave or pay someone

362
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:23,300
for more time. There it is. The door code to my office. Seven two nine zero. Let's go ahead.

363
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:42,020
Okay. Got it. Seven two nine zero. Hurry up. I don't have much time. Oops. Fingerprints. Quick.

364
01:27:57,300 --> 01:28:22,300
Club sign up below. No, none of you. Wait, who are these people? Waitstaff. Waitstaff. Okay.

365
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:37,819
Just get, I'm getting names down here. Did I pin any of these? Urban? No. No. Janitor. Waitstaff.

366
01:28:37,899 --> 01:28:47,909
Waitstaff. Retail owner. Waitstaff. And waitstaff. All right. I just learned a bunch of people's names.

367
01:28:48,550 --> 01:29:03,020
Can't get in here. Seven two nine zero. How do I get in here without them being pissed that I'm

368
01:29:03,020 --> 01:29:15,239
doing this though? Can I go in here? Is everyone getting mad at me? Can I do this? Just in case.

369
01:29:15,239 --> 01:29:19,880
I know I'm allowed to be back here to be the health inspector, but it seems like off limits to me.

370
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:34,420
Seven two nine zero. Hunters are digital personal computation devices. They're common in most

371
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:39,220
apartments and white collar workplaces. If you know a citizen's passcode you can log into their

372
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:45,899
account. Really? Once logged in you'll be able to access vmails which are personal or work related

373
01:29:45,899 --> 01:29:50,300
sent between citizens. You also build access a variety of other apps including security and

374
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:55,420
surveillance as well as employee databases. If you find useful evidence on a micro cruncher,

375
01:29:55,420 --> 01:30:04,140
don't forget to print it using the on-screen print button. Okay. I don't have very much time so let's

376
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:36,600
go. First things first. Open the breaker box. Ah somebody was just in here. Camera. Yeah the

377
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:41,260
tutorial said hey open the breaker box. I was just doing what it told me. I don't know it's weird.

378
01:30:41,260 --> 01:31:42,180
Somebody was in here. Did I do it? All right I need this info. CCTV cameras have two functions

379
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:47,319
to alert instance of security threat but actually capture surveillance still throughout the day.

380
01:31:47,319 --> 01:31:59,260
Ooh okay. So I'm looking for somebody that was in here with this with this dude right? How can

381
01:31:59,260 --> 01:32:39,659
me look like you just got back from Survivor? Okay 22 45 Monday. 22 40 22 45 Monday. How do I

382
01:32:39,659 --> 01:33:08,010
change the time? Okay hold on. How do I do time? Oh 22 sitting with somebody. Open an evidence

383
01:33:08,010 --> 01:33:36,439
window by inspecting their mugshot. No! Shit! Okay you were there and so were you. All right.

384
01:33:36,439 --> 01:34:06,890
Interesting. What were you doing there? Interesting. Where are you? Lawrence Champion. Janitor. I gotta

385
01:34:06,890 --> 01:34:20,779
talk to the janitor. Open an evidence window by inspecting the mugshot. Didn't I just do that? I

386
01:34:20,779 --> 01:34:50,859
didn't just do that. I need to click on. Oh this guy just doesn't care that I'm in here. No I gotta

387
01:34:50,859 --> 01:34:56,520
I gotta track down this person here because you have the guest pass. I was freaking out for no

388
01:34:56,520 --> 01:35:09,899
reason. All right so I need to figure out who that person is. So I think I'm all right now.

389
01:35:09,899 --> 01:35:26,500
So it was the janitor. Janitor. There it is. Okay there you are. Janitor. Are you here now?

390
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:42,090
Where's the janitor? Uh do you know this person? I work with them. That's Lawrence Champion.

391
01:35:42,090 --> 01:35:53,579
Loves coffee. Saw them today at McCarthy Street around 7 a.m. To a nearby Butler Street at itself.

392
01:35:56,710 --> 01:36:07,029
Okay thank you. Butler Street? So down that way. You didn't do the PC thing correctly?

393
01:36:07,670 --> 01:36:24,890
What did I do wrong? Surveillance. Go to the right time on Monday. Oh I have to print it. Right right

394
01:36:24,890 --> 01:36:55,060
right. Wait a minute. Print this. Got it. There it is. There it is. Use a different camera. Who's that?

395
01:36:55,060 --> 01:37:35,260
What are you doing over here? Print that. And that too. Who's that? I got it. Are you pissed that I

396
01:37:35,260 --> 01:37:47,140
tried to pick up your burnt cigarette? I think I'm good. You missed the girl. Well somebody was a

397
01:37:47,140 --> 01:37:59,590
just a wait staff. It wasn't. Yeah this this is the wait staff right? I don't think this person is

398
01:37:59,590 --> 01:38:09,850
a person of interest. No I got what I need. Oh I just want to go back. I don't want. Come on.

399
01:38:09,850 --> 01:38:25,180
Store room. I got that one. Back room. Nothing. No no I got it. I got it right here. So where do

400
01:38:25,180 --> 01:38:34,789

401
01:38:34,789 --> 01:39:09,449
don't even care. No the other camera. The only footage of the. Wait who's this? Unknown. Print

402
01:39:09,449 --> 01:39:31,609

403
01:39:31,609 --> 01:39:45,239
find out who you are. It's a paper jam. Dude you are so smart. It's a complicated game and it's fun.

404
01:39:45,239 --> 01:39:56,069
Okay good. I think that is free. Fuck. I was just checking it. I didn't even check it. I had to

405
01:39:56,069 --> 01:40:05,239
check it for fucking prints. I forgot I was on. Didn't I disable the camera? Are they checking the

406
01:40:05,239 --> 01:40:19,659
footage right now? Too bad it's not anymore ink. Whatever I got 25 bucks. They don't care. All

407
01:40:19,659 --> 01:40:28,260
right I need to talk to some people. Do you know who this is? Do you know this person? I saw them

408
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:43,319
somewhere around Little Parks. Interesting. Little Parks. Thank you. Appreciate it. What about you?

409
01:40:43,319 --> 01:40:54,970
Have you seen this person? Little Parks. Where's Little Parks? How do I zoom the map out? Anybody

410
01:40:54,970 --> 01:41:20,069
know? That's Kilian Dewitt's fingerprints on a crumpled piece of paper. Starting soon in Mercia

411
01:41:20,069 --> 01:41:25,909
district anonymous work will come and share the load. Buy like turkey sandwich bar. Go to this

412
01:41:25,909 --> 01:41:39,930
Kilian. You'll feel better for it. Tell them Rio Takahashi sent you. Can they print on this table?

413
01:41:44,649 --> 01:42:20,390
E. Find Rio Takahashi. Okay. Hey there you are. Let's go. He's not gonna find shit. What? I have

414
01:42:20,390 --> 01:42:41,140
pretty good leads right now. A sugar daddy? Okay. Sugar daddy or cola? I want a cola. Just throw

415
01:42:41,140 --> 01:43:02,220
the baseball at this point. I don't want it. Can't even walk down the darn street anymore.

416
01:43:07,779 --> 01:43:39,050
Okay. Let's go. I knew it was you. Anything unusual? Do you know this person? Little Parks.

417
01:43:39,050 --> 01:44:09,239
Okay. Thanks for your help. Where does this person live? Sixth floor? Are they gonna let me in?

418
01:44:09,239 --> 01:44:29,159
Cameras. Okay. I gotta play this well. I'm on camera right here. Here we go. This could be

419
01:44:29,159 --> 01:45:21,460
the killer. I have to be prepared. Good evening. Look who it is. Look who it is. Ask you a few

420
01:45:21,460 --> 01:45:33,180
questions. Excuse me. What is your name? I'm Rio Takahashi. What's it to you? Anything unusual

421
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:48,630
over the last few days? Nothing. Mind if I take a look around? You're welcome to. Come on in. Hey.

422
01:45:48,630 --> 01:45:56,619
Hey, be careful. There's a killer out there. Did you provide your fingerprints for an investigation?

423
01:45:57,609 --> 01:46:13,100
I guess if it's for an investigation. Fingerprints. What kind of fingerprints are they?

424
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:26,170
Shit. I was not done with my investigation. You said I could come in. Can I still come in?

425
01:46:27,859 --> 01:46:51,590
Thank you. Reuben sandwich, hamburger, pepper, beer, vodka bourbon. Interesting. Interesting.

426
01:46:51,590 --> 01:47:01,159
What a place you have here. Sorry. Do you like the detective routine in every television show?

427
01:47:03,369 --> 01:47:06,329
Holy shit. I just, I just hit the absolute jackpot here. What do you have?

428
01:47:07,609 --> 01:47:29,640
You've got beef bricks. Can I cook it? I think they're brushing their teeth.

429
01:47:31,319 --> 01:47:44,460
Okay. Work. Accountant. 900 to 700. Monday through Friday. I don't know what that means,

430
01:47:44,460 --> 01:48:02,659
but it's, I am just going to put it over here. This is another person. Who are you? Who are you?

431
01:48:02,659 --> 01:48:09,699
Who are you? Are you another person? Oh, wait. How? That was, I thought you went this way.

432
01:48:09,699 --> 01:48:35,060
Burger sandwiches. Okay. So all this proves is that you were at the restaurant. What about

433
01:48:35,060 --> 01:49:12,619
fingerprints? Looking for B, right? Maybe you know who it is. You might fucking busy in here.

434
01:49:12,619 --> 01:49:23,590
Okay. Can we have a compromise? Can I turn on one light? Why does this, why do you not want

435
01:49:23,590 --> 01:49:42,329
any lights on in your entire house? How do you navigate this apartment? What time is it? It's

436
01:49:42,329 --> 01:50:06,859
10 30. Barbecue sauce. Shit. This doesn't prove anything. I'm at a dead end. Actual dead end.

437
01:50:06,859 --> 01:50:22,520
I thought that was an animal. I'm so jumpy today too. Wait, why am I still allowed in the house?

438
01:50:24,659 --> 01:50:40,489
What? So can I like break into that safe? What's going on? What's happening? What's happening?

439
01:50:40,489 --> 01:50:53,529
What's happening? What's happening? Hey, who the fuck are you? Oh, you think the darkness is your

440
01:50:53,529 --> 01:51:11,939
ally. Where am I? Who is this person? Who is this person? Oh no. Okay. I didn't do anything.

441
01:51:12,340 --> 01:51:31,579
I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. Citizen's arrest. What? After two hours?

442
01:51:31,579 --> 01:51:51,930
What do I do? Okay. You're under. What do you mean? Huh? Do you see what just happened in here?

443
01:51:51,930 --> 01:52:01,479
I guess, I guess if it's for an investigation. Fingerprints. What were they? These things hurt.

444
01:52:01,479 --> 01:52:13,289
All right. What do you got on you in that shit? Who are you? Take their money and take their keys.

445
01:52:13,289 --> 01:52:21,770
Yeah. Take it. I'm, I'm freaking out. Hold on. I gotta calm down. Who are you and what are you?

446
01:52:21,770 --> 01:52:33,640
Automatic pistol. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Turn the lights on first of all. Um, um,

447
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:43,899
fingerprint. Yes. What's the fingerprint though? Is it B? Got you. You're under arrest. You're

448
01:52:43,899 --> 01:52:58,409
under arrest for killing at least two people. Um, what do we do? Okay. How do I follow me down

449
01:52:58,409 --> 01:53:05,029
the stairs? The victim has been shot to death with a pistol. I'm at death between 10 and 1045. I was

450
01:53:05,029 --> 01:53:15,479
in the room. All right. How do I, what do I do? Is there a way I can, I can take you with me?

451
01:53:15,479 --> 01:53:25,960
Just leave them there. Okay. What is the full name of the killer?

452
01:53:25,960 --> 01:53:36,869
Right here. Arrest the killer. Yes. Do you have evidence that placed the killer at the crime scene?

453
01:53:36,869 --> 01:53:43,300
I do. I'm standing at it right now. I'm standing at the crime scene. This has been a murder.

454
01:53:43,300 --> 01:54:01,340
The fingerprints. Yep. Where's the fingerprints? Right here. Where does the killer live? I don't

455
01:54:01,340 --> 01:54:12,359
know. Wasn't it on the, wait, I know. Uh, what was that? The thing I, I took the wallet. No, no, no,

456
01:54:12,359 --> 01:54:26,229
stuff, stuff, stuff right here. And that I want to take the money out of this person's wallet.

457
01:54:26,229 --> 01:54:45,770
Wait, I've got so much bullshit everywhere. Like arrest. Have you located the murder weapon? I've

458
01:54:45,770 --> 01:54:53,609
got it. It's a gun, but I need to look at it again because I didn't pin it. Search them again.

459
01:54:53,609 --> 01:55:06,260
Okay. Pin this. There we go. Here it is. Flot route to hand in. All right. You come with me.

460
01:55:06,260 --> 01:55:26,310
Arrest. You're under arrest. It's closed. That was crazy. That was really, really crazy. Do I

461
01:55:26,310 --> 01:55:39,560
actually have to walk with them or do I just turn it in? You just leave? I was in the, what was I

462
01:55:39,560 --> 01:55:44,409
even doing in the other room? I'm okay. That was too much stimulation. I'm just going to go turn

463
01:55:44,409 --> 01:56:02,819
this in. It was a box to check arrest. You didn't take it. No, no, no. I, no, I got it. Arrest.

464
01:56:02,819 --> 01:56:14,819
Right here. I got it. Yeah. I got it. I got it. I got it. No, it checked. All right. Let's turn it

465
01:56:14,819 --> 01:56:32,949
in. That was crazy. That was really cool though. That was fun. The thing we, honestly, we just got

466
01:56:32,949 --> 01:56:44,439
into a random scenario. There is no connection between this person killing Killian. We have no

467
01:56:44,439 --> 01:56:58,149
connection. We just were in the room when another person died. Just caught him red handed. Fingerprint.

468
01:56:58,149 --> 01:57:06,760
That's true. Yeah, that's true. You're right. Okay. Let's go for it. Tutorial officially complete.

469
01:57:06,760 --> 01:57:34,300
I think I understand how the game works. I thought I was getting shot at. Okay. Case submitted for

470
01:57:34,300 --> 01:57:58,100
processing. Please wait for the results. I got five out of five. I got it. One assistant. I got

471
01:57:58,100 --> 01:58:25,829
250 social credit. 2200 bucks. Social credit level up. Cool. Now what? I did it. Now you can

472
01:58:25,829 --> 01:58:44,619
change your name. Change my name. Do I now just, do I get rid of all this now too? This is all

473
01:58:44,619 --> 01:59:00,810
not active anymore. Upright. Archive closed. Oh, cool. So this has been resolved. Uh, close the

474
01:59:00,810 --> 01:59:07,210
case. You can take a side quest now or wait for another murder. Really? I can't close it at this

475
01:59:07,210 --> 01:59:26,489
moment. Why not? You don't have to wait for a murder. Murder someone then frame someone else.

476
01:59:27,130 --> 01:59:39,380
I have to go back to the apartment. There's still more. Like this apartment? Wait, which apartment?

477
01:59:40,020 --> 02:00:14,010
Fine. This is a mess. I know it is. Sit on your bench with your watch out. It's locked. How do I

478
02:00:14,010 --> 02:00:18,739
just, where even is my house? Just start a new sandbox game at this point. The game gets glitchy

479
02:00:18,739 --> 02:00:26,659
and dead of night after the murder. Okay. That makes sense to me. All right. So sandbox. Solve

480
02:00:26,659 --> 02:00:42,489
and explore within the city your way. Generate a city. And Franklin's fine. Medium's fine. And

481
02:00:42,489 --> 02:01:00,100
let's do random. The game should be, did you even save? Yeah, I did. Okay. Seems pretty good. Let's

482
02:01:00,100 --> 02:01:10,220
go. Yeah. Uh, did I get one guide? I may have, but they said it was, um, one guy said that sometimes

483
02:01:10,220 --> 02:01:26,310
it can bug out after that case. Shadows of doubt. One guy is actually correct. Okay. That was fun.

484
02:01:26,310 --> 02:01:37,449
This game's giving me a migraine. Can you please turn off all the lights and watch videos of fish?

485
02:01:37,449 --> 02:01:53,449
I'm sorry. I mean, I do enjoy videos of fish, but not right now. Give me one day. How big do

486
02:01:53,449 --> 02:02:05,239
you think I can get this? So sandbox mode, something just happens and I have to figure it out.

487
02:02:16,279 --> 02:02:32,819
Shave your face, you cretin. I'm going to try to look as gross as I can. You know what I mean?

488
02:02:34,569 --> 02:02:43,720
I've never tried that before. You know, it always hits, it always hits a time when I haven't had a

489
02:02:43,720 --> 02:02:47,640
haircut in a while. I haven't shaved in a while and I'm like, okay, all right. It's time to clean

490
02:02:47,640 --> 02:02:54,489
up a little. Um, I think, I don't know. I just think, what if I just, just let it all go and

491
02:02:54,569 --> 02:03:01,699
just, let's see what happens after like a month, two months. No, like I'm going to get a trim and

492
02:03:01,699 --> 02:03:11,939
clean it up. No, no. Eyebrows. Just go for it and see what happens. Right now. Holly is probably

493
02:03:11,939 --> 02:03:25,289
sitting there going like, okay, yeah, let me just look like fucking crazed. Uh, no tutorial. I just

494
02:03:25,289 --> 02:03:45,979
turned it on. I thought it said no. I am fucking out of my mind. Can I, I seriously thought it

495
02:03:45,979 --> 02:04:14,090
said no. It's all right. I could probably still use them. Jumpster. Crash. What's in it? Evening.

496
02:04:14,649 --> 02:04:53,689
Evening. Sorry. Nothing. Don't worry about it. I just, I was trying to investigate. Hacking tape.

497
02:04:53,689 --> 02:04:59,300
By default, they will be reported murder. Where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where?

498
02:05:02,949 --> 02:05:11,739
New murder case. Crime scene. 1001 gray building. You also have access to a city district map that

499
02:05:11,739 --> 02:05:23,779
you have toggle up with. Where is it? 1001 gray building. Use the map with F.

500
02:05:31,689 --> 02:05:42,550
There we go. That's what I was looking for. Okay. Gray building. 1001 gray building. Is that a name

501
02:05:42,550 --> 02:06:02,279
of street or the name of a building? I can use this search. Wait, the color. No, it's not. Context

502
02:06:02,279 --> 02:06:29,159
menu. Search top left. Gray. Oh, there it is. We get out of the way. As you know, there's been a

503
02:06:29,159 --> 02:06:38,340
murder. Depending on your activity, different kinds of status. Yep. Yep. Yep. I already know

504
02:06:38,340 --> 02:07:04,039
that. All right. What happened? Where are you? Where are you going? 10th floor. Let's go. I don't

505
02:07:04,039 --> 02:07:28,760
know what happened there. Sound the alarm. Sound the alarm. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here, detective.

506
02:07:28,760 --> 02:07:46,890
I'm here. I'm a detective. Open it up. Sound the alarm. I'm here. How do I open the door? I did.

507
02:07:48,329 --> 02:07:56,119
You need to get out of there. What do you mean? No. I, how do I turn it off? I don't know what,

508
02:08:00,649 --> 02:08:06,729
what do I do? I don't know what to do. I don't know what happened. What's going on? What's going on?

509
02:08:06,729 --> 02:08:13,300
What's going on? Help. Help. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off.

510
02:08:15,880 --> 02:08:23,899
Ah! What the fuck? What's happening? What? It's the killer. That's the killer. That's the killer

511
02:08:23,899 --> 02:08:31,029
right there. There's a killer. There's a killer. There's a killer. Stop this guy.

512
02:08:43,539 --> 02:08:53,800
Shotgun. I don't understand what just happened. I'm so confused. I saw his face. I know what he

513
02:08:53,800 --> 02:09:05,220
looks like. He's bald and he's got glasses. I know. That dude shot me point blank like 10 times.

514
02:09:05,220 --> 02:09:10,920
He's bald and he's got glasses. I'm going, I know, I know what he looks like. Medical fees.

515
02:09:12,920 --> 02:09:22,500
Get the fuck out of here. Don't you understand? There's a killer on the loose.

516
02:09:31,420 --> 02:09:51,029
All right. Where is this guy? I'm going back there. Have any food? I'll take whatever you got.

517
02:09:51,590 --> 02:10:20,060
How do I buy something? I need, I need the hospital right now. No. God damn it. I just like alt tab.

518
02:10:20,060 --> 02:10:38,060
There we go. Where is the hospital? Hospital. Doctor. Drugstore. Come on. Come on. Come on. Hurry

519
02:10:38,060 --> 02:10:43,579
up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Go, go, go, go, go. Why is it? What's going on?

520
02:10:43,579 --> 02:11:23,989
Where'd it go? Hey, bandage. Where's all my money? Medical fees? What are you talking about? I had

521
02:11:23,989 --> 02:11:34,659
2200 bucks five minutes ago. That was a different save file. Oh, that's actually awful. Shit. Okay.

522
02:11:35,979 --> 02:11:55,289
Now that's why I shouldn't have left. Shit. Um, am I actually screwed here? Or if I just reload

523
02:11:55,289 --> 02:12:18,039
this, will it fix it? Just rob the medicine cabinet. I guess I could fuck off with this.

524
02:12:18,039 --> 02:12:39,770
Oh, you got like trophies back here. Where's this? Where's the medicine? What time is this?

525
02:12:39,770 --> 02:12:48,859
I'm just going to start over. That got so screwed up. I went there. There's somebody screaming at

526
02:12:48,859 --> 02:12:52,859
me. Turn the alarm on. I turn the alarm on. A guy with a shotgun shoots me five times in the face

527
02:12:52,859 --> 02:13:15,340
and then I get up. I think I'm just going to restart. I'm just going to restart. You're a

528
02:13:15,340 --> 02:13:26,310
bigger public menace than the murderer. Okay. Let's try this again. That was that. That one

529
02:13:26,310 --> 02:13:38,779
actually doesn't count. Sorry. I'm so jumpy. That was kind of a mess though. Give me a little bit

530
02:13:38,779 --> 02:13:51,380
of slack. So in conclusion, you trespassed, started breaking a fire alarm, got shot, ran from the

531
02:13:51,380 --> 02:13:59,850
hospital, robbed a drug store and gave up. There was somebody behind the screen screaming for me,

532
02:13:59,850 --> 02:14:07,659
please, please sound the alarm. I just did what I saw. There was an opportunity to maybe get some

533
02:14:07,659 --> 02:14:14,329
more people to help and maybe we need something happened here. I was told to do it. I pulled it

534
02:14:14,329 --> 02:14:19,270
and then I couldn't turn it off. I couldn't get into that side of the apartment building

535
02:14:19,270 --> 02:14:30,979
and then a shotgun was in my face. Does that mean that I get to have a shotgun at some point?

536
02:14:30,979 --> 02:14:46,859
I mean, it has to imply that I can use a shotgun at some point. This game is crazy. This is fun.

537
02:14:46,859 --> 02:14:56,569
I like this. I'm just choked. You sabotage the alarm. Yeah. Well, I just, I don't know,

538
02:14:56,569 --> 02:15:17,739
there's a lot of loud sounds. Okay. Oh, here we go. Let's get this started. This is the real

539
02:15:17,899 --> 02:15:28,789
one now. No one messing around. This is the real deal. We already know the story here.

540
02:15:28,789 --> 02:15:39,989
We can just skip this, right? Okay. Here we go. 6 PM, Monday, January 2nd, Carpenter Street.

541
02:15:40,710 --> 02:15:55,050
How you doing? What's your name? I'm Joanne Callahan. What's it to you? Have a good day.

542
02:15:58,789 --> 02:16:10,340
Whatever. What's the world coming to? Everybody really wants to be around this fire.

543
02:16:11,060 --> 02:16:29,479
Wait, there's a lot of people here. Okay. Is the fight breaking out? Somebody said I had enough.

544
02:16:30,199 --> 02:16:45,719
Hey you, this street is a toll. Pay up. Get lost. You'll regret this decision. What is going?

545
02:16:46,360 --> 02:16:50,739
This person, this person has a knife. This person has a knife. This person has a knife.

546
02:16:51,700 --> 02:17:08,709
Help. This person has a knife. Get, am I being attacked by all of you now? This person has a

547
02:17:08,709 --> 02:17:27,100
knife. Get out of the way. Are you serious? I have to run. I have to run. Somebody help me.

548
02:17:27,100 --> 02:17:33,850
Somebody help. I'm being chased. I'm being chased. I'm being chased. I'm being chased.

549
02:17:36,600 --> 02:17:56,889
I don't know what I'm supposed to do, but please help. Get away from me. Dude, how do I call the

550
02:17:56,889 --> 02:18:02,629
police? How do I? Murder. There's been a murder. There's been a murder. It's probably one of you.

551
02:18:03,590 --> 02:18:23,030
A new murder case. 1102. What was it? Bryant Terrace. Where am I? You are the police.

552
02:18:24,620 --> 02:18:40,790
That was so fucked up. Why? 1102. Now I have to go to the hospital again. I don't even have any

553
02:18:40,790 --> 02:18:51,930
money. I got jumped. I didn't even identify any of those people either. I was just so fucked up.

554
02:18:57,379 --> 02:19:15,379
Help. Help. Help. Help. Wait. Was this the person that had the knife? Come here. Get over here.

555
02:19:15,379 --> 02:19:32,540
Get over here. It was... Give me a second. Okay. I'm going to give you a second. I'm going to give

556
02:19:32,540 --> 02:19:54,700
you the count of three before I drop you. Why am I the bad guy here? This doesn't make any sense.

557
02:19:54,700 --> 02:20:26,819
I don't want to get... Who is this? Are these... Oh, thanks for showing up. Thanks for helping.

558
02:20:26,819 --> 02:20:34,469
They went over here. They went this way. They're right here. It was... No, wait. Where are they?

559
02:20:34,469 --> 02:20:51,049
What is happening? I don't know. I think they're after... I don't know who they're after. Wait. Oh.

560
02:20:51,049 --> 02:21:17,000
I'm just going to die. I need to restart again. I got stabbed 10 times. No reason. Where are we?

561
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:23,239
What are we doing? Somebody's in the building. There's a murderer in the building. Are they still

562
02:21:23,239 --> 02:21:42,819
here? Someone... Okay. There's something going on. How many... Why did you... I should have just taken

563
02:21:42,819 --> 02:22:16,379
the elevator. What am I doing? What floor am I on? How do I get in here? How do I get in there?

564
02:22:16,379 --> 02:22:51,860
All right. Let's do an investigation here. Can I come in and help? Is that the right house?

565
02:22:51,860 --> 02:23:06,889
1102. One... Why is this... Why is this... There is a... Is there a... There is a body on the ground.

566
02:23:06,889 --> 02:23:16,260
Oh my god. Somebody's in the... Don't... No. Wait, wait, wait. I... What are you doing? Stop.

567
02:23:19,530 --> 02:23:28,739
Oh my god, guys. What have I done? I... Your... This shit is backwards. Your door number is

568
02:23:28,739 --> 02:23:39,670
backwards. What? Who has the gun? Get me out. Get me... Be careful. Careful. Careful. Careful.

569
02:23:39,670 --> 02:23:49,930
Careful. Who has a gun? Do you... Let me in. Let me in. I'm out on the fucking deck. Let me in.

570
02:23:52,469 --> 02:24:00,409
I'm out on the fucking ledge. Can I... Somebody let me in? They locked me out. They locked me out on

571
02:24:00,409 --> 02:24:24,420
the ledge. Oh no. Shit. How do I get back in? What the fuck? I have to... I... There's nowhere

572
02:24:24,420 --> 02:24:30,520
to go. I have to restart the whole fucking thing. Oh my god. I... There's nowhere to go. I was stuck.

573
02:24:30,520 --> 02:25:15,000
Damn it. That was so ridiculous. The window opened. You can't... WM1A murder investigation.

574
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:20,409
Yeah, but... Well, hold on though. Let's calm down and think about this for a second.

575
02:25:20,790 --> 02:25:28,899
The last couple... I've tried to generate new seeds. The first seed. I just get attacked. I just get

576
02:25:28,899 --> 02:25:34,739
stabbed and chased and four people are attacking me, killing me. No, that's not even the first one.

577
02:25:34,739 --> 02:25:41,940
A shotgun pointed in my face. Shot. Boom. I get surrounded and attacked. I go up with the police

578
02:25:41,940 --> 02:25:46,260
to help investigate and all of a sudden they start shooting. There's like... People... That was the

579
02:25:46,260 --> 02:25:49,540
killer in there apparently because they went... They had like... They were firing at each other.

580
02:25:49,540 --> 02:25:56,459
I get pushed out to the balcony. I'm just standing out there. I don't even know what

581
02:25:56,459 --> 02:26:09,260
happened. You're a private detective? You can't be at the crime scene. You're not part of the police.

582
02:26:16,440 --> 02:26:25,559
This game is wonderful. This is really fun. It's just... Things can just happen. Everybody is just

583
02:26:25,559 --> 02:26:43,500
doing something. This is great. Okay. I'm getting some advice in the chat. I'm going to listen to

584
02:26:43,500 --> 02:26:53,850
it. I'm going to save immediately after loading up the game. Looks good. Okay. No more insanity. No

585
02:26:53,850 --> 02:27:02,459
more craziness. No more wild behavior from my end. I'm good. I am going to just simply walk down the

586
02:27:02,459 --> 02:27:20,139
street like a normal citizen. I'm just hanging out. How are you? It's good to see you. It's okay.

587
02:27:20,780 --> 02:27:40,700
People like it. I guess. Ain't no pleasing you is there. Both coughed. What's your name?

588
02:27:40,700 --> 02:28:29,059
Keep your nose out of my business. Okay. Nobody saw shit? All right. Just running around with a

589
02:28:29,059 --> 02:28:48,739
hammer. What was that? That was weird. I'm just waiting for a murder. This is weird. This game's

590
02:28:48,739 --> 02:29:14,250
kind of... I'm on edge right now. What's your name? Seen anything unusual? No. When people sprint

591
02:29:14,250 --> 02:29:37,059
around, it makes me nervous. He just has a knife. I think I'm going to just follow this person.

592
02:30:02,520 --> 02:30:21,260
You strolled down the wrong street, pal. Give me your crows. Can I have that broom? I need a phone.

593
02:30:21,260 --> 02:30:26,020
I need a phone. I need a phone. I need a phone. I need a telephone right now. Is there a working

594
02:30:26,020 --> 02:30:41,940
telephone in here? You have a working telephone? You have a working telephone in here? I need to

595
02:30:41,940 --> 02:30:55,340
get a look at you. I need to like inspect. Shit. I got to find a brick or something and throw it.

596
02:30:55,340 --> 02:31:23,719
Give me a brick. Come on. Give me a... Oh my god. Am I in trouble? Am I in trouble? Did I kill this

597
02:31:23,719 --> 02:31:38,760
person? Okay. Well, y'all, you're in trouble. There's no active case. Would you like to create

598
02:31:38,760 --> 02:32:03,190
one? Yes. You attacked me with a knife. Okay. We got it. We have an ID. Potential. Fine. What?

599
02:32:03,190 --> 02:33:00,889
I just took somebody's key. Wait. A knife. No. Pick up the whole toaster. How has that not been

600
02:33:00,889 --> 02:33:09,180
a murder? Oh shit. I did steal this. I did walk out with the toaster. I did not mean to steal it.

601
02:33:09,180 --> 02:33:24,629
Why am I freezing right now? Why am I so cold? Can I not put the toaster in my inventory? I'll bring

602
02:33:24,629 --> 02:33:57,350
it back. Here. I accidentally took this. Take it back. I didn't mean to take that. I can't

603
02:33:57,350 --> 02:34:36,469
go into the registers for investigative purposes. Why am I so cold? There's been no murder. I'm gonna

604
02:34:36,469 --> 02:34:50,520
buy a hot dog or something. What do you got here? Can I buy anything? How do I buy food? Do you know

605
02:34:50,520 --> 02:35:06,149
this person? Okay. Whatever. We'll eat some raw meat. I think I need... I only have 100 bucks,

606
02:35:06,149 --> 02:35:28,379
I guess. What do I need? A bandage? Oh, a heat pack. Here we go. And then... Did that not work?

607
02:35:35,639 --> 02:35:48,340
Oh, this is nice. Did I get some food too? All right. I'm gonna have something to eat.

608
02:35:48,979 --> 02:36:13,530
How about a coffee and a donut? Oh, a cheeseburger sounds pretty good. Okay.

609
02:36:14,709 --> 02:36:31,579
Uh, close the case. Case closed. Okay, I did it. What's your name? I'm Sawyer Barnett. Why?

610
02:36:31,579 --> 02:37:08,659
Anything unusual? No? Can I have some money? Thank you. Somebody just called and said I was broke.

611
02:37:08,659 --> 02:37:16,899
Well, I had 2,200 bucks. Not anymore. I solved the first case and then I had to change seeds.

612
02:37:23,430 --> 02:37:27,110
Work available for a discrete individual. Business related concerns require investigation.

613
02:37:27,110 --> 02:37:32,729
Significant fee available for the right person. Financial compensation. A rare sink disc.

614
02:37:32,729 --> 02:37:51,670
Ooh. 1,400 bucks. I'll take it. 8835611. Okay. What was it? I already forgot. I already forgot.

615
02:37:52,309 --> 02:38:11,399
Okay, let's do it. Oh, it's in... Hear about the job. Meet me at Isaiah's Cafe. I'll be sitting

616
02:38:11,399 --> 02:38:19,559
with a coffee. Ask about Thompson. Make it sharp. Won't he be here for much longer?

617
02:38:20,360 --> 02:38:42,520
Then don't fucking talk my ear off. This is you? Wait, are we already here? Okay. What's it called?

618
02:38:43,000 --> 02:39:30,870
Thompson? No. What was it called? Oh, yeah. Run? That's so good. Doing good. Thanks for asking.

619
02:39:31,510 --> 02:39:39,959
Is this you? Wait, you said you're gonna have a coffee. Who? Who is it? We all have coffees.

620
02:39:56,540 --> 02:40:08,309
That has to be you. Okay. Is this Thompson? Good, you made it. I need you to steal an important

621
02:40:08,309 --> 02:40:16,409
document. It'll be in a sealed red and brown envelope. The leads for the target are in this

622
02:40:16,409 --> 02:40:31,219
briefcase. Take it. It's taking so much to not throw the briefcase right back at this person's

623
02:40:31,219 --> 02:41:13,979
face. Okay. How do I... How do I take this shit out of here? It's already... Oh, okay. Save now,

624
02:41:13,979 --> 02:41:53,059
please. Save now. I got it. He looks so unwell. Pick it up. Locate and steal the item from the

625
02:41:53,059 --> 02:42:16,819
mark. A secret envelope. Do we know anything about this person? Apparently they're here somewhere.

626
02:42:16,819 --> 02:42:23,639
Read their profile. There's nothing here. Short black hair. Large build.

627
02:42:28,579 --> 02:43:44,870
10th floor. All right. 10th floor. I'm biting my lip. Okay. Let's go. Stop. Stop biting your lip.

628
02:43:44,870 --> 02:44:21,819
Stop it. Stop. Okay. I'm done. All right. So let's get it... Let's do this correctly here.

629
02:44:21,819 --> 02:44:37,180
Large. Short black hair. Size 12. He's on the 10th floor. Short black hair. Large. What do we got?

630
02:44:37,180 --> 02:45:26,459
This person is naked. Okay. I don't think that was the right person, first of all. Are we good?

631
02:45:26,459 --> 02:46:45,379
I don't think anybody's... I don't know which one is correct. Ow! I just went... Okay. Camera right

632
02:46:45,379 --> 02:46:55,000
here. I have to get... Turn this camera off. There we go. Am I gonna get in trouble for doing this?

633
02:46:55,000 --> 02:47:16,219
Turn this shit off. God damn it. Get those back on. All right. We're good. I didn't mean to do that,

634
02:47:16,219 --> 02:47:39,690
but okay. Somebody's phone is ringing in here. I don't even know if this is the right house.

635
02:47:39,690 --> 02:48:23,750
This is the right house. God damn it. That's so stupid. Okay. I don't have the... I don't think

636
02:48:23,750 --> 02:48:36,420
I have this correct. I need more info. I'm just gonna go... I'm going back outside. This is... I'm

637
02:48:36,420 --> 02:49:02,360
not... This is bad. What time is it? Can I just sit on the ground for the first guy again? The naked

638
02:49:02,360 --> 02:49:34,489
guy? Close on this time. How are you? What's your name? Anything unusual? No. Do you know... I don't

639
02:49:34,489 --> 02:50:15,530
care. Never mind. Fuck off. Somebody opened the door. I heard a door open. Short black hair.

640
02:50:15,530 --> 02:50:22,819
Large build. I don't know. Sorry. Wait. Can I... Can I come in? What's your name? What's it gonna do

641
02:50:22,819 --> 02:50:47,379
with you? Do you mind if I come in and take a look around? Jesus. Okay. I don't... I don't think it's

642
02:50:47,379 --> 02:51:09,270
you. It's not you. So I've narrowed it down to two doors. The cameras are back on. Oh shit. They are.

643
02:51:09,270 --> 02:51:58,340
Okay. Murder! That's literally right here. That's right here. It's in the same building. Go, go,

644
02:51:58,340 --> 02:52:40,219
go, go, go. I got it right now. Before I do this, is this possible? All right. You're under arrest.

645
02:52:40,219 --> 02:52:49,530
You're under arrest. You're under... You are under arrest. You're under arrest. You are. You... You're

646
02:52:49,610 --> 02:53:09,879
under arrest right now. You're under arrest. I think. Um, this is a cop? What? That's a cop?

647
02:53:09,879 --> 02:53:37,340
No, it's not. They're not even here yet. That's a cop. Okay. All right. Where's the body? Where's the

648
02:53:37,340 --> 02:54:07,930
body? Files. Here we are. Luke Woters. Get that gone. Get that gone. You gotta find the body.

649
02:54:07,930 --> 02:54:25,829
This is the wrong place. Is it? Are you sure? Why was the cop in here then? That wasn't a cop.

650
02:54:25,829 --> 02:55:16,729
Am I even in... What is the 901? How do I get this guy to get out of here? What's your name?

651
02:55:16,729 --> 02:55:26,569
Hello. I'm... Oh, of course. Okay. Luke Woters. Anything unusual? Nothing. There's an investigation.

652
02:55:26,569 --> 02:55:44,420
Can I get your fingerprints? Thank you very much. Appreciate it. We do have fingerprints.

653
02:55:44,979 --> 02:56:02,950
Type B. Just in case. I don't need this right now. Let's go. So, I need you to go away. Because I

654
02:56:02,950 --> 02:56:17,399
need to get in here. Is there a camera? There is. I need you to go away. Really appreciate it. No,

655
02:56:17,399 --> 02:56:23,620
you're still here. This is your house, right? That's your house. Look. There's a... There was a noise

656
02:56:23,620 --> 02:56:31,399
in there. Didn't you hear that? Did you hear the noise in your apartment? This is... I heard it.

657
02:56:31,399 --> 02:56:36,940
Something's fucked up in there, I think. You better go and check it out. You don't hear that?

658
02:56:37,500 --> 02:56:58,100
How do I... Will he even see this? All right. Save it just in case he sees. Does he see it?

659
02:56:58,100 --> 02:57:27,239
I have no lockpicks. Will you look somewhere else? You're just staring at me. You know what?

660
02:57:27,239 --> 02:58:02,040
Oh my god. He didn't even go in. Dispatch, do you copy? I didn't know you had to click again.

661
02:58:02,040 --> 02:58:10,969
Oh my god. Okay, for those of you that are watching at home, if you click drink on anything,

662
02:58:10,969 --> 02:58:17,959
it's not just drink until you let go of click. You have to click again to stop drinking. Okay.

663
02:58:26,420 --> 02:58:38,579
This is awful. My controls are backwards. I just gotta wait till everybody leaves and then I can

664
02:58:38,579 --> 02:58:53,139
go in there and... Oh my god. Your drunk movement speed and control penalty. This'll disappear on

665
02:58:53,139 --> 02:59:02,739
its own. Coming. What? Can I even look in here? I'm not allowed in here. You gotta be shitting me.

666
02:59:02,739 --> 02:59:07,540
I'm just drinking. I'm just drinking and walking around. There's nothing weird. See? I'm just

667
02:59:07,540 --> 02:59:21,829
drinking. That's it. I'm allowed to drink in my own property. No, dude. I can't walk forward.

668
02:59:23,979 --> 02:59:33,399
I can't walk forward. Orsis, open up. Where have they gone? Wait, why are you opening up this door?

669
02:59:33,399 --> 03:00:25,399
I was just gonna sit in the corner. I just shattered my ankle. Okay. Have you completed

670
03:00:25,399 --> 03:00:56,440
your investigation? Can I go in there now? Or no? Can I not go in here? Hey! I'm just...

671
03:01:11,670 --> 03:01:23,020
Damn it. Get up. Get up. When I press W, it moves backwards, by the way.

672
03:01:27,940 --> 03:01:33,850
Although I'm not in any shape to do an investigation right now. Where's the body?

673
03:01:37,799 --> 03:01:45,159
Oh, wait. What's this? Oh, okay. Might as well. Hey, hair of the dog, don't they say?

674
03:01:53,639 --> 03:02:03,420
Was that... Where's that body? I'm gonna find out where it is. What does it say?

675
03:02:03,420 --> 03:02:12,299
Who cares about this bullshit? Release cigarettes. Good. Yeah, I guess I'll take that.

676
03:02:14,659 --> 03:02:34,420
Oh my god. Where is the body, though? I have to stop. What does it say? The bandit? What does it

677
03:02:34,420 --> 03:02:44,899
say? It says something... Bandit? The bandit? The pin... The pinini? What is it? I don't know

678
03:02:44,899 --> 03:03:00,500
what that says. Go to sleep in their bed. All right. I gotta... I gotta... Dude. I have to... Okay.

679
03:03:01,379 --> 03:03:12,950
I'm crawling right now. Oh, this sucks. This hurts. How do I stop? You need to puke. How?

680
03:03:17,899 --> 03:03:28,790
What? Can I... Will this help? Oh no, that made it worse.

681
03:03:35,340 --> 03:03:59,959
God damn it. I don't even know where this person's bed is. Just sit down. Sit down. This is hard to

682
03:03:59,959 --> 03:04:19,290
even look at. This sucks to even look at. Go to the toilet? Just... Can I sleep here? How do I

683
03:04:19,290 --> 03:04:36,809
pull the watch up and sleep? There it is. Watch. Okay. How do I sleep? You can't sleep while

684
03:04:36,809 --> 03:04:48,540
trespassing. Oh, here it is. No. Wait. No, no, no. I don't want anyone to see what I'm doing.

685
03:04:48,540 --> 03:04:57,299
Here's the bathroom. All right. Puke. Am I imagining that or is that real?

686
03:05:03,899 --> 03:05:13,020
Is that me thinking that? I gotta take a shower. Can I take a shower? How long am I going to be

687
03:05:13,020 --> 03:05:33,780
drunk for? I can't turn it on. Just throw some water in my face. Oh my god. What if I... I'm just

688
03:05:33,780 --> 03:05:36,969
going to turn the lights off so we don't have to suffer looking at this. I'm just going to look

689
03:05:36,969 --> 03:06:09,219
at the ground. Uh oh. Use the toilet. I can't. Can I sit on the toilet? I can't sit on the toilet.

690
03:06:09,780 --> 03:06:21,430
There's no body even in here, by the way. And if it's not, I can't. Press G. I can puke with G.

691
03:06:21,430 --> 03:06:33,260
No, I can't. That's a lie. I am actually... Okay, I need to reload the save. Find a trash can.

692
03:06:36,340 --> 03:06:55,030
Find a trash can? That's the solution? Right here. I can't puke in it. I can't puke in it.

693
03:07:01,940 --> 03:07:14,440
I can't puke in any receptacle. Sit on the couch. All right, this actually is starting... This is

694
03:07:14,440 --> 03:07:30,090
going to hurt everyone's brain. Go drink water. Press G on the toilet. Jump off the landing.

695
03:07:30,090 --> 03:08:08,180
Just jump out and reload. Oh, it's getting better. Do a flip? Press G, dude. G doesn't do anything.

696
03:08:08,180 --> 03:08:29,379
Use your watch to wait. I don't think I can do anything. Sit and use the watch. I'm just

697
03:08:29,379 --> 03:08:37,909
trying to get out of here. Jump. I'm giving this 30 more seconds than I'm reloading. I actually

698
03:08:38,229 --> 03:08:46,969
didn't even do that. I didn't do that. I actually just walked off there accidentally.

699
03:08:46,969 --> 03:08:57,110
I didn't do that. When I press W, he picks a random direction and walks. I have a bad egg.

700
03:08:57,110 --> 03:09:18,729
I've been arrested. Three stooges aren't in Fortnite yet. Yeah, it's fucked up. I've been

701
03:09:18,729 --> 03:09:26,100
pissed off about it for at least a few years. Oh, I feel so great now. I can actually see what's

702
03:09:26,100 --> 03:10:00,760
happening. Okay, let's get back into that apartment. I am fresh, although I should collect the thing

703
03:10:00,760 --> 03:10:15,989
from City Hall, right? To be on the case. Oh, this is City Hall. Case of the Corpo Assassin.

704
03:10:15,989 --> 03:10:33,420
You got it. Back to it. I got a rash when I opened my Grotto Beast pack. I don't think we had

705
03:10:33,420 --> 03:10:47,100
anything to do with that. Where does the killer live? What weapon? Do you have evidence that...

706
03:10:47,100 --> 03:11:08,469
Okay. Let's see if I can get in there now. Ninth floor. I know. I just want to... I have to

707
03:11:08,469 --> 03:11:17,159
apologize to everybody here. Yes. I am the guy last night that was drunk and walked off the banister.

708
03:11:17,159 --> 03:11:25,420
I just want to say sorry. I caused a little bit of a problem for everybody. I may have walked around

709
03:11:25,420 --> 03:11:32,420
and I think I knocked on a bunch of people's doors. I was trying to find the killer, I think,

710
03:11:33,139 --> 03:11:49,780
was what that was, I believe. Oh, this is my friend. What's going on? Luke? Luke is shitfaced.

711
03:11:49,780 --> 03:12:29,700
Remember when I had the katana? Remember that? That was kind of cool. I know. Just take the elevator.

712
03:12:29,700 --> 03:12:53,209
Okay. Just take that. Oh my goodness. Thing. I look... There's one... There's two floors up.

713
03:12:53,209 --> 03:13:22,149
Why did I even get in here? Okay. It's time to start my investigation. Save it here. Okay.

714
03:13:22,149 --> 03:13:49,690
Where's the body? I thought that was a knife. Oh, this is not the right place. This is wrong.

715
03:13:49,690 --> 03:14:01,479
I just took his glasses. Come on. What are you doing? What are you thinking? How do I put... I

716
03:14:01,479 --> 03:14:18,489
want to take... I want to put those down. Am I wearing them? Okay. That was wrong. It's this one

717
03:14:18,489 --> 03:14:49,770
here. Go. All right. What do we got? Fingerprints. Let's look. There's no body though. Weirdly enough.

718
03:14:49,770 --> 03:15:30,299
Where's the body? Type C. Type C? Where's the pin to pin in it? To pin in it. What does this

719
03:15:30,299 --> 03:15:47,670
say? Put a pin in it? All right. I need to find the key... The keypad. All right. You got something

720
03:15:47,670 --> 03:16:04,540
here. Type C. Money. All right. What is this? Probably a mine. Lots of fingerprints. Anybody

721
03:16:04,540 --> 03:16:42,760
else in here? Just C for now. Cigarette. No. C. C. Where's the body? Oh, food. This is a mess. I

722
03:16:42,760 --> 03:16:53,000
have to get rid of all this stuff. Why is this even pinned? This shouldn't be pinned either. This

723
03:16:53,000 --> 03:17:11,700
guy has nothing to do with any of this. It's a newspaper. Why am I even... Okay. Cool. Dirty

724
03:17:11,700 --> 03:17:58,340
plate. Type C. Can I smoke this? Oh, okay. Is this who lived here? Candy. Matchbox. Is that a knife?

725
03:17:58,340 --> 03:18:22,620
Utility knife? Read the newspaper again. Oh, I have a knife now. Did I stab myself? No. Okay,

726
03:18:22,620 --> 03:18:54,700
good. What's that? Matchbook. Soap. Find the body, please. Where is it? There's no other rooms.

727
03:18:56,739 --> 03:19:28,979
Is this a clue? Put a pin in it. Hold on. Birth control pills? Okay. Birth control pills. What's

728
03:19:28,979 --> 03:19:52,139
this? Oh. Didn't have what it takes. Kill to get ahead. They must earn my respect. Fingerprints

729
03:19:52,139 --> 03:19:58,979
probably match, right? The wound caused by a sharp object or blade. Where was anybody? It was appears

730
03:19:58,979 --> 03:20:02,500
the victim has been slashed to death by a bladed weapon. I can determine the time of death is

731
03:20:02,500 --> 03:20:14,229
between 1745 and 1900. Monday, January 2nd, 1979. And that... All right. So what do we got?

732
03:20:17,020 --> 03:20:24,360
Yin is the one line on the ground here. Fingerprints. Those are fingerprints. We've

733
03:20:24,360 --> 03:20:37,659
got them. Type C. All right. So we know that you worked here at Revenue Tree Networks.

734
03:20:37,659 --> 03:20:45,500
I'm not done investigating yet, but I know what I'm looking for. Is that it?

735
03:20:46,629 --> 03:21:09,959
That's it. That's also it. Okay. So now, now what? Any prints here? Maybe this prints. Type D. Relax.

736
03:21:09,959 --> 03:21:16,659
We got Type D fingerprints. And that's on the business card that says, didn't have what it

737
03:21:16,659 --> 03:21:23,620
takes to... Like I'm going to kill you or whatever. Okay. We're looking for this person, Type D.

738
03:21:23,620 --> 03:21:40,489
They had a business card. All right. Now what is that? Revenue Tree Networks. Yeah. Head of HR.

739
03:21:40,489 --> 03:21:46,489
901 Robert Heights. Yep. That's where we are now. I'm just going to hold onto it.

740
03:21:46,489 --> 03:21:52,819
And then there's a note. Yin, remember your passcode this time. Count backwards from 9.

741
03:21:52,819 --> 03:22:22,409
I got to see what's in there. Take a look. 8 7 6 5. 9 8 7 6. Nothing in here. It must have been

742
03:22:22,409 --> 03:22:38,170
stolen. Actually weird. Why is nothing in there? Fingerprints. Good call. Let's try it. Okay.

743
03:22:38,250 --> 03:23:01,940
Okay. This is your fingerprints. No one else was in here. No. I don't think any thing... Nothing

744
03:23:01,940 --> 03:23:12,899
out of the ordinary here. Oh, what about the computer? There was another name in the computer,

745
03:23:12,899 --> 03:23:43,850
wasn't there? Check it out. Telephone number. Okay. We've got emails. Request of your help.

746
03:23:44,409 --> 03:23:51,459
Hello dear Yin Zhu. I need your help. I have become stuck overseas after being mugged

747
03:23:51,459 --> 03:23:58,979
dreadfully. I have no papers and I'm greatly nervous. Please send me one fifteen hundred

03:24:04,899 --> 03:24:10,180
world. You must rely the world and I have no other friend in the world. I must rely on you.

755
03:25:06,540 --> 03:25:12,260

03:25:12,260 --> 03:25:15,379
so sorry for letting you down. I hate myself. I'll never do it again. I swear. Please believe me.

757
03:25:17,319 --> 03:25:35,049
Interesting. Who's that? Print that out. Who are you? I wonder if you have type D.

758
03:25:36,649 --> 03:25:53,590
Fingerprints. It's possible that you have type D. It's a spam. I'm sorry it won't happen again.

759
03:25:53,590 --> 03:25:56,870
I swear to tell the truth things have been tough at home and I know it has been affecting my work

760
03:25:56,870 --> 03:26:01,049
but I swear I'll do better from now on. I'll work overtime to catch up. Please give me a few weeks

761
03:26:01,049 --> 03:26:23,510
to prove myself. Oh Detective Bugleberry's on the case. So we have some we have some people here.

762
03:26:29,559 --> 03:26:43,059
Okay so this is all spam. So we need to find these other people. What do you got in here?

763
03:26:43,059 --> 03:27:00,309
Employment contract. Okay let's go to revenue tree networks. All right revenue tree networks. That

764
03:27:00,309 --> 03:27:04,790
is where we are going. We're going to find out who works there. We're going to find out what's going

765
03:27:04,790 --> 03:27:29,030
on here. What about prints on the files? Not a bad idea. It doesn't look like it. She's moving.

766
03:27:29,030 --> 03:27:51,020
You're live? I don't know. Okay let's go. That's weird. Stop biting your lip. You guys need to

767
03:27:51,020 --> 03:28:04,920
tell me to stop when I do that. I'm relying on you. All right that was fairly clean this time.

768
03:28:04,920 --> 03:28:43,930
Let's go to the work. I'll save it when I get up. What should I name my baby? Frank. All right let's

769
03:28:43,930 --> 03:29:05,239
move. I do have a weapon though. I have a knife now. Do you know what I wanted to try? Because

770
03:29:05,239 --> 03:29:14,059
I've never really had it. I think I've only had it maybe once ever. White Castle. Is White Castle

771
03:29:14,059 --> 03:29:21,670
any good? I saw like this this fucking like YouTube video where it showed how they make it.

772
03:29:21,670 --> 03:29:29,989
Did you guys know? Am I completely full of shit here? But they make these little patties. These

773
03:29:29,989 --> 03:29:36,790
little squares. And they put five holes. One two three four five. Almost looks like a dice.

774
03:29:38,180 --> 03:29:44,569
And they put it on a flat top. And they don't flip it. They don't flip the burger. They put

775
03:29:44,569 --> 03:29:52,629
it on the flat top. It's so small. They put it on a bed of onions. It's on a bed of chopped onions.

776
03:29:52,629 --> 03:29:57,030
They put the meat right on top. And then the steam from the water. They put a bun on top.

777
03:29:57,030 --> 03:30:03,500
And it cooks the other side too. And then they pick it up weirdly. I also saw that YouTube short.

778
03:30:03,500 --> 03:30:14,170
Yeah I did too. I just wanted it. It made me want it. Has anybody in this chat eaten White Castle

779
03:30:14,170 --> 03:30:43,909
before? Yes. Yes. Yes. It's very bad. It's repulsive. What? It's good. It's good. It's good.

780
03:30:44,469 --> 03:30:55,079
It's amazing. It's ass. It's average. It's good in a disgusting way. All right. What was I doing

781
03:30:55,079 --> 03:31:09,559
going up? Right? What am I even doing here? Is this the business? Revenue Tree Networks. It is. Is

782
03:31:09,559 --> 03:31:13,239
the business just in somebody's apartment or something? Or is it? No this is an office.

783
03:31:14,200 --> 03:31:45,620
What um where is it? What floor is it on? White Castle fucking sucks dude. I feel like people

784
03:31:45,620 --> 03:31:56,440
are too harsh. I can't imagine driving through the White Castle drive through with holding up

785
03:31:56,440 --> 03:32:02,340
the glasses on the stick. The mustache and like slick back hair and stuff. Just go and eat it.

786
03:32:02,340 --> 03:32:06,629

granny like is when in this room there is a piece of bubble gum and then 500 meters that way in a

869

different building there is a sink that has a pipe underneath the sink that i can put the bubble gum

870
04:04:23,000 --> 04:04:29,959
on and then what that does is that stops up the drain or that that allows the water to fill up

871
04:04:29,959 --> 04:04:35,909
so i can get the stick that comes up then i can come back here wedge the stick into the door by
