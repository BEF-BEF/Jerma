1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:23,500
Hold on, hold on a second. Do you see him sliding? No. He is sliding like no animation on my screen.

2
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,989
Is he dead? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I was gonna like beat him up, but... He's dead.

3
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:36,659
Yo, Jarvan, look at this guy. He's dead. He's bleeding. There's a puddle of... Hold on, what happened?

4
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:44,659
He tripped on this little triangle over here. He ran so fast. He hit this and he died.

5
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:48,659
Look how far... Look at his neck from over here. It kind of looks like it's broken, doesn't it?

6
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:54,659
Dude, he must have smashed his face so hard to instantly die.

7
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:09,219
We're still riding the wheelie. Wow, you can hold this for a long time. Whoa! Oh my god.

8
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:19,879
That was cool. Oh, we just... Oh, fine, I got this. You wanna see my skills? Oh, here's a sick jump.

9
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:44,680
Why is that jump there? That whole chain of events just didn't make any sense.

10
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:54,000
And then I hit my face on a wall. That was awesome. What is this giant boat? Oh, I thought that was a boat.

11
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,500
Here, let me do a wheelie onto this lady. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You gotta...

12
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:19,830
What is happening? How did we get down here? No! You see that. I do. I'm not gonna freak out.

13
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,830
Can you snipe it? Can you snipe the guy out of it? No, I don't know. Don't shoot him. You don't want to risk it?

14
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,830
No, because he'll step on the gas like sometimes they do. What is he doing? He already knows we're after him.

15
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:34,830
He's bullying this guy off the road from... Yeah, if I shoot this guy right now, he's going to step on the gas.

16
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:42,909
Wouldn't you, if you're in this car? Well, shoot him in the head. Go. Nice. I'm driving this.

17
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:57,060
Not nice, because now... Where is he? Did he get you? He got you, Jerma. He was completely stopped.

18
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:15,439
The ghost of the guy in the GT. His otherworldly soul needed revenge on me. I can't believe that happened. Why did that happen?

19
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:23,770
We got out. Is he dead? Yeah, I got him out of the car somehow. I think this car is cursed now, though.

20
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:28,460
No, it's getting away. Get in the car, get in the car, get in the car, get in the car. Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

21
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,460
I'm trying. That lady is like... Oh my god, do you see this lady?

22
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:41,129
Hold on, did I... I got in the car? How did I get in the car?

23
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:46,500
No question. Just go, go, go, go. Keep going straight. Fast, fast.

24
00:03:47,500 --> 00:04:01,719
I don't understand what just happened. Let's see if you can do it. My whole life is riding on this moment.

25
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:08,960
Your entire life is riding on if you can make this GTA jump. I will die if I don't do it.

26
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:19,399
I'm dead. How does that happen?

27
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:27,220
We hit the first step. Hold on, let's think about this in reality right now.

28
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:36,139
That's probably what would happen if you tried to do that in the big... What the hell is going on?

29
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:41,019
I thought you were going to drive right into that guy. Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going.

30
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:44,019
Not going in the tunnel. Go to the left of the tunnel. We're going to turn right again.

31
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:50,850
I don't think that's going to... We're fine, we're fine. We're fine, we're fine.

32
00:04:50,850 --> 00:05:03,290
Go fast, fast. Hit this guy. 10 points. Don't get hit by these cars. Oh my god. You did, didn't you?

33
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:08,910
I hit my face on the lamppost. I've never seen that before.

34
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,910
Okay, get on your bike. Meet me.

35
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,910
Hold on. I'm recovering from this laugh.

36
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:32,920
Sick burnout, bro. Did you see the guy I hit behind you? Oh my god.

37
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:43,000
This is so... I can't... Oh, good thing, good.

38
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We wanted to do as much car damage to this as humanly possible.

39
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,569
Yes, before it blows up. You know what, Jerma? I say we get it to the point where it's going to blow up.

40
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:54,569
It's on fire. Yep. Yep.

41
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:56,569
All right, what do you want to do with it? Just keep driving.

42
00:05:56,569 --> 00:06:02,959
Just pretend like, you know, you want to go to 7-Eleven and get some late night snacks.

43
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,959
Yeah, they have drinks at 7-Eleven, right? Of course they do.

44
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:12,959
Yeah, that's usually all I get at 7-Eleven. I don't know if, like, you want, um, like, Funyuns or something weird.

45
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,959
I was pretty close, but I, like, bumped something.

46
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,959
We're going over the bridge. I'm sick of this place.

47
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:22,959
Oh, no, this tire... This tire's not having it.

48
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:28,660
Yeah, you just ran... I did that. I did that.

49
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,660
Yep. You gonna kill me, Jerma? You gonna keep killing me? Or can we actually, like, have some fun with this?

50
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:38,660
I'm sitting in the front seat. How would I have been able to do that, GTA?

51
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,019
He killed it. He ran himself over. I didn't do anything.
