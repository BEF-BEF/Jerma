1
00:00:05,059 --> 00:00:10,189
How's it going? Well, I should wait a few minutes.

2
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:18,179
Sometimes I forget free rolls exist on Twitch, but I'm here.

3
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:21,660
All right, let's give it a minute. I'll be right back.

4
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:48,369
This community is so funny. I love this place. I'll tell you a couple of reasons why.

5
00:00:48,369 --> 00:01:01,789
First of all, everybody in here is so excited, not for sorcery, not for any announcements.

6
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:07,629
The most exciting thing is me taking a bite out of a BLT.

7
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,879
It's like, this is a huge deal.

8
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,280
Oh, BLT, let's go. No way. Is he going to eat a BLT?

9
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,040
Tons of streamers eat food every day on stream.

10
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:31,140
In fact, there's probably right now, there's probably five to 10,000 different streamers

11
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,620
right now across the whole website eating food right now.

12
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:47,549
I actually haven't had a BLT in a long time, but we're not doing that immediately.

13
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:53,150
I want to wait till a little bit later. We need to wait till most people are here.

14
00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:03,280
Is it a turkey BLT? Nope. It's just bread, a little coating of mayonnaise,

15
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:08,699
lettuce, tomato, bacon, toasted.

16
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,780
Well, let's not get crazy here. Let's not get crazy.

17
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:25,310
What do you mean mayo with question marks? You eat dry ass BLTs? Who does that?

18
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,719
You just put lettuce, tomato, and bacon in between bread?

19
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:39,629
That's dry. But the tomato, yeah, mayo is always on a BLT.

20
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,050
Always. I don't want that dry bread.

21
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:48,060
But yeah, let's go over it. Let's talk about some stuff.

22
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,060
Today is a very eventful day.

23
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:53,419
Not just the fact that we're starting Sorcery Part 4.

24
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,680
So yes, people thought I was a liar. We're doing Sorcery 4 today.

25
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,319
We're going to start it.

26
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:10,419
We're also going to talk about Grotto Beasts and the Grotto Beasts tabletop simulator mod.

27
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:17,539
I have some photos to show you. It's really, really, really nice.

28
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:23,020
Some news about that. Also something else to talk about.

29
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,669
You'll see.

30
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:32,400
And then, of course, the bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayo sandwich.

31
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,960
We know what it is.

32
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,159
I don't think you do.

33
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:43,969
I talked in free stream today.

34
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,389
That is not what this is.

35
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:48,189
This is different.

36
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:50,430
And I think it's going to surprise a lot of people.

37
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,669
I think a lot of you might know what this thing is.

38
00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:56,189
But it's not what we were talking about in free stream.

39
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:57,949
It's something else.

40
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,569
I'm already shocked.

41
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:04,770
How many bites am I going to take?

42
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:07,150
I don't know.

43
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:07,650
A few.

44
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:09,150
I might eat the whole sandwich.

45
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:09,650
I don't know.

46
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:16,899
Eat an egg salad sandwich instead.

47
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:21,069
Stop stalling.

48
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,660
I think we have to stall today.

49
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,379
Because at the Sorcery Council, I need to make sure they're here.

50
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,649
The whole thing.

51
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:34,420
I might eat half and save half for later or something.

52
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,149
You should raid somebody right now.

53
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:40,560
Just start turning my streams on to raid people.

54
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:44,660
Hey, welcome to the stream, everybody.

55
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,339
Big day today.

56
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,100
Okay, who are we raiding?

57
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,949
I actually want to do that at some point.

58
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:56,939
Hey, the shit we were talking about in free stream today.

59
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,540
I'm going to do that.

60
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,899
I'm going to do that shit.

61
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:00,459
It's going to happen.

62
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:01,100
I'm going to do that.

63
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:02,540
I hope you're ready.

64
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,629
Unfortunately, for the Sorcery High Council.

65
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:19,709
But wait, somebody on the Sorcery High Council is at work right now?

66
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:20,930
Uh-oh.

67
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,529
Well, how many people are on this council?

68
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,579
We talk about the Sorcery High Council.

69
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:35,730
I feel like it's like 2,000 people.

70
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:43,569
It's at least a few thousand people.

71
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,639
How are we ever going to get anything done?

72
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,699
If there's like 5,000 of us that need to be present for every single vote

73
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,740
that we do for the Sorcery High Council.

74
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:58,860
How do we do anything?

75
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,819
You have to be like present in the room.

76
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,620
There's like 15.

77
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,339
Imagine if there was like 15,000 senators.

78
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,509
Everybody must be in attendance when we take these votes.

79
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:17,730
This is a stadium full of people all screaming at each other.

80
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:29,009
Oh, they do.

81
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:31,089
No, they do that in Star Wars?

82
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:31,889
Is that? That looks like.

83
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:33,009
Okay, that's Star Wars.

84
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:37,470
Oh, that's right.

85
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,750
I forgot about the Galactic Senate.

86
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,680
It's a Star Wars Senate.

87
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,180
Yeah.

88
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:53,860
So I forget what happens in Star Wars.

89
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,660
How did, um.

90
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,970
I was just called a fucking Senator of Pompadour.

91
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,329
What's his name?

92
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:01,810
Why do I?

93
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,170
It's Palpatine.

94
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,040
I am the Senate.

95
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Did he just get to say and do whatever he wanted?

96
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,519
How did that work?

97
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,160
How did that work?

98
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,959
There were like 20,000 people in that room.

99
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,629
How did he?

100
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,860
What do you mean spoilers?

101
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:26,129
Guys, Star Wars spoilers are.

102
00:07:27,329 --> 00:07:30,529
They're ingrained in human society.

103
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:32,449
Humanity.

104
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:35,250
There are Star Wars.

105
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,480
Original trilogy spoiler is like.

106
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:42,980
That's like saying that Gollum is in Lord of the Rings.

107
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,519
They gave him emergency powers.

108
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,199
Oh, right.

109
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,079
Those are the prequels.

110
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,800
Oh, I never saw those.

111
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,399
I never saw those ones.

112
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:11,310
I just saw like six or seven YouTube shorts of like.

113
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:14,500
I think Empire Strikes Back.

114
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,379
I've never even seen the movies.

115
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:16,500
I have no idea how it even happens.

116
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:23,759
Of course, you watch shorts.

117
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,319
Can I talk about shorts for a second?

118
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,009
When I scroll YouTube shorts.

119
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,450
I do it for a few minutes or even it doesn't matter.

120
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,169
If I do YouTube shorts for a little while, I just kind of sit there and I'm like.

121
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,700
I have to do something else like I have to.

122
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,940
I have to clean my mind like it's just.

123
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,500
It's sometimes it's just chaos over there.

124
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,019
It's just chaos.

125
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,889
If I scroll shorts for like 30, 40 minutes.

126
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:00,019
That's a lot, right?

127
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:03,629
And it's like, holy shit, how long have I been doing this for now?

128
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:05,149
Let me tell you, I've only done this.

129
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,259
Maybe three or four times ever.

130
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:11,580
Maybe four times ever.

131
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,740
Who scrolls for 40?

132
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:16,450
I don't know.

133
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,409
I don't know how it works.

134
00:09:17,409 --> 00:09:17,970
I don't know.

135
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,809
What am I supposed to stop scrolling?

136
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,169
What am I supposed to stop?

137
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,779
Just watch TikTok and said, I don't want.

138
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:28,299
I don't want to watch either one of them.

139
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,389
I mean, some of them are cool.

140
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:35,149
Like, you know, you go through, you're like, whoa, holy shit.

141
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,549
I can't fucking believe that bottle made it all the way down and didn't break.

142
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:41,710
That's fucking unbelievable.

143
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:54,129
He watches the bottle ones.

144
00:09:56,129 --> 00:10:00,269
YouTube shorts are fucking insane.

145
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:02,799
Yeah.

146
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:05,419
Like Subway surfer's sludge.

147
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,419
Dude, I don't know anything about it.

148
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:11,899
All I know is the few times I've done it, I've gone.

149
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,299
All right.

150
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:13,860
That was all right.

151
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,899
I'm, uh, I'm good for a little while.

152
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:18,379
Yeah.

153
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:20,139
I've seen the entire skibbity toilet.

154
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:21,659
I've seen all of them except for the last.

155
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:22,779
Like I got to catch up.

156
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:29,070
Is it bad that I've seen all of skibbity toilet, but I stopped watching Better Call Saul at

157
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:29,629
season two?

158
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,129
I don't know why I do these things.

159
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:33,570
It's just, I don't know.

160
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:35,169
Is this bad?

161
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:36,049
But whatever.

162
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:36,529
It's okay.

163
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:41,970
If the entirety of skibbity toilet is what?

164
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,610
Like third, 20 total minutes, 30 minutes.

165
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,049
What is skibbity toilet?

166
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:47,090
I don't know.

167
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:47,730
I don't know.

168
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,210
I just, I just was on one and it was like, I'm like, okay, just go to the next one.

169
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:52,929
Go, go, go.

170
00:10:52,929 --> 00:10:53,809
40 minutes later.

171
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:54,450
That's what happened.

172
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,490
That's what happened.

173
00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:02,899
I just lost respect for you.

174
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,590
Yeah.

175
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:07,789
I'm dying right now.

176
00:11:07,789 --> 00:11:09,070
You need to grow up.

177
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,470
Oh, grown ass man.

178
00:11:11,549 --> 00:11:13,389
Oh, fucking grown ass, man.

179
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:14,029
I don't even know.

180
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:15,629
I have, maybe I haven't seen it all.

181
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:22,460
It's hard to tell, bro.

182
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,340
You're 40.

183
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,299
I don't know how these, I don't, I'm not like a shorts guy.

184
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:29,340
I don't, I'm look, I'm wanting to maybe get back into YouTube.

185
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:32,220
Talk about that another time, but I don't know.

186
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,460
Maybe, maybe do I, should I make some shorts or something?

187
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,500
Maybe I can make some fun ones.

188
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:35,899
I don't know.

189
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:38,269
Remember you're 40.

190
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:38,909
Not yet.

191
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:39,309
Almost.

192
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,830
That's the last time you saw an entire TV show.

193
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:45,940
All right.

194
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,700
I have to, we have to, I gotta, I know I'm stalling, but mods.

195
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,580
Can we do a poll, please?

196
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,259
And answer this truthfully?

197
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:54,179
Because I know people are going, oh my God, dude.

198
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:55,620
You can't believe you fucking watched that.

199
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,580
How did you, really?

200
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,940
You watched Skimity Toilet?

201
00:11:58,899 --> 00:11:59,779
How many of you have seen it?

202
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,259
How many of you have seen it?

203
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:05,179
Like, I want like a real answer of you.

204
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:06,620
Have you seen at least 10 of them?

205
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,830
Yeah.

206
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,509
And I want it to be answered truthfully.

207
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:22,000
Maybe, okay.

208
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:27,600
I think I watched the whole thing a while ago when there weren't the amount of episodes that exist.

209
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,879
Now it takes like three minutes.

210
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:33,279
Yeah.

211
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:33,519
All right.

212
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,879
Did you?

213
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,480
And I want real answers.

214
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,679
And don't you lie.

215
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:38,879
I know some of you are gonna.

216
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:45,889
All right.

217
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:50,370
We got a 20% yes, which means it's more like 40% yes.

218
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:54,179
The other 20% that are not voting yes.

219
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:56,899
You're in the same room with somebody that's like, oh yeah, Skimity Toilet.

220
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:57,779
Fucking what?

221
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:58,100
Yeah.

222
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:58,820
I'm voting no.

223
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:01,419
And you were like, yeah, me too.

224
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:02,820
Yeah.

225
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,179
It's at least 30% of you.

226
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:08,080
Whatever.

227
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,879
Whatever.

228
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:09,679
I watched it.

229
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:10,399
I watched some of it.

230
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:10,960
Whatever.

231
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,440
Who cares?

232
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,799
We're good.

233
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,860
20% means 20%.

234
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,159
It only means no.

235
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,159
It means like 30%.

236
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,279
Day 44 of asking you for a nun cosplay.

237
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:41,889
I saw a, like a trailer or like an image for like, there's like, there's another,

238
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:43,570
there's another like evil nun movie.

239
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,490
This October.

240
00:13:48,049 --> 00:13:48,610
The Nun.

241
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:51,549
Hey, remember that movie with the nun?

242
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,779
Fucking evil nun.

243
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,289
We're really leaning into the evil nun.

244
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:10,480
The Nun 2.

245
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:17,200
It's a really, it's a really old trope.

246
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,360
Yeah.

247
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,879
Like the evil nun.

248
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:26,820
Watch the new Saw trailer.

249
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,700
No, I don't.

250
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:37,200
Yeah.

251
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,120
I watched Skimity Toilet because I was, I was curious because I heard people talking about it.

252
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:43,500
I was like, what is this?

253
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,340
And then I watched it for a little bit and I stopped.

254
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,379
I was like, okay, well, I'm done.

255
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:53,460
Vinny fought you in Rivals of Aether yesterday.

256
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,340
You won.

257
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:54,740
Thank you.

258
00:14:55,539 --> 00:14:57,659
What's the lore?

259
00:14:57,659 --> 00:14:58,379
I don't know.

260
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:04,000
Stop trying to justify it.

261
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,399
Yeah.

262
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:04,799
You know what?

263
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,549
I don't even, I don't even need to justify it.

264
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:09,950
I did it.

265
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,789
I watched it.

266
00:15:11,789 --> 00:15:13,710
I need to justify the fact that I watched this.

267
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:18,779
Didn't Vinny watch this too?

268
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,820
Wait, Vinny, did Vinny watch this too?

269
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,139
Didn't he?

270
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,899
See, that's where I got the idea.

271
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:27,659
That's where I got the, that's where I got the idea.

272
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,340
That's where I got the idea.

273
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,539
I heard he was doing it and I was like, oh, I guess I'll watch this too.

274
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:43,649
Anyways, he's blaming Vinny.

275
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,240
Don't you blame Vinny.

276
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,580
Ludwig watched it.

277
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,700
Ludwig watched it too.

278
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:56,659
Hey, I'm going to blame other streamers for this.

279
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:57,940
It's, I didn't, it's not me.

280
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,740
I watched other streamers do it and I thought I was going to do it too.

281
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,460
It's not my fault.

282
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:05,200
But he said, fuck this guy.

283
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,139
All right.

284
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:09,899
I don't, I don't know the lore.

285
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:10,700
I don't care.

286
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:15,250
I don't need to, we're just going to move on because that's what we're doing.

287
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,049
Playing Sorcery.

288
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:25,809
There's lore.

289
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:26,769
I, yeah, I think so.

290
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:27,250
I don't know.

291
00:16:29,539 --> 00:16:30,500
Do the voice.

292
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,379
Which, what voice?

293
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:40,830
What are you talking about?

294
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,590
The high council has voted for you to move on.

295
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:52,539
Uh, well as, uh, as the Senator, King Senator.

296
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,240
I wanted to talk for a few minutes before we went.

297
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,759
So, all right, let's go.

298
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,440
Sorcery part four.

299
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,799
We have a lot of stuff to talk about later.

300
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:02,720
I, I'm going to wait until a little bit later though.

301
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:08,660
Sorcery enjoyers.

302
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:10,289
Let's go.

303
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,839
Okay.

304
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,759
So this is going to get, this is going to catch us up a little bit.

305
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:24,000
Long ago, or so they say, the ancient world was prosperous and free.

306
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:27,809
From the Kakabad Sea, to the lake, to Lake Lumle.

307
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:29,650
Harvests were plentiful.

308
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,960
People were happy.

309
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,839
All was at peace.

310
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:41,230
I may have been sitting at this screen for too long for the music to have played a few

311
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,750
times and no longer is playing.

312
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:50,319
All was at peace, even the thundering skies were calm, tamed by the arts of the sorcerers

313
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,119
of Mampang.

314
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,470
Then everything changed.

315
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:59,740
A fearsome sorcerer leveled the cities and turned the fields to dust with towers of devastating

316
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,930
light.

317
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,289
He heard no plea.

318
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:10,819
Cutting down village after village, the mages scrabbled to defend the ancient world, but

319
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:12,019
they were weak.

320
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:17,700
Finally, the last archmage sealed the walls of Mampang and sent out seven deadly serpents

321
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,700
to keep the dark sorcerer away.

322
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:27,150
All seven died.

323
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:31,470
And now here you are, climbing the narrow pass into the mountains of high Xamon.

324
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,490
The price of your journey across the backlands has already been paid.

325
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:41,789
Now, the Anoland is coming to Mampang and nothing will be allowed to stand in his path.

326
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:48,059
The crown will be yours.

327
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:52,480
Ladies and gentlemen, Inkle and...

328
00:18:52,480 --> 00:19:13,150
...Steve Jackson's Sorcery, part four, Crown of Kings.

329
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:19,039
Hey, there's the audio.

330
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,819
Okay, so here we...

331
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:24,369
To give you a recap, we beat the seven serpents.

332
00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:27,329
We now are going for the archmage.

333
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:32,420
The archmage is the evil, evil archmage.

334
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,299
Where's the music?

335
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:34,500
It'll come up.

336
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,809
There's no sound.

337
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:38,769
Yeah, there is.

338
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:40,369
All right, here we are.

339
00:19:40,369 --> 00:19:41,539
The sun begins to dip.

340
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:46,019
Heading towards the horizon, you climb an ancient staircase worn to almost nothing by

341
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:46,740
the years.

342
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,799
Look at the steps.

343
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:55,059
Long ago, these steps were etched with messages, warnings, and words of advice and succor to

344
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:57,700
the acolytes making the pilgrimage to the fortress.

345
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,450
But they have long since been scrubbed away by dust, and the remaining marks tell you

346
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:06,099
nothing.

347
00:20:06,099 --> 00:20:07,299
Check my provisions.

348
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:11,019
You open your pack to check your provisions and nod with satisfaction.

349
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:14,930
You have enough for four meals, but that should be enough.

350
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:20,849
If you have not found the crown within four days, most likely it will be because you are

351
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:21,410
dead.

352
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:25,789
Okay, in the distance, black smoke curls upwards.

353
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:28,269
You have four BLTs.

354
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:34,259
Check the sword.

355
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:35,789
At least you have your blade.

356
00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:40,109
You draw your assassin's sword an inch from its scabbard, its edge flashing in the dying

357
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:40,829
sunlight.

358
00:20:40,829 --> 00:20:42,589
It is a fine, strong weapon.

359
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,380
You're well-armed for whatever terrors lie ahead.

360
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:51,359
Pulling up your hood against the chill air, you stride onwards through the meager mountain

361
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:52,460
sunlight.

362
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,980
You must not linger out here.

363
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,539
I don't want to do any spoilers.

364
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:00,289
He waited for the plus twos to come in.

365
00:21:00,289 --> 00:21:07,890
Well, I read it in chat, so there already was a chat plus two, so I'm just talking about

366
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,299
it.

367
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:12,910
You reflect on your progress with a heavy heart as you climb.

368
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,089
The backlands were a cursed place, and your journey across them was slow.

369
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:18,380
Was it?

370
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,859
Even with the serpents defeated, caution would be wise.

371
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:25,099
It is possible that other messengers will have brought news of your presence to the

372
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:26,960
archmage's ears.

373
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,599
Walk on.

374
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:32,740
You walk on, head held high, up the steps.

375
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,759
The wind picks up as the evening draws on.

376
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:39,259
It will be night soon.

377
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:42,619
The Zanzunu peaks rise on either side like jagged teeth.

378
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:48,460
The path winds back and forth as it climbs, and glimpses of the brooding horror of Mampang

379
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,029
come and go.

380
00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:54,319
You should make progress while there is still plenty of light.

381
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:56,019
Sing as I climb.

382
00:21:56,019 --> 00:21:59,390
You try to sing as you climb.

383
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:04,509
An old Anolan song that tells of a wandering wizard and his three small children.

384
00:22:04,509 --> 00:22:07,250
But even you cannot be jolly in this dread place.

385
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,599
The song dies in your throat.

386
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:14,140
Okay.

387
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,099
Rough undergrowth.

388
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,140
Rough undergrowth springs up, lining the path on either side.

389
00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:25,069
Should we just look in it?

390
00:22:25,069 --> 00:22:30,160
Perhaps one of the acolytes who climbed this way years ago dropped something of use.

391
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,960
You pause and push back the undergrowth with the blade of your sword, and then jump as

392
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,519
you disturb a nesting spike hawk.

393
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:40,269
The creature flaps in alarm.

394
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:44,910
Kill it, stay back, or walk away.

395
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:45,869
My acolytes!

396
00:22:45,869 --> 00:22:50,000
My acolytes!

397
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,390
Stay back?

398
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,309
All right, I'm going to stay back.

399
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:57,789
You stay well clear, and the hawk screams and flaps its wide wings, but does not chase

400
00:22:57,789 --> 00:22:58,190
you.

401
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,440
It sounds something like this.

402
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,319
I can't do that voice anymore.

403
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:07,039
I'm fucking 40.

404
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:07,519
Never mind.

405
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,420
Uh, should I talk?

406
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:20,509
Maybe I can talk to him.

407
00:23:20,509 --> 00:23:21,470
Talk with animals?

408
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,269
Let's just, why not?

409
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,809
Grabbing the wig from your pack, you pull it onto your head and weave your spell.

410
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:34,769
Faint chitterings from the bush resolve into words.

411
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:36,299
Worms!

412
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,059
Worms!

413
00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:39,180
Dark!

414
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,140
Dark!

415
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:47,039
Uh, speak a greeting?

416
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,500
Greetings!

417
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,430
I am a traveler.

418
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:54,589
A moment later the bushes part, and a mother spike hawk rises from the undergrowth.

419
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,349
Intruder!

420
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:57,549
Attack!

421
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:58,589
Beast!

422
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:00,670
Eyes!

423
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:01,390
Get the eyes!

424
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,940
I mean you no harm.

425
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,740
I mean you no harm, you reply quickly.

426
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:15,460
The wig translating your intention into clicks of your tongue and curious squawks.

427
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,339
Harm?

428
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:17,140
Harm!

429
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,299
The bird screeches back, rising higher.

430
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:22,029
Oh shit.

431
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:22,589
Back off.

432
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:25,039
I come in peace.

433
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,640
What am I, a fucking alien?

434
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,190
Did I just, did I just get out of a spaceship?

435
00:24:32,849 --> 00:24:33,970
I come in peace.

436
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:37,420
Peace!

437
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:42,339
Settling somewhat, the bird.

438
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:45,440
What can you tell me of Mampang?

439
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:45,920
You ask.

440
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,299
Mampang!

441
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:50,299
Evil magic!

442
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:50,700
Evil!

443
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:52,460
Evil magic!

444
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,819
That's not even a bird.

445
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:57,819
That's just somebody that has the hiccups really bad today.

446
00:24:57,819 --> 00:25:02,079
But I'm gonna stay with it.

447
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:02,720
Mampang!

448
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,200
Evil magic!

449
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,000
Evil!

450
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,880
Finally the spell fades.

451
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,640
The bird settles back into the bushes.

452
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,220
You resume the climb up the endless stairs.

453
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,750
Hey, well we avoided a fight.

454
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,789
That's always a good thing.

455
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,039
That was a donkey.

456
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:27,819
Yeah, that was one step away from like...

457
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,500
Yeah, it's okay.

458
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,809
The sun is now sinking down.

459
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:34,690
Soon it will be dark.

460
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,980
You reach the top of the stairs.

461
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:40,049
Rounding the corner, you find three cave mouths set into the rock.

462
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:42,210
Three cave mouths.

463
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,809
Take a look.

464
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:47,900
You regard the caves with interest.

465
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:52,779
Middle cave has the smallest entrance and probably opens into a niche and nothing more.

466
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:55,339
The nearest cave would be large enough for a fire,

467
00:25:55,339 --> 00:25:58,380
but looks deep enough to contain any number of nasty surprises.

468
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:03,170
A series of hoof prints lead into the mouth of the furthest cave.

469
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:10,059
Okay, so the furthest cave, something obviously went in there.

470
00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:16,289
The middle cave is small, really small.

471
00:26:16,289 --> 00:26:20,369
And the closest one is big enough to go in there and sit down,

472
00:26:20,369 --> 00:26:23,900
but somebody might be in there.

473
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,740
Uh, look at the hoof prints.

474
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,299
You take a closer look at the hoof prints.

475
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:31,259
They are deep enough to suggest a largest creature,

476
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:33,740
but they are no longer fresh.

477
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,289
They're at least a few days old.

478
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:39,009
You also know that there are no prints coming out of the cave.

479
00:26:39,009 --> 00:26:40,579
Okay, so something's in there.

480
00:26:40,579 --> 00:26:45,730
What can I do?

481
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:56,500
Should I just throw just, just fucking bowling ball of fireball into one of them?

482
00:26:57,059 --> 00:26:59,519
Should I just throw a fireball?

483
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:02,559
That would be very rude.

484
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,410
Cause stupidity?

485
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,839
Hop? I could just throw a grenade.

486
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,259
Why would I throw, just roll a grenade?

487
00:27:12,259 --> 00:27:13,059
BLT!

488
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:19,200
You craft a BLT out of thin air.

489
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,880
Delicious mayo.

490
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,049
Crisp lettuce.

491
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:23,410
Crunchy bacon.

492
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,329
Juicy tomato slice.

493
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:31,329
You then squish it up into a ball and roll it into the furthest cave.

494
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,089
Okay, um, I don't know.

495
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,339
Open locks and doors.

496
00:27:42,339 --> 00:27:49,180
That's, I wonder.

497
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,740
There's no gob, so we can't do goblin.

498
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:54,940
It's really just throw a grenade or not.

499
00:27:55,819 --> 00:27:58,609
Heal disease.

500
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:03,170
Maybe there's somebody in there that's sick or something.

501
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:09,059
I could, ooh, I got it.

502
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:10,019
How about how?

503
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:10,900
Find safe passage.

504
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,779
Let's do it.

505
00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:17,390
You cast a spell and a familiar calm voice begins to speak to you.

506
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,059
Every cave has its dangers.

507
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,029
This voice informs you.

508
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:28,299
The smallest cave requires courage.

509
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:30,460
The largest, brawn.

510
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:35,539
But what the third cave requires you are never going to find out.

511
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:37,549
Goodbye.

512
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,099
What?

513
00:28:40,099 --> 00:28:43,789
The smallest cave requires courage.

514
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:45,630
The largest, brawn.

515
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:48,349
Aren't these kind of the same thing?

516
00:28:55,619 --> 00:28:58,500
What the, how do I know what one, two, and three is?

517
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:04,160
I'm gonna call out.

518
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,119
Who's there?

519
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:08,559
You call, hoping the owner of the hoofprints will appear, but there's no response.

520
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,000
The caves are unlikely to contain anything but nasty surprises, surely.

521
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:18,700
Okay, so this is, what did Bugleberry say?

522
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:20,500
Let me see.

523
00:29:23,619 --> 00:29:26,740
Okay, small, shallow is courage.

524
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,700
Large is, large is fight something, right, obviously.

525
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,579
The third cave requires you never find out.

526
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:36,220
So it's saying don't go in here.

527
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,259
It's, I might just die.

528
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:40,720
But that's sort of intriguing, isn't it?

529
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:48,700
I'm going in here.

530
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:50,000
Shallow.

531
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,920
Right in the middle.

532
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:59,940
You approach the smallest cave mouth and kneel down to peer inside.

533
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,380
You might be able to crawl inside, but it would be a tight squeeze.

534
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:08,380
I don't know if I want to, that would scare the shit out of anybody that was in here.

535
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:16,109
Okay.

536
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:20,769
Protect from magic, that might not be a bad idea.

537
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:24,019
Put the wig on and just start talking.

538
00:30:36,619 --> 00:30:37,259
Do big?

539
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,799
I don't think I can, I would just die.

540
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:43,619
I don't think big is even an option.

541
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,759
Summon replica.

542
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:52,509
Uh, there's, summon darkness.

543
00:30:52,509 --> 00:30:53,390
I wouldn't want to do that.

544
00:30:54,829 --> 00:30:56,269
Forcefield's not a bad idea either.

545
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:00,750
See the future.

546
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,869
I'm gonna do it.

547
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:07,710
You settle into a sitting position on the ground and take out the orb of crystal.

548
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:10,910
Looking to the stars, you craft the magic and suddenly you find yourself somewhere quite new.

549
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:15,940
You stand on a bridge slung across a deep chasm.

550
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:20,269
As you step on the planks of the wood, the bridge begins to whisper in your mind.

551
00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:26,339
Cruel and humiliating thoughts assail you.

552
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:33,740
Uh, step forward.

553
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,220
You take another step forward, but all your hope is gone.

554
00:31:36,859 --> 00:31:38,700
Your body feels like lead.

555
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,380
But then you find you are reaching into your pack and taking something out.

556
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,299
Slipping something onto your feet.

557
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:46,180
Look down.

558
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,250
You look down, hoping to see what you are wearing,

559
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:53,569
but catch sight of the dizzying drop below you and your head begins to swim.

560
00:31:53,569 --> 00:31:55,380
The vision fades.

561
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:00,539
As your eyes adjust to the darkness within, you can see that beyond the entrance,

562
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:02,700
the space opens up somewhat.

563
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,299
Opens out somewhat.

564
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:06,019
Looney Tunes?

565
00:32:06,019 --> 00:32:08,019
Yeah, that was kind of like a Wile E. Coyote bit.

566
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:11,119
I'm just gonna scream in here.

567
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:16,380
You call a wordless greeting into the cave mouth, listening for the echo.

568
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,470
Ready to react should you disturb any creatures.

569
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,410
Nothing stirs.

570
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:24,690
Then a shrill howling issues from the cave.

571
00:32:28,099 --> 00:32:29,380
Like, what am I even doing?

572
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,660
Do it again.

573
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:36,769
You call inside again a wordless cry of threat.

574
00:32:36,769 --> 00:32:42,299
Then wait, expecting something to rush you any moment, but still nothing emerges.

575
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:45,950
Toss a stone into the cave?

576
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:49,579
Am I gonna get rid of an item here?

577
00:32:49,579 --> 00:32:58,460
Hold on.

578
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,740
Yeah, that would be a pebble, right?

579
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,779
I don't think I'm gonna throw this.

580
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,490
Just live in this cave forever.

581
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:13,920
Hopefully that doesn't remove anything.

582
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,799
I'll try it.

583
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,660
Throw a stone in the cave.

584
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,259
You find a stone nearby and toss it into the cave.

585
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:22,210
Nothing happens at first.

586
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:25,250
A howl issues from the cave once more.

587
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:29,250
I'm gonna walk through here and just instantly die.

588
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,920
Crawl inside.

589
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:36,130
Stealing your courage, you crawl into the mouth of the cave.

590
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:37,730
Inside the cave.

591
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:42,420
You're barely through the entrance of the cave when the howling noise sounds again.

592
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,619
It is now somewhat, somewhere terribly close at hand.

593
00:33:45,619 --> 00:33:52,210
Just start stabbing out in the darkness?

594
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:54,450
Have a, um, let's get out.

595
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:57,599
Strike a light?

596
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:06,140
You could use the tinderbox to make a spark.

597
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,819
Burn the marsh goblin scroll.

598
00:34:07,819 --> 00:34:09,099
Burn my spell book.

599
00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:11,170
It's always the spell book.

600
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:12,449
No, don't burn anything.

601
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:14,909
I'm gonna wait.

602
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:21,250
Fucking zoombini.

603
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,969
You wait a moment and slowly your eyes adjust to the dark,

604
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:26,369
but you can still see nothing in the chamber.

605
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:28,610
Then a tiny creature brushes your leg.

606
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:42,369
Anybody get that one?

607
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:45,869
That was very specific.

608
00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:47,789
The thing is a jibjib.

609
00:34:47,789 --> 00:34:50,349
No more dangerous than an overgrown mouse.

610
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:53,440
I've retin the creature.

611
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,900
Get the fuck away from me.

612
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,920
Look at it.

613
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,119
Covered in fur and no larger than a bomba fruit.

614
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,159
Stands on two duck-like feet.

615
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:07,360
Its body must be mostly lungs as despite its size,

616
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,679
when it howls, it makes a noise like a horn.

617
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:26,139
I feel like it's kind of mean to just be mean to the little creature.

618
00:35:26,139 --> 00:35:29,409
No, I'm gonna leave the creature alone.

619
00:35:29,409 --> 00:35:30,210
You leave the creature.

620
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:33,889
It howls a few more times, but is beginning to realize you are not afraid.

621
00:35:33,889 --> 00:35:39,860
A moment later, it scurries away out of the cave.

622
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,570
Okay.

623
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,090
The cave appears otherwise empty.

624
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:47,090
This would be a dry, well-protected place to rest if it was nighttime,

625
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,820
but it is too early to sleep.

626
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,460
What time is it?

627
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,380
I'm not gonna eat.

628
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,840
I'll leave the cave.

629
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,320
There was just a little zoombini guy in there.

630
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,860
That's it.

631
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:03,460
I guess I could have threatened it.

632
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:08,739
Okay.

633
00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:11,139
The sun is almost set and the sky is a deep pink.

634
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:13,059
The path continues on past the other caves.

635
00:36:13,059 --> 00:36:15,139
Do I want to do any of the other caves?

636
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:20,210
I feel like I'm afraid to do it.

637
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:23,039
That one was no danger.

638
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:29,650
This one said I'm to be scared of this.

639
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,130
Why not?

640
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,409
I can always rewind it.

641
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:33,329
I have three rewinds.

642
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:35,440
Stepping towards the northernmost cave,

643
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,719
you see a few more sets of older hoof marks near to the mouth.

644
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:41,460
Let's see if we can appear in.

645
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,860
The cave appears to be deep, but quite empty.

646
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,579
Whatever creature made the hoof prints, it is either left another way

647
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:49,139
or is hiding in the furthest shadows.

648
00:36:52,699 --> 00:36:54,699
You draw your sword in preparation,

649
00:36:54,699 --> 00:36:57,340
feeling more secure with the metal in your hand.

650
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,139
Enter.

651
00:36:58,139 --> 00:37:01,329
You step inside the mouth of the cave.

652
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,650
Outside, night has fallen.

653
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,139
But in a moment, you stop.

654
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:07,860
We're sitting on a rock just inside the mouth of the cave.

655
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:08,980
It's a figure.

656
00:37:21,099 --> 00:37:26,420
Oh, you can really be a dick in this game.

657
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,019
You can you can truly be.

658
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,139
I'm just I'm just a maniac in this game.

659
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:33,940
You just I'm just gonna attack this person, but I'm not gonna.

660
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:42,590
The figure is in shadow, but it is human like and naked.

661
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:47,489
A long mane of hair sweeps down over its back, which is turned towards you.

662
00:37:47,489 --> 00:37:53,090
Clearly, you are treading quietly as the figure has not turned around.

663
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:56,880
Honestly, I'm not even sure this is a good idea.

664
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,840
Imagine just being I feel like somebody being like, hey, what's up, dude?

665
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,239
Somebody's in the fucking cave with me.

666
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:08,369
Like I would I would freak the fuck out.

667
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,250
Uh, what can I do?

668
00:38:15,489 --> 00:38:20,929
Oh, this is why you try to get all the items and it can be kind of a pain.

669
00:38:20,929 --> 00:38:23,250
But I can I can read this creature's mind.

670
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,480
That's even worse.

671
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:36,429
Not only am I saying hello, I'm saying hello telepathically.

672
00:38:39,539 --> 00:38:40,659
That would be awful.

673
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:46,980
Okay, you bind the starlight into shape around you, pulling on the cloth as you do so.

674
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:50,739
Why not greet the creature telepathically?

675
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,190
Greetings.

676
00:38:54,829 --> 00:38:58,690
You think, but there's no response as though you're not being heard.

677
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,420
Can I listen?

678
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:05,699
You focus and try to read the creature's thoughts.

679
00:39:05,699 --> 00:39:08,739
But despite reaching out with your mind, you sense nothing.

680
00:39:08,739 --> 00:39:14,659
Either it is shielded against magic or it is entirely without thoughts.

681
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:17,489
You remove the skull cap.

682
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:24,900
You sense that this creature cannot rotate a cube in their mind.

683
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,449
What do you do now?

684
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,309
Um, whatever.

685
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:39,650
Who is there?

686
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:40,289
You call out.

687
00:39:40,289 --> 00:39:42,210
The figure makes no reaction.

688
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:45,139
Call again.

689
00:39:45,699 --> 00:39:47,380
Will you not greet me?

690
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,559
Still nothing.

691
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:49,760
Perhaps the creature is deaf.

692
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,750
These are all bad.

693
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,349
These are all fucking bad.

694
00:39:54,349 --> 00:39:54,849
I don't.

695
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,860
All right.

696
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,940
You reach out to touch the creature's shoulder.

697
00:40:00,449 --> 00:40:04,130
The figure shudders a moment, then slides from its rock to the floor.

698
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,679
Oh, I think this creature is dead.

699
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:11,760
You look over the creature.

700
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,719
It is a woman with a human torso, but her legs are thick with hair and end in hooves.

701
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:22,159
Her face is a blend of human and goat-like features, and two short horns rise from her

702
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:23,119
forehead.

703
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:29,760
She is quite clearly dead.

704
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,400
Bury?

705
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,280
Bury the body?

706
00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:32,869
Search?

707
00:40:33,329 --> 00:40:33,829
Leave?

708
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:40,800
Can I?

709
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,300
Okay, can I?

710
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,460
I'm going to bury.

711
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:44,920
Search?

712
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,880
Do you have?

713
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,280
Does it?

714
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,239
Did she have a pack?

715
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:52,530
Oh, okay.

716
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:53,489
She's carrying nothing.

717
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:54,849
Her skin is quite cold.

718
00:40:54,849 --> 00:40:55,570
All right, we're going to bury.

719
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,369
We're going to bury the body.

720
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:04,289
It is hard work digging in the dirt of the cave floor with your assassin's sword, but

721
00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:09,340
after an hour or so, you've made a pit deep enough to roll the body into.

722
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:13,820
You lay it down as gently as you can, and then move the dirt back over it once more.

723
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:16,530
The dust clears, and you are left quite alone.

724
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,519
Digging with a...

725
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,360
Yeah, how the fuck would you dig with a sword?

726
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:22,800
Use your hands.

727
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,079
That'd be way more effective.

728
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,250
Um, I should...

729
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:29,969
I'm going to sleep here.

730
00:41:30,369 --> 00:41:32,960
You should be safe here.

731
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,440
Laying your pack down, you try to settle despite the hard floor.

732
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,960
You've not eaten yet today.

733
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:41,170
Uh, I'll eat something.

734
00:41:41,809 --> 00:41:44,130
You eat an apple and feel much better for it.

735
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:46,610
Then you close your eyes and let your tiredness overtake you.

736
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:48,820
Dream.

737
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,980
What is left of the night is filled with visions.

738
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,380
Jibjibs are bouncing past you, appearing from all sides.

739
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,860
Their maniac eyes are all but popping from their heads.

740
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:04,940
You are standing on top of a tall, black-tiled tower, clinging onto its tiles with one hand.

741
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:08,639
With the other, you wave something in the air.

742
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:11,940
What is it?

743
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,780
You look in your hand to find you are holding nothing less than the crown itself.

744
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:21,820
Then, you hear a cawing sound, and a great shape moves towards you.

745
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,170
A birdman?

746
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:27,699
No, a gold-crested eagle, shimmering into view.

747
00:42:27,699 --> 00:42:29,059
The Sightmasters have seen you.

748
00:42:29,059 --> 00:42:36,539
They are taking you home!

749
00:42:36,539 --> 00:42:40,699
You ate one provision, explored the caves of Pyzamen, and began your ascent into the mountains.

750
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,579
The Archmage remains unaware of you.

751
00:42:43,579 --> 00:42:45,710
That's really...

752
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:46,909
That's actually a huge deal.

753
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:54,780
You wake to the sunlight spilling through the cave mouth.

754
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,699
I just ate, so I don't need to eat again.

755
00:42:56,699 --> 00:43:04,699
You head outside once more, leaving the solemn earth mound behind.

756
00:43:04,699 --> 00:43:05,900
Sun breaks over the horizon.

757
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:06,699
I guess I could...

758
00:43:06,699 --> 00:43:07,739
This one, I don't want to fight.

759
00:43:07,739 --> 00:43:08,539
Whatever it is in there.

760
00:43:08,539 --> 00:43:09,340
So I'm just going to keep going.

761
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,440
You leave the caves behind.

762
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:20,239
The steps are becoming wider as the path turns to follow the edge of a deep chasm.

763
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:22,420
Walk on.

764
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:27,519
A little further on, a rock ledge juts out into the chasm to post-stand on either side.

765
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:31,119
The narrow and rather ancient wooden bridge lashed to them.

766
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:32,670
Okay.

767
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:36,929
I think this is the bridge in the future thing.

768
00:43:36,929 --> 00:43:40,980
What's the goal of part four?

769
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:45,840
The goal of part four is to go find the Archmage and go get the crown.

770
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,599
All right, look at the bridge.

771
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,110
The bridge must be a hundred years old at least.

772
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:56,750
It is set into timber supports driven deep into fixtures out of sight below the ledge.

773
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:00,320
Seems like it might still be solid.

774
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,679
Uh, okay.

775
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:08,130
I have to be careful because I think I'm going to fall.

776
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:13,260
You glance down at the path ahead and see a line of hoof prints similar to those you saw outside the cave.

777
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,019
They lead a way past the bridge.

778
00:44:18,769 --> 00:44:21,699
Okay.

779
00:44:21,699 --> 00:44:25,539
You lift your eyes to look across the chasm to the other side where more mountains rise up.

780
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:29,039
A cleft line in their peaks traces a narrow road,

781
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:32,159
and atop one summit is what looks like a large bird's nest.

782
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:34,780
Cross the bridge and move on.

783
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:35,340
I don't want to throw it.

784
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,460
I want to keep my money.

785
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:38,800
Okay, time to continue.

786
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,139
If the bridge is sound, it would get you quickly closer to the citadel.

787
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:44,980
And if somebody said, can you zoom out?

788
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,690
Yes, I can.

789
00:44:47,869 --> 00:44:50,659
Here is Bampang.

790
00:44:50,659 --> 00:44:58,210
Got a little ways to go before we get there though.

791
00:44:58,210 --> 00:44:58,610
All right.

792
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:01,489
Uh, this looks kind of interesting.

793
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:04,639
The bridge, I don't know if it's safe.

794
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,199
It might be.

795
00:45:06,739 --> 00:45:08,900
But I kind of want to go this way.

796
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:17,980
This is much longer, but I feel like kind of interesting.

797
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:23,119
All right, let's go to the winding path.

798
00:45:26,019 --> 00:45:27,059
You guys just got Elden Ringed.

799
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:27,860
That's right.

800
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:31,440
When you make your way along the track, then pause for breath.

801
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,559
The air stirs a little, still cold, but fresh at least.

802
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:37,539
A jutting rock sticks out just by the edge of the ravine.

803
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:41,699
Look at the rock.

804
00:45:41,699 --> 00:45:46,579
The rock is like a hooked claw poking out of the edge of the chasm and looking out over the drop.

805
00:45:46,659 --> 00:45:50,639
The far face is grown over with thick, fleshy green moss.

806
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:51,920
Ooh, green moss.

807
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:53,599
Why did I say it like that?

808
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:56,719
Ooh, actually green moss.

809
00:45:56,719 --> 00:45:58,909
You grab a handful of the moss.

810
00:45:58,909 --> 00:46:00,929
It feels juicy and fresh.

811
00:46:00,929 --> 00:46:01,969
I'm going to take it.

812
00:46:01,969 --> 00:46:03,329
No, not taste it.

813
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:07,710
Oh, I guess I can just eat it.

814
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:09,969
Eat it.

815
00:46:09,969 --> 00:46:10,769
Healing warmth.

816
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:13,119
Yeah, we got full health though.

817
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,940
Look into the ravine.

818
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:19,539
The ravine on the north side of the path is deep, but not impossibly so.

819
00:46:19,539 --> 00:46:24,619
A sheer drop becomes softer as the ground curves towards grassland within view.

820
00:46:24,619 --> 00:46:26,900
Let me take a look.

821
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:27,860
I could do this.

822
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:36,000
I technically could drop the rope down, go this way, and come up here.

823
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:39,139
I think that's what that's implying.

824
00:46:39,699 --> 00:46:40,820
Investigate whatever this is.

825
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:45,619
Or just keep going the long way down this path.

826
00:46:45,619 --> 00:46:50,849
I think I want to go the long way.

827
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:55,090
Look, this is part four.

828
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:56,130
This is the final part.

829
00:46:56,849 --> 00:46:58,880
So let's not skip it.

830
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,639
Let's take our time with it.

831
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:01,920
Let's go the long way.

832
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,039
Yeah, that's riskier.

833
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:10,159
I'll probably take damage doing that.

834
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:17,139
Okay, up the path.

835
00:47:17,139 --> 00:47:22,860
The path crosses a rocky plateau which rises gradually.

836
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:25,179
Few clouds move across the heavens.

837
00:47:25,739 --> 00:47:30,380
You're almost in the peaks now, with sheer drops opening on either side.

838
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:34,059
The plateau is relatively sheltered, but there's no time to waste here.

839
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,000
Ooh, okay, let's keep going.

840
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:45,739
A sheer rock wall stretches high on your right, while a drop is to your left.

841
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,539
Follow the path as it curves around.

842
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:50,699
As the morning moves on, the wind begins to rise.

843
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:54,989
The path quickly narrows, and you have to press yourself against the wall at times.

844
00:47:55,650 --> 00:48:00,929
You follow the trail around a corner, stopping short in view of a jutting ledge.

845
00:48:00,929 --> 00:48:04,699
The path turns to fresh mud, pressed with hoof prints.

846
00:48:11,789 --> 00:48:12,590
Take a look.

847
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:18,000
The prints are similar to the ones you saw before outside the cave.

848
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,480
Could they be more of the goat people here?

849
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,460
You continue upwards, sweating under your pack, head low.

850
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:31,150
But as you wind around a bend, a voice like gravel calls out,

851
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:32,110
Halt!

852
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:41,619
You stop, in your tracks, and a rock strikes you on the temple.

853
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:42,619
What?

854
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:47,099
Looking sharply up, you see two creatures, each half human and half goat.

855
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:50,460
Perched against the southern slope, spears held ready.

856
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:55,969
What is your business?

857
00:48:55,969 --> 00:48:56,929
One demands.

858
00:48:56,929 --> 00:49:01,840
Okay, so here are the goat people.

859
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,760
Who are you?

860
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,119
I mean you no harm.

861
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:07,900
I discovered one of your companions.

862
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,579
Hey, I think this is it.

863
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:13,119
I discovered one- should I say that immediately,

864
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:15,329
or are they gonna throw another rock at my head?

865
00:49:15,329 --> 00:49:21,250
I discovered one of your companions.

866
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:24,179
One lowers her spear.

867
00:49:24,179 --> 00:49:26,030
Where?

868
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:26,989
In a cave.

869
00:49:26,989 --> 00:49:30,079
She is dead.

870
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:37,150
Uh, shit.

871
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:39,360
In a cave.

872
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,000
How was she?

873
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:41,280
She demands.

874
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,320
Her concern is clear.

875
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:45,860
Dead.

876
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,380
That's not a nice way to say that.

877
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:50,380
How was she?

878
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:55,889
Dead.

879
00:49:55,889 --> 00:50:00,050
I have to say this though, because if I lie and they go find out that she's dead,

880
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:01,650
they're gonna think I did it.

881
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:03,619
Dead.

882
00:50:03,619 --> 00:50:05,789
Dead.

883
00:50:05,789 --> 00:50:07,820
As expected.

884
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,340
You must have discovered.

885
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,199
She himbly.

886
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:13,840
She disappeared a few nights ago.

887
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:18,400
She was very ill, and I suspect she left to prevent her disease from spreading to others.

888
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,119
Oh, fuck.

889
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:29,179
It is hard to hear of her fate, but I am glad you told us of her sacrifice.

890
00:50:29,179 --> 00:50:30,940
Forgive my curiosity.

891
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:33,340
The second goat woman says.

892
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:35,179
But where are you traveling from?

893
00:50:35,179 --> 00:50:45,380
Just walk away.

894
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:48,619
Uh, tell them something.

895
00:50:48,619 --> 00:50:51,230
You take a moment to prepare a reply.

896
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:55,679
Are these creatures servants of the Archmage, or are they his enemies?

897
00:50:55,679 --> 00:51:00,030
I come from Anorland, and I journey to Mampang.

898
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:02,590
From Kare, off to sell goods in Mampang.

899
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:05,570
From the southern plains, with no destination in mind.

900
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:11,489
Let's just go.

901
00:51:11,489 --> 00:51:12,769
Let's just tell the truth.

902
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:17,760
I come from Anorland, and I journey to Mampang.

903
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:24,690
You declare, unafraid, who should hear your words.

904
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:25,409
Mampang!

905
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:27,650
Ah, the curse in place.

906
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:30,110
And what is your purpose?

907
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:34,099
I will recover the crown of kings.

908
00:51:34,099 --> 00:51:36,610
To find a lost heirloom.

909
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:43,309
I will not say.

910
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:48,110
Uh, to find a lost heirloom.

911
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:49,710
Do not mock us, stranger.

912
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:54,690
We are an isolated people, but even we know respect.

913
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:56,449
Unlike yourself, it seems.

914
00:51:56,449 --> 00:52:00,929
Do not test me.

915
00:52:00,929 --> 00:52:03,500
I'm not used to strangers.

916
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:08,320
I mean no offense.

917
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,460
Do not test me.

918
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:18,980
I am sorry, I'm not used to talking to strangers.

919
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:20,019
As we are not.

920
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:22,659
I suppose there was no harm done?

921
00:52:22,659 --> 00:52:23,940
The creature nods.

922
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:27,230
Please, come with us.

923
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:30,670
Shihori will wish to hear what you have to say.

924
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:33,789
The hoofborns turn and begin to climb up a side path.

925
00:52:33,789 --> 00:52:35,710
It's what we're doing right now.

926
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:38,750
We will take you to our village, if you are willing.

927
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:45,949
Who is Shihori?

928
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:49,090
Our leader.

929
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:50,130
The best of us.

930
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:51,409
The first.

931
00:52:51,409 --> 00:52:51,969
You will come?

932
00:52:54,019 --> 00:52:55,380
I cannot come with you.

933
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,099
I cannot climb.

934
00:52:56,099 --> 00:52:56,900
I cannot.

935
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:57,780
It's true.

936
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,300
My back hurts, and my legs hurt.

937
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,179
I can't come.

938
00:53:00,179 --> 00:53:00,820
I'm sorry.

939
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:02,739
Maybe another time.

940
00:53:02,739 --> 00:53:04,989
Lead the way.

941
00:53:04,989 --> 00:53:05,710
Take me with you.

942
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:10,590
The two hoofborns sling their spears and beckon you to one side.

943
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:14,349
Through a narrow way, almost invisible behind an outcrop of stone.

944
00:53:14,349 --> 00:53:17,739
And then you begin to climb.

945
00:53:17,739 --> 00:53:19,099
Into the peaks.

946
00:53:19,099 --> 00:53:24,460
As the sun climbs the sky, the winds begin to rise.

947
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:28,699
After about 20 minutes of climbing, the hoofborns pause to let you catch your breath.

948
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:34,500
They are impressively nimble on the rocky paths, using their small hooves to perch on

949
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,539
narrow ledges.

950
00:53:35,539 --> 00:53:39,900
As you continue, they even have to help you climb up unstable stretches.

951
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:43,760
Eventually, you spot a cluster of huts surrounding some caves.

952
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,579
Approach the village.

953
00:53:48,579 --> 00:53:51,280
This is elaborate.

954
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:55,010
You follow your guides towards the village.

955
00:53:55,010 --> 00:54:00,300
On an outcrop above, you spy two hoofborns standing guard, spears and rocks at the ready.

956
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:04,769
It seems these creatures take their protections seriously.

957
00:54:04,769 --> 00:54:06,940
Now, you find Shihori.

958
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:09,179
One of your guides says to you,

959
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:12,219
She will be keen to hear of our companion's fate.

960
00:54:12,219 --> 00:54:15,230
I will talk to her.

961
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:17,090
The hoofborn nod.

962
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:20,690
All right, well, we got a whole village here.

963
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:26,380
The village outskirts.

964
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:28,940
Your guides grow quiet as you enter the village.

965
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:32,460
There are a few well-maintained huts, but it is clear many of the hoofborns live in

966
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:34,219
holes in the cliff face.

967
00:54:34,219 --> 00:54:37,250
Let's take a look.

968
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:39,730
From the outside, the caves appear clean and spacious.

969
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:42,769
A surprising number of hoofborns stream out to gawk at you.

970
00:54:42,769 --> 00:54:47,230
These caves must honeycomb the entire mountainside.

971
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:51,150
An older hoofborn, draped in several hides, emerges from a larger cave.

972
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:55,760
One of your guides extends her arm straight out.

973
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,460
Shihori, Shihori, we have brought a visitor.

974
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:04,050
Shihori stretches her arms towards you, just as the guide did.

975
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:04,690
Welcome.

976
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:08,210
We do not entertain often.

977
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:14,780
You open your arms to begin casting a spell, but Shihori knocks your wrist apart with a

978
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:17,460
swift movement of the butt of her spear.

979
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:22,190
Do not think we do not understand the ways of sorcerers.

980
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:27,309
I know that to sever a sorcerer's hand is to remove their power.

981
00:55:27,309 --> 00:55:29,469
Do not test me on my resolve.

982
00:55:34,099 --> 00:55:34,989
Oops.

983
00:55:34,989 --> 00:55:37,630
Sorry.

984
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:40,239
Accepted.

985
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:42,000
I found one of your villagers in a cave.

986
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:47,949
You tell her, relating your discovery of the dead hoofborn girl.

987
00:55:47,949 --> 00:55:50,739
Ah yes, that was Shehimbli.

988
00:55:50,739 --> 00:55:51,860
The poor creature.

989
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:57,570
She caught a terrible disease and rather than risk the village, she slipped out at night.

990
00:55:57,570 --> 00:56:01,360
A scout saw her heading downslope looking for a place to die.

991
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,440
What disease?

992
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,179
The trembling sickness.

993
00:56:08,179 --> 00:56:12,179
The plagues are kind and stalks the mountains like a vengeful ghost.

994
00:56:12,179 --> 00:56:16,670
The creature looks up at you with large, bleary, goat-like eyes.

995
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:19,710
What did you do with her body?

996
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,010
She asks.

997
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:22,929
I buried it.

998
00:56:22,929 --> 00:56:23,969
I burned it.

999
00:56:23,969 --> 00:56:24,610
Nothing.

1000
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:28,849
I buried it.

1001
00:56:28,849 --> 00:56:33,599
Then I must ask you to leave us.

1002
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,840
Trembling sickness is most infectious.

1003
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:40,579
We cannot take the chance.

1004
00:56:40,579 --> 00:56:41,780
I am not ill.

1005
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:44,320
She looks uncertain.

1006
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,079
You do not seem to have the symptoms.

1007
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:50,500
Even as her spear point comes up.

1008
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:56,019
The girl had been dead for some time.

1009
00:56:56,019 --> 00:56:58,980
You tell her, whatever disease she had was gone from her bones.

1010
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,599
How the fuck do I know that?

1011
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:02,880
What am I, a doctor?

1012
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:03,760
Like a scientist?

1013
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,800
How would I know that?

1014
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:10,510
Shehori stares at you and shakes her head.

1015
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:13,329
She lowers her spear.

1016
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:15,650
I hope you are not lying to us, stranger.

1017
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:19,039
We have lost too many to the disease already.

1018
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:21,980
Shehori looks to your guide.

1019
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:25,519
From where does this one come?

1020
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:27,070
Anorand.

1021
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:29,389
He claims to be on a quest.

1022
00:57:29,389 --> 00:57:30,269
Is that so?

1023
00:57:30,269 --> 00:57:32,429
She don't tell-

1024
00:57:32,429 --> 00:57:36,829
Ooh, it's a secret.

1025
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:37,550
Indeed.

1026
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:41,760
Do not tell me your purpose.

1027
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,099
I just wish to know this.

1028
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:46,019
Will it harm the Archmage?

1029
00:57:46,019 --> 00:57:49,260
Well, I mean, I hope so.

1030
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:49,980
I hope so.

1031
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:51,550
I hope so.

1032
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:53,739
Greatly.

1033
00:57:53,739 --> 00:57:54,380
Greatly.

1034
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,340
Excellent.

1035
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,500
But you must be careful in Mampang.

1036
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:02,880
It is a chaotic place and cruel.

1037
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:08,340
The Archmage wields complete control, but does not always exercise it.

1038
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:12,980
Petty crimes and suffering go unnoticed, but you will not.

1039
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:15,409
He espies all of us, Amun.

1040
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:20,300
It is likely he knows you are coming.

1041
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:21,980
I took care of his serpents.

1042
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:24,320
I do not think he does, not yet.

1043
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,340
I will be wary.

1044
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,719
I took care of his serpents.

1045
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:30,739
Did you?

1046
00:58:30,739 --> 00:58:34,929
Then perhaps you have a chance after all.

1047
00:58:34,929 --> 00:58:36,289
Uh, can I come in?

1048
00:58:36,289 --> 00:58:37,659
Can I enter your village?

1049
00:58:37,659 --> 00:58:42,909
The hoof-borne leader makes a cantering step backwards and ducks her head.

1050
00:58:42,909 --> 00:58:44,159
Feel free.

1051
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:45,519
Eat and rest.

1052
00:58:45,519 --> 00:58:46,559
You will be watched.

1053
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:56,349
We also have items to trade, if you are willing.

1054
00:58:56,349 --> 00:58:57,710
You're diseased.

1055
00:58:57,710 --> 00:59:01,949
I, that's not confirmed.

1056
00:59:01,949 --> 00:59:03,389
I'm, that's not confirmed.

1057
00:59:18,909 --> 00:59:19,949
I am not.

1058
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:25,099
Fuck.

1059
00:59:25,099 --> 00:59:26,380
But how, I don't know.

1060
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:28,460
How long was she dead in there for?

1061
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:31,730
Because that's a good point.

1062
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:37,570
Like, how, it's been a while, right?

1063
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:38,929
You step into the center of the village.

1064
00:59:39,489 --> 00:59:42,929
The watching hoof-borne gradually disperse back into their groups.

1065
00:59:42,929 --> 00:59:45,889
Some into caves, and others go to a gathering around a fire.

1066
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:49,469
Ooh, a few places to go.

1067
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:55,889
Uh, I got money, so let's go to the trader.

1068
00:59:55,889 --> 01:00:02,059
Against one rock face, a thin hoof-borne stands beside a few broken packing crates

1069
01:00:02,059 --> 01:00:03,579
stocked with trinkets.

1070
01:00:03,579 --> 01:00:05,760
He raises his hand as you approach in greeting.

1071
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,500
Greetings.

1072
01:00:11,659 --> 01:00:13,579
This is, uh, what we have.

1073
01:00:13,579 --> 01:00:15,389
The trader tells you.

1074
01:00:15,389 --> 01:00:16,989
I'm afraid this is not much.

1075
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:19,309
Perhaps something here will be of interest.

1076
01:00:19,309 --> 01:00:23,389
From across the clearing, you hear Shihori call out.

1077
01:00:23,389 --> 01:00:26,349
Treat this one fairly, Rohan.

1078
01:00:26,349 --> 01:00:28,269
He is a friend to our kind.

1079
01:00:28,269 --> 01:00:32,139
The trader nods.

1080
01:00:32,139 --> 01:00:33,980
Who do you trade with?

1081
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:35,420
You ask, somewhat puzzled.

1082
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:37,760
The poor creature shrugs slightly.

1083
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,489
You are the first.

1084
01:00:39,489 --> 01:00:44,420
But one day, I hope to open a true trading post.

1085
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:45,619
You peer into the crates.

1086
01:00:45,619 --> 01:00:49,760
The creature has a curious assortment of items.

1087
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,150
Why is he, why is he German?

1088
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,510
I don't know.

1089
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:58,340
I looked over at chat, and I saw somebody say.

1090
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:00,980
One year later, one voice.

1091
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:02,260
And I said, you know what?

1092
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:04,420
Fucking next one's gonna be German, okay?

1093
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:05,619
That's what happened.

1094
01:01:05,619 --> 01:01:06,739
That is the truth.

1095
01:01:06,739 --> 01:01:10,340
That is what happened.

1096
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:11,380
That's just the truth.

1097
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:12,739
I have to tell you the truth.

1098
01:01:12,739 --> 01:01:16,099
You peer into the crates.

1099
01:01:16,099 --> 01:01:18,179
The creature has a curious assortment of items.

1100
01:01:18,179 --> 01:01:20,420
Some most likely highly valuable.

1101
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:23,139
Others all but worthless.

1102
01:01:23,139 --> 01:01:25,280
It is almost a parody of a shop.

1103
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,500
The crates are all labeled in scrawled writing.

1104
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:32,340
The first is marked six gold, and the second 12 gold.

1105
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:34,340
A spear leans against one of the crates.

1106
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:38,050
Okay, well look in the expensive crate.

1107
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:42,059
You scan the items in the high-priced crate.

1108
01:01:42,059 --> 01:01:44,300
A brass rod with a weight.

1109
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:48,800
You lift a brass rod, which turns out to be a pendulum,

1110
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,460
with a gently pivoted handle at its top.

1111
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:54,659
It swings with an easy weight until the trader catches it.

1112
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:56,510
None of that.

1113
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:59,420
I won't have you casting any sleeping spells on me.

1114
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:04,800
Okay.

1115
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:05,760
Of course not.

1116
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:09,570
What shopkeeper would fall for that?

1117
01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:11,699
Indeed.

1118
01:02:11,699 --> 01:02:14,219
Um, what was this, 12?

1119
01:02:14,219 --> 01:02:15,019
12 gold?

1120
01:02:15,019 --> 01:02:29,139
That's a lot of money.

1121
01:02:29,139 --> 01:02:30,989
You can never have too many items, though.

1122
01:02:30,989 --> 01:02:31,710
I'll get it.

1123
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:35,389
A long brass pendulum only just fits into your backpack.

1124
01:02:35,389 --> 01:02:36,829
You hand over 12 gold pieces.

1125
01:02:36,829 --> 01:02:37,550
You look up once more.

1126
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:40,349
There's nothing else in this box.

1127
01:02:40,349 --> 01:02:43,409
Look in the cheap crate.

1128
01:02:43,409 --> 01:02:45,250
The cheaper crate is mostly empty,

1129
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:46,940
and you have to dig to find anything

1130
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:50,619
amongst the sawdust in which things are kept.

1131
01:02:50,619 --> 01:02:53,059
A glass bottle.

1132
01:02:53,059 --> 01:02:55,329
A pair of nose plugs.

1133
01:02:55,329 --> 01:02:56,369
Orange rock dust.

1134
01:02:56,369 --> 01:02:58,659
An apple.

1135
01:02:58,659 --> 01:03:01,619
Uh, I think that's for, like, the smelly spell.

1136
01:03:01,619 --> 01:03:02,880
Hold on.

1137
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:16,380
Let's see.

1138
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:17,900
Yep.

1139
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:18,619
It's nif.

1140
01:03:19,489 --> 01:03:23,010
The spell causes the air to fill with a nauseating stench so vile

1141
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:26,400
that any creature catching a whiff will need to vomit.

1142
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,239
This includes the caster.

1143
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:30,179
Unless they are wearing nose plugs.

1144
01:03:30,179 --> 01:03:34,460
The effect is more pronounced on creatures with large noses.

1145
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:41,630
Okay, so it's the puke spell.

1146
01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:42,670
Uh, how much?

1147
01:03:42,670 --> 01:03:45,860
No, I didn't want to click that.

1148
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:48,260
The orange dust is piled in one corner of the crate,

1149
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:52,559
but when you ask, the hoofhorn assures you it is for sale.

1150
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:54,690
Finest ambergrind.

1151
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:56,050
Better than xerost.

1152
01:03:56,050 --> 01:03:58,380
Even if you know what to do with it.

1153
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:02,900
That was all of Europe in one accent.

1154
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:03,300
I don't know.

1155
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:04,820
That was remarkable how that happened.

1156
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:06,940
Okay.

1157
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:14,579
Um, what can I do with it?

1158
01:04:14,579 --> 01:04:15,380
And what is that?

1159
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:20,880
I am no sorcerer.

1160
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:21,760
Orange dust?

1161
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:22,400
What is it?

1162
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:26,420
What is orange dust used for?

1163
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:26,820
Sand?

1164
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:31,219
Firewater?

1165
01:04:31,219 --> 01:04:31,619
Mirror?

1166
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:33,869
Yellow powder?

1167
01:04:33,869 --> 01:04:37,900
I mean, it's orange.

1168
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:38,780
It was clearly orange.

1169
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:47,949
Sun jewel.

1170
01:04:47,949 --> 01:04:48,750
I have most of these.

1171
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:54,929
Orb.

1172
01:04:55,489 --> 01:05:00,739
It's an option to ask what it is.

1173
01:05:01,699 --> 01:05:02,820
I don't think he knows.

1174
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:04,099
He said, I'm not a sorcerer.

1175
01:05:04,099 --> 01:05:04,739
How would I know?

1176
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:06,579
Why would he own it?

1177
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:10,269
Hey, what's this for?

1178
01:05:10,829 --> 01:05:12,510
It was orange and I picked it up off the ground.

1179
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:16,289
Maybe it is just like sand.

1180
01:05:16,929 --> 01:05:30,940
I mean, I got money.

1181
01:05:31,739 --> 01:05:33,139
I got money.

1182
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:37,360
How much was it?

1183
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:38,320
Six gold, right?

1184
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:38,800
I got money.

1185
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:39,280
I'll buy it.

1186
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:42,539
You pour the orange rock dust carefully into your pouch.

1187
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:43,500
You pay the merchant.

1188
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:45,730
You scan the remaining items in the crate.

1189
01:05:45,730 --> 01:05:47,329
Uh, how much are the nose plugs?

1190
01:05:47,329 --> 01:05:48,369
Six, right?

1191
01:05:48,369 --> 01:05:48,849
Yep.

1192
01:05:48,849 --> 01:05:49,730
Definitely want those.

1193
01:05:51,309 --> 01:05:53,489
A glass bottle.

1194
01:05:53,489 --> 01:05:55,489
Clear liquid inside of a glass bottle.

1195
01:05:55,489 --> 01:05:56,610
What does it smell like?

1196
01:05:56,610 --> 01:05:58,300
You go to remove the stopper.

1197
01:05:59,019 --> 01:05:59,500
What the?

1198
01:05:59,500 --> 01:05:59,820
Hold on.

1199
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:00,460
Let me do that better.

1200
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:06,510
You go to remove the stopper, but the hoof bone stops you.

1201
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:07,550
It's fire water.

1202
01:06:08,269 --> 01:06:11,070
It evaporates extremely fast once exposed to air.

1203
01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:17,900
So buy it if you want to drink it.

1204
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:18,780
Oh, I want that.

1205
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:22,909
Give it to me.

1206
01:06:22,909 --> 01:06:23,389
Okay.

1207
01:06:23,389 --> 01:06:25,539
What about an apple?

1208
01:06:25,539 --> 01:06:29,139
An old apple sits in sawdust in surprisingly good condition,

1209
01:06:29,139 --> 01:06:31,570
considering it must've been here for some time.

1210
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:32,690
Uh, it's food.

1211
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:35,469
I want it.

1212
01:06:35,469 --> 01:06:37,630
Oh shit.

1213
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:41,070
There's a spear.

1214
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:43,780
You lift the spear and the trader nods.

1215
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:47,519
It is a blessed hardwood spear, which is virtually unbreakable.

1216
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:52,610
And very expensive indeed.

1217
01:06:52,610 --> 01:06:53,489
How much?

1218
01:06:53,489 --> 01:06:57,099
A 70 gold pieces.

1219
01:06:57,099 --> 01:06:58,619
That is robbery.

1220
01:06:58,619 --> 01:07:01,250
But the trader shrugs.

1221
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:04,300
No, robbery would be anything else.

1222
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:05,619
But nevermind.

1223
01:07:05,619 --> 01:07:08,349
You need not buy it after all.

1224
01:07:08,349 --> 01:07:09,469
I have seen enough.

1225
01:07:09,469 --> 01:07:11,389
You thank the trader and move away.

1226
01:07:11,389 --> 01:07:19,300
How would you ever have 70 gold at this point in the fourth game?

1227
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:21,679
70 gold.

1228
01:07:21,679 --> 01:07:24,079
I guess if you just didn't buy a bunch of bullshit like I did.

1229
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:26,030
Okay.

1230
01:07:26,030 --> 01:07:26,750
I've seen enough.

1231
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:27,789
Thank the trader and move away.

1232
01:07:27,789 --> 01:07:28,510
The village is small.

1233
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:30,429
There could be more than a hundred.

1234
01:07:30,429 --> 01:07:35,619
It could be not more than a hundred inhabitants.

1235
01:07:35,619 --> 01:07:40,530
Uh, this is shihori.

1236
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:45,199
Fire.

1237
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:48,670
And viewpoint.

1238
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:49,789
Sell your teeth.

1239
01:07:49,789 --> 01:07:51,730
I think there was only one place I could do that.

1240
01:07:51,730 --> 01:07:55,280
Let me go look at the viewpoint.

1241
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,639
On the north side of the village is a lookout point that offers a spectacular view across

1242
01:07:58,639 --> 01:08:00,320
the valley below.

1243
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:04,800
You stay for a while, watching birdmen circling the peaks across the ravine to the north.

1244
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,960
One of the hoof-born comes to join you.

1245
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:12,260
They are cruel creatures born of pure hate.

1246
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:19,310
But they say they are nesting in the mountains outside Manhang.

1247
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:20,989
All birds make nests.

1248
01:08:20,989 --> 01:08:22,909
We are not birds.

1249
01:08:22,909 --> 01:08:24,510
No more than we are goats.

1250
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:27,890
Birdmen cannot have children of their own.

1251
01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:31,229
Only the Archmage can birth them.

1252
01:08:31,229 --> 01:08:35,710
Looking around, you suddenly notice the tru-eees had he said something true.

1253
01:08:36,579 --> 01:08:39,060
In the whole village, you have not seen a single infant.

1254
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:53,229
Oh, that's like, that has, that's like top five best chat message of the last like month.

1255
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:54,109
Oh my goodness.

1256
01:08:54,829 --> 01:08:59,520
Uh, somebody said from software Trump.

1257
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:00,479
God damn it.

1258
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:03,180
Like, don't you just get mad when you don't, like, I wish I thought of that.

1259
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:07,869
Like, I wish I thought of something that funny.

1260
01:09:07,869 --> 01:09:09,310
That's so funny.

1261
01:09:09,310 --> 01:09:11,149
Okay, well, I'm gonna, that's what I'm doing.

1262
01:09:11,149 --> 01:09:16,050
That's what this person sounds like.

1263
01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:20,449
So, I don't even remember how, I don't even remember, I don't remember the voice now because

1264
01:09:20,449 --> 01:09:22,850
I'm so, I'm thinking about it too much.

1265
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:25,439
So why do they build nests?

1266
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:27,279
The hoof-born man shakes his head.

1267
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:28,640
I do not know.

1268
01:09:29,710 --> 01:09:31,630
It's a mystery.

1269
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:36,770
Perhaps they believe that nests will make eggs come.

1270
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:37,649
I cannot say.

1271
01:09:39,149 --> 01:09:50,100
You cannot have children of your own.

1272
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:51,060
We cannot.

1273
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:55,060
The hoof-born strikes his chest with a palm.

1274
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:57,470
Ow, I did that in real life.

1275
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:59,859
Go in peace, stranger.

1276
01:10:05,970 --> 01:10:06,689
Believe me.

1277
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:14,500
Uh, the fire.

1278
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:17,840
You go over to the fire and sit down with the gathered hoof-born.

1279
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:21,119
They're sharing out a meal that smells of oranges and charred wood.

1280
01:10:23,310 --> 01:10:24,270
Uh, I will eat.

1281
01:10:24,829 --> 01:10:28,880
You sit with the hoof-born and share their meal.

1282
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:33,840
It is a greasy chunk of meat with some kind of sweet glaze that smells of oranges.

1283
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,460
It sits in a bowl of small grains and is very filling.

1284
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:37,500
That sounds good.

1285
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:40,420
That sounds great, actually.

1286
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:41,460
Doesn't that sound good?

1287
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:52,289
Ah, fresh water with some delicious...

1288
01:10:52,289 --> 01:10:54,670
What's in here?

1289
01:10:54,670 --> 01:11:02,159
I put something in it.

1290
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:03,039
No, not vodka.

1291
01:11:07,229 --> 01:11:09,149
Yeah, I put vodka in my water.

1292
01:11:09,149 --> 01:11:09,789
No, what?

1293
01:11:11,550 --> 01:11:13,149
That would be terrible.

1294
01:11:13,149 --> 01:11:14,189
Paint thinner.

1295
01:11:18,909 --> 01:11:21,180
No, not that either.

1296
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:24,380
It's like a little, like, hydration packet thing.

1297
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:27,119
Okay, here we go.

1298
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:28,750
Let's talk.

1299
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:32,939
Since the hoof-born are so entranced with the wider world,

1300
01:11:32,939 --> 01:11:35,260
you offer to tell them of your adventures.

1301
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:38,340
They surround you with eager faces as you speak of the gloomy,

1302
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:43,939
abandoned house of the blind noble Theta and the austere meeting hall of the council.

1303
01:11:43,939 --> 01:11:47,359
You tell them the story of your journey through the vast plains.

1304
01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:52,140
You tell them about Lake Eklala and your battle with the dreaded water serpent.

1305
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:56,539
They clearly do not believe half of what you say, but enjoy the adventure nonetheless.

1306
01:11:56,539 --> 01:11:59,869
They look wistfully across the mountains when you are finished.

1307
01:11:59,869 --> 01:12:03,979
The fire smolders gently.

1308
01:12:03,979 --> 01:12:05,180
Ask about the archmage.

1309
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:08,640
What can you tell me of the archmage?

1310
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,020
One of the goat people shrugs.

1311
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:12,060
Another laughs.

1312
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:17,100
Strange rumors come out of Manpang, stranger.

1313
01:12:17,659 --> 01:12:19,500
Strange rumors indeed.

1314
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:23,550
I can imagine.

1315
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:30,430
There are those merchants and traders, mostly, who say Manpang is run by the guards.

1316
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:35,739
They say the archmage does not appear.

1317
01:12:35,739 --> 01:12:38,659
Perhaps he is a recluse.

1318
01:12:38,659 --> 01:12:40,579
The goat person shrugs once more.

1319
01:12:40,579 --> 01:12:44,159
Merchants say he is dead.

1320
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:48,609
They say if he was alive he would be over a thousand years old.

1321
01:12:48,609 --> 01:12:50,260
But who can say?

1322
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:55,300
It is certainly true he never steps outside of Manpang.

1323
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:58,449
That is all they will say.

1324
01:12:58,449 --> 01:13:00,850
You get to your feet once more and look around the village.

1325
01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:03,779
There are some youths playing around in the dirt.

1326
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:05,939
They're hairier than their elders.

1327
01:13:05,939 --> 01:13:08,319
Some are using all four legs.

1328
01:13:08,319 --> 01:13:10,399
Do they grow into their humanity?

1329
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:25,760
Or are the younger ones simply more goat-like due to the archmage's interference?

1330
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:30,750
You approach Shihori, who is seated outside a largest hut, and nod a greeting.

1331
01:13:30,750 --> 01:13:31,550
Greetings.

1332
01:13:32,109 --> 01:13:37,569
I hope you are finding our village comfortable.

1333
01:13:37,569 --> 01:13:38,369
Thank you.

1334
01:13:38,369 --> 01:13:42,350
This will be your last respite, I think.

1335
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:48,130
Shihori looks away into the distance, and for the first time you notice that her eyes

1336
01:13:48,130 --> 01:13:50,529
are blurry and weak.

1337
01:13:50,529 --> 01:13:55,710
You are blind?

1338
01:13:55,710 --> 01:13:59,260
Not yet, but I lose sight with every passing year.

1339
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:02,500
We are all made.

1340
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:03,380
Creatures.

1341
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:07,229
But not made to last.

1342
01:14:07,229 --> 01:14:08,350
You've been to Manpang.

1343
01:14:11,329 --> 01:14:12,930
We used to live in Manpang.

1344
01:14:12,930 --> 01:14:14,819
Several of us.

1345
01:14:14,819 --> 01:14:17,149
At any rate, we escaped.

1346
01:14:17,149 --> 01:14:24,260
You were the archmage's prisoners?

1347
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:27,060
Of a sort.

1348
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:30,319
No, you were experiments?

1349
01:14:30,319 --> 01:14:32,449
Yes.

1350
01:14:32,449 --> 01:14:34,050
We.

1351
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:34,930
Yes, we.

1352
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:37,859
That is horrifying.

1353
01:14:37,859 --> 01:14:41,779
She stomps once, a sharp sound that echoes through the nearby caves.

1354
01:14:41,779 --> 01:14:44,800
We are not horrors, she says.

1355
01:14:45,359 --> 01:14:48,880
We are the product of cruelty, but that does not define us.

1356
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:56,579
Can you tell me of the birdmen?

1357
01:14:56,579 --> 01:14:58,899
What will your people do?

1358
01:14:58,899 --> 01:15:01,810
I'm told you cannot have children.

1359
01:15:01,810 --> 01:15:04,850
There's nothing we can do.

1360
01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:09,260
They must live as well as they can.

1361
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:10,140
That is all.

1362
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:14,020
You nod and turn to leave.

1363
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:17,260
One last thing before you step away.

1364
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:22,300
If you should find the archmage.

1365
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:23,840
Yes?

1366
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,840
Kill him without hesitation.

1367
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:36,899
With that she looks away, her weak eyes searching the distant horizons for answers.

1368
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:38,189
I will.

1369
01:15:38,189 --> 01:15:39,069
I will.

1370
01:15:39,069 --> 01:15:48,989
You head for the edge of the village, but Shihori clip-clops over to you.

1371
01:15:48,989 --> 01:15:54,020
She is armed now with a long and heavy spear which she levels at you.

1372
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:54,579
What?

1373
01:15:54,579 --> 01:15:57,310
Shihori?

1374
01:15:57,310 --> 01:16:03,649
Shihori holds your gaze for a moment, then flips the spear around to lie handle first.

1375
01:16:03,649 --> 01:16:07,090
It's a blessed spear.

1376
01:16:07,090 --> 01:16:08,689
Take it.

1377
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:09,810
As a thanks.

1378
01:16:09,810 --> 01:16:14,180
It may help you to penetrate the defenses that surround the archmage.

1379
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:18,270
This thing was 70 bucks?

1380
01:16:18,270 --> 01:16:22,399
I almost bought this, if I had the money.

1381
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:27,250
Go sell it for 70 gold.

1382
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:28,050
Thank you.

1383
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:29,539
I am honored.

1384
01:16:29,539 --> 01:16:32,029
You take the spear and strap it to your back.

1385
01:16:32,029 --> 01:16:36,369
It feels as promised most firmly made.

1386
01:16:36,369 --> 01:16:41,119
Now go, and may the gods of the old world be with you.

1387
01:16:41,119 --> 01:16:42,979
You turn to take your leave.

1388
01:16:42,979 --> 01:16:45,140
A guard accompanies you back to the main path.

1389
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:49,500
You're grateful for it, as the route is so steep you risk a fall without help.

1390
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:53,659
So how, let me see, what is this thing?

1391
01:16:53,659 --> 01:16:54,699
How good is it?

1392
01:16:54,699 --> 01:16:59,890
Blessed hardwood spear.

1393
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:05,520
Hardwood spear declared to be unbreakable by the hoofborne.

1394
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,380
I have a lot of weapons.

1395
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:12,699
Interesting.

1396
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:16,909
Now this is really funny.

1397
01:17:16,909 --> 01:17:30,590
Once at the road, your guide extends his arms in the hoofborne bow.

1398
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:35,760
Thank you for your news and stories, traveler.

1399
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:38,189
But we would appreciate if you did not return.

1400
01:17:38,909 --> 01:17:42,380
We cannot risk a spy from Mampang following you to discover our home.

1401
01:17:45,779 --> 01:17:50,340
I will destroy Mampang!

1402
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:56,319
He smiles, extends his arms again, and disappears up the narrow path.

1403
01:17:56,319 --> 01:18:02,779
Okay, back to the trail.

1404
01:18:02,779 --> 01:18:04,140
Am I gonna be okay going down here?

1405
01:18:06,909 --> 01:18:09,869
You skitter and scramble the last few lengths down to the trail once more.

1406
01:18:09,869 --> 01:18:14,479
The sun is beginning to lower and the air begins to cool.

1407
01:18:14,479 --> 01:18:15,920
Look for the hoofborne path.

1408
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:17,359
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1409
01:18:18,699 --> 01:18:21,500
You look back trying to find the path by which you climbed up into the peaks,

1410
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:26,270
but after a few false starts, you've managed to nothing but a few scrapes and falls.

1411
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:30,109
Perhaps you only ever had the confidence to climb such a slope

1412
01:18:30,109 --> 01:18:32,350
because the hoofborne were leading you.

1413
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:36,189
At any rate, the curious cave village now is vanished from reach.

1414
01:18:36,189 --> 01:18:39,520
The path runs in both directions along the chasm edge.

1415
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:42,109
All right, so what is this way?

1416
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:51,489
Go over here, and go over here.

1417
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:59,979
There's gonna be a few opportunities across the bridge, but what is this?

1418
01:18:59,979 --> 01:19:00,779
I want to know what that is.

1419
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:07,810
Bro, you're a wizard, just float.

1420
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:11,859
Well, we're gonna go this way anyway.

1421
01:19:11,859 --> 01:19:18,109
You walk along the edge of a sharp ledge which looks down to the deep chasm.

1422
01:19:18,109 --> 01:19:21,869
The gap is wide, but across it you can see a path winding through the mountains

1423
01:19:21,869 --> 01:19:23,069
towards Banpeng Fortress.

1424
01:19:23,710 --> 01:19:27,090
A rope hangs suspended in midair above the chasm.

1425
01:19:27,090 --> 01:19:30,289
Its near end is coiled up neatly on the path.

1426
01:19:30,289 --> 01:19:34,270
That's probably a trap.

1427
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:35,649
Let's find out.

1428
01:19:36,289 --> 01:19:48,479
Okay, there's one way to do it.

1429
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:55,119
Read minds of who.

1430
01:19:55,760 --> 01:20:00,399
I mean, we're gonna go for it.

1431
01:20:00,399 --> 01:20:01,119
One stamina.

1432
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:04,859
Weave the enchantment.

1433
01:20:04,859 --> 01:20:06,460
A quiet voice enters your mind.

1434
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:09,819
The voice informs you that the rope swing is a trap.

1435
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:12,140
But so are the bridges.

1436
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:13,100
And the path ahead.

1437
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:17,119
And then before it can offer anything more useful, the voice fades from your mind.

1438
01:20:17,119 --> 01:20:18,479
So everything sucks.

1439
01:20:18,479 --> 01:20:20,819
Okay, good.

1440
01:20:20,819 --> 01:20:22,579
Hey, be careful.

1441
01:20:22,579 --> 01:20:24,859
That rope swing is a trap.

1442
01:20:24,859 --> 01:20:26,220
So are all the bridges.

1443
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:27,659
So are all the paths.

1444
01:20:27,659 --> 01:20:29,420
So are all the foods.

1445
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:30,939
So is the air that you breathe.

1446
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:33,340
Everything is going to kill you.

1447
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:36,739
Good luck.

1448
01:20:36,739 --> 01:20:39,390
Everything is sus.

1449
01:20:39,390 --> 01:20:40,510
You are fucked.

1450
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:50,829
Um, I guess it doesn't really matter.

1451
01:20:50,829 --> 01:20:53,149
Looking to your right, you notice the trail continues.

1452
01:20:53,149 --> 01:20:54,989
You think you see a bridge in the distance.

1453
01:20:54,989 --> 01:20:57,470
What else can I do?

1454
01:21:07,489 --> 01:21:09,010
That's not a bad one either.

1455
01:21:09,010 --> 01:21:16,939
You cast the spell, expecting the calm voice of the enchantment to talk into your ear.

1456
01:21:17,579 --> 01:21:18,619
But it does not come.

1457
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:23,579
Instead, without any explanation, the rope's invisible anchor point seems to evaporate.

1458
01:21:23,579 --> 01:21:27,229
And the rope plunges away into the ravine and is gone.

1459
01:21:27,229 --> 01:21:28,510
Definitely a fixed spell.

1460
01:21:29,229 --> 01:21:30,270
Countered by how?

1461
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:35,229
Oh, okay.

1462
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:38,939
You lean over, looking down the chasm.

1463
01:21:38,939 --> 01:21:40,380
I knew it wasn't gonna be that easy.

1464
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:42,319
There is no sign of the rope.

1465
01:21:42,319 --> 01:21:45,760
At the bottom, you can make out a rocky path that winds out of view.

1466
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:51,039
It is all but hidden below a layer of fog.

1467
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:52,000
Uh, I'm gonna keep going.

1468
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:57,739
I'm gonna go all the way to the end here, if I can.

1469
01:21:57,739 --> 01:22:03,250
The rope was clearly a deathtrap.

1470
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:06,449
You leave it behind, walking towards the bridge in the distance.

1471
01:22:06,449 --> 01:22:10,130
For a moment, you seem to see something moving on the slopes above you.

1472
01:22:10,689 --> 01:22:12,529
Well, let's look.

1473
01:22:13,979 --> 01:22:15,579
You look up but can see nothing.

1474
01:22:15,579 --> 01:22:18,739
A hoofborn, perhaps, watching your progress.

1475
01:22:18,739 --> 01:22:19,220
Wave.

1476
01:22:20,350 --> 01:22:20,850
Hey!

1477
01:22:21,310 --> 01:22:24,180
A few moments later, a rock strikes you on the temple,

1478
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:36,369
though you do not see if it was thrown or if it simply fell.

1479
01:22:36,369 --> 01:22:36,930
Okay.

1480
01:22:36,930 --> 01:22:39,250
Apparently, it didn't hurt very much.

1481
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:42,159
Make a move.

1482
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,479
Who's throwing rocks at me?

1483
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:44,720
Why?

1484
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,199
It has to be somebody from here.

1485
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:49,840
What the fuck?

1486
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:54,770
You definitely have a dent in your temple now.

1487
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:55,090
Yeah.

1488
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:58,260
It's Gollum.

1489
01:23:01,739 --> 01:23:07,939
That's Shibirri the rock thrower.

1490
01:23:07,939 --> 01:23:08,579
Shibirri.

1491
01:23:08,579 --> 01:23:12,029
Shibirri is Elden Ring.

1492
01:23:12,029 --> 01:23:12,989
Shibirri.

1493
01:23:12,989 --> 01:23:17,949
Okay.

1494
01:23:17,949 --> 01:23:21,630
You head along the path until you reach the foot of the sturdy-looking bridge

1495
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:23,069
that spans the chasm here.

1496
01:23:23,069 --> 01:23:25,630
The sun begins to dip, heading towards the horizon.

1497
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:29,840
Sturdy-looking bridge that spans the chasm here.

1498
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:34,449
I am not going over that bridge.

1499
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:45,180
Uh, Bugleberry told me it was unsafe.

1500
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:46,779
Make chaos!

1501
01:23:46,779 --> 01:23:48,979
Take the world!

1502
01:23:48,979 --> 01:23:52,560
The wind picks up as the evening draws on.

1503
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,609
It will be dark soon.

1504
01:23:54,609 --> 01:23:56,130
Continuing around the side of the mountain,

1505
01:23:56,130 --> 01:24:00,609
your hopes are lifted as the path up ahead pinches and curves back in on itself.

1506
01:24:00,609 --> 01:24:04,880
The chasm itself has shrunk to a small gap.

1507
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,399
Oh, I can jump this.

1508
01:24:06,399 --> 01:24:09,329
Or should I?

1509
01:24:09,329 --> 01:24:14,140
Should I just keep going?

1510
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:16,140
Look across.

1511
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:20,479
Looking across the chasm, there is a rough path cleft into the far peak.

1512
01:24:20,479 --> 01:24:23,680
It curves away out of sight, roughly in the direction of Manpang.

1513
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:32,130
Does that say judge the gap or fudge the gap?

1514
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:34,770
Okay, it's judge.

1515
01:24:34,770 --> 01:24:37,649
The gap cannot be much wider than a stride and a half.

1516
01:24:37,649 --> 01:24:42,750
With a decent run-up, you should be able to make it.

1517
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:53,340
Uh, should I jump it or should I just keep going?

1518
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:54,380
Just fudge it?

1519
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:55,739
All right, I'm gonna fudge it.

1520
01:24:55,739 --> 01:25:01,069
You take a run-up, rush forward, and hurl yourself into open space.

1521
01:25:04,670 --> 01:25:08,960
The jump is short and you are confident until a moment before you land

1522
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:13,920
when two strong talons scream down out of the sky and skewer through your shoulders.

1523
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:16,659
Look up.

1524
01:25:18,689 --> 01:25:22,770
You twist your head up and find yourself staring at the feathered lower body of a birdman.

1525
01:25:23,329 --> 01:25:27,119
Then you are being dragged up into the air,

1526
01:25:27,119 --> 01:25:36,300
each wingbeat sending arcs of pain throughout your body.

1527
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:38,539
Okay, I think I remember this.

1528
01:25:38,539 --> 01:25:40,300
I remember this is possible.

1529
01:25:40,859 --> 01:25:45,550
The mountains become a furry gray.

1530
01:25:47,329 --> 01:25:48,529
I was gonna say fury.

1531
01:25:49,090 --> 01:25:51,729
The mountains become a furry gray as you rise.

1532
01:25:51,729 --> 01:25:55,010
The ravines are now nothing but deep black scars.

1533
01:25:55,010 --> 01:25:56,739
Cast a spell.

1534
01:25:56,739 --> 01:25:58,800
You try to spread your arms to cast a spell,

1535
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:03,600
but the talons have been skewered expertly to prevent your arms from lifting upwards.

1536
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:08,109
The creature wheels in the sky, growing with evil delight.

1537
01:26:08,109 --> 01:26:09,409
It is still rising.

1538
01:26:09,409 --> 01:26:13,229
Oh, shit.

1539
01:26:13,229 --> 01:26:20,100
The birdman screams out in a cruel and vibrant voice.

1540
01:26:20,659 --> 01:26:24,130
Threaten the creature.

1541
01:26:24,130 --> 01:26:25,890
You scream a threat at the bird.

1542
01:26:25,890 --> 01:26:28,050
Brutal, angry, disgusted.

1543
01:26:28,050 --> 01:26:33,380
Perhaps the creature takes offense, or perhaps it was always going to do the same thing.

1544
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:35,779
Either way, a moment later, the talons open.

1545
01:26:35,779 --> 01:26:39,600
The birdman banks above a peak as it releases you,

1546
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:50,430
and you tumble downwards through the air.

1547
01:26:50,430 --> 01:26:51,869
My health!

1548
01:26:51,869 --> 01:26:53,630
I just lost, like, all my health.

1549
01:26:53,630 --> 01:27:00,859
You land somewhere with a heavy thump that knocks all the wind from your frame.

1550
01:27:00,859 --> 01:27:04,380
You're on some kind of loose straw, which has cushioned you.

1551
01:27:05,569 --> 01:27:09,010
Overhead, the birdman wheels and circles away.

1552
01:27:09,010 --> 01:27:15,250
Presumably, it believes you cannot leave the ground.

1553
01:27:15,250 --> 01:27:19,060
It takes a moment to realize where you are.

1554
01:27:19,060 --> 01:27:20,659
This is a nest.

1555
01:27:20,659 --> 01:27:24,380
The nest is an intricate construction of twigs and branches

1556
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:26,619
built into a natural cleft in the peak.

1557
01:27:26,619 --> 01:27:29,420
The wind whips past a short distance away.

1558
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:32,829
Everything it can grasp has already been taken.

1559
01:27:32,829 --> 01:27:37,149
On one side is a dark hole in the straw that might be large enough for you to crawl through.

1560
01:27:42,270 --> 01:27:43,390
Strike a light?

1561
01:27:43,390 --> 01:27:49,439
Should I wait?

1562
01:27:50,079 --> 01:27:53,500
I don't want to burn my spellbook.

1563
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:57,890
I'm going to go inside.

1564
01:27:58,689 --> 01:28:02,750
You crawl through the hole into the heart of the nest.

1565
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:03,310
I'm going in.

1566
01:28:03,949 --> 01:28:11,069
The inside of the nest is a curious bell-shaped chamber open to the sky.

1567
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:16,270
The walls are of woven straw, matted with feathers and scraps of fur.

1568
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:19,439
Search the nest.

1569
01:28:20,079 --> 01:28:23,659
You poke around the nest, eventually coming across a black face mask

1570
01:28:23,659 --> 01:28:25,500
packed roughly into one of the walls.

1571
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:30,000
But as you weigh your find in your hands, you hear a shriek from behind you.

1572
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,130
Draw my sword.

1573
01:28:32,130 --> 01:28:32,630
Oh boy.

1574
01:28:34,579 --> 01:28:38,979
You draw your sword as talons rake down your back, leaving deep cuts.

1575
01:28:39,619 --> 01:28:42,020
You roll away, dodging another slash.

1576
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:46,819
Once on your feet, you come face to face with the nest's owner, who has returned.

1577
01:28:46,819 --> 01:28:51,779
The birdman's wings are outstretched, clawed hands already up and ready to tear at your body.

1578
01:28:51,779 --> 01:28:54,260
The vicious talons drip with your blood.

1579
01:28:56,079 --> 01:28:56,720
Full blast.

1580
01:28:57,279 --> 01:28:58,380
Probably a bad idea.

1581
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:00,420
Uhhhh.

1582
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:09,420
The birdman charges across the nest, spitting and cursing.

1583
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:12,939
You squat into a defensive crouch, blade raised.

1584
01:29:12,939 --> 01:29:15,279
The birdman rushes at you before slipping aside,

1585
01:29:15,279 --> 01:29:18,319
moments before he strikes, merely scraping at your defenses.

1586
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:20,319
You escape mostly unscathed.

1587
01:29:20,319 --> 01:29:25,470
The birdman opens his beak to cry, and his feet worry at the ground.

1588
01:29:25,470 --> 01:29:28,380
All right, well, definitely coming in hard now.

1589
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:29,819
Really?

1590
01:29:29,819 --> 01:29:30,319
That's it?

1591
01:29:33,039 --> 01:29:33,840
Shit.

1592
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,039
I'm so nervous.

1593
01:29:35,039 --> 01:29:36,079
He's got so much-

1594
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:38,430
You stay low.

1595
01:29:38,430 --> 01:29:42,430
The birdman tries to slice you with a lazy slash of his claws, but you duck.

1596
01:29:42,430 --> 01:29:45,859
The birdman issues a bloody call and spreads its wings.

1597
01:29:45,859 --> 01:29:47,220
All right, you don't have enough.

1598
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:47,720
Full blast.

1599
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:49,460
That's a huge blow.

1600
01:29:51,659 --> 01:29:53,180
That's a massive deal.

1601
01:29:53,899 --> 01:29:57,970
Okay.

1602
01:29:57,970 --> 01:30:04,050
Your blade sings as it parts the air, cutting straight through his own vicious, ragged attack.

1603
01:30:04,689 --> 01:30:06,539
You cut the birdman deep into his belly.

1604
01:30:06,539 --> 01:30:08,779
The creature howls at you in fury.

1605
01:30:08,779 --> 01:30:10,460
He clicks together long nails once more.

1606
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:13,039
He is still determined to fight.

1607
01:30:13,039 --> 01:30:13,840
Let's go again, then.

1608
01:30:14,479 --> 01:30:15,600
Oh, you're fucking done.

1609
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:22,500
Okay, the creature screams in a blood-curdling tongue.

1610
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,180
He stretches his cruel nails.

1611
01:30:27,539 --> 01:30:28,579
Do I still have more?

1612
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:30,659
I think I still might have more than-

1613
01:30:31,699 --> 01:30:32,199
Yep.

1614
01:30:33,789 --> 01:30:34,829
All right, nah, I gotta defend.

1615
01:30:35,710 --> 01:30:39,890
You cut a side blow.

1616
01:30:39,890 --> 01:30:41,489
The birdman wails as your blow connects.

1617
01:30:41,489 --> 01:30:42,930
He rises sharply backwards.

1618
01:30:42,930 --> 01:30:44,449
He stretches his long nails.

1619
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:46,050
Uh, I have to defend.

1620
01:30:46,050 --> 01:30:46,609
I don't have enough.

1621
01:30:47,489 --> 01:30:48,449
I may have-

1622
01:30:49,090 --> 01:30:50,130
That was like 1.8.

1623
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:55,119
Nice.

1624
01:30:55,119 --> 01:30:55,600
All right, got it.

1625
01:30:57,390 --> 01:30:58,430
Uh, I'm just going in again.

1626
01:30:59,149 --> 01:31:01,739
Just barely, but I got it.

1627
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:05,119
Another chance follows.

1628
01:31:05,119 --> 01:31:07,119
You jump through the air, hoping to catch the creature.

1629
01:31:07,119 --> 01:31:10,479
The birdman falls to the ground, feathers drifting from his body.

1630
01:31:10,479 --> 01:31:13,840
The savage light in his eyes has gone dark.

1631
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:19,699
While the birdmen may be delicately boned, they are vicious fighters.

1632
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:22,899
You stagger back against the straw, grasping for-

1633
01:31:22,899 --> 01:31:24,500
Yeah, your breath is gone.

1634
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:26,100
Look at you.

1635
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:29,140
All right, let's get that mask.

1636
01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:30,979
You look around the chamber with interest.

1637
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:32,640
It is all wrong.

1638
01:31:33,279 --> 01:31:38,289
It is as though the birdmen are not sure exactly how a proper nest should be made.

1639
01:31:38,289 --> 01:31:40,590
This place is a weird hybrid.

1640
01:31:40,590 --> 01:31:42,909
Part nest and part straw hut.

1641
01:31:42,909 --> 01:31:47,069
You crawl back out of the nest.

1642
01:31:47,069 --> 01:31:48,029
Did I get the mask?

1643
01:31:48,590 --> 01:31:57,100
I got it.

1644
01:31:57,100 --> 01:32:03,439
Okay, back outside.

1645
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:12,060
Uh, can I strike a light without my-

1646
01:32:12,779 --> 01:32:14,800
You bend down and spark a flame.

1647
01:32:15,359 --> 01:32:19,119
A moment later, the flame has jumped to the dry straw of the nest.

1648
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:21,359
The delicate twigs begin to glow and curl.

1649
01:32:22,369 --> 01:32:23,010
Oh, shit.

1650
01:32:26,739 --> 01:32:31,810
Hold on, let me read this again.

1651
01:32:31,810 --> 01:32:35,250
You emerge into the fresh air and biting wind on the edge of the cliff.

1652
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:37,329
Night has fallen and you are worn out.

1653
01:32:37,329 --> 01:32:39,649
You should find somewhere safe to sleep.

1654
01:32:39,649 --> 01:32:42,449
For if you keep going through the night, you will be weaker for it.

1655
01:32:42,449 --> 01:32:44,689
And then I just burnt the whole fucking place down.

1656
01:32:44,689 --> 01:32:46,289
I have to extinguish the flames.

1657
01:32:46,289 --> 01:32:49,810
You stamp out the flames, but they have spread too far and are too fast to put out.

1658
01:32:52,689 --> 01:32:57,649
You wait, cruelly admiring your handiwork as the nest roars into a pyre.

1659
01:32:57,970 --> 01:33:00,819
There's nothing else to do but risk the climb down to the path.

1660
01:33:00,819 --> 01:33:03,060
It cannot be more dangerous than staying here.

1661
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:04,899
This was a perfect place to sleep.

1662
01:33:04,899 --> 01:33:06,579
And to eat something.

1663
01:33:12,539 --> 01:33:12,779
Shit.

1664
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:17,060
You clamber slowly and carefully back down to the path.

1665
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:21,220
Smoke plumes from the nest above, trailing into the sky.

1666
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:25,220
You can only hope no one in Mampang is watching.

1667
01:33:25,220 --> 01:33:27,300
Uh, that's very bad.

1668
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:29,859
That is very bad.

1669
01:33:29,859 --> 01:33:37,180
I might have to rewind that.

1670
01:33:40,399 --> 01:33:42,989
Yep, I'm gonna use one of my three rewinds.

1671
01:33:46,939 --> 01:33:48,060
Because he's gonna see.

1672
01:33:48,779 --> 01:33:51,149
Okay, climb down.

1673
01:33:53,699 --> 01:33:54,579
Yeah, I'm cheating.

1674
01:33:54,579 --> 01:33:54,979
It's fine.

1675
01:33:55,779 --> 01:34:02,720
Okay, so here's the thing.

1676
01:34:03,979 --> 01:34:05,979
I could go up through here.

1677
01:34:06,619 --> 01:34:13,710
Or I could go down and I would have been crossed the bridge and over here.

1678
01:34:14,270 --> 01:34:16,590
I guess I could also go this way too.

1679
01:34:16,590 --> 01:34:17,789
No, I don't think so.

1680
01:34:21,260 --> 01:34:21,819
There's this.

1681
01:34:21,819 --> 01:34:22,539
There's also this.

1682
01:34:23,180 --> 01:34:31,020
I'm not sure.

1683
01:34:32,159 --> 01:34:34,000
But I know I'm gonna go at least up here.

1684
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:39,140
You head down a slight incline.

1685
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:41,619
Mampang looms into view once more.

1686
01:34:41,619 --> 01:34:45,840
It is as though these mountain passes had been carved to ensure no one approaching could

1687
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:48,159
forget the citadel's looming presence.

1688
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:51,619
Look ahead.

1689
01:34:52,930 --> 01:34:57,409
Looking at the path ahead, you see the ground appear to buckle where a sharp rock rim rises

1690
01:34:57,409 --> 01:34:58,130
out of the ground.

1691
01:34:58,850 --> 01:35:03,250
Before you lies a deep crater, as though an entire mountain peak had been scooped away.

1692
01:35:03,250 --> 01:35:04,529
You will have to find a way across.

1693
01:35:05,090 --> 01:35:09,149
The moon moves slowly across the dark sky.

1694
01:35:09,789 --> 01:35:18,340
You climb over the rim of the crater.

1695
01:35:18,340 --> 01:35:21,630
Then you skid and slide several feet down the rough slope.

1696
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:24,260
Finally landing on what appears to be a path.

1697
01:35:27,039 --> 01:35:27,920
Check myself over.

1698
01:35:28,479 --> 01:35:32,350
You are uninjured, but there is no way back up.

1699
01:35:32,350 --> 01:35:34,109
A path leads down into the crater here.

1700
01:35:34,109 --> 01:35:37,390
Another trail leads north to south, around the rim.

1701
01:35:37,390 --> 01:35:40,079
It's cold.

1702
01:35:40,079 --> 01:35:45,310
The path down into the crater is wider and more beaten down than you might have expected.

1703
01:35:45,869 --> 01:35:50,350
This is not the main road to Mampang, but this trail must still see some use.

1704
01:35:50,350 --> 01:35:52,930
You would do well to find somewhere to rest safely.

1705
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:01,060
Uh, okay.

1706
01:36:02,079 --> 01:36:04,399
This could be wildly different depending on which way we go.

1707
01:36:04,399 --> 01:36:06,159
Because this way is this little house.

1708
01:36:06,979 --> 01:36:08,500
This way is this house.

1709
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:11,140
And this way is whatever this kind of chasm is here.

1710
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:14,460
So, I'm going to let you guys choose for the first time.

1711
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:18,539
Uh, are we going left, up, or right?

1712
01:36:18,539 --> 01:36:23,869
If there's a mod that is available, are we going to go left, up, or right?

1713
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:43,699
I'm saying, I don't want to influence the poll.

1714
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:50,050
Yeah, this is left, up, right.

1715
01:36:50,050 --> 01:36:53,939
Your voice just cracked?

1716
01:36:54,939 --> 01:36:55,659
It's going to.

1717
01:36:56,300 --> 01:37:01,409
When you go like this, when you go like this for two hours,

1718
01:37:01,409 --> 01:37:02,689
you're going to get a voice crack or two.

1719
01:37:02,689 --> 01:37:03,409
That's just the way it is.

1720
01:37:03,970 --> 01:37:12,880
Somebody just pushed their glasses up and said,

1721
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:15,840
well, Jerma, that's not what happened.

1722
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:18,479
You've only done that kind of voice.

1723
01:37:18,479 --> 01:37:19,760
You've been speaking normally.

1724
01:37:20,399 --> 01:37:24,079
You've only done voices for about 26 minutes total.

1725
01:37:25,420 --> 01:37:33,699
So, you're an idiot.

1726
01:37:33,699 --> 01:37:34,739
Why is it Squidward?

1727
01:37:35,380 --> 01:37:39,600
All right, where are we going?

1728
01:37:44,210 --> 01:37:45,729
And it looks like...

1729
01:37:51,470 --> 01:37:51,970
Let's go!

1730
01:37:52,670 --> 01:38:03,579
Why are you mocking your audience?

1731
01:38:03,579 --> 01:38:06,460
I wasn't mocking the audience.

1732
01:38:06,460 --> 01:38:11,180
I was mocking one person in the audience that I made up

1733
01:38:11,180 --> 01:38:15,149
to prove a point that doesn't really even matter.

1734
01:38:15,710 --> 01:38:23,489
Okay, you follow the trail until it becomes lost under thick scrub.

1735
01:38:24,210 --> 01:38:25,890
In the dark, you can no longer see the path.

1736
01:38:26,529 --> 01:38:30,659
This is a really bad place to go to sleep, but I kind of have to.

1737
01:38:30,659 --> 01:38:38,479
You try to lie down and curl up to sleep, but you are too exposed.

1738
01:38:39,039 --> 01:38:42,720
Anything flying overhead would see you in moments once the sun rises.

1739
01:38:43,279 --> 01:38:45,680
Better to find a place to sleep in the scrub.

1740
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:47,470
You get back up to your feet.

1741
01:38:47,470 --> 01:38:56,350
Okay, well, I guess I'm going into the scrub.

1742
01:38:56,350 --> 01:38:58,909
You fight through the scrub that fills the crater basin.

1743
01:38:59,470 --> 01:39:01,470
In the darkness, you can see a little beyond your feet,

1744
01:39:02,029 --> 01:39:04,590
but there's plenty of cover you could sleep under.

1745
01:39:06,189 --> 01:39:08,850
Uh, yes, I need health.

1746
01:39:09,409 --> 01:39:10,289
Bad.

1747
01:39:11,789 --> 01:39:14,109
Setting down your pack, you try to stretch out despite the cold.

1748
01:39:14,109 --> 01:39:17,710
At least you've eaten already today, so you don't need to eat again to avoid hunger.

1749
01:39:17,710 --> 01:39:19,229
The more food will make you stronger.

1750
01:39:19,229 --> 01:39:20,189
I think I'm going to drink a potion.

1751
01:39:20,189 --> 01:39:21,310
This heals me more, right?

1752
01:39:22,130 --> 01:39:24,239
Yeah.

1753
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:27,760
Unstoppering a vial of blimberry potion, you gulp down a mouthful.

1754
01:39:28,399 --> 01:39:31,600
You feel a little better, and all traces of hunger are soon gone.

1755
01:39:32,529 --> 01:39:34,529
And you lie back and try to forget your troubles.

1756
01:39:39,489 --> 01:39:42,930
You wake in the night to see a black shadow slipping into the gloom beside you.

1757
01:39:43,489 --> 01:39:55,250
You open your arms to gather starlight, and a voice laughs quietly.

1758
01:39:55,250 --> 01:40:00,640
Two hands clasp yours and separate them.

1759
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:03,649
No need for that, Anor Londo.

1760
01:40:03,649 --> 01:40:06,050
The shape slips down onto the ground beside you.

1761
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:08,420
Make space for him.

1762
01:40:09,979 --> 01:40:13,569
You make a space for him close by your side.

1763
01:40:13,569 --> 01:40:16,449
It is a cold night, here in the shadow of evil.

1764
01:40:17,090 --> 01:40:18,470
Flanker!

1765
01:40:19,409 --> 01:40:19,909
Flanker?

1766
01:40:20,529 --> 01:40:24,819
I near the end of my journey has you near the end of yours.

1767
01:40:25,539 --> 01:40:28,899
But, Anor Londo, I fear the outcome.

1768
01:40:32,510 --> 01:40:34,539
What do you fear?

1769
01:40:34,539 --> 01:40:36,300
We have traveled a long road together.

1770
01:40:36,859 --> 01:40:38,060
Soon we must separate.

1771
01:40:41,329 --> 01:40:42,289
I am not afraid.

1772
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:44,590
I cannot know fear.

1773
01:40:45,149 --> 01:40:46,989
I am a dead man still alive.

1774
01:40:47,630 --> 01:40:50,750
An assassin is not permitted to experience mercy.

1775
01:40:50,750 --> 01:40:52,659
And yet, here I am.

1776
01:40:53,220 --> 01:40:59,840
Will you murder me in the dark?

1777
01:41:01,149 --> 01:41:02,909
I am glad of your company.

1778
01:41:02,909 --> 01:41:04,369
And I of yours.

1779
01:41:04,930 --> 01:41:10,380
The assassin is close enough to you for you to feel the movement as his powerful body relaxes.

1780
01:41:10,380 --> 01:41:12,560
Wait, what?

1781
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:15,569
Is like air coming out of him?

1782
01:41:16,579 --> 01:41:17,079
Like...

1783
01:41:17,939 --> 01:41:23,970
One of us will kill the Archmage.

1784
01:41:25,890 --> 01:41:26,449
Perhaps.

1785
01:41:27,170 --> 01:41:28,770
Certainly someone will die.

1786
01:41:29,489 --> 01:41:32,609
He touches your shoulder briefly.

1787
01:41:32,609 --> 01:41:33,649
Rest now.

1788
01:41:33,649 --> 01:41:38,960
And so the night passes.

1789
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:41,119
But you know that in the morning he will be gone.

1790
01:41:53,810 --> 01:41:55,010
You fucked up.

1791
01:42:00,260 --> 01:42:07,619
You fucked up.

1792
01:42:07,619 --> 01:42:08,420
You fucked up.

1793
01:42:09,060 --> 01:42:09,699
What do you mean?

1794
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:15,939
You didn't...

1795
01:42:16,899 --> 01:42:18,180
We wanted to kiss him.

1796
01:42:18,819 --> 01:42:19,949
I don't know if that's an option.

1797
01:42:22,270 --> 01:42:22,829
Rewind?

1798
01:42:30,289 --> 01:42:31,010
We don't...

1799
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:33,500
Rewind to Flanker.

1800
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:34,859
Rewind to Flanker.

1801
01:42:34,859 --> 01:42:35,260
Franker?

1802
01:42:37,260 --> 01:42:37,899
Franker.

1803
01:42:38,539 --> 01:42:39,500
Oh yeah, don't worry.

1804
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:41,500
Me and Franker, we'll see.

1805
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:43,420
That's not the last time you're gonna see Flanker.

1806
01:42:43,420 --> 01:42:44,060
Rewind?

1807
01:42:44,060 --> 01:42:44,560
Wait.

1808
01:42:44,939 --> 01:42:45,899
Hold on.

1809
01:42:45,899 --> 01:42:47,340
Are you actually telling me to do this?

1810
01:42:47,340 --> 01:42:48,140
This is how it works?

1811
01:42:48,699 --> 01:42:49,340
I'm curious.

1812
01:42:49,899 --> 01:42:57,359
Okay.

1813
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:07,350
Is there actually a romance option?

1814
01:43:07,350 --> 01:43:11,220
Okay.

1815
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:16,550
Flanker, what do you fear?

1816
01:43:18,020 --> 01:43:19,640
I am not afraid.

1817
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:20,359
Okay.

1818
01:43:20,359 --> 01:43:22,340
I'm glad for your company.

1819
01:43:22,340 --> 01:43:24,529
Can I ask you something?

1820
01:43:24,529 --> 01:43:25,250
Anything.

1821
01:43:25,250 --> 01:43:30,520
Will we survive this, do you think?

1822
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:32,359
Is there someone waiting for you back home?

1823
01:43:34,310 --> 01:43:35,189
No one.

1824
01:43:35,189 --> 01:43:37,510
I am a ghost walking, after all.

1825
01:43:37,510 --> 01:43:43,399
After this, I may go where I wish.

1826
01:43:43,399 --> 01:43:51,300
Wherever you are invited, who would make a dark ghost welcome?

1827
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:54,979
But as Flanker speaks, he breathes softly into the dark, very much alive.

1828
01:43:55,539 --> 01:43:56,899
Isaac got full health.

1829
01:43:56,899 --> 01:44:03,640
And so the night passes, but you know that in the morning he will be gone.

1830
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:08,529
Isaac, I have 20 HP now.

1831
01:44:08,529 --> 01:44:09,329
Holy shit.

1832
01:44:12,979 --> 01:44:15,539
The sex option full-healed me.

1833
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:19,880
But we don't know what that—that's what happened.

1834
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:21,239
We may have just—who knows?

1835
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:33,319
Sex full-heal.

1836
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:42,199
I just want to hear, like, a Super Mario mushroom sound right now.

1837
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:47,359
Okay.

1838
01:44:47,359 --> 01:44:48,479
Well, that's pretty awesome.

1839
01:44:48,479 --> 01:44:49,520
I have 20 fucking health.

1840
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:50,159
I had four.

1841
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:57,670
It is half-light when Flanker slips away.

1842
01:44:57,670 --> 01:45:00,949
You pick yourself to your feet and look around in the daylight.

1843
01:45:00,949 --> 01:45:05,359
A short distance ahead, you spy a large black bundle hanging from a tree.

1844
01:45:05,359 --> 01:45:07,539
Go look at it.

1845
01:45:07,539 --> 01:45:11,829
The bundle is long, at least six feet tall and jet black.

1846
01:45:11,829 --> 01:45:14,310
It sways slightly as it dangles from the branch.

1847
01:45:14,310 --> 01:45:17,270
As you get closer, you notice a chain running from the bundle to a stake in the ground.

1848
01:45:17,270 --> 01:45:19,430
You also notice the bundle is somewhat hairy.

1849
01:45:19,430 --> 01:45:43,380
Insulting the constellations above, you bind the spell, and a steady voice begins to speak to you.

1850
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:47,060
The bat has a loud wail.

1851
01:45:47,989 --> 01:45:49,989
Loud enough to be heard in the Citadel.

1852
01:45:51,140 --> 01:45:52,020
Be careful!

1853
01:45:53,939 --> 01:45:58,390
Okay, I'm not fucking with that.

1854
01:45:58,390 --> 01:46:02,390
The chained bat has not yet stirred.

1855
01:46:02,390 --> 01:46:04,630
Perhaps you can slip past unnoticed.

1856
01:46:05,810 --> 01:46:06,310
Yeah.

1857
01:46:07,590 --> 01:46:10,310
Tightening your pack, you begin to creep past the creature.

1858
01:46:10,949 --> 01:46:13,649
It sleeps soundly as you pass the tree.

1859
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:16,640
Near a tree.

1860
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:22,319
But then the creature snorts,

1861
01:46:23,359 --> 01:46:26,560
distracting you for just a moment, and you step on a branch with a crack.

1862
01:46:29,029 --> 01:46:33,760
Wait, is this the part of the movie or TV show where we get to step on like five things,

1863
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:35,840
and we get to hear over the course of a few minutes?

1864
01:46:40,399 --> 01:46:42,479
Or is he just going to get right up immediately?

1865
01:46:42,479 --> 01:46:48,020
Freeze.

1866
01:46:48,020 --> 01:46:53,300
You stop frozen to the spot, hand at the hilt of your assassin's sword.

1867
01:46:53,300 --> 01:47:00,279
The bat's head swivels this way and that, and then its beady eyes come to rest on yours.

1868
01:47:01,970 --> 01:47:03,090
Charge!

1869
01:47:03,090 --> 01:47:03,590
Cast spell.

1870
01:47:11,699 --> 01:47:12,500
I'm throwing a grenade.

1871
01:47:13,220 --> 01:47:17,439
You wind the stars into order around you.

1872
01:47:17,439 --> 01:47:22,479
Over the last of your pebbles, the superheated pebble lands right on the bat's nose.

1873
01:47:22,479 --> 01:47:25,039
It shrieks in pain, distracted and hurt.

1874
01:47:28,550 --> 01:47:29,989
Why did I not blow it up?

1875
01:47:29,989 --> 01:47:36,020
It didn't blow up.

1876
01:47:36,020 --> 01:47:36,819
Why was it a dud?

1877
01:47:40,050 --> 01:47:41,569
It's just really hot.

1878
01:47:42,210 --> 01:47:49,670
Why did it not explode?

1879
01:47:49,670 --> 01:47:51,029
Hold on a second.

1880
01:47:51,029 --> 01:47:52,550
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

1881
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:53,750
No, no, no, no, no.

1882
01:47:53,750 --> 01:47:54,710
I'm sorry.

1883
01:47:54,710 --> 01:47:55,270
I'm sorry.

1884
01:47:55,270 --> 01:47:56,470
I'll keep the same thing going.

1885
01:47:57,189 --> 01:47:59,350
But I thought I was gonna blow up.

1886
01:47:59,909 --> 01:48:04,039
Well, that didn't work.

1887
01:48:04,039 --> 01:48:04,359
Okay.

1888
01:48:05,159 --> 01:48:09,039
Summon replica creature.

1889
01:48:09,039 --> 01:48:09,279
No.

1890
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:16,550
There is a zip, which is teleport.

1891
01:48:19,119 --> 01:48:22,310
There is zen, which is hover.

1892
01:48:26,680 --> 01:48:28,039
There's also, yeah, this is zap.

1893
01:48:29,319 --> 01:48:30,359
Let me teleport.

1894
01:48:30,359 --> 01:48:31,880
I've never used a spell before, ever.

1895
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:33,880
I'm gonna teleport.

1896
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:40,119
You wind the stars into order around you, trusting to luck as the ring of green metal

1897
01:48:40,119 --> 01:48:42,840
on your finger begins to gleam like a serpent's eye.

1898
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:45,319
You close your eyes as your body is wrenched away.

1899
01:48:46,239 --> 01:48:48,319
You reappear a fair distance away.

1900
01:48:48,319 --> 01:48:52,050
The bat flies at you, but it's halted by the chain.

1901
01:48:52,050 --> 01:48:56,069
Frustrated, it tugs at its bindings, which hold fast.

1902
01:48:56,069 --> 01:48:59,670
But now that it is unable to attack you, it remembers its mission.

1903
01:49:00,229 --> 01:49:04,449
It turns to call reinforcements, and you are too far to stop it.

1904
01:49:04,449 --> 01:49:07,989
Shit.

1905
01:49:07,989 --> 01:49:08,789
Shit, shit, shit.

1906
01:49:08,789 --> 01:49:09,350
One more.

1907
01:49:09,350 --> 01:49:10,069
I'm, one more.

1908
01:49:10,710 --> 01:49:11,750
Last one.

1909
01:49:13,699 --> 01:49:14,420
Okay.

1910
01:49:14,420 --> 01:49:15,539
Try to creep past.

1911
01:49:16,100 --> 01:49:23,270
You keep going, brazenly picking your way amongst the rocks, watching for more branches.

1912
01:49:23,270 --> 01:49:25,189
But it is too late, and the damage is done.

1913
01:49:25,189 --> 01:49:30,760
The beat of leathery wings comes from behind, and then two claws slice at your back.

1914
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:32,920
You tumble to the ground, coughing with pain.

1915
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:38,279
The bat lifts out of reach as though about to fly above the tree.

1916
01:49:38,279 --> 01:49:39,649
Stop it.

1917
01:49:39,649 --> 01:49:44,369
You stare at the chain, realizing suddenly that the bat isn't a captive or a guard.

1918
01:49:44,930 --> 01:49:49,090
It is a lookout, placed to warn the fortress of intruders in the crater.

1919
01:49:49,090 --> 01:49:54,770
Its high-pitched wail will be heard by the sensitive ears of the birdmen even miles away.

1920
01:49:54,770 --> 01:49:59,479
You have to stop it before it can call a horde down on you.

1921
01:49:59,479 --> 01:50:00,840
Yank the chain.

1922
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:02,449
Throw the chakram.

1923
01:50:02,449 --> 01:50:04,689
Wait, what are the, any spells I can do now?

1924
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:08,789
That I couldn't do before?

1925
01:50:18,310 --> 01:50:20,960
Okay.

1926
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:21,460
Zap?

1927
01:50:22,369 --> 01:50:24,930
Zap might not kill it.

1928
01:50:25,649 --> 01:50:26,149
I'll try it.

1929
01:50:33,909 --> 01:50:34,710
Zap.

1930
01:50:34,710 --> 01:50:40,579
You wind the stars into order around you, building up a charge of electrical energy

1931
01:50:40,579 --> 01:50:41,380
around your palm.

1932
01:50:42,020 --> 01:50:44,180
Then you unleash it into the bat's body.

1933
01:50:44,739 --> 01:50:50,119
The creature jerks and smokes with energy before falling to the earth, a mere dark husk.

1934
01:50:50,119 --> 01:50:52,260
The trail runs in both directions.

1935
01:50:52,260 --> 01:50:53,060
I killed it!

1936
01:50:53,060 --> 01:50:57,699
Oh, it's connected to a chain.

1937
01:50:57,699 --> 01:51:00,500
Wouldn't that amplify the damage, probably?

1938
01:51:00,500 --> 01:51:01,140
That makes sense.

1939
01:51:02,340 --> 01:51:06,579
Metal?

1940
01:51:06,579 --> 01:51:07,380
All right.

1941
01:51:07,380 --> 01:51:08,880
Cool, good.

1942
01:51:12,079 --> 01:51:14,239
It is almost time for us to talk about a couple things.

1943
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:16,710
I have a few things to talk about.

1944
01:51:16,710 --> 01:51:20,390
We've got, first of all, we've got grotto beasts to go over.

1945
01:51:21,750 --> 01:51:23,109
We also have the BLT to eat.

1946
01:51:24,449 --> 01:51:30,000
And there's also a piece of merch that's going to drop soon.

1947
01:51:31,039 --> 01:51:33,520
Unrelated to grotto beasts, this is a completely different thing.

1948
01:51:34,609 --> 01:51:35,489
And we can talk about it.

1949
01:51:36,130 --> 01:51:37,329
Some of you may already have seen it.

1950
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:43,359
Oh my god, it's happening!

1951
01:51:43,359 --> 01:51:44,479
Don't, don't, hold on.

1952
01:51:50,210 --> 01:51:51,890
Is it your face mask?

1953
01:51:52,850 --> 01:51:53,350
No.

1954
01:51:54,369 --> 01:51:55,010
No, it is not.

1955
01:52:01,859 --> 01:52:05,060
Yeah, I got to sell that fucking mask of my face.

1956
01:52:06,020 --> 01:52:07,460
Incredibly detailed expan...

1957
01:52:07,460 --> 01:52:07,960
That's...

1958
01:52:08,739 --> 01:52:09,239
No.

1959
01:52:11,670 --> 01:52:14,470
But let's talk about a couple things.

1960
01:52:14,470 --> 01:52:16,390
Do you know what today is?

1961
01:52:16,390 --> 01:52:17,430
Does anybody know what today is?

1962
01:52:18,579 --> 01:52:19,779
We'll just do this in order.

1963
01:52:19,779 --> 01:52:20,739
Do you guys know what today is?

1964
01:52:21,829 --> 01:52:22,550
August what?

1965
01:52:22,550 --> 01:52:23,829
August 20...

1966
01:52:23,829 --> 01:52:24,550
What?

1967
01:52:24,550 --> 01:52:26,289
August 21st.

1968
01:52:28,319 --> 01:52:31,119
What is this, what is this the two-year anniversary of?

1969
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:33,640
As of literally right now.

1970
01:52:35,989 --> 01:52:37,350
It's Sturr's birthday, obviously.

1971
01:52:37,350 --> 01:52:38,229
Happy birthday, Sturr.

1972
01:52:38,229 --> 01:52:39,590
But something else, something to do with me.

1973
01:52:40,310 --> 01:52:44,789
It is the exact two-year anniversary of the Dollhouse.

1974
01:52:44,789 --> 01:52:45,510
And baseball.

1975
01:52:46,850 --> 01:52:52,130
So, U2's is coming out with two vinyl figures.

1976
01:52:53,010 --> 01:52:55,090
One is a Dollhouse Jerma.

1977
01:52:55,090 --> 01:52:57,649
And one is a Umpire Elbertson Jerma.

1978
01:53:01,359 --> 01:53:03,680
So, to talk about this for a second.

1979
01:53:04,399 --> 01:53:09,039
There's a lot of people that came to the channel over the last couple of years.

1980
01:53:10,100 --> 01:53:13,670
That saw like clips of Dollhouse.

1981
01:53:13,670 --> 01:53:16,069
The channel grew a lot since Dollhouse.

1982
01:53:17,380 --> 01:53:22,210
And I've seen over the years, the last couple of years.

1983
01:53:23,090 --> 01:53:25,569
Like we had the Dollhouse shirts.

1984
01:53:25,569 --> 01:53:28,050
We had the posters for the Dollhouse.

1985
01:53:28,689 --> 01:53:33,409
But I feel like a lot of people have approached this channel because of Dollhouse.

1986
01:53:34,949 --> 01:53:40,020
So, if you've got a Reddit shelf at your house, maybe you'd want these two.

1987
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:42,760
I can show them.

1988
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:43,720
I'm going to show them.

1989
01:53:44,359 --> 01:53:48,840
You can take a look.

1990
01:53:51,060 --> 01:53:53,220
You can get it on your Reddit shelf.

1991
01:53:53,779 --> 01:53:57,220
Heh, heh, heh.

1992
01:53:57,220 --> 01:53:58,659
That's what brought me in.

1993
01:53:58,659 --> 01:53:59,159
Yeah.

1994
01:54:00,289 --> 01:54:02,369
So, I figured, okay.

1995
01:54:02,369 --> 01:54:03,489
That like makes sense to me.

1996
01:54:04,210 --> 01:54:07,359
Give people an opportunity to get it if they want.

1997
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,689
Is it wearable?

1998
01:54:10,689 --> 01:54:11,810
It is a figurine.

1999
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:13,880
They're vinyl figurines.

2000
01:54:15,859 --> 01:54:16,579
They're toys.

2001
01:54:18,369 --> 01:54:21,090
Jerma has gotten into toys.

2002
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:30,239
All right, let me go back.

2003
01:54:31,329 --> 01:54:32,850
Um, let me get my...

2004
01:54:33,729 --> 01:54:34,850
Let me go pee.

2005
01:54:34,850 --> 01:54:35,729
Let me take a B or B.

2006
01:54:35,729 --> 01:54:37,409
Because I have Grotto B stuff to talk about.

2007
01:54:37,409 --> 01:54:38,930
And I have to get the fucking BLT up here.

2008
01:54:44,239 --> 01:54:45,359
They're action figures!

2009
01:54:45,359 --> 01:54:47,220
Heh, heh, heh.

2010
01:54:47,220 --> 01:54:47,699
Show them.

2011
01:54:47,699 --> 01:54:49,220
I'm, I'm, I'm telling you.

2012
01:54:49,220 --> 01:54:50,100
I gotta give you the plan.

2013
01:54:50,739 --> 01:54:54,000
Should I eat the BLT while I do this?

2014
01:55:05,829 --> 01:55:07,829
Where is the Catboy figurine?

2015
01:55:08,630 --> 01:55:10,550
That, that, that's not getting sold.

2016
01:55:11,939 --> 01:55:12,819
All right, be right back.

2017
01:55:12,819 --> 01:55:13,539
We'll talk about it.

2018
01:55:14,100 --> 01:55:15,939
Then we'll talk about Grotto Beasts.

2019
01:55:15,939 --> 01:55:18,210
A lot of stuff to go over.

2020
01:55:18,210 --> 01:55:19,250
I'll be right back.

2021
01:55:19,250 --> 01:57:02,880
Do this thing.

2022
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:04,319
Did I miss the BLT?

2023
01:57:04,319 --> 01:57:05,119
No, you didn't.

2024
01:57:05,119 --> 01:57:09,649
I got it right here.

2025
01:57:09,649 --> 01:57:15,300
Ho, ho, ho, ho, this thing looks good!

2026
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:16,579
It's just a regular BLT.

2027
01:57:16,579 --> 01:57:17,060
This, okay.

2028
01:57:19,539 --> 01:57:21,220
People, I don't know what you're expecting.

2029
01:57:21,220 --> 01:57:24,199
Do you have to eat it on face cam?

2030
01:57:24,199 --> 01:57:25,800
I am gonna eat this on face cam.

2031
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:28,789
But I'm not gonna eat it fucking weirdly.

2032
01:57:28,789 --> 01:57:31,479
Okay?

2033
01:57:31,479 --> 01:57:33,640
I'm gonna just take normal bites.

2034
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:35,159
I'm not gonna eat this weirdly.

2035
01:57:35,159 --> 01:57:38,149
I'm gonna, I'm not gonna,

2036
01:57:38,149 --> 01:57:39,829
I'm gonna eat it in like a side profile.

2037
01:57:39,829 --> 01:57:41,670
I'm not gonna look at the camera either.

2038
01:57:41,670 --> 01:57:42,550
You understand?

2039
01:57:42,550 --> 01:57:47,409
All right, I'm gonna give you the review.

2040
01:57:47,409 --> 01:57:53,829
But first I have to be...

2041
01:57:54,550 --> 01:57:55,829
I'm gonna jump scare you, by the way.

2042
01:57:55,829 --> 01:57:56,789
I'm about to be on camera.

2043
01:58:01,239 --> 01:58:01,960
You ready?

2044
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:07,000
That's, that scared me and I knew it was happening.

2045
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:08,470
Okay.

2046
01:58:08,470 --> 01:58:10,130
So, here we go.

2047
01:58:10,130 --> 01:58:11,489
I'm so grainy.

2048
01:58:12,050 --> 01:58:13,199
Here you go.

2049
01:58:13,199 --> 01:58:15,520
You ready?

2050
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:15,760
All right.

2051
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:16,800
So let's, hold on.

2052
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:17,359
How do you feel?

2053
01:58:17,359 --> 01:58:20,439
Ready?

2054
01:58:20,439 --> 01:58:22,279
Umpire Albertson.

2055
01:58:22,279 --> 01:58:26,609
Pretty cool.

2056
01:58:26,609 --> 01:58:29,720
And BLT, let's go!

2057
01:58:34,930 --> 01:58:35,729
Yeah!

2058
01:58:35,729 --> 01:58:45,359
That's good.

2059
01:58:45,359 --> 01:58:49,140
Hold on, hold on.

2060
01:58:49,140 --> 01:58:53,489
What about Dollhouse Jerma?

2061
01:58:53,489 --> 01:58:53,970
Hmm?

2062
01:58:53,970 --> 01:58:55,279
What do you think of that?

2063
01:58:55,279 --> 01:58:59,859
Take a look at this.

2064
01:58:59,859 --> 01:59:00,979
This shit's real.

2065
01:59:00,979 --> 01:59:02,659
This is a real fucking toy.

2066
01:59:02,659 --> 01:59:06,710
Let me open it.

2067
01:59:06,710 --> 01:59:07,350
Is it crispy?

2068
01:59:08,149 --> 01:59:14,520
Sorry about the wicked grainy footage.

2069
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:17,600
BLTs are so good.

2070
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:18,720
Just hits every note.

2071
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:22,239
All right, hold on.

2072
01:59:22,239 --> 01:59:23,039
Here we go.

2073
01:59:23,039 --> 01:59:24,319
You guys ready for the reveal?

2074
01:59:24,319 --> 01:59:30,289
Let me get it out.

2075
01:59:30,289 --> 01:59:33,479
There's stuff on the, on the package too.

2076
01:59:33,479 --> 01:59:35,939
Can I see?

2077
01:59:35,939 --> 01:59:36,420
Yep.

2078
01:59:36,420 --> 01:59:40,020
I was gonna say, warning.

2079
01:59:40,020 --> 01:59:44,050
This is an adult collectible.

2080
01:59:44,689 --> 01:59:45,729
Not a toy.

2081
01:59:45,729 --> 01:59:53,859
I just may have called it a toy a lot.

2082
01:59:53,859 --> 01:59:58,149
Let me take this out.

2083
01:59:58,149 --> 02:00:07,159
So there, there's an image of me from Dollhouse.

2084
02:00:07,159 --> 02:00:09,510
Which is the two-year anniversary of Dollhouse.

2085
02:00:09,510 --> 02:00:11,810
I don't want to be loud.

2086
02:00:11,810 --> 02:00:19,439
Let me get it out of the package.

2087
02:00:19,439 --> 02:00:24,420
There's a picture of me leaning against a door.

2088
02:00:24,420 --> 02:00:29,720
And that is the image that the people at U2s used for this.

2089
02:00:30,279 --> 02:00:33,399
See, it's like that.

2090
02:00:34,420 --> 02:00:35,140
Let me get you a good view.

2091
02:00:39,159 --> 02:00:40,680
It comes with the door.

2092
02:00:40,680 --> 02:00:43,670
And it does come with the door.

2093
02:00:43,670 --> 02:00:45,729
There's that one.

2094
02:00:45,729 --> 02:00:46,770
You can sit.

2095
02:00:47,409 --> 02:00:49,729
It could be like a little, maybe like a little bookshelf.

2096
02:00:49,729 --> 02:00:50,449
Your Reddit shelf.

2097
02:00:51,010 --> 02:00:53,399
Bookcase.

2098
02:00:53,399 --> 02:00:56,260
You know, pretty neat.

2099
02:00:56,260 --> 02:00:59,729
Let's do the umpire.

2100
02:00:59,729 --> 02:01:04,229
So I got this one here.

2101
02:01:04,229 --> 02:01:05,430
Wait, what's on the back?

2102
02:01:05,430 --> 02:01:12,470
Say this.

2103
02:01:12,470 --> 02:01:13,829
Can you detach the door?

2104
02:01:13,829 --> 02:01:14,869
That's a good question.

2105
02:01:14,869 --> 02:01:15,750
I don't know.

2106
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:18,640
I don't believe so.

2107
02:01:18,640 --> 02:01:20,960
I mean, you probably could.

2108
02:01:22,239 --> 02:01:25,760
If you really, if you really wanted to.

2109
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:26,079
I don't know.

2110
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:28,720
That might not be covered under warranty.

2111
02:01:28,720 --> 02:01:30,000
Let's just put it that way.

2112
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:30,880
Like there even is one.

2113
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:31,279
I don't know.

2114
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:34,239
But I don't think that that would, that would probably break it.

2115
02:01:38,600 --> 02:01:39,319
Warranty.

2116
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:44,079
It's not a fucking laptop.

2117
02:01:44,079 --> 02:01:45,760
Like, what am I talking about?

2118
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:52,050
I just don't want to be loud.

2119
02:01:52,050 --> 02:01:59,250
So this is from the umpire, which also was August 18th.

2120
02:01:59,250 --> 02:02:01,970
So this is kind of doubling them up a little here.

2121
02:02:02,609 --> 02:02:04,289
My God, I almost broke it.

2122
02:02:05,090 --> 02:02:05,649
Here's this one.

2123
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,359
You got the square there.

2124
02:02:09,920 --> 02:02:10,800
Accurate mustache.

2125
02:02:11,439 --> 02:02:12,899
Got this thing here too.

2126
02:02:13,699 --> 02:02:15,140
They stand on their own.

2127
02:02:15,859 --> 02:02:16,819
So they do stand up.

2128
02:02:19,750 --> 02:02:20,470
There I am.

2129
02:02:20,470 --> 02:02:22,789
Very, I'm very upset about that last call.

2130
02:02:23,510 --> 02:02:26,420
Oh yeah.

2131
02:02:28,869 --> 02:02:29,369
You twos.

2132
02:02:30,399 --> 02:02:32,239
These are not available right now.

2133
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:37,840
These are available on the 28th of August.

2134
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:38,560
So next week.

2135
02:02:39,279 --> 02:02:42,479
Look at that fucking mustache.

2136
02:02:42,479 --> 02:02:43,920
Look at how good that looks.

2137
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:47,119
That accurate mustache that didn't have to get filled in

2138
02:02:47,119 --> 02:02:48,479
by a professional makeup artist.

2139
02:02:49,199 --> 02:02:52,439
The box has some cool art stuff on it too.

2140
02:02:53,159 --> 02:02:53,720
Like in here.

2141
02:02:56,739 --> 02:02:57,140
Inside.

2142
02:02:57,140 --> 02:02:58,100
I don't know if you can see inside.

2143
02:02:58,739 --> 02:02:59,920
I don't want to break the box.

2144
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:00,640
This is the only one I have.

2145
02:03:00,640 --> 02:03:01,439
This is the only one I have.

2146
02:03:02,159 --> 02:03:02,899
Here and there.

2147
02:03:02,899 --> 02:03:04,819
You can see the logo.

2148
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:11,909
And you saw the back of it before.

2149
02:03:11,909 --> 02:03:12,949
What's on the inside of the other one?

2150
02:03:13,590 --> 02:03:20,869
Who's that?

2151
02:03:20,869 --> 02:03:22,760
There he is.

2152
02:03:23,399 --> 02:03:29,409
But if you want to get them, they are available on the 28th.

2153
02:03:29,409 --> 02:03:37,779
They will go on sale on I believe 12 p.m pacific is when it's going to be available.

2154
02:03:42,640 --> 02:03:46,449
Oh, no way.

2155
02:03:46,449 --> 02:03:46,850
No way.

2156
02:03:46,850 --> 02:03:47,409
You know what I mean?

2157
02:03:47,409 --> 02:03:48,529
Like no fucking way.

2158
02:03:48,529 --> 02:03:49,250
Is that going to happen?

2159
02:03:59,039 --> 02:04:00,319
It's a sandwich.

2160
02:04:00,319 --> 02:04:01,279
It's a sandwich.

2161
02:04:01,279 --> 02:04:02,000
Everybody chill.

2162
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:08,399
This is really good.

2163
02:04:08,399 --> 02:04:09,750
You want to get a good look at this?

2164
02:04:09,750 --> 02:04:11,029
Okay, so this is a BLT.

2165
02:04:11,829 --> 02:04:13,909
Let me open up the box of the BLT came in.

2166
02:04:13,909 --> 02:04:14,550
Okay, here we go.

2167
02:04:15,270 --> 02:04:17,319
As you see here.

2168
02:04:18,039 --> 02:04:19,989
So yeah, get a look at that.

2169
02:04:20,550 --> 02:04:22,949
Pretty good.

2170
02:04:23,489 --> 02:04:27,960
Pretty good tomato ratio there.

2171
02:04:32,050 --> 02:04:35,010
These are available in your house.

2172
02:04:35,649 --> 02:04:36,609
You just make it.

2173
02:04:38,689 --> 02:04:39,890
That was way too 3d.

2174
02:04:40,449 --> 02:04:47,670
I eat like a fucking weirdo.

2175
02:04:48,229 --> 02:04:50,149
When I know people, this is why I don't eat on screen.

2176
02:04:55,140 --> 02:04:56,579
When people are watching me eat.

2177
02:04:57,140 --> 02:04:58,819
I know that a lot of you can agree with this.

2178
02:04:59,380 --> 02:05:00,920
When anytime somebody watches me eat.

2179
02:05:01,560 --> 02:05:07,319
I immediately start thinking of every single chew, every single bite, every single what's

2180
02:05:07,319 --> 02:05:09,159
always something on my face, something on my nose.

2181
02:05:09,960 --> 02:05:15,329
I just want to be like in my own private room when I eat.

2182
02:05:15,970 --> 02:05:18,920
Let's get it.

2183
02:05:18,920 --> 02:05:20,119
Let's get a taste of that tomato.

2184
02:05:26,130 --> 02:05:27,170
Actually, I'm glad I'm eating this.

2185
02:05:27,729 --> 02:05:30,529
But yeah, um, those are the you chooses.

2186
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:37,159
It's uh, I believe I don't want to get the price wrong, but I think they're 29.

2187
02:05:37,159 --> 02:05:37,659
99.

2188
02:05:38,359 --> 02:05:41,159
Go to him over time.

2189
02:05:41,159 --> 02:05:41,479
Look at him.

2190
02:05:41,479 --> 02:05:42,279
I'm going to get them together.

2191
02:05:42,920 --> 02:05:46,020
Here you go.

2192
02:05:46,479 --> 02:05:48,439
There they are.

2193
02:05:48,439 --> 02:05:49,619
One and two.

2194
02:05:50,180 --> 02:05:52,840
Hey, what's that?

2195
02:05:52,840 --> 02:05:54,119
Hey, you're out.

2196
02:05:54,119 --> 02:05:54,920
I'm not out.

2197
02:05:54,920 --> 02:05:55,960
I'll just call the bear.

2198
02:05:56,600 --> 02:05:57,960
No, that's a foul ball.

2199
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:01,840
You know, you could do that.

2200
02:06:13,539 --> 02:06:14,180
They're fighting.

2201
02:06:15,380 --> 02:06:15,539
No.

2202
02:06:15,539 --> 02:06:16,579
What about the warranty?

2203
02:06:16,579 --> 02:06:18,979
Yeah, there's no, I don't, I don't think there's a warranty.

2204
02:06:19,619 --> 02:06:21,140
I don't think there's a warranty.

2205
02:06:21,140 --> 02:06:23,859
I said that just because I was talking nonsense.

2206
02:06:24,500 --> 02:06:25,000
Oh, yeah.

2207
02:06:28,869 --> 02:06:33,989
Anyways, let's talk about what that is means.

2208
02:06:35,159 --> 02:06:36,920
Um, I want to make this pretty clear.

2209
02:06:38,149 --> 02:06:39,270
Doing something like this.

2210
02:06:39,909 --> 02:06:42,119
Hey, dude, dollhouse was two years ago.

2211
02:06:42,119 --> 02:06:45,880
The umpire, the baseball association stream was a year ago.

2212
02:06:46,199 --> 02:06:47,000
Why are you doing this now?

2213
02:06:48,149 --> 02:06:54,880
And I think one of the things to really just give you is I think this is probably one of

2214
02:06:54,880 --> 02:06:57,840
the last pieces of merch I'm ever going to do.

2215
02:07:00,310 --> 02:07:01,189
Grotto beasts.

2216
02:07:01,829 --> 02:07:07,140
We still are thinking of maybe some stuff we're thinking of.

2217
02:07:07,140 --> 02:07:12,420
It's possible to do some more with Grotto beasts, but just like Jerma merch, like German

2218
02:07:12,420 --> 02:07:13,539
nine, eight, five merch.

2219
02:07:14,710 --> 02:07:21,989
I don't, I don't know if I have much more plans to do any more me merch.

2220
02:07:21,989 --> 02:07:23,029
If that doesn't make any sense.

2221
02:07:27,250 --> 02:07:28,930
The old man is done.

2222
02:07:28,930 --> 02:07:30,369
No, I am not far from it.

2223
02:07:30,930 --> 02:07:38,319
I talked a little bit in pre stream today and in the discord, but we don't have to get

2224
02:07:38,319 --> 02:07:39,600
too far into it.

2225
02:07:39,600 --> 02:07:46,199
It's just the one thing is it's kind of like memorabilia for me at some point, too.

2226
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:48,279
It's like, hey, the dollhouse stream.

2227
02:07:48,279 --> 02:07:50,119
That's like one of my favorite things I've ever done.

2228
02:07:50,119 --> 02:07:51,960
The baseball stream is one of my favorite things I've ever done.

2229
02:07:53,159 --> 02:07:55,829
And I just, I don't know.

2230
02:07:55,829 --> 02:08:00,149
It's a nice way to, I think, to solidify that it existed for me as well as obviously

2231
02:08:00,149 --> 02:08:01,029
the streams existing.

2232
02:08:01,029 --> 02:08:06,069
But I, these can go on my, you know, jokeyly, these can go on my Reddit shelf and I can

2233
02:08:06,069 --> 02:08:09,750
like look at them and be like, oh yeah, that was, that was the thing that I did.

2234
02:08:14,930 --> 02:08:18,850
But personal merch, this is probably one of the, one of the last ones.

2235
02:08:19,569 --> 02:08:25,159
And I did say Grotto beasts because we're going to talk about Grotto beasts because

2236
02:08:25,159 --> 02:08:27,239
I want to show you a couple of really interesting things, too.

2237
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:31,079
But again, August 28th, those are going to go on sale 12 p.m.

2238
02:08:31,079 --> 02:08:31,640
Pacific.

2239
02:08:32,199 --> 02:08:34,920
I believe they're only going to be available for a limited time.

2240
02:08:34,920 --> 02:08:38,199
This is not going to be like Grotto beast where it's like a presale and then like we

2241
02:08:38,199 --> 02:08:40,439
do another thing and another thing and you can still buy it.

2242
02:08:40,439 --> 02:08:43,239
I'm pretty sure these are only going to be available for a couple, a few weeks.

2243
02:08:44,550 --> 02:08:52,119
So as of August 28th, you'll have all through pretty much most of September.

2244
02:08:56,279 --> 02:08:58,359
But anyways, really cool.

2245
02:08:59,699 --> 02:09:00,979
Dude, talk faster.

2246
02:09:03,720 --> 02:09:05,399
I want to show you something else.

2247
02:09:05,960 --> 02:09:12,930
So Grotto beast tabletop simulator, the digital version is something we've been

2248
02:09:13,569 --> 02:09:15,590
kind of talking about, working on.

2249
02:09:16,229 --> 02:09:21,319
Those of you that have been following that project, the physical version was a great

2250
02:09:21,319 --> 02:09:22,199
success.

2251
02:09:22,199 --> 02:09:24,439
It's, I'm really happy with it.

2252
02:09:24,439 --> 02:09:26,039
All the core team is really happy with it.

2253
02:09:28,279 --> 02:09:31,720
Barring a few bumps along the road, like we knew it was possible.

2254
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:38,800
I want to show you now the progress on the digital tabletop simulator mod that will be

2255
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:39,359
for free.

2256
02:09:40,960 --> 02:09:45,859
So this is the first image that you are going to see.

2257
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:53,760
Here is the Grotto beast tabletop simulator mod that is currently in development right

2258
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:54,399
now.

2259
02:09:54,399 --> 02:09:56,869
It's very, very soon to come out.

2260
02:09:57,510 --> 02:10:02,710
You will see it soon, very soon judging by what the image I'm going to show you today.

2261
02:10:04,420 --> 02:10:06,420
This has all of the cards.

2262
02:10:08,600 --> 02:10:10,680
You can make pretty much any deck you want.

2263
02:10:11,239 --> 02:10:13,720
There's a lot of interesting scripting that went into this.

2264
02:10:14,960 --> 02:10:18,159
Here is the table, which is the rumble ring, the wrestling ring.

2265
02:10:19,510 --> 02:10:21,189
Again, all this is all free.

2266
02:10:21,189 --> 02:10:22,630
Anybody that wants to play it.

2267
02:10:22,630 --> 02:10:28,720
We want to have a good way for people to go and actually hang out and play versus, um,

2268
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:30,800
how the fuck are we going to play a physical card game together?

2269
02:10:31,680 --> 02:10:38,630
And the card game portion was something that was built on top of the merch portion, right?

2270
02:10:38,630 --> 02:10:39,829
Because it was, it was merch.

2271
02:10:39,829 --> 02:10:42,710
It was supposed to be merch, but we had an awesome game designer.

2272
02:10:42,710 --> 02:10:44,470
We had an awesome game built on top of it.

2273
02:10:45,109 --> 02:10:50,640
So here's where you can play it and have it be supported pretty much in perpetuity here.

2274
02:10:51,199 --> 02:10:53,170
Get some more images.

2275
02:10:54,050 --> 02:10:56,930
There's going to be a deck building portion of this.

2276
02:10:57,569 --> 02:10:59,119
You'll be able to craft a deck.

2277
02:11:00,449 --> 02:11:02,050
We have all kinds of plans for this.

2278
02:11:07,279 --> 02:11:14,149
Get your, you make your, your, your entire deck, but not just deck building and deck

2279
02:11:14,149 --> 02:11:16,869
crafting, but let's get a big view.

2280
02:11:17,510 --> 02:11:19,619
Look at how cool this is.

2281
02:11:20,180 --> 02:11:26,369
Isn't it beautiful?

2282
02:11:29,109 --> 02:11:33,670
I told you when I said we were really, I wanted to put some money into it, some time into it,

2283
02:11:33,670 --> 02:11:35,350
actually have people working on it.

2284
02:11:36,310 --> 02:11:37,590
I meant it and we meant that.

2285
02:11:37,590 --> 02:11:40,550
So it's, uh, it's going to be a fun experience.

2286
02:11:40,550 --> 02:11:41,829
It's not just going to be a card game.

2287
02:11:41,829 --> 02:11:43,189
There's going to be other stuff here too.

2288
02:11:43,989 --> 02:11:46,470
You're probably noticing there's like a treasure chest over there.

2289
02:11:46,470 --> 02:11:47,829
What's that stuff on the table?

2290
02:11:47,829 --> 02:11:48,869
What is that cauldron?

2291
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:53,109
There's a lot of stuff that we're going to put in.

2292
02:11:54,279 --> 02:11:54,779
Toys.

2293
02:11:55,399 --> 02:12:00,229
There's going to be lots of little fun activities.

2294
02:12:00,949 --> 02:12:03,000
It's just all free.

2295
02:12:03,560 --> 02:12:05,239
None of this is going to cost any money at all.

2296
02:12:05,239 --> 02:12:10,239
You have to own tabletop simulator as the, that's the only thing you have to have.

2297
02:12:11,880 --> 02:12:17,000
If you have tabletop simulator, any of the patches, any of the updates, any of this,

2298
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,079
you will have for free forever.

2299
02:12:19,800 --> 02:12:22,439
So there's not going to be a cost entry for this.

2300
02:12:23,079 --> 02:12:26,680
So there's the treasure chest.

2301
02:12:27,319 --> 02:12:29,640
What's in the treasure chest?

2302
02:12:30,279 --> 02:12:35,720
Well, you'll have to find out because we can't just tell you everything.

2303
02:12:43,880 --> 02:12:45,880
I, Ooh, what's that in the top left corner?

2304
02:12:46,439 --> 02:12:48,630
You see the end turn button?

2305
02:12:49,270 --> 02:12:51,029
So this tracks a lot of stuff.

2306
02:12:52,739 --> 02:12:59,479
The, the devs that have been working on this, I've put a lot of time into it.

2307
02:13:00,279 --> 02:13:02,199
And it's going to be very fleshed out.

2308
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,720
What I've seen of it so far has been two thumbs up.

2309
02:13:06,359 --> 02:13:11,510
Can I have an arcade?

2310
02:13:11,510 --> 02:13:11,829
Come on.

2311
02:13:11,829 --> 02:13:12,550
You didn't even see that.

2312
02:13:13,270 --> 02:13:15,239
This is all work in progress.

2313
02:13:15,239 --> 02:13:18,279
By the way, this will be, things are probably going to change.

2314
02:13:18,279 --> 02:13:24,039
Things will probably move around a little, but there, there's like the little toy section

2315
02:13:24,039 --> 02:13:32,739
potentially, a little arcade section, space to move around, walk around.

2316
02:13:33,300 --> 02:13:38,960
Somebody said, I'm so sorry for whatever I did to get timed out.

2317
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:40,399
Well, at least you're apologizing for it.

2318
02:13:42,470 --> 02:13:48,050
Is this going to be on steam?

2319
02:13:48,689 --> 02:13:54,210
This is going to just be a free tabletop simulator mod.

2320
02:13:55,670 --> 02:13:57,750
You have to own tabletop simulator.

2321
02:13:57,750 --> 02:14:01,350
Tabletop simulator goes on sale all the time if you don't have it.

2322
02:14:02,149 --> 02:14:07,840
But what is, how much is tabletop right now?

2323
02:14:08,399 --> 02:14:15,510
Is it 20 bucks right now?

2324
02:14:16,310 --> 02:14:23,109
Tabletop goes on sale at least a few times a year or sometimes up 10, five, 10 bucks.

2325
02:14:23,109 --> 02:14:33,960
Usually I'm seeing some, some really interesting comments here, but like what to do with this.

2326
02:14:34,600 --> 02:14:39,680
Instead of just in tabletop simulator, like I said, a couple of months ago, when we first

2327
02:14:39,680 --> 02:14:45,600
were really talking about this, let, let's get this one out first and then we can figure it out.

2328
02:14:49,729 --> 02:14:49,890
Yeah.

2329
02:14:49,890 --> 02:14:50,609
I'll scroll through them again.

2330
02:14:50,609 --> 02:15:01,359
So you can say mobile game, Andy.

2331
02:15:02,159 --> 02:15:06,359
I don't think tabletop is tabletop simulator on iOS.

2332
02:15:13,590 --> 02:15:18,689
Well, I, I wanted to, when we first were talking about doing this, I was like, you know, I want

2333
02:15:18,689 --> 02:15:22,630
to be able to have people like walk around and look at stuff and pick up stuff and throw it

2334
02:15:22,630 --> 02:15:24,789
around and go into the, go to the cauldron and look at it.

2335
02:15:24,789 --> 02:15:28,239
And I want it just to be more than just playing the cards.

2336
02:15:28,800 --> 02:15:34,069
How come you're not playing sorcery?

2337
02:15:34,069 --> 02:15:35,189
Well, we got to talk about some stuff.

2338
02:15:35,750 --> 02:15:43,279
Tabletop also has VR.

2339
02:15:44,100 --> 02:15:44,819
Oh, that's cool.

2340
02:15:45,460 --> 02:15:50,470
And again, it's just a tabletop mod.

2341
02:15:51,029 --> 02:15:52,229
It's not a paid anything.

2342
02:15:52,229 --> 02:15:54,789
It's just the project did really well.

2343
02:15:55,670 --> 02:16:00,789
And I would like to see it be supported and have people be able to actually play it and not have

2344
02:16:00,789 --> 02:16:04,310
to worry about how or where or why, or how am I going to do that?

2345
02:16:04,310 --> 02:16:10,340
If you've got a buddy that wants to play with you, then you can.

2346
02:16:10,340 --> 02:16:12,260
And it's all every, all the cards are here.

2347
02:16:12,819 --> 02:16:15,989
You do not collect them.

2348
02:16:15,989 --> 02:16:17,029
You don't earn them.

2349
02:16:17,029 --> 02:16:17,909
They're just available.

2350
02:16:18,470 --> 02:16:25,909
But that's what I wanted to show today.

2351
02:16:26,550 --> 02:16:30,640
And again, the YouTube stuff, that is the 28th.

2352
02:16:31,199 --> 02:16:33,280
There's no release date on this yet.

2353
02:16:33,840 --> 02:16:37,649
This is kind of just like, hey, it's really close.

2354
02:16:38,370 --> 02:16:44,290
So prepare for a lot of stuff in the GB chat and talking about it and how we're going to

2355
02:16:45,010 --> 02:16:47,250
release it out there and what the plan is.

2356
02:16:47,250 --> 02:16:48,370
It's happening very soon.

2357
02:16:52,159 --> 02:16:52,399
Yeah.

2358
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:57,590
We can now go back to me taking another couple of bites of my BLT.

2359
02:16:58,469 --> 02:17:06,850
I'm going to eat this off camera.

2360
02:17:08,500 --> 02:17:11,059
I can't believe I got the fucking sauce on my face.

2361
02:17:12,360 --> 02:17:12,680
Great.

2362
02:17:16,709 --> 02:17:16,950
Yeah.

2363
02:17:16,950 --> 02:17:17,190
Thanks.

2364
02:17:17,190 --> 02:17:18,790
You two's for even considering it.

2365
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:24,000
Thanks all of you for supporting this channel for the fucking decade plus.

2366
02:17:25,809 --> 02:17:29,879
We're going to be like kind of a nice little, hey, it's dollhouse stuff.

2367
02:17:30,440 --> 02:17:31,000
Remember that?

2368
02:17:35,809 --> 02:17:36,049
Okay.

2369
02:17:36,610 --> 02:17:40,399
I'll take one more bite on camera and then I'm going to do the rest off camera.

2370
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:46,469
It's actually really good.

2371
02:17:48,159 --> 02:17:48,959
See the toasted bread.

2372
02:17:49,680 --> 02:17:54,180
You don't, well, you don't think I had the bread completely.

2373
02:17:54,180 --> 02:17:55,299
I don't think the bread is toasted.

2374
02:17:55,940 --> 02:17:59,059
What are you on about?

2375
02:17:59,620 --> 02:18:27,799
Somebody said, dude, you just, you just Minecraft ate that.

2376
02:18:29,909 --> 02:18:30,950
You add sound effects.

2377
02:18:30,950 --> 02:18:32,389
You got to get sound effects on that.

2378
02:18:32,389 --> 02:18:32,870
You're going to get.

2379
02:18:35,110 --> 02:18:48,979
How is your camera from 2001?

2380
02:18:50,290 --> 02:18:51,010
I don't care.

2381
02:18:51,649 --> 02:18:55,350
Oh my God.

2382
02:18:55,350 --> 02:18:56,610
Okay.

2383
02:18:56,610 --> 02:18:57,569
All right.

2384
02:18:57,569 --> 02:18:59,030
I'm going to slowly eat the rest of this.

2385
02:19:00,159 --> 02:19:04,399
Give me one more second while I put this, some of this, these figurines away.

2386
02:19:07,680 --> 02:19:09,040
Very exciting stuff.

2387
02:19:10,719 --> 02:19:12,129
I'll see you guys in like two minutes.

2388
02:19:14,629 --> 02:23:28,290
I'm being reminded that I put BLT in D tier.

2389
02:23:28,290 --> 02:23:28,530
Yeah.

2390
02:23:28,530 --> 02:23:30,579
Well, I'm kind of full of shit.

2391
02:23:30,579 --> 02:23:32,100
I think you've probably figured that out over the years.

2392
02:23:35,479 --> 02:23:45,379
Hey, can I take the door off?

2393
02:23:45,379 --> 02:23:49,219
Oh, I'm going to, I got a hiccup because I got it like two hiccups off stream,

2394
02:23:49,219 --> 02:23:50,180
but I'm going to pull this one.

2395
02:23:57,799 --> 02:23:58,040
Yeah.

2396
02:23:58,040 --> 02:24:02,760
The, I, all jokes aside, I, I don't think there's a fucking warranty on these.

2397
02:24:02,760 --> 02:24:03,319
I don't know.

2398
02:24:03,319 --> 02:24:04,360
You have to look at the terms.

2399
02:24:06,209 --> 02:24:08,930
I'm not going to say that and be completely wrong.

2400
02:24:08,930 --> 02:24:10,930
I did some, it's a, it's an adult figurine.

2401
02:24:17,110 --> 02:24:30,340
Oh, um, I, I can't laugh like that.

2402
02:24:30,340 --> 02:24:31,139
God damn it.

2403
02:24:31,940 --> 02:24:32,180
Okay.

2404
02:24:36,120 --> 02:24:43,329
Uh, you can't retire yet.

2405
02:24:43,329 --> 02:24:47,750
Somebody said, we'll talk about that when I need to.

2406
02:24:49,219 --> 02:24:49,620
Jess?

2407
02:24:49,620 --> 02:24:51,620
No, still here.

2408
02:24:52,870 --> 02:24:53,590
Still here.

2409
02:24:55,700 --> 02:24:57,620
Uh, we're not gonna, we're not talking about that right now.

2410
02:24:57,620 --> 02:25:02,260
He's going to have to talk.

2411
02:25:02,260 --> 02:25:03,700
No, we're not talking about that right now.

2412
02:25:05,350 --> 02:25:08,309
If you really want to know what we talked about in pre-stream,

2413
02:25:08,950 --> 02:25:13,879
it's, uh, you can go look, but it's not something I really want to bring up right now.

2414
02:25:13,879 --> 02:25:22,069
Just know that there are plans in the short to medium term to eat another BLT on stream.

2415
02:25:22,629 --> 02:25:23,299
Okay.

2416
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:27,649
All right.

2417
02:25:27,649 --> 02:25:29,090
What are we, uh, where are we going?

2418
02:25:29,090 --> 02:25:30,069
What are we doing?

2419
02:25:30,709 --> 02:25:33,010
Looks so good.

2420
02:25:33,569 --> 02:25:33,969
Look at that.

2421
02:25:34,530 --> 02:25:37,090
Where are we going?

2422
02:25:39,920 --> 02:25:41,680
Oh, you're not allowed to retire.

2423
02:25:41,680 --> 02:25:43,280
Well, that's for me to decide.

2424
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:44,959
Okay.

2425
02:25:45,600 --> 02:25:46,870
Okay.

2426
02:25:47,670 --> 02:25:53,840
Do you want a tomato town?

2427
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,899
No, that's mine.

2428
02:25:56,899 --> 02:26:08,440
I get to keep the two-handed lightning sword or the offhand orb that gives you 30% resistance

2429
02:26:08,440 --> 02:26:09,940
to fucking fire.

2430
02:26:09,940 --> 02:26:10,899
That's mine.

2431
02:26:10,899 --> 02:26:12,180
You're, you can't have it.

2432
02:26:12,899 --> 02:26:13,139
All right.

2433
02:26:13,139 --> 02:26:15,780
I want to go to the, I want to go in like this way.

2434
02:26:16,739 --> 02:26:23,250
Can you take a shit in this game?

2435
02:26:24,129 --> 02:26:31,479
Um, I think you actually might be able to, I could be wrong.

2436
02:26:31,479 --> 02:26:32,840
That's actually pretty possible.

2437
02:26:33,399 --> 02:26:33,879
Maybe.

2438
02:26:34,520 --> 02:26:34,760
Okay.

2439
02:26:34,760 --> 02:26:44,719
There is an unshakable gloom about this place.

2440
02:26:44,719 --> 02:26:53,190
A few birds are singing thin and miserable songs.

2441
02:26:53,190 --> 02:26:55,110
A thin plume of smoke rises to the east.

2442
02:26:55,670 --> 02:26:56,469
Look at the smoke.

2443
02:26:57,030 --> 02:27:03,000
From what you can make out, the smoke seems to be rising steadily, but thinly.

2444
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,989
It is more like a mist than a smoke from a bonfire.

2445
02:27:06,629 --> 02:27:07,909
You slip onwards through the crater.

2446
02:27:08,639 --> 02:27:10,159
Can you use a neti pot in this game?

2447
02:27:10,799 --> 02:27:11,040
No.

2448
02:27:12,200 --> 02:27:12,440
All right.

2449
02:27:12,440 --> 02:27:15,569
I want to go to the, I'm going to the smoke.

2450
02:27:16,129 --> 02:27:17,250
I'm actually glad I ate that BLT.

2451
02:27:17,250 --> 02:27:21,059
I feel like way better.

2452
02:27:23,010 --> 02:27:23,170
Okay.

2453
02:27:23,170 --> 02:27:26,340
I'm going to go to the, I'm going to go to the smoke.

2454
02:27:26,340 --> 02:27:26,979
I'm actually glad I ate that BLT.

2455
02:27:26,979 --> 02:27:27,860
I feel like way better.

2456
02:27:28,579 --> 02:27:30,000
I hadn't eaten that much today.

2457
02:27:30,639 --> 02:27:36,159
You break from the trail and head across the loose dirt towards the rising smoke.

2458
02:27:36,719 --> 02:27:38,399
The air begins to get warm.

2459
02:27:38,399 --> 02:27:43,360
Sweat trickles down your back as you get closer to what appears to be a crack deep in the earth.

2460
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:49,719
Approach the fissure.

2461
02:27:50,600 --> 02:27:52,600
You make your way carefully to the fissure's edge.

2462
02:27:52,600 --> 02:27:56,600
It is almost pleasantly warm here with soft moss underneath your feet.

2463
02:27:57,239 --> 02:28:01,239
Superheated steam bursts up every few minutes with a hiss.

2464
02:28:02,120 --> 02:28:04,280
There's something else on the air too.

2465
02:28:04,280 --> 02:28:05,399
The sounds of the wind.

2466
02:28:05,399 --> 02:28:07,319
Surely not voices.

2467
02:28:07,959 --> 02:28:15,510
What can I do here?

2468
02:28:25,010 --> 02:28:25,729
So it's hot.

2469
02:28:29,120 --> 02:28:31,920
Um, talk all languages.

2470
02:28:31,920 --> 02:28:33,360
Can I talk to the crater?

2471
02:28:34,079 --> 02:28:36,690
This is the easy thing to do.

2472
02:28:43,379 --> 02:28:43,700
Yeah.

2473
02:28:44,520 --> 02:28:45,079
Always suss.

2474
02:28:46,040 --> 02:28:47,639
Craft the spell.

2475
02:28:47,639 --> 02:28:49,399
A calm voice speaks into your thoughts.

2476
02:28:50,879 --> 02:28:52,159
There's little to fear here.

2477
02:28:53,350 --> 02:28:54,069
Echoes.

2478
02:28:55,350 --> 02:28:56,069
Nothing more.

2479
02:28:58,440 --> 02:28:59,479
I'll prove it to you.

2480
02:29:06,709 --> 02:29:07,209
Hello!

2481
02:29:08,950 --> 02:29:09,450
Hello!

2482
02:29:13,360 --> 02:29:16,280
See, I told you that's all that was here.

2483
02:29:20,840 --> 02:29:21,649
Okay.

2484
02:29:21,649 --> 02:29:23,889
The vent is a jagged crack in the earth.

2485
02:29:24,530 --> 02:29:26,530
The black stone is deeply cut.

2486
02:29:27,090 --> 02:29:30,690
Strange shapes flicker within the rising jets of steam, seemingly murmuring.

2487
02:29:31,329 --> 02:29:35,110
But whatever your spell says, you can definitely hear voices.

2488
02:29:35,110 --> 02:29:36,149
Where are they coming from?

2489
02:29:40,690 --> 02:29:43,559
Um, let's listen.

2490
02:29:44,200 --> 02:29:47,879
Straining to listen, you make out distinct voices coming from deep inside the vent.

2491
02:29:48,440 --> 02:29:52,680
It is like standing on a balcony above a room full of whispering people,

2492
02:29:52,680 --> 02:29:54,920
all crowding for attention at the edge of your hearing.

2493
02:29:55,639 --> 02:29:57,399
But how can anyone survive down here?

2494
02:29:57,959 --> 02:30:00,600
There are no creatures near the vent, despite the warmth it provides.

2495
02:30:03,219 --> 02:30:03,719
Oh, yeah.

2496
02:30:06,579 --> 02:30:09,799
I said, who's there?

2497
02:30:09,799 --> 02:30:10,440
You call out.

2498
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:14,120
The voices become louder in response, crowding over each other.

2499
02:30:14,120 --> 02:30:16,120
They're speaking a language you do not recognize.

2500
02:30:20,360 --> 02:30:21,559
But there's nothing here.

2501
02:30:24,239 --> 02:30:24,799
Echoes.

2502
02:30:27,600 --> 02:30:30,229
Can I talk on languages?

2503
02:30:31,670 --> 02:30:37,459
Cause sleepiness.

2504
02:30:38,180 --> 02:30:45,440
Can I understand if I put this on?

2505
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:51,170
Pulling out the green wig, you put it on and cast the spell.

2506
02:30:51,729 --> 02:30:57,889
The voices from the crater transform into a cacophony of overlapping curses, wails, and

2507
02:30:57,889 --> 02:30:58,530
complaints.

2508
02:30:59,329 --> 02:31:00,290
They're confused.

2509
02:31:00,930 --> 02:31:02,610
Many of them hardly make sense.

2510
02:31:03,329 --> 02:31:05,860
Okay.

2511
02:31:05,860 --> 02:31:06,899
Let me say, I'm going to speak to them.

2512
02:31:07,459 --> 02:31:09,700
You greet the voices and they respond with surprise.

2513
02:31:10,340 --> 02:31:12,100
Green shadows flicker near the vent.

2514
02:31:16,879 --> 02:31:17,920
You can hear us?

2515
02:31:18,559 --> 02:31:21,590
Can you see us as well?

2516
02:31:22,469 --> 02:31:23,510
Do we exist?

2517
02:31:25,909 --> 02:31:27,030
I do exist.

2518
02:31:31,649 --> 02:31:32,930
Yes, you lie.

2519
02:31:32,930 --> 02:31:35,670
The tension eases, but many still swirl and cry.

2520
02:31:39,760 --> 02:31:40,799
Who are you?

2521
02:31:40,799 --> 02:31:44,760
We are the dead of Agbad.

2522
02:31:45,479 --> 02:31:47,079
We lived in a village here.

2523
02:31:47,879 --> 02:31:48,920
It is lost.

2524
02:31:49,639 --> 02:31:52,370
A village?

2525
02:31:52,930 --> 02:31:53,430
Here?

2526
02:31:54,049 --> 02:31:56,979
The earth was not cracked when the village was built.

2527
02:31:57,620 --> 02:32:00,899
How did you die?

2528
02:32:01,989 --> 02:32:03,190
The earth opened.

2529
02:32:03,190 --> 02:32:05,670
Every house was lost into the fire.

2530
02:32:06,389 --> 02:32:08,709
This vent is all that is left.

2531
02:32:08,709 --> 02:32:10,229
And we are trapped.

2532
02:32:10,229 --> 02:32:12,309
The rock's pressing and heat burning.

2533
02:32:14,879 --> 02:32:16,559
I still feel it on my skin.

2534
02:32:17,360 --> 02:32:22,020
Can I aid you?

2535
02:32:22,020 --> 02:32:24,100
How can one aid the dead?

2536
02:32:24,899 --> 02:32:26,659
Put out the fire!

2537
02:32:27,379 --> 02:32:28,899
Are you not the Anor Lander?

2538
02:32:29,620 --> 02:32:31,000
Who's that?

2539
02:32:35,909 --> 02:32:37,190
Uh, should I say yes?

2540
02:32:42,450 --> 02:32:46,709
I'm gonna say it.

2541
02:32:46,709 --> 02:32:49,270
I am the Anor Lander, you declare.

2542
02:32:50,069 --> 02:32:51,440
The great one.

2543
02:32:51,440 --> 02:32:52,719
The one who was to come.

2544
02:32:53,280 --> 02:32:54,239
Our savior.

2545
02:32:54,239 --> 02:32:54,879
Our hope.

2546
02:32:56,639 --> 02:32:57,840
It is too late for you.

2547
02:32:58,399 --> 02:32:59,200
You are dead.

2548
02:33:00,420 --> 02:33:03,059
Rivers of death run under the citadel beyond.

2549
02:33:03,620 --> 02:33:08,659
The people within are trapped in their lives as grain in the Archmage's mill.

2550
02:33:10,739 --> 02:33:13,059
Oh, break the spell.

2551
02:33:13,059 --> 02:33:13,780
Break him.

2552
02:33:14,659 --> 02:33:16,100
We will rise.

2553
02:33:16,899 --> 02:33:21,379
How can I reach him?

2554
02:33:23,170 --> 02:33:25,170
He hides in his tower.

2555
02:33:25,809 --> 02:33:27,569
He hides from us.

2556
02:33:27,569 --> 02:33:28,690
From the dead.

2557
02:33:28,690 --> 02:33:29,329
From death.

2558
02:33:30,229 --> 02:33:32,790
But his tower door has a key.

2559
02:33:33,590 --> 02:33:37,219
Something rolls up from the vent and rests by your foot.

2560
02:33:37,219 --> 02:33:38,020
You pick it up.

2561
02:33:38,020 --> 02:33:40,899
It's a vial of water that sparkles with light.

2562
02:33:43,079 --> 02:33:44,840
Do not drop it.

2563
02:33:45,479 --> 02:33:48,899
It is blessed by Kaathe himself.

2564
02:33:50,629 --> 02:33:51,909
King, I don't want this shit!

2565
02:33:52,549 --> 02:33:53,590
Kick it back into the vent.

2566
02:33:58,040 --> 02:33:58,920
You're dead.

2567
02:33:58,920 --> 02:33:59,719
We're yet to live.

2568
02:34:00,600 --> 02:34:01,319
You lift it up.

2569
02:34:01,319 --> 02:34:02,840
A vial of holy water.

2570
02:34:02,840 --> 02:34:03,799
Powerful, certainly.

2571
02:34:03,799 --> 02:34:06,280
But how will it open the door of the Archmage's tower?

2572
02:34:06,920 --> 02:34:08,440
The spell begins to fade.

2573
02:34:08,440 --> 02:34:13,079
You take the wig from your head and their words become meaningless sounds once more.

2574
02:34:13,079 --> 02:34:16,420
The steam hisses up and then settles on the nearby moss like dew.

2575
02:34:17,219 --> 02:34:19,219
Hold the vial up to the light.

2576
02:34:20,479 --> 02:34:23,200
You lift the vial to the light and for a moment you seem to see

2577
02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:26,799
laughing faces of a cruel god in the shimmers of light.

2578
02:34:27,829 --> 02:34:28,549
Then it is gone.

2579
02:34:29,190 --> 02:34:32,739
I don't have a god right now.

2580
02:34:32,739 --> 02:34:34,959
I'm currently godless.

2581
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:37,010
There's no god here.

2582
02:34:38,479 --> 02:34:45,889
Um, why would I use this right now though?

2583
02:34:58,469 --> 02:34:59,430
I don't think I want to do anything.

2584
02:35:02,610 --> 02:35:05,489
As you turn, you hear something approaching you from behind.

2585
02:35:06,049 --> 02:35:07,729
A voice murmurs in your ear.

2586
02:35:10,850 --> 02:35:12,479
There you are.

2587
02:35:12,479 --> 02:35:15,760
Then you feel the definite presence of a hand resting across your back.

2588
02:35:17,040 --> 02:35:18,000
What is going on?

2589
02:35:18,559 --> 02:35:23,139
You sit up sharply to find a glowing presence holding a curved dagger

2590
02:35:23,139 --> 02:35:25,379
that has been stroking up and down your back.

2591
02:35:26,399 --> 02:35:27,440
It is a death wraith.

2592
02:35:28,079 --> 02:35:30,079
Leering at you from under its death mask.

2593
02:35:31,059 --> 02:35:33,700
In one bony hand it holds something up.

2594
02:35:33,700 --> 02:35:35,620
Something short and white and stubby.

2595
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:38,959
I have been looking for you.

2596
02:35:39,680 --> 02:35:42,420
I have developed a taste for you, you see.

2597
02:35:44,520 --> 02:35:47,959
It opens its jaw revealing a terrible black void

2598
02:35:47,959 --> 02:35:50,680
and it delicately pops the thing into its mouth.

2599
02:35:54,149 --> 02:35:56,309
Wheeled by magic chain.

2600
02:36:06,079 --> 02:36:06,579
Thinking-

2601
02:36:06,579 --> 02:36:07,079
Whoa!

2602
02:36:10,870 --> 02:36:11,370
What?

2603
02:36:13,739 --> 02:36:15,500
Why do I have such a little bar?

2604
02:36:20,700 --> 02:36:21,500
I can't do this.

2605
02:36:24,709 --> 02:36:27,959
I actually might be able to do it.

2606
02:36:32,979 --> 02:36:33,479
That's bad.

2607
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,879
He just did two full blasts at 4.7?

2608
02:36:38,680 --> 02:36:41,530
That's kind of annoying.

2609
02:36:46,200 --> 02:36:46,700
Oh!

2610
02:36:47,079 --> 02:36:47,579
Okay.

2611
02:36:49,270 --> 02:36:52,469
Warm air seems to cool but you seize the moment to strike.

2612
02:36:52,469 --> 02:36:55,270
You lash the death wraith with your length of chain.

2613
02:36:55,270 --> 02:36:59,670
You cut across its cruel blade and the wraith moves between the boulders.

2614
02:36:59,670 --> 02:37:01,350
It does not bleed but it seems to flicker.

2615
02:37:01,909 --> 02:37:03,750
It leans forward with crooked hands.

2616
02:37:04,549 --> 02:37:05,989
Your heart will be mine.

2617
02:37:06,549 --> 02:37:07,350
It will stop.

2618
02:37:09,129 --> 02:37:09,629
Um.

2619
02:37:11,909 --> 02:37:12,549
I had to do that.

2620
02:37:13,190 --> 02:37:14,629
I'm in so much trouble.

2621
02:37:14,629 --> 02:37:15,510
I'm in a lot of trouble.

2622
02:37:16,149 --> 02:37:19,639
I can't.

2623
02:37:20,500 --> 02:37:21,299
I'm- I can't.

2624
02:37:22,100 --> 02:37:25,479
Okay, you stumble and fall.

2625
02:37:25,479 --> 02:37:27,559
The wraith grins its bony teeth.

2626
02:37:27,559 --> 02:37:29,000
Okay, so do you think I can do it now?

2627
02:37:29,559 --> 02:37:30,440
Like 1.7?

2628
02:37:31,239 --> 02:37:31,739
No.

2629
02:37:33,079 --> 02:37:33,579
Shit.

2630
02:37:37,940 --> 02:37:38,739
Oh, come on.

2631
02:37:40,819 --> 02:37:41,860
Uh, this- I'm dead.

2632
02:37:42,420 --> 02:37:45,340
It's a loss.

2633
02:37:49,020 --> 02:37:49,659
Oh, shit.

2634
02:37:49,659 --> 02:37:50,379
I gotta do this again.

2635
02:37:50,940 --> 02:38:07,780
Okay, so how do I beat the wraith?

2636
02:38:08,420 --> 02:38:20,459
I'm just picking the same things I already did.

2637
02:38:22,760 --> 02:38:23,260
Um.

2638
02:38:24,760 --> 02:38:25,639
Can I aid you?

2639
02:38:28,780 --> 02:38:29,659
Put out the fire.

2640
02:38:29,659 --> 02:38:31,020
Okay, I'm the Anor Lander.

2641
02:38:31,659 --> 02:38:33,639
Is it- is it too late for you?

2642
02:38:34,440 --> 02:38:35,579
How can I reach him?

2643
02:38:36,379 --> 02:38:37,500
The door has a key.

2644
02:38:38,549 --> 02:38:41,270
Uh, this is apparently- this holy water is a key.

2645
02:38:41,270 --> 02:38:41,829
Hold it up.

2646
02:38:41,829 --> 02:38:42,389
Take a look.

2647
02:38:43,370 --> 02:38:43,870
Okay.

2648
02:38:45,750 --> 02:38:46,309
That's it.

2649
02:38:46,309 --> 02:38:47,270
Make a move.

2650
02:38:47,270 --> 02:38:47,909
Here we are.

2651
02:38:47,909 --> 02:38:48,409
Okay.

2652
02:38:49,030 --> 02:38:49,670
Turn around.

2653
02:38:53,899 --> 02:38:54,540
All right.

2654
02:38:54,620 --> 02:38:56,379
I've developed a taste for you, you see.

2655
02:38:58,489 --> 02:39:00,010
Okay, he puts the thing in his mouth.

2656
02:39:00,819 --> 02:39:01,540
What was that?

2657
02:39:02,870 --> 02:39:04,469
You didn't recognize it?

2658
02:39:06,969 --> 02:39:07,469
Figures.

2659
02:39:09,209 --> 02:39:09,770
Fingers!

2660
02:39:10,489 --> 02:39:13,610
The empty stub on your hand throbs where you lost your finger.

2661
02:39:18,889 --> 02:39:19,389
Uh.

2662
02:39:28,219 --> 02:39:29,180
Well, that's weird.

2663
02:39:33,020 --> 02:39:36,299
Wait, could I cause fear with the face mask?

2664
02:39:37,020 --> 02:39:39,319
I'm afraid that's not gonna do anything.

2665
02:39:39,319 --> 02:39:39,879
It's a wraith.

2666
02:39:46,260 --> 02:39:47,219
Oh, it's not gonna work.

2667
02:39:54,790 --> 02:39:55,290
Shield.

2668
02:40:03,770 --> 02:40:05,930
Dim is stu- wait, can I make him stupid?

2669
02:40:06,649 --> 02:40:13,610
You craft the spell, but it seems to have no effect on the death wraith.

2670
02:40:13,610 --> 02:40:15,610
Perhaps it has no mind to muddle.

2671
02:40:16,250 --> 02:40:21,739
Where did you get that finger?

2672
02:40:22,379 --> 02:40:25,450
Dug it out of a hillside in the dirt.

2673
02:40:26,170 --> 02:40:27,610
I've been following you ever since.

2674
02:40:28,250 --> 02:40:29,909
My darling.

2675
02:40:32,709 --> 02:40:33,430
Give it back.

2676
02:40:34,870 --> 02:40:36,709
Oh, it's no use to you now.

2677
02:40:37,270 --> 02:40:39,610
Besides, I've come to ask you for another.

2678
02:40:40,250 --> 02:40:41,670
How am I gonna beat this?

2679
02:40:41,670 --> 02:40:42,549
This is impossible.

2680
02:40:43,110 --> 02:40:47,959
How am I supposed to beat this?

2681
02:40:58,149 --> 02:40:58,950
Okay, I don't-

2682
02:40:59,510 --> 02:41:04,149
I have to get either really lucky or maybe like a defense thing?

2683
02:41:05,850 --> 02:41:14,469
Uh, I don't think I can physically win this fight.

2684
02:41:15,190 --> 02:41:19,290
I mean, that's all right, but I- my stamina is so low.

2685
02:41:21,989 --> 02:41:23,510
I can't go over two, no matter what.

2686
02:41:27,670 --> 02:41:31,750
I have to defend until- until he does like a 10.0.

2687
02:41:32,389 --> 02:41:35,450
I guess I could try.

2688
02:41:35,450 --> 02:41:36,809
No, I think the same thing's gonna happen.

2689
02:41:37,829 --> 02:41:38,629
Oh, come on!

2690
02:41:39,350 --> 02:41:56,469
Okay, now's my chance.

2691
02:42:02,899 --> 02:42:03,399
Stop!

2692
02:42:03,860 --> 02:42:09,340
Okay, just- just kill me because I'm- I-

2693
02:42:10,219 --> 02:42:20,920
So, I think I just defend two times in a row.

2694
02:42:21,639 --> 02:42:22,920
Defend two times in a row.

2695
02:42:23,559 --> 02:42:28,020
I'm gonna try it again.

2696
02:42:34,649 --> 02:42:35,610
Okay, so defend.

2697
02:42:36,649 --> 02:42:38,040
Defend again.

2698
02:42:38,760 --> 02:42:46,819
So now, you steady your chain.

2699
02:42:46,819 --> 02:42:48,260
The deathwraith wails and sings.

2700
02:42:48,260 --> 02:42:50,180
It slashes its blade backwards and forwards.

2701
02:42:50,180 --> 02:42:51,139
You parry in a flash.

2702
02:42:51,860 --> 02:42:54,260
You can't have any more in the tank.

2703
02:42:54,819 --> 02:42:55,379
There we go.

2704
02:42:56,260 --> 02:42:57,639
Okay.

2705
02:42:58,260 --> 02:43:01,290
Should I do it again?

2706
02:43:01,290 --> 02:43:02,090
1.0, right?

2707
02:43:03,909 --> 02:43:05,030
Oh, fuck.

2708
02:43:05,030 --> 02:43:09,139
I think I just blew it.

2709
02:43:13,100 --> 02:43:14,620
No, I wouldn't be able to do it here either.

2710
02:43:16,299 --> 02:43:17,659
I will come for your blood.

2711
02:43:17,659 --> 02:43:18,379
I will- okay.

2712
02:43:19,690 --> 02:43:20,809
Good, good, good, good, good, good.

2713
02:43:20,809 --> 02:43:22,170
Okay, I just have to do that two more times.

2714
02:43:22,809 --> 02:43:26,870
Should I go for a tiny one?

2715
02:43:27,430 --> 02:43:31,879
Do you think I should go for like a little one?

2716
02:43:31,879 --> 02:43:32,600
Or just defend?

2717
02:43:35,930 --> 02:43:36,430
Shit.

2718
02:43:36,809 --> 02:43:37,770
I'm gonna have to defend again.

2719
02:43:38,489 --> 02:43:42,430
Okay.

2720
02:43:43,510 --> 02:43:45,030
I think- is this the opportunity here to get-

2721
02:43:46,709 --> 02:43:47,030
Good.

2722
02:43:47,030 --> 02:43:47,909
Okay, just one more.

2723
02:43:47,909 --> 02:43:48,629
One more and I got it.

2724
02:43:49,190 --> 02:43:52,139
Should I go again?

2725
02:43:53,860 --> 02:43:54,739
That was a bad move.

2726
02:43:55,930 --> 02:43:57,290
Oh, I blew it big time.

2727
02:43:58,010 --> 02:44:02,010
I blew it big time.

2728
02:44:02,010 --> 02:44:02,809
I wouldn't- I can't.

2729
02:44:03,370 --> 02:44:04,250
I have to defend again.

2730
02:44:05,700 --> 02:44:07,219
Now I might be able to get it with one health.

2731
02:44:07,219 --> 02:44:07,719
Let's see.

2732
02:44:08,340 --> 02:44:10,010
1.7.

2733
02:44:10,649 --> 02:44:11,149
Yes!

2734
02:44:11,850 --> 02:44:17,270
You power at the wraith.

2735
02:44:17,989 --> 02:44:20,309
With a final strike, the creature wails and moans,

2736
02:44:20,309 --> 02:44:22,069
seeming to vanish in on itself.

2737
02:44:22,069 --> 02:44:24,549
The air is suddenly a little warmer, one health left.

2738
02:44:27,379 --> 02:44:31,459
You pant breathlessly, still shivering from the creature's terrible chewing smile.

2739
02:44:32,100 --> 02:44:34,979
The air cools as you move away from the vent.

2740
02:44:35,700 --> 02:44:37,319
What's the new clue?

2741
02:44:39,110 --> 02:44:40,709
Oh, the door, the door, the door.

2742
02:44:41,350 --> 02:44:43,930
Okay, well that was disastrous, but we're okay.

2743
02:44:44,649 --> 02:44:52,680
It could have been way worse.

2744
02:44:53,239 --> 02:45:06,489
Do I have-

2745
02:45:06,489 --> 02:45:06,989
What?

2746
02:45:07,690 --> 02:45:19,260
You make your way around to the front of the low building.

2747
02:45:19,260 --> 02:45:21,899
The air moves a little around you, still icy but fresh.

2748
02:45:24,180 --> 02:45:24,899
Look at it.

2749
02:45:24,899 --> 02:45:27,799
The wind washes through the upper story,

2750
02:45:27,799 --> 02:45:30,920
and gripweed and yellow brightspark peer out from the shattered windows.

2751
02:45:31,479 --> 02:45:33,399
The building was perhaps once an inn,

2752
02:45:33,399 --> 02:45:34,280
perhaps a trading post,

2753
02:45:34,280 --> 02:45:38,040
perhaps a place for guides to welcome newcomers to the great fortress beyond.

2754
02:45:38,040 --> 02:45:40,360
Now it has crumbled to half its state.

2755
02:45:40,360 --> 02:45:44,549
Pick the brightspark.

2756
02:45:44,549 --> 02:45:48,579
You pluck a sprig of brightspark.

2757
02:45:48,579 --> 02:45:52,920
It has bright yellow flowers, but it is completely useless as most wild plants are,

2758
02:45:52,920 --> 02:45:55,110
so quickly you toss it aside.

2759
02:45:55,110 --> 02:46:01,750
I can't use it for anything?

2760
02:46:01,750 --> 02:46:02,469
This is dangerous.

2761
02:46:02,469 --> 02:46:03,670
I probably shouldn't go in here, but I'm gonna.

2762
02:46:05,639 --> 02:46:07,239
I don't remember what happens in here.

2763
02:46:07,239 --> 02:46:09,139
Okay, let's go in.

2764
02:46:09,139 --> 02:46:15,379
You enter the crumbling building.

2765
02:46:15,379 --> 02:46:18,979
It is missing its roof, so you are exposed to the sky.

2766
02:46:18,979 --> 02:46:21,540
Search the building.

2767
02:46:21,540 --> 02:46:25,879
With great care, you search the rest of the room, but find nothing of interest.

2768
02:46:25,879 --> 02:46:28,100
The building is quite empty.

2769
02:46:28,100 --> 02:46:31,700
Carved on one wall is what appears to be a scratched message.

2770
02:46:31,700 --> 02:46:35,209
Read it.

2771
02:46:35,209 --> 02:46:38,309
You read over the message.

2772
02:46:38,309 --> 02:46:38,709
Third...

2773
02:46:39,750 --> 02:46:40,760
That...

2774
02:46:40,760 --> 02:46:42,120
Throbin doors is...

2775
02:46:43,319 --> 02:46:44,940
Invisib...

2776
02:46:44,940 --> 02:46:45,579
Curious.

2777
02:46:45,579 --> 02:46:54,309
The third spell that opened the Throbin doors is the spell of invisibility.

2778
02:46:54,309 --> 02:47:02,659
The third spell is the spell of invisibility.

2779
02:47:02,659 --> 02:47:03,540
Very cool.

2780
02:47:03,540 --> 02:47:08,790
You take a moment to rest admiring the sky, but you cannot wait here forever.

2781
02:47:08,790 --> 02:47:09,989
You must keep moving.

2782
02:47:09,989 --> 02:47:11,670
Then there's nothing more to find.

2783
02:47:11,670 --> 02:47:19,700
You slip outside of the age building and back into the light.

2784
02:47:19,700 --> 02:47:20,979
High performance IQ.

2785
02:47:20,979 --> 02:47:24,549
I'm personally timing you out for one second.

2786
02:47:24,549 --> 02:47:25,430
Actually, no, no, no.

2787
02:47:25,430 --> 02:47:26,149
I think that was a compliment.

2788
02:47:26,149 --> 02:47:26,709
Never mind.

2789
02:47:26,709 --> 02:47:30,809
You can stay.

2790
02:47:30,809 --> 02:47:33,770
You step back out onto the trail and look around once more.

2791
02:47:33,770 --> 02:47:35,930
Paths lead in several directions.

2792
02:47:35,930 --> 02:47:39,899
Let me take a look.

2793
02:47:39,899 --> 02:47:49,860
So this is going right up kind of main street here, leading us here.

2794
02:47:49,860 --> 02:47:56,940
It's also going north this way, maybe across the rocks.

2795
02:47:56,940 --> 02:48:02,100
I think I'm just gonna go up.

2796
02:48:02,100 --> 02:48:12,299
Let's go up the road.

2797
02:48:12,299 --> 02:48:15,379
A few clouds scud across the sky.

2798
02:48:15,379 --> 02:48:19,399
The trail passes a deep crack in the rock which extends southwards,

2799
02:48:19,399 --> 02:48:20,760
growing deeper and wider.

2800
02:48:21,399 --> 02:48:24,520
There's no way across the fissure, but the path leads in either direction past it.

2801
02:48:29,100 --> 02:48:31,340
His toupee is strangling his brain.

2802
02:48:31,899 --> 02:48:38,739
You ever put a hat on and you feel like that's actually happening?

2803
02:48:38,739 --> 02:48:41,459
A hat has to be fitted just right for me.

2804
02:48:42,260 --> 02:48:50,760
Or I either look like I'm five years old or I feel like my head's gonna explode.

2805
02:48:50,760 --> 02:48:54,139
I'm so bad getting hats that fit.

2806
02:48:54,139 --> 02:49:02,040
They never fit correctly for me.

2807
02:49:02,040 --> 02:49:04,280
You make your way up the curve, dusty rim of the crater.

2808
02:49:04,280 --> 02:49:06,569
An open path leads forward and up.

2809
02:49:06,569 --> 02:49:10,700
Skyline is suddenly dominated by the looming specter of Mampang.

2810
02:49:10,700 --> 02:49:14,600
As the morning moves on, the wind begins to rise.

2811
02:49:14,600 --> 02:49:15,639
Look at the citadel.

2812
02:49:15,639 --> 02:49:21,190
Spellbound by its presence, your eyes follow the lines of the citadel's walls.

2813
02:49:21,190 --> 02:49:26,540
Gnarled spires twist upwards towards the sky as if in agonized prayers to the heavens.

2814
02:49:26,540 --> 02:49:30,379
Sharp angles and jagged points protrude everywhere.

2815
02:49:30,379 --> 02:49:33,819
Demonic gargoyles line the outside walls.

2816
02:49:33,819 --> 02:49:34,540
Look away.

2817
02:49:34,540 --> 02:49:37,930
You try to look away, but you cannot.

2818
02:49:37,930 --> 02:49:40,870
It is as though the towers have gripped your eyes.

2819
02:49:40,870 --> 02:49:43,909
The sight would be enough to break the courage of any brave soldier,

2820
02:49:43,909 --> 02:49:46,069
and its effect on you is much the same.

2821
02:49:46,069 --> 02:49:50,680
You feel a knot of fear bury itself in your stomach where you cannot shake it.

2822
02:49:50,680 --> 02:49:53,620
Despite shivering at the sight of the citadel,

2823
02:49:53,620 --> 02:49:56,020
you feel yourself compelled to step forward.

2824
02:49:56,020 --> 02:50:03,450
All right, here we go.

2825
02:50:03,450 --> 02:50:06,170
Here we go into Mampang.

2826
02:50:06,170 --> 02:50:12,899
You clamber up the far slope of the crater until you are on the main road once more.

2827
02:50:12,899 --> 02:50:15,000
Look down the pass.

2828
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:19,190
There are most likely guards stationed with a view over the pass.

2829
02:50:19,270 --> 02:50:22,549
This is the only route into the citadel and is certain to be guarded.

2830
02:50:22,549 --> 02:50:25,299
Then suddenly you feel a wave of nausea.

2831
02:50:25,299 --> 02:50:26,680
The ground beneath you shifts.

2832
02:50:26,680 --> 02:50:29,000
The sun slides sideways.

2833
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:30,920
Oh boy.

2834
02:50:30,920 --> 02:50:32,840
You open your arms to cast a spell when you fall.

2835
02:50:33,399 --> 02:50:35,959
The world rushes past you further than it should.

2836
02:50:35,959 --> 02:50:40,260
You hear a woman's voice singing gently above the sound of lapping waves.

2837
02:50:40,260 --> 02:50:50,600
What magic is this?

2838
02:50:50,600 --> 02:50:53,319
Back in Shumantati Hills.

2839
02:50:54,760 --> 02:50:59,610
Waves lull and wash towards the shore.

2840
02:50:59,610 --> 02:51:01,860
Lapping water.

2841
02:51:01,860 --> 02:51:03,780
You lie on a bed of stones.

2842
02:51:04,040 --> 02:51:07,799
Looking up at the bright sunlight.

2843
02:51:07,799 --> 02:51:09,370
Where am I?

2844
02:51:09,370 --> 02:51:11,049
This is not high salmon.

2845
02:51:11,049 --> 02:51:13,350
A feeling of dread creeps over you.

2846
02:51:13,350 --> 02:51:14,870
What kind of trap is this?

2847
02:51:14,870 --> 02:51:16,229
How far have you traveled?

2848
02:51:16,229 --> 02:51:22,500
You open your arms to gather the stars to you.

2849
02:51:22,500 --> 02:51:23,620
Stay your hand.

2850
02:51:23,620 --> 02:51:28,500
You will not need protection here.

2851
02:51:28,500 --> 02:51:29,700
Look for the speaker.

2852
02:51:29,700 --> 02:51:38,790
You turn this way and that looking for the speaker but seeing nothing but the washing water and spray.

2853
02:51:38,790 --> 02:51:40,440
Who are you?

2854
02:51:40,440 --> 02:51:42,069
You call.

2855
02:51:42,069 --> 02:51:46,170
I have many names but none truly describe who I am.

2856
02:51:46,170 --> 02:51:49,899
The sea washes at your boots as though inviting you to step forward.

2857
02:51:53,129 --> 02:51:54,010
Am I dreaming?

2858
02:51:54,010 --> 02:51:56,659
A gentle wind tugs at your coat.

2859
02:51:56,659 --> 02:51:59,219
As you shiver, you realize this is no dream.

2860
02:51:59,219 --> 02:52:02,180
You are standing on the shore of the Kakabad Sea.

2861
02:52:02,180 --> 02:52:04,420
Barely half days walk from Analand.

2862
02:52:04,420 --> 02:52:10,780
This is my hometown right here.

2863
02:52:10,780 --> 02:52:16,010
This is where I came from.

2864
02:52:16,010 --> 02:52:21,129
This is part one.

2865
02:52:21,129 --> 02:52:23,690
Those of you that are curious, this is sorcery one.

2866
02:52:23,690 --> 02:52:31,100
So we're back here.

2867
02:52:31,100 --> 02:52:32,620
You crunch towards the shore.

2868
02:52:32,620 --> 02:52:35,899
In the glinting water, a boat slowly rocks to and fro.

2869
02:52:35,899 --> 02:52:41,219
And in the boat sits a woman with a loom.

2870
02:52:41,219 --> 02:52:42,739
Why did you bring me here?

2871
02:52:42,739 --> 02:52:44,620
You ask.

2872
02:52:44,620 --> 02:52:46,780
We have walked a long road together.

2873
02:52:46,780 --> 02:52:48,659
Perhaps you do not know it.

2874
02:52:48,659 --> 02:52:51,059
But that road is almost at its end.

2875
02:52:51,059 --> 02:52:54,459
I bring you here to deliver a warning.

2876
02:52:54,459 --> 02:52:57,020
I am Libra, goddess of justice.

2877
02:52:57,020 --> 02:53:01,620
And our long road together has almost reached its end.

2878
02:53:01,620 --> 02:53:03,700
I have kept you safe many times.

2879
02:53:03,700 --> 02:53:04,500
Saved you.

2880
02:53:04,500 --> 02:53:11,100
But I can do no more.

2881
02:53:11,100 --> 02:53:12,540
We have never met.

2882
02:53:12,540 --> 02:53:14,219
You have never aided me.

2883
02:53:14,219 --> 02:53:16,889
You reply.

2884
02:53:16,889 --> 02:53:19,979
You do not understand.

2885
02:53:19,979 --> 02:53:21,700
But you will soon enough.

2886
02:53:21,700 --> 02:53:26,020
When you enter Mampang, you will understand.

2887
02:53:26,020 --> 02:53:30,100
The walls around that citadel are more than those of physical stone.

2888
02:53:30,100 --> 02:53:31,540
It is a cursed place.

2889
02:53:31,540 --> 02:53:36,010
Guarded by sigils and long knives.

2890
02:53:36,010 --> 02:53:37,770
I don't- I don't- I don't know.

2891
02:53:37,770 --> 02:53:38,409
I don't-

2892
02:53:38,409 --> 02:53:40,440
I will explain, Anor Lander.

2893
02:53:40,440 --> 02:53:44,020
For as long as you have walked, I have walked beside you.

2894
02:53:44,020 --> 02:53:46,360
I have granted you waking dreams.

2895
02:53:46,360 --> 02:53:47,319
Dreams of your future.

2896
02:53:47,319 --> 02:53:54,469
Dreams from which you wake to walk a different way.

2897
02:53:54,469 --> 02:53:54,969
I-

2898
02:53:57,700 --> 02:53:58,899
Waking dreams.

2899
02:53:58,899 --> 02:54:01,899
The kind that seem real.

2900
02:54:10,200 --> 02:54:11,079
Reset, reset.

2901
02:54:11,079 --> 02:54:12,520
Let me take a new take, new take.

2902
02:54:12,520 --> 02:54:15,959
Take two, take two.

2903
02:54:15,959 --> 02:54:17,590
Waking dreams.

2904
02:54:17,590 --> 02:54:18,870
The goddess continues.

2905
02:54:18,870 --> 02:54:22,780
The kind that seem real.

2906
02:54:22,780 --> 02:54:26,940
Until they disappear as though they had never been.

2907
02:54:26,940 --> 02:54:30,569
She shoots the shuttle across her loom once more.

2908
02:54:30,569 --> 02:54:31,850
But no more.

2909
02:54:31,850 --> 02:54:35,370
Once inside the walls of Mampang, your future will become precious once again.

2910
02:54:35,370 --> 02:54:39,159
The word strikes a knell of fear in your heart.

2911
02:54:39,159 --> 02:54:42,649
I- I- I-

2912
02:54:42,649 --> 02:54:45,500
I- I grow tired of riddles.

2913
02:54:45,500 --> 02:54:46,940
A weave can be made.

2914
02:54:46,940 --> 02:54:48,059
And then unmade.

2915
02:54:48,059 --> 02:54:50,219
And made again in different fashion.

2916
02:54:50,219 --> 02:54:54,459
The final garment does not know how many times it was stitched.

2917
02:54:54,459 --> 02:54:55,899
So it has been with your journey.

2918
02:55:00,010 --> 02:55:05,780
Or perhaps you consider yourself to be simply have been lucky to have survived so far.

2919
02:55:05,780 --> 02:55:09,459
A large wave strikes the shore.

2920
02:55:09,459 --> 02:55:13,530
And as it drains, the boat tilts and begins to drift away.

2921
02:55:13,530 --> 02:55:16,010
You realize although this woman is very intelligent.

2922
02:55:16,010 --> 02:55:17,129
And maybe a god.

2923
02:55:17,129 --> 02:55:21,420
She has a really, really strange off-putting laugh.

2924
02:55:21,420 --> 02:55:24,090
The woman makes no move to stop.

2925
02:55:24,090 --> 02:55:27,850
Merely continuing to weave.

2926
02:55:27,850 --> 02:55:28,350
Wait!

2927
02:55:28,729 --> 02:55:31,500
How can I leave this place?

2928
02:55:31,500 --> 02:55:32,000
Oh.

2929
02:55:32,860 --> 02:55:35,610
She's gone.

2930
02:55:35,610 --> 02:55:40,260
The thought of the long journey back to Mampang begins to sink into your mind.

2931
02:55:40,260 --> 02:55:42,549
I'm going to the cave.

2932
02:55:42,549 --> 02:55:49,190
You step away from the water towards the mouth of a dim cave.

2933
02:55:49,190 --> 02:55:52,200
Inside, the stone drips salty tears.

2934
02:55:52,200 --> 02:55:59,340
These tunnels must be flooded at high tide.

2935
02:55:59,340 --> 02:56:03,579
Gideon Ophnir, the all-knowing, is just Santa from the Christmas M&M's commercial.

2936
02:56:03,579 --> 02:56:08,020
I don't get it.

2937
02:56:08,020 --> 02:56:11,639
I don't get it.

2938
02:56:11,639 --> 02:56:13,639
Okay, let's, uh, look around the cave.

2939
02:56:13,639 --> 02:56:19,049
The cave walls are jagged and irregular.

2940
02:56:19,049 --> 02:56:23,030
Formed by lashing waves and shifting rocks of a thousand years.

2941
02:56:23,030 --> 02:56:26,629
Here and there, crystal seams wink from deep within the frozen stone folds.

2942
02:56:26,629 --> 02:56:29,270
Go deeper.

2943
02:56:29,270 --> 02:56:32,709
You push deeper into the cave, climbing over fallen stones.

2944
02:56:32,709 --> 02:56:33,350
I'm so sorry.

2945
02:56:33,350 --> 02:56:35,909
There's one person in chat that's gonna make me redo this line like five times

2946
02:56:35,909 --> 02:56:37,030
until I get it the way that they want it.

2947
02:56:37,030 --> 02:56:39,379
So I'm gonna just get in front of this.

2948
02:56:39,379 --> 02:56:46,069
You push deeper into the cave, climbing over fallen stones.

2949
02:56:46,069 --> 02:56:46,709
Stones.

2950
02:56:46,709 --> 02:56:50,969
Follow the line of the deepest darkness up into the towering cliffside.

2951
02:56:50,969 --> 02:56:54,090
Somewhere overhead are the low hills around Kantapani.

2952
02:56:54,090 --> 02:56:56,569
And a short distance from that is where your home is.

2953
02:56:56,569 --> 02:56:59,139
You climb higher still, upwards into the rock.

2954
02:56:59,459 --> 02:57:01,620
Something in the distance begins to roar and moan.

2955
02:57:01,620 --> 02:57:03,829
You are not alone in the darkness.

2956
02:57:03,829 --> 02:57:09,989
You can't cast any spells here.

2957
02:57:09,989 --> 02:57:14,899
You open your arms to cast a spell as a great wind begins to rush through the tunnel.

2958
02:57:14,899 --> 02:57:17,860
Gathering in strength and force as it tries to push you back.

2959
02:57:17,860 --> 02:57:22,459
Your arms are pushed apart and their power unbinds before it can form.

2960
02:57:22,459 --> 02:57:24,549
You are falling.

2961
02:57:24,549 --> 02:57:27,270
As you begin to fall, the stars reach down to catch you.

2962
02:57:35,750 --> 02:57:38,360
You are back on the edge of the pass.

2963
02:57:38,360 --> 02:57:39,559
Was that real?

2964
02:57:39,559 --> 02:57:43,479
A taste in my mouth.

2965
02:57:43,479 --> 02:57:46,120
There is a taste of salt in your mouth.

2966
02:57:46,120 --> 02:57:47,450
But nothing more.

2967
02:57:47,450 --> 02:57:50,569
You shake the vision away and look around yourself once more.

2968
02:57:50,569 --> 02:57:54,809
I'm going to rest.

2969
02:57:54,809 --> 02:57:59,379
Looking at the pass ahead, it would be best to try and cross under cover of darkness.

2970
02:57:59,379 --> 02:58:00,899
You settle down to wait.

2971
02:58:00,899 --> 02:58:04,579
The sun disappears behind the tall mountains and a few stars appear between the peaks.

2972
02:58:09,899 --> 02:58:14,889
Okay.

2973
02:58:14,889 --> 02:58:15,850
You get to your feet once more.

2974
02:58:15,850 --> 02:58:16,809
Night has settled around you.

2975
02:58:16,809 --> 02:58:19,209
You creep forwards into the narrow rock pass.

2976
02:58:19,209 --> 02:58:21,879
This is the only corridor to Mampang.

2977
02:58:21,879 --> 02:58:28,309
There is no other way into the pass.

2978
02:58:28,309 --> 02:58:31,770
You ever seen Arrested Development?

2979
02:58:31,770 --> 02:58:32,270
Yeah.

2980
02:58:32,809 --> 02:58:33,770
Long time ago.

2981
02:58:33,930 --> 02:58:34,969
I thought it was good.

2982
02:58:34,969 --> 02:58:37,659
I liked it a lot.

2983
02:58:37,659 --> 02:58:41,420
They did that like 10 years later season, right?

2984
02:58:41,979 --> 02:58:43,719
I thought that was all right.

2985
02:58:43,719 --> 02:58:45,399
I prefer the original, obviously.

2986
02:58:45,399 --> 02:58:49,110
I think everybody probably does.

2987
02:58:49,110 --> 02:58:52,149
You make your way slowly forward as the narrow walls close in on either side.

2988
02:58:52,149 --> 02:58:53,430
The sun disappears.

2989
02:58:53,430 --> 02:58:58,649
Okay.

2990
02:58:59,750 --> 02:59:00,250
Look ahead.

2991
02:59:04,870 --> 02:59:07,989
In the darkness, you can make out little but the slight curve of the road

2992
02:59:08,629 --> 02:59:11,670
and the mountain slopes that cut out the sky on either side.

2993
02:59:13,610 --> 02:59:14,329
Stop and listen.

2994
02:59:15,770 --> 02:59:17,690
You still your breath and listen for any movement

2995
02:59:17,690 --> 02:59:19,690
but only hear the wind whistling through the pass.

2996
02:59:20,489 --> 02:59:21,940
I'm going to climb the rocks.

2997
02:59:24,250 --> 02:59:27,530
You grasp the rocks and try to climb but it is too tiring.

2998
02:59:27,530 --> 02:59:32,299
You only manage to climb up a few feet before slipping back down.

2999
02:59:32,299 --> 02:59:33,180
The pass lies open.

3000
02:59:33,180 --> 02:59:36,459
There are no obvious traps and there are no ways around.

3001
02:59:36,459 --> 02:59:39,309
Okay.

3002
02:59:42,760 --> 02:59:44,440
The only way is forwards.

3003
02:59:45,159 --> 02:59:47,159
You move cautiously along the shadowy pass.

3004
02:59:47,799 --> 02:59:50,840
It is barely wide enough for two horses to ride

3005
02:59:50,840 --> 02:59:53,540
but the walls on either side loom high and threatening.

3006
02:59:54,340 --> 02:59:56,100
Starlight pools around you.

3007
02:59:56,100 --> 02:59:57,459
There is magic here.

3008
02:59:57,459 --> 02:59:59,850
Peer upwards.

3009
02:59:59,850 --> 03:00:02,489
Looking upwards, you see the cliff edges look smoother somehow

3010
03:00:02,489 --> 03:00:05,129
as the loose rocks have been moved away from the cliff edge.

3011
03:00:05,690 --> 03:00:09,260
What can I do here?

3012
03:00:10,780 --> 03:00:19,239
Hey, can you give me some motivation to start my programming homework?

3013
03:00:19,239 --> 03:00:21,819
Yeah, go do it.

3014
03:00:24,860 --> 03:00:26,940
All right, I think we've solved that.

3015
03:00:26,940 --> 03:00:39,340
Somebody said that guy said that an hour ago.

3016
03:00:39,979 --> 03:00:42,360
Did I read that wrong?

3017
03:00:47,180 --> 03:00:48,540
Wait, can I just teleport?

3018
03:00:49,340 --> 03:00:51,399
I think I want to teleport into the castle.

3019
03:00:52,040 --> 03:00:59,420
All right, I'm either going to try teleporting or

3020
03:01:01,879 --> 03:01:02,600
that's cheating.

3021
03:01:03,559 --> 03:01:04,360
Is it though?

3022
03:01:04,360 --> 03:01:05,959
Does it make a smelly smell?

3023
03:01:05,959 --> 03:01:06,760
Yeah.

3024
03:01:06,760 --> 03:01:12,649
You grab your nose plugs and stick them into your nostrils before casting the spell.

3025
03:01:13,209 --> 03:01:17,819
A terrible odor begins to blossom from your sleeves in a choking cloud.

3026
03:01:17,819 --> 03:01:22,389
All it accomplishes though is filling up the pass with a noxious stench.

3027
03:01:22,389 --> 03:01:27,450
No guards tumble from high perches coughing and choking.

3028
03:01:27,450 --> 03:01:29,209
Well, I definitely can do that up there.

3029
03:01:29,209 --> 03:01:31,639
I'm going 100%.

3030
03:01:32,520 --> 03:01:38,139
I can do that in front of the gate.

3031
03:01:38,139 --> 03:01:38,860
You pass.

3032
03:01:38,860 --> 03:01:40,780
You pace silently along the narrow path.

3033
03:01:40,780 --> 03:01:44,090
Perhaps no one is expecting you after all.

3034
03:01:44,090 --> 03:01:47,049
I'm definitely going to do like a big like stinky move up here.

3035
03:01:47,610 --> 03:01:56,700
Can somebody please explain this starlight thing to me?

3036
03:01:56,700 --> 03:01:58,059
Just link me the wiki page.

3037
03:02:00,440 --> 03:02:01,879
I don't think there even is anything to even know.

3038
03:02:02,520 --> 03:02:06,860
The end of the pass is almost in sight.

3039
03:02:06,860 --> 03:02:08,299
It is very dark down here.

3040
03:02:08,299 --> 03:02:10,459
The night sky, a thin strip of blue above.

3041
03:02:11,100 --> 03:02:14,700
Glancing up, you see a dancing light a short distance ahead.

3042
03:02:14,700 --> 03:02:15,579
Guards.

3043
03:02:15,579 --> 03:02:19,260
They are above you staring down into the pass and the cliff tops.

3044
03:02:19,260 --> 03:02:23,100
A small fire crackles behind them, but the light does not reach the bottom of the pass.

3045
03:02:23,659 --> 03:02:26,920
Okay, sneak forward.

3046
03:02:28,170 --> 03:02:30,809
You crouch in the heavy nighttime shadows and sneak along.

3047
03:02:31,370 --> 03:02:34,329
A lone guard stands above but does not see you.

3048
03:02:34,969 --> 03:02:38,469
You leave the guards behind as you reach the end of the pass.

3049
03:02:38,469 --> 03:02:40,309
Oh, coming here at night I think solves this problem.

3050
03:02:43,049 --> 03:02:44,809
You follow the path between sharp peaks.

3051
03:02:44,809 --> 03:02:46,329
Moonlight covers everything.

3052
03:02:46,329 --> 03:02:52,409
And then the pass opens and provides you with your first clear view of the Citadel's gate.

3053
03:02:52,409 --> 03:02:57,219
After 33 days of walking and hardship, you have arrived.

3054
03:02:58,700 --> 03:03:03,690
Mampang.

3055
03:03:03,690 --> 03:03:04,250
There it is.

3056
03:03:06,309 --> 03:03:06,809
Bones.

3057
03:03:07,350 --> 03:03:07,829
Rocks.

3058
03:03:07,829 --> 03:03:08,329
Stones.

3059
03:03:09,610 --> 03:03:10,110
Death.

3060
03:03:10,729 --> 03:03:11,450
Dried blood.

3061
03:03:12,170 --> 03:03:12,670
Spirits.

3062
03:03:14,760 --> 03:03:15,799
Echoing wails.

3063
03:03:15,799 --> 03:03:16,299
Agony.

3064
03:03:18,180 --> 03:03:20,440
Good luck.

3065
03:03:20,440 --> 03:03:23,450
The dread Citadel seems to be at peace.

3066
03:03:23,450 --> 03:03:26,889
There are no patrols of birdmen, no marching guards on the walls.

3067
03:03:27,819 --> 03:03:30,059
They're not expecting your arrival in the least.

3068
03:03:30,780 --> 03:03:33,659
It seems you have covered your approach flawlessly.

3069
03:03:35,030 --> 03:03:37,750
Stars turn in the empty air above you.

3070
03:03:37,750 --> 03:03:40,069
Actually made it for the first time ever.

3071
03:03:40,069 --> 03:03:44,170
The first time ever playing this game.

3072
03:03:44,170 --> 03:03:45,850
Which I played through it at least three or four times.

3073
03:03:46,409 --> 03:03:47,450
Getting here without being...

3074
03:03:48,569 --> 03:03:52,010
Like they know I was coming every other time I played it.

3075
03:03:52,010 --> 03:03:54,860
So I have no idea what this even happens here.

3076
03:03:54,860 --> 03:03:57,719
Because last time I played it I didn't do this.

3077
03:03:57,719 --> 03:03:59,850
Before that I didn't do it either.

3078
03:03:59,850 --> 03:04:01,450
You have to kill all seven serpents.

3079
03:04:02,180 --> 03:04:11,100
And I think you have to do all the 100% Kare too, don't you?

3080
03:04:11,100 --> 03:04:13,260
Um, maybe I should just sleep here.

3081
03:04:13,819 --> 03:04:14,459
Is that a stupid move?

3082
03:04:15,100 --> 03:04:19,079
Because I need health.

3083
03:04:21,450 --> 03:04:24,409
Although if I wake up in the morning I can't really sneak around though.

3084
03:04:24,409 --> 03:04:24,809
Hold on.

3085
03:04:31,079 --> 03:04:33,340
Mmm, I'm just gonna do it.

3086
03:04:35,459 --> 03:04:37,940
All right, this seems to be nothing but to do but wait.

3087
03:04:37,940 --> 03:04:40,579
You find a corner of the road and settle down to sleep.

3088
03:04:40,579 --> 03:04:42,500
Laying your pack down you try to rest despite the wind.

3089
03:04:43,139 --> 03:04:44,979
You do not need to eat anymore today.

3090
03:04:44,979 --> 03:04:47,450
You get comfortable and rest.

3091
03:04:48,780 --> 03:04:52,620
All right, so a Libra apparently was telling us.

3092
03:04:52,620 --> 03:04:54,620
Like, I am in your dreams, right?

3093
03:04:54,620 --> 03:04:57,719
The remainder of the night is kept busy with vivid dreams.

3094
03:04:58,360 --> 03:05:01,340
You are curled up on a bed of straw and bones.

3095
03:05:01,340 --> 03:05:05,260
A bird maid is carefully plucking grit from your skin.

3096
03:05:05,819 --> 03:05:08,459
And nuzzling you with its cruel hooked beak.

3097
03:05:09,379 --> 03:05:11,540
You are safe, warm.

3098
03:05:11,540 --> 03:05:14,020
She feeds you with still living rabbit.

3099
03:05:14,020 --> 03:05:17,020
A pair of rich black eyes are fixed on you.

3100
03:05:17,020 --> 03:05:19,020
A figure in shadow purrs your name.

3101
03:05:19,579 --> 03:05:22,459
The voice is rich, beautiful, and compelling.

3102
03:05:22,459 --> 03:05:26,329
Aliana or Flanker?

3103
03:05:26,329 --> 03:05:29,370
Flanker?

3104
03:05:31,270 --> 03:05:32,229
I am here for you.

3105
03:05:32,950 --> 03:05:34,069
I will take your hand.

3106
03:05:35,159 --> 03:05:36,920
Flanker murmurs softly in return.

3107
03:05:37,799 --> 03:05:41,319
And all the while you hear distant laughter from the east.

3108
03:05:46,360 --> 03:05:50,680
You ate some provisions, met Libra, the goddess of justice, and the long peace.

3109
03:05:51,670 --> 03:05:53,670
The archmage remains unaware of you.

3110
03:05:58,659 --> 03:06:03,299
You wake to the rumble of cartwheels along the road and pick yourself to your feet.

3111
03:06:03,299 --> 03:06:06,170
The wide gates are open but surrounded by guards.

3112
03:06:06,170 --> 03:06:09,059
Scores of merchants cluster around the end of the road.

3113
03:06:09,059 --> 03:06:10,889
People.

3114
03:06:10,889 --> 03:06:11,770
People!

3115
03:06:11,770 --> 03:06:15,110
You take a moment to drink in the sight.

3116
03:06:15,110 --> 03:06:18,709
Manpang's walls are towering and they march away on either side.

3117
03:06:18,709 --> 03:06:21,430
Guard turrets jutting against the dark blue sky.

3118
03:06:21,430 --> 03:06:23,750
The fortress is the size of a small city.

3119
03:06:23,750 --> 03:06:27,780
And somewhere inside is the crown of kings.

3120
03:06:27,780 --> 03:06:29,059
Look for ways in.

3121
03:06:29,059 --> 03:06:30,819
You scan the area for entry points.

3122
03:06:30,819 --> 03:06:32,059
The main gate.

3123
03:06:32,059 --> 03:06:33,020
The side entrance.

3124
03:06:33,020 --> 03:06:33,579
The road.

3125
03:06:34,629 --> 03:06:38,200
The main gate.

3126
03:06:38,200 --> 03:06:41,399
A short, well-paved road leads right up to the main gate.

3127
03:06:41,399 --> 03:06:45,379
It is bound in strips of iron and taller than most trees.

3128
03:06:45,379 --> 03:06:47,139
Carts approach the gate in orderly fashion.

3129
03:06:47,139 --> 03:06:49,700
Most are searched, emptied, and turn quickly around.

3130
03:06:49,700 --> 03:06:51,700
A few are allowed into the yard.

3131
03:06:51,700 --> 03:06:55,450
Guards armed with bows stand ready to cut down any unwelcome visitors.

3132
03:06:55,450 --> 03:06:58,649
The side entrance.

3133
03:06:58,649 --> 03:07:02,969
Following the wall with your eyes, you see a path following the stone wall of the keep westwards.

3134
03:07:02,969 --> 03:07:05,100
There may be another entrance that way.

3135
03:07:05,100 --> 03:07:07,299
Or the road.

3136
03:07:07,299 --> 03:07:12,340
Finally away to the east, the road from the gate disappears off towards distant lands.

3137
03:07:12,340 --> 03:07:15,829
Heading that way would mean leaving the citadel behind.

3138
03:07:15,829 --> 03:07:17,430
Time to make your choice.

3139
03:07:17,430 --> 03:07:20,469
Watch the carts.

3140
03:07:20,469 --> 03:07:26,280
Did I do- I feel like I may have done this last time.

3141
03:07:26,280 --> 03:07:27,639
You watch the carts carefully.

3142
03:07:27,639 --> 03:07:28,920
Each is laden with goods.

3143
03:07:28,920 --> 03:07:32,969
The guards inspect them fairly curiously, patting down their contents.

3144
03:07:32,969 --> 03:07:34,680
Contents?

3145
03:07:34,680 --> 03:07:35,479
Contents.

3146
03:07:35,479 --> 03:07:37,079
Before waving them through.

3147
03:07:37,079 --> 03:07:39,909
Their contents.

3148
03:07:39,909 --> 03:07:43,989
Alright, am I hiding in a cart or are we going somewhere else?

3149
03:07:43,989 --> 03:07:45,430
It's time for a poll.

3150
03:07:45,430 --> 03:07:50,010
It's time for a poll.

3151
03:07:50,010 --> 03:07:52,090
Hide in cart or make a move.

3152
03:07:52,090 --> 03:07:56,020
Because after we pick one of these, I think we're stuck with it.

3153
03:07:56,020 --> 03:08:02,739
And while you figure that out, I'm going to drink some more of my delicious drink.

3154
03:08:10,649 --> 03:08:18,840
Did you eat the BLT already?

3155
03:08:18,840 --> 03:08:29,610
Yes, I did.

3156
03:08:29,610 --> 03:08:30,649
Eat another one.

3157
03:08:30,649 --> 03:08:37,059
Are you drinking Abyssinth?

3158
03:08:37,059 --> 03:08:40,950
No.

3159
03:08:40,950 --> 03:08:46,379
Why would you just automatically go to Absinthe of all the drinks in the world?

3160
03:08:46,379 --> 03:08:51,450
Oh, let me get a nice sip of my- of my nice beverage.

3161
03:08:51,450 --> 03:08:57,739
Is it Absinthe?

3162
03:08:57,739 --> 03:09:02,840
Anytime I've ever heard of Absinthe and seen what it looks like, I always feel like it's

3163
03:09:02,840 --> 03:09:13,290
some weird magical potion from like the 1400s.

3164
03:09:13,290 --> 03:09:16,680
Alright, looks like we're hiding in the cart.

3165
03:09:16,680 --> 03:09:17,799
It kind of is.

3166
03:09:17,799 --> 03:09:20,459
Because it is.

3167
03:09:20,459 --> 03:09:25,180
Yeah, Absinthe just looks like it belongs in Skyrim or something.

3168
03:09:25,180 --> 03:09:31,190
Okay, let's hide in the cart.

3169
03:09:31,190 --> 03:09:36,149
You fall in behind a merchant's cart and unnoticed flip up the tarpaulin that covers

3170
03:09:36,149 --> 03:09:36,950
the back.

3171
03:09:36,950 --> 03:09:38,969
You have plenty of time to jump inside.

3172
03:09:38,969 --> 03:09:44,180
The guards are quizzing each merchant and examining their stock as they reach the gate.

3173
03:09:44,180 --> 03:09:45,690
Jump in.

3174
03:09:45,690 --> 03:09:48,090
There is a crunch as you settle down inside.

3175
03:09:48,649 --> 03:09:50,809
You've sat on a group of very large eggs.

3176
03:09:51,370 --> 03:09:53,370
In fact, the whole cart is full of them.

3177
03:09:53,370 --> 03:09:55,620
The cart rumbles forward.

3178
03:09:55,620 --> 03:09:57,690
Uh-oh.

3179
03:09:57,690 --> 03:10:03,479
The cart rumbles slowly down the rough road.

3180
03:10:03,479 --> 03:10:04,520
Just cast a spell.

3181
03:10:06,600 --> 03:10:07,559
Alright, what can I do in here?

3182
03:10:10,790 --> 03:10:13,690
Uh, sap?

3183
03:10:13,690 --> 03:10:16,569
I could cause depression to, what, the driver?

3184
03:10:18,180 --> 03:10:20,180
Oh, I can make a smelly smell.

3185
03:10:24,950 --> 03:10:30,219
Uh, what is this?

3186
03:10:30,219 --> 03:10:32,139
Oh, summon a giant.

3187
03:10:35,940 --> 03:10:36,979
Will they know it's me, though?

3188
03:10:36,979 --> 03:10:40,579
If I summon a giant and just say, hey, just like jump over the fucking fence or whatever

3189
03:10:40,579 --> 03:10:40,819
it is.

3190
03:10:40,819 --> 03:10:41,700
Jump over the gate.

3191
03:10:45,510 --> 03:10:46,950
Okay, hold on.

3192
03:10:48,540 --> 03:10:50,700
We might need another vote because this is kind of important.

3193
03:10:54,149 --> 03:10:54,950
Horse field.

3194
03:10:58,729 --> 03:11:00,329
Alright, are we going to?

3195
03:11:02,729 --> 03:11:07,450
Okay, it's either depression, smelly.

3196
03:11:10,520 --> 03:11:12,360
I can make the cart faster.

3197
03:11:12,360 --> 03:11:13,159
What would even happen?

3198
03:11:13,159 --> 03:11:14,280
Would we just barrel through?

3199
03:11:15,159 --> 03:11:15,959
Alright, smell.

3200
03:11:17,350 --> 03:11:19,670
Uh, what was the last one?

3201
03:11:19,670 --> 03:11:20,389
Oh, okay.

3202
03:11:20,389 --> 03:11:24,979
Giant, smell, or what was the first one?

3203
03:11:25,540 --> 03:11:26,020
Depression.

3204
03:11:27,670 --> 03:11:29,430
Smelly, giant, depression.

3205
03:11:32,709 --> 03:11:35,430
Giant, smelly, depression.

3206
03:11:36,309 --> 03:11:36,790
Which one?

3207
03:11:58,420 --> 03:12:02,260
Yeah, saying it together sounds kind of weird, right?

3208
03:12:02,819 --> 03:12:04,180
Alright, it's going to be smelly.

3209
03:12:04,180 --> 03:12:05,379
Smelly is winning by so much.

3210
03:12:06,940 --> 03:12:08,059
Alright, let's do it.

3211
03:12:08,059 --> 03:12:08,780
There's no way.

3212
03:12:08,780 --> 03:12:10,860
There's like hundreds more.

3213
03:12:21,020 --> 03:12:23,979
Rose, I don't think the sorcery council is going to be pleased anymore.

3214
03:12:27,829 --> 03:12:28,549
Alright, let's do it.

3215
03:12:33,110 --> 03:12:36,389
I've not really had nose plugs in any of my playthroughs either, so this is kind of fun.

3216
03:12:36,389 --> 03:12:36,709
Let's see.

3217
03:12:37,510 --> 03:12:41,540
You grab your nose plugs and stick them into your nostrils before casting the spell.

3218
03:12:42,020 --> 03:12:45,299
A terrible odor begins to blossom from your sleeves in a choking cloud.

3219
03:12:46,180 --> 03:12:50,579
The cloud of stench stays trapped under the tarpaulin.

3220
03:12:50,579 --> 03:12:51,540
Your trap is set.

3221
03:12:51,540 --> 03:12:52,260
Now you wait.

3222
03:12:52,260 --> 03:12:55,659
Wait, I just, I just, oh no, that's not good.

3223
03:13:04,010 --> 03:13:05,209
It's underneath me.

3224
03:13:05,209 --> 03:13:06,409
I've got it trapped with me.

3225
03:13:10,569 --> 03:13:13,290
The cart trundles forward, then stops again.

3226
03:13:13,290 --> 03:13:15,209
You hear a guard's boots crunching near.

3227
03:13:15,850 --> 03:13:16,950
What have you got?

3228
03:13:17,989 --> 03:13:19,350
The merchant's voice is reedy.

3229
03:13:20,149 --> 03:13:22,149
Basilisk eggs, sir.

3230
03:13:22,149 --> 03:13:24,229
For the archmage's table, I am told.

3231
03:13:26,200 --> 03:13:26,520
Wait.

3232
03:13:27,319 --> 03:13:31,079
You wait in your stench-filled cart, with literally bated breath.

3233
03:13:31,639 --> 03:13:32,649
Is that so?

3234
03:13:33,450 --> 03:13:34,649
Let me have a look.

3235
03:13:34,649 --> 03:13:40,979
Corner of the tarpaulin flips, letting in a little light, and letting out the smell.

3236
03:13:40,979 --> 03:13:44,629
The guard staggers back, coughing and choking.

3237
03:13:44,629 --> 03:13:45,110
What by-

3238
03:13:45,670 --> 03:13:46,309
Greeds!

3239
03:13:46,309 --> 03:13:46,790
Nipples!

3240
03:13:49,299 --> 03:13:50,579
Basilisk eggs!

3241
03:13:51,219 --> 03:13:54,440
The merchant replies, as if talking to a child.

3242
03:13:54,440 --> 03:13:59,670
They smell terrible when they go bad.

3243
03:13:59,670 --> 03:14:02,420
Uh, I'm gonna wait.

3244
03:14:02,420 --> 03:14:04,260
You wait, intense silence.

3245
03:14:05,190 --> 03:14:05,670
Fine.

3246
03:14:07,430 --> 03:14:08,469
Get on with ya.

3247
03:14:08,469 --> 03:14:10,629
But don't open that tap again.

3248
03:14:10,629 --> 03:14:16,090
The cart rattles forward, to the gate of Mampang, and then inside.

3249
03:14:18,569 --> 03:14:19,770
Yeah, we did it.

3250
03:14:19,770 --> 03:14:20,969
Didn't alert anything.

3251
03:14:20,969 --> 03:14:22,409
Finally, for the first time ever.

3252
03:14:22,969 --> 03:14:28,840
There's a thundering echo for a moment as the cart passes through the tight doorway.

3253
03:14:28,840 --> 03:14:33,219
Then it emerges into the relative quiet of the Mampang's main yard.

3254
03:14:33,219 --> 03:14:34,899
You slip out of the cart into the yard.

3255
03:14:34,899 --> 03:14:38,180
I can't believe that worked.

3256
03:14:38,180 --> 03:14:42,790
The shadow of Mampang falls over you like a cloak.

3257
03:14:42,790 --> 03:14:48,229
It is as though the sun itself has dimmed, and you feel suddenly more cold and alone

3258
03:14:48,229 --> 03:14:49,579
than ever before.

3259
03:14:49,579 --> 03:14:54,729
But you have no choice but to continue.

3260
03:14:54,729 --> 03:14:57,049
A voice in your head whispers,

3261
03:14:57,049 --> 03:14:58,280
Good luck.

3262
03:14:58,280 --> 03:15:01,379
Before fading into the murmur of waves.

3263
03:15:01,379 --> 03:15:03,139
You've entered the citadel of Mampang.

3264
03:15:03,700 --> 03:15:10,809
Here, no decision can be rewound.

3265
03:15:10,809 --> 03:15:11,309
Uh oh.

3266
03:15:15,579 --> 03:15:16,079
Jesus!

3267
03:15:22,219 --> 03:15:23,420
That was really loud.

3268
03:15:24,780 --> 03:15:29,709
I forgot it happens, like, right there, too.

3269
03:15:29,709 --> 03:15:32,510
The early morning sun makes the air glow.

3270
03:15:32,510 --> 03:15:34,350
It is immediately clear.

3271
03:15:34,350 --> 03:15:36,969
This was once a grand entranceway.

3272
03:15:36,969 --> 03:15:41,870
The remains of tall statues, like those on the southern shore of Lake...

3273
03:15:41,870 --> 03:15:43,229
You know the one.

3274
03:15:43,229 --> 03:15:44,989
Line the road on either side.

3275
03:15:44,989 --> 03:15:51,149
But their welcoming expressions have worn smooth, and their bodies have sheared.

3276
03:15:51,149 --> 03:15:52,569
Count the statues.

3277
03:15:52,569 --> 03:15:56,329
There are four statues on one side of the path, and four on the other.

3278
03:15:56,329 --> 03:15:56,889
Eight.

3279
03:15:56,889 --> 03:15:59,180
Look at them.

3280
03:15:59,180 --> 03:16:01,739
Each stands, or stood, twice your height,

3281
03:16:01,739 --> 03:16:05,719
and their arms are all outstretched at different angles and orientations.

3282
03:16:05,719 --> 03:16:08,440
They're clearly in the act of crafting magic.

3283
03:16:08,440 --> 03:16:15,069
But which spell is each casting is all but impossible to tell.

3284
03:16:15,069 --> 03:16:17,709
Many have lost their arms, and many more of their fingers,

3285
03:16:17,709 --> 03:16:21,790
and most of their pursed, whispering mouths have crumbled to powder.

3286
03:16:21,790 --> 03:16:24,270
Approach a statue.

3287
03:16:24,270 --> 03:16:29,389
The statue nearest to the gate is reasonably intact.

3288
03:16:29,389 --> 03:16:34,540
Going over to it, you make out a portion of a ruined inscription at its base.

3289
03:16:34,540 --> 03:16:35,340
D.O.

3290
03:16:35,340 --> 03:16:40,590
The statue opposite also has a carving at its base.

3291
03:16:40,590 --> 03:16:43,389
Read the carving opposite.

3292
03:16:43,389 --> 03:16:50,329
You cross to the other side of the path and squat down, making out the letters O.T.

3293
03:16:50,329 --> 03:16:52,889
So they're countering each other?

3294
03:16:52,889 --> 03:16:59,389
So that's dock and hot?

3295
03:16:59,389 --> 03:17:02,840
I think we already knew that.

3296
03:17:02,840 --> 03:17:08,120
The next statue along from the gate is broken at the waist and carved with F.A. at its base.

3297
03:17:08,120 --> 03:17:11,840
Stands opposite another, whose carving reads O.K.

3298
03:17:15,579 --> 03:17:17,579
I think that's fall?

3299
03:17:17,579 --> 03:17:20,219
And then walk?

3300
03:17:20,219 --> 03:17:21,100
W.O.K.?

3301
03:17:21,100 --> 03:17:23,360
I think we already knew that too.

3302
03:17:27,930 --> 03:17:32,329
You search the other statues for any more readable carvings, but one is missing entirely.

3303
03:17:32,329 --> 03:17:34,809
Another two have been firmly destroyed,

3304
03:17:34,809 --> 03:17:39,280
leaving only the last statue in line which stands tall, arms raised upwards.

3305
03:17:39,280 --> 03:17:44,299
It holds a stone vial upended in one fist, and has a skull beneath its foot.

3306
03:17:44,299 --> 03:17:46,860
Look opposite.

3307
03:17:46,860 --> 03:17:50,729
Opposite the statue is nothing but an empty plinth.

3308
03:17:50,729 --> 03:17:55,000
Carved at its foot are three characters, overgrown with moss.

3309
03:17:55,000 --> 03:17:58,860
Clear the moss away.

3310
03:17:58,860 --> 03:18:08,219
You pull the clumps of moss free to reveal the name of the spell.

3311
03:18:08,219 --> 03:18:09,020
Z.

3312
03:18:09,020 --> 03:18:13,200
You cannot hold back a shiver.

3313
03:18:13,200 --> 03:18:16,840
This is truly the Fortress of Sorcerers.

3314
03:18:16,840 --> 03:18:24,959
A place where the weirdest spell of all is not hidden away, but displayed in the main yard.

3315
03:18:24,959 --> 03:18:28,000
Perhaps someone here even knows what this spell does.

3316
03:18:28,000 --> 03:18:30,840
You hurry away from the statues, feeling as though they are watching you.

3317
03:18:36,989 --> 03:18:40,059
The weirdest spell, yeah.

3318
03:18:40,059 --> 03:18:41,659
This is a weird spell.

3319
03:18:41,659 --> 03:18:44,000
The center of the yard.

3320
03:18:44,000 --> 03:18:49,469
You stride further into the bustling yard.

3321
03:18:49,469 --> 03:18:51,709
The air stirs a little, still cold but fresh.

3322
03:18:51,709 --> 03:18:54,700
The square is busy with traders and their porters,

3323
03:18:54,780 --> 03:18:57,500
carting goods from the gate to the high inner wall,

3324
03:18:57,500 --> 03:19:01,100
where a rack of pulleys and ropes is in constant operation.

3325
03:19:01,100 --> 03:19:05,209
Strangely, there is no door in the wall into the city.

3326
03:19:05,209 --> 03:19:10,010
That's weird.

3327
03:19:10,010 --> 03:19:12,969
Doors are set into the walls on either side of the yard.

3328
03:19:12,969 --> 03:19:15,690
The east-rich smells come from a noisy kitchen.

3329
03:19:15,690 --> 03:19:20,760
To the west are a series of rooms through which guards occasionally walk.

3330
03:19:20,760 --> 03:19:21,719
Watch the pulleys.

3331
03:19:21,719 --> 03:19:27,290
You watch the crews on top of the tall wall working the pulleys on top of the wall,

3332
03:19:27,290 --> 03:19:30,079
transferring goods into the city inside.

3333
03:19:30,079 --> 03:19:33,690
Perhaps there is a way to use them, but you cannot see one.

3334
03:19:33,690 --> 03:19:40,110
There are scores of people working on every rope and nowhere to hide.

3335
03:19:40,110 --> 03:19:40,989
News reporter.

3336
03:19:42,430 --> 03:19:43,790
All right, I'll do it as a news reporter.

3337
03:19:45,709 --> 03:19:47,309
Most of the merchants are stopped at the gate,

3338
03:19:47,309 --> 03:19:50,829
but a few are allowed to drive their carts all the way up to the far wall.

3339
03:19:50,829 --> 03:19:53,149
Here, their goods are unloaded, strapped to the ropes,

3340
03:19:53,149 --> 03:19:57,020
and hoisted over the wall, presumably into the citadel proper.

3341
03:19:57,020 --> 03:19:59,260
Gold coins are shuttled back again.

3342
03:19:59,260 --> 03:20:00,780
It seems remarkably elaborate.

3343
03:20:00,780 --> 03:20:04,489
Let's talk to a merchant.

3344
03:20:04,489 --> 03:20:06,409
You find a merchant waiting for a free rope.

3345
03:20:06,409 --> 03:20:09,209
He nods a cautious greeting as you come to stand beside him.

3346
03:20:09,209 --> 03:20:15,040
What are you trading?

3347
03:20:15,120 --> 03:20:15,760
Leather.

3348
03:20:15,760 --> 03:20:16,680
Skins.

3349
03:20:17,319 --> 03:20:18,639
Fibers.

3350
03:20:18,639 --> 03:20:21,120
It's a small enough trade, but it serves me well.

3351
03:20:21,120 --> 03:20:23,930
What are they used for?

3352
03:20:25,280 --> 03:20:25,840
Shoes.

3353
03:20:25,840 --> 03:20:27,280
Clothes, I suppose.

3354
03:20:27,280 --> 03:20:28,959
I don't rightly care.

3355
03:20:28,959 --> 03:20:33,610
Have you ever been inside Mampang?

3356
03:20:33,610 --> 03:20:38,190
You ask, watching the curious arrangement of pulleys and ropes.

3357
03:20:38,190 --> 03:20:39,149
Of course I haven't.

3358
03:20:40,829 --> 03:20:42,430
I'm still here, aren't I?

3359
03:20:42,430 --> 03:20:44,329
Are you new or something?

3360
03:20:44,329 --> 03:20:46,989
Of course not.

3361
03:20:46,989 --> 03:20:49,799
The merchant continues his puzzled stare.

3362
03:20:49,799 --> 03:20:52,040
It says nothing else.

3363
03:20:52,040 --> 03:20:54,120
He edges a fraction away from you.

3364
03:20:55,639 --> 03:20:59,319
Have you ever seen the-

3365
03:20:59,319 --> 03:21:00,840
Oh, I shouldn't have said that!

3366
03:21:00,840 --> 03:21:03,600
Have you ever seen the Archmage?

3367
03:21:03,600 --> 03:21:07,719
The merchant shakes his head and smiles.

3368
03:21:07,719 --> 03:21:14,680
No, but I'm told he walks around Mampang once a week in his robes of power and kills anyone who does not bow.

3369
03:21:14,680 --> 03:21:17,229
Eh, that's just what I heard.

3370
03:21:17,229 --> 03:21:21,559
A hook descends near the merchant and he nods farewell before settling about,

3371
03:21:21,559 --> 03:21:23,159
loading his crates onto the hook.

3372
03:21:23,159 --> 03:21:25,549
You need to find a way through.

3373
03:21:25,549 --> 03:21:29,930
Over or under the wall.

3374
03:21:29,930 --> 03:21:33,260
Uh, I need food, so I need to go into the kitchen.

3375
03:21:33,260 --> 03:21:40,120
You said the wrong words with the wrong voice.

3376
03:21:40,120 --> 03:21:49,239
Any opportunity I get to do like the- like the crabby British guy.

3377
03:21:49,239 --> 03:21:49,719
You know what I mean?

3378
03:21:49,719 --> 03:21:52,360
Like, oh, I'll do this one right here, I'll try to avoid it.

3379
03:21:52,360 --> 03:21:57,690
I- I- I'm gonna do it.

3380
03:21:57,690 --> 03:22:01,579
Opening the door a crack, you see a riot of activity and heat.

3381
03:22:01,579 --> 03:22:05,559
Goblins rush between fires and low tables.

3382
03:22:05,559 --> 03:22:10,600
Carrying heaps of food and pots of water, an enormous hobgoblin stands at the front of the room,

3383
03:22:10,600 --> 03:22:13,479
shouting orders and waving a cleaver above his head.

3384
03:22:13,479 --> 03:22:16,379
There might be some useful information to be overheard here.

3385
03:22:16,379 --> 03:22:18,909
Let's stride right in.

3386
03:22:19,420 --> 03:22:22,139
You swing open the door trying to look like you belong.

3387
03:22:22,139 --> 03:22:23,920
No one pays you any attention.

3388
03:22:23,920 --> 03:22:27,120
The large hobgoblin burps as he stirs the soup.

3389
03:22:28,440 --> 03:22:31,840
All right, we're gonna go talk to the hobgoblin.

3390
03:22:31,840 --> 03:22:37,149
You stroll right up to the hobgoblin by the stove.

3391
03:22:37,149 --> 03:22:47,680
The head chef- wait, let's look around here, this is cool.

3392
03:22:47,680 --> 03:22:50,170
The head chef looks up to glare at you.

3393
03:22:50,170 --> 03:22:54,430
You see the kitchen goblin's paws, waiting with bated breath.

3394
03:22:54,430 --> 03:23:00,639
Most have cleavers or knives or some kind and you are quite considerably outnumbered.

3395
03:23:00,639 --> 03:23:06,969
No one crawls in here without my permission.

3396
03:23:06,969 --> 03:23:14,590
So tell me fast, why shouldn't I put you in soup?

3397
03:23:14,590 --> 03:23:18,079
Uh, I need some food.

3398
03:23:18,079 --> 03:23:21,979
The chef waves his cleaver in your face.

3399
03:23:21,979 --> 03:23:25,420
And you think you'll just walk in here and ask for some?

3400
03:23:25,420 --> 03:23:31,000
Into the kitchen of Throg, the one who serves a thousand hungry gods a day?

3401
03:23:34,110 --> 03:23:35,069
Indeed.

3402
03:23:35,069 --> 03:23:40,920
At your calm reply, Throg explodes with fury.

3403
03:23:40,920 --> 03:23:45,799
He rants, calling you a philistine and bemoaning those who shackle his brilliance.

3404
03:23:45,799 --> 03:23:48,909
He's soon red and puffing with the effort.

3405
03:23:48,909 --> 03:23:51,479
No, I'm just gonna- yeah, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

3406
03:23:51,479 --> 03:23:55,149
You nod along to his raving, trying to plot your escape.

3407
03:23:55,149 --> 03:24:00,090
Oh, so you are the new assistant then.

3408
03:24:00,090 --> 03:24:02,280
Why didn't you say so?

3409
03:24:02,280 --> 03:24:04,200
You frown, puzzled.

3410
03:24:04,200 --> 03:24:07,600
You must have nodded at the wrong time.

3411
03:24:07,600 --> 03:24:08,559
Uh, not again.

3412
03:24:10,459 --> 03:24:12,639
Better to make soup than end up in it.

3413
03:24:12,639 --> 03:24:15,530
Throg is already turning around.

3414
03:24:15,530 --> 03:24:17,370
I see, philc.

3415
03:24:17,370 --> 03:24:19,739
She'll get you strolled.

3416
03:24:19,739 --> 03:24:21,100
With that, he turns away.

3417
03:24:21,100 --> 03:24:28,649
Should I just go in here?

3418
03:24:32,920 --> 03:24:33,979
Run.

3419
03:24:33,979 --> 03:24:37,500
Yeah, running I think would be the- a bad- remember, there's no rewinds.

3420
03:24:37,500 --> 03:24:41,770
So I- we can't really make more than one decision here.

3421
03:24:41,770 --> 03:24:43,309
No rewinding.

3422
03:24:43,309 --> 03:24:50,010
Walked.

3423
03:24:50,010 --> 03:24:51,049
Let's do this.

3424
03:24:51,049 --> 03:24:57,899
You make your way around to the counter to where the goblin Throg, pointed out,

3425
03:24:57,899 --> 03:25:01,180
is trying to lift a bag of potatoes that is almost her size.

3426
03:25:01,180 --> 03:25:05,639
She collapses under the weight, but scrambles out from under the bag when she sees you.

3427
03:25:05,639 --> 03:25:14,700
She is a gigantic- she is gigantic for a goblin, but still a head shorter than you.

3428
03:25:14,700 --> 03:25:18,879
Her apron is mostly stains, dirt, and a few threadbare ruffles.

3429
03:25:18,879 --> 03:25:24,170
I love all this- all this up here.

3430
03:25:24,170 --> 03:25:31,209
It's just this interesting texture on all of these illustrations.

3431
03:25:31,209 --> 03:25:33,069
I love it.

3432
03:25:33,069 --> 03:25:35,309
Okay, uh, help her up.

3433
03:25:35,309 --> 03:25:38,780
You reach down a hand and pull her up.

3434
03:25:38,780 --> 03:25:39,340
Philc!

3435
03:25:39,340 --> 03:25:43,739
She announces, and you realize with a sickening feeling that she is vainly trying to tidy the

3436
03:25:43,739 --> 03:25:47,340
thick mound of greasy hair on her head as she speaks.

3437
03:25:47,340 --> 03:25:51,069
Uh, hello.

3438
03:25:51,069 --> 03:25:55,280
You greet her and explain that you are the new assistant.

3439
03:25:55,280 --> 03:25:57,840
Philc is clearly impressed.

3440
03:25:57,840 --> 03:26:01,200
Finally, we have someone who can reach the top shelf.

3441
03:26:01,200 --> 03:26:05,920
But before you start, there are a few rules.

3442
03:26:05,920 --> 03:26:07,399
What rules?

3443
03:26:07,399 --> 03:26:09,479
First, never annoy Throg.

3444
03:26:10,040 --> 03:26:11,799
Second, don't drop anything.

3445
03:26:11,799 --> 03:26:13,639
Third, don't go on the ladder.

3446
03:26:13,639 --> 03:26:16,040
Throg is very paranoid about that.

3447
03:26:16,040 --> 03:26:20,120
He's convinced there are spies everywhere trying to steal his recipes.

3448
03:26:20,120 --> 03:26:23,399
Frankly, I'm surprised he didn't skin you the moment you walked in.

3449
03:26:23,399 --> 03:26:27,079
She blushes at some unknown thought.

3450
03:26:27,079 --> 03:26:31,930
Spies?

3451
03:26:31,930 --> 03:26:34,350
You ask with some interest.

3452
03:26:34,350 --> 03:26:36,270
Oh, I don't think they're real.

3453
03:26:36,270 --> 03:26:38,989
Who would steal old Thunderbowl's recipes?

3454
03:26:38,989 --> 03:26:41,229
He doesn't even use spices.

3455
03:26:41,229 --> 03:26:44,430
The Archmage is just as paranoid about spies as I am.

3456
03:26:44,430 --> 03:26:46,510
But at least he's got a reason to worry.

3457
03:26:46,510 --> 03:26:52,239
Philc looks at you sideways and then reaches out a tentative hand to touch yours.

3458
03:26:55,399 --> 03:26:58,040
He's trying really hard to make new voices.

3459
03:26:58,040 --> 03:27:01,520
All right, let her touch me.

3460
03:27:01,520 --> 03:27:07,040
You stay still and her cold, greasy goblin flesh settles on your arm.

3461
03:27:07,040 --> 03:27:08,959
I'm so glad you're here.

3462
03:27:08,959 --> 03:27:11,639
And we need to get this soup made.

3463
03:27:11,639 --> 03:27:13,239
Yes, we feed all the guards in the yards.

3464
03:27:13,239 --> 03:27:14,600
We're always busy.

3465
03:27:14,600 --> 03:27:16,280
You chop these vegetables and get it simmering.

3466
03:27:16,280 --> 03:27:18,440
I need to go grab some roach pig meat.

3467
03:27:18,440 --> 03:27:19,479
I'll be right back.

3468
03:27:19,479 --> 03:27:21,239
You can start the cooking, can't you?

3469
03:27:21,239 --> 03:27:22,270
She turns to go.

3470
03:27:25,879 --> 03:27:28,280
Of course.

3471
03:27:28,280 --> 03:27:31,159
Really nice to have an expert pair of hands around here.

3472
03:27:31,159 --> 03:27:34,250
She leaves you to your task.

3473
03:27:34,250 --> 03:27:37,930
Before you is a chopping board heaped with vegetables, onions, turnips, potatoes,

3474
03:27:37,930 --> 03:27:40,090
and a few purple orbs you don't recognize.

3475
03:27:40,090 --> 03:27:45,959
You will need a knife.

3476
03:27:45,959 --> 03:27:47,129
The knife rack.

3477
03:27:47,129 --> 03:27:51,100
Don't go into the ladder.

3478
03:27:51,100 --> 03:27:53,549
You go over to the knife rack and pull out a blade.

3479
03:27:53,549 --> 03:27:56,270
Two goblins across the kitchen are talking in low voices.

3480
03:27:56,270 --> 03:27:58,479
Look at me.

3481
03:27:58,479 --> 03:28:03,549
It's a bit of wood the guards prop against the tower window.

3482
03:28:05,229 --> 03:28:10,110
Test the knife blade.

3483
03:28:10,110 --> 03:28:12,079
You test the edge.

3484
03:28:12,079 --> 03:28:16,280
It is so dull you doubt it will cut butter.

3485
03:28:16,280 --> 03:28:20,479
If it's a bit of wood, how do you explain to bad men?

3486
03:28:20,479 --> 03:28:22,079
They're not natural.

3487
03:28:24,159 --> 03:28:25,120
Sharpen the knife.

3488
03:28:25,120 --> 03:28:27,079
There's a whetstone in the counter.

3489
03:28:27,079 --> 03:28:31,000
You drag the knife blade back and forth a few times until it is clean.

3490
03:28:31,000 --> 03:28:36,239
Okay, go back to the counter.

3491
03:28:36,239 --> 03:28:37,600
Then you head back over to the counter.

3492
03:28:37,600 --> 03:28:46,649
Phil steals a quick glance and flashes a crooked smile.

3493
03:28:46,649 --> 03:28:48,250
You examine the vegetables.

3494
03:28:48,250 --> 03:28:51,180
Several of them are rotten.

3495
03:28:51,180 --> 03:28:55,200
I'm told the bad men are breeding.

3496
03:28:55,200 --> 03:28:58,559
A third goblin hisses to the first two.

3497
03:28:58,559 --> 03:29:00,799
I heard they have a nest.

3498
03:29:03,799 --> 03:29:12,430
Chop them coarsely, finely, or throw out the rotten ones.

3499
03:29:12,430 --> 03:29:19,549
I think they want them in here.

3500
03:29:19,549 --> 03:29:20,190
It's a soup.

3501
03:29:20,190 --> 03:29:22,270
Yeah.

3502
03:29:22,270 --> 03:29:25,069
Throw out the rotten ones, but I feel like that guy's gonna come over and be like,

3503
03:29:26,270 --> 03:29:26,989
They're for good.

3504
03:29:28,110 --> 03:29:28,670
I don't know.

3505
03:29:28,670 --> 03:29:29,709
I think it was gonna...

3506
03:29:29,709 --> 03:29:31,149
I'm not gonna say anything.

3507
03:29:32,680 --> 03:29:38,239
You attack the pile carelessly, the polished blade sinking into some of the more rotten vegetables.

3508
03:29:38,239 --> 03:29:41,120
You end up with a haphazard pile of chunks and goop.

3509
03:29:41,120 --> 03:29:43,360
Milk walks past.

3510
03:29:43,360 --> 03:29:45,600
Carrying a tray of overbaked breads.

3511
03:29:45,600 --> 03:29:47,579
Stick them in a pot.

3512
03:29:47,579 --> 03:29:50,219
Once they boil, no one will care what they look like.

3513
03:29:50,219 --> 03:30:00,079
She offers a quick nervous smile, then is gone on another errand across the room.

3514
03:30:00,079 --> 03:30:03,020
Pots.

3515
03:30:03,020 --> 03:30:08,059
Next, you head over to the rack, where a random assortment of pots and pans hang from nasty

3516
03:30:08,059 --> 03:30:09,680
looking hooks.

3517
03:30:09,680 --> 03:30:15,319
Most are dented or cracked and have holes rusted in the bottom.

3518
03:30:15,319 --> 03:30:18,329
Don't be stupid.

3519
03:30:18,329 --> 03:30:20,409
Birdmen can't lay eggs.

3520
03:30:20,409 --> 03:30:23,159
Think how big they'd be.

3521
03:30:23,159 --> 03:30:25,079
We'd be using them to make our own...

3522
03:30:29,370 --> 03:30:30,809
This food sucks.

3523
03:30:32,030 --> 03:30:33,870
We should probably eat those.

3524
03:30:33,870 --> 03:30:35,950
We would make an omelet with them, wouldn't we?

3525
03:30:38,159 --> 03:30:38,959
Yeah.

3526
03:30:38,959 --> 03:30:41,719
Okay, take the rusty pot.

3527
03:30:41,719 --> 03:30:42,600
Take the dented pot.

3528
03:30:42,600 --> 03:30:43,559
Take a new pot.

3529
03:30:43,559 --> 03:30:49,709
This audiobook sucks.

3530
03:30:50,670 --> 03:30:51,469
Hey, well, guess what?

3531
03:30:51,469 --> 03:30:52,510
It's free.

3532
03:30:52,510 --> 03:30:54,190
This is a free audiobook.

3533
03:30:54,190 --> 03:30:57,690
And this is on the recording, too.

3534
03:30:57,690 --> 03:30:59,370
You are hearing me say this.

3535
03:30:59,370 --> 03:31:01,280
This is part of the audiobook.

3536
03:31:01,280 --> 03:31:02,879
This shit was free, okay?

3537
03:31:02,879 --> 03:31:08,510
I'm gonna take a break.

3538
03:31:08,510 --> 03:31:08,989
I'll be right back.

3539
03:31:08,989 --> 03:31:09,709
I'm gonna drink something.

3540
03:31:09,709 --> 03:31:09,950
Hold on.

3541
03:31:09,950 --> 03:31:13,020
Give me a minute.

3542
03:31:13,020 --> 03:31:14,219
No, don't edit this out.

3543
03:31:14,219 --> 03:31:16,010
Keep it in.

3544
03:31:16,010 --> 03:31:16,489
Keep it in.

3545
03:31:18,379 --> 03:31:22,909
Take the rusty pot.

3546
03:31:22,909 --> 03:31:24,110
Take the dented pot.

3547
03:31:24,110 --> 03:31:30,139
Take a new pot.

3548
03:31:30,139 --> 03:31:36,379
Uh, I don't know what the right answer here is.

3549
03:31:36,379 --> 03:31:38,670
Take the dented pot.

3550
03:31:38,670 --> 03:31:39,469
Okay, yeah.

3551
03:31:39,469 --> 03:31:41,389
You grab a surface of pot.

3552
03:31:41,389 --> 03:31:44,959
It's dented and old, but should hold its water.

3553
03:31:44,959 --> 03:31:45,600
Take it.

3554
03:31:45,600 --> 03:31:48,969
You heft up your pot and head over to the stove.

3555
03:31:48,969 --> 03:31:51,229
At the stove.

3556
03:31:51,229 --> 03:31:55,100
Returning back to the stove,

3557
03:31:55,100 --> 03:31:57,819
you fill the pot with your mangled vegetables.

3558
03:31:57,819 --> 03:31:59,760
You add the cleanest water you can find,

3559
03:31:59,760 --> 03:32:01,600
which isn't very clean,

3560
03:32:01,600 --> 03:32:03,709
and place it over the fire.

3561
03:32:03,709 --> 03:32:05,549
The group of goblins are still muttering.

3562
03:32:09,229 --> 03:32:11,790
You should pop through the tunnel and find out,

3563
03:32:11,790 --> 03:32:13,819
the third goblin says.

3564
03:32:13,819 --> 03:32:18,940
Oh, except there's no tunnel in the larder, of course.

3565
03:32:19,020 --> 03:32:21,340
Rumor is totally false.

3566
03:32:21,340 --> 03:32:25,950
Stir.

3567
03:32:25,950 --> 03:32:27,469
You stir carefully,

3568
03:32:27,469 --> 03:32:30,430
allowing yourself to relax for a moment as you take in the aroma.

3569
03:32:30,430 --> 03:32:33,049
It is an oddly calming moment,

3570
03:32:33,049 --> 03:32:37,450
but then your reverie is broken by filch.

3571
03:32:37,450 --> 03:32:40,920
Returning and dumping roach pig meat into the mix.

3572
03:32:40,920 --> 03:32:42,680
Hot water splashes up.

3573
03:32:42,680 --> 03:32:44,590
She looks disappointed.

3574
03:32:44,590 --> 03:32:47,309
Well, it's soup, I suppose.

3575
03:32:48,110 --> 03:32:50,030
We should add some more flavor.

3576
03:32:50,030 --> 03:32:51,870
There are spices over there.

3577
03:32:51,870 --> 03:32:53,739
Go look.

3578
03:32:53,739 --> 03:32:55,260
You fucking wanker.

3579
03:32:55,260 --> 03:32:57,559
She hurries away once more.

3580
03:32:57,559 --> 03:33:09,629
The spices are kept in boxes at the back of the room.

3581
03:33:09,629 --> 03:33:11,579
All the herbs are from Xamen,

3582
03:33:11,579 --> 03:33:13,659
and you don't recognize a single one.

3583
03:33:13,659 --> 03:33:21,600
Okay, read the labels.

3584
03:33:21,600 --> 03:33:23,629
Three labels stand out.

3585
03:33:23,629 --> 03:33:25,260
Ant powder.

3586
03:33:25,260 --> 03:33:27,639
Melted curios?

3587
03:33:27,639 --> 03:33:29,979
Curios?

3588
03:33:29,979 --> 03:33:34,200
Red eye tears.

3589
03:33:34,200 --> 03:33:38,569
What is melted curios?

3590
03:33:38,569 --> 03:33:41,610
Inside the jar is a solid lump of what looks like black wax.

3591
03:33:41,610 --> 03:33:43,229
It smells like a sewer.

3592
03:33:43,229 --> 03:33:46,329
From across the room, filch waves.

3593
03:33:46,329 --> 03:33:47,530
Not that one.

3594
03:33:47,530 --> 03:33:51,159
That one's for blackening the stove.

3595
03:33:51,159 --> 03:33:52,360
Uh, okay.

3596
03:33:52,360 --> 03:33:56,649
Pick something else.

3597
03:33:56,649 --> 03:34:02,270
Uh, how about the red eye tears?

3598
03:34:02,270 --> 03:34:03,549
Red eye tears?

3599
03:34:03,549 --> 03:34:04,719
Really?

3600
03:34:04,719 --> 03:34:07,680
Inside the jar is a fizzing bright red liquid.

3601
03:34:07,680 --> 03:34:11,180
A drop on your tongue burns a little, but pleasantly.

3602
03:34:11,180 --> 03:34:13,149
Take it.

3603
03:34:13,149 --> 03:34:16,540
Hot sauce.

3604
03:34:16,540 --> 03:34:28,190
Grab your jar, hoping that what's inside is edible.

3605
03:34:28,190 --> 03:34:29,709
You take your jar back to filch.

3606
03:34:29,709 --> 03:34:32,909
She squints at the label, then smiles.

3607
03:34:32,909 --> 03:34:34,670
That's an interesting choice.

3608
03:34:34,670 --> 03:34:40,940
Empty the jar of spice into the pot, or give the jar to filch.

3609
03:34:40,940 --> 03:34:48,620
We're just gonna dump the whole thing in?

3610
03:34:48,620 --> 03:34:54,889
Empty the jar of spice into the pot.

3611
03:34:54,889 --> 03:34:57,930
You pour some into the pot, and filch watches.

3612
03:34:57,930 --> 03:35:01,469
The soup bubbles and churns.

3613
03:35:01,469 --> 03:35:07,399
Is the bird man somebody else's talking?

3614
03:35:07,399 --> 03:35:08,920
Bird men are breeding.

3615
03:35:08,920 --> 03:35:10,959
That means they might rebel.

3616
03:35:10,959 --> 03:35:14,600
The fourth goblin asks from the nearby group nervously.

3617
03:35:14,600 --> 03:35:17,959
The Archmage can't control creatures he doesn't make.

3618
03:35:21,180 --> 03:35:27,500
Summoning all of your bile, you spit into the pot with fiendish glee.

3619
03:35:27,500 --> 03:35:29,000
Filch grins.

3620
03:35:29,000 --> 03:35:30,840
Traditional goblin cuisine.

3621
03:35:30,840 --> 03:35:32,600
I didn't know you so worldly.

3622
03:35:33,659 --> 03:35:34,590
Pfft.

3623
03:35:34,590 --> 03:35:36,540
She spits alongside you.

3624
03:35:36,540 --> 03:35:41,100
Your two phlegm streaks mingle into one spiraling galaxy of mucus,

3625
03:35:41,100 --> 03:35:43,180
before being lost from view.

3626
03:35:43,180 --> 03:35:45,319
That is disgusting.

3627
03:35:45,319 --> 03:35:50,040
Should I taste it?

3628
03:35:50,040 --> 03:35:57,790
You lift a spoonful and take a taste.

3629
03:35:57,790 --> 03:35:59,790
It's surprisingly palatable.

3630
03:35:59,790 --> 03:36:01,579
You stir the broth.

3631
03:36:01,579 --> 03:36:04,360
Excellent smells rise up from its surface.

3632
03:36:04,360 --> 03:36:07,879
At filch's insistence, Grog comes over to sniff the pot.

3633
03:36:09,450 --> 03:36:10,170
Not bad.

3634
03:36:11,440 --> 03:36:14,280
What's in it?

3635
03:36:14,280 --> 03:36:15,079
Roach pig?

3636
03:36:15,079 --> 03:36:17,799
The finest turnips?

3637
03:36:17,799 --> 03:36:18,920
Whatever I could find.

3638
03:36:19,000 --> 03:36:26,940
I mean, these are both true, but this is accurate.

3639
03:36:26,940 --> 03:36:29,639
Whatever I could find.

3640
03:36:29,639 --> 03:36:31,709
Whatever I could find.

3641
03:36:31,709 --> 03:36:36,559
Grog smacks filch across the back of the head in reply.

3642
03:36:36,559 --> 03:36:37,360
Like, what?

3643
03:36:37,360 --> 03:36:41,200
Grog takes a spoon and sips carefully.

3644
03:36:41,200 --> 03:36:44,520
Then he beams with pleasure.

3645
03:36:44,520 --> 03:36:45,559
Delightful.

3646
03:36:46,440 --> 03:36:48,760
Oh, come around, you lumps.

3647
03:36:48,760 --> 03:36:49,479
Hey, come here.

3648
03:36:50,040 --> 03:36:51,000
Oh, now.

3649
03:36:51,639 --> 03:36:53,129
Ow.

3650
03:36:53,129 --> 03:36:54,649
He gives you a hit on...

3651
03:36:54,649 --> 03:36:56,489
I don't need to read it.

3652
03:36:56,489 --> 03:36:57,209
You heard it.

3653
03:36:57,209 --> 03:36:58,010
I just did it.

3654
03:36:58,010 --> 03:36:59,559
I pantomimed it.

3655
03:36:59,559 --> 03:37:02,700
Now, this is a chef.

3656
03:37:02,700 --> 03:37:05,930
He's going places, you hear?

3657
03:37:05,930 --> 03:37:07,069
Ow.

3658
03:37:07,069 --> 03:37:08,989
You try to look suitably humble.

3659
03:37:08,989 --> 03:37:12,360
Someone take this to the mess hall.

3660
03:37:12,360 --> 03:37:16,219
And you, you get access to the good ingredients.

3661
03:37:17,920 --> 03:37:19,600
Go check out the larder.

3662
03:37:19,600 --> 03:37:21,200
It's full of real meat.

3663
03:37:21,200 --> 03:37:24,829
Trying not to think about what he means by real meat,

3664
03:37:24,829 --> 03:37:29,479
you head towards the larder.

3665
03:37:29,479 --> 03:37:30,360
We're allowed in.

3666
03:37:30,360 --> 03:37:31,319
This is big.

3667
03:37:31,319 --> 03:37:35,879
You open the door and slip into the larder.

3668
03:37:35,879 --> 03:37:38,889
It is stocked with food that looks actually edible,

3669
03:37:38,889 --> 03:37:41,209
unlike most of what is piled in the kitchen.

3670
03:37:41,209 --> 03:37:44,090
But there doesn't seem to be much more to it,

3671
03:37:44,090 --> 03:37:47,049
except that you were told that somewhere in here

3672
03:37:47,049 --> 03:37:49,850
is a secret passage into the heart of the fortress.

3673
03:37:49,850 --> 03:37:53,319
The door behind you opens and Philk slips in,

3674
03:37:53,319 --> 03:37:54,680
somewhat breathlessly.

3675
03:37:54,680 --> 03:37:57,760
I thought I could help.

3676
03:38:01,309 --> 03:38:02,719
Hmm.

3677
03:38:02,719 --> 03:38:04,030
Unlikely.

3678
03:38:04,030 --> 03:38:06,350
I heard there was a tunnel in here.

3679
03:38:06,350 --> 03:38:10,250
This affair has gone far enough.

3680
03:38:10,250 --> 03:38:11,930
I heard there was a tunnel in here.

3681
03:38:11,930 --> 03:38:17,579
This is giving it away.

3682
03:38:17,579 --> 03:38:22,409
I'm going to say it.

3683
03:38:22,409 --> 03:38:24,010
I heard there was a tunnel in here.

3684
03:38:24,010 --> 03:38:32,459
A tunnel into the fortress?

3685
03:38:32,459 --> 03:38:34,840
Is it true?

3686
03:38:34,840 --> 03:38:37,180
I've never heard of a tunnel.

3687
03:38:37,180 --> 03:38:40,860
But if it was true, why aren't people coming through?

3688
03:38:40,860 --> 03:38:45,440
Perhaps no one knows.

3689
03:38:45,440 --> 03:38:47,600
Yeah, they're like rats in there.

3690
03:38:47,600 --> 03:38:52,409
Rats always know when there are tunnels.

3691
03:38:52,409 --> 03:39:07,360
Enough talk.

3692
03:39:07,360 --> 03:39:10,569
You turn, ignoring the gobliness once more,

3693
03:39:10,569 --> 03:39:11,950
but she seems content.

3694
03:39:11,950 --> 03:39:15,319
She comes to stand beside you.

3695
03:39:15,319 --> 03:39:20,239
So, what shall we do next?

3696
03:39:20,239 --> 03:39:21,360
Tap the walls and inspect.

3697
03:39:21,360 --> 03:39:22,479
There's a lot of things here.

3698
03:39:22,479 --> 03:39:22,799
Take some...

3699
03:39:22,799 --> 03:39:24,250
Ooh, hold on.

3700
03:39:24,250 --> 03:39:25,290
Take some rations.

3701
03:39:25,290 --> 03:39:31,209
You were warned on your travels not to eat from the larder of Throg,

3702
03:39:31,209 --> 03:39:33,290
but was that because it would anger Throg

3703
03:39:33,370 --> 03:39:37,549
or because the food was somehow tainted?

3704
03:39:37,549 --> 03:39:38,110
Hmm.

3705
03:39:38,110 --> 03:39:44,750
Should I try it?

3706
03:39:44,750 --> 03:39:45,229
Okay.

3707
03:39:45,229 --> 03:39:45,709
I'll leave it.

3708
03:39:45,709 --> 03:39:46,270
Leave it, leave it.

3709
03:39:46,270 --> 03:39:47,440
Yep, yep, yep.

3710
03:39:47,440 --> 03:39:49,040
You leave the food on the shelves untouched.

3711
03:39:49,040 --> 03:39:50,799
Better not to risk it, whatever it might be.

3712
03:39:50,799 --> 03:39:53,049
So, what do you think it is?

3713
03:39:53,049 --> 03:39:55,260
It's a tunnel.

3714
03:39:55,260 --> 03:39:55,979
Ah.

3715
03:39:55,979 --> 03:39:59,389
What about ingredients?

3716
03:39:59,389 --> 03:40:02,590
Look on the shelves.

3717
03:40:02,590 --> 03:40:04,319
Search around the shelves

3718
03:40:04,319 --> 03:40:06,479
and come across an interesting old cloth bag

3719
03:40:06,479 --> 03:40:08,159
that rattles when you pick it up.

3720
03:40:08,159 --> 03:40:12,010
There's probably a fucking snake in here.

3721
03:40:12,010 --> 03:40:14,090
I'm putting it back.

3722
03:40:14,090 --> 03:40:18,540
There's no rewind, so I'm actually kind of scared of this.

3723
03:40:18,540 --> 03:40:24,170
Is there like a rattlesnake in there?

3724
03:40:24,170 --> 03:40:26,270
I'm gonna...

3725
03:40:26,270 --> 03:40:27,069
I'm...

3726
03:40:27,069 --> 03:40:27,389
I can't.

3727
03:40:27,389 --> 03:40:27,790
I don't know.

3728
03:40:27,790 --> 03:40:30,520
I don't know.

3729
03:40:30,520 --> 03:40:32,600
What should I get from here is good.

3730
03:40:32,600 --> 03:40:34,399
What should I get from here?

3731
03:40:34,399 --> 03:40:36,760
You ask Vilk.

3732
03:40:36,760 --> 03:40:37,799
What would you like?

3733
03:40:37,799 --> 03:40:40,280
That doesn't help.

3734
03:40:40,280 --> 03:40:49,629
Search around the sacks.

3735
03:40:49,629 --> 03:40:52,270
You move some sacks to get better access to the far wall,

3736
03:40:52,270 --> 03:40:54,010
but it is solid stone.

3737
03:40:54,010 --> 03:40:56,600
But as you're pushing them aside,

3738
03:40:56,600 --> 03:40:59,079
you realize the sacks are stacked very oddly.

3739
03:40:59,079 --> 03:41:03,739
A patch of floor right next to the teetering stack is bare.

3740
03:41:03,739 --> 03:41:08,120
Whoever stacked them avoided a single spot.

3741
03:41:08,120 --> 03:41:09,629
What is it?

3742
03:41:09,629 --> 03:41:10,750
Have you seen something?

3743
03:41:10,750 --> 03:41:14,430
Look at the spot.

3744
03:41:14,430 --> 03:41:17,069
Inspecting carefully,

3745
03:41:17,069 --> 03:41:20,030
you notice a thin seam running across some floorboards.

3746
03:41:20,030 --> 03:41:23,020
A less clever observer would never have noticed it.

3747
03:41:23,020 --> 03:41:25,819
You pick up a nearby fork and pry at the seam.

3748
03:41:25,819 --> 03:41:30,489
A section of floor pops up on disguised hinges.

3749
03:41:30,489 --> 03:41:31,290
A trapdoor!

3750
03:41:34,010 --> 03:41:35,049
Where does it lead?

3751
03:41:35,049 --> 03:41:37,049
Where does it lead?

3752
03:41:37,049 --> 03:41:37,850
You ask her.

3753
03:41:37,850 --> 03:41:40,030
I have no idea.

3754
03:41:40,030 --> 03:41:41,069
Inside the city?

3755
03:41:41,069 --> 03:41:47,209
Look down the trapdoor.

3756
03:41:47,209 --> 03:41:49,450
You peer down into the darkness below the kitchen.

3757
03:41:49,450 --> 03:41:51,530
A chill breeze is rushing along the tunnel.

3758
03:41:51,530 --> 03:41:54,889
It must go for some distance.

3759
03:41:54,889 --> 03:41:59,639
It really is a channel under the wall.

3760
03:41:59,639 --> 03:42:04,700
Do you want to come?

3761
03:42:04,700 --> 03:42:06,040
Inside?

3762
03:42:06,040 --> 03:42:07,879
They're all mad inside the walls.

3763
03:42:08,520 --> 03:42:18,649
I won't even be able to sleep again knowing that's here.

3764
03:42:18,649 --> 03:42:20,889
Bilk is tense as you peer down into the hole.

3765
03:42:20,889 --> 03:42:27,049
You could turn back or descend below.

3766
03:42:27,049 --> 03:42:31,040
Well, this is interesting because if we go back,

3767
03:42:31,040 --> 03:42:34,090
we'll head out this way and head here.

3768
03:42:34,090 --> 03:42:40,059
But this tunnel, if we don't die a horrible death somehow,

3769
03:42:40,059 --> 03:42:43,629
we will end up up here and then probably out this way.

3770
03:42:43,629 --> 03:42:47,840
What do you guys want to do?

3771
03:42:47,840 --> 03:42:53,659
Secret tunnel or main entrance?

3772
03:42:53,739 --> 03:42:55,579
I mean, do we even need to do a poll?

3773
03:42:55,579 --> 03:42:56,700
I feel like everyone's going to say tunnel.

3774
03:43:03,120 --> 03:43:03,920
It's going to be like 90%.

3775
03:43:04,879 --> 03:43:08,719
Okay, we'll go to another tunnel.

3776
03:43:08,719 --> 03:43:10,540
You worked for this.

3777
03:43:10,540 --> 03:43:11,180
Yeah, I did.

3778
03:43:11,180 --> 03:43:16,879
You climb downwards into the tunnel, squinting in the dim light.

3779
03:43:16,879 --> 03:43:20,760
It's narrow, but there doesn't seem to be anyone in it.

3780
03:43:20,760 --> 03:43:22,649
Are you really going?

3781
03:43:22,649 --> 03:43:24,090
Bilk whispers from above.

3782
03:43:24,090 --> 03:43:26,000
Come with me.

3783
03:43:26,000 --> 03:43:27,950
I have to.

3784
03:43:27,950 --> 03:43:29,069
Why would I stay?

3785
03:43:29,069 --> 03:43:31,319
Goodbye, Bilk.

3786
03:43:31,319 --> 03:43:34,200
Come with me.

3787
03:43:34,200 --> 03:43:36,440
She seems to consider your offer for a moment,

3788
03:43:36,440 --> 03:43:38,760
then she shakes her head.

3789
03:43:38,760 --> 03:43:40,840
I can't come with you.

3790
03:43:40,840 --> 03:43:42,120
Look at that tunnel.

3791
03:43:42,120 --> 03:43:44,250
I won't fit.

3792
03:43:44,250 --> 03:43:45,370
Isn't there another way?

3793
03:43:48,030 --> 03:43:51,360
Uh, I need to...

3794
03:43:51,360 --> 03:43:53,610
I'll come back for you.

3795
03:43:53,610 --> 03:43:58,799
I'll come back for you.

3796
03:43:58,799 --> 03:44:00,159
I'll come back for you.

3797
03:44:00,159 --> 03:44:02,799
You promise, but she shakes her head, not believing.

3798
03:44:02,799 --> 03:44:04,750
Goodbye.

3799
03:44:04,750 --> 03:44:09,530
I hope you find whatever it is you're looking for.

3800
03:44:09,530 --> 03:44:12,639
With that, she closes the trap door over your head.

3801
03:44:12,639 --> 03:44:17,469
You hear the scrape as a flower bag is shifted on top of it

3802
03:44:17,469 --> 03:44:19,629
and the distant wail of tears.

3803
03:44:19,629 --> 03:44:23,680
There's no turning back now.

3804
03:44:23,680 --> 03:44:31,180
No.

3805
03:44:31,180 --> 03:44:32,379
Okay, let's go.

3806
03:44:32,379 --> 03:44:40,000
You slither and slide your way down into the darkness of the tunnel.

3807
03:44:40,000 --> 03:44:42,250
It is unclear who built this.

3808
03:44:42,250 --> 03:44:45,530
There are no supports or indications of construction.

3809
03:44:45,530 --> 03:44:50,909
There seem to be tooth marks in the walls.

3810
03:44:50,909 --> 03:44:53,879
Scramble onwards.

3811
03:44:53,879 --> 03:44:55,799
You splash on through the shallow water.

3812
03:44:55,799 --> 03:45:02,139
The rock walls drip with dank moss and the smell is stale and fetid.

3813
03:45:02,139 --> 03:45:06,079
There's no way to tell how much more of this there is to go.

3814
03:45:06,079 --> 03:45:10,079
Scramble onwards.

3815
03:45:10,079 --> 03:45:13,469
You splash onwards.

3816
03:45:13,469 --> 03:45:17,149
The tunnel turns a corner here, rising upwards towards a chink of light.

3817
03:45:17,149 --> 03:45:20,909
Around the corner.

3818
03:45:20,909 --> 03:45:26,829
You climb upwards using the rough edge of the tunnel as footholds to ascend.

3819
03:45:26,829 --> 03:45:29,920
There is a fresh scent from somewhere overhead.

3820
03:45:29,920 --> 03:45:33,879
Keep climbing.

3821
03:45:33,879 --> 03:45:36,920
After some more clamoring, you come within sight of a grate in the ceiling.

3822
03:45:36,920 --> 03:45:42,940
Light filters through and standing right on top of it are a pair of feet.

3823
03:45:42,940 --> 03:45:45,840
Uh, let's see.

3824
03:45:45,840 --> 03:45:47,520
I'm gonna listen.

3825
03:45:47,520 --> 03:45:54,010
You wait a few seconds and are rewarded as the guards above begin to chatter.

3826
03:45:54,010 --> 03:45:55,959
I'm bored.

3827
03:45:55,959 --> 03:45:57,719
Silence! Guards don't talk!

3828
03:45:57,719 --> 03:45:59,979
But what are we guarding?

3829
03:45:59,979 --> 03:46:03,309
I don't know, but this spot's always been guarded, so we're guarding it!

3830
03:46:03,309 --> 03:46:09,180
Even if nothing ever happens here!

3831
03:46:09,180 --> 03:46:10,540
Uh, one cast.

3832
03:46:10,540 --> 03:46:13,639
What can I do?

3833
03:46:13,639 --> 03:46:18,620
You need to fart box the room.

3834
03:46:18,620 --> 03:46:20,059
Uh, I could just zap.

3835
03:46:20,059 --> 03:46:22,219
No, that would just, that would cause mayhem.

3836
03:46:25,639 --> 03:46:26,440
Dumb.

3837
03:46:26,440 --> 03:46:33,370
How much health do I have?

3838
03:46:33,370 --> 03:46:34,329
Oh my god.

3839
03:46:40,719 --> 03:46:42,399
This is, this is gonna be a problem.

3840
03:46:44,729 --> 03:46:49,020
I'm trying to stay undetected.

3841
03:46:49,020 --> 03:46:50,139
Create illusions.

3842
03:46:50,139 --> 03:46:52,139
Ooh, let's do that.

3843
03:46:56,540 --> 03:47:00,219
Reaching up to the stars, you create the magic, and the bracelet at your wrist begins to glow.

3844
03:47:00,940 --> 03:47:03,819
You have just a moment in which to choose your illusion.

3845
03:47:03,819 --> 03:47:08,319
You find the guards' mind nearby, ready to be deceived by an illusion.

3846
03:47:08,319 --> 03:47:11,200
Swarm of rats?

3847
03:47:11,200 --> 03:47:24,969
Set the grate on fire or release a poison gas.

3848
03:47:24,969 --> 03:47:26,940
Uh, let's do rats.

3849
03:47:26,940 --> 03:47:28,399
Rats are gas.

3850
03:47:28,399 --> 03:47:30,360
Yeah, rats.

3851
03:47:30,360 --> 03:47:36,159
You unleash a swarm of rats that scurry up through the grate and surround the guards' ankles.

3852
03:47:36,159 --> 03:47:36,879
Crip, quick!

3853
03:47:37,600 --> 03:47:38,799
We have to get away from here!

3854
03:47:38,799 --> 03:47:40,319
Come on, quickly, there's rats!

3855
03:47:40,319 --> 03:47:41,760
You hear their footsteps running away.

3856
03:47:42,829 --> 03:47:46,030
More light filters down from above now that the guards above have gone.

3857
03:47:46,030 --> 03:47:48,879
Quick, we have to get out of here!

3858
03:47:48,879 --> 03:47:51,610
Come, quickly!

3859
03:47:51,610 --> 03:47:54,040
Are they still there?

3860
03:47:54,040 --> 03:47:56,379
Okay, so they're gone.

3861
03:47:56,379 --> 03:47:58,139
So if I press on...

3862
03:47:58,139 --> 03:47:59,549
Can I press on?

3863
03:47:59,549 --> 03:48:03,069
You push on through the tunnel further underneath Manpeng.

3864
03:48:03,069 --> 03:48:04,430
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, I wanted to...

3865
03:48:04,430 --> 03:48:07,120
Oh, shit!

3866
03:48:07,120 --> 03:48:10,520
I wanted to, like, put, like, press on.

3867
03:48:10,520 --> 03:48:11,239
Oh.

3868
03:48:11,239 --> 03:48:18,010
Because what, couldn't I have come, like, uh, couldn't I have gone through the grate up here?

3869
03:48:18,010 --> 03:48:21,530
Like, there's no, there's no rewinding.

3870
03:48:21,530 --> 03:48:24,030
It's okay.

3871
03:48:24,030 --> 03:48:25,790
You might not actually have been able to do that.

3872
03:48:25,790 --> 03:48:29,120
You reach the end of the tunnel.

3873
03:48:29,120 --> 03:48:35,950
A short flight of slick stone steps leads up to a trapdoor in the ceiling.

3874
03:48:35,950 --> 03:48:37,069
Look at the trapdoor.

3875
03:48:37,069 --> 03:48:42,030
The trapdoor is set neatly into the rocky ceiling and is closed tight.

3876
03:48:42,030 --> 03:48:45,629
It looks as though it is, hasn't really been open for a very long time.

3877
03:48:45,629 --> 03:48:48,840
Can I open it?

3878
03:48:48,840 --> 03:48:52,520
You scramble quickly upwards, keen to get out of the tunnel as quickly as possible.

3879
03:48:52,520 --> 03:48:59,389
But the trapdoor, when you reach it, is so firmly locked, it does not even shiver when you shove at it.

3880
03:48:59,389 --> 03:49:00,909
Uh, this is what DOP is for.

3881
03:49:00,909 --> 03:49:12,139
We can do it.

3882
03:49:12,139 --> 03:49:12,860
Should work, right?

3883
03:49:15,739 --> 03:49:21,799
Yawb is an amazing idea, but we will absolutely alert the Archmage that I'm here.

3884
03:49:22,360 --> 03:49:30,010
You weave the constellations into a pattern around you, but nothing happens.

3885
03:49:30,010 --> 03:49:32,159
The trapdoor does not even shake.

3886
03:49:32,159 --> 03:49:35,319
Perhaps it is protected by some magical defense?

3887
03:49:35,319 --> 03:49:37,979
Or else, it is not a door at all.

3888
03:49:37,979 --> 03:49:42,270
You bang on the trapdoor.

3889
03:49:42,270 --> 03:49:44,190
It doesn't budge, not even slightly.

3890
03:49:44,190 --> 03:49:46,590
More suspiciously, it barely even booms.

3891
03:49:46,590 --> 03:49:49,920
Pull at the wood.

3892
03:49:49,920 --> 03:49:53,920
Pull at the wood of the trapdoor, and after some work with the chopping knife,

3893
03:49:53,920 --> 03:49:57,579
a strip falls away, revealing smooth rock beneath.

3894
03:49:57,579 --> 03:50:02,190
It seems this was once a trapdoor, but it has since been filled in,

3895
03:50:02,190 --> 03:50:07,790
perhaps with a petrification spell, cast onto the wood itself.

3896
03:50:07,790 --> 03:50:08,510
Oh.

3897
03:50:08,510 --> 03:50:11,799
There's no way up from the tunnel, it seems.

3898
03:50:11,799 --> 03:50:15,159
You turn back hopelessly towards the thin light from the grate.

3899
03:50:15,159 --> 03:50:16,940
What?

3900
03:50:16,940 --> 03:50:22,780
You return along the tunnel when you hear something growling.

3901
03:50:22,780 --> 03:50:25,579
It seems your banging has attracted attention.

3902
03:50:25,579 --> 03:50:28,920
Oh god.

3903
03:50:28,920 --> 03:50:30,680
You stop to listen.

3904
03:50:30,680 --> 03:50:32,280
The sound is all too familiar.

3905
03:50:32,280 --> 03:50:34,649
It's the yawning growl of a rat bear.

3906
03:50:34,649 --> 03:50:46,829
The sound is getting closer.

3907
03:50:46,829 --> 03:50:48,030
Uh, create glue.

3908
03:50:51,290 --> 03:50:51,850
A jig.

3909
03:50:53,790 --> 03:50:57,690
Uh, pot.

3910
03:51:00,600 --> 03:51:01,559
No zip.

3911
03:51:01,559 --> 03:51:06,540
Let's do it.

3912
03:51:06,540 --> 03:51:15,739
You cast the enchantment, pulling out your bamboo flute and starting to play.

3913
03:51:15,739 --> 03:51:18,059
For a moment, it seems like it is having no effect.

3914
03:51:18,620 --> 03:51:22,219
The rat bear lashes at you with its tail and claws,

3915
03:51:22,219 --> 03:51:26,750
but then you notice that the attacks are rhythmic and symmetric.

3916
03:51:26,750 --> 03:51:28,540
The creature is dancing.

3917
03:51:28,540 --> 03:51:31,739
Nasty, spiky dancing that would kill anyone who came too close.

3918
03:51:31,739 --> 03:51:33,879
But dancing nonetheless.

3919
03:51:33,879 --> 03:51:37,520
It is unclear how this will help you, however.

3920
03:51:37,520 --> 03:51:39,120
Uh, let's go down the tunnel.

3921
03:51:39,120 --> 03:51:42,250
You lead the rat bear a short way along the tunnel.

3922
03:51:42,250 --> 03:51:46,809
It splashes and twists in the water, making strange shapes and movements with its tail.

3923
03:51:46,809 --> 03:51:51,319
Keep playing, keep playing, keep playing.

3924
03:51:51,319 --> 03:51:53,319
You keep playing, hoping to wear the creature out.

3925
03:51:53,319 --> 03:51:54,280
Perhaps it is working.

3926
03:51:54,280 --> 03:51:55,579
It is hard to tell.

3927
03:51:55,579 --> 03:51:58,219
You finish your playing and lower the pipe from your lips.

3928
03:51:58,219 --> 03:52:02,940
The rat bear ceases its dance and looks at you through narrow animal eyes.

3929
03:52:02,940 --> 03:52:09,659
Then it bows its head, turns, and disappears down the passage into the dark.

3930
03:52:09,659 --> 03:52:11,500
You stop to recover your breath.

3931
03:52:11,500 --> 03:52:15,979
But though you are alive, you're still stuck down in the dark.

3932
03:52:15,979 --> 03:52:26,299
I was thinking I could bring him down the hallway and have him attack the door.

3933
03:52:26,299 --> 03:52:28,379
Okay, I think we have to go giant here.

3934
03:52:28,379 --> 03:52:32,190
Oh wait, no, shit.

3935
03:52:32,190 --> 03:52:33,629
Yeah, let's just do it.

3936
03:52:33,629 --> 03:52:34,190
Fuck it.

3937
03:52:34,190 --> 03:52:36,829
Let's just go for it.

3938
03:52:36,829 --> 03:52:44,159
Shit!

3939
03:52:47,479 --> 03:52:52,120
The archmage is on the toilet right now and his whole fortress just shook.

3940
03:52:52,120 --> 03:52:54,889
What in the hell was that?

3941
03:52:54,889 --> 03:52:56,760
What was that?

3942
03:52:56,760 --> 03:53:01,000
You pull the giant's tooth from your pack and throw it on the ground,

3943
03:53:01,000 --> 03:53:02,440
casting your spell across it.

3944
03:53:02,440 --> 03:53:06,909
The tooth erupts into a column of smoke from which a towering giant steps out.

3945
03:53:08,000 --> 03:53:10,479
The giant does not fit in the tunnel.

3946
03:53:10,479 --> 03:53:14,719
And once it appears, it fills the tunnel entirely, grumbling.

3947
03:53:14,719 --> 03:53:18,399
One elbow squashes up against the grate and it flips open.

3948
03:53:18,399 --> 03:53:26,270
Moments before the giant pops out of existence once more.

3949
03:53:26,270 --> 03:53:27,469
All right, let's get the hell out of here.

3950
03:53:27,469 --> 03:53:28,750
Hold on, look up at it yet.

3951
03:53:29,309 --> 03:53:31,100
It's just, okay, it's open.

3952
03:53:31,100 --> 03:53:32,799
Listen, anybody there?

3953
03:53:32,799 --> 03:53:33,600
Nobody there?

3954
03:53:33,600 --> 03:53:35,959
Let's go.

3955
03:53:35,959 --> 03:53:39,870
You jump to try and grab the overhead grate, but you cannot reach it.

3956
03:53:39,870 --> 03:53:43,020
Probably float up there.

3957
03:53:44,649 --> 03:53:45,690
It was already open?

3958
03:53:46,489 --> 03:53:50,190
Wait, the grate was open already.

3959
03:53:55,000 --> 03:53:55,799
Oh goodness.

3960
03:53:57,600 --> 03:54:00,280
Uh, so just...

3961
03:54:01,469 --> 03:54:01,969
What?

3962
03:54:04,219 --> 03:54:06,459
What is Zob?

3963
03:54:06,459 --> 03:54:07,500
I've never heard of Zob.

3964
03:54:13,870 --> 03:54:14,370
Gak.

3965
03:54:18,010 --> 03:54:19,129
I can't float up there.

3966
03:54:19,129 --> 03:54:19,770
I can't reach it.

3967
03:54:20,409 --> 03:54:23,559
Try someone, another giant.

3968
03:54:24,600 --> 03:54:26,120
Someone, a second giant.

3969
03:54:35,879 --> 03:54:36,920
Replica creature.

3970
03:54:38,840 --> 03:54:39,639
Illusion.

3971
03:54:39,639 --> 03:54:40,520
I just need to get out.

3972
03:54:45,959 --> 03:54:46,920
Like, how do I get out of here?

3973
03:54:51,280 --> 03:54:54,399
Looking, you cast the spell, but the grate is already open.

3974
03:54:54,399 --> 03:54:55,120
Okay, so wait.

3975
03:54:55,680 --> 03:54:56,879
You settle down to wait.

3976
03:54:57,440 --> 03:54:59,879
There seems to be nothing else you can do.

3977
03:55:00,840 --> 03:55:02,120
Hours pass.

3978
03:55:02,120 --> 03:55:05,129
Then you hear a distant rumbling noise.

3979
03:55:05,129 --> 03:55:09,309
What about Zen?

3980
03:55:09,309 --> 03:55:11,280
I think all I had was Zap, right?

3981
03:55:11,280 --> 03:55:14,590
Did I, was Zen available?

3982
03:55:14,590 --> 03:55:15,709
I thought it was just Zap.

3983
03:55:15,709 --> 03:55:16,989
It was, it was Z-E-N.

3984
03:55:16,989 --> 03:55:22,299
It wasn't, it wasn't just Z-A, really?

3985
03:55:22,299 --> 03:55:27,479
I didn't see Zen.

3986
03:55:27,479 --> 03:55:28,760
You had, I had Zen.

3987
03:55:28,760 --> 03:55:29,719
I thought it was just Zap.

3988
03:55:30,360 --> 03:55:31,639
Okay, well, I'm gonna brace myself there.

3989
03:55:32,280 --> 03:55:35,600
You brace yourself fairly certain what is coming.

3990
03:55:35,600 --> 03:55:36,479
Water.

3991
03:55:36,479 --> 03:55:39,440
A high, heavy torrent of water that fills the tunnel.

3992
03:55:39,440 --> 03:55:41,440
You have moments before it strikes.

3993
03:55:43,520 --> 03:55:47,040
You fill your lungs, then the wall of water strikes,

3994
03:55:47,040 --> 03:55:48,959
thumping hard into your body.

3995
03:55:48,959 --> 03:55:52,700
The world is turned upside down and you cannot see for rising bubbles.

3996
03:55:52,700 --> 03:55:57,149
You are only held in place by clinging onto the hole in the ceiling.

3997
03:55:57,149 --> 03:55:59,870
Thank God I did this first.

3998
03:55:59,870 --> 03:56:01,069
Pull myself up.

3999
03:56:01,069 --> 03:56:05,879
As the water rises, you grab onto the open grate and haul yourself upwards,

4000
03:56:05,879 --> 03:56:07,770
fighting hard against the current.

4001
03:56:07,770 --> 03:56:08,959
Keep pulling.

4002
03:56:08,959 --> 03:56:11,360
You keep pulling, hauling yourself towards the hatch.

4003
03:56:11,360 --> 03:56:15,159
Things brush past your body, washed away by the current.

4004
03:56:15,159 --> 03:56:16,969
Climb out.

4005
03:56:16,969 --> 03:56:19,149
Nice.

4006
03:56:19,149 --> 03:56:22,280
After more heaving, you manage to pull yourself out through the grate.

4007
03:56:22,280 --> 03:56:25,899
Once your legs are out of the water, getting free of the tunnel is easier.

4008
03:56:25,899 --> 03:56:28,940
Of course, all of your water-damageable possessions have been ruined,

4009
03:56:28,940 --> 03:56:32,010
including the goblin's precious parchment.

4010
03:56:32,010 --> 03:56:32,809
Oh, great.

4011
03:56:32,809 --> 03:56:35,340
Thank, wait, is that bad?

4012
03:56:35,340 --> 03:56:37,899
Thankfully, however, the pages of your spellbook are protected,

4013
03:56:37,899 --> 03:56:39,899
but all of your soft food has been ruined.

4014
03:56:39,899 --> 03:56:45,049
That's fantastic.

4015
03:56:45,049 --> 03:56:48,680
Out of the tunnel.

4016
03:56:48,680 --> 03:56:53,200
You step out onto the dirt of Mampang and kick the grate shut behind you.

4017
03:56:53,200 --> 03:56:56,920
You try to shake the water from your cloak.

4018
03:56:56,920 --> 03:56:59,799
You are in a narrow alley between two large buildings.

4019
03:56:59,799 --> 03:57:03,629
At the far end, you can see a glimpse of some kind of plaza.

4020
03:57:03,629 --> 03:57:06,030
The wind picks up as the evening draws on.

4021
03:57:06,030 --> 03:57:07,149
Soon it'll be dark.

4022
03:57:07,149 --> 03:57:07,870
Once more.

4023
03:57:07,870 --> 03:57:09,639
You slip your way forwards.

4024
03:57:09,639 --> 03:57:17,790
This is where we ended up.

4025
03:57:17,790 --> 03:57:21,799
Along the alley.

4026
03:57:21,799 --> 03:57:25,180
There is barely enough space to walk between the two buildings,

4027
03:57:25,180 --> 03:57:29,100
which list inwards on both sides.

4028
03:57:29,100 --> 03:57:31,319
Look at the buildings.

4029
03:57:31,319 --> 03:57:35,239
The buildings on both sides are topped by large glass domes.

4030
03:57:35,239 --> 03:57:37,479
The one on the right larger than that on the left.

4031
03:57:37,479 --> 03:57:40,280
You slide onwards down the alleyway.

4032
03:57:40,280 --> 03:57:51,879
The alley widens out a little here.

4033
03:57:51,879 --> 03:57:53,479
As it approaches the square at the end.

4034
03:57:53,479 --> 03:57:55,610
You are inside the city.

4035
03:57:55,610 --> 03:57:57,049
Time to explore.

4036
03:57:57,049 --> 03:58:00,409
Looking around, you are surprised to find that this part of Mampang

4037
03:58:00,409 --> 03:58:02,649
is more like a city than you expected.

4038
03:58:02,649 --> 03:58:06,270
There are merchants, laborers, and swaggering guards.

4039
03:58:06,270 --> 03:58:09,680
Washing hangs from hooks outside the stacked houses.

4040
03:58:09,680 --> 03:58:12,639
Of course, there are far more wicked glares and knives

4041
03:58:12,639 --> 03:58:15,309
tucked into belts than even in Kare.

4042
03:58:15,309 --> 03:58:18,430
Suddenly you feel hooked fingers catch your arm.

4043
03:58:18,430 --> 03:58:22,479
Turn around.

4044
03:58:22,479 --> 03:58:27,159
You turn around and catch a glimpse of a hoary old beggar.

4045
03:58:27,159 --> 03:58:28,600
Pulling at you.

4046
03:58:28,600 --> 03:58:31,209
But then something happens and you lose sight of him.

4047
03:58:31,209 --> 03:58:36,559
A moment later the tall buildings of Mampang that you traveled so far to reach

4048
03:58:36,559 --> 03:58:37,600
have disappeared.

4049
03:58:37,600 --> 03:58:47,079
You stand in a humid climate.

4050
03:58:47,079 --> 03:58:50,620
Tall plants lean down on all sides.

4051
03:58:50,620 --> 03:58:54,299
And a thin, watery sunlight leaks through some kind of glass ceiling.

4052
03:58:54,299 --> 03:58:55,930
Choked with weeds.

4053
03:58:55,930 --> 03:58:58,540
Libra?

4054
03:58:58,540 --> 03:59:01,000
But there is no sign of the goddess.

4055
03:59:01,000 --> 03:59:03,639
The beggar is still here, however.

4056
03:59:03,639 --> 03:59:05,239
But no longer holding your arm.

4057
03:59:05,239 --> 03:59:10,559
He stands taller and seems better fed.

4058
03:59:10,559 --> 03:59:11,360
That's better.

4059
03:59:12,319 --> 03:59:14,000
Now we can talk more freely.

4060
03:59:14,000 --> 03:59:18,379
What have you done?

4061
03:59:18,379 --> 03:59:19,420
Moved us elsewhere.

4062
03:59:20,139 --> 03:59:22,139
This is a favorite little spot of mine.

4063
03:59:22,139 --> 03:59:24,299
A forgotten corner of Kare.

4064
03:59:24,299 --> 03:59:26,639
The lost gardens of Braia.

4065
03:59:26,639 --> 03:59:29,979
Even the gardeners who work here can't remember the way in.

4066
03:59:29,979 --> 03:59:33,209
It's on all the maps, but no one can find the entrance.

4067
03:59:33,209 --> 03:59:35,440
My own little fortress.

4068
03:59:35,440 --> 03:59:39,440
He reaches rather tenderly for a nearby plant and pulls off a graying leaf.

4069
03:59:39,440 --> 03:59:42,989
Who are you?

4070
03:59:42,989 --> 03:59:44,270
My name is Throban.

4071
03:59:44,270 --> 03:59:46,729
The beggar bows most politely.

4072
03:59:46,729 --> 03:59:49,690
You notice he wears a circlet of finger bones on his hand.

4073
03:59:49,690 --> 03:59:51,739
On his head.

4074
03:59:51,739 --> 03:59:54,059
Some have called me necromancer.

4075
03:59:54,059 --> 03:59:59,450
They only mean that death has never stopped my work.

4076
03:59:59,450 --> 04:00:03,020
Uh, you're dead?

4077
04:00:03,020 --> 04:00:04,139
Sometimes.

4078
04:00:04,139 --> 04:00:05,340
Not entirely.

4079
04:00:05,340 --> 04:00:08,780
Though I rather think I soon will be.

4080
04:00:08,780 --> 04:00:13,370
Well, soon can be confusing, of course.

4081
04:00:13,370 --> 04:00:15,209
Perhaps we should start from the beginning.

4082
04:00:15,209 --> 04:00:17,420
Throban smiles.

4083
04:00:17,420 --> 04:00:18,860
Come, let's take a walk, shall we?

4084
04:00:18,860 --> 04:00:24,010
He begins to saunter between the trees, and you follow.

4085
04:00:24,010 --> 04:00:26,090
This place is hidden from the Archmage?

4086
04:00:26,090 --> 04:00:28,120
You observe.

4087
04:00:28,120 --> 04:00:29,799
Quite so, quite so.

4088
04:00:29,799 --> 04:00:35,639
The Archmage would chew a death sponge mushroom and then eat my brains if he had the chance.

4089
04:00:35,639 --> 04:00:41,100
But for us all, it's best if that doesn't happen.

4090
04:00:41,100 --> 04:00:42,620
I must return to Mampang.

4091
04:00:42,620 --> 04:00:45,440
I have a mission.

4092
04:00:45,440 --> 04:00:47,790
Of great importance, I know, I know, I know.

4093
04:00:47,790 --> 04:00:50,510
But I must tell you, if you attempt your mission, you will die.

4094
04:00:52,780 --> 04:00:54,620
I must take that risk.

4095
04:00:54,620 --> 04:00:57,659
Perhaps you could try to understand it first.

4096
04:00:57,659 --> 04:01:01,389
He replies with a slight sigh.

4097
04:01:01,389 --> 04:01:05,360
In Mampang, death can be quite final.

4098
04:01:05,360 --> 04:01:07,840
The reach of the gods is limited there.

4099
04:01:07,840 --> 04:01:11,200
There's not always a way out, and you will die.

4100
04:01:11,200 --> 04:01:14,520
Throban points at a nearby flower.

4101
04:01:14,520 --> 04:01:16,239
Do you see this one?

4102
04:01:16,239 --> 04:01:17,520
Purple thornweed.

4103
04:01:17,520 --> 04:01:19,280
Only grows in one place.

4104
04:01:19,280 --> 04:01:21,520
The slopes above my home village.

4105
04:01:21,520 --> 04:01:26,030
It's very nice.

4106
04:01:26,030 --> 04:01:26,590
It was.

4107
04:01:27,309 --> 04:01:29,950
I grew up in the same village as the Archmage, you know.

4108
04:01:29,950 --> 04:01:33,120
Small place called Kariama.

4109
04:01:33,120 --> 04:01:34,079
Kariama.

4110
04:01:34,079 --> 04:01:37,079
Maybe you've heard of it.

4111
04:01:37,079 --> 04:01:39,319
He sweeps away, his face hidden from view.

4112
04:01:39,319 --> 04:01:40,040
This way now.

4113
04:01:40,040 --> 04:01:40,440
Follow me.

4114
04:01:40,440 --> 04:01:41,079
Come on.

4115
04:01:41,079 --> 04:01:44,010
He steps between two plants and disappears.

4116
04:01:44,010 --> 04:01:47,659
Where is this on the map?

4117
04:01:47,659 --> 04:01:49,680
Down here in Kari.

4118
04:01:50,479 --> 04:01:51,680
Uh, this is the second game.

4119
04:01:52,319 --> 04:01:54,280
This is my favorite of the four games.

4120
04:01:54,840 --> 04:01:59,579
I would say if I was to do a tier list of sorcery, this would be at S tier.

4121
04:02:00,139 --> 04:02:02,989
This is by far some of the most fun I've ever had in a video game.

4122
04:02:03,629 --> 04:02:05,149
I love Kari.

4123
04:02:05,149 --> 04:02:06,670
There's so much to do here.

4124
04:02:07,899 --> 04:02:11,020
It's, there's so many funny characters, so many wacky scenarios.

4125
04:02:12,670 --> 04:02:13,709
It's, it's just the best.

4126
04:02:14,270 --> 04:02:17,309
Into the garden.

4127
04:02:17,309 --> 04:02:22,989
You push your way between the plants and find the beggar waiting.

4128
04:02:22,989 --> 04:02:24,750
Only now he is no beggar,

4129
04:02:24,750 --> 04:02:28,829
but a tall, handsome man wearing a long cloak embroidered with runes of power.

4130
04:02:30,719 --> 04:02:32,559
There you are.

4131
04:02:32,559 --> 04:02:34,479
I was told to expect you.

4132
04:02:34,479 --> 04:02:39,260
Where's the old man?

4133
04:02:39,260 --> 04:02:40,700
Safely in my future.

4134
04:02:41,840 --> 04:02:43,600
Please excuse any confusion.

4135
04:02:43,600 --> 04:02:47,040
I use these gardens for conversations quite extensively,

4136
04:02:47,040 --> 04:02:49,120
but I have to space them out.

4137
04:02:49,120 --> 04:02:51,399
One cannot have things overlapping.

4138
04:02:51,399 --> 04:02:52,760
Now then.

4139
04:02:52,760 --> 04:03:01,799
I believe we are, will be talking about Manpang and your impending death.

4140
04:03:01,799 --> 04:03:03,479
I'm not going to die.

4141
04:03:03,479 --> 04:03:05,260
Oh, you most certainly are.

4142
04:03:05,899 --> 04:03:07,340
Often I shouldn't wonder.

4143
04:03:07,899 --> 04:03:09,020
He points up.

4144
04:03:09,020 --> 04:03:12,159
The dome is gone and it is now nighttime.

4145
04:03:12,159 --> 04:03:14,430
Stars shine overhead.

4146
04:03:14,430 --> 04:03:18,090
I like these gardens for one reason above all.

4147
04:03:18,090 --> 04:03:19,049
Can you see what it is?

4148
04:03:21,879 --> 04:03:24,920
The constellations.

4149
04:03:24,920 --> 04:03:25,639
Exactly.

4150
04:03:26,700 --> 04:03:28,540
Look up there.

4151
04:03:28,540 --> 04:03:35,680
This is one of the only two places in Kaare where the stars of the Zed spell can be seen.

4152
04:03:35,680 --> 04:03:42,520
The other is by the North Gate, but that spot's rather too busy.

4153
04:03:42,520 --> 04:03:44,120
What do you know of that spell?

4154
04:03:44,120 --> 04:03:47,280
The mention of the Zed spell makes you stop short.

4155
04:03:47,280 --> 04:03:51,440
The secret magic, the most powerful knowledge unknown to all.

4156
04:03:51,440 --> 04:03:53,440
What do you know of that spell, you demand?

4157
04:03:55,340 --> 04:04:00,000
Zed is the great discovery of the necromancers.

4158
04:04:00,000 --> 04:04:03,559
A spell powered by and fascinated by death.

4159
04:04:03,559 --> 04:04:06,510
Some thought it prevented death, but it does not.

4160
04:04:06,829 --> 04:04:08,110
Quite the opposite.

4161
04:04:08,110 --> 04:04:16,760
The stars of Zed cause a death of the most significant, final kind.

4162
04:04:16,760 --> 04:04:18,989
What kind of death is that?

4163
04:04:18,989 --> 04:04:20,479
The true death.

4164
04:04:20,479 --> 04:04:21,520
The absence.

4165
04:04:21,520 --> 04:04:24,750
But the secret is too powerful to share openly.

4166
04:04:24,750 --> 04:04:26,040
Please.

4167
04:04:26,040 --> 04:04:29,879
He gestures at another path leading between trees as wide as bears

4168
04:04:29,879 --> 04:04:33,360
that have fallen together to form an arch.

4169
04:04:33,360 --> 04:04:34,239
After you.

4170
04:04:34,239 --> 04:04:41,229
Through the arch.

4171
04:04:41,229 --> 04:04:45,309
You slip under the arch and arrive in a field of bright yellow and purple flowers.

4172
04:04:45,309 --> 04:04:47,450
Terrifically overgrown.

4173
04:04:47,450 --> 04:04:51,399
Brambles choke the edges of the path the man does not follow.

4174
04:04:51,399 --> 04:04:54,600
Call out.

4175
04:04:54,600 --> 04:04:56,040
You call out but hear no response.

4176
04:04:56,040 --> 04:04:57,639
It seems you are quite alone.

4177
04:04:57,639 --> 04:04:59,610
High above you.

4178
04:04:59,610 --> 04:05:03,370
You see two harpies flying past, screaming to each other and pointing.

4179
04:05:03,370 --> 04:05:05,469
But they are not coming for you.

4180
04:05:05,469 --> 04:05:09,000
Search the bushes.

4181
04:05:09,000 --> 04:05:11,639
You search the bushes but find nothing.

4182
04:05:11,639 --> 04:05:13,399
There's nothing hiding there.

4183
04:05:13,399 --> 04:05:16,239
Nothing is waiting for you.

4184
04:05:16,239 --> 04:05:16,959
Move on.

4185
04:05:16,959 --> 04:05:20,649
The beggar has abandoned you.

4186
04:05:20,649 --> 04:05:30,680
It seems you must find the path back to Manpang yourself.

4187
04:05:30,680 --> 04:05:34,780
Onwards.

4188
04:05:34,780 --> 04:05:38,540
You push forwards through the towering flowers into an area of cracked blue paving

4189
04:05:38,540 --> 04:05:41,659
and ronded shrubs in a glass pot.

4190
04:05:41,659 --> 04:05:44,559
To your relief, the beggar is here once more.

4191
04:05:44,559 --> 04:05:48,809
He looks older than ever.

4192
04:05:48,809 --> 04:05:51,639
Now you understand.

4193
04:05:51,639 --> 04:05:57,450
Now you see why you have to die.

4194
04:05:57,450 --> 04:06:00,559
I do not understand you.

4195
04:06:00,559 --> 04:06:02,399
I'll tell you all you need to know.

4196
04:06:04,000 --> 04:06:07,799
This end spell is difficult to cast, you see.

4197
04:06:07,799 --> 04:06:10,200
Because you can't cast it at once.

4198
04:06:10,200 --> 04:06:13,469
You have to cast it at two separate times.

4199
04:06:14,030 --> 04:06:15,479
Two times.

4200
04:06:15,479 --> 04:06:16,920
But one casting.

4201
04:06:16,920 --> 04:06:18,139
Got it?

4202
04:06:18,139 --> 04:06:20,620
Like left and right hands clasped together.

4203
04:06:20,620 --> 04:06:22,120
He demonstrates.

4204
04:06:22,120 --> 04:06:24,440
Linking thumbs and flapping his fingers like a butterfly.

4205
04:06:28,409 --> 04:06:31,209
Uh, go on.

4206
04:06:31,209 --> 04:06:35,389
So you cast it then and before.

4207
04:06:35,389 --> 04:06:39,709
And when both castings are cast, they are the same casting.

4208
04:06:39,709 --> 04:06:43,290
Two castings at different times cannot be at different times.

4209
04:06:43,290 --> 04:06:45,770
So the time between disappears.

4210
04:06:45,770 --> 04:06:54,489
He squashes his butterfly fingers into a single two-handed fist.

4211
04:06:54,489 --> 04:06:56,430
Time collapses?

4212
04:06:56,430 --> 04:06:57,629
Beautifully put.

4213
04:06:57,629 --> 04:07:02,200
The beggar spits a tooth and picks it up to admire.

4214
04:07:02,200 --> 04:07:04,120
Be valuable, Bat.

4215
04:07:04,120 --> 04:07:05,239
One of these days.

4216
04:07:09,129 --> 04:07:10,860
Take the tooth.

4217
04:07:10,860 --> 04:07:12,219
You reach down for it.

4218
04:07:12,219 --> 04:07:13,979
Uncouth villain!

4219
04:07:15,340 --> 04:07:16,940
Now we'd best be getting on.

4220
04:07:16,940 --> 04:07:20,250
We don't want you coming back here when you finally die.

4221
04:07:23,770 --> 04:07:25,930
When I die?

4222
04:07:25,930 --> 04:07:26,489
Yes.

4223
04:07:26,489 --> 04:07:31,229
Throbin closes his dirt-smudged eyes and concentrates.

4224
04:07:31,229 --> 04:07:34,120
And slowly the walls of Manpang return.

4225
04:07:34,120 --> 04:07:45,770
There you are again.

4226
04:07:47,579 --> 04:07:49,020
Hey, not a word.

4227
04:07:49,020 --> 04:07:50,379
There are spies everywhere.

4228
04:07:50,379 --> 04:07:52,829
One last thing to do.

4229
04:07:52,829 --> 04:07:53,629
Draw your sword.

4230
04:07:56,559 --> 04:07:57,280
Why?

4231
04:07:57,280 --> 04:07:59,290
You ask suspiciously.

4232
04:07:59,290 --> 04:08:01,850
It's the sort of thing people do in Manpang.

4233
04:08:01,850 --> 04:08:02,569
Draw it.

4234
04:08:02,569 --> 04:08:06,809
Okay.

4235
04:08:06,809 --> 04:08:09,420
You obediently draw your blade.

4236
04:08:09,420 --> 04:08:11,340
Throbin beams with glee.

4237
04:08:11,340 --> 04:08:15,739
And then before you can stop him, he runs himself deep onto the blade.

4238
04:08:15,739 --> 04:08:20,030
For the ghosts of the backlands, I curse you with this.

4239
04:08:21,879 --> 04:08:24,670
He whispers.

4240
04:08:24,670 --> 04:08:26,590
And there is fury in his eyes.

4241
04:08:26,590 --> 04:08:32,110
In the last moments, you see him hurl his arms up, creating some kind of incantation.

4242
04:08:32,110 --> 04:08:37,120
A terrible force builds around his body, but then seems to only half explode.

4243
04:08:37,120 --> 04:08:40,760
You are caught at the moment of detonation.

4244
04:08:40,760 --> 04:08:52,280
The explosion dies away, its force curiously unspent, as though waiting.

4245
04:08:52,280 --> 04:09:00,920
But you feel stronger for it.

4246
04:09:00,920 --> 04:09:03,239
You look around, still disoriented.

4247
04:09:03,239 --> 04:09:05,659
There's no sign of the beggar.

4248
04:09:05,659 --> 04:09:08,379
The narrow alley mouth opens onto the square.

4249
04:09:08,379 --> 04:09:09,180
Darkness closes in.

4250
04:09:09,180 --> 04:09:11,340
You need to rest, especially on an empty stomach.

4251
04:09:16,649 --> 04:09:17,370
I'm going to sleep here.

4252
04:09:19,360 --> 04:09:20,879
The alley isn't a bad place to rest.

4253
04:09:20,879 --> 04:09:23,280
It's quiet, secluded, and offers plenty of shadow.

4254
04:09:24,000 --> 04:09:27,600
Removing your pack, you try to settle despite the strange noises that drift through the air.

4255
04:09:27,600 --> 04:09:29,389
You've eaten nothing today.

4256
04:09:29,389 --> 04:09:32,430
But you have no provisions and only two vials of blimberry juice.

4257
04:09:35,209 --> 04:09:36,010
I'm not going to drink that.

4258
04:09:36,649 --> 04:09:39,450
Close my eyes.

4259
04:09:39,450 --> 04:09:41,530
You close your eyes and let your tiredness overtake you.

4260
04:09:42,170 --> 04:09:45,120
What is left of the night is restless with visions.

4261
04:09:45,120 --> 04:09:46,959
You're lying on cool, moist ground.

4262
04:09:47,899 --> 04:09:49,420
Underneath a tall, swaying tree.

4263
04:09:50,430 --> 04:09:52,110
There's a nagging pain in your leg.

4264
04:09:52,670 --> 04:09:55,950
And you look down to see a sapling growing up through your thigh.

4265
04:09:58,280 --> 04:09:59,399
Try to move.

4266
04:09:59,399 --> 04:10:03,629
You try to move away, but you are attached to the ground,

4267
04:10:04,190 --> 04:10:06,670
as though the roots of the sapling were your own tendons.

4268
04:10:07,709 --> 04:10:11,309
Through it all, you feel the heat of Anorland burning should your quest fail.

4269
04:10:11,309 --> 04:10:17,469
Sleep will not heal you if you have not eaten.

4270
04:10:17,469 --> 04:10:20,430
You ran out of provisions, entered the Citadel of Manpang,

4271
04:10:20,430 --> 04:10:22,750
and were cursed with the Zeb spell.

4272
04:10:22,750 --> 04:10:29,260
Still unaware.

4273
04:10:29,260 --> 04:10:31,739
You get quickly to your feet.

4274
04:10:32,299 --> 04:10:34,620
You've not been discovered, but you should not wait any longer.

4275
04:10:34,620 --> 04:10:49,200
Ladies and gentlemen, the mystery of Sorcery! Part 4 will continue for the time.

4276
04:10:49,200 --> 04:11:03,559
So we made it all the way through here, up to here.

4277
04:11:03,559 --> 04:11:04,360
There is...

4278
04:11:05,079 --> 04:11:06,680
Yeah, we're getting there.

4279
04:11:07,239 --> 04:11:12,909
There's still probably another four to six hours left, at least.

4280
04:11:12,909 --> 04:11:15,209
It'll probably take another two streams, maybe.

4281
04:11:22,010 --> 04:11:22,889
I know people saying,

4282
04:11:22,889 --> 04:11:26,809
Hey, why did you say this is one of your least favorite games in the series?

4283
04:11:26,809 --> 04:11:28,969
It's not really my least favorite game in the series,

4284
04:11:28,969 --> 04:11:36,350
but it's definitely the hardest.

4285
04:11:36,350 --> 04:11:38,270
I think I like them all for different reasons,

4286
04:11:38,270 --> 04:11:40,440
but I don't really hate...

4287
04:11:40,440 --> 04:11:41,479
I don't hate this one.

4288
04:11:41,479 --> 04:11:44,760
It's just, it's a little different, but it's fun.

4289
04:11:44,760 --> 04:11:45,639
I like it a lot.

4290
04:11:45,639 --> 04:11:48,750
Four to six hours? Really?

4291
04:11:48,750 --> 04:11:51,469
Yeah, you probably should add a one before both of those numbers.

4292
04:11:51,469 --> 04:11:52,909
It's probably gonna take like 10.

4293
04:11:52,909 --> 04:11:57,180
What's your least favorite?

4294
04:11:59,840 --> 04:12:02,959
I mean, technically, it's the same story.

4295
04:12:02,959 --> 04:12:03,600
It's not.

4296
04:12:03,600 --> 04:12:05,690
I mean, if you want to think of it like that.

4297
04:12:05,690 --> 04:12:09,319
But I guess they could...

4298
04:12:09,319 --> 04:12:11,959
They're kind of seasons of a TV show.

4299
04:12:11,959 --> 04:12:14,329
My favorite season is season two, right?

4300
04:12:14,329 --> 04:12:14,889
That's Kari.

4301
04:12:16,190 --> 04:12:20,489
Three and one are in the same space.

4302
04:12:20,489 --> 04:12:23,440
One is more like a giant tutorial.

4303
04:12:23,440 --> 04:12:25,870
And then four is the cleanup.

4304
04:12:25,870 --> 04:12:30,440
And four obviously gets rid of the rewind, which is kind of...

4305
04:12:30,440 --> 04:12:31,399
It's like, ah, shit.

4306
04:12:31,399 --> 04:12:34,040
If I make a mistake, I'm stuck with it.

4307
04:12:34,040 --> 04:12:37,399
But as you see, as we play through this, it becomes a little more...

4308
04:12:37,399 --> 04:12:41,280
It becomes a little different.

4309
04:12:41,280 --> 04:12:44,159
But yeah, that is going to be it for tonight.

4310
04:12:44,159 --> 04:12:44,719
I will see you.

4311
04:12:44,719 --> 04:12:45,920
I want to play Viewfinder.

4312
04:12:45,920 --> 04:12:47,850
So next stream will be Viewfinder.

4313
04:12:50,729 --> 04:12:53,530
I need to make a tweet for the YouToos.

4314
04:12:53,530 --> 04:12:56,590
What should I tweet?

4315
04:12:56,590 --> 04:12:57,309
What do you guys think?

4316
04:12:57,309 --> 04:12:58,760
What's a good tweet?

4317
04:12:58,760 --> 04:13:03,899
What do you think is a good tweet?

4318
04:13:03,899 --> 04:13:05,850
How about like...

4319
04:13:05,850 --> 04:13:08,889
Check it out!

4320
04:13:08,889 --> 04:13:18,639
You're never going to stream again.

4321
04:13:18,639 --> 04:13:20,649
I'll be back in like a few days.

4322
04:13:20,649 --> 04:13:22,829
Let's see.

4323
04:13:23,870 --> 04:13:28,139
Yeah, actually, let's shoot for this weekend.

4324
04:13:28,139 --> 04:13:29,530
That makes sense.

4325
04:13:29,530 --> 04:13:30,649
Like Saturday, Sunday.

4326
04:13:30,649 --> 04:13:33,049
Maybe like Friday, Saturday.

4327
04:13:33,049 --> 04:13:34,729
Just keep an eye on the sus.

4328
04:13:34,729 --> 04:13:36,889
In the next day or two, I'll come in and change it.

4329
04:13:36,889 --> 04:13:39,079
Somewhere in the next three or four days.

4330
04:13:39,079 --> 04:13:46,440
When is Sorcery 4 part two?

4331
04:13:46,440 --> 04:13:48,040
Now that I've actually started it,

4332
04:13:48,040 --> 04:13:50,920
I don't want to have it just sit here and not be done.

4333
04:13:50,920 --> 04:14:01,280
So I would imagine we'll go back to it probably next week.

4334
04:14:01,280 --> 04:14:04,670
Yeah, the YouToos is coming out on August 28th.

4335
04:14:04,670 --> 04:14:10,059
Grotto Beast, if you weren't here, let me show you this.

4336
04:14:10,059 --> 04:14:11,739
Because it is pretty damn cool.

4337
04:14:11,739 --> 04:14:12,780
Take a look at that.

4338
04:14:12,780 --> 04:14:15,229
That is the TTS mod.

4339
04:14:15,229 --> 04:14:17,129
It is almost done.

4340
04:14:17,129 --> 04:14:19,770
It's almost at a point where people can really play it.

4341
04:14:19,770 --> 04:14:22,510
And get in there and mess around in there.

4342
04:14:22,510 --> 04:14:30,489
If you didn't see some of the other pictures,

4343
04:14:30,489 --> 04:14:32,909
let's just go through them pretty quick.

4344
04:14:32,909 --> 04:14:34,510
It looks really, really cool.

4345
04:14:34,510 --> 04:14:41,280
I like the ring.

4346
04:14:41,280 --> 04:14:42,559
Like from the commercial.

4347
04:14:42,559 --> 04:14:44,280
They fight in the ring.

4348
04:14:44,280 --> 04:14:53,260
You actually play in the ring.

4349
04:14:53,260 --> 04:14:54,299
Yeah, it looks great.

4350
04:14:54,299 --> 04:14:54,940
I love it.

4351
04:14:54,940 --> 04:14:59,159
A lot of horses outside your house.

4352
04:14:59,159 --> 04:15:00,989
Yeah.

4353
04:15:00,989 --> 04:15:02,110
What is this exactly?

4354
04:15:02,750 --> 04:15:05,770
This is Grotto Beasts.

4355
04:15:05,770 --> 04:15:08,649
But this is a free standalone.

4356
04:15:08,649 --> 04:15:09,819
Well, that's not true.

4357
04:15:09,819 --> 04:15:12,299
It's a free mod for Tabletop Simulator.

4358
04:15:12,299 --> 04:15:15,420
I've had developers working on this.

4359
04:15:15,420 --> 04:15:17,659
And artists working on this for the last month or two.

4360
04:15:17,659 --> 04:15:20,540
Last two or three months.

4361
04:15:20,540 --> 04:15:22,670
And it's going to be available very soon.

4362
04:15:22,670 --> 04:15:24,989
It has all the Grotto Beast cards in it.

4363
04:15:24,989 --> 04:15:26,520
It is free.

4364
04:15:26,520 --> 04:15:30,909
Just for anybody that has Tabletop to just play it.

4365
04:15:30,909 --> 04:15:34,239
If they want to get in a group and have fun.

4366
04:15:34,239 --> 04:15:37,469
Once it gets a little closer, I'll probably...

4367
04:15:37,469 --> 04:15:38,590
I'll show it a little more.

4368
04:15:38,590 --> 04:15:45,120
You need to do that in a 1700s accent.

4369
04:15:45,120 --> 04:15:45,600
Okay.

4370
04:15:45,600 --> 04:15:49,520
So here we have the Grotto Beast Tournament.

4371
04:15:49,520 --> 04:15:52,879
The Grotto Beast Wrestling Tournament, as you see.

4372
04:15:52,879 --> 04:15:56,059
If you peer your eyes over to the left side of the screen,

4373
04:15:56,059 --> 04:15:57,579
you will see a fire.

4374
04:15:57,579 --> 04:15:58,459
That fire could be...

4375
04:16:00,090 --> 04:16:01,290
What could be in that fire?

4376
04:16:01,290 --> 04:16:04,120
Notice behind that, you see the cauldron.

4377
04:16:04,120 --> 04:16:07,719
And you see next to that, you see the frog launcher.

4378
04:16:07,719 --> 04:16:14,299
That's 1900s.

4379
04:16:14,299 --> 04:16:20,959
That's close enough.

4380
04:16:20,959 --> 04:16:26,350
That was a snake oil salesman from like 1880.

4381
04:16:26,350 --> 04:16:32,510
Or like 1890 or something.

4382
04:16:32,510 --> 04:16:32,829
All right.

4383
04:16:34,139 --> 04:16:35,500
I'm going to make a tweet for you two's.

4384
04:16:37,149 --> 04:16:39,229
It'll be up probably tonight or maybe tomorrow morning.

4385
04:16:39,229 --> 04:16:40,270
I might see if...

4386
04:16:40,270 --> 04:16:41,690
I might just put it up tomorrow morning.

4387
04:16:43,129 --> 04:16:44,729
Where more people will see it.

4388
04:16:44,729 --> 04:16:50,540
But yeah.

4389
04:16:50,540 --> 04:16:51,340
Take care.

4390
04:16:51,340 --> 04:16:52,079
See you soon.

4391
04:16:52,079 --> 04:16:52,719
Thanks for watching.

4392
04:16:52,719 --> 04:16:53,600
See you guys later this week.

4393
04:16:53,600 --> 04:16:54,399
Keep an eye on the sus.

4394
04:16:55,479 --> 04:16:57,719
I am going to briefly talk about this.

4395
04:16:57,719 --> 04:17:00,799
Because I don't want to confuse people.

4396
04:17:03,420 --> 04:17:05,739
In pre-stream, we talked about slowing down this year.

4397
04:17:06,809 --> 04:17:08,170
I know back in January...

4398
04:17:08,170 --> 04:17:10,920
Obviously back in June, I talked about this a little bit too.

4399
04:17:10,920 --> 04:17:20,940
But I'm getting close to starting a different kind of period of my online content life.

4400
04:17:20,940 --> 04:17:23,659
And I want to just briefly talk about it.

4401
04:17:23,659 --> 04:17:24,540
Because I don't...

4402
04:17:24,540 --> 04:17:27,260
This is not like, hey everybody, it's time to retire.

4403
04:17:28,489 --> 04:17:31,020
But soon.

4404
04:17:31,020 --> 04:17:34,299
I'm going to give you kind of what the plan is going to be.

4405
04:17:34,299 --> 04:17:37,200
Plan is obviously like once I started working at Offbrand.

4406
04:17:38,200 --> 04:17:38,920
That's going great.

4407
04:17:38,920 --> 04:17:39,959
I love that.

4408
04:17:39,959 --> 04:17:41,079
On a bunch of projects.

4409
04:17:41,319 --> 04:17:45,500
I've been clicking with the colleagues and all the other work.

4410
04:17:45,500 --> 04:17:46,959
It's been great.

4411
04:17:46,959 --> 04:17:51,159
But I really want to focus a lot on YouTube.

4412
04:17:51,159 --> 04:17:54,840
I want to get back to making original YouTube content.

4413
04:17:54,840 --> 04:18:00,280
I've talked a bunch of times about, hey, I have a video I'm working on.

4414
04:18:00,280 --> 04:18:00,760
I want to...

4415
04:18:00,760 --> 04:18:03,479
Hey, this video that I think is going to be really funny.

4416
04:18:03,479 --> 04:18:08,700
I really want to spend time on that kind of stuff.

4417
04:18:08,700 --> 04:18:10,780
But just the frequency is going to slow.

4418
04:18:11,899 --> 04:18:13,440
I mean, I'm getting older.

4419
04:18:13,440 --> 04:18:15,680
I need to start to get my health back in order.

4420
04:18:17,600 --> 04:18:20,569
I think it's just the right thing to do.

4421
04:18:20,569 --> 04:18:24,889
And I'm imagining over the next few months, you'll probably see a little bit less streaming

4422
04:18:24,889 --> 04:18:26,889
content and a little more YouTube stuff.

4423
04:18:29,260 --> 04:18:33,479
I'm calling it kind of a soft retirement.

4424
04:18:33,479 --> 04:18:35,719
Because it's not really...

4425
04:18:35,719 --> 04:18:37,079
I mean, it is, but it isn't.

4426
04:18:38,280 --> 04:18:40,360
I really want to do some more YouTube stuff.

4427
04:18:40,360 --> 04:18:42,760
Get a little bit further away from streaming.

4428
04:18:42,760 --> 04:18:54,329
And I have said many times that I want to make sure that you guys know when this is

4429
04:18:54,329 --> 04:18:58,489
happening so you understand the time frame.

4430
04:18:58,489 --> 04:19:02,250
Back in January of this year, I mentioned it a few times.

4431
04:19:02,250 --> 04:19:06,489
And I don't want to tell anybody, like, oh, hey, in January, I'm retiring.

4432
04:19:06,489 --> 04:19:08,030
Like, that's just...

4433
04:19:08,030 --> 04:19:08,510
I don't even...

4434
04:19:08,510 --> 04:19:09,629
You can't even call it that.

4435
04:19:09,629 --> 04:19:14,829
But I'm sticking around.

4436
04:19:14,829 --> 04:19:16,590
It's just going to change a little bit.

4437
04:19:16,590 --> 04:19:22,280
I'm going to condense a lot of my, I think, my social presence, like social media presence.

4438
04:19:22,280 --> 04:19:23,479
There's obviously...

4439
04:19:23,479 --> 04:19:25,399
Like, I barely even use my Twitter.

4440
04:19:25,399 --> 04:19:29,760
I don't even know what to even do with it anymore.

4441
04:19:29,760 --> 04:19:31,920
But I'm happy.

4442
04:19:31,920 --> 04:19:33,040
I'm really happy.

4443
04:19:33,040 --> 04:19:35,049
And honestly, I think that's the point.

4444
04:19:35,049 --> 04:19:37,739
The point is to drop the...

4445
04:19:37,739 --> 04:19:42,040
Maybe a little bit of my own internal pressure I've been putting on myself for the last three

4446
04:19:42,040 --> 04:19:51,360
or four years and just kind of go back to the way it was a long time ago.

4447
04:19:51,360 --> 04:19:54,360
I used to just make a YouTube video and I just felt like doing it.

4448
04:19:54,360 --> 04:19:55,930
And that's kind of the way it is.

4449
04:19:55,930 --> 04:20:01,739
And taking maybe some of the monetary aspect away from it, where I'm not...

4450
04:20:01,739 --> 04:20:02,299
I wouldn't...

4451
04:20:02,299 --> 04:20:03,819
I'm not streaming for money.

4452
04:20:04,809 --> 04:20:06,239
Money.

4453
04:20:06,239 --> 04:20:09,239
It's more so, I want to do something today.

4454
04:20:09,239 --> 04:20:10,600
And whatever that is, is what I'm going to do.

4455
04:20:16,409 --> 04:20:17,209
Money.

4456
04:20:17,209 --> 04:20:22,809
Somebody said that's how it should be.

4457
04:20:22,809 --> 04:20:24,489
It's been amazing.

4458
04:20:25,129 --> 04:20:27,290
I've had an incredible last 10 years.

4459
04:20:27,290 --> 04:20:29,959
12 years.

4460
04:20:29,959 --> 04:20:30,680
And it's not over.

4461
04:20:31,239 --> 04:20:34,280
I just want to make sure that I telegraph this.

4462
04:20:35,819 --> 04:20:36,860
Like back in June.

4463
04:20:36,860 --> 04:20:39,200
Like back in January of this year.

4464
04:20:39,200 --> 04:20:44,569
Just setting those expectations of, I'm going to turn it on when I feel like it.

4465
04:20:44,569 --> 04:20:46,409
When it's something I think it's fun to do.

4466
04:20:46,969 --> 04:20:48,889
Working on a bunch of projects at Offbrand.

4467
04:20:48,889 --> 04:20:52,879
Which is, again, I'm going to reiterate again, has been going very, very, very well.

4468
04:20:54,729 --> 04:20:55,209
Yeah.

4469
04:20:55,209 --> 04:20:58,399
Ro's telegraphing it like a market attack.

4470
04:21:00,159 --> 04:21:07,340
Oh no, he's turning into stone.

4471
04:21:07,899 --> 04:21:16,059
No, 2024 is kind of when this is all going to go into place, really.

4472
04:21:16,059 --> 04:21:20,219
So don't expect very many major changes this year.

4473
04:21:20,219 --> 04:21:23,479
But it's gonna start to be a thing.

4474
04:21:23,479 --> 04:21:28,280
The sus is going to just kind of be like, hey, maybe at the end of the week.

4475
04:21:28,280 --> 04:21:31,000
Maybe a few days from now.

4476
04:21:31,000 --> 04:21:39,239
And it's kind of interesting because, I'll give you a little bit of real talk here.

4477
04:21:39,319 --> 04:21:43,159
Back before Dollhouse.

4478
04:21:43,159 --> 04:21:47,399
I was thinking about this before Dollhouse.

4479
04:21:47,399 --> 04:21:48,920
And then I did Dollhouse.

4480
04:21:48,920 --> 04:21:51,899
And I was like, holy shit, I want to do it.

4481
04:21:51,899 --> 04:21:53,659
I want to do like way more of that.

4482
04:21:53,659 --> 04:21:55,760
I want to do that.

4483
04:21:55,760 --> 04:21:56,159
Can I do?

4484
04:21:56,159 --> 04:21:58,319
How many more of those can I physically do?

4485
04:21:58,319 --> 04:21:59,840
How do I do that again?

4486
04:22:01,469 --> 04:22:03,629
And that reignited a lot of the spark, obviously.

4487
04:22:04,909 --> 04:22:09,549
And again, let me, it's, this is not me telling you that I don't like streaming anymore.

4488
04:22:09,549 --> 04:22:17,899
I'm just starting to see a different sort of pivot path of focus a little bit more on YouTube.

4489
04:22:17,899 --> 04:22:20,040
Pull back a little bit on live.

4490
04:22:20,040 --> 04:22:21,719
And be working at off-brand.

4491
04:22:21,719 --> 04:22:26,649
Did you say, did you already say this?

4492
04:22:26,649 --> 04:22:28,250
Yeah, I've said it a few times.

4493
04:22:28,250 --> 04:22:37,020
I have said this a few times.

4494
04:22:37,020 --> 04:22:41,899
But something that's important to remember about me kind of repeating myself on this.

4495
04:22:41,899 --> 04:22:45,629
I want to make sure the most amount of people hear this.

4496
04:22:45,629 --> 04:22:51,389
And something about doing videos and streaming is, I'm talking to you guys right now.

4497
04:22:51,389 --> 04:22:54,909
But a week from now, there's 9,000 people here.

4498
04:22:54,909 --> 04:22:58,459
There might be 8,000 different people.

4499
04:22:58,459 --> 04:23:01,979
So it's kind of, I want to just kind of make sure that people are aware.

4500
04:23:01,979 --> 04:23:07,959
That is something that's going to be happening over the next three to six months.

4501
04:23:07,959 --> 04:23:09,690
He hates us.

4502
04:23:09,690 --> 04:23:17,389
No, that is not the case.

4503
04:23:17,389 --> 04:23:20,989
And seeing like the YouTube stuff is, I don't know.

4504
04:23:20,989 --> 04:23:25,280
You kind of look at it and you go, oh shit, okay.

4505
04:23:25,280 --> 04:23:30,569
This is a, that's like, that's dollhouse.

4506
04:23:30,569 --> 04:23:31,370
Okay, that's cool.

4507
04:23:34,920 --> 04:23:35,559
We get it, we get it.

4508
04:23:35,559 --> 04:23:36,920
Somebody said, I get it, I get it.

4509
04:23:36,920 --> 04:23:38,040
You need to live your life.

4510
04:23:38,040 --> 04:23:43,709
Well, I'm not going to stop streaming.

4511
04:23:43,709 --> 04:23:45,790
I hope that's what you're getting from this.

4512
04:23:45,790 --> 04:23:48,319
I'm not stopping.

4513
04:23:48,319 --> 04:23:55,229
It's just changing and slowing down.

4514
04:23:55,229 --> 04:23:58,200
What could reignite you again?

4515
04:23:58,200 --> 04:23:59,159
Already happened.

4516
04:23:59,159 --> 04:24:01,360
It's already happening.

4517
04:24:01,360 --> 04:24:04,399
Working on shows, working with other content creators.

4518
04:24:04,399 --> 04:24:07,280
I mean, look at the Rambush.

4519
04:24:07,280 --> 04:24:09,079
That was a Rambush show.

4520
04:24:09,079 --> 04:24:12,430
That was, it's like, that was fucking fun.

4521
04:24:12,430 --> 04:24:14,190
And got to be a part of that.

4522
04:24:14,190 --> 04:24:16,430
And I got to help create concepts for it.

4523
04:24:16,430 --> 04:24:18,270
And I was like, I acted in it.

4524
04:24:18,270 --> 04:24:22,319
And it was a lot of fun.

4525
04:24:22,319 --> 04:24:23,600
Don't set him on fire.

4526
04:24:26,090 --> 04:24:29,850
Three or four years ago, I think even before, maybe right after dollhouse, I think I said

4527
04:24:29,850 --> 04:24:32,090
that, man, doing that is fun.

4528
04:24:32,090 --> 04:24:34,090
And I would love to be on part of like a creative team.

4529
04:24:34,729 --> 04:24:47,180
It's hard when you say not stopping and then you use the word retiring.

4530
04:24:47,180 --> 04:24:50,280
Well, soft retiring.

4531
04:24:50,280 --> 04:24:53,440
It's because I'm not just going to leave.

4532
04:24:53,440 --> 04:24:54,879
It's like, OK, guys, that's enough.

4533
04:24:54,879 --> 04:24:55,760
I'm done streaming.

4534
04:24:55,760 --> 04:24:56,639
See you later.

4535
04:24:56,639 --> 04:24:58,239
And then I never turn the stream on ever again.

4536
04:24:58,239 --> 04:24:59,200
That's not going to happen.

4537
04:24:59,200 --> 04:25:01,229
Just far less.

4538
04:25:04,649 --> 04:25:10,219
Semi-retired.

4539
04:25:10,219 --> 04:25:12,760
What about one last job?

4540
04:25:12,760 --> 04:25:15,319
One last job, Arthur.

4541
04:25:15,319 --> 04:25:18,280
How about like 50 last jobs, Arthur?

4542
04:25:22,799 --> 04:25:29,209
Why are you tentative about this?

4543
04:25:30,879 --> 04:25:34,590
Because I've been around for a really long time.

4544
04:25:34,590 --> 04:25:35,790
And I want to make sure I get it right.

4545
04:25:35,790 --> 04:25:37,950
And I want to make sure it's truly what I really want to do.

4546
04:25:37,950 --> 04:25:41,530
It's been a very long time.

4547
04:25:41,530 --> 04:25:49,739
I have heard from some of you guys before that you're you graduated college and you

4548
04:25:49,739 --> 04:25:52,860
started watching me when you were like 13.

4549
04:25:55,879 --> 04:25:56,360
What?

4550
04:25:56,360 --> 04:25:57,559
Like, no way.

4551
04:25:57,559 --> 04:25:59,440
It's been a long time.

4552
04:25:59,440 --> 04:26:01,280
I just want to make sure I'm doing this right.

4553
04:26:01,280 --> 04:26:03,549
So we're going to do it slow.

4554
04:26:03,549 --> 04:26:05,950
I'm going to make sure I'm doing it the way that I really want to.

4555
04:26:05,950 --> 04:26:09,879
And I'll see you later this week.

4556
04:26:09,879 --> 04:26:12,219
That's not changing.

4557
04:26:12,219 --> 04:26:12,940
Don't worry.

4558
04:26:12,940 --> 04:26:19,680
What did I say in pre-stream earlier?

4559
04:26:20,079 --> 04:26:22,479
I said, what did I not do yet?

4560
04:26:22,479 --> 04:26:23,280
Oh, that's right.

4561
04:26:23,280 --> 04:26:26,430
The Elden Ring DLC has not come out yet.

4562
04:26:26,430 --> 04:26:28,590
I can't leave.

4563
04:26:28,590 --> 04:26:29,389
I cannot leave.

4564
04:26:29,950 --> 04:26:53,040
Elden Ring DLC is not out.

4565
04:26:53,040 --> 04:26:55,600
It said, auction off your channel when you retire.

4566
04:26:56,729 --> 04:26:57,930
No, I'm not.

4567
04:26:57,930 --> 04:26:59,610
That's not going to happen.

4568
04:26:59,610 --> 04:27:11,180
But I don't want to talk in circles about it.

4569
04:27:12,250 --> 04:27:16,489
But just know that it's something that's floating around in my brain.

4570
04:27:16,489 --> 04:27:18,250
And YouTube stuff.

4571
04:27:18,250 --> 04:27:19,610
I want to make some YouTube videos.

4572
04:27:19,610 --> 04:27:20,409
I want to.

4573
04:27:20,409 --> 04:27:22,809
Look, I might even go live on YouTube.

4574
04:27:23,370 --> 04:27:25,770
I might turn the stream on on YouTube.

4575
04:27:28,040 --> 04:27:28,760
I don't know.

4576
04:27:28,760 --> 04:27:30,280
That's really possible.

4577
04:27:30,280 --> 04:27:30,760
We'll see.

4578
04:27:32,600 --> 04:27:33,399
I don't know.

4579
04:27:33,399 --> 04:27:35,069
Maybe I'll just do it one day.

4580
04:27:35,069 --> 04:27:41,450
I talked in pre-stream about how, like, just doing stuff for no reason that I thought would be funny for a minute.

4581
04:27:41,450 --> 04:27:43,770
In that soft retirement, I was going to do it.

4582
04:27:43,770 --> 04:27:52,200
YouTube live.

4583
04:27:52,200 --> 04:27:52,700
Bald.

4584
04:27:53,610 --> 04:27:54,729
Oh, no, you said bad.

4585
04:27:54,729 --> 04:27:55,370
Okay.

4586
04:27:55,370 --> 04:28:04,920
I thought you were calling me bald.

4587
04:28:04,920 --> 04:28:05,239
All right.

4588
04:28:05,239 --> 04:28:06,280
I'll see you guys later.

4589
04:28:06,280 --> 04:28:08,969
I know.

4590
04:28:08,969 --> 04:28:09,690
I don't.

4591
04:28:09,690 --> 04:28:15,610
Every three or four months, I've been like, hey, you know, slow down and, you know, chilling out with streams.

4592
04:28:15,610 --> 04:28:17,129
And now this face cam.

4593
04:28:18,010 --> 04:28:20,860
I just want to make sure people know because people pay money to this channel.

4594
04:28:22,000 --> 04:28:23,600
People pay money to this channel.

4595
04:28:23,600 --> 04:28:24,799
I want you to be very aware.

4596
04:28:26,360 --> 04:28:27,559
And stuff like subs.

4597
04:28:29,000 --> 04:28:33,399
I'm not going to encourage that going forward here in the next few months.

4598
04:28:33,399 --> 04:28:33,559
Right?

4599
04:28:33,559 --> 04:28:36,920
Like, I'm not going to be like, oh, hey, um, for the subs.

4600
04:28:36,920 --> 04:28:43,420
Like, no, I, I, I used to treat it the same way as, you know, I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing.

4601
04:28:51,600 --> 04:28:51,840
Yeah.

4602
04:28:51,840 --> 04:28:56,719
Even in what I, in what I'm describing, even if I didn't have partner, I would still just

4603
04:28:56,719 --> 04:28:58,000
stream when I felt like it.

4604
04:28:58,000 --> 04:28:58,639
So don't worry.

4605
04:29:00,479 --> 04:29:02,360
It's not about the money.

4606
04:29:03,079 --> 04:29:03,959
It's about streaming.

4607
04:29:04,680 --> 04:29:05,159
For fun.

4608
04:29:05,959 --> 04:29:08,219
Batman.

4609
04:29:08,860 --> 04:29:16,569
All right.

4610
04:29:16,569 --> 04:29:18,489
I don't, I don't, I don't want to keep talking about it.

4611
04:29:18,489 --> 04:29:20,569
I don't want to keep making people be like, wait, what the fuck is happening?

4612
04:29:20,569 --> 04:29:21,610
Is he, what's he's coming?

4613
04:29:21,610 --> 04:29:22,250
He's gone tomorrow.

4614
04:29:22,250 --> 04:29:23,450
He's literally retiring tomorrow.

4615
04:29:27,370 --> 04:29:31,370
I will see you guys on Friday or Saturday of this week.

4616
04:29:31,370 --> 04:29:40,040
See you soon.

4617
04:29:40,760 --> 04:29:42,440
See you on Friday or Saturday.

4618
04:29:43,079 --> 04:29:44,360
Goodbye.

4619
04:29:44,360 --> 04:29:45,159
Take care of yourselves.

4620
04:29:45,719 --> 04:29:46,680
Call your mother.

4621
04:29:46,680 --> 04:29:47,319
Call your father.

4622
04:29:48,040 --> 04:29:49,370
You know what?

4623
04:29:49,370 --> 04:29:54,639
Just like have a nice, like have a nice hour where you're just like lounging around at

4624
04:29:54,639 --> 04:29:56,879
some point today, tomorrow, next day.

4625
04:29:56,879 --> 04:29:59,559
Take care.

4626
04:30:00,510 --> 04:30:01,870
See you soon.
