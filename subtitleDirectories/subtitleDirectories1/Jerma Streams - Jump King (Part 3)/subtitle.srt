1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:14,619
I just want to try it. I'm just going to try it. I'm just going to try it. Just a little bit.

2
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:21,579
I just want to see what it looks like. I just want to see what it looks like. I just want to test it.

3
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:25,579
I'm just going to test it. God, it's been six hours. I'm just going to test it out.

4
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:50,210
Ah, I just want to test it.

5
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:55,210
Other babes. Ghost of the Babe, New Babe Plus. Which one is it?

6
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:00,090
Oh shit, I have to do window capture.

7
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:11,719
Oh right, because it's fucked up. I forgot.

8
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:16,390
Alright, hold on. Be right back.

9
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,390
Is this going to be my first 16 hour stream? No, it is not. It is not going to be that.

10
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,390
Where's window capture?

11
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:32,659
Where's window capture? I need to do this now. Let's go.

12
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:43,409
It's not going to be 17 hours.

13
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:53,859
There we go. Alright, let's go.

14
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:56,859
What is it? New Babe Plus? Which one is it?

15
00:01:56,859 --> 00:02:07,170
Ghost of the Babe?

16
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,169
No, what? Continue?

17
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:20,810
Ghost of the Babe. Are you sure? Delete, save, or no?

18
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,810
This is worded very strangely. Continue.

19
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:33,729
Now, let me see if I can remember how to play.

20
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:49,870
Alright, it's going to take me a minute to remember how to play.

21
00:02:49,870 --> 00:03:22,449
Alright, I remember. I remember. I remember.

22
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:27,379
Okay, I don't...

23
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,919
No, I gotta eat food and then do this. No, alright.

24
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,919
No, no, no, no. No, no, no. No, it's too late.

25
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:38,919
It's like I have to stop right now before this gets any worse.

26
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:41,289
I have to stop before this gets any worse.

27
00:03:41,289 --> 00:04:05,879
Oops. Okay. I fucked up. It's alright. I can't even get to the DLC yet.

28
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:09,879
Yeah, I played this game like fucking two weeks ago. I haven't played it since.

29
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,879
I've been dreaming about it.

30
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:35,649
He's obsessed with it. I'm not obsessed with it.

31
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:42,500
Alright. You know, it's alright.

32
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,120
Alright, I'll see you tomorrow. I'll see you tomorrow. I have to stop this now.

33
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,120
I know what's going to happen and this is going to be bad.

34
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:56,310
I'll see you tomorrow. I'll see you tomorrow. Somebody get me.

35
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,310
Somebody get me now. Somebody come get me.

36
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,730
Come get me. Somebody come get me.

37
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,730
Come get me. Somebody come get me.

38
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:19,060
He's trapped. No, I'm not.

39
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,060
I'm just trying to... I want to get to the DLC and save it there.

40
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,100
I just want to get to the DLC and save it there and that's it.

41
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,100
And that's it. And then I'll be done.

42
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:52,740
I just want to get to the DLC and then we'll take a look.

43
00:05:52,740 --> 00:06:03,490
We'll just take a look when we get there.

44
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:12,790
Oops. Oops. It's okay. It's alright. Fine.

45
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:19,189
It's alright. I'm just... I gotta get...

46
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:20,189
Coin? I don't care.

47
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:22,189
Coin has nothing to do with the DLC.

48
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:26,290
Alright, I gotta get this one right. I gotta get that.

49
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,290
It's been pretty smooth so far.

50
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,290
No major fuck ups. Just getting back in the swing of things.

51
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:40,779
I fucked it up. It's alright.

52
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:42,779
Oh man. I fucked it up. I have to go.

53
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:55,199
Alright. I have to leave. Like right now.

54
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:04,800
Somebody come get me.

55
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Somebody come get me.

56
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:13,100
I'm trying to go so fast just to get to the...

57
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,100
I just want to get to the DLC and then I'll be done.

58
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:20,019
Seriously. It's not even that hard.

59
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:22,709
It's not. I'm just like brushing and freaking out.

60
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:32,180
I want to do it though.

61
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,180
Alright. Slow down.

62
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,180
I've already beat the damn game. Who cares?

63
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,870
Alright. Let's go. Let's go.

64
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,870
No more fucking around.

65
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,180
Just get up there.

66
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,180
He's addicted?

67
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,180
I mean the game is fucking incredibly fun to play.

68
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,180
Didn't I say I hated this game?

69
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,180
I talked about how I hated everything about this game.

70
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,660
I think I did that.

71
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:59,220
Show this to future Jeremy.

72
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,220
Let me see.

73
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,740
This is important.

74
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,819
I think I'm gonna go get that coin.

75
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,819
Can I like fucking scoop slam him and take over his place?

76
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:09,819
I don't understand.

77
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:20,529
Like I don't care if I'm the new Jeremy.

78
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:23,529
Jeremy, if you're listening to me in the future, just come do it and be the Jeremy.

79
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:24,529
That's fine.

80
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:29,389
I don't get it.

81
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:33,269
I am me. I am the future me.

82
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:34,269
What's he talking about?

83
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:38,110
I don't get it.

84
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:43,100
I just need to get to the DLC and save the game.

85
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,100
And then I'll never open the game again.

86
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,100
I will never open this game again.

87
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,100
I just have to get to the DLC and then turn it off.

88
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,100
Alright. Let's go.

89
00:08:50,100 --> 00:09:11,500
Oops.

90
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,600
Alright. Let's do it.

91
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,039
Alright. Is that a full jump?

92
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:21,879
I don't remember.

93
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:22,879
It's been a while.

94
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:27,190
It is. Okay.

95
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,190
Okay.

96
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:34,809
Just get into the DLC.

97
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:53,440
Not a big deal.

98
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,440
Don't worry.

99
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,440
It's not a big deal.

100
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
Not a big deal.

101
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,440
That's the first time.

102
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:12,700
Oh, God.

103
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,700
I've attempted that before.

104
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:24,740
It's the first time I've attempted that in a long time.

105
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:37,710
I haven't attempted that in a long time, guys.

106
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,710
Fix the stream name.

107
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:42,899
This is not a Jump King stream.

108
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:43,899
I don't need to change the title.

109
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:45,460
I'm just sampling.

110
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,460
Don't.

111
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,460
Okay.

112
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:58,940
I have stuff talking.

113
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,940
Alright.

114
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,940
Fucking I'll change the title name.

115
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,940
Fine.

116
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,940
Jeez.

117
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,940
Alright.

118
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,940
Here we go.

119
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:11,690
Title name is just testing out the DLC.

120
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:14,690
And then that's it.

121
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:15,690
Is it Jump King?

122
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,690
Does it say Jump King?

123
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:34,440
What are you talking about?

124
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,000
We're good?

125
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Time for the DLC.

126
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Let's go.

127
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'll try it once.

128
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Just to look at it.

129
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I just want to test it.

130
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,909
Okay.

131
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:47,909
Let's test out the DLC.

132
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:48,909
Just give it a look.

133
00:11:48,909 --> 00:12:01,220
Okay.

134
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,220
Let's give it a look.

135
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:12,590
Let's just give it a quick little look.

136
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:21,490
Let me get right here.

137
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,620
Looks good.

138
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,620
Just give it a look.

139
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,620
Okay.

140
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,620
Let him look bad.

141
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,620
Looks pretty good.

142
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,570
Alright.

143
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:42,129
Cool.

144
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,620
Easy.

145
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,549
This way, right?

146
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:48,980
Yep.

147
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,980
Give it a look.

148
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,980
I remember I did a little bit of this.

149
00:12:51,980 --> 00:13:05,129
A little bit more.

150
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:06,129
Just give it a look.

151
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:09,879
Just a fun little six hour look.

152
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:11,879
I'm not going to do that guys.

153
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:14,210
Alright.

154
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,210
I gotta slow down.

155
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:29,759
It's just.

156
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:30,759
Alright.

157
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:31,759
I'm good.

158
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:32,759
We're fine.

159
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:33,759
Everyone just relax.

160
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:34,759
Have a good New Year.

161
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:36,759
Hope you had a good New Year's Eve.

162
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:44,980
Okay.

163
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,980
We're back.

164
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,980
Good.

165
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,980
Bro.

166
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,789
2020 sucks.

167
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:50,789
I'm sorry.

168
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:51,789
I'm really sorry to hear that.

169
00:13:51,789 --> 00:14:02,120
Hopefully 2020 gets better.

170
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,120
Oops.

171
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,120
I didn't see.

172
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:10,929
I didn't know they had a top.

173
00:14:10,929 --> 00:14:11,929
Get birdy.

174
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:14,509
You're going to lose.

175
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:16,460
That's not true.

176
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,460
Is that true?

177
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,460
Wait.

178
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:29,730
Stop getting in my head.

179
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,730
Fuck.

180
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:31,730
God damn it.

181
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,730
You're still streaming this shit.

182
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,730
No.

183
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:34,730
I'm not.

184
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:35,730
This is not a real stream.

185
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:36,730
It's not a real stream.

186
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:37,730
This is a.

187
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:42,730
I'm just trying to test out what I think about the DLC content.

188
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:46,179
If this was a real stream, you would know.

189
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:54,700
Because I'd be like, you know.

190
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,700
Yeah, I tested it.

191
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,700
I did.

192
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,659
Yeah.

193
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:00,659
And it's fine.

194
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:08,179
It seems like it's pretty cool.

195
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:09,179
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

196
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:10,179
No, I just want to fucking test it.

197
00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:11,179
I just want to.

198
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:12,179
I just want to test it.

199
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:31,399
I am sort.

200
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:33,600
I'm kind of in the zone with the game at the moment, though.

201
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,799
I will tell you.

202
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:46,840
What?

203
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,840
No, stop distracting me.

204
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,840
Don't distract me.

205
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,840
Why are you distracting me like this?

206
00:15:49,840 --> 00:16:02,090
Why?

207
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,090
Stop distracting me.

208
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:10,220
Everyone's distracting me.

209
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,220
Stop.

210
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,220
Just don't distract me.

211
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:23,299
Fuck.

212
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:24,299
OK.

213
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:27,840
People are distracting me.

214
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,840
I got to turn.

215
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,840
OK.

216
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:45,799
You know what I got to do?

217
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:46,799
I got to turn on.

218
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:47,799
Slow down.

219
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,230
I got here before.

220
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,230
I've been here before.

221
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,230
Emote only?

222
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:58,039
No.

223
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:59,039
I just have to stop looking over the screen.

224
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:14,099
I forgot there was ice in the video game.

225
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,099
All right.

226
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:27,420
We're good.

227
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,420
That's a pretty good test.

228
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,960
Not a bad test.

229
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,960
Close the game now.

230
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,329
No, it's all good.

231
00:17:34,329 --> 00:17:35,329
I'm all right.

232
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:48,470
I just want to keep testing some things.

233
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,470
Don't go that far.

234
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:57,880
I got to go shorter than that.

235
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:17,380
I went fucking around when I told you guys I was like, dreamed about this game.

236
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:22,710
What?

237
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,710
Come on.

238
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:27,450
I can do this.

239
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,450
What time is it?

240
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,450
It's 11 o'clock?

241
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,450
It's not that late.

242
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:35,079
Oh, my God.

243
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:36,079
What did I do that for?

244
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:41,160
Oh, my God.

245
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,359
Oh, my God.

246
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,359
Oh, my God.

247
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,359
Oh, my God.

248
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,359
Oh, my God.

249
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,359
All right.

250
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:52,700
You guys are distracting me.

251
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,700
You guys are distracting the fuck out of me.

252
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,700
Everyone's just yelling my name and shit.

253
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,980
I'm in trouble now.

254
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,980
OK.

255
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:13,740
Here we go.

256
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,069
All right.

257
00:19:16,069 --> 00:19:21,730
We're fine.

258
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:26,549
I'm back.

259
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:28,430
There we go.

260
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,430
OK.

261
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:41,549
Thank you for the non-distractions.

262
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:48,490
I appreciate it.

263
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,259
All right.

264
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:52,440
We're good.

265
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,440
What time is it?

266
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,440
It's been six hours.

267
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,940
It's not like...

268
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,940
You guys act like it's been 30 hours.

269
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,940
It's only been like six hours.

270
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:04,359
All right.

271
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:05,359
Not too crazy here.

272
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:06,359
There we go.

273
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:07,920
All right.

274
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,920
What's up here?

275
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,289
What should I do about this?

276
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:11,289
Bounce off this wall?

277
00:20:11,289 --> 00:20:13,299
Wait.

278
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:14,299
No.

279
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:14,319
From here.
