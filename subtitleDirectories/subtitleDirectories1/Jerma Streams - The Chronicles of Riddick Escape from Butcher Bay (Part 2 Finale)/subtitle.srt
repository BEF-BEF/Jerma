1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,219
I hadn't even been in 10 sec, people are already punching me. Did you see that?

2
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:12,419
I turn the stream on, I just see, get him, and people punching.

3
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:17,719
How you doing guys? Welcome back. Welcome to part two

4
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:24,809
of the Chronicles of Riddick Escape from Butcher's Bay.

5
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:29,179
This is a two-part series. I plan on finishing this tonight. I think we're

6
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:33,579
fairly close to... somebody said I'm more than halfway

7
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:37,429
through the game. Uh, probably like 60% of the way through

8
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:42,649
the game. Probably have another three or four hours. Freddy Dread coming in

9
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:47,859
with 50 community subs. Just, he just throws rocks full of money.

10
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:53,799
He just throws eggs filled with money, not egg yolk, at the stream.

11
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:59,270
It's a lot. Freddy, you continue to fucking... Freddy,

12
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:04,950
Freddy sometimes comes to Vegas. Like, Freddy, if we go out somewhere,

13
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:09,450
if like we hang out, if you come to Vegas eventually, like,

14
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:18,040
like, don't, you ain't buying shit, okay? Like, if we go to... I'm not, and I'll

15
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,510
tell you this, I will take you to Denny's and out,

16
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:26,150
you can get anything you want on the Denny's menu, I promise you that.

17
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,510
At least twice. We'll go to Denny's twice, and you can get anything on the whole

18
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:36,219
menu. He's already paid for it all. You already

19
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:39,980
paid for it all a hundred times. He could, he could probably

20
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:48,939
own the franchise of this Denny's that I'm talking about.

21
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:53,739
No, but seriously, dude, you, you, you've gone above and beyond what anyone would

22
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:58,500
ever be expected to give a single person on the internet any amount of money.

23
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:06,390
Like, times of million. So, thanks. And if you ever come to Vegas,

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,509
that offer stands.

25
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:17,979
You're my, I shaved my head. All right, well, it's hot out. That's not a bad idea.

26
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:28,500
Get him. Uh, Grove Coaster just gave a hundred and forty-five dollars.

27
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,659
Not, not for Freddy to be, to be a hundred and forty-five dollars in bits.

28
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:39,460
What are you doing? That's a lot of money. That's too much money.

29
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,500
And they, they just said, I defended my master thesis

30
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:48,250
fifteen minutes ago. Thanks for being here. Like, like a debate?

31
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:54,379
Holy shit. That's a lot of money. Thank you. Did I change my microphone?

32
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:59,340
No, I sound weird. I shouldn't. Unless I fucked something up.

33
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,740
The microphone's closer to my mouth. So, I mean, do I sound like I'm too close to

34
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,740
you? Do I sound like I'm way too close to you?

35
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:16,460
Should I back up a little? Did you get the standing desk? No, I

36
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:21,110
didn't. I did not. Here's my problem with the

37
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:25,319
standing desk. So, last year or like a year and a half

38
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:29,479
ago, I got this really nice, you've seen it, the, my

39
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:34,979
like nice walnut desk. And this thing was kind of expensive

40
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:38,810
and I want to use it, but so it just sucks where it's like, oh,

41
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:43,240
well, shit, what do I do with this? What can I put this somewhere else? I have to

42
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:53,530
get like a whole new desk now. Yeah, let's get it as a second desk. So,

43
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,009
the idea is, me and Kim were talking about it and I'm

44
00:03:56,009 --> 00:04:01,770
probably gonna move this one out in a space where she could kind of

45
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,050
use it as a little, like, area where she can do some work

46
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:08,090
and stuff. So, that's probably the plan and I'm gonna get a standing desk.

47
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:15,139
You don't need a standing desk, just get up occasionally. Yeah, but I, you know me.

48
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:18,420
I'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna be sitting here just fucking screaming at a

49
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:22,980
2004, like, 10-year-old video game. I'm not, I'm not gonna remember to, like,

50
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,100
stand up every 15 minutes and I don't want to, like, just

51
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,699
have that in the back of my mind. Stand up every 20 minutes, stand up every 20

52
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,300
minutes, I won't, it's just gonna fuck me up.

53
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:37,319
So, I might as well just stand the whole time. 2004 was 16 years ago.

54
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,680
I don't even, let me say these things. It's,

55
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:47,050
I know. All right, does anybody here feel like,

56
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:53,879
that every year has been, like, 2015? Like, it's just 20, like, it's just 2013

57
00:04:53,879 --> 00:05:00,680
every year, right? I just feel like it's 2013.

58
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,620
This, we've not gone past it. The world is passing me by

59
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:16,569
and I'm just in 2013. Like, I just uploaded, like, Dramarumble 3. No, that was

60
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:27,129
fucking seven years ago. That's so much time.

61
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:30,569
How many, that's how, that so much time has passed

62
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:35,139
in seven years. What happened, what have I been doing? Have I, have I, okay, let me

63
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:37,699
ask you this. Have I, like, have I done anything in seven

64
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:46,199
years? I think I have. I feel like I've done a lot of things.

65
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:51,990
Yeah, I think I have, maybe. A little. I did the carnival.

66
00:05:51,990 --> 00:06:01,850
Well, yeah, that was cool. Oh, yeah. Also, this is going to be an

67
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,569
interesting stream because I just realized something.

68
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:07,769
So, I woke up a little bit tight this morning and

69
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:12,889
I, I did, I took a, I took a little bit of tips of pain reducing potentials

70
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:18,019
CBD and this might be a CBD stream. I just want to make that very clear so

71
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:20,259
people don't yell at me when I can't open the door

72
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:25,129
for, like, the third time in a row. I was, I didn't want to cancel the stream

73
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:27,689
because I want to obviously finish this and I want to play and I want to stream

74
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:31,290
so I, you know, it's legal in the, in the United

75
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:35,930
States of Las Vegas where I am here and in this, in this area and I

76
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:41,000
am all right. Didn't, I took just a little bit so

77
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,610
I took, I take it for pain. Those of you that don't know.

78
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:54,009
Washed up drug streamer. Like, like, three milligrams of CBD and THC

79
00:06:54,009 --> 00:07:00,470
for pain. I do not put that in that category, okay?

80
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,889
Anyways, we're gonna play This is Butcher's Bay. He's got wicked low

81
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:15,670
weed tolerance. By the way, why is that a bad thing?

82
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,790
You, you do realize that being able to, like, feel

83
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:25,139
better and feel good at, like, three to four milligrams?

84
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:29,379
I know some people that, like, are, like, they, they're, like, fucking doing, like,

85
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:33,110
20, 15 and they built up such a tolerance. That,

86
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,629
that's an expensive tolerance. Low tolerance, inexpensive is what you meant

87
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:44,730
to say. Remember, the gateway from CBD is to CBT.

88
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,459
Read that one out loud. Good. Pick them, pick that one

89
00:07:48,459 --> 00:08:00,139
to read. It's only been eight minutes. Joe Rogan. No, I,

90
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:02,779
all right, I shouldn't have even said anything, but, like, I, it's almost like I

91
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:05,980
have to, like, preliminarily defend myself

92
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,939
when I, like, make a bunch of mistakes in the game. But, like, that doesn't matter

93
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:12,300
because I do that anyways. So, it's, it's just gonna be a regular

94
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,339
ass Jeremy stream, right? Like, I'm not gonna be able to remember

95
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:19,019
where the door is and I'm trying to, like, give, like, a thing to blame.

96
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:23,420
So, like, you know that now, so you can blame that. But I did that yesterday.

97
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:31,480
All right, let's go. You ready? Right where we left off,

98
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:37,139
uh, we had this dude here. We had to go get a bomb for this guy.

99
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:40,100
And just in case somebody missed it yesterday, I'll show you. I'll just

100
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,059
welcome, I'll show you. No, I'm not gonna do that. I was gonna punch him in the

101
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:45,139
face. I'm gonna punch him in the face. Just

102
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:49,220
the new audience can tell. Like that, like, you can do that.

103
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:55,460
Okay. How do I turn, all right. So, those of you that are wondering about this game,

104
00:08:55,539 --> 00:09:00,169
um, you can see in the dark. Although, seeing in the dark just looks like

105
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:04,149
you're looking through a really expensive vase.

106
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:09,659
So, like, I have a piece of quartz up to my eye. All right.

107
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:17,750
I have to go back, right? Let me see. He wants me to go

108
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:23,029
get bomb. Go to tower 19 and get a bomb. To get to tower 19, head back from the

109
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,509
mining core up to the mine entrance, then use

110
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:28,470
Jagger's code to activate the elevator. All right, we have to go back to that

111
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:38,379
original elevator. I almost pressed that. What do I have?

112
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:44,340
Oh yeah, I have weapons. Don't adjust your monitor. Do not adjust

113
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,899
your screen. You're probably messing with the tent and

114
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:49,830
shit. Don't do that. The game is very ugly.

115
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:56,059
I promise it's not your screen. It's mine. Wait. Yes.

116
00:09:56,059 --> 00:10:03,059
Yes. No. Yes. I was fucking with the tent, dad.

117
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:15,960
I just told you not to do that. It's not your screen. It's mine.

118
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:22,460
Uh, the game's kind of loud. I'm gonna turn the game down.

119
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:36,120
Fix my screen? Oh, no. That's you. You're making a joke. Okay.

120
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,679
Uh, all right. I gotta go back up. We're gonna go in the elevator. We're gonna

121
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:43,100
get a bomb from tower. I remember tower 19. It's where the it's in the

122
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:49,289
oops. Why does it look like sewer sludge is covering the screen?

123
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:53,740
Because this game is very, very, very ugly.

124
00:10:53,740 --> 00:11:00,309
Now, I didn't say this is a bad game. This game is actually pretty fun, but it's

125
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:11,879
incredibly ugly. It's not ugly at all, to be honest. Well,

126
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:16,519
you'll see. This is only like a third of the game is

127
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:30,440
walking around with lights on. Most of the game looks like this. Oh,

128
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:39,659
we got two clubs here. Boom. Boomer. Wrong way. I think he's high.

129
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:43,799
Stop. Why did I even say that? And by the way, for those of you that's

130
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:49,080
saying, why is he like use this little like fucking black and decker nail gun?

131
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,870
No, I can't pick up, uh, I can't pick up weapons.

132
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:57,029
I'm unauthorized. I, everyone was very, very upset about that last time.

133
00:11:57,029 --> 00:12:05,220
All right. I need to get out to the main area, which is

134
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:17,879
I go in the right way. Is this the right way? Yeah, this is right, right?

135
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:28,759
Mr. Rat. Get the rat. You missed the rat. Was there a rat on the ground?

136
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:43,720
Where's the rat? Rat list? Where is it? Are you? Dude, was it on the ground?

137
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:49,289
Oh, okay. There it is. List of rats. All right. I got it. I thought you're talking

138
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:51,769
about like, like there was a rat on the ground.

139
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:58,250
It's like you missed the rats. You missed the rats. Like, I thought like, oh, there's

140
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:05,100
like a rat on the ground. All right. Let's go. I just have to make

141
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:10,600
my way back to the elevator, which who knows how where that is.

142
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:17,320
It's been more than 24 hours. It's, it's gone from my mind.

143
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:23,500
Just jump. Oh, yeah. There's no fall damage. You're right. Can I use this?

144
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,559
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Do I want to go in here though?

145
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:36,200
Where is it going to take me? Well, this is going to take me back up or down.

146
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:48,470
It's going to take you back up. That's, is that what that's what I want, right?

147
00:13:48,470 --> 00:14:01,700
Try it out. Yeah. Don't press the red button.

148
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:10,759
Of course they would make a game where you have to backtrack again and then the

149
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:13,639
whole. Oh, no, no, no. This is it. This is it. This is it.

150
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:21,779
No, it's not. This is not it. This is not it.

151
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:28,279
Uh, I just went down. Somebody said I was going to go

152
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:33,289
up and then I went down. All right. Hey, welcome to the stream. Let's go.

153
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:58,809
Here we go again. Let's go up. This is brain.

154
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:02,860
Okay. So what what's the actual way to go?

155
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,440
Oh, God damn it. Are you telling me that I just could have walked through this?

156
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:15,899
So I went this way. No, I didn't. Wait.

157
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:21,179
Upper mines. Yeah, this is where I want. This is where I want to be. I hate

158
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:24,620
backtracking. I'm so glad it was deleted from every video game.

159
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:34,700
All right. So right or left though. What's like the actual how do I get like

160
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:56,470
back to where I want to go? He's on DMT. No, this way.

161
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:05,220
Imagine trying to stream on DMT. That would be impossible. If somebody

162
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:13,100
could do that in no fucking way. Not a chance in hell.

163
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:20,330
Where the hell do I even want to go though? Like I'm trying to just get back

164
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:39,139
to the beginning. This is a safe point. Okay. I gotta sneak

165
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:49,750
through here. He's done it. Did I though? Like I have no idea

166
00:16:49,750 --> 00:17:02,009
where the fuck I am. Climb those boxes. This is just bringing

167
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:16,970
me back this way. Through here? Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is to

168
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:27,289
security checkpoint. Right. This is this. I'm going the right way.

169
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:40,230
Game is now very, very quiet. I got you. Why is this so new? This is new. I haven't

170
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:48,730
seen this. Oh my god. This is the this is the beginning.

171
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:58,039
This is the beginning. Okay. I found it. Just check your map. Well, the problem

172
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:00,599
with the map is it literally just looks. I don't even

173
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:03,240
know where I am. I don't know which one of these rooms I'm in.

174
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:12,410
I made it. This is the beginning. I just don't die.

175
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,700
There's no fucking way I'm going to be able to get through this.

176
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,819
Not a chance. I'm not going to be able to. Can I electrocute him? Could I like

177
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:26,980
lure him out here and push him into the electricity? You shouldn't have eaten a

178
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:27,619
BLT.

179
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:41,750
Where's the light? Turn it off. You've had too much mayonnaise on that BLT, dude.

180
00:18:44,900 --> 00:19:10,869
All right. Now you're in my world. Does he have to be?

181
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:14,150
Well, I'm never going to be able to get by this guy.

182
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:31,940
He's just standing in the doorway. I don't think I'm going to be able to do this.

183
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:39,589
I might as well just run. I think I'm going to have to just run.

184
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:52,069
Use the bat? This doesn't work. I already did this.

185
00:19:52,630 --> 00:20:04,569
All right. Ready? One, two, three, go. I can't see anything.

186
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:29,940
Now that's what we call a. Okay. This is what I need to do, right?

187
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:38,140
What? I just got a new code. Oh, fuck this. I'm out. I'm done.

188
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,849
We actually just take this back. All right. Here we go.

189
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:56,279
Get the rifle. You can't pick up rifles. You can't pick up rifles. You can't.

190
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,720
Oh, yeah. I tried to tape this. It doesn't matter.

191
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:07,529
I ripped the tape off in rage. It didn't work. All right. Perfect.

192
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:14,490
Now it's going to go back to tower 19. Why is all this activated?

193
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:27,259
Can this open? This is all messed up. The vent to get in.

194
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:40,140
I just broke my chair. I'm sorry to hear that. What's the point of this vent?

195
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:57,880
Wait, why can I even open this? Oh, it's the cigarettes.

196
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:07,829
All right. Well, hold on a jump up here and climb. Get those ciggy butts.

197
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:22,279
What the hell am I doing? I feel like I'm cheating right now.

198
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:25,319
All right. Where am I? Cargo transport.

199
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:29,799
I need to go back to like tower 17 and like the feed ward. Where the fuck am I?

200
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:35,460
Security checkpoint. I climb and I hang.

201
00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:46,069
I guess this is not going to. Why am I doing this?

202
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:58,779
What am I doing this for? I can't sneak attack him.

203
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:08,890
Can I break? Should I break? That door is not going to open.

204
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:12,539
That door doesn't open. I think I have to break the glass and go in.

205
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,869
Stealth kill. I don't think you can.

206
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:39,210
I'm right up his ass. If he moves, he's going to know I'm here.

207
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:47,700
Is this motherfucker even active?

208
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,299
Holy shit. I thought he was inactive. I thought he didn't do anything.

209
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:57,099
I thought he was inactive. I was bumping into him and stuff.

210
00:23:57,099 --> 00:24:04,519
I thought he was not activated. I thought he was not moving around and shit.

211
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:09,829
OK, so what the fuck? So that's not the way to go.

212
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:15,930
So I need to go back down here.

213
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:28,200
I have to go and like climb into the vents and shit, don't I?

214
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:37,940
This is the wrong way. Am I getting a cut scene?

215
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:50,279
Wait, hold on. Hold on.

216
00:24:50,920 --> 00:25:08,809
Do I just need to give me the lights? Turn the lights on.

217
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:28,660
And then we go backwards, right? Yeah.

218
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:41,240
No, we don't go backwards here. Stop using the club.

219
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:47,339
Well, that's not my main concern. My main concern is what's the one stupid way

220
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:52,299
to go back and go back, backtracking, backtracking, backtrack.

221
00:25:52,940 --> 00:26:13,799
I have to go beyond the bridge? Stop the car.

222
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:15,880
I'm just going to watch a fucking YouTube video on how to get back here.

223
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:44,329
Hold on. That's cheating. That's fine.

224
00:26:44,329 --> 00:26:46,890
He's doing the... He needs a video guide.

225
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:51,140
Why would you have it like climb through? I don't... I don't...

226
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,220
I'm not even going to... Look, I'm not even going to...

227
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,299
What do you want me to say? I'm not even going to say what you think I'm going to say.

228
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:01,000
All right, I've made it to another fucking gray room.

229
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:19,660
All right, now it's up... Do I go up here and then all the way around?

230
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:36,680
This is the mines again. You need to go back to the elevator.

231
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:40,089
What? The elevator just took me to a place I couldn't go.

232
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:45,380
Is this shit it? Did I make it?

233
00:27:54,069 --> 00:27:57,829
Dude, you took the whole bottle. This is it, right?

234
00:27:57,829 --> 00:27:59,910
No, because this just brings me... Wait, what?

235
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:04,779
This is the fan, which then brings you back to the original area, which then...

236
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:20,259
This is a mess. Don't turn the service panel back on, dude.

237
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:33,980
Okay, so this is the beginning. I should be able just to go in that elevator and take me down.

238
00:28:42,069 --> 00:28:45,190
I remember this shit. Do you remember this? This is the very beginning.

239
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:50,329
This is how I got down here in the first place.

240
00:28:51,849 --> 00:28:55,369
Remember? I was like, oh, I can't do this yet. Why is this elevator not the way out?

241
00:28:55,369 --> 00:29:07,619
This is how we came in. Take this elevator.

242
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:10,099
Didn't I try that already? They took me to a weird fucked up place.

243
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:24,630
No, go up the ladder in this elevator. Wait, this is a different...

244
00:29:25,829 --> 00:29:28,150
Wait, this is the same thing. You're fucking with me.

245
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:36,569
We're in the same spot. Use the elevator?

246
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:41,210
Didn't I do that already? It took me up to that weird spot where the guy was blocking the door.

247
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:43,450
Use the elevator first and then go up the vent.

248
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,869
Why? Why can't I just leave? Why can't I just leave?

249
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:05,750
He's never going to find the cheese. Why can't I just leave?

250
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:10,410
Oh, okay. So take elevator up. Don't go out elevator door.

251
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,410
Go up elevator fucking ladder into the dark vents.

252
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,809
Go through vents up. There's two different vents, by the way.

253
00:30:14,809 --> 00:30:19,160
There's two elevators with two different vents. They both look the same.

254
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:29,500
What the fuck is this? What is this like being John Malkovich hole that I have to find?

255
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:33,029
Which, by the way, that's a pretty good movie if you haven't seen it.

256
00:30:33,589 --> 00:30:43,269
All right. We found it. We did it.

257
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:46,710
All right. Good. Now I can finally just turn off the...

258
00:30:47,349 --> 00:30:55,380
Wait, no, I didn't. Did I find it?

259
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:03,049
Oh, healing station. Oh, that's it. I don't want to do the vent thing again.

260
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:09,269
Oh, my God. I don't want to do the vent thing again.

261
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:13,220
Hey, by the way, guys, we hadn't even hit yet.

262
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:15,619
I just wanted to make that's going to be very clear.

263
00:31:16,259 --> 00:31:25,740
Are we up or are we down? Where are we?

264
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:34,069
It's going to... Oh, it's going to get worse from here.

265
00:31:34,069 --> 00:31:36,630
No, it's not because we're not going to have to do any more like vent climbing.

266
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:42,019
You'll know when you'll know because I'm just going to go...

267
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:52,200
Hey, I have to go that way. I have to go over here.

268
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,769
Right now, you hear me? This is... I'm completely with it.

269
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:01,589
Oh, maybe not completely, but as with it as I am without being on any type of substances.

270
00:32:04,569 --> 00:32:07,369
He ate the whole... He took the whole... He ate the whole brownie.

271
00:32:09,819 --> 00:32:14,680
It's going to be... That was what we call a little...

272
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:21,559
Oh, I thought I could... Never mind. All right. Give me the health.

273
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:23,000
He ate the whole plate.

274
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:37,289
How do you eat a whole plate of brownies in a regular circumstance?

275
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,089
That's what I want to know.

276
00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:42,250
Oh, wow. He ate the whole plate.

277
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,410
Why would you eat a whole plate of brownies normally?

278
00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:48,650
If this happens again, I'm going to eat the batteries that are in it.

279
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,980
Hope that doesn't happen again.

280
00:32:51,980 --> 00:33:02,940
I feel like if I ate more than two brownies, it would be like cement in my stomach.

281
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:10,460
Did I fuck something up?

282
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,740
Why could I not do this? What's going on?

283
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,230
Oh, thank God. It's another vent.

284
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,509
Wait, there's two vents now.

285
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,359
There are three vents.

286
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:22,460
What's the right vent?

287
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,660
Oh, I can't even go in that one.

288
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:32,740
Am I doing this right?

289
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:43,910
I really hope I never have to do this again because this sucks.

290
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,509
I don't want to be in vents.

291
00:33:46,150 --> 00:34:00,890
I don't want to just do vents while I be in a dark room

292
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:07,900
and then immediately go to a light room the whole day.

293
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,260
Like, I don't think I've even been here.

294
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:24,090
Oh, cigarettes. What is this?

295
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:24,730
Can I climb that?

296
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,019
My character's just like on DMT.

297
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,699
Oh, shit. The lights are so bright.

298
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:54,579
Turn the lights up.

299
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:57,449
Where am I?

300
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,530
No, don't make any jokes. I don't want to lose.

301
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:17,079
I'm sorry, dude. I'm on fucking DMT.

302
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:19,340
I don't even know who you are.

303
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:30,489
Is this thing alive?

304
00:35:30,489 --> 00:35:43,900
That thing's going to come out and attack me, isn't it?

305
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,780
Am I going crazy?

306
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,780
Was I just supposed to go back to tower 19?

307
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,420
What is all this shit?

308
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:52,900
Was I not supposed to kill him?

309
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:56,039
Wait, do I need a screwdriver?

310
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,239
Was it an NPC? Did I ruin everything?

311
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:09,400
What's over here?

312
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,280
Oh, I can go down there.

313
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:18,579
This is where I was before.

314
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:19,380
Did I miss something?

315
00:36:20,019 --> 00:36:23,960
I didn't soft lock the game, right?

316
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:33,980
No. No, I didn't.

317
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:39,369
Hold on. Wait, did I DMT lock the game?

318
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:44,860
I hope that's not the running thing

319
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,860
we continue to reference this stream.

320
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,820
I'm sure it will be, but I don't want it to be that.

321
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,300
What's this?

322
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:01,480
No, there's nothing down here.

323
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:03,800
I have to do something with that robot in there.

324
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:23,699
No doors or anything.

325
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:33,130
Guys, I think I may have soft locked myself.

326
00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:45,139
No, there's a ladder.

327
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,800
Is it alive?

328
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,119
What? Hold on, what?

329
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:55,159
I get to be in the suit?

330
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:03,099
Oh, shit!

331
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:09,699
I don't know where I am.

332
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,550
How many balls do I have?

333
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:18,280
Wait, why can I walk through walls?

334
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,829
I had the thing on.

335
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:30,550
I had the thing on.

336
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,909
But this doesn't help me.

337
00:38:33,909 --> 00:38:35,190
This just makes me more dangerous.

338
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,230
I still don't know where to go.

339
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:47,130
Oh, I'm opening the doors with my little T-Rex hand.

340
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,280
I'm going to the briefing room.

341
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,639
All right, nice work.

342
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:15,780
Oh, okay.

343
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,579
Okay, I don't.

344
00:39:17,539 --> 00:39:22,150
Is he dead?

345
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,349
Wait, can I get in his suit?

346
00:39:23,989 --> 00:39:25,909
I want to get in his suit.

347
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:32,710
Wait, why are there two?

348
00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:34,619
There were two?

349
00:39:35,179 --> 00:39:36,219
How are there two of them?

350
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:39,480
Oh no, look at him.

351
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,320
He's sad.

352
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,199
Look at what he did.

353
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:50,389
He made me kill.

354
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:58,599
Two of my reverent monstrosities.

355
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:00,599
I never want to be in this place again.

356
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:08,820
Jerry, take me from here once and for all.

357
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,699
Okay, man.

358
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:10,820
Let's get out of here.

359
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:19,320
And Jerry, if you would please give me some of that DMT.

360
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:22,340
Oh, you want some DMT, dude?

361
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,059
All right, you got it.

362
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:25,579
I'll take some right now.

363
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,559
Right now?

364
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:28,519
Right now?

365
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:28,760
Yes.

366
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:32,489
Hold on, man.

367
00:40:32,489 --> 00:40:40,280
I'm not sure you're ready for this.

368
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,079
I am ready.

369
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:43,480
I'm starting to consider this whole witty thing a major-

370
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:43,960
All right, man.

371
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,519
Here you go.

372
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:45,800
I'm going to give it to you right now.

373
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,400
Just lift your tongue up.

374
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,059
Holy shit.

375
00:40:56,739 --> 00:40:57,380
Holy shit.

376
00:40:58,179 --> 00:41:00,309
I can see the machine alien.

377
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:06,360
Perons have been here for 10,000 years.

378
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,719
Not 10 billion.

379
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:25,079
I think the clerk at my local Walmart is actually Jesus reborn.

380
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:28,119
And here are 200 reasons why.

381
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:31,980
Hey, whoa, man.

382
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:32,380
Whoa, man.

383
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,219
You got to settle down on a DMT.

384
00:41:37,449 --> 00:41:41,320
Oh, that was wonderful.

385
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:44,250
Thank you for that experience.

386
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:46,250
Yeah, man.

387
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,010
I really wanted to DMT you.

388
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:49,690
Just hit me up any time of the week.

389
00:41:57,019 --> 00:41:57,739
Get out of here.

390
00:42:08,949 --> 00:42:09,510
Get out.

391
00:42:10,309 --> 00:42:12,710
I need to get out of the robot to see.

392
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:17,980
Anybody know where I'm going?

393
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,260
Read the screen.

394
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,260
It's just Matrix glitter.

395
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,300
I can't read that.

396
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:40,010
Did I just go back the other way?

397
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:57,289
Oh, no.

398
00:42:57,289 --> 00:42:57,849
Shit.

399
00:42:57,849 --> 00:42:59,690
Somebody just said this guy is dumb.

400
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:00,969
No, dude, I'm not.

401
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:02,010
I'll get it.

402
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:03,530
Don't leave.

403
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:04,329
Just hold on.

404
00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:23,780
All right.

405
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,460
I got rid of the noise.

406
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:31,030
Wait, that was a big problem for me,

407
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:32,710
but that wasn't the actual problem.

408
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:44,980
I can't go through any of these.

409
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:51,369
Maybe I'm really just not supposed to go this way

410
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:55,000
unless there's an event.

411
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,110
Wait, I have to...

412
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,429
No, I have to leave DMT robot.

413
00:43:59,429 --> 00:43:59,909
No, I don't.

414
00:43:59,909 --> 00:44:00,789
He can get up here.

415
00:44:00,789 --> 00:44:18,150
Oh, no.

416
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:21,619
That's too bad.

417
00:44:27,159 --> 00:44:28,360
Oh, that's it.

418
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:36,380
Well, see you later, DMT robot.

419
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:41,670
It's been a lot of fun.

420
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:42,550
Thank you, Jerry.

421
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:45,699
You have given me more experiences

422
00:44:45,699 --> 00:44:47,699
than I could possibly ask for in a human.

423
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:53,059
Have a wonderful rest of your game.

424
00:44:55,079 --> 00:45:00,260
Powering Joe.

425
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:00,760
Bye.

426
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,019
Bye.

427
00:45:02,019 --> 00:45:02,900
It's nice to meet you.

428
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,539
Bye.

429
00:45:03,539 --> 00:45:11,420
Turn off the filter.

430
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:15,670
Where'd he go?

431
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:40,940
The real DMT was the friends we made along the way.

432
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:44,630
This elevator sucks.

433
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:45,510
Why is it not moving?

434
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:54,119
It's because it's not an elevator.

435
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:55,769
Shit.

436
00:45:55,769 --> 00:45:56,489
Oh, wait a minute.

437
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:05,340
All right.

438
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:06,699
DMT robot, power on.

439
00:46:09,659 --> 00:46:12,139
We're going to have a bunch more fun, man.

440
00:46:12,139 --> 00:46:13,260
We're going to take DMT

441
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:14,539
and we're going to do all this fun shit.

442
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,380
I cannot wait.

443
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,500
Please climb inside of me.

444
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,099
No.

445
00:46:19,099 --> 00:46:32,940
Oh, no.

446
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:37,769
That's the origin story for DMT robot becoming a villain.

447
00:46:37,769 --> 00:46:38,969
Why am I climbing this?

448
00:46:39,769 --> 00:46:42,579
Why would he do that?

449
00:46:42,579 --> 00:46:43,300
I didn't do that.

450
00:46:50,699 --> 00:46:51,900
I didn't climb that.

451
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,340
I wanted just to walk down here.

452
00:47:03,289 --> 00:47:03,610
Okay.

453
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,400
I'm...

454
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,719
It's hard to aim at the guy.

455
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,800
It's very, very difficult.

456
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,239
It's a difficult experience.

457
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:14,440
That's a difficult game.

458
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,000
It's hard.

459
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,280
It's a difficult game.

460
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:30,059
Why is he shooting at me?

461
00:47:30,699 --> 00:47:31,099
No.

462
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:31,980
DMT robot.

463
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:32,539
What are you doing?

464
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:36,380
Oh, that was another robot.

465
00:47:44,869 --> 00:47:45,909
What the fuck happened here?

466
00:47:54,389 --> 00:47:55,190
Okay.

467
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:55,590
All right.

468
00:47:56,469 --> 00:47:57,590
How do I get you to move?

469
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:59,429
Oh, no.

470
00:48:00,389 --> 00:48:06,090
Oh, no.

471
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:08,650
It's CVT robot.

472
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:11,849
No, that can't be who that canonically is in this universe.

473
00:48:11,849 --> 00:48:12,329
I'm sorry.

474
00:48:15,829 --> 00:48:16,469
Just get in.

475
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:19,260
Let's go.

476
00:48:28,019 --> 00:48:31,300
I only died before I could do the joke part of what I was going to do.

477
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:37,380
It is too bad that one of my friends had to perish.

478
00:48:39,769 --> 00:48:40,570
What happened?

479
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:41,690
What happened to the audio?

480
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:49,800
Did I fuck it up?

481
00:48:56,059 --> 00:48:56,460
All right.

482
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:58,539
Well, that's where that arc ends.

483
00:48:58,539 --> 00:48:59,900
I was going to do a thing where

484
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:03,420
this was going to be his dad mad that he was taking DMT.

485
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,500
He was going to be like, I'm adventuring, dad.

486
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:06,059
Leave me alone.

487
00:49:06,059 --> 00:49:07,099
And they're going to be the big fight.

488
00:49:07,099 --> 00:49:09,579
And it's like his dad dies because they're fighting.

489
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:10,940
You know, that's going to do that whole thing.

490
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:14,019
Let's just pretend I did that.

491
00:49:14,019 --> 00:49:14,260
All right.

492
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:14,739
That was fun.

493
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:33,989
I did not expect that I was actually going to get into one of these though.

494
00:49:33,989 --> 00:49:37,260
The whole game, they tease you about how scary they are.

495
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:51,929
It's going to be really sad when he actually dies.

496
00:49:51,929 --> 00:49:55,659
I'm out of his aggro range.

497
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:55,980
It's fine.

498
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:04,539
Grenade.

499
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:10,170
Oh, no.

500
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:10,969
He's going to die.

501
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,699
Is there a healing thing I can do?

502
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:20,500
These people are friendly.

503
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,440
These people are not friendly.

504
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:24,679
Okay.

505
00:50:26,389 --> 00:50:26,710
Okay.

506
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:27,269
That's it.

507
00:50:27,269 --> 00:50:28,789
Someone's sitting in the flamingos.

508
00:50:35,139 --> 00:50:36,019
I took a lot of hits.

509
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:38,659
Flamingos?

510
00:50:38,659 --> 00:50:38,820
Yeah.

511
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:39,539
What does that mean?

512
00:50:40,179 --> 00:50:49,269
I'm almost dead.

513
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,960
I feel like this is what the dinosaur fossils of an AT-ST would look like.

514
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:00,599
He's dead.

515
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,099
Does it mean I'm dead?

516
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:22,179
I got to be careful here.

517
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:23,699
Out of like health.

518
00:51:23,699 --> 00:51:29,460
Prepare the robot.

519
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:29,780
I don't know.

520
00:51:30,579 --> 00:51:31,380
I don't know how to do that.

521
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,440
No, you can't.

522
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,760
I have the screwdriver on.

523
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:45,239
It doesn't work.

524
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:51,590
I just have to not take any hits.

525
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:58,389
It's kind of hard to do that, though.

526
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:04,739
It's regenerating health.

527
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,949
Is it?

528
00:52:08,059 --> 00:52:08,460
Okay.

529
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,139
They expect me to walk through immediately.

530
00:52:10,139 --> 00:52:10,539
I didn't.

531
00:52:10,539 --> 00:52:11,260
They blew everything up.

532
00:52:19,659 --> 00:52:20,380
Stand still.

533
00:52:21,019 --> 00:52:23,590
All right.

534
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:25,269
I'm going to stand still after this and see if I heal.

535
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:34,710
Okay.

536
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:35,030
Here we go.

537
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:35,269
Ready?

538
00:52:35,269 --> 00:52:37,909
Let's, for God's sake, hope they can do their job.

539
00:52:38,469 --> 00:52:41,239
Shut it off.

540
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:42,119
Yep.

541
00:52:46,389 --> 00:52:47,429
I don't think that it works.

542
00:52:49,289 --> 00:52:50,570
I think we have to ditch.

543
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:52,809
Somebody said R2DMT2.

544
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:54,250
I think that's two.

545
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:55,130
I don't know about that.

546
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,730
I'm not sure I'm going to sign off on that one.

547
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:59,079
No, there's no deal.

548
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:07,670
I just have to not die to the flamingos.

549
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:10,889
That was my joke.

550
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:16,579
Yeah, so I said somebody said that.

551
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:18,840
Okay.

552
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:19,719
This is important.

553
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:29,769
Shit.

554
00:53:33,659 --> 00:53:34,860
God, he's dying.

555
00:53:35,739 --> 00:53:36,300
I'm sorry.

556
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:36,860
I got to get out.

557
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:37,820
Get out.

558
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:38,139
Get out.

559
00:53:38,139 --> 00:53:38,539
Get out.

560
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:54,409
Duck.

561
00:53:54,409 --> 00:53:54,650
No.

562
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:55,289
Wait.

563
00:53:55,289 --> 00:53:55,929
I'm just looking at...

564
00:53:55,929 --> 00:53:56,570
They're killing him.

565
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:10,199
I'm stuck in here.

566
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:13,429
I'm actually stuck in here.

567
00:54:13,429 --> 00:54:13,909
I can't move.

568
00:54:14,789 --> 00:54:15,510
How did I get in here?

569
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,079
Wait.

570
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:26,250
I can smoke.

571
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:29,530
Can I keep going up?

572
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:36,980
How the hell am I going to do this without the robot?

573
00:54:37,699 --> 00:54:39,300
Wait.

574
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,019
What about up there?

575
00:54:40,659 --> 00:54:44,699
Ow.

576
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:48,630
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

577
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:49,130
Ah.

578
00:54:49,909 --> 00:54:51,800
I would have...

579
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,079
I could have shot the lights.

580
00:54:53,079 --> 00:54:53,880
Fuck, you're right.

581
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,159
Oh, I'm so stupid.

582
00:54:55,719 --> 00:55:04,179
I'm not fucking around anymore.

583
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:04,579
Let's go.

584
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,139
Yeah, that's right.

585
00:55:14,139 --> 00:55:14,619
I took the...

586
00:55:14,619 --> 00:55:15,900
I got the last punch.

587
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:21,639
Did not mean to exit.

588
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,460
Send in the flamingos.

589
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:48,039
Did, did, did, did, did, did, did.

590
00:55:48,039 --> 00:55:51,670
This dude says, ow, and he gets hit in the video game.

591
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:52,150
LOL.

592
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:52,309
Yeah.

593
00:55:52,309 --> 00:55:52,789
Okay.

594
00:55:52,789 --> 00:55:56,150
Um, I have the Nintendo Power magazine order for him.

595
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:58,230
I ordered the fucking vest thing

596
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:00,230
that vibrates when you take damage in a game.

597
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:05,349
You don't play games with those?

598
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:10,090
Okay, fine, dude.

599
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:11,130
So you're not like a real...

600
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:13,050

00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:15,050
and then you don't like put your body, like into...

602
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:15,369
Okay.

603
00:56:16,489 --> 00:56:17,690
Now, that's like cool though.

604
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:19,210

605
00:56:26,059 --> 00:56:26,699

833
02:06:49,340 --> 02:07:05,130
with trump that's naughty that's what you made that up like you made that up i can't think of

835
02:07:13,779 --> 02:07:28,819

836
02:07:28,819 --> 02:07:41,899
that i already turned it on like i would believe aliens landed on earth and like we're all going

837
02:07:41,899 --> 02:07:48,460
to be like they're gonna just like enslave like all everybody like we're like aliens come and

838
02:07:48,460 --> 02:07:55,590
we're now they like just take over i would believe that more than news than vin diesel

839
02:07:55,590 --> 02:08:21,369
and donald trump played dnd together it's real this is not that this is toy fair performances

840
02:08:22,170 --> 02:08:28,890
he sends the competition to a watery grave this is not donald trump playing dnd it's the hammerhead

1098
03:34:30,549 --> 03:34:47,299
why is the cryo jail easier than the mines yeah i don't know why was the mines the most horrible

1099
03:34:47,299 --> 03:35:02,389
thing ever everything else was so much fun and then it was just it just ruined everything

1100
03:35:02,389 --> 03:35:29,100
where is he you can't shoot through that glass done holy shit dude your aim i'm fine it's tricky

1107
03:37:14,170 --> 03:37:29,620

1108
03:37:31,620 --> 03:37:37,940
i fought gigantic robots that took way less effort than shooting a regular guy with a pistol

1109
03:37:45,659 --> 03:37:51,180

1115
03:39:04,340 --> 03:39:07,700

1116
03:39:07,700 --> 03:39:23,239

1139
03:47:13,340 --> 03:47:27,799

1147
03:49:29,299 --> 03:49:40,040
the area it's annoying i just it's it just distracts me i won't you think i have attention problems

1148
03:49:40,040 --> 03:49:57,420
in games now imagine with tts i would do tts maybe once or twice if it made sense and it was

1149
03:49:57,420 --> 03:50:23,100
something that was a major part of the stream okay so if you're a part of the group that he was

1150
03:50:23,100 --> 03:50:29,860
just with do you continue to walk this way or do you go holy shit and well it looks like

1151
03:50:30,899 --> 03:51:01,799
sure oh you wouldn't where do i go do one tts stream but do a children's puzzle i mean that

1152
03:51:01,799 --> 03:51:28,229
might be funny that might be fun can you press buttons do you say exit immediately why is he

1153
03:51:28,229 --> 03:51:56,620
kicking me out he's literally kicking me out that's not cool i can't take him with me okay

1154
03:51:57,739 --> 03:52:17,420
well am i gonna die in a cutscene somebody said incoming capture incoming metal thing around neck

1155

1157
03:52:52,809 --> 03:53:04,569
guy i even stepped the bastard on the med fees i thought this was a bad guy wait i did he think

1158
03:53:04,569 --> 03:53:10,969
he was going to take me to another prison he was haphazardly pointing the gun behind him

1159
03:53:11,690 --> 03:53:15,459
like he was looking in the backseat to like talk to kids in the backseat

1160
03:53:16,100 --> 03:53:32,790
he that wasn't was he good was it a turn i don't get it why wouldn't you just leave retic

1161
03:53:34,569 --> 03:53:44,219
why he come back here i guess you want to just shoot a missile into the window and leave

1162
03:53:45,180 --> 03:53:53,559
you'll probably you'll get him just hold a middle finger like right out the front window and shoot

1163
03:53:53,719 --> 03:53:54,360
make sure he sees

1164
03:54:16,709 --> 03:54:23,420
what the fuck is that device that chair doesn't make any sense that doesn't make that chair

1165
03:54:23,420 --> 03:54:26,940
i'm that's that's the most bizarre piece of architecture i've ever seen in a house

1166
03:54:28,729 --> 03:54:43,079
what is it what's the point of that why would you not go okay well here's the shotgun

1167
03:54:45,020 --> 03:54:48,139
i got a shotgun and i'm fighting his most intense unit

1168
03:54:58,409 --> 03:55:04,790
maximum security gamer room is what somebody just said and i cannot think of a more stupid

1169
03:55:04,790 --> 03:55:13,350
way to describe what we just watched maximum security gamer room i've got my two my two

1170
03:55:13,350 --> 03:55:30,409
gamer defense robots wasn't he just right here he can teleport thanks for for the last encounter

1171
03:55:30,409 --> 03:55:47,559
of the game showing me that things can disappear and teleport all right retic how do we get rid

1172
03:55:47,559 --> 03:57:12,979
of the sun my they can just see me now so you know hold the button down it overheats what

1173
03:57:12,979 --> 03:57:31,139
where's my what is it almost at the end of chapter one fog i find a pillar they teleport

1174
03:57:31,139 --> 03:58:37,750
should i just use the shotgun instead yeah okay that's just that's really cool where the hell is

1175
03:58:47,020 --> 03:59:11,180
uh god fucking damn it that one of them sucks one of them really really sucks so i can just

1176
03:59:11,180 --> 03:59:24,500
give it a one that really really really sucks first this one this guy's an idiot but it's so

1177
03:59:24,500 --> 03:59:44,469
easy that was so easy it should have been that easy i was holding i was holding the minigun down

1178
03:59:44,469 --> 03:59:54,459
what must be something wait there's no way to leave so he was just in there enclosed in this

1179
03:59:54,459 --> 04:00:02,809
little sphere oh shit hopefully they get him you wouldn't have a little back door

1180
04:00:06,020 --> 04:00:32,299
can you walk john i think so maybe how's your eyesight but now we're under arrest we're no we're

1181
04:00:32,299 --> 04:01:00,420
gonna know we're pretending to be arrested okay when they realize this who do you think blames

1182
04:01:00,420 --> 04:01:10,860
who for that one what do these guys just get on the next plane and leave just thinking that was

1183
04:01:17,370 --> 04:01:25,180
the guys clearly you have flashlights he's clearly tied to a chair with like a gag in his mouth

1184
04:01:33,799 --> 04:01:45,000
he wasn't bald well that's the end i won i only got medium

1185
04:01:56,489 --> 04:02:03,799
that's funny now do the sequel i'm not doing the whole sequel we'll check it out how about that

1186
04:02:03,799 --> 04:02:10,120
i'll check out the sequel i'm not i'm not doing it all i will i'll go into dark athena and i'll

1187
04:02:10,120 --> 04:02:43,219
look around i can't skip and i oh we just jumped right in what's how do i rate uh escape from well

1188
04:02:43,219 --> 04:02:56,979
here's the thing so dark athena is just essentially like a long dlc campaign just a remade which is

1189
04:03:02,020 --> 04:03:14,840
no one said that i said that because i did my research so it turns out we didn't make it out

1190
04:03:20,340 --> 04:03:37,110
no more of this i just want to look around all right if i can swim we'll play if i cannot swim

1191
04:03:37,110 --> 04:03:47,559
we won't play okay i have a feeling they added swimming to this one all right i'll see you later

1192
04:04:05,020 --> 04:04:08,540
red light on the door yeah i already know this i've this i played this

1193
04:04:09,500 --> 04:04:16,600
first x to go into stealth and crouch i just want to i want to kill one person

1194
04:04:17,319 --> 04:04:28,629
it's called eye shine i need to watch these movies i feel like i've been so lost

1195
04:04:39,500 --> 04:04:50,100
gemma gemma wait did he say kill me please or don't kill me please

1196
04:04:50,819 --> 04:05:06,389
i feel like that's really important what what first word is there he said play fall guys no

1197
04:05:06,950 --> 04:05:16,469
no he did not and even if he did i'm not sure i would do it oh oh i just want to look at the

1198
04:05:16,549 --> 04:05:17,190
extra content

1199
04:05:48,389 --> 04:06:01,989
wait when your palms what was that a new move in um i think i missed it it was just counter oh

1200
04:06:01,989 --> 04:06:13,639
okay making sure well this was fun i had fun playing uh britic i knew the game was worth

1201
04:06:13,639 --> 04:06:17,799
playing and it was worth playing i think it was fun i think i had a really good time playing it

1202
04:06:18,520 --> 04:06:32,680
you know what's funny though i there's not been one opportunity where i really

1203
04:06:33,399 --> 04:06:39,690
really needed to use the stealth like not the stealth the uh the drag the drag body thing

1204
04:06:40,409 --> 04:07:06,020
i'm supposed to go over here uh what let's play sonic adventure 2 on the dreamcast i didn't know

1205
04:07:06,020 --> 04:07:29,659
i already played sonic hold this great off okay while in stealth mode blue wait i had to wait

1206
04:07:30,459 --> 04:07:46,149
i had to wait this whole time oh this is wait whose gun is this am i holding this dude

1207
04:07:46,870 --> 04:08:15,559
i've got this dude hostage all right you're coming with me let's go hostage wow why was

1208
04:08:15,559 --> 04:08:49,979
this not in the first game this dude's dead what the guy is the gun that's that's actually pretty

1209
04:08:49,979 --> 04:09:06,090
cool i can't walk forward with him though that's kind of annoying uh it's a health kit i don't have

1210
04:09:06,090 --> 04:09:22,920
any you know that's a different mechanism i feel like that's probably more comfortable than the

1211
04:09:22,920 --> 04:09:46,540
last one stuff them in your inventory play fall guys i think that's a code they stay right there

1212
04:09:46,540 --> 04:10:07,299
hold on just stay right there for a minute hey you guys really want to see fall guys really

1213
