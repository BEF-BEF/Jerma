1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:07,719
Why hello. Good afternoon, good evening, everybody. Good morning for some of you, probably.

2
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:29,420
I am Jeremy. Jeremy D. Elbertson. The D is for Daniel. We are going to play Kenshi again,

3
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:40,039
but a few things have come up that need to be addressed, that are very important, and just

4
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:47,130
came up with the idea two or three hours ago. So it's going to take a little bit of planning,

5
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:53,049
it's going to take some time on my part and on yours. You guys aren't doing nobody's in trouble.

6
00:00:53,049 --> 00:01:04,439
What? Why does everybody think they're in trouble? No, it's about New Year's Eve. So before, well,

7
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,879
well, you know, hold on, just give me a second. Let me just open my soda off camera, because I

8
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:17,159
don't want to blow out everybody's ears. So let's just open that up right. All right, got it open.

9
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:24,180
Put it in your sippy cup. No, this is, I can drink out of a soda. A soda is a giant sippy cup.

10
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,239
Well, I mean, it's a regular size sippy cup, but it's just a, it's a sippy cup already.

11
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:36,950
It has one small hole to enter and exit. It's not a giant empty void at the top of a cup.

12
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:46,870
Anywho, I'm going to wait till people get here, because this is the last second thing that I want

13
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:52,379
to do for New Year's Eve. Long story short, before we really get into the meat there,

14
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:57,799
I have the studio for New Year's Eve. I'm going to do a New Year's Eve award show,

15
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:06,420
based on the worst moments of the last 12 months. So you guys are going to be nominating,

16
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,550
and I'm talking very quickly. Not yet, though. Not yet. We'll go over it. I'm going over this

17
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,629
in real time, because this shit just came up, like, like I said, a couple hours ago.

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,080
So there will be categories to nominate some of the worst moments of the year. We're talking

19
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:34,219
worst joke, worst overall stream, worst hair on stream, worst noise, best use of cardboard.

20
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:44,979
You know, there's got to be a couple best of categories. Worst gaming stream, like we're

21
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:50,439
talking, I want to get all of them. There'll be probably 10 or so, maybe 15 categories.

22
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,819
And we're going to do an award ceremony on New Year's Eve to count down the New Year.

23
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:10,870
Why not make all best? Because that's, we already talked about this last night.

24
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:16,039
Have best streamer, and I'm not even on the list now. But how this is going to work

25
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:27,879
is that the channel is currently locked. I'm eight hours behind you for midnight. It's 8am.

26
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:33,080
Well, it's not that I could do about that. I'm not I'm not Atlas. I can't like spin. And I'm

27
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,680
not talking about the video game. I'm talking about like the guy that holds the earth.

28
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:45,189
So let's just wait for people to get here. I got the game set up already. We're going to play

29
00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:51,830
Kenshi again. We got the frog friends. But we're really only going to have you're going to have

30
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:55,830
one day to nominate stuff, because we're going to I'm going to give you all the categories here.

31
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:01,349
We're going to write them out on stream a little bit later. Then you're going to have a day or so

32
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:06,629
to nominate in a discord channel that's separate. Same thing that's going to happen like happen with

33
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:14,099
the Christmas stream. Oh, and then I'm kind of torn on how the voting is going to work,

34
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,899
because you're probably I'm not going to stream for the next two days to get this already.

35
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:25,449
So the voting is probably going to be for one day only. You got to make sure you get your vote in.

36
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:37,420
But regardless, we will once we get about halfway through here. It's a Coca Cola classic is what

37
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:49,980
it is. Hey, look, it's Kenshi. This is exactly where we left off last night. Can you wait four

38
00:04:49,980 --> 00:05:01,819
hours so I can watch the VOD? No, just just put it on times 10 speed, and then add subtitles. I

39
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:08,649
haven't forgotten on me, but I just stopped it last night. So let's get in here. I haven't paused

40
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:18,459
if you missed the last stream. We ended up with these three thick up top thick on the bottom.

41
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:30,339
And the dog that is no longer starving to death just a little malnourished. So not bad. I still

42
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:39,660
have 1600 bucks. I don't have food. I have some decent food here. Name the squad. Oh, yeah, the

43
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:51,259
frog. How do I name them? Can you name the squad? Oh, yeah, that forgot that they look like they

44
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:59,319
could survive in a crash. What was that guy? That weird guy that crash test dummy thing.

45
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:18,180
But anywho, here they are. So the last thing that we were doing, click on SQD. Oh, here we go. So

46
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:34,779
let's go with does everybody have to be like a little frog? Right now they're just frog and dog.

47
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:47,910
Well, frogs, frogs and dogs. I'll get another dog. Three out of 20. Great Canadian just came

48
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:57,639
with 10 community subs right off the bat right now. Thank you so much. 10 community subscriptions.

49
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:06,709
Nice. I haven't even pressed unpause yet. But anyway, so we're working together. I did a little

50
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:15,339
bit of research. I read some things about athleticism. Athletics is just run speed.

51
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,069
So that's doesn't mean anything else. I don't think I looked up some stuff about attack,

52
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:25,300
defense, strength, how to strength train and all that stuff. So I know a little bit more.

53
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:38,230
So I need to go into a building that has a training dummies. And I'm not sure where they are here.

54
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:45,529
I gotta get out of here. No, but hey, hold on a second. My mind's running a mile a minute right

55
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:51,290
now because this whole New Year's Eve thing is has to happen real quick. And I got to put a

56
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:57,370
lot of time into it over the next couple of days. So I will explain the title in full detail. We're

57
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:02,170
going to go over that soon. This stream, I'm sorry, this stream is not going to be like

58
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:06,170
eight plus hours. Like I thought it was going to be, it's going to be cut short to lake.

59
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:12,810
I don't know, maybe four or five because I have to do a bunch of work and we got to get the

60
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,889
nominations in because I got the studio. It's confirmed. I'm in studio on New Year's Eve.

61
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:26,730
I got the confirmation already. So right now my brain is like, well, what about those categories?

62
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:32,460
And no, we're not into the stream. I'm going to go for like a good four hours and then we'll talk.

63
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:42,330
Okay. So let's go train. Jeremy, you forgot about something. Oh, are you sure about that?

64
00:08:43,049 --> 00:09:03,019
I don't think I did. You think I forgot about this? All right, let's go train. We need to find,

65
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:11,399
what do we need to find here? I got to find training dummies in this town and it said look

66
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:17,159
for a dome. Look for the dome building. Every major town has one and has training facilities

67
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:27,370
upstairs. I mean, this is a dome building, right? Just go in here. Facecam as a bonus character.

68
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:37,690
What city am I in right now? I'm currently in, this is world's end, I believe.

69
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:48,009
Nope, this is blister hill. Pump up the base. You sure you want me to do that? Put on the facecam.

70
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:53,299
But what if I don't want to? Where is this camera anyways? I don't even know.

71
00:09:58,169 --> 00:10:03,500
Here, I'll turn it up. Here, I'll give you a little boost of audio. Where do you want the cam?

72
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:09,750
I don't want to put the cam on. Where should I put it? Where even is it? I got clothes on, right?

73
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,370
It's in like a weird, it's too like far that way. You know what I mean? You're just, you're getting

74
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:25,480
like the side profile. What kind of like, what kind of facecam is this? I'm like clearly looking

75
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,409
just straight ahead. Don't need to be like in the gamer zone where like I'm, you can tell I'm looking

76
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:45,000
at the game. I feel like I should be on the front of a gorilla's album. No, it's going off. Let's go

77
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:57,909
train. Uh, up one floor. Are there training dummies in here? No, they're not training dummies in there.

78
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:03,850
Training dummies. Looking for training dummies. I saw them before, didn't I?

79
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:16,250
Fuck. What do they look like? I thought they were training dummies. Fuck. Training dummy? No.

80
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:34,409
I need to do this before I leave. Just buy a house and put a dummy in it. Does this town not have a

81
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:47,740
training dummy? I thought we saw before. Just hit people instead. No, I can't. Fuck. They look like

82
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:54,230
stick people. Yeah, like from like base or barracks or something maybe.

83
00:11:55,029 --> 00:12:12,710
Not gonna let me look in here. I don't know. Outside the walls. Are there some outside the walls?

84
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:28,980
Are you sure about that? Outside walls. You see any? I gotta find them. I can't really leave.

85
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:42,820
Outside walls. Outside walls. Fuck. Check the garage. I would think that maybe down here.

86
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:52,950
Right there, dude. It's right there, dude. Where? I'm getting a lot of right there, dude. And I'm

87
00:12:52,950 --> 00:13:01,190
like, where is that? Did I build this? Yes. This is my first city. Spent about two days making it.

88
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:06,389
That building. That building. That building. This building. Like this building.

89
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:23,159
Right there, dude. This is public. No, the other one. Not there. Bars aren't for... Yeah, this is a

90
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:34,340
bar. From my understanding, they look like they're like on top. Maybe this is not training dummies

91
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:42,149
in this town or something. Click on the map. I mean, wouldn't it? Should be here, right?

92
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:56,940
In the second gate, the building to the right is the barracks. Oh, yeah. All right. So,

93
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:06,330
am I allowed in here? This is open to the public. Let's go. I'm allowed to come up here.

94
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:21,340
We are allowed up there. Where are they? How far away is this place? Oh, there we go.

95
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:26,759
All right. So, we got... We have these training dummies. I'm allowed to use these, right?

96
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:34,519
So, let's go with Kandroth. We're going to train. Let's take a look. Start training.

97
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:40,330
There we go. And you, you are... How are you? Are you already trained high enough? I think you can

98
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:51,590
only train a certain level on these. Maybe not. Maybe I should give him the weapon. Can I not train

99
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:59,429
the dog? No, the dog's just constantly hungry. Back away from there. What? Are they talking to us?

100
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:15,529
That's private equipment. What? Why? Can I get one point before I leave? God damn it.

101
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:20,679
Come on. One point. One point and I'll leave. Stay away from there. That's private equipment.

102
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:24,379
One point. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

103
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:40,059
You just need one last little bit. Come on. Okay. Okay. How did I go down? I went down and

104
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:54,169
attacked. Somehow. Doesn't that make no sense? Wait a minute. Hold on. What? Combat. Melee attack

105
00:15:54,169 --> 00:16:03,509
two. See? Okay. I got, I did it. So, what did he, what is he at now? He's six? Okay. So, this is the

106
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:12,299
guy that needs that good weapon. Yeah. Well, that's not a bad weapon, but still. So, I need to open

107
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:19,129
up both of their inventories here. So, you need to put this away and I just go like this. How do I

108
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:26,470
have both open at the same time? Trade. Okay. So, you need this weapon because you are way better.

109
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:30,940
Let's trade. Because the other one is actually going to be doing damage. Let's see.

110
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:37,659
Five plus nine. What was it before? Six. Was it, was it more on the other one? Because he had.

111
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:50,279
So, that's nine defense now. So, what's the problem? You can't use this? Too heavy for you?

112
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:57,269
Ten. Attack point is minus two because I can't even use the damn thing. All right. Well,

113
00:16:57,269 --> 00:17:10,170
whatever. He's got ten attack. Well, I illegally up, leveled up my two carriages once. All right.

114
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:21,059
So, let's all go meet up and let's go try to make some money. I forgot how good this viral soundtrack

115
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:28,150
was. Are you coming, dog? Let's go. All right. Where are we going to go? I got, let's buy some

116
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:32,230
food. Let's get a good supply of actual food. I'm going to save it and we're going to go on an

117
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:47,460
adventure. Let's set up a bar. It's the closest bar. Over here, probably. Right here. Yeah. Yeah.

118
00:17:47,460 --> 00:18:11,130
Yeah. A little, a little band of weirdos. I love it. All right. Let's get in this way. Holding alt

119
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:17,910
highlight. Yeah. Wait. Right on the ground. All right. We need to trade. Let me see what you got.

120
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:23,339
What you've got. This is expensive. You don't have any more little meat sticks, do you?

121
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:27,799
It might be worth buying a few of these because they're very, uh, nutritious.

122
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:47,220
I mean, like, carry them both at the same time. Carry them both at the same time. So, I can afford

123
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:59,400
three, three, six, nine, twelve. I can afford to buy all three of these. Or no, actually, I can,

124
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:10,839
I can afford two, but they're very nutritious. And that's it. I got 200 bucks. I got the backpack

125
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:19,369
already full of food. Now, as long as one person has, uh, has stuff, they can, like, for instance,

126
00:19:19,369 --> 00:19:27,099
I have a bunch of stuff in my backpack. This is, this will feed everybody, right? I got a backpack

127
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:40,069
full of food. So, we're good. Time for, let's go. I'm ready to move. I don't, no, the dog's good.

128
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:49,269
We're good. The three of us are ready to go. We have weapons. We have a giant sack and it's time

129
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:57,190
to go. So, we're gonna go from here this time. I'm gonna go, we're gonna go down river and we're

130
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:02,329
gonna end up at some point over here. I don't know where this is gonna bring us, but we're gonna go.

131
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:12,200
Increase the music. Um, no, we're good. The music's fine where it is. I don't want it to overpower.

132
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:28,390
Here we go. See you later, suckers. Humble beginnings, guys. Eventually, they all have

133
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:40,279
30 people in a city. Are these bandits or? No, Holy Nation, that's fine. All right. What a perfect

134
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:51,690
RPG party. Following right behind each other. This is just my voice. We're gonna get a mining

135
00:20:51,690 --> 00:21:02,259
stream out of this? Uh, it's possible. That all depends on, uh, on a few factors. Everybody's

136
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:11,079
doing good with food. Except, why is it, uh, no, no one's eating. Okay. All right, slow it down.

137
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:19,319
Slow it down. Food. Now's our chance. Run them through. Wait a second. Hungry bandit leader.

138
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:25,220
Hungry bandit. Starving bandits. What do they have for, their attack is not that good.

139
00:21:26,329 --> 00:21:37,559
Four, five, turn around. Turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around. Go, go, go. This way.

140
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:51,750
Same, same way we came. Come on, bring them to the gate. They're cutting us off. I didn't save it. I

141
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,869
didn't save it. I didn't save it. I didn't save it. I didn't save it. We're not fast enough.

142
00:21:54,869 --> 00:22:05,430
I didn't save it. Where's the gate? Where? Come on. I need right here. Make it to right here.

143
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:23,269
Just run into the fucking town. We can make it. It's going to be fine. Go. Come on. 26 fucking

144
00:22:23,269 --> 00:22:41,609
damage. Really? Come on, dog. Why am I so much faster? The dog's gonna get left behind. I just

145
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:57,819
fed him. Come on, hurry. Get to the gate. All right. Bring it in. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

146
00:22:57,819 --> 00:23:03,369
Fight the, fight the bandits. Just bring them in the town. Bring them to the storm and guards

147
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:23,740
quickly. What the fuck is happening? All right. Let them fight. All right. We're good. This is

148
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:36,150
loot. Everybody's body. Perfect. Oh, you got a little bit of armor. I'll take it. Pants better.

149
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:45,369
Not really. Thanks for the free stuff, guards. Armor. Who doesn't have armor right now? We don't.

150
00:23:47,609 --> 00:24:02,980
Pants. What happened to my pants? A little weapon stick. What happened to the portrait? All right.

151
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:10,730
That's good. We got a little bit of armor out of that. You're under arrest. How are we doing? Okay.

152
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:19,700
Head. Dog is fine. Stomach. Right arm. I don't need to manage anything. We're fine. I don't think

153
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:27,019
it's necessary. Actually, right arm. Right arm going down. I'm going to need to heal that.

154
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:43,589
I don't have a med kit. Well, I do. First aid. There we go. Take their weapons. They're not dead.

155
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:52,420
They just KO'd. Really? Okay. Well, no. They're doing, they're doing good. All right. Back to

156
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,940
what we were doing. What we're doing. We're going this way. I'd be able to losing blood.

157
00:24:56,819 --> 00:25:14,569
No, we're all safe. Let me F5 it here. Wait, hold on. Okay. That just crashed the game. Thank

158
00:25:14,569 --> 00:25:31,190
God I pressed F5. Thank God I pressed that button. Lorag just gave $50 right now. Thank you, Lorag.

159
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:34,470
Hope yourself and everyone in chat enjoyed the holiday season. Wish you guys nothing but the

160
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:46,789
best in 2019. Thank you. Thank you so much for $50, Lorag. 50. Hope you had a great holiday season

161
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:55,859
as well. Again, if you're coming in and you don't know what the title means, New Year's Eve,

162
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,660
in a little bit, we are going to go over the whole thing again. I just want to make sure

163
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:12,539
people weren't confused. Thank God I did that. Awesome music. This is the Spyro 2 official,

164
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:28,259
official soundtrack. But yeah, Lorag, you've given a shitload of money. So thank you so much.

165
00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:38,119
But yes, I'm going to have to talk about it a handful of times on stream. No, no, no,

166
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:46,549
I was going to do that. Hey, whatever. Let's go. It's okay. Continue what we were doing before,

167
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:53,460
this way. It's going to be an award ceremony on New Year's Eve. Yeah, I'm going to be in the studio

168
00:26:53,460 --> 00:27:02,019
again. So should be a lot of fun. I'm going to, we'll talk about categories in a few hours

169
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:09,180
and the nomination process. And then there'll be a essentially like a 12 hour voting period

170
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:24,569
tomorrow. Awards for worst moments of 2018 on stream. So we're talking worst stream in 2018,

171
00:27:24,569 --> 00:27:33,700
worst joke, worst hair, uh, worst brand of soda, worst, uh, worst joke, worst joke that took more

172
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:40,440
than five minutes to make. It's going to be about 10 categories. There might even be more than that.

173
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:50,420
Uh, there'll be a, maybe like a couple of best dubs, but I'd really want to highlight the worst

174
00:27:50,420 --> 00:28:06,500
of the year. And then I'm going to present them and each one of the categories is going to get

175
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:12,730
its own nominee video clips. And I've got, I already did the Amazon order. I'm going to have

176
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:15,289
polio. I'm going to be in a suit is going to be going in front of the green screen.

177
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:26,819
There's going to be a presentation for each one. So we're going to go, because this was so last

178
00:28:26,819 --> 00:28:32,819
second, let me just make sure I'm safe to talk about this for a minute. Yeah, I am. Save it right

179
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:38,650
there. Is there ore right here? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. That's a, what is this?

180
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:48,410
That's huge. No way. Frog must get over here. Look at how big this is. What is this iron? No faction,

181
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:54,839
no workers. That's huge. That is a massive iron vein. That's a hundred percent quality.

182
00:29:00,089 --> 00:29:05,750
They can both do it at the same time. How many people can you have? Three people at a time

183
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:14,440
can work on this. Let's, let's do it. Just get a few of them, right? Just like make sure I have

184
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:25,720
enough money. Just give me a minute. Give me a minute. I'm going to put it into, now I'm going

185
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:40,980
to put it in my backpack because I'm the strong one. I don't think I should fill the backpack

186
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:54,019
though. Have frog carry massive moon so he gets it. This dog is not going to be able to ever walk.

187
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:08,329
May as well fill all of them to train spring. Yeah. How are we doing on food? We're good.

188
00:30:08,329 --> 00:30:14,279
Everybody's fed. We're good. Just got to get to another town. It's all about consistently staying

189
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:25,029
healthy while the whole keg gives up five community subs. Thank you. Okay. Five more

190
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:40,009
community subs. Sweet. Very, very, very kind of you. Thank you. But I'm so scared to walk around

191
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:45,670
over encumbered because when you do that, if somebody gets the jump on you, we're just going

192
00:30:45,670 --> 00:31:01,140
to die out there. He's building a worker strength, right? Yep. Should be. You're going to die either

193
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:07,579
way. Not with that attitude. Can you buy a horse or something? I don't know. I'm not sure.

194
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:19,450
I really don't know what this game has to offer. You can sneak while mining without a downside

195
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:44,680
to get sneak points. How do you sneakily mine? Tap the whole vein. That'll take all day.

196
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:49,480
All right. That's okay. I'm going to fill up his inventory with rocks so he can walk slower.

197
00:31:50,440 --> 00:32:02,660
Holy shit. Squards just gave out 10 community subs. That's like at least 30, 20, 30, 40 or

198
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:07,460
something community subs in the first 25 minutes, 30 minutes of the stream. Thank you guys so much.

199
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:20,700
What, he ate cookies? I don't even want to, where did I get cookies? Sign people jobs to stay

200
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:30,900
together? Yeah, that's a good idea. So a significant portion of this stream will be getting all the

201
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:35,849
categories set and giving all the rules for nominating and voting and everything. Holy shit.

202
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:43,400
Thank you Lake Drinker for five community subs. Thank you Anonymous Gifter for five community

203
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:50,819
subs. This is the high quality content. This is why everyone's given so many subs. Watching me

204
00:32:50,819 --> 00:33:04,099
mine a iron vein. Thank you for that. Really though, guys. Thank you. He's way over encumbered.

205
00:33:04,099 --> 00:33:14,039
This is it. We're out of here after this. That's good for now. Let's give you guys some jobs.

206
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:19,180
Everyone's over encumbered, right? They should be struggling to move. No, they're sneaking.

207
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:27,619
Well actually, if I sneak, doesn't that just build? Sneaking? It does, right? Hold on. If we just all

208
00:33:27,619 --> 00:33:39,099
sneak together. Stealth. All right, so hold on. So we have a shitload of weight down, so we're

209
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:51,160
building strength. We have sneaking, so we're building stealth, right? Yeah. Now that's a

210
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:58,059
900 IQ play right there. That's probably like what you're supposed to do. So I'm just going

211
00:33:58,059 --> 00:34:07,769
to sneak all the way to the next town. Let's get a quick save here. All right, let me get a good

212
00:34:07,769 --> 00:34:11,050
look at the map because I want to make sure nothing crazy is going to happen. So I'm going

213
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:16,900
to stay on the road. There's no reason to go off road, although there might be for whatever is over

214
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:28,150
here. What is this? A vein? What is it? A copper vein? I don't know. Now stay on course. Build up

215
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:36,059
stats. Sneak all the way to the next town on times 10 speed. Bet three with five community subs.

216
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:48,380
Thank you so much for the fucking subs. Now let's stay on the course. A hem hack. What?

217
00:34:49,579 --> 00:35:00,550
What's wrong? Is he all right? Harm unthrow, harm unthrow. She lived a life of anguish.

218
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:12,579
Oh, he's about to sing. For chained in rebirth, she was condemned to languish. Till one day,

219
00:35:12,579 --> 00:35:22,920
she'd been ravaged by the high paladin, most vile, and she swore her dark vengeance with a

220
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:34,119
murderous smile. Who the fuck did you get this song? She stashed a long nail, forged a blade.

221
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:41,219
Great- oh my lord. Great Canadian fuck club, 20 community subs, five community- five community

222
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:48,710
subs, a maxi Kaspersky. She killed all the guards. Uh, that- what the fuck? Who just gave 50- somebody

223
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:53,269
just gave 50 community subs. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is happening too fast.

224
00:35:53,750 --> 00:36:06,039
What happened? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Who's looking at us? Who's looking at us? Uh, I don't

225
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:15,239
understand who's staring at us. I'm panicking right now. Okay. All right. All right. Wait, wait, wait.

226
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:22,250
This is uh, I gotta say, I gotta look at this for a second because what on earth is going on? Did,

227
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:34,469
did somebody just give maxi Kaspersky five, great Canadian fuck club, 20, Torah tea, 50, and then

228
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:52,889
is it 100 or 50? 50? Wow. Uh, Torah, you guys are- you guys are out of control right now. Thank

229
00:36:52,889 --> 00:36:59,289
you. Rampaging Scruppa 5, Torah 50 community subs. That's- that's two- what, 250 fucking bucks?

230
00:37:00,329 --> 00:37:12,599
You just spent 250 dollars right now. Holy shit, guys. Did I ever say the F word? I'm sorry.

231
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:22,949
My goodness. I did not expect that today at all. I did not expect- I never expected, but

232
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:32,619
I appreciate it, guys. Thank you. And if you had a- if you got a community sub, awesome. Thanks a

233
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:40,619
lot, guys. But the real question is, what is- what is looking at me right now? Is there something

234
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:51,480
here? I don't know what I'm looking at. Wait, wait, wait, wait. It's a dog. Bone dog. Can I-

235
00:37:52,940 --> 00:38:03,800
Goal is attacking others. 14 attack and 12 strength. Why are you so good? What?

236
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:11,980
He's gonna kill us all. This thing's gonna kill us all right now. Is there, like, something I can

237
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:24,949
do? Oh my god, this is bad. Uh, we're all over encumbered. Wait, hold on. 6 plus 4 minus 11

238
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:35,539
and 5 versus- what's the defense on? What do you got for defense? Dexterity, toughness 14,

239
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:45,530
strength 12. Should we try to kill it? I think we have to run, but nobody can run. All right,

240
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:59,590
stop sneaking, everybody. Um, do I have to drop everything and run? I think I do. Drop all the

241
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:32,489
ore on the ground. Drop everything and fight. Fine. Okay. Okay. Ready? Drop the backpack.

242
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:41,829
The backpack has so many vital things that I can't drop the backpack. Drop the backpack. This is too

243
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:57,059
much important stuff. Oh my god, but what if- what- I don't know. Okay. I'm at minus 2, 5.

244
00:39:57,699 --> 00:40:03,480
Let's go. I think I'm ready. Get everybody selected here. Let's take on the dog. I'm ready.

245
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:19,099
So make sure everyone- we got everybody here. Everyone's selected. All right. Attack target.

246
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:32,489
Are we ready? Okay, here we go. Frog not selected. Oh shit. Why is the frog not selected? Oh, because

247
00:40:32,489 --> 00:40:37,030
you're all the way back here. What the hell are you doing back there? All right. Nobody's sneaking.

248
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:56,440
Here we go. Attack target. Three, two, one, action. Get him! Hit him! Somebody hit him!

249
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:06,900
He's so much bigger than my dog. Somebody hit the fucking dog. Get him! Nice. Okay. What's his

250
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:12,260
health at? He's almost dead. Left leg. Left. Cut his leg off. Cut his leg off. Cut his leg off.

251
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:28,550
Well, he's distracted. Get it! Do it! Kill him! Is he dead?

252
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:48,969
There's no winner in this battle. I don't- what do you mean I don't have a med kit?

253
00:41:49,690 --> 00:42:07,940
How do you not have a med kit? What? Oh, for the love of fucking god, everything's in the backpack.

254
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:28,969
Is anybody still alive? Dying. Dying. Dying. The character's unconscious. Character's unconscious.

255
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:56,659
How far away is that? That was 10 minutes ago? What do you mean no scumming? I have to scum this.

256
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:09,500
That was right when I was about to get on the road. Welcome to Kenshi. Welcome to the stream.

257
00:43:10,699 --> 00:43:18,710
Yeah. We're fine. We're fine. Look at this. We're back here. Same deal. Everything's good to go.

258
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:34,630
I'm sneaking. Building power. This time that dog's not going to be here because it happened

259
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:41,289
right here. So I didn't lose any time at all because that was- there was a shitload of community

260
00:43:41,289 --> 00:43:48,550
subs and I stopped. Yeah, we're good. We're fine. We're good to go. Dog is fine. Everyone's nice and

261
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:57,820
fed. Everyone's happy. Discovered Holy Farm. All right. Let's take a look. There's one here.

262
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:10,420
Holy Mines and Holy Farm. Let's pay a visit to the Holy Farm. I'm gonna save it right- hold on. Make

263
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:19,750
sure there's nothing here, right? Because if I save it here, we're good. Save it. Aren't you

264
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:32,300
wanted at the Holy Farm? I'm sure we'll find out. I don't see any enemies or anything. All right.

265
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:49,940
What's the next OST? To be fair, I'm on day 100 something. I have about 20 people. Tony Hawk.

266
00:44:50,659 --> 00:44:56,659
You want to put on the Tony Hawk OST? But I'm gonna get the whole- the channel- this is gonna

267
00:44:56,659 --> 00:45:28,659
get shut off. Too late. Yeah, rip the vlog. Oh, I'm not gonna put on the Tony Hawk soundtrack.

268
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:35,289
All right. How about just play it at like times two speed and pitch it down?

269
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:49,300
Dodge the filter. So I thought somebody said- somebody said Starbound. I thought you said

270
00:45:49,300 --> 00:46:00,090
Starbucks. I was like Starbucks does not have an OST. The Starbucks OST is like- now that's what

271
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:14,889
I call music volume eight. Put on Sneak King OST. Oh, that's the Burger King game. Who the

272
00:46:14,889 --> 00:46:20,739
hell would upload the Sneak King OST? Do you sit in your chair and you're like, you know what?

273
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:39,530
I think I'm gonna upload the Sneak King album today. No. It doesn't exist. It doesn't exist.

274
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:52,500
Yeah, I did Animal Crossing before. Simpsons hit and run. All right, I'm just gonna pick one. Let's

275
00:46:52,500 --> 00:47:06,179
go Starbound. Starbound OST. This is six and a half hours? This is six hours and 40 minutes

276
00:47:06,179 --> 00:47:18,360
of music in Starbound? What the fuck? Holy God. All right, here we go. We've saved it.

277
00:47:23,699 --> 00:47:34,679
Holy military base. All right. I need to train. I need to get my characters leveled up. They're so

278
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:47,659
shitty. Holy military bases here. Holy farm. Was I here before? No, I wasn't here before, was I?

279
00:47:48,300 --> 00:48:01,690
I was over at that one, wasn't it? Wait, what's wrong? What's going on here? I don't get it.

280
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:18,469
Heal yourself? I'm okay. Should I? I mean, if I'm at 93, 91, that's my left ink is bandaging. It's

281
00:48:18,469 --> 00:48:39,800
not urgent. This is so dumb. Sneaking everywhere. Why do I have a pelican mouth? It's red. You're

282
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:56,889
bleeding. All right. Well, first aid. Wolf den 657 has been wiped out. Wolf den. What does that

283
00:48:56,889 --> 00:49:05,480
mean? That keeps popping up. We can stop sneaking now. Let's just walk. I still have all the ore,

284
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:13,449
right? Yep. Somebody here want to buy it off me? Can we all go to the bathroom at the same time?

285
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:33,420
I mean, did I just hear shit noises? I think I actually did hear that. Did I? Am I making that

286
00:49:33,420 --> 00:50:21,019
up in my head? Hold on a minute. Did I make it up? Is he going to the bathroom? I thought he was

287
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:25,639
doing it too. That's just the way he stands. I might be just, my brain might have just been

288
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:37,480
making it up for some reason. All right. I need to get these guys jobs to follow. Follow me. Follow

289
00:50:38,039 --> 00:50:47,050
the job. That's good. It's just shift click. You stay close to me. You also stay close to me.

290
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:59,449
And also bodyguard. Staying close, bodyguard. Staying close, bodyguard. That works.

291
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:06,920
Let the dog go to the bathroom. The dog doesn't need to use an outhouse. Let's go back to

292
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:21,380
no reason within the music because obviously there is none right now. What is this music?

293
00:51:22,099 --> 00:51:55,769
Starbound OST. That was a good one. Public building. For sale? Whoa, whoa. This building's

294
00:51:55,769 --> 00:51:59,289
for sale. Some buildings are available for purchase. This panel will tell you how much

295
00:51:59,289 --> 00:52:06,650
the building costs. I could buy this for 12,800 C's. You can also often buy destroyed buildings

296
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:15,320
for a cheaper rate. You must repair the building before it can be used. Really? That's kind of

297
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:31,559
cool. Play at 0.5 speed. Can I steal this? All right. Well, this is, I can buy this building.

298
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:39,380
What about in here? This is a public building as well. Holding alt. Oh. Who is running this

299
00:52:39,380 --> 00:53:24,900
place? Oh, this person up here. I can't do that, man. I'm sorry. I can't handle that.

300
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:33,860
That was funny for five seconds. I need some good ambient, like Lord of the Rings music is

301
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:42,659
going to get this channel turned off. Uh, what about like, okay, Lord of the Rings royalty-free

302
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:58,300
music? Did somebody make a version that's royalty-free? Just do Skyrim. Hold on. Lord

303
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:14,599
of the Rings mix. Let's put this one on. All right. That sounds okay. Uh, looking to trade.

304
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:22,789
Let's see. No, this is not Lord of the Rings. This is a fake Lord of the Rings soundtrack.

305
00:54:22,789 --> 00:54:35,719
Okay. Sell price. Sell it all. Get some money. And change over to you. You got lots of stuff in your

306
00:54:35,719 --> 00:54:50,489
backpack. Speaking of backpacks, I wonder if I should have, uh, buy another one. This is designed

307
00:54:50,489 --> 00:55:00,840
to fit a bowl. You got raw meat? Oh, I will take that raw meat. Cotton. What am I going to do with

308
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:09,769
that? Arrange that again. I got some more food. I'm, I need to kind of get in a major town here.

309
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:36,940
He's, is he still mining iron and not? Oh, yeah. Hold on. Let me fix it. That's, that's times two.

310
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:55,559
Normal. There we go. This is not Lord of the Rings. All right. So that's all I can really do here.

311
00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:00,860
I do have some money. I don't know. What about animals? I can buy animals from this guy?

312
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:10,650
Talk to. Uh, got any animals for sale? Oh, would you look at that? What is this thing?

313
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:24,820
Look at this, this attack on the, I got what's 9,000. That was so good. 13 strength,

314
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:40,659
nine melee attack. I only have 1600 bucks. Can I buy like a baby cow? Anybody else want to join

315
00:56:40,659 --> 00:57:01,059
me on my journey? I can't talk to you. You just like, you just get out of the way and stay out of

316
00:57:01,059 --> 00:57:23,860
sight. Holy shit. What's in here? Oh, not worth it. Oh, there's a backpack. Bread. Oh, I didn't pay

317
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:33,530
attention to the, I just figured it was, I keep forgetting that when you open up a, when you open

318
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:38,650
up a box, there's a chance to steal. When it's on a table, you just, there's, there is no chance.

319
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:49,929
You just take it. Whatever. I really do want this though. God damn it. I keep forgetting that.

320
00:57:51,769 --> 00:58:17,260
Simpson's hit and run OST. I think that's all I can do. I sold everything. What is this doing in

321
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:42,179
here? Wait, stay together. Stay together. What's wrong with you? Why can't you run this? All right.

322
00:58:42,179 --> 00:58:55,059
No more Simpson's songs. Okay. I need something ambient, not like TV show theme songs blasting

323
00:58:55,059 --> 00:59:04,150
in my fucking ear. That's just the McDonald's theme song guys. Where do you think they got it from?

324
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:46,380
No, no, no, no. Slow it down. A halo OST. McDonald's OST. All right, let's go. I sold all my shit.

325
00:59:47,019 --> 00:59:52,920
I need to move down here, almost to this river. I'm maybe, go through like the purple zone maybe.

326
00:59:53,559 --> 01:00:16,730
Let's go boys. I'm loving it. The Simpson. All righty then.

327
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:48,250
This is just Ace Ventura. Did you say boomer show? Ace Ventura is a movie starring Jim Carrey

328
01:00:49,739 --> 01:01:00,250
And it is a classic. A little post here. I feel like I should build a little town or like at least a shack

329
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:08,219
What is that though? Hold on. What is this?

330
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Is there a campfire over there? No

331
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:19,929
Song? A fly flew up my nose. Just get a grip

332
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,280
All right, there it is

333
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,679
Small copper resource. That's worth a lot of money

334
01:01:29,639 --> 01:01:35,590
And the sandstorm

335
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:45,739
Let's get some copper

336
01:01:45,739 --> 01:01:46,860
because

337
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:49,900
Uh, this one's 80. So don't mind the one back there

338
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,639
Same thing

339
01:01:53,639 --> 01:01:55,639
Line it up. Sell it in town

340
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,119
Train

341
01:01:58,119 --> 01:02:02,980
Both work together on this, please

342
01:02:04,139 --> 01:02:06,300
Excuse me. Work together on this, please

343
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:12,309
Excuse me

344
01:02:12,309 --> 01:02:14,309
Is there a reason why you're not working on this, please?

345
01:02:15,030 --> 01:02:20,539
Only one work is allowed on here

346
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:24,230
Oh god damn it really

347
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:30,340
laboring 37

348
01:02:30,579 --> 01:02:32,579
What do you have for laboring stuff?

349
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:37,260
Nine

350
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:39,820
Uh versus 37. Yeah, you're gonna be the one doing it

351
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,400
Send the other guy back and forth to sell stuff

352
01:02:52,659 --> 01:02:55,059
All right, well that's a good soundtrack

353
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:58,070
But I don't want to hear it anymore

354
01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:23,579
Is this gonna do anything?

355
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:31,579
This is a this is a silent video

356
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:33,420
This is a screamer

357
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:40,840
Okay, that was that video was 15 seconds long

358
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:45,500
And after nine to ten seconds that played

359
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,500
Is this better?

360
01:03:52,739 --> 01:03:54,500
What the fuck

361
01:03:54,500 --> 01:04:00,070
Is this from like the 80s?

362
01:04:08,619 --> 01:04:10,619
I don't what that was that a

363
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:22,380
You can't apparently find it

364
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:37,349
How does how has nobody uploaded a high quality version of that? I have no idea put halo back on

365
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:53,269
Zootopia

366
01:04:53,269 --> 01:04:56,389
How about how about super mario rpg? That's a good one

367
01:05:05,659 --> 01:05:13,019
That's what i'm talking about. Let's go

368
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:16,780
Let's go. Can I get some hypes in the chat, please? Can I get some hype in the chat guys?

369
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:20,739
You know what I'm saying typing like hype space. Yeah, baby

370
01:05:21,619 --> 01:05:23,059
You know what i'm saying?

371
01:05:23,059 --> 01:05:35,239
Fucking worst word in the english dictionary

372
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:46,630
That's it. What what happened to my youtube player? What it broke? What?

373
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:53,349
How am I still on the internet? Am I still like alive?

374
01:05:56,039 --> 01:05:57,400
Okay

375
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,400
Can I get some hypes in the chat, please?

376
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:48,070
Holy shit make the other dude do something

377
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:53,030
But I don't have anything for him to do. Is there another? Oh, but there's a vein right here

378
01:06:53,829 --> 01:06:55,829
That one's like a low quality vein

379
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:00,389
Well, he can get the low quality one

380
01:07:04,409 --> 01:07:07,210
Me and me

381
01:07:07,210 --> 01:07:09,369
I'm serious. What was that? Was that me talking?

382
01:07:09,929 --> 01:07:52,789
Who was it? All right, you're on that one. You're on that one

383
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:59,190
Here we go

384
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:06,150
Do

385
01:08:09,110 --> 01:08:13,909
Hey, what a great stream I got a nomination for worst stream of 2018

386
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:58,229
I wonder what you guys think it's gonna be sneak. I'm sneak. You're right. Good idea

387
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:19,960
tmnt

388
01:09:20,619 --> 01:09:23,579
Hey, like can I get like a quick, uh hype in the chat if you think this is cool

389
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:30,069
How okay? No, no, no for real. I don't do that. But I think a real question. How often do people ask to do hype in the chat?

390
01:09:30,789 --> 01:09:32,789
like on other like youtubers

391
01:09:33,989 --> 01:09:38,789
Is that like is that actually a thing that people do there's no nobody does that right?

392
01:09:40,149 --> 01:09:42,149
Am I like i'm making that whole thing up

393
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:50,729
Like nobody actually says that people always make it like the joke

394
01:09:51,369 --> 01:10:11,380
I only got one it's the menu theme

395
01:10:12,659 --> 01:10:17,399
I'm just gonna fill one bag and then we can go

396
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:28,739
But this is how you get everyone stronger except for the dog who's just eating food

397
01:10:31,239 --> 01:10:35,159
I have a food consumer. That's all the dog has done so far

398
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:45,460
No more osts

399
01:10:53,539 --> 01:10:59,319
You don't like osts

400
01:10:59,319 --> 01:11:01,319
How about just something easy in the background?

401
01:11:08,329 --> 01:11:11,140
uh, let's do

402
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:13,399
ambient

403
01:11:13,399 --> 01:11:15,399
relaxing music

404
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:19,210
Calm space ambient or deep sleep help

405
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:24,409
It's supposed to help with you to get you into deep sleep

406
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:30,359
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Hold on pause it

407
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:34,840
Oh

408
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:42,409
Thank god, we're sneaking everybody stop what you're doing. Where'd you go? Don't start singing here. Where is he?

409
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:48,840
Are you right there? You're like blending with the ground stop what you're doing

410
01:11:50,279 --> 01:11:52,279
Don't hit that don't mind that

411
01:11:53,079 --> 01:11:56,979
both of you stop

412
01:11:56,979 --> 01:12:01,720
Wait for these bandits to pass

413
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:25,699
This is not good. I'm warning stop talking to each other. I think we're safe

414
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:31,819
Well, I don't know what what does this wolf den thing mean? I think I gotta move

415
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:36,470
No, don't go that way. Are you crazy?

416
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:41,189
Are they just gonna stay on the road?

417
01:12:41,189 --> 01:12:47,420
All right, they're gone. All right, good back to what you were doing both of you

418
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:54,920
All right, that's one full bag of copper

419
01:12:55,800 --> 01:13:05,909
I feel like we should get maybe a couple more and then after this we're going to turn off the ost

420
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:16,789
Both of them and then we're going to play in-game sound effect

421
01:13:21,909 --> 01:13:23,909
So who can hold this?

422
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:32,279

423
01:13:32,279 --> 01:13:35,239

424
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:39,050

438
01:14:44,739 --> 01:14:49,210

439
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:51,210

450
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:51,989
Why am I sneaking because it doesn't matter as long as you're sneaking and doing something you get points towards stealth

451
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:59,100

He's got armor. Uh, what kind of armor do you have? That's pretty nice armor

01:22:53,619 --> 01:22:55,800
How do I make sure he doesn't wake up?

525
01:22:56,039 --> 01:23:10,600
What should I do with him?

526

01:25:52,039 --> 01:26:02,949
Is he just waiting for him to stand up?

561
01:26:05,659 --> 01:26:07,659
He's in a recovery combo

562
01:26:07,659 --> 01:26:12,149
Well, then i'm just gonna this is gonna be my training dummy

563
01:26:12,789 --> 01:26:19,449
I'm just gonna carry him around until he wakes up

How many of these am I using not very many? Okay, he's almost at full health

01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:52,340
This poor guy look, i'm sorry you were the one person wandering around

568
01:26:57,930 --> 01:26:59,689
All right, let's get

569
01:26:59,689 --> 01:27:02,060
How are we doing on uh?

570
01:27:04,439 --> 01:27:06,600
All right, I can get like another few

571
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:11,060
All right, that's fine

572
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:13,060
It's just gonna recover on my shoulder

573
01:27:13,779 --> 01:27:19,930
Almost there

574
01:27:19,930 --> 01:27:28,819
But desperate times call for desperate measures, you know, okay

575
01:27:35,289 --> 01:27:37,850
Use him as a spare ore backpack

576
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:49,340
All right, one more. That's it one. Nah, look at that could get a whole entire inventory and then have tons of money

577
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:59,670
I wouldn't mean I can

578
01:28:03,189 --> 01:28:07,829
You know what? I can you're right. I could just put it but what if I what if he gets up and runs away somehow?

579
01:28:21,689 --> 01:28:25,770
He can't run away with all the ore on him because he'll be weighed down. You know, that's true

580
01:28:27,050 --> 01:28:29,050
He'll be too

581
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:33,909
Like

582
01:28:34,630 --> 01:28:38,789
Uh, why am I getting tired?

583
01:28:39,859 --> 01:28:41,859
Why am I slowing down here? Excuse me

584
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:53,479
All right, let's put him down

585
01:28:53,479 --> 01:28:55,479
Uh put his body down

586
01:28:57,270 --> 01:28:59,510
Okay, let's see

588
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:04,859
Everybody get ready

589
01:29:04,859 --> 01:29:11,739
He's gonna get up

590
01:29:11,739 --> 01:29:13,739
He's gonna wake up in

591
01:29:14,199 --> 01:29:19,210
Quick weigh him down weigh him down quick in case he runs

592
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:43,640
Okay, you ain't going anywhere

593
01:29:45,930 --> 01:29:52,979
Now let's get everybody selected just gonna get up in a second here

594
01:30:05,670 --> 01:30:07,529
uh

595
01:30:07,529 --> 01:30:09,529
Nice day. Hey

596
01:30:10,810 --> 01:30:12,810
All right. Well I did what I wanted to do

597
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:16,340
You get over there and mine this one again

598
01:30:25,079 --> 01:30:27,079
That freed up the backpack

599
01:30:31,989 --> 01:30:33,989
keep an eye on him because

600
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:36,869
I if he gets up and runs away, i'll be very very sad

601
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:43,800
Save it now. You're right. Yes, you're right

602
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:56,310
So I got so many backpacks full of money i'm gonna be able to buy a house for us to live

603
01:30:57,649 --> 01:31:00,899
finally

604
01:31:00,899 --> 01:31:06,340
Second backpack guy is perfect. And when he gets up I can take this stuff off him and then we can we can hurt him again

605
01:31:06,819 --> 01:31:08,819
We level up our sword skills

606
01:31:15,939 --> 01:31:18,739
Recovery coma minus 34. I gotta be ready for when that happens

607
01:31:19,779 --> 01:31:31,560
Should be pretty close

608
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:33,640
You so bad at mining dude, come on

609
01:31:37,449 --> 01:31:39,770
Dog yeah, we need some more food. We gotta get to a town

610
01:31:40,649 --> 01:31:45,850
We should be fine until we get there though. How you doing minus 31. Let's get a while

611
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:52,439
whoa, whoa

612
01:31:52,439 --> 01:31:55,560
Hungry bandits. I don't think they can see us though. They're too far away

613
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:05,739
Yeah, they stay on the road. It looks like unless don't come down here

614
01:32:06,699 --> 01:32:21,930
We're not coming down here good. We're safe. Should be sneaking. You're right

615
01:32:22,649 --> 01:32:29,750
This is day two in a row of mining

616
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:36,340
Almost done and we're not gonna have to do this again for a long time

617
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:40,939
Trust me

618
01:32:40,939 --> 01:32:47,399
Save the game. I did

619
01:32:47,399 --> 01:32:49,399
How's our friend doing 27

620
01:32:53,289 --> 01:32:54,970
Uh for litty

621
01:32:54,970 --> 01:32:56,970

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you

623
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:05,180
There's a lot of those tonight

624
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:07,659
It's time to go in about 25 seconds

625
01:33:08,619 --> 01:33:10,220
Maybe a little less

626
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:13,000
We have enough room for one two, three, four, five six

627
01:33:15,079 --> 01:33:17,800
All right. What do they stand up when they get to zero, right?

628
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:30,920
End of the mining voice. Yeah, it's getting close

629
01:33:31,479 --> 01:33:35,380
What am I gonna do about the guys weight?

630
01:33:35,979 --> 01:33:38,140
I'm gonna carry him. Someone's gonna carry him

631
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:47,420
Packable holy nation. Okay, that's fine

632
01:33:48,220 --> 01:33:50,710
This guy's not affiliated with the holy nation. So

633
01:33:57,479 --> 01:34:00,359
My labor has to be so high on this character at this point really

634
01:34:04,949 --> 01:34:06,949
One two, three three more

635
01:34:14,390 --> 01:34:18,069
Minus 28. Okay, I got time. You know, we're gonna put them over there and just kill them again

636
01:34:21,079 --> 01:34:23,479
Collie Brady, thanks for the five community subs collie brady

637
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:27,000
Thank you

638
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:32,600
community subs

639
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:36,710
One more wait

640
01:34:36,710 --> 01:34:39,189
I just i'm sorry. I actually got scared. No, it's me talking

641
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:43,720
I saw the text and I freaked out. I'm sorry. I just screamed one more and that's it

642
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:52,149
Okay

643
01:34:52,149 --> 01:34:53,029
Done

644
01:34:53,029 --> 01:34:55,590
I have so many we're good

645
01:34:56,390 --> 01:34:58,229
Everybody regroup

646
01:34:58,229 --> 01:35:06,279
So let's take a look at what we got

647
01:35:06,279 --> 01:35:08,279
Everybody's sneaking still right? So

648
01:35:09,819 --> 01:35:11,819
We have one

649
01:35:12,859 --> 01:35:14,859
one, two, three

650
01:35:14,939 --> 01:35:16,649
four

651
01:35:16,649 --> 01:35:17,689
bags

652
01:35:17,689 --> 01:35:21,000
This guy's gonna get up very soon and when he does we kill him again

653
01:35:21,479 --> 01:35:23,560
So who has the strength to pick him up? Probably you

654
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:36,539
Stealth ko him. No pick him up. I got my four backpacks

655
01:35:37,340 --> 01:35:39,579
Let's all stay together

656
01:35:39,659 --> 01:35:42,979
So i'm gonna give you the job to follow

657
01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:45,689
you

658
01:35:45,689 --> 01:35:46,810
follow

659
01:35:46,810 --> 01:35:49,529
All right

660
01:35:49,529 --> 01:35:55,529
Let's move save

661
01:35:55,609 --> 01:35:57,609
Here's the real question. Where the hell am I gonna go?

662
01:35:59,319 --> 01:36:01,319
I could go back here

663
01:36:01,850 --> 01:36:03,850
to blister hill

664
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:08,779
I could could I build a base should I build a base here?

665
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:11,750
I could just keep going but i'm out of food though

666
01:36:12,550 --> 01:36:23,659
I mean, this is the easiest one. Although i'm not sure where a town is

667
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:28,649
I can go down to this. Let's just take a look and see what's on this road

668
01:36:29,529 --> 01:36:38,550
Wait to this guy's gonna get up in a minute. I need to be prepared when he does

669
01:36:41,220 --> 01:36:44,420
Explain the rules for new years

670
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:45,939
Not in a minute

671
01:36:45,939 --> 01:36:52,279
Minus 15 still out

672
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:55,539
Are we all sneaking?

673
01:36:55,539 --> 01:37:00,199
Now we are safe before the trip. Yeah, I will

674
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:02,760
Let's make sure everyone's ready to go

675
01:37:03,159 --> 01:37:13,779
I'm sure I don't I gotta be careful on the road though because of bandits and this dude's gonna wake up soon

676
01:37:13,779 --> 01:37:15,779
So I kind of need to go off the road

677
01:37:15,939 --> 01:37:21,220
Yeah, there's gonna be a new year's thing. We're gonna go over it. It's gonna be a significant portion of this stream

678
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,939
discovered stack

679
01:37:27,939 --> 01:37:31,180
Well, there's stack

680
01:37:34,119 --> 01:37:36,119
Looks like we're going there

681
01:37:38,380 --> 01:37:41,979
All right. I don't see anybody on the road, but uh, i'm gonna keep an eye on i'm gonna keep my eye on him

682
01:37:42,859 --> 01:37:49,319
Because once that gets to be about minus 10

683
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:54,279
From my he's when is he actually gonna get up minus 10 or zero?

684
01:37:55,079 --> 01:38:08,739
in a second to load

685
01:38:08,739 --> 01:38:13,140
Because this was such all right. Let me just break it down because there are quite a few people here now

686
01:38:13,859 --> 01:38:16,260
So I might as well just go over it

687
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:18,819
So there was this was a very very last minute thing

688
01:38:20,550 --> 01:38:22,550
I don't know if whoever was here yesterday

689
01:38:23,029 --> 01:38:25,590
We talked about what was the worst stream that I did this year

690
01:38:26,149 --> 01:38:28,710
And people were saying oh this one this one. It was just a joke, right?

691
01:38:29,350 --> 01:38:30,390
but then

692
01:38:30,390 --> 01:38:32,069
earlier today

693
01:38:32,149 --> 01:38:33,850
Sitting in the chat

694
01:38:33,850 --> 01:38:35,050
And it was

695
01:38:35,050 --> 01:38:37,050
Hey, like wouldn't that be kind of funny?

696
01:38:37,460 --> 01:38:39,460
If we just did an award ceremony

697
01:38:39,779 --> 01:38:42,819
Where I go to the studio and I set up a podium and shit and I get in a suit

698
01:38:43,619 --> 01:38:46,420
And we do a full 10 to 15 category

699
01:38:47,140 --> 01:38:49,140
Worst stuff I did this year

700
01:38:51,850 --> 01:38:55,689
And as like maybe like a couple of best of what happened this year, maybe

701
01:38:57,109 --> 01:39:00,550
And we're talking that's the thing about categories is because this came up so

702
01:39:02,149 --> 01:39:04,390
It wasn't very long ago, right? It was so recent

703
01:39:05,109 --> 01:39:06,359
that

704
01:39:06,359 --> 01:39:09,319
A significant portion of this stream is going to be coming up with categories

705
01:39:14,060 --> 01:39:16,010
so

706
01:39:16,010 --> 01:39:19,529
That we're going to do that. I have like probably seven or eight that I want to do

707
01:39:20,010 --> 01:39:22,649
But we need to come up with some before the stream is over

708
01:39:23,130 --> 01:39:27,850
So then you guys can nominate there's a channel in the discord that's currently locked because it's not you know

709
01:39:27,930 --> 01:39:29,930
Whoever's not ready to do it yet

710
01:39:30,010 --> 01:39:32,729
So after we do the categories

711
01:39:33,529 --> 01:39:35,630
Then you guys are going to give nominations

712
01:39:37,020 --> 01:39:38,859
And then a day from now

713
01:39:38,859 --> 01:39:42,000
I'm going to close the nominations

714
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:46,399
You're going to vote in the discord because i'm going to put a poll up in the discord because i'm not going to be streaming over

715
01:39:46,399 --> 01:39:47,680
The next two days

716
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:52,350
Because this is going to take a lot of time to get ready

717
01:39:52,350 --> 01:39:53,229
so

718
01:39:53,229 --> 01:39:56,029
After today's stream the next stream will be on new year's eve

719
01:39:58,079 --> 01:40:00,829
Because i'm going to cut up videos

720
01:40:00,909 --> 01:40:02,750
with all the nominees

721
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:07,159
So let's say it's like worst overall stream of 2018 is the final obviously final

722
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:10,079
Award

723
01:40:10,079 --> 01:40:15,119
I'm going to just whatever the nominees are i'm going to it's going to be here are the nominees and here is a presentation of

724
01:40:15,119 --> 01:40:16,800
the worst streams

725
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,859
the worst jokes

726
01:40:18,859 --> 01:40:22,060
You know, i'm going to do 10 15 different categorical videos

727
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:38,039
That's what's going to happen and i'm going to obviously give a speech for every category to talk about what I feel about it

728
01:40:47,390 --> 01:40:54,670
Worst frame was your wow one. That wasn't 2018 though. I'm pretty sure that was 2017

729
01:41:03,420 --> 01:41:05,420
Stop the yoga music. All right. Yeah

730
01:41:12,279 --> 01:41:14,279
Worst new character is going to be one

731
01:41:24,430 --> 01:41:25,630
Yeah

732
01:41:25,630 --> 01:41:32,140
Yeah, the worst joke there's going to be worst overall joke of 2018 and then there's going to be other categories as well

733
01:41:32,699 --> 01:41:33,899
as if

734
01:41:33,899 --> 01:41:35,100
as if

735
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:38,430
What was I trying to say there like?

736
01:41:38,909 --> 01:41:41,279
Ie is what I was trying to say

737
01:41:41,279 --> 01:41:43,920
Worst joke that took at least five minutes to set up

738
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:52,380
Worst noise like the fucking worst noise i've made

739
01:41:53,020 --> 01:41:58,329
all year

740
01:41:58,329 --> 01:42:08,039
Worst voice impression there's plenty of categories we can come up with here the worst haircut. Absolutely

741
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:12,840
And then you'll see clips of all the different worst hairs that have happened over the years

742
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:14,840
And you're gonna pick what the worst fucking one was

743
01:42:15,159 --> 01:42:19,640
No, let's turn that off now. Turn it back on

744
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:22,960
worst category

745
01:42:33,770 --> 01:42:35,449
All right, let's go to

746
01:42:35,449 --> 01:42:37,130
Let's get something else

747
01:42:37,130 --> 01:42:40,329
How about gym music?

748
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:43,600
best workout music mix

749
01:42:52,409 --> 01:42:54,569

760
01:44:12,279 --> 01:44:21,039

761
01:44:21,039 --> 01:44:24,279

766
01:45:32,359 --> 01:45:35,319
You know what happens when you wake up like this your bag is full of gold

767
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:41,479
You have money in your bag and there's three people dead and they all have the same material on them

768
01:45:49,720 --> 01:46:06,909
Wait a minute. We're okay. I can level up my first day. I don't have a med kid

769
01:46:07,710 --> 01:46:26,109
That's we're okay. What's about what he's coming up with? Come on. Okay first day

771
01:46:52,090 --> 01:46:57,609

772
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:06,859

No, he's waking up. No, no, no. No, come on

775
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:18,779
What's he gonna do?

776
01:47:18,779 --> 01:47:23,149
Just keep an eye on him. The dog is dying

777
01:47:27,279 --> 01:48:33,359
Heal the dog. I need to you don't have a weapon take out your weapon. What's take out your weapon?

778
01:48:33,359 --> 01:48:44,750
Why am I not using my weapon? Wait, it's because my arms are both

779
01:48:45,369 --> 01:48:48,109
Broken and i'm flailing them around like spaghetti

780
01:48:54,140 --> 01:49:01,149
I got him. Do I have a splint?

781
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:07,319
That's it. Are you alive?

01:49:07,319 --> 01:49:15,069
They're dying and shit. This is not I have to let him go. I have to let this guy go with all the ore

783
01:49:17,289 --> 01:49:40,619

784
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:56,720
I have to let him go. I got attacked by wild wolves and then that was it

785
01:49:58,970 --> 01:50:03,689
Congratulations, I hope you enjoy. I hope you enjoy all the fucking free ore because I can't I have

786
01:50:04,909 --> 01:50:06,909
I gotta go back and heal everybody

787
01:50:11,340 --> 01:50:14,060
I'm too weak. Yes. I am too weak. All right, who needs it the most?

788
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:28,600
You're all right. You are not all right. Give me another med kit. I need to drop some splints

01:50:57,359 --> 01:50:59,760
Reload and pick up ore before he wakes up

794
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:02,560
No, it's too no I gotta

01:51:04,220 --> 01:51:06,220
All right dog is in recovery coma

796
01:51:06,699 --> 01:51:16,939
You need to be healed as well

797
01:51:17,020 --> 01:51:20,060
At some point. I can't just redo every one of my mistakes

798
01:51:20,699 --> 01:51:27,789
Plus I need this to happen

799
01:51:27,789 --> 01:51:30,829
Because I have to take the damage you have to get better

800
01:51:31,369 --> 01:51:32,989
Toughness is important

801
01:51:32,989 --> 01:51:36,119
Okay, do I have it? I got a splint

802
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:38,520
I need to have splint my arm

01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:48,670
How do I splint my own arm? So i'm all right candor off is fine

804
01:51:49,310 --> 01:51:51,130
Needs to recover

805
01:51:51,130 --> 01:51:55,640
I'm gonna have to pick up both of the animals. I mean both people

806
01:51:56,729 --> 01:51:58,729
I'm all fucked up. Give me some

01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:03,600
Well getting the use out of these that's for sure

808
01:52:04,399 --> 01:52:12,489
Can I carry both people? I think I can carry them both

809
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:15,560
But I have one fucked up arm

810
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:24,750
Okay

811
01:52:24,750 --> 01:52:26,750
Splint my injuries

812
01:52:29,159 --> 01:52:31,800
Uh, is it not splinted? How many splints do I need?

813
01:52:32,600 --> 01:52:41,920
No, it's splinted, right?

814
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:45,390
Okay

815
01:52:45,390 --> 01:52:46,590

817
01:52:49,359 --> 01:52:52,220
Okay

818
01:52:52,220 --> 01:53:09,439
Why did I splint the wrong arm?

819
01:53:09,439 --> 01:53:12,880
I can't I can't pick him up with this arm

820
01:53:17,710 --> 01:53:22,079
Well, hold on what's wrong with me

821
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:28,300
Oh boy, there's food

822
01:53:30,279 --> 01:53:36,359
I need to that's worth money

823
01:53:41,819 --> 01:53:43,579
You need to get up

824
01:53:43,579 --> 01:53:48,060
This is so dangerous being on this road with I can't just stay here. I have to all right

825
01:53:51,239 --> 01:53:56,359
You're gonna get up. We're gonna hide over here

826
01:53:56,359 --> 01:53:58,359
Away from any bad bandits

827
01:53:58,600 --> 01:54:17,079
I'll make a campfire. We'll eat

828
01:54:17,079 --> 01:54:18,119
Right here

829
01:54:18,119 --> 01:54:22,600
And then I need okay. I got some food

830
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:27,199
I need to go a little further out right here

831
01:54:32,939 --> 01:54:44,010
Up. Okay. I just splinted the dog campfire

832
01:54:48,909 --> 01:54:59,439
Campfire camping camp bed doesn't cost anything but a campfire here anywhere in the wild

833
01:55:01,050 --> 01:55:04,329
Uh, oh that was weird. Okay right here

834
01:55:05,399 --> 01:55:07,399
And then we're gonna make a campbed

835
01:55:07,399 --> 01:55:08,760
right here

836
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:15,319
Make three of them

837
01:55:15,319 --> 01:55:21,770
Building why are you standing in the fire? All right building. Wait, I didn't did I can't make those

838
01:55:22,939 --> 01:55:24,939
Three of them for three people to be in the bed

839
01:55:25,420 --> 01:55:29,130
Select a construction to check its status

840
01:55:29,130 --> 01:55:33,689
This shows how many building materials I need to complete the construction once the condition is bar filled the construction is complete

841
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:37,960
build

842
01:55:37,960 --> 01:55:39,239
I need

843
01:55:39,239 --> 01:55:43,069
What do I need?

844
01:55:43,069 --> 01:55:48,670
Sleeping bag one more building material will be needed. Why need one sleeping bag? Well, all right, whatever cook the food

845
01:55:54,479 --> 01:55:59,340
Don't eat them both

846
01:55:59,340 --> 01:56:05,760
All right, how are we doing recovery coma with dog recovery coma?

847
01:56:09,550 --> 01:56:12,039
All right

848
01:56:12,039 --> 01:56:14,279
Uh, I guess now i'm just gonna sit here

849
01:56:17,949 --> 01:56:20,590
I'm off the road. I should be away from anybody

850
01:56:21,310 --> 01:56:26,800
I don't have any sleeping bags. So I can't do that take off taunt

851
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:30,800
They're gonna be in a coma for a long time

852
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:34,039
Save the game

853
01:56:34,039 --> 01:56:39,869
So this is like post attack. We got attacked

854
01:56:44,039 --> 01:56:46,779
All right now

855
01:56:46,779 --> 01:56:48,779
We times three idle

856
01:56:49,390 --> 01:56:51,390
Wait, hold on. Is there anything I can get?

857
01:56:51,630 --> 01:56:53,630
I need to go maybe look for supplies or something

858
01:56:56,510 --> 01:56:57,789
What's over here?

859
01:56:57,789 --> 01:57:08,920
Is there anything I can do here?

860
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:11,390
Right arm is getting better

861
01:57:11,390 --> 01:57:13,340
very slowly

862
01:57:13,340 --> 01:57:16,140
I don't think this is anything. Can I fit any more stuff?

863
01:57:16,779 --> 01:57:20,430
Because I know that there is

864
01:57:20,430 --> 01:57:22,750
A few things over here animal teeth. I think I can pick them up

865
01:57:27,369 --> 01:57:28,329
um

866
01:57:28,329 --> 01:57:31,039
I can't

867
01:57:31,039 --> 01:57:35,739
I still have this meat. I need to get rid of uh, I need to put this back on him

868
01:57:36,460 --> 01:57:37,899
I need to go back

869
01:57:37,899 --> 01:57:50,840
Okay

870
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:53,680
trade

871
01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:56,000
So I need to put away some of this stuff

872
01:57:58,199 --> 01:58:00,409
He's stacked, right?

873
01:58:00,409 --> 01:58:03,119
Why not?

874
01:58:03,119 --> 01:58:06,960
Oh fuck who ate it? Did I eat that? He's the only person that's eaten

875
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:12,029
I need to be able to take the skin and there's another thing of meat over there

876
01:58:21,979 --> 01:58:32,920
Can't pick that up. Why is it longer than that? I mean what was that all about?

877
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:35,319
All right, that's good

878
01:58:35,319 --> 01:58:44,810
Okay cook the meat

879
01:58:44,810 --> 01:58:46,810
Should just do it automatically, right?

880
01:58:46,810 --> 01:58:50,329
Yeah

881
01:58:50,329 --> 01:58:51,770
What was that noise?

882
01:58:51,770 --> 01:59:04,010
Seriously though, what was that?

883
01:59:04,010 --> 01:59:06,010
Whoa, no get away from me

884
01:59:07,319 --> 01:59:10,039
What are you doing over here? Why are you over here? Uh

885
01:59:12,670 --> 01:59:14,750
What are you doing here? Is he gonna know?

886
01:59:16,409 --> 01:59:19,369
I have to sneak away, but is he gonna see these two?

887
01:59:20,359 --> 01:59:22,520
He smells the meat you asshole

888
02:00:01,119 --> 02:00:07,840
I have a crippled arm. Can I play dead?

889
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:12,800
Hold on. How do I play dead?

890
02:00:25,470 --> 02:00:46,399
Where's play dead? He's going the other way. Oh, come on

891
02:00:47,619 --> 02:00:54,409
RNG, please be in my favor go the other way and I get that meat out of there

892
02:00:54,810 --> 02:01:13,039
Okay, that's fine. Good play dead play dead. What do you guys got on recovery time? So long

893
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:15,960
You not so much but can carry the dog

894
02:01:16,039 --> 02:01:23,710
Okay, I think it's time. I'm just gonna sneak back and forth like this while I do times three speed

895
02:01:58,170 --> 02:02:03,720
Fight with honor. You can't fight with honor with a broken arm against 15 people

896
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:12,699
We gotta move cam. I gotta pick some I gotta pick you up and we gotta go

897
02:02:13,020 --> 02:02:20,970
Maybe not RNG. Come on

898
02:02:23,279 --> 02:02:30,720
He just needs to wake up and then we can get the hell out of here minus 35

899
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:32,800
There's no way I can speed that up at all

900
02:02:43,869 --> 02:02:55,130
Food. Oh free food. Come on

901
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:29,689
Somebody's dead too. Come on kill the kill them and move on put out the where are they they're coming this way, aren't they?

902
02:03:32,189 --> 02:03:42,119
They're right there. I could kill these three easy. No, I don't have I can't even use my weapon. They're all killing each other

903
02:03:42,119 --> 02:03:43,399
This is perfect

904
02:03:43,399 --> 02:03:54,039
Let me sneak over there because they get on the road and I got free supplies right here

905
02:03:55,789 --> 02:03:58,109
Hold on. Let me I gotta dump this stuff over here

906
02:03:58,649 --> 02:04:05,470
Temporarily, I got a bunch of shit. I'm gonna just put it down right here, right?

907
02:04:05,550 --> 02:04:09,310
Make sure nobody comes over here because this probably supplies and food

908
02:04:13,390 --> 02:04:36,479
Okay, i'm gonna go for it. I'm gonna save it right here. There they are. All right, come on get up there

909
02:04:40,829 --> 02:04:52,090
We have a couple of bodies. Yep. Come on get over there body number one

02:04:57,680 --> 02:04:59,680
You got nothing important

911
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
With the wolves the body too right here

912
02:05:04,170 --> 02:05:09,500
Nothing worth taking nothing. Where are those wolves?

913
02:05:11,340 --> 02:05:20,430
Right here. Come on. Really?

914
02:05:20,510 --> 02:05:31,159

All right, go bandits are these bandits are these holy men holy men? Okay, we're good

916
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:45,630
What about some more supplies back? We should be fine after this

917
02:05:53,420 --> 02:06:06,670
Get another camp built campfire. All right, get the food up there. It should be already doing it, right?

918
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,020
All right

919
02:06:17,020 --> 02:06:20,810
Are we good? I don't see anybody should be fine

920
02:06:21,630 --> 02:06:23,630
What is all this? Oh, that's my okay

921
02:06:23,949 --> 02:06:28,239
Well, I need to it's fine food's more important right now

922
02:06:37,630 --> 02:06:40,430
They can still eat right if they're unconscious

923
02:06:41,069 --> 02:06:50,880
Or they have to wait till they get up

924
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:53,279
These pelts are worth. Okay, what's worth more money?

925
02:06:54,239 --> 02:06:58,300
the pelts or the

926
02:06:58,300 --> 02:07:00,750
Let's see

927
02:07:00,750 --> 02:07:02,750
We're good. Save it again

928
02:07:04,909 --> 02:07:08,109
How do you fix your arm? I need a splint and I already used it

929
02:07:08,750 --> 02:07:10,590
I don't think I have any more

930
02:07:10,590 --> 02:07:14,489
I do put it on the ground here

931
02:07:14,810 --> 02:07:25,920
Didn't I already do this?

932
02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:27,920
All right, so that leaves me with

933
02:07:29,020 --> 02:07:33,000
240

934
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,560
Yeah, these are 175. So that's okay. I'm all right with that

935
02:07:36,359 --> 02:07:38,359
these sell for

936
02:07:38,520 --> 02:07:40,600
Not very much each. I need to free up some space

937
02:07:41,479 --> 02:07:43,579
I'd rather have two more

938
02:07:43,579 --> 02:07:45,020
coppers

939
02:07:45,020 --> 02:07:48,859
Let's open up your bag

940
02:07:48,859 --> 02:07:52,890
We need to trade with you

941
02:07:52,890 --> 02:07:59,159
Let's put these in here

942
02:07:59,159 --> 02:08:05,310
All right

943
02:08:05,310 --> 02:08:07,310
get these on

944
02:08:07,869 --> 02:08:10,800
you

945
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:12,800
Rearrange this I can take some more

946
02:08:19,819 --> 02:08:21,500
And that's good

947
02:08:21,500 --> 02:08:24,140
All right. Now you just have to recover and we have to get the hell out of here

948
02:08:24,699 --> 02:08:32,520
You've been healed

949
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:34,520
All right minus 28

950
02:08:34,760 --> 02:08:35,720
Save it

951
02:08:35,720 --> 02:08:41,439
Where are you going make a plan now? That's true. Okay

952
02:08:42,319 --> 02:08:47,760
I mean, I already had a plan. I was gonna go to stack. It's right there. It's right here

953
02:08:50,359 --> 02:08:52,359
Maybe I should just run him to stack

954
02:08:52,520 --> 02:08:55,069
Or run the dog to stack and then he can get up later

955
02:08:57,289 --> 02:09:02,970
That might be worth doing

956
02:09:02,970 --> 02:09:04,970
Dog is not going to get up for a long time

957
02:09:05,130 --> 02:09:08,170
Neither will you

958
02:09:08,170 --> 02:09:09,609
splint the dog

959
02:09:09,609 --> 02:09:12,939
Uh, did I already did I thought

960
02:09:13,260 --> 02:09:15,949
I'm gonna have a splint right here. I have first aid here

961
02:09:17,949 --> 02:09:18,989
splint

962
02:09:18,989 --> 02:09:20,510
No, I can't

963
02:09:20,510 --> 02:09:24,649
Can't splint myself either

964
02:09:24,649 --> 02:09:26,649
I mean, I don't know how far away that is though

965
02:09:26,970 --> 02:09:34,960
I wonder if that's a good idea. Just you know, I think that's what i'm gonna do

966
02:09:35,680 --> 02:09:38,250
pick up the dog

967
02:09:38,250 --> 02:09:40,569
Get to stack put dog somewhere safe

968
02:09:42,810 --> 02:09:45,609
And then when he gets up eventually here block to stack

969
02:09:50,520 --> 02:09:52,920
That's the plan. Let's hope nothing goes wrong

970
02:09:55,600 --> 02:09:57,609
stack

971
02:09:57,609 --> 02:10:01,449
Good luck canned roth

972
02:10:01,449 --> 02:10:03,930
Let's go. I gotta move. I can't just sit out here

973
02:10:04,569 --> 02:10:07,899
The sacrifice needs to be made

974
02:10:07,899 --> 02:10:12,800
I've got the material

975
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:15,680
I need the backpack. Fuck

976
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:17,770
Give me the backpack

977
02:10:17,770 --> 02:10:19,770
Just in case something terrible happens to you

978
02:10:27,479 --> 02:10:29,739
backpack

979
02:10:29,739 --> 02:10:32,039
All right

980
02:10:32,039 --> 02:10:35,500
Get on there. Let's see. We got

981
02:10:35,979 --> 02:10:39,260
We got all these materials. All right. Good luck. See you later

982
02:10:39,899 --> 02:10:44,199
let's head

983
02:10:44,199 --> 02:10:46,520
to

984
02:10:46,520 --> 02:10:52,699
Stack it's right here. Hopefully this is like not a hostile town or something. That would be a horrible pain in the ass

985
02:10:53,949 --> 02:10:55,949
Good luck. See you soon. Take care of yourself

986
02:10:56,670 --> 02:10:58,670
I hope you're okay in like

987
02:10:58,810 --> 02:11:00,430
15 minutes

988
02:11:00,430 --> 02:11:10,399
Everybody on the road

989
02:11:10,399 --> 02:11:15,340
I think we're safe the dog. I think the dog. No, the dog is not dead. The dog is recovering

990
02:11:16,720 --> 02:11:19,960
Everybody's fine

991
02:11:19,960 --> 02:11:21,960
Sneaking. Yes. I'm sneaking because it gives you points

992
02:11:22,600 --> 02:11:24,600
Take a look

993
02:11:24,600 --> 02:11:27,399
stealth stealth is increasing because i'm sneaking

994
02:11:31,390 --> 02:11:33,239
Or it was

995
02:11:33,239 --> 02:11:34,760
Is it not anymore?

996
02:11:34,760 --> 02:11:40,859
What it was doing it before?

997
02:11:40,859 --> 02:11:46,170
It only increases when you're near people

998
02:11:52,170 --> 02:11:56,590
Well, never mind

999
02:12:05,229 --> 02:12:07,229
Okay, i'm almost there. All right. How you doing over here

1000

1001
02:12:12,920 --> 02:12:15,920
Who is this?

1002
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:20,359
What did you?

1003
02:12:20,359 --> 02:12:31,600
He still has everything. He's fine. What did he take? He didn't take anything. I still have all the material. What did he even take?

1004
02:12:38,760 --> 02:12:43,850
Food did I even have any food? He took the food

1005
02:12:48,619 --> 02:13:04,399
Where am I? All right. Hold on. I should have put out the fire. Just get up there. I'll make you still let you good

1006
02:13:04,960 --> 02:13:31,050

free food, um

1008
02:13:39,979 --> 02:13:41,979
Why can't I stack it in my inventory?

1009
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:47,560
Damn it. Are these they'll stay here, right?

1010
02:13:52,399 --> 02:13:59,899
They'll stay i'm gonna go right to a shop. You're still okay 917. No bandits or anything

1011
02:14:03,899 --> 02:14:09,899
What love and devotion brother your time for a moment? I don't have time for this

1012
02:14:18,640 --> 02:14:24,720
Divine blessings brother darkness tries to make its way to our hollow lands only through vigilance can be defeated. I need to check your belongings

1013
02:14:25,680 --> 02:14:38,170
Holy brother, may I

1014
02:14:38,170 --> 02:14:44,189

Take the book, huh? Take the book take the book bring the book take the book get the book

1016
02:14:50,189 --> 02:15:04,779
You need the book. I stole this book and now they're gonna know you need it not to get kicked out. It's stolen

1017
02:15:08,970 --> 02:15:48,090
I stole all this stuff. I understand good. Let's see. Ah the holy flame

1018
02:15:48,250 --> 02:15:54,489
Well, just a quick check brother looks clean. I was supposed to have the book

1019
02:16:26,909 --> 02:16:28,029
Uh

1020
02:16:28,029 --> 02:16:30,029
Get me into it. I need a saloon

1021
02:16:30,670 --> 02:16:33,000
stat

1022
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
Right over here. Come on. Just go to the bathroom

1023
02:16:35,319 --> 02:16:37,319
Quickly get over here sell this stuff

1024
02:16:38,440 --> 02:16:40,440
We demand an apology

1025
02:16:42,879 --> 02:16:45,760
All right. Look do I have to say i'm sorry?

1026
02:16:46,799 --> 02:16:47,680
when

1027
02:16:47,680 --> 02:16:50,319
There's been like eight out of ten times

1028
02:16:51,549 --> 02:16:53,950
You guys made me do something that I wasn't supposed to do

1029
02:16:54,750 --> 02:16:56,750
It's like the boy who cried wolf

1030
02:16:56,989 --> 02:17:03,290
Let's see your wares

1031
02:17:03,290 --> 02:17:04,250
sell

1032
02:17:04,250 --> 02:17:18,809
Look at that money

1033
02:17:18,809 --> 02:17:20,809
Not not even half of it 6500 bucks

1034
02:17:25,639 --> 02:17:29,079
We accept apologies in the form of doom osts

1035
02:17:30,250 --> 02:17:33,370
Well wouldn't oh wouldn't you wouldn't you? Yes, you would

1036
02:17:39,129 --> 02:17:41,770
And I don't want this weapon, okay

1037
02:17:46,879 --> 02:17:48,879
So that is 6700

1038
02:17:49,600 --> 02:17:51,600
How are we doing over here?

1039
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:54,520
Minus 15

1040
02:17:54,520 --> 02:17:57,639
I might have to come out and get him just put the dog down somewhere to hang out

1041
02:18:00,090 --> 02:18:02,090
The stream that cried book

1042
02:18:03,790 --> 02:18:05,870
Yeah, it's he's I gotta come out and get him

1043
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:11,069
I have to

1044
02:18:11,069 --> 02:18:15,239
Now i'm gonna put the dog down

1045
02:18:15,239 --> 02:18:17,239
Thanks for the money. See you later

1046
02:18:19,629 --> 02:18:21,629
Dog will just hang out over here somewhere

1047
02:18:21,950 --> 02:18:26,520
Put down dog

1048
02:18:26,520 --> 02:18:29,799
Dog is just recovering dog doesn't have any items or anything. So

1049
02:18:30,920 --> 02:18:35,559
And i'm bringing it all the way back here to go. I can run now. I actually can sprint

1050
02:18:35,879 --> 02:18:40,059
So let's save it

1051
02:18:40,059 --> 02:18:44,780
And get here turn it on. I need to go pick you up because yeah, I don't think you're gonna get up in time

1052
02:18:46,649 --> 02:18:49,159
It's riskier

1053
02:18:49,159 --> 02:18:50,520
Who's on this road?

1054
02:18:50,520 --> 02:18:56,729
Probably servants. That's fine

1055
02:19:04,030 --> 02:19:07,729
What a disaster. I haven't done anything. We put on osts

1056
02:19:09,790 --> 02:19:11,790
And then I got killed three times

1057
02:19:13,979 --> 02:19:15,979
All right, make sure there's nothing on the ground here

1058
02:19:16,700 --> 02:19:18,540
There is some animal teeth

1059
02:19:18,540 --> 02:19:25,209
Might as well just get it

1060
02:19:25,209 --> 02:19:27,819
All right back it up

1061
02:19:27,819 --> 02:19:30,350
Nothing else on the ground

1062
02:19:30,350 --> 02:19:31,389
Let's go

1063
02:19:31,389 --> 02:19:41,100
the front door

1064
02:19:41,100 --> 02:19:42,840
Let's go

1065
02:19:42,840 --> 02:19:50,079
out

1066
02:19:50,079 --> 02:19:52,079
And is that is it?

1067
02:19:52,239 --> 02:19:54,540
these raiders

1068
02:19:54,540 --> 02:19:57,229
pack beast

1069
02:19:57,229 --> 02:19:58,989
um, i'm

1070
02:19:58,989 --> 02:20:03,950
Am I gonna cross the bed? There's something out. Wait, we got a potential we got a loot situation coming up here. I think

1071
02:20:04,989 --> 02:20:06,989
Because we got a fight brewing

1072
02:20:07,229 --> 02:20:09,159
between some

1073
02:20:09,159 --> 02:20:11,239
The holy servants and are they raiding this town or something?

1074
02:20:18,920 --> 02:20:39,420
Nomad trying to be running over to them. Something's gonna break out here

1075
02:20:40,139 --> 02:20:42,139
Are these competing factions?

1076
02:20:42,700 --> 02:20:51,979
No, they're going right to the front door

1077
02:20:53,690 --> 02:20:57,610
The dogs are just a lot like the weird animal pigs that just can go in. Okay

1078
02:21:05,690 --> 02:21:07,690
Wait, what is going on over here?

1079
02:21:08,409 --> 02:21:13,290
Well, that was quite the distraction free meat

1080
02:21:14,010 --> 02:21:17,930
I thought they were coming to me

1081
02:21:17,930 --> 02:21:21,920
They were not coming to me

1082
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:24,219
Well, I gotta get this meat

1083
02:21:24,219 --> 02:21:31,690
Give me give me give me

1084
02:21:31,690 --> 02:21:35,530
They might they already take it. No, they didn't

1085
02:21:35,850 --> 02:21:40,120
Let's go

1086
02:21:40,120 --> 02:21:42,600
And meat on these guys too. Probably this would be good

1087
02:21:44,030 --> 02:21:45,149
Oh, yeah

1088
02:21:45,149 --> 02:21:49,049
Can't believe they're not taking this this up. So valuable

1089
02:21:49,610 --> 02:21:54,200
That's even more money

1090
02:21:54,200 --> 02:21:58,120
Cool. Let's meet up with the dog and go from here

1091
02:21:58,760 --> 02:22:11,879
Okay, I gotta put you down

1092
02:22:15,159 --> 02:22:17,159

a lot of stuff

1095
02:22:26,239 --> 02:22:28,239
Nobody will steal these if I leave it on them, right?

1096
02:22:28,879 --> 02:22:30,000
it might

1097
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:37,920
For the first time i'm gonna have more than 10 grand. I think

1098
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:49,420

Buy a second dog and breed dogs

1103
02:23:12,729 --> 02:23:22,750
Can you do that?

1104
02:23:22,750 --> 02:23:24,909
Ninety eight seventy two. That's too bad

1105
02:23:25,629 --> 02:23:29,399

1106
02:23:29,399 --> 02:23:32,600
An idea two dogs

1107
02:23:32,600 --> 02:23:36,680
That is an idea

1108
02:23:36,680 --> 02:23:37,719
uh

1109
02:23:37,719 --> 02:23:40,600
I don't think it's necessary actually because he you're almost up

1110
02:23:41,899 --> 02:23:45,370
Yeah, they're they're gonna be fine another minute or two

1111

1115
02:24:02,239 --> 02:24:03,440

But i'll be right back. I'm gonna take this see you in a minute

1120
02:26:23,559 --> 02:26:38,860
Okay. So yeah, let's now we're guessing germa's height in inches at 69

1121
02:26:39,340 --> 02:26:45,319
I don't mean that as a funny look at how funny that was joke. That's just how it's just how many inches tall

1122
02:26:48,059 --> 02:26:51,870
Okay

1123
02:26:51,870 --> 02:27:04,030
Back to it. What time do you need? Not very much for both of you

1124
02:27:04,829 --> 02:27:07,129
I'm gonna take this opportunity to go buy

1125
02:27:08,159 --> 02:27:10,319

These don't do very much

1128
02:27:14,649 --> 02:27:18,620
The nutrition is really not good

1129
02:27:18,620 --> 02:27:21,040

Should I get gear should I actually have them put on real equipment?

1134
02:27:40,670 --> 02:27:42,829
Should I get more first aid?

1135
02:27:48,430 --> 02:27:50,430

There's an inn the bar

1154
02:29:25,739 --> 02:29:31,290

02:30:56,829 --> 02:30:59,149
That's too much right 112 percent

1173
02:31:08,620 --> 02:31:10,700
Travel stores leave this other side of town quality

1174
02:31:12,649 --> 02:31:16,250
Five out of a hundred. Why are you these this those are so bad

1175
02:31:24,940 --> 02:31:30,459
Let me just see if there's any others

1176
02:31:30,459 --> 02:31:32,059
other side of town

1177
02:31:32,059 --> 02:31:40,299
so like over here

1178
02:31:40,299 --> 02:31:41,579

1179
02:31:41,579 --> 02:31:43,579

Why would I ban you what are you talking about?

1184
02:32:09,420 --> 02:32:12,059
All right, this is important. I need to make sure I get this right

1185
02:32:12,860 --> 02:32:15,100
Because these are expensive so

1186
02:32:16,559 --> 02:32:19,049
large backpack

1187
02:32:19,049 --> 02:32:22,409
This backpack is huge. Don't even think about fighting with this on your back

1188
02:32:22,889 --> 02:32:24,889
The thing weighs a ton just when it's empty

1189
02:32:25,049 --> 02:32:28,489
Do you seriously think you can fill it full of iron or something and be able to lift it?

1190
02:32:28,729 --> 02:32:32,170
Let alone carry it across the desert go get a smaller one

1191
02:32:36,989 --> 02:32:38,989
traders wooden backpack

1192
02:32:39,069 --> 02:32:42,250
A wooden backpack with a built-in sunshade. It's the height

1193
02:32:42,809 --> 02:32:44,809
Of luxury for the traveling trader

1194
02:32:45,370 --> 02:32:55,879
traders backpacks stack items

1195
02:32:56,520 --> 02:33:02,479
Okay, so I should get three of these how much are they 400?

1196
02:33:02,559 --> 02:33:06,559
Mmm, she's a dog enough. Can the dog have a backpack? Can the dog have a small backpack?

1197
02:33:13,309 --> 02:33:18,879
Look at this reduction. They all only one person should have a backpack

1198
02:33:24,649 --> 02:33:26,649
Get rid of the dog already

1199
02:33:26,969 --> 02:33:40,219
This one's 400 i'm gonna buy it. I got this one

1200
02:33:40,940 --> 02:33:43,500
Let's see. I'm gonna go like this

1201
02:33:53,930 --> 02:33:57,530
You can just drop a backpack before every fight that kind of scares the shit out of me though

1202
02:33:58,250 --> 02:34:03,500
Okay, so that's now

1203
02:34:07,879 --> 02:34:09,879
That's a smaller backpack

1204
02:34:11,440 --> 02:34:13,440
How much what's a full stack?

1205
02:34:13,440 --> 02:34:19,770
What is it 10 20 for a full stack?

1206
02:34:28,389 --> 02:34:29,850
64

1207
02:34:29,850 --> 02:34:36,440
What if I do backpack inside the backpack now that i'm not doing diablo 2 for roger cube bullshit

1208
02:34:37,159 --> 02:34:41,690
I could sell this

1209
02:34:41,690 --> 02:34:48,350
No, that's all right for now. No, what about these boots?

1210
02:34:50,629 --> 02:34:52,440
drifters boots

1211
02:34:52,440 --> 02:34:54,600
Blunt resistance cut resistance. These are pretty good

1212
02:34:55,399 --> 02:35:00,520
I'm only 149

1213
02:35:00,520 --> 02:35:03,399
Athletics effect. Let's see

1214
02:35:03,399 --> 02:35:06,440
coverage right leg left leg stealth effect is worse

1215
02:35:07,319 --> 02:35:16,670
athletic effect

1216
02:35:16,670 --> 02:35:18,270
so the sandals

1217
02:35:18,270 --> 02:35:21,129
Give you combat speed and run speed

1218
02:35:21,770 --> 02:35:22,969
whereas

1219
02:35:22,969 --> 02:35:25,049
These are actual protection

1220
02:35:25,690 --> 02:35:32,920
I could keep both of them. Just how many pairs do I want?

1221
02:35:34,040 --> 02:35:36,040
So these are plated long boots

1222
02:35:36,440 --> 02:35:38,520
These are these are less these are worth less. Okay

1223
02:35:39,639 --> 02:35:42,440
so harpoon resistance, they're a little worse, but

1224
02:35:43,159 --> 02:35:46,879
Oh, it's just a high grade

1225
02:35:47,040 --> 02:35:49,040
Standard grade high grade. I get it

1226
02:35:52,559 --> 02:35:54,270

Save money for a house. Yeah

1228
02:35:56,270 --> 02:35:59,500
That's probably I need food and shit too and I don't want to go broke. So

1229
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:07,760
What and what is this thing?

1230
02:36:09,799 --> 02:36:11,799

Yeah, but I just in case something happens

1441
02:59:53,959 --> 02:59:59,979
You know, let's just say

1442
02:59:59,979 --> 03:00:01,979
I don't this is not a person. They're not gonna care

03:00:02,459 --> 03:00:06,350
All right. Here we go. Let's take a look

1444
03:00:06,969 --> 03:00:08,409

03:00:08,409 --> 03:00:16,299
This is one for free

1446
03:00:16,299 --> 03:00:18,219

03:00:30,680 --> 03:00:32,680
I don't think I thought the guy was upstairs

1450
03:00:34,040 --> 03:00:37,420
I thought he was upstairs. I thought the guy was sleeping upstairs

1451
03:00:38,139 --> 03:00:51,000
whatever

1452
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:53,000
Go in there and kill him. Why would I do that?

03:02:43,600 --> 03:02:46,700
Okay, the whole purpose was to come over here and get this stuff. So

1463
03:02:47,420 --> 03:02:51,370
I don't need to sneak anymore

1464
03:02:51,370 --> 03:02:54,280
Hey, look at that save

03:02:54,280 --> 03:02:56,280
Steel bars. I it's I can't

1466
03:02:56,760 --> 03:03:04,090
When does the store open?

1467
03:03:04,090 --> 03:03:07,049

03:03:07,049 --> 03:03:08,409

1469
03:03:08,409 --> 03:03:19,399

1470
03:03:19,399 --> 03:03:21,399
You can't steal the door 6 a.m. Hey

1471
03:03:22,700 --> 03:03:25,899
I have some things i'd like to buy my favorite customer. That's me

1472
03:03:27,020 --> 03:03:29,389
How are you?

1473
03:03:29,389 --> 03:03:31,069
building materials

1474
03:03:31,069 --> 03:03:33,069
One two, and I also need

1475
03:03:34,190 --> 03:03:35,229
oh

1476
03:03:35,229 --> 03:03:37,850
sleeping bags

1477
03:03:37,850 --> 03:03:39,209
You don't have them

1478
03:03:39,209 --> 03:03:48,729
I think I have to go to the other part of town, but that's fine. Thank you for that

1479
03:03:49,530 --> 03:03:51,530
At least I can build the research bench

1480
03:03:51,770 --> 03:04:04,059
How's everybody doing over here? So let's get some of you guys to work

1481
03:04:09,899 --> 03:04:14,010
No, get up there

1482
03:04:14,010 --> 03:04:16,090
And then you go get the sleeping bags

1483
03:04:16,729 --> 03:04:18,329
How long is that gonna take?

1484
03:04:18,329 --> 03:04:19,690
very long

1485
03:04:19,690 --> 03:04:24,360
Where's the dog? Oh in my arm still. Okay. All right

1486
03:04:24,360 --> 03:04:25,719
frogmasco

1487
03:04:25,719 --> 03:04:26,920
to the

1488
03:04:26,920 --> 03:04:29,840
adventurer's store

1489
03:04:29,840 --> 03:04:31,840
Which is down here

1490
03:04:31,840 --> 03:04:45,129
Welcome back

1491
03:04:45,129 --> 03:04:47,129
Building small research bench is complete

1492
03:04:47,770 --> 03:04:50,270
Let's get why do they always do this?

1493
03:04:51,500 --> 03:04:56,399
sleeping bags

1494
03:04:56,399 --> 03:04:57,280
uh

1495
03:04:57,280 --> 03:05:10,459
sleeping bags

1496
03:05:10,459 --> 03:05:13,399
I don't see any sleeping bags

1497
03:05:13,399 --> 03:05:15,399
You're too short to talk over the counter

1498
03:05:17,079 --> 03:05:19,079
I mean that that makes sense

1499
03:05:24,219 --> 03:05:26,219
Well, you don't have any

1500
03:05:26,299 --> 03:05:34,649
All right, how to research tech to learn new tech you can buy blueprints from merchants or you can research the tech yourself

1501
03:05:35,450 --> 03:05:37,450
The research you must have a scientist

1502
03:05:37,850 --> 03:05:43,690
Assigned to your research bench select a squad member hold right click on your research bench and select a use machine

1503
03:05:44,809 --> 03:05:48,969
Research people depend on your assigned scientist science skill stat

1504
03:05:50,590 --> 03:05:52,590
That is a tongue twister

1505
03:05:52,840 --> 03:05:57,319
assigned scientist science skill stat assigned scientist science skill stat

1506
03:05:59,290 --> 03:06:02,250
Next you need to select tech to research like tech from the panel

1507
03:06:02,649 --> 03:06:06,170
Select any tech you want to research by left clicking it. You can queue up as many as you want

1508
03:06:07,899 --> 03:06:11,899
So somebody kind of has to stay back here and do that. The question is who?

1509
03:06:14,159 --> 03:06:15,520
i'm gonna say

1510
03:06:15,520 --> 03:06:16,959
can't rock

1511
03:06:16,959 --> 03:06:19,639
My original character is terrible

1512
03:06:20,809 --> 03:06:22,649
The dog can't do it

1513
03:06:22,649 --> 03:06:27,899
The dog cannot be a scientist

1514
03:06:28,219 --> 03:06:29,819
I'm, sorry guys

1515
03:06:29,819 --> 03:06:41,629
Can the dog be a scientist?

1516
03:06:41,629 --> 03:06:43,629
Dog cannot be scientist

1517
03:06:43,959 --> 03:06:45,959
I can be a scientist

1518
03:06:48,280 --> 03:06:50,280
Hold on. Let me look at the stats here

1519
03:06:52,170 --> 03:06:53,450
so we got

1520
03:06:53,450 --> 03:06:56,780
chattam-mattam

1521
03:06:56,780 --> 03:06:59,370

1522
03:06:59,370 --> 03:07:04,139

1523
03:07:06,760 --> 03:07:08,760

03:07:11,559 --> 03:07:13,479
labor medic, uh

1525
03:07:13,479 --> 03:07:15,159
can roth is

1526
03:07:15,159 --> 03:07:18,120
huge labor athletics huge and

1527
03:07:20,639 --> 03:07:23,680
I think he just I think can roth is just gonna have to be the

1528
03:07:24,940 --> 03:07:27,500
The one that does all the stuff that has nothing to do with fighting

1529
03:07:31,159 --> 03:07:34,590
strength 28

1530
03:07:34,590 --> 03:07:37,680

1531
03:07:37,680 --> 03:07:39,200
Or I don't know

1532
03:07:39,200 --> 03:07:43,799
You should mine. I need another character

1533
03:07:49,309 --> 03:07:53,149
I need another character. I need to go buy another character to be a scientist

1534
03:07:56,600 --> 03:07:58,600
All right. I'm gonna go buy a scientist

1535
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:09,680
I'll be back

1536
03:08:09,680 --> 03:08:12,219
Everybody hang out

I gotta find another person to be in the squad

1538
03:08:15,020 --> 03:08:24,700
Let's go with the bar. Let's go this one start at the end

1539
03:08:28,479 --> 03:08:30,879
If you're searching i'm a bit of a scientist myself

1540
03:08:31,600 --> 03:08:34,799
That's all right, though. I mean

1541
03:08:35,200 --> 03:08:42,680

1542
03:08:42,680 --> 03:08:45,500

1543
03:08:45,500 --> 03:08:51,979

1581
03:11:17,870 --> 03:11:30,540
And it's can't be the dog

1582
03:11:30,620 --> 03:11:32,620

storage box or storage box

1595
03:12:35,579 --> 03:12:41,100
Things will go a lot smoother if we organize an efficient method to store and distribute our raw material. Otherwise things are going to get jammed up

1596
03:12:42,860 --> 03:12:45,659
storage or storage steel bars steel iron plates copper

1597
03:12:49,739 --> 03:12:51,260
Books are next door

1598
03:12:51,260 --> 03:13:01,530
There's so much going on here

1599
03:13:01,530 --> 03:13:02,889
You sell books

1600
03:13:02,889 --> 03:13:09,049
What you got?

1601
03:13:09,049 --> 03:13:12,600
Okay book a book from the university of

Steal it

1606
03:13:35,440 --> 03:13:48,799
There's nothing here to take

1607
03:13:48,799 --> 03:13:54,639
Stealing is bad. I'm just gonna buy the books. How many don't need three two. I need the training dummy three books

1608
03:13:55,440 --> 03:13:56,959
Was it two or three?

1613
03:14:32,239 --> 03:14:33,440
So that's

1614
03:14:33,440 --> 03:14:37,040
I need five

1615
03:14:37,040 --> 03:14:38,700
All right

That's all i'm gonna do right now so I can at least I can do lockpicking practice

1617
03:14:43,500 --> 03:14:50,430
Let's get done frog's gonna stay back his arm is all messed up

1618
03:14:53,870 --> 03:14:56,190
so use

1619
03:14:56,190 --> 03:14:58,379
so research

1620
03:14:58,379 --> 03:15:01,040
training

1621
03:15:01,040 --> 03:15:30,159
what

1622
03:15:30,239 --> 03:15:38,920
Okay, simple training dummies damn rookies are useless keep getting beat up because they can't hit anything a basic training

1623
03:15:38,920 --> 03:15:41,399
dummy would let them train their attack skills up to about level five

1624
03:15:44,909 --> 03:15:46,639
and then

1625
03:15:46,639 --> 03:15:50,879
Learning to pick locks is hard to get started. It's too late to learn once you're locked in a cage training

1626
03:15:50,879 --> 03:15:52,879
Is needed to get you put in the ladder

1627
03:15:52,959 --> 03:15:53,920
Okay

1628
03:15:53,920 --> 03:15:56,139
Get it

1629
03:15:56,139 --> 03:16:06,969
three hours lock picking three hours like real time or in game time

1630
03:16:07,450 --> 03:16:15,209
Who's working on this?

1631
03:16:15,209 --> 03:16:17,209
Am I working on this?

1632
03:16:17,450 --> 03:16:21,879
Engineering right

1633
03:16:21,879 --> 03:16:23,959
Science, okay

1634
03:16:23,959 --> 03:16:37,260
He's got it. So where can I put the training dummy?

1635
03:16:37,819 --> 03:16:40,620
I want privacy

1636
03:16:40,620 --> 03:16:46,139
So we've got show the research. All right, let's speed it up

1637
03:16:47,020 --> 03:16:51,690
Wait ever people can we can all do it at the same time, right?

1638
03:16:55,920 --> 03:16:58,969
use

1639
03:16:58,969 --> 03:17:00,989
use

1640
03:17:00,989 --> 03:17:03,229
No

1641
03:17:03,229 --> 03:17:05,229
No, only one person can be here. Okay

1642
03:17:06,680 --> 03:17:08,440
Only one at each bench

1643
03:17:08,440 --> 03:17:11,069
So we do just kind of have to sit here

1644
03:17:11,469 --> 03:17:14,840
sit here

1645
03:17:14,840 --> 03:17:17,559
There's a huge fight going on and i'm not seeing it

1646
03:17:18,360 --> 03:17:25,520
where

1647
03:17:25,520 --> 03:17:48,590
Huge fight. There's nobody out here. Like I didn't get baited. Did I?

1648
03:17:49,229 --> 03:17:57,200
Almost done. There's no dog bed. Well, that's all right

1649
03:17:57,760 --> 03:18:06,090
Who's training science?

1650
03:18:06,090 --> 03:18:08,569
Uh, it is frog musk is the one that's doing it

1651
03:18:09,270 --> 03:18:13,579
Specifically because frog musk is currently very injured

1652
03:18:14,299 --> 03:18:16,540
And it's gonna take a while for them to heal

1653
03:18:19,319 --> 03:18:21,760
All right, we got a training dummy

1654
03:18:21,760 --> 03:18:23,760
Well, hey, why are you doing that?

1655
03:18:23,760 --> 03:18:26,719
Not because I moved him

1656
03:18:26,719 --> 03:18:29,520
So now build let's just see what happens here build

1657
03:18:31,549 --> 03:18:33,530
training dummy

1658
03:18:33,530 --> 03:18:37,049
Need four iron plates. Shit. What if I put them outside?

1659
03:18:37,930 --> 03:18:41,370
Oh, man, this is such a small shack. I can't put them anywhere

1660
03:18:44,030 --> 03:18:45,870
Where am I gonna put this?

1661
03:18:45,870 --> 03:18:50,090
It's gonna have to go right next to the bed

1662
03:18:56,110 --> 03:18:58,430
Make a second floor. I can't afford that

1663
03:19:02,040 --> 03:19:04,040
So I need four iron plates

1664
03:19:08,110 --> 03:19:11,229
Now all of you leave it alone frog musk is the one that's going to be using it

1665
03:19:18,840 --> 03:19:22,200
The rest of you

1666
03:19:22,200 --> 03:19:28,479
Are gonna have to go on a mission here

1667
03:19:28,479 --> 03:19:31,760
There's the auto save

1668
03:19:31,760 --> 03:19:33,760
These buildings are unexpandable. Okay

1669
03:19:36,319 --> 03:19:37,920
so I have this

1670
03:19:37,920 --> 03:19:42,750

1671
03:19:42,750 --> 03:19:44,190
I need

1672
03:19:44,190 --> 03:19:47,260
I need to think of where the hell I want to go from here

1673
03:19:49,500 --> 03:19:52,620
Because I have I need food. So we're gonna stock up on some food

1674
03:19:55,500 --> 03:19:59,319

1677
03:20:07,149 --> 03:20:14,360

Why does this restaurant have four stars on yelp? This place is awful

03:25:22,110 --> 03:25:26,670
They bring out the food you cut into it. You eat the first piece of steak. Oh boy. Oh

1737
03:25:28,700 --> 03:25:31,069
Who comes here?

Can I stack these? Yes, I can

1789
03:32:03,819 --> 03:32:10,399
That's gonna be this. Hey, this is what we're doing. Hey

Well, this they will stack in here, right?

1795
03:32:31,000 --> 03:32:43,870
What's wrong with them? You're okay

1796
03:32:48,159 --> 03:32:55,399
Why did you stop doing this? He has no food

1797
03:32:59,280 --> 03:33:02,639
I locked him in the house and said work on it

1798
03:33:03,930 --> 03:33:05,930
I took his clothes on his food

1799
03:33:06,329 --> 03:33:08,329
He's standing in the dark

1800
03:33:17,739 --> 03:33:28,399
Oh, yeah, yeah, he'll be all right. I'll just go buy him a snack right now hungry

1801
03:33:33,899 --> 03:33:35,899
Standing naked in an empty room

1802
03:33:36,459 --> 03:33:39,389
Work on it

1803
03:33:39,389 --> 03:33:43,360

03:33:54,540 --> 03:33:57,500
So I can buy like one piece of beef jerky and that's it

1808
03:33:58,059 --> 03:34:04,639
Need to go to a bar that sells it

1809
03:34:04,719 --> 03:34:06,909

All right. There's a can of cooked vegetables over here

1814
03:34:35,079 --> 03:34:37,079
It's very possible that I can sneak

1815
03:34:38,540 --> 03:34:40,540
And get the can of cooked vegetables

1816
03:34:41,260 --> 03:34:42,620
And just eat it

1817
03:34:42,620 --> 03:35:06,760

All right. So you got food you got some bread you got some grog and cooked vegetables. You should be fine for a while

1825
03:36:30,079 --> 03:36:31,280
Back to work

03:36:31,280 --> 03:36:35,209
Lock picking training good. Let's check on this

03:36:35,930 --> 03:36:39,690
Look at that. What does it say?

1828
03:36:39,690 --> 03:36:41,690
Your your machine is full

1829
03:36:41,770 --> 03:36:44,909
Your machine is full machines are buildings

1830
03:36:45,309 --> 03:36:48,110
Only have a maximum of materials I can hold after they produce them

1831
03:36:48,909 --> 03:36:51,790
You won't be able to produce. Oh, this is the this is technically a machine

1832
03:36:52,829 --> 03:37:03,440
Okay

1833
03:37:03,440 --> 03:37:09,370
Back to it. So five can be in there before I have to take it out

1834
03:37:15,520 --> 03:37:17,770
Close the door

I have so much room. Um, this is gonna be a lot. I'm gonna have probably twenty thousand or thirty thousand dollars

1838
03:37:48,559 --> 03:38:01,069
That's very possible

1839
03:38:01,069 --> 03:38:04,670
Uh, I can I I they're just gonna have to sit here all day forever

1840
03:38:07,799 --> 03:38:11,799

1841
03:38:12,520 --> 03:38:17,049
All right. What else can we do?

1842
03:38:17,049 --> 03:38:18,879

gear storage

1846
03:38:27,040 --> 03:38:29,040
It doesn't require anything

1847
03:38:29,879 --> 03:38:31,020
Do it

1848
03:38:31,020 --> 03:38:33,659
item storage

1849
03:38:33,659 --> 03:38:38,540
Public sales it would be it would save us a lot of running around to sell goods if we could just get the customers to come to us

1850
03:38:41,600 --> 03:38:46,319
Crafting defense electric. Okay storage boxes. This is no requirement

1851
03:38:47,899 --> 03:38:50,860

Going to dog adventure

1857
03:39:23,370 --> 03:39:29,340
All right, the dog is going to explore the universe a little here

1858
03:39:46,110 --> 03:39:50,090
First I want to save it and then we're going to get a dog song

1859
03:39:50,649 --> 03:40:09,100
We'll get some dog music. I got just the thing

1903
03:50:36,360 --> 03:50:41,389
Best overall use of cardboard I would say

1904
03:50:42,350 --> 03:50:52,299
That sounds pretty good

1905
03:50:52,299 --> 03:50:53,819
uh best

1906
03:50:53,819 --> 03:50:55,819
flavor of ice cream

1907
03:50:56,909 --> 03:51:00,110
Okay, make this a little smaller

1908
03:51:04,270 --> 03:51:11,370
um

1909
03:51:11,370 --> 03:51:12,409
worst

1910
03:51:12,409 --> 03:51:14,409
Worst category

1911
03:51:14,969 --> 03:51:17,850
I like that. I don't know why it's such a stupid thing

1912
03:51:18,489 --> 03:51:28,250
Spelled cat doesn't matter

1913
03:51:28,250 --> 03:51:32,409
So that's one two, three, four, five, six, seven eight nine ten eleven. I want about 15

1914
03:51:33,790 --> 03:51:40,750
Worst stream worst joke worst hair worst joke that took more than five minutes worst character worst chat experience and that means

1915
03:51:41,549 --> 03:51:44,440
What experience you had right? We're talking

1916
03:51:45,959 --> 03:51:49,639
Uh, like octogen like how unbearable was that chat, right?

1917
03:51:51,360 --> 03:52:10,559
You can nominate the worst chat experience best noise best noise. Okay, so we got best worst noise best noise

1918
03:52:23,639 --> 03:52:27,360
Stop no best characters

1919
03:52:29,760 --> 03:52:31,760
No, we're gonna have worst new character

1920
03:52:39,149 --> 03:52:44,750
I think these are all right because remember each one of these i'm gonna I get to cut together a presentation for them

1921
03:52:48,600 --> 03:52:53,879
So for over for if for instance, so the nomination process is only we only got about a day to do this

1922
03:52:57,920 --> 03:53:02,959
So i'm whatever it's probably going to be about six to ten nominees. I'd say somewhere around six is probably good

1923
03:53:04,030 --> 03:53:07,709
And me and the mods are going to pick the nominees based on suggestions

1924
03:53:08,520 --> 03:53:09,639
Whatever ones, you know

1925
03:53:09,639 --> 03:53:12,440
If people are writing a bunch of the same one people have different suggestions

1926
03:53:12,760 --> 03:53:18,040
The nominees are going to be put into the categories and we're gonna be i'm not going to be streaming over the next two days

1927
03:53:18,040 --> 03:53:24,510
This is very important. Very very very very important. I am not going to be able to announce to you guys

1928
03:53:24,989 --> 03:53:29,790
Hey, uh, so the you can vote now go and vote right? I'm not going to be able to do that

1929
03:53:30,350 --> 03:53:34,139
So just know you got to know this after today

1930
03:53:34,219 --> 03:53:37,260
You won't see me till new year's eve because i'm going to be working on this for the next two straight days

1931
03:53:40,680 --> 03:53:42,760
So the voting is going to happen

1932
03:53:43,930 --> 03:53:45,770
Off stream when i'm not there

1933
03:53:45,770 --> 03:53:48,250
You're just going to have to check in on the discord over the next day or so

1934
03:53:48,729 --> 03:53:54,409
Because the voting the categories are going to be up there. The nominations will stop tomorrow night and the voting will stop

1935
03:53:55,319 --> 03:53:57,079
uh

1936
03:53:57,079 --> 03:54:04,120
Not even probably 12 hours after that because then the whole next day i'm going to be working all day to cut up these presentations

1937
03:54:07,040 --> 03:54:14,110
So let's think about this worst stream worst joke worst hair best noise best overall use of cardboard

1938
03:54:14,969 --> 03:54:23,360
Uh, best flavor of ice cream worst use of music and best use of music

1939
03:54:26,239 --> 03:54:29,850
Oh, hold on. I gotta get back over here and collect these

1940
03:54:30,649 --> 03:54:39,209
Oh, that doesn't stack. It's not a stacking backpack. Shit. Okay. That's good. How you doing frog musk?

1941
03:54:43,690 --> 03:54:46,010
I mean, okay this work this worst we could do

1942
03:54:46,729 --> 03:54:51,479
Who the hell is this?

1943
03:54:51,479 --> 03:54:56,139
This the mechanical shop owner quick get out there get go go go get that stuff

1944
03:55:01,530 --> 03:55:03,530
Fuck you. She did it right when I got there. Ah

1945
03:55:04,600 --> 03:55:09,959
Get back in here

1946
03:55:09,959 --> 03:55:15,079
I mean this is also you could also do worst. Okay, worst overall stream worst overall joke. What about worst overall moment?

1947
03:55:16,010 --> 03:55:32,989
Right close the door. I got it. Don't do too many categories

1948
03:55:33,469 --> 03:55:37,709
Yeah, I mean because each category is going to take about five to ten minutes to get through them

1949
03:55:40,409 --> 03:55:44,489
Coming up with these on the fly. Oh, yeah, because this this came up less than four hours ago

1950
03:55:44,489 --> 03:55:47,899
Five hours ago is that and I got the studio time so it's happening

1951
03:55:50,540 --> 03:55:52,540

worst overall stream

1957
03:56:22,649 --> 03:56:25,930
I can make sure but I don't think I want to do best overall stream because that's like oh

1958
03:56:25,930 --> 03:56:29,049
What was the best stream? I want to know what the worst fucking stream was

1959
03:56:35,440 --> 03:56:52,620
Best clip. All right, that'll tell that's all right best clip. I think that's pretty good

03:56:53,719 --> 03:56:58,040
One two, three, four, five six, seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen

1961
03:57:05,629 --> 03:57:07,790
That's just the most used clip. Yeah

1962
03:57:10,780 --> 03:57:13,420
Uh, I got a better idea. Yeah, best clip is not going to work out

1963
03:57:16,680 --> 03:57:27,229
Find that one for me guys

1964
03:57:27,229 --> 03:57:29,229
Okay, here's the two categories that are coming up

1965
03:57:37,879 --> 03:57:44,969
I hate this category so much but it's going on there. I've done it so many times that you could like very I don't know

1966
03:57:51,100 --> 03:57:54,379
I'm gonna be up in a suit at the podium like going over these

1967
03:57:55,020 --> 03:57:57,020
We're gonna have to sit through and watch those

1968
03:58:01,979 --> 03:58:03,979
They're all the worst

1969
03:58:08,459 --> 03:58:13,420
All right, we can't get too crazy because I only have like I gotta i'm gonna put in like triple time to make this a reality

1970
03:58:14,059 --> 03:58:18,799
So I don't we got literally today into tomorrow afternoon

1971
03:58:19,739 --> 03:58:22,059
to nominate and then from there forward

1972
03:58:22,780 --> 03:58:24,219
less than a day

1973
03:58:24,219 --> 03:58:30,350
For voting so we really can't go. This was just a last second idea that I thought was gonna be fun. So

1974
03:58:31,069 --> 03:58:38,000
Let me make sure we got 15 right is it 15?

1975
03:58:38,719 --> 03:58:43,520

03:58:55,069 --> 03:59:00,040
How the my oh shit, I you're right. Hold on. All right, you're working back on this you are

03:59:15,549 --> 03:59:18,989
Where has it been enough times that i've had like sweat all over me on stream?

1981
03:59:30,440 --> 03:59:32,139
Worst sweat

1982
03:59:32,139 --> 03:59:34,219
Okay. Now that yeah, i'll put it on there

1983
03:59:38,719 --> 03:59:40,719
So let's go with worst

1984
03:59:44,030 --> 03:59:45,389

1985
03:59:45,389 --> 03:59:48,000

1986
03:59:48,000 --> 03:59:50,000
Or greasy moment

1987
03:59:50,000 --> 03:59:52,479
No, just worse that you get the idea worst sweat

1988
03:59:54,479 --> 03:59:57,840
worst game no, I don't the worst game that's

1989
04:00:03,930 --> 04:00:07,709
loudest scream, but the loudest scream doesn't work because all you have to do is just

1990
04:00:08,649 --> 04:00:10,649
Listen to which one was the loudest?

1991
04:00:15,290 --> 04:00:18,219
worst breakdown

1992
04:00:18,219 --> 04:00:20,219
On stream, that's a good one

1993
04:00:21,520 --> 04:00:23,600
All right. I think we're good. I think we're good. This is a lot

1994
04:00:23,760 --> 04:00:25,760
This is a lot of categories

1995
04:00:36,079 --> 04:00:37,120
best

1996
04:00:37,120 --> 04:00:41,659
best gnome

1997
04:00:41,659 --> 04:00:45,020
That no, what do you mean best? No, i'm not gonna do a best gnome

1998
04:00:49,469 --> 04:00:52,750
I gotta put these back in a better place here. So we got best

1999
04:00:53,389 --> 04:00:59,629
Let's cut this because the best is gonna be on a different section. You know what i'm saying? This is gonna be like this

2000
04:01:01,440 --> 04:01:05,579
Anything that's worst has to be I don't want that many best

2001
04:01:08,889 --> 04:01:11,209
Okay, so it's all worst worst worst worst

2002
04:01:16,219 --> 04:01:21,639
Get that here

2003
04:01:21,719 --> 04:01:23,719
I can't wait to do this one

2004
04:01:23,959 --> 04:01:27,159
I can't do the worst the worst peter and best peter on like on

2005
04:01:27,799 --> 04:01:29,239
On new year's eve

2006
04:01:29,239 --> 04:01:35,840
That's gonna be hard not to just crack and laugh my ass off during that because what a stupid fucking category

2007
04:01:46,719 --> 04:01:52,170
Best green screen. No, no, no because that wasn't a contest and I don't want to say that it was you know

2008
04:01:52,170 --> 04:02:06,989
I mean to work how you guys doing on food worst analogy. Well, we don't want to get super crazy specific because

2009
04:02:08,040 --> 04:02:09,799
There's only really

2010
04:02:09,799 --> 04:02:12,600
You guys remember like the worst analogy. You remember what stream it was

2011
04:02:14,010 --> 04:02:18,489
Because think about it you've got there's the archive channel that has every stream of the last year, right?

2012
04:02:18,969 --> 04:02:25,979
But like you're gonna go back and figure it all out. You only got like one day to figure that out

2013
04:02:30,520 --> 04:02:36,510
Do not underestimate best gamer moment. Oh, I like it best game. Okay, we're done here

2014
04:02:36,989 --> 04:02:50,600
Best gamer moment worst gamer moment and that's good because I can tell you there's been at least at least two

2015
04:02:51,159 --> 04:02:54,360
Best gamer moments i'm gonna oh wait, they might even be like one or two

2016
04:02:54,840 --> 04:03:01,180
But that's even funnier to me that there's only one nominee or two and there's like 20 nominees for worst

2017
04:03:05,360 --> 04:03:09,920
Yeah, best best jex moment and worst germa gaming moment. Yeah, and that's it

2018
04:03:12,219 --> 04:03:16,520
I gotta call it there because it's gonna take a lot of time. So and some of these categories

2019
04:03:16,920 --> 04:03:31,149
I might have to just straight up delete like the ice cream one's fine. I want to know what you guys think. There you go

2020
04:03:32,829 --> 04:03:42,510
Let me move this worse. All right, let's go over these one more time

2021
04:03:44,329 --> 04:03:51,680
So we've got oops wrong thing

2022
04:03:54,090 --> 04:03:56,350
So here are your categories

2023
04:03:58,520 --> 04:04:05,319
One two, three, four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seven seventeen categories

2024
04:04:08,090 --> 04:04:12,090
Worst so here you go worst overall stream. What is the worst member?

2025
04:04:12,329 --> 04:04:23,610
What is the worst fucking stream that i've done in the whole year? Think about it. There's a lot of streams this year

2026
04:04:23,690 --> 04:04:27,930
What is the worst one i've done that you were just like that stream was fucking terrible, right?

2027
04:04:29,719 --> 04:04:34,520
What is the worst joke that i've done this year that you were just like that wasn't funny. That was just not funny

2028
04:04:34,680 --> 04:04:42,139
Uh, I didn't think it was funny to you. That was awful. There's been a couple of those probably at least one worst hair

2029
04:04:44,409 --> 04:04:48,090
You turned on the stream and you saw the face came and you were like, whoa, holy fuck

2030
04:04:48,649 --> 04:04:56,600
That looks really bad worst joke taking more than five minutes to set up

2031
04:04:57,159 --> 04:05:01,600
Sometimes I will pause the stream and I will go do something and in five ten minutes

2032
04:05:01,600 --> 04:05:03,760
We'll go by and i'll come back and like press play on it

2033
04:05:04,399 --> 04:05:09,399
And it's awful that's happened sometimes and to even it out. We'll do okay fine

2034
04:05:09,399 --> 04:05:27,920
We'll do best joke taking more than five minutes to set up as well to you know, even it out because that's 18

2035
04:05:36,170 --> 04:05:41,340
All right. So you got worst joke taking more than five minutes best choke taking more than five minutes to set up

2036
04:05:41,979 --> 04:05:44,219
Worst new character. There's been a handful of characters

2037
04:05:44,299 --> 04:05:51,389
It's been about five to ten new characters that you've seen on stream, which is the one that is the worst

2038
04:05:57,229 --> 04:06:05,319
What was your worst chat experience where you were looking at the chat room and you just

2039
04:06:06,120 --> 04:06:10,680
Holy shit, man. You guys need to chill the fuck out. Like what are you guys doing? This chat sucks

2040
04:06:10,680 --> 04:06:19,000
Like one of those moments. So think about that

2041
04:06:21,309 --> 04:06:24,030
What I don't know how i'm gonna do that by the way

2042
04:06:25,069 --> 04:06:27,069
Because I don't have access

2043
04:06:27,840 --> 04:06:29,520
It doesn't matter

2044
04:06:29,520 --> 04:06:35,690
Uh, worst noise that i've made that you hated that you wish I never make again

2045
04:06:38,600 --> 04:06:41,239
worst new meme that you guys say

2046
04:06:46,280 --> 04:06:47,559
worst

2047
04:06:47,559 --> 04:06:52,840
new meme

2048
04:06:52,840 --> 04:06:58,440
Okay, something that came from just something that on the channel or something that we said that you say that I say

2049
04:06:59,370 --> 04:07:01,290
Not a joke, but like a reference meme thing

2050
04:07:01,290 --> 04:07:06,170
You know what I mean the worst category of the year here

2051
04:07:08,219 --> 04:07:15,739
Why is that up here? It's kind of i'm not even

2052
04:07:24,969 --> 04:07:26,889
Worst internet

2053
04:07:26,889 --> 04:07:28,889
issue from last year

2054
04:07:28,889 --> 04:07:34,639
Where it was unwatchable to a point or you just hated it and it was awful and you left the stream

2055
04:07:34,959 --> 04:07:45,760
The best noise that I made all year in, you know contrast to the worst one best overall use of cardboard

2056
04:07:46,079 --> 04:07:53,739
There's been a couple a few times where that's happened, you know, what's your best flavor of ice cream?

2057
04:07:54,219 --> 04:07:56,540
No, just delete this one. This one sucks

2058
04:07:57,100 --> 04:08:08,159
That's gonna win worst category keep it. That's the best one

2059
04:08:09,659 --> 04:08:13,819
No, but like that's good

2060
04:08:13,899 --> 04:08:17,260
All right, find best flavor of ice cream nominate your favorite ones

2061
04:08:17,659 --> 04:08:29,100
We need the worst peter and we need the best peter and then we need the worst

2062
04:08:30,190 --> 04:08:35,819
Worst one is more fuck. Uh worst sweat moment for you

2063
04:08:35,979 --> 04:08:41,739
I just was disgusting to look at and you couldn't take it and the worst breakdown I had on stream in 2018

2064
04:08:41,739 --> 04:08:43,719
Remember these all have to be

2065
04:08:43,719 --> 04:08:45,719
2018 you can't go back

2066
04:08:45,739 --> 04:08:48,780
like oh remember when like he told stardom

2067
04:08:49,319 --> 04:08:53,319
Remember when he made that video? No, no, no, no 2018 this last year

2068
04:09:04,510 --> 04:09:11,520
No, we can't I it's gonna take so much work for me to put this together already a good 18 categories is gonna be fine

2069
04:09:18,520 --> 04:09:22,920
I can't even say that out loud because I don't want to give you bias, but somebody just said something really funny

2070
04:09:26,639 --> 04:09:31,879
Uh

2071
04:09:31,879 --> 04:09:37,579
All right, no, no best jebait worst jebait. I can't this I this isn't your categories

2072
04:09:37,659 --> 04:09:42,489
I can't do much more

2073
04:09:42,489 --> 04:09:48,329
One two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen

2074
04:09:49,920 --> 04:09:52,700
no gamer moments, uh

2075
04:09:52,700 --> 04:09:56,159
Where are they? Did they not get in?

2076
04:09:58,040 --> 04:10:00,120
It was best and worst gamer moment. Did I type it in?

2077
04:10:00,760 --> 04:10:21,100
Apparently not

2078
04:10:21,100 --> 04:10:23,100
All right. Now that's 20 categories

2079
04:10:23,420 --> 04:10:35,180
Let me separate them again so you can take a get a good look at it because best needs to be done

2080
04:10:36,569 --> 04:10:41,120
I'm actually gonna do this

2081
04:10:41,120 --> 04:10:43,360
Uh, yeah, let's go like this instead

2082
04:10:44,079 --> 04:10:49,709
We'll start with the best just because that you know, obviously

2083
04:10:55,209 --> 04:10:58,010
Worst internet issue or it's noise. Okay

2084
04:11:04,139 --> 04:11:05,659
worst hair

2085
04:11:05,659 --> 04:11:09,680
Okay

2086
04:11:09,680 --> 04:11:14,239
Because the the culmination of this whole thing guys is the worst stream of the year is the big award

2087
04:11:14,879 --> 04:11:20,590
That's the big one. So that everything's there, right? One, two, three, four

2088
04:11:21,549 --> 04:11:26,090
Eight, nine, ten, eleven, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, what happened to what happened to one?

2089
04:11:28,010 --> 04:11:35,549
Did one get removed?

2090
04:11:35,549 --> 04:11:44,750
Which one got removed?

2091
04:11:44,750 --> 04:11:58,750
Best best flavor of ice cream peter. All right. There you are. There are your 20 categories

2092
04:11:59,690 --> 04:12:02,829
so

2093
04:12:02,829 --> 04:12:05,159
in

2094
04:12:05,159 --> 04:12:15,709
We're gonna have rules here in there's a channel on the discord right now. The channel is called nominees

2095
04:12:16,430 --> 04:12:18,760
what you're going to do

2096
04:12:18,760 --> 04:12:21,000
is

2097
04:12:21,000 --> 04:12:23,000
You don't just like spam

2098
04:12:24,379 --> 04:12:28,219
In that channel you have to do just like in previous setups

2099
04:12:30,489 --> 04:12:36,010
You need to post your nominations in that thread in the format of what the category is

2100
04:12:38,709 --> 04:12:42,040
category

2101
04:12:42,040 --> 04:12:45,319
And your nominee, right? So you have to type it in

2102
04:12:46,040 --> 04:12:48,350
What's the category dash?

2103
04:12:48,750 --> 04:12:50,989
Here's the moment i'm talking about dash

2104
04:12:52,590 --> 04:12:56,059
Where it is because it's you can't just write

2105
04:12:56,459 --> 04:13:02,139
Oh go to uh, remember the stream you did when you like fucking bit your finger and you like farted

2106
04:13:02,620 --> 04:13:05,979
I have no idea what you're talking about. You're gonna have to give me a link to either a clip

2107
04:13:06,540 --> 04:13:10,940
or to a a timestamp to a video and again, there is the

2108
04:13:11,340 --> 04:13:12,059
uh

2109
04:13:12,059 --> 04:13:19,020
The vod channel has a shitload of these almost all of these streams that i've ever done in 2018 are on that channel

2110
04:13:24,299 --> 04:13:26,299
So we need to know

2111
04:13:26,620 --> 04:13:28,559
What stream it was?

2112
04:13:28,559 --> 04:13:34,860
And a timestamp if you have it or clip because it's going to be hard to figure that out if you just write a random sentence

2113
04:13:37,600 --> 04:13:41,840
So either if it was something that happened in the last 60 days twitch is fine

2114
04:13:42,559 --> 04:13:46,479
You can clip it if you want if it's happened recently and you know put it in there

2115
04:13:46,799 --> 04:13:53,319
But if it's something that happened a long time ago back in like january or february something then we're going to need timestamps

2116
04:13:53,639 --> 04:13:58,170
which is on the uh

2117
04:13:58,170 --> 04:14:06,120
There's a channel that is the archive channel, although it's not an official channel. Uh, i've talked to the

2118
04:14:06,920 --> 04:14:16,329
Owner of the channel a few times then that is it's a huge resource. So again

2119
04:14:16,889 --> 04:14:21,559
That channel is not for talking. It's currently locked right now

2120
04:14:21,879 --> 04:14:26,670
But that channel is only for nominations. Remember you got it. I'm gonna let's paste it here

2121
04:14:30,540 --> 04:14:36,989
I think you grump clump with this great format here. All right. Here you go. Bingo

2122
04:14:37,629 --> 04:14:47,340
That's what you need to do

2123
04:14:47,340 --> 04:15:02,270
And if the hour minute seconds I did that can someone put me back in the discord?

2124
04:15:02,829 --> 04:15:04,719
What

2125
04:15:04,719 --> 04:15:09,680
What about worst category is worst category is right. It's there worst category

2126
04:15:09,680 --> 04:15:20,350
You gotta pick whatever category that you hear that you think sucks. I want to make sure everyone gets it

2127
04:15:21,209 --> 04:15:25,549
Do we do we get it because i'm not going to be able to talk about this again until new year's eve

2128
04:15:26,969 --> 04:15:28,489
so once

2129
04:15:28,489 --> 04:15:34,120
Me and the mods whoever wants to help work on it. We're going to pull out nominations

2130
04:15:34,120 --> 04:15:36,760
There is no it's just like the christmas stream

2131
04:15:37,159 --> 04:15:42,920
We're gonna find you know ones and maybe uh, oh this one this particular one like 10 people have nominated this

2132
04:15:43,399 --> 04:15:44,920
20 people have said this same thing

2133
04:15:44,920 --> 04:15:50,010
Oh, you know like this guy said, you know, we're gonna pull them out for just like the suggestions for christmas then

2134
04:15:51,219 --> 04:15:52,920
tomorrow night

2135
04:15:52,920 --> 04:15:59,399
Voting is going to be open for about 24 hours. Not even maybe 12 hours because I gotta start working on this

2136
04:16:00,620 --> 04:16:07,469
So I will not be able to tell you this again discord discord. They will be that channel is going to be there. They will be another

2137
04:16:08,190 --> 04:16:10,670
Major there'll be another channel probably put up that is

2138
04:16:11,469 --> 04:16:16,889
Voting and there will be a link to a voting website

2139
04:16:18,829 --> 04:16:20,829
It'll be there within the next 24 hours

2140
04:16:30,139 --> 04:16:37,899
Yeah, and i'm that this channel is going to open in about probably like an hour or so probably like an hour or two

2141
04:16:38,969 --> 04:16:45,000
Post an example for the channel. Okay here is here's an example for instance category, uh worst

2142
04:16:45,879 --> 04:16:49,559
stream of the year, right like well or we worst, uh

2143
04:16:50,200 --> 04:16:52,200
Worst overall stream make sure we keep we keep them

2144
04:16:52,989 --> 04:16:55,229
You got to use the the text that you see on the screen here

2145
04:16:55,920 --> 04:17:02,000
So worst overall stream make sure the text is correct take a screenshot right now if you have to worst overall stream

2146
04:17:03,209 --> 04:17:07,129
Uh link to the moment. Let's say that's uh, you know

2147
04:17:07,610 --> 04:17:14,399
Hey, I i'm just I pick this stream because and then maybe maybe like uh, for instance like link to moment

2148
04:17:14,399 --> 04:17:18,239
I'm going to fake website link like a hyperlink, right?

2149
04:17:19,129 --> 04:17:21,129
And then if you can do a timestamp in there as well

2150
04:17:21,129 --> 04:17:27,479
That's good, and maybe you could give like a dash maybe like a sentence, you know, he

2151
04:17:28,459 --> 04:17:30,459
was shitfaced

2152
04:17:30,459 --> 04:17:31,739
and couldn't

2153
04:17:31,739 --> 04:17:33,440
figure out

2154
04:17:33,440 --> 04:17:35,950
How to open the door?

2155
04:17:37,280 --> 04:17:43,079
And you know you give like you can give like a small maybe like one sentence reason, you know what I mean?

2156
04:17:46,270 --> 04:17:49,149
Timestamp hour. Let's see like for instance like one

2157
04:17:49,709 --> 04:17:52,750
At 34 here's a perfect example of why I think this

2158
04:17:53,559 --> 04:17:58,989
You know like here let me go category worst overall stream link to moment fake website link

2159
04:17:58,989 --> 04:18:02,590
Oh, he was shitfaced and he couldn't figure out whatever timestamp if if you can do it

2160
04:18:03,549 --> 04:18:05,870
Hour 34 right for a reason

2161
04:18:11,129 --> 04:18:14,090
And that is also the reason why this stream is going to be cut short tonight

2162
04:18:14,090 --> 04:18:22,239
I'm not stopping now, but please don't post if no, no, no, I mean like i'm you don't post any fake links

2163
04:18:28,030 --> 04:18:31,290
Thanks for making a copy pasta

2164
04:18:31,370 --> 04:18:41,520
Yeah, it'll be the rules will be there. I'm in studio on New Year's eve again 7 pm eastern. Sorry 7 pm pacific

2165
04:18:43,239 --> 04:18:46,840
I already have a bunch of the stuff ordered that's ready to go. This is the only thing we got to do

2166
04:18:47,319 --> 04:18:57,600
And we have about three days to get it ready. Somebody just wrote already got the worst noise boys

2167
04:18:58,239 --> 04:19:06,479
Are you allowed to use clips from other streamers points of view?

2168
04:19:07,440 --> 04:19:10,079
um

2169
04:19:10,079 --> 04:19:15,440
As long as it happened in the last year and it's somebody that I know personally, you know what I mean?

2170
04:19:19,639 --> 04:19:23,719
I can't spell cat. It doesn't matter. I just wrote it. I did fast. I don't have grammarly installed

2171
04:19:26,399 --> 04:19:31,360
So, uh, i'm i'm before the stream is over. I'm gonna put this back up. But here are your categories

2172
04:19:33,420 --> 04:19:35,739
That channel will open in an hour or two

2173
04:19:36,299 --> 04:19:41,360
Just getting set up. So think about it now, you know, think about it while you're here

2174
04:19:41,920 --> 04:19:50,350
You know while you have a moment, you know, like one person

2175
04:19:50,909 --> 04:19:53,069
What?

2176
04:19:53,069 --> 04:19:56,420
kim

2177
04:19:56,420 --> 04:19:57,479
italics

2178
04:19:57,479 --> 04:20:01,389
Star, I don't I don't really know. I mean very many people

2179
04:20:11,440 --> 04:20:17,790
Vinny

2180
04:20:17,790 --> 04:20:18,989
burger boy

2181
04:20:18,989 --> 04:20:29,129
Are we both hitting this?

2182
04:20:29,129 --> 04:20:30,329
drake

2183
04:20:30,329 --> 04:20:42,829
But yeah that I mean when we talked about earlier, but cutting the stream short it is to get that ready

2184
04:20:45,129 --> 04:20:51,850
Because once I know the timestamps once I know the clips once I know I have to make them put them together add effects to it

2185
04:20:54,059 --> 04:20:56,379
make little presentations for all the categories

2186
04:20:58,540 --> 04:21:01,500
And that's going to take me at least a couple of days to do

2187
04:21:11,719 --> 04:21:15,000
Will drake be at germa con there is no such thing as germa con

2188
04:21:21,850 --> 04:21:23,850
Dabs for dinner. Thanks for the five dollars

2189
04:21:24,760 --> 04:21:26,760
And we're almost done doing this

2190
04:21:26,840 --> 04:21:31,469
I'm not going to fill the whole inventory. There's only so much hit

2191
04:21:31,950 --> 04:21:34,270
Uh rock with stick you guys can handle

2192
04:21:39,719 --> 04:21:43,559
So again, i'm sorry for like it's gonna end up being like a five hour stream tonight

2193
04:21:46,540 --> 04:21:48,620
But this will be fun. It will be a fun night

2194
04:21:54,969 --> 04:21:59,610
Five five five community subs not five dollars. Thank you for the five community subs

04:22:21,440 --> 04:22:27,200

That's it. Yeah. Yeah, let's go. Let's go. I got plenty of shit

2199
04:22:30,600 --> 04:22:33,319
People are getting hungry. I got to feed myself

04:22:34,040 --> 04:22:46,000
It's the store, right? Yeah

2201
04:22:46,000 --> 04:22:47,920

All right sell value. Okay

2208
04:23:12,680 --> 04:23:18,670
That's not bad. These prices aren't that great, but it's okay

2209
04:23:20,090 --> 04:23:22,090
1751 we got a lot of these

2210
04:23:23,049 --> 04:23:30,180
All the money I spent is back. That's good. It feels pretty good

2211
04:23:30,819 --> 04:23:38,700
Almost a 10 000 again

2212
04:23:38,700 --> 04:23:40,700
No, what do you have?

2213
04:23:41,530 --> 04:23:45,450
building materials spring steel steel bars. Don't I need some of this stuff?

2214
04:23:48,250 --> 04:23:50,010
Leather high vest

2215
04:23:50,010 --> 04:23:58,969
Nobody has anything else. No, uh

price markup 77

2220
04:24:11,340 --> 04:24:14,659
I need iron plates

2221
04:24:14,819 --> 04:24:19,479
How many do I need?

2222
04:24:19,559 --> 04:24:21,559
I know I need at least probably five to ten of these

2223
04:24:22,040 --> 04:24:33,209
It's four for the dummies and then I should just buy the whole store

2224
04:24:38,069 --> 04:24:39,750
because these are

2225
04:24:39,750 --> 04:24:45,530
No, okay, whatever. There's a lot of other weird oddities in here. Look at all this fish

2226
04:24:48,549 --> 04:24:51,829
Books, dimminy you just regular food. Whoa, that's a lot of food

2227

Hello. Hello. Um

2231
04:25:03,180 --> 04:25:05,540
Why do you do this to the hive?

2232
04:25:05,540 --> 04:25:11,000
Let's trade

2233
04:25:11,000 --> 04:25:17,079
um, hello

2234
04:25:17,079 --> 04:25:22,729
Jesus I don't even know where they came from. Okay

2235
04:25:24,600 --> 04:25:27,479
Well, I sold everything

2236
04:25:27,479 --> 04:25:29,479
I got the plates I need

2237
04:25:29,559 --> 04:25:31,559
I can go back

2238
04:25:31,719 --> 04:25:33,959
Home with 8900 bucks

2239
04:25:34,760 --> 04:25:41,459
Then they have 9300

2240
04:25:41,459 --> 04:25:43,459
Who took 300 bucks from me?

2241
04:25:53,579 --> 04:25:54,540
Me

2242
04:25:54,540 --> 04:26:01,420
It was weird. I'll pay you back. Oh, hey. Hey, thanks, man

2243
04:26:02,059 --> 04:26:09,879
Let's get out of here

2244
04:26:09,879 --> 04:26:11,399
Uh, can you

2245
04:26:11,399 --> 04:26:12,760
Why are you doing this?

2246
04:26:12,760 --> 04:26:16,950
There we go. So we have plenty of money again

2247
04:26:17,989 --> 04:26:20,229
Got the plates for the dummies. It's time to go back and train

2248
04:26:22,920 --> 04:26:24,920
Are they raiding me?

2249
04:26:24,920 --> 04:26:27,420
I hope not

2250
04:26:27,420 --> 04:26:29,020
Take us back to stack

2251
04:26:29,020 --> 04:26:34,760
Probably nothing gets buy the lantern buy the lantern buy the lantern

2252
04:26:36,809 --> 04:26:38,809
You're right. I should buy the lantern

2253
04:26:38,809 --> 04:26:52,739
It's hard to see through this rain

2254
04:26:52,739 --> 04:26:54,790
Show me what you got

2255
04:26:54,790 --> 04:26:57,690
Where's this lantern?

2256
04:26:57,690 --> 04:26:59,530
Lantern of radiance

2257
04:26:59,530 --> 04:27:04,920
An old lantern. It looks pretty beaten up and barely functions. There are some worn out scratchings on it

2258
04:27:04,920 --> 04:27:06,920
Which look like the crude drawings of a child

2259
04:27:12,180 --> 04:27:15,770
Um, it's 40

2260
04:27:16,170 --> 04:27:20,139
It's only 45 cents

2261
04:27:20,139 --> 04:27:28,459
Should I get a bulb?

2262
04:27:28,459 --> 04:27:31,139
Okay

2263
04:27:31,139 --> 04:27:35,020
Well, this is a standard first aid kit. Yeah, i'll get this

2264
04:27:35,659 --> 04:27:43,780
I don't really need any of the other things

2265
04:27:46,969 --> 04:27:52,569
All right back to town with the plates to make the training dummies and then bank the money

2266
04:27:57,299 --> 04:27:59,940
I need the lantern for the lore. That's the most important part

2267
04:28:02,360 --> 04:28:05,670
Save it

2268
04:28:05,670 --> 04:28:07,959
Not again

2269

04:42:12,310 --> 04:42:14,310
I feel like subconsciously

2398
04:42:14,709 --> 04:42:17,750
A lot of you guys are trying to make it this one

2399
04:42:19,659 --> 04:42:28,459
It's subconsciously up here. It's not even intentional

2400
04:42:33,590 --> 04:42:35,590
Two people are working. What are you doing?

2401
04:42:41,799 --> 04:42:49,380
I need way more than that. I guess I could do storage or let's see storage

2402
04:42:50,020 --> 04:42:52,939
animal feeder

2403
04:42:52,939 --> 04:42:58,220
Wait, does this mean I can feed the dog will feed itself?

2404
04:42:58,939 --> 04:43:04,380
Bolt box armor storage. There's so much general storage. Oh, there's so many things

2405
04:43:05,020 --> 04:43:17,500
Well, it's all right. Don't worry. The stream is turning off in like 20 minutes anyways because I have to get started

2406
04:43:22,900 --> 04:43:24,419
No, no

2407
04:43:24,419 --> 04:43:26,740
What the fuck? What the fuck?

2408
04:43:28,490 --> 04:43:29,849
I told I told you guys earlier

2409
04:43:29,849 --> 04:43:42,299
I have to I need to get working on the new year's evening at the beginning of the stream

2410
04:43:42,380 --> 04:43:45,580
I said this is only going to be like a few hours because I really need to get working on it

2411
04:43:45,580 --> 04:43:48,540
We need to get started on this shit. I got to start buying things making

2412
04:43:49,400 --> 04:43:52,380
Presentations I got to get a suit like I got the podium

2413
04:43:53,099 --> 04:43:55,419
And it's still early enough where I can get some of the stuff done now

2414
04:43:55,819 --> 04:44:04,139
It's gonna be worth it. Trust me. All right you

2415
04:44:05,080 --> 04:44:14,740
Train on that lock box you what do you go? Mustard five. Am I gonna stream on the 30th?

2416
04:44:14,740 --> 04:44:29,209
I'm not you'll not see me again until the stream turns on on new year's eve after new year's eve

2417
04:44:30,900 --> 04:44:32,900
Because there's been a couple of these streams

2418
04:44:33,909 --> 04:44:38,470
That have been that took more time to do at the end of the year kind of holiday stuff

2419
04:44:39,590 --> 04:44:49,830
We're gonna who the hell is this? Okay, a hung hungry bandits are just here. What are they doing in here?

2420
04:44:50,310 --> 04:45:11,939
Because he's leaving he's gonna get shot with a crossbow. I don't understand

2421
04:45:16,279 --> 04:45:18,279
Why do they take so long to attack him?

2422
04:45:21,619 --> 04:45:25,459
I love when they do this shit. They all freak out when somebody dies

2423
04:45:34,919 --> 04:45:45,639
Work on your training. God damn it. Can more than one person use this? No, but

2424
04:45:46,279 --> 04:45:48,060
Yes

2425
04:45:48,060 --> 04:45:52,060
But we're just saying the game looks awesome. The game is very fun. It's okay. Here's what I was gonna say

2426
04:45:52,540 --> 04:45:54,060
Oh, don't be calendar

2427
04:45:54,060 --> 04:45:56,229

04:46:02,470 --> 04:46:03,659
So

2430
04:46:07,080 --> 04:46:10,040
after new year's eve

2431
04:46:10,040 --> 04:46:12,040
There's not going to be a stream on

2432
04:46:12,759 --> 04:46:16,330

04:46:32,970 --> 04:46:38,729
Uh, what am I gonna hold on? I gotta think about this. I actually have to think about what i'm gonna do about this

2436
04:46:39,689 --> 04:46:41,529
Because I have to

2437
04:46:41,529 --> 04:46:43,529

2445
04:47:06,919 --> 04:47:11,080
January 3rd. There is not going to be a stream because I have something I have something I have to do on the third

2446
04:47:13,459 --> 04:47:19,770

2450
04:47:43,810 --> 04:47:49,400
We'll do four days in a row because it's been really all over the place with these

2451
04:47:50,200 --> 04:47:54,549
Other streams that have been worked on right? We'll do four in a row

2452
04:47:55,400 --> 04:47:58,279
There's a lot of shit that I want to do. Uh, there's visceral cleanup detail. There's

2453
04:47:58,919 --> 04:48:01,279
Uh the frog crew

2454
04:48:01,360 --> 04:48:07,750
There's i'm trying to think of the other things that I want to do

2455
04:48:08,310 --> 04:48:10,310
There's metal gear rising

2456
04:48:10,310 --> 04:48:14,439
There's

2457
04:48:14,439 --> 04:48:16,439
I don't know. There's a lot of things to do

2458
04:48:16,680 --> 04:48:21,090
I need to look at like a list

2459
04:48:21,090 --> 04:48:26,229
On the 23rd i'm going to be in a full goalie outfit. So that's obviously happening

2460
04:48:27,090 --> 04:48:29,409
i'm that's going to be an irl stream where I sit there and just

2461
04:48:30,130 --> 04:48:33,889
In a full goalie costume just scared for like four hours

2462
04:48:42,840 --> 04:48:43,880
this

2463
04:48:43,880 --> 04:48:47,000
I haven't played metal gear riot. No, I haven't that's why it's gonna be fun to do

2464
04:48:47,560 --> 04:48:53,509
I feel like roth is being really really useless right now and you know, who else is being useless this dog

2465
04:48:53,909 --> 04:49:07,430
The dog has not done anything the whole time just exists, but that's okay kids a companion. All right, what's your uh, you

2466
04:49:07,990 --> 04:49:18,200
You are looking you need to go do something while everybody trains. What can I do with you?

2467
04:49:18,840 --> 04:49:29,639
I have some money. I'm gonna look for another companion. I could go on a stealing shopping spree

2468
04:49:30,360 --> 04:49:34,599
Get another companion somewhere lock myself in a cage and see if I can get out

2469
04:49:35,479 --> 04:49:41,830
I go treasure hunting

2470
04:49:41,830 --> 04:49:47,360
Nobody in here

2471
04:49:47,360 --> 04:49:50,819
It's a plastic surgeon

2472
04:49:50,819 --> 04:50:03,060
Let's head this way

2473
04:50:03,060 --> 04:50:06,360
Check this one

2474
04:50:06,360 --> 04:50:12,040
You'd better play metal gear rising with a controller on easy. The parry system will be too jarring for pc only

2475
04:50:13,939 --> 04:50:16,099
oh

2476
04:50:16,099 --> 04:50:18,099
Played on easy played on easy

2477
04:50:19,349 --> 04:50:27,159
Why play it on easy?

2478
04:50:27,159 --> 04:50:29,319
Is that a true statement? Should I be careful with that?

2479
04:50:31,080 --> 04:50:35,080
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no because i'm bad

2480
04:50:35,959 --> 04:50:37,959
We'll just wait to the uh, best gaming moment

2481
04:50:38,520 --> 04:50:40,520
Shit, I can't wait to see that collage

2482
04:50:41,479 --> 04:50:48,450
of moments

2483
04:50:48,450 --> 04:50:51,250
Anybody around for me to I have to go to another town. I think

2484
04:50:52,130 --> 04:50:54,369
Although this is public right? Yeah, let me check in here

2485
04:50:55,090 --> 04:51:03,759
I'm going to play it on easy. Why would I play it on easy?

2486
04:51:06,740 --> 04:51:10,290
any recruits

2487
04:51:10,290 --> 04:51:12,290
That would want to join me

2488
04:51:14,040 --> 04:51:16,040
High inquisitor. Let's see

2489
04:51:19,439 --> 04:51:22,240
Okra's light shines brightly today a good omen. Do you have any work?

2490
04:51:23,729 --> 04:51:25,729
I'm here to bail out a friend

2491
04:51:27,029 --> 04:51:30,549
Ah to pay for your friends heathen sins in the eyes of okra and their time in incarceration

2492
04:51:31,349 --> 04:51:35,270
Has redeemed them of the evil ways, but to shorten their penance the price will be steep

2493
04:51:37,029 --> 04:51:39,400
pay bounty for

2494
04:51:39,400 --> 04:51:42,790
Of no one this guy got work

2495
04:51:43,349 --> 04:51:53,860
Do you have any confiscated goods to sell?

2496
04:51:55,599 --> 04:51:59,759
The holy lord phoenix himself blessed be his name has marked us for the heretics

2497
04:52:00,400 --> 04:52:05,360
Has marked for us the heretics of okra look up for them and bring them to me for holy judgment

2498
04:52:08,819 --> 04:52:12,259
Has it marked for us the heretics of okra? Thanks for the info

2499
04:52:16,950 --> 04:52:26,880
What no do you have any goods to sell? Oh damn you do

2500
04:52:31,200 --> 04:52:33,200
But I don't think any of this stuff is worth taking

2501
04:52:33,599 --> 04:52:37,830
Bring him bounties. Uh, okay

2502
04:52:40,130 --> 04:52:47,560
heart protector

2503
04:52:47,560 --> 04:52:51,959
Can't wait for jerma dying to pinwheel in worst gamer moment. Well, here's the thing about that guys

2504
04:52:52,840 --> 04:52:55,159
Uh, you can't just write that

2505
04:52:55,720 --> 04:53:00,919
You need to have a document you need that needs to be proof. You need to have a time stamp or a clip

2506
04:53:01,799 --> 04:53:03,319
you

2507
04:53:03,319 --> 04:53:05,319
How are you gonna how's that gonna happen?

2508
04:53:06,919 --> 04:53:11,720
Worst gamer moment when he died to pinwheel. Okay, you just said that where's that I have to show it on screen

2509
04:53:12,599 --> 04:53:21,680
It's not as simple as just that's what i'm saying. You can't just be like remember that time when he shit his pants that

2510
04:53:22,560 --> 04:53:24,900
when

2511
04:53:24,900 --> 04:53:26,659
To be nominated

2512
04:53:26,659 --> 04:53:32,709
All this stuff is way too expensive. Although not this is not that bad

2513
04:53:34,099 --> 04:53:35,959
Yes, it is. It's too much

2514
04:53:35,959 --> 04:53:40,119
No, I don't want to spend that kind of money here. I'm just looking for a new companion

2515
04:53:40,759 --> 04:54:09,360
Somebody in here you have shit your pants. It was right after you lost a pinwheel for a second

2516
04:54:09,360 --> 04:54:10,799
I thought you were gonna say

2517
04:54:10,799 --> 04:54:16,479
Just shit your pants right now and then load up dark souls and lose to pinwheel right now. So it's on video

2518
04:54:18,450 --> 04:54:20,930
That's why I thought you were going with that. See if I can open this

2519
04:54:31,880 --> 04:54:35,650
Do all these things now

2520
04:54:35,650 --> 04:54:37,009
All right, let's open

2521
04:54:37,009 --> 04:54:42,950
Success. We're gonna save it

2522
04:54:42,950 --> 04:54:46,150
Oh, and that's a 55 chance to steal. That's it

2523
04:54:47,349 --> 04:54:49,349
Really? This is on this character

2524
04:54:49,430 --> 04:54:52,240
There's another one right here, isn't there?

2525
04:54:52,240 --> 04:54:57,779
This is weapon cabinet

2526
04:54:57,779 --> 04:54:59,939
Those cubes are so good, but only 55 percent

2527
04:55:00,659 --> 04:55:15,159
that's bad

2528
04:55:15,159 --> 04:55:17,159
moon jupiter moon jupiter

2529
04:55:20,840 --> 04:55:23,349
Just unlock everything

2530
04:55:23,349 --> 04:55:25,349
Yeah, it's kind of what i'm trying to do

2531
04:55:26,069 --> 04:55:32,959
I would have figured it happened with a 33 chance to open but apparently we are okay save it

2532
04:55:40,860 --> 04:55:43,200
55 percent these are all so expensive

2533
04:55:44,479 --> 04:55:54,610
I'm gonna be here. Look at all these locked more locked stuff

2534
04:55:55,330 --> 04:55:57,009
metal chest

2535
04:55:57,009 --> 04:55:58,849
This is safe

2536
04:55:58,849 --> 04:56:04,560
Got a first try. All right, what should I I gotta find the important things first

2537
04:56:11,080 --> 04:56:13,080
That's pretty important

2538
04:56:15,439 --> 04:56:22,740
Holy chest plate

2539
04:56:23,139 --> 04:56:29,250
A plastic spork just gave out five community subs

2540
04:56:32,450 --> 04:56:34,450
redemption

2541
04:56:34,549 --> 04:56:36,549
Redemption making amends

2542
04:56:38,759 --> 04:56:42,439
All right, I come but all right, but once all right, but twice

2543
04:56:43,729 --> 04:56:45,490
two times

2544
04:56:45,490 --> 04:56:47,490
How am I supposed to react to this?

2545
04:56:49,490 --> 04:56:52,529
You know what I mean? Okay. So if you're in front of the judge right now

2546
04:56:54,310 --> 04:56:56,630
You know you you you're walking down the street

2547
04:56:57,270 --> 04:57:00,709
And you like rip a bag of chips out of somebody's hands. Okay

2548
04:57:03,110 --> 04:57:05,110
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hold on. Hold on

2549
04:57:06,790 --> 04:57:09,669
Somebody you're walking down the street. Somebody drops a bag of chips

2550
04:57:10,740 --> 04:57:14,819
And then they kind of walk away for a minute you grab the bag of chips as they're continuing to walk

2551
04:57:17,159 --> 04:57:18,840
And you take them and you eat them

2552
04:57:18,840 --> 04:57:21,830
You then the lady turns around says hey, what the hell are you doing with those chips?

2553
04:57:21,830 --> 04:57:25,270
Those are mine. I just dropped them like a minute ago. I came back to get them

2554
04:57:25,270 --> 04:57:28,709
What are you doing? You eating them and then you come in front of me. I'm the judge

2555
04:57:29,590 --> 04:57:32,950
You get arrested for that and you say it was a mistake. I'm, sorry

2556
04:57:33,270 --> 04:57:36,950
I didn't mean to do that. It was a mistake and I go. All right, you know, it was a mistake

2557
04:57:37,509 --> 04:57:45,240
That's okay. By the way, I have a bag of chips in my hand. You can just be more careful while i'm talking

2558
04:57:46,040 --> 04:57:48,040
You walk up to the podium

2559
04:57:48,040 --> 04:57:50,040
And you take the chips out of my hands

2560
04:57:50,759 --> 04:57:54,959
And you eat them in front of me and then you tell me that that was a mistake again

2561
04:57:58,119 --> 04:58:04,310
How am I supposed to believe you at that point? Worst analogy category? No, i'm just saying

2562
04:58:05,029 --> 04:58:07,189
You how do you make the same mistake twice?

2563
04:58:08,259 --> 04:58:22,000
And when they're supposed to be accidents worse and that there's no worse analogy nominee. It's not up there

2564
04:58:22,479 --> 04:58:28,819
So you good luck

2565
04:58:28,819 --> 04:58:39,750
There is no worse than allergy and I fucking forgot. Did I save it? That wasn't a joke

2566
04:58:39,750 --> 04:58:43,029
Well, how is that a joke? That was me explaining how absurd it is

2567
04:58:43,750 --> 04:58:48,470
For you to get caught doing something and then do it again and say there was a mistake again

2568
04:58:49,029 --> 04:58:55,000
How am I supposed to judge that? Is the judge gonna you know, let's say there was a judge here

2569
04:58:55,000 --> 04:58:58,279
He'd be like, I don't know about this one. That was kind of fucked up. Jeremy

2570
04:58:58,840 --> 04:59:18,159
Somebody said, you know, German it makes sense

2571
04:59:18,479 --> 04:59:32,680
Thank you. Oh, come on flip a coin

2572
04:59:33,240 --> 04:59:41,919
If I had these odds at the fucking blackjack table, I would be a trillionaire

2573
04:59:43,779 --> 04:59:45,779
No, I would lose all my money

2574
04:59:47,540 --> 04:59:49,700
Oh, that's the worst analogy in 2018

2575
04:59:50,419 --> 05:00:06,880
Fucking god, I need this shit. I'm gonna crash the game

2576
05:00:09,360 --> 05:00:12,880
Come up to me with a bag of chips and I sit there. The lady drops the chips

2577
05:00:18,229 --> 05:00:20,229
Somebody got it. I uh, whatever

2578
05:00:20,549 --> 05:00:25,029
There's no worse than allergy category. Oh my fucking god go to vegas

2579
05:00:25,990 --> 05:00:38,150
He come to me with chips in his hand

2580
05:00:44,580 --> 05:00:45,779
Yes

2581
05:00:45,779 --> 05:00:46,979
finally

2582
05:00:46,979 --> 05:00:50,659
It only took five six coin flips

2583
05:00:51,459 --> 05:00:57,330
You're in vegas right now. What the what?

2584
05:00:59,159 --> 05:01:03,040
Where the fuck am I? What where am I? I'm serious. Am I all right?

2585
05:01:03,599 --> 05:01:08,720
Uh, this is uh, I like this heart protector

2586
05:01:09,759 --> 05:01:18,659
Oops got it

2587
05:01:18,659 --> 05:01:21,520
Somebody wrote haha

2588
05:01:21,520 --> 05:01:26,319
What is going on? Who are you over here? Why are you over here?

2589
05:01:27,040 --> 05:01:30,310
Why did you sneak in here?

2590
05:01:31,799 --> 05:01:36,020
I did not tell you to do that

2591
05:01:36,020 --> 05:01:41,430
Now we both have to hide

2592
05:01:41,430 --> 05:01:43,430
Well more room, I guess

2593
05:01:44,069 --> 05:01:50,659
It's not worth taking

2594
05:01:50,659 --> 05:01:54,340
I mean it kind of is this stuff all that pretty have better armor

2595
05:01:55,299 --> 05:01:56,659
got caught

2596
05:01:56,659 --> 05:02:07,669
Can I get a list of the categories again? Absolutely you can

2597
05:02:08,310 --> 05:02:34,950
There are categories. We're not gonna get caught

2598
05:02:36,610 --> 05:02:38,610
There were more categories. No, there weren't

2599
05:02:41,779 --> 05:02:44,020
One two, three, four five six

2600
05:02:44,659 --> 05:02:50,340
Seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirty fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty. There's 20 categories

2601
05:02:52,639 --> 05:02:55,759
Where's worst analogy? It was never on the list is what you're referring to

2602
05:02:57,939 --> 05:03:01,619
Best shpe moment. Oh my god. I would know I would never put that on here

2603
05:03:02,419 --> 05:03:04,740
I'm not gonna put on best shpe moment. Okay

2604
05:03:05,700 --> 05:03:13,729
The best shpe moment. Oh my god

2605
05:03:18,610 --> 05:03:21,189
I'm still hidden

2606
05:03:21,189 --> 05:03:23,189
This thing is worth so much

2607
05:03:24,130 --> 05:03:26,130
Why is a rusty chain shirt worth?

2608
05:03:26,990 --> 05:03:31,799
2000

2609
05:03:31,799 --> 05:03:40,599
Save it. I said it 30 times this year. I I did no such thing

2610
05:03:49,299 --> 05:03:52,900
You'll put on best and worst peter, but not best shpe moment

2611
05:03:52,900 --> 05:03:56,740
You know why because peter is a relevant thing from this year

2612
05:03:57,700 --> 05:04:01,840
Shpe is a video series I made in

2613
05:04:02,619 --> 05:04:03,919
2012

2614
05:04:03,919 --> 05:04:06,930
There's nothing to do with

2615
05:04:06,990 --> 05:04:09,490
2018 new year's eve for 19

2616
05:04:12,639 --> 05:04:23,669
Let's try this again this thing's expensive get it this time

2617
05:04:24,869 --> 05:04:42,900
Are you blocking me?

2618
05:04:42,900 --> 05:04:44,919
All right. Got it

2619
05:04:44,919 --> 05:04:45,799
good

2620
05:04:45,799 --> 05:04:48,869
All right. We're almost done

2621
05:04:48,869 --> 05:04:52,479
Saved it got all the good stuff. I'm just gonna put all this equipment on

2622
05:04:53,279 --> 05:04:55,040
And then take the food

2623
05:04:55,040 --> 05:04:59,139
Got it. Okay. Nice

2624
05:04:59,139 --> 05:05:10,659
I'm going here

2625
05:05:10,659 --> 05:05:16,360
Oh two in a row

2626
05:05:16,360 --> 05:05:18,360
Take the take the categories up

2627
05:05:18,919 --> 05:05:22,630
Did somebody see it? No

2628
05:05:22,630 --> 05:05:26,599
And let me get the categories off the screen

2629
05:05:26,759 --> 05:05:29,959
so again

2630
05:05:29,959 --> 05:05:33,400
When the stream is over in just a few minutes here, that's I i'm

2631
05:05:44,950 --> 05:05:47,990
Best loud shpe moment. I can't even man

2632
05:05:50,419 --> 05:05:55,299
I need more categories. No, this is the categories that I can do in two. I gotta set this whole thing up

2633
05:05:56,549 --> 05:05:58,549
I got two days to do this

2634
05:05:58,549 --> 05:06:14,840
All right, get them off before the stream turns off. I'll make sure to show them again, but the first let me steal one more

2635
05:06:15,639 --> 05:06:17,590
thing

2636
05:06:17,590 --> 05:06:19,029
Make sure it's saved

2637
05:06:19,029 --> 05:06:24,840
Who has a higher chance to do this?

2638
05:06:24,919 --> 05:06:28,560
You do not what about frog musk? No, he's not he's too far away

2639
05:06:29,279 --> 05:06:34,020
I got an okay. Nice. You got another one

2640
05:06:34,500 --> 05:06:42,259
I think jeremy's addicted. I I think you're right

2641
05:06:42,979 --> 05:06:48,159
Did I find some weird work around here? Am I getting lucky where if you put it in your backpack, it doesn't

2642
05:06:49,119 --> 05:06:57,319
trigger an event here

2643
05:06:57,319 --> 05:07:05,009
Well, there's the answer to that question. I'm gonna leave this is supposed to be a three hour stream

2644
05:07:05,250 --> 05:07:07,889
I know i'm now i'm i'm getting out of here really really soon

2645
05:07:15,970 --> 05:07:18,529
Okay, got everything I wanted save it. Let's get out of here

2646
05:07:24,099 --> 05:07:27,700
best green screen edit, uh, there's not going to be a best green screen edit because

2647
05:07:28,500 --> 05:07:31,139
That was never supposed to be a contest in the first place

2648
05:07:31,860 --> 05:07:37,700
So i'm not going to do that

2649
05:07:37,700 --> 05:07:40,229
So i'm i'm good

2650
05:07:40,229 --> 05:07:45,029
I I do have to stop streaming though if I have any chance to get most of this done

2651
05:07:45,430 --> 05:07:48,549
It's only 8 30 here. I got some time. I got the next couple of days

2652
05:07:49,430 --> 05:07:53,139
We've got some food. We're good to go

2653
05:07:55,569 --> 05:07:57,569
Been live for about just over five hours

2654
05:08:02,389 --> 05:08:06,799
Yeah, give me some time

2655
05:08:06,799 --> 05:08:12,720
I'm gonna keep the categories on the stream. Let me just make sure that this is ready to be done

2656
05:08:14,340 --> 05:08:17,220
Are we good to open the channel?

2657
05:08:18,020 --> 05:08:33,400
Are we good? Should I am I am I good to let people be able to put um

2658
05:08:34,799 --> 05:08:39,860
Text in here

2659
05:08:39,860 --> 05:08:44,259
Holy shit. Look at all these emotes underneath the one sentence. I wrote

2660
05:08:52,709 --> 05:09:00,819
This is a weird stock market ticker go look at this look at these increasing prices

2661
05:09:01,459 --> 05:09:18,439
On these emotes in the nominees channel some of them are decreasing somehow. So let me get this back on screen

2662
05:09:20,040 --> 05:09:23,560
And again, we're going to talk about a couple more times because you're not going to see me again

2663
05:09:26,389 --> 05:09:28,560
But I do have to turn the stream off

2664
05:09:29,119 --> 05:09:31,119
To get this ready. It'll be a lot of fun

2665
05:09:31,840 --> 05:09:34,049
I'm gonna put a lot of work into it

2666
05:09:34,049 --> 05:09:36,529

For discussion that channel's not to talk about what you think if you want to talk about that

2704
05:13:14,610 --> 05:13:16,610
That channel will be called

2705
05:13:16,689 --> 05:13:18,849
Maybe nominee discussion, you know i'm saying

2706
05:13:21,959 --> 05:13:25,240

05:13:58,439 --> 05:14:01,639
I don't know how many submissions per user how many submissions per purpose. I don't know

2714
05:14:02,439 --> 05:14:06,360
Because there's a lot of categories and what if you had the things you want to nominate for?

2715
05:14:06,520 --> 05:14:09,159
Oh man one per category, but that's a lot

2716
05:14:18,630 --> 05:14:26,099
Is one per category can can that be handled do you think that's handleable over the next two days

2717
05:14:42,549 --> 05:14:44,709
Well, all right one per category

2718
05:14:47,779 --> 05:14:49,939
You have to nominate one per category

2719
05:14:53,009 --> 05:14:54,130
We can do it

05:15:15,349 --> 05:15:19,400
Uh, i'm gonna say nye

2725
05:15:20,740 --> 05:15:22,119

05:15:22,119 --> 05:15:24,439
or like

2727
05:15:24,439 --> 05:15:26,439
nominee discussion

2728
05:15:27,080 --> 05:15:30,470
I'd spell everything is so wrong how I just felt that nominee

2729
05:15:32,450 --> 05:15:40,290
Discussion you can talk in here about it. Let me go into here

2730
05:15:46,740 --> 05:15:51,599
Here we go

2731
05:15:51,599 --> 05:15:55,650
So sending you can you guys use it? Are we good?

2732
05:15:56,610 --> 05:16:07,720
Okay

2733
05:16:07,720 --> 05:16:13,479
Good if you want to talk about stuff talk about it there do not talk about it in the nominees channel only the nominees discussion channel

2734
05:16:14,279 --> 05:16:22,790
And if there's anything else I need to do

2735
05:16:24,130 --> 05:16:26,130
For I think that's good

2736
05:16:33,040 --> 05:16:35,040
Grump clump has put rules

2737
05:16:35,840 --> 05:16:37,840
in that channel

2738
05:16:38,549 --> 05:16:43,669
Go take a look

2739
05:16:43,669 --> 05:16:45,669
And make sure whatever you're doing is from

2740
05:16:46,290 --> 05:16:48,290
2018 not like

2741
05:16:48,290 --> 05:16:49,430
2016

2742
05:16:49,430 --> 05:16:51,430
It has to have happened this year

2743
05:16:51,509 --> 05:16:55,560
Is there only there's only gonna be one winner per category

2744
05:16:56,439 --> 05:17:01,400
There's gonna be like six plus nominees per category, but only one of them is going to win

2745
05:17:05,279 --> 05:17:10,880
What flavors of ice cream were invented this year? Oh boy, uh, whatever

2746
05:17:11,439 --> 05:17:12,639
It don't matter

2747
05:17:12,639 --> 05:17:19,799
Vote on discord entries with emotes or repost

2748
05:17:21,139 --> 05:17:23,380
I would say if one's already there

2749
05:17:24,180 --> 05:17:26,180
Like thumbs it up. You know what I mean?

2750
05:17:26,580 --> 05:17:30,500
Because if you if it's the exact same moment the exact same thing you're talking about

2751
05:17:30,819 --> 05:17:34,659
Just make sure that it's seen make sure that me and the mods know that a bunch of people wanted that one

2752
05:17:34,659 --> 05:17:37,270
You know what I mean?

2753
05:17:37,270 --> 05:17:40,470
If you have to put it again, then I mean we're gonna have to deal with that

2754
05:17:40,549 --> 05:17:43,029
But if you see it already because it's gonna be a lot of submissions. So

2755
05:17:43,990 --> 05:17:49,459
If you see it already try and with that have a great rest of your night. I'll see you on new year's eve

05:18:01,380 --> 05:18:05,299
It's a great fun game. It seems why I I would give it the stamp

2759
05:18:05,939 --> 05:18:08,740
Of a recommendation at this point. I would I think it's fun

2760
05:18:10,209 --> 05:18:12,610
Maybe we'll come back right to it after new years. I don't know

2761
05:18:13,330 --> 05:18:16,689
But maybe we'll take a break from it for a day come back. I I want to play it some more so

2762
05:18:17,939 --> 05:18:20,740
I'd like to make my whole community of frogs and dogs

2763
05:18:24,389 --> 05:18:28,150
But thank you shoe shrimp for the three dollars. Hey germa. Remember how I said my bird was dying

2764
05:18:28,630 --> 05:18:31,590
I went to the vet and his liver is somehow all better

2765
05:18:32,389 --> 05:18:34,389
The vet said it's nothing short of a miracle

2766
05:18:35,029 --> 05:18:39,590
Just comes to show that things always get better. Thanks for getting me through the bad moments in between

2767
05:18:40,549 --> 05:18:41,909
awesome

2768
05:18:41,909 --> 05:18:43,909
That is fantastic news

2769
05:18:51,090 --> 05:18:57,889
Really happy to hear that

2770
05:18:57,889 --> 05:19:05,919
No issues good. Thank you for the three dollars and i'm really happy to hear about the bird doing. Okay

2771
05:19:10,720 --> 05:19:14,959
Thank you divas for the three dollars again. No message from divas just always giving three dollars

2772
05:19:16,099 --> 05:19:19,700
Consistently constantly almost every I think every single stream. Thank you

2773
05:19:20,500 --> 05:19:23,509
Timmy tim tan thanks for the one dollar during the christmas eve stream

2774
05:19:23,509 --> 05:19:27,509
I saw a guy come in and say oh this guy again, and then I assume he left

2775
05:19:33,990 --> 05:19:36,310
Thank you to lorag again for 50 dollars

2776
05:19:38,689 --> 05:19:41,330
Hope yourself and everyone in chat enjoy the holiday season

2777
05:19:42,310 --> 05:19:44,610
read the message before but

2778
05:19:44,610 --> 05:19:46,610
Thank you so much lorag if you're still here

2779
05:19:48,529 --> 05:19:50,529
You are incredibly generous. Thank you

2780
05:19:50,849 --> 05:19:56,099
I really appreciate it

2781
05:19:56,099 --> 05:20:00,020
Thank you jewels for the five dollars. Hey germa. I don't know if you talked about this yet

2782
05:20:00,580 --> 05:20:04,979
But have you seen a doctor for your gluten intolerance or digestive issues? Did you receive any good advices?

2783
05:20:05,380 --> 05:20:11,380
I have the same issue. So hope you're doing well germa heart. I had a ton of tests done last week

2784
05:20:12,099 --> 05:20:14,900
And because of the holidays i'm waiting back for results on a couple of them

2785
05:20:14,900 --> 05:20:17,139
But for the most part my blood work is very normal

2786
05:20:18,259 --> 05:20:20,819
I had food allergy test. That's not back yet

2787
05:20:21,939 --> 05:20:23,540
I have

2788
05:20:23,540 --> 05:20:28,340
A couple of things that it was a breath test that I did to check for bacteria in my

2789
05:20:28,900 --> 05:20:31,060
Stomach or intestines or something. That's not back yet

2790
05:20:31,860 --> 05:20:34,180
But the general blood work was fine

2791
05:20:35,240 --> 05:20:38,599
And i'm just kind of waiting for a few things, but i'm not going to know till after new years

2792
05:20:40,340 --> 05:20:43,860
Uh, so I don't know that I don't have very much good advice for

2793
05:20:44,580 --> 05:20:47,380
Uh gluten intolerance because i'm not sure if that's what I actually have

2794
05:20:48,340 --> 05:20:51,939
I mean it would make sense if it was true, but I just don't know

2795
05:20:52,900 --> 05:20:55,220
Uh, but digestive issues I've had for a long time

2796
05:20:56,180 --> 05:20:59,880
I've had IBD for seven years now eight years

2797
05:21:00,680 --> 05:21:03,000
Almost a decade

2798
05:21:03,000 --> 05:21:05,720
And the best advice I could find is because it's so different for everybody

2799
05:21:06,599 --> 05:21:11,319
Just you got to find the things that you shouldn't be eating and just try not to eat them

2800
05:21:12,200 --> 05:21:18,360
There's a lot of foods that just randomly trigger IBD symptoms and they're different for everybody

2801
05:21:19,240 --> 05:21:22,369
Try to substitute those things

2802
05:21:22,900 --> 05:21:25,540
I got breathalyzed at the doctors. No, it was a

2803
05:21:27,270 --> 05:21:29,270
It was a Healabac to pylori test

2804
05:21:29,750 --> 05:21:31,750
and then I did another one which was

2805
05:21:32,229 --> 05:21:33,990
a like sucrose

2806
05:21:33,990 --> 05:21:35,189
breath thing

2807
05:21:35,189 --> 05:21:36,549
Whatever it was

2808
05:21:36,549 --> 05:21:38,790
I didn't get breathalyzed at the doctors

2809
05:21:47,159 --> 05:21:49,159
Vinny's playing mother three. See ya

2810
05:21:50,290 --> 05:21:52,770
Well, thanks for coming. I'm sure that'll be a fun time

2811
05:21:53,409 --> 05:22:03,189
Sure, that's gonna be pretty interesting. So what happens when I drink too much wine? No

2812
05:22:03,909 --> 05:22:07,669
But take care of yourself jules. Hopefully you can figure it out

2813
05:22:08,770 --> 05:22:10,770
trying to figure out medical problems is

2814
05:22:11,889 --> 05:22:17,009
It's the worst thing ever because it could just be anything. I've had this weird back and stomach pain for

2815
05:22:17,650 --> 05:22:22,130
Seven months. I've no idea what it is. I've absolutely no idea. I might just be getting old

2816
05:22:22,529 --> 05:22:26,770
Is this a symptom? Is this something is this is nothing actually wrong with me? Am I just fucking old? I don't know

2817
05:22:29,319 --> 05:22:33,060
I don't know

2818
05:22:33,060 --> 05:22:36,740
We'll find out soon enough. But thank you. Thank you the whole keg for the five dollars

2819
05:22:36,740 --> 05:22:38,740
We're just spreading belated christmas cheer

2820
05:22:39,619 --> 05:22:42,819
Yes, this game is great for your kind of streams

2821
05:22:45,299 --> 05:22:49,860
Yeah, I like just kind of hanging out but sometimes it don't have to be crazy. You know what I mean?

2822
05:22:50,500 --> 05:22:52,500
there are some moments in this game that can be but

2823
05:22:53,700 --> 05:22:59,060
it's fun sometimes to sit there for five to eight hours and mine stones and just chat and hang out and

2824
05:23:00,580 --> 05:23:02,790
You know what I mean?

2825
05:23:02,790 --> 05:23:09,319
It's a great game for that

2826
05:23:09,319 --> 05:23:12,119
But thank you the whole keg for the five dollars

2827
05:23:14,720 --> 05:23:18,240
Hey another huge thank you to all the gifted community subs

2828
05:23:20,200 --> 05:23:22,759
tora t comes to mind here with

2829
05:23:23,380 --> 05:23:26,020
50

2830
05:23:26,020 --> 05:23:27,540
right here

2831
05:23:27,540 --> 05:23:29,139
That's so much

2832
05:23:29,139 --> 05:23:31,380
That's a lot of subs to give in one second

2833
05:23:32,099 --> 05:23:37,919
And I think there was even more after that too

2834
05:23:40,000 --> 05:23:43,430
my god

2835
05:23:43,430 --> 05:23:48,790
So many community subs and then 420 squid. Thanks for the one dollar. Spyro music is the key to subs

2836
05:23:51,569 --> 05:23:54,770
I did play the Spyro 2 ost at least a portion of it

2837
05:23:56,130 --> 05:23:57,970
But thank you

2838
05:23:57,970 --> 05:24:01,569
Thank you the yellowest for the one dollar can't stay around but i'll see you in the vod boy

2839
05:24:02,369 --> 05:24:05,009
Always remember your time and effort are appreciated here

2840
05:24:08,240 --> 05:24:09,279
Thank you

2841
05:24:09,279 --> 05:24:14,439
Hopefully if you catch this or if you see the new year's eve stream, hopefully we catch you there

2842
05:24:14,439 --> 05:24:16,439
That should be a really really fun night

2843
05:24:17,000 --> 05:24:19,080
Even that stream is probably only going to be a few hours

2844
05:24:19,799 --> 05:24:22,799
I'll probably do like a pre-stream thing maybe before

2845
05:24:24,000 --> 05:24:27,479
But it'll be like a little three hour event

2846
05:24:28,439 --> 05:24:31,959
And it should be a lot of fun

2847
05:24:36,259 --> 05:24:42,180
Thank you to smelly boy for the one dollar save before risky decisions. I did I did I've saved quick saved like a thousand times

2848
05:24:44,580 --> 05:24:48,580
420 squared. Thanks for the four dollars call of duty round start compilation

2849
05:24:50,740 --> 05:25:01,860
What call of duty round start compilation? I don't know what that means

2850
05:25:03,509 --> 05:25:05,509
Is that am I missing something?

2851
05:25:14,979 --> 05:25:19,689
He doesn't get it call of duty round start compilation

2852
05:25:20,409 --> 05:25:30,819
Can fail, I don't know. Oh, thank you for the four dollars 420 squid

2853
05:25:31,860 --> 05:25:35,220
E dragon. Thanks for the two bucks. Thanks for the spiral ost. Wish I could give you more

2854
05:25:35,220 --> 05:25:38,580
But this is all I have for now. Don't worry about giving me money. Thank you for even attempting

2855
05:25:38,580 --> 05:25:43,779
Thanks for even a dollar. Thanks for even a cent. Thank you for two dollars. Thank you

2856
05:25:45,060 --> 05:25:46,889
Appreciate it

2857

It's time for slime. Thanks for the one dollar. Welcome back time for slime spiral ost appreciation bits

2858
05:25:53,689 --> 05:26:04,630
Maybe you wanted me to look it up

2859
05:26:05,509 --> 05:26:08,229
Garfield the Monday killer. Thanks for the one dollar you

2860
05:26:09,110 --> 05:26:12,229
Right there in the back. Come on down. What's your name, sir? German on eight five

2861
05:26:12,709 --> 05:26:17,029
Well, congratulations. German because you're on america's favorite game show spider. No, that was a lie

2862
05:26:17,990 --> 05:26:20,310
Say it with me folks garf or no garf

2863
05:26:22,180 --> 05:26:23,540
Now the rules of the game are simple

2864
05:26:23,540 --> 05:26:26,900
Just look at the screen up there and tell me if it's garfield or not garfield. Are you ready?

2865
05:26:27,380 --> 05:26:30,259
Look closely. Is it garfield or no focus now?

2866
05:26:31,220 --> 05:26:33,220
There's no there's no garfield on the screen

2867
05:26:35,590 --> 05:26:36,869
Did I win?

2868
05:26:36,869 --> 05:26:39,189
Correct now tell arlene

2869
05:26:40,330 --> 05:26:45,130
Tell him what he won. That's right. One whole garf buck. I can't believe it folks. See you next stream

2870
05:26:50,419 --> 05:26:54,150
Thank you garfield

2871
05:26:54,150 --> 05:26:56,490
Magical rodent. Thanks for the one dollar. It's good to see you streaming

2872
05:26:56,490 --> 05:27:01,770
I've had a really rough day today with my grandfather dying on my birthday as always these streams get me through the day

2873
05:27:01,770 --> 05:27:03,770
I'm really really sorry to hear that

2874
05:27:09,860 --> 05:27:15,380
Happy birthday. I'm sorry for your loss. That's terrible

2875
05:27:24,569 --> 05:27:26,169
Thanks for hanging out

2876
05:27:26,169 --> 05:27:28,169
Hopefully you feel better. It's tough

2877
05:27:29,110 --> 05:27:30,869
Much love to you. Thank you

2878
05:27:30,869 --> 05:27:42,279
Happy birthday magical rodent sir feline. Thanks for the one dollar. Why wasn't the rat song?

2879
05:27:43,000 --> 05:27:45,000
Even considered during the music part

2880
05:27:45,560 --> 05:27:51,639
This is an outrage

2881
05:27:51,639 --> 05:28:02,020
Um, what do you mean for the osts? It's like one song

2882
05:28:02,819 --> 05:28:05,380
It'd be on repeat

2883
05:28:05,380 --> 05:28:14,169
Well, that's the point

2884
05:28:14,169 --> 05:28:16,630
Oh, I see

2885
05:28:16,630 --> 05:28:19,349
Uh, hey g flota. Thanks for the five dollars

2886
05:28:19,909 --> 05:28:25,270
Hey, could you put on the kenshi ost? I got a feeling you'd like it. The game's ambience is similar to this one's thanks

2887
05:28:25,750 --> 05:28:35,500
It would be fun if I did that. Uh, thank you garon ninja for the one dollar germa heart. Thank you

2888
05:28:39,750 --> 05:28:42,950
Thank you nipple for the one dollar. Yo, yo, it's my guy

Thank you for the dollar c4g. Thanks for the one dollar

2892
05:28:55,419 --> 05:28:57,419
Uh, they just say bisexual pride

2893
05:28:57,979 --> 05:29:01,259
Thanks for the one dollar

2894
05:29:01,259 --> 05:29:11,240
Let's see, you know, let's see it in the chat right now

Thank you so much

2896
05:29:20,779 --> 05:29:26,939
Captain worgen. Thanks for the one dollar follow your dreams germa. Don't cave into peer pressure like all the other kids on the playground

2897
05:29:27,740 --> 05:29:29,099
Well, it's hard

2898
05:29:29,099 --> 05:29:31,419
When you're one kid on the playground and there are

2899
05:29:32,680 --> 05:29:35,740
5,000 other kids on the playground all throwing rocks at you

2900
05:29:39,080 --> 05:29:49,450
Right, you know, I mean when there are 5 000 kids on the playground all screaming at the same time

2901
05:29:57,619 --> 05:30:00,180
Comment on the right side of your screen equals

2902
05:30:00,979 --> 05:30:05,750
rock

2903
05:30:05,750 --> 05:30:15,590
Yeah, that was that was way overkill. Huh? That was way overblown. That's not even close

2904
05:30:25,799 --> 05:30:29,319
That was great, but what was that person's name? Oh, that was good

2905
05:30:30,439 --> 05:30:33,669
Remember that person

2906
05:30:33,669 --> 05:30:35,580
But yeah

2907
05:30:35,580 --> 05:30:45,369
Thank you. Thank you captain worgen. Thank you dark star 700,000 games the one dollar. Hey, man

2908
05:30:46,090 --> 05:30:48,650
I want to say sorry about my bits message yesterday at the time

2909
05:30:48,650 --> 05:30:52,250
I thought this was this game was just some poorly made piece of junk

2910
05:30:52,810 --> 05:30:57,610
That vinnie would play on a sunday trash stream, but I am actually quite enjoying this game now

2911
05:30:59,509 --> 05:31:01,509
Sometimes you got to give them a chance

2912
05:31:03,689 --> 05:31:06,569
You'll know if I think a game is just not worth playing. You'll know it

2913
05:31:07,369 --> 05:31:11,049
We've started and stopped

2914
05:31:11,049 --> 05:31:13,049
to shit terrible games

2915
05:31:13,610 --> 05:31:17,349
In three hours before

2916
05:31:17,349 --> 05:31:20,069
I think there's something here. I think there's something fun here

2917
05:31:23,860 --> 05:31:25,220
and I

2918
05:31:25,220 --> 05:31:27,060
I think we're close

2919
05:31:27,060 --> 05:31:28,580
to seeing it

2920
05:31:28,580 --> 05:31:32,419
It's already been very interesting and very fun so far just weird and

2921
05:31:33,139 --> 05:31:35,580
elaborate things happening

2922
05:31:36,299 --> 05:31:38,729
But you can build whole towns

2923
05:31:38,970 --> 05:31:42,040
This whole area is a map that have not been seen

2924
05:31:43,400 --> 05:31:51,209
It seems really interesting and

2925
05:31:52,020 --> 05:31:54,229
For the price that it is

2926
05:31:54,229 --> 05:31:56,229
I can't really complain, you know

2927
05:31:56,470 --> 05:32:00,279
this is not

2928
05:32:00,279 --> 05:32:02,279
a 60 game

2929
05:32:03,909 --> 05:32:06,790
Currently it is I believe it was a 20 30 bucks

2930
05:32:07,750 --> 05:32:09,750
It's 29.99 for this game

2931
05:32:15,130 --> 05:32:18,069
So it's kind of like

2932
05:32:18,950 --> 05:32:22,659
It's a little rough around the edges, right? It is

2933
05:32:23,380 --> 05:32:25,380
But I think that adds something to it

2934
05:32:26,020 --> 05:32:34,139
Derma is like 10% of the game at the moment in the newbie town

2935
05:32:35,369 --> 05:32:37,369
Yeah

2936
05:32:37,930 --> 05:32:42,810
I'd buy it if it was 30. It is 30. It's 29.99

2937
05:32:51,590 --> 05:32:53,590
One cent off

2938
05:32:55,099 --> 05:32:57,580
It has to be exactly 30 or I don't want it

2939
05:32:58,380 --> 05:33:00,380
Oh, well, sorry

2940
05:33:05,880 --> 05:33:08,279
But it's it's like whatever you want to make it if you can

2941
05:33:08,840 --> 05:33:11,880
If you want to like role play as certain characters if you wanted to make

2942
05:33:12,360 --> 05:33:15,479
There's a bunch of starting characters. You can just pick from and screw around with

2943
05:33:16,919 --> 05:33:21,720
If you talk like pound for pound just how much time we'll just look at the time i've spent in the game so far

2944
05:33:23,290 --> 05:33:25,209
I have what?

2945
05:33:25,209 --> 05:33:27,849
15 hours in the game 14 hours in the game something like that

2946
05:33:29,849 --> 05:33:31,130
and

2947
05:33:31,130 --> 05:33:35,610
Some games guys that are 60 dollars. I spend four hours in and I go this was terrible

2948
05:33:36,169 --> 05:33:38,169
Or uh, this was all right

2949
05:33:38,810 --> 05:33:49,099
so

2950
05:33:49,099 --> 05:33:52,549
I mean, but it you know games like this are not really for everybody

2951
05:33:53,270 --> 05:33:57,740
Because they kind of just don't you don't get to do anything really at the start

2952
05:33:58,619 --> 05:34:00,700
the whole point of this entire game is

2953
05:34:01,819 --> 05:34:04,540
You have to start from nothing. You're gonna lose every fight

2954
05:34:05,340 --> 05:34:07,340
And it's a little rough

2955
05:34:07,500 --> 05:34:09,500
around the edges, it's a little

2956
05:34:09,900 --> 05:34:11,979
wonky, but

2957
05:34:11,979 --> 05:34:14,220
You just have to play it and just see how far you get

2958
05:34:15,020 --> 05:34:17,959
Oh, you're very forced into mining

2959
05:34:20,180 --> 05:34:23,700
maybe you are but

2960
05:34:23,700 --> 05:34:32,650
You know, i'll look into it. You're right the evil within two if I could put a worst game of 2018 up there

2961
05:34:32,970 --> 05:34:34,970
When did evil within two come out?

2962
05:34:37,240 --> 05:34:40,380
That came out this year, didn't it?

2963
05:34:40,380 --> 05:34:41,849
damn it

2964
05:34:41,849 --> 05:34:43,849
I would have just given it to

2965
05:34:44,700 --> 05:34:46,939
Evil within two if it was 2018

2966
05:34:47,580 --> 05:34:51,509
And it goes last year

2967
05:34:51,509 --> 05:34:54,790
I wouldn't even have like a category of nomination. I would just give worst game of the year to it

2968
05:34:55,430 --> 05:35:02,040
Are you gonna tell me that you thought that game was worse than the quiet man? Yes

2969
05:35:02,840 --> 05:35:06,869
because the quiet man was made on probably like a

2970
05:35:07,830 --> 05:35:13,189
Four million dollar budget and evil within two was probably like 60 to 150 million dollars

2971
05:35:13,990 --> 05:35:26,580
That's so much

2972
05:35:28,419 --> 05:35:31,700
You may give up numbers out of bias i'm just kidding

2973
05:35:32,740 --> 05:35:36,169
The evil within two was an awful game

2974
05:35:37,819 --> 05:35:43,259
It was the worst game to come out in the last 50 years and i'm talking i'm talking when the tron video game came

2975
05:35:43,259 --> 05:35:45,259
out for regular nintendo

2976
05:35:46,020 --> 05:35:48,020
That's how far back you have to go

2977
05:35:48,259 --> 05:36:00,680
I respect i'm fucking around guys

2978
05:36:03,819 --> 05:36:08,700
I'm actually just kidding around. Don't worry. Nobody go but well, i've really liked evil within two. Why is he doing this?

2979
05:36:11,540 --> 05:36:21,209
Just kidding. It's a joke. He did truly hate the game though. No, it was a 2017 wasn't even the same year

2980
05:36:21,209 --> 05:36:23,209
It doesn't even count anymore

2981
05:36:29,529 --> 05:36:30,810
anyways

2982
05:36:30,889 --> 05:36:36,490
Uh, yes, kenshi is I would give it. Yes, I don't give like letter grades. I don't say well, that's like a no

2983
05:36:36,569 --> 05:36:38,090
Just there's a stamp

2984
05:36:38,090 --> 05:36:40,250
It's worth playing it is it is worth

2985
05:36:41,029 --> 05:36:43,529
Purchasing you could probably have some fun in it

2986
05:36:44,490 --> 05:36:46,490
That's kind of how I judge any game. I play

2987
05:36:46,810 --> 05:36:50,569
Hey flim flam. Thanks for the ten dollars worth every cat. Thanks for ten bucks

2988
05:36:51,450 --> 05:37:03,400
Worth every cat. Thank you so much for the ten dollars blim flam. Thank you

2989
05:37:04,119 --> 05:37:08,840
To neon five eight twelve for the one dollar category worst german nine eight five creations

2990
05:37:09,560 --> 05:37:13,610
I mean the thing that that's worst new character. I think

2991
05:37:14,330 --> 05:37:17,659
Pits in that category

2992
05:37:17,659 --> 05:37:19,659
You give letter grades all the time

2993
05:37:21,000 --> 05:37:24,040
Back up us back in like 2017. I did that we're talking about 2018

2994
05:37:24,759 --> 05:37:28,389
Which is a different year

2995
05:37:28,389 --> 05:37:31,270
Uh neon again, thanks with three dollars have the wasps returned

2996
05:37:31,990 --> 05:37:37,540
What's that buzzing?

2997
05:37:37,540 --> 05:37:39,540
Is the bird house a character?

2998
05:37:39,860 --> 05:37:44,259
No, the bird house would be that would be classified as a stream

2999
05:37:45,060 --> 05:37:52,470
Right. That's an overall stream

3000
05:37:52,470 --> 05:37:54,470
Why are they more worse than bests?

3001
05:37:55,400 --> 05:37:58,200
That's I guess kind of the point of the whole stream

3002
05:38:07,110 --> 05:38:08,549
Thank you neon

3003
05:38:08,549 --> 05:38:12,869
Hey dark star. Thanks again for the dollar amen. He's doing the end of p voice germa pluto

05:38:24,220 --> 05:38:26,619
But the last joke you made was minus two

3008
05:38:27,500 --> 05:38:29,500
This was two hours ago. I don't know what I did

3009
05:38:30,060 --> 05:38:35,900
But uh, even the best baseball players in the world that have ever lived, uh still

3010
05:38:37,349 --> 05:38:39,349
Failed seven out of ten times

3011
05:38:39,990 --> 05:38:41,349
so

3012
05:38:41,349 --> 05:38:42,630

Come on. Hey binary man zero one one zero one zero. Hey, thanks binary man for the one dollar

3014

A category for the new year's eve stream should be loudest. Oh god. It's so loud moment of 2018

3015
05:39:05,110 --> 05:39:08,279
I don't think there are very many of those this year

3016
05:39:20,569 --> 05:39:24,970
It happens often, but I don't know if that happened if there's any been really crazy ones a couple of years ago

3017
05:39:25,689 --> 05:39:30,729
Back when I didn't understand how to properly configure obs and stream decks and stuff

3018
05:39:30,810 --> 05:39:33,849
Maybe happened a lot more frequently. Sometimes I still can't catch it

3019
05:39:35,299 --> 05:39:38,340
But no, this is the list that's 20 categories

3020
05:39:39,060 --> 05:39:41,060
That'll take us a few hours to get through

3021
05:39:43,319 --> 05:39:46,200
Hey super sale. Thanks for the one dollar. No message. Just thank you

3022

Thank you so much walnut for the ten bucks

3025
05:39:56,889 --> 05:40:01,849
but i'm not going to do a green screen category because that was not supposed to be a contest

3026
05:40:03,909 --> 05:40:06,229
And making a best and worst green screen

3027
05:40:07,430 --> 05:40:09,189
Makes it a contest

3028
05:40:09,189 --> 05:40:12,979
There were so many great submissions. I would not want to just be like yours was the best

3029
05:40:13,060 --> 05:40:16,099
No, that wasn't the intent of that whole entire project

3030
05:40:16,819 --> 05:40:18,819
And i'm not going to make that the intent

3031
05:40:19,299 --> 05:40:26,599
But thank you for the five dollars here best green screen you son of a bitch

There was the hold fast streams. There was the mmo

05:41:06,639 --> 05:41:09,360
Stream where we played like three or four of them

3039
05:41:10,240 --> 05:41:14,759
There hasn't been very many there would only be about three nominees anyways

3040
05:41:17,150 --> 05:41:20,430
And balloons tower defense five would win. They just would

3041
05:41:21,310 --> 05:41:24,029
So congratulations to balloons tower defense five

3042
05:41:24,750 --> 05:41:26,990
For winning in that category that's not on the screen

3043
05:41:27,869 --> 05:41:29,310

Billy who sometimes misses the c and control c. Well, I would ask

3052
05:42:02,669 --> 05:42:04,669
spork why why are you

3053
05:42:05,229 --> 05:42:06,509
copying

3054
05:42:06,509 --> 05:42:08,270
and pasting

3055
05:42:08,270 --> 05:42:10,750
All these pornographic pieces of material

3056
05:42:13,240 --> 05:42:17,080
I je why do you need to do that? It's not it's it's unnecessary

3057
05:42:18,200 --> 05:42:28,909
Did he do it again? Did it? Yeah, he did. He did it again

3058
05:42:40,349 --> 05:42:42,439
this

3059
05:42:42,439 --> 05:42:46,279
I might have to just like put a cooldown on links for now

3060
05:42:47,080 --> 05:42:49,900
Maybe that'll be a 2019

3061
05:42:49,959 --> 05:42:51,740
improvement

3062
05:42:51,740 --> 05:42:56,139
Although i'm not sure it's an improvement because I don't want to do that. You know what I mean? I don't want to have to do that

3063
05:42:57,259 --> 05:42:59,259
Don't make me have to do that

How long do you think you would last in a fight with a gorilla the gorilla knows wrestling?

3092
05:45:00,200 --> 05:45:02,759
I would lose I would I would be dead in about one second

3093
05:45:03,240 --> 05:45:07,159
The gorilla would just double-handed just grab me and smash me into the ground. I would die instantly

3094
05:45:07,159 --> 05:45:09,159
So not even two seconds. I don't think

3095
05:45:14,220 --> 05:45:15,740

3101
05:45:52,919 --> 05:45:54,919
Sippy cup should just be the default cup

3102
05:45:55,639 --> 05:46:01,919
It's a gnome. That's a gnome

3103
05:46:02,240 --> 05:46:07,400
You know, I don't want to click it out on but i'm gonna i'm not gonna gnome you guys. Why would I do that?

3106
05:46:20,799 --> 05:46:24,400
Thank you clueless sniper for the one dollar. You should make a fake clip for one of the categories

3107
05:46:27,790 --> 05:46:32,919
I already

3108
05:46:32,919 --> 05:46:36,439
I can't just throw in fake shit again. Like I did that last week

3109
05:46:37,689 --> 05:46:40,330
Just throw in fake stuff. That's not there

3110
05:46:47,930 --> 05:46:50,569
Just one may we'll see it depends on how

3111
05:46:51,209 --> 05:46:54,490
How long this takes me to make these categories in the videos for them?

3112
05:46:58,619 --> 05:47:05,580

05:47:22,700 --> 05:47:26,779
Uh, i've never heard of a twitch streamer giving his fans free money

3118
05:47:27,580 --> 05:47:31,099
But between your own generosity and your supportive community, you're making it happen

3119
05:47:31,819 --> 05:47:37,340
Just don't feel obligated to give me money. Okay, it's not about the bits. Here's the 2019 being an even crazier year

3120
05:47:38,139 --> 05:47:41,259

Really appreciate it

3163
05:50:55,770 --> 05:50:58,909
And no, that's not even true

3164
05:50:58,909 --> 05:51:00,909
There's a link here from double d

3165
05:51:01,150 --> 05:51:04,270
And no, we just came in with three dollars 33 cents right now. Thank you. No, b

3166
05:51:05,069 --> 05:51:08,299
No message. Thank you

3167
05:51:08,299 --> 05:51:10,299
Let's go ahead and throw up the credits

3168
05:51:12,650 --> 05:51:15,439
Because there are going to be a lot

3169
05:51:15,439 --> 05:51:17,689
I mean a lot

3170
05:51:17,689 --> 05:51:20,029
A very large amount of subscriptions

3171
05:51:22,619 --> 05:51:24,380
Thank you so much everybody

3172
05:51:24,380 --> 05:51:27,580
While these go up the screen in a weird

3173
05:51:28,299 --> 05:51:29,580
fashion

3174
05:51:29,580 --> 05:51:33,040
I want to break down one more time

3175
05:51:34,590 --> 05:51:36,590
It was not a gnome. It was this

3176
05:51:41,840 --> 05:51:44,139
Uh, let me break down one more time

3177
05:51:44,139 --> 05:51:46,860
See you on new year's eve at around seven o'clock pacific

3178
05:51:54,909 --> 05:51:56,909
I will not be live until then

3179
05:51:57,880 --> 05:51:59,959
So take the opportunity to figure out

3180
05:52:00,439 --> 05:52:02,200
From the categories on here

3181
05:52:02,200 --> 05:52:05,479
You get to pick one nomination per category per person

3182
05:52:06,200 --> 05:52:10,279
So that means you could put up to 20 but it has to be on one category

3183
05:52:10,919 --> 05:52:13,799
You can't just put you know, 20 different worst

3184
05:52:14,360 --> 05:52:18,119
Gamer moments you can pick one but you can do it for all of them

3185
05:52:23,529 --> 05:52:25,930
These nominations will be picked by me

3186
05:52:26,889 --> 05:52:28,889
And a handful of the mods

3187
05:52:31,279 --> 05:52:32,880
a day from now

3188
05:52:32,880 --> 05:52:35,049
Pretty much one day from now

3189
05:52:36,299 --> 05:52:41,259
Maybe even tomorrow afternoon there's going to be another link there that will be a poll to vote

3190
05:52:44,889 --> 05:52:52,540
For the winners of those categories which will then be put into an envelope and opened on stream

3191
05:52:53,020 --> 05:53:00,200
The poll is not there yet. We need to have the nominations first

3192
05:53:02,860 --> 05:53:06,939
You'll see the disc it'll be in a discord. There'll be just just jump in the discord over the next

3193
05:53:07,500 --> 05:53:10,700
24 hours or so. You'll see it. You're just gonna have to click a link

3194
05:53:11,419 --> 05:53:17,720
The link will be in the discord. It will take you to a survey which you will take it'll be

3195
05:53:18,439 --> 05:53:30,880
Every nominee you just got to vote for them get someone else to make the envelope. So you're surprised

3196
05:53:31,689 --> 05:53:33,689
Um, that's probably what i'll do

3197
05:53:37,919 --> 05:53:41,599
Look at all these subs look at all these subs coming in right now. That's insane

3198
05:53:45,979 --> 05:53:48,189
So i'll see you on new year's eve

3199
05:53:48,189 --> 05:53:51,069
I'm gonna be in the discord for the next couple of days

3200
05:53:53,500 --> 05:53:58,860
Lurking checking some stuff out talking to the mods getting stuff prepared because i'm not i'm not going anywhere

3201
05:53:58,860 --> 05:54:00,860
i'm gonna be sitting here doing working on this so

3202
05:54:03,959 --> 05:54:12,299
Much love to everybody

3203
05:54:12,299 --> 05:54:22,009
How many subs were tonight let me see I think it was like 300 at least two to 300

3204
05:54:23,799 --> 05:54:25,479
Jesus

3205
05:54:25,479 --> 05:54:28,520
Thank you everybody so much. I hope you're enjoying the kenshi streams

3206
05:54:29,240 --> 05:54:33,069
They're a little bit more relaxed and just chilled than some of the other ones

3207
05:54:36,650 --> 05:54:41,180
Wait, what's playing?

3208
05:54:41,180 --> 05:54:43,180
My god, look at this. Something else is playing

3209
05:54:45,900 --> 05:54:47,900
What is playing now, oh

3210
05:54:49,020 --> 05:54:51,020
Okay

3211
05:54:51,979 --> 05:54:53,979
It's auto played

3212
05:54:56,720 --> 05:55:03,680
All right, good night everybody see you new year's eve get your nominations in follow the rules see you soon
