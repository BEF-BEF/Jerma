1
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:16,390
Hey, please can you do another dot to dot stream? Oh, yeah, that was kind of fun.

2
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:29,289
That was a fun day. What's up? How you doing? You're late, Mr. Yeah, but you know what,

3
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:38,759
let's go. Let's talk about this. No streamers on time ever. This is a streamer issue. It's not

4
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:46,890
even a me issue. It's a streamer issue. It's just like, we all kind of just like things kind of,

5
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,850
you know, there's a lot going on right before we got to get ready. This streamer, it's us streamers

6
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:58,119
do this stuff. You know, there's tons of people that stream on time. That's excuses. You're the

7
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:18,120
problem. Nice copium. I'm at work right now. Well, be careful and you should just I don't want to

8
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:25,060
get you in trouble. Anyways, how are you? Merry Christmas. Happy holidays. Happy New Year. Let

9
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:32,950
me say all those because after today, you are not going to see me until after the New Year.

10
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:41,769
I was thinking about just not streaming and just kind of going on break and coming back in the

11
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:48,359
new year, but I feel that was kind of too long. Like two and a half weeks or something. No.

12
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:54,099
So I have some time and I have a lot of random stuff from the Christmas show.

13
00:01:54,739 --> 00:02:06,359
So that was a wild day. A lot of people were a little confused, but you know, dude, you're muted.

14
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,159
How would I be muted if you have I'm reading comments of things I'm saying?

15
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:18,710
Yeah, that was a lot of moving parts. A lot of stuff happening on that show,

16
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:27,139
which I've wanted to do this show for about two years and just trying to find the right time

17
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,659
to. All right, we're going to go through that. All right, I want to go through that now.

18
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:43,800
Like bread and bread. What the hell is that? Dude, why is my P green? I don't why are you asking me

19
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,479
that? That's something you should you should go to urgent care and ask that question.

20
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:59,849
I don't have an answer for you. I don't know. Your P is like bright green.

21
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:10,599
I don't I don't know what that means. Answer him. I just did. I don't know. I'm not a doctor.

22
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:19,659
Did you plan to pour the coffee out with a truck beforehand? All right. Well, there's a lot to go

23
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:25,030
over. And I know a lot of people have a lot of questions. So we can just start from the beginning.

24
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:31,219
I got my throat so froggy right now. I guess I have been talking a lot.

25
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:43,590
Who? How was Santa? Who was Santa? Santa. All right. Give me a moment. Let me clear my throat.

26
00:03:50,569 --> 00:04:03,050
When was Santa? Did you film the whole Christmas song? All right. So let's start. Let's start at

27
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:09,189
the very beginning. This stream had its inception about two to three years ago. I was trying to

28
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:15,780
find a way to do this, trying to find a way to make it so I would have this big event that just

29
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:22,839
would get ruined. And I feel like this was a good time to do it. It was from November 2020 based on

30
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:29,430
chat logs. That's another thing I was a little concerned about years ago. You know how sometimes

31
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:35,829
I just am in the chat, either an offline chat or post stream, pre stream. And I just kind of say

32
00:04:35,829 --> 00:04:45,189
shit. Yeah, there are receipts. People link. Don't don't tell me no. And you don't know what I mean.

33
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,470
The amount of times that I've been linked the hamster stream, because I just write stuff in

34
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:57,910
pre stream. I just write stuff and whatever. Do I do it or do I not do it? So a long time ago,

35
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:03,750
I wrote this exact stream joke into the chat saying, oh, yeah, I was thinking about doing that.

36
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:09,829
Maybe it's funny. I don't know. And I finally did it. Obviously, a lot more elaborate than two or

37
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:15,240
three sentences in a chat room. But, you know, please, please, please do the hamster stream.

38
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:24,250
I don't think people would like the hamster stream. I really think people would have,

39
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:37,480
would be very, very uncomfortable with that. I would be uncomfortable with that. All right.

40
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,490
But yeah, this is something I've wanted to do for a long time. But I want to do it in a way,

41
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:47,750
too, that wasn't, you know, I know the first 10 minutes of the 15 minutes of that stream was

42
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:56,379
kind of fucked up. But I also didn't want to just kind of ruin the award show, because there was the

43
00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:03,319
idea of how long should I do this for? How long does this start for? And I think after because

44
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,160
honestly, those first five to seven categories were dogshit categories. That was it was intentional

45
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:15,579
to be there. People were like, dude, why is worse Peter still on the list? Well, it was to buy us

46
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:24,920
time to do the real awards. If you would like to know a few of those early awards were just to make

47
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:30,490
sure that I could do the real ones on the main channel. Dude, why is worse? These these nominees

48
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,970
for worse Peter are terrible. This category is awful. Why is it even still here? Well, now you

49
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:44,680
know. It was filler. It was. I remember getting okay, we're getting a little ahead of ourselves

50
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:52,170
here. But I remember getting to the point where I think a lot of you thought that that was what it

51
00:06:52,170 --> 00:07:00,519
was going to be the whole stream. We got about six, seven awards in. And the extinguisher was just on

52
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:06,199
the main channel. And I think a lot of people were like, I don't like this. What are you doing? No,

53
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:11,720
stop this. This I don't want to see this anymore. Please don't doll. I was looking forward to the

54
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:20,819
awards ruining Christmas. I saw the coffee pasta. I'm like, oh shit, people are like actually getting

55
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:33,750
sad. And then there was the reverse coffee pasta, which was fun, too. Yeah, that was funny. But yeah,

56
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:41,459
I wanted to make sure that we did the routine. And then okay, we're now we're just gonna do the

57
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:45,459
awards and we're gonna chill out. It's gonna be a fun cozy stream for the last hour or two,

58
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:53,160
whatever it was, right. So that's why I played out that way. Did you actually randomly mod people?

59
00:07:53,160 --> 00:08:02,819
Well, how about this? No. Hey, hey, hey, the mods were in on it the whole time. The mods were in on

60
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:16,920
it the whole freaking time. No way. It was a fun stream. It was definitely it was definitely fun.

61
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:22,519
I would say that was probably I was a I was very concerned about this stream because there's a lot

62
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:29,639
of moving parts. I'm actually more so than maybe a lot of people think trying to do a stream where

63
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:36,120
you fight another stream at the same time and need to converge the two timelines together

64
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:45,029
with delays and, you know, live transcoding delays to each other. And it was very wait,

65
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:53,850
so it was a joke. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, of course not. Was it actually live? Yeah,

66
00:08:53,850 --> 00:09:01,139
the whole thing was live. There's only one thing that wasn't live. And it's this guy.

67
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:12,730
This is the only thing that wasn't live. Yeah, there is. Is he okay? Bugleberry is okay.

68
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:19,700
Confirmed we had a conversation over the phone. I was very concerned, but no, he said he said he

69
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:27,179
was completely fine. He said he had a little bit of a he said his shoulder or his back kind of

70
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:36,299
hurt a little, but he'll be all right. How did he get out? I don't that's another question for

71
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:44,230
another day. I don't know. But yeah, let me put this in. So I want to ask you. Hi. Yes, I'm here.

72
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:53,480
I want to ask, do you do you guys want to watch the Bugleberry segment just without anything?

73
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,820
You can see like how that played out. You want to start there? Because one of the hardest things

74
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:09,909
of this whole entire stream was that and trying to work with Bugleberry. Somebody just went, nah,

75
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:18,149
not really. All right, let's let's actually let's watch it because it cut away a few times. And I

76
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:23,029
think during this portion is when we were mixing the streams together. So people were going to go

77
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:26,789
on all over the place. There was a lot of chaos. There was a lot of screaming. So do you want to

78
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:33,830
just kind of see how this actually played out? It was dim the lights. So this is this is the

79
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:39,269
actual segment. We can skip through it. We don't have to watch the entire thing. I just want to

80
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:44,009
say there's a few places that I just need to be seen because of how awesome I thought it was.

81
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:54,710
And the the BTS crew, the on the summit. Oh, they absolutely destroyed this. They killed it. It was

82
00:10:54,710 --> 00:11:03,019
awesome. So anytime that I write up stuff, yeah, be on the summit. Beyond the Summit was the

83
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:10,019
production crew for the show. And it's the group that did all the camera work, all the set designing

84
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:19,350
and all that stuff. So they did an unbelievable stellar job. So but when you work with a production

85
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:26,139
company, it's really I'm so happy that there are at least a few of these companies in the space

86
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:35,509
that can listen to this crazy nonsense. And OK, so anytime I start a show, an idea for a show,

87
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:40,070
I just write a bunch of shit. I'm like, I want this and I wanted this. And here's the whole scene.

88
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:43,669
Here's a whole scene is going to play out. He's going to open up a portal to hell through the

89
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:46,789
middle of the table. And then the screams are going to come out of that. He's going like,

90
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:52,389
I just I just write shit. And then I clean it up and we get meetings and I kind of go line by

91
00:11:52,389 --> 00:12:00,519
line and see, like, is this possible? Can we do this? And to hear people say, I don't know,

92
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:10,220
but we're going to try is actually very encouraging. So whenever I it's just so whenever

93
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,860
I get to set, right, I say this is exactly how I want it to look like. This is what I want it

94
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:22,460
to feel like. And then I get there and it's time to go. It's I love that. I love getting in there

95
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,700
and like directing and OK, no, I think they should be over there. Oh, what do you think? Yeah. You

96
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,889
think that's good. Yeah. How does it look in the camera? Let me take a look. I live for that.

97
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:42,580
Director Andy, you're a control freak. No, I'm the director. I'm the director. Dude thinks he's

98
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:54,149
Christopher Nolan. But creative direction is like some of my favorite shit. I did. That's why I do

99
00:12:54,149 --> 00:13:04,809
all this stuff is because you're an aspiring film student. I'm not James Cameron. Hey, give me a

100
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:13,929
break. But my whole point with this is when you get a group together that are as passionate,

101
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:20,299
as full of passion as you are for the project, everybody just comes to work and it's like,

102
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:24,389
let's do this shit and make it awesome. So we'll go over some of this stuff.

103
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:36,940
Film student Andy. So the problem with this segment before we start, we're just because,

104
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:42,059
you know, we're going to watch it because it's an awesome segment. The problem with the segment

105
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:48,230
was trying to time talking to Bugleberry. It's going to be 10 minutes. No, we'll skip through.

106
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:58,490
So I don't want I'm not going to ruin the magic, but Bugleberry is here right now. Right. And I

107
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:04,519
had to talk to Bugleberry after, you know, Bugleberry's segment was playing. So trying

108
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:12,659
to time out how to talk. Don't skip. Okay. Trying to have a conversation with Bugleberry. It was

109
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:22,980
very hard to do. We rehearsed it like four or five times in a row. And you'll see Bugleberry,

110
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:33,509
what are you doing? What are you talking about? There he is. No, no, no. I'm going to do my

111
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:39,340
cooking segment. What are you talking about? The thing I was the most scared about was getting

112
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:43,419
it wrong. That's not fair. That's not fair. Gerber, you told me. For instance, during rehearsal.

113
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:50,059
Very specifically. You said. Watch this. Oh, Bugleberry, you can have one segment this year.

114
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:55,379
Oh, okay. You can do whatever you want. This is my one segment. Are you going to take this from me?

115
00:14:55,379 --> 00:15:00,679
Yeah, I'm going to. Why exactly? Well, I think that you just have to, we're looking for you to maybe

116
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:07,240
help out and maybe cast a spell on the hacker's computer. And we're looking to. What did you do?

117
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,429
Oh, shit. I think I got it wrong. What did you do? Oh, I got it wrong. What websites were you on?

118
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:18,070
Let's look at your history. Right. If you get it wrong, if you can't cue up this conversation.

119
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:24,360
Is that what you did? It ruins the whole bit. Oh, okay. Which was so, that was in my brain the

120
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:32,549
entire time. Well, what do you want me to do? Let him cook. I don't have anything here. Okay,

121
00:15:32,549 --> 00:15:37,190
we don't have to watch this whole thing. I don't have any of my spell books. I wonder what he would

122
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:45,539
have made. I came to make a holiday dinner. You told me to leave all of my things at home.

123
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:49,059
What was he going to cook? Don't bring the spell book. You don't need it. So it's not here. So what

124
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:56,919
do you want me to do? I just want to watch the, okay, I won't skip. Oh, bugleberry, bugleberry.

125
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:02,820
Can you please come on the show and make a turkey? Oh yeah, sure thing, German. Oh no, people that

126
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:08,019
are showing up right now. This is full screen. It happened again. We need bugleberry to do this again.

127
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:20,070
And what is this for? Is this for a hacker? Hacker, hack you? So this part in particular,

128
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:25,100
I remember we were sitting there trying to figure out how we were going to actually do this. I'm

129
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:30,059
going to do what I can, German. Just hold on, hold tight. And underneath this table,

130
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,799
which obviously we cut a few times, but under the table there were two people from BTS

131
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:45,019
ready to pull all this shit down the hell portal. We had to get this right. This was one take,

132
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:51,019
by the way. We couldn't do this more than once. So what you are watching had to only happen once

133
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:58,659
because otherwise we've ruined the tablecloth. Everybody, I need you to stand back and that is

134
00:16:58,659 --> 00:17:03,139
you got to one take Jacob. Sometimes stand back. Everybody watching, please be careful.

135
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:08,420
I don't know what could happen here. If we got this wrong, we would have had to get,

136
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:13,980
I would have reset, get all new tablecloth, all new everything. All the stuff has already got like

137
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,140
stomach catch up all over it. We would have to reset the, it would take like an hour to reset

138
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:29,779
this whole scene. So as we go here, you'll say, Oh yeah, I, I take my sweet time doing this.

139
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:41,140
I forgot. Can you feel it? Can anybody feel it? I can. You need to hold on to something.

140
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,569
So they're under the table. These are their hands and we blocked it out in a way.

141
00:17:51,400 --> 00:18:01,500
Oh, it's so cool. We need to see it again. Hello. Oh, it was very loud, but it's all right.

142
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,259
So again, there are people under this table and look, this is behind the scenes.

143
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:09,019
If you don't want the magic ruined, then don't put on the director commentary stream. Okay.

144
00:18:13,109 --> 00:18:19,190
This, look at how this, all this stuff perfectly goes in. This was all practical. None of that

145
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:27,369
stuff was, was none of that stuff was put in after in post or anything. We actually really did that.

146
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:31,990
I think it was probably one of my favorite things I've ever done on screen.

147
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:45,500
It was fucking perfect. And all that was, was just pre people sitting under the table

148
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:54,569
ready to pull it. And we practiced it a few times. Oh, I could watch that over and over again. I love

149
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:57,609
it.

150
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:01,779
That part too.

151
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:10,819
This is a real portal to hell. Wait, what is it?

152
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,299
None of this is acting.

153
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:37,500
Somebody said this before, and I'll kind of add a little bit to it. Somebody said, I used,

154
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:43,220
somebody said I hated Bugleberry until it turned out to be something that when Jerma puts the mask

155
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:49,450
on, director commentary, by the way, no spoilers, and gets to kind of do whatever he wants.

156
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:58,279
And it's almost this therapeutic acting. I, I, this is my, I love Bugleberry. I love the,

157
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:02,200
I love the, the, I love Bugleberry. I don't, I don't know anything about Bugleberry besides

158
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:11,980
the fact that I, you know, I know him. The Bugleberry arc, trying to describe the Bugleberry

159
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:17,319
arc to people is so difficult because they, they, they look at you, they're looking like I'm crazy.

160
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:22,579
It's like, oh, so what, what, why, who is, what is this? Who is this guy? Oh, I put the, I did

161
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:26,339
this thing and everybody hated it. And everybody talked about how like, please don't, please God,

162
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:33,130
don't ever do that again. Please. Like that was just not funny. It was uncomfortable and it was

163
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:41,619
embarrassing. And for Bugleberry to go where he was five years ago or so, to here, where I,

164
00:20:41,619 --> 00:20:49,289
I think he's one of my favorite things on this whole channel. I love this character and people

165
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:53,539
like, wait, so people hate him? Well, yeah. I mean, unironically, a lot of people do.

166
00:20:54,470 --> 00:21:01,059
Why are you doing this? I don't know. Cause I feel like it. It sounds like it sounds funny.

167
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:07,900
You got him on the third try. That's right. The hot tub stream was where I think people started

168
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:16,660
to flip on them. What? What are you talking about? I cannot put the spell back in.

169
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:24,180
The spell is here now. We need to sacrifice. Also you care about very much. I'm realizing

170
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:33,690
this right now. This does not have the audio distortion. So Bugleberry real voice leak.

171
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:41,460
How about the presence under the tree? Oh, no, no, you don't want to do those. Interesting.

172
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,799
No, we're not going to start. That's not happening. It has to be something that you

173
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:53,880
care about. Not something that anybody. Oh yeah. Timing that too. Cause if you time that wrong.

174
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,039
So let's say I didn't cue that up. There'd be question marks in chat.

175
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:04,700
It'd be like, what, why did he just say that? Not happening. It has to be something that you

176
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:10,470
care about. Pre-recorded, pre-recorded. Oh, it's a bit. Let's go get those presents.

177
00:22:11,589 --> 00:22:15,589
Yes. That's what we're doing. It's the only way. It's the only way.

178
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,630
They come get the presents. And you saw that obviously.

179
00:22:20,869 --> 00:22:22,630
There's no going back. Like I already said.

180
00:22:25,589 --> 00:22:29,190
Hello. Is this a new iPhone? They get bigger every year.

181
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:42,170
I love that. Can you hear the screams? I can. What's this one? Oh, sounds like an Xbox.

182
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:45,769
I don't know why I was so obsessed with Xbox. Maybe it's not.

183
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:54,420
Oh, it hits so hard.

184
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,380
Wait, what was that? I didn't hear that.

185
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:25,019
Is it art? I didn't know that. I didn't even hear that.

186
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:38,619
By the way, I know a lot of people were mad hearing me say this.

187
00:23:39,579 --> 00:23:43,420
I don't think this game sucks. I did it for comedic effect only.

188
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:53,660
I mean, I've never played it really.

189
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:15,750
So at this point here, the hardest part of the day besides obviously doing this routine back and

190
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:21,400
forth was how do we get everybody that's on the other channel over to the main one and have people

191
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:30,099
not miss anything? And let me tell you something about fucking ads. We had to run ads in very

192
00:24:30,099 --> 00:24:39,289
specific places to get rid of pre-rolls. So if you don't know, there is a system on Twitch where

193
00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:47,349
if you run ads, you disable pre-roll ads on the channel for a certain amount of time.

194
00:24:47,349 --> 00:24:51,589
So if we're going to be making people go back and forth, especially during an incredibly

195
00:24:51,589 --> 00:24:55,420
important part like this, well, okay, the streams are coming together. We had to make sure nobody

196
00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:02,180
was going to get ads coming over back to the other channel. So trying to time, all right,

197
00:25:02,259 --> 00:25:08,420
run 60 seconds of ads right here in a spot where we know because that'll turn off pre-rolls for 15

198
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:13,619
minutes and then they can come over and we can time it in a way where they won't get a pre-roll

199
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:27,539
when it was a lot. You dislike ads very much. I don't dislike ads. I dislike ads that ruin content.

200
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:36,150
That's just the way it is. And if you can, running ads in certain places,

201
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:41,450
okay, it's a BRB screen or, okay, hey, I'm going to take a quick break and people know it's coming.

202
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:50,660
People know it's happening. If you have ads run during content, it just destroys what you're

203
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:59,859
doing. It just ruins what you're doing. Ads do make sense in certain places. They do and they can,

204
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:09,700
but not for no reason in random spots. And yeah, it ruins the bit. It ruins the magic. It really does.

205
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:17,819
If I'm doing something like this and you, oh, I heard, oh, German's doing a stream. Oh, oh,

206
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:23,339
there's this thing going on. I'm going to go check it out. And we're at this portion and you get like

207
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:29,740
a 30 second pre-roll ad or like a 60 second ad or something, you're going to miss this entire routine,

208
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:36,950
the whole thing. You can turn off mid-roll ads. Oh yeah, you can, but you can't turn off pre-rolls.

209
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:42,119
Pre-rolls are there. I cannot adjust them. The only thing I can do is run

210
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:48,549
mid-rolls to make sure that there are no pre-rolls for a certain amount of time.

211
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:54,089
So, and another thing too, and I don't want to get a go kind of off on, you know,

212
00:26:54,089 --> 00:27:01,670
ads and money and stuff, but I'm going to for a second. Trying to, look, if I take a BRB and

213
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:05,690
let's say that there was like three or four minutes of ads or something, that means I have

214
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:10,599
to take a three or four minute break. That means I have to. That means I need to figure out a way

215
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:16,299
to do it. And if I'm in the middle of something and it's like, oh shit, I know that there are ads

216
00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:21,289
that are going to be ran here for two or three minutes. Oh, okay. I'll stop what I'm doing to

217
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:27,190
make sure I don't ruin the content. You know what I'm saying? Two minutes of ads, a minute of ads,

218
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:34,619
three minutes of ads, five minutes of ads, which is why, and I'll be very honest, I'm not, I'm not

219
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:39,259
going to do any of that. I'm just not, I fucking hate it. I hate doing that. I hate fucking up

220
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:51,480
people's viewing experiences. Now, I also do very specific kinds of content like this. And that's

221
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,599
why I have such a strong opinion on ads, is because if I'm doing something like this and

222
00:27:54,599 --> 00:28:00,710
somebody misses it for some reason, it annoys me. But I do something, I'm not, this type of shit is

223
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:07,190
where I don't want ads, but sometimes you can't avoid them. But anyways, I'm kind of going off on

224
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:14,630
a tangent here, but you are not, I'm not, let me just be very honest and tell you what's happening.

225
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:19,190
And I've said this before and I'll say it again. I'm not going to ever take one of those incentive

226
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:24,779
things, ever. It's not, it just won't happen. I can't do it. Because even if it would be a shit

227
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:30,220
load of, of, of money or something, I just, I don't want to do it. I just, I, I think of

228
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:36,630
me sitting in the chair and watching a bunch of ads and it's like, oh, but this sucks because I

229
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:41,109
missed, I literally missed this because there was a two minutes of ads in the middle of this.

230
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:46,009
Or there was like, oh, I had a pre-roll or something. It, I just hate it. I really do.

231
00:28:46,250 --> 00:29:14,009
I like that part. Oh, is that a callback? Is that a callback to the pottery stream? I think so.

232
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:20,200
Oh boy. Hey, remind me to never do that again.

233
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:28,089
Actually, hold on a second. Oh, the lighting. The best part is this is practical effect lighting,

234
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:36,170
haunted house style. Cause remember Bugleberry is a Halloween character. Having the cool haunted

235
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:48,890
house type lights is what we need. Can you feel it? I can't. What do you mean?

236
00:29:49,369 --> 00:29:54,579
Just a dude doing a flashlight on and off. I mean, it's a bigger, it's a bigger than that.

237
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:04,329
And you just direct the movie already. No, no, because movies are, are way more expensive than

238
00:30:04,329 --> 00:30:19,140
this. They're way too expensive. You should just crowd fund it. No, because what if it sucks?

239
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:29,190
Do you really want me to do, all right, man, here it comes. Kickstarter or something for my new

240
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:35,670
movie. The new movie. Bugleberry's haunted hayride or whatever, whatever the hell it would be. I

241
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:43,160
don't know. A Jermis movie. Oh yeah. I need to make, yeah. I need to raise a two and a half million

242
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:50,069
dollars, five million dollars to do this. And I do it and the movie is dog shit. I don't, I would,

243
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:56,490
I don't know. It would keep me up at night forever. It would keep me up at night forever.

244
00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:02,380
Stuff like this is just, I'm going to do it. And if I can get it paid for, cool. If not, then I'm

245
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:09,779
going to have to figure that out. But I don't know if I could take on like a large multimillion

246
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:18,180
dollar movie project and have it be terrible and ruin everything in my whole life. Oh yeah, dude,

247
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:26,490
you still owe, you know, $475,000 to this vendor. Oh, you went over budget. Hey guys. Can we do a

248
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:31,210
second Kickstarter? This is the Kickstarter to pay for all the over budget. I know the movie sucked

249
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:38,740
and you all hate me now, but can I have another 500 grand? I don't know. It would have to be

250
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:56,039
something very specific. Do a, do a subathon? No. You go into real debt. Yeah. Just do super low

251
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:05,720
budget stuff. It works. Just look at this. The, all right. The thing is though, the only reason

252
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:12,390
why this happens is because I think of something that I think would be funny. And then we go,

253
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:17,849
okay, how do I develop that? I don't just, I don't want to work in reverse. Working in reverse,

254
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:24,779
I think is a problem where instead of having something that I want to do first, it's, oh,

255
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:30,410
let's make a movie. Okay. What's the movie? If I had something that I wanted to make into a movie,

256
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:36,980
then yeah, but I don't want to work backwards. Everything you've ever seen on this channel that

257
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:50,809
took more than a few weeks to make, it was never working backwards. You just confirmed the movie.

258
00:32:50,809 --> 00:32:59,109
I did not. And sure has there been random things where I've said, but yeah, but how do you make

259
00:32:59,109 --> 00:33:05,829
that right now? I'm focused on some of this, turning some of these live ideas into reality.

260
00:33:05,829 --> 00:33:11,750
And that's it. I don't know. I have no idea what, what the future is. You want power,

261
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:19,910
you want magical mystery. I'll give it to you. But there, these are natural. The reason why I

262
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:30,970
think a lot of people go, Oh wow, that was fun. I say, I say it's an iPhone. Wait, hold on.

263
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:34,490
That was way too big for an iPhone.

264
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:46,859
Oh, that part is so cool.

265
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:54,119
Cool iPhones for Christmas.

266
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:06,309
I don't want to go visit my grandmother.

267
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:18,679
All practical. Yeah, come on. Oh, come on. That wasn't all practical. Yeah, sorry. There wasn't

268
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:30,489
real fire under the table. That is the Fugleberry segment. I think we have, there's a lot of photos

269
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:37,980
too. Some of these you're going to very much enjoy. For instance, here are the, I'll come back for

270
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:45,429
this. Hi. So the, we took a bunch of these photos for his, and I, I, it's sad that I didn't have

271
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:51,820
that on. I wasn't wearing that during the actual shoot, but just kind of figured it would fall off

272
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:56,309
and get in the way. Especially during some of the stuff where I had to put my hand down and I didn't

273
00:34:56,309 --> 00:35:12,789
want to get caught on it or anything. So Chef Fugleberry, seeing this face in 4k is, is horrifying.

274
00:35:12,789 --> 00:35:21,190
Here's some of the BTS guys helping me put the hat on. Chef, please do actual Chef Fugleberry.

275
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:31,239
Yeah, like why would he do that though, right? Some of my favorite parts of Fugleberry's character

276
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:36,980
and just kind of going back and forth with Fugleberry is what is he doing here? Like why,

277
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:47,190
what, what is my relationship to Fugleberry? What is it? Why is he here? That, I, like,

278
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:57,210
am I, are we related? No, I hired him to do the scary stuff, but we've now become this,

279
00:35:57,769 --> 00:36:04,230
oh yeah, Fugleberry is just going to be there. Why? And why would he do it? I don't know. It,

280
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:16,650
it just, it, I love it. I like that. This is one of my favorite photos. So yeah, this is the,

281
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:22,170
I believe this is the day, one of the rehearsals where I think we were all trying to figure out

282
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:32,570
how exactly we were going to pull this thing through. Don't typecast Fugleberry.

283
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:36,170
That's the, that was the whole point of having him show up. That whole point of having Fugleberry

284
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:40,969
show up is he, I, he wasn't typecasted this time, but he ended up having to be typecasted.

285
00:36:40,969 --> 00:36:54,840
Think about that one. All right, so this is me obviously doing an impression of Fugleberry.

286
00:36:54,840 --> 00:37:01,079
I'm just doing an impression of that, of that person. I figured, I was here a little,

287
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:05,880
I was here early, so they let me kind of come in and, you know, pretend like I was

288
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:19,019
doing whatever Fugleberry was going to do. See under here? That's all that was.

289
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:35,639
That's what that was. Fake magic. Every time I see that, the, the air in this room when we

290
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:43,590
nailed it first try was, we, we essentially, we, we cut the cameras not long after that

291
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:48,550
and we watched it back and we were all just sitting there going, that was fucking perfect.

292
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:55,539
That was perfect. We didn't, we're not going to do that again. That's worst impression 2022.

293
00:37:55,539 --> 00:38:07,900
Get out of here. Stop ruining my immersion. Hey, this says behind the scenes of the Christmas show.

294
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:18,090
This is, you're listening to the commentary track. So yeah, that was that.

295
00:38:20,329 --> 00:38:24,489
There he is. See, he showed up a little later, but you can see the setup here.

296
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:30,139
These were the lights that they were flickering and they also, we had these under here to kind

297
00:38:30,139 --> 00:38:39,300
of turn them on a little higher. Why is Fugleberry wearing your sweater? I don't know. Maybe he was

298
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:49,190
fucking cold or something. And he was like, can I borrow your sweater? How come there's no picture

299
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:59,750
of you with him? We haven't seen all the behind the scenes yet. This is, this is just so, it's

300
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:08,949
so weird to look at this. Like why is he in, why is he here? Worst Boston moment. That category's

301
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:15,420
not coming back. That was a filler category for this year. Is there a penis on the wall?

302
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:23,849
There's no penis on the wall. Yeah, I know this camera is fucked up. Whatever. 15 minutes on

303
00:39:23,849 --> 00:39:28,809
Friday. So here's, here's part of the rehearsal with Santa, who the, that real Santa, that real

304
00:39:28,809 --> 00:39:35,699
Santa was amazing. Took direction incredibly well. Was super funny. Just an absolute pro.

305
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:42,539
Just a comp, just an absolute complete pro. And we're obviously just kind of going over

306
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:48,300
how it's going to be and minimum one hour lunch. We'll hash it out. I'm actually sorry.

307
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:05,820
Did you sit on his lap? No. Because okay, it was like, what, what, what do I want to do when he's

308
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:25,210
in here? And no, you should have. It's literally Santa. Yeah. Why are your thighs so big? What is

309
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:36,789
going on? Why do I have such huge thighs? What is, this is unedited. This is unedited. What is

310
00:40:36,789 --> 00:40:43,769
going on? No, no, this is something weird here. I think it's because my pockets were full of stuff.

311
00:40:44,489 --> 00:40:49,530
No. All right. This is what's happening. This is what's happening. In each one of these pockets

312
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:56,099
is a microphone holder. We were doing audio testing and these pants were a little tight.

313
00:40:56,099 --> 00:41:02,659
They were a little tight if I remember. So there was two huge things. I had like my phone. I had

314
00:41:03,219 --> 00:41:13,289
a mic pack. I had an audio pack and it was inflating my hips. That does look crazy.

315
00:41:15,989 --> 00:41:26,380
That looks so fucked up. Oh my God. I feel like there's another, I feel like there's a body

316
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:32,380
going back and another pair of legs. Like this is a centaur. You know what I'm saying? Like there's

317
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:43,099
a back this way and legs here. Holy shit. What's happening? All right. Anyways, behind the scenes

318
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:48,650
that was Santa Santa. We, we only had Santa for a little while. So we had to really nail that,

319
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:57,019
which a lot of the stuff really just, there was so much stress and anxiety on getting to these

320
00:41:57,019 --> 00:42:02,840
points correctly. Every meeting we had, every time we were sitting here on the, on the deck,

321
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,679
which is essentially a stage kind of going over where people are going to be standing and how it's

322
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:12,280
going to play out. Okay. In the back of everybody's mind, it's, are we actually going to be able to do

323
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:21,900
this? I don't know, but we're going to find out really soon. And I think that's what I,

324
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:33,340
that's what I like the most is, is this going to work? Will it actually make sense? I think it's,

325
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:45,210
it's challenging in a way. Pixar mom. Well, it's a live show. So yeah. Yeah. It's a live show with a

326
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:50,920
lot of stuff happening. Stop talking about his thighs. All right. I'm going to move on from this.

327
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:56,739
This one better not be worse. So this is practicing the bugleberry segment,

328
00:42:56,739 --> 00:43:00,500
which was, we did this probably five times over the course of a few days.

329
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:10,260
The channel, the channel was hacked. I'll make it up to you. We need some help. I need, we have

330
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:18,679
engineers here doing all kinds of shit. It's not there. Yeah. So that's this rehearsal.

331
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:30,300
Who played bugleberry? A mystery, a mystery actor, mystery actor. What do you mean actor?

332
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:37,530
Who played, what do you mean? Yeah. Let's go back a little further. What do you mean?

333
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:48,489
The real person. What do you mean actor? But yeah, that's some video footage. There's a picture or

334
00:43:48,489 --> 00:43:59,750
two. This is weird to look at. This is just a kind of a view of the whole set. So originally I was

335
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:05,260
going to walk behind the tree and destroy the tree in the beginning. You know, in the beginning where

336
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:08,300
I'm kind of yelling at everybody, I'm telling everybody to shut up. One of the, originally it

337
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:13,019
was like, I want to go back here and I want to pull the fucking tree down and walk back and get

338
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:17,940
backstage here. But turned out it's probably a dangerous thing to do.

339
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:22,809
Pulling a tree down like that, connected to a bunch of wires. It was just, it was like,

340
00:44:22,809 --> 00:44:27,210
eh, we probably shouldn't do that. That would have been probably pretty bad. So we decided not to do

341
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:34,860
it. Somebody in this building did. Now this is the rehearsal for this. Otherwise you and I had done,

342
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:47,800
by the way, this was made for us. Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, hey. People's heads like high heels.

343
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:53,110
Otherwise you and I had done, by the way, this was made for us.

344
00:44:53,110 --> 00:45:00,420
The strut. So people were asking if I was supposed to throw the coffee in Atriox's face.

345
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:05,780
And I decided not to. No, I wanted just to dump it on the ground without even mentioning it because

346
00:45:06,789 --> 00:45:11,530
what a fucking piece of shit. Like this is just, I'm just going to dump this because it's not the

347
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:15,849
way that I wanted it. And I can already tell that by looking at it. So I'm just dumping it on the

348
00:45:15,849 --> 00:45:21,190
ground and someone's going to clean that up for me. But no, it wasn't because I didn't want to

349
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:28,230
throw it. Actually, Atriox actually did say, hey, dude, throw that coffee in my face if you want.

350
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:31,510
I'm just like, ah, do you want to do it? He's like, yeah, dude, if you want to throw it in my face,

351
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:37,780
just throw the coffee directly in my face. And we decided against it because he had to show up a

352
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:48,599
little later, obviously, for the 1v1. But we also, if you look at how it played out,

353
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:57,539
well, it doesn't show it here. But the scary part was because the person that's back here

354
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:05,219
with a huge camera and the concern was dumping it on the ground right here because this,

355
00:46:05,219 --> 00:46:08,820
the cameraman follows me through when we were blocking this whole thing out.

356
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:12,920
All right, you're going to follow me through here. We're going to go this way. And being in this

357
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:19,860
position where the cameraman had like 40 pound camera, this was dangerous walking through that.

358
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:24,179
So what we had to do is I had to make sure that I dumped it kind of over almost in this doorway,

359
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:31,800
like back here. So he could walk through it without having to be scared of tripping.

360
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:40,280
This is a pose. This is a pose. Stop. Stop it. This is a pose. I'm not getting any height from

361
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:48,619
this. It's the pose. This is a pose. All right, let's prove it in real time.

362
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:57,900
Okay, still doing it. Still doing it. Where's the height? Where's the height change? There is no

363
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:06,699
height change. It's exactly the same. Exactly the same. Proving that it is a pose again once

364
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:11,739
and for all. There is no change in height from here to here. It's exactly the same.

365
00:47:24,389 --> 00:47:30,389
Somebody said, I, before going to look for these two, I go, where's Ludwig? I need to talk to him.

366
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:33,909
And then I finally run into him and I just go, I don't want to talk to you. Get out of here. Go

367
00:47:33,909 --> 00:47:44,809
clean that up. I was like, well, I, that's who I was looking for. Oh, here's the, uh, here's the

368
00:47:44,809 --> 00:47:53,210
toast. I know it's, I mean, whatever. It's a thing. So before every show, yeah, I got caught on the

369
00:47:53,210 --> 00:48:01,239
hot mic. I got caught on the hot mic. Whatever. So before every show, if people want to do it,

370
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:06,619
we do a toast. And it's, you know, it's like, if you, if you don't, if you don't drink, if you

371
00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:09,820
don't feel like, if you don't want to, obviously if you have stuff going on later, don't, you know,

372
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:15,260
don't be drinking and shit, right? So you don't have to, but we do this thing. Everybody takes

373
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:20,789
a shot of whatever we have, whatever anybody wants. And we go, let's do it. People say a few

374
00:48:20,789 --> 00:48:31,219
words. It's a nice way to kind of just be like, let's go for it. Alcohol Andy. What is in here?

375
00:48:31,219 --> 00:48:38,440
I think that they had, I want to say this was Jim Bean or Jack Daniel. It was, it was, I think it

376
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:49,579
was Jim Bean. What did you drink? I think it was just Jim Bean. But yeah, I, the, the point is not

377
00:48:49,579 --> 00:48:55,420
with this, the point is not to, oh, everybody, let's get drunk. That's not the point. It's just

378
00:48:55,420 --> 00:49:01,619
a kind of a, it's like a toast at a wedding, right? Except it's not a wedding. Did you do the cat

379
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:12,920
puke sound? This is theater kids simulator. Um, theater kid. What are you, what, theater kids

380
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:17,690
backstage? What are you talking, drinking? What are you talking about? What the hell do you mean?

381
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:28,309
I am an adult. Your feet aren't on camera. You're on your tippy toes. All right. I banned that person

382
00:49:28,309 --> 00:49:33,130
actually for an hour. I want that person timed up for one full hour and then reduce that by,

383
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:38,059
by 50 minutes. I want them timed up for 10 minutes. Time the person up for 10 minutes.

384
00:49:42,619 --> 00:49:48,760
But yeah, it's, it's just something to do. It's something to, it's so funny how I treat a lot of

385
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:58,550
these events. It's important that everyone has fun. That's one of the most important things.

386
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:04,980
So if everyone's here having a good time, it's treated like a fun get together in a way. Everyone

387
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:13,400
just has more fun and everybody cares more about it. So I like doing that kind of stuff. So it's

388
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:18,199
not just like, okay, you're everybody, you do your job. You do your job. Stop. Okay. You, you're

389
00:50:18,199 --> 00:50:21,559
going to talk to me only when, when we're going to talk about work stuff and you're going to show

390
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:25,239
up here and then, okay. And then we'll talk maybe for five seconds and you'll never see me ever

391
00:50:25,239 --> 00:50:31,320
again. No, I would rather do it and have everybody essentially treat it like it's a time where we're

392
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:36,659
getting together and have a fun time. They're not visible. Again, time that person up for one

393
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:51,449
minute diminishing returns. So this is the end. It was so good. I was blown away by how unbelievable

394
00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:56,329
top shelf vocalist. Can we just give a round of applause for a second? That was so, that was

395
00:50:56,329 --> 00:51:09,849
unbelievable. Four people, right? Four. They just, it just sounded like a whole chorus of like 15

396
00:51:09,849 --> 00:51:19,210
people. It was so good. See you later. I felt so bad too, because when we were going over rehearsals

397
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:25,110
and like directing, what's going to happen. Okay. So directing, right? Directing. So it's like,

398
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:29,190
okay, well I, what I want to happen here is this is what's going to happen. This is how it plays

399
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:32,949
out. We're going to be standing here. And what I want is, you know, you're going to be singing

400
00:51:32,949 --> 00:51:40,119
and then I'm going to join you and we're going to get cut off. And cutting off a very talented

401
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:48,659
singing group within 10 seconds of their first song is just that, that sucks. And we wanted to

402
00:51:48,659 --> 00:51:53,139
make sure that they had a very good amount of screen time to get a full kind of five minutes

403
00:51:53,139 --> 00:52:00,710
on camera doing a few songs. It was evil. Yeah. But I thought it was fun. And they were super,

404
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:09,300
super into it too. They were so fun to work with. They got it immediately. All the elves here too.

405
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:16,409
Oh, the cookies. Right. Oh, Bugleberry. Yeah. This is, this is literally the lap. I think the

406
00:52:16,409 --> 00:52:22,949
camera was off at this point. Look at how tall everybody is. All right. Can we go over this?

407
00:52:22,949 --> 00:52:31,590
Look at how tall all the off-brand guys are. They're gigantic. They're so, look at how tall

408
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:38,420
they are. They're towering over everybody. Come on. Everyone talked about, wow, dude,

409
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:49,590
Santa was so much. Santa was like six, five, six, six. He was a very tall man. See you later.

410
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:59,989
That was the end. Oh, a dog that, uh, BTS had just kind of dogs hanging out. They were, uh,

411
00:52:59,989 --> 00:53:09,380
people would bring their dogs to work, which was, it was so cute. Good dog. It's a presence.

412
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:21,099
This is just, we're taking pictures of stuff just to remember it. Oh, audio equipment. I think these

413
00:53:21,099 --> 00:53:26,710
pictures just show how much thought went into what, because this was just a set. Nothing here did

414
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:36,900
anything. Nothing. All of this stuff was just to make it look like this was a room that was a

415
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:44,869
behind the scenes room. There's nothing here is like connected to anything. Oh, that's a good

416
00:53:44,869 --> 00:53:52,500
picture. That's a Christmas card. And these two were connected to each other. So they were just

417
00:53:52,500 --> 00:54:11,219
part of the set. Holy jolly Christmas. Oh, there he is. There's the, the coming into the clutch.

418
00:54:11,219 --> 00:54:27,699
That thing was actually full of toys. That was a full bag of toys. That's a great photo too.

419
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:37,579
Now here's the beginning. Yeah, there is the hacker. Well, we'll go back for a second here.

420
00:54:38,139 --> 00:54:44,199
So in the very beginning of this stream, I think people were saying, what's wrong with him?

421
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:56,519
Why is he acting so off? It's like trying to do that overly kind of that overly positive atmosphere.

422
00:54:56,519 --> 00:55:02,519
But in like a really off putting way, somebody said, dude, you look like you made out of wax

423
00:55:02,519 --> 00:55:06,280
and stuff. Like this is, this was scary. People said this was scary. The way that I was like

424
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:19,769
acting and talking the first like 20 minutes of the stream, you were acting like Ellen. It was very

425
00:55:19,769 --> 00:55:40,860
off putting. Good. That's what I wanted. Do you have make? Yeah. I have a bunch of makeup on too.

426
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:58,570
These look like stock photos. He was awesome. Here's the real production room. Not the fake

427
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:02,489
one that you saw already. This is the real production room. This is where they were all

428
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:08,090
adjusting things, pumping in the videos, getting things ready, adjusting, switching cameras. This

429
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:16,570
is the actual set. This is the, yeah, this is the NASA set. This is the real one landing crew.

430
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:26,699
You should have used this. Well, I mean, no, I can't because the whole point of that fake production

431
00:56:26,699 --> 00:56:43,300
room, I mean, look, you're on whatever XQC six consoles. Anyways, when you're gonna do a moon

432
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:47,860
landing stream, that actually would be kind of funny to have a huge set up like this with like

433
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:55,480
a hundred monitors. And it's me going into space and just a bunch of shit goes wrong. And there's

434
00:56:55,480 --> 00:57:11,369
a whole room of like 50 people issuing me commands and stuff. Do it. I don't know. Space station

435
00:57:11,369 --> 00:57:24,809
stream. How would you even do that? I don't know. How did we do this? Just figure it out.

436
00:57:24,809 --> 00:57:30,309
Yeah. So again, this is the fake room. We had the two engineers here. Those were, those were just

437
00:57:30,309 --> 00:57:46,730
actors. They just sat there just typing the whole day. Who the fuck are you? Oh, that's right.

438
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:52,440
I love it. So this is, we're going over kind of the, how the day is. So this is, this is probably

439
00:57:53,079 --> 00:57:59,690
15 to 20 minutes before the stream, maybe like 30 minutes before the stream. And we're going over,

440
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:04,570
just because a lot of people showed up for the day. You're, he's short. I'm a very, all right,

441
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:12,280
you know what? Time out that word. There's no pose here. Look, there's no pose. All right. I'm

442
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:21,190
not going to address it anymore. Do you know how tall people really are? Good. You know what? I'm

443
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:34,360
a little bit smaller. Who gives a shit? You know how fucking strong I am and how tough I am?

444
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:42,570
Anyways, a lot of people showed up the day out. So trying to get everybody up to speed that wasn't

445
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:47,369
around for the last four or five days of setting up all this stuff. So kind of have to give the

446
00:58:47,369 --> 00:59:05,880
overview of exactly what's happening for the day. Extinguisher exposed. He was, he's in this photo.

447
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:15,860
How did he do that? So to me, this is, the show's over, right? And it's just like, oh, thank God.

448
00:59:18,099 --> 00:59:30,820
To me, that's like a, oh, it's done. Everybody working. Here are the elves just hanging out,

449
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:50,460
preparing for the day. They were awesome too. Every single one of them was just kind of,

450
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:56,869
when we did the breakdown. Oh, look, Doug. When we did the breakdown, it's just, okay, so you're

451
00:59:56,869 --> 01:00:00,949
going to do a puzzle, but you don't actually have to. You can kind of do whatever you want in here.

452
01:00:00,949 --> 01:00:06,789
I probably shouldn't have said that. I probably shouldn't have said, oh, you can just do whatever

453
01:00:06,789 --> 01:00:12,230
you want. Don't even do the puzzle if you don't care. It actually made it way funnier, I think.

454
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:17,929
When I, when we checked in halfway through the stream and there was, it was just pieces on the

455
01:00:17,929 --> 01:00:26,070
ground and they were just sitting at the table. What was the purpose of the elves to do the puzzle?

456
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:34,570
And we were going to check in on them and see their progress. It's just pieces dumped on the

457
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:42,230
ground. To be fair though, let's be very fair. That picture, I don't know if we can see it,

458
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:49,099
the picture that they were doing was that promotional picture from about four or five

459
01:00:49,099 --> 01:00:57,929
days before the show. Almost every piece is the same color. I think it was actually impossible.

460
01:00:57,929 --> 01:01:03,929
Look at just this one because it's actually pretty hard to find or buy a puzzle that's 10,000 plus

461
01:01:03,929 --> 01:01:13,289
pieces. So these are four individual two or 3000 piece puzzles each. So it's just a quadrant of

462
01:01:13,289 --> 01:01:20,940
the image and they were supposed to put it together. So how do you even do this part?

463
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:27,110
Because this part just is this part. It's just a image of lights. How would you ever do it?

464
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:33,269
Impossible. Even getting a border would be impossible. I think at one point we would like,

465
01:01:33,269 --> 01:01:40,219
we just kind of like, oh, is it really hard? Just try to do the face. The face, this section is the

466
01:01:40,219 --> 01:01:49,019
same color as all this. It's just the same thing. Every piece was like red or orange. I don't know.

467
01:01:49,019 --> 01:02:00,090
I just want to see what would happen. You have a fucked up brain, man. Yeah, well, is that right?

468
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:10,650
We'll have fun here. You have a fucked up brain. So this was the camera op and this, he wasn't

469
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:16,409
supposed to do this. He came up to me and was like, hey, do we have any extra elf costumes?

470
01:02:16,409 --> 01:02:22,869
I'm like, ah, I think so. Maybe. Let's find out. He's like, I just kind of want to wear one. So I

471
01:02:22,869 --> 01:02:29,210
make sure I'm in the shots dressed like this. I was like, all right, that's perfect. That's a great

472
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:40,219
idea. Go for it. But look at that thing. Look at this camera. That's why we were concerned about

473
01:02:40,219 --> 01:02:50,090
putting the Dump in the Coffee directly on the ground, because that's scary. Oh, look, an elf.

474
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:58,659
I love that rig so much. This was elaborate. This was spring loaded. I swear when he was

475
01:02:58,659 --> 01:03:06,550
walking around, it was like, he was like a robot. This thing was like compressed air and spring

476
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:14,710
loaded. It was crazy. Oh, look at that. I don't think we're gonna, you know, I didn't think we're

477
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:24,150
gonna put in the wholesome Ludwig hug. Come on. Which the off-brand was awesome. And when I

478
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:28,519
originally trying to pitch the show around to a production company or a group that wanted to

479
01:03:28,519 --> 01:03:35,619
tackle it, it was, all right, who has time? Who wants to try it? Who wants to go for it?

480
01:03:35,619 --> 01:03:40,630
And off-brand, they were just like, let's do it. And it was a really short time frame, too.

481
01:03:41,929 --> 01:03:49,159
Um, I kind of got the urge really, because this show, I wrote all this stuff probably

482
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:56,739
a year and a half ago, two years ago. Didn't ever do it. I swear to God, this show sat as a

483
01:03:56,739 --> 01:04:04,659
document in a folder of just a few, like three or four pages of just shit that I just let sit there.

484
01:04:04,659 --> 01:04:11,539
And I finally was like, you know what? I'm doing it this year. I want to do it. So, uh, talking to

485
01:04:11,539 --> 01:04:21,530
off-brand to try to get it off the ground was just, they were so into it immediately. And I

486
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:28,460
believe it was like the last week of October where I was like, hey, I want to put together a whole

487
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:33,909
elaborate Christmas streamer. A bunch of crazy shit happens. And here's, here's the, here's the

488
01:04:33,909 --> 01:04:39,269
script and here's all the stuff. Here's the, here it is. And they were just like, what the fuck?

489
01:04:39,269 --> 01:04:47,340
Holy shit, dude. All right. Um, yeah, let's go for it. And we banged this project out in one month.

490
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:57,639
It was one month, maybe even less than that. So they didn't know they did a hell of a job.

491
01:04:57,639 --> 01:05:14,409
Oh, of course there's more elves. Engineer. It's like the, it's like the creep. Like I just looked

492
01:05:14,409 --> 01:05:30,230
like creepy. Wow. This is scary. I don't like this photo. Holy shit. This is right at the turn.

493
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:56,570
Oh, do I have gray hair? This photo is actually pretty scary. Uh-oh. Mask coming off. And this

494
01:05:56,570 --> 01:06:04,500
also too. What is wrong with you if you were to do something like this? Oh, I'm going to join in too.

495
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:15,139
What do you, sit down, you idiot. Sit down. You're not doing that. You hire a group to come and do

496
01:06:15,139 --> 01:06:22,949
this and then you're just going to be part of the group and sing with them. This is the kind of shit

497
01:06:22,949 --> 01:06:27,190
that if you're at like a company meeting or like a company party, and that's where a lot of the,

498
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:32,860
a lot of the ideas that I had for the show were from that kind of thing. Like company party,

499
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:39,480
where the CEO gets up there and tries to kind of act like, um, yeah, it's, well, I'm, I'm,

500
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:44,440
I'm one of the workers and I'm super smart and I'm super funny and I'm very talented

501
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:50,599
and I'm going to show you and everybody here loves and respects me. That was the vibe. So why,

502
01:06:50,599 --> 01:06:58,010
what are you, what are you doing up there? It was just so painful and a lot of people,

503
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:03,289
I'm looking back, I've seen a lot of clips and stuff and a lot of uploads and highlights and,

504
01:07:03,849 --> 01:07:15,829
and comments. It feels being like this part, I hated more than anything. This is the worst part.

505
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:36,440
Michael Scott type beat. I was just going for, because you got to let people do what they're

506
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:45,030
good at. And I think a lot of this stream was let people do what they're good at and don't

507
01:07:45,030 --> 01:07:49,349
implant and insert yourself into other people doing interesting things, I think.

508
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:07,110
Super in character. He's ready, he's reading, he's getting ready, getting ready for me to grab him.

509
01:08:07,110 --> 01:08:19,779
Why do you look so mad? Did you watch the stream? You see what happened? Do you have any idea what

510
01:08:19,779 --> 01:08:42,359
happened to me that day? Still got it. Still got it. He was furious. He's still mad. By the way,

511
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:49,060
do you see what this says? I think this says late night with Ludwig. I believe that's what

512
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:57,420
that actually says. So by the way, this is actually the run of show. So what a run of show is. So a

513
01:08:57,420 --> 01:09:03,079
couple of weeks before we would get into meetings for an hour or two every couple of days, I'd say,

514
01:09:03,079 --> 01:09:10,470
and we go over point by point exactly what is going to happen at every moment of the show.

515
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:17,590
And when you get one of these, you need to stick to it. Otherwise, it can really go off the rails

516
01:09:17,590 --> 01:09:23,210
when people just don't know what's happening next. So if you change a run of show, you have to make

517
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:29,930
sure that everybody knows you're changing it. And we did. We actually changed the run of show.

518
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:36,579
We were not supposed to do the we were not supposed to stay with the awards. We're supposed to go all

519
01:09:36,579 --> 01:09:42,619
the way through, I believe, like 12, 13, 14 awards before we did the merge. So we essentially I

520
01:09:42,619 --> 01:09:46,819
thought that was going to be too long because as we were doing the first 20, 30 minutes,

521
01:09:46,819 --> 01:09:50,899
it was it was becoming pretty clear that I was I want this to go a little faster.

522
01:09:50,899 --> 01:09:57,930
I want to merge sooner. So we kind of copy and paste. Oh, shit, sorry. We copy and pasted.

523
01:09:58,489 --> 01:10:02,569
This is during the show, by the way. This is during one of the BRBs. It was like we

524
01:10:02,569 --> 01:10:08,810
took the parts that happened before the merge and just moved them forward so we could get right to

525
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:14,680
it. I didn't want people to stick around because when it became pretty clear that people were

526
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:20,649
actually thinking that this is what the joke was and that was it. I was like, oh, this channel is

527
01:10:20,649 --> 01:10:27,300
compromised and he's on this other channel just doing the awards. All right, that's kind of funny,

528
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:31,619
but like, it's like, I don't know. I'm out of here. So we wanted to make sure that we got through that

529
01:10:31,619 --> 01:10:40,920
faster. You got to go sometimes. But I think it was right at that perfect time period where people

530
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:48,949
started to go, what the fuck, dude? Please. So we just moved it immediately. Were you afraid of

531
01:10:48,949 --> 01:10:55,800
people reporting the channel? Yes. And for weeks we talked to Twitch to tell them this was happening.

532
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:02,680
Hey, Twitch, this is happening. This is not real. And they had to, I mean, because obviously they

533
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:06,119
had to know. If they didn't know, then that would, I'm sure the channel probably would get turned

534
01:11:06,119 --> 01:11:23,270
off pretty quickly. No, this is the puzzle. Do you see, oh, by the way, behind here, this is the snow,

535
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:32,470
the snow part. How did you merge the streams? So, I mean, German985, this channel was just live

536
01:11:33,109 --> 01:11:42,939
and we've raided my channel from the other one. And then when the raid happened after the raid,

537
01:11:42,939 --> 01:11:48,619
we made sure it went through. And then the other, the other stream was turned off. It just,

538
01:11:48,619 --> 01:11:59,100
we just turned it off. So there was only one place where everything was going to be.

539
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:13,380
What is this pose? What the hell, what is this? What is this? Oh, very rare, complete back of the

540
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:24,199
head, by the way. Very rare. And I'll tell you, it's a, it's thinning a little, but pretty clean,

541
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:29,529
pretty clean back of the head. Probably could've used a little, I probably could've styled it a

542
01:12:29,529 --> 01:12:36,970
little more. He's balding? Oh, I mean, not really. A little. Whatever. Fine. Oh, this,

543
01:12:36,970 --> 01:12:50,020
where the thing hits me in the head. Nice Lego hair. Yeah, I pressed the wrong button. A stage

544
01:12:50,020 --> 01:13:00,939
weight hits me in the head. Was it scripted? Yeah. It missed you. It hit me like on the forehead.

545
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:07,579
It went like, it scraped the top of my head and like scraped my nose. It's all right. It still,

546
01:13:07,579 --> 01:13:19,500
doesn't matter. It still worked. How heavy was it? It was very heavy. No, it wasn't heavy at all.

547
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:27,779
The ice pack. I think I am going gray. I think it is happening. Right here, look. 4K camera.

548
01:13:27,779 --> 01:13:42,630
You can't hide it. Maybe a little. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. This is right after the break when we came back

549
01:13:42,630 --> 01:13:54,489
of me yelling at everybody and getting hit in the head. These things always fall out of my ear.

550
01:13:54,489 --> 01:14:03,529
I remember this was such an issue for me. Uh, that before Dollhouse, we actually made a custom

551
01:14:03,529 --> 01:14:12,279
one that I had to actually go, I had to go to a special lab to get a, a mold of the inside of my

552
01:14:12,279 --> 01:14:24,489
ear. Just because these things always fall out. I always have such trouble with them. This feels

553
01:14:24,489 --> 01:14:45,159
like it was upscaled. That's how good this camera is. Oh, best bro. That's the first one. You look

554
01:14:45,159 --> 01:14:54,899
completely different in every picture. It's just, it's just angles. It's angles. So my,

555
01:14:54,899 --> 01:15:02,520
my face is, and my hair is kind of different. This part of, this half of my face. Remember,

556
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:05,880
I've talked about this before. People that go, dude, why do you look like a different guy

557
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:13,859
in this picture? I'll tell you. Because I have an angular face. My face is pretty angular. So my face

558
01:15:13,859 --> 01:15:21,939
kind of goes like this. My face goes like this. It's kind of sideways. So when you see from this

559
01:15:21,939 --> 01:15:27,930
angle, you're seeing it go this way. When you, when I go like this, you're seeing the other part

560
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:32,550
where it's angled a different way. You know what I mean? My chin's a little more pronounced on this

561
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:40,470
side. It's because it's angular this way. My nose is kind of this way. Yeah. So it's just, it looks

562
01:15:40,470 --> 01:15:50,899
a little different. You know what I mean? You're making this up. I am not making this up. That's

563
01:15:50,899 --> 01:16:04,020
why everybody says that. Troll face. One thing I'll tell you though, one thing I am very, very

564
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:10,310
concerned about. I'm getting concerned about this and that's how you know I'm getting older.

565
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:15,239
I'm starting to get the turkey neck. Do you see what I mean? It's happening. I'm getting,

566
01:16:15,239 --> 01:16:22,979
I'm kind of getting that like tortoise turkey neck. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. I'm gonna start moisturizing

567
01:16:22,979 --> 01:16:30,869
that area. I'm gonna start to like, moisturize this area. Tighten it up. Uh-oh. It's starting.

568
01:16:30,869 --> 01:16:46,260
Yeah, it's starting. I'm getting, it's happening. This is what happens when you turn 40.

569
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:55,350
Moist neck Andy. You're insecure. No, I'm really not. I'm just messing around. I'm very

570
01:16:55,350 --> 01:17:11,979
comfortable with uh, with me. So I'm good. Another scary image. I love how he's just not

571
01:17:11,979 --> 01:17:20,899
paying, he's kind of just ignoring me. Just hanging out with the boys. There it is.

572
01:17:27,699 --> 01:17:37,609
Watching it on, that's funny. How the hell were they ever gonna do this? How are you ever gonna

573
01:17:37,609 --> 01:17:52,149
do this? Let's be real. How were you ever going to do that? These swabs? Oh, oh, right, right,

574
01:17:52,149 --> 01:17:58,359
right, right. For, okay. I was like, why does he have cotton swabs in his hand? Because we did the,

575
01:17:58,359 --> 01:18:08,819
oh, I'm boxing, right? Okay. We're gonna give you like the, on the lip. Give you the uh, the ice pack.

576
01:18:08,819 --> 01:18:13,140
The water, he kept squeezing the water and I opened my mouth and I would close my mouth and he would

577
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:27,380
keep squeezing it. You're doing COVID testing? This is a great shot. He was stealing your DNA.

578
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:42,739
I love the green of the room too. It just comes to life here. So if you want to know, the, the

579
01:18:42,739 --> 01:18:50,460
set designer is the same set designer that did Juiced. You remember Omega Juicer, right? It's

580
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:57,779
the same exact person. They did an amazing job. She's one of those people that you can just say,

581
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:03,460
this is what I want it to look like and here's uh, here's some, a few paragraphs of what it looks

582
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:10,899
like. Can you make that a reality? Bet your ass I can. And it was better than I ever imagined.

583
01:19:10,899 --> 01:19:19,579
This set was better than I thought it was going to look. It was just way better.

584
01:19:19,579 --> 01:19:34,020
Bottom left face. That is a face. You're right. Did you actually play Cod? Yes. It's like,

585
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:40,699
ah, the bros, the bro is cheering on their bro in the finals of his fantasy football league

586
01:19:40,699 --> 01:19:53,750
is what this looks like. Why do I look so weird? Like the last game of the season, man,

587
01:19:53,750 --> 01:20:05,939
I could get the whole pot. I come with the whatever. This more Bugleberry.

588
01:20:05,939 --> 01:20:17,060
Was the loss scripted? Yes, it was. Sorry to say. And when I was up like 3-0 in that first round,

589
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:25,739
I was like, oh shit, I actually can't win this because we had to, it wasn't scripted.

590
01:20:26,569 --> 01:20:34,409
It wasn't planned. I'm lying. I'm sorry. I lied to you. Throwing for content. I was up 3-0.

591
01:20:34,409 --> 01:20:46,569
I said, was the Bugleberry footage pre-recorded? So we, um, at the beginning of the stream,

592
01:20:46,569 --> 01:20:52,460
we went over the whole thing. Yes, this whole thing was pre-recorded. Um, it's, I'll give you

593
01:20:52,460 --> 01:21:00,149
a quick fun story. So, chess boxing, if you remember, I did the announcing. I actually

594
01:21:00,149 --> 01:21:07,369
missed the rehearsal for chess boxing. I couldn't go because we were filming this. So, the day

595
01:21:07,369 --> 01:21:13,180
before, before the chess boxing event, I was supposed to be at rehearsal and this was our,

596
01:21:13,180 --> 01:21:18,939
we already planned to do this. So I missed the rehearsal and did this instead. And then the next

597
01:21:18,939 --> 01:21:42,550
day, chess boxing. And then a week later, did this. He was directing Bugleberry. He's a director.

598
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:47,050
How come the extinguisher isn't streaming right now? I think the extinguisher did a stream

599
01:21:47,050 --> 01:21:52,170
and talked about some behind the scenes stuff. It was awesome to work with. He, honestly, he came

600
01:21:52,170 --> 01:22:00,250
in at such a clutch because originally the extinguisher was going to be one of these two.

601
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:09,380
That was what that actor was going to do. And we lost our, we, we had somebody cast as the hacker

602
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:17,020
already and we lost out on that. Um, there was some issues with getting that person to be able

603
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:23,529
to be in that, in this spot at this time. So very short notice. And this is, I'm not, I'm not even

604
01:22:23,529 --> 01:22:29,659
talking two days before the show, three days before the show. It was somebody else has to be

605
01:22:29,659 --> 01:22:38,090
the extinguisher. So came through and the clutch actually crushed it. And that was on three days

606
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:47,130
notice. Not even probably. Yeah. Well, Josh just linked the, if you want to hear some more behind

607
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:50,869
the scenes stuff from the extinguisher's point of view, there's a link in the chat right there.

608
01:22:50,869 --> 01:22:57,979
But yeah, it just all came together and the room turning red with, we had the portal and everything

609
01:22:57,979 --> 01:23:09,260
It got really weird. Yeah, there you go. Was the hacker always called the extinguisher?

610
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:18,340
No, we, we kind of bounced around a few names and it was like, should I be German986? Should I be,

611
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:22,699
you know, um, you know, like the murderer or something? We were just trying to figure out

612
01:23:22,699 --> 01:23:36,840
random names. Nice theater shot. You said there's a shit stain on my pants? Oh, you said there's,

613
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:46,380
whatever. Why did I even read that? Why did I read that? This is what I strangled him.

614
01:23:46,539 --> 01:23:53,510
Yeah, there was a, there was a production person that was just hanging out under his desk, just

615
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:58,630
like out of frame. And every time we, we obviously rehearsed this a few times and figured out exactly

616
01:23:58,630 --> 01:24:03,670
how it was going to happen. It's actually so funny because I don't know if we should, if I could show

617
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:10,569
it, but when I put my leg through, this is a different pair of shoes. This is like, there's

618
01:24:10,569 --> 01:24:20,039
not, I'm very clearly was wearing dress shoes and they were just these nice sneakers. So what

619
01:24:20,039 --> 01:24:25,989
happened? You going through a portal, change the shoes. It was, hey, portals, fuck with stuff.

620
01:24:25,989 --> 01:24:37,340
It was a poor, hey, it was a portal. Can't be perfect. Santa again. And you are going to

621
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:52,649
apologize. He was the real deal. He, you knew when he was walking around, he made noise. You could

622
01:24:52,649 --> 01:25:01,640
hear Santa from down across the entire studio. He was wearing bells. It was just like, when he

623
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:06,539
would take a step. I think we actually had him take them off. So people weren't, wouldn't hear

624
01:25:06,539 --> 01:25:31,100
it through the mic. My God, what the fuck? My eyes don't even look real. Those, my eyes don't look

625
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:37,300
real. They don't look like real people eyes. This doesn't look like a real person's eyes. Why are

626
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:51,100
they so like gelatinous? They're gelatinous. That's weird looking, the puzzle room. Oh, they actually

627
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:57,850
got Santa back there. I knew he was back there. Cool. See how big looking Santa is, is really

628
01:25:57,850 --> 01:26:12,489
tall. I think this is when we chilled out and we just did the awards. Yeah. At this point,

629
01:26:12,489 --> 01:26:17,750
I think it was like, it's time to relax because now we don't have to worry about any weird,

630
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:24,010
crazy shit. We're just going to do the awards now, which I hope that as the kind of day went

631
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:30,810
along, I was really hoping that people would, after all the weird stuff. All right. Now we're

632
01:26:30,810 --> 01:26:44,550
just chilling. And this is just, we're hanging out now. I hope that came across. Yeah. Okay. Good.

633
01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:49,720
It was good. Yeah. Cause I know a lot of people were looking forward to this and

634
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:55,260
every year we do this and I didn't want to ruin it. I wanted to kind of keep that same vibe. When

635
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:59,659
we did get back on the main channel, I wanted to have that same vibe from previous years.

636
01:26:59,659 --> 01:27:08,060
We were just kind of chilling, hanging out, laughing. There was no rumble. No, there was no

637
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:12,220
time to do a rumble this year because this has obviously took up all the time that I would have

638
01:27:12,220 --> 01:27:20,810
done something like that. And plus, I mean, if I, if I can't think of, for instance, okay,

639
01:27:20,810 --> 01:27:25,210
should there be a rumble during this? I don't think it would have fit. I think it would have

640
01:27:25,210 --> 01:27:34,569
been too much going on. So it essentially replaced it. I think it would have been way too disjointed

641
01:27:34,569 --> 01:27:38,970
if it's, okay, guys, the channel we got, it's on a different channel and we're going to do the awards

642
01:27:38,970 --> 01:27:42,729
and here comes the first match on the channel. Am I going to do it? I feel like people would be

643
01:27:42,729 --> 01:27:52,359
like, what? I can't even pay attention, dude. Like, what the fuck is going on? But I, I don't want

644
01:27:52,359 --> 01:27:58,789
to give away anything, but there, there I do. No, we're not going to talk about it. We're not

645
01:27:58,789 --> 01:28:03,960
even going to talk about it. But no, there's not going to be a, there's not going to be a stream on

646
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:11,100
New Year's this, this time. I'm going to take some time here after this stream because it's been a

647
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:17,029
very, very busy, pretty chaotic few months. And I definitely want to just take a little bit of time

648
01:28:17,029 --> 01:28:23,779
and spend time with people that I want to spend some time with, friends, family. There's, there's

649
01:28:23,779 --> 01:28:29,420
a lot of catching up to do, I think. So I'm going to, after this, just kind of take off for a little

650
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:45,960
bit. When is Battleaxe? You'll see. You'll see. But yeah, I think this is getting to the end.

651
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:48,920
Oh, this is the best singing. That's right. We did best singing, worst singing, and then they

652
01:28:48,920 --> 01:29:03,560
actually came on and did their routine. I'm just saying. I'm just saying. Top shelf vocal. Looking

653
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:21,770
for to hire a group that's phenomenal. I'm telling you. Oh, the misery. Had any of the actors or

654
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:28,010
production crew watched your streams before? Were they unfamiliar? Some of them did. I would say it

655
01:29:28,010 --> 01:29:33,350
was probably 50-50 of people that have actually seen the stream before versus people that kind of

656
01:29:33,350 --> 01:29:40,779
knew that the channel existed. It was probably, I think most people knew what the channel was,

657
01:29:40,779 --> 01:29:48,380
but maybe not to the extent of some of the stuff that was happening. Did Atriok know who you were?

658
01:29:50,949 --> 01:30:00,810
Yeah, I've hung out with Atriok many times in real life. He said, no, he didn't know. Imagine

659
01:30:00,810 --> 01:30:05,050
he just didn't know who I was. Like all the times we've spent in real life together and he just

660
01:30:05,050 --> 01:30:10,630
doesn't even remember. He's like, oh, I've never heard of you. That would be so awful. What would

661
01:30:10,630 --> 01:30:17,770
you even say to something like that? Can you imagine if it's hanging out at least, at least

662
01:30:17,770 --> 01:30:22,810
three times in real life? And this is not just, oh, hey, nice to meet you. It's like, oh, no, no,

663
01:30:22,810 --> 01:30:29,699
we've literally been in the same room for six, seven straight hours together, multiple times.

664
01:30:29,699 --> 01:30:35,800
To have later on, it'd be like, what's your channel again? What's your name? It'd be like,

665
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:47,500
dude, oh, come on. No, no, of course not. He's awesome. I don't know if you knew this,

666
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:52,699
but one of the elves is the best Smash Brothers Melee Donkey Kong player in the world. I did hear

667
01:30:52,699 --> 01:31:14,810
that. I did hear that. That's awesome. In the world. Yeah, it was Ringler. Everyone was so nice, too.

668
01:31:16,819 --> 01:31:24,119
It makes me happy every time doing something like this, just after the effort's all done.

669
01:31:24,119 --> 01:31:39,739
It's just like kind of the smiles on everybody's faces. That's worth it. This stream is loud.

670
01:31:39,739 --> 01:31:52,380
It's not. Volume's fine. You're getting one guide. Okay. Do you feel, do you feel pressure to remember

671
01:31:52,380 --> 01:32:01,659
everybody? Um, I don't, I don't really see it that way. It's kind of just if people show up and

672
01:32:01,659 --> 01:32:06,859
they're having fun and maybe I've heard of them before, maybe not, because I don't really know

673
01:32:06,859 --> 01:32:12,149
very many people in the space. Very recently, the last year or so, I've actually even really

674
01:32:12,149 --> 01:32:18,569
started talking to other streamers. That's pretty new. So I kind of don't really know very much of

675
01:32:18,569 --> 01:32:36,779
the space already. So do you know me? I don't know. Yeah, off-brand connected me with BTS.

676
01:32:36,779 --> 01:32:48,789
That was integral to this whole thing happening. So I thought we were friends. I don't know. I'm

677
01:32:48,789 --> 01:33:00,840
sorry. I gotta be realistic. Is this the first time you worked with BTS? So in a production setting,

678
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:08,020
yes. Not, I mean, I was on Juiced, an episode of XQC's show, and they were doing it. So I've

679
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:15,689
worked kind of with them before, but never as, you know, part of the team to get a show off the

680
01:33:15,689 --> 01:33:20,489
ground. I showed up and was on Juiced and obviously met most of the people that worked on this show,

681
01:33:21,579 --> 01:33:37,510
but didn't, it wasn't part of any production stuff until this one. This is, I'm not punching

682
01:33:37,510 --> 01:33:43,770
somebody, okay? This is, this looks like I'm like, I think we were, I think I was describing

683
01:33:43,770 --> 01:33:54,939
something that I wanted to have happen. No, I'm not punching anybody. He was awesome too.

684
01:33:54,939 --> 01:34:00,810
The Bugleberry video editing was between, I think, a couple different people, because there was the

685
01:34:00,810 --> 01:34:06,119
VFX stuff that was on, there was the actual editing, and it's just, everybody did such a

686
01:34:06,119 --> 01:34:26,680
great fucking job. Practical effects. Dude, stop showing your vacation pics and play Yakuza.

687
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:42,279
That was a good one. Don't time that person out. That was a good one. Hey, the snow! The snow.

688
01:34:43,079 --> 01:34:50,729
Here's the thing about the snow. BTS is going to have at least a year or two worth of packing

689
01:34:50,729 --> 01:35:06,409
material, because they're going to just repurpose this. Oh, didn't I, I put this in my, I chewed this

690
01:35:06,409 --> 01:35:12,279
up, didn't I? I did, I picked, I picked up this, I was chewing it, it was on ground. Why did I do that?

691
01:35:12,279 --> 01:35:22,409
I've just, I had like, a memory just kind of unlocked. That was weird. Yeah, and ruining the

692
01:35:22,409 --> 01:35:40,729
puzzle too. Yeah, I did. Was that not on camera? Was it not on camera? It was, it was, okay. Now,

693
01:35:40,729 --> 01:35:50,970
that's my desktop background. I haven't changed my desktop background since Windows 7 came out,

694
01:35:50,970 --> 01:36:11,770
okay? Just for you to know. Why? I don't know, because I don't, when I get on the computer,

695
01:36:11,770 --> 01:36:16,920
I go. It's time to do whatever I'm going to do. And it's not, I don't have any time to look at my

696
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:26,619
background. It's just, as long as it's just an unoffensive thing. Okay, mountains or a beach

697
01:36:26,619 --> 01:36:32,460
or water. Just no, no, nothing going on. Just something that I don't, I just don't even need

698
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:37,619
to look at it. I usually turn my computer on and within five seconds of it booting,

699
01:36:37,619 --> 01:36:48,420
a program is open taking up the screen anyways. I just don't, I just don't look at the background

700
01:36:48,420 --> 01:36:53,800
and I don't think about it. Yeah, I used to change my background, but then I would be lazy

701
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:59,180
and it would be wallpaper for a game that came out four years ago. Or you know, no, no, not even

702
01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:03,500
that. Like wallpaper for a DLC that came out. And it's like, that's not even relevant anymore. And

703
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:11,930
I just spend so much time. I think the last time, honestly, I think it was Reaper of Souls came up

704
01:37:11,930 --> 01:37:16,329
and I was like, oh yeah, I'm going to put that angel as a background and stay there for like

705
01:37:16,329 --> 01:37:29,260
three years or something. And I just, I was like, why do I have this elves playing in the snow?

706
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:38,310
Of course they are. There's bugleberry hanging out with some dogs. I think some of you have seen

707
01:37:38,310 --> 01:37:57,750
this already. Not a real PC, fake PC type loud. There's, there's their script for the engineers.

708
01:37:57,750 --> 01:38:12,970
Not a real PC, fake PC type loudly. Just, hey, pretty good. Hey, pretty good. Yeah, this is

709
01:38:12,970 --> 01:38:22,810
obviously, this is the off-brand group. There's bugleberry's cookies. Don't leak the script.

710
01:38:22,810 --> 01:38:30,149
Jerma, are you bugleberry? I mean, that's impossible considering he's in the room right now.

711
01:38:30,149 --> 01:38:39,460
That's not possible. Pretty good hair here. Pretty good hairline. That's well lit too. That's a light

712
01:38:39,460 --> 01:38:48,699
beaming down on the top slash back of my head. But no, this is a good moment. Why did you not,

713
01:38:48,699 --> 01:38:55,579
why did you give them fake computers? Because I didn't want a real computer there. They're just

714
01:38:55,579 --> 01:39:02,779
supposed to be pretending to be hacking and engineering, right? If there was a real computer

715
01:39:02,859 --> 01:39:07,270
there, they would have been opening up random stuff. You know, they would press like Windows

716
01:39:07,829 --> 01:39:14,520
space, like G or something and open up like the help menu. No, it was just, there's nothing there.

717
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:30,229
You look pretty tall here. Sick. I like this picture. They're all tall. It feels good though.

718
01:39:32,359 --> 01:39:39,720
Finally, putting to rest the rumors that we are the same person. Finally, putting those rumors to

719
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:58,569
rest. Magic is real and I just proved it. There's no way, there's not a chance that during the live

720
01:39:58,569 --> 01:40:05,369
portion of this stream, somebody was being a body double and put the costume on to do some of those

721
01:40:05,369 --> 01:40:10,779
routines to make that seem like a real thing. Out of the question completely. There's no way.

722
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:27,319
Not possible. Magic is real. Don't believe the haters. And then here's the crew. Tons of people

723
01:40:27,319 --> 01:40:39,130
here did a lot of stuff that you didn't see. BTS and some of their connections, they was great.

724
01:40:39,529 --> 01:40:57,979
I'm so happy with it. Three of you are doing the same pose. Yeah, it's a picture. What's with you

725
01:40:57,979 --> 01:41:03,979
guys and where hands are in photos? You know what I mean? Okay, can't go like this. Can't go like

726
01:41:03,979 --> 01:41:10,300
this. Can't go like this. Can't go like this. You don't stand like, come on. People have different

727
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:22,779
ways that they stand in pictures. Did you increase the elves pay? It's funny you say that. I actually

728
01:41:22,779 --> 01:41:29,300
a day or two ago sent a message to the group, to like the BTS group. It was like, hey,

729
01:41:29,300 --> 01:41:32,659
let's actually do that. We should actually do like, we should give them an extra.

730
01:41:33,989 --> 01:41:47,640
I said that like a few days ago, so it's fun. Five times zero is still zero. How did they even get

731
01:41:47,640 --> 01:42:04,569
this in such a short amount of time? And then one more. And that's it. I accidentally used my Prime

732
01:42:04,569 --> 01:42:12,020
sub and I'm now a founder for the RealGermaChristmas channel. Yeah, how many people subbed

733
01:42:12,020 --> 01:42:26,409
to that channel? Could you have? I wonder what happens to those subs going just, all right,

734
01:42:26,409 --> 01:42:42,119
well then whatever. That'll help pay for the stream. How come everyone's pointing? I don't know. I

735
01:42:42,119 --> 01:42:47,369
think one person did it and then we all did it. Like, yeah, we're, let's go. I don't know. Why

736
01:42:48,729 --> 01:42:56,229
did we all start pointing? I think it was like, number one? I don't know. Why did we point? Did I

737
01:42:56,229 --> 01:43:02,220
start going like this? Or am I following somebody here? I wonder who the first person was to hold

738
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:25,289
their finger up. Mario post looking ass? Mario? That's actually fucking perfect. Mario! It's

739
01:43:25,289 --> 01:43:39,210
Super Mario! Oh! I don't know. It was supposed and it was cool and everybody here is awesome.

740
01:43:39,210 --> 01:43:49,939
Nah, hell of a job. And that's it for the year. I'll hang up for a little bit longer. Anybody have

741
01:43:49,939 --> 01:43:54,729
any more questions about it? I don't want to give every single thing away because I feel like it's

742
01:43:54,729 --> 01:44:01,420
more fun that way, but I gave a lot away. Switch between the two images really fast.

743
01:44:01,420 --> 01:44:26,090
Yahoo! Oh my god. Was Puzzle Girl scripted? No. Before we started the stream, I genuinely went in

744
01:44:26,090 --> 01:44:34,119
there and just walked around for maybe 15, 20 minutes and just was talking about stuff to do

745
01:44:34,119 --> 01:44:40,460
in here and said, you know what? You guys are kind of free to do whatever you want. As long as, I mean,

746
01:44:40,460 --> 01:44:46,600
obviously gave them a list of rules to follow for the grand scheme of things, right? But they were

747
01:44:46,600 --> 01:45:02,760
able to creatively just kind of have fun, just do whatever. Was the face paint scripted? No.

748
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:09,779
Atrioc just kind of showed up with that. I think he found it somewhere. And I thought that was one

749
01:45:09,779 --> 01:45:15,619
of those ice packs. So I thought he was icing my cheekbones. I was like, yeah, yeah, so come on.

750
01:45:15,619 --> 01:45:19,220
You're going to come over here. I'm going to be sitting and you're going to give me snacks. You're

751
01:45:19,220 --> 01:45:24,500
going to grab a bottle of water, hyping me up, you know, maybe put some ice pack on my face,

752
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:29,460
like as if I just got punched in the face during boxing. And that's what I thought that was. So he

753
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:42,460
just put it on. I was like, okay, that's what this is. Do you think next year you'll fail as if you

754
01:45:42,460 --> 01:45:51,430
have to top the production quality? No, I don't think like that. I think that can intrude your

755
01:45:51,430 --> 01:46:00,260
brain a lot. And if it has to be bigger and better every single time, you eventually hit a point of

756
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:09,180
no return where nothing can happen now because you've gone too far. So it's just if I have

757
01:46:09,260 --> 01:46:17,899
something that I think is a fun idea, I'll just do it. That's pretty much it. There's no rhyme

758
01:46:17,899 --> 01:46:24,840
or reason to it. There's no special quota that I want to hit or special amount of money that

759
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:31,220
something has to cost or how many people have to be involved. If it sounds fun, I'll do it.

760
01:46:31,220 --> 01:46:37,210
And sometimes those things can happen very quickly. There are a couple of ideas that I

761
01:46:37,210 --> 01:46:42,630
want to do this coming year that are not going to be huge, huge, big, big events that require

762
01:46:42,630 --> 01:46:52,439
tons of people, but they're there. Maybe they will be. I don't know. Are you going to upload

763
01:46:52,439 --> 01:46:57,100
these somewhere? I think a few of the highlight channels are starting to get the footage and

764
01:46:57,100 --> 01:47:02,520
they're starting to upload them. The second channel, I think I'll have to get in touch with

765
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:11,720
the second channel people. Something's wanting to be perfect prevents it from happening. It's

766
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:15,560
better to half-ass something than to not do anything. Well, I don't think half-ass is the

767
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:23,399
right answer, but you're the first part I think is correct. If everything has to be perfect,

768
01:47:23,399 --> 01:47:30,199
you'll never get anything done. Now, some stuff can be perfect. You can make sure certain aspects

769
01:47:30,199 --> 01:47:38,439
are perfect, but if everything has to be perfect, it will never happen. And you put a lot of undue

770
01:47:38,439 --> 01:47:45,319
stress on a lot of people that are working on it because if from the very get-go, this has to be

771
01:47:45,319 --> 01:47:51,909
perfect. Every single person that you are telling that to or that you're making that kind of aware

772
01:47:51,909 --> 01:47:58,890
that that's what's happening, you put pressure. There's a lot of pressure now to, well, fuck,

773
01:47:58,890 --> 01:48:10,149
I can't screw this up because then I ruined it. Did you have that guy squat there on purpose?

774
01:48:10,149 --> 01:48:24,819
No, nobody's squatting here on purpose. What about Grotto Beasts? Grotto Beasts is done. Let me just

775
01:48:24,819 --> 01:48:34,489
make that clear. Grotto Beasts is done. But because of the scale of that project, there's a lot of

776
01:48:34,489 --> 01:48:43,159
stuff that, and that's been, that project has been in the oven for a long time. And the idea was I

777
01:48:43,159 --> 01:48:50,060
wanted it out for Christmas this year, but it's just, I don't want to just run it out the door.

778
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:55,460
Just to get it out there and release it. A lot of work and a lot of time has gone into it.

779
01:48:55,460 --> 01:49:05,800
And it's, I told you guys this before, that project is, I mean, it's kind of just a huge

780
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:12,729
kind of community oriented project. It's a bunch of stream references. There's a bunch of jokes.

781
01:49:12,729 --> 01:49:18,579
It's a bunch of things that over the last decade or so that we thought were interesting or funny

782
01:49:18,579 --> 01:49:23,590
or whatever. So I want to make sure it's right. And I want to make sure it comes out correctly.

783
01:49:23,670 --> 01:49:34,869
So yeah, it's done when it's done. Not very much longer. Very, very, very short amount of time.

784
01:49:34,869 --> 01:49:39,449
There's a lot going on with that project, but I can promise you this. You'll get it at some

785
01:49:39,449 --> 01:49:55,659
point very soon. Just not in a week. If you want more updates, Grotto Beasts team, you know,

786
01:49:55,659 --> 01:50:00,729
they're working on some cool stuff on the Twitter. Go follow the Twitter. There are card reveals

787
01:50:00,729 --> 01:50:09,819
happening all the time. They've already revealed a lot of cards. Every time Polly makes a post,

788
01:50:10,380 --> 01:50:15,319
she's just excited. She's just like, I can't wait to press the tweet button. Just like,

789
01:50:15,319 --> 01:50:32,630
it's awesome. When are you going to change your pin tweet? That's my New Year's resolution.

790
01:50:32,630 --> 01:50:40,840
Can't wait. Yeah, that's been a long time coming too. Wait, it's actually a playable card game.

791
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:52,859
Yes. I will give a ton of details when I'm ready to do so. It started out, that whole project

792
01:50:52,859 --> 01:50:58,199
started out as just kind of, I was like, wait, that would be kind of fun merch, wouldn't it?

793
01:50:58,279 --> 01:51:05,899
Having kind of cards based on community references and stream stuff and put some

794
01:51:05,899 --> 01:51:11,560
original characters in it. And it was going to be just kind of collectible, just cards.

795
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:18,939
Then I was like, wait a minute, it can be made into an actual game. And we have a game designer

796
01:51:18,939 --> 01:51:27,420
that's been working on it for almost two years. Is it an NFT? No, it's cards. Like, you know,

797
01:51:27,420 --> 01:51:39,350
sorry, I just punched you. Next year, are you going to do the live action Elden Ring thing

798
01:51:40,279 --> 01:51:48,500
similar to Dollhouse? I've said this before. I don't really do, I don't like, I don't want

799
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:56,279
to do sequels. I think I've said that before. I don't want to do a sequel to Dollhouse,

800
01:51:56,279 --> 01:52:05,340
but Dollhouse 2 could just be something else in that same world. I don't want to just do it.

801
01:52:05,340 --> 01:52:12,760
And I know that, and okay, you want me to get real? Okay. Okay, you asked for it. You asked for it.

802
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:22,409
You want me to get real? Marketing and getting support for stuff that is not a concept that's

803
01:52:22,409 --> 01:52:34,340
ever proven is hard. You probably noticed there was no sponsor on this show. There isn't. It's

804
01:52:34,340 --> 01:52:41,779
hard to describe to people in the world of marketing, in the world of, you know, supporting stream

805
01:52:41,779 --> 01:52:47,060
or something, right? I need money for this. It's like, what the fuck are you doing? Why are you

806
01:52:47,060 --> 01:52:58,279
doing that? That's stupid. Or like, that's weird, but okay. Because there's no, look, if I wanted

807
01:52:58,279 --> 01:53:06,840
to do Dollhouse 5, because Dollhouse 2, 3, and 4 have happened already, and they happened in the

808
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:16,010
last six months, then it would be probably very easy. But Dollhouse 2, 3, 4, and 5 would probably

809
01:53:16,010 --> 01:53:23,239
be not very good. It probably wouldn't be good at all. Maybe, depends on what I want to do with it,

810
01:53:23,239 --> 01:53:28,380
or what we want to do. Could it be better? But then that just goes back to the problem that we

811
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:34,520
talked about earlier with, are you concerned that things have to be bigger and better every time?

812
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:38,920
That is the problem with something like a sequel. That is a problem with something like a series on

813
01:53:38,920 --> 01:53:47,850
the same idea. How do you keep it fun? How do you make it so the first one and the second one

814
01:53:47,850 --> 01:54:01,779
are in the same world? Would we just do the same jokes? How do you do more? What do you do?

815
01:54:01,779 --> 01:54:08,180
And that's been the motivation the whole time, has been making sure that something seems like

816
01:54:08,180 --> 01:54:15,539
a fun thing to do, and it's new every time, and it's different every time. So trying to convince

817
01:54:15,539 --> 01:54:24,149
people that shows like this, I think they matter to me a lot, but they're hard to sell to people

818
01:54:24,149 --> 01:54:28,739
because they just don't, it's just like, what are you doing? It's like, oh, but we did Dollhouse.

819
01:54:28,739 --> 01:54:33,960
Do you remember Dollhouse? Yeah, but this isn't Dollhouse. I'm just gonna hack your fucking stream.

820
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:42,470
What are you talking about? Oh, but it's gonna be fun though, I promise. But we don't know that.

821
01:54:42,470 --> 01:54:49,960
We don't know that. This stream could have been awful. We don't know that because we haven't done

822
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:54,729
it before. That's the problem for a lot of people in the marketing world.

823
01:55:04,939 --> 01:55:12,409
Dollhouse 2 is Dollhouse, but it is just a stream of you playing Yakuza. What, in the Dollhouse?

824
01:55:12,409 --> 01:55:27,460
You can go off numbers though. Not really. Not, I mean, not really. You don't need to be in the

825
01:55:27,460 --> 01:55:33,060
Dollhouse. But yeah, a Dollhouse 2 to me, and people have asked this many times, like what

826
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:38,619
would that even be? It would be something like we were just talking about. It would be a different

827
01:55:38,619 --> 01:55:54,579
concept, but in that same world of interaction. Chat, marketing, experts, incoming. But yeah,

828
01:55:54,579 --> 01:56:03,109
to cap that conversation and to kind of put a lid on it, it's still trying to get shows off the

829
01:56:03,109 --> 01:56:13,659
ground and have them financed is still the thing that's not simple. Sometimes you don't need it.

830
01:56:13,659 --> 01:56:19,159
I don't think, honestly, I think a sponsor would have taken it probably away from this show,

831
01:56:19,159 --> 01:56:26,710
don't you think? I don't think I would have wanted one anyways. And we were talking to people. We

832
01:56:26,710 --> 01:56:33,239
had some lines out there for what this could be. They don't all have to have sponsors on them,

833
01:56:33,239 --> 01:56:41,430
but that needs to come from somewhere. And sometimes when a show is, I mean, I don't want to,

834
01:56:41,430 --> 01:56:46,039
I mean, I sort of want to lay out financing to anybody like, oh, here's all the money.

835
01:56:46,760 --> 01:56:54,300
But shows that cost more than 100, 200 plus thousand dollars, they, you almost need to be

836
01:56:54,300 --> 01:57:02,810
secure. You need to make sure that it's possible. Most of the stuff that you've seen on this channel,

837
01:57:02,810 --> 01:57:10,020
that was a big elaborate kind of show stream, were over, over a hundred thousand dollars to do

838
01:57:11,210 --> 01:57:19,539
for each one. Not all of them, but most of them, some of them much higher. So it is,

839
01:57:20,739 --> 01:57:27,140
it is a struggle sometimes. And look, I don't have to, it's very easy for you to do back in

840
01:57:27,140 --> 01:57:31,220
the napkin math on this channel. This channel makes a good amount of money. This channel makes

841
01:57:31,220 --> 01:57:39,670
a lot of money. But even still, it's still, even with that, it's still, and I'll have to say,

842
01:57:40,470 --> 01:57:54,489
I don't want to just, you know, go to fucking zero, right? Just to do this stuff. It can be scary.

843
01:57:54,489 --> 01:58:04,100
But no, it's still a concern. Now, thankfully, there's been, I've done a lot of sponsors this

844
01:58:04,100 --> 01:58:12,739
year. And I think they, I enjoyed myself on them. So I'm happy to do those. But it has to be,

845
01:58:13,300 --> 01:58:20,810
I don't know, I just don't want to fuck it all up. I hope that, if that makes sense.

846
01:58:20,810 --> 01:58:30,539
I don't want to fuck this all up, because it's, you can. And trying to balance money and content,

847
01:58:30,539 --> 01:58:35,819
and I want to still try to be creative, but seeing things to be paid for, I just don't want to fuck

848
01:58:35,819 --> 01:58:45,779
the whole thing up, if I'm honest. And there's been sponsors where I've kind of gone back and

849
01:58:45,779 --> 01:58:56,619
forth and then been like, no, nevermind. But yeah, and I also don't want, here's another thing too,

850
01:58:56,619 --> 01:59:03,539
that I don't want to see. And it's not that I'm, you know, see it or anything, but I also don't

851
01:59:03,539 --> 01:59:12,010
want to put myself in the channel upon a pedestal, because that's a bad idea. I don't want to be this,

852
01:59:12,010 --> 01:59:18,090
oh, everything has to be fucking so good. And oh, wow, I've got to make sure, I don't want to,

853
01:59:18,090 --> 01:59:29,210
you know, you got to be careful. Because this channel, a lot of really nice things are said

854
01:59:29,210 --> 01:59:37,529
about this place. So I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing, and try to do it as good as I can,

855
01:59:37,529 --> 01:59:45,560
and try to do everything the way that I would have always done it. But it can be hard.

856
01:59:47,989 --> 01:59:51,989
Because, you know, when people talk about this space, and people talk about, oh shit, wow, that

857
01:59:51,989 --> 01:59:59,060
was so awesome. Like, that was really fun. But I don't want to fuck it up. And I don't want it to,

858
01:59:59,060 --> 02:00:06,409
like, get, actually get into my brain, and kind of ruin the way that I see this place. If that makes

859
02:00:06,409 --> 02:00:27,560
sense. What about the infomercials? Yeah, we'll watch more infomercials. Of course we will. Nice

860
02:00:27,560 --> 02:00:36,729
lava cake here. Yeah. We need to see, what did you say? We need to see the document of German lore

861
02:00:36,729 --> 02:00:44,250
you sent to the extinguisher. It was, it was, okay. You know what it was? I was in mod chat,

862
02:00:44,250 --> 02:00:49,100
and we were talking about all the things that I didn't do, that I said I was going to do.

863
02:00:49,100 --> 02:00:54,390
And I was like, do you guys have any more shit that I keep lying about? So the mods got together,

864
02:00:54,390 --> 02:00:58,710
and I think some of the community people were tapped into to be like, what have I said that

865
02:00:58,710 --> 02:01:05,909
we can just give this guy? The mods were in on it, by the way. And I don't want, I'm not going to,

866
02:01:05,909 --> 02:01:14,340
I don't want to spoil anything, but who was modding the other stream? I wonder. Interesting.

867
02:01:14,340 --> 02:01:29,539
Who could that be? Random people. Do a Blue's Clues stream. No. But yeah, I know after doing

868
02:01:29,539 --> 02:01:38,899
stuff like this, and when we go over behind the scenes, and you get that kind of, that post fun

869
02:01:38,899 --> 02:01:47,060
thing kind of slow down, where it's like, oh, that was fun. Oh, do you remember when I was there?

870
02:01:47,060 --> 02:02:03,369
That was so fun. Oh, okay. Yeah. I like being involved in stuff like this. And I think the

871
02:02:03,369 --> 02:02:19,000
future of my life, wherever it goes, whatever it is, I hope is in spaces like this. Because I

872
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:29,979
find this to be some of the most fun, and some of the most engaging. And maybe doing some more,

873
02:02:30,619 --> 02:02:37,670
like, creative directing. Maybe start doing more writing, if I can. Come up with some stuff.

874
02:02:38,390 --> 02:02:53,350
Maybe help other people. We're not using this photo, though. The Jerma movie. No, I already

875
02:02:53,350 --> 02:03:02,979
shut that down. I already shut that down. I would, okay, if I had like a five million dollar budget,

876
02:03:02,979 --> 02:03:08,739
a million of it would be blown on having like five hot air balloons take us to set every day.

877
02:03:08,739 --> 02:03:12,659
And it'd be like, why is he doing this? Tell him to stop spending that money. Be like, I have to.

878
02:03:12,659 --> 02:03:27,300
We have to. It's to get everybody into the right mindset. Add another million for hair product.

879
02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:41,800
You just win the lottery. I already did. I already did. You understand? Think about it.

880
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:48,199
I already did. And we could sit here and talk about like, oh, man, like, man, I'm doing big

881
02:03:48,199 --> 02:03:52,220
shows, man, I really wish this would happen. Oh, man, you know, I loved it. I already did hit the

882
02:03:52,220 --> 02:04:01,100
fucking lottery. So whatever happens from here is extra. So because I know that it's a huge,

883
02:04:01,100 --> 02:04:14,550
huge fucking it's very difficult to be able to get into this space. Cheesy Charles. Yeah,

884
02:04:14,550 --> 02:04:32,380
Cheesy Charles is showing up to tell you that. Cheesy Charlie. Dude, bro, I'm crying. Stop being

885
02:04:32,380 --> 02:04:37,800
so sappy already. This is the last time I'm going to see you until the new year. Come on. I'm allowed

886
02:04:37,800 --> 02:04:52,500
to be a little sappy. But no, this is, this is the stuff that I find the most fun. And I would like

887
02:04:52,500 --> 02:05:04,439
to continue to do it. But yeah, not even sappy. Why was I not even sappy? How am I sappy, Steve?

888
02:05:06,010 --> 02:05:09,770
I said, no, I said, fuck. I said, who gives, I, well, what the fuck, right? That's no, it's not

889
02:05:09,770 --> 02:05:19,899
sad. I'm not cheesy anymore. I'm cool. Cheesy fucking Charlie. Yeah, you think so? I just swore

890
02:05:19,899 --> 02:05:25,909
a few times. All right. That's going to be it. I was thinking about playing something, but I got a

891
02:05:25,909 --> 02:05:34,409
lot of stuff to do. So let's talk about some stuff very quickly going into the new year.

892
02:05:34,409 --> 02:05:40,149
Going to be bringing back. We're going to be going back to the basics a little bit.

893
02:05:40,149 --> 02:05:47,319
There's no major, major things planned for the month of January, really into February. We're

894
02:05:47,319 --> 02:05:52,569
going to be going besides Grotto Beast, obviously, which is going to be a huge deal. I'm going to go

895
02:05:52,569 --> 02:05:59,420
back to kind of normal streams, going to bring back some more chill streams, maybe play some games

896
02:05:59,420 --> 02:06:13,079
and go from there. So in the new year, you sound like a teacher, whatever. Yeah, there's potentially

897
02:06:13,079 --> 02:06:18,760
some Elden Ring stuff to do. There's lots of games that I didn't play the last few weeks because I've

898
02:06:18,760 --> 02:06:27,479
just been very busy. So yeah, we'll get back to it. Back to the basics. Can we do some meme react

899
02:06:27,479 --> 02:06:37,699
video? Maybe. But yeah, those are my thoughts. I think it was a great way to end the year.

900
02:06:37,779 --> 02:06:45,380
Everybody did a phenomenal job. I'm very, very happy about it. And I feel good. It feels good.

901
02:06:45,380 --> 02:06:54,760
And that's pretty much all there is to it. Vampire Survivors. Yeah, I have a very, very,

902
02:06:54,760 --> 02:07:05,079
I have a confession. I played the DLC already and it was very fun. I'm sorry. I didn't have time.

903
02:07:05,079 --> 02:07:12,630
I'm sorry. I didn't have time. By the way, very quickly, did you guys know,

904
02:07:14,069 --> 02:07:21,689
somebody please correct me because I cannot believe this. Vampire Survivors is on iOS now

905
02:07:21,689 --> 02:07:33,189
and it's free. Is that correct? I'm trying to find the catch. It's just for free. Full game is

906
02:07:33,189 --> 02:07:42,550
for free. It's free. The whole thing. There's no catches. It's just a free video game on iOS

907
02:07:42,550 --> 02:08:00,550
right now. Is there ads on it? I don't think so. Are you sure? I haven't seen any. How long

908
02:08:00,550 --> 02:08:20,579
did I play it for? What do you say this? I'm going to be bat chested. Stop. It's ads to revive.

909
02:08:21,619 --> 02:08:25,880
Only ads are there. Yeah, there are ads, but it's free. Who cares? The only ads are if you

910
02:08:25,880 --> 02:08:32,229
die and want to respawn for like extra coins and stuff. Who gives a shit? That's fucking,

911
02:08:32,229 --> 02:08:38,779
the whole game is free. The catch is you have to play it on iOS. Pepe laugh.

912
02:08:38,779 --> 02:08:51,659
Can we get one more cat puke to end the year? No. All right. I'll see you guys later. Thanks

913
02:08:51,659 --> 02:08:57,260
for watching. I know the last few streams have been just kind of hanging out and then the Christmas

914
02:08:57,260 --> 02:09:02,810
thing, but we'll get back to it in the new year. I'll see you guys soon. Take care of yourselves.

915
02:09:02,810 --> 02:09:09,180
Have a great holiday. Have an awesome new year's. I probably won't see you. I'll be back

916
02:09:09,180 --> 02:09:19,420
probably on, probably the second or third of January is probably when I'll turn the stream

917
02:09:19,420 --> 02:09:23,930
back on and we'll just kind of go back to normal. Yeah. Merry Christmas. Happy holidays. Happy new

918
02:09:23,930 --> 02:09:33,189
year. Thanks for playing along on that stream. I really could have gone either way and I'm glad

919
02:09:33,189 --> 02:09:39,850
that for the most part people were having fun and playing along and even after the two streams

920
02:09:39,850 --> 02:09:55,979
converging, I'm just happy to see everybody had a good time. So see you later. Take care and let's

921
02:09:55,979 --> 02:10:12,199
do this. Thanks for the subs. Didn't you Lala? At least you promised. Lala. See? I'm keeping my

922
02:10:12,199 --> 02:10:28,840
promises now. Was that the real Santa? That was a real Santa. That was a real Santa. That was Santa.

923
02:10:28,840 --> 02:10:36,680
Why are you even asking that question? Okay. Now I actually do the hundred subs. Oh shit. Yeah.

924
02:10:36,840 --> 02:10:46,300
I actually don't think I can right now. All right. On the first stream, the first stream

925
02:10:46,300 --> 02:10:50,939
of the new year, tell me to do that because I will. That's new year's resolution. We're going to fix

926
02:10:50,939 --> 02:11:10,680
some of these. We're going to right some of these wrongs from last year. Please bro. Yeah. Again,

927
02:11:10,680 --> 02:11:20,810
huge thanks to Offbrand, to Ludwig, Atrioc, obviously Nick, Stans. They were great to work

928
02:11:20,810 --> 02:11:32,579
with. I'd love to work on stuff with them again. BTS. Everybody was so good. All the set design.

929
02:11:33,460 --> 02:11:50,539
It was just so good. I'm so thankful and so grateful. Yeah. The Extinguisher. There's so

930
02:11:50,539 --> 02:12:03,579
many people to thank and just so many people that contributed a lot. But yeah. Have a great holiday.

931
02:12:03,579 --> 02:12:13,819
Can we get one more scorn for the year? Sure. Let me figure out how I'm going to do that.

932
02:13:09,100 --> 02:13:26,180
See you guys later. See you in the new year.
