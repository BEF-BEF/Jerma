1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:07,429
What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? Wow, German985 is playing my favorite game,

2
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:15,429
Watch Dogs Allegiance. Oh, I can't believe it's out now. It's only $59.99, $99.99, or $119. Why was

3
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:29,399
there? What's $119? I don't understand. Is this a $120 edition of this game? What do you get?

4
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:51,670
Hold on, I gotta move my mic. It's low from the auto stream. What do you get with a $120 edition?

5
00:00:53,189 --> 00:01:00,619
A little figurine that's made out of plywood? What do you get? Tell me. Remember your $1080 is

6
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:07,349
not going to be powerful enough. No, it is. I'm good. I can turn the graphics down if I have to.

7
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:23,909
It's for skins? Oh, I'm going to be fine. $1080 is fine. Yeah, that's fine. We had 10 community subs

8
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:34,469
from Aggression Cow. Thank you, Aggression Cow, for the 10 community subs. $1080 Andy. That's me.

9
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:47,480
I just used the $1080. That's what I do. Make sure you're on DX11. Oh, I just opened the game.

10
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:56,250
Is that? I don't think I even have DX12. I think I'm going to be fine. So yeah, this is Watch Dogs

11
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:04,920
Legion. I know it's shocking. I know a lot of you guys are just choking on your grapes or whatever

12
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:13,580
you're eating right now. Yes, I'm playing a game that came out today. A new game that came out today.

13
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:24,710
Weird. That shit don't happen. Why am I playing this? Well, go over the German 985 checklist,

14
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:33,270
please. Okay. Punch people on sidewalk. That's a box that's checked. Drive a car. That's a box

15
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:42,419
that's checked. Open world. That's a box that's checked. And I can play as old people. That's a

16
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:47,699
bonus secret menu that you didn't even know about. That box is now checked. And I know, look, I'm

17
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:51,139
already going to give you my impression of this game. I haven't played it, but I feel like this

18
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:57,610
is just going to be when I used to play GTA 4 with the pedestrian mod that you could play as

19
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:07,449
any pedestrian. I feel like it's going to be the same game. I'm going in with an open mind though.

20
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:17,750
He's going through his daily checklist. It's just a shitty version of that. No, it's the GTA 4

21
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:27,370
pedestrian mod, but somebody modded in phones like hacking phones. And it looks beautiful on a GTX

22
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:41,530
1080, I'll tell you. That's a sponsor. It's not a sponsor. All right, let's just go. I'm going to

23
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,389
stall. I don't have to put a VR headset on. We can just go. There's also something interesting

24
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:54,569
this game has, which, why don't we take a look? This game has permadeath, and I'm assuming that

25
00:03:54,569 --> 00:04:04,740
you can have a bunch of people that are playing in your group, and if they die, they're dead forever.

26
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:14,550
I'm going to put, why not? My justification of playing on normal is to have permadeath on.

27
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:20,410
I'm not playing on hard. No, we're playing normal with permadeath. That's your, that's the

28
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:33,509
compromise here. Please play the game, Mr. Streamer Man. I am. Are you ready? Are you guys ready for

29
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:41,540
Watch Dogs Legion? It's gonna be a 10 minute stream. Why, you think I'm gonna not like the

30
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:49,910
game that much? Why do I look like, I sound like, I look loud. Am I, am I really loud?

31
00:04:51,860 --> 00:05:04,790
I look very loud. No? I look loud. All right, let's go. Do you want to start the game with

32
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:10,019
these settings? Permadeath is on. Permadeath mode can be turned off in the options. Yeah, I'm good.

33
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:19,240
Let's go. Hacking computers. Files. I'm checking, I'm checking on it. I'm checking on it. Yeah,

34
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,370
just give me a minute. I'm checking on it. Yeah, what these people don't know is it takes like

35
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:28,230
three months to hack into like some bank account. Oh, you want to get into bank account? Yeah,

36
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:35,019
let me check on that right now. I got it. Pre-recorded hacking sequences.

37
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:55,689
All that music, art and multiculturalism and the world's oldest underground, the tube,

38
00:05:55,689 --> 00:06:03,610
the class of cities really top shelf stuff. Raving rabbits. To tear it all down.

39
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:10,980
Wait, did it say it was 12, London's 12,000 years old? How is that possible when the earth is only

40
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:30,310
like 3000 years old? What, what are you talking, what do you mean? A light bulb just went like

41
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:38,980
and broke in my head. Wait, what? Ow. Thoughts. Ow. Critical thinking hurts.

42
00:06:41,139 --> 00:07:01,370
Is that me? Oh, cool. All right. Ubisoft presents not raving rabbits. Resident sleeper. I'm in.

43
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:04,889
I'm in. I told you. I'm in. Me too.

44
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:15,050
That's rich, Bagley. The government would sooner arrest us for trying to help,

45
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:19,370
but actually do something useful. This one on our own. Carefully, Dalton.

46
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:23,930
Actually, are you detecting a little worry in Sabine's voice? Brilliant. Asking the

47
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:30,490
computer about feelings. This explains so much. Shut it, you two, and get to work. There she is.

48
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,490
This game is going to suck. Well, you can't say that yet. We haven't even walked around.

49
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:43,750
Let's check that 1080. Okay. Hey, guys, 1080 seems to be holding up pretty well.

50
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:54,259
C to crouch. Okay. Press F near an unaware enemy to perform a takedown. If I hit Q,

51
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:04,069
I vibrate his phone and I can punch him right in the fucking face. Nice. That'll definitely

52
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:08,230
hurt your hand. Your hand probably broke in four places. I hate that bullshit. It's so stupid. If

53
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:13,430
you punch somebody in the face, your hand breaks. Why doesn't it cut to this guy in a fucking

54
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:22,279
hospital bed for a week? Investigate the threat to parliament. That's a weak hand.

55
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:33,539
If they don't shoot me, I won't shoot them. How's that? Weak bones? All right. Operation

56
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:42,299
Westminster. Okay, that's vault. Is there a hitman thing where I can see through walls?

57
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:47,529
Isn't it permadeath on? If I die with the main characters, does the game just end?

58
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:59,820
Detective vision. Wait, sneak. Hold on a locked door to reveal the link to the closed circuit

59
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:07,929
terminal to unlock the door. All right, be careful. There's people over here. Okay. Oh,

60
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:19,419
just like in Half-Life. Hijack. Use to hijack camera and scout the area. Hijack. Nice. Cool.

61
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:29,929
Press Q when aiming at an explosive device to use the arm trap hack. Okay, that's been armed. What

62
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:41,700
is it? Wait, no. Arm this one. Wait, what? It didn't say explode. It just said arm. It's really

63
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:49,460
cool to see that they still think this mechanic is cool like eight years later. Okay, let's go.

64
00:09:56,629 --> 00:10:00,149
Wait, no, don't walk over there. This is going to explode if I go over there. It's permadeath. I

65
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:11,129
can't die. All right, sneak. Wait, arm trap. Now when he walks into that, he's going to explode.

66
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:27,500
Is he? Why is all this stuff so dangerous? Why? Why is every single thing we have

67
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:36,940
surrounding us able to explode? Wait, wait, wait. There's two people here. All right, arm this.

68
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:41,820
Watch. Hey, guys, watch this. I'm a hacker. I'm going to make the soda machine explode when the

69
00:10:41,820 --> 00:11:05,059
guy walks towards it. Am I not? I mean, what are you doing? Deadsec as fuck. All right, turn off the

70
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:08,740
power. We've got loads of Deadsec gear down here. And why don't you suppose that is?

71
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:14,940
What? How did they get their hands on it? I don't know. Oh, hack. Or someone wants to make it look

72
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:22,700
like Deadsec was here. Shit. What happened? Oh. All right, they think. Oh, I got, by the way,

73
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,980
one really important thing about this story. I don't care. I never did care. I don't give a shit

74
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,820
about anything they're talking about. I played an hour of Watch Dogs 1 and like two hours of

75
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,379
Watch Dogs 2. I don't care about anything they're saying. I have no idea what's happening.

76
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:47,379
Is that bad that I just played for like three hours total? Is that bad? Does it matter? Oh,

77
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:57,480
wait. It's OK. I'll get a TLDR. What happens? I only played Watch Dogs enough to like drive

78
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,279
over somebody on the sidewalk, hack a traffic light and have a car crash happen. And then I went,

79
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:11,190
yeah, I stopped playing. Distract. Wait, where's there a fuck me? The entire place is rigged to

80
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:26,070
blow. It is? It covered near a wall. I got one right here. AI doesn't swear.

81
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:39,299
Why would you program AI to swear? All right, we got to reach the House of Commons. I'm just

82
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:44,759
going to walk around. Oh, fuck. What do I do? I got to distract this guy. All right. Distract.

83
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:57,860
What? I don't have enough power to hack. OK, I have enough power to go into a webcam and look

84
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,899
at somebody, but not enough to like hack their phone. All right, I get it. Let's just walk.

85
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:10,009
You're out of hacking mana. The AI is probably stupid. It's stupid. Look.

86
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:33,240
Look. I'm good. This guy's chasing you like a baton. Unavailable under pursuit? What? I'm

87
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:52,340
good. I'm just hiding in the trash. They can't see me. Unavailable. Where's my? All right, so go.

88
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:59,700
Move on. Yeah, I know. The 100 foot radius in a circle around you is clear. You might

89
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:09,899
want to check somewhere else. Oh, no, I know what they're doing. They will. Oh, OK. No, I'm good.

90
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:14,460
It's all right. I just screamed. They were just pretending to check and going over the microphone

91
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:23,379
over the radio like tell the supervisor like, yeah, it was just make believe. Oh, what do I do?

92
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:32,309
Looks I'm going to have to hack into this. Oh, come on. What about hacking? Why can I hack the

93
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:46,340
door? This guy dies in the House of Commons in like five minutes. Whoever these men in black

94
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:50,899
are, they've got blast bollocks to set up in the center of government. I get it. I know. I know.

95
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:53,860
I'm going to die in like two minutes. And that's what it's like. Oh, you think this is the main

96
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,059
character would have been like kind of a cool reveal if they just didn't spend the last like

97
00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:02,659
full year talking about how cool it was to play as every character in the world.

98
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:14,659
All right. Reach the detonator. All right. Well, that was unnecessary, but it's OK.

99
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:26,970
This is a minigame. What do I have to do? Oh, it's a cut scene. And it's definitely live.

100
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:31,049
Bagley, I'm going to need some help with this. Yes, you are. But sadly, I'm locked out.

101
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:40,740
Well, we don't have a chance. Bagley. Wait, wait. His name is Bagley. You're full of surprises.

102
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:53,899
Be quick about it. Not like in portal. I mean, oh, yeah, me too. Bombs have just armed themselves.

103
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:58,059
Well, that may complicate matters. All right. Hey, those of you that are playing

104
00:15:58,059 --> 00:16:04,379
the drinking game, that's three times vaporizing. So fair warning. Expect this to draw some attention

105
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:13,929
your way, Dalton. Oh, I'm cancer. Company at our back door. Dalton, we've got some heat here.

106
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:18,090
Emma, why? What? How long is this going to take Bagley? Depends how often you interrupt me with

107
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:24,809
questions. All right, everyone faces on guns out faces on. Oh, I can't wait to put I'm going to

108
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:37,129
pick my favorite mask. All right. I can pick a mask. No, no, no. You're not supposed to save me.

109
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:49,980
You're supposed to save her. They're on me. I'll try and hold them off.

110
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:59,659
Okay. Survive the ambush. Oh, shit. Oh, sorry. I didn't do it. Am I supposed to kill these guys?

111
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:34,539
Okay. So I have to what do I do? Okay. Um, it's still on. This is slow mo effect.

112
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:49,079
Well, this is a really long slow mo. Turn off the computer. I have to do this. This sucks. Why? What

113
00:17:49,079 --> 00:18:11,990
the hell happened? Press Control Alt Delete. Oh, I'm it. I'm it. Oh, I got booted. I got booted.

114
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:21,769
I can't believe I have to control. I have to put hard reset this. Watch Dogs Legion end task.

115
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:35,000
Give me a fucking break. Where's that going to pop up? Where's that? What's that going to do?

116
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,920
Watch Dogs Legion. All right, let's go. That better be an auto save right there.

117
00:18:46,569 --> 00:19:03,079
This is so stupid. Oh, well. Now I can't even open the game. Is it opening? Hello? It says the

118
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:25,480
game is running. I ended the task. You just got bogged. What is going on? Open. 10 minute stream.

119
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,200
No, no, it's opening. It's just taking a wicked long time. I have all the new driver. I need a

120
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:43,420
computer. I can't like pretend to play these new AAA games. All right. It only took two minutes

121
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:49,980
to open. This is what it felt like when you used to have a regular HDD and you turn on windows and

122
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,920
it would take like seven minutes before you got to your desktop. Fuck. I need a new computer.

123
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:07,609
All right. Here we go. Big bits. Oh shit. There are big bits. All right. This is from tapeworm

124
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:16,759
corn dog. Holy shit. That's disgusting. Thanks for the that's a hundred bucks. 10,000 bits from

125
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:22,420
tapeworm corn dog. And they say, thanks for fucking showing everybody my cool username.

126
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:28,859
Actually, that's not even my username. My username is Royale coming my way. I don't know.

127
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:35,559
Anyways, they say, hi Jerma. Love you and chat. Been watching for like eight years and today's

128
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:39,400
my 19th birthday. Happy fucking birthday. Wanted to give it a little back and say thanks for being

129
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:45,799
the master of comedy. I won't be here for long because I exclusively watch VODs. All right. Also,

130
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:57,819
can we get some Jerma disgusts for my username? Yeah, I gave you a huge one. Oh fuck. I completely

131
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:03,829
blew my cover here. I turned it on for a minute to make sure that the 1080 could handle it.

132
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:13,900
Here we are. No, seriously, tapeworm. That's a ton of money. Thanks for the fucking hundred bucks.

133
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:23,000
It still couldn't handle it. I swear to God, if it crashes again, I'm going to be very upset.

134
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:33,140
But the game didn't even crash. We still get an audio. Oh, lower this. All right. I'm going to

135
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:39,369
lower the settings. That's not a bad idea. Lower the graphics settings. Oh, great. And I get to be

136
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:49,369
the last person that loads up in League. Everyone has to sit there and fucking watch. Like, holy shit.

137
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:59,960
Oh my God. Don't even fucking tell me. What a town. History around every corner. God damn it. All

138
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:07,210
right. Hold on. Turn the graphics down. Video. All right. Yeah. FPS limit. Field of view. I can't

139
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:15,460
turn that up. Quality. All right. Graphics quality. High. Geometry. High. Environment. High. Texture

140
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:22,099
medium. Filtering. You can't even tell a difference. OK. Look it. This is like going

141
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:27,380
to the eye doctor and you have no idea which one looks better. It doesn't even matter.

142
00:22:28,099 --> 00:22:35,059
Low. Shadows. OK. These actually look better. No, they don't. Those look terrible. It looks like

143
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:46,309
there's a giant spiderweb over New York. Oh, London. Wherever we are. Headlight shadow. Reflections.

144
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:55,019
But somebody point out the difference. Turn them off. Who cares? Motion blur. Get out of here.

145
00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:59,660
Depth of field. Get out of here. Ambient occlusion. Nobody wants that. Everyone turns it

146
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:04,119
off. That's the first thing everybody does when they open up any video game. They turn this off.

147
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:12,420
Uh, subsurface scattering. I feel like this is just a made up word that they can just have

148
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:18,599
a toggle here. What is it doing? It's scattering the subsurface? It looks all right. I guess it

149
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:27,700
looks OK. Ray Tracer. I don't have that. I can't do that. Temporal upscaling. All right. I'm good.

150
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:46,890
Let's go. Dude. Oh, you know, playing a game at launch. Launch bugs. Launch like problems.

151
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:55,019
It's OK. Whatever, man. This is what happens. Playing at launch. By the way, it is refreshing.

152
00:23:55,019 --> 00:24:06,150
It's just taking a while. Veto it. No, I can't. Are we serious? No, not yet. Go play 3DS. I'm not

153
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:19,500
playing 3DS. I have to play one AAA game a year. I'm allowed to. OK, here we go. I'm in. Veto.

154
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:25,220
I'm not vetoing. Let's go. We're here. I have. I've lowered the graphics. I'm ready. I'm just

155
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,420
going to speed run this part. I'm running. I'm just going to run through this part because I

156
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:35,299
don't care. You're not vetoing. We are. Yeah, but don't you understand? I have like I have the

157
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:44,009
voting power of like a million of you. I just say we're going and that's what we do. That's a

158
00:24:44,009 --> 00:25:00,920
dictator. I mean, aren't all streams like dictatorships? No, yes. You're a tyrant.

159
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:13,190
OK, here we go. Welcome to Watch Dogs. I'm your host, Jerma. And thank you. And thank you to

160
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:28,309
Ubisoft for making such a cool game. And thank you. Big thanks. Thank you. No, no, this is not

161
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:39,690
sponsored. I just said thank you for making a cool game. Go. All right, I'm in. I'm in. I'm in. I'm

162
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:46,710
in. Let's go. For real, I'm in. It's time to move. Go. Speed run. I'm not stopping for anything.

163
00:25:49,579 --> 00:25:57,990
Wait, why did I just Medusa that guy? What happened? If they don't shoot me, I won't shoot them.

164
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:11,019
How's that? I just think spit in that guy's face. Let's go. Oh, look, I don't know. What do I do?

165
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:23,430
That hurt you more than it hurt me. I feel like I just had a football in my hand.

166
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:42,500
What the fuck was that Metal Gear Solid bullshit? Good. Turn it on. I've got loads of dead set gear

167
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:49,059
down here. I don't care. Leave me alone. Who are these men in black anyway? Nothing identifying.

168
00:26:49,059 --> 00:27:13,480
I suspect that's by design. Disrupt. All right, we're good. We're on pace. Okay.

169
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,819
The entire place is rigged to blow.

170
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:28,599
RDX nitrogen. Enough to level parliament. Analyze. Wait, I didn't do this last time. Let me do this

171
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:32,839
first. But there's a device streaming a fuck load of encrypted data from the floor above you.

172
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:38,440
Fuck. Yeah, that fits the bill on my way. Is that not the detonator? No, but it's a transmitter

173
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,839
sending a signal to a device on the floor above us. Safe to assume that would be the detonator

174
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:51,160
we're looking for. Stage dead set propaganda all around the bombs. This is not how you're

175
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,920
supposed to play. This is going to blow up parliament and hang it on us. Not if you get

176
00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:13,750
to that detonator first. Did you see me? What? No, don't him. Okay, we're good. I did it. It only took

177
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:25,269
me three seconds. He should have tried to open it, picked up his phone, held it over to it,

178
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:28,309
and it didn't work. And he should have looked right at the camera and gone like, oh, man.

179
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:44,250
Yep. Okay, here we go. Save the game. I can't. It's just it's permanently auto saving. All right,

180
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:51,059
I'm going to arm a trap. Let's make sure this doesn't hurt us. Arm trap. Interact. Here we go.

181
00:28:51,059 --> 00:29:00,039
It's time to shoot. Headshot. Don't. I'm not going to shoot the guy the same way. All right,

182
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:20,730
here we go. Ready? All right, your way out. Let's go. Why is the guy screaming?

183
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:57,670
We're good. Three. That's three. Three. Oh, X. Oh, you can. Look at this. 53%. Flashbang.

184
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:05,880
Flashbang. How do I throw it? Oh, I think it's a recharge.

185
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:23,299
Why do I feel like I'm playing Left 4 Dead right now? This is payday. Get on. Get on? What?

186
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:35,369
No crash. We're good. Deactivate. Sick.

187
00:30:35,849 --> 00:30:39,289
On the left, one of them is the receiver. You need to pull the controller wire.

188
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:47,400
Are you fucking kidding me? No, I'm fucking not. No fucking. Fuck. Which one is this? Fuck. Now,

189
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,240
don't. Dalton, don't. Fuck. Don't pull that one. Oh, fuck.

190
00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:04,099
See, that wasn't so bad, was it? Why'd they all mask up? They didn't even go anywhere.

191
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:12,009
What was that for? Everybody mask up. We're just gonna stay here. Well, what the fuck am I looking

192
00:31:12,009 --> 00:31:16,809
at?

193
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,500
Should I go get a bomb?

194
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:45,960
Oh, they knew where our hideout was. It was a mall.

195
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:58,950
Fuck. It was a mall. It was probably me. To the roof. Wait, pick up ammo?

196
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:08,490
We're being raided? Oh, well, Sabine, sing the raid song.

197
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:17,990
I need him for the transmit. Let's press V to scan the area and reveal cameras to hack.

198
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:25,349
Okay, I'll do it the old-fashioned way. Wipe him. Yes, wipe me. Do it, Sabine,

199
00:32:25,349 --> 00:32:29,029
and get the hell out of there. Okay. Fuck. Hack. Download that. Whatever it is.

200
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:39,019
Okay. Hack, he's down. You're on your own. Hack, whatever this is, too. What is this?

201
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:50,420
What are we doing? I promise. Okay. Am I in somebody's iPad? Or did I get it?

202
00:32:51,299 --> 00:33:01,079
I got the code, right? Yeah, I downloaded the code. Hey, hey! What happened? I didn't do

203
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:13,130
anything. No, no, no. Get down. All right, you stun him and then you shoot him in the head.

204
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:21,849
Why is that person... That person's like super... What was it? Marshall in World of Warcraft

205
00:33:22,569 --> 00:33:27,059
battleground arena thing? I tried. I forgot what it was. I'm sorry.

206
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:36,250
Why can I not shoot him? Why is that guy so special?

207
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:58,539
Why was that guy special? E, toxicity for encroaching 500 percent. Where are you?

208
00:33:59,099 --> 00:34:17,130
Come on. Defuse. What are all these bombs look like underneath your sink?

209
00:34:17,769 --> 00:34:42,539
Have you ever noticed that? Like plumbing in there. There's not even wires. Who is it?

210
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:47,449
What the fuck are you? Oh, you still think you're here to save London?

211
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:53,210
I'm afraid that's not going to happen. You're here to help us with some important work.

212
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:56,409
Important work? Fire! Oh, drones!

213
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:05,289
Exactly. To save the world. You do know Londoners have died before. The plague,

214
00:35:05,289 --> 00:35:11,210
the great fire, the blitz. There's not much fun. But destruction is always the cure.

215
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:17,849
And it begins today. Zero day. Did anybody else see this? Did anybody else see this big

216
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:24,170
projection of Obi-Wan talking? This is like the Emperor. This is like a 10 million decibel

217
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:37,960
megawatt speaker. It's time for a hard reset. Oh my god. No! Told you he was dead.

218
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:51,670
A series of explosions devastated three sites in London. Authorities are asking residents to remain

219
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:58,070
in their homes as the situation continues to develop. I loved that character. I loved that

220
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:03,510
character. Warners gathered for a series of candle-like vigils that brought closure to

221
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:07,750
thousands of families and indeed to an entire city. You didn't have a chance.

222
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:13,510
London is now laser focused. They attend Downing Street where Nigel Cass, CEO of

223
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:18,949
private military company Albion, received a mandate to secure London. Cass has vowed to

224
00:36:18,949 --> 00:36:24,309
hunt down DedSec. I don't know what's going on. I probably should have played the first two games.

225
00:36:39,429 --> 00:36:45,510
That's not like John Oliver? Oh wait. No, it wouldn't be John Oliver. He didn't go,

226
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:49,909
I don't think I say that Mr Turfill. I don't want you to do it and I don't think that you're very smart.

227
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:25,900
So where do we come in here?

228
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:42,059
What is DedSec bad or is DedSec good?

229
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:53,420
Willing to expound those theories on camera. Hey attention, were you a follower?

230
00:37:58,949 --> 00:38:09,800
I'm falling for fake news. Wait, but the TV told me that DedSec was not very good.

231
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:23,739
Oh shit, the fake news is working on me. Who am I? Am I the spider?

232
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:31,780
Waters and we've been discussing the hacktivist now alleged terrorist group DedSec on this week's

233
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:38,500
Buccaneer radio. I have Colin calling in. Colin what's your take? Now I'll be the same to start.

234
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:45,079
We should have round up DedSec and thrown them in jail. Now I say they should all be locked up.

235
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:50,809
Find it awfully convenient that they've been fingered as the attackers but we've seen no proof.

236
00:38:50,809 --> 00:38:57,900
Say the line. I'd say you have to look at their history of non-violent action.

237
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,300
I thought they just said up there, blame the data center.

238
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:05,340
The hospital in the past few months and DedSec ever has. I smell a scapegoat.

239
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:09,050
Now what do we do? How do I shoot lasers?

240
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:14,019
You're absolutely right Claire. The government's just framing DedSec because they want to make

241
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:22,840
it seem like they have no clue who was behind the bombings. Put that on their side.

242
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:28,090
Who better to depend on? Angie, I have you next. What do you make of all this?

243
00:39:30,489 --> 00:39:32,170
I like swallow the last word.

244
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:40,070
I couldn't even go into the, because I was swallowing.

245
00:39:40,070 --> 00:40:01,030
Do you feel safe for using a pseudonym? Everyone should. Why make it easier for them to track you?

246
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,269
And now we've seen what they're capable of.

247
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:03,989
What am I doing?

248
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:11,269
Hold on. Do you mean the government? Are you suggesting the government was responsible for

249
00:40:11,269 --> 00:40:12,230
the bombings?

250
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:31,719
Fuck. How is it doing that? Why is it just doing that? It's crashed again. Why is it crashing?

251
00:40:35,219 --> 00:40:38,900
No, I haven't even been able to get into, I need to get into a car first.

252
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:43,539
You don't veto an open world car game without driving the car first.

253
00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:55,300
What if I take down a little bit more graphic quality? Put it on medium.

254
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:01,539
You drove the car. That's not a car. That was an animal.

255
00:41:01,539 --> 00:41:07,179
Did you update your drivers? I did like a week ago.

256
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:11,900
What is there like a Watch Dogs Legion launch drivers?

257
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:22,019
That better not be. Man, that always is.

258
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:25,539
That better not be. I have a 1080. They don't even make drivers for me anymore.

259
00:41:25,539 --> 00:41:29,900
They don't care about me. They don't want to make drivers for me

260
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,179
because they don't want me to have a, they want me to get the new one.

261
00:41:33,179 --> 00:41:39,699
All right. If it crashes again, I'm going to update my drivers.

262
00:41:39,699 --> 00:41:53,420
What does it say? The crashes that some players are experiencing are due to Windows problems?

263
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,260
It's caused by outdated Windows.

264
00:41:56,489 --> 00:42:00,659
What? What would that have to fucking do with anything?

265
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:09,460
Dude, is he still alive in this playthrough? He better not be.

266
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:28,550
Windows user detected. Hold on.

267
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:38,250
You see it? If I swear to God off this guy, play a silly game.

268
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:41,739
What is silly game? What does that even mean? Silly game.

269
00:42:43,539 --> 00:42:45,380
This is a silly game.

270
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:53,260
Crashes are due to outdated. Guys, I did a full fresh install of Windows 10

271
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,420
like two weeks ago, three weeks ago.

272
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:58,780
This is all brand new operating system as of like two weeks ago.

273
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:01,429
All fresh, complete updates.

274
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:05,909
I need to assemble a team, but I can't reboot DedSec alone.

275
00:43:05,909 --> 00:43:09,269
What's going on? Let me break into London CTOS and see

276
00:43:09,269 --> 00:43:11,510
who's available. Did I skip a whole thing?

277
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,519
Oh, okay. Go, go, go, go, go. All right. Get in there.

278
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:22,840
Alleged terrorist group, DedSec on this week's Buccaneer Radio.

279
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:28,179
What's your take? We've been saying from the start

280
00:43:28,179 --> 00:43:31,849
we should have ran up DedSec and thrown him in jail.

281
00:43:31,849 --> 00:43:36,250
What were your graphic settings again? You don't find it awfully convenient.

282
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,250
I don't even want to listen to that. I already know.

283
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:42,940
I can't even, I can't hit escape. We have to do this first.

284
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:50,420
Say the line. What would it be doing?

285
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:59,510
Outdated Windows. Why do I feel like that's like weird corporate speak

286
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:02,070
for holy shit, let's get a day two patch out.

287
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,400
All right, Windows may be outdated, I think.

288
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:20,309
Check to see if your monitor is plugged in.

289
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:23,510
Get the patch, get the fucking patch ready by tomorrow, motherfucker.

290
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:27,750
Check to see if your cable, if you plugged in your cable recently,

291
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:28,630
like your power cable.

292
00:44:35,179 --> 00:44:42,280
Access the CTOS data clusters. Reinstall Windows again.

293
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:49,429
What's the graphics card recommended graphics card for this?

294
00:44:50,070 --> 00:45:06,010
It's probably like a 780, 1070. All right, sick. Hack it.

295
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,929
I hacked. I don't know.

296
00:45:11,929 --> 00:45:22,820
Is this a Green Goblin's Tower? What did I just do?

297
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:23,860
Searching for contacts.

298
00:45:24,969 --> 00:45:27,369
Shit, situation is worse than I thought.

299
00:45:28,889 --> 00:45:29,530
Are they all dead?

300
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:36,840
There's a candidate. Looks like your dead sex best hope.

301
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,360
Select your first operative.

302
00:45:46,789 --> 00:45:51,190
6G data plan, fast downloads. Wait, hold on.

303
00:45:54,519 --> 00:46:01,260
Animator has a crowbar. Wrench, heavy, melee weapon.

304
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:09,480
Really fast downloads. I think I like Lindsay Cullen.

305
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,159
Runs hacker forum on the dark web.

306
00:46:13,639 --> 00:46:16,280
Yeah, so he runs a hacker forum on the dark web.

307
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:27,139
Therefore, he wears a bright purple LED vest and glasses that have emotes on them.

308
00:46:27,139 --> 00:46:30,579
Nancy recently purchased a $200,000 sports car.

309
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:33,380
Personal sports vehicle. Oh shit, that's kind of cool.

310
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:44,630
Motorcycle. Okay, but I feel like everybody clicked this because it said internet celebrity.

311
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:50,659
Nancy Drew. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. We're not done.

312
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:52,840
It's podcaster. Ugh.

313
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:03,130
Grates fake coupons. Dancer.

314
00:47:03,849 --> 00:47:06,949
That's okay. Oh wait, hold on.

315
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:11,780
What about the old guy that used to sell snake oil back in like the 1800s?

316
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:21,739
Has a private phone line to the police commissioner.

317
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:31,420
What? Wrote five star review of the Earl's Fortune Pub.

318
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:34,300
That's not really that big. That's not like a big thing.

319
00:47:35,179 --> 00:47:36,139
That's not a big deal.

320
00:47:38,619 --> 00:47:41,019
Has private phone line to the police commissioner.

321
00:47:41,019 --> 00:47:43,769
Wrote a Yelp review once.

322
00:47:43,769 --> 00:47:47,639
Why would you... I don't want... What?

323
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:52,949
Board game designer. I thought it was like he gets a free VR.

324
00:47:52,949 --> 00:47:56,469
SV? Oh shit!

325
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:00,389
Salary. All right.

326
00:48:01,449 --> 00:48:11,320
I mean, I think it's going to be Nancy. Nancy, the sports car.

327
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,519
Wait, we didn't see the end.

328
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,380
Oh, this guy's a smuggler.

329
00:48:17,159 --> 00:48:20,519
No. No. I'm Nancy.

330
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:25,340
Nancy Schramm. She's got an awesome car.

331
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:33,130
All right, Nancy, let's go.

332
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:37,699
Welcome to the Resi... Resistance. Residence.

333
00:48:37,699 --> 00:48:40,340
Nancy Schramm will be the first member of your DedSec team.

334
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:42,500
Continue growing your team by recruiting new members.

335
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:52,570
I was just...

336
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:57,829
Okay, this guy's a Satanist.

337
00:48:57,829 --> 00:48:59,480
I'm not a Satanist.

338
00:49:02,679 --> 00:49:05,320
What's with this little blue sedan? Where's my sports car?

339
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:15,780
The game is fucking loud.

340
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:20,650
Okay, here we go.

341
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,119
Hold on. This game is loud as shit.

342
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:27,559
Turn it down. There we go.

343
00:49:29,559 --> 00:49:31,239
Okay, locate the safe house entrance.

344
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:35,320
Press... What the hell is that?

345
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,840
What is that button? What is this way, that way?

346
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,440
What is this way, that way? What button is that?

347
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:42,199
Tab? It's a waypoint.

348
00:49:42,199 --> 00:49:45,820
Okay, what a waypoint.

349
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:55,219
Okay, let's go. Locate the safe house.

350
00:49:55,219 --> 00:50:00,309
All right, that's a handbrake.

351
00:50:00,869 --> 00:50:03,829
Brake, drive, toggle music, change music, auto drive.

352
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:04,949
Wait, there's an auto drive?

353
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:20,980
This looks like shit.

354
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:24,309
This looks like Nintendo 64.

355
00:50:29,739 --> 00:50:31,900
Why does it look like Nintendo 64?

356
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,590
Is this the wrong way? It don't matter.

357
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:38,389
There's no... There's no police in this game, is there?

358
00:50:39,030 --> 00:51:01,289
Don't move!

359
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:07,349
Watch dogs.

360
00:51:07,909 --> 00:51:11,219
They don't even care? No, apparently not.

361
00:51:11,219 --> 00:51:16,539
Where's this GPS taking me?

362
00:51:16,539 --> 00:51:29,000
Where is this GPS taking me?

363
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:37,349
What is happening?

364
00:51:37,349 --> 00:51:42,139
I'm supposed to follow the blue arrow, right?

365
00:51:54,329 --> 00:51:55,610
Wrong side of the road.

366
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:57,289
Oh, that's right. We're in...

367
00:51:57,289 --> 00:51:58,570
We're not in America.

368
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:03,030
Well, that's going to be horrible.

369
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:03,909
Hack this guy.

370
00:52:03,909 --> 00:52:09,860
I can... Wait, I can drive his car?

371
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:16,570
Wait. Oh, that's too bad.

372
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:17,610
All right, let's go.

373
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:20,389
Oh, I found it. It's right here.

374
00:52:20,389 --> 00:52:28,070
I don't have a high enough hacker level?

375
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:29,349
Oh, that's not cool.

376
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:30,630
All right, get out here.

377
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:40,699
All right, I made it.

378
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:41,980
Oh, you blood don'ts.

379
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:50,539
Manual override.

380
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:57,420
Okay, access point.

381
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:00,059
Use to rotate the nodes.

382
00:53:00,059 --> 00:53:01,659
Complete the circuit to solve the puzzle.

383
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:05,909
Rotate the...

384
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:08,150
What is going on in 2020

385
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:09,750
with these fucking rotate puzzles?

386
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:17,210
This is very, very, very, very, very much

387
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:22,820
the exact same thing that we did in Alex.

388
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:25,059
Okay, you're going to have to manual override it

389
00:53:25,059 --> 00:53:25,780
to the painting.

390
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:29,670
All right, that's unlocked.

391
00:53:30,739 --> 00:53:32,579
That's unlocked. That's good.

392
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:33,539
Now I have to go like this.

393
00:53:33,539 --> 00:53:34,340
Unlock this one.

394
00:53:35,059 --> 00:53:37,289
Open that fucking door.

395
00:53:46,199 --> 00:53:51,269
Radiator. Open the radiator?

396
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:53,030
Oh, this is our secret hideout.

397
00:53:53,030 --> 00:54:03,460
Oh, we're up the safe house.

398
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,300
Right, because I'm the only operative ever

399
00:54:05,539 --> 00:54:06,500
that exists.

400
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,139
It's just me.

401
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:14,840
All right, let's boot it back up.

402
00:54:22,329 --> 00:54:23,050
You drove the car.

403
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:24,010
Now you can stop playing.

404
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:33,280
Stop.

405
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:37,260
My name is Nancy Schwab.

406
00:54:40,059 --> 00:54:40,780
I'm with Sabine.

407
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:41,980
Who the hell do you think you are?

408
00:54:51,739 --> 00:55:01,179
Who says that?

409
00:55:01,179 --> 00:55:02,539
What cartoon character says that?

410
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:05,099
What power that you could possibly imagine?

411
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:12,599
Oh, what's this?

412
00:55:19,059 --> 00:55:20,820
That's how you make a 100-hour game, by the way.

413
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:21,780
Not me.

414
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:24,099
I'll be done in about 12 hours.

415
00:55:24,659 --> 00:55:34,860
Probably less than that.

416
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:36,860
All right, I activated Bagley's servers.

417
00:55:38,619 --> 00:55:48,460
What about the mask?

418
00:55:55,659 --> 00:55:56,300
Oh, there's a mask.

419
00:55:58,300 --> 00:55:58,860
Wait, loot?

420
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:01,980
Wait, can I drop loot?

421
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,380
Doesn't Ubisoft do stuff like that?

422
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,300
Can I drop a box on the stream?

423
00:56:10,539 --> 00:56:11,099
Can I do that?

424
00:56:18,539 --> 00:56:19,900
All right, let's contact Sabine.

425
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:20,460
Mask.

426
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,579
Oh, I got a pig mask.

427
00:56:22,219 --> 00:56:26,550
Where's my, do I have an inventory?

428
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:31,050
Where's inventory?

429
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:37,880
It's Saw.

430
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,139
Make some pig noises for that mask.

431
00:56:44,139 --> 00:56:46,840
Okay, this is for you.

432
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,800
I don't even know who said that, but sure.

433
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:00,409
Is your memory intact?

434
00:57:00,409 --> 00:57:01,449
Not even slightly.

435
00:57:01,449 --> 00:57:04,010
The last record I have is of our HQ being raided.

436
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:06,489
My only lead is a group known as Zero Day.

437
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:07,210
Ring any bells?

438
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:12,010
Don't blame me.

439
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:13,369
Blame the person that told me to do that.

440
00:57:15,059 --> 00:57:16,179
That was pretty good, though, wasn't it?

441
00:57:16,179 --> 00:57:17,500
Just one chance.

442
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,420
They just gunned everyone down.

443
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:20,969
My god.

444
00:57:20,969 --> 00:57:21,849
How'd you survive?

445
00:57:23,099 --> 00:57:25,019
I managed to escape through the sewers to Camden.

446
00:57:25,019 --> 00:57:25,659
That's pretty good.

447
00:57:25,659 --> 00:57:26,059
What's wrong with it?

448
00:57:26,059 --> 00:57:27,340
A contact snuck up with me out of the city,

449
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,340
and I've been hiding out in the north since.

450
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:29,900
Prudent.

451
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:32,300
Your profile is read flagged as a high-priority target

452
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:33,739
in the city's surveillance system.

453
00:57:33,739 --> 00:57:35,420
Even a partial recognition here would have you

454
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:36,860
hunted down and shot on sight.

455
00:57:37,659 --> 00:57:40,139
There aren't many DedSec fans in London these days.

456
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:42,619
Look, I want to help.

457
00:57:42,619 --> 00:57:43,260
I do.

458
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:46,300
But joining up with you now verges on suicidal.

459
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,699
Listen, if anyone knows anything about risks, it's me.

460
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,500
I lost everything and everyone.

461
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:53,670
But it comes down to this.

462
00:57:55,239 --> 00:57:56,840
London is in a death spiral.

463
00:57:58,010 --> 00:57:59,769
And if DedSec can't pull it out,

464
00:57:59,769 --> 00:58:01,369
trust me, no one can.

465
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:03,289
Actually moving so much?

466
00:58:03,289 --> 00:58:04,969
City needs a resistance.

467
00:58:04,969 --> 00:58:07,849
Yeah, I mean, it is kind of like a puppeteer.

468
00:58:08,489 --> 00:58:10,570
It's like moving the head around every word

469
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:13,050
to make sure you over-enunciate everything.

470
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:13,849
Fine.

471
00:58:13,849 --> 00:58:15,530
That's how puppeteers do it.

472
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:16,969
Excellent.

473
00:58:16,969 --> 00:58:18,570
New user registered.

474
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:20,250
Welcome to DedSec.

475
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:21,050
I'm not going to skip this.

476
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,780
Guys, I'm allowed to play one, like,

477
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:28,500
six out of ten AAA release a year, okay?

478
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,659
Now, it would be irresponsible of us to release you

479
00:58:30,659 --> 00:58:32,420
naked and mewling into the wild.

480
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:33,940
You'll find equipment around the safe house

481
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:36,019
that are essential items in your DedSec kit.

482
00:58:36,019 --> 00:58:36,820
Pick a better one.

483
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:40,420
I just came out fucking two hours ago.

484
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:41,780
It just released.

485
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:42,260
I don't know.

486
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:49,019
Tech points can be found throughout London

487
00:58:49,019 --> 00:58:50,380
using the purchase tech upgrades.

488
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,139
Gadgets and weapons.

489
00:58:52,139 --> 00:58:52,780
Cool.

490
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:57,289
Equipping tech to change an operative's weapon

491
00:58:57,289 --> 00:58:59,690
or gadget use the edit function in the team menu.

492
00:59:00,679 --> 00:59:01,000
Nice.

493
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:03,179
Spend tech points.

494
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:06,730
Ooh, tech points.

495
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:08,260
What's this?

496
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:11,099
I got ten tech points.

497
00:59:11,099 --> 00:59:13,900
Chase drones can be hijacked.

498
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:16,059
AR camouflage to render that we're invisible

499
00:59:16,059 --> 00:59:18,090
and break line of sight.

500
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:19,380
Cool.

501
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:23,940
This is an LTL-68P DedSec pistol.

502
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:28,059
These look like Team Fortress weapons.

503
00:59:28,059 --> 00:59:33,750
Ooh, infiltrator spider bot.

504
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:35,380
A stealth-based spider bot

505
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:39,269
capable of performing non-lethal takedowns.

506
00:59:39,269 --> 00:59:40,150
Chat.

507
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:41,269
Should we get that one, chat?

508
00:59:43,019 --> 00:59:43,980
Yeah, sure.

509
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:50,219
All right, data.

510
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:51,099
Cool.

511
00:59:51,099 --> 00:59:51,670
All right.

512
00:59:52,309 --> 00:59:54,409
Edit operative.

513
00:59:54,409 --> 00:59:57,239
All right, you have a pistol.

514
00:59:58,119 --> 00:59:58,679
That works.

515
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,519
You've got a nice car.

516
01:00:01,159 --> 01:00:03,480
And we're going to give you the spider robot.

517
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,019
Where is this?

518
01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:06,059
The ultimate sports car.

519
01:00:06,059 --> 01:00:06,699
Speedy and sleek.

520
01:00:06,699 --> 01:00:08,780
It will never be mistaken for another car.

521
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:10,139
Oh, I can change the paint job.

522
01:00:10,619 --> 01:00:12,409
Is this an Ubisoft box?

523
01:00:12,409 --> 01:00:14,389
This is not an Ubisoft box, right?

524
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:16,820
Is this an Ubisoft box?

525
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:26,650
Really?

526
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:29,530
I can only buy gray and black.

527
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:31,929
I can't do like blue.

528
01:00:31,929 --> 01:00:34,519
Whatever.

529
01:00:34,519 --> 01:00:36,969
It's in-game.

530
01:00:36,969 --> 01:00:37,369
Oh, okay.

531
01:00:37,369 --> 01:00:40,730
A sophisticated system for hiding your identity from facial recognition tech.

532
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:45,929
It's called a mask.

533
01:00:45,929 --> 01:00:46,969
Hold on a second.

534
01:00:46,969 --> 01:00:47,929
Hold on.

535
01:00:47,929 --> 01:00:53,500
Hold on a minute.

536
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:53,739
Hold on.

537
01:00:53,739 --> 01:01:02,199
Everyone relax.

538
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:03,719
Yes, everybody relax.

539
01:01:03,719 --> 01:01:10,039
All right, we don't have to shut the computer off.

540
01:01:10,039 --> 01:01:11,579
We're here.

541
01:01:11,579 --> 01:01:13,659
Perhaps we can talk about updating your wardrobe.

542
01:01:13,659 --> 01:01:14,059
I mean, literally.

543
01:01:14,059 --> 01:01:14,460
All right, nice.

544
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:18,250
Come on.

545
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:19,690
Buy a new PC, you fucker.

546
01:01:21,139 --> 01:01:22,739
Look, all the new shit came out.

547
01:01:22,739 --> 01:01:24,260
Like the 3090s.

548
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:27,139
The new AMD risen shit.

549
01:01:27,139 --> 01:01:28,420
I got to get those.

550
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:29,780
What, you want me to buy?

551
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:31,059
If I'm going to buy like a new computer,

552
01:01:31,059 --> 01:01:32,579
I want to buy like old hardware.

553
01:01:32,579 --> 01:01:33,860
I want to get the new shit.

554
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,510
It's got to be available.

555
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:40,230
No, this is too many ubi bucks.

556
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:48,570
No, this is too many ubi bucks.

557
01:01:48,570 --> 01:01:49,289
Facewear.

558
01:01:49,289 --> 01:01:50,010
Okay.

559
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:53,980
This one's fine.

560
01:01:55,989 --> 01:01:56,630
Okay, hat.

561
01:01:57,269 --> 01:02:01,110
Okay, just turn into a completely different person.

562
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:05,719
All right, I want this one.

563
01:02:05,719 --> 01:02:06,599
Sure, I'll take it.

564
01:02:10,809 --> 01:02:14,389
Glasses.

565
01:02:14,389 --> 01:02:14,710
Bag.

566
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:20,409
This is GTA 4 graphics.

567
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:23,050
It does kind of look like GTA 4.

568
01:02:25,349 --> 01:02:28,389
It really does look like GTA 4.

569
01:02:29,909 --> 01:02:35,699
Oh, why?

570
01:02:35,699 --> 01:02:37,139
This 1080 is not even that bad.

571
01:02:45,719 --> 01:02:46,920
Every setting on low.

572
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:47,880
No, I don't have...

573
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,639
The 1080 is not even a bad graphics card.

574
01:02:49,639 --> 01:02:51,079
It's not even like four years old.

575
01:02:58,679 --> 01:02:59,559
Okay, I just...

576
01:02:59,559 --> 01:03:00,840
I think I just killed that person.

577
01:03:02,539 --> 01:03:03,019
What happened?

578
01:03:04,869 --> 01:03:05,429
Guard break.

579
01:03:08,219 --> 01:03:08,780
Guard break.

580
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:11,800
Yes, nice one.

581
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:19,110
Oh my god.

582
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:21,110
Put on gloves or something, guys.

583
01:03:22,389 --> 01:03:25,110
Use like fucking rock-em-boppers,

584
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:26,789
whatever it's called, sock-em-boppers.

585
01:03:29,530 --> 01:03:30,570
Holy shit.

586
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:32,170
Why are you hitting each other for real?

587
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:32,809
The face.

588
01:03:45,449 --> 01:03:46,570
Just the hay bakers.

589
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:49,739
Oh my god.

590
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:53,050
Throw punch.

591
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:55,059
Guard break.

592
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:02,469
Finisher.

593
01:04:02,469 --> 01:04:08,179
Now, thanks for the training.

594
01:04:08,179 --> 01:04:18,519
This person is really hurt.

595
01:04:19,159 --> 01:04:26,070
That's where you're going to take the commercial break?

596
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:30,340
Okay, let's leave the safe house.

597
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:34,489
Right, gear in order.

598
01:04:34,489 --> 01:04:35,849
No enough not to punch yourself in the face.

599
01:04:35,849 --> 01:04:38,090
I've got a pistol.

600
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:38,809
Brilliant.

601
01:04:38,809 --> 01:04:41,460
I'm working at mine zero day and ruin their day,

602
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,699
but I need someone with actual legs to do the leg work.

603
01:04:43,699 --> 01:04:45,380
The 1080 came out in 2016.

604
01:04:46,179 --> 01:04:47,139
It's not even that long ago.

605
01:04:47,139 --> 01:04:48,500
If we want to change the perception

606
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,579
that we're a bunch of violent thugs,

607
01:04:50,579 --> 01:04:53,559
let you be the judge of how best to handle yourself.

608
01:04:53,559 --> 01:04:56,760
But remember, you represent Deadset now.

609
01:04:57,659 --> 01:05:00,409
Yes, it is four years old.

610
01:05:00,409 --> 01:05:01,130
It's not old.

611
01:05:01,929 --> 01:05:03,210
Like if your work's just fine.

612
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:11,820
Start recruitment.

613
01:05:13,219 --> 01:05:14,739
All right, Sabine, what's our plan?

614
01:05:14,739 --> 01:05:17,940
Wait, I recruit this drunk guy?

615
01:05:21,539 --> 01:05:22,900
Why can I only recruit this guy?

616
01:05:24,679 --> 01:05:27,239
And all our cowering just makes it easier to step on.

617
01:05:29,739 --> 01:05:30,539
Only old people.

618
01:05:30,539 --> 01:05:31,099
I just want to look.

619
01:05:31,099 --> 01:05:31,659
I just want to see.

620
01:05:31,659 --> 01:05:33,980
You look like the sort who might want to take back their city.

621
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:36,139
Are you Deadset?

622
01:05:36,139 --> 01:05:38,539
If you are, I need help with something.

623
01:05:38,539 --> 01:05:40,780
If I was, I certainly wouldn't say so.

624
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:42,699
Now, what's the situation?

625
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:45,179
These Kelly maggots.

626
01:05:45,179 --> 01:05:46,380
Zoomer haircut.

627
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:48,699
They burned down my cousin's dry cleaning shop

628
01:05:48,699 --> 01:05:50,699
because he said no to pain protection.

629
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:53,900
How dreadful.

630
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:55,739
I know who it was that set the fire.

631
01:05:55,739 --> 01:05:56,460
But the cops...

632
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:57,900
You're wearing a Dedsec hat.

633
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:59,179
The police won't help you, darling.

634
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:00,780
But we will.

635
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:01,260
Yeah, I am.

636
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:04,219
Rest assured, these gangsters will be put away.

637
01:06:06,219 --> 01:06:07,980
That's not very sneaky.

638
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,559
All right, so we got a new recruit member.

639
01:06:14,199 --> 01:06:16,360
All right.

640
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:17,559
Dedsec, chapter started.

641
01:06:17,559 --> 01:06:18,440
Squad goals.

642
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,719
Potential recruit right here.

643
01:06:35,099 --> 01:06:36,539
Is he still a recruit?

644
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:39,739
Okay, he's still...

645
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:43,340
We're just having a little bit of fun, I guess.

646
01:06:46,139 --> 01:06:49,179
Injured and hospitalized by operative Nancy Schramm.

647
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:52,219
Well, who cares about that guy anyway?

648
01:06:52,219 --> 01:06:52,940
He's dead.

649
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:55,719
What about you?

650
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:59,849
You want to join us?

651
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,250
You look like someone who might want to fight for London.

652
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:04,730
You look like somebody that was AI-generated.

653
01:07:22,489 --> 01:07:23,449
Oh, I like this guy way better.

654
01:07:23,449 --> 01:07:24,409
He's a crypto guy.

655
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:39,099
I don't know why.

656
01:07:39,099 --> 01:07:40,860
I thought he was holding a grenade for a second.

657
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:42,380
I was like, this guy's fucking crazy.

658
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:44,659
Okay.

659
01:07:44,659 --> 01:07:46,659
Recruit Justin Johansson.

660
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:49,559
Let's do it.

661
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:50,840
So let's go.

662
01:07:51,639 --> 01:07:52,280
What do I have to do?

663
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,019
Okay.

664
01:07:57,019 --> 01:08:00,300
Justin Johansson is sympathetic to Dedsec and might be willing to join up.

665
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:01,579
Talk to them to learn more.

666
01:08:08,329 --> 01:08:08,969
Shoot him.

667
01:08:08,969 --> 01:08:10,329
I'm not going to shoot that guy.

668
01:08:14,099 --> 01:08:14,579
Why am I?

669
01:08:14,579 --> 01:08:14,820
What is it?

670
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:15,940
What is this weird helmet?

671
01:08:16,899 --> 01:08:17,539
Where's my car?

672
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:23,220
There's nobody even in this car.

673
01:08:23,779 --> 01:08:25,380
Why was this car just sitting here?

674
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:26,100
What?

675
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:31,909
I need a waypoint.

676
01:08:31,909 --> 01:08:36,619
It's like 100 million years away.

677
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:38,439
All right.

678
01:08:38,439 --> 01:08:38,840
Let's move.

679
01:08:39,399 --> 01:08:49,479
I want that.

680
01:08:49,479 --> 01:08:51,079
But no, it's like a piece of delivery thing.

681
01:08:51,079 --> 01:08:51,560
I don't want that.

682
01:08:54,310 --> 01:08:55,189
GTA 3.

683
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:57,670
It's not very good.

684
01:08:57,670 --> 01:08:57,989
It isn't.

685
01:08:58,630 --> 01:08:59,500
But it's okay.

686
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:06,819
Yep.

687
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:08,250
Yep.

688
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:17,369
It's so ugly.

689
01:09:17,369 --> 01:09:18,329
It's okay.

690
01:09:18,329 --> 01:09:18,970
It's okay.

691
01:09:19,930 --> 01:09:22,010
Wait.

692
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:23,529
Recruit.

693
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:31,960
Okay.

694
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:34,359
So I have this watchdog stream.

695
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,239
Anybody else's watchdog stream look like shit?

696
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:40,409
Is this like a game thing or is this a computer thing?

697
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:51,100
It's both.

698
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:52,279
Oops.

699
01:09:58,199 --> 01:10:00,600
An invisible man was just in the road

700
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,079
and just grabbed me by the back of my collar.

701
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:08,489
Who is?

702
01:10:08,489 --> 01:10:13,140
This person is doing graffiti.

703
01:10:16,699 --> 01:10:17,500
Bye.

704
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:26,810
What the fuck are you doing?

705
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:29,859
Why would you do that?

706
01:10:30,579 --> 01:10:31,699
What were you thinking?

707
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:33,939
What are you doing?

708
01:10:34,899 --> 01:10:36,340
What a fucking idiot.

709
01:10:40,729 --> 01:10:41,930
Hack the world.

710
01:10:46,090 --> 01:10:46,489
Okay.

711
01:10:47,369 --> 01:10:47,930
Let's go.

712
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:53,590
I caved in that lady's chest.

713
01:10:57,770 --> 01:10:58,170
Okay.

714
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:19,430
I need to take a second.

715
01:11:21,109 --> 01:11:22,069
Holy shit.

716
01:11:22,069 --> 01:11:23,829
People just walk in front of your car.

717
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:26,149
Oh, this is a play ball.

718
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,239
Hit the inputs in time to hit the ball.

719
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:33,050
What is this?

720
01:11:33,050 --> 01:11:36,010
According to an official post on Ubisoft 4,

721
01:11:36,010 --> 01:11:37,609
a watchdog's legion bug was detected

722
01:11:37,609 --> 01:11:40,010
which would cause performance issues on the game.

723
01:11:40,010 --> 01:11:40,970
While releasing the hotfix,

724
01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:42,250
the developer wrote in the post,

725
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:44,329
we're developing a hotfix to address the performance issues

726
01:11:44,329 --> 01:11:46,649
we're seeing on PS4, Xbox, and PC.

727
01:11:46,649 --> 01:11:49,430
The hotfix has been deployed on PS4 and Xbox.

728
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:51,430
PC gamers are left away today as the dev...

729
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:56,340
Yeah.

730
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:56,979
Okay.

731
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:58,659
Hit the inputs in time...

732
01:11:58,659 --> 01:11:59,939
My whole body hurts.

733
01:11:59,939 --> 01:12:00,340
Hold on.

734
01:12:01,369 --> 01:12:01,930
Ahem.

735
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:05,689
Hit the inputs in time to hit the ball.

736
01:12:05,689 --> 01:12:06,409
Okay.

737
01:12:06,409 --> 01:12:08,420
Get a number of perfect hits to do tricks.

738
01:12:08,979 --> 01:12:10,010
Let's go.

739
01:12:10,649 --> 01:12:14,420
Okay.

740
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:15,140
Let's go.

741
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:15,619
A, L.

742
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:22,340
I did it again.

743
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:37,899
Wrong move!

744
01:12:37,899 --> 01:12:38,699
What are you talking about?

745
01:12:39,899 --> 01:12:40,300
Do it again.

746
01:12:42,069 --> 01:12:43,350
In heels, yeah.

747
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:43,590
What?

748
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:44,869
That's a different key.

749
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:49,539
What the...

750
01:12:49,539 --> 01:12:51,060
These are different keys.

751
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:52,260
A, S, and K, and L.

752
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:15,260
I mean, that's...

753
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:15,659
Whatever.

754
01:13:16,779 --> 01:13:16,939
Wait.

755
01:13:16,939 --> 01:13:17,500
What am I doing?

756
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:23,859
Oh, I gotta go in here.

757
01:13:37,779 --> 01:13:38,420
Hack.

758
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:39,050
All right.

759
01:13:39,050 --> 01:13:39,529
I hacked it.

760
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:47,350
Okay.

761
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:49,590
We have to steal the crypto.

762
01:13:49,590 --> 01:14:00,899
Wait, these are bad guys?

763
01:14:00,899 --> 01:14:01,619
That guy's a gun.

764
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:08,619
Wait.

765
01:14:08,619 --> 01:14:09,100
Hold on.

766
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:10,220
I don't want to kill this guy.

767
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:16,659
What's going on?

768
01:14:17,399 --> 01:14:18,119
Oh, shit.

769
01:14:18,119 --> 01:14:18,359
Okay.

770
01:14:18,359 --> 01:14:19,720
I steal the crypto key.

771
01:14:20,279 --> 01:14:24,739
All right.

772
01:14:24,739 --> 01:14:25,140
It's down there.

773
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:42,699
I got it.

774
01:14:42,699 --> 01:14:42,939
Wait.

775
01:14:42,939 --> 01:14:44,420
There's permadeath.

776
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:45,460
There's actually permadeath.

777
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:46,020
There's permadeath.

778
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:46,979
There's permadeath.

779
01:14:46,979 --> 01:14:51,300
Hack the drone.

780
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:51,779
Hack the drone.

781
01:14:56,699 --> 01:14:56,939
What?

782
01:14:56,939 --> 01:14:58,060
This gun didn't even do anything.

783
01:14:58,779 --> 01:14:59,859
Get back in the car.

784
01:15:00,659 --> 01:15:07,189
Okay.

785
01:15:07,189 --> 01:15:09,029
So this is like a gang hideout.

786
01:15:09,029 --> 01:15:10,409
Evaded.

787
01:15:10,409 --> 01:15:11,449
Do you need a minute?

788
01:15:11,449 --> 01:15:13,609
Ready when you are, my little robot friend.

789
01:15:13,609 --> 01:15:19,659
Why are people screaming?

790
01:15:19,659 --> 01:15:23,779
I just heard somebody go...

791
01:15:24,739 --> 01:15:31,880
What's going on?

792
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:33,319
Why was we freaking out?

793
01:15:33,319 --> 01:15:41,770
Can't climb this?

794
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:42,329
Okay.

795
01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:48,890
All right.

796
01:15:48,890 --> 01:15:50,010
Let's sneak in here.

797
01:15:50,010 --> 01:15:51,609
I gotta recruit this guy.

798
01:15:51,609 --> 01:16:01,609
I have to.

799
01:16:01,609 --> 01:16:01,930
Okay.

800
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:02,569
I gotta go up here.

801
01:16:02,569 --> 01:16:02,729
All right.

802
01:16:02,729 --> 01:16:02,970
I'm gonna...

803
01:16:02,970 --> 01:16:03,289
Let's do it.

804
01:16:03,289 --> 01:16:03,850
Let's do it for real.

805
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:04,409
For real.

806
01:16:04,409 --> 01:16:07,350
Let's take the hacker spider over there.

807
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:07,909
All right.

808
01:16:07,909 --> 01:16:10,699
All right.

809
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:12,220
I'm gonna deploy hacker spider.

810
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:21,800
So I can do a stealth...

811
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:22,039
Wait.

812
01:16:22,039 --> 01:16:23,000
What's V, right?

813
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:23,239
Okay.

814
01:16:23,239 --> 01:16:23,560
Hold on.

815
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:24,439
What do we got?

816
01:16:24,439 --> 01:16:26,100
We got...

817
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:27,300
Oh, there's a drone right there.

818
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:27,939
All right.

819
01:16:27,939 --> 01:16:29,699
It's like a Pokemon fight here.

820
01:16:29,699 --> 01:16:32,260
Can I hack that?

821
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:38,899
Disable.

822
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:40,260
I can't disable it.

823
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:47,899
Oh, wait.

824
01:16:47,899 --> 01:16:48,779
I got a camera right there.

825
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:49,659
All right.

826
01:16:49,659 --> 01:16:50,300
Hack that camera.

827
01:16:51,029 --> 01:16:52,630
I'll use this camera to hack that thing.

828
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:54,149
Hack it.

829
01:16:54,149 --> 01:16:56,100
Goodbye.

830
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:56,500
See ya.

831
01:16:57,140 --> 01:17:00,630
Wait.

832
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:01,350
What?

833
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:05,539
No.

834
01:17:05,539 --> 01:17:06,340
What happened to the spider?

835
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:08,810
Oh, shit.

836
01:17:08,810 --> 01:17:09,289
This is bad.

837
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:21,539
All right.

838
01:17:21,539 --> 01:17:22,180
I just gotta go...

839
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:22,659
Okay.

840
01:17:22,659 --> 01:17:24,180
Let's distract.

841
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:24,979
Okay.

842
01:17:24,979 --> 01:17:29,220
I'm gonna drive this car.

843
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:29,939
Wait.

844
01:17:29,939 --> 01:17:32,810
He's gonna walk into it.

845
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:34,250
I can make it go backwards?

846
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:34,489
All right.

847
01:17:34,489 --> 01:17:34,890
I'm gonna make it...

848
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:35,210
I'm gonna drive...

849
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:36,619
I'm gonna run him over.

850
01:17:36,619 --> 01:17:36,939
Say it.

851
01:17:36,939 --> 01:17:37,180
All right.

852
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:37,739
Enemy.

853
01:17:37,739 --> 01:17:40,649
All right.

854
01:17:40,649 --> 01:17:41,770
Just move over there.

855
01:17:41,770 --> 01:17:42,890
And here we go.

856
01:17:42,890 --> 01:17:43,529
Ready?

857
01:17:43,529 --> 01:17:51,210
Go get it.

858
01:17:51,210 --> 01:17:58,039
Hack that.

859
01:17:58,039 --> 01:17:58,439
What is it?

860
01:17:58,439 --> 01:17:58,840
A book?

861
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,119
How do you hack a book?

862
01:18:00,119 --> 01:18:07,770
Oh, shit.

863
01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:08,170
Oh, shit.

864
01:18:08,170 --> 01:18:08,489
Oh, shit.

865
01:18:08,489 --> 01:18:08,890
Oh, shit.

866
01:18:08,890 --> 01:18:09,130
Oh, shit.

867
01:18:09,130 --> 01:18:09,529
Oh, shit.

868
01:18:09,529 --> 01:18:09,850
Oh, shit.

869
01:18:09,850 --> 01:18:10,729
Oh, shit.

870
01:18:10,729 --> 01:18:13,880
Turn him off.

871
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:14,439
Disable him.

872
01:18:15,079 --> 01:18:16,409
Disable him.

873
01:18:27,779 --> 01:18:28,420
What?

874
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:31,720
I have a car in my backpack?

875
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:40,579
What the fuck?

876
01:19:00,539 --> 01:19:01,819
What the fuck?

877
01:19:01,819 --> 01:19:07,319
Here are the frames.

878
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:08,760
Don't blame me.

879
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:10,199
Blame Ubisoft.

880
01:19:10,199 --> 01:19:12,460
They're the ones that have a hot fix coming out.

881
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:13,979
A game came out, but it's not ready.

882
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:14,619
Who cares?

883
01:19:14,619 --> 01:19:15,420
Put it out anyways.

884
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:20,380
Those fucking idiots on PC.

885
01:19:21,579 --> 01:19:23,899
See you in a week when it actually works.

886
01:19:23,899 --> 01:19:35,109
I'm getting in here.

887
01:19:47,579 --> 01:19:48,300
This is too hard.

888
01:19:48,300 --> 01:20:05,060
There's too much shit in here that I have to deal with.

889
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:05,779
The two drones...

890
01:20:05,779 --> 01:20:07,140
There's like four drones here.

891
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:09,560
I'm not supposed to be over here right now.

892
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:10,920
There's no way I'm supposed to be over here.

893
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:12,779
This shit...

894
01:20:12,779 --> 01:20:14,539
There's like four drones.

895
01:20:14,539 --> 01:20:22,630
Wait.

896
01:20:22,630 --> 01:20:23,670
This is my bike.

897
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:30,779
Steal the van?

898
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:34,729
Go get it.

899
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:38,680
Go get it.

900
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:40,359
What the fuck, man?

901
01:20:40,359 --> 01:20:42,899
Go.

902
01:20:44,890 --> 01:20:45,930
Go get the van.

903
01:20:45,930 --> 01:20:54,409
It's right there.

904
01:20:54,409 --> 01:20:55,289
This gun doesn't...

905
01:21:02,869 --> 01:21:03,510
No shit.

906
01:21:11,739 --> 01:21:11,979
Go.

907
01:21:13,029 --> 01:21:13,510
Go.

908
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:14,149
What are you doing?

909
01:21:14,149 --> 01:21:15,029
Why is toggle on?

910
01:21:15,029 --> 01:21:16,710
That was the worst decision I've made all day.

911
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:24,970
Go, go, go, go, go.

912
01:21:24,970 --> 01:21:25,609
Get out of the way.

913
01:21:27,529 --> 01:21:28,569
How do I get the fuck out of here?

914
01:21:28,569 --> 01:21:28,810
Okay.

915
01:21:29,689 --> 01:21:30,090
Hack it.

916
01:21:41,979 --> 01:21:50,500
Drive the van to the drop point.

917
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:50,899
You got it.

918
01:21:51,539 --> 01:22:03,270
It's one kilometer away.

919
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,640
Why can you just make people drive?

920
01:22:09,479 --> 01:22:09,880
All right.

921
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:11,239
Where's the drop zone?

922
01:22:11,239 --> 01:22:13,260
Oh, this is the first actual mission.

923
01:22:15,350 --> 01:22:16,310
You fucking idiots.

924
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:29,270
Here's the thing I remember about Watch Dogs.

925
01:22:29,829 --> 01:22:31,989
I remember it was kind of fun to like

926
01:22:31,989 --> 01:22:36,699
make the thing in the ground go up four or five times.

927
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:40,119
And then it was just like...

928
01:22:40,119 --> 01:22:43,479
You just spam Q wherever you're driving.

929
01:22:43,479 --> 01:22:45,079
That's all I remember.

930
01:22:45,079 --> 01:22:45,800
It's just going like this.

931
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:50,939
Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q.

932
01:22:51,899 --> 01:22:53,180
Oh, the hydrogen exploded.

933
01:23:02,890 --> 01:23:03,770
Two FPS?

934
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:04,890
It's not going two FPS.

935
01:23:11,529 --> 01:23:12,329
It is?

936
01:23:12,329 --> 01:23:12,890
No, it's not.

937
01:23:13,529 --> 01:23:30,859
It's 30.

938
01:23:30,859 --> 01:23:31,260
Yeah.

939
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:34,140
I mean, 30 in 2020 looks like two.

940
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:43,720
All right.

941
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,800
We recruited the AI-generated person.

942
01:23:46,439 --> 01:23:47,159
Wow.

943
01:23:47,159 --> 01:23:47,479
Okay.

944
01:23:48,279 --> 01:23:48,680
Whoa.

945
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:52,039
What?

946
01:23:53,609 --> 01:23:54,489
You live in the van to...

947
01:23:55,210 --> 01:23:56,010
What the...

948
01:23:56,010 --> 01:23:56,810
What's this gas?

949
01:24:00,579 --> 01:24:01,779
What the fuck is happening?

950
01:24:07,399 --> 01:24:10,199
Survive until the transfer completes.

951
01:24:12,039 --> 01:24:13,960
I just double tapped that guy.

952
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:15,640
That guy got hit twice in the air.

953
01:24:23,079 --> 01:24:23,880
Dude, why?

954
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:25,880
Should I just drive away?

955
01:24:39,699 --> 01:24:40,739
Hack everything.

956
01:24:40,739 --> 01:24:41,939
I don't even know what I just did.

957
01:24:46,890 --> 01:24:47,449
Reload.

958
01:24:50,470 --> 01:24:52,789
Are you sure this isn't Far Cry 5?

959
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:54,949
It's the same damn company.

960
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:59,800
All right.

961
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:00,520
Nine seconds.

962
01:25:01,239 --> 01:25:04,439
All right.

963
01:25:04,439 --> 01:25:05,239
Nine seconds.

964
01:25:05,479 --> 01:25:06,119
Four seconds.

965
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,680
Three, two, one.

966
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:09,640
Transfer completed.

967
01:25:12,579 --> 01:25:13,060
Did I win?

968
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:17,399
Okay.

969
01:25:17,399 --> 01:25:18,279
Get to safety.

970
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:19,399
Oh, fuck.

971
01:25:19,399 --> 01:25:20,039
Get to safety.

972
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:30,619
I feel like this mission was very, very hard.

973
01:25:31,689 --> 01:25:34,569
Am I insane for thinking that this is like ridiculous?

974
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:37,270
Oh my god.

975
01:25:45,189 --> 01:25:46,789
Why would I do that to myself?

976
01:25:47,909 --> 01:25:49,750
Bitcoins in critical condition?

977
01:25:50,390 --> 01:25:54,329
I did it.

978
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:01,300
Get.

979
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:04,039
Get.

980
01:26:04,039 --> 01:26:04,840
I recruited.

981
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:07,539
Ha, I found you.

982
01:26:10,949 --> 01:26:11,989
They did find me.

983
01:26:13,659 --> 01:26:14,140
Give me this.

984
01:26:19,909 --> 01:26:30,649
Did the game save after that?

985
01:26:30,649 --> 01:26:33,369
Please tell me the game saved after that.

986
01:26:33,369 --> 01:26:34,170
Oh my god.

987
01:26:34,170 --> 01:26:35,210
Thank goodness.

988
01:26:35,210 --> 01:26:35,770
Point the way.

989
01:26:38,819 --> 01:26:39,539
Fuck is this?

990
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,180
A random fight on this?

991
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:45,140
Did I get invaded?

992
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:56,779
Adversary neutralized.

993
01:26:58,539 --> 01:27:00,380
What the fuck is happening in this game?

994
01:27:00,939 --> 01:27:05,529
Give me this pizza vehicle.

995
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:09,859
Thank you.

996
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:17,659
I...

997
01:27:17,659 --> 01:27:18,220
Give me...

998
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:19,340
Give me the vehicle.

999
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:20,140
Give me the vehicle.

1000
01:27:20,699 --> 01:27:21,579
Give me the vehicle.

1001
01:27:28,579 --> 01:27:30,500
Okay, now I've got a new recruit.

1002
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:40,460
Am I supposed to be the good guy?

1003
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:42,859
I have no idea what the fuck is going on, guys.

1004
01:27:42,859 --> 01:27:44,409
Can I recruit this person?

1005
01:27:44,409 --> 01:27:44,970
How can you tell?

1006
01:27:45,529 --> 01:27:54,760
Recruit Ruth.

1007
01:27:56,699 --> 01:28:01,500
Hey, Ruth.

1008
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:03,189
I got a mission for you.

1009
01:28:03,189 --> 01:28:06,970
Come here.

1010
01:28:12,630 --> 01:28:13,510
Recruit Andy.

1011
01:28:13,510 --> 01:28:14,310
Dermapress 4.

1012
01:28:20,789 --> 01:28:21,909
Don't stop recruiting.

1013
01:28:21,909 --> 01:28:22,470
Do a mission.

1014
01:28:23,909 --> 01:28:24,310
I...

1015
01:28:40,229 --> 01:28:41,829
What is with all the drones?

1016
01:28:42,949 --> 01:28:43,909
They're everywhere.

1017
01:28:46,630 --> 01:28:47,510
Why won't he blink?

1018
01:28:50,470 --> 01:28:53,880
All right, I'll help you.

1019
01:28:56,119 --> 01:28:58,680
Can I say, hey, get on the back?

1020
01:29:01,479 --> 01:29:02,760
All right, I'm gonna do the mission.

1021
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:03,560
I will.

1022
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:05,800
Can I say, get on the back?

1023
01:29:06,439 --> 01:29:07,960
Press 4.

1024
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:09,399
I pressed 4.

1025
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:13,500
All right, I'm gonna do the real mission.

1026
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:15,239
I'll go to music.

1027
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:17,239
No, I turned off music.

1028
01:29:17,239 --> 01:29:18,439
It's probably copyright shit.

1029
01:29:18,439 --> 01:29:19,800
I gotta be careful with that.

1030
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:30,329
Press 4 when you're off the bike.

1031
01:29:33,449 --> 01:29:33,770
4.

1032
01:29:35,109 --> 01:29:35,590
I pressed it.

1033
01:29:35,590 --> 01:29:36,550
Didn't do anything.

1034
01:29:36,550 --> 01:29:38,649
There's mail here or something.

1035
01:29:38,649 --> 01:29:39,689
What is this?

1036
01:29:39,689 --> 01:29:40,090
Deliver.

1037
01:29:41,930 --> 01:29:45,609
Operatives can take parcels from any pickup box and deliver them to the specific donation.

1038
01:29:46,539 --> 01:29:48,939
I don't know how that word came out.

1039
01:29:48,939 --> 01:29:54,170
Parcels can have up to three properties each with its own difficulty.

1040
01:29:54,170 --> 01:29:54,649
This is just...

1041
01:29:54,649 --> 01:29:54,890
All right.

1042
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:56,010
No, that's boring.

1043
01:29:56,010 --> 01:29:57,189
Give me the real shit.

1044
01:29:58,310 --> 01:29:59,270
No, I don't want to.

1045
01:29:59,270 --> 01:29:59,829
Give me the real shit.

1046
01:30:05,989 --> 01:30:07,750
Why can't you just take armored tanks?

1047
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:10,250
What?

1048
01:30:12,149 --> 01:30:13,750
Why am I able just to do this?

1049
01:30:14,489 --> 01:30:15,689
If the key's in the ignition...

1050
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:21,510
What is this?

1051
01:30:33,609 --> 01:30:34,250
Wait, I can...

1052
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:35,369
Let's turn on auto drive.

1053
01:30:39,909 --> 01:30:40,949
Why is it on driving?

1054
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:46,380
Am I in trouble?

1055
01:30:46,939 --> 01:30:57,050
Auto drive stops for cars.

1056
01:30:58,329 --> 01:30:59,050
Oh, well.

1057
01:30:59,770 --> 01:31:02,359
Get away from me.

1058
01:31:09,510 --> 01:31:10,069
Don't play...

1059
01:31:10,069 --> 01:31:10,789
I didn't do anything wrong.

1060
01:31:10,789 --> 01:31:11,270
Don't blame me.

1061
01:31:11,270 --> 01:31:12,149
It's a fucking computer.

1062
01:31:12,949 --> 01:31:14,539
Look, I'm not...

1063
01:31:14,539 --> 01:31:15,979
My hands aren't even on the wheel.

1064
01:31:15,979 --> 01:31:17,260
My hands are not even touching the wheel.

1065
01:31:17,819 --> 01:31:20,859
The cop is also on auto drive.

1066
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:24,409
All right, I'm gonna get in here to this mission.

1067
01:31:24,970 --> 01:31:26,569
I'm gonna lose this guy first.

1068
01:31:34,659 --> 01:31:35,460
You murdered somebody?

1069
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:36,579
I did not murder anybody.

1070
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:38,840
All right.

1071
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:40,359
You know what?

1072
01:31:41,079 --> 01:31:50,279
Good luck getting through that.

1073
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:00,569
Whoa!

1074
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:09,739
How do they not see us doing this?

1075
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:12,630
Get over here.

1076
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:18,739
Fuck!

1077
01:32:19,859 --> 01:32:22,300
What, did you just throw a bottle?

1078
01:32:22,939 --> 01:32:29,960
I fucking play Dark Souls a lot.

1079
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:52,789
Like that.

1080
01:32:52,789 --> 01:32:53,750
They didn't even look in here.

1081
01:32:53,750 --> 01:32:55,750
They just heard people getting the shit kicked out of them.

1082
01:33:00,729 --> 01:33:01,689
Sash over.

1083
01:33:01,689 --> 01:33:02,970
Nobody fucking here.

1084
01:33:02,970 --> 01:33:05,850
Is that a gun?

1085
01:33:06,170 --> 01:33:06,409
What?

1086
01:33:14,890 --> 01:33:15,770
Fortnite.

1087
01:33:15,770 --> 01:33:17,750
How do I get the car?

1088
01:33:19,859 --> 01:33:21,859
Okay, so we got to investigate this over here.

1089
01:33:21,859 --> 01:33:23,000
Pick this up.

1090
01:33:24,119 --> 01:33:25,159
Where is this?

1091
01:33:25,159 --> 01:33:30,020
Is it inside the building?

1092
01:33:34,789 --> 01:33:35,750
Press 4.

1093
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:36,390
I will.

1094
01:33:36,390 --> 01:33:40,939
Okay, I just stole money out of that.

1095
01:33:40,939 --> 01:33:42,220
I unlocked that.

1096
01:33:42,220 --> 01:33:42,939
Let's go in here.

1097
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:45,859
Oh shit, that's a bad guy.

1098
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:58,579
Shoot him in the head?

1099
01:33:58,579 --> 01:34:10,180
Both of them?

1100
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:10,739
Scream.

1101
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:20,229
Okay, so I need to get up top.

1102
01:34:20,229 --> 01:34:21,670
Investigate their replacement.

1103
01:34:21,670 --> 01:34:33,640
Did I miss something in here?

1104
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:38,420
This isn't your mission.

1105
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:40,100
I mean, it's something very obviously.

1106
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:41,300
What's the green thing up there?

1107
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:43,539
Something's blinking.

1108
01:34:43,539 --> 01:34:45,189
I can't literally go up.

1109
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:57,539
Doesn't that green thing mean there's something in here?

1110
01:34:57,539 --> 01:34:58,579
Oh shit, look at this.

1111
01:34:59,699 --> 01:35:00,659
Give me that.

1112
01:35:00,659 --> 01:35:01,479
How do I get that?

1113
01:35:01,479 --> 01:35:02,439
It's in the vent?

1114
01:35:02,439 --> 01:35:09,260
Oh damn, look at this right here.

1115
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:15,319
Spider.

1116
01:35:15,319 --> 01:35:21,720
Spider.

1117
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:25,670
Spider?

1118
01:35:25,670 --> 01:35:27,050
Why can I not use the spider?

1119
01:35:27,050 --> 01:35:27,529
Free.

1120
01:35:27,529 --> 01:35:33,220
That's going to be a shitload of money, isn't it?

1121
01:35:33,220 --> 01:35:35,420
Say the line.

1122
01:35:35,420 --> 01:35:35,979
Giant.

1123
01:35:35,979 --> 01:35:38,550
Why do you want me to say that?

1124
01:35:38,550 --> 01:35:39,670
That's such an old meme.

1125
01:35:39,670 --> 01:35:40,630
We're over it, aren't we?

1126
01:35:40,630 --> 01:35:51,479
All right, we're banging left.

1127
01:35:51,479 --> 01:35:54,149
And then there's going to be a package in here.

1128
01:35:54,149 --> 01:35:54,630
Look at it.

1129
01:35:54,630 --> 01:35:59,130
Pick it up.

1130
01:35:59,130 --> 01:35:59,930
Oh, that's tech.

1131
01:35:59,930 --> 01:36:01,689
Oh shit, that's 10 tech points.

1132
01:36:01,689 --> 01:36:03,340
Feign excitement.

1133
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:03,979
Feign excitement.

1134
01:36:03,979 --> 01:36:04,699
Feign excitement.

1135
01:36:04,699 --> 01:36:05,260
What the fuck?

1136
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:05,739
I...

1137
01:36:05,739 --> 01:36:06,380
Hey, chat.

1138
01:36:06,939 --> 01:36:08,060
We got 10 tech points.

1139
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:08,779
Feign excitement.

1140
01:36:09,829 --> 01:36:10,229
Got it.

1141
01:36:10,789 --> 01:36:14,069
All right, leave the spider in there.

1142
01:36:14,630 --> 01:36:22,310
All right, press 4.

1143
01:36:22,949 --> 01:36:27,479
So this is not a mission?

1144
01:36:28,470 --> 01:36:29,350
Why is it all...

1145
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:31,029
I mean, why is it yellow?

1146
01:36:31,029 --> 01:36:39,430
Okay, tech points.

1147
01:36:39,430 --> 01:36:42,180
Where's my car?

1148
01:36:42,180 --> 01:36:45,130
It's restricted though.

1149
01:36:45,130 --> 01:36:49,270
Does it get delivered to me or no?

1150
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:53,720
Is that it on the minimap over there?

1151
01:36:53,720 --> 01:37:01,539
Is this it?

1152
01:37:02,260 --> 01:37:04,020
Holy shit, this thing's fucking crazy.

1153
01:37:04,659 --> 01:37:05,220
Is this mine?

1154
01:37:05,939 --> 01:37:06,890
This is my car.

1155
01:37:09,670 --> 01:37:09,989
Wow.

1156
01:37:10,550 --> 01:37:14,939
Now get in.

1157
01:37:15,579 --> 01:37:19,619
You picked colorblind mode.

1158
01:37:20,180 --> 01:37:33,909
Oh, I think I did.

1159
01:37:33,909 --> 01:37:34,550
Menu.

1160
01:37:34,550 --> 01:37:36,140
I did.

1161
01:37:36,140 --> 01:37:37,260
Yeah, I did.

1162
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:39,510
Okay.

1163
01:37:39,510 --> 01:37:43,670
When I was setting it up, I was like, oh, that looks better.

1164
01:37:43,670 --> 01:37:44,949
Okay, that's better.

1165
01:37:44,949 --> 01:37:46,310
All right, that makes more sense now.

1166
01:37:46,310 --> 01:37:50,550
Okay, well, look, the mission marker is gold.

1167
01:37:51,350 --> 01:37:53,029
And I'm in a gold area.

1168
01:37:53,029 --> 01:37:53,510
Whatever.

1169
01:37:54,149 --> 01:38:02,899
All right, let's pump this.

1170
01:38:02,899 --> 01:38:06,949
Let's do it.

1171
01:38:15,369 --> 01:38:17,659
Glory.

1172
01:38:17,659 --> 01:38:19,340
Oh, I'm so glad we picked this lady.

1173
01:38:19,340 --> 01:38:28,699
Her car is sick.

1174
01:38:28,699 --> 01:38:29,420
Untracked mission.

1175
01:38:29,420 --> 01:38:31,340
Acquire Albion operations data.

1176
01:38:31,340 --> 01:38:32,140
No, fuck that.

1177
01:38:34,310 --> 01:38:35,750
Two FPS driving.

1178
01:38:39,189 --> 01:38:39,750
Come on, guys.

1179
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:44,069
You don't like this demonstration of iPad metal hardware?

1180
01:38:44,069 --> 01:38:46,069
Metal graphics processing unit?

1181
01:38:47,020 --> 01:38:49,500
It's like eight frames a second, but it sure looks pretty good.

1182
01:38:50,140 --> 01:38:53,159
Or an iPad.

1183
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:06,600
Spider-Man 2 graphics.

1184
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:07,800
Spider-Man 2 graphics.

1185
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:09,000
Spider-Man 2 graphics.

1186
01:39:22,939 --> 01:39:31,619
Is he just trying to make this look bad?

1187
01:39:31,619 --> 01:39:34,220
I don't think I have to do that.

1188
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:34,859
I think it just is.

1189
01:39:49,340 --> 01:39:49,979
All right, this is it.

1190
01:39:49,979 --> 01:39:53,020
Investigate the replacement of Ruth Sen.

1191
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:59,850
And aside from some heavily armed security guards, it's basically a ghost town.

1192
01:40:00,569 --> 01:40:01,850
Isn't that interesting?

1193
01:40:01,850 --> 01:40:02,329
Okay, let's go.

1194
01:40:02,329 --> 01:40:03,930
I don't think this replacement is also-

1195
01:40:03,930 --> 01:40:04,970
GTA IV.

1196
01:40:04,970 --> 01:40:06,489
Look around and see if you can figure out where-

1197
01:40:06,489 --> 01:40:08,619
Put it on the lowest setting.

1198
01:40:08,619 --> 01:40:09,579
It's not going to do anything.

1199
01:40:10,630 --> 01:40:12,069
We know that's not going to do anything.

1200
01:40:13,420 --> 01:40:14,939
Let me pee and figure out what I want to do.

1201
01:40:16,439 --> 01:40:19,529
I'll- I'll- I'm going to pee.

1202
01:42:05,130 --> 01:42:06,890
All right, let's try this again.

1203
01:42:20,949 --> 01:42:22,949
Grandma, please, you didn't update your drivers for the game

1204
01:42:22,949 --> 01:42:24,229
and are on the worst possible settings.

1205
01:42:24,229 --> 01:42:26,869
And you get annoyed at how bad it looks and how low the FPS is.

1206
01:42:26,869 --> 01:42:35,180
I'm going to update my drivers right now.

1207
01:42:35,180 --> 01:42:37,100
I'm going to update my driver stream.

1208
01:42:37,100 --> 01:42:40,250
Here we go.

1209
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:41,930
No, but you guys told me about the hotfix.

1210
01:42:41,930 --> 01:42:44,649
Ubisoft is making a hotfix because the game runs like shit.

1211
01:42:44,649 --> 01:42:56,119
Update your drivers, man.

1212
01:42:56,119 --> 01:43:00,020
What is this copypasta?

1213
01:43:00,020 --> 01:43:03,220
You know, hey, anytime you update drivers, don't you find it really sad

1214
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:07,380
when the default page that it lands on is the new cool one?

1215
01:43:07,380 --> 01:43:10,760
And you have to go down three drop-down menus and scroll?

1216
01:43:11,479 --> 01:43:12,199
Oh, fuck.

1217
01:43:12,199 --> 01:43:14,619
GeForce 10 series.

1218
01:43:14,699 --> 01:43:15,819
Oh, man.

1219
01:43:16,380 --> 01:43:20,970
All right, here we go.

1220
01:43:20,970 --> 01:43:22,890
Update my- the stream's probably going to crash.

1221
01:43:22,890 --> 01:43:23,609
Whatever, I'll be back.

1222
01:43:31,829 --> 01:43:32,550
Fuck the mods.

1223
01:43:32,550 --> 01:43:33,270
Why are you saying that?

1224
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:39,239
Well, how come- why is everybody bullying you?

1225
01:43:39,239 --> 01:43:39,800
It's all right.

1226
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:42,600
They don't mean it.

1227
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:45,859
That's what I tell myself every time I lie down and go to sleep.

1228
01:43:45,859 --> 01:43:46,739
They don't mean it.

1229
01:43:46,739 --> 01:43:47,460
They don't mean it.

1230
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:48,100
They don't mean it.

1231
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:52,890
They don't mean it.

1232
01:43:52,890 --> 01:43:57,529
And then I refresh the page and I see like tons of toxic comments.

1233
01:43:57,529 --> 01:43:58,680
I'm kidding.

1234
01:43:58,680 --> 01:43:59,560
I really don't.

1235
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:02,039
All right, here we go.

1236
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:04,439
It's time to update my graphics drivers.

1237
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:08,739
Are you guys ready for this?

1238
01:44:08,739 --> 01:44:10,100
Fucking POG moment.

1239
01:44:10,100 --> 01:44:10,659
Here it comes.

1240
01:44:15,619 --> 01:44:16,979
Oh, here it comes.

1241
01:44:21,689 --> 01:44:24,649
If the stream turns off, I will be back in 10 seconds.

1242
01:44:24,649 --> 01:44:34,710
I don't think it will, though.

1243
01:44:34,710 --> 01:44:35,510
Driver stream?

1244
01:44:35,510 --> 01:44:36,390
Oh, yeah.

1245
01:44:36,390 --> 01:44:39,449
I was here.

1246
01:44:41,079 --> 01:44:44,329
I was here for the driver stream.

1247
01:44:44,890 --> 01:44:54,619
I was here- I was against my will.

1248
01:44:54,619 --> 01:44:55,340
What?

1249
01:44:55,340 --> 01:45:03,939
Why- what are you doing here?

1250
01:45:03,939 --> 01:45:04,579
Here we go.

1251
01:45:04,579 --> 01:45:05,300
All right.

1252
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:06,579
Nvidia graphics driver.

1253
01:45:07,220 --> 01:45:08,659
Agree and continue.

1254
01:45:08,659 --> 01:45:09,859
Don't ban me.

1255
01:45:09,859 --> 01:45:11,380
Don't- don't delete my stream.

1256
01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:12,739
I'm coming back if it does.

1257
01:45:12,739 --> 01:45:14,260
I'll be right back if the stream turns off.

1258
01:45:14,260 --> 01:45:14,979
I promise.

1259
01:45:14,979 --> 01:45:20,220
This is the game ready driver.

1260
01:45:20,220 --> 01:45:21,020
I'm ready.

1261
01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:25,819
I got a six pack of Mountain Dew.

1262
01:45:26,380 --> 01:45:32,390
I'm ready to play Legion at the highest caliber 1080p graphics.

1263
01:45:32,390 --> 01:45:44,390
Oh, I got what?

1264
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:49,500
Wake me when it's- when it's over.

1265
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:49,979
I will.

1266
01:45:49,979 --> 01:45:50,859
I'll scream.

1267
01:45:50,859 --> 01:45:51,260
Oh, yeah.

1268
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:52,460
I'm going to yell right in the microphone.

1269
01:45:52,460 --> 01:45:53,020
I won't.

1270
01:45:53,020 --> 01:45:55,500
All right.

1271
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:56,859
It's installing right now.

1272
01:45:56,859 --> 01:45:57,260
Come on.

1273
01:45:57,260 --> 01:45:57,659
Let's go.

1274
01:45:58,460 --> 01:46:02,760
Vod Watchers.

1275
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:03,960
Skip five minutes.

1276
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:05,399
Actually, that's a pretty good point.

1277
01:46:05,399 --> 01:46:05,960
Yeah.

1278
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:07,479
Hey, Vod Watchers.

1279
01:46:07,479 --> 01:46:09,319
Just skip like two or three minutes.

1280
01:46:09,319 --> 01:46:12,279
Oh, hey, Vod Watchers.

1281
01:46:12,359 --> 01:46:14,840
Open up the next Vod that exists.

1282
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:19,210
Because that's- well, it might happen.

1283
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:22,600
See you in episode two.

1284
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:23,640
Stream two.

1285
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:27,430
Is it doing anything?

1286
01:46:27,430 --> 01:46:44,390
Why is it taking so long?

1287
01:46:44,390 --> 01:46:46,279
Hello?

1288
01:46:46,279 --> 01:46:48,680
Everything- everything went- everything just went black.

1289
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:52,220
Am I still live?

1290
01:46:52,220 --> 01:46:52,939
I don't know.

1291
01:46:52,939 --> 01:46:54,899
I have no idea.

1292
01:46:54,899 --> 01:46:55,460
I might be.

1293
01:47:00,619 --> 01:47:01,979
Hey, I'm still live.

1294
01:47:01,979 --> 01:47:02,300
We're good.

1295
01:47:02,300 --> 01:47:04,470
I didn't have to turn the stream off.

1296
01:47:04,470 --> 01:47:05,430
It has been installed.

1297
01:47:05,430 --> 01:47:06,630
We're ready to go.

1298
01:47:06,630 --> 01:47:06,949
All right.

1299
01:47:06,949 --> 01:47:07,350
Let's go.

1300
01:47:07,350 --> 01:47:07,670
Let's go.

1301
01:47:07,670 --> 01:47:08,069
Let's go.

1302
01:47:08,069 --> 01:47:08,390
Let's go.

1303
01:47:08,390 --> 01:47:08,710
Let's go.

1304
01:47:08,710 --> 01:47:09,109
Let's go.

1305
01:47:09,109 --> 01:47:09,430
Let's go.

1306
01:47:09,430 --> 01:47:09,829
Let's go.

1307
01:47:09,829 --> 01:47:12,939
You guys hyped Watch Dogs Legion?

1308
01:47:12,939 --> 01:47:19,640
Let's go.

1309
01:47:19,640 --> 01:47:24,699
Here it comes.

1310
01:47:24,699 --> 01:47:25,340
Fuck, dude.

1311
01:47:25,340 --> 01:47:26,539
I'm so excited for this game.

1312
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:32,760
You have no idea.

1313
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:33,079
Hold on.

1314
01:47:33,079 --> 01:47:35,479
My Epic Games launcher doesn't work anymore.

1315
01:47:35,479 --> 01:47:45,939
Here we go.

1316
01:47:45,939 --> 01:47:55,239
I implore you to give this game a chance.

1317
01:47:55,239 --> 01:47:57,479
I know you're being a haha funny YouTuber by killing everyone

1318
01:47:57,479 --> 01:47:59,000
and complaining about corporate Ubisoft,

1319
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,279
which I completely understand.

1320
01:48:00,279 --> 01:48:02,039
Please at least play through the first few tutorial missions

1321
01:48:02,039 --> 01:48:04,760
and see how social- how the social mechanics of this game are set up.

1322
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:06,840
And that- it's actually a lot like the Nemesis system.

1323
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:13,189
You know, the thing that you in chat absolutely loved.

1324
01:48:13,189 --> 01:48:14,470
I implore you.

1325
01:48:14,470 --> 01:48:17,260
Well, I'm- I'm not- I'm still going.

1326
01:48:17,260 --> 01:48:17,979
I'm still streaming.

1327
01:48:17,979 --> 01:48:19,260
I'm just waiting for the game to work.

1328
01:48:28,979 --> 01:48:30,579
Here it comes.

1329
01:48:30,579 --> 01:48:32,260
I promise this time it is coming.

1330
01:48:32,260 --> 01:48:37,210
Is that a coffee pasta or is that somebody's actual real opinion?

1331
01:48:37,210 --> 01:48:49,340
I'm going for it.

1332
01:48:49,340 --> 01:48:54,739
I'm gonna.

1333
01:48:54,739 --> 01:48:55,380
All right.

1334
01:48:55,380 --> 01:48:57,699
Stream starts now.

1335
01:48:57,699 --> 01:49:05,140
You heard the system booting.

1336
01:49:05,140 --> 01:49:05,619
There it is.

1337
01:49:06,819 --> 01:49:10,899
We have nude- we have the brand new today graphics drivers.

1338
01:49:10,899 --> 01:49:39,319
Why is everyone saying nude?

1339
01:49:39,319 --> 01:49:41,159
Continue.

1340
01:49:41,159 --> 01:49:45,739
Show it to me.

1341
01:49:45,739 --> 01:49:47,029
Loading screen.

1342
01:49:47,029 --> 01:49:47,590
Menu.

1343
01:49:47,590 --> 01:49:48,310
Loading screen.

1344
01:49:49,180 --> 01:49:50,300
60 FPS.

1345
01:49:50,300 --> 01:49:50,859
Incoming.

1346
01:50:08,039 --> 01:50:10,569
This is- this is not internet.

1347
01:50:10,569 --> 01:50:16,170
Oh, come on.

1348
01:50:16,979 --> 01:50:20,100
Did I download graphics drivers and they like fucking corrupted my system?

1349
01:50:29,050 --> 01:50:33,289
I'm gonna- I'm gonna put- I'm gonna load this thing up like they shoot the clay discs.

1350
01:50:33,289 --> 01:50:38,149
I'm just gonna pull.

1351
01:50:38,149 --> 01:50:40,460
I'm gonna shoot with a rocket launcher.

1352
01:50:40,460 --> 01:50:49,300
You downloaded the wrong drivers?

1353
01:50:49,300 --> 01:50:50,180
No, I didn't.

1354
01:50:50,180 --> 01:50:52,180
It's taking so much longer.

1355
01:50:52,180 --> 01:50:58,460
It's taking like three times as long.

1356
01:50:58,460 --> 01:50:59,020
Fuck.

1357
01:50:59,020 --> 01:51:06,789
Is it updating?

1358
01:51:06,789 --> 01:51:11,159
No, it's going.

1359
01:51:11,159 --> 01:51:12,680
It's- we're just gonna leave it alone.

1360
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:29,020
You need to restart the computer.

1361
01:51:29,020 --> 01:51:30,539
Oh, God.

1362
01:51:30,539 --> 01:51:37,380
I just saw it tick.

1363
01:51:37,380 --> 01:51:45,829
Hold on.

1364
01:51:45,909 --> 01:51:53,899
We- is it- we in?

1365
01:51:53,899 --> 01:51:56,779
I'm gonna give this 30 seconds that I'm restarting my fucking computer.

1366
01:51:56,779 --> 01:51:58,729
Pain in the ass.

1367
01:51:58,729 --> 01:52:16,710
And you guys wonder why like consoles sell so well.

1368
01:52:16,710 --> 01:52:17,590
It is moving though.

1369
01:52:17,590 --> 01:52:26,659
It is.

1370
01:52:26,659 --> 01:52:29,619
And- and everybody else like curious to see what happens when it gets to the end.

1371
01:52:29,619 --> 01:52:39,159
Use the talk shit and it's done.

1372
01:52:39,159 --> 01:52:40,329
Yes.

1373
01:52:40,329 --> 01:52:40,810
We're in.

1374
01:52:40,810 --> 01:52:43,699
How did everything go under?

1375
01:52:43,699 --> 01:52:45,140
Some fresh meat.

1376
01:52:45,140 --> 01:52:45,859
Ready?

1377
01:52:45,859 --> 01:52:57,590
What the fuck happened to that guy?

1378
01:52:57,590 --> 01:52:58,569
All right.

1379
01:52:58,569 --> 01:52:59,930
Game ready driver.

1380
01:52:59,930 --> 01:53:03,779
What's going on over here?

1381
01:53:10,170 --> 01:53:14,890
Uh, this lady.

1382
01:53:14,890 --> 01:53:16,890
That's a lot.

1383
01:53:16,890 --> 01:53:32,390
How many times are you gonna do this?

1384
01:53:32,390 --> 01:53:36,229
Got him.

1385
01:53:36,229 --> 01:53:37,109
Now go, run!

1386
01:53:37,109 --> 01:54:00,170
All right, I'm good.

1387
01:54:00,170 --> 01:54:02,359
Pad frame rate.

1388
01:54:02,359 --> 01:54:06,170
Oh, the FPS is so bad.

1389
01:54:06,170 --> 01:54:15,590
It is so bad.

1390
01:54:15,590 --> 01:54:18,630
Lower all the- they're already pretty fucking low, man.

1391
01:54:18,630 --> 01:54:39,270
I can't- they don't even let you put it on low.

1392
01:54:39,270 --> 01:54:47,850
Why is that on?

1393
01:54:47,850 --> 01:54:48,250
Fuck it.

1394
01:54:48,250 --> 01:54:51,380
We're going- we're going 2001.

1395
01:54:51,380 --> 01:54:54,979
Full screen mode?

1396
01:54:54,979 --> 01:55:00,649
Are you telling me that's the bullshit that's gonna be a problem?

1397
01:55:00,649 --> 01:55:02,859
Better not be.

1398
01:55:02,859 --> 01:55:24,020
This better not be the fucking problem.

1399
01:55:24,020 --> 01:55:31,880
They're actually running better.

1400
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:33,159
Use DirectX 11?

1401
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:40,520
Trouble- trouble to shoot the streamer's video game so it doesn't look like GTA 3 The Stream.

1402
01:55:46,489 --> 01:55:47,850
Put it on DX 11?

1403
01:55:47,850 --> 01:55:48,970
How do I do that, though?

1404
01:55:48,970 --> 01:55:50,649
How do I put it on DirectX 11?

1405
01:55:55,899 --> 01:55:56,939
I don't know how to do that.

1406
01:55:59,100 --> 01:56:01,180
I'm not gonna lower the resolution.

1407
01:56:05,989 --> 01:56:06,949
Is it in the options?

1408
01:56:06,949 --> 01:56:07,510
Options?

1409
01:56:07,510 --> 01:56:10,470
Is it in video?

1410
01:56:10,470 --> 01:56:12,470
GTX 1080.

1411
01:56:12,470 --> 01:56:17,979
It's in the video settings.

1412
01:56:17,979 --> 01:56:19,689
Field of view.

1413
01:56:19,689 --> 01:56:21,050
F- monitor refresh rate.

1414
01:56:21,050 --> 01:56:21,850
Resolution.

1415
01:56:21,850 --> 01:56:25,819
Where do you see that?

1416
01:56:27,529 --> 01:56:29,369
Look, I got plenty of VRAM.

1417
01:56:29,369 --> 01:56:33,909
DirectX 11.

1418
01:56:33,909 --> 01:56:35,590
Oh god fucking damn it.

1419
01:57:01,689 --> 01:57:04,310
So, how was your day today?

1420
01:57:04,310 --> 01:57:08,699
Worst stream 2020.

1421
01:57:08,699 --> 01:57:10,380
Contender incoming.

1422
01:57:10,380 --> 01:57:12,840
I'll be your host for the evening.

1423
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:15,979
Streamer left.

1424
01:57:15,979 --> 01:57:22,380
He walked out after he had to restart his game 15 times and went to crash twice in the tutorial.

1425
01:57:22,380 --> 01:57:27,739
He had to download game-ready Legion drivers.

1426
01:57:27,739 --> 01:57:30,140
He since has gone out of the room.

1427
01:57:30,140 --> 01:57:35,619
I'll be playing now.

1428
01:57:35,619 --> 01:57:40,949
I'm a better streamer.

1429
01:57:40,949 --> 01:57:42,310
Restart your fucking computer.

1430
01:57:43,750 --> 01:57:45,590
If I restart the computer, the stream goes off.

1431
01:57:46,390 --> 01:57:49,670
I need like a stream battery that keeps the stream turned on.

1432
01:57:49,670 --> 01:57:58,340
Let's go.

1433
01:57:58,340 --> 01:57:59,220
DX 11.

1434
01:57:59,220 --> 01:58:00,100
Not DX 12.

1435
01:58:00,100 --> 01:58:00,819
That's the bad one.

1436
01:58:00,819 --> 01:58:01,539
That's the one that sucks.

1437
01:58:01,539 --> 01:58:03,220
That's the one that causes problems for every PC.

1438
01:58:03,220 --> 01:58:04,180
I remember that.

1439
01:58:04,180 --> 01:58:17,100
You're number five in the Watch Dogs category.

1440
01:58:17,100 --> 01:58:17,899
Fuck.

1441
01:58:17,899 --> 01:58:22,859
Look at how lightning quick that just loaded.

1442
01:58:22,859 --> 01:58:24,060
Did you see that?

1443
01:58:24,060 --> 01:58:26,420
This is the fastest I've ever seen a loading screen start.

1444
01:58:26,420 --> 01:58:57,369
Remember, do you have an SSD?

1445
01:58:57,369 --> 01:58:58,970
Yes, I have three of them.

1446
01:58:59,050 --> 01:59:02,409
All right.

1447
01:59:02,409 --> 01:59:06,810
My computer might be a few years old, but it's not like I have hard drives in here.

1448
01:59:06,810 --> 01:59:10,600
He's fuming right now.

1449
01:59:10,600 --> 01:59:16,789
Actually, that's kind of entertaining in a way for me.

1450
01:59:16,789 --> 01:59:18,069
DX 11 Andy.

1451
01:59:18,069 --> 01:59:27,670
You're the second highest English-speaking Watch Dogs streamer.

1452
01:59:27,670 --> 01:59:28,869
Who's the first?

1453
01:59:28,869 --> 01:59:30,069
Why can't I be number one?

1454
01:59:48,649 --> 01:59:50,329
Mechanical Drive Matthew.

1455
01:59:50,890 --> 01:59:51,449
Stop.

1456
01:59:51,449 --> 01:59:51,850
All right.

1457
01:59:51,850 --> 01:59:52,409
This is it.

1458
01:59:52,409 --> 01:59:54,090
I'm getting in here and I'm playing.

1459
01:59:54,090 --> 01:59:58,010
And if not, I'll hold the power button off on my fucking computer.

1460
01:59:58,010 --> 01:59:59,529
I swear to God, if it's still fucked up.

1461
01:59:59,529 --> 02:00:01,770
And I'm going to turn it back on to turn and come back in five minutes.

1462
02:00:01,770 --> 02:00:18,659
You can't be number one because the other guy's not doing a troubleshooting stream.

1463
02:00:18,659 --> 02:00:19,060
Shit.

1464
02:00:19,060 --> 02:00:20,180
I need a better computer.

1465
02:00:20,180 --> 02:00:21,859
I need a better computer.

1466
02:00:21,859 --> 02:00:23,720
I gotta get a better computer now.

1467
02:00:41,270 --> 02:00:42,390
Oh, shit.

1468
02:00:42,390 --> 02:00:46,039
And I think it just needed a few minutes to load.

1469
02:00:46,039 --> 02:00:49,510
Dude, this looks fine.

1470
02:00:49,510 --> 02:00:55,260
This looks pretty.

1471
02:00:55,260 --> 02:00:56,060
This looks okay.

1472
02:00:56,060 --> 02:00:59,979
This looks all right.

1473
02:00:59,979 --> 02:01:00,300
Wait.

1474
02:01:00,300 --> 02:01:01,100
Why is it?

1475
02:01:01,100 --> 02:01:02,060
What is it doing that?

1476
02:01:02,060 --> 02:01:05,220
No, no, no.

1477
02:01:05,220 --> 02:01:05,539
Trust me.

1478
02:01:05,539 --> 02:01:05,859
Trust me.

1479
02:01:05,859 --> 02:01:06,260
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1480
02:01:06,260 --> 02:01:09,020
Wait for it to refresh a little bit.

1481
02:01:09,020 --> 02:01:10,630
Bingo.

1482
02:01:10,630 --> 02:01:11,350
Bingo.

1483
02:01:11,350 --> 02:01:12,390
We got 60 FPS.

1484
02:01:12,390 --> 02:01:12,789
Let's go.

1485
02:01:20,819 --> 02:01:23,659
Fuck.

1486
02:01:23,659 --> 02:01:24,619
What happened?

1487
02:01:27,750 --> 02:01:29,109
Skipped frames detected.

1488
02:01:29,109 --> 02:01:29,829
What's doing this?

1489
02:01:29,829 --> 02:01:30,550
Why is it doing this?

1490
02:01:30,550 --> 02:01:31,270
What's going on?

1491
02:01:40,569 --> 02:01:41,130
I'll be back.

1492
02:01:41,130 --> 02:01:42,090
Give me five minutes.

1493
02:01:42,090 --> 02:01:42,970
Fucking turn the computer.

1494
02:01:42,970 --> 02:01:43,850
I'm just turning the computer off.

1495
02:01:43,850 --> 02:01:44,890
I'm not even going to turn the stream off.

1496
02:01:44,890 --> 02:01:46,250
I'm just turning off the computer.

1497
02:01:46,250 --> 02:01:47,130
I'm restarting.

1498
02:01:47,130 --> 02:01:49,050
I can't even restart my computer.

1499
02:01:49,050 --> 02:01:50,329
The Windows button doesn't even work.

1500
02:01:50,329 --> 02:01:54,810
I'm back into...

1501
02:01:54,810 --> 02:01:57,560
I'm just hitting the power button.

1502
02:01:57,560 --> 02:01:58,680
I'll be back in two minutes.

1503
02:01:59,640 --> 02:02:01,560
Come back and watch my watchdog streams.

1504
02:02:01,560 --> 02:02:02,359
I'm number two.

1505
02:02:02,359 --> 02:02:03,000
God damn it.

1506
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:04,600
I'm going to be number one.

1507
02:02:04,600 --> 02:02:06,199
Hey, hey, hey.

1508
02:02:06,199 --> 02:02:06,600
I'm here.

1509
02:02:06,600 --> 02:02:07,319
I'm here.

1510
02:02:07,319 --> 02:02:07,800
Number two.

1511
02:02:07,800 --> 02:02:08,199
Come on.

1512
02:02:08,199 --> 02:02:10,199
I'm the number two guy right here.

1513
02:02:10,199 --> 02:02:11,500
Hey, I'm back.

1514
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:11,739
I'm back.

1515
02:02:11,739 --> 02:02:12,060
I'm back.

1516
02:02:12,060 --> 02:02:12,380
OK.

1517
02:02:12,380 --> 02:02:13,500
I restarted the stream.

1518
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:14,949
I restarted.

1519
02:02:14,949 --> 02:02:16,710
Watchdog's Legion is now starting.

1520
02:02:16,710 --> 02:02:18,460
Here we go.

1521
02:02:18,460 --> 02:02:19,180
It's coming.

1522
02:02:19,180 --> 02:02:21,319
Somebody said, wow,

1523
02:02:21,319 --> 02:02:22,600
Shroud's stream looks great.

1524
02:02:23,399 --> 02:02:24,039
I'm sure it does.

1525
02:02:24,039 --> 02:02:25,319
I'm sure it looks fantastic.

1526
02:02:25,319 --> 02:02:26,680
I'm sure it looks really good.

1527
02:02:26,680 --> 02:02:27,159
But mine...

1528
02:02:28,119 --> 02:02:29,560
I'm going to get a better computer soon

1529
02:02:29,560 --> 02:02:30,760
and then it'll be better.

1530
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:45,909
I left for an hour.

1531
02:02:45,909 --> 02:02:46,630
What have I missed?

1532
02:02:49,210 --> 02:02:50,010
Not a whole lot.

1533
02:02:50,970 --> 02:02:54,090
Not a whole lot.

1534
02:02:54,090 --> 02:02:54,569
All right.

1535
02:02:55,369 --> 02:02:56,810
Watchdog's Legion.

1536
02:02:56,810 --> 02:02:57,449
Here we go.

1537
02:02:57,449 --> 02:03:01,020
I'm going to get that 3090.

1538
02:03:01,020 --> 02:03:02,060
I'm going to get like a...

1539
02:03:02,060 --> 02:03:05,100
I'm going to get like a 35-core PC.

1540
02:03:05,100 --> 02:03:06,539
A 3090.

1541
02:03:06,539 --> 02:03:08,699
Two of them.

1542
02:03:08,699 --> 02:03:09,819
I'm going to have to have

1543
02:03:09,819 --> 02:03:12,779
a dedicated energy account

1544
02:03:12,779 --> 02:03:13,659
just for this computer.

1545
02:03:13,659 --> 02:03:14,619
I swear to God.

1546
02:03:14,619 --> 02:03:16,180
You lost 2,000 viewers.

1547
02:03:16,180 --> 02:03:16,500
Sorry.

1548
02:03:16,500 --> 02:03:17,939
They'll be back in like 10 minutes.

1549
02:03:17,939 --> 02:03:26,840
OK.

1550
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:28,199
We have restarted.

1551
02:03:29,140 --> 02:03:31,939
I have dropped my stream settings

1552
02:03:31,939 --> 02:03:34,340
to be able to handle this.

1553
02:03:34,340 --> 02:03:36,500
The game has been restarted.

1554
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:37,220
I'm ready.

1555
02:03:37,220 --> 02:03:38,579
It's in DirectX 11.

1556
02:03:42,260 --> 02:03:43,300
I have the new driver.

1557
02:03:43,300 --> 02:03:45,460
I'm ready to play Watchdog's Legion

1558
02:03:45,460 --> 02:03:46,579
on launch day.

1559
02:03:46,579 --> 02:03:49,220
We're on V-Sync, you idiot.

1560
02:03:51,739 --> 02:03:52,859
Isn't turning on V-Sync

1561
02:03:52,859 --> 02:03:55,180
the same thing as like saying Voldemort?

1562
02:03:56,060 --> 02:03:57,579
I thought all gamers on PC

1563
02:03:57,579 --> 02:03:58,699
weren't allowed to do that.

1564
02:03:58,699 --> 02:04:02,180
Here we go.

1565
02:04:02,180 --> 02:04:03,060
Let's take a look.

1566
02:04:03,060 --> 02:04:03,380
OK.

1567
02:04:05,350 --> 02:04:11,020
Continue.

1568
02:04:11,020 --> 02:04:11,260
Wait.

1569
02:04:11,260 --> 02:04:11,819
I'll do it.

1570
02:04:11,819 --> 02:04:12,060
OK.

1571
02:04:12,060 --> 02:04:12,779
Let me do that first.

1572
02:04:14,920 --> 02:04:15,399
Video.

1573
02:04:16,520 --> 02:04:18,500
Full screen.

1574
02:04:18,500 --> 02:04:18,979
V-Sync.

1575
02:04:19,939 --> 02:04:20,340
Normal.

1576
02:04:21,350 --> 02:04:21,909
I guess.

1577
02:04:21,909 --> 02:04:22,310
OK.

1578
02:04:22,310 --> 02:04:22,710
Normal.

1579
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:25,899
Here we go.

1580
02:04:27,399 --> 02:04:27,880
Campaign.

1581
02:04:28,439 --> 02:04:29,319
Continue.

1582
02:04:29,319 --> 02:04:30,149
Let's go.

1583
02:04:59,640 --> 02:04:59,880
Hey.

1584
02:05:03,909 --> 02:05:04,470
All right.

1585
02:05:08,939 --> 02:05:10,220
It looks just as bad

1586
02:05:10,220 --> 02:05:17,819
as it did 20 minutes ago.

1587
02:05:17,819 --> 02:05:19,739
Dude, why is it doing this?

1588
02:05:20,300 --> 02:05:32,279
Wait, are we good?

1589
02:05:32,279 --> 02:05:32,520
No.

1590
02:05:38,739 --> 02:05:41,220
My computer can't handle Watchdog's Legion.

1591
02:05:41,220 --> 02:05:42,020
I can't.

1592
02:05:42,020 --> 02:05:43,399
I just can't do it.

1593
02:05:43,399 --> 02:05:45,239
My CPU can't run it.

1594
02:05:45,239 --> 02:05:46,680
I can't run it.

1595
02:05:46,680 --> 02:05:50,489
I can run it on DX12.

1596
02:05:58,149 --> 02:05:58,710
No.

1597
02:05:58,710 --> 02:06:00,550
I don't want to do this again.

1598
02:06:01,109 --> 02:06:01,989
DX12.

1599
02:06:01,989 --> 02:06:02,710
And I'm going to put like

1600
02:06:02,710 --> 02:06:04,470
the geometry on high.

1601
02:06:04,470 --> 02:06:12,579
Don't restart yet.

1602
02:06:12,579 --> 02:06:12,899
Hold on.

1603
02:06:14,869 --> 02:06:16,390
Resolution is 1080.

1604
02:06:16,390 --> 02:06:26,229
It's the PC patch, not your PC.

1605
02:06:26,229 --> 02:06:27,189
What the fuck?

1606
02:06:27,189 --> 02:06:29,819
Go to 720.

1607
02:06:29,819 --> 02:06:30,779
No, that's too ugly.

1608
02:06:30,779 --> 02:06:31,500
I can't.

1609
02:06:31,500 --> 02:06:34,569
Turn off V-Sync.

1610
02:06:34,569 --> 02:06:34,810
All right.

1611
02:06:34,810 --> 02:06:35,770
Here's what I'm going to do.

1612
02:06:35,770 --> 02:06:38,920
I'm going to go back to DX Revert.

1613
02:06:38,920 --> 02:06:41,399
Let's go back to DX12.

1614
02:06:41,399 --> 02:06:43,180
I'm going to put the geometry.

1615
02:06:43,180 --> 02:06:43,979
I'm going to keep this here.

1616
02:06:45,220 --> 02:06:45,539
Everything.

1617
02:06:46,739 --> 02:06:50,260
We're going to put some load on the GPU.

1618
02:06:52,869 --> 02:06:53,590
Major load.

1619
02:06:53,590 --> 02:06:55,829
No, I don't want major load on the CPU.

1620
02:06:55,829 --> 02:07:00,260
Why does my CPU suck?

1621
02:07:03,220 --> 02:07:08,220
My CPU doesn't even suck, though.

1622
02:07:08,380 --> 02:07:11,340
I have a 6-core, like 6,800.

1623
02:07:17,340 --> 02:07:18,140
If this don't work,

1624
02:07:18,140 --> 02:07:19,260
if this still looks like shit,

1625
02:07:19,260 --> 02:07:20,699
then I'm just going to do tier lists

1626
02:07:20,699 --> 02:07:22,220
for like two or three hours.

1627
02:07:22,220 --> 02:07:24,229
Get them ready.

1628
02:07:24,229 --> 02:07:25,510
Get your favorite tier lists ready

1629
02:07:25,510 --> 02:07:26,869
because Watch Dogs Legion

1630
02:07:26,869 --> 02:07:28,789
fucking throw it into the trash.

1631
02:07:28,789 --> 02:07:51,529
Here we go.

1632
02:07:51,529 --> 02:07:53,289
Six cores, not enough in 2020.

1633
02:07:53,289 --> 02:07:54,409
That's plenty of cores.

1634
02:07:54,409 --> 02:07:55,449
That's a lot of cores.

1635
02:07:55,449 --> 02:07:56,810
I just got $50 for like

1636
02:07:56,810 --> 02:07:58,489
the worst stream I've done all month.

1637
02:07:58,489 --> 02:08:04,329
It's from Phylactery Lich.

1638
02:08:04,329 --> 02:08:06,149
Thank you, Phylactery.

1639
02:08:06,149 --> 02:08:07,670
5,000 bits.

1640
02:08:07,670 --> 02:08:09,500
Remember, please buy a new computer.

1641
02:08:09,500 --> 02:08:10,539
I'm begging you.

1642
02:08:10,539 --> 02:08:11,979
Yeah, I am.

1643
02:08:12,460 --> 02:08:15,380
I just was waiting until like 3090s

1644
02:08:15,380 --> 02:08:17,060
and 3080s were back in stock

1645
02:08:17,060 --> 02:08:19,939
and the new Risen processors just dropped.

1646
02:08:19,939 --> 02:08:21,779
This shit's happening like this weekend.

1647
02:08:21,779 --> 02:08:22,659
Like I'm this day.

1648
02:08:22,659 --> 02:08:28,729
I'm going to get a supercomputer.

1649
02:08:28,729 --> 02:08:30,250
I'm coming back to Watch Dogs Legion

1650
02:08:30,250 --> 02:08:31,050
when I get this new computer

1651
02:08:31,050 --> 02:08:32,250
and we're going to put everything on Ultra

1652
02:08:32,250 --> 02:08:32,890
and I'm just going to run around

1653
02:08:32,890 --> 02:08:34,250
and just punch people and laugh

1654
02:08:34,250 --> 02:08:35,770
and say, see where we are.

1655
02:08:35,770 --> 02:08:36,890
All right, let's try it.

1656
02:08:36,890 --> 02:08:38,229
Get your tier lists ready

1657
02:08:38,229 --> 02:08:40,390
because I'm about to fucking have a meltdown.

1658
02:08:40,390 --> 02:08:56,310
What about AI Dungeon?

1659
02:08:56,310 --> 02:08:57,270
Well, maybe.

1660
02:08:57,270 --> 02:09:15,050
You made your, uh, put,

1661
02:09:15,050 --> 02:09:15,930
went down to 70.

1662
02:09:16,810 --> 02:09:21,289
Just try and stop me.

1663
02:09:21,289 --> 02:09:22,250
Okay. Well, it runs.

1664
02:09:24,710 --> 02:09:26,390
It runs, but not very good.

1665
02:09:31,130 --> 02:09:33,050
I fucking swear to God.

1666
02:09:33,050 --> 02:09:35,939
Dude, this ain't my computer.

1667
02:09:35,939 --> 02:09:37,060
This ain't my computer.

1668
02:09:37,060 --> 02:09:37,619
It's not.

1669
02:09:37,619 --> 02:09:38,340
This is no way.

1670
02:09:38,340 --> 02:09:39,220
That's not my computer.

1671
02:09:39,220 --> 02:09:40,500
This is fucking dumb game.

1672
02:09:41,699 --> 02:09:43,779
There's no fucking way this is my PC.

1673
02:09:54,170 --> 02:09:55,529
He's in denial.

1674
02:09:55,529 --> 02:09:56,649
No, it can't be.

1675
02:09:58,470 --> 02:10:00,470
No, other streamers are good.

1676
02:10:00,470 --> 02:10:01,029
But why?

1677
02:10:01,029 --> 02:10:02,470
Why am I not good?

1678
02:10:02,470 --> 02:10:03,670
Why am I not good?

1679
02:10:04,229 --> 02:10:05,859
What the heck?

1680
02:10:05,859 --> 02:10:07,220
It's not fair.

1681
02:10:07,220 --> 02:10:08,739
I was supposed to be number two.

1682
02:10:08,739 --> 02:10:09,939
I was the number two guy.

1683
02:10:09,939 --> 02:10:10,739
He was supposed to be me.

1684
02:10:11,460 --> 02:10:17,220
Put it on XP compatibility mode.

1685
02:10:21,460 --> 02:10:21,779
Fuck.

1686
02:10:22,500 --> 02:10:23,939
It was supposed to be me, you know?

1687
02:10:23,939 --> 02:10:24,979
I was supposed to be that guy.

1688
02:10:24,979 --> 02:10:26,979
I was supposed to be the number two spot.

1689
02:10:26,979 --> 02:10:28,810
I was going to be able to look over

1690
02:10:28,810 --> 02:10:30,250
and see like Shroud right there

1691
02:10:30,250 --> 02:10:32,970
and be like, Shroud, Pog.

1692
02:10:32,970 --> 02:10:34,409
This stream looks so good too.

1693
02:10:34,409 --> 02:10:36,569
And I need like a good stream like his.

1694
02:10:36,569 --> 02:10:36,890
All right.

1695
02:10:37,449 --> 02:10:40,899
I'm doing this one more time.

1696
02:10:40,899 --> 02:10:50,760
I have to try one more time.

1697
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:51,720
Why? Why?

1698
02:10:51,720 --> 02:10:53,720
Because it's called, I've, okay.

1699
02:10:53,800 --> 02:10:59,210
I lost $99,999.

1700
02:10:59,210 --> 02:11:05,189
I have $1 left and I'm putting it on black.

1701
02:11:05,189 --> 02:11:07,029
And if it hits, then I get $2.

1702
02:11:08,090 --> 02:11:20,539
And at least I got a victory out of this.

1703
02:11:20,539 --> 02:11:21,579
You're in denial.

1704
02:11:21,579 --> 02:11:22,140
I know.

1705
02:11:22,140 --> 02:11:23,100
That's okay though.

1706
02:11:23,100 --> 02:11:26,149
But okay, here's the really wacky thing, okay?

1707
02:11:26,949 --> 02:11:30,869
My CPU usage right now is like 19%.

1708
02:11:30,869 --> 02:11:32,840
What the hell's happening?

1709
02:11:33,899 --> 02:11:37,210
This is not like putting a bottleneck on my computer.

1710
02:11:37,210 --> 02:11:38,250
This is wacky shit.

1711
02:11:38,250 --> 02:11:40,250
My CPU is at 22% right now.

1712
02:11:40,329 --> 02:11:43,590
This is wacky shit.

1713
02:11:43,590 --> 02:11:44,550
Don't you think?

1714
02:11:44,550 --> 02:11:54,119
I want to see what it is.

1715
02:12:00,859 --> 02:12:01,899
It's zany.

1716
02:12:01,899 --> 02:12:03,100
Oh, Twitch staff is here.

1717
02:12:03,100 --> 02:12:04,460
I'm going to be on good behavior.

1718
02:12:13,579 --> 02:12:14,859
If you use liquid, what?

1719
02:12:15,420 --> 02:12:18,199
Open up a benchmark.

1720
02:12:18,199 --> 02:12:26,539
It's because you have a pirated copy of the game.

1721
02:12:29,100 --> 02:12:30,220
That's what I was doing.

1722
02:12:31,699 --> 02:12:35,140
You guys know how many like subs this channel has

1723
02:12:35,140 --> 02:12:37,619
and I'm pirating Watch Dogs Legion.

1724
02:12:40,300 --> 02:12:41,579
I don't want to risk too much.

1725
02:12:55,020 --> 02:12:55,420
Okay.

1726
02:12:55,420 --> 02:12:56,380
Nobody move.

1727
02:12:56,859 --> 02:12:57,500
I'm not going to move.

1728
02:13:02,920 --> 02:13:03,239
Okay.

1729
02:13:04,869 --> 02:13:06,470
By the way, view count rising.

1730
02:13:07,350 --> 02:13:09,270
View count rising.

1731
02:13:09,270 --> 02:13:09,829
Bye.

1732
02:13:09,829 --> 02:13:10,789
Everybody stop buying.

1733
02:13:11,350 --> 02:13:12,310
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.

1734
02:13:14,300 --> 02:13:24,970
View count fucking skyrocketing.

1735
02:13:24,970 --> 02:13:25,289
All right.

1736
02:13:25,289 --> 02:13:25,770
I can play.

1737
02:13:27,609 --> 02:13:27,850
All right.

1738
02:13:27,850 --> 02:13:28,090
We're good.

1739
02:13:28,090 --> 02:13:28,409
We're good.

1740
02:13:28,409 --> 02:13:28,729
We're good.

1741
02:13:28,729 --> 02:13:29,449
We're good.

1742
02:13:29,449 --> 02:13:29,850
Let's go.

1743
02:13:43,100 --> 02:13:44,140
It works, right?

1744
02:13:44,140 --> 02:13:45,100
We got decent frames.

1745
02:13:53,079 --> 02:13:54,119
We got decent frames.

1746
02:13:54,119 --> 02:13:56,279
It just looks like dog shit.

1747
02:13:56,920 --> 02:14:03,880
Employer.

1748
02:14:03,880 --> 02:14:06,199
And aside from some heavily armed security guards,

1749
02:14:06,199 --> 02:14:07,640
it's basically a ghost town.

1750
02:14:07,640 --> 02:14:09,560
Decent frames, but at what cost?

1751
02:14:09,560 --> 02:14:09,800
All right.

1752
02:14:09,800 --> 02:14:10,199
We're good.

1753
02:14:10,199 --> 02:14:10,359
We're good.

1754
02:14:10,359 --> 02:14:10,680
We're good.

1755
02:14:10,680 --> 02:14:10,840
Let's go.

1756
02:14:10,840 --> 02:14:11,319
Let's go.

1757
02:14:11,319 --> 02:14:11,720
I'm ready.

1758
02:14:11,720 --> 02:14:12,119
I'm playing.

1759
02:14:17,829 --> 02:14:18,550
Okay.

1760
02:14:18,550 --> 02:14:19,430
Restricted area.

1761
02:14:19,430 --> 02:14:20,470
Investigate the replacement.

1762
02:14:21,029 --> 02:14:27,140
Take a look at security cameras.

1763
02:14:27,140 --> 02:14:28,260
Time to hack the world.

1764
02:14:29,449 --> 02:14:30,250
Hack the world.

1765
02:14:31,050 --> 02:14:32,890
Only if you have a graphics card

1766
02:14:32,890 --> 02:14:36,329
that's at least in the 2000 generation of Nvidia.

1767
02:14:36,329 --> 02:14:38,489
You got anything less than that?

1768
02:14:38,489 --> 02:14:40,170
You don't get to hack the world.

1769
02:14:40,170 --> 02:14:43,609
Well, you do, but you get to kind of slowly get to hack the world.

1770
02:14:44,250 --> 02:14:48,729
Pretty bad frames.

1771
02:14:54,939 --> 02:14:55,579
Huge bits.

1772
02:14:56,140 --> 02:14:59,500
Hey, Master Fleet, thanks for the $50 for the PC fund.

1773
02:15:00,539 --> 02:15:00,939
Don't worry.

1774
02:15:00,939 --> 02:15:01,659
I'm going to get one.

1775
02:15:08,229 --> 02:15:09,109
I'm going to take this guy down.

1776
02:15:09,750 --> 02:15:13,609
Thank you for the $50 of this insane amount of money.

1777
02:15:14,250 --> 02:15:15,770
Can I kick this thing when it's on the ground?

1778
02:15:16,409 --> 02:15:20,949
Who the fuck is this?

1779
02:15:33,130 --> 02:15:35,210
You know when you just get taken out of a groove

1780
02:15:35,210 --> 02:15:39,130
because you spent the last 40 minutes trying to get the game to run?

1781
02:15:39,689 --> 02:15:51,000
What the hell was that?

1782
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:51,560
Nice trip.

1783
02:15:52,119 --> 02:16:02,500
I fucking hate the drones.

1784
02:16:02,500 --> 02:16:03,460
The drones are stupid.

1785
02:16:03,460 --> 02:16:04,579
What a dumb thing to have in the game.

1786
02:16:25,300 --> 02:16:25,859
Sit down!

1787
02:16:26,579 --> 02:16:27,300
You too.

1788
02:16:27,300 --> 02:16:28,500
Who—this is like a CEO.

1789
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:29,300
Who the fuck is this?

1790
02:16:29,300 --> 02:16:40,180
I don't know, battery power?

1791
02:16:42,729 --> 02:16:46,409
Dude, I haven't even done the first mission of the game.

1792
02:16:46,409 --> 02:16:46,969
I'm realizing.

1793
02:16:46,969 --> 02:16:49,690
This is just like hard mode secondary shit.

1794
02:16:49,690 --> 02:16:51,370
I need to do the actual mission.

1795
02:16:54,379 --> 02:16:55,260
What the fuck?

1796
02:16:58,069 --> 02:16:59,190
I can't even do this!

1797
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:06,040
Get out of my face.

1798
02:17:06,040 --> 02:17:18,620
You fuckin' tin can?

1799
02:17:18,620 --> 02:17:19,860
High disadvantage, what?

1800
02:17:19,860 --> 02:17:21,780
Wait, open that back up.

1801
02:17:21,780 --> 02:17:26,420
Open that back up.

1802
02:17:26,420 --> 02:17:31,149
Go, go, go, get it, get it.

1803
02:17:31,149 --> 02:17:33,389
Who needs advanced hacking when you have

1804
02:17:33,389 --> 02:17:40,840
idiots that open doors for free?

1805
02:17:40,840 --> 02:17:56,170
God damn it.

1806
02:17:56,170 --> 02:18:00,260
I'm good.

1807
02:18:00,260 --> 02:18:03,629
Like that, where are they?

1808
02:18:03,629 --> 02:18:06,780
You can do your corporate espionage from there.

1809
02:18:06,780 --> 02:18:15,379
Oh my god, there's a person here.

1810
02:18:15,379 --> 02:18:26,750
Shoot him, what?

1811
02:18:26,750 --> 02:18:32,030
What's that, what's that, what's it on me?

1812
02:18:32,030 --> 02:18:33,030
Hey, what's that on your phone?

1813
02:18:33,030 --> 02:18:43,700
Somebody just sent you a funny meme on the internet.

1814
02:18:43,700 --> 02:18:53,350
Okay, get out of here.

1815
02:18:53,350 --> 02:18:57,930
Hack it, hack this, hack this thing.

1816
02:18:57,930 --> 02:18:59,530
Hack it, is it just me, is it just me?

1817
02:18:59,530 --> 02:19:00,729
Fuck, what?

1818
02:19:00,729 --> 02:19:14,559
Download, all right, downloading it, 5%.

1819
02:19:14,559 --> 02:19:26,540
Oh, look at that view count, skyrocketing.

1820
02:19:26,540 --> 02:19:27,780
What's wrong with this?

1821
02:19:27,780 --> 02:19:30,420
Oh, this thing is sad, this is sad.

1822
02:19:33,590 --> 02:19:35,270
I had to put it out of its misery.

1823
02:19:35,270 --> 02:19:46,659
It was flying around.

1824
02:19:46,659 --> 02:19:50,940
I did it, okay.

1825
02:19:50,940 --> 02:20:05,430
Uh-oh, I don't think, I can't leave.

1826
02:20:05,430 --> 02:20:13,510
Wait, wait, wait, I'm good, I got it.

1827
02:20:13,510 --> 02:20:34,299
Thank god I can do it from inside.

1828
02:20:34,340 --> 02:20:36,379
Oh, we're out.

1829
02:20:36,379 --> 02:20:37,540
See, this game's not bad.

1830
02:20:37,540 --> 02:20:39,739
Look at this, this is a fun, cool thing I just did.

1831
02:20:39,739 --> 02:20:48,440
What do we have?

1832
02:20:48,440 --> 02:20:53,670
It could maybe replace a few million humans at most.

1833
02:20:53,670 --> 02:20:55,969
I suppose from your perspective, that's a lot.

1834
02:20:55,969 --> 02:20:57,250
If you like, we can go destroy it

1835
02:20:57,250 --> 02:20:59,649
before it puts anyone else out of work.

1836
02:20:59,649 --> 02:21:02,290
Very good, forward me the coordinates.

1837
02:21:02,290 --> 02:21:05,479
All right, I got it, we're good.

1838
02:21:05,479 --> 02:21:07,819
Now, okay, now I'm gonna do a mission.

1839
02:21:07,819 --> 02:21:09,000
Let's go do a real mission,

1840
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,799
not one of these fake missions, a real one.

1841
02:21:11,799 --> 02:21:21,379
Here we go, recruit Seth Den, that's not a real mission.

1842
02:21:21,379 --> 02:21:25,819
Here it is, track this, please.

1843
02:21:25,819 --> 02:21:26,659
What are my skill points?

1844
02:21:26,659 --> 02:21:29,479
Hell yeah, let's go.

1845
02:21:29,479 --> 02:21:31,819
Here's my team.

1846
02:21:31,819 --> 02:21:33,979
What does he got?

1847
02:21:33,979 --> 02:21:39,780
New operative, I can, oh, I can switch to this operative.

1848
02:21:39,780 --> 02:21:49,850
This guy dead?

1849
02:21:49,850 --> 02:21:56,250
All right, I'm good for now.

1850
02:21:56,250 --> 02:22:21,860
You beat his ass and now he wants to be on the team.

1851
02:22:21,860 --> 02:22:29,059
What is this, hold on, there's tech points in here.

1852
02:22:29,059 --> 02:22:35,569
Let's see, oh, wait, recruitment.

1853
02:22:35,569 --> 02:22:49,590
No, no, no, no more recruitments.

1854
02:22:49,590 --> 02:22:52,590
Can I get on stage?

1855
02:22:52,590 --> 02:23:10,840
Oh, free money, this, this.

1856
02:23:10,840 --> 02:23:15,389
Oops, okay, what am I doing?

1857
02:23:15,389 --> 02:23:16,510
Okay, mission.

1858
02:23:16,510 --> 02:23:23,729
Sir, I'm gonna need you to pull over that car, please.

1859
02:23:23,729 --> 02:23:31,590
Somebody, what?

1860
02:23:31,590 --> 02:23:33,989
This thing zips, holy shit, look at this thing.

1861
02:23:41,139 --> 02:23:44,590
All right, raise it.

1862
02:23:44,590 --> 02:23:58,000
What do you mean checkpoint?

1863
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,260
All right, I'll be on operations data.

1864
02:24:00,260 --> 02:24:02,459
I'll be in propaganda, let's do mission one.

1865
02:24:16,590 --> 02:24:28,760
Now this is pod racing.

1866
02:24:28,760 --> 02:24:32,629
In here, all right, get me out of this.

1867
02:24:32,629 --> 02:24:35,659
Sneak into this place.

1868
02:24:35,659 --> 02:24:37,680
You just taking a picture of me?

1869
02:24:37,680 --> 02:24:40,370
Taking photos of me?

1870
02:24:40,370 --> 02:24:42,690
All right, this is restricted.

1871
02:24:42,690 --> 02:24:46,479
Get operations data and get the propaganda.

1872
02:24:46,479 --> 02:24:48,860
Restricted areas are dangerous.

1873
02:24:48,860 --> 02:24:51,889
Press V to scan the area to reveal scouting opportunities.

1874
02:24:51,889 --> 02:24:55,579
I'm glad I got this tutorial now.

1875
02:24:55,579 --> 02:24:56,979
Captains will call for reinforcements

1876
02:24:56,979 --> 02:25:01,610
if they detect you, eliminate them before they do.

1877
02:25:01,610 --> 02:25:03,649
Ammos, drones, traps, got it.

1878
02:25:03,649 --> 02:25:05,770
Albion have established an operational base

1879
02:25:05,770 --> 02:25:07,250
in the Royal Court of Justice.

1880
02:25:07,250 --> 02:25:08,090
Up there.

1881
02:25:08,090 --> 02:25:09,729
First they take over the justice system,

1882
02:25:09,729 --> 02:25:10,629
then they move in.

1883
02:25:10,629 --> 02:25:12,489
So much for rule of law.

1884
02:25:12,489 --> 02:25:13,930
Exactly.

1885
02:25:13,930 --> 02:25:14,770
Should I download some?

1886
02:25:14,770 --> 02:25:16,450
There's information here about how Albion

1887
02:25:16,450 --> 02:25:19,450
are targeting dissenters, the who and the why.

1888
02:25:19,450 --> 02:25:20,969
I love this PS2 game.

1889
02:25:20,969 --> 02:25:23,969
Me too, it's very fun.

1890
02:25:24,770 --> 02:25:25,610
All right, what is that?

1891
02:25:25,610 --> 02:25:29,000
Is that a GTX 3090?

1892
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:33,940
Is somebody talking to me?

1893
02:25:33,940 --> 02:25:34,860
All right, I definitely have to do that.

1894
02:25:34,860 --> 02:25:39,459
Let's go up there.

1895
02:25:39,459 --> 02:25:42,010
Can I do anything with this?

1896
02:25:42,010 --> 02:25:43,010
Can't download that from here.

1897
02:25:43,010 --> 02:25:47,909
I can't fuck with this from here.

1898
02:25:47,909 --> 02:25:49,770
Oh, I can do that.

1899
02:25:49,770 --> 02:25:59,829
Hi Jack, this is a mouse trap?

1900
02:25:59,829 --> 02:26:01,600
What else you got?

1901
02:26:01,600 --> 02:26:03,319
Got him.

1902
02:26:03,319 --> 02:26:04,139
Only one guy left.

1903
02:26:04,139 --> 02:26:12,709
Anybody else in here?

1904
02:26:12,709 --> 02:26:14,200
This guy.

1905
02:26:14,200 --> 02:26:17,969
Got him.

1906
02:26:17,969 --> 02:26:18,790
Okay.

1907
02:26:18,790 --> 02:26:19,930
I think we're clear.

1908
02:26:19,930 --> 02:26:22,459
I can go in now, right?

1909
02:26:22,459 --> 02:26:23,299
I don't see anybody else.

1910
02:26:23,299 --> 02:26:24,299
All right, there's a guy here.

1911
02:26:24,299 --> 02:26:25,139
All right, wait, hold on.

1912
02:26:25,139 --> 02:26:37,690
Distract you, go in.

1913
02:26:37,690 --> 02:26:40,049
There ain't nobody else, right?

1914
02:26:40,809 --> 02:26:41,649
All right, there's the power source.

1915
02:26:41,649 --> 02:26:45,229
We're gonna turn the power on.

1916
02:26:45,229 --> 02:26:52,760
Everybody's dead, I'm fine.

1917
02:26:52,760 --> 02:26:54,799
Play Batman Arkham Asylum.

1918
02:26:54,799 --> 02:26:56,840
I beat that game on the hardest difficulty five times

1919
02:26:56,840 --> 02:26:57,979
and I was like 20.

1920
02:26:57,979 --> 02:27:00,909
No.

1921
02:27:00,909 --> 02:27:16,510
And if you believe that, then you're a sucker.

1922
02:27:16,510 --> 02:27:18,780
Shit!

1923
02:27:18,780 --> 02:27:21,590
You take two headshots?

1924
02:27:21,590 --> 02:27:22,430
Nobody, right?

1925
02:27:22,430 --> 02:27:25,620
Wait, I got it, it's fine.

1926
02:27:25,620 --> 02:27:33,190
Get that data.

1927
02:27:33,190 --> 02:27:39,299
Put your head up.

1928
02:27:39,299 --> 02:27:44,280
See, first mission done, I got it.

1929
02:27:44,280 --> 02:27:48,280
That was a challenge?

1930
02:27:48,280 --> 02:27:51,799
What, that was a challenge mode?

1931
02:27:51,799 --> 02:27:53,729
No, I wanted to do the mission.

1932
02:27:53,729 --> 02:27:55,209
Bagley, what do we have?

1933
02:27:55,209 --> 02:27:57,969
A list of what Aldian consider high value targets

1934
02:27:57,969 --> 02:28:00,809
that are threats to the peaceful running of London.

1935
02:28:00,809 --> 02:28:01,649
See here?

1936
02:28:01,649 --> 02:28:02,469
A journalist.

1937
02:28:02,469 --> 02:28:04,610
And this one runs a community shelter.

1938
02:28:04,610 --> 02:28:05,450
Good God.

1939
02:28:05,450 --> 02:28:09,000
What are we gonna do?

1940
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:10,280
Okay.

1941
02:28:10,280 --> 02:28:11,719
This is across the whole city.

1942
02:28:20,659 --> 02:28:21,979
This is still the tutorial.

1943
02:28:22,180 --> 02:28:23,020
Oh.

1944
02:28:29,260 --> 02:28:30,180
Gadgets are useful.

1945
02:28:30,180 --> 02:28:32,670
I'm sure they are.

1946
02:28:35,709 --> 02:28:36,549
Gamers.

1947
02:28:40,639 --> 02:28:42,440
Oh, this is one of those games that runs good

1948
02:28:42,440 --> 02:28:44,120
when it becomes dusk.

1949
02:28:44,120 --> 02:28:45,040
It's one of those games.

1950
02:28:45,040 --> 02:28:47,459
Cool.

1951
02:28:47,459 --> 02:29:03,120
Press four.

1952
02:29:03,120 --> 02:29:05,680
There's essays in chat?

1953
02:29:05,680 --> 02:29:06,520
What are they saying?

1954
02:29:06,520 --> 02:29:07,559
Are they talking about me?

1955
02:29:07,559 --> 02:29:11,139
Are they making fun of me?

1956
02:29:11,139 --> 02:29:12,379
It really is GTA four.

1957
02:29:12,379 --> 02:29:17,159
This is not good.

1958
02:29:17,159 --> 02:29:24,129
It's actually like kind of worse than GTA four.

1959
02:29:24,129 --> 02:29:26,250
I need a new computer so bad.

1960
02:29:26,250 --> 02:29:27,649
It's not even funny anymore.

1961
02:29:27,649 --> 02:29:30,440
Like it was funny like two weeks ago.

1962
02:29:30,440 --> 02:29:41,719
Now it's like, get a new computer.

1963
02:29:41,719 --> 02:29:42,959
Saints Row three.

1964
02:29:42,959 --> 02:29:49,969
You know, I was gonna play Saints Row two like last week.

1965
02:29:49,969 --> 02:29:56,159
This runs bad on a 3090.

1966
02:29:56,159 --> 02:29:57,840
Why do I feel like that's the norm?

1967
02:30:01,639 --> 02:30:02,920
I've lost control of the car.

1968
02:30:02,920 --> 02:30:18,680
Okay.

1969
02:30:18,680 --> 02:30:19,760
All right.

1970
02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:25,270
In here, we have to disrupt the propaganda.

1971
02:30:25,270 --> 02:30:26,250
This is not restricted.

1972
02:30:26,250 --> 02:30:28,370
This is ATM.

1973
02:30:29,209 --> 02:30:30,049
Oh shit.

1974
02:30:30,049 --> 02:30:33,340
I just ATM money.

1975
02:30:33,340 --> 02:30:46,469
I'm not supposed to take it all.

1976
02:30:46,469 --> 02:30:54,590
Can I go in here?

1977
02:30:54,590 --> 02:30:57,920
I don't fuck with a gamer.

1978
02:30:57,920 --> 02:31:00,719
That's what I said.

1979
02:31:00,719 --> 02:31:04,479
Those Albian pricks putting their ugly stamp on everything.

1980
02:31:04,479 --> 02:31:06,280
It makes me sick just looking at it.

1981
02:31:06,280 --> 02:31:07,120
You're in good hands.

1982
02:31:07,120 --> 02:31:09,079
It looks to be that much less once you're done here.

1983
02:31:09,079 --> 02:31:12,000
Let's give Camden a break from these eyesores.

1984
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:13,079
On it.

1985
02:31:13,079 --> 02:31:16,440
All right, so I've changed the...

1986
02:31:16,440 --> 02:31:17,479
So we're gonna hack the thing

1987
02:31:17,479 --> 02:31:26,479
to make it look like it's ugly or something?

1988
02:31:26,479 --> 02:31:27,920
Propaganda.

1989
02:31:27,920 --> 02:31:29,239
Propaganda.

1990
02:31:29,319 --> 02:31:31,739
We have to disrupt the propaganda.

1991
02:31:31,739 --> 02:31:32,979
I didn't even hit you.

1992
02:31:32,979 --> 02:31:34,219
I didn't hit you, you're fine.

1993
02:31:34,219 --> 02:31:35,700
I didn't even hit you.

1994
02:31:35,700 --> 02:31:37,579
You did not get hit by that bike.

1995
02:31:37,579 --> 02:31:42,250
By the way, how do you feel about the government?

1996
02:31:42,250 --> 02:31:43,399
Get up.

1997
02:31:43,399 --> 02:31:46,520
I need to recruit you.

1998
02:31:46,520 --> 02:31:57,200
Nevermind.

1999
02:31:57,200 --> 02:31:58,040
This is it.

2000
02:31:58,040 --> 02:31:59,440
If you hijack that scissor lift,

2001
02:31:59,440 --> 02:32:01,159
you could use it to access the rooftop.

2002
02:32:01,159 --> 02:32:09,319
Okay, hijack.

2003
02:32:09,319 --> 02:32:17,809
Wait, don't I need to be in it first?

2004
02:32:17,809 --> 02:32:20,079
Get in it first.

2005
02:32:20,079 --> 02:32:21,559
Okay, let's go.

2006
02:32:21,559 --> 02:32:28,959
Hijack.

2007
02:32:28,959 --> 02:32:37,120
And how excited are you guys for Watch Dogs 3?

2008
02:32:37,159 --> 02:32:39,319
Wait, I'm not gonna be able to get back in this.

2009
02:32:39,319 --> 02:32:48,819
Who cares?

2010
02:32:48,819 --> 02:32:51,950
Ooh, tech.

2011
02:32:51,950 --> 02:32:52,790
He hates it.

2012
02:32:52,790 --> 02:32:55,440
No, I don't.

2013
02:32:55,440 --> 02:33:02,680
I don't hate it.

2014
02:33:02,680 --> 02:33:03,520
Furu.

2015
02:33:03,520 --> 02:33:05,159
No, don't say Furu.

2016
02:33:05,159 --> 02:33:11,069
Don't say Furu, they're watching.

2017
02:33:11,069 --> 02:33:17,819
What's that puke?

2018
02:33:17,819 --> 02:33:21,510
Can I go inside of this?

2019
02:33:21,510 --> 02:33:23,989
No, sorry, Nancy, you can't do that.

2020
02:33:23,989 --> 02:33:37,440
Nobody can do that.

2021
02:33:37,440 --> 02:33:39,750
All right, turn it off.

2022
02:33:39,750 --> 02:33:41,350
Congratulations, you've done the first mission

2023
02:33:41,350 --> 02:33:47,239
of Watch Dogs.

2024
02:33:47,239 --> 02:33:54,399
We shall never surrender.

2025
02:33:54,399 --> 02:34:00,340
Hey, it was me.

2026
02:34:00,340 --> 02:34:01,159
All right, I did it.

2027
02:34:01,159 --> 02:34:05,059
So now what?

2028
02:34:05,739 --> 02:34:06,819
I'll get people's attention.

2029
02:34:06,819 --> 02:34:09,540
Let them know someone is standing up to Albion.

2030
02:34:09,540 --> 02:34:12,420
Light the spark that they can stand up to.

2031
02:34:12,420 --> 02:34:15,620
If nothing else, it'll relieve their eye strain.

2032
02:34:15,620 --> 02:34:16,459
Where's my car?

2033
02:34:16,459 --> 02:34:18,690
There it is.

2034
02:34:18,690 --> 02:34:19,510
Mission started.

2035
02:34:19,510 --> 02:34:20,569
Clarion call.

2036
02:34:23,840 --> 02:34:25,959
We're already seeing results from what you've done.

2037
02:34:25,959 --> 02:34:27,040
That list we found.

2038
02:34:27,040 --> 02:34:27,879
Taxi.

2039
02:34:27,879 --> 02:34:30,559
News journalist in Camden who's been investigating Albion.

2040
02:34:30,559 --> 02:34:33,040
We reached out and he's got information that can help us.

2041
02:34:33,040 --> 02:34:34,079
Why is it drive?

2042
02:34:35,440 --> 02:34:36,280
Forward me the call.

2043
02:34:36,280 --> 02:34:38,260
What's wrong with this thing?

2044
02:34:38,260 --> 02:34:44,860
It's running over a box?

2045
02:34:44,860 --> 02:34:48,799
Oh, come on.

2046
02:34:48,799 --> 02:34:52,120
All right, goodbye, it was fun.

2047
02:34:52,120 --> 02:35:00,790
Meet with the dead second foreman.

2048
02:35:00,790 --> 02:35:02,649
I can do that.

2049
02:35:02,649 --> 02:35:03,489
What the shit now?

2050
02:35:03,489 --> 02:35:13,340
Why is this up?

2051
02:35:13,340 --> 02:35:16,110
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

2052
02:35:16,110 --> 02:35:17,430
Yo, that car looks sick.

2053
02:35:17,430 --> 02:35:20,709
Yeah, it does.

2054
02:35:20,709 --> 02:35:22,190
This does kind of look like Batman, doesn't it?

2055
02:35:22,190 --> 02:35:30,069
Yeah, now that you say that, I can see it.

2056
02:35:30,069 --> 02:35:41,229
Okay, meet with the informant.

2057
02:35:41,229 --> 02:35:42,549
Don't run him over, don't run him over,

2058
02:35:42,549 --> 02:35:44,950
don't run him over, don't run him over.

2059
02:35:44,950 --> 02:35:46,459
Who's this guy?

2060
02:35:46,459 --> 02:35:49,270
Neil Brown stole Albion weapon schematics.

2061
02:35:49,270 --> 02:35:50,510
He knows how to summon drones

2062
02:35:50,510 --> 02:35:55,850
and he's got extra faction damage.

2063
02:35:55,850 --> 02:36:02,690
All right, he's a summoner?

2064
02:36:02,690 --> 02:36:06,090
A little birdie told me you needed help.

2065
02:36:06,090 --> 02:36:07,530
Even more money came in.

2066
02:36:07,530 --> 02:36:08,850
You can't believe someone else is.

2067
02:36:08,850 --> 02:36:09,690
Thought I was alive, right?

2068
02:36:09,690 --> 02:36:10,530
Holy shit, guys.

2069
02:36:10,530 --> 02:36:12,610
You're not doing much, just putting the word out, are you?

2070
02:36:12,610 --> 02:36:14,209
Devil X gave $50.

2071
02:36:14,209 --> 02:36:15,659
Someone has to, don't they?

2072
02:36:15,659 --> 02:36:18,100
I have Insomnia gave $50, back to back.

2073
02:36:18,100 --> 02:36:19,579
Almost got Clip finding this.

2074
02:36:19,579 --> 02:36:21,459
All of Albion's operational data for the entire system.

2075
02:36:21,459 --> 02:36:23,979
Actually good computer fund, and here's some money,

2076
02:36:23,979 --> 02:36:25,540
seed money for a better laptop

2077
02:36:25,540 --> 02:36:27,579
because you're playing on one, clearly.

2078
02:36:27,620 --> 02:36:29,459
You'll get no argument from me.

2079
02:36:29,459 --> 02:36:30,700
Here's a sample.

2080
02:36:30,700 --> 02:36:33,260
Albion's closed King's Cross for the public, right?

2081
02:36:33,260 --> 02:36:34,379
What people don't know is that-

2082
02:36:34,379 --> 02:36:35,219
It's gonna happen.

2083
02:36:35,219 --> 02:36:37,420
It's their logistic center, materials.

2084
02:36:37,420 --> 02:36:38,819
Dude, when I build this new computer.

2085
02:36:38,819 --> 02:36:40,500
A lot of it runs through there.

2086
02:36:40,500 --> 02:36:43,020
We're gonna do a super benchmark stream.

2087
02:36:43,020 --> 02:36:44,180
Put it out of commission

2088
02:36:44,180 --> 02:36:46,500
and you'll severely hamstring Albion's operations

2089
02:36:46,500 --> 02:36:47,340
here in Camden.

2090
02:36:47,340 --> 02:36:48,739
Hell, everywhere.

2091
02:36:48,739 --> 02:36:53,889
Then that's our move.

2092
02:36:53,889 --> 02:36:58,069
I'm gonna run this thing through the absolute, through hell.

2093
02:36:58,069 --> 02:37:12,170
Okay, no, don't kill him.

2094
02:37:13,090 --> 02:37:15,250
I've just seen a car drive out.

2095
02:37:15,250 --> 02:37:19,729
Like somebody finally got the car in the mall out.

2096
02:37:19,729 --> 02:37:28,239
Oh my God, he got the car out of the mall.

2097
02:37:28,239 --> 02:37:29,879
You bastard, I can't believe somebody

2098
02:37:29,879 --> 02:37:38,030
actually was able to do that.

2099
02:37:38,030 --> 02:37:40,309
And then one of the representatives from the mall is like,

2100
02:37:40,309 --> 02:37:43,149
well, I mean, this kind of was the point.

2101
02:37:43,149 --> 02:37:44,229
We left the keys in there.

2102
02:37:44,229 --> 02:37:48,180
We were just waiting for somebody to drive out of the,

2103
02:37:48,180 --> 02:37:52,620
out of the JCPenney.

2104
02:37:52,620 --> 02:37:59,389
It's just a free car.

2105
02:37:59,389 --> 02:38:02,090
I just went in a circle.

2106
02:38:02,090 --> 02:38:03,770
Holy shit.

2107
02:38:03,770 --> 02:38:04,610
What did I just run over?

2108
02:38:04,610 --> 02:38:05,450
What did I just run over?

2109
02:38:05,450 --> 02:38:06,809
What did I just run over?

2110
02:38:06,809 --> 02:38:07,649
What'd I hit?

2111
02:38:14,899 --> 02:38:16,899
That was a camp.

2112
02:38:16,899 --> 02:38:17,899
Jesus Christ.

2113
02:38:25,649 --> 02:38:26,489
Jesus.

2114
02:38:35,459 --> 02:38:37,700
Okay, we can get a drone.

2115
02:38:37,700 --> 02:38:43,000
Hijack a news drone.

2116
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:44,780
Okay.

2117
02:38:44,780 --> 02:38:45,620
Hijack.

2118
02:38:47,819 --> 02:38:49,459
Up, down, flash.

2119
02:38:51,340 --> 02:38:52,860
Find the information generator.

2120
02:38:57,469 --> 02:38:59,549
I'll go spotlight, turn that off.

2121
02:38:59,549 --> 02:39:00,389
Oh, hey.

2122
02:39:00,389 --> 02:39:02,190
Oh shit, drone fight.

2123
02:39:02,190 --> 02:39:07,739
Drone fight.

2124
02:39:07,739 --> 02:39:15,149
Okay, out of here.

2125
02:39:15,149 --> 02:39:16,389
Photograph the generator.

2126
02:39:16,389 --> 02:39:25,590
What happened?

2127
02:39:25,590 --> 02:39:30,870
Just use cover.

2128
02:39:30,870 --> 02:39:31,870
All right, there's the schematics.

2129
02:39:31,870 --> 02:39:34,010
Photograph it.

2130
02:39:34,010 --> 02:39:38,219
How many do I need?

2131
02:39:38,219 --> 02:39:39,420
F.

2132
02:39:43,299 --> 02:39:53,329
Okay, download the detonation code.

2133
02:39:53,329 --> 02:39:54,170
Fuck.

2134
02:39:54,329 --> 02:40:03,149
Okay, just wave.

2135
02:40:03,149 --> 02:40:09,969
Fuck, wave.

2136
02:40:09,969 --> 02:40:12,260
Got it.

2137
02:40:12,260 --> 02:40:23,659
Hack, hack, hack, hack, hack, hack, hack, hack.

2138
02:40:23,659 --> 02:40:28,260
47%, 50%, 55%, 60%.

2139
02:40:28,260 --> 02:40:37,620
We almost loaded the game.

2140
02:40:37,620 --> 02:40:38,459
Hack faster.

2141
02:40:38,459 --> 02:40:39,540
I'm going as fast as I can.

2142
02:40:39,540 --> 02:40:40,379
That's it.

2143
02:40:40,379 --> 02:40:41,579
Use the code on the generator

2144
02:40:41,579 --> 02:40:43,379
and I can trigger a power surge.

2145
02:40:43,379 --> 02:40:44,540
All right, go back to the generator.

2146
02:40:44,540 --> 02:40:51,250
Stack King's cross offline and the rail system too.

2147
02:40:51,250 --> 02:40:53,729
Is this exhilarating?

2148
02:40:53,729 --> 02:40:54,969
Is it?

2149
02:40:54,969 --> 02:41:04,569
Wait, should I go flash this guy in the face?

2150
02:41:04,569 --> 02:41:07,819
Did I leave?

2151
02:41:07,819 --> 02:41:17,700
Oh shit, it exploded.

2152
02:41:17,700 --> 02:41:30,370
That was you, oh.

2153
02:41:30,370 --> 02:41:33,370
We got a gold mine of information out of St. Pancras.

2154
02:41:33,370 --> 02:41:36,930
Albion convoys, informants, gear, you name it.

2155
02:41:36,930 --> 02:41:39,450
Everything we need to ignite the people of London,

2156
02:41:39,450 --> 02:41:41,209
like we did in Camden.

2157
02:41:41,209 --> 02:41:42,729
Derail Albion's operations

2158
02:41:42,729 --> 02:41:46,690
and give the people a reason to rise up borough by borough.

2159
02:41:46,690 --> 02:41:48,290
The more we do that,

2160
02:41:48,290 --> 02:41:50,409
the more we'll get allies flocking to the courts.

2161
02:41:50,409 --> 02:41:51,290
City of London.

2162
02:41:51,290 --> 02:41:54,209
We'll show London that DedSec is here for them.

2163
02:41:54,209 --> 02:41:56,329
London was mine?

2164
02:41:56,329 --> 02:42:01,299
What do you mean?

2165
02:42:01,299 --> 02:42:03,020
That was off the chain, mate.

2166
02:42:03,020 --> 02:42:06,079
I knew DedSec weren't the bad guys Albion was saying.

2167
02:42:06,079 --> 02:42:07,959
London was fine.

2168
02:42:07,959 --> 02:42:08,799
Thanks.

2169
02:42:08,799 --> 02:42:09,639
Thanks.

2170
02:42:09,639 --> 02:42:10,479
Now that you've shown the borough

2171
02:42:10,479 --> 02:42:12,559
what DedSec is really all about,

2172
02:42:12,559 --> 02:42:14,120
there are gonna be folks wanting to join up.

2173
02:42:14,120 --> 02:42:16,760
A lot of people have been looking for a way to fight back.

2174
02:42:16,760 --> 02:42:19,520
Let me have the title of my stream make sense, finally.

2175
02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:21,180
I'll contact you very soon.

2176
02:42:21,180 --> 02:42:22,780
I happen to know they're champion at the bit.

2177
02:42:22,780 --> 02:42:25,329
At this point, I think we'll take all cover.

2178
02:42:25,329 --> 02:42:33,459
DedSec needs people.

2179
02:42:33,459 --> 02:42:37,840
Spray, what, what is this, around my hair?

2180
02:42:37,840 --> 02:42:39,479
DedSec support complete borough activities

2181
02:42:39,479 --> 02:42:41,399
to increase DedSec support.

2182
02:42:41,399 --> 02:42:42,680
You get tech points.

2183
02:42:42,680 --> 02:42:43,879
Skilled recruits have abilities

2184
02:42:43,879 --> 02:42:46,850
or weapons that are valuable to DedSec.

2185
02:42:46,850 --> 02:42:48,129
When a borough becomes defiant,

2186
02:42:48,129 --> 02:42:50,569
a skilled recruit will be added to the team.

2187
02:42:50,569 --> 02:42:51,409
You got it.

2188
02:42:51,409 --> 02:42:52,290
All right, let's go find an old lady

2189
02:42:52,290 --> 02:42:59,579
and ask her if she wants to join.

2190
02:42:59,579 --> 02:43:00,420
Wait, what?

2191
02:43:00,420 --> 02:43:05,700
Who did I recruit?

2192
02:43:05,700 --> 02:43:07,059
Game doesn't normally look this bad.

2193
02:43:07,059 --> 02:43:08,219
Well, it only, it does when you put it

2194
02:43:08,219 --> 02:43:10,399
on the lowest settings

2195
02:43:10,399 --> 02:43:11,799
because it's the only way you can play it.

2196
02:43:11,799 --> 02:43:13,360
There's a lot of potential in you.

2197
02:43:13,360 --> 02:43:15,500
I trust you won't disappoint.

2198
02:43:15,500 --> 02:43:18,420
I must say, I'm rather looking forward to the experience.

2199
02:43:18,420 --> 02:43:20,579
Let's go hunt some baddies.

2200
02:43:21,500 --> 02:43:33,020
Recruit a kid.

2201
02:43:33,020 --> 02:43:34,100
Me, you're still alive.

2202
02:43:34,100 --> 02:43:35,299
I also have been a tenner.

2203
02:43:35,299 --> 02:43:36,139
Not only that.

2204
02:43:36,139 --> 02:43:37,780
Every time we switch,

2205
02:43:37,780 --> 02:43:39,340
the last person has to die.

2206
02:43:39,340 --> 02:43:41,319
So now I spy with a vertical eye.

2207
02:43:41,319 --> 02:43:44,739
We're just jumping hosts.

2208
02:43:44,739 --> 02:43:45,739
What is it?

2209
02:43:45,739 --> 02:43:48,940
The Signals Intelligence Response Service or SIRS

2210
02:43:48,940 --> 02:43:50,659
or the Earl Grey Gestapo

2211
02:43:50,659 --> 02:43:52,139
have developed a surveillance technology

2212
02:43:52,139 --> 02:43:54,020
called AR reconstruction.

2213
02:43:54,020 --> 02:43:56,700
It's the leading edge of privacy rights violation

2214
02:43:56,700 --> 02:43:57,979
and thus it could be very useful

2215
02:43:57,979 --> 02:43:59,739
in our attempts to find Zero Day.

2216
02:44:00,579 --> 02:44:03,780
It's just a symbiont.

2217
02:44:03,780 --> 02:44:07,899
I don't like this human sheath anymore.

2218
02:44:07,899 --> 02:44:09,299
All right, we need to find an old lady.

2219
02:44:09,299 --> 02:44:10,579
Old lady.

2220
02:44:10,579 --> 02:44:11,420
Nope.

2221
02:44:11,420 --> 02:44:12,420
Whoa.

2222
02:44:12,420 --> 02:44:13,700
It just barely touched.

2223
02:44:13,700 --> 02:44:17,059
Yeah.

2224
02:44:17,059 --> 02:44:20,979
You're all right, we're fine.

2225
02:44:20,979 --> 02:44:30,860
Old lady, old lady, old lady.

2226
02:44:30,860 --> 02:44:32,149
Old lady.

2227
02:44:32,149 --> 02:44:33,489
Nope.

2228
02:44:33,489 --> 02:44:34,309
Old lady.

2229
02:44:34,309 --> 02:44:43,579
Nope.

2230
02:44:43,579 --> 02:44:50,569
We'll find the queen.

2231
02:44:50,569 --> 02:44:51,409
Or whatever.

2232
02:44:51,409 --> 02:45:02,899
We're a new operative now.

2233
02:45:02,899 --> 02:45:08,399
I'm just keeping my eye out for old ladies.

2234
02:45:08,399 --> 02:45:09,639
Just auto drive and look around.

2235
02:45:09,639 --> 02:45:14,350
Auto drive now enabled.

2236
02:45:14,350 --> 02:45:20,549
All right.

2237
02:45:21,350 --> 02:45:22,430
Nope, don't see any.

2238
02:45:22,430 --> 02:45:25,879
Nope.

2239
02:45:25,879 --> 02:45:28,250
Looking for old ladies.

2240
02:45:28,250 --> 02:45:34,579
The older the better.

2241
02:45:34,579 --> 02:45:40,729
Old.

2242
02:45:40,729 --> 02:45:42,049
Oh, I saw the gameplay trailer.

2243
02:45:42,049 --> 02:45:47,149
I want to do it.

2244
02:45:47,149 --> 02:45:58,250
I want to see the gameplay trailer.

2245
02:45:58,250 --> 02:46:13,299
There's no old people in London?

2246
02:46:13,299 --> 02:46:14,219
It's a rare spawn.

2247
02:46:14,219 --> 02:46:17,729
An old lady's a rare spawn?

2248
02:46:17,729 --> 02:46:25,399
No.

2249
02:46:25,399 --> 02:46:26,879
Auto drive now disabled.

2250
02:46:26,879 --> 02:46:27,719
Nope.

2251
02:46:27,719 --> 02:46:30,780
I thought that was an old man.

2252
02:46:30,780 --> 02:46:39,959
Keep your eyes open.

2253
02:46:39,959 --> 02:46:41,530
Hello?

2254
02:46:41,530 --> 02:46:43,159
Excuse me.

2255
02:46:43,159 --> 02:46:46,450
I have a proposition for you.

2256
02:46:46,450 --> 02:46:50,139
I'm from...

2257
02:46:50,139 --> 02:46:51,739
Nah, I thought you were old.

2258
02:46:51,739 --> 02:46:52,579
Nevermind.

2259
02:46:52,579 --> 02:47:02,829
I thought you were somebody else.

2260
02:47:02,829 --> 02:47:05,420
Not old enough.

2261
02:47:05,420 --> 02:47:06,260
Excuse me.

2262
02:47:06,260 --> 02:47:08,739
Jesus, come on, dude.

2263
02:47:08,739 --> 02:47:27,260
Get out of the way.

2264
02:47:27,260 --> 02:47:37,899
I'm slowly going over to the new mission too, by the way.

2265
02:47:37,899 --> 02:47:40,959
Old.

2266
02:47:40,959 --> 02:47:44,659
Instruction worker.

2267
02:47:44,659 --> 02:47:50,870
No, where are the old ladies?

2268
02:47:50,870 --> 02:47:51,909
All right.

2269
02:47:51,909 --> 02:47:52,750
I'm here.

2270
02:47:52,750 --> 02:47:54,750
In theory, the AR reconstruction

2271
02:47:54,750 --> 02:47:57,270
should allow me to use various sources of surveillance data

2272
02:47:57,270 --> 02:47:58,989
to rebuild past events.

2273
02:47:58,989 --> 02:47:59,829
Access a data...

2274
02:47:59,829 --> 02:48:00,670
AR tech.

2275
02:48:00,670 --> 02:48:01,870
...scrape all the metadata for...

2276
02:48:01,870 --> 02:48:05,360
Can I get in this way?

2277
02:48:05,360 --> 02:48:07,000
No, I gotta go the other way.

2278
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:15,219
Around the other side.

2279
02:48:15,219 --> 02:48:16,059
Casino.

2280
02:48:16,059 --> 02:48:20,760
Go to the casino.

2281
02:48:20,760 --> 02:48:33,399
Is there a casino in this game?

2282
02:48:33,399 --> 02:48:37,590
You old?

2283
02:48:37,590 --> 02:48:39,250
Excuse me, Emma.

2284
02:48:39,250 --> 02:48:47,139
I'd like to offer you a contract.

2285
02:48:47,139 --> 02:48:48,270
How are you?

2286
02:48:48,270 --> 02:48:49,870
How do you feel about the world right now?

2287
02:48:49,870 --> 02:48:53,299
Don't you feel like that you would want to become part of

2288
02:48:53,299 --> 02:48:57,989
something more?

2289
02:48:57,989 --> 02:49:01,329
Emma, I'd like to recruit you.

2290
02:49:01,329 --> 02:49:02,930
We have things to talk about.

2291
02:49:02,930 --> 02:49:04,969
Don't you think you want to be part of something more,

2292
02:49:04,969 --> 02:49:06,889
something bigger than yourself?

2293
02:49:06,889 --> 02:49:08,889
She's an activist who's been trying to gather intel

2294
02:49:08,889 --> 02:49:11,170
on Albion personnel movements through the city.

2295
02:49:11,170 --> 02:49:13,370
Looks like she wants to stay one step ahead of the goons.

2296
02:49:13,370 --> 02:49:14,370
Okay.

2297
02:49:14,370 --> 02:49:16,010
That is smart, yeah.

2298
02:49:16,010 --> 02:49:16,850
Let's help her.

2299
02:49:16,850 --> 02:49:18,290
Could turn into a nice little asset.

2300
02:49:18,290 --> 02:49:19,129
You're gonna...

2301
02:49:19,129 --> 02:49:19,969
A Ponzi scheme?

2302
02:49:19,969 --> 02:49:24,969
Look, you just have to sell 400 lipsticks and eye powders

2303
02:49:27,129 --> 02:49:29,530
every week and you'll make $40.

2304
02:49:29,530 --> 02:49:37,879
I'm telling you, it's the opportunity of a lifetime.

2305
02:49:37,879 --> 02:49:42,989
Okay, steal an Albion armored vehicle.

2306
02:49:42,989 --> 02:49:49,819
You got it.

2307
02:49:49,819 --> 02:49:51,340
Any armored vehicle, right?

2308
02:49:51,340 --> 02:50:01,569
Doesn't matter where.

2309
02:50:01,569 --> 02:50:04,739
You're blind, am I?

2310
02:50:11,239 --> 02:50:12,520
Fucking cartoon.

2311
02:50:12,520 --> 02:50:14,079
Tom and Jerry cartoon.

2312
02:50:14,079 --> 02:50:22,290
Can I play a game normally for once?

2313
02:50:22,290 --> 02:50:23,209
Oh, here's one.

2314
02:50:30,040 --> 02:50:31,079
Grandma, I got one.

2315
02:50:36,920 --> 02:50:37,760
I got it.

2316
02:50:42,340 --> 02:50:45,420
All of a sudden, a little tornado is gonna come pick me up

2317
02:50:45,420 --> 02:50:48,100
and I'm gonna get three tubes to pick to skip

2318
02:50:48,100 --> 02:51:04,899
a third of each portion of this game.

2319
02:51:04,899 --> 02:51:09,100
That's some deep reference right there.

2320
02:51:09,139 --> 02:51:12,260
And I feel bad for those who don't understand it.

2321
02:51:12,260 --> 02:51:22,600
That's a deep reference.

2322
02:51:22,600 --> 02:51:28,819
Wrong way.

2323
02:51:28,819 --> 02:51:31,860
It's not deep, it sucked.

2324
02:51:31,860 --> 02:51:36,639
But you just got yourself a timeout.

2325
02:51:36,639 --> 02:51:38,530
Next stream.

2326
02:51:38,530 --> 02:51:42,389
I'll remember your name.

2327
02:51:42,389 --> 02:51:44,709
Next stream, you're getting timed out.

2328
02:51:44,709 --> 02:51:45,549
You know what?

2329
02:51:45,549 --> 02:51:55,899
Who cares, run over.

2330
02:51:55,899 --> 02:51:56,739
I've got places to be.

2331
02:51:56,739 --> 02:52:01,899
I have an old lady to recruit.

2332
02:52:01,899 --> 02:52:18,670
Oh my goodness, thank God you weren't on that other bench.

2333
02:52:18,670 --> 02:52:28,819
Get Grandma, I'm getting her.

2334
02:52:28,819 --> 02:52:36,729
Distraction.

2335
02:52:36,729 --> 02:52:37,569
Yes, you have.

2336
02:52:37,569 --> 02:52:45,500
I'm safe.

2337
02:52:45,500 --> 02:53:00,270
This is so far away.

2338
02:53:00,309 --> 02:53:03,340
It's a very long drive.

2339
02:53:03,340 --> 02:53:06,360
I think that person's still under my car.

2340
02:53:06,360 --> 02:53:17,920
Are they?

2341
02:53:17,920 --> 02:53:26,129
NA driving in EU.

2342
02:53:26,129 --> 02:53:39,420
Is that gonna explode?

2343
02:53:39,420 --> 02:53:42,059
American streamer, he's on the wrong side of the road.

2344
02:53:42,059 --> 02:53:49,799
American streamer, yeah, that's me.

2345
02:53:49,799 --> 02:53:52,120
All right, it's time to play as old lady

2346
02:53:52,120 --> 02:53:53,159
for the rest of the game

2347
02:53:53,159 --> 02:53:58,379
and I don't even care if it's the worst.

2348
02:54:00,379 --> 02:54:01,219
Awesome.

2349
02:54:02,659 --> 02:54:07,850
Okay, here we go.

2350
02:54:07,850 --> 02:54:21,260
Hey, where are you?

2351
02:54:21,260 --> 02:54:22,100
Talk to Emma.

2352
02:54:30,420 --> 02:54:39,860
Emma, I've returned your car.

2353
02:54:39,860 --> 02:54:49,149
It's just, yes, finally.

2354
02:54:53,549 --> 02:54:55,549
Excellent, didn't they talk like this?

2355
02:54:55,549 --> 02:54:57,750
Aiming often leaves something to be desired

2356
02:54:57,750 --> 02:54:59,309
but the hard drive in that vehicle

2357
02:54:59,309 --> 02:55:01,790
should more than suit your purposes.

2358
02:55:01,790 --> 02:55:03,350
You bet your ass.

2359
02:55:03,350 --> 02:55:06,270
Armed with this, I'll be able to dance circles

2360
02:55:06,270 --> 02:55:08,149
around those Albion thugs

2361
02:55:08,149 --> 02:55:11,030
and shove a boot up their backsides.

2362
02:55:11,030 --> 02:55:14,430
If you need anything at all, I'm at your service.

2363
02:55:14,430 --> 02:55:15,270
Hey, how about now?

2364
02:55:15,270 --> 02:55:18,110
DedSec could always use more people.

2365
02:55:18,110 --> 02:55:19,229
Interested?

2366
02:55:19,229 --> 02:55:24,090
Right, count me in.

2367
02:55:24,090 --> 02:55:27,450
iPad graphics, fucking come on.

2368
02:55:27,450 --> 02:55:30,149
All right, recruit complete. Recruit Emma Tan.

2369
02:55:31,309 --> 02:55:32,709
Here we go. Team.

2370
02:55:33,700 --> 02:55:34,500
There's Emma.

2371
02:55:34,899 --> 02:55:35,899
Swap to Emma.

2372
02:55:47,100 --> 02:55:48,200
Isn't Emma right here?

2373
02:55:55,239 --> 02:55:56,639
Welcome to DedSec, darling.

2374
02:55:56,940 --> 02:55:58,440
We are just thrilled to have you.

2375
02:55:59,299 --> 02:56:00,000
Brilliant.

2376
02:56:00,200 --> 02:56:02,399
I'm not ready to go to pasture yet.

2377
02:56:02,700 --> 02:56:03,899
Let's get to it.

2378
02:56:04,379 --> 02:56:04,979
Yeah.

2379
02:56:21,620 --> 02:56:23,219
How do I, uh, wait, wait, wait.

2380
02:56:26,399 --> 02:56:27,299
The new host.

2381
02:56:28,840 --> 02:56:30,840
She has a wrench. How do I use the wrench?

2382
02:56:33,700 --> 02:56:34,500
It's equipped. Okay.

2383
02:56:41,649 --> 02:56:42,450
New host.

2384
02:56:43,870 --> 02:56:46,270
Holy shit, she's so slow.

2385
02:56:49,049 --> 02:56:51,149
There's no way I'm going to be able to do this.

2386
02:56:52,860 --> 02:56:53,760
Slug.

2387
02:56:54,260 --> 02:56:55,659
And she can steal keys?

2388
02:57:01,100 --> 02:57:03,899
It's all right. All right, let's go. Investigate the AR tech.

2389
02:57:04,500 --> 02:57:07,700
No, let's continue to grow our elderly population.

2390
02:57:20,379 --> 02:57:20,879
Old.

2391
02:57:25,959 --> 02:57:26,459
Old!

2392
02:57:40,309 --> 02:57:41,110
Okay, let's go.

2393
02:57:45,709 --> 02:57:46,709
How do I, okay, recruit.

2394
02:57:54,799 --> 02:57:56,100
What does it, what does it say? What's the bio?

2395
02:57:57,409 --> 02:58:00,309
Uh, doesn't like view, doesn't like me?

2396
02:58:04,629 --> 02:58:05,329
View the bio?

2397
02:58:05,770 --> 02:58:10,670
Has been owed 80 quid by a DedSec member since 2021.

2398
02:58:11,590 --> 02:58:12,690
Doesn't like DedSec.

2399
02:58:15,020 --> 02:58:16,219
Age 55.

2400
02:58:17,500 --> 02:58:18,299
Oh shit.

2401
02:58:18,799 --> 02:58:19,299
Never mind.

2402
02:58:32,770 --> 02:58:34,170
Wait, it said feet?

2403
02:58:44,420 --> 02:58:45,219
Old!

2404
02:58:45,319 --> 02:58:46,819
All right, I'll do a mission with the old lady.

2405
02:58:47,020 --> 02:58:47,520
Let's go.

2406
02:58:54,079 --> 02:58:55,079
The AR tech.

2407
02:58:56,659 --> 02:58:58,459
You are so stupid.

2408
02:58:59,549 --> 02:59:00,250
Oh my God!

2409
02:59:02,149 --> 02:59:02,549
I'm okay.

2410
02:59:06,750 --> 02:59:07,450
Oh, no.

2411
02:59:07,750 --> 02:59:20,239
No, not old.

2412
02:59:20,340 --> 02:59:24,819
Holy shit, this is a million miles away.

2413
02:59:26,829 --> 02:59:28,430
This is so far away. Can I fast travel?

2414
02:59:32,489 --> 02:59:33,790
Fast travel, where's a fast travel?

2415
02:59:36,030 --> 02:59:36,329
Here we go.

2416
02:59:46,790 --> 02:59:47,889
Recruit more old people.

2417
02:59:47,889 --> 02:59:48,389
I'm gonna.

2418
03:00:01,090 --> 03:00:02,690
Don't you think we need new clothes for this person?

2419
03:00:09,879 --> 03:00:11,079
Okay, outerwear.

2420
03:00:12,969 --> 03:00:14,670
Is there like bathrobe or something?

2421
03:00:19,139 --> 03:00:20,840
Oh, this is too, this is too cool.

2422
03:00:20,840 --> 03:00:21,639
This is cool.

2423
03:00:21,639 --> 03:00:22,440
I don't want cool.

2424
03:00:22,940 --> 03:00:23,739
I want casual.

2425
03:00:30,489 --> 03:00:31,190
All right, that's all right.

2426
03:00:33,899 --> 03:00:34,500
Not cool.

2427
03:00:39,750 --> 03:00:40,250
Glasses.

2428
03:00:40,250 --> 03:00:40,750
Yeah, all right.

2429
03:00:40,750 --> 03:00:41,549
We need glasses.

2430
03:00:46,700 --> 03:00:47,299
What about legs?

2431
03:00:50,020 --> 03:00:51,020
Drop legwear.

2432
03:00:51,319 --> 03:00:53,219
No, it's all this, this is dumb.

2433
03:00:53,219 --> 03:00:53,819
I don't want this.

2434
03:01:00,760 --> 03:01:04,149
Uh, we need, we got innerwear.

2435
03:01:10,129 --> 03:01:11,030
Oh, this is stupid.

2436
03:01:15,979 --> 03:01:16,680
What about outerwear?

2437
03:01:21,639 --> 03:01:22,940
Okay, this character sucks.

2438
03:01:30,879 --> 03:01:31,680
What about bag?

2439
03:01:32,639 --> 03:01:33,540
A little backpack?

2440
03:01:37,790 --> 03:01:38,389
All right, that's good.

2441
03:01:42,020 --> 03:01:43,319
Zoomer boomer.

2442
03:01:46,040 --> 03:01:49,239
No, yeah, this isn't every one of those movies where

2443
03:01:49,440 --> 03:01:50,739
the 15 year old

2444
03:01:50,940 --> 03:01:53,040
switches brains with like the 50 year old.

2445
03:01:55,180 --> 03:01:56,780
And then as the

2446
03:01:57,079 --> 03:01:58,780
13 year old 50 year old,

2447
03:01:58,780 --> 03:01:59,780
they dress like this.

2448
03:02:04,729 --> 03:02:07,229
And then they use some crazy teen lingo

2449
03:02:07,229 --> 03:02:08,229
when they're ordering a coffee

2450
03:02:08,229 --> 03:02:09,329
and everybody looks around they're like

2451
03:02:09,629 --> 03:02:11,129
yeah, I'll take a double shot of that

2452
03:02:11,229 --> 03:02:12,329
and it's gonna be lit.

2453
03:02:13,059 --> 03:02:13,760
And everyone around is like

2454
03:02:13,760 --> 03:02:15,360
what the old lady said that?

2455
03:02:15,559 --> 03:02:16,659
That's strange.

2456
03:02:32,850 --> 03:02:34,889
Wait, isn't this the same guy?

2457
03:02:44,319 --> 03:02:45,920
It's the same people from last time.

2458
03:02:46,020 --> 03:02:46,920
Wait, play darts.

2459
03:02:49,059 --> 03:02:50,059
That's not what I wanted to do.

2460
03:02:51,590 --> 03:02:52,889
That's not what I wanted to do.

2461
03:02:53,090 --> 03:03:02,000
Let's play darts.

2462
03:03:02,299 --> 03:03:03,399
Take the mask off.

2463
03:03:06,770 --> 03:03:08,270
I collect, I didn't mean to click.

2464
03:03:10,760 --> 03:03:11,659
Let's play darts.

2465
03:03:15,559 --> 03:03:16,860
I have no idea how to play darts

2466
03:03:16,860 --> 03:03:18,459
and I don't even care to read this.

2467
03:03:21,750 --> 03:03:22,750
I'll just get into the middle.

2468
03:03:28,899 --> 03:03:29,899
Aim, throw.

2469
03:03:43,139 --> 03:03:43,840
Fuck this.

2470
03:03:58,940 --> 03:04:00,340
People are pissing their pants?

2471
03:04:03,540 --> 03:04:04,639
That's a double bull.

2472
03:04:22,780 --> 03:04:23,479
Are they saying that

2473
03:04:24,079 --> 03:04:25,680
I have a gun?

2474
03:05:05,709 --> 03:05:07,409
I just have a gun in my hand.

2475
03:05:09,319 --> 03:05:17,579
I just want to play darts.

2476
03:05:22,659 --> 03:05:23,260
I win.

2477
03:05:26,170 --> 03:05:26,770
Gun.

2478
03:05:27,309 --> 03:05:28,510
Look out, gun.

2479
03:05:29,459 --> 03:05:30,760
She's got a gun.

2480
03:05:47,409 --> 03:05:48,010
What was that?

2481
03:05:48,010 --> 03:05:49,610
Was that Nathan Drake over there?

2482
03:05:50,309 --> 03:05:51,610
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2483
03:06:03,180 --> 03:06:04,479
This guy keeps pissing his pants.

2484
03:06:22,909 --> 03:06:24,209
Okay, get me the fuck out of here.

2485
03:06:26,639 --> 03:06:27,639
Who's talking shit?

2486
03:06:45,850 --> 03:06:46,649
Hard mode, I win.

2487
03:06:47,510 --> 03:06:47,909
All right.

2488
03:06:48,110 --> 03:06:50,559
So now let's go do this mission.

2489
03:07:00,639 --> 03:07:01,440
Where's the gambling?

2490
03:07:01,440 --> 03:07:02,639
I don't think there's gambling in this game.

2491
03:07:05,670 --> 03:07:06,670
That was pretty sick.

2492
03:07:12,489 --> 03:07:14,290
Realistic old lady driving.

2493
03:07:15,719 --> 03:07:16,520
No, it's not.

2494
03:07:19,940 --> 03:07:20,540
Now it is.

2495
03:07:35,739 --> 03:07:36,940
That's a broken back.

2496
03:07:37,340 --> 03:07:38,239
Holy shit.

2497
03:07:38,239 --> 03:07:39,139
That was horrible.

2498
03:07:39,829 --> 03:07:40,530
She's fine.

2499
03:07:40,530 --> 03:07:41,229
She's all right.

2500
03:07:42,059 --> 03:07:43,860
She's still got a little bit of spunk.

2501
03:07:51,819 --> 03:07:52,420
What are you doing?

2502
03:07:53,719 --> 03:07:54,719
No, what are you doing?

2503
03:07:55,020 --> 03:07:55,620
Get on the bike.

2504
03:07:57,979 --> 03:07:58,680
She's confused.

2505
03:07:58,780 --> 03:08:06,100
Shattered hip.

2506
03:08:14,620 --> 03:08:15,420
My stomach.

2507
03:08:18,930 --> 03:08:20,430
I can't stop thinking about the darts.

2508
03:08:24,299 --> 03:08:26,600
These are GTA 3 tier jokes.

2509
03:08:27,909 --> 03:08:29,909
I mean, is it a joke or am I just...

2510
03:08:30,409 --> 03:08:31,709
Is this game just fucking...

2511
03:08:37,940 --> 03:08:39,739
I was looking at the chat.

2512
03:08:40,139 --> 03:08:40,639
Fuck.

2513
03:08:44,639 --> 03:08:46,139
Red dead all over again.

2514
03:08:48,729 --> 03:08:49,430
What are you doing?

2515
03:08:56,639 --> 03:08:57,739
What the fuck?

2516
03:09:00,229 --> 03:09:01,030
Get off.

2517
03:09:14,819 --> 03:09:16,319
City's fighting back.

2518
03:09:32,899 --> 03:09:33,299
Wait.

2519
03:09:33,299 --> 03:09:35,000
Oh, I'm getting super deja vu.

2520
03:09:35,000 --> 03:09:35,399
This is...

2521
03:09:36,500 --> 03:09:38,100
I was here already with a different person.

2522
03:09:47,969 --> 03:09:49,069
Okay, let's go in here.

2523
03:09:50,870 --> 03:09:51,170
All right.

2524
03:09:51,170 --> 03:09:52,069
Rainy's ready to go.

2525
03:09:58,819 --> 03:10:00,719
Investigate the AR tech.

2526
03:10:11,059 --> 03:10:12,559
Security lasers will alert guards.

2527
03:10:12,559 --> 03:10:13,760
Disable them by hacking them.

2528
03:10:21,909 --> 03:10:22,110
All right.

2529
03:10:22,110 --> 03:10:22,409
What about...

2530
03:10:22,409 --> 03:10:22,709
How do I...

2531
03:10:22,709 --> 03:10:23,510
I need to hack them.

2532
03:10:24,879 --> 03:10:25,479
Is there a camera?

2533
03:10:33,129 --> 03:10:33,430
All right.

2534
03:10:33,629 --> 03:10:34,229
Mask on.

2535
03:10:40,500 --> 03:10:41,200
Power this shit up.

2536
03:10:47,280 --> 03:10:47,579
Now what?

2537
03:10:48,790 --> 03:10:51,489
Launch AR reconstruction test.

2538
03:10:53,790 --> 03:10:54,989
How the fuck do I do that?

2539
03:10:59,819 --> 03:11:00,719
Wait, is this a trap door?

2540
03:11:00,719 --> 03:11:02,020
Can I like trap somebody in there?

2541
03:11:03,229 --> 03:11:03,530
Wait.

2542
03:11:03,829 --> 03:11:04,129
Can I...

2543
03:11:04,329 --> 03:11:05,829
I can't like pancake throw him or anything.

2544
03:11:05,829 --> 03:11:06,229
Can I?

2545
03:11:18,200 --> 03:11:18,600
I guess.

2546
03:11:19,500 --> 03:11:19,799
All right.

2547
03:11:20,719 --> 03:11:21,219
Oh, fuck.

2548
03:11:21,219 --> 03:11:21,920
There's a guy right there.

2549
03:11:32,899 --> 03:11:33,299
What?

2550
03:11:37,860 --> 03:11:38,260
Cool.

2551
03:11:42,559 --> 03:11:43,459
Ethereal.

2552
03:11:43,860 --> 03:11:45,059
And strange.

2553
03:11:45,559 --> 03:11:46,959
Nobody suspects the old lady.

2554
03:11:54,959 --> 03:11:55,959
Old diaper.

2555
03:11:59,750 --> 03:12:00,450
You're gonna raid?

2556
03:12:03,079 --> 03:12:04,379
Oh, this Ludwig.

2557
03:12:05,440 --> 03:12:06,540
Ludwig raid.

2558
03:12:07,239 --> 03:12:08,239
What's going on everybody?

2559
03:12:09,879 --> 03:12:10,479
Thanks Ludwig.

2560
03:12:10,979 --> 03:12:11,979
Hope you had a good stream today.

2561
03:12:15,200 --> 03:12:17,000
Today we're playing a game that I...

2562
03:12:17,299 --> 03:12:19,200
I'm so glad you raided now

2563
03:12:19,200 --> 03:12:20,500
and not like three hours ago

2564
03:12:20,500 --> 03:12:22,100
when I had to update my graphics drivers

2565
03:12:22,100 --> 03:12:22,799
like three times.

2566
03:12:24,600 --> 03:12:25,000
This game...

2567
03:12:25,000 --> 03:12:25,299
I...

2568
03:12:25,399 --> 03:12:25,799
By the way,

2569
03:12:25,799 --> 03:12:27,299
I might have made this really clear to everybody.

2570
03:12:28,200 --> 03:12:28,600
My game...

2571
03:12:28,600 --> 03:12:29,399
My computer sucks

2572
03:12:29,399 --> 03:12:31,100
and I can't run this fucking shitty game.

2573
03:12:31,200 --> 03:12:31,500
Why?

2574
03:12:31,500 --> 03:12:32,399
The game's not shitty.

2575
03:12:32,399 --> 03:12:32,899
Maybe it is.

2576
03:12:36,819 --> 03:12:39,020
This is a fucking huge raid by the way.

2577
03:12:40,020 --> 03:12:41,319
This is a lot of people.

2578
03:12:43,819 --> 03:12:44,819
15k.

2579
03:12:44,819 --> 03:12:46,120
Holy shit Ludwig.

2580
03:12:47,819 --> 03:12:49,219
If you guys don't follow Ludwig,

2581
03:12:49,219 --> 03:12:51,120
he's one of the funniest people on Twitch.

2582
03:12:52,180 --> 03:12:52,479
He's just...

2583
03:12:52,479 --> 03:12:53,579
He's like a content king.

2584
03:12:53,579 --> 03:12:54,379
He's got it going on.

2585
03:12:54,379 --> 03:12:54,879
Trust me.

2586
03:13:02,139 --> 03:13:03,040
Freudian slip.

2587
03:13:03,040 --> 03:13:03,340
All right.

2588
03:13:03,340 --> 03:13:05,239
Let me get back to what I was doing.

2589
03:13:06,139 --> 03:13:06,840
Oh, by the way,

2590
03:13:06,840 --> 03:13:08,840
I know that Ludwig says he could beat me in a fight.

2591
03:13:11,139 --> 03:13:11,540
It depends.

2592
03:13:11,540 --> 03:13:12,639
Are we allowed to bring weapons?

2593
03:13:19,149 --> 03:13:20,149
25k.

2594
03:13:20,149 --> 03:13:20,750
Oh shit.

2595
03:13:20,750 --> 03:13:21,149
Hold on.

2596
03:13:21,149 --> 03:13:21,850
There's people here.

2597
03:13:24,120 --> 03:13:24,520
Oh no.

2598
03:13:24,520 --> 03:13:25,120
No, no, no.

2599
03:13:28,399 --> 03:13:29,000
Anybody hear this?

2600
03:13:36,530 --> 03:13:38,030
I'm pushing him back into his spawn.

2601
03:13:42,159 --> 03:13:42,559
Okay.

2602
03:13:42,559 --> 03:13:43,260
What the fuck?

2603
03:13:45,610 --> 03:13:46,409
Where am I?

2604
03:13:46,709 --> 03:13:47,909
I don't like it in the dark.

2605
03:13:48,209 --> 03:13:49,010
Oh shit.

2606
03:13:50,909 --> 03:13:51,809
Yeah, this is Mike.

2607
03:13:52,409 --> 03:13:52,909
I happen to be...

2608
03:13:52,909 --> 03:13:54,409
I think somebody locked me in a freezer.

2609
03:13:58,549 --> 03:13:58,850
What?

2610
03:13:58,850 --> 03:13:59,649
Wiped his nose?

2611
03:14:02,569 --> 03:14:02,870
Get...

2612
03:14:03,959 --> 03:14:05,860
Get the fuck out here and let me end this.

2613
03:14:14,629 --> 03:14:15,430
What the hell did I...

2614
03:14:22,819 --> 03:14:23,819
Okay, we got him.

2615
03:14:23,819 --> 03:14:24,420
He's dead.

2616
03:14:25,670 --> 03:14:26,569
I fell onto...

2617
03:14:26,569 --> 03:14:27,670
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2618
03:14:28,610 --> 03:14:29,209
Escape?

2619
03:14:31,649 --> 03:14:32,250
Oh shit.

2620
03:14:32,250 --> 03:14:32,750
Okay.

2621
03:14:32,750 --> 03:14:33,250
I'm in...

2622
03:14:37,860 --> 03:14:38,659
Can I pick up that shotgun?

2623
03:14:42,649 --> 03:14:43,149
Give me the shotgun.

2624
03:14:46,639 --> 03:14:47,340
I just have to leave.

2625
03:14:53,920 --> 03:14:55,319
Minus 10k, Andy.

2626
03:14:56,840 --> 03:14:57,840
That's what happens on...

2627
03:14:57,840 --> 03:14:58,739
Hey, it's all right.

2628
03:15:00,440 --> 03:15:01,040
No, seriously.

2629
03:15:01,040 --> 03:15:01,940
Thanks to the raid though, Ludwig.

2630
03:15:05,280 --> 03:15:06,180
What do I have to do?

2631
03:15:08,379 --> 03:15:10,079
You didn't sing the raid song.

2632
03:15:10,079 --> 03:15:10,579
Fuck.

2633
03:15:16,780 --> 03:15:18,979
Wait, am I getting locked out of what I want to do?

2634
03:15:21,020 --> 03:15:21,719
I can't...

2635
03:15:22,920 --> 03:15:24,590
I can't play as grandma anymore?

2636
03:15:27,889 --> 03:15:28,590
Oh shit.

2637
03:15:28,590 --> 03:15:29,090
Oh shit.

2638
03:15:29,090 --> 03:15:29,930
Oh shit.

2639
03:15:29,930 --> 03:15:30,530
Oh shit.

2640
03:15:30,530 --> 03:15:31,129
Oh shit.

2641
03:15:31,129 --> 03:15:31,629
Oh shit.

2642
03:15:31,629 --> 03:15:32,129
Oh shit.

2643
03:15:32,129 --> 03:15:32,530
Oh shit.

2644
03:15:32,530 --> 03:15:33,030
Oh shit.

2645
03:15:33,030 --> 03:15:33,530

You suck at driving. It's that easy to get away from the cops in this game. You just hold W

This is for you the tooth. Oh, it's a no idea technically. Yeah, it's a Bluetooth

2712
03:29:57,719 --> 03:30:06,610
This is a big decision once I joined that sec. I can't have a normal life anymore. I get it darling

2713
03:30:06,610 --> 03:30:12,649
But is it normal Albion can now execute us. I can't believe that Ubisoft was able to make this happen

2714
03:30:15,329 --> 03:30:17,329
60 million people that live in London

2715
03:30:18,010 --> 03:30:21,129
60 million different voice actors. It's kind of unbelievable

2716
03:30:21,909 --> 03:30:39,149
That's crazy. It's definitely not 12 people right paste it over every single person you get. Okay. I'm ready the resistance

2717
03:30:39,510 --> 03:30:51,780

2724
03:32:08,889 --> 03:32:11,329
I guess yeah, pretty illegal

2725
03:32:14,719 --> 03:32:17,379
Havoc to wheel and summon the cargo drone

2726
03:32:17,600 --> 03:32:21,280
Where it's out of reach so you'll need to use a heavy cargo drone to steal it

2727
03:32:21,920 --> 03:32:46,889
Okay, where is it? Let's be out of the car. Oh, right. Well, I'm onto a cargo drone and hijack it

2728
03:33:00,329 --> 03:33:10,440

03:33:59,000 --> 03:34:01,559
Okay, this is got way cooler than it was ever I ever thought it was gonna be

2734
03:34:09,870 --> 03:34:21,020

2737
03:35:04,940 --> 03:35:12,229
I've loaded the server into your vehicle. You can go now careful on the road now throw her in the ocean

2738
03:35:12,510 --> 03:35:14,510
We don't we don't need her anymore

2739
03:35:15,149 --> 03:35:22,739
I don't be this guy who wants to be?

2740
03:35:23,540 --> 03:35:27,829
Justin whatever his name is

2741
03:35:38,920 --> 03:35:44,100
Ringo

2742
03:35:44,100 --> 03:35:52,379
I need a wider sample of data. So I'm pushing you the coordinates to a new location. That was pretty sick. Okay, let's keep going

2743
03:36:04,690 --> 03:36:06,690
Watch dogs three

2744
03:36:10,530 --> 03:36:12,290
Not even watch dogs three

2745
03:36:12,290 --> 03:36:21,329
This is what this is this is watch dogs to with a different story and different characters to play as not watch dogs three

2746
03:36:21,969 --> 03:36:30,969
It was but they didn't number it. Oh, use me

2747
03:36:31,770 --> 03:36:44,030
Okay, if the grip the grip if you were watching shrouds stream right now

2748
03:36:44,569 --> 03:36:49,559
And the graphics weren't as bad as they are in my stream number two, by the way, we're number two

2749
03:36:50,120 --> 03:36:53,129
Would you would the game be better for you?

2750
03:36:58,040 --> 03:37:00,040
Jesus don't say that

2751
03:37:00,399 --> 03:37:21,430
No, you're number four now what before what?

2752
03:37:22,110 --> 03:37:32,639
Fourth place. It's okay. I still get two points in Mario Kart

2753
03:37:47,170 --> 03:37:49,170
Hack in more viewers now

2754
03:37:55,649 --> 03:37:58,690
What the fuck did I just do what happened

2755
03:38:01,889 --> 03:38:05,370
Oh for fuck's sake all right transfer complete

2756
03:38:10,729 --> 03:38:12,450
It was a drone

2757
03:38:12,450 --> 03:38:13,610
Okay

2758
03:38:13,610 --> 03:38:29,459
Let's go. I kind of started like Justin now. What else does he have? He's got loyalty card

2759
03:38:29,780 --> 03:38:47,680
Run a face cam. You'll get more views. No, it's alright. It's okay. It's it's fine

2760
03:38:47,680 --> 03:38:56,040
I go all the way around when you can just go like this

2761
03:38:56,559 --> 03:39:21,920
He's naked. Yes, he is. I do not have a shirt on you're right. I never stream with clothes on you are accurate

2762
03:39:22,159 --> 03:39:36,579
It's just been paint. I paint my clothes on

2763
03:39:37,100 --> 03:39:43,239
It was an old SNL skit from

2764
03:39:43,799 --> 03:39:46,700
25 years ago about shirt in a can

2765
03:39:47,319 --> 03:39:48,760
It's pretty funny

2766
03:39:48,760 --> 03:39:54,010
They have somebody sprays it on him

2767
03:39:54,010 --> 03:39:58,309
It's like a shirt in a can and they spray it all over the body and the guy starts going it's burning my skin

2768
03:39:58,829 --> 03:40:01,709
And I thought it was really funny

2769
03:40:01,709 --> 03:40:24,770
Boomer humor, so this mission sucks

2770
03:40:28,409 --> 03:40:31,610
Do I have to protect this it all right

2771
03:40:49,399 --> 03:40:54,709
They love the drones they love drone so much in this game, it's like their favorite thing ever

2772
03:40:54,709 --> 03:41:16,819
I know whatever NA aim NA 25 FPS aim. I'm losing DPI on every move

2773
03:41:37,239 --> 03:41:41,079
This was better when it didn't work and when you were having trouble

2774
03:41:41,879 --> 03:41:49,180
Really? Well now that the game works. It's just the game now true. Oh, come on

2775
03:41:49,700 --> 03:41:53,760
Well, you don't want me to watch a loading bar while I shoot drones

2776
03:42:02,299 --> 03:42:06,520
Oh CB CBD

2777
03:42:07,760 --> 03:42:14,200
Should destroy both the server and the drones. So, you know, yeah

2778
03:42:14,719 --> 03:42:17,909
Go, please

2779
03:42:17,909 --> 03:42:28,639
Heist made life a bit harder for the tyrants of the world

2780
03:42:33,200 --> 03:42:35,200
All right, I did it

2781
03:42:36,399 --> 03:42:45,889
Wait, he doesn't put his bare asshole in his computer chair, right? Why why do you think I put my

2782
03:42:46,489 --> 03:43:04,840
That to be a thing that was possible. I don't have to do the whole mission, right? No, I don't

2783
03:43:07,600 --> 03:43:11,440
You want you talking with me placing my asshole into the gamer chair

2784
03:43:11,959 --> 03:43:31,190
Permadeath no, I have to you have to unlock permadeath. No, that's not made up. You actually do. All right, let's teleport

2785
03:43:31,709 --> 03:43:50,899
It activates after this mission. All right, sounds cool. All right, let's do. Ooh. Look there. She is

2786
03:44:02,139 --> 03:44:05,340
AAA video game stream

2787
03:44:13,799 --> 03:44:15,799
On lunch

2788
03:44:17,440 --> 03:44:19,440
Build back our arsenal

2789
03:44:24,120 --> 03:44:26,120
We just need to show them

2790
03:44:28,680 --> 03:44:34,979
Yeah, I just need to kick the shit out of the people who are fucking up London only two of us forget

2791
03:44:36,280 --> 03:44:41,879
The fuck is that the city? I won't stand for that. We have another problem on our hands

2792
03:44:41,879 --> 03:44:44,399
Did we get a random person because I didn't recruit enough people

2793
03:44:48,360 --> 03:44:51,600
They took out dead sex once and it's a good bet. They'll try again

2794
03:44:51,600 --> 03:44:55,399
I believe they were responsible for the bombings and the construction worker. Okay

2795
03:45:03,190 --> 03:45:11,450
Killed the other two. Oh shit, that's right. We had five and I ran to him over the car. You're right

2796
03:45:12,049 --> 03:45:18,430
Permadeath is now active. Okay now if everyone dies the game ends

2797
03:45:18,709 --> 03:45:45,309
I only three people what I got permissions. Okay answer the call just digging up the power. All right, let's go with our

2798
03:45:45,870 --> 03:45:51,360
our Queen here

2799
03:45:58,290 --> 03:46:00,290
There's our Queen

2800
03:46:00,770 --> 03:46:02,770
Yes, Queen

2801
03:46:04,649 --> 03:46:06,649

People saying self. Oh, this is gonna be cool in the future

2833
03:53:25,899 --> 03:53:36,729
Hey, I feel like self-driving cars are at the stage right now where VR was 15 years ago

2834
03:53:36,930 --> 03:53:56,579
Where the virtual boy was cool, but it hurt and it was not ready people like oh, yeah

2835
03:53:56,579 --> 03:53:59,500
That'd be we're gonna have self-driving cars. We're gonna be in those self-driving cars

2836
03:53:59,500 --> 03:54:02,739
You're gonna be like going to work. Just like looking at your watch while the car drives you to work

2837
03:54:02,899 --> 03:54:04,899
I think that's like a hundred years from now

2838
03:54:05,100 --> 03:54:16,809
You know how many roads have to be completely redone in America think about every road that needs to be repainted

2839
03:54:17,010 --> 03:54:33,649
That's not how it works. Doesn't it read the lines on the road with like I'm near me like a scanner

2840
03:54:34,170 --> 03:54:53,950
What does it just say? There's other cars around me. Be careful. It uses cameras. It's motion sense cameras

2841
03:54:54,250 --> 03:55:01,040
That's the already does it. Yeah

2842
03:55:01,040 --> 03:55:06,500

2843
03:55:07,020 --> 03:55:26,690
Your destination it uses human brains, but what you guys don't know and what Elon Musk has been

2844
03:55:27,930 --> 03:55:34,450
I'm talking be quiet. Well, I must didn't tell you guys is it's just it's just people driving the car with a remote control

2845
03:55:34,850 --> 03:55:40,809
When you press the button somebody like bullshit, okay my turn in a giant center like call center

2846
03:55:41,170 --> 03:55:58,440
Okay, find the signal source at the attack site. Okay, sure. This is the worst fucking character to be right now

2847
03:55:58,760 --> 03:56:05,770
That's just in Guardians of the Galaxies. Thanks for the spoiler. I've never seen that movie

2848
03:56:06,290 --> 03:56:26,459
Need a key. All right, find the signal source at the attack site. Let's go who gives a fuck omega low

2849
03:56:26,899 --> 03:56:33,840
And when I talked about like season one of Game of Thrones two months ago, we're like, hey, hey

2850
03:56:34,559 --> 03:56:40,680
Don't say that. I get what all of a sudden somebody says that Guardians of the Galaxies

2851
03:56:40,680 --> 03:56:42,979
This is what happens at the end of the movie and I can't go hey

2852
03:56:42,979 --> 03:57:00,409
I don't think this character can do this mission not over the razor wire granny. Oh, there it is

2853
03:57:09,750 --> 03:57:31,940
Okay, I'm in. Oh, I need that. I need to hijack that losing signal. What? No, I'm right there. I'm right there

2854
03:57:31,940 --> 03:57:43,079
All right. This is the source the power right here granny on it. I don't think granny can granny go on it

2855
03:57:43,079 --> 03:58:16,940
I guess so. Okay, permadeath is on you're right. Why did I need to go?

2856
03:58:16,940 --> 03:58:30,579
Why did I have to pick her up and I just go in here on the source. Okay, I found it

2857
03:58:30,979 --> 03:58:46,000
Source of the power. This is a damaged spider-bot leg. What the fuck? Are you serious guys?

2858
03:58:49,260 --> 03:58:54,600
No indication yet who belongs to good god, it's been torn asunder

2859
03:58:55,319 --> 03:58:57,489
What is it doing here?

2860
03:58:57,649 --> 03:59:03,250
Difficult to say but with an AR reconstruction, we may be able to see what happened to it and if it relates to the attack

2861
03:59:03,729 --> 03:59:05,729
70% of people want to see you play a different game

2862

04:01:46,590 --> 04:01:48,760
I'm think I'm done with it

2876
04:01:48,879 --> 04:02:00,590
Let me try one more time. It's the the missions are kind of boring

2877
04:02:01,229 --> 04:02:20,860
Okay, let's go over here. Not even three hours. No, it was like four and a half

That's true. All right, it's true. My PC does suck. What's going on with this ever?

2887
04:04:24,930 --> 04:04:43,440
Increasing computer power that you need to play new video games if I computers only four years old. He's actually upset

2888
04:04:43,440 --> 04:04:56,530
I am NOT actually upset. I'm not even mad. I'm not mad. That was worst stream 2020. It's not my fault

Let's do a tier list. All right, we'll do one tier list. What do you got?
