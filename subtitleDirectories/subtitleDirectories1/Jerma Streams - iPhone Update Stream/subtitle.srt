1
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:18,730
On a fucking iPhone. Am I even live right now? I might be on my shitty iPhone. I can see the chat too, that's good.

2
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:26,539
I'm like right up in your face tonight. Where's the camera? Right here? Right there, okay.

3
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:32,409
Well, you're... Well, no, no, I can't, I can't talk yet. I need to wait till everybody's here.

4
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:42,740
This is gonna be like a 15 minute stream because data! Ooh, I'm gonna be spending money on data!

5
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,899
This is where, I don't like this. I don't like this setup. I can like see myself

6
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:53,799
and I get the chat. I'm like, I'm... Can you hear me? Can you guys even hear what I'm saying?

7
00:00:53,799 --> 00:01:01,380
How shitty is this quality? Is this, is this like 2G? You can hear me? Okay, good.

8
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:07,159
Finally, I'm at least able to stream on my dog shit device. Is it like 240p? It's probably

9
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:21,459
worse than that. It's probably like 60p. Makes me look really old. Whatever. But I can't...

10
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:30,060
Where are my stats? Oh, there we go. I can see my stats. I can see you guys now. So we

11
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,659
still don't have internet. Our house is currently in a total... We got nothing.

12
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:45,189
We've got another line that's come on in and still doesn't work.

13
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:50,439
So now, there's a whole other scenario here where they have to do a lot of work.

14
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:56,439
This is why I'm coming to you from the phone. And that kind of segues into the next topic

15
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:04,099
here, which is because I don't know when I'm going to be able to stream from this office.

16
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:09,560
From... Let me get you guys on where you're used to, right? Hold on, here we go.

17
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,969
See? It's like nothing ever... It's like there's no difference. See? You can see my office in the

18
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:22,580
door like last time. But yes, it's an office. It's a goddamn office. Because it's not my

19
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:28,979
bedroom. It's another room that's used for the purposes of streaming. But... No, this is

20
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:34,340
going to hurt my arm. We're going to do this. That hurts my hand. That hurts my fingers.

21
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,909
There we go. So I don't know. I have no idea when we're actually going to be able to

22
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:45,800
reliably stream from this place. So what that means is that means I've decided to do something

23
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,939
that we've been talking about for a long time. And that is the green screen stream. Remember that?

24
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:54,490
Remember I was going to get in front of a green screen? I was going to go to a green

25
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:59,800
screen studio and do all that shit? Well, that's now happening much sooner than you think.

26
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:06,840
So let me break down how this is going to play out as you count the fucking neck rolls.

27
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:20,759
How many neck rolls do I have now? When did that happen? What the fuck? When did I get

28
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:26,229
like a turkey neck? Like a turtle? Whatever. You know, nobody even cares. You're not even

29
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:31,939
going to look at it. Well, now you are because I just said it. Anyways, so the purpose of this

30
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:38,819
stream is to kind of pad the time still to be able to actually live stream. So what's going

31
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:45,340
to happen is I'm going to say it and it's good. I gave the mod some warning here,

32
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:53,000
but the Discord is going to open up here with a new channel. And on that new channel

33
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,300
is going to be stalling. Well, I can't stall. I'm on like G right now. I'm going

34
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:03,379
to get a call from my provider and they're going to be like, oh yes, you use like 16

35
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:08,740
minutes of 240p data. That'll be $400. I'm going to be like.

36
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:18,300
So in the Discord, there's going to be a new channel. It's going to be action recommendations

37
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,399
because what we talked about before, a long time ago, months ago, when I first wanted to

38
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:28,819
do this idea, I'm going to get in front of a green screen in a professional studio,

39
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:31,699
not just like, oh, I'm going to put a green screen behind me. No, I'm going to, it's going

40
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:37,180
to be like a 50 foot space and I'm going to be able to do anything. We're talking,

41
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,910
I'm not going to give you any ideas. What you guys are going to have to do is come

42
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:46,759
up with about 30 of them, 30 actions that you want me to do. It's going to be a

43
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:53,240
nomination process. The mods are already aware and I'm not going to see what they are.

44
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:59,879
So you have, depending on how long it takes for us to get the internet fixed,

45
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:07,660
I'm going to try to do this within the next three or four days. So that gives you at least

46
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:14,220
a couple of days to nominate some actions, which by the way, I get three vetoes. So

47
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:21,220
just remember that I get to veto at least three of these things that you want me to do

48
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,500
out of like 30. So you better get good ones because I'm going to have a big rubber stamp

49
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,819
that's going to be like, bang, I ain't doing that. But that's going to happen

50
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:37,129
starting tonight and into tomorrow and the next day. And then I'm going to that studio

51
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:43,720
and I'm going to broadcast from the studio. So that's the plan. Now, before we continue,

52
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:53,189
why are we at 280p? Because I'm on an iPhone on like shit internet. I'm on an iPhone right

53
00:05:53,189 --> 00:06:02,060
now. There's no internet in this. I don't have any internet. It just doesn't work.

54
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:08,490
I'm turning red. You said the word internet. No, I did. I said the word internet and I

55
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:17,399
just got red. Anyways, so I'm going to get to veto three of them, but let's go over rules.

56
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:22,730
Let's go over a couple of important things because I know how deeply this could go

57
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:30,060
totally south. What do I mean by that? All the mods have, they're going to delete

58
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:37,560
submissions that are sexual. No sexual bullshit. I'm not going to do anything in front of a

59
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,879
green screen. What you can do is, you know, I'm not going to happen. So use common sense

60
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:48,069
with what you'd like me to do in front of a green screen because they're going to get

61
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:59,800
picked out. Oh, am I dropping? Am I dropping frames on my iPhone screen? I just was for a

62
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:07,620
second. But yeah, so just use common sense. Like I ain't going to do anything like

63
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,220
fucked up in front of that green screen for you to then like, oh, let me like, dude,

64
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:16,250
let me put him here. Look what he just did. I mean, that's, that's the purpose of the whole

65
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:22,810
thing. I mean, but I'm talking like in, in like a bad sense, right? Cause what's going to happen

66
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:28,569
after that is after three or four days, I'm going to do the stream. We're going to do all

67
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:36,389
the actions and then I'm going to put on a host site or I might not even have to,

68
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:41,800
we'll see how the quality is. The footage, right? If you guys don't want to pull it from

69
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,949
the stream itself, then I'm going to put up probably raw footage somewhere. And then

70
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:56,009
it's you guys get to make whatever you want as long as it is okay. You know what I'm saying?

71
00:07:56,009 --> 00:08:00,420
And we're going to have a community event a couple of weeks later where we watch them all

72
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:04,389
on stream. All of them are going to get processed. Mods are going to watch them to

73
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:09,899
make sure. Like I said, no, nothing's going to slip through the cracks here. So we're going

74
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:14,970
to watch it. No, it doesn't, it doesn't need to be like PG 13. You can do some R rated

75
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,529
material like, you know, but nothing no like bullshit. Do you know what I mean? And you know

76
00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:23,529
exactly what I'm talking about. When I say that I don't even do it. I don't need to explain

77
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:34,919
what that means. No bullshit. Okay. Use your goddamn common sense. Yes. People, you guys

78
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:38,950
get it. You guys get it. But anyways, we're going to do a big community event where we watch

79
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,429
them and we watch what you guys have decided to do with the green screen footage. There's

80
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:49,029
going to be like probably like an hour of green screen material. I look forward to what

81
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:53,590
you guys do. Eye contact stream. Well, it's cause like it's right here. Would you rather

82
00:08:53,590 --> 00:09:01,139
me look over at the chat? Cause that's what I could do too. Free material. No, I mean,

83
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:06,419
well, look, look, look when the reason why this is an interesting idea is because

84
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:11,769
all the shit that you guys were doing with the bee stuff, like the wasp snapping and

85
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:17,049
everything. There's some creative fucking people in this community. And I'd like to

86
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:22,539
see it actually flourish, you know, not just like, Oh, there's me and I'll put a bee here.

87
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:26,059
I think that's really interesting to see what people will come up with.

88
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:31,450
And we're going to do a whole event. We're going to watch them all. So again, the discord is

89
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:35,879
going to open up with the new channel. All the suggestions go there. I'm not going to read them.

90
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:39,879
I'm not going to see them. I will not know what they are until I get the piece of paper

91
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,460
at the studio that I go to. And again, I get my big stamp that I'm going to stamp

92
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:50,440
out ones that I don't want to do three of them. So I wish I could give you an example

93
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:58,009
here. But if there is a certain, by the way, let's make this rule very, very clear as

94
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:04,570
well. If the, if there are no doubles, there are no doubles are going to be allowed here.

95
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:12,009
So if you put down, let's say, I don't know, like six or seven different dances,

96
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,980
I don't know. And they're all the same, like, no, no, no, no, no, no. You know doubles,

97
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:26,940
they got to be all unique or I'll fucking veto them. I'm just going to veto them all.

98
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:33,190
You want to see, you want to see this motherfucker do a dance, you bet your ass,

99
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:40,100
you better come to a consensus on it. Because I'll veto that shit. I'm already not looking

100
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,950
forward to it. And I already know what and I already just gave you the idea. I ain't doing

101
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,990
it. Just already know that that's that's good. That's that's going to get vetoed.

102
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:53,139
That's like an automatic veto. But I have some you buddy, you better have some better shit

103
00:10:53,139 --> 00:11:04,889
on there because I get three vetoes. Do a default dance, default. Well, what is it? What

104
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:13,529
even is a default dance? So no stream tonight? Well, no, unless you count this,

105
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:16,580
which I wouldn't because it's just a quick little thing. I just wanted to make sure that

106
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:23,450
I got people aware of what's happening and told people the, you know, what's going on

107
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:28,779
because you guys have waited at least three weeks, two or three weeks or so for

108
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:34,100
me to come back and it's like, hey, I'm back. No, I'm not just just just kidding.

109
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,610
So I want to do something fun while the internet's up because I don't have to use

110
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:42,309
I'm not going to be using my internet. I'll be in the studio. We streaming from there.

111
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:49,509
So in the next two days or so, try to come to a consensus over the next 48 hours of what

112
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:52,970
you'd want me to do for actions somewhere around with them. I've already talked to the

113
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:59,720
mods about it. So somewhere around like 25 to 30 ish dances. I mean, not dances. No,

114
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:08,019
I mean, 25 to 30 actions, 25 to 30 actions is going to put every single fortnight dance,

115
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:12,549
but that's not going to happen because that's two step. That would be counting as a double.

116
00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:15,750
If there's a fortnight dance on there, it's getting vetoed. I'm just, fuck it. Let's

117
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:21,750
just say it. And if you put it, if you put like 20 fortnight dances on it, it doesn't

118
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:26,330
double. So that doesn't count. You're not going to be able to do that. So it's just

119
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:30,500
getting fucking vetoed. You know what? Let's just go with this. Don't even put fortnight

120
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,779
on the list because I'm not doing it. Don't even do it. Pick something else. Do something

121
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:40,570
better. It is double. It's the same area. It's the same spot. It's the same company

122
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:49,220
that made the game and the same animating studio created it. I didn't want to say

123
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:59,860
it, but I had to. Now this is not epic, but yeah. So that'll be in the next few days.

124
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,419
Come to a consensus on what you want me to do. And by the way, if you do mention props,

125
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:08,860
right? I'll give you an example of one that I would definitely wouldn't veto at all.

126
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:13,340
Absolutely not. That German getting lost kayaking, right? Like, I mean, that's,

127
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,779
that's a fairly non vetoable fun thing that I could do in front of a green

128
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:20,139
screen with the whole kayak there and be like, oh, rapids, right? I mean,

129
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:24,460
that's a pretty good idea. If there are props involved, I'm going to need to know,

130
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:29,850
right? Like I'm going to need to know what props. So if you do want to include

131
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,649
props, it's got to be something that I can obtain. That's not going to cost a

132
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:39,059
shitload of money because it is that I'm going to have to improvise. Are they

133
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:49,830
going to what? This chat is too small. I don't like being that close. Do a

134
00:13:49,830 --> 00:14:02,789
little action clown. I that would be tough. You'll see what you come up with

135
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:06,389
for the most part, though, try to keep it something I can do on my own.

136
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:09,659
And if there's going to be a shitload of props, maybe the mods can get

137
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:12,539
involved there and make it so I don't have to buy like a bunch of fucking

138
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:16,009
weird shit on like Amazon, you know, I still, and that's like,

139
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:18,330
even if I get two days shipping, it's going to take me a couple of days to get

140
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:26,009
some of those props, but you'll see. We'll get it going. Any questions?

141
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:30,899
People are subscribing and giving money and shit and I can't even keep up with

142
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:36,070
it. I'm so sorry. Thank you, everybody that came in here. You got questions.

143
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:42,970
Okay. How you doing? I'm doing pretty good. That's pretty good question.

144
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:49,909
No questions. What's your favorite Fortnite dance? What's probably this

145
00:14:49,909 --> 00:14:56,980
one? I think it's definitely this one, but the kid goes like, right,

146
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:04,460
but like the backpack kid, something like that. Should I just did a, I

147
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:22,230
just did a Fortnite dance. I like, you like my ladder? That's because I can

148
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,659
reach up there. You know what I'm saying? It's hard to put those up there.

149
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:33,379
Well, you're not that, uh, I mean look at how strong I am though.

150
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:39,500
Come on. Give me a break. Give me a break. These ceilings are like 15

151
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,539
fucking feet tall. Even if you were 6'2", you wouldn't be able to get up

152
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:47,259
there. It's like, this ceiling's a fucking

153
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:59,610
30 feet tall. Ah, all right. Any, any real questions?

154
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:02,009
I'm trying to think about if I didn't, if I missed anything. All right,

155
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:05,769
let's go, let's break it down one more time real quickly.

156
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:10,009
No internet still. It's getting resolved. It will be resolved

157
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:14,009
soon. Hopefully. I have no ETA. Because of that,

158
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:17,909
iPhone stream. Internet phone stream. iPhone stream. That's why I'm here

159
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:21,429
doing this. iPhone stream. Uh, uh, because of

160
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:25,350
that, streaming from a studio in probably three or four days.

161
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,789
Studio stream. Green screen stream. Go to the discord. Get your

162
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:31,750
nominations in. Find out what you want me to do. 30 actions.

163
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,190
No bullshit. No dumb shit. I mean, well, no bullshit.

164
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,809
You, you. That guy right there that said that exactly what you want me to do

165
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:41,129
right there. I'm not going to do it. Make sure you get that figured out.

166
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:45,460
No bullshit. Come to a consensus. No doubles.

167
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:57,500
And that's it. Are you actually, am I a house tour?

168
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,139
No, I don't want you to know what's in my house.

169
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:10,630
Here, I'll give you a tour. Let's just show you this, by the way.

170
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:16,180
You see how, do you see this? Do you think you can reach up there?

171
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:21,430
This is, this is a five-foot ladder. So right now,

172
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:29,160
right now, I am like 15 feet tall. You see? Like, I'm, I'm, the ceiling is

173
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,759
still here. And look at this. My arm is like a good two feet.

174
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:38,200
I'm 5'8". This is five feet. This is like a 12-foot ceiling. You think you,

175
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,279
you think you're so funny? Oh fuck! He's gonna fall!

176
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:47,930
Oh! That wasn't, look, there's not much I can do with a

177
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:53,160
phone in my hand. I, like, I, I, I'm, I'm, I'm...

178
00:17:53,160 --> 00:18:03,259
All right. I'm glad we had this conversation. I'm not touring the house.

179
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:06,740
There could be like shit over there that I don't want you to see. Like,

180
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,500
I don't know. I don't like house tours. I don't, like, I don't know why people

181
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,819
do that. Okay, let's go ahead. Over here.

182
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:18,579
Hey, that's where I sleep every night. That's right in that bed.

183
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:22,019
Oh, there's like underwear on the ground. Let me just move that out of the way.

184
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:25,380
What's this? I just like, this is like my dirty underwear.

185
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,200
Whoops, sorry. Oh, there's, by the way, there's my, oh,

186
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,160
let's go to the garage. There's my car. Oh, cool!

187
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,900
Hey, that's my fucking plates. No, no, you don't,

188
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:41,619
I don't want anyone to know where I sleep. Because then you'll know, like,

189
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:44,410
where the bed is. You know, you'll know what, like,

190
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,890
the window is. You'll know where the bed is.

191
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:51,609
Oh, it takes us some guy, like, oh, I'm gonna case that house. Where,

192
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:55,849
where, where's all the valuable shit? Oh, this is where I keep my safe of

193
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:59,289
money. You know, it's just right there. By the way, there's the window, or if

194
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:31,049
you're curious. I gotta get out there and fix that.

195
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:35,990
He's gonna fall. I'm not gonna fall. If I fell,

196
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:39,509
it's not like, what, I'm gonna fall like fucking five

197
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:51,029
feet. What happened to the other one? It's because I was screaming. That's

198
00:19:51,029 --> 00:20:00,650
good. Good? I don't think that's good.

199
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:04,630
This is just barely hanging on now. What, what, what did you do?

200
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:14,380
What did you do? This took so long to do.

201
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:21,700
This took so fucking long to do. I gotta fix it later.

202
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,819
The whole thing is, the fucking whole thing.

203
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:34,619
Whatever. What the fuck. Oh, now I know how loud I can get in this. What

204
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:41,059
happened? Oh, that one fell too. Well, now I

205
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:42,900
know how loud I can get in this room before

206
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:48,380
stuff starts to fall off the fucking ceiling. Bad acoustics?

207
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:53,240
No, they are, they are fucked up. You're right.

208
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:59,940
You're actually right. Where's Otto? He's, he's

209
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,299
hanging out with Kim right now. He's like sleeping and I'm not going to wake

210
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:05,700
him up. There's bugs on the wall. Those are not,

211
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:10,900
all right, fine, fine. Those are fucking caterpillars.

212
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:20,329
Bugs on the wall. There's just like black slugs coming in. Oh yeah, those

213
00:21:20,329 --> 00:21:24,299
are, those are slugs. They're everywhere in this place.

214
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:33,259
You want me to eat one? Want me to eat one of those caterpillars on stream?

215
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:36,309
All right, I'm gonna run out of data. I gotta get out of here. I'm

216
00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:40,230
gonna get a fucking call from Verizon. They're gonna be like, oh, excuse me.

217
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,230
Do you wish that you could have our service?

218
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:45,910
Verizon Fios, the best fucking service ever, like

219
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:52,890
absolute number one internet ever. Don't you wish you could get that?

220
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:57,000
You guys know, I'll shill it every day. I swear to God.

221
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:07,859
You know that's $39 a month for a 100-100 Verizon Fios connection?

222
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:12,500
Why won't you just expand? We, please, I want that internet.

223
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:18,789
Give it to me. I'll pay quadruple. I'll pay septuple for that internet.

224
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:27,579
Most reliable network in the fucking world. That's time, it's time to move

225
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:33,380
again. All right, time to move back to Boston.

226
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:40,569
They got Fios there. Desperate streamer sells out for

227
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:46,390
internet. No, it's gonna be fine. From the

228
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,509
understanding that we've had, it's not like, oh, the internet just

229
00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:54,859
sucks here. No, it is just a, there's just a problem that needs to be solved

230
00:22:54,859 --> 00:22:59,369
and then we're gonna have lightning-fast speeds from, I'm not gonna even say

231
00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:01,930
their name, because I wanted to work first, you know

232
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:06,940
what I'm saying? I already did. I already did, you're right.

233
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:16,950
Never mind. Lightning-fast. Show the ladder before I leave.

234
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:28,650
Why? I don't get it. Why do you want to see the ladder? I don't get it.

235
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:38,680
But what? Prove the height of the ladder. Oh, it's staring fucking down.
