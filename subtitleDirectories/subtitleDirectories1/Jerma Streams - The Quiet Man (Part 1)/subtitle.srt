1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:11,669
Your tail is my favorite game ever made. Hey guys, how you doing? Hopefully things are going well.

2
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:23,719
That is banana. That is peanut butter. And that is almond milk. One, two, three. The trifecta.

3
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:33,179
Jeremy, what's the latest smoothie that you're drinking right now? Because every six months

4
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:40,009
you talk about a smoothie. Well, hold on a minute here. Banana. One banana. Two scoops of

5
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:53,939
peanut butter. Almond milk. Into a glass. Slurp it up. I got coffee here too. I got a peanut

6
00:00:53,939 --> 00:01:05,060
butter banana smoothie and I got a coffee. That was a blender, yeah. Am I doing well? I'm

7
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:14,620
doing well. I'm doing good. I'm doing good. So tonight we're going to play a game called

8
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:20,840
The Quiet Man, which is a Square Enix game. Kind of flew under the radar here for me,

9
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:32,120
but it's an FMV game that is also not an FMV game. It's like an action game with choices and

10
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:39,000
you play the main character is deaf. So I don't, you can't like hear. I don't know.

11
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:49,659
It is apparently awful, but it looked pretty, it looked like I had to play it. We'll just put

12
00:01:49,659 --> 00:02:07,540
it that way. This game isn't fun bad. It's bad bad. Well, we'll have to, I'm gonna stomach

13
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:11,060
through it. I don't think it's more than, I think it's only three or four hours long.

14
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,530
That's, let's just do it, right? Should I, am I going to be able to do this?

15
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:25,340
Or will I give up? The game isn't fun at all.

16
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,449
Here's something about, let's get out of here. Let's take a look at this.

17
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,580
Here's the menu. All right. So this is, this is one of the menus. Look at this menu.

18
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:58,150
Any idea what this shit is? When I, when I first loaded the game, it said,

19
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:04,090
this is subtitles and that's, they're on. This is supposed to be difficulty. So I think this is

20
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:10,819
mom yelling at little kid who's scared, but then this is normal mode. This is hard mode

21
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:18,300
where a little kid gets a Mario mushroom and screams at mom. I don't know how this means

22
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:25,379
it's harder. Like, is this, is that supposed to be me in this scenario? And this is the game.

23
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:30,099
Shouldn't it be the other way around? Or is this supposed to be me and this is the game?

24
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:39,099
Well, anyway, I don't, I have no idea what this is. They didn't tell me what this was.

25
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:47,669
It's just, this is a group of people that are highlighted now. I don't know what this is.

26
00:03:50,569 --> 00:04:15,430
Door? What do you mean door? Just hit play? What do you mean by door? Hold on. Kim,

27
00:04:15,430 --> 00:05:00,259
Kim is like texting me. Hold on a second. It was very, I ran down there and she,

28
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:08,439
she kept saying door. She's pointing at the door. I was like, okay, I opened the door

29
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:21,899
and then there's nothing there. Anyways, let's play. This is the quiet man. I think it's in

30
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:40,569
the right settings. I'm just going to press play. Door bottom right. All right. All right.

31
00:05:40,569 --> 00:06:06,649
Let's go. Seattle, 1998, New York. I mean, is this Spider-Man? Spider-Man full motion video

32
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:14,899
experience. That's me. I got, I've got the black Spider-Man suit on. I've got the venom suit on.

33
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,060
Wait, isn't this how infamous starts a prototype? I like that hair. That's good hair.

34
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:49,110
He's got great hair. This is a Square Enix game by the way. They, I don't know what they had

35
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,870
to do with this, but they apparently published it or maybe they made it. I don't know.

36
00:06:53,509 --> 00:07:15,240
Do I get to control the character? Why is the guy not talking? Why is he just putting his

37
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:22,889
sandwich in a bag? I didn't even order anything. This guy is just getting his lunch ready.

38
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,180
It's the sound. Does it make it quiet? Oh shit. I'll turn it up. I'll turn it up.

39
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:53,850
I'll turn it up. Oh, peanut butter and jelly again. Dad, can I at least get some

40
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,129
tuna fish next time? Remember that? Write that down. That's a map.

41
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:10,680
Now this guy steps to my lady and says, wait,

42
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,339
I'm not reading it.

43
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:35,100
Where'd the subtitles go? Why, why am I walking down this alley right now?

44
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:38,059
Is there a reason why I'm doing this?

45
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:48,220
Am I like a crime fighter? I don't understand. What am I doing?

46
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:54,860
Am I like trying to find back alleyways of people doing things wrong?

47
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:07,049
These guys are just sitting around talking. Okay, here we go.

48
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:14,230
What do I do? Do I have to press a button? Do I press a button?

49
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:20,460
Am I supposed to punch? I didn't do any of that.

50
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:35,049
Am I a robot? I'm a robot built by someone to patrol or something.

51
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:54,009
Now we're no longer a full motion video game. Now we're CG. How do I throw punches?

52
00:09:54,809 --> 00:10:03,080
Who do I target? What? Oh, I'm being electrocuted. This is immersion. What?

53
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:06,600
No, it's got the controller. It's got the controller.

54
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,019
How am I? What am I? How do I punch?

55
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:30,919
It didn't even tell me how to play the game. Okay, that's it. I did it.

56
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:52,889
Where is my tutorial? Where am I?

57
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:05,019
Weren't we just in full motion video? Why did we downgrade?

58
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,659
Is there a reason why the graphics is downgraded?

59
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:14,120
Well, wouldn't this be, this would cost more money doing full CG animations.

60
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,240
This costs more money than getting actors to act in front of the camera.

61
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,870
Options. Why does it give me the options, man? Why are they watching

62
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:28,629
a TV channel with options, man? Were they just playing Call of Duty and had to stop

63
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:41,379
because I came in? I don't understand. I think I lost.

64
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:57,559
This is, I don't like this. This is weird. Great stock footage.

65
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:05,980
What? Okay, so they have stock footage like hello, baby. I'm like kissing you. Hi, baby.

66
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:13,750
I'm a baby in a crib. Okay, this is a dodge. It's not very useful.

67
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:24,860
At least I have like a super dash. Is there anything else I can do?

68
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:37,669
At least a grab. Can I lock? What the fuck is happening?

69
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:44,250
Okay, left trigger activates quiet mode or something.

70
00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:49,860
Oh, that's right. It is on hard. This is not, I didn't, this,

71
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,899
this lower frame rate is proving to you that I'm not playing the game anymore.

72
00:12:53,620 --> 00:13:08,840
This is a rendered, uh, full rendered motion. What the fuck are you showing me?

73
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:26,250
Oh, this is, I can't, I get it. It's the controls. I see. Okay.

74
00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:37,669
So the X is punch. A is dodge. Wait, what was that? If you dodge perfectly,

75
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:43,620
then you get to punch him. B is also punch, somehow.

76
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:52,230
Why is kick? But why was grab? This is super mode. This is sprint.

77
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:06,039
Oh, no, that's not what I wanted to do. How do I get out of this? No.

78
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:14,889
Okay. The end. You beat it. So there's a sprint.

79
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:38,139
I don't know where I'm supposed to be going. Here we are. Back in time, I guess.

80
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:53,179
That me? That's supposed to be me. That guy did a pretty good green screen. That guy did.

81
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,659
You know, I mean, I mean, you stand in front of a green screen and you make a bunch of

82
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:07,049
all of a sudden, like now everybody wants to do it. Is there a lock on? I don't think there is.

83
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:18,679
I'm pretty sure there's no lock on. This has to be getting to a point where I can do something

84
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:31,159
else, right? Why are you watching me crying? Why? Why is it super imposing this shit on the

85
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:54,649
screen? What's going on? I don't even know what to say. I have nothing to say. I thought

86
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:59,850
we might have some stuff to talk about here, but we don't. We just don't. I'm beating the whole game,

87
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:25,690
by the way. Can you please play something else? Not yet. Nice. I got him in the tub. I did that.

88
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:42,090
I just got an achievement that says, Oh, what to say. I don't know what to say.

89
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm not. I don't know who we are. I don't know why we're doing this. I don't know. All

90
00:16:47,000 --> 00:17:02,809
I know is we got lunch in a bag. That's it. I was given a bag lunch club, club normies.

91
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:26,410
No, we're good. Jeremy, can you turn the game up? I can't hear it. I can't hear it either.

92
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,930
How am I supposed to make the decision? Should I make decisions?

93
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:55,319
You can't. I can't make any decisions. Well, that's mine now. Dub it. Okay. Yeah.

94
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,069
I can't think of anything. Hold on. I gotta take this.

95
00:18:04,869 --> 00:18:12,410
I was just like a lip matching it. Now here we go.

96
00:18:21,319 --> 00:19:10,250
20. Let's see. 40. 60. $100. There it is in the case.

97
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:15,859
Oh, you made it here. Finally. Didn't think you were going to show up.

98
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:30,420
Did you get lost out there somewhere? 25. 50. Yeah. $50. So here, here's all the money we took

99
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:47,829
in from. Oh, briefcase. Is that new? Wow. And you were the only person to remember my birthday.

100
00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:57,049
And I love Coke. I'm really glad you got this for me. Anyone watch you bring this in? I mean,

101
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:07,339
right on the chin. Me and you are going to do it together right now. Right. Anyways.

102
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:23,450
Let me take a look. Well, I know them. Yeah.

103
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,539
I actually was there when he drew it. I told him it looked like shit, but

104
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:33,079
he didn't want to correct it. I told him it should look more like a

105
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:37,160
Jackson Pollock painting than anything else, but he didn't want to listen.

106
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:41,000
What a weird, what a fucking idiot. You know what I mean? But you,

107
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:49,420
you could do a much. Hey, what's up? I'm trying to help you here. If you have run

108
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,299
to the chin, we're supposed to be doing this Coke right now and you are going to

109
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:57,160
rip the phone out of my hand. That's unbelievable. My fucking birthday, man.

110
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:09,109
Anyway, I have to, you know, if you want to go on a date with me, and how's the time to say it?

111
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:20,920
The body, mother of Christ compels us. Remember when we were kids, I've got your shoes.

112
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:39,940
Give me my shoes back. No, they're mine. Oh, I gotta help someone. Hold on.

113
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:52,150
I gotta help someone. Hold on. Hey. All right. Yeah, those shoes, they were expensive,

114
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,869
very expensive. And I'm glad that you came over there and screamed at them,

115
00:21:54,869 --> 00:22:01,829
but it didn't really help that much. Oh, I just broke my finger. Oh, it's all right.

116
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:33,049
These motherfuckers are strong. Yeah. Yeah. To you, to us. I'll meet you outside. Five

117
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:55,700
million. This is way harder. This is hard. Have a look. What do you think?

118
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,609
I was thinking of sending it to her. You know, okay, sure. If I wanted to see her,

119
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:08,059
see her kids again, you know, what do you think? Is it too much? Yeah, I think it might be.

120
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:19,059
Took me a long time to make it though. I am the business of ransom. It's just,

121
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:30,759
you know, not easy. Maybe you could go there and convince them. Yeah. Well, you,

122
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:33,400
you don't have the superpowers. I don't have any superpowers. Come on.

123
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:37,079
I just wanted to make a couple extra dollars, make some more millions.

124
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:44,089
Press one for refund. Play for one hour and then refund.

125
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:57,509
Oh, I wish I had like other items here. How long do they get to hold it here before

126
00:23:57,509 --> 00:24:03,269
I burn my hand? I'm going to say probably 10 seconds. And that's why I say,

127
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,549
I burnt my hand already. Were you thinking about something?

128
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,140
I just can't even imagine, you know, it's really, let me tell you something,

129
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:17,299
you know, it really pisses me off lately. The whole, it's, I mean, it's not even Thanksgiving

130
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:27,849
and I mean, I see, I see. Hold on. Words with friends just popped up. I am the pretty much

131
00:24:27,849 --> 00:24:31,450
number one in the region of words with friends. So sorry, I'm going to take an extra minute

132
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:44,900
here. Christmas decorations. You know what I'm saying? I want to punch them. I'd love,

133
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:49,319
I'd love to punch a Christmas decoration in the face. You know what I'm saying? Like

134
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:56,970
right in the face. Oh, with a shovel or a rock. Not even Thanksgiving yet.

135
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:10,359
Like, you know, a rope maybe. Sprangle. Yeah. You and me. We're going to go vandalize

136
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:29,380
Christmas decoration. Why is this? Oh, King's words. I want you to imagine this. If this,

137
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:44,630
if there wasn't a dub here. It's a five minute silent cut scene. What does it want me to do?

138
00:25:45,589 --> 00:25:52,250
I have, oh, go over to the flowers. Am I going to eat them? Is this actually supposed

139
00:25:52,250 --> 00:26:03,160
to be muted? Yeah. What is this? Turn up the volume. There is no volume. That's like the

140
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:10,230
point of the whole game. There is no sound. I don't, it's not that I have the volume

141
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:18,680
turned down. There is no volume. Turn on subtitles. They're already on, but there's a splash screen

142
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,599
at the beginning of the game that says, hey, subtitles are on, but you're not going to see

143
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:29,109
them unless it's in a specific situation where you can actually hear them. Wow. The iPhone sure

144
00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:35,269
did get fucking good. That was the best photo I think I've ever seen. That's like iPhone

145
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:48,150
16. Again, I'm going to reiterate this point one more time. Go to a stock footage site and

146
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:56,920
type in like woman smiling in bed or makeup commercial or toothpaste commercial.

147
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:18,170
One of those three will do. I was, I was specifically told before the stream started,

148
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:28,549
do not play this game. It's not funny. It's just, it's just not even good. But I,

149
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:41,140
well, we can, we're going over for free. What if I just don't move?

150
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:50,339
All right. Those are the moves you make when your cat's going crazy and you're like a

151
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:57,029
afraid of what it's going to do next. That's somebody that there's like a, there's a cat or

152
00:27:57,029 --> 00:28:07,819
a dog in the room and they're like, oh, oh, hold on. Those are the moves you made during

153
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:23,130
the green screen. Well, you guys know what to do. Hey, you got to pay for that. Grab,

154
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:31,049
throw. That was a pretty nice knee. This won the golden joystick award over red dead.

155
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:43,910
No, it did not. It did not. I'm sorry to say it's the same two moves.

156
00:28:46,299 --> 00:29:07,619
What? You got back up. Why is he getting back up? Oh, now he has a saw. Oh wait,

157
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:54,440
I thought this was still in the subway. I'm not dubbing this scene. Okay. Lazy streamer. No,

158
00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:08,180
I can't. Lame. What? Are you serious? Are you serious? Well, I get to be the only person

159
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:16,579
that's ever beaten this game on stream. Do you think that's a 100% guarantee? Maybe I'll

160
00:30:16,579 --> 00:30:31,480
get invited to Square Enix's next launch party. That was pretty nice. Dude, this is just a

161
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:37,000
wrestling game. He's gotten four sweet chin musics in a row. He should be done. No,

162
00:30:37,000 --> 00:31:02,309
he has a knife. Can I pick up the machete? What? Just now all of a sudden you can block.

163
00:31:02,869 --> 00:31:16,700
These are identical to my green screen kicks. The boss, this is a boss, isn't it?

164
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:30,069
Now we got to wait for the train. Skip to the next game. It's only been 30. I

165
00:31:30,069 --> 00:31:40,089
feel like I've been here for two hours. It's been 30 minutes. No, no, this is lame. No.

166
00:31:41,609 --> 00:32:49,029
Get off me. Yeah. My son, I think. I can't do a dog. Hold on. Yes, I can.

167
00:32:55,059 --> 00:33:31,700
I can't do a dog. Hello. My phone just actually rang. She's calling me. You had

168
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:42,099
that ready? I swear to God. No, I just got a phone call right now. I did not have that ready,

169
00:33:59,349 --> 00:34:32,099
but you told me to freeze. Was it a dead bird? This is not CG. This is, instead of FMV dad,

170
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:44,139
this is CG dad. Right this way? Hey, thanks. Yeah, you can close it. Nervous. I'm so

171
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:51,139
nervous about this. I mean, we had our troubles, but it's worth a shot to see.

172
00:35:09,659 --> 00:35:26,550
Funny you to show up. Well, got the flowers. Oh, I forgot you're allergic. Sorry. You want?

173
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:38,380
Hey, shut up. You just look handsome and light here. Do I? Maybe we could potentially

174
00:35:39,179 --> 00:36:03,349
work things out tonight. It's hard. Oh, uh, you know, I tough to come out here like this

175
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:15,420
and try to, you know what I'm saying? I know what you're saying. Hey, uh, hold on. Will you?

176
00:36:17,929 --> 00:36:21,829
No, he's already school. He's with me. I don't know who the fuck this guy is.

177
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:35,500
Just thinks you're gonna walk in here. Hey, uh, sorry. Um, fuck are you doing? You know,

178
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:39,340
I'm trying to fucking fix this here to get that fucking out of here. You brought a dead bird.

179
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:52,570
What do you bring a dead bird over to me and my ex? Fucking idiot. Don't look. I know we play

180
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:58,699
the pretend detective game together and we try to find the criminals, but this is not the

181
00:36:58,699 --> 00:37:11,030
time of the place, dude. Go home. Call mom. Okay, uh, we're back here. He just got lost.

182
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:16,070
This guy, I don't really know him. He got lost. But, um, anyways, so dinner tomorrow night,

183
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:24,500
potentially, if you, if you could have me. Hey, what the, why did you just do that? Oh,

184
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:35,130
no, no, you can't get. So, uh, I get how my, my little brother is going to come with

185
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:48,460
us. And, um, that's ain't fucking awkward at all. Is it? Your little brother sucks.

186
00:37:49,179 --> 00:38:00,619
Just be easy on him. He's kind of a weirdo. He's a dead bird in the car. It just might

187
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:03,340
stink a little bit. It probably smells like a dead animal, but just,

188
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,500
he's a little weird. Just let him, let him be.

189
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:24,820
He went from potential boyfriend to little brother. Mike is muted.

190
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:39,780
So, um, can I see the bird? I love birds. Is it a sparrow or maybe a chickadee or something

191
00:38:39,780 --> 00:39:06,329
like that? You don't have to be shy. I was going to say it's a blue Jay. Please voice

192
00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:20,840
the main character. Please stop playing this. I can't, I can't. Do you understand? Hey,

193
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:37,849
let's try something here. I mean, I need to compose myself. Hold on. You know, I,

194
00:39:37,849 --> 00:39:55,110
I like to collect birds. This is not good. I know I'm trying. You decide if you want to

195
00:39:55,110 --> 00:40:15,369
play this crap or not. All right. The achievement I just got is called Stargazer

196
00:40:15,449 --> 00:40:24,570
storm chaser. Everyone's just going on dates. Sorry. Club normies.

197
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:53,670
Welcome to club normies. Come on in. This is where the joke's so good. You made it twice.

198
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:58,489
No, I have this too many people here. I can't, I can't keep this up with like a hundred

199
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:10,550
people. This wine's delicious. Oh, that's a good Scott.

200
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:30,170
Important. This is really important. I don't fucking care. It is important.

201
00:41:30,969 --> 00:41:35,719
So you guys have to deal with this. I can't receive a phone call right now. This is too

202
00:41:35,719 --> 00:42:15,019
important. Okay, here we go. The song goes out to my, one of my closest friends in the

203
00:42:15,019 --> 00:43:11,579
audience right now, dedicated to them because they mean so much to me. Nice.

204
00:44:37,739 --> 00:44:53,699
It's time. Yeah. Oh, no, no, I'm not supposed to pull the fire on quick. Get like a

205
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:20,019
chair. Oh, wait. Hey, hey, hey. Oh, it's electric. That guy sneezed. No.

206
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:27,340
If you want to see her again and you'll be in trouble.

207
00:45:35,619 --> 00:45:36,099
Come here.

208
00:45:47,670 --> 00:46:15,639
Now there really is no sound. Did I break it? Make punching noises.

209
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:37,269
I need more sounds to do that. Um, is this guy going to go down?

210
00:46:41,769 --> 00:47:09,530
Oh, so, so long ago, the bird kid long. I've waited for this moment.

211
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:37,719
Maybe we'll see what you have boss fight boss fight. This is the

212
00:47:37,719 --> 00:48:00,820
flamest fucking boss fight I've ever seen. This guy sucks. No, no, no. Don't let him do it.

213
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:12,090
I'm just absolutely ratatatatting this guy's head. He's still going.

214
00:48:23,449 --> 00:48:30,309
You can't match my strength. You didn't even say that. Somebody dubbing over it did.

215
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:37,780
No, my sniper rod.

216
00:48:42,219 --> 00:49:29,289
No, don't. Yeah, that was my plan. Get. Oh, get me that car. Somebody call the police on

217
00:49:29,289 --> 00:49:36,780
that car. Somebody call the police. It's so unnecessary. You just did that for the cameras

218
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:47,619
that are obviously there. What's this? Oh, more fighting. Gas station. We're fighting

219
00:49:47,619 --> 00:50:11,559
in front of the gas station right now. Dodge. I feel like that's how I would dodge in a fight.

220
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:36,760
Nice. Broke his concentration. That was a pretty good combo over the car. Okay. Um, I

221
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:42,260
think like I really like people probably work hard on this. There's probably a lot of

222
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:47,139
talented people with talented coders and stuff. But if I'm the executive producer at Square Enix

223
00:50:48,019 --> 00:50:51,460
and you showed me that last, this last hole, maybe five minutes, 10 minutes here,

224
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:58,519
I'd probably be like, okay, yeah, that's uh, okay. And I would, I would turn around

225
00:50:58,519 --> 00:51:29,659
and I would do the bite my finger thing. Like, Oh fuck. Did I lose? That's a great

226
00:51:29,659 --> 00:51:35,900
thumbnail. That's a really good thumbnail. I told you I was a baby. Everybody talked shit.

227
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:40,539
What do you mean baby? Question marks, baby. I'm the baby there. And she's looking at me going,

228
00:51:40,539 --> 00:52:01,110
Oh, look, there's my little baby. The camera shaking so much. I mean, like the actual

229
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:11,610
full motion video scenes that look like a lot went into them. How old am I? This character?

230
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:18,250
Um, well, if I was a baby, then I don't know, like seven or eight years have gone by.

231
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:44,309
I'm probably nine. Nice. How, why, how would I have caught up with this car?

232
00:52:46,809 --> 00:52:53,829
That is like an extraordinary amount of non-damage. You get out of that car. For a second,

233
00:52:53,829 --> 00:53:00,219
I thought that guy was not going to notice I did that. Oh, come on. No, I want to run behind

234
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:09,579
the car. That guy was just doing laundry or something. What the fuck? We have to see this

235
00:53:09,579 --> 00:53:17,769
through. You understand? The game is apparently over in like an hour. I'm going to see this

236
00:53:17,769 --> 00:53:27,340
whole thing through. You don't, you really don't, but don't you want to know what happened?

237
00:53:28,139 --> 00:53:47,909
I need to know what happens. That's a pretty good strategy until I get fucking murdered.

238
00:53:57,139 --> 00:54:04,329
See, I'm very clearly lying on my back as a baby. Just wait until you see the diaper

239
00:54:04,329 --> 00:54:09,420
go into frame. She's going to hold up like a big poopy diaper and be like, Oh,

240
00:54:10,059 --> 00:54:40,730
I'm just going to spam. Who cares about actual inputs here? That was the hardest

241
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:45,829
punch I've ever seen. Why is the salad muffled? That's part of the game. It's part of the

242
00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:57,300
experience. I just lost again. I lost again. This guy punched me twice and I died. All right,

243
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:16,920
come on. Oh yeah. That's poopy. Nevermind. Just wait till it fucking happens, man.

244
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:23,130
You guys will say whatever you want to say now. All right. I'm not going to fucking

245
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:34,699
lose again. The game is on hard. Just remember that it's on hard. Why do I have this on hard?

246
00:55:34,699 --> 00:55:44,869
I'm already dead. I think, I think that guy's character, I think that guy's broken.

247
00:55:45,429 --> 00:56:01,239
That's the only guy. Why am I waiting for this? Why am I waiting for the diaper? It's

248
00:56:01,239 --> 00:56:06,360
not going to happen. It's not going to happen. All right. Who cares? Put it on like the

249
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:24,550
baby mode. The targeting doesn't make any sense either. It just randomly goes at a

250
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:33,670
sir. I can't like target anybody. Like the guy behind me. Like I can't, what am I supposed to do?

251
00:56:34,309 --> 00:56:52,789
Just press B? I mean you really feel like Batman. Ah, he's trying to sneak up on me.

252
00:56:53,349 --> 00:57:03,670
There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. I thought he was going to disappear.

253
00:57:04,389 --> 00:57:13,639
Yeah, come on. Of course. Wilds. See that took a lot of planning. That was, that was in

254
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:41,239
what? All right. Okay. Tyler Durden. No, don't hold on. Don't do it yet.

255
00:57:43,260 --> 00:58:01,849
Oh, here's the other group. Why do they become wild birds that just fly away? I don't understand.

256
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:17,559
Was this like the next tier up? Oh, it's my friends. Refund the game. Should I keep playing?

257
00:58:18,199 --> 00:58:21,880
No, no, man. I mean, really what you should do is just, this is the point of the story

258
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:26,280
where we're giving you a chance to refund. So if you want to just go ahead and you can

259
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:32,139
hit escape, right? No, no way, man. Hold on though. Hold on. Remember after two hours,

260
00:58:32,139 --> 00:58:40,300
it's not going to, I don't want to. I am going to keep playing this game until I finish it.

261
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:45,159
You understand? Dude. All right. Well, that was your last opportunity.

262
00:58:46,340 --> 00:59:00,460
Fuck it. Who cares? I'm going for the end. See you later. Oh, did you break that? That

263
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:15,539
was my fucking car. That's actually what he probably said. What's up next? Dump it.

264
00:59:27,619 --> 00:59:33,190
He bought. The game is three hours long. Well, we're 33% of the way through it.

265
00:59:43,639 --> 00:59:57,900
Stop, please. Two more hours. Hold on. Somebody confirmed that for me. Is this game

266
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:12,119
over? Okay. That was interesting. It's four hours. All right. Well, how about this?

267
01:00:13,219 --> 01:00:15,780
After it gets to the point where I can't refund the game anymore, I'll stop.

268
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,360
I mean, it's either this or we're going back to Hitman.

269
01:00:28,099 --> 01:00:36,889
Average is two hours and 40 minutes. I'll get it done. Hitman. Yeah, it's either this or Hitman

270
01:00:36,889 --> 01:00:42,579
because I want to play a couple of the other missions. I think I'm almost, I think it's over.

271
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:52,059
I went by so, I did it so quickly. Please God play this over Hitman.

272
01:00:52,059 --> 01:01:15,030
I don't know why part of me thinks this is funny. One guy said that. Yeah. Yeah. So what's,

273
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:21,719
what's the point? What's the point? Nobody said that. Yes, they did. Go look at the chat.

274
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:55,500
That's a Blavo keyboard. Don't you know, there's probably like two more piano scenes.

275
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:08,760
Break the keyboard. No, that Blavo keyboard was already grinded up in a meat grinder somewhere.

276
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:38,329
Now, whatever they do, I've recycled it. Low viewers, low donation, bad stream, not funny,

277
01:02:38,329 --> 01:02:50,170
still watching. Hey, hold on. Listen, that's all right. That's, that's all right. That's

278
01:02:50,170 --> 01:03:06,630
fine. Look, I'm going to, I'm going to beat this game. Come on. It's not all right. It's

279
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:15,619
not fine. Everyone has a bad stream now and again. Bad stream. I'm having a great time.

280
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:22,710
I'm having fun. I'm having a good time. I wonder how many times I have to say that

281
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:33,210
to myself before it becomes true. Okay. I am getting a little tired of just like the enemies

282
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:38,500
in the room. All right. All right. It's about to stop. I'm about to turn it off.

283
01:03:39,659 --> 01:03:43,099
All right. Hold on. I'm about to turn it off. I'm about to turn it off. Okay.

284
01:03:43,739 --> 01:04:07,610
I'm not going to refund it. Keep playing. It's like, I can't, I'm wedged inside of a giant vice

285
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:12,409
right now. And on one side of the, one of the wedges are people saying, continue to play.

286
01:04:12,409 --> 01:04:16,329
And the other wedge are people screaming at me to play something else. I'm going to get

287
01:04:16,329 --> 01:04:27,460
crushed. I'm going to get squished every 10 minutes. It gets closer. Like my hands are

288
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:31,219
up and the two wedges are coming in and I'm like, Oh shit, this is getting serious.

289
01:04:31,219 --> 01:04:58,139
Squish him. Somebody said fucking squish him. Squish him. Kill him.

290
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:16,300
Wait, what? Cut scene, fight scene, cut scene, fight scene, cut scene, fight scene.

291
01:05:20,869 --> 01:05:26,360
Make him into a puree. All right. We're going to do a poll. Okay.

292
01:05:27,159 --> 01:05:33,989
We will let democracy reign. I'm going to do a poll and we're going to see what you guys

293
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:55,500
want me to do. Okay. By the way, that poll is in 45 minutes. Oh, got a little closer.

294
01:05:56,139 --> 01:06:23,719
Crush it. Doing a poll later will reduce the range of votes.

295
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:49,340
I was getting a piano ready, but I don't think we need it. You guys didn't think it was mom.

296
01:06:49,340 --> 01:07:00,969
Look, terrible, terrible, terrible.

297
01:07:01,369 --> 01:07:16,659
Uh, we're about to get to the story climax. Come on. This is where we get to. Here's the big

298
01:07:16,659 --> 01:07:24,150
reveal. I hear you with my blood. Here we go. Big like story reveal. Who's the skeleton?

299
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:51,619
Why can I not hurt you? What's going on? What? This is just like, I feel like I'm

300
01:07:51,619 --> 01:07:58,139
just shooting me with a fucking gun. What the fuck was that? I just got taunt killed.

301
01:07:59,019 --> 01:08:29,289
I really, I honestly, ah, he's getting close. He's getting close. He's getting close to run away.

302
01:08:29,289 --> 01:08:38,729
Ah, damn it. I need to know who this is under there. I'm invested in the hour and 45 minutes

303
01:08:38,729 --> 01:08:57,260
story. All right. I just, I just kicked the shit out of you. You're going to do some combos

304
01:08:57,260 --> 01:09:03,050
and it's going to be the mom. It has to be right. And then I'll delete the game.

305
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:11,979
Well, all right. Here's a scenario. If it's mom under there, I delete the game and refund it.

306
01:09:12,699 --> 01:09:17,100
If it's me under there, if I take the mask off and it's my face and it's been me the whole time,

307
01:09:17,899 --> 01:09:27,100
then I play for another four hours. Okay. And I've just been beating my like self up in

308
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:48,500
my bedroom. We got our room with the mask. Take off that mask. Here it comes. Here comes a

309
01:09:48,500 --> 01:10:09,029
Scooby Doo reveal. How did we turn just from here to where did the bird go? What? Where did

310
01:10:09,029 --> 01:10:32,630
the bird go? Delete game. No, that wasn't one of the options. Please delete game. No,

311
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:42,869
I'm going to write an entire review. I'm going to get hired by IGN. I'm going to write a

312
01:10:42,869 --> 01:10:49,689
review of this game because I need to complete it. And then I'm going to put my two weeks

313
01:10:49,689 --> 01:11:25,479
notice in it. Okay. So now this isn't wirehead. I thought it was going to be a game like that

314
01:11:25,479 --> 01:11:34,789
from the trailer. It looked like it was going to be a FMV kind of game. I was misled by the

315
01:11:34,789 --> 01:11:49,510
trailer. Next time I die, I have to make a poll. Okay. That's fair. Why did you choose this

316
01:11:49,510 --> 01:12:01,319
game? I don't know because we've had fun with FMV games before. I thought this could have been

317
01:12:01,319 --> 01:12:08,859
another one, but it's just walk from room to room and fight enemy. And then, and they've

318
01:12:08,859 --> 01:12:16,819
also paused. This is the same room I was in before. Did the game reset? I'm confused here.

319
01:12:16,819 --> 01:12:27,189
This is the same room I was in. The game didn't reset, did it? Did I lose my save file?

320
01:12:27,189 --> 01:13:07,859
It's the same room, same TV. Didn't the same thing happen? What? The police are here now.

321
01:13:07,859 --> 01:13:21,109
Everybody freeze. Where there was a disturbance. I've been able to open all these doors.

322
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:41,689
This is a disturbance. This is the police. Put your hands up. Put a poll in chat.

323
01:13:41,689 --> 01:13:44,489
Here's what I don't get about this. I understand the whole, well, there's no sound

324
01:13:44,489 --> 01:13:50,100
because the main character is hearing impaired, right? But he's, he's not here right now.

325
01:13:50,100 --> 01:14:07,819
He's not currently here. I mean, he's over here. Why couldn't we just hear that? Ah, the old two

326
01:14:07,819 --> 01:14:14,420
people holding a guy pretending to struggle bit and they're just barely putting their hands on

327
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:28,460
him. Yeah, get in there. Oh, this is so tough. He's wild. Oh, all right. Oh, I got a,

328
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:44,170
I got a wild one here too. Oh, that was hard. If I'm a director, I'm gonna be like,

329
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:47,369
I'm gonna go like, I'm gonna take, you know, the actors to the side and be like,

330
01:14:47,369 --> 01:14:55,619
hey, listen, like you, like you can bite that guy for real and like try to bite him. And you

331
01:14:55,619 --> 01:15:21,939
want like really want, I would be, I would, I would direct my actors. I don't understand what,

332
01:15:22,739 --> 01:15:27,909
this is like the main selling point of the game is we just didn't add an audio track.

333
01:15:33,859 --> 01:15:51,399
That's, that's the only thing that's, that's it. And you want to play it. I don't

334
01:15:51,399 --> 01:15:59,750
want to play it, but, but we see things through on this channel, maybe like 30 or 40% of the time,

335
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:04,310
like, but we, we see three, we see things through on this channel, maybe like three

336
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:17,989
out of 10 times. So, sorry, I just kind of had to piss back here, but sorry, I startled you.

337
01:16:18,550 --> 01:16:27,689
He'll finish this, but not LA D'more. LA D'more is like 60 hours. This is three.

338
01:16:28,329 --> 01:16:52,180
This is punishment for the dab. I can't tell. Is this CG? No, this is, this is real,

339
01:16:52,180 --> 01:17:01,930
right? Yeah. Okay. This is real. All right. We're almost ready for the pole. If he breaks the lamp,

340
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:13,850
I'll give a pull. Throw the lamp across the room and you get a pull. Uh, one of these tropes is

341
01:17:13,850 --> 01:17:19,289
going to happen. He's going to notice something ridiculous. Turn around, grab, throw, shatter

342
01:17:19,289 --> 01:17:27,300
against the wall. Then you get your pull. Wait, what did I say? If it was me, if it was me

343
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:51,289
doing this, that I had to finish it, right? Oh no. I did it. So I have to finish it.

344
01:17:55,460 --> 01:19:06,100
Oh, he screams again. I'm remembering everything that happened. I broke that guy's arm.

345
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:15,380
I smashed a bottle. I got yelled at. I made direct awkward eye contact with another actor on

346
01:19:15,939 --> 01:19:36,390
him. What am I done? What the hell are you doing? He's the bird. He's the bird. I have to beat the

347
01:19:36,390 --> 01:19:50,140
game. He's the bird. I knew it. Yep. He's the bird. Okay. Well, no pole. Oh, it's over guys.

348
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:56,329
All right. No. Okay. All right. Here. Let me like, let me go back and like

349
01:19:57,449 --> 01:20:13,380
rewrite this rule. That was just a dream. That might not be real. All right. If it was

350
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:29,850
just a dream, then rules are rules. See, it's okay. It was just a dream. That wasn't actually

351
01:20:29,850 --> 01:20:34,180
real. Just because it was on camera doesn't mean it was real. Still get your pull.

352
01:20:46,069 --> 01:20:56,649
Dream rules don't count. That's yeah, that's real. That's true. No, that's fine. Just because

353
01:20:56,649 --> 01:21:05,189
it showed up in the game doesn't mean it actually happened. Face on. What do you mean

354
01:21:05,189 --> 01:21:16,149
face on? Did he throw that out the window? Those are expensive. All of his personal data

355
01:21:16,149 --> 01:21:39,130
is on there. He's punching the driver's seat. Yeah. He's going to fuck up his driver.

356
01:21:56,470 --> 01:22:03,260
How long has it been? Have I been streaming for like five hours? No, not even two hours. Not

357
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:16,890
even an hour and a half. I feel like I'm sitting in this chair for a month. The game

358
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:28,569
actually has no sound. Oh yeah. That's not my configuration being wrong. You have 40 minutes

359
01:22:28,569 --> 01:22:46,460
left to refund this. No, I want to be one of their only sales. What's the story again?

360
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:54,250
Good luck. I have no idea. Something about a guy. His mom was killed when he was younger

361
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:59,449
and it might have just been him that did it. And now he's, I don't know. I have no idea

362
01:22:59,449 --> 01:23:06,619
what's happening because we weren't able to see. I can't, there's no subtitles and you

363
01:23:06,619 --> 01:23:12,409
can't hear anything. So we're just supposed to be led to believe his dad is a cop. His dad

364
01:23:12,409 --> 01:23:19,699
may have killed the mother and I have a friend that they got the sneakers stolen

365
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:44,500
by this guy. And then this guy went to jail and then, and then this, I don't know. Why would

366
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:50,119
you want to be one of the idiots that bought this and didn't refund it? I don't know. Part of

367
01:23:50,119 --> 01:24:00,069
me thinks that's funny. I kind of think that's funny. Is it? It might be. I could, I could

368
01:24:00,069 --> 01:24:10,550
look at my Steam library and be like, oh yeah, I remember that. This isn't $30. This is 15.

369
01:24:19,399 --> 01:24:30,779
He's running away. Okay. It's not worth it. Well, I got, I have up until,

370
01:24:36,729 --> 01:24:41,819
why would you want to remember that you played this for the Steam trading cards? Yeah. You'll

371
01:24:41,819 --> 01:24:51,350
see in like five years, this will be worth like at least one or two Hearthstone packs.

372
01:24:51,350 --> 01:25:03,529
You know what I mean? Trading the Quiet Man two main character cards for two refined metal.

373
01:25:03,529 --> 01:25:13,609
No, that's going to be worth a lot of fucking money. Quiet Man was critically panned. What,

374
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:36,600
what are you guys doing with the complaints? Uh oh. Uh oh. They're copy pasting a review of

375
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:43,510
the game. This game is 39 gigs. Holy shit. It was, I was wondering why it took so long to

376
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:54,779
download. Why? Why is this game 40 gigs? What? Is it because of all the, the cut scenes? No

377
01:25:54,779 --> 01:26:03,670
way. Yeah, it did take a long time to download. That's true. It has uncompressed audio. Come on

378
01:26:03,670 --> 01:26:17,859
H.264, man. You ever like, I know this is, I'm speaking at it like total like arm chair here,

379
01:26:17,859 --> 01:26:22,579
like arm chair dev. Like, you know, it's the Viad. But sometimes I really do think if I had

380
01:26:22,579 --> 01:26:27,720
like $10 million or like $5 million, I think I could probably actually put a team together and

381
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:31,560
make something pretty good. I don't, maybe that's just me being an idiot and like lying.

382
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:43,779
I don't know. You ever, sometimes you feel that way? Everyone, everyone thinks that. Yeah,

383
01:26:43,779 --> 01:26:50,539
I know. But like, sometimes I think it's real, but it's not because that's speaking from total

384
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:55,020
ignorance. If I had $5 million, I had to make a fun game. It's like, oh, would you? No,

385
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:57,739
I'd come up with, I would make, this is what I would make that. But that would, at least

386
01:26:57,739 --> 01:27:06,789
I would put that in the game and I'd be proud of the spinning roundhouse kick. But then

387
01:27:06,789 --> 01:27:10,310
you have to like bring yourself back to reality and be like, I, uh, I have no idea

388
01:27:10,310 --> 01:27:14,090
what the fuck I'm doing. And there's no way it would be even remotely close to probably

389
01:27:14,170 --> 01:27:18,329
as good as this game. Technically, like I would, it would be like a stick figure game,

390
01:27:18,329 --> 01:27:24,170
but I would hire people. I bring in very talented people and I would, I would just

391
01:27:24,170 --> 01:27:29,850
sit in a giant chair that oversaw the whole development team. And I'd have a big horn,

392
01:27:29,850 --> 01:27:35,239
like a big bullhorn. And I'd be like, you're doing a good job down there.

393
01:27:36,390 --> 01:27:52,890
You over at programming, excellent work. Like I would look over, I would see on the other

394
01:27:52,890 --> 01:27:57,609
side, they'd be the, you know, the, the grass, the grass people, the grass team. Yeah,

395
01:27:57,609 --> 01:28:07,220
I'd have a dedicated team of grass. You know, I took a tackle. Did I lose? No, I'm still alive.

396
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:14,260
Like the grass looks good over there. Good work. Maybe 2% longer blades.

397
01:28:14,979 --> 01:28:22,699
And people would love me as their boss. Yeah, I would be so, I would be such a good boss.

398
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:31,859
I would throw parties. Like I would invite clowns to be birthday parties and I would

399
01:28:31,859 --> 01:28:48,170
always have like fresh muffins and cookies for everybody. Oh, I died. Shit. And anytime

400
01:28:48,170 --> 01:28:50,810
there was something I didn't like that was happening in the studio. Like if I looked over

401
01:28:50,810 --> 01:28:57,529
at the team of, of, of grass blade designers and I was like, oh, that didn't look that good. I'd

402
01:28:57,529 --> 01:29:04,729
be like, you're doing your best and I appreciate it. Take the next three days off. And then I

403
01:29:04,729 --> 01:29:08,090
would just like get down off my giant chair and I'd sit at the computer and try to do it.

404
01:29:08,090 --> 01:29:26,069
All right. Here's a fucking pole. Next three days off is fired. No, it's not. That's go

405
01:29:26,069 --> 01:29:33,189
take a break and come back fresh. I would have fresh sandwiches every day. I would go,

406
01:29:33,189 --> 01:29:38,119
I would go person to person, like seat to seat. And I would take a, Hey, what's your favorite?

407
01:29:38,119 --> 01:29:43,739
What's your favorite sandwich? No, actually, uh, I really like a tomato basil mozzarella.

408
01:29:43,739 --> 01:29:47,180
Is that like weird? No, no, no, that's fine. You're going to have it every day.

409
01:29:47,180 --> 01:30:04,739
Okay. Hold on. Uh, finish this game. Come back fresh or don't come back at all. That's not

410
01:30:04,739 --> 01:30:22,359
what I said. That's not what I said. All right. Here's your pole. I died. Take a look.

411
01:30:22,359 --> 01:30:38,859
There you go. Come back. So you can design grass. Yeah. They would, they would be,

412
01:30:38,859 --> 01:30:44,949
there'd be 2000 people on the dev team. And by this point I would have had,

413
01:30:44,949 --> 01:30:48,069
I would have already been making, you know, I mean, my Twitch career is,

414
01:30:48,069 --> 01:30:51,270
I mean, doing real good. So I'm saying probably another year or two, I'll have like

415
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:56,229
six or $700 million in the bank account. So I would just, I would have 2000 employees

416
01:30:56,869 --> 01:31:01,189
each. There would be 10 employees dedicated to grass, 10 employees dedicated to the sky,

417
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:05,029
10 employees dedicated to food items that like modeling food items to put around.

418
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:28,550
New game plus has sound. This is difficult. Look at this split here. Fucking sandwiches.

419
01:31:29,189 --> 01:31:32,619
Oh, the boss, like that, you have to scream at me though, because I'm,

420
01:31:32,619 --> 01:31:36,859
I'm so high up in the, I'm in like a huge chair with a horn like boss.

421
01:31:37,819 --> 01:31:43,420
Yeah. Tim, what is it? Tim valued employee, Tim, how are you? What can I get for you?

422
01:31:43,739 --> 01:31:52,600
Hey, uh, can I have a lasagna? Absolutely. And I would fucking call like the nearest lasagna

423
01:31:52,600 --> 01:32:02,979
company and would get it catered for him. Uh, it looks like, okay, whoa, this is still close.

424
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:23,289
Bankrupt in a week. And if somebody had a problem with like me or the company, I'd,

425
01:32:23,289 --> 01:32:30,409
I would get off the chair and I'd be like, all right, uh, uh, Mike Davidson.

426
01:32:30,970 --> 01:32:34,729
I, I know you've had it. You have a problem with something here. I, it's, I want you,

427
01:32:34,729 --> 01:32:38,329
you, you get a day in the big chair. Then he gets to go up there and like sit up there

428
01:32:38,329 --> 01:32:53,880
and like yell down about lasagnas to people and shit for 10 minutes. No, no, no, 10 minutes.

429
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:57,260
And then when he comes down, we've been like high five and they're like,

430
01:32:57,260 --> 01:33:03,260
I would shake his hand and they'd be like $400. Like just 400 just in that handshake.

431
01:33:07,109 --> 01:33:16,810
All right. I, I'm going to close this in like 60 seconds because this is so,

432
01:33:16,810 --> 01:33:20,250
this is too close, but I'm going to close it because it has to happen.

433
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:38,760
This is the longest 60 seconds of my life. And the people that are making the grass,

434
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:45,939
let's bring this last point up before I close the poll. You know, uh, uh, Mr. Albertson.

435
01:33:45,939 --> 01:33:50,659
Yeah, yes. Uh, I don't, I don't, I'm trying to get a feel for, I never like made grass

436
01:33:50,659 --> 01:33:54,739
before. I've never really, I came from like a different team and I'd be like, absolutely.

437
01:33:55,619 --> 01:33:59,699
Hold on a minute. I'd come down and I, we would eat grass together. I'd be like,

438
01:33:59,699 --> 01:34:04,260
you want to try some? And like, we would eat it. I would eat it mostly. Uh, I'm a big, I love it.

439
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:08,180
So I would be, I would eat the grass in front of them and I would explain exactly how it tasted.

440
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:12,420
And I would be like, if you want to try, go for it. And I've given them microscopes.

441
01:34:12,420 --> 01:34:15,960
They ever more, every single desk would have a microscope by the way.

442
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:18,840
So in case there was something you need more detail on, look through the

443
01:34:19,479 --> 01:34:23,319
microscope for the blade grass. If you want to eat it, it'd be fine. Um,

444
01:34:28,869 --> 01:34:34,630
all right. The poll is closed. I'm done. I'm out. Poll is closed. That's it. Nah,

445
01:34:34,630 --> 01:34:46,890
it's over. By the way, guys, this is a telltale game. Choices don't matter.

446
01:34:47,770 --> 01:35:13,859
I can't believe this got voted off. I can't believe it. What the hell? Everyone that said,

447
01:35:13,859 --> 01:35:20,420
yes, keep playing. Fuck chat. No, I, uh, I can't do that. No, just one more guy,

448
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:24,550
one more enemy. Look, I told you I was going to stop. I didn't tell you when,

449
01:35:25,270 --> 01:35:36,779
in like a minute. I would, okay. Can I play this like in the corner while we figure out

450
01:35:36,779 --> 01:35:50,520
what else we're going to do? Like I may not have done what you wanted here,

451
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:53,720
but it's anybody down here wanted a lasagna. Anybody want a lasagna?

452
01:35:54,680 --> 01:36:06,659
I'm willing to call. I'll get one. Me, me. What if everybody wants a lasagna? Well,

453
01:36:06,659 --> 01:36:11,529
then I'm going to get a big lasagna. I'll get a big kiddie pool and they'll put it,

454
01:36:11,529 --> 01:36:15,689
they'll just make a giant lasagna in the kiddie pool. It'll be lasagna day

455
01:36:15,689 --> 01:36:18,329
and I'll jump in it and like roll around in it with like swimmies on.

456
01:36:27,989 --> 01:36:33,109
All right. I'm leaving. I'm gone. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm almost gone.

457
01:36:33,109 --> 01:36:41,449
Damn it. Hold on. Let me open up. I was going to,

458
01:36:41,449 --> 01:36:43,770
I'm going to plan a couple of hitman missions that we have didn't do.

459
01:36:44,649 --> 01:37:12,420
And this is going to take a second. I'm not going to break my computer.

460
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:33,579
If I crashed my computer, I'm going to be so sad. All right. Here it comes.

461
01:37:33,579 --> 01:37:40,390
Let's get another game capture on here. What the fuck? The controller. I don't want rumble.

462
01:37:41,029 --> 01:37:48,659
Nobody wants rumble. Nobody. This was a gimmick back in like the Nintendo 64 era.

463
01:37:51,180 --> 01:37:57,880
Does anybody get immersed with rumble at this point? The controller shakes. That was cool.

464
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:11,699
Back in 2002. I mean, I like it. It's fun. Sometimes. Don't you wish food had a rumble

465
01:38:11,699 --> 01:38:14,420
feature? So when you eat lasagna, it would like rumble to going down.

466
01:38:38,409 --> 01:38:40,970
This is impossible. So I'm just going to delete.
