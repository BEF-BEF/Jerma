1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,339
Just open up the first one instead.

2
00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:05,339
You want to just play the first one?

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,960
Let's open up the first one. I like that one.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:27,350
Relaxing stream.

5
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,350
I got a meeting in like an hour and ten minutes.

6
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:39,590
I went backwards.

7
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,590
I've depreciated.

8
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:48,310
Remember this one? Remember this game?

9
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,679
I gotta change the stream title.

10
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:56,500
So what the fuck are they gonna add in the third game?

11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,829
Is it gonna come with a cook serve delicious eye patch that you have to wear?

12
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:13,420
Is the game mirrored? Do I have to like hold a mirror up behind me and play it?

13
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,019
Third game's a food truck.

14
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:20,019
That's actually pretty cool. Alright, let's go.

15
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:22,579
I know it. Okay, look at this one.

16
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:25,780
Day 15.

17
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,780
We're gonna go day 4. Yeah.

18
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,780
Because I'm not ready.

19
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,659
I'm gonna embarrass myself again, I think.

20
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,030
Career menu, let's go.

21
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,030
We got patch notes. Alright, cool.

22
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:42,920
Start new day.

23
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:54,250
I need to know if I still have it in me.

24
00:01:54,250 --> 00:02:04,870
Nice.

25
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:16,330
You nailed it.

26
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:23,110
You lost 2,000 viewers. No, I didn't.

27
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,849
That would be so...

28
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:29,849
That would be so sad if I did.

29
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:34,389
I would be sad.

30
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:38,389
I'd be like, oh fuck, I couldn't do cook serve delicious and everybody left.

31
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:40,569
I couldn't play this second game.

32
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:44,280
Oh, you said no salt, right?

33
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:50,039
This is fried chicken.

34
00:02:50,039 --> 00:03:01,539
Got it.

35
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:03,539
This is the kind of rush hour I'm talking about.

36
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:05,539
Cook serve delicious 2 is this one with mods.

37
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:21,530
Ah.

38
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,530
This is casual. Yeah, this is relaxing though, isn't it?

39
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,530
That's what I wanted.

40
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:36,599
I quit the second one because it was too hard for me.

41
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,599
But I am playing this one and I like this one.

42
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:40,599
You're never gonna make it in the McDonald's industry.

43
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:48,150
I don't need to.

44
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,150
Make it in my own chicken industry.

45
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,900
Come on.

46
00:03:52,900 --> 00:04:00,629
With salt.

47
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:11,300
Warm up with the first one then move on to the second one.

48
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,300
No, I can't do it.

49
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,300
You know what's funny?

50
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:22,019
The second that I realized that I was gonna have to like hold buttons and press all the buttons at the same time.

51
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,019
I was like, well, this is the streams end.

52
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:26,519
This is over.

53
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:28,519
I didn't want to say it.

54
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,519
I knew it.

55
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:33,339
I knew it.

56
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,959
I can't. I knew it.

57
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:38,709
Shift tab and then hold

58
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:40,709
left trigger and press like.

59
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:51,720
Nope. I pressed S.

60
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,620
You played it for less than 10 minutes.

61
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,459
Yeah, and I wanted

62
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:01,459
just to relax today.

63
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:03,459
Just chill and draw pictures

64
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:17,670
of cartoons and stuff.

65
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,670
Play it again sometime. Maybe I'll try it again.

66
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,670
I don't know. I just like.

67
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,670
And I know it's not the game's fault. That's the thing.

68
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:37,990
It's me. No me.

69
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,019
That was some straight up Neo treatment.

70
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:48,040
Yeah, but I didn't like.

71
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,040
I can tell you that I didn't like Neo.

72
00:05:50,040 --> 00:06:06,660
Uh oh. Here we go.

73
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,660
Uh oh. I was supposed to hit three. Come on.

74
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,660
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

75
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:24,410
Oh, shit. Alright, we're good.

76
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:39,300
Shit. I missed it.

77
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,379
I missed it twice in a row.

78
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:44,379
You should play Tapper. Is that the beer game?

79
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:54,040
I'm ahead on that beer.

80
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:59,420
Am I losing my mind?

81
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,420
Or is this day going on

82
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,660
an extreme

83
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,660
amount of time? Why is this so long?

84
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,660
Am I missing something here?

85
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:12,839
Why is this going on for so long?

86
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:21,420
Is it just a slower game?

87
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,360
Or is this endless mode?

88
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:36,329
Give a picture. Thumbs up.

89
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:39,269
Alright, I'm going to switch to day 15 after this

90
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:41,269
because that's the way we were last time, I think.

91
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:45,750
I think I just need to warm up.

92
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,750
In fact, yeah. Get me out of here. I quit.

93
00:07:47,750 --> 00:08:02,389
There it is. Select a character.

94
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:04,389
What? I don't remember any of this.

95
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:06,389
Welcome to Battle Kitchen?

96
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:11,189
No. There we go.

97
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:15,480
Alright. So the last time I played this,

98
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:20,540
this is where we left off. Burgers are now

99
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,709
available. Menu rot.

100
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:24,709
I got to take that shit off the menu. Safety inspection.

101
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:26,709
It's time for your five day safety inspection.

102
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:28,709
Inspector will come to your restaurant a few times today.

103
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:31,779
How quickly I do chores.

104
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:34,220
Alright, that's good to know.

105
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,289
What do I have for foods right now?

106
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:40,039
Good shit. Here's my menu. There's rot

107
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,470
here. Rotten.

108
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,470
Disgusting. It's fucking rotten.

109
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:49,379
Let's put the steak.

110
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:51,750
The trout. Lasagna.

111
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,750
Ooh, this might be bad.

112
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:59,450
I don't know about that.

113
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,450
I said the word lasagna and everyone's saying disgusting.

114
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,259
I agree. Okay, that's fine.

115
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:07,139
What do I have for money? No.

116
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:14,700
Let's go. I'm kidding. Lasagna's

117
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,259
not disgusting. Hello?

118
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:23,509
What's going on? One.

119
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:26,710
One. Hey!

120
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:37,509
Hey! What is going on?

121
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:51,259
Begin. What happened?

122
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:53,259
Okay, something's wrong. The game, like, is broken.

123
00:09:53,259 --> 00:10:03,159
Uh, is num

124
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:05,980
numlock?

125
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,110
Is it recognizing the...

126
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,289
Okay, unplug the controller.

127
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:17,429
Press alt.

128
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:25,429
I need to restart the game.

129
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:35,019
Well, that sucks.

130
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:37,019
I mean, I'm still relaxed. Everything's fine.

131
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,019
What time is it? I got my meeting.

132
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:41,019
I've got my meeting in, like, 45 minutes.

133
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:43,509
An hour. It's an important meeting.

134
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:51,700
Munkas.

135
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,700
Why are you munkasing that?

136
00:10:53,700 --> 00:11:00,360
Okay, here we go. Day 15.

137
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,350
Career menu.

138
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,360
View your active menu. This is...

139
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,360
That's fine.

140
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:19,509
Start the new day. There we go.

141
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:22,519
Game glitched. It's all good.

142
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:25,720
Don't play a bad game and

143
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,720
do a comb stream for an hour.

144
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,049
This is not a bad game.

145
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:33,929
Season three times in one juice.

146
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:42,500
For a second I thought the

147
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
kitchen exploded. I don't know why. I just heard the...

148
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,500
Okay, layer ingredients above.

149
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,500
Pasta, sauce, cheese, parmesan.

150
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,679
Oh, right.

151
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:58,220
And then this is ready?

152
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,250
A medium grape with ice, please.

153
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,809
With ice. A medium. I need a medium grape with ice.

154
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:06,809
Oh, ah!

155
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,809
Ah!

156
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:10,809
Where? Did I do it? Okay.

157
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:25,059
Uh...

158
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:27,059
I can't watch this stream. It's making me too hungry.

159
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:32,120
Large.

160
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,120
With no ice. Large cold with no ice. You got it.

161
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,120
Steak. Season once.

162
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,120
Twice juicy.

163
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,120
And a little bit of citrus.

164
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,360
And fillet the fish.

165
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,360
And then season it up. Cook it up.

166
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,360
What do we got? I want a small diet with ice, please.

167
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,360
How do I get ice? Ice. Small diet with ice, please.

168
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,360
Small diet with ice, please.

169
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,360
Four. Parmesan.

170
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,360
Pasta, sauce, meat, cheese, parmesan.

171
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,559
I don't know.

172
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:00,820
A small tea with ice, please.

173
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:11,129
Medium diet with ice, please.

174
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:17,659
Four. We got large cold with ice.

175
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:19,659
No ice, please.

176
00:13:19,659 --> 00:13:22,919
Okay. Pasta, sauce, meat, cheese.

177
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,919
Pasta, sauce, meat, cheese.

178
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:31,320
Right?

179
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:41,179
I don't know. I did it fast.

180
00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:43,799
See? Oh, you idiot.

181
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:50,460
Nice meat soup.

182
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:54,100
You have to go faster.

183
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,100
Pasta, sauce, meat, cheese, parmesan.

184
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,100
P. S. M.

185
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,100
P. S. M. S.

186
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,100
P. S. M. S.

187
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,730
I can't.

188
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,730
I can't. I'm not capable.

189
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,610
I'm incapable.

190
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:15,429
P. S. M. C. P.

191
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:18,059
I have to look at my fucking hands.

192
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:20,740
P. S. M. C. R.

193
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,740
P. S. M. C. R.

194
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,740
P. S. M. C. R.

195
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:43,690
You gotta play something relaxing.

196
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:53,929
I'm good. I'm good. Don't worry.

197
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:55,929
P. S. What was it?

198
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:58,809
P. S. M. C. R.

199
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:04,440
I don't know if that was correct.

200
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:19,590
That was right.

201
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,590
He's just sitting here sweating in a suit and playing a baby game

202
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,590
while stressing about his important

203
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,730
meeting.

204
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,730
I don't own a three piece suit.

205
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,990
Season one's twice juicy.

206
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:37,750
Season one's twice juicy.

207
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,570
P. S. M. C. R.

208
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:52,019
Large. Oops.

209
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,019
Throw it away. How do I throw it away?

210
00:15:54,019 --> 00:16:05,610
Whatever.

211
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,610
Season three times and one juicy.

212
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,610
P. S. P. S. M.

213
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,610
P. S. I. P. S.

214
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,610
P. S. C. R.

215
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:18,649
Oh! P. S.

216
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:28,889
Didn't fuck it up.

217
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:38,230
Oh. P. C. P. S. C. D. D. D.

218
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,230
Down. It's P. S. C. C. D. D. M. M.

219
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,840
The speed run of this is really fast.

220
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:50,539
That's actually pretty interesting to look at I think.

221
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:54,759
Okay. Chores.

222
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:59,179
The second a chore comes up, do a quick

223
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:15,029
two three. Why do you flush it

224
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:17,029
and sanitize the toilet? I don't know.

225
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:19,980
Why flush the toilet at all? It's a waste of water.

226
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,150
P. S.

227
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:28,099
Just fill it up for like weeks and then

228
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:30,099
flush it. That's disgusting.

229
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:54,299
Flush it once a month.

230
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:57,940
That's an outhouse.

231
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,940
Almost at two stars.

232
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,759
A new catering job's opened up. You can view the

233
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:04,759
challenge in the extra events menu. Good luck.

234
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:13,130
Catering event.

235
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:17,420
Burger pizza party.

236
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:24,329
Do I have it? I don't know. I don't have it.

237
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:26,329
I really do need to get a pizza.

238
00:18:26,329 --> 00:18:29,079
Sixteen hundred.

239
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:31,900
Fuck. No. I can't. I need to save money.

240
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,589
Back to the menu.

241
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:39,180
We're getting rot.

242
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,930
Should I do baked potato?

243
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,930
Put the burger back on the menu. It's more money.

244
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,930
I don't want the lasagna. Fuck the lasagna.

245
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:49,259
Get the steak off there. French fries.

246
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:51,259
We're a burger and fish restaurant now.

247
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:57,460
Anything else for the inspection passed?

248
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,460
Today's buzz increased by ten percent.

249
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:12,119
Let's go.

250
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,119
I'm a weirdo that hates steak.

251
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,119
I don't hate steak. I just don't order it.

252
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:18,119
Oh my god.

253
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:20,119
Medium diet. Just throw it away.

254
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:22,119
How do I toss this? Is there a toss this button?

255
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:32,619
No salt.

256
00:19:32,619 --> 00:19:39,190
Yeah.

257
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,190
No. I don't order steak. I don't like

258
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,190
steak. Really.

259
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,430
I like shaved steak.

260
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,670
But

261
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,670
it's not appetizing to me at all.

262
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,670
When somebody says

263
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,670
Oh hey man. Do you want a

264
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,670
medium rare steak?

265
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,670
I...no.

266
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:01,940
Absolutely not.

267
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,940
I'll eat like steak and cheese sub. I'll eat

268
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,940
like flank steak and stuff. I just don't

269
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:12,980
really like it. I like ketchup

270
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,980
on steak. I do not.

271
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,250
I don't know where you got that info.

272
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:26,380
What do you want? Meat, lettuce, bacon, cheese,

273
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,380
tomatoes. You want everything.

274
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:42,779
What do you want? Small water with ice.

275
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:45,980
With ice? Rats.

276
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,750
Drink small tea with ice.

277
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:56,579
A beer.

278
00:20:56,579 --> 00:20:59,019
A medium diet with ice.

279
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:01,019
What do you want? A medium cold with ice.

280
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:10,470
One patty.

281
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:14,059
Oh god. One patty.

282
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:16,059
Meat too. Lettuce,

283
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:18,059
bacon, cheese, tomato. Get it out of here.

284
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:20,680
Meat tomato.

285
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,240
Get it out of here. Meat

286
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,240
bacon, double cheese, and

287
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:31,000
tomato. Get it out of here. You want a triple

288
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,180
cheeseburger? Relax.

289
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:42,390
Holy shit. I

290
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:48,470
would not eat that. Triple cheeseburger

291
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:56,980
is too much. Double is perfect.

292
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,980
I don't know how unpopular or popular

293
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,980
this statement is going to be.

294
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,420
But I find

295
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,420
a hamburger patty that is more than

296
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,420
four ounces to be gross.

297
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:15,529
It's just me.

298
00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:17,529
I'll take a double. A double cheeseburger

299
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:19,529
with two four ounce patties.

300
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:21,529
I think that still works.

301
00:22:21,529 --> 00:22:29,140
I really don't like when people make these

302
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,140
big ass fucking gigantic

303
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,140
eight ounce hamburger

304
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,980
patties. There's a balance

305
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,980
there that is just you don't step over.

306
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:44,420
Yeah, no, I'll take an eight ounce

307
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,420
of meat as long as it's two four ounce patties.

308
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:52,950
Oops. Yeah, that's fine.

309
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,950
But when people do double patties in this

310
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,950
six to eight ounce patties, that's just, no.

311
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,950
That's too much. You can't do a double

312
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:03,369
once it's four ounces. I mean it.

313
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:11,819
What about

314
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:13,819
a two ounce patty and a six ounce

315
00:23:13,819 --> 00:23:16,309
patty? That would be weird.

316
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:18,309
That would be strange.

317
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:20,619
What about a single six ounce patty?

318
00:23:20,619 --> 00:23:34,819
That's pushing it.

319
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:42,059
Come on. What about a big

320
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:44,059
thick steak? No, I don't like steak.

321
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:52,440
Small cold with no ice.

322
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,190
Large cold with no ice.

323
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,190
Bacon, meat, cheese.

324
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:59,369
Meat, bacon, cheese. And a tomato.

325
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:03,910
Oops. Small cold with no ice.

326
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:08,970
Got it. Bacon, lettuce, tomato.

327
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:12,549
But you don't want to...

328
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:14,549
What about the burger I just cooked for you?

329
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:20,890
Why are you guys ordering BLT

330
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:28,250
hamburger buns? Hurry up!

331
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:37,849
No, but

332
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:40,339
I think, and sometimes we go to a

333
00:24:40,339 --> 00:24:42,339
restaurant that

334
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:45,349
I don't know, I don't know what it is.

335
00:24:45,349 --> 00:24:48,230
Some restaurants, they pride themselves

336
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,230
on having these giant

337
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,230
ten ounce fucking hamburger patties.

338
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:54,230
And you know when you can taste?

339
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,230
You can just taste

340
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,410
meat. And it's

341
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,410
gross. It's like just

342
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,410
eating a giant meatball. I don't want to do

343
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,609
that. An eight

344
00:25:05,609 --> 00:25:07,609
ounce fucking, a ten ounce hamburger patty

345
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:09,609
is a gigantic meatball between

346
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:12,039
two pieces of bread. No.

347
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:23,240
I hate it when I can taste my food.

348
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,240
No, it's very specific.

349
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:32,470
Too much meat flavor.

350
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:36,759
Am I a vegetarian?

351
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:39,319
I have a very important question for you. Do

352
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:47,700
vegetarians eat meat?

353
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,700
No. Right. Okay. So

354
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,650
I just, you've seen me eat a McChicken

355
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:56,740
on camera.

356
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,369
You're a pretend meat eater?

357
00:25:59,369 --> 00:26:01,369
I do actually like the Beyond Burgers

358
00:26:01,369 --> 00:26:03,369
though. They are really, really fucking good.

359
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:05,369
I cannot pretend there.

360
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:07,859
I talked so much shit

361
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:09,859
about those burgers, it was unbelievable.

362
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:12,740
I was a certified

363
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,740
shit talker for

364
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:20,759
Beyond Meat. But

365
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:22,759
I have had it and it is

366
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:26,470
pretty good. Pretty good.

367
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:29,099
E.D. certification is no

368
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:31,099
purchase. Equipment menu.

369
00:26:31,099 --> 00:26:40,250
What is it? What shit

370
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:44,410
did I talk?

371
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,410
It was mainly how I didn't think the company

372
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,410
was worth even

373
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,410
close to what the stock price was worth.

374
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,410
Because I saw that. I mean that was big news.

375
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,410
Beyond Meat worth like fucking

376
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,410
five, a hundred billion dollars or something.

377
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:58,410
With like a three hundred dollar stock

378
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,410
price. And I'm like there's no fucking way. What the hell is that?

379
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:06,619
That's bullshit.

380
00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:08,619
That's worth more than

381
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:11,690
like Nvidia. So I talked a bunch of

382
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:14,250
shit. Off camera though.

383
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:18,470
Alright, I gotta get them.

384
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,470
One more day and I can do pizza.

385
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:36,329
Maybe we should do these.

386
00:27:36,329 --> 00:27:38,329
Fisher's gotta come off.

387
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:40,329
No, I can't do lasagna.

388
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:42,329
I'm not capable.

389
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:44,329
How many times have you heard that

390
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,660
in this stream?

391
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:58,019
I'm not capable.

392
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:01,160
Small tea with ice.

393
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,160
I've had

394
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,160
lots of fake meats before

395
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,160
and almost all of them

396
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,099
are gross.

397
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:12,099
You name me any of the most popular brands

398
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:14,099
of fake meat and I'll tell you that

399
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:16,099
they are not good. I've had almost all of them.

400
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:23,400
But the Beyond Burger

401
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,640
was pretty good.

402
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,650
You know the most chicken you eat is actually

403
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:32,869
soy. I don't buy that.

404
00:28:32,869 --> 00:28:35,819
I really don't.

405
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:52,900
Yeah, maybe from Subway.

406
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:57,190
Most chicken that I eat is chicken.

407
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:08,579
Oh boy, I can take the trash off.

408
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:10,579
Are you shitting on Subway?

409
00:29:10,579 --> 00:29:12,579
No, I just said...

410
00:29:12,579 --> 00:29:14,579
You know what? I'm just gonna say

411
00:29:14,579 --> 00:29:24,630
what up.

412
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,630
Meat to meat, lettuce, bacon,

413
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,940
cheese, tomato. Get it out.

414
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,940
This one is double meat, lettuce,

415
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,940
bacon, cheese, tomato.

416
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,940
This one is meat, tomato

417
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,940
only. What a weirdo.

418
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,940
That's weird. That is like having a ketchup

419
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,180
steak. Small cola with ice.

420
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:57,430
I feel attacked.

421
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:00,700
What are you talking about?

422
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,700
People that say you eat steak and ketchup.

423
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,319
That's alright.

424
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:07,319
But saying having a hamburger with just a tomato

425
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:09,319
on it is not...

426
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:11,940
Sorry, that was like

427
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,940
a zeppelin apparently. Okay, hold on.

428
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,940
No!

429
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:29,640
No, I like all kinds of foods.

430
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,519
I do not

431
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:34,519
care what kind of food it is. If I like

432
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:40,599
the taste good, I'll eat it.

433
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:49,690
Just buttery, please. What about

434
00:30:49,690 --> 00:31:03,180
human?

435
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,930
No, I'm not gonna eat

436
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,930
fucking human meat.

437
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:13,299
Medium diet with ice.

438
00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:23,779
How long can I

439
00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:26,539
stay quiet for?

440
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:28,539
Probably a pretty long time. You wanna test?

441
00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:33,400
If I would get an adult

442
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,400
swim show for eating human meat,

443
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,579
would I do it? No.

444
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:39,579
No, 100 times.

445
00:31:39,579 --> 00:31:50,069
Meat, lettuce, bacon, cheese to meat.

446
00:31:50,069 --> 00:32:00,619
Stop talking. What about for a billion

447
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:06,819
dollars?

448
00:32:06,819 --> 00:32:09,059
But I don't know. No, because

449
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:11,059
who am I eating?

450
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:13,240
I don't wanna do

451
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,529
that. I don't know who am I eating.

452
00:32:17,529 --> 00:32:28,660
Oops. I've seen Are You

453
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,660
Afraid of the Dark before. I know that this comes with

454
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:47,500
like a caveat here.

455
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,500
Would you eat human meat

456
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,500
for a billion dollars?

457
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,500
I don't know.

458
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,500
I guess so. But little

459
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:01,059
do you know. You're eating

460
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:03,059
your dear great

461
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:05,059
great grandfather and it's like

462
00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:08,519
no! What is it? Meat only.

463
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:25,539
Can't wait for the pizza.

464
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:32,380
I did that very poorly. You would do

465
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:37,369
that for a hundred bucks.

466
00:33:37,369 --> 00:33:39,369
That's not worth a hundred bucks.

467
00:33:39,369 --> 00:33:42,119
It's not.

468
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:47,609
It's not worth a hundred

469
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:52,599
dollars. You think eating...

470
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:54,599
No. This conversation

471
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,900
is over.

472
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,900
We're not talking about this anymore.

473
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:04,470
What about that meeting?

474
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,710
Shit! What time is it?

475
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,710
Oh no! I missed

476
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:12,739
the meeting. I missed it.

477
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:14,739
There was like seven executives I was meeting to.

478
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:18,650
And I told them like I'm doing this

479
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,650
big stream. I was kind of

480
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:23,079
short on cash. I asked

481
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:25,079
them if they could like pay for all the food and shit before

482
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:27,510
I got there. And I said there was gonna be like

483
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,510
probably thirty people I was inviting.

484
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:40,309
Uh oh. It's alright.

485
00:34:40,309 --> 00:34:43,960
New active menu slot. Rain.

486
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,960
What's a good rainy day food?

487
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,960
Ooh. Pizza. Let's get it.

488
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,460
I'm buying a fresh

489
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:55,900
pizza.

490
00:34:55,900 --> 00:35:11,000
1600. Let's go.

491
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Okay. Put that pizza on there.

492
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,429
Now we're talking.

493
00:35:15,429 --> 00:35:17,429
I gotta get the lasagna back in here as much

494
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:19,429
as I don't want to do it. I hate the lasagna.

495
00:35:19,429 --> 00:35:21,670
PCMSR.

496
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,670
PCMR.

497
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,670
PCR on NR.

498
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,670
PMCSR. I don't remember.

499
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:45,079
Medium water.

500
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:47,079
With no ice. With ice.

501
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:49,579
Fucking idiot.

502
00:35:49,579 --> 00:35:51,579
Call me an idiot. I am gonna call you an idiot.

503
00:35:51,579 --> 00:35:53,940
You opened up the second game and

504
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,940
couldn't fucking figure it out so you quit it immediately.

505
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:59,079
Grow up.

506
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:01,079
Way to be harsh. I'm just telling you

507
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:04,980
like it is. But I

508
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,980
wanted just to relax. I didn't want to have to fucking

509
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,980
like learn a game and embarrass myself in it.

510
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:13,909
You can't simply learn

511
00:36:13,909 --> 00:36:15,909
like two or three new commands.

512
00:36:15,909 --> 00:36:17,909
God.

513
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:40,039
If

514
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:42,039
Jerma986 thinks he's so great, why doesn't he

515
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:46,900
just do it?

516
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,900
And then

517
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,900
PSMCR.

518
00:36:50,900 --> 00:37:09,190
I don't know.

519
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:15,079
PSMCR.

520
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:20,710
Ow. Fuck.

521
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,710
No. What am I pressing?

522
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:26,550
Okay. Small.

523
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,550
I forget. I don't know. I don't know what to do.

524
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:31,300
I fucked up. I don't know. I gotta. I need to restart.

525
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,300
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

526
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:39,380
How do you do it? How do you make a pizza?

527
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,380
Tomato sauce, cheese,

528
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,329
olives and onions.

529
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:47,530
Where's the fucking olives?

530
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,530
Why are the olives on the, on the, what?

531
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,530
Onions is N

532
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,829
again. Slow down.

533
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:55,829
Calm down. It's not a big deal. And V

534
00:37:55,829 --> 00:38:06,329
is olives. So I think

535
00:38:06,329 --> 00:38:11,769
yeah, I could put too much meat

536
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:13,769
on anything really. Pizza included.

537
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:22,980
People do like meat

538
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,539
lovers pizza. You

539
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:27,539
take a slice out of the pie

540
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:29,539
and it just center blocks

541
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:31,539
down and everything falls off and you can't

542
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:33,539
eat it. You just get like that weird bread taste

543
00:38:33,539 --> 00:38:35,539
with like sauce all over it. And then there's

544
00:38:35,539 --> 00:38:37,539
pepperoni sausage and hamburger meat all over the fucking

545
00:38:37,539 --> 00:38:39,539
box. Why do people do that?

546
00:38:39,539 --> 00:38:52,980
Stop it. I hate you.

547
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,420
I like meat on pizza. I like hamburger.

548
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,420
I like onion hamburger and onion

549
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,420
sausage and peppers and

550
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,420
but I don't like sausage hamburgers

551
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,420
pepperonis

552
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,170
lamb and

553
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:08,170
turkey all over it. Like I don't know.

554
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:20,260
Why? What animal

555
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:26,150
does an onion come from?

556
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:37,670
Would I eat crickets?

557
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,659
I mean maybe.

558
00:39:40,659 --> 00:39:44,059
Depends.

559
00:39:44,059 --> 00:39:46,059
No, but I do like meat on pizza. I'm just

560
00:39:46,059 --> 00:39:48,550
just shit posting.

561
00:39:48,550 --> 00:40:00,840
Sorry guys.

562
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,840
PSRPSC

563
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:12,309
Season 3

564
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,309
form juice. Good.

565
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:23,780
The steaks we need.

566
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:30,440
Good. We're good.

567
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:34,599
Not a bad day.

568
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:42,340
Come on. Hurry up and cook.

569
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:45,420
Tomato sauce. Cheese.

570
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,420
I wanted to do C.

571
00:40:47,420 --> 00:41:05,780
Just put everything on it.

572
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:12,250
Jerma slurp.

573
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:15,699
How did I do that that easily?

574
00:41:15,699 --> 00:41:19,860
Because I wasn't paying attention.

575
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,860
I did that incredibly fast and incredibly perfectly.

576
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:26,219
Don't ever make that

577
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:29,289
an emote. Well I'm not on screen.

578
00:41:29,289 --> 00:41:39,139
How would I do that? Jerma your stream is so

579
00:41:39,139 --> 00:41:41,139
loud in comparison to other stuff on Twitch.

580
00:41:41,139 --> 00:41:43,139
When an ad pops up it blows off

581
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:45,639
my speakers. Yeah.

582
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:47,639
I don't know what that is.

583
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:50,010
But I think it has to do with

584
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,380
how I'm pulled through OBS.

585
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,380
And what's going to happen here

586
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,380
in the next, I don't know, I'm going to get

587
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,380
like a hardware mixer to like

588
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:04,780
increase it before it goes in.

589
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,780
So that'll happen soon.

590
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:15,099
You're making an entire lasagna for a

591
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,780
This is Chad

592
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,780
from the meeting. Why are you playing this?

593
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:23,050
Chad I'm sorry.

594
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:25,420
I got the day wrong.

595
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:29,829
I bet you can't get through today without

596
00:42:29,829 --> 00:42:32,519
making a single bad order.

597
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:38,539
I'm not taking that bet. Okay.

598
00:42:38,539 --> 00:42:40,710
Large crowds.

599
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:46,980
It's weird because if I look at

600
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,610
OBS right now, if I

601
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,610
according to the meter for

602
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,610
my microphone on OBS,

603
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:55,780
it says I am

604
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,780
very close right now to peaking

605
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,780
my microphone, like to being in the red.

606
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:04,780
So it's something how I'm

607
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,780
getting pulled into OBS and OBS is not putting

608
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:16,570
it out the way that it should be.

609
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:18,570
What I need is I need like a hardware compressor.

610
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:20,570
But then, you know, this is why I haven't done it.

611
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:22,570
Because then when you put like a

612
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:24,570
compression and like an equalizer on your voice, you end up

613
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:26,809
with one of these. You guys know exactly

614
00:43:26,809 --> 00:43:28,809
what I'm talking about, where everything is like super

615
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:30,809
over equalized and you sound like you're coming out

616
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:33,619
of a radio station. I don't like

617
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:46,940
how that sounds. We need more equalization.

618
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,940
Some people do it fine.

619
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:50,940
Most people do it fine. But sometimes

620
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,940
you find the person that has just like, you know, let me turn

621
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,940
that up. So it's just

622
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,940
this incredibly weird over

623
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,940
incredibly smooth sounding

624
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,940
sound and everything that they say is sounding

625
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:03,429
kind of like this. Well, you know guys, the

626
00:44:03,429 --> 00:44:05,860
thing is, yeah, I think I have to go

627
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:08,230
pick up that thing on the, yeah,

628
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:10,230
what do I need, uh, ten of those? I think I need that. Yeah, I do.

629
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:17,980
Am I shit talking? No, I'm not.

630
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:24,820
Uh, guys, I'm getting one of these.

631
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:28,340
You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna, okay, the first

632
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:30,340
day, you're gonna know I have this, because the first

633
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,710
day I have this, I'm gonna, I'm gonna bang

634
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:34,710
up the equalization as high as I

635
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:41,500
can go. It's gonna be so

636
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:46,039
awful. I want every syllable

637
00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:48,039
to have a

638
00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:50,409
compressed sound to it. Every single

639
00:44:50,409 --> 00:44:52,409
syllable is going to sound like this.

640
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:53,690
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

641
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:55,690
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

642
00:44:55,769 --> 00:44:58,150
I'm gonna over equalize the fuck out of my

643
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:00,150
voice now and I'm gonna keep it for like six

644
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:06,579
months all right let's take, uh,

645
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:08,579
bake potato instead of steak,

646
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:17,019
keep pizza on there. Put a hard limiter

647
00:45:17,019 --> 00:45:19,019
and just crank up the gain.

648
00:45:19,019 --> 00:45:31,110
Just butter.

649
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:33,110

726
01:03:36,059 --> 01:03:47,400
it was probably once in my whole life quick quick now is this opportunity to bring up the

727
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:51,880
the stream i was going to do that i've brought up like three times you guys remember that one

728
01:03:53,420 --> 01:04:19,909
every time somebody brings up the word vaping we always talk about it wow i need to pay attention

729
01:04:19,909 --> 01:04:46,010
one season twice juicy one citrus two beers jumbo grape with ice and flavor blast

730
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:52,199
that's a lot that's too much sugar we already talked about this don't order that

731
01:04:57,530 --> 01:05:25,130
we can die with ice fuck a lasagna four four hurry small tea with ice and flavor

732
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:50,019
i'm getting that down pretty well why would you put a flavor blast in

733
01:05:50,099 --> 01:06:23,050
fucking water this is gross i think these dishes is there a website that that can determine how

734
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:25,929
fast you click something like how fast you can click something in like 10 seconds

735
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:56,059
i want to break the world record real quick before i leave do i think people try to get

736
01:06:56,059 --> 01:07:03,429
my attention with outlandish comments nowadays i mean people just kind of write crazy shit

737
01:07:03,429 --> 01:07:29,800
just to write it so i don't think more than ever jesus jesus what's this one i think this is going

738
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:51,699
to be a this is going to be a perfect day but no i don't think that well the thing is another

739
01:07:51,699 --> 01:07:58,949
thing to keep in mind is the channel has grown a lot in the last year and a half or so last year

740
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:05,130
so you know the over under that somebody might just come into the channel and just write pee

741
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:12,139
pee poo poo and then leave i mean it's it's fairly high so you know that's possible

742
01:08:20,489 --> 01:08:26,939
do i wish that i have grown this much i mean that's kind of a weird question because

743
01:08:27,989 --> 01:08:31,430
i guess the my ultimate goal whenever i do this stuff is i want to

744
01:08:32,869 --> 01:08:39,350
make as many people happy or laugh and be in on the joke as possible right so

745
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:56,579
i don't think it's oh no i don't want to i don't want to have any viewers there's two people tell

746
01:08:56,579 --> 01:09:08,250
me to go back to play team fortress yeah that happens not that often though but i mean that's

747
01:09:08,329 --> 01:09:17,079
what that's i don't doesn't really bother me because at the end of the day no my perfect score

748
01:09:18,439 --> 01:09:42,699
no what if i just don't serve it all right what's that website click as fast as possible about

749
01:09:42,699 --> 01:10:09,189
something the speed test clicking speed test this is cookie clicker this is a cookie clicker

750
01:10:09,189 --> 01:10:34,680
optimizer website is there another one just play cookie clicker no not reaction time i'm talking

751
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:47,800
how fast you can press the button as fast as possible okay this one so it clicks in five

752
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:53,930
