What are you doing? How long is this song?

9
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:55,890
I can't even it's hard to do this like you don't do a Christmas album. If you don't look at the lyrics, I can't do that in song is still going.

10
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:10,340
This song is still going. Do you know the rest of the lyrics? No, but you know, I don't know. Is it really like three minutes in this bullshit? Yeah. Okay, whatever.
