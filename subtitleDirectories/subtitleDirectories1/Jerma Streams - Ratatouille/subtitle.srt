00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:08,009
Hello, good afternoon, morning, or whatever, good, how, wherever you are, hi.

2
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:17,719
Welcome back to the stream, hope you're having a good day. Today we're gonna be playing Lisa.

3
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:22,899
Nope, just kidding, that's never happening. Today we're gonna be playing Doki Doki Literature Club.

4
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:27,559
Nope, just kidding, that's never happening either. Today we're gonna be playing Garfield

5
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:31,399
Cart 2. Just kidding, that's never happening either, that game doesn't even exist. How could it happen?

6
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:42,810
Mystery game today. Fuck you, Lisa's amazing, asshole. I didn't say the game was bad,

7
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:47,420
I just said I'm not gonna stream it. I didn't say, hey, by the way, Lisa the Faithful,

8
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:56,579
sucks. See, not clipped that one. Now I fucked up your clip. I'm gonna clip him saying Lisa the Faithful

9
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:12,980
sucks, you know what I mean? Not gonna happen today. Thanks, Zoidberg. Hey, you're very welcome.

10
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:24,900
Come on in. Everyone's saying Ratatouille. Well, here's the thing about Ratatouille.

11
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:38,010
I promised I would play Ratatouille on the 28th. The problem is, I didn't buy it yet. I said I

12
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:44,390
bought it, I said I owned it, but that was just, it was sitting in my cart, so technically I did

13
00:01:44,390 --> 00:02:01,659
own it, temporarily speaking. Liar. He's a liar. That's not how it works. Anyways, so what we're

14
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:07,780
gonna do today is, because it's a mystery game, we just changed the title to something.

15
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:19,460
I'm gonna cue, let's put the title to, please spell that. Please spell that word. All right.

16
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:27,259
Yeah, today we're gonna be playing, I don't know, I can't spell this fucking word.

17
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:45,050
How do you spell this word? Is it one? A? Two A's? No, I keep my fucking promises.

18
00:02:46,460 --> 00:03:01,349
Ratatouille! Is that loud? How loud was that? I told you guys I was gonna play this on the 28th.

19
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:13,699
I keep my promises. I keep my promises. I do. This is the original. There's like a bandaid over here.

20
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:23,219
This is Disney Pixar Presents Ratatouille, the video game from THQ. I actually looked this up a

21
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:29,639
little bit. This game apparently is fucking terrible. Every review place gave this game like a four.

22
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,319
The game sucks apparently. I don't even know, I don't understand what the joke here is.

23
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:43,110
I think two people said play Ratatouille and I was like, okay, fine. Well, congratulations. You and

24
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:51,129
your friends made me play a game on stream. Hey, Slalom, thanks for the five community subs and

25
00:03:51,129 --> 00:04:00,599
for Litty, thanks for five subs too. I appreciate it. I unironically love this game. I don't know

26
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,520
why I'm so excited. I'm like, I'm like a lightning rod right now. I'm like ready to go. I don't know

27
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:13,050
why this game's gonna be fucking terrible. You know what's funny? I've never seen this movie.

28
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:28,279
Let's go. Sign in and continue. Yeah, I don't, whatever. Who cares? No storage device has

29
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:35,910
been selected, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's fine. On the hard drive. You've never seen,

30
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,980
I've done, I've never seen this movie. I swear to God. You go, oh, I could go right to the

31
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:47,259
cheats if I want to. Let's play the story. Yes, for those of you that don't know, I just hit,

32
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,839
I just hit accept on the first generated name that Xbox gave me. I didn't even care. What the

33
00:04:54,839 --> 00:05:03,420
fuck would I even care? Am I, what do I need to be German 985 on here? My Xbox 360? We're about

34
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:08,540
to start a new game. Would you like to continue? Yes. Select the charms for access to other areas.

35
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:23,129
Oh, collect the charms. Okay. Og, this is David's Xbox. Well, it's my Xbox now.

36
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:31,819
Got us some third party sellers. Thanks, Dave. Okay, cool. So, so far so good.

37
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:38,629
Kind of looks like, um, even pinata a little. Does this follow the movie? Do I have to watch

38
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:53,100
the movie if I beat this game? Yeah, you're clean, pal. Move it along. Yes. It's just the movie.

39
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:06,779
Just about dad. Can't a rat work in peace around here? Is that Pat? Wait, is Pat an

40
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:11,819
Oswald the rat in the movie? Cause we got to get those charms collected before her nap time's over.

41
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:19,959
He is? Oh shit. Charms to be collected boys, so get moving. If we're crying out loud,

42
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:28,740
Emil, stop eating all our supplies. What supplies? Keep an eye on your brother. This sucks,

43
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:34,360
turn it off. You know how much of a pain in the ass I was to get this game?

44
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:39,480
Just a pain in the ass, a real pain in the ass. Oh, I thought he was like smelling his butt.

45
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:47,689
I'm not gonna fuck this on and skip it in the beginning cut scene. That's not happening today.

46
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:57,290
You know how much shit people gave me to make sure I played this game on today's date?

47
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:03,160
All right, here we go. Welcome to Remy's home, Mabel's farm. Here you'll learn what your job

48
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:11,990
is in the colony. Ollo, Emilie. Okay. This is a charm. Collect as many as you can to unlock

49
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:18,389
rewards. Press A to jump. Double jump. This is a double jump in the game? All right, that's kind

50
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:24,779
of cool. It's an edge grab. God, remember when Xbox used to just give you fucking achievements

51
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:30,300
for no reason. You know, you can whip your tail to break stuff. Pretty cool, huh? Give it a try.

52
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:36,839
You can even use it on enemies. They just didn't even care. If you can hit them.

53
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:41,720
Jumping on the first stump. Come on, try it out.

54
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:53,300
He's doing it. Tail swipe. Okay, so it's just an attack. Okay, is this game like an hour and a half

55
00:07:53,300 --> 00:08:03,930
long? Please say it is. You unlock bonus pack one. It's desync? Me or the game? What do you mean?

56
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:17,769
It should be, it's a game? Game sound is all fucked up. Hey, Jerma, slugpog, thanks for the

57
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:20,810
five community subs. Thanks for being an emote that'll be deleted in about three months.

58
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:41,350
Sound is early. All right. All right. Sounds good, right? All right, let's keep going.

59
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:46,759
Slugpog. I don't even know why it's activated. It's chili peppers.

60
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,720
You cook in this game where you just walk around and collect coins.

61
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:11,610
Oh shit, this guy's dead. Go pull us to help him.

62
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:31,610
Pick up an uppers beat. Okay, and then drop it here. Chili peppers can be used to destroy

63
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:46,299
certain objects in the world to defeat enemies. Tail swipe and get away. Okay, cool. It's a little

64
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:50,139
platforming game. Like every single video game that comes out that has a license.

65
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:53,179
Something must be wrong with that wood. Some objects in the world will have a glow

66
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:56,860
outline. That means this means the ready looks like you're gonna need to make your own bridge.

67
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:05,399
What do I do? Try hitting that other plank. I'm convinced that every single movie and TV game

68
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:13,450
that came out from like 1998 to 2010 was all the same engine, same video game that has put

69
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:18,409
different assets sort of in the game world. It's all the same exact game. Oh, I can smell.

70
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:24,649
These things are easy to use. Wrong. It's not wrong. Just jump on and go to town.

71
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:30,679
They just shared the source code with every single movie that was within six months of release.

72
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:36,200
You got to hold down your jump before you release. They changed the coin in this game to like the

73
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:45,590
cheese in another game. The cheese turns into like a star in the other one. Boy Story. Yeah,

74
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:54,730
Toy Story had like fucking action figures instead of coins. Use the same springboard to join me.

75
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,059
You can find out where to go next by using your sense of smell. Nice. I'm so glad that

76
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:12,379
there is like a fable to just walk this way. Idiot button. I almost fucked that up. Hold A

77
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:25,559
to compress it. Oh, I see. Speaking of which, German should play Dead Space one and two for

78
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:31,000
October. I actually might do that. Whenever you come to a wall or a pipe, just jump towards it

79
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,799
and grab on like this. Why am I playing this game right now? There's like no reason to be playing

80
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:48,730
this. There's so many things I can play right now. Grab, jump, and press B.

81
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:57,059
Okay, how long is the game? Somebody said it was... Oh, that's health. I don't have full health.

82
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:09,539
This game is 40 hours. It's 20 plus hours. No, it is not. The only way this game is 20 plus hours

83
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:24,360
is if level one through 10 was copy and pasted 30 times. A rappel object will work on all swarms.

84
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:33,159
Do I get to use the food? Please tell me I get to cook. You can't make a rat tattoo game

85
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:35,879
and not have cooking. I don't want to just like walk around and spray bugs.

86
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:46,889
Did I die? Oh, okay. I was just waiting for like Dark Souls text to pop up and go like

87
00:12:47,129 --> 00:13:01,990
No. The underbuck. All right, now what? Give me more instructions. Chili peppers can be used. Yeah.

88
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,860
Oh, God. He's playing this. Yeah, I am. Because when I tell you I'm going to do something,

89
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,870
I'm going to do it regardless of how detrimental it is. Let me get the strawberries.

90
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:30,090
I don't hate it yet. I don't hate it yet. I kind of like it. Need another chili pepper. I know what

91
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:43,210
to do. Get up here. Is this it? Okay. Can I ask a question? Is the reason why everybody wants me

92
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,889
to play this game regardless of how bad it is? Because this is everybody's favorite movie here.

93
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:53,049
That's why, right? And you overlook how shitty this game is because you love the movie so much.

94
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:58,809
All you care about is like the characters talking. Right? If you want to jump on top,

95
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:04,409
just do this. You're watching like a reunion show, you know, that's a kind of tired and old.

96
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:10,659
But it's still your favorite character. So you like it. Get rid of enemies.

97
00:14:10,659 --> 00:14:18,009
Not to mention, it's a whole lot of fun. That has really bad taste.

98
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,649
Now let's see if you have as much grace as I do.

99
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:30,309
Use the ball. All right. Jump on the ball and press B and you can squash the bugs.

100
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:37,500
There are surfaces in the world that will hurt you. I can get on. Okay. I can use the ball to

101
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:45,049
jump on surfaces that will hurt me like poison. That's one letter grid coming up. Does this count?

102
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:57,259
No, it doesn't count. The car actually has to turn. Oh, that's too bad. When do I get to grab

103
00:14:57,259 --> 00:15:02,539
onto the guy's hair and like fuck with his brain? Like pull his hairs and then give him a headache.

104
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:07,820
When does that happen? So you see the pretty sparkles? Well, jump where they are and you'll

105
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:14,740
end up exactly where you want to be. Cool. Huh? Graphics are actually pretty good.

106
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:23,500
Yeah, they're pretty. They are. They're not bad. Let's see what you got.

107
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:35,220
Jump towards any highlighted point and press B. Use the left stick to balance. Oh, okay.

108
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:55,080
The Tony Hawk manual. Easy. Just play Tony Hawk instead. No, I'm playing Ratatouille.

109
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:02,120
Everybody thought that I was not playing this today too.

110
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:13,399
Everyone was convinced that I didn't buy it. Balance. What the fuck are you doing? No, no,

111
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:24,679
guys. Of course I did. Whoa. Sorry. I don't think you can fail this. This is not failable.

112
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:31,610
All right. Cool. We're good. Climb a pipe. Climb it. All right. I'm interested so far. I'm

113
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:49,879
interested. Check this out, Remy. Grab it, pull back and release the launcher. It's a flinger?

114
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:59,399
Now, watch the master. A fucking eagle just scoops him out of the air with his claws.

115
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:17,740
Use the ratapult. Stand underneath it and hold B. Sorry, Remy, but you need 20 charms to proceed.

116
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:24,519
What? Did I get soft-locked in the tutorial? What do you mean I need 20 charms?

117
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:47,420
I got paywalled? How did that even happen? How did that happen? What? What did I do wrong? I just

118
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:57,990
followed his instructions. I missed the coins. I did? I thought I picked them all up. The water

119
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:08,309
pump handle is stuck. Try jumping on it for a reward. Oh, there's going to be coins in here,

120
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:25,299
right? That'd be... I thought they would just collect... Yeah, I didn't know I needed them.

121
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:42,980
I guess I need them. What do I get? Oh, that's a coin. One? Wait a minute. I need 10 more coins.

122
00:18:45,430 --> 00:19:02,779
10. Did I just run past them? What do you mean 5? Oh, there's a charm hidden in the stump. Blow

123
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:08,950
up the box. All right, I get it. No, no, no. I'm supposed to lose here. This is just a tutorial

124
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:14,940
to explore and learn and figure out what happened. I need to use the rat on a ball to reach this charm.

125
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:20,099
Right. Okay. Where's the rat on a ball? There's a ball. Is there a sprint button?

126
00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:26,940
You know, Remy, if you just use all four of your hands, you could probably go so much faster than

127
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:43,740
this. All right, there's this one. You can dash? Oh, shit, you can. What did I just do? Failed it?

128
00:19:43,740 --> 00:20:01,059
No, I didn't. Oh, that's fast. This is literally a plot point. Collecting coins? I've never seen

129
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:07,660
the movie. I know I'm going to piss off a lot of people when I say this, but I always saw Ratatouille

130
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:13,029
as a filler Pixar movie. Like, it was... Oh, yeah, they came up with like three or four every year

131
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:16,390
or two, and it was like, oh, this is one of the filler ones. I don't need to watch it. I'm just...

132
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:19,829
I'm not saying it's a bad movie. I'm just saying that's how I saw it when it first came out.

133
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:29,829
Oh, shit. Cool. What was this? Take that back. Look, I'm not saying that that's accurate. I'm

134
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:39,109
just saying that's how I felt. What do I do with this? You know how Pixar and Disney came out with

135
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:43,829
a shitload of 3D animated movies? There was like 30 of them over the course of 10 years.

136
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:49,529
Some of them, I was like, I don't know. I guess it's all right. I didn't hate the movies or

137
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:56,470
anything. Apologize for that. I'm sorry. No. Apologize for what? I didn't say anything.

138
00:20:57,349 --> 00:21:04,039
Oh, shit. Find the valve and fix the sprinkler. What is this bullshit? I don't want to do this.

139
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:17,859
Wait, chili pepper. There's one down here, right? You're a Disney hater.

140
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:24,890
Look, once they announce the live action remake of Ratatouille, then I'll care. How's that sound?

141
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:41,539
You actually can do that. Oh, well. What? What just happened? Did I die? That was a trap.

142
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:50,119
What a rat's got to do. All right. I need more coins. I got that one. I got that one.

143
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:57,460
All right. I get that one right there. Daddy will trap. Yeah. What the hell was that?

144
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:05,339
All right. What's your, what do you, what do you want to see for a live action remake for Disney?

145
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:21,539
Nothing. That's true. Who cares? That's true. That's right. Yeah. Who fucking cares?

146
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:27,259
Okay. Once they made the third one in a row, it was like, all right, I don't care anymore.

147
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:32,900
This is fucking stupid. You want cars? Okay. That, that would be actually pretty cool.

148
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:43,980
I need to find a valve. You would have my attention with a, oh, valve. All right. Wait,

149
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:58,539
what happens if a rat fights a squirrel? Imagine looking at what you went to and seeing this in

150
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:03,589
the backyard. What do you do? I would freak out. I'd be like, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

151
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:14,039
I would just go out and start clapping my hands. Really? Sucker punch. You fucking piece of shit.

152
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:17,960
Nice sucker punch. I kicked your ass for like five straight minutes and then you're going to

153
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:23,559
go, my back is turned. Typical fucking squirrel move. Stop. Leave me the fuck alone.

154
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:42,279
Give me this thing. All right. Come on. Come here. Get over here. Stop it. Hey.

155
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:57,609
That's so stupid. All right. Get me out of this. Blow up the squirrel.

156
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:13,940
That's evil. I'm going to blow up the squirrel. All right. So what the hell is that dude? Yeah.

157
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:19,539
Well, let me get up there then. Oh, I think, oh, I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it.

158
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:47,539
Um, why is it not spraying me? It feels like jump on these. All right. This is fucking dumb.

159
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:57,990
I do. I really need to get more coins. What a tutorial this is. All right. I didn't mean that.

160
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:02,869
I think there's a friendly. Are you friendly? Yeah. I just hit the no. Oh yeah. Of course not.

161
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:15,190
I'll get the chili bomb. Is this what it's like when we're not looking like every like

162
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:20,700
toy story and shit. When Andy's not home, the toys have a bunch of fun and they play games with each

163
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,819
other in the animal world. When the humans aren't looking, they kill each other. They eat each other.

164
00:25:25,819 --> 00:25:35,940
They rip each other's heads off. Everyone thinks, Oh yeah. When the animals are together, they talk

165
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,819
and have like fun adventures. None of the rat literally gouges out this little chick's eyes

166
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:45,700
with his hands and then eats his brain. They can't make a movie about that though.

167
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:54,660
All right. What the fuck am I supposed to do here? Something I can, I can bounce on.

168
00:25:55,299 --> 00:26:02,730
I need to, Oh, we need to roll in here with the rollie. Wait, I see that guy, this thing up there.

169
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:11,619
Oh my a psycho. That's real. That's real life. That's what happens. Like in real life,

170
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:15,700
these two would not have a conversation about their taxes. The dove would come down.

171
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:21,460
He'd get tail whipped. He'd get bitten in the face. The rat would lose its tail. This other

172
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:24,180
rat would come over and start eating the other rat, even though they're both rats.

173
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:41,140
I need to get on top of the tractor. No, it isn't Jeremy. You have to go outside.

174
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:49,960
What? There's a hole over here. Hold on. Oh, there's a flinger.

175
00:26:52,680 --> 00:27:03,109
Play chess? Holy shit. Wait, I need to play chess.

176
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:19,109
Oh my God. There's like a thousand coins up here. You collect it. Wait, to glide. I can glide.

177
00:27:19,829 --> 00:27:26,710
How do I glide? Just told me I can glide. Wait a minute. I can do a Mary Poppins.

178
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:52,740
Oh, cool. I got 20 charms. I gotta go find Eddie. Rats. You looked in, by the way,

179
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:59,609
you looked in your backyard to see this many rats. Eh, probably time to actually put the trash out

180
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:04,170
rather than skip it three weeks in a row because you, oh, fuck, I forgot. And it's like already,

181
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:09,450
it's like already 8 a.m. I can't get the fucking trash out now. I can already hear the truck

182
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:15,740
coming down the street. What am I going to go out there in my underwear? Like hold on a second.

183
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,539
I've thought about it before, but then you can't. You just can't do it.

184
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:34,230
How do I get back up here? Yeah. And then you go over in your head. Is it embarrassing for me to

185
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:40,230
go out there with messy hair and underwear and like a pair of socks or not have my trash out?

186
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:46,710
Oh, fuck, I don't know. I don't know. What if I get caught on somebody's ring cam?

187
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,779
I'll wait till next week.

188
00:28:51,019 --> 00:29:00,809
Well, need your help. With what? This. It's a cookbook by Auguste Gusteau, my favorite chef with

189
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:05,450
all sorts of mouthwatering delicacies. Wow. I didn't know you could read.

190
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,700
Just come on. We'll get it now and I'll tell you more later.

191
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,640
I'm getting huge bugleberry vibes from that guy right now. Huge.

192
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:38,579
Oh, I thought the old lady was shooting a shotgun. She has a shotgun. It is a shotgun.

193
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:58,549
Does this happen in the movie? Does this happen in the movie? Oh shit. FPS mode. Run, Remy, run.

194
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:12,869
Why does the lady have a gas mask on and a shotgun? This actually does happen in the movie.

195
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:22,470
Holy shit. Oh, OK. I have to actually run.

196
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:39,400
Make your step and stuff. Get it next time. Go faster. Step in this. OK, it doesn't matter.

197
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:56,420
Go. Trying to get her to step in the mousetrap. That doesn't do anything. OK, cool. Those mousetraps

198
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:08,329
are from me. Touch that one. That was horseshit. God, no. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my

199
00:31:08,329 --> 00:31:28,170
God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh no, you lose speed. I'm dead. Being a great chef sure isn't easy.

200
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:36,140
Imagine seeing grandma. Yeah, this game so far has been look out your window and be surprised.

201
00:31:37,259 --> 00:31:46,420
The old lady outside my window shooting at a moving truck with a gun and a gas mask.

202
00:31:48,869 --> 00:31:55,109
Uh, www.sillo.com and a new apartment in your area that are available now.

203
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:12,380
At least I'm a good cook. I got shot by the gun.

204
00:32:25,829 --> 00:32:29,799
So you're telling me that there's a point in the movie where an old lady with a gas

205
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:35,000
mask on is shooting at the rat with a shotgun. You don't want to see this as a live action movie?

206
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:48,490
Sure. I didn't think of this one first. What did they do first?

207
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:52,009
What was the first live action remake? I'm almost so excited about it.

208
00:32:53,529 --> 00:33:07,990
Shit. Cinderella. Oh, come the fuck on. Really? What? That thing is just in the way.

209
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:13,190
Wasn't Cinderella. Cinderella was like a daytime movie.

210
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:18,710
Talk about like a real remake movie. That was like a TV movie.

211
00:33:35,579 --> 00:33:41,910
Fuck. I'm looking at chat. Somebody said Tarzan. Oh, that was also like a TV movie. Made for TV.

212
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:52,650
Cinderella was a made for TV movie. It wasn't in theaters. Stop looking at chat. Oh, well.

213
00:33:53,450 --> 00:34:10,340
Okay. Honest to God, I'm going to beat this. I can't be one of those people that plays like a

214
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:16,630
three hour long licensed movie video game. It takes like three hours to beat, but I spend like

215
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:21,110
40. And I walked into that like on purpose somehow. And that one too. I don't even know how. I have

216
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:26,869
muscle memory to do a fall joke. I swear to God. I don't even know why. I didn't do anything. I

217
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:51,780
was trying to win. Okay. I just tried to jump, but it didn't do shit. Jump. There's enough

218
00:34:51,780 --> 00:35:03,769
batteries in this fucking thing. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Go. How big is grandma's front yard?

219
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:36,019
Oh, I had an ammo. Sorry, grandma. Sand Raider. Boom, baby. Collected a health container. Oh,

220
00:35:36,019 --> 00:35:53,269
so I got extra health. No reloading in the middle of combat. After the sewer, it's time to cook.

221
00:35:55,030 --> 00:36:10,739
Oh, this looks open and annoying. All right. So does he read the cookbook now or does he already

222
00:36:10,739 --> 00:36:17,619
know how to cook? And why does the rat already know how to cook? Where's his skillet? Where's

223
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:30,469
his fucking burner? Where's his microwave? You're not real. Why am I talking to an

224
00:36:30,469 --> 00:36:52,460
illustration from a book? Excusez-moi, I am chef Auguste Gusteau. Don't you feel like if you

225
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,780
grabbed the tip of his head and pulled him up strongly, you'd make him look like a normal

226
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:29,000
person. Oh, gross. Feeding chum to dogs on the street. This isn't in the movie.

227
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:40,730
My restaurant from five stars to four. Rebuild Gusteau's. I think I can handle that.

228
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:49,989
Turn on captions. Is it available? To find a mission. The compass can tell you where to

229
00:37:49,989 --> 00:37:55,670
find a mission market. Oh, no. You wish to begin a mission. You must start with the mission market.

230
00:37:57,909 --> 00:38:02,789
I thought a mini mission beacon. What fun. Why don't you try a mini mission?

231
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:10,869
Timed challenge. You want? Sure. Great. Two minutes to do something. I guess to follow

232
00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:33,659
him around. All right, let's go. Timed chaos build. It's kind of slow. It's actually the name

233
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:39,480
of a small like three part series I did. I thought it was going to be a huge hit. I thought that was

234
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:48,730
going to be a huge hit for the stream. Minecraft was just getting traction. Everybody loved it.

235
00:38:53,269 --> 00:38:56,070
Didn't really work out so well in my in my head. It was a little different.

236
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:03,460
Collect enough of these items and you'll be able to open a tall mission. Wait, I need to collect

237
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:30,519
these to get a mission gate. This time gate shit currency gate. Fuck. Wait, why am I so heavy on

238
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:48,780
the right? Oh, no, you've lost the race. Let's start over. Oh, it's a race. I thought I was just

239
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:55,980
following him, but I kind of need to see where he goes. I don't know where to go.

240
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:07,530
Okay, you know what a really, really super pro player jumps off the edge, hangs on the edge,

241
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:11,610
jumps up and hang on the edge just because they're bored and they know every inch of every second

242
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:23,139
of the game. Pretend I was doing that. It's going to be a long stream. It is not. It's not going to

243
00:40:23,139 --> 00:40:29,989
be a long stream. I have a finite amount of time I'm willing to give to Ratatouille, the official

244
00:40:29,989 --> 00:40:38,869
licensed video game stream. I don't know what that is. I'm not sure if it's 20 minutes or well,

245
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:47,940
it's been 40. So that's wrong. All right, I'll get it right here. It's been longer than that.

246
00:40:48,500 --> 00:41:02,409
All right, come on. I can do it. Going to the right. All right, don't fuck this up and I win.

247
00:41:02,409 --> 00:41:23,929
What the fuck is going on? Collect enough of these. Wait, I'm going to open a tall mission.

248
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:38,579
Get it! I win. It does sound like Yoda.

249
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:58,789
Not really, though. He did for a second. Supey assistance. All right, cool. I'm looking. Yes,

250
00:41:58,789 --> 00:42:02,630
I'm ready. I'm ready to have fun now. Here comes an actual cooking mission.

251
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:11,960
Oh, Supey mission. I mean, he kind of does. He did one word was like, oh, everything else was not

252
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:27,400
Yoda at all, but I get it. The soup is terrible. Use the spices to fix the soup. Knock the cheese

253
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:32,599
that is on the top shelf into the bucket below. Complete your tasks and don't let the chefs catch

254
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:39,980
you. This is a hidey hole. If you're spotted by a human, you need to run inside of a hole.

255
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:49,670
All right, so let's. I know you are hungry, Remy, but can you help that chef make a soup?

256
00:42:49,829 --> 00:43:05,210
Spice is OK. Sounds like a plan. He said that rat's going to kill me. Oh, fuck, I broke it.

257
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:18,820
Oh, they have to go over here. OK. Imagine that. Imagine jumpscare on the guy on purpose.

258
00:43:19,539 --> 00:43:26,300
You know you can fix that soup. What are you waiting for? It is kind of like Yoda. You're right.

259
00:43:27,099 --> 00:43:42,039
The same noise I just made. I can't even boil water. Fucking useless. I can do that and I'm stupid.

260
00:43:42,760 --> 00:44:05,820
All right, where's the next over here? All right, come on, ding. I did. He just saw me. He just

261
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:13,610
looked right at me. All right, was this this two more? There's two. All right, there's one across.

262
00:44:14,409 --> 00:44:23,429
OK, I gotta climb up and then go down. There's one over there. Blind him. You know you can fix

263
00:44:23,429 --> 00:44:28,630
that soup. What are you waiting for? You've been detected. What are the hidey hole? Tell you where

264
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:44,389
the nearest safe area can be found. Hurry, hurry, hurry. What? He's that much of a psycho? Yeah,

265
00:44:44,389 --> 00:44:58,789
that's it. OK, so can I go from here? Can I jump from here? OK, I know where to go. How long do

266
00:44:58,789 --> 00:45:06,409
you stay over there for? Oh, up. Hold on. There's one over here. It's an invisible wall, of course.

267
00:45:06,409 --> 00:45:22,619
Oh, and this is bad. It's really bad. It's really bad. OK, I'm all right. I'm OK. I'm OK.

268
00:45:22,699 --> 00:45:32,860
You know you can fix that soup. What are you waiting for? Am I stuck down here? A rat's got to do what a

269
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:51,320
rat's got to do. Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go in the hole. How do I get that

270
00:45:51,320 --> 00:46:03,429
one? What the fuck are you doing? All right, there it is. Cream. Find a way to tip the ingredients

271
00:46:03,429 --> 00:46:11,940
into the pot from. Got it. All right, there's only one more. Quickly find a place to hide.

272
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,500
All right, now backstab him.

273
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:33,260
What's his name? This guy's name is Linguini? Like Paul Linguini?

274
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:42,900
Fuck. No, turn around, turn around, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, camera, camera, camera, camera,

275
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:52,150
camera. I've never seen that. I've never seen the movie. I have not seen this movie.

276
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:56,380
Sheesh. The great chef sure isn't easy. I guess I could go that way.

277
00:46:58,219 --> 00:47:07,079
Which one should I get? The one up top or the one down here? I'm going to get the one down here.

278
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:22,550
Hurry, hurry, hurry. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry,

279
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:30,090
hurry. You know you can fix that soup. Stop shitting up, Yoda. I don't need this force ghost to

280
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:38,340
tell me what to do every time. All right, there it is. Got it. Four to four. Now what?

281
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:59,260
Now what? You need the last one regardless? You do? I need the cheese. Oh, bullshit. Is that the

282
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:14,179
cheese over there? Is this the cheese up here? All right, hold on. I got to distract him. I'm

283
00:48:14,179 --> 00:48:26,309
going to go, what's that timer? All right, we're good. You know, what can I tell you? I love good

284
00:48:26,309 --> 00:48:44,780
food. Soupy assistance mission completed. You know, rip out the chef's tongue. Psycho. You,

285
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:59,019
that's you. That guy's gonna unlock hidden bonus material. Oh, well done, Remy. Well done. Perhaps

286
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:07,929
you can also use your nose to find all the rats. It's a perfect place for a colony of rats.

287
00:49:07,929 --> 00:49:14,599
I thought I had a condo or something. Is that the end of the movie? He gets like a condo with the

288
00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:28,440
guy. Thank goodness you're alive. Dad, it's great to see you too. It's dad. But what are you doing

289
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:35,739
here? We're here because of your harebrained scheme back at the cottage. It's hard to move.

290
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:43,400
I got a condo. I'm sorry, dad, but I'm here now and I want to help. How do you know that but not his

291
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:49,159
name? Follow me and we'll get to work. Guys, the main character that's an animal or some mutant or

292
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:54,920
alien or something that lives at the end of the movie with the other main character in a weird

293
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:58,760
kind of like odd couple scenario, that's half of every fucking movie that's ever existed.

294
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:03,639
Aha, there it is. Every Disney Pixar or animated movie that ends like that, always.

295
00:50:05,239 --> 00:50:09,800
It happens in B-movie. Remember B-movie? He moves in with her in the end of the movie.

296
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,079
It would be so nice if you could speak to your father.

297
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:29,210
Okay, okay. Does that happen in B-movie? Yeah, it does. All right, let's sniff. What's that?

298
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:42,250
Trash. Is that auto? Okay, when there's food, any food. If I order like take out or something

299
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:46,409
or if I bring back something from cooking, you look over the side of where Otto's bed is and he

300
00:50:46,409 --> 00:51:00,900
goes, he goes up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up. It's the cutest thing in the world. I kind of

301
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:09,780
miss the force ghost guy. Where should I go now? I'm just going to go this way.

302
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:24,840
You could speak to your father. Find him. There he is. Okay. Hey, okay. Thank you.

303
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:33,530
He's still around. He's going to be a presence the whole game, isn't he?

304
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:57,190
All right. Why can I smell my dad? Did I walk by him? Jumping is fun. That's about it.

305
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:05,619
Okay, I just put my hand up to my face and like did like a like I'm going to talk to the microphone

306
00:52:05,619 --> 00:52:11,139
and I like touch my work on like my fucking hands and all and I got it on my face. I didn't like

307
00:52:11,139 --> 00:52:14,179
that at all. I hated that. I'm not doing that anymore. I don't like to lean in and make like

308
00:52:14,179 --> 00:52:18,500
a hair. I'm leaning in doing a thing. Doesn't mean I'm going to get water on my face. No,

309
00:52:18,579 --> 00:52:26,550
I burnt this thing off. It's fine. This is like 8,000 people that just happen to say that. Like

310
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:32,550
2,000 of you know what I'm talking about. That's a funny joke. Okay, okay. He's right here.

311
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:40,489
How do I talk to my dad? The colony is counting on you to distract that human and get us some

312
00:52:40,489 --> 00:52:46,010
food. They feed dogs a bucket of scraps in the courtyard every day. We need to get a hold of

313
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:51,610
that bucket. Scare the dogs away from the courtyard. An idle rat is a worthless rat.

314
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:56,409
Find a coin in the bird's nest and bring it down to the courtyard. Be careful, son.

315
00:52:56,409 --> 00:53:00,010
They're the gutter of the clutter. Maybe you can help that. I did that one.

316
00:53:01,289 --> 00:53:05,130
Find all the light bulbs. We need the light bulbs. Live in this place up.

317
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:26,469
Oh, God. I got to do all these tasks. There's one cooking mission. Next game, please. I can't. I

318
00:53:26,789 --> 00:53:35,210
can't. Dude, the next game is... Oh, look. This one already right here. Where's this one?

319
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:45,219
No, no, no. I don't want to go back to this stink home. I already did that one. Oh, shit. A cat.

320
00:53:48,250 --> 00:54:01,829
Don't be afraid. Just go in. I've got a bunch of Xbox 360 and Xbox games back here. Whatever it

321
00:54:01,829 --> 00:54:06,539
is, it's going to be on Xbox. I'll pull something out. No, I'm playing Ratatouille right now.

322
00:54:08,389 --> 00:54:18,699
Talk about that later. Get me. Grab something. What's the point of this?

323
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:24,900
What's the light bulb one? Oh, the dog. Scared the dog's way. I got it.

324
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:37,239
There's my restaurant. Yes, and I'm here to see it. Why am I doing this? Stream the movie.

325
00:54:38,199 --> 00:54:54,949
I can't stream the movie Ratatouille. How do I get up there? From here? Fuck, there's something

326
00:54:54,949 --> 00:55:06,630
else here. Stream rationing. No. Hey, that cat just threw a fucking rock.

327
00:55:12,789 --> 00:55:17,239
This floating thing is called a mission market. All right, that's all I wanted.

328
00:55:18,889 --> 00:55:29,500
Hair balls you. X-Men Origins waiting room. No, you can't. Listen, I bet you you're the same guy

329
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:35,659
that said Ratatouille waiting room with a resident sleeper on it like six weeks ago.

330
00:55:35,659 --> 00:55:41,099
I bet you you're the same guy. I was playing a game. I was doing something and I saw like

331
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:45,579
resident sleeper, resident sleeper, Ratatouille for Xbox 360 waiting room, resident sleeper,

332
00:55:45,579 --> 00:55:49,750
and now I'm doing it and here you are again. You can't keep moving the goalposts.

333
00:55:50,550 --> 00:56:03,690
I'm here. Find a way to scare the dog. Yeah, guess what? When I play X-Men Origins, Wolverine,

334
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:07,690
whatever it is, the same person is going to come in. They're going to say, oh, man,

335
00:56:07,769 --> 00:56:12,489
fucking feeding frenzy for popcap.com waiting room. That's not a bad idea.

336
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:23,159
I'll take that idea soon. All right, hold on. I gotta wait. This looks kind of hard.

337
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:41,900
Wasn't there acid? Saw waiting room. Stop it. Find your way to the other side of the alleyway.

338
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:59,190
Yeah. Boom Beach waiting room. Isn't that like an iPhone game? All right, we're good.

339
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:16,500
What do I do about this? Oh shit. I know it's a steam valve. Fuck it. God waiting room. Jack

340
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:21,460
and Dexter waiting room. I'm okay. I'm going to have to stop you on that one. I'm playing

341
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:25,860
Jack and Dexter right now. I may as well. It's just playing the same game.

342
00:57:34,099 --> 00:57:47,429
I'm going now. It's not timed. Oh shit. Wait, I'm going to fuck this up. No, I'm good.

343
00:57:47,989 --> 00:57:53,579
I scared the dog. Knock off a tomato can. Peggle waiting room. I played Peggle on stream.

344
00:57:54,139 --> 00:58:07,510
I've already done that, man. And why did you turn around? What was that for? More Peggle.

345
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:13,900
You don't want more Peggle. I know you don't. Because I extreme fevered almost every single

346
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:19,369
level the last time I played it. What more can I do to impress you? You can't get like 20 extreme

347
00:58:19,369 --> 00:58:22,489
fevers in a row and then be like, yeah, I mean, like you could do better than that. No, I can't.

348
00:58:23,769 --> 00:58:29,750
I cleared five levels in a row with one ball. I can't ever replicate that again.

349
00:58:37,909 --> 00:58:49,940
Oh shit. That was cool. It's down here. Oh, this is just a way to get back up here.

350
00:58:52,599 --> 00:59:14,809
A permanent environmental upgrade. I'm a one ball omega low. I'm trying. I'm trying to stand

351
00:59:14,809 --> 00:59:22,739
with like that. Where you come from with this one. I don't get it. Club Penguin. No, nobody. You

352
00:59:22,739 --> 00:59:31,780
don't want. OK, the special request video games. I think a lot of you have to understand. OK,

353
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:40,179
the special request games. It's really OK right now. There are 82, almost 8300 people here right

354
00:59:40,179 --> 00:59:45,659
now. Four of you really want me to continue to play this and you're like you got your popcorn

355
00:59:45,659 --> 00:59:48,539
ready. You were like, holy fuck, I can't believe you playing this. My favorite game ever when I

356
00:59:48,539 --> 00:59:56,949
was a kid. And that and I'm doing it for you. You'll get yours eventually. You will. You will.

357
00:59:58,199 --> 01:00:03,079
You're going to say like, oh, dude, remember that game Mischief Makers for the N64? Wow,

358
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:05,960
you should play that, dude. I loved that game when I was a kid and I'm going to play it for you.

359
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:22,710
One day. I didn't see that. Being a great chef sure isn't easy. It's right on my neck.

360
01:00:30,539 --> 01:00:41,420
Why even balance? Just fucking go. Onimusha waiting room. Onimusha.

361
01:00:42,219 --> 01:00:53,739
How do I know what that is? Nice. All right, I'm good.

362
01:00:55,400 --> 01:01:06,019
Almost there. I don't fuck it up. Being a great chef. I hit B on it and it didn't do anything.

363
01:01:08,809 --> 01:01:14,940
I didn't miss the coin. Play League of... Okay, that's one thing I will never play.

364
01:01:15,659 --> 01:01:20,550
I promise. Okay, you know how I said that like four of you are really excited that I'm here

365
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:24,710
right now playing this game? There's probably like 3,000 of you here that would be excited

366
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:30,070
if I played League. I don't care. I only impress like three people, not like 5,000. I'm sorry.

367
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:44,679
Got it. All right. I scared the dog. This is such an elaborate way for me to scare this dog.

368
01:01:45,559 --> 01:01:51,579
I'm guessing I'm going to keep going. Oh, God. Minigame unlocked. What minigame?

369
01:01:54,329 --> 01:02:04,650
Play Neverhood. Maybe one day. I kind of like this game though. I'm not kidding.

370
01:02:05,699 --> 01:02:09,699
Typically by now I would be like, oh yeah, let's do something else.

371
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:20,340
No, not today. I kind of like this. It's kind of fun. I don't hate this. What am I doing?

372
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:36,090
Find a way to scare the dog. Wait, right here. This is it. I'm not going to kill the dog, right?

373
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:50,539
The dog almost just exploded. Oh, now. Wow. Wow. Mission complete.

374
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:58,730
Should we do Jinx at the Sphinx? Right. Yeah, that's another one. That's another one. You'll

375
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:10,329
see, maybe. Somebody said worst stream contender? Get out of here. I'll give this a request stream

376
01:03:10,329 --> 01:03:17,179
and get out of here. Ban that guy for real. I'm just like having fun playing Ratatouille.

377
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:36,469
Get out of here. He's still playing this? Yeah, I want to play it. It took me. It took me. It took

378
01:03:36,469 --> 01:03:42,010
me. Hold on. Let me detuber that a little bit. It took me like three months to get this game and

379
01:03:42,010 --> 01:03:47,619
find it and be like, yeah, I guess I'll pay for $75 for it. No, I'm playing this for like another

380
01:03:47,619 --> 01:04:06,630
at least 20 minutes. The dog is gone. Yeah, we got dog shortcut unlocked. Those four guys don't

381
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:15,579
even exist. Yeah. Oh, they don't? Really? Really? Okay. Let's find out. Let's see. I'm curious. Hey,

382
01:04:15,579 --> 01:04:22,409
excuse me. Sit down for a second. Let's do a straw poll. Straw poll. Let's see how many. Okay,

383
01:04:22,409 --> 01:04:28,969
it's more than four. If this gets more than four votes for yes, I like this game, keep playing it,

384
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:36,139
then we're good. If this gets less than four votes, I will change to whatever game you want.

385
01:04:36,139 --> 01:04:54,949
You ready? This poll is called. Here we go. You like this? Yes. No. Here we go. If this gets more

386
01:04:54,949 --> 01:05:03,800
than four votes. Oh, fuck. All right, we're good. All I'm looking for is four yeses.

387
01:05:11,099 --> 01:05:18,059
Oh, would you look at that? Two, 300, 500, 600. It's 40% of you guys.

388
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:33,559
42%. It's more than four guys, isn't it? Those are bots. Shit, a lot of people are voting on this,

389
01:05:33,559 --> 01:05:38,300
by the way, and we never get this much participation. It's like 3000 votes right now.

390
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:45,030
Find the chili peppers. All right, avoid the thief.

391
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:50,920
Ooh, if I have to, but only because the other rats are counting for me.

392
01:05:50,920 --> 01:06:03,559
Seven boxes left. All right, let's go. People happy. Yeah. Do a new poll. That's 45%. That's

393
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:08,840
more than one. Dude, those four guys aren't even here. You're right. No, they were replaced by

394
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:19,420
apparently like 1300 people. People have spoken. The majority wants me to stop, but the large

395
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:26,489
minority wants me to stay, and that's what we're doing. I never said this was a democracy

396
01:06:26,489 --> 01:06:37,539
right now. I said this was a one guy moment, and there's 1500 one guys. I'm going to clear the

397
01:06:37,539 --> 01:06:57,769
gutters. There was gerrymandering. No. Okay, I got to clear the trash. You're distracting me on purpose

398
01:06:57,769 --> 01:07:04,409
now. You're doing this to me. What is this? Robots? You're distracting me on purpose because

399
01:07:04,409 --> 01:07:08,090
you know that I'm going to be like, okay, I don't understand what to do or where to go, so we're

400
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:21,510
going to play saw. I don't even say that. Guys, even if I put saw in, I don't even know where to start.

401
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:29,210
There's like an hour left of saw. All right. Okay. Are you listening? Are you listening? Are you

402
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:45,670
listening? I will finish saw tonight. Okay. Are you all right? Are you good? Are you good? All right.

403
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:53,539
No way. Yeah. I will finish saw one tonight so that we can prepare for saw two during

404
01:07:53,539 --> 01:08:05,980
the Halloween October month. Get that back. 24-hour stream. It's only been one hour, so

405
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:17,050
no. It's not going to be even close. This game is fucking sick. Actually, it's not even that bad.

406
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:29,670
You guys need to give it a real chance. How much was left in saw? Like one to two hours,

407
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:41,770
right? There was like less than an hour or two, wasn't there? Four hours? No way.

408
01:08:42,489 --> 01:09:02,579
Irma's chat fucking sucks, dude. Where did it go? At first, I just gave it. It was like, oh,

409
01:09:02,579 --> 01:09:15,000
fuck this. All right. I'm going to go a different way. Can I not jump? I'm going to knock them out,

410
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:25,560
pick it up, and then run. Here we go. Was it diminishing returns on the stun?

411
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:46,680
Fuck out of here. Leave me alone. World of Warcraft. Oh, shit. I can do a double here.

412
01:09:47,319 --> 01:09:57,739
Please don't tell me I just screwed this up. Did I mess it up? I think I screwed it up.

413
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:07,670
Oh, shit. Does it still work? Like Ghostbusters Remastered. I hope this still works.

414
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:26,340
Doesn't have to be like in the indicator. Oh, thank you. Oh, I got something. Is there any

415
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:34,380
good Ghostbusters game? Yeah. Okay. That Ghostbusters game from like 2008. It was pretty good. It was.

416
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:40,329
It was all right. I wouldn't necessarily say it was the greatest game I've ever played. It was

417
01:10:40,329 --> 01:10:53,750
pretty good. I liked it. It did a good job. Can I drag the box? I don't think I can drag anything.

418
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:59,210
I'm really getting another double.

419
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:13,270
One clean gutter. Coming up. Luigi's Mansion? Nah. Nah. No, Luigi's Mansion. Not right now.

420
01:11:13,829 --> 01:11:25,779
Okay, there's only two more boxes and we're good. Oh, how funny is it that I played Mario Sunshine

421
01:11:25,779 --> 01:11:34,630
on the GameCube and they just decided to HD re-release it. When I saw that, I was like,

422
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:39,510
come on, man. It's been like fucking 15 years. Like what are you doing that after I play it?

423
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:45,909
Hey, watch the stream. Nintendo watches the streams. Shit, I gotta go the other way.

424
01:11:45,909 --> 01:12:04,520
It's trash. Is it? Yeah, I guess it's been confirmed that the head of Nintendo of

425
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:17,770
Antarctica watches the streams. I've gotten DMs about it. How do I get this over there?

426
01:12:21,529 --> 01:12:30,619
The hell? Can I not go that way? Can I drop this down? I can't throw it.

427
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:43,130
Ow. Fuck. Easy. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Leave me alone, squirrel. Leave me alone.

428
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:47,670
Ignite it and then talk. No, I got it right here. All right. Is this the last two, right? Yeah.

429
01:12:48,390 --> 01:13:11,109
There's one more. Shit. Bro. Bunker ass. Last one's down there. I got it. I know, dude. I have one

430
01:13:11,109 --> 01:13:17,689
box left. Are you watching the same person? Who are you talking to? It's obviously not me.

431
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:34,760
Last one. Oh, I can walk it, right? Turn off the tutorials. Oh, all right. Am I going to die if

432
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:49,430
I fall from here? How much fall damage is too much fall damage? Wait, it's exploding. Oh,

433
01:13:50,229 --> 01:14:08,630
that's annoying. Fucking ruined. It's fine. Yoda is stupid.

434
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:30,840
Yoda's not stupid. Yoda's one of the smartest Jedi ever. All right. You cannot let it go at all.

435
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:37,079
You cannot let it go at all. It has to be very gentle. I probably shouldn't even get this one

436
01:14:37,079 --> 01:14:54,329
then. You're stalling for viewers. You think that's going to help me? Stalling in Ratatouille is

437
01:14:54,329 --> 01:14:59,779
going to help me with viewers? It's the other way around. I can't get this one. This one doesn't

438
01:14:59,779 --> 01:15:08,180
work. If I drop it, what happens? Of course. Fuck. Whatever. Let's go the other way. Oh, dude. He's

439
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:14,489
definitely stalling to lose viewers. That's what you mean. No, you guys aren't going anywhere.

440
01:15:19,130 --> 01:15:23,050
I just saw baited all of you. Now you're going to stay to the end of the stream.

441
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:26,819
You're going to watch all the ads. You're going to watch. You're going to stay the whole time.

442
01:15:26,819 --> 01:15:29,859
You're going to keep my engagements up because you know saw is coming at some point.

443
01:15:30,579 --> 01:15:36,310
I've been saw baited. It's going to happen. I'm going to play saw. You know what I am.

444
01:15:36,869 --> 01:15:46,250
It's not yet. This is like, okay, I'm going to go like activate a bounty for saw

445
01:15:46,970 --> 01:15:53,369
and the whole time I'm going to be streaming naked. Trying to get like 50,000 viewers here.

446
01:15:53,369 --> 01:16:01,300
Okay, now let's play saw for the bounty. I have to have as many people there as possible. The

447
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:17,529
sponsors think it's cool. I just stream naked for an hour and then I turn the webcam off,

448
01:16:17,529 --> 01:16:21,289
turn on saw. It's a sponsored stream. There's 50,000 people here. I call this guy that's

449
01:16:21,289 --> 01:16:24,250
sponsoring the stream. Hey, come look at the stream, man. There's a lot of people here right now.

450
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:31,800
Holy shit, man. That was a good idea to like have to sponsor that stream. There's 50,000 people here,

451
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:43,689
dude. And then 20 minutes, like 30 minutes later, I get banned. Hey, we're just like checking in.

452
01:16:43,689 --> 01:16:48,779
We saw that your channel has been like permanently removed. Huge numbers though, by the way.

453
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:58,020
Yeah. So what's that payout look like? Um, it's like, it's like $700,000. Okay. Time to retire.

454
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:28,659
Goodbye. Oh, what's that? Carrying cash. Oh, nice to have to negotiate that like in your

455
01:17:28,659 --> 01:17:36,710
contract with a sponsorship or like if you do to claim this. Yeah. Is it okay if I stream like,

456
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:41,670
you know, naked for an hour? And then if I hit like 100,000 concurrent viewers,

457
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:46,279
because I'm like the naked guy on Twitch, because that's still counts, right?

458
01:17:46,920 --> 01:18:09,079
If I immediately switch to your game, it has to. What's that for? What's that for?

459
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:16,569
Hear me? You play. Oh, I want to play mafia. That's another thing I'm doing. Oh shit. Let's

460
01:18:16,569 --> 01:18:20,789
do that tomorrow. Let's play mafia tomorrow. The mafia remake. I'm playing that tomorrow.

461
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:31,350
Oh yeah. Yeah. Playing mafia remake tomorrow. Good call. Good call. Oh, there's nothing there.

462
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:40,579
I'm going to play it anyways, but good call. All right. What are the missions? I have like two or

463
01:18:40,579 --> 01:18:59,079
three more, right? Yeah. I want to play mafia. I've heard it's good. I've heard it's very,

464
01:18:59,079 --> 01:19:04,069
very passable, which these days passable means good in the video game industry. Now

465
01:19:06,699 --> 01:19:15,430
six and a half out of 10 is now a nine in this new world. We're in a video game.

466
01:19:21,369 --> 01:19:27,239
Olives. Oh, spit them out. Gross. Crush them up into oil. And you got my attention.

467
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:36,789
Not whole though. Disgusting. Cutting board calamity. Oh shit. This is a cooking mission.

468
01:19:37,430 --> 01:19:49,699
Would you date Remy if you were a rat? No. I may. Does somebody say olive eating challenge?

469
01:19:49,699 --> 01:19:58,979
Or am I making that up? Smash 30 veggies before the time runs out. Oh shit. This is cool.

470
01:20:02,789 --> 01:20:17,850
Just a trash compactor. Scream dark souls. What is this spam? You should scream dark souls while

471
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:21,130
naked and you start the camera resolution at like one by one pixel. And every time you die,

472
01:20:21,130 --> 01:20:24,489
the resolution doubles. I think it's a great idea. It's like a sword art online,

473
01:20:24,489 --> 01:20:27,529
but instead of dying in real life, you slowly get exposed to tens of thousands of people all

474
01:20:27,529 --> 01:20:44,899
over the world. That's quite the challenge. Imagine you would be trying as hard as you could. That

475
01:20:44,899 --> 01:20:53,189
would be a silent stream. Oh, wait, wait, wait. This is important to think about one by one pixel

476
01:20:54,890 --> 01:20:58,649
that doubles in resolution quality or that increases in how much percentage

477
01:20:59,609 --> 01:21:05,960
every time I die. How long would it take before your penile area is visible? How long?

478
01:21:07,659 --> 01:21:12,859
One times one. How many pixels would it be for you to determine like the actual area?

479
01:21:13,899 --> 01:21:21,829
Two, two, four, four, eight, eight. It would take like five deaths before I got banned from the

480
01:21:21,829 --> 01:21:31,350
fucking site. 20 deaths, 32 by 32. But it would have to be like wicked blurry too. And like every

481
01:21:31,350 --> 01:21:36,970
time you died after it got to like 32 by 32, how many times did I die in dark souls? That's what

482
01:21:36,970 --> 01:21:42,939
I'm asking. I think I died like a hundred and like 12 times. So not only would it be visible,

483
01:21:42,939 --> 01:22:03,050
but it would be in 4k by the time that I got to there. So that's not going to work. What a great

484
01:22:03,050 --> 01:22:21,609
idea. Your penis takes up one pixel. It's so like fucking rude and like weird and gross and unnecessary.

485
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:52,420
Have you explored? Oh, okay. Let's keep going. Pixel dick. That's fucking funny. That's funny.

486
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:56,659
All right. I don't, whatever. It's a, you clicked on the mature audience thing when you got here.

487
01:22:56,659 --> 01:23:05,979
You're fine. You are aware. We're all mature audience here. You clicked it. If you collect

488
01:23:05,979 --> 01:23:23,720
another one, one by one of one pixel webcam that increases in quality, but you're naked. So you

489
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:31,899
better not die more than 50 times in whatever game you're playing. That's such an unbelievable.

490
01:23:31,899 --> 01:23:46,739
That's like such a fucked up. I'm going to throw up. Where am I? I hate this. I hate this so much.

491
01:23:46,739 --> 01:24:12,539
You have no idea. Where am I? What? All I heard was get it. Oh, this sucks. I don't want to do

492
01:24:12,539 --> 01:24:33,829
this one again. Come on. This shit. All right. Do it again. Get it next time. Are you going to play

493
01:24:33,829 --> 01:24:40,329
Hades? They put a huge Easter egg about you in the game. What are you talking about?

494
01:24:40,890 --> 01:25:05,340
They did. All right. I got to beat this. That's debated. I would, I, why the hell would they,

495
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:19,560
what would it, what is it? That's just a monster debate. Is that what you're telling me?

496
01:25:20,359 --> 01:25:54,869
Come on. I need two more of these damn things. Come on. Oh yeah. Come on. One more. What sloppy

497
01:25:54,869 --> 01:26:10,489
piece of shit. There's 8,000 people here watching you play ratatouille.

498
01:26:11,449 --> 01:26:16,840
I mean, yeah, I guess there is that speaks to the quality of the video game.

499
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:23,350
Right. That's people you're interested. I'm interested. No, it's not time for saw.

500
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:36,970
All right. I'm doing it. Let's go. One, two, three, silence. You have bots. If you, okay.

501
01:26:36,970 --> 01:26:42,569
If you think that I've been doing this shit for 10 years and at year number 10 is the year that

502
01:26:42,569 --> 01:27:20,470
I decide to turn on bots. I don't know, man. What? I don't know. Tell you. Come on. All right. Left

503
01:27:20,470 --> 01:27:59,529
side. Three more. Hey, let's never do that again. I collected cream. Nice job. Twitch

504
01:27:59,529 --> 01:28:04,939
username here. All right. What was, what was I doing over here? Oh, I cleared the gutters.

505
01:28:05,659 --> 01:28:16,859
Now what? I didn't get to the next mission. Springboard race. Get to the end. Sure. That's

506
01:28:16,859 --> 01:28:42,970
right. Oh, this is awesome. Okay. I'm going to do good. Is it okay? Odd watchers skip ahead.

507
01:28:42,970 --> 01:29:00,470
15 minutes for saw and gamer wort pixel. What? Wait, is that implying that I'm going to show

508
01:29:00,470 --> 01:29:08,600
my hand in 15 minutes? I'm not going to do that. I need a, where's the, I need a,

509
01:29:09,399 --> 01:29:19,109
where's the, where's the other missions? I need more missions. I'm going to go back to the rat cave.

510
01:29:20,010 --> 01:29:27,560
Wait, no, over here. Have I gone over this way? Shit. I can't go that way. Um, should I go?

511
01:29:28,279 --> 01:29:33,220
No, I'm not doing a wort reveal. That's disgusting. And I don't want you to see that.

512
01:29:33,220 --> 01:29:39,159
It makes me sick. Thanks for signing up for this trial run of Twitch bot services. And we hope you

513
01:29:39,159 --> 01:29:44,329
are enjoying your personalized ego boost. I'm going to read the rest of that just because I

514
01:29:44,329 --> 01:29:49,449
feel like it. You have 30, you have 30 days until your trail is over. If you were enjoying your

515
01:29:49,449 --> 01:30:02,869
service, sign up for a one year activation plan. It actually, it said trail. I didn't say trial

516
01:30:02,869 --> 01:30:15,239
wrong. It was trail activate. I should probably like alt tabbed. And you guys saw that I had a

517
01:30:15,239 --> 01:30:24,220
view bot running and it was like 10 view bots. Like apparently I'm so, I need those extra 10

518
01:30:24,220 --> 01:30:36,739
people. What am I going to do? Tell me. I want to know the missions, dude. That was a repeated

519
01:30:36,739 --> 01:30:40,579
joke. Same joke. No, it's not. That's not true. That's not the same joke as last week. The joke

520
01:30:40,579 --> 01:30:45,619
last week was if I just revealed that I have view bots, not that they were 10. I added to the joke

521
01:30:45,619 --> 01:31:01,180
from last week. That's not the same joke. It's not a repeat. No, it's not. No, it isn't. That was a

522
01:31:01,180 --> 01:31:13,829
different, that was a different piece of humor attached to the same idea. And look at the rules,

523
01:31:13,829 --> 01:31:21,300
guys. Disagreeing with the streamer is a banable offense. Don't do it. I can go up there. There's

524
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:33,350
one here. There's a, okay. There's one up there. I'm going to go up there. There's a menu up there.

525
01:31:33,350 --> 01:31:44,569
I can get it. Okay. Yes. Good stream. Thank you. You think so? Nice. Good. Because if you didn't,

526
01:31:46,090 --> 01:31:51,260
you know what? I put my finger up and across. You know what I mean? You're banned. You're up.

527
01:31:51,819 --> 01:32:12,069
Oh, right there. Okay. I see. That way. He's a murderer. No, I'm not. You're missing what I'm

528
01:32:12,069 --> 01:32:28,520
saying. And I'm dead. I just did an Olympic dive. Okay. I did just say. Worst link. I'm not clicking

529
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:40,520
on any links right now. I'm busy. Wait, I got to go. What's the fastest way? Okay. I see. We're

530
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:48,810
going this way. The link sucks. Don't worry. I'm not going to soulless Marvel video. So all this

531
01:32:48,810 --> 01:33:00,779
Marvel 2020 video game waiting room, soulless. Wait, is that the moment where it's the porn actor

532
01:33:00,779 --> 01:33:25,989
versions of all the people get up there? Yes. What? What do you mean? What? That thing was

533
01:33:25,989 --> 01:33:47,539
clearly turned off. All right. Do not. We're going to go this way. Wait, coin. Shit. I'm

534
01:33:47,539 --> 01:33:54,069
actually, I like, I'm starting to actually unironically enjoy this game. You know what

535
01:33:54,069 --> 01:34:00,069
I mean? I'm unironically enjoying Ratatouille. Is that bad? That's kind of not a bad thing though,

536
01:34:00,069 --> 01:34:13,539
is it? I don't think so. I got a mini game. It seems like a solid seven and a 10. It's pretty

537
01:34:13,539 --> 01:34:22,489
solid seven and a 10. This is where I want to be up here. Right there. Mini game.

538
01:34:23,130 --> 01:34:34,069
Have you explored all of his dreams? Daring dash stage one. Was I lying earlier? I lie every day.

539
01:34:34,630 --> 01:34:40,420
Sometimes I lie about a lie I already told. So there's a double lie going on and I don't know

540
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:46,260
which one I actually tried to put off as real. And I, oh, what do you mean? This one again?

541
01:34:47,300 --> 01:35:04,310
Didn't I already do this one? I walked too far and went over the edge. That's how well I was doing.

542
01:35:04,390 --> 01:35:16,170
This one's way harder than the other one. Under, underneath both of those, by the way. Good.

543
01:35:17,989 --> 01:35:39,579
Hit detection. You know what I'm saying? Hit, hit, hit, hit. All right. This is fine.

544
01:35:39,579 --> 01:35:59,239
Yes. What'd I get? Chocolat. Great. You don't ever do that to your ear.

545
01:35:59,239 --> 01:36:03,159
Otto will be up in the bed sometimes and I'll just kind of roll over and I'll feel inside

546
01:36:03,159 --> 01:36:13,640
of my ear. Just and I'm like, have you explored all of his dream worlds?

547
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:26,539
Oh, have I? Nice. Okay. There's another one. The ant army has invaded the courtyard. Clear the

548
01:36:26,539 --> 01:36:34,649
the courtyard of 10 ants before time runs out the courtyard of the 10 view

549
01:36:34,649 --> 01:36:56,859
bots they got already lost shit they have the same spider movement pattern and

550
01:36:56,859 --> 01:37:14,380
binding of Isaac and that's why I hate those enemies huh I could beat the hush

551
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:19,180
with my eyes closed but I will get hit in the first room five times by the same

552
01:37:19,180 --> 01:37:36,770
