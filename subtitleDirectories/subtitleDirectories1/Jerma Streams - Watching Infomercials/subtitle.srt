1
00:00:02,299 --> 00:00:07,299
Let me clear it up. Let me clear it up because people are a little confused.

2
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:10,580
People get a little confused and that's okay. I can help.

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:19,079
I have 100% guaranteed that I would be late. I did not 100% guarantee I would be here at 420.

4
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:25,739
I just said 100% guaranteed. 100% I'm gonna be late.

5
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,500
I never said, what did I say, 415? I said 415 is what I'm looking at.

6
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:47,960
I said I 100% guarantee. Oh shit, I got logs. I'll be back in a little bit to start.

7
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:54,600
Definitely starting at like, at like 415 by the way. At like 415 by the way.

8
00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:06,489
Like 100% chance. 100% chance that I'm gonna be late. Like like 415. I'll be around at like 415.

9
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:22,099
Yeah, it's like 415. Like 430, 415, 420, 425, 424. He's gaslighting.

10
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:27,239
No, I said I was gonna be like 415. Okay, let me ask you a question.

11
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:35,430
If on the back of the microwave food box, like let's say you have like a turkey dinner in the

12
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:42,310
microwave. If it's set on the back of the box, put in the microwave for like five minutes with a

13
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:52,500
question mark. Would you trust it? No, you wouldn't. You want, you need an exact time.

14
00:01:52,500 --> 00:02:06,790
Saying like before time is not an exact time. I'll be back at like 415. If somebody says that,

15
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:19,610
that means, all right, I can't, it's gonna be like 410 to like 425. You're high on weed,

16
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:41,379
100% guaranteed. Where's the sponsor? We're not doing that yet. Can we get a comment of

17
00:02:41,460 --> 00:03:01,860
your obsession with being TikTok famous? Guys, I don't own the app TikTok. I don't even know

18
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:10,469
if I'm on TikTok. All I know is that what I told you before, if I was on TikTok, I'd be huge.

19
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:16,219
People keep coming to me. Hey, Jerma, do you see like this thing? It's got like 500 million views

20
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:21,340
on it and it's like you. Oh, okay. But you still don't believe me when I say I would be huge if

21
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:29,530
I was on it. Oh, Jerma, like they dedicated like a whole entire segment to you on TikTok here. It's

22
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:35,129
like this big, it's got like 400,000 views. Oh, but no, I would not be, that would not be a thing

23
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:52,330
on there if I started. I'd go on there and I'd change the world. Okay. Okay. Imagine being,

24
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:58,979
having that inflated of an ego that you think that like you as an E-clown would change everything

25
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:10,310
if you made a TikTok account. That's, that's next level. That is stratosphere level megalomania.

26
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:27,560
Is he Joe? Of course it's a joke. My TikTok will change the world. This guy is a Vin Diesel

27
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,259
streamer. I kind of know what you mean by that, but at the same time I don't. I don't know why

28
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:47,300
I know what you mean, but I don't know what you mean at the same time. It's because you're bald.

29
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:55,910
I'm not at all actually, but let me, let's go over what's going to happen today. Let me first,

30
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:06,649
let me clear my disgusting throat before people get grossed out. Okay. So this is going to be an

31
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:10,790
interesting day. There's something happening on this stream that I've never done before really.

32
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:19,449
I'm testing to see how it works, seeing how I like it. So let's go over what's happening.

33
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:26,009
I've been watching a lot of infomercials. It's better than TV. As you see, I have my,

34
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:30,490
I've got my, you know, been on my list of, you know, how I feel about like greater than, less than.

35
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:35,209
I actually think that a lot of infomercials are more interesting and more entertaining than

36
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:43,100
television or movies. So I've been on a big kick of it. I get on a kick of watching infomercials

37
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:50,980
every maybe once a year or two. So I figured if I'm on the kick right now, there's so much

38
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:56,870
shit to dissect in these videos and in these products. I kind of want to like, well, I,

39
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:02,620
if it's, if I'm not going to, I'm going to watch them in bed anyways. And some of these,

40
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:11,220
some of these products are insane and some of them are just fun to watch. He's on a kick. Yeah.

41
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:24,620
AP Sensory 2.0, absolutely no fucking chance. And then after we do this, this is just something that

42
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,139
I was just like, I want to do this. I've been thinking about doing the infomercial watch,

43
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,860
like the React Andy stream for a few months now. I just didn't know when to do it.

44
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,920
But after that, we'll do this for a little while. I'm going to be playing the Serpent Rogue

45
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:47,800
as a sponsor stream. I played the demo. I looked it up. It's like, this looks pretty fun. I,

46
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:55,379
I guess I'll do it. Yeah. So what I need you guys to do is this is the first time I've ever been

47
00:06:55,379 --> 00:07:01,189
sponsored on this stream. Besides, you know, obviously the dollhouse fucking better make me

48
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:13,670
look good. You know what I'm saying? It's not going to happen. No way we aren't doing that.

49
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:22,519
You better make me look good. But in all honesty, like I'll not mess it around. And like, this is

50
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:27,000
like, you know, this is, is Jeremy talking to, you know, I've never done this before.

51
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,220
So I really hope the game's fun. It does seem like it's a pretty good, fun, good experience

52
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:42,180
from what I played. I don't know. We'll find out. It looks cool. And I will say this again,

53
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:47,129
because I said it a couple of days ago, but I will reiterate it. It's Jeremy talking to you now.

54
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:54,949
I have been pretty selective so far with what has been presented to me.

55
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:02,149
So don't worry. I'm not just, this is not going to just be a, oh yeah, just I'll take anything.

56
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,990
Sure. How much are they going to, how much are they paying? Oh, yeah. Fuck yeah.

57
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:13,930
No, I, I've been very selective already. So this looks really fun. I'm, I'm actually interested.

58
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:32,519
No, what? No, no, I'm not, I don't, I, that's, I'm not going to even say out loud what you guys

59
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:39,159
saying. I'm not even going to say it out loud. But anyways, I want, I got a lot of infomercials

60
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:43,980
here. Some of these, I've seen these before and I want to go over these products with you.

61
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,659
Then by the way, some of these are like 10 to 20 years old. So

62
00:08:48,870 --> 00:09:00,679
they may have been some new innovations since then. You need to sell these to us.

63
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,039
Guys, half these products probably don't exist anymore. What are you talking? I mean,

64
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:08,120
I don't think any of these exist. Some of these might not even exist.

65
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:21,080
You go into bed, have a good night. Hope you get a good rest. I can't sell them to you.

66
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:28,169
We're getting sold too in these commercials. I mean, let's literally, are you ready? Let's just go.

67
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:36,120
I got this, like 500 of these. I'm actually really excited. I love old infomercials.

68
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:52,889
All right. What do you guys, what do you think you want to start with over here? What do you think?

69
00:09:52,889 --> 00:10:01,299
I mean, I'm on, there's like 200 videos in this playlist. So, I mean, and I know I just like

70
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:13,860
leaked it, but who cares? Look at this. These are kitchen appliances. Look at all these,

71
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:21,429
the Betty Crocker all in one basket, the miracle grill. You know what's crazy about infomercials?

72
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:34,379
You're on light mode. I don't know. What? He's obsessed with marketing. I'm obsessed with

73
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:43,799
direct marketing. Direct marketing is so, just so bizarre. It's such a bizarro world. What's wrong

74
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:53,399
with light mode? I can see. Do I, should I turn off light mode? This dude's a tab hoarder. Well,

75
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:58,440
it's not going to be bright because I'm about to, look, we're going in full screen. Look, we're fine.

76
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,340
It's fine. All right. So this is the fill and flavor direct response infomercial.

77
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:11,480
If you don't know what direct response is, direct response is when there is no,

78
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,080
there's no like middleman. They don't like, this is not like in Walmart. It's not in Target.

79
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:24,539
It's just manufacturer direct marketing to consumer. And it's always insane. Are you ready?

80
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:27,580
Let's just go. This is, this is the fill and flavor. I'm going to give you my thoughts. I think my

81
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:34,179
screen might be too big. Actually, why don't we just turn it off for each one? Can I? Let's go.

82
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:40,539
Okay. There we go. Fill and flavor. Do your homemade cakes look and taste the same old

83
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:46,139
fashioned, no filling, boring and plain? Well, not anymore. Now there's the fun-tastic fill

84
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:51,259
and flavor by perfect bakeware. Okay. The revolutionary cake making wonder that lets you bake,

85
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:55,980
fill and decorate. I've seen this one. It's so easy. Turn it up. Just pour in any cake mix. Lock

86
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,299
on the magic center insert. But hold on. First of all, let's before I know people get like,

87
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:13,909
stop pausing. What is this? This looks like cheese. This is Brie. What happened? Don't pause.

88
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:20,870
I'm going to be pausing. All right. I want you to do an experiment with me guys.

89
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:25,740
Every time they do a black and white, look at this person, screw something up,

90
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:33,700
or look at how bad this looks. Imagine the person is like 10 beers deep. This is just like the person

91
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:41,899
is trashed. If you think like that, it's, this makes sense. This person is shit faced and they

92
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:47,429
decided to make a cake. I'm telling you, all of them think that way. We'll, we'll, we'll stop it

93
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:53,190
each time. Boring and plain? Well, not anymore. Now there's the fun-tastic fill and flavor by

94
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:57,029
perfect bakeware. I remember so many of these too. The revolutionary cake making wonder that lets you

95
00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:02,309
bake, fill and decorate. Oh, you can do, you can do it with the kids. Pour in any cake mix. Lock on

96
00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:07,269
the magic center insert and place them in the oven. Okay. When done, remove the insert,

97
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:12,389
add your favorite filling, then cover it with the base. All right. Amazing. A wonderful cake. It's

98
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:18,230
so thrilling. It's still thrilling. Imagine their surprise when they see tasty chocolate.

99
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:24,440
That's a huge fucking feast. Who's, who's going to eat that? Is one of the kids going to eat this?

100
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:31,740
Yeah. No shit. They're surprised. It's like mom's given us the whole cake. Tasty chocolate. That's

101
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:43,460
so, that's so much. That's way too much. Chocolate pudding. I'd eat that. Yep. Oh, look at our shit

102
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:48,179
face. This person is, look at our shit face. Okay. Remember this person, it's like three o'clock in

103
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:55,450
the morning and they know they have a pie in the fridge and they're like two or three of them in

104
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:58,889
the room are like, yo pie, right dude? Oh, let's get it.

105
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:15,289
We had this. Did it work? Wait, hold on. Whose hands are these? What, what? Oh, I thought this

106
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:19,850
was a batting glove. I was like, why is, why is like a baseball player serving this? I thought

107
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:28,009
that was a fucking like golf glove. Yeah. I just made a few cakes for the boys in the locker room.

108
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:46,090
What's wrong with this one? I don't know about that one. That's actually, that's kind of cool.

109
00:14:55,690 --> 00:15:04,330
What? That's bullshit. They don't, they won't even potentially have a center filling.

110
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:09,529
What could be better than one filling flavor? Two filling flavors. That's right. You get two for the

111
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:13,690
price of one. Two? Just pay separate processing and handling. I have a question for everybody.

112
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:19,450
I've had this theory since I was like 15 or 16, whatever. So when they say, oh, and if you act now,

113
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:25,509
you get a second one free. Almost every single infomercial that you'll see on all these lists,

114
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:33,740
one of these videos, they did that. And was that just your paying for two? We just say this is how

115
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:44,649
much it costs for one. Is that, that's how that works, right? That's, that's the idea. Oh, and

116
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:50,649
remember if you get our, get this, it's, you get two for just $19.99. The price is $19.99 for this,

117
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:59,899
but you get two. So they're $10 each, right? Has to be. I don't, it could, maybe it's not,

118
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:04,490
but I'm just saying like, I remember that was a, that was a big thing. Or they'd give you other

119
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:09,220
stuff. It was like, yeah, it's $39.99 for this. And they show all the commercial, they show everything.

120
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:12,820
And all of a sudden they'll be like, but hold on a second. You also get the scissors too,

121
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:22,539
and the swimming goggles. And it's like, wait, did you just kind of, did you just sell me three

122
00:16:22,539 --> 00:16:30,389
things and just added all the prices together? That used to happen. This thing's kind of cool.

123
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:35,750
Today to order fill and flavor for $19.95 plus processing and fill and flavor.

124
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:40,950
All right. Yeah. And I, okay. Well here's the thing guys, you know,

125
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:44,549
none of these fucking, don't fucking do that. I'll be an idiot.

126
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:49,190
All right. What about the clever tongs? Spatulas and tongs have been around forever,

127
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:54,389
but try to flip and food flops, try to grip shit face. I'm telling you shit face.

128
00:16:54,389 --> 00:17:19,690
I imagine somebody sitting across the table, right? Like somebody sitting here and it's like,

129
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,609
like mom, mom, oh, they're getting like burnt.

130
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:36,329
Whoa. Actually, this is pretty cool. So it's got like a canvas.

131
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:43,609
Hammock. I got it wrong.

132
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,450
The clever tong.

133
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:57,369
Why would you want to hoist a whole pot roast? Like with your one hand.

134
00:18:00,089 --> 00:18:04,009
Flip potato cakes fast and easy right in the pan. All right. You went. All right.

135
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:09,130
I had to use it. This is actually pretty awesome.

136
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:19,819
All right. I got a question. How many of you guys have made burgers, right?

137
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:24,460
And here's the thing about pans. You ready for this? Listen to this. This is important.

138
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:30,170
I didn't know this, but like you can't use certain utensils in certain pans.

139
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:34,339
There's like a bunch of rules that I didn't know about. Like, oh, hey, yeah, you want,

140
00:18:34,339 --> 00:18:40,099
let me flip your burger with my spatula. Don't do that. Don't fucking do that.

141
00:18:40,099 --> 00:18:45,690
You're going to ruin everything. I'm like, um, what about this tool? No, that'll cause damage.

142
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:52,220
You have to use this specific tool. You have to use this specific silicone to pick that up.

143
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,759
Okay. Oh shit. I didn't know that. And I didn't know that up until like,

144
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:03,190
I would say maybe like five years ago. I did not know that chef Andy, right?

145
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:11,130
So a product like this, I'm just going to be very honest with you. I, I, I sport it because

146
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:15,609
this just works in any pan. Nobody's going to yell at you. Mom's not going to be pissed.

147
00:19:15,609 --> 00:19:18,730
You're not going to scratch anything. You're not going to be looking at how much asparagus

148
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:23,140
can fit in that, by the way. Look at how much asparagus without it falling or scoop,

149
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:27,779
lift and serve an amazing Philly cheesesteak in seconds. Clever tongs is very clever.

150
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:31,940
Two in one helper. You need to grip and flip that king sized ribeye with ease.

151
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:35,859
And by the way, guys, that was a king size ribeye, not just a regular size ribeye. That's an extra.

152
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:38,660
That's like, that's like another 70 cents for McDonald's. That's super size.

153
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,180
Flip and serve a mouthwatering grilled cheese. Scoop and flip delicately.

154
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,099
Does this still exist? I hope so. I just get it.

155
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:48,980
And then scoop and serve the potatoes with perfection.

156
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,180
What was this called? The clever tongs? Okay. That thing's actually fucking pretty good.

157
00:19:54,740 --> 00:20:01,670
I actually like, I always, okay, even with the right tool, I will always go like this.

158
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,700
Everybody does this. And don't tell me you don't because it sucks.

159
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,980
You got a spatula and you go down, you try to get under slowly

160
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:14,619
and you end up just moving the patty to the edge of the pan.

161
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:18,940
And then you end up just like kind of taking your finger and like

162
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:25,259
touching the edge and like lifting it and then letting go.

163
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:31,349
I'm so sick of doing that because like the spatulas, even the silicone ones,

164
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:34,309
they don't get under. They kind of just like push and slide.

165
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:40,490
I think I flip half of hamburgers I've ever flipped in my life.

166
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:44,569
Unless they were on a grill because a grill like don't matter.

167
00:20:44,569 --> 00:20:48,009
A grill like who cares if you're like using the right utensils.

168
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:50,329
It's just like you just take it, you fucking flip it.

169
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:52,170
You get like grease all over. It doesn't matter.

170
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:57,000
But like it sucks doing that. Target audience.

171
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:02,019
I mean, okay, I would say I would want that one.

172
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:07,849
Also back in the, we're going to just watch, this is Egg Genie.

173
00:21:09,289 --> 00:21:10,410
I'll give a preference to this though.

174
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:14,250
I don't know what it was with like the mid to late 90s and like the early 2000s

175
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,730
and like mid 2000s with eggs in the microwave.

176
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:21,299
I don't, why?

177
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:28,500
It was a huge thing. Eggs in the microwave.

178
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,190
There was so many products that did it.

179
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:34,869
It was like, oh, put your egg in this and it'll turn in a minute you'll have an egg.

180
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:38,339
Eggs don't take that long though.

181
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,180
If you just do like scrambled egg, I mean the pan.

182
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,180
Yeah, maybe you mess up the pan, you get it all dirty.

183
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,220
But there was an obsession in like the early 2000s

184
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,339
with cooking eggs in the microwave with our device.

185
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,700
Okay, hold on. Let's see. I'm curious.

186
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:08,380
That's a poached egg and it looks great.

187
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,460
That looks like a really great poached egg.

188
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,099
What do they mean?

189
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,819
Isn't that a poach? That looks good.

190
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:20,339
I would eat that to put that on a piece of toast.

191
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:22,339
That's a poached egg.

192
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:36,099
Also, I'm sure a lot of people are probably noticing the Nolan North

193
00:22:36,099 --> 00:22:39,509
of all infomercial voiceovers.

194
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:42,940
This guy introducing the egg wave.

195
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:47,319
This guy probably was, this guy probably made,

196
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:48,440
God damn, I don't know, man.

197
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,140
This guy probably made thousands of dollars an hour.

198
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,700
He would probably, he probably just the guy, like the guy.

199
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,619
He was the voice and I think he's still going.

200
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:01,380
Oh, it's not in the microwave.

201
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:16,740
Dude.

202
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,059
Nice.

203
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:27,299
I thought it was, all right, that's kind of cool.

204
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:31,299
I thought it was going to be a, they're fine.

205
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:39,619
But it's like a bug zapper.

206
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,900
Oh, don't mind that.

207
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,180
It's just the bugs being zapped.

208
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:48,180
Because when you turn it upside down, it's also a bug zapper indicator.

209
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:52,420
Like shut off and continuous audible signal that prevents overcooking.

210
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,900
Now it's a breeze to stick to your diet with quick

211
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,380
and easy locale snacks that always taste.

212
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,420
That's kind of cool.

213
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,299
Egg Genie also comes with its own steamer tray.

214
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:01,619
All right.

215
00:24:03,619 --> 00:24:04,180
Okay.

216
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:04,900
All right.

217
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,380
You got me.

218
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,299
Wait, what are they giving us?

219
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:15,700
There it is.

220
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,180
The bacon wave.

221
00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:30,099
All right.

222
00:24:30,099 --> 00:24:30,500
All right.

223
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,170
Everything had to be a genie too.

224
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:34,410
Yeah.

225
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:36,539
Okay.

226
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:38,140
So let me tell you what I think about this.

227
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:38,940
I'm into it.

228
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:44,619
I thought this is going to be a microwave thing, but I, that was unfair.

229
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:50,009
It's just a steamer that has one setting probably, right?

230
00:24:50,009 --> 00:24:54,859
But I mean, that's, I probably would have used this.

231
00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:00,099
The thing about all these products, these kind of like direct marketing products,

232
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:05,299
the problem with a lot of them was they kind of really only did one thing.

233
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:12,250
They just did one thing and they always made a point to like,

234
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:16,890
Oh, you have so much bullshit on your counter and so much dog shit in your pantry.

235
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:21,059
This is just, this is like, it's just a steamer that has one setting.

236
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:25,000
They always made a point about this, how you had too much bullshit,

237
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,539
but they were just trying to sell you a product that like was, did one thing.

238
00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:31,380
Although I would say I probably would have used this

239
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,339
because cooking hard eggs actually is a pain in the ass,

240
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:35,460
but I wouldn't want to microwave them.

241
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,420
Steaming them sounds pretty interesting.

242
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,299
I've never done that before.

243
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:39,319
That sounds good.

244
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:43,930
That's actually pretty cool.

245
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:45,509
I'm into it.

246
00:25:45,509 --> 00:25:49,819
I have not seen one that I've been like, no, no, thanks.

247
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:50,380
There's a lot.

248
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:52,140
This is so much fun.

249
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:52,859
I love this.

250
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:54,140
This is like the funnest thing ever.

251
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:55,099
Okay.

252
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,720
How about the perfect slicer?

253
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,519
Slicers are weird.

254
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:07,880
All right.

255
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,000
First of all, I made this reference like two months ago and there it is.

256
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,559
That's a Gallagher reference and I'm so glad that you got to see it.

257
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,059
Careful.

258
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:35,740
Bro, what the fuck?

259
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,059
I want watermelon, dude.

260
00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:39,180
Get in there.

261
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,789
I'm fucking trying, dude.

262
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:41,109
Sucks.

263
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:45,190
Just imagine you hear the word bro like three times in the corner.

264
00:26:46,869 --> 00:26:47,750
You fucking do it.

265
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:53,430
Dude.

266
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,230
That thing's scary.

267
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:58,710
Just don't hold the knife like this.

268
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,230
It's not like a fucking lightsaber.

269
00:27:13,829 --> 00:27:14,630
Cantaloupe sucks.

270
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,230
I kind of got hold on.

271
00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:21,430
Wait a minute here.

272
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:26,470
This is kind of, I kind of got, that kind of got messed up.

273
00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:32,549
What?

274
00:27:32,549 --> 00:27:33,269
I don't like cantaloupe.

275
00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:42,069
They should have leaned way heavier into that.

276
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:46,470
Yeah, they should have.

277
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:46,710
Yeah.

278
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:47,269
Lean into that.

279
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:54,390
120 perfect delicious slices.

280
00:27:55,109 --> 00:27:57,269
Oh, I thought the guy did it 120 times.

281
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:06,869
I thought it was like we made this guy do this 150 times and he said it was easy.

282
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:17,720
Another thing I want you to pay attention to and look for here is something technology.

283
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,269
Keep an eye on that.

284
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:24,329
They would say like two or three words and then add technology to the end

285
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:28,009
and it was supposed to be like oh wow that's like a scientist had to have come up with that.

286
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:34,250
Advanced freshness technology.

287
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,990
What is advanced freshness technology?

288
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:41,140
What's the, what is the tech behind that?

289
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:41,779
Technology.

290
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:44,839
Advanced freshness.

291
00:28:47,509 --> 00:28:47,910
I don't know.

292
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,029
I think the, I think the cutting thing is cool.

293
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,670
You know how many times I've actually had like a cake or something?

294
00:28:58,869 --> 00:28:59,430
Go now.

295
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:00,950
Or pineapple too.

296
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,470
That'd be like pineapple just cut but I don't know.

297
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,829
I feel like I'd be kind of scared to do that.

298
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:05,319
Wouldn't you?

299
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:08,599
Going like this and like pushing because the thing might be wobbling around.

300
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:09,960
I might be kind of scared to do that.

301
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,599
All right.

302
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:16,279

But never at home is a pain.

00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:38,519

00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:24,680
So that every fry is cooked to the perfect temperature and texture.

332
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,079

I get what they're going for here but.

378
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:50,700
If you go to the if you go to the freezer aisle in your grocery store.

379
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,619
And you get frozen fries.

380
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:58,069
Like what the orida has like a frozen bunch of stuff right.

381
00:31:58,069 --> 00:31:59,190
Those are good.

382
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,390

00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:02,940
Those taste great.

384
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,819
They have like the fast food like shoestring style.

385
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:07,430
They're great.

386
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:10,059
You just put them out on the on a pan.

387
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:12,940
You put it in the oven like whatever.

388
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,460
Have a long like 15 minutes or so.

389
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,579
It's it tastes it's good.

390
00:32:15,579 --> 00:32:16,220
It's really good.

391
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:16,700
They're great.

392
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:20,359
It's like they do it fast.

393
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:22,440
But is it really that fast though?

394
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,099
Because you have to cut the potato.

395
00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:31,420
And I think I feel like going from potato.

396
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:35,099
Like I got to go get a potato and like wash it and like clean it.

397
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:36,619
And then put it here and then cut it.

398
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:37,900
I feel like that's too much.

399
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,900
I'm not sure I would be into this product.

400
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,019

I was going to say how much pasta was that?

425
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,539
Love delicious pasta.

426
00:33:35,539 --> 00:33:39,529

Tick tock voice.

437
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:02,089
I've actually.

438
00:34:02,089 --> 00:34:04,730
My mother used to make zucchini noodle soup.

439
00:34:06,009 --> 00:34:07,690
It was fucking fire.

440
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:08,090
It was good.

441
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:14,489
Okay.

442
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:20,969
Okay.

443
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:22,250
I get it.

444
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:25,610
But that's not all.

445
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:25,929
What else?

446
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:29,130
What?

447
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:31,690
I thought that was an onion.

448
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:31,929
Okay.

449
00:34:33,849 --> 00:34:34,570
All right.

450
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:34,889
All right.

451
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:44,570
I'm sorry.

452
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:48,090
This is cool but like totally just looks like a mess.

453
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,599
That's a big deal.

454
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:56,920
Okay.

455
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,119
That's what I was concerned about.

456
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,119
I was concerned about that.

457
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,519
I get the idea.

458
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:09,320
It's an interesting idea.

459
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,440
Picky eaters.

460
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:20,760
Pesto.

461
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,000
Oh this is ribbon slicing now.

462
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:27,960
Fettuccine or curly lasagna.

463
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,039
Ribbon cut cucumbers for salad.

464
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:31,400
You can eat and more.

465
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,599
As a bonus you'll also.

466
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,110
That kind of looks gross.

467
00:35:37,909 --> 00:35:44,059
It looks like a salad with way too much dressing on it.

468
00:35:48,389 --> 00:35:48,869
All right.

469
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:49,750
It doesn't do apples.

470
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:49,909
Right.

471
00:35:49,909 --> 00:35:50,230
Okay.

472
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:53,590
So it's like a peeler essentially but a little more involved.

473
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,070
I'm into it.

474
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,030
I think it's cool.

475
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,949
I think that's fine.

476
00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:00,860
Yeah.

477
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:02,619
Okay.

478
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:04,539
If you've had this on the counter.

479
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:08,599
And I like I can't either came you've not invited me to your house.

480
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:10,519
Something like oh hey dude like come on I'll come over.

481
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:11,239
I'm like oh I'll come over.

482
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:12,199
This sounds fun.

483
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:15,239
So I get there and I like put my backpack down and I put my baseball cap down.

484
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,039
And I sit on the couch or whatever and you say oh hey look what I got.

485
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:21,320
I've got the Vigetti.

486
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,889
I'd look over and I'd be like whoa let's do it.

487
00:36:24,889 --> 00:36:25,289
Let's go.

488
00:36:25,289 --> 00:36:25,690
Let's do it.

489
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:25,929
Let's do it.

490
00:36:25,929 --> 00:36:26,409
That'd be fun.

491
00:36:26,409 --> 00:36:28,409
Like that'd be the fun thing that we would do.

492
00:36:28,409 --> 00:36:32,380
And like that I would have a good time doing that I think.

493
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,980
I think it'd be fun to do that.

494
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:36,489
Why do you have a backpack on?

495
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,190
No it's not.

496
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,469
Not a grinder date.

497
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,019
Okay.

498
00:36:53,019 --> 00:36:53,900
Fuck that.

499
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,019
I'm out of here.

500
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:58,920
All right the Vigetti Pro I give it a fucking seven.

501
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,199
What about the perfect pancake?

502
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:01,639
You flip but they flop.

503
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:03,320
You flip but they flop.

504
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,760
Now your pancakes are a mess.

505
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,719
Oh wait wait wait wait.

506
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:06,840
You flip but they.

507
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,119
Okay remember.

508
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,619
Shit faced.

509
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:13,139
You flip but they flop.

510
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:14,820
You flip but they flop.

511
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,500
Now your pancakes are a mess.

512
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,820
And all that butter and fat to cook them.

513
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,500
There's got to be a better way.

514
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,619
Hi Mark Gill here.

515
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:23,380
If I was trashed I would love those.

516
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,900
The fast easy spatula.

517
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,500
Yeah there was a million of these.

518
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,420
There was so many of these.

519
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:32,179
Watch just close the handle and flip it.

520
00:37:32,179 --> 00:37:33,139
Yes.

521
00:37:33,139 --> 00:37:36,980
Portland ground pancakes with no mess and no added fat.

522
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,780
The reason is this double-sided non-stick surface.

523
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:43,619
That's so slippery not even burnt on cheese will stick to it.

524
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:46,579
Flip delicious blueberry fluffy apple cinnamon.

525
00:37:46,579 --> 00:37:49,300
Or four mouth-watering buttermilk flapjacks.

526
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:49,619
Yeah.

527
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:52,659
Fast easy and without ever using a spatula.

528
00:37:52,659 --> 00:37:56,260
If you can turn a doorknob you can use the burnt on cheese.

529
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,099
They always use that as an example.

530
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,699
But watch what happens with the perfect pancake pan.

531
00:38:01,699 --> 00:38:03,340
Eggs over easy.

532
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:03,820
All right.

533
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,179
Ever breaking a yolk.

534
00:38:05,179 --> 00:38:05,739
Amazing.

535
00:38:05,739 --> 00:38:07,019
All right that was kind of cool.

536
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:08,059
Gingerbread pancakes.

537
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:12,860
Fluffy cranberry or mountains of chocolate chip pancakes for the kids in an instant.

538
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:16,780
You can also make delicious dessert crepes or four healthy egg sandwiches.

539
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,820
Oh egg sandwiches.

540
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,380
Just like from a restaurant.

541
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,539
Why flip and flop one at a time.

542
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:25,820
Call now and make four perfect pancakes at the same time.

543
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,340
All right I don't know why.

544
00:38:28,059 --> 00:38:28,780
I just imagine.

545
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:36,199
Okay pan the camera up and there's a person with a lit cigarette in their mouth.

546
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:38,199
And it's only like half left.

547
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:40,840
And they're just like sitting there with they're just smoking.

548
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:43,000
That's I just see a cigarette.

549
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,440
I see like just a lit cigarette.

550
00:38:46,579 --> 00:38:48,460
Time call now.

551
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,500
Slimesicle welcome.

552
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,840
Thanks for the raid.

553
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,400
Welcome everybody.

554
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,599
We're doing product reviews.

555
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,760
Infomercial product reviews.

556
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,639
Hope you had a good stream.

557
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:56,280
Welcome.

558
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,849
This was the pancakes all at once.

559
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:00,889
I don't even know what this was called.

560
00:39:01,769 --> 00:39:02,650
But thanks.

561
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:06,420
Welcome.

562
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,579
Four perfect pancakes at the same time with the perfect pancake pan.

563
00:39:10,579 --> 00:39:12,260
And our fast and fluffy recipe.

564
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,300
Everything was 1995.

565
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:20,739
If you had a product back in like the mid-2000s or early kind of early 2000s and late 90s.

566
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,460
And your product was less or more than 1995.

567
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,690
You lost board members.

568
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:26,969
Executives would leave.

569
00:39:26,969 --> 00:39:33,030
Now and we'll double your order free.

570
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,789
Just pay separate shipping and handling.

571
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:35,030
All right.

572
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,670
Yeah that's all right.

573
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,070
Let's go.

574
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:38,579
What about this one?

575
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:39,940
All right here we go.

576
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,059
Mighty meatballs.

577
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:45,349
This one is going to be interesting.

578
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:45,829
Mark Gill.

579
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:52,550
I trust him.

580
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,269
Four delicious meatballs at once.

581
00:40:01,269 --> 00:40:02,309
It's so simple.

582
00:40:02,309 --> 00:40:05,989
And believe me if you tried to make stuffed meatballs without one.

583
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:07,349
Stuffed meatballs.

584
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:08,469
All you do is.

585
00:40:08,469 --> 00:40:09,429
That was huge.

586
00:40:09,429 --> 00:40:10,949
That was a fucking softball.

587
00:40:11,989 --> 00:40:13,429
Who's making that?

588
00:40:13,429 --> 00:40:13,989
Wait a minute.

589
00:40:13,989 --> 00:40:14,389
Wait a minute.

590
00:40:14,389 --> 00:40:14,789
Wait a minute.

591
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:15,989
That was a softball.

592
00:40:15,989 --> 00:40:17,900
There's going to be a big.

593
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,940
Oh I swear to God.

594
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,780
Grandma's Italian meatballs.

595
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,219
Holy shit.

596
00:40:24,219 --> 00:40:28,409
Two up to seal.

597
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:31,530
Mighty meatball makes four large stuffed meatballs every time.

598
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,090
That was a big.

599
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:33,369
I smell that.

600
00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:33,849
I've been out there.

601
00:40:42,489 --> 00:40:43,289
I don't know about that.

602
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:45,769
I don't know about that.

603
00:40:45,769 --> 00:40:46,409
I don't know about that.

604
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:53,849
I get the stuffed burger thing but stuffed meatballs.

605
00:40:53,849 --> 00:40:54,650
I'm not so sure.

606
00:40:57,219 --> 00:40:58,900
Bacon, mac and cheese, meatballs.

607
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,739
I feel like this is a kid's menu.

608
00:41:00,739 --> 00:41:02,340
Is this the kid's menu?

609
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:06,739
Stuffed ground chicken with ham and swiss for cordon bleu that just can't miss.

610
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:11,940
Or use ground turkey with stuffing and cranberry sauce for the best turkey meatballs ever.

611
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,780
And it's not just for meatballs.

612
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,179
Make cheesy garlic stuffed mashed potatoes.

613
00:41:16,179 --> 00:41:16,980
Yeah this is like.

614
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:20,789
What the fuck?

615
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:26,019
I get it.

616
00:41:26,019 --> 00:41:26,820
I get the idea.

617
00:41:29,139 --> 00:41:30,340
What about easy butter?

618
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:39,130
Loves butter but getting it out of the fridge out of the wrap onto your food is a real asshole.

619
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:40,650
Introducing easy butter.

620
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:44,010
Okay the problem was not the butter.

621
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:48,650
The problem was you leaving your toast in the toaster for like 40 minutes.

622
00:41:53,849 --> 00:41:55,369
All right this is fucking awesome actually.

623
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:01,780
Holy shit.

624
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,820
This is awesome.

625
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,420
What?

626
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,179
All right do they still make this?

627
00:42:15,139 --> 00:42:15,780
That's insane.

628
00:42:28,099 --> 00:42:29,380
Am I insane for liking this?

629
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,019
Okay this is an incredible product I think.

630
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:43,059
You don't want your like five-year-old daughter saying that by the way.

631
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:44,739
You don't want to.

632
00:42:45,699 --> 00:42:48,760
All right you know where's the vegetables?

633
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,480
Where are the vegetables?

634
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,639
Where's the zucchini slicer?

635
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:52,860
Where's the zucchini slicer?

636
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:53,739
We need that back.

637
00:42:53,739 --> 00:42:55,400
Where's the zucchini slicer?

638
00:43:06,489 --> 00:43:06,969
What is that?

639
00:43:08,889 --> 00:43:09,690
Who's doing that?

640
00:43:14,809 --> 00:43:15,769
I like this though.

641
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:21,289
But with your order today we'll double the offer.

642
00:43:21,289 --> 00:43:22,329
All right so that's five dollars.

643
00:43:25,849 --> 00:43:26,329
Cheese?

644
00:43:26,969 --> 00:43:28,090
Wait there's more?

645
00:43:31,449 --> 00:43:32,730
Why would you put a hot dog in there?

646
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:34,489
Hold on.

647
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:43,130
A hot dog?

648
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:47,429
Why would you put a hot dog in there for little kids?

649
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:49,909
But like just it's like fun to I mean.

650
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,639
Slicing a hot dog is not as difficult as slicing cold butter.

651
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:56,539
Bananas?

652
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:01,500
Cutting the hot dog is simple.

653
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,900
I could cut a hot dog up in like literally five seconds.

654
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,980
It's just like one, two, three, four, five.

655
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:08,780
It's not a big deal.

656
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:09,579
Cutting butter is hard.

657
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,159
All right that's pretty sick.

658
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,599
I'd say of all the products we've seen of like the ten we've seen.

659
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:18,360
I like that one the most.

660
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,440
I want an easy eggwich.

661
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,579
Okay the other steam products.

662
00:44:51,539 --> 00:44:52,659
Didn't need to go in the microwave.

663
00:44:56,659 --> 00:44:57,460
Was it the Egg Genie?

664
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,260
That's kind of thick too.

665
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:22,340
Okay.

666
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:24,739
It's easy though.

667
00:45:24,739 --> 00:45:26,099
It's simple whatever.

668
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:33,380
And that was another thing too.

669
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,579
Why were people so obsessed with this too?

670
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,019
Help me with this.

671
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,260
Oh and cooking in oil.

672
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,460
No one wants to do that.

673
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:47,050
Olive oil is like fucking not bad for you.

674
00:45:47,849 --> 00:45:49,610
Cooking in like an olive oil?

675
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:50,730
Like a light olive oil?

676
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,949
Don't and then think about how much oil you'll be using.

677
00:45:56,949 --> 00:45:59,960
What was like the the war on fat?

678
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:00,760
Like fats?

679
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:02,940
No no no no no.

680
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:04,460
Don't have those omega-3s.

681
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,579
Don't eat them.

682
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:06,619
Don't touch those.

683
00:46:06,619 --> 00:46:11,260
That's look we're gonna have a tray that all the oil drips into this tray.

684
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:12,139
And then don't eat that.

685
00:46:12,139 --> 00:46:13,420
That's that's disgusting.

686
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:16,550
How vile.

687
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:19,269
Oil's like a good oil like an olive oil.

688
00:46:19,269 --> 00:46:20,469
Like sunflower oil.

689
00:46:20,469 --> 00:46:23,110
This stuff is not bad for you.

690
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:24,230
It's not bad for you.

691
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:25,909
It's actually has a lot of benefits.

692
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:34,940
Olive oil is fantastic for you.

693
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:36,059
But not essential oil.

694
00:46:37,739 --> 00:46:39,340
Sunflower oil is bad.

695
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:42,070
I'm talking about yeah but I said olive oil.

696
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:42,869
Avocado oil.

697
00:46:42,869 --> 00:46:45,750
You have you ever cooked with avocado oil before?

698
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:48,150
Have you cooked with like a good olive oil?

699
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:50,309
It's like it adds to your food.

700
00:46:50,309 --> 00:46:51,190
Doesn't take away from it.

701
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:56,889
Carbs are killer.

702
00:46:56,889 --> 00:46:58,170
Peanut oil is amazing.

703
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:01,210
Yeah dude what is with this war on like oil?

704
00:47:02,809 --> 00:47:03,449
I don't get that.

705
00:47:03,449 --> 00:47:04,969
In a cabinet so many.

706
00:47:06,179 --> 00:47:08,579
But put butter all over everything.

707
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:11,210
I love butter oil.

708
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:15,110
Oh it's oil.

709
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:17,269
That's even the word oil.

710
00:47:17,989 --> 00:47:19,989
It's like it would come out of the ground.

711
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:21,750
What's going on here?

712
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:24,309
All here in the one minute easy eggwich recipe guy.

713
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:26,309
And they always show like eating steaks.

714
00:47:26,309 --> 00:47:30,440
Oh it can even flip a eight pound steak.

715
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,360
Don't cook it in that disgusting oil.

716
00:47:33,539 --> 00:47:34,260
I don't get it.

717
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:38,340
Now give your family a hot fresh breakfast in one minute with easy eggwich.

718
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:39,380
Call now and get.

719
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:40,019
All right we get it.

720
00:47:41,179 --> 00:47:41,900
Nah I wouldn't get it.

721
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,019
I wouldn't buy that one.

722
00:47:43,019 --> 00:47:44,650
How about burrito perfect?

723
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,619
Love burritos but hate the mess.

724
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:56,300
You fill fold and roll but could never get that perfect hold.

725
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:56,780
That's true.

726
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:59,019
And store-bought burritos are just not the same.

727
00:47:59,019 --> 00:47:59,500
That's true.

728
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,179
Introducing burrito perfect.

729
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:04,139
The simple fast mess-free way to make perfect burritos.

730
00:48:04,139 --> 00:48:05,260
What is this?

731
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:05,900
Watch.

732
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,420
It's a t-shirt holder.

733
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:08,460
Burrito perfect.

734
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:13,340
Fill it with your favorite toppings such as rice, beans, chicken, lettuce, cheese,

735
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:14,460
and guacamole.

736
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:19,420
Then fold one, two, three, and you get a perfect burrito with ease.

737
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:21,980
Now you can make quick and simple breakfast burritos.

738
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,420
Steak fajita burritos.

739
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:24,699
Chicken and cheese burritos.

740
00:48:24,699 --> 00:48:26,059
It's a t-shirt holder.

741
00:48:26,059 --> 00:48:27,099
Vegetable burritos.

742
00:48:27,099 --> 00:48:27,739
But what if you-

743
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:29,179
Okay I use-

744
00:48:29,179 --> 00:48:30,539
I always overfill.

745
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:32,139
What the fuck?

746
00:48:33,099 --> 00:48:33,500
Hold on.

747
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:36,059
Your family will enjoy making their own favorite burrito.

748
00:48:36,059 --> 00:48:36,699
Huh?

749
00:48:36,699 --> 00:48:37,659
There's nothing in there.

750
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:39,099
There's nothing in there.

751
00:48:39,099 --> 00:48:40,780
They're making their own favorite burrito.

752
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,650
There's nothing in there.

753
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:48,760
There's nothing in here.

754
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,239
You know without the mess all by themselves.

755
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:52,519
She said this is just a tortilla.

756
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:57,400
No more frustration folding burritos and worrying about getting it on your clothes.

757
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,840
Enjoy making your own fresh flavorful burrito without the spills.

758
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,840
Burrito perfect is also great for-

759
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,880
Yeah but okay.

760
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:04,599
Okay listen.

761
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:08,539
When you make a burrito, I don't care who you are.

762
00:49:08,539 --> 00:49:11,510
I don't care what your food preferences are.

763
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:13,980
I don't give a shit.

764
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,659
You always put way too much in.

765
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:18,219
Because you go, oh yeah give me some ground beef.

766
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:19,590
A little bit more.

767
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:21,510
I think I need a little bit kind of hungry.

768
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:24,119
And the ground beef is like a mound this high.

769
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:26,039
Uh I want like shredded lettuce in this.

770
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:26,840
Like shredded lettuce.

771
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:27,400
Shredded lettuce.

772
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,789
Shredded lettuce.

773
00:49:28,789 --> 00:49:29,269
Tomato.

774
00:49:29,269 --> 00:49:29,989
Like tomato chunks.

775
00:49:29,989 --> 00:49:30,389
Tomato chunks.

776
00:49:30,389 --> 00:49:31,190
A little bit of salsa.

777
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:32,389
Oh I got a-

778
00:49:32,389 --> 00:49:35,179
Is there enough room for cheese in here?

779
00:49:35,179 --> 00:49:36,619
Uh yeah I'll put some cheese on it too.

780
00:49:36,619 --> 00:49:37,179
Like a lot.

781
00:49:37,179 --> 00:49:39,219
I want a lot of cheese on this.

782
00:49:39,219 --> 00:49:40,340
And then you go, this is not rolling.

783
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:41,539
This is never gonna roll.

784
00:49:41,539 --> 00:49:43,219
I'm never gonna have this be a burrito.

785
00:49:43,219 --> 00:49:45,940
So I'm just gonna put my hands underneath it and like kind of cup it.

786
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:47,860
And eat it like a folded pizza slice.

787
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,960
So this product would never work for me.

788
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:52,760
Ever.

789
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,630
Because there's not enough in here.

790
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:55,739
I-

791
00:49:55,739 --> 00:49:56,380
There's not enough.

792
00:49:58,659 --> 00:50:02,170
This is not a substantial burrito for me.

793
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:02,730
Like a taco.

794
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:03,289
Yeah like-

795
00:50:03,289 --> 00:50:08,010
Like fold it up and eat it like a soft taco.

796
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:08,570
I-

797
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:10,090
Kids might have fun with this though right?

798
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,210
If you use this for-

799
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:12,730
Because look a kid's not gonna-

800
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:14,570
Oh hey roll a burrito son!

801
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:15,769
That's four years old.

802
00:50:16,699 --> 00:50:17,420
And they're gonna be like-

803
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:17,920
I-

804
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:20,280
My head!

805
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,179
AHHHHHH!

806
00:50:22,179 --> 00:50:24,500
And they're gonna start fucking crying and it's gonna be a disaster.

807
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,219
So I mean like this-

808
00:50:26,219 --> 00:50:27,500
You can make like little-

809
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,539
Pancake pastries and burritos and stuff be fine right?

810
00:50:30,539 --> 00:50:31,579
I can see it.

811
00:50:31,579 --> 00:50:32,460
For crepes!

812
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:34,219

813
00:50:34,219 --> 00:50:35,420
Chocolate banana crepes,

814
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:37,019
Peach crepes and more!

815
00:50:37,019 --> 00:50:39,260
What a mistake not leading with that.

816
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:43,179
For a limited time you'll get the burrito perfect for only $9.99!

Hate holding the taco shell and mess in your hand?

Use the grape for once.

820
00:50:49,659 --> 00:50:52,940
Now just place your taco shell in the taco holder and fill it with meat,

821
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:53,980
Topped with lettuce,

822
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:54,860
Shredded cheese,

00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,059

These incredible office gear...

837
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:28,960
Stop.

838
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:32,059
Okay.

839
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:34,230
You saw easy butter.

840
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:36,619
Perfect brownie.

841
00:51:36,619 --> 00:51:40,219
Alright, perfect brownie is an automatic absolute buy for me.

842
00:51:41,079 --> 00:51:43,219
Because you get edges.

843
00:51:43,219 --> 00:51:44,420
It gives you edges.

844
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:47,429
You'll see what I mean.

845
00:51:47,429 --> 00:51:48,949
Cut, rip, and tear.

846
00:51:48,949 --> 00:51:51,349
But your brownies never turn out square.

847
00:51:51,349 --> 00:51:53,670
And when they're stuck, you're totally out of luck.

848
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:54,170
No.

849
00:51:54,949 --> 00:51:56,070
You have to throw the pan away.

850
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:57,190
Now you're talking about the brownie pan!

851
00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:00,489
The new non-stick way to bake, slice, and serve perfect brownies!

852
00:52:00,489 --> 00:52:01,449
That whole pan's gotta go.

853
00:52:01,449 --> 00:52:02,170
You try it.

854
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:03,929
Just pour in your favorite batter.

855
00:52:03,929 --> 00:52:04,570
Insert the diffuser...

856
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:04,969
Yup.

857
00:52:04,969 --> 00:52:06,010
Everything gets an edge.

858
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:06,570
Yeah, come on.

859
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:09,530
...18 chocolatey brownies sliced all at once.

860
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:10,250
The reason?

861
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:13,369
The unique design and durable non-stick coating.

862
00:52:13,369 --> 00:52:16,090
Not even 18 marshmallow treats will stick.

863
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:16,809
And look!

864
00:52:16,809 --> 00:52:18,650
The bottom and sides separate.

865
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:20,329
So anytime it goes on this rack...

866
00:52:20,329 --> 00:52:20,829
Wha...

867
00:52:20,829 --> 00:52:23,449
...perfect brownie becomes the sweetest party serving term.

868
00:52:23,449 --> 00:52:24,809
Anime voiceover?

869
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:27,369
Serve crazy top brownies for birthdays.

870
00:52:27,369 --> 00:52:28,090
Marvel swirl for graduation.

871
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:29,530
I mean, I was gonna say, it sounds like kind of like...

872
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:32,809
Delicious double fudge brownies at your very own bake sale.

873
00:52:32,809 --> 00:52:33,769
Cha-ching!

874
00:52:33,769 --> 00:52:34,250
Oh no!

875
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:34,969
Cha-ching!

876
00:52:34,969 --> 00:52:39,510
This pan which bakes eats brownies.

877
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:40,630
It looks so fucked up!

878
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:43,590
Someone ate all the edges again.

879
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:45,670
No, a raccoon got in the house.

880
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:48,739
So I would throw the whole thing away.

881
00:52:50,409 --> 00:52:52,329
That's not like, oh, dad!

882
00:52:52,329 --> 00:52:57,130
Dad ate all the edges that an animal got in your house.

883
00:52:57,130 --> 00:53:00,460
And I don't know if this is probably not standard here to eat this.

884
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:01,420
The solution?

885
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:04,679
Design which bakes each brownie separately.

886
00:53:04,679 --> 00:53:07,880
So they're moist inside and chewy outside.

887
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:11,639
If you can make ice cubes, you can use Perfect Brownie Pan.

888
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:12,679
Now stack them for ice cubes and sandwiches...

889
00:53:12,679 --> 00:53:14,199
Yeah, no, these are better.

890
00:53:14,199 --> 00:53:16,280
These are way better than doing it in a regular pan.

891
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:16,760
It just is.

892
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,000
...holidays, anniversaries, or barbecues.

893
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,199
Just bake, slice, and serve without ever using a knife.

894
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:25,619
It's a gimmick product, but it does what it's supposed to do.

895
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:31,940
Perfect Brownie Pan comes with the gooey and chewy recipe guide for the amazing low price of just $19.95.

896
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,699
And it's not just for brownies.

897
00:53:33,699 --> 00:53:38,179
Make fluffy cakes, awesome bar cookies, or Grandma's Apple Pie Squares.

898
00:53:38,179 --> 00:53:39,460
Grandma's Apple Pie Squares.

899
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:43,380
Smart shoppers receive these decorative stencils to make listive treats,

900
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:48,179
like flags on the Fourth of July, or transform any dessert into a work of art.

901
00:53:48,179 --> 00:53:49,139
Oh, that's kind of cool.

902
00:53:49,139 --> 00:53:52,019
You'll get the complete Perfect Brownie Pan with Divider,

903
00:53:52,019 --> 00:53:56,340
Starbucks, ten stencils, and recipe guide for only $19.95.

904
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:57,530
That's right.

905
00:53:59,110 --> 00:53:59,429
Cool.

906
00:53:59,429 --> 00:53:59,750
All right.

907
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:01,750
That one, that's a classic.

908
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:02,309
All right.

909
00:54:02,309 --> 00:54:05,349
The Chop Magic, the Go-Grill.

910
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:07,940
All right.

911
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:08,500
I don't know.

912
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:11,480
I kind of like, I haven't watched all of them.

913
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,750
I just watch every single one of these.

914
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,349
All right, let's do the Chop Magic.

915
00:54:15,349 --> 00:54:22,420
And first of all, we got, first of all, this is important.

916
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:25,139
We've got Mark Gill here, which is automatic.

917
00:54:25,139 --> 00:54:29,829
Like this product, I'm interested already, already, right off the bat.

918
00:54:29,829 --> 00:54:32,630
Hi, Mark Gill here with the Chop Magic.

919
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:37,909
You're going to love the way this beauty can chop, mince, slice, and dice in just seconds.

920
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:41,829
Chopping vegetables the old way takes forever.

921
00:54:41,829 --> 00:54:42,070
Yeah.

922
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,829
It's tough work and such a mess.

923
00:54:43,829 --> 00:54:44,150
Yeah.

924
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:45,510
Well, not with Chop Magic.

925
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:45,750
Okay.

926
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:50,389
Go ahead, chop a whole onion in one second, no odor and no tears.

927
00:54:50,389 --> 00:54:50,630
Okay.

928
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:54,070
Chili and pepper, squash and zucchini in just three seconds.

929
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:54,389
You got it.

930
00:54:54,389 --> 00:54:56,469
That's a stir fry that makes other choppers cry.

931
00:54:56,469 --> 00:54:57,510
And it's safe too.

932
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:59,429
It's strong enough to go through solid sweet.

933
00:54:59,429 --> 00:54:59,670
All right.

934
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:04,710
So here's why the other thing where it was the big like Dark Souls wheel, like weapon,

935
00:55:05,429 --> 00:55:08,550
like pushing that down with the blades and shit.

936
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:11,159
This is has safety in mind.

937
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:12,840
You get it on the blade.

938
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:16,039
You line it up and you're not going to touch it.

939
00:55:16,039 --> 00:55:18,940
It's not going to you.

940
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,539
The little prongs up top.

941
00:55:20,539 --> 00:55:22,150
That's good.

942
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:22,630
I like that.

943
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:24,230
I like that a lot.

944
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:25,030
Yeah.

945
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:28,070
Easily chopped delicate tomatoes to perfection.

946
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:29,590
Now make fresh egg salad.

947
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:32,789
Healthy coleslaw needs to be pre-cut in no time.

948
00:55:32,869 --> 00:55:33,349
That's it.

949
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:39,829
What's wrong with that?

950
00:55:45,989 --> 00:55:47,829
I mean, they're all cubes though, right?

951
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:56,019
Presentation wise, everything is a ham cube.

952
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:56,500
Everything.

953
00:55:57,059 --> 00:56:00,599
Everything is a ham cube.

954
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:04,840
So, I mean, presentation wise, maybe not, but practical, I think so.

955
00:56:05,639 --> 00:56:10,519
Instantly prepare fresh fruit salads, zesty salsa, or a mountain of garlic without it

956
00:56:10,519 --> 00:56:11,159
sticking to your head.

957
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:13,239
Somebody called me an infomercial centrist.

958
00:56:13,239 --> 00:56:16,570
You can say it sucks.

959
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:20,650
Did you not hear me talk about the fucking microwave one, the one with the eggs?

960
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:22,409
I was like, nah, I don't think so.

961
00:56:22,409 --> 00:56:24,920
What do you mean infomercial centrist?

962
00:56:27,739 --> 00:56:29,579
I'm being honest and being very thorough.

963
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:31,420
I'm being very thorough.

964
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:37,739
Yeah, but nobody, nobody, dishwashers, nobody uses dishwasher.

965
00:56:40,739 --> 00:56:42,739
I use my dishwasher.

966
00:56:42,739 --> 00:56:48,300
I've run my dishwasher because otherwise it'll get gross.

967
00:56:49,579 --> 00:56:51,500
I wash by hand.

968
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:55,510
I don't like that idea of take, oh yeah, there's like a bunch of

969
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:58,710
fucking like salsa and like mess on my plate.

970
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:00,469
Just stick it in here and turn the water on.

971
00:57:00,469 --> 00:57:02,780
No, I don't like the dishwasher.

972
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:04,519
I don't like it.

973
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:07,300
And you know, I also, I don't like the dishwasher.

974
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,380
All the people question marking me right now.

975
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:13,380
So you enjoy putting like your dishes in this thing.

976
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:18,340
And then like, for like at least one to two fucking hours, you hear.

977
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:27,059
It's fucking obnoxious.

978
00:57:27,699 --> 00:57:28,659
It's obnoxious.

979
00:57:28,659 --> 00:57:34,170
And it lasts for an hour, an hour, two fucking hours of this.

980
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:39,139
You can, I can wash a whole fucking sink of dishes in 20 minutes.

981
00:57:39,139 --> 00:57:41,059
Dishwashers are just loud, annoying.

982
00:57:41,059 --> 00:57:43,380
They take way too long, a bunch of water.

983
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,579
No, no, no, no.

984
00:57:44,579 --> 00:57:47,780
Sometimes I'll use it if I need to, you know, no, never.

985
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:49,820
Sounds like your dishwasher sucks.

986
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:51,500
Your dishwasher is broken.

987
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:56,329
What are you talking about?

988
00:57:56,329 --> 00:58:02,360
Your dishwasher is fucked up.

989
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:05,699
That's impossible.

990
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:06,340
No, it's not.

991
00:58:07,219 --> 00:58:08,630
No, it's not possible.

992
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:11,670
I don't use it.

993
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:14,170
They're not that loud normally.

994
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:15,369
I don't use this.

995
00:58:15,369 --> 00:58:17,690
How would the dishwasher be broken if it was, if I never use it?

996
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:26,500
That's a huge amount of food.

997
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:30,630
All right.

998
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:30,949
Cool.

999
00:58:30,949 --> 00:58:31,989
Chop magic is pretty cool.

1000
00:58:31,989 --> 00:58:32,389
I like it.

1001
00:58:32,949 --> 00:58:34,010
All right.

1002
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:34,889
What about the go grill?

1003
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:39,559
Yep.

1004
00:58:50,329 --> 00:58:51,610
Holy shit.

1005
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:53,769
Can you imagine seeing somebody do this?

1006
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:01,400
You don't want to, you try to load

1007
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:05,559
your backyard grill into the trunk of your car.

1008
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:10,789
Where are you taking this?

1009
00:59:11,349 --> 00:59:12,389
Where are you taking this?

1010
00:59:14,949 --> 00:59:15,269
Bugs.

1011
00:59:16,889 --> 00:59:18,889
But honestly, I, yeah, no.

1012
00:59:25,429 --> 00:59:25,670
Okay.

1013
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:34,789
All these sound effects.

1014
00:59:38,789 --> 00:59:38,949
Okay.

1015
00:59:38,949 --> 00:59:45,269
You know, your product is really kind of just boring where you can't just show it.

1016
00:59:45,269 --> 00:59:48,630
You have to have like lasers and whooshing sounds.

1017
00:59:54,869 --> 00:59:57,269
Or I'm going to give the credit to the editor here.

1018
00:59:57,269 --> 01:00:01,590
The person editing, I would love God, if I could have, I could pick like a job.

1019
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:04,949
I think it'd be perfect sitting in the editing room

1020
01:00:04,949 --> 01:00:09,019
and just kind of laughing to yourself and being like, yeah, I'm going to put,

1021
01:00:09,019 --> 01:00:10,619
yeah, I'm going to put like whooshing sounds here.

1022
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:12,139
It's going to be funny.

1023
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:14,889
I guarantee you they do that.

1024
01:00:16,969 --> 01:00:17,769
There's no way they don't.

1025
01:00:19,289 --> 01:00:21,050
That sounds like a fun like thing to do.

1026
01:00:27,369 --> 01:00:28,329
But only if they win.

1027
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:32,090
Or grill a seafood delight when you go to the beach.

1028
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:34,170
It's a must for camping food delight.

1029
01:00:37,349 --> 01:00:38,630
Why is this image so weird to me?

1030
01:00:41,829 --> 01:00:43,909
This is a strange image for some reason.

1031
01:00:43,909 --> 01:00:47,880
Why?

1032
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:48,679
I can't figure out.

1033
01:00:49,639 --> 01:00:52,539
It's because they're all facing the same direction.

1034
01:00:52,539 --> 01:00:53,260
Yeah.

1035
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:59,860
All of them are facing this way and the water is the other way

1036
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:02,980
and you can't put the cameras in the water.

1037
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:07,460
So this image just looks bizarre.

1038
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:10,340
Like they don't want to go back to go where the water is.

1039
01:01:11,539 --> 01:01:12,420
This isn't a beach.

1040
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:13,300
Wait, what is this?

1041
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:19,559
He just said beach.

1042
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:24,579
I also feel like this guy is way far away from these two.

1043
01:01:24,579 --> 01:01:26,739
I feel like they did a weird camera thing with this guy

1044
01:01:26,739 --> 01:01:32,630
is actually like 50 feet in front of them.

1045
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:35,909
It's a must for camping or when you go RV.

1046
01:01:35,909 --> 01:01:37,269
And it's perfect for the boat.

1047
01:01:37,269 --> 01:01:38,389
When you go fishing.

1048
01:01:38,389 --> 01:01:41,590
This low profile fold away grill tucks away almost any.

1049
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:42,389
Oh, I got a bite.

1050
01:01:42,389 --> 01:01:43,110
Hey, hold on a second.

1051
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:45,909
I got four chicken breasts on a grill.

1052
01:01:45,909 --> 01:01:46,230
Hold on.

1053
01:01:46,949 --> 01:01:49,030
Oh, you went in the water over in a rowboat?

1054
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:49,510
Be careful.

1055
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:51,110
It's perfect when space is tight.

1056
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:54,389
Your go grill can make 12 burgers sizzle all at once

1057
01:01:54,389 --> 01:01:56,630
or grill 24 hot dogs for an incredible.

1058
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:57,590
No, that doesn't work.

1059
01:01:57,590 --> 01:01:59,429
If you're the guy that likes baby bags,

1060
01:01:59,429 --> 01:02:02,230
the go grill can handle a full man-sized rack.

1061
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:04,630
The go grill will feed your full man-sized grill.

1062
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:06,469
Oh, full man-sized.

1063
01:02:06,469 --> 01:02:08,150
We got man-sized portions.

1064
01:02:08,789 --> 01:02:09,739
You know what I mean?

1065
01:02:11,079 --> 01:02:12,519
Yeah, it's the whole rack.

1066
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,980
Which you'll eat maybe a third of it.

1067
01:02:17,289 --> 01:02:19,289
And then be like, I don't really want any more of this.

1068
01:02:19,289 --> 01:02:21,289
And I have a man-sized portion.

1069
01:02:21,289 --> 01:02:22,329
You throw it away.

1070
01:02:22,329 --> 01:02:23,610
But man-sized though.

1071
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:25,619
Make sure that's for men.

1072
01:02:25,619 --> 01:02:28,739
The go grill will feed your family and all of your friends.

1073
01:02:28,739 --> 01:02:30,019
What do you like to grill?

1074
01:02:30,019 --> 01:02:31,619
Chicken, steak, or lobster?

1075
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:33,059
The list never ends.

1076
01:02:33,059 --> 01:02:36,019
The go grill is the most unique grill you'll ever own.

1077
01:02:36,019 --> 01:02:37,300
Take it anywhere you go.

1078
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:38,260
Okay.

1079
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:42,119
If I was at a barbecue and I walked up to the person

1080
01:02:42,119 --> 01:02:44,840
that was like, you know, operating the grill and the grill master.

1081
01:02:45,579 --> 01:02:48,460
I was like, oh, yeah, I guess they're ready.

1082
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:48,699
Yeah.

1083
01:02:48,699 --> 01:02:49,579
Oh, yeah, they're ready.

1084
01:02:49,579 --> 01:02:51,260
You want a man-sized portion?

1085
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:56,150
I'd be like, no.

1086
01:02:57,460 --> 01:02:58,739
Ah, sure.

1087
01:02:58,739 --> 01:03:00,099
It's like four patties.

1088
01:03:00,099 --> 01:03:01,619
Like, no, I don't want them.

1089
01:03:01,619 --> 01:03:03,300
No, just guys, a regular one.

1090
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:05,500
Can I just have a regular hamburger?

1091
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,800
Just regular steak?

1092
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:10,199
Like, I don't want a man-sized portion.

1093
01:03:10,199 --> 01:03:11,239
Join me at home.

1094
01:03:11,239 --> 01:03:11,880
I don't thank you.

1095
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,599
You might expect to pay up to $100 for a grill this versatile.

1096
01:03:14,599 --> 01:03:17,880
But if you call now, your go grill is only $19.99.

1097
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:18,380
$19.99?

1098
01:03:19,579 --> 01:03:20,380
What the fuck did you say?

1099
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:24,630
Go grill only $19.99.

1100
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:27,079
What a fuck-up.

1101
01:03:27,079 --> 01:03:29,719
That's a major fuck-up.

1102
01:03:30,519 --> 01:03:33,380
Order not this 11-piece stainless steel tool.

1103
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:34,500
I thought this was drill bits.

1104
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:36,099
Separate processing and handling.

1105
01:03:36,099 --> 01:03:41,619
That's an $80 value all for the incredible low price of only $19.99.

1106
01:03:45,079 --> 01:03:45,400
Okay.

1107
01:03:46,039 --> 01:03:48,780
I will give a positive here.

1108
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:51,989
Here's the one positive.

1109
01:03:51,989 --> 01:03:53,510
There are tons of portable grills.

1110
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:54,309
There are.

1111
01:03:54,309 --> 01:03:55,190
There's tons of them.

1112
01:03:55,829 --> 01:04:01,210
A portable grill is actually not a, it's actually pretty cool.

1113
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:09,849
I would actually rather cook at my home on a portable grill than the huge,

1114
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:15,960
gigantic grill that needs a bunch of maintenance.

1115
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:19,880
So I would actually rather one of these than like a real huge grill.

1116
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:20,280
I don't know.

1117
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:21,480
That's just like a lot.

1118
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,610
I also don't like propane.

1119
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:27,050
It scares the shit out of me because just a fucking bunch of gas pressurizes.

1120
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:29,130
You know how I feel about like pressurized gas and stuff.

1121
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:31,050
So I don't like using propane.

1122
01:04:31,050 --> 01:04:31,769
I like charcoal.

1123
01:04:32,329 --> 01:04:33,449
And charcoal is a mess.

1124
01:04:33,449 --> 01:04:36,519
Yeah, that one's cool.

1125
01:04:39,659 --> 01:04:39,980
Okay.

1126
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,179
Big top cupcake.

1127
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:44,519
Perfect meatloaf.

1128
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:46,119
I'm very curious about perfect meatloaf.

1129
01:04:49,429 --> 01:04:51,190
A flipjack pan.

1130
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:54,809
Charcoal is the devil's fruit.

1131
01:05:07,239 --> 01:05:09,849
Rip meatloaf.

1132
01:05:09,849 --> 01:05:10,650
Charcoal is.

1133
01:05:11,369 --> 01:05:16,550
Do you want to play postal four?

1134
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:17,909
I don't, I have no plan to do that.

1135
01:05:20,519 --> 01:05:21,320
Perfect meatloaf.

1136
01:05:25,559 --> 01:05:27,159
No, I'm doing a big top cupcake.

1137
01:05:27,159 --> 01:05:27,960
Cakes aren't cool.

1138
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:31,099
Why do tiny cupcakes take so long to make?

1139
01:05:31,099 --> 01:05:32,699
This one's frame rate is bad.

1140
01:05:32,699 --> 01:05:33,900
Big top cupcake.

1141
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:34,539
The fast and.

1142
01:05:34,539 --> 01:05:35,739
We've got this other voice though.

1143
01:05:36,219 --> 01:05:37,420
Cupcakes that are up to.

1144
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:38,139
What the fuck.

1145
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:42,619
Everyone's face will light up when you make a king size cupcake house.

1146
01:05:42,619 --> 01:05:47,019
Grab your camera to remember those giant cupcakes your family makes together.

1147
01:05:47,019 --> 01:05:48,059
It's so easy.

1148
01:05:48,059 --> 01:05:49,579
Just fill with any cake mix.

1149
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:51,659
It's like 100p.

1150
01:05:51,659 --> 01:05:53,739
That jumbo cupcake looks amazing.

1151
01:05:53,739 --> 01:05:54,300
This is a cake.

1152
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:58,139
Big top's quick release silicone is flexible and virtually nothing sticks.

1153
01:05:58,139 --> 01:05:59,420
It's just a cake though.

1154
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:03,179
Pops out every time making it the ultimate party activity.

1155
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:06,539
Mix and match delicious flavors like strawberry and chocolate.

1156
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:09,579
Oh, what?

1157
01:06:09,579 --> 01:06:13,980
More thrilling than a chocolate filling made easy with our magic center insert.

1158
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:16,619
Fill big tops with pudding, mousse, gelatin.

1159
01:06:16,619 --> 01:06:18,300
Okay, it's a different product.

1160
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:23,260
Tiny cupcakes won't do, but 25 times bigger feeds the whole crew.

1161
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:24,539
No one's going to eat all of it though.

1162
01:06:25,739 --> 01:06:26,619
I might.

1163
01:06:26,619 --> 01:06:27,119
Okay.

1164
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:31,340
I know, they keep saying that.

1165
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:32,539
They keep saying that.

1166
01:06:34,219 --> 01:06:36,300
Store-bought cakes are so expensive.

1167
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:36,860
Are they?

1168
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:38,139
I don't, I feel like they're not.

1169
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:44,119
It's a man-sized cupcake.

1170
01:06:44,119 --> 01:06:47,079
Is a cupcake, is a cake that you can buy just at like the store,

1171
01:06:47,079 --> 01:06:50,679
like the grocery store, that expensive?

1172
01:06:50,679 --> 01:06:53,960
I thought that that was like a really good cheap option, isn't it?

1173
01:06:54,519 --> 01:06:56,019
I don't think they're cheap.

1174
01:06:56,019 --> 01:06:57,300
They're not that expensive.

1175
01:06:58,099 --> 01:07:00,260
They're like 10, they're like 15 bucks.

1176
01:07:04,469 --> 01:07:06,630
Oh, it's, it's a, it's a hundred dollars.

1177
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:07,829
Like what, a hundred?

1178
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:10,389
Where are you buying these cakes?

1179
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:14,579
Yeah, they're like 10 to 20 dollars, aren't they?

1180
01:07:14,579 --> 01:07:21,460
But you can join the show now with Big Top Cupcake for the amazingly low price of $19.95.

1181
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:23,139
It's a man-sized cupcake.

1182
01:07:23,699 --> 01:07:26,980
And to make decorating easy, we'll include this idea book free.

1183
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:28,260
I love the sound effects.

1184
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:29,860
Where is it?

1185
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:32,420
Here it comes right, where is it?

1186
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:35,380
A few quick steps, fill, bake, and decorate.

1187
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:37,460
Store-bought cakes are so expensive.

1188
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:38,019
Where is it?

1189
01:07:38,019 --> 01:07:40,579
Cake mold stick and cost over $35.

1190
01:07:40,579 --> 01:07:41,780
This is like an explosion sound.

1191
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:45,380
You can join the show now with Big Top Cupcake for the amazingly low price.

1192
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:45,699
There it is.

1193
01:07:45,699 --> 01:07:45,860
Okay.

1194
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:49,460
It won't do, but 20 tiny cupcakes won't do, but.

1195
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:53,800
That's so stupid.

1196
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:57,480
That's so gross.

1197
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:58,280
I wouldn't want that.

1198
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:02,090
But you got to remember like the kid factor, right?

1199
01:08:02,949 --> 01:08:07,860
Kids, a big cupcake to a kid is holy shit.

1200
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:09,780
This is a huge deal to a kid.

1201
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:13,420
So a lot of these are like for kids or for seniors.

1202
01:08:13,739 --> 01:08:17,020
You got to keep that in mind.

1203
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:17,340
All right.

1204
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:17,899
That was cool.

1205
01:08:17,899 --> 01:08:19,180
What about a perfect meatloaf?

1206
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:20,619
I think chat's ready for this one.

1207
01:08:20,619 --> 01:08:22,699
Is that crumbly meatloaf a pain to serve?

1208
01:08:22,699 --> 01:08:25,979
Do you hate all the oil, grease, and fat it cooks in?

1209
01:08:25,979 --> 01:08:27,260
There's got to be a better way.

1210
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:29,020
Hi, it's Mark.

1211
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:32,359
Hate all.

1212
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:32,760
Did you?

1213
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,840
Why is there more than like two pizzas worth of grease here?

1214
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:37,479
What's going on?

1215
01:08:38,409 --> 01:08:40,250
Grease and fat it cooks in?

1216
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:41,529
There's got to be a better way.

1217
01:08:42,409 --> 01:08:44,729
Hi, it's Mark with the perfect meatloaf pan.

1218
01:08:44,729 --> 01:08:48,890
The new nonstick way to bake, lift, and serve delicious meatloaf.

1219
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:49,529
Watch.

1220
01:08:49,529 --> 01:08:51,130
Just prepare your favorite loaf.

1221
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:53,689
Place it on this tray and pop it in the oven.

1222
01:08:53,689 --> 01:08:56,970
When done, simply lift the handles and presto.

1223
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:59,770
Out comes the entire meatloaf all at once.

1224
01:08:59,770 --> 01:09:00,489
The reason?

1225
01:09:00,489 --> 01:09:03,130
The unique design and durable nonstick coating.

1226
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:04,649
We haven't gotten the technology.

1227
01:09:05,529 --> 01:09:08,409
Other pans force your meal to sit in a bowl of fat.

1228
01:09:08,409 --> 01:09:09,609
No, it doesn't do that.

1229
01:09:10,569 --> 01:09:13,369
Those same nasty fat drippings stay at the bottom of the pan.

1230
01:09:13,369 --> 01:09:15,369
Okay, what kind of ground beef is this?

1231
01:09:15,369 --> 01:09:16,859
Who wants that?

1232
01:09:16,859 --> 01:09:18,539
This is not 80-20 ground beef.

1233
01:09:18,539 --> 01:09:22,779
This is like 60-40 ground beef.

1234
01:09:22,779 --> 01:09:27,020
With perfect meatloaf, those same nasty fat drippings stay at the bottom of the pan.

1235
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:29,659
And oh my god.

1236
01:09:29,659 --> 01:09:32,619
Elevated lifting tray with over 60 drain holes.

1237
01:09:32,619 --> 01:09:36,300
Fat drippings can drain through the holes and collect in the space below

1238
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:39,420
where they won't get reabsorbed back into the meatloaf.

1239
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:42,140
Lift and serve delicious French onion meatloaf.

1240
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:45,659
Savory stuffed Italian or moist bacon cheeseburger.

1241
01:09:45,659 --> 01:09:48,380
Perfectly Italian and with all the extra fat.

1242
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:49,340
Meatloaf sucks.

1243
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:50,380
But it's not just for meatloaf.

1244
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:51,899
Baked sticky pecan rolls that lift right out of the pan.

1245
01:09:51,899 --> 01:09:52,939
Meatloaf sucks.

1246
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:53,420
It just does.

1247
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:56,939
Or roast and serve soft stuffed peppers without them ever falling apart.

1248
01:09:56,939 --> 01:09:57,420
Holiday serves.

1249
01:09:57,420 --> 01:10:01,260
There's only one meatloaf I've ever had that I liked and it was my mother's meatloaf.

1250
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:03,260
Nobody else makes it this good.

1251
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:07,109
And I'll tell you, let's be really honest with each other here.

1252
01:10:07,109 --> 01:10:08,869
I don't like your mother's meatloaf.

1253
01:10:08,869 --> 01:10:11,270
I like my mother's meatloaf.

1254
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:15,579
Nobody likes another mother's meatloaf.

1255
01:10:15,579 --> 01:10:17,850
I don't like your mother's meatloaf.

1256
01:10:17,850 --> 01:10:20,010
I don't, I'm like, no, I don't like this.

1257
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:23,369
But if my mom makes it, it's like, mom, it's fantastic.

1258
01:10:24,489 --> 01:10:27,689
Why is that?

1259
01:10:27,689 --> 01:10:30,729
Yeah, your mother's meatloaf is the only good meatloaf.

1260
01:10:31,289 --> 01:10:33,050
Even other mother's meatloafs are not good.

1261
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:36,970
Perfect meatloaf pan is a tremendous value at just $14.95.

1262
01:10:36,970 --> 01:10:38,170
But I'm not done.

Thick or thin, you'll always win.

1266
01:10:44,890 --> 01:10:45,289
I like that.

1267
01:10:45,289 --> 01:10:46,729
$20 value, free.

1268
01:10:46,729 --> 01:10:48,250
But I'm not stopping there.

1269
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:51,050

1270

Just pay separate fucking.

1271

Hold on a second, I need to, we gotta get, we gotta get that.

1272
01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:00,810
$20 value, free.

1273
01:11:01,529 --> 01:11:04,569
But I'm not stopping there.

1274
01:11:04,569 --> 01:11:05,449
Collar click.

1275
01:11:07,989 --> 01:11:10,149
That was, that was like violent.

1276
01:11:10,149 --> 01:11:12,390
Right this minute and we'll double your order.

1277
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:14,310
Just pay separate processing and handling.

1278
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:14,949
I love this guy.

1279
01:11:14,949 --> 01:11:16,630
That's right, you get two perfect meatloaf pans.

1280
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:17,670
$14.95.

1281
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:19,750
They're undercutting everybody.

1282
01:11:24,069 --> 01:11:24,869
You get two of them?

1283
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:26,659
Okay.

1284
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:27,939
All right.

1285
01:11:27,939 --> 01:11:32,229
That's not bad.

1286
01:11:32,229 --> 01:11:33,989
All right, bacon fill.

1287
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:35,670
I think we saw that one already, right?

1288
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:37,720
Flip jack pan.

1289
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:42,420
We'll do the flip jack pan.

1290
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:44,340
Pancakes are a pain to flip.

1291
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:46,819
And half the time they burn and stick.

1292
01:11:46,819 --> 01:11:47,779
Not anymore.

1293
01:11:47,779 --> 01:11:48,420
Introducing.

1294
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:49,539
It's the same design.

1295
01:11:49,539 --> 01:11:51,140
It's the same fucking design.

1296
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:51,699
Greenick.

1297
01:11:51,699 --> 01:11:52,180
The easy.

1298
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:53,300
It's the like turn it.

1299
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:53,859
With flapjacks.

1300
01:11:53,859 --> 01:11:54,659
It's the turn it.

1301
01:11:54,659 --> 01:11:56,979
Or Greenick ceramic cookwares revolutionized non-stick.

1302
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:57,619
Sick effect.

1303
01:11:57,619 --> 01:12:00,420
So now with flip jack, just add your favorite batter,

1304
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:02,420
close the lid, then flip the pan.

1305
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:04,739
You'll have perfect full-sized flapjacks.

1306
01:12:04,739 --> 01:12:05,539
And check this out.

1307
01:12:05,539 --> 01:12:07,859
We're going to burn a bunch of mozzarella cheese on it

1308
01:12:07,859 --> 01:12:09,939
and it's proof that we can scrape it out into the trash.

1309
01:12:09,939 --> 01:12:11,300
So there's less mess or dress.

1310
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:11,859
Wait for it.

1311
01:12:11,859 --> 01:12:13,859
Forget about clumsy spatulas.

1312
01:12:13,859 --> 01:12:15,779
Your Greenick flip jack is so easy.

1313
01:12:15,779 --> 01:12:17,779
You'll flip pancakes with just one hand,

1314
01:12:17,779 --> 01:12:19,619
then slide them right out of the pan.

1315
01:12:19,619 --> 01:12:21,619
The secret is the dual hinge cooking design

1316
01:12:21,619 --> 01:12:23,460
with our Greenick ceramic surface.

1317
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:24,579
Nothing ever sticks.

1318
01:12:24,579 --> 01:12:25,220
What the fuck?

1319
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:28,979
Burned on cheese slides right off with no...

1320
01:12:28,979 --> 01:12:29,380
Thank you.

1321
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:30,739
I get a point.

1322
01:12:32,199 --> 01:12:36,149
Um, the, the, what, design.

1323
01:12:36,149 --> 01:12:37,189
Right out of the pan.

1324
01:12:37,189 --> 01:12:39,510
The secret is the dual hinge cooking design with...

1325
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:40,949
Dual hinge cooking technology.

1326
01:12:40,949 --> 01:12:42,710
They're not using technology anymore.

1327
01:12:42,710 --> 01:12:43,350
What year is this?

1328
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:44,949
The Greenick ceramic surface.

1329
01:12:44,949 --> 01:12:46,310
Nothing ever sticks.

1330
01:12:46,310 --> 01:12:49,430
Even burned on cheese slides right off with no scrubbing.

1331
01:12:49,430 --> 01:12:51,270
You'll make hot and tasty blueberry

1332
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:53,430
or a stack of buttermilk in seconds.

1333
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:56,069
And the kids will love this chocolate chip surprise.

1334
01:12:56,069 --> 01:12:57,510
Oh, I would love that.

1335
01:12:57,510 --> 01:13:00,949
Close the lid, then flip for full-size fantastic flapjacks.

1336
01:13:00,949 --> 01:13:02,630
All without using a spatula.

1337
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:04,550
Does this ever happen to you?

1338
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:05,350
Not with flipjack.

1339
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:06,149
Actually, yeah.

1340
01:13:06,149 --> 01:13:07,750
Over-easy eggs are a cinch.

1341
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:10,229
And best of all, no broken yolks.

1342
01:13:10,229 --> 01:13:13,109
So call now to get the flipjack pancake pan.

1343
01:13:13,109 --> 01:13:16,550
Here's some inside information from Betty Crocker.

1344
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:17,829
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1345
01:13:17,829 --> 01:13:18,310
Don't tell me.

1346
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:19,739
Don't tell me.

1347
01:13:19,739 --> 01:13:20,859
Don't tell me.

1348
01:13:20,859 --> 01:13:23,829
I don't want to know this insider info.

1349
01:13:24,789 --> 01:13:27,189
What if I want to buy shares in Betty Crocker?

1350
01:13:27,189 --> 01:13:29,260
Don't fucking tell me this.

1351
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:30,539
Hey, I got insider info.

1352
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:32,539
But don't fucking come near me.

1353
01:13:32,539 --> 01:13:33,579
Get away from me.

1354
01:13:33,579 --> 01:13:36,939
The most exciting thing you can do with the inside of a cake.

1355
01:13:36,939 --> 01:13:39,739
Introducing the Betty Crocker bacon fill.

1356
01:13:39,739 --> 01:13:42,939
A delightful new pan that lets you take care of cake.

1357
01:13:42,939 --> 01:13:44,699
Do we see this already?

1358
01:13:44,699 --> 01:13:47,579
Imagine the look on your child's face when you cut into the cake.

1359
01:13:47,579 --> 01:13:50,060
And there's his favorite flavor of ice cream.

1360
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:51,340
Her favorite gelatin.

1361
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:53,899
And who wouldn't enjoy a cake filled with delicious,

1362
01:13:54,539 --> 01:13:57,020
no secret is these three separate sections.

1363
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:58,220
Then we already did this.

1364
01:13:58,220 --> 01:14:01,180
The same one into the main bacon.

1365
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:03,899
This is a different commercial for this special inner chamber.

1366
01:14:03,899 --> 01:14:07,899
Now pour more cake mix into this base pan and put them both into.

1367
01:14:07,899 --> 01:14:08,859
Yeah, we've already seen this one.

1368
01:14:08,859 --> 01:14:09,819
Remove the insert.

1369
01:14:09,819 --> 01:14:11,579
Add your filling to the center cavity.

1370
01:14:11,579 --> 01:14:12,060
What is that?

1371
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:14,380
Cover it with a base in no time.

1372
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:16,699
You'll have the greatest cake you ever made.

1373
01:14:16,699 --> 01:14:20,699
Making an exciting cake with my Betty Crocker bacon fill is so easy.

1374
01:14:20,699 --> 01:14:21,979
And everything's nonstick.

1375
01:14:21,979 --> 01:14:23,500
So there's no messy cleanup.

1376
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:26,779
These are the kind of desserts you'll find in the finest restaurants.

1377
01:14:26,779 --> 01:14:30,539
Ice cream cakes, Italian filled torts, even baked Alaska.

1378
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:34,380
What is baked Alaska?

1379
01:14:36,090 --> 01:14:44,520
Wait, what the fuck is baked Alaska?

1380
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,319
That's scary.

1381
01:14:45,319 --> 01:14:48,840
Or you can simply fill your cake with a different Betty Crocker cake mix.

1382
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:49,960
Just fill the inner chamber.

1383
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:51,479
Baked Alaska is on fire?

1384
01:14:51,479 --> 01:14:53,800
Now make all your cakes extra special.

1385
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,159
Make them Betty Crocker bacon filled cakes.

1386
01:14:55,159 --> 01:14:56,439
I didn't know that.

1387
01:14:56,439 --> 01:14:59,960
You'll get the bacon fill pan, the inner chamber, and the base pan.

1388
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:03,159
Complete with instructions and Betty Crocker recipes.

1389
01:15:03,159 --> 01:15:04,119
All for only $90.

1390
01:15:04,119 --> 01:15:06,920
I don't think it's supposed to be like a raging campfire.

1391
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:07,880
Or your money back.

1392
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:11,859
All right, we saw this one already.

1393
01:15:11,859 --> 01:15:12,899
Brownie Derby.

1394
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:20,250
All right, Brownie Derby sounds pretty great.

1395
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:23,109
Boring desserts that just fall flat.

1396
01:15:23,109 --> 01:15:23,750
There's only one.

1397
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:32,119
Juicing the Brownie Derby.

1398
01:15:32,119 --> 01:15:36,300
The incredible Brownie Bowl maker that looks like a hat.

1399
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:44,180
This, in my opinion, 100% what I believe was a different product.

1400
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:49,979
That somebody on the board was just like, can we fill it with brownie mix?

1401
01:15:52,949 --> 01:15:53,750
I think so.

1402
01:15:54,789 --> 01:15:58,550
This is, I don't, this looks, this seems like a bizarre product.

1403
01:15:58,550 --> 01:16:05,029
But first of all, this is not a boring dessert.

1404
01:16:05,029 --> 01:16:08,060
This is not enough for three kids.

1405
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:15,140
If there were three brownies on this plate, they would be cheering.

1406
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:16,020
Brownies are amazing.

1407
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:16,899
This is only one.

1408
01:16:25,529 --> 01:16:27,050
Five nights at Freddy's thing.

1409
01:16:30,329 --> 01:16:31,449
What the fuck?

1410
01:16:31,449 --> 01:16:32,329
But who cares?

1411
01:16:35,029 --> 01:16:35,989
Okay, who cares?

1412
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:50,140
I mean, if you need something to cook a brownie in, then fine.

1413
01:16:51,670 --> 01:16:52,149
That's fine.

1414
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:54,649
But it's not cool.

1415
01:17:02,279 --> 01:17:02,520
Okay.

1416
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:07,640
But if you want a brownie that has a hole in it to put ice cream in it, then that makes sense.

1417
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:10,500
That's the only thing that they had.

1418
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,500
It's not like a fun toy.

1419
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:14,260
Like they're trying to make, it's just a thing that has a hole.

1420
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:15,220
It's a brownie with a hole in it.

1421
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:21,899
Like this makes sense.

1422
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:31,739
But our man-sized brownie bowl.

1423
01:17:39,539 --> 01:17:40,260
Why do they?

1424
01:17:43,529 --> 01:17:44,409
The same shot.

1425
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:47,770
Is it the same company?

1426
01:17:47,770 --> 01:17:48,329
It probably is.

1427
01:17:49,289 --> 01:17:50,329
It's the same company.

1428
01:17:50,329 --> 01:17:50,649
Probably.

1429
01:17:50,649 --> 01:17:51,130
It has to be.

1430
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,319
Also, another thing that I have an issue with.

1431
01:18:02,279 --> 01:18:03,079
They always show.

1432
01:18:04,439 --> 01:18:11,739
I don't think this brownie was $80.

1433
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:21,260
I would be surprised if this was like a $50 to $80 brownie.

1434
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:23,659
Unless you're at like the fucking weed store.

1435
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:26,300
Is this an edible brownie?

1436
01:18:30,489 --> 01:18:35,930
Well, dad, you sent in the wrong footage because that is $20 for it.

1437
01:18:35,930 --> 01:18:38,890
I mean, that's not out of the ordinary, I don't think.

1438
01:18:49,289 --> 01:18:50,090
The weed store.

1439
01:18:50,729 --> 01:18:51,449
What the fuck?

1440
01:18:51,449 --> 01:18:52,409
Whose camera is that?

1441
01:18:52,409 --> 01:18:52,970
Is it a kid?

1442
01:19:01,529 --> 01:19:02,170
They knew.

1443
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:03,449
This was, what year was this?

1444
01:19:03,449 --> 01:19:05,130
This was probably like 2005.

1445
01:19:06,409 --> 01:19:07,289
They knew it was coming.

1446
01:19:18,979 --> 01:19:20,500
Oh, the tip the hat.

1447
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:21,779
I like that.

1448
01:19:21,779 --> 01:19:22,899
That was a nice touch.

1449
01:19:22,899 --> 01:19:29,029
That was a nice touch.

1450
01:19:29,029 --> 01:19:31,000
Yeah, that was a nice touch.

1451
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,039
Now, how about magic meal?

1452
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:44,149
I don't know.

1453
01:19:44,149 --> 01:19:45,670
It's so bit rate is so bad.

1454
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:46,310
I can't even tell.

1455
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:52,069
Spaghetti.

1456
01:19:59,350 --> 01:20:03,590
All right, but I got to be centrist Andy here.

1457
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:05,270
I got to be centrist Andy.

1458
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:06,310
I got to be a centrist.

1459
01:20:12,789 --> 01:20:14,069
I wouldn't put clams in the microwave.

1460
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:18,310
I don't think so.

1461
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:19,909
I don't think so.

1462
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:25,350
I don't think so.

1463
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:26,869
Plus store leftovers in the fridge.

1464
01:20:26,869 --> 01:20:29,510
And by the way, does it have to look like a fucking urn?

1465
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:31,350
Easy reheating and it's dish.

1466
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:32,949
Like it just looks like an urn.

1467
01:20:32,949 --> 01:20:33,989
Frozen to defrost.

1468
01:20:33,989 --> 01:20:36,149
Oh, what?

1469
01:20:36,149 --> 01:20:38,630
Imagine perfectly cooked juicy chicken

1470
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:39,909
right from your microwave.

1471
01:20:39,909 --> 01:20:41,909
Simply unlock and twist.

1472
01:20:41,909 --> 01:20:43,189
What the fuck?

1473
01:20:43,189 --> 01:20:44,710
Right from the bottom veggies.

1474
01:20:44,710 --> 01:20:46,229
It's like the right crunch.

1475
01:20:46,229 --> 01:20:49,029
Enjoy healthy fish and hearty nutritious soups.

1476
01:20:49,029 --> 01:20:50,869
Even rinse and serve a healthy salad.

1477
01:20:50,869 --> 01:20:52,149
I have no commentary for this one.

1478
01:20:52,149 --> 01:20:55,750
Amazing five piece magic meal for just $19.99.

1479
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:57,510
Plus get the recipe book.

1480
01:20:57,510 --> 01:21:00,149
All right, there is no fucking way.

1481
01:21:04,180 --> 01:21:07,220
Like that chicken has been like browned on the outside.

1482
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:11,659
That's impossible in a microwave.

1483
01:21:11,659 --> 01:21:12,939
You can't, that can't happen.

1484
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:17,670
In minutes?

1485
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:18,869
What do you mean in minutes?

1486
01:21:18,869 --> 01:21:20,069
No, this didn't happen in there.

1487
01:21:20,069 --> 01:21:36,899
Okay, I have, I have a way to be centrist dandy on this one.

1488
01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:45,399
You buy this for $19.95 and it sits in your cupboard.

1489
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:47,500
You don't ever use it.

1490
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:53,479
You never touch it unless you get a call from grandma or call from mom.

1491
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:55,899
Oh, hey, mom.

1492
01:21:56,699 --> 01:21:57,739
Oh, hey, sweetie.

1493
01:21:58,460 --> 01:21:59,819
We'll be over in 15 minutes.

1494
01:21:59,819 --> 01:22:01,260
We thought we'd stop by.

1495
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:07,510
And we figured maybe we'd have dinner at your place tonight.

1496
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:11,189
Raw chicken, pasta, raw pasta, water.

1497
01:22:11,189 --> 01:22:13,909
Stick the fucking urn in the microwave in 15 minutes.

1498
01:22:13,909 --> 01:22:17,100
10 minutes, whatever it is.

1499
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:20,500
And by the time they pull up, get that out of there.

1500
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:21,619
Get it out, get it on a plate.

1501
01:22:21,619 --> 01:22:22,979
Make sure it's like, okay, good.

1502
01:22:23,699 --> 01:22:25,399
Hi, guys.

1503
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:30,920
Try the amazing five piece magic meal for just $19.99.

1504
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:33,960
Plus get the recipe book with dozens of delicious meals.

1505
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:36,600
Order in the next 10 minutes and we'll double your order.

1506
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,039
And we're still not finished.

1507
01:22:38,039 --> 01:22:40,760
Okay, but most people only have one microwave.

1508
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:43,380
Who has two microwaves?

1509
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:48,100
This thing, obviously from the commercial, fills the whole microwave.

1510
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:52,899
Did anybody have more than one microwave in their house or in their apartment?

1511
01:22:52,899 --> 01:22:55,300
Like who has like two full-size microwaves?

1512
01:22:55,300 --> 01:23:01,300
Just do it, but you can't just dump this out and clean it and do it again.

1513
01:23:03,449 --> 01:23:04,970
And we're still not finished.

1514
01:23:04,970 --> 01:23:06,970
We'll include the little red chef.

1515
01:23:06,970 --> 01:23:10,329
Great for onions, eggs, garlic, salsa, and more.

1516
01:23:10,329 --> 01:23:12,329
A $15 value, free.

1517
01:23:12,329 --> 01:23:13,369
You get it all.

1518
01:23:13,369 --> 01:23:15,689
Two five-piece deluxe magic meals.

1519
01:23:15,689 --> 01:23:17,050
Two gourmet recipe books.

1520
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:18,649
And the handy food chopper.

1521
01:23:18,649 --> 01:23:20,810
A whopping $75 value.

1522
01:23:21,850 --> 01:23:23,609
Oh, I know you can do with the other one.

1523
01:23:23,609 --> 01:23:25,289
You can use this as an urn.

1524
01:23:25,289 --> 01:23:27,130
For just $19.99.

1525
01:23:27,130 --> 01:23:29,210
We're so sure you'll love magic meal.

1526
01:23:29,210 --> 01:23:31,289
But if you don't agree, simply return it.

1527
01:23:31,289 --> 01:23:32,729
But keep the food chopper as-

1528
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:35,109
Oh, Jesus.

1529
01:23:35,109 --> 01:23:36,390
Hi, Billy Mays here for-

1530
01:23:36,390 --> 01:23:37,270
Oh, Billy Mays.

1531
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:39,750
Billy Mays.

1532
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:41,899
Oh, fucking legend.

1533
01:23:44,949 --> 01:23:45,989
Big city sliders.

1534
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:58,020
Fucking God.

1535
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:02,100
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1536
01:24:04,359 --> 01:24:04,859
What?

1537
01:24:07,930 --> 01:24:09,289
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1538
01:24:09,289 --> 01:24:11,449
Everybody back up and everybody shut up for a second.

1539
01:24:12,579 --> 01:24:13,300
This is not-

1540
01:24:13,859 --> 01:24:18,659
I've seen products like this where you-

1541
01:24:18,659 --> 01:24:20,659
Oh, look, you make perfect little patties.

1542
01:24:22,489 --> 01:24:23,529
But then you have to cook them.

1543
01:24:24,090 --> 01:24:26,170
This is a pan.

1544
01:24:29,289 --> 01:24:29,789
No way.

1545
01:24:32,699 --> 01:24:33,199
What?

1546
01:24:45,210 --> 01:24:45,710
Yeah, yeah.

1547
01:24:53,079 --> 01:24:53,800
Burnt on cheese.

1548
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,420
And they always make the pans look so dirty.

1549
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:12,619
Oh, that's fucking awesome.

1550
01:25:15,619 --> 01:25:16,119
Whoa.

1551
01:25:17,770 --> 01:25:18,649
Bagel sandwiches?

1552
01:25:21,529 --> 01:25:22,250
Bro, I'm sorry.

1553
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:22,970
I would want this.

1554
01:25:22,970 --> 01:25:23,470
I'd get it.

1555
01:25:27,239 --> 01:25:28,279
I don't care what anybody says.

1556
01:25:38,279 --> 01:25:39,560
The double decker.

1557
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:41,079
The blue cheese bomber.

1558
01:25:41,079 --> 01:25:42,359
The buffalo chicken burger.

1559
01:25:42,359 --> 01:25:44,840
Oh, couldn't come up with one for that one.

1560
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:45,880
Triple stack attack.

1561
01:25:46,359 --> 01:25:48,039
The Cajun bayou burger.

1562
01:25:48,039 --> 01:25:48,680
The pork burger.

1563
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:51,210
The turkey delight burger.

1564
01:25:51,210 --> 01:25:51,710
Just-

1565
01:25:55,479 --> 01:25:56,680
Kicken crab cakes.

1566
01:25:57,739 --> 01:25:59,340
Mushroom swiss slider.

1567
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:00,619
Curry burger.

1568
01:26:00,619 --> 01:26:01,500
Reuben slider.

1569
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:02,380
Bruchetta burger.

1570
01:26:07,689 --> 01:26:09,720
All right, I gotta be honest.

1571
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:13,989
The Billy burger looks fucking dope.

1572
01:26:13,989 --> 01:26:14,630
Dope.

1573
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:16,819
What is that?

1574
01:26:16,819 --> 01:26:18,020
Chopped grilled onions?

1575
01:26:18,020 --> 01:26:20,100
Ketchup mustard slice of American cheese on a patty?

1576
01:26:20,659 --> 01:26:21,770
Looks dope.

1577
01:26:21,770 --> 01:26:22,729
Don't say dope.

1578
01:26:22,729 --> 01:26:23,229
Okay.

1579
01:26:31,529 --> 01:26:32,029
All right.

1580
01:26:33,689 --> 01:26:34,329
Can that do butter?

1581
01:26:36,010 --> 01:26:37,619
Crab slicer.

1582
01:26:37,619 --> 01:26:39,380
Here's how you can call or log on.

1583
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:40,180
1999.

1584
01:26:40,180 --> 01:26:40,659
There it is.

1585
01:26:40,659 --> 01:26:41,380
All right, that's-

1586
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:41,859
I love it.

1587
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:43,340
I would get-

1588
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:45,100
Okay, there's two or three that I would get.

1589
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:50,619
How about shake and take my blend buddy?

1590
01:26:50,619 --> 01:26:51,420
That's a long name.

1591
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:56,439
Okay, blenders actually are a pain in the ass.

1592
01:26:56,439 --> 01:26:59,000
So I will give this one a little bit of time here.

1593
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,560
Hate fussing with the blunders of blenders.

1594
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:03,159
Especially when you're on the go.

1595
01:27:03,159 --> 01:27:06,039
Then searching for a portable cop and messy cleanups.

1596
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:08,039
Well, now there's blend buddy.

1597
01:27:08,039 --> 01:27:12,039
The world's only blender that mixes right inside a portable sports bottle.

1598
01:27:12,039 --> 01:27:14,520
So you'll always have a quick new blend buddy.

1599
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:15,020
Wait.

1600
01:27:16,359 --> 01:27:16,859
Hold on.

1601
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:22,680
Where's her other hand?

1602
01:27:25,029 --> 01:27:26,390
Where's your other hand?

1603
01:27:26,390 --> 01:27:27,590
It's not holding anything.

1604
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:31,770
She's got a purse around the shoulder.

1605
01:27:31,770 --> 01:27:32,970
Her other hand is free.

1606
01:27:35,210 --> 01:27:36,329
Why don't you use the other hand?

1607
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:39,109
Well, now there's blend buddy.

1608
01:27:39,109 --> 01:27:43,109
The world's only blender that mixes right inside a portable sports bottle.

1609
01:27:43,109 --> 01:27:46,550
So you'll always have a quick meal ready fast and easy.

1610
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:48,390
Just fill with your favorite fruits.

1611
01:27:48,390 --> 01:27:49,109
Press the button.

1612
01:27:49,109 --> 01:27:49,590
Phone.

1613
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:50,869
Oh, up like this.

1614
01:27:50,869 --> 01:27:53,750
Your delicious blueberry smoothie is ready to go.

1615
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:54,310
Then simply-

1616
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:55,430
Oh, then it's a container.

1617
01:27:57,350 --> 01:27:58,710
Yeah, but the magic bullet did this.

1618
01:27:59,989 --> 01:28:01,510
The magic bullet did this already.

1619
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:03,350
Even the mixing blades are attached.

1620
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:04,789
So there's no extra parts.

1621
01:28:04,789 --> 01:28:08,390
The large 16-ounce container will satisfy the biggest thirst.

1622
01:28:08,390 --> 01:28:09,189
Man-sized.

1623
01:28:10,069 --> 01:28:12,069
And not only is it man-sized, but look at this.

1624
01:28:12,069 --> 01:28:14,090
This man's out working.

1625
01:28:14,090 --> 01:28:14,810
Construction.

1626
01:28:16,199 --> 01:28:17,560
Large for a man.

1627
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:20,010
Satisfy the biggest thirst.

1628
01:28:20,010 --> 01:28:24,010
And because it's dishwasher safe, blending a drink won't fill your sink.

1629
01:28:24,010 --> 01:28:25,050
But the best part-

1630
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:26,489
A man-sized thirst.

1631
01:28:26,489 --> 01:28:32,090
20,000 RPMs of power pulverizes frozen fruits, ice, and nuts into smooth, creamy drinks.

1632
01:28:32,090 --> 01:28:33,210
Guaranteed.

1633
01:28:33,210 --> 01:28:36,810
Not that you would, but even solid rock is turned into a fine powder.

1634
01:28:36,810 --> 01:28:37,609
That's broken now.

1635
01:28:37,609 --> 01:28:40,329
GlenBuddy is perfect for executives with busy schedules.

1636
01:28:40,329 --> 01:28:40,890
Executive.

1637
01:28:40,890 --> 01:28:41,850
A must for moths.

1638
01:28:41,850 --> 01:28:45,609
GlenBuddy is perfect for executives, but even solid rock is turned into a fine powder.

1639
01:28:45,609 --> 01:28:46,649
Is that a wedding ring?

1640
01:28:47,770 --> 01:28:48,890
That's a huge ring.

1641
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:49,689
Is that a wedding ring?

1642
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:59,859
That's a big wedding ring?

1643
01:28:59,859 --> 01:29:04,739
Is it executive?

1644
01:29:04,739 --> 01:29:05,699
No, it's not, right?

1645
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:09,060
What size does a wedding ring have to be on?

1646
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:16,630
That's a man-sized wedding ring.

1647
01:29:16,630 --> 01:29:19,510
Is perfect for executives with-

1648
01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:20,310
Executives.

1649
01:29:20,869 --> 01:29:22,810
I love its executives.

1650
01:29:22,810 --> 01:29:23,609
Oh, it's perfect.

1651
01:29:23,609 --> 01:29:25,609
It's perfect for an executive with a briefcase.

1652
01:29:29,829 --> 01:29:30,630
This executive?

1653
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:36,140
Where is this executive, by the way?

1654
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:38,060
Does he live here?

1655
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:39,180
Is this another person's house?

1656
01:29:42,739 --> 01:29:43,859
Who is the exec-

1657
01:29:43,859 --> 01:29:45,060
Perfect for the executive.

1658
01:29:47,210 --> 01:29:51,539
Because they've shown us the same people the whole time, right?

1659
01:29:51,539 --> 01:29:53,140
Is this the same family?

1660
01:29:56,739 --> 01:29:57,539
It's the same kitchen.

1661
01:29:58,359 --> 01:30:00,199
Oh no, it's not the same kitchen, okay.

1662
01:30:00,279 --> 01:30:01,479
I thought it was the same kitchen.

1663
01:30:03,270 --> 01:30:04,229
I thought it was the same kitchen.

1664
01:30:05,189 --> 01:30:07,350
Because I was going to say, are they all living in the same house?

1665
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:12,949
Because they showed, like, construction worker guy.

1666
01:30:12,949 --> 01:30:13,590
Executive.

1667
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:15,909
Mom, I'm guessing, right?

1668
01:30:15,909 --> 01:30:18,550
Like, I thought they were all going to be in the same house.

1669
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:25,189
The Sims.

1670
01:30:31,350 --> 01:30:36,470
Oh, executive-sized thirst.

1671
01:30:42,949 --> 01:30:43,510
These are kind of-

1672
01:30:51,829 --> 01:30:52,710
That wouldn't be a bad gift.

1673
01:30:56,789 --> 01:30:58,069
That's not a bad gift, I don't think.

1674
01:30:58,069 --> 01:31:00,789
Like, that's a cool prio-centrist-

1675
01:31:00,789 --> 01:31:01,590
Whatever.

1676
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:04,069
All right, how about the potato express?

1677
01:31:12,390 --> 01:31:12,890
What?

1678
01:31:14,789 --> 01:31:15,909
Holy shit!

1679
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:21,770
I didn't even think this was a potato.

1680
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:24,170
Oh my god, what happened to this?

1681
01:31:26,329 --> 01:31:30,420
This looks like a-

1682
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:32,500
That's like, that's plastic or something.

1683
01:31:34,010 --> 01:31:35,850
A potato doesn't do that in the microwave.

1684
01:31:37,930 --> 01:31:38,970
45 minutes?

1685
01:31:40,729 --> 01:31:49,399
Did they fuck this up, and does this person not understand that it's 45 minutes in the oven,

1686
01:31:49,399 --> 01:31:52,119
and not 45 minutes in the microwave?

1687
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:04,300
Whoa.

1688
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:11,579
All right, what is that?

1689
01:32:17,899 --> 01:32:18,699
What the fuck?

1690
01:32:20,779 --> 01:32:22,779
The insulation steam pocket technology.

1691
01:32:23,420 --> 01:32:26,060
All right, this is high-tech.

1692
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:30,060
Why are they putting it in an oven mitt?

1693
01:32:30,060 --> 01:32:32,060
It's not an oven mitt.

1694
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:34,060
It's not an oven mitt.

1695
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:36,060
It's not an oven mitt.

1696
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:36,859
It's something, it don't-

1697
01:32:36,859 --> 01:32:38,859
I'm telling you, there's something in there that makes it microwave safe.

1698
01:32:52,779 --> 01:32:54,779
Delicious potato salad ever.

1699
01:32:54,779 --> 01:32:59,020
Use potato express for super quick home fries for a gourmet breakfast.

1700
01:32:59,020 --> 01:33:02,220
Potato express will save you time when making mashed potatoes-

1701
01:33:02,220 --> 01:33:03,260
Sugar and mar- I don't know.

1702
01:33:03,260 --> 01:33:04,779
Or present tender potato skins.

1703
01:33:04,779 --> 01:33:08,220
Machine washable and reusable over and over again.

1704
01:33:08,220 --> 01:33:10,539
Stop wasting time baking potatoes in the-

1705
01:33:10,539 --> 01:33:12,779
Stop opening the oven when you're cooking food.

1706
01:33:12,779 --> 01:33:13,899
Maybe that would help that-

1707
01:33:13,899 --> 01:33:16,380
You know why it takes you 45 minutes to cook a potato?

1708
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:19,340
Because you go like this every fucking two minutes.

1709
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:19,979
Leave it alone.

Stop wasting time-

1713
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:27,739
Did you just put three baked potatoes on the rack?

1714
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:31,260
Stop opening the oven.

1715
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:31,899
In the oven.

Absolutely free.

Instantly garnish your potatoes with cheese and more.

1724
01:33:43,340 --> 01:33:44,140
I own one of these.

1725
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:45,260
It's actually pretty good.

1726
01:33:45,260 --> 01:33:46,380
Double your order free.

1727
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:46,859
Just pay separate processing and handling.

1728
01:33:46,859 --> 01:33:48,539
Doesn't surprise me.

1729
01:33:48,539 --> 01:33:49,500
You get it all.

1730
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:51,180
Two potato express, two-

1731
01:33:51,180 --> 01:33:51,899
Was that seasoning?

1732
01:33:51,899 --> 01:33:53,260
And two perfect graters.

1733
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:54,619
All for just $10.

1734
01:33:55,420 --> 01:33:56,859
So wait, you actually have this?

1735
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:58,060
Does it work?

1736
01:34:00,109 --> 01:34:00,909
If it works, it works.

1737
01:34:00,909 --> 01:34:01,630
That's why I-

1738
01:34:01,630 --> 01:34:02,189
I don't want to-

1739
01:34:02,189 --> 01:34:04,909
Look, talking shit about these like commercials, sure, right?

1740
01:34:04,909 --> 01:34:05,869
We can do that.

1741
01:34:05,869 --> 01:34:09,560
But if they work as advertised and they're useful-

1742
01:34:12,439 --> 01:34:13,000
Good.

1743
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:13,800
All right.

1744
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:14,520
It works.

1745
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:15,479
My friend has one of these.

1746
01:34:15,479 --> 01:34:16,039
It works.

1747
01:34:16,039 --> 01:34:16,600
And then it works.

1748
01:34:17,239 --> 01:34:18,039
Who cares?

1749
01:34:18,039 --> 01:34:18,680
There's no problem.

1750
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:22,220
I am so ready for the Hulk grill

1751
01:34:22,220 --> 01:34:24,619
because it's going to be a ton of man-sized portions.

1752
01:34:24,619 --> 01:34:26,300
You've tried other grills on the market.

1753
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:27,659
Some of them may drain the grease,

1754
01:34:27,659 --> 01:34:28,859
but don't cook the meat even-

1755
01:34:28,859 --> 01:34:29,100
Is that-

1756
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:30,140
Is that Hulk Hogan?

1757
01:34:30,939 --> 01:34:34,060
Now you can enjoy juicy cooked burgers grilled to perfection.

1758
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:36,380
Grilled cheese sandwiches in just 30 seconds.

1759
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:39,340
Homemade golden brown Belgian waffles in just minutes.

1760
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:39,899
Why was it-

1761
01:34:39,899 --> 01:34:40,539
Delicious panini sandwiches in five minutes.

1762
01:34:40,539 --> 01:34:41,819
Why did they use Hulk Hogan?

1763
01:34:41,819 --> 01:34:44,380
Fresh or frozen pizza baked in 15 minutes.

1764
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:46,699
Amazing quesadillas in only two minutes.

1765
01:34:46,699 --> 01:34:48,380
Plump and juicy hot dogs.

1766
01:34:48,380 --> 01:34:50,220
Amazing thick cut frozen steaks-

1767
01:34:50,220 --> 01:34:51,500
Is Hulk Hogan in the commercial?

1768
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:53,579
...perfection in only 20 minutes.

1769
01:34:53,579 --> 01:34:55,020
Even delicious desserts.

1770
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:55,579
And your kids-

1771
01:34:55,579 --> 01:34:56,380
Hulk size.

1772
01:34:56,380 --> 01:34:57,020
...will look like this.

1773
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:58,779
Oh my god.

1774
01:34:58,779 --> 01:35:00,060
...lives up to its name.

1775
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:01,100
The Hulk Hogan?

1776
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:02,460
Hulk Hogan's ultimate grill.

1777
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:03,659
This is George Foreman.

1778
01:35:03,659 --> 01:35:05,899
Because its extra large interchangeable plates

1779
01:35:05,899 --> 01:35:08,460
easily transforms your Hulk Hogan grill into a skillet.

1780
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:09,739
This is George Foreman grill.

1781
01:35:09,739 --> 01:35:10,779
The Hulk Hogan grill?

1782
01:35:10,779 --> 01:35:12,140
Pizza oven.

1783
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:12,460
What?

1784
01:35:12,460 --> 01:35:13,579
Quesadilla maker.

1785
01:35:13,579 --> 01:35:14,859
A buffet warmer.

1786
01:35:14,859 --> 01:35:15,819
And then some.

1787
01:35:15,819 --> 01:35:18,619
That's $1,200 worth of specialty appliances

1788
01:35:18,619 --> 01:35:21,100
in just one countertop rebel-

1789
01:35:21,180 --> 01:35:23,659
I thought he was going to say twelve hundred appliances.

1790
01:35:25,869 --> 01:35:26,430
Okay, what is it?

1791
01:35:26,430 --> 01:35:26,829
What is it?

1792
01:35:26,829 --> 01:35:27,789
This is a fry-

1793
01:35:27,789 --> 01:35:30,239
No, this is like a serving tray.

1794
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:32,079
Twelve hundred appliances.

1795
01:35:32,079 --> 01:35:33,359
...a buffet warmer.

1796
01:35:33,359 --> 01:35:34,319
And then some.

1797
01:35:34,319 --> 01:35:37,119
That's $1,200 worth of specialty appliances

1798
01:35:37,119 --> 01:35:38,479
in just one countertop rebel-

1799
01:35:38,479 --> 01:35:39,520
And it's Hulk size.

1800
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:40,479
Not even man size.

1801
01:35:40,479 --> 01:35:43,520
Best of all, the food is filled with ultimate flavor.

1802
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:46,560
The secret is the ultimate grill cooks with mechanical pressure.

1803
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:49,039
Just lock the lid, instantly searing in flavor-

1804
01:35:49,039 --> 01:35:49,840
Why is he here?

1805
01:35:51,199 --> 01:35:52,000
Why is he here?

1806
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,199
...sides every time.

1807
01:35:53,199 --> 01:35:53,840
Plus with its-

1808
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:55,920
We better get like a 30-second monologue

1809
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:57,279
of him looking right in the camera.

1810
01:35:57,279 --> 01:35:58,319
Let me tell you something, brother.

1811
01:35:59,039 --> 01:36:00,319
The Hulk Hogan grill.

1812
01:36:00,319 --> 01:36:01,279
It's got the healthiest-

1813
01:36:01,279 --> 01:36:02,399
Yeah, please do it.

1814
01:36:02,399 --> 01:36:04,159
...way to the self-contained fat trapper.

1815
01:36:04,159 --> 01:36:06,239
The unique floating hinge allows the ultimate grill

1816
01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:07,840
to adjust to the size of the food,

1817
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:10,159
so it's cooked to perfection every time.

1818
01:36:10,159 --> 01:36:11,680
Just the way you like it.

1819
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:14,720
Grill Hulk-size chops, steaks, chicken, and fish.

1820
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:15,199
Open it up-

1821
01:36:15,199 --> 01:36:17,199
You don't have Hulk Hogan on the thing

1822
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:19,199
if he doesn't say something monologue for ten seconds.

1823
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:21,760
...ultimate grill turns into the ultimate panini sandwich

1824
01:36:22,079 --> 01:36:23,600
to make grilled turkey paninis.

1825
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:25,039
Make a quick and healthy lunch for you-

1826
01:36:25,039 --> 01:36:26,640
I thought that was Hulk Hogan for a second.

1827
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:29,199
...heat settings allow you to cook different foods at the same time.

1828
01:36:29,199 --> 01:36:32,239
Cook bacon, sausages, or other breakfast meats on the grill plate

1829
01:36:32,239 --> 01:36:35,199
while the excess grease drains into the self-contained fat trapper.

1830
01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:38,239
Seafood is perfect to cook on Hulk Hogan's ultimate grill.

1831
01:36:38,239 --> 01:36:40,239
You can easily cook swordfish on one side,

1832
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:42,000
scallops and shrimp kebabs on the other.

1833
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,560
Close the grill and cook delicious savory salmon.

1834
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:47,199
Grill large chicken breasts while keeping them plump and juicy-

1835
01:36:47,199 --> 01:36:50,640
They showed him eating half a hot dog in one bite and that's it.

1836
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:51,600
...serve with grilled vegetables.

1837
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,840
Take the leftover chicken, add a tortilla,

1838
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:56,319
and you've got amazing fresh quesadillas.

1839
01:36:56,319 --> 01:36:57,600
Hulk Hogan's ultimate grill-

1840
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,399
Where is he?

1841
01:36:58,399 --> 01:37:01,840
...you're on a special diet, whether it's high protein or vegetarian.

1842
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:04,079
Stir-fry all your vegetables on one side.

1843
01:37:04,079 --> 01:37:06,079
At the same time, you can heat up your rice.

1844
01:37:06,079 --> 01:37:08,399
Place a large, fresh, or frozen pizza on the skillet,

1845
01:37:08,399 --> 01:37:12,800
and in just 15 minutes, you've got a mouth-watering, gourmet, crispy pizza.

1846
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:14,880
Best of all, cleanup is a breeze.

1847
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:17,199
Just put the self-contained no-spill fat trapper

1848
01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:18,800
in cooking plates in the dishwasher.

1849
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:20,000
It's that easy.

1850
01:37:20,079 --> 01:37:21,680
Hulk Hogan's ultimate grill-

1851
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:22,880
He's not here!

1852
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:26,159
...apartments, dorm rooms, RVs, boats, and so much more.

1853
01:37:29,689 --> 01:37:30,170
That's it?

1854
01:37:30,890 --> 01:37:31,449
That's it?

1855
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:33,640
No way!

1856
01:37:34,439 --> 01:37:35,720
What the fuck?

1857
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:40,439
He's just a gif in the corner and they showed him biting into a hot dog.

1858
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:43,880
He didn't do anything.

1859
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:46,199
He didn't do anything but this.

1860
01:37:46,199 --> 01:37:48,680
...the food is filled with ultimate flavor.

1861
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:49,800
The secret is the ultimate-

1862
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:52,359
He just bit into a hot dog.

1863
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:55,319
Maybe there's a 30-minute version?

1864
01:37:56,199 --> 01:37:58,680
I hope there is, because holy shit, that's so funny.

1865
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:01,800
But even if this is the short version,

1866
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:06,600
you're not going to have Hulk Hogan doing anything besides bite a hot dog

1867
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:09,529
in your two- three-minute spot?

1868
01:38:09,529 --> 01:38:13,119
Your three-minute spot has him biting a hot dog.

1869
01:38:13,119 --> 01:38:14,560
You've got to have him being like,

1870
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:16,479
oh, this is- I'm telling you something, this is really good.

1871
01:38:16,479 --> 01:38:18,000
It's very flavorful, very healthy.

1872
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:18,960
You've got to get him to talk.

1873
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,479
That's it?

1874
01:38:20,479 --> 01:38:23,479
There's definitely got to be a 30-minute version.

1875
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:27,930
When you make merch for-

1876
01:38:27,930 --> 01:38:28,989
Listen to me.

1877
01:38:28,989 --> 01:38:33,680
When you make merch for your commercial,

1878
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:36,510
it's going to be a 30-minute spot.

1879
01:38:36,510 --> 01:38:36,989
No way.

1880
01:38:36,989 --> 01:38:38,029
This is the three minutes.

1881
01:38:39,229 --> 01:38:43,359
All right.

1882
01:38:43,359 --> 01:38:46,000
How about the Fresh Mex Express?

1883
01:38:47,449 --> 01:38:49,609
You love a delicious Mexican fiesta?

1884
01:38:49,609 --> 01:38:50,489
Yes, I do.

1885
01:38:50,489 --> 01:38:51,529
Salsa, guacamole-

1886
01:38:51,529 --> 01:38:52,329
Bring it on.

1887
01:38:52,329 --> 01:38:55,529
...but chopping, slicing, mixing, it's a chore.

1888
01:38:55,529 --> 01:38:57,850
Hi, David Jones here with Fresh Mex Express.

1889
01:38:57,850 --> 01:38:58,329
David Jones.

1890
01:38:58,329 --> 01:39:02,970
...the fast, easy way to make guacamole, salsa, and more in seconds.

1891
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:03,449
Watch.

1892
01:39:03,449 --> 01:39:06,010
Just add tomatoes, onions, and cilantro.

1893
01:39:06,010 --> 01:39:06,970
Put the lid on.

1894
01:39:06,970 --> 01:39:08,170
Give it a couple of turns.

1895
01:39:08,170 --> 01:39:11,609
In less than five seconds, you have unbelievable fresh salsa.

1896
01:39:11,609 --> 01:39:12,970
I don't know, but I don't know.

1897
01:39:12,970 --> 01:39:14,489
I don't know if this is a new character.

1898
01:39:15,739 --> 01:39:16,539
David Jones?

1899
01:39:17,630 --> 01:39:18,029
I don't know.

1900
01:39:18,029 --> 01:39:19,069
I don't like new characters.

1901
01:39:19,069 --> 01:39:19,869
I don't like new things.

1902
01:39:24,409 --> 01:39:26,810
Maybe we'll warm up to him.

1903
01:39:26,810 --> 01:39:27,289
Easy.

1904
01:39:27,289 --> 01:39:29,930
Take some avocados, onions, cilantro,

1905
01:39:29,930 --> 01:39:33,369
for a full bowl of guacamole in just five seconds.

1906
01:39:33,369 --> 01:39:34,569
That was way more than five seconds.

1907
01:39:34,569 --> 01:39:39,689
...the three ultra-sharp stainless steel blades that chop, mix, and prep in just one step.

1908
01:39:39,689 --> 01:39:44,250
Thick, medium, or finely chopped with Fresh Mex Express, the choice is yours.

1909
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:44,649
This is fucking stupid.

1910
01:39:44,649 --> 01:39:50,090
Make a spicy guacamole, mouth-watering mango salsa, creamy chili cheese dip,

1911
01:39:50,090 --> 01:39:54,409
flavorful black bean dip, even make fresh, healthy hummus, and-

1912
01:39:54,409 --> 01:39:55,529
What the fuck?

1913
01:39:55,529 --> 01:39:56,649
...nothing's better.

1914
01:39:56,649 --> 01:39:57,770
Top burritos with guacamole-

1915
01:39:57,770 --> 01:39:58,649
I can't, man.

1916
01:39:58,649 --> 01:40:00,170
This is fucking so dumb.

1917
01:40:00,170 --> 01:40:03,050
...make cheesy steak fajitas, load up nachos,

1918
01:40:03,850 --> 01:40:07,449
that bulky food processor is a pain and takes forever to clean,

1919
01:40:07,449 --> 01:40:11,850
but Fresh Mex Express chops, mixes, and serves in the same bowl,

1920
01:40:11,850 --> 01:40:13,609
and it's dishwasher safe.

1921
01:40:13,609 --> 01:40:18,010
Now get Fresh Mex Express complete with our South of the Border Recipe Guide for just-

1922
01:40:18,010 --> 01:40:19,369
We found the whole cut.

1923
01:40:20,729 --> 01:40:21,130
Good.

1924
01:40:21,130 --> 01:40:21,930
I'm happy about it.

1925
01:40:21,930 --> 01:40:24,090
...stackable storage lid to save tasty leftovers,

1926
01:40:24,090 --> 01:40:27,050
but call right now and we'll double the offer free-

1927
01:40:27,050 --> 01:40:28,409
They keep playing the same-

1928
01:40:28,409 --> 01:40:30,010
Oh, it's killing me.

1929
01:40:30,010 --> 01:40:36,279
They keep playing the same 10-minute clip.

1930
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,439
The same 10-minute music file.

1931
01:40:39,439 --> 01:40:40,960
It's like, oh, come on, man.

1932
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:43,359
You don't got anything else to put here?

1933
01:40:43,359 --> 01:40:45,359
...stackable storage lid to save tasty leftovers-

1934
01:40:45,359 --> 01:40:46,720
It's so fucking dumb.

1935
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:48,960
...call right now and we'll double the offer free.

1936
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,720
Just pay separate processing and handling.

1937
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:55,119
And to really spice things up, you'll also get our Tortilla Express free.

1938
01:40:55,119 --> 01:41:00,560
Microwave moist steamed tortillas in just seconds that stay hot for up to an hour.

1939
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:01,680
You get it all.

1940
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:04,560
Two Fresh Mex Expresses with storage lids-

1941
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:05,199
Who's that?

1942
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:08,960
...and the Tortilla Express for just $19.99.

1943
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:09,199
All right.

1944
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:10,720
What if it might be fun?

1945
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:12,159
If it's doable to work with the kids.

1946
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:14,079
We found the Hulk one.

1947
01:41:14,079 --> 01:41:14,880
All right, hold on.

1948
01:41:20,220 --> 01:41:20,859
All right.

1949
01:41:20,859 --> 01:41:23,260
Let me- I gotta go pee.

1950
01:41:23,260 --> 01:41:24,460
I'll be right back.

1951
01:41:31,850 --> 01:41:33,529
Try modulating video speed.

1952
01:41:38,939 --> 01:41:39,340
I'll be back.

1953
01:41:39,340 --> 01:41:40,220
I gotta pee.

1954
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:41,840
We'll be back with more.

1955
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:43,039
I'll put the Hulk one on.

1956
01:41:43,039 --> 01:47:59,310
Oh, shit.

1957
01:47:59,310 --> 01:48:01,229
I forgot the- Oh, well.

1958
01:48:01,229 --> 01:48:01,550
Oops.

1959
01:48:02,270 --> 01:48:04,220
All right.

1960
01:48:04,220 --> 01:48:08,680
Where's the link to the-

1961
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:13,960
Okay, we got it in the mods gave to me.

1962
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:14,760
Is this the whole thing?

1963
01:48:24,329 --> 01:48:24,729
Yep.

1964
01:48:24,729 --> 01:48:25,689
28 minutes.

1965
01:48:25,689 --> 01:48:29,130
Oh, hell yeah.

1966
01:48:29,130 --> 01:48:31,689
The following is a paid for the Hulk Hogan Ultimate Grill.

1967
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:37,739
Oh, fuck yeah.

1968
01:48:37,739 --> 01:48:38,060
Okay.

1969
01:48:39,100 --> 01:48:40,220
Let me just pull this.

1970
01:48:42,109 --> 01:48:48,119
So this is the Hulk Hogan Ultimate Grill.

1971
01:48:48,119 --> 01:48:50,520
It's probably going to be in like 140p.

1972
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:51,720
Just to let everybody know.

1973
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:55,319
Come back over here.

1974
01:48:58,029 --> 01:48:58,829
We're not going to watch the whole thing.

1975
01:49:01,039 --> 01:49:01,680
Maybe we will.

1976
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:02,640
Let's find out.

1977
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:06,329
You guys ready?

1978
01:49:06,329 --> 01:49:07,289
The following is-

1979
01:49:07,289 --> 01:49:11,689
That was very loud.

1980
01:49:11,689 --> 01:49:14,090
Paid advertisement for Hulk Hogan's Ultimate Grill.

1981
01:49:14,090 --> 01:49:16,090
Brought to you by TriStar Products Incorporated.

1982
01:49:16,090 --> 01:49:16,329
All right.

1983
01:49:16,329 --> 01:49:16,890
Let's go.

1984
01:49:16,890 --> 01:49:17,609
Hey, guys.

1985
01:49:17,609 --> 01:49:18,810
I'm Hulk Hogan.

1986
01:49:18,810 --> 01:49:20,649
Stay with me for the next half hour.

1987
01:49:20,649 --> 01:49:22,329
I'm going to show you my latest invention.

1988
01:49:23,449 --> 01:49:24,329
My invention.

1989
01:49:27,130 --> 01:49:29,689
Finally, a grill that lives up to its name.

1990
01:49:29,689 --> 01:49:31,449
Hulk Hogan's Ultimate Grill.

1991
01:49:31,449 --> 01:49:32,569
It's the ultimate because-

1992
01:49:32,569 --> 01:49:32,890
Okay.

1993
01:49:32,890 --> 01:49:35,850
The large interchangeable plates easily transforms your-

1994
01:49:35,850 --> 01:49:36,090
You know what?

1995
01:49:36,090 --> 01:49:37,930
They definitely were just like,

1996
01:49:37,930 --> 01:49:40,640
Hey, Hulk, Hulk Hogan.

1997
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:45,359
We're going to run the camera for three minutes.

1998
01:49:45,359 --> 01:49:46,239
And just do whatever you want.

1999
01:49:46,239 --> 01:49:48,399
Do like three or four promos.

2000
01:49:48,399 --> 01:49:49,850
And you can literally say anything you want.

2001
01:49:49,850 --> 01:49:50,810
Just kind of flex and shit.

2002
01:49:50,810 --> 01:49:53,069
And we're just going to put you around the commercial.

2003
01:49:53,069 --> 01:49:55,840
And then I think he's in person here.

2004
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:56,560
This is important.

2005
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:57,439
To a skillet.

2006
01:49:57,439 --> 01:49:58,399
Panini sandwich press.

2007
01:49:58,399 --> 01:49:59,039
He made this.

2008
01:49:59,039 --> 01:49:59,840
Pizza oven.

2009
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:00,479
And then some-

2010
01:50:00,479 --> 01:50:01,359
No, he did not.

2011
01:50:01,359 --> 01:50:02,319
Ultimate Grill cooks with mechanical pressure-

2012
01:50:02,319 --> 01:50:04,319
George Foreman did 10 years before this.

2013
01:50:04,319 --> 01:50:04,399
Just like the lid.

2014
01:50:04,399 --> 01:50:06,319
Instantly searing in flavor and juices.

2015
01:50:06,319 --> 01:50:09,920
You have evenly perfectly grilled food on both sides every time.

2016
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:12,159
Plus with its two huge cooking surfaces,

2017
01:50:12,159 --> 01:50:15,680
along with the dual variable heat settings from 210 to 425 degrees,

2018
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:17,439
you can easily cook healthy meals.

2019
01:50:17,439 --> 01:50:21,119
While excess fat drips away into the self-contained fat trapper.

2020
01:50:21,119 --> 01:50:23,920
Just remove it, empty it, and put it in the dishwasher.

2021
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:27,520
The unique floating hinge allows the Ultimate Grill to adjust to the size of the food.

2022
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:28,479
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2023
01:50:28,479 --> 01:50:28,960
Excuse me.

2024
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:30,960
I- Men don't like healthy things.

2025
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:34,720
We like chicken, cheese, bacon, and cheeseburgers.

2026
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:36,960
Grilled cheese sandwiches in just 30 seconds.

2027
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:40,000
Homemade golden brown Belgian waffles in just minutes.

2028
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,479
Delicious panini sandwiches in five minutes.

2029
01:50:42,479 --> 01:50:45,039
Pressure frozen pizza baked in 15 minutes.

2030
01:50:45,039 --> 01:50:47,359
Amazing quesadillas in only two minutes.

2031
01:50:47,359 --> 01:50:48,319
And coffee.

2032
01:50:48,319 --> 01:50:49,039
Juicy hot dogs.

2033
01:50:49,039 --> 01:50:54,479
Amazing thick cut frozen steaks cooked to mouthwatering perfection in only 20 minutes.

2034
01:50:54,479 --> 01:50:55,039
20 minutes?

2035
01:50:55,039 --> 01:50:55,600
Even delicious desserts.

2036
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:58,079
And your kitchen doesn't have to look like this.

2037
01:50:58,079 --> 01:50:58,560
Stay tuned to discover how you can replace over time.

2038
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:02,000
You stood from the back of the room and threw those puffs into the sink.

2039
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:05,119
With just one countertop wonder that's simple to use,

2040
01:51:05,119 --> 01:51:08,479
simple to clean, and is as easy to store as a box of cereal.

2041
01:51:08,479 --> 01:51:13,359
Here's our host, Bob Wharton, and the man who demanded the Ultimate Grilling Machine.

2042
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:18,880
To discover how you can replace over $1,200 of appliances with just one countertop wonder

2043
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:23,359
that's simple to use, simple to clean, and is as easy to store as a box of cereal.

2044
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:27,840
Who's putting a box of cereal down here?

2045
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:30,960
And is as easy to store as a box of cereal.

2046
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:32,960
Why are you hiding this in like a safe down here?

2047
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:34,800
A box of cereal?

2048
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:37,279
Here's our host, Bob Wharton, and the man who demanded the Ultimate Grilling Machine.

2049
01:51:37,279 --> 01:51:39,520
Oh, the man who demanded the Ultimate Grill.

2050
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:45,260
Finally, we've come up with a grill that lives up to its name.

2051
01:51:45,260 --> 01:51:49,579
It's the Ultimate Grill, and it's definitely the Ultimate Cooking Appliance.

2052
01:51:49,579 --> 01:51:52,460
And we promised everyone that they'd love my grill so much.

2053
01:51:52,460 --> 01:51:54,619
Don't you dare talk over Hulk Hogan, right?

2054
01:51:55,420 --> 01:51:59,579
Like, he's like, don't you dare.

2055
01:51:59,579 --> 01:52:03,500
Okay. Well, this is one of the most popular grills on the market.

2056
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:06,779
It cooks on a slant, and it may drain all the grease.

2057
01:52:06,779 --> 01:52:08,539
But what are some of the other problems it may have?

2058
01:52:08,539 --> 01:52:10,220
This grease is horrible here on the tray.

2059
01:52:10,220 --> 01:52:11,260
Oh, what the fuck?

2060
01:52:11,260 --> 01:52:13,020
Because this has no temperature control.

2061
01:52:14,140 --> 01:52:15,579
Wait, they're making it look like shit.

2062
01:52:15,579 --> 01:52:19,420
The hamburgers are well done at the back while they're still rare in the front.

2063
01:52:19,420 --> 01:52:21,260
And it's a real problem to clean up.

2064
01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:22,859
Now, watch this.

2065
01:52:23,659 --> 01:52:25,579
Oh, that's supposed to be the George Mormon.

2066
01:52:25,579 --> 01:52:27,579
But we're going to put six burgers on there.

2067
01:52:27,579 --> 01:52:28,859
Hey, guys, notice this.

2068
01:52:28,859 --> 01:52:30,380
These aren't ordinary burgers.

2069
01:52:30,380 --> 01:52:32,220
These are Hulk-sized burgers.

2070
01:52:32,220 --> 01:52:37,500
And we are going to show you how we get them to cook evenly from the front all the way to the back.

2071
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:39,180
Here's where the difference is.

2072
01:52:39,180 --> 01:52:44,220
On the back of this, we have it raised up so that the hinge will automatically pop up.

2073
01:52:44,220 --> 01:52:47,020
And then on the front, we push down and we...

2074
01:52:47,020 --> 01:52:48,779
You know why I don't like these grills?

2075
01:52:49,659 --> 01:52:50,699
Because I can't see it.

2076
01:52:52,300 --> 01:52:53,819
I can't see what the food...

2077
01:52:54,859 --> 01:52:56,140
I need to kind of look at it, right?

2078
01:52:59,020 --> 01:53:00,060
I feel like I want to see it.

2079
01:53:06,140 --> 01:53:07,020
Oh, there's nothing on it.

2080
01:53:07,979 --> 01:53:08,479
Oh!

2081
01:53:11,020 --> 01:53:12,779
It's just meat and bun.

2082
01:53:12,779 --> 01:53:14,060
Oh, what the fuck?

2083
01:53:14,060 --> 01:53:15,819
Look at how small that looks in his hands.

2084
01:53:19,659 --> 01:53:20,779
This is tiny.

2085
01:53:20,779 --> 01:53:21,659
This looks like a toy.

2086
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:33,119
Like, he actually has to, like, lean down and go, like...

2087
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:34,479
This is very small.

2088
01:53:35,680 --> 01:53:39,479
I wouldn't consider this to be Hulk-sized.

2089
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:41,479
No, he just took out a third of the burger in one bite.

2090
01:53:42,119 --> 01:53:43,239
That's not Hulk-sized at all.

2091
01:53:44,039 --> 01:53:46,699
Grill.

2092
01:53:46,699 --> 01:53:47,500
Or ultimate grill.

2093
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:49,340
The horse can't live on burgers alone, brother.

2094
01:53:49,340 --> 01:53:52,060
What about this panini sandwich maker?

2095
01:53:52,060 --> 01:53:54,699
This is a professional panini maker we went out and bought.

2096
01:53:54,699 --> 01:53:56,859
Costs $430.

2097
01:53:56,859 --> 01:53:57,420
What?

2098
01:53:57,420 --> 01:53:58,460
And it does a great job.

2099
01:53:58,460 --> 01:53:59,180
And what we figured out...

2100
01:53:59,180 --> 01:53:59,659
What?

2101
01:53:59,659 --> 01:54:00,220
That's...

2102
01:54:00,220 --> 01:54:00,699
Seriously.

2103
01:54:00,699 --> 01:54:01,659
...does a good job is...

2104
01:54:01,659 --> 01:54:04,140
I think that was a genuine reaction because that's horse shit.

2105
01:54:04,140 --> 01:54:08,060
...and the weight to actually cook the sandwich from top to bottom.

2106
01:54:08,060 --> 01:54:08,779
You said weight.

2107
01:54:08,779 --> 01:54:10,300
This thing looks like it weighs up.

2108
01:54:11,659 --> 01:54:12,619
A ton.

2109
01:54:12,619 --> 01:54:13,340
Yeah, well, that's a lot.

2110
01:54:13,340 --> 01:54:14,539
Okay, who's gonna hold this thing around?

2111
01:54:14,539 --> 01:54:17,260
If even Hulk Hogan's having trouble with this, you know it must be very heavy.

2112
01:54:17,260 --> 01:54:18,779
Well, that's the only thing you really use that for.

2113
01:54:20,479 --> 01:54:23,520
Take a look at those paninis.

2114
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:24,319
Those are huge.

2115
01:54:24,319 --> 01:54:26,079
Now, do you see how that indent line is there?

2116
01:54:26,079 --> 01:54:31,439
That's the mechanical pressure and weight that we're able to put on with ultimate grill.

2117
01:54:31,439 --> 01:54:32,720
I want one of these shirts.

2118
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:33,199
Those look great.

2119
01:54:33,199 --> 01:54:35,520
I think those look better than those beautiful burgers.

2120
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:37,439
I want one of these shirts so bad.

2121
01:54:37,439 --> 01:54:38,159
Look at that cheese.

2122
01:54:38,159 --> 01:54:38,560
You know what I mean?

2123
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:39,520
Look at how beautifully that smells.

2124
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:41,680
Like the Hulk Hogan ultimate grill.

2125
01:54:41,680 --> 01:54:44,399
I feel like we'd be glad we got them inside.

2126
01:54:44,399 --> 01:54:45,199
I want one of those.

2127
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:48,239
Now, get rid of that.

2128
01:54:48,239 --> 01:54:49,359
Pizza is my favorite.

2129
01:54:49,359 --> 01:54:49,840
Really?

2130
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:51,920
Well, what we did is we went out and bought this pizza maker.

2131
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:53,840
It takes about 30 minutes.

2132
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:56,159
It's a little bit faster than heating up your whole oven,

2133
01:54:56,159 --> 01:54:59,119
but it takes 30 minutes to make a pizza.

2134
01:54:59,119 --> 01:54:59,760
Take a look.

2135
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:02,479
And we got this pizza maker from some shitty infomercial.

2136
01:55:02,479 --> 01:55:04,479
So take a look at our infomercial.

2137
01:55:04,479 --> 01:55:05,039
Ours is better.

2138
01:55:05,039 --> 01:55:08,399
I'm gonna slide this off and I'm gonna cut a piece because I want you to see.

2139
01:55:08,399 --> 01:55:09,199
That one's hot.

2140
01:55:09,199 --> 01:55:09,920
It is hot.

2141
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:11,600
Believe me, it is very hot.

2142
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:12,159
Hold on.

2143
01:55:12,159 --> 01:55:12,720
Wait, wait.

2144
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:14,159
I feel like I missed something here.

2145
01:55:14,159 --> 01:55:16,560
It takes 30 minutes to make a pizza.

2146
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:18,880
Take a look at that.

2147
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:20,319
Is that a pizza?

2148
01:55:20,319 --> 01:55:20,560
What?

2149
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:21,840
That is a pizza.

2150
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:25,760
Now, I'm gonna slide this off and I'm gonna cut a piece because I want you to see.

2151
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:26,720
That one's hot.

2152
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:27,359
It is hot.

2153
01:55:27,359 --> 01:55:30,319
Believe me, it is very, very hot.

2154
01:55:32,159 --> 01:55:34,000
Dude, what's with the pizza cutting?

2155
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,359
Holy shit, bro.

2156
01:55:35,359 --> 01:55:36,319
I cannot believe how good this is.

2157
01:55:36,319 --> 01:55:36,800
Come on.

2158
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:37,680
I did a smell.

2159
01:55:37,680 --> 01:55:38,079
What was that?

2160
01:55:38,079 --> 01:55:38,800
Oh, that was.

2161
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:40,539
Isn't that great?

2162
01:55:40,539 --> 01:55:41,340
Now, let me show you the bottom.

2163
01:55:41,340 --> 01:55:42,220
God, it looks good.

2164
01:55:42,220 --> 01:55:42,699
Look at this.

2165
01:55:43,579 --> 01:55:44,939
Oh, it's grilled perfectly.

2166
01:55:44,939 --> 01:55:45,500
What is he?

2167
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:46,859
Isn't it?

2168
01:55:46,859 --> 01:55:47,979
He's like scratching it.

2169
01:55:48,859 --> 01:55:49,739
He didn't even bite it.

2170
01:55:49,739 --> 01:55:50,939
Very, very hot.

2171
01:55:50,939 --> 01:55:51,899
He didn't even bite it.

2172
01:55:52,939 --> 01:55:55,180
Now, this is probably gonna be too hot to eat, Hulk.

2173
01:55:55,180 --> 01:55:56,140
This grill's amazing.

2174
01:55:56,140 --> 01:55:58,300
I cannot believe how good this pizza looks.

2175
01:55:58,300 --> 01:55:59,979
Just to get a smell and a feel of that.

2176
01:55:59,979 --> 01:56:00,619
A smell?

2177
01:56:00,619 --> 01:56:01,260
It's pizza.

2178
01:56:01,260 --> 01:56:01,579
Isn't that great?

2179
01:56:01,579 --> 01:56:02,380
Now, let me show you the bottom.

2180
01:56:02,380 --> 01:56:03,260
God, it looks good.

2181
01:56:03,260 --> 01:56:03,739
Look at this.

2182
01:56:04,619 --> 01:56:06,060
Oh, it's grilled perfectly.

2183
01:56:06,060 --> 01:56:06,939
It's perfect, isn't it?

2184
01:56:09,789 --> 01:56:11,869
I actually think the one on the pizza maker looks a little better.

2185
01:56:11,869 --> 01:56:13,310
In the morning breakfast, without a doubt,

2186
01:56:13,310 --> 01:56:15,390
this is the most important meal in my family.

2187
01:56:15,390 --> 01:56:16,670
I do the cooking in the morning.

2188
01:56:17,229 --> 01:56:19,869
So one of the problems I have is sometimes the eggs

2189
01:56:19,869 --> 01:56:22,670
aren't ready when the sausage is ready, the pancakes aren't done.

2190
01:56:22,670 --> 01:56:23,069
All right, yeah.

2191
01:56:23,069 --> 01:56:23,789
It's a real pain for me.

2192
01:56:23,789 --> 01:56:25,470
I have to figure out a way to make it all work at once.

2193
01:56:25,470 --> 01:56:28,750
OK, well, that's because even though this griddle costs over $100,

2194
01:56:28,750 --> 01:56:29,229
you really can't get every piece.

2195
01:56:29,229 --> 01:56:30,750
I mean, the problem is you didn't get Kathy Mitchell.

2196
01:56:30,750 --> 01:56:31,869
Look at all the grease.

2197
01:56:31,869 --> 01:56:32,350
The grease is in the pancakes.

2198
01:56:32,350 --> 01:56:33,390
Wait, did you just tell him to shut up?

2199
01:56:33,390 --> 01:56:34,029
That is ridiculous.

2200
01:56:34,029 --> 01:56:38,270
So if we could, well, that's because even though this griddle costs over $100,

2201
01:56:38,270 --> 01:56:40,109
you really can't cook everything at the same time.

2202
01:56:40,109 --> 01:56:40,510
Wait a minute, stop.

2203
01:56:40,510 --> 01:56:41,390
Look at all the grease.

2204
01:56:41,390 --> 01:56:43,069
The grease is in the pancakes.

2205
01:56:44,029 --> 01:56:45,229
That was an annoyed stop.

2206
01:56:45,229 --> 01:56:47,550
If we could separate the eggs in the pancakes from the bacon and sausage,

2207
01:56:47,550 --> 01:56:48,750
we'd have the solution, right?

2208
01:56:48,750 --> 01:56:49,250
You got it.

2209
01:56:50,189 --> 01:56:53,390
I put a griddle plate in here and a grill plate here.

2210
01:56:53,390 --> 01:56:56,430
I've already grilled the sausage at about 350 degrees.

2211
01:56:56,430 --> 01:57:00,909
I turned it down because I have the control to just warm about 200 degrees.

2212
01:57:00,909 --> 01:57:01,470
It's not following.

2213
01:57:01,470 --> 01:57:05,470
I cranked this up to 375 because now I'm ready to make pancakes

2214
01:57:05,470 --> 01:57:07,550
and now you can make your eggs to order.

2215
01:57:07,630 --> 01:57:09,069
Let's throw some eggs on there, buddy.

2216
01:57:09,069 --> 01:57:13,069
We can actually do a dozen eggs on here at a time if we want or about eight pancakes.

2217
01:57:13,710 --> 01:57:15,069
How about that for breakfast?

2218
01:57:15,069 --> 01:57:15,630
That's great.

2219
01:57:15,630 --> 01:57:16,430
That's unbelievable.

2220
01:57:18,359 --> 01:57:22,119
But okay, what's but a skill with this is it's good.

2221
01:57:22,119 --> 01:57:22,600
It's fine.

2222
01:57:23,479 --> 01:57:25,760
I think it's very interesting.

2223
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:26,399
God damn it.

2224
01:57:26,399 --> 01:57:28,880
You know, one thing that I wish whatever ever happened to me in my life,

2225
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:32,319
they used to do an infomercial of these.

2226
01:57:32,319 --> 01:57:33,520
Look at we're in a mall.

2227
01:57:34,239 --> 01:57:39,470
Come try it and come check it out and be on TV.

2228
01:57:39,470 --> 01:57:40,270
God damn it, man.

2229
01:57:40,270 --> 01:57:44,270
I wish I wish I if I if I ever see this ever,

2230
01:57:44,829 --> 01:57:47,390
I am running up to that fucking thing and being first in line.

2231
01:57:48,109 --> 01:57:49,149
I want to be that.

2232
01:57:49,149 --> 01:57:52,829
I want to be the weird guy that's just like it's so fresh.

2233
01:57:52,829 --> 01:57:54,270
It's delicious.

2234
01:57:54,270 --> 01:57:56,109
Better than better than grandma makes.

2235
01:57:56,109 --> 01:57:58,699
I want to do that so bad, even if it sucks.

2236
01:58:00,399 --> 01:58:02,960
I wish I could show you an infomercial where I was one of these people.

2237
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:09,439
You can do all this with the one one system because we have a waffle iron.

2238
01:58:09,439 --> 01:58:12,720
We have a little sandwich maker and then we make our pizzas in the regular oven.

2239
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:13,760
So this is very good.

2240
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:15,920
I like the idea of this compared to other girls.

2241
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:18,159
It's a lot different variety of foods that you can cook,

2242
01:58:18,159 --> 01:58:20,640
whereas the others just sort of limited to certain things.

2243
01:58:20,640 --> 01:58:26,880
I'm a vegetarian and so it would be really easy for us to make it just like his neck muscles up.

2244
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:29,119
It's just nice to be able to get something done for the whole family

2245
01:58:29,119 --> 01:58:31,359
all at once instead of having to break it down into little pieces.

2246
01:58:31,359 --> 01:58:33,520
So everybody can sit down and eat at the same time.

2247
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:34,640
I'm too busy to talk.

2248
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:35,920
I'm eating the delicious food.

2249
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:38,399
Oh, that was a bump.

2250
01:58:38,399 --> 01:58:40,079
I can't wait to get this for my dorm room.

2251
01:58:40,079 --> 01:58:42,319
I can make like waffles in the morning and eggs.

2252
01:58:42,399 --> 01:58:43,199
I envy this.

2253
01:58:43,199 --> 01:58:44,560
Watch, make some pizza.

2254
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:45,760
Don't get some hot dogs.

2255
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:48,159
My room is going to be the life of every party.

2256
01:58:48,159 --> 01:58:51,359
I'm a tall big guy and I definitely like eating burgers.

2257
01:58:51,359 --> 01:58:52,720
Nice large burgers.

2258
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:55,119
The executive is so perfect for that.

2259
01:58:55,119 --> 01:58:56,159
Cookies, pizza.

2260
01:58:56,159 --> 01:58:57,119
Perfect for the executive.

2261
01:58:57,119 --> 01:58:58,720
Burgers, waffles.

2262
01:58:58,720 --> 01:59:00,000
The best thing in the world.

2263
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:05,279
See, as far as I know that I wish nothing on the market that cooks frozen steaks.

2264
01:59:05,279 --> 01:59:06,800
Are those frozen, buddy?

2265
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:07,439
Get out of there.

2266
01:59:07,439 --> 01:59:08,239
Yeah, those are frozen.

2267
01:59:08,239 --> 01:59:09,600
Okay, get them out there.

2268
01:59:09,600 --> 01:59:10,800
What's going on with the music here?

2269
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:14,399
I could finally hear them talking to each other.

2270
01:59:15,039 --> 01:59:18,399
I was like, oh, this is like better somehow, right?

2271
01:59:18,399 --> 01:59:20,560
When this came back, wasn't it like, oh, cool, nice.

2272
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:21,840
They're talking to each other.

2273
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:26,439
As far as I know, there is nothing on the market that cooks frozen steaks.

2274
01:59:26,439 --> 01:59:27,479
Are those frozen, buddy?

2275
01:59:28,520 --> 01:59:29,399
Yeah, those are frozen.

2276
01:59:29,399 --> 01:59:30,920
Okay, get them out there.

2277
01:59:30,920 --> 01:59:31,399
Geez.

2278
01:59:31,399 --> 01:59:33,800
Now, what we're going to do is we're going to unlock the back.

2279
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:34,439
These are frozen.

2280
01:59:35,319 --> 01:59:37,319
We're going to unlock the back of the grill.

2281
01:59:37,319 --> 01:59:39,239
Two inch frozen steaks.

2282
01:59:39,239 --> 01:59:41,159
They certainly are and we're going to put them on here.

2283
01:59:42,680 --> 01:59:43,640
Those are frozen.

2284
01:59:43,640 --> 01:59:44,760
Now, I know you like them.

2285
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:46,439
Yeah, they are very frozen.

2286
01:59:46,439 --> 01:59:48,119
I'm going to take a couple of potatoes.

2287
01:59:48,119 --> 01:59:50,439
I'm going to put them on here with it because they're frozen.

2288
01:59:50,439 --> 01:59:51,960
They're going to get up at the same time.

2289
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:52,920
They're going to cook perfectly.

2290
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:56,840
In about 20 minutes, you're going to have perfectly cooked steaks.

2291
01:59:56,840 --> 01:59:58,359
Those aren't even the same shape.

2292
01:59:58,359 --> 02:00:02,680
Here's how we turned the ultimate grill into the ultimate party buffet warmer.

2293
02:00:02,680 --> 02:00:03,159
Party buffet.

2294
02:00:03,159 --> 02:00:04,600
Again, we opened it double.

2295
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:06,520
In this case, I used two griddle plates.

2296
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:07,880
You can use a griddle and a grill.

2297
02:00:08,439 --> 02:00:10,760
I turned the dual heat settings down to warm.

2298
02:00:10,760 --> 02:00:13,560
Now, we have 10 of your favorite orders.

2299
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:14,680
No, I don't say that.

2300
02:00:14,680 --> 02:00:15,079
I don't know.

2301
02:00:15,079 --> 02:00:15,960
All you have to do is come in and enjoy.

2302
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:16,520
It's going to keep it warm.

2303
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:17,000
I don't know.

2304
02:00:17,479 --> 02:00:18,119
I don't know.

2305
02:00:18,119 --> 02:00:18,680
Okay.

2306
02:00:18,680 --> 02:00:26,279
Open or closed, big or small, fresh or frozen, Paul Hogan's ultimate grill truly does it all, brother.

2307
02:00:26,279 --> 02:00:27,560
I can't wait to see this.

2308
02:00:27,560 --> 02:00:28,199
But wait a minute.

2309
02:00:28,199 --> 02:00:32,279
It hasn't done its all yet because I haven't even showed you your favorite thing, waffles.

2310
02:00:32,279 --> 02:00:33,960
And I know you like Mexican food.

2311
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:35,239
How about quesadillas?

2312
02:00:35,239 --> 02:00:35,479
What?

2313
02:00:35,479 --> 02:00:36,359
Let me come back.

2314
02:00:36,359 --> 02:00:38,199
Oh, I'm on the edge of my seat right now.

2315
02:00:38,199 --> 02:00:38,840
On the market.

2316
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:41,880
Some of them may drain the grease, but don't cook the meat evenly.

2317
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:45,159
And the cleanup is a mess introducing Paul Hogan.

2318
02:00:45,159 --> 02:00:49,000
Thank God there's something to finally call to it because it's extra large interchangeable

2319
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:52,920
plates easily transforms your Hulk Hogan grill into a skillet waffle.

2320
02:00:52,920 --> 02:00:53,640
All right, we get it.

2321
02:00:53,640 --> 02:00:54,119
We get it.

2322
02:00:54,119 --> 02:00:54,840
We know we get it.

2323
02:00:55,560 --> 02:00:57,079
Show me the show me the duo again, please.

2324
02:00:58,680 --> 02:01:05,479
Hi, guys.

2325
02:01:05,479 --> 02:01:06,600
Welcome back.

2326
02:01:06,600 --> 02:01:12,600
Bob and I just showed you how my ultimate grill replaced over $1,200 with a professional kitchen

2327
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:13,319
appliances.

2328
02:01:13,319 --> 02:01:14,439
All right, we're not done yet.

2329
02:01:14,439 --> 02:01:15,960
We can't do quesadillas.

2330
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:21,800
Well, remember just before we left, we put two two and a half inch frozen steaks in here

2331
02:01:21,800 --> 02:01:23,079
along with a couple of potatoes.

2332
02:01:23,079 --> 02:01:24,119
Let's see how they came out.

2333
02:01:24,119 --> 02:01:24,920
Are you ready?

2334
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:26,520
Boomer century video.

2335
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:28,199
Take a look at that.

2336
02:01:28,199 --> 02:01:30,359
Well, here's the deal with the frozen steaks.

2337
02:01:30,359 --> 02:01:35,239
Yeah, I've never seen or heard of anybody cooking frozen steaks and getting them totally

2338
02:01:35,239 --> 02:01:35,960
perfect.

2339
02:01:35,960 --> 02:01:37,640
Even cook perfectly on the inside.

2340
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:38,680
Well, let's just see.

2341
02:01:38,680 --> 02:01:43,239
This is just the way you would just thought that juice

2342
02:01:43,479 --> 02:01:43,880
look at that.

2343
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:44,520
Now, that's what I call it.

2344
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:46,760
It's always about the juiciness of the steak, right?

2345
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:49,560
It's always like, look, I'm going to press and it's because we have juice is going to

2346
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:51,560
come up at the same time.

2347
02:01:54,239 --> 02:01:57,520
They care more about how much water is coming out of cheese sandwiches.

2348
02:01:57,520 --> 02:01:59,760
I love grilled cheese, but you told me you had a problem with it.

2349
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:03,920
It's never get the center finished the same time the outer edges do.

2350
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:06,399
And I always make a mess and I always burn them.

2351
02:02:06,399 --> 02:02:09,520
Well, how about if I told you we're going to make these grilled cheese sandwiches, four

2352
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:13,039
of them oversized, by the way, as you can see, in about 30 seconds.

2353
02:02:13,039 --> 02:02:14,159
All right, 30 seconds.

2354
02:02:14,239 --> 02:02:16,319
Now, the way we're going to do that is we're going to use pressure.

2355
02:02:17,359 --> 02:02:18,239
Give it a press.

2356
02:02:18,239 --> 02:02:19,359
It locks in place.

2357
02:02:19,359 --> 02:02:20,159
30 seconds.

2358
02:02:20,159 --> 02:02:21,279
Are you counting?

2359
02:02:21,279 --> 02:02:21,520
All right.

2360
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:28,520
But a grilled cheese is like a grilled cheese is very easy to make.

2361
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:29,720
It's very easy.

2362
02:02:32,060 --> 02:02:32,939
What is he saying here?

2363
02:02:32,939 --> 02:02:37,899
Problem with it can never get the center finished the same time the outer edges do.

2364
02:02:37,899 --> 02:02:40,300
And I always make a mess and I always burn them.

2365
02:02:41,020 --> 02:02:44,750
But I fucking love Paul Cogan.

2366
02:02:44,829 --> 02:02:48,109
How about if I told you we're going to make these grilled cheese sandwiches, four of them

2367
02:02:48,109 --> 02:02:51,229
oversized, by the way, as you can see, in about 30 seconds.

2368
02:02:51,229 --> 02:02:52,510
Always, man.

2369
02:02:52,510 --> 02:02:52,989
Always.

2370
02:02:54,029 --> 02:02:55,710
You burn it every time.

2371
02:02:56,350 --> 02:02:59,149
I'm imagining this is like, oh, well, I want to make grilled cheese sandwich.

2372
02:02:59,149 --> 02:03:00,029
I burnt it again.

2373
02:03:00,670 --> 02:03:02,029
I burn it every time.

2374
02:03:02,989 --> 02:03:03,710
Turn the heat down.

2375
02:03:05,439 --> 02:03:06,319
Give it a press.

2376
02:03:06,319 --> 02:03:07,439
It locks in place.

2377
02:03:07,439 --> 02:03:08,159
30 seconds.

2378
02:03:08,159 --> 02:03:08,640
Are you counting?

2379
02:03:08,640 --> 02:03:09,439
30 seconds.

2380
02:03:09,439 --> 02:03:11,199
I'm getting ready to call you out on this one.

2381
02:03:12,159 --> 02:03:13,199
Here we go.

2382
02:03:13,199 --> 02:03:14,079
But we don't know how much.

2383
02:03:14,079 --> 02:03:14,560
Wow.

2384
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:15,359
How about that?

2385
02:03:16,560 --> 02:03:18,159
Now, that was 30 seconds.

2386
02:03:18,159 --> 02:03:21,359
We've got molten cheese sandwiches inside.

2387
02:03:21,359 --> 02:03:21,920
Molten.

2388
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:25,039
Now, the true test is if they're the same all the way through.

2389
02:03:26,159 --> 02:03:27,279
I get his point, though.

2390
02:03:29,439 --> 02:03:31,279
They're too hot for me to handle.

2391
02:03:31,279 --> 02:03:33,760
And just take a look at that.

2392
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:34,640
How about that?

2393
02:03:34,640 --> 02:03:35,279
Let me see that.

2394
02:03:35,279 --> 02:03:36,239
Okay, grab a bite.

2395
02:03:36,239 --> 02:03:36,640
Now, careful.

2396
02:03:36,640 --> 02:03:40,960
Don't burn yourself because they are hot, hot, hot, hot sandwiches right now.

2397
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:42,079
Instant replay.

2398
02:03:42,079 --> 02:03:44,640
Just in case you want to see those grill marks.

2399
02:03:44,640 --> 02:03:48,640
I wanted someone to explain to me here.

2400
02:03:48,640 --> 02:03:52,680
What is the obsession with the grill marks?

2401
02:03:52,680 --> 02:03:55,439
Oh, but look, it's got grill marks on it now.

2402
02:03:55,439 --> 02:03:58,569
Who fucking cares?

2403
02:03:58,569 --> 02:03:59,609
Who cares?

2404
02:03:59,609 --> 02:04:05,550
Dude, it's a hot dog and it tastes exactly the same, but this time it's got grill marks on it.

2405
02:04:05,550 --> 02:04:07,949
Okay, who cares?

2406
02:04:07,949 --> 02:04:14,600
Why is that such a huge, huge selling point?

2407
02:04:14,600 --> 02:04:16,920
Yeah, it's somebody just said it's just a racing stripe.

2408
02:04:17,079 --> 02:04:25,260
The grill marks on a real grill, it's like, okay, you're cooking on a fire or with propane or

2409
02:04:26,300 --> 02:04:26,779
charcoal.

2410
02:04:26,779 --> 02:04:31,789
Is it having just like a grate that makes marks on your food doesn't make it cooked on a grill,

2411
02:04:31,789 --> 02:04:34,029
like doesn't make it cooked on like a charcoal grill.

2412
02:04:34,029 --> 02:04:36,670
It's like pretending it adds texture.

2413
02:04:36,670 --> 02:04:37,229
Not really, though.

2414
02:04:37,229 --> 02:04:39,920
A hot dog.

2415
02:04:39,920 --> 02:04:45,739
This is a great time for a party that if you're going that way, all right, give it a press.

2416
02:04:45,739 --> 02:04:49,899
It'll snap into place and those hot dogs are going to be like, oh, they're going to be like,

2417
02:04:49,899 --> 02:04:53,100
snap into place and those hot dogs are going to be done in about two minutes.

2418
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:54,220
It adds swag.

2419
02:04:54,939 --> 02:04:56,699
Hey, look at that.

2420
02:04:56,699 --> 02:04:57,500
It's party time.

2421
02:04:57,500 --> 02:04:58,779
It's party time.

2422
02:04:58,779 --> 02:05:00,300
Just roll it right out.

2423
02:05:00,939 --> 02:05:03,500
Oh, if only you had that canvas scooper.

2424
02:05:03,500 --> 02:05:05,579
If only you had the canvas scooper, you'd be just fine.

2425
02:05:05,579 --> 02:05:06,380
What was it called again?

2426
02:05:07,899 --> 02:05:09,039
The hammock grabber.

2427
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:15,130
I love the instant replay.

2428
02:05:20,619 --> 02:05:23,659
I cook shrimp and steak and it's done quickly.

2429
02:05:23,659 --> 02:05:25,020
There's enough for everybody.

2430
02:05:25,020 --> 02:05:25,979
We take it to the beach.

2431
02:05:25,979 --> 02:05:27,100
We take it to a cabin.

2432
02:05:27,739 --> 02:05:30,060
And it's done and steak and it's done.

2433
02:05:30,779 --> 02:05:32,060
He's not sure about this.

2434
02:05:32,060 --> 02:05:32,619
Quickly.

2435
02:05:32,619 --> 02:05:33,500
There's enough for everybody.

2436
02:05:37,579 --> 02:05:38,939
We take it to the beach.

2437
02:05:38,939 --> 02:05:39,979
We take it to a cabin.

2438
02:05:39,979 --> 02:05:42,060
And the cleanup is so simple and easy.

2439
02:05:42,060 --> 02:05:43,340
It's the ultimate grill.

2440
02:05:43,340 --> 02:05:45,659
We love to have our friends over and to entertain.

2441
02:05:45,659 --> 02:05:48,699
And in the past, it was bringing out the hors d'oeuvres from the oven,

2442
02:05:48,699 --> 02:05:49,819
putting them on the tray.

2443
02:05:49,819 --> 02:05:50,859
They would get cold.

2444
02:05:50,859 --> 02:05:53,420
He's like, now with the whole cold and ultimate grill,

2445
02:05:53,420 --> 02:05:55,260
we put all the hors d'oeuvres in one place.

2446
02:05:55,260 --> 02:05:56,460
They stay warm.

2447
02:05:56,460 --> 02:05:59,100
And we have enough time to spend with our friends.

2448
02:05:59,100 --> 02:06:00,699
That's an application for this.

2449
02:06:02,090 --> 02:06:04,250
Having like it's served but on low heat.

2450
02:06:04,250 --> 02:06:06,960
I could see that as kind of like a party tray sister

2451
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:08,960
because shit does get cold.

2452
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:10,079
I could see that.

2453
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:14,699
This is an application for this.

2454
02:06:17,340 --> 02:06:21,239
What kind of waffles do you like?

2455
02:06:21,239 --> 02:06:23,000
Well, not this kind.

2456
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:24,279
It's too small.

2457
02:06:24,840 --> 02:06:26,439
I like big golden brown.

2458
02:06:26,439 --> 02:06:27,239
Perfect waffles.

2459
02:06:27,239 --> 02:06:27,960
Fluffy and big.

2460
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:29,479
Well, this is a professional waffle maker.

2461
02:06:29,479 --> 02:06:30,199
It costs $90.

2462
02:06:30,199 --> 02:06:30,920
What's wrong with that?

2463
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:34,039
Job of making waffles, but this is how much waffles it makes.

2464
02:06:34,039 --> 02:06:35,720
So what we did with the ultimate grill,

2465
02:06:35,720 --> 02:06:37,640
remember, we give you interchangeable plates.

2466
02:06:37,640 --> 02:06:41,880
These are optional to your Hulk Hogan grill.

2467
02:06:41,880 --> 02:06:45,079
So all we do now is we swap out by pushing the button here

2468
02:06:45,079 --> 02:06:45,560
and here.

2469
02:06:45,560 --> 02:06:47,159
I love Hulk Hogan.

2470
02:06:47,159 --> 02:06:48,600
Your waffle plates.

2471
02:06:48,600 --> 02:06:51,720
Now Hulk Hogan is like a real Superman.

2472
02:06:51,720 --> 02:06:55,079
This is the same amount exactly of batter as that reason.

2473
02:06:55,079 --> 02:06:55,399
Hold on.

2474
02:06:55,399 --> 02:06:55,960
Pause, Andy.

2475
02:06:55,960 --> 02:06:57,960
I know the reason why I used to love wrestling

2476
02:06:57,960 --> 02:07:00,520
is because Hulk Hogan was a real superhero.

2477
02:07:00,520 --> 02:07:05,840
He was in real life, like the ultimate warrior macho man.

2478
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:08,409
These guys were superheroes.

2479
02:07:08,409 --> 02:07:10,409
I saw Hulk Hogan not as a wrestler,

2480
02:07:10,409 --> 02:07:12,569
but as like Captain America, essentially.

2481
02:07:14,989 --> 02:07:15,710
I loved it.

2482
02:07:15,710 --> 02:07:18,029
It was just like, wow, there he is, like a superhero.

2483
02:07:18,829 --> 02:07:20,909
He like fights for good.

2484
02:07:20,909 --> 02:07:21,869
He was like Captain America.

2485
02:07:21,869 --> 02:07:23,789
So that's one professional machine's worth,

2486
02:07:23,789 --> 02:07:25,789
two professional machines worth, three professional machines worth.

2487
02:07:25,789 --> 02:07:27,789
This grill got recalled.

2488
02:07:27,789 --> 02:07:28,189
Wait a minute.

2489
02:07:28,189 --> 02:07:29,710
You said that was a $90 machine?

2490
02:07:29,710 --> 02:07:30,670
That was a $90 machine.

2491
02:07:30,670 --> 02:07:31,310
We're going to do four.

2492
02:07:31,310 --> 02:07:32,750
So we're making four waffles at the same time.

2493
02:07:32,750 --> 02:07:35,630
So that's like having a $360 machine right here.

2494
02:07:35,630 --> 02:07:36,829
Well, we're going to see how they come out,

2495
02:07:36,829 --> 02:07:38,189
but they're going to be absolutely perfect.

2496
02:07:38,189 --> 02:07:39,630
Give your machine a little love.

2497
02:07:39,630 --> 02:07:40,109
Press it.

2498
02:07:40,109 --> 02:07:41,390
Now we've got the pressure in there.

2499
02:07:41,390 --> 02:07:43,310
We know that we're set at 375.

2500
02:07:43,310 --> 02:07:44,350
Top and bottom.

2501
02:07:44,350 --> 02:07:45,069
They're going to come out good.

2502
02:07:45,069 --> 02:07:45,869
We finally read it.

2503
02:07:47,069 --> 02:07:48,829
Let's see how are we done with our waffle.

2504
02:07:48,829 --> 02:07:49,630
Really?

2505
02:07:49,630 --> 02:07:49,949
Beautiful.

2506
02:07:49,949 --> 02:07:51,390
How about that?

2507
02:07:51,390 --> 02:07:53,149
Now, is that an ordinary waffle?

2508
02:07:56,989 --> 02:07:58,750
What's going on?

2509
02:07:58,750 --> 02:07:59,630
I just bought a piece of the pizza.

2510
02:07:59,630 --> 02:08:00,350
It was really good.

2511
02:08:00,350 --> 02:08:03,550
I can't believe how crispy the pizza was on the bottom.

2512
02:08:03,550 --> 02:08:04,109
Does it not?

2513
02:08:04,109 --> 02:08:05,310
Yeah, remember the crispy pizza?

2514
02:08:05,310 --> 02:08:07,710
The secret is the ultimate grill cooks with mechanical pressure.

2515
02:08:07,789 --> 02:08:10,590
Just lock the lid, instantly searing it off it.

2516
02:08:10,590 --> 02:08:12,829
You'll love your Hulk Hogan ultimate grill.

2517
02:08:12,829 --> 02:08:15,390
I'm not going to give you a 30-day money back guarantee.

2518
02:08:15,390 --> 02:08:17,869
I'm going to give you a 60-day money back guarantee.

2519
02:08:17,869 --> 02:08:18,430
I love that.

2520
02:08:18,430 --> 02:08:20,750
Because I'm putting my name on it.

2521
02:08:20,750 --> 02:08:23,390
When you call, ask your operators how you can get the waffle.

2522
02:08:24,750 --> 02:08:25,310
Oh, cookies.

2523
02:08:25,310 --> 02:08:26,350
We're going to say this.

2524
02:08:26,350 --> 02:08:27,710
Cookie baking machine.

2525
02:08:27,710 --> 02:08:29,390
Now we can do little cookies.

2526
02:08:29,390 --> 02:08:30,430
Those are huge cookies.

2527
02:08:30,430 --> 02:08:31,630
Now that's a little cookie.

2528
02:08:31,630 --> 02:08:34,270
In here, we got a Hawks.

2529
02:08:34,270 --> 02:08:34,770
Whoa.

2530
02:08:35,729 --> 02:08:37,890
Now, want to decorate that?

2531
02:08:37,890 --> 02:08:38,770
Nobody's going to.

2532
02:08:38,770 --> 02:08:39,489
That's too big.

2533
02:08:39,489 --> 02:08:40,689
I put my smile and face on the whole thing.

2534
02:08:40,689 --> 02:08:42,050
That's just a pancake.

2535
02:08:42,050 --> 02:08:44,210
I've bought cookies the size of the grocery store.

2536
02:08:44,210 --> 02:08:45,489
And they're like $40.

2537
02:08:45,489 --> 02:08:47,170
If I bought three or four or five cookies.

2538
02:08:47,170 --> 02:08:48,130
That's a pancake.

2539
02:08:48,130 --> 02:08:49,409
That would pay for my whole machine.

2540
02:08:49,409 --> 02:08:49,890
That's crazy.

2541
02:08:49,890 --> 02:08:52,510
There you go.

2542
02:08:52,510 --> 02:08:55,390
Wait, did you say that buying three cookies at the grocery store?

2543
02:08:55,390 --> 02:08:58,350
Because not only does it make a ton of delicious meals,

2544
02:08:58,350 --> 02:09:02,270
I can also make a giant cookie and surprise my kids and my whole family.

2545
02:09:02,270 --> 02:09:04,109
Now everyone wants a cookie.

2546
02:09:04,189 --> 02:09:06,989
Our family absolutely loves quesadillas.

2547
02:09:06,989 --> 02:09:08,109
What's with the cookie thing?

2548
02:09:08,109 --> 02:09:08,989
It's fast.

2549
02:09:08,989 --> 02:09:09,869
It's fun.

2550
02:09:09,869 --> 02:09:11,470
The kids have a bowl making it.

2551
02:09:11,470 --> 02:09:14,510
And we know we're getting something good when we're eating at home.

2552
02:09:14,510 --> 02:09:15,229
That looks pretty good.

2553
02:09:15,229 --> 02:09:16,029
We love pizza.

2554
02:09:16,029 --> 02:09:19,710
And as a family of five, the whole family can make pizza together.

2555
02:09:19,710 --> 02:09:21,390
And we can have dinner on the table.

2556
02:09:21,390 --> 02:09:24,590
And I've bought a ton of quesadillas.

2557
02:09:24,590 --> 02:09:25,869
Everybody participates.

2558
02:09:25,869 --> 02:09:27,310
Everyone wants a cookie.

2559
02:09:27,310 --> 02:09:31,170
Our family absolutely loves quesadillas.

2560
02:09:31,729 --> 02:09:37,569
And we know we're getting something good when we're eating at home.

2561
02:09:37,569 --> 02:09:39,090
We love pizza.

2562
02:09:39,090 --> 02:09:44,850
And as a family of five, the whole family can make pizza together.

2563
02:09:44,850 --> 02:09:47,890
And we can have dinner on the table in 15 minutes.

2564
02:09:47,890 --> 02:09:51,649
With fresh ingredients that I bought for a third of the price of pizza,

2565
02:09:51,649 --> 02:09:52,850
Paula pizza.

2566
02:09:52,850 --> 02:09:57,569
Well, I love to make it's big enough.

2567
02:09:57,569 --> 02:09:58,689
It's got a wide surface.

2568
02:09:58,689 --> 02:10:00,850
I could put two large paninis on there.

2569
02:10:00,850 --> 02:10:02,289
And it's done in like three minutes.

2570
02:10:04,050 --> 02:10:06,050
Everybody lives in the same house.

2571
02:10:06,050 --> 02:10:07,409
How big is this house?

2572
02:10:07,409 --> 02:10:08,210
Sausage on there.

2573
02:10:08,210 --> 02:10:10,449
We can make waffles, pancakes.

2574
02:10:10,449 --> 02:10:11,170
Dude, I'm sorry.

2575
02:10:11,170 --> 02:10:14,289
Only so many people can use the Hulk Hogan grill at 8 o'clock in the morning.

2576
02:10:16,180 --> 02:10:20,180
I promise you guys, you're going to be so happy with Hulk Hogan's ultimate grill.

2577
02:10:20,180 --> 02:10:22,100
You're going to use it each and every day.

2578
02:10:22,100 --> 02:10:25,300
It's the ultimate cookie maker, the ultimate panini sandwich press,

2579
02:10:25,300 --> 02:10:27,460
the ultimate pizza oven, the ultimate grill.

2580
02:10:27,460 --> 02:10:28,899
The ultimate cookie maker.

2581
02:10:29,380 --> 02:10:31,220
The ultimate quesadilla maker.

2582
02:10:31,220 --> 02:10:32,500
The ultimate waffle maker.

2583
02:10:32,500 --> 02:10:37,140
And it's the ultimate grill, which truly makes it the ultimate kitchen appliance.

2584
02:10:37,140 --> 02:10:41,699
So big or small, open or closed, fresh or frozen,

2585
02:10:41,699 --> 02:10:44,739
Hulk Hogan's ultimate grill does it all, brother.

2586
02:10:45,539 --> 02:10:46,819
Thank you so much.

2587
02:10:46,819 --> 02:10:47,699
We're a champ.

2588
02:10:47,699 --> 02:10:49,060
Let's go practice our wrestling now.

2589
02:10:49,060 --> 02:10:50,020
Come on, I need some help.

2590
02:10:50,979 --> 02:10:55,180
Hulk is going to go wrestle this guy?

2591
02:10:55,180 --> 02:10:57,600
He's going to go kick the shit out of this guy.

2592
02:10:57,600 --> 02:11:00,640
Hulk Hogan's ultimate grill does it all, brother.

2593
02:11:01,359 --> 02:11:02,720
Yeah, like, is he saying that?

2594
02:11:02,720 --> 02:11:03,600
We're a champ.

2595
02:11:03,600 --> 02:11:04,960
Let's go practice our wrestling now.

2596
02:11:04,960 --> 02:11:05,920
Come on, I need some help.

2597
02:11:06,720 --> 02:11:08,479
Is he saying that to production?

2598
02:11:08,479 --> 02:11:11,439
Like, guys, I'm going to need help over here on the right.

2599
02:11:12,939 --> 02:11:16,420
He's talking to production.

2600
02:11:16,420 --> 02:11:18,180
Grill does it all, brother.

2601
02:11:18,979 --> 02:11:20,260
Thank you so much.

2602
02:11:20,260 --> 02:11:21,140
We're a champ.

2603
02:11:21,140 --> 02:11:22,420
Let's go practice our wrestling now.

2604
02:11:22,420 --> 02:11:23,460
Come on, I need some help.

2605
02:11:28,939 --> 02:11:31,659
I don't know, what an enjoyable experience that was.

2606
02:11:33,489 --> 02:11:34,609
The ultimate grill.

2607
02:11:34,609 --> 02:11:35,810
Hulk's ultimate grill.

2608
02:11:37,310 --> 02:11:38,029
All right, what's what I got?

2609
02:11:39,500 --> 02:11:40,060
Oh, there's more.

2610
02:11:45,310 --> 02:11:48,050
We were back here.

2611
02:11:48,050 --> 02:11:49,489
All right, perfect meatloaf.

2612
02:11:51,100 --> 02:11:53,100
By the way, I hope everyone understands.

2613
02:11:55,810 --> 02:11:57,569
I'm doing this more often.

2614
02:11:57,569 --> 02:12:01,229
I'm doing this way more often.

2615
02:12:03,060 --> 02:12:04,659
There's so many things to watch.

2616
02:12:04,659 --> 02:12:05,859
There's so many products to watch.

2617
02:12:05,859 --> 02:12:09,340
I was just testing it today to see if this was fun.

2618
02:12:09,340 --> 02:12:11,739
Absolutely.

2619
02:12:11,739 --> 02:12:12,460
We're doing this again.

2620
02:12:12,460 --> 02:12:13,739
This is, like, amazing.

2621
02:12:13,739 --> 02:12:14,460
This is so much fun.

2622
02:12:15,340 --> 02:12:16,460
I love watching this stuff.

2623
02:12:16,460 --> 02:12:18,619
And I'm so glad that I can share it with you

2624
02:12:18,619 --> 02:12:22,159
because I would lie in bed, put some of these on.

2625
02:12:22,159 --> 02:12:24,880
I haven't seen any of these ones, but, I mean, maybe I have.

2626
02:12:24,880 --> 02:12:25,840
Maybe I haven't.

2627
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:28,140
But I would just sit there and, like, think these things.

2628
02:12:29,789 --> 02:12:32,850
I want to just talk about it.

2629
02:12:32,850 --> 02:12:35,710
So, yeah, we'll do this again.

2630
02:12:35,710 --> 02:12:37,789
Okay, what about the perfect meatloaf plus?

2631
02:12:37,789 --> 02:12:39,229
We've seen meatloaf before.

2632
02:12:39,229 --> 02:12:45,579
Growing up, my family made the most amazing meatloaf.

2633
02:12:45,579 --> 02:12:47,180
But we had a secret.

2634
02:12:47,180 --> 02:12:50,140
Look, delicious seasoned beef on the outside.

2635
02:12:50,140 --> 02:12:54,060
And, oh, boy, loaded baked potatoes on the inside.

2636
02:12:54,060 --> 02:12:55,020
How they do it?

2637
02:12:55,020 --> 02:12:57,180
It's the perfect meatloaf plus.

2638
02:12:57,180 --> 02:12:59,739
The new non-stick way to bake and serve the perfect meatloaf.

2639
02:12:59,739 --> 02:13:01,340
A baked potato on the inside?

2640
02:13:01,340 --> 02:13:01,819
Watch.

2641
02:13:01,819 --> 02:13:03,420
Add your favorite meat to the pan.

2642
02:13:03,420 --> 02:13:04,699
Press to make an opening.

2643
02:13:04,699 --> 02:13:05,180
Pop in your favorite stuffing.

2644
02:13:05,180 --> 02:13:06,699
And all more of this stuffed shit.

2645
02:13:06,699 --> 02:13:07,979
Now seal and bake.

2646
02:13:07,979 --> 02:13:09,739
You don't need, you don't stuff a meatloaf.

2647
02:13:09,739 --> 02:13:11,340
You just made a yummy cold cut stuffed meatloaf.

2648
02:13:11,340 --> 02:13:11,840
Cool.

2649
02:13:11,840 --> 02:13:13,180
The main choices inside are endless.

2650
02:13:13,180 --> 02:13:14,060
What?

2651
02:13:14,060 --> 02:13:15,659
Like asparagus caught on blue.

2652
02:13:15,659 --> 02:13:16,220
That was real.

2653
02:13:16,220 --> 02:13:16,699
You heard that.

2654
02:13:16,699 --> 02:13:19,340
And then loaded pizza, vegetable medley, even ooey gooey.

2655
02:13:19,340 --> 02:13:20,460
Did you guys hear that?

2656
02:13:20,460 --> 02:13:21,979
Now that's delicioso.

2657
02:13:21,979 --> 02:13:24,779
All made simple with our easy press and sealer.

2658
02:13:24,859 --> 02:13:27,979
Best of all, my old country elevates your meatloaf.

2659
02:13:27,979 --> 02:13:31,579
So all the oils and fats drain away, making it healthier.

2660
02:13:31,579 --> 02:13:33,739
Why make crumbly, boring meatloaf?

2661
02:13:33,739 --> 02:13:34,779
They use that same image.

2662
02:13:34,779 --> 02:13:36,859
Moist, delicious stuffed meatloaf.

2663
02:13:36,859 --> 02:13:38,779
Just like my Aunt Nancy makes.

2664
02:13:38,779 --> 02:13:40,380
Which like my Aunt Nancy makes.

2665
02:13:40,380 --> 02:13:41,340
Moist, delicious.

2666
02:13:43,739 --> 02:13:56,430
Nancy's meatloaf is an egg, spinach, cheese, and like bananas?

2667
02:13:56,430 --> 02:14:00,479
Are these like maintains?

2668
02:14:02,159 --> 02:14:04,239
Stuffed meatloaf, just like my Aunt Nancy makes.

2669
02:14:04,239 --> 02:14:05,119
What's in there?

2670
02:14:05,119 --> 02:14:07,279
With my superior nonstick surface.

2671
02:14:07,279 --> 02:14:09,199
Just lift, slide, and serve.

2672
02:14:09,199 --> 02:14:10,640
No messy cleanups.

2673
02:14:10,640 --> 02:14:13,920
Imagine beef meatloaf with stuffed manicotti.

2674
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:16,319
Turkey with Thanksgiving Day stuffing.

2675
02:14:16,319 --> 02:14:17,359
Or chicken with portobello mushrooms.

2676
02:14:17,359 --> 02:14:18,000
All right, I'd eat that one.

2677
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:18,960
I'd eat that one.

2678
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:22,159
You can also do cornbread, pull apart cinnamon bread,

2679
02:14:22,159 --> 02:14:23,760
even strawberry shortcake.

2680
02:14:23,760 --> 02:14:24,960
I'd eat the turkey one.

2681
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:25,920
Plus it's all dishwasher safe.

2682
02:14:25,920 --> 02:14:28,399
Other pans sell for up to $40.

2683
02:14:28,399 --> 02:14:29,600
And they don't even have a lifting tray or easy press.

2684
02:14:29,600 --> 02:14:31,199
You should try these and do reviews on them.

2685
02:14:31,199 --> 02:14:32,239
But order right now.

2686
02:14:32,239 --> 02:14:33,680
I can already tell you all the reviews.

2687
02:14:33,680 --> 02:14:35,439
Is only $14.95.

2688
02:14:35,439 --> 02:14:36,800
I can already tell you that each one of these

2689
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:37,680
is going to be like a mess.

2690
02:14:37,680 --> 02:14:38,880
And I'm just going to be like, I don't like this.

2691
02:14:39,520 --> 02:14:43,039
OK.

2692
02:14:43,039 --> 02:14:45,279
The pasta-fina.

2693
02:14:45,279 --> 02:14:50,189
Pasta-fina.

2694
02:14:50,189 --> 02:14:53,470
To make pasta on the stove, you boil, stir, and toil.

2695
02:14:53,470 --> 02:14:54,510
And watch out.

2696
02:14:54,510 --> 02:14:55,869
It's sure to make a mess.

2697
02:14:55,869 --> 02:14:56,670
Then you strain.

2698
02:14:58,029 --> 02:14:59,310
That first is trashed.

2699
02:14:59,310 --> 02:15:00,029
Pasta is not a choice.

2700
02:15:00,029 --> 02:15:00,829
Then you strain.

2701
02:15:00,829 --> 02:15:01,630
Make a mess.

2702
02:15:01,630 --> 02:15:02,350
Then you strain.

2703
02:15:02,989 --> 02:15:04,829
Why would you dump the whole thing up?

2704
02:15:04,829 --> 02:15:05,789
Make a mess.

2705
02:15:05,869 --> 02:15:06,909
It's balancing.

2706
02:15:07,470 --> 02:15:08,510
It's balancing.

2707
02:15:09,779 --> 02:15:13,470
On the edge of the sink.

2708
02:15:13,470 --> 02:15:15,789
And you dump the whole thing into it.

2709
02:15:16,750 --> 02:15:18,670
This person is trashed.

2710
02:15:18,670 --> 02:15:20,029
Or they're, yeah, wicked high.

2711
02:15:22,350 --> 02:15:24,109
And the thing is, what they should show is,

2712
02:15:24,109 --> 02:15:26,350
they should show, like, they should cut to the person's,

2713
02:15:26,350 --> 02:15:26,989
like, over here.

2714
02:15:27,630 --> 02:15:30,109
And just have them be like, with these red eyes.

2715
02:15:30,109 --> 02:15:33,779
And have them just go, I don't care.

2716
02:15:34,579 --> 02:15:35,859
And then reach into the sink and, like,

2717
02:15:35,859 --> 02:15:38,819
put it back into the strainer and put it on a plate.

2718
02:15:38,819 --> 02:15:39,939
Right, because, I mean, come on.

2719
02:15:41,739 --> 02:15:44,060
Making pasta is not a chore anymore.

2720
02:15:44,060 --> 02:15:45,020
Hi, Chef Tony.

2721
02:15:45,020 --> 02:15:46,380
We've got some Chef Tonys in a row.

2722
02:15:46,380 --> 02:15:50,380
The new way to make great pasta in as little as three minutes.

2723
02:15:50,380 --> 02:15:52,859
Simply add pasta, pour in boiling water,

2724
02:15:52,859 --> 02:15:54,300
and snap on the strainer lid.

2725
02:15:54,300 --> 02:15:54,619
What?

2726
02:15:54,619 --> 02:15:57,739
In no time, Pasta Fina cooks your pasta to perfection

2727
02:15:57,739 --> 02:15:58,939
right before your eyes.

2728
02:15:58,939 --> 02:16:02,300
Pasta Fina's unique vertical design surrounds the pasta

2729
02:16:02,300 --> 02:16:05,739
and uses thermal control to maintain the ideal temperature

2730
02:16:05,739 --> 02:16:06,779
for perfect pasta.

2731
02:16:06,779 --> 02:16:07,340
Does this work?

2732
02:16:07,340 --> 02:16:08,779
Just pop the top and drain.

2733
02:16:08,779 --> 02:16:10,220
No lumps or clumps.

2734
02:16:10,220 --> 02:16:11,020
Spaghetti.

2735
02:16:11,020 --> 02:16:12,060
All right, hold on.

2736
02:16:12,060 --> 02:16:13,020
Rigatoni.

2737
02:16:13,020 --> 02:16:14,140
Ravioli.

2738
02:16:14,140 --> 02:16:14,859
Macaroni.

2739
02:16:14,859 --> 02:16:16,140
Even tortellini.

2740
02:16:16,140 --> 02:16:18,779
All in as little as three minutes without the mess.

2741
02:16:18,779 --> 02:16:20,539
And pasta's just the start.

2742
02:16:20,539 --> 02:16:23,819
If you like veggies, Pasta Fina makes them fast and fresh.

2743
02:16:23,819 --> 02:16:24,460
Does that work?

2744
02:16:24,460 --> 02:16:25,260
Cheese and carrots.

2745
02:16:25,260 --> 02:16:26,220
Asparagus.

2746
02:16:26,220 --> 02:16:28,060
Even mixed vegetable medley.

2747
02:16:28,060 --> 02:16:30,859
And look, we cook broccoli the old fashioned way

2748
02:16:30,859 --> 02:16:32,620
and the Pasta Fina way.

2749
02:16:32,620 --> 02:16:33,979
Look at the water.

2750
02:16:33,979 --> 02:16:36,299
There is all your flavor and your nutrients,

2751
02:16:36,299 --> 02:16:38,139
but not the Pasta Fina way.

2752
02:16:38,139 --> 02:16:39,260
Look at the water.

2753
02:16:39,260 --> 02:16:40,219
Oh, yeah.

2754
02:16:40,219 --> 02:16:41,420
And look at the broccoli.

2755
02:16:41,420 --> 02:16:42,540
What do you mean, look at the water?

2756
02:16:42,540 --> 02:16:44,700
Bright, brilliant, and bursting with flavor.

2757
02:16:44,700 --> 02:16:46,860
Cook veggies and spaghetti at the same time.

2758
02:16:47,819 --> 02:16:49,100
Pasta from Nevada.

2759
02:16:49,100 --> 02:16:51,659
Even cook macaroni and sliced hot dogs together.

2760
02:16:51,659 --> 02:16:52,620
Add cheese.

2761
02:16:52,620 --> 02:16:54,139
Toss for mac and cheese.

2762
02:16:54,139 --> 02:16:55,340
That's sure to please.

2763
02:16:55,340 --> 02:16:58,700
And for cleanup, just a quick rinse or rack it in the dishwasher.

2764
02:16:58,700 --> 02:17:01,739
For a limited time, my Pasta Fina and complete recipe guide

2765
02:17:01,739 --> 02:17:03,899
are yours for just $10.

2766
02:17:03,899 --> 02:17:04,860
But wait, order in the next five minutes.

2767
02:17:04,860 --> 02:17:06,219
But this actually looks kind of useful.

2768
02:17:06,219 --> 02:17:09,340
And we'll send a second Pasta Fina and recipe guide for you

2769
02:17:09,340 --> 02:17:10,459
or to give us a gift.

2770
02:17:10,459 --> 02:17:13,409
Boiling water is annoying, right?

2771
02:17:13,409 --> 02:17:15,329
Let's just be, let's be real.

2772
02:17:15,329 --> 02:17:18,930
Boiling water is annoying.

2773
02:17:18,930 --> 02:17:21,709
It takes like a long time to boil water

2774
02:17:21,709 --> 02:17:24,030
unless you get like a kettle and boil it

2775
02:17:24,030 --> 02:17:24,989
and then pour, you know what I mean?

2776
02:17:24,989 --> 02:17:26,110
It takes a while.

2777
02:17:26,110 --> 02:17:27,790
It's a, this is a plastic tube.

2778
02:17:27,790 --> 02:17:28,110
I don't know.

2779
02:17:30,770 --> 02:17:31,809
It's obviously fake.

2780
02:17:32,770 --> 02:17:33,250
Is it though?

2781
02:17:34,049 --> 02:17:35,250
You have to boil water for this.

2782
02:17:36,989 --> 02:17:37,549
Wait, what?

2783
02:17:39,180 --> 02:17:41,100
Wait, it's not, wait a minute, hold on.

2784
02:17:41,100 --> 02:17:42,860
You boil the water and then pour it in.

2785
02:17:44,540 --> 02:17:45,579
Wait, it's not a machine?

2786
02:17:48,059 --> 02:17:49,659
You do pour in boiling water.

2787
02:17:53,809 --> 02:17:54,770
Oh, I missed that.

2788
02:17:54,770 --> 02:17:57,010
I thought this was like a device that you put the water in

2789
02:17:57,010 --> 02:17:58,930
and put this in and in three minutes you got pasta.

2790
02:18:01,600 --> 02:18:02,239
Okay, all right.

2791
02:18:04,559 --> 02:18:05,840
I thought you like turned it on.

2792
02:18:11,600 --> 02:18:12,159
Okay, all right.

2793
02:18:13,040 --> 02:18:14,799
It's interesting, but I don't think that's going to work.

2794
02:18:16,719 --> 02:18:18,079
All right, what about the fresh and crisp?

2795
02:18:29,579 --> 02:18:31,100
Is it an air freshener for your fridge?

2796
02:18:37,579 --> 02:18:38,299
Hold on.

2797
02:18:38,299 --> 02:18:39,739
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2798
02:18:42,059 --> 02:18:44,260
Why is none of this covered?

2799
02:18:46,420 --> 02:18:48,819
You just open your fridge and just throw a head of open

2800
02:18:48,819 --> 02:18:51,139
just lettuce and a pineapple and like strawberry.

2801
02:18:51,139 --> 02:18:51,780
You don't cover it?

2802
02:18:56,049 --> 02:18:57,250
Why is it in the trash?

2803
02:18:57,250 --> 02:18:59,329
That's like throwing money away.

2804
02:18:59,329 --> 02:19:00,770
You need to put it like you need to cover it

2805
02:19:00,770 --> 02:19:02,450
and put it in like the humidifier thing.

2806
02:19:08,290 --> 02:19:09,170
18 days.

2807
02:19:11,889 --> 02:19:12,930
Just eat the, eat them.

2808
02:19:17,090 --> 02:19:18,930
Strawberries were bought at the same time.

2809
02:19:18,930 --> 02:19:20,129
Just look at the difference.

2810
02:19:20,129 --> 02:19:21,729
Oh, six dollars.

2811
02:19:21,729 --> 02:19:24,290
And look at iceberg lettuce after just eight days.

2812
02:19:24,290 --> 02:19:25,649
Fresh and crisp looks fresh.

2813
02:19:25,649 --> 02:19:27,889
No way that's another 250.

2814
02:19:27,889 --> 02:19:29,329
See the difference in these bananas.

2815
02:19:29,329 --> 02:19:31,729
The bunch stored with fresh and crisp is still fresh.

2816
02:19:31,729 --> 02:19:33,569
Okay, but what is the fresh and crisp?

2817
02:19:33,569 --> 02:19:33,969
What is it?

2818
02:19:34,770 --> 02:19:36,450
Baking soda is not the enemy.

2819
02:19:36,450 --> 02:19:39,090
It's the ethylene gas that's naturally given off

2820
02:19:39,090 --> 02:19:42,850
by fruits and veggies as they age in bags or in the fridge.

2821
02:19:42,850 --> 02:19:45,649
That gas is what makes your produce go bad.

2822
02:19:45,729 --> 02:19:49,010
The secret to fresh and crisp is in its proprietary technology

2823
02:19:49,010 --> 02:19:51,489
that uses mineral-based active ingredients

2824
02:19:51,489 --> 02:19:54,209
to trap and absorb that natural gas.

2825
02:19:54,209 --> 02:19:56,610
Dramatically slowing the aging process.

2826
02:19:56,610 --> 02:19:58,610
And fresh and crisp will last three months.

2827
02:19:58,610 --> 02:19:59,569
Baking soda in the fridge,

2828
02:19:59,569 --> 02:20:01,409
like an open thing of baking soda, they sell them.

2829
02:20:01,409 --> 02:20:04,530
That works for like odor and freshness.

2830
02:20:04,530 --> 02:20:06,370
And you'll save tons of money.

2831
02:20:06,370 --> 02:20:09,329

Right now, we'll also send you fresh and fridge.

2838
02:20:21,250 --> 02:20:23,489
The amazing fridge and freezer odor-eliminating free.

2839
02:20:23,489 --> 02:20:24,450
That's baking soda.

2840
02:20:24,450 --> 02:20:26,610
Just place the fresh and fridge in any location

2841
02:20:26,610 --> 02:20:28,850
in your refrigerator or freezer to remove odors

2842
02:20:28,850 --> 02:20:29,889
and prevent odor cross-contamination on fruits and ice.

2843
02:20:29,889 --> 02:20:32,049
But how long does it last?

2844
02:20:32,049 --> 02:20:34,930
Laboratory tests prove fresh and fridge absorbs odors

2845
02:20:34,930 --> 02:20:37,569
97% more effectively than baking soda.

2846
02:20:37,569 --> 02:20:37,969
Hold on.

2847
02:20:37,969 --> 02:20:40,770
In fact, you'd need an entire fridge full of baking soda

2848
02:20:40,770 --> 02:20:42,850
to do the job of just one fresh and fridge.

2849
02:20:42,850 --> 02:20:44,370
Oh, fuck out of here.

2850
02:20:44,370 --> 02:20:47,010
You get two fresh and crisp produce savers

2851
02:20:47,010 --> 02:20:49,969
and the incredible fresh and fridge odor-eliminator.

2852
02:20:49,969 --> 02:20:51,729
I don't, I'd like to see the science.

2853
02:20:51,729 --> 02:20:52,930
All for just $9.95.

2854
02:20:52,930 --> 02:20:56,049
Call or click to order yours right now.

2855
02:20:56,049 --> 02:20:59,059
I'd like to see the science on that one.

2856
02:20:59,059 --> 02:20:59,860
If it works, cool.

2857
02:20:59,860 --> 02:21:01,139
I'd like to see some of the,

2858
02:21:01,139 --> 02:21:02,659
I'd like to know some of the science on that.

2859
02:21:04,420 --> 02:21:05,860
How about the no spill chill?

2860
02:21:06,979 --> 02:21:09,659
Oops, uh-oh, look out.

2861
02:21:09,659 --> 02:21:11,979
Oops, uh-oh, look out.

2862
02:21:11,979 --> 02:21:14,700
Let's face it, getting an ice cube tray to your freezer

2863
02:21:15,420 --> 02:21:15,920
Shit face.

2864
02:21:20,780 --> 02:21:24,299
The only difference is, this is not regular ice.

2865
02:21:26,219 --> 02:21:27,979
This is like, this person that with it,

2866
02:21:27,979 --> 02:21:29,180
they're just high or they're drunk

2867
02:21:29,180 --> 02:21:31,020
and they're just like, yeah, man, I got an idea.

2868
02:21:31,760 --> 02:21:38,159
Let's put a fruit punch and like Kahlua in these

2869
02:21:38,159 --> 02:21:39,680
and freeze, that'll be fucking awesome

2870
02:21:39,680 --> 02:21:40,719
in like a few hours, dude.

2871
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:47,520
Revolutionary ice cube tube.

2872
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:49,520
That's 100% spill proof.

2873
02:21:49,520 --> 02:21:50,559
Watch how easy.

2874
02:21:50,559 --> 02:21:51,600
Just fill the flexible.

2875
02:21:51,600 --> 02:21:52,879
That's not enough ice.

2876
02:21:52,879 --> 02:21:55,520
Slide in the ice cube insert and freeze.

2877
02:21:55,520 --> 02:21:56,719
Wow, what a breeze.

2878
02:21:56,719 --> 02:21:57,600
How many cubes is that?

2879
02:21:57,600 --> 02:22:01,120
Now look, just pop and the cubes drop directly into the cup.

2880
02:22:01,120 --> 02:22:02,000
It's that easy.

2881
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:02,479
Not enough.

2882
02:22:02,479 --> 02:22:03,520
Grab that with a regular tray.

2883
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:04,000
It was bigger.

2884
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,719
Go ahead, pop and drop into any size glass.

2885
02:22:06,719 --> 02:22:08,639
Quickly prepare ice coffee for work

2886
02:22:08,639 --> 02:22:11,920
or create refreshing drinks without ever making a mess.

2887
02:22:11,920 --> 02:22:14,719
No spare chills, advanced interlocking technology.

2888
02:22:14,719 --> 02:22:16,239
That's really easy to fill up, though.

2889
02:22:16,239 --> 02:22:17,120
That's very easy.

2890
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:18,959
Even over this expensive computer.

2891
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:21,200
No, amazing.

2892
02:22:21,200 --> 02:22:21,840
The secret.

2893
02:22:21,840 --> 02:22:22,799
No spill chills.

2894
02:22:22,799 --> 02:22:26,639
Flexible sleeve and expensive computer inside.

2895
02:22:26,639 --> 02:22:27,440
So they always.

2896
02:22:27,440 --> 02:22:28,959
How expensive is this computer?

2897
02:22:28,959 --> 02:22:30,000
Divided insert.

2898
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:31,680
Secure the cubes inside.

2899
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:33,440
So not a single.

2900
02:22:33,440 --> 02:22:36,479
Oh, this expensive JPEG of a computer.

2901
02:22:36,479 --> 02:22:36,959
I see.

2902
02:22:36,959 --> 02:22:38,319
Drop amazing.

2903
02:22:38,319 --> 02:22:38,959
The secret.

2904
02:22:38,959 --> 02:22:39,920
No spill chills.

2905
02:22:39,920 --> 02:22:43,280
Flexible sleeve and divided insert that secure the cubes.

2906
02:22:43,280 --> 02:22:48,079
If this was two, if this was a double and it was a little longer,

2907
02:22:48,079 --> 02:22:49,600
I'd probably be into it.

2908
02:22:49,600 --> 02:22:50,719
I guess maybe you get a bunch.

2909
02:22:50,719 --> 02:22:52,719
Flat, vertical, upside down.

2910
02:22:52,719 --> 02:22:54,399
Anywhere in your freezer.

2911
02:22:54,399 --> 02:22:56,639
They're even fitted to stack and store.

2912
02:22:56,639 --> 02:22:58,239
Perfect for home, office.

2913
02:22:58,239 --> 02:23:02,000
Yeah, I mean like a small fridge.

2914
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,399
We all love homemade soups and sauces,

2915
02:23:04,399 --> 02:23:07,680
but who wants to stand in front of the stove for hours stirring?

2916
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:11,280
And if you happen to step away, you can end up burning your food.

2917
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:12,239
For one second.

2918
02:23:16,799 --> 02:23:17,120
What?

2919
02:23:30,639 --> 02:23:31,600
This is ridiculous.

2920
02:23:36,799 --> 02:23:38,000
That's not really stirring.

2921
02:23:38,799 --> 02:23:40,000
It's kind of just moving around.

2922
02:23:41,440 --> 02:23:45,520
It's battery operated and so sturdy it can stir for up to four hours

2923
02:23:45,520 --> 02:23:48,399
and stand heat up to five hundred and seventy two degrees.

2924
02:23:48,399 --> 02:23:51,680
Four hours on your back on your food and it won't burn.

2925
02:23:51,680 --> 02:23:55,600
Robuster is great for gravy soup for soups and stews and for beans.

2926
02:23:55,600 --> 02:23:58,159
It's the best mixed marinara masala.

2927
02:23:58,159 --> 02:24:01,600
It even has the straight fold alfredo and turn your cheese sauce.

2928
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:06,879
The secrets, the orbital gyroscopic action that ensures no spot is unstirred or untouched.

2929
02:24:06,879 --> 02:24:10,719
From underneath, you can see how the Robuster keeps everything moving.

2930
02:24:11,680 --> 02:24:14,079
So I don't even say with the Robuster,

2931
02:24:14,079 --> 02:24:18,559
you finally have that third hand in the kitchen so you can get two things done at once.

2932
02:24:18,559 --> 02:24:20,319
Cleanups easy and it's dish.

2933
02:24:20,319 --> 02:24:20,879
I don't know.

2934
02:24:20,879 --> 02:24:24,559
I don't even say it stirs so you don't have to.

2935
02:24:25,280 --> 02:24:30,559
I mean, it's just I guess it's like solves some kind of issue.

2936
02:24:33,309 --> 02:24:34,829
But I mean, how many pans do you have out?

2937
02:24:34,829 --> 02:24:35,469
Like, what do you do?

2938
02:24:35,469 --> 02:24:36,430
How much food are you making?

2939
02:24:36,430 --> 02:24:40,829
I'm making a lot of different things.

2940
02:24:40,829 --> 02:24:42,829
All right, we got the Shogun steamer.

2941
02:24:43,790 --> 02:24:47,010
This is the urn that they just repurpose it.

2942
02:24:47,010 --> 02:24:48,500
We already see this.

2943
02:24:49,219 --> 02:24:53,780
Now you can enjoy all the flavors and healthy benefits of ancient cooking secrets

2944
02:24:53,780 --> 02:24:55,940
right from your microwave in just minutes.

2945
02:24:55,940 --> 02:24:58,420
It's the same fucking product.

2946
02:24:58,420 --> 02:25:02,100
It's the modern version of this timeless classic and it cooks meat,

2947
02:25:02,100 --> 02:25:06,659
fish and vegetables, even frozen foods faster and better than a dozen pots and pans.

2948
02:25:06,659 --> 02:25:08,260
Is the impossible.

2949
02:25:08,260 --> 02:25:12,340
Watch on the left boiling water on the right, the Shogun steamer.

2950
02:25:12,340 --> 02:25:14,100
We place fresh veggies in both.

2951
02:25:14,100 --> 02:25:16,899
And a few minutes later, the vegetables are soggy.

2952
02:25:16,899 --> 02:25:19,379
But the Shogun steamer done perfectly.

2953
02:25:19,379 --> 02:25:22,180
Vitamins and color don't have a chance to boil away.

2954
02:25:22,180 --> 02:25:24,260
These fish fillets are frozen solid.

2955
02:25:24,260 --> 02:25:26,739
One goes in the oven, the other in the steamer.

2956
02:25:26,739 --> 02:25:29,299
Minutes later, the oven fish is cold as a pot.

2957
02:25:29,299 --> 02:25:30,180
Minutes later.

2958
02:25:30,180 --> 02:25:32,180
The steamer fillet is done to perfection.

2959
02:25:32,180 --> 02:25:36,299
Minutes later, did you stop it before it was done?

2960
02:25:36,299 --> 02:25:40,610
You can't put the same rules on two different cooking appliances.

2961
02:25:40,610 --> 02:25:43,889
Hey, look, we put this frozen salmon in the oven for three minutes

2962
02:25:43,889 --> 02:25:47,409
and we put this frozen salmon in this in the Shogun streamer for three minutes.

2963
02:25:47,409 --> 02:25:50,540
And look at the difference.

2964
02:25:50,540 --> 02:25:53,500
You can't apply the same rules to different appliances.

2965
02:25:53,500 --> 02:25:55,069
Is that what they're implying?

2966
02:25:55,069 --> 02:25:56,719
No, it can't be right.

2967
02:25:56,719 --> 02:25:58,000
Are frozen solid.

2968
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,479
One goes in the oven, the other in the steamer.

2969
02:26:00,479 --> 02:26:03,520
Minutes later, the oven fish is cold as a popsicle.

2970
02:26:03,520 --> 02:26:05,920
But the steamer fillet is done to perfection.

2971
02:26:05,920 --> 02:26:09,920
Simply add water, then choose the larger small basket depending on your meal.

2972
02:26:09,920 --> 02:26:11,920
Then pop it in the microwave and press.

2973
02:26:11,920 --> 02:26:14,319
And the Shogun steamer does the rest.

2974
02:26:14,319 --> 02:26:15,200
Is it magic?

2975
02:26:15,200 --> 02:26:16,479
No, it's science.

2976
02:26:16,479 --> 02:26:17,440
You see boiling.

2977
02:26:17,440 --> 02:26:18,000
No, it's.

2978
02:26:19,840 --> 02:26:21,360
All right, listen to the audio stop.

2979
02:26:21,360 --> 02:26:23,040
Listen to the audio splice.

2980
02:26:23,040 --> 02:26:23,920
Is it magic?

2981
02:26:23,920 --> 02:26:26,479
No, no.

2982
02:26:27,860 --> 02:26:28,739
Is it magic?

2983
02:26:28,739 --> 02:26:32,030
No, it's the steam technology.

2984
02:26:32,030 --> 02:26:32,829
Is it magic?

2985
02:26:32,829 --> 02:26:34,110
No, listen to this.

2986
02:26:34,110 --> 02:26:34,829
The rest.

2987
02:26:34,829 --> 02:26:35,709
Is it magic?

2988
02:26:35,709 --> 02:26:36,270
No, it's.

2989
02:26:38,860 --> 02:26:41,979
No, is it magic?

2990
02:26:41,979 --> 02:26:43,899
No, steamer does the rest.

2991
02:26:43,899 --> 02:26:44,780
Is it magic?

2992
02:26:44,780 --> 02:26:46,059
No, it's science.

2993
02:26:46,059 --> 02:26:47,579
You see boiling water is hot.

2994
02:26:47,579 --> 02:26:48,219
What was wrong there?

2995
02:26:48,219 --> 02:26:49,979
Steam is hotter, so it cooks faster.

2996
02:26:50,219 --> 02:26:51,100
Why did they need a dubter?

2997
02:26:51,100 --> 02:26:52,379
It washes away vitamins and flavor.

2998
02:26:52,379 --> 02:26:53,819
Steaming locks them in.

2999
02:26:53,819 --> 02:26:56,860
So your meals taste twice as good in half the time.

3000
02:26:56,860 --> 02:26:59,819
And the twist and drain feature lets you save the broth.

3001
02:26:59,819 --> 02:27:02,620
And it makes perfect pasta every time.

3002
02:27:02,620 --> 02:27:04,540
Enjoy a delicious seafood feast.

3003
02:27:04,540 --> 02:27:05,100
It's the same.

3004
02:27:05,100 --> 02:27:05,500
We saw it.

3005
02:27:05,500 --> 02:27:06,700
We see a lot already with the thing.

3006
02:27:06,700 --> 02:27:07,659
Perfectly done rice and potatoes.

3007
02:27:07,659 --> 02:27:08,860
With the drain at the bottom.

3008
02:27:08,860 --> 02:27:11,579
The Shogun steamer replaces a cabinet full of pots and pans.

3009
02:27:11,579 --> 02:27:13,659
And it's just $19.95.

3010
02:27:13,659 --> 02:27:16,940
Plus, you get our Shogun 10-Minute Meals Cookbook.

3011
02:27:16,940 --> 02:27:18,780
Packed with easy and healthy meals.

3012
02:27:18,860 --> 02:27:20,059
And as if that weren't enough...

3013
02:27:20,059 --> 02:27:27,100
Yeah, all they did was change the name to the Shogun steamer.

3014
02:27:30,590 --> 02:27:33,069
They added like a gong in the commercial.

3015
02:27:33,069 --> 02:27:36,750
That's the only difference between the two commercials.

3016
02:27:39,090 --> 02:27:40,209
What was the point of that?

3017
02:27:40,209 --> 02:27:42,049
Two steamers and two cookbooks.

3018
02:27:42,049 --> 02:27:43,809
Just basic processing and handling.

3019
02:27:43,809 --> 02:27:46,129
You must agree it's the most time-saving,

3020
02:27:46,129 --> 02:27:48,530
flavor-sealing cooking tool you've ever used

3021
02:27:48,530 --> 02:27:50,450
or return it for a full refund.

3022
02:27:50,450 --> 02:27:53,329
But keep as a free gift our handy cut-and-cut chopper.

3023
02:27:54,049 --> 02:27:54,930
These are ridiculous.

3024
02:27:54,930 --> 02:27:55,569
These are so...

3025
02:27:55,569 --> 02:27:57,860
I love this.

3026
02:27:57,860 --> 02:27:59,860
Okay, how about the Miracle Grill Mat?

3027
02:27:59,860 --> 02:28:03,649
Do you love to grill but hate the messy cleanup?

3028
02:28:03,649 --> 02:28:04,610
All right, we got Mark Gill here.

3029
02:28:04,610 --> 02:28:06,690
First of all, it gets one full letter grade.

3030
02:28:07,409 --> 02:28:09,729
Do you love to grill but hate the messy cleanup?

3031
02:28:09,729 --> 02:28:10,450
Me too!

3032
02:28:10,450 --> 02:28:12,930
Hi, Mark Gill here for the Miracle Grill Mat.

3033
02:28:12,930 --> 02:28:13,649
It takes any grill...

3034
02:28:13,649 --> 02:28:14,450
These green screens somewhere.

3035
02:28:14,450 --> 02:28:16,450
...and makes it completely non-stick.

3036
02:28:16,450 --> 02:28:16,770
And...

3037
02:28:16,770 --> 02:28:17,250
Where is he?

3038
02:28:17,250 --> 02:28:18,370
...it eliminates cleanup.

3039
02:28:18,370 --> 02:28:20,290
Here's something you could never do at home.

3040
02:28:20,290 --> 02:28:22,770
I'm gonna do breakfast on my barbecue.

3041
02:28:22,770 --> 02:28:23,329
I'm even gonna add...

3042
02:28:23,329 --> 02:28:24,049
Oh, it's like a mat?

3043
02:28:24,049 --> 02:28:24,770
...an egg.

3044
02:28:24,770 --> 02:28:25,729
Look at that.

3045
02:28:25,729 --> 02:28:28,049
And for a special treat, in just a second,

3046
02:28:28,049 --> 02:28:29,889
a little bit of shredded cheese.

3047
02:28:29,889 --> 02:28:31,809
I've even got my crispy bacon,

3048
02:28:31,809 --> 02:28:33,409
my savory hash browns.

3049
02:28:33,409 --> 02:28:34,770
If you come to the other side,

3050
02:28:34,770 --> 02:28:35,889
I have french toast,

3051
02:28:35,889 --> 02:28:36,530
sausage,

3052
02:28:36,530 --> 02:28:37,569
wonderful ham,

3053
02:28:37,569 --> 02:28:38,530
tangy pineapple,

3054
02:28:38,530 --> 02:28:39,090
and toast.

3055
02:28:39,090 --> 02:28:40,930
A whole breakfast for the entire family!

3056
02:28:40,930 --> 02:28:41,250
Stop!

3057
02:28:41,250 --> 02:28:42,129
On my barbecue!

3058
02:28:42,129 --> 02:28:42,610
By the way...

3059
02:28:43,649 --> 02:28:46,209
I don't know if anybody's household was like this or not,

3060
02:28:46,209 --> 02:28:47,620
but like...

3061
02:28:47,620 --> 02:28:50,879
I'm sorry, my like mother or father

3062
02:28:50,879 --> 02:28:53,920
is not going to make like separate fucking breakfasts

3063
02:28:53,920 --> 02:28:55,520
for six different people.

3064
02:28:56,930 --> 02:28:59,250
Oh, you got your ham and pineapple for Jerry.

3065
02:28:59,250 --> 02:29:01,170
You've got your cheese quesadilla

3066
02:29:01,170 --> 02:29:04,770
and eggs over here for Sally.

3067
02:29:04,770 --> 02:29:06,049
Oh, and then you got your french toast.

3068
02:29:06,049 --> 02:29:07,729
Like, who the fuck is doing that?

3069
02:29:07,729 --> 02:29:08,850
My mother's gonna...

3070
02:29:08,850 --> 02:29:12,459
My mother's making like scrambled eggs, bacon, and toast.

3071
02:29:12,459 --> 02:29:13,420
I'm not being like,

3072
02:29:13,420 --> 02:29:17,020
Mom, can I have pineapple and ham instead?

3073
02:29:17,020 --> 02:29:17,260
Why?

3074
02:29:17,260 --> 02:29:19,180
They always show making like eight breakfasts

3075
02:29:19,180 --> 02:29:22,399
for eight different people.

3076
02:29:22,399 --> 02:29:23,280
No, you're just gonna be...

3077
02:29:23,280 --> 02:29:25,840
You're gonna get what mom or dad makes.

3078
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:27,170
That's not how this works.

3079
02:29:27,170 --> 02:29:28,690
They're probably on my barbecue!

3080
02:29:29,649 --> 02:29:31,139
Hey, you want non-stick?

3081
02:29:31,700 --> 02:29:33,540
Mom, I want a ham steak today with pineapple.

3082
02:29:33,540 --> 02:29:34,579
And I still got my grill lines.

3083
02:29:34,579 --> 02:29:34,819
Okay.

3084
02:29:34,819 --> 02:29:36,420
Now, remember that special treat?

3085
02:29:36,420 --> 02:29:38,579
Watch the egg right into the cheese.

3086
02:29:38,579 --> 02:29:39,780
I'm gonna grab my toast.

3087
02:29:40,420 --> 02:29:43,379
Toast, eggs, and cheese on my miracle grill mat,

3088
02:29:43,379 --> 02:29:45,860
and nothing sticks.

3089
02:29:45,860 --> 02:29:46,180
Whoa!

3090
02:29:46,180 --> 02:29:47,059
Are you kidding me?

3091
02:29:47,059 --> 02:29:48,420
Are you kidding me?

3092
02:29:48,420 --> 02:29:51,059
Delicious, and I never have to clean my...

3093
02:29:51,059 --> 02:29:52,180
Are you kidding me?

3094
02:29:52,180 --> 02:29:54,420
Ooey, gooey, delicious,

3095
02:29:54,420 --> 02:29:56,979
and I never have to clean my barbecue again.

3096
02:29:56,979 --> 02:29:57,620
Grill lines.

3097
02:29:58,579 --> 02:30:02,579
Everybody loves thick, juicy, restaurant-quality steak.

3098
02:30:02,579 --> 02:30:04,100
Restaurant-quality steak.

3099
02:30:04,100 --> 02:30:05,139
Restaurant-quality.

3100
02:30:05,139 --> 02:30:06,819
Restaurant-quality shrimp.

3101
02:30:06,819 --> 02:30:08,579
Restaurant-quality steak.

3102
02:30:08,579 --> 02:30:09,950
A steak is a steak.

3103
02:30:09,950 --> 02:30:10,670
Let's just...

3104
02:30:10,670 --> 02:30:12,639
We have to clear this up too.

3105
02:30:12,639 --> 02:30:16,260
If you go buy like a ribeye somewhere,

3106
02:30:16,260 --> 02:30:17,940
it's of the same...

3107
02:30:17,940 --> 02:30:20,290
It's a ribeye.

3108
02:30:20,290 --> 02:30:22,530
Restaurant-quality steak.

3109
02:30:22,530 --> 02:30:23,329
It's just a ribeye.

3110
02:30:23,329 --> 02:30:26,399
It's not like a special thing.

3111
02:30:26,399 --> 02:30:28,829
It's just a ribeye.

3112
02:30:28,829 --> 02:30:31,469
Onions and mushrooms right beside my steak.

3113
02:30:32,110 --> 02:30:32,670
How's that wrong?

3114
02:30:32,670 --> 02:30:33,629
Wait a minute for a second.

3115
02:30:33,629 --> 02:30:35,469
Grilled vegetables are amazing,

3116
02:30:35,469 --> 02:30:38,510
but trying to do them on an open grate is almost impossible.

3117
02:30:38,510 --> 02:30:39,629
Oh no, Mark.

3118
02:30:39,629 --> 02:30:40,510
They'll just fall through.

3119
02:30:40,510 --> 02:30:41,950
You'll need half your meal.

3120
02:30:41,950 --> 02:30:42,909
Have a look at this.

3121
02:30:42,909 --> 02:30:46,030
With the miracle grill mat, everything stays in place.

3122
02:30:46,030 --> 02:30:48,750
I can grill my vegetables right beside my meat.

3123
02:30:48,750 --> 02:30:50,030
I never lose a bite of food.

3124
02:30:50,030 --> 02:30:50,270
And here's the best part.

3125
02:30:50,270 --> 02:30:51,149
I can see this for like...

3126
02:30:51,149 --> 02:30:52,190
I never lose that great barbecue flavor.

3127
02:30:52,190 --> 02:30:53,870
Yeah, vegetables and fish and stuff.

3128
02:30:53,870 --> 02:30:54,510
That makes sense.

3129
02:30:54,510 --> 02:30:56,989
Flare-ups can ruin your meat and your hair.

3130
02:30:56,989 --> 02:30:57,149
What?

3131
02:30:57,149 --> 02:30:58,430
So with the miracle grill mat,

3132
02:30:58,430 --> 02:30:59,790
there's never any flare-ups.

3133
02:30:59,790 --> 02:31:02,909
And burnt-on sauces and marinades make for a cleaning nightmare.

3134
02:31:02,909 --> 02:31:04,110
But check this out.

3135
02:31:04,110 --> 02:31:07,309
With the miracle grill mat, clean up is a snap.

3136
02:31:08,989 --> 02:31:11,149
If you've ever tried to grill fish, you know.

3137
02:31:11,149 --> 02:31:12,909
It just flakes and falls apart.

3138
02:31:12,909 --> 02:31:17,790
But with the miracle grill mat, you get perfect fish every time.

3139
02:31:17,790 --> 02:31:20,670
You've seen just some of what the miracle grill mat can do.

3140
02:31:20,670 --> 02:31:22,989
Now get your very own miracle grill mat.

3141
02:31:22,989 --> 02:31:24,190
There's applications for it.

3142
02:31:24,190 --> 02:31:25,950
I mean, you can just use tin foil, right?

3143
02:31:25,950 --> 02:31:26,190
Yeah.

3144
02:31:31,469 --> 02:31:33,629
Yeah, and then just throw the tin foil away.

3145
02:31:33,629 --> 02:31:36,590
You have to like clean this thing.

3146
02:31:38,379 --> 02:31:41,340
That's true.

3147
02:31:41,340 --> 02:31:41,739
All right.

3148
02:31:41,739 --> 02:31:43,020
Fresh toppers.

3149
02:31:43,020 --> 02:31:51,469
No matter what containers you buy, you end up with this, this, or this.

3150
02:31:51,469 --> 02:31:52,510
Not anymore.

3151
02:31:52,510 --> 02:31:53,149
What?

3152
02:31:53,149 --> 02:31:56,670
Introducing the fresh toppers, the ingenious new food saver.

3153
02:31:56,670 --> 02:32:00,590
Fresh toppers pops right on your food to instantly seal in freshness.

3154
02:32:00,590 --> 02:32:04,909
Wait, you put it on top of an orange?

3155
02:32:04,909 --> 02:32:07,389
The one on the left was stored in a plastic container.

3156
02:32:07,389 --> 02:32:10,510
The one on the right, it's open to the air, isn't it?

3157
02:32:10,670 --> 02:32:11,389
Plastic wrap?

3158
02:32:11,389 --> 02:32:12,989
That's a storage trap.

3159
02:32:12,989 --> 02:32:14,190
Just fresh top them.

3160
02:32:14,190 --> 02:32:17,709
Fresh toppers form a protective seal like your food's natural skin.

3161
02:32:17,709 --> 02:32:19,469
Top on any fruit or vegetable.

3162
02:32:19,469 --> 02:32:20,909
Top on cans and jars.

3163
02:32:20,909 --> 02:32:21,950
Top on to seal on air.

3164
02:32:21,950 --> 02:32:22,590
Okay, jars.

3165
02:32:22,590 --> 02:32:24,750
I can see jars and jars make sense.

3166
02:32:24,750 --> 02:32:25,709
Fresh toppers keep odors in.

3167
02:32:25,709 --> 02:32:27,149
They're FDA approved.

3168
02:32:27,149 --> 02:32:27,870
Yummy.

3169
02:32:27,870 --> 02:32:31,629
Dishwashers safe and so easy to store in a shelf or in a drawer.

3170
02:32:31,629 --> 02:32:31,709
Cans.

3171
02:32:31,709 --> 02:32:33,469
What container can say that?

3172
02:32:33,469 --> 02:32:36,909
Now it's easy to top fruits and vegetables with fresh toppers.

3173
02:32:36,909 --> 02:32:38,590
I love my fresh toppers.

3174
02:32:38,590 --> 02:32:39,790
Why do I feel like this would be kind of hard to get off?

3175
02:32:40,750 --> 02:32:43,549
I feel like I'd have to like peel.

3176
02:32:43,549 --> 02:32:45,469
I feel like I'd be paying the ass to get off on some stuff.

3177
02:32:46,909 --> 02:32:48,030
Why they keep smelling?

3178
02:32:48,030 --> 02:32:48,909
Stop sniffing it.

3179
02:32:51,069 --> 02:32:51,629
That's weird.

3180
02:32:51,629 --> 02:32:52,190
I don't like that.

3181
02:32:52,190 --> 02:32:54,430
Money and keep your food fresher longer.

3182
02:32:54,430 --> 02:32:56,590
Call and order fresh toppers today for only $10.

3183
02:32:57,229 --> 02:32:58,190
How many do you get though?

3184
02:32:58,989 --> 02:33:01,950
Because if you only get like four, you get four.

3185
02:33:05,139 --> 02:33:12,129
Okay, let's preserve one half tomato and like a lime.

3186
02:33:12,129 --> 02:33:15,250
That's not enough.

3187
02:33:16,209 --> 02:33:18,049
Colors tomato, red, carrot, orange.

3188
02:33:18,049 --> 02:33:18,770
It's going to be double.

3189
02:33:18,770 --> 02:33:19,809
It's going to be green.

3190
02:33:19,809 --> 02:33:20,850
But wait, there's more.

3191
02:33:20,850 --> 02:33:24,370
Can be a call now and we'll include this three piece stainless steel knife set.

3192
02:33:24,370 --> 02:33:25,409
Exactly what I told you before.

3193
02:33:26,450 --> 02:33:28,129
Precisely what we talked about.

3194
02:33:28,129 --> 02:33:28,690
Precisely.

3195
02:33:30,930 --> 02:33:32,290
This is a different product.

3196
02:33:32,290 --> 02:33:35,889
This is a knife set that this is also now what you have now too.

3197
02:33:37,309 --> 02:33:38,829
It's completely different product.

3198
02:33:38,829 --> 02:33:40,430
Perfect for cutting any produce.

3199
02:33:40,430 --> 02:33:42,030
A $25 value.

3200
02:33:42,030 --> 02:33:44,590
Just pay separate processing, but that's not all.

3201
02:33:44,590 --> 02:33:46,510
Order now and we'll double your order.

3202
02:33:47,469 --> 02:33:49,069
And more knives.

3203
02:33:49,069 --> 02:33:51,149
Two tomato, red, two carrot, orange.

3204
02:33:51,149 --> 02:33:52,350
We've got to get rid of some inventory.

3205
02:33:52,350 --> 02:33:55,469
Two pepper green and two three piece knife sets.

3206
02:33:55,469 --> 02:33:57,389
All for only $10.

3207
02:33:57,389 --> 02:33:59,790
This offer is not available in stores.

3208
02:33:59,790 --> 02:34:00,590
Don't wait.

3209
02:34:00,590 --> 02:34:03,790
Okay, I still feel like this kind of odd weird number of stuff.

3210
02:34:06,899 --> 02:34:10,739
All right, we're probably going to move away from kitchen appliances.

3211
02:34:10,739 --> 02:34:11,780
I got this tons to go through.

3212
02:34:11,780 --> 02:34:13,250
Don't worry.

3213
02:34:13,250 --> 02:34:15,170
But there's other stuff too.

3214
02:34:15,170 --> 02:34:19,040
There's other products that are not just in the kitchen.

3215
02:34:19,040 --> 02:34:20,799
Big Boss Sliceroo.

3216
02:34:20,879 --> 02:34:29,569
Are you tired of spending all your time slicing and dicing and shredding and chopping?

3217
02:34:29,569 --> 02:34:33,569
Tired of those other so-called slicers that can be dangerous?

3218
02:34:33,569 --> 02:34:35,969
Well, say goodbye to all of that.

3219
02:34:35,969 --> 02:34:38,290
Introducing Sliceroo.

3220
02:34:38,290 --> 02:34:43,090
In seconds, you can slice onions, apples, potatoes, and cucumbers.

3221
02:34:43,090 --> 02:34:44,530
Shred cabbage, carrots, and beans.

3222
02:34:44,530 --> 02:34:45,569
They're fighting each other now.

3223
02:34:45,569 --> 02:34:47,729
And curl zucchini, squash, potato.

3224
02:34:47,729 --> 02:34:48,690
They're fighting each other now.

3225
02:34:48,690 --> 02:34:52,129
Turn your meal time into fun time with the Sliceroo.

3226
02:34:52,610 --> 02:34:54,610
This is not the vej-ju...

3227
02:34:55,649 --> 02:34:56,290
Wait a minute.

3228
02:34:58,260 --> 02:34:59,299
Wait a minute.

3229
02:34:59,299 --> 02:35:10,670
This is the vej-ju-roo?

3230
02:35:13,090 --> 02:35:14,370
No, it's the vegetti.

3231
02:35:16,129 --> 02:35:17,729
I thought this was the vej-ju-roo.

3232
02:35:24,299 --> 02:35:24,620
Okay.

3233
02:35:24,620 --> 02:35:25,739
Well, we already know that one.

3234
02:35:25,739 --> 02:35:27,180
We don't need to see that one again.

3235
02:35:27,180 --> 02:35:31,059
The Big Boss Sliceroo.

3236
02:35:31,059 --> 02:35:32,739
All right, the Stone Wave.

3237
02:35:32,739 --> 02:35:34,979
Hi, Mark Gill here.

3238
02:35:34,979 --> 02:35:35,459
There he is.

3239
02:35:35,459 --> 02:35:36,260
The Stone Wave.

3240
02:35:36,260 --> 02:35:40,819
The new ceramic cooker with the steam-released chimney that makes dishes so delicious

3241
02:35:40,819 --> 02:35:42,739
you'll crave cooking in the Wave.

3242
02:35:42,899 --> 02:35:45,139
Poached eggs are such a pain to make.

3243
02:35:45,139 --> 02:35:45,860
They are, but...

3244
02:35:45,860 --> 02:35:47,379
Put an egg into Stone Wave.

3245
02:35:47,379 --> 02:35:49,620
No need for butter, fats, or oil.

3246
02:35:49,620 --> 02:35:51,780
Just pop it in the microwave for one minute.

3247
02:35:51,780 --> 02:35:55,250
Eddly smooth, velvety poached egg.

3248
02:35:55,250 --> 02:35:56,209
Stone Wave is non-stick.

3249
02:35:56,209 --> 02:35:56,690
Is it po...

3250
02:35:56,690 --> 02:35:57,889
That's a poached egg.

3251
02:35:57,889 --> 02:35:58,690
The legs just fly right off.

3252
02:35:58,690 --> 02:36:02,290
Let's just add your favorite ingredient and cook.

3253
02:36:02,290 --> 02:36:04,530
The hollow handle stays cool enough to hold.

3254
02:36:04,530 --> 02:36:06,209
Look how fluffy that is.

3255
02:36:06,209 --> 02:36:07,889
Eat it right out of the Stone Wave.

3256
02:36:07,889 --> 02:36:09,569
No pans and no dishes.

3257
02:36:11,409 --> 02:36:14,450
The secret is the unique chimney releasing just the right amount

3258
02:36:14,450 --> 02:36:15,090
of steam.

3259
02:36:15,090 --> 02:36:17,090
The domed lid recirculates heat.

3260
02:36:17,090 --> 02:36:18,850
Cooking food to perfection.

3261
02:36:18,850 --> 02:36:20,610
Look, it recirculates heat.

3262
02:36:22,370 --> 02:36:24,209
Why does it always look like they don't like it?

3263
02:36:27,309 --> 02:36:31,329
Those eyes tell me, like, not very good.

3264
02:36:31,329 --> 02:36:34,450
The unique chimney releasing just the right amount of steam.

3265
02:36:34,450 --> 02:36:36,850
The domed lid recirculates heat.

3266
02:36:36,850 --> 02:36:38,209
Watch out, it's going to blow up.

3267
02:36:39,500 --> 02:36:40,299
It's going to get too high.

3268
02:36:46,879 --> 02:36:48,719
All right, now that's application.

3269
02:36:49,600 --> 02:36:51,200
If you like apple pie, I see it.

3270
02:36:56,510 --> 02:36:57,870
Or like a s'more or something.

3271
02:37:02,770 --> 02:37:03,889
A little soup too?

3272
02:37:03,889 --> 02:37:04,530
Like a little...

3273
02:37:04,530 --> 02:37:05,329
Okay, hold on.

3274
02:37:07,819 --> 02:37:08,299
How do you do that?

3275
02:37:10,590 --> 02:37:11,469
How did you do that?

3276
02:37:11,469 --> 02:37:12,510
How do you do that?

3277
02:37:12,510 --> 02:37:13,229
How did he do that?

3278
02:37:19,149 --> 02:37:19,790
How did you do that?

3279
02:37:25,629 --> 02:37:26,430
Recipe book.

3280
02:37:26,430 --> 02:37:29,790
You get the amazing ceramic stone wave and recipe book.

3281
02:37:29,790 --> 02:37:30,430
It's going to get cut off.

3282
02:37:32,350 --> 02:37:32,829
Mr. T?

3283
02:37:37,309 --> 02:37:38,030
Are we going to get another...

3284
02:37:38,590 --> 02:37:40,989
and cooking and cleaning up the mess.

3285
02:37:40,989 --> 02:37:43,389
Well, I challenged some friends of mine

3286
02:37:43,389 --> 02:37:45,309
to come up with a cooking invention

3287
02:37:45,309 --> 02:37:47,549
that would make it super easy for me

3288
02:37:47,549 --> 02:37:49,389
to whip up a tasty meal

3289
02:37:49,389 --> 02:37:52,590
quick enough to hit off a big fierce appetite.

3290
02:37:53,229 --> 02:37:55,549
Another like celebrity cooking thing?

3291
02:37:57,309 --> 02:37:57,790
What is it?

3292
02:38:02,079 --> 02:38:02,399
Whoa!

3293
02:38:09,100 --> 02:38:11,500
The flavor wave turbo is not a microwave,

3294
02:38:11,500 --> 02:38:12,700
but an amazing invention

3295
02:38:12,700 --> 02:38:14,299
that combines three types of cooking

3296
02:38:14,299 --> 02:38:16,219
to turbo cook all your favorite foods

3297
02:38:16,219 --> 02:38:19,020
up to three times faster with no added fat.

3298
02:38:19,020 --> 02:38:22,379
Mr. T is giving it a good effort here, I think.

3299
02:38:22,379 --> 02:38:23,500
...right from the freezer

3300
02:38:23,500 --> 02:38:24,940
and have it fully cooked for you

3301
02:38:24,940 --> 02:38:27,180
three times faster than an ordinary oven.

3302
02:38:27,180 --> 02:38:29,739
Plus, it eliminates 75% of the fat.

3303
02:38:29,739 --> 02:38:31,899
Imagine mouth-watering turkey in 20 minutes.

3304
02:38:31,899 --> 02:38:33,180
Eliminate all the fat?

3305
02:38:36,780 --> 02:38:37,979
Is this a food processor?

3306
02:38:38,940 --> 02:38:41,020
Now, whether your food is fresh or frozen,

3307
02:38:41,020 --> 02:38:43,579
you can bake, broil, roast, toast,

3308
02:38:43,579 --> 02:38:46,620
sear, brown, barbecue, reheat, and more.

3309
02:38:46,620 --> 02:38:47,899
Faster than ever before.

3310
02:38:47,899 --> 02:38:48,540
That's weird looking.

3311
02:38:48,540 --> 02:38:49,819
Best of all, when you're all done cooking,

3312
02:38:49,819 --> 02:38:50,620
guess what?

3313
02:38:50,620 --> 02:38:53,340
The flavor wave actually cleans up for you.

3314
02:38:53,340 --> 02:38:53,579
What?

3315
02:38:53,579 --> 02:38:56,379
The flavor wave turbo oven is life-changing

3316
02:38:56,379 --> 02:38:58,219
because I can throw dinner together

3317
02:38:58,219 --> 02:38:59,819
in a matter of minutes

3318
02:38:59,819 --> 02:39:01,340
straight from the freezer

3319
02:39:01,340 --> 02:39:03,739
right into the flavor wave turbo oven to cook.

3320
02:39:03,739 --> 02:39:04,700
I really like the fact

3321
02:39:04,700 --> 02:39:06,139
that the flavor wave turbo oven

3322
02:39:06,139 --> 02:39:07,819
defrosts frozen foods.

3323
02:39:07,899 --> 02:39:09,340
I could just put something...

3324
02:39:09,340 --> 02:39:10,299
It's an air fryer.

3325
02:39:10,299 --> 02:39:11,899
...from the freezer into the flavor...

3326
02:39:11,899 --> 02:39:13,979
Was this an air fryer before air fryers?

3327
02:39:13,979 --> 02:39:16,780
I don't use any fats or oils in the flavor wave turbo.

3328
02:39:16,780 --> 02:39:17,180
Don't ever.

3329
02:39:17,180 --> 02:39:18,219
And that's quite surprising

3330
02:39:18,219 --> 02:39:19,260
because you don't need them.

3331
02:39:19,260 --> 02:39:20,780
No, who needs, like, fucking flavor?

3332
02:39:21,659 --> 02:39:22,780
No, I don't use any marinades.

3333
02:39:22,780 --> 02:39:24,860
I don't use any fats, any oils, any butter.

3334
02:39:24,860 --> 02:39:26,059
I don't season the meat either.

3335
02:39:26,059 --> 02:39:29,500
I just put in a frozen chunk of chicken leg

3336
02:39:29,500 --> 02:39:31,020
and the machine just does the whole thing.

3337
02:39:31,020 --> 02:39:32,459
And I eat it and it's dry as fuck

3338
02:39:32,459 --> 02:39:33,889
and it has no flavor

3339
02:39:33,889 --> 02:39:35,090
and no fats and no oils.

3340
02:39:35,090 --> 02:39:36,690
And get all that out of here.

3341
02:39:36,690 --> 02:39:42,059
I want it to be like a dry ass chicken.

3342
02:39:42,059 --> 02:39:45,620
Wait, what's this end here?

3343
02:39:45,620 --> 02:39:46,500
This ending.

3344
02:39:46,500 --> 02:39:50,780
It just comes out wonderful.

3345
02:39:50,780 --> 02:39:51,579
The push and prep.

3346
02:39:52,459 --> 02:39:53,340
Oh, more cutting.

3347
02:39:53,340 --> 02:39:55,020
It's a pain in the ass.

3348
02:39:55,020 --> 02:39:57,100
Oh, you're gonna slice your fucking hand off.

3349
02:39:58,219 --> 02:39:59,100
It's just a spawn.

3350
02:39:59,100 --> 02:40:01,340
Push and prep, the new miracle cutting tool

3351
02:40:01,340 --> 02:40:04,620
that lets you chop, slice, dice, mince in seconds.

3352
02:40:04,620 --> 02:40:07,340
This tower of power is actually three cutting blades

3353
02:40:07,340 --> 02:40:09,739
in one compact stack designed to double the...

3354
02:40:09,739 --> 02:40:11,020
Oh, we're getting duplicates.

3355
02:40:11,420 --> 02:40:12,799
Watch, just click in the...

3356
02:40:12,799 --> 02:40:14,319
These things do work though.

3357
02:40:14,319 --> 02:40:15,520
It's that easy to...

3358
02:40:15,520 --> 02:40:18,239
They're just, I mean, there's a lot of them.

3359
02:40:18,239 --> 02:40:20,799
Look, the quarter blade to push and prep

3360
02:40:20,799 --> 02:40:22,299
and through potatoes...

3361
02:40:22,299 --> 02:40:23,659
Is it repost?

3362
02:40:23,659 --> 02:40:25,420
I mean, I think it's a different company.

3363
02:40:25,420 --> 02:40:27,739
...for zesty zucchini sticks, french fries,

3364
02:40:27,739 --> 02:40:29,180
or sweet potato fries.

3365
02:40:29,180 --> 02:40:31,899
Use the slicing blade to power through peppers.

3366
02:40:31,899 --> 02:40:33,819
I think most of these are early 2000s, mid 2000s.

3367
02:40:33,819 --> 02:40:36,299
Push and prep for the fastest veggies yet.

3368
02:40:36,299 --> 02:40:38,379
Slice even the toughest pineapple.

3369
02:40:38,379 --> 02:40:40,700
Slice and dice peppers, tomatoes and onions

3370
02:40:40,700 --> 02:40:42,219
for a spicy salsa.

3371
02:40:42,219 --> 02:40:43,260
With sure grip handle,

3372
02:40:43,260 --> 02:40:45,500
the stay sharp stainless steel blades even cut...

3373
02:40:45,500 --> 02:40:46,860
Yeah, we've seen this already.

3374
02:40:48,579 --> 02:40:50,340
The best pot pie maker.

3375
02:40:50,340 --> 02:40:50,979
Oh, yup.

3376
02:40:52,059 --> 02:40:52,459
Let's go.

3377
02:40:55,020 --> 02:40:56,059
Why is he on the phone?

3378
02:40:58,719 --> 02:41:00,639
Wait, why did he call in?

3379
02:41:00,639 --> 02:41:03,520
Why did Chef Tony call into the infomercial?

3380
02:41:03,520 --> 02:41:07,170
It's like, was it radio?

3381
02:41:07,170 --> 02:41:09,899
Was he like being interviewed on a radio station?

3382
02:41:09,899 --> 02:41:10,860
Why is he calling in?

3383
02:41:15,219 --> 02:41:19,149
Do you love delicious mouth-watering hot pot pie?

3384
02:41:19,149 --> 02:41:19,950
But he's here.

3385
02:41:19,950 --> 02:41:22,659
But store-bought pot pies have lots of potatoes

3386
02:41:22,659 --> 02:41:24,270
and fill as you may not want.

3387
02:41:24,270 --> 02:41:25,950
And where's that beef?

3388
02:41:25,950 --> 02:41:26,510
What beef?

3389
02:41:26,510 --> 02:41:28,030
Why, Chef Tony, for best pot pie...

3390
02:41:28,030 --> 02:41:28,670
He's calling...

3391
02:41:28,670 --> 02:41:29,469
...now you can enjoy...

3392
02:41:39,520 --> 02:41:44,530
He's calling from prison.

3393
02:41:46,379 --> 02:41:49,389
There's nothing better to make with holiday left

3394
02:41:49,389 --> 02:41:50,590
than my best pot pie.

3395
02:41:50,590 --> 02:41:51,790
He had to finish the commercial.

3396
02:41:51,790 --> 02:41:54,590
He's contractually obligated to finish the commercial.

3397
02:41:55,149 --> 02:41:58,350
Do you love delicious mouth-watering hot pot pie?

3398
02:41:58,350 --> 02:42:01,149
But store-bought pot pies have lots of potatoes.

3399
02:42:01,709 --> 02:42:03,309
Oh, that's not fair.

3400
02:42:03,309 --> 02:42:04,430
He seems like a really nice guy.

3401
02:42:04,430 --> 02:42:04,909
He really does.

3402
02:42:04,909 --> 02:42:15,819
But Chef Tony, just use the crust cover to package the homemade dough

3403
02:42:15,819 --> 02:42:17,020
to form the bottom.

3404
02:42:17,020 --> 02:42:18,059
Spoon in your favorite...

3405
02:42:18,059 --> 02:42:18,299
Why?

3406
02:42:18,299 --> 02:42:19,979
But that was so weird.

3407
02:42:19,979 --> 02:42:20,780
...veggies...

3408
02:42:20,780 --> 02:42:22,299
Why have a call-in segment?

3409
02:42:22,299 --> 02:42:23,020
What the fuck?

3410
02:42:23,899 --> 02:42:26,379
Now, just heat them up and eat them up.

3411
02:42:27,500 --> 02:42:29,260
The best pot pie.

3412
02:42:29,260 --> 02:42:31,340
Make best pot pie your way.

3413
02:42:31,340 --> 02:42:33,500
Skip the carrots, load up on the peas.

3414
02:42:33,500 --> 02:42:34,379
Skip the carrots?

3415
02:42:34,379 --> 02:42:35,659
What are you, crazy Tony?

3416
02:42:35,659 --> 02:42:38,219
...into delicious new meals

3417
02:42:38,219 --> 02:42:39,739
for the whole family.

3418
02:42:39,739 --> 02:42:42,379
Make an amazing quiche for Sunday brunch

3419
02:42:42,379 --> 02:42:44,059
filled with your favorites.

3420
02:42:44,059 --> 02:42:44,459
Ham, cheese...

3421
02:42:44,459 --> 02:42:45,420
Who skips the carrots?

3422
02:42:45,420 --> 02:42:45,979
...mushrooms...

3423
02:42:45,979 --> 02:42:46,700
...and a pot pie?

3424
02:42:46,700 --> 02:42:47,340
You're out of your mind.

3425
02:42:47,340 --> 02:42:48,540
...so easy.

3426
02:42:48,540 --> 02:42:49,260
That's the best part.

3427
02:42:49,260 --> 02:42:51,100
...make pot pie chili smothered in milk...

3428
02:42:51,100 --> 02:42:51,420
Okay.

3429
02:42:52,139 --> 02:42:54,059
...Greek spinach and pet pie

3430
02:42:54,059 --> 02:42:57,420
and my favorite pepperoni pizza pot pie.

3431
02:42:57,420 --> 02:43:00,299
My kids love making s'mores pies for dessert

3432
02:43:00,299 --> 02:43:02,219
or sweet fruit tarts for mom.

3433
02:43:03,340 --> 02:43:03,979
They always...

3434
02:43:06,290 --> 02:43:08,860
You gotta give them credit, right?

3435
02:43:08,860 --> 02:43:11,100
It can't just be a pot pie maker.

3436
02:43:11,100 --> 02:43:11,819
It has to be...

3437
02:43:11,819 --> 02:43:13,340
It has to make cakes.

3438
02:43:14,850 --> 02:43:17,090
It can't just be a thing that makes pot pies.

3439
02:43:17,090 --> 02:43:17,889
It has to...

3440
02:43:17,889 --> 02:43:20,319
Look, it can be a muffin maker, too.

3441
02:43:20,319 --> 02:43:20,799
It can be...

3442
02:43:22,020 --> 02:43:23,299
It can make a pizza.

3443
02:43:23,299 --> 02:43:25,229
Dude, it can make pizza.

3444
02:43:25,229 --> 02:43:26,829
No, it's a pot pie maker, man.

3445
02:43:26,829 --> 02:43:27,709
That's fine.

3446
02:43:27,709 --> 02:43:28,270
That's okay.

3447
02:43:29,899 --> 02:43:30,540
It doesn't have to be like...

3448
02:43:30,540 --> 02:43:31,500
Oh, no, no, look.

3449
02:43:31,500 --> 02:43:33,739
We can prove that it can make a bunch of other food.

3450
02:43:33,739 --> 02:43:35,250
It doesn't have to make a pizza.

3451
02:43:35,250 --> 02:43:35,569
It's just...

3452
02:43:35,569 --> 02:43:37,250
Best pot pie is oven safe and...

3453
02:43:37,250 --> 02:43:38,370
It can make pot pies

3454
02:43:38,370 --> 02:43:39,969
and like other pastry type things.

3455
02:43:39,969 --> 02:43:40,850
Doesn't have to be a pizza.

3456
02:43:40,850 --> 02:43:44,049
Please now get my meal size best pie set

3457
02:43:44,049 --> 02:43:45,809

02:43:45,809 --> 02:43:47,489
top and bottom crust cutters,

3459
02:43:47,489 --> 02:43:48,930
and recipe guides for only $10.

3460
02:43:48,930 --> 02:43:50,450
I hope there's a phone segment again.

3461
02:43:50,450 --> 02:43:50,690
Please.

3462
02:43:50,690 --> 02:43:51,809
For dipping and processing.

3463
02:43:51,809 --> 02:43:53,649
And to make sure everyone in your family

3464
02:43:53,649 --> 02:43:55,489
enjoys their own favorite fillings,

3465
02:43:55,489 --> 02:43:57,729
you'll get an additional double baking tray

3466
02:43:57,729 --> 02:43:59,329
and this great list of specials.

3467
02:43:59,329 --> 02:44:00,129
Come on.

3468
02:44:00,129 --> 02:44:01,729
Just pay separate processing.

3469
02:44:01,729 --> 02:44:04,850
That's a $40 value for one special low price.

3470
02:44:04,850 --> 02:44:06,530
And ask about my pop-up tray.

3471
02:44:06,530 --> 02:44:08,930
It makes getting your pot pies out a snap.

3472
02:44:08,930 --> 02:44:12,530
Call or go online to get your best pot pie right now.

3473
02:44:13,489 --> 02:44:15,090
No, it was just a weird segment.

3474
02:44:15,090 --> 02:44:17,649
There's nothing better to make with holiday leftovers

3475
02:44:17,649 --> 02:44:20,750
than my best watch.

3476
02:44:20,750 --> 02:44:22,209
I don't get it.

3477
02:44:23,329 --> 02:44:23,729
Get it.

3478
02:44:24,850 --> 02:44:27,790
Nothing better to make with holiday leftovers.

3479
02:44:27,790 --> 02:44:28,909
This is so interesting.

3480
02:44:28,909 --> 02:44:30,110
This is so interesting.

3481
02:44:32,159 --> 02:44:32,879
I love it.

3482
02:44:32,879 --> 02:44:34,479
It's so just odd.

3483
02:44:36,780 --> 02:44:38,059
Magic steam wave.

3484
02:44:38,059 --> 02:44:39,819
I think we've seen plenty of these.

3485
02:44:39,819 --> 02:44:40,940
Okay, we'll go down to...

3486
02:44:42,450 --> 02:44:43,409
We'll go down to 50.

3487
02:44:47,940 --> 02:44:51,139
Microwave ovens are quick when you want to reheat.

3488
02:44:51,139 --> 02:44:53,219
But they can make your meal dry.

3489
02:44:53,219 --> 02:44:54,819
Especially meat.

3490
02:44:54,819 --> 02:44:56,739
And that chicken is like rubber.

3491
02:44:56,739 --> 02:44:57,219
And no...

3492
02:44:57,219 --> 02:44:58,180
I'm telling you.

3493
02:44:58,180 --> 02:44:59,620
It's fun to edit these.

3494
02:44:59,620 --> 02:45:00,979
It's time to get the magic steam wave.

3495
02:45:00,979 --> 02:45:03,540
The brand new way to use your microwave.

3496
02:45:03,540 --> 02:45:05,059
Wait, we gotta analyze this.

3497
02:45:05,700 --> 02:45:07,059
Look at what's going on here.

3498
02:45:07,700 --> 02:45:09,379
Especially meat.

3499
02:45:09,379 --> 02:45:09,860
And...

3500
02:45:09,860 --> 02:45:11,780
Look at this lady, right?

3501
02:45:12,420 --> 02:45:13,540
There everyone is like...

3502
02:45:13,540 --> 02:45:14,579
This lady is like...

3503
02:45:14,579 --> 02:45:16,180
That chicken is like...

3504
02:45:16,180 --> 02:45:17,219
She's like, oh my god.

3505
02:45:17,219 --> 02:45:18,899
She look at how embarrassed she is.

3506
02:45:18,899 --> 02:45:21,809
That all this food was put in the microwave.

3507
02:45:21,809 --> 02:45:22,290
All of it.

3508
02:45:22,290 --> 02:45:23,090
Everything here.

3509
02:45:23,090 --> 02:45:28,129
This is like one, two, three, four, five, probably six cutlets.

3510
02:45:28,129 --> 02:45:31,040
A whole side dish.

3511
02:45:31,040 --> 02:45:32,479
And this is just like a...

3512
02:45:32,479 --> 02:45:35,420
Ooh, sorry.

3513
02:45:36,379 --> 02:45:38,299
I put everything in the microwave.

3514
02:45:38,299 --> 02:45:38,780
Everything.

3515
02:45:38,780 --> 02:45:40,219
No one will eat.

3516
02:45:40,219 --> 02:45:40,620
Oops.

3517
02:45:42,020 --> 02:45:43,700
It's time to get the magic steam wave.

3518
02:45:43,700 --> 02:45:44,819
You wouldn't put all of them.

3519
02:45:44,819 --> 02:45:47,219
The brand new way to use your microwave.

3520
02:45:47,780 --> 02:45:50,500
Magic steam wave uses the power of steam

3521
02:45:50,979 --> 02:45:52,739
Another microwave steamer.

3522
02:45:52,739 --> 02:45:53,940
These were so popular.

3523
02:45:53,940 --> 02:45:56,739
Heating food evenly and locking in moisture.

3524
02:45:56,739 --> 02:45:59,940
Your food tastes like it's fresh from the oven.

3525
02:45:59,940 --> 02:46:03,219
Look, this day old bread is already hard as a rock.

3526
02:46:03,940 --> 02:46:06,260
But 30 seconds in the magic steam wave...

3527
02:46:06,260 --> 02:46:07,139
Day old bread?

3528
02:46:07,940 --> 02:46:11,780
I've eaten like week or two old bread and it wasn't like that.

3529
02:46:11,780 --> 02:46:12,280
Huh?

3530
02:46:12,979 --> 02:46:15,700
Simply add a little water to the steam capsule.

3531
02:46:15,700 --> 02:46:17,379
Day old bread.

3532
02:46:17,379 --> 02:46:21,620
The new patent pending technology quickly creates and circulates steam.

3533
02:46:21,620 --> 02:46:25,540
Making your microwave work like an expensive convection oven.

3534
02:46:26,180 --> 02:46:30,819
You get moist, delicious gourmet meals in a microwave minute.

3535
02:46:30,819 --> 02:46:32,180
Perfect every time.

3536
02:46:32,180 --> 02:46:34,020
No sticky plastic wrap.

3537
02:46:34,020 --> 02:46:36,020
No wet paper towels.

3538
02:46:36,020 --> 02:46:40,579
With magic steam wave, you can steam all your fresh foods fast.

3539
02:46:40,579 --> 02:46:42,020
Everything cooks evenly.

3540
02:46:42,020 --> 02:46:43,219
The paper towel works just fine.

3541
02:46:43,219 --> 02:46:44,500
No spots for uncooked areas.

3542
02:46:44,500 --> 02:46:46,500
So call today and get the amazing...

3543
02:46:46,500 --> 02:46:48,100

02:46:50,020 --> 02:46:50,979

Order now and get the magic steam wave caddy free.

3547
02:46:54,260 --> 02:46:56,020
Here's the thing that it comes in.

3548
02:46:56,020 --> 02:46:57,940
It holds all your plates or bowls...

3549
02:46:57,940 --> 02:46:59,059
Here's the thing that it comes in.

3550
02:46:59,059 --> 02:47:02,579
...while allowing steam to circulate and cook your meal evenly.

3551
02:47:02,579 --> 02:47:05,700
And the handles are always cool to the touch.

3552
02:47:05,700 --> 02:47:07,059
Delicious.

3553
02:47:07,059 --> 02:47:08,020
Reheat.

3554
02:47:08,020 --> 02:47:08,739
Restore.

3555
02:47:08,739 --> 02:47:10,020
Okay, we don't need to say anymore.

3556
02:47:11,739 --> 02:47:13,100
The perfect bacon bowl.

3557
02:47:13,899 --> 02:47:15,100
This is a classic.

3558
02:47:15,100 --> 02:47:16,139
I think everybody's seen this.

3559
02:47:17,500 --> 02:47:18,540
Everybody's seen this, right?

3560
02:47:19,860 --> 02:47:21,540
This is the perfect bacon bowl.

3561
02:47:21,540 --> 02:47:22,979
I've seen it.

3562
02:47:22,979 --> 02:47:23,379
You have.

3563
02:47:23,379 --> 02:47:25,059
Everybody loves bacon.

3564
02:47:25,059 --> 02:47:26,020
The sizzle.

3565
02:47:26,020 --> 02:47:26,819
The scent.

3566
02:47:26,819 --> 02:47:28,420
The mouth-watering taste.

3567
02:47:28,420 --> 02:47:30,100
Didn't think it could get any better?

3568
02:47:30,100 --> 02:47:30,659
Watch.

3569
02:47:30,659 --> 02:47:32,579
We're turning bacon upside down.

3570
02:47:32,579 --> 02:47:33,139
It's a muffin tray.

3571
02:47:33,139 --> 02:47:35,059
Introducing bacon bowl.

3572
02:47:35,059 --> 02:47:36,819
The easy way to make delicious edible bowls...

3573
02:47:36,819 --> 02:47:37,780
It's an upside down muffin tray.

3574
02:47:37,780 --> 02:47:40,979
...have bacon for fun, savory, crunchable yum.

3575
02:47:40,979 --> 02:47:44,659
Just wrap your favorite cut of bacon around the bacon bowl form and cook.

3576
02:47:44,659 --> 02:47:45,620
And put it into the oven.

3577
02:47:45,620 --> 02:47:48,260
In just minutes, you'll have tasty, toasty bacon.

3578
02:47:48,579 --> 02:47:49,379
The big crunch.

3579
02:47:49,379 --> 02:47:51,059
...and hash browns for breakfast.

3580
02:47:51,059 --> 02:47:53,059
It's better in a bacon bowl.

3581
02:47:53,059 --> 02:47:54,739
BLT for lunch.

3582
02:47:54,739 --> 02:47:57,299
Bacon bowl makes a whole new way to munch.

3583
02:47:57,299 --> 02:47:59,139
The patented design allows the bacon...

3584
02:47:59,139 --> 02:47:59,700
I'd eat that.

3585
02:48:00,959 --> 02:48:01,920
Talk all the shit you want.

3586
02:48:01,920 --> 02:48:03,200
Everybody talk a bunch of shit.

3587
02:48:03,200 --> 02:48:06,270
You gotta talk a bunch of shit.

3588
02:48:06,270 --> 02:48:10,190
If you drizzled like mayo, mayo, mayo, mayo.

3589
02:48:10,190 --> 02:48:12,219
I'd eat this.

3590
02:48:12,219 --> 02:48:12,620
This would...

3591
02:48:12,620 --> 02:48:14,059
I would probably enjoy that.

3592
02:48:14,059 --> 02:48:18,690
That actually...

3593
02:48:18,690 --> 02:48:22,180
As long as the bacon was like cooked and it was actually crispy and good.

3594
02:48:22,180 --> 02:48:25,299
It'd be like drizzle, drizzle, drizzle, drizzle, drizzle.

3595
02:48:25,940 --> 02:48:26,819
Just a little bit of mayo.

3596
02:48:26,819 --> 02:48:28,100
Just a small line of mayo.

3597
02:48:28,659 --> 02:48:30,020
And I would eat it.

3598
02:48:30,659 --> 02:48:33,219
I wouldn't be excited.

3599
02:48:33,219 --> 02:48:34,260
But I would be like, that's good.

3600
02:48:34,260 --> 02:48:36,260
...while Grease collects in the channel.

3601
02:48:36,260 --> 02:48:38,500
So you can pour it out of your diet.

3602
02:48:38,500 --> 02:48:44,420
Go from unsatisfying bacon bit snacks to hot crispy bacon bowl stuff to the max.

3603
02:48:44,420 --> 02:48:46,100
Or make healthy egg white turkey bacon bowls.

3604
02:48:46,100 --> 02:48:47,459
He's a mayo addict.

3605
02:48:47,459 --> 02:48:48,260
I'm not a mayo.

3606
02:48:48,260 --> 02:48:49,059
Mayo is good.

3607
02:48:49,059 --> 02:48:49,299
Stop.

3608
02:48:49,299 --> 02:48:50,579
I'm itching my nose so much.

3609
02:48:50,579 --> 02:48:55,459
...bacon bowl cooks bacon to perfection in the oven, microwave, and toaster oven too.

3610
02:48:55,459 --> 02:48:56,899
Feel like mac and cheese?

3611
02:48:56,899 --> 02:48:57,459
Serve up the...

3612
02:48:58,180 --> 02:48:59,819
We're moving on.

3613
02:49:01,020 --> 02:49:01,340
All right.

3614
02:49:01,340 --> 02:49:03,020
We got the easy meatball.

3615
02:49:06,219 --> 02:49:07,100
Easy meatball.

3616
02:49:07,100 --> 02:49:08,059
I feel like it's gonna be...

3617
02:49:08,059 --> 02:49:09,340
We've already seen one of these.

3618
02:49:16,420 --> 02:49:18,579
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3619
02:49:18,579 --> 02:49:20,979
This is the guy that typically does all the voiceovers.

3620
02:49:20,979 --> 02:49:23,540
But he's like talking like he's from New York.

3621
02:49:36,370 --> 02:49:37,010
Is this the same guy?

3622
02:49:41,809 --> 02:49:43,649
Wait, what is this thing?

3623
02:49:46,500 --> 02:49:46,739
What?

3624
02:49:53,020 --> 02:49:53,979
That's not gonna...

3625
02:49:53,979 --> 02:49:54,780
That doesn't happen.

3626
02:49:55,340 --> 02:49:55,579
Right?

3627
02:49:57,180 --> 02:50:03,329
Will this actually do this?

3628
02:50:04,049 --> 02:50:06,260
I feel like it would just not...

3629
02:50:06,260 --> 02:50:07,059
It would just move around.

3630
02:50:15,229 --> 02:50:16,510
Meatball hot dog?

3631
02:50:16,510 --> 02:50:17,629
Oh no, that was a meatball sub.

3632
02:50:24,540 --> 02:50:25,280
Okay.

3633
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:29,969
I can't see shit with only six pixels.

3634
02:50:29,969 --> 02:50:31,250
Yeah, I couldn't really see that one.

3635
02:50:32,659 --> 02:50:33,299
Onion Bloom.

3636
02:50:33,299 --> 02:50:35,139
I think we already know what this one's gonna be.

3637
02:50:35,139 --> 02:50:38,049
These were so popular because of Outback.

3638
02:50:43,090 --> 02:50:44,049
You just don't.

3639
02:50:44,049 --> 02:50:44,450
You just don't.

3640
02:50:52,850 --> 02:50:54,690
Well, this one's a lot more work than some of the other ones.

3641
02:50:57,809 --> 02:50:59,170
Some of the other ones are just...

3642
02:50:59,170 --> 02:51:00,049
You crush it with the thing.

3643
02:51:00,049 --> 02:51:07,409
I think there are versions of this that are better.

3644
02:51:17,969 --> 02:51:19,010
All right, but that's not the hard part.

3645
02:51:21,409 --> 02:51:23,090
I feel like this is the easy part.

3646
02:51:23,090 --> 02:51:26,049
And deep frying the fucking thing is the annoying hard part.

3647
02:51:31,010 --> 02:51:32,049
Like, this is the part that sucks.

3648
02:51:32,049 --> 02:51:33,090
Like, the part...

3649
02:51:33,090 --> 02:51:34,209
Dumping it in the oil sucks.

3650
02:51:34,209 --> 02:51:34,770
And it's annoying.

3651
02:51:34,770 --> 02:51:35,409
It takes a lot of work.

3652
02:51:44,850 --> 02:51:46,610
Oh, I thought the onion was dishwasher.

3653
02:51:46,610 --> 02:51:48,610
I was like, why would you put an onion in the dishwasher, dude?

3654
02:51:52,450 --> 02:51:52,770
Okay.

3655
02:51:55,139 --> 02:51:55,459
All right.

3656
02:51:56,500 --> 02:51:58,100
We don't need to see muffin top magic.

3657
02:51:58,100 --> 02:52:02,370
We already know what this is.

3658
02:52:02,370 --> 02:52:03,969
It's gonna be another one of those cupcakes.

3659
02:52:03,969 --> 02:52:07,010
It's like, look, you can put filling in a cupcake.

3660
02:52:07,729 --> 02:52:09,170
You can put filling in a cupcake.

3661
02:52:09,170 --> 02:52:09,809
I'll just prove it to you.

3662
02:52:16,350 --> 02:52:16,670
What?

3663
02:52:20,909 --> 02:52:21,790
Who's doing this?

3664
02:52:26,209 --> 02:52:28,770
You throw the whole bottom away.

3665
02:52:29,409 --> 02:52:32,370
Have you tried those so-called muffin top fans

3666
02:52:32,370 --> 02:52:34,290
only to bake an inedible waste?

3667
02:52:34,290 --> 02:52:36,610
Then you're gonna love muffin top magic.

3668
02:52:36,610 --> 02:52:37,329
The best...

3669
02:52:37,329 --> 02:52:38,370
Shit-faced, yeah.

3670
02:52:38,370 --> 02:52:40,209
...to make the best part of any muffin...

3671
02:52:40,209 --> 02:52:40,770
I'm interested.

3672
02:52:40,770 --> 02:52:42,850
...and other sweet and savory tasty treats.

3673
02:52:42,850 --> 02:52:43,809
It's so easy.

3674
02:52:43,809 --> 02:52:44,370
Just add a...

3675
02:52:44,370 --> 02:52:45,489
There's always an egg sandwich.

3676
02:52:45,489 --> 02:52:46,209
...to each cup.

3677
02:52:46,209 --> 02:52:47,569
Place the patented muffin top...

3678
02:52:47,569 --> 02:52:49,569
Always an egg fucking sandwich.

3679
02:52:49,569 --> 02:52:52,049
Egg sandwich, egg sandwich, egg sandwich.

3680
02:52:52,049 --> 02:52:53,729
Every one of these makes egg sandwiches.

3681
02:52:53,729 --> 02:52:55,170
...muffin tops rise higher.

3682
02:52:55,170 --> 02:52:56,209
See the difference?

3683
02:52:56,209 --> 02:53:00,370
The result is super moist and flavorful muffin tops every time.

3684
02:53:00,370 --> 02:53:03,889
This fucking phone number is fake.

3685
02:53:06,159 --> 02:53:07,920
This number is not real.

3686
02:53:09,969 --> 02:53:13,010
What the fuck are you talking about?

3687
02:53:14,770 --> 02:53:17,889
Maybe, oh, it might have been because the number didn't exist anymore.

3688
02:53:17,889 --> 02:53:18,389
They...

3689
02:53:19,649 --> 02:53:22,049
Maybe for like re-uploading it to like YouTube or something

3690
02:53:22,049 --> 02:53:23,889
because it probably doesn't exist anymore.

3691
02:53:23,889 --> 02:53:25,010
They just made it a fake number.

3692
02:53:25,489 --> 02:53:26,129
That would make sense.

3693
02:53:26,129 --> 02:53:29,409
...while the muffin top rises to a glorious crunchy golden brown.

3694
02:53:29,409 --> 02:53:31,489
And muffin tops are only the beginning.

3695
02:53:31,489 --> 02:53:33,170
Make perfect poached eggs.

3696
02:53:33,170 --> 02:53:34,930
Cheddar garlic biscuits for dinner.

3697
02:53:34,930 --> 02:53:36,930
Healthy after-school pizza snacks.

3698
02:53:36,930 --> 02:53:40,290
And these incredible cupcake tops will make you a winner.

3699
02:53:40,290 --> 02:53:42,770
Even delicious stuffed chocolate crescent rolls

3700
02:53:42,770 --> 02:53:45,010
or sliders that will warm your soul.

3701
02:53:45,010 --> 02:53:46,209
You need to use all these?

3702
02:53:47,649 --> 02:53:49,010
That's a whole other ordeal.

3703
02:53:49,010 --> 02:53:49,510
Maybe.

3704
02:53:51,649 --> 02:53:52,370
And we're gonna get two.

3705
02:53:52,370 --> 02:53:53,649
...and get one free.

3706
02:53:53,969 --> 02:53:54,610
Five, five, five.

3707
02:53:54,610 --> 02:53:55,969
Five, five, five, five, five.

3708
02:53:55,969 --> 02:53:57,649
...to lift and serve your...

3709
02:53:57,649 --> 02:53:59,170
Ooh, you get a spatula too.

3710
02:53:59,170 --> 02:54:00,370
...and we're still not done.

3711
02:54:00,370 --> 02:54:03,250
The first 500 callers get the better buddy too.

3712
02:54:03,250 --> 02:54:04,370
It dispenses the...

3713
02:54:04,370 --> 02:54:05,489
Also, how does that work?

3714
02:54:07,549 --> 02:54:10,770
What's the idea behind that?

3715
02:54:10,770 --> 02:54:14,290
If you call within the next 30 minutes, then you'll get this.

3716
02:54:16,610 --> 02:54:17,889
Does that mean that like...

3717
02:54:17,889 --> 02:54:20,290
Okay, so if the first 500 callers...

3718
02:54:20,290 --> 02:54:25,250
What if your caller number 502, 503, 501, 504?

3719
02:54:26,430 --> 02:54:27,309
What happens?

3720
02:54:30,219 --> 02:54:31,979
Can they say that?

3721
02:54:31,979 --> 02:54:35,700
Because like the first 500 callers,

3722
02:54:35,700 --> 02:54:39,620
at the start of the airing of this commercial, right?

3723
02:54:39,620 --> 02:54:41,780
Or like, oh, if you call in the next 30 minutes,

3724
02:54:41,780 --> 02:54:44,659
the commercial is constantly airing somewhere, right?

3725
02:54:44,659 --> 02:54:47,489
So if you have syndicated commercial

3726
02:54:47,489 --> 02:54:49,409
that will play in every time zone,

3727
02:54:49,409 --> 02:54:51,500
30 to 40 minutes away from each other,

3728
02:54:51,500 --> 02:54:53,340
it'll always be 30 minutes, right?

3729
02:54:53,340 --> 02:54:54,059
Always.

3730
02:54:54,059 --> 02:54:58,059
How does that specific...

3731
02:54:58,059 --> 02:54:59,739
How does that work specifically?

3732
02:54:59,739 --> 02:55:03,700
It's just a lie.

3733
02:55:03,700 --> 02:55:05,219
It builds FOMO.

3734
02:55:05,219 --> 02:55:06,989
I know it builds FOMO,

3735
02:55:06,989 --> 02:55:08,590
but if your caller number...

3736
02:55:08,590 --> 02:55:10,430
Okay, let's say that if you were...

3737
02:55:10,989 --> 02:55:14,670
Okay, let's say I got 500 people that all were like,

3738
02:55:14,670 --> 02:55:15,790
I want to buy this product.

3739
02:55:15,790 --> 02:55:18,750
They're like, okay, everyone call and buy the product.

3740
02:55:19,389 --> 02:55:22,190
And then the 500 first person calls

3741
02:55:22,190 --> 02:55:23,790
within the same like hour or two, right?

3742
02:55:23,790 --> 02:55:25,469
And like the 500 first person's like, I want to buy it.

3743
02:55:25,469 --> 02:55:25,709
Do they...

3744
02:55:27,709 --> 02:55:30,829
If I can prove that this is caller number 501,

3745
02:55:30,829 --> 02:55:32,209
what would happen?

3746
02:55:34,100 --> 02:55:35,299
Everybody gets it.

3747
02:55:35,299 --> 02:55:36,180
Everybody gets it back.

3748
02:55:36,180 --> 02:55:36,500
Yeah, I know.

3749
02:55:36,500 --> 02:55:37,940
But like, what if you proved it?

3750
02:55:39,709 --> 02:55:40,350
They don't care.

3751
02:55:40,350 --> 02:55:40,989
They're not counting.

3752
02:55:47,149 --> 02:55:48,350
You're just lying though.

3753
02:55:48,350 --> 02:55:50,909
How many people aren't actually gonna call?

3754
02:55:53,549 --> 02:55:58,270
You say that, but if you turn on like QVC or HSN

3755
02:55:58,270 --> 02:56:00,270
or like home shopping networks, right?

3756
02:56:00,270 --> 02:56:03,709
Like all those networks that existed.

3757
02:56:03,709 --> 02:56:04,510
They ran...

3758
02:56:04,510 --> 02:56:10,670
They would sell out during the presentation.

3759
02:56:10,670 --> 02:56:11,709
They would sell out.

3760
02:56:11,709 --> 02:56:14,030
They'd be like, okay, we only have the red ones left.

3761
02:56:14,590 --> 02:56:15,629
People do this.

3762
02:56:15,629 --> 02:56:16,270
People call.

3763
02:56:16,270 --> 02:56:18,659
People do.

3764
02:56:18,659 --> 02:56:20,020
Unless it's manufactured.

3765
02:56:20,020 --> 02:56:21,379
But people would go on...

3766
02:56:21,379 --> 02:56:23,940
I remember they're like, oh, we've got this vacuum on QVC.

3767
02:56:23,940 --> 02:56:25,219
And it'd be like in three colors.

3768
02:56:25,219 --> 02:56:28,020
And the person would be like, oh, I'm getting word.

3769
02:56:28,020 --> 02:56:29,860
We don't have any more blue vacuums left.

3770
02:56:29,860 --> 02:56:32,180
And they'd have like a little sold out thing on it.

3771
02:56:32,180 --> 02:56:38,610
Why would they say you can't buy it?

3772
02:56:38,610 --> 02:56:39,569
Old people buy that.

3773
02:56:44,590 --> 02:56:47,469
But why would they want to limit the amount of product they could sell?

3774
02:56:47,469 --> 02:56:53,139
All right, how's the mix and bake?

3775
02:56:53,139 --> 02:56:56,020
Do you love to bake a delicious homemade cake?

3776
02:56:56,020 --> 02:56:58,030
Mix the batter.

3777
02:56:58,030 --> 02:56:58,670
Let me guess.

3778
02:56:58,670 --> 02:57:00,989
It's going to be silicone and it's going to be...

3779
02:57:00,989 --> 02:57:01,549
There it is.

3780
02:57:01,549 --> 02:57:02,350
Mix and bake.

3781
02:57:02,350 --> 02:57:05,649
So let's you mix and bake a cake.

3782
02:57:05,649 --> 02:57:06,370
What the...

3783
02:57:06,370 --> 02:57:07,090
Whoa!

3784
02:57:07,090 --> 02:57:07,889
Actually, that was cool.

3785
02:57:07,889 --> 02:57:09,090
So there's no messy...

3786
02:57:09,090 --> 02:57:10,129
Whoa, dude.

3787
02:57:10,129 --> 02:57:14,770
Mix and bake is a full-size deep dish bowl.

3788
02:57:14,770 --> 02:57:16,209
But can it make an egg sandwich?

3789
02:57:16,209 --> 02:57:16,690
Put it down.

3790
02:57:16,690 --> 02:57:19,010
Place it in the oven and bake your cake.

3791
02:57:19,010 --> 02:57:22,000
The Dory baking...

3792
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:24,239
I don't know if I want this unless it can make fucking poached eggs.

3793
02:57:24,239 --> 02:57:26,399
...from the silicone and the cake.

3794
02:57:26,399 --> 02:57:27,520
No sticking.

3795
02:57:27,520 --> 02:57:28,239
The secret is...

3796
02:57:28,239 --> 02:57:28,719
That's cool.

3797
02:57:28,799 --> 02:57:32,399
...jewel chamber design that lets you mix and bake in one pan.

3798
02:57:32,399 --> 02:57:33,520
This is a cool thing, I think.

3799
02:57:33,520 --> 02:57:34,559
...for perfect cake every time.

3800
02:57:34,559 --> 02:57:37,329
There's never enough room for baking pans.

3801
02:57:37,329 --> 02:57:38,049
But mix and bake...

3802
02:57:38,049 --> 02:57:39,010
Do some organization.

3803
02:57:39,010 --> 02:57:43,100
...for easy storage full of dishes.

3804
02:57:43,100 --> 02:57:44,700
But mix and bake is the perfect way...

3805
02:57:44,700 --> 02:57:46,139
Just take it all out and you can put it...

3806
02:57:46,139 --> 02:57:47,739
You could reorganize that in a minute.

3807
02:57:47,739 --> 02:57:48,299
...to make this cake clean up.

3808
02:57:48,299 --> 02:57:49,260
Takes the cake.

3809
02:57:49,260 --> 02:57:50,780
Just mix, pop, and bake in one pan.

3810
02:57:50,780 --> 02:57:51,579
I like that, though.

3811
02:57:51,579 --> 02:57:52,379
That's pretty cool.

3812
02:57:52,379 --> 02:57:54,059
No mess, no stress.

3813
02:57:54,059 --> 02:57:56,139
Plus it's BPA-free and dishwasher-free.

3814
02:57:56,139 --> 02:57:57,020
BPA-free.

3815
02:57:57,020 --> 02:58:00,780
Grandkids love to bake a cake and enjoy the magic of mix and bake.

3816
02:58:00,780 --> 02:58:05,790
Grandma, just mix and bake a cake that company will love.

3817
02:58:05,790 --> 02:58:07,469
That cabinet is actually my house.

3818
02:58:07,469 --> 02:58:10,610
Pop, pop, pop of birthday delight, that first bite.

3819
02:58:10,610 --> 02:58:12,610
Now you can mix, pop, and bake...

3820
02:58:12,610 --> 02:58:18,770
These companies know a very, very important constant truth across all of us.

3821
02:58:19,819 --> 02:58:21,500
And that constant truth is always this.

3822
02:58:22,659 --> 02:58:27,340
You have in your place right now, in your home or your apartment,

3823
02:58:27,340 --> 02:58:33,100
you have probably three or four randomly fucking sized random-ass oven pans.

3824
02:58:34,290 --> 02:58:36,370
That you don't know why you still have.

3825
02:58:37,629 --> 02:58:39,790
You've had them for potentially fucking years.

3826
02:58:40,430 --> 02:58:40,829
They're like...

3827
02:58:40,829 --> 02:58:42,819
They look like shit.

3828
02:58:42,819 --> 02:58:46,479
They're kind of like discolored and like kind of weird looking.

3829
02:58:46,479 --> 02:58:48,719
And you have like four of them and they're just randomly sized

3830
02:58:48,719 --> 02:58:50,079
and you just won't get rid of them.

3831
02:58:50,079 --> 02:58:50,719
Ever.

3832
02:58:50,719 --> 02:58:51,780
And you just use them.

3833
02:58:51,780 --> 02:58:52,659
You just use them always.

3834
02:58:53,379 --> 02:58:55,700
So they know that everybody has that.

3835
02:58:55,700 --> 02:58:58,819
So they just tap into that by going,

3836
02:58:58,819 --> 02:58:59,459
Look, you don't...

3837
02:58:59,459 --> 02:59:04,500
I know you have that cabinet full of those randomly like discolored random-sized pans.

3838
02:59:04,500 --> 02:59:06,899
So just get this and you'll be fine.

3839
02:59:06,899 --> 02:59:11,020
And then people like me or like you will do that.

3840
02:59:11,020 --> 02:59:14,049
Because like, yeah, fuck man.

3841
02:59:14,049 --> 02:59:21,010
I guess I do have like a baking tray that I've had since like 2003.

3842
02:59:25,340 --> 02:59:26,059
And it's...

3843
02:59:26,059 --> 02:59:27,420
You don't even know why you still have it.

3844
02:59:27,420 --> 02:59:28,540
Why won't you just replace it?

3845
02:59:29,739 --> 02:59:30,459
Replace it.

3846
02:59:30,459 --> 02:59:30,959
Why?

3847
02:59:33,069 --> 02:59:33,950
I won't do it.

3848
02:59:33,950 --> 02:59:35,309
I should.

3849
02:59:35,309 --> 02:59:36,350
But I'm not going to.

3850
02:59:36,350 --> 02:59:37,389
I don't know why.

3851
02:59:37,389 --> 02:59:38,530
All right, what about the brew stick?

3852
02:59:40,100 --> 02:59:42,180
We all need that morning cup of Joe.

3853
02:59:42,180 --> 02:59:44,340
But brewing a whole pot is a waste.

3854
02:59:44,340 --> 02:59:46,739
It's like pouring cash in the trash.

3855
02:59:46,739 --> 02:59:48,100
Introducing brew stick.

3856
02:59:48,100 --> 02:59:52,260
The amazing new way to make delicious single serve coffee in seconds.

3857
02:59:52,260 --> 02:59:52,899
Watch.

3858
02:59:52,899 --> 02:59:55,700
Just scoop the brew stick into your favorite brand of coffee.

3859
02:59:55,700 --> 02:59:58,420
Lock it closed and stir into a mug of hot water.

3860
02:59:58,420 --> 03:00:01,059
Just stir it longer if you want it stronger.

3861
03:00:01,059 --> 03:00:06,260
The secret is our exclusive micro mesh that infuses coffee into hot water for rich...

3862
03:00:06,260 --> 03:00:07,059
This is not...

3863
03:00:07,059 --> 03:00:08,020
This is not going to make coffee.

3864
03:00:08,020 --> 03:00:09,540
...the perfect cup of coffee.

3865
03:00:09,540 --> 03:00:12,420
Stir mouth-watering French vanilla coffee at your desk.

3866
03:00:12,420 --> 03:00:14,819
Drink delicious hazelnut when you travel.

3867
03:00:14,819 --> 03:00:17,860
While camping, enjoy piping hot amaretto coffee.

3868
03:00:17,860 --> 03:00:20,979
Single serve disposable pods cost 70 cents a cup.

3869
03:00:20,979 --> 03:00:21,940
Brew stick holds the...

3870
03:00:21,940 --> 03:00:23,139
Hold on, I'm biting my lip.

3871
03:00:23,139 --> 03:00:25,459
...but without the expense or the waste.

3872
03:00:25,459 --> 03:00:26,659
Brew stick works with tea...

3873
03:00:26,659 --> 03:00:29,459
Doesn't coffee need to pressurize through beans?

3874
03:00:29,459 --> 03:00:31,700
Lock it closed, stir, and enjoy.

3875
03:00:31,700 --> 03:00:34,100
You can even make iced tea or iced coffee.

3876
03:00:34,100 --> 03:00:38,420
Here are some first-time reactions to our blind taste test against instant coffee.

3877
03:00:38,420 --> 03:00:41,299
This is definitely a much crisper, fresher taste.

3878
03:00:41,299 --> 03:00:42,579
This one's very good.

3879
03:00:42,579 --> 03:00:44,500
This you can tell is like instant.

3880
03:00:44,500 --> 03:00:47,780
Well, what they didn't tell him is we used toilet water for the left one.

3881
03:00:48,899 --> 03:00:50,420
Very rich and full-bodied.

3882
03:00:50,420 --> 03:00:52,180
Brew stick is dishwasher safe.

3883
03:00:52,180 --> 03:00:55,700
So you can enjoy delicious coffee over and over again.

3884
03:00:55,700 --> 03:00:57,540
Single serve pods are expensive.

3885
03:00:57,540 --> 03:01:01,299
Store-bought coffee at $2 a day adds up to $700...

3886
03:01:01,299 --> 03:01:02,899
That wouldn't brew coffee though, would it?

3887
03:01:02,899 --> 03:01:06,739
...fast, fresh, delicious single serve coffee with brew stick in red.

3888
03:01:06,819 --> 03:01:09,379
It would be kind of flavored water, wouldn't it?

3890

Just pay separate processes.

3892
03:01:14,020 --> 03:01:16,180
I mean, maybe if you left it in there for a long time.

3893
03:01:16,180 --> 03:01:18,579
Simply latte absolutely free.

3894
03:01:18,579 --> 03:01:20,659

Or a simply latte for just $10.

3899
03:01:26,260 --> 03:01:27,940
Click now.

3900
03:01:27,940 --> 03:01:29,889
I mean, I get the idea,

3901
03:01:29,889 --> 03:01:39,709
but I feel like it would take a lot longer than just simply going like this for one second.

3902
03:01:39,709 --> 03:01:41,149
All right, let's, let's...

3903
03:01:41,149 --> 03:01:43,069
Oh my god, time flies when you're having fun.

3904
03:01:43,069 --> 03:01:45,090
I've been doing this for three hours.

3905
03:01:45,090 --> 03:01:47,579
All right.

3906
03:01:47,579 --> 03:01:52,450
Wait, I got a lot of shit up here.

3907
03:01:52,450 --> 03:01:54,770
Let's go over here.

3908
03:01:54,770 --> 03:01:55,809
This is a different playlist.

3909
03:01:55,809 --> 03:01:59,420
This is like automotive products.

3910
03:01:59,420 --> 03:02:00,940
Oh my god, this is so bright.

3911
03:02:00,940 --> 03:02:02,540
Now I understand what you guys are talking about.

3912
03:02:02,540 --> 03:02:05,299
So what is this one?

3913
03:02:06,180 --> 03:02:07,569
Pretty good music.

3914
03:02:10,129 --> 03:02:10,629
What?

3915
03:02:15,250 --> 03:02:16,049
Holy shit.

3916
03:02:19,329 --> 03:02:20,850
What the fuck are you doing?

3917
03:02:24,290 --> 03:02:30,049
It's a second mirror?

3918
03:02:33,889 --> 03:02:34,370
Wait a minute.

3919
03:02:43,569 --> 03:02:44,129
Whoa.

3920
03:02:44,129 --> 03:02:44,850
Okay.

3921
03:02:44,850 --> 03:02:46,610
But how, what if it spalls off?

3922
03:02:50,850 --> 03:02:52,290
That looks like it's just kind of clipped on.

3923
03:02:54,290 --> 03:02:56,450
Revealing what's in your car's blind spots.

3924
03:02:56,450 --> 03:02:57,489
It couldn't be easier.

3925
03:02:57,489 --> 03:02:59,569
Clear zone mirror installs in seconds.

3926
03:02:59,569 --> 03:03:01,010
Adjust and you're ready to go.

3927
03:03:01,010 --> 03:03:01,729
Look again.

3928
03:03:01,729 --> 03:03:05,250
Clear zone instantly reveals the tractor trailer in your blood.

3929
03:03:05,250 --> 03:03:11,059
They've made it look like you're putting a webcam on top of your monitor.

3930
03:03:11,059 --> 03:03:14,420
If that's secure, then that, that's kind of helpful, isn't it?

3931
03:03:14,420 --> 03:03:17,700
You say clear zone makes parking in the tightest spots a breeze.

3932
03:03:17,700 --> 03:03:20,899
Back in with only inches to spare and let clear zone steer you clear.

3933
03:03:20,899 --> 03:03:21,399
No.

3934
03:03:23,459 --> 03:03:24,180
No, honey.

3935
03:03:24,180 --> 03:03:25,459
You can't pull.

3936
03:03:25,459 --> 03:03:26,899
That's too small of a space.

3937
03:03:27,459 --> 03:03:28,100
I got this.

3938
03:03:28,100 --> 03:03:28,739
What are you talking about?

3939
03:03:28,739 --> 03:03:30,540
I got the clear zone.

3940
03:03:30,540 --> 03:03:31,420
No, it's not big enough.

3941
03:03:31,420 --> 03:03:32,620
It's not, you know, you're going to hit something.

3942
03:03:32,620 --> 03:03:33,819
Please don't, just easy, easy.

3943
03:03:33,819 --> 03:03:34,059
You're going.

3944
03:03:34,059 --> 03:03:34,620
No, no, no, no, no.

3945
03:03:34,620 --> 03:03:35,180
Turn, turn the wheel.

3946
03:03:35,180 --> 03:03:35,739
Turn the wheel.

3947
03:03:35,739 --> 03:03:36,459
Turn the wheel.

3948
03:03:36,459 --> 03:03:38,670
And then they fucking crash into the garden dome.

3949
03:03:38,670 --> 03:03:41,389
Clear zone comes with a 10-year money-back guarantee.

3950
03:03:41,389 --> 03:03:43,149
If it breaks, get your money back.

3951
03:03:43,149 --> 03:03:44,350
Look at how close this is.

3952
03:03:44,350 --> 03:03:45,950
Parking in the tightest spots a breeze.

3953
03:03:45,950 --> 03:03:48,190
Back in with only inches to spare and let clear zone steer you clear.

3954
03:03:48,190 --> 03:03:49,469
No fucking.

3955
03:03:49,469 --> 03:03:50,670
I am not parking here.

3956
03:03:52,290 --> 03:03:56,370
If this is how much room I have to spare, how am I getting out of the car?

3957
03:03:57,090 --> 03:03:58,610
How are you getting out of the car?

3958
03:03:58,610 --> 03:04:02,129

03:04:07,090 --> 03:04:08,770

You're covered on both sides of your vehicle.

3968
03:04:22,530 --> 03:04:23,729
Just pay a separate fee.

3969
03:04:23,729 --> 03:04:24,850

3975
03:04:35,969 --> 03:04:36,850
Okay, clear zone.

3976
03:04:39,409 --> 03:04:39,889
All right.

3977
03:04:39,889 --> 03:04:43,889
If it's secure, if it's secure on there and it's really like on there, secure.

3978
03:04:43,889 --> 03:04:47,840
All right.

3979
03:04:47,840 --> 03:04:49,920
I don't want to watch screwdriver ones because who cares?

3980
03:04:49,920 --> 03:04:53,059
It's kind of boring.

3981
03:04:53,059 --> 03:04:56,479
The stream machine.

3982
03:04:56,479 --> 03:04:57,920
What's the stream machine?

3983
03:04:57,920 --> 03:04:58,979
We need to know.

3984
03:04:58,979 --> 03:05:06,750
Offer some annoying commercials.

3985
03:05:07,709 --> 03:05:12,770

3986

03:05:15,329 --> 03:05:15,809

You can because it makes you the DJ of your very own FM station.

3991
03:05:26,610 --> 03:05:27,649
Here's how it works.

3992
03:05:27,649 --> 03:05:30,129
Tune your radio to any unused FM station.

3993
03:05:30,129 --> 03:05:33,489

03:05:33,489 --> 03:05:36,129
That radio station now plays only what you want.

3995
03:05:36,209 --> 03:05:36,690
What?

3996
03:05:36,690 --> 03:05:40,530
And if you're using it in the car and you get a call, no problem.

3997
03:05:40,530 --> 03:05:41,250
Hey, honey.

3998
03:05:41,250 --> 03:05:42,530
Hey, are you close?

3999
03:05:42,530 --> 03:05:44,209
So just left the grocery store.

4000
03:05:44,209 --> 03:05:46,850

03:06:18,450 --> 03:06:22,770
We're just about to play your favorite song, but first some more annoying commercials.

4013
03:06:22,770 --> 03:06:24,049
Oh, come on.

4014
03:06:24,049 --> 03:06:26,610
When you can create your own commercial-free radio station.

4015
03:06:26,610 --> 03:06:28,049
This lady's pissed.

4016
03:06:28,049 --> 03:06:29,409
This lady's angry.

4017
03:06:29,409 --> 03:06:31,170
Plus find out about special pricing.

4018
03:06:31,170 --> 03:06:32,850
This lady's very mad.

4019
03:06:32,850 --> 03:06:37,090
Just attach it to your air vent, insert your phone, and you can select songs or answer

4020
03:06:37,090 --> 03:06:39,569
calls without taking your attention off the road.

4021
03:06:39,569 --> 03:06:40,530
And there's more.

4022
03:06:40,530 --> 03:06:43,010
Order today and you can get a second stream machine.

4023
03:06:43,010 --> 03:06:44,049
Just pay a separate fee.

4024
03:06:44,049 --> 03:06:45,329
Are these even real cars?

4025
03:06:45,329 --> 03:06:45,809
And there's more.

4026
03:06:45,809 --> 03:06:46,450
Order today.

4027
03:06:46,450 --> 03:06:47,649
Attention off the road.

4028
03:06:47,649 --> 03:06:48,610
I mean, he's in it.

4029
03:06:48,610 --> 03:06:52,350
He's green screened in, but I mean.

4030
03:06:52,350 --> 03:06:53,940
More.

4031
03:06:53,940 --> 03:06:56,340
Order today and you can get a second stream machine.

4032
03:06:56,340 --> 03:06:57,620
Just pay a separate fee.

4033
03:06:57,620 --> 03:07:01,299
That's two stream machines and special pricing on our smart grid for just $14.99.

4034
03:07:01,379 --> 03:07:03,780
Apparently this technology works.

4035
03:07:05,059 --> 03:07:11,280
Back in the day, back in the mid-2000s, this probably would have been a very good idea.

4036
03:07:11,280 --> 03:07:11,780
Right?

4037
03:07:12,979 --> 03:07:14,909
The car of L.A.

4038
03:07:14,909 --> 03:07:16,110
The car cane.

4039
03:07:16,110 --> 03:07:17,629
What is the car cane?

4040
03:07:17,629 --> 03:07:21,250
Have you ever struggled to get out of the car?

4041
03:07:21,250 --> 03:07:23,569
Does back or knee pain make it hard?

4042
03:07:23,569 --> 03:07:26,370
Do you push with your arm when you try to stand?

4043
03:07:26,370 --> 03:07:28,770
Or ask someone to give you a hand?

4044
03:07:28,770 --> 03:07:33,729
Then let us help you out with the incredible new car cane.

4045
03:07:33,729 --> 03:07:36,450
Now you can get in and out of your car with ease.

4046
03:07:36,450 --> 03:07:40,770
This new portable handle locks instantly into the door latches of any car.

4047
03:07:40,770 --> 03:07:43,090
Simply open your door and snap it on.

4048
03:07:43,090 --> 03:07:44,610
Car cane locks into place.

4049
03:07:44,610 --> 03:07:45,649
Actually, it's kind of.

4050
03:07:45,649 --> 03:07:47,409
In fact, car canes.

4051
03:07:47,409 --> 03:07:49,729
Well, don't get down from there.

4052
03:07:49,729 --> 03:07:50,610
Get down from there.

4053
03:07:51,489 --> 03:07:55,409
If you're having trouble getting out of the car, don't go climb up there.

4054
03:07:55,409 --> 03:07:56,450
What the fuck?

4055
03:07:56,450 --> 03:08:01,489
If you are recovering from an injury or suffer from back pain, knee pain, or hip pain,

4056
03:08:01,489 --> 03:08:03,329
you need the car cane.

4057
03:08:03,329 --> 03:08:08,450
And when it's slippery outside, car cane gives you a handy grip so you won't slip.

4058
03:08:08,450 --> 03:08:12,610
It's perfect for those tall SUVs or low compact cars, too.

4059
03:08:12,610 --> 03:08:15,569
So stop struggling and get up with ease.

4060
03:08:15,569 --> 03:08:17,809
It was difficult to get out on my own.

4061
03:08:17,809 --> 03:08:20,370
Now I carry my car cane and help myself.

4062
03:08:21,250 --> 03:08:23,729
I mean, that's a pretty decent solution, I think.

4063
03:08:23,729 --> 03:08:25,010
And look at this.

4064
03:08:25,010 --> 03:08:26,850
Car cane has a built-in flash.

4065
03:08:26,850 --> 03:08:27,809
Yo, come on.

4066
03:08:27,809 --> 03:08:28,209
Look at that.

4067
03:08:28,209 --> 03:08:30,850
Right LEDs can last 100,000 hours.

4068
03:08:32,290 --> 03:08:32,610
What?

4069
03:08:32,610 --> 03:08:35,329
The car cane is so well built, it will last a lifetime.

4070
03:08:35,329 --> 03:08:37,170
100,000 hours?

4071
03:08:37,170 --> 03:08:42,370
Call and get your car cane today for just $19.95 plus processing and handling.

4072
03:08:42,370 --> 03:08:44,450

4073
03:08:44,450 --> 03:08:45,569
But wait.

4074
03:08:45,569 --> 03:08:46,370
I think that's helpful.

4075
03:08:46,370 --> 03:08:46,930
That's useful.

4076
03:08:46,930 --> 03:08:48,290
Swivel seat free.

4077
03:08:48,290 --> 03:08:50,129
Just pay separate processing and handling.

4078
03:08:50,129 --> 03:08:50,930
Oh, wow.

4079
03:08:50,930 --> 03:08:52,290
Actually, I want this.

4080
03:08:52,290 --> 03:08:57,409
This unique center cutout to reduce pressure and provide a soft seat for the driver or

4081
03:08:57,409 --> 03:08:58,129
passenger.

4082
03:08:58,129 --> 03:09:01,969
And when it's time to get out, it pivots and turns for an easy.

4083
03:09:01,969 --> 03:09:02,850
That's okay.

4084
03:09:02,850 --> 03:09:03,170
All right.

4085
03:09:03,170 --> 03:09:04,049
This is helpful.

4086
03:09:04,049 --> 03:09:04,690
That's pretty helpful.

4087
03:09:04,690 --> 03:09:06,690
The car cane and the swivel seat.

4088
03:09:06,690 --> 03:09:07,250
So help yourself.

4089
03:09:07,250 --> 03:09:08,209
That's helpful.

4090
03:09:08,209 --> 03:09:08,690
That's helpful.

4091
03:09:08,690 --> 03:09:09,889
Get your car cane today.

4092
03:09:09,889 --> 03:09:10,450
That's helpful.

4093
03:09:13,340 --> 03:09:14,780
The extra view mirror.

4094
03:09:14,780 --> 03:09:15,500
Another one of these.

4095
03:09:19,309 --> 03:09:20,110
Whoa, look out.

4096
03:09:22,590 --> 03:09:24,350
Wait, what was in your rear view?

4097
03:09:24,350 --> 03:09:26,110
You still can't see everything.

4098
03:09:26,110 --> 03:09:27,790
Now you can practically say.

4099
03:09:27,790 --> 03:09:28,909
But wait a minute.

4100
03:09:28,909 --> 03:09:30,909
You check and check and you still.

4101
03:09:31,790 --> 03:09:33,309
What was going on with this lady's mirror?

4102
03:09:34,270 --> 03:09:36,110
I know what the fucking problem is, lady.

4103
03:09:37,120 --> 03:09:40,079
Your mirror is turned all the way in.

4104
03:09:40,079 --> 03:09:43,360
So you're only seeing your reflection driving the car.

4105
03:09:43,360 --> 03:09:48,620
You need to put the mirror out and fan it out, lady.

4106
03:09:48,620 --> 03:09:49,739
What are you doing?

4107
03:09:49,739 --> 03:09:51,100
Where did he come from?

4108
03:09:51,100 --> 03:09:54,139
You check and check and you still can't see everything.

4109
03:09:54,139 --> 03:09:58,059
Now you can practically say goodbye to blind spots with extra view.

4110
03:09:58,059 --> 03:10:03,420
This is a wide screen that gives you a true 180 degree view.

4111
03:10:03,420 --> 03:10:07,139
Look, ordinary really give you a field of view this wide.

4112
03:10:07,139 --> 03:10:10,979
But extra view expands your visibility to a full one.

4113
03:10:10,979 --> 03:10:12,180
How much does it take up though?

4114
03:10:12,180 --> 03:10:13,540
I feel like it'd be a lot of space.

4115
03:10:13,540 --> 03:10:17,299
Anti-glare chrome coated glass that lets you see up to three lanes wide.

4116
03:10:17,299 --> 03:10:19,620
So nothing will hide with extra view.

4117
03:10:19,620 --> 03:10:21,940
You're seeing when this get in the way.

4118
03:10:21,940 --> 03:10:23,940
Look at the difference of your actual vision.

4119
03:10:23,940 --> 03:10:27,540
Children, I am constantly adjusting my old mirror trying to get a view

4120
03:10:27,540 --> 03:10:29,700
of the entire car with extra view.

4121
03:10:29,700 --> 03:10:30,979
I don't have to touch anything.

4122
03:10:30,979 --> 03:10:34,180
I can see the entire vehicle from window to window, top to bottom.

4123
03:10:34,180 --> 03:10:36,819
With extra view, you can see the entire three lanes.

4124
03:10:36,819 --> 03:10:38,260
All three lanes?

4125
03:10:38,260 --> 03:10:40,979
Now turning around before, after.

4126
03:10:40,979 --> 03:10:42,739
The difference is crystal clear.

4127
03:10:42,739 --> 03:10:44,659
And extra view makes night driving easier.

4128
03:10:44,659 --> 03:10:45,540
How does it do that?

4129
03:10:45,540 --> 03:10:48,420
Watch high beams and those new LED headlights

4130
03:10:48,420 --> 03:10:50,340
can really hurt your eyes at night.

4131
03:10:50,340 --> 03:10:53,540
But extra view reduces glare by up to 50%.

4132
03:10:53,540 --> 03:10:56,020
Making night driving safer and more comfortable.

4133
03:10:56,020 --> 03:10:56,260
Okay.

4134
03:10:56,260 --> 03:10:59,540
Ordinary mirrors make you twist your neck to check and recheck.

4135
03:10:59,620 --> 03:11:01,459
But extra view lets you see it all.

4136
03:11:01,459 --> 03:11:03,139
What just snaps on?

4137
03:11:03,139 --> 03:11:04,500
It's so much more comfortable.

4138
03:11:04,500 --> 03:11:06,899
Extra view quickly attaches to a regular mirror.

4139
03:11:06,899 --> 03:11:09,219
Snapping on or off in seconds.

4140
03:11:09,219 --> 03:11:12,500
Now when you're merging, changing lanes and backing up.

4141
03:11:12,500 --> 03:11:15,059
Extra view makes it safer and easier to do.

4142
03:11:15,059 --> 03:11:18,100
Is this somebody said is this legal for being on for road use?

4143
03:11:18,100 --> 03:11:19,459
I mean, I think so.

4144
03:11:20,260 --> 03:11:21,540
Day and night.

4145
03:11:21,540 --> 03:11:23,940
Similar items sell in catalogs for up to $6.

4146
03:11:23,940 --> 03:11:25,459
Yeah, I don't know.

4147
03:11:25,459 --> 03:11:28,500
Why would it be illegal for just $14.95?

4148
03:11:28,500 --> 03:11:31,540
As a bonus, we'll send you a second extra view free.

4149
03:11:31,540 --> 03:11:32,100
For what?

4150
03:11:32,100 --> 03:11:33,219
For another car?

4151
03:11:33,219 --> 03:11:35,620
You get this incredible double offer.

4152
03:11:35,620 --> 03:11:36,979
Log on to extra view mirror.

4153
03:11:36,979 --> 03:11:37,860
I actually have one of these.

4154
03:11:37,860 --> 03:11:39,059
It works as advertised.

4155
03:11:40,450 --> 03:11:42,590
Yeah, all right.

4156
03:11:42,590 --> 03:11:44,670
Hey, look, I'm not saying any of these products don't work.

4157
03:11:44,670 --> 03:11:51,540
I'm just saying it's interesting, kind of strange oddities, right?

4158
03:11:51,540 --> 03:11:53,790
HD Vision Ultra.

4159
03:11:53,790 --> 03:11:55,870
Oh yeah, this is going to be a fucking doozy.

4160
03:11:56,430 --> 03:12:01,229
Just imagine being able to see your entire world in high definition.

4161
03:12:01,229 --> 03:12:02,750
The clarity is just unbelievable.

4162
03:12:02,750 --> 03:12:03,870
That's what I'm saying.

4163
03:12:03,870 --> 03:12:05,309
It's just like gunner optic.

4164
03:12:05,309 --> 03:12:06,510
High definition.

4165
03:12:06,510 --> 03:12:07,469
It's impeccable.

4166
03:12:07,469 --> 03:12:08,350
It's gorgeous.

4167
03:12:08,350 --> 03:12:10,030
It's like, wow, HD Vision.

4168
03:12:10,030 --> 03:12:11,149
It's crystal clear.

4169
03:12:11,149 --> 03:12:12,030
They're amazing.

4170
03:12:12,030 --> 03:12:13,149
HD quality.

4171
03:12:13,149 --> 03:12:17,870
They're talking about HD Vision Ultras, the brand new sunglasses that give you

4172
03:12:17,870 --> 03:12:19,870
our trademark high definition color.

4173
03:12:19,870 --> 03:12:22,909
And you're probably wondering why our commercial is not in HD.

4174
03:12:22,909 --> 03:12:24,590
It's actually in 480p.

4175
03:12:24,590 --> 03:12:29,420
Reduce glare and increase color and like no other glasses you've ever.

4176
03:12:29,420 --> 03:12:31,170
These are amazing.

4177
03:12:31,250 --> 03:12:32,290
And these do the job.

4178
03:12:34,620 --> 03:12:35,899
It's incredible.

4179
03:12:35,899 --> 03:12:37,739
Other glasses just make things darker.

4180
03:12:37,739 --> 03:12:39,180
Oh, the world looks like shit.

4181
03:12:39,180 --> 03:12:42,860
HD vision lenses enhance colors and they have great styling.

4182
03:12:42,860 --> 03:12:43,899
I got thumbs up from the wife.

4183
03:12:43,899 --> 03:12:44,379
I'll take them.

4184
03:12:45,659 --> 03:12:49,100
I can see how blue the ocean is, the sky, every cloud.

4185
03:12:49,100 --> 03:12:50,700
I mean, really, it's unbelievable.

4186
03:12:50,700 --> 03:12:52,459
They're really very cool.

4187
03:12:52,459 --> 03:12:55,020
These sunglasses are just phenomenal.

4188
03:12:56,219 --> 03:12:57,739
Excuse me, cut that one.

4189
03:12:57,739 --> 03:12:59,260
These are HD glasses.

4190
03:12:59,260 --> 03:13:00,139
As a special offer.

4191
03:13:00,139 --> 03:13:01,100
They're not sunglasses.

4192
03:13:01,100 --> 03:13:03,659
Giving away HD Ultras for just $10.

4193
03:13:03,659 --> 03:13:05,659
Wait, hold on.

4194
03:13:05,659 --> 03:13:06,780
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

4195
03:13:07,340 --> 03:13:09,899
We're giving away.

4196
03:13:09,899 --> 03:13:11,819
HD Ultras for just $10.

03:13:11,819 --> 03:13:13,500

4198
03:13:13,500 --> 03:13:15,180
You're giving them away for $10.

4199
03:13:15,180 --> 03:13:16,219
That's right, $10.

4200
03:13:17,100 --> 03:13:19,739
Other sunglasses sell for 100, 200, even 300.

4201
03:13:19,739 --> 03:13:20,620
I don't think that's what that means.

4202
03:13:21,260 --> 03:13:23,819
And they don't have high definition lenses.

4203
03:13:23,819 --> 03:13:25,100
That's an awesome price.

4204
03:13:25,100 --> 03:13:26,219
Are you kidding me?

4205
03:13:26,219 --> 03:13:30,459
I've got a $129 pair of sunglasses that are not this good.

4206
03:13:30,459 --> 03:13:31,659
And that's the truth.

4207
03:13:31,659 --> 03:13:33,579

4211
03:13:41,979 --> 03:13:45,340

They really are high definition.

4215
03:13:54,219 --> 03:13:54,940
Don't wait.

4216
03:13:54,940 --> 03:13:55,819

Fiber fix.

4225
03:14:24,049 --> 03:14:26,079
All right.

4226
03:14:26,079 --> 03:14:28,510
I'm thinking Popsident.

4227
03:14:28,510 --> 03:14:29,309
No more cars.

4228
03:14:29,309 --> 03:14:30,190
All right.

4229
03:14:30,190 --> 03:14:31,629
One or two more cars.

4230
03:14:31,629 --> 03:14:33,020
I want to see Popsident.

4231
03:14:41,139 --> 03:14:41,700
Who are you paying?

4232
03:14:46,100 --> 03:14:46,899
I remember these.

4233
03:14:48,739 --> 03:14:50,180
Popsident makes embarrassing.

4234
03:14:50,180 --> 03:14:50,420
Yeah.

4235
03:14:50,420 --> 03:14:51,139
I remember these.

4236
03:14:51,139 --> 03:14:52,899
You like pull the car out.

4237
03:14:52,899 --> 03:14:55,860
It's the same dead removal system used by body shops.

4238
03:14:55,860 --> 03:14:57,780
Except they charge big bucks.

4239
03:14:57,780 --> 03:14:59,299
Dense cars by hail.

4240
03:14:59,299 --> 03:15:00,020
Pop it.

4241
03:15:00,020 --> 03:15:01,139
Dings from car doors.

4242
03:15:01,139 --> 03:15:01,459
Yeah.

4243
03:15:01,459 --> 03:15:02,500
I think these things actually work.

4244
03:15:02,500 --> 03:15:03,780
Damage from shopping carts.

4245
03:15:04,819 --> 03:15:06,399
All right.

4246
03:15:06,399 --> 03:15:09,360
One more car.

4247
03:15:09,360 --> 03:15:12,420
Easy view HD sun shades.

4248
03:15:12,420 --> 03:15:14,670
Speed out.

4249
03:15:14,670 --> 03:15:15,549
What is speed now?

4250
03:15:15,549 --> 03:15:18,850
It's a screwdriver.

4251
03:15:18,850 --> 03:15:21,709
HD Vision night vision.

4252
03:15:21,709 --> 03:15:22,510
Easy glass.

4253
03:15:23,069 --> 03:15:28,299
The hook and hang.

4254
03:15:28,780 --> 03:15:30,780
Why is this person the shelf under?

4255
03:15:44,500 --> 03:15:45,219
That looks like mine.

4256
03:15:49,780 --> 03:15:51,219
That didn't really change very much.

4257
03:15:52,819 --> 03:15:54,020
Do flex seal?

4258
03:15:54,020 --> 03:15:54,659
We've all seen it.

4259
03:15:57,780 --> 03:16:00,340
But why this lady had a blindfold on?

4260
03:16:06,659 --> 03:16:08,180
And everything fits in place.

4261
03:16:08,979 --> 03:16:09,860
How is this for cars?

4262
03:16:15,860 --> 03:16:16,979
You can store your weights.

4263
03:16:23,379 --> 03:16:24,579
I know you guys want to hear the...

4264
03:16:24,579 --> 03:16:25,780
You want to hear the...

4265
03:16:25,780 --> 03:16:26,100
Okay.

4266
03:16:26,979 --> 03:16:28,420
You want to hear the...

4267
03:16:28,420 --> 03:16:29,940
Oh, that's a lot of damage.

4268
03:16:29,940 --> 03:16:30,659
I know.

4269
03:16:30,659 --> 03:16:31,299
I know I do too.

4270
03:16:32,340 --> 03:16:32,659
Okay.

4271
03:16:32,659 --> 03:16:37,459
I do too.

4272
03:16:37,459 --> 03:16:38,420
I know you want to hear it.

4273
03:16:38,420 --> 03:16:39,379
I know you want to see it.

4274
03:16:39,379 --> 03:16:39,860
Sure.

4275
03:16:39,860 --> 03:16:40,100
Fine.

4276
03:16:49,569 --> 03:16:50,610
They're really awesome.

4277
03:16:52,399 --> 03:16:52,719
Wait.

4278
03:16:52,719 --> 03:16:53,120
Clear?

4279
03:16:58,159 --> 03:16:59,040
It's clear now.

4280
03:17:07,040 --> 03:17:07,200
Okay.

4281
03:17:07,200 --> 03:17:08,319
Now one at a time this time.

4282
03:17:14,180 --> 03:17:15,379
Would you want to do it with sandals on?

4283
03:17:15,379 --> 03:17:17,139
I feel like you don't get that on your feet.

4284
03:17:18,819 --> 03:17:25,069
What happened?

4285
03:17:26,030 --> 03:17:28,670
Didn't this guy used to like take access to doors and like

4286
03:17:29,389 --> 03:17:31,389
throw like fucking barrels in the wall?

4287
03:17:34,879 --> 03:17:36,399
Didn't this guy used to like have a chainsaw?

4288
03:17:39,840 --> 03:17:49,059
That's flex tape.

4289
03:17:49,059 --> 03:17:49,379
Oh.

4290
03:17:56,260 --> 03:17:57,139
Actual.

4291
03:17:57,139 --> 03:17:58,180
Actual users.

4292
03:18:04,639 --> 03:18:09,219
Oh, this is not the one you guys wanted.

4293
03:18:09,219 --> 03:18:09,940
I'm sorry about that.

4294
03:18:10,879 --> 03:18:11,120
All right.

4295
03:18:11,120 --> 03:18:12,159
No more cars.

4296
03:18:12,159 --> 03:18:12,559
We'll do...

4297
03:18:12,559 --> 03:18:13,120
Oh my goodness.

4298
03:18:13,120 --> 03:18:14,989
That was loud.

4299
03:18:14,989 --> 03:18:19,700
How about the potty patch or the kitty shack?

4300
03:18:19,700 --> 03:18:20,899
I think we got to do kitty shack.

4301
03:18:29,100 --> 03:18:29,979
This is the cat house.

4302
03:18:34,219 --> 03:18:35,180
But it's just a bed.

4303
03:18:38,700 --> 03:18:42,059
Shack to convert from a comfy tube bed to a full-size cat.

4304
03:18:52,590 --> 03:18:53,790
I mean, that's kind of interesting.

4305
03:19:01,170 --> 03:19:01,569
I'm sorry.

4306
03:19:01,569 --> 03:19:04,770
But then like my dog or whatever,

4307
03:19:05,489 --> 03:19:06,770
they would sleep next to this,

4308
03:19:07,489 --> 03:19:08,450
but this wouldn't even use it.

4309
03:19:08,850 --> 03:19:20,690
Now, it'd be really funny if she was like,

4310
03:19:20,690 --> 03:19:21,969
I love the kitty shack too.

4311
03:19:21,969 --> 03:19:24,610
And she's like her like head sticking out of it.

4312
03:19:24,610 --> 03:19:25,409
She's like sleeping.

4313
03:19:33,489 --> 03:19:34,129
That's cool.

4314
03:19:34,129 --> 03:19:35,010
Add the kitty shack.

4315
03:19:39,170 --> 03:19:40,930
Is she wearing it on her head?

4316
03:19:48,559 --> 03:19:49,040
All right.

4317
03:19:54,559 --> 03:19:55,200
Okay, that's...

4318
03:20:00,159 --> 03:20:00,399
What?

4319
03:20:05,520 --> 03:20:06,799
All right, that's not...

4320
03:20:06,799 --> 03:20:07,520
That's affordable.

4321
03:20:08,399 --> 03:20:11,360
$14 for like two kitty shacks and the cats like it.

4322
03:20:13,659 --> 03:20:16,690
No, it's not the kitty shack.

4323
03:20:16,690 --> 03:20:17,250
That was cool.

4324
03:20:21,059 --> 03:20:21,620
All right.

4325
03:20:21,620 --> 03:20:23,549
The potty patch.

4326
03:20:23,549 --> 03:20:25,709
Is this just like a little patch of like grass?

4327
03:20:30,909 --> 03:20:32,030
That guy's not happy.

4328
03:20:32,829 --> 03:20:33,149
All right.

4329
03:20:33,149 --> 03:20:37,950
This guy has been to this house like a dozen times a month.

4330
03:20:37,950 --> 03:20:39,950
This carpet cleaner is getting sick and tired of coming to this house.

4331
03:20:45,149 --> 03:20:47,069
He's not peeing.

4332
03:20:47,950 --> 03:20:49,469
This is not real pee.

4333
03:20:49,469 --> 03:20:51,069
This is edited in piss.

4334
03:20:54,239 --> 03:20:57,360
Why would your dog be peeing that much?

4335
03:21:08,079 --> 03:21:08,319
Okay.

4336
03:21:10,239 --> 03:21:10,719
Where does it go?

4337
03:21:15,680 --> 03:21:18,239
The potty patch is the perfect solution.

4338
03:21:18,239 --> 03:21:20,799
The potty patch is ideal for training puppies.

4339
03:21:22,399 --> 03:21:23,680
Oh, there's pee everywhere.

4340
03:21:23,680 --> 03:21:24,799
Oh, what the fuck?

4341
03:21:27,600 --> 03:21:31,440
When dogs are left alone all day, they're going to have an accident or two.

4342
03:21:31,440 --> 03:21:34,159
I would rush home for work and would still find a mess.

4343
03:21:34,159 --> 03:21:36,399
There's no surprises with the potty patch.

4344
03:21:36,399 --> 03:21:37,600
And no more waiting...

4345
03:21:37,600 --> 03:21:39,840
Wait, that guy has a steamer.

4346
03:21:39,840 --> 03:21:44,559
The potty patch is ideal for apartment living and even works outdoors on your patio.

4347
03:21:44,559 --> 03:21:47,120
Potty patch is the best training aid ever.

4348
03:21:47,120 --> 03:21:49,280
I've seen it work the very first use.

4349
03:21:49,280 --> 03:21:50,319
So before you spend...

4350
03:21:50,319 --> 03:21:50,719

03:37:49,440 --> 03:37:52,149
No, that would be horrible

4519
03:37:52,149 --> 03:37:54,149
Air bead cushion the wonder watch

4520
03:37:55,600 --> 03:38:00,479
The window vac. All right, what's the window vac?

4521
03:38:04,100 --> 03:38:08,659
It's a gamer shower your windows it's a big problem because dirty windows cloud

4522
03:38:09,379 --> 03:38:16,260
Limit sunlight dirty windows are depressing. Oh, yeah dirty windows make your whole house look and feel filthy

4523
03:38:16,340 --> 03:38:18,340
But you would not have the curtains open

4524
03:38:18,579 --> 03:38:25,860
The dripping the big pile of paper towels the hard work of scrubbing and scrubbing and then there are still streaks and smudges

4525
03:38:26,020 --> 03:38:32,420
Ruining your windows appearance. Shh. You may have a dirty little secret. You don't clean your windows as often as you should

4526
03:38:33,540 --> 03:38:35,540
I hate okay. So what's the product?

4527
03:38:36,020 --> 03:38:41,780
Wouldn't it be great if there was actually a vacuum to clean your windows for you introducing window vac

4528
03:38:42,180 --> 03:38:46,020
The fast and easy way to clean your windows leaving no streaks or spots

03:38:46,340 --> 03:38:50,739
Just spray window vac and walk away your hands never need to get dirty

4530
03:38:50,819 --> 03:38:54,180
Okay, secret is the window vac dual state squeegee cleaning system

4531
03:38:54,340 --> 03:39:00,340
First the professional grade pure rubber pad creates a cleaning suction seal right against the glass as it moves

4532
03:39:00,500 --> 03:39:03,059
Dirt and debris are removed right down to the glass level

4533
03:39:04,180 --> 03:39:09,620
A little dirt solution and dirt are then instantly suctioned away by the powerful on-board water vacuum

4534
03:39:10,020 --> 03:39:16,020
Look, we took a window and baked it in the sun with grease dirt and watch how the dirt is vacuumed off

4535
03:39:16,180 --> 03:39:18,180
House slipper that would be kind of fun

4536
03:39:18,180 --> 03:39:22,739
Just vacuum it up and empty it out in a single and look all the fat and grease

4537
03:39:23,459 --> 03:39:25,459
Just dump it down the drain except don't do that

4538
03:39:26,420 --> 03:39:29,780
Easy take a look at this window. It's filthy, right?

4539
03:39:30,020 --> 03:39:35,459
But no match for window vac just one wife and you're worry free. All right, whatever done with this one

4540
03:39:36,879 --> 03:39:39,120
Uh, what about the uh

4541
03:39:39,120 --> 03:39:45,399
the plumber's hero

4542
03:39:46,069 --> 03:39:48,069
Oh not this thing

4543
03:39:53,649 --> 03:39:56,229
I feel like this would blow up my sink. I would be scared

4544
03:39:56,950 --> 03:40:01,739
Offensive and if there's water on the earth, you can't wait anymore. Just press

4545
03:40:03,340 --> 03:40:05,340
Holy shit, dude, that's so much pressure

4546
03:40:05,340 --> 03:40:08,059
I would feel like I would do that and it would the sink would blow up my face

4547
03:40:09,129 --> 03:40:10,729
That's scary

4548
03:40:10,729 --> 03:40:17,319
A unique formula that when combined uses that water as force to jet propel it through virtually any club

4549
03:40:17,319 --> 03:40:21,850
It's safe. Is that safe with those harmful chemicals that even make you wait upwards

4550
03:40:22,010 --> 03:40:28,010
It even works right through a garbage disposal. Check this clog out veggie shavings rice grease and coffee grounds

4551
03:40:28,329 --> 03:40:30,329
Stop putting that

4552
03:40:39,700 --> 03:40:50,520
Huh hair ties toothpaste shaving gel and hair

4553
03:40:56,889 --> 03:40:58,889
Oh even this old lady

4554
03:41:07,270 --> 03:41:09,270
This is crazy

4555
03:41:12,360 --> 03:41:14,360
Ah shit, we were just about to go out

4556
03:41:15,079 --> 03:41:21,639
Uh, no, wait, hold on honey. You're telling me that like the fucking mondo massive dump I just took before we leave the house

4557
03:41:21,719 --> 03:41:24,440
Oh great now we can't go to the opera

4558
03:41:25,879 --> 03:41:27,879
Oh, no, we can't thank god

4559
03:41:31,510 --> 03:41:49,110
Do they have to make this sound so disgusting too the sound effects are like disgusting point and clean

4560
03:41:51,540 --> 03:41:55,719
I do I could do this all day, but I'm I I could do this all day

4561
03:41:57,819 --> 03:42:11,209
You guys want to do this like once a week. Let's I let's actually do this like once a week

4562
03:42:11,450 --> 03:42:15,379
Let's do this until i'm sick of it. This is funny. I love this

4563
03:42:17,079 --> 03:42:21,299
Okay, we're gonna do i'm gonna do the ultra bulb and then i'm gonna pee and we're gonna

4564
03:42:22,100 --> 03:42:24,100
Your light bulb burned out again

4565
03:42:24,100 --> 03:42:30,579
They don't even make those old light bulbs anymore and those odd shaped led bulbs shine a harsh light in just one

4566
03:42:30,739 --> 03:42:32,739
LEDs are amazing now aren't they?

4567
03:42:32,739 --> 03:42:38,500
Do you buy you need the new ultra bulb led from bell and howl it's the smarter light

4568
03:42:39,209 --> 03:42:42,329
Ultra bulb uses new led technology. So it's an led

4569
03:42:43,370 --> 03:42:48,090
Okay, so it's an led old bulbs did look compact fluorescent bulbs are dim

4570
03:42:48,709 --> 03:42:54,090
Incandescent bulbs always die and most led bulbs shine light in just one direction

4571
03:42:54,489 --> 03:43:00,409
But the new ultra bulb shines a warm bright light evenly and how many okay your original bulb?

4572
03:43:00,649 --> 03:43:06,809
Just look at the difference. That's so bright though. I don't want that bright new 360 degree reflector wrapped with 28 super bright

4573
03:43:07,370 --> 03:43:08,569
technology

4574
03:43:08,569 --> 03:43:15,209
In every direction that would be too bright can last over 10 years without burning out same leds do to reach light bulbs

4575
03:43:15,290 --> 03:43:20,809
It's an led one ultra bulb can replace 25 ordinary bulbs, but not leds because it's an led

4576
03:43:22,090 --> 03:43:24,090
leds last 10 years

4577
03:43:24,569 --> 03:43:27,659
Ultra bulb is always cool to the touch

4578
03:43:27,899 --> 03:43:31,739
It uses eighty five percent less energy than your old light bulb

4579
03:43:31,979 --> 03:43:38,219
Just one ultra bulb can save you a hundred dollars over the life of the bulb and ultra bulb turns on instantly

4580
03:43:38,459 --> 03:43:42,059
No waiting to warm up like those other bulbs. So why is this like a

4581
03:43:42,620 --> 03:43:46,940
Like the freezer room from like a ninety seven eleven. What are you talking about?

4582
03:43:47,420 --> 03:43:52,379
What are they talking about ultra bulb turns on instantly? No waiting to warm up like those other bulbs

4583
03:43:52,540 --> 03:43:55,659
So you don't spend there's a five nights at freddy's like what are you talking about?

4584
03:43:56,059 --> 03:44:00,860
At the home improvement store now you can get two bell and howl ultra bulbs for just

4585
03:44:01,639 --> 03:44:07,819
1999 but only two no, it's gonna be four now and you can double it's four. Of course it is. Yeah, that's four ultra bulb

4586
03:44:08,299 --> 03:44:11,100
This is probably 2004. That's true. That's true

4587
03:44:11,579 --> 03:44:17,659
Won't burn out for 10 years or simply return them and call now to find out about multi-packs at all right

4588
03:44:18,059 --> 03:44:26,219
One more these are so addicting. I can't help it. What's the living bubble?

4589
03:44:29,459 --> 03:44:33,059
Living bubble anyone can hang a picture to decorate a kid's wall

4590
03:44:33,379 --> 03:44:38,020
It takes almost no imagination at all. But when you have an open wall, what else can you do?

4591
03:44:38,420 --> 03:44:40,659
How about trying something completely new?

4592
03:44:41,139 --> 03:44:48,500
It's the living bubble the clear acrylic semi-spare globe that decorates any wall and provides a living space for your child to have their

4593
03:44:48,579 --> 03:44:50,340
Own vet. It's so simple

4594
03:44:50,420 --> 03:44:54,819
It's as easy as hanging a picture on a book and gives your child's room a more decorative

4595
03:44:54,899 --> 03:45:01,059
Look the living bubble makes any room come alive make it a fishbowl and watch their sharks swim and dive

4596
03:45:03,940 --> 03:45:05,940
Even a bowl where plants stay alive

4597
03:45:06,340 --> 03:45:09,719
It's flat in plants. It's on the wall and it's round in the front

4598
03:45:09,719 --> 03:45:15,479
So it holds anything at all living bubble will inspire their creativity and makes any child's room

4599
03:45:15,799 --> 03:45:18,520
Oh fucking no turn that shit off. What the fuck?

4601
03:45:27,370 --> 03:45:29,930

4602
03:45:30,010 --> 03:45:32,569
Dude, whoa

4603
03:45:37,079 --> 03:45:40,840
Don't tap. Yeah, what the fuck? I don't want one of these

4604
03:45:41,780 --> 03:45:44,739
I wouldn't even want one of these for like the plants. I don't know. I think it's weird

4605
03:45:48,170 --> 03:45:50,889
My data hot spot. I don't know about that one

4606
03:45:51,940 --> 03:46:00,420
The soothing shawl the magic mirror. This is uh, this doesn't talk

4607

That makes steam disappear like magic you wipe wipe and wipe and can't see a thing and it makes you late steam

4610
03:46:16,090 --> 03:46:18,090
Can't stick to magic. Whoa. Hold on

4615
03:46:42,969 --> 03:46:44,969

Providing a clear view every time you use it. So it's a second pane of glass

4617
03:46:51,930 --> 03:46:53,930
Nanotechnology there's nanomachines in here
