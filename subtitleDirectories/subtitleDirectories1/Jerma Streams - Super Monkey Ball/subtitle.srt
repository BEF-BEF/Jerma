00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:11,099
Hello, good afternoon everybody. Uh, sorry I'm a little late again today, but Otto seems to be on

2
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:19,510
this, uh, new bathroom schedule, where at 12 o'clock, he's like, I'm, it's, I'm gonna go outside,

3
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:24,469
I have to go outside now. He's like, all right, let's go. So he's, uh, he's been on a different,

4
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:39,140
like, pee and poo schedule. Guess like clockwork. Yeah, actually though, but actually. Do I remember,

5
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:51,219
do I remember what? Wait a minute. The 21st day of September. Of course I do. I get it. Yeah,

6
00:00:51,219 --> 00:01:01,979
yeah, yeah. Oh shit, now I want to listen to that song on repeat for four hours. I do remember,

7
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:12,069
yeah. Do it. I'm not going to do that. That's, that's not good content. That's painful. It's

8
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:18,700
one of the best songs ever made, but that's, nobody wants to hear the same song for the whole

9
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:26,459
stream. It would be horrible. Do it once. I will. We're going to play Super Monkey Ball today. It's

10
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:33,819
been a long time coming. I'm ready. I've been told that this game is very fun. I've been told this

11
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:41,659
game is very hard. Uh, the how to beat has this game at four and a half hours. So you can assume

12
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:48,790
that I'll get stuck on like level four for about four hours. So it's probably going to be like a

13
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:57,260
eight hour experience. Who beats this game? It's first try in four and a half hours. I don't think

14
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:03,420
anybody does that. Sometimes I'll look at like the how to beat. I know it's an average, but then

15
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,020
you'll look at kind of, you go down to the, to the actual menu that shows the times. Like completionists,

16
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:15,620
first timers, right? Can't you see that? How the fuck do people do that? Oh, Dark Souls. Yeah,

17
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:23,340
I beat Dark Souls on my first attempt, my first playthrough in 18 hours. No, you didn't. You walked

18
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,860
around the fucking swamp for four hours at least in like Dark Souls two, Dark Souls three. Who,

19
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:35,270
how do you do that without a guide? I mean, that's normal. That's not normal.

20
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:42,680
Should be playing Super Monkey Ball 2 or Deluxe. I'm really sorry to tell you.

21
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:51,340
This is just Super Monkey Ball for the GameCube. I asked, I made it really clear. I said, hey,

22
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:57,740
what version is like Super Monkey Ball 2, PC, Mac? And everyone screamed at me. They said,

23
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,259
oh, Super Monkey Ball for the Nintendo GameCube. Don't play anything else. And I was like, okay,

24
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:15,349
fine. This is boo. It's not Deluxe. Does it need to be Deluxe? No, fuck Deluxe. I don't want

25
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:20,469
pepperoni, olives, onions, anchovies. I don't want that all over my pizza. Just give me the,

26
00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:30,120
like a pepperoni or like just pepper and onions. I don't want your Deluxe pizza bullshit. That's

27
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,960
too much stuff to put on a pizza. That's too much stuff to put in Super Monkey Ball, the original

28
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:46,069
GameCube version. Let's go. Here we go. Here. Are you watching? Are you ready? Which says you're

29
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:57,289
playing the one for Vita? What? Okay. Okay. I looked over here and I see that stream preview.

30
00:03:57,289 --> 00:04:04,060
I see a game called Hamster Ball. I was like, wait, that's not this. Is that the Vita? No,

31
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:12,860
that's my title. It's Super Monkey Ball, not from PS Vita. Super Monkey Ball Banana Splits.

32
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:26,069
Shit. Super Monkey Ball. There it is. All right. Refresh. Well, I, okay, I don't want it to be

33
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:34,120
Banana Splits. How do I make it just the regular one? What the flying fuck is all this?

34
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,519
Super Monkey Ball 2, Super Monkey Ball Ticket Blitz, Super Monkey Ball, Super Monkey Ball 2,

35
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:42,680
Sakura Edition, Super Monkey Ball Adventure, Super Monkey Ball Deluxe, Super Monkey Ball Banana

36
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,319
Blitz HD, Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz Splits, Super Monkey Ball 3D, Super Monkey Ball Step and

37
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:53,740
Roll, Monkey Ball Junior, Monkey Ball Banana Blitz. How many games do they have? I thought

38
00:04:53,740 --> 00:05:03,779
there was two. Super Monkey Ball. I just, okay, it should be, I just clicked Super Monkey Ball,

39
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:13,430
but it's just, it won't, it'll only do Banana Splits. Why I wanted, what's going on here? Why

40
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:22,230
is it doing that? I select Super Monkey Ball and it goes Banana Splits. Is it fixed? Who cares? Let's

41
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:28,660
go. It don't matter. If you see Super Monkey Ball in the title, just know that it's one of the

42
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:39,670
apparently 15 fucking Jason movies this game has. Let's go. Super Monkey Ball.

43
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,480
Main game, party game, mini game, main game, right? Make sure to guide the monkeys in the balls to

44
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:57,990
the goal as quickly as possible. There's no sound. Oops. We're good. I just played the game

45
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:05,959
completely with no audio. Okay. Main game. Yeah. Main game. Normal practice or competition.

46
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:12,870
All right. So let's do normal. This is definitely a Sega game. I can already tell. It is, right?

47
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:19,540
It's a Sega game. That's the Sega guy that talks after you touch stuff on one player.

48
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:28,660
Okay. I, I, me, me, baby, or gone, gone. Okay. I think it's going to have to be baby.

49
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:44,250
I, I, or it's going to be baby. It has to be. But do they have powers? B add X. Beginner 10 stage,

50
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:51,930
advanced 30 straight, expert 50 stages. Let's do beginner first. What? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

51
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:58,660
I have a question. Is this like Mario party where it's just adding more stages on top

52
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:05,800
or do the other completely different stages? So I got to go through beginner first.

53
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:11,540
They're all different. They're all different. They're all. All right. Let's go. I'm ready.

54
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:24,889
So there are fucking like a hundred stages. Oh, well, this looks easy. Ready? Go. All right.

55
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:35,829
That's fun. So it's like, it's okay. But it saves the replays. Bananas, three out of a hundred.

56
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:44,759
You just got to collect the bananas. Do I have that actual time limit or no?

57
00:07:45,319 --> 00:08:01,480
Yeah, I do. It's right there. Oh, my like audio is so fucked up. Watch the replay for a second.

58
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:17,019
Hey, I got to get new. Okay. I swear to God. Go. Where is it? Oh, sick. This is cool. Yeah. All

59
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:27,370
right. This is like playing Sonic, but you actually get to watch rather than go. Did I make it?

60
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:41,960
Is there a jump? How do I jump? Oh, so there's no camera either. It's just whatever way you're

61
00:08:41,960 --> 00:09:09,899
going to go. All right. Okay. I got 40 seconds of plenty of time. Oh, shit. You go fast. You'll

62
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:17,480
bounce. Oh, it has a miles per hour. That's cool. Bonus floor. Collect all the bananas. All right.

63
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:32,409
Okay. I got time. That's why this is beginner. I get it. Shit. I'm doing such a bad job mowing

64
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:44,100
the banana lawn. I can do better than this. They'll have dole on them. Wait a minute.

65
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:59,480
Is this a sponsored video game? Dole bananas. All right. I got them now. Oh, partially. Yes.

66
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,000
Oh, no. This looks like it's a little more complicated. Okay. So this one is,

67
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:10,600
how fast should I be going? You got to take corners tight.

68
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:20,580
Okay. This game's fun. I like this game very much. It's okay. It's all right. It's fine. It's fine.

69
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:35,500
It's going to happen at least once. Wait, do I have lives? Wait, when I run out of lives,

70
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:47,929
do I run out of lives? Yes. But you know what I mean? Do I have to start over? You do. Wait.

71
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:59,159
Oh, I missed one. No, I can't get it. I hate it. I hate that. I hate it. I have to get it.

72
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:13,769
Whatever. That sucks. You can continue. Okay. That's good. Shit. Can I go back and play that

73
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:20,379
one again? All right. How many bananas are here? What happens when I get 100 bananas?

74
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:38,149
Did I miss some back here? Get these. There we go. Okay. I got to make this cleaner.

75
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:53,539
No wonder I'm going to fucking throw up. Oh, that's a bunch. You definitely will need those lives.

76
00:11:53,539 --> 00:12:11,960
Okay. I'm going the goal yet. Get it perfect. Perfect. Missed one. I'm good. Or eight. All

77
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:28,259
right. We only have two more floors. Oh, this is bad. Okay. Let's do it slow. No. I don't know

78
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:32,600
what I was thinking. I don't know what I was thinking. I thought I could go. I don't know.

79
00:12:38,100 --> 00:13:00,980
Holy shit. No, this is hard. I'm okay. It isn't. Yes, it is. All right. I'm going to wait.

80
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:10,259
Poor baby monkey. You are on the dole. What? What do you mean I'm on the dole? What does that mean?

81
00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:21,100
Can I go? I'm not going to go. I'm not going to go. I'm going to wait.

82
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,460
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

83
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:42,759
Rolling. Stop. Rolling. Stop. Rolling. Don't. 15 seconds. I know I'm going. It isn't just for lives.

84
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:54,259
Yeah, but you have to get them. Okay. Floor nine. This one looks cool. This one just dumps you down

85
00:13:54,259 --> 00:14:10,279
there. All right. Don't go that fast. What? You have received 228 play points. You now have a

86
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,279
I have a total of 228 play points.

87
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:14,649
I'm gonna go again.

88
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:21,179
What do you mean sad? Why is that sad?

89
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:23,179
I'm just my first time

90
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:25,179
playing Super Monkey Ball 3D.

91
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:29,720
Are you fucking kidding me?

92
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:37,960
This isn't 2D.

93
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,960
How did I fuck that up? I don't even know. I don't know how I messed that up.

94
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:51,929
I don't know.

95
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:55,450
Oh my fucking god.

96
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,620
Why? I need some coffee.

97
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,620
I gotta get coffee. Let me drink some coffee

98
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:04,360
for a second. Just wait.

99
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:16,779
Okay. Get some good cider.

100
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:20,409
Stop.

101
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:24,820
Let's line it up.

102
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:31,590
I took way longer than it should have.

103
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,590
This is it. Final floor of Beginner.

104
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,590
This is to teach you how to play.

105
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:42,250
Oh. Thank god there's

106
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:47,049
bumpers. I wish I could turn

107
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:52,299
the camera just a little. I think I'll be

108
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:55,179
fine on this one. I'm not gonna fall.

109
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:59,210
This one has divots.

110
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,210
My chair was just shaking too at the same time.

111
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:06,970
I was just rolling down the

112
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:11,700
stairs in my chair.

113
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:17,080
Oh god damn it.

114
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,879
It says no. I can't even fucking do it.

115
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:30,460
Don't say hurry up.

116
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,460
Don't listen to them. Just go normally. Do normal.

117
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:41,929
Normal. I'm fine.

118
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:44,230
Alright. I got here with 30

119
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,230
seconds the last time. I got plenty more time.

120
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:53,509
Alright. Line this up. Don't be a fucking

121
00:16:53,509 --> 00:17:01,379
idiot.

122
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:04,390
This is hard.

123
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,390
This is very tricky. It's tricky.

124
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,400
Okay. Do you guys know that game

125
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
where you have the marble in that little plastic

126
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,400
device and you have to tilt it around and put it

127
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
inside of the hole in the middle of the little device?

128
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,700
I was never any good at that. I always

129
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,700
freaked the fuck out. I always went over

130
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,700
it. Went over it. Went over it.

131
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,700
Went too hard. Went too hard. Went too hard. Went too soft.

132
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,700
And then I would just throw the thing in the trash.

133
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,259
Like who even cares?

134
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:40,170
That's not gonna impress anybody.

135
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,170
All that does is just take some

136
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:48,380
annoying time to get that right.

137
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,380
If you show somebody you do that they just go oh yeah

138
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,380
I also one day was

139
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,380
a fucking asshole and spent

140
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,380
45 minutes trying to get a ball in the middle of a hole.

141
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:14,599
He hates this.

142
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:17,740
You know what's funny?

143
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,740
When I was just being annoyed

144
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,740
I almost did the whole thing in one go.

145
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,740
I can't focus.

146
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,740
I don't want to focus on this.

147
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,740
Games like this if I don't focus I do better.

148
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,740
Give me a talk. Somebody give me a topic.

149
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,740
Right now. Give me a topic.

150
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:40,359
Oranges.

151
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:43,430
No oranges are gross.

152
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:46,700
I'm one of those people that thinks that oranges are gross.

153
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,700
I actually like clementines though.

154
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,700
Clementines are exactly what you want.

155
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,700
You want just a little bit of orange.

156
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,700
They don't get slimy. They don't have that weird white

157
00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:00,069
film on them.

158
00:19:00,069 --> 00:19:02,069
You can peel them so easily.

159
00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:04,069
Alright. Didn't work.

160
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:06,069
It didn't work. It didn't work.

161
00:19:06,069 --> 00:19:08,069
Just relax. I'm gonna get it right now.

162
00:19:08,069 --> 00:19:20,099
This is beginner. Great.

163
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:22,099
I'm gonna be good.

164
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:24,599
How long has it been? 20 minutes?

165
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:27,609
That's like a good

166
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:29,609
meaty stream right? 20 minutes?

167
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:34,089
How long is this

168
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,089
Joe Rogan podcast? 40 minutes?

169
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:41,849
Alright. I'm good.

170
00:19:41,849 --> 00:20:06,089
My computer just crashed. I'm good.

171
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:08,089
That was really weird. My computer just hard

172
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:10,089
crashed. Like it was hanging.

173
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:16,170
Exposed. What do you mean exposed? I only got

174
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:19,559
14 seconds!

175
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,559
Hey! You guys have clementines. I like how you can peel

176
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,559
them with your hands. They're much much

177
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:25,559
softer than a regular orange.

178
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,559
If you agree with me give me a fucking retweet!

179
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:41,579
Yes! It really is an ad.

180
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:45,289
You got 100 points altogether. You have

181
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:48,619
357 points.

182
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:50,619
Only 2143

183
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:52,619
points left to unlock

184
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,619
the next

185
00:20:54,619 --> 00:21:01,720
game. Remember when people

186
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,720
used to try to pay me to talk like that?

187
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,339
I just did that for free.

188
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:14,140
What's this? Oh

189
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:22,579
this is cool. It's like Sonic

190
00:21:22,579 --> 00:21:24,579
if you touch anything you lose them?

191
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:32,390
Okay so nobody can say I didn't beat Super

192
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,390
Monkey Ball. We're not talking about

193
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,950
difficulty. We're just talking about completion.

194
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:43,289
None of you can say I didn't do it. Super

195
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:46,299
Monkey Ball. I can't believe there

196
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:48,299
are this many. I really can't.

197
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:50,660
I was always under the assumption that there was two.

198
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,160
That there was one for the GameCube

199
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,160
and then one for the iPad that

200
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,720
nobody liked. Or Dreamcast.

201
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,900
I always thought that Dreamcast

202
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,900
came out with one and then they came out with one like a remake

203
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:13,289
for the GameCube. What's your high

204
00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:16,220
score here? Huh?

205
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:23,380
What's your high score here huh? The iPad

206
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:32,920
fucking sucks. Alright can I skip this?

207
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,920
I know everyone's gonna be mad if I do. But can

208
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:43,240
I? Just quit back to menu.

209
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,240
Well let me just say how much I can get on my first run.

210
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,619
Skip it! I

211
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:55,220
can't! There's no skipping!

212
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:00,539
It's a forced cut scene

213
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:05,210
guys. I can't skip it.

214
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:12,440
We're almost done. Look in the

215
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:17,180
credits. You're losing bananas.

216
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:21,339
Alright how about this? Whatever

217
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:23,339
I have for a total banana count at the end is how many

218
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:27,180
community subs I will give.

219
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:38,950
How's that sound? That sounds good to me.

220
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:48,619
I hope we're

221
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:50,619
not near the end of the

222
00:23:50,619 --> 00:24:02,069
credits. How much of roll

223
00:24:02,069 --> 00:24:04,380
is over now?

224
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,380
How many do I have to...oh so far?

225
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,380
Oh shit!

226
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,740
Huh fuck! I'm hitting

227
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:17,400
things. Oops!

228
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,400
Oh don't

229
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,789
crap!

230
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:29,259
No! I really don't.

231
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,259
Hold on. I don't want to give

232
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:33,259
like...wait wait wait what does that

233
00:24:33,259 --> 00:24:35,259
mean? What does that mean? What does that mean?

234
00:24:35,259 --> 00:24:37,259
Minus...wait that's how many subs I

235
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:41,420
get now. No no no

236
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,420
no no no no. You're gonna twist that on me somehow.

237
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,869
You twist that on me. I gotta get it to

238
00:24:46,869 --> 00:24:50,970
zero. You guys are gonna twist it.

239
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,400
They'll be like, no no dude because you went negative

240
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,400
now it's like you've minus...you have to

241
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,400
like deduct those subs into our count.

242
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:02,390
Let's just stay at fucking zero.

243
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:07,900
Let's go to

244
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,420
minus two.

245
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,589
Come on

246
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:15,589
perfectly balanced is how things should be.

247
00:25:15,589 --> 00:25:20,259
Shit I'm really not trying to hit this

248
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:24,299
thing. I'm really trying to get it to...

249
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:27,109
Oh no. No it doesn't

250
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,109
go the other way. I didn't make that. I gotta make

251
00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:32,250
that really clear. Let's be very

252
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,619
clear here. No it doesn't

253
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:36,619
matter if it goes negative. It doesn't mean anything.

254
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:43,140
No I don't wanna.

255
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,960
I don't wanna. There's the goal.

256
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,960
Alright come on. Perfectly balanced is how things should be.

257
00:25:47,960 --> 00:26:00,059
Okay.

258
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:04,220
Oh wait. Fuck you.

259
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:11,000
No. That doesn't mean anything.

260
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
That's one two three.

261
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,180
I went minus one two three.

262
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:19,720
I was just trying to get to

263
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,720
dash one two three.

264
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,720
That's not one hundred and twenty three.

265
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,720
Unsub. Oh shit.

266
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,299
One hundred and twenty three of you guys have to

267
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:35,900
unsub. That's not good.

268
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,900
No no. Whoa whoa whoa. Hold on. Wait. Don't do...

269
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,900
Don't get too hasty

270
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,900
here because what's gonna happen is like

271
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,900
okay if I say press one

272
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,900
in the chat. Hey ten of you press one in the chat.

273
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,900
Two thousand of you are gonna press one in the chat.

274
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,900
If I say oh a hundred of you

275
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,900
need to unsub. Five

276
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,900
thousand of you are gonna unsub.

277
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,519
Let's not get

278
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:58,519
too hasty there. Don't get too hasty

279
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:05,109
there. What does this want me to do?

280
00:27:05,109 --> 00:27:13,670
Oh.

281
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:16,039
I don't care. Enter your name.

282
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:19,670
That's my name.

283
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:25,420
Hi. Everybody

284
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:29,380
unsub. If you don't unsub

285
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,380
you're encouraging bad behavior.

286
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,380
Don't do that. You're going

287
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,380
over it. You are messing with

288
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,519
things that you are not to mess with.

289
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:40,519
What's like the villain say

290
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:42,519
in the movie when things are too powerful?

291
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:44,519
You're messing with forces that you do not know.

292
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:56,359
Something like that right?

293
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:58,359
Alright. Should we stay with...

294
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:01,690
Let's go Mimi. We'll do advanced.

295
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:08,660
I thought you guys said that it wasn't

296
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,660
just packed on levels.

297
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:20,390
Wait. Did somebody just gave a hundred subs?

298
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,390
Wait. Hold on. Somebody...

299
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:25,019
ZombieEater just gave a hundred community subs.

300
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:32,440
That's a lot. That's a shit

301
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,440
low sub. Thank you for the hundred subs.

302
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,450
Okay. Now those

303
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,450
hundred people delete them. Like just take

304
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,750
off your sub. Right after getting it.

305
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,750
Don't do that though.

306
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,180
Money. You know what I mean? Money.

307
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:49,640
Mini golf course.

308
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,099
Okay. A hundred

309
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:55,099
from...hold on.

310
00:28:55,099 --> 00:28:57,099
A hundred from ZombieEater and

311
00:28:57,099 --> 00:28:59,099
twenty-three from FireLactors. You guys are fucking crazy.

312
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:03,829
Thank you both of you. That's

313
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:05,829
an extreme amount of money.

314
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:15,930
How did I not get those? Got it.

315
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:20,859
Okay. Good. Quickly. Quickly. Quickly.

316
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,859
Quickly. Quickly. Quickly. Quickly.

317
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:26,809
I didn't even know that's what they did.

318
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:30,200
I don't know the game mechanic.

319
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,700
And by the way. Stupid game

320
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,599
mechanic by the way.

321
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:38,599
That wasn't me. That was the game mechanics.

322
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:50,630
Bad because bad. Mad because bad.

323
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,630
But no seriously. That's fucking hundreds of dollars guys.

324
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,630
We joke around. But that's a lot of money.

325
00:29:54,630 --> 00:30:08,309
Thank you.

326
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:12,339
Just moving my rubber duckies around.

327
00:30:12,339 --> 00:30:14,339
I'm the number one streamer that streams in a bathtub.

328
00:30:14,339 --> 00:30:18,819
Oh shit.

329
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:29,450
Okay. That's not what I wanted.

330
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:32,009
I don't care about bananas. I care about completion.

331
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:34,819
I didn't get any. But I don't care.

332
00:30:34,819 --> 00:30:36,819
Do you care? Do you actually

333
00:30:36,819 --> 00:30:40,539
care? I don't. I care about completion.

334
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:49,299
I'm just holding up.

335
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:56,970
Didn't move fast enough. Nevermind.

336
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,970
You received 69 playpoints. You now have

337
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,970
a total of 426

338
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:04,940
playpoints. What are the party

339
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,940
games you can unlock? That seems kind of fun.

340
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:10,710
Alright. I'm going to wait and go now.

341
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:16,539
This one's going to be tricky. Okay.

342
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:18,839
This one's going to take me a while. Just a

343
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:27,990
minute. It's going to be like five minutes.

344
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:39,430
Come on. Hurry up. Go back.

345
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:44,549
Can I do this in one go?

346
00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:57,220
I can. Imagine

347
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,220
there being a casino minigame.

348
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,779
Is that your way to tell me that there's a casino

349
00:32:01,779 --> 00:32:05,619
minigame in this? Is that the way

350
00:32:05,619 --> 00:32:09,980
you're going to let me know? Do I get to bet

351
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,980
my dull bananas?

352
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:17,019
Like a slot machine?

353
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:19,019
I see. Okay. I'm seeing the grins.

354
00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:24,970
This is the most inefficient way to fucking

355
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:26,970
do this level. It's unbelievable.

356
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:37,000
I almost didn't make it either. Each

357
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,500
time you fall, you

358
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,779
what? I want to spoil it. I'll get them all

359
00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:55,880
here. Spiral. Just do a spiral.

360
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,440
I don't have enough time.

361
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:21,990
Sorry. I had to let all the air out of my body for

362
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:31,339
a second. Okay. Good to know.

363
00:33:31,339 --> 00:33:39,269
You got to wait. You know what? I think

364
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:41,269
I have to go around the whole thing, right?

365
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:44,980
You got to wrap around.

366
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:48,759
What happened? I won?

367
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:53,609
Oh. I'll take it.

368
00:33:53,609 --> 00:33:55,609
Oh shit. This is a silly straw. I don't like

369
00:33:55,609 --> 00:33:58,549
this one. Oh, let me tell you guys

370
00:33:58,549 --> 00:34:00,549
something real quick. I bought this elaborate

371
00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:02,549
silly straw glasses thing where

372
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:04,549
it was a big straw that wrapped around my whole

373
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:06,549
body and went up around my eyes as

374
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:08,550
glasses. And I was going to turn it on

375
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,550
and drink stuff out of it.

376
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,550
I think it was funny.

377
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,550
I snapped it in half accidentally because it was so brittle.

378
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,789
I was setting up to do it.

379
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:18,789
I was putting it all around my body and shit.

380
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:21,929
And what's wrong

381
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:26,730
with my computer? I like need

382
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:29,480
a new computer. My like

383
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,360
Windows is crashing. What the

384
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:51,289
fuck is happening? Shit.

385
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,460
Why? He's getting

386
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,460
hacked. I'm not getting hacked.

387
00:34:55,460 --> 00:35:07,739
What happened? Oh fuck.

388
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:10,679
That's not good. That's

389
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:13,690
not good. That's not good.

390
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:19,449
I swear to God every time I download a

391
00:35:19,449 --> 00:35:21,449
Windows update, my computer gets

392
00:35:21,449 --> 00:35:23,449
worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.

393
00:35:23,449 --> 00:35:25,449
It's like I'm taking my car to the mechanic

394
00:35:25,449 --> 00:35:28,199
and every time

395
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:30,199
I go to the mechanic, he unscrews

396
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:36,730
something else.

397
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,730
Hey, man, can you replace my

398
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,730
windshield wiper fluid? Yeah, I sure can.

399
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,730
And he puts

400
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:44,730
like a little bit of windshield wiper fluid in and

401
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,730
unscrews something underneath.

402
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,730
And then I come in to ask him, hey, I'm hearing like a rattling.

403
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,730
Let me check that out. And he opens it up

404
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,730
and just fucking, he just like pees in

405
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:55,099
the gas tank or something.

406
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:57,099
My gas tank smells like pee. Yeah.

407
00:35:57,099 --> 00:35:59,340
Let me fix that.

408
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:02,980
And he pees in the wiper fluid.

409
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:06,500
He takes a hammer to like the tail light.

410
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,500
Like every time I get a Windows update, my computer

411
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,579
gets worse. My computer just

412
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:13,579
gets worse every time I download one.

413
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:15,579
And there's been a bunch of them lately. Like I caught

414
00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:22,809
up. I caught up.

415
00:36:22,809 --> 00:36:24,809
Okay, let's go. I'm ready.

416
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:34,730
Gotta love those monkey balls.

417
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:43,110
Yeah. Hey, what's the

418
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,480
like I'm asking because like a

419
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,480
friend of mine asked me one day like

420
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,480
yesterday, he said, hey, dude, what's the button

421
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,480
combination if you have

422
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,480
like a computer and you

423
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,480
have a program on your computer that emulates

424
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,170
video games? He's like, hey,

425
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:00,170
what's a button combination to save a state?

426
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,170
And I was like, I don't fucking know.

427
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,170
Leave me alone.

428
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:08,070
I was like, why would I know that? Leave me, shut up, dude.

429
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:14,920
Alt F4. Yes.

430
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,920
Yes, I did. Yeah, I know.

431
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,920
I just learned what a computer was yesterday.

432
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,739
What emulator is it? I don't

433
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:25,190
know.

434
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,190
Sea bass or something. It's some kind of sea

435
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:31,800
animal. He's like, yeah,

436
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,800
uh, fucking like swordfish like

437
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,800
2.1 or I don't know what the fuck

438
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,800
that is, dude. Get out of here. Get the fuck out of my house.

439
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,130
What would it like

440
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:52,900
if you asked, what could I tell him?

441
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,659
Shift F1.

442
00:37:55,659 --> 00:37:57,659
But like make sure it's like right though because like this guy

443
00:37:59,659 --> 00:38:01,659
This guy's really like powerful and I don't want to make

444
00:38:01,659 --> 00:38:03,659
him like mad. What if he gets angry?

445
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:12,019
Report him.

446
00:38:12,019 --> 00:38:18,420
Shift F12. Stop

447
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,820
it. Okay. Okay. That was Arnold

448
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,820
Schwarzenegger exact cadence.

449
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,250
But not doing Arnold

450
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:32,519
Schwarzenegger's voice. It's like somebody

451
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:34,519
pitch shifted Arnold saying that like

452
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:54,869
stop it. All right.

453
00:38:54,869 --> 00:39:03,880
I gotta pay attention. Yep.

454
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,880
What's the shift F12?

455
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,699
You better not be lying to me. You better not be lying to

456
00:39:08,699 --> 00:39:17,019
my friend Dave. Don't listen.

457
00:39:17,019 --> 00:39:19,019
It's Alt F5. It's not

458
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:21,019
Alt F5. That would be stupid.

459
00:39:21,019 --> 00:39:23,019
That's close your computer's

460
00:39:23,019 --> 00:39:25,260
desktop. Shift F1.

461
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,260
You know what? I'm going to look it up for Dave.

462
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,260
He needs me. I'm going to look it up over here.

463
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:32,710
I don't trust anybody.

464
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:35,019
Dave's pissed. Dave's like a

465
00:39:35,019 --> 00:39:37,019
wicked powerful senator.

466
00:39:37,019 --> 00:39:40,070
I get this wrong.

467
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:42,070
Like introduce a bill to remove my fucking

468
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:45,079
stream. Oh no. I'm dead.

469
00:39:45,079 --> 00:40:06,179
148

470
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:09,510
play point. Okay.

471
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,750
Yeah. You guys are right. It's

472
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:14,699
Yeah.

473
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:16,699
I got it tested for him.

474
00:40:16,699 --> 00:40:18,699
I want to make sure it was correct.

475
00:40:18,699 --> 00:40:25,610
Go in the goal.

476
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:32,900
Good link.

477
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,210
I did

478
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:37,210
a hee hee. I went a hee hee.

479
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:40,019
I never hee hee on this stream.

480
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:42,019
Okay. I'm not going to fucking

481
00:40:42,019 --> 00:40:48,940
Why is this one messing me up so much?

482
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:56,230
What is load save state?

483
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,230
Oh my god Jeremy.

484
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,469
Fucking just go in the goal.

485
00:41:00,469 --> 00:41:13,260
F3.

486
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,260
Just F1 is load. How's it?

487
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:25,739
Hey like that. Tried.

488
00:41:25,739 --> 00:41:27,739
I tried. I tried. I tried. I tried.

489
00:41:27,739 --> 00:41:30,230
I was going for the Super Mario skip.

490
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:35,739
Click the link. Hold on.

491
00:41:35,739 --> 00:41:38,940
I'm busy. I can't just click

492
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,940
any link that pops up in the chat. I have to play

493
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,940
Super Monkey Ball HD remake.

494
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:46,260
I was speaking to HD remakes. Holy

495
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,260
shit. Demon's Souls looks insane.

496
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:52,170
Demon's Souls looks so

497
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:54,170
completely different that

498
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:56,170
it's like it's going to be

499
00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:00,010
like playing a whole new video game.

500
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:02,010
Even though I've already played through it within the last

501
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:04,010
couple of years. What? Last two or three years or so.

502
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:06,010
It don't matter.

503
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:08,630
It's going to be like Dark Souls 4.

504
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:18,280
I really thought I was going to get that one.

505
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,219
Yeah. This game is fun as hell.

506
00:42:21,219 --> 00:42:23,219
I'll click the link. Hold on. Just give me a second.

507
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:32,099
What is it? The Chuck E. Cheese

508
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:37,989
thing. Yeah. I saw this.

509
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:39,989
Charles Entertainment Cheese.

510
00:42:39,989 --> 00:42:46,650
But it's not. Where is it?

511
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:54,500
It's kind of scary.

512
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,769
It's huge.

513
00:42:57,769 --> 00:43:05,260
It's too big.

514
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:11,460
Oh. Go smaller.

515
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:15,429
There we are.

516
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:22,219
Chucks VFF.

517
00:43:22,219 --> 00:43:27,340
Too big. Too big.

518
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,340
That's pretty cool. Yeah.

519
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,340
That's a cool image that somebody

520
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,510
has made of me. That's not

521
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:38,949
me.

522
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,949
You know that guy Dave we

523
00:43:40,949 --> 00:43:42,949
talked about? The powerful senator from fucking

524
00:43:42,949 --> 00:43:44,949
I don't know. Whatever state.

525
00:43:44,949 --> 00:43:46,949
He also said that he was having like graphical problems

526
00:43:46,949 --> 00:43:48,949
in his game.

527
00:43:48,949 --> 00:43:50,949
He's texting me right now.

528
00:43:50,949 --> 00:43:52,949
He's spamming me. And he's saying hey

529
00:43:52,949 --> 00:43:54,949
what the fuck dude. I started

530
00:43:54,949 --> 00:43:56,949
saving my state but then my graphics are all messed up.

531
00:43:56,949 --> 00:43:58,949
Fix it or your stream is over.

532
00:43:58,949 --> 00:44:02,280
I was like dude

533
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,280
I'm working on it.

534
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,280
So what should I do if that happens to Dave's computer?

535
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:15,820
Tell him to stop breaking

536
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,820
the law.

537
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,820
Hey fellas.

538
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,820
This guy

539
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,820
wanted me to tell a senator

540
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,820
to stop breaking or bending the law.

541
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:27,989
Can you believe

542
00:44:27,989 --> 00:44:41,500
this guy? I hate

543
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:46,280
these ones. I hate these ones.

544
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:50,250
These ones are too hard for me. This is on advanced.

545
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:54,090
I think I can still pull it off.

546
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:56,090
Well hold on. Let me see. What's going on with my voice?

547
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:59,929
Why am I turning into this?

548
00:44:59,929 --> 00:45:01,929
I don't know why I'm like this now.

549
00:45:01,929 --> 00:45:05,960
I'm just going to beat the level because I don't care.

550
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,590
Fuck the bananas. Fuck the

551
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:11,590
bananas. Nobody cares about bananas anyways.

552
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:13,590
They're radioactive don't you know?

553
00:45:23,699 --> 00:45:26,010
This is water. Okay that's going to hurt my head if I continue

554
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:31,510
to look at that. Hey

555
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:33,510
we're getting text.

556
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:38,309
Hey Jeremy I got

557
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:40,309
really, my aspect ratio

558
00:45:40,309 --> 00:45:42,309
in Swordfish

559
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:44,309
1-2 is going

560
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:46,739
crazy. Fix it.

561
00:45:46,739 --> 00:45:48,739
Okay I think force 4 by 3.

562
00:45:48,739 --> 00:45:50,739
I think that will help if you do, if you open up that program.

563
00:45:50,739 --> 00:45:52,739
Alright I'll try.

564
00:45:52,739 --> 00:46:00,099
You little fuck.

565
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:02,099
I think I'm just at this guy's mercy every day?

566
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:06,889
Jeremy, is it

567
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:09,190
still safe to drink almond

568
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:11,190
milk if it's two days after it's expiration?

569
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:13,190
You better fucking tell me.

570
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:19,639
How do I end? Oh it's

571
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:30,059
okay. I'm just like

572
00:46:30,059 --> 00:46:35,429
yeah

573
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:37,670
we're

574
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,550
unstoppable now. Oh

575
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:50,730
fuck this level. What is this

576
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:52,730
point 1, point 2, point 4?

577
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:55,739
Point 4.

578
00:46:55,739 --> 00:46:58,420
Just hold forward. Oh

579
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:02,579
that didn't work. That's the thickness?

580
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:05,530
Oh let's go with the fucking

581
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:10,010
hardest one there is.

582
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:12,010
You get more bananas. Oh sick.

583
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:14,010
It's going to even get

584
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:21,989
I failed the test.

585
00:47:21,989 --> 00:47:23,989
This is fun. Okay I like this. I'm going to stay here

586
00:47:23,989 --> 00:47:25,989
for a little bit. Line it up.

587
00:47:25,989 --> 00:47:32,329
It's impossible. It's not possible.

588
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:40,630
You have to go fast.

589
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:48,570
How would you go fast over this? Really?

590
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:52,659
I have to go fast? No.

591
00:47:52,659 --> 00:48:05,340
I can't do it.

592
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,340
I don't think it's possible. I don't think it's possible to do this.

593
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,510
I also have to go straight.

594
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:12,329
Yeah I also have to go

595
00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:14,329
straight. That's right. You're right.

596
00:48:14,329 --> 00:48:19,369
Just balance.

597
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:21,369
Pepe laugh. I can't. I need

598
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:25,210
the upgrade. Just go forward.

599
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:30,139
Look at all those bananas too.

600
00:48:30,139 --> 00:48:42,940
This is awesome. What the fuck

601
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:58,619
is going on? Just do the easy

602
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:00,619
one. I'll do point one.

603
00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:04,139
You can't even go on them.

604
00:49:04,139 --> 00:49:06,139
They're covered in oil.

605
00:49:06,139 --> 00:49:15,289
Just do the easiest one.

606
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:17,289
No I can't do blue.

607
00:49:17,289 --> 00:49:23,050
I'll do green. I'm never going to

608
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:25,050
get out of this. I'm never going to be able to do this.

609
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:36,820
I won't be able to.

610
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:39,449
Alright I'll do teal. That's my German 985

611
00:49:39,449 --> 00:49:45,019
colors. That's fine.

612
00:49:45,019 --> 00:49:48,409
What? Wait wait wait wait.

613
00:49:48,409 --> 00:49:50,409
Is this the end?

614
00:49:50,409 --> 00:49:56,789
Shit. Game over.

615
00:49:56,789 --> 00:50:00,380
What do you mean game over?

616
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:21,429
Save state. No.

617
00:50:21,429 --> 00:50:23,860
Save state. Give me a fucking break guys.

618
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:25,860
You think I'm some kind of asshole?

619
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:27,860
No I have six game cubes lined up here.

620
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:30,170
All at the same level.

621
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:32,170
Lined up in different parts of the game in case

622
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:34,789
I get stuck. I have

623
00:50:34,789 --> 00:50:36,789
physical hardware save states.

624
00:50:36,789 --> 00:50:51,750
Is that okay?

625
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:54,440
Don't fall off the easiest one.

626
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:58,280
Okay good. Blue.

627
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,280
LL. Fuck you're right. I'm going to do it right.

628
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:09,880
Oh my god I can't even.

629
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:14,099
What the hell is going on?

630
00:51:14,099 --> 00:51:17,239
Fell off. I didn't fall off the easiest one.

631
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:19,239
I deliberately fell off the easiest one.

632
00:51:19,239 --> 00:51:21,670
My fingers are like sweating and cold and shit.

633
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:29,289
My hands are sweating

634
00:51:29,289 --> 00:51:33,829
and cold.

635
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:35,829
How? Why does that happen to me?

636
00:51:35,829 --> 00:51:39,219
How can you be sweating and cold

637
00:51:39,219 --> 00:51:41,219
on your fucking hands?

638
00:51:41,219 --> 00:51:45,510
Rage already. No. Why would I?

639
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:47,510
I mean

640
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:49,510
of course I'm getting a little frustrating

641
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:53,219
to play.

642
00:51:53,219 --> 00:51:55,219
I didn't do the easiest one.

643
00:51:55,219 --> 00:52:05,699
That's all I care about.

644
00:52:05,699 --> 00:52:12,539
Oh look at this one.

645
00:52:12,539 --> 00:52:14,539
Don't forget the hardware save state.

646
00:52:14,539 --> 00:52:19,269
Oh this is awesome. I love this one.

647
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:24,139
It's not even hard. It's

648
00:52:24,139 --> 00:52:39,670
fun. Come on dude.

649
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:41,670
Multiple Dave states.

650
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:45,320
Senator Dave state.

651
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,320
Senator Dave state.

652
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:54,869
He's a statesman. Holy shit. Okay.

653
00:52:54,869 --> 00:53:04,090
Game sucks. Game sucks.

654
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:19,900
Game sucks.

655
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,900
Hates the game. No actually I really like it.

656
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:29,460
Imagine how much of a pain in the ass that would be.

657
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:31,460
You'd have to plug in different audio video cables

658
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:33,460
and a different HDMI source.

659
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:38,139
Here we go.

660
00:53:38,139 --> 00:53:47,909
Oh there was one over there at the end.

661
00:53:47,909 --> 00:53:49,909
What was halfway through advanced?

662
00:53:49,909 --> 00:54:05,190
Do these move?

663
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:11,719
How do you not get that banana?

664
00:54:11,719 --> 00:54:14,539
Dave states Davegate.

665
00:54:14,539 --> 00:54:18,949
Davegate. I understand how this

666
00:54:18,949 --> 00:54:20,949
works but my brain is having trouble still.

667
00:54:20,949 --> 00:54:25,750
It's going with the moving

668
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:27,750
of the game board.

669
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:29,750
I don't care. Go in.

670
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:37,239
That time bonus is

671
00:54:37,239 --> 00:54:44,840
trending.

672
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,840
Do you think I have that much influence that I could get something trending on Twitter?

673
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:50,599
No.

674
00:54:50,599 --> 00:54:52,599
It would take like

675
00:54:52,599 --> 00:54:54,599
50 times the amount of people that are here.

676
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:58,570
Why can I not do this?

677
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:03,239
Why the hell would I want that?

678
00:55:03,239 --> 00:55:05,239
Why would I want that to be the thing that trends?

679
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:09,980
Hold on.

680
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:14,250
Let me just plug

681
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:18,150
in my other

682
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:20,150
gamecube number four here.

683
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:23,289
Get it plugged in

684
00:55:23,289 --> 00:55:27,900
and turned on.

685
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:31,099
Davecube.

686
00:55:31,099 --> 00:55:33,099
Senator from

687
00:55:33,099 --> 00:55:35,099
Miami please step forward.

688
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:37,099
Yes, it's me.

689
00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:39,099
Dave. I'd like to introduce

690
00:55:39,099 --> 00:55:41,099
Bill number

691
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:43,099
S2101 to rename

692
00:55:43,099 --> 00:55:45,099
the gamecube, Davecube.

693
00:55:45,099 --> 00:55:47,460
I find this to be incredibly

694
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,460
important to our country's security and to

695
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:51,460
my ego.

696
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:53,460
I'm looking at you over there right now.

697
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:59,739
I just realized something. We're like up in space.

698
00:55:59,739 --> 00:56:01,739
We're looking down. That's kind of insane.

699
00:56:01,739 --> 00:56:05,579
Can the

700
00:56:05,579 --> 00:56:07,579
Senator from Miami please step forward?

701
00:56:07,579 --> 00:56:09,579
Yeah.

702
00:56:09,579 --> 00:56:13,030
I think it's pretentious that I

703
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:15,030
put forward Bill

704
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:17,030
S2101 to

705
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:19,400
rename Dark Souls

706
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,400
to Dave Souls.

707
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:26,389
It might as well be this stupid shit.

708
00:56:26,389 --> 00:56:32,340
I'll be honest with you.

709
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:34,340
If that was on C-SPAN today, I probably

710
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:50,469
really wouldn't be surprised.

711
00:56:50,469 --> 00:56:52,469
I'm so not good at this.

712
00:56:52,469 --> 00:56:54,969
These curves are tricky as hell.

713
00:56:54,969 --> 00:56:56,969
I've said that two or three times

714
00:56:56,969 --> 00:56:58,969
today already. Oh, this is like

715
00:56:58,969 --> 00:57:02,360
fun as hell. Why am I doing that?

716
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,360
Is the level moving on its own?

717
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,360
This is fucking hard.

718
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:12,119
Why did I think that was going to work?

719
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:27,670
Dave State.

720
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:29,670
Those of you that are joining us,

721
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:31,670
you have to understand. Do you think

722
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:33,670
that I was going to be able to play

723
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:35,909
through this game

724
00:57:35,909 --> 00:57:37,909
and get to this point

725
00:57:37,909 --> 00:57:39,909
like 50

726
00:57:39,909 --> 00:57:43,110
times?

727
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:45,110
Do you think that was going to happen?

728
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:47,739
We're already here 50

729
00:57:47,739 --> 00:57:56,250
times.

730
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:59,769
Please stop pretending

731
00:57:59,769 --> 00:58:01,769
I'm banning you for life.

732
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:06,500
You completed The Simpsons without

733
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,500
save states. Because I didn't know they

734
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:14,260
existed. I mean, I knew

735
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:16,260
they existed. I knew they

736
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:19,210
existed. But I wasn't

737
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:21,210
using them. Oh my fucking god.

738
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:26,780
I didn't know. I knew what they were.

739
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,780
Hold on. Let me just take a quick sip of something.

740
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:35,750
Okay.

741
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:55,320
God damn it.

742
00:58:58,010 --> 00:59:08,809
I was out of the GameCube.

743
00:59:08,809 --> 00:59:10,809
Just fucking out of the GameCube really quick.

744
00:59:10,809 --> 00:59:13,690
Oh, wow.

745
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:15,690
That was cool. GameCube

746
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:17,690
number five. How many

747
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:22,809
GameCubes is it going to take?

748
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:29,400
I suck at this.

749
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,920
Your room would be so hot right now.

750
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,920
You got like 30

751
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,920
GameCubes all plugged in, all running,

752
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,920
all spinning, and all making disc noises.

753
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:43,780
Can you imagine hearing

754
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:45,780
that typical like

755
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:47,780
I am

756
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:52,460
people that think I'm going to

757
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:54,460
stoop to save stating

758
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:56,460
in the middle of a level.

759
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:58,460
That's not going to happen here.

760
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:00,460
I have to beat it at least

761
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:05,059
on my own. Man.

762
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:07,059
That's so fucking weird.

763
01:00:07,059 --> 01:00:14,300
It just rips you to the side.

764
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:21,460
I'm not getting any.

765
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:25,610
What the fuck?

766
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:27,610
I'm pulling as hard as I can

767
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:33,559
to the right.

768
01:00:33,559 --> 01:00:35,559
What the fuck is this?

769
01:00:35,559 --> 01:00:37,559
What the hell, man? That's actually

770
01:00:37,559 --> 01:00:40,820
infuriating.

771
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:42,820
I'm rolling as far

772
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:57,420
to the left and right as I can.

773
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,590
I'm about to freak out.

774
01:01:05,349 --> 01:01:07,349
Somebody just put my finger

775
01:01:07,349 --> 01:01:09,349
in my belly button and moved it around.

776
01:01:09,349 --> 01:01:11,349
That's what it feels like

777
01:01:11,349 --> 01:01:13,659
if I put my finger in my belly button.

778
01:01:13,659 --> 01:01:15,659
I push and move it around.

779
01:01:27,099 --> 01:01:34,380
It takes too much.

780
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:36,380
End the stream? No. What?

781
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:51,159
Resign. Resign.

782
01:01:51,159 --> 01:01:59,929
I can't end it. No.

783
01:01:59,929 --> 01:02:01,929
I'm not going to end it. I'm not going to end the stream.

784
01:02:01,929 --> 01:02:03,929
Fuck.

785
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:05,929
I'm losing my mind right now.

786
01:02:05,929 --> 01:02:07,929
Not because of the game. Because of the shit that I'm reading.

787
01:02:07,929 --> 01:02:22,969
Oh, no, no.

788
01:02:22,969 --> 01:02:25,590
Oh, no, no.

789
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:31,909
You don't understand.

790
01:02:31,909 --> 01:02:33,909
I'm holding left

791
01:02:33,909 --> 01:02:35,909
as hard as I can to the other side when I get up there.

792
01:02:35,909 --> 01:02:45,320
I fucking hate this.

793
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,320
I can't even fucking do it.

794
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:50,710
Alright, I'm going to put it...

795
01:02:50,710 --> 01:03:00,699
No, I can't use that.

796
01:03:00,699 --> 01:03:02,699
That's an emergency break.

797
01:03:02,699 --> 01:03:04,699
I'm not pulling the emergency break right now.

798
01:03:04,699 --> 01:03:09,239
Got it! Oh, fuck.

799
01:03:09,239 --> 01:03:12,380
No!

800
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:14,380
I can't pull the Rat Tatooie

801
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:16,380
emergency break. I can't pull it yet.

802
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:26,489
I stopped screaming. What are you, crazy?

803
01:03:26,489 --> 01:03:37,300
I'm going to go as slow as

804
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:39,929
possible. Fuck, it just rips

805
01:03:39,929 --> 01:03:44,659
you down. No, my God!

806
01:03:44,659 --> 01:03:46,659
I'm not pretending. I'm not.

807
01:03:46,659 --> 01:03:48,659
I swear to God.

808
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:50,659
Okay, stop. I'm going to relax.

809
01:03:50,659 --> 01:04:07,110
I'm not...

810
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:09,110
Imagine having to be really self-conscious

811
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:11,110
about the fact that you promised to people

812
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:13,110
you're not pretending to lose

813
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:32,380
at a GameCube game. Fuck you!

814
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:35,699
Fuck you! Stop!

815
01:04:35,699 --> 01:04:40,119
Stop! I didn't even do anything!

816
01:04:40,119 --> 01:04:42,739
Pull back!

817
01:04:42,739 --> 01:04:45,050
I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything.

818
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:47,989
I didn't even do anything. I was going

819
01:04:47,989 --> 01:05:01,300
so slow. Yes, your

820
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,300
problem. No, if I go fast, it just throws

821
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,300
me right off.

822
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:16,059
Dude, I'm holding it as

823
01:05:16,059 --> 01:05:18,059
tight as I can to the bottom.

824
01:05:18,059 --> 01:05:20,059
I'm holding it as tight as I can, and I'm just

825
01:05:20,059 --> 01:05:43,989
slowly falling down. Ah!

826
01:05:43,989 --> 01:05:54,280
No!

827
01:05:54,280 --> 01:06:11,559
Fuck! What is hard like?

828
01:06:11,559 --> 01:06:13,559
What I want to know. This is advanced? What's the other...

829
01:06:13,559 --> 01:06:18,420
What's the hard ones like?

830
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:25,719
Take this audio and put it over

831
01:06:25,719 --> 01:06:27,719
me watching

832
01:06:27,719 --> 01:06:29,719
like big moments in TV shows.

833
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:31,719
Like daytime TV shows, like soap operas.

834
01:06:31,719 --> 01:06:37,420
Like when is the reveal that...

835
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:39,420
Wait! No!

836
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:41,420
I'm in the hospital and you're not the father!

837
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:43,420
No! Fuck no!

838
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:50,519
I'm just having

839
01:06:50,519 --> 01:06:52,519
extreme reactions to daytime TV.

840
01:06:52,519 --> 01:06:54,519
Like, settle down.

841
01:06:54,519 --> 01:07:10,900
Cut that. Okay. This is where I

842
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:16,599
fuck it up every time. Stop and

843
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:18,599
fucking run!

844
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:21,099
Run up it! Oh!

845
01:07:21,099 --> 01:07:23,099
Thank you!

846
01:07:23,099 --> 01:07:25,980
What? God damn it.

847
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:34,869
Lore 16.

848
01:07:34,869 --> 01:07:39,860
I'm not doing that one again.

849
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:45,159
Let's first try this one. What do you say?

850
01:07:45,159 --> 01:07:50,789
I had it.

851
01:07:50,789 --> 01:07:52,789
Imagine getting angry about silly monkeys in a ball.

852
01:07:52,789 --> 01:07:59,369
Alright, dude.

853
01:07:59,369 --> 01:08:01,860
I need to do it. I have to.

854
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:04,619
I don't care.

855
01:08:04,619 --> 01:08:08,139
Check this link.

856
01:08:08,139 --> 01:08:10,760
I need 100 bananas.

857
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:22,970
What are you guys doing?

858
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:24,970
What are you doing? What have you done?

859
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:29,770
No, it's not real.

860
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:31,770
It's not real.

861
01:08:31,770 --> 01:08:35,100
It's not real.

862
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:37,779
It's not real.

863
01:08:37,779 --> 01:08:43,029
But it's so stupid.

864
01:08:43,029 --> 01:08:46,810
Miami Republican

865
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:48,810
Senator Dave State introduces Bill which

866
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:50,810
would rename Nintendo's GameCube to the

867
01:08:50,810 --> 01:09:03,739
DaveCube.

868
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:05,739
That's so stupid. I can't even address it.

869
01:09:05,739 --> 01:09:08,619
No, I'm not pulling the rat tattoo

870
01:09:08,619 --> 01:09:18,659
emergency break.

871
01:09:18,659 --> 01:09:20,659
This is really fucking hard.

872
01:09:20,659 --> 01:09:23,420
Four and a half hours my ass.

873
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:25,420
No way this took four and a half hours for someone to beat the whole game.

874
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:39,819
The whole game?

875
01:09:39,819 --> 01:09:41,819
You're just bad, OmegaLul.

876
01:09:41,819 --> 01:09:44,630
Wait, that wasn't even an OmegaLul.

877
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:46,630
That was a regular lul. I increased your lul

878
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:57,960
for you.

879
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:02,250
That's not that bad.

880
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:04,250
I can't imagine people that can just scream through all these levels.

881
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:08,149
Like, holy shit, how?

882
01:10:20,170 --> 01:10:22,170
Watch the speedrun. It's insane.

883
01:10:22,170 --> 01:10:25,109
I can imagine. This is insane.

884
01:10:25,109 --> 01:10:27,109
You suck, dude, OmegaLul. Stop.

885
01:10:27,109 --> 01:10:30,380
Somebody said Conan O'Brien?

886
01:10:34,409 --> 01:10:36,409
I don't understand this monkey ball thing.

887
01:10:36,409 --> 01:10:40,630
I guess it's really hard.

888
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:45,619
Gaming with Conan.

889
01:10:45,619 --> 01:10:47,619
Conan O'Brien level

890
01:10:47,619 --> 01:10:49,619
of skill level.

891
01:10:49,619 --> 01:10:51,859
That's so...

892
01:10:51,859 --> 01:10:53,859
That makes me feel a certain way.

893
01:10:53,859 --> 01:10:59,939
It does.

894
01:10:59,939 --> 01:11:01,939
Look at this next part coming up. You shitting me.

895
01:11:01,939 --> 01:11:08,149
There's no way.

896
01:11:08,149 --> 01:11:17,479
There's no way I do this.

897
01:11:17,479 --> 01:11:23,819
Don't tell me to fucking hurry up. I hate that.

898
01:11:30,539 --> 01:11:43,779
It's too stressful.

899
01:11:43,779 --> 01:11:45,779
These are easy. Just get here quickly.

900
01:11:45,779 --> 01:11:50,069
This part that I fell off on.

901
01:11:50,069 --> 01:11:52,890
Who cares about the 10 straight seconds

902
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:54,890
it's going to take to Conan that banana?

903
01:11:54,890 --> 01:12:04,229
Goddamn it. Stripper is in the window.

904
01:12:04,229 --> 01:12:08,260
What window?

905
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:10,260
I thought you were talking about my window.

906
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:23,060
That would be really weird.

907
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:29,579
He looked.

908
01:12:29,579 --> 01:12:31,579
I was just trying to figure out what you were talking about.

909
01:12:31,579 --> 01:12:38,470
I did look.

910
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:41,659
Now slow it down.

911
01:12:41,659 --> 01:12:45,239
What are you doing?

912
01:12:45,239 --> 01:12:47,239
I got 30 seconds to get through this. Just go slow.

913
01:12:47,239 --> 01:13:01,899
Fucking no.

914
01:13:01,899 --> 01:13:03,899
No. It's that last little turn.

915
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:33,020
Conan would have the celebrity

916
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:37,939
play this part.

917
01:13:37,939 --> 01:13:39,939
If it was me, then we would

918
01:13:39,939 --> 01:13:43,140
really be fucked.

919
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:45,140
So Jerma, how you doing? You having trouble with this level?

920
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:47,140
Yeah, I'm bad at the game.

921
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:49,140
Me too.

922
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:52,859
I'm sorry.

923
01:13:52,859 --> 01:13:54,859
I'm supposed to be like a

924
01:13:54,859 --> 01:14:00,939
streamer or something.

925
01:14:00,939 --> 01:14:02,939
You're going to have to recut this whole thing and redo this whole thing.

926
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:04,939
Put a dog here or something.

927
01:14:04,939 --> 01:14:06,939
I'm really sorry.

928
01:14:06,939 --> 01:14:08,939
You can use that idea though.

929
01:14:08,939 --> 01:14:10,939
If I get like 10% royalty from whatever

930
01:14:10,939 --> 01:14:12,939
the advertising comes in that show

931
01:14:12,939 --> 01:14:14,939
that day.

932
01:14:14,939 --> 01:14:16,939
I'll give you the idea and set it up for you.

933
01:14:16,939 --> 01:14:30,250
At least one of those bananas.

934
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:37,539
I'll be happy.

935
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:39,539
I'm starting to think you don't have a bunch of game cubes

936
01:14:39,539 --> 01:14:42,739
with safe states.

937
01:14:42,739 --> 01:14:44,739
Fuck no.

938
01:14:44,739 --> 01:14:46,739
I can't not pay attention.

939
01:14:46,739 --> 01:14:50,579
They would be

940
01:14:50,579 --> 01:14:52,579
stacked up in the garage

941
01:14:52,579 --> 01:14:57,899
at this point.

942
01:14:57,899 --> 01:14:59,899
It would be in the bathtub

943
01:14:59,899 --> 01:15:01,899
stacked.

944
01:15:01,899 --> 01:15:03,899
In the toilets. In the fridge.

945
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:06,390
There would be no where to put them.

946
01:15:06,390 --> 01:15:15,670
You know what I think?

947
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:17,670
Here's the other problem. I think it's the music that's doing it to me too.

948
01:15:17,670 --> 01:15:22,020
Oh my god.

949
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:24,020
My fucking computer.

950
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:54,859
Yeah.

951
01:15:54,859 --> 01:15:57,479
Put on a different soundtrack.

952
01:15:57,479 --> 01:15:59,479
Put a different soundtrack on.

953
01:15:59,479 --> 01:16:05,689
Put another soundtrack on?

954
01:16:05,689 --> 01:16:08,119
Wait, is there a race? I'm racing somebody.

955
01:16:08,119 --> 01:16:17,460
Yeah.

956
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:19,460
I'm not sure how much longer I can take.

957
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:21,460
Like the Sega Bass Pro Fishing soundtrack.

958
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:30,340
Why was that one hard?

959
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:33,800
Oh, this one looks elaborate.

960
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:40,010
These shortcuts, damn it.

961
01:16:40,010 --> 01:16:46,729
Get out of here.

962
01:16:46,729 --> 01:16:56,970
I need this.

963
01:16:56,970 --> 01:16:58,970
So I don't have to save the thing that

964
01:16:58,970 --> 01:17:00,970
the Senator was doing.

965
01:17:00,970 --> 01:17:15,109
Stop doing that. Oh, it's irritating.

966
01:17:15,109 --> 01:17:17,109
I even get irritated in the actual pinball machines

967
01:17:17,109 --> 01:17:19,109
if this happens. I'm just like, stop doing that.

968
01:17:19,109 --> 01:17:29,930
Shut up.

969
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:35,050
This, what's this, water level?

970
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:44,060
First try, let's go.

971
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:51,079
This one's not even that bad.

972
01:17:51,079 --> 01:17:53,079
A dull submarine.

973
01:17:53,079 --> 01:18:03,699
What are you? Dull.

974
01:18:03,699 --> 01:18:17,189
I just wanted to get the bananas.

975
01:18:17,189 --> 01:18:19,189
Insane aquarium? Oh, that's one of the greatest video games of all time.

976
01:18:19,189 --> 01:18:22,649
I'm glad you agree.

977
01:18:22,649 --> 01:18:24,649
Alright, so I have to stay really close and then

978
01:18:24,649 --> 01:18:26,649
bang a right, right? That's kind of how this works.

979
01:18:26,649 --> 01:18:36,939
Jesus.

980
01:18:36,939 --> 01:18:39,180
Alright, I'm good. This one wasn't that bad.

981
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:44,979
Why do you speed run this one?

982
01:18:44,979 --> 01:18:52,979
That would be very hard to do.

983
01:18:52,979 --> 01:18:59,060
Bring back grandpa.

984
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:04,060
I don't know, man.

985
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:06,300
What? You don't have to go in that hole?

986
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:11,720
Where's the goal?

987
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,720
Oh, it's over there. Oh, shit, okay.

988
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:20,500
Bring him back from hell.

989
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:25,670
I don't really want to.

990
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:27,670
Oh, shit, that's going to be fucking hard.

991
01:19:27,670 --> 01:19:36,310
I already know it. Bring back Bugleberry.

992
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:38,680
You will see him again.

993
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:41,300
Don't worry. Just at least get the

994
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:45,319
big one up here.

995
01:19:45,319 --> 01:19:47,319
At least. Okay, go. I don't care.

996
01:19:47,319 --> 01:19:55,699
Oh, boy, this one.

997
01:19:55,699 --> 01:19:59,989
Halloween Bugleberry

998
01:19:59,989 --> 01:20:03,510
stream?

999
01:20:03,510 --> 01:20:07,670
Maybe. I don't think anyone that's

1000
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:09,670
ever played this game has ever fallen through that one.

1001
01:20:09,670 --> 01:20:11,670
I don't think so.

1002
01:20:11,670 --> 01:20:13,670
I think I might be the first one.

1003
01:20:13,670 --> 01:20:23,210
I'm going to hug the left side.

1004
01:20:23,210 --> 01:20:25,449
Uh,

1005
01:20:25,449 --> 01:20:28,069
what's the map? Do I get the bananas?

1006
01:20:28,069 --> 01:20:31,960
I'm running out of time.

1007
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:34,649
How do I get those?

1008
01:20:34,649 --> 01:20:36,649
Hold on, I got it, I got it, I got it.

1009
01:20:36,649 --> 01:20:39,529
Do the mandatory

1010
01:20:39,529 --> 01:20:41,529
ego boost stream when Bugleberry's on.

1011
01:20:41,529 --> 01:20:43,529
That's a fucking brilliant idea.

1012
01:20:43,529 --> 01:20:51,909
Fuck the bananas.

1013
01:20:51,909 --> 01:20:57,289
I want them.

1014
01:20:57,289 --> 01:20:59,289
I want it.

1015
01:20:59,289 --> 01:21:05,239
Oh, my God, this one. I don't like this. I hate this one.

1016
01:21:05,239 --> 01:21:08,819
Are you going to play Saw again? Yeah, I'm going to play Saw.

1017
01:21:08,819 --> 01:21:10,819
I'm going to finish Saw 1.

1018
01:21:10,819 --> 01:21:12,819
And then go to Saw 2.

1019
01:21:12,819 --> 01:21:20,630
Probably on the same day.

1020
01:21:20,630 --> 01:21:23,899
Get a bunch of speed running this thing. Just do it.

1021
01:21:23,899 --> 01:21:27,100
And now, what?

1022
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:31,449
Go down?

1023
01:21:31,449 --> 01:21:38,979
Is this on a slant?

1024
01:21:38,979 --> 01:21:42,250
No, this is good.

1025
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:44,739
Oh, I could have got those bananas over there.

1026
01:21:44,739 --> 01:21:49,989
Shit.

1027
01:21:49,989 --> 01:21:51,989
Oh, my God, click the funny link, Germo.

1028
01:21:51,989 --> 01:21:55,380
Uh, I'm not clicking any links.

1029
01:21:55,380 --> 01:22:04,859
Can you play Hylix?

1030
01:22:04,859 --> 01:22:06,859
I actually have that now.

1031
01:22:06,859 --> 01:22:15,159
I bought that a while ago.

1032
01:22:15,159 --> 01:22:20,470
Holy shit, this one's insane.

1033
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:22,470
I only missed a banana. Yeah.

1034
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:24,470
I'm fine.

1035
01:22:24,470 --> 01:22:30,420
I'll be good. Hylix OST

1036
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:33,300
fucks.

1037
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:37,850
Dude, how would you do this without

1038
01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:49,619
Oh, my God, don't

1039
01:22:49,619 --> 01:22:51,619
just forget about the bananas and just do it.

1040
01:22:51,619 --> 01:22:54,180
Do it. Just go.

1041
01:22:54,180 --> 01:22:57,579
Oh, by the way, let me just

1042
01:22:57,579 --> 01:22:59,579
make a comment on this.

1043
01:22:59,579 --> 01:23:01,579
This is not a Mario slide

1044
01:23:01,579 --> 01:23:03,750
game. The reason why

1045
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:05,750
I decided to play this is because I was like, man,

1046
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:07,750
I wish there was a game where it was only Mario slides.

1047
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:09,750
This is not it.

1048
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:34,890
Super Mario.

1049
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:38,090
Wait, I might just be making

1050
01:23:38,090 --> 01:23:40,090
this up and somebody probably just didn't even say this, but

1051
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:42,090
did somebody just say that there

1052
01:23:42,090 --> 01:23:44,090
was a Mario 64 ROM hack

1053
01:23:44,090 --> 01:23:46,090
with all slides?

1054
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:48,329
Did I make that up?

1055
01:23:48,329 --> 01:23:50,329
Did I, like, take somebody's words and just

1056
01:23:50,329 --> 01:23:55,579
twist them completely?

1057
01:23:55,579 --> 01:23:57,579
There is. No, shit. Is it really?

1058
01:23:57,579 --> 01:24:03,079
Oh, that's awesome.

1059
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:12,550
I might have to look into that.

1060
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:17,420
There are so many. I'll have to give them a try.

1061
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:20,100
That sounds fun. I love

1062
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:32,970
Mario slides. Don't fall

1063
01:24:32,970 --> 01:24:34,970
into one of the small ones. Okay.

1064
01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:36,970
Not too hard, not too soft, just right.

1065
01:24:36,970 --> 01:24:38,970
Not too hard, not too

1066
01:24:38,970 --> 01:24:40,970
soft, just right.

1067
01:24:40,970 --> 01:24:52,920
Like that. Oh, shit.

1068
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:55,100
This one's crazy. Oh, man.

1069
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:57,100
This one's crazy.

1070
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:59,659
Good commentary on the game.

1071
01:24:59,659 --> 01:25:01,659
Oh, man. This one's gonna be nuts.

1072
01:25:01,659 --> 01:25:07,539
Oh, boy.

1073
01:25:07,539 --> 01:25:09,539
That's already, I can already tell this is gonna be a

1074
01:25:09,539 --> 01:25:11,779
this one's gonna be a hell.

1075
01:25:11,779 --> 01:25:13,779
I just tried to do the whole thing in one go?

1076
01:25:13,779 --> 01:25:19,420
No, I'm not that good. I'm not that smart.

1077
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:24,220
Whatever. Just go really fast.

1078
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:34,460
How's my voice not get tired?

1079
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:37,590
Well, it's from years of being

1080
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:39,770
classically trained to

1081
01:25:39,770 --> 01:25:41,770
be speaking and singing in a way.

1082
01:25:41,770 --> 01:25:43,939
Like, for instance, I'm

1083
01:25:43,939 --> 01:25:45,939
contracting my vocal cords in a way that make it so it's not

1084
01:25:45,939 --> 01:25:47,939
so much strain.

1085
01:25:49,939 --> 01:25:51,939
Like it's, I've been trained

1086
01:25:51,939 --> 01:26:03,340
pretty well. You're taught

1087
01:26:03,340 --> 01:26:05,340
during vocal school to only use about

1088
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:07,340
10% of your power level in your voice?

1089
01:26:09,770 --> 01:26:22,439
I wasn't paying attention. I was doing

1090
01:26:22,439 --> 01:26:25,319
pretty good.

1091
01:26:25,319 --> 01:26:30,760
Oh, fuck you. What would 20%

1092
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:35,880
of your power level look like?

1093
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:37,880
And they make a whole TV show about that?

1094
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:40,949
She's using more than

1095
01:26:40,949 --> 01:26:42,949
10% of her brain and she can

1096
01:26:42,949 --> 01:26:44,949
fold cars in half with her mind.

1097
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:01,800
That's the way the lady could like look at

1098
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,800
people and fold them into a pretzel.

1099
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:22,619
I'm not gonna get this right ever.

1100
01:27:22,619 --> 01:27:35,289
Stop. It was called Lucy

1101
01:27:35,289 --> 01:27:39,189
with Scarlett Johansson.

1102
01:27:39,189 --> 01:27:49,819
Yeah. We're on the Conan

1103
01:27:49,819 --> 01:27:53,399
OST. There's no Conan

1104
01:27:53,399 --> 01:27:56,859
OST. They just play

1105
01:27:56,859 --> 01:27:58,859
Does that mean I'm going max speed?

1106
01:27:58,859 --> 01:28:06,859
There's no Conan OST.

1107
01:28:06,859 --> 01:28:08,859
Why would there be a Conan OST?

1108
01:28:08,859 --> 01:28:14,869
The Conan OST is just

1109
01:28:14,869 --> 01:28:16,869
background jazz music.

1110
01:28:16,869 --> 01:28:22,949
I'm looking at chat and I'm not

1111
01:28:22,949 --> 01:28:27,880
looking at the game. Conan OST.

1112
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:30,439
Oh, okay. Well, there's

1113
01:28:30,439 --> 01:28:32,439
a Conan the Barbarian OST.

1114
01:28:32,439 --> 01:28:46,970
Hold on. Let me just

1115
01:28:46,970 --> 01:28:53,050
play it, play it, play it.

1116
01:28:53,050 --> 01:28:55,539
Why are you looking at the QRS

1117
01:28:55,539 --> 01:29:08,140
clip?

1118
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:11,659
What a fucked up stream.

1119
01:29:11,659 --> 01:29:13,659
I was drunk.

1120
01:29:13,659 --> 01:29:16,279
Like really drunk

1121
01:29:16,279 --> 01:29:18,279
on that stream.

1122
01:29:18,279 --> 01:29:21,420
Okay, slow down. Don't go

1123
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:23,420
this fast. Here it comes.

1124
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:27,640
Okay, I got it.

1125
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:30,579
I got it. I got it. I'm good. I'm good.

1126
01:29:30,579 --> 01:29:33,659
Oh, really? Yeah.

1127
01:29:33,659 --> 01:29:47,529
Oh, I have to go

1128
01:29:47,529 --> 01:29:52,260
that way.

1129
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:57,829
Did I Dave State this?

1130
01:29:57,829 --> 01:29:59,829
Fuck. Not good. Just fall off. Who cares?

1131
01:29:59,829 --> 01:30:12,949
What the hell? How am I?

1132
01:30:12,949 --> 01:30:18,649
Everybody said what is it? Dave

1133
01:30:18,649 --> 01:30:21,590
State? Oh, right. You might not have been

1134
01:30:21,590 --> 01:30:24,149
here.

1135
01:30:24,149 --> 01:30:28,819
I don't know. I need to go fast.

1136
01:30:28,819 --> 01:30:30,819
Yeah, but I went fast last time. I overshot it, didn't I?

1137
01:30:30,819 --> 01:30:34,020
Oh, fuck. Okay, I got it.

1138
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:37,670
Dave Cube.

1139
01:30:37,670 --> 01:30:50,579
I got it. Yeah, that's the

1140
01:30:50,579 --> 01:30:52,579
kind of speed you're looking for. Yeah, it is.

1141
01:30:52,579 --> 01:31:00,069
But that's not going to work out, is it?

1142
01:31:20,119 --> 01:31:27,909
What a fun level.

1143
01:31:27,909 --> 01:31:35,850
It's fun. It's fun.

1144
01:31:35,850 --> 01:31:37,850
Fucking god. Oh, fucking god.

1145
01:31:37,850 --> 01:31:39,850
Listen to me. I said like fucking cool.

1146
01:31:39,850 --> 01:31:41,850
Oh, my god.

1147
01:31:41,850 --> 01:31:55,779
Is this a Dollar Tree streamer?

1148
01:31:55,779 --> 01:31:57,779
I'm trying to piece together what that means.

1149
01:31:57,779 --> 01:31:59,779
I think what you mean by that is

1150
01:31:59,779 --> 01:32:02,600
that this is

1151
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,600
so the gameplay is not

1152
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:07,220
high quality or something.

1153
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:09,220
It's still good enough. You still use it?

1154
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:11,220
I don't know. What does that mean?

1155
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:14,170
Some high quality shit at the dollar store. I don't know

1156
01:32:14,170 --> 01:32:30,359
what you're talking about. You look like

1157
01:32:30,359 --> 01:32:32,359
you came from the dollar store.

1158
01:32:32,359 --> 01:32:35,369
With like a bag of groceries or something?

1159
01:32:35,369 --> 01:32:37,369
Like, who cares?

1160
01:32:37,369 --> 01:32:40,699
Like, oh, I have some stuff from the dollar store.

1161
01:32:40,699 --> 01:32:42,699
Wow, it looks like you really came out of the dollar store.

1162
01:32:42,699 --> 01:32:44,699
Yeah, I came out of the dollar store and I have some stuff

1163
01:32:44,699 --> 01:32:46,699
in a bag. I've got like a

1164
01:32:46,699 --> 01:32:48,699
baseball cap on and a t-shirt. What, is there

1165
01:32:48,699 --> 01:33:03,659
something wrong?

1166
01:33:03,659 --> 01:33:05,659
This is just Fall Guys flashback to that

1167
01:33:05,659 --> 01:33:07,899
stupid level that I don't like.

1168
01:33:07,899 --> 01:33:10,260
Oh, no. Okay. Is this the final level?

1169
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:14,550
Can I go over there in one go?

1170
01:33:14,550 --> 01:33:16,920
Can I go for it?

1171
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:20,569
I can. I can. I can. I can. I can. I can. I can.

1172
01:33:20,569 --> 01:33:40,779
Awww.

1173
01:33:40,779 --> 01:33:55,430
It's not going so fucking fast.

1174
01:33:55,430 --> 01:33:57,430
Dollar store strat.

1175
01:33:57,430 --> 01:33:59,430
That's not even funny.

1176
01:33:59,430 --> 01:34:01,430
Where's the humor there?

1177
01:34:01,430 --> 01:34:03,800
What's the joke?

1178
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:05,800
I don't understand. Explain the joke to me.

1179
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:17,449
Why did I go that way?

1180
01:34:17,449 --> 01:34:25,130
I know what it means.

1181
01:34:25,130 --> 01:34:27,819
Oh, shit. It's Frogger.

1182
01:34:27,819 --> 01:34:43,619
I have to get the rope. Okay.

1183
01:34:43,619 --> 01:35:00,710
Oh, please. Why did I get on that?

1184
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:06,340
Dude.

1185
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:08,340
Imagine being like a kid with

1186
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:10,340
a GameCube controller in your hand right now.

1187
01:35:10,340 --> 01:35:12,579
And you have your memory card plugged in

1188
01:35:12,579 --> 01:35:14,579
and you get to here. This is a level of like

1189
01:35:14,579 --> 01:35:16,579
30. And you have to do this

1190
01:35:16,579 --> 01:35:18,579
bullshit like this many times

1191
01:35:18,579 --> 01:35:20,579
before you get it right. You have to play through the game

1192
01:35:20,579 --> 01:35:24,869
45 times.

1193
01:35:24,869 --> 01:35:26,869
Four and a half my ass.

1194
01:35:26,869 --> 01:35:39,220
Four and a half. Did I say 45?

1195
01:35:39,220 --> 01:35:41,220
Yeah, four and a half my ass. Not 45

1196
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:47,750
my ass. I don't have to wait for a hole in the

1197
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:49,750
cycle, I think so. Wait. I can get in this one.

1198
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:58,250
There it is. Nice.

1199
01:35:58,250 --> 01:36:03,420
That's it.

1200
01:36:03,420 --> 01:36:14,939
I did it. We're free.

1201
01:36:14,939 --> 01:36:22,420
Wait, am I falling right now out of the sky?

1202
01:36:22,420 --> 01:36:30,489
Now to expert. I'm gonna

1203
01:36:30,489 --> 01:36:36,619
I'm gonna try it. Let's turn the music off

1204
01:36:36,619 --> 01:36:43,460
though. Oh, the sub thing. Right.

1205
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:53,899
The sub bananas. Presented by

1206
01:36:53,899 --> 01:36:58,060
Sega. He's going to die so much.

1207
01:36:58,060 --> 01:37:12,649
Okay. I don't care.

1208
01:37:12,649 --> 01:37:22,060
The name doesn't even matter. That was

1209
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:24,869
advanced mode. We're now going to move

1210
01:37:24,869 --> 01:37:39,189
on to expert mode.

1211
01:37:39,189 --> 01:37:43,739
I'll try GonGon.

1212
01:37:43,739 --> 01:37:45,739
Expert. 50 stages.

1213
01:37:45,739 --> 01:37:51,750
This is gonna be horrible. Was there some

1214
01:37:51,750 --> 01:37:53,750
weird link we wanted to click on? Alright.

1215
01:37:53,750 --> 01:38:02,329
Fake Trump

1216
01:38:02,329 --> 01:38:04,329
suite.

1217
01:38:04,329 --> 01:38:09,260
I've just heard about DaveGate.

1218
01:38:09,260 --> 01:38:11,260
The American people shouldn't tolerate

1219
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:13,260
this name change. From Game

1220
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:15,750
Cube to DaveCube. As a gamer

1221
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:17,930
myself, I will not let this

1222
01:38:17,930 --> 01:38:19,930
happen. Senator Dave needs to

1223
01:38:19,930 --> 01:38:21,930
resign immediately. Right now.

1224
01:38:21,930 --> 01:38:38,100
Here we go.

1225
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:40,100
Biggly.

1226
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:43,689
Biggly Choo.

1227
01:38:43,689 --> 01:38:54,890
Expert time. Nothing. Alright.

1228
01:38:54,890 --> 01:38:56,890
Let's get the yo.

1229
01:38:56,890 --> 01:38:58,890
It's not. Why are there two

1230
01:38:58,890 --> 01:39:05,930
goals? What's a red goal do?

1231
01:39:05,930 --> 01:39:14,500
Holy shit. That's a lot

1232
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:21,859
of bananas. I'm gonna get

1233
01:39:21,859 --> 01:39:26,409
them all. I just jumped to

1234
01:39:26,409 --> 01:39:28,409
floor five? I just skipped the floor.

1235
01:39:28,409 --> 01:39:32,310
Holy shit. Okay. I've jumped.

1236
01:39:32,310 --> 01:39:45,619
I skipped it. I can

1237
01:39:45,619 --> 01:39:47,619
see how 13

1238
01:39:47,619 --> 01:39:49,619
or 14 year old me would have played this game.

1239
01:39:49,619 --> 01:39:51,619
A million times. Even if I lost

1240
01:39:51,619 --> 01:39:53,619
every time. I would just be

1241
01:39:53,619 --> 01:39:55,619
after school with like a peanut butter and fluff sandwich.

1242
01:39:55,619 --> 01:39:59,340
And I would get sticky fluff

1243
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:01,340
hands all over the controller and I would not clean it.

1244
01:40:01,340 --> 01:40:03,829
It would never be cleaned. It would just

1245
01:40:03,829 --> 01:40:14,069
cake on there. You know

1246
01:40:14,069 --> 01:40:17,270
what fluff is? Oh right. Fluff is

1247
01:40:17,270 --> 01:40:19,270
a New England thing, isn't it?

1248
01:40:19,270 --> 01:40:22,470
It's like marshmallow cream.

1249
01:40:22,470 --> 01:40:25,029
Kraft has a wicked shitty

1250
01:40:25,029 --> 01:40:27,029
version called like Jet Puff.

1251
01:40:27,029 --> 01:40:29,029
This stuff sucks. Not the same.

1252
01:40:29,029 --> 01:40:40,550
Everybody has fluff?

1253
01:40:40,550 --> 01:40:49,189
No they don't. That was

1254
01:40:49,189 --> 01:40:51,189
stupid. That was stupid, Jeremy.

1255
01:40:51,189 --> 01:40:53,189
Why are you doing stupid things?

1256
01:40:53,189 --> 01:41:12,060
Uh. Uh.

1257
01:41:12,060 --> 01:41:27,670
Uh. Uh.

1258
01:41:27,670 --> 01:41:32,409
Don't you fucking crash on me.

1259
01:41:32,409 --> 01:41:42,140
This one sucks.

1260
01:41:42,140 --> 01:41:44,140
I haven't even played it yet. Can I skip?

1261
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:49,699
We have fluff in the south. We call it

1262
01:41:49,699 --> 01:41:51,699
peanut butter and fluff. Fluffernutter. Yeah.

1263
01:41:51,699 --> 01:41:53,699
Me too.

1264
01:41:53,699 --> 01:41:57,609
A lot of places don't have it though.

1265
01:41:57,609 --> 01:42:08,659
That's hard. Why continue?

1266
01:42:08,659 --> 01:42:10,659
We already have infinite continues.

1267
01:42:10,659 --> 01:42:17,899
You're never going to beat this by the way.

1268
01:42:17,899 --> 01:42:19,899
Hold on. You say I'm

1269
01:42:19,899 --> 01:42:28,729
never going to beat this.

1270
01:42:28,729 --> 01:42:30,970
Never. The answer

1271
01:42:30,970 --> 01:42:34,300
the answer is never.

1272
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:36,300
Shit that was so fast.

1273
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:40,520
Never. Ever.

1274
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:58,500
Not ever. Oh man.

1275
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:08,869
You're too old.

1276
01:43:08,869 --> 01:43:12,460
Well. Hey.

1277
01:43:12,460 --> 01:43:14,460
How about this. I'll tell you when I'm going

1278
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:16,460
to give up. Not the other way around.

1279
01:43:16,460 --> 01:43:25,029
Vod Watcher is skip.

1280
01:43:25,029 --> 01:43:28,739
Well that's the beauty of being a Vod

1281
01:43:28,739 --> 01:43:30,739
Watcher. You can watch

1282
01:43:30,739 --> 01:43:32,739
every portion of the stream you want. You can rewind

1283
01:43:32,739 --> 01:43:34,739
this ten times. And watch

1284
01:43:34,739 --> 01:43:36,739
me do this right now.

1285
01:43:36,739 --> 01:43:51,899
Fucking God. You didn't.

1286
01:43:51,899 --> 01:43:53,899
Okay. I was misled.

1287
01:43:53,899 --> 01:43:56,840
German Monkey Ball is like a Mario

1288
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:58,840
slide game. No, no, no. It's a balancing beam

1289
01:43:58,840 --> 01:44:00,840
game. Very different.

1290
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:02,840
And very much not in my wheelhouse.

1291
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:16,470
Alright. Easy.

1292
01:44:16,470 --> 01:44:22,920
Okay. Oh.

1293
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:24,920
Yuck. Yuck.

1294
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:26,920
Balancing beam bullshit.

1295
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:29,350
It's not a Mario slide game.

1296
01:44:29,350 --> 01:44:42,729
It's a balancing beam game.

1297
01:44:42,729 --> 01:44:44,729
Oh. I'm sorry. That hurt.

1298
01:44:44,729 --> 01:44:49,020
You're playing the wrong one.

1299
01:44:49,020 --> 01:44:52,659
How could they be a right monkey. Aren't they all fun

1300
01:44:52,659 --> 01:44:54,659
and all like this?

1301
01:44:54,659 --> 01:44:57,859
Although, wait. There probably is one

1302
01:44:57,859 --> 01:44:59,859
Super Monkey Ball party game.

1303
01:44:59,859 --> 01:45:02,300
Where it's just like Mario Party but it's

1304
01:45:02,300 --> 01:45:07,029
Monkey Ball. Okay.

1305
01:45:07,029 --> 01:45:09,029
Go fast maybe? Just run.

1306
01:45:09,029 --> 01:45:11,029
Am I going to fall through that?

1307
01:45:11,029 --> 01:45:14,939
I'm going to try to go very fast.

1308
01:45:14,939 --> 01:45:20,890
Holy shit. It worked. Boy.

1309
01:45:20,890 --> 01:45:27,930
My God. This is so hard.

1310
01:45:27,930 --> 01:45:29,930
No way.

1311
01:45:29,930 --> 01:45:31,930
Dude.

1312
01:45:31,930 --> 01:45:33,930
No way.

1313
01:45:33,930 --> 01:45:41,739
Not a chance.

1314
01:45:41,739 --> 01:45:43,739
In hell. That's so hard.

1315
01:45:43,739 --> 01:45:49,689
That's so stressful.

1316
01:45:49,689 --> 01:45:51,689
Somebody said there's like

1317
01:45:51,689 --> 01:45:53,689
one slide.

1318
01:45:53,689 --> 01:45:59,050
Why did it work the first

1319
01:45:59,050 --> 01:46:08,760
time?

1320
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:10,760
Stop.

1321
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:12,760
He's never ever ever going to win.

1322
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:18,779
Okay. Settle down.

1323
01:46:18,779 --> 01:46:30,739
I'm fine. Okay. I'm at that point

1324
01:46:30,739 --> 01:46:32,739
in this room where I can feel like

1325
01:46:32,739 --> 01:46:34,739
the criticism. I can

1326
01:46:34,739 --> 01:46:36,739
hear it. I can feel it. It's like

1327
01:46:36,739 --> 01:46:38,739
in my nose. It's itching.

1328
01:46:38,739 --> 01:46:40,739
I can hear what you're saying.

1329
01:46:40,739 --> 01:46:49,510
Why did it work the first

1330
01:46:49,510 --> 01:46:51,510
time? Why did it work the first time?

1331
01:46:51,510 --> 01:46:58,739
Why did it work the first time?

1332
01:46:58,739 --> 01:47:08,090
Thank God I have infinite lives.

1333
01:47:08,090 --> 01:47:12,250
Right now, my

1334
01:47:12,250 --> 01:47:14,250
pants are sagging down to

1335
01:47:14,250 --> 01:47:16,420
my ankles. At the arcade.

1336
01:47:16,420 --> 01:47:18,420
Because they're just so, there's like

1337
01:47:18,420 --> 01:47:20,420
12 pounds of coins.

1338
01:47:20,420 --> 01:47:22,420
In both pockets.

1339
01:47:22,420 --> 01:47:37,399
I have infinite coins.

1340
01:47:37,399 --> 01:48:01,260
Let's

1341
01:48:01,260 --> 01:48:06,630
go to the arcade

1342
01:48:06,630 --> 01:48:08,630
with a diaper on. Full of coins.

1343
01:48:08,630 --> 01:48:12,789
Okay. Is the diaper on

1344
01:48:12,789 --> 01:48:14,789
over your jeans?

1345
01:48:14,789 --> 01:48:17,739
Because that would be okay.

1346
01:48:17,739 --> 01:48:25,930
Wouldn't it? If you had

1347
01:48:25,930 --> 01:48:27,930
a pair of jeans, like you had underwear

1348
01:48:27,930 --> 01:48:29,930
pants, like a pair of jeans on, and then you had

1349
01:48:29,930 --> 01:48:31,930
a diaper on over it. And that's what you

1350
01:48:31,930 --> 01:48:36,600
filled with tokens.

1351
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:38,600
Is that okay? Like what's

1352
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:41,989
wrong with that? Stop

1353
01:48:41,989 --> 01:48:43,989
you motherfucker. I swear to God.

1354
01:48:43,989 --> 01:48:55,500
What do you mean worse?

1355
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:57,500
Hold on, you said you would get arrested

1356
01:48:57,500 --> 01:48:59,500
for doing the Doug funny?

1357
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:01,500
That's, you'd get arrested.

1358
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:05,529
Okay, so if I like brought a

1359
01:49:05,529 --> 01:49:07,529
diaper into a store and held it in my hand,

1360
01:49:07,529 --> 01:49:09,529
and I was like fully closed,

1361
01:49:09,529 --> 01:49:13,619
I would get arrested.

1362
01:49:13,619 --> 01:49:15,619
Why are diapers illegal

1363
01:49:15,619 --> 01:49:28,619
to own? Okay.

1364
01:49:28,619 --> 01:49:30,619
I'm starting to believe that they're, I'm starting

1365
01:49:30,619 --> 01:49:32,619
to believe the people when they say that I'm never going to beat it.

1366
01:49:32,619 --> 01:49:49,560
I almost, okay. Should I

1367
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:51,560
slow it down here? Okay, I've failed this

1368
01:49:51,560 --> 01:49:53,930
over and over and over again by trying

1369
01:49:53,930 --> 01:49:55,930
to run past it as fast as I can.

1370
01:49:55,930 --> 01:49:58,229
So I'm just going to do it

1371
01:49:58,229 --> 01:50:00,229
the way that I think I should be doing it.

1372
01:50:00,229 --> 01:50:23,319
Oh my God.

1373
01:50:23,319 --> 01:50:25,319
You don't have the time to do that.

1374
01:50:25,319 --> 01:50:28,010
That's probably true. Probably right.

1375
01:50:28,010 --> 01:50:36,460
Seven out of fifty.

1376
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:38,630
Yeah, but look,

1377
01:50:38,630 --> 01:50:40,630
this is one of the hard ones. This is the gear check.

1378
01:50:40,630 --> 01:50:42,810
If I can get past this

1379
01:50:42,810 --> 01:50:44,810
one, then I'll just skip to like level twelve eventually

1380
01:50:44,810 --> 01:50:48,710
with one of those skippers.

1381
01:50:48,710 --> 01:50:54,729
Okay, here we go.

1382
01:50:54,729 --> 01:50:56,729
I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it.

1383
01:50:56,729 --> 01:50:59,159
I'm going to save state there. I don't care.

1384
01:50:59,159 --> 01:51:07,420
I'm going to save state right there.

1385
01:51:07,420 --> 01:51:09,420
No, no, no, no, no. Yes.

1386
01:51:09,420 --> 01:51:19,449
Yes.

1387
01:51:19,449 --> 01:51:42,090
I got it this time.

1388
01:51:42,090 --> 01:51:44,090
Somebody just said, oh, yo, dude, I came into the stream.

1389
01:51:44,090 --> 01:51:46,090
You're playing this on the DaveCube, right?

1390
01:51:46,090 --> 01:51:50,760
Yeah, that bill passed.

1391
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:52,760
It turns out nobody actually gives a shit if that's

1392
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:58,329
changed or not.

1393
01:51:58,329 --> 01:52:00,329
This console hasn't been relevant in twenty years.

1394
01:52:00,329 --> 01:52:17,100
No one cares.

1395
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:22,920
No, please.

1396
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:33,800
Why?

1397
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:35,800
I'm one of those people in like the shooting games

1398
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:37,800
that pop up that they go, don't shoot

1399
01:52:37,800 --> 01:53:08,970
me.

1400
01:53:08,970 --> 01:53:10,970
I'm going to get real angry here in a minute.

1401
01:53:10,970 --> 01:53:13,590
I'm going to save state there.

1402
01:53:13,590 --> 01:53:15,590
Use the baby. Why?

1403
01:53:15,590 --> 01:53:20,840
Baby smaller?

1404
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:23,720
Wait, is that real? Am I making this

1405
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:27,180
harder for no reason? Am I?

1406
01:53:27,180 --> 01:53:31,529
I can't change characters in the middle of this.

1407
01:53:31,529 --> 01:53:44,710
Fucking my god.

1408
01:53:44,710 --> 01:53:46,710
What am I going to do here?

1409
01:53:46,710 --> 01:53:48,710
I have to get out of this. I have to get out of this level.

1410
01:53:48,710 --> 01:54:02,140
What the fuck are you doing?

1411
01:54:02,140 --> 01:54:04,140
You can't do this to me. You can't just

1412
01:54:04,140 --> 01:54:25,380
fuck up and. God damn it, Dave.

1413
01:54:25,380 --> 01:54:29,350
God damn it, Dave.

1414
01:54:29,350 --> 01:54:35,500
Why?

1415
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:46,569
It's the fucking music.

1416
01:54:46,569 --> 01:54:53,539
I got to turn the music off. It's the music.

1417
01:54:53,539 --> 01:55:11,909
The music's going off. No!

1418
01:55:11,909 --> 01:55:13,909
That's not good.

1419
01:55:13,909 --> 01:55:31,829
Put it into mono? I'm not going to put it into

1420
01:55:31,829 --> 01:55:46,789
mono. Okay.

1421
01:55:46,789 --> 01:55:53,180
No, I don't want to just do

1422
01:55:53,180 --> 01:55:55,180
this.

1423
01:55:59,180 --> 01:56:02,119
What is this?

1424
01:56:02,119 --> 01:56:26,100
I don't care.

1425
01:56:26,100 --> 01:56:28,409
I really don't even care.

1426
01:56:28,409 --> 01:56:30,409
You could scream in my face if you

1427
01:56:30,409 --> 01:56:32,409
want. You could grab me and pull me and

1428
01:56:32,409 --> 01:56:39,510
scream in my face.

1429
01:56:39,510 --> 01:56:52,119
I'm not even going to need it.

1430
01:56:52,119 --> 01:57:11,640
My hands are so

1431
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:13,819
greasy.

1432
01:57:13,819 --> 01:57:26,229
My hands, it's unbelievable.

1433
01:57:26,229 --> 01:57:28,229
Oh my fucking god, what am I doing? Stop, stop, okay.

1434
01:57:28,229 --> 01:57:59,510
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

1435
01:57:59,510 --> 01:58:08,409
Eventually.

1436
01:58:08,409 --> 01:58:23,050
Oh shit.

1437
01:58:23,050 --> 01:58:25,050
I ran out of disc space

1438
01:58:25,050 --> 01:58:43,670
for the save states.

1439
01:58:43,670 --> 01:58:45,909
Don't do that.

1440
01:58:45,909 --> 01:58:47,909
Okay, don't be a fucking idiot, man.

1441
01:58:47,909 --> 01:58:49,909
I almost just save stated while I was going

1442
01:58:49,909 --> 01:59:00,539
down.

1443
01:59:00,539 --> 01:59:02,539
I have to use one hand.

1444
01:59:02,539 --> 01:59:04,779
I have to use one hand.

1445
01:59:04,779 --> 01:59:08,359
Ow, my chest.

1446
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:19,560
I can't.

1447
01:59:19,560 --> 01:59:21,560
Oh, the time.

1448
01:59:21,560 --> 01:59:23,560
There's no time.

1449
01:59:23,560 --> 01:59:31,880
What?

1450
01:59:31,880 --> 01:59:42,119
Get it.

1451
02:00:05,060 --> 02:00:13,189
Fuck.

1452
02:00:13,189 --> 02:00:19,079
That one was fine.

1453
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:52,539
How can you imagine

1454
02:00:52,539 --> 02:00:55,670
how, think about all the

1455
02:00:55,670 --> 02:00:57,670
times to start over

1456
02:00:57,670 --> 02:00:59,670
and get to the amount of times that I have

1457
02:00:59,670 --> 02:01:01,670
pressed F1, just on that

1458
02:01:01,670 --> 02:01:03,909
beam, and do it all every level

1459
02:01:03,909 --> 02:01:05,909
over again, and that's how many times it takes.

1460
02:01:43,779 --> 02:01:46,789
No!

1461
02:02:13,350 --> 02:02:20,010
Okay, so we're fine. No, that's not the right one.

1462
02:02:20,010 --> 02:02:22,010
That's the save states not doing anything.

1463
02:02:22,010 --> 02:02:34,039
Oh, sad is deranged

1464
02:02:34,039 --> 02:02:37,300
Jeremy now. Wait, what?

1465
02:02:37,300 --> 02:02:39,300
I feel like this one's my wall.

1466
02:02:39,300 --> 02:02:42,060
I really do.

1467
02:02:42,060 --> 02:02:47,750
Oh my fucking god. I am going to

1468
02:02:47,750 --> 02:02:49,750
blow through the rest of this whole

1469
02:02:49,750 --> 02:02:52,569
thing. Once I get past this

1470
02:02:52,569 --> 02:02:55,260
level, I'm going to destroy the rest of the game.

1471
02:02:55,260 --> 02:02:57,260
This is the wall. This is the dumb wall that I have.

1472
02:02:57,260 --> 02:03:13,899
Oh my god, my whole world

1473
02:03:13,899 --> 02:03:17,479
is blending together. The whole world is together.

1474
02:03:17,479 --> 02:03:26,680
I can see everything.

1475
02:03:26,680 --> 02:03:28,680
How the fuck do people play this game?

1476
02:03:28,680 --> 02:03:32,710
It's so ridiculous. The amount of

1477
02:03:32,710 --> 02:03:34,710
coins. I'm going to need five people to come

1478
02:03:34,710 --> 02:03:36,710
into the arcade with me, all filled with diapers.

1479
02:03:36,710 --> 02:03:38,710
All having diapers on.

1480
02:03:38,710 --> 02:03:48,810
Take a break. In a minute.

1481
02:03:48,810 --> 02:03:50,810
I'll go pee in a minute

1482
02:03:50,810 --> 02:04:05,850
and get some water. Okay.

1483
02:04:05,850 --> 02:04:10,460
Let's not screw this up.

1484
02:04:10,460 --> 02:04:12,460
Easy. Let's get it right. Don't

1485
02:04:12,460 --> 02:04:14,460
even if I fall, it's okay. I can do it again.

1486
02:04:14,460 --> 02:04:33,590
You idiot!

1487
02:04:33,590 --> 02:04:53,859
I don't think there was enough

1488
02:04:53,859 --> 02:05:01,220
there wasn't enough time anyways.

1489
02:05:01,220 --> 02:05:03,220
There wasn't enough time anyways, even if I got to the end.

1490
02:05:03,220 --> 02:05:07,510
Oh my fucking god, you've got to be

1491
02:05:07,510 --> 02:05:09,880
kidding me. I have to go much faster than that.

1492
02:05:09,880 --> 02:05:11,880
I've got to go so much faster.

1493
02:05:11,880 --> 02:05:14,180
Oh my god, this is bad.

1494
02:05:14,180 --> 02:05:29,930
Okay, hold on. Fuck you!

1495
02:05:29,930 --> 02:05:54,760
Are we really going to

1496
02:05:54,760 --> 02:05:56,760
hold on guys. Fellas, are we really going to pull off the

1497
02:05:56,760 --> 02:06:00,409
is he pretending line?

1498
02:06:00,409 --> 02:06:02,409
How badly I don't want to be on this level anymore?

1499
02:06:02,409 --> 02:06:28,579
I'm overthinking it.

1500
02:06:28,579 --> 02:06:30,579
Oh my god, I'm stuck here forever.

1501
02:06:30,579 --> 02:06:32,579
I'm stuck here forever, I think.

1502
02:06:32,579 --> 02:06:34,579
I don't think I'll ever get by this ever.

1503
02:06:34,579 --> 02:06:40,090
Put on the face cam?

1504
02:06:40,090 --> 02:06:42,699
No. Oh, I look horrible

1505
02:06:42,699 --> 02:06:49,539
today. All right, slow down.

1506
02:06:49,539 --> 02:06:56,500
Not bad, not bad time.

1507
02:06:56,500 --> 02:06:58,500
Not bad time. Not a bad time.

1508
02:06:58,500 --> 02:07:26,279
Let's go. I do that.

1509
02:07:26,279 --> 02:08:07,859
Can't.

1510
02:08:07,859 --> 02:08:22,710
Risky move, risky move incoming.

1511
02:08:22,710 --> 02:09:08,920
Risky move, I got it. Risky move.

1512
02:09:08,920 --> 02:09:12,550
Okay.

1513
02:09:12,550 --> 02:09:15,619
That was that, that was, I made it.

1514
02:09:15,619 --> 02:09:17,619
About 700 people left the stream.

1515
02:09:17,619 --> 02:09:20,119
So, welcome back if

1516
02:09:20,119 --> 02:09:22,119
you decided to take a break and come back.

1517
02:09:22,119 --> 02:09:27,560
I don't blame you at all.

1518
02:09:27,560 --> 02:09:30,819
In fact, I agree with you.

1519
02:09:30,819 --> 02:09:35,180
Okay.

1520
02:09:35,180 --> 02:09:37,180
That, nothing can be as annoying

1521
02:09:37,180 --> 02:09:47,800
as that one just was.

1522
02:09:47,800 --> 02:09:49,800
All right, it's still fine. It's fine. This one's not bad.

1523
02:09:49,800 --> 02:09:57,220
I think I thought that was gonna work.

1524
02:09:57,220 --> 02:10:30,680
Okay,

1525
02:10:30,680 --> 02:10:32,680
I'd stop doing that. I'm gonna keep crashing

1526
02:10:32,680 --> 02:10:47,529
the fucking console.

1527
02:10:47,529 --> 02:10:49,529
Is Microsoft Edge your default browser?

1528
02:10:49,529 --> 02:10:55,340
What? All right, where we going?

1529
02:10:55,340 --> 02:10:57,340
Where is it? Up?

1530
02:10:57,340 --> 02:11:03,930
It's not up. It's down.

1531
02:11:03,930 --> 02:11:13,590
What? How do I get down there?

1532
02:11:13,590 --> 02:11:15,590
Oh, that was

1533
02:11:15,590 --> 02:11:17,590
hidden. This was not even

1534
02:11:17,590 --> 02:11:20,920
in the...

1535
02:11:20,920 --> 02:11:30,140
I just hold the back...

1536
02:11:30,140 --> 02:11:32,819
Holy shit, man.

1537
02:11:32,819 --> 02:11:34,819
No human can do this.

1538
02:11:34,819 --> 02:11:36,819
This is a game not for humans.

1539
02:11:36,819 --> 02:11:53,590
What the fuck does this keep happening

1540
02:11:53,590 --> 02:12:03,060
for? Imagine the damage you'd be doing

1541
02:12:03,060 --> 02:12:05,060
to your GameCube right now if you just kept on opening

1542
02:12:05,060 --> 02:12:07,369
the lid and ripping

1543
02:12:07,369 --> 02:12:09,369
the power button and pulling the power, like just

1544
02:12:09,369 --> 02:12:22,939
you try to break your console?

1545
02:12:22,939 --> 02:12:26,520
Nobody just gave a bunch of money.

1546
02:12:26,520 --> 02:12:28,520
50 community subs from Freddy Dread. What's up, Freddy?

1547
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:30,520
Thanks for the huge amount of money.

1548
02:12:30,520 --> 02:12:37,880
Holy shit.

1549
02:12:37,880 --> 02:12:39,880
50 more subs from Freddy.

1550
02:12:39,880 --> 02:12:41,880
On top of like the 8,000 he's given the channel

1551
02:12:41,880 --> 02:12:50,010
over the couple of years.

1552
02:12:50,010 --> 02:12:52,010
I don't care. I can at least beat it.

1553
02:12:52,010 --> 02:12:57,189
I don't care if I lose my pride.

1554
02:12:57,189 --> 02:12:59,189
It's still hard. It's still really fucking hard.

1555
02:12:59,189 --> 02:13:03,670
Did IGN beat this game?

1556
02:13:03,670 --> 02:13:09,939
I don't think they did. What does this game have

1557
02:13:09,939 --> 02:13:25,819
for a score?

1558
02:13:25,819 --> 02:13:33,239
It's just

1559
02:13:33,239 --> 02:13:35,239
balance beam the video game.

1560
02:13:35,239 --> 02:13:42,659
No customizable monkeys?

1561
02:13:42,659 --> 02:13:57,319
Fucking shit.

1562
02:13:57,319 --> 02:13:59,819
Your mama didn't beat this game?

1563
02:13:59,819 --> 02:14:02,819
No. My mother probably couldn't

1564
02:14:02,819 --> 02:14:04,819
get through 1-1 on Mario.

1565
02:14:04,819 --> 02:14:07,640
She didn't even care.

1566
02:14:07,640 --> 02:14:09,939
I think my mother's played

1567
02:14:09,939 --> 02:14:23,829
three video games in her entire life.

1568
02:14:23,829 --> 02:14:25,829
Jesus.

1569
02:14:25,829 --> 02:14:27,829
I have to balance.

1570
02:14:27,829 --> 02:14:31,479
It's not even

1571
02:14:31,479 --> 02:14:33,479
supposed to be a broken game. It's running fast and slides.

1572
02:14:49,539 --> 02:14:54,920
Mario slide game, yeah.

1573
02:14:54,920 --> 02:14:56,920
Doctors play this game before surgery?

1574
02:14:56,920 --> 02:15:02,810
It's hard to watch. It's hard to play too.

1575
02:15:02,810 --> 02:15:04,810
Incredibly

1576
02:15:04,810 --> 02:15:06,810
hard to play.

1577
02:15:06,810 --> 02:15:26,819
The fuck?

1578
02:15:31,109 --> 02:15:33,109
This is the first medical exam you have to do?

1579
02:15:33,109 --> 02:15:40,340
Stay on it.

1580
02:15:40,340 --> 02:15:49,300
Jesus Christ.

1581
02:15:49,300 --> 02:15:51,300
Slow down.

1582
02:15:51,300 --> 02:15:54,119
Holy fuck.

1583
02:15:54,119 --> 02:16:18,250
Holy.

1584
02:16:18,250 --> 02:16:20,250
I might just pivot to brushing my teeth on screen.

1585
02:16:20,250 --> 02:16:44,229
Until they're raw.

1586
02:16:44,229 --> 02:16:46,229
You gotta keep them like right in the center.

1587
02:16:46,229 --> 02:16:53,590
Easy.

1588
02:16:53,590 --> 02:16:55,590
Easy.

1589
02:16:55,590 --> 02:17:00,840
Easy.

1590
02:17:00,840 --> 02:17:29,959
Imagine picking

1591
02:17:29,959 --> 02:17:32,200
anything besides 0.5.

1592
02:17:32,200 --> 02:17:35,590
I don't know how you do

1593
02:17:35,590 --> 02:17:39,430
anything besides 0.5.

1594
02:17:39,430 --> 02:17:41,430
What the fuck just happened? Don't even fucking tell me

1595
02:17:41,430 --> 02:17:46,420
everything crashed.

1596
02:17:46,420 --> 02:18:00,889
I need these bananas.

1597
02:18:00,889 --> 02:18:04,340
Alright, so if I make it halfway,

1598
02:18:04,340 --> 02:18:06,340
do I get to clock out my gamer card?

1599
02:18:06,340 --> 02:18:18,229
No?

1600
02:18:18,229 --> 02:18:21,049
What's Aspect Ratio doing?

1601
02:18:21,049 --> 02:18:23,049
Water levels really just fuck up everything on the graphics.

1602
02:18:26,120 --> 02:18:32,010
What the hell is this?

1603
02:18:32,010 --> 02:18:47,750
You're right.

1604
02:18:47,750 --> 02:18:49,750
This technically is a slide map. You're right.

1605
02:18:49,750 --> 02:18:53,530
I'm gonna hold back on the

1606
02:18:53,530 --> 02:18:58,579
controller. I don't want to go too fast.

1607
02:18:58,579 --> 02:19:05,819
But then I can't see.

1608
02:19:05,819 --> 02:19:08,180
Damn it. It's okay. I'm still alive.

1609
02:19:08,180 --> 02:19:19,059
I'm off along. Stay right in the middle.

1610
02:19:19,059 --> 02:19:23,350
What was wrong with that? What the fuck happened?

1611
02:19:23,350 --> 02:19:25,590
That was okay. What happened there?

1612
02:19:25,590 --> 02:19:35,000
I went right through it.

1613
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:45,500
Holy shit, man.

1614
02:19:45,500 --> 02:19:54,520
You can fall off the side too.

1615
02:19:54,520 --> 02:19:59,579
That sucks. Oh my god.

1616
02:20:02,200 --> 02:20:24,709
Don't move. Don't move.

1617
02:20:24,709 --> 02:20:26,709
50 floors.

1618
02:20:26,709 --> 02:20:28,709
There's 50 of these.

1619
02:20:28,709 --> 02:20:33,239
50?

1620
02:20:33,239 --> 02:20:35,989
Probably can't just sit there, right?

1621
02:20:35,989 --> 02:20:41,620
It's a waste of time. Shit.

1622
02:20:41,620 --> 02:20:54,739
The camera really fucks with me too.

1623
02:20:54,739 --> 02:20:57,180
The camera only moves if you move

1624
02:20:57,180 --> 02:20:59,180
your body. And if you have to turn.

1625
02:20:59,180 --> 02:21:02,950
Like I can't press

1626
02:21:02,950 --> 02:21:04,950
the right stick to move the camera.

1627
02:21:04,950 --> 02:21:08,790
Wait for another cycle. Don't be an idiot.

1628
02:21:08,790 --> 02:21:11,100
You have 30 straight seconds.

1629
02:21:11,100 --> 02:21:21,909
Oh, Jesus. Okay.

1630
02:21:21,909 --> 02:21:23,909
Where am I?

1631
02:21:23,909 --> 02:21:38,170
Are you aware that you're not moving the monkey?

1632
02:21:38,170 --> 02:21:43,989
Jesus blew my mind there, dude.

1633
02:21:43,989 --> 02:21:50,459
I am now.

1634
02:21:50,459 --> 02:22:05,239
Easy here.

1635
02:22:05,239 --> 02:22:07,610
Okay. Fine. Fine. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy.

1636
02:22:07,610 --> 02:22:09,610
Straight. Straight on. Straight on.

1637
02:22:09,610 --> 02:22:12,489
You fucking stupid idiot.

1638
02:22:12,489 --> 02:22:23,430
What? What?

1639
02:22:23,430 --> 02:22:25,430
What happened?

1640
02:22:25,430 --> 02:22:27,860
What was that wrong?

1641
02:22:27,860 --> 02:22:29,860
Am I not going fast enough?

1642
02:22:29,860 --> 02:22:42,020
I mean, I don't have a jump.

1643
02:22:42,020 --> 02:22:49,059
I'm starting to tilt.

1644
02:22:49,059 --> 02:22:51,430
I can't tilt right now. Relax.

1645
02:22:51,430 --> 02:23:05,000
Don't tilt. Just play.

1646
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,239
We're good. That saved a bunch of time

1647
02:23:07,239 --> 02:23:23,370
right there.

1648
02:23:23,370 --> 02:23:25,370
Why?

1649
02:23:25,370 --> 02:23:27,370
You have to

1650
02:23:27,370 --> 02:23:29,370
go so fast. You can't go that fast.

1651
02:23:29,370 --> 02:23:31,370
How many times?

1652
02:23:31,370 --> 02:23:49,270
Press the jump.

1653
02:23:49,270 --> 02:23:51,270
There is no jump.

1654
02:23:51,270 --> 02:23:53,270
How many times do we have to go over this?

1655
02:23:53,270 --> 02:23:55,510
There's no jump button.

1656
02:24:00,420 --> 02:24:02,420
You gotta hold the

1657
02:24:02,420 --> 02:24:04,420
ground down while you go.

1658
02:24:04,420 --> 02:24:09,420
This sucks.

1659
02:24:09,420 --> 02:24:11,420
Let me see what happens. Don't go that fast.

1660
02:24:11,420 --> 02:24:14,299
Go fast enough.

1661
02:24:14,299 --> 02:24:16,299
I got it. I got it. I got it.

1662
02:24:16,299 --> 02:24:19,620
Now what?

1663
02:24:19,620 --> 02:24:21,620
Not fucking around here.

1664
02:24:21,620 --> 02:24:39,979
Inball machine things here?

1665
02:24:39,979 --> 02:24:54,500
I know some of you guys are saying, dude, what the fuck?

1666
02:24:54,500 --> 02:24:56,739
Save states.

1667
02:24:56,739 --> 02:24:58,739
This stream would have ended an hour and a half ago

1668
02:24:58,739 --> 02:25:00,739
to have access to save states.

1669
02:25:00,739 --> 02:25:02,739
Shit, look at all...

1670
02:25:02,739 --> 02:25:19,180
This is so tight.

1671
02:25:19,180 --> 02:25:33,129
Get...

1672
02:25:33,129 --> 02:25:35,129
One of these times you're gonna lose the save state and that's when we

1673
02:25:35,129 --> 02:25:59,700
pivot to something else. AI dungeon?

1674
02:25:59,700 --> 02:26:03,670
Maybe. We'll see.

1675
02:26:03,670 --> 02:26:10,010
I'm still having fun with this.

1676
02:26:10,010 --> 02:26:12,309
God, dude, what the fuck?

1677
02:26:12,309 --> 02:26:14,309
You gotta stay so far on the left.

1678
02:26:14,309 --> 02:26:24,809
Dude, go pee?

1679
02:26:24,809 --> 02:26:30,250
I'm about to grab this ball

1680
02:26:30,250 --> 02:26:32,250
and just chuck it a hundred yards.

1681
02:26:32,250 --> 02:26:34,809
Where's the master hand that can come down

1682
02:26:34,809 --> 02:26:36,809
and grab this ball and just fucking shot put it?

1683
02:26:36,809 --> 02:27:02,600
I feel like

1684
02:27:02,600 --> 02:27:04,600
you guys are talking about the speedrunners that have

1685
02:27:04,600 --> 02:27:06,600
sped around this game that are like, oh yeah, I speedrun this.

1686
02:27:06,600 --> 02:27:11,379
Do they have any teeth left?

1687
02:27:11,379 --> 02:27:21,180
I feel like it's just a mouthful of gums.

1688
02:27:21,180 --> 02:27:23,180
Like just from mashing your teeth down, just grinding them down.

1689
02:27:23,180 --> 02:27:31,500
Gee, sorry.

1690
02:27:31,500 --> 02:27:37,959
They know how to jump for starters.

1691
02:27:37,959 --> 02:27:39,959
I'm gonna press every single button.

1692
02:27:39,959 --> 02:27:45,139
Ready?

1693
02:27:45,139 --> 02:27:48,540
Wait, what? This one's easy.

1694
02:27:48,540 --> 02:28:05,739
Just go straight on.

1695
02:28:05,739 --> 02:28:14,040
There we go.

1696
02:28:14,040 --> 02:28:16,040
Oh man, this one doesn't look fun either.

1697
02:28:16,040 --> 02:28:26,729
God.

1698
02:28:26,729 --> 02:28:29,290
There's 35 flows left.

1699
02:28:29,290 --> 02:28:32,100
I don't think I'm gonna beat this game.

1700
02:28:32,100 --> 02:28:41,959
What about the sticks?

1701
02:28:41,959 --> 02:28:45,610
I did. Let me at least just even see

1702
02:28:45,610 --> 02:28:47,610
what the hell. I think you have to go all the way up

1703
02:28:47,610 --> 02:28:50,040
from corner to corner.

1704
02:28:50,040 --> 02:28:54,569
See what happens. Ready?

1705
02:28:54,569 --> 02:29:05,700
I mean, kind of.

1706
02:29:05,700 --> 02:29:10,500
Holy shit, I have no idea.

1707
02:29:10,500 --> 02:29:12,500
Dude, Monkey Ball 2 is easier and it has

1708
02:29:12,500 --> 02:29:20,760
infinite lives.

1709
02:29:20,760 --> 02:29:22,760
Well, I mean, I'm already in expert mode.

1710
02:29:22,760 --> 02:29:26,149
This way there. You'll know when I'm done.

1711
02:29:26,149 --> 02:29:32,229
I don't get this one.

1712
02:29:32,229 --> 02:29:38,250
Hop across?

1713
02:29:38,250 --> 02:29:43,100
Like, the gap here?

1714
02:29:43,100 --> 02:29:57,180
Holy shit, okay.

1715
02:29:57,180 --> 02:30:01,020
Speedrunners do this game in 25 minutes.

1716
02:30:01,020 --> 02:30:03,020
Yeah, that's insane.

1717
02:30:03,020 --> 02:30:12,229
GTA 4 waiting room.

1718
02:30:12,229 --> 02:30:14,229
What are you talking about? When did I ever say I was gonna play

1719
02:30:14,229 --> 02:30:17,819
GTA 4?

1720
02:30:17,819 --> 02:30:30,299
GTA 4?

1721
02:30:30,299 --> 02:30:40,409
I don't feel like Grim Fandango.

1722
02:30:40,409 --> 02:30:42,649
That's a good old game.

1723
02:30:42,649 --> 02:30:44,649
I played through it a couple times though.

1724
02:30:44,649 --> 02:31:05,299
Shit!

1725
02:31:05,299 --> 02:31:07,299
God, this is gonna make me sick.

1726
02:31:07,299 --> 02:31:18,500
What about The Neverhood?

1727
02:31:18,500 --> 02:31:20,500
I thought about playing The Neverhood a long time ago.

1728
02:31:20,500 --> 02:31:24,459
But this is before

1729
02:31:24,459 --> 02:31:28,040
Armacrog came out.

1730
02:31:28,040 --> 02:31:30,040
I was really excited for Armacrog because Armacrog was

1731
02:31:30,040 --> 02:31:32,040
by the same group that made The Neverhood.

1732
02:31:32,040 --> 02:31:34,280
It was a Kickstarter project.

1733
02:31:34,280 --> 02:31:36,280
And it was okay.

1734
02:31:36,280 --> 02:31:38,579
If I'm honest.

1735
02:31:38,579 --> 02:31:51,299
No!

1736
02:31:51,299 --> 02:31:53,299
It was okay. I don't think they could

1737
02:31:53,299 --> 02:31:55,299
capture the same kind of magic they had with The Neverhood.

1738
02:31:55,299 --> 02:32:06,379
Dude, how do you

1739
02:32:06,379 --> 02:32:08,379
turn the game board sideways

1740
02:32:08,379 --> 02:32:10,620
to go through that? How do you go through that thing?

1741
02:32:10,620 --> 02:32:12,979
Did they just turn it sideways

1742
02:32:12,979 --> 02:32:14,979
just to say fuck you, you'll never beat the game?

1743
02:32:14,979 --> 02:32:32,760
This is a...

1744
02:32:32,760 --> 02:32:35,899
What is this? Okay, this one looks awesome.

1745
02:32:35,899 --> 02:32:44,219
We unlocked a mini game.

1746
02:32:44,219 --> 02:32:52,260
Ooh!

1747
02:32:52,260 --> 02:32:57,059
Let's check that out. I'm gonna piss.

1748
02:32:57,059 --> 02:36:01,579
I gotta pee.

1749
02:36:01,579 --> 02:36:06,629
Alright, I'm good. Got some water?

1750
02:36:06,629 --> 02:36:09,639
Happy birthday! Hey, thanks a lot.

1751
02:36:09,639 --> 02:36:12,260
I appreciate that. Oh, by the way,

1752
02:36:12,260 --> 02:36:14,260
I'm not doing a

1753
02:36:14,260 --> 02:36:17,209
birthday stream.

1754
02:36:17,209 --> 02:36:19,829
I'm gonna take

1755
02:36:19,829 --> 02:36:21,829
tomorrow and probably the next day off.

1756
02:36:21,829 --> 02:36:25,989
I'll be back on Thursday of this week.

1757
02:36:25,989 --> 02:36:28,299
Thursday and Friday are gonna be

1758
02:36:28,299 --> 02:36:30,659
interesting because Thursday,

1759
02:36:30,659 --> 02:36:33,159
the Left 4 Dead 2

1760
02:36:33,159 --> 02:36:35,159
new community campaign

1761
02:36:35,159 --> 02:36:38,229
thing comes out. Gonna be playing that

1762
02:36:38,229 --> 02:36:40,729
with Joel

1763
02:36:40,729 --> 02:36:43,350
Tyler from Valve News

1764
02:36:43,350 --> 02:36:45,350
Network and Simple Flips.

1765
02:36:45,350 --> 02:36:48,170
That's sort of the plan tentatively right now.

1766
02:36:48,170 --> 02:36:51,940
I'm kind of rusty at Left 4 Dead, but I think I still got it.

1767
02:36:51,940 --> 02:36:55,139
And then on Friday,

1768
02:36:55,139 --> 02:36:57,829
Friday of this week,

1769
02:36:57,829 --> 02:36:59,829
I'm gonna be a guest on

1770
02:36:59,829 --> 02:37:01,829
Kitboga's stream.

1771
02:37:01,829 --> 02:37:10,780
I'll be messing around for a couple of hours.

1772
02:37:10,780 --> 02:37:15,770
That should be fun too. I don't know what the

1773
02:37:15,770 --> 02:37:17,770
exact plan is, but I just know that that's

1774
02:37:17,770 --> 02:37:23,270
gonna happen. It's a double pog

1775
02:37:23,270 --> 02:37:26,409
moment, yeah. Well, thanks for the birthday wishes.

1776
02:37:26,409 --> 02:37:28,409
I've seen some of the things people are already making.

1777
02:37:28,409 --> 02:37:32,920
It means a lot. Thank you.

1778
02:37:32,920 --> 02:37:34,920
But yeah, no stream as of tomorrow

1779
02:37:34,920 --> 02:37:37,670
or the next day. I'll be back Thursday

1780
02:37:37,670 --> 02:37:42,409
and then Friday. I'll probably stream on Saturday too.

1781
02:37:42,409 --> 02:37:44,409
Let's keep going. What happened? Where is it?

1782
02:37:44,409 --> 02:37:49,459
Did the game crash?

1783
02:37:49,459 --> 02:37:52,149
Yeah, it's crashed. When was the last state?

1784
02:37:52,149 --> 02:38:00,600
I don't know. Oh yeah, Left 4 Dead should be

1785
02:38:00,600 --> 02:38:02,780
fun. It's been a very long time since I

1786
02:38:02,780 --> 02:38:14,420
played it. That link is funny.

1787
02:38:14,420 --> 02:38:21,510
Is it?

1788
02:38:21,510 --> 02:38:27,340
Alright, let me slow down here.

1789
02:38:27,340 --> 02:38:29,340
Don't go that fast. Alright, you go much

1790
02:38:29,340 --> 02:38:33,559
faster than the thing spins.

1791
02:38:33,559 --> 02:38:35,559
AI dungeon?

1792
02:38:35,559 --> 02:38:38,059
Give me another minute. Still not done.

1793
02:38:38,059 --> 02:38:45,079
Jesus.

1794
02:38:45,079 --> 02:38:47,079
I don't think it should be happening like this.

1795
02:38:47,079 --> 02:38:50,729
I don't think it's supposed to be like this.

1796
02:38:50,729 --> 02:38:52,729
Wait, am I supposed to switch sides?

1797
02:38:52,729 --> 02:38:55,479
Oh, okay.

1798
02:38:55,479 --> 02:38:58,489
I get it. I'm going

1799
02:38:58,489 --> 02:39:01,940
the wrong way. Oh man,

1800
02:39:01,940 --> 02:39:11,670
that's gonna be so hard.

1801
02:39:11,670 --> 02:39:13,670
Okay, you gotta get in each individual

1802
02:39:13,670 --> 02:39:17,959
thing. This is tricky.

1803
02:39:17,959 --> 02:39:30,100
Ugh. Happy 39th

1804
02:39:30,100 --> 02:39:32,100
birthday? Not that old. Not

1805
02:39:32,100 --> 02:39:37,030
that old. Close though.

1806
02:39:37,030 --> 02:39:41,180
You are close.

1807
02:39:41,180 --> 02:39:47,829
Fucking game crashed again. 45?

1808
02:39:47,829 --> 02:40:06,579
No, not 45.

1809
02:40:06,579 --> 02:40:08,579
This is my own fault. I keep doing it to myself.

1810
02:40:08,579 --> 02:40:10,579
But, you know, anything to get through expert,

1811
02:40:10,579 --> 02:40:12,579
right? Anything.

1812
02:40:12,579 --> 02:40:17,260
It'll do anything to get through expert.

1813
02:40:17,260 --> 02:40:29,850
Where's the save?

1814
02:40:29,850 --> 02:40:43,420
No, not gonna happen. Get in it!

1815
02:40:43,420 --> 02:40:45,420
What the fuck, dude?

1816
02:40:45,420 --> 02:40:55,719
Are you looking both ways before

1817
02:40:55,719 --> 02:40:57,719
you cross the fucking road?

1818
02:40:57,719 --> 02:41:13,139
Ugh. I would've

1819
02:41:13,139 --> 02:41:15,139
already eaten the controller if I was 13 and I played

1820
02:41:15,139 --> 02:41:17,510
this. The controller would've been part of

1821
02:41:17,510 --> 02:41:19,510
a fucking soup. I would've chopped it up

1822
02:41:19,510 --> 02:41:21,510
into a bunch of pieces and put it into my stew.

1823
02:41:21,510 --> 02:41:40,329
Come on, dude.

1824
02:41:40,329 --> 02:41:53,639
What the fuck?

1825
02:41:53,639 --> 02:42:17,059
No! Stupid!

1826
02:42:17,059 --> 02:42:20,840
Ugh.

1827
02:42:20,840 --> 02:42:22,840
It's not- I already- It's already- I already blew it. If I blew it,

1828
02:42:22,840 --> 02:42:39,739
it's already over. I keep going backwards

1829
02:42:39,739 --> 02:42:41,739
because the save state was done and crashed

1830
02:42:41,739 --> 02:42:56,059
the game. Get in there! Gotta

1831
02:42:56,059 --> 02:42:58,059
reach into the diaper and get some quarters.

1832
02:42:58,059 --> 02:43:00,870
I do agree with you. That would be fucked up if I reached

1833
02:43:00,870 --> 02:43:02,870
into my diaper to get quarters.

1834
02:43:02,870 --> 02:43:05,299
But,

1835
02:43:05,299 --> 02:43:07,299
would it really be that big of a deal? If it was

1836
02:43:07,299 --> 02:43:18,629
over the pants?

1837
02:43:21,260 --> 02:43:32,250
Come on!

1838
02:43:32,250 --> 02:43:50,979
Alright, how do you- How the fuck you do this one?

1839
02:43:50,979 --> 02:43:54,889
It just dumps you.

1840
02:43:54,889 --> 02:44:07,180
Stay in the middle?

1841
02:44:07,180 --> 02:44:16,629
No, that's not gonna work.

1842
02:44:16,629 --> 02:44:18,629
Right up the side? Yeah, that's what I was trying to do before.

1843
02:44:18,629 --> 02:44:24,969
Just holding left?

1844
02:44:24,969 --> 02:44:40,649
Go slower?

1845
02:44:40,649 --> 02:44:42,649
I don't think it's slower. That wouldn't-

1846
02:44:42,649 --> 02:44:47,450
I can't- It's not gonna go slower.

1847
02:44:47,450 --> 02:44:51,100
Built the stage with the other

1848
02:44:51,100 --> 02:44:53,100
analog? I don't think that works.

1849
02:44:53,100 --> 02:45:03,190
Stay on it!

1850
02:45:03,190 --> 02:45:11,510
I just heard a crunch and I don't know

1851
02:45:11,510 --> 02:45:25,530
what it was. I'm trying to stay all the

1852
02:45:25,530 --> 02:45:27,530
way to the left, but it just dumps you.

1853
02:45:27,530 --> 02:45:40,120
Stay...

1854
02:45:40,120 --> 02:45:42,120
But if I get on the edge, it just falls off.

1855
02:45:42,120 --> 02:45:44,739
I can't even get on it.

1856
02:45:44,739 --> 02:45:54,090
Okay, it just- What happened there?

1857
02:45:54,090 --> 02:45:56,329
Why did he flip over? You don't-

1858
02:45:56,329 --> 02:46:06,440
You can't fall down and

1859
02:46:06,440 --> 02:46:13,159
tilt the GameCube.

1860
02:46:13,159 --> 02:46:15,159
Don't ever push right? I- I haven't once.

1861
02:46:15,159 --> 02:46:18,040
I'm only holding

1862
02:46:18,040 --> 02:46:20,409
up or left. Like I'm holding

1863
02:46:20,409 --> 02:46:27,959
left right now.

1864
02:46:27,959 --> 02:46:34,040
Hold right instead.

1865
02:46:34,040 --> 02:46:47,420
I'll try right side. You think it's broken?

1866
02:46:47,420 --> 02:46:49,420
I don't think so. I think it's just- I don't know.

1867
02:46:49,420 --> 02:46:59,379
I think it's just being weird.

1868
02:46:59,379 --> 02:47:01,379
Why do they- Is there a secret exit behind

1869
02:47:01,379 --> 02:47:03,379
the start? Sure there is.

1870
02:47:03,379 --> 02:47:05,379
Why did I listen to you?

1871
02:47:05,379 --> 02:47:08,649
There's nothing here.

1872
02:47:08,649 --> 02:47:13,639
You're lying.

1873
02:47:13,639 --> 02:47:19,020
You have to tilt

1874
02:47:19,020 --> 02:47:21,020
right or tilt left?

1875
02:47:21,020 --> 02:47:24,469
Like in the movie Cars?

1876
02:47:24,469 --> 02:47:27,219
Cars?

1877
02:47:27,219 --> 02:47:38,040
What are you talking about?

1878
02:47:38,040 --> 02:47:41,819
You remember in the movie Cars when

1879
02:47:41,819 --> 02:47:44,500
when

1880
02:47:44,500 --> 02:47:47,639
Flash Lightning

1881
02:47:47,639 --> 02:47:49,639
goes over the tutorial of how to play Monkey

1882
02:47:49,639 --> 02:47:55,979
Ball? Turn right

1883
02:47:55,979 --> 02:47:58,469
to go left.

1884
02:47:58,469 --> 02:48:01,860
You don't understand.

1885
02:48:01,860 --> 02:48:07,299
I can't go

1886
02:48:07,299 --> 02:48:09,299
faster. There is no faster.

1887
02:48:09,299 --> 02:48:11,299
Look at the real estate that I have.

1888
02:48:11,299 --> 02:48:13,299
I can't feel the speed here.

1889
02:48:13,299 --> 02:48:25,530
We tried to stop going full about just pushing

1890
02:48:25,530 --> 02:48:27,530
left. That's actually a good call.

1891
02:48:27,530 --> 02:48:30,659
That's not a bad idea.

1892
02:48:30,659 --> 02:48:32,659
Just hold right.

1893
02:48:32,659 --> 02:48:34,659
That might actually work.

1894
02:48:34,659 --> 02:48:42,729
Hold on.

1895
02:48:42,729 --> 02:48:49,260
I think you really do just have to

1896
02:48:49,260 --> 02:48:51,260
stay right on the edge here.

1897
02:48:51,260 --> 02:48:53,260
Once it starts to go that far up you just

1898
02:48:53,260 --> 02:48:55,260
can't go anywhere.

1899
02:48:55,260 --> 02:49:02,860
Start on the lower side and move

1900
02:49:02,860 --> 02:49:04,860
forward and towards the higher side to have

1901
02:49:04,860 --> 02:49:06,860
momentum upwards.

1902
02:49:06,860 --> 02:49:09,420
Like slide down and then up.

1903
02:49:09,420 --> 02:49:11,420
This is too much for my fucking

1904
02:49:11,420 --> 02:49:13,420
toddler brain to do.

1905
02:49:15,420 --> 02:49:38,579
Can you surf like a wave?

1906
02:49:38,579 --> 02:49:43,260
I don't know.

1907
02:49:43,260 --> 02:49:45,260
You can flip the board over if you stay on one side

1908
02:49:45,260 --> 02:49:47,260
then it will stay flat.

1909
02:49:47,260 --> 02:49:52,629
How much time does it actually take to go through the whole

1910
02:49:52,629 --> 02:49:54,629
cycle here?

1911
02:49:54,629 --> 02:49:56,809
See what happens?

1912
02:49:56,809 --> 02:49:58,809
It goes like dump!

1913
02:49:58,809 --> 02:50:00,809
Right at the end. There's like a little dump at the end.

1914
02:50:00,809 --> 02:50:03,559
There's a little more momentum right like at the end.

1915
02:50:03,559 --> 02:50:14,950
I picked the worst character

1916
02:50:14,950 --> 02:50:18,409
for this. I didn't know that the Monkey

1917
02:50:18,409 --> 02:50:20,409
Ball characters had different stats.

1918
02:50:20,409 --> 02:50:22,409
Isn't that not even right?

1919
02:50:22,409 --> 02:50:32,520
See if I try to pull

1920
02:50:32,520 --> 02:50:34,520
hard left.

1921
02:50:34,520 --> 02:50:36,520
It just doesn't matter. You go over or

1922
02:50:36,520 --> 02:50:42,600
it dumps you anyways. Just watch the speed

1923
02:50:42,600 --> 02:50:44,600
run. No, I don't want to be embarrassed.

1924
02:50:44,600 --> 02:51:01,879
Use the speed run strat.

1925
02:51:01,879 --> 02:51:04,819
What's the speed run strat?

1926
02:51:04,819 --> 02:51:08,729
I'm curious.

1927
02:51:08,729 --> 02:51:10,729
I feel like this one, I don't understand this.

1928
02:51:10,729 --> 02:51:13,350
Yeah.

1929
02:51:13,350 --> 02:51:15,350
So funny. You're making me

1930
02:51:15,350 --> 02:51:17,350
cry laughing right now.

1931
02:51:17,350 --> 02:51:19,350
It's absolutely hysterical

1932
02:51:19,350 --> 02:51:24,979
to me.

1933
02:51:24,979 --> 02:51:26,979
It is. Okay, it is. I'll be honest with you.

1934
02:51:26,979 --> 02:51:28,979
It is. It was pretty funny.

1935
02:51:28,979 --> 02:51:39,979
Shit. You're doing the same

1936
02:51:39,979 --> 02:51:41,979
thing over and over and you're expecting different results.

1937
02:51:41,979 --> 02:51:45,620
What else

1938
02:51:45,620 --> 02:51:49,079
am I supposed to do?

1939
02:51:49,079 --> 02:51:51,079
I'm trying to just hold. You can't.

1940
02:51:51,079 --> 02:51:53,079
I think this is

1941
02:51:53,079 --> 02:51:57,940
the end of the game. What if

1942
02:51:57,940 --> 02:51:59,940
I don't move at all and just hold left?

1943
02:51:59,940 --> 02:52:05,430
No.

1944
02:52:05,430 --> 02:52:09,020
Actually just stay in the middle.

1945
02:52:09,020 --> 02:52:11,020
Yeah, you can't though.

1946
02:52:11,020 --> 02:52:19,979
I feel like I almost had it.

1947
02:52:19,979 --> 02:52:30,649
Give me the link.

1948
02:52:30,649 --> 02:52:32,649
See how to beat this dumbass level. How do I beat it?

1949
02:52:32,649 --> 02:52:36,229
Super Monkey Ball. Expert 18.

1950
02:52:36,229 --> 02:52:38,409
Okay.

1951
02:52:38,409 --> 02:52:44,040
What the fuck is going on here?

1952
02:52:44,040 --> 02:52:51,829
Okay, so he, it's when

1953
02:52:51,829 --> 02:52:53,829
it starts to tilt over to the right.

1954
02:52:53,829 --> 02:52:55,829
He runs down

1955
02:52:55,829 --> 02:52:57,829
and then, let me try this

1956
02:52:57,829 --> 02:53:08,629
shit.

1957
02:53:08,629 --> 02:53:10,629
It's right when it starts to go down and then starts to move up again.

1958
02:53:10,629 --> 02:53:13,639
Here we go, like now. Fuck you.

1959
02:53:13,639 --> 02:53:21,829
You have to catch it like when it's coming back up.

1960
02:53:21,829 --> 02:53:25,989
Like,

1961
02:53:25,989 --> 02:53:29,319
now. No, I don't,

1962
02:53:29,319 --> 02:53:31,319
I'm doing what he's doing. I'm doing what he's doing.

1963
02:53:31,319 --> 02:53:36,309
It doesn't work. Okay, by the way,

1964
02:53:36,309 --> 02:53:38,309
the video starts like, he's

1965
02:53:38,309 --> 02:53:43,940
in the middle of doing something already.

1966
02:53:43,940 --> 02:53:45,940
He's like already on the move when the video starts.

1967
02:53:45,940 --> 02:53:48,819
He's already got like a bunch of speed.

1968
02:53:48,819 --> 02:54:04,440
Oh, what's the video?

1969
02:54:04,440 --> 02:54:06,440
All right, hey, look.

1970
02:54:06,440 --> 02:54:08,440
Watch, there's still a lot of rushes.

1971
02:54:08,440 --> 02:54:24,870
Check this out.

1972
02:54:24,870 --> 02:54:30,120
Like all the ads.

1973
02:54:30,120 --> 02:54:39,020
What am I doing wrong?

1974
02:54:39,020 --> 02:54:41,020
What did I just delete?

1975
02:54:41,020 --> 02:54:43,020
I just deleted something on my browser.

1976
02:54:43,020 --> 02:54:46,340
Oh, no, I deleted

1977
02:54:46,340 --> 02:54:52,040
the game.

1978
02:54:52,040 --> 02:54:54,040
I'm so fucking angry.

1979
02:54:54,040 --> 02:55:00,700
Hold on.

1980
02:55:00,700 --> 02:55:14,899
I'm pivoting to AI Dungeon.

1981
02:55:14,899 --> 02:55:16,899
I'm done. I'm done with it. I'm done with this game.

1982
02:55:16,899 --> 02:55:21,639
I'm done with this one.

1983
02:55:21,639 --> 02:55:36,600
Twitter, you get to see this.

1984
02:55:36,600 --> 02:55:39,159
They're spying on me. Get out of here.

1985
02:55:39,159 --> 02:56:04,700
That's what he did in the video.

1986
02:56:04,700 --> 02:56:07,059
That's what he did in the video.

1987
02:56:07,059 --> 02:56:10,440
He went like,

1988
02:56:10,440 --> 02:56:21,700
do a different monkey.

1989
02:56:21,700 --> 02:56:24,389
But how?

1990
02:56:24,389 --> 02:56:27,530
I have to quit the game.

1991
02:56:27,530 --> 02:56:29,530
How do we use a different monkey? That's stupid.

1992
02:56:29,530 --> 02:56:31,530
What, I go through half the game and then it's like,

1993
02:56:31,530 --> 02:56:33,530
well, sorry, you weren't the monkey you needed

1994
02:56:33,530 --> 02:56:41,979
to be this time.

1995
02:56:41,979 --> 02:56:55,860
Mangan is the worst.

1996
02:56:55,860 --> 02:57:08,219
This is literally a disinformation

1997
02:57:08,219 --> 02:57:13,909
campaign.

1998
02:57:13,909 --> 02:57:16,659
I came

1999
02:57:16,659 --> 02:57:18,659
here for monkey ball, not monkey bitch.

2000
02:57:18,659 --> 02:57:20,659
Okay, that person deserves a timeout.

2001
02:57:20,659 --> 02:57:22,659
I want that person to get a timeout.

2002
02:57:22,659 --> 02:57:24,659
Like for ten minutes.

2003
02:57:24,659 --> 02:57:27,159
That person deserves at least a five

2004
02:57:27,159 --> 02:57:29,159
minute quiet period.

2005
02:57:29,159 --> 02:57:40,489
It's alright. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.

2006
02:57:40,489 --> 02:57:44,520
I'm gonna be fine. I'm gonna be...

2007
02:57:44,520 --> 02:57:53,350
No, I'm not.

2008
02:57:53,350 --> 02:58:06,979
You fucker.

2009
02:58:06,979 --> 02:58:13,829
Okay, here we go. That's it. That's it. That was almost it.

2010
02:58:13,829 --> 02:58:15,829
That was close. That was really, really close.

2011
02:58:15,829 --> 02:58:19,100
You gotta catch it

2012
02:58:19,100 --> 02:58:21,100
at the exact moment that it starts to come on

2013
02:58:21,100 --> 02:58:23,100
the momentum to go down to up.

2014
02:58:23,100 --> 02:58:26,680
Right now.

2015
02:58:26,680 --> 02:58:30,139
Stupid game.

2016
02:58:30,139 --> 02:58:37,180
No, you stupid game.

2017
02:58:37,180 --> 02:59:20,420
Come on!

2018
02:59:20,420 --> 02:59:22,420
Dude, that's... How the fuck do you

2019
02:59:22,420 --> 02:59:32,600
do this shit? Dude, was this like Mario

2020
02:59:32,600 --> 02:59:34,600
Maker? Did anyone in the office beat this level?

2021
02:59:34,600 --> 02:59:37,100
Or did they just make it and go,

2022
02:59:37,100 --> 02:59:39,659
that looks good. Did anybody do it?

2023
02:59:39,659 --> 02:59:50,920
No. Looks good though.

2024
02:59:50,920 --> 02:59:56,809
Put a hand cam on.

2025
02:59:56,809 --> 02:59:58,809
I'm not gonna put on a hand cam.

2026
02:59:58,809 --> 03:00:27,799
Hand cam tutorial

2027
03:00:27,799 --> 03:00:35,350
for this level.

2028
03:00:35,350 --> 03:00:38,809
You're not serious, are you? Are you fucking

2029
03:00:38,809 --> 03:00:45,340
kidding me?

2030
03:00:45,340 --> 03:00:47,340
This shit don't happen in my game.

2031
03:00:47,340 --> 03:00:49,340
This shit doesn't happen in my game.

2032
03:00:49,340 --> 03:00:52,790
I just fly off the edge.

2033
03:00:52,790 --> 03:00:57,079
I just fly

2034
03:00:57,079 --> 03:00:59,079
off the edge.

2035
03:00:59,079 --> 03:01:01,079
Okay, I'm gonna do exactly what this person...

2036
03:01:01,079 --> 03:01:03,079
So they land immediately when it's flat.

2037
03:01:03,079 --> 03:01:05,510
They go to the right. They tilt.

2038
03:01:05,510 --> 03:01:07,510
They stay on the right side. I've already been off the

2039
03:01:07,510 --> 03:01:14,360
left edge, by the way, at this point.

2040
03:01:14,360 --> 03:01:46,620
There we go. There is no

2041
03:01:46,620 --> 03:02:09,659
jump.

2042
03:02:09,659 --> 03:02:11,659
I'm trying to tilt with the...

2043
03:02:11,659 --> 03:02:14,790
You have to bind a key to jump.

2044
03:02:14,790 --> 03:02:30,920
I'm gonna freak out.

2045
03:02:30,920 --> 03:02:32,920
Dude, I'm holding up, holding le...

2046
03:02:32,920 --> 03:02:34,920
I don't matter. I'm tilting. I'm...

2047
03:02:34,920 --> 03:02:36,920
I'm finessing.

2048
03:02:36,920 --> 03:02:38,920
I'm tilting.

2049
03:02:38,920 --> 03:02:40,920
I'm tilting.

2050
03:02:40,920 --> 03:02:42,920
I fell off the fucking edge, dude.

2051
03:02:42,920 --> 03:03:05,319
All the way to the right.

2052
03:03:05,319 --> 03:03:07,750
Okay, I'm gonna do this frame by frame.

2053
03:03:07,750 --> 03:03:11,530
They're not even touching any button.

2054
03:03:11,530 --> 03:03:13,530
They're holding right. Okay, that's what I was doing.

2055
03:03:13,530 --> 03:03:15,899
And then they hold left

2056
03:03:15,899 --> 03:03:17,899
when it moves. Yeah, that's exactly what I'm

2057
03:03:17,899 --> 03:03:42,340
trying to do. I was gonna do the...

2058
03:03:42,340 --> 03:03:44,340
Okay, ready? Just go right. Do exactly what

2059
03:03:44,340 --> 03:04:19,340
they do.

2060
03:04:19,340 --> 03:04:21,340
I'm about to just rip the fucking

2061
03:04:21,340 --> 03:04:23,340
power button off of my computer.

2062
03:04:23,340 --> 03:04:41,639
You should hit triangle

2063
03:04:41,639 --> 03:04:44,969
to grind.

2064
03:04:44,969 --> 03:04:50,459
You have to go fast.

2065
03:04:50,459 --> 03:04:52,889
I'm trying to hold

2066
03:04:52,889 --> 03:04:55,129
left. Hold right.

2067
03:04:55,129 --> 03:04:58,459
I didn't even...

2068
03:04:58,459 --> 03:05:00,459
This is so ridiculous.

2069
03:05:00,459 --> 03:05:02,459
I didn't even mean to do that this time.

2070
03:05:02,459 --> 03:05:06,469
Hold left.

2071
03:05:06,469 --> 03:05:08,469
Okay, I don't fucking know. I can't do

2072
03:05:08,469 --> 03:05:11,540
anything else.

2073
03:05:11,540 --> 03:05:13,540
What do you mean, finally listen? That's what I've been trying

2074
03:05:13,540 --> 03:05:15,540
to do this entire time.

2075
03:05:15,540 --> 03:05:37,110
No, you piece of shit.

2076
03:05:37,110 --> 03:05:46,010
Alright, I'm jumping off and I'm holding

2077
03:05:46,010 --> 03:05:49,909
left and forward at the same time.

2078
03:05:49,909 --> 03:05:51,909
If I do that too quickly, I fall off.

2079
03:05:51,909 --> 03:06:10,260
It's dumping me.

2080
03:06:10,260 --> 03:06:13,270
Tilting. Just go forward.

2081
03:06:13,270 --> 03:06:15,270
It's not gonna do anything.

2082
03:06:15,270 --> 03:06:21,670
Just cap

2083
03:06:21,670 --> 03:06:23,670
the FPS. What do you mean, cap the FPS?

2084
03:06:23,670 --> 03:06:26,229
What?

2085
03:06:26,229 --> 03:06:38,899
Don't slow down. Guys, I am

2086
03:06:38,899 --> 03:06:41,530
holding forward.

2087
03:06:41,530 --> 03:06:43,530
I'm not hitting back at all. I'm

2088
03:06:43,530 --> 03:06:45,530
only going forward or left.

2089
03:06:45,530 --> 03:06:49,239
I'm not tilting the controller back.

2090
03:06:49,239 --> 03:07:02,680
Why do you think I'm doing that?

2091
03:07:02,680 --> 03:07:04,680
Try doing it backwards.

2092
03:07:04,680 --> 03:07:10,500
This is insane.

2093
03:07:10,500 --> 03:07:18,680
Imagine needing to do this

2094
03:07:18,680 --> 03:07:23,670
this many times. Turn the tilt

2095
03:07:23,670 --> 03:07:30,840
controls off. Use the

2096
03:07:30,840 --> 03:07:37,879
keyboard.

2097
03:07:37,879 --> 03:07:49,459
This may be a dumb question, but are you using

2098
03:07:49,459 --> 03:07:51,459
an actual GameCube controller? No.

2099
03:07:51,459 --> 03:08:04,180
I am not. Good luck

2100
03:08:04,180 --> 03:08:06,180
then. What do you mean, good luck then?

2101
03:08:06,180 --> 03:08:13,540
What do you mean?

2102
03:08:13,540 --> 03:08:15,540
What do you mean, good luck then?

2103
03:08:15,540 --> 03:08:27,129
What's that mean?

2104
03:08:27,129 --> 03:08:29,430
That's your problem. What?

2105
03:08:29,430 --> 03:08:31,430
No, it's not. There hasn't been a problem so far.

2106
03:08:31,430 --> 03:08:45,899
How long

2107
03:08:45,899 --> 03:08:47,899
have I been on this level?

2108
03:08:47,899 --> 03:08:49,899
Probably like 35 minutes.

2109
03:08:49,899 --> 03:08:56,040
Start by going left and turn right to get

2110
03:08:56,040 --> 03:08:58,280
momentum.

2111
03:08:58,280 --> 03:09:00,280
If I do that too fast, I just

2112
03:09:00,280 --> 03:09:13,340
go right off.

2113
03:09:13,340 --> 03:09:24,790
I got it, I got it.

2114
03:09:24,790 --> 03:09:26,790
I got it, I got it.

2115
03:09:26,790 --> 03:09:28,790
I know exactly what to do.

2116
03:09:28,790 --> 03:09:30,790
Trust me, I got it. This is fucking the real one

2117
03:09:30,790 --> 03:09:32,790
right here coming up.

2118
03:09:32,790 --> 03:09:35,219
One of these. I know what I have to do.

2119
03:09:35,219 --> 03:09:37,590
Check it out. I'll get it in a

2120
03:09:37,590 --> 03:09:39,590
second. Wait, one second. Give me a second.

2121
03:09:39,590 --> 03:09:45,860
Shit.

2122
03:09:45,860 --> 03:09:57,879
Dude.

2123
03:09:57,879 --> 03:10:11,639
Come on. This is so

2124
03:10:11,639 --> 03:10:21,500
frustrating.

2125
03:10:21,500 --> 03:10:23,860
Just leave this game.

2126
03:10:23,860 --> 03:10:25,860
I can't do that right now. I have to beat this level

2127
03:10:25,860 --> 03:10:46,729
or else I won't be able to go to sleep tonight.

2128
03:10:46,729 --> 03:10:48,729
Is your FPS capped?

2129
03:10:48,729 --> 03:10:52,059
Would that even matter?

2130
03:10:52,059 --> 03:11:11,190
I don't think that would really matter.

2131
03:11:11,190 --> 03:11:13,190
I feel like the game is just forcing me down the fucking hole.

2132
03:11:13,190 --> 03:11:21,829
Cap the frame rate.

2133
03:11:21,829 --> 03:11:23,829
Cap the frame rate. To what?

2134
03:11:23,829 --> 03:11:29,020
Hey, I'm the one that said, hold on.

2135
03:11:29,020 --> 03:11:31,020
Wait, wait, wait. Hey, I'm the one that said Monkey Ball

2136
03:11:31,020 --> 03:11:33,020
was like Mario Slope Racing.

2137
03:11:33,020 --> 03:11:35,020
I said Monkey Ball 2, not this

2138
03:11:35,020 --> 03:11:40,780
piece of shit.

2139
03:11:40,780 --> 03:11:45,190
Hey, easy.

2140
03:11:45,190 --> 03:11:47,190
Easy.

2141
03:11:47,190 --> 03:11:49,750
Change monkeys for the love of God.

2142
03:11:49,750 --> 03:11:51,750
But that means I have to lose my everything

2143
03:11:51,750 --> 03:12:00,649
here, don't I?

2144
03:12:00,649 --> 03:12:04,420
No. Redo. Who cares?

2145
03:12:04,420 --> 03:12:06,600
Who gives a shit?

2146
03:12:06,600 --> 03:12:10,379
It doesn't matter. It's not the monkey.

2147
03:12:10,379 --> 03:12:23,559
I'm trying to do exactly what the thing does

2148
03:12:23,559 --> 03:12:25,930
in the video.

2149
03:12:25,930 --> 03:12:27,930
They go right here. And it's like boom.

2150
03:12:27,930 --> 03:12:35,860
Now they're tilting a little.

2151
03:12:35,860 --> 03:12:39,450
What did he say?

2152
03:12:39,450 --> 03:12:41,450
FPS cap in Dolphin SMB emulation has been

2153
03:12:41,450 --> 03:12:43,450
bound to cause significant issues down the line towards

2154
03:12:43,450 --> 03:12:45,450
the later half of the advanced levels.

2155
03:12:45,450 --> 03:12:51,579
What?

2156
03:12:51,579 --> 03:12:53,579
Physics are based on frame rate. Cap your frame rate.

2157
03:12:53,579 --> 03:12:58,629
Don't even fucking tell me this is all...

2158
03:12:58,629 --> 03:13:04,389
How do I do that?

2159
03:13:04,389 --> 03:13:09,450
Cap my frame rate?

2160
03:13:09,450 --> 03:13:11,450
How do I do that? Graphics?

2161
03:13:11,450 --> 03:13:14,200
Turn on V-sync?

2162
03:13:14,200 --> 03:13:28,899
How do I do that? V-sync.

2163
03:13:28,899 --> 03:13:33,110
Cap it at 30.

2164
03:13:33,110 --> 03:13:36,059
Anti-Ala-sync. He read my

2165
03:13:36,059 --> 03:13:38,059
comment out loud and he ignored it.

2166
03:13:38,059 --> 03:13:42,600
I did? Wait, wait, what do I cap

2167
03:13:42,600 --> 03:13:44,600
frame rate in, uh, fucking

2168
03:13:44,600 --> 03:13:46,600
Senator, uh...

2169
03:13:46,600 --> 03:13:51,909
Swordfish. Monkey Ball ran

2170
03:13:51,909 --> 03:13:58,299
at 30.

2171
03:13:58,299 --> 03:14:00,299
You ignored it again?

2172
03:14:00,299 --> 03:14:05,989
I didn't ignore it again. I didn't even see it.

2173
03:14:05,989 --> 03:14:10,979
Figuration, hold on. Okay, well how do I do that?

2174
03:14:10,979 --> 03:14:12,979
That's 16x9 gecko code.

2175
03:14:12,979 --> 03:14:14,979
I don't know what the fuck that is.

2176
03:14:14,979 --> 03:14:19,139
Gecko code?

2177
03:14:19,139 --> 03:14:21,319
Floor 18.

2178
03:14:21,319 --> 03:14:23,319
Original Monkey Ball ran at 30. 45

2179
03:14:23,319 --> 03:14:25,319
on LCD and 50 on a screen projector.

2180
03:14:25,319 --> 03:14:30,059
Go back

2181
03:14:30,059 --> 03:14:32,059
for fucking boots. Can somebody just tell me

2182
03:14:32,059 --> 03:14:34,059
what setting, what box

2183
03:14:34,059 --> 03:14:36,229
do I check? Read this!

2184
03:14:36,229 --> 03:14:38,229
The game carried none of the level

2185
03:14:38,229 --> 03:14:40,229
design to the sequel. 2 is a fun

2186
03:14:40,229 --> 03:14:42,229
racing game. This one is a bullshit obstacle course.

2187
03:14:42,229 --> 03:14:45,879
Monkey Ball Torture from Wikipedia,

2188
03:14:45,879 --> 03:14:47,879
the free encyclopedia.org.

2189
03:14:47,879 --> 03:14:49,879
Monkey Ball Torture, what?

2190
03:14:49,879 --> 03:14:56,469
Somebody has a tutorial here?

2191
03:14:56,469 --> 03:15:02,420
Let me see it. Title does not

2192
03:15:02,420 --> 03:15:05,690
need... Alright, I'm just gonna find

2193
03:15:05,690 --> 03:15:08,629
it. How do I cap my frame rate?

2194
03:15:08,629 --> 03:15:16,120
If I get it first try, after this I'm

2195
03:15:16,120 --> 03:15:21,239
gonna laugh my ass off.

2196
03:15:21,239 --> 03:15:28,540
Cap frame rate. Frame

2197
03:15:28,540 --> 03:15:33,579
limiter. Okay?

2198
03:15:33,579 --> 03:15:35,579
I can't seem to find the frame limiter for

2199
03:15:35,579 --> 03:15:37,579
this. Can somebody tell me? It doesn't exist.

2200
03:15:37,579 --> 03:15:41,739
Feature was changed to

2201
03:15:41,739 --> 03:15:43,739
speed limit. Speed limit.

2202
03:15:43,739 --> 03:15:47,260
Okay? Look at the speed

2203
03:15:47,260 --> 03:15:49,260
limit. Speed limit! There it is!

2204
03:15:49,260 --> 03:15:51,260
Alright, so it would be 50%.

2205
03:15:51,260 --> 03:15:54,139
That would be 30 FPS, right?

2206
03:15:54,139 --> 03:16:03,989
Is this the game I'm supposed to run?

2207
03:16:03,989 --> 03:16:11,100
Uh, I think this just

2208
03:16:11,100 --> 03:16:15,579
put it into slow motion.

2209
03:16:40,459 --> 03:16:42,459
Hold on a minute. I...

2210
03:16:42,459 --> 03:16:48,149
I'll get it.

2211
03:17:16,870 --> 03:17:18,870
I can't even do it at 30% speed!

2212
03:17:18,870 --> 03:17:28,729
Oh my god!

2213
03:17:28,729 --> 03:17:44,729
A bunch of drugs.

2214
03:17:44,729 --> 03:17:58,870
You piece of shit!

2215
03:17:58,870 --> 03:18:07,379
What the fuck?

2216
03:18:07,379 --> 03:19:02,860
I'm gonna get it! Get in there.

2217
03:19:02,860 --> 03:19:04,860
Don't go over the edge, little

2218
03:19:04,860 --> 03:19:06,860
guy! No!

2219
03:19:06,860 --> 03:19:40,069
Like, why?

2220
03:19:40,069 --> 03:19:54,790
I'll get it at 50%. I almost had

2221
03:19:54,790 --> 03:20:05,350
it last time. Give me the controller.

2222
03:20:05,350 --> 03:20:07,350
Actually, controller issue. What?

2223
03:20:07,350 --> 03:20:11,190
Read this. Read this. Read. Check. Wait. Wait.

2224
03:20:11,190 --> 03:20:13,190
Read this. Check your modular trombulation.

2225
03:20:13,190 --> 03:20:15,190
Your anti-aliasing is blasted.

2226
03:20:15,190 --> 03:20:17,190
What? Read this. Don't change

2227
03:20:17,190 --> 03:20:19,190
the frame rate. Turn against the

2228
03:20:19,190 --> 03:20:21,190
platform when it tilts. You keep trying to stay

2229
03:20:21,190 --> 03:20:23,190
on the edge the whole time

2230
03:20:23,190 --> 03:20:25,190
and that's why you're falling off. Go to the

2231
03:20:25,190 --> 03:20:27,190
falling side and then ramp back up.

2232
03:20:27,190 --> 03:21:05,770
Alright. Guys!

2233
03:21:05,770 --> 03:21:08,010
Guys! Guys!

2234
03:21:08,010 --> 03:21:10,010
I have to pull a plug. I have to rip the cord

2235
03:21:10,010 --> 03:21:12,010
out. I can't. What am I gonna do this

2236
03:21:12,010 --> 03:21:23,020
all day? You're gonna watch.

2237
03:21:23,020 --> 03:21:25,959
Watch. Watch. Watch. Watch. Watch. Watch. Watch this.

2238
03:21:25,959 --> 03:21:28,840
Watch this. Watch this.

2239
03:21:28,840 --> 03:21:30,840
Irma's Game Cubes. What?

2240
03:21:30,840 --> 03:21:33,850
Oh, okay. Hold on. Let me try one more time.

2241
03:21:33,850 --> 03:21:42,549
Fuck you!

2242
03:21:42,549 --> 03:21:47,930
Please. Please. Please. I'm too-

2243
03:21:47,930 --> 03:21:51,579
The chat is going so fast.

2244
03:21:51,579 --> 03:21:54,899
Sopranos, but-

2245
03:21:54,899 --> 03:21:56,899
It didn't help me.

2246
03:21:56,899 --> 03:21:59,139
It didn't help me. At all.

2247
03:21:59,139 --> 03:22:01,139
Actually. That was the worst-

2248
03:22:01,139 --> 03:22:26,739
That was the least thing that I needed.

2249
03:22:26,739 --> 03:22:36,340
Do it! Please read!

2250
03:22:36,340 --> 03:22:38,340
Tilt to the jump till you

2251
03:22:38,340 --> 03:22:40,340
kick smooth. The north?

2252
03:22:40,340 --> 03:22:59,340
What?

2253
03:22:59,340 --> 03:23:01,340
Watching paint dry. I'm- I'm sorry.

2254
03:23:01,340 --> 03:23:03,340
Trust me. I know. I'm trying to get

2255
03:23:03,340 --> 03:23:11,590
through this. It's tilting and it don't do

2256
03:23:11,590 --> 03:23:23,239
anything, man. Super Monkey Ball.

2257
03:23:23,239 --> 03:23:26,700
Wait. Turn this off or turn this

2258
03:23:26,700 --> 03:23:31,430
down. I need to hear this. Shut this

2259
03:23:31,430 --> 03:23:34,440
off. Somebody has an actual tutorial

2260
03:23:34,440 --> 03:23:41,799
for me. What does it say?

2261
03:23:45,799 --> 03:23:47,799
Cool.

2262
03:23:47,799 --> 03:23:49,799
Please.

2263
03:23:51,799 --> 03:23:53,799
A lot of people make

2264
03:23:53,799 --> 03:23:55,799
their, like, first major mistake is they don't

2265
03:23:55,799 --> 03:23:57,799
pick the right monkey. You need to pick the

2266
03:23:57,799 --> 03:23:59,799
stinky monkey.

2267
03:23:59,799 --> 03:24:02,360
Uh-oh. Stink?

2268
03:24:02,360 --> 03:24:05,180
You fucking

2269
03:24:05,180 --> 03:24:18,870
dick.

2270
03:24:18,870 --> 03:24:20,870
You just made this video.

2271
03:24:20,870 --> 03:24:24,069
Didn't you?

2272
03:24:24,069 --> 03:24:26,069
Hey guys. It's a stavedate from the

2273
03:24:26,069 --> 03:24:28,069
speedrun forums. His name is

2274
03:24:28,069 --> 03:24:30,069
stavedate. Dave state?

2275
03:24:30,069 --> 03:24:33,139
Beginner strats for floor 18.

2276
03:24:33,139 --> 03:24:35,139
So the main thing I see a lot of people

2277
03:24:35,139 --> 03:24:37,700
make their, like, first major

2278
03:24:37,700 --> 03:24:39,700
mistake is they don't pick the right monkey.

2279
03:24:39,700 --> 03:24:41,700
You need to pick the stinky monkey.

2280
03:24:41,700 --> 03:24:56,219
Uh-oh. I need- because somebody please

2281
03:24:56,219 --> 03:24:58,219
tell me how to do it. Like, somebody help me. Please.

2282
03:24:58,219 --> 03:25:01,860
Somebody help me. I want a real tutorial.

2283
03:25:01,860 --> 03:25:05,260
Make one.

2284
03:25:05,260 --> 03:25:12,809
Give me a frame by frame. This is

2285
03:25:12,809 --> 03:25:15,049
expert-

2286
03:25:15,049 --> 03:25:20,870
Okay, hold on. Pick the stinky monkey.

2287
03:25:20,870 --> 03:25:24,840
Let's watch this for a second.

2288
03:25:24,840 --> 03:25:31,860
All the way to the right.

2289
03:25:31,860 --> 03:25:33,860
That's the shit that I'm doing right there, man.

2290
03:25:33,860 --> 03:25:35,860
I'm doing that already.

2291
03:25:35,860 --> 03:25:37,860
He's getting really-

2292
03:25:37,860 --> 03:25:39,860
Okay, alright, alright. He gets all the way to top.

2293
03:25:39,860 --> 03:25:43,059
Like, he's gonna fall the fuck out.

2294
03:25:43,059 --> 03:25:48,950
Shit, this guy's good!

2295
03:25:48,950 --> 03:25:50,950
Holy shit, this guy's

2296
03:25:50,950 --> 03:25:58,569
really good. Hold on.

2297
03:25:58,569 --> 03:26:00,569
I'm so good, actually, now that I'm not

2298
03:26:00,569 --> 03:26:12,469
so good.

2299
03:26:12,469 --> 03:26:16,420
Okay. So, he-

2300
03:26:16,420 --> 03:26:22,629
Volume back up. Okay.

2301
03:26:22,629 --> 03:26:24,629
So he goes bang. He goes right all the way

2302
03:26:24,629 --> 03:26:29,610
to the edge. Just follow.

2303
03:26:29,610 --> 03:26:31,850
T-A-S. T-A-S.

2304
03:26:31,850 --> 03:26:33,850
I thought you were saying T-O-S. Like,

2305
03:26:33,850 --> 03:26:35,850
my dick was on camera. I was like, what the hell are you talking about?

2306
03:26:35,850 --> 03:26:38,149
Alright, I didn't do it. I'll get it.

2307
03:26:38,149 --> 03:26:55,430
T-A-T-T-

2308
03:26:55,430 --> 03:26:57,430
It's tool-assisted.

2309
03:26:57,430 --> 03:26:59,430
Whatever. It's still possible.

2310
03:26:59,430 --> 03:27:04,229
That's not a real person.

2311
03:27:04,229 --> 03:27:06,729
Whatever. It's still possible.

2312
03:27:06,729 --> 03:27:08,729
I can still do that.

2313
03:27:08,729 --> 03:27:21,719
Shit. That was kinda close.

2314
03:27:24,340 --> 03:27:37,579
Shit!

2315
03:27:44,340 --> 03:27:46,340
I believe you can beat this level.

2316
03:27:46,340 --> 03:27:48,340
I'm gonna try, man!

2317
03:27:48,340 --> 03:27:52,440
Do it! Fuck you!

2318
03:27:52,440 --> 03:27:57,030
This is embarrassing.

2319
03:27:57,030 --> 03:27:59,030
No, it's hard. It's really hard.

2320
03:27:59,030 --> 03:28:04,540
Here. I made this

2321
03:28:04,540 --> 03:28:06,540
for you. Okay, here's- let me see.

2322
03:28:06,540 --> 03:28:08,540
Level 18.

2323
03:28:08,540 --> 03:28:10,540
Expert tutorial. Simple.

2324
03:28:10,540 --> 03:28:12,540
It's part with extra reverb.

2325
03:28:12,540 --> 03:28:14,540
Thanks for making me open a bunch of tabs that I don't want.

2326
03:28:17,670 --> 03:28:24,950
Come on, man.

2327
03:28:28,469 --> 03:28:37,159
Man. It's right there.

2328
03:28:37,159 --> 03:29:02,309
It's so funny, cause that's like the

2329
03:29:02,309 --> 03:29:04,309
Just Do It meme, but I guarantee you

2330
03:29:04,309 --> 03:29:06,309
there are people that are sitting there watching this right now

2331
03:29:06,309 --> 03:29:08,309
just actually screamed at me.

2332
03:29:08,309 --> 03:29:12,280
That angry, too.

2333
03:29:12,280 --> 03:29:14,280
Like that upset.

2334
03:29:14,280 --> 03:29:25,139
Help me. Help me.

2335
03:29:25,139 --> 03:29:27,319
Help me, please.

2336
03:29:27,319 --> 03:29:29,319
I need help. I can't

2337
03:29:29,319 --> 03:29:31,319
be defeated by this. I can't.

2338
03:29:31,319 --> 03:29:33,319
I can't be defeated by this. It's too sad. I need to beat this.

2339
03:29:37,909 --> 03:29:39,909
This guy sucks. No!

2340
03:29:39,909 --> 03:29:41,909
Stop! I don't- do I?

2341
03:29:41,909 --> 03:29:43,909
I got maybe a little.

2342
03:29:43,909 --> 03:29:45,909
Fuck.

2343
03:29:48,280 --> 03:29:50,280
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Read this.

2344
03:29:50,280 --> 03:29:53,420
Be in the middle when it's tilting against you.

2345
03:29:53,420 --> 03:29:55,420
Tilt to the higher side.

2346
03:29:55,420 --> 03:29:57,420
I tried that.

2347
03:29:57,420 --> 03:30:01,700
I tried that already.

2348
03:30:01,700 --> 03:30:07,340
Why does this look like a different game?

2349
03:30:07,340 --> 03:30:13,420
Swing bar?

2350
03:30:13,420 --> 03:30:15,850
Is this the right game?

2351
03:30:15,850 --> 03:30:17,850
Is this a different game?

2352
03:30:17,850 --> 03:30:29,799
Is this the right one?

2353
03:30:29,799 --> 03:30:37,479
My claw doesn't look like that.

2354
03:30:37,479 --> 03:30:41,639
This is a different fucking game, man.

2355
03:30:41,639 --> 03:30:43,639
Stay in the middle, idiot. I'm- all right, look!

2356
03:30:43,639 --> 03:30:48,569
You can't

2357
03:30:48,569 --> 03:30:50,569
stay in the middle, guys.

2358
03:30:50,569 --> 03:30:52,569
You have to be going really fast.

2359
03:30:52,569 --> 03:31:14,569
You can't stay in the middle.

2360
03:31:14,569 --> 03:31:25,510
God damn, I almost TAS'd it.

2361
03:31:25,510 --> 03:31:27,510
I ran as little as possible. I'm trying.

2362
03:31:27,510 --> 03:31:34,299
It's a waste to gain speed.

2363
03:31:34,299 --> 03:31:47,930
I just went to the clock.

2364
03:31:47,930 --> 03:31:50,229
Oh my god. It's been like

2365
03:31:50,229 --> 03:32:01,299
45 minutes.

2366
03:32:01,299 --> 03:32:03,299
In some of the videos, people are leading this to use

2367
03:32:03,299 --> 03:32:05,299
the big monkey. I think you need to change.

2368
03:32:05,299 --> 03:32:15,979
Suck up! What's the monkey ball?

2369
03:32:16,979 --> 03:32:21,059
Okay. Here we go.

2370
03:32:21,059 --> 03:32:23,489
This is an actual video.

2371
03:32:23,489 --> 03:32:25,489
It looks like a real video.

2372
03:32:25,489 --> 03:32:27,489
It was uploaded like five years ago.

2373
03:32:27,489 --> 03:32:29,489
This is not somebody fucking around.

2374
03:32:29,489 --> 03:32:42,340
Let's see.

2375
03:32:56,340 --> 03:32:58,340
That's what I'm doing!

2376
03:33:04,180 --> 03:33:06,180
Isn't that what I'm trying to do already?

2377
03:33:06,180 --> 03:33:08,180
This is a text tutorial.

2378
03:33:08,180 --> 03:33:10,180
Make your way as fast as you can

2379
03:33:10,180 --> 03:33:12,180
across the bridge and hold the uphill

2380
03:33:12,180 --> 03:33:20,379
direction whenever necessary.

2381
03:33:20,379 --> 03:33:23,829
Great advice.

2382
03:33:23,829 --> 03:33:25,829
Momentum glitch, level 18.

2383
03:33:25,829 --> 03:33:27,829
Monkey's in a circle, okay, whatever.

2384
03:33:27,829 --> 03:33:30,649
I'm doing everything that I'm- all right, I'm gonna turn the music off.

2385
03:33:30,649 --> 03:33:39,159
I'm just gonna try it like this.

2386
03:33:39,159 --> 03:33:46,200
The only thing you have to do here is tilt

2387
03:33:46,200 --> 03:33:49,340
to the side when it tilts to the side.

2388
03:33:49,340 --> 03:33:51,340
Okay.

2389
03:33:51,340 --> 03:33:58,760
Okay.

2390
03:33:58,760 --> 03:34:00,760
Hold right to the side when it tilts to the side.

2391
03:34:00,760 --> 03:34:03,129
Except that doesn't work.

2392
03:34:03,129 --> 03:34:06,969
I'm holding right right now.

2393
03:34:06,969 --> 03:34:08,969
And it doesn't do anything, man.

2394
03:34:08,969 --> 03:34:15,620
Before it tilts.

2395
03:34:15,620 --> 03:34:17,860
That's what I'm doing.

2396
03:34:17,860 --> 03:34:19,860
Holding left, tilting. All right.

2397
03:34:19,860 --> 03:34:23,059
I'm not doing anything.

2398
03:34:23,059 --> 03:34:25,059
Forward right, forward left, forward right, forward left.

2399
03:34:25,059 --> 03:34:27,500
I'm about to put on a hand cam.

2400
03:34:27,500 --> 03:34:38,760
So you can see what's happening.

2401
03:34:38,760 --> 03:34:40,760
I'm convinced he's doing this wrong.

2402
03:34:40,760 --> 03:34:42,760
You can't be convinced! No, I don't want to show you my controller.

2403
03:34:42,760 --> 03:34:50,040
It's got a bunch of dirt all over it.

2404
03:34:50,040 --> 03:34:52,040
It has inputs on the screen. Yeah, I know.

2405
03:34:52,040 --> 03:34:56,520
I can't believe Sony made that fucking video.

2406
03:34:56,520 --> 03:34:59,079
That's so funny.

2407
03:34:59,079 --> 03:35:07,209
Money monkey gif. 100 gecs?

2408
03:35:07,209 --> 03:35:21,540
That was it. That was it.

2409
03:35:21,540 --> 03:35:23,979
Everybody relax. Nobody move.

2410
03:35:23,979 --> 03:35:25,979
I don't want anybody to move. Don't fucking move.

2411
03:35:25,979 --> 03:35:48,170
Shit!

2412
03:35:48,170 --> 03:35:50,600
Fellas! Boys and girls, he did it!

2413
03:35:50,600 --> 03:36:07,479
Okay, so like I look-

2414
03:36:07,479 --> 03:36:09,479
Clementines are so much easier to eat than oranges.

2415
03:36:09,479 --> 03:36:11,659
You know what I mean? Like-

2416
03:36:11,659 --> 03:36:13,659
Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2417
03:36:13,659 --> 03:36:32,090
I have to do this? Please.

2418
03:36:32,090 --> 03:36:34,649
What are you doing, man?

2419
03:36:34,649 --> 03:36:41,049
What the fuck are you doing?

2420
03:36:41,049 --> 03:36:43,049
What's that record on that level? What's the record on that level?

2421
03:36:43,049 --> 03:36:45,049
I want it. What's the world record on that level without

2422
03:36:45,049 --> 03:36:49,399
current terms assisted bots?

2423
03:36:49,399 --> 03:37:15,000
I want to know what it is.

2424
03:37:15,000 --> 03:37:25,690
18 left. Actual world record.

2425
03:37:25,690 --> 03:37:29,590
No.

2426
03:37:29,590 --> 03:37:42,200
Was it? I don't know. Could have been.

2427
03:37:42,200 --> 03:37:45,530
Welcome to the next hour.

2428
03:37:45,530 --> 03:37:51,020
Wait a minute.

2429
03:37:51,020 --> 03:37:53,260
I missed the world record

2430
03:37:53,260 --> 03:37:55,260
by 0

2431
03:37:55,260 --> 03:37:57,260
by 0.02

2432
03:37:57,260 --> 03:38:03,399
seconds. Did I?

2433
03:38:03,399 --> 03:38:15,159
Shit. Alright, this one is

2434
03:38:15,159 --> 03:38:17,159
all over the place. So you're going to go run,

2435
03:38:17,159 --> 03:38:19,159
left, run, right. No you don't. Just run right

2436
03:38:19,159 --> 03:38:24,860
down the middle. Okay.

2437
03:38:24,860 --> 03:38:31,000
Weird. Is this an illusion?

2438
03:38:31,000 --> 03:38:33,000
It's kind of just an optical illusion.

2439
03:38:33,000 --> 03:39:08,969
Wrong monkey.

2440
03:39:08,969 --> 03:39:19,340
I get it. You have to-

2441
03:39:19,340 --> 03:39:21,340
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it. I know what you

2442
03:39:21,340 --> 03:39:24,920
have to do. You have to-

2443
03:39:24,920 --> 03:39:33,690
This is gonna suck ass.

2444
03:39:33,690 --> 03:39:35,690
It's gonna be hard, but you gotta just keep it right on the edge,

2445
03:39:35,690 --> 03:39:37,690
right on the edge, right on the edge.

2446
03:39:37,690 --> 03:39:58,979
Fuck you.

2447
03:39:58,979 --> 03:40:02,360
Edgy. Yes.

2448
03:40:02,360 --> 03:40:04,360
That is how you could describe it.

2449
03:40:04,360 --> 03:40:19,340
Why did you read that?

2450
03:40:21,510 --> 03:40:28,940
You know what that means.

2451
03:40:28,940 --> 03:40:36,090
Let's move on from that one. Pretending?

2452
03:40:36,090 --> 03:40:38,579
Yes.

2453
03:40:38,579 --> 03:40:40,579
Let's make it a clean yes.

2454
03:40:40,579 --> 03:40:56,059
Stupid.

2455
03:40:56,059 --> 03:40:58,059
Why am I? I'm addicted to this game now.

2456
03:40:58,059 --> 03:41:00,420
Once I overcame

2457
03:41:00,420 --> 03:41:02,420
tilt level, now I can't stop.

2458
03:41:02,420 --> 03:41:04,420
How many more levels are there?

2459
03:41:04,420 --> 03:41:06,420
Like, 30? Great.

2460
03:41:06,420 --> 03:41:09,110
I definitely will not get through this.

2461
03:41:09,110 --> 03:41:39,129
Even with cheating.

2462
03:41:39,129 --> 03:41:47,260
It's gonna be- Fucking idiot.

2463
03:41:47,260 --> 03:41:58,069
That's so annoying.

2464
03:41:58,069 --> 03:42:17,209
It makes it harder somehow.

2465
03:42:17,209 --> 03:42:21,940
That's gonna be way worse.

2466
03:42:21,940 --> 03:42:33,909
Remember, please wake up. We miss you.

2467
03:42:33,909 --> 03:42:37,879
It actually- You know what?

2468
03:42:37,879 --> 03:42:42,860
We just need it to be slower.

2469
03:42:42,860 --> 03:43:15,819
Fucking game, man.

2470
03:43:15,819 --> 03:43:18,120
This fucking game.

2471
03:43:31,559 --> 03:43:41,860
Ooh, this one's Sega.

2472
03:43:41,860 --> 03:43:56,069
World record.

2473
03:43:56,069 --> 03:43:58,069
I guess the time would be the same, right?

2474
03:43:58,069 --> 03:44:00,950
The time would be a record, but-

2475
03:44:00,950 --> 03:44:12,149
How do they miss that shit?

2476
03:44:12,149 --> 03:44:19,829
Talk slowly?

2477
03:44:19,829 --> 03:44:22,069
Make it seem- Hold on.

2478
03:44:22,069 --> 03:44:36,979
Super Monkey Ball!

2479
03:44:36,979 --> 03:44:38,979
Alright, so if I go this way.

2480
03:44:49,270 --> 03:44:54,459
I think I'll be okay.

2481
03:44:54,459 --> 03:44:57,340
I- I hit my head though, that sucks.

2482
03:44:57,340 --> 03:45:00,540
You can try it again, though.

2483
03:45:00,540 --> 03:45:06,299
The game's kind of fun.

2484
03:45:06,299 --> 03:45:08,299
I mean, two is probably-

2485
03:45:08,299 --> 03:45:11,049
People said two is gonna be better than one.

2486
03:45:11,049 --> 03:45:14,309
That makes sense, I guess.

2487
03:45:29,559 --> 03:45:31,559
I fell down again. Fuck.

2488
03:45:31,559 --> 03:45:36,360
I'm not very good, but

2489
03:45:36,360 --> 03:45:38,360
the games have their strengths and weaknesses, so.

2490
03:45:38,360 --> 03:45:41,180
One is more puzzle-oriented.

2491
03:45:41,180 --> 03:45:43,180
Two is more slide-oriented.

2492
03:45:43,180 --> 03:45:54,180
What's supposed to happen?

2493
03:45:54,180 --> 03:46:00,840
Well, I can tell you this is not supposed to happen.

2494
03:46:00,840 --> 03:46:04,100
It's not actually happening. Alright, stop fucking around.

2495
03:46:04,100 --> 03:46:07,500
This one's more Dave-oriented, yeah.

2496
03:46:07,500 --> 03:46:21,899
Why do they think I could do that?

2497
03:46:21,899 --> 03:46:28,040
One is more shitty-oriented.

2498
03:46:28,040 --> 03:46:30,040
Two is more puzzle-oriented.

2499
03:46:30,040 --> 03:46:34,780
There are a lot of Super Monkey Ball

2500
03:46:34,780 --> 03:46:36,780
original haters in here today.

2501
03:46:36,780 --> 03:46:40,809
I've noticed that.

2502
03:46:40,809 --> 03:46:42,809
There's quite a few of you guys. Is it really that-

2503
03:46:42,809 --> 03:46:46,260
Is it that accurate?

2504
03:46:46,260 --> 03:46:59,190
Should I go fast?

2505
03:46:59,190 --> 03:47:11,909
David.

2506
03:47:11,909 --> 03:47:18,379
Take all games at face value.

2507
03:47:18,379 --> 03:47:20,379
You get to go much faster than this. I don't know.

2508
03:47:20,379 --> 03:47:37,379
How do you get over there?

2509
03:47:37,379 --> 03:47:54,329
Shit, like that. Whoa!

2510
03:47:54,329 --> 03:48:08,149
I'm not soft-locked, I'm fine.

2511
03:48:08,149 --> 03:48:21,510
Shit. Wait, what just happened?

2512
03:48:21,510 --> 03:48:23,510
What happened? What did I just do?

2513
03:48:23,510 --> 03:48:26,840
Is it connected?

2514
03:48:26,840 --> 03:48:41,559
It wasn't connected.

2515
03:48:41,559 --> 03:48:43,559
How do I hop over from here to there?

2516
03:48:43,559 --> 03:48:58,780
Got it.

2517
03:48:58,780 --> 03:49:00,780
This one looks real

2518
03:49:00,780 --> 03:49:06,659
good.

2519
03:49:06,659 --> 03:49:08,659
This one, we can just brute force, I think.

2520
03:49:08,659 --> 03:49:12,250
I would say this one's brute forceable.

2521
03:49:12,250 --> 03:49:37,700
100 Gex.

2522
03:49:37,700 --> 03:49:40,459
Okay, much harder than I thought.

2523
03:49:52,920 --> 03:49:57,129
Unlimited.

2524
03:49:57,129 --> 03:50:31,750
Nobody wrote

2525
03:50:31,750 --> 03:50:33,750
Ultra Gamer Instinct.

2526
03:50:33,750 --> 03:50:39,510
It's like, how does he do it?

2527
03:50:39,510 --> 03:50:41,510
He's a maniac.

2528
03:50:41,510 --> 03:50:45,290
He can do anything. He's so good.

2529
03:50:45,290 --> 03:50:47,719
He's so good.

2530
03:50:47,719 --> 03:50:58,979
Okay, hold on. I have-

2531
03:50:58,979 --> 03:51:00,979
What's the world record for the next level?

2532
03:51:00,979 --> 03:51:07,750
I'm curious. What is it?

2533
03:51:07,750 --> 03:51:09,750
I'm gonna try to get the time world record.

2534
03:51:09,750 --> 03:51:19,850
Uh, what is the record here?

2535
03:51:19,850 --> 03:51:33,159
This one sucks.

2536
03:51:33,159 --> 03:51:40,200
I mean, it kinda looks like it.

2537
03:51:40,200 --> 03:51:42,819
Damn. No one's ever beaten this level.

2538
03:51:42,819 --> 03:51:49,219
Somebody jumps from the corner

2539
03:51:49,219 --> 03:51:57,290
of the map.

2540
03:51:57,290 --> 03:51:59,290
Wait, you have to jump? Like, there?

2541
03:51:59,290 --> 03:52:02,739
Alright, maybe not this one.

2542
03:52:02,739 --> 03:52:04,739
One that's way more complicated,

2543
03:52:04,739 --> 03:52:06,739
that's really hard.

2544
03:52:06,739 --> 03:52:11,159
That takes a ton of patience.

2545
03:52:11,159 --> 03:52:13,159
Okay, that turn is hard as shit.

2546
03:52:13,159 --> 03:52:22,809
It could be this one.

2547
03:52:22,809 --> 03:52:25,940
Really sharp right turn.

2548
03:52:25,940 --> 03:52:36,760
Don't be deceived.

2549
03:52:36,760 --> 03:52:38,760
This is not too bad, although I say that now.

2550
03:52:38,760 --> 03:52:41,959
Why does this one suck?

2551
03:52:41,959 --> 03:52:43,959
Everyone was saying, this one sucks, this one sucks, this one sucks.

2552
03:52:43,959 --> 03:52:45,959
Why? I mean, I'm just a fucking idiot.

2553
03:52:45,959 --> 03:53:04,649
That's why I fell off. That has nothing to do with how hard the level is.

2554
03:53:04,649 --> 03:53:06,649
It's just boring.

2555
03:53:06,649 --> 03:53:10,040
Yeah, I guess it kind of is.

2556
03:53:10,040 --> 03:53:18,489
Just go right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.

2557
03:53:18,489 --> 03:53:34,149
Uh, shit.

2558
03:53:34,149 --> 03:53:38,569
Time. Running out of time, running out of time.

2559
03:53:38,569 --> 03:53:46,440
Holy shit, you have to do this

2560
03:53:46,440 --> 03:53:48,440
so fast. You have to do this SO fast.

2561
03:53:48,440 --> 03:54:24,010
Even with the fucking cheating.

2562
03:54:24,010 --> 03:54:27,209
Admit it, he admits it.

2563
03:54:27,209 --> 03:54:29,209
Yeah, what do you think? My computer's broken?

2564
03:54:29,209 --> 03:54:36,889
I'm going way too fast.

2565
03:54:36,889 --> 03:54:46,040
Alright, I'm gonna do, I'm gonna just be

2566
03:54:46,040 --> 03:54:48,040
5% faster than I was last time.

2567
03:54:48,040 --> 03:54:51,370
I can do that when the speed is slower.

2568
03:54:51,370 --> 03:54:56,739
Take it slow, I'll be good.

2569
03:54:56,739 --> 03:55:00,200
I have way more reaction time.

2570
03:55:00,200 --> 03:55:09,610
And I fucking fell off. I knew it was gonna fucking happen.

2571
03:55:09,610 --> 03:55:11,610
I knew it was gonna fucking happen.

2572
03:55:11,610 --> 03:55:13,610
I knew it. I'm just gonna start save-stating. Fuck this level. This place sucks.

2573
03:55:13,610 --> 03:55:27,049
I just looked at chat. I just read chat for no reason.

2574
03:55:27,049 --> 03:55:29,049
Why did I do that?

2575
03:55:29,049 --> 03:55:55,079
Oh shit, leaked!

2576
03:55:55,079 --> 03:56:05,559
Get that off the screen!

2577
03:56:05,559 --> 03:56:16,760
Get that off the fucking screen, mate!

2578
03:56:16,760 --> 03:56:25,850
What are you fucking doing?

2579
03:56:25,850 --> 03:56:28,790
Bad world.

2580
03:56:28,790 --> 03:56:30,790
It's not even, why would I want to take that window?

2581
03:56:30,790 --> 03:56:34,059
It won't take this other window now.

2582
03:56:34,059 --> 03:56:47,500
Why?

2583
03:56:47,500 --> 03:56:53,639
Oh fuck, that game starts.

2584
03:56:53,639 --> 03:56:56,649
Okay, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2585
03:56:56,649 --> 03:56:58,649
Okay, look, we already went over this.

2586
03:56:58,649 --> 03:57:00,649
That was just, that was a screenshot for Dave.

2587
03:57:00,649 --> 03:57:03,020
He wanted me to take a screenshot.

2588
03:57:03,020 --> 03:57:05,020
You know, that was a screenshot

2589
03:57:05,020 --> 03:57:07,020
from Dave to me.

2590
03:57:07,020 --> 03:57:09,020
He's like, dude, hey, these are my list of things that I'm trying to get to work.

2591
03:57:09,020 --> 03:57:11,020
Can you help me?

2592
03:57:11,020 --> 03:57:13,020
I'm like, alright, man, like I will eventually. Maybe like a little later or something.

2593
03:57:13,020 --> 03:57:16,219
I don't know.

2594
03:57:16,219 --> 03:57:18,219
That was a screenshot from Dave to me.

2595
03:57:18,219 --> 03:57:20,520
Don't fucking leak it again.

2596
03:57:20,520 --> 03:57:37,780
My computer crashed. Leaked.

2597
03:57:37,780 --> 03:57:39,780
Where does this press play on mad world right now?

2598
03:57:39,780 --> 03:57:44,309
No.

2599
03:57:44,309 --> 03:57:46,309
There's a disc right behind me. I got

2600
03:57:46,309 --> 03:57:48,309
the controller, I got the system, and I, you know, I can

2601
03:57:48,309 --> 03:57:50,309
my, I, uh,

2602
03:57:50,309 --> 03:57:52,309
look, I own everything.

2603
03:57:52,309 --> 03:57:54,309
I own them all. I own everything.

2604
03:57:54,309 --> 03:57:56,309
They're in the house right now. They're right behind me.

2605
03:57:56,309 --> 03:58:16,469
I don't, what's with like the weird dust filter

2606
03:58:16,469 --> 03:58:18,469
that's on this? I don't like that.

2607
03:58:18,469 --> 03:58:25,059
I just have to get up there with an extra

2608
03:58:25,059 --> 03:58:29,540
five seconds left.

2609
03:58:29,540 --> 03:58:31,540
Man, I don't know much more. This shit I can take.

2610
03:58:31,540 --> 03:58:42,040
Bunker S. What?

2611
03:58:42,040 --> 03:58:45,670
What'd I say?

2612
03:58:45,670 --> 03:59:00,969
What'd I say? What'd I do?

2613
03:59:00,969 --> 03:59:08,840
Fucking hard turns, dude.

2614
03:59:08,840 --> 03:59:23,110
Oh, come on, man. Fuck this.

2615
03:59:23,110 --> 03:59:25,110
Oh, fuck this. Screw this. Fuck this game. Fuck this level.

2616
03:59:25,110 --> 03:59:27,110
Still here.

2617
03:59:27,110 --> 03:59:43,030
I'm still playing it. Whatever.

2618
03:59:43,030 --> 03:59:47,959
Oh.

2619
03:59:47,959 --> 03:59:49,959
What?

2620
03:59:49,959 --> 03:59:51,959
I just don't wanna. I don't wanna.

2621
03:59:51,959 --> 03:59:58,549
I have to put it on slow motion.

2622
03:59:58,549 --> 04:00:02,780
It's the only way I'm gonna do it.

2623
04:00:02,780 --> 04:00:04,780
It's the only way it's gonna happen. I'm sorry, everybody.

2624
04:00:04,780 --> 04:00:07,079
I'm sorry.

2625
04:00:07,079 --> 04:00:17,500
This has to happen.

2626
04:00:17,500 --> 04:00:30,489
I apologize.

2627
04:00:30,489 --> 04:00:32,489
The original game does not have slow motion.

2628
04:00:32,489 --> 04:00:40,469
Yeah, well, you didn't get

2629
04:00:40,469 --> 04:00:42,469
you a copy from a guy like that in the back

2630
04:00:42,469 --> 04:00:46,379
of his van. It was burned

2631
04:00:46,379 --> 04:00:53,739
onto a CD-R.

2632
04:00:53,739 --> 04:00:55,739
Oh, my fucking God.

2633
04:00:55,739 --> 04:01:07,379
You talk a lot of

2634
04:01:07,379 --> 04:01:21,079
bad game for a little guy.

2635
04:01:21,079 --> 04:01:23,079
How can I still screw this up?

2636
04:01:23,079 --> 04:01:26,729
Actual worst voice?

2637
04:01:26,729 --> 04:01:28,729
Isn't that what it was? Doesn't know what it does.

2638
04:01:28,729 --> 04:01:30,729
It's like, you talk a lot. Yeah.

2639
04:01:30,729 --> 04:01:33,670
Except people are giving me money.

2640
04:01:33,670 --> 04:01:48,200
Captain Squiggle, thanks for the ten

2641
04:01:48,200 --> 04:01:51,079
good meter days sub. Thanks, though.

2642
04:01:51,079 --> 04:01:57,219
Seriously. I do it every time

2643
04:01:57,219 --> 04:01:59,219
even in slow motion. I fucking swear to God.

2644
04:01:59,219 --> 04:02:01,850
I'm about to rip the game up. I'm about to pull the game out of the

2645
04:02:01,850 --> 04:02:07,350
theoretical GameCube.

2646
04:02:07,350 --> 04:02:09,350
Theoretically pulling the disc out of the GameCube

2647
04:02:09,350 --> 04:02:15,180
tray in my mind. What's a good

2648
04:02:15,180 --> 04:02:17,180
speed to do? Like 20 miles per hour? I think

2649
04:02:17,180 --> 04:02:19,180
20 is good. I can take corners

2650
04:02:19,180 --> 04:02:30,889
easier that way. If I stay at

2651
04:02:30,889 --> 04:02:47,319
20, we're good.

2652
04:02:47,319 --> 04:02:49,319
You're gonna stop underclocking

2653
04:02:49,319 --> 04:02:58,469
your GameCube. Dude.

2654
04:02:58,469 --> 04:03:01,930
Stay at 20.

2655
04:03:01,930 --> 04:03:13,319
Stop reading chat. Finish the level. I am.

2656
04:03:13,319 --> 04:03:28,860
You talk a lot of

2657
04:03:28,860 --> 04:03:31,719
bad game.

2658
04:03:31,719 --> 04:03:33,719
I'm so

2659
04:03:33,719 --> 04:03:37,690
so fucked up right now.

2660
04:03:37,690 --> 04:03:39,690
Dude, stop. I'm not doing anything. I'm just

2661
04:03:39,690 --> 04:03:42,120
fucking saying a word.

2662
04:03:42,120 --> 04:03:44,120
Can I say, oh, you talk a lot of

2663
04:03:44,120 --> 04:03:46,549
big game. Just as me?

2664
04:03:46,549 --> 04:03:48,549
Or is that off limits forever

2665
04:03:48,549 --> 04:04:08,200
now? Is this, am I even

2666
04:04:08,200 --> 04:04:10,200
still gonna actually be able to finish this?

2667
04:04:10,200 --> 04:04:13,340
Even with the super slow motion

2668
04:04:13,340 --> 04:04:24,979
going like 20? It's gonna be close.

2669
04:04:24,979 --> 04:04:31,579
I might get it. That turn.

2670
04:04:31,579 --> 04:04:33,819
Alright, then we're gonna full

2671
04:04:33,819 --> 04:04:35,819
blast here and then full blast here. No, I definitely

2672
04:04:35,819 --> 04:04:58,010
have it. Full blast.

2673
04:04:58,010 --> 04:05:00,629
Five, four, don't go

2674
04:05:00,629 --> 04:05:04,219
that fast. Still have to go through the

2675
04:05:04,219 --> 04:05:15,420
gate.

2676
04:05:15,420 --> 04:05:18,489
Doesn't it feel weird? Feels like the game's

2677
04:05:18,489 --> 04:05:25,590
wrong. This one's cool.

2678
04:05:25,590 --> 04:05:31,270
This one's cool. I like this one. I gotta do Tony Hawk

2679
04:05:31,270 --> 04:05:49,559
Momentum. Cool.

2680
04:05:49,559 --> 04:05:52,120
That one was just fun.

2681
04:05:52,120 --> 04:05:54,120
That one doesn't belong in expert. That one was just

2682
04:05:54,120 --> 04:06:00,069
fun. This is a Mario Sunshine

2683
04:06:00,069 --> 04:06:02,069
bonus level. I already hate it.

2684
04:06:02,069 --> 04:06:27,270
Okay. Holy shit.

2685
04:06:27,270 --> 04:06:29,270
The end is right there. Did I miss it?

2686
04:06:29,270 --> 04:06:43,420
That actually would have been pretty awesome.

2687
04:06:43,420 --> 04:07:06,309
Holy shit. I can get it.

2688
04:07:06,309 --> 04:07:08,309
Easy, easy. Slow, slow, slow, slow. Don't go

2689
04:07:08,309 --> 04:07:12,520
fast. Unnecessary.

2690
04:07:12,520 --> 04:07:14,520
I bounced so high.

2691
04:07:14,520 --> 04:07:29,430
Stupid asshole.

2692
04:07:29,430 --> 04:07:34,680
We can't cheat on every single level.

2693
04:07:34,680 --> 04:07:41,079
Not you. I'm not talking about you guys.

2694
04:07:41,079 --> 04:07:56,120
These are not as hard as the other ones

2695
04:07:56,120 --> 04:08:02,069
were. They really aren't.

2696
04:08:02,069 --> 04:08:04,069
Okay, we're going safe. I don't care about the bananas.

2697
04:08:04,069 --> 04:08:12,709
This is gonna be horrible.

2698
04:08:12,709 --> 04:08:16,229
Horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible.

2699
04:08:16,229 --> 04:08:24,620
Is this other side

2700
04:08:24,620 --> 04:08:29,100
better somehow?

2701
04:08:29,100 --> 04:08:46,870
Kind of. Slow down.

2702
04:08:46,870 --> 04:08:48,870
He's still playing this. Yeah.

2703
04:08:48,870 --> 04:09:12,940
Damn it. I couldn't put my hand

2704
04:09:12,940 --> 04:09:37,899
on F1 fast enough.

2705
04:09:37,899 --> 04:09:39,899
Jesus, man. What the fuck.

2706
04:09:39,899 --> 04:09:49,370
I almost just did it. I almost just pressed it. Thank

2707
04:09:49,370 --> 04:09:51,370
God I didn't. I pressed 1 instead of F1.

2708
04:09:51,370 --> 04:10:09,479
This is dumb.

2709
04:10:09,479 --> 04:10:34,680
No. Thank God.

2710
04:10:34,680 --> 04:10:47,610
You know, when this stream first started

2711
04:10:47,610 --> 04:10:49,610
I really, really thought you guys were just like

2712
04:10:49,610 --> 04:10:52,420
messing around. There was no way

2713
04:10:52,420 --> 04:10:55,430
he was going to beat this.

2714
04:10:55,430 --> 04:10:57,430
Like, not a single

2715
04:10:57,430 --> 04:10:59,860
solitary chance in hell.

2716
04:10:59,860 --> 04:11:01,860
I'm like, what? It's Monkey Ball.

2717
04:11:01,860 --> 04:11:03,860
This game's on iPad.

2718
04:11:03,860 --> 04:11:13,379
I had no fucking idea.

2719
04:11:13,379 --> 04:11:19,909
You're literally cheating.

2720
04:11:19,909 --> 04:11:21,909
I'm not saying this is a victory.

2721
04:11:21,909 --> 04:11:49,989
Wait, what?

2722
04:11:49,989 --> 04:11:51,989
What? Come on. I hit

2723
04:11:51,989 --> 04:12:08,569
the goal post?

2724
04:12:08,569 --> 04:12:11,129
What's wrong with my mic? I probably

2725
04:12:11,129 --> 04:12:33,209
fucked it up or something. Yeah.

2726
04:12:33,209 --> 04:12:35,209
What's the, hey, what's the world record on that one?

2727
04:12:35,209 --> 04:12:59,899
What's the world record on that one? Dude.

2728
04:12:59,899 --> 04:13:03,290
What the hell do I do here?

2729
04:13:03,290 --> 04:13:08,979
I gotta watch. Okay, this is gonna be

2730
04:13:08,979 --> 04:13:24,520
horrible. Okay.

2731
04:13:24,520 --> 04:13:26,819
Nope. No way. No way. You gotta stay on there.

2732
04:13:26,819 --> 04:13:40,059
Wait, it turns on?

2733
04:13:40,059 --> 04:13:42,059
Sometimes, wait. What is

2734
04:13:42,059 --> 04:14:01,620
going on here? Dude. I

2735
04:14:01,620 --> 04:14:03,620
don't, dude, I don't think this is

2736
04:14:03,620 --> 04:14:18,260
Oh no!

2737
04:14:18,260 --> 04:14:32,280
Alright, we're good. What? Did I hit

2738
04:14:32,280 --> 04:14:34,280
F1? What did I press?

2739
04:14:34,280 --> 04:14:36,280
I don't know what I pressed.

2740
04:14:36,280 --> 04:14:38,280
I pressed caps lock.

2741
04:14:38,280 --> 04:15:04,440
Wait. It's okay. It's alright.

2742
04:15:04,440 --> 04:15:06,809
It's okay. It's crashed, but we're good.

2743
04:15:06,809 --> 04:15:10,059
Okay. We're good. We're in a good spot.

2744
04:15:10,059 --> 04:15:14,090
I can't imagine playing this

2745
04:15:14,090 --> 04:15:17,739
legit. I'm enjoying this game solely

2746
04:15:17,739 --> 04:15:29,059
because I'm able to do this. The game crashed?

2747
04:15:29,059 --> 04:15:31,690
Yeah, I remember the GameCube games back in the

2748
04:15:31,690 --> 04:15:33,690
day. Yeah, they just crashed all the fucking time.

2749
04:15:33,690 --> 04:15:36,120
I fucked up, whatever.

2750
04:15:36,120 --> 04:15:38,549
That's why I lost the console war.

2751
04:15:38,549 --> 04:15:55,879
Good. Alright, we're on floor

2752
04:15:55,879 --> 04:16:02,149
30. Simple bonus floor.

2753
04:16:02,149 --> 04:16:11,750
Only, yeah, only 20 more

2754
04:16:11,750 --> 04:16:14,569
to go. I'll be surprised if I even get through

2755
04:16:14,569 --> 04:16:17,059
the next 10, let alone the next 5.

2756
04:16:17,059 --> 04:16:27,500
Floor 31.

2757
04:16:27,500 --> 04:16:35,110
Is there ice in this game?

2758
04:16:35,110 --> 04:16:45,030
Am I waiting for something in particular

2759
04:16:45,030 --> 04:16:55,719
or...not that bad.

2760
04:16:55,719 --> 04:17:17,909
This looks pretty bad.

2761
04:17:17,909 --> 04:17:21,370
I need to go that fast.

2762
04:17:21,370 --> 04:17:23,370
This is bad.

2763
04:17:23,370 --> 04:17:39,620
Is this ice?

2764
04:17:39,620 --> 04:17:54,469
Okay, I'll be honest with you.

2765
04:17:54,469 --> 04:17:58,569
I was just looking down at my chest.

2766
04:17:58,569 --> 04:18:46,309
I don't know why. I just looked at it.

2767
04:18:46,309 --> 04:18:48,309
Why?

2768
04:18:48,309 --> 04:18:52,340
Good jump spot?

2769
04:18:52,340 --> 04:19:10,700
Just jump. No, fuck it.

2770
04:19:10,700 --> 04:19:27,590
I can't jump. It might be time to turn

2771
04:19:27,590 --> 04:19:31,110
around to Gamer Instinct. It's almost Gamer Instinct

2772
04:19:31,110 --> 04:19:37,260
time. Yeah, it's gonna be Gamer Instinct time

2773
04:19:37,260 --> 04:20:30,180
here.

2774
04:20:30,180 --> 04:20:37,030
Alright, nice.

2775
04:20:37,030 --> 04:20:44,840
Look at how awesome that looked in real time.

2776
04:20:44,840 --> 04:20:48,680
Don't bump into anything. This looks okay.

2777
04:20:48,680 --> 04:20:55,719
Maybe not. Is that how he sees the world?

2778
04:20:55,719 --> 04:21:06,219
How the hell am I gonna do this?

2779
04:21:06,219 --> 04:21:08,219
You have to get tons of speed around here.

2780
04:21:08,219 --> 04:21:10,219
That's it.

2781
04:21:10,219 --> 04:21:15,659
Alright, I get it.

2782
04:21:15,659 --> 04:21:17,659
You just gotta fit inside like you're skiing.

2783
04:21:17,659 --> 04:21:23,479
I mean, that's easier said than done,

2784
04:21:23,479 --> 04:21:34,940
of course, right?

2785
04:21:34,940 --> 04:21:37,690
It's pretty easy, is it?

2786
04:21:37,690 --> 04:22:17,420
What am I doing wrong? Jump at the start.

2787
04:22:17,420 --> 04:22:24,780
Please jump. He didn't.

2788
04:22:24,780 --> 04:22:32,899
I think I can do it. Oh, fucking who cares?

2789
04:22:32,899 --> 04:22:45,639
Just try to do it normally. Get up there!

2790
04:22:45,639 --> 04:22:48,069
Come on! No!

2791
04:22:48,069 --> 04:22:53,000
Please! If you do this,

2792
04:22:53,000 --> 04:22:55,000
I'm gonna gift you 5 billion subs.

2793
04:22:55,000 --> 04:22:58,579
Uh, I don't- That would be

2794
04:22:58,579 --> 04:23:00,579
like- That would be like the entire

2795
04:23:00,579 --> 04:23:02,579
GDP of, like, New

2796
04:23:02,579 --> 04:23:04,579
Hampshire. So, I don't think you have that.

2797
04:23:04,579 --> 04:23:24,360
25 billion dollars

2798
04:23:24,360 --> 04:23:26,360
is the GDP of New Hampshire? I don't- Is it?

2799
04:23:26,360 --> 04:23:30,139
I don't know. It might be. Look it up.

2800
04:23:30,139 --> 04:23:38,780
I feel like it's, like, a small enough state.

2801
04:23:38,780 --> 04:23:43,559
Get up there! This sucks.

2802
04:23:43,559 --> 04:23:45,559
New Hampshire has a 69 billion

2803
04:23:45,559 --> 04:23:47,559
dollar GDP.

2804
04:23:47,559 --> 04:23:52,940
That was close. If you beat this level,

2805
04:23:52,940 --> 04:23:54,940
I will gift you 25 subs. Hold me accountable.

2806
04:23:54,940 --> 04:24:21,940
Okay. Corner. I know, I'm trying to get

2807
04:24:21,940 --> 04:24:29,049
to the corner. Remember, if you beat this level,

2808
04:24:29,049 --> 04:24:32,500
I'll gift you all my Tesla stock.

2809
04:24:32,500 --> 04:24:50,620
I don't- I really want it.

2810
04:24:50,620 --> 04:24:52,620
Oh, dude! That dude's about to give me the entire

2811
04:24:52,620 --> 04:24:54,620
GDP of Canada. I'll take it!

2812
04:24:54,620 --> 04:25:09,899
600 billion?

2813
04:25:09,899 --> 04:25:11,899
Remember, if you beat this first trial, I'll give you fucking 500 bucks.

2814
04:25:11,899 --> 04:25:13,899
Oh, really? Okay, dude! Thanks a lot, man!

2815
04:25:13,899 --> 04:25:36,420
Appreciate the 500 subs!

2816
04:25:36,420 --> 04:25:38,420
This one's gonna be horrible. 5 community subs

2817
04:25:38,420 --> 04:25:40,420
from Ecoleech. That's

2818
04:25:40,420 --> 04:25:43,620
not 500. You don't- Nobody actually

2819
04:25:43,620 --> 04:25:45,620
has to do that. I'm fucking around. Don't feel like

2820
04:25:45,620 --> 04:25:52,469
somebody has to do that. I guess you just have to

2821
04:25:52,469 --> 04:25:59,450
just wait. I'll take the 20.

2822
04:25:59,450 --> 04:26:01,450
Thanks, Goiki, for the 20 community subs.

2823
04:26:01,450 --> 04:26:04,010
I will definitely take them.

2824
04:26:04,010 --> 04:26:13,979
Appreciate it. Thanks a lot.

2825
04:26:13,979 --> 04:26:17,049
We kind of blew through the 30s here.

2826
04:26:17,049 --> 04:26:38,940
I thought I was gonna take way longer than this.

2827
04:26:38,940 --> 04:26:43,479
Eat shit, dude. This one was hard. Eat shit.

2828
04:26:43,479 --> 04:26:46,809
That one was hard. Not you guys

2829
04:26:46,809 --> 04:26:48,809
eat shit. Like, this guy in the

2830
04:26:48,809 --> 04:27:00,139
pamphlet ball. I don't know what just happened,

2831
04:27:00,139 --> 04:27:04,739
but whatever. Okay. All this with

2832
04:27:04,739 --> 04:27:06,739
one life remaining, by the way. I have to be very

2833
04:27:06,739 --> 04:27:08,739
careful that I do not

2834
04:27:08,739 --> 04:27:10,739
accidentally fuck up this save state.

2835
04:27:10,739 --> 04:27:18,469
In fact, shift F2.

2836
04:27:18,469 --> 04:27:22,309
Right? There.

2837
04:27:22,309 --> 04:27:25,700
Okay. Do we get a bounce?

2838
04:27:25,700 --> 04:27:31,209
We just bounce over in the

2839
04:27:31,209 --> 04:27:35,219
game. The game crashed.

2840
04:27:35,219 --> 04:27:38,549
If you could guess. The thing I have

2841
04:27:38,549 --> 04:27:45,659
both those save states, the game just crashed. Cool.

2842
04:27:45,659 --> 04:27:47,659
Remember when I elbow dropped off the top rope

2843
04:27:47,659 --> 04:27:49,659
in one of the Derma Rumbles a couple years ago in the

2844
04:27:49,659 --> 04:27:51,659
PS4, blue screened?

2845
04:27:51,659 --> 04:27:54,340
I was so disappointed. That was one of the worst things

2846
04:27:54,340 --> 04:27:59,139
ever. We had to do the whole Rumble

2847
04:27:59,139 --> 04:28:01,139
again, and it's like, oh, but the

2848
04:28:01,139 --> 04:28:03,700
outcome's gonna be different.

2849
04:28:03,700 --> 04:28:20,280
So bad. Holy shit.

2850
04:28:20,280 --> 04:28:22,280
I just did it. Did I do it?

2851
04:28:22,280 --> 04:28:24,280
I did it fast, but I did too fast.

2852
04:28:24,280 --> 04:28:28,950
That was fast.

2853
04:28:28,950 --> 04:28:55,350
Nope. Take it slow.

2854
04:28:55,350 --> 04:28:57,350
You don't have to be fast, you just have to be right.

2855
04:28:57,350 --> 04:29:10,840
Like that. I feel like I really

2856
04:29:10,840 --> 04:29:12,840
kind of went into a groove here in the 30s.

2857
04:29:12,840 --> 04:29:27,049
I want the camera to be facing this

2858
04:29:27,049 --> 04:29:35,180
way, please. Holy shit, they get smaller.

2859
04:29:35,180 --> 04:29:50,969
Damn.

2860
04:29:50,969 --> 04:29:52,969
Just close your eyes. I'll take

2861
04:29:52,969 --> 04:30:04,489
care of this. All right. Open your eyes. I did it.

2862
04:30:04,489 --> 04:30:15,670
This looks cool.

2863
04:30:15,670 --> 04:30:21,370
Oh, they go. How was I supposed

2864
04:30:21,370 --> 04:30:24,500
to do that? Wait.

2865
04:30:24,500 --> 04:30:28,899
Are they gonna slide behind me?

2866
04:30:28,899 --> 04:30:33,129
Oh. Did they stop?

2867
04:30:33,129 --> 04:30:36,520
No. That was a fun slide

2868
04:30:36,520 --> 04:30:40,420
level. Okay.

2869
04:30:40,420 --> 04:30:42,659
We've made it to the last 10.

2870
04:30:42,659 --> 04:30:46,250
It's 41.

2871
04:30:46,250 --> 04:31:05,500
Almost at it first try. One more.

2872
04:31:05,500 --> 04:31:17,139
That's it? All right. Good. Good.

2873
04:31:17,139 --> 04:31:21,620
Gotta beat the next level without looking. That's not gonna happen.

2874
04:31:21,620 --> 04:31:29,479
Guys.

2875
04:31:29,479 --> 04:31:47,909
One in the middle. Skips.

2876
04:31:47,909 --> 04:31:54,500
Just be slow. What's the rush? There is none.

2877
04:31:54,500 --> 04:32:08,819
We don't even need to skip. Fine.

2878
04:32:08,819 --> 04:32:31,340
Oh, okay. Wait?

2879
04:32:31,340 --> 04:32:37,530
Hurry up, dude. Oh, shit.

2880
04:32:37,530 --> 04:32:41,180
You gotta go fast.

2881
04:32:41,180 --> 04:32:50,120
Really fast.

2882
04:32:50,120 --> 04:33:03,159
Wait, I have an idea. That's gonna work.

2883
04:33:03,159 --> 04:33:12,950
Watch. Never mind.

2884
04:33:12,950 --> 04:33:30,549
Okay. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

2885
04:33:30,549 --> 04:33:49,479
Fuck you. Ape Escape is a

2886
04:33:49,479 --> 04:33:52,229
superior primate game. It might be.

2887
04:33:52,229 --> 04:33:54,229
Sure. I'll play it eventually.

2888
04:33:54,229 --> 04:34:20,380
Where is it? Shit.

2889
04:34:20,380 --> 04:34:28,950
What the hell was I doing? You gotta catch it

2890
04:34:28,950 --> 04:34:30,950
right when it comes across.

2891
04:34:30,950 --> 04:34:32,950
One. Two. Three.

2892
04:34:32,950 --> 04:34:34,950
Four. Five.

2893
04:34:34,950 --> 04:34:37,130
One. Two.

2894
04:34:37,130 --> 04:34:39,299
Three. Four. I'm counting

2895
04:34:39,299 --> 04:34:41,299
and looking down. Do I need to look down at my fingers

2896
04:34:41,299 --> 04:34:43,540
to count? What the hell am I

2897
04:34:43,540 --> 04:34:54,869
doing? Game crash.

2898
04:34:54,869 --> 04:34:59,099
And then you go from here to the other one.

2899
04:34:59,099 --> 04:35:07,220
What's going on?

2900
04:35:07,220 --> 04:35:19,110
Am I dumb? Am I dumb?

2901
04:35:19,110 --> 04:35:27,860
Hold on. Wait. I have to

2902
04:35:27,860 --> 04:35:32,340
go on. Go on this one

2903
04:35:32,340 --> 04:35:34,340
and you run just forward. Okay. I get it. I get it.

2904
04:35:34,340 --> 04:35:47,380
I know what to do.

2905
04:35:49,380 --> 04:35:52,069
Oh, this game.

2906
04:35:52,069 --> 04:35:54,069
This fucking game.

2907
04:35:54,069 --> 04:35:56,069
This fucking game.

2908
04:35:56,069 --> 04:36:10,279
Dude, what the fuck?

2909
04:36:10,279 --> 04:36:15,750
Where is it?

2910
04:36:15,750 --> 04:36:21,959
It's like right underneath me.

2911
04:36:21,959 --> 04:36:28,939
I had it too. Fuck you.

2912
04:36:28,939 --> 04:36:38,470
Little bounce.

2913
04:36:38,470 --> 04:36:40,779
Fucking physics. It's stupid.

2914
04:36:40,779 --> 04:36:42,779
This is 2001. Physics didn't even exist yet.

2915
04:36:42,779 --> 04:36:45,139
Why does it keep

2916
04:36:45,139 --> 04:36:58,900
turning me around?

2917
04:36:58,900 --> 04:37:00,900
Gravity didn't exist until 2006. Yeah.

2918
04:37:00,900 --> 04:37:15,540
I know. You get it.

2919
04:37:15,540 --> 04:37:27,900
Does this one work? This one's very easy.

2920
04:37:27,900 --> 04:37:32,180
Is it? Am I overthinking this one?

2921
04:37:32,180 --> 04:37:42,419
Whoa. This one's hard.

2922
04:37:42,419 --> 04:38:02,380
I had it right the first time.

2923
04:38:02,380 --> 04:38:04,380
Blank, blank, blank.

2924
04:38:04,380 --> 04:38:06,380
Blank, blank, blank, blank.

2925
04:38:06,380 --> 04:38:15,340
Blank, blank, blank, blank.

2926
04:38:15,340 --> 04:38:17,340
45, five more. We're getting to the end.

2927
04:38:17,340 --> 04:38:19,770
I'm going to beat this game and

2928
04:38:19,770 --> 04:38:50,619
everyone thought I wasn't going to do it.

2929
04:38:50,619 --> 04:38:56,700
What the fuck am I thinking?

2930
04:38:56,700 --> 04:38:58,700
Save states and slow down. Fake gamer.

2931
04:38:58,700 --> 04:39:01,509
Double fake. Whatever.

2932
04:39:01,509 --> 04:39:12,520
I didn't say I wasn't going to play without a handicap on.

2933
04:39:12,520 --> 04:39:15,849
What was the triple fake?

2934
04:39:15,849 --> 04:39:24,099
It was a triple fake? What was it?

2935
04:39:24,099 --> 04:39:26,099
No, I flew it. I fucking flew it.

2936
04:39:26,099 --> 04:40:10,380
Why?

2997
04:58:31,549 --> 04:58:40,930
with the fucking goddamn gamer sense this is why you never tell me to do

2998
04:58:40,930 --> 04:58:44,889
safe states because we end up it's just where it is like this whatever the word

2999
04:58:44,889 --> 04:58:50,919
is we end up in a situation where I it's impossible unless I do save states over

3000
04:58:50,919 --> 04:58:53,799
and over again then I get addicted to it because I have never ending continues

3034
05:09:43,979 --> 05:09:48,959
might matter if I do this all the way over here have it go all the way to the

3038
05:10:30,990 --> 05:11:04,069
feel satisfied now we can stop I'm done with this one we got golf number of

3039
05:11:04,069 --> 05:11:20,060
holes whatever 18 holes why would they make 18 holes it's part 3 it's just

3040
05:11:20,060 --> 05:11:40,529
mini golf oh this is awesome why can't I just have played this the whole time

3041
05:11:40,529 --> 05:12:10,880
let me try to get a hole in one and I'll be happy this is cute though this is

3042
05:12:10,880 --> 05:12:22,000
fine this is cute it's cute it's cool okay let's just gonna I'm gonna hit her

3043
05:12:22,040 --> 05:12:34,299
as hard as I possibly can just smash it how many times you do that at mini golf

3044
05:12:34,299 --> 05:12:41,319
by the way I remember going mini golf and then you do it a little too hard and

3045
05:12:41,319 --> 05:12:45,520
it would just bang bang bang bang bang would skip over into maybe another

3046
05:12:45,520 --> 05:12:50,360
family playing and you're like the turquoise ball would just roll down and

3047
05:12:50,360 --> 05:13:04,060
knock into two or three of their balls and ruin their day I was so bad at many

3048
05:13:04,060 --> 05:13:09,950
go if I hated it I always had too hard even if when I I hated it it drove me

3049
05:13:09,950 --> 05:13:24,310
nuts all the one I get a thousand points who hates mini golf it just

3050
05:13:24,310 --> 05:13:40,080
enrages me I don't know why to me it's the worst part about golf dialed up to a

3051
05:13:40,080 --> 05:13:45,389
thousand like hey you know this really difficult really impossible thing that

3052
05:13:45,389 --> 05:13:52,270
takes too much skill to do we're gonna put a windmill in front of you now you

3053
05:13:52,270 --> 05:13:57,909
give me you give me a two wood and driving range I can I could crush those

3054
05:13:57,909 --> 05:14:18,069
balls like happy Gilmore stuff I used to just drill balls at a driving range it

3055
05:14:18,110 --> 05:14:20,590
was such a flex too because you would go there with people that have no idea

3056
05:14:20,590 --> 05:14:24,430
what the hell's going on and they're like doing a weird form and the ball

3057
05:14:24,430 --> 05:14:28,189
rolls down like 20 feet in front of them it's embarrassing I get up there and I'm

3058
05:14:28,189 --> 05:14:34,880
just like these are all going like at least two to three hundred yards I'm

3059
05:14:34,880 --> 05:14:53,279
destroying them but anytime anyone wanted to do like a mini golf was always

3060
05:14:53,279 --> 05:15:04,400
I had something to do sorry I'm baking a cake with my mother I can't or it even

3061
05:15:04,400 --> 05:15:07,799
got to a point I think where I would go but I didn't want to play I wanted to be

3062
05:15:07,799 --> 05:15:17,150
the scorekeeper is after a while becomes a pain in the ass too when you get to

3063
05:15:17,150 --> 05:15:24,709
like hole seven or eight in mini golf aren't you kind of fucking over it like

3064
05:15:24,709 --> 05:15:32,799
an hour or two will go by and it's kind of over this and then you just start

3065
05:15:32,799 --> 05:15:39,720
dragging the ball with your club like oh yeah my turn okay there's like six of

3066
05:15:39,720 --> 05:15:45,360
us here my turn all right well just drag a little bit and let go I don't care

3067
05:15:45,360 --> 05:16:06,959
where it goes you like regular golf I only like the driving part that's it

3068
05:16:13,560 --> 05:16:29,080
I love just smashing balls like a bucket of balls and just watching them soar all

3069
05:16:29,080 --> 05:16:45,540
right that's it I uh that was fun that's where I'm gonna call it so let's go over

3100
05:23:10,819 --> 05:23:20,930
what happens keep it so he made a video with a fake tutorial that's the best

3101
05:23:20,930 --> 05:23:35,669
okay can I nominate that for best one guy moment I thought it was person you

3102
05:23:35,669 --> 05:23:59,099
somebody's the person a for the speed boost our clouds not safe okay I'm ready

3103
05:23:59,099 --> 05:24:35,729
why do they close it suffocating just like Mario right from aiming for the

3104
05:24:35,729 --> 05:25:31,459
target you have to close it okay I get it right here okay that's 10 maybe 10

3105
05:25:31,459 --> 05:25:41,959
rounds all right if I get it more than 10 right now I the game so I went

3106
05:25:48,139 --> 05:26:25,939
head into the pyramid didn't touch them game not over enough the baby just say

3107
05:26:25,939 --> 05:26:56,639
let's ago we have to go pretty low to get under these your career can't get

3108
05:26:56,639 --> 05:27:01,040
any lower yeah my monkey ball career I'm doing everything I'm doing fine what

3109
05:27:01,040 --> 05:27:07,060
you talking about I'm okay like what do you mean my career we put away what's

3110
05:27:07,060 --> 05:27:16,040
not my career we're talking about yeah that okay so very clearly I need to be

3111
05:27:16,040 --> 05:27:23,080
very odd when you close the thing it drops like a stone there is no forward

3112
05:27:23,080 --> 05:27:32,700
momentum the thing just drops like a fucking anchor okay what's wrong with

3113
05:27:32,700 --> 05:28:00,669
clouds you don't want momentum okay here we go it just closed a bunch of water in

3114
05:28:00,669 --> 05:28:39,290
there with them okay give me some points for God's sake actually I make my

3115
05:28:39,290 --> 05:28:59,119
descent I think it's time to make this sent well it's so fast look at the wind

3122
05:30:25,860 --> 05:30:28,419

3123
05:30:28,419 --> 05:30:36,650
playing with friends from like 2012 2013 that's probably the last time I did it

3128
05:31:35,689 --> 05:31:39,220

05:32:18,700 --> 05:32:24,500
I gotta redo all my stream stuff I need a new computer at least a new graphics

3134
05:32:24,500 --> 05:32:29,709
card the 38 is any good anyone that has one of the eight that exist are they

3135
05:32:29,709 --> 05:32:39,490
good are they yeah we'll do a raid we'll do we actually are going to we'll raid

3136
05:32:39,490 --> 05:32:52,330
we'll raid kitboga bogas live right now I'll be like I said joining him as a

3137
05:32:52,330 --> 05:32:56,840
guest spot on Friday so go take a look and see a kind of what you can expect

3138
05:32:56,840 --> 05:33:10,540
it more for designers and creators less for gaming yeah but I feel like I could

3139
05:33:10,540 --> 05:33:17,220
probably with with a better graphics card a better CPU I could probably have

3140
05:33:17,220 --> 05:33:27,700
the stream be somewhere like around 900 p and then drop my CPU limit kind of

3141
05:33:27,700 --> 05:33:33,029
processor down so the stream will just look better that CPU preset I could put

3142
05:33:33,029 --> 05:33:44,569
it at slow probably if I got like a 3080 and a one of the new thread rippers or

3143
05:33:44,569 --> 05:33:49,500
something I don't know I have to look into it but that was super monkey ball

3144
05:33:49,500 --> 05:33:56,409
and that's the stream I am in very surprised actually beat I thought I was

3145
