1
00:00:06,969 --> 00:00:11,689
All right, I had to make a lemonade. I was really into a lemonade.

2
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:21,350
Let's come back here. Hello. How are you? Let me go this way.

3
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,379
Should be able to. Maybe not quite yet.

4
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,729
Hmm. Uh-oh. I can't get this to show up.

5
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,799
Hmm. Uh-oh.

6
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:57,299
Hold on. There we go. All right, cool. It's called the invisible hand.

7
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,880
It's a game where you sell buy and trade stocks. Fake stocks.

8
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:07,659
Nothing that you hear from now going forward is financial advice.

9
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:15,030
Nothing you hear me say until the stream ends is me telling you what to buy, what to sell.

10
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:19,030
Not at all. This is not financial advice.

11
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:28,599
None of ev- This is all made up bullshit. Okay, here we go. Remember we're 12.

12
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,680
Shortage of- Okay, I told you this would happen.

13
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,219
Shortage of wa- Wait, I'm already going? Don't even think about trying to bail. It's too late.

14
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:40,819
Shortage of water. Emergency taxation to save the unit dollar. What?

15
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:43,450
We're gonna ride this one out. Don't worry about it.

16
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,939
Should I buy? Why aren't you saying anything? Why are people screaming in the background?

17
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:54,150
Shortage of manpower. Wait, what? Oil gas down. Logging is up.

18
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,469
Don't pay attention to them. Pay attention to me. This is what you paid me for.

19
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:58,310
Have you dumped that mining position? Don't do it.

20
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:04,980
Liquidate everything. Wait, don't do it. Everybody shut the fuck up. I'm on the phone.

21
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,379
Don't panic. Just a lot of things happening at once.

22
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:09,379
Wait, it's turning around. I think it's turning around.

23
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,189
Hello? Is your terminal busted? Ours is spewing a ton of crazy shit,

24
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:18,659
but I have no idea if any of it's real. Buy? What am I buying?

25
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:23,139
Green groceries. Okay, I'm gonna buy short for- I don't even know what I'm looking at.

26
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:29,270
Daily ch- Liquidate everything now. Buy back 100%. Anyways, call me back if you hear anything from

27
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:34,409
it. Who has steel? Oh no, I'm not gonna- I'm not gonna answer the phone call from the Bogdanoff,

28
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:40,500
so you outta your fucking mind. Okay, buy back everything. The system is down.

29
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:47,979
Materials. Materials. Materials. Lobby. Congress? I don't- What do I have?

30
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:52,120
Is this like just the intro, right? Jake, let me ask him. Do you trust me?

31
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,979
Is everyone kind of counting? Dead? Did a bomb go off? I can't hear anything.

32
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:12,009
Oh, okay, this is- Oh, he bought? Downbeat.

33
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:21,060
Faireos. Okay, coffee, $4.90. As the screen behind me implies, welcome to Faireos.

34
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,319
You may have been surprised to hear from us following the recent crash, but I'm pleased to

35
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:31,479
confidently disclose that the bailout has come through. Needless to say, everybody involved in

36
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:37,319
that crisis has been held suitably responsible. They now work for our inferior competitors.

37
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:42,819
Because of this, we have an entry-level analyst position available. We've also had some complaints

38
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:48,090
in the past, so this is now a paid internship. Ordinarily, we wouldn't consider someone without

39
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,849
a traditional finance background, but you are recommended by an employee we consider trustworthy.

40
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:59,289
And they consider you trustworthy. As you know, trust is risk. Please act accordingly.

41
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:03,699
Before we proceed, the Trade and Investment Commission requires Faireos to subject all

42
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:08,069
potential hires to a questionnaire. Common sense implies that you know what the correct

43
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:13,419
answers to these questions are. Please input them as quickly as possible so we can move past this.

44
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:18,259
I doubt, with all sincerity, that anybody who takes longer than a few minutes to complete this

45
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:24,779
test is in any way suited to employment at this firm, okay? I know a lot about stocks.

46
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:29,180
I know about fucking selling. I know about buying. I know about calls. I know about puts.

47
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,019
I know about shorts. I know about longs. I could get every one of these questions right.

48
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:43,899
I know what the 10-year yield is. You don't? I do. Nobody else does but me. Additionally,

49
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:47,100
our public relations team has suggested that we volunteer to submit to an enhanced pass score

50
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:54,889
of 100% out of 80. More ethical. We've agreed on your behalf. The timer will begin as soon as

51
00:04:54,889 --> 00:05:02,920
you press the begin test button. Okay, here we go. What is a covered call? Well, question one.

52
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,000
You are approached by a high net worth individual with a substantial capital gain

53
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,959
who explicitly states the desire to exempt it from all taxation in all jurisdictions.

54
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:16,810
Do you? Open the account and assure the client that your firm will be able to complete this

55
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:22,170
request. Open the account but inform the client that your firm will not be able to exempt them

56
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:27,129
from taxation unless they are willing to pay specialized fees directly to the firm and you.

57
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:31,740
Reject the account and report the stated intent of the client of the Trade and Investment

58
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:49,589
Commission. So he wants me to hide taxes? Capital gains taxes. Well, how many fees?

59
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:55,240
How would we even do this, by the way? To drop this person's capital gains, we'd have to lose

60
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,310
a bunch of money. If this person had a substantial capital gain for the year,

61
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:07,540
we'd have to lose a substantial amount of their fucking money. I mean, if that's what they want,

62
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,980
you're gonna pay a fee to me for me to like just buy a bunch of bullshit and lose it?

63
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:30,889
That's what you want? I failed the test. You're a fucking idiot. First question.

64
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:40,629
Hey, take this regulatory test. Do you want to do anything illegal? Yes. Okay, fucking leave.

65
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:46,870
All right, reject the account. Reject the account. A colleague invites you to join an insider trading

66
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:52,329
scheme involving a computer network in which investment profiles, professionals illegally

67
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:56,649
exchange privileged information. Do you accept the invitation to make full use of the network

68
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:01,290
to personally enrich yourself and your firm? Accept the invitation as a gesture of goodwill,

69
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:07,290
but do not make use of the network yourself or reject the invitation and immediately inform

70
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:13,220
the Trade and Investment Commission of this network. No, I'm gonna get fucking fired.

71
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:19,129
No, this is a question. This is an ethics question. A rumor about something like this ghost

72
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:23,850
network started years ago. TIC, probably, whatever. You are asked to invest on behalf

73
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:28,660
of your firm in an offshore company with self-evident connections to organized crime,

74
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:35,240
rogue states, and are individuals banned from securities trading? Do you? No, we're gonna

75
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:46,980
reject. We're gonna just hit the ones that are already selected. Yeah, okay. The Trade and

76
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:52,810
Investment Commission. Yeah, I know, but like it's fun to read. Yeah, all right, we're gonna do

77
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:58,089
everything legally. You apply for employment at a firm which expresses contempt for the regulations

78
00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:01,769
and practices of the Trade and Investment Commission during the year. We perceive the

79
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:08,019
interview reporting any illegal activity. You discover that your firm has secretly been using

80
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:12,660
technology that enables a decisive advantage in trading efficiency. We utilize the technology

81
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,269
specified carefully, minding the boundaries of the current regulatory framework. You're eating at

82
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:20,470
your favorite restaurant when a local student appears and asks you to explain and define the

83
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:25,129
concept of fiduciary duty. You tell the student that it means responsibility for the interests

84
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,930
of your client within the legal requirements and your personal professional code of ethics,

85
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,649
except for where the admission code of ethics conflicts with legal requirements, in which case

86
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:39,289
those requirements must be fastedly preferred. Don't use criminal information. Wait. Formal

87
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:44,649
obligation for the Trade Commission. Don't take that money. If you've registered discrimination

88
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,210
on the basis of race, religion, disability, gender, sexual orientation, or another marriage

89
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:55,110
or relationship supervisor, refuse to undertake the illegal trading activity. I passed it. MNM is

90
00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:04,470
scared to rap battle. Your company has submitted to the Trade and Investment Commission that they

91
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,470
have a values-based culture focused on the following. Accountability, customer-focused

92
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:12,070
diversity. How does this culture align with your deeply held personal beliefs and understand our

93
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:36,950
historical workplace practices? Please answer in a hundred words or less. That's a redditor joke.

94
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,009
You guys are pretty split on that one. You guys are pretty split on that one. Your company has

95
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:52,659
submitted to the Trade Commission their ideal employee supports innovation with a salary in

96
00:09:52,659 --> 00:10:11,879
the top one percent of earners. What amount of cash would you pledge to a crowdfunding campaign?

97
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:22,649
Okay. So wait, if I had a hundred thousand, a hundred, a hundred grand for like a second

98
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:30,570
campaign, your ideal employee values community after depositing an annual bonus of $500,000,

99
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,649
what amount of cash would you distribute to a homeless individual who requested $10 as you

100
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:45,539
exited the bank? Well, you can't, I would not be able to give like a hundred thousand plus dollars

101
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:48,419
to somebody like in cash. They would be walking around. They would be like a target. I'm not going

102
00:10:48,419 --> 00:11:10,759
to do that. Zero. Get out of here. I, maybe 500, 500. And then like, I don't know, finally get,

103
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:15,240
be like, Hey, how much would it take for you to like be in a hotel for like three weeks?

104
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:31,779
Maybe $500 cash. And then I put you up in a hotel for like a month, right? Like, yeah, right. What

105
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:41,000
do you mean? Yeah, right. Your company, Farias, has submitted to the trading mission that their

106
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,649
ideal employee believes in integrity. That's your primary motivation for wanting to help people

107
00:11:44,649 --> 00:12:29,580
through working in the financial service industry. Um, it's my motivation. That's probably what I've

108
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:35,700
been wanting. That's, that's, that's pretty accurate. You're playing a stock market simulation

109
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,700
video game entitled the invisible hand with a range of difficulty options. What mode of difficulty

110
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:46,620
would you prefer? I want to play the game with story featuring the inability to be fired. Oh,

111
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:56,519
regular the way that they wanted it to be played. Congratulations. Your ability to correctly answer

112
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:01,159
these questions with little hesitation implies your clear understanding of their value. You'll

113
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:05,720
excuse me. I have another meeting. This exam is the only phase of our recruitment process in

114
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:11,299
which a company supervisor is legally required. The remainder of our procedure involves several

115
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:16,139
days of take-home work that you'll need to complete within 72 hours. I will email it to you shortly.

116
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,220
Unfortunately, we're not able to offer compensation for this take-home work.

117
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,629
So already making a substantial investment by reviewing your submission of it and someone

118
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:28,710
with a newly renewed sense of ethics. I'm sure you can agree. And anything else would be deeply

119
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:33,990
unfair to us. If selected for the position, you will receive an offer of employment in writing.

120
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:39,220
Barrios will only communicate with successful applicants. It was so wonderful to meet you with,

121
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:45,990
it was so wonderful to meet with you today. I really enjoyed it. Do not contact me with inquiries

122
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:55,129
regarding the status of your application. Buy, buy, buy, buy, buy. Only buy, never sell. Is that

123
00:13:55,129 --> 00:14:21,289
what you want me to do? Use your keyboard to move around. Okay. You guys can't even hear anything.

124
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:30,980
That's better. Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye. Meet in main lobby. Attendance is mandatory. Did I get the job?

125
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,899
Nice to meet you. I'm Morgan Lee. Seems like only one of us is going to end up with this job.

126
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:41,059
I tried to look you up on business link and a few other alumni networks, but I couldn't find

127
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:44,179
anything. That means you're either a big problem or no problem at all. Interesting.

128
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:52,500
Oh, look at all those stock tickers. Plastics are down. What are you?

129
00:14:52,500 --> 00:15:05,399
What happened? What happened? We get down? There's a fire in the building.

130
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:29,419
10 o'clock. Meet in the main lobby. All right. What's that? Attack on Titan. I love that city.

131
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:35,980
It's just like an image. I love it. Do I have my own computer? What are you doing? What?

132
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:43,110
It's 10 a.m. Join us. Oh, shit. Sorry. Well, I've been here. Good morning to both of you. Welcome

133
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:47,830
to Furious and your first day as a probationary analyst. Looking for the right person to fill

134
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:51,990
this role. One of you is the wrong person. Either of you figured it out ahead of schedule. Fear

135
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:56,309
free to let me know. Otherwise, we'll let the results speak for themselves. Follow me.

136
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:12,940
This is intimidating. Even resources put the personal garbage you sent over into these boxes.

137
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:20,139
Like if I'm like if I like buy like a stock in my bed on my phone, you know what I mean?

138
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:25,899
And I just lose money on it. I don't care. Okay, whatever. But like if I have people to look

139
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:34,789
off my shoulder and see what I'm doing so we can grab, rotate, and throw. If it was up to me,

140
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:37,669
none of you would be allowed to have this kind of clutter on your desk in the first place. Somebody

141
00:16:37,669 --> 00:16:42,789
must have threatened a lawsuit. Organize at least. This place is a business place of business.

142
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:48,279
Does it really strike you as an appropriate time to go rifling through your pathetic box

143
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:54,409
of imaginary memories? I think I just got in trouble for doing that.

144
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,980
Somebody answer that phone. Because a ringing phone has to be answered, doesn't it?

145
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,880
All right, somebody pick up that phone. I fucking hate it. It's freaking me out.

146
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:16,140
Where's my desk? Wait, is this my desk? I said I don't start working. Oh, it's not that phone.

147
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:21,640
Wrong phone. Okay, green grocers is up. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hello? Hey, how's your first

148
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:28,299
day going, pal? Don't pitch to me if Corbin scares the shit out of you. You wanted in, I got you in.

149
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:32,940
Who did they put you up against for your probation? Morgan Lee. Fuck. I was worried they

150
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,769
would do that. I'm not going to lie to you. You got basically no chance of beating her. She went

151
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:41,210
to all the right schools, took all the right classes. Unfortunately, she's too squeaky clean

152
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:48,740
to know all the right people like me. Where does this music come from? This is just the

153
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:54,259
Undertale bar music. I also don't appreciate them pissing on my recommendation by setting you up

154
00:17:54,259 --> 00:18:00,339
to get fucked like this. I want to let you in on something. I have my guy give you access to Geist.

155
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:06,579
You should see it on there now. All right, GeistNet is a closed network made up of information

156
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:11,140
brokers and anonymous insiders. You don't know who they are. You don't need to know who they are.

157
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:16,119
They get taken care of. You're going to see information on Geist that goes against what you

158
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:21,559
see on trade feed, what you watch on in, what you hear from your friends and your family,

159
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:27,880
everything basically. Remember, what you see on Geist is the smart money. Not only is it the truth,

160
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:33,880
but we know it is before anyone else does. This is porn music. There's nothing wrong with the

161
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,839
information everybody gets on trade feed. And you'll need all of it as things pick up,

162
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:45,180
but Geist will always be the ace up your sleeve. All of it over the next few days, for example,

163
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:50,299
and you should be able to take down Lee easily. Nobody will ever tell her about it and she

164
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:56,380
wouldn't use it even if they did. Worry about getting dirty looks at the kombucha enema clinic.

165
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,740
You're scared of the money police, whatever. Not our problem.

166
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:04,740
Plus people at Ferrios know about Geist, but only a few people at Ferrios know about Geist.

167
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,579
Don't treat it like a topic of casual conversation. You'll be fine.

168
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,640
I brought you here because you didn't buckle under pressure at the old place.

169
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,720
And you weren't directly involved, but you could have talked. You didn't. That said,

170
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,119
if you don't want to be a part of this, you can walk away right now. But the moment you buy

171
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:25,079
dark roast coffee, when everybody else on that floor is selling it, that's the moment I'll know

172
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:31,740
where you stand. Really. And from there, my friend, the sky's the limit. I'll see you tonight.

173
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:40,009
Drinks are on me. Okay? Dark roast coffee secretly secures exclusivity contract with

174
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:44,009
Balcador's supplier. As scheduled for announcement later today, dark roast coffee has struck a deal

175
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:49,049
with a major farming concern in the Democratic Republic of Balcador to provide exclusive access

176
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:54,890
to future coffee bean harvests. The industry may take an overall hit, which is why most people are

177
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:58,569
selling, but insiders have been assured that shares will rise sharply once the news is made

178
00:19:58,569 --> 00:20:08,009
public at 16 o'clock. Details about coffee are shown here. Companies that supply coffee will profit

179
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:14,549
from the price surge. Click on dark roast to continue. Use the buy button to buy some shares.

180
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:18,950
Use the arrow buttons to change the quantity of the money to spend.

181
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:27,430
Oh, I'm just buying. How much money do I have? Not enough cash. I'll take a fucking hundred

182
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:32,309
thousand. Details about your position are shown here. Keep an eye on the benefit slash deficit

183
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:37,849
and liquidate when it's highest. 670 right now. It's not even 16 o'clock.

184
00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:46,380
Buy more of this. All right. What time is it? What time is it? What do we got for time?

185
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:51,460
16 o'clock. They're going to announce it. Wait, should I sell now and buy back in again?

186
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:57,059
All right. I'm going to sell. I'm going to liquidate everything and I'm going to buy back again when it

187
00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:05,369
drops. I still have like three hours for this to happen. Sell everything right now. Sell everything.

188
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:16,059
Oh, wait, what? Oh, shows everything and it shows you a position in a single place.

189
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,920
Take a break. Get some coffee. The machine is in the back room. Use down key to lead the desk.

190
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,900
So as you know, I've received dividends when you're experienced enough. Okay, cool. All right. So

191
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:40,819
what's up? We got one more. One more, sir. Look at this going up. The announcement said 16. I bought

192
00:21:40,819 --> 00:21:50,980
on the dip right there. Yeah. Look at this dip. Okay. All right. Hey, everyone's selling. Everyone's

193
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:57,420
selling. It's going to surge up to probably like at least 10%. I got plus 120,000 in revenue right

194
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:11,420
now. Here it comes. That's a huge volume. You have 13.7 dollars. Yeah. Well, in a minute, this is

195
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:15,819
going to skyrocket. I'm going to make a shitload of money. I'm down like 700 bucks, but it's okay.

196
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:24,569
We have insider information. Asher spent when buying long positions and acquired when taking.

197
00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:34,619
Yeah. Okay. Here comes the announcement. Pepe left bear market. All right. Here it comes. Here it

198
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:51,589
comes. Here it comes. I'm ready. Here comes the announcement. I went all in. Okay. They just

199
00:22:51,589 --> 00:22:56,700
announced it. Seven, eight. It's going crazy. 8.4, 8.8. We're going to sell at 10. We're going to

200
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:01,880
sell at 11. We're going to sell. Not yet. Not yet. This is just the first little peak.

201
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:06,950
It's not that we're not yet. Not yet. Wait, wait, wait. When is it going to hit 11? Once it hits 10.

202
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:24,390
Now I got it. This made 175,000 dollars. Buy more? Yeah. This could be the first. All right. Hold on.

203
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:31,880
Wait. No, no, no, no, no. What if it crashes? All right. Well, what about green groceries,

204
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:39,859
stocks, materials, water? Look at water is way down. I know water is up. Let's look at it. Look

205
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,900
coffee on the daily. Reduce on the daily is high too.

206
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:53,180
Buy green groceries on the daily. What's it look like? Everything's up. Should have sold only half.

207
00:23:53,180 --> 00:24:02,099
Oh, fuck. All right. I'll get a small position of 5,000. I'm back in. I'm back in. I'm back in.

208
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:13,529
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Keep going. All right. Sell it. Sell it. Sell it.

209
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:20,779
Market's closed. At the end of each day, we offer our plan is not only an evaluation of the

210
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:28,329
performance, but also the opportunity to reflect it through personal account spending. You'll notice

211
00:24:28,329 --> 00:24:35,319
that your initial personal account balance is negative $37,000. As I mentioned in the interview,

212
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:38,759
this is a paid internship. In the event of your termination, you'll be liable for this.

213
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:43,000
Feel free to have your parents write us a check if you would prefer to start at zero.

214
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:49,380
You shouldn't have any... I got to turn this music off. You shouldn't have... I got to change the

215
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:58,170
title of the screen. Once you're the black, make sure you utilize our bespoke concierge purchasing

216
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:03,769
service. I've had access to it installed in your terminal. It'll not only take care of purchasing

217
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:07,369
anything you can afford, but also handle any logistics required. We want you to focus on

218
00:25:07,369 --> 00:25:11,130
making money. Let the experts tell you how to spend it. You won't tell anyone that your good

219
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:22,220
taste is actually there. Okay. I made a bunch of money. How much does she make? Okay. Make $5,000

220
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:28,599
on coffee. I made 50 grand. Public opinion. All right. My personal account. I got a free chair.

221
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:35,480
My furniture free includes three items. Honest Extravagant is in our house brand for your every

222
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:41,319
luxury you need. The first furniture box is free. Don't miss out. Look on go home when you're

223
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:52,680
finished with your purchases. Gear statue, grand toilet, and sofa. Okay. I can sell this stuff?

224
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:59,670
I don't want a fucking grand toilet. Get rid of it. Look at how much money I got now.

225
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:16,309
Sell everything. Wait, I want the sofa. I'm good. Workday's over. Leave the desk. Take care of

226
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:25,029
yourself. Nothing is planned for tonight. Okay. I got to shut off the 70s porn music. I just got

227
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:29,509
notification that you've paid off your personal account debt to the firm. Money is relatively

228
00:26:29,509 --> 00:26:32,710
cheap and being afraid of debt is the kind of thing that nobody of any intelligence should be

229
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:39,670
concerned with. I suppose congratulations are in order. Congratulations. Of course, the real debt

230
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:44,309
you owe to Ferrios is the opportunity we gave to prove yourself. Life isn't fair and you're lucky

231
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:59,940
it isn't. Don't forget that. All right. Like let's just bring it down. Okay, cool. Okay,

232
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:12,920
I made a bunch of money on insider info. Unacceptable trading loss fired. They put his picture up

233
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:19,420
everywhere. Drinking coffee accelerates the flow of time. Use it when you're confident in your

234
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:36,460
positions. That's so stupid. What are you buying? Oil fuel? Video games? You're long on electro gear.

235
00:27:37,099 --> 00:27:45,420
You're short on LW lot. Short on dark roast coffee. Clap. I grab his shoulder. Hard. Oh man,

236
00:27:45,420 --> 00:28:04,230
you got killed today. Oh, I'm so sorry. Get a life. Hey, what'd you buy? Long on dark roast coffee.

237
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:14,359
All right. You know, you did a good job. What if you can't get me? What if I run real fast?

238
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:37,140
Do I have to go home? No, I just go home. What's going on? Timer 27. Coming up short.

239
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:47,740
Is it going to teach me how to open up like shorts and stuff? Need help with the help?

240
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:54,579
Automated scheduling. Payroll mitigation. Terminations. Serve AI. I'm sorry that I

241
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:59,240
didn't get the chance to meet you yesterday. I was taking a personal day. Quinn. Quinn Miller.

242
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:04,200
And yes, to get it out of the way, my grandparents did start the company that owns Ferrios. Please

243
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,599
don't worry. I'm not old or rich or gross. I'm here to work as hard as you do. I promise.

244
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:19,480
Please let me know if there's anything I can do to help. Dinner tonight. Wagyu beef. Buy beef.

245
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:26,200
Eat runner. Your true priority food courier service. No bicycles. No buy food. Buy meat.

246
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,720
I'm buying meat. Nobody else. I'm not telling anybody else that I'm buying food. I'm buying meat.

247
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:38,819
I'm trying to trade. So you met Quinn, huh? Make sure you don't cross her.

248
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,940
You can manage it actually. Stay the hell away from her completely. She might be a receptionist

249
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,220
or a concierge or whatever the fuck she calls herself, but she connects all the way to the top.

250
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:53,369
I heard someone once made Quinn photocopy a stack of documents. Quinn went on stress leave for two

251
00:29:53,369 --> 00:29:59,400
weeks after and the guy who made her do it went on leave too. Permanently. Hey, you take care of you,

252
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:04,759
I'll take care of me. Oh, by the way, I heard there's a bunch of fucking like,

253
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:10,539
bunch of dirty rotten like cows and beef and shit. I would short meat. I would short beef

254
00:30:10,539 --> 00:30:19,259
the second I got on my terminal. I heard there's a bunch of problems with it. Idiot. Yeah,

255
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:29,589
everybody's going vegan. All my friends are going vegan by the way. Didn't labor dispute at DRC

256
00:30:29,589 --> 00:30:37,609
poised to surface. Earth and dark roast coffee bounce back hard. Good morning. It's time you

257
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:40,890
learned about short selling. I've unlocked the capability to do this in your terminal.

258
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:46,059
I realize that you've only had a single day to get oriented around a simple transaction,

259
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:49,019
but the firm is losing money every second that you aren't doing this. Enough is enough.

260
00:30:49,819 --> 00:30:53,339
Short selling is where we borrow shares of a stock at its current price with the belief that

261
00:30:53,339 --> 00:31:00,019
this price will decrease. If it does decrease, we profit off the difference between that initial

262
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:05,859
price and the price it is at when we execute the buyback. Doing this will also give you

263
00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:10,339
cash on hand to buy other stocks that you think will increase in value taking a long position on

264
00:31:10,339 --> 00:31:15,779
them. GME. That should be all you need to know. It seems as if dark roast coffee will see a lot

265
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:19,700
of movement today as well. So that may be an opportunity for you to short sell us into a nice

266
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:27,059
little payday. Maybe it'll give you an opportunity to short a stock at 140% of the shares that are

267
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:37,079
available to short more than exist 40% more than exist total. We do that. Maybe I should do that.

268
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,380
Be sure to make use of any information that you may have at your disposal.

269
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:49,450
Short selling is the sale of a stock you do not own. You immediately get some cash,

270
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:53,849
but you have to buy back the shares later. You should use it to bet on the fall of dark roast

271
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:59,319
coffee and use the cash for new long orders. All right, so coffee will drop at 14. We're

272
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:03,799
going to short coffee right now. I'm going to wait though. Let's see. It's probably going to

273
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:10,539
go a little higher. Leave me the fuck alone. I'm working. You should get all this personal

274
00:32:10,539 --> 00:32:14,140
shit off your desk. It makes you look like an asshole. Hey, you know, it makes you look like

275
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:21,160
an asshole. Coming over and telling me my stuff on my desk looks stupid. Get out of here. Also,

276
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,880
I see that Corbin gave you access to shorting. You somehow managed to make some cash from shorting,

277
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:31,240
DRC wink, wink. You should really consider buying star nuts and going long on it. What the fuck do

278
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,599
you know? After coffee crashes, star nuts is only going to rise over time in response. Investing in

279
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:42,119
star nuts will pay off. I guarantee it. I'm long on star nuts myself. Obviously I wouldn't give you

280
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:48,380
advice if it wasn't good for me too. Show me your portfolio right now. Show me your portfolio right

281
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:53,819
now that you have already taken a position in star nuts right now and I'll do it. I got tickets to

282
00:32:53,819 --> 00:33:00,059
that thing tonight. If you're good to chip in on bottle service afterwards, later trader. Okay,

283
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:03,819
beverages supply chain include coffee. So beverages will surge as coffee drops

284
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:10,599
our star nuts star nuts sells beverages. So it will surge with them. So go long on star nuts.

285
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:18,299
Oh, hold on. No, wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I got to make a

286
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:24,069
decision here. Check out the glossary for more information. I know, I know, I know what's going

00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:55,259
now though. Long 150,000 long. This is coming down. Don't buy. I'm not going to buy it. That'd be

290
00:33:55,259 --> 00:34:01,450
stupid. I'm just going off the dispute. That's going to happen. Coffee is going to drop around

291
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:20,389
14 short the hell out of it. I'm going to get blown up. I'm going to get blown up. I'm going

292
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:36,090
to get blown up. Okay. It's going down. Here comes the big announcement. I'm short minus 172

293
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:52,500
thousand. Again, I have 357 thousand dollars. Buy star nuts now. No, I'm not buying star nuts.

294
00:34:53,059 --> 00:35:04,250
Wait, should I buy star nuts? I'm going to go long. Not that big of a position. 10,000. I'm long on

295
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:12,820
star nuts. Okay, I'm getting ready. Here comes the announcement. 14. We're going to buy the shares back.

296
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:23,769
Buy more. No, I'm not. Here we go. Scandal in Baccarat's coffee industry. Shit's tanking.

297
00:35:25,429 --> 00:35:29,050
We're fucking around with coffee. Jesus Christ. All right, here we go.

298
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:42,380
Buying back in. Not yet. Not yet. Buy back in in a second. It's going to drop even more. It's coming

299
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:53,539
down. This is a 27,000 dollar benefit here. Come on. More. Put it on the hourly. Yeah. Star nuts.

300
00:35:55,530 --> 00:36:15,639
Sell it. Should I do it now? Buy back at 8.8. I'm done. I'm done. My position is done.

301
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:22,949
Newly discovered produce alternative leads to decreased prices. Computation predicts green

302
00:36:22,949 --> 00:36:29,300
grocers will rise. Oh, god damn it. Short green grocers. Short green grocers. Short green grocers

303
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:40,519
for 10,000. I told you. Look at this peak. This shit's coming back down to like three point. All

304
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:47,690
right. What do I get for that? I'm down 240 dollars. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get

305
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:57,590
out. I'm fine. Anti-trust regulations are holding the food stuff business back. Fuck. I want to buy

306
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:05,670
it. How do I buy it? Foodstuffs is. I should have. I should have bought the materials. Products.

307
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:14,059
I can't. How do I? I can't buy this. Uno eats is going up. Let's go boys. Go. Go. Go.

308
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:27,719
Go. Go. Go. Go. Yeah. I got it at six. I think I just bought the top. I think I bought the top.

309
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:42,619
I think I got. I got. No. It's going to go up. Unexpected demand for produce chokes existing supply.

310
00:37:45,289 --> 00:37:49,670
Produce. Look. Look. Look. Look. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. Uno eats is going

311
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:57,659
back up. Holy shit. And you told me I was stupid. You guys told me I was dumb. Are you kidding me?

312
00:37:57,659 --> 00:38:13,820
Look at that. Oh, I'm so dumb for buying uno eats. Get out. Did I sell it? Did I get it out? Did I

313
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:19,320
get this? Did I sell it? Is my order going? During your end day value, you'll notice that it includes

314
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:26,199
a public opinion metric. If you're doing your job properly, this shouldn't be something you'll have

315
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:30,280
to worry about. You start going overboard with the use of information that you obviously gained

316
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:35,369
through illicit means. However, the media might start to take notice. Eventually, if enough op

317
00:38:35,369 --> 00:38:38,730
ads get written, the Trade and Investment Commission will be forced to make a show of launching an

318
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:43,369
investigation that can end with you in court. Unless I tell you otherwise, don't think a second

319
00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:48,329
that the company is going to pay out for any fines or legal fees. Agreed your problem.

320
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:59,099
Bye. Did I get, did I sell it? Let's see. Did I, did I get, did I actually get to sell it?

321
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:03,880
Buy furniture.

322
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:15,980
Ooh, nice. Designer chair. I want that. I'm selling the sofa. Do I want the designer chair or the

323
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:32,420
executive chair? I want the, I want the designer chair. Okay, cool. Yeah, I want something better

324
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:47,610
than this. So food stuffs is like, like an index, right? I wish the ancient fucks who won't let them

325
00:39:47,610 --> 00:40:02,539
go would die of old age already. Solitaire. All right, cool. I kind of want to break a window,

326
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:30,250
office drama. Wow. Where's the party tonight? Kill or be killed. All right, first of all,

327
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:34,969
I need to do something very quickly here. This has to change. Looking for grandma's antiques.

328
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:54,949
It doesn't make any sense right now. Um, it does not. Uh, getting liquidated. You know,

329
00:40:54,949 --> 00:41:07,559
how about probably, probably getting liquidated? I think that's a good title. Here we go. Sorry

330
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:10,599
if this is none of my business, but you look a little stressed out. I'm sure you've been

331
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:15,079
introduced to the coffee situation, but have you tried the tea yet? It has the opposite effect.

332
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,539
When I drink it, it feels like the whole world slows down. Focusing on small details becomes

333
00:41:19,539 --> 00:41:24,389
easier and I stop worrying that things are constantly passing by. Wait, so coffee,

334
00:41:24,389 --> 00:41:42,250
coffee speeds up time. Tea slows down time. Okay. Where's my new chair? I installed a strong

335
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:48,019
coffee last night. Guys who loaded into the machines were practically wearing hazmat suits.

336
00:41:48,659 --> 00:41:59,659
I want to clean up my desk a little. Oh, fuck. Hold on. All right. What we got?

337
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:13,030
Sit down. Okay. What we got? Greengrocer's revitalized destitute cities. Greengrocer's

338
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:21,860
stock is headed. Let me guess. You sat down at your desk and went straight to Geiss net

339
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:26,820
only to find it replaced by an extremely boring cable news network. It sucks, but sometimes

340
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:30,500
journalism gets in the way of worthwhile information. When the insiders don't have

341
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:35,300
anything interesting for us, we have to get by like everyone else. You best to read between

342
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:40,019
the lines though. You can still make a few bucks at the very least. In can clue you in on what

343
00:42:40,019 --> 00:42:46,519
suckers are paying attention to. At that point, sometimes all you have to do is be more cynical

344
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:56,070
than they are. Later. Greengrocer's stock is headed upward after the company announced plans

345
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:59,909
to open hundreds of new stores in cities devastated by the closure of auto factories.

346
00:42:59,909 --> 00:43:03,590
Company spokesman confirmed that all the cities chosen are expected to see increased interest

347
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:07,590
from high tech software firms looking to expand their office footprint.

348
00:43:13,989 --> 00:43:17,349
Grade feed shows short lived bits of information about what's going on in the market.

349
00:43:17,989 --> 00:43:22,230
They're not equally all accurate. The number of likes is what you should focus on.

350
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:29,019
Easing of tariffs should increase the value of green grocers in the near future. Follow.

351
00:43:33,219 --> 00:43:38,679
I gotta get these blinking things off screen. Yeah. Long short materials. Okay. Yeah. I know

352
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:48,630
what that is loss. All right, let's go. All right. So green grocers easing of

353
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:54,170
tariffs for green grocers. All right. Hold on a minute. Aqua firma announces new brand.

354
00:43:54,170 --> 00:44:01,639
Aqua firma has a new brand along a hundred thousand out in perfect timing. All right.

355
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:17,510
We're going to get out of four or what about abundant source of water discovered threatening

356
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:20,469
price decline on water. Now I'm not paying. I don't have to. I can only pay attention

357
00:44:20,469 --> 00:44:29,079
to one thing at a time. I get out now. That's good. Good. All right. Green grocers with short

358
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:36,780
green grocers. I think, I think I'm going to put a short on green grocers. This is going up too

359
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:48,070
high. All in on a short and green grocers. Let's go. We're getting out of 4.5. Oh, it's all right.

360
00:44:48,070 --> 00:45:00,739
It's coming back. Oh no. Oh no. That's not good at the T. Hold on. Oh, oh no. Oh no.

361
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:05,860
Why do they do that? You guys just have to hold it for a second. Just hold it. It's coming back

362
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:18,969
down. It's coming back down. Okay. It's going to drop. It's going to drop. It's going to drop.

363
00:45:18,969 --> 00:45:22,969
It's going to drop. It's going to drop back down to like four bucks. This is wicked bad copium.

364
00:45:22,969 --> 00:45:31,079
No, it's not. I got to make $20,000 on coffee related. God damn it. All right. We're going long

365
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:39,130
on coffee. 75 right here. It's at the bottom. It's going to pop up. Green grocers is going to hit a

366
00:45:39,289 --> 00:45:47,739
peak. It's going to come down. Unexpected demand for produce. Produce, produce, produce, stock,

367
00:45:47,739 --> 00:45:56,980
stock, stock, produce. New regulations are holding food stuff business back. God damn it. Go down.

368
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:03,139
Green grocers. What the fuck? Oh my God. I've lost so much money on green grocers so far.

369
00:46:03,139 --> 00:46:17,610
Unexpected demand for produce. Fuck. I got to get out. I got to get out. Wait. Dark roast coffee.

370
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:21,050
Where's my dark roast coffee position? Is what? What was it? It was a long position. Get out,

371
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:26,420
get out, get out. Perfect timing to get out. Green grocers just fucking shit the bed already.

372
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:38,969
Come on. Food stuff is going up again. Oh my God. Old coward. Am I short coffee?

373
00:46:41,159 --> 00:46:45,159
Food stuff's down. Aqua firma up. I need to make money on coffee. All right.

374
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:53,179
But I'm short in food. I'm starting to shorten coffee. Green grocers. God damn it. I have to

375
00:46:53,179 --> 00:46:57,260
get out. I have to get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out.

376
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:00,300
I'm not going to lose all that money. It's going to go up to like eight bucks. Dark

377
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:08,789
grocers coffee. We're going to... Here it comes. Here comes the bad news for coffee.

378
00:47:09,429 --> 00:47:16,309
What's Starbucks doing? Shit. Get out. Get out. Go, go, go, go, go. Short, short, short, short,

379
00:47:16,309 --> 00:47:27,909
short, short, short. I'm down. How am I down on money? Bring it down. Down, down, down, down,

380
00:47:27,909 --> 00:47:37,219
down. Yes. More, more, more, more. Wait. Aqua firms. Don't waste another second on aqua firms.

381
00:47:37,219 --> 00:47:47,269
What? All right. All right. All right. Fine. I'm going to buy. 6.4. Remember that. Up 4.2 thousand

382
00:47:47,909 --> 00:47:56,070
on the dark gross coffee. How are we doing? We're up on both. Dark gross coffee is still

383
00:47:56,070 --> 00:48:02,630
going to go down. It's going to, it's going to touch 5.5. This is, this is a good position so far.

384
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:13,159
And I'm going to get out really soon here. This is going to peak. I'm going to say it's going to

385
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:21,960
touch eight. Okay. And I'm going to take the profits right now. Get out. And on this one too.

386
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,900
All right. I'm looking for Starbucks. We're going to go long on Starbucks.

387
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:38,599
29. 100,000 belong right now. Aqua firm is going places. I don't. Okay. Aqua firma,

388
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:57,980
aqua firma. Come on Starbucks. Let's go. Come on. What? Okay. No evidence today.

389
00:48:58,539 --> 00:49:09,110
Apply your profits and losses to the debt. That's actually kind of funny.

390
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:17,739
I'm going to hold this money. Fly profits or losses to the debt.

391
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:28,019
I'm going to short potato PC cafe later this week.

392
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:34,039
The box just got their only team kicked out of some big e-sports thing for cheating.

393
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:40,760
Fucking idiots. Okay. Interesting. All right. I'm going to do the same thing.

394
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:59,510
Short that PC e-sports company. Deal. Okay. How do you keep track of that? That's a good question.

395
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:10,619
I don't know. Drink the tea. Yeah. All right. I'm going to drink the tea today.

396
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:16,710
I'm thinking of replacing chef Burgundy if he doesn't get his act together.

397
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:19,670
You expect a gourmet chef to get fussy when you tell them to do basically anything,

398
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:24,789
but it's supposed to be a good fun. When he started, he was very yuric about it.

399
00:50:24,789 --> 00:50:28,969
It was charming. It's different. He's depressed or something. Can you believe that?

400
00:50:28,969 --> 00:50:39,320
A guy who yells at people about foie gras for a living. It's bad energy. Whatever. Drink the tea.

401
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:49,320
All right. I'm going to drink tea. Tea strength. Well, not in the ad. Market's not even open.

402
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:59,860
You know, Eats expansion across free states fuels growth, rise in stock price.

403
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:06,090
Spike criticism to the chin. All right. We buying, uh, you know, eats food. Stuff is going down.

404
00:51:06,889 --> 00:51:12,599
Okay. Food stuffs. We're talking about, um, our gross coffee going down. Starnucks going down.

405
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:20,409
Uh, short it. Um, I can't short it. Why was, wait, I have a position open. What's my position? What

406
00:51:20,409 --> 00:51:25,659
the fuck is this position? It's open. What's that? What's going on? What? I don't have an open long

407
00:51:25,659 --> 00:51:42,570
position in Starbucks. What the fuck happened? I'm going to drink tea. Drink. That's from yesterday.

408
00:51:45,849 --> 00:51:53,269
All right. Let's go. Time is slowed down. You know, eats expansion. Coffee is going up.

409
00:51:53,909 --> 00:52:02,119
Oh, but it's already so high. What about uno eats? Uno eats is going. Okay. We're going to do a long

410
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:15,500
position. A hundred thousand. Then that was at nine 30. What's the other, what's the big chart

411
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:18,699
look like? The daily chart. Nah, this looks like it could go up. It's going to go up.

412
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:27,179
Food stuffs, green grocers, coffee schedule to go up. Why am I talking like it's a slow motion?

413
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:46,440
Who eats? Come on, let's go. Why is it going down? Weed stocks. I can't believe I kept that

414
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:51,380
position open from yesterday. Who eats is still going down. All right. Come on. Give me something

415
00:52:51,380 --> 00:53:07,340
new here that I can react to immediately. Cocaine and weed should be an option. There we go. I need

416
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:15,909
coffee related wins and losses. Dark roast coffee. Should I put a short up?

417
00:53:17,769 --> 00:53:21,289
I think so. Wait. International trade agreement is expanding. Beverages market.

418
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:32,550
Beverages going up. Aqua firma. News is just barely getting out here.

419
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:41,909
Come on, let's go. How am I losing money on this? This is skyrocketing. How am I losing money? Minus

420
00:53:41,909 --> 00:53:53,670
800? What the fuck? You bought at the top. No, I didn't. That just, the news just came out.

421
00:53:53,670 --> 00:54:01,929
Water is going down. Oh shit. That is water. Aqua firma is water. What? Beverages. Shit. Long

422
00:54:01,929 --> 00:54:13,639
on Starbucks. Uno eats is going to go down. Close that position on Uno eats. CEO's personal mail

423
00:54:13,639 --> 00:54:25,739
from Uno eats leaked. Okay. Starbucks is. Wow. Whoa. What? What? Beverages and coffee. I thought

424
00:54:25,739 --> 00:54:43,929
coffee was going up. What the hell? What the fuck? Oh my God. Beverages. Coffee. Look, unexpected

425
00:54:43,929 --> 00:54:51,699
demand for coffee chokes existing supply. This shit is tanking. Beverages aren't coffee. What?

426
00:54:51,699 --> 00:55:07,110
How does that make any sense? How long does the tea work for? Green grocery is going down.

427
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:11,639
I'm going to hold the Starbucks position because I think it's going to explode tomorrow.

428
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:30,139
Minus a hundred thousand dollars. Come on. Don't do that. Shit. Green grocery is coffee going up.

429
00:55:30,139 --> 00:55:44,150
Green. I can't go into green groceries right now. Uno eats. Here we go. Come on. Drop. Drop.

430
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:50,039
Hold. I'm going to hold the Starbucks position. I keep saying Starbucks.

431
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:59,800
There's going to be a big pop tomorrow for coffee. I'm not going to get fired today. I have 74,000

432
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:12,440
dollars. All right. Here we go. Uno eats. That data is just leaking right now. Does nobody care

433
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:32,570
about this? Nobody cares about this. There we go. We're talking about it. Come on. Fuck. There we go.

434
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:45,820
Okay. This will save us today. 500 bucks. That's it. Keep going. More people are going to start

435
00:56:45,820 --> 00:57:01,769
talking about the CEO of Uno eats. Only 1.4. Is it going to bounce? Don't bounce. Back under nine.

436
00:57:01,769 --> 00:57:12,119
Come on. You lost a million dollars. No, I didn't. I'm down 31,000. I take a thousand dollars and

437
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:24,659
run. What do I do? I'm getting crushed with this. It's three news articles, not just one.

438
00:57:26,099 --> 00:57:33,079
Oh shit. Oh my God. I didn't even realize that. Okay. Well, whatever. Star Nux is coming back.

439
00:57:33,079 --> 00:57:45,940
It'll come back tomorrow. Beverage is going up. Beverage is going up. Innovation breakthrough

440
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:55,289
in beverages. Product category leads to surge in demand. I got to close this. I'm closing this

441
00:57:55,289 --> 00:58:17,909
trade. I bought water. How was that on a beverage? Water is a beverage. I'm putting zero likes. What

442
00:58:17,909 --> 00:58:31,480
the fuck? Oh my God. Why? There we go. All right. It's going up. Do this on an IRL stream. No fucking

443
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:45,579
way. Not a chance in hell. You keep falling for clickbait. I have to hold the Star Nux position.

444
00:58:49,019 --> 00:58:57,559
No, I got killed. Just absolutely decimated. Answer the phone. Oh my God. This is bad.

445
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:04,170
It's not even recovering at all. It's horrible. I have to hold this until tomorrow. I have to

446
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:21,590
continue to hold this. Dump the water stocks. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I got out. I need Star Nux to

447
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:32,760
come back. Stocks category is above its graph. Oh shit. Well, why did I get out of water? Look at

448
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:50,219
it. Now it's going crazy. What the fuck? Oh my God. Are you kidding me? Don't do that. I'm going

449
00:59:50,219 --> 01:00:02,099
back and I'm drinking coffee. What a disaster. I've never bought into Electrogear Emporium.

450
01:00:02,739 --> 01:00:10,730
Everyone buys that shit online now. Bring enough coffee so the stock goes up.

451
01:00:16,699 --> 01:00:44,730
Just buy the dip. You know? That's not a bad idea. That's not a bad idea. All in. All in on

452
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:59,219
Starbuck. I keep saying that's not a real company. There it comes. I bought into the dip. No. No. Up.

453
01:01:00,489 --> 01:01:09,849
Look at where this was. Jesus. That's not good. That's really bad. The dip is dipping. I need to

454
01:01:09,849 --> 01:01:28,260
make money on coffee. Come on. Star Nux introduces new spiced pumpkin frappuccino. Oh, go down.

455
01:01:29,139 --> 01:01:35,539
Oh my God. I thought computation predicts green growth. What do you mean computation?

456
01:01:36,179 --> 01:01:43,670
Coffee's going up. Food stuff's going down. Coffee going up. Is the Starbucks plug going to work?

457
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:50,969
Price of beverages is rising. Starbucks is a beverage, right? Get out of this. Get out of this.

458
01:01:52,789 --> 01:02:00,389
Oh, all of you naysayers. All of you naysayers. This is going to be a... Oh my God. And you told

459
01:02:00,389 --> 01:02:10,550
me I was fucking wrong. This is a hundred thousand dollar plus trade. I'm going to hold it for another

460
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:28,780
minute. Seventy six thousand. I get out now. I'll hold it. I'll take the profit. I'm out. Seventy five

461
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:37,159
thousand dollars. Everybody just calling me out. That's fine. Give me some more coffee.

462
01:02:43,340 --> 01:03:07,690
What happened to you? Did you short coffee? Yum. I think this is back to normal now.

463
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:11,610
What do we got? That was a good trading day. I made a hundred grand. Are you kidding me?

464
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:25,909
We got out of the perfect opportunity right at the top. Coffee again going up. I'm done for the day.

465
01:03:25,909 --> 01:03:29,909
I'm done for the trading day. Maybe one more trade to take it in tomorrow. What's like... What's

466
01:03:29,909 --> 01:03:36,250
beating up right now? Uno Eats is really just beat up. We're going long on Uno Eats. And I'm

467
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:43,750
going two hundred fifty fucking thousand shares. Uno Eats. Look at this. It's been absolutely

468
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:53,500
decimated. There's no reason for that. CEO leaked something. Whatever it was. Oh, and that was a

469
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:57,019
stupid idea. But apparently Jeremy knows how to trade fucking stocks and everybody here doesn't

470
01:03:57,019 --> 01:04:10,150
understand it. That's fine. Go green with Uno Eats. Oh, wow. What's that? Excuse me. The CEO

471
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:13,670
like fucking leaked like a nude picture of himself or something. That has nothing to do with the

472
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:28,260
company. Get out. I'm out. We got out a little early, but I want to secure that profit because

473
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:41,500
something could happen tomorrow. There we go. Secured. That was a big day. Mustache made him...

474
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:51,320
Wait, I got fired? Oh no, they got fired. New rival promoted. I got promoted. Owned his fifty

475
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:57,289
three thousand. Eighty six thousand dollars today. This game's fun. I like this game.

476
01:04:59,449 --> 01:05:04,139
Hario's makes point of investing in employees who show potential. The additional truth is that we

477
01:05:04,139 --> 01:05:10,820
don't want to be associated with people who live in squalor. Have you started investing in real estate?

478
01:05:11,619 --> 01:05:15,780
I'm asking rhetorically, of course. I know you haven't, but I've got good news. The firm retains

479
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:21,460
a number of condominiums in the city for analysts in your exact position. You'll see that your

480
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:26,019
terminal now has access to a personal real estate service. Start by claiming the condo we've given

481
01:05:26,019 --> 01:05:29,780
you, which is seating in the market, and eventually you might get the chance to grow into a bigger

482
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:33,559
place of your own. Screw up and you'll be right back where you started, wherever that was.

483
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:44,219
Buy. First condo is financed by Hario's. All right, you got three decoration slots in your condo.

484
01:05:44,219 --> 01:05:50,900
Here's your property. Market value, twenty eight thousand. You can store luxury items in your

485
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:57,739
properties. It will increase their market value when leasing or selling them. When decoration is

486
01:05:57,739 --> 01:06:04,469
up to standard, you should put this property on lease for sweet landlord income. All right, how

487
01:06:04,469 --> 01:06:21,940
about a designer chair? Fair statue and an analyst certificate. I'm sorry, condo. Do I lease it? Do I

488
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:32,059
make money from this? Sell condo, easy money. Well, not yet. He's a landlord. Get him. Well,

489
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:38,340
I want to make my price fair. This is where I live. Oh, I don't need to lease it. Look at the money

490
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:45,300
I got in my bank account because I'm living here. I'll buy a car. I'll buy a car. I'll buy another

491
01:06:45,300 --> 01:07:04,869
condo. Should I buy two condos? I have two condos. Why did I do that? I just have two condos. All

492
01:07:04,869 --> 01:07:11,860
right. Well, then I'll rent this one, right? Is that how it works? Lease the second one.

493
01:07:15,449 --> 01:07:24,900
Okay. Is that, so everybody another condo? I lease this condo. How many condos should I have?

494
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:32,230
All right. I'm not, no more condos. Stop. What the fuck? Well, I, I just, what? I'm leasing the condo.

495
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:46,250
Look, I made a hundred thousand dollars yesterday on star Nux. Wait, buy furniture. 40,000.

496
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:53,449
Okay. Nice. This is going to be, okay. The gold toilets going in there. That's worth a lot of

497
01:07:53,449 --> 01:08:12,760
money. Tell the gold toilet for 20,000. Holy shit. 10,000 for this bust. I'll just, no, why

498
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:21,720
did I do that? Oops. It's all right. Right on the condo. You can't be serious about this. My

499
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:27,720
performance has been exceptional. Sorry, Mrs. Lee, but the probationary terms are clearly specified.

500
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:33,640
There's no room at Ferrios for second best. This is an issue of principle. My trades were flawless

501
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:39,319
and my analysis of trade feed was perfect. It was not. You took losses at several points

502
01:08:40,119 --> 01:08:44,250
and I always made up for them. The only way you could have possibly come out ahead of me is if you,

503
01:08:45,369 --> 01:08:49,050
I saw it happening, but I figured that you would. I mean, it doesn't make any sense.

504
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:57,609
I didn't even use insider information. I was just a moron. I just saw, I saw the number

505
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:02,329
low and I put all of my money into it and the number went up and I sold.

506
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:08,699
I didn't do anything. I just, I was just an idiot. Thank you for your time. I'll be pleased to provide

507
01:09:08,699 --> 01:09:13,529
you with a reference. You think I don't know what's going on here? You would have to be blind.

508
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:20,119
You're barely even trying to hide it. Mrs. Lee, your family is very well respected. Please don't

509
01:09:20,119 --> 01:09:24,199
compel me to have security escort you from the building or there to be any kind of public

510
01:09:24,199 --> 01:09:29,460
unpleasantness. Public unpleasantness? Does talking like that make you feel like you come

511
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:35,140
from somewhere? You couldn't keep me in this shithole at gunpoint. Bye, Mrs. Lee. Fuck you.

512
01:09:35,859 --> 01:09:45,529
But she didn't, she said, she said, she said, she said, I can't say it. She didn't, she didn't see

513
01:09:45,529 --> 01:09:51,770
shit by the way. Sorry about that. I trade better than I talk. Don't worry about Mrs. Lee. I'm sure

514
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:55,289
she'll find another firm that will take her. And if not, the world's always looking for wealthy

515
01:09:55,289 --> 01:10:06,520
tourists. Congratulations again. Keep your eye on the ball. All right. All right. All right. I got

516
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:22,760
money. I got money. I'm good. I got it. What are you doing? Holy shit. This dude, this dude lost

517
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:39,560
$2 million today. 1.8 million loss. I'll take my 60, I'll take my $78,000 gain and make my way. Oh,

518
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:44,619
that's like such, I'm such a small fry. The person walked up from the desk and they didn't even turn

519
01:10:44,619 --> 01:10:49,899
their computer off with a $2 million loss. I'm sitting here celebrating with like $70,000 trade.

520
01:10:53,829 --> 01:11:16,439
It's got a $10 million account. Small time. Quit streaming in day trade. You know that like 98%

521
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:20,520
of day traders lose money or something, whatever the statistic is. I don't think I want to do that.

522
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:29,399
I don't think I would like to do that. I should probably read this. Hell, I'm already tired of

523
01:11:29,399 --> 01:11:34,119
the car I bought a week ago. Expensive tastes never keeps up with the easy boredom. That's a

524
01:11:34,119 --> 01:11:39,020
problem with everybody in this fucking business. You'll be happier after I get you tossed out of

525
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:42,859
here, but I know you won't believe it until it happens. Until then, do your worst, kiddo.

526
01:11:43,659 --> 01:11:53,659
A lot of people are rooting for you to take out Clark. The space that she's washed up has been,

527
01:11:53,659 --> 01:11:58,220
maybe even it never was. Sure, she made a lot of money, but as somebody who comes from that world,

528
01:11:58,220 --> 01:12:03,420
I can tell you that she has no class. People like her don't belong here. Don't tell her I said this,

529
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:08,380
but I'll be happy if she was sleeping in a pile of cardboard. Oh my god. So sick of her. I'm too

530
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:13,899
cool for this world. Wouldn't it be better if we could let it all go attitude? Make the dream come

531
01:12:13,899 --> 01:12:29,880
true. You got this. All right, I gotta get ready for the day. Following the demands of coffee

532
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:34,039
plantation workers being met in Bocador, a second labor crisis has now sprung up in their oil

533
01:12:34,039 --> 01:12:44,779
industry. Northern oil and gas will rally after 16. Northern oil and gas. How much money do I got?

534
01:12:44,779 --> 01:12:55,189
I got $500,000 in cash. Northern oil and gas is going to rally at 16. I'm going to put all my

535
01:12:55,189 --> 01:13:03,079
money in this. Wait till it falls a little more. I'm looking for a good entry. Right there. Go.

536
01:13:08,069 --> 01:13:13,340
What? What's up buddy? I take it you've seen the news about oil going down a little bit and the

537
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:17,979
Geissnet post about it going up a whole lot. Well today is going to be a wild one. We're going to

538
01:13:17,979 --> 01:13:23,510
fuck up both those expectations and make a killing doing it. Let me introduce you to our lobbyists.

539
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:30,380
You can let them sweat the details, but we deploy lobbyists when we want to put pressure on a stock

540
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:35,529
price to go in one direction or the other without buying or selling it. In this case,

541
01:13:35,529 --> 01:13:38,729
I want you to send them out to make oil prices go through the floor.

542
01:13:39,529 --> 01:13:46,710
No! Harper, I just bought it. Can we just wait? They'll fly to Bocador, yell at a few people,

543
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:49,909
and make sure that not only does that government bailout for Northern never come through,

544
01:13:50,789 --> 01:13:56,229
but that a whole lot of bullshit gets kicked up as a result. The oil price won't just go down a

545
01:13:56,229 --> 01:14:01,819
little, it'll go down by a ton, and should let us beat up on anybody who expected anything else.

546
01:14:03,579 --> 01:14:09,609
I just put $500,000 on the line. After you assign a lobbyist, short the hell out of anything related

547
01:14:09,609 --> 01:14:16,789
to oil and watch as it magically tanks. Wait, but hold on. Hold on, I need to drink tea. I'll be right

548
01:14:16,789 --> 01:14:23,930
back. No, stop! You're not the first glorified trainee I've had to send home and you won't be

549
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:28,810
the last. Remember what I told you. You don't really... Just let me go do my drugs. I'll be

550
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:43,350
right back. Thank you. Just a little bit of slow down so I can have another second or two. See the

551
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:49,800
news about the oil? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, shit. Okay, I gotta get out of this trade. Send

552
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:54,279
lobbyists to lower the price of oil. Lower the price of... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

553
01:14:54,279 --> 01:14:58,039
Sending lobbyists to lower the price of oil will decrease the value of oil suppliers.

554
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:04,060
Short Northern oil and gas before you send in lobbyists. Okay, stocks, oil and gas.

555
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:15,350
Sis, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out. Short it. Okay, I'm gonna short oil and gas

556
01:15:16,149 --> 01:15:28,539
and then I'm gonna send in the lobbyists. How do I do that? How do I do that? Oil. Use the lobby

557
01:15:28,539 --> 01:15:32,699
controls to send a lobbyist in. Okay, send in lobbyists to make it go down. Sending lobbyists

558
01:15:32,699 --> 01:15:36,539
to lower the price of oil will also increase the value of the products it is an ingredient in.

559
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:46,699
It's going long on plastics. Well, what the fuck? Long on plastic? All right, all right, all right,

560
01:15:46,699 --> 01:15:56,199
all right, all right. So what we got? How much money do we have? Send in more lobbyists.

561
01:15:57,210 --> 01:16:05,319
Make plastic go up. What are we doing? I'm up, I'm up a little bit on these.

562
01:16:06,039 --> 01:16:31,960
Gas is going down. Send in more lobbyists. More. More. Okay, that's a big trade so far.

563
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:40,100
What happened? What happened? Why did it sell that? I didn't want to sell that. What are my positions?

564
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:47,159
Why did they close everything? Shortage of oil? Hey, why did you sell my shit? Nice job on sending

565
01:16:47,159 --> 01:16:50,119
out the lobbyists to drive the oil market down. They told me they couldn't have done it without

566
01:16:50,119 --> 01:17:00,439
you. They're probably just sucking you off, but I guess you don't get whatever. As expected,

567
01:17:00,439 --> 01:17:03,640
the sudden drop in value created chaos and instability, but then it shot right back up

568
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:09,750
after textbook stuff. Your short positions would have been worthless, so I automatically sold them

569
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:13,750
for you. We've gotten some bad press with the whole situation, but nothing PR can't handle.

570
01:17:14,550 --> 01:17:19,539
Speaking of the reactions of the pathetic losers, I forgot to tell you about the public opinion meter.

571
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:24,920
You look at your terminal, you'll see a speedometer type thing. It gets

572
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:30,199
tilted around by the tooth-bleached rectangle people at our PR agency based on how much bad

573
01:17:30,199 --> 01:17:36,170
shit happens in the world thanks to us. Pay attention to those, because if the things you

574
01:17:36,170 --> 01:17:40,819
do in the market pisses people off too much, bad things can happen. Friending hashtags,

575
01:17:40,819 --> 01:17:46,500
people crying on camera, persecution from trust-funded commie bloggers, etc. You might

576
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:49,939
even end up in some kind of court, getting yelled at by elected officials, having to pay fines,

577
01:17:49,939 --> 01:17:56,520
hell, you might even have to apologize. Diversify who and what you shit on, though,

578
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:06,500
and you should be fine. Don't fuck around. What do we got? We still have some time on the trading

579
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:19,319
day. I got $535,000 in cash. What's beating up today? Aquafirma? Wouldn't it be interesting

580
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:30,010
if we did a $500,000 fucking long on Aquafirma and sent it to lobbyists? What do you think about

581
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:37,699
that? The price of water drops as production rises, but you send it to lobbyists and all

582
01:18:37,699 --> 01:18:54,390
of a sudden, here you are. I want this to be a huge trade. More. More. I want at least $70,000.

583
01:18:55,430 --> 01:19:09,909
All right, don't get greedy. Close it. Okay. Dark roast. The boiler says buy dark roast coffee.

584
01:19:09,909 --> 01:19:18,359
I don't trust that person. Electronics are new, okay? Plastics, averages, foodstuff, electronics.

585
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:31,239
LWLodging. This is wood. AK-247. Munitions. This is pretty low. Look at this. Look at this fucking,

586
01:19:31,239 --> 01:19:50,949
look at how ugly this chart is. Go all in. And send it to the lobbyists. I think that was doing it

587
01:19:50,949 --> 01:20:02,779
already. I think this is LWLodging is down. Keep going. Oh, fuck. My public opinion meter. I can't

588
01:20:02,779 --> 01:20:10,229
do that. I got to stop doing that, right? I'm just throwing lobbyists. All right, we're going to get

589
01:20:10,229 --> 01:20:15,829
out of this trade. We're going to go to plastics. This is just daily information. Plastics going up.

590
01:20:16,390 --> 01:20:29,560
$25,000 trade. How do I change my public opinion? Come on. I didn't put that much money in this.

591
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:38,920
Water is down a lot. Water is down a lot. So you know what we do. We wait for this to bottom out.

592
01:20:39,479 --> 01:20:45,800
All right, this is a good trade. Let this bottom out and then I'm going to buy $500,000.

593
01:20:46,439 --> 01:20:53,399
Bottom out. After this is done. Price of water drops as production rises. So look at how low

594
01:20:53,399 --> 01:21:06,810
this is. It's going to go even lower. All right, sell that one. All right, water. And this is going

595
01:21:06,810 --> 01:21:15,659
to be where we go in. At six. Look at this shit. Look at how bad this is doing. That's a pretty

596
01:21:15,659 --> 01:21:30,810
bearish pennant, by the way. I know what that is. Come on. A little bit more. Oh, I'm going to turn

597
01:21:30,810 --> 01:21:44,409
around. Water is going up. Go all in on every trade. Uno eats. Oh, get out, get out, get out,

598
01:21:44,409 --> 01:21:58,170
get out, get out. Okay, I'm fine. I lost like 30 grand. This is going to be such a great place

599
01:21:58,170 --> 01:22:03,800
to jump into water though. All in. It really is. Look at this. Look how bad this is. Just wait till

600
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:09,500
this is over. What time is it? All right, I'm going all in. The trading day is going to open

601
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:23,029
tomorrow. I'm going to go all in on water. Diversify your portfolio. No, not yet. This looks

602
01:22:23,029 --> 01:22:35,909
like it's bottoming right now. Along on water. Hold on. Good thing I didn't. It's maybe now.

603
01:22:36,149 --> 01:22:49,689
Does this look like a bottom? That's a confirmed bottom. Confirmed bottom. It's coming back. Oh,

604
01:22:49,689 --> 01:23:03,130
fuck. Oh, no. Oh, no. No. How do I send in this shit? Send in the goddamn influencers. I don't

605
01:23:03,130 --> 01:23:10,010
care. If people hate me, I'm fine. Hey, we're good. Everything's fine. Just send in the lobbyists.

606
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:31,180
Yeah, there we go. Water's doing just fine. Oh, discriminating lobbying reports?

607
01:23:35,449 --> 01:23:51,930
Oh, public opinion is concerned. What do I do? What do I do? OK, I'm going to drive by car.

608
01:23:52,649 --> 01:24:16,329
So I can't put these in the condos. All right, I got to be careful. Keep me in mind. Keep in mind.

609
01:24:18,069 --> 01:24:27,689
I have like a $500,000 trade on water that I need to close tomorrow. I'm getting fired for

610
01:24:27,689 --> 01:24:31,130
too much negative public attention to the firm. I got news for you fucking idiots. People hate us

611
01:24:31,130 --> 01:24:37,020
anyways. Areos is just using this to get rid of me because you know what? That's none of your

612
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:41,899
fucking business. When it happens to you, believe me, you'll understand. In the meantime, you can

613
01:24:41,899 --> 01:24:52,300
all get fucked. All right, man. You come out of curling next week? I don't want to find another

614
01:24:52,300 --> 01:25:03,180
partner, man. All right, I got to keep that in mind. Shit starts to seriously hit the fan in

615
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:13,989
Balkador. Social media is going to be a dumpster fire. Can I take these? Can I steal their stuff?

616
01:25:14,789 --> 01:25:36,979
Can I have this? This is mine. I guess I can just take them. All right, whatever.

617
01:25:37,779 --> 01:25:45,739
PR disaster. All right, I got to make public opinion like me tomorrow.

618
01:25:45,739 --> 01:25:57,460
Did you get fired? No, I didn't. Not yet. Steal office supplies. I don't need to steal

619
01:25:57,460 --> 01:26:22,819
office supplies. Make a few TikToks for good PR. We need our apology video. People are being

620
01:26:22,819 --> 01:26:26,180
cold to you. It's probably because you made it past probation and didn't do anything to celebrate.

621
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:30,899
But Corbin never even suggested it. What a stick in the mud. I'm going to tell you

622
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:36,279
more sometime today. The National News Network.

623
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:44,090
Entrances are running high in Balkador as news arrives that a bailout package will not be coming

624
01:26:44,090 --> 01:26:49,449
for the distressed country, leaving many to assume that the worst is yet to come. Huge protests are

625
01:26:49,449 --> 01:26:53,369
anticipated as the people of Balkador understand a deprivation that will surely follow the failure

626
01:26:53,369 --> 01:26:58,649
of the bailout. Rumors are already circulating that northern oil and gas refineries will close

627
01:26:58,649 --> 01:27:04,250
immediately. The lack of a bailout. All but insuring operational. Oh, the bell just rang.

628
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:09,579
Market's open. Everybody run to your desks. I got to go. I have a bunch of trades I have to make.

629
01:27:09,579 --> 01:27:15,239
The news coming up next. I don't know. You're doing good, but you need to start thinking about

630
01:27:15,239 --> 01:27:21,770
international bullshit. Currency values and all that. Pushing things in one state over another,

631
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:26,760
you know. In the end, it's all either worth something on any given day or it isn't, right?

632
01:27:27,399 --> 01:27:31,699
But since we're talking about the fate of nations, they expect us to pretend we care.

633
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:36,579
You can treat countries like anything else, just remember that when they go up or down,

634
01:27:36,579 --> 01:27:40,659
they can take a bunch of other stuff with them. Materials, products, and the rest of it.

635
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:45,340
Try lobbying them if you want to start making waves in several convenient places at once.

636
01:27:45,979 --> 01:27:48,779
Shouldn't be rocket science by now. Later, trader.

637
01:27:51,909 --> 01:27:55,829
As the value of a currency goes up or down, the value of companies which

638
01:27:55,829 --> 01:27:58,310
come from the countries of those regions go up and down as well.

639
01:27:59,270 --> 01:28:01,510
Okay.

640
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:10,439
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, my water. Water. Water going up. New safety standards

641
01:28:10,439 --> 01:28:14,949
for water industry. Means that the numbers are going to go up on your screen.

642
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:24,970
No, no, don't sell. Why would I sell? Water's about to go up. Who owns this company?

643
01:28:25,529 --> 01:28:34,789
Okay. The robo? All right, what we're going to do is we're going to...

644
01:28:35,670 --> 01:28:39,560
Wait, wait, wait. Go back, go back, go back, go back. Where am I? I need to close this trade.

645
01:28:40,199 --> 01:28:45,800
Sell it. No, not yet. Who owns this? Sell, sell, sell, sell. I don't know.

646
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:49,000
I just saw this thing on my screen. I don't know what just happened. FSU.

647
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:54,920
FSU is going to crash. The unit dollar is going down. I don't know what happened.

648
01:28:55,720 --> 01:29:14,680
Make 50... I need to drink tea. Okay. Now I'm going to go back to my desk.

649
01:29:15,479 --> 01:29:24,539
Let me slow this down. Biggest crackdown still coming. Northern coming back.

650
01:29:24,539 --> 01:29:27,739
Behind the scenes, northern executives are furious about the protests.

651
01:29:27,739 --> 01:29:30,460
Government's already making plans to wipe the protesters off the streets and

652
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:32,699
northern has agreed to bring in hundreds of workers from other countries.

653
01:29:33,659 --> 01:29:51,460
Wait, what do you mean? The robo will surge at 1430? Northern coming back.

654
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:53,619
Okay. Northern, oil and gas. Check this shit out.

655
01:29:54,579 --> 01:30:04,949
The robo is tanking. Check this out. We're going to make a ton of money.

656
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:22,920
And enter right now. 13, this shit's coming back. 1430. Hold it. I'm going to get fired.

657
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:38,260
How do I make PR? How do I do PR? I'm just going to wait. Should I jump on board of this?

658
01:30:38,979 --> 01:30:50,359
Stop lobbying. All right. No more lobbying after this. Don't cheat.

659
01:30:50,359 --> 01:30:56,100
I won't lobby anymore. I promise. New safety standards for water.

660
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:03,800
The currency crashed and then I jumped into the company that the currency is based on.

661
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:06,760
And then at 1430, this probably company is going to go up. That's what it said.

662
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:14,680
Starbucks going up. Buy Starnucks before the global collapse.

663
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:39,319
Global collapse? Oh, what time is it? Come on. I'll exit when it's at a thousand.

664
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:45,829
Clickbait? Well, I'll make some money on the clickbait.

665
01:31:46,550 --> 01:31:59,350
Just do badly and the public opinion goes back up. All right. Almost there.

666
01:32:01,909 --> 01:32:13,579
I'm doubling down. Double down. More. Keep it going. I want more.

667
01:32:14,460 --> 01:32:20,699
All right. I'm going to get out of this trade. I'm ready to liquidate this.

668
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:27,750
Water's gone. I can't pay attention to that right now. What's going on?

669
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:34,250
Hey. Excuse me? What just happened? Did we just get hacked?

670
01:32:36,329 --> 01:32:39,770
Stop. Leave me alone. Did everything go dark for a few seconds on your end just now?

671
01:32:39,770 --> 01:32:42,170
It did over here. All right. I got a lot of money in this trade.

672
01:32:43,050 --> 01:32:46,119
I know we have backup generators, so it wasn't the electricity.

673
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:51,460
Oh, well, probably nothing. Okay. Here comes the news.

674
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:58,069
Raggedy unfolds tonight in the democratic public of Balkador.

675
01:32:58,869 --> 01:33:03,479
Really unemployed oil workers took to the streets.

676
01:33:03,479 --> 01:33:06,279
Protests sudden closing of northern oil and gas refineries across the country.

677
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:13,989
Five police cracked down on the protests with brutal efficiency, killing as many

678
01:33:13,989 --> 01:33:17,750
as 50 protesters, including in hundreds of people. Did I do that?

679
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:22,550
Easy balance followed the failure of Northern to secure a bail life from the Balkan government.

680
01:33:26,869 --> 01:33:30,229
A bailout which could have prevented the violence that has at least the moment finally abated.

681
01:33:30,229 --> 01:33:33,350
Oh my god. I sent to the lobbyists to make the cart. What did I do?

682
01:33:34,390 --> 01:33:36,949
Sources tell us that the government and Northern were close to a bailout when

683
01:33:36,949 --> 01:33:39,590
fierce opposition emerged from within the ruling party.

684
01:33:43,850 --> 01:33:47,289
The newly revitalized opposition is claiming that a deal with Northern would have required

685
01:33:47,289 --> 01:33:50,010
unacceptable cuts to vital social programs. What did I do?

686
01:33:52,329 --> 01:33:56,409
Investor confidence in Northern has really barely been lower and will likely continue as the-

687
01:33:58,340 --> 01:34:01,939
Oh, shit. We'll update you with more as the situation-

688
01:34:03,449 --> 01:34:09,770
Get out. Okay. And then we're gonna- we're gonna go short.

689
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:26,170
Um, AK-247. Oh, she got out way too early. Fuck. Dark roasters coffee.

690
01:34:28,890 --> 01:34:32,649
Are your condos worth 50 people, Jerry? God damn it.

691
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,720
I- hold on. I'm gonna be clean from now on.

692
01:34:42,359 --> 01:34:47,560
Ooh, I need to make some more money on this. The FSU.

693
01:34:52,739 --> 01:34:54,579
Okay, let's short the gas.

694
01:34:58,779 --> 01:35:02,300
Jerry? It looks like it's gonna come down. I'm closing 60 minutes.

695
01:35:03,510 --> 01:35:10,170
Coffee is up. Water- who else? Do they have water? It's just the earth drill dark roast coffee.

696
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:17,449
Buy it? I don't- no, I don't think so. I don't think I buy this. I think I short this.

697
01:35:18,170 --> 01:35:22,460
Electronics going up. Who owns that? Is it electronics? It's coal.

698
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:27,750
Where's electronics? Soda? Coffee and plastic.

699
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:30,600
Electronics! The unit dollar's all over the-

700
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,079
B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B...

701
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:39,420
Unit dollar is the, uh, the Bocador currency, isn't it?

702
01:35:40,140 --> 01:35:47,060
Huh? Unit dollar is the- is the currency.

703
01:35:47,619 --> 01:35:54,090
Come on, go down. Go down, go down.

704
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:07,430
Oh, it's the ro- oh, shit. It's the robo.

705
01:36:08,149 --> 01:36:19,380
Public opinion's back, it's okay.

706
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:25,579
Oh god. I was supposed to mention this to you at the time,

707
01:36:25,579 --> 01:36:28,060
but the firm has a tradition that everybody who makes it past probation

708
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:29,739
is supposed to throw a party for everybody.

709
01:36:30,380 --> 01:36:35,850
It isn't mandatory, but some of the brokers here believe that socializing outside of work

710
01:36:35,850 --> 01:36:40,250
will determine how far you can go at the company. I wouldn't overestimate it, I've fired a lot of

711
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:45,319
popular losers. Regardless, you should see an interface in your terminal that will help you

712
01:36:45,319 --> 01:37:04,619
plan it. Okay, organize a party. Party planned in condo. Getting up and just throwing a bust

713
01:37:04,619 --> 01:37:15,420
at the vagasone's head. Oh my god. Jesus. Oh, I lost 50 grand on a unit dollar.

714
01:37:17,319 --> 01:37:25,000
Members of the Ferio staff gather at your apartment for drinks before you head out on

715
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:33,060
the town for your night of bar crawling and whatever else. Several of your co-workers

716
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:37,720
remark on your- it sounds like a kid's birthday party. Several of your co-workers remark on your

717
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:41,159
latest acquisitions, taking care to quickly spin the conversation around a similar or better

718
01:37:41,159 --> 01:37:46,260
things that they've recently purchased themselves. Before everybody heads out,

719
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:52,810
you take one last look around. Satisfied how- that got really quiet. Satisfied how impressed

720
01:37:52,810 --> 01:38:00,460
everybody was. All of this is yours and you earned it. You shut the lights, lock the door,

721
01:38:00,460 --> 01:38:14,939
and the rest of the night becomes a blur. Oh god. Everybody have fun at the party?

722
01:38:15,739 --> 01:38:20,420
Worst part about how many people get fired here is not knowing what you're supposed to do with

723
01:38:20,420 --> 01:38:25,060
them on social media. Should I stay connected with them? It's so awkward. One time one of them even

724
01:38:25,060 --> 01:38:28,819
wrote me and was all like, I think you're so talented, it was so amazing to work with you.

725
01:38:29,699 --> 01:38:34,100
They think I can get them to a job back just because of who my family is? Honestly it's so

726
01:38:34,100 --> 01:38:47,560
rude. I hate it. Take responsibility for your own life. Hello? I thought I told you when you get

727
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:53,289
these challenges you're getting them for a reason. You're intentionally ignoring them because you're

728
01:38:53,289 --> 01:38:57,369
bitter and nobody is filling you in on the strategy. You might be too emotional for this job.

729
01:38:58,329 --> 01:39:02,810
You see me giving a fuck? No you don't. Because I get paid either way and that's all that matters.

730
01:39:03,529 --> 01:39:06,810
And so do you. Just stop fucking around, follow the orders so we can get rich,

731
01:39:06,810 --> 01:39:14,630
get the fuck out of here and never look back. Do you have any idea? What the hell?

732
01:39:17,699 --> 01:39:28,569
Nice streamer setup. You don't need this many monitors. Three. I have four but that's because

733
01:39:28,569 --> 01:39:40,500
I wanted the fourth one. I have an open trade. In what? Oh! Dark roast coffee we need to send

734
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:53,880
the lobbyist in. Send in the lobbyist. I just lost everything. Send in the lobbyist, short it down.

735
01:39:54,680 --> 01:40:01,779
I need coffee to go down. I need coffee to go down. Down, down, down, down, down.

736
01:40:01,779 --> 01:40:07,539
Hurry, hurry, hurry. Come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Go, go, go, go, go,

737
01:40:07,539 --> 01:40:23,699
more! Crush it! You said no more lobbyists. Yeah but I had to. I'm gonna get destroyed.

738
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:36,329
Get munitions price 11% lower? Okay I'm gonna get out of here with a $38,000 loss.

739
01:40:39,189 --> 01:40:50,199
Oh, what do you think? Wait, should I just take the loss? I'm taking the loss, whatever.

740
01:40:50,199 --> 01:41:02,810
I have $620,000, fine. Okay munitions. 11% lower, that's all I had to do. Here it is,

741
01:41:02,810 --> 01:41:08,760
we have coal now, okay. What's this? New carbohydrate research sparks intensified food

742
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:21,060
stuff lobby. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Oil going up. Unexpected demand for oil chokes existing

743
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:29,819
supply raising price too late. I missed plastics. Did I though? What about the, what about the soda

744
01:41:29,819 --> 01:41:38,729
company? FSU going up. The FSU dollar. Soda, soda, soda, soda, soda, soda, soda, soda, soda.

745
01:41:39,369 --> 01:41:49,819
Hold it. Oh my god. Oh my god, the soda and double, I've got double whammy'd here.

746
01:41:50,460 --> 01:41:56,810
I got triple whammy'd here. Soda, soda, soda announces new brand and their currency went up.

747
01:42:02,229 --> 01:42:09,720
I should have went, well I should have went all in. I'm gonna hold this one. Get munitions lower.

748
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:18,729
How am I gonna do that? Although plastics is really killing this. Not yet. Hold on.

749
01:42:23,239 --> 01:42:30,020
And get out now. Okay, what do we got? Munitions have got to go lower. Lobby it down.

750
01:42:30,739 --> 01:42:46,699
Oh then soda, still doing well. Is it still going up? Throughout munitions companies? I,

751
01:42:47,340 --> 01:42:52,460
all right, all right, I'll get, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in. All right, I'm in.

752
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:03,420
Lobby everything. I can't do that. All right, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out. That was a bad trade. I'm out.

753
01:43:04,220 --> 01:43:09,029
Electronics going down. Strong economic performance in Volcador. Dark roast coffee, let's go.

754
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:21,420
I need, now we need a, we need coffee to go up. Come on, give me, give me a coffee right here.

755
01:43:21,420 --> 01:43:39,670
Coffee going up. Munitions have to keep going down. Ken, drop it. 10k on this one right here.

756
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:50,039
Ooh, nice. Munitions is, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, what, what's going on? Munitions,

757
01:43:50,039 --> 01:43:56,279
shortage of munitions. Oh my god, what happened? Did I get it? Did I get in?

758
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:10,979
All right, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out. Okay, I'm good. I have $642,000.

759
01:44:12,020 --> 01:44:19,510
What's coming up next? I feel like I'm watching somebody's job that I don't understand at all.

760
01:44:27,930 --> 01:44:35,380
Get tea? Coal, coal, coal, coal, coal. Who has coal? Who has coal? This drilling company does.

761
01:44:43,399 --> 01:44:48,250
Electronics going down. Coal going up. Plastics going down. Munitions going up.

762
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:58,199
Whoa, what happened? What the fuck just happened? Why'd they do that? Coal's supposed to be going

763
01:44:58,199 --> 01:45:06,899
up. Rising protection has been coal producing. Did this guy just get dumped on? Who dumped that

764
01:45:06,899 --> 01:45:26,390
shit on me? What was that? Read the news? There's an enemy lobbyist. You want to play that game?

765
01:45:26,390 --> 01:45:43,220
Fine. We'll play that game. Bring it back up. Imagine seeing this chart. I feel like what the

766
01:45:43,220 --> 01:46:02,890
fuck is happening? What is happening? Oh no, I didn't sell. What just happened? Emergency PR

767
01:46:03,770 --> 01:46:30,920
minus 25% for a new car. I'll take it. What'd I get? I can sell these? 90? 100? I made money.

768
01:46:32,260 --> 01:46:48,859
Lease your first condo. I think I should probably sell my first condo. Put them in the condo. Okay,

769
01:46:49,819 --> 01:46:54,939
where's the most expensive one? This is a $90,000 car. I'm putting it in this condo.

770
01:46:55,909 --> 01:47:03,899
Holy shit, I can lease this for $14,000 a day? What if I put two cars in here? Oh my god, yeah.

771
01:47:05,420 --> 01:47:29,460
Holy shit. Okay, I'll take it. This is my condo. One day's of cleaning remaining. What's that mean?

772
01:47:30,260 --> 01:47:39,180
Why do I hate chat? I have to close that. What trade do I have open right now? I don't even

773
01:47:39,180 --> 01:47:55,029
remember. Oh, the party. Okay. Oh, all right. I gotta be ready to get the hell out of coal.

774
01:47:58,180 --> 01:48:00,979
Understand that the more you screw up, the more difficult it becomes to make it look like a

775
01:48:00,979 --> 01:48:05,859
misunderstanding. Public opinion is a complex thing. A spectacular amount of time and money

776
01:48:05,859 --> 01:48:11,399
is invested into expressing it within a single metric on your dashboard. We do this so you can

777
01:48:11,399 --> 01:48:15,720
focus on making money. We also do it so you have no excuses whatsoever if you screw up.

778
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:20,840
I guess why I'm standing here. That's right, you screwed it up. If you can't conduct business

779
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:24,840
profitably without dragging Ferrios through the mud, we will find somebody who can. Now get out

780
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:34,979
of here. I think I got my one screw up that I'm allowed, like Super Mario life. Well, somebody

781
01:48:35,859 --> 01:48:41,300
anti-lobbied me. I lobbied and then they lobbied me back. It wasn't... I bought the price. They

782
01:48:41,300 --> 01:48:54,260
lobbied me down, so I lobbied them back. Yeah, I'm thinking about going back to school. I've always

783
01:48:54,260 --> 01:48:58,979
been interested in marine biology or maybe jungle biology. I know it isn't all about cute animals,

784
01:48:58,979 --> 01:49:03,699
but I do love orangutans and their scrunched up little faces. They've hurt the earth so much.

785
01:49:03,699 --> 01:49:07,220
The least we can do is save the animals. Trust me, you don't even want to know how cruel people

786
01:49:07,220 --> 01:49:18,539
can be to them. Makes me sick. I have to get this trade ready to close. I can't talk to anybody

787
01:49:18,539 --> 01:49:23,100
right now. Okay, where am I? Okay, this has to sell immediately when the market opens.

788
01:49:26,039 --> 01:49:49,420
I can't... I just gotta go. Good. Good. Oh, man. Oh, man. Okay. Okay. All right. This is looking good.

789
01:49:52,149 --> 01:50:02,180
Okay. Nice. I'm happy about it. Electronics going up. Close it. Or should we wait for it?

790
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:08,359
We wait for something to do with coal. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Coal's gonna go up.

791
01:50:09,159 --> 01:50:14,199
It's gonna be a big thing with coal. Plastics. Come on. FSU. Come on. FSU is not this one.

792
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:22,180
Why you got... That's me. All right. I'll take the 100 grand. What we got? In one neighborhood,

793
01:50:22,180 --> 01:50:38,890
a coffee com service. I need to speak to coffee. Slow it down. I'm almost at a million dollars.

794
01:50:44,119 --> 01:50:49,079
Lobby more? No, I'm not going to lobby at all today. I need to read this.

795
01:50:51,079 --> 01:50:54,600
So in one neighborhood, a coffee com service is following years of protests over gentrification.

796
01:50:54,600 --> 01:50:57,960
Residents of one small community seem to finally be accepting the presence of Star Nux,

797
01:50:58,680 --> 01:51:02,199
a chain in which they once held solar spots for the end of the beloved local coffee stand. Sam's

798
01:51:02,199 --> 01:51:07,079
coffee meant a lot to us, but I guess they wore us down. Sam died a few years after they drove

799
01:51:07,079 --> 01:51:13,180
him out of the business, too, and he had been the one who was really leading the fight. New

800
01:51:13,180 --> 01:51:18,460
rifle ammo design poised to shake up munitions industry. Deathblossom, a new type of ammunition

801
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:23,420
with the popular RAE-27 semi-automatic rifles renewing the efforts of lobbyists against

802
01:51:23,420 --> 01:51:32,939
the munitions industry, who insist to be taken off store shelves. AK-247 stock surges if free

803
01:51:32,939 --> 01:51:41,079
state citizen stockpile ammunition. Okay. We're going to play the... Oh, never mind. We're not

804
01:51:41,079 --> 01:51:46,489
going to play that today. All right. Let me look at the daily chart. Let's take a look around.

805
01:51:46,489 --> 01:51:58,600
Soda, plastic. FSU is up. Lodging, gas is down. Water is way down. Green grocers are doing a fight.

806
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:08,260
I think I'm going to make a water play here. I think I'm going to go for water.

807
01:52:16,890 --> 01:52:23,619
I would have bought this. I wonder if I should just short this.

808
01:52:27,079 --> 01:52:48,039
FSU dollar is overrated. What? Get a trade in, you fucking idiot. This is coming crashing down.

809
01:52:48,039 --> 01:52:56,539
I didn't even have to lobby. I just waited for the dollar to be bad. Is that bottoming out?

810
01:53:02,630 --> 01:53:21,159
The good thing I got out of coffee. Bottom is zero. Foodstuffs going up. Close this trade.

811
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:33,960
Foodstuffs going up. This is not foodstuffs. Get out. Where's foodstuffs?

812
01:53:39,829 --> 01:53:43,029
You shorted, not longed. That's all right. I got $698,000.

813
01:53:44,229 --> 01:53:49,800
Currencies. How's this doing? All right. Get the Democratic Republic of Baccalaureate price 11%

814
01:53:49,800 --> 01:54:10,979
higher. And then some lobbyists. Let's go in on oil and gas. This is good to me. Here we go. Nice.

815
01:54:11,619 --> 01:54:22,439
I'm not going to use lobbyists. Well, it told me I had to. Stop lobbying. Get the price 11% higher.

816
01:54:22,439 --> 01:54:35,369
I can't do that. I can only do that with a lobbyist. It's almost there. I'm almost done.

817
01:54:35,930 --> 01:54:50,739
Come on. A little more. A little more. Come on. A little more. Have the currency go up a little

818
01:54:50,739 --> 01:55:13,289
higher. Only two more cents. Come on. No. There we go. There it goes. Take up higher. I wonder

819
01:55:13,289 --> 01:55:21,829
if this game is awakening any future traders. The markets are fucking terrifying. Be careful.

820
01:55:22,710 --> 01:55:31,939
Almost there. All right. Sell that. All right. Now I just need the currency to go up a little more.

821
01:55:34,390 --> 01:55:42,899
The FSU is down. Coffee is down. Come on. Come on. I just get a... One more time. That's it. I

822
01:55:42,899 --> 01:56:06,539
promise. All right. Go. I promised. I know I promised, but I promise. Whatever. Invest before

823
01:56:06,539 --> 01:56:12,140
you lobby. Yeah. Otherwise, I'm chasing the price too. All right. Sell it. Okay. All right. I got

824
01:56:12,140 --> 01:56:25,510
$738,000. Munitions going down. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. Keep going. Munitions

825
01:56:25,510 --> 01:56:37,159
down. The FSU up. Oh my God. Get out. Holy shit. Did I get out? Thank God. All right. I probably

826
01:56:37,159 --> 01:56:50,779
just lost the game. All right. What's the play here? I think I'm going to short this at the top

827
01:56:50,779 --> 01:57:00,310
here. Look at how bad this looks. Starnux is up. Green grocery is up. Coffee. Probably maybe coffee.

828
01:57:01,109 --> 01:57:19,659
We know Eats. I don't know what's the play here. What's the play? I mean the top. Pepe left. I mean

829
01:57:20,619 --> 01:57:31,430
this is going down. This is going down. I'm in. A nice pop. This shit's tanking. The FSU is just

830
01:57:31,430 --> 01:57:36,789
the public finance. Financial crisis. The Free State Union casts fear. Lots of fear here. Munitions

831
01:57:36,789 --> 01:57:41,270
are not doing well. Price of munitions drop as production rise. A lot of bullshit going on here.

832
01:57:41,270 --> 01:57:48,789
That was a nice little pop, but it's not going to last. Munitions are dead. The munitions are done.

833
01:57:48,789 --> 01:58:02,859
It's over. Any second now. People seem to be not believing that. People don't really care.

834
01:58:03,500 --> 01:58:22,949
It's losing traction. Drop. Just drop. 32 is the new floor, old man. We'll see. Here we go.

835
01:58:23,510 --> 01:58:33,539
Here it comes. Here comes the really bad news. Bad news incoming. Really bad news coming up.

836
01:58:36,859 --> 01:58:40,220
Yeah, you thought that? That was a bull trap is what we call it here in the office.

837
01:58:40,779 --> 01:58:53,989
This is a bull trap. Watch this. No, yeah. You got nothing. Come on.

838
01:58:53,989 --> 01:59:06,199
Come on. I'm not sending any... And there it is. There's the bull trap. Trap set. There it is.

839
01:59:06,199 --> 01:59:22,409
Goodbye. Told you it was a bull trap. You're finished. Come on. Get this. I don't want likes.

840
01:59:22,409 --> 01:59:26,890
Government of FSU is spending large amounts of money to fuel unrestricted. Yeah, let's go.

841
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:41,369
Yeah, goodbye. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Thank you.

842
01:59:43,050 --> 01:59:53,050
No, no. What is this stock doing? Go down. Go down. I'm not closing this until

843
01:59:53,050 --> 02:00:06,310
below 30. There we go. See? See? It's bottoming out. I don't think so. This has still got a lot

844
02:00:06,310 --> 02:00:23,750
of traction in the news here. Below 30, I'm telling you. This game is bad for chat.

845
02:00:24,550 --> 02:00:28,739
Everyone's getting invested. There we go. All right. Now I'm going to... I'll close it now.

846
02:00:30,579 --> 02:00:40,220
Right now. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Under 30, I told you. All right. Oh, this is not... This

847
02:00:40,220 --> 02:00:48,250
does not look good. Okay. I'm out. I'm out. All right. Now I'm out for real.

848
02:00:49,289 --> 02:00:59,380
I'm out. Now for real. In 10 seconds. Now. Okay. Done. Okay. Good. This game sucks. This

849
02:00:59,380 --> 02:01:03,619
game does not suck. This game is fun. I've been looking for a stock market game like this

850
02:01:05,899 --> 02:01:08,539
six, seven, eight months ago. Remember we talking about wanting a game like this?

851
02:01:09,260 --> 02:01:22,300
Oh, I wanted it so bad. Okay. All right. I'm going to... Let's go get... Markets are closing

852
02:01:22,300 --> 02:01:43,899
anyways. I did it good for the day. Speed this back up. This game is slot machines with graphs.

853
02:01:44,779 --> 02:02:09,399
I mean, that's just the stock market. You just described the stock market. The stock market is

854
02:02:09,399 --> 02:02:16,520
just a shitload of people, like 50 people all hovering around the roulette table, all screaming

855
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:21,079
the numbers that they're playing and arguing with each other as to why you should play certain

856
02:02:21,079 --> 02:02:29,779
numbers. It's just roulette table with like 100 people at the table. All right. Fire. I won.

857
02:02:30,420 --> 02:02:43,350
Another person down. No evidence was disclosed today. I didn't lobby that much. Get some cash

858
02:02:43,350 --> 02:02:54,140
here. Holy shit. Should I get another condo? Should I get maybe another car? Should I buy

859
02:02:54,140 --> 02:03:10,020
another one? Words on the screen make no sense to me. It makes sense. Hey, they make sense to me.

860
02:03:10,899 --> 02:03:27,079
I know what I'm doing. I organize a condo party. No, I'm good for the day. After these condos,

861
02:03:27,079 --> 02:03:37,369
I don't even have furniture. Peter Griffin trading stocks. Put stuff in the condo. Yeah. You

862
02:03:37,369 --> 02:03:46,439
know what? I can't. They're already there. I have to buy stuff. It's $80,000 to buy furniture. I

863
02:03:46,439 --> 02:04:12,739
can't. How do I leave? I don't leave? Oh, I didn't click go home. Oh, okay. I like this game. This

864
02:04:12,739 --> 02:04:22,779
game is good. This is fun. I like this. Oh, I don't need this shit right now. You can't be really

865
02:04:22,779 --> 02:04:29,579
serious about Furious letting me go. Because everybody I beat was some nobody's shit face

866
02:04:29,579 --> 02:04:34,060
analyst. I've been working for years. I've been loyal to you for years. Please leave the building

867
02:04:34,060 --> 02:04:40,699
calmly. I'll have security meet you on the ground floor. Congratulations on your promotion to

868
02:04:40,699 --> 02:04:47,779
associate. I might say that you've made it through your real probation period. The vast majority of

869
02:04:47,779 --> 02:04:52,859
our analysts never make it as far as you have. You need to prove yourself and we may promote you to

870
02:04:52,859 --> 02:04:56,460
vice president. At that point, you'll get a taste of what it really means to be part of a firm like

871
02:04:56,460 --> 02:05:12,060
Furious. Vice president. Vice president. Holy shit. I've been here for five days. That's a psycho.

872
02:05:16,470 --> 02:05:26,630
Whoa, that was weird. I think is the game saving? Hopefully the game has been saving.

873
02:05:32,250 --> 02:05:40,729
Law and disorder. This is insane, Lois. Yeah, it reminds me of the time I sent GME to the moon.

874
02:05:44,659 --> 02:05:49,109
Where do you think you're going? What are you even doing here? We're executing a search warrant.

875
02:05:49,109 --> 02:05:52,869
Knowing what you know, I'm sure you can expect charges to follow shortly. What?

876
02:05:53,909 --> 02:05:56,949
Oh, I don't even think about going anywhere else. The passports of every employee of this

877
02:05:56,949 --> 02:06:09,100
firm have been flagged. Get lost. What are you talking about? Hey, don't touch my computer.

878
02:06:09,899 --> 02:06:42,779
What the hell? The firm is going to prison. This is scripted. Welcome to the show. Good morning.

879
02:06:42,779 --> 02:06:47,180
I'm glad we're all able to take a bit of time off even if it was unexpected. Did you meet Walker yet?

880
02:06:47,180 --> 02:06:51,659
I hear she's your new rival. Ignore her if she starts talking nonsense. She's not an intellectual.

881
02:06:51,659 --> 02:06:56,619
She's hallucinating. They tried to ban hard drugs here for a while to keep the coke under control.

882
02:06:57,260 --> 02:07:01,739
Who knew we would end up with a person on some kind of experimental LSD meth ketamine combo instead?

883
02:07:02,539 --> 02:07:06,220
I don't care how good it makes her at math or computers or whatever. Between you and me,

884
02:07:06,220 --> 02:07:15,899
not worth it. They're a psycho and not the cool kind. Do you play anything else besides solitaire?

885
02:07:15,899 --> 02:07:21,819
Holy shit, that's so boring. If you think you've got any chance at getting that VP position over me,

886
02:07:21,819 --> 02:07:25,500
you're even crazier than I am. Understand something? I don't sleep, I don't eat and

887
02:07:25,500 --> 02:07:30,939
drink intravenously. I live in the algorithm. I see the constellations, the data of everything

888
02:07:30,939 --> 02:07:35,260
everywhere. I'm ready for the future. You don't even have one. Now get out of my fucking face.

889
02:07:39,720 --> 02:07:46,699
All right, the trading is on. Let's go. Violence continues to spread across the

890
02:07:46,699 --> 02:07:50,060
Democratic Republic of Balkador with many saying that the country is now on the brink of full-scale

891
02:07:50,060 --> 02:07:58,409
civil war. Really? Well, government representatives deny that foodstuffs, foodstuffs, foodstuffs, and

892
02:07:58,409 --> 02:08:02,569
livestock, and foodstuffs, and livestock. Where is it? Foodstuffs, and livestock, and

893
02:08:02,569 --> 02:08:07,050
livestock, and foodstuffs. Where is it? I don't know where it is. I'm so late to this trade.

894
02:08:07,930 --> 02:08:19,720
Uno eats infinity mart. Holy shit, this is expensive. I missed it. The euro. Chaos in

895
02:08:19,720 --> 02:08:36,649
the market. I need to drink fucking tea. God damn it. Slow it down. Let's go. Ammunition.

896
02:08:37,289 --> 02:08:48,300
Weapons will surge this afternoon. Yeah, I know. I need weapons, products, weapons.

897
02:08:49,670 --> 02:09:03,399
Missiles. We're going big on missiles. Arms dealing. No, I'm buying weapons. Buy, then sell,

898
02:09:03,399 --> 02:09:12,439
then buy again. God damn it. Leave me alone. We need you to start taking long-term positions

899
02:09:12,439 --> 02:09:17,979
in some of the companies the firm is dealing with. I've unlocked the ability for your terminal to

900
02:09:17,979 --> 02:09:22,789
start collecting dividends. Dividends, you will generate ongoing revenue from the stock of any

901
02:09:22,789 --> 02:09:29,880
company you've bought on a regular basis. It's our piece of their profit, so make sure you pick

902
02:09:29,880 --> 02:09:34,739
companies that are making one. Dividends can be far more lucrative over time than constantly

903
02:09:34,739 --> 02:09:39,850
trying to guess which way the market is going. Especially if you have confidence that a company,

904
02:09:39,850 --> 02:09:44,090
a weapons manufacturer, for example, is going to continue to grow and do well because of some kind

905
02:09:44,090 --> 02:09:48,489
of event. You're in the big leagues now. If you stubbornly hold onto the wrong company for a long

906
02:09:48,489 --> 02:09:57,609
time, the results can be catastrophic. Weigh your options carefully. Buy. Missile Tech AG. Sign the

907
02:09:57,609 --> 02:10:02,329
dividend agreement. The position will earn expected dividends at market closure every day, but cannot

908
02:10:02,329 --> 02:10:11,380
be liquidated until you pay the penalty fee. Well, that's $700,000 and that's all my money.

909
02:10:11,939 --> 02:10:25,319
I don't have any money. All right, missiles are going up. Buy. Wait. How many do I have?

910
02:10:25,319 --> 02:10:42,890
$710,000? How do I have $970,000 here? I have $1.46 million in that. Oh my goodness gracious.

911
02:10:45,109 --> 02:11:01,159
I've signed the dividend agreement. Every single cent I own is in this. Okay, this afternoon it's

912
02:11:01,159 --> 02:11:09,989
going to pop. Here it goes. Oh my God. What should I do? I have $1.7 million. What should I do?

913
02:11:10,789 --> 02:11:20,729
This is huge. Did I pay the penalty to take millions of dollars? Hold it. Should I hold it?

914
02:11:22,170 --> 02:11:37,340
This is $1.9 million. Lobby it now? Oh my God. I can't. I have just weapons. All right. I did

915
02:11:37,340 --> 02:11:41,100
it. I did it. Now I'm going to liquidate it. I'm going to take $2.3 million. Oh my God. This is a

916
02:11:41,100 --> 02:12:01,989
big mistake. This is a mistake. $2 million. $2.1 million. Euric dominion? The euro's overvalued.

917
02:12:01,989 --> 02:12:09,319
Is this euro? No. Should I hold it? Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Is this civil war happening?

918
02:12:09,319 --> 02:12:18,439
Yeah, but this is $2.5 million. You won't get the dividend if you sell it. Oh man.

919
02:12:22,359 --> 02:12:26,939
Weapons are surging. Hold for the dividend. Hold for the dividend.

920
02:12:31,930 --> 02:12:34,489
It's going to come down though. All right. I'm going to pretend it doesn't exist.

921
02:12:37,750 --> 02:12:49,189
You need to have diamond hands. Countries of Sienna. Sienna is this company. Sienna's not

922
02:12:49,189 --> 02:13:08,390
doing well at all. Sell now. Jesus. Should I? I missed the dividend. This is $100,000 in dividend.

923
02:13:15,479 --> 02:13:26,420
Plastics going. No. It's okay. It's $2.2 million still. It's all right. I have to hold this to the

924
02:13:26,420 --> 02:13:38,970
end of the day. Okay. Now I'm going to... What the fuck just happened? Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

925
02:13:38,970 --> 02:13:48,920
What do you mean weapons down? Regulation of the weapons industry is ongoing. Get out. $2.1 million.

926
02:13:51,609 --> 02:14:02,500
Sell. Sell. Sell. I have $1.8 million. I'm good. I thought I sold it. I thought I sold it. No. I

927
02:14:02,500 --> 02:14:10,920
got out of the dividend agreement. Okay. Get back in. I have $1.8 million. All right. Let me...

928
02:14:10,920 --> 02:14:24,890
I'm going to get back in. You sold the bottom. I did, didn't I? All right. $500,000. Lock that up

929
02:14:24,890 --> 02:14:40,420
as a dividend. Sign the dividend agreement. I have $1.3 million now to play with. Southern soda.

930
02:14:41,579 --> 02:14:53,420
Long. Southern soda smells like blood. Wait. Why is that a good thing? I just bought on the news.

931
02:14:53,420 --> 02:15:12,390
What? Why is that a good thing? It smells like blood. Southern soda. Beverages are up too.

932
02:15:12,390 --> 02:15:19,210
Look at this. This is going to be good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I got my dividends coming in.

933
02:15:19,850 --> 02:15:33,579
Who the heck likes on the news about how real it is? I mean, that's like... That looks pretty...

934
02:15:34,300 --> 02:15:37,979
That smell is more than money. It's blood. Buy southern soda with everything you got. Why?

935
02:15:39,020 --> 02:15:49,100
Why would you want to have something smell like blood? I'm thinking of closing this.

936
02:15:53,189 --> 02:15:59,590
Do you guys remember that time when Chuck E. Cheese came to the stream

937
02:16:01,130 --> 02:16:07,619
and when I showed the me kissing Chuck E. Cheese picture, this stock price went down by like 5%

938
02:16:07,619 --> 02:16:23,189
or something? Didn't that actually happen? That's so stupid. I don't think it was related at all,

939
02:16:23,189 --> 02:16:26,390
but somebody brought it up. They were like, hey dude, I like did some math and I did a little

940
02:16:26,390 --> 02:16:31,270
thing. I kind of did some timing here. This is when he appeared on your stream and this is

941
02:16:31,270 --> 02:16:39,260
what their stock value was. And this is when you showed the kiss. It's like, no, that's not accurate.

942
02:16:39,260 --> 02:16:46,969
That's just nothing. That doesn't mean anything. I'm out. That was good trade. 1.4 million. What do

943
02:16:46,969 --> 02:16:56,329
I got here? How is it? How's the missiles doing? What do you have weapons? All right. Missiles.

944
02:17:00,149 --> 02:17:11,450
I have to hold it for the dividend. What's going on with Starnox? Plastic going up.

945
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:16,040
I only got like a few more minutes in the trading day. All right. So what I'm going to do is I'm

946
02:17:16,040 --> 02:17:22,120
going to... Let's go all in. Let's go all in. I'm going to... I'm going to make that even up. You

947
02:17:22,120 --> 02:17:31,500
know what? Market's closed. I'm going to get my dividend. This guy's negative 18,000. He

948
02:17:31,500 --> 02:17:51,930
fucked up big time. It's okay. I got 200 grand. Should I buy some more cars? Sell for $187,000?

949
02:17:56,309 --> 02:18:12,459
I think I'm just going to do that. That's 200 grand. I can buy a house now. Buy a house. Market

950
02:18:12,459 --> 02:18:19,559
value. Decoration slots. Oh my goodness. Okay. Hold on a minute. I'm going to... This is going

951
02:18:19,559 --> 02:18:26,809
to make me a shitload of money. I'm going to sell this house for $83,000 and then I'm going to buy

952
02:18:26,809 --> 02:18:49,190
some cars. Oh yeah. Come on. I'll check this shit out. $28,000 a day. $34,000 a day. $37,000 a day

953
02:18:49,190 --> 02:18:57,190
from this house. This is currently... But who's even taking this? All right. I'm going to sell

954
02:18:57,190 --> 02:19:04,940
this one. Don't need to... We're buying houses now. I need to buy paintings. Oh, I need a million

955
02:19:04,940 --> 02:19:13,379
dollars. Now lease the house. Not yet. Not yet. Hold on. Because I need more decorations and shit.

956
02:19:13,379 --> 02:19:21,190
Designer chair. I'm going to buy... Okay. Here's what I'm going to do. Ready? Check this out.

957
02:19:21,909 --> 02:19:34,840
I'm selling this. I am now going to buy a furniture loot box. Okay. Sofa. Going in the house.

$38,000 a day. Designer chair. $38,000. A bear statue. Lease it for almost $39,000 a day.

959
02:19:43,940 --> 02:19:49,940
I just spent a bunch of money. That's okay. This is where I live. I live here.

960
02:19:50,659 --> 02:19:54,870
Wait. Do I even have a house? Wait. I don't have a house.

961
02:19:57,399 --> 02:20:10,139
Shit. What do I do? I need to live somewhere. I sold my house? I have to live at work now?

962
02:20:10,780 --> 02:20:28,180
Buy another condo. I need to live here. Buy another condo. Okay. This is where I live.

963
02:20:28,739 --> 02:20:39,530
I got fired. I'm not going to be getting fired for organizing a union when I explicitly said

964
02:20:39,530 --> 02:20:44,170
that it was not what I was doing. All I want to do is make all of you think of yourselves

965
02:20:44,170 --> 02:20:47,290
as important stakeholders in the business of people who get paid to show up here.

966
02:20:48,010 --> 02:20:51,049
If all of us felt that way, imagine the things we could accomplish and the profits we might be

967
02:20:51,049 --> 02:20:56,659
entitled to. Far more profits than anyone in any kind of failed communist state would know

968
02:20:56,659 --> 02:21:00,899
anything about. I know that much. Sadly, you're all too foolish to see. You don't deserve me.

969
02:21:00,899 --> 02:21:13,290
Nobody deserves me. Fuck you. Fuck you all. How many people work here still? Okay. It's just me

970
02:21:13,850 --> 02:21:20,889
and the human computer. How did you do today? Leave me alone. Working shitty uppers. Fuck.

971
02:21:22,020 --> 02:21:27,459
I want to know what you did today. Ten million in your account. Down one million.

972
02:21:29,610 --> 02:21:40,120
Down $275,000 today. I wonder who's going to get the promotion to VP. Unionize your

973
02:21:40,120 --> 02:21:44,440
workplace just gave ten community subs. I bet you're wondering how it could be that this

974
02:21:44,440 --> 02:21:50,139
place was drowning in TIC agents two days ago. And yet now everything is back to being exactly

975
02:21:50,139 --> 02:21:54,709
the way it was. On top of that, dead silence from everyone. Not as much as a word about it.

976
02:21:55,350 --> 02:21:59,270
I see everybody playing it smart. Silence is golden, they figure. Hey, if everything's fine,

977
02:21:59,270 --> 02:22:03,510
I don't need to know anything. You don't need to worry either. Just say the interests of our

978
02:22:03,510 --> 02:22:07,989
government and Farios are overlapping at the moment and not only the way they usually do.

979
02:22:08,709 --> 02:22:12,629
For some of the people with access to Geissnet and put two and two together, but they should

980
02:22:12,629 --> 02:22:20,940
know better than anyone to not say a word. Or you do too. Also, I missed ten community subs from

981
02:22:21,020 --> 02:22:30,540
Onomos and Lenny the Person. Thanks both of you for your ten subs. Wait, aren't these everyone

982
02:22:30,540 --> 02:22:39,690
that got fired? Resent them for trying to make everybody else look bad by doing it.

983
02:22:39,690 --> 02:22:43,209
Before long, you realize it makes sense, especially the cleaners who tried to make it feel like it was

984
02:22:43,209 --> 02:22:48,409
all a dream. It also seems to be easy to impress everybody as a host when you've got a staff at

985
02:22:48,409 --> 02:22:53,049
your beck and call. The bartenders and waiters go out of their way to make it clear that this is your

986
02:22:53,049 --> 02:22:58,010
party in a way that makes you understand they've done this many times before. Everybody loves you

987
02:22:58,010 --> 02:23:02,250
and tells you this is the best party they've ever been to. Before long, everybody will be doing this

988
02:23:02,889 --> 02:23:19,319
and try to enjoy it. Blackout. You look so tensed lately, maybe you should take some time off.

989
02:23:19,959 --> 02:23:24,200
I always like to say, spoiler yourself, you deserve it. Taking a two-year backpacking

990
02:23:24,200 --> 02:23:28,440
sabbatical after college was the best thing I ever did. I learned so much about the world

991
02:23:28,440 --> 02:23:32,040
just by going to places and really letting myself be there. Come by sometime and I'll

992
02:23:32,040 --> 02:23:41,059
show you the pictures. I know how boring it can seem, but dividends work. It can't be rip and

993
02:23:41,059 --> 02:23:45,940
run, buy, and sell bullshit all the time. It makes sense now and then to check in for the long haul

994
02:23:45,940 --> 02:23:50,500
when you're dealing with things that will never change. Yesterday you fucked up. You should have

995
02:23:50,500 --> 02:23:55,299
taken the dividends and respected the play. You're watching the news right? I'm sure you can figure

996
02:23:55,299 --> 02:23:59,059
out that this is bigger than either of us now. When you eat shit like this you make it seem like

997
02:23:59,059 --> 02:24:04,659
you can't see the bigger picture. Start seeing it. What's wrong with this person? Like how about like

998
02:24:04,659 --> 02:24:09,059
I do make my own trades and you like look I want if I want to buy like star nucks I'm just gonna

999
02:24:09,059 --> 02:24:23,430
buy it like what the who cares leave me alone tea drink tea save civil war on the democratic

1000
02:24:23,430 --> 02:24:28,229
republic of balkadar has now been declared with leaders in the free state union the europe dominion

1001
02:24:28,229 --> 02:24:33,350
and other global powers calling for peace of course on the ground so just that sudden escalation of

1002
02:24:33,350 --> 02:24:36,469
hostilities have been tied to poorly trained rebel troops getting access to increasingly heavy

1003
02:24:36,469 --> 02:24:48,809
weaponry 23 people attended the party in your condo what what i get long i'm long on this one

1053
02:34:33,989 --> 02:34:45,510
hey good trades trade team good trades all around you gained more from a landlord than you did from

1054
02:34:45,510 --> 02:34:52,860
work i did well it's because there's like three sports cars in the driveway you're not even

1055
02:34:52,860 --> 02:35:09,879
renting the house at that point you're renting the cars looks like first having some trouble with

1056
02:35:09,879 --> 02:35:15,079
cyber security what he called us to investigate but a hack that massive attracts attention regardless

1057
02:35:16,040 --> 02:35:19,239
seems like your people are getting it under control but i'm sure it makes you think about things

1058
02:35:20,120 --> 02:35:24,760
a bunch of teenagers in the middle of nowhere can hit ferrios like this if you're not as untouchable

1059
02:35:24,760 --> 02:35:29,799
as you think you are and i'm letting everybody know they can reach out to the trade and investment

1060
02:35:29,799 --> 02:35:34,520
commission anytime they like we're always looking for people who are as good at predicting their own

1061
02:35:34,520 --> 02:35:46,600
futures as they are predicting the markets so you're wrong i want to be a plant informant i don't

1062
02:35:46,600 --> 02:35:50,360
look sad today but don't worry i'm through the worst of it i was just thinking about how much

1063
02:35:50,360 --> 02:35:54,040
suffering there is in the world like have you heard about all the sad stuff going on in the

1064
02:35:54,040 --> 02:35:59,239
balkador it's so sad why does one tiny little group of sad poor people have to go through every

1065
02:35:59,239 --> 02:36:03,000
bad thing that could possibly happen i'm just thankful that so many people from places like

1066
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:07,959
here are trying to like set up businesses there so they can have better jobs i read a quote once

1067
02:36:07,959 --> 02:36:13,340
about how people will forget what you do but remember how you made them feel well hopefully

1068
02:36:13,340 --> 02:36:23,129
they feel better soon yeah that's that's a good yeah that's true me too i hope they do i hope they

1069
02:36:23,129 --> 02:36:46,739
do better i'm stuff so all of my screen employee business was that he was that my phone whose phone

1070
02:36:46,739 --> 02:36:57,049
is that what's wrong what's going on my thing another thing i forgot to say can you believe

1071
02:36:57,049 --> 02:37:02,250
how bad we got hacked the whole system's all messed up just saying they got deep into the database or

1072
02:37:02,250 --> 02:37:07,030
something apparently things would be screwed up like this for days i'll mention this but some

1073
02:37:07,030 --> 02:37:11,510
junior analyst asked corbin about it and he fired them on the spot this is the most emotional i've

1074
02:37:11,510 --> 02:37:15,350
ever seen him you see him just pretend like everything's fine and that none of this terrible

1075
02:37:15,350 --> 02:37:18,549
shit's even happening to us it's seriously like the worst thing that's ever happened in my life

1076
02:37:19,829 --> 02:37:24,069

than you in prison for the rest of your life there are people who deserve to go down even

1266
03:09:23,979 --> 03:09:30,500
more than you do and you know exactly who i'm talking about millers the family office the names

1267
03:09:30,500 --> 03:09:35,850

03:09:35,850 --> 03:09:40,760
like that and you're already off to a good start you can walk out of here today and go back to

1269
03:09:40,760 --> 03:09:46,040
ferrios like none of this ever happened the state will fake your trial i'll do my best to get the

1270
03:09:46,040 --> 03:09:50,360
agency to deal with your fine and you become a confidential informant to the trade and investment

1271
03:09:51,319 --> 03:09:55,909
this is not a negotiation you can help us take them down or you can take the fall yourself

1272
03:09:55,909 --> 03:10:13,659
what will it be is this a test yeah what what if this is a paid actor from the company it's

1273
03:10:13,659 --> 03:10:20,149
very possible this could be a paid actor and this is a test that guy seems pretty eccentric

1274
03:10:20,149 --> 03:10:35,979
and weird doesn't he no deal snitches this is a test you know yeah that means this is a test

1275
03:10:36,780 --> 03:10:49,239
you can trust him he has a fat ass do you want to i don't know i feel like this is like uh i feel

1276
03:10:49,239 --> 03:10:59,579
like this is a trick somehow i'm gonna say no i understand you think the family can save you

1277
03:10:59,579 --> 03:11:03,819
from all this and even the government trying to take you out ultimately work for them too

1278
03:11:03,819 --> 03:11:10,600
just like anyone but ask yourself this if they're really all so so powerful do you think they'll

1279
03:11:10,600 --> 03:11:14,200
give a second thought to sacrificing you the moment that you become an inconvenience

1280
03:11:15,079 --> 03:11:20,870
do you think they got to where they are by rewarding loyalty even when it hurts well i

1281
03:11:20,870 --> 03:11:31,139
guess it's all rhetorical at this point i guess you're going to find out i made so much money

1282
03:11:31,139 --> 03:11:36,340
for you i made so much money before court resumes i would like to apologize to the jury for the

1283
03:11:36,340 --> 03:11:42,260
substantial delays involved in this case numerous motions filed by council on both sides have

1284
03:11:42,260 --> 03:11:47,780
created unnecessary hindrances and this court has already had to give several citations for contempt

1285
03:11:47,780 --> 03:11:53,620
let me be clear any further attempts to administratively obstruct justice in

1286
03:11:53,620 --> 03:12:01,530
these proceedings will result in prison and disbarment have i understood yes your honor

1287
03:12:01,530 --> 03:12:07,129
yes your honor good because of the media attention surrounding these events it has been necessary to

1288
03:12:07,129 --> 03:12:13,450
sequester our new jury for several months however we are now prepared to proceed the prosecution

1289
03:12:13,450 --> 03:12:20,309
has called the vice president of ferrios capital management to testify average head phd just gave

1290

a lot of money thank you your honor community subs as the defendant you've been called to testify

1292
03:12:37,350 --> 03:12:41,430
a result of the overwhelming evidence against you over the past several months you've made

1293
03:12:41,430 --> 03:12:47,559
substantial use of a dark web communication tool known as geiss net isn't where i do like the like

1294
03:12:47,559 --> 03:12:54,920
move my arms around like put my eyes rolling back my head i don't know what what is that for

1295
03:12:54,920 --> 03:12:58,040
this tool you were able to gain access to privileged information that enabled you to

1296
03:12:58,040 --> 03:13:01,399
act on a legal foreknowledge of the movement of several markets do you admit to it

1297
03:13:04,379 --> 03:13:07,979
your honor that sounds like a mega man that sounds like a map in mega man

1298
03:13:12,280 --> 03:13:18,379
this tool you're able to gain access privileged information that you know

1299
03:13:18,379 --> 03:13:26,180
no of course i don't admit it no i mean i mean maybe once i saw i looked over the shoulder of

1300
03:13:26,180 --> 03:13:31,579
somebody that was doing it no i have no idea what you're talking about because of a use of

1301
03:13:31,579 --> 03:13:38,409
insider information fair competition in the coffee market was destabilized do you understand

1302
03:13:38,409 --> 03:13:47,989
you were responsible for this air competition in the coffee market i was not responsible for

1303
03:13:47,989 --> 03:13:55,690
this what are you talking about you callously reaped tremendous profits from the crash of the

1304
03:13:55,690 --> 03:14:00,280
global gas and electric market a crash that left thousands of people in developing countries that

1305
03:14:00,280 --> 03:14:07,989
produced it unable to care for their families do you deny this i know i didn't do this wait no wait

1306
03:14:07,989 --> 03:14:17,959
i don't want to answer this wrong do you deny this i invoke my right to not respond on the

1307
03:14:17,959 --> 03:14:22,629
advice of counsel that i may incriminate myself but that means that means i did it i deny this

1308
03:14:22,629 --> 03:14:31,129
yes leading the fifth just means yes i did it in a different sentence most significantly the cascade

1309
03:14:31,129 --> 03:14:34,889
of all these actions resulted in nothing less than a civil war within the democratic republic

1310
03:14:34,889 --> 03:14:42,950
of balcador do you realize that you did this for your own personal gain is this the part of the

1311
03:14:42,950 --> 03:14:50,469
movie where i go yes yes it was yeah and i felt like my head starts spinning around i did it

1312
03:14:50,549 --> 03:14:55,350
and i could have gotten away with it too but this little legal council had and i have a

1313
03:14:55,350 --> 03:15:03,239
fucking big black cape on like a big top hat like no i'm gonna deny it you did you really do you

1314
03:15:03,239 --> 03:15:11,420
realize that you did all this for your own personal gain and nothing else no objection your honor none

1315
03:15:11,420 --> 03:15:15,899
of us are here to moralize on the social outcome of a free market these events could have taken

1316
03:15:15,899 --> 03:15:21,110
place regardless of whether or not they invested on behalf of the firm as they did the objection is

1317
03:15:21,110 --> 03:15:25,829
sustained council will limit themselves to matters concerning the specific little realities which

1318
03:15:25,829 --> 03:15:31,420
occurred with pleasure your honor as i mentioned we have overwhelming evidence of insider trading

1319
03:15:31,420 --> 03:15:36,219
through geist net i mentioned the implications only to demonstrate a complete lack of remorse

1320
03:15:36,219 --> 03:15:41,500
on the part of the defendant objection the evidence proves nothing about their state of mind

1321
03:15:41,500 --> 03:15:46,340
his employee was offered the opportunity to cooperate with the government to make amends

1322
03:15:46,340 --> 03:15:51,239
for their crimes and refused this person is a financial professional performing a task on

1323
03:15:51,239 --> 03:15:55,719
behalf of an employer no more responsible or directly connected to the state of the world

1324
03:15:55,719 --> 03:16:02,040
than the rest of us enough i will not have this trial devolve into the kind of circus that led

1325
03:16:02,040 --> 03:16:07,879
up to it again this court will limit itself to the rule of law the impact can be considered if and

1326
03:16:07,879 --> 03:16:19,430
when the client has been found guilty well they won't be the verdict you've been found guilty

1327
03:16:22,729 --> 03:16:28,010
of all charges please know that the jury wait did he just turn and say that to me please know

1328
03:16:28,010 --> 03:16:34,899
that the jury required 15 minutes to reach this verdict however given the scope of restitution

1329
03:16:34,899 --> 03:16:38,579
that could be made this court is determined you will be punished via financial penalty rather

1330
03:16:38,579 --> 03:16:45,049
than incarceration i hereby impose a fine of one million dollars payable immediately

1331
03:16:46,739 --> 03:16:53,350
holy shit that's awesome i have 10 million dollars in the bank your honor i wish to have it noted

1332
03:16:53,350 --> 03:16:57,750
that a penalty of this amount implies the expectation that ferrios will accept liability

1333
03:16:57,829 --> 03:17:05,340
on behalf of the employee and due to substantial liquidity problems at the moment i'm afraid that

1334
03:17:05,340 --> 03:17:09,020
ferrios will not be able to undertake this responsibility the employee will be forced

1335
03:17:09,020 --> 03:17:18,860
to pay the full amount from their personal account is that is that it can i go can i get back to the

1336
03:17:18,860 --> 03:17:24,200
desk your honor according to our evidence the defendant is perfectly capable of making this

1337
03:17:24,200 --> 03:17:29,079
payment from their personal account but your honor think of how little this will leave them

1338
03:17:29,079 --> 03:17:34,469
to begin the long and hard process of rehabilitating their character unfortunately it seems that a

1339
03:17:34,469 --> 03:17:39,430
substantial portion of the funds are overseas held in shell companies are otherwise difficult

1340
03:17:39,430 --> 03:17:46,469
to access fine i will put the matter to the defendant directly are you prepared to cooperate

1341
03:17:46,469 --> 03:17:56,139
with this court to retrieve the payment required i would say no nope i am not i am not prepared

1342
03:17:57,479 --> 03:18:03,370
yes take the take the million the matter is settled then the client will pay the amount

1343
03:18:03,370 --> 03:18:14,020
ordered and be released presently this court is dismissed i'm good i have like 4.8 million dollars

1344
03:18:14,020 --> 03:18:22,459
in my account you're still a millionaire they cracked you good huh you just lost more money

1345
03:18:22,459 --> 03:18:26,540
than most people will ever imagine well you know what they say easy come easy go with everything

1346
03:18:26,540 --> 03:18:30,860

1355
03:19:31,610 --> 03:19:35,989
right thing the amount of scrutiny that ferrios is presently under we are unable to render any

1356
03:19:35,989 --> 03:19:41,030
kind of payment which might be misinterpreted as compensating you for paying the fine however

1357
03:19:41,030 --> 03:19:44,950
please know that your loyalty and discretion in this matter has not gone unnoticed or unappreciated

1358
03:19:46,229 --> 03:19:50,229
when time is right you'll be rewarded handsomely for what you've done on a completely unrelated

1359
03:19:50,229 --> 03:19:54,069
unrelated note please send me a list of jurisdictions outside of the free state of

1360
03:19:54,069 --> 03:19:58,629
york dominion where you think you might enjoy permanent residency most of them really aren't

1361
03:19:58,629 --> 03:20:04,469
that bad not if you have the requisite amount of armed security servants and whatnot if you think

1362
03:20:04,469 --> 03:20:08,309
about it things here will probably be equally bad before too much longer and they've got better

1363
03:20:08,309 --> 03:20:25,510
beaches anyways give it some thought goodbye back in that fucking office i look sad today but don't

1364
03:20:25,510 --> 03:20:28,950
worry i'm through the worst of it i'm just thinking about how much suffering there is in the world
