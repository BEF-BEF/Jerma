1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:14,019
Hey, howdy doody. Oh, how diddley do neighbor, right? What's that guy's name? Flanders.

2
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:26,570
We're gonna play more Blitz The League 2 today, because I think it's a great game. It's a lot

3
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:37,320
of fun. Can I build another birdhouse? I think one is enough. I think one birdhouse is a pretty

4
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:47,450
good quota for 10 years. Last time I built a birdhouse, I was probably... I would say every

5
00:00:47,450 --> 00:01:04,599
time I get a tetanus shot is when a birdhouse should be built. So, you know, go get a tetanus

6
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:12,870
shot. Now, you know what? I actually think I probably do for one. Oh my... what's going on

7
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:17,819
with this? What's going on with the sub notifications? Oh wait, I heard about this. I heard about

8
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:23,700
this. Yeah, I might have to do... I might have to turn off stream labs. I heard that it's

9
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:45,879
like broken, right? The stream labs. It's intended. Oh, oh my god. Okay, well,

10
00:01:47,000 --> 00:02:01,980
that's like... that's more resubs than chat. Welcome to the stream. But yeah, we're gonna

11
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:06,280
play more Blitz The League. And I have something very unfortunate to tell you guys.

12
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,389
I know you guys aren't... no one's gonna want to hear this, but I have to say it.

13
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:20,300
Unfortunately, this is one of those weeks where I have a lot of shit to do. The last couple days,

14
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:27,509
I've been doing things. I've been taking care of some stuff. And I gotta do my taxes.

15
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:37,669
I gotta get it done. So, this is pretty much the only stream until like probably Friday or

16
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:44,419
Saturday. Because I gotta get that shit taken care of. So, this is like the week that was

17
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:54,360
gonna be kind of hard for me to stream that much. So, we'll go for... I'm gonna try to go

18
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:02,740
as long as I can tonight. Just commit tax fraud. No, I gotta make sure I get it right. Every

19
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:09,289
year I take at least a day or two. And it happened to fall. I talked to my CPA and there's

20
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:15,370
a lot of shit that I gotta do and take care of. Because I moved and it's very confusing for me

21
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,250
because I live in a different state and I have to file like twice or something. I don't know.

22
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,050
It's a lot of random shit that I haven't ever had to deal with before. So, I need to give

23
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:32,629
the time necessary to get it right. So, you'll see me again. The stream's not like over. What

24
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:37,370
am I doing? You'll see me again. Hey, I'll see you right now. This is the play. Here we go.

25
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:48,300
All right. So, I got the ball. Not all. Almost interception. Just don't pay your taxes.

26
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:58,539
That's not how it works. Just don't pay. That's so... That is such bad advice.

27
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:07,590
All right. We're gonna play Blitz League 2, but I want to make do... There's only been one

28
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:13,669
stream this week and I just want to make sure people are prepared for it. Fucking

29
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:19,980
responsibilities. You know, they're being 33. Why can't I... I want to be like 12 again.

30
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,839
I didn't have to do taxes when I was 12. I didn't have to like take care. I didn't have to have

31
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:37,420
to have like a repairman. No, I... When I was 12, I just was 12. When I was 12, I wanted to be 33.

32
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:45,769
That's weird how that works. 12-hour stream for a 12-year-old streamer.

33
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,129
All right. Did I actually miss the window to press this again?

34
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:59,240
But yeah. I gotta be a good boy and get all my taxes done.

35
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:10,459
And I was trying to find a place to do it and it's always like doing your taxes, especially

36
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:16,300
somebody that gets the kind of income that I get. You know, you just... It's called 1099

37
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:22,519
for those of you that are just curious. I have to do them all myself with the help of obviously

38
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:27,000
like a CPA. So I always... It's always like, all right, I'm gonna do my taxes.

39
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:31,160
Oh, I don't want... I don't wanna. Like I'll do it another day.

40
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:36,519
And then like another like month goes by. No, but I... But I took a time. I can do it like

41
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:41,160
next month. No, you gotta get done. So I have to pick the day that I lock myself

42
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:51,769
in my room for like at least a day or two. And that's tomorrow. So we're gonna pick up. This

43
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:58,699
is the... Unfortunately, this joke doesn't really mean anything anymore because we're

44
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:08,889
Mr. Super Bowl and playing as the Las Vegas Super Bowlers. So that's kind of...

45
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:20,939
It's not gonna really be... That's not funny anymore. I can't edit this team's name either.

46
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:23,660
We can't go in and be like, oh, you know what? I want to change up to like the Las Vegas

47
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:31,319
Dealers. What it should have been. But I listened to the one guy twice for the name of

48
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:39,589
the character and the name of the team. Your mom is so stupid she brought cereal to the Super

49
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:47,350
Bowl. Get that guy out of here. Talk about my mother like that? Get him out of here. All

50
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:51,350
right. So this is Division two. We just leveled up. We just won the Division three

51
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:58,779
championship. Is there anything we need to do? Somebody's injured. Isn't one of our good players

52
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:05,850
injured? Yeah. Halfback D. Sullivan is out for one more game. Unfortunately, we don't have a

53
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:10,410
good halfback. So that's just the way it is. How much money do I have? It's $17,000.

54
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:17,980
We want to know in Division two. I don't understand how American football is played.

55
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:23,160
Keywell, you don't have to. This game... Take away everything you know about sports.

56
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:32,220
This has just hurt each other the game. Okay. Can you hurt somebody else? If the answer is like,

57
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,899
are you like, could you like punch a guy in the face? You could play this game.

58
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:44,889
But hi, Keywell. How you doing? Here comes another beer chug. Yeah. Yeah. You're going

59
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:48,420
to see it like five times. All right. We're going to get our ass kicked here because

60
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,930
no, always the best teams are always the ones that I beat without a problem at all.

61
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:08,379
Drunk streamer? What? 1-0 versus the Crossfire. Every time I don't make a bet either. You know

62
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:12,970
what? Let's go all in. Fuck it. I need to win by 19 points. Let's go.

63
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,210
Okay. So provoke him.

64
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:44,840
So instead of provoke him, we need to get rid of him. Why is he like an, why is he like an animal?

65
00:08:44,840 --> 00:09:01,799
What? Was that a lion? How on earth did this get a sequel? Because it's the best game ever.

66
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:15,740
I'm actually sad that there's not a third one. Hello everybody.

67
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:23,299
It's the Las Vegas Craigsicles. So those of you that weren't here the last stream,

68
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,980
you're probably wondering, he's playing a football game. Oh, how cool is that?

69
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:35,110
Well, you're about to find out why that is. No, it ain't not. You will eventually. You'll find out.

70
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:42,809
Why do you have monsters ink colors? Because that's my favorite movie ever made.

71
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:48,580
All right. I'm the safety. This is my main character here is the character that is the

72
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:58,730
character in the campaign. Oh, I didn't get it. And this is why we play this game guys.

73
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:09,019
You're about to find out. It's just a strain. It's just a neck strain. He's got his brain

74
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:15,929
neck. We got to get him out of here. How long was he out for? Yeah. Get the card out here.

75
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:27,500
That wasn't their star player, was it? I don't think it was. Four plays. That's not bad.

76
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:34,250
All right. I got to stay back. No first down. Don't throw up over there. What are you

77
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:44,299
doing? What's wrong with you? So in the top left and top right, you can see a meter

78
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:48,940
and depending on how much media you have, you can do certain things.

79
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:54,779
So when you get a full meter and it says unleashed is when you can really hurt somebody on these.

80
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:58,620
We're talking like broken neck. We're talking snapping their collarbone off. We're talking

81
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:15,139
like awful shit. They didn't get a first down? Okay. We're fourth down. The fourth

82
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:19,620
down right now in inches. We're going to go with like a field goal block.

83
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:24,500
No, no, no, no. Like this. Oh, fuck. What are they doing? They're punting. Shit. Why?

84
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:37,860
Inches. You have to just walk. Not even. All right. Come on, Raymer. Here we go. Watch this shit.

85
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:51,139
Oh no. Who was that? Was that me? Oh, it's just a sprained knee. It's all right.

86
00:11:52,899 --> 00:12:00,340
I got it. Don't worry. Sprained knee. More like you are not going to walk again.

87
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:07,750
Holy shit. We haven't seen that one. How is that a sprain?

88
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:13,379
Okay. That guy, was that guy like an important player? I don't think he was.

89
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:30,620
Nobody's here. Nobody's here. Stop him. Stop him. That is such a huge gain. We've just got so

90
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:38,039
many yards. No, and there's also like these weird cheerleaders that did the same animation

91
00:12:38,039 --> 00:13:06,179
every time. Somebody cut. Cut. God damn it. That's such horseshit. How? I should have just

92
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:13,620
punched him. It's all right. You got a long way to go. Kick his helmet off. Beat it. Go, go, go, go.

93
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:22,419
Chad is now in re. Oh yeah, that's right. Like don't you should. I think I. Do I have to turn

94
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:33,059
this off? I think I have to turn off the recepts, right? Do I? Get it.

95
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:44,620
How do you not pick up that fumble? Why would I do that? I don't know if it was like a

96
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:54,779
thing that I should do. I don't know. I won't turn it off. I don't know how you

97
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:58,700
catch that ball. That went through four people. Those guys have made it a fucking.

98
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,179
That's the end of the first quarter as we're scoreless.

99
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:13,860
How did that happen? I need to see that again. So I got one, two, three, four defenders. I sack

100
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:21,080
him. He gets the ball out and I ghost through this guy. Three people can't stop him from

101
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,299
catching that. That's what we call in the fucking. Hey, that's what we call in this

102
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:41,460
industry baloney. Well, it's still four down. Sorry. This is the one. Watch this. All right.

103
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:55,960
Now I can't fuck this up. Why? What the hell? Didn't we give them hand lotion last time?

104
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:10,490
I thought I upgraded their hands. Why am I fumbling every single time? Thankfully,

105
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:16,940
they haven't scored any points. There we go. That's what I'm talking about.

106
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:24,019
All right. It's like it never happened. It never should have happened in the first place.

107
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:37,639
All right. Let's go for a run. I don't want to unleash yet. Not unless I need to.

108
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:47,899
All right. I'm afraid to do like a QB sneak here. We're going to go with a pass.

109
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:08,039
All right. I need to get him. Come on. Speed. I'm unleashing here. How do you stop

110
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:27,590
an unleash? That's impossible. Fuck. Okay. Don't fuck it up. Field goal. Okay. That's enough.

111
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:54,570
What? How did that not go through? That didn't go through. How is that not going through?

112
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:17,670
No good. No good. Bad field goal. What? All right. Stick. Who's the guy I need to be

113
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:23,099
looking for? What team are they on? I mean, their team. Are they on offense or defense?

114
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:42,700
Not going to happen. So they're on defense. Okay. You got to break all their legs. I'm going to

115
00:17:42,700 --> 00:18:03,109
score a point. Oh, by the way, I heard that Vinnie hosted me for like 30 seconds or something

116
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:11,079
last stream during I think somebody's brain exploding. And then he immediately unhosted

117
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:15,319
and went live. So everybody got to see like five seconds of somebody's like brain blowing

118
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:22,819
up. And then like Vinnie's stream started. I was when somebody told me that I was fucking

119
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:35,339
laughing like something bad happened. Whoa, I got to catch this. Oh, stand up.

120
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:53,700
Is Cox be acting up here? Nice. Nice taco bell uniform.

121
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:09,000
Oh, I had the ball too. No, why did you say something so funny?

122
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:22,099
I didn't use any time. Oh, my God. Taco Bell. The Las Vegas Taco Bell.

123
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:36,539
Just patted that guy in the back. The Las Vegas Baja Blasters.

124
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:41,019
No, these are the official German 985 colors.

125
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:54,390
I wish I was just sitting down there with a hot babe. Oh, shut up.

126
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:09,859
I can't. Oh, my God. What? Oh, tell me that wasn't his fucking hell. All right. Come on.

127
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,640
We got to go for X. Bang.

128
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,240
Their defense is so good. All right. Fuck it. I'm going for it. Watch this shit.

129
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:28,619
What can we do? We got to boot it. I'm going for it.

130
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:42,970
The defense is so good. They're too good on defense. I have to play defense as good as they

131
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:50,250
are. I have to be as good as they are. The offense looking at first and 30. They're not

132
00:20:50,250 --> 00:21:00,019
going to get shit. All right. That's fine. Not a significant game.

133
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:10,329
He's recovered from his broken ribs. Yeah, that's usually how it happens. Get it.

134
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:25,509
I'm going to play defense better than them. 12 is significant, but they still have 18

135
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:32,900
yards to go. They're going to kick a field goal here and they're going to miss it.

136
00:21:38,569 --> 00:21:41,450
Good luck on your field goal attempt because I'm blocking it.

137
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:50,150
We're a special field goal block. He's the guy who needs it. He needs close.

138
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:54,119
No, they're going for it. Oh, shit. I got to change this.

139
00:21:54,119 --> 00:22:04,250
I can't believe he got it. He used his unleash. That's why.

140
00:22:13,589 --> 00:22:22,059
So stupid. Oh, it's all right. One. I thought the AI never goes forward on fourth down.

141
00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:27,339
You've seen that. Come on. Well, good. Fuck you. You don't get extra point. Now

142
00:22:27,339 --> 00:22:53,319
I can win the game easily. This is the one. All right. That's such a huge game.

143
00:22:53,319 --> 00:23:04,059
I need to take a capitalized ization on this. We're going cold smoke. First and goal. It's

144
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:13,140
gut check time. How did he even get in here? How did he even get the fuck in here?

145
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:25,220
Second and goal. Desperate. Desperate. Here we go. Here I squeezed on his spleen.

146
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:37,190
That's it. Good old cocks. Beer chug, right? I don't think that was beer chug,

147
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:57,589
but I'll be ahead now. I ain't losing this game. When did I get my own stadium?

148
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:05,660
I think I just had one, right? I just had one. Come on. We're the Las Vegas cocks.

149
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:26,490
I'll bust his ankle up for the whole year. Broken foot. Bring out the cart.

150
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:37,829
See you later. All right. Let's play deep. That was going to give him a new foot.

151
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:54,650
End of the quarter. As we reach the end of the third quarter, Las Vegas leads by a point.

152
00:24:54,650 --> 00:25:01,609
How is that a minor injury? Well, in this universe, I think your limbs just,

153
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:05,769
there's like drugs that you inject where it makes your limbs grow back.

154
00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:14,869
They're down and I get the ball and I will make a touchdown and the game will be

155
00:25:14,869 --> 00:25:23,660
unreachable and we'll be, we'll be eight and one. All right. Watch this guy number 15.

156
00:25:27,049 --> 00:25:28,569
Get out of my fucking life.

157
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:38,359
And I have an unleash.

158
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:51,769
Boomer announcer. Now you're going to punt it. Oh fuck. Somebody has to get back there.

159
00:25:51,769 --> 00:26:01,829
Get back there. Somebody, anyone, you know, you're like small. Okay. Check it.

160
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:13,319
All right. We still have an unleash. I'm so ready for this.

161
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:22,039
That's what that is right there. Why would I fake field bill? HB float left down and 30.

162
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:33,779
I don't even need them star player and I still have it. So do they though. All right.

163
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:38,519
I got to get a touchdown right now. We'll go with a trick play. We're going to do maniac.

164
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:42,200
Check that top left corner into the end zone, into the dice

165
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,220
with an unleashing to do an unleashed catch. What just happened?

166
00:26:48,220 --> 00:27:13,769
Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on. Hold on. Come on. What happened?

167
00:27:22,329 --> 00:27:28,940
How did they intercept the ball? I am so confused right now. I can't even like laugh at that.

168
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:37,380
I have no replay. Did he steal the handoff?

169
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:49,990
He ran into the handoff. I have no fucking idea what happened there.

170
00:27:51,190 --> 00:28:09,700
I can't believe it. How do you intercept a handoff? Walk it again.

171
00:28:14,089 --> 00:28:24,009
It's all right. I just need a touchdown and I win the game. Just get a touchdown and the

172
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:28,660
game's over. This is a good position to be in. I got two timeouts. I have no meter,

173
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:37,910
but that's okay. Just don't fumble the goddamn ball. Okay. Here we go.

174
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:42,710
Holy. Good thing he's got insurance. We're going to go intertwine.

175
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:56,259
Gets rid of it. Got it. Come on. Come on. Stay up. He's brought down 38 yard line. Las Vegas

176
00:28:56,259 --> 00:29:00,259
and everyone on the same page there. Okay. I got meter. With a very nice game.

177
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:07,380
Just keep it going. First down 30 yards to go. Wall at the 38.

178
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:16,180
Looking for room on the right side. Damn it. I got to get it right now. Come on.

179
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:38,089
This is it. Right here into the end zone. Recovered in the end zone. That deserves a

180
00:29:38,089 --> 00:29:52,700
shot of a beer. Look at that. Just get a field goal and I win the game properly. That

181
00:29:52,700 --> 00:30:05,640
felt good. That one felt good. Seven seconds to get a field goal. That ain't going to happen.

182
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:22,410
I got meter. He doesn't. Just get a tackle. Two, one. He's okay. He's got one play.

183
00:30:23,049 --> 00:30:27,849
He doesn't have an unleash. He has one play. We're just going to do full coverage here.

184
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:35,720
Complete. Just coverage. Just lock it down. Man up. I don't care how many yards they get.

185
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:51,960
Just stay in the back. See you later. Game over. I win. 14-13. There it is.

186
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:03,289
How much money am I going to get for this one? Off to a good start.

187
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:17,029
I wagered a lot of money, didn't I? Yeah. Oh well. Oh well. 200 grand.

188
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:24,779
I guess that was a really low scoring game, huh? You pulled that one out of your ass and I

189
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:36,380
respect that. I tried. Thanks. Watch the movies. These are the team intros.

190
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:41,380
When they'd introduce the captain of the team. All right. Tara, what's up?

191
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:45,859
Hey there, franchise. I hear you've been asking about me. I think it's time we met

192
00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:50,970
face to face. Cut scene. See you at the club tonight. Okay. Here we go.

193
00:31:53,670 --> 00:32:01,269
Damn. You came ready to play. Franchise. You look short for a football player.

194
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:06,549
Oh, don't play me. I've got all you'll ever need. I'm sure you do, honey,

195
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:12,309
but can you keep up? You'll need to prove it first. Prove it? What are we talking about

196
00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:18,630
here? Show me what you've got on Sunday. Play hard on that field and you can play hard on mine.

197
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:23,589
I like a man who can dish it out. You better be ready. It's gonna get rough.

198
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:32,440
God. I'm looking forward to it. So what do I have to do? Franchise must cause an injury

199
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:39,180
next game. That's what you want me to do? Go hurt someone. That's how you gain my respect.

200
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:49,930
Okay. I think I can handle that. How are we doing on injuries?

201
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:56,859
Sullivan is still up for two games. How? He had, he already had, it's already been one game. He had

202
00:32:56,859 --> 00:33:07,220
medical staff on him. What the hell was that all about? I don't know. I don't think I have

203
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:18,170
enough money for anything. 260, 220. I don't have any money. What about drugs? Let's see.

204
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:28,920
Generate two stamina. Increases the severity of injuries caused by juiced player. So I'm

205
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:34,759
gonna take this and I'm just gonna try to hurt as many. That's a high risk though.

206
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:46,920
I can't do the, look at the risk. I can't do it. It's all, it's maxed out right now. Yeah,

207
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:57,029
I can't do that. I wish I could get my half back back to, you know, who's the,

208
00:33:57,029 --> 00:34:08,199
Atlanta 404 is the next team. Just take the legal ones. Take the legal ones.

209
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:29,820
All of these are illegal. On the left? It's one of the cheapest over-the-counter drugs.

210
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:46,150
Yeah, but I mean, they're gonna be searching my bag. It's illegal. Yeah, but I, so,

211
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:56,519
fine. I'll take it. I'll take the legal drug. It says legal. I know, but just because it's legal

212
00:34:56,519 --> 00:35:07,300
doesn't mean I can do it. They're checking. I just got out of prison. Let's go. Atlanta 404.

213
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:16,039
They have insane defense. I'm not betting on this game. They almost have a maxed out defense.

214
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,800
Next up, we got the Atlanta 404. This team's only been in the league for three years,

215
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,400
but their defense is so destructive, they've already made it into division two.

216
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:39,880
The guy who anchors their defense is Keno Talopa. This guy is a destroyer.

217
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:45,639
6'5", 3'40", fast as hell. The son of a bitch's head should be a registered weapon.

218
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:50,519
When he hits you, it's like a wrecking ball. Do yourself a favor and keep a safe distance.

219
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:53,880
I gotta be aware of this. I gotta be careful.

220
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:06,440
Best defense in the league. You're under arrest for buying those groceries legally.

221
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:21,659
You just never know. He just launches himself into someone. He probably causes a lot of

222
00:36:21,659 --> 00:36:29,989
injuries. So, lockdown defense, and they're a defense team. So, I just have to score a

223
00:36:29,989 --> 00:36:38,230
shitload of points or prevent them from scoring. I get the kickoff. Let's make it happen.

224
00:36:38,789 --> 00:36:39,670
Watch out for the guy.

225
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:50,579
He just hit me so hard, I started to T-pose. This is not going to go well.

226
00:36:52,219 --> 00:37:02,139
Okay. We're going to go with... I don't want to do pass plays. Jesus!

227
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:05,739
Horatious. You gotta wonder how he's going to continue playing after that.

228
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:24,179
All right. Plan B. Oh my god. Oh, this is bad.

229
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:40,820
That defense is so good. They just knock it out of you. Oh, you fucking idiot. What to

230
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:52,949
happen? Okay, I blame that on where my hands were on the controller. I blame where my

231
00:37:52,949 --> 00:38:06,300
hands were. My, like, cold sweat slippery hands. Jesus Christ. Okay. Well, let's get

232
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:10,940
over the fact that I just lost 20% stamina on two people and then got an interception.

233
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:26,059
You can't stop them. They can't be stopped. It's gotten unleashed, too. This is really bad.

234
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:46,869
I'm so afraid of that. Oh, he's going to unleash and kill somebody.

235
00:38:52,969 --> 00:39:08,949
Oh no! Thank god you held onto the ball, Cox. That was a full drop kick.

236
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:24,809
All right. Well, thank god. How the hell am I going to deal with this?

237
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:46,090
Okay. I have to punt it. I have to. I can't go down by 14 points immediately.

238
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:07,219
Atlanta's making you look like a CPU. Well, they did have double my stats. So,

239
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:12,619
you know, there's only so much you can work with here. I'll sit him in the championship

240
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:38,170
and I'll beat him. That's the quarter. That's all right. That's not out of reach.

241
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:47,019
I have to hurt somebody, right? I got to impress my new girlfriend.

242
00:40:47,989 --> 00:41:01,190
Who's gonna get hurt? Huh? How did you catch that ball?

243
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:12,280
Hurt him. Come on. Hurt. Damn it. That was an opportunity to hurt him. I didn't get it,

244
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:20,170
though. I do have an unleash. It's four down. They're probably gonna punt.

245
00:41:21,929 --> 00:41:40,539
Yeah. Here's my chance to get it back. Bryant, let's go. I wasn't gonna use it there.

246
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:49,909
All right. I need to get a touchdown. I'm gonna go with world record crisscross.

247
00:41:50,710 --> 00:42:15,719
First down, 30 yards to go. And he's knocked down. Mercury. Deep pass.

248
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:24,780
I tried to do an unleash but it wouldn't happen. Fuck. I've got to go for a run.

249
00:42:25,739 --> 00:42:54,469
I got to unleash run. Good. There it is. No, get up. Get up. You have a broken humorism.

250
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:22,119
Just get the field goal. Tag him. Dab. It's like it never happens. All the way back. Great kick.

251
00:43:26,619 --> 00:43:32,219
Injure. Injure. Injure. Uh-oh. What the fuck happened? Why do they all just freak out?

252
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:34,699
They all like... Because I was trying to get... Okay. I see what happened. I was trying to

253
00:43:34,699 --> 00:43:49,019
get the... I'm trying to get him. Injured. I know. I'm trying. I'm trying to injure somebody.

254
00:43:49,019 --> 00:43:56,219
I'm afraid to do a blitz but, you know, I'm just gonna stay back.

255
00:44:01,659 --> 00:44:09,820
Injure. Excuse me? Excuse me? Why did he dive through? Hold on. What was that?

256
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:20,539
I fucking dove through him. Look at him. I'm waiting for him. Waiting for him.

257
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:42,139
What the hell? Cartoon dog shit. Whatever. I can't believe it just happened.

258
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:48,710
And the extra point is good. I got his iframe. He dodge rolled me. He was already in a tackle

259
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:55,639
parry. Damn it. I need to... He's gonna get the ball too. I'm gonna have to score a touchdown

260
00:44:55,639 --> 00:45:06,380
right now. And he has an unleash. Get to the fucking outside. And what am I gonna do with

261
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:19,750
this? I wonder if I can get him to burn his unleash. That would be ideal. Cut it. Cut it.

262
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:30,840
Cut out. Cut out. All right. Get it. It's okay. Go outside. Out of bounds. No.

263
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:46,099
Who is this? Oh, it's Ashley. They'll be all right. Out for six games. Fuck. Okay. I still

264
00:45:46,099 --> 00:46:08,440
have a chance here. I got timeout after this. Drop middle. Come on. I gotta get this.

265
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:24,010
Shit. I got him. Okay. We're gonna fake field goal. Touchdown.

266
00:46:50,059 --> 00:47:06,389
Uh, oh well. What were you thinking? I don't know. I don't know why I did that. Injury.

267
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:15,239
Could have done square. Yeah, but I... Every time I've thrown it to a guy that crosses.

268
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:25,980
Just caught my foot. It's extra challenging throwing the guys at three defenders. Injury.

269
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:48,489
Damn it. That was such a good hit too. There it is. It's the quarterback too. He's in deep shit.

270
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:12,650
That was the painful one. And I have an unleash. So third and 26. Just a minor injury

271
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:21,349
to the balls. I don't think so. Not gonna happen. Fourth down. Give me the ball.

272
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:32,059
All right. I'm going to play safe here. Just prevent. Oh, God damn it. He's punting it.

273
00:48:37,139 --> 00:48:41,670
I always think he's going to go for it. And then when it, when he doesn't go for it.

274
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:59,929
It's okay. Check it. Why would he not punt on fourth and 20?

275
00:49:00,809 --> 00:49:03,130
Because this game is insane and they do insane things.

276
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:05,289
First down and 30.

277
00:49:27,829 --> 00:49:34,570
Pretty good mud physics. This game stands up. It does. And so we're back to a tie game.

278
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:48,809
No, I actually forget the beer jug code. I think it's XX circle circle. Rev up the Friars.

279
00:49:48,809 --> 00:50:04,900
I'm in a good spot. The cheerleaders in this game look dead inside.

280
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:08,659
They do have that kind of just stone cold face, don't they?

281
00:50:09,619 --> 00:50:15,239
First down 30 yards to go. Ball at the 27 yard line.

282
00:50:19,739 --> 00:50:32,539
Watch the left side. I got nothing. I would be too if I was dancing in this weather.

283
00:50:34,139 --> 00:50:42,469
Yeah. Balance. We're going to go with jammer. I don't even know.

284
00:50:43,269 --> 00:50:45,829
Guys, I just want to make sure this is clear with everybody watching.

285
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:55,110
I, I don't know what any of these mean. I mean, I have a general idea, but I don't really follow

286
00:50:55,110 --> 00:51:00,309
football that much. I don't know. Like for instance, I know like cover and blitz and

287
00:51:00,309 --> 00:51:02,949
zone. I don't know what any of these things really mean though.

288
00:51:04,309 --> 00:51:07,909
I'm doing the thing where you play Madden against your friend and neither one of you

289
00:51:07,909 --> 00:51:10,469
know what the fuck you're doing. You're just picking random plays.

290
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:27,559
Having a great time though. I have no idea. Does it matter? Not really.

291
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:33,719
Okay. This is fourth and 31. I wonder if he's going to punt it.

292
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,650
Why are you allowed just to beat people up? Because this is blitz.

293
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:48,920
I might be able to run this back for touchdown. Possible.

294
00:51:51,139 --> 00:51:58,780
There we go. Touchdown. Got it. Oh, I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

295
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:06,280
And he's in. Touchdown. Have to say this guy puts the special in special teams. Why the heaven?

296
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:16,099
All right. Good. Good. Good. Turn on the face cam. I don't have any clothes on. I can't.

297
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:23,460
Do I just say fuck it and try to go for it? Fuck it. Right up the middle.

298
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:45,980
That was a mistake. Yeah, it was. I tend to make those here.

299
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:55,079
And so with three quarters gone, Las Vegas leads by six. I wanted to try to make it so if you got

300
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:59,000
a touchdown, it wouldn't have mattered. But now all he needs is a touchdown to win.

301
00:53:01,429 --> 00:53:06,710
And I'm embarrassed. I'm ashamed. First and 30. Ball at the 25 yard line.

302
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:22,230
Do you have a six pack? Yeah, dude. Bullshit. Yeah, dude. Let's go with deep zones.

303
00:53:27,219 --> 00:53:30,179
Jerma works out every night. No, I mean, I did 500 crunches a day.

304
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:46,329
Half a dozen donuts is not six pack. Yes, it is. I do at least five. I probably do. No,

305
00:53:46,329 --> 00:53:58,550
you know, I probably do a thousand crunches a day. No, no, no, no, no. How is it fucking

306
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:04,949
possible? That auto of all people. How many tackles are you going to break after a fumble?

307
00:54:04,949 --> 00:54:21,289
Really? What? This is un fucking believable. That's unbelievable. He broke like seven or

308
00:54:21,289 --> 00:54:28,230
eight different tackles. After a fucking fumble. Guy gets it and just covers himself in oil and

309
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:47,030
then runs through. Fuck. Second and goal. Bad. Pumple. I popped his fucking water balloon.

310
00:54:47,030 --> 00:55:04,460
Good. I haven't unleashed to third and goal. This is the game right here. I have to,

311
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:06,780
I have to unleash right here. He's got to be because he's going to get a field goal,

312
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:19,380
right? Unleash it. Why were they walking off the field? We need to stop them right here,

313
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:28,059
right now. Okay. Um, are they going for it? It's all or nothing.

314
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:39,829
Nothing. Yeah. He's tackled at the two yard line and they turn the ball over. Now they

315
00:55:39,829 --> 00:55:46,309
could have used some points right there, but the defense said, no way. I got an unleash too.

316
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:56,619
Surprised. I actually, um, didn't unleash that one. Same deal. Run it before the game,

317
00:55:56,619 --> 00:56:02,500
huh? Run it. They don't got any more time outs and then fucking punt it if I have to.

318
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:33,369
See you later. Break the tackle. I just like fell down. Game over. I win.

319
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:43,659
Keep that record going. Did I just walk across the field and sprinkle somebody?

320
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:59,960
I think I, yeah, I just, that was awesome. That's a win. Another close call, but still

321
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:11,719
able to keep it going. Now I got $430,000. I injured somebody. So I'm going to get a new

322
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:32,440
girlfriend, right? Man enough for Tara. $5,000 cash. Okay. Let's see what that means. Here's

323
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:39,610
Tara. You do know how to, let's get together tonight so you can try some of your moves on

324
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:55,219
me. What? No. Well, uh, sure. I guess hope this might be bad. I might have to, uh,

325
00:57:55,619 --> 00:58:00,019
okay. Let's, uh, hope you don't mind. I brought a friend.

326
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:11,110
And incoming sensor ruptured spleen. I'm going to like fall out of bed and rupture my spleen.

327
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:22,250
I'm going to roll out of bed and like explode my collarbone.

328
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:30,699
You're taking them on two at a time now? You got to pace yourself, brother.

329
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:33,260
Next time since I'm that booty my way. Yeah.

330
00:58:37,849 --> 00:58:42,099
Son, do you know how fast you were going? I was going 70. 68.

331
00:58:47,369 --> 00:58:56,949
Oh, this is not good. Do I answer this phone? Oh, real nice. You jerk. I can't believe you

332
00:58:56,949 --> 00:59:12,119
did this to me. And with her, don't call me again. Hey killer. How are you doing?

333
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:19,179
You need anything besides me? That is look, I know people, people who can get me the stuff

334
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:24,219
I already had it. And I could get it at cost. Just don't ask me where or how.

335
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:28,619
Let me know what you need and how much. I don't want, I don't want like an illegal

336
00:59:28,619 --> 00:59:35,050
girlfriend. You know what I mean? Like do any legal things. Kim was by the book. This is like

337
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:39,369
illegal girlfriend. Oh, I did. I do things illegally. No, I want my, I, where's, I want

338
00:59:39,369 --> 01:00:01,909
Kim back. Tara gets you drug discounts. I'm in love. Those are expensive. Okay. We need

339
01:00:02,869 --> 01:00:14,280
some resist injury, break tackle, maybe, or strength. This game is something else.

340
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:28,389
It is a timeless classic. I'm going to say strength and these two weights. Yeah. Strength.

341
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:37,690
I got 150. How much of a discount though? That's all I can do. Who's still injured? Okay.

342
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:43,900
Oh man. Oh man. That's not good. Five games. Okay. So we got the,

343
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:50,840
our good halfback is in the game again. I need some more medical staff. How much is

344
01:00:50,840 --> 01:01:02,659
the point? Yeah, I just get it. Good. Juicing. Let's see how much of a discount it is.

345
01:01:04,679 --> 01:01:09,239
Seven. That's, that's a monumental discount. This was like what? 60. This was like 50 or

346
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:24,139
60 thousand dollars before. This is so cheap now. Juiced player is immune to injury. It

347
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:33,829
wasn't like that before, was it? Well, I'll take the legal one. I'm going to give the

348
01:01:33,829 --> 01:01:43,849
halfback, I'm going to get the halfback a legal drug too. Everyone's going to take aspirin.

349
01:01:44,329 --> 01:01:50,659
What the hell this is? What? Okay. What about the catcher? Should the catcher have something?

350
01:01:54,900 --> 01:02:06,659
Lame streamer. Look at the team risk. If I take an illegal drug right now. Who's up next? We

351
01:02:06,659 --> 01:02:23,690
got the Washington Redhawks. Okay. Scroll down on the injuries. Oh shit. That's right.

352
01:02:26,969 --> 01:02:34,039
No, this is the only two. That was the only two that are there. All right. I got to,

353
01:02:35,159 --> 01:02:39,110
hey, it's been an hour. That means I got to pee. So welcome to the, the,

354
01:02:39,110 --> 01:02:44,949
the bi-hourly, but quarterly hourly piss. First one of the night. See you in a minute.

355
01:02:44,949 --> 01:06:11,590
How did he go? So we're a new game versus the, uh, versus Washington. All right. Not as awful

356
01:06:11,590 --> 01:06:25,059
as, oh and three. Hmm. Win by more than 10 points. Did I wash my hands? Yeah. I rinsed

357
01:06:25,139 --> 01:06:36,380
them and I did soap. 25,000 max bet to a team that's oh and three.

358
01:06:37,019 --> 01:06:42,630
They're not very, the stat wise, they're not that much better. I'm max betting it.

359
01:06:43,429 --> 01:06:50,440
Let's try. The Washington Redhawks have one of the most explosive offenses in the league.

360
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:56,679
Quarterback Clayton West got with the league MVP. Now he's recording his own rap album.

361
01:06:56,679 --> 01:07:04,150
He is still a damn good quarterback. Fame's gone straight to his head.

362
01:07:05,110 --> 01:07:12,710
The former face of the league is now a giant douchebag. In other words, he's just right

363
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:34,630
in with the rest of the Redhawks. So, Andrew, is what you're saying. Break him, break him.

364
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:46,710
Look, I'm going to try. That's what I do every game. I go for, I go for the attack.

365
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:53,929
Good evening everyone. I'm not going to ever be able to think about anything besides Taco Bell

366
01:07:53,929 --> 01:08:03,880
now. I laughed about it even on the way downstairs. Break his neck. I'm, look, I'm

367
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:09,980
going to try to do whatever I can. Ow. He's a quarterback, right?

368
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:16,470
Good thing he's got insurance. Let's start off with just a

369
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:25,380
fucked up trick play. I didn't, did I not pick one?

370
01:08:38,409 --> 01:08:41,529
Fumble it again. Fumble. Fumble, fumble, fumble, fumble. Give it back.

371
01:09:00,869 --> 01:09:09,210
That was loud and scary. I tried to go in for the kill there.

372
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:20,970
A little more juice. Shit. Why did I, I did like a bomb pass the first play of the game.

373
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:35,659
Blade hit. Gun unleashed. I think I gotta go for it here.

374
01:09:41,689 --> 01:09:52,170
Got it. Oh, watch this one. Run it back for a touchdown right now. See you later.

375
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:09,449
Yes. Let's make them 0 and 4.

376
01:10:15,289 --> 01:10:23,640
Really pushing your luck there. Well, if I had got tackled, I would have blamed it in the end.

377
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:47,989
That's not a good kick at all. Fumble. Drunk Madden. He has no commentary at all.

378
01:10:47,989 --> 01:10:54,329
By the way, there is no commentary. First down and 30. The guy just says the name of the

379
01:10:54,409 --> 01:10:59,369
play, what yardage it is. And then drunk John Madden talks about like diapers.

380
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:33,859
Fumble. Oh, fumble. I killed him, but he didn't fumble the ball. Spinal cord. No,

381
01:11:33,859 --> 01:11:55,000
he's not dead. They got somebody yards on that too. I ain't gonna happen. Get that late hit.

382
01:11:55,560 --> 01:12:11,300
Let's go to the bottom edge. I gotta go for an injury here. I'm not gonna get it. He's in a

383
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:23,689
bad spot right now. He's in like 73, 74. And I have an unleash. Third and goal. Hmm. Question

384
01:12:23,689 --> 01:12:31,529
is do I use the unleash now and try to prevent a touchdown, but they'll get a field goal or do I?

385
01:12:35,770 --> 01:12:41,619
I'll take it. Didn't even need to use it. I got my halfback back.

386
01:12:42,340 --> 01:13:02,010
28 is back. Let's get out of the fucking end zone. Get out. Oh, look at me.

387
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:25,859
Wow. That was awesome. That is exactly what I wanted to have happen. 99 yard run.

388
01:13:26,579 --> 01:13:43,350
Fumble with MVP. Yeah. We didn't have him for at least two or three games straight.

389
01:13:44,069 --> 01:14:04,170
That was a 100 yard. That guy deserves extra drugs after this game. Yeah, definitely. He

390
01:14:04,170 --> 01:14:21,350
deserves extra drugs. First down, 30 yards to go. You know, Mr. Super Bowl. I'm kind of surprised

391
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:44,899
that he got away from that. He's really fast. No. Let's go over like a blitz. Goodbye. See

392
01:14:44,899 --> 01:15:05,510
you later. That deserves a chuck. I'm up by so much now. Well, I told you there's a reason why

393
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:31,399
you're only free. Let's go for it. 22 to zero. Have you considered becoming a professional NFL

394
01:15:31,399 --> 01:15:40,649
blitz player? Yeah, I have. There's only one problem though. I think I'm the only person

395
01:15:40,649 --> 01:15:49,800
that owns this game right now. So I would be, it'd be an AI tournament. If the NFL blitz the league

396
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:57,130
two tournament series, it would just be me against AI opponents in a giant stadium.

397
01:16:04,470 --> 01:16:06,550
See you later to the quarterback. That's like a broken tailbone.

398
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:24,680
That's the guy that I had to go after. Five games. There's the start player. They don't

399
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:36,359
have a chance trying to injure their other quarterback. What happens if you run into all

400
01:16:36,359 --> 01:16:51,460
quarterbacks? Do you have to have like the safety play quarterback? Fourth down. You're

401
01:16:51,460 --> 01:17:01,319
gonna have to punt it. All right, punch that guy in the face. Get him. Do it.

402
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:12,899
There goes my appetite. Yeah, this is probably in a good game to eat too.

403
01:17:16,819 --> 01:17:19,659
I'm about to get the ball back again.

404
01:17:24,789 --> 01:17:32,039
Good thing he's not pregnant. First and 30. I'm gonna go with the, uh, try.

405
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:43,989
Uh-oh. No, not 28. Not 28 again. He's fine. Thank God. He would have been out

406
01:17:43,989 --> 01:18:06,739
for four games. Awesome juke. Thank God. Time out. Let me get, let me get a touchdown here.

407
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:14,069
Crucial series of downs here. Ball spotted at the 13 yard line.

408
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:23,079
Two point conversion again. I bet on this game, didn't I? Yeah, I did.

409
01:18:27,479 --> 01:18:29,560
I put max at $25,000 on this game.

410
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:53,340
Fuck, now I gotta kick it off. Idiot. Three seconds for them to score a touchdown.

411
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:57,020
Let's just prevent. We're gonna go just straight up,

412
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:03,289
four men in the backfield. They're going for a bomb pass.

413
01:19:11,619 --> 01:19:21,859
The announcer's Frank Galliendo. I gotta get more. This is the kind of game you have to make

414
01:19:21,859 --> 01:19:28,380
money because this team sucks. So I already have at least 50 grand coming in from the bet.

415
01:19:33,850 --> 01:19:39,689
Somebody pick it up. That's what I'm talking about. Just get like fucking 500 grand from

416
01:19:39,689 --> 01:20:00,920
this game. Shut out. It's all right. It's still game. Let's run it in there.

417
01:20:06,869 --> 01:20:14,069
It's all right. Just get in there slowly. Turn up the difficulty.

418
01:20:28,439 --> 01:20:47,659
Easy. Now I have to win these by a lot. Do the beer chug on cam. He flew in the air.

419
01:20:49,399 --> 01:21:02,039
I'm gonna take the shot. I'm gonna try to win by 50 points. 50 to 0. That's what I'm going for

420
01:21:02,039 --> 01:21:21,859
here. This guy's down at 60%. One bad injury to this guy. He'll have a play again. Crush,

421
01:21:21,859 --> 01:21:41,260
we're going with the Blitz. Just take everybody over here. No fumble. Can somebody actually get

422
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:47,560
murdered? Yeah, they can go out for the whole year. Or forever, I think. My character

423
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:56,039
like died in the game, didn't he? Technically. Who caught it? Um, excuse me. I don't. There's

424
01:21:56,039 --> 01:22:07,140
no explanation for what just happened. I don't. Who caught that ball? Okay, he dodges that

425
01:22:07,779 --> 01:22:16,260
and then threw it over here. The guy behind him caught it without looking. It went into

426
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:29,460
his hands. I was trying to tackle that guy and I did tackle that guy. He's weird. He

427
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:35,029
was running the opposite direction without looking. It went right into his hand. How do

428
01:22:35,029 --> 01:23:01,260
you miss that? Both of you. It's okay. No shut out, bud. Jeremy, you've landed like 50 punches on

429
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:19,659
camera. All right, let's go with the run. Here comes his unleash. It's probably going to be

430
01:23:19,659 --> 01:23:23,020
a fumble or an injured player. So I don't know why I'm giving it to my star player.

431
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:31,029
I'm so terrified of it. Don't give the ball to that. It's time to just play

432
01:23:33,399 --> 01:23:37,159
easy. No reason to give it to the halfback anymore. Not at this point.

433
01:23:40,439 --> 01:24:03,979
And I gave it to him! Red zone stood again. Uh, this time we're gonna do Bolton. Hide in.

434
01:24:08,859 --> 01:24:28,229
Oh well. It was worth a shot. Forget it. 1,000 yards season. That's my star player.

435
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:40,439
Thank god. I think if franchise gets an injury, the game ends. So just keep that in mind. That's

436
01:24:40,439 --> 01:24:59,270
why I was a little concerned there. How did I not get that? Still got it. I don't know how.

437
01:24:59,270 --> 01:25:02,470
Wow. 50 points.

438
01:25:07,909 --> 01:25:33,899
What do you say you chug it? 50 points. Let's go again. Quarterback dash. There's no way he's

439
01:25:33,899 --> 01:25:53,510
gonna do that twice in a row, right? Things are going well 50 to 6. And I still haven't

440
01:25:53,510 --> 01:26:00,149
unleashed it. I'm going to use it right now. What percentage is this guy at right now? How

441
01:26:00,229 --> 01:26:12,680
can you still be standing? It's alright. Why did he just die?

442
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:25,659
The guy that fell down is the one that got the hit. I love him. This is on PlayStation 3.

443
01:26:29,989 --> 01:26:41,260
Yeah, not on Xbox right now. PS3. Oh yeah! He deserves it. You deserve it. Yeah, you

444
01:26:41,260 --> 01:27:07,689
deserve it. You're not kicking a field goal. Run the whole thing back. Come on. What does

445
01:27:07,689 --> 01:27:30,890
this mean? This is just a failed conversion. I was trying to build up points. Well, it

446
01:27:30,890 --> 01:27:36,220
doesn't matter. Dermot, that's two points. I thought it was just a, no, it's a two-point

447
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:43,430
conversion, right? So I thought that's just a failed conversion. Not the halfback, please.

448
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:59,579
God damn it. First game, you come back. Of the seven games. God, Jesus. What?

449
01:28:15,689 --> 01:28:29,529
That sucks. That actually sucks. Triangle, triangle, triangle, X. I'll try it.

450
01:28:43,479 --> 01:28:48,279
He's gonna get it. I don't care. I'm just, I'm playing like a clown right now because it

451
01:28:48,279 --> 01:29:13,270
doesn't matter. Some kind of currency thing. Is it? I don't know. How long is the story mode?

452
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:22,520
Uh, we are currently in the second division of one more division. So the division two,

453
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:28,420
division one. And I'm assuming like the championship of the whole game. So it seems

454
01:29:28,420 --> 01:29:37,500
like we're halfway through the second division we're all about to be.

455
01:29:43,430 --> 01:29:50,569
End them right now or I'm gonna leave, or I'm going. Um, I've, I've taken out at least like

456
01:29:50,569 --> 01:30:07,319
four people on their team. You can't leave now. You can't leave. I just silly potted that guy's

457
01:30:07,319 --> 01:30:39,939
back. Look at me. This is embarrassing.

458
01:30:46,359 --> 01:31:00,470
58 to 12. Fucking cares. Oh, I was trying to be like, I was trying to BM their team.

459
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:10,630
They'll help with this for the ultimate BM. No, he's still, still okay. First and 30.

460
01:31:11,270 --> 01:31:30,390
All right, let me BM their quarterback. Yeah, whatever. Let them have it. You got a touchdown.

461
01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:41,239
Congratulations. Las Vegas will take this one. Oh no, I'm gonna make so much money.

462
01:31:45,289 --> 01:31:55,399
64, 128,000, 45,000, 36. Oh wow. Look at that. 433 grand.

463
01:31:55,479 --> 01:32:11,460
Okay, now let's go see how the halfback is doing. Also, uh, 25 minutes ago or so,

464
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:17,319
Great Canadian Fuck Club gave, uh, I think eight community subs here.

465
01:32:19,109 --> 01:32:32,819
Thank you, Great Canadian. Lifestyle. Girlfriends. Tarot. Okay, you can go get

466
01:32:32,819 --> 01:32:37,060
almost any type of juice at discounted rates. Do I even have any sponsors anymore?

467
01:32:38,859 --> 01:32:51,619
I guess so. All right, let's go to injuries. Six games. One game. The whole,

468
01:32:51,619 --> 01:32:58,439
good, that's, that's fine. Here's a problem though. This is my backup halfback. This

469
01:32:58,439 --> 01:33:07,460
is my main halfback. I got, I got the third replacement here. I got the second backup

470
01:33:07,460 --> 01:33:18,359
in the game. That's not good. All those halfback plays I'm gonna have to slow down on.

471
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:29,000
What do you think? Hands maybe? Block? Yeah, we need better blocks. Either that or better

472
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:41,220
break tackle. Resist injury. That's another good one. Yeah, it's important. And then block.

473
01:33:45,659 --> 01:33:49,739
53 grand. Let's take a look at juicing. What have we got? Team risk is still pretty damn

474
01:33:49,739 --> 01:34:04,119
high. Just take the ones that you know. Hey, look, this guy like Baxter. It's legal. Don't

475
01:34:04,119 --> 01:34:16,409
worry. So 4-0. Wins to advance one. So I just have to win one more game. And I'm guaranteed

476
01:34:17,050 --> 01:34:29,579
to be able to play to advance. 4-0. Chicago Marauders are the next team.

477
01:34:34,949 --> 01:34:40,380
So there's three more games. I just got to win one more of these games. Shouldn't be too big

478
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:51,770
of a problem. Let's go. Defense got better. No, no, that's, oh, that's us. No, no, no,

479
01:34:52,170 --> 01:35:04,119
I'm 4-0. I still got a better team. More than 23 points. I'll put 10 grand on it. I already

480
01:35:04,119 --> 01:35:11,859
played, I think, the best team in the division. Max bet? Sure. We're taking on the Chicago Marauder.

481
01:35:11,859 --> 01:35:17,720
Quarterback Shane Spade is a gladiator in the Windy City. 18 years in the league and still

482
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:26,100
battling. Spade may not scramble like he used to. Just make sure you get to him before he

483
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:40,069
makes the throw. A lot of quarterbacks as captains in this division. We're gonna have

484
01:35:40,069 --> 01:35:54,329
to take care of them. That guy's form is really bad. Yeah, that guy has the same amount of

485
01:35:55,130 --> 01:36:00,359
skill and form that I do when I go to the driving range. How many guys play golf?

486
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:05,560
How many guys don't play golf and just go and swing away at the driving range?

487
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:12,859
I used to all the time. It was so much fun. The division two campaign is well underway

488
01:36:12,859 --> 01:36:17,020
and most people around this team are feeling good about their chances going forward. And

489
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:24,890
now let's get ready for the kickoff. I haven't in a long time. Nobody plays golf with it,

490
01:36:24,890 --> 01:36:47,979
but people still go to the range. And please. Thank you, Sans. Already chanting bullshit.

491
01:36:47,979 --> 01:37:00,949
That was the kickoff return. Fuck. That's good, good, good, good, good. No, no, no.

492
01:37:00,949 --> 01:37:13,140
They got a break. Be back in like two plays. Four plays. Always goes for the ass.

493
01:37:13,779 --> 01:37:17,140
Crucial series of downs here. Ball at the 17 yard line.

494
01:37:20,659 --> 01:37:36,149
Guys, can somebody tackle him? That was almost the whole team. Blitz is my guy.

495
01:37:39,300 --> 01:38:01,819
Shit. It's okay. Whole team can stop one guy. Usually how it works, right? Max bet. Don't

496
01:38:01,819 --> 01:38:15,270
worry. Shit. All right. I got the ball. He definitely is not going to remember.

497
01:38:15,270 --> 01:38:27,239
We're going to go disaster and right in the middle. No, what?

498
01:38:29,479 --> 01:38:35,369
What are you doing? Why? Not good. This is not good.

499
01:38:40,729 --> 01:38:51,140
Well, this is not good. Whose head is this? I bumped my head on him and he broke it.

500
01:38:51,699 --> 01:39:10,579
And he's still up. Oh my God. Why? What the fuck? Why are they so good? They're

501
01:39:10,579 --> 01:39:20,569
on a bunch of drugs. They have to be. Well, I don't have my good halfback.

502
01:39:23,159 --> 01:39:26,840
Okay. I keep forgetting. Don't do any plays that require the halfback to run.

503
01:39:27,399 --> 01:39:31,380
That is the second replacement halfback. Why would I do that?

504
01:39:44,890 --> 01:39:56,020
So if I don't have any halfbacks, who is the halfback? All right. Come on. No.

505
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:03,399
That's why I was hugging the right side.

506
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:19,340
Okay. First down. Guards to go. Here we go. I can come back. Just play smart.

507
01:40:20,659 --> 01:40:26,810
Don't do anything fancy. Just do smart plays. I wish I wasn't so hung over.

508
01:40:26,810 --> 01:40:35,659
I'm going to drag across. Let's see if we can get the guy across. Bingo. Got it.

509
01:40:36,460 --> 01:40:40,939
Just fucking play smart. I just got to get a few more yards. Third and nine.

510
01:40:45,000 --> 01:41:02,579
Fuck it. Down. Down yourself. Down yourself. Slowly but surely. End of the quarter.

511
01:41:02,579 --> 01:41:09,109
And that's the end of the first quarter as Chicago leads by 13. He's getting nervous.

512
01:41:10,069 --> 01:41:13,430
Yeah. When you're down by 13, you've got to... Of course I'm going to be nervous.

513
01:41:15,180 --> 01:41:26,140
Let's go with lightning. First and 30. Sir, don't let him catch that.

514
01:41:32,819 --> 01:41:44,649
Let's try this one. Why? That could have been a big play if the ball would have gotten

515
01:41:44,649 --> 01:41:53,659
to him before the defender. Fucking halfback. No. I can't do any halfback plays. He's so bad.

516
01:42:04,390 --> 01:42:15,689
Get out of my life. Oh. Beer truck. Right? I don't know. How's the halfback going to

517
01:42:15,689 --> 01:42:17,770
get better if you don't use him? He's not supposed to be in the game.

518
01:42:25,829 --> 01:42:55,130
I need this. Get up. Fuck. Get a fumble. Look at how hurt he is. Fumble. Strip it.

519
01:42:55,770 --> 01:42:59,689
This guy's at 48%. How the hell are you holding onto the ball?

520
01:43:02,100 --> 01:43:24,949
48%. And he got unleashed. Nobody can hold onto that. I'm not sure there's anybody on Earth.

521
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:37,430
Who got the ball at the... Thank you. Somebody came across and made it happen.

522
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:45,020
Third and 19. I'm going to just lock it down. I'm going to hang out back here.

523
01:43:45,739 --> 01:44:09,500
They're gonna punt it. See what... I can't late hit him. Punt. Although Bryant's not looking so good.

524
01:44:19,449 --> 01:44:24,229
Oh, that was embarrassing. It's okay. Let's try this one.

525
01:44:24,949 --> 01:44:39,029
Wide receiver. They got a lot of... Let's go right side then. Bingo. Who gets the ball to half?

526
01:44:39,029 --> 01:44:58,310
Me? Hurry up. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Nice. Power wide. Is this going to

527
01:44:58,310 --> 01:45:07,699
the halfback? All right. Time to shine, halfback. Come on, Baxter. Baxter, I love you.

528
01:45:10,779 --> 01:45:35,770
Okay. I'm just going to go for a tie game. The chug joke is getting old. It's not a joke.

529
01:45:36,579 --> 01:45:39,460
It's just in the three seconds that I have to do that, it's the only one that I've

530
01:45:39,460 --> 01:45:55,399
completely memorized. Totally. Why does it keep doing the same shit? All right. Time for an

531
01:45:55,399 --> 01:46:23,210
injury. Oh. How are you back in two plays? I don't know how that's possible, but okay.

532
01:46:27,510 --> 01:46:33,289
Shattered bones. Where are you going? Where are you going? Give me a touchdown right now.

533
01:46:34,420 --> 01:46:41,029
Oh, get out of my fucking face. No, why did you run outside? Oh, I'm so annoyed by that.

534
01:46:41,029 --> 01:46:52,149
Why did you go outside? Unbelievable. That sucks. He drop kicked him in the face and

535
01:46:52,149 --> 01:47:01,050
ended up running outside on his own. I didn't do that because I did the drop kick.

536
01:47:04,039 --> 01:47:20,859
I'm very, very upset about that. Fucking asshole. Oh, damn it. The game hates me.

537
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:25,180
I had an opportunity to be up and now like a fucking interception

538
01:47:26,140 --> 01:47:30,949
because I kicked a guy in the face and jumped out of bounds.

539
01:47:35,180 --> 01:47:52,260
Fuck you. Recovered from a broken forearm. There's a lot of drugs involved guys.

540
01:47:52,260 --> 01:48:03,800
I thought I had it. You don't catch that. It's impossible. You're both are putting your

541
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:31,829
hands in the air. Stop it. Block this. We got a game now. It's been a while. It's

542
01:48:31,829 --> 01:48:47,180
been at least two or three games since we've had a game. Oh, their defense is so good for

543
01:48:47,180 --> 01:49:19,100
some reason. And they have a fucking unleashed. I gotta watch this shit. Oops, a daisy is bad.

544
01:49:29,979 --> 01:49:34,329
Fucking Sullivan has to be hurt again. Just fucking

545
01:49:51,180 --> 01:49:56,699
on that plate. It's so stupid. I don't deserve it, but I'll take it. That's fine with me.

546
01:49:57,739 --> 01:50:09,880
You know, I talked a lot of shit about Baxter, but he really is the only person

547
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:29,319
that's what's the, what is the code? Triangle, three triangles in one X,

548
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:43,100
triangle square XO, triangle square XO, triangle square XO. That's what somebody said.

549
01:50:45,399 --> 01:50:54,010
One guy did say that. You're right. Triangle square XO.

550
01:50:55,350 --> 01:51:19,180
Is that the joke that it's stuck to me? We got a game. The touchdown codes are in the menu.

551
01:51:19,180 --> 01:51:24,680
Yeah, I only have four of them. I don't think you can do any of them unless they're here

552
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:29,779
because we tried them before. Beer Chug really is the best one of these four.

553
01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:45,130
There's only four codes. You have to unlock them. That's what I figured.

554
01:51:46,010 --> 01:51:56,520
Looks like it's gonna be Beer Chug. Don't hurt him. Not good. Drop that ball.

555
01:52:01,430 --> 01:52:03,270
Bumble. Oh, I'm sorry.

556
01:52:13,819 --> 01:52:21,430
And ruin that guy's life. Well, we're in Blitz. We're in the Blitz League.

557
01:52:25,350 --> 01:52:26,550
Just give me one second here.

558
01:52:26,550 --> 01:52:41,619
At least he's going for a few games instead of a few plays. Yeah, that's true.

559
01:52:42,420 --> 01:52:55,020
Was it third down? Second down. Second to 17. Not gonna happen. Third down.

560
01:52:58,300 --> 01:53:05,930
Got an unleash. I'm gonna hold on to it. It's 20-20. Stay. Let's go. Just deep zones.

561
01:53:06,899 --> 01:53:09,539
Quarterback passes all the damn time. Just gonna block it.

562
01:53:15,189 --> 01:53:21,180
I can't fucking believe that just happens. What happened here?

563
01:53:23,050 --> 01:53:33,619
I was ready for him right here. Okay, here's the chain of events here.

564
01:53:34,260 --> 01:53:38,739
This guy doesn't tackle. Instead, I come across with franchise. Try to do the tackle. Don't

565
01:53:38,739 --> 01:53:43,939
get it. This guy tackles franchise. And that guy fell down because I grabbed his toe. Great.

566
01:53:44,899 --> 01:53:50,119
Good work, guys. As we reach the end of the third quarter, we're tied.

567
01:54:00,779 --> 01:54:08,390
I don't want to use the unleash, though. Make him kick a field goal and then I can

568
01:54:08,390 --> 01:54:23,529
use the unleash to get a touchdown. Don't let him get it. No unleash. Not necessary. Don't do it.

569
01:54:33,670 --> 01:54:41,960
Use unleash to defend? I don't think I need to right now. See you later. That's the

570
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:56,680
quarterback. Oh, Brake is back. Best thing that could have happened. Get their backup quarterback

571
01:54:56,680 --> 01:55:00,359
in here. Fourth goal. They're going for a field goal? I don't know. What are they doing?

572
01:55:01,159 --> 01:55:12,680
They're going for a field goal. Block it. Don't go. No go. No good. No, it wasn't.

573
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:39,180
It bounced off the middle. What? Oh, it bounced in. Touchdown wins the game. All right.

574
01:55:39,819 --> 01:55:43,109
I got a false set of downs here to get at least a field goal.

575
01:55:50,409 --> 01:55:57,189
Rip the bet. Yeah, that's all right. I need to win the game. How many yards is that?

576
01:55:57,189 --> 01:56:09,350
Eight? Not very much. Wide open. Why would you jump and land on your back?

577
01:56:10,840 --> 01:56:27,319
What did you do that for? Why would you do that? Catch it and turn around. I don't need

578
01:56:27,399 --> 01:56:52,630
to use time up, but I panicked. I just did. I gotta play defense. That should be the game.

579
01:56:53,430 --> 01:57:23,340
Field goal won't win it. Don't get this blocked. Defense. They have no unleash.

580
01:57:24,220 --> 01:57:33,029
Play smart. You gotta be fucking kidding me. You've gotta be kidding me. No, somebody get him.

581
01:57:33,750 --> 01:57:56,300
Oh, I can't believe it. It's a fake. Okay. All right. All right. 27 great. I need a field goal.

582
01:58:02,649 --> 01:58:07,770
Field goal is all I need. Just get there. No, run it back for a fucking touchdown right now.

583
01:58:10,810 --> 01:58:19,260
Get into field goal range. Am I field goal range? I'm so fucked. My heart is just

584
01:58:19,260 --> 01:58:33,510
pounding right now. What the hell? I have one time out. Oh, come on. I'm just panicking.

585
01:58:33,909 --> 01:58:40,890
I gotta kick a field goal. Fuck. How far am I away? I'm fucked.

586
01:59:07,750 --> 01:59:40,090
I shouldn't have lost that fucking game. The run back for a touchdown just gets slippery

587
01:59:40,090 --> 01:59:45,609
bullshit. I make like two tackles and he just bribes it. Fuck off. All right. I'm

588
01:59:45,689 --> 02:00:08,979
nine and two right now, agent. I'm so mad right now. Fucking hell. Miami Hammerheads. I'm so

589
02:00:08,979 --> 02:00:16,739
unreasonably upset. Yeah. All right. Injuries. Finally, I get my halfback who is one of the best

590
02:00:16,739 --> 02:00:22,659
halfbacks in the league and he's in the game. I wonder if I'll have him for one game and then

591
02:00:22,659 --> 02:00:38,140
he'll break a bone and be gone for two games. Baxter is great. Don't fuck Baxter. Go back

592
02:00:38,140 --> 02:00:57,449
to experimenting on flies and the Ninja Turtles. I don't think it can do anything. 2-11. No,

593
02:00:57,449 --> 02:01:06,119
fuck you, Gerva. No, I'm kidding. Baxter was the only one that did anything, but I can't

594
02:01:06,119 --> 02:01:10,779
believe they ran it back for a touchdown. I can't believe it. All I had to do is just

595
02:01:10,779 --> 02:01:19,670
tackle and they broke every tackle. Why is the team risk always so high?

596
02:01:20,869 --> 02:01:29,859
Screw it. Ball carrier gets a clash icon for every 30 yards gained in a play.

597
02:01:31,640 --> 02:01:35,270
That's actually kind of insane. I don't give a shit. Send me to jail.

598
02:01:36,149 --> 02:02:00,489
Miami Hammerheads. They're a good team too. Same record. That was such a hard one to swallow.

599
02:02:00,489 --> 02:02:04,939
It's all right. I'm still one of the best teams in the league. Miami Hammerheads. Let's

600
02:02:04,939 --> 02:02:10,380
go. The Hammerheads used to be a team going nowhere. Now they're on everyone's radar. Their

601
02:02:10,460 --> 02:02:17,159
fortunes change when they move from Orlando to Miami and the biggest salary in the league

602
02:02:17,159 --> 02:02:21,989
and his precision guided attack is worth that. He's so expensive they can't afford

603
02:02:21,989 --> 02:02:26,630
to repair the hurricane damage to the stadium. Why are they dropping? When he's not bombing

604
02:02:26,630 --> 02:02:34,010
defenses through the air, he's burning them up. Look at the stadium. He's too much money.

605
02:02:34,729 --> 02:02:46,149
So they can't repair the stadium. That's really fucking ridiculous. The stadium is

606
02:02:46,229 --> 02:02:49,109
in complete disarray and they don't have the money to repair it.

607
02:02:59,670 --> 02:03:10,300
Bad in the trenches and they have a good spread offense. Good evening and welcome.

608
02:03:10,300 --> 02:03:17,479
Gotta hold Williams down to 200 yards. Good luck. It's all right. We're in the home game.

609
02:03:21,399 --> 02:03:27,210
Started off good. That's a good fucking way to start it I would say. With a touchdown.

610
02:03:27,210 --> 02:03:41,270
With a touchdown I would say. With a touchdown I would say. No. Got the half back as well.

611
02:03:42,069 --> 02:04:04,220
It's gut check time. It's all right. Asshole. Let's go with the bolt. Tight end bolt. Nice job.

612
02:04:04,939 --> 02:04:08,840
Nice job Schloser or whatever his name is. First touchdown of the game.

613
02:04:18,409 --> 02:04:25,670
We said 5,000 bits just came in. 50 bucks from La Cranda. Thank you La Cranda for the 50,

614
02:04:26,470 --> 02:04:34,279
5, 0, 0, 0, 5,000 bits. And you say, what do you say? Let's see. Hey Jeremy,

615
02:04:34,279 --> 02:04:37,319
it's clear what you have to do. Just run the ball all the way to the right and get

616
02:04:37,319 --> 02:04:42,970
a touchdown. It's just that easy. You mean like this guy's doing right now.

617
02:04:42,970 --> 02:04:51,020
Except he's going left. Thank you so much La Cranda. It's a lot of money.

618
02:04:51,659 --> 02:04:55,239
And I already got an unleashed. Let's see if we can get a fumble right now.

619
02:04:55,239 --> 02:05:01,000
Let's just go with the all out blitz. We're talking like literal all out just blitz.

620
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:12,680
Everybody on the team. Get everyone over here. Choke slam. Oh that was really cool.

621
02:05:12,680 --> 02:05:21,420
Like I didn't drop it. They got a long way to go. Let's just do some

622
02:05:22,220 --> 02:05:29,619
kind of a waste of a little unleash unfortunately. What are you throwing?

623
02:05:31,619 --> 02:05:36,619
Asshole. I didn't have a meter. I burnt the meter.

624
02:05:44,020 --> 02:05:51,350
What the hell were you doing? I got absolutely, I got a second and goal.

625
02:05:51,989 --> 02:06:01,720
No meter at all. I'm going to get a dirty hit. I thought he was going to throw it.

626
02:06:01,720 --> 02:06:21,060
I was waiting for it. Let's uh bomb edge it. Nothing. Fourth down. Good luck.

627
02:06:21,060 --> 02:06:26,840
Get a field goal dude. Hold them to a field goal. I'll be happy.

628
02:06:42,939 --> 02:06:44,460
These super bowlers sure are good.

629
02:06:47,579 --> 02:06:54,819
What are they chanting? Are they saying Yankees suck?

630
02:06:55,619 --> 02:07:13,500
Why would they be doing that? Who's injured? Shoulder dislocation.

631
02:07:13,500 --> 02:07:36,260
Oh, slippery hands. Slippery. He's gone. It's all right. Slippery fucking fingers. It's okay.

632
02:07:36,260 --> 02:07:44,329
It's like quadruple coverage. He's still gone.

633
02:07:47,930 --> 02:07:50,869
Let's do a run this way with the halfback.

634
02:07:51,510 --> 02:08:15,770
I juked that one. Minecraft Steve. It is kind of Minecraft Steve.

635
02:08:19,130 --> 02:08:26,460
Yeah that was a good, that was a good play. See this is why we need Sullivan.

636
02:08:27,180 --> 02:08:31,659
Because if that was Baxter, he probably would have fallen down.

637
02:08:33,909 --> 02:08:47,800
Baxter doesn't make that play. We don't get that touchdown. Fumble. Yep.

638
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:55,939
Oh this is good. Did I max bet? I don't think I max bet. Did I?

639
02:09:04,899 --> 02:09:15,140
Touchdown. Just right up the middle. Just jump over the edge.

640
02:09:23,640 --> 02:09:24,840
Did I bet though? I don't remember.

641
02:09:25,560 --> 02:09:46,409
I didn't bet at all. Oh well. Don't get comfortable though. This team is really good.

642
02:09:47,050 --> 02:09:51,880
It's like the only other four-in-one team in the league.

643
02:10:00,920 --> 02:10:23,529
See you. On leash is back. Good. Standard cover play. I think that sounds good for me.

644
02:10:23,529 --> 02:10:41,130
He's going to throw it. No he's not. Oh unbelievable. Unbelievable. Same thing. Do it again.

645
02:10:51,369 --> 02:11:11,609
See ya. All right. Play smart. That's all I gotta do. This will take me to the championship.

646
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:23,670
Miami sucks. But they don't. They're four-in-one just like me. Just getting good turnovers.

647
02:11:26,149 --> 02:11:29,670
And yeah we have Sullivan. It's a completely different team like somebody just said.

648
02:11:30,310 --> 02:11:35,350
This is one of the best players on the team and in the league. And they've been absent.

649
02:11:35,909 --> 02:11:46,260
If Sullivan is on the team we win by 40 points. That's just how it works.

650
02:11:49,140 --> 02:11:58,390
I'm on easy difficulty. I don't think. Is there even a difficulty slider in this game?

651
02:11:58,390 --> 02:12:02,550
I don't think there is. I haven't used it. This is just the campaign.

652
02:12:10,680 --> 02:12:30,420
Yeah it's on easy. What? There is. There is no difficulty. Easy. Turn the music on. I can't.

653
02:12:30,420 --> 02:12:36,789
The whole stream will be muted. It is just constant 100% copyright and music the whole game.

654
02:12:36,789 --> 02:12:50,199
So no one will be able to watch this vlog. That's fourth down. And they got two seconds.

655
02:12:50,199 --> 02:13:05,100
Five seconds. They're gonna. You have to go for it. Right? Yeah. Get back here. Oh!

656
02:13:10,069 --> 02:13:16,550
He's gonna make it. He made it. Oh why did I let that happen? It's because I. Punt.

657
02:13:17,750 --> 02:13:24,310
Why did I do punt return? Oh my fucking god. Punt return. Great job. Yeah it's. There's

658
02:13:24,310 --> 02:13:39,000
like five seconds fucking left. And so at halftime Las Vegas leads by 17.

659
02:13:40,039 --> 02:13:48,090
It's okay. Fuck me. Why do I always let the most bogus shit happen?

660
02:13:50,550 --> 02:13:54,899
With five seconds left I'm gonna run the whole field. Just fucking kill this guy.

661
02:13:55,539 --> 02:14:16,039
First down 30 yards to go. Sheep pass and it's caught at the three and they bring him down.

662
02:14:16,039 --> 02:14:23,899
Like I will beat this guy in a football match. But you give somebody a chance to like

663
02:14:23,899 --> 02:14:28,939
fucking throw up down the field and like run by everybody with two seconds left it'll happen every

664
02:14:28,939 --> 02:14:47,770
time. It was like fucking quadruple cover. Nobody got that. I don't have a meter either.

665
02:14:47,770 --> 02:14:50,569
All right. That's why I said it can't get comfortable to four in one team. Let's go.

666
02:14:51,689 --> 02:15:12,279
Can't get comfy. Play smart. See? Just playing. Don't go in for anything crazy.

667
02:15:21,979 --> 02:15:34,250
Fucking murdering. I'm trying to play smart. I'm trying to build meter. Fourth down. See?

668
02:15:34,250 --> 02:15:46,260
They didn't get shit. Now are you gonna go for it? Right now. They are. They're going for it on

669
02:15:46,260 --> 02:16:03,670
fourth down. Turnover on downs. Exactly what I needed to have happen. Let's just go with

670
02:16:03,670 --> 02:16:26,460
some short passes. NV coach. What's wrong with the Nevada coach? That was a little bit of

671
02:16:26,460 --> 02:16:31,510
game. Just a little bit. I'm gonna run it. I'm gonna get the half back situation right here.

672
02:16:31,510 --> 02:16:42,469
Float left. I got a little bit of meter. Let's go. Right up the middle. Straight through. Just

673
02:16:42,469 --> 02:17:10,809
run. QB dash. Just walk over the line. Don't want to get tackled though. All it takes

674
02:17:10,809 --> 02:17:23,020
is a broken skull and I have to delete the game. Really? All right. I gotta unleash this.

675
02:17:23,819 --> 02:17:32,340
I'm going for an actual unleash. Oh no!

676
02:17:46,440 --> 02:18:21,379
Turbo boomer activated. What does that mean? Look at me! Now I can relax. I'm up by way too

677
02:18:21,379 --> 02:18:33,000
much. Las Vegas refuses to call off the dogs as they add to their lead. Insult. Let's insult

678
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:50,979
them. 43-11. Where was this yesterday? And by yesterday I mean in the video game. I couldn't

679
02:18:50,979 --> 02:19:04,620
do anything. Couldn't get a fumble. Couldn't get a turnover. Good thing there's no injury

680
02:19:04,620 --> 02:19:13,100
there. What difficulty am I playing on? There is no difficulty. I don't know. Normal? Regular?

681
02:19:22,340 --> 02:19:32,459
Watch this. I just want everyone to be aware of this. One, two, three, four people here. And he

682
02:19:32,459 --> 02:20:03,620
we synchronized swam and he caught the ball. Punch somebody. Swam? A word? Yeah. Swam. I swam

683
02:20:03,620 --> 02:20:21,590
there. You didn't. You swam. That's word. I swam. I swam. I swam. I swam. What is it? Swan?

684
02:20:22,840 --> 02:20:36,040
I swam. I swam there. No it's not swum. It's swam. Swimmed? Now you're just fucking around.

685
02:20:36,680 --> 02:21:08,170
Okay. No. I got. Let's burn the clock. He's now over the 100 yard mark. Swimmed. Swum.

686
02:21:09,370 --> 02:21:24,280
Anybody that joins the stream right now and looks at chat are probably going to be like,

687
02:21:25,239 --> 02:21:28,309
is this like a funny in-joke that this guy has in the stream?

688
02:21:44,729 --> 02:21:48,200
Injury. Nope.

689
02:21:54,920 --> 02:21:56,969
That's a pretty good point.

690
02:22:00,489 --> 02:22:06,250
It's pretty much what we just heard. Smart announcer.

691
02:22:06,889 --> 02:22:24,440
Okay. John Fadden is a BF. He kind of is. In a way. That's not a safety.

692
02:22:26,200 --> 02:22:35,319
All right. This is the opportunity. We're going to hurt someone. Just go full. I don't

693
02:22:35,319 --> 02:22:39,879
even care if they score a touchdown. Who cares? We're going to go special teams and field goal

694
02:22:39,879 --> 02:23:01,860
block. Got it. That's it. I'll take the ball. Well that's a good

695
02:23:01,860 --> 02:23:10,950
achievement for that somehow. Oh well. 45-17. I'll take the win. Now we qualify for the division

696
02:23:10,950 --> 02:23:22,139
two championship. Moving on to the championship game. I don't think he got 200 yards did he?

697
02:23:22,860 --> 02:23:41,559
Should have wagered. Safety dance. New trophy. Half of the second Super Bowl.

698
02:23:42,360 --> 02:23:47,350
Division two Super Bowl. Well not yet. There's still one more game in the division.

699
02:23:54,280 --> 02:23:58,920
If you want I can arrange to have them party with ace's captain Amos Newell.

700
02:23:58,920 --> 02:24:03,000
Maybe wear him out before the game. It's going to cost but you know I got it.

701
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:12,760
Just let me know. Sabotaging the other team? Yeah. I think so. That's a good idea. Do it.

702
02:24:12,840 --> 02:24:32,870
National ad campaign. So what does that mean? Play next game at Las Vegas Aces.

703
02:24:36,870 --> 02:24:48,780
So with the Las Vegas Aces versus the Las Vegas Super Bowls. Who's the real Vegas team?

704
02:24:48,780 --> 02:24:57,020
I was going to name my team the Las Vegas Aces. You remember? It was going to be the Las Vegas

705
02:24:57,020 --> 02:25:04,780
Aces versus the Las Vegas Aces. That's too bad. So we'll find out who the best team in Vegas is.

706
02:25:06,299 --> 02:25:27,879
But first. Okay let's go to upgrades. Agility. Get everything to two. Agility. Juicing. Mr.

707
02:25:27,879 --> 02:25:34,200
Super Bowl. We're going to give you something good. Successful clash moves drain clash from

708
02:25:34,280 --> 02:25:39,450
opponent's clash bar. That's pretty good. Regenerate two stamina each player on the

709
02:25:39,450 --> 02:25:49,620
field. He's on every play. Let's give Sullivan something. Turbobar drains 50% slower. Yeah I

710
02:25:49,620 --> 02:26:10,680
think so. Somebody on defense too. J. Cruz. Give you something easy. Training is fine.

711
02:26:10,680 --> 02:26:17,260
Everything looks all right. All right. Here we go. Las Vegas Aces versus the Las Vegas

712
02:26:17,260 --> 02:26:28,920
Super Bowls. Good luck. They're not a bad team. I do have to max bet on the Las Vegas

713
02:26:28,920 --> 02:26:34,899
game though. Why wouldn't I do that? Five and one. Three and three. They're not a bad team.

714
02:26:35,700 --> 02:27:03,620
Let's go. Las Vegas Aces and the new home of Amos Newell. Linebacker. Okay. Where are we

715
02:27:03,620 --> 02:27:18,500
playing? We playing in my Vegas stadium or their Vegas stadium? Both at the same time.

716
02:27:19,219 --> 02:27:35,770
You share one. That's a cool logo. Good evening and welcome. Take a look at that crowd.

717
02:27:37,020 --> 02:27:45,239
You can see who they really support in that audience. We're on their home turf and they are

718
02:27:45,239 --> 02:27:52,100
wearing my colors. Look at that. People's champion is right here. Absolutely. That's not

719
02:27:52,100 --> 02:28:13,719
good. That's a fumble. No it's not. If it's Las Vegas versus Las Vegas who is it in a way

720
02:28:13,719 --> 02:28:33,850
game for? First and 30. I don't know. Apparently me. Damn it. Fumble out of bounds. All right.

721
02:28:33,850 --> 02:28:37,370
Take it seriously. This is a good team. Even though I already clinched the playoffs. It's

722
02:28:37,370 --> 02:29:04,620
fine. No balance. Balance deep. Third and seven. How much time are you going to give them?

723
02:29:05,739 --> 02:29:29,909
Oh boy. Bullshit. Let's do a trick play here. Maniac. I couldn't get rid of it. He's

724
02:29:29,909 --> 02:29:56,170
going in a circle. I tricked myself. Third and 33 is long. Holy fucking triangle.

725
02:29:56,969 --> 02:30:17,780
See you later. Sullivan's got it. Touchdown. He extended that reception all the way into

726
02:30:17,780 --> 02:30:21,139
the end zone. Nice yards after the catch. This is the last game of the season.

727
02:30:23,989 --> 02:30:26,629
This is just a fun game because it doesn't matter if I win or lose.

728
02:30:28,069 --> 02:30:39,100
I already clinched the playoffs. That would have been embarrassing. It's all good.

729
02:30:43,530 --> 02:31:03,479
$25,000 bet. I needed to win by, what was it? 17? 18? Let's go for the head. Drop of the ball.

730
02:31:04,600 --> 02:31:19,030
Wide receiver. That's pretty good. This is the championship. What is this though?

731
02:31:19,030 --> 02:31:41,319
This might be the local championship. It's Vegas Vegas. I couldn't go anywhere.

732
02:31:41,319 --> 02:32:03,639
It's the Vegas bowl. Two Vegas teams in the same division. Hold them here. Should be able

733
02:32:03,639 --> 02:32:12,180
to do it. That was a trick play. Franchise performs 30 or more dirty hits. What was that?

734
02:32:12,739 --> 02:32:19,420
I didn't see what that said. And that's the end of the first quarter as Las Vegas leads by seven.

735
02:32:22,649 --> 02:32:46,950
But which Las Vegas? Fourth and 16. They're gonna punt it. I gotta stop jumping. If you

736
02:32:46,950 --> 02:32:51,510
jump in the area and get tackled, you have a much higher percentage chance to get hurt

737
02:32:51,510 --> 02:32:59,770
or drop the ball. And though it does work sometimes. You've seen me jump over tackles

738
02:32:59,770 --> 02:33:35,530
before. Who is it? Drop it. Give me this back. That sucks. Broken humors. Here we go again.

739
02:33:36,250 --> 02:33:42,069
I get the ball at the half. So they do all these weird. What the fuck was that?

740
02:33:43,479 --> 02:34:06,200
Why did he just fall on his back? Whatever. I got meter. I'll probably use it.

741
02:34:06,200 --> 02:34:33,049
Goodbye. Quarterback is gone. Two plays. What have I happened to like the skull contusions?

742
02:34:47,530 --> 02:34:53,850
Second pick off. Really? Is this a wrestling game? It's whatever you want it to be.

743
02:34:54,649 --> 02:35:04,860
You have to stop aiming for their ass. It's just so easy to do that though.

744
02:35:09,450 --> 02:35:27,260
Fuck it. Let's go. Thought I could push him. Cut across. God damn it.

745
02:35:28,860 --> 02:35:35,639
I get the ball in 13 seconds. So here's what we're gonna do.

746
02:35:55,049 --> 02:35:58,809
I could have kicked the field but I wanted to. Look this game doesn't matter. I can just do

747
02:35:58,809 --> 02:36:23,159
whatever I want. That's a touchdown. Thanks. Okay we're good. 86 yard return. Let's just get in

748
02:36:23,159 --> 02:36:50,229
their red zone. Power wide. Another leash. I'm just gonna kick the field goal. I did bet too

749
02:36:50,229 --> 02:37:07,530
right? I did a max bet. We gotta get that money. Let Baxter play. Can you even do

750
02:37:07,530 --> 02:37:14,500
substitutions in this game? I don't think you can. If I go up by 30 points then he'll come in.

751
02:37:24,629 --> 02:37:36,659
Cooler guy. Out for one play. This guy is made out of clay. That's it he's back.

752
02:37:40,500 --> 02:37:59,670
Welcome back. Zack. No there he is. No he had a concussion already didn't he?

753
02:38:00,389 --> 02:38:23,850
I'm so confused. Oh and his throwing arm too. Two three plays. I'm making a lot of good

754
02:38:23,850 --> 02:38:43,750
injury plays and they're not really doing very much. Whoops a daisy. This is my opportunity to

755
02:38:43,750 --> 02:38:58,379
get the money. I hate when that happens. It's so stupid. Seriously when it bounces off the

756
02:38:58,379 --> 02:39:40,069
fucking ground. I need to win by 17 points. Who was it? Broken ribs. Oh Mims is good.

757
02:39:45,690 --> 02:40:07,659
Two plays good. Out for 200 games. Get in there. I think I'm going for a QB.

758
02:40:08,299 --> 02:40:11,909
First and goal. It's gut check. Walk across the line. Three two one go.

759
02:40:15,290 --> 02:40:44,680
Seriously. Do it again. Three two one go. Las Vegas widens the gap. Somebody just wrote stop.

760
02:40:56,840 --> 02:41:06,979
Another unleash meter and I'm up by 17. Triangle square x circle.

761
02:41:08,309 --> 02:41:11,030
I don't think any of the other codes work because I have to unlock them.

762
02:41:12,819 --> 02:41:27,479
Right in his neck. His chest. What is this going to be? Four games.

763
02:41:29,209 --> 02:41:37,340
Zynar. Las Vegas needs to do something here to get their offense in motion.

764
02:41:38,379 --> 02:41:44,069
He's going long and it's complete at the 45 yard line.

765
02:41:46,500 --> 02:41:50,659
Saw something in the defense and jumped out of the big game. Sets them up in nice field

766
02:41:50,659 --> 02:41:57,299
position and so with three quarters gone leads by 22. Collar bones are made out of dry

767
02:41:57,299 --> 02:42:03,059
spaghetti and it might be second best chat comment of the night behind Taco Bell.

768
02:42:07,100 --> 02:42:17,909
I got baited into tackling the wrong guy. It makes the same noise too.

769
02:42:18,629 --> 02:42:22,469
If you take a handful of like angel hair pasta and crush it it'll sound like that.

770
02:42:23,190 --> 02:42:28,180
Looks like they'll have four more downs to work with. The offense is looking good.

771
02:42:28,180 --> 02:42:33,750
They're driving. It's the coach's favorite place on the field. The red zone.

772
02:42:36,489 --> 02:42:45,059
Tackleman coming one two three. I gotta get another touchdown now to get that money.

773
02:42:45,940 --> 02:42:54,969
They're going for it. Good go for it. That means nope they ain't gonna get it. So that's

774
02:42:54,969 --> 02:43:03,479
six. I need to get a field goal. And it looks like they'll try an onside kick here.

775
02:43:08,139 --> 02:43:26,840
Um why are you so bad at this game? I'm nine and two. What? No not the same guy. Holy shit.

776
02:43:28,809 --> 02:43:38,840
They just like squished me. No no. Same guy.

777
02:43:42,870 --> 02:43:47,030
They just put me in a vice and crushed my body. Thank god I picked it up so I can get

778
02:43:47,030 --> 02:43:54,120
the point. He's going for eight games. Don't stumble like that.

779
02:44:02,649 --> 02:44:08,709
28. That's plenty. Just uh just try to be who cares. Rub it in.

780
02:44:16,090 --> 02:44:42,260
That's two dead players for the Super Bowlers now. Late hit. Mims is gonna have to retire

781
02:44:42,260 --> 02:44:50,520
after this one. Yeah there's a lot of broken bones. A lot of shattered spleens unfortunately.

782
02:44:51,479 --> 02:45:00,540
Watch this. Jade's got 84. I've had it. Always go for the head every time.

783
02:45:04,200 --> 02:45:14,440
Oh that hurts. I've been knocking him up for like one to two plays this whole game.

784
02:45:15,239 --> 02:45:30,709
I love this game. The noises, the sounds, the close-ups.

785
02:45:33,190 --> 02:45:48,069
Watch this. This guy's dead. Get up. Go ahead. I was hoping for something devastating there.

786
02:45:59,030 --> 02:46:07,799
Hey that's me. Now you try to tell me in the easiest possible language here.

787
02:46:09,799 --> 02:46:32,389
How did he not go down from that? That's the worst one. What happened? Right here. Guy on

788
02:46:32,389 --> 02:47:06,700
the left. I haven't selected. Crush right into his body. No. I need one point. I need one

789
02:47:06,780 --> 02:47:20,010
point. Just get close enough. First down and 30. No not 28. Thank goodness.

790
02:47:20,809 --> 02:47:32,010
Oh every time. Good. Use your timeouts. I'm okay with that. Okay almost there.

791
02:47:33,620 --> 02:47:37,979
Who needs that when you just get a fucking touchdown right?

792
02:47:38,700 --> 02:47:52,899
Franchise finds the end zone once again.

793
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:24,020
Okay now do not let them score. Let them go. Let them run for five seconds. Larsen this

794
02:48:24,020 --> 02:48:32,780
is up to you. I want this to be over now. Shit they get one play. I'm going all the way back

795
02:48:32,780 --> 02:48:43,819
here. I'll be ready for him. Who do we even do that to? And I got the bet.

796
02:48:52,120 --> 02:49:09,100
Pretty good. That was a $25,000 bet. Time for the division two championship. New sponsor,

797
02:49:09,100 --> 02:49:26,899
the enforcer. Dura shock gloves. Cool. League MVP. How am I not the MVP?

798
02:49:31,180 --> 02:49:34,969
How many touchdowns do I have? I have like 60 touchdowns.

799
02:49:35,450 --> 02:49:47,299
I told them. Hey hold that thought. This is my boy. Franchise. One game buddy. One more

800
02:49:47,299 --> 02:49:51,940
and it's division one. The big time. You get this done and we're gonna have a license to

801
02:49:51,940 --> 02:50:02,020
print money. Okay here comes the D2 championship. Tara wants to hang out.

802
02:50:03,299 --> 02:50:06,920
Rough boy. Already fighting for a spot in division one.

803
02:50:07,639 --> 02:50:09,959
Just remember what you've got waiting for you if you make it.

804
02:50:09,959 --> 02:50:16,040
Okay. Hey Franch, can you believe it? The sponsor decided to take a pass on you and

805
02:50:16,040 --> 02:50:21,639
went with grace for their ad campaign. Don't take it too hard buddy. She's only the hottest

806
02:50:21,639 --> 02:50:26,680
athlete turned supermodel. I just hung up on him. Hey it's me. Man I gotta tell you every

807
02:50:26,680 --> 02:50:31,479
time you lay a dirty hit on some stupid SOB it's pure money and you've gotten 30 of them

808
02:50:31,479 --> 02:50:36,440
already this season. That caught the attention of our new sponsor who by the way is sending

809
02:50:36,440 --> 02:50:44,940
some sweet new gear to your team's clubhouse as we speak. Okay let's take one. Sponsor

810
02:50:44,940 --> 02:50:53,239
let's see. New gloves all right. Plus six hands. That's really really good actually.

811
02:50:57,770 --> 02:51:10,069
What's going on with the girlfriend front here? Okay injuries. Who is it? Seven. Gonna

812
02:51:10,069 --> 02:51:26,659
have to give a game crashed. Please tell me it's saved. Did you crash or are you

813
02:51:26,659 --> 02:51:43,139
just having a little slow down period here? I think it autosaves so we might have to listen

814
02:51:43,139 --> 02:51:58,309
to those phone calls again. Okay well let's reset it. Let me just let's try again.

815
02:52:02,500 --> 02:52:31,959
Maybe I clicked too fast. What does that mean? No we're good. Sort of weird but

816
02:52:31,959 --> 02:52:47,059
whatever. Is it yellow? No no it's not yellow. Odd. Hopefully it saved the game.

817
02:52:47,860 --> 02:52:59,159
Now that means it's an actual full-on crash if it's yellow. No I think it was just a disk

818
02:52:59,159 --> 02:53:08,540
read problem. Just kind of ran into itself. Let's see if that worked. That's not the correct

819
02:53:08,540 --> 02:53:33,190
image. Yeah that we definitely saw that so it should be fine. Powered by GameSpy. They

820
02:53:33,190 --> 02:53:45,079
don't exist anymore. It's been a while since they've existed. Is Jerma old enough to be

821
02:53:45,079 --> 02:53:51,770
playing this? No. All right wait a minute. Let me see. X trees. Touchdown codes. Here we go.

822
02:53:52,649 --> 02:54:04,760
How do I unlock them? Yeah I can't do any of these. These have to be unlocked. So it's

823
02:54:04,760 --> 02:54:23,399
either beer chug or ball spike knockout. Continue. Select yeah Super Bowls. Hopefully

824
02:54:23,399 --> 02:54:26,739
if we don't do the last game again. There we go. Okay good.

825
02:54:33,940 --> 02:54:42,540
Hey it's me. Man I got. Okay so I went here to the trainer to go to injuries and we had a problem.

826
02:54:42,540 --> 02:54:50,629
I want to assign staff here. There we go. Everybody for the ruptured spleen. Let's go

827
02:54:50,629 --> 02:54:59,340
to upgrades. Passing is definitely everything will be at two. If we can work from there.

828
02:54:59,340 --> 02:55:05,610
I'm gonna do probably tackle and break tackle after this. Points automatically.

829
02:55:06,489 --> 02:55:19,930
Risk is high. So just do the legal one. Let's get on some defense to uh J. Cruz.

830
02:55:20,649 --> 02:55:33,770
Let's get Sullivan some of this as well. All right so this is the this is the championship

831
02:55:33,770 --> 02:55:38,489
for with the Miami Hammerheads. I think I'll get a piss first. It's been it's been a

832
02:55:38,489 --> 02:55:44,120
bi-quarterly two hours. So it's time for me to pee one more time. I'm not like drinking

833
02:55:44,120 --> 02:57:38,780
anymore coffee so don't worry. Be right back. Championship game. What do you say?

834
02:57:44,680 --> 02:57:53,510
Oh did I beat this team last time? Overall they're a little better. Not really though.

835
02:57:53,510 --> 02:58:00,180
They have a better offense. Great Canadian Fuck Club. Thanks for five community subs

836
02:58:00,979 --> 02:58:11,979
on top of the nearly 10 that you gave earlier. Thank you so much for the super subs. That's a

837
02:58:11,979 --> 02:58:35,579
lot. I'm not betting. Let's go. D2 championship. Jeremy you may win the Super Bowl but have you

838
02:58:35,579 --> 02:58:47,719
won six? I have not. I have not won the Super Bowl that many times. Good evening ever. It's

839
02:58:47,719 --> 02:58:54,870
the Division 2 championship and we are rearing. There we go. I mean there's a lot of places I

840
02:58:54,870 --> 02:59:04,659
could be but I mean this is gonna be unbelievable. Light and a thunder and lightning storm too.

841
02:59:05,379 --> 02:59:17,620
Right off the bat. That was a good hit. When he does that John Madden impression it just

842
02:59:17,620 --> 02:59:22,120
sounds like he's about to burp the whole time he's talking. He's fighting back burps.

843
02:59:22,760 --> 02:59:32,549
It's an opportunity. Really? That was just he did a really great job there.

844
02:59:34,040 --> 02:59:46,280
Second down and about a mile. No first down. Your offense is the best part.

845
02:59:46,920 --> 02:59:50,379
I gotta play better defense. The quarterback is really good. Injure the quarterback.

846
02:59:56,729 --> 03:00:14,440
No! We're good. Who is it? 41. Dupree. It's all right. Two plays. He intercepted that play.

847
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:23,350
Not with his hands. That's right. First down. 30 yards to go. Capitalize on an

848
03:00:23,350 --> 03:00:28,629
intercepted. It's a championship game for god's sakes. Don't throw it into triple coverage.

849
03:00:29,799 --> 03:00:56,920
Oh my god. I haven't unleashed. Go for the quarterback.

850
03:01:07,930 --> 03:01:14,790
If I can get that quarterback here. I would have had it too. This is bad.

851
03:01:15,350 --> 03:01:23,270
God damn it. I would have had it too. I was a tenth of a second late on the sack. I thought I

852
03:01:23,270 --> 03:02:01,180
could get it. Interception into an interception. I picked the play. Let's go. I have to be careful

853
03:02:01,180 --> 03:02:04,860
because he has it unleashed. He could strip the ball from me right now if he really wanted to.

854
03:02:04,860 --> 03:02:17,940
Great blocking. Okay. Get it to Sullivan.

855
03:02:18,899 --> 03:02:44,459
Fuck. I can't get anything going. I'm trying to activate the

856
03:02:45,420 --> 03:02:58,100
unleashed but they keep denying it. Right over him. That should be a touchdown.

857
03:02:58,739 --> 03:03:17,420
There it is. Don't just score. Score, score, score. He landed on his keys.

858
03:03:17,420 --> 03:03:21,370
I've been caught on TV doing the most moves I'd like to have. You know,

859
03:03:21,370 --> 03:03:25,989
head fake your dance partner one way and then juke him the next and then bam.

860
03:03:25,989 --> 03:03:39,510
Yeah, I wasn't going to taunt. Sat it against him. Brand new ball game.

861
03:03:39,510 --> 03:04:01,290
How did you miss that one? Sir, honest to god. How did I miss the first one?

862
03:04:03,959 --> 03:04:07,239
How is it even, whatever. I'm fine. And I just did a goal line play.

863
03:04:08,120 --> 03:04:19,209
There it is. I got it all back. I'm getting killed though on every category.

864
03:04:24,979 --> 03:04:44,969
Second and 40. They got a long way to go. It's not far enough. Same deal. Third and 31.

865
03:04:44,969 --> 03:04:57,879
They're in field goal range though I think. There it is. Hold them to field goal.

866
03:05:00,180 --> 03:05:04,969
My computer just blue screened after that Madden joke. I'm sorry to hear that.

867
03:05:06,010 --> 03:05:12,540
By the way, I'm doing a punt return. He's gonna miss it.

868
03:05:17,579 --> 03:05:29,399
It's alright. Everything's good. I might be able to get a touchdown here if I play

869
03:05:29,399 --> 03:05:35,510
the cards right. You can't. Come on. Hammer through that.

870
03:05:47,860 --> 03:05:55,370
Looking for a first down here. That was good. Electrocute his brain.

871
03:05:55,370 --> 03:06:00,780
Get him out of the game for now. It didn't even do much for me either.

872
03:06:00,780 --> 03:06:10,680
That guy was right in front of me. Where are my blockers? Second and 18.

873
03:06:22,420 --> 03:06:32,040
Oh god. This is bad. Third down. Back spasms. You should be back in like one play.

874
03:06:32,440 --> 03:06:36,680
Four plays.

875
03:06:42,739 --> 03:07:02,760
Can I get it? Got it. That guy was just barely about to not be open. I got really lucky there.

876
03:07:08,649 --> 03:07:10,170
Unleash the scare and the shit out of me.

877
03:07:24,059 --> 03:07:28,790
Almost halftime. Yeah. Coming up. I got him. I have to score at least once here.

878
03:07:37,420 --> 03:07:56,729
Get a close enough for a field goal. It's hard to aim this.

879
03:08:04,170 --> 03:08:08,090
Fucking god damn it. It's so hard to do that with the analog.

880
03:08:08,090 --> 03:08:23,180
The analog is so sloppy. You have no idea how difficult that is to move that.

881
03:08:23,180 --> 03:08:28,219
You can't. It moves so much. Trust me when I say that. That's not easy to do that.

882
03:08:29,100 --> 03:08:42,540
No timeouts. I gotta get another fucking field goal. Another one right here. Debris.

883
03:08:44,819 --> 03:08:50,200
Miss it. Of course they can do it perfect. AI's gonna do it fucking perfect every time.

884
03:08:56,360 --> 03:08:58,040
Ah fuck. At least I get the ball.

885
03:09:11,459 --> 03:09:19,059
The AI's not blaming its controller. No aiming with a field goal. Go get this game and do it

886
03:09:19,059 --> 03:09:38,090
and we'll have a discussion about it. My defense is so good.

887
03:09:41,959 --> 03:10:00,889
Very fucking down. Get across. Bingo. Right there. Just run it in.

888
03:10:00,889 --> 03:10:07,700
We got good meter.

889
03:10:10,920 --> 03:10:15,940
Almost there. Just walk it in. You know my favorite play.

890
03:10:25,639 --> 03:10:31,540
Hey I got it. All that matters is the art.

891
03:10:51,430 --> 03:11:08,309
Yeah I crossed the plane. We crossed the plane. We're good. Meter. See if I can get a fumble.

892
03:11:09,190 --> 03:11:30,149
Where are we? Goal line. Balanced. Crush. No. Balanced. Safe to push. No dog shit.

893
03:11:30,950 --> 03:11:36,819
It's a close game. It's gonna stay that way. And that was my tackle when I was supposed to

894
03:11:36,819 --> 03:12:04,579
get him. He snuck right through and got like 10 yards. No field goal. No more game. No first

895
03:12:04,579 --> 03:12:15,190
down. Thank you very much. I'll take it. Yes. It took too long to throw it.

896
03:12:16,069 --> 03:12:23,780
Before you know it those kids are in the grind. What the hell is he talking about?

897
03:12:24,739 --> 03:12:40,840
Almost. Fourth quarter. Division two championship. I am focused. I'm alert and I'm ready.

898
03:12:46,540 --> 03:13:05,020
Second and 24. Let's try to get a quick pass over here on the left. How could you let that

899
03:13:05,020 --> 03:13:25,370
happen? Yes.

900
03:13:38,409 --> 03:13:44,489
21-13. He needs a touchdown and a two-point conversion. Or it's over. And I win the

901
03:13:45,370 --> 03:13:53,110
goddamn championship. No bullshit. No bogus plays where he runs back the whole thing.

902
03:13:53,909 --> 03:14:16,700
First down and 30. I can try to strip it. That's perfect. That's exactly what I needed right now.

903
03:14:17,420 --> 03:14:35,700
That's two interceptions. Las Vegas leads by eight. Who is that? No not Sullivan again.

904
03:14:37,590 --> 03:14:44,139
No this is the championship game. I can't lose him for like five games again. Okay don't

905
03:14:44,139 --> 03:15:00,229
blow this. He'll come back in like three plays. One play. Thank god. That would have

906
03:15:00,229 --> 03:15:04,629
been the whole game probably if I fucked that up. Nice. Can't let them catch their breath. I say

907
03:15:04,629 --> 03:15:25,459
we test the corner. Second and goal. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Going for my favorite play

908
03:15:25,459 --> 03:15:46,120
right in the middle. Just sneak it in. Third and goal. That's how you get hurt but it's okay.

909
03:15:50,760 --> 03:16:18,780
28-13. Just round the clock. They made all these sound effects with him mouth.

910
03:16:19,340 --> 03:16:34,229
That'd be actually pretty ridiculous. It'd be 31 if I made that field goal. We don't need it

911
03:16:34,229 --> 03:16:41,610
though. First down 30 yards to go. I made up for the fact that we don't need that field goal.

912
03:16:42,489 --> 03:16:59,850
Powerball. That goes to their quarterback. Brew's kidney. Out for three plays and that's

913
03:16:59,850 --> 03:17:03,610
going to be the three plays that you need the most. So you definitely lost.

914
03:17:05,049 --> 03:17:26,120
Try to do. Let's hurt this guy too. No ball explosion. We've seen it like three or four

915
03:17:26,120 --> 03:17:42,149
times tonight though. Third and short for this offense. Damn it. It's all right. Let him have

916
03:17:42,149 --> 03:18:00,020
one. And he's in the end zone. I'm just going to run the clock out and the game's going

917
03:18:00,020 --> 03:18:40,840
to end. It's the very end of the game. It's all right. Nice. What do we want to do here?

918
03:18:40,840 --> 03:18:58,819
Just run. Burn the timeouts. Oh my fucking god. It's okay. It's going to be for like

919
03:18:58,819 --> 03:19:05,030
the whole season. Seven games but there's no more games to play. Don't just injure my whole

920
03:19:05,030 --> 03:19:18,680
team and make this fucking whole thing. Oh Jesus Christ. You didn't even aim. You aimed for the

921
03:19:18,680 --> 03:19:27,139
head. That's half back half back. How many half backs do I have? Why do you guys have to share

922
03:19:27,139 --> 03:19:35,000
the same problem? Who's the half back now? Just give it to them. Who the fuck is this? Peter?

923
03:19:38,170 --> 03:19:47,159
Fuck. It's fourth down. Am I in field goal range? Am I about to fucking have a meltdown?

924
03:19:47,159 --> 03:20:08,340
All right. What was wrong with that? What was wrong with that?

925
03:20:20,700 --> 03:20:24,459
This is not good. All they need is a touchdown and they're not going to get it.

926
03:20:32,969 --> 03:20:46,459
Yes. Dead. That was Williams. That was the star quarterback.

927
03:20:47,020 --> 03:20:57,219
That should seal the deal right there. Now just play prevention. Just play smart.

928
03:21:01,049 --> 03:21:10,139
This quarterback sucks. Oh my fucking god.

929
03:21:23,770 --> 03:21:33,139
Not this time. Same deal. Just man. Just prevent. Just cover everything. Just stay out.

930
03:21:33,860 --> 03:21:36,280
Last play of the game.

931
03:21:41,190 --> 03:21:43,829
Fuck you game over. I win championship. Division two championship.

932
03:21:54,389 --> 03:22:17,319
More touchdowns. I unlocked everything. Moving on to D1. LT session. Loader. Silver.

933
03:22:21,079 --> 03:22:33,639
New touchdown code. Circle XX circle is pylon kick. Finally took long enough. It took

934
03:22:33,639 --> 03:22:37,319
six and a half hours for me to get a new one. More than that.

935
03:22:46,010 --> 03:22:48,200
Uh oh. Here comes the scumbag.

936
03:23:06,649 --> 03:23:08,729
Oh shit. Here it comes.

937
03:23:41,370 --> 03:23:43,290
The LA Riot.

938
03:23:45,719 --> 03:23:52,649
Oh wow. Is that what we just won? We just won the championship. That doesn't make any sense.

939
03:23:53,850 --> 03:23:58,920
They didn't win the championship. What's up Carl?

940
03:24:09,159 --> 03:24:09,719
Oh yes.

941
03:24:09,719 --> 03:24:18,149
Yes. Absolutely. The draft. There it is. We get to pick a new player.

942
03:24:19,110 --> 03:24:37,559
Remember this guy from prison? Right defensive end. Look at this. No this is it. I just can

943
03:24:37,559 --> 03:24:46,520
either accept him or not accept him. Look at that speed agility. I just get him. A hundred

944
03:24:46,520 --> 03:24:54,729
resist injury. He's never gonna get hurt. Yeah. I can't select anybody else right? There's no

945
03:24:54,729 --> 03:25:00,790
other options. It's just this. Let's go.

946
03:25:14,409 --> 03:25:25,610
200 plus combined yards. All right here we're in D1. Just to make sure everyone's in the right

947
03:25:25,610 --> 03:25:44,440
spot. Quarterback. That's me. Halfback got Sullivan. Ashford sure has kind of climbed

948
03:25:44,440 --> 03:25:53,930
the rankings here. A minus. A plus punter. Whenever you have to use him. Let's take a

949
03:25:53,930 --> 03:26:10,969
look. Cruz and Tirpitz. This is a pretty great team. I'm happy about it. Mexico City

950
03:26:10,969 --> 03:26:17,940
Aztecs is the next team. Let's see what I got. Plus six hands plus two speed.

951
03:26:18,899 --> 03:26:32,579
Okay I don't have enough money to do anything. I don't think so at least. No. Resist injury.

952
03:26:34,659 --> 03:26:42,170
Yeah massage therapy that's maxed out now. All right let's go.

953
03:26:50,729 --> 03:26:58,760
Well that is a create a character cheat team. Good luck. I'm not betting any money here.

954
03:27:09,049 --> 03:27:48,840
We're gonna get our asses kicked. We're gonna lose real bad. That's the spirit. This is D1.

955
03:27:49,559 --> 03:28:08,280
Tight end. I gotta win five games. And thanks for joining us. 200 plus combined yards this game.

956
03:28:12,600 --> 03:28:15,479
The heat is a factor. You see the uh the waves there.

957
03:28:24,870 --> 03:28:29,989
No he made it here on time. Corner look. First down 30 yards to go. That haze.

958
03:28:29,989 --> 03:28:45,989
26 yard line. I wonder how that affects. Heat is a factor in Mexico but not in Las Vegas.

959
03:28:46,069 --> 03:28:55,590
Yeah I'm not sure how. I'm gonna go with go with a good pass here.

960
03:28:58,120 --> 03:29:07,049
I might just sneak over. What the hell was that? Damn it. I thought I could sneak over there.

961
03:29:18,729 --> 03:29:25,819
Out of my way. The dive seems to work a lot for me.

962
03:29:26,459 --> 03:29:33,399
Cut across. Cut across. Cut across. Thank you.

963
03:29:46,940 --> 03:29:53,959
That's a beautiful juke from Sullivan. What's it? What is it? What is it? What is it? What is it?

964
03:29:53,959 --> 03:29:57,319
Wow that was fast. I think he broke the sound barrier. Well you know that's like at the

965
03:29:57,319 --> 03:30:01,239
air show where they fly by and they're already gone before the sound of them hits your ears.

966
03:30:01,239 --> 03:30:06,120
You ever see that? Well it wasn't that fast but but for not having wings or a jet engine

967
03:30:06,360 --> 03:30:30,299
What a great unlockable that was. He just kicks the pylon. Stay him. So now with their possession

968
03:30:30,940 --> 03:30:46,020
you've got to be aware of a guy who has a tight end right. He shed this guy

969
03:30:46,020 --> 03:30:51,590
nearly exactly what he's doing here. Wait no no. I just don't want to do him in the ass.

970
03:30:51,590 --> 03:31:00,540
I want to do it in the back. I would have I would have broken his spine. I tried to do it

971
03:31:00,540 --> 03:31:22,899
and it just looked out. First down and third. Number 81. Watch 81. D1 is gonna be hell.

972
03:31:33,340 --> 03:31:37,979
Miraculously still hands on. That's the end of the first quarter as Las Vegas leads by seven.

973
03:31:43,850 --> 03:31:57,850
Blitz him. I see what you're doing. How the hell did you. I got tricked.

974
03:31:58,569 --> 03:32:00,409
He tricked me. I thought it was gonna be a handoff run.

975
03:32:17,899 --> 03:32:24,870
Oh that's all right. Tie game. Who kicked the ball?

976
03:32:35,340 --> 03:32:39,020
You want to get tricked? Fine. I'm gonna do a snowflake. I don't even know what this does.

977
03:32:42,280 --> 03:32:51,290
Um I didn't even do that. He ran to the left on his own.

978
03:32:53,780 --> 03:33:00,010
Oh this sucks.

979
03:33:10,200 --> 03:33:12,280
I blame snowflake. That's what I blame for real.

980
03:33:18,139 --> 03:33:24,780
And how. Excuse me gentlemen. How do you not catch that? It was right to you. It was right

981
03:33:24,780 --> 03:33:36,040
to you. I blocked 81. I took him out and the ball was thrown right to your hands. Fumble.

982
03:33:37,430 --> 03:33:37,909
Thank you.

983
03:33:54,700 --> 03:34:06,309
Let's try it wrong. First and 30. That's not good. Oh that's not good.

984
03:34:07,030 --> 03:34:17,379
Sullivan again. Beru's kidney. Get a good injection. He should be fine in about three plays.

985
03:34:19,059 --> 03:34:20,979
I don't want to hurt you with this needle. Good enough.

986
03:34:21,940 --> 03:34:29,239
Oh hey hey. Why aren't they showing the announcer's face?

987
03:34:30,379 --> 03:34:43,540
They're all over. Probably extra money. Second to 25. Yes. Oh first down.

988
03:34:43,540 --> 03:34:48,340
Las Vegas had everyone on the same page there and they are rewarded with a very nice game.

989
03:34:50,709 --> 03:34:54,950
The offense is going to get the ball and he's going to get off. He's going to get his

990
03:34:56,549 --> 03:34:58,149
t-bone shattered. Whatever the hell that is.

991
03:34:58,149 --> 03:35:10,340
So we've managed to run for like uh hmm. Dragon downfield player. Good. You good to go?

992
03:35:12,379 --> 03:35:22,229
With under a minute to play in the half we're all tied up. Is it third and 15?

993
03:35:23,030 --> 03:35:28,469
Whoa is it possible we're making progress? While we're at it let's try scoring.

994
03:35:29,590 --> 03:35:31,819
Gotta make something happen.

995
03:35:32,139 --> 03:35:37,180
And it's incomplete.

996
03:35:43,270 --> 03:35:51,829
Fuck it. It's goddamn division one. You gotta make plays. Exactly what I'm talking about.

997
03:36:01,639 --> 03:36:15,340
He has the same five lines. John Madden too has the same five lines. Now I know why somebody

998
03:36:15,340 --> 03:36:20,819
said can you please mute him. I was like what are they talking about? Now I get it.

999
03:36:29,959 --> 03:36:33,899
First down. Three yards to go. I'll buy a touchdown.

1000
03:36:36,739 --> 03:36:44,950
Mexico City with a nice game there thanks to some key downfield blocks.

1001
03:36:45,989 --> 03:37:00,579
Uh I blew that one. That was actually botched. Um how did you still throw it?

1002
03:37:00,579 --> 03:37:05,780
Touchdown. Mexico City. If that's me as the quarterback how do you throw that perfect throw?

1003
03:37:06,100 --> 03:37:13,750
Okay. Let's watch. So he gets fucking tackled and then underhand throws the ball perfectly

1004
03:37:13,750 --> 03:37:27,180
with the guy downfield. It is six points. I don't understand. I almost had it. The extra

1005
03:37:27,180 --> 03:37:45,479
point is good and once again we're all even. It's D1. Goddamn D1. Not gonna win that one.

1006
03:37:45,479 --> 03:37:58,620
Let's give Snowflake another chance. I'm never doing that play ever again.

1007
03:37:58,620 --> 03:38:02,299
There's a guy who's in pain from a big hit. How do you know? I don't see him crying or

1008
03:38:02,299 --> 03:38:05,739
anything but that's probably because he's crying on the inside. That's the kind of guy he is.

1009
03:38:05,739 --> 03:38:09,420
And after the game the trainers got to open him up blow dry his spleen or something like that.

1010
03:38:11,579 --> 03:38:14,219
I went the wrong way. The computer had control.

1011
03:38:18,309 --> 03:38:21,430
When he gets the ball he runs to the left. I don't have control of the game.

1012
03:38:22,899 --> 03:38:26,899
He takes control and runs left and then gets tackled by the same guy every time.

1013
03:38:29,930 --> 03:38:33,129
I have not had control of the character every time I've done that play.

1014
03:38:38,200 --> 03:38:47,610
Runs to the left and gets tackled. Always going for the guys like balls.

1015
03:39:00,520 --> 03:39:37,110
Do a balanced D I think. I saw that one coming from by the way in 26. I was waiting for you.

1016
03:39:38,469 --> 03:39:52,180
Although they're pretty close though. Third and seven. Incomplete pass. Here we go and then

1017
03:39:52,180 --> 03:40:04,040
they're gonna kick it. That was fucking brutal. That was brutal and we got the ball and it's

1018
03:40:04,040 --> 03:40:21,750
a touchdown. Has to be. Six plays. Has the best possible scenario here. I'm gonna say

1019
03:40:22,790 --> 03:40:36,250
clear. I don't even know what play it is. It's gut check time. That's stupid.

1020
03:40:41,540 --> 03:40:52,809
I really like this play. The corner look. Watch that unleashed. Here comes not 28 please.

1021
03:40:56,340 --> 03:41:07,290
Not no not Sullivan. No he's going forever. Ruptured scrotum. Five games. I need him in the

1022
03:41:07,290 --> 03:41:33,049
game right now. That's not good. This is bad. Okay it's an easy kick. Perfect right?

1023
03:41:35,350 --> 03:41:36,549
That almost didn't go through.

1024
03:41:43,319 --> 03:41:47,319
I know I'm supposed to wear them. I'm expected to wear them but something keeps telling me not

1025
03:41:47,319 --> 03:42:02,379
to trust them. Good night. Broken column. You gotta be up at least five games.

1026
03:42:08,180 --> 03:42:12,680
Got a fresh unleash. Let's kill the quarterback.

1027
03:42:13,750 --> 03:42:25,590
I'm going for it. I'm just blitzing. Fuck it. Fuck I thought I had it. Oh I thought I had

1028
03:42:25,590 --> 03:42:30,069
it. I really thought I did. If that were me out there running it would probably make people

1029
03:42:30,709 --> 03:42:36,469
I really thought it was gonna happen. Good job safety. Big series of downs upcoming.

1030
03:42:36,469 --> 03:42:39,909
I thought I had it. That was a given. It was a given that I was gonna get that.

1031
03:42:48,299 --> 03:42:56,569
It's beautiful. I don't got a good halfback.

1032
03:42:59,659 --> 03:43:14,579
First down and 30. Kane you fucking idiot. I was about to say that was great but it

1033
03:43:14,579 --> 03:43:17,780
wasn't. It was awful. It was just awful.

1034
03:43:33,000 --> 03:43:36,120
I'm so mad about that fumble because that was the turnaround of the game right there.

1035
03:43:51,340 --> 03:43:55,100
This isn't gonna be another one of those games or I'm gonna be down by three or four points.

1036
03:43:55,819 --> 03:43:57,020
How many times is that gonna happen?

1037
03:44:04,329 --> 03:44:09,579
Thank you. All right Dupree and that's a touchback. We'll see if their defense can hold.

1038
03:44:10,540 --> 03:44:18,280
No it's okay. That's okay. There's been a guy that's been intercepting the all game.

1039
03:44:19,239 --> 03:44:22,090
You know what fuck it. We're going with an unleash catch.

1040
03:44:26,299 --> 03:44:28,860
That's a guaranteed catch. Eat shit touchdown.

1041
03:44:34,329 --> 03:44:38,020
Las Vegas tears up a good chunk of field there and you know what I'm doing.

1042
03:44:41,860 --> 03:45:07,590
Thank god. What's worse this or beer chunk. I wonder. Everybody was so desperate to get a

1043
03:45:07,590 --> 03:45:41,370
different celebration. Now you have pylon kick. Keep giving franchise yards. Just got stuffed

1044
03:45:41,370 --> 03:45:50,520
and that would have been a touchdown. First and 30. Who the fuck is franchise? I don't

1045
03:45:50,520 --> 03:46:06,360
know who Mr. Super Bowl is. Good let him run the clock. Let him go down the field as long

1046
03:46:06,360 --> 03:46:12,729
as they want. It's impossible for them to get anymore and then I just got to not throw any

1047
03:46:12,729 --> 03:46:16,969
interceptions. Just run the ball around the clock. Game's over. First division one game complete.

1048
03:46:30,870 --> 03:46:33,989
This is fine. I don't care how many points you score right now.

1049
03:46:44,600 --> 03:46:50,120
That's a guarantee. He guaranteed it. It's fine. He used his unleash.

1050
03:46:51,079 --> 03:46:53,639
Doesn't matter how many points he gets. I have a ball.

1051
03:46:54,360 --> 03:47:07,020
How long is this gonna be? It is 20 at best. Yeah see the 44 seconds just run every play.

1052
03:47:10,680 --> 03:47:14,200
Don't do anything. No unleash. Don't do anything stupid. Run the ball.

1053
03:47:15,159 --> 03:47:17,559
And it looks like they'll try an onside kick here.

1054
03:47:23,159 --> 03:47:28,709
Easy. There's my halfback in the game. Okay no incompletions. Keep it between the

1055
03:47:28,709 --> 03:47:35,850
lines and keep the clock running. Easy right? Yeah that's what I said. First down. All right

1056
03:47:35,850 --> 03:47:44,069
Cox you have to really pull through here. Take the time out. And then you got your can't get

1057
03:47:44,069 --> 03:47:47,829
a date to the problem. You have one more time out. What do you think about it? I'm not the

1058
03:47:47,829 --> 03:47:51,750
best looking corsage on the lapel. So in a way you think about it it's kind of beautiful

1059
03:47:51,750 --> 03:47:56,790
or at least it's the kind of ugly only a mother could find. Does that make sense?

1060
03:47:56,790 --> 03:48:03,030
That's fine. You don't know about the damage till days or weeks later you just sit there

1061
03:48:03,030 --> 03:48:08,309
eating lunch all of a sudden you just start screaming. Third and now let's just call it third

1062
03:48:08,309 --> 03:48:21,290
in a ways. Why did where's he running? Oh excuse me. Excuse me. I did not do that.

1063
03:48:23,829 --> 03:48:30,969
He just started running. Why the fuck did you do that? Oh shit.

1064
03:48:42,219 --> 03:49:01,030
You got to be kidding me. I'm panicking. Guys they don't have any time outs. I'm about to have

1065
03:49:01,030 --> 03:49:06,250
an unleashed. All right there's no reason why they get the ball to the hands-off with an

1066
03:49:06,250 --> 03:49:12,629
unleashed. Not a single reason with me with an unleashed full meter. You don't have any more

1067
03:49:12,629 --> 03:49:21,530
time outs. The person that gets the ball is dead. Un-fucking-belief. They don't have any

1068
03:49:21,530 --> 03:49:27,209
time. It's over. Good luck. I don't know what play I'm gonna pick. Maybe I should pick.

1069
03:49:27,930 --> 03:49:34,180
Oh wait what? First down 30 yards to go. This is their last play.

1070
03:49:43,079 --> 03:49:58,139
Fuck you. That was so close. I was so scared. I had to wait to the last second because he

1071
03:49:58,139 --> 03:50:07,399
was doing a clash catch. That would have been so disappointing. But that's the first

1072
03:50:07,399 --> 03:50:23,420
game in division one complete. I only have $290,000. That's not good. Pronghorn gear

1073
03:50:24,219 --> 03:50:30,940
unlocked. Yeah that was just the first one. I have to win four more games

1074
03:50:31,579 --> 03:50:34,379
and then I get to go to the absolute complete championship.

1075
03:50:36,969 --> 03:50:41,370
franchise this is grace i hope you don't mind me being forward but seeing as we're working

1076
03:50:41,370 --> 03:50:45,610

accidents happen even the league captains so i've heard i'd be especially grateful

1083
03:51:22,790 --> 03:51:32,540

1112
03:57:23,370 --> 03:57:43,739
again and they draw even with that score gives this team a new set of downs i'm going to kick

1115
03:58:13,700 --> 03:58:25,770

1118
03:58:41,370 --> 03:58:50,739
got that good job happy 56 birthday keep it going keep it going they've given themselves

1119
03:58:50,739 --> 03:59:01,899
a great opportunity here in the red zone if the ball would have gotten to the defender

1120
03:59:01,899 --> 03:59:07,420
come on man we're gonna do this all day let's get up man let's cut this left corner

1121
03:59:16,389 --> 03:59:38,899
all right you know what i'm doing it works every time six more points let's take a two

1122
03:59:38,899 --> 03:59:48,219
on one division why do americans like this stupid sport i don't know why does anybody like

1123
03:59:48,219 --> 04:00:15,510
any sport a lot of people like golf a lot of people like to fish you know unleash i'd rather

1124
04:00:15,510 --> 04:00:22,219
watch wii bowling well you're about to watch somebody beat the championship and get to the

1125
04:00:22,219 --> 04:00:32,889
super bowl and win it's not the way incomplete that's too bad the offense has a ways to go

1126
04:00:32,889 --> 04:00:40,170
here on second down i tried to turn around and catch it injury there's the injury i was

1127
04:00:40,170 --> 04:01:00,969
looking for that get man that's a new sponsor stay down there goes your star player good

1128
04:01:01,930 --> 04:01:03,659
now i can relax a little

1129
04:01:14,840 --> 04:01:26,709
the backup is better that'd be really odd we need to stop them right here right now

1130
04:01:32,100 --> 04:01:35,940
i just assume they go for it because i go for it 75 percent of the time

1131
04:01:37,139 --> 04:01:53,340
what are these colors for are they're supposed to be my colors like my channel colors

1132
04:01:54,299 --> 04:01:56,489
somehow

1133
04:01:59,059 --> 04:02:04,420
who gets the ball

1134
04:02:15,879 --> 04:02:17,000
you're not going to get away with this

1135
04:02:38,100 --> 04:02:45,079
all right unleash a lot of the good starting players are gone so that's good

1136
04:02:45,879 --> 04:03:07,579
i'm up on third down right third and 22 third down and long gets near i don't think

1137
04:03:07,579 --> 04:03:15,319

1138

1139
04:03:24,549 --> 04:03:44,149
people touched that he was bouncing around on everybody i got one more play here to try

1140
04:03:44,629 --> 04:03:51,459
should i just get a field goal or should i go for it field goal be safe safe field goal

1141
04:03:53,909 --> 04:04:04,069
now fuck it we're going for it first and goal it's gut check time end zone

1142
04:04:05,989 --> 04:04:12,250
should have just got a fucking field goal and so at halftime los vegas leads by seven

1143
04:04:16,760 --> 04:04:20,840
somebody fucking called me a bus so i had to do it i looked over and was like oh you

1144
04:04:20,840 --> 04:04:32,219

1145
04:04:39,860 --> 04:04:51,290
first down 30 yards to go

1146
04:04:52,819 --> 04:05:09,829
defense could taste that oh that was outrageous that was a trick play it was so tricky nobody

1147
04:05:09,829 --> 04:05:26,090
knew what the fuck happened new set of downs you already know what i'm doing defense backed

1148
04:05:26,090 --> 04:06:00,659
up to their own goal line franchise brings the dinner bell again 27 good beer chug to nose

1149
04:06:01,620 --> 04:06:06,219
i would say of all the mistakes in my life and there have been a couple you know eating

1150
04:06:06,219 --> 04:06:10,219
bananas with jalapenos makes is one of the biggest and a girl in san diego

1151
04:06:13,180 --> 04:06:14,700
apparently that's a mistake somehow

1152
04:06:23,079 --> 04:06:29,290
that's how you do john men he does the talk with a kind of a high voice at first

1153
04:06:30,389 --> 04:06:33,270
oh my fucking god i'm talking and that's why i fucked it up

1154
04:06:33,430 --> 04:06:40,100
and i need focus they are rewarded with a very nice game first and goal it's gut check time

1155
04:06:40,100 --> 04:06:48,149
ball up the 22 yard line never had a chance he got

1156
04:06:53,030 --> 04:07:14,280
reversal that's fine that doesn't sound like madden at all

1157
04:07:15,479 --> 04:07:20,870
it does if you tried to take a guess who that was who would you say that was

1158
04:07:22,200 --> 04:07:29,770
okay ready who am i if you never heard that

1159
04:07:40,860 --> 04:08:08,219

1161
04:08:28,200 --> 04:08:38,389
it's all right i was in a bad run holy good thing he's got insurance

1162
04:08:50,360 --> 04:08:58,489
los vegas gets it back and so with three quarters gone

1163
04:08:58,489 --> 04:09:03,770
los vegas leads by seven i'm pretty convinced that the trick plays are only in the game

1164
04:09:03,850 --> 04:09:05,370
for when you play against another human

1165
04:09:06,969 --> 04:09:13,270
friend of yours seems like a hell of a lot more than eight that's not it doesn't fool the computer

1166
04:09:30,940 --> 04:09:35,670
i have to go for a clash catch here even if it's turnover

1167
04:09:35,909 --> 04:09:36,309
i don't care

1168
04:09:42,950 --> 04:10:07,479
that was really really important it helps me seal it you know that they're an awful

1169
04:10:07,479 --> 04:10:28,299

1170
04:10:28,299 --> 04:10:40,889

1174
04:11:20,860 --> 04:11:31,770
of the game in like the first quarter what are you gonna do on fourth down a minute to go

1175
04:11:31,770 --> 04:11:37,049
you're definitely going to go for it safety blitz

1176
04:11:40,809 --> 04:11:44,729
seven yard line and he's brought down and they turn the ball over now they could have

1177
04:11:44,729 --> 04:11:49,610
used some points right there franchise didn't franchise dude no way big stop there

1178
04:11:50,729 --> 04:11:53,610

1204
04:17:35,260 --> 04:17:41,180
with a passing game it's hard to stop my receiver tito moss is their number one barebone

1205
04:17:41,180 --> 04:17:46,700
threat little shit's been in the league 10 years now and he's just as quick and just as

1206
04:17:46,700 --> 04:17:54,489
dirty fortunately for us their defense can't stop anybody or we'd be screwed terrible defense

1207
04:17:54,969 --> 04:18:11,739
good wish i had the best halfback in the league he just did the look of me did he

1209
04:18:41,500 --> 04:18:52,940
every game we've played tonight only lost once i don't know why i just said that considering

1210
04:18:53,739 --> 04:19:06,219
i'm gonna jinx it bad yard knock on wood right yeah

1211
04:19:09,500 --> 04:19:22,860
all right cox uh-oh i thought the defense was supposed to suck

1212
04:19:23,899 --> 04:19:26,059
the defense will be coming here on third long

1213
04:19:31,370 --> 04:19:38,149
he sure didn't try to be nice thought i could throw it still fuck it let's go

1214
04:19:39,030 --> 04:20:01,500
this is what bill balachek would do let's go that's not good

1215
04:20:02,379 --> 04:20:09,750
keeper gets taken out before the ball gets near him i don't think he knows what hit him

1216
04:20:16,760 --> 04:20:26,280
really thought i caught him on the bond literally not what bill balachek would do on the first

1217
04:20:26,280 --> 04:20:48,340
possession i would have had it too i've got to cover this guy thank you very much

1218
04:20:49,139 --> 04:21:01,020
get out of the end zone all right what would bill balachek do right now

1219
04:21:01,819 --> 04:21:07,079
you can kick a field goal no don't make a fucking shitty joke let's go

1220
04:21:09,879 --> 04:21:14,340
first down and 30 ball at the six yards where

1221
04:21:15,620 --> 04:21:26,100
los vegas really executed on that play and took a big step down the field nice work

1222
04:21:33,180 --> 04:21:43,049
franchise demonstrating why he's considered one of the all right 24 yards i'll take it

1223
04:21:44,329 --> 04:21:59,020
again do it again they have uh oh they have an unleash okay i'll take the hit that's the end

1224
04:21:59,020 --> 04:22:05,850
of the first quarter as we're scoreless is your planning on finishing the game story

1225
04:22:06,569 --> 04:22:17,319
we're pretty close we're at i mean there's only three games left in the division i can't

1226
04:22:17,319 --> 04:22:26,860
now run out of bounds he did a great job of finding the hole and bursting through first

1227
04:22:26,860 --> 04:22:44,010
and goal it's gut check time ball at the three yard line so got it you think someone

1228
04:22:44,010 --> 04:22:47,930
would have a playbook on me right now every time he gets to within five yards of the end

1229
04:22:47,930 --> 04:22:52,969
zone he jumps with the quarterback that was pretty somebody tell me why we can't do that

1230
04:22:52,969 --> 04:23:20,020
in every position it always works every time what is good oops easy no injury here

1231
04:23:20,659 --> 04:23:31,639
i will build up points though do another p break i don't have to be yet it hasn't been a

1232
04:23:32,360 --> 04:23:39,510
quarterly first and 30 it's only been what like an hour usually p three to four times

1233
04:23:44,459 --> 04:23:45,979
that's the guy that catches every ball

1234
04:23:52,969 --> 04:24:08,280
i p like every two hours injury he's getting weak p right now do it right now i'm in the

1235
04:24:08,280 --> 04:24:32,309
middle of a game i'm in the middle of a game heard him just comes easy to this guy

1236
04:24:32,309 --> 04:24:37,030
sure he works hard he has talent but that's what makes these sorts of plays so easy for

1237
04:24:37,030 --> 04:24:40,950
bravo it's the coach's favorite place on the field the red zone

1238
04:24:42,709 --> 04:24:52,629
end zone yes yes three and own division one let's go let's do it

1239
04:24:54,069 --> 04:25:08,780
first down yards to go intercepted didn't i just fucking upgrade hands is there a reason why

1240
04:25:08,780 --> 04:25:15,209
it's bouncing out of every but it's it has bounced 50 of every pass i've thrown this game

1241
04:25:15,770 --> 04:25:23,129
big series of downs upcoming we just got hands to level three is something wrong with you

1242
04:25:24,250 --> 04:25:48,920
that's my passing two just deflate the ball i'm going for it down and goal to go don't let him do

1243
04:25:48,920 --> 04:26:01,209
the thing that i do damn it the way he put that ball on target come on block this you've done

1244
04:26:01,209 --> 04:26:16,760
it like three times and so we're tied who gets the ball i never i don't even remember

1245
04:26:17,559 --> 04:26:44,709
i think they do i think they get the ball it's getting a little hairy here okay triple coverage

1246
04:26:44,709 --> 04:26:58,219
to him oh why do i continue to do this that's not gonna matter they're not gonna get it's

1247
04:26:58,219 --> 04:27:11,639
gonna be fine they're not gonna get it you can pretend all you want just kick it off again

1248
04:27:12,280 --> 04:27:18,440
and so at halftime we're tied what do i have for dinner today i had pork chop

1249
04:27:18,440 --> 04:27:38,739
it's pretty good it was delicious hold them here they're gonna have an unleash in about

1250
04:27:38,739 --> 04:28:05,340
30 seconds i don't want to have to play ketchup to stop smash out for the whole game

1251
04:28:09,260 --> 04:28:24,229
yeah pork chop and a little bit of couscous it was great don't hold on wait

1252
04:28:27,059 --> 04:28:36,409
you youngsters out there what the run after the catch is important the first thing you have to do

1253
04:28:36,409 --> 04:28:42,219
is catch the ball and secure it he showed you how to do it right there for all you youngsters

1254
04:28:44,139 --> 04:28:50,420
they didn't really get that much yardage either they didn't get a first down

1255
04:28:51,459 --> 04:28:56,409
that is here but don't let them get a touchdown they get they get they get

1256
04:28:56,409 --> 04:29:00,409
yes yes yes they don't have anything they don't need to clash what a fucking blunder

1257
04:29:00,409 --> 04:29:21,270
that i didn't capitalize on yes i did fumble it again there he goes six games goodbye always

1258
04:29:21,270 --> 04:29:24,950
go for the water balloon yeah put some if you bust this spleen they're always out for at least

1259
04:29:24,950 --> 04:29:34,569
three full games it's the best thing that could have happened good yes it is the defender was

1260
04:29:34,569 --> 04:29:38,809
in the right place at the right time it was able to snag his second interception of the

1261
04:29:38,809 --> 04:29:40,809
game first down 30 yards to go

1262
04:30:04,860 --> 04:30:22,020
that almost ready two more chug yeah he's doing the chug again i wish he would do

1263
04:30:22,020 --> 04:30:34,790
anything else but chug one more no two more dirty hits and

1264
04:30:38,229 --> 04:31:06,040
i'm gonna strip that ball run it back for a touchdown good the question is do i let them

1265
04:31:07,979 --> 04:31:13,059
second 31 hmm we'll see i'm gonna stay back

1266
04:31:17,370 --> 04:31:24,389
they're in 22 he's still got a long way to go

1267
04:31:40,149 --> 04:31:47,719
this is where they unravel and 30 check this out

1268
04:31:52,440 --> 04:32:05,350
it's a guaranteed touchdown and i'll just stay ahead they can boo me all they want

1269
04:32:06,069 --> 04:32:17,670
i'm gonna come away with a victory and the extra point is good easy game yeah i'm at d1

1270
04:32:19,780 --> 04:32:30,100
well you guys don't have to boo me it's huge what an explosive tackle

1271
04:32:41,819 --> 04:32:47,979
taken out of the play and that's in between did i bet on this i don't need to be win by like

1272
04:32:47,979 --> 04:32:56,549
how many did i bet i think i did like 13 grand right he's going long and complete defender

1273
04:32:56,549 --> 04:33:00,870
made sure there was no receiver there to make the catch as we reach the end of the third

1274
04:33:00,870 --> 04:33:07,750
quarter las vegas leads by 14 come on man i can't believe i'm gonna beat blitz the league

1275
04:33:07,750 --> 04:33:32,090
two on spring add that to things i never thought i was going to do but i love it i'm having a lot

1276
04:33:32,090 --> 04:33:43,590
of fun it is a classic he's gonna pass the guy up here oh watch out puts it up and it's complete

1277
04:33:43,590 --> 04:33:48,790
after 48 out of bounds and that'll end this offensive series you can see how pumped up the

1278
04:33:48,790 --> 04:33:58,569
defense is after that big stop first and 30 all the way to 48 yard line make sure he doesn't

1279
04:33:58,889 --> 04:34:15,080
get that that was really sloppy second down and about a mile not bad that was dumb as hell yeah

1280
04:34:15,080 --> 04:34:28,970
it was we have a long day ahead of us check it ready out of bounds out of bounds out of

1281
04:34:28,970 --> 04:34:43,779
bounds right up in the middle this offense can smell the end zone runs it outside oh you know

1282
04:34:43,779 --> 04:35:05,590
what i'm gonna do be stopped i love it i love how it works there's not much you can do

1283
04:35:05,590 --> 04:35:19,720
against that though if i'm honest when you only need to go one inch point is good all right i'm

1284
04:35:19,720 --> 04:35:33,220
getting overconfident here i'm gonna be three and oh in division one just too much confidence

1285
04:35:33,220 --> 04:35:42,099
he's gonna have way too much confidence destroying who are supposed to be the division one

1286
04:35:42,099 --> 04:36:18,520
champions 36 seven good luck thank you for getting that because i didn't i wouldn't have

what arrogance first down 30 yards to go a high five and they're shaking hands already

1290
04:36:53,369 --> 04:37:05,130

1301
04:39:18,259 --> 04:39:28,299
playing together not just on the field at the same time together what's done is done hey man

1302
04:39:28,299 --> 04:39:34,709
i fucked up all right but if we work tight we could nail the commissioner and win the title

1303
04:39:34,709 --> 04:39:41,770
in the process nailed a commissioner don't you work for him not anymore now i just want to bring

stomachs and stuff it's weird i know what it is i'm just kidding jesus i hope you don't mind

1306
04:40:05,419 --> 04:40:09,659

1307
04:40:09,659 --> 04:40:20,139
equipment was so out of date more equipment is bruno hey punk i think you didn't expect to

1312
04:40:56,060 --> 04:41:07,299
we're not going to do it i want to save money too what did i get well tackle break tackle

1313
04:41:13,479 --> 04:41:20,470

04:43:44,950 --> 04:43:52,709
uh come on i got it i did it

1325
04:43:56,419 --> 04:43:59,860
all right safety safety safety here comes the safety you gotta get a sack safety

1326
04:44:14,069 --> 04:44:19,860
i think i don't have a chance for safety how am i supposed to get sacks as a safety

1327
04:44:20,740 --> 04:44:41,380
i need to get one you still caught it you i can't i can't fucking believe it now

1328
04:44:42,340 --> 04:44:48,500
that's actually unbelievable los angeles really executed on that play and took a big step

1329
04:44:48,500 --> 04:44:52,099
i smashed him in the side and he fell down he got back up and caught the ball

1330
04:44:53,380 --> 04:45:03,669
just infuriated that's the end of the first quarter just splits every play i have to be for

1331
04:45:03,669 --> 04:45:11,799
brian i have to offense facing a second and goal here ball at the 33 yard line

1332
04:45:11,799 --> 04:45:26,860
oh boy he really took a shot let's see bladder weighing down wait till after the first quarter

1333
04:45:26,860 --> 04:45:33,479
second quarter i mean no wait till after this game juice on the net the offense might want

1334
04:45:33,479 --> 04:45:48,220
to mix it up here they've been a little predictable the first two downs it's always

1335
04:45:48,220 --> 04:45:57,479
the call of one every time three games going you're up that means you're not going to be

1336
04:45:57,479 --> 04:46:04,779
there for the championship game if you're there to kick in a field goal you're not going to

1337
04:46:04,779 --> 04:46:22,330
get it the field goal is good okay all right give me this good possession here if you don't

1338
04:46:22,330 --> 04:46:39,240

collarbone three two one oh back three plays no that's not whatever first and

1344
04:48:16,299 --> 04:48:39,580

1345
04:48:39,580 --> 04:48:48,500

1349
04:49:42,310 --> 04:49:50,259
wall at the 50 yard line we've got a great halfback i'm telling you i'm telling you the

1350
04:49:50,259 --> 04:49:53,619
computer you can't do those weird trick plays against maybe you can do it against

1351
04:49:53,619 --> 04:49:59,639
your friend not the computer it's not gonna happen uh i got like one more play maybe

1352
04:50:12,840 --> 04:50:26,279
oh my god sullivan you're the fucking mvp for real wow definitely team mvp for sure

1353
04:50:28,540 --> 04:50:40,740
not down in my mind now he's blocked it and the extra point is good

1354
04:50:43,479 --> 04:50:48,200
and with the first half in the books las vegas leads by 11 do i get the ball too

1355
04:50:51,700 --> 04:51:08,310
well it's good that i just did that then oops it's time to yearn not yet he's gonna drop it

1356
04:51:09,110 --> 04:51:21,189
looks like a thunder las vegas makes the recovery this is very good we have to be we have to be

1357
04:51:22,150 --> 04:51:41,220
what happened did you see that why do they just roll over each other watch this oh it's not

1358
04:51:41,220 --> 04:52:02,939
enough oh well get the hat back in there give it to sullivan he's just i took three people

1359
04:52:02,939 --> 04:52:16,979
to get him down again this same play this time it's a touchdown how did that happen

1360
04:52:18,069 --> 04:52:26,279
i didn't even do that that guy just he went on his back how would your balls explode

1361
04:52:29,000 --> 04:52:35,779
las vegas hang on buddy he'd his pants here let me help you let me help you i'll tell you this

1362
04:52:35,779 --> 04:52:39,779
is great because storyline wise the riots are definitely going to be in the championship

1363
04:52:40,580 --> 04:52:45,639
like so seeing all these guys go down for more than six games

1364
04:53:02,779 --> 04:53:06,540
when all their starters are down for six games all they have is the backups

1365
04:53:07,500 --> 04:53:24,069
i need to injure their star player it's not this guy they might all just be in there

1366
04:53:24,069 --> 04:53:37,689
anyways yeah probably down 30 yards to go see if i can get a sack use defenders at his wake on

1367
04:53:37,849 --> 04:53:48,810
that one quite a gallop watch that unleash

1368
04:53:54,040 --> 04:54:10,970
who was that whatever we're gonna get one sprained neck shortstop yeah he's not gonna

1369
04:54:10,970 --> 04:54:17,349
be playing ball yeah he'll be fine hold on buddy hey get the card out take it easy buddy

1370
04:54:17,349 --> 04:54:31,479
it'll be over in a second he's dead no he just he just like did a kink in his neck

1371
04:54:32,200 --> 04:54:56,650
i've gotten pretty good at that does that count as a sack i don't think it does what

1372
04:55:16,860 --> 04:55:19,659
i don't even know how that happened he just kind of looking at first and

1373
04:55:19,740 --> 04:55:21,659
popped in there and knocked into my leg

1374
04:55:31,689 --> 04:55:35,049
oh shit no no no no no i didn't want to do that i wanted to die for it

1375
04:56:01,770 --> 04:56:20,659
pick it up better i'm gonna save money i have to get at least two or three things to level

1376
04:56:20,659 --> 04:56:26,099
three before the circle because at this rate i'm definitely gonna get in there

1377
04:56:27,669 --> 04:56:32,709
all right season ending career ending injuries three two one not to me though thank god

1378
04:56:33,990 --> 04:56:42,819
just get right back up las vegas comes up with a turnover as we reach the end of the

1379
04:56:42,819 --> 04:56:49,930
third quarter las vegas leads by 18 yes

1380
04:56:55,900 --> 04:56:56,700
30 yards to go

1381
04:56:58,549 --> 04:57:05,270
looking good uh there you are there you go memes coming in after an injury

1382
04:57:13,540 --> 04:57:18,569

04:57:18,569 --> 04:57:28,599
rodem rupture that was embarrassing no it wasn't it's fine i know what i'm doing

05:01:13,110 --> 05:01:17,029
has a real nose for the ball that's his second pick today here's the idea ready

1399
05:01:26,099 --> 05:01:47,459
catch it uh punt punt punt punt the ball no but that's gonna be too long i can't sack

1400
05:01:47,459 --> 05:01:52,840
i have to immediately get this guy on the ground just have it be awful

1401
05:01:53,400 --> 05:02:09,590
okay so see if i can kill this guy and so las vegas wins the game i actually got it how

1402
05:02:10,549 --> 05:02:19,740
didn't he get one we both got one did i get more than one i had to all right

1403
05:02:21,270 --> 05:02:34,599
make it from the field goal that's possible yeah nice new touchdown code square circle

1404
05:02:34,599 --> 05:02:51,740
triangle circle cool go back it up it's the second that's like the third time i've embarrassed

1405
05:02:51,740 --> 05:02:57,020
the la riot we're going to new york this sunday that means we get another shot at max

1406
05:02:57,020 --> 05:03:03,500
carson that kid those assholes drafted replace me we're gonna make them regret that shit so

1407
05:03:03,500 --> 05:03:09,020
prevent max carson from getting any sacks or injure carson with an unleashed power move next

1408
05:03:09,020 --> 05:03:18,229
game i get it you've got game maybe you ain't just some punk ass college wannabe but like i

1409
05:03:18,229 --> 05:03:29,700
told you earlier me and the riot shut up okay still got that girlfriend trainer upgrades

1410
05:03:30,580 --> 05:03:33,189
this is probably one of the last times i'm gonna be able to do this

1411
05:03:34,069 --> 05:03:44,709
what do you think strength passing break tackle this is so important i would say either passing

1412
05:03:44,709 --> 05:03:56,869
or break tackle passing passing agility yeah no passing yeah we're gonna do yeah

1413
05:03:59,349 --> 05:04:02,709
if i have enough money i got that they have to play two more games one more game to

1414
05:04:02,709 --> 05:04:08,119
clinch the playoffs the championship i should be able to do it one more time

1415
05:04:11,270 --> 05:04:16,549
we got keep the money i didn't need it except maybe yeah too much risk no don't even do it don't

1416
05:04:16,549 --> 05:04:24,740
don't waste any money nobody's injured everyone's good to go uh next game against the new york

1417
05:04:24,740 --> 05:04:33,240
nightmare and i will take a piss so everyone can take a piss and relax see you guys in like

1418
05:04:33,240 --> 05:06:54,360
two minutes y'all back did everybody pee i hope so new york nightmare hell let's go

1419
05:06:54,360 --> 05:07:07,689
win by 19 points no save money that's a really stacked team the new york nightmares linebacker

1420
05:07:07,689 --> 05:07:13,930
max carson is the second coming of quentin so hurt this guy fast strong and mean off the field

1421
05:07:13,930 --> 05:07:18,810
the comparisons to sands and carson keeps to himself that doesn't necessarily fit the new

1422
05:07:18,810 --> 05:07:31,139
york nightmare style no fast cars or fast women fans are complaining ow why would you do

1423
05:07:31,139 --> 05:07:41,220
something like that you're a professional football player you're trying to bench

1424
05:07:41,299 --> 05:07:53,590
yourself for the whole year don't do that wear gloves no focus but they have lots of

1425
05:07:53,590 --> 05:08:01,979
athleticism he's trying to be cool you just don't understand good evening everyone at

1426
05:08:01,979 --> 05:08:07,740
this point of the division i'm gonna injure carson with an unleashed move it sounds like

1427
05:08:07,740 --> 05:08:11,180
the easiest of all the things they can keep doing what they're doing and it looks like

1428
05:08:11,180 --> 05:08:23,270
we're set for the kickoff they look like the ravens the bells are gotta be ringing in his

1429
05:08:23,590 --> 05:08:26,950
yeah they really do look like the ravens how am i i gotta injure him with an unleashed move

1430
05:08:31,450 --> 05:08:36,250
so i have to get unleashed and then stop him and hope i break his neck

1431
05:08:39,290 --> 05:08:39,930
it's gonna be hard

1432
05:08:48,840 --> 05:08:58,490
third down let's go with hop and pop

1433
05:08:58,490 --> 05:09:06,139
oh no no no no not the hand not the hand

1434
05:09:07,259 --> 05:09:14,419
uh not the hand it's probably been six fucking games give me a break

1435
05:09:15,380 --> 05:09:29,400
fourth and eight what would bill belichick do he'd go for it

1436
05:09:30,779 --> 05:09:31,419
his face

1437
05:09:34,299 --> 05:09:37,659
the quarterback needs to make sure his throw gets there before the defender i think

1438
05:09:38,779 --> 05:09:42,860
that's uh degrading to me that i'm like degraded right now because of that

1439
05:09:44,060 --> 05:09:53,110
out again for six fucking games it's very bad this is nothing we might lose this thing

1440
05:10:00,310 --> 05:10:04,569
sullivan out on first possession oh yeah sullivan comes in for a game

1441
05:10:05,450 --> 05:10:12,009
in the first minute of the game breaks his wrist he's out for two games comes back in scores like

1442
05:10:12,009 --> 05:10:26,299
four touchdowns breaks his wrist again and is up for like another two games boy is he fantastic

1443
05:10:26,299 --> 05:10:36,169
when he gets to play but i don't know how much time he's had on the field versus off

1444
05:10:36,970 --> 05:10:42,540
you know here's what i'm first down and 30 i'm in trouble here they have an unleashed

1445
05:10:43,500 --> 05:10:53,610
oh no tricks

1446
05:11:10,970 --> 05:11:16,709
all right run it who's it cox you got this

1447
05:11:22,700 --> 05:11:26,549
he's safe

1448
05:11:29,349 --> 05:11:36,380
let's do some more classes of downs here all right i gotta get this touchdown right now

1449
05:11:36,380 --> 05:11:41,770
right here bingo what is it what was it what was it what was it it is

1450
05:11:42,729 --> 05:11:44,810
square circle triangle circle

1451
05:12:15,669 --> 05:12:26,169
i just didn't how would i ever expect it's a fucking football game guys how could i ever

1452
05:12:26,169 --> 05:12:37,130
expect that was gonna okay so uh seven to seven by the way if anyone was scared

1453
05:12:42,279 --> 05:12:51,509
don't think so and so at the end of one quarter of play we're tied

1454
05:12:51,990 --> 05:13:06,860
i wanted to see that what the hell it's all right square circle triangle circle got it

1455
05:13:13,529 --> 05:13:27,240
had an opportunity to go for the ass colabones it's all three plays that's it all right i have

1456
05:13:27,240 --> 05:13:34,259

1462
05:14:40,180 --> 05:14:54,490
and he's down at the two yard line los vegas really executed on that play and took a big

1463
05:14:54,490 --> 05:15:02,419
step down the field nice work big series of downs upcoming that's not a touchdown

1464
05:15:02,979 --> 05:15:11,159
i stepped in there i stepped in there look at that foot look at this foot left foot is

1465
05:15:11,159 --> 05:15:26,299
clearly over the line and inside unbelievable los vegas now leads by six i don't know the hell it

1466
05:15:26,299 --> 05:15:48,650
was solidified my place in the championship game i have to win that super bowl that's the

1467
05:15:48,650 --> 05:15:59,270
that's the end of the game and as i win some power points here

1468
05:16:03,130 --> 05:16:12,090

1470
05:16:18,409 --> 05:16:32,549
looking at first and 30 ball at the 31 i wonder what i'm gonna get now you guys ain't

1471
05:16:32,549 --> 05:16:37,340
gonna pinwheel you know i'm not gonna get pinwheeled on this one i'm very clearly like

1472
05:16:37,340 --> 05:16:41,979
12 and 2 not 4 and 9 i wouldn't be in division 1 if i was 4 and 9

1473
05:16:42,380 --> 05:17:08,150
i didn't who caught it i thought i caught that

1474
05:17:10,630 --> 05:17:15,590
it was clearly in my hand what kind of video game you got running here

1475
05:17:18,819 --> 05:17:25,930
it was in that was my hands that it touched very nice game

1476
05:17:27,700 --> 05:17:31,540
field goal what the hell are you faking a field goal right now

1477
05:17:32,419 --> 05:17:37,860
the field goal is good why would you kick a field goal at first and goal

1478
05:17:46,580 --> 05:17:53,220
seven seconds left yeah but now i get the ball again and i'm gonna score under the touchdown

1479
05:18:05,509 --> 05:18:07,930

1480
05:18:22,459 --> 05:18:24,459
oh my god please get down

1481
05:18:25,099 --> 05:18:32,659
and so at los vegas leads by four he almost stood back up and i would have screamed

1482
05:18:39,610 --> 05:18:52,759
oh my god do it do a funny scream first down and 30 no i don't want i gotta tone down my

1483
05:18:52,759 --> 05:19:10,250
screaming fucking gotta be kidding me new york exploits an opening in the defense for some

1484
05:19:10,250 --> 05:19:15,849
real yardage on that play first and goal it's gut check time it's a pass 31 can i turn my own

seven seconds and then fall down

1489
05:20:22,090 --> 05:20:26,490
the captain is still in the game too this is bad 30 yards to go field goal wins the game

05:32:57,819 --> 05:33:11,220

1544
05:33:11,779 --> 05:33:16,900
and mike i don't even know what the fuck i'm saying how it's hard for me to talk and play

1546
05:33:32,099 --> 05:33:46,330
smelling the pie air and i'm floating by i don't even know what the fuck that means first

1552
05:35:18,779 --> 05:35:28,819

1555
05:35:55,130 --> 05:36:18,779
i don't fucking understand get it and fucking make him drop the ball fumble

1556
05:36:26,599 --> 05:36:36,310
what is this shit okay he catches the ball this guy on the left 51 thought he caught it he's

1557
05:36:36,310 --> 05:36:45,500
pretending to catch it for some reason 81 then runs into 26 who falls down 36 then cannot

1558
05:36:45,500 --> 05:36:49,259
drag him down to the ground and he makes it out four people just acted like idiots

1559
05:36:52,310 --> 05:37:03,979
unbelievable there was like five toddlers versus the rock i just killed somebody who did i just

1560
05:37:03,979 --> 05:37:22,279
kill uh i've snapped somebody's neck here i even flipped like that nice three musketeers joke

1561
05:37:24,759 --> 05:37:37,939
the three musketeers like the fucking candy first down 30 yards to go

1562
05:37:37,939 --> 05:37:51,240
go get up there i know steve martin martin short i know what that movie is

1563
05:37:51,880 --> 05:37:53,159

1564
05:38:05,880 --> 05:38:10,779
will you looking for the big play you can still get it you can still get it

1565
05:38:12,459 --> 05:38:44,180
in the end zone touchdown we're good do i stay now just stay in default dance touchdown

1566
05:38:44,180 --> 05:38:52,599
celebration and that technically is a default dancing you're not wrong this is the guy that

1567
05:38:52,599 --> 05:39:02,099
beat the super bowl on stream not yet it's not even the end of the first quarter and

1568
05:39:02,099 --> 05:39:10,599
it's already this many interesting okay first and 30 ball at the 30 yard line f f

1569
05:39:13,000 --> 05:39:26,380

1570
05:39:26,380 --> 05:39:37,689
down second down oh they're just messing around with me i'm doing a lot of good stamina drains

1571
05:39:37,689 --> 05:39:44,659
here too just keep playing smart and then it doesn't matter if i lose the next game

1572
05:39:48,040 --> 05:40:16,490
third down sack sack sack and that's the qb see you now that should solidify a win i think

1573
05:40:24,020 --> 05:40:27,459
see speaking of see i think vinnie started his stream

1574
05:40:29,860 --> 05:40:32,659
right after that one oh fuck i gotta get this i gotta get this punk

1575

1577
05:41:00,549 --> 05:41:09,580
standards no career ruined you're going to the bench let's go that could have just ended

1578
05:41:09,580 --> 05:41:27,380
the career who's the quarterback number 12 gilote it's pretty good he's pretty good

1579
05:41:39,110 --> 05:41:50,729
nice man this beautiful catch that's a first down i'm gonna go with get it to the half back

1581
05:41:59,259 --> 05:42:11,020
yellow los vegas for a nice game there thanks to some key downfield blocks

1582
05:42:12,680 --> 05:42:29,479
no no you know what i'm doing what's the new one proposal uh pylon kick yeah

1583
05:42:30,889 --> 05:42:35,029

1585
05:42:53,770 --> 05:43:19,290
i'm not going to get like another prilosec ad bring back madden bring back but maybe in a

1586
05:43:19,290 --> 05:43:42,330
minute unleash here let's go with uh prevention defense sounds pretty good sack kill other

1587
05:43:42,330 --> 05:43:56,650
photograph who got it me or him that was their star player right oh we both activated the

1588
05:43:57,770 --> 05:43:58,650
unleash at the same time

1589
05:44:05,259 --> 05:44:18,580
ah third down is a run it's gonna be a pass it's the opposite of what they say every time

1590
05:44:19,540 --> 05:44:33,560
fourth down they're probably gonna go for it bring back mad bring fourth and

1591
05:44:33,560 --> 05:44:46,139
ten leave what do you think they're gonna go for it no they're not i got one chance here

1592
05:44:46,139 --> 05:44:51,580
here

1593
05:44:58,439 --> 05:45:15,959
21 seven going good so far i'll get out i'll bring them back i'll bring them back behind your

1594
05:45:15,959 --> 05:45:28,619
blockers that's how you take care of that oh why is mims so slow oh no please tell me that

1595
05:45:28,619 --> 05:45:49,189
wasn't his knee knee they all just don't talk to me here let's go with oh we got a guy open

1596
05:45:49,189 --> 05:46:02,139
there excuse me oh excuse me nobody can stop me first down close to a first down no first down

1597
05:46:02,939 --> 05:46:17,610
really franchise brings the dinner bell again what can you say this guy's a winner that's

1598
05:46:17,610 --> 05:46:21,529
what they pay the big bucks players that are lucky these days heck when i used to play

1599
05:46:21,529 --> 05:46:25,849
twenty seven nickels around like manhole covers and if they if they really got managing they

1600
05:46:25,849 --> 05:46:29,450
throw manhole covers around like they were throwing man we are going to the real super

1601
05:46:29,450 --> 05:46:35,779
bowl in this game if i can actually just solidify this it don't matter what happens next

1602
05:46:36,979 --> 05:46:50,549
what is madden doing back by popular demand it brought him back it was almost a riot in here

1603
05:47:05,290 --> 05:47:08,330
let's just make it a guaranteed play that works every time

1604
05:47:08,889 --> 05:47:38,150
oh i did a little too early it was a guaranteed play it is messed up across right now still in

1605
05:47:38,150 --> 05:47:47,340
third quarter the offense looking at first and 30 ball at the 27 yard line wrong guy

1606
05:47:48,220 --> 05:48:03,639
they're all on the same team it means they're all the enemy straight in

1607
05:48:07,270 --> 05:48:10,950
las vegas has been dominant against the run so far i know i wouldn't want

1608
05:48:10,950 --> 05:48:16,409
to be out there carrying that ball today are there rugby games that are like this

1609
05:48:18,099 --> 05:48:25,380
um i don't think so i think i've only ever heard of one rugby game and wasn't like an

1610
05:48:25,380 --> 05:48:34,060
indie game i don't remember one releasing maybe they did he's going long incomplete

1611
05:48:34,060 --> 05:48:37,819
the quarterback needs to make sure his throw gets there before the defender i think

1612
05:48:37,819 --> 05:48:44,299
what them they uh field go another going for it oops well keep that one guy back there

1613
05:48:50,250 --> 05:48:53,450
guys guys good thing you're back here

1614
05:49:06,090 --> 05:49:11,139
as we reach the end of the third quarter las vegas leads by 27

1615
05:49:14,009 --> 05:49:19,209
i can't believe that check time like the quarterback just walked through the whole team

1616
05:49:19,209 --> 05:49:21,770
here we go again

1617
05:49:28,259 --> 05:49:50,200
let me see that again hit the ground it actually bounced off the ground

1618
05:49:51,610 --> 05:49:55,369
i'm just angry field goal blocking right now it's not what i should be doing but i'm gonna do

1619
05:49:55,369 --> 05:50:08,700
it anyway when you're behind and turn the ball over like that it doesn't do much for

1620
05:50:08,700 --> 05:50:12,619
your team's mental state get it out of here first down and 30

1621
05:50:12,619 --> 05:50:23,689
be right through the covers there's back there he was gently placing an egg inside

1622
05:50:23,689 --> 05:50:28,409
a silk stock that's something my high school coach used to say i can get one more

1623
05:50:30,970 --> 05:50:33,610
this was almost a game

1624
05:50:39,939 --> 05:50:45,159
no it depends and it's intercepted again you did bounce on the ground

1625
05:50:48,630 --> 05:50:53,029
how are you scooping these up so well 30 yards to go ball with the 49 yard line

1626
05:50:53,990 --> 05:51:11,209
las vegas has the football this game is fucking wacky who cares throw to the end zone

1627
05:51:30,779 --> 05:51:42,549
it worked yeah let's try to

1628
05:51:48,680 --> 05:51:56,099
let's rub it in now it's a good number well i was scared of new england for some reason

1629
05:51:56,979 --> 05:52:03,130
i got destroyed by new york you can still lose this no it's not physically possible to lose

1630
05:52:03,130 --> 05:52:28,840
this three i cannot lose this even thing on side picker cover they're a good team well

1631
05:52:29,720 --> 05:52:33,319
just look their stats were great and they're one of the division one leaders

1632
05:52:34,119 --> 05:52:37,580
i'm just going by what i see

1633
05:52:48,599 --> 05:52:52,279
he's got to be at the top two or 300 players have ever seen

1634
05:52:53,400 --> 05:52:59,799
at least that i can remember 350 top 300 players and he's knocked down

1635
05:53:02,970 --> 05:53:16,259
that one was funny this offensive series now we rub it in guys imagine that this is

1636
05:53:16,259 --> 05:53:20,099
the super bowl that you just saw wouldn't you just loved if you just like do this to new england

1637
05:53:20,099 --> 05:53:35,770
be like fuck you like fuck you loser more bully more bully fine a little bit more that's

1638
05:53:35,770 --> 05:54:00,860
all we need all right we got it off the mark oh first and 30 that's what happened if i got

1639
05:54:00,860 --> 05:54:12,090
up there i probably could do a better job than that actually no i want more time out time out

1640
05:54:12,090 --> 05:54:30,740
las vegas as the clock runs out las vegas is your winner here tonight defeat the new england

1641
05:54:30,740 --> 05:54:41,209
regulators in campaign mode did i bet on this one it's a lot of clash moves damn

1642
05:54:46,810 --> 05:55:01,990
all right devastator pads new sponsor here comes the final game of the season i believe

1643
05:55:02,709 --> 05:55:09,340
yeah i already already gonna be in the championship french i love you i told you i loved you recently

1644
05:55:09,340 --> 05:55:13,979
grace just dumped her old agent and signed with yours truly whatever you're doing

1645
05:55:13,979 --> 05:55:21,770
to make her happy keep doing it there's quentin so listen up i may have a way for us to get

1646
05:55:21,770 --> 05:55:26,090
back at the commission can't talk about it now but i'll check back with you later

1647
05:55:28,009 --> 05:55:31,130
looks like all the pain and suffering you've been dishing out is paying off

1648
05:55:31,130 --> 05:55:34,729
i've got pro for max on the other line and they want you to be the sponsor of their new

1649
05:55:34,729 --> 05:55:39,849
devastator line of pads i hear you can bust a hole in a cinder block wall with these things

1650
05:55:42,340 --> 05:55:54,279
really let's see that's pretty good so what are we putting the final point in i think

1651
05:55:56,779 --> 05:56:04,650
i've got enough for one more agility strength break tackle or tackle oh

1652
05:56:10,069 --> 05:56:22,279
um drugs break tackle break tackle i might have enough for one more after this last game

1653
05:56:23,080 --> 05:56:36,310
versus the vancouver beavers i'm not going to spend any money we're good do every drug no

1654
05:56:36,310 --> 05:56:46,520
no no no no drugs at all because then the championship game i can take all of them

1655
05:56:46,520 --> 05:56:57,080
so i've already solidified the championship game five and one when vancouver enters the

1656
05:56:57,080 --> 05:57:02,759
league a couple years back everyone laughs at the name beaver thanks to a solid defense and

1657
05:57:02,759 --> 05:57:09,080
the steady rhythm of tight end carlos cotto nobody's laughing now the guy can kill him

1658
05:57:09,080 --> 05:57:14,779
he's the funniest trash talker in the league let this guy get rolling or he will beat you

1659
05:57:14,779 --> 05:57:25,380
down so here's the plan i doesn't matter this game doesn't matter i'm going to

1660
05:57:27,189 --> 05:57:35,240
just play like an asshole i'm not going to get anybody hurt none of my teammates are

1661
05:57:35,240 --> 05:57:41,819
going to get hurt they all should be back i'm gonna throw the game i don't care if we lose

1662
05:57:42,459 --> 05:57:51,819
because i'm already in the super bowl winning does yes winning does get you more money

1663
05:57:52,700 --> 05:57:59,000
good evening everyone that's your right snow why would the what would the cheerleader is

1664
05:57:59,000 --> 05:58:23,939
running onto the field for snowy vancouver it's all right if you lose solomon you won't

1665
05:58:23,939 --> 05:58:26,419
happen for the final game that's why i'm not going to even do one play

1666
05:58:27,380 --> 05:58:44,409
so solomon is not going to get the ball once it actually did snow in vancouver

1667
05:58:47,479 --> 05:58:51,880
the captain comes through for this team once again plays like he's running over and over

1668
05:58:51,880 --> 05:59:02,860
again at this point which is too bad that's not a bad idea anybody ever questions this

1669
05:59:02,860 --> 05:59:07,979
guy's leadership may can just look to a play like that fifth play of the drive

1670
05:59:12,020 --> 05:59:18,790
franchise gives the fans exactly what they came to see right there each of those

1671
05:59:19,029 --> 05:59:22,150
for the other team will admit that this guy brings excitement to the game

1672
05:59:22,150 --> 05:59:24,630
they're in the red zone now time to capitalize

1673
05:59:27,110 --> 05:59:40,520
full line touchdown let's just do that every single play why even play the game normally

1674
05:59:44,060 --> 05:59:47,580
six hours in you're gonna spam the same because i i don't i don't have to worry about it

1675
05:59:48,139 --> 06:00:04,169
let's do it again version is good i found the meta this is a really lame game to watch

1676
06:00:04,729 --> 06:00:22,020
it's almost very good imagine that worked i got a rupture his spleen if i'm not careful i'll get my

1677
06:00:22,020 --> 06:00:28,439
own spleen rupture that would be bad super bowl might get a fractured skull

1678
06:00:35,880 --> 06:00:39,560
now i'm not gonna get a career ending injury i just need to be above by more than five to

1679
06:00:39,560 --> 06:01:04,810
ten points it's all that matters third down third and 13 turn it over that kind of froze

1680
06:01:04,810 --> 06:01:10,419
up there in the middle this is a big fourth down coming up it comes upon field goal you're

1681
06:01:10,419 --> 06:01:20,819
not gonna get it look at that wind and it's good that's stuck on own teammates yeah somehow

1682
06:01:21,459 --> 06:01:37,740
it's all good really i thought i had to usually that's slow most different

1683
06:01:37,740 --> 06:01:51,560
i can just stuff into people uh-oh who is that sorry they don't matter

1684
06:01:53,180 --> 06:02:02,060
82 28 is the one that matters las vegas leads by five so if your main dude gets badly injured

1685
06:02:02,060 --> 06:02:07,939
is it legit just game over uh it is your save file does not get deleted

1686
06:02:08,979 --> 06:02:17,669
but you have to go back to your last save what okay what will you what the hell are you

1687
06:02:17,669 --> 06:02:25,049
doing so no Sullivan doesn't i don't want Sullivan to have a ball that was freaking

1688
06:02:25,049 --> 06:02:31,860
me out what the hell are you doing like their chances here on third and short i mean

1689
06:02:31,860 --> 06:02:45,669
you're that's how you do it with the first x was touchdown you don't know a series of downs here

1690
06:02:47,669 --> 06:02:57,159
prison all over again block in practice why should he make it in the game

1691
06:02:58,040 --> 06:03:13,110
second to goal the whole team is here that was unbelievable she's at least six people

1692
06:03:25,959 --> 06:03:47,240
very good i can unleash someone if i can strip it i hate this

1693
06:03:53,740 --> 06:04:00,970
qb sneak into the right episode here comes an injury on the collarbone

1694
06:04:18,700 --> 06:04:25,340
wow i'm surprised i didn't get that back with under 30 seconds to play in the first half

1695
06:04:25,340 --> 06:04:35,029
las vegas leads by 13 what down i'll take that ball back

1696
06:04:35,830 --> 06:04:55,110
oh he breaks his fucking collarbone kick it kick do it again give me that ball he's going for

1697
06:04:59,930 --> 06:05:00,970
oh fuck

1698
06:05:05,610 --> 06:05:10,490
Vancouver saw something in the defense and jumped on it a big game sets them up in nice

1699
06:05:10,490 --> 06:05:18,340
field position and so at halftime leads by 13 and i can't wait for the championship game

1700
06:05:18,340 --> 06:05:31,509
i'm gonna be so amped up for it and i'm gonna let up either even if i'm up by like 60 points

1701
06:05:31,509 --> 06:05:50,900
i'm still gonna play as hard as i can just can't string anything together they keep going for the

1702
06:05:50,900 --> 06:05:55,540
same run don't you know i am the only one that can do that maybe if you did your quarterback

1703
06:05:55,540 --> 06:06:05,529
to do the same like diaper run to the right it's not it's not gonna happen i'm sorry it's

1704
06:06:05,529 --> 06:06:14,619
not going to

1705
06:06:18,330 --> 06:06:26,549
somebody get him good fourth and 31 is it a field goal

1706
06:06:27,509 --> 06:06:45,450
no they have to punt it yeah turn off good field position too for some reason i thought

1707
06:06:45,450 --> 06:06:50,090
he's gonna die i was gonna try to jump over him first down and 30

1708
06:06:58,779 --> 06:07:01,500
fundamentals just keep the clock going they got an unleash not yet

1709
06:07:02,299 --> 06:07:07,020
24 second down and quite a ways to go fucking i'm going to the right check this

1710
06:07:08,380 --> 06:07:16,919
he just left the right wide open vancouver just looks weak against them that means the

1711
06:07:16,919 --> 06:07:25,880
offense is at their leisure to chew up yards and the clock first and goal it's gut check time

1712
06:07:25,880 --> 06:07:36,380
ball at the 20 yard line he's hit and dropped the quarterback received absolutely no mercy he

1713
06:07:36,380 --> 06:07:47,580
was taken down hard yeah right back to him it's okay you hate to see a hit like that

1714
06:07:47,580 --> 06:07:57,259
that sort of thing sure don't just let the time run up and so with three quarters gone

1715
06:07:57,259 --> 06:08:04,569
las vegas this quarterback doesn't understand the pocket no i don't you're right third down

1716
06:08:04,729 --> 06:08:05,369
i really don't

1717
06:08:18,840 --> 06:08:21,000
i can't have 23 points i don't like that number

1718
06:08:36,659 --> 06:08:54,340
i'm not having the devil's number it's bad luck i'll get it back right now still how long do

1719
06:08:54,340 --> 06:09:13,349
it though so all right last quarter that's intercepted that turnover just adds to this

1720
06:09:13,349 --> 06:09:17,349
team's long list 100 guaranteed i don't see how they're going to turn it around at this point

1721
06:09:19,349 --> 06:09:22,869
big series of downs upcoming ball of the 17 yard line

1722
06:09:24,229 --> 06:09:37,659
sir this game doesn't matter such an amazing game the next one sure does

1723
06:09:42,630 --> 06:09:52,090
zone and he makes the crap what what did i even end up fuck it whatever guaranteed win writer

1724
06:09:52,970 --> 06:10:02,220
three two franchise adds six more to his personal total

1725
06:10:06,330 --> 06:10:21,419
he's going the wrong way 28's good get 30 that's two points

1726
06:10:22,380 --> 06:10:42,459
so now it's just a question of building up some tackles for more money like this

1727
06:10:43,580 --> 06:10:51,580
i'm gonna throw the game i know i did say that

1728
06:10:58,580 --> 06:11:03,619
oh going all out blitz 30 yards to go try to murder the quarterback that sounds like a

1729
06:11:03,619 --> 06:11:14,009
plan what um that's not he's not done apparently somehow he's dead

1730
06:11:23,659 --> 06:11:29,380
covers it up that was really dumb

1731
06:11:32,549 --> 06:11:48,360
fucking tom and jerry that shit is good it's all right on side kick the don't even forget

1732
06:11:54,650 --> 06:12:01,700
that was brutal but i still got it first and 30 ball at the 40 yard mark

1733
06:12:02,419 --> 06:12:19,689
he fell all right let's run what he's gonna gently run the ball don't get hurt

1734
06:12:21,450 --> 06:12:25,259
he has no more time on every question everyone's gonna think i'm an

1735
06:12:25,259 --> 06:13:00,340
asshole for this you're gonna think i'm fucking crazy oops game over he takes it inside

1736

1787
06:21:58,310 --> 06:22:01,990
fall forward at the same speed i mean you're still still in the game after the first play

1788
06:22:07,930 --> 06:22:18,090
still do it again get the ball to Sullivan easy run across go across the plane oh it's

1789
06:22:18,090 --> 06:22:23,450
okay and that's the end of the first quarter as las vegas leads by four is he going to

1790
06:22:23,450 --> 06:22:30,759
complete the game tonight you're looking at it right now this is the super bowl vegas versus

1791
06:22:30,759 --> 06:22:51,590
la why is everybody laughing why is everybody laughing what happened get in there Sullivan

1792
06:23:01,750 --> 06:23:12,340
75 points i told you that's the real super bowl i've beaten the riot like three or four times

1793
06:23:12,340 --> 06:23:34,119
in a row they don't scare me at all injury we get spongebob at the halftime show

1794
06:23:35,900 --> 06:23:43,580
yeah i'll have spongebob start his act and then i'll delete the screen he'll be on screen for

1795
06:23:43,580 --> 06:24:02,330
like three seconds check this out that's not a fumble somehow just like in the real super

1796
06:24:02,330 --> 06:24:20,330
ball that's right um second and 11 i'm gonna stay back there it is las vegas makes the

1797
06:24:20,330 --> 06:24:28,220
recovery i didn't get a point come on give me a point we're getting something different

1798
06:24:28,860 --> 06:24:33,580
for these sorts of moments all that living in the shadow of the offense is worth it when you can

1799
06:24:33,580 --> 06:24:47,479
score oh he should be careful no excuse mark the league might find him it's only the second

1800
06:24:47,479 --> 06:24:53,799
quarter there's still potential oops oops how many times have i went oops and the extra

1801
06:24:53,799 --> 06:25:21,860
point is oops oops keep thinking those are fumbles you aren't on pace to hit 75 this game

1802
06:25:21,939 --> 06:25:24,919
is not really

1803
06:25:27,560 --> 06:25:32,250
i'll say that now of course it certainly doesn't help when he's but here we go

1804
06:25:34,119 --> 06:25:38,360
you know what what you gotta do you know is when life hands you lemon what you gotta do

1805
06:25:38,360 --> 06:25:48,060
is not squirt it oh what do you say when life gives you lemons do what

1806
06:26:00,119 --> 06:26:06,380
which is funny because the dog i just thought they should have named him fluffy

1807
06:26:06,380 --> 06:26:12,040
don't squaw don't squirt it uh looking like i'm gonna win the super bowl here

1808
06:26:13,590 --> 06:26:15,669
this is gonna turn into a blowout i think

1809
06:26:26,200 --> 06:26:31,000
and the extra point is good what is this guy's name have they even said his name

1810
06:26:36,970 --> 06:26:39,369
they don't refer to him as anything it's just other guy

1811
06:26:39,369 --> 06:27:01,619
they're pretty far back though john madden

1812
06:27:10,470 --> 06:27:18,759
i'm not gonna lie i just switched character and hit dive over and over again no bm what am i

1813
06:27:18,759 --> 06:27:27,369
doing just make it happen no bm this is a big fourth down coming up why are they using the

1814
06:27:27,369 --> 06:27:35,159
timeout no timeout this is a super bowl how do you make that mistake so at halftime las vegas

1815
06:27:35,159 --> 06:28:29,930
leads by 25 that's it you know these guys may seem tough but they're softies i heard that

1816
06:28:29,930 --> 06:28:35,290
one of these guys are not gonna say but but he offered a ride home to a young woman walking

1817
06:28:35,290 --> 06:28:39,529
through dangerous part of town just last night today he ended up giving her a ride and all he

1818
06:28:39,529 --> 06:28:48,740
said was honestly that's right there you're still better than the actual super bowl one

1819
06:28:56,659 --> 06:29:04,580
that was that's what they did at the super bowl just really screaming this

1820
06:29:04,580 --> 06:29:09,319
simply cannot get there running it looks like their coach is determined to keep trying

1821
06:29:09,319 --> 06:29:13,319
and i'll play it for real okay fine i'm gonna you know fucking play it during the game

1822
06:29:14,200 --> 06:29:18,330
no i don't want it on the halftime show i wanted to be playing while i'm

1823
06:29:18,409 --> 06:29:30,840
trying to win the game i don't know why they didn't do what he's thinking in the middle of

1824
06:29:31,479 --> 06:29:53,479
turn this shit off it's gonna match

1825
06:30:05,529 --> 06:31:11,909
oh and there it is it's auto play here we go here we go

1826
06:31:18,490 --> 06:31:22,490
and that puts it away that's game over who gives a shit i'm gonna throw the ball in

1827
06:31:22,490 --> 06:31:36,889
the end zone every play i'm gonna be the most hated team in the league free and the conversion

1828
06:31:36,889 --> 06:31:48,599
is good punt every possession okay no that sucks that all right no actually i'm yeah sure

1829
06:31:49,400 --> 06:32:13,049
go for 75 i'm gonna blitz every play 30 75 to three you know i'll try i can still get that

1830
06:32:13,770 --> 06:32:30,139
damn it worth a shot field goal block every play you know i'll give you a little story

1831
06:32:31,590 --> 06:32:38,659
back when madden was really really popular uh my brother used to want to play against me all

1832
06:32:38,659 --> 06:32:42,500
the time he's a huge fan i didn't know what the hell was going on i was probably like 12

1833
06:32:43,299 --> 06:32:47,619
so my older brother was a big fan of madden and he would always want to play with me

1834
06:32:47,619 --> 06:32:51,619
because who else are you gonna play with he would have some friends over sometimes but

1835
06:32:51,619 --> 06:32:56,900
anyways so i had no idea what the fuck i was doing red zone offense here so i just did field

1836
06:32:56,900 --> 06:33:02,099
goal block every play and i'm not kidding he would he would just do pass plays and

1837
06:33:02,659 --> 06:33:07,459
cool runs and stuff like that and it would end up being like 120

1838
06:33:10,419 --> 06:33:18,259
because i didn't know what the fuck was going on oh yes uh it would be over

1839
06:33:18,259 --> 06:33:24,020
a hundred something points each game i'm like having these flashbacks right now

1840
06:33:27,860 --> 06:33:31,220
i would do hail mary's every play and he would just intercept them because he knew how to

1841
06:33:31,220 --> 06:33:38,729
control the game and catch doing a manual catch field goal blocks and hail mary's

1842
06:33:41,340 --> 06:33:53,779
oh this is yeah this is embarrassing at this point it's embarrassing oops this is embarrassing

1843
06:33:53,779 --> 06:34:01,639
for them it's this is embarrassing oops the stream first down and 30 ball at the 33 yard line

1844
06:34:02,279 --> 06:34:36,650
i can't stop it did i catch it i got it into the end zone make sure all right it's worth that

1845
06:34:36,650 --> 06:34:50,549
all right let's go all right you know all right oops jukes touchdown franchise with six more

1846
06:34:50,549 --> 06:34:54,950
points do i know why athletes get paid so much money look no further than that play right there

1847
06:34:54,950 --> 06:34:58,310
i'm sure he's not pulling people out of a burning building or teaching a young

1848
06:34:58,310 --> 06:35:02,869
what's your name but this guy plays the game very very well and that's worth tens of millions

1849
06:35:02,869 --> 06:35:35,540
of dollars in my book i win i love how we have devolved to just me not giving shit

1850
06:35:41,750 --> 06:35:51,080
i just got home alone like i'm up by so much i've trained my team so well there was a

1851
06:35:51,080 --> 06:35:53,959
challenge here in the first few games of division but now it doesn't even matter

1852
06:35:55,209 --> 06:36:03,450
oh good for you you got 15 points

1853
06:36:17,450 --> 06:36:40,659
it fucking destroyed 75 points now it's not possible anymore first down 30 yards to go

1854
06:36:43,220 --> 06:36:48,569
looking for the big play he's got it i mean maybe it is

1855
06:36:49,369 --> 06:37:03,259
oh and touchdown i might get i might get 50 or 60 maybe not 70 it's false with me to get 60

1856
06:37:03,819 --> 06:37:19,659
and that's two points just jumped backwards use those timeouts i'm gonna go for it i'll try

1857
06:37:21,259 --> 06:37:36,409

1858
06:37:38,180 --> 06:37:50,340

you had time you had time it's okay another interception turn it into a score

1862
06:38:40,020 --> 06:38:45,779

1863
06:38:45,779 --> 06:38:52,279
well we can do it let me just do something real quick here i need to get one completion

1914
06:47:47,720 --> 06:48:01,319

1915
06:48:01,319 --> 06:48:05,479
butterfingers it's total chaos on the field with every tackle leading into a fumble

1916
06:48:08,259 --> 06:48:14,299
you get the ball back after every score every play that goes by without a score decreases

1917
06:48:14,299 --> 06:48:20,659
the points from a touchdown by one dirty hits unleashed hits and injuries all add points to

1918
06:48:20,659 --> 06:48:26,220
your score that's pretty cool the helmets are off and the hits are twice as painful leading

1919
06:48:26,220 --> 06:48:32,060
to tons of injuries this prison ball no kickoff no first downs in a shortened field

1920
06:48:32,939 --> 06:48:47,939
uh let's take the helmets off and just fucking around it doesn't really matter i'll be the

1921
06:48:47,939 --> 06:48:59,479
i'll be the regular vegas team i'm just doing it for fun anyways welcome to the league so nobody

1922
06:48:59,479 --> 06:49:14,200
has a helmet so this is kind of this is prison ball without being a prison do the

1923
06:49:14,200 --> 06:49:19,240
astex have perfect stats i think they are one of the only teams that have uh perfect

1924
06:49:19,240 --> 06:49:25,270
stats and maybe not perfect but good enough where it looks like that i think there was

1925
06:49:25,270 --> 06:49:39,369
like one of the team that was like that good evening ever no helmets our first injury the game

1926
06:49:39,369 --> 06:50:14,340
turns off make it count first down and 30 oh well thanks for coming to the stream

1927
06:50:18,020 --> 06:50:26,299

06:51:15,060 --> 06:51:23,799
tomorrow somebody else got fucking hurt and i didn't do anything people are just breaking

1934
06:51:23,799 --> 06:51:42,069
legs and shit hey just look i'm not even controlling the game yeah i gotta there's a

1935

1938
06:52:10,389 --> 06:52:15,349
to do this like two weeks ago and i just didn't and i keep saying i'll do it next week i'll do

1939
06:52:15,349 --> 06:52:19,029
it next week i have to do it i gotta just pick a day or two and do it and it's tomorrow

1940
06:52:19,029 --> 06:52:32,939

1941
06:52:33,740 --> 06:52:50,700
thank you for joining me i will do my best at any rate what do you say we go through the

1942
06:52:50,700 --> 06:53:06,860
bits that came in earlier now let me get this turned off uh dropping frames but it's okay so

1943
06:53:06,860 --> 06:53:12,889
early we had demonic cucumber at two dollars earlier or three dollars actually they say a lot

1944
06:53:12,889 --> 06:53:24,979
of complications doing taxes for a dead guy and just admit it auto ate shito no that didn't

1945
06:53:24,979 --> 06:53:34,009
happen so this is more shitty and more complicated rugby american football is kind of like rugby

1946
06:53:35,189 --> 06:53:45,610
except they wear helmets and there's a lot less kicking the ball that happens a lot in rugby

1947
06:53:45,610 --> 06:53:54,939
doesn't it question on taxes do i have to do anything specific to explain randomly getting

1948
06:53:54,939 --> 06:54:00,630
like two thousand dollars it's all income that's all i have to claim it all on top of that

1949
06:54:00,630 --> 06:54:09,419
moving across the country is i think i have to file separate returns and my taxes it's not as

1950
06:54:09,419 --> 06:54:15,900
simple as just opening up turbo tax and being like okay this this this this like expenses

1951
06:54:15,900 --> 06:54:22,950
and because it's all 1099 i don't have like a w2 so it's always like a full two-day process

1952
06:54:22,950 --> 06:54:35,750
to get it all done so taxes for boston and taxes for vegas yeah because i moved

1953
06:54:37,259 --> 06:54:42,569

1955
06:54:52,470 --> 06:54:55,189
self-employment out here is a pain in the ass for taxes it is but

1956
06:54:56,150 --> 06:55:02,150

1999
07:01:24,659 --> 07:01:27,939
his character was going to change and he was going to turn into cadet carrot

2000

2003
07:01:57,400 --> 07:02:03,799
playing it and made a goal to 100 both games and it took about 76 hours but i did it just

2004
07:02:03,799 --> 07:02:10,200
a few hours ago hotline miami 1 was easy but hotline miami 2 made me beat the already hard

2005
07:02:10,200 --> 07:02:16,380
game on hard mode in a plus every level thanks for listening to my brag you one of my

2006
07:02:16,380 --> 07:02:30,299
favorite streamers that's hard to do 76 hours congratulations that's that is a gamer achievement

2007
07:02:30,299 --> 07:02:35,159
i'm okay with just beating the game because my god going back and doing those on hard

2008
07:02:38,099 --> 07:02:47,639
that will be in i i don't think i could do it so anybody that can hell yeah that's awesome

2009
07:02:48,279 --> 07:02:54,779
still never did the idea i didn't do shrek you're right and i promised i was going to

2010
07:02:54,779 --> 07:03:01,639
open with shrek i'm full of empty promises aren't i hey creation of the cyborg thanks

2011
07:03:01,639 --> 07:03:05,240
for the one dollar hey germa just found out that in 4.4 billion years the sun will explode

2012
07:03:05,799 --> 07:03:11,580
meaning every planet except for pluto will be vaporized but we won't even be alive to see

2013
07:03:11,580 --> 07:03:21,689
that because in two million years mercury will crash into earth i'm scared uh i don't think

2014
07:03:21,689 --> 07:03:28,979
we're gonna last two million years i would be surprised if we made it like another fucking 30

2015
07:03:29,619 --> 07:03:36,630
you know what i mean i'd be surprised if we made it like another fucking 200 years

2016
07:03:44,709 --> 07:03:53,400
don't you watch star trek we'll be fine that's nile that's a nihilist

2017
07:03:53,400 --> 07:03:58,729
no i'm just saying like two million years we don't even know what happened to the

2018
07:03:58,810 --> 07:04:07,799
fucking mayans how they were around for a long time the dinosaurs gone they were around for

2019
07:04:07,799 --> 07:04:22,409
what like fucking million years two million years is a long time what killed the dinosaurs

2020
07:04:22,409 --> 07:04:30,889
i don't know probably some kind of fucking fluid that they were inhaling that would be my guess

2021
07:04:47,259 --> 07:04:55,939
it's water yeah the ice age the whole planet got real cold okay but if that was possible

2022
07:04:57,779 --> 07:05:03,380
oh you know uh well the dinosaurs were around and then the whole earth turned into an ice cube

2023
07:05:03,380 --> 07:05:09,590
for a million years you don't think that could happen again you don't think we'd go into like

2024
07:05:09,590 --> 07:05:25,259
a a dark souls fucking light the flame scenario that's possible who knows in 500 years we've got

2025
07:05:25,259 --> 07:05:31,459
all kinds of potential global warming crises the dinosaurs might come back they're probably

2026
07:05:31,459 --> 07:05:36,169
still buried that you know we how far can we dig into the earth global warming is going

2027
07:05:36,169 --> 07:05:43,740
to make the dinosaurs that were buried in ice 500 meters below the earth's surface it's going

2028
07:05:43,740 --> 07:05:47,099
to melt those ice cubes you ever see you ever see jurassic park with the mosquitoes in the ice

2029
07:05:47,099 --> 07:05:52,060
cube imagine 50 fucking trillion super mosquitoes all melting because of global goddamn warming

2030
07:05:52,700 --> 07:06:02,389
and they're all going to come up and suck all your blood you know how cold it is in the

2031
07:06:02,389 --> 07:06:13,479
center of the earth it's like 12 celsius no like negative five celsius they tell you it's

2032
07:06:14,439 --> 07:06:21,669
bullshit no no no no there's not it's not hot in there the whole earth is just a giant ice cube

2033
07:06:21,669 --> 07:06:55,659
that's gonna melt that's why wine are in cellars yet somebody gets it that's why

2034
07:06:55,659 --> 07:06:59,659
when it's 90 degrees outside and you go down the lower level in your house go in your

2035
07:06:59,659 --> 07:07:03,740
basement it's much cooler down there you're gonna get closer to the earth's center ice cube

07:09:16,340 --> 07:09:20,419
i can't tell you i'm never gonna play it ever again but i am gonna tell you don't expect

2051
07:09:23,590 --> 07:09:34,180
watch me turn it on next stream but thank you snooze and copter thank you so much thank you

2052
07:09:34,180 --> 07:09:41,159
nile arian for the one dollar so this is basically the xfl it is kind of the xfl except

2053
07:09:42,360 --> 07:09:46,970
people are people get very hurt in this game you'd hope that they wouldn't

2054
07:09:46,970 --> 07:09:52,200
in real life right but thank you thank you lazy look for the one dollar will you change

2055
07:09:52,200 --> 07:09:57,799
your bits threshold in your settings to 300 so that we can't donate bits that won't be

2056
07:09:57,799 --> 07:10:04,040
red new people could be disappointed if their bits aren't red no because then that means that

2057
07:10:04,040 --> 07:10:12,520
nobody can ever give any anything below three dollars and at the end of the day bits are

2058
07:10:12,520 --> 07:10:17,099
another form of support right whether you subscribe to the channel or if you give

2059
07:10:17,099 --> 07:10:21,180
bits of 15 cents 20 cents i see people they give it all the time people give it all the

2060
07:10:21,180 --> 07:10:26,630
time so i wouldn't want to make it impossible for someone to give me less than three

2061
07:10:26,630 --> 07:10:35,720
dollars because i don't want the threshold because then at that that at that point

2062
07:10:35,720 --> 07:10:40,119
instead of just reading you're not allowed to give me money unless it's three bucks

2063
07:10:41,270 --> 07:10:48,009
which the purpose of you know all these you know subs and bits in the first place are for

2064
07:10:48,009 --> 07:11:14,220
someone to want to support the channel 50 tall and minimum incoming no yeah that was a

2065
07:11:14,220 --> 07:11:16,540
lot of back and forth with trying to figure out how that was going to happen

2066
07:11:17,259 --> 07:11:25,909
but they had to be something had something had to be done because as we all know some of these

2067
07:11:25,909 --> 07:11:32,520
end of the stream sometimes there's hundreds of messages hundreds of donations that the

2068
07:11:32,520 --> 07:11:36,840
stream can go on after the stream is technically over and we sit here for like another hour or

2069
07:11:36,840 --> 07:11:41,659
two hours or whatever it's going to get to a point where it's just not feasible to sit here

2070
07:11:41,659 --> 07:11:48,340
for like four or five hours plus and i'd like to get in front of it rather than try to

2071
07:11:48,419 --> 07:12:04,630
catch up to it potentially later just talk like an auctioneer well that's another thing i've seen

2072
07:12:04,630 --> 07:12:09,180
people talk about well why don't you just hurry up then and read them i mean that's not the

2073
07:12:09,180 --> 07:12:14,020
point of why i want to do this it would be really easy for me to go like this hey lazy

2074
07:12:14,020 --> 07:12:17,540
luke thanks for the one dollar uh change your bitch to 300 now thanks man hey nile lawyer

2076
07:12:20,819 --> 07:12:24,340

2077
07:12:24,340 --> 07:12:31,830
a man i don't want to do that i mean at that point i'm just at that point i'm just reading them

2078
07:12:31,830 --> 07:12:38,569
because they're here instead of giving attention to as many of them as i can and talk about things

2079
07:12:38,569 --> 07:12:43,130
and hang out and it's more fun that way for me i don't just want to have it be a thing

2080
07:12:43,130 --> 07:12:53,860
that i'm just phoning in and reading just because they're here so i like to give each

2081
07:12:53,860 --> 07:12:58,340
message at least some attention and yeah some of the jokey ones that people give and

2082
07:12:59,139 --> 07:13:01,939
they'll say something ridiculous and i'll just be like all right and i'll kind of just

2083
07:13:01,939 --> 07:13:15,080
keep going but for the most part i like to give each one like a full my full attention show

2084
07:13:15,080 --> 07:13:31,029
feet really that's your that's the response from the one guy there anyways uh that's gonna

2086
07:13:36,419 --> 07:13:41,540
people time to know that it was gonna happen and like last time it's still gonna be a

2087
07:13:41,540 --> 07:13:45,459
process to for people to understand that that's happening but i wanted to give at

2088
07:13:45,459 --> 07:13:50,680
least a couple weeks two or three weeks for people to figure it out right but thank you

2089
07:13:50,680 --> 07:13:57,270
lazy luke and hey thanks nile aureon for the two dollars here they did say dig up robbie so he

07:13:57,270 --> 07:14:01,590
can run it in one last time and dig up mims so he can run the field one last time

2091
07:14:02,790 --> 07:14:13,419
mims was on the field mims was on the field we got rid of robbie because robbie got his

2092
07:14:13,419 --> 07:14:20,169
leg spine broken and we replaced him with another guy who got injured every other game

2093
07:14:20,169 --> 07:14:28,630
but was the best player in the league so you know that's just the way it is a hunter force

cyborg for the one dollar hey german just got news that on the second of april google plus is

2113
07:17:08,150 --> 07:17:16,200
shutting down uh all the posts you've ever had on google plus will be gone uh stop by google

2114
07:17:16,200 --> 07:17:24,439
plus and see the end um the only reason why i had google plus in the first place is because

2115
07:17:24,439 --> 07:17:31,500
it was forced on me by youtube i had to connect my account to google plus and it just sat

2116
07:17:31,500 --> 07:17:42,860
there rotting i don't think i ever used it i remember they that was so desperate what the

2117
07:17:42,860 --> 07:17:52,060
hell were they thinking attaching every youtube account had to parasite into their body into

2118
07:17:52,060 --> 07:18:03,639
their channel google plus it was a requirement what were they thinking i don't know and now

2119
07:18:03,639 --> 07:18:15,560
the thing is shutting down that's kind of unbelievable but if you do use it sorry that

2120
07:18:15,560 --> 07:18:19,900

2153
07:22:25,180 --> 07:22:28,540
stream but i want you to know that your content seriously means a lot to us all

2154
07:22:28,540 --> 07:22:32,459
the fact that we can have this back and forth is a testament to how approachable and

2155
07:22:32,459 --> 07:22:36,459
compassionate you are i don't think anyone in this chat room would ever seriously wish to

2156
07:22:36,459 --> 07:22:44,139
upset you from all of us to your heart i don't believe that either and that goes both ways i

2157

don't want to piss people off i want you to have fun and i want us to all enjoy the streams and

2158
07:22:52,330 --> 07:22:59,369

2159
07:22:59,369 --> 07:23:06,569
to make somebody angry i hope it's not the same way on your end thank you so much though

2208
07:29:20,009 --> 07:29:35,380
obligation to me you know what i mean if you find it necessary to want to give money to this

2209
07:29:35,380 --> 07:29:47,220
channel thank you but it's not an obligation the only obligation in this chat is to repeat

2211

hanging on thank you convo breaker thanks for the one dollar speaking of bit reading

2212
07:30:03,459 --> 07:30:07,299
minimums i wanted to put this in before the minimum was raised could you make the minimum

2213
07:30:07,299 --> 07:30:12,259
250 instead of three buying in multiples of five is easier than buying in multiples of three and

2214
07:30:12,259 --> 07:30:17,419
it would keep from awkward buying two different sets of bits also please play pirate at some

2215
07:30:17,419 --> 07:30:25,849
point it's a choose your own adventure game with airbud must be fair they're from pretty

2216
07:30:25,849 --> 07:30:33,639
bad memes in here i don't know about that there's some decent ones but um i'll be

2217
07:30:33,639 --> 07:30:40,229
honest with you the reason why i picked three is because that's like what that's what a lot

2218
07:30:40,229 --> 07:30:49,099
of people have aren't a lot of most streams have like three 350 for a minimum that's just kind of

2219
07:30:49,099 --> 07:30:55,419
the way i just was like i guess that's what people do right is there a reason why that is

2220
07:30:56,060 --> 07:31:23,319
people do 420 250 the reason is three is between one and five let me let me look

2221
07:31:23,319 --> 07:31:38,860
into this because that that's not i'm i'm open to suggestions for sure set the minimum

2222
07:31:39,180 --> 07:31:54,069
i come back you know i'm gonna make a 10 i was thinking 25 because you guys said yeah two and

2223
07:31:54,069 --> 07:32:02,819
five two fifth like 25 22.5 yeah i'm gonna let let me have an internal conversation with myself

2224
07:32:02,819 --> 07:32:07,959
and ask if let me let me ask around for a little bit i i see that as a perfectly

2225
07:32:08,599 --> 07:32:16,169
perfectly reasonable compromise so we'll we'll talk about this again in another couple days

2226

2250
07:35:38,740 --> 07:35:46,490
it's great uh daffy jones thanks for the ten dollars right now daffy jones mr streamer thank

2251
07:35:46,490 --> 07:35:51,049
you for bringing all of us the laughs and happiness but i have to ask why do you always

2252
07:35:51,049 --> 07:35:58,169
stream naked or shirtless are you some kind of nudist hippie no no i'm not i don't have

2253
07:35:58,169 --> 07:36:05,130
any system of beliefs as to why i'm doing this there's only it's a biological reason

2254
07:36:05,770 --> 07:36:13,130
it's because when i sit down and i'm just hanging out i just sweat i just perspire

2255
07:36:13,130 --> 07:36:17,770
and there's nothing i can do about it it's not unhealthy it's it's not a bad thing i've actually

2256
07:36:17,770 --> 07:36:24,979
talked to doctors about it's like yeah you're a little sweaty only in certain places and i just

2257
07:36:24,979 --> 07:36:28,259
if i sit here with a shirt on if i take a shower and then come and sit down here and i'm

2258
07:36:28,259 --> 07:36:33,479
just sitting here i would just sweat through that shirt so i said you know what fucking

2259
07:36:33,479 --> 07:36:47,020
whatever why would i do that i've told this story a bunch of times but i can put on a

2260
07:36:47,020 --> 07:36:55,860
pair of sneakers get on some like tech gear i could in jeans i could in a pair of jeans

2261
07:36:55,860 --> 07:37:05,060
and a sweater run five miles and one drop of sweat will not come out of my body it's sitting

2262

2270
07:38:06,860 --> 07:38:13,209
of the glue man shirt because it was available for so long and the other they're all unisex

2271
07:38:13,209 --> 07:38:17,819
shirts but i kind of i don't know i kind of didn't want to like overwhelm everybody

2272
07:38:22,009 --> 07:38:25,290
with like four pieces of merchandise so i was like oh the glue man shirt was available

2273
07:38:25,290 --> 07:38:29,770
before but it wasn't available in a women's cut so i'll put a women's cup for the glue man shirt

2274
07:38:29,770 --> 07:38:35,209
and then this shirt is just a unisex shirt kind of like i did last time and then i'm sure i

2275
07:38:35,209 --> 07:38:52,119
probably will but it that's not a hard thing to do make a hat i actually can make hats

2276
07:38:54,569 --> 07:38:59,299
i have a lot of options but i don't want to overwhelm people with new merchandise

2277
07:39:00,020 --> 07:39:05,720
it's like oh i got two new i got the shirts are back like one week later and there's phone
