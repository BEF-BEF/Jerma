1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,780
Alright, let's get let's get one thing straight before I've seen a lot of pogchamps. I'm seeing a lot of venus's

2
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:13,960
I'm seeing a lot of before you pogchamp. This ain't even real. This is an uploaded video

3
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,000
I want to make sure you're aware of that before we get started. I have a super

4
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:27,980
Streamer switch which if there's an internet problem for more than four days a video is uploaded and broadcast as if it was live

5
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:36,200
I'm currently crying in bed tears are streaming down my face because the internet problem has still not been fixed

6
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:44,759
So hopefully this little tidbit of content will be worth a little bit for you. Can you hear me crying?

7
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,840
Well, you can because this is recorded

8
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:54,299
How is everybody?

9
00:00:54,299 --> 00:01:03,049
Alrighty, no, we are live. This is live. This is real, but i'm gonna be really honest with you

10
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:09,909
I haven't even tweeted this this is a let's see if it can stay on kind of moment here

11
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:19,109
I don't believe you. I i'll start reading names two two one one one one

12
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:28,519
Thanks for the comment there six two one one two one three three. Thanks for that comment

13
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:34,579
It's a good one. This is pre-recorded says

14
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:54,230
One two two two one one one zero zero. Thank you. Nobody said that now. How you guys doing?

15
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:59,719
I'm turning into a goblin. I really am

16
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,689
We're gonna relax for a minute here and I i'm not gonna turn the webcam on because I look like shit

17
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:17,669
You want to see a goblin? Would you like to i'm not sure if i'm like comfortable

18
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:21,610
This is like this is essentially me turning the webcam on and naked

19
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:28,819
I haven't i haven't looked in the mirror in like seven hours. I have no idea

20
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:31,849
I have dog hair all over me

21
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,250
It probably looks like such a psycho

22
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:35,930
All right. Are you ready?

23
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,930
All right. Fine. Are you ready? Let's see

24
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,879
Let's see. Well, I don't know what I look like. I have no idea

25
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:47,900
full screen

26
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,530
one

27
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,979
two

28
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:53,990
Three no, I look okay

29
00:02:54,659 --> 00:03:00,439
Look at this look at like I have so much dog hair all over me. Oh, I know I oh no, I look bad

30
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:08,169
I look okay

31
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:10,169
I just look a little a little tired though

32
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,090
um

33
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,009
Not lipstick not this time. See

34
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,210
Um, i'm very tired

35
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:20,469
It's been a long three days

36
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,550
All right. Now let's get this off because I really am turning into like a fucking goblin

37
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:28,069
Am I wearing eyeliner?

38
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,159
No

39
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:33,800
I don't think so unless somebody put it on me

40
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,449
Well, I was like going just like this at the wall

41
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:44,330
I was like a stone person

42
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,650
No, this is just like i'm just like flush

43
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:54,280
But i'll give you the long and short of it. We've been dealing with this for three days now

44
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:58,520
I was up at seven o'clock this morning. I slept for like three hours

45
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,080
I've been trying to be on top of this shit

46
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:05,419
Get at it get at it

47
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:06,550
uh

48
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,550
And i've got some we got some

49
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,270
bad news

50
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:18,120
Bad news, it's not really bad news as much as it's just

51
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:21,589
I mean, it just

52
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:25,110
Sucks, but whatever

53
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,389
um

54
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:28,389
It's kind of like too long

55
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:35,060
It really is you know, like something's just too long to even talk about it anymore. I've been talking about this for less like

56
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,269
34 hours

57
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:40,069
so

58
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:42,470
I'd be tell you okay, you know when to go around at a

59
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:44,870
family get-together

60
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,230
And it's like let's say there's like 30 or 40 people there

61
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:52,410
And every single person that you talk to you have to tell the same story to

62
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:55,379
Hey, so

63
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:57,000
hey

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,199
Johnny

65
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,720
How's your school? You're an engineering student, right? What's that like?

66
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,009
well, um

67
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:09,769
Yeah, I was an engineering student. I you know, I work on engineering and uh, i'm making a i'm making this new plane

68
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,529
of architecture

69
00:05:11,529 --> 00:05:16,410
And uh, i'm i won a award for it in the in the school paper and oh wow

70
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,050
Good to see you

71
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,050

00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:25,050
Oh, it's you johnny. How it's you it's me aunt etna

73
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:31,610
You're in school, right? Yeah. Yeah in school. Oh as an engineering student that must be

74
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,600
That must be really interesting

75
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:40,579
Yeah, what are you gonna do? What are you been doing? Um, well, I uh, yeah, I got an award

76
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,620
I've got an award. I was working on this new plane thing plane. Wow. That's incredible

77
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:47,860
Tell me more

78
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:53,139
Uh, I got an award for i'm an engineering student. It's been you know, I the the food though the school food

79
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:57,139
Oh, it's kind of stinks, right? Right, grandma. Uh, yes

80
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:03,529
Oh, you're so smart. You're the smartest one and you keep going uncle lou

81
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:11,620
Hey, how are you johnny? I I mean I heard somebody told me, you know through the night that you're an engineering student

82
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,779
Yes, I am an engineering student. Oh, what's that? You must work on planes

83
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,800
Yeah

84
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:31,100
Yeah, I work on airplanes lou. Oh, wow. Have you won any awards? I've been doing that for three days

85
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,240
Tell us again

86
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:45,449
Save it for three days

87
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:48,220
Yeah, and I actually like

88
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:53,899
I I like time looped myself too, by the way, this is important because we're just hanging out right on you hearing this

89
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,620
So here's how I time looped myself

90
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,579
so

91
00:06:57,579 --> 00:06:59,579
A person from maintenance was here

92
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,899
this morning, right

93
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:05,019
and I

94
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:10,860
There was a bunch of bullshit. It turns out there's like a saturated node, you know, i'm an engineering student

95
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:13,339
I work on airplanes, you know the blah blah blah, right?

96
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,500
so

97
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,939
He gives me the idea. Hey, you should get a static ip address

98
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,660
that will probably that maybe that'll help you with traffic and

99
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,699
um, you know, I got an award for an award for my airplane design

100
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:28,939
So I call up

101
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:30,939
the cox tech support

102
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:33,509
To try to get a static ip

103
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:35,990
So the guy on the phone

104
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,569
Is telling me oh, yeah, we're having problems issuing you this static ip

105
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:43,129
uh, it's

106
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:49,420
No, I can't talk right now. I don't want to talk about my engineering degree anymore. This is damn again

107
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:51,500
No

108
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,740
I'm not answering. I'm not talking about my engineering degree anymore

109
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:55,829
so anyways

110
00:07:55,829 --> 00:07:57,750
static ip

111
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,350
They're telling me that they can't do it. There's a problem. There's like an issue with the static ip

112
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:04,149
And i'm like, what do you mean? What's an issue? Oh my god, what's happening?

113
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,230
Uh, fuck

114
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,470
I can't answer this on stream. That's not cool

115
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,879
What if they were like quick?

116
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:17,560
We're detecting router levels of over 400 degrees

117
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,800
Tell me where you what do you what do you do for work at school?

118
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:25,079
I got engineering. Yeah. Yeah

119
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:34,809
The router

120
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:43,190
anyways, uh the

121
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:48,299
The engineering student that talked no, i'm not doing the webcam. I look like fucking trash

122
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,740
I'm gonna mute the volume for now and keep the music background music's nice

123
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:55,539
So static ip, right just listen listen

124
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,929
They tell me

125
00:08:57,929 --> 00:09:01,049
There's a problem here with your static ip if the phone rings again, I swear to god

126
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,289
No, it didn't so the static ip

127
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:11,450
Could not go through and the guy couldn't figure out why so he told me well, hold on a minute here. I

128
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:16,840
I actually see there's an outage in your area. I was like really

129
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:18,759
What are you talking?

130
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:19,879
Yeah, yeah

131
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:24,120
It looks like uh, this is probably what's going on with the static ip. Oh, you're getting packet loss here

132
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,759
There's somebody's going to be out there to uh fix that

133
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,600
There's an outage and i'm sitting there going

134
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,720
No, that's that's me

135
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,600
I i'm going like a full-on go back in time time loop scenario

136
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,279
Where like I was the one that had the guy come out?

137
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,080
to try to fix the packet loss

138
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,639
And the guy thought it was an outage in the area

139
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:54,460
But he's talking to the person that like caused the guy to come down. So I I didn't even say anything

140
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,789
I was like, oh wow

141
00:09:56,789 --> 00:09:59,350
Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah, I think there's something wrong with the line

142
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:02,379
Yeah, I mean

143
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:03,740
Got an award

144
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:11,320
For that so as it stands right now, we're switching to a static ip and it's maybe gonna help

145
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,879
but the super duper long

146
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,429
sad story is

147
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:22,309
It's not gonna fix the problem because we have like a saturated node and it's gonna take them

148
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:26,980
Uh, this is not a joke. I'm not kidding. This is real

149
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:32,889
It's gonna take them

150
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:34,889
10 years to fix it

151
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,350
It's gonna take 10 years

152
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:46,149
Yeah, well, you know, we're working all this stuff and uh

153
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:52,870
The plan is to have it all done in 10 years to like replace all the nodes and stuff and i'm like wow 10 years

154
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,480
At least my children will have good internet

155
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,159
No, no, no the static ip might work

156
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,129
In fact, we haven't dropped any frames so far. It's just all over the place

157
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:10,730
There's nothing I can do about it. So the real end of the story to move on and we're gonna play garden flipper

158
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:13,659
If you were curious

159
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:18,539
is vegas has done a lot of development in the last year like before

160
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:26,250
Um before we got here it they've dialed it up to a thousand fiber is now starting to become

161
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,970
Oh my god. Why did I just say it?

162
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:33,129
Why did I just say that

163
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:45,350
I don't know what happened man. All I all I picture is like, okay, you know like the cartoon

164
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:49,269
like in the in the cartoon with a guy like if somebody has like like

165
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:54,950
Like the charcoal all over their face and their hair is out like this and they're like like kind of dirty

166
00:11:55,669 --> 00:12:00,070
All I picture is like that guy like with like frayed out air and like the loony tunes like

167
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:03,190
I don't know man. I I pressed a couple of wrong buttons

168
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,639
400 degrees

169
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:12,759
See in 10 years

170
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:20,470
No, but it also might have been like all the water all the rain that vegas has had but to we'll put a cap on this

171
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,210
Fiber is coming out here

172
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:28,490
It's coming everywhere. There's a ton of new development and even if it means that I have to move

173
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,100
Like down the street

174
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,340
That's not a problem. That's not a big deal and you do what you got to do

175
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:42,519
Just move down the street to get fiber

176
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:49,029
That is a very real possibility if we keep having problems, right? Let's

177
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:54,019
Look, I am not going to be the one to tell you just move

178
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:00,570
but moving

179
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:06,309
Right down the street to get fiber or to make sure that it's there on like some of these newer developments

180
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:09,509
So where there's there's like hundreds of them. They pop up everywhere

181
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:15,980
All over the whole entire like las vegas valley everywhere and that the guy told me

182
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:19,820
All these huge new developments that they're going all over the place here in vegas

183
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:24,250
They're all gonna have fiber laid out there and i'm like, oh, all right. Well, maybe i'll look

184
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:30,120

194
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:04,070
So

00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,620
Here we go

196
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,059
Uh, what we're gonna do today is we're gonna see how long we can be live for

00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:15,509
we're gonna get the static ip change over tomorrow, hopefully that helps and

198
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:18,309
They are going to monitor us

199
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:22,789
And just make sure that nothing really major happens, but you know, whatever like you can't

200
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:30,519
Life's too short life's too short to pay premium internet prices for internet that will be installed in 10 years. What's going on?

201
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:38,279
What's going on?

202
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:43,720
No, no. Oh, you guys are like scared. Okay. I might be like overtired. You guys just scared the shit out of me

203
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,500
I thought that was like somebody in my room

204
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,110
What's happening? What did I say?

205
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,529
I'm sitting here going

206
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:01,289
This is somebody like gonna like strangle me behind me. Why would that happen?

207
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,720
Uh, oh monga ish

208
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,210
But we're just gonna chill we're gonna hang out

209
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:21,860
Uh, we'll see how long we can go. Um, this might not be a very long stream. I'm sorry

210
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:24,179
but you know, sometimes

211
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:25,700
it's

212
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,700
What is it? Let's go through the stages

213
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,309
anger

214
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:32,740
denial and then

215
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,440
Super saiyan and then

216
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,860
uh out of mana then

217
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,419
uh superimpose no, uh, whatever it is

218
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,039
impose

219
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:55,799
Imposition on somebody and then denial again and then you accept your fate

220
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:03,429
I think we're pretty much somewhere in the acceptance stage denial too is real

221
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,350
But this is garden flipper. Uh, don't pay no attention to the house

222
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,450
Oh, hold on a second here

223
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,950
Look in the lower left corner

224
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:28,009
Hey Jeremy, it's me

225
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,090
I'm calling you from my home office

226
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,120
The degrees went so much higher than I originally anticipated

227
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:40,039
I was trying to fix it

228
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:44,360
And then I did like a 1980s home alone style movie thing

229
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:49,000
Or I grab the two ends of the wires and connect them and then it is explosion

230
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:06,549
Sorry, i'll get back to you. This house sucks. But who cares? We're doing gardens today. Oh, there's the laptop

231
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:10,329
I had to put it on a cool surface

232
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:17,079
It's been a long time since we've been in this game

233
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,420
crack outs

234
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:24,039
We're gonna learn how to play garden flipper a bit of gravel and a couple of bushes

235
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:27,640
Hello, I work at home in my dentist's office

00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,720
And weeds in my garden

238
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,680
Please lay some gravel on the front part of my yard to get rid of these also

239

Planting is now available

243
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,369
Oh, uh a murderer

244
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:07,299

Congratulations, you've unlocked the new tool using a garden hose will be able to water flowers fill water tanks and wash dirt outside the house

00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:41,029
Oh nice

253
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:43,190

254
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,589
What was I doing?

255
00:18:57,589 --> 00:18:59,589
Ruining all of his furniture

256
00:18:59,589 --> 00:19:01,720
Ah, that's what I thought

257
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,720
Okay. So he wanted me to pick his weeds

258
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:08,009
I got five hundred and thirty nine thousand dollars

259
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:14,579
Why did I just retire? I don't have to do this

260
00:19:16,869 --> 00:19:18,869
I got half a million dollars

261
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,009
Okay, remove weeds

262
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:30,259
He's gonna retire

263
00:19:30,259 --> 00:19:34,420
Okay, scatter the surface single colored gravel and then plant a

264
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,759
Confurious shrub

265
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:44,539
So the weeds that have the little flowers on them

266
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:49,829
Why why did somebody just say whoosh?

267
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:53,400
Whoosh

268
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,910
Did I miss a joke?

269
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,660
What's the joke?

270
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,259
Oh, I got a skill point

273
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:13,210
Faster digging with a shovel 100 faster unfolding grass from the roll

274
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:19,180
Grass comes from the ground

275
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,339
Large 2019 trimmer

276
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,009
shovel

277
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:26,009
Bushi and then coming soon

00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:33,500
High grass visible on the mini map. So we got gardener scents visible moles on the mini map

279
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,480
The streamer has never been to home depot before

280
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,859
All right. Let's get let's get this one

281
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,299
No this one

282
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:49,220
Yeah, high grass visible on the mini map so we can see what we're dealing with here

283
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:56,069
I'm gonna make this dentist's office look

284
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,910
beautiful

285
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,190
Okay, so

286
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:06,660
Okay, so

287
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:12,099
Remove weeds 71 percent. Yeah, that's perfect the plant shrubs scatter the single colored gravel

288
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,420
Can I lift this up?

289
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:23,400
I need gravel

290
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,400
single colored gravel

291
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,519
Oh

292
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:33,750
What color do we want? Uh large rocks?

293
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,819
medium rocks

294
00:21:36,819 --> 00:21:38,819
Or little rocks

295
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:44,710
At the serial this is rice. It's not rice

296
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:49,990
I'm gonna plant like a quaker oat

297
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:57,299
Rice cake in your lung. Okay, let's buy how many buy many

298
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,299
Oh, what the fuck

299
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:07,660
No, no, no, no. No, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. This is wrong. Do I have any other tools?

300
00:22:11,349 --> 00:22:15,269
Scatter. No, I have to scatter this surface. But how do I this looks terrible. How do I get rid of this?

301
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:26,940
Sell the grass

302
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,940
I don't think I can sell the grass

303
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,859
Do I have like a trimmer?

304
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:33,859
P on grass that's not gonna work

305
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:36,019
That's gonna make it worse

306
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:39,930
Because I got all the weeds

307
00:22:40,089 --> 00:22:42,089
What do you mean he actually tried?

308
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:45,799
Of course, i'm gonna try

309
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:48,279
I'm just gonna do it. Look what a dumb job. This is

310
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,640
Okay, i'm gonna just scatter it around

311
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
Is that what you want me to do?

312
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:05,190
Wait, what?

313
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:10,970
I really am just putting rice cakes in his weeds

314
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,000
Scatter the surface single colored gravel

315
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:24,259
Oh

316
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:27,460
I want to cut this is fucking me up man. I want to like cut this uh

317
00:23:31,349 --> 00:23:34,150
You know what? You didn't do it like this. You put like a tarp down underneath

318
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,960
Okay

319
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,960
I'm gonna be completely honest with you all here

320
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,880
I'm gonna be totally honest with you. Is it scatter the surface or cover the surface?

321
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:01,799
Like cover the whole surface scatter the surface

322
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:08,170
Wouldn't why wouldn't it just be cover the surface with the gravel because that's what i'm doing

323
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:20,359
It's do two tone. No, I don't care. I'm not getting paid for two tone

324
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:25,059
Two tone not yet. I was just learning

325
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:29,940
I missed a spot. I'm not getting paid to get every spot

326
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:40,950
All right. This is why is it at zero percent?

327
00:24:41,750 --> 00:25:07,990
Fuck

328
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,069
Is that why people were saying whoosh?

329
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:15,579
I like the way this looks though reminds me of the sea

330
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,839
Amos getting like sea vibes here

331
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:23,829
Like bottom of the ocean like that's like a wallpaper at the bottom of the ocean

332
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:37,450
I probably should have done square use the scroll wheel. Thank you

333
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:47,539
Appreciate the help. Okay. What does it want? That's one two colored gravel

334
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:50,099
I'm just doing this one. We already have it equipped

335
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,849
I'm just like waiting for someone to scream from outside of this house

336
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:03,420
Like from in the house

337
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,420
Lazy, this is just the tutorial mission

00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:14,420
Um, I don't think I can do that. I got a new negotiation skill, didn't I?

394
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:19,029
So this is i'm picking up where I left off it was why is my house such a piece of crap?

395
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:28,470
Didn't I have a better house?

396
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:42,500
What's going on here? I thought I had like a huge best buy house owned one sold

397
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:54,569
I I sold them all holy shit. This is almost a garden, but wait not yet

398
00:32:55,049 --> 00:33:04,460
Hold on now a house in a thicket old house with a bunker uncle's bunker

399
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:09,980
Oh, yeah, we definitely did some of these look at this place garden after house construction. This place is run down

400
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:19,289
That's the home alone movie house

401
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:21,289
All right. Well, look I got money. So

402

Oh, yeah, we did we did these we've done them. See look

403
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:33,380
I've done them. Well, let me just do it. Let me learn the tools

404
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:37,259
You need to remove the bushes

405
00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:39,019
Hey there. I have a bit of a problem

406
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:42,299
I tried to deal with weeds in my garden and got some kind of herbicide to get rid of them

407
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:46,859
Luckily just to test it out. I used it on a couple of them and quickly realized it is extremely effective

408
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:49,900
It destroyed the weeds as well as my bushes

409
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:54,380
I'm really glad it didn't spray it all over my yard. But unfortunately, I did it right in front of

410
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,460
I don't know why I thought it was gonna see my kids

411
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:00,819
Like I sprayed my kids. I was like wait what?

412
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,460
I did it right in front of the entrance

413
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:05,859
Now the plants in that area are dried up and look pathetic

414
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,289
Please wipe them out and fill that spot with some fresh grass

415
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,409
Oh, and if you could mow my lawn as well, that'd be fantastic

416
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:17,239
All right. It sounds like a plan. We're gonna get the lawn mower

417
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:26,489
You've unlocked a new tool from now on you'll be able to cut grass using a garden brush cutter

418
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:33,500
Really? All right. These are dead

419
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,820
Remove object so get rid of the shrub

420
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,440
Use the turf roll to spread the grass in the area mow the lawn. Well, let's

421
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,869

423
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,710
No, you can't

424
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:53,110
Oh, all right. So you do just have to cut the lawn

425
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:01,820
Oh, i'm not doing this. Well, i'm doing this like crap. Am I spraying the oh

426
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:10,380
No, that's just the clippings

427
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,489
That's not how that works

428
00:35:12,489 --> 00:35:15,429
It's close enough

429
00:35:15,429 --> 00:35:18,150
Okay, so the lawn still needs to be over here

430
00:35:26,659 --> 00:35:30,739
I have no idea what i'm doing. I'm not a pretty i'm not a good landscaper. I'm really good at breaking things

Can I sell these?

436
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,260
I guess not just remove right? Yeah

437
00:35:53,739 --> 00:35:55,739
Okay, so then plant the grass here

438
00:35:57,909 --> 00:36:04,019

Should it be rolling?

447
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:33,619
How do I roll it?

448
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:43,940

How far does it go?

457
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:23,449
Oh, that's so terrible looking

458
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,420
This is like two layers, whatever. They're not gonna know

459
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:36,599

460
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:38,599
Okay, that goes all the way

461
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:40,599
And then this is gonna go like this

462
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,469
No one can even see it back here

463
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:52,469
What if I just don't put it under there?

464
00:37:52,469 --> 00:38:14,869
All right, here we go. What I can't it's because this is in the way. They're not even gonna fucking know

465
00:38:18,139 --> 00:38:21,260
Yeah, fuck them. What do they care? They're not gonna even know

466
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,800
Just leave the rolls

467
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,780
This is my first job

468
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:41,099
As a landscaper

470
00:38:42,809 --> 00:38:45,079
So we're gonna go this way

00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:47,079
45 is it are they gonna get mad at me?

472
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:51,289
Fuck you. Do it yourself. No, I didn't say fuck you

473
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,039
I said

474
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:55,320
I don't care

475
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,090
That's it. There's a difference

476
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:01,420
Is that that looks like it's not even correct

477
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:07,579
Look at that. God damn it

478
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:09,820

486
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:47,849
But I don't think it is

487
00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:52,889
You see what i'm talking about?

488
00:39:52,889 --> 00:39:54,889

00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:29,610
How many I have to like pull the fence up to get this under here. That's not part of the job

495
00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:34,820
It's fine. This one's done

496
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:37,179

I have to mow the neighbor's lawn. Look at that. I'm not doing that

500
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:57,849
Yeah, me and ted have an agreement

501
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,059
My son used to do it

502
00:41:04,059 --> 00:41:07,000
But he really didn't give a shit

503
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,760
He just well, uh, by the way, i'm projecting here. This is me i'm describing

504
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,159
So when I used to get like asked to mow the lawn

505
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:16,599
My father would say go mow the lawn give it come on help out try to jump up in the yard

506
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,650
I'd be like, okay fine

507
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,730
And I'd go out there and we had a pretty big yard

508
00:41:21,289 --> 00:41:23,349
And what I would do

509
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:30,070
Is I would start in the middle. No, no, no, I would end in the middle. I would end in that

510
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:32,150
I would just do a giant circle

511
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,670
right

512
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:38,949
So I would start like on the edges and I would go like this around in a huge circle

513
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:42,519
And then I would line the tires up

514
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:47,179
With the where the you know the end of where I end so I made like a giant spiral

515
00:41:47,179 --> 00:41:49,179
So the next pass would be like this

516
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:52,489
And then like this and then like this

517
00:41:53,449 --> 00:42:09,539
Like this until you got in the middle. That's how you mow a lawn. No, it's not

518
00:42:10,099 --> 00:42:12,099
You're supposed to go like straight up

519
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:17,059
And then straight down lining up the tires. So you so you get a straight line

520
00:42:17,699 --> 00:42:26,380
The background the background the backyard used was a giant spiral and my father was pissed

521
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:35,239
and then there was a part of the yard where so the dogs went out and

522
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:39,480
There was a little section of the yard that they would go to and there was like a rock out there

523
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,280
And they peed on it and they like kind of shit out there

524
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:47,320
And I would always avoid it because I didn't want to like run over dog shit

525
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:56,039
I would like avoid because I didn't want to like go out there and like

526
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:00,840
Clean it up and then mow the lawn and my father would always be like what you missed the dog pen

527
00:43:01,909 --> 00:43:03,909
Oh, yeah, I do but it's okay

528
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:09,210
I'll get i'll get it later and he'd be like, oh my fucking shot

529
00:43:17,269 --> 00:43:20,150
Okay, is this done 48 percent. What am I missing?

530
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:29,829
Is it taking in the equation the whole thing over here?

531
00:43:30,469 --> 00:43:39,369
I can't sell the grill. That's too bad. Look in the mini map

532
00:43:39,929 --> 00:43:42,409
Yeah, it's all this shit

533
00:43:42,409 --> 00:43:46,550
But I can't get rid of this

534
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:50,940
Does this count as they don't want me to get rid of this? I don't want to okay

535
00:43:51,420 --> 00:44:03,050
All right, let's at least do this. Can I get a bigger roll of tape?

536
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:09,849
I can't make this bigger

537
00:44:09,849 --> 00:44:15,110
Big roll. Thank you. Jesus. No, wait a minute. This is too big

538
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:28,519
Waste

539
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:31,239
And throw the rest in the trash

540
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:42,710
Shit, it looks like but that's correct though. Look at see

541
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:47,179
That that decay if I click right now doesn't that look correct?

542
00:44:47,739 --> 00:44:50,550
Look at where it's lining up at the edges

543
00:44:53,269 --> 00:44:55,829
See that that's this like right in the corner there, right?

544
00:44:57,579 --> 00:45:00,380
It's from the bottom of the roll. So like this

545
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:17,139
Start from the fence

546
00:45:17,139 --> 00:45:19,139
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

547
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:23,340
stay

548
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:37,349
No, they'll figure it out. Watch this be watch this be the phone call. That is

549
00:45:38,789 --> 00:45:45,670
Mr albertson we're going to be shutting your internet out for about 30 minutes to do the static ip change

550
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:50,710
If you could do me a favor and just not use your internet stay far away from it

551
00:45:51,269 --> 00:46:04,360
Well, you'll find out in a second here. What a waste. I know but don't worry

552
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:10,150
We're gonna go down and then i'm gonna cut that

553
00:46:14,679 --> 00:46:16,679
It's all right. Just get tweezers and you pick that up

554
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,980
This is done. I'm learning still i'm just learning

555
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:23,500
Let's get the even um, let me see what the smaller one looks like

556
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,840
Look, here we go. This is a perfect little roll tape

557
00:46:39,909 --> 00:46:46,840
Why I mean it's

558
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,840
I need to like move their fence

559
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:53,539
Hey, I can't I can't sell their fence and I can't move it. So like I can't do that

560
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:58,659
I i'm sorry that you you're not gonna let me move your shit

561
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:17,369
I can't wait till I get a real lawnmower. I can't wait to show you guys

562
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:19,369
I'm gonna cut the lawn like I used to

563
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:21,690
And we can compare the two ways

564
00:47:23,619 --> 00:47:25,860
You're not gonna let me uproot your whole fence

565
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,500
No, I just need to move it

566
00:47:30,789 --> 00:47:33,909
Well, why did they decide to do this? How you can't do it like this?

567
00:47:38,139 --> 00:47:41,929
It actually looks kind of good

568
00:47:41,929 --> 00:47:44,420
Up the game audio

569
00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:59,539
How is it that's probably a little better take a dip in the pool

570
00:48:01,059 --> 00:48:03,699
Uh, that's unfortunate. It's it's called out. I can't

571
00:48:04,579 --> 00:48:16,659
It's a glass pool

572
00:48:16,739 --> 00:48:21,179
Internet what do you guys think is the next step of the internet?

573
00:48:30,789 --> 00:48:32,889
gardeners

574
00:48:32,889 --> 00:48:37,820
Gardener jesus. Oh, no, no, no that okay. Never mind. I was like, what does that mean?

575
00:48:39,739 --> 00:48:44,599
100 wireless. I don't want that

576
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:50,059
Any other like fucking boomers in this chat like actually scared of like 7g

577
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:53,849
I'm gonna start growing horns

578
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:16,630
Imagine not wanting horns and like the telecom companies will all spin it. You know what I mean?

579
00:49:17,349 --> 00:49:21,820
There'll be like a hearing

580
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:25,820
Well, you know the thing is everyone has started to grow two extra eyes

581
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,760
But now you can see twice as good

582
00:49:29,719 --> 00:49:34,070
I see that as a plus

583
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:36,389
Okay, this is what's the other percentage here right here?

584
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:49,190
97 90. All right. There it is 100 complete. I didn't have to do anything else

585
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:58,650
Oh, yeah, the the senator from new york would like to ask a question

586
00:50:00,099 --> 00:50:04,500
Yeah, uh, so we've got four eyes now, but two of them throw up blood

587
00:50:05,219 --> 00:50:09,909
Every six hours. Well, I think that's just progress, you know

588
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:27,559
We're done. That's a cool straw man

589
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:32,360
Wait, what if you had eyes that had blood coming out of them?

590
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:38,599
There were extra eyes because of 7g wireless technology. I don't think that's a straw man. I think that's a real man

591
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,599
Yeah, good to be home

592
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:55,820
This is dirty

593
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,820
What the hell is a straw man?

594
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,860
Ah, well welcome to the world of politic

595
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:05,260
That's just fucking god. I my heart hurts

596
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:23,300
Fuck come on. Oh my god. That was horrible. I did not

597
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:32,489
uh

598
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:34,489
Jesus christ

599
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:37,510
How do I stop that?

600
00:51:40,489 --> 00:51:43,050
Can I was it it was never that loud before

601
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:47,000
Wow

602
00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:01,190
Why is it getting louder? Wait, I need to try something cover your ears

603
00:52:02,329 --> 00:52:06,969
Mute the stream for a second. I'm gonna do I need to see is this gonna is it going down cover?

604
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:13,900
I'm serious, please. This is a warning with an audio warning like it might lower it because that was definitely way louder

605
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:19,269
Okay, you ready? Just i'm giving you a pure warning in five seconds. Here it comes one

606
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,030
two

607
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:22,230
three

608
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:25,449
Four

609
00:52:25,449 --> 00:52:27,449
I don't know what to do. I can never knock a wall down

610
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,320
I can never do anything with the walls

611
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,099
the master

612
00:52:45,099 --> 00:52:47,099
Yeah, but if the master turns everything down

613
00:52:48,920 --> 00:53:00,420
like

614
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:04,099
Oh, what were you saying again? What were you saying?

615
00:53:10,219 --> 00:53:12,219
Oh my god

616
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:19,320
Okay. Well

617
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:22,440
Keep a mental note. Uh, I cannot use the hammer

618
00:53:23,289 --> 00:53:28,570
And if I do I need to turn the source audio down all the way disable sound

619
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:52,329
That's unfortunate that's unfortunate that sounds like a uh, that sounds like a bug to me

620
00:53:52,969 --> 00:54:05,820
It's a known bug reset the game that I have to is it saved

621
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:08,460
I have it saved right by by progress

622
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:22,469
What about my progress?

623
00:54:22,469 --> 00:54:25,429
Uh, oh guys, I don't think I I think I may have lost my progress

624
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:31,849
Turn the in-game sound down in volume mixer and then it

625
00:54:39,179 --> 00:54:41,179
Is that gonna do it?

626
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:46,940
Let's try it

627
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:49,980
We're on the worst timeline. Why the worst timeline?

628
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,059
Is it getting louder?

629
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:02,219
I don't know man. I think I might have to type into my computer

630
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:08,039
Out on steam

631
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:09,960
I got it already

632
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:33,780
Okay, let's test it last attempt and then i'm not using this device. No, ain't no

633
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:43,590
I need everybody to do me a big favor though

634
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:48,840
Like for real when there is an opportunity for me that I need to use this

635
00:55:52,679 --> 00:55:54,840
I need to you guys have to spam chat

636
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,190
just write

637
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:59,190
Hammer sound or something. I'll forget

638
00:56:01,289 --> 00:56:05,530
And I will fill somebody watching this stream's pants with shit because of that

639
00:56:08,019 --> 00:56:12,500
No, I know now and I know I know I know I know but what about the other sounds let me make sure hold on

640
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:18,219
No, that's fine. What about this one? What about the paint sounds the tiling sounds?

641
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:21,000
How loud is this?

642
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:39,460
That's fine. It's just the hammer. Okay next garden, uh tool

643
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:43,940
playground and barbecue

644
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:46,659
Substrats for liquors instead of flowers

645
00:56:47,219 --> 00:56:51,239
What about the barbecue my daughter grows so fast

646
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,119
And she is so curious about the world around her

647
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:57,559
I would love to prepare a play corner for her in the garden

648
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:01,400
It seems to me that a swing a sandpit and a rocker will be just right

649
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:06,920
Once you get started with the garden, maybe you can also plant some shrubs for me as my wife bought them for me

650
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,000
That'd be really nice

651
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
We've already enlarged the terrace

652
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,320
But now there's so much space and not much to fill it with

653
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:15,300
uh

654
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:19,860
A brugola would be useful here also a grill and a table for the whole family

655
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:23,300
Big enough to fit all of us even the grandparents when they visit us

656
00:57:23,699 --> 00:57:25,940
Oh, and would you remove all these nettles too?

657
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:29,460
Those are the worst. I don't want my sweetie to get some burns from them

658
00:57:29,619 --> 00:57:35,079
Okay, the the first two sentences and the last two sentences removed from this email. I'm doing a service

659
00:57:35,079 --> 00:57:37,769
I'm doing a job. Tell me what you want me to do this this

660
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:56,389
I don't I don't need to I don't need this info this right here. Oh, they were big bits earlier

661
00:57:56,469 --> 00:58:04,489
Holy shit. I was too busy talking about cocks

662
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:14,900
Uh, we had 50 bucks 5 000 bits from reinville. Hopefully you're still here. Thank you reinville for the 5 000 bits 50 dollars

663
00:58:15,219 --> 00:58:15,940
They say hey germa

664
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:20,900
I'm a magic the gathering artist and your streams have kept me company during long hours of painting

665
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:27,460
Really appreciate the positive space and all the goofs keep up the funny shit and know you're appreciated ps popsicle. Germa is a

666
00:58:28,099 --> 00:58:30,260
Better piece of art than i've ever created

667
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,059
That's fucking awesome

668
00:58:35,059 --> 00:58:36,409
Wow

669
00:58:36,409 --> 00:58:40,099
magic the gathering artist

670
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:43,940
Yeah, i'm sure a ton of people in the chat would love to know some of the cards that you've worked on or done

00:59:42,489 --> 00:59:47,190
Yeah, but what if but what if it was like a big oil painting? Is that how it works?

683
00:59:51,989 --> 00:59:53,750
I need a better tool than this

684
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:56,469
This thing sucks

685
00:59:56,469 --> 00:59:59,190
Can I like back up one of those log grinders?

686
01:00:00,739 --> 01:00:04,739
And then no, but I would need to pull it up by hand. I mean, I want just like I need a blonde mo

687
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,780

I'll get it. Hey, let's all I have to do is start talking about it. All right

689
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:29,769
Large 2019 trimmer. That's the one I want

690
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:37,909
That's it, right? Ooh

691
01:00:37,989 --> 01:00:39,989
That's a much bigger radius

692
01:00:45,619 --> 01:00:48,300
Take down those weeds

693
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:50,300
Ain't ain't no corn growing on those

694
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,360
Because it kind of looks like corn stalks

695
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:08,579
Somebody whatever speaking of which I I would long corn

696
01:01:09,619 --> 01:01:13,059
I would long maze. I don't think I would put that in a short sale

697
01:01:13,699 --> 01:01:16,139
I feel like it's gonna really boom here some

698
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:28,309
All right. So now we got uh, there's still weeds over here

699
01:01:28,949 --> 01:01:31,380
I'm not planting those yet. Look at all this crap

700
01:01:32,019 --> 01:01:44,059
All right. Let me see the mini map

701
01:01:44,059 --> 01:01:46,059
That is just I need to plant

702
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:49,130
Where's the rest of this?

703
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:52,170
Uh, it's over here. Look at all. I missed all this. What a terrible gardener

704
01:01:55,429 --> 01:01:57,989
Have you has this person ever been out here before?

705
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:09,820
How long have you lived here?

706
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:12,780
Those are just gonna grow back. I know you got to get in there and rip up the roots

707
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:19,079
By hand that'll spread that poison shit on them

708
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:22,860
Get in there and rip them up get the roots

709
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:27,510
Okay, there's still weeds. Where are these last weeds?

710
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:38,070
Well, let's plant this

711
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:40,070
I would say to rip them up with your teeth

712
01:02:42,659 --> 01:02:43,539
um

713
01:02:43,539 --> 01:02:45,539
No, i'm talking about no tools

714
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:58,699
Like this get out of the hands. That's good plant this one

715
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:03,780
Just use tools. You're a wuss

716
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:27,219
Don't ever call me that again

717
01:03:27,219 --> 01:03:29,619
Please only use the sledgehammer. Well, I know what

718
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:32,420
Hammer sound I didn't do it

719
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:35,750
Wuss streamer yells at his fans

720
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,579
don't ever

721
01:03:38,579 --> 01:03:58,230
Say that I i'm a wuss. That's not a very nice thing to say to somebody especially to somebody that's doing no sedation

722
01:03:58,369 --> 01:04:04,809
colonoscopy

723
01:04:04,809 --> 01:04:14,300
My wuss he's bragging about his colonoscopy

724
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:24,760
That just makes you look stupid no

725
01:04:30,739 --> 01:04:32,739
That's the hardest flex of

726
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,820
2019

727
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:40,199
Yeah, i'm gonna prove to you guys that i'm not a wuss by doing no fucking sedation colonoscopy

728
01:04:40,659 --> 01:04:42,659
And yeah, then what are you gonna say then?

729
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:51,019
Uh, we would say that's unnecessary and just take the like sedation

730
01:04:51,659 --> 01:04:54,150
Yeah, i'm not a wuss

731
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:57,269
That you're I know you're not but why you don't have to prove that

732
01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:10,300
That's coming up soon, by the way fucking colonoscopy

733
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,130
bullshit

734
01:05:15,130 --> 01:05:19,690
god dammit

735
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:23,460
too much information

736
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:25,460
I think most of the stream knows about my

737
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:27,780
my my internal health

738
01:05:28,019 --> 01:05:31,320
That's all right

739
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,719
All right. I think this is good assemble wooden child swing

740
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:38,099
Cut those bushes you wuss

01:05:44,599 --> 01:05:47,429
Where are these other weeds?

742
01:05:47,429 --> 01:05:48,949
I can't trim them

743
01:05:48,949 --> 01:05:51,110
All right. We need we need the swing sets going right here

744
01:05:58,230 --> 01:05:59,719

745
01:05:59,719 --> 01:06:01,719
wooden child swing

746
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:06,380
Try to sell him the plastic one

01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:10,219
All right. Let's see what we want. We want like a chrome finish

748
01:06:13,349 --> 01:06:14,980

749
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:16,420
frame handles

750
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:30,039
Yeah, we want like a chrome

751
01:06:30,039 --> 01:06:32,840
Ugly ugly you you ugly. It's not your swing set

752
01:06:34,039 --> 01:06:39,289
You don't have to swing on this

753
01:06:39,289 --> 01:06:45,239
Dude if it were me though, I would put

754
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,880
I would put like something right here going up

755
01:06:48,679 --> 01:06:51,000
Kind of like the head the like the hedges back here

756
01:06:51,719 --> 01:06:55,719
So you could like jump you could jump out of the swing set over into the pool

757
01:06:56,969 --> 01:06:58,969
I'll add a pool for free. That's fine

758
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:14,500
That was it. Oh, that was easy. Can I use it? Can I test it?

759
01:07:16,219 --> 01:07:17,099
Okay

760
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:25,619

761
01:07:25,619 --> 01:07:28,280
I need two of these

762
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,650
These are huge

763
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:32,650
No, don't ever get one this big

764
01:07:34,409 --> 01:07:37,019
This is too many

765
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:41,739
Put it right in the back door. So they have to like climb through sand to go outside

766
01:07:47,159 --> 01:08:13,380
That's not that big. This is really big. Okay, we're good

767
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:20,619
Too many sandboxes sandbox joke. I have a half a million dollars. I can make a joke like this

We're just gonna set up like two cameras like one here one in the bushes over there

771
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:38,520
We're gonna hide back here behind the bushes and then we're gonna watch them come out out the back

772
01:08:40,819 --> 01:08:44,979
And we're gonna like laugh hysterically when they like I don't what's happening here

773
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:47,300
God damn it

774
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:49,619
Damn it and they're gonna turn around and go back inside

775
01:08:50,260 --> 01:09:05,689
I can make that fucking joke. I got the money

776
01:09:16,409 --> 01:09:18,409
rooster spring rider

777
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:22,579
What is that?

778
01:09:22,579 --> 01:09:24,979
Rooster spring rider. Oh, it's one of these

779
01:09:25,779 --> 01:09:27,779
It's one of those like mcdonald's toys

780
01:09:27,859 --> 01:09:43,029
This is a very you get what I mean mcdonald's. This is a mcdonald. This is from mcdonald's

781
01:09:45,399 --> 01:09:47,560
Old mcdonald's play places used to have this shit

782
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:50,659
all yellow

783
01:09:50,659 --> 01:09:57,859
No, that's ugly

784
01:09:57,859 --> 01:10:04,630
That's all right

785
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:06,630
Your mcdonald's had to throw up corner

786
01:10:09,699 --> 01:10:12,180
What is what is that? What is a throw up corner?

787
01:10:12,979 --> 01:10:19,899
And then we need a cherry tree

788
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:26,199
How big does it have to be?

789
01:10:26,199 --> 01:10:30,380
It can be small right? Yeah, i'm gonna put the cherry tree back here

790
01:10:39,239 --> 01:10:45,020
Why do kids always throw up in there? Um, I don't think that's hard to decipher that

791
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:48,220
You eat a bunch of mcdonald's

792
01:10:48,939 --> 01:10:52,779
And then you run around in a play place and slide down a bunch of slides

793
01:10:53,899 --> 01:10:55,899
And get lost in like a ball pit

794
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:59,100
You that's not hard

795
01:10:59,819 --> 01:11:04,779
If you eat like a mcdonald's cheeseburger if I ate a mcdonald's cheeseburger or three of them or whatever and then slid down

796
01:11:04,779 --> 01:11:08,939
A slide I throw up when I get off

797
01:11:08,939 --> 01:11:13,560
That looks good

798
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,739
Lost in a ball pit how

799
01:11:15,739 --> 01:11:17,739
You guys never went

800
01:11:17,739 --> 01:11:20,380
Did you guys ever do ball pits? How old are some of you guys?

801
01:11:23,319 --> 01:11:25,880
Because if you were old enough to do the ball pit

802
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:29,109
At mcdonald's

803
01:11:29,109 --> 01:11:34,069
You never did the thing where you dig you dig dig dig your whole body

804
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:36,949
To a point where you are underneath all of the balls

805
01:11:38,359 --> 01:11:40,600
And you just like lie there for some reason

806
01:11:41,619 --> 01:11:46,659
And pretend like you don't exist anymore and then like the somebody like jumps in

807
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:55,819
And crushes you

808
01:11:55,819 --> 01:12:01,979
What do you mean? No one does that what you know how many times i've like bruised my shoulder and arm and leg

809
01:12:02,619 --> 01:12:07,260
Because I got hulk hogan leg drop from some random kid that didn't know I was underneath them all

810
01:12:11,989 --> 01:12:19,270
Still weeds somewhere. I'm looking at the mini-map. I don't see any other weeds. Do you see any other weeds?

811
01:12:19,829 --> 01:12:25,050
These aren't weeds

812
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:30,619
No, those aren't weeds

813
01:12:30,619 --> 01:12:38,380
Got them. There's more somewhere. There's one more this one little turd weed

814
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:43,590
You were recently in a ball pit

815
01:12:43,909 --> 01:12:46,630
No, I just remember what it was like to be in a ball pit

816
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:58,310
You guys didn't have like throw the ball pit balls at each other when you were younger

817
01:12:59,189 --> 01:13:03,859
That was original paintballing

818
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:11,829
That was like that was like nine your eight-year-old paintballing

819
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:16,659
And you leveled up to go paintballing

820
01:13:16,659 --> 01:13:24,329
You would just like get in a corner and just have a never-ending plastic snowball fight. You guys didn't do that

821
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:29,340
All right, so I need to place

822
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:31,340
two times

823
01:13:31,659 --> 01:13:33,180
Why does it say 11?

824
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:41,289
You want them on here?

825
01:13:41,289 --> 01:13:49,050
Which one is it pergola moco pergola moco?

826
01:13:50,329 --> 01:13:52,409
Oh shit this day. Oh, yeah, they want this thing

827
01:13:53,210 --> 01:13:59,020
Chrome finish

828
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:01,020
I hate these. Why do you want one of these?

829
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:09,420
It's not my house. Like so why do I care?

830
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,960
How do you put this here without it being ugly?

831
01:14:19,590 --> 01:14:22,149
Their back patio is not big enough to have this here

832
01:14:28,470 --> 01:14:32,550
Well, might as well just

833
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:34,300
Whatever

834
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:36,920
Put it right in front of the door

835
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:38,920
Yeah, but what if it rains?

836
01:14:40,119 --> 01:14:50,779
And it gets all up in there

837
01:14:50,779 --> 01:14:53,100
Oh, you don't put uh, I thought don't you drape something on this?

838
01:14:58,069 --> 01:15:09,460
Wait, they want 10 of these. Hold on. Do you how many of these do you want?

839
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:22,329
I'm confused. Hold on. Why do you want so many of these? Do you want more?

840
01:15:25,319 --> 01:15:27,319
Where am I supposed to put these?

841
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:36,710
You're gonna have to put them on the roof

842
01:15:37,609 --> 01:15:39,210
What?

843
01:15:39,210 --> 01:15:48,140
No, no

844
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:54,899
It changed. Yeah, but see oh fuck. All right good grill

Oh, I see that I get it. I see you want to have a little grill patio. Ah, nice

01:16:03,539 --> 01:16:06,229

You know what have this be back? No

856
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:40,149
Right here. Damn it. No, I hate these things. Why do you want one of these?

857
01:16:40,949 --> 01:16:42,949
I couldn't advise against that

858
01:16:43,029 --> 01:16:45,800
Why?

859
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,800
Okay. Now I need six chairs

860
01:17:01,770 --> 01:17:03,770
How do you have six chairs here?

861
01:17:06,069 --> 01:17:12,380
Why would you have this many?

862
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:16,090
Wait one two

863
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:18,810
One, two, three, four five six. You don't need this many

864
01:17:22,939 --> 01:17:25,420
How many people do you have in your family that are coming out here?

865
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:33,899
What? Huh?

866
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:52,229
You want more? This table is not big enough to have this many chairs

867
01:17:53,029 --> 01:17:55,800
Wait

868
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:57,800
Wait this did you not want this?

869
01:17:58,199 --> 01:18:10,390
You like got this online and you just you thought it was gonna be three times bigger then you want a couch eclipse a couch

870
01:18:20,859 --> 01:18:27,880
Oh

871
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:40,359
Why do you want this?

872
01:18:40,359 --> 01:18:42,520
All right, let's do grandma style. That's fine with me

873
01:18:44,949 --> 01:18:46,949
Now this is here we go grandma

874
01:18:48,060 --> 01:19:09,449
Perfect. I think we're good. No, not 100% though. What am I missing? Use the rooster

875
01:19:17,479 --> 01:19:20,199
That looks all right

876
01:19:20,199 --> 01:19:23,560
With like the grandma sleep pod which i'm gonna put down here

877
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:31,340
So something's going on over here that I missed weeds maybe

878
01:19:32,489 --> 01:19:54,310
In the front of the house. It says I got everything done. How am I not at 100%? It's the three on the map

879
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:03,029
Oh, damn. Okay two sofa

880
01:20:03,649 --> 01:20:09,409
Sami sofa

881
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:15,670
Sofa sam what is that?

882
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:27,449
It's not comfortable at all. Well, it's gonna make grandma

883
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:36,819
Now we need how many of these?

884
01:20:36,819 --> 01:20:39,380
You want more than one of those? You don't have a big enough house for this

885
01:20:47,319 --> 01:20:50,680
And then a table you don't have a big enough house. You can't have all this stuff

886
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:11,670
Got it. This person's fucked if it rains. That's what i'm saying. I felt like I was gonna put something up here

887
01:21:16,619 --> 01:21:19,100
I thought we were gonna dread. That's why I was curious of why I had somebody

888
01:21:19,739 --> 01:21:21,739
You know numbers. I thought we were gonna go

889
01:21:21,739 --> 01:21:24,170
Uh tarp or something

890
01:21:24,170 --> 01:21:26,100
That looks pretty good

891
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:27,600
cool

892
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,069
Seven thousand dollars

893
01:21:30,069 --> 01:21:37,460
Soggy table soggy chairs. That's right. This looks like shit, but it's not who cares

894
01:21:38,649 --> 01:21:40,649
I got lots of money. I just don't spend it

895
01:21:41,289 --> 01:21:47,289
I'm gonna be one of those people that just has a million dollars, but doesn't ever buy anything

896
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:53,239
You just have it you open up like your bank account and just look at it and go cool

897
01:21:58,390 --> 01:22:05,829
All right. What was this one? Hi there mommy left for a few months

898
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:09,829
When she returns, I will tell her that the flowers unfortunately rotted

899
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:12,470
Because I watered them too often

900
01:22:13,829 --> 01:22:19,510
In the meantime, you have to cut them out and plant my favorite plants quinces wine grapes, etc

901
01:22:19,989 --> 01:22:21,750
You can leave the flowers that are at the front of the house

902
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:26,149
So that won't that she won't notice anything when she returns all her flowers in the backyard have to disappear

903
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:28,149
That's my spot

904
01:22:28,149 --> 01:22:30,520
Hope you can do that. Can't you see ya?

905
01:22:32,579 --> 01:22:34,579
What the fuck is going on here?

906
01:22:36,949 --> 01:22:40,149
What kind of willy wonka chocolate room kind of shit is this?

907
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:47,479
uh

908
01:22:47,479 --> 01:22:49,479
Don't get involved in this

909
01:22:50,439 --> 01:22:53,079
Wait, what would what leave the ones at the front, right?

910
01:22:53,880 --> 01:23:04,039
This is a nice garden. No, I don't know. No, I don't like this. This gives me anxiety

911
01:23:05,159 --> 01:23:15,939
And this is like anxiety here. I don't like this. I don't it just does so I don't something about it. I don't like it

912
01:23:16,819 --> 01:23:19,939
Too much just give me one giant cactus and that's it. I don't want all this other stuff

913
01:23:20,819 --> 01:23:23,800
I feel like they're all looking at me

914
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,800
They're all like alive and shit

915
01:23:26,199 --> 01:23:37,300
I'm sorry. Okay. I mean they are alive

916
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:40,500
No, just I want one huge cactus

917
01:23:41,859 --> 01:23:45,560
and then a big aloe vera plant and

918
01:23:47,479 --> 01:23:51,430
Maybe like a couple other cactuses. So how many anyone weeds?

919
01:23:53,079 --> 01:23:55,079
Yeah, there's still weeds everywhere

920
01:23:55,079 --> 01:24:03,159
more weeds back here

921
01:24:03,159 --> 01:24:08,840
65

922
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:11,579
Eating cactus

923
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:21,859
That shit will keep you alive man weeds weeds weeds weeds weeds. This is a nice table

924
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:27,619
Those don't even look like weeds. Those look like nice flowers

925
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:32,890
Okay, almost done with that

926
01:24:35,319 --> 01:24:37,319
The hunt for weeds, you know

927
01:24:41,859 --> 01:24:55,460
Right here. Is there a weed scanner? I don't have the skill point. Well, i'll get back to it. All right

928
01:24:56,180 --> 01:24:58,260
So I need to plant two cornice

929
01:24:59,609 --> 01:25:01,609
remove weeds and then plant

930
01:25:05,670 --> 01:25:08,069
Okay, I need a a chan chan la mai

931
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:12,079
cornice

932
01:25:12,079 --> 01:25:14,079
mastis cornice

933
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:19,100
So how many you want a few of these right two of these

934
01:25:19,819 --> 01:25:22,060
Why do you want these fucking huge trees?

935
01:25:27,989 --> 01:25:29,989
Can these go over here? Yeah

936
01:25:30,939 --> 01:25:33,979
No cherry tree you want to put this over here

937
01:25:35,859 --> 01:25:37,859
What are you? What are you dumb?

938
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:40,180
What are you dumb you dumb

939
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:42,420
What are you?

940
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:58,710
Okay, and then three channel them it is

941
01:26:02,630 --> 01:26:06,090
How big are these

942
01:26:06,090 --> 01:26:08,729
These are ugly too. Why would you remove your mother's nice plants?

943
01:26:09,369 --> 01:26:20,359
I swear fucking zoomers man. I want to put this like back here

944
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:33,609
Not enough space. I'm moving this shit. There's gonna be enough space, but who cares it is a tutorial

945
01:26:35,350 --> 01:26:39,430
It is just a tutorial. It is just a tutorial. It's weird to say that

946
01:26:39,909 --> 01:26:41,909
It's like too many t's in that sentence

947
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:46,170
It's just a tutorial

948
01:26:46,170 --> 01:26:48,170
How many how many of these three?

949
01:26:48,170 --> 01:26:58,760
I'll go back here

950
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,760
Now these kind of need to be together. Don't they?

951
01:27:01,319 --> 01:27:03,319
Yeah, this looks dumb if they're not together

952
01:27:09,510 --> 01:27:11,350
Okay, and then

953
01:27:11,350 --> 01:27:13,510
That's three then three ribs

954
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:18,310
ribs r i b e s

955
01:27:18,949 --> 01:27:21,590
You know three of these wait. There was a color change there

956
01:27:23,159 --> 01:27:24,220
species

957
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:27,380
Uh, let's do

958
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:33,899
Let's do the red

959
01:27:33,899 --> 01:27:39,689
These are gonna go in the front. Why are you saying spi?

960
01:27:41,430 --> 01:27:43,029
why

961
01:27:43,029 --> 01:27:49,619
Come on, I can fit one more here

962
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:52,779
right

963
01:27:52,779 --> 01:27:54,779
Here somewhere. Come on

964
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:57,340
eyes

965
01:27:57,340 --> 01:28:04,140
All right plant

966
01:28:04,140 --> 01:28:07,189
He said the thing

967
01:28:07,189 --> 01:28:09,189
Yeah, I say the thing all the time

968
01:28:09,590 --> 01:28:14,920
I think i've said the word spi more in the last two months than I have in the last five years

969
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:29,189
He said it again

970
01:28:29,189 --> 01:28:31,189
Just pull surprises these days

971
01:28:31,350 --> 01:28:40,199
Let's plant this

972
01:28:40,199 --> 01:28:44,869
You have to say it with the voice

973
01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:47,979
No, I don't have to do that

974
01:28:47,979 --> 01:28:50,920
No, I don't gotta do it

975
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:52,439
You can do it. You try it

976
01:28:52,439 --> 01:29:05,140
I don't like the way this looks

977
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:13,270
Three then I get to plant these over here

978
01:29:13,909 --> 01:29:16,229
Let's just do the big tree

979
01:29:16,229 --> 01:29:18,229
First to get it out of the way

980
01:29:18,229 --> 01:29:26,420
It's gonna take forever to dig. Isn't it?

981
01:29:26,420 --> 01:29:28,420
How long does it take to dig a hole this big?

982
01:29:28,579 --> 01:29:36,970
I don't think i've ever dug a hole like this before every time i've ever tried to dig a hole

983
01:29:37,850 --> 01:29:40,250
I always get into that. Oh, yeah, i'm gonna dig a hole

984
01:29:40,890 --> 01:29:43,210
You get like a not even a foot down and it's impossible

985
01:29:44,010 --> 01:29:52,020
You just can't do it anymore

986
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:54,819
You like hit you hit like obsidian. It's like

987
01:29:56,500 --> 01:30:09,220
You can't go

988
01:30:09,220 --> 01:30:11,539
I don't know why it's weird. It's like it hardens up

989
01:30:16,039 --> 01:30:19,880
Rocks and shit. Yeah, I don't know how do people dig holes without a

990
01:30:21,159 --> 01:30:22,119
actual

991
01:30:22,119 --> 01:30:23,640
Device to do it

992
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:30,359
I'm you guys are strong. I'm kind of a wuss

993
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:43,079
This chat is so easy to manipulate. It's crazy

994
01:30:47,239 --> 01:30:50,439
I didn't say that somebody did it. I didn't say I didn't say that

995
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:54,250
Somebody said that and i'm just reading it

996
01:30:58,729 --> 01:31:03,260
I said it

997
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:12,250
soil

998
01:31:12,250 --> 01:31:15,210
Just say pog and we will all spam pog

999
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:20,060
Yeah, but I mean this goes both ways

1000
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:22,409
because

1001
01:31:22,409 --> 01:31:27,130
If somebody puts a fish on the end of their comment, i'm going to read it out loud

1002
01:31:27,930 --> 01:31:28,890
remember

1003
01:31:28,890 --> 01:31:36,810
So this works both ways

1004
01:31:36,810 --> 01:31:38,810
We tested that theory a while ago

1005
01:31:38,970 --> 01:31:43,590
All right, there's still weeds over here that looks all right

1006
01:31:44,630 --> 01:31:45,829
ooh

1007
01:31:45,829 --> 01:31:49,590
Well, it's no this is bad bad placement. Just cut that one down

1008
01:31:50,229 --> 01:31:59,180
All right. These are the weeds

1009
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:01,100
Come on weeds

1010
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:03,899
Oh, there's looking how much more of this shit there is. I gotta fill the pool up

1011
01:32:11,180 --> 01:32:13,579
I remember having an above ground pool

1012
01:32:15,319 --> 01:32:17,319
And this is what you did

1013
01:32:17,319 --> 01:32:22,199
You had to just put the hose in there and just let it run. It took like three weeks

1014
01:32:29,079 --> 01:32:32,520
Now these pools come assembled and they come with water in them

1015
01:32:33,079 --> 01:32:36,199
A company comes to the big truck and just dumps it in there

1016
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:48,500
It takes like 20 hours. Yes spread over like five days. You can't water that in a row like that

1017
01:32:50,619 --> 01:32:52,619
That's like that's not allowed

1018
01:32:52,619 --> 01:32:58,949
So you do like a couple gallons a day and it took like like two or three months

1019
01:33:06,810 --> 01:33:14,140
Found the weeds

1020
01:33:14,140 --> 01:33:16,140
Yeah, because if there was like a water ban

1021
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:26,329
The water police would show up

1022
01:33:26,329 --> 01:33:28,329
At that point just take a bath

1023
01:33:34,939 --> 01:33:36,939
Are you putting

1024
01:33:36,939 --> 01:33:41,670
Why does it take so long? Are you putting it through a brita filter first?

1025
01:33:42,630 --> 01:33:44,630
There's some sick fuck that does that

1026
01:33:45,109 --> 01:33:47,670
You know it I don't even have to fucking pretend. That's not real

1027
01:33:48,890 --> 01:33:53,609
There's some like weirdo that has like purified water in their pool

1028
01:33:56,090 --> 01:33:58,810
They like filter it first and then they put it in the pool

1029
01:34:04,779 --> 01:34:07,420
In case they get thirsty. Yeah, you can just go under water and just go

1030
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:18,180
It's actually kind of fucking cool

1031
01:34:18,180 --> 01:34:20,180
That's not that's actually pretty cool

1032
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:25,939
If I've had like a fucking hundred billion dollars

1033
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:28,979
I'd have a purified brita pool

1034
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:34,359
and every month

1035
01:34:34,359 --> 01:34:36,600
I would have another pool behind it

1036
01:34:37,699 --> 01:34:44,020
And then we just get a giant brita filter and then filter the water every few months and dump it into the other pool

1037
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:47,979
And then have that one cleaned. I think that's good with weeds

1038
01:34:52,170 --> 01:34:54,170
Well, wait, I just like I just cut those down

1039
01:34:54,729 --> 01:34:56,729
But those doesn't worry. Those are nice

1040
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:00,340
Oops

1041
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:02,500
All right. Now we have to do plant 10 Bacchus

1042
01:35:03,220 --> 01:35:08,439
Yeah, get these out of here

1043
01:35:08,439 --> 01:35:10,439
10 Bacchus plants

1044
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:16,220
This is gonna take a million years

1045
01:35:20,310 --> 01:35:22,760
10 of these

1046
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:34,789
three

1047
01:35:35,109 --> 01:35:46,310
I don't think I ever did any work like this before. Can I get some pogchamps in the chat, please for that?

1048
01:35:50,470 --> 01:35:53,189
Never. No, I have I have such soft

1049
01:35:54,739 --> 01:35:57,800
unused hands

1050
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:01,000
I'm the kind of person that if I pick up a bunch of sand in my hands

1051
01:36:01,399 --> 01:36:03,399
I might start to bleed

1052
01:36:07,369 --> 01:36:09,369
They're just unused

1053
01:36:11,989 --> 01:36:13,989
Now we're gonna do this in waves here

1054
01:36:14,630 --> 01:36:28,140
You need to use them much like i'm not gonna read that one, but like all right

1055
01:36:29,909 --> 01:36:38,920
Settle down

1056
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:40,920
Just all right. Let's just go for it

1057
01:36:45,779 --> 01:36:48,739
See some of you guys that have like fucking unwashed hands

1058
01:36:49,819 --> 01:36:51,319
You'll know

1059
01:36:51,319 --> 01:36:54,390
You know how long this takes to do

1060
01:36:54,390 --> 01:36:57,430
This should take doing this would take like three weeks

1061
01:36:59,579 --> 01:37:01,579
You could fill a pool in that time

1062
01:37:21,609 --> 01:37:22,970
Somebody just wrote

1063
01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:24,970
What are you talking about?

1064
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:32,680
I love it

1065
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:35,399
Local old man has no concept of time. Yes, I do

1066
01:37:36,199 --> 01:37:40,229
I was actually gonna buy a watch

1067
01:37:40,229 --> 01:37:46,229
And no, i'm not talking about i'm gonna do rolex. No, no, i'm gonna get like a walmart fucking like 1999 watch

1068
01:37:46,869 --> 01:37:55,539
An apple watch

1069
01:37:55,539 --> 01:38:01,850
No, i'm not gonna get an apple wash. I would wash my hands in the bathroom and I would it would break

1070
01:38:11,020 --> 01:38:14,539
I would seriously I would I would just forget it was on and I would wash my hands

1071
01:38:14,539 --> 01:38:16,539
And it would get the water would get all over it

1072
01:38:22,890 --> 01:38:25,050
Yeah, you have to just get one of those really really just

1073
01:38:25,670 --> 01:38:35,579
cheapo ones

1074
01:38:35,579 --> 01:38:37,579
That would happen for any other watch

1075
01:38:37,819 --> 01:38:40,380
yeah, I know, but there's a difference between a like

1076
01:38:41,159 --> 01:38:43,159
$600 watch and a

1077
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:46,140
$15 watch that if you break it you just go

1078
01:38:46,939 --> 01:38:49,670
Ah, oh well

1079
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:51,750
Instead of go. Oh, no

1080
01:38:52,470 --> 01:39:08,859
No

1081
01:39:08,859 --> 01:39:13,260
Get some water is it you could get water resistant, right? But that's too much to think about

1082
01:39:14,220 --> 01:39:19,819
I'm just gonna get the time tattooed on my like stomach so I can look down and like know what time it is

1083
01:39:20,699 --> 01:39:22,380
It's probably easier that way

1084
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:33,510
I'm gonna get them all in one go here

1085
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:47,300
That's how how cheap is the tattoo?

1086
01:39:49,300 --> 01:39:54,659
Yeah, but that okay that I make it I make that joke, but somebody somewhere has that so they can

1087
01:39:55,380 --> 01:39:56,739
at the bar

1088
01:39:56,739 --> 01:39:58,739
you know when it's like

1089
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,380
10-28 p.m

1090
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:05,539
They can lift up their fucking shirt and go 10-28 p.m

1091
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:08,500
And everyone goes like what the fuck

1092
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:11,380
Everyone's mouth curls into like that. Oh

1093
01:40:12,619 --> 01:40:13,960
and then he like

1094
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:19,020
shotguns a beer

1095
01:40:19,020 --> 01:40:21,020
Somebody out there has that

1096
01:40:21,100 --> 01:40:27,210
And it's like digital clock format too. So it's even more like oh fuck off. You know what I mean?

1097
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:41,100
That's literally me

1098
01:40:47,239 --> 01:40:49,739
That's like an interesting idea though backtracking

1099
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:55,960
I can hear it. I can feel the backtrack coming out

1100
01:40:58,279 --> 01:41:04,220
Okay, so that's done

1101
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:09,430
Nice, you didn't hear what I just said. I was like, that's like a cool idea though

1102
01:41:09,989 --> 01:41:14,199
Because somebody just said that I have that and then I got like scared. I was like, I hope he's not mad

1103
01:41:17,319 --> 01:41:19,399
Oh faster planting faster digging

1104
01:41:21,380 --> 01:41:23,380
Yeah faster planting I got two

1105
01:41:23,699 --> 01:41:29,670
Let's get the better shovel

1106
01:41:29,670 --> 01:41:34,819
What's the shovel look like? I want to see it. All right medium pear tree

1107
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:37,699
Cherry tree

1108
01:41:37,699 --> 01:41:43,020
so medium

1109
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:44,970
cherry tree

1110
01:41:45,050 --> 01:41:47,800
Need two of these

1111
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:49,800
Oh, let's let's go over here

1112
01:41:52,010 --> 01:41:54,869
Let's put the fruit together

1113
01:41:54,869 --> 01:41:56,710
You know right in the back there

1114
01:41:56,710 --> 01:42:00,149
And the other side over here

1115
01:42:00,149 --> 01:42:04,279
That's not bad placement

1116
01:42:04,279 --> 01:42:06,279
That looks I think that looks okay

1117
01:42:10,010 --> 01:42:11,850
I've never played it

1118
01:42:11,850 --> 01:42:13,539
not once

1119
01:42:13,539 --> 01:42:18,180
But I was gonna make like a okay now start dota auto chess and like have them fought. I don't know

1120
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:21,380
Somebody might be able to come up with something from there

1121
01:42:26,899 --> 01:42:28,899
They had to be over here. That's unfortunate

1122
01:42:29,380 --> 01:42:40,069
Oh, well, I got plenty of money

1123
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:45,140
Forcing chat to make your jokes for you

1124
01:42:46,020 --> 01:42:48,180
I I never said I was making it. I was just like

1125
01:42:50,039 --> 01:42:53,560
Thinking about it. It's a good shovel

1126
01:42:56,010 --> 01:42:58,010
These cherry trees aren't gonna get me sun

1127
01:42:58,409 --> 01:43:17,510
Yeah, they are why do the cherry trees look like palm trees?

1128
01:43:19,460 --> 01:43:22,060
Uh, yeah, they kind of do you're right

1129
01:43:24,069 --> 01:43:25,510
Mod that guy

1130
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:27,510
Fucking mod that guy right now

1131
01:43:27,510 --> 01:43:37,779
He's right

1132
01:43:37,779 --> 01:43:44,060
All right medium pear tree

1133
01:43:44,140 --> 01:43:48,920
Oh, this is cool

1134
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:52,359
I'm just kidding. It's not going over there everyone's but I just saw so many people

1135
01:43:53,659 --> 01:43:57,579
Like grab their monitors with both hands and rip it into their face and scream

1136
01:44:00,310 --> 01:44:02,310
Uh, let's put it right here. It's fine

1137
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:08,699
All right. We still need more the lawn two medium plum trees are gonna go one two

1138
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:14,100
medium plum tree

1139
01:44:14,159 --> 01:44:16,819
medium

1140
01:44:16,819 --> 01:44:18,020
Medium

1141
01:44:18,020 --> 01:44:20,069
Where is it?

1142
01:44:20,069 --> 01:44:21,819
medium

1143
01:44:21,819 --> 01:44:28,470
Plum tree, what the hell?

1144
01:44:28,550 --> 01:44:30,550
Medium plum tree

1145
01:44:35,369 --> 01:44:47,260
All right, let's do it this is the most boring garden placement

1146
01:44:48,260 --> 01:44:50,260
What do you mean? I think it looks good

1147
01:44:54,979 --> 01:44:59,300
Okay, it is just kind of tree tree tree tree tree tree

1148
01:45:00,420 --> 01:45:05,460
It's on the edges. You're right. This is kind of a boring placement. I told you i'm not very good at this though

1149
01:45:06,180 --> 01:45:08,180
I'm pretty good at smashing stuff with a hammer

1150
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:12,260
If you need a guy to take down a wall with a sludge hammer with anger

1151
01:45:12,819 --> 01:45:15,829
Just leave it to me. I'll take care of that

1152
01:45:16,899 --> 01:45:18,979
If you want loud sounds I can make those

1153
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:25,260
With my mouth did I get the job?

1154
01:45:25,899 --> 01:45:33,960
Okay, so that's still weeds

1155
01:45:41,109 --> 01:45:45,829
Why does it sound like static?

1156
01:45:45,829 --> 01:45:50,920
I don't know

1157
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:53,100
I have absolutely

1158
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:55,180
Idea. No, that's not how it works

1159
01:45:56,859 --> 01:46:00,439
It doesn't just stop

1160
01:46:00,439 --> 01:46:03,609
I seriously

1161
01:46:03,609 --> 01:46:07,180
everybody would just

1162
01:46:07,180 --> 01:46:09,930
It gets to a point when that the

1163
01:46:10,010 --> 01:46:12,329
Power of the devices that you power in your house

1164
01:46:12,890 --> 01:46:14,890
So if you have two sockets

1165
01:46:15,609 --> 01:46:20,149
Use the

1166
01:46:20,149 --> 01:46:35,590
Don't put anything in there. Did you guys get that nice?

1167
01:46:36,470 --> 01:46:38,470
All right. Now let's like fucking stomp

1168
01:46:41,319 --> 01:46:43,319
With like big boots on. All right. So we good

1169
01:46:44,039 --> 01:46:46,039
No, I still need to move weeds

1170
01:46:49,289 --> 01:46:51,289
Pool weeds not cool

1171
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:01,699
Where are they?

1172
01:47:01,699 --> 01:47:05,859
It's getting dark out. This task is taking me all day to complete lawn

1173
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:16,119
All right, I got the lawn mode still weed somewhere

1174
01:47:22,970 --> 01:47:26,039
Hmm. Anybody see weeds?

1175
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:28,600
Ah, no, it doesn't not weeds

1176
01:47:29,609 --> 01:47:37,220
Where are these weeds could be flowers though. I can't tell I don't see any

1177
01:47:41,369 --> 01:47:43,050
Don't ignore us

1178
01:47:43,050 --> 01:47:45,939
What do you want about?

1179
01:47:45,939 --> 01:47:48,500
This whole job was two thousand dollars. What a piece of crap

1180
01:47:50,079 --> 01:47:52,520
99 percent

1181
01:47:52,539 --> 01:47:53,420
Oh

1182
01:47:53,420 --> 01:47:55,979
Just like cox's uptime in quotes

1183
01:48:02,039 --> 01:48:06,250
That's actually what they say

1184
01:48:06,250 --> 01:48:07,770
All right. Um

1185
01:48:07,770 --> 01:48:09,449
I got a lot of bugs in my house

1186
01:48:09,449 --> 01:48:12,489
No, i'm leaving it like that. Oh, yeah that we destroy these walls

1187
01:48:18,149 --> 01:48:22,810
No, I like this stuff. I'm keeping it. All right, there might be time too. I think we know what we're doing here

1188
01:48:24,979 --> 01:48:26,500
one little thing to come

1189
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:30,819
Complete my part of heaven. I guess this is what is there any other tools that I have not figured out?

1190
01:48:35,859 --> 01:48:40,180
Buy the home alone house. Well, not yet. Hold on. I need to make sure there's any tools that I can use

1191
01:48:40,739 --> 01:48:44,979
Why is the music so the music's not scary?

1192
01:48:48,359 --> 01:48:50,680
Why is the music scary? What are you talking about?

1193
01:48:51,159 --> 01:48:55,930
I should be back home by the end of the week

1194
01:48:55,930 --> 01:48:59,449
I just need some rest when I get back and I think that the mess in my garden might make me nervous

1195
01:49:00,250 --> 01:49:01,289
See

1196
01:49:01,289 --> 01:49:06,090
You I don't even have this garden and it's fucking already making this person like nervous and have anxiety

1197
01:49:08,250 --> 01:49:11,449
I feel the same way. I want to hire your company again to put my garden or to own

1198
01:49:11,449 --> 01:49:13,449
Please take care of the lawn. It hasn't been mowed for ages

1199
01:49:20,180 --> 01:49:21,500
Dear

1200
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:23,819
All right. Okay. Hold on. Can I go in your house?

1201
01:49:24,619 --> 01:49:27,220
You want to let me go in the house?

1202
01:49:27,220 --> 01:49:38,359
What if I need to use the bathroom?

1203
01:49:38,359 --> 01:49:40,119
So I just pee on the bushes?

1204
01:49:40,119 --> 01:49:42,680
All right, let's get this out

1205
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:44,680
All right. I'm gonna do this very efficiently

1206
01:49:45,079 --> 01:49:47,770
Because I gotta mow the whole lawn

1207
01:49:48,539 --> 01:49:50,390
What am I gonna get for this?

1208
01:49:50,390 --> 01:49:51,109
like

1209
01:49:51,109 --> 01:49:55,909
20 bucks because that's okay when I used to door to door be a lawnmower salesman

1210
01:49:56,390 --> 01:50:00,710
I would mow lawns when I was younger and you got 20 dollars to do the person's entire yard

1211
01:50:01,350 --> 01:50:03,350
How was it worth it? Let's see

1212
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:20,380
Okay. So this is what I was paid for

1213
01:50:22,060 --> 01:50:32,359
Was I getting the advantage taken of me yeah, there you go son. There's a 20 dollar bill

1214
01:50:34,970 --> 01:50:39,689
Thanks for the back breaking fucking four and a half hours of work

1215
01:50:40,979 --> 01:50:43,300
That's 20 dollars. So you can take that to the arcade

1216
01:50:44,119 --> 01:50:48,920
Yeah, I can take it to the arcade. Yeah, you can take it to the thank you by the arcade buddy. Mr

1217
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:52,789
stewarts

1218
01:50:52,789 --> 01:50:56,310
Is the name that i'm being given on the stream for ten person?

1219
01:50:57,109 --> 01:50:58,149
Joe

1220
01:50:58,149 --> 01:51:17,239
This is not doing it. I know why are you mowing along with a weed whacker because I can't I don't have a lawnmower

1221
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:25,640
This thing sucks

1222
01:51:26,279 --> 01:51:30,840
You're using a corner edger to mow an entire one

1223
01:51:32,890 --> 01:51:37,770
Imagine looking out the window and seeing this sorry ass guy out here just mowing with an edger

1224
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:49,420
I don't have access to a lawnmower

1225
01:51:53,029 --> 01:52:08,760
Coming soon. I don't think there is a lawnmower. It's not in the game yet

1226
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:24,119
Oh god and flipper. Am I going to e3 this year? I I don't know

1227
01:52:26,949 --> 01:52:29,029
Didn't everybody back out of e3?

1228
01:52:29,750 --> 01:52:34,579
Like everybody backed out of that one dude's birthday party

1229
01:52:35,060 --> 01:52:41,060
You passed out invitations to everybody and like one of the cool kids isn't going

1230
01:52:41,619 --> 01:52:45,619
So then all of a sudden you get like ah, I mean, I can't go. I'm sick

1231
01:52:47,850 --> 01:52:51,289
And then you end up with just like the your two or three close friends that go

1232
01:52:59,770 --> 01:53:03,289
And you rented out the whole laser tag arena. It was gonna be really cool

1233
01:53:05,750 --> 01:53:07,750
You have this vision in your mind

1234
01:53:08,489 --> 01:53:11,449
Of two teams of like 15 people on each team

1235
01:53:19,529 --> 01:53:21,529
Not the laser tag again

1236
01:53:25,829 --> 01:53:27,989
That just kind of reminds me. Does anybody else do this?

1237
01:53:29,109 --> 01:53:29,989
where

1238
01:53:29,989 --> 01:53:33,829
So you've like a trip or something that you've like wanted to do or planned for a long time

1239
01:53:33,909 --> 01:53:35,510
You have all these like ideas of how it's gonna go

1240
01:53:35,510 --> 01:53:37,989
Like it would like a water park or like disney world or something

1241
01:53:39,289 --> 01:53:44,329
And you go you have you think about like weeks in advance like all this shit that you're gonna do

1242
01:53:44,569 --> 01:53:50,090
And how much fucking fun it's going to be and how amazing you're gonna try that and you're gonna try that that

1243
01:53:50,090 --> 01:53:55,770
This restaurant seems cool. We'll try that one and then you get there and you do like two things and you're like, this is this stupid

1244
01:53:56,409 --> 01:54:02,920
this sucks

1245
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:04,760
Or like, uh, this is

1246
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:06,760
It's like okay, I guess

1247
01:54:07,159 --> 01:54:11,479
And you've spent weeks before man. I go like we're gonna try this is gonna be so awesome

1248
01:54:11,560 --> 01:54:13,560
And you have the thing you're like, oh this is

1249
01:54:14,489 --> 01:54:23,420
Yeah, that's all right

1250
01:54:23,420 --> 01:54:26,939
The most fun just kind of happens when you just don't even you accidentally have it

1251
01:54:28,550 --> 01:54:30,789
it's like you go to the disney world and

1252
01:54:31,670 --> 01:54:35,510
Instead of the ride that you wanted to ride and getting off it and being like that was fun

1253
01:54:36,069 --> 01:54:40,710
No, no, there's like a clown in the street. That's like juggling and you love it and you're like, this is fucking great

1254
01:54:41,029 --> 01:54:43,029
That's the best thing i've ever seen in my entire life

1255
01:54:43,750 --> 01:55:01,319
It's those moments. That's why I don't have a schedule and I and I don't stream that much

1256
01:55:06,010 --> 01:55:08,250
He's gonna tie it back into streams

1257
01:55:11,130 --> 01:55:12,010
You know

1258
01:55:12,010 --> 01:55:25,960
That makes sense doesn't it? It just makes sense to me. This amusement park sucks

1259
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:33,399
You know when you get a game

1260
01:55:33,399 --> 01:55:38,100
And you're really excited for the dlc because it's like gardening and wow i'm so excited for this

1261
01:55:38,100 --> 01:55:40,100
I'm writing down all these things I want to do

1262
01:55:40,340 --> 01:55:45,859
And how much fun it's gonna be to plant and garden wow planting cherry trees and then you start mowing a lawn

1263
01:55:48,420 --> 01:55:49,300
and

1264
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:53,720
kind of realize

1265
01:56:04,060 --> 01:56:08,060
Stop sputter walking. What are you what is sputter walking?

1266
01:56:10,810 --> 01:56:13,609
I feel like is that is that sputter walking like

1267
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:19,260
Because I have to because look it doesn't look look look look look look look look look look watch ready

1268
01:56:20,470 --> 01:56:22,630
It doesn't get it all you see look behind me

1269
01:56:23,350 --> 01:56:25,670
There's like I I have to sputter walk

1270
01:56:27,020 --> 01:56:29,560
Because it doesn't get it all

1271
01:56:29,560 --> 01:56:31,560
Stop sputter walking

1272
01:56:31,720 --> 01:56:32,680
Ah

1273
01:56:32,680 --> 01:56:34,119
See look

1274
01:56:34,119 --> 01:56:36,619
See look at

1275
01:56:36,619 --> 01:56:38,619
Look, I have to do it again second pass

1276
01:56:39,100 --> 01:56:41,350
I wanted to get it all in one pass. What do you mean? He doesn't know

1277
01:56:41,909 --> 01:56:43,909
No, it doesn't look. Are you looking?

1278
01:56:44,550 --> 01:56:47,140
Look look. Are you looking?

1279
01:56:47,140 --> 01:56:49,899
Look at it. It just did it

1280
01:56:52,010 --> 01:56:54,310
Look, are you looking?

1281
01:56:54,310 --> 01:57:03,770
See

1282
01:57:03,770 --> 01:57:06,699
Look, it's not done

1283
01:57:06,699 --> 01:57:09,979
right here

1284
01:57:09,979 --> 01:57:11,260
See look at that

1285
01:57:11,260 --> 01:57:13,340
Fuck you i'm wrong. Am I wrong?

1286
01:57:14,939 --> 01:57:16,939
Because it looks like it's not cutting them all down

1287
01:57:21,609 --> 01:57:25,079
Fuck i'm wrong

1288
01:57:25,079 --> 01:57:27,079
I thought I was not cutting all them down

1289
01:57:28,569 --> 01:57:33,930
God damn it. I hate being wrong. I know i'm not wrong. I'm not wrong. Fuck. I hate I can't be wrong

1290
01:57:34,250 --> 01:57:37,579
No, I can't be wrong about anything

1291
01:57:37,659 --> 01:57:40,859
Uh, no, it's actually um, uh, somehow you're wrong

1292
01:57:41,420 --> 01:57:43,739
And i'm gonna explain with insane

1293
01:57:44,460 --> 01:57:46,939
Jumping through hoops to figure out a way that you're wrong and i'm right

1294
01:57:47,500 --> 01:57:49,899
Because I can't be wrong. That's not possible. No way

1295
01:57:51,020 --> 01:57:53,020
That's never i've never been wrong in my life

1296
01:57:53,500 --> 01:58:01,770
I mean that's maybe one time. Well, I like

1297
01:58:02,569 --> 01:58:04,010
I paid for something

1298
01:58:04,010 --> 01:58:06,649
And it was like a dollar 80 and I gave the guy

1299
01:58:07,289 --> 01:58:26,500
Like 220 and like I fucked off. I mean that's like everybody does that though. I was right. I was right

1300
01:58:27,060 --> 01:58:40,520
I'm right. I'm right. Look at how right I am. Do you see?

1301
01:58:42,970 --> 01:58:44,170
Watch this ready

1302
01:58:44,170 --> 01:58:53,859
Look at how right I was told you guys i've only been i've only been one one once in my life five

1303
01:58:55,939 --> 01:59:00,869
I didn't miss

1304
01:59:00,869 --> 01:59:05,800
What if you can't miss?

1305
01:59:05,859 --> 01:59:07,479
sputter streamer

1306
01:59:07,479 --> 01:59:10,279
No, i'm not. Look at how clean this looks this only took

1307
01:59:11,859 --> 01:59:18,899
375 dollars worth of money. Look at the minimap you missed we'll determine that at a later date

1308
01:59:23,979 --> 01:59:25,979
God i'm so glad that I won that argument

1309
01:59:26,539 --> 01:59:27,420
Oh

1310
01:59:27,420 --> 01:59:38,229
Feels great

1311
01:59:38,229 --> 01:59:39,909
hydrate idiot

1312
01:59:39,909 --> 01:59:45,510
See now we're just having a normal discussion and you have to bring this mean behavior in like, oh, come on

1313
01:59:45,590 --> 01:59:48,229
See what i'm talking about like this. I had them right too

1314
01:59:48,869 --> 01:59:49,829
uh

1315
01:59:49,829 --> 02:00:04,680
Come on

1316
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:13,659
I'll take a break here in a minute. Just just relax. We're fine. It's like arguing with your mom

1317
02:00:14,220 --> 02:00:17,609
There's so many of these I just

1318
02:00:18,710 --> 02:00:20,710
Can we just use fire instead?

1319
02:00:25,989 --> 02:00:31,739
Can I like I think I might have been wrong

1320
02:00:33,140 --> 02:00:35,140
Maybe it's possible but you know

1321
02:00:35,539 --> 02:00:39,670
I think so though

1322
02:00:39,670 --> 02:00:46,119
I mean I was the lead in my school play. How would I ever be fucking wrong about anything?

1323
02:00:52,170 --> 02:00:54,170
But one time I threw

1324
02:00:54,250 --> 02:00:55,609
a pass

1325
02:00:55,609 --> 02:00:58,010
A 40 yard pass

1326
02:00:58,010 --> 02:01:00,010
How the fuck could I ever be wrong?

1327
02:01:03,989 --> 02:01:05,989
I did I mean I did that once

1328
02:01:06,149 --> 02:01:26,710
I got it all I did it wait. I didn't get this part. There's one little strip here

1329
02:01:27,590 --> 02:01:34,060
All right. That's good

1330
02:01:34,060 --> 02:01:36,060
That's good. Look at that

1331
02:01:36,840 --> 02:02:31,899
420 bucks, let's give me a second. Okay

1332
02:02:56,710 --> 02:03:04,579
Ah, okay, this is like this

1333
02:03:23,609 --> 02:03:48,949
I'm running out of space. No, not always riot always right always

1334
02:03:52,489 --> 02:03:54,489
Always right

1335
02:03:58,619 --> 02:04:01,420
Oh imagine coming here to this house. Yeah, this is

1336
02:04:03,720 --> 02:04:05,260
always

1337
02:04:05,260 --> 02:04:07,289
Right

1338
02:04:07,289 --> 02:04:10,250
You spent that much time writing that but you didn't mow your whole lawn

1339
02:04:15,100 --> 02:04:18,539
I feel like this is the kind of person that would have like 40 bumper stickers

1340
02:04:28,489 --> 02:04:33,180
right

1341
02:04:33,180 --> 02:04:35,180
So, okay. I was partially wrong

1342
02:04:36,779 --> 02:04:39,210
You want to know why?

1343
02:04:39,210 --> 02:04:44,489
Here's why you were partially wrong because if i'm putting that's how i'm gonna spin it check this out ready

1344
02:04:44,890 --> 02:04:46,890
If i'm putting straight down

1345
02:04:46,890 --> 02:04:52,250
Like this. Yes, it gets it all but if I have it up a little it's not cutting and I didn't know that

1346
02:04:52,649 --> 02:04:54,890
I I thought it had it didn't matter what the angle was

1347
02:04:55,449 --> 02:04:57,850
So you were partially wrong and I was always right

1348
02:05:10,149 --> 02:05:13,350
All right. I think it's time to buy a house. I think I know I know what I know what to do

1349
02:05:14,409 --> 02:05:16,409
Browser. I got to look at all the money I have

1350
02:05:19,060 --> 02:05:21,460
Let's do a little fixer upper

1351
02:05:22,100 --> 02:05:23,380
for purchase

1352
02:05:23,380 --> 02:05:25,699
Look at this one

1353
02:05:25,699 --> 02:05:31,979
Seventy four thousand dollars dude. I

1354
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:35,640
I pissed away 74 grand in my sleep

1355
02:05:53,590 --> 02:05:54,869
Let's try it

1356
02:05:54,869 --> 02:05:56,869
We can let's look at this. This is a nice little fixer upper

1357
02:05:57,430 --> 02:06:04,739
Home alone house now, we can't go right to a thousand miles per hour. I mean don't buy

1358
02:06:05,380 --> 02:06:12,229
No, i'm buying this

1359
02:06:12,229 --> 02:06:14,470
No, i'm not going to a million miles per hour

1360
02:06:16,229 --> 02:06:21,510
Take a part in the garden contest to increase the house value. You may take part in the garden contest

1361
02:06:22,069 --> 02:06:24,869
Press enter and select type you want to rate your garden

1362
02:06:26,489 --> 02:06:30,329
I don't know what any of these mean

1363
02:06:30,329 --> 02:06:32,329
Submit garden for contest

1364
02:06:34,140 --> 02:06:38,739
What? American garden crop english

1365
02:06:39,460 --> 02:06:41,699
Modern garden. All right, i'm gonna go for the modern garden

1366
02:06:42,420 --> 02:06:46,500
It's very often treated as another room with com yeah, but i'm gonna make like a little barbecue or something

1367
02:06:51,289 --> 02:06:53,289
Oh, that's it's right now

1368
02:06:59,100 --> 02:07:02,779
Okay plant selection five stars equipment five stars lay out three

1369
02:07:03,890 --> 02:07:06,869
uncleaned garden one percent home increased by

1370
02:07:10,340 --> 02:07:13,539
Hey, let's put this up for a garden contest

1371
02:07:14,340 --> 02:07:20,979
You see what I really did with the cans

1372
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:24,279
I was really going

1373
02:07:24,279 --> 02:07:27,510
Oh my god

1374
02:07:27,510 --> 02:07:31,109
All right. Let's get started. Let's get started. I'm fucking happy. Let's go

1375
02:07:33,449 --> 02:07:42,539
There's nothing what do you mean? Nothing to dig

1376
02:07:42,619 --> 02:07:44,619
Oh shit, you have to get every little piece

1377
02:07:50,729 --> 02:07:52,729
Take a mental note of what this looks like

1378
02:07:52,810 --> 02:07:54,260
Because it'll be probably

1379
02:07:54,260 --> 02:07:55,380
um

1380
02:07:55,380 --> 02:07:59,300
I'm trying to think this is how it'll be like at least

1381
02:08:00,159 --> 02:08:02,260
32 to 35 percent better

1382
02:08:02,899 --> 02:08:06,180
When i'm done take a mental note of what you see right here. I put away the tool

1383
02:08:08,229 --> 02:08:10,229
Screenshot that and then that

1384
02:08:11,220 --> 02:08:13,220
And this and then screenshot this

1385
02:08:13,859 --> 02:08:17,939
Get a screenshot of this too because I want you to compile. This is like a big collage screenshot that

1386
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:20,500
Get a close-up of that one screenshot right now

1387
02:08:20,739 --> 02:08:23,050
Get a screen grab of that

1388
02:08:23,050 --> 02:08:26,329
Screenshot of like right here screen. Grab that one there

1389
02:08:27,369 --> 02:08:31,529
Keep up with me this right here and facing this way long ways. Hope you got them all

1390
02:08:35,529 --> 02:08:38,630
Is this poop like elephant poop?

1391
02:09:07,079 --> 02:09:11,479
That scared me so much I didn't know that there were fucking animals that came out of it

1392
02:09:17,850 --> 02:09:20,649
He was coming to fight me. Did you see he was like trying to bite me in the legs?

1393
02:09:26,090 --> 02:09:27,800
I yeah

1394
02:09:27,800 --> 02:09:29,319
What a wuss

1395
02:09:29,319 --> 02:09:31,319
Trying to prove that i'm not a wuss

1396
02:09:39,289 --> 02:09:42,460
These cans

1397
02:09:42,460 --> 02:09:45,340
I I okay. Look, I can't I can't imagine

1398
02:09:46,439 --> 02:09:49,479
If you this is like your bedroom right here, right or like right here

1399
02:09:50,359 --> 02:09:54,279
Can you imagine just throwing cans of soda out your open window?

1400
02:09:57,479 --> 02:10:00,520
What are you doing?

1401
02:10:00,520 --> 02:10:04,920
The just don't you have a trash can just you open the windows open and you're just like

1402
02:10:06,199 --> 02:10:20,539
Throw it out the window

1403
02:10:20,619 --> 02:10:22,619
If I ever threw a can on the ground

1404
02:10:23,939 --> 02:10:25,939
It would cause me physical pain

1405
02:10:28,569 --> 02:10:30,409
Not only be not only

1406
02:10:30,409 --> 02:10:31,609
because

1407
02:10:31,609 --> 02:10:34,489
Of the ability to scrape the dna off of the mouth part

1408
02:10:35,449 --> 02:10:37,449
I'm not you know, fuck that

1409
02:10:37,850 --> 02:10:40,970
Not only being able to cotton swab the top of that and fucking get me

1410
02:10:47,189 --> 02:10:51,579
But that it's it's rude and bad and you think i'm making that up. Oh look at question marks

1411
02:10:51,659 --> 02:10:54,779
What the fuck is this weirdo streamer talking about? There was somebody

1412
02:10:55,420 --> 02:10:56,300
That

1413
02:10:56,300 --> 02:11:00,220
Found like gum all over the ground and shit and picked up random stuff

1414
02:11:01,020 --> 02:11:08,890
And did dna testing on it and made people out of it. They like went and got gum

1415
02:11:09,609 --> 02:11:13,850
And like tested it and made what they think the person looked like

1416
02:11:14,649 --> 02:11:18,710
I swear to god, this is real

1417
02:11:18,710 --> 02:11:21,989
They did like a police sketch of these of what the people looked like

1418
02:11:24,970 --> 02:11:34,250
That is true. Yes, it is

1419
02:11:34,250 --> 02:11:37,770
No, i'm not having an episode. This is what do you mean? What about having an episode?

1420
02:11:39,640 --> 02:11:40,680
No, no, no

1421
02:11:40,680 --> 02:11:44,119
You know, i'm not saying like they made a human out of like finding gum in the trash

1422
02:11:44,119 --> 02:11:47,800
i'm saying that somebody did like a scientific research thing where they took

1423
02:11:48,520 --> 02:11:50,520
samples from like stuff in the trash

1424
02:11:51,239 --> 02:11:52,520
and gum

1425
02:11:52,520 --> 02:11:59,800
That was chewed up underneath like seats and shit and they did a dna like genetic code of what that person may look like

1426
02:12:02,489 --> 02:12:04,489
What if you're on there? What if that's you?

1427
02:12:10,069 --> 02:12:13,609
That's so interesting

1428
02:12:13,609 --> 02:12:18,279
That cloning experience. I remember reading about that like years ago

1429
02:12:21,430 --> 02:12:26,069
I didn't say what clone? No, I didn't say cloning. I said that there's like that like that's research

1430
02:12:33,579 --> 02:12:37,340
We already know what you look like. No, you don't you didn't go like find gum

1431
02:12:46,460 --> 02:12:51,659
That's an episode of black mirrors. No, no, this is like actual scientific research

1432
02:12:52,539 --> 02:13:00,170
Hold on stay right there

1433
02:13:00,170 --> 02:13:18,899
Nobody move. Yeah, it's for real

1434
02:13:25,369 --> 02:13:39,800
Just this shit is science guys. It's the pre-recorded joke

1435
02:13:42,279 --> 02:13:43,720
Sight your source

1436
02:13:43,720 --> 02:13:47,640
I think the american institute of uh collegiate scientific discovery

1437
02:13:49,189 --> 02:13:53,430
Yes, I know that sounds like a shell company for like a bit of money like launder money

1438
02:14:05,590 --> 02:14:07,590
mla format

1439
02:14:11,909 --> 02:14:15,750
The article and or researcher. All right, do I hold let me see if I can find this

1440
02:14:16,310 --> 02:14:18,310
I remember this was so fascinating

1441
02:14:39,180 --> 02:14:40,619
I got it

1442
02:14:40,619 --> 02:14:44,479
Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. It's from the smithsonian

1443
02:14:45,359 --> 02:14:48,960
Are you gonna are you gonna not say that the smithsonian does like something interesting?

1444
02:14:56,600 --> 02:14:59,869
Yeah, like from cigarette butts

1445
02:15:01,159 --> 02:15:10,960
And they can make map out of face. This is me smithsonian smithsonian mag

1446
02:15:11,600 --> 02:15:14,420
Azine so this is this from the smithsonian.com

1447
02:15:18,039 --> 02:15:24,109
All you have to do. I'm not gonna like break the smithsonian website

1448
02:15:24,750 --> 02:15:30,270
If you want to figure out for yourself, you just have to type in pulling dna from gum what they look like

1449
02:15:30,750 --> 02:15:32,750
Into google and you'll find it

1450
02:15:32,829 --> 02:15:33,949
Thanks

1451
02:15:33,949 --> 02:15:41,640
Always wrong though, right? What does it say in my front line?

1452
02:15:42,779 --> 02:15:45,449
What does it say in my front line?

1453
02:15:45,449 --> 02:15:47,050
This is actual research

1454
02:15:47,050 --> 02:16:00,109
It's the god damn smithsonian

1455
02:16:08,359 --> 02:16:10,439
Use it as a retort for everything

1456
02:16:12,189 --> 02:16:25,239
Always right. How do we even get to like the smithsonian like research?

1457
02:16:28,810 --> 02:16:32,010
I work for the smithsonian. Thanks for giving us the shout out. Yeah, it's fucking great

1458
02:16:33,030 --> 02:16:34,170
Absolutely

1459
02:16:34,170 --> 02:16:37,370
Really interesting really cool research for real like it's really cool shit

1460
02:16:38,329 --> 02:16:47,069
Wait, didn't I start by saying that I was terrified of that? No, i'm not that was it's cool shit. What?

1461
02:16:47,790 --> 02:17:00,030
But imagine if you like saw your face

1462
02:17:04,989 --> 02:17:26,680
I do actually think it's pretty cool though for real. Well bullshit. I'd rather not see my face

1463
02:17:27,479 --> 02:17:33,309
Well, of course, of course we shout out science on this channel. It's very interesting stuff

1464
02:17:41,239 --> 02:17:43,239
I don't leave hair. Yes, you do

1465
02:17:44,040 --> 02:17:50,409
What are you talking about? You know, you you know, you shed like 150 hairs a day. What do you mean?

1466
02:17:53,870 --> 02:17:55,870
If you have a head of hair

1467
02:17:55,950 --> 02:17:58,319
You shed 150 hairs a day

1468
02:17:58,559 --> 02:18:04,569
Your hair is everywhere

1469
02:18:04,569 --> 02:18:06,569
Um i'm sputter walking again

1470
02:18:06,889 --> 02:18:12,079
There's a space x launch tonight. That's nice

1471
02:18:18,379 --> 02:18:21,739
All right. I'm i'm kind of just like talking I need to like focus

1472
02:18:24,079 --> 02:18:26,079
That's a free haircut every single day. That's true

1473
02:18:26,879 --> 02:18:44,600
How do they know it's my hair nerd?

1474
02:18:45,709 --> 02:18:50,989
Well, if science ever gets to a point where they can genetically take your entire code from that hair

1475
02:18:51,950 --> 02:18:53,469
They'll be able to know

1476
02:18:53,549 --> 02:18:57,790
That yeah, you ordered four big macs last night. You were in line

1477
02:18:58,510 --> 02:19:01,229
At that mcdonald's and you got four big macs

1478
02:19:01,790 --> 02:19:10,780
You can't hide that anymore

1479
02:19:10,780 --> 02:19:14,299
They'll have like some big mac juice saliva and you

1480
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:16,239
Like that

1481
02:19:16,239 --> 02:19:18,239
dripped out onto the ground

1482
02:19:18,620 --> 02:19:22,540
And they'll be able to tell the quantity of big macs that you ate because of the like enzymes in your saliva

1483
02:19:23,260 --> 02:19:25,260
Give it like another 500 years

1484
02:19:29,319 --> 02:19:36,459
Did they get me?

1485
02:19:36,459 --> 02:19:38,620
Did they get me?

1486
02:19:38,620 --> 02:19:56,409
Uh-oh, we were all right for a little while. I think we're good quantity of big macs

1487
02:19:56,409 --> 02:19:58,409
How many big macs do you eat? Well, it depends

1488
02:19:59,340 --> 02:20:02,540
It I mean it depends on how hungry I am. What's the scenario my

1489
02:20:04,409 --> 02:20:06,409
as I haven't been like

1490
02:20:06,409 --> 02:20:11,639
Streaming or whatever. Oh, no, my stream is sputter walking

1491
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:15,520
Yeah, it was kind of inevitable because they didn't do anything

1492
02:20:16,700 --> 02:20:21,180
And i'm I was told that maybe as of we'd have a static ip later today

1493
02:20:21,659 --> 02:20:23,659
Oh, I think it's actually to zero

1494
02:20:24,059 --> 02:20:36,059
Holy shit, that was bad

1495
02:20:36,059 --> 02:20:37,739
Hold on. Let me send a text

1496
02:20:37,739 --> 02:20:46,040
Am I good?

1497
02:20:46,040 --> 02:20:48,760
I'm supposed to i'm supposed to text somebody when it's like really bad

1498
02:20:59,690 --> 02:21:01,370
Hold on. Give me a second

1499
02:21:01,370 --> 02:21:06,299
Give me one second

1500
02:21:06,299 --> 02:21:16,680
I would call this bad. I would call this

1501
02:21:18,319 --> 02:21:21,360
Not good

1502
02:21:21,360 --> 02:21:26,559
Hmm, is it worth I I feel like I got my hand on like the emergency line and I feel like I

1503
02:21:26,799 --> 02:21:28,799
I don't want to pick it up and be like help me, please

1504
02:21:29,280 --> 02:21:31,280
And they're like there's nothing there. Oh

1505
02:21:31,680 --> 02:21:33,280
Yeah, I don't want to be like the

1506
02:21:33,280 --> 02:21:38,989
The boy who crawled uh cried frames do we got a raid?

1507
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:48,809
Oh shit, we do have a raid. Hello everybody. Hopefully we stay connected to the internet

1508
02:21:51,879 --> 02:21:53,799

1522
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:43,790

02:23:43,790 --> 02:23:50,000
Wow, congratulations. That's insane

1524
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:53,920
All right, I think it's time to say I gotta say I got I gotta like pick up the emergency phone line here

1525
02:23:58,639 --> 02:24:00,639
I'm going for the emergency phone line

1526
02:24:00,639 --> 02:24:19,920
Wish me luck. Let's see. Hold on

1527
02:24:20,799 --> 02:24:31,610
I didn't know how long this stream was gonna be and I hope we can actually keep it going for like at least a little

1528
02:24:31,610 --> 02:24:33,290
while longer

1529
02:24:33,290 --> 02:24:39,950
All right. I got my I got my hand on the button. I have a text written out and i'm ready to like press the button

1530
02:24:46,559 --> 02:24:57,420
I sent it. I sent it. I pressed it. It's been done

1531
02:25:06,360 --> 02:25:08,520
Let's see. Let's see if anything happens

1532
02:25:19,420 --> 02:25:21,420
I just got a text message

1533
02:25:22,440 --> 02:25:24,520
Well, hey, come on, give me a hand here

1534
02:25:30,409 --> 02:25:35,049
No, i'll be right back. I'm calling. I got i'm going for it. I'm gonna i'm no text is not fast enough

1535
02:25:35,049 --> 02:25:36,250
I gotta do it now

1536
02:25:36,250 --> 02:25:39,610
I'll be right back. I'm calling i'll be right back

1537
02:27:13,370 --> 02:27:17,290
Uh, that would happen wouldn't it? Oh god damn it

1538
02:27:20,250 --> 02:27:21,930
No

1539
02:27:21,930 --> 02:27:24,409
Uh, so I i've tried to call

1540
02:27:27,100 --> 02:27:29,819
Let me try to catch it call me when something happens

1541
02:27:31,420 --> 02:27:36,280
The phone is off

1542
02:27:36,280 --> 02:27:38,280
It goes right to voice bill

1543
02:27:38,520 --> 02:27:42,360
And they didn't get the text either because it doesn't say delivered their phone is off

1544
02:27:44,590 --> 02:27:49,629
No, it's not they're not closed. This is a direct line to somebody. This is this is somebody's like phone number

1545
02:27:57,760 --> 02:27:59,760
No, this is the opportunity

1546
02:28:00,719 --> 02:28:01,920
No

1547
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:03,920
Charge your phone. What?

1548
02:28:12,030 --> 02:28:15,469
They called you no no, but that no no that wasn't them

1549
02:28:17,149 --> 02:28:19,479
No, they didn't that wasn't them

1550
02:28:19,479 --> 02:28:21,959
I i recognize that that was a different number

1551
02:28:22,760 --> 02:28:27,079
I have this person in my phone as like the cox guy and that's not who it was

1552
02:28:29,770 --> 02:28:35,280
Oh, well, it's okay

1553
02:28:35,280 --> 02:28:36,959
Uh, let's do

1554
02:28:36,959 --> 02:28:40,670
Let's do this

1555
02:28:40,670 --> 02:28:43,500
And faster digging

1556
02:28:43,500 --> 02:28:47,500
But after all I just wanted to make sure I clearly state uh everyone that came over from

1557
02:28:48,059 --> 02:28:50,059
Uh robaz's channel

1558
02:28:51,870 --> 02:28:54,110
Uh, I kind of was in the middle of this bullshit. So

1559
02:28:55,879 --> 02:28:58,200
Thank you again for coming out and again. Thanks for the raid

1560
02:28:59,959 --> 02:29:01,479
I really appreciate it

1561
02:29:01,479 --> 02:29:07,479
Just want to make sure I got that out

1562
02:29:07,479 --> 02:29:11,000
Because I didn't know if we were dropping or not in the middle of me talking about it

1563
02:29:11,719 --> 02:29:16,809
I'm saying i've got i've got an accent. I can't help it

1564
02:29:24,860 --> 02:29:26,860
I don't think this is any of the stream

1565
02:29:28,879 --> 02:29:30,879
No, we're good. It's all right. We'll be fine

1566
02:29:32,889 --> 02:29:34,889
Just everyone uh

1567
02:29:35,559 --> 02:29:41,799
Everybody just at the same time close your eyes and just think about how just think good thoughts here

1568
02:29:58,459 --> 02:30:03,420
The good thoughts aren't working here, but if we all use our like brain power

1569
02:30:03,739 --> 02:30:15,370
We can use our own 5g 6g network to be able to fix this. Does everybody think like give

1570
02:30:16,010 --> 02:30:20,569
Me better internet right now and like now our brains have electromagnetic, uh currents to them

1571
02:30:21,290 --> 02:30:28,350
We're gonna make our own like 7g network into this house

1572
02:30:29,149 --> 02:30:35,229
There's so much dead grass

1573
02:30:35,790 --> 02:30:49,680
I think it worked

1574
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:55,280
Okay now like like a thousand of you just dedicate yourselves to to doing the brain power thing

1575
02:30:55,840 --> 02:31:03,690
And we should be fine. I need to get these weeds

1576
02:31:06,909 --> 02:31:07,870
No

1577
02:31:07,870 --> 02:31:16,510
Uh, you don't have to do that. I'm kidding. I think it passed

1578
02:31:19,629 --> 02:31:21,629
Yeah, I think we're fine

1579
02:31:23,770 --> 02:31:26,360
You guys did it

1580
02:31:26,360 --> 02:31:29,319
You guys you guys did it you actually did it

1581
02:31:29,959 --> 02:31:47,850
I'm, so proud of you guys

1582
02:31:47,850 --> 02:31:54,940
Maybe maybe he got the text hopefully I didn't I hope he wasn't eating like a pizza or something

1583
02:31:55,659 --> 02:31:58,090
Because if you're eating pizza that your hands

1584
02:31:58,409 --> 02:32:02,569
You can't really do anything. You're like a greasy hands and you can't really help and he's probably eating a pizza

1585
02:32:02,569 --> 02:32:13,319
And I didn't want to like bother him

1586
02:32:13,319 --> 02:32:15,959
If you had like a deep dish pizza, would you want someone to like text you?

1587
02:32:16,840 --> 02:32:19,770
No, you put your phone on silent until you're done

1588
02:32:20,940 --> 02:32:25,659
And you're gonna eat the whole fucking thing. That's fine. Don't tell that and then people are gonna be like

1589
02:32:25,819 --> 02:32:27,819
You ate a whole pizza. Don't worry. Don't listen to them

1590
02:32:28,379 --> 02:32:39,899
That's okay

1591
02:32:39,899 --> 02:32:48,620
It's not healthy. I know look at all this grass

1592
02:32:49,979 --> 02:32:52,059
I'm gonna shape this place up though. Just you wait

1593
02:32:52,700 --> 02:33:00,639
I want that lawnmower though

1594
02:33:00,719 --> 02:33:07,659
Can I not get the lawnmower?

1595
02:33:07,659 --> 02:33:09,659
I wish jerma would text me

1596
02:33:09,819 --> 02:33:12,000
No, you don't want me to text you

1597
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:15,000
It'd be a bunch of nonsense

1598
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:21,280
All right this house

1599
02:33:21,280 --> 02:33:23,840
Do the weeds grow back after a certain amount of time?

1600
02:33:29,159 --> 02:33:41,559
I feel like they probably do

1601
02:33:41,559 --> 02:33:43,639
Come on get in there right in the middle. I'll get it later

1602
02:33:44,780 --> 02:33:46,139
All right

1603
02:33:46,139 --> 02:33:48,569
So far so good

1604
02:33:48,569 --> 02:33:52,280
Looking pretty damn good

1605
02:33:52,360 --> 02:33:54,040
Oh

1606
02:33:54,040 --> 02:34:00,510
A little bit on the edge here. I'll get it. I can't get it

1607
02:34:01,469 --> 02:34:02,909
No, I cannot get that

1608
02:34:02,909 --> 02:34:09,709
Yes, I can

1609
02:34:09,709 --> 02:34:12,350
Gotta get the roots or the weeds will never go away

1610
02:34:14,090 --> 02:34:16,409
I don't think this game is going that deep

1611
02:34:17,129 --> 02:34:20,329
The house is a piece of crap though

1612
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:28,159
So many weeds and so much grass

1613
02:34:36,639 --> 02:34:38,719
With the yeah, you know the house has to be renovated too

1614
02:34:43,469 --> 02:34:46,430
All right. What if I just do the part again if I just do the part that people see

1615
02:34:47,149 --> 02:34:49,639
Who cares, right?

1616
02:34:49,639 --> 02:34:52,440
No one's gonna look in this bush and see there's grass in there

1617
02:34:54,110 --> 02:34:58,989
Who's gonna do that?

1618
02:34:58,989 --> 02:35:00,989
That's being lazy. Yeah, but

1619
02:35:02,280 --> 02:35:03,879
You don't have to do it all

1620
02:35:03,879 --> 02:35:11,239
Come on get it almost done

1621
02:35:13,360 --> 02:35:20,059
He's being a lazy boy all this crap. That's what it is. It's crap

1622
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:28,159
Look at all this crap

1623
02:35:28,159 --> 02:35:29,280
um

1624
02:35:29,280 --> 02:35:31,280
Get this chunk out of here

1625
02:35:31,440 --> 02:35:34,379
Replace it with some cactuses

1626
02:35:34,379 --> 02:35:42,590
I want some light

1627
02:35:42,590 --> 02:35:44,670
You're gonna make a house with a dad in the bushes

1628
02:35:45,629 --> 02:35:54,090
I have to play the brain. I'm not gonna play the brain power song

1629
02:35:55,690 --> 02:35:58,329
No

1630
02:35:58,329 --> 02:36:00,329
No brain power

1631
02:36:02,750 --> 02:36:04,750
I don't want to overdo it because you'll overload it

1632
02:36:05,389 --> 02:36:10,440
Can it be daylight, please?

1633
02:36:10,840 --> 02:36:12,840
So I can get on with this project

1634
02:36:13,159 --> 02:36:24,040
Need more power. I need to zoom in here with my seat. There we go

1635
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:28,799
Let's open the door and see what we got working with in the inside

1636
02:36:29,520 --> 02:36:35,559
I need lights

1637
02:36:35,559 --> 02:36:37,930
ugly

1638
02:36:37,930 --> 02:36:40,489
Revolting what's with the rooms in this house?

1639
02:36:41,129 --> 02:36:50,489
Like give me some light

1640
02:36:50,489 --> 02:36:53,760
Uh, it doesn't matter

1641
02:36:54,319 --> 02:37:04,079
Oh just put i'm gonna replace him, but let's just buy a bunch

1642
02:37:05,120 --> 02:37:10,479
Can I put these outside?

1643
02:37:10,479 --> 02:37:12,479
I need the light out here temporarily

1644
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:26,030
How do I turn these on I need the lights on the outside

1645
02:37:26,829 --> 02:37:33,680
All right. Here we go

1646
02:37:33,680 --> 02:37:35,079
What?

1647
02:37:35,079 --> 02:37:40,479
Why?

1648
02:37:40,479 --> 02:37:58,889
That doesn't control that how is it possible? Well, that's annoying. I forgot I had a flashlight. Thank you for the tip

1649
02:38:05,850 --> 02:38:09,559
No one's gonna see that. All right. What about I gotta clean this house up

1650
02:38:10,750 --> 02:38:13,469
I'm gonna be rolling out the uh, green carpet here

1651
02:38:14,909 --> 02:38:18,030
Make sure I got enough. You don't get this all just get rid of all of it

1652
02:38:19,149 --> 02:38:21,149
Yeah, fuck that get out of here

1653
02:38:22,680 --> 02:38:24,440
Put it in myself

1654
02:38:24,440 --> 02:38:32,540
This looks like left for dead. It kind of does

1655
02:38:33,500 --> 02:38:34,860
You are right

1656
02:38:34,860 --> 02:38:44,459
Give me that last little thing there. Come on

1657
02:38:45,180 --> 02:38:51,100
This game is seriously such you could become such a perfectionist

1658
02:38:57,479 --> 02:38:59,879
How is he still mowing the fucking lawn?

1659
02:39:00,680 --> 02:39:02,760
Because i'm doing it with a weed whacker

1660
02:39:05,500 --> 02:39:17,530
It would take this long

1661
02:39:17,530 --> 02:39:22,270
All right a wild

1662
02:39:23,079 --> 02:39:24,200
animal

1663
02:39:24,200 --> 02:39:30,600
At this edge

1664
02:39:30,600 --> 02:39:32,600
Ah, all right. Nice

1665
02:39:33,719 --> 02:39:35,719
I hope you had those screenshots from before ready

1666
02:39:36,280 --> 02:39:39,639
Because i'm gonna need them

1667
02:39:39,639 --> 02:39:42,079
Well, not yet, but in like probably like an hour

1668
02:39:47,790 --> 02:39:50,110
You mowing the lawn with a weed whacker at 3 a.m

1669
02:39:52,559 --> 02:39:55,440
Yeah, i'm probably on something really strong

1670
02:39:56,000 --> 02:40:11,319
I'm not sure what though

1671
02:40:11,319 --> 02:40:13,319
Watch out for the mole

1672
02:40:13,319 --> 02:40:26,379
I have to work in the morning. Why are you doing this?

1673
02:40:28,780 --> 02:40:31,899
Just just just 20 minutes, man. I got this

1674
02:40:32,620 --> 02:40:39,450
Hey, do you care if I play some music?

1675
02:40:39,450 --> 02:40:43,239
Anybody care if I play music?

1676
02:40:43,239 --> 02:40:57,600
Play some music

1677
02:40:57,600 --> 02:40:59,149
One of these

1678
02:40:59,149 --> 02:41:29,309
We need a clean slate because I want to get all I can put my own stuff in here. There we go

1679
02:41:33,129 --> 02:41:39,549
Oh, by the way, I forgot to say this the uh, the the one of the cocks maintenance like technician people

1680
02:41:40,750 --> 02:41:44,670
They told me that the reason why we're having problems is because of the kids playing call of duty

1681
02:41:46,889 --> 02:41:48,409
I'm not making that up

1682
02:41:48,409 --> 02:41:59,399
I swear to god

1683
02:41:59,399 --> 02:42:01,399
It's those kids playing call of duty

1684
02:42:03,719 --> 02:42:06,399
Oh

1685
02:42:06,399 --> 02:42:09,049
All right

1686
02:42:09,049 --> 02:42:11,049
You're one of those kids

1687
02:42:12,329 --> 02:42:15,370
I'm playing ultra call of duty. I'm playing call of duty

1688
02:42:16,270 --> 02:42:18,270
on like 30 xboxes

1689
02:42:35,799 --> 02:42:44,780
Nobody even plays black ops anymore. It's those damn video games clogging up the toilet

1690
02:42:48,399 --> 02:42:49,840
Hey, okay

1691
02:42:49,840 --> 02:42:51,040
You in there?

1692
02:42:51,040 --> 02:42:52,000
Yeah

1693
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,409
What are you doing there for so long?

1694
02:42:54,409 --> 02:42:56,569
Nothing just I have to go to the bathroom

1695
02:42:57,790 --> 02:42:59,790
Get off a fucking call of duty

1696
02:42:59,790 --> 02:43:00,829
Come on

1697
02:43:00,829 --> 02:43:15,959
We gotta go to church mom said it's my turn to play

1698
02:43:16,360 --> 02:43:21,770
All right, but let's just let's just say that is the case, right? That's like let's say that's the truth

1699
02:43:22,250 --> 02:43:24,010
And that's really what's happening

1700
02:43:24,010 --> 02:43:26,889
What the fuck are you supposed to do?

1701
02:43:28,090 --> 02:43:30,059
What?

1702
02:43:30,059 --> 02:43:32,379
Too many video games too many internet connections too many

1703
02:43:33,739 --> 02:43:45,799
All right

1704
02:43:45,799 --> 02:43:47,799
Cock said it's my turn to use the internet

1705
02:43:55,579 --> 02:43:57,579
Don't queue our spier right now

1706
02:43:59,690 --> 02:44:01,129
All right

1707
02:44:01,129 --> 02:44:03,129
I think we are clean

1708
02:44:18,059 --> 02:44:26,809
Uh time to become like an irl streamer carrying on one of those like ghostbusters internet backpacks

1709
02:44:27,370 --> 02:44:43,309
Where's the broccoli video?

1710
02:44:44,399 --> 02:44:46,399
I got a big bigger fish to fry at this point

1711
02:44:50,190 --> 02:44:55,469
Okay, so we're good. Let's take take care of the uh, although outside is good

1712
02:44:55,629 --> 02:44:57,629
I'm gonna do a line. I don't even know what I want to do

1713
02:44:58,350 --> 02:45:03,709
We're gonna replace this grass. First of all, that's really important

1714
02:45:07,129 --> 02:45:09,770
That sounded like the weed wacker, but I can assure you it wasn't

1715
02:45:10,329 --> 02:45:20,110
My brother used to work at our local isp with nodes specifically

1716
02:45:20,110 --> 02:45:25,069
And he told me a while ago that 99% of the time they overload the nodes in higher resonance real areas

1717
02:45:25,389 --> 02:45:27,389
Most ips just oh, yeah. No, it's ridiculous

1718
02:45:29,020 --> 02:45:31,180
They don't they they don't give a fuck

1719
02:45:32,409 --> 02:45:37,129
See what they they just load as many customers on as many packages as they can

1720
02:45:37,690 --> 02:45:41,209
Until you have like thousands of people on one node

1721
02:45:42,729 --> 02:45:44,809
And then it doesn't work as good anymore

1722
02:45:46,729 --> 02:45:51,530
But here's the real awful part about this, right? I'm gonna give you the real reality. Don't use that

1723
02:45:53,049 --> 02:45:56,090
Um, most people do not use the internet

1724
02:45:56,729 --> 02:45:58,090
like this

1725
02:45:58,090 --> 02:45:59,950
right

1726
02:45:59,950 --> 02:46:02,270
most households do not have

1727
02:46:03,229 --> 02:46:05,870
A connection that needs to be constantly stable

1728
02:46:09,079 --> 02:46:11,639
like six thousand up

1729
02:46:12,440 --> 02:46:15,239
For three four five six seven eight hours, right?

1730
02:46:16,520 --> 02:46:22,360
So they can get away with all this dog shit because for the most part most people don't even know it's happening

1731
02:46:23,799 --> 02:46:31,690
The only reason why we know in this area that this is happening is because like i'm streaming right now. So it

1732
02:46:32,489 --> 02:46:36,649
You you you you're not gonna be like to convince very many people like hey, let me go door to door

1733
02:46:36,649 --> 02:46:38,649
Hey, we're gonna replace that node

1734
02:46:38,729 --> 02:46:42,239
What are you talking about? My internet's fine. I go

1735
02:46:43,420 --> 02:46:44,959
Fuck

1736
02:46:44,959 --> 02:46:46,959
Okay. Well have have a good night

1737
02:46:52,719 --> 02:46:59,180
What the fuck is a node?

1738
02:46:59,180 --> 02:47:00,909
turf

1739
02:47:00,909 --> 02:47:07,290
Big roll. We want a big roll. Let's get this laid out. Yeah, there are other companies out here

1740
02:47:09,049 --> 02:47:14,729
There's like I think like three different isps, but they all are the they run on like the same infrastructure

1741
02:47:15,290 --> 02:47:27,069
Let's get this out here

1742
02:47:27,229 --> 02:47:29,229
Am I do I got that in the right place?

1743
02:47:29,229 --> 02:47:31,930
I hope so

1744
02:47:31,930 --> 02:47:34,430
Build a labo node. Yeah

1745
02:47:35,069 --> 02:47:39,120
but that's why it's it's it's almost like

1746
02:47:40,780 --> 02:47:46,940
It's really difficult to even explain even to a technician. This is somebody who like whose job it is

1747
02:47:47,659 --> 02:47:51,979
To know like the ins and outs of a network and internet, right and they do they do it's not like they don't

1748
02:47:52,860 --> 02:47:54,459
but

1749
02:47:54,459 --> 02:47:56,459
Wait, you you you tube what?

1750
02:47:57,180 --> 02:48:02,940
What are you talking about? What are you doing? I think it looks fine. It's like, yeah

1751
02:48:03,819 --> 02:48:13,180
But I don't think you don't I don't think you understand. Wait, so you're watching youtube videos? No

1752
02:48:14,559 --> 02:48:18,639
No

1753
02:48:18,719 --> 02:48:26,479
What's youtube? No, it's my tubes. Hey that one was perfect

1754
02:48:31,850 --> 02:48:44,909
Shit, this one's not perfect. Cut it up. Get out of here. Just say i'm famous

1755
02:48:48,110 --> 02:48:50,110
What that's not gonna do anything

1756
02:48:52,250 --> 02:48:56,729
Hey, well, so it's it says here that this is this node is uh, kind of overloaded

1757
02:48:57,129 --> 02:49:00,090
And we're really trying to put out maybe oh fuck I did but look

1758
02:49:00,729 --> 02:49:03,049
Whatever

1759
02:49:03,049 --> 02:49:05,129
Yeah, but I i'm i'm famous

1760
02:49:06,680 --> 02:49:10,280
Okay, that's uh, that's fine. We're not replacing that node

1761
02:49:11,930 --> 02:49:18,540
Okay, who you are? I'm just gonna keep this going

1762
02:49:19,180 --> 02:49:24,700
look at this

1763
02:49:24,700 --> 02:49:26,700
and then there's the other option right of

1764
02:49:28,250 --> 02:49:29,850
maybe like you

1765
02:49:29,850 --> 02:49:31,850
Need to rent like an office

1766
02:49:32,489 --> 02:49:34,889
And like go to the office to stream

1767
02:49:35,530 --> 02:49:38,350
But those are expensive

1768
02:49:40,860 --> 02:49:42,860
Those are really expensive

1769
02:49:43,100 --> 02:49:46,680
How much was this?

1770
02:49:46,680 --> 02:49:50,010
Was that just five grand?

1771
02:49:59,399 --> 02:50:06,110
No, it wasn't was it?

1772
02:50:06,110 --> 02:50:08,110
Shit, I did this one wrong too. Sorry

1773
02:50:09,260 --> 02:50:11,260
but I

1774
02:50:11,979 --> 02:50:17,819
Should I really have to go to get like a stable connection? Should I really have to go to like an office complex?

1775
02:50:24,379 --> 02:50:26,219
That shouldn't be a thing

1776
02:50:26,219 --> 02:50:34,639
It's too many customers and not enough nodes to service all of them. Well

1777
02:50:36,270 --> 02:50:38,270
and like I said previously

1778
02:50:38,510 --> 02:50:40,510
Not very many people give a shit

1779
02:50:43,129 --> 02:50:45,930
as long as you know as long as like netflix works and they can like

1780
02:50:46,780 --> 02:50:49,819
You know play their game or whatever and they can check their emails most people just

1781
02:50:50,379 --> 02:51:07,610
Not gonna be that's not a big deal to anybody but sadly it is um

1782
02:51:08,329 --> 02:51:10,329
It is like this kind of everywhere

1783
02:51:10,329 --> 02:51:16,510
I've heard stories from other streamers and other people that have like do this, you know streaming and youtube and stuff

1784
02:51:16,510 --> 02:51:18,510
And they're like, oh, yeah my provider sucks

1785
02:51:18,750 --> 02:51:22,829
Like why do we all say that you know, it seems like that happens very frequently

1786
02:51:25,559 --> 02:51:29,239
Consistent upload is important to like one percent of all people. Yeah, that's what I mean

1787
02:51:29,959 --> 02:51:34,860
Is this lined up right?

1788
02:51:34,860 --> 02:51:36,860
Yeah, we're good. It's lined up right

1789
02:51:36,940 --> 02:51:47,559
It's gonna take them 10 years to replace nodes

1790
02:51:47,719 --> 02:51:52,760
What they should be doing is replacing nodes that people are having issues with on a priority because 90 people don't notice

1791
02:51:53,479 --> 02:51:59,000
Yeah, but that's where you run into like total just company like bureaucracy

1792
02:51:59,879 --> 02:52:02,120
They have like a blueprint of where they're going

1793
02:52:02,840 --> 02:52:04,840
And if nothing else matters

1794
02:52:05,659 --> 02:52:07,659
It's just company bureaucracy

1795
02:52:08,299 --> 02:52:09,659
That's all it is

1796
02:52:09,659 --> 02:52:14,170
Hey, this node is kind of like might need some work might need to be replaced or split

1797
02:52:15,420 --> 02:52:18,239
No, that's not that's no, that's that one's like in 2024

1798
02:52:20,520 --> 02:52:22,440
Invisible line shit

1799
02:52:22,440 --> 02:52:28,120
I'll get the little piece of tape and do that after i'll do it right now. I'll do it right now. I got it

1800
02:52:28,120 --> 02:52:30,489
I got I got the line. I'll do it

1801
02:52:32,399 --> 02:52:34,399
No, no, no, no, it's uh

1802
02:52:34,879 --> 02:52:39,200
No, it's turf turf not tape not turd. No, not a turd

1803
02:52:41,760 --> 02:52:50,440
turf

1804
02:52:50,440 --> 02:52:52,440
This is so pathetic

1805
02:53:05,079 --> 02:53:07,079
This is a turd

1806
02:53:08,750 --> 02:53:13,319
Oh man

1807
02:53:13,319 --> 02:53:15,760
anyways, uh

1808
02:53:16,670 --> 02:53:19,469
The worst part about it is that there are people that are on the ground

1809
02:53:20,430 --> 02:53:23,709
Whether they're technicians or supervisors that that will tell you

1810
02:53:24,750 --> 02:53:28,670
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, this is like bad or like yeah, they're not gonna replace this. It's not gonna happen

1811
02:53:29,309 --> 02:53:36,729
It's like there's like four different companies that are talking to each other that are like different branches of the set is weird

1812
02:53:41,840 --> 02:53:43,440
It's just really odd

1813
02:53:43,440 --> 02:53:46,889
Let's get a big one here big roll

1814
02:53:48,670 --> 02:53:50,670
No visible lines this time

1815
02:53:51,930 --> 02:53:58,030
Uh

1816
02:53:58,030 --> 02:54:00,030
All right, let's get these rolled out

1817
02:54:05,159 --> 02:54:09,899
Fuck I thought I

1818
02:54:10,139 --> 02:54:18,600
It's all right. What's my end game here?

1819
02:54:19,959 --> 02:54:22,200
to roll out grass

1820
02:54:22,200 --> 02:54:23,399
and then put

1821
02:54:23,399 --> 02:54:26,200
um a flower bed and a swing set

1822
02:54:31,069 --> 02:54:34,909
Come on, don't hit the side. Don't hit the side. Don't hit the tree. Don't hit the tree. Don't hit the tree. Don't ah

1823
02:54:51,100 --> 02:54:53,100
And here's another thing. That's kind of sad

1824
02:54:53,930 --> 02:54:59,739
Even with fiber you can still have something called a noise floor

1825
02:55:01,479 --> 02:55:04,920
People can just dump junk into the network

1826
02:55:06,639 --> 02:55:12,840
Sometimes it doesn't matter if you even if you have like a thousand a thousand which is that's what's available

1827
02:55:12,840 --> 02:55:14,840
Will you have fiber a lot of times?

1828
02:55:18,440 --> 02:55:22,120
This guy told me a story of how somebody had like a halogen light bulb

1829
02:55:23,520 --> 02:55:25,280
That was

1830
02:55:25,280 --> 02:55:27,280
And like fucking up the network years ago

1831
02:55:28,190 --> 02:55:34,909
Somebody he also told me about somebody that something as simple as a a modem not being screwed in tight enough

1832
02:55:36,040 --> 02:55:42,639
Can pump noise into the node and it's like a what what?

1833
02:55:43,280 --> 02:55:52,059
It's almost seems like why how how why is that even possible? Why would that even be a thing that could happen?

1834
02:56:01,270 --> 02:56:05,129
Electrical and veterans. Yeah. No, that's real. Apparently that's real

1835
02:56:05,690 --> 02:56:10,319
Halogen bulbs are really bad for interference. Yeah, I don't that's what I mean

1836
02:56:11,469 --> 02:56:15,709
so when you have like thousands and thousands of thousands of customers and one guy

1837
02:56:16,989 --> 02:56:18,040
like

1838
02:56:18,040 --> 02:56:22,120
has an aquarium in his living room and turns on a bulb or something and

1839
02:56:22,760 --> 02:56:40,620
Buzzes out the node. What do you do? What the hell are you supposed to do? Is that gonna hit better not?

1840
02:56:45,690 --> 02:56:51,209
For fiber any light getting into the cable can basically destroy the whole line. Yeah, it's fucking bonkers

1841
02:56:52,010 --> 02:57:02,569
but you essentially you roll any any

1842
02:57:03,209 --> 02:57:07,290
Internet that you have especially in north america you you're kind of just rolling the dice

1843
02:57:07,850 --> 02:57:10,170
So if you're gonna get a connection that's not gonna have any

1844
02:57:10,809 --> 02:57:12,809
really any major

1845
02:57:13,209 --> 02:57:17,180
interference problems

1846
02:57:17,180 --> 02:57:20,620
And then, you know, sometimes you just get unlucky like like I have

1847
02:57:21,739 --> 02:57:26,059
and even in two different parts of the whole country you have like interference and kind of

1848
02:57:27,340 --> 02:57:33,149
bad node issues

1849
02:57:33,149 --> 02:57:35,870
No, no, i'm not gonna do i'm not gonna hit anything with a hammer. I promise

1850
02:57:44,649 --> 02:57:45,690
No

1851
02:57:45,690 --> 02:57:47,690
No, please

1852
02:57:47,850 --> 02:57:49,530
No

1853
02:57:49,530 --> 02:57:52,010
Cut this tree down just uproot it and move it over there

1854
02:58:00,379 --> 02:58:05,340
And we've had the conversation before it's like, oh just move to here. Just just move to here

1855
02:58:06,139 --> 02:58:13,690
Yeah, I I I like it here, you know, I I like I wanted to live here. I wanted to move here

1856
02:58:14,170 --> 02:58:16,170
This is like where I wanted to live

1857
02:58:16,250 --> 02:58:27,870
Are you overlapping the terse? Is that wasting money?

1858
02:58:28,750 --> 02:58:30,750
Uh, yes, uh probably is definitely

1859
02:58:31,229 --> 02:58:42,459
I would say a hundred percent it is because vegas is a is that a line?

1860
02:58:46,649 --> 02:58:48,649
That's that's a visible line right here, isn't it?

1861
02:58:52,680 --> 02:58:54,680
Uh vegas is a 24-hour city

1862
02:58:55,239 --> 02:58:56,120
so

1863
02:58:56,120 --> 02:58:57,319
you know you

1864
02:58:57,399 --> 02:59:01,959
Up late at night or you're doing something you can go get food. You can go do something you can

1865
02:59:03,360 --> 02:59:05,360
You know something as simple as

1866
02:59:05,520 --> 02:59:08,879
Just getting like something to eat at 12 1 2 o'clock in the morning

1867
02:59:10,520 --> 02:59:12,520
Is it just the texture?

1868
02:59:13,559 --> 02:59:17,319
Vegas doesn't turn off. It's literally 20 everything is open 24 hours

1869
02:59:18,040 --> 02:59:19,319
so it's

1870
02:59:19,319 --> 02:59:21,079
It's great

1871
02:59:21,079 --> 02:59:22,440
especially

1872
02:59:22,440 --> 02:59:25,159
Um if you're a person that's like a up late at night all the time

1873
02:59:25,719 --> 02:59:30,670
There's tons of shit to do tons of shit to see it's great

1874
02:59:35,629 --> 02:59:39,950
Well, yeah, not everything not everything but most things that you want are open

1875
02:59:42,280 --> 02:59:44,360
Turn vegas. Oh, actually I asked

1876
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:50,250
I asked that you said turn vegas on and off again. I asked that question to the guy this morning. I said

1877
02:59:50,889 --> 02:59:52,889
Can you just like reboot the node?

1878
02:59:54,120 --> 02:59:59,159
And he's like, I can't do that. We would turn off like a thousand like customers. No, that's not gonna happen

1879
02:59:59,479 --> 03:00:01,239
And i'm just like I can

1880
03:00:01,239 --> 03:00:06,239
You can't just restart it and to see if it helps who's gonna notice

1881
03:00:07,180 --> 03:00:10,940
Yeah, like your episode of doctor who is gonna freeze for 10 seconds like who cares

1882
03:00:11,739 --> 03:00:18,190
That person's not gonna know just try it

1883
03:00:18,750 --> 03:00:23,340
turn off

1884
03:00:23,340 --> 03:00:26,059
Vegas just flip the switch on and off once

1885
03:00:26,700 --> 03:00:33,260
What was I doing?

1886
03:00:33,260 --> 03:00:35,260
Turf I want to turf right? Yeah

1887
03:00:35,579 --> 03:00:38,649
Let's lay these out

1888
03:00:38,649 --> 03:00:40,409
This one right here

1889
03:00:40,409 --> 03:00:44,510
And then right here

1890
03:00:44,829 --> 03:00:50,600
It's almost like I need to have them overlap a little bit just so I don't get a line

1891
03:00:51,479 --> 03:00:56,040
I'm gonna do this one first. Remember I have to do it in this order

1892
03:00:58,799 --> 03:01:00,799
Okay, let's do that fucking tree

1893
03:01:04,010 --> 03:01:06,090
Vegas is down for scheduled maintenance

1894
03:01:06,729 --> 03:01:10,760
Am I no, no, I'm not leaving vegas. No

1895
03:01:11,770 --> 03:01:14,889
But fiber is like being built up here all over the place

1896
03:01:17,079 --> 03:01:19,639
There's a lot of new shit a lot of new developments that weren't here

1897
03:01:30,969 --> 03:01:32,969
But why do I like vegas? I just like the

1898
03:01:34,270 --> 03:01:36,430
It's mainly just the 24-hour atmosphere

1899
03:01:37,149 --> 03:01:42,200
Because you know, you guys know sometimes i'll be streaming and sometimes the streams will go to

1900
03:01:43,319 --> 03:01:44,760
10 11 12

1901
03:01:44,760 --> 03:01:46,440
a.m pacific

1902
03:01:46,440 --> 03:01:51,479
And I remember I hadn't like eaten anything really all day. I hadn't really done anything all day. So that's like my time

1903
03:01:52,719 --> 03:01:57,280
Offstream to like even go get food go to the grocery store. You know that that's

1904
03:01:59,389 --> 03:02:02,350
You know if I if I go to sleep at like two three four o'clock in the morning

1905
03:02:05,049 --> 03:02:09,209
It's just stuff is available. All right, that looks good

1906
03:02:12,409 --> 03:02:14,409
No, I mean we make food at home all the time

1907
03:02:15,129 --> 03:02:19,690
Have you seen the plates of food that I that I have from kim does great but making food

1908
03:02:19,690 --> 03:02:21,770
I make food too. I've got a great recipe

1909
03:02:23,229 --> 03:02:27,260
Sell the trees, uh, I don't think I can these are just permanent fixtures

1910
03:02:29,870 --> 03:02:32,219
Turn your flashlight off

1911
03:02:32,219 --> 03:02:34,219
It's got a I got a recipe or two

1912
03:02:40,750 --> 03:02:41,549
um

1913
03:02:41,549 --> 03:02:44,569
Okay, hold on a minute here. I'm gonna give you a countdown

1914
03:02:48,440 --> 03:02:50,520
It's gonna be really loud. Just make sure you know

1915
03:02:52,920 --> 03:02:53,799
one

1916
03:02:53,799 --> 03:02:57,079
Up if you don't know if you came to the stream or later

1917
03:02:57,879 --> 03:03:00,280
This is louder than anything in the whole game and I can't turn it down

1918
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:02,600
so

1919
03:03:02,600 --> 03:03:06,360
Uh turn your volume down a lot because it's gonna blow out your microphone

1920
03:03:07,819 --> 03:03:08,879
one

1921
03:03:08,879 --> 03:03:09,840
two

1922
03:03:09,840 --> 03:03:12,540
three

1923
03:03:12,540 --> 03:03:16,379
I you can't take them down. Never mind. I did that. I might as well water the damn thing

1924
03:03:17,020 --> 03:03:23,370
All right, big roll

1925
03:03:23,370 --> 03:03:26,760
Let's go right here

1926
03:03:26,760 --> 03:03:32,090
But so the but so for instance the internet has stabilized, right?

1927
03:03:34,079 --> 03:03:38,799
It's we're fine. We've been fine for like probably 20 30 minutes straight here. It's just so

1928
03:03:40,219 --> 03:03:42,940
It's like impossible to like find and fix

1929
03:03:43,899 --> 03:03:45,899
It's the saddest truth there is

1930
03:03:55,209 --> 03:03:57,209
Peek your mic. Maybe that'll fix it

1931
03:03:57,450 --> 03:04:02,120
Because those of you that remember back in october

1932
03:04:02,760 --> 03:04:09,440
When we first moved in here, they didn't even work. It was all fucked up tons and tons of problems

1933
03:04:09,440 --> 03:04:11,840
It was it was awful couldn't be used

1934
03:04:13,260 --> 03:04:18,459
And that is a scenario where they fixed it and there was a big big problem that they fixed

1935
03:04:19,100 --> 03:04:21,639
It's not like that anymore

1936
03:04:21,639 --> 03:04:23,879
Just kind of just randomly throughout the day just

1937
03:04:27,149 --> 03:04:31,229
I'm fine. I'm good. Hey, what's going on? What are you using the internet? It's me the internet. I'm fine

1938
03:04:31,629 --> 03:04:46,649
That scared my cat. Oh, I'm so sorry to that little kitty

1939
03:04:47,209 --> 03:04:51,290
What's gas name?

1940
03:04:51,290 --> 03:04:59,739
sprinkles

1941
03:04:59,739 --> 03:05:00,780
george

1942
03:05:00,780 --> 03:05:02,680
Pretty cool cat name

1943
03:05:02,680 --> 03:05:11,440
Was that in the same person?

1944
03:05:16,280 --> 03:05:19,639
Uh, how many how many more of these this is not even real grass

1945
03:05:21,340 --> 03:05:24,540
I'm just coming to the realization here. This shouldn't even real

1946
03:05:25,659 --> 03:05:27,659
I'm laying out a football field

1947
03:05:27,979 --> 03:05:30,159
This is not even actually grass

1948
03:05:34,270 --> 03:05:36,940
What it is

1949
03:05:36,940 --> 03:05:39,760
This is not astroturf

1950
03:05:39,760 --> 03:05:49,879
It's topsoil

1951
03:05:49,879 --> 03:05:54,540
They sell this shit at like the home depot by the roll. Is this how you make grass?

1952
03:06:06,750 --> 03:06:09,629
Yes, I mean, yeah only if you want it quickly

1953
03:06:10,430 --> 03:06:12,430
No, this is not the real thing

1954
03:06:13,049 --> 03:06:16,729
you plant seeds in the ground and water it and

1955
03:06:17,610 --> 03:06:19,049
No, this is like

1956
03:06:19,049 --> 03:06:21,440
This is not real grass

1957
03:06:21,440 --> 03:06:34,190
You still using seeds. Yeah, that's the natural way

1958
03:06:35,290 --> 03:06:46,940
There's a line there

1959
03:06:46,940 --> 03:06:48,700
Come on. Oh

1960
03:06:48,700 --> 03:07:11,260
That felt so good. Did you see how good that felt? I got it. I got it

1961
03:07:11,340 --> 03:07:13,340
I mean, I missed it, but I got it. I'm good

1962
03:07:13,819 --> 03:07:20,840
But this is bothering me though. Why can I not remove these that's bothering me?

1963
03:07:21,399 --> 03:07:23,399
Can I take the little tape the roll of tape and do it?

1964
03:07:31,440 --> 03:07:35,360
Shit, come on really

1965
03:07:35,360 --> 03:07:41,879
It is a bother

1966
03:07:41,879 --> 03:07:43,639
I wasted it

1967
03:07:43,639 --> 03:07:56,139
I mean maybe a little bit. Can you put the maybe chips around the trees?

1968
03:07:56,780 --> 03:08:00,200
I'll try that

1969
03:08:00,200 --> 03:08:04,760
How much is this actually costing a lot of money what I for oh, no, that's not that much money

1970
03:08:11,709 --> 03:08:13,760
Missed

1971
03:08:13,760 --> 03:08:16,670
Wait, wait, wait, I'll do it this way

1972
03:08:16,670 --> 03:08:18,670
I didn't really miss

1973
03:08:19,530 --> 03:08:21,530
Didn't really hit it either though

1974
03:08:24,670 --> 03:08:27,549
Stream stream later in the day try to stay away from the prime time

1975
03:08:29,520 --> 03:08:31,920
it's it's just it's tough it really is because

1976
03:08:32,799 --> 03:08:36,989
I if you stick it if I let's say I started it like

1977
03:08:37,629 --> 03:08:40,829
seven eight nine o'clock pacific time, that's so

1978
03:08:41,770 --> 03:08:44,190
Unbearably late for so many people

1979
03:08:46,479 --> 03:08:51,840
And then on the same thing if you stream at you know, six o'clock in the morning seven o'clock in the morning pacific

1980
03:08:51,920 --> 03:08:56,879
It's just screwing it up for half the other. It's it's kind of it's difficult to try to figure out that right spot

1981
03:09:00,559 --> 03:09:04,510
But I I don't I can't really stream

1982
03:09:05,229 --> 03:09:07,049
at

1983
03:09:07,049 --> 03:09:09,290
Like fucking eight o'clock in the morning. I can't

1984
03:09:10,170 --> 03:09:12,409
I don't think I don't have the energy to do it

1985
03:09:12,409 --> 03:09:16,889
I don't I can't like get into whatever i'm talking fucking I I don't like wake up really

1986
03:09:17,209 --> 03:09:19,770
It takes me like two hours to sort of get up to like really wake up

1987
03:09:24,639 --> 03:09:26,159
and i'm at my

1988
03:09:26,159 --> 03:09:29,360
Highest energy levels at like this time right now

1989
03:09:30,559 --> 03:09:32,959
My whole life it's been like that ever since I was like 16

1990
03:09:34,510 --> 03:09:36,510
And I can't change it

1991
03:09:37,930 --> 03:09:40,430
I've tried a million times

1992
03:09:40,430 --> 03:09:44,110
But all through college it was I was peak hours for my brain

1993
03:09:45,069 --> 03:09:47,069
is between like one and

1994
03:09:47,469 --> 03:09:52,750
Five pm really is like where i'm at my highest energy. God damn it. I keep fucking this up

1995
03:09:54,000 --> 03:10:04,540
But I can't even tell who cares

1996
03:10:04,540 --> 03:10:06,780
You were born a 16 year old

1997
03:10:07,340 --> 03:10:09,340
No, i'm just saying like I I have

1998
03:10:10,559 --> 03:10:12,799
Even if I get up in the morning for weeks

1999
03:10:13,520 --> 03:10:16,280
I'm still a slug

2000
03:10:16,280 --> 03:10:17,879
I think i'm one of those like

2001
03:10:17,879 --> 03:10:20,510
I mean, I don't really abide by like the

2002
03:10:20,909 --> 03:10:22,909
energy fields and stuff

2003
03:10:23,549 --> 03:10:25,469
but

2004
03:10:25,469 --> 03:10:30,299
Is there like a do you just can you get like power from the moon?

2005
03:10:32,219 --> 03:10:34,219
Will you roll past the tree?

2006
03:10:38,889 --> 03:10:41,290
Can you be like a moon person and not like a sun person?

2007
03:10:48,190 --> 03:10:50,190
Okay, why is this not working?

2008
03:10:52,600 --> 03:10:56,329
This is gonna drive me crazy

2009
03:10:56,329 --> 03:11:03,819
Oh my god, why?

2010
03:11:03,899 --> 03:11:09,639
I I can't get this

2011
03:11:09,639 --> 03:11:21,899
Nope, i'll put flowers there. That's okay. Yeah, i'll put a flower there. It'll be fine. Oh, look at this

2012
03:11:24,120 --> 03:11:26,120
Ah nice. Oh, I like this

2013
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:29,000
Very cool. Very excellent. I think

2014
03:11:39,040 --> 03:11:41,719
Yeah, I would say that's excellent

2015
03:11:41,719 --> 03:11:44,680
I mean, I know i'm patting myself on the back there, but I think that's kind of excellent

2016
03:11:46,170 --> 03:11:51,260
No, I need the big one

2017
03:11:51,260 --> 03:11:53,579
but

2018
03:11:53,579 --> 03:11:55,899
Internet, I mean, we're just having a conversation here

2019
03:11:57,920 --> 03:11:59,920
Apparently having a static ip

2020
03:12:00,760 --> 03:12:02,360
will

2021
03:12:02,360 --> 03:12:04,379
Help apparently

2022
03:12:04,379 --> 03:12:06,379
I got a line here on the left

2023
03:12:06,459 --> 03:12:17,559
And it's weird

2024
03:12:17,559 --> 03:12:20,200
Because I don't know if anybody knows anything about networking in here. Maybe you do

2025
03:12:21,399 --> 03:12:23,399
So I need someone to explain this to me

2026
03:12:25,069 --> 03:12:28,989
If you if you do then just chime in this is open forum chime in

2027
03:12:30,489 --> 03:12:32,010
The guy on the ground

2028
03:12:32,010 --> 03:12:33,690
Like the guy in the truck

2029
03:12:33,690 --> 03:12:36,569
The dude that does all the networking shit

2030
03:12:38,010 --> 03:12:40,569
Told me that having a static ip

2031
03:12:42,090 --> 03:12:43,930
actually somehow

2032
03:12:43,930 --> 03:12:45,850
makes your

2033
03:12:45,850 --> 03:12:47,290
traffic

2034
03:12:47,290 --> 03:12:49,290
Like a higher priority in the node

2035
03:12:52,280 --> 03:12:53,399
is

2036
03:12:53,399 --> 03:12:55,879
Doubt I would that's what I was told that it was possible that I could help

2037
03:13:01,049 --> 03:13:07,840
Doubt it static if he does nothing but I mean, but this is somebody that is

2038
03:13:08,719 --> 03:13:19,440
Am I gonna what's going on here? Is it stuck on the tree? Did I pay for this? No

2039
03:13:20,590 --> 03:13:23,549
I have a business package. So it all support is

2040
03:13:24,590 --> 03:13:37,870
There it's possible to have their qos set differently depending on address assignment

2041
03:13:38,430 --> 03:13:43,450
It's possible that because from what he was explaining to me

2042
03:13:44,809 --> 03:13:46,239
is

2043
03:13:46,239 --> 03:13:48,670
Because it's static

2044
03:13:49,309 --> 03:13:51,549
The cox just has rip

2045
03:13:52,430 --> 03:13:58,590
And it never changes and they know exactly where it is and exactly the dns. It doesn't change at all ever

2046
03:13:59,069 --> 03:14:03,209
You'd be saying it to calm me down

2047
03:14:03,770 --> 03:14:07,530
I wasn't like a raving lunatic when this person came

2048
03:14:10,010 --> 03:14:22,670
All right, calm down, sir. Let me tell you it got just easy. I'm not like a maniac

2049
03:14:26,299 --> 03:14:30,700
but so that's what the guy and and this was the person who was responsible for

2050
03:14:31,899 --> 03:14:35,180
like maintenance and monitoring all these networks

2051
03:14:36,440 --> 03:14:41,479
And then the guy on the phone like just the tech support guy said no, that's not true

2052
03:14:44,989 --> 03:14:46,430
So which one is it?

2053
03:14:46,430 --> 03:15:03,149
It's like they have like five different scripts for different scenarios. Like which what's the real what can somebody just tell me the truth?

2054
03:15:03,950 --> 03:15:05,950
Can somebody please help me?

2055
03:15:06,350 --> 03:15:16,600
We already yeah. No, we we've been on the business package. Ah, damn it. I missed it. No, I didn't I no I got it

2056
03:15:17,239 --> 03:15:19,680
We've been on business business this whole time

2057
03:15:26,030 --> 03:15:28,030
But it's almost like I don't know who to trust

2058
03:15:28,510 --> 03:15:30,750
It's like I have a telltale choice

2059
03:15:34,270 --> 03:15:36,430
Who's the one that i'm gonna like go with?

2060
03:15:48,860 --> 03:15:53,319
Me we're almost I almost have a legitimate yard here

2061
03:15:59,280 --> 03:16:04,639
Dude, like all these isps are so all over the place. It's so fucked. I remember when I first called

2062
03:16:05,440 --> 03:16:09,229
To like set up a business package and I said does business have priority

2063
03:16:09,870 --> 03:16:11,469
over residential

2064
03:16:11,469 --> 03:16:13,450
Yeah

2065
03:16:13,450 --> 03:16:15,770
Uh, okay. Cool. That's pretty cool

2066
03:16:16,489 --> 03:16:20,090
And then like three days later I was told no, that's not true who told you that

2067
03:16:21,579 --> 03:16:24,620
Who the fuck is running shit over there? Like what's going on?

2068
03:16:30,219 --> 03:16:32,219
it's just like we have like

2069
03:16:33,000 --> 03:16:35,000
12,000 employees and

2070
03:16:36,510 --> 03:16:41,100
All of them are not on the same page ever. What the fuck

2071
03:17:00,159 --> 03:17:03,440
He's going out. He's getting into another episode. No, no, no, i'm fine. I'm fine. I'm good

2072
03:17:03,520 --> 03:17:05,840
Wait, i'm gonna do this because it's cost effective

2073
03:17:10,670 --> 03:17:13,469
Static ip is an address for you specifically doesn't give you priority

2074
03:17:13,469 --> 03:17:17,069
But it does give them a direct point to know it's you rather than the guy down the street because when wait

2075
03:17:17,149 --> 03:17:19,149
That was a that was a one guy statement

2076
03:17:20,319 --> 03:17:24,639
Because when you connect to the internet the isp gives you a different ip every time you connect imagine having a street address

2077
03:17:24,639 --> 03:17:27,760
That changes every time you mail a letter as opposed to a fixed number so they know it's you

2078
03:17:29,120 --> 03:17:45,020
Well, let's see if it does anything

2079
03:17:45,020 --> 03:17:49,770
Do I have to water the grass?

2080
03:17:49,770 --> 03:17:51,049
Can I get these both?

2081
03:17:51,049 --> 03:17:53,049
I'm thinking one go. Let's try it

2082
03:17:53,209 --> 03:17:55,209
I'm gonna try it. I hope I get it

2083
03:18:02,430 --> 03:18:04,829
All right, let's try it again if I don't get it this time

2084
03:18:04,829 --> 03:18:07,389
I swear to god i'm fucking canceling my wow subscription

2085
03:18:12,170 --> 03:18:14,729
Ah, it's cancelled. Fuck it. I don't want to play it anymore

2086
03:18:22,840 --> 03:18:26,360
No, don't don't do it

2087
03:18:26,360 --> 03:18:29,559
Is classic wow going to be a separate subscription than regular? Wow?

2088
03:18:30,280 --> 03:18:34,440
Does anybody have any idea is it gonna be two different games or is it just gonna be two different clients?

2089
03:18:34,440 --> 03:18:46,559
How's it gonna work?

2090
03:18:46,559 --> 03:18:48,559
Oh, okay. That's cool

2091
03:18:48,959 --> 03:18:55,159
All right, we're almost done with the yard

2092
03:19:01,770 --> 03:19:07,290
Uh, i'm just putting plants around these i'm done with this shit. I ain't doing that anymore one more here

2093
03:19:08,010 --> 03:19:10,729
Like one more right here and then we're covering this with bushes

2094
03:19:27,520 --> 03:19:30,479
Ah, it's always so misleading to me. Come on

2095
03:19:33,100 --> 03:19:34,700
I got the money. It's all right

2096
03:19:34,700 --> 03:19:40,350
All right one last one. It's I this is too addicting to just do this shit

2097
03:19:41,450 --> 03:19:48,079
That's it

2098
03:19:48,079 --> 03:19:50,079
Nice. All right, let's get in there

2099
03:19:51,549 --> 03:19:54,430
All right. I don't care about the front here. I'll put like a welcome mat or something

2100
03:19:55,760 --> 03:19:57,760
Oh, there's so much more to do

2101
03:19:57,840 --> 03:20:01,290
Look at how much more there is to do

2102
03:20:01,370 --> 03:20:03,610
There's so many more things to do

2103
03:20:05,760 --> 03:20:06,959
Uh

2104
03:20:06,959 --> 03:20:10,000
I think I could get him

2105
03:20:10,000 --> 03:20:12,399
Let's try this i'm gonna try to just plan it out

2106
03:20:22,079 --> 03:20:24,079
Look, it's can't be it's not gonna be perfect

2107
03:20:28,879 --> 03:20:30,879
I wonder if that's lined up right? Who knows?

2108
03:20:31,200 --> 03:20:41,440
It doesn't have to be perfect. Just get it right

2109
03:20:42,000 --> 03:20:44,879
Okay, what's the furthest one this one? No, this one

2110
03:20:45,760 --> 03:21:00,219
Wait, what turf drive?

2111
03:21:02,280 --> 03:21:04,280
What do you mean turf driveway?

2112
03:21:14,040 --> 03:21:16,280
Well, look at this like grasses here. Ah

2113
03:21:17,239 --> 03:21:39,049
I have to do these though. Yeah, I can gravel over it. It'll be fine. Hey you turf them where the driveway goes mate

2114
03:21:43,739 --> 03:21:46,379
Just turf. Yeah, i'm gonna turf the inside

2115
03:21:46,940 --> 03:21:49,180
I'm gonna have a grass house

2116
03:21:51,260 --> 03:22:08,350
It's better than it's cheaper than carpet here come the ants

2117
03:22:15,079 --> 03:22:20,280
All right. I don't I i'm I need to do. Yeah, the driveway is this but there needs to be you know

2118
03:22:20,280 --> 03:22:22,280
What I can just I can i'll fix it in post

2119
03:22:22,840 --> 03:22:24,440
Yeah, i'll fix it in post

2120
03:22:24,440 --> 03:22:26,879
Don't worry about any of this shit

2121
03:22:26,879 --> 03:22:28,879
Get rid of all this i'll fix it in post

2122
03:22:29,600 --> 03:22:41,500
That's all except for this one and maybe this one and this no i'll fix this in post production

2123
03:22:42,219 --> 03:22:49,200
All right. How's the house look?

2124
03:22:49,200 --> 03:22:52,430
All right. Um

2125
03:22:52,430 --> 03:22:56,270
Okay, here it comes here. I I don't want this. I don't want this wall here

2126
03:22:56,909 --> 03:23:01,559
That's like is it the garage?

2127
03:23:01,559 --> 03:23:10,520
Here we go

2128
03:23:10,520 --> 03:23:12,329
You ready?

2129
03:23:12,329 --> 03:23:13,370
three

2130
03:23:13,370 --> 03:23:14,329
two

2131
03:23:14,329 --> 03:23:30,059
One it's gonna be loud turn your volume down if you haven't already loud just keep your volume down

2132
03:23:37,440 --> 03:23:40,559
Keep your volume down. I'm serious. Don't turn it up

2133
03:23:43,309 --> 03:23:54,829
This is as serious as i'm going to be

2134
03:23:55,069 --> 03:24:03,450
Why are you doing this to the garage?

2135
03:24:03,530 --> 03:24:06,030
It's really important that you see this in a minute

2136
03:24:07,770 --> 03:24:27,000
I have a vision that the noise doesn't happen when you do it too much in succession. It doesn't have to random

2137
03:24:27,879 --> 03:24:39,719
sick

2138
03:24:39,959 --> 03:24:48,079
Frank I can't hear you. Okay, I can you can probably hear me now

2139
03:24:49,760 --> 03:24:59,840
Okay, you can hold on let me just take a look at what I did here, okay

2140
03:25:02,639 --> 03:25:03,680
All right

2141
03:25:03,680 --> 03:25:07,440
There's blood everywhere

2142
03:25:07,440 --> 03:25:14,010
Let's clean this up a little bit

2143
03:25:14,010 --> 03:25:17,129
All right. I'm not i'm you can turn the volume back up a little bit. I'm not loud anymore

2144
03:25:23,100 --> 03:25:27,420
I've got a great idea. There's some trash to remove. I just opened the door for the first time. Will you relax?

2145
03:25:28,219 --> 03:25:32,059
A person with like 30 people in their family. You can't even fit everybody in the same picture

2146
03:25:32,780 --> 03:25:37,389
I've ruined my painting. Why did you do this?

2147
03:25:39,120 --> 03:25:42,319
Just control z like everyone else was you just yelling

2148
03:25:42,959 --> 03:25:48,360
Got some bugs over there

2149
03:25:48,360 --> 03:25:50,680
Was it what's it back? Don't you get like a vacuum cleaner?

2150
03:25:51,079 --> 03:26:06,559
So you can't sell the bugs, okay, that's good

2151
03:26:07,840 --> 03:26:15,709
Got some the glass

2152
03:26:15,790 --> 03:26:17,790
All right. So we got a little house here

2153
03:26:18,590 --> 03:26:20,270
Hold on. Let me think

2154
03:26:20,270 --> 03:26:23,280
I have an idea what's over here

2155
03:26:23,680 --> 03:26:27,600
What the fuck is this? Why are there like two why the three garages?

2156
03:26:31,959 --> 03:26:33,959
All right. So these are the garages. Okay

2157
03:26:40,809 --> 03:26:51,600
One two three

2158
03:26:51,600 --> 03:26:55,040
Clean up these first so we can get make sure we get a three car garage in here

2159
03:26:55,760 --> 03:27:00,440
How's this dirt looking pretty dirty

2160
03:27:01,000 --> 03:27:06,000
Okay, so one two three

2161
03:27:06,559 --> 03:27:09,760
What that actually do it I can clean from back here

2162
03:27:13,610 --> 03:27:15,530
You actually can

2163
03:27:15,530 --> 03:27:17,530
But I can't go inside with this

2164
03:27:17,690 --> 03:27:31,870
Can I clean the window? Let's clean the window here clean. Come on

2165
03:27:33,309 --> 03:27:34,649
E

He saw himself with the revolver in his head

2337
03:46:30,079 --> 03:46:32,959
And it was that's what's happening. I hate this

2338
03:46:35,950 --> 03:46:38,459

2339
03:46:38,459 --> 03:47:02,989

2340
03:47:06,110 --> 03:47:11,040
Damn it. Why does it have to be that loud? I don't understand. It doesn't

2341
03:47:11,760 --> 03:47:12,719
No

2342
03:47:12,719 --> 03:47:13,760
Shit

2343
03:47:13,760 --> 03:47:15,760
It's okay. It's okay. I didn't break anything

2344
03:47:16,479 --> 03:47:19,610
I did break something

2345
03:47:19,610 --> 03:47:22,649
What a waste of pain. Look at my balance didn't even make a dent

2346
03:47:23,370 --> 03:47:27,659
I'm sorry loud again three two

2347
03:47:32,280 --> 03:47:34,280
Terrible still

2348
03:47:34,280 --> 03:47:36,040
I almost need to I don't know what I need to do

2349
03:47:36,040 --> 03:47:39,000
It's like the way that these doors are set up it's the doors too

2350
03:47:40,059 --> 03:47:42,459
It's these doors. It's like the brown door

2351
03:47:44,250 --> 03:47:47,180
They need to be different

2352
03:47:47,180 --> 03:47:49,819
It's just like i'm walking through no cover this up

2353
03:47:54,409 --> 03:47:56,409
I need lights on the ceiling

2354
03:47:58,329 --> 03:48:03,209
That's definitely what it is lamps

2355
03:48:04,360 --> 03:48:08,250

2356
03:48:08,250 --> 03:48:10,250

03:48:11,309 --> 03:48:14,110
Oh, I like the brass by many of them

2358
03:48:22,079 --> 03:48:36,569
I don't know what's going on. I gotta get out of this room too many doors. It's just too many doors

2359
03:48:37,049 --> 03:48:45,659
I think it's where the window is

2360
03:48:45,659 --> 03:48:47,260
This house is cursed

2361
03:48:47,260 --> 03:48:51,680
Okay, i'm i'm setting one down. It's the lighting

2362
03:48:53,340 --> 03:48:55,819
Okay, I just need to paint the walls like blue

2363
03:48:56,700 --> 03:48:58,750
And then I can and we find

2364
03:48:58,750 --> 03:49:01,280
walls

2365
03:49:01,280 --> 03:49:04,280

2370
03:49:21,239 --> 03:49:22,360
It really will

2371
03:49:22,360 --> 03:49:48,239
The fuck do I use this? All right, I started to feel better a little bit

2372
03:50:15,450 --> 03:50:18,590
Somebody said this is a fast food bathroom

2373
03:50:24,879 --> 03:50:27,760
Yeah, this is like a long john silvers bathroom

2374
03:50:41,719 --> 03:50:43,719
Anything is better than

2375
03:50:44,940 --> 03:51:00,700
Pt tiling

2376
03:51:00,700 --> 03:51:04,729
No, no, I don't like it. What's wrong with me right now

2377
03:51:09,719 --> 03:51:12,360
Pt I just saw pt tile

2378
03:51:12,920 --> 03:51:37,209
Package pt the room's too narrow. I can't add windows. I can only have one window here

2379
03:51:37,770 --> 03:51:39,920
I'm just gonna do paint. I'm gonna do

2380
03:51:40,879 --> 03:51:42,889

2381
03:51:42,889 --> 03:51:47,129
Spring I feel like this will spring grass. This is the one. This is absolutely the one

2382
03:51:47,610 --> 03:51:49,690
I think i'll be able to fucking relax after this one

2383
03:51:50,329 --> 03:51:57,309
Let's test it

2384
03:51:57,309 --> 03:51:59,469
Yeah, okay. I already feel a little bit better

2385
03:52:02,360 --> 03:52:04,360
This is a clown house

2386
03:52:13,760 --> 03:52:15,760
Okay, I feel great

2387
03:52:16,700 --> 03:52:18,940
Green, I think green is just me. It's just me

2388
03:52:20,350 --> 03:52:22,350
Yeah, I feel fantastic right now

2389
03:52:23,229 --> 03:52:35,129
This has got to go though. I hate that

2390
03:52:57,930 --> 03:52:59,930
You're turfing the room

2391
03:53:00,620 --> 03:53:06,879
That's all right

2392
03:53:06,879 --> 03:53:08,879
That's better for me

2393
03:53:09,500 --> 03:53:11,659
It's the bottom say the ground is fucking me up

2394
03:53:16,219 --> 03:53:17,500
It's 3d

2395
03:53:17,500 --> 03:53:27,770
I need some rugs

2396
03:53:27,770 --> 03:53:32,639
Let me see one of these maybe

2397
03:53:33,340 --> 03:53:35,340
Just rectangles. Let's see

2398
03:53:39,479 --> 03:53:41,639
Look at that much better. Oh much better

2399
03:54:01,079 --> 03:54:03,639
Okay

2400
03:54:03,639 --> 03:54:05,950
It was the floors on the tile

2401
03:54:05,950 --> 03:54:08,510
It was the tile. Yeah, the floor tiles would just

2402
03:54:09,790 --> 03:54:11,790
They were fucking up my brain

2403
03:54:13,690 --> 03:54:18,409
Okay, uh, this has to be dealt with though. So I apologize, but you're gonna be loud again one

2404
03:54:19,959 --> 03:54:22,459
two

2405
03:54:22,459 --> 03:54:28,600
Three this is the only thing I hit right?

2406
03:54:29,239 --> 03:54:32,329
All here

03:54:32,329 --> 03:54:38,680
All right, get the paint did I delete the paint?

2408
03:54:39,559 --> 03:54:46,600

Ceramic green

2410
03:54:48,280 --> 03:54:54,680
Which one this one? All right

2411
03:54:57,069 --> 03:54:58,270
I mean it is

2412
03:54:58,270 --> 03:55:00,270
This is a this is a nickelodeon sprite room

2413
03:55:01,399 --> 03:55:02,840
But it's okay

2414
03:55:02,840 --> 03:55:15,129
This is like a slime room. I'm okay with the nickelodeon room

2415
03:55:19,229 --> 03:55:28,170
All right. Looks good

2416
03:55:28,170 --> 03:55:30,649
Yeah, i'll keep the ecto cooler room

2417
03:55:31,290 --> 03:55:33,290
Yeah, I said ecto cooler. I know

03:55:33,530 --> 03:55:49,069
He's making nickelodeon studios. Well, not quite

2419
03:55:50,760 --> 03:55:52,520
Okay, so

2420
03:55:52,520 --> 03:56:23,209
You can't do it

2421
03:56:23,209 --> 03:56:27,239
You can't roll it in the house

2422
03:56:27,239 --> 03:56:30,700
Sorry guys

2423
03:56:32,299 --> 03:56:38,329
I tried I did make an attempt and what about I wanted to do the garden first

2424
03:56:39,290 --> 03:56:52,170
But I need to be daytime. This needs to be paved

2425
03:56:53,049 --> 03:56:54,649
Pave this

2426
03:56:54,649 --> 03:56:58,280
Is it like pavement?

2427
03:56:58,280 --> 03:57:00,040
paved

2428
03:57:00,040 --> 03:57:02,700
gravel

2429
03:57:02,700 --> 03:57:04,350
surfaces

2430
03:57:04,350 --> 03:57:06,139
All right

2431
03:57:06,139 --> 03:57:07,180
small

2432
03:57:07,180 --> 03:57:08,459
Small grain

2433
03:57:08,459 --> 03:57:24,489
I need to be square

2434
03:57:24,489 --> 03:57:28,639
square

2435
03:57:28,639 --> 03:57:30,079
Small grain

2436
03:57:30,079 --> 03:57:41,280
Just make it a straight. That's what i'm doing

2437
03:57:41,440 --> 03:57:49,500
Not straight

2438
03:57:49,500 --> 03:57:52,379

2439
03:57:52,940 --> 03:58:10,989

03:58:10,989 --> 03:58:17,319
Actually terrible. I I have to paint it

2441
03:58:22,079 --> 03:58:24,079
That's straight. That's fine. That's straight

2442
03:58:29,819 --> 03:58:46,120
Actually terrible it's not perfect. It's rock

2443
03:58:46,680 --> 03:59:00,879
Rock is not perfect. That looks all right

2444
03:59:01,600 --> 03:59:03,600
And then check this out ready

2445
03:59:03,600 --> 03:59:08,000

2449
03:59:18,190 --> 03:59:21,690
broadly spreading bush

2450
03:59:21,690 --> 03:59:23,129
That's not bad

2451
03:59:23,129 --> 03:59:27,229
Oh, I like that

2452
03:59:27,229 --> 03:59:28,909
a dwarf shrub

2453
03:59:28,909 --> 03:59:31,719
How tall is this?

Why is this so tiny what?

2458
03:59:59,600 --> 04:00:02,540
I thought this is a big lamp post

2459
04:00:15,450 --> 04:00:17,209
That is tiny

2460
04:00:17,350 --> 04:00:18,809
surfaces

2461
04:00:18,809 --> 04:00:20,809
wood cuttings

2462
04:00:20,809 --> 04:00:22,250

2463
04:00:22,250 --> 04:00:24,250
Uh, hold on bark

2464
04:00:28,489 --> 04:00:33,120

Why is it here we go check this out. It's gonna be nice

2467
04:00:44,479 --> 04:00:50,540
Told you I was gonna fix this

2468
04:00:56,909 --> 04:01:04,139
Um, I really

2469
04:01:04,780 --> 04:01:06,780
I can't

2470
04:01:13,049 --> 04:01:15,129
I can't why can I not do that?

2471
04:01:22,719 --> 04:01:24,079
I can't

2472
04:01:24,079 --> 04:01:41,819
That's a bit of worse

2473
04:01:41,819 --> 04:01:43,819
I I like the wood chips though

2474
04:01:49,200 --> 04:01:50,639
Wood chip. No

2475
04:01:50,639 --> 04:02:00,840
I'll go back here

2476
04:02:00,840 --> 04:02:02,840
It's got to cover with rocks

2477
04:02:03,000 --> 04:02:16,409
No, I can't make it like a stove. Ooh, but I can do this

2478
04:02:33,290 --> 04:02:36,620
That doesn't look right

2479
04:02:36,940 --> 04:02:38,940
Yes, he's gonna trip on it

2480
04:02:41,799 --> 04:02:45,239
I need to put grass down there. God damn it. All right. Hold on plants

2481
04:02:47,440 --> 04:02:49,370
How about one of these?

2482
04:02:49,370 --> 04:02:51,370
How does it that might be okay?

2483
04:02:52,120 --> 04:02:53,079
Ready?

2484
04:02:53,079 --> 04:03:24,030
You let me know

2485
04:03:24,030 --> 04:03:26,909
I'm not a good direct decorator. I'm really not plants

2486
04:03:28,190 --> 04:03:30,190
bushes a handful bushes

2487
04:03:33,770 --> 04:03:36,110
salvia

2488
04:03:36,110 --> 04:03:39,290
um

2489
04:03:39,290 --> 04:03:40,090
Oh

2490
04:03:40,090 --> 04:03:42,989
This might be okay

2491
04:03:42,989 --> 04:03:46,059
All right. Okay. Hold on a minute here

2492
04:03:46,059 --> 04:03:48,059
What if I do like one here?

2493
04:03:49,579 --> 04:03:53,479
And then one here

2494
04:03:53,479 --> 04:04:05,690
All right, and then there's like another one back here like two or three back here

2495
04:04:15,950 --> 04:04:47,819
I don't hate this

2496
04:04:47,819 --> 04:04:49,899
They're not that tall guys. Relax

2497
04:05:08,379 --> 04:05:11,020
Somehow it's even worse. They're not what are we talking about?

2498
04:05:12,540 --> 04:05:18,809
pubes

2499
04:05:18,809 --> 04:05:23,819
This is fine

2500
04:05:23,819 --> 04:05:26,139
That's all right. And then i'm gonna put like a little flower bed here

2501
04:05:27,530 --> 04:05:29,049
flower bed here

2502
04:05:29,049 --> 04:05:31,049
Flower bed like a couple of flowers

2503
04:05:33,440 --> 04:05:35,680
Why is everybody all crazy right now?

2504
04:05:46,959 --> 04:05:49,120
You can hold your review until after

2505
04:05:54,399 --> 04:06:02,639
It's too close to the driveway for fancy decorations. Not necessarily

2506
04:06:11,440 --> 04:06:13,440
pubes

2507
04:06:14,889 --> 04:06:16,649
Oh my god

2508
04:06:16,649 --> 04:06:18,409
I can't even man

2509
04:06:18,409 --> 04:06:22,190
I can't even

2510
04:06:22,190 --> 04:06:24,190
That looks fine. It looks good

2511
04:06:24,829 --> 04:06:27,799
and then maybe we could do like

2512
04:06:27,799 --> 04:06:32,440
Just one or two little things here one or two little things here and then like maybe a little bed up this way

2513
04:06:33,930 --> 04:06:35,930
It's uneven

2514
04:06:48,430 --> 04:06:49,790

Maybe the front no

2573
04:14:16,090 --> 04:14:18,840
It needs to be a little bit bigger

2574
04:14:18,840 --> 04:14:20,280
Gotta be bigger than that

2575
04:14:20,280 --> 04:14:40,489

Gardening's too hard. I think it just it's gardening's too hard

2582
04:15:33,020 --> 04:15:35,979
I just need to do that's just too time consuming. Why would anybody do this?

2583
04:15:36,540 --> 04:16:01,379
Normally wouldn't over come the parking pathway

2584
04:16:06,620 --> 04:16:25,840
But what if they might because they wanted to look decent on their pull-up rows belong on farms not flowers

04:24:54,520 --> 04:24:57,020
Right here

2668
04:24:57,020 --> 04:24:59,020
Well pizza oven will come in a later day

Definitely want one of these

2677
04:25:34,909 --> 04:25:39,309
But can't you just see going over somebody's house that has a pizza oven on their porch?

2678
04:25:39,950 --> 04:25:42,090

I definitely want one on my back porch, but I feel like somebody would think I was a dick

Can I have the kid's house be inside the house?

2685
04:26:21,899 --> 04:26:41,290
You open the door and you go into the kid's house. I guess I can have it in here

2686
04:26:41,370 --> 04:26:45,129
This could be like a little playroom. No, not I think everything's about the kids. I'm a dick

2687
04:26:45,690 --> 04:26:47,850
I have like three pizza ovens on my back porch

2688
04:26:48,489 --> 04:27:11,000
I would gladly be a dick if and then I have a pizza oven

2692
04:27:35,309 --> 04:27:37,309
county fair in the backyard

2693
04:27:37,469 --> 04:27:41,440
To charge people to come over

2694
04:27:44,420 --> 04:27:46,200
Recreation anything else?

2695
04:27:46,200 --> 04:27:53,879
Well now I know i'm a dick

2696
04:27:56,250 --> 04:27:59,360
Are you serious?

2697
04:27:59,360 --> 04:28:01,920
Who puts this outside? Why would you put this outside?

2698
04:28:10,889 --> 04:28:12,889
Well, I need to put the gravel down here

2699
04:28:16,729 --> 04:28:17,770

04:28:17,770 --> 04:28:25,639

04:28:39,159 --> 04:28:54,049
Hey what stop doing that every time I go in the house it takes it off

2702
04:29:24,000 --> 04:29:28,879
I don't want this tree here. That's the problem. There's a tree in the middle

2703
04:29:29,360 --> 04:29:40,829
Oh

2704
04:29:40,829 --> 04:29:42,829
No one puts gravel on their porch

2705
04:29:44,030 --> 04:29:46,030
I'm just trying to block it out to see

2706
04:29:47,680 --> 04:29:49,920
Well, how do oh fuck right? I don't I can do this

2707
04:29:50,719 --> 04:29:55,229

2708
04:29:55,229 --> 04:29:58,270
I didn't I didn't realize it. All right sports surface

2709
04:30:17,389 --> 04:30:27,180
Am I no, I actually have to place them one by one

2710
04:30:28,379 --> 04:30:30,299
No, I don't do I really?

2711
04:30:30,299 --> 04:30:35,469
Is there a bigger one?

2712
04:30:35,469 --> 04:30:37,309
Yeah, there is okay

2713
04:30:37,309 --> 04:30:39,739
I don't think I said that would be horrible

2714
04:30:39,819 --> 04:30:58,569
Okay, I gotta fix this. I'm

2715
04:31:14,190 --> 04:31:21,280
Oh crap god damn it. I need the logs. I need the long ones

2716
04:31:22,559 --> 04:31:31,520
How are you supposed to do this?

2717
04:31:35,260 --> 04:31:37,260
Or whatever I can it's fine

2718
04:31:38,219 --> 04:31:44,040
This is gonna be such pain in the ass

2719
04:31:50,059 --> 04:31:52,059
Just make a whole new house

2720
04:31:56,600 --> 04:31:58,600
No, I can't make an entirely new house

2721
04:32:07,319 --> 04:32:08,280
Dick

2722
04:32:08,280 --> 04:32:15,440
Does it really have to be a tree here that I can't remove?

2723
04:32:29,930 --> 04:32:31,770
I can chop the tree

2724
04:32:31,770 --> 04:32:33,290
How do I do that?

2725
04:32:33,290 --> 04:32:46,649
This house is giving me

2726
04:32:47,290 --> 04:32:48,889
With a weed whacker

2727
04:32:48,889 --> 04:32:52,090
All right. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Wait, this is just the whole thing is messing me up

2728
04:32:57,799 --> 04:33:00,600
I need walls. I need to paint this house

2729
04:33:01,559 --> 04:33:04,750
biscuit gravy

2730
04:33:04,750 --> 04:33:06,430
Okay

2731
04:33:06,430 --> 04:33:08,430
It the outside of the wall is gonna be biscuit

2732
04:33:09,229 --> 04:33:12,590
Let's see. Let's make I want to make sure I like it because this is it looks terrible

2733
04:33:13,389 --> 04:33:23,819
What's even worse? No, it's gonna be

2734
04:33:24,459 --> 04:33:38,669
all this stuff

2735
04:33:38,669 --> 04:33:40,439
walls

2736
04:33:40,439 --> 04:33:42,360
wall panels

2737
04:33:45,639 --> 04:33:47,610
wooden house

2738
04:33:47,610 --> 04:33:49,610
Brick i'm not doing brick

2739
04:33:51,689 --> 04:33:53,369

2740
04:33:53,369 --> 04:33:56,919
no

2741
04:33:56,919 --> 04:34:04,250
This one may be

2742
04:34:04,250 --> 04:34:06,250
smooth pastel pink

2743
04:34:07,819 --> 04:34:09,819
I'm not doing 3d tile

2744
04:34:13,770 --> 04:34:24,330
Ew, this is ew

2745
04:34:24,330 --> 04:34:28,889
Should I do the waves?

2746
04:34:28,889 --> 04:34:31,130
It's gonna I think it's probably gonna be there's a brick

2747
04:34:31,930 --> 04:34:34,299
Let's see how bad this looks

2748
04:34:34,299 --> 04:35:00,240
Let's just see how bad it looks. Hold on. That's not

2749
04:35:00,799 --> 04:35:06,599
Another hundred bucks

2750
04:35:06,599 --> 04:35:08,110
No good

2751
04:35:08,110 --> 04:35:09,950
No good

2752
04:35:09,950 --> 04:35:12,189
We'll do the light brick

2753
04:35:12,189 --> 04:35:13,630
uh

2754
04:35:13,630 --> 04:35:15,229
walrus boy

2755
04:35:15,229 --> 04:35:18,189
Gave a hundred dollars. Thanks for the 10,000 bits walrus boy

2756
04:35:20,939 --> 04:35:22,939
Thank you

2757
04:35:23,500 --> 04:35:26,619
That's a lot of fucking money

2758
04:35:27,639 --> 04:35:29,020
$100

2759
04:35:29,020 --> 04:35:33,180
And they say I was a sub for a while but had to cancel my deva card due to fraud charges

2760
04:35:33,900 --> 04:35:36,060
And so I was not able to resub again until now

2761
04:35:36,700 --> 04:35:39,979
Please take this and consider it back pay for all the times

2762
04:35:39,979 --> 04:35:43,419
I wanted to show my support by being subscribed if I wasn't able to

2763
04:35:44,380 --> 04:35:52,040
And for the literally years of laughs, you've given me. Thank you. I'm sorry to hear about the card problems, but thank you so much

2764
04:35:54,240 --> 04:35:57,599
Means a lot. I really appreciate that. That's a lot of money to ever give anybody

2765
04:36:00,000 --> 04:36:03,759
And I am shocked and floored that you'd want to give it to me

2766
04:36:04,400 --> 04:36:06,590
So, thank you

2767
04:36:06,590 --> 04:36:09,950
Uh, hopefully your card situation is done and looks good

2768
04:36:11,150 --> 04:36:18,860
Kind of like the outside of this house looks pretty good. But thank you

2769
04:36:22,110 --> 04:36:24,110
How do I panel up here?

2770
04:36:32,889 --> 04:36:39,549
um

2771
04:36:39,549 --> 04:36:45,520
How do I get that?

2772
04:36:45,520 --> 04:36:47,520
Nice. This is a nice

2773
04:36:47,680 --> 04:36:49,680
brick oven house

2774
04:36:51,360 --> 04:36:53,360
My house just is a pizza oven

2775
04:37:02,330 --> 04:37:04,490
It's fine. It's fine

2776
04:37:13,240 --> 04:37:15,240
Sooner or later, we'll have a good house

2777
04:37:23,360 --> 04:37:25,599
So earlier in the stream

2778
04:37:26,319 --> 04:37:28,750
You probably noticed I was

2779
04:37:28,750 --> 04:37:31,340
I was very high energy

2780
04:37:31,340 --> 04:37:34,060
I'm very low energy right now for the last like probably hour

2781
04:37:34,700 --> 04:37:36,810
I hit the wall

2782
04:37:36,810 --> 04:37:39,369
So if you don't know I didn't sleep very much last night

2783
04:37:40,009 --> 04:37:44,490
I only slept for about three hours. I was up at like seven o'clock in the morning

2784
04:37:45,439 --> 04:37:49,200
And I hit my second wind and turned the stream on it was like a psycho for three hours

2785
04:37:50,459 --> 04:37:53,180
And now i'm just like

2786
04:37:53,180 --> 04:38:08,560
Ah, I don't hate the outside here on the bright side. The internet has stabilized. Yeah, it's been pretty good

2787
04:38:10,279 --> 04:38:19,439
Take what we can get right

2788
04:38:19,439 --> 04:38:21,439
Go to bed. No, not yet

2789
04:38:21,439 --> 04:38:24,319
I think I can finish this house

2790
04:38:26,139 --> 04:38:27,900
All right question

2791
04:38:27,900 --> 04:38:32,060
Um, should I do the home alone house tomorrow? I ain't doing anything. I should maybe i'll do well

2792
04:38:32,060 --> 04:38:34,060
Like isn't there like a horror movie house

2793
04:38:34,139 --> 04:38:38,220
I feel like if we're gonna do house flipper I may as well dedicate like a couple of streams to it

2794
04:38:39,470 --> 04:38:41,150
That's right beep

2795
04:38:41,150 --> 04:38:48,459
Scream at me

2796
04:38:48,459 --> 04:38:51,720
This actually is just a pizza

2797
04:38:51,720 --> 04:38:54,520
I should just block this off and have these be three different pizza ovens

2798
04:38:57,049 --> 04:39:00,169
My house is just a giant pizza oven

2799
04:39:01,159 --> 04:39:14,380
And I live in it over here. That's just stupid enough for me to want to do it

2800
04:39:14,939 --> 04:39:23,549
I'm not making the pt house. I'll fucking throw up

2801
04:39:29,099 --> 04:39:30,299
Is there enough?

2802
04:39:30,299 --> 04:39:32,270
Is there two more?

2803
04:39:32,270 --> 04:39:47,229
Come on. Hey, look at that. Oh, are you shitting me right now guys?

2804
04:39:47,950 --> 04:39:50,669
Can I put like wood chips in here and have like a wood oven?

2805
04:39:51,709 --> 04:40:13,279
There's a wood stove

2806
04:40:13,279 --> 04:40:16,409
Oh, come on. I can't

2807
04:40:16,729 --> 04:40:20,009
Just make yeah, I can make like a like a pizza parlor. That's a good idea

2808
04:40:20,810 --> 04:40:25,080
So what can I do for this?

2809
04:40:25,080 --> 04:40:27,080
Personally close this up. I need three

2810
04:40:31,159 --> 04:40:42,000
I don't have enough. Can I seriously not build more one at a time? I thought I could

2811
04:40:43,279 --> 04:40:45,639
Isn't it q or something?

2812
04:40:45,720 --> 04:40:49,740
We're like w e r where what is it t q?

2813
04:40:55,630 --> 04:40:58,680
No, there we go. I thought I already did this

2814
04:41:01,479 --> 04:41:06,919
There we go. There. Okay. There it is

2815
04:41:07,799 --> 04:41:19,259
All right. This one's gonna be coal

2816
04:41:20,220 --> 04:41:22,220
For like extra crispy pizzas

2817
04:41:22,939 --> 04:41:27,549
This would give me wood fire coal fire

2818
04:41:28,110 --> 04:41:29,470
and then

2819
04:41:29,470 --> 04:41:30,430
um

2820
04:41:30,430 --> 04:41:32,349
I don't know microwave

2821
04:41:32,349 --> 04:41:37,319
How else does half of the restaurants make their pizzas and is the parlor the garden doesn't even matter

2822
04:41:37,959 --> 04:41:40,919
This is like the okay. Uh, this is the way you come in

2823
04:41:41,880 --> 04:41:45,560
Brick oven

2824
04:41:45,560 --> 04:41:51,159
Yeah, the whole thing's a pizza oven and then the coal look I can do coal and let's just block this out in my brain here

2825
04:41:54,270 --> 04:41:58,110
Yeah, you just like fucking frisbee the pizza into there. You can have like 10 of them at a time

2826
04:41:59,069 --> 04:42:04,720
Let's see. All right. We got ceramic charcoal

2827
04:42:08,119 --> 04:42:14,090
This could be charcoal

2828
04:42:14,090 --> 04:42:16,090
Need shelves and racks for the pizza

2829
04:42:17,259 --> 04:42:24,639
Yeah

2830
04:42:24,639 --> 04:42:27,529
ceramic

2831
04:42:27,529 --> 04:42:37,520
This looks like charcoal. It's got to be just like

2832
04:42:38,680 --> 04:42:40,680
Brown black or something

2833
04:42:41,000 --> 04:42:43,849
That looks all right

2834
04:42:43,849 --> 04:42:53,500
Let's try this

2835
04:42:54,139 --> 04:43:10,700
That looks terrible

2836
04:43:10,700 --> 04:43:12,700
This is shit

2837
04:43:12,700 --> 04:43:14,700
This is a shit idea

2838
04:43:14,860 --> 04:43:38,380
Okay the back floor

2839
04:43:41,639 --> 04:43:43,720
This looks like wood wood fire

2840
04:43:44,040 --> 04:43:48,880
Fire

2841
04:43:48,880 --> 04:44:05,150
Rug a rug fired oven. Okay, looks good

2842
04:44:05,950 --> 04:44:16,000
and then this needs to be like

2843
04:44:16,560 --> 04:44:25,020
black

2844
04:44:25,020 --> 04:44:26,380
Just need

2845
04:44:26,380 --> 04:44:28,380
Not blue

2846
04:44:28,779 --> 04:44:31,470
It just needs to be black

2847
04:44:31,790 --> 04:44:33,790
They don't black carpets

2848
04:44:39,900 --> 04:44:47,319
A pizza rug

2849
04:44:47,400 --> 04:44:49,400
Yeah, but that's for the main hallway

2850
04:44:49,720 --> 04:44:51,720
Can I just paint the ground black?

2851
04:44:52,520 --> 04:44:54,520
Imagine that

2852
04:44:55,159 --> 04:45:07,180
Imagine painting your ground black doing some weird shit in there. I don't think I can paint the ground

2853
04:45:11,740 --> 04:45:30,490
I mean they could do the charcoal to be the sides

2854
04:45:40,159 --> 04:45:43,040
The apartment has black floors. That's interesting

2855
04:45:44,479 --> 04:45:53,369
I mean, I guess maybe like entryways

2856
04:45:53,770 --> 04:45:59,069
Oh, that's fine. We need like heat lamps, too

2857
04:46:01,720 --> 04:46:03,479
I'm gonna air it out

2858
04:46:03,479 --> 04:46:12,750
All right. So let me see

2859
04:46:12,750 --> 04:46:14,750
So the wooden paneling is to go in here

2860
04:46:18,729 --> 04:46:20,729
Maybe we can get actual wood paneling

2861
04:46:25,689 --> 04:46:28,599
wall panels

2862
04:46:28,599 --> 04:46:29,639
Wood

2863
04:46:29,639 --> 04:46:31,639
Here we go. Yeah, that's perfect

2864
04:46:32,360 --> 04:46:35,049
Is the same thing? No

2865
04:46:36,409 --> 04:46:46,139
Do they even have pizzas?

2866
04:46:48,040 --> 04:47:10,700
I wish I could do this faster. It's a pizza hut taco bell combo

2867
04:47:13,209 --> 04:47:16,110
Why did you say that?

2868
04:47:16,110 --> 04:47:18,110
You just said the magic

2869
04:47:19,340 --> 04:47:21,340
like 14 words

2870
04:47:22,169 --> 04:47:25,610
Pizza hut and taco bell combo 9. Fuck

2871
04:47:28,330 --> 04:47:32,810
Wait pizza hut and taco bell combo. Those are syllables. Those aren't words

2872
04:47:33,849 --> 04:47:35,849
You could tell i'm fucking tired

2873
04:47:40,779 --> 04:47:42,669
Fucking tired

2874
04:47:42,669 --> 04:47:44,830
I counted syllables as if they were words

2875
04:47:45,470 --> 04:47:47,080
but you said

2876
04:47:47,080 --> 04:47:49,080
You said pizza hut and taco bell

2877
04:47:56,169 --> 04:47:58,889
You said the combination of things that make me hungry

2878
04:48:06,459 --> 04:48:09,259
I've entered sleeping mode. Yeah, I have um, I am

2879
04:48:10,540 --> 04:48:12,639
I might have to call it soon. Unfortunately

2880
04:48:13,520 --> 04:48:15,840
I'm just glad I was able to stream for at least a while

2881
04:48:17,569 --> 04:48:20,610
And this is relaxing and fun. This is like helping me go to bed

2882
04:48:21,569 --> 04:48:30,720
How do people do 24-hour streams? I can barely stay awake for 24 hours

2883
04:48:44,419 --> 04:48:47,700
Wooden box room. What am I doing?

2884
04:48:48,659 --> 04:48:53,619
What am I making a pizza house? What is it? What are we doing? What are we doing right now?

2885
04:48:55,040 --> 04:48:57,200
Making three giant pizza ovens

2886
04:49:00,259 --> 04:49:01,540
Why?

2887
04:49:01,540 --> 04:49:06,029
Why am I doing this?

2888
04:49:06,029 --> 04:49:08,349
I feel like if I walked in this room, it'd be like

2889
04:49:12,779 --> 04:49:15,819
I want to is it weird that I want to sprint around in a circle in this room

2890
04:49:16,750 --> 04:49:19,709
I want to fucking run around. I know this is basketball court now

2891
04:49:20,430 --> 04:49:29,939
I want to just fuck it looks like so waxed and slippery and shiny

2892
04:49:29,939 --> 04:49:34,500
I want to just start here and sprint and stop and turn and sprint so it goes

2893
04:49:38,080 --> 04:49:40,080
That's so badly want to do that

2894
04:49:40,080 --> 04:49:50,419
Whatever gets you off. Well, yeah, that's fine

2895
04:49:51,220 --> 04:49:57,099
Have you guys ever seen like a freshly waxed basketball court?

2896
04:49:58,669 --> 04:50:00,669
Oh, it's something to behold

2897
04:50:00,750 --> 04:50:02,750
it's just like when the uh

2898
04:50:02,750 --> 04:50:05,709
So when the when the when the gazebo goes over the ice

2899
04:50:07,709 --> 04:50:12,189
And it's brand new ice freshly shaved down freshly like coated

2900
04:50:16,189 --> 04:50:18,189
The zip. Yeah, the zamboni, whatever

2901
04:50:22,110 --> 04:50:27,310
I always want every time anytime that the the I can't say zamboni. That's a gazebo

2902
04:50:31,740 --> 04:50:34,299
So anytime the zamboni goes across

2903
04:50:35,419 --> 04:50:37,659
Same scenario. I want to get a running start

2904
04:50:38,750 --> 04:50:40,750
like wet slippery just

2905
04:50:41,369 --> 04:50:42,990
zambonied ice

2906
04:50:42,990 --> 04:50:48,689
Start outside the rink and run as fast as I okay. So let's say that's the rink starts right there, right?

2907
04:50:49,490 --> 04:50:55,250
I want to run as fast as I humanly possibly can jump dive face first slide across the whole rink

2908
04:50:55,650 --> 04:51:13,939
Did you just make like a golden knights dis?

2909
04:51:19,380 --> 04:51:25,490
Why the golden knights did a fantastic fucking job

2910
04:51:26,290 --> 04:51:37,069
I feel like I could play like goalie for a minute. I think I could like stop a slap shot. I really do

2911
04:51:38,029 --> 04:51:41,619
If I ever got like the balls

2912
04:51:43,099 --> 04:51:45,099
imagine if I like contacted

2913
04:51:45,340 --> 04:51:48,689
Like the glow like the golden knights organization

2914
04:51:49,389 --> 04:51:52,590
And I just had a star player like try to score a goal on me

2915
04:51:53,150 --> 04:52:01,020
I feel like I feel like I might die

2916
04:52:01,259 --> 04:52:07,439
I don't know why i'm picturing this weird like adam sandler movie scenario

2917
04:52:08,159 --> 04:52:12,979
Well, like I get the puck right in the visor right in the between the eyes

2918
04:52:23,439 --> 04:52:25,439
I'm not doing all those up there

2919
04:52:26,369 --> 04:52:27,569
I can't

2920
04:52:27,569 --> 04:52:32,180
That's so small

2921
04:52:32,259 --> 04:52:38,270
Do them do them do them. All right. All right. All right. I'm doing i'm doing i'm doing i'm doing them. I'm doing them

2922
04:52:39,069 --> 04:52:53,779
Finish painting the other room. I will don't worry. I will

2923
04:52:54,500 --> 04:53:02,099
Don't worry. I'm gonna come back tomorrow. I'm gonna be rested. We're gonna have a static ip

2924
04:53:02,740 --> 04:53:04,740
And there's gonna be no drop frames

2925
04:53:05,139 --> 04:53:08,580
And what are the like fucking wizard of oz bullshit made up scenarios?

2926
04:53:08,580 --> 04:53:10,580
Am I gonna come up with here that i'm not gonna be real?

2927
04:53:11,060 --> 04:53:12,340
I wonder

2928
04:53:21,229 --> 04:53:22,909
I can't paint all the ceiling

2929
04:53:22,909 --> 04:53:25,150
I'm gonna leave that there. No, i'm not I can't handle that

2930
04:53:32,909 --> 04:53:34,369
Karate

2931
04:53:34,369 --> 04:53:40,000
Get that looks good

2932
04:53:40,560 --> 04:53:43,840
That's a nice wooden room. Ah, fuck. No, it's not done

2933
04:53:51,169 --> 04:53:55,490
This room is just bizarrely weird. I just feel like I need to I feel like I come in here

2934
04:53:55,970 --> 04:53:58,930
And like sit in the corner and need to be quiet in here

2935
04:54:01,569 --> 04:54:03,970
Uh, this is like a weird. I don't know why this reminds me

2936
04:54:04,450 --> 04:54:08,529
I don't know. I feel like I need to be like quiet in this room and i'm being like punished

2937
04:54:12,900 --> 04:54:22,270
It's like the wooden room. You just have to go in here and be quiet in there. There's a window though. So

2938
04:54:22,909 --> 04:54:47,229
rats

2939
04:54:47,470 --> 04:54:49,549
Grass coming up

2940
04:54:49,549 --> 04:54:51,069
in

2941
04:54:51,069 --> 04:54:56,619
My damn it. I can't make the ceiling wood

2942
04:54:59,979 --> 04:55:03,020
I can't make the ceiling wood. It doesn't work

2943
04:55:03,819 --> 04:55:06,020
Okay. What was this one gonna be?

2944
04:55:06,020 --> 04:55:09,500
charcoal

2945
04:55:09,500 --> 04:55:15,490
Go to sleep. I'm good. I'm good. Don't worry. I'm gonna wrap it up here in a few minutes

2946
04:55:15,810 --> 04:55:18,430
I'm going for about five hours

2947
04:55:18,430 --> 04:55:20,290
I'm very tired

2948
04:55:20,290 --> 04:55:26,500
But I had a lot of fun. It's fun to come back. Why did I just what the fuck am I doing?

2949
04:55:35,939 --> 04:55:37,939
I'm typing in from reddit

2950
04:55:45,439 --> 04:55:46,799
It's like

2951
04:55:46,799 --> 04:55:50,799
Our reddit. Why is my this is my browser

2952
04:55:55,340 --> 04:56:00,860
I got what what? Oh, wow. That'd be great if I had this much fucking money in like firefox

2953
04:56:06,290 --> 04:56:08,529
All right, i'm going that's it. That's not it's time

2954
04:56:13,119 --> 04:56:15,119
That's so fucking ridiculous

2955
04:56:15,439 --> 04:56:17,439
I'm really not even that tired

2956
04:56:18,380 --> 04:56:20,380
Yeah, it's time. That's time to call it

2957
04:56:24,099 --> 04:56:26,180

2959
04:56:34,060 --> 04:56:42,779
Let me see this clip. What a joke. I'm going for about five hours. I'm very tired

2960
04:56:44,299 --> 04:56:46,590
Wrapper

2961
04:56:46,590 --> 04:56:47,790
Wrapper

2962
04:56:47,790 --> 04:56:51,229
W-r-a-p-p-e-r is what I first typed for about five hours

2963
04:56:52,130 --> 04:56:53,490
I'm very tired

2964
04:56:53,490 --> 04:56:55,169
Wrapper

2965
04:56:55,169 --> 04:56:57,169
What do you mean? What do you mean wrapper?

2966
04:57:00,290 --> 04:57:06,220
What?

2967
04:57:07,099 --> 04:57:09,099
Wrapper and then uh

2968
04:57:15,040 --> 04:57:17,200
Oh, I was talking about wrapping it up

2969
04:57:18,990 --> 04:57:20,990
All right. Good. I i'm getting out of here

2970
04:57:26,540 --> 04:57:31,650
oh

2971
04:57:31,650 --> 04:57:37,729
That's so like embarrassing but whatever I feel like i'm like anesthesia and i'm waking up and saying weird stuff

2972
04:57:39,090 --> 04:57:42,369
You guys like recording me on your phone. You're gonna post me to fucking facebook

2973
04:57:45,810 --> 04:57:47,860
uh

2974
04:57:47,860 --> 04:57:53,540
Anywho, yeah, that's five hours. I haven't had didn't have much sleep. I'm just glad I was able to stream

2975
04:57:54,400 --> 04:57:56,400
20,000 dropped frames in five hours

2976
04:57:57,439 --> 04:57:59,439
We were stable for a while though

2977
04:58:04,959 --> 04:58:08,459
Thank you again everybody for putting up with this

2978
04:58:10,130 --> 04:58:12,930
Uh, it can be very frustrating. It's very frustrating for me

2979
04:58:14,159 --> 04:58:16,479
But it's something that i'm actively trying to fix

2980
04:58:17,520 --> 04:58:19,520
Hopefully it's not too much of a

2981
04:58:19,860 --> 04:58:22,209
Pain in the ass for you to watch

2982
04:58:22,209 --> 04:58:24,209
But I do appreciate it and I really do

2983
04:58:30,740 --> 04:58:32,540
Much love to you

2985
04:58:35,900 --> 04:58:37,979
Uh bits or anything because so we can do that would be fine

2986
04:58:39,740 --> 04:58:41,740
We'll do some more house flipper tomorrow

2987
04:58:45,020 --> 04:58:52,380
Starting at the normal time. Hopefully we have a good string of like five hours of stability six seven hours, maybe we'll see

2988
04:58:55,709 --> 04:58:58,189
and then let's take a look at the calendar like just

2989
04:58:59,599 --> 04:59:01,439
If I can even stream

2990
04:59:01,439 --> 04:59:03,439
I hate that I have to do this again, but

04:59:04,159 --> 04:59:06,479
Uh, so today's thursday friday. We'll do house flipper

You should move to canada and come have a good hockey team and good internet

3023
05:01:18,180 --> 05:01:22,419
Oh, and it'll suit you really well since most of our pizza places have walk-in ovens

3024
05:01:24,900 --> 05:01:29,459
I'm really tired. Have I just been talking about pizza since the beginning of the stream?

3025
05:01:30,180 --> 05:01:37,979
Was I I don't even remember

3026
05:01:39,419 --> 05:01:41,979
Okay

3027
05:01:41,979 --> 05:01:43,979
Am I weird am I being weird?

3028
05:01:44,139 --> 05:01:47,330
Am I am I a weirdo?

3029
05:01:47,330 --> 05:01:49,330
If you have to ask that question

3030
05:01:49,819 --> 05:01:51,819
You probably already have the answer

3031
05:01:52,060 --> 05:01:59,599
Uh, thanks for the three dollars though

3032
05:01:59,599 --> 05:02:01,360
Uh, thank you am

3033
05:02:01,360 --> 05:02:03,360
ambix for the 250

3034
05:02:03,360 --> 05:02:06,740
This is a whole thing in german. I think

3035
05:02:07,540 --> 05:02:10,849
hello my

3036
05:02:10,849 --> 05:02:12,380

This were episode. Oh, it's okay. Okay. I see what's going on

05:02:23,709 --> 05:02:29,709
It's just the first minute of again

05:02:30,529 --> 05:02:33,490
Thank you for the uh german translated germa craft

3042
05:02:37,939 --> 05:02:42,259
Thank you for the 250 as well freudian weapon. Thanks for 250. He lives

3043
05:02:43,220 --> 05:02:49,650
I didn't think you'd be streaming tonight. Thanks for the surprise neither did I but thankfully we could get something in

3044
05:02:50,290 --> 05:02:52,290
And have some fun because I had fun

3045
05:02:52,610 --> 05:02:55,580
It was fun learning how to cut grass with a weed whacker

3046
05:02:56,060 --> 05:03:00,159
Talked a little bit of shit had a little bit of fun

3047
05:03:00,400 --> 05:03:03,619
Hopefully you enjoyed it. Thank you for the 250

3048
05:03:05,459 --> 05:03:11,869
Uh, thank you halo soft boy for the 260. I don't think that's a straw man. I think that's a real man

3049
05:03:12,990 --> 05:03:15,709
Something I said earlier and then they're laughing about it

3050
05:03:20,380 --> 05:03:22,619
rapper

3051
05:03:22,619 --> 05:03:25,180
Reddit. Oh my god

3052
05:03:25,240 --> 05:03:34,689
Autopilot man just on autopilot dr fudge. Thanks for the 15 dollars

3053
05:03:36,610 --> 05:03:44,540
Germa, I can't hear the hammer turn it up. I did at some point there. I really actually did

3054
05:03:46,720 --> 05:03:52,639
Am I ever gonna get new brb end stream overlays? Yes, blordow is currently working on them right now

3055
05:03:54,990 --> 05:03:56,750
in a week or two

3056
05:03:56,750 --> 05:04:02,099
Depending on how long it takes them to make it. We're going to have 10 to 12 new songs

3057
05:04:02,740 --> 05:04:04,099
for background

3058
05:04:04,099 --> 05:04:07,779
When we do the wind down and a wind down animated screen

3059
05:04:09,860 --> 05:04:14,209
Something to play in the background. That's not the stream over so there'll be

3060
05:04:14,930 --> 05:04:17,889
A large playlist of songs that he has created

3061
05:04:19,740 --> 05:04:25,569
For the wind down specifically so there'll be two portions of the end of the stream this one

3062
05:04:26,380 --> 05:04:28,380
Which will not have this stream over

3063
05:04:28,860 --> 05:04:32,450
It'll be more thought out, you know

3064
05:04:34,299 --> 05:04:37,340
And then we'll transition to this one when it's actually time to leave

3065
05:04:39,409 --> 05:04:41,970
We have some ideas. He's got a couple of great ideas for

3066
05:04:43,220 --> 05:04:46,419
Stuff that happens in the background and the scene and we've been talking back and forth

3067
05:04:47,380 --> 05:04:58,299
It's probably going to be pretty great. Don't get rid of the screen songs. You no, no, no

3068
05:04:58,380 --> 05:05:00,380
That's going to be added to a circulation

3069
05:05:02,509 --> 05:05:05,310
so the intro and outro songs will stay the same but

3070
05:05:06,349 --> 05:05:09,630
If I want to I can pump in one of the new ones in random places

3071
05:05:09,709 --> 05:05:12,669
I can have two or three lined up. I can change it once in a while

3072
05:05:14,369 --> 05:05:16,369
It's just adding not subtracting. So don't worry

3073
05:05:22,020 --> 05:05:25,180
So don't worry. It should be fun. Blordow makes

3074
05:05:25,740 --> 05:05:28,220
amazing music

3075
05:05:28,220 --> 05:05:31,180
He's one of the best when it comes to making

3076
05:05:32,220 --> 05:05:33,979
He makes like really great

3077
05:05:33,979 --> 05:05:35,479
just chill

3078
05:05:35,479 --> 05:05:36,540
relaxing

3079
05:05:36,540 --> 05:05:37,340
music

3080
05:05:37,340 --> 05:05:39,500
He's got great talent when it comes to making

3081
05:05:40,770 --> 05:05:43,810
Like listen to this just listen. This is just like a this is just beautiful

3082
05:05:44,369 --> 05:05:47,759
He's got great ambient talent

3083
05:05:47,840 --> 05:05:55,840
So there'll be uh, essentially what we talked about is I was like I want a lot more of this

3084
05:05:56,799 --> 05:05:58,209
so

3085
05:05:58,209 --> 05:06:00,770
We're gonna get more of these low-key ambient tracks

3086
05:06:01,490 --> 05:06:03,490
That he is very much known for so

3087
05:06:13,340 --> 05:06:16,220
But thank you to dr fudge for the 15 dollars. Really appreciate that

3088
05:06:19,419 --> 05:06:22,619
Thank you. Uh three dollars from Leroy. Thank you Leroy

3089
05:06:23,259 --> 05:06:26,959
Hey germa, good luck with the colonoscopy. I'm 26 and had to have one of those last year

3090
05:06:27,520 --> 05:06:29,520
For my ongoing stomach problems

3091
05:06:29,520 --> 05:06:32,319
I really appreciate that you talk openly and without shame

3092
05:06:32,880 --> 05:06:36,159
About this kind of stuff makes me feel like less of a weird gross goblin

3093
05:06:37,040 --> 05:06:41,759
Anyway, I wish you the best. Hope you get a chance to check out some fire sign theater stuff in the future

3094
05:06:43,979 --> 05:06:45,360
yeah, i've

3095
05:06:45,360 --> 05:06:47,759
i've been a pretty much an open book when it comes to

3096
05:06:48,619 --> 05:06:50,000
illnesses and stuff

3097
05:06:50,000 --> 05:06:53,950
I feel like it's

3098
05:06:53,950 --> 05:06:55,470
it's just

3099
05:06:55,470 --> 05:07:02,110
I have this shit. I have this problem. I have these things that I have to do. I've had it for pretty much over a decade now

3100
05:07:02,750 --> 05:07:05,229
So it's like what I like to pretend it doesn't exist

3101
05:07:08,340 --> 05:07:10,720
I just want to make sure

3102
05:07:10,720 --> 05:07:12,720
That everything is good

3103
05:07:13,229 --> 05:07:15,229
Because I have not been

3104
05:07:15,709 --> 05:07:18,319
really evaluated

3105
05:07:18,319 --> 05:07:19,900
since like

3106
05:07:19,900 --> 05:07:21,900
2014 2013

3107
05:07:22,639 --> 05:07:26,159
Maybe a little bit later. Maybe 2015 to the point when I have my last real

3108
05:07:26,799 --> 05:07:28,799
Evaluation at a sigmoid

3109
05:07:28,799 --> 05:07:32,240
Oscopy, which is not the same as a colonoscopy. It's the same thing

3110
05:07:32,880 --> 05:07:37,520
But they don't go as far into your intestinal tract. They just kind of go up

3111
05:07:38,590 --> 05:07:43,840
Into like the lower half of your colon. They don't go all the way in so yes

3112
05:07:44,319 --> 05:07:47,439
You can say they need to go deeper. They do. Yes, they do

3113
05:07:49,700 --> 05:07:53,700
And i'm i'm doing i've had kind of some issues recently over the last six months

3114
05:07:54,590 --> 05:07:57,389
I don't know if they're related to the colitis and all these other

3115
05:07:57,950 --> 05:08:02,740
IBD issues, but I don't know. I just I it was a good idea

3116
05:08:02,900 --> 05:08:06,900
He said let's just do it just do the whole thing and let's be certain certain, right?

3117
05:08:08,319 --> 05:08:17,389
So, oh that that's happening next week. The prep is the worst. Yeah, that's why i'm gonna have to take

3118
05:08:18,029 --> 05:08:21,900
I'm probably gonna have to take like two or three days off

3119
05:08:22,540 --> 05:08:24,560
Because you can't eat

3120
05:08:24,560 --> 05:08:28,000
A full 24 hours before the procedure you cannot eat food

3121
05:08:28,479 --> 05:08:30,750
So I won't really be

3122
05:08:30,750 --> 05:08:34,029
I won't have any energy. I'll be tired. I'll be kind of irritable probably

3123
05:08:35,279 --> 05:08:40,959
So I don't think I can stream a day before the day of and maybe even the day after depending on how the drugs

3124
05:08:42,000 --> 05:08:50,000
Um, I did say I wasn't gonna do any drugs going straight up. No sedation, but depending on the practice

3125
05:08:51,250 --> 05:08:54,209
You actually might from my understanding is they might not offer that

3126
05:08:56,740 --> 05:09:01,139
I just don't like the idea of going under. I really don't if it's it freaks me out

3127
05:09:01,700 --> 05:09:06,830
You should be okay the day after

3128
05:09:06,830 --> 05:09:08,110
Yeah, we'll see

3129
05:09:08,110 --> 05:09:12,110
I'm definitely gonna do at least the day before and the day of obviously I won't be able to do anything the day of

3130
05:09:14,130 --> 05:09:16,209
but

3131
05:09:16,209 --> 05:09:19,900
Anesthesia just freaks me out. I've had it done once

3132
05:09:21,630 --> 05:09:25,549
I just don't like it. I just don't like the idea. I don't like the whole process

3133
05:09:28,270 --> 05:09:32,430
So I already talked to them. I said I either don't want sedation or I want it

3134
05:09:34,270 --> 05:09:37,729
Light enough where like very light so

3135
05:09:38,450 --> 05:09:40,610
Hopefully I can you know, they actually adhere to that

3136
05:09:51,729 --> 05:09:54,849
Yeah, yeah, you know, it's it's a it's a conscious sedation, right?

3137
05:09:58,700 --> 05:10:01,020
I've had tons of operations and I just enjoy it now

3138
05:10:01,979 --> 05:10:05,020
Yeah, it's I guess something you just kind of will would get used to

3139
05:10:13,439 --> 05:10:15,439
but I I think i'm just kind of

3140
05:10:15,759 --> 05:10:19,040
Weirdo and I always like to have this weird scenario in my brain

3141
05:10:19,680 --> 05:10:22,799
Where it's like

3142
05:10:22,799 --> 05:10:24,799
Okay, like here we go

3143
05:10:25,380 --> 05:10:28,659
All right. It's time for you to go under. All right, here it comes

3144
05:10:28,740 --> 05:10:30,979
Oh here you're gonna feel a little a little pinch in your arm

3145
05:10:31,540 --> 05:10:37,299
Okay, and now you're going down. Here we go. All right. We'll see you soon. Have a nice sleep

3146
05:10:40,130 --> 05:10:44,369
There's a fire in the building fire and i'm just like there's a fire

3147
05:10:45,330 --> 05:10:47,330
I can't do anything

3148
05:10:48,639 --> 05:10:50,639
uh, you know what I mean like

3149
05:10:53,340 --> 05:10:55,340
Like if fire alarm goes off and you're just like

3150
05:10:59,299 --> 05:11:03,569
Was somebody gonna pick you up

3151
05:11:04,049 --> 05:11:08,290
You shouldn't overthink things like that. I know but you don't have like

3152
05:11:11,090 --> 05:11:16,770
It's the same person that told you that i'm scared of like them finding dna on my bubblegum

3153
05:11:17,490 --> 05:11:29,380
Oh, he would maybe some of you guys weren't here earlier

3154
05:11:29,779 --> 05:11:40,319
The doctor screamed in my face one time right before I went under what the fuck

3155
05:11:45,840 --> 05:11:51,360
What no, that's so bad. That's not really did that really happen?

3156
05:11:56,299 --> 05:11:58,939
The last time I was under conscious sedation. I was

3157
05:11:59,900 --> 05:12:01,659
I got my wisdom teeth up

3158
05:12:01,659 --> 05:12:05,470
And it was really fucked up

3159
05:12:05,470 --> 05:12:07,470
It was fucking weird, man

3160
05:12:08,590 --> 05:12:10,509
I was lying in the chair and I remember just like

3161
05:12:11,229 --> 05:12:13,229
Hearing the same sound

3162
05:12:13,229 --> 05:12:18,990
Go and don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't he was playing music on a radio and it was just

3163
05:12:19,310 --> 05:12:22,270
I could hear a loop of the last thing that was said it was just like

3164
05:12:23,150 --> 05:12:25,549
And it ended and then we we we we we we we did

3165
05:12:27,630 --> 05:12:29,630
It was just that I could hear it over and over again

3166
05:12:29,950 --> 05:12:32,130
And then I said out loud

3167
05:12:32,450 --> 05:12:37,009
Do people say funny things on this and the dentist said stop talking

3168
05:12:37,729 --> 05:12:39,810
And then I started laughing and then I that's all I remember

3169
05:12:40,290 --> 05:12:52,349
I had my wisdom teeth. Yeah

3170
05:12:52,349 --> 05:12:54,349
I hate that. I hate it

3171
05:12:56,189 --> 05:12:58,189
I know some people are really into the whole

3172
05:12:59,310 --> 05:13:04,349
Oh, man. Yeah, you get a psychedelic man. Like the walls are breathing

3173
05:13:05,069 --> 05:13:10,830
No, no, no, no, I want the walls to stay firm and and not collapse and I want them to not breathe at all

3174
05:13:14,900 --> 05:13:19,139
I love just sinking down like when I love that. No, no, no, no, no, no, no

3175
05:13:20,099 --> 05:13:29,860
Are we getting kicked off? No, we're good. The walls got him

3176
05:13:33,220 --> 05:13:36,819
I'm very I like I need to be very very close to reality

3177
05:13:38,049 --> 05:13:40,529
Otherwise, I feel like i've just I would lose my mind

3178
05:13:41,250 --> 05:13:53,250
There's a difference between a hallucinogenics and sedation. I know I know i'm but i'm just saying

3179
05:13:54,290 --> 05:13:56,909
I don't I would probably hate it

3180
05:13:56,990 --> 05:13:59,069
Just because when I get put on a drug

3181
05:14:02,419 --> 05:14:07,779
I I like don't want to be on it. So i'm sitting there while I hear like the same sound play 10 times

3182
05:14:08,500 --> 05:14:13,060
and like the walls start to move around and I start to put my head back and i'm just like

3183
05:14:16,689 --> 05:14:20,049
I I want to go out of here. I want to go home

3184
05:14:20,930 --> 05:14:23,729
That's why i'm like, I don't want sedation and they're like you're fucking stupid

3185
05:14:34,020 --> 05:14:46,349
But we'll see don't play yourself like that sedation isn't a bad thing. No, I know I know

3186
05:14:51,740 --> 05:14:53,740
Just get sedated to deal with the sedation

3187
05:14:54,299 --> 05:15:01,790
I'm not nervous about going under but i'm nervous about the idea of being in that loopy state

3188
05:15:02,029 --> 05:15:06,189
All the videos out there are people getting their wisdom teeth removed and worry what I might say

3189
05:15:07,150 --> 05:15:16,020
Yeah, I don't know man like I might wake up and start saying passwords, you know, like I don't fucking know

3190
05:15:16,659 --> 05:15:25,419
I would be the worst person to be on a truth serum. I would just say I would just tell you everything

3191
05:15:25,819 --> 05:15:39,139
You'll just save reddit

3192
05:15:44,000 --> 05:15:45,759
Reddit

3193
05:15:45,759 --> 05:15:47,860
Reddit I want to go to reddit

3194
05:15:53,419 --> 05:15:56,299
And I feel like if you sit around and you here's the thing

3195
05:15:57,099 --> 05:16:00,700
If i'm sitting there and i'm on those drugs and i'm going to tell myself over and over again

3196
05:16:00,939 --> 05:16:05,659
Don't say anything. Don't say anything fucking stupid. Don't say anything crazy. Just be normal. You can do it

3197
05:16:05,740 --> 05:16:09,099
You could do this. You can be normal. I feel like the outside perspective is like

3198
05:16:10,479 --> 05:16:15,700
I'm not saying anything normal and i'm being insane. I'm not going to start streaming

3199
05:16:16,259 --> 05:16:18,759
No, i'm going to be under close supervision

3200
05:16:30,209 --> 05:16:32,209
Nope, no cameras are allowed

3201
05:16:32,610 --> 05:16:34,610
I ain't having anybody fill me

3202
05:16:36,590 --> 05:16:38,189
After i'm coming up

3203
05:16:38,189 --> 05:16:43,009
Mm-hmm. I i'm not gonna happen. They're gonna get all my passwords

3204
05:16:51,700 --> 05:16:59,409
That would be gold

3205
05:16:59,409 --> 05:17:04,639
record

3206
05:17:04,639 --> 05:17:06,400
But let's keep going

3207
05:17:06,400 --> 05:17:08,000

05:17:08,000 --> 05:17:10,000

05:17:19,619 --> 05:17:23,419
Germa flips houses on stream germa old

3212
05:17:24,139 --> 05:17:27,659
Flipping houses is kind of like a boomer activity, isn't it?

3213
05:17:28,459 --> 05:17:31,099
No, there are some like millennials and zoomers that are into that

3214
05:17:31,819 --> 05:17:35,569
They're just not doing it on tv on four different networks

3215
05:17:41,119 --> 05:17:43,279
Thank you zach the sloth for the five dollars

3216
05:17:44,000 --> 05:17:48,029
Hey germa, i'm sitting outside watching you stream and enjoying the warm weather

3217
05:17:48,509 --> 05:17:50,590
When you first made that loud sound with the hammer

3218
05:17:50,590 --> 05:17:56,430
I shit my pants and shouted by phone on the pavement, but don't worry. It wasn't your stream's fault. It was my

3219
05:17:57,069 --> 05:17:59,069
ass fault

3220
05:18:00,939 --> 05:18:07,180

If you peel those off does paint come with it?

So, thank you and especially thank you the 10 dollars

3285
05:24:39,040 --> 05:24:44,500
Really appreciate that. They never said they watched for that long. What?

3286
05:24:46,299 --> 05:24:48,700
They said thank you for nearly a decade of content

3287
05:24:49,340 --> 05:24:52,990
What do you mean? They didn't tell me how long

3288
05:24:52,990 --> 05:24:55,919
They said a decade that's 10 years

3289
05:25:01,580 --> 05:25:03,979
Thank you the yellowest for the three dollars and 50 cents. Hey, hey

Silver flame. Thanks for the 250. Hey germo surveys gave me bits again. Anyways, I met a girl and we hit it off

3296
05:25:26,900 --> 05:25:28,900
Our conversation went to streamers

3297
05:25:29,619 --> 05:25:36,340
She made a comment about lady streamers. I mentioned how you sometimes don't wear clothes and stream in a bathrobe

3298
05:25:37,630 --> 05:25:41,549
Anyway, moral of the story is that she was actually interested in me rambling about you, which is cool

3299
05:25:42,029 --> 05:25:45,709
I think she's a keeper. Well, that's all smooches. Enjoy the money. You silly willy

3300
05:25:47,740 --> 05:25:49,869
well

3301
05:25:49,869 --> 05:25:52,990
What you told her about me is factually correct statements

3302
05:25:54,909 --> 05:25:56,590
I do stream

3303
05:25:56,590 --> 05:26:01,060
Without clothes on I don't have a camera on but I do sit here

3304
05:26:02,659 --> 05:26:06,819
As just me as the day I was born. No, I don't that's a lie

3305
05:26:07,380 --> 05:26:10,099
I don't sit here naked. How would I do that?

3306
05:26:10,659 --> 05:26:12,659
There's other people that like live in this house

3307
05:26:14,819 --> 05:26:17,060
That's kind of weird. No, I don't do that

3308
05:26:23,860 --> 05:26:28,220
You fucking imagine how much of a weird motherfucker you have to be

3309
05:26:29,099 --> 05:26:31,740
To when I broadcast I just broadcast

3310
05:26:32,360 --> 05:26:38,779

3311
05:26:38,779 --> 05:26:42,700
No, I I always i'm pretty much shirtless every moment of the day unless i'm

3312
05:26:43,340 --> 05:26:45,340
Driving around somewhere we could go somewhere

3313
05:26:45,979 --> 05:26:56,750

05:27:04,240 --> 05:27:06,240

Uh, thank you too

3323
05:27:37,630 --> 05:27:40,669
Uh raslik corgon for the five dolls

3324
05:27:41,470 --> 05:27:46,110
Hey jerma, i'm thinking about jumping into the world of streaming even if I get just 10 viewers think it'll be a blast

3325
05:27:46,830 --> 05:27:51,569
Any advice you're willing to share?

3326
05:27:51,569 --> 05:27:53,569
You are you're already on the right track

3327
05:27:53,569 --> 05:27:58,080
Do it because you want to do it because you think it'll be fun

3328
05:28:00,000 --> 05:28:02,000
You already got the right, uh mindset so

3329
05:28:03,279 --> 05:28:08,849
Give it a try

3330
05:28:08,849 --> 05:28:17,759
You got step one

3331
05:28:17,759 --> 05:28:23,459
Take sure no

3332
05:28:23,860 --> 05:28:25,860
The thing is people ask me advice for streaming

3333
05:28:27,619 --> 05:28:29,759
but

3334
05:28:29,759 --> 05:28:31,759
I don't know what the fuck i'm doing

3335
05:28:37,439 --> 05:28:42,180
At all

3336
05:28:42,180 --> 05:28:44,180
I don't even know how to turn the stream on sometimes

3337
05:28:51,069 --> 05:28:54,610
We know

3338
05:28:54,610 --> 05:29:00,049
No, but in all honestly it

3339
05:29:00,049 --> 05:29:01,650
There's no real

3340
05:29:01,650 --> 05:29:03,729
There's no real blanket advice that's possible to give

3341
05:29:05,220 --> 05:29:11,860
Just because of the nature of the platform it's it's a bunch think about what the platform is right twitch.tv or any streaming platform even youtube

3342
05:29:11,860 --> 05:29:14,000
You can add this together

3343
05:29:14,000 --> 05:29:15,200
You have

3344
05:29:15,200 --> 05:29:19,840
A bunch of people who are all streaming right right now. There's a bunch of oh, well, can you hear me?

3345
05:29:20,319 --> 05:29:21,840
Or did we lose?

3346
05:29:21,840 --> 05:29:26,659
I think we're good

3347
05:29:26,659 --> 05:29:30,900
uh, what I was saying is you have a bunch of people that are doing this sort of thing at the same time

3348
05:29:32,720 --> 05:29:33,680
and

3349
05:29:33,680 --> 05:29:35,040
trying to

3350
05:29:35,200 --> 05:29:40,959
Maneuver your way around and find some kind of audience or some people that would be fun to hang around with or

3351
05:29:41,599 --> 05:29:43,599
Some people that you want to stream to

3352
05:29:44,159 --> 05:29:47,360
You kind of have to make your own brand right make your own

3353
05:29:48,639 --> 05:29:50,639
Um way that you know how

3354
05:29:50,959 --> 05:29:54,349
Because there are a lot of ways to do it

3355
05:29:55,650 --> 05:29:59,090
You know, are you really good at something like a video game? Are you like top?

3356
05:29:59,650 --> 05:30:06,610
10 percentile in a particular game. That's a that's worth watching. Can you do something really fast? That's worth watching

3357
05:30:07,250 --> 05:30:11,729
Can you make like jokes do people think that you're funny and that's worth watching right?

3358
05:30:12,610 --> 05:30:15,889
There's a lot of avenues that you can go down to start a stream

3359
05:30:24,590 --> 05:30:28,590
So what might be right for you or right? What what might be right for me?

3360
05:30:29,630 --> 05:30:36,060
Um might not be the same for anybody else because I really don't have a way to

3361
05:30:36,700 --> 05:30:40,860
Here's what you need to do step one step two step three because I I don't know. I really don't know

3362
05:30:42,930 --> 05:30:45,250
Just try to do something and try to do something that you're good at

3363
05:30:46,319 --> 05:31:03,180
And see what happens did this internet kill the stream? No, we were we were teetering around for a little bit

3364
05:31:03,180 --> 05:31:12,369
It was still okay

3365
05:31:12,369 --> 05:31:16,849
People shouldn't go into something with the brand in mind. No, no, but that's not what I mean by that is

3366
05:31:19,740 --> 05:31:22,060
You just kind of have to do whatever you want to do

3367
05:31:24,830 --> 05:31:28,509
Most of the people that started doing this just did it because they felt like doing it one day

3368
05:31:30,430 --> 05:31:35,790
And it was just I want to make a video. I'm just gonna make it and i'm gonna put it up

3369
05:31:36,509 --> 05:31:39,549
Did anybody watch my first five videos no

3370
05:31:41,740 --> 05:31:43,740
My first 10 videos, maybe a few

3371
05:31:44,669 --> 05:31:47,549
I just kept doing it because I just was having a great time

3372
05:31:48,189 --> 05:31:50,189
I was just having a lot of fun

3373
05:31:50,349 --> 05:31:53,259
Making a video

3374
05:31:53,259 --> 05:31:57,500
And in the initial stages it was it was almost to see if I could even do it in the first place

3375
05:32:10,099 --> 05:32:13,439
We all watched germa craft. Yeah, but that was

3376
05:32:14,529 --> 05:32:19,659
That was like 50 videos in I knew what I was doing at that point. I had everything figured out

3377
05:32:20,459 --> 05:32:25,650
But I wish you the best of luck I

3378
05:32:25,889 --> 05:32:27,889
I wish there was more advice I could give

3379
05:32:27,970 --> 05:32:30,979
But I don't really have any

3380
05:32:30,979 --> 05:32:41,220
If i'm completely honest

3381
05:32:41,220 --> 05:32:46,000
Germa craft was the pinnacle. I disagree, but that's okay

3382
05:32:53,939 --> 05:32:55,939
You've seen me in the servers

3383
05:32:56,259 --> 05:32:59,229
What's the best video you think you ever made? I mean that's kind of

3384
05:33:00,029 --> 05:33:02,080
That's very skewed

3385
05:33:02,080 --> 05:33:08,430
I made a germa rumble live action was just that's probably the best video and it's like the last video I ever made

3386
05:33:09,310 --> 05:33:14,540
Maybe castle griffin steed just like put a lot of time into them

3387
05:33:15,180 --> 05:33:17,729
Thought they were a lot of fun to make

3388
05:33:17,729 --> 05:33:27,860
I have a lot of videos that I remember very very fondly

3389
05:33:29,060 --> 05:33:36,610
What video embarrasses you to think about?

3390
05:33:37,810 --> 05:33:39,810
every modern warfare 3 video

3391
05:33:39,970 --> 05:33:43,279
I actually uploaded a video that was a 14 and 7

3392
05:33:44,319 --> 05:33:48,560
Kill confirmed gameplay and I thought that that was a good I thought that was it at the time

3393
05:33:49,119 --> 05:33:53,520
That was okay to upload for me. It was like yeah, this is this is good. I'm gonna I'll upload that

3394
05:33:56,349 --> 05:33:58,909
14 and 7 kill confirmed and I thought it was yeah

3395
05:34:00,529 --> 05:34:05,650
But this is listen. This is back before let me i'm gonna go off on a little thing here. This is back before

3396
05:34:07,209 --> 05:34:09,310
Esports was really took off

3397
05:34:10,959 --> 05:34:15,279
And people were really good and all like the best players were coming out and and and being

3398
05:34:15,759 --> 05:34:20,400
Noticed and and good gameplay really good gameplay was something that was sought after at that point

3399
05:34:21,279 --> 05:34:23,520
This is like 2011 2012

3400
05:34:28,110 --> 05:34:29,310
I used to make

3401
05:34:29,310 --> 05:34:31,630
Tip videos on how to play the scout

3402
05:34:45,090 --> 05:34:48,930
The heart defended your iphone game video saying that you were genuine casual

3403
05:34:50,590 --> 05:34:53,630
Yeah, playing iphone games in bed is not the same of

3404
05:34:54,750 --> 05:34:59,840
You know what I mean?

3405
05:34:59,840 --> 05:35:01,459
but yeah

3406
05:35:01,459 --> 05:35:03,459
Being really good at a video game

3407
05:35:04,020 --> 05:35:06,740
Really started to take off like just about five years ago

3408
05:35:07,700 --> 05:35:12,340
All the esports teams started to really form and started to make teams started to compete

3409
05:35:13,139 --> 05:35:16,119
Money real big money started to get involved in competitions

3410
05:35:21,159 --> 05:35:25,880
That was like 2012 2013 is when that really started

3411
05:35:34,389 --> 05:35:35,270
but

3412
05:35:35,270 --> 05:35:45,619
It's an interesting space. We're in it was way earlier than that

3413
05:35:47,919 --> 05:35:49,520
Yeah, but

3414
05:35:49,520 --> 05:35:52,720
I mean, I don't know because think about like even like youtube

3415
05:35:54,270 --> 05:35:56,270
2010 2011

3416
05:35:57,299 --> 05:36:02,500
That was like the call of duty youtubers were just starting to really be popular and

3417
05:36:04,500 --> 05:36:06,720
Esports hadn't really

3418
05:36:06,720 --> 05:36:11,279
Taken off that much online entertainment for video games hadn't really

3419
05:36:12,000 --> 05:36:14,000
It was just starting to happen

3420
05:36:14,080 --> 05:36:20,680
back in like 2008

3421
05:36:20,900 --> 05:36:26,520
2007 2008 2009 you would get your channel deleted if you uploaded video game

3422
05:36:27,240 --> 05:36:28,360
footage

3423
05:36:28,360 --> 05:36:31,080
Like straight up your channel is terminated

3424
05:36:31,810 --> 05:36:34,209
back in like 2000 before like 2010

3425
05:36:34,849 --> 05:36:48,400
Somewhere in like the 2005 2006 2007 when they really started to introduce all that stuff

3426
05:36:51,720 --> 05:36:53,560
Yeah, they i'm like

3427
05:36:53,560 --> 05:36:57,240
I think there was specific cases of people uploading gta 4 footage

3428
05:36:58,340 --> 05:37:00,500
And just it just been instantly removed

3429
05:37:07,409 --> 05:37:11,569
Yeah, this is but you couldn't even upload videos longer than 10 minutes. Yeah, it was crazy

3430
05:37:18,740 --> 05:37:25,840
2010 is the year that online video game media really was starting to take off

3431
05:37:34,930 --> 05:37:37,409
Yeah, you used to have to get approved for 15 minute videos

3432
05:37:43,619 --> 05:37:45,619
Video responses. Oh, yeah

3433
05:37:47,169 --> 05:37:50,450
Yeah

3434
05:37:50,450 --> 05:37:55,909
You might think that that's a long time ago. That's not that long ago that really I mean like 2010 2011

3435
05:37:56,770 --> 05:37:58,770
That's less than 10 years ago

3436
05:37:58,770 --> 05:38:10,150
I mean, it's not like it was like 20 years ago or something. It was really like eight-ish plus years ago almost

3437
05:38:12,419 --> 05:38:15,619
You had so much hair back then. I actually had a lot less hair because I had it short

3438
05:38:16,099 --> 05:38:20,500
I cut my hair really short

3439
05:38:20,500 --> 05:38:22,500
10 years is still a good bit. Yeah, it is

3440
05:38:25,159 --> 05:38:29,479
But in this last 10 years, we've seen such a monumental surge

3441
05:38:30,759 --> 05:38:34,119
in attention to like the gaming communities the gaming world

3442
05:38:36,020 --> 05:38:37,619
I remember when

3443
05:38:37,619 --> 05:38:39,139
smite

3444
05:38:39,139 --> 05:38:44,340
Had that 2.6 million dollar tournament and i remember being like, holy fuck man. That's

3445
05:38:45,119 --> 05:38:46,659
insanity

3446
05:38:46,659 --> 05:38:54,849
That's crazy

3447
05:38:55,250 --> 05:39:00,450
There was a big dota one four or five years ago. What was the one was like 10 million bucks or something like that 10

3448
05:39:01,490 --> 05:39:03,430
8 million

3449
05:39:03,430 --> 05:39:05,430
That's when it was really like holy shit

3450
05:39:06,630 --> 05:39:09,509
You mean I can I can be I can make millions of dollars doing this

3451
05:39:12,919 --> 05:39:14,919
Yeah, when was the first international?

3452
05:39:17,799 --> 05:39:26,619
That'll probably give you a good indicator. I remember reading that article of the first international

3453
05:39:27,619 --> 05:39:29,619
Yeah, 2011 2010

3454
05:39:31,799 --> 05:39:34,680
The international has a price pool of 20 million dollars. Yeah, that's

3455
05:39:35,159 --> 05:39:43,330
It's an insane amount of money

3456
05:39:43,330 --> 05:39:53,830
Yeah, it's weird 18. It was not an 1800. Remember the gaming at the olympics video you called it

3457
05:39:55,110 --> 05:39:57,110
Yeah, people told me I was wrong

3458
05:39:59,250 --> 05:40:02,450
Jeremy in quotes always write 9 8 5

3459
05:40:07,439 --> 05:40:09,919
I'm gonna i'm gonna shave that into the back of my head

3460
05:40:19,200 --> 05:40:22,400
You really did have such a galaxy brain prediction though

3461
05:40:27,250 --> 05:40:34,689
Yeah, too bad back in like 2010 2011 2012. I was doing galaxy brain gaming

3462
05:40:35,169 --> 05:40:38,049
Community predictions and not like buying bitcoin

3463
05:40:39,459 --> 05:40:42,659
Too bad. I didn't have that kind of galaxy brain intuition, huh?

3464
05:40:43,299 --> 05:40:55,779
It's always good. It always goes back to crypto

3465
05:40:56,259 --> 05:41:00,209
All right, let's uh, we'll move on though

3466
05:41:00,209 --> 05:41:06,049
Good talk though. Good good talk. Very good talk. Thank you, too

3467
05:41:07,279 --> 05:41:10,319
Uh lobotomized teddy bear for the two dollars and 75 cents

3468
05:41:11,060 --> 05:41:14,659
Jerma i'm an intern at the smithsonian. One of my jobs is web maintenance

3469
05:41:14,819 --> 05:41:17,459
If you could not possibly crash our site, that would be great

3470
05:41:18,689 --> 05:41:25,459
Also do an irl gardening stream. It'd be

3471
05:41:26,099 --> 05:41:28,150
more embarrassing

3472
05:41:28,150 --> 05:41:30,389
Than me trying to do it in the digital world

3473
05:41:32,259 --> 05:41:35,840
I don't think I would be able to do that

3474
05:41:35,840 --> 05:41:40,959
I would rather do the get slapshotted by a professional hockey player in goalie equipment

3475
05:41:41,520 --> 05:41:43,680
then

3476
05:41:43,680 --> 05:41:47,880
Do a gardening stream

3477
05:41:47,880 --> 05:41:54,150
But thank you for the 275. Uh, we also had 250 from

3478
05:41:54,770 --> 05:41:57,119
Shalashaksha

3479
05:41:57,119 --> 05:42:01,439
I fuck up your name every time and i'm really sorry. I have my hardest finals tomorrow. Could you wish me luck?

3480
05:42:01,439 --> 05:42:05,840
Good luck

3481
05:42:05,840 --> 05:42:11,430
Hopefully you do well on your finals. Hopefully you get some good grades

3482
05:42:11,990 --> 05:42:19,110
And then you relax because you earned it, you know, you've earned it. Good luck

3483
05:42:21,240 --> 05:42:27,400
Uh velemi gave 50 dollars while we were in the middle of that conversation a little while ago. Thank you velemi

3484
05:42:28,770 --> 05:42:30,770
5,000 bits 50 bucks

3485
05:42:30,849 --> 05:42:33,560
Thank you for the large large amount of money

3486
05:42:34,819 --> 05:42:37,860
Don't forget to chug a few mountain dew throwbacks before the operation

3487
05:42:38,419 --> 05:42:45,279
Yeah, I forgot about that. I have like streamer amnesia

3488
05:42:52,200 --> 05:42:55,319
No, I can't do it. I I think I can only have jello

3489
05:42:56,400 --> 05:42:58,560
And chicken broth for a day and a half

3490
05:43:00,040 --> 05:43:01,799
God, that's gonna suck

3491
05:43:08,770 --> 05:43:12,790
Yeah, you can't have anything red

3492
05:43:12,790 --> 05:43:15,669
I'm one of those people where I lose my mind if I can't eat

3493
05:43:16,470 --> 05:43:18,150
I am going to eat

3494
05:43:18,150 --> 05:43:21,409
I don't know. Maybe I should just eat

3495
05:43:21,409 --> 05:43:26,290
Should I just drink like a banana peanut butter smoothie the day before that like a

3496
05:43:27,069 --> 05:43:29,069
4,000 calorie banana

3497
05:43:29,090 --> 05:43:33,729
Sludge peanut butter smoothie like the day before I can't eat anything

3498
05:43:35,430 --> 05:43:37,750
Should I do that? Maybe that'll like keep me full

3499
05:43:45,380 --> 05:43:51,439
Think of the shit. Jeremy, did you eat anything a day or two ago?

3500
05:43:51,919 --> 05:43:53,990
Uh, why?

3501
05:43:53,990 --> 05:43:55,720
Just did you?

3502
05:43:55,720 --> 05:43:59,720
Yeah, I had a 4,000 calorie two full jar of peanut butter smoothie

3503
05:44:00,819 --> 05:44:03,619
Oh, well, that's why I can't see anything

3504
05:44:04,259 --> 05:44:10,159
It's still going through

3505
05:44:10,159 --> 05:44:12,000

3525
05:45:46,470 --> 05:45:48,069

3585
05:49:55,240 --> 05:49:57,200

Hugh or hwag. Thanks for the ten dollars a few minutes ago

3594
05:50:25,279 --> 05:50:28,310
Thanks for the ten bucks

3595
05:50:28,310 --> 05:50:33,490
They say hey jerma, I recently used you as one of my influences for my senior legacy project at school

3596
05:50:34,049 --> 05:50:38,930
I put the blood in the box clip in my video presentation and no one left

3597
05:50:47,240 --> 05:50:51,959
Well to to think that that video is funny. You have to under I guess you have to like understand

3598
05:50:52,599 --> 05:50:54,599
the like loot box craze

3599
05:50:55,639 --> 05:50:56,759
that

3600
05:50:56,759 --> 05:51:02,279
Streamers and youtubers were really pushing and showing and it was kind of a craze for a year or two

3601
05:51:03,000 --> 05:51:05,490
You kind of had to be there, right?

3602
05:51:11,970 --> 05:51:13,970
Time to get a new identity

3603
05:51:14,369 --> 05:51:21,590
You're just gonna be the blood box guy. Oh, no

3604
05:51:23,349 --> 05:51:27,409
Don't worry, like show them like a cool video. Is there a video wherever it like was cool?

3605
05:51:28,130 --> 05:51:32,869
Have I made a video where I've ever been cool?

3606
05:51:33,270 --> 05:51:36,229
Well, he was like, holy shit. That was fucking that was cool man. What he said

3607
05:51:37,029 --> 05:51:43,439
Lifting the weights. Yeah. Oh, absolutely. Show them the chip. No, but why would you do that? That'd be weird

3608
05:51:43,919 --> 05:51:47,439
Hey, look at this guy lifting weights on camera. Why would you show people that?

3609
05:51:48,000 --> 05:51:53,380
That'd be weird to show if we're just out of context

3610
05:51:54,310 --> 05:51:58,770
It's cool though

3611
05:51:58,770 --> 05:52:03,330
I've actually thought about this a lot before I don't believe there's any video of jerma's I could show to a friend

3612
05:52:04,209 --> 05:52:06,130
Me either

3613
05:52:06,130 --> 05:52:17,520
So we can both agree on that

3614
05:52:19,840 --> 05:52:22,279
It's cool

3615
05:52:22,279 --> 05:52:25,560
All right guys, I will try again tomorrow. We'll see you soon

3616
05:52:26,659 --> 05:52:28,659

3618
05:52:32,500 --> 05:52:37,700
And keep an eye on the sus I will give you an update tomorrow morning tomorrow afternoon again like I did today

3619
05:52:38,259 --> 05:52:41,459
I'm gonna get some sleep. I'm gonna get some food. Hopefully it's a pepperoni pizza

3620
05:52:42,529 --> 05:52:44,930
It will be a pepperoni pizza because that's probably what i'm gonna order

3621
05:52:45,569 --> 05:52:47,250
Have a great night

3622
05:52:47,250 --> 05:52:49,250
Take care. See you real soon
