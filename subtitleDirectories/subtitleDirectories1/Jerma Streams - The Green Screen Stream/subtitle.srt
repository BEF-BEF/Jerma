1
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:11,779
I want to know how bad this microphone is.

2
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:16,280
Am I coming out like one side of your ear?

3
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:25,420
It sounds great. Well, it's about to sound probably way worse.

4
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:32,729
You got atmosphere.

5
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,490
That's what you got with me.

6
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:39,479
You know, I was going to do like this.

7
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:41,000
Camera's not working.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,679
Uh, there is no camera.

9
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:47,530
I'm in my living room right now.

10
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,530
Like, oh, green screen stream.

11
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,670
I painted my living room wall green.

12
00:00:54,310 --> 00:01:04,150
I hope it looks alright.

13
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:11,060
Yeah, it's like I painted it like it's like a it's like a green slash blue.

14
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,180
It might not work.

15
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:18,549
So by the way, how are we doing?

16
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:35,739
Let's get it started right now.

17
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,549
That's a lot of space.

18
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:47,689
I haven't even done anything yet.

19
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:48,489
We just started.

20
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,150
I got a big living room, guys.

21
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:52,950
You understand?

22
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,219
I got props over here.

23
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:00,540
I got there's a lot of shit I have here.

24
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,480
I'm going to take this slow because I need to make sure

25
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,879
that I took a long time trying to get this correct.

26
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,360
I might need a little more light this way.

27
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,490
I'm saying like here, maybe a little bit like right.

28
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:25,500
Let me see.

29
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:32,870
Is anybody else here with me?

30
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:39,139
No, let me do this.

31
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,439
Take the mic with me.

32
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:45,370
I can't take the mic with me.

33
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,090
That's not going to work.

34
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:56,659
All right, let me make sure that this is correct.

35
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:08,520
All right, let me just let me turn this up a little so we can see.

36
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,599
What if I do this?

37
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,900
That makes it a little better, right?

38
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:24,340
That actually looks all right.

39
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:28,090
And we're in 60 FPS.

40
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:35,849
The 60 FPS, right?

41
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:40,169
That's what this thing is, right?

42
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:40,650
Can you see?

43
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:42,409
You can see all the frames, right?

44
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:56,340
That's yeah, 720p.

45
00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:01,719
Yeah, to get to do 60, I have to do 720.

46
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:05,000
So this is 720p 60 from motion.

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,919
I can do 1080p 30, but I don't think it'll look as good

48
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,319
because I was doing it and I was moving around.

49
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:15,639
It was like you couldn't even it was hard to tell what I was even doing.

50
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:25,259
Try 1080.

51
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:26,949
Hold on.

52
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:28,550
You guys tell me, okay?

53
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:33,449
You tell me if 1080 looks better because I tried them both.

54
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:41,860
So this is 1080 30.

55
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:46,779
Let me move that.

56
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:56,600
I'll do some karate chops.

57
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,899
Don't worry.

58
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:00,779
Now, so this is 1080.

59
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:03,019
This is 1080 30.

60
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:07,829
So you see what I'm saying?

61
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:18,569
It's like bring it back.

62
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:21,319
Wait, wait, hold on a second.

63
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:21,959
Hold on.

64
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:27,860
Hold on a second.

65
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,300
This is this is 1080 30.

66
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:32,970
What would you rather have?

67
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,250
Higher quality image or faster karate chops?

68
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:36,970
Do you see what I'm saying?

69
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,129
60 fps versus disgusting 30 fps.

70
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,129
Well, we can do both.

71
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:08,089
We can do both.

72
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:13,639
Let me just make sure we got hold on.

73
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,579
Let me get this.

74
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,730
One second.

75
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:27,100
Hold on.

76
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,040
1080.

77
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,819
I'll give you 1080 like roundhouse kick and you see the differences, okay?

78
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:45,910
Well, you do think I could do roundhouse kicks.

79
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:46,389
Oh, wow.

80
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:48,550
I didn't know German could do roundhouse kicks, huh?

81
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:59,670
All right, now let's take a look at that.

82
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,629
It's 60.

83
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:06,899
You tell me which one you want more.

84
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:15,990
Here we go.

85
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:25,930
60 fps.

86
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:46,629
Okay, there we go.

87
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:47,829
All right, here's 60.

88
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:48,329
Ready?

89
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:51,370
I'll give you a roundhouse kick at 60.

90
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,740
60 or 1080.

91
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,939
You want better quality or you want...

92
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:12,180
Wait, it's blurry.

93
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:18,180
Maybe I hold on a second here.

94
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:18,500
Hold on.

95
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,560
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

96
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,920
Oh, hold on a second, guys.

97
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:31,290
Oh, whoops.

98
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,500
Okay.

99
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,899
60 fps is nice, but doesn't look good.

100
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:48,659
All right, we'll do 1080 for a while.

101
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:54,230
Here's 1080.

102
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,440
Can I like force it to 60?

103
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,080
I don't think I can.

104
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,690
But I don't think I could even...

105
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,690
That 1080 60 would be bad.

106
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,049
I can't stream from here on 1080 60.

107
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:06,250
This wouldn't work.

108
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:19,000
Hey, let me...

109
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,559
Hold on a second.

110
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,759
Everybody stay where you are, okay?

111
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:24,330
I'm gonna...

112
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,049
I'm gonna...

113
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:30,409
I don't think I can stream it at like 6,000 or 7,000 from here.

114
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:32,009
I'm at 5,000 up.

115
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:36,250
I might be able to get away with 6,000 or 7,000.

116
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:36,649
I don't know.

117
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:38,230
Maybe not.

118
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,269
That's gonna be tricky.

119
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:48,100
I think this is good.

120
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,179
There is glare up here, though.

121
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:51,940
Over there.

122
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,820
There's glare right here.

123
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:57,720
All right.

124
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:07,990
Is it better?

125
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,100
I mean, it's...

126
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,860
This one needs to be dropping.

127
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,710
Uh-huh.

128
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,590
It's a process.

129
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:24,220
How's that?

130
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:24,539
Better?

131
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:30,389
I should say it's a lot better than mine.

132
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:36,940
But the bat...

133
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,059
I need to turn this one back on.

134
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:50,230
This one, not this one.

135
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,470
Okay.

136
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:57,259
This one is good.

137
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:05,289
This one is also all right.

138
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,799
Change shirt?

139
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,399
I got plenty of shirts.

140
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:28,740
All right.

141
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,539
I'm ready.

142
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:32,200
So I have...

143
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:33,399
Take a look.

144
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,279
You wanna see?

145
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:36,889
You wanna see what we're working with today?

146
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:42,460
I have about 100 actions.

147
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,259
Oops.

148
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:48,139
So I think this is as good as we're gonna get it.

149
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:50,659
Maybe a little bit hot.

150
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:51,379
No, that's all right.

151
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:13,159
It's a big living room.

152
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:15,639
Yeah, I got a 6,900 square foot house.

153
00:12:25,289 --> 00:12:25,610
All right.

154
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:30,759
I really wish I could get rid of that.

155
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:32,519
I don't think I can get rid of that.

156
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,490
I don't think that'll be a problem keying it, though.

157
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:40,840
Let me try this one thing.

158
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:55,269
That makes that brighter.

159
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:55,509
Okay.

160
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:56,470
I'm gonna keep it like this.

161
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,710
But give me one second where I find where these are.

162
00:13:00,169 --> 00:13:10,299
I don't know where they are.

163
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:10,539
Shit.

164
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:15,029
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

165
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:20,179
Okay, here we go.

166
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:20,659
Almost.

167
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:28,090
There's a little bit of glare on the sides here.

168
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:31,820
Am I making...

169
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,019
I'm casting shadows though.

170
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:37,450
It's perfect.

171
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:40,220
Okay.

172
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,539
Shadow.

173
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:52,169
All right.

174
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:53,769
So how we're gonna start this is...

175
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:54,009
All right.

176
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:55,049
I might as well just start.

177
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,820
Video editors can easily handle this.

178
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,220
Well, then I'm getting rid of the shadow.

179
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,740
Oh, you get...

180
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,399
You want the...

181
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:19,879
Go back?

182
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,500
Oh, God.

183
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:21,899
All right.

184
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:22,299
All right.

185
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:22,620
Fine.

186
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:28,759
Okay.

187
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,539
You good?

188
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:32,259
We cool with this?

189
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,490
Go back.

190
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,490
All right.

191
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,370
Here we go.

192
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:45,240
So the first thing that I want to do...

193
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,659
Let me make sure you can be seen here.

194
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:51,179
So I got a lot of space here, right?

195
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:51,740
As you can see.

196
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:58,379
I'm gonna do standing, walking, running.

197
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,539
I'm gonna do it all in the same...

198
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:20,629
How's that?

199
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:24,139
Give us a tour.

200
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,059
All right.

201
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:26,620
I think we're good.

202
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,970
So here's what you're gonna get.

203
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:33,080
Ready?

204
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:36,899
Begin!

205
00:15:37,460 --> 00:17:19,579
Watch.

206
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:22,859
Okay.

207
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:23,259
There you...

208
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:24,920
That's standing.

209
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,160
Okay.

210
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:29,750
We got...

211
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,990
You got like a couple of angles, a couple of close-ups, right?

212
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:37,819
We're gonna move on.

213
00:17:37,819 --> 00:17:38,539
You need more?

214
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:38,779
Okay.

215
00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:39,420
I'll give you another one.

216
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:39,980
Here.

217
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:45,720
We're just getting through the general motions, you know?

218
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,000
So here's another like standing.

219
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:58,900
Just like kind of doing whatever.

220
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,380
Good day.

221
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:26,789
You're my guy, right?

222
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:27,859
All right.

223
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:28,500
Now we're gonna do...

224
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:33,690
Louder.

225
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,250
I know...

226
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,210
Guys, you have to understand.

227
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,210
There are like a hundred of these.

228
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,890
I'm just getting the good ones.

229
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:39,609
They're not the good ones.

230
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:41,130
I'm just getting like the easy ones.

231
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,170
Can you mic up?

232
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,890
I don't have like a lav mic.

233
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:48,579
I'll be louder.

234
00:18:48,579 --> 00:18:49,059
Don't worry.

235
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:51,059
T-pose is on the list.

236
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:51,220
Okay.

237
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:51,619
Here we go.

238
00:18:51,619 --> 00:18:52,019
You ready?

239
00:18:52,579 --> 00:18:53,880
This is walking now.

240
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,359
Walking.

241
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:27,539
Some more...

242
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:29,059
I'll get some more walks for you.

243
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:38,779
I'll get you some walking in place.

244
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:57,579
Get some more walks here so it's a little bit hot.

245
00:19:57,579 --> 00:19:58,779
A little bit more faster.

246
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:26,619
Close the camera.

247
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:30,970
What the fuck?

248
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:59,220
Now when he's running, it's like a break.

249
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,529
Faster?

250
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:46,150
He's coming.

251
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,660
Oh boy.

252
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,319
All right.

253
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,660
What else we got?

254
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,380
And that's it.

255
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:05,589
See you tomorrow.

256
00:22:05,589 --> 00:22:05,829
All right.

257
00:22:05,829 --> 00:22:10,279
I didn't bring any...

258
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:11,559
I brought coffee.

259
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:13,079
That's gonna drive me up.

260
00:22:15,819 --> 00:22:18,220
I need to go drink my water from this toilet sink.

261
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:25,829
I'm gonna go drink water out of the toilet.

262
00:22:25,829 --> 00:22:25,990
All right.

263
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:26,150
Hold on.

264
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:26,549
Here we go.

265
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,819
Next up is dashing, dodging, and crouching.

266
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:28,940
Crouching.

267
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:36,569
Walk in.

268
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:11,930
Wait.

269
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,369
Autofocus turned on.

270
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:21,180
Should've.

271
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,299
Stepping off screen.

272
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:24,630
Yeah.

273
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,190
I have to.

274
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,500
Autofocus shouldn't be on.

275
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,839
I just recalibrated.

276
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:33,160
All right.

277
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,640
Here we go.

278
00:24:35,529 --> 00:24:35,849
Next.

279
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:44,980
I'm gonna like tire myself out right now.

280
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,710
Punch.

281
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,569
Being punched.

282
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:49,740
Kick.

283
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,319
Being kicked.

284
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:58,779
Being hit with objects.

285
00:24:58,779 --> 00:24:59,259
Fuck me.

286
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:09,450
I gotta change my clothes soon here.

287
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,089
All right.

288
00:25:10,089 --> 00:25:12,339
Let's do it.

289
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:24,619
I'm doing like all the Mortal Kombat moves.

290
00:25:24,619 --> 00:25:37,289
Get the fuck out of here.

291
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:37,769
Yep.

292
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:45,079
I don't want to fight you.

293
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:45,880
I don't want to.

294
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,720
I don't want to fight you, man.

295
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,039
I don't...

296
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,579
I didn't want to knock you out, but I didn't.

297
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,369
Oh, did you think I was going to catch it?

298
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:09,900
That's it.

299
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,019
Broken bones.

300
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:12,779
That's it.

301
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,059
And the ground.

302
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:19,289
How are you going to use that?

303
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,180
My shoelace came untied.

304
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,460
All right.

305
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,549
Kicks.

306
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:44,220
Oh, I just ripped my pants.

307
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,859
My pants almost just ripped in half.

308
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,539
Holy shit.

309
00:26:51,339 --> 00:26:57,940
Oh, yeah?

310
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:03,799
That's two backhands.

311
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:09,819
Ooh, two.

312
00:27:09,819 --> 00:27:16,259
I'm supposed to be doing kicks.

313
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:20,500
We'll do one of these.

314
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:45,980
Try again.

315
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:49,819
Fuck you.

316
00:27:49,819 --> 00:27:50,299
All right.

317
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:51,019
I got to get hit.

318
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:51,660
I got to get hit.

319
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,039
Face.

320
00:27:58,039 --> 00:27:58,599
Each arm.

321
00:27:58,599 --> 00:27:59,160
Each leg.

322
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:51,940
Why do I keep the puke?

323
00:28:58,329 --> 00:28:58,890
The shoe.

324
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,519
My shoe's untied.

325
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:01,480
God damn it.

326
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:08,730
I have to puke every time.

327
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:15,660
All right, we're done.

328
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:23,079
You.

329
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:24,279
It's time for you to pay.

330
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:27,289
You're going down.

331
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:35,859
The bigger they are, the harder they fall.

332
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:45,140
What is that?

333
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:51,099
All right.

334
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:55,529
Give me, let me get a toilet water break.

335
00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:56,329
I'll be right back.

336
00:29:56,329 --> 00:30:26,440
I haven't even gotten to the props yet, guys.

337
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,279
There's a bag of props over here.

338
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,359
There's a bag of props right there.

339
00:30:34,089 --> 00:30:34,809
All right.

340
00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:36,420
So that settles that.

341
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,259
Please do a fat roll.

342
00:30:38,259 --> 00:30:39,059
We'll get to that in a second.

343
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:39,380
Hold on.

344
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:43,559
All right.

345
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:46,099
So climbing.

346
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:48,359
I'm going to climb.

347
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,900
Climb.

348
00:30:55,819 --> 00:31:05,259
Let's climb.

349
00:31:29,779 --> 00:31:38,339
Made it to the top.

350
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:50,470
That's not going to work.

351
00:31:50,470 --> 00:32:21,349
I can't do it.

352
00:32:21,349 --> 00:32:21,990
I can't do it.

353
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,710
I can't do it.

354
00:33:12,569 --> 00:33:13,210
Okay.

355
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:20,380
That doesn't even work.

356
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:20,859
All right, here we go.

357
00:33:20,859 --> 00:33:21,339
All right.

358
00:33:21,339 --> 00:33:27,829
Just a little.

359
00:33:27,829 --> 00:33:33,619
Because here is a flat surface right here, man.

360
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,920
I'm doing this the wrong way.

361
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:44,779
I have to do it this way.

362
00:33:44,779 --> 00:33:45,980
This does that.

363
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,259
This is what is here.

364
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:48,859
It's me.

365
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:49,980
I'm in front of a screen.

366
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,440
What the fuck am I doing?

367
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:53,980
That's better.

368
00:33:58,950 --> 00:33:59,829
Why am I on this?

369
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:00,630
Just go like this.

370
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,380
Why am I doing the struggling to get over a cliff?

371
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:14,650
I don't know why I'm into that right now.

372
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:15,849
That's you up there.

373
00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:16,650
Hey.

374
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:18,780
Can you throw me down a life raft or something?

375
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,190
No life raft.

376
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:21,750
Don't worry.

377
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,230
I'll get it.

378
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:28,219
My fucking pants just fell down.

379
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:34,090
Hey, can you give me a hand down here?

380
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:35,929
That's like a 400 foot jump.

381
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:38,329
I guess I'll give it a try.

382
00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:38,650
No, no.

383
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:39,530
Don't worry about me.

384
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:41,769
Two.

385
00:34:41,769 --> 00:34:42,090
Three.

386
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:47,110
No, I'm good, man.

387
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:51,590
I'm good.

388
00:34:51,590 --> 00:35:01,559
Idiot.

389
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:09,460
All right.

390
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,099
Cam back down.

391
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:10,820
Yeah, I'll get it.

392
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:15,800
All right.

393
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,460
Now, now we're going to do facial reactions.

394
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:30,070
Cam down.

395
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:30,630
Oh, no, I will.

396
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,269
I will.

397
00:35:31,269 --> 00:35:33,639
I got to get these, though.

398
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:39,719
It's like, right, right.

399
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:40,760
It's good, right?

400
00:35:40,760 --> 00:36:05,289
Say it again.

401
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:17,750
Come on.

402
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,789
These are close-ups.

403
00:36:18,789 --> 00:36:20,309
These are close-ups.

404
00:36:20,309 --> 00:36:22,869
So you can get my facial reactions.

405
00:36:22,869 --> 00:36:23,590
Come on, right?

406
00:36:23,590 --> 00:37:10,820
Please.

407
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,260
It's my birthday today.

408
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,380
Thanks, everybody.

409
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,820
No, that's supposed to be a surprise birthday party.

410
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,380
Come on.

411
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:27,619
I mean, why is it so dark in here?

412
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:28,340
Honey?

413
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,360
Honey?

414
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,170
Oh, it's my birthday.

415
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:50,230
The doorknob is up at his chest.

416
00:37:50,230 --> 00:38:09,659
Can I just put it right here?

417
00:38:09,659 --> 00:38:10,699
Right on the chin.

418
00:38:10,699 --> 00:38:12,219
Right on the chin.

419
00:38:12,219 --> 00:38:13,019
Right there.

420
00:38:13,019 --> 00:38:19,659
Ooh.

421
00:38:19,659 --> 00:38:21,019
Ear lawsuit inbound.

422
00:38:21,019 --> 00:38:21,980
Oh, I'm sorry.

423
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:27,269
Throw some punches the other way.

424
00:38:27,269 --> 00:38:32,469
So you think about this brain screen, right?

425
00:38:32,469 --> 00:38:33,849
Get close, like here.

426
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:35,989
I need to, like, blow it out.

427
00:38:35,989 --> 00:38:40,170
It's designed for me to be, like, standing here.

428
00:38:40,889 --> 00:38:45,429
But, dude, I didn't release full-body stuff.

429
00:38:45,429 --> 00:38:46,710
Maybe I'll blow it out and get some more.

430
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:54,099
Do some more screaming.

431
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:59,400
Too much head room.

432
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,739
Ah, I mean, but that's all I got for the green on the bottom, though.

433
00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:07,699
I mean, in the editing program, right, you'll just take it.

434
00:39:08,969 --> 00:39:12,409
You'll just take this side and this side and just get it from here, you know?

435
00:39:12,409 --> 00:39:14,889
So hopefully this is not going to be too much of a blowout.

436
00:39:14,889 --> 00:39:17,239
I don't think it will be.

437
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:19,639
But I'll do some more of this stuff with the back blown out.

438
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:27,429
So there is no shadow at all.

439
00:39:27,429 --> 00:39:29,019
Anyways, let's get going.

440
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:34,900
I hope you brought green clothes.

441
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,659
Well, I guess, here, hold on.

442
00:39:40,659 --> 00:39:41,780
I can do this.

443
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,820
Let me test something here.

444
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:47,639
Because I have, like, a tester.

445
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,610
Let's see how it works.

446
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:59,000
Okay, let me just get it on here.

447
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:07,449
Because this will be able to give us a good indication of how this is going to play out.

448
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:13,989
Let me loop it.

449
00:40:13,989 --> 00:40:14,710
Then you tell me.

450
00:40:15,429 --> 00:40:40,039
Okay, let's get a green key on here.

451
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:46,949
And make sure I have it on there correctly.

452
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:56,260
Green!

453
00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:02,389
Why is this not doing it?

454
00:41:02,389 --> 00:41:07,110
Okay, let's take a look.

455
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,579
Ah, the beach!

456
00:41:21,139 --> 00:41:42,250
It's like, it's a little watery here.

457
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:43,690
It's a little too watery.

458
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,360
He's giant.

459
00:41:53,989 --> 00:41:58,900
Well, also, keep in mind, this is like, just, this is like the, I just have this through OBS.

460
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,820
You know what I mean?

461
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,940
So let me see if I do this.

462
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,900
This is just like the default settings through OBS.

463
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,019
You know what I'm saying?

464
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:17,940
If I mess with the settings a little bit.

465
00:42:26,309 --> 00:42:27,670
I'm transparent!

466
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:39,219
Let me see.

467
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:52,039
I mean, with playing around the settings, whoever is, you know, going to be using it,

468
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:54,409
I think it'll be all right.

469
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:03,739
Yeah!

470
00:43:12,949 --> 00:43:18,840
Okay, so I'm going to turn this off.

471
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:27,610
Don't worry, I'm getting in a full suit in doing a weather report, guys.

472
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:28,250
Don't worry.

473
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:38,409
We just, we've only been live for 40 minutes.

474
00:43:38,409 --> 00:43:41,429
I got like, I got like another hour and a half worth of stuff to do.

475
00:43:41,429 --> 00:43:44,599
I just, I'm just doing the basics.

476
00:43:48,889 --> 00:43:50,650
It's nine more hours.

477
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:52,010
I don't know about that.

478
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:52,809
All right, so here you go.

479
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:58,090
So now, I gotta get chased.

480
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:00,090
And then I have to chase someone.

481
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:04,519
So that looks all right.

482
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:11,579
So here's the chase sequence.

483
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:15,590
So I'm going to be going from this way to that way.

484
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:17,829
So I have to chase, and then I have to chase somebody else.

485
00:44:24,949 --> 00:44:25,510
Get back here!

486
00:44:26,309 --> 00:44:27,110
You get back here!

487
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:29,500
Come here, you bastard!

488
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:34,489
Get the fuck out of the way!

489
00:44:34,489 --> 00:44:35,769
Get out of the way, you fucking idiot!

490
00:44:35,769 --> 00:44:36,650
Hey, come here!

491
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:37,210
Get back!

492
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:37,849
I don't know where to go.

493
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:43,059
I need, give me that!

494
00:44:43,699 --> 00:44:56,360
Okay.

495
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:01,619
Get over here!

496
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:03,219
Get out of the fucking way!

497
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:05,940
What?

498
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:11,380
I'm in the middle of a chase, that's all I hear.

499
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,840
That's all I hear.

500
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,340
Shut up.

501
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:14,820
Shut up!

502
00:45:20,329 --> 00:45:23,130
Hey, get in your car.

503
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:24,250
Hey, hey!

504
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:31,929
Get back here!

505
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:33,690
All right, now I gotta get chased.

506
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,139
Oh, Jesus!

507
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:49,050
Oh, no!

508
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:49,769
Please!

509
00:45:49,769 --> 00:45:50,329
Oh, my God!

510
00:46:11,829 --> 00:46:30,889
Right in my head!

511
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:32,179
Toilet water.

512
00:46:32,179 --> 00:46:33,139
Be right back.

513
00:46:33,139 --> 00:47:20,710
Jesus, running in place is so much fucking harder

514
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:21,989
than just running in general.

515
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,800
Getting winded after light exercise.

516
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,159
No, it's the running in place.

517
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:38,219
All right.

518
00:47:38,219 --> 00:47:40,860
Now I gotta walk backwards, terrified of something.

519
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,300
Don't worry, I'm going to do death animations.

520
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:44,699
Don't worry.

521
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:57,539
We need some up close stuff, too.

522
00:47:57,539 --> 00:47:58,260
Like, chasing.

523
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,780
Like, so you can get from like here,

524
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:02,739
from like, you know, from here up.

525
00:48:07,269 --> 00:48:21,449
Oh, not hungry.

526
00:48:21,449 --> 00:48:22,329
What the fuck?

527
00:48:28,809 --> 00:48:29,130
Really?

528
00:48:29,849 --> 00:48:30,329
Really?

529
00:48:30,329 --> 00:48:31,130
Dude, really?

530
00:48:53,699 --> 00:49:01,239
Really, Scoob?

531
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:01,800
Okay.

532
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:09,500
Away from something.

533
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:17,989
Yes.

534
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:20,420
Just trying to go to the bathroom.

535
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:31,539
Easy.

536
00:49:32,179 --> 00:49:33,269
Easy.

537
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,039
You got something to say?

538
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,739
Oh, look at me!

539
00:49:49,739 --> 00:49:50,699
Look at me!

540
00:49:50,699 --> 00:50:15,130
Look at me!

541
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:16,570
Stop running.

542
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:23,539
All right, I mean.

543
00:50:23,539 --> 00:50:25,380
Isn't that just wonderful?

544
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:26,500
Oh, look at me!

545
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:31,000
Fucking idiot.

546
00:50:33,559 --> 00:50:35,639
I'm the man.

547
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:43,380
I'm the man.

548
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:43,880
Oh!

549
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,760
Hey, fellas!

550
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,599
He thinks he's dumb!

551
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:51,019
Look at me!

552
00:50:51,019 --> 00:51:08,280
Was the girl the best?

553
00:51:09,659 --> 00:51:14,760
Hey, look at me!

554
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,039
Ah, yeah, that's right!

555
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:23,110
I don't know why I'm doing that.

556
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:26,380
Stop.

557
00:51:27,019 --> 00:51:28,539
Stop doing this.

558
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:40,329
All right, ready?

559
00:51:41,659 --> 00:51:42,059
Next!

560
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:45,670
Oh, god.

561
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:46,869
This is where we're going to get weird.

562
00:51:47,429 --> 00:52:20,340
There's your T-pose.

563
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:21,860
Let's get a close-up a little bit closer.

564
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:32,219
You're like, look at me!

565
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:33,530
Loser.

566
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:34,170
Loser.

567
00:52:40,099 --> 00:52:41,059
All sides.

568
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:50,170
Fucking really?

569
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:51,369
All angles!

570
00:52:51,369 --> 00:53:17,829
I feel like I'm at the tailor.

571
00:53:33,539 --> 00:53:58,840
Good.

572
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,329
Scanning.

573
00:54:00,329 --> 00:54:01,769
Character select screen.

574
00:54:06,389 --> 00:54:07,110
Face scan.

575
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:08,789
Oh, my fucking god.

576
00:54:08,789 --> 00:54:09,590
Hold on.

577
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:18,099
Give me a second.

578
00:54:18,099 --> 00:54:22,650
I'll spin around.

579
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:28,969
What the hell is the editor?

580
00:54:28,969 --> 00:54:31,400
There it is.

581
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:31,880
Look at me.

582
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:37,159
So.

583
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:43,300
Yeah, it's really cool.

584
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,900
I sat in the chair and they did it.

585
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,019
They scanned me.

586
00:54:46,019 --> 00:54:50,619
And they always have this fucking weird face too.

587
00:55:02,059 --> 00:55:02,699
Too fast?

588
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,139
Well, the autofocus.

589
00:55:23,139 --> 00:55:24,179
Fucking autofocus.

590
00:55:25,449 --> 00:55:35,050
Stop autofocusing.

591
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:44,940
All right, I'm done.

592
00:56:24,329 --> 00:56:25,610
It gets smaller.

593
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:29,050
God.

594
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:37,179
All right.

595
00:56:37,179 --> 00:56:38,139
Do a close-up.

596
00:56:38,139 --> 00:56:38,699
Look at me.

597
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,360
I can't just do it.

598
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,320
I can't just do it.

599
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,099
What was it like?

600
00:56:50,099 --> 00:56:51,699
This and then like this.

601
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,449
I don't remember what it was.

602
00:56:55,449 --> 00:56:56,329
What did I do?

603
00:56:56,889 --> 00:56:58,739
I don't know what I did.

604
00:56:58,739 --> 00:57:07,500
I think it was like that and like that.

605
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,659
So you'd be like, huh.

606
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:11,590
You sure are talking a lot.

607
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:12,389
Oh, look at me.

608
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:17,820
No, I didn't do it right.

609
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:18,619
Oh, yeah.

610
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,539
Interesting thought process.

611
00:57:20,539 --> 00:57:21,500
Wait, look at me.

612
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,380
Look at me.

613
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:23,340
That's what you sound like.

614
00:57:27,159 --> 00:57:32,780
Why do I have to hit someone?

615
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:34,940
Why do I have to like slap somebody?

616
00:57:39,079 --> 00:57:42,170
Okay, this is where it gets real.

617
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:46,840
I see him down there.

618
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:47,880
Roger that.

619
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:48,679
Taking target out.

620
00:59:01,849 --> 00:59:04,010
And then like you've got like missiles coming at it.

621
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:04,409
But hold on.

622
00:59:04,409 --> 00:59:05,210
I didn't fit it.

623
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:11,050
So now you're going to take it from here.

624
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:40,300
This guy's 33.

625
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:43,670
Hand was outside.

626
00:59:57,929 --> 01:00:01,880
I can't balance for that long.

627
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:22,489
Why would I be flying like that?

628
01:00:22,489 --> 01:00:41,739
I got to get these done because it's going to fucking hurt.

629
01:01:42,489 --> 01:01:44,250
Time for a different shirt.

630
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:56,519
Toilet water.

631
01:01:56,519 --> 01:02:43,340
Oh, by the way, Germania 2018 is next weekend.

632
01:02:43,340 --> 01:03:04,179
Oh, what a drop.

633
01:03:04,179 --> 01:03:05,380
He dropped it.

634
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:06,579
He dropped it.

635
01:03:06,579 --> 01:03:09,480
All right, how are we doing?

636
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:13,940
We're doing all right.

637
01:03:14,019 --> 01:03:22,280
Okay, now I have to do a cliche superhero landing with a pose and a smirk.

638
01:03:40,519 --> 01:03:41,719
This is going to take me a few times.

639
01:03:41,719 --> 01:03:45,880
I don't like it.

640
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:50,969
What is this?

641
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:20,230
Find the center.

642
01:04:24,139 --> 01:04:25,900
Bitch, that's two.

643
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:26,699
I can't do it.

644
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:27,980
I hate it.

645
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:29,909
I hate it.

646
01:04:57,619 --> 01:05:00,809
You're expecting someone else.

647
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:23,460
I killed like 10 birds coming down.

648
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:26,809
I'm expecting someone else.

649
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:37,829
I didn't do it.

650
01:05:37,829 --> 01:05:41,940
Somehow I like punched the ground.

651
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:44,630
I actually did do the landing there.

652
01:06:25,909 --> 01:06:32,809
Why are you winding up your other hand?

653
01:06:32,809 --> 01:06:34,010
Wrong hand.

654
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:35,769
Hold on.

655
01:06:35,769 --> 01:06:37,289
So I went down with this.

656
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:44,280
All right, where's my phone?

657
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:45,159
I gotta see what the next thing is.

658
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:49,239
I haven't even gotten to the props.

659
01:06:53,559 --> 01:06:59,929
Okay, point around in amazement, horror, and excitement.

660
01:06:59,929 --> 01:07:20,300
Wow, you see?

661
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:23,030
I read about that.

662
01:07:23,030 --> 01:07:28,019
Nice.

663
01:07:28,019 --> 01:07:40,170
Look at that one.

664
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:40,650
Hey, mom.

665
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:42,010
Mom, I see it.

666
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:44,340
Yeah.

667
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:45,219
Wow.

668
01:07:45,219 --> 01:07:53,980
Is it right there or is it over here?

669
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:55,289
I can't tell.

670
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:13,099
Now, this is show business.

671
01:08:19,939 --> 01:08:22,409
Yeah, now that's show business.

672
01:08:22,409 --> 01:08:44,539
I'm doing right now.

673
01:08:44,539 --> 01:08:46,699
Spider-Man sweat mark.

674
01:08:46,699 --> 01:08:50,979
Where?

675
01:08:50,979 --> 01:09:02,789
Point in more directions.

676
01:09:02,789 --> 01:09:03,430
Okay.

677
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:12,390
I don't know.

678
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:15,880
Don't step in that.

679
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:53,560
I don't know what kind of step on that.

680
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,439
Buy a belt.

681
01:09:55,239 --> 01:09:56,680
I got too fat.

682
01:09:56,680 --> 01:10:08,739
Now we have to do horror.

683
01:10:08,739 --> 01:10:09,060
What?

684
01:10:09,699 --> 01:10:10,020
What?

685
01:10:10,579 --> 01:10:12,250
What is that?

686
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:13,770
What is that?

687
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:17,829
What is this thing right here?

688
01:10:17,829 --> 01:10:18,310
What?

689
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:19,750
What the fuck is that?

690
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:28,899
What is that?

691
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:43,770
What is that thing?

692
01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:45,130
What?

693
01:10:45,130 --> 01:10:46,579
What?

694
01:10:46,579 --> 01:10:48,420
What the fuck is that?

695
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:50,810
What's that?

696
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:52,310
What's that one?

697
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:52,949
What's that one?

698
01:10:52,949 --> 01:10:53,590
They're everywhere.

699
01:10:57,989 --> 01:11:00,500
Stay on.

700
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:00,819
Hold on.

701
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:09,590
That right there.

702
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:10,229
That's why.

703
01:11:11,829 --> 01:11:12,390
That's why.

704
01:11:20,739 --> 01:11:21,539
That right there.

705
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:23,779
That's the reason right there.

706
01:11:26,899 --> 01:11:27,699
I'm like lost.

707
01:11:30,579 --> 01:11:32,020
The follower button.

708
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:32,579
Hey, man.

709
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:34,340
Welcome to the stream.

710
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:35,300
My name's Jerma.

711
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:35,939
Nice to meet you.

712
01:11:35,939 --> 01:11:36,340
Right there.

713
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:36,899
Bingo.

714
01:11:36,899 --> 01:11:37,220
Right there.

715
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:38,100
That's the follow button.

716
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:38,739
If you click that,

717
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:41,539
every so often you're getting notified that I'm streaming.

718
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:45,539
And I do lots of fun things on this stream like

719
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:48,970
playing Hitman.

720
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:50,250
We played that last night.

721
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:53,140
That's right there.

722
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:55,819
Holy shit.

723
01:11:55,819 --> 01:11:56,460
Look at that hair.

724
01:12:01,909 --> 01:12:02,869
Right here, right?

725
01:12:02,869 --> 01:12:05,220
Hey, let me do you a favor.

726
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:12,890
So you made it to the YouTube homepage.

727
01:12:12,890 --> 01:12:13,449
How are you?

728
01:12:13,449 --> 01:12:14,409
My name's Frank.

729
01:12:14,409 --> 01:12:16,090
I'm your digital guy.

730
01:12:16,090 --> 01:12:17,529
As you see here,

731
01:12:17,529 --> 01:12:19,369
here's your viewing screen.

732
01:12:19,369 --> 01:12:20,890
This screen right here is going to show you

734
01:12:22,569 --> 01:12:24,409
from Gangnam style

735
01:12:24,409 --> 01:12:27,289
all the way to your grandma's outer fishing trip.

736
01:12:27,930 --> 01:12:28,970
This is right here.

737
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:30,329
This is your space.

738
01:12:30,489 --> 01:12:33,210

01:12:49,609 --> 01:12:53,449
and potentially lose their videos on your feed

749
01:12:53,449 --> 01:12:54,810
because we don't do that anymore,

750
01:12:54,810 --> 01:12:55,689
you have to click a bell.

751
01:12:55,689 --> 01:12:57,289
The bell's over here by the way.

752
01:12:57,289 --> 01:12:59,130
Click that bell right there.

753
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:00,649
And then click another couple of buttons.

754
01:13:00,649 --> 01:13:02,170
And then maybe you'll be able to see the content

755
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:02,970
you subscribe to.

756
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:04,810
This is your space.

757
01:13:05,770 --> 01:13:07,050
This is it right here.

758
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:22,090
That was passive aggressive.

759
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:31,619
Oh, I almost forgot to mention.

760
01:13:31,619 --> 01:13:33,539
That's me Frank again from Nvidia.

761
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:36,859
Hey, I almost forgot to mention.

762
01:13:36,859 --> 01:13:38,300
Hey, it's me again.

763
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:39,260
The YouTube guy.

764
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:41,260
This is your space.

765
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:42,619
We talked about your space.

766
01:13:42,619 --> 01:13:44,300
Well, better get out of the way.

767
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:46,140
I'm in front of your video right now.

768
01:13:46,779 --> 01:13:48,220
Hey, pause it though.

769
01:13:49,239 --> 01:13:51,479
This space right here is your fuck.

770
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:57,029
Hey, it's me again.

771
01:13:57,670 --> 01:14:01,189
The YouTube guy that's in the corner of your videos

772
01:14:01,189 --> 01:14:02,630
that comes up and gives you digital help.

773
01:14:04,899 --> 01:14:06,180
I better get out of your space.

774
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:10,439
Here we go.

775
01:14:10,439 --> 01:14:11,640
Now I'm here.

776
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:12,840
Fucking God damn it.

777
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:19,430
I have something very specific I want to say.

778
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:23,859
Hey, it's me.

779
01:14:23,859 --> 01:14:26,739
The YouTube paperclip guy from Microsoft.

780
01:14:26,739 --> 01:14:28,979
Except I'm another digital representation of hell.

781
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:32,420
Whoa, I'm in your space right now.

782
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:33,859
Whoopsie, I'm over here.

783
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:37,380
So if you want to monetize on YouTube,

784
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:38,979
click up there.

785
01:14:39,939 --> 01:14:41,460
That button over there.

786
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:42,979
That's going to bring down a drop down

787
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:45,140
to click on the monetize button.

788
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:46,180
Whoa, but be careful.

789
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:49,300
We pay demonetize your entire channel

790
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:50,819
because nobody works here.

791
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:53,779
We just kind of put bots up that catch random shit.

792
01:14:53,779 --> 01:14:55,619
And you might be caught in the crossfire.

793
01:14:55,619 --> 01:14:58,579
But this is your space right here.

794
01:14:58,579 --> 01:15:00,340
Oh, we've ruined entire channels

795
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:02,739
because we demonetized the entire channel.

796
01:15:02,739 --> 01:15:03,699
Don't worry about that.

797
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:08,340
This is what you need to be concerned with right here.

798
01:15:12,119 --> 01:15:13,319
I'll be going this way now.

799
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:26,760
So passive aggressive.

800
01:15:27,399 --> 01:15:36,260
That wasn't even part of the show.

801
01:15:48,199 --> 01:15:49,319
Oh, I got to do this one too.

802
01:15:52,899 --> 01:15:56,279
By the way, disclaimer.

803
01:15:56,279 --> 01:15:57,319
Hey, it's me again.

804
01:15:57,319 --> 01:16:00,649
Disclaimer, I am in no way a YouTube

805
01:16:00,649 --> 01:16:04,170
or any of its practices or its headquarters.

806
01:16:04,170 --> 01:16:06,329
I'm just your friendly neighborhood

807
01:16:06,329 --> 01:16:08,250
paperclip digital help guide guy.

808
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:10,060
There we go.

809
01:16:16,199 --> 01:16:17,159
See, there you go.

810
01:16:21,819 --> 01:16:22,779
Edit it out quick.

811
01:16:22,779 --> 01:16:24,380
See, you can't edit it out because I just said it.

812
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:29,590
Rerecord the audio.

813
01:16:33,529 --> 01:16:34,890
All right, I will mic a lot of these.

814
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:35,770
Don't worry.

815
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:41,319
We're blurry on the left side.

816
01:16:42,199 --> 01:16:55,750
Like over here.

817
01:16:56,310 --> 01:17:07,220
We're good.

818
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:07,720
All right.

819
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:14,920
All right, I got to.

820
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:16,119
Oh, this one's going to suck.

821
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:25,220
I have to fall and do this.

822
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:49,369
Do that right.

823
01:17:49,369 --> 01:17:50,729
That's bloating to it.

824
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:56,229
Now, whatever.

825
01:17:56,229 --> 01:17:58,010
That's not that high, right?

826
01:17:58,729 --> 01:18:00,090
It's not about that high up.

827
01:18:00,090 --> 01:18:03,909
I'm probably like 150,000 feet.

828
01:18:03,909 --> 01:18:05,590
That's not going to, it's going to, right?

829
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:07,699
Let's roll.

830
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:12,819
The ground is coming real fast.

831
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:24,300
Holy shit, it worked.

832
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:46,569
I feel fine.

833
01:18:46,569 --> 01:18:48,170
Side view is necessary.

834
01:18:58,180 --> 01:19:05,140
This is your space.

835
01:19:09,369 --> 01:19:10,970
Why do people do this?

836
01:19:10,970 --> 01:19:13,050
There's no reason to do what I'm doing, right?

837
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:14,489
If you were falling,

838
01:19:14,489 --> 01:19:16,010
you would be going like this.

839
01:19:16,970 --> 01:19:18,170
You would just be like.

840
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:27,960
Why do we, why, what is this?

841
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:31,369
This is like I'm an actor.

842
01:19:31,369 --> 01:19:32,789
Brain scrape, right?

843
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:42,340
My underwear.

844
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:44,100
Shit, it's all right.

845
01:19:51,899 --> 01:19:52,779
Okay, what's next?

846
01:20:00,310 --> 01:20:02,789
Something move.

847
01:20:02,789 --> 01:20:03,590
Okay, there we go.

848
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:04,710
This got like knocked over.

849
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:08,329
For some reason that got like tilted.

850
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:13,529
Don't ask me why, but it did.

851
01:20:14,729 --> 01:20:18,340
Weirdly enough, fall towards the camera.

852
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:26,329
I mean like, oh, I know what you mean.

853
01:20:26,329 --> 01:20:27,609
Like go into the camera.

854
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:33,340
Here we go again.

855
01:20:34,359 --> 01:20:36,760
Oh, no, no.

856
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:46,699
Why would I be looking at you?

857
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:50,020
Oh, shit.

858
01:20:54,460 --> 01:21:02,600
Was I doing my ABCs?

859
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:05,859
Why would you do that before you died?

860
01:21:11,029 --> 01:21:12,149
Follow you back to it.

861
01:21:12,149 --> 01:21:12,710
Take care.

862
01:21:12,710 --> 01:21:14,470
Okay, I gotta line this up.

863
01:21:25,939 --> 01:21:27,300
Look at my back sweat.

864
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:29,779
I got like fucking 4,000 pounds of lights on me.

865
01:21:58,220 --> 01:22:02,020
Okay, this one's gonna be good.

866
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:02,659
I like this one.

867
01:22:34,039 --> 01:22:35,479
I can't, I can't get up.

868
01:22:35,479 --> 01:22:37,239
I can't get up.

869
01:22:37,239 --> 01:22:40,329
I think it's fucking too heavy.

870
01:22:42,149 --> 01:22:53,189
If I go down, maybe though.

871
01:23:30,649 --> 01:24:00,699
Oh, what a day's work.

872
01:24:00,699 --> 01:24:01,979
Invest in a belt.

873
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:05,819
I had a lot of other things to think about

874
01:24:05,819 --> 01:24:07,180
than putting a belt on today.

875
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:11,619
It's all right, I'm about to get in pajamas anyways.

876
01:24:11,619 --> 01:24:15,670
All right, I might as well do this.

877
01:24:15,670 --> 01:24:23,050
This is like one of the most requested things

878
01:24:23,050 --> 01:24:24,010
that everyone wanted me to do.

879
01:24:24,010 --> 01:24:25,449
So I'm gonna get them like here.

880
01:24:25,449 --> 01:24:26,970
We'll start, we'll start here.

881
01:24:26,970 --> 01:24:32,460
Okay, so ready?

882
01:25:47,189 --> 01:25:56,630
No doubt.

883
01:26:03,819 --> 01:26:06,140
Huh?

884
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:07,140
What?

885
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:08,729
What?

886
01:26:08,729 --> 01:26:09,449
What?

887
01:26:09,449 --> 01:26:11,050
Oh, no, my magical powers.

888
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:14,180
Earth.

889
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:14,579
Earth.

890
01:26:15,319 --> 01:26:16,439
Earth is on fire.

891
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:23,340
What?

892
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:24,140
What?

893
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:24,380
No.

894
01:26:29,239 --> 01:26:30,279
I just shit my pants.

895
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:31,960
I can't do it anymore.

896
01:26:50,489 --> 01:26:51,369
Take the shirt off.

897
01:26:51,369 --> 01:26:53,289
I can't take the shirt off.

898
01:26:53,289 --> 01:26:59,539
Now I'm gonna do like various spells.

899
01:27:10,819 --> 01:27:11,939
Fucking God damn it.

900
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:53,539
What the fuck was that?

901
01:28:06,569 --> 01:28:09,289
Someone's gonna make me a Mugen character.

902
01:28:18,630 --> 01:28:19,750
Jesus Christ, okay.

903
01:28:21,829 --> 01:28:27,899
All right, we're almost done with the actions here.

904
01:28:27,899 --> 01:28:29,100
I don't know, I don't know about this one,

905
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:30,060
but this one would do.

906
01:28:30,060 --> 01:29:05,800
Just let that here, it's still good.

907
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:06,279
What?

908
01:29:06,279 --> 01:29:07,770
Really?

909
01:29:07,770 --> 01:29:08,250
No way.

910
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:22,390
No, that's all right.

911
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:22,710
Nice.

912
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:59,449
Wait, what happened?

913
01:29:59,449 --> 01:30:00,569
No, but we're still live.

914
01:30:00,569 --> 01:30:02,649
I dropped some frames.

915
01:30:02,649 --> 01:30:04,329
What was the last thing I did?

916
01:30:04,329 --> 01:30:10,920
Should still be good.

917
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:19,239
Okay, did you see the last thing I did?

918
01:30:19,239 --> 01:30:22,229
No, I dropped like 10 frames, that's fine.

919
01:30:22,229 --> 01:31:13,659
All right, so here's this one that people have been asking for.

920
01:31:13,659 --> 01:31:14,539
Fix the framing?

921
01:31:14,539 --> 01:31:19,100
No, what do you mean fix the framing?

922
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:25,350
It's gotta be cropped anyways.

923
01:31:25,350 --> 01:31:26,710
It has to be pulled back and forth.

924
01:31:26,710 --> 01:31:48,119
That's gonna stay there.

925
01:31:48,119 --> 01:31:57,460
Please dab?

926
01:31:57,460 --> 01:32:02,939
I vetoed dabbing, so I'm definitely not gonna dab.

927
01:32:02,939 --> 01:32:14,199
This needs to be like over here.

928
01:32:14,199 --> 01:32:25,029
Why is this doing this?

929
01:32:25,029 --> 01:32:25,750
Come on, man.

930
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:36,699
Give me a break.

931
01:32:36,699 --> 01:32:38,060
Give me a break.

932
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:58,439
Too small?

933
01:32:59,899 --> 01:33:01,180
I mean, I could move it forward.

934
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:05,909
Maybe that'll help a little up there.

935
01:33:05,909 --> 01:33:09,850
That should be good.

936
01:33:09,850 --> 01:33:10,649
That should be good.

937
01:33:12,979 --> 01:33:14,579
Yeah, that's good.

938
01:33:14,579 --> 01:33:15,989
All right, so what's next?

939
01:33:16,630 --> 01:33:25,270
It's on a slant.

940
01:33:25,270 --> 01:33:28,869
It just looks like that because this thing,

941
01:33:29,829 --> 01:33:31,979
it's actually really annoying actually.

942
01:33:31,979 --> 01:33:33,689
Hold on.

943
01:33:33,689 --> 01:33:35,529
Why the fuck is this doing this?

944
01:33:35,529 --> 01:33:38,939
I wish it wouldn't do that.

945
01:33:38,939 --> 01:33:43,800
Move the tripod a little.

946
01:33:49,210 --> 01:33:50,329
It's the tripod.

947
01:33:51,899 --> 01:33:52,699
I had it before.

948
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:57,720
This needs to come up a little bit like this.

949
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:04,359
How the fuck does that make any sense?

950
01:34:05,159 --> 01:34:20,060
It makes no sense because the tripod says it's level.

951
01:34:20,619 --> 01:34:22,520
I think maybe it's the way it's painted

952
01:34:23,159 --> 01:34:25,720
because it looks like it's a little bit of an edge

953
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:27,479
over here that goes a little further in

954
01:34:27,479 --> 01:34:28,119
or further out.

955
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:37,220
How's that?

956
01:34:47,369 --> 01:34:48,569
Yeah, I think it just looks like that

957
01:34:48,569 --> 01:34:50,329
because the way that the ground is over here.

958
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:54,220
All right, let's go.

959
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:08,569
Uh, so slowly peek into frame.

960
01:35:08,569 --> 01:35:09,289
How am I going to do this?

961
01:35:09,289 --> 01:35:10,649
This is going to be fucking hard.

962
01:35:10,649 --> 01:35:12,149
I'm going to get hurt doing this one,

963
01:35:12,149 --> 01:35:13,029
so I hope you're ready to see me

964
01:35:13,029 --> 01:35:14,390
get like actually fucking injured.

965
01:35:14,949 --> 01:35:46,279
Shut up.

966
01:35:54,710 --> 01:35:55,189
Belly.

967
01:35:56,789 --> 01:35:59,000
We saw his belly.

968
01:36:18,489 --> 01:36:24,729
I'm sorry that I have to do this.

969
01:37:01,270 --> 01:37:04,470
That was that was one of the most requested things.

970
01:37:04,470 --> 01:37:15,460
All right, act like I'm shaking hands with somebody.

971
01:37:17,770 --> 01:37:18,649
I don't know why.

972
01:37:18,649 --> 01:37:20,170
And then swimming.

973
01:37:20,170 --> 01:37:22,170
And then it's time to move on to the actual like breathing.

974
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:30,439
Good to see you, man.

975
01:37:30,439 --> 01:37:32,949
So that's a nice firm handshake.

976
01:37:33,510 --> 01:37:34,010
Okay.

977
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:37,479
You let go.

978
01:37:38,279 --> 01:37:38,840
Thanks, man.

979
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:40,039
That's a good handshake you got there.

980
01:37:43,210 --> 01:37:43,710
Hey.

981
01:37:44,329 --> 01:37:45,689
Hey, it's been so long.

982
01:37:45,689 --> 01:37:46,489
Hey, how are you?

983
01:37:46,489 --> 01:37:46,989
Come on.

984
01:37:49,239 --> 01:37:49,739
Yes.

985
01:37:50,359 --> 01:37:51,229
Good to see you.

986
01:37:54,439 --> 01:37:55,479
Put it there.

987
01:37:55,479 --> 01:37:55,979
That's it.

988
01:37:57,779 --> 01:38:02,090
No, it's good to see you, Mike.

989
01:38:08,039 --> 01:38:08,539
Hey.

990
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:11,079
Hey, put it there.

991
01:38:11,079 --> 01:38:12,279
All right, good to see you.

992
01:38:13,079 --> 01:38:28,170
I'll give these.

993
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:28,890
We'll do it from here.

994
01:38:32,939 --> 01:38:33,439
Hey.

995
01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:36,500
Yeah, I'd love to shake your hand.

996
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:37,619
Fuck yeah.

997
01:38:37,619 --> 01:38:38,979
Fuck yeah, man.

998
01:38:39,619 --> 01:38:41,539
So you still doing that thing?

999
01:38:41,539 --> 01:38:44,329
You still in school?

1000
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:46,939
You know, let's do the other one too.

1001
01:38:46,939 --> 01:38:58,500
All right.

1002
01:38:58,500 --> 01:38:59,000
Hey.

1003
01:38:59,699 --> 01:39:02,979
Hey, it's Tim.

1004
01:39:02,979 --> 01:39:03,859
Oh, my God.

1005
01:39:03,859 --> 01:39:04,659
It's good to see you.

1006
01:39:04,659 --> 01:39:05,300
Thanks, man.

1007
01:39:05,859 --> 01:39:07,140
Yeah, it's great to see you again.

1008
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:16,720
Tim?

1009
01:39:17,779 --> 01:39:19,140
Tim Davidson.

1010
01:39:19,779 --> 01:39:20,279
What?

1011
01:39:20,439 --> 01:39:21,079
Hey, man.

1012
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:23,100
How are you?

1013
01:39:25,130 --> 01:39:25,770
No shit.

1014
01:39:26,970 --> 01:39:28,010
I got two of my own.

1015
01:39:29,949 --> 01:39:30,510
What's this?

1016
01:39:31,149 --> 01:39:32,029
That's just my new car.

1017
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:34,430
It's beauty, isn't she?

1018
01:39:36,430 --> 01:39:37,550
I souped her up too.

1019
01:39:38,750 --> 01:39:39,470
V6 engine.

1020
01:39:40,350 --> 01:39:42,159
What do you got back there?

1021
01:39:43,039 --> 01:39:50,119
Not as good as mine, but still worth having in your garage.

1022
01:39:50,119 --> 01:39:51,470
Anyway, it's great.

1023
01:39:51,470 --> 01:39:52,909
That's great that you're doing so well.

1024
01:39:53,869 --> 01:39:55,949
Yeah, I know you gotta go.

1025
01:39:55,949 --> 01:39:57,069
I just caught you.

1026
01:39:57,869 --> 01:39:58,670
Let me get back.

1027
01:39:58,670 --> 01:40:00,590
Let me get into this little thing over here.

1028
01:40:00,590 --> 01:40:01,069
You know what I mean?

1029
01:40:01,789 --> 01:40:02,909
Good to see you again.

1030
01:40:02,909 --> 01:40:03,409
Yeah.

1031
01:40:03,949 --> 01:40:05,819
Take care of yourself, Tim.

1032
01:40:05,819 --> 01:40:19,000
See you later, man.

1033
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:34,720
I do have a wheel.

1034
01:40:41,079 --> 01:40:42,039
It's a horse.

1035
01:40:50,510 --> 01:40:52,590
There's some serious hydraulics in that car.

1036
01:41:03,609 --> 01:41:04,739
Oh!

1037
01:41:07,710 --> 01:41:10,460
What the fuck?

1038
01:41:10,460 --> 01:41:10,960
Okay.

1039
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:32,159
That was me getting on a horse.

1040
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:34,079
I was me on a horse.

1041
01:41:34,079 --> 01:41:35,119
I was on a horse.

1042
01:41:35,119 --> 01:41:36,239
That's a horse.

1043
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:38,000
That's me on a horse, and that's the thing that you hold.

1044
01:41:45,949 --> 01:41:46,909
Delete the stream.

1045
01:41:46,909 --> 01:41:48,270
Delete the whole stream.

1046
01:41:48,270 --> 01:41:49,069
Delete the stream.

1047
01:41:49,069 --> 01:41:49,789
Delete the stream.

1048
01:41:50,649 --> 01:41:51,289
Delete's over.

1049
01:41:52,090 --> 01:41:53,050
Delete it.

1050
01:41:53,050 --> 01:41:54,409
Delete the stream.

1051
01:41:59,229 --> 01:42:02,020
Delete.

1052
01:42:02,479 --> 01:42:02,979
Don't.

1053
01:42:04,119 --> 01:42:04,619
Nobody.

1054
01:42:18,939 --> 01:42:19,439
Idiots.

1055
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:24,619
Nobody use that.

1056
01:42:24,619 --> 01:42:25,579
Nobody use that.

1057
01:42:26,399 --> 01:42:27,520
You'll be in big trouble.

1058
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:47,079
What an old joke.

1059
01:42:47,720 --> 01:42:49,149
Puppet stream.

1060
01:42:50,239 --> 01:42:51,520
I don't even have a sock on.

1061
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:53,039
Well, I just, whatever.

1062
01:42:53,039 --> 01:42:54,399
All right, we're almost done with the actions.

1063
01:42:55,899 --> 01:42:57,260
I have to swim now.

1064
01:42:57,260 --> 01:43:01,319
Can't you just, like, fuck, can't you just do swimming and...

1065
01:43:01,319 --> 01:43:04,119
Can't swimming and flying be the same thing?

1066
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:07,000
Well, I guess I was fucking screaming, so that doesn't work.

1067
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:17,359
This is, this is flying.

1068
01:43:17,359 --> 01:43:18,479
I'm just flying again.

1069
01:44:02,590 --> 01:44:10,430
I trust you.

1070
01:44:10,430 --> 01:44:11,479
How was that?

1071
01:44:21,069 --> 01:44:22,189
He can't swim.

1072
01:44:23,149 --> 01:44:24,670
How does he not know how to swim?

1073
01:44:24,670 --> 01:44:26,109
Just wait, wait, hold on.

1074
01:44:26,109 --> 01:44:28,909
There's more to that.

1075
01:44:38,520 --> 01:45:02,970
That was swimming.

1076
01:45:02,970 --> 01:45:04,090
I'm done with swimming.

1077
01:45:04,090 --> 01:45:04,970
Swimming's done.

1078
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:15,079
He says, this is a huge great screen.

1079
01:45:19,119 --> 01:45:20,960
Contemplating life choices.

1080
01:45:26,189 --> 01:45:27,470
All right, here we go.

1081
01:45:27,470 --> 01:45:35,659
So here's where we're going to do some reactions.

1082
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:40,140
We're like just about, we're pretty much more than halfway done.

1083
01:45:40,140 --> 01:45:42,300
Well, actually, there's a lot of, oh my God, there's so much shit.

1084
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:48,479
We're like 30, 40% of the way done.

1085
01:45:49,609 --> 01:45:50,569
All right, here we go.

1086
01:45:51,210 --> 01:45:55,560
This is what, this is what you waited for.

1087
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:56,920
So we got all the actions out of the way.

1088
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:57,479
Now, here we go.

1089
01:45:57,479 --> 01:45:58,279
This is what you wanted.

1090
01:45:58,279 --> 01:46:10,119
Now, this is by far, this is the best part right here.

1091
01:46:10,119 --> 01:46:11,239
This is my favorite part.

1092
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:13,369
This is the best part.

1093
01:46:14,909 --> 01:46:15,310
Stop talking.

1094
01:46:15,310 --> 01:46:15,949
This is the best part.

1095
01:46:17,979 --> 01:46:18,300
Nice.

1096
01:46:26,939 --> 01:46:27,739
This is terrible.

1097
01:46:30,090 --> 01:46:31,449
Absolutely terrible.

1098
01:46:33,149 --> 01:46:34,350
Nothing about this is good.

1099
01:46:34,989 --> 01:46:35,789
Not one thing.

1100
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:39,520
God, I hate this.

1101
01:46:40,750 --> 01:46:41,630
I hate this.

1102
01:46:41,630 --> 01:46:42,430
This is terrible.

1103
01:46:43,069 --> 01:46:49,659
What a gamer.

1104
01:46:51,739 --> 01:46:53,340
What a god of a gamer.

1105
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:53,819
Seriously.

1106
01:47:07,529 --> 01:47:09,210
This is the thing I'm talking about right here.

1107
01:47:09,850 --> 01:47:11,050
I've told you guys this before.

1108
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:14,079
Absolute perfection.

1109
01:47:15,390 --> 01:47:16,590
No ifs, ands, or buts.

1110
01:47:17,550 --> 01:47:21,470
This right here is absolute perfection.

1111
01:47:35,390 --> 01:47:36,189
What a gamer.

1112
01:47:37,229 --> 01:47:37,869
Hold on, hold on.

1113
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:50,460
Wow, wow.

1114
01:47:51,100 --> 01:47:53,449
This is what it looks like up close.

1115
01:47:55,319 --> 01:47:58,199
From back there, it could have been anything.

1116
01:47:59,239 --> 01:48:00,359
This is perfect.

1117
01:48:00,359 --> 01:48:02,359
It's exactly what I was talking about.

1118
01:48:02,359 --> 01:48:13,949
Turn it up.

1119
01:48:13,949 --> 01:48:14,989
Are you in charge of this?

1120
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:16,279
Turn it up.

1121
01:48:17,640 --> 01:48:18,439
Get to shut this off.

1122
01:48:18,439 --> 01:48:19,640
Shut them all off.

1123
01:48:19,640 --> 01:48:21,079
Turn your lights in your house off too.

1124
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:35,039
You really fucking watching this shit?

1125
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:41,359
Oh, please.

1126
01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:44,409
Oh my god.

1127
01:48:45,369 --> 01:48:48,439
Fucking god.

1128
01:48:48,439 --> 01:48:48,939
Terrible.

1129
01:48:58,109 --> 01:48:58,609
Yeah.

1130
01:49:00,319 --> 01:49:00,819
Yes.

1131
01:49:01,199 --> 01:49:04,760
That's it.

1132
01:49:25,399 --> 01:49:26,279
Okay, so.

1133
01:49:27,479 --> 01:49:35,930
Hold on, I'm going to do this one.

1134
01:49:35,930 --> 01:49:36,569
Whoa.

1135
01:49:36,569 --> 01:49:45,500
So this is the virtual world of the world.

1136
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:46,000
Cut.

1137
01:49:46,939 --> 01:49:59,130
So this is the virtual world.

1138
01:49:59,130 --> 01:50:00,170
Why can't I say that?

1139
01:50:03,930 --> 01:50:05,130
Virtual world.

1140
01:50:05,130 --> 01:50:06,170
Virtual world.

1141
01:50:12,170 --> 01:50:12,890
Whoa.

1142
01:50:12,890 --> 01:50:20,670
So this is the virtual world.

1143
01:50:20,670 --> 01:50:24,039
It's amazing.

1144
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:32,140
Fascinating.

1145
01:50:43,819 --> 01:50:50,300
All right.

1146
01:50:50,300 --> 01:50:53,020
Now how am I going to do this?

1147
01:50:53,020 --> 01:50:56,430
I have to get like shot at.

1148
01:51:01,210 --> 01:51:01,689
Time.

1149
01:51:01,689 --> 01:51:02,010
Close.

1150
01:51:02,569 --> 01:51:06,840
I want to keep the actions in the same close though

1151
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:09,560
because if people are going to be cutting between stuff

1152
01:51:10,199 --> 01:51:12,520
then they kind of need continuity.

1153
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:14,840
So let me get through like the most of the actions.

1154
01:51:34,189 --> 01:51:37,500
You got me.

1155
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:38,060
You got me.

1156
01:51:40,779 --> 01:51:41,279
You got me.

1157
01:51:54,329 --> 01:51:55,529
You got me.

1158
01:51:55,529 --> 01:51:56,250
You got me.

1159
01:52:07,609 --> 01:52:12,000
You got me.

1160
01:52:13,689 --> 01:52:15,449
All right, I'm not doing you got me anymore.

1161
01:52:23,550 --> 01:52:35,579
What am I?

1162
01:52:35,579 --> 01:52:35,979
What?

1163
01:52:35,979 --> 01:52:36,699
What a way to die.

1164
01:52:44,510 --> 01:52:52,300
Am I giving birth?

1165
01:53:08,460 --> 01:53:32,699
I have to make the noise, man.

1166
01:53:32,699 --> 01:53:34,060
All right, here we go.

1167
01:53:34,060 --> 01:53:35,979
It's almost time to bring out the props.

1168
01:53:35,979 --> 01:53:41,289
All right, so here we go.

1169
01:53:42,250 --> 01:53:43,689
Hold on, give me one second.

1170
01:53:52,680 --> 01:54:01,500
Camera's too high.

1171
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:04,300
All right, so where is...

1172
01:54:07,119 --> 01:54:16,189
I don't know why this looks so off.

1173
01:54:16,189 --> 01:54:19,659
Sorry, I just minimized my action list here.

1174
01:54:19,659 --> 01:54:27,850
Okay, so now I need to frantically run around

1175
01:54:27,850 --> 01:54:29,289
as if the building is on fire.

1176
01:54:38,159 --> 01:54:38,640
Oh no.

1177
01:54:39,279 --> 01:54:40,399
Oh no.

1178
01:54:40,399 --> 01:54:42,600
No, no, no, no.

1179
01:54:44,329 --> 01:54:47,630
Oh, oh, it's everywhere.

1180
01:54:52,090 --> 01:55:01,609
Let me fix this shit.

1181
01:55:01,609 --> 01:55:22,560
This next one is sleep and be startled by something.

1182
01:55:50,439 --> 01:56:07,579
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm up.

1183
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:25,880
Five more minutes.

1184
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:28,279
Okay, I'll do it five more minutes.

1185
01:56:28,279 --> 01:56:30,439
Why am I making like jeans and...

1186
01:56:30,439 --> 01:56:31,800
I gotta go like that pajamas.

1187
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:32,279
Hold on.

1188
01:56:32,279 --> 01:56:38,119
Wait, wait, wait.

1189
01:56:38,119 --> 01:56:39,000
Costume change.

1190
01:56:39,720 --> 01:57:17,420
My starboard is pajamas.

1191
01:57:38,890 --> 01:57:42,380
No, no, you do it.

1192
01:57:43,819 --> 01:57:44,539
You do it.

1193
01:57:47,210 --> 01:57:48,010
I'm sleeping.

1194
01:57:54,199 --> 01:57:55,000
Yeah.

1195
01:57:55,000 --> 01:58:18,319
Okay, mom.

1196
01:58:18,319 --> 01:58:19,439
Five more minutes, mom.

1197
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:32,960
Mom!

1198
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:34,000
Hey, mom.

1199
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:42,380
Can I have a glass of water?

1200
01:58:42,380 --> 01:58:43,020
No!

1201
01:58:45,449 --> 01:58:46,569
I'm getting the fuck off.

1202
01:58:46,569 --> 01:58:54,140
I have like a fucking tantrum.

1203
01:58:54,140 --> 01:58:57,100
I'm not having a tantrum on the ground over there at 33.

1204
01:58:57,100 --> 01:59:05,359
Ow!

1205
01:59:05,359 --> 01:59:13,479
No, did I just fuck this up?

1206
01:59:13,479 --> 01:59:17,789
No, we're good.

1207
01:59:17,789 --> 01:59:18,909
No, we're good.

1208
01:59:18,909 --> 01:59:25,149
All right, so now I need my phone back.

1209
01:59:25,149 --> 01:59:26,029
Where the fuck is that?

1210
01:59:26,029 --> 01:59:28,779
Right here.

1211
01:59:28,779 --> 01:59:30,300
I have like a fucking tantrum.

1212
01:59:36,109 --> 01:59:39,640
Uh, so now we're gonna deal with the weather in my pajamas.

1213
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:50,750
Okay, here we go.

1214
01:59:50,750 --> 01:59:52,350
Like outside with like no shoes on.

1215
01:59:52,350 --> 02:00:32,000
Let's get close.

1216
02:00:32,000 --> 02:01:05,560
All right, here we go.

1217
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:06,680
Fighting game moves?

1218
02:01:06,680 --> 02:01:12,329
Don't worry, I'm gonna do it.

1219
02:01:12,329 --> 02:01:13,130
Brain.

1220
02:01:13,130 --> 02:01:29,470
Why would you put your hands up?

1221
02:01:30,199 --> 02:01:37,930
Out of the brain in your pajamas.

1222
02:01:37,930 --> 02:01:42,329
All right, so now I got this one.

1223
02:01:42,329 --> 02:02:01,319
If I don't move, it won't see me.

1224
02:02:01,319 --> 02:02:17,279
Costume change.

1225
02:02:19,579 --> 02:02:21,180
Still in PJs.

1226
02:02:21,180 --> 02:02:29,050
Oh, this one's gonna be good.

1227
02:02:29,050 --> 02:02:33,949
This one's gonna be good.

1228
02:02:33,949 --> 02:02:56,619
God damn it.

1229
02:02:56,619 --> 02:02:59,529
Transitioning into...

1230
02:03:04,539 --> 02:03:06,520
Oh, shit.

1231
02:03:14,279 --> 02:03:15,880
Stinging my blood.

1232
02:03:17,319 --> 02:03:24,810
Honey detected.

1233
02:03:25,449 --> 02:03:32,159
Nice costume change.

1234
02:03:32,159 --> 02:03:33,680
I walked off the green screen.

1235
02:03:33,680 --> 02:03:34,399
Fuck.

1236
02:03:34,399 --> 02:03:37,949
All right, you ready?

1237
02:03:37,949 --> 02:03:42,250
Are you ready for me to do prop-related material?

1238
02:03:42,250 --> 02:03:52,439
Here we go.

1239
02:04:08,649 --> 02:04:10,489
I'm gonna look like such a fucking idiot.

1240
02:04:10,489 --> 02:04:12,569
I have three pairs of pants on.

1241
02:04:12,649 --> 02:04:17,470
I have literally three...

1242
02:04:17,470 --> 02:04:20,590
I have jeans, pajamas, and now suit pants on.

1243
02:04:20,590 --> 02:04:21,069
Hope of that.

1244
02:04:28,699 --> 02:04:30,699
I'm gonna look like such a drunk.

1245
02:04:31,340 --> 02:04:33,260
Like my tie's gonna be undone.

1246
02:04:33,260 --> 02:04:34,779
I'm gonna be like a drunk guy at a wedding.

1247
02:04:35,500 --> 02:05:02,720
With like socks.

1248
02:05:05,659 --> 02:05:08,460
Just imagine I just like, I drank like fucking a pint of vodka.

1249
02:05:09,180 --> 02:05:14,890
I don't fucking care about this tie.

1250
02:05:19,399 --> 02:05:20,600
I got a t-shirt on.

1251
02:05:55,369 --> 02:05:56,329
All right.

1252
02:05:56,329 --> 02:05:57,529
Looking good.

1253
02:06:01,100 --> 02:06:02,460
Chip's got a fucking clip on.

1254
02:06:47,319 --> 02:06:55,449
I gotta keep it like that though.

1255
02:06:55,449 --> 02:06:56,810
That's so fucking funny.

1256
02:06:58,430 --> 02:06:59,390
Is either of these zipped up?

1257
02:07:13,739 --> 02:07:14,779
That's right, Diane.

1258
02:07:14,779 --> 02:07:22,220
As you can tell, there's a cold front coming down through California here over Mississippi.

1259
02:07:22,220 --> 02:07:27,180
That's gonna be about 45 degrees cooler than you typically would have out there in the Midwest.

1260
02:07:28,220 --> 02:07:29,420
Put the next slide up, please.

1261
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:35,880
That's correct, Diane.

1262
02:07:35,880 --> 02:07:40,199
So as you see here, Massachusetts has got a little bit of a hot front coming in.

1263
02:07:40,199 --> 02:07:42,810
Pretty easy what you're looking at here.

1264
02:07:42,810 --> 02:07:44,890
Halloween weekend's gonna be a little bit tough for you there.

1265
02:07:44,890 --> 02:07:45,689
Make sure you bundle up.

1266
02:07:45,689 --> 02:07:48,810
Make sure you get a lot of hats on.

1267
02:07:48,810 --> 02:07:52,170
So next weekend, we've got two, that's right, two...

1268
02:07:56,920 --> 02:07:58,039
Oh my, did the stream die?

1269
02:07:58,600 --> 02:08:01,760
Are we good?

1270
02:08:06,939 --> 02:08:07,899
Are we still fine?

1271
02:08:19,159 --> 02:08:23,210
Good.

1272
02:08:23,210 --> 02:08:24,090
That's right, Diane.

1273
02:08:24,090 --> 02:08:25,930
It's gonna be a cold one this weekend.

1274
02:08:25,930 --> 02:08:29,850
As you can see here, we've got some low pressure coming up through the mountains here,

1275
02:08:29,850 --> 02:08:33,369
going all the way down over southern New Hampshire.

1276
02:08:33,369 --> 02:08:38,329
That's right, it's gonna make its way down here across the Nile River there.

1277
02:08:38,329 --> 02:08:42,090
And then it's gonna wrap back around and come back towards Massachusetts,

1278
02:08:42,090 --> 02:08:47,770
which then, unfortunately, your Saturday football game's gonna get potentially rained out.

1279
02:08:47,770 --> 02:08:53,770
As you see, two, that's right, two cold fronts coming from here and from here.

1280
02:08:54,489 --> 02:08:56,170
And it's gonna be a breezy one.

1281
02:08:56,170 --> 02:08:59,529
They're gonna collide together and they may be a gosh darn tornado.

1282
02:08:59,529 --> 02:09:03,210
So you better bundle up out there and make sure you have anti-tornado clothing on

1283
02:09:03,210 --> 02:09:06,090
and anti-tornado hats because they might blow away.

1284
02:09:06,090 --> 02:09:06,590
Diane?

1285
02:09:11,560 --> 02:09:12,920
I'm not so sure about that one.

1286
02:09:12,920 --> 02:09:14,600
It's gonna be a hot one, that's right.

1287
02:09:15,399 --> 02:09:17,079
It's gonna be a hot one out there, Diane.

1288
02:09:17,079 --> 02:09:18,920
As you can see, look at how big that sun is.

1289
02:09:19,640 --> 02:09:21,000
Look at how big that is.

1290
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:22,840
I don't even need to tell you temperature numbers.

1291
02:09:22,840 --> 02:09:24,760
That's just a big old sun, ain't it there?

1292
02:09:25,399 --> 02:09:29,239
And it's gonna be shining across the entire U.S. of A, that's right.

1293
02:09:29,239 --> 02:09:33,000
Sun here, sunshine over here, and even sunshine down here,

1294
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:36,039
where you don't typically get it, if you know what I'm saying.

1295
02:09:36,039 --> 02:09:37,720
So, bundle up out there.

1296
02:09:37,720 --> 02:09:38,600
It's gonna be a cold one.

1297
02:09:38,600 --> 02:09:40,359
Every day's a cold one with the sun out there.

1298
02:09:42,119 --> 02:09:43,399
And Diane, go fuck yourself!

1299
02:09:51,079 --> 02:09:51,579
Wow!

1300
02:09:59,869 --> 02:10:05,710
You know, typically I bring you the weather on a daily basis at 6 a.m.,

1301
02:10:05,710 --> 02:10:08,909
6 a.m. in the morning with Diane, Carol, and Rick.

1302
02:10:10,590 --> 02:10:12,590
But today, I want to show you something different.

1303
02:10:13,550 --> 02:10:16,270
Besides the fact that, first, be aware,

1304
02:10:16,909 --> 02:10:20,109
we are gonna have some snow over here in the Colorado Rockies,

1305
02:10:20,670 --> 02:10:24,590
coming through here, down into the southern part of Colorado.

1306
02:10:24,590 --> 02:10:26,109
But, forget that.

1307
02:10:26,670 --> 02:10:29,550
I want to show you something that I care about.

1308
02:10:29,550 --> 02:10:31,310
Something that I want to show.

1309
02:10:31,310 --> 02:10:33,949
That I haven't been having, I had no opportunity to do it until now.

1310
02:10:34,829 --> 02:10:39,710
That's me on my fishing trip.

1311
02:10:39,710 --> 02:10:41,720
That's me and my son.

1312
02:10:42,359 --> 02:10:47,260
I just wanted to show.

1313
02:10:51,369 --> 02:10:52,250
There we are.

1314
02:10:52,250 --> 02:10:54,649
And back to the weather.

1315
02:10:55,689 --> 02:10:59,899
We do have, like I said, some cold from who cares about this.

1316
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:04,560
America, go out and live your lives.

1317
02:11:05,359 --> 02:11:06,880
Don't worry about the weather.

1318
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:08,800
You just go outside and sniff.

1319
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:09,760
You'll be just fine.

1320
02:11:10,479 --> 02:11:11,840
It's gonna be cold some days.

1321
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:13,119
It's gonna be hot some days.

1322
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:16,079
It's just, just go out there.

1323
02:11:16,079 --> 02:11:18,239
Go out there and live.

1324
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:35,680
Diane, why is the tie three-fourths the size?

1325
02:11:35,680 --> 02:11:37,359
All right, so now, here's another one.

1326
02:11:37,359 --> 02:11:39,439
I have to get the tie off for this one.

1327
02:11:40,079 --> 02:11:41,229
Here's the last one.

1328
02:11:41,229 --> 02:11:42,109
We'll do one more weather.

1329
02:11:50,970 --> 02:11:52,489
Hey, it's me.

1330
02:11:52,489 --> 02:11:53,529
That's right, Diane.

1331
02:11:53,529 --> 02:11:56,439
We got the wacky weather report coming up.

1332
02:11:56,439 --> 02:11:57,079
That was my note.

1333
02:11:57,079 --> 02:12:00,399
So as you see here, it's gonna be, wow,

1334
02:12:00,399 --> 02:12:02,319
it's gonna be breezy tomorrow night.

1335
02:12:02,319 --> 02:12:04,640
So make sure you stay indoors.

1336
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:06,000
60 mile per hour gusts.

1337
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,279
Be careful out there.

1338
02:12:07,279 --> 02:12:08,800
Whoa, easy.

1339
02:12:09,359 --> 02:12:12,159
Next up, oh, of course, gotta tell you,

1340
02:12:12,159 --> 02:12:15,119
the local pumpkin festival is gonna be canceled

1341
02:12:15,119 --> 02:12:18,479
because, oh no, it's raining outside.

1342
02:12:20,640 --> 02:12:21,600
Back to you, Diane.

1343
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:32,560
Diane, will you marry me?

1344
02:12:44,399 --> 02:12:46,159
That was just Jim Carrey.

1345
02:12:52,670 --> 02:12:53,470
He looks like he wears...

1346
02:13:00,510 --> 02:13:01,149
That's right.

1347
02:13:01,869 --> 02:13:02,750
Here's the weather.

1348
02:13:05,880 --> 02:13:10,720
Yeah, the roads are gonna be slick.

1349
02:13:13,979 --> 02:13:17,899
Especially on that road there, that one over here.

1350
02:13:21,020 --> 02:13:23,819
I think this is gonna be at least two or three.

1351
02:13:24,989 --> 02:13:26,729
I don't know.

1352
02:13:26,729 --> 02:13:27,289
Just look.

1353
02:13:27,289 --> 02:13:30,359
This is, I think, two or three different weathers

1354
02:13:30,359 --> 02:13:31,239
that are gonna come together

1355
02:13:31,239 --> 02:13:34,279
and find a dual weather scenario.

1356
02:13:35,239 --> 02:13:38,960
No, I don't care.

1357
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:40,960
Just job.

1358
02:13:42,010 --> 02:13:44,010
I went out last night and I got destroyed.

1359
02:14:08,720 --> 02:14:09,359
All right, here we go.

1360
02:14:11,640 --> 02:14:13,159
Now I have to accept an award.

1361
02:14:16,319 --> 02:14:35,529
No tie for this one.

1362
02:14:35,529 --> 02:14:36,329
Nice.

1363
02:14:36,409 --> 02:14:38,649
Right, thank you.

1364
02:14:39,369 --> 02:14:52,800
Well, thanks everybody.

1365
02:14:53,600 --> 02:14:59,869
I just wanna say, being the number one streamer on Twitch,

1366
02:15:00,840 --> 02:15:02,920
it was a dream come true.

1367
02:15:02,920 --> 02:15:04,039
No, I never thought I would be here.

1368
02:15:04,039 --> 02:15:06,680
I never thought I would get to the stage in my life

1369
02:15:06,680 --> 02:15:08,199
where I was the number one most viewed,

1370
02:15:08,199 --> 02:15:10,279
number one most subscribed, number one most watched.

1371
02:15:11,159 --> 02:15:12,520
We're bigger than ESPN now.

1372
02:15:12,520 --> 02:15:14,920
So, I mean, right, yep.

1373
02:15:15,880 --> 02:15:16,439
That's a fan.

1374
02:15:16,439 --> 02:15:17,479
That's a fan up there, guys.

1375
02:15:20,670 --> 02:15:22,510
So, it's ridiculous that now

1376
02:15:23,069 --> 02:15:24,350
I'm able to buy Disney,

1377
02:15:25,149 --> 02:15:26,909
which I never thought I'd be able to do.

1378
02:15:26,909 --> 02:15:29,069
I swear to God, I'm gonna make the incredible stream.

1379
02:15:29,069 --> 02:15:29,310
Yep.

1380
02:15:30,109 --> 02:15:32,590
So, thank you everybody so much for all that you've done.

1381
02:15:33,470 --> 02:15:33,710
Yep.

1382
02:15:34,350 --> 02:15:34,989
We made it.

1383
02:15:34,989 --> 02:15:35,390
We did it.

1384
02:15:36,840 --> 02:15:39,949
Well, oh, I did.

1385
02:15:42,270 --> 02:15:42,670
I did.

1386
02:15:43,609 --> 02:15:44,729
But, yeah.

1387
02:15:45,369 --> 02:15:46,329
Yeah, thank you.

1388
02:15:47,659 --> 02:15:51,579
I'll see you all, hey, Tuesdays and Thursdays and Fridays.

1389
02:15:51,579 --> 02:15:53,319
What's that?

1390
02:15:55,739 --> 02:15:58,649
Yeah, okay.

1391
02:15:59,420 --> 02:16:04,760
No, yeah, well, I'm not gonna play Minecraft.

1392
02:16:04,760 --> 02:16:06,039
Thanks for the enthusiasm.

1393
02:16:07,239 --> 02:16:10,199
I will see you guys real soon, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday.

1394
02:16:10,199 --> 02:16:10,840
Much love to you.

1395
02:16:10,840 --> 02:16:11,880
Thank you for this award.

1396
02:16:11,880 --> 02:16:12,600
Thank you for this.

1397
02:16:13,960 --> 02:16:14,920
You guys are amazing.

1398
02:16:14,920 --> 02:16:15,319
Thank you.

1399
02:16:17,720 --> 02:16:30,539
All right, one more of these.

1400
02:16:42,569 --> 02:16:42,969
Got it.

1401
02:16:43,530 --> 02:16:43,850
Yes.

1402
02:16:46,219 --> 02:16:48,540
All right.

1403
02:16:48,540 --> 02:16:48,940
Wow.

1404
02:16:50,639 --> 02:16:50,959
Whoa.

1405
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:54,399
I never thought that I would be winning this award.

1406
02:16:55,549 --> 02:16:57,280
Unbelievable.

1407
02:16:57,280 --> 02:16:58,000
Let me just say,

1408
02:16:58,719 --> 02:17:03,440
from the bottom of my heart, thank you for all of your support

1409
02:17:04,239 --> 02:17:06,879
and for all of your wonderful contributions.

1410
02:17:08,120 --> 02:17:10,680
I must say, it's been quite a year.

1411
02:17:12,459 --> 02:17:16,540
Quite a year, in fact, that I've got two more games to announce.

1412
02:17:17,340 --> 02:17:17,899
That's right.

1413
02:17:18,780 --> 02:17:19,659
Two more games.

1414
02:17:20,940 --> 02:17:25,659
With the most ingenuity and the highest caliber of skill

1415
02:17:25,659 --> 02:17:28,799
that any of our developers have ever done,

1416
02:17:28,879 --> 02:17:33,360
it is my pleasure to announce our latest title.

1417
02:17:44,969 --> 02:17:50,680
Never before has there ever been quite a scenario like this one.

1418
02:17:53,309 --> 02:17:56,889
Diablo Immortal is nothing to do with me.

1419
02:17:57,450 --> 02:18:03,079
I'm not gonna make a Blizzard reference because I have nothing to do.

1420
02:18:03,079 --> 02:18:04,360
I have a different game to show you.

1421
02:18:04,920 --> 02:18:05,979
Here it is.

1422
02:18:08,489 --> 02:18:09,770
I can't go down that road.

1423
02:18:10,569 --> 02:18:19,389
That's right.

1424
02:18:20,729 --> 02:18:21,229
Hey.

1425
02:18:22,409 --> 02:18:22,909
Hey.

1426
02:18:23,530 --> 02:18:25,479
Are there any gamers in here?

1427
02:18:27,149 --> 02:18:27,649
Of course there is.

1428
02:18:30,700 --> 02:18:32,139
Got quite a lineup this year.

1429
02:18:33,360 --> 02:18:38,639
Last year we saw some of the best games highly reviewed

1430
02:18:38,639 --> 02:18:41,709
that we've ever had as a company here.

1431
02:18:41,709 --> 02:18:42,670
We have you all to thank.

1432
02:18:44,440 --> 02:18:49,159
Our average Metacritic score reached over 58.

1433
02:18:53,879 --> 02:19:00,120
And I find it completely necessary to now show you, the fans,

1434
02:19:01,159 --> 02:19:05,319
a brand new experience that you won't have anywhere else.

1435
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:11,280
We're talking about complete open world, complete open environment,

1436
02:19:12,159 --> 02:19:15,040
and complete and total control over your surroundings.

1437
02:19:17,600 --> 02:19:18,100
Yeah.

1438
02:19:18,940 --> 02:19:19,899
You knew it was coming.

1439
02:19:21,079 --> 02:19:22,360
But were you ready for this?

1440
02:19:23,770 --> 02:19:28,329
I present to you, made with me and my wife and our three kids,

1441
02:19:32,680 --> 02:19:33,399
World Zone.

1442
02:19:42,329 --> 02:19:42,809
There we go.

1443
02:19:42,809 --> 02:19:43,309
Okay.

1444
02:19:44,829 --> 02:19:56,829
World Zone is a PVP-inspired top-down FPS hyphen strategy game.

1445
02:19:59,229 --> 02:20:00,590
Here's some gameplay footage of it now.

1446
02:20:04,270 --> 02:20:10,190
You'll get this in your hands as soon as Monday.

1447
02:20:11,149 --> 02:20:11,790
Monday.

1448
02:20:11,790 --> 02:20:13,549
Like I'm talking about tomorrow.

1449
02:20:13,549 --> 02:20:14,350
You understand?

1450
02:20:14,350 --> 02:20:15,790
You're going to get this game on Monday.

1451
02:20:16,959 --> 02:20:17,840
Monday.

1452
02:20:17,840 --> 02:20:18,479
Monday.

1453
02:20:18,479 --> 02:20:18,959
Monday.

1454
02:20:18,959 --> 02:20:20,959
You're going to get this game on Monday.

1455
02:20:25,420 --> 02:20:26,219
This Monday.

1456
02:20:26,940 --> 02:20:29,409
And that's my time.

1457
02:20:30,209 --> 02:20:31,329
Get your hands on it Monday.

1458
02:20:31,969 --> 02:20:34,239
Have a great rest of your conference.

1459
02:20:44,209 --> 02:20:45,729
Tell them about the shoes.

1460
02:21:04,299 --> 02:21:04,799
Whatever.

1461
02:21:09,360 --> 02:21:11,360
No, I'm not redoing it with shoes on.

1462
02:21:15,760 --> 02:21:16,260
All right.

1463
02:21:22,819 --> 02:21:24,260
Now I'm going to bring in a couple of props.

1464
02:21:24,819 --> 02:21:29,790
This is a baseball.

1465
02:21:31,489 --> 02:21:33,170
I'm soxing this one too.

1466
02:22:18,129 --> 02:22:29,309
There it goes.

1467
02:22:29,309 --> 02:22:30,590
Here's what I have to say about this.

1468
02:22:32,030 --> 02:22:32,909
See this bullshit?

1469
02:22:33,469 --> 02:22:44,639
Get out of here.

1470
02:22:44,639 --> 02:22:46,700
No, no, no, no.

1471
02:22:46,700 --> 02:22:47,500
Turn it up.

1472
02:22:47,500 --> 02:22:48,540
Turn it up.

1473
02:22:48,540 --> 02:22:50,079
Turn it up.

1474
02:22:50,079 --> 02:22:50,959
Turn it up.

1475
02:22:50,959 --> 02:22:56,020
I saved the world right here.

1476
02:22:56,020 --> 02:22:57,059
I just saved the world.

1477
02:23:29,340 --> 02:23:31,260
Don't destroy the green screen.

1478
02:23:31,260 --> 02:23:33,659
All right, hold on.

1479
02:23:52,739 --> 02:23:55,219
This was an incredibly highly requested thing.

1480
02:23:55,219 --> 02:23:56,739
And I don't know why, but you'll see.

1481
02:26:02,450 --> 02:26:06,690
He's getting into it.

1482
02:26:06,690 --> 02:26:08,420
Open it up.

1483
02:26:08,420 --> 02:26:12,899
Open it up.

1484
02:26:12,899 --> 02:26:14,020
Nobody asked for that.

1485
02:26:14,020 --> 02:26:16,100
That was like one of the top requested things.

1486
02:26:25,729 --> 02:26:27,809
I'm not putting the suit on and doing that.

1487
02:26:27,809 --> 02:26:33,899
This one was highly requested too.

1488
02:26:33,899 --> 02:26:34,620
Here, let me get it.

1489
02:26:34,620 --> 02:27:22,020
That's a little too high.

1490
02:27:22,020 --> 02:27:28,129
Is your ladder this?

1491
02:27:28,129 --> 02:27:31,260
Somebody monitor the driving.

1492
02:27:31,899 --> 02:27:33,729
Here's the lab boat wheel.

1493
02:28:29,790 --> 02:28:30,590
God.

1494
02:28:30,590 --> 02:28:59,739
Every various driving sequences.

1495
02:29:00,540 --> 02:29:05,139
Do it over the shoulder.

1496
02:29:05,139 --> 02:29:06,670
I mean like this.

1497
02:29:17,340 --> 02:29:17,840
Jesus.

1498
02:29:21,489 --> 02:29:22,209
Yeah.

1499
02:29:22,209 --> 02:29:24,930
Taking you guys on the scenic route.

1500
02:29:26,920 --> 02:29:33,379
Hey.

1501
02:29:33,379 --> 02:29:33,780
Careful.

1502
02:29:34,340 --> 02:29:41,329
Whoa.

1503
02:29:41,329 --> 02:29:42,129
Whoa.

1504
02:29:42,129 --> 02:29:48,239
Hey kids, you want to sing a car song?

1505
02:29:50,079 --> 02:29:50,799
I don't either.

1506
02:29:58,450 --> 02:30:06,530
Hey.

1507
02:30:06,530 --> 02:30:08,020
Dave, right?

1508
02:30:09,430 --> 02:30:10,389
Welcome to Lyft.

1509
02:30:10,389 --> 02:30:21,000
So you're from here?

1510
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:21,719
Yeah.

1511
02:30:21,719 --> 02:30:22,790
I grew up here.

1512
02:30:23,350 --> 02:30:25,440
I know all the secrets.

1513
02:30:25,440 --> 02:30:27,120
Don't like turn off your GPS.

1514
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:28,399
I know where I'm going.

1515
02:30:28,399 --> 02:30:34,229
What's that?

1516
02:30:34,229 --> 02:30:34,870
Yeah.

1517
02:30:34,870 --> 02:30:40,819
No, I've been driving for like probably a couple of years now on Lyft.

1518
02:30:42,959 --> 02:30:43,280
Right.

1519
02:30:45,879 --> 02:30:49,090
Yeah.

1520
02:30:49,090 --> 02:30:50,370
Yeah, well I moved.

1521
02:30:50,370 --> 02:30:52,690
I moved here when I was probably 19 or so.

1522
02:30:54,920 --> 02:30:55,159
Yeah.

1523
02:30:57,120 --> 02:30:57,600
Oh, shit.

1524
02:30:57,600 --> 02:30:57,840
Sorry.

1525
02:30:57,840 --> 02:30:58,079
Yeah.

1526
02:30:58,079 --> 02:30:58,399
Sorry.

1527
02:31:02,659 --> 02:31:03,379
It's a great place.

1528
02:31:03,379 --> 02:31:04,100
You'll probably like it.

1529
02:31:13,879 --> 02:31:15,000
He's off-roading.

1530
02:31:16,360 --> 02:31:17,719
He talked two months.

1531
02:31:19,239 --> 02:31:20,840
Do one facing you now.

1532
02:31:22,129 --> 02:31:23,329
How would that make any sense?

1533
02:31:30,770 --> 02:31:31,250
Hey.

1534
02:31:31,250 --> 02:31:31,489
Yeah.

1535
02:31:35,840 --> 02:31:36,159
Yeah.

1536
02:31:36,159 --> 02:31:37,280
Yeah, I've lived around here.

1537
02:31:37,280 --> 02:31:38,639
I've lived here for about 10 years.

1538
02:31:45,010 --> 02:31:46,770
Can you not do that?

1539
02:31:46,770 --> 02:31:50,200
Can you relax back there, please?

1540
02:31:50,920 --> 02:31:54,920
This is what you're doing is incredibly distracting.

1541
02:31:54,920 --> 02:31:55,239
That's all.

1542
02:31:57,860 --> 02:31:59,459
I'll get you out of the car if you don't.

1543
02:32:05,329 --> 02:32:05,809
Jesus.

1544
02:32:06,450 --> 02:32:08,799
Did you see that?

1545
02:32:09,520 --> 02:32:15,719
Why am I going back and forth like this?

1546
02:32:16,520 --> 02:32:23,829
No, I'm good.

1547
02:32:23,829 --> 02:32:24,309
I'm good.

1548
02:32:24,309 --> 02:32:24,629
I'm good.

1549
02:32:24,629 --> 02:32:25,430
I'm good.

1550
02:32:25,430 --> 02:32:25,829
I'm good.

1551
02:32:27,780 --> 02:32:28,659
Oh, shit.

1552
02:32:30,340 --> 02:32:30,739
I'm good.

1553
02:32:31,909 --> 02:32:32,389
No, I'm not.

1554
02:32:34,870 --> 02:32:44,260
Holy shit.

1555
02:32:55,670 --> 02:32:56,549
Look at you.

1556
02:32:57,590 --> 02:32:58,389
Like, look at.

1557
02:32:58,389 --> 02:32:58,709
Why?

1558
02:32:58,709 --> 02:32:59,829
That's creepy.

1559
02:32:59,829 --> 02:33:01,989
I just did the dinosaur thing.

1560
02:33:02,790 --> 02:33:04,389
Which I can't delete that now.

1561
02:33:05,030 --> 02:33:06,690
You want me to go like this?

1562
02:33:07,569 --> 02:33:10,690
Hey, how are you?

1563
02:33:10,690 --> 02:33:11,170
How you doing?

1564
02:33:11,729 --> 02:33:12,370
How are things?

1565
02:33:19,059 --> 02:33:19,940
Just don't talk.

1566
02:33:21,729 --> 02:33:22,049
What?

1567
02:33:35,110 --> 02:33:35,989
Why am I doing that?

1568
02:33:35,989 --> 02:33:36,629
All right, I'm done.

1569
02:33:44,389 --> 02:33:45,190
All right.

1570
02:33:45,190 --> 02:33:47,590
Let me get a water.

1571
02:33:47,590 --> 02:33:50,280
We're getting to the end here.

1572
02:33:50,280 --> 02:33:52,799
There's still like maybe five or 10 things left to do.

1573
02:33:56,420 --> 02:33:57,540
Oh, hold on.

1574
02:33:57,540 --> 02:34:03,399
Somebody wanted this real bad.

1575
02:34:15,040 --> 02:34:15,680
I need the soup.

1576
02:34:16,319 --> 02:34:32,290
The James Bond thing.

1577
02:34:49,510 --> 02:35:01,299
Everybody has socks on at this stage apparently.

1578
02:35:16,739 --> 02:35:17,540
I need shoes.

1579
02:35:18,260 --> 02:35:18,819
All right, hold on.

1580
02:35:18,819 --> 02:35:19,620
But I got to.

1581
02:35:19,620 --> 02:35:21,030
I have to like make it.

1582
02:35:21,030 --> 02:35:21,670
I have to.

1583
02:35:21,670 --> 02:35:23,030
I'm like going over right now.

1584
02:35:23,030 --> 02:35:24,950
I got to make like I got to text somebody.

1585
02:35:24,950 --> 02:35:27,620
Give me one second.

1586
02:35:27,620 --> 02:35:31,270
Let me write like BRB on the screen.

1587
02:35:31,270 --> 02:35:33,030
We got like maybe five or 10 things left to do.

1588
02:35:40,280 --> 02:35:40,840
Shoeless.

1589
02:35:41,479 --> 02:35:43,110
Here, hold on.

1590
02:35:43,670 --> 02:35:46,159
Give me like a few minutes.

1591
02:35:46,799 --> 02:35:49,190
I'll be right back.

1592
02:35:49,190 --> 02:35:54,340
I need text on here.

1593
02:35:57,620 --> 02:36:01,590
Where the no, I'm not putting the dinosaur thing on ever again.

1594
02:36:01,590 --> 02:36:03,909
You got your one like what a fucking joke.

1595
02:36:05,590 --> 02:36:06,469
That was so bad.

1596
02:36:17,809 --> 02:36:19,250
Like I am I am embarrassed.

1597
02:36:19,809 --> 02:36:20,690
I bought that shit.

1598
02:36:20,690 --> 02:36:22,610
You know what I mean?

1599
02:36:22,610 --> 02:36:23,250
I'll be right back.

1600
02:37:52,639 --> 02:37:53,680
I'm not back yet, by the way.

1601
02:37:53,680 --> 02:37:55,600
I just wanted to make sure I made this really, really clear.

1602
02:37:57,760 --> 02:38:05,250
So I've I've been drinking water out of the sink this whole time.

1603
02:38:05,969 --> 02:38:09,250
Like literally like drinking like toilet, like the water in the toilet.

1604
02:38:10,370 --> 02:38:12,370
They have like a they have like a water thing here.

1605
02:38:13,649 --> 02:38:15,010
Like in like in the other room.

1606
02:39:59,969 --> 02:40:00,209
Okay.

1607
02:40:01,329 --> 02:40:03,760
Somebody said weird flex, but okay.

1608
02:40:04,799 --> 02:40:07,489
What a weird flex.

1609
02:40:09,350 --> 02:40:09,670
All right.

1610
02:40:09,670 --> 02:40:16,579
So let's do what is I don't know what that means.

1611
02:40:18,950 --> 02:40:19,510
Stop.

1612
02:40:19,510 --> 02:40:20,469
Do some flexes.

1613
02:40:24,340 --> 02:40:26,100
Well, I got to put on my shoes again.

1614
02:40:26,100 --> 02:40:28,840
These suit pants aren't in the box.

1615
02:40:28,840 --> 02:40:34,159
Is this a good James Bond hat?

1616
02:40:34,879 --> 02:40:44,239
No, it's like an old grandma gardening hat.

1617
02:40:44,879 --> 02:40:48,530
What did I put?

1618
02:40:48,530 --> 02:40:49,329
Why do I have this?

1619
02:41:04,280 --> 02:41:05,079
It's perfect.

1620
02:41:07,670 --> 02:41:09,190
It's the undertaker.

1621
02:41:21,639 --> 02:41:23,000
I don't know what my other shoe is.

1622
02:41:29,430 --> 02:41:30,309
Do you see my shoe?

1623
02:41:33,090 --> 02:41:34,049
I I I did.

1624
02:41:34,049 --> 02:41:35,489
I actually I don't know where it is.

1625
02:41:35,489 --> 02:41:37,329
I have no idea what my other shoe is.

1626
02:41:37,329 --> 02:42:00,579
Please pretend to be a grandma gardening in a suit.

1627
02:42:01,379 --> 02:42:06,549
Oh, there's like so many other things people requested.

1628
02:42:06,549 --> 02:42:07,190
I this I got.

1629
02:42:18,629 --> 02:42:30,600
I laugh because these these fell out of the bag.

1630
02:42:31,799 --> 02:43:14,930
Shitty boss from like an anime.

1631
02:43:15,729 --> 02:43:21,620
I'm like the one henchman that the guy goes through before he goes to the real bad guy.

1632
02:43:22,260 --> 02:44:05,760
Coffee space Spider-Man.

1633
02:44:20,120 --> 02:44:21,559
Think of blood-borne enemy.

1634
02:44:22,200 --> 02:46:42,479
Oh shit, zombies, zombies.

1635
02:46:42,479 --> 02:47:00,159
No, forget about the zombies.

1636
02:47:00,159 --> 02:47:00,879
You got it.

1637
02:47:00,879 --> 02:47:03,440
Here we go.

1638
02:47:03,440 --> 02:47:03,920
Let's have this.

1639
02:47:38,450 --> 02:47:43,680
Oh, did I get him?

1640
02:47:43,680 --> 02:48:15,200
I know I got him.

1641
02:48:15,200 --> 02:48:15,520
Sure.

1642
02:48:15,520 --> 02:48:29,600
Oh, new shirt going on.

1643
02:48:29,600 --> 02:48:42,899
I'm going to regret this.

1644
02:48:43,459 --> 02:48:45,250
All right.

1645
02:48:45,250 --> 02:48:48,450
So you guys tell me, you think I'm going to regret this more than I regret already

1646
02:48:48,450 --> 02:48:49,090
the dinosaur?

1647
02:49:35,700 --> 02:50:07,879
Oh, it was a clean bar.

1648
02:50:14,180 --> 02:50:22,420
Delete that one, too.

1649
02:50:22,420 --> 02:50:26,309
I want you to delete that whole thing.

1650
02:50:26,309 --> 02:50:41,030
That's got to be the biggest.

1651
02:50:41,030 --> 02:50:42,870
That's going to be the biggest bane I've ever seen.

1652
02:50:43,510 --> 02:50:45,379
Good thing I got this.

1653
02:50:53,729 --> 02:50:55,329
Sell that to a merchant.

1654
02:50:55,329 --> 02:51:02,799
Do you think I'll be able to get it with this?

1655
02:51:02,799 --> 02:51:11,110
I'll try just barely.

1656
02:51:11,110 --> 02:51:11,909
One more.

1657
02:51:11,909 --> 02:51:15,340
All right.

1658
02:51:17,860 --> 02:51:18,100
Nice.

1659
02:51:22,629 --> 02:51:23,030
Throw it.

1660
02:51:27,239 --> 02:51:38,360
You guys mind if I mine here?

1661
02:51:38,360 --> 02:51:51,719
Not a big deal, dude.

1662
02:51:51,719 --> 02:52:00,209
I mean, this is my house.

1663
02:52:00,209 --> 02:52:02,520
And it's much better than yours.

1664
02:52:02,520 --> 02:52:13,930
Well, I do get a pretty sweet house.

1665
02:52:13,930 --> 02:52:16,930
Way better than your Minecraft house, dude.

1666
02:52:16,930 --> 02:52:39,040
What's that?

1667
02:52:39,040 --> 02:52:40,209
Oh, you like!

1668
02:52:40,209 --> 02:52:43,579
You like what I have here, don't you?

1669
02:52:43,579 --> 02:52:44,819
Yeah.

1670
02:52:44,819 --> 02:52:47,190
Well, how do you think I made it?

1671
02:52:47,190 --> 02:53:04,600
You're in my garage.

1672
02:53:05,159 --> 02:53:57,219
Is he taking requests?

1673
02:53:57,219 --> 02:53:58,219
Yes.

1674
02:53:58,219 --> 02:54:04,059
When I'm done with all the ones that I want to do, he'll take requests.

1675
02:54:04,059 --> 02:54:07,680
Oh my god, this looks like shit.

1676
02:54:07,680 --> 02:54:23,719
And don't forget about me, the newest turtle, Socrates.

1677
02:54:23,719 --> 02:54:30,309
I may be small, but I sure got lots of power.

1678
02:54:30,309 --> 02:54:47,500
And don't forget about me, the newest turtle, Socrates.

1679
02:54:47,500 --> 02:54:52,500
With my trusty curved blade, I slash those putties like nobody's business.

1680
02:54:53,059 --> 02:54:54,059
Check me out.

1681
02:54:54,059 --> 02:54:57,059
You'll see a little bit of footage right here.

1682
02:54:57,059 --> 02:55:22,920
That's right, Donatello.

1683
02:55:22,920 --> 02:55:24,920
And we should all eat our vegetables.

1684
02:55:24,920 --> 02:55:32,399
Like, ah!

1685
02:55:32,399 --> 02:55:38,379
That's right, Donatello.

1686
02:55:38,379 --> 02:55:39,379
And another thing.

1687
02:55:39,379 --> 02:55:41,379
Eat your vegetables and fruits, too.

1688
02:55:41,379 --> 02:55:43,379
They make you grow up big and strong like us turtles.

1689
02:55:43,379 --> 02:55:50,360
Like me, Leonardo.

1690
02:55:50,360 --> 02:55:51,360
Just stuff like that.

1691
02:55:51,360 --> 02:55:57,370
When you're older.

1692
02:55:57,370 --> 02:55:59,370
Not a great example.

1693
02:55:59,370 --> 02:56:33,000
There's too many of them.

1694
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:42,319
There's too many of them.

1695
02:56:42,879 --> 02:57:34,840
Princess Bride?

1696
02:57:34,840 --> 02:57:42,639
God damn it.

1697
02:57:42,639 --> 02:57:48,209
I did the same thing I just did again.

1698
02:57:48,209 --> 02:57:59,030
Here's the only difference.

1699
02:57:59,030 --> 02:58:00,030
I can't wear this.

1700
02:58:00,030 --> 02:58:27,930
I look like a fucking idiot.

1701
02:58:27,930 --> 02:58:40,030
This is made for a kid.

1702
02:58:40,030 --> 02:58:42,459
This is supposed to be down here.

1703
02:58:42,459 --> 02:58:44,459
This is made for like a fucking seven year old.

1704
02:58:44,459 --> 02:58:57,819
I'm in like an X-wing.

1705
02:58:57,819 --> 02:59:02,750
Fighter One, what's your status?

1706
02:59:02,750 --> 02:59:04,750
That's right, let's take it to them hot guys.

1707
02:59:04,750 --> 02:59:09,120
Come on.

1708
02:59:09,120 --> 02:59:13,559
Watch your six.

1709
02:59:13,559 --> 02:59:14,559
Ah, I can't see him.

1710
02:59:14,559 --> 02:59:15,559
I can't get him.

1711
02:59:15,559 --> 02:59:24,100
I can't get him.

1712
02:59:24,100 --> 02:59:25,100
I can't see him.

1713
02:59:25,659 --> 02:59:28,729
That is a negative here, man.

1714
02:59:28,729 --> 02:59:32,729
Hey, maybe you can get us a few rounds when we're done with this.

1715
02:59:32,729 --> 02:59:37,489
You know what I'm saying?

1716
02:59:37,489 --> 02:59:38,489
Watch out.

1717
02:59:38,489 --> 02:59:39,489
Watch out.

1718
02:59:39,489 --> 02:59:40,860
TIE fighters.

1719
02:59:40,860 --> 02:59:41,860
TIE fighters coming in.

1720
02:59:41,860 --> 02:59:44,510
Left side.

1721
02:59:44,510 --> 02:59:45,510
Right side.

1722
02:59:45,510 --> 02:59:46,510
Got him.

1723
02:59:46,510 --> 02:59:50,180
Got him.

1724
02:59:50,180 --> 02:59:51,180
Watch your tail there.

1725
02:59:51,180 --> 02:59:55,879
I'm right behind you.

1726
02:59:55,879 --> 02:59:57,370
Yeah!

1727
02:59:57,370 --> 02:59:58,370
Yeah!

1728
02:59:58,370 --> 02:59:59,370
I'm going down.

1729
02:59:59,370 --> 03:00:00,370
No, I'm going down.

1730
03:00:00,370 --> 03:00:01,370
I'm going down.

1731
03:00:01,370 --> 03:00:02,370
This is Fighter One.

1732
03:00:02,370 --> 03:00:03,930
I'm going down.

1733
03:00:03,930 --> 03:00:04,930
Fighter One going down.

1734
03:00:04,930 --> 03:00:08,219
Mayday!

1735
03:00:08,219 --> 03:00:43,809
No, I'm going to need it here.

1736
03:00:49,989 --> 03:00:58,500
This is the strangest plan I think I've ever been to.

1737
03:00:58,500 --> 03:01:01,600
Don't start with me here.

1738
03:01:01,600 --> 03:01:03,600
I am a pilot, but I'm also a Jedi too.

1739
03:01:03,600 --> 03:01:31,610
Can you hit that shit?

1740
03:01:31,610 --> 03:01:33,610
I can't take this.

1741
03:01:33,610 --> 03:01:45,260
Why would I take it serious?

1742
03:01:45,260 --> 03:01:47,260
I'm trying to close it.

1743
03:01:47,260 --> 03:01:58,319
It won't close.

1744
03:01:58,319 --> 03:02:12,329
Man, I already broke it.

1745
03:02:12,329 --> 03:02:14,659
Ah!

1746
03:02:14,659 --> 03:02:23,709
I don't think I can do it.

1747
03:02:23,709 --> 03:02:33,459
Let's try this again.

1748
03:02:33,459 --> 03:02:43,020
Really.

1749
03:02:43,020 --> 03:02:44,020
I just have to let you know.

1750
03:02:44,020 --> 03:02:50,079
You strike me down now, and I will become so much stronger than you.

1751
03:02:50,639 --> 03:02:53,639
I'll be at least a full tier up on a fighting game list than you.

1752
03:02:53,639 --> 03:03:35,770
And that was just me showing off.

1753
03:03:35,770 --> 03:04:12,059
It's time for the real fight.

1754
03:04:12,059 --> 03:04:13,059
Easy for you to say.

1755
03:04:13,059 --> 03:04:17,629
You're an evil Sith, but not me.

1756
03:04:17,629 --> 03:04:25,120
I'm a Jedi.

1757
03:04:25,120 --> 03:04:27,829
Oh!

1758
03:04:27,829 --> 03:04:28,829
Please don't kill me.

1759
03:04:28,829 --> 03:04:29,829
Please don't kill me.

1760
03:04:29,829 --> 03:04:31,129
Please.

1761
03:04:31,129 --> 03:04:33,440
I'll be a Sith.

1762
03:04:33,440 --> 03:04:35,440
I will join the Sith right now.

1763
03:04:35,440 --> 03:04:37,680
I'll just join the Sith.

1764
03:04:37,680 --> 03:04:43,719
I pledge allegiance to be a Sith for the United States of America.

1765
03:04:44,280 --> 03:04:47,280
And to not the Republic, but to the Imperial for which you stand, the employer of the Empire,

1766
03:04:47,280 --> 03:04:53,440
one nation under, Dark Vader.

1767
03:04:53,440 --> 03:04:56,729
Ah!

1768
03:04:56,729 --> 03:05:23,760
Ah!

1769
03:05:23,760 --> 03:05:45,399
Two more Star Wars.

1770
03:05:45,399 --> 03:05:48,399
Why is he spending so much time on Star Wars?

1771
03:05:48,399 --> 03:06:00,920
Even the darkest Star Wars fantasies.

1772
03:06:00,920 --> 03:06:06,010
How could you possibly make this into a clip?

1773
03:06:06,010 --> 03:06:11,010
I'm just acting out a fake scene that doesn't exist.

1774
03:06:11,010 --> 03:06:20,590
I just made up a scene that is not a scene in any movie.

1775
03:06:21,149 --> 03:06:25,079
Good luck.

1776
03:06:25,079 --> 03:06:28,569
I'll just do like standard lightsaber shit.

1777
03:06:28,569 --> 03:06:35,010
What the fuck was that?

1778
03:06:35,010 --> 03:06:40,010
I'm like fucking exhausted right now.

1779
03:06:40,010 --> 03:06:44,280
I've been going nonstop with this for three hours.

1780
03:06:44,280 --> 03:06:46,280
I've been drinking toilet water.

1781
03:06:46,280 --> 03:06:48,280
I've been drinking toilet water.

1782
03:06:48,280 --> 03:06:50,600
From the toilet.

1783
03:06:50,600 --> 03:06:52,600
From the toilet, by the way.

1784
03:06:52,600 --> 03:07:29,149
I just did this.

1785
03:07:29,149 --> 03:07:30,149
I just did this.

1786
03:07:30,149 --> 03:07:31,149
All right, that's it.

1787
03:07:31,149 --> 03:07:32,149
We're moving away from Star Wars.

1788
03:07:32,149 --> 03:07:33,149
I'm done with Star Wars.

1789
03:07:33,709 --> 03:07:57,790
Hi, I'm Jerma985, and you're watching the Disney Channel.

1790
03:07:57,790 --> 03:08:13,610
Hey, it's me, Jerma985, and you're watching the Disney Channel.

1791
03:08:13,610 --> 03:08:46,889
Hey, it's me, Jerma, and you're watching the Disney Channel.

1792
03:08:46,889 --> 03:08:52,889
Hey, it's me, Jerma, from the downtown of Center Sports.

1793
03:08:52,889 --> 03:08:54,889
You're watching the Disney Channel.

1794
03:08:54,889 --> 03:09:19,000
I'm already not from Disney.

1795
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:31,159
Hey, it's Jerma from Jerma985, and you're watching Jerma985.

1796
03:09:31,719 --> 03:09:36,479
Oh, I hated that one.

1797
03:09:36,479 --> 03:09:39,360
I'm doing it again.

1798
03:09:39,360 --> 03:09:40,360
Expelliarmus!

1799
03:09:40,360 --> 03:09:46,129
Hey, it's Jerma from Jerma985, and you're watching...

1800
03:09:46,129 --> 03:09:47,129
Expelliarmus!

1801
03:09:47,129 --> 03:09:57,989
Hey, you know, this thing!

1802
03:09:57,989 --> 03:10:00,989
That thing, da-da-da-da!

1803
03:10:16,670 --> 03:10:23,350
Hey, what's going on?

1804
03:10:23,350 --> 03:10:27,350
It's Jerma from Jerma985, and you're watching Jerma985.

1805
03:10:27,350 --> 03:10:30,760
No.

1806
03:10:30,760 --> 03:10:50,629
All right.

1807
03:10:50,629 --> 03:11:02,090
Hey, dude.

1808
03:11:02,090 --> 03:11:03,520
Hey, dude.

1809
03:11:03,520 --> 03:11:04,700
Hey.

1810
03:11:04,700 --> 03:11:14,559
Do you think I can reach?

1811
03:11:15,120 --> 03:11:16,739
Oh!

1812
03:11:16,739 --> 03:11:39,159
Oh, fuck!

1813
03:11:39,159 --> 03:11:40,850
Shut up, dude!

1814
03:11:40,850 --> 03:11:41,850
Shut the fuck up!

1815
03:11:41,850 --> 03:11:44,950
We're gonna get caught!

1816
03:11:44,950 --> 03:12:02,569
As you can see, I'm not very good at this.

1817
03:12:02,569 --> 03:12:03,569
Oh, I forgot about this one.

1818
03:12:03,569 --> 03:12:05,319
I forgot to put this on.

1819
03:12:05,319 --> 03:12:08,950
This is the one where I have to pretend I'm a toy from Toy Story.

1820
03:12:08,950 --> 03:12:36,559
Yeah!

1821
03:12:36,559 --> 03:12:38,440
Yeah!

1822
03:12:38,440 --> 03:13:01,479
It's a chance at spawning a Gmod rag doll.

1823
03:13:01,479 --> 03:13:02,840
All right, what's left?

1824
03:13:02,840 --> 03:13:03,840
Oh, god damn it.

1825
03:13:03,840 --> 03:13:05,280
I don't even have...

1826
03:13:05,280 --> 03:13:06,280
Oh, come on.

1827
03:13:06,280 --> 03:13:08,860
Get this one out of the way.

1828
03:13:08,860 --> 03:13:09,860
Can you see?

1829
03:13:09,860 --> 03:13:29,600
Oh, god.

1830
03:13:29,600 --> 03:13:34,610
Look!

1831
03:13:34,610 --> 03:13:38,350
Look!

1832
03:13:38,350 --> 03:13:39,520
That's fucked up.

1833
03:13:40,079 --> 03:14:03,079
Look.

1834
03:14:03,079 --> 03:14:04,079
Is that what that is?

1835
03:14:04,079 --> 03:14:49,239
That is a weird, weird image there.

1836
03:14:49,239 --> 03:14:50,239
Get the string off!

1837
03:14:50,239 --> 03:15:13,180
Is there like a...

1838
03:15:13,180 --> 03:15:14,180
That's like Gears of War, right?

1839
03:15:14,180 --> 03:15:15,180
That's like Gears of War shit, isn't it?

1840
03:15:15,180 --> 03:15:16,180
Just put like a chainsaw sound in here.

1841
03:15:16,180 --> 03:15:18,700
Sure.

1842
03:15:18,700 --> 03:15:19,700
All right.

1843
03:15:19,700 --> 03:15:31,559
I gotta look at my list, because I think there's only like three or four things

1844
03:15:31,559 --> 03:15:32,559
left to do.

1845
03:15:32,559 --> 03:15:33,559
Do the meme shit.

1846
03:15:33,559 --> 03:15:39,729
And that's gonna be it.

1847
03:15:39,729 --> 03:15:40,909
He looks like Mark Zuckerberg.

1848
03:15:40,909 --> 03:15:41,909
Okay, man.

1849
03:15:41,909 --> 03:15:42,909
So, here's the new, uh, here's the new phone.

1850
03:15:42,909 --> 03:15:43,909
Is that what he does?

1851
03:15:43,909 --> 03:15:44,909
What does he do?

1852
03:15:44,909 --> 03:15:46,719
Here's the new phone, dude.

1853
03:15:46,719 --> 03:15:47,719
All right, it's time for meme shit.

1854
03:15:47,719 --> 03:15:48,719
So, here's the new phone.

1855
03:15:48,719 --> 03:15:49,719
Wait, Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook now?

1856
03:15:49,719 --> 03:15:50,719
Well, I was gonna say like...

1857
03:15:50,719 --> 03:15:53,120
What?

1858
03:15:53,120 --> 03:15:54,120
What?

1859
03:15:54,120 --> 03:15:57,079
What?

1860
03:15:57,079 --> 03:15:58,079
What?

1861
03:15:58,079 --> 03:15:59,079
What?

1862
03:15:59,079 --> 03:16:00,639
What?

1863
03:16:00,639 --> 03:16:01,639
What?

1864
03:16:01,639 --> 03:16:02,639
What?

1865
03:16:02,639 --> 03:16:04,329
What?

1866
03:16:04,329 --> 03:16:05,329
What?

1867
03:16:05,329 --> 03:16:08,750
What?

1868
03:16:08,750 --> 03:16:09,750
What?

1869
03:16:09,750 --> 03:16:14,250
What?

1870
03:16:14,250 --> 03:16:15,250
What?

1871
03:16:15,250 --> 03:16:20,329
What?

1872
03:16:20,329 --> 03:16:24,389
What?

1873
03:16:24,389 --> 03:16:25,389
What?

1874
03:16:25,389 --> 03:16:26,389
What?

1875
03:16:32,620 --> 03:16:33,620
Why was I like...

1876
03:16:34,620 --> 03:16:35,620
Why was I like an Apple?

1877
03:16:35,620 --> 03:16:36,620
What does that have to do with anything?

1878
03:16:36,620 --> 03:16:41,700
Pretend to pull a lever?

1879
03:16:41,700 --> 03:16:43,069
You got it.

1880
03:16:43,069 --> 03:16:53,329
Oh!

1881
03:16:53,329 --> 03:16:57,260
I didn't do it.

1882
03:16:57,260 --> 03:17:07,780
All right, let me look at my list.

1883
03:17:07,780 --> 03:17:26,360
There's probably not much more.

1884
03:17:26,360 --> 03:17:27,360
Um, perform CPR.

1885
03:17:27,360 --> 03:17:28,360
But on what, though?

1886
03:17:28,360 --> 03:17:34,340
Oh, I need to do this.

1887
03:17:34,340 --> 03:17:35,340
I forgot.

1888
03:17:35,340 --> 03:17:42,430
It's a different green though.

1889
03:17:42,430 --> 03:17:51,479
Stupefy!

1890
03:17:51,479 --> 03:17:52,479
Stupefy!

1891
03:17:52,479 --> 03:18:08,350
We have to get out of here!

1892
03:18:08,350 --> 03:18:10,360
Expelliarmus!

1893
03:18:10,360 --> 03:18:11,360
Expelliarmus!

1894
03:18:11,360 --> 03:18:14,069
Quick!

1895
03:18:14,069 --> 03:18:15,440
Hagrid!

1896
03:18:15,440 --> 03:18:17,059
Gedondo!

1897
03:18:17,059 --> 03:18:18,059
Be right back!

1898
03:18:18,059 --> 03:18:19,059
Get out of here!

1899
03:18:19,059 --> 03:18:32,840
Are they gone?

1900
03:18:32,840 --> 03:18:44,500
Get out of here!

1901
03:18:44,500 --> 03:18:45,500
Stupefy!

1902
03:18:45,500 --> 03:18:47,760
Stupefy!

1903
03:18:47,760 --> 03:18:48,760
Stupefy!

1904
03:18:48,760 --> 03:18:49,760
I had to do that at least once.

1905
03:18:49,760 --> 03:18:57,600
Oh, I need to do this.

1906
03:18:57,600 --> 03:18:58,600
This is going to be hard.

1907
03:18:58,600 --> 03:19:05,920
This is not going to work.

1908
03:19:05,920 --> 03:19:11,569
It's not going to work.

1909
03:19:11,569 --> 03:19:21,959
This needs like a green mask.

1910
03:19:21,959 --> 03:19:22,959
I can probably do this.

1911
03:19:22,959 --> 03:19:26,889
Two different greens.

1912
03:19:26,889 --> 03:19:44,959
This is wearing a dress.

1913
03:19:44,959 --> 03:19:45,959
I'm just wearing a dress.

1914
03:19:45,959 --> 03:19:52,200
Frieza versus Goku.

1915
03:19:52,200 --> 03:20:01,819
I already did all my Spirit Bomb.

1916
03:20:01,819 --> 03:20:14,069
Let me try it again.

1917
03:20:14,069 --> 03:20:15,069
Somebody really wanted this.

1918
03:20:15,069 --> 03:20:18,680
I'll try and get it there.

1919
03:20:18,680 --> 03:20:19,680
Nope.

1920
03:20:19,680 --> 03:20:26,040
That ain't going to work.

1921
03:20:26,040 --> 03:20:27,040
Oh!

1922
03:20:27,040 --> 03:20:28,040
Oh!

1923
03:20:28,040 --> 03:20:29,040
I can't get up.

1924
03:20:29,040 --> 03:20:31,489
I'm stuck in here.

1925
03:20:31,489 --> 03:20:33,690
Actually, I'm stuck in my shirt.

1926
03:20:33,690 --> 03:20:34,690
I don't look like such a dickhead.

1927
03:20:34,690 --> 03:20:35,690
No.

1928
03:20:35,690 --> 03:20:47,940
All right.

1929
03:20:47,940 --> 03:20:48,940
Let's move on to some meme shit.

1930
03:20:48,940 --> 03:21:08,680
Start with this one.

1931
03:21:08,680 --> 03:21:19,500
Here we go.

1932
03:21:19,500 --> 03:21:20,500
If two of the handlers were one in the bush, it looks like this is going to

1933
03:21:20,500 --> 03:21:27,309
be the end.

1934
03:21:27,309 --> 03:21:29,059
This is going to be the end.

1935
03:21:29,059 --> 03:21:30,059
This is going to be the end.

1936
03:21:30,059 --> 03:21:31,059
This is going to be the end.

1937
03:21:31,059 --> 03:21:32,360
This is going to be the end.

1938
03:21:32,360 --> 03:21:33,360
This is going to be the end.

1939
03:21:33,360 --> 03:21:37,229
This is going to be the end.

1940
03:21:37,229 --> 03:21:39,559
This is going to be the end.

1941
03:21:39,559 --> 03:21:40,559
This is going to be the end.

1942
03:21:40,559 --> 03:21:43,010
This is going to be the end.

1943
03:21:43,010 --> 03:21:56,159
This is going to be the end.

1944
03:21:56,159 --> 03:22:04,440
This is going to be the end.

1945
03:22:04,440 --> 03:22:10,280
This is going to be the end.

1946
03:22:10,280 --> 03:22:11,280
This is going to be the end.

1947
03:22:11,280 --> 03:22:12,280
This is going to be the end.

1948
03:22:12,280 --> 03:22:14,360
This is going to be the end.

1949
03:22:14,360 --> 03:22:15,360
This is going to be the end.

1950
03:22:15,360 --> 03:22:16,360
This is going to be the end.

1951
03:22:16,360 --> 03:22:26,750
This is going to be the end.

1952
03:22:26,750 --> 03:22:27,750
This is going to be the end.

1953
03:22:27,750 --> 03:22:29,239
This is going to be the end.

1954
03:22:29,239 --> 03:22:38,479
This is going to be the end.

1955
03:22:38,479 --> 03:22:39,479
This is going to be the end.

1956
03:22:39,479 --> 03:22:40,479
This is going to be the end.

1957
03:22:40,479 --> 03:22:41,479
This is going to be the end.

1958
03:22:41,479 --> 03:22:43,430
This is going to be the end.

1959
03:22:43,430 --> 03:22:44,430
It's gone.

1960
03:22:44,430 --> 03:22:47,590
Knock, knock.

1961
03:22:47,590 --> 03:22:52,860
Who's there?

1962
03:22:52,860 --> 03:22:53,860
Aren't you glad I didn't say banana?

1963
03:22:53,860 --> 03:23:02,969
Put this guy in a body bag.

1964
03:23:02,969 --> 03:23:04,600
He's dead.

1965
03:23:04,600 --> 03:23:07,950
Well, well, I mean, they do say it's got to be five o'clock somewhere.

1966
03:23:07,950 --> 03:23:08,950
Oh, yeah!

1967
03:23:08,950 --> 03:23:11,920
Well, it's got to be five o'clock somewhere, as my professor told me.

1968
03:23:11,920 --> 03:23:12,920
It's high in noon somewhere.

1969
03:23:12,920 --> 03:23:13,920
Yeah, that's too bad.

1970
03:23:13,920 --> 03:23:22,770
But they do say it's got to be five o'clock somewhere, as my professor told me.

1971
03:23:22,770 --> 03:23:23,770
It's high in noon somewhere.

1972
03:23:23,770 --> 03:23:25,399
Yeah, that's too bad.

1973
03:23:25,399 --> 03:23:27,850
But they do say it's got to be five o'clock somewhere, as my professor told me.

1974
03:23:27,850 --> 03:23:28,850
It's high in noon somewhere.

1975
03:23:28,850 --> 03:23:29,850
Yeah, that's too bad.

1976
03:23:29,850 --> 03:23:30,850
But they do say it's got to be five o'clock somewhere, as my professor told me.

1977
03:24:02,120 --> 03:24:18,530
It's high in noon somewhere.

1978
03:24:18,530 --> 03:24:19,530
Stop going off screen, Mr. Green.

1979
03:24:19,530 --> 03:24:23,010
Last one.

1980
03:24:23,010 --> 03:24:24,010
You know, they say the stars align for this wine.

1981
03:24:24,010 --> 03:24:33,250
So, what do we got here?

1982
03:24:33,250 --> 03:24:39,229
Two.

1983
03:24:39,229 --> 03:24:40,229
We know what they say.

1984
03:24:40,229 --> 03:24:42,879
Two is more than one.

1985
03:24:42,879 --> 03:24:53,520
All right, that's one.

1986
03:24:53,520 --> 03:24:54,520
Next up is...

1987
03:24:54,520 --> 03:24:57,940
Oh, what was the other meme shit?

1988
03:24:57,940 --> 03:25:00,649
It was Jojo poses.

1989
03:25:00,649 --> 03:25:02,149
I don't even have any idea what the fuck.

1990
03:25:02,149 --> 03:25:03,149
What was the other one?

1991
03:25:03,149 --> 03:25:06,049
What was the other meme one?

1992
03:25:06,049 --> 03:25:19,709
Oh, okay, right.

1993
03:25:19,709 --> 03:25:23,319
What was the other meme one?

1994
03:25:23,319 --> 03:25:24,319
Oh, okay, right.

1995
03:25:24,319 --> 03:25:26,639
What was the other meme one?

1996
03:25:26,639 --> 03:25:27,639
Oh, okay, right.

1997
03:25:27,639 --> 03:25:28,639
What was the other meme one?

1998
03:25:28,639 --> 03:25:29,639
Oh, okay, right.

1999
03:25:29,639 --> 03:25:31,780
What was the other meme one?

2000
03:25:31,780 --> 03:25:32,780
Oh, okay, right.

2001
03:25:32,780 --> 03:25:33,780
What was the other meme one?

2002
03:25:33,780 --> 03:25:35,719
What was the other one?

2003
03:25:35,719 --> 03:25:39,180
What was the other meme one?

2004
03:25:39,180 --> 03:25:52,450
Oh, okay, right, right.

2005
03:25:52,450 --> 03:25:53,450
It was the snaps.

2006
03:25:53,450 --> 03:25:58,479
All right, so I need...

2007
03:25:58,479 --> 03:26:02,069
Spoilers for Infinity War.

2008
03:26:02,069 --> 03:26:05,069
If you haven't seen it yet, you have.

2009
03:26:05,069 --> 03:26:06,069
You've fucking seen Infinity War.

2010
03:26:06,069 --> 03:26:09,069
There's nobody in this chat that has not seen Infinity War.

2011
03:26:09,069 --> 03:26:12,069
Not one of you has not seen it.

2012
03:26:12,069 --> 03:26:15,069
But mute for the next 45 minutes.

2013
03:26:27,149 --> 03:26:39,719
Are you sure?

2014
03:26:39,719 --> 03:27:01,159
I don't even have an Infinity Gauntlet on.

2015
03:27:01,159 --> 03:27:08,750
It's like I'm just a guy.

2016
03:27:08,750 --> 03:27:21,979
You should have gone for the head.

2017
03:27:21,979 --> 03:27:27,420
And because of this, I'm going to do it with two hands.

2018
03:27:27,420 --> 03:27:29,420
And everyone dies.

2019
03:27:29,420 --> 03:27:33,219
Wait, wait, wait.

2020
03:27:33,219 --> 03:27:34,219
That means me, too.

2021
03:27:34,219 --> 03:27:35,219
No, wait, wait, wait.

2022
03:27:35,219 --> 03:27:36,219
No, that means me.

2023
03:27:36,219 --> 03:27:37,219
No, no, no.

2024
03:27:37,219 --> 03:27:38,219
I didn't not take it back.

2025
03:27:38,219 --> 03:27:39,219
Hey, Mr. Stark.

2026
03:27:39,219 --> 03:27:49,909
I don't feel so good.

2027
03:27:49,909 --> 03:27:51,909
Oh, there I go.

2028
03:27:51,909 --> 03:27:58,649
No, no, no.

2029
03:27:58,649 --> 03:28:05,590
Please, please, Mr. Stark.

2030
03:28:05,590 --> 03:28:06,590
Please, Mr. Stark.

2031
03:28:06,590 --> 03:28:20,280
I don't feel so good.

2032
03:28:20,280 --> 03:28:21,590
I don't feel so good.

2033
03:28:21,590 --> 03:28:29,270
I don't feel so good about this.

2034
03:28:29,270 --> 03:28:31,020
No, no, no.

2035
03:28:31,020 --> 03:28:35,629
I don't feel so good.

2036
03:28:35,629 --> 03:28:38,659
No, no.

2037
03:28:40,659 --> 03:28:42,959
That's all I took myself back together

2038
03:28:42,959 --> 03:28:44,959
is to get the particles back in me.

2039
03:28:44,959 --> 03:29:00,760
Do the slap chop.

2040
03:29:00,760 --> 03:29:01,760
Hey, it spins with the slap chop.

2041
03:29:01,760 --> 03:29:02,760
Yeah, you're going to slap.

2042
03:29:02,760 --> 03:29:03,760
You're going to cry.

2043
03:29:03,760 --> 03:29:04,760
Your onions cry.

2044
03:29:04,760 --> 03:29:05,760
You're making me cry.

2045
03:29:05,760 --> 03:29:06,760
Yeah, throw it in the fucking sink.

2046
03:29:06,760 --> 03:29:09,760
So what we got here, quickest tuna salad you ever made.

2047
03:29:09,760 --> 03:29:10,760
Here we go.

2048
03:29:10,760 --> 03:29:11,760
Slap it a couple of times.

2049
03:29:11,760 --> 03:29:12,760
One, two, three.

2050
03:29:12,760 --> 03:29:13,760
Easy as pie.

2051
03:29:13,760 --> 03:29:16,760
The thing to clean it, it opens up like a butterfly.

2052
03:29:16,760 --> 03:29:17,760
See?

2053
03:29:17,760 --> 03:29:18,760
Take a look at that.

2054
03:29:18,760 --> 03:29:19,760
See?

2055
03:29:19,760 --> 03:29:20,760
It's easy.

2056
03:29:20,760 --> 03:29:21,760
No, no, no mess.

2057
03:29:21,760 --> 03:29:22,760
No bullshit.

2058
03:29:22,760 --> 03:29:24,760
Throw it in the fucking sink behind me.

2059
03:29:24,760 --> 03:29:27,469
Oh, my God.

2060
03:29:27,469 --> 03:29:33,680
I just died.

2061
03:29:33,680 --> 03:29:34,680
All right.

2062
03:29:34,680 --> 03:29:41,879
Time to do some JoJo poses.

2063
03:29:41,879 --> 03:29:47,000
I was turning into Trump.

2064
03:29:47,000 --> 03:30:01,809
All right.

2065
03:30:01,809 --> 03:30:02,809
I'm looking at it.

2066
03:30:02,809 --> 03:30:03,809
I looked at this.

2067
03:30:03,809 --> 03:30:08,479
Somebody sent me like a compilation.

2068
03:30:08,479 --> 03:30:11,559
JoJo poses.

2069
03:30:11,559 --> 03:30:12,559
Which one am I typing in?

2070
03:30:12,559 --> 03:30:20,860
I'll do like three or four of them.

2071
03:30:20,860 --> 03:30:23,290
Am I going to hate this for the rest of my life?

2072
03:30:23,290 --> 03:30:24,290
What's worse?

2073
03:30:24,290 --> 03:30:26,600
Like, honestly, what's worse?

2074
03:30:26,600 --> 03:30:39,579
JoJo poses or the Velociraptor?

2075
03:30:39,579 --> 03:30:40,579
Really?

2076
03:30:40,579 --> 03:30:45,149
The Velociraptor is probably the worst thing I've ever done.

2077
03:30:45,149 --> 03:30:46,149
I mean, in my whole life.

2078
03:30:46,149 --> 03:30:48,389
In my actual entire life.

2079
03:30:48,389 --> 03:30:53,459
I can't think of anything that I would rather go back and redo.

2080
03:30:53,459 --> 03:30:57,959
You know, if I had a time machine, it was like, oh, hey, you could go back and fix one thing.

2081
03:30:57,959 --> 03:31:00,129
What would you fix?

2082
03:31:00,129 --> 03:31:02,129
It would be me doing that Velociraptor.

2083
03:31:02,129 --> 03:31:04,129
Now I understand why somebody wanted me to do it.

2084
03:31:04,129 --> 03:31:08,129
Now I get it why it was like one of the things that somebody put it in the channel there.

2085
03:31:08,129 --> 03:31:11,129
Because holy shit, that was the most embarrassing thing I've ever done.

2086
03:31:11,129 --> 03:31:13,129
And I can never take it back.

2087
03:31:13,129 --> 03:31:14,129
And it was on a green screen.

2088
03:31:14,129 --> 03:31:17,129
So now it could be used anywhere.

2089
03:31:17,129 --> 03:31:26,440
All right.

2090
03:31:26,440 --> 03:31:29,739
So could some of the mods help me out here?

2091
03:31:29,739 --> 03:31:32,739
I don't know what these are.

2092
03:31:32,739 --> 03:31:40,120
Are there any mods that like know JoJo at all?

2093
03:31:40,120 --> 03:31:48,520
JoJo is embarrassing.

2094
03:31:48,520 --> 03:31:50,520
People, everyone's telling me it is.

2095
03:31:50,520 --> 03:31:51,520
I don't know.

2096
03:31:51,520 --> 03:31:53,520
I know like three JoJo.

2097
03:31:53,520 --> 03:31:58,409
Somebody help me.

2098
03:31:58,409 --> 03:32:01,510
Okay.

2099
03:32:01,510 --> 03:32:02,510
JoJo poses.

2100
03:32:02,510 --> 03:32:05,510
I'm just going to look at a video and try to recreate it.

2101
03:32:05,510 --> 03:32:07,959
Okay.

2102
03:32:07,959 --> 03:32:10,959
Here's the only the best JoJo poses.

2103
03:32:10,959 --> 03:32:20,120
I can't like do half of these.

2104
03:32:20,120 --> 03:32:21,120
All right.

2105
03:32:21,120 --> 03:32:28,629
I'll do this one.

2106
03:32:28,629 --> 03:32:33,620
I need to look at it one more time.

2107
03:32:33,620 --> 03:32:40,940
So this one looks like it goes like this.

2108
03:32:40,940 --> 03:32:44,870
Like that.

2109
03:32:44,870 --> 03:33:00,559
That was awful.

2110
03:33:00,559 --> 03:33:03,729
I thought that was a pros practicing.

2111
03:33:03,729 --> 03:33:25,520
All right.

2112
03:33:25,520 --> 03:33:35,909
Let's pick another one.

2113
03:33:35,909 --> 03:33:36,909
Okay.

2114
03:33:36,909 --> 03:33:37,909
Okay.

2115
03:33:37,909 --> 03:33:42,159
Okay.

2116
03:33:42,159 --> 03:33:43,159
We click this one.

2117
03:33:43,159 --> 03:33:44,159
How does this one work?

2118
03:33:44,159 --> 03:33:50,200
You go like this.

2119
03:33:50,200 --> 03:34:25,969
This is worse than the Raptor.

2120
03:34:25,969 --> 03:34:28,920
Who else?

2121
03:34:28,920 --> 03:34:32,590
All right.

2122
03:34:32,590 --> 03:34:34,590
This one, he turns his hand into like a snake.

2123
03:34:34,590 --> 03:34:38,860
He goes, I'll do this one.

2124
03:34:38,860 --> 03:34:39,860
Oops.

2125
03:34:39,860 --> 03:35:06,250
He goes like, no, it's just look at me.

2126
03:35:06,250 --> 03:35:10,180
Look at me.

2127
03:35:10,180 --> 03:35:13,250
The Imgur link had a bunch more.

2128
03:35:13,250 --> 03:35:14,250
Okay.

2129
03:35:14,250 --> 03:35:16,260
I'm not doing that one.

2130
03:35:16,260 --> 03:35:24,319
I'm not doing the one with the guy puts his dick out.

2131
03:35:24,319 --> 03:35:25,319
What?

2132
03:35:25,319 --> 03:35:26,319
I don't understand.

2133
03:35:26,319 --> 03:35:27,319
Okay.

2134
03:35:27,319 --> 03:35:28,319
What?

2135
03:35:28,319 --> 03:35:29,950
I'll do Mewtwo.

2136
03:35:29,950 --> 03:35:30,950
All right.

2137
03:35:30,950 --> 03:35:33,469
Mewtwo goes like this.

2138
03:35:33,469 --> 03:35:40,079
It's like.

2139
03:35:40,079 --> 03:36:10,120
So that was, that's Mewtwo.

2140
03:36:10,120 --> 03:36:11,120
His fingers are different.

2141
03:36:11,120 --> 03:36:12,120
Okay.

2142
03:36:12,120 --> 03:36:13,120
They go like down too.

2143
03:36:13,120 --> 03:36:14,120
Okay.

2144
03:36:14,120 --> 03:36:44,799
I'll do it.

2145
03:36:44,799 --> 03:36:45,799
He's getting into it.

2146
03:36:45,799 --> 03:36:46,799
All right.

2147
03:36:46,799 --> 03:36:52,399
What do they do?

2148
03:36:52,399 --> 03:36:53,889
The one above Mewtwo.

2149
03:36:53,889 --> 03:37:34,299
He's got like a surprised face and he's like, he's going like left foot out.

2150
03:37:35,479 --> 03:37:47,469
What?

2151
03:37:47,469 --> 03:37:51,200
You got it.

2152
03:37:51,200 --> 03:37:52,200
He dabbed.

2153
03:37:55,200 --> 03:38:07,819
So his feet, one is out like that.

2154
03:38:07,819 --> 03:38:14,180
All right.

2155
03:38:14,180 --> 03:38:16,180
Well, there it is.

2156
03:38:16,180 --> 03:38:18,420
Any more Jojo poses?

2157
03:38:18,420 --> 03:38:31,219
I want, I need one more that people really want and that's it.

2158
03:38:31,219 --> 03:38:33,219
This is like the highest voted thing in the entire poll.

2159
03:38:33,219 --> 03:38:41,870
The point.

2160
03:38:41,870 --> 03:38:44,870
Well, you guys are saying names like I, like I know these characters.

2161
03:38:44,870 --> 03:38:55,579
All right.

2162
03:38:55,579 --> 03:38:56,579
I see the point.

2163
03:38:56,579 --> 03:38:59,799
I'll do the point.

2164
03:38:59,799 --> 03:39:03,489
This one is just like a, a sideways stance with a point.

2165
03:39:03,489 --> 03:39:04,489
He tilts his head down.

2166
03:39:04,489 --> 03:39:06,489
Like this one's a little close.

2167
03:39:06,489 --> 03:39:27,829
It's like.

2168
03:39:27,829 --> 03:39:30,840
It's just Phoenix Wright.

2169
03:39:30,840 --> 03:39:31,840
Okay.

2170
03:39:31,840 --> 03:39:32,840
I'm done.

2171
03:39:32,840 --> 03:39:34,200
I'm done.

2172
03:39:37,760 --> 03:39:39,760
Phoenix Wright.

2173
03:39:39,760 --> 03:39:42,760
It's my favorite Jojo character.

2174
03:39:42,760 --> 03:39:43,760
Oh my God.

2175
03:39:43,760 --> 03:39:45,760
I think somebody gave a hundred dollars.

2176
03:39:45,760 --> 03:39:52,450
I don't have my stream labs really set up here, but Kyra Toby just gave a hundred fucking dollars.

2177
03:39:52,450 --> 03:39:58,110
One hundred.

2178
03:39:58,110 --> 03:40:02,200
Thank you so much Kyra Toby.

2179
03:40:02,200 --> 03:40:05,340
One fucking hundred dollars.

2180
03:40:05,340 --> 03:40:08,030
This is for you Kyra Toby.

2181
03:40:08,030 --> 03:40:15,770
One hundred bits.

2182
03:40:15,770 --> 03:40:27,250
One hundred dollars.

2183
03:40:27,250 --> 03:40:34,190
Bam!

2184
03:40:34,190 --> 03:41:01,280
All right.

2185
03:41:01,280 --> 03:41:02,280
Now delete that.

2186
03:41:02,280 --> 03:41:05,610
How many things need to be deleted from this stream?

2187
03:41:05,610 --> 03:41:08,610
At least like, look at my sweaty ass hair.

2188
03:41:08,610 --> 03:41:14,590
Delete it though.

2189
03:41:14,590 --> 03:41:16,590
After the stream's over.

2190
03:41:16,590 --> 03:41:27,770
I thought I could trust you.

2191
03:41:27,770 --> 03:41:28,770
Oh my God.

2192
03:41:28,770 --> 03:41:29,770
There's like so many subs coming in.

2193
03:41:29,770 --> 03:41:30,770
Are you serious?

2194
03:41:30,770 --> 03:41:32,770
Oh my God.

2195
03:41:32,770 --> 03:41:36,319
Well.

2196
03:41:36,319 --> 03:42:00,430
That was terrible.

2197
03:42:00,430 --> 03:42:01,430
That was terrible.

2198
03:42:01,430 --> 03:42:03,430
Delete that too.

2199
03:42:03,430 --> 03:42:04,670
What does he do?

2200
03:42:04,670 --> 03:42:21,239
I don't know what he does.

2201
03:42:21,239 --> 03:42:27,159
I don't get.

2202
03:42:27,159 --> 03:42:28,159
I don't know what he does.

2203
03:42:28,159 --> 03:42:29,459
He goes like.

2204
03:42:29,459 --> 03:42:35,239
Right?

2205
03:42:35,239 --> 03:42:36,239
Like.

2206
03:42:36,239 --> 03:42:49,069
Okay.

2207
03:42:49,069 --> 03:42:51,069
I'm getting like addicted to the green screen.

2208
03:42:51,069 --> 03:42:56,250
Oh my fucking God.

2209
03:42:56,250 --> 03:42:57,250
Are there people still?

2210
03:42:57,250 --> 03:42:58,250
People are subbing.

2211
03:42:58,250 --> 03:42:59,250
Oh my God.

2212
03:42:59,250 --> 03:43:07,510
Jacket goes on the arm.

2213
03:43:07,510 --> 03:43:36,120
Oh my fucking God.

2214
03:43:36,120 --> 03:43:37,120
There's so many subs coming in.

2215
03:43:37,120 --> 03:43:39,120
This is fucking ridiculous.

2216
03:43:39,120 --> 03:43:44,319
Hey.

2217
03:43:44,319 --> 03:43:45,319
So many subs are coming in.

2218
03:43:45,319 --> 03:43:46,319
Let's do some JoJo dances.

2219
03:43:46,319 --> 03:43:50,379
I'm going to do them all.

2220
03:43:50,379 --> 03:43:52,379
I'm going to do them all.

2221
03:43:52,379 --> 03:44:14,159
He does that.

2222
03:44:14,159 --> 03:44:27,559
Praise the sun.

2223
03:44:27,559 --> 03:44:33,159
Oh my God.

2224
03:44:33,159 --> 03:44:34,159
More.

2225
03:44:34,159 --> 03:44:39,040
More.

2226
03:44:39,040 --> 03:44:40,409
More.

2227
03:44:40,409 --> 03:44:41,409
I don't know if I have any more in me.

2228
03:44:41,409 --> 03:44:42,409
I'm like.

2229
03:44:42,409 --> 03:44:43,409
I'm so exhausted.

2230
03:44:43,409 --> 03:44:45,100
What I put.

2231
03:44:45,100 --> 03:44:46,100
Alright.

2232
03:44:46,100 --> 03:44:47,100
Let me tell you.

2233
03:44:47,100 --> 03:44:48,100
When I put.

2234
03:44:48,100 --> 03:44:51,530
When I put on this jacket to do the fucking weather man.

2235
03:44:51,530 --> 03:44:53,530
I was already out of gas.

2236
03:44:53,530 --> 03:45:03,879
The gas was out of the tank.

2237
03:45:03,879 --> 03:45:05,879
You need to do the dance.

2238
03:45:05,879 --> 03:45:10,889
The dance?

2239
03:45:10,889 --> 03:45:11,889
What dance?

2240
03:45:11,889 --> 03:45:15,920
Kyra told me to give a hundred fucking dollars.

2241
03:45:15,920 --> 03:45:16,920
And then another.

2242
03:45:16,920 --> 03:45:18,290
Oh my God.

2243
03:45:18,290 --> 03:45:19,290
Oh my God.

2244
03:45:19,290 --> 03:45:20,290
I can't even keep up.

2245
03:45:20,290 --> 03:45:22,290
I don't have my like stream labs like available.

2246
03:45:22,290 --> 03:45:27,040
You guys are subbing like fucking crazy.

2247
03:45:27,040 --> 03:45:29,819
Tons of community subs going on.

2248
03:45:29,819 --> 03:45:30,819
Thanks so much guys.

2249
03:45:30,819 --> 03:45:36,770
This dance.

2250
03:45:36,770 --> 03:45:40,639
This one.

2251
03:45:40,639 --> 03:45:41,639
I can't.

2252
03:45:41,639 --> 03:45:42,639
This chats going so fast.

2253
03:45:42,639 --> 03:45:46,559
But let me.

2254
03:45:46,559 --> 03:45:47,559
Oh my God.

2255
03:45:47,559 --> 03:45:52,110
Five more.

2256
03:45:52,110 --> 03:45:53,409
Holy shit.

2257
03:45:53,409 --> 03:45:58,750
I can't.

2258
03:45:58,750 --> 03:45:59,750
I can't.

2259
03:45:59,750 --> 03:46:00,750
I can't.

2260
03:46:00,750 --> 03:46:02,370
Improvise.

2261
03:46:02,370 --> 03:46:06,680
What's my laugh tonight?

2262
03:46:06,680 --> 03:46:07,680
Jesus.

2263
03:46:07,680 --> 03:46:12,989
Dengustown fifty dollars.

2264
03:46:12,989 --> 03:46:14,989
Pocket Pauling fifty dollars.

2265
03:46:14,989 --> 03:46:18,110
Kyra told me a hundred dollars.

2266
03:46:18,110 --> 03:46:20,110
Like a hundred subs.

2267
03:46:20,110 --> 03:46:21,110
Holy shit.

2268
03:46:21,110 --> 03:46:22,729
Alright.

2269
03:46:22,729 --> 03:46:23,729
The Jojo dance.

2270
03:46:23,729 --> 03:46:31,559
Alright.

2271
03:46:31,559 --> 03:46:33,559
Everybody in chat link this dance.

2272
03:46:33,559 --> 03:46:34,559
Because I can't click it.

2273
03:46:34,559 --> 03:46:42,409
Twitchy Pyro just gave fifty dollars.

2274
03:46:42,409 --> 03:46:44,780
Oh my God.

2275
03:46:44,780 --> 03:46:47,299
Alright.

2276
03:46:47,299 --> 03:46:48,299
Let's see what the dance is.

2277
03:46:48,299 --> 03:46:50,559
Alright.

2278
03:46:50,559 --> 03:47:01,659
So let's see.

2279
03:47:01,659 --> 03:47:02,659
I can't.

2280
03:47:02,659 --> 03:47:03,659
This is like a whole thing.

2281
03:47:03,659 --> 03:47:11,469
I'm not going to be able to do this.

2282
03:47:11,469 --> 03:47:16,290
So it goes.

2283
03:47:16,290 --> 03:47:31,680
That's all I got.

2284
03:47:31,680 --> 03:47:40,639
I think everyone's going to be subbed by the end of this.

2285
03:47:40,639 --> 03:47:41,639
Holy shit guys.

2286
03:47:41,639 --> 03:47:44,000
I can't keep up with.

2287
03:47:44,000 --> 03:47:46,000
I don't have any of my stuff here.

2288
03:47:46,000 --> 03:47:47,180
I just have a laptop.

2289
03:47:47,180 --> 03:47:50,000
You guys are fucking amazing though.

2290
03:47:50,000 --> 03:47:51,000
Thank you.

2291
03:47:51,000 --> 03:47:53,069
Hope you guys had fun.

2292
03:47:53,069 --> 03:47:55,069
Because we're getting down to the end here.

2293
03:47:55,069 --> 03:48:07,850
I look forward to whatever you guys do with this.

2294
03:48:07,850 --> 03:48:14,959
The creativity from this community is second to none.

2295
03:48:14,959 --> 03:48:17,959
So I look forward to whatever you guys come up with.

2296
03:48:17,959 --> 03:48:19,959
So let me just while there's still a lot of people.

2297
03:48:19,959 --> 03:48:20,959
Let me talk about this.

2298
03:48:20,959 --> 03:48:25,959
So two weeks from now in two full weeks.

2299
03:48:25,959 --> 03:48:29,959
We're going to sit down and we're going to have a movie night.

2300
03:48:29,959 --> 03:48:32,959
So whatever you do with this footage.

2301
03:48:32,959 --> 03:48:34,959
Whatever you do with it.

2302
03:48:34,959 --> 03:48:36,959
Keep in mind a couple of very important things.

2303
03:48:36,959 --> 03:48:38,959
It has to be at least ten seconds long.

2304
03:48:38,959 --> 03:48:39,959
Ten seconds long.

2305
03:48:39,959 --> 03:48:41,959
So no like up.

2306
03:48:41,959 --> 03:48:43,959
Like we talked about right.

2307
03:48:43,959 --> 03:48:44,959
It's going to be ten seconds.

2308
03:48:44,959 --> 03:48:47,959
Or up to two minutes.

2309
03:48:47,959 --> 03:48:48,959
Nothing more than that.

2310
03:48:48,959 --> 03:48:51,959
If it's more than if it's two oh one.

2311
03:48:51,959 --> 03:48:53,319
It's out.

2312
03:48:53,319 --> 03:48:57,319
So up to two minutes at least ten seconds.

2313
03:48:57,319 --> 03:49:02,329
And these videos are going to be pre-screened.

2314
03:49:02,329 --> 03:49:06,510
So whatever you do with this.

2315
03:49:06,510 --> 03:49:09,510
Keep in mind if it's going to be shown on this stream.

2316
03:49:09,510 --> 03:49:15,819
Then it's going to be pre-screened.

2317
03:49:15,819 --> 03:49:20,819
So that means all potential bullshit that I don't want.

2318
03:49:20,819 --> 03:49:25,360
Obviously shown on stream will be taken care of.

2319
03:49:25,360 --> 03:49:27,360
This is not a contest by the way.

2320
03:49:27,360 --> 03:49:30,629
This is not a contest.

2321
03:49:30,629 --> 03:49:39,510
It's just for fun.

2322
03:49:39,510 --> 03:49:42,940
I just want to do it because it seemed like something fun to do.

2323
03:49:42,940 --> 03:49:43,940
No it's not.

2324
03:49:43,940 --> 03:49:47,440
It's not a contest.

2325
03:49:47,440 --> 03:49:49,440
But if you want to participate.

2326
03:49:49,440 --> 03:49:51,680
If you want to use this footage for something.

2327
03:49:51,680 --> 03:49:56,870
I hope you have fun.

2328
03:49:56,870 --> 03:49:57,870
How about this one?

2329
03:49:57,870 --> 03:50:01,239
How about this one?

2330
03:50:01,239 --> 03:50:11,549
How about Michael Jackson?

2331
03:50:11,549 --> 03:50:16,440
How about Moonwalk too?

2332
03:50:16,440 --> 03:50:25,969
See I went backwards.

2333
03:50:25,969 --> 03:50:28,399
I did it all wrong.

2334
03:50:28,399 --> 03:50:34,139
Oh reenact the gnome video.

2335
03:50:34,139 --> 03:50:47,879
I'm not even going to give you a chance.

2336
03:50:47,879 --> 03:50:48,879
All I said was I'm a gnome.

2337
03:50:48,879 --> 03:50:57,729
I didn't say anything else.

2338
03:50:57,729 --> 03:51:05,200
We said dude of Norman Osborn.

2339
03:51:05,200 --> 03:51:09,870
Peter you're a scientist.

2340
03:51:09,870 --> 03:51:13,000
I'm something of a scientist myself.

2341
03:51:13,000 --> 03:51:18,799
You know I find myself to be something of a scientist myself.

2342
03:51:18,799 --> 03:51:19,799
What?

2343
03:51:19,799 --> 03:51:22,129
Peter!

2344
03:51:22,129 --> 03:51:24,879
I hear you're quite the scientist.

2345
03:51:24,879 --> 03:51:33,100
Well I'm something of a scientist myself.

2346
03:51:33,100 --> 03:51:37,100
Get that in a fucking petri dish motherfucker!

2347
03:51:37,100 --> 03:51:57,280
I'm already editing this.

2348
03:51:57,280 --> 03:52:00,600
Oh somebody said do a fat roll.

2349
03:52:00,600 --> 03:52:01,600
Yeah I will.

2350
03:52:01,600 --> 03:52:04,229
I'm going to get hurt.

2351
03:52:04,229 --> 03:52:06,229
I'll do a fat roll with my fucking sword.

2352
03:52:06,229 --> 03:52:13,590
I'm going to be a Dark Souls character.

2353
03:52:13,590 --> 03:53:02,809
There you go.

2354
03:53:02,809 --> 03:53:03,809
Alright guys.

2355
03:53:03,809 --> 03:53:12,069
Dark Souls emotes.

2356
03:53:12,069 --> 03:53:26,389
TF2 taunts.

2357
03:53:26,389 --> 03:53:27,389
I'll do a scout.

2358
03:53:27,389 --> 03:53:42,559
Hey you're simply keeping track of my hands.

2359
03:53:42,559 --> 03:53:43,860
What?

2360
03:53:43,860 --> 03:53:52,270
What?

2361
03:53:52,270 --> 03:54:09,120
Do it again.

2362
03:54:09,120 --> 03:54:10,120
Do it again.

2363
03:54:10,120 --> 03:54:11,120
Do it again.

2364
03:54:11,120 --> 03:54:14,670
Dark Souls emotes.

2365
03:54:14,670 --> 03:54:15,670
What?

2366
03:54:15,670 --> 03:54:17,360
Alright.

2367
03:54:17,360 --> 03:54:18,360
The sun.

2368
03:54:18,360 --> 03:54:23,180
The very sun is this right?

2369
03:54:23,180 --> 03:54:24,180
Right?

2370
03:54:24,180 --> 03:54:25,180
Like up here?

2371
03:54:25,180 --> 03:54:26,360
I'm doing that right?

2372
03:54:26,360 --> 03:54:57,139
You go look up into your tippy toes alright?

2373
03:54:57,139 --> 03:55:00,750
Hey!

2374
03:55:00,750 --> 03:55:09,989
Hey!

2375
03:55:09,989 --> 03:55:11,610
There you go.

2376
03:55:11,610 --> 03:55:12,610
Very good.

2377
03:55:12,610 --> 03:55:18,399
I did the T-Pose.

2378
03:55:18,399 --> 03:55:22,399
I did like 30 minutes of T-Pose.

2379
03:55:22,399 --> 03:55:30,159
Oh I got it.

2380
03:55:30,159 --> 03:55:34,159
Yeah I already T-Posed.

2381
03:55:34,159 --> 03:55:38,379
Let me actually do some jumps.

2382
03:55:38,379 --> 03:55:43,739
I know a lot of people just like Mario.

2383
03:55:43,739 --> 03:56:10,600
Alright the cereal bowl.

2384
03:56:10,600 --> 03:56:22,530
Where is it?

2385
03:56:22,530 --> 03:56:32,600
No!

2386
03:56:32,600 --> 03:56:40,780
Get away from me with the spoon!

2387
03:56:40,780 --> 03:56:41,780
Don't eat me!

2388
03:56:41,780 --> 03:56:43,659
Don't eat me!

2389
03:56:43,659 --> 03:56:44,659
Don't eat me!

2390
03:56:44,659 --> 03:56:47,370
No!

2391
03:56:47,370 --> 03:56:55,270
No!

2392
03:56:55,270 --> 03:56:56,270
No!

2393
03:56:56,270 --> 03:56:57,270
No please!

2394
03:56:57,270 --> 03:57:00,280
Please don't do it!

2395
03:57:00,280 --> 03:57:10,489
That was me in a cereal bowl trying not to get eaten by a toddler eating cereal.

2396
03:57:11,489 --> 03:57:24,340
I did Toy Story earlier.

2397
03:57:24,340 --> 03:57:25,899
Alright.

2398
03:57:25,899 --> 03:57:26,899
I'm going to get out of here.

2399
03:57:26,899 --> 03:57:28,969
I am exhausted.

2400
03:57:28,969 --> 03:57:39,149
I want to make sure I got everything that I wanted to get.

2401
03:57:39,149 --> 03:57:49,280
The race!

2402
03:57:49,280 --> 03:57:50,280
The scooter!

2403
03:57:50,280 --> 03:58:10,979
Oh my god!

2404
03:58:10,979 --> 03:58:21,440
How do you work this thing?

2405
03:58:21,440 --> 03:58:22,440
I don't know how to work this.

2406
03:58:22,440 --> 03:58:28,579
It just like kicks up right?

2407
03:58:28,579 --> 03:58:31,329
There's some kind of locking mechanism on it.

2408
03:58:31,329 --> 03:58:35,670
Oh there it goes.

2409
03:58:35,670 --> 03:58:44,649
Just like that.

2410
03:58:44,649 --> 03:58:46,649
This is made for a small person.

2411
03:58:46,649 --> 03:58:50,680
I don't know how to ride this.

2412
03:58:50,680 --> 03:59:14,479
Do you see this shaking?

2413
03:59:14,479 --> 03:59:24,159
What's up man?

2414
03:59:24,159 --> 03:59:25,159
Alright one more.

2415
03:59:25,159 --> 03:59:42,450
Big trick.

2416
03:59:42,450 --> 03:59:43,450
There it is.

2417
03:59:43,450 --> 03:59:54,600
You know what I'm saying?

2418
03:59:54,600 --> 04:00:18,879
Alright.

2419
04:00:18,879 --> 04:00:24,659
Fine.

2420
04:00:24,659 --> 04:00:34,729
I'll do the narrow toe run.

2421
04:00:34,729 --> 04:00:40,899
Fine.

2422
04:00:40,899 --> 04:00:41,899
Alright.

2423
04:00:41,899 --> 04:00:42,899
Jump from the tree to tree.

2424
04:00:42,899 --> 04:01:27,469
I made it on the mount.

2425
04:01:27,469 --> 04:01:32,420
What do you have to say now?

2426
04:01:32,420 --> 04:01:33,420
Alright.

2427
04:01:33,420 --> 04:01:45,670
Do the spy crab?

2428
04:01:45,670 --> 04:01:46,670
Alright.

2429
04:01:46,670 --> 04:01:53,729
I'll see you guys later.

2430
04:01:53,729 --> 04:01:56,889
I got to clean up.

2431
04:01:56,889 --> 04:02:06,260
So have fun.

2432
04:02:06,260 --> 04:02:10,319
Good luck.

2433
04:02:10,319 --> 04:02:19,430
