00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:20,710
Hello, my constituents. Welcome to Favour the King. It is I,

2
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:32,229
Gerber985, your king, your ruler. And I just have one thing to say, bonjour. Can we get a

3
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:45,560
bunch of bonjours in the chat, please? Look at the fireworks. What a glorious day it is for

4
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:51,219
favouring your king. Those of you that don't know how this is going to work,

5
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:59,109
uh, this one's actually gonna work. Last time we did this, it was a little bit of a problem.

6
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:09,420
This server is fucking clean. Yes, it's not, it is not the other one. It is not the F word.

7
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:19,750
Somebody just threw me an emerald. People throwing me jewels? I don't want to get rid of this.

8
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,189
Of course you would send jewels to your king. What am I speaking of?

9
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:37,609
What are you getting? The snowballs. There's no snow on this map. How many people are in here?

10
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:45,459
10,000? Is it 8,000 people in this game right now? Something like that. But we have some events to

11
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:50,099
do. We have a lot of things to do today. I ain't just going to run around and let you shoot me

12
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:59,219
with arrows. Not like last time. Wait, there is snow. Oh, there is. Yeah, there is. There's snow

13
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:05,299
here. You're right. Like that. I don't know. That's not enough snow to make snowballs.

14
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:11,050
There's 10,000 people here. There's not enough 10,000. There's not 10,000 people worth of

15
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:17,159
snowballs over there. Anyways, the first thing we're going to do is it's going to be a fucking

16
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:23,099
shit show. You can guarantee yourself that. By the way, welcome to Minecon, right? It's Minecraft

17
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:31,139
Day. Didn't mean to do that at all, actually. That was just an actual coincidence. I had no

18
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:36,310
fucking idea that today was like Minecraft Day. Remember, we were supposed to do this like two,

19
00:02:36,310 --> 00:03:01,669
three weeks ago. This got... Is that your dog? Otto? He was like, let me in. All right, the first

20
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:09,460
thing we're going to do, we're going to kick this off. This is going to be a mess. The first thing

21
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:16,419
that I need to tell you is if you get in this game, you have 10 lives. Once you die 10 times,

22
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:22,939
you're out and you have to re-queue. So try not to die. It's going to be kind of hard.

23
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:29,539
During the course of the next few hours, you're going to see plenty of death. Not from each other

24
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:40,659
either. We'll see. It's a lag. Here comes the lag for so many people in the same spot. Holy shit.

25
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:58,020
It's handling it though. It's actually handling it. Everybody said, nice stream, idiot. It's client

26
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,500
lag. It's because the game was never supposed to allow you to have 5 million people in the same

27
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:13,719
spot. But anyway, nice fucking stream. Honk, honk. All right. Anyways, the first thing we're going to

28
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:17,959
do, let's get the first thing started. Everybody in the server... By the way, if you want to play,

29
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:26,649
it's Jermaf.tk in the Minecraft client. You got to have Java. Java client, not the Windows client,

30
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:38,550
not the Switch client. Got to be the Java client. And once you do that, you'll be put into a queue.

31
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,110
When somebody dies in this server in this game, they'll be knocked out. You'll take their place.

32
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:52,180
So let's get started. You get 10 lives. I wish you all well. The first thing we're going to do

33
00:04:52,180 --> 00:05:06,949
is build. What the fuck was that? I didn't do that. I didn't do that. I mean, I can do that.

34
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:20,019
I have this thing. I'm going to get a good look at this. What version? 1.8.8 through 1.16. You

35
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:33,819
can join any of those. Who's driving the ice cream truck in the background? I can do that.

36
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:42,259
Can I? I think my stick of lightning is broken. I can no longer cast lightning. Lightning just

37
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:51,259
strikes randomly in the fucking server. All right. So the first thing we're going to do,

38
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:54,139
we're going to build. Everyone's going to get blocks in their inventory.

39
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:58,629
You're only going to get 10 blocks. You all have to make a statue of your king.

40
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:07,620
If you place a block, it's there forever. You cannot have them be destroyed. They cannot be

41
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,430
picked back up. You want to build me a statue. Forget about the lightning.

42
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:22,009
Why is it the flag of Italy? That's like the Aquafresh logo. What are you talking about?

43
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:30,470
Italy. All right. Are we ready? Are we ready to start? Are we confirmed that we're ready to

44
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:34,550
begin the build process where you have to build me a statue? Work together.

45
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:55,350
Please, your king. Please. For the love of God. Minecraft sucks. Don't say that on Minecraft day.

46
00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:17,269
You guys ready? I'm going to fly away for a second. Here comes the build. Here's the thing.

47
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:23,100
If you guys make anything that's phallic shaped, it's getting deleted. I'll just delete it. I'll

48
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:31,480
just delete it. Are you supposed to build with all the client lag? I don't know. Good luck.

49
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:45,910
Why is this pre-recorded? It's not. I'm right here, dude. It looks like mafia graphics.

50
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:51,800
Yeah. From my perspective, it's going to be lagging, but not from other perspectives. Don't

51
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:58,199
worry. This is like 10 FPS. Yeah, it is because we're capturing it through something else. But

52
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:04,410
my perspective doesn't matter. We're going to switch. Don't worry. Don't worry. Am I hosting

53
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:29,449
the server? No. Wait, what? I am not hosting the server. Am I like garage? Everything is lagging.

54
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:45,899
Well, don't worry. Once we do the actual events and we let the server rest, it's going to be fine.

55
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:51,259
Did I get a better computer? Oh, this is running over the course of,

56
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:56,360
I think there's like 10 servers. I think there's like 15 servers this is running on right now.

57
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:11,929
Grab a Scott burger? Yes. I haven't had it yet, but what is it? Lettuce, tomato,

58
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:16,259
ketchup, mustard, mushrooms, onions, ketchup, mustard, and bacon. Something like that.

59
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:35,850
I see a five. My five is not the problem. It's running at two frames per second. Oh, that's

60
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:50,220
weird. All right. We have a solution. We have a solution. Hey, look at me. Welcome to technical

61
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:58,059
difficulties. We're going to, we have to restart the server and it'll be fixed when we restart it.

62
00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:05,000
We have to cut the player count by like a hundred people. All right, let's go. Turn it off. Put us

63
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,399
on the BRB screen. We'll be right back. Hey, last time we started the stream two hours late,

64
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:13,720
I was here on time at 301 with technical difficulties. Just cut it. We'll be back in

65
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,610
10 seconds. I was two and a half hours late last FTK. It's only been 15 minutes. Everybody

66
00:10:19,610 --> 00:15:33,049
chill in your seats and relax. We'll be back in 10 minutes. Hey dude, is it your VPN? No,

67
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:42,740
no, that was a joke. Hi. Hi everybody. Hey, how's everybody doing? It's me, laggy. Somebody said,

68
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:49,610
and I will give you this. I'll give you credit. Somebody said, bod watchers skip 30 minutes. Yeah.

69
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:59,980
All right. You sure you get it. You get that one. I hadn't even been 30 minutes yet though.

70
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:10,570
Okay. So I think we are ready to start. Keep in mind the first person view for me or inventory

71
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:19,429
purposes is going to be, it's a lower frame rate. Everything else should not be. Yes. You know what?

72
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:23,590
Just skip 10 minutes. If you get involved right now, just go 10 minutes from now. You'll look,

73
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:28,070
you'll see it. You'll be happy. You should have listened to that one guy like 25 minutes ago. He

74
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:36,340
was right. All right. Everybody's going to get blocks placed in their inventory and you are going

75
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:43,529
to be looking at it. It says, look at how clean this is. You're in a windows destruction. Everybody

76
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:49,750
has blocks in the inventory. I want a statue. I want a statue built of me. Place those blocks.

77
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:59,269
They do not come up when you place them. So don't fuck it up. Here. Look, I'll get you started.

78
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:02,870
Oh shit. I can't. Can I put, can I pick that back up? Look, I'll start it.

79
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:16,970
Watch out for the flowers. They can't be, the flowers can't be removed. All right. Go. You only

80
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:50,460
get 10. Why would you go straight up, dude? The stream is in 1080p. Nice 2008 YouTube video.

81
00:17:55,220 --> 00:18:18,220
This just looks like a level in like Super Mario sunshine. This is not a statue. This is,

82
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:38,789
why does this guy have dirt? Unregistered hyper cam. This is not a statue. You guys got it all

83
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:45,769
wrong. What? Whoa. That's actually pretty sick. Wow. That's actually kind of good.

84
00:18:46,410 --> 00:19:05,289
Uh, this is supposed to be a statue of me, not what it feels like to step on a Lego

85
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:14,019
water. I just spit, I spit fucking water everywhere right there. I spit out so much.

86
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:33,130
You're a pause to buffer. What? What do you mean pause? How's that? Is that, is that better? Oh

87
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:44,089
shit. Be careful. You can die. You can die. You can die. I can hear the CPU fans from here.

88
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:05,380
Yeah. It's all what you're seeing is, is what happens when hundreds of people are in the same

89
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:10,170
spot. It's all client side lag that it will even out once we do the next couple of events. Don't

90
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:26,940
worry. Such dog shit. People are just writing fuck. I don't know. Let me, let me, let me,

91
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:32,119
I gotta be honest with you. I don't know why I want so badly to be have like a collaborative

92
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:38,700
statue build. This is the kind of shit that those little weird guys used to make in Fraggle Rock.

93
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:45,460
This is not even like a statue. Oh, I want to build a statue. That's never going to fucking

94
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:57,480
happen with like hundreds of people in the same place ever. This is absolutely dream fixed.

95
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:10,900
Oh, we got a POG moment here. It's fixed. Look at that. All right. Keep going.

96
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:19,430
Everybody said, Hey, dog shit stream. Hey, whatever. What would it say? We're good. We're

97
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:27,829
good. We're good. Look at this. We're good. Hey, I told you it was going to take 30 minutes. I told

98
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:33,450
you everybody, everybody. Why is somebody started fire? This is not going to work. The build section

99
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:36,869
is going to be stupid. Like it was always going to be stupid. Somebody started. I'm just trying

100
00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:44,890
to burn it down now. Wait, actually are you making arms? Oh shit. You actually are making arms.

101
00:21:44,890 --> 00:22:04,819
How do we stop them? Well, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. I did. It's burning.

102
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:14,170
I don't know. Okay. In my dreams last night, I was lying there going like, oh man, they're

103
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:18,569
going to build when people work together, like Twitch plays Pokemon, Twitch plays the carnival

104
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:24,390
make a statue. Yeah. And I could see the arms being built in the head and the face.

105
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:35,400
They're probably going to do like a funny like face. No, this is just a series of lines up and

106
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:44,819
down and I keep striking it with lightning. That's too wishful thinking. Yeah. Expectation versus

107
00:22:44,819 --> 00:23:01,430
reality. Like you, I'm going to, I'm going to cut, I'm going to call this in about two minutes.

108
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:11,079
I'm going to move on to event number two out of like 30. Oh, I got to change. How do I turn

109
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:21,819
clouds off? All right. Clouds off. All right. So let me get a good view of this. Nice. Yeah,

110
00:23:21,819 --> 00:23:31,529
just good. Very good. It's just that this is not what I thought. Well, this is not what I saw in

111
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:40,869
my dream. Can somebody please build like, hold on. We, somebody's got, we got something going on up

112
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:59,559
here. Good statue of just cobblestone. This is, this is a randomly generated structure.

113
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:07,000
Like Google AI from 1998 made this and it was astonishing back in the late 90s. Like,

114
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:18,059
holy shit. Did you see what Google AI 2000 just did? I want everyone to be very aware of something.

115
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:26,180
This is the warmup. This is the warmup. The first two little events here are a very small warmup

116
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:30,940
just to get the server running and everything's gone. You ain't seen nothing yet. Don't be

117
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:37,220
fucking worried. Yeah. All right. I think, I think it's time to call the statue here. I mean,

118
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:44,390
this is, this look, this is terrible. Don't you feel like you're going to drop a coin in

119
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:49,349
the top of this thing and it's going to be a cool display to see where it goes. And then you get the

120
00:24:49,349 --> 00:25:01,559
gumball at the end. I mean, that's kind of cool. I guess I don't know what people are getting lava.

121
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:08,069
Where are people getting lava and water? How does somebody already have lava? Server's been

122
00:25:08,069 --> 00:25:16,490
off for like five seconds. Wait, somebody wrote the word ass when he said cock. All right. I have

123
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:28,410
to turn off the chat for me. I got to turn that off. Where does it turn it off? It's just a bucket.

124
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:33,339
All right. What's, what does it say? This is on fire. This is pretty cool. Not a statue,

125
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:41,349
but it's just pain. Okay. I see. So far so good. Dude, you're standing in there.

126
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,440
I even hurt people with my stick of absolute lightning.

127
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:55,509
All right. That's pretty good. You guys want to move on to the second, second event.

128
00:25:55,509 --> 00:26:09,380
You've made it a great, a great thing here. Oh, it's done. It's done. It's over. It's done.

129
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:23,160
This statue is done. Otto smile. I guess the kind of is like a face down here. It's one of those

130
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:33,299
like Mario mushrooms up there. All right. I would like everybody to follow me. Thank you

131
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:37,619
for participating in the build event. Why do I think I could go through the fucking front door?

132
00:26:37,619 --> 00:26:44,920
Thanks for participating in the build event, everybody. That was really fun. We're going to

133
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:52,599
move on now to the second event here, which is going to be a POG event. You can follow me,

134
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:56,150
everybody. Everyone in the server, please. We're going to go over to the Coliseum and we're going

135
00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:04,019
to start the tournament. It's going to be a tournament between people in here heading over

136
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:16,039
to the Coliseum. It's a POGChamp event. You're free to say POGChamp if you want to. Follow me

137
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:24,779
to the Coliseum. Otto, you want to go inside? He's like, let me in, let me out, let me in,

138
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:34,920
let me out. Take a look at this. Who are going to enter one at a time, you will fight to the death.

139
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:44,710
Those of you that remain will be tiered based on how many people you've killed. And don't even

140
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:52,549
try to go down here because you can't. You can. You can't. You cannot. There you go. Don't even

141
00:27:52,549 --> 00:28:00,859
try. You can't. I really wonder how this is going to play out. I don't think this is going to play

142
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:07,930
the way that we think it is. So two enter. Wait, people can just jump up? You can't go in though.

143
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:19,450
Good luck. It's just a glass ceiling. No, the tournament's not just everybody go in here and

144
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:25,460
just start killing each other. That's not the tournament. He's training. Wait, somebody's dead.

145
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:42,539
Wait, what? No, it's the tournament. Don't kill each other. Why are people on fire? This is the

146
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:47,420
tournament. If you die 10 times, by the way, you're fucking out of here. I need to make that very

147
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:56,660
clear. If you type slash duel, you are going to be queued up to be participating down there. It looks

148
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:07,140
like we got somebody already there. Who's there? I can't even see their name. I'm going to queue up

149
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:18,470
and fight this guy. Is he fighting anybody? Is somebody else even down there? Dick Daschle

150
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:28,579
Richard versus who? Wait, why are we all flying blocks? Who is he fighting? There's no one. Oh,

151
00:29:28,579 --> 00:29:33,130
wait, here we go. Yep. Okay. Okay. Okay. Here we go. Let's go. Come on. Dick Daschle Richard

152
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:48,500
versus 847. I don't know. That's not what the fuck that number is. Are they fighting? All right.

153
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:54,259
You guys got to fight. Fight to the death. Let's go. I guess what if they just don't fight?

154
00:29:57,049 --> 00:30:07,960
This guy has a sword. Well, why did you queue up for the duel if you didn't have anything to

155
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:17,990
fight with? I think he's going to win. Does this guy have armor too? Why does this guy have armor?

156
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:33,829
Who's he fighting at? Why is he swinging at us? He thought he was going to be supplied. Oh,

157
00:30:33,829 --> 00:30:39,849
wait, there's people spawning. Where did this guy come from? Can't join. Can't join. Well,

158
00:30:39,849 --> 00:30:51,910
the server's probably full right now. No one can connect to the server. It's probably because

159
00:30:52,309 --> 00:31:05,369
it's full, right? Why are we all ghosts? Wait, hold on. Peter Griffin just saved the stream

160
00:31:05,369 --> 00:31:22,119
because he showed up. People being kicked? Why are we all like floating around as ghosts? Hold

161
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:41,819
on. I'll tell him I should go outside. One sec. Come here. No, wait, the server's down.

162
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:59,589
Connection lost. Oh shit. The whole thing is down. Wait, is it actual next duel? This is the most

163
00:31:59,589 --> 00:32:11,700
interesting thing I've ever seen. Why is everybody's heads just floating around as ghosts? I don't

164
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:38,890
remember seeing this before. This is insane. It's just spectator mode. Oh, okay. Oh, I'm getting

165
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:54,680
something in my ear. All right, so there's too many people in spectator mode, which is crashing

166
00:32:54,680 --> 00:33:00,009
the whole client. All right, let's just move on to the main event. No more stalling. Let's move on

167
00:33:00,009 --> 00:33:06,309
to the main event. Let's do the main event. The main event is going to take like three hours,

168
00:33:06,309 --> 00:33:09,990
and none of this shit will happen in the main event. I just wanted to give some padding.

169
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:18,150
There was supposed to be a little tournament, but there's 50 trillion people here.

170
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:34,099
Worse than Bugleberry. Yeah, it's all right. Yeah, it is. It's worse. That's fine. We wanted to fight.

171
00:35:31,800 --> 00:37:14,579
Hello. Hi. Welcome back. Okay, if a stream is the worst stream of 2020, guaranteed,

172
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:18,420
we can remove it from the list, right? Like everything else is an honorable mention at this

173
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:27,610
point, right? Like this could just sit as like the worst stream of 2020. And then, you know,

174
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:34,440
we can vote on another one. That's fair, right? That's fair. That's fair, right?

175
00:37:36,099 --> 00:37:43,460
No, we all agree. All right, I agree. We all agree. So what's the point of having to vote for it?

176
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:48,409
It's already stamped it. Throw it up. All right, here we go. We are going to move on.

177
00:37:49,050 --> 00:38:02,280
We're going to try to do the actual main event of this stream. Oh, no. It's dead.

178
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:19,719
I'm going to put in Rattatouille quick. Should I open up the Rattatouille level?

179
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:31,260
I just, I can't. I'm not even streaming. Did you believe that? Emergency Rattatouille stream

180
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:50,630
incoming. Imagine, imagine the FTK stream becomes emergency Rattatouille stream.

181
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:59,139
Holy shit. That might be the most ridiculous thing ever. All right, we're going to try this again.

182
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:04,579
There's so much cool shit in this. There's so much. It's so much cool shit in this. You have

183
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:09,139
no idea, guys. We just wait. You got to see it. All right, we just have to see it. It's fucking

184
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:18,860
awesome. All right, we just got to get there. Do another Diablo 2 playthrough. Okay. Yeah,

185
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:41,139
maybe. All right, I'm in. Are we, are we good to go? Are we good to try? Go play Genshin Impact.

186
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:56,519
I don't even know what that is, but maybe. No, don't. You just said two words back to back.

187
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:07,750
I don't even know what they were. You said Genshin and then Impact. Please do, please do. I don't

188
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:25,559
even know what it is. It's a gotcha game. I don't know what it is. I don't know. Does somebody have

189
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:35,429
this up? Does that, does your skin say stream sucks? Oh, no. Germa sucks. Okay. All right. Hey,

190
00:40:35,429 --> 00:40:41,429
we're going to try to do this. We're going to try to start this. Everybody pretend to be excited.

191
00:40:41,429 --> 00:40:47,960
Everybody pretend to be floored by this coming up. All right. You ready? We're going to act.

192
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:54,599
This is acting class 101. Whoa, what the hell? Whoa, there's a dragon. Quick to the battlements.

193
00:40:55,239 --> 00:41:00,710
Get yourselves a bow and arrow and some kind of, we're being attacked. The tournament has been

194
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:11,610
interrupted by a dragon. Hurry to the armaments. My inventory is full of dog shit. I don't want

195
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:23,460
any of this stuff. I need a bow and arrow. Oh, you can. We have to, we have to defeat this dragon.

196
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:34,090
Quickly to your king. Why do I have apples in my fucking. Apples and shit. Throwing snowballs.

197
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:43,690
This is the Argent tournament. Wow. Reference. Shut up. This is a lot of time.

198
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:52,360
All right, let's go. I got my bow and arrow. I need arrows. I need to actually need an arrow.

199
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,039
You only need one arrow. It's a magical bow.

200
00:41:56,199 --> 00:42:11,739
Kill him. Excellent work. Excellent work. Watch out for the boss. Oh, shoot. He's killed like five

201
00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:18,760
people. All right, we did it. Victory. The dragon has gone into hiding. Would you look at that? What

202
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:25,480
a surprise that would have been if it happened in the middle of a fucking tournament. Holy shit,

203
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:36,969
a lot of people died. Look at all this stuff on the ground. Jesus Christ. All right, here we go.

204
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:42,969
Wait, let's, let's go back to the town. What do you say? You guys think, let's go, let's go back.

205
00:42:42,969 --> 00:42:45,769
Let's go back to the town. Let's get, let's, let's get this shit figured out.

206
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:59,719
That dragon just attacked the town. Tournamental. Oh, I sense something strange. I don't know about

207
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:11,880
any of you guys, but I, I sense something strange happening in the air. Real tragedy. What? All right,

208
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:20,309
let's head back. Anybody else sense something? Especially potentially somebody on the production

209
00:43:20,309 --> 00:43:30,679
staff might sense where direction I should be heading. I don't know where it is. Where is it?

210
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:37,480
Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where's the thing that I have to touch?

211
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:54,619
My dream. I was like sleeping going, oh wow. The dragon attacks and there's a statue and wow.

212
00:43:56,230 --> 00:44:05,909
Hey, where's this thing that I have to touch guy on production staff? Help me. That didn't happen in

213
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:19,590
my dream last night for this game. Where, where actually is it though? This is okay. Okay. When

214
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:25,750
you're like a little kid and you, in your mind, you have this elaborate thing play out the way

215
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:31,769
that you're talking the way. Whoa, wait, hold on. What's that? Hey fellas, fellas, I found it.

216
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:55,099
Hey fellas, I found it. What's this over here? There's a cave system over here. Look out. The

217
00:44:55,099 --> 00:45:06,760
dragon escaped. Come back to the Coliseum and check it out. Something happened here. Why is

218
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:16,090
everybody listening to me? The only person over here. I'm just playing it alone. Is anybody

219
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:32,780
listening? Oh, oh, oh my chest. That's so sad, but funny at the same time. No one's listening to me.

220
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:51,699
Oh, we are here for Steve. I see people. I see people. Wait, I gotta go in. I want experiences

221
00:45:51,699 --> 00:45:58,409
too. I want to see this. I'm on fire. Why am I in fire? How do I put myself out? I'm on fire.

222
00:45:58,409 --> 00:46:12,760
All right, boys. I'm on fire. All right, everybody quick into the, into the portal.

223
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:17,530
Okay. What I was going to say is you know, when you're like a little kid and you inside of your

224
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:23,980
head, when you're like 10, 11, 12 years old and you just see and hear this elaborate thing that

225
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:29,449
you're making up, like you have a dragon flying by in your head and you're fighting with a sword

226
00:46:29,449 --> 00:46:36,250
outside. It's like recess or whatever. And it's like real life out there. That's how I felt it

227
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:40,780
was going to be. But like in reality, when like the teachers look out the window to recess, they

228
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:46,539
see like two like little shits just like moving around in circles, going like dragon. Look out

229
00:46:46,539 --> 00:46:54,860
for the dragon. But in their head, it's like a fucking movie. That's how I felt today.

230
00:46:57,619 --> 00:47:02,260
Anyways, welcome. Uh, we're in some kind of dungeon right now. I think we need to

231
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:10,789
find our way out of this fucking dungeon. We need to go find the king's sword.

232
00:47:12,619 --> 00:47:22,659
I can't even, we're on an RP right now. Find the king's sword at recess. Everybody in.

233
00:47:26,809 --> 00:47:32,139
You got to get it one at a time. Not too many people go in the hot tub. Be careful. You can

234
00:47:32,139 --> 00:47:39,960
die in here. This actually is dangerous in here. Be careful. We got to make our way and find the

235
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:49,559
king's sword. Careful. Careful. What the hell? What, what the hell is that? All right. There's

236
00:47:49,559 --> 00:48:00,550
like a super creeper over here. Kill it. It's like Harry Potter. It's the creeper king.

237
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:11,530
Oh shit. Fuck that. Is this the new update? No, no, it's not. No, it's not. This is Minecraft

238
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:29,739
1.8.9. Someone feed in the pool. Kill this thing. Wait, can we hurt this thing? He's kind of just

239
00:48:29,739 --> 00:48:41,219
looking at people. It's going to explode. The pool is closed. No, the pool is open. You just

240
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:51,269
got to go in it. Oh no, I see what's happening. People are killing each other. This guy has a

241
00:48:51,269 --> 00:49:01,300
weapon. Don't fight each other. Fight the creeper king. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

242
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:17,619
We're supposed to be working together. Did anybody even hurt him? Is he just an NPC for fun? I think

243
00:49:17,619 --> 00:49:22,230
he's invincible. Do we need to do anything in particular? Do we need to like dump like water

244
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:26,309
on him or something? People are trying to leave. I think we have to kill this thing. How do we kill

245
00:49:26,309 --> 00:49:34,599
it? Oh shit, he's on fire. Wait, wait, wait. Shoot him with arrows. He's not even trying to hurt

246
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:51,369
anybody. I think I just headshot somebody and killed them. Well, what was that? Where the

247
00:49:51,369 --> 00:50:09,559
explosion? I can't even tell if we're hurting him. This guy just lives here. We're just like

248
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:24,869
fucking up his whole house. I think there's explosions too. Oh, I think we have to hit the

249
00:50:24,869 --> 00:50:49,159
bottom part. Hit the bottom part? Where is he? He kind of blends in with people that have diamond

250
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:55,539
armor on. Wait, there's two of them. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. There are two of these guys?

251
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:09,559
What? This guy's bigger. Oh shit. Oh my God. I'm going to die. Oh fuck. All right. I'm going

252
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:29,860
this way. Who's like a friend or foe? Shit. I'm sorry. What that was? I literally just headshot

253
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:44,630
somebody and killed him. How much health does he have? RDM. There's so many arrows everywhere too.

254
00:51:44,630 --> 00:52:01,420
This is fucking ridiculous. No one snowballs at him. That's not going to work. Is he dead?

255
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:11,300
I'm going to die in a second. I'm dead. Oh shit. Why do I have 10 lives? I'm supposed to have a

256
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:18,389
thousand. Oh my fucking God. This stuff all over the floor. I don't even know what I picked up.

257
00:52:18,389 --> 00:52:36,059
What happened? I'm naked. Do I still? Oh shit. Is he spawned? No, I don't. Nine lives. That's not

258
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:56,329
I'm flying around. Shit. Someone has my lightning stick. Oh fuck they do. Somebody has the stick.

259
00:52:56,329 --> 00:53:08,980
That's why. That's what lightning strikes are. Somebody took it. All right. I died.

260
00:53:14,179 --> 00:53:17,460
I can put, I can turn on God mode, but I don't think I need it. How much? Hey,

261
00:53:18,659 --> 00:53:54,900
how much health mods? Somebody said somebody has this sound way up. How do we kill this guy?

262
00:53:56,019 --> 00:54:07,130
Why is there an Enderman in here? Does anybody have a weapon I can borrow? Why don't I have a

263
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:26,119
fucking weapon? Do it louder please. Is there, is there audio to turn down? There we go. Do we

264
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:42,260
know how much health this guy has? I feel like we're playing Destiny. Destiny 3. Shit. I died

265
00:54:42,260 --> 00:55:10,440
again. I'm killing this motherfucker right now. How do I do it? I'm in God mode. Let's kill this

266
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:23,800
motherfucker. I'm going to hit him up. Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill. I can't PvP here.

267
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:50,309
No phase. I can't, I can't even hurt him. Fix the Q. Is the Q server fucked up? Yes it is.

268
00:55:52,570 --> 00:56:04,789
Uh, they're saying the Q server is fucked up. Game server's all right. You can TP to people? You

269
00:56:04,789 --> 00:56:18,150
can. All right. How do we instantly kill this guy? How do we kill this thing? We're just like

270
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:30,039
bullying this fucking creeper. German, just swallow your pride and play Ratatouille.

271
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:55,619
Look, it works. We're in. Well, I'm staying. How did everybody get all this diamond armor?

272
00:56:55,619 --> 00:57:03,909
All right. Let's move. He's dead. He's been killed. We got to go through this through here.

273
00:57:05,829 --> 00:57:30,539
I'd kill all. Where's the next room? Oh, it's all the way back here. Am I looking the right way?

274
00:57:30,539 --> 00:57:36,199
I actually can't believe this many people are in here right now. So all the way to the back wall

275
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:53,699
here. Oh, here we go. All right. Follow me in next room. We're going to find that sword.

276
00:57:54,949 --> 00:57:58,230
Wait, easy, easy. Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow. Don't go so fast.

277
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:16,550
I can't see anything. There's too many people. It's a giant maze. There's too many people in here.

278
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:27,300
There's too many. I'm fucking claustrophobic right now. I actually kind of like it. You can't

279
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:40,500
break it. We've got to, somebody's got to find the exit. It's a maze. All right. Split up, split up.

280
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:49,260
Don't all go the same way. We have to split up. Is there a fucking, is there an enderman in here too?

281
00:58:51,670 --> 00:59:01,079
All right. Split up, split up. We've got to find the exit. Does somebody have an enderman skin?

282
00:59:01,719 --> 00:59:17,719
All right. Good. Progress, progress, progress. I see name plates everywhere. Good. Spread out,

283
00:59:17,719 --> 00:59:39,079
spread as far out as you can. That way? No? Let's go this way. Why am I seeing omega lulls right now?

284
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:48,219
Why is everybody laughing? I see omega lull, omega lull, omega lull, omega lull.

285
00:59:48,219 --> 00:59:56,860
Really? You put a maze in here? You're insane. I think there's like a couple. Good luck. Yeah,

286
00:59:56,860 --> 01:00:05,179
it's not nothing. This is some fucking hard shit here. All right. We have to be getting close to

287
01:00:05,179 --> 01:00:30,389
the end. I hear the enderman. I feel like we're making really good progress. Ice cream Hong Kong.

288
01:00:30,389 --> 01:00:38,420
Yeah. All right. I've watched Beetlejuice too. It was a funny movie. Oh, wait. There's a bottleneck

289
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:46,650
here. One at a time. Progress towards what? Towards, we get towards the exit. We're going

290
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:59,670
to go through the dungeon. How far, how, how much progress have we made? Anybody on production want

291
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:14,599
to tell me? Curious, I wonder. Black Friday POV. Get in there. I got to get a new Wii.

292
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:25,420
How, how far are we? Oh, we're, we're good. We're, we're halfway, like almost halfway there.

293
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:42,969
Oh, I told you splitting up was a good idea. Oh, I, I just turned around. I got turned around.

294
01:01:42,969 --> 01:01:49,500
Wait, am I going the wrong way? Oh shit. Wait, where? I was going the right way,

295
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:55,159
but then I got turned around. I have no idea. Oh, stop whispering me that shit. All right.

296
01:01:55,719 --> 01:02:08,820
Time to ban that person. Q server limits 400 right now. Could be a lot more than that.

297
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:14,760
Is this the wrong way? Oh shit. Hold on. Guys, we're going the wrong way. Wrong way. Wrong,

298
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:23,820
wrong, wrong, wrong. Turn around. Yeah. If you're not in the maze, by the way, guys,

299
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:29,179
if you're not in this current room, if you, if you type slash die, you're going to lose a life,

300
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:33,019
but you will end up at the beginning of the maze. So if you're all the way back and like,

301
01:02:33,019 --> 01:02:40,730
oh shit, I can't fucking go anywhere. You do slash die. You will end up at the beginning

302
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:49,059
of the maze. Shit. All right. I got to pay attention. Am I going with this? People are

303
01:02:49,059 --> 01:03:03,369
walking forward backwards. Oh fuck. Is anybody, is anybody close? Once somebody beats it, we all

304
01:03:03,369 --> 01:03:20,699
win. This way, this way, this way. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Go, go, go, go, go. I'm so close.

305
01:03:20,699 --> 01:03:30,010
Keep going. Yeah. Yeah. Shit. I thought the turn, I'm turning chat off like fucking Wally. All

306
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:40,710
right. I got to turn this off. Somebody said that. Why did I read that shit? God damn it.

307
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:49,940
All right. Wrong way. Wrong way. Wrong way. Turn around. I feel like we're just ants.

308
01:03:51,019 --> 01:03:54,860
Isn't this how ants work? One ant picks the direction and lays down like ant fluid and

309
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:59,510
all the other ants follow the ant fluid. Who's the lead ant right now? Somebody has to be lead ant.

310
01:04:01,369 --> 01:04:04,969
All right. Why don't you take over lead ant? It's not going to be me. Somebody take over. I'm going

311
01:04:05,929 --> 01:04:17,929
to bless one of you. All right. I can't see. How about, all right. Scales. Scales 7744.

312
01:04:17,929 --> 01:04:28,599
Wow. That's the new lead ant. Everybody follow him. He's got like a green t-shirt and jeans on.

313
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:40,219
Follow a guy with the green shirt on. You know where you're going? Is somebody there?

314
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:49,110
Did somebody do it? Oh, they, somebody got, somebody got really close and then they,

315
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:54,250
they turned around and got fucked up. Shit. Oh my God. All right. This way.

316
01:04:54,969 --> 01:05:02,090
I don't even know if I'm going the right direction or not. I think we just want to circle.

317
01:05:06,219 --> 01:05:24,260
Oh my God. Okay. Over here and then right. Yep. Right here. Okay. And then, and then this way

318
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:38,119
and then left. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Follow Tingy. Tingy's got it. Tingy's got it.

319
01:05:38,119 --> 01:05:41,400
Welcome to, by the way, welcome to Minecraft day, everybody. Didn't know that was today.

320
01:05:46,630 --> 01:06:02,570
Minecon 2020. Oh no. I just got, I just got word in my ear, guys, that we are going the 100%

321
01:06:02,570 --> 01:06:07,050
wrong direction. We turned around and went the wrong way. We're running backwards now.

322
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:18,539
Uh, not going the right way at all. Back this way. All right. I'm going to give this 10 more

323
01:06:18,539 --> 01:06:34,219
minutes, five more minutes before I start taking balls down. Holy shit. That guy's huge. What

324
01:06:34,219 --> 01:06:51,900
happened to the one guy that was almost done? See, is he still getting close? Is everybody just

325
01:06:51,900 --> 01:07:02,219
hopelessly lost? This is just a way to keep us busy. Somebody said career ending stream.

326
01:07:04,019 --> 01:07:21,019
Oh, whatever. That was a good run. Sir, you are fired. That's all right. It was pretty good.

327
01:07:21,019 --> 01:07:32,489
It was pretty fun. He's talking about me. All right. I'm taking balls down. I'm taking balls

328
01:07:32,489 --> 01:07:34,809
down. I want to go to the next room. I want to go, I don't want to do this anymore. I want to go to

329
01:07:34,809 --> 01:07:47,349
the next room. How do I do this? Too hard. I don't know where we're going. Nobody knows where they're

330
01:07:47,349 --> 01:08:08,500
going. Okay. So I'm just going to start taking walls down. I don't have a pickaxe. What? I need

331
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:30,699
a pickaxe. Somebody give me a pickaxe. I can't break walls. Can I actually not cheat? Oh shit.

332
01:08:30,699 --> 01:08:33,579
All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Hopefully I'm facing the

333
01:08:33,579 --> 01:08:48,010
right direction. Oh shit. I fell through the world. Oh no. Please tell me you can see this.

334
01:08:48,569 --> 01:09:23,880
I'm killing everybody. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No. No. I'm sorry. I tried. I tried. I killed like 10

335
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:36,840
people. 20 people at least just died. All right. Don't look at the ground and hit the ground.

336
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:41,399
All right. Wait. I made it to the end of the maze. I made it to the end of the maze guys.

337
01:09:41,399 --> 01:10:01,060
I did it. Pog. Look. Oh shit. Hold on. I gotta change this. All right. Come on in. Look where I

338
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:10,489
am. Hey. I made it to the end of the maze guys. Is anybody even close? Nobody's even remotely

339
01:10:10,489 --> 01:10:20,300
close. Why is somebody on top? All right. If you hit slash die, you're going to come to me.

340
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:31,699
Put it on easy mode. Yeah. I kind of did, didn't I? What's the next room? There's a bear in here.

341
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:49,449
All right. Careful. Careful. Careful. Careful. This is a jumping map. The queue thinks that

342
01:10:49,449 --> 01:10:53,850
there's four. Well, there is only 400 people in the server. How the queue system works is it pulls

343
01:10:53,850 --> 01:11:00,810
you in when somebody else here dies. You'll be in the queue until somebody here is gone. At least

344
01:11:00,810 --> 01:11:05,579
that's how it's kind of supposed to work. Oh, there goes somebody. Okay. Okay. This is a jump

345
01:11:05,579 --> 01:11:17,539
map. Be careful. Let us out. There's only two. Oh, the server. Okay. Right. The server thinks

346
01:11:17,539 --> 01:11:24,300
there's 400 people. I see. I see what you're saying. So the server, the queue server still

347
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:30,060
thinks there's 400 people. So it's booting people because it thinks there's supposed to be 400 in

348
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:33,659
here, but there's only 250 from the kind of extreme thing we had to do at the very beginning

349
01:11:33,659 --> 01:11:49,239
of this room. All right. Let me turn this off. How are you guys even making these jumps in the

350
01:11:49,239 --> 01:12:03,590
first place? I can't even see to make the first jump. Nobody's already doing very well. How can

351
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:24,340
you even see this first jump? Hold on. People are falling, but not dying. You can climb back up.

352
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:29,380
Okay. This guy is seriously, he's beating the whole thing. How are you this good at this?

353
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:35,539
Half of us can't even get past the first jump. Are you fucking kidding me? Did this guy beat it

354
01:12:35,539 --> 01:13:05,659
already? Wow. Look at this guy go. Did you just beat it? He's going to sit here and taunt us.

355
01:13:05,659 --> 01:13:12,970
Hold on. Let me, let me, let me, I want to get a good view of this. How do I do that? I'm actually

356
01:13:12,970 --> 01:13:29,449
really surprised that he was able to do that. He's the real king. Yeah. Well, no, I'm the real king,

357
01:13:29,449 --> 01:13:32,649
but he can be the one that's on camera because he's doing something interesting instead of just

358
01:13:32,649 --> 01:13:44,340
falling off the same first jump. You can tell where the bottleneck is because where every single

359
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:58,119
person is here. There's a major bottleneck at this jump here. It's just inside people's heads.

360
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:04,649
All right. You got to jump to get a good view. I'm afraid if I walk forward, I'm going to die.

361
01:14:05,289 --> 01:14:26,180
Okay. I'm good. He could just sit here and taunt us. What's that? What's that command to make it so

362
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:41,050
you can't see anybody but you? Oh, that didn't work. Slash hide. Oh, one word. Oh shit. This is

363
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:46,520
way easier. I can actually see what the hell I'm doing. Oh, this is awesome. This is cool.

364
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:53,579
Just cut away from me. Cut away from me. Cut away from me. Cut away from me. I don't want

365
01:14:53,579 --> 01:15:05,859
anyone to see anything that I'm doing. Fucking give me a break. I can't. How do you get that

366
01:15:05,859 --> 01:15:21,750
first one there? People are making pretty good progress though. I got it. I got it. I'm good.

367
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:35,109
Got it. Are they throwing shit at me? All right. I'm good here. There's a lava portion. How many

368
01:15:35,109 --> 01:15:51,289
people are at the lava portion? Oh, fuck. It's okay. It's all right. I'm good. No. What happened?

369
01:15:51,289 --> 01:15:58,840
He didn't make it in the water. He didn't make it. I'm trying to win. I don't even know. I can't

370
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:13,210
see what you guys are looking at. I'm going to try to jump. Am I going the... I don't know

371
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:29,560
if I'm going the right way. This looks right. Oh shit. How do I jump on this? What? Oh, he fell.

372
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:49,930
He fell at the cactus. No. Really? That's too bad. I don't understand this jump here. I kind

373
01:16:49,930 --> 01:16:53,930
of want to turn... Okay. I'm going to turn my shit back on because I can't tell what to do here.

374
01:16:53,930 --> 01:17:24,149
Hide all, right? So how do you jump around this? Oh, you have to go down. Oh shit. Okay. What? No,

375
01:17:24,149 --> 01:17:41,510
you don't? Well, you have to grab the ladder. Shit. Okay. I wasn't paying attention to that.

376
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:57,060
Oh my fucking God. Whatever. These are all the rejects down here. Oh, damn it. He didn't sprint.

377
01:17:57,060 --> 01:18:24,550
Oh, somebody said they just got banned. Well, what did you do? Is there any... He's going to

378
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:32,869
the end? Is there any way we can make the server queue system be actually 250 and not 400? Because

379
01:18:32,869 --> 01:18:37,270
what's happening is it's getting to... Someone's going to be being allowed to be let in, but it's

380
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:41,350
immediately booting them because the server thinks that there's supposed to be 400 slots.

381
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:51,960
I don't know if they can look into that somehow. Did it? You actually did it.

382
01:18:52,680 --> 01:19:07,640
Who did it? Which one? They deserve a gold helmet for that. Isn't LNV... LNV-42. Where are you?

383
01:19:09,659 --> 01:19:17,500
You... This is what you get for completing the mission. LNV-42. Yeah, are they...

384
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:29,720
TP me to LNV-42. Oh, they're right behind me. Oh, there you are. Here, take this gold helmet. You

385
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:44,340
deserve it. You get it? Nice job. Congratulations. You completed the jumping map. Somebody has two

386
01:19:44,340 --> 01:20:02,869
lives left. Well, be careful. All right, let's keep going. Let's continue. Follow me. Is this a

387
01:20:02,869 --> 01:20:08,979
maze? Wait, is this just a long... Remember, if you have lives remaining, hit slash die and you will

388
01:20:08,979 --> 01:20:13,159
start at the beginning. This is a maze again. Yeah, this is a maze. This one looks easier,

389
01:20:13,159 --> 01:20:28,760
though. Take that, though. All right. I mean, why wouldn't I? Don't open. Why not? I do hide all

390
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:44,789
again. Yeah, those of you that can... You guys listening for the server side of stuff, can

391
01:20:44,789 --> 01:20:47,829
somebody look into the whole queue thing because I think people are actually getting just booted

392
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:58,380
just by being brought in. Okay, cool. I don't want to hide all players, though, because then I can't

393
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:30,439
cheat and follow somebody. Redstone? Everybody... Why is everybody saying, holy shit? This is an

394
01:21:30,439 --> 01:21:37,640
algorithm maze? Is everybody saying this is going to take hours? No, the other one took like 10

395
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:57,909
minutes for someone to get to the end. Pressure plates, too. I don't know. What do they do?

396
01:21:57,909 --> 01:22:12,199
I see name tags. Shit, we were already here. This is wrong. I remember this is the diamond.

397
01:22:12,199 --> 01:22:34,060
That's where I got the diamond. Shit. This way? Everyone wants to get TP to the end of the parkour

398
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:43,460
course, say in chat. Well, if you want to... Wait, why can I see you? Wait, did I beat it? Oh, no.

399
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:48,470
Shit, this is the beginning of the level. This is the very beginning of the game. I went all the way

400
01:22:48,470 --> 01:23:02,869
in the back. I went all the way back. Okay, I'll get it. Here we go. If you do slash die, you will

401
01:23:02,869 --> 01:23:11,500
appear right at the beginning of the maze. This way. There's the diamond. I'm going to make some

402
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:24,760
Hansel and Gretel shit here, okay? Yes, I can. Nope, this way. This is going to last six hours.

403
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:29,000
No, it won't. I have the magic of the fucking staff. I can just break through a wall if I want.

404
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:42,340
Okay, yeah, they're working on the queue thing right now. That's what they're telling me.

405
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:52,100
Yeah, people can still come in, but there's just a problem with the actual number. It's running into

406
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:58,630
itself, essentially. They're trying to figure it out. Stop cheating. I'm just collecting samples.

407
01:23:58,630 --> 01:24:11,670
All right. How did I go the wrong way? Here, come this way. I know I just fucking cheated,

408
01:24:11,670 --> 01:24:31,000
but it's all right. Well, how did you guys do that? That's kind of unfair. That's unfair.

409
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:40,569
And I even blocked it too, so they can't go that way. I'm just checking on how people are doing,

410
01:24:40,569 --> 01:24:44,729
and I don't have to beat this. I just have to check on people. Oh, fuck, you got in. It's all

411
01:24:44,729 --> 01:25:09,539
right. All right, let me see where people are. Nice. That's a pretty cool costume, dude. All right.

412
01:25:09,539 --> 01:25:19,829
Hey, how close are we? How far away from the end are we at this stage now? We are absolutely nowhere

413
01:25:19,829 --> 01:25:34,760
near the end of this maze. Not even close. All right. Well, what if I do this? All right,

414
01:25:35,239 --> 01:25:48,329
somebody might actually beat it, he said. Wait, do people... Am I the only one that can do this?

415
01:25:48,329 --> 01:26:04,979
I got banned, and the reason listed was A. A, well, cut it out. I'm just a helper. I'm just helping.

416
01:26:04,979 --> 01:26:11,750
Somebody is apparently close to the end, or at least close enough. I kind of want to see. I want

417
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:25,859
to look over here. Can I see? I want to see where everybody is. I have no idea where the hell I'm

418
01:26:25,859 --> 01:26:35,239
supposed to be going right now. Is that a Snorlax? That's a Snorlax costume. Hey, guys, I found

419
01:26:35,239 --> 01:26:50,359
another way. That person has a Minecon cape? Yeah, this is today. Why are we doing this? It's a

420
01:26:50,359 --> 01:26:59,319
Minecraft day. Can I be TP to the maze, please? Type slash die. You will be at the very beginning.

421
01:26:59,319 --> 01:27:14,260
Hey, what about if I had to take this one? It's a Minecraft Minecon 2013 shirt. That's the rare

422
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:39,720
one. I feel like I'm making this harder. Did somebody beat it? Who beat it? Hold on. What was

423
01:27:39,720 --> 01:28:10,310
it? GM3? Oh my fucking God. There are people that are really are right at the end. You're so close.

424
01:28:10,310 --> 01:28:19,510
Oh, wow. You guys are so close. You're almost there. It's right here. Oh, you did it. Somebody

425
01:28:19,510 --> 01:28:25,340
actually did it. A lot of you did it. Holy shit. Almost all of you did it. Where was I? What the

426
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:38,729
hell was I doing? How far was I? How far away was I? I was like three quarters. This is a cool

427
01:28:38,729 --> 01:28:55,720
looking level. They're TPing to you. Oh, sit on. All right, what's in here? Oh, we got a boss battle.

428
01:28:56,359 --> 01:29:02,170
All the servers or queue servers are down. Yeah, I think that they're coming down because I think

429
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:10,170
they're trying to apply a fix to make it so people can get in. Oh, this motherfucker has a health bar.

430
01:29:10,170 --> 01:29:24,470
Get him. What's his name? The Ender Knight? If you hit slash die, you'll get teleported into this room,

431
01:29:24,470 --> 01:29:39,270
everybody. This is unfair. This dude is, he can't even move. We keep going into these people's

432
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:48,340
really cool looking houses. Oh, wait, fuck. Look at this stuff. There's like little bugs all over

433
01:29:48,340 --> 01:30:09,159
the ground. Did we just cheese him? No, he still has health. Stun lock penetration. So he's shitting

434
01:30:09,159 --> 01:30:28,550
out these little bugs. Do these bugs hurt? It's just everywhere. I can't even kill them fast enough.

435
01:30:29,189 --> 01:30:46,060
Get him. Yeah, get him. Oh, all right. Did the Ender Knight just win with a walk off grand slam

436
01:30:46,060 --> 01:31:01,100
in the world series? I don't even know where he is. Everybody's swarming this guy. I'm just

437
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:07,319
waiting for a Gatorade jump to be dumped on his head. Just kill him. Don't even let him do

438
01:31:07,319 --> 01:31:25,260
anything. Just don't even let him move. Is anybody even dead? I don't think he's hurt anybody.

439
01:31:26,470 --> 01:31:32,710
I don't think he can. I think he's been stun locked the whole time. Don't you die if an Enderman

440
01:31:32,710 --> 01:31:52,380
looks at you for like five seconds. He can't even look at anybody. He needs more ram. He's

441
01:31:52,380 --> 01:32:06,310
going to be dead air in a second. Need more wham? Wham? Oh, okay. I know what you're doing.

442
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:15,689
How did everybody get diamond armor just quickly? Is there armaments that they could get into?

443
01:32:16,810 --> 01:32:25,319
Somebody said, sorry, but I'm officially lost in the maze. Yeah, man. I feel you. I feel you, dude.

444
01:32:25,319 --> 01:32:31,239
I know. If you want to give up a life, you can do slash die and get in here. I know, man. It's

445
01:32:31,239 --> 01:32:45,020
fucking rough. Are you in the first maze? If you're in the first maze, I know, man. It's hard. It's

446
01:32:45,020 --> 01:33:03,539
really hard. We kill him. I think we killed him. Hello? Wait, what? Oh, he's dead. We got it.

447
01:33:03,539 --> 01:33:08,920
All right. Let's go. Nice. We got it. Look at this. Look at that dragon. That's a pretty sick

448
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:20,810
dragon. Wait until maze three. Well, we'll see. All right. Coming up next, we have what I think

449
01:33:21,289 --> 01:33:40,600
is it another jump map? Oh, god damn it. I fell already. All right. I actually want to do this one

450
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:55,819
right. This looks fun. This looks fun. I want to do this right. You only get 10 lives. Keep that in

451
01:33:55,819 --> 01:34:11,909
mind. Be careful. Oh shit. Are we going to get a jump maze? That'd be really funny actually.

452
01:34:11,909 --> 01:34:20,859
Anyone else getting, I'm not going to say that. This is a mine cough, mine, uh, guy, mine con

453
01:34:20,859 --> 01:34:41,050
stream. I almost said conference. Fucking god damn it. All right. Whatever. Let's go. I'm

454
01:34:41,050 --> 01:35:06,390
going to play mine con day stream. Not mine conference day. Rear ending blunder.

455
01:35:10,470 --> 01:35:30,789
What? How did you beat it already? What the fuck? Look at this guy. Oh my god. No way.

456
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:40,659
There's a couple of people that are doing really well. I, this is not a paid actor. I prompt now,

457
01:35:40,659 --> 01:35:54,100
cut to my camera. This is us normal people. Okay. Some of you are not even jumping. You're just

458
01:35:54,100 --> 01:36:16,260
walking off and dying. I just kind of like watching. This is, oh, they can't see the edge.

459
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:24,539
Yeah. I guess that's true. What the fuck is that? Wait, is that, I thought that was in the wall.

460
01:36:24,539 --> 01:36:43,239
Wait, that's not, that's a person. Paid actors. No. So many people. So people have, this is first

461
01:36:43,239 --> 01:36:47,800
jump of the stair with the ladder. People have a lot of problem with, I'd get down there to it

462
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:54,279
myself, but you know, I, you know, it's kind of fun to see what people do. You have four. Yeah.

463
01:36:54,279 --> 01:37:09,720
If you've got, try to hold on to those lives. They're precious. If I go down here, it's really

464
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:16,460
interesting to see. This group right here is really, really doing pretty well. I think they're

465
01:37:16,460 --> 01:37:21,930
working together. I think they're playing together. Oh, that guy tried to just flex so hard and he

466
01:37:21,930 --> 01:37:29,510
dropped. That was a huge flex that guy was trying to do. He was going like world one, one Mario

467
01:37:29,510 --> 01:37:39,420
strat. You just don't stop moving. Somebody's shooting an arrow at me. It's not going to work,

468
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:54,069
man. All right. I'm going to, I'm going to try. I want to try now. Do some shout casting. Okay.

469
01:37:54,069 --> 01:38:03,000
Yeah, sure. Welcome to the entrance of the dungeon here. We have quite a few players.

470
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:11,319
We've got, uh, Ko Hagen here, Ko, Ko seven, Ko Hagen here, uh, taking a look over the

471
01:38:12,199 --> 01:38:17,399
edge of the world here, like a few of his fellow players. We also have, uh, him and his team there.

472
01:38:17,399 --> 01:38:21,079
There's a, there's two, 16 teams of 25 people at the same time.

473
01:38:24,890 --> 01:38:28,890
Palm seal making a big jump board gets to there. I'm not sure what happened next. He looks like

474
01:38:28,890 --> 01:38:33,579
he's stuffed underneath all the players. Really, really bad spot to be him. And you can't see,

475
01:38:33,579 --> 01:38:40,380
hopefully he has his hide slash all, uh, activated. We've got El Qwerty, Qwerty keyboard up here. Nice

476
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:47,210
jump onto the tire. Nice jump onto the tires. Can he make it all the way up around? He can go over

477
01:38:47,210 --> 01:38:53,560
the top. Here comes one of the hardest jumps of the entire event. Can he got it? El Qwerty

478
01:38:54,979 --> 01:39:01,699
showing us how to do it. Falling down into the pool. This is the tough part and he makes it too.

479
01:39:01,699 --> 01:39:09,189
We're following Qwerty here, folks doing an excellent job. Now he's got this. He gots the

480
01:39:09,189 --> 01:39:13,430
double ladder jump to make now crouching. Make sure to fall off by the, if you don't play Minecraft,

481
01:39:13,430 --> 01:39:20,069
if you crouch, you don't fall off. He's using that to his advantage. Oh, Qwerty pretty gone.

482
01:39:20,710 --> 01:39:34,949
Oh, we have the court jester. That guy is naked. Oh, he's naked. There are people that aren't even

483
01:39:34,949 --> 01:39:46,710
trying. They're shooting with arrows. Come on. Come on. Super Daza. Super Daza. That was a couple

484
01:39:46,710 --> 01:39:58,779
of really good jumps in a row. Let's see it. Line it up. Oh, he got it. Got it. Dude, no.

485
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:13,350
Hey, come on. Quit hogging the little steak here, man. Is this person just naked? No. This looks

486
01:40:13,350 --> 01:40:20,760
like the hard one because you have to balance on this and then jump to here. That person has a plus

487
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:38,170
two germacraft joke. I'm going for it. I want to be one of the people here. This is what it's like.

488
01:40:38,170 --> 01:41:04,140
How do you grab a ladder? This whole W, right? A. Oh, I just showed you I was cheating. What is A?

489
01:41:04,140 --> 01:41:13,699
Why are people being banned for A? I don't know. I have no idea. What does A mean? What a jump that

490
01:41:13,699 --> 01:41:21,140
was. Oh, I had some lag there. Having a little bit of lag. I'm okay. Game's kind of laggy. It's

491
01:41:21,140 --> 01:41:27,699
probably the server issues. There's a server problem sometimes. All right, I'm on. Yeah, I think

492
01:41:28,260 --> 01:41:34,970
don't know what A means. Because we had to quickly just turn off the server and make it 250 instead

493
01:41:34,970 --> 01:41:41,189
of 400, something got messed up and they're trying to figure it out. I will tell you this.

494
01:41:41,189 --> 01:41:46,899
This server is just going to be on after this is over. This stream essentially is a gigantic

495
01:41:46,899 --> 01:41:51,380
advertisement for the fact that this is going to stay turned on for 24-7 and it's going to just

496
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:55,779
kind of turn into like a Minecraft server. There's a giant advertisement for it. You're going to be

497
01:41:55,779 --> 01:42:05,300
able to play through this whenever you want. Sellout. It's not a sellout. It's the server

498
01:42:05,300 --> 01:42:21,670
that's my name. Are we going to do a fire festival stream? I don't want to play your damn maze.

499
01:42:22,630 --> 01:42:40,229
Stay. I can do the maze. Ego maniac sellout. That's so funny. All right, this is a hard one.

500
01:42:40,789 --> 01:42:52,520
Let's fucking watch out for the wind. There's Mario wind. If you fall off the edge, watch out

501
01:42:52,520 --> 01:43:12,619
for the wind. See? What a recovery. I want to try this jump here with nobody here. Let me turn it

502
01:43:12,619 --> 01:43:22,180
off. That doesn't work. Yeah. Remember if you're stuck somewhere, if you're in an old game,

503
01:43:22,819 --> 01:43:40,699
I slash die. Fuck, I actually made it. This is a fire festival stream. Yeah, that's all right.

504
01:43:42,220 --> 01:43:51,289
At least it works. An hour ago, I didn't think it was even going to work. It's actually kind of cool.

505
01:43:51,289 --> 01:44:02,819
It's actually fun. Can you pause the stream? Can you pause the stream? I need to eat my

506
01:44:02,819 --> 01:44:19,699
pasta. Just go. It's all right. You're not going to miss much. I'm still going to be falling on

507
01:44:19,699 --> 01:44:39,140
the same jump every time. He hates his viewers. What? No, I can't. These people that have beat it.

508
01:44:39,859 --> 01:44:51,609
That's over 50%. I think we can go to the next arena. Yeah, that's a lot of people. That's enough

509
01:44:51,609 --> 01:45:10,229
to keep going. Pause it. Pause it. I've actually seen shit. Final Fantasy 6? 8? How do we keep

510
01:45:10,229 --> 01:45:32,970
going? 7. Right, right, right. How come I can't see anything? I said the one's in between. Yeah,

511
01:45:32,970 --> 01:45:47,670
yeah. How come I can't hide at all? All right, what is this one? King's Armory is this way.

512
01:45:48,630 --> 01:46:03,989
Oh, this is where we've got the diamond shit. Nice. I got to put this all on. What am I stuck

513
01:46:03,989 --> 01:46:35,100
in? Cement? What's this one? It's a big springboard. This barrow all over the ground.

514
01:46:35,180 --> 01:47:02,619
Do you have a health bar too? Mr. Slime Boss. What about the raid loot? Is there any raid loot?

515
01:47:02,619 --> 01:47:16,489
I think there might be something falling out of them. This is some good book reading music.

516
01:47:28,069 --> 01:47:45,930
He just destroyed that guy. That guy was nothing. This area is really cool looking.

517
01:47:52,729 --> 01:48:01,579
That looks awesome. All right, on to the next one. Let's go. Where's the next room? Down here.

518
01:48:11,060 --> 01:48:21,880
Here we go. Boys and girls, it looks like it's going to be time for a maze. Oh, no, no, no,

519
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:34,779
no. Never mind. Oh, this room is actually really, really cool. How are you all the way up there

520
01:48:34,779 --> 01:49:01,539
already? I don't understand. From the OST back up? Not too loud though. Man of three voices,

521
01:49:01,539 --> 01:49:17,079
man of three mini games. Get out of here. That was pretty good. That was pretty good. That was

522
01:49:17,079 --> 01:49:34,890
really funny. But ban that person for an hour. I just got in my ear with it working on this stuff

523
01:49:34,890 --> 01:49:38,010
on the other side and just said, are you just shooting into the crowd? And I didn't realize

524
01:49:38,010 --> 01:49:57,189
that. Yeah, I'm just shooting into the fucking crowd. So who this is, it's ice blocks. Oh,

525
01:49:57,189 --> 01:50:15,510
fuck that. I ain't going to be able to do that one. Oh, nice try. Yeah. You can barely even see the

526
01:50:15,510 --> 01:50:30,579
blocks. Someone will get it. The cycle of life. Man of three voices, man of three mini games.

527
01:50:31,779 --> 01:50:44,739
I nominate that for a moment. Melon Boy. Oh, wait, no, that was what you're supposed to do.

528
01:50:45,300 --> 01:51:05,750
Was it? Some of the guys that were part corn really well. This looks tricky for them. And

529
01:51:05,750 --> 01:51:10,779
green tea sips. He's killing people. Oh, well, at some point somebody got my lightning stick

530
01:51:10,779 --> 01:51:20,699
and just started casting it at random people. I don't even know where that is now. I have no

531
01:51:20,699 --> 01:51:44,220
idea where it is. All right. Four or five people have made it here. Here are the saviors of this

532
01:51:44,220 --> 01:52:12,359
level. Green tea sips has committed a get rid of them. What does any of this have to do with the

533
01:52:12,359 --> 01:52:19,260
king? Well, it had something to do with it, but everything kind of broke multiple times. So we

534
01:52:19,260 --> 01:52:27,779
just skipped all the we skipped all the lore just to get into the video game. It was significant

535
01:52:27,779 --> 01:52:38,149
lore here. Oh, shit. They're almost here. Once you go all the way around, then you just go.

536
01:52:39,430 --> 01:52:52,500
Here you go. That sucks. Wow. That sucks. Yeah, that's so funny. Look at how many people are

537
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:57,140
just waiting at the bottom waiting for someone to beat it. These guys are just hanging out.

538
01:52:57,140 --> 01:53:04,520
This might as well just be mine con. Everybody's in diamond armor has diamond swords just walking

539
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:17,020
around. There are people that are really trying to there's a significant amount of people that

540
01:53:17,020 --> 01:53:22,460
are attempting the first part and some of them are just kind of like walking into each other

541
01:53:22,460 --> 01:53:36,789
and walking around. This person trying to fuck it up for everybody else. Are you the guy that's

542
01:53:36,789 --> 01:53:51,460
from Boston that beat Dark Souls three on stream? I hope not. I am sorry to say mental anguish from

543
01:53:51,460 --> 01:53:57,939
the queue. I wish there was something I could do about it, but I cannot do anything about it.

544
01:53:57,939 --> 01:54:05,670
All I can hope is that maybe they can figure out what's the problem is. I am just I am just

545
01:54:05,670 --> 01:54:17,939
participating. I am just participating with you all. Apparently there are thousands and

546
01:54:17,939 --> 01:54:22,939
thousands of people that are like trying to do it and that's that's fine that that should work.

547
01:54:23,500 --> 01:54:28,359
But the problem is is when we changed it from 400 to 250 it fucked up all the stuff in the

548
01:54:28,359 --> 01:54:34,789
server. So they're trying to figure it out. A true king would have freed us by now. I can't.

549
01:54:35,899 --> 01:54:44,359
I'm king in name only. Understand? What's what's that movie? Isn't there like what's the

550
01:54:44,680 --> 01:54:50,600
movie about a guy that's not like this? That's not a real guy. He's like he's not the real

551
01:54:50,600 --> 01:55:12,760
fuck the king. He's the useless king. Worst king puppet king. This is why you should do practice

552
01:55:12,760 --> 01:55:28,739
streams. We did many of them just don't know Shrek 40 incoming. The discord is absolutely

553
01:55:28,739 --> 01:55:37,130
mauled right now. I don't even want to go over there. It's like going home with a bad report

554
01:55:37,130 --> 01:55:49,130
card. I don't want to go in there. I'm going to go to my friend Dave's house for like an hour.

555
01:55:49,130 --> 01:55:54,970
Hey son are you coming home to show your report card? Yeah yeah um yeah I will.

556
01:55:56,550 --> 01:56:01,029
Dave do you have this exact black ink that matches the report card so I can change

557
01:56:01,909 --> 01:56:09,779
this uh this this to a B? I I was gonna put a line through the D. We need to make it a perfect B.

558
01:56:16,819 --> 01:56:37,000
Somebody making progress. Did he do it? He did it! New king. No he gets an item. He gets the golden

559
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:55,619
boots of the golden boots of Ratatouille stream incoming. Keep those on. No nice work. Let's go!

560
01:56:55,619 --> 01:57:08,979
I actually know what one of the mazes is and if everyone's gonna fucking flip out I everyone's

561
01:57:08,979 --> 01:57:13,899
gonna lose their minds. In fact if we should probably just skip it because people are gonna

562
01:57:13,899 --> 01:57:18,300
get very very mad at me for having it. They're gonna be very upset with me. I'm gonna get screamed

563
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:31,960
at. Shoot into the peasants. How am I listening to you? So many arrows here. All right are we

564
01:57:31,960 --> 01:57:43,529
moving on to the next one? Flab with a guy that makes poops go. Let's go. I do that. That's me.

565
01:57:44,090 --> 01:58:05,029
Is this the entrance? Can we knock it through this? Oh there we go. Oh yeah. Dude mace free Pog. Mace

566
01:58:05,029 --> 01:58:30,789
free Pog. Pog mace. Pog mace found it. This is so fake. I'm gonna just find the entrance. I'm gonna

567
01:58:30,789 --> 01:58:40,359
find the exit real quick. How many more rooms are there? I think there's only like like what five

568
01:58:40,359 --> 01:59:07,720
more rooms or something. You're my I am sad. Okay let's go. Get in here. By the way this is a three

569
01:59:07,720 --> 01:59:14,520
level maze. There's staircases between each maze. This is three tier. This is a three tiered cake

570
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:20,970
maze. This is the hard one and don't worry if nobody figures it out in the next 30 to 60 seconds

571
01:59:20,970 --> 01:59:24,970
I'm cutting through the bottom of the cake and I'm gonna pop out like a fucking birthday party.

572
01:59:25,689 --> 01:59:38,090
You're just torturing his fans. I keep like laughing too much today. I'm gonna be in pain.

573
01:59:42,149 --> 01:59:56,140
Just like torture people. It's so funny. It's just you guys have just roasted me right now and it's

574
01:59:56,140 --> 02:00:09,500
fucking hilarious dude. This is considered cruel and unusual punishment. Wait how people are actually

575
02:00:09,500 --> 02:00:27,060
getting up top? They shouldn't be able to do that right? You can get up. This is a great view though.

576
02:00:27,060 --> 02:00:30,819
This is what a scientist feels like when he looks down. When he's like the mouse and the cheese and

577
02:00:30,819 --> 02:00:43,100
shit. Outplayed. Where's the staircase? Would you ever make a goo to cheese review? Yeah I'll do it

578
02:00:43,100 --> 02:00:59,510
right now. That's all right. We are about rats in a maze. Actually did this yeah being just an

579
02:00:59,510 --> 02:01:08,649
observer is much better. I can just see people progress. Maze experiment. This is a Stanford

580
02:01:09,529 --> 02:01:16,760
I just puked. Stanford maze experiment. Somebody already got to it. Somebody made it up to the

581
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:28,229
next tier already. This one even that this one's not that bad. Oh he's trying to see where the

582
02:01:28,229 --> 02:01:45,930
staircase is. I have like god mode. I can't even see where it is. Ah okay I gotta settle down.

583
02:01:46,869 --> 02:01:53,960
The like cruel torture of your viewers. Like forcing you to do a bunch of gigantic mazes and

584
02:01:53,960 --> 02:02:07,539
shit like that. It's just torturing everybody. When do you release the creepers? Yeah I feel

585
02:02:07,539 --> 02:02:15,340
like I should be the AI director. Why are there holes in the ground? Oh my god that's evil.

586
02:02:17,109 --> 02:02:20,630
Shit that's fucking evil because then you have to do the whole thing in the bottom again.

587
02:02:20,630 --> 02:02:34,090
Oh my goodness that's evil. Is this Star Wars music? I don't think so. I think it's copyright

588
02:02:34,090 --> 02:02:49,300
free. Oh there it is over here. So there's one there's another layer up top. So somebody

589
02:02:49,859 --> 02:02:55,670
got somebody's already at the top. This did not take as long as it. Why is this one taking so

590
02:02:55,670 --> 02:03:03,000
few amount of time? But the other ones were so much harder. Oh right because you could peek.

591
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:09,319
Oh right right right right right. Guys I promise you there's only one more maze and it's the worst

592
02:03:09,319 --> 02:03:16,149
one. And this it is going to be it's going to be horrendous. I've seen it already. There's only one

593
02:03:16,149 --> 02:03:31,420
more maze. So it's um it's absurd. You guys are going to lose your mind. It gets it's going to be

594
02:03:31,420 --> 02:03:51,750
worse. Yes way worse. You don't even know. Way worse. Way more difficult. Oh there's no cheating

595
02:03:51,750 --> 02:04:10,920
on level three. We're losing consciousness. So realm of the mad king. Yeah oh shit I have my

This shit's impossible. Good luck. Let the torture commence. Ow. He rips off the prize winner. No I'm

657
02:18:56,629 --> 02:19:08,069
I'll give him. Oh don't worry. I didn't know. I tried to give it to him. I think this is the end.

658
02:19:08,069 --> 02:19:34,549
I think there's one more room after this. I've had a nightmare like this. Yeah I have too. End of

659
02:19:34,549 --> 02:19:53,979
career voice. No my career is just fine. I think it has killed somebody accidentally. This sick

660
02:19:53,979 --> 02:20:08,680
fuck is making his viewers relive his nightmares. All I've been doing is like laughing this whole

661
02:20:08,680 --> 02:20:15,540
stream. I've been laughing at like just the roast job. Every time I look over a chat there's like a

662
02:20:15,540 --> 02:20:37,500
new like top of our roast me comment. He's a redditor. Yeah you all you all redditors too.

663
02:20:37,500 --> 02:20:50,090
Everybody here's a redditor. So I'm just gonna I'm gonna take a look. See where everybody is.

664
02:20:54,229 --> 02:20:58,139
Not bad. All right. All right. For all the things that we're talking about some of you guys are

665
02:20:58,139 --> 02:21:09,319
really good at this shit. Some of you guys actually are very good at doing this. Like look the people

666
02:21:09,319 --> 02:21:24,469
over here. These guys are just on a mission. Redditing. You're ruining the immersion. Well I

667
02:21:24,469 --> 02:21:43,500
want you I'm having you see that image is just. Can you pull that image up on stream?

668
02:21:43,500 --> 02:21:48,950
That's funny to me. The image that they're spamming in the chat. Is it possible to get that shown on

669
02:21:48,950 --> 02:22:15,049
the stream? He knows what it is. Would you be upset if a cow fell through your ceiling?

670
02:22:15,049 --> 02:22:18,409
Yeah that would be horrible. That would be a terrible thing to have happen. What are you

671
02:22:18,409 --> 02:22:38,840
talking about? If a cow fell through the ceiling right now that would be a disaster.

672
02:22:38,840 --> 02:23:07,770
All right we got somebody's close. Don't look up. Where's the closest person? I think I would die.

673
02:23:07,770 --> 02:23:13,739
Yeah you mean you would. If a cow landed through the ceiling on top of you. You're sitting at your

674
02:23:13,739 --> 02:23:17,260
chair. You're dead. You're going to instantly die. It's gonna break every bone in your body.

675
02:23:17,260 --> 02:23:28,819
Aren't cows like 700 pounds? A cow is like a thousand pounds. That's like half a car dropping

676
02:23:28,819 --> 02:23:45,450
on your head. They did it. See you guys are actually good at this. Some of you guys can

677
02:23:45,450 --> 02:23:55,610
actually do this shit really really well. 1400 pounds. That's a car man. That's a small car.

678
02:23:55,610 --> 02:24:04,899
That's one of those gerbil cars. Is it called the key of gerbil? What's the song name? I actually

679
02:24:04,899 --> 02:24:14,229
don't know. Congratulations to those of you that went through. Clueless sniper. Nice job.

680
02:24:23,500 --> 02:24:34,459
All right let's move on to the next encounter. We're about to enter the one of the final rooms.

681
02:24:40,659 --> 02:24:50,020
Serious Sam. Fuck I want to play Serious Sam too. Yeah we can go. Where is the actual end?

682
02:24:50,819 --> 02:25:00,149
Okay I still can't. I'm flying around. I can't find the end. I have no idea where the end is

683
02:25:00,149 --> 02:25:11,590
and I can fly through a building. Oh there we go. All right here's here we go. Time for

684
02:25:11,590 --> 02:25:19,670
this is the final boss. The two yetis. Oh fuck these guys actually look like they're attacking.

685
02:25:20,950 --> 02:25:25,030
Yeah this is actually dangerous I think. I think people are going to die here.

686
02:25:25,030 --> 02:25:41,350
What the fuck was that? All right I'm turning off my god mode. I want to get in. I thought that was

687
02:25:41,350 --> 02:26:02,260
in the game and I just freaked out. Another raid boss. This is the last raid boss. Did this share

688
02:26:02,260 --> 02:26:20,389
health? Cod zombies. Why is somebody just jumping in my camera? Get out of here.

689
02:26:24,500 --> 02:26:40,899
I have a diamond sword don't I? Somewhere. Where the hell is it? Focus one at a time.

690
02:26:44,219 --> 02:27:09,590
We're splitting our damage up. Kill one at a time. I need a weapon. Where the fuck is the

691
02:27:09,590 --> 02:27:26,069
healer? Let's see if I have any. Yeah we go. Oh shit. Wait what happened? I just had it.

692
02:27:26,069 --> 02:27:37,860
It turned into a bow. Oh there we go. All right I got my I got my I got my weapon back.

693
02:27:45,110 --> 02:27:49,670
This really is just recess. This is what I would feel like. This is what recess is like.

694
02:27:50,389 --> 02:27:56,180
I get it now. I know what it's like to be a teacher. This is just outdoor recess.

695
02:28:00,950 --> 02:28:16,219
Just replace the bows with little balls or nerf balls. No tanks all dps. I can't even hurt this

696
02:28:16,219 --> 02:28:36,870
guy like this. One chat walking around beating everybody up. Where is the bad guy? All dps.

697
02:28:37,510 --> 02:28:51,059
One of them has two hearts down. What the hell kind of school did Jeremy go to? No I'm not I'm

698
02:28:51,059 --> 02:29:01,180
just I'm not saying it's like an all-out brawl outside. Kids like throwing rocks at each other

699
02:29:01,180 --> 02:29:07,530
and biting each other and punch all of them while punching each other. Yeah that would be really

700
02:29:07,530 --> 02:29:17,750
kind of a fucked up place to be. You're right. The amount of people just looking and waiting and

701
02:29:17,750 --> 02:29:35,219
watching is so funny. Bones? Brawl? All right how much health does he have left? He's not even

702
02:29:35,219 --> 02:29:48,520
rendering on my screen. Anybody else feel like that some of these clips can be taken to make it

703
02:29:48,520 --> 02:29:59,780
seem like your Minecraft clan is really fucking cool? You'll take some of these with the music

704
02:29:59,780 --> 02:30:13,530
in the background and look at this. This is like clan chaos. Don't fuck with us. We're clan carnage.

705
02:30:13,530 --> 02:30:30,090
We don't fuck around at all. We're just really really really just not intimidating at all.

706
02:30:34,489 --> 02:30:42,620
Clan cringe? Okay I'm gonna start lightning this fucking guy. I'm gonna I'm taking 10 health bars

707
02:30:42,620 --> 02:31:01,350
down right now. Where is he? This dude only has two hearts and they would be really close to the

708
02:31:01,350 --> 02:31:26,040
microphone. Sign up on our website clancarnage.com if you think you have what it takes. Wait I can type

709
02:31:26,040 --> 02:31:32,979
what? This is not gonna kill. If I type slash does that kill everybody if I do slash kill?

710
02:31:33,860 --> 02:31:40,579
Can I get confirmed what that does? What happens if I do slash kill?

711
02:31:42,790 --> 02:31:57,829
Yeah yeah it would be a wordpress or vlog spot. That's true. Clan carnage accepting applications

712
02:31:57,829 --> 02:32:11,770
now. Only kill mobs? All right can I can I can I can I get a manual kill on this guy?

713
02:32:11,770 --> 02:32:25,079
How come I can't even see him? Why am I still in my own game? I feel like I'm not even here.

714
02:32:25,879 --> 02:32:39,510
Yeah why is my lightning stick not killing anything? He's gone invisible. Oh it works on

715
02:32:39,510 --> 02:32:55,190
players only okay. Remember you never existed. Oh did I get him? Did I actually hit him with

716
02:32:55,190 --> 02:33:39,989
something? Clan carnage. Oh shit what did we kill it? Did we win? Fist of the sword. Whoa!

717
02:33:45,899 --> 02:33:51,340
Oh my god people are dying. People are dying! What do we do? What do we do? What's going on?

718
02:33:51,340 --> 02:34:13,770
Did somebody put like a kill block here? How do I move them? Is he dead? Oh they're being

719
02:34:13,770 --> 02:34:23,590
tele-frag. 500 people on one block is gonna tele-frag if it happens. Dude I can't even see.

720
02:34:23,590 --> 02:34:26,629
I'm just getting colors. It looks like the beginning of the stream. It looks like the

721
02:34:26,629 --> 02:34:45,579
structure that they made. That work? Stuck on a block with somebody. Yeah one of these blocks

722
02:34:45,579 --> 02:34:54,540
dumb. I'm at times 10 speed right now. All right I have this dragon sword. Am I gonna go kill this

723
02:34:54,540 --> 02:35:08,709
dragon? All right guys it's time for the end. It's time for the end of recess. Hopefully the

724
02:35:08,709 --> 02:35:17,399
bell doesn't ring before we go pretend to kill the dragon. All of a sudden it's gonna be like

725
02:35:19,770 --> 02:35:33,559
about to kill the dragon. Come on in you little bastards. No we're not done with the dragon.

726
02:35:34,379 --> 02:35:50,120
You had the fucking dragon. Yeah oh I died. Now get the fucking class. Uh okay. Dragon coming?

727
02:35:54,139 --> 02:36:01,530
The dragon. Oh whoa oh boy we got extra time at recess. The principal came out. Hey kids

728
02:36:03,100 --> 02:36:09,020
it's me the principal. I know that you guys wanted to play some more outside and frankly

729
02:36:09,020 --> 02:36:19,899
I need another 20 minutes in my office. Recess has been extended by 10 minutes. Go have fun with

730
02:36:19,899 --> 02:36:27,270
you and slay whatever dragon you want. That's right remember me and tell your parents to vote

731
02:36:27,270 --> 02:36:34,790

732
02:36:34,790 --> 02:36:42,040
only even have an extra 15 minutes at recess. Yeah by the way I'm getting rid of taxes in this

734
02:37:08,950 --> 02:37:18,120

735
02:37:19,159 --> 02:37:23,540
They're killing each other. Where did this one come from?

736
02:37:27,690 --> 02:37:34,250
Now get off me. One of the cafeteria ladies jumped on me. You can't give them extra time outside.

737
02:37:34,250 --> 02:37:42,760
They need to learn. Get off. Now kids don't worry I'll take care of this. Oh shit he's throwing

trees at me. You idiot. Get back in class and remember it's mystery meat today.

Get her. No get away from me. You little shit kid. Have some more sloppy jokes.

740
02:38:28,549 --> 02:38:30,950
I made an extra sloppy for you.

741
02:38:33,670 --> 02:38:37,590
Oh I know how you kids like a sloppy.

742
02:38:39,989 --> 02:38:59,700
We got her. We got him. We did it. We killed the dragon. Hey and let me get off here and say

743
02:38:59,700 --> 02:39:15,819
let it be known that kids now rule the school. No more nap times. No more math homework.

744
02:39:17,659 --> 02:39:26,260
We run the school. Recess all day and french fries only for lunch.

745
02:39:35,959 --> 02:39:40,360
Kids come on in. It's time for recess to be over. It's me principal Davidson.

746
02:39:40,360 --> 02:39:47,020
Just a regular person. Not anything weird going on. I'm just normal. Oh what the heck.

747
02:39:47,659 --> 02:39:51,319
Okay yeah it's gone. I've got to go. I've got to go into school now.

748
02:39:59,270 --> 02:40:06,860
For the kindergarten. This structure is perfect for the kindergarten by the way.

749
02:40:06,860 --> 02:40:14,180
This is just kindergarten scream. This was just this was keep. Oh we went to we went

750
02:40:14,180 --> 02:40:21,659
to kindergarten school. This was just the plot of Billy Madison. Here go build something with

751
02:40:21,659 --> 02:40:25,340
these blocks like a bunch of you. Just I'm not going to fucking pay attention. Just go do it.

752
02:40:25,340 --> 02:40:30,579
Hey look I made a really really hard maze that none of you kids are going to be able to do.

753
02:40:31,030 --> 02:40:37,690
Gonna buy me like an hour. Walk around for a little bit. Here here's some like foam swords.

754
02:40:37,690 --> 02:40:43,940
Pretend somebody's a skeleton king. This is what you this is what you built. This is this is what

755
02:40:43,940 --> 02:40:57,459
would be built in a kindergarten class. How is that the plot for Billy Madison? It isn't. I don't

756
02:40:57,459 --> 02:41:07,399
know. It's close. Kindergarten stream. This is so. How long did I think this was ever gonna work?

757
02:41:07,399 --> 02:41:23,319
Like honest to god. Turn pvp on by the way and give me that skyrim music. The stream was just

758
02:41:23,319 --> 02:41:37,020
a daycare. Recess versus reality. Should it that should be the title of this of this stream.

759
02:41:37,020 --> 02:42:10,309
Recess versus reality. We got pvp on. Change title. I missed my son's birth list. Hey Nintendo

760
02:42:10,309 --> 02:42:19,299
Wii music you know what that means. That means wait for the 2.4 gigahertz connection which is

761
02:42:19,299 --> 02:42:28,059
like actually ends up being on the Wii like like 400k down. Download and update for your system or

762
02:42:28,059 --> 02:42:35,899
to download a game that you know is like 40 megabytes and it's taking like 45 minutes and

763
02:42:35,899 --> 02:42:43,190
then they decide you get Mario starts to walk by and hit coins with his head and when he gets

764
02:42:43,190 --> 02:42:49,559
to the second box with the coins in it that means you're at 50 percent downloaded and then when you

765
02:42:49,559 --> 02:42:55,879
get to about 75 percent downloaded he spams the last coin box until you turn the fucking volume

766
02:42:55,879 --> 02:43:08,010
down on your tv. Can't just have a bar there that says 10 20 30 percent. I'm acting like this is

767
02:43:08,010 --> 02:43:42,139
happening now. That's not currently happening right now. Pvp on. That guy's gone. Wait is he?

768
02:43:42,139 --> 02:43:54,329
Murderer? Murderer? What the fuck? What? You ever visit your kingdom? Yeah you know what let's take

This guy person has a fort up here. Oh no what I just did okay what I just did is the equivalent

771
02:44:16,100 --> 02:44:21,860

772
02:44:21,860 --> 02:44:24,819

773
02:44:24,819 --> 02:44:30,260
dragon and they're using sticks and pretending they're wands. See in those kids heads they have

774
02:44:30,260 --> 02:44:35,719
their own headcanon how those wands work. If I walk out here with a wand in my hand as like
