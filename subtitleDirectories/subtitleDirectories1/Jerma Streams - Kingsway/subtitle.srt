1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:09,240
Hello, how's everybody doing? Hope you're having a good day. I'm having a pretty good day.

2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:21,079
I'm a little sloppy right now. That's because I just got out of an MRI and those are always fun.

3
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:27,160
And this time I had to get contrast. They put an IV in and they pump you full of

4
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:32,039
fucking squid ink. Whatever the hell it is. And then you, uh, they get a good image.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,259
So I'm a little sloppy right now. That's why we're late. That's why we went head to stream today.

6
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:43,979
Yesterday, uh, anything before actually, uh, Otto had a surgical procedure done to

7
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,979
all over the place. And then I got a lot of stuff going on the next few days too.

8
00:00:51,259 --> 00:01:00,380
Uh, a lot of things going on. I'm glad I did that 13 hour Lord of the Rings fuckface stream

9
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:09,370
because yeah, that, that, that was like three streams. Thankfully, because then that the next

10
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:13,450
few days, obviously I wasn't around and then juggling streams the rest of this week.

11
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:23,609
Is Otto okay? Otto was fine completely, but he had to have surgery and then I had to have an MRI.

12
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,590
And then there's all kinds of IRL stuff that I don't, I'm not really going to talk about

13
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,420
because they don't need to be talked about. So yeah, we're going to just chill out today.

14
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,420
I wasn't sure if I was going to, here comes the hype train.

15
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:55,510
Oh my God, colonoscopy too. I probably sound fucked up a little bit because

16
00:01:57,019 --> 00:02:01,099
stuff just messes with me. Well, I like mom. My mouth tastes weird.

17
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:11,900
I like fingers were like cold. I have an MRI fear. If you didn't know while the hype train continues

18
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:18,340
to throw hundreds and hundreds of dollars at this stream. Every time I go to an MRI machine,

19
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,620
I always think I've had three MRIs think of my whole life. And when I go do them,

20
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,460
I always have this weird panic where I go, Oh, wait, hold on a second. What did, but

21
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:32,020
there could be metal in me. They might be metal inside my body. I don't know.

22
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:38,150
Then you think of every single time I've ever had, boy, what about metal like in your eye?

23
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:44,150
I've ever had metal shavings in my eye. Have I ever been, have I ever been a welder? I don't know.

24
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:49,340
No, I don't think so. What about my teeth? Do my teeth have any metal in them? If I ever had a,

25
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:56,659
my teeth gonna rip out because I've had a filling. And then when you're in the machine that like,

26
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,419
you can feel your hair is kind of standing up. And I'm like, is this teeth?

27
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:12,389
Is this when the teeth come out? Cause I can feel it. The magnets just running around you. It's a,

28
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:21,780
it's a shitty experience. But yeah, I have this weird irrational fear that wait, hold on,

29
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,580
check my pockets again. Do I have, what about the rings where the loops, you know, you know,

30
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:32,659
your pants, the thing you tie your pants with, not a belt. If you have jogging pants on that

31
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:39,259
little belt pant loop thing, there's a little metal ring. No, no, not a belt. The thing,

32
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:45,189
when you wear jogging pants, drawstring, there it is. No, not a belt. Yeah. Drawstring. I know this

33
00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:52,460
word. It at on where the drawstrings connect to go through the pants to actually go around your body.

34
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:57,020
It's like a little metal ring here. And it's like, am I going to get sucked up to the top of the

35
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:04,949
machine like a cartoon? And then obviously the answer is no. We're already on level four,

36
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:14,229
the hype train too, which is fucking ridiculous. Now, obviously I don't know these things. I don't,

37
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:20,819
I don't think these things are actually going to happen, but they're, the teeth thing does

38
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:30,100
freak me out a little. Are we just doing a relaxing screen? Yes, we are. We're just going to hang out.

39
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,620
We're going to chill. We're going to play this game. Sorry if my voice sounds a little strange.

40
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:41,449
Um, it's a little raspy. I don't know why. I think it's just kind of, my body might be a little

41
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:50,490
stressed. I don't know. But thank you everybody for the third hype train in a row. Third time.

42
00:04:51,129 --> 00:05:03,459
You guys are fucking ridiculous. Please don't, please don't die. I don't plan on it. I don't

43
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:08,230
have a plan. I don't think that's going to happen. I don't plan on that, but I don't know. I could,

44
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,939
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what he plans on it. What are you doing? Don't say that.

45
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:20,379
Hype train complete. We just completed the hype train. Thanks a lot guys. Hype train.

46
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:30,009
Level four. The game we're going to play is Kingsway. It's a medieval OS. And yes,

47
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:34,870
you heard that right. It's got, somebody said it's like hypnospace outlaw, but it's an RPG.

48
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:39,860
So we're going to be something we can just relax with and play. And then tomorrow,

49
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:47,779
tomorrow is going to be an early, early stream. We're going to do an EU stream tomorrow and it's

50
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:56,009
probably going to be rhythm heaven somewhere around 11 to 12 Pacific. AM is tomorrow's stream.

51
00:05:56,569 --> 00:06:01,610
I was thinking about doing rhythm heaven tonight, but I just, I'm not, I can't,

52
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:06,790
I can't, I got like this thing wrapped around my arm because of the IV and like, I'm just,

53
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:11,750
I feel like kind of shitty. So I'd rather not wave my arms around and have sing songs and shit,

54
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:16,310
but we'll do that tomorrow. That sounds like a plan tomorrow. EU stream tomorrow.

55
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:30,899
But without further ado, as hype train continues to leave the station, let's get over here. He's

56
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:38,310
feeling a little shitty. I mean a little, a little, just like tired and I don't know, annoyed. You

57
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,910
know what I'm talking about? Anytime you go to the doctor is the day that you're going to be annoyed.

58
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:47,189
It doesn't matter. You can feel fantastic before going in. You're just going to be annoyed

59
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:57,180
afterwards. And here we go. So again, this is a operating system, a medieval operating system.

60
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:08,040
Did I dip on Joel twice? And Joel hasn't said anything to me as me. Me and Joel don't talk

61
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:14,870
unless like a stream is currently on. That's like kind of how it works. The last like three weeks,

62
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:19,910
like if one of our streams is turned on, then like, oh, then, okay. Hey Joel, hey,

63
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:27,610
oh, day German. What's up, man? The, our last conversation on discord was like,

64
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:36,860
let's see. Yeah. Last Sunday. Yo man, you still, you want to take a day off. I heard you stream

65
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:48,300
for like 12 hours. See, he's looking out for me. He's looking out for me. Actually. Hey,

66
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,699
the only time that me and Joel talk is when the streams live. So I'm going to say, I'm going to,

67
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:58,870
let's reply. Let's ready. How about this one? Hey dude. And then in brackets, yo, streams on. So

68
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,860
like, don't, like, don't, what do you mean? It's like he's going to say something. Hey,

69
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:14,120
hey, dude, the mother streams on streams on. Don't say your credit card number out loud.

70
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:26,860
All right. I'm going to say, Hey dude, um, I'm around for this weekend. EU. If you could believe

71
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:37,129
it. And I'm going to write that EU. If you could believe it, what say you on a return to keep

72
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:49,190
talking. Why am I saying it like this? All right. I sent it message sent. Let's see if we'll get

73
00:08:49,190 --> 00:09:01,960
back for an email later. My dearest Joel, I must ask you. Okay. New adventure of the slight member.

74
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:07,940
This is an operating system. Let's go to make sure everything's correct. No, no, no setting.

75
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,470
Do I want to curse a trail? Every time I ever had this on the old windows, it, I just,

76
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,950
it was like a drug simulation. I just feel like I, I feel like this is not, I've done it like this.

77
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:26,120
I'm on drugs. I don't like that. You would have, I'm on drugs or my computer sucks.

78
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:36,179
All right. This is, I'm on drugs or integrated graphics card. I don't, all of these are bad.

79
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:44,860
We're going with this. Don't, I'm not doing the drugs. No. What about background?

80
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:55,980
Did you do it? Level five hype train has been completed. How many hundreds of subs and

81
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,419
hundreds of thousands of hundreds of thousands of dollars have come in?

82
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:10,200
There it is. Hype train success hog jam. Thanks a lot guys. You guys never cease to fucking amaze

83
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,639
me with how much money you pour into the stream on a daily basis. Even when the channel is not live,

84
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:25,159
a hundred subs and 5,700 bits in just the last 10 minutes. You guys are fucking insane.

85
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:32,120
Should I do pink? No, I don't like that. No, I don't like that. No, actually pink is okay.

86
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:46,820
Did you do windows 3.1? Purple, purple, purple, purple, purple. No, I don't like that either.

87
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:55,909
I like this one. No, this one's nighttime. It's time for sleep time. No, the default is okay. Dark.

88
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:06,389
I don't like the dark theme. All right. This one's fine. Or no, that's, you know, this is more chill.

89
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:13,029
I'll take it. Notifications. Sure. Sound, main volume. I don't really know what this

90
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:19,669
means yet. Screen. An 80. Yeah, I don't have a 4k monitor. Can't fucking laugh in my face.

91
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:30,570
New adventure. Name. You can have a random name? You guys even hear this? Oh shit, I'm an idiot.

92
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:45,500
There you go. Okay. Do we do random? Open juice. Open Dion. Bruno Hill. Mushy Sherry. Jack Twain.

93
00:11:47,340 --> 00:12:00,120
Dr. Milk. Jam Trey. Joan Cramp. You're Already. Paul Gifts. Ivan Yu. I like Ivan Yu.

94
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:13,720
His classes in this game? Zach Last. Dr. Milk. Third Bonnet. Apple Jr. Read a book. Pearl Twain.

95
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:30,840
Stern Twain. Eugene Much. I like Ivan Hill. Pearl Socks. Alvin 5000. Done. Okay. Adventure. Well

96
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,759
rounded character. Not great at anything. Not bad at anything. Makes sense. Warrior. Strong

97
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:40,409
character. Skilled with heavy weapons and armor. Wise character focused on magic and light armor.

98
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:47,539
Agile master many. So do you. This is like you play this game in the operating system. It's weird.

99
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,700
Or beast skin. An odd character. Strong and tough but has a bad reputation.

100
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:04,330
I like mage. I'm a mage. Portrait. Okay. Eyes. Does it look like me?

101
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:23,289
That's bigger than that. Let's see. Okay.

102
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:37,799
Bowl cut. That looks all right. I don't have like an old face, do I? Should I do the mustache?

103
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:54,789
Head shape? I'm just making that one image that was made of me with the mustache. Okay.

104
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:12,539
I actually like it. Hold on. Let me see the other hairstyles. I like this. I like that one too.

105
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:29,769
These are all good. All of these are good. No not bald. That's too easy. That's too easy though.

106
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:37,980
It really is. How can you have different hair color when you have a bald head? Okay. But better

107
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:48,840
eyebrows? Do we have the concerned eyebrows? Okay. Eyebrows and beard. What about ears?

108
00:14:50,740 --> 00:15:03,179
That's fine. What is custom? Oh you could import images. What? I don't have any custom images.

109
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:14,279
48 by 48? Do I have one of those? What do we do it? Do it. Import. How do you already have this?

110
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:25,000
That's not a 48 by 48 image. Yes we do. We do. Does somebody have a 48 by 48 picture of my face?

111
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:32,360
That's a number I've never heard before. Just draw one right now. One of your emotes. Well the

112
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:39,879
emotes are 50. They're not 48 by 48. Free size and emote. I've opened Photoshop. I don't want to

113
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:44,600
open up an Adobe program. Don't you know if you double click an Adobe program you're going to be

114
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:54,019
sitting there for four minutes while it opens? I don't have that kind of time. Just do it in paint.

115
00:15:54,019 --> 00:16:02,419
All right. Hold on. What should I use? Every time I open up an Adobe program I feel like I'm working

116
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:08,230
at NASA. And it's like oh booting up the supercomputer. Why do you have to tell me everything you're

117
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:16,070
loading? I don't care. Just load. Adobe products have a loading screen that cycles through a

118
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:22,389
million different text files. Like loading this. It's like I don't need that information.

119
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:27,610
Just open it. Wait you have one already? In the time it took me to talk about Adobe?

120
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:39,590
Is that 48 by 48? Okay fine. This doesn't even matter. I don't think this matters.

121
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:44,970
All right well fine. Where is it? Where to go? Right there? Okay.

122
00:16:47,110 --> 00:17:00,279
I need to hold on. Wait custom import. Why does it? It doesn't think this is an image.

123
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:10,789
How is this not an image? Please no. We're not just gonna we're not just gonna give.

124
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:21,480
I can't. Okay fine. Fine. Fine. That one is pretty. Is that 48 by 48?

125
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:41,299
All right. Okay. Okay. It works. It works. It works. What's this character?

126
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:53,940
Wait I can change the hair color? I can't believe this is actually a real image.

127
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:01,140
Okay when I when somebody first showed me this the first thing that I've read the comments. You

128
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,900
don't think I read comments. I sit there in my bed and I like bite my fingernails and I go what the

129
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:09,619
fuck are people saying? Somebody said I look like a default goldeneye enemy.

130
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:18,220
Or like a Nintendo 64 of NPC or something. And I was like ah I guess yeah that's true.

131
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:25,420
That is pretty true. All right Alvin 5000. Mage. Everyone gets the same world. I don't want to do

132
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:33,660
leaderboard. All right I'm pretty intelligent. This is accurate. Choose a starting gift plus

133
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:41,900
six health points, two magic points, or 20 gold. What's is more important? I don't know.

134
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:55,109
20 gold? It's 21 out of 20. Double click the world navigator to travel through the land of Kingsway.

135
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:03,640
Okay. What? The yellow circles on the map are math nodes.

136
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,960
Click a node to travel to its location or inspect it for more information.

137
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:17,910
Training room. Distance 112. Location boat.

138
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:26,759
Okay this is. There is a battle dummy.

139
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,400
Some locations have events that trigger when you arrive. You must deal with the event before you

140
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:37,019
can continue traveling. Okay. Attack?

141
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:45,509
When in a battle you can choose an available skill. Each skill has a special use

142
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:53,460
and some are faster than others. Press the skill to attack your target. To load it?

143
00:19:54,259 --> 00:20:04,009
Alvin 5000 attacks from one damage. There's a defense too? That's the load too I assume.

144
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:15,180
Defeated. You got plus five experience. What about loot? Oh nothing. This is cool. I like you can

145
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,819
actually move them too. Am I gonna get overwhelmed eventually? All right cool.

146
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:30,180
You will encounter battle. You will encounter. Oh this is fucking contrast man. I got contrast

147
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:35,619
dye in my blood. You will encounter. Why can I not say encounter? You will encounter battles

148
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:40,980
while traveling as well in events. If you encounter an enemy too powerful you can try to escape.

149
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:50,740
Okay so there's a chest right here. Training room. Distance? Okay boat.

150
00:20:56,569 --> 00:21:02,410
There's a supplies chest. There's a sign next to the chest that reads one free potion per adventure.

151
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:10,819
It says it's actually like on the desktop. That's cool. Double click my bag to view your items.

152
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:16,869
Click and drag to move items between bags. Bags have a limit to how much they can hold to only take

153
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:25,220
what you need. Is there, can I see that limit? Do I have to double, do I have to open this?

154
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:41,880
Just copy paste bag. Copy paste bag. Open bag. Copy potion. Paste potion. That's so funny.

155
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:47,319
Throw away bag. Is that supposed to be me? Music. Whoa hold on there's music.

156
00:21:48,759 --> 00:22:04,180
All right that's really loud but let me hold on. Let me fix that. I don't like this one.

157
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:37,160
Oh oh oh I think we found it. Oh absolutely we did. Let's get out of the boat. Turn to surface yeah.

158
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:46,309
Jesus. Take potion. What do you mean don't take the potion? Hold on what's this mean?

159
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:50,630
Pause? What's the taskbar do? Oh I have music. All right how do I turn it down?

160

I don't like all these windows open. Actually yeah I do. We'll keep this one open.

163
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:21,160
This is the king's land. The king's castle is to the east, right? But be careful traveling to the

164
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,319
east too quickly. There are powerful monsters closer to the king's castle so take your time

165
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:35,059
to get some experience on the way. What about the potion? What? You got a quest. What? Double

415
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:37,529
let me look at them all one vitality with the escape chance which who cares versus three strength

416
01:09:37,529 --> 01:09:55,979
and magic find probably there's a strength ring i'm not going to sell this yet though let's see

417
01:09:55,979 --> 01:10:07,189
how this works look at this axe minus 15 damage to demons plus 20 damage to bosses i could kill

418
01:10:08,149 --> 01:10:15,460
warrior or something strength is useless if you're a mage yeah but i i do find myself using

419
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:21,640
the regular swing sometimes at least initially here in the early game drop shield i could sell

420
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:43,899
this i'm not gonna drop it i could sell it how much is away drop the small shield how much

421
01:10:43,899 --> 01:11:02,140
i can sell this it's one gold oh all right well whatever nice okay i'm ready i can't wear this

04:07:19,430 --> 04:07:26,790

This is now I teleport. Thank you. I'll take it

1206
04:20:33,819 --> 04:20:37,809
Roach it's being guarded by a creature

1207
04:20:39,450 --> 04:20:53,659
Hey, it's a mimic limp rune spear of vitality book of apocalypse

1208
04:20:59,739 --> 04:21:01,739
16 vitality that's a lot

1209
04:21:02,219 --> 04:21:06,120
That's a huge amount of vitality

1210
04:21:06,719 --> 04:21:21,219
But okay. Hold on hear me out. Oh, I don't have an opportunity for this. Well, here's apocalypse

Damn it. Don't want this

1213
04:21:32,860 --> 04:21:35,379
Okay, I convert potions because I don't want those

1214
04:21:36,459 --> 04:21:54,940
Start drinking them. I can't drink if I drink more than one or two more of these. I mean, I'm dead or something

1215
04:21:55,659 --> 04:22:12,860
40 intelligence 41 intelligence. It's a mimic. Don't drink them. You will die. I know if can I drink one more though?

1216
04:22:13,739 --> 04:22:19,739
Only have one mana potion. This is really terrible. Actually, this is really really bad. I'm gonna have to run away and fight

1217
04:22:20,420 --> 04:22:40,260
Attack normally

1218
04:22:40,260 --> 04:23:02,379
This is not a good idea. This is bad idea, but it's kind of working

1219
04:23:03,620 --> 04:23:08,620
This is what about a bad idea. This was why did I listen to this person attack normally? Why did I listen?

1220
04:23:09,180 --> 04:23:11,020
What did I listen?

1221
04:23:11,020 --> 04:23:27,219
I'm dead. I only took 90% of my HP fuck

1222
04:23:32,559 --> 04:23:46,379
Doesn't take glass body and may lays on his mage. No, I'm just trying something just teleport

1223
04:23:46,780 --> 04:24:00,840
No, no, no, I can't I don't have any more mana. I got a level up again. I

1224
04:24:01,440 --> 04:24:03,629
Got a level up again

1225
04:24:03,629 --> 04:24:27,610
What do you not have anything on you? How do you have zero anything? Come on use the scrolls? I live one scroll

1226
04:24:28,250 --> 04:24:31,479
Chug attacks. I can't I'm not chugging attack

1227
04:24:32,639 --> 04:24:40,110
Which way I go. I am regening though. Thankfully. I'm not getting any random battles. That's good

1228
04:24:40,629 --> 04:24:44,389
Whatever it's a down

1229
04:24:47,440 --> 04:25:04,459
Wow, that's what a great move. Look at that. Look at that. Look at that. I need to kill one more person

1230
04:25:42,030 --> 04:25:46,450
Don't miss blocks

1231
04:25:46,649 --> 04:25:49,610
I'm a mage. I'm not supposed to be doing this in the first place

1232
04:25:50,770 --> 04:26:29,030
Apocalypse 2 no, okay. All right. All right. All right. I'm at the heritage. Okay

1233
04:26:31,299 --> 04:27:01,170
I can disenchant and I just chance something fuck

1234
04:27:01,770 --> 04:27:39,100
Attack potion and then pray that I can kill it with three healing potion potion of attack

1235
04:27:39,700 --> 04:27:42,649
You're not but I have

1236
04:27:43,170 --> 04:27:49,870
Disenchant disenchant disenchant what there's nothing else. We didn't chant the royal the royal dick

1237
04:27:49,889 --> 04:27:51,889
Thing I already did it's bugged

1238
04:27:52,129 --> 04:27:58,139
In fact get this away from me the orb. It's been no, I have disenchanted everything

1239
04:27:59,340 --> 04:28:01,840
Yeah, it just it's bugged

1240
04:28:03,059 --> 04:28:18,180
There's an enormous heart like organ it beats so heavily you can feel the area around you change shape and the air rush back and forth

1241
04:28:19,020 --> 04:28:29,319
Destroying this will surely destroy the sky eater with great force you managed to pierce the flesh of the heart

1242
04:28:29,799 --> 04:28:33,469
There is no blood but instead of rush of fresh air

1243
04:28:34,030 --> 04:28:39,940
It's beating slows and a lump on the side opens to reveal an eye twice the size of your head

1244
04:28:40,459 --> 04:28:46,000
You try to communicate with the alien, but there is no response

1245
04:28:46,879 --> 04:29:04,860
only attack

1246
04:29:06,540 --> 04:29:10,219
Killed you I win I win I

1247
04:29:10,780 --> 04:29:28,979
Didn't get hit heart completely stops. There is a perfect stillness for a moment before the room around you begins to shrink

1248
04:29:29,579 --> 04:29:41,229
And the for the room around you begins to shrink and the air sucked out from every direction

1249
04:29:41,709 --> 04:29:48,600
You try to escape, but the passage quickly becomes too small. The air is gone. You lose consciousness

1250
04:29:49,379 --> 04:30:21,250
Is that the bad end?

1251
04:30:21,489 --> 04:30:23,790
Did I kill him too fast?

1252
04:30:27,379 --> 04:30:32,819
Name alvin 5000 the martyr level 17 mage killed saving the world

1253
04:30:33,860 --> 04:30:40,420
Of time day two hours seven minutes 24 gems earned 136

worthless

1256
04:30:52,420 --> 04:30:54,420
Spend your gems to unlock new one

1257
04:30:55,059 --> 04:31:06,000
But you can unlock hot keys

1258

Master key, I get it

1261
04:31:20,370 --> 04:31:22,209
ring of pain

1262
04:31:22,209 --> 04:31:24,770
But this is how you play the game more than once

1263
04:31:25,649 --> 04:31:38,510
I want the pink theme

1264
04:31:38,510 --> 04:31:40,510
And I want the bone cursor

1265
04:31:42,190 --> 04:31:44,190

04:31:50,020 --> 04:31:55,219
10 health points plus four magic points and I want to be the master of a sword

1270
04:31:56,959 --> 04:31:58,959
Sword mastery

1271
04:31:58,959 --> 04:32:06,700
All right new adventurer

1272
04:32:07,659 --> 04:32:12,940
Whose class worthless a weak unintelligent poor vagabond with only one arm

1273
04:32:24,049 --> 04:32:33,780
I don't want that let's do adventure. Obviously. I'm just curious as to what the heck what the heck's going on here

1274
04:32:34,979 --> 04:32:37,790
He's a starting gift

1275
04:32:37,870 --> 04:32:39,149
Oh

1276
04:32:39,229 --> 04:32:41,229
I see

1277
04:32:43,409 --> 04:32:46,100
I see

1278
04:32:51,649 --> 04:32:53,649
Okay, let's just i'm just curious

1279
04:33:00,430 --> 04:33:02,430
Think or riot. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah

1280
04:33:04,189 --> 04:33:18,340
It's just I feel like a download my computer has a virus

1281
04:33:19,459 --> 04:33:40,240
Bone cursor I got all these things. I didn't turn them on screen. Okay

1282
04:33:41,919 --> 04:33:45,700
Nice

1283
04:33:45,779 --> 04:33:48,020
All right now we're really really going for it here

1284
04:33:49,540 --> 04:34:04,959
So ugly, well, this is fun. What's wrong with me?

1285
04:34:16,259 --> 04:34:23,169
Chill oh, I can't learn that I got a nail club though. Eugene gal

1286
04:34:24,610 --> 04:34:26,849
How black can I not use this

1287
04:34:26,849 --> 04:34:28,849
I just want to get the I just want to level up

1288
04:34:29,090 --> 04:34:32,159
I'm curious. I just want to level up

1289
04:34:35,919 --> 04:34:46,799
Approach the gang fight this character sucks

1290
04:34:47,840 --> 04:35:07,729
Now this is triple a gaming. Yeah, you can say that you can shield. Yeah, who cares? I'm but i'm gonna level up though

1291
04:35:14,139 --> 04:35:15,500
Hey kid

1292
04:35:15,500 --> 04:35:24,319
All right equip the sword. Oh, it's because of the way, but I don't know

1293
04:35:25,040 --> 04:35:26,900
strength

1294
04:35:26,900 --> 04:35:31,330
Oh, what do I need to do this? I need to be level three. Oh my god

1295
04:35:33,419 --> 04:35:34,779
Where's the sword?

1296
04:35:34,779 --> 04:35:46,560
I'm on fire. Am I am I gonna die right now? Am I dead here?

1297
04:35:47,279 --> 04:35:50,099
I'm gonna die here because of that

1298
04:36:06,509 --> 04:36:08,509
I I didn't have a weapon equipped

1299
04:36:10,290 --> 04:36:12,209
Saved the world

1300
04:36:12,209 --> 04:36:17,169
In one try and then died at the first encounter. That is very accurate

1301
04:36:17,970 --> 04:36:19,569
That's what happened

1302
04:36:19,569 --> 04:36:23,900
Can I like you want to bury them?

1303
04:36:24,540 --> 04:36:26,430
Yes

1304
04:36:26,430 --> 04:36:28,349
Who's a memento?

1305
04:36:28,349 --> 04:36:30,349
The club you couldn't use

1306
04:36:30,750 --> 04:36:42,909
Well, I can what should I bury I bury him put alvin to rest

1307
04:36:43,869 --> 04:36:49,439
Um, I think it's gonna have to be the northern northern mash

1308
04:36:50,479 --> 04:36:55,470
that turns around

1309
04:36:57,520 --> 04:37:01,790
Or the limp ring

1310
04:37:01,790 --> 04:37:04,189
Or um, I just I just get to keep his stuff

1311
04:37:05,069 --> 04:37:07,569
It goes to next of kin

1312
04:37:07,979 --> 04:37:11,340
I'm not gonna put the most powerful weapon in the world

1313
04:37:11,900 --> 04:37:13,819
into a coffin

1314
04:37:13,819 --> 04:37:17,200
It's mine now dad

1315
04:37:17,840 --> 04:37:30,139
But that's what you keep that. Oh, that's a good thing. I clicked it

1316
04:37:48,299 --> 04:37:58,720
Kylie kisser lunch lock. All right here take the best weapon in the game

1317
04:37:59,599 --> 04:38:02,319
Hey lunch lock take the best sword in the game

1318
04:38:04,540 --> 04:38:08,939
All right. I'm done. I'm not playing another one. I can say you can play this more than a few times though

1319
04:38:09,819 --> 04:38:14,349
Can you not use it?

1320
04:38:14,349 --> 04:38:17,680
In his inventory every level six

1321
04:38:23,779 --> 04:38:25,779
And the weapon is gone no, it's here

1322
04:38:28,979 --> 04:38:32,099
Here we go again with the end of the stream voice

1323
04:38:33,060 --> 04:38:36,639
Rhythm heaven tomorrow. Yes

1324
04:38:37,740 --> 04:38:39,740
Rhythm heaven is going to be tomorrow for the week

1325
04:38:41,439 --> 04:38:43,439
today was a

1326
04:38:45,490 --> 04:38:47,490
I was a little under the weather today

1327
04:38:48,290 --> 04:38:50,290
Because I had to go get an MRI done

1328
04:38:52,849 --> 04:38:53,970
So

1329
04:38:53,970 --> 04:38:55,970
Wasn't feeling a thousand percent today

1330
04:38:56,450 --> 04:38:59,599
But I did I wanted to stream and this was a requested game

1331
04:39:00,560 --> 04:39:09,040
So we'll leave it at that. Yes. I said yeah with contrast

1332
04:39:11,680 --> 04:39:13,680
uh, but I do have some

1333
04:39:14,799 --> 04:39:17,040
Uh potentially very interesting news for you

1334
04:39:20,400 --> 04:39:23,220
Joel has responded

1335
04:39:23,459 --> 04:39:27,150
And it looks like we're going to do keep talking and nobody explodes this weekend

1336
04:39:28,110 --> 04:39:32,139
I would assume we'll be doing that on

1337
04:39:32,860 --> 04:39:36,130
saturday

1338
04:39:36,130 --> 04:39:38,610
That would be nice make sense. Keep talking to nobody explode

1339
04:39:42,189 --> 04:39:44,189
another worst stream

1340
04:39:52,340 --> 04:39:59,099
Let's go worst stream 2020 no, I okay if the worst stream 2020

1341
04:40:00,060 --> 04:40:02,880
I mean, it's that's funny

1342
04:40:02,959 --> 04:40:04,000
That's funny

1343
04:40:04,000 --> 04:40:09,759
But I mean I and the mods go through all the nominations to see what's what and we you know take things out

1344
04:40:09,759 --> 04:40:11,759
Then maybe yeah that maybe that's the wrong category

1345
04:40:12,880 --> 04:40:18,479
Every every single worst stream of 2020 cannot be a stream that I streamed with Joel

1346
04:40:19,439 --> 04:40:24,419
That can't be every nominee. That is actually kind of funny though

1347
04:40:27,409 --> 04:40:30,369
So so i'm sorry, but that's not gonna happen

1348
04:40:31,090 --> 04:40:38,700
Community content night is also slated for saturday, but what i'm going to assume

1349
04:40:39,819 --> 04:40:41,380
is

1350
04:40:41,380 --> 04:40:43,380
when we played

1351
04:40:43,380 --> 04:40:45,840
last time

1352
04:40:45,840 --> 04:40:47,840
We only played for like an hour or two

1353
04:40:49,630 --> 04:40:52,990
Last uh, like a week or so ago when we did it. We only played for like an hour and a half

1354
04:40:53,950 --> 04:41:02,020
It's tomorrow. Well, technically saturday

1355
04:41:04,130 --> 04:41:06,819
Or maybe um

1356
04:41:06,819 --> 04:41:09,060
How long is rhythm heaven? How long is that game going to take to play?

1357
04:41:10,020 --> 04:41:12,020
Hold on. Let me look this up

1358
04:41:12,259 --> 04:41:19,040
How long is rhythm heaven it's long really

1359
04:41:21,520 --> 04:41:27,729
I always thought it was one of those games you could kind of

1360
04:41:28,909 --> 04:41:31,389
Holy shit. This is yeah, it's eight hours

1361
04:41:32,090 --> 04:41:36,430
16 hours for the extras and main game. Oh my jesus

1362
04:41:38,259 --> 04:41:45,439
Okay

1363
04:41:45,439 --> 04:41:48,479
Let me let me talk to him. Let me let me see what his what his schedule looks like

1364
04:41:49,360 --> 04:41:51,360
As if not saturday, then maybe we could do it

1365
04:41:52,080 --> 04:41:53,040
on

1366
04:41:53,040 --> 04:41:54,959
Sunday or monday or something

1367
04:41:54,959 --> 04:42:01,599
Don't cancel no, no, no, we're playing rhythm heaven tomorrow. I just didn't know it was that long

1368
04:42:02,319 --> 04:42:05,709
Probably two full streams to get through it

1369
04:42:07,919 --> 04:42:11,040
Let me let me see what his schedule looks like and we'll slate it for like

1370
04:42:11,979 --> 04:42:14,400
saturday sunday monday one of those days

1371
04:42:15,119 --> 04:42:18,110
streaming now

1372
04:42:18,110 --> 04:42:20,270
Maybe it'll be better to do that on like monday

1373
04:42:21,229 --> 04:42:29,250
I would say

1374
04:42:29,250 --> 04:42:34,209
Five minutes ago. He said he was playing it this weekend. Well that I I didn't realize that rhythm heaven was like a 10 hour game

1375
04:42:34,290 --> 04:42:36,290
I thought it was like four or three

1376
04:42:36,930 --> 04:42:42,720
I was under the assumption that rhythm heaven was less than three or four hours long

1377
04:42:43,840 --> 04:42:48,380
It's because it's very hard

1378
04:42:48,979 --> 04:42:50,979
Oh, i'm gonna love it then let's go

1379
04:42:51,700 --> 04:43:00,770
But tomorrow is going to be a very early stream

1380
04:43:01,569 --> 04:43:05,330
Not only is it rhythm heaven. It's starting at like 11 o'clock in the morning

1381
04:43:11,259 --> 04:43:12,220
so

1382
04:43:12,220 --> 04:43:16,750
There is that

1383
04:43:16,750 --> 04:43:18,860
But that's gonna be it

1384
04:43:18,860 --> 04:43:20,860
We do have

1385
04:43:20,939 --> 04:43:25,900
Um, I do want to briefly go over the bits from a few days ago

1386
04:43:26,619 --> 04:43:29,979
Because I was up really late and it was like a 13 and a half hour stream

1387
04:43:30,860 --> 04:43:32,540
so I do want to

1388
04:43:32,540 --> 04:43:33,900
at least

1389
04:43:33,900 --> 04:43:36,540
cover those

1390
04:43:36,540 --> 04:43:37,580
as

1391
04:43:37,580 --> 04:43:41,709
Much as I can

1392
04:43:41,709 --> 04:43:44,669
Based and like elicit. I don't even remember saying half of that shit

1393
04:43:48,299 --> 04:43:50,060
Gimli stream

1394
04:43:50,060 --> 04:43:52,139
No outro. Yeah. Yeah there there is

1395
04:43:54,580 --> 04:43:56,580
but i'm saying i'm gonna start with um

1396
04:43:57,759 --> 04:44:00,319
The bits and subs and everything or at least the bits that we missed

1397
04:44:02,299 --> 04:44:03,819
from a few years ago

1398
04:44:03,819 --> 04:44:10,610
It was about 13 hours worth

1399
04:44:14,430 --> 04:44:16,110
Get it open

1400
04:44:16,110 --> 04:44:18,110
But i'll see you guys tomorrow morning

1401
04:44:18,189 --> 04:44:22,509
bright and early pacific time in which 11 a.m. Is not really bright and early

1402
04:44:23,630 --> 04:44:24,669
but

1403
04:44:24,669 --> 04:44:26,669
It is earlier

1404
04:44:31,619 --> 04:44:33,619
You got a stream or so I can get my wink points

1405
04:44:34,990 --> 04:44:36,270
Yeah, I know

1406
04:44:36,270 --> 04:44:38,270
I do

1407
04:44:38,270 --> 04:44:40,270
Get some music playing

1408
04:44:44,619 --> 04:44:54,880
Irma wink grew pilled. All right, let's try to go through these in a timely manner

1409
04:44:57,020 --> 04:44:59,020
We had five dollars from an anonymous cheer

1410
04:44:59,659 --> 04:45:02,930
Just five dollars

1411
04:45:02,930 --> 04:45:08,130
It was a huge amount of community subs also. It's every stream. There's a bunch of community subs

1412
04:45:08,689 --> 04:45:10,689
At the beginning now because of the hype train

1413
04:45:12,529 --> 04:45:14,209
Thank you so much guys

1414
04:45:14,209 --> 04:45:16,209
You guys every fucking day

1415
04:45:16,689 --> 04:45:21,409
Dump huge amounts of money on this stream and now there's this incentive for a hype train

1416
04:45:23,919 --> 04:45:26,130
Thanks guys

1417
04:45:26,130 --> 04:45:32,130
We had 250 from ipod matt. I said germa. I can't do this anymore any more hype and i'm gonna spontaneously combust

1418
04:45:32,770 --> 04:45:36,930
And he says thanks dude, and he smashes his keyboard and it was him exploding

1419
04:45:38,689 --> 04:45:42,209
Hey cad, thanks for the 250 cad

1420
04:45:42,770 --> 04:45:44,930
Is this the hype train for the bathtub stream?

1421
04:45:46,139 --> 04:45:51,950
No, I ain't ever getting in a bath on stream. You know that horror story that happened in my made-up reality

1422
04:45:54,830 --> 04:45:56,830

1423
04:45:57,569 --> 04:45:59,970
Thank you near shoe potion dweller. Thanks for 250

1424
04:46:01,860 --> 04:46:05,860
I'm, so sick of these hype trains. They're genius because they're making you so much money though

1425
04:46:06,099 --> 04:46:08,099
Even though I can tell you don't want them

1426
04:46:09,520 --> 04:46:12,880
well, if it's not that I don't want something like that to happen, it's just

1427
04:46:14,669 --> 04:46:16,669
Uh, i'm gonna keep increasing

1428
04:46:17,389 --> 04:46:22,180
the difficulty

1429
04:46:22,180 --> 04:46:24,180
For them to happen in the first place

1430
04:46:24,659 --> 04:46:27,279
So it doesn't happen every single time

1431
04:46:28,659 --> 04:46:31,860
But I mean right so he hates money. No, but listen

1432
04:46:32,580 --> 04:46:34,080
there's

1433
04:46:34,080 --> 04:46:37,599
There's all right. There's a sub train every single stream

1434
04:46:38,479 --> 04:46:42,159
And it's like that's very very good for me. That's a lot of money

1435
04:46:42,959 --> 04:46:44,959
But I never I don't want to

1436
04:46:45,360 --> 04:46:48,080
Have people think that that's something that they have to do every day

1437
04:46:52,689 --> 04:46:56,930
So I I I increased it a little bit as of the last two days. So i'm gonna

1438
04:46:57,569 --> 04:47:01,330
Make it i'm gonna raise the challenge a little bit to make it so it doesn't happen

1439
04:47:01,889 --> 04:47:05,889
As often and it might take a little bit more time and might be more difficult to do

1440
04:47:06,770 --> 04:47:10,419
The rain pisses him off

1441
04:47:10,580 --> 04:47:15,380
Stream every day for a hype train every day

1442
04:47:16,659 --> 04:47:23,180

1446
04:47:34,479 --> 04:47:36,479
All those things are incredibly difficult

1447
04:47:37,119 --> 04:47:42,340
German do you know that germa doesn't know how to chat? Hey chat, you know, germa doesn't know how to drive a car

1448

04:49:29,709 --> 04:49:38,939
That's the only one that's gonna happen. I don't like it. I'm not doing it again

1462
04:49:41,840 --> 04:49:45,740
That wasn't worth it

1463
04:49:49,259 --> 04:49:51,259
Of course, it's not worth it

1464
04:49:52,500 --> 04:49:54,099
Of course not

1465
04:49:54,099 --> 04:50:07,779

I thought I loved the hype train ride

1475
04:51:04,930 --> 04:51:10,209
But on my third train I started noticing the wires coming out of the streamer and the voice modifier he had

1476
04:51:10,849 --> 04:51:18,450
Even the starting soon planets are actually just pre-recorded footage. Honestly sucked all of the hype out of it. Thank you feels bad, man

Wait, he likes the thing that gets him

1505

Isn't pizza hut doing real bad, by the way?

1509
04:53:41,900 --> 04:53:46,689
I heard they were going under that true. I mean it was like one of

1510
04:53:47,330 --> 04:53:48,830
the

1511
04:53:48,830 --> 04:53:51,569
17 000 watch mojo videos. Is that for real?

1512
04:54:03,740 --> 04:54:06,540
They started charging an extra one dollar for their original crust

1513
04:54:07,979 --> 04:54:09,419
scumbags

1514
04:54:09,419 --> 04:54:10,939
How could they?

1515
04:54:10,939 --> 04:54:17,389
It's like when subway made the five dollar footlong and then made it the six dollar footlong and then made it the seven dollar footlong

1516
04:54:18,830 --> 04:54:24,029
And then they said oh shit, we'll do the five dollar footlong again, but it's only like four sandwiches

1517
04:54:24,750 --> 04:54:30,849
Got that from a watch mojo video. It's not even watch mojo

1518
04:54:31,569 --> 04:54:33,569
What's it? There's another one. It's called like

04:54:33,650 --> 04:54:37,409
There's like three of them that make the same videos and they have the same person that talks

1520
04:54:43,490 --> 04:54:45,549
mojo watch

1521
04:54:45,549 --> 04:54:50,619
looper

1522
04:54:50,619 --> 04:54:52,689
Yeah, they

1523
04:54:52,689 --> 04:54:54,689
No, not much not matching mojo

1524
04:54:57,069 --> 04:54:59,069
All right side. I don't there's a lot

1525
04:54:59,310 --> 04:55:01,310
And they all have the same person talking

1526
04:55:01,630 --> 04:55:05,919
It's that same lady. It's that same girl

1527
04:55:09,970 --> 04:55:15,169
We make videos every single day. So click on that bell. It's the same person in every video

1528

1529
04:55:28,340 --> 04:55:30,340
We make videos every single day

1530
04:55:31,139 --> 04:55:40,189
Are people still telling you to click on the bell?

1531
04:55:41,229 --> 04:55:43,729
in every video

1532
04:55:43,729 --> 04:55:45,729
You know, let me I I got I have to say this

1533
04:55:48,049 --> 04:55:51,729
How stupid do people think that the audience is?

1534
04:55:53,090 --> 04:55:55,090
That they have to be told

1535
04:55:55,330 --> 04:55:56,369
every

1536
04:55:56,369 --> 04:55:59,279

1537
04:55:59,279 --> 04:56:01,779
To click on the bell

1538
04:56:01,779 --> 04:56:05,709
every single day

1539
04:56:05,709 --> 04:56:08,130
Remember click on that bell to get notifications

1540
04:56:09,229 --> 04:56:12,029
Oh, okay

1541
04:56:12,029 --> 04:56:17,229
For 364 days i'm going to tell you to do that because I don't trust that you're going to do it

1542
04:56:21,779 --> 04:56:26,099
Not like once a week felt like once every like other video no, no every single video

1543
04:56:32,459 --> 04:56:34,459
But it's because of the new people

1544
04:56:38,240 --> 04:56:43,650
Uh, do you know how many of those new people don't aren't even not even logged into youtube?

1545
04:56:51,810 --> 04:56:53,009
What bell?

1546
04:56:53,009 --> 04:56:56,770
Somebody just shared this video with me. I'm gonna make an account to click a bell

1547
04:56:57,729 --> 04:56:59,169
That's not gonna happen

1548
04:56:59,169 --> 04:57:15,439
Smash the like button. Yeah, but the the bell is youtube decided that they were gonna make people's videos not show up

1549
04:57:15,439 --> 04:57:21,919
So you have to click another subscription button to be able to get people's videos. Is that what that's it, right?

1550
04:57:22,959 --> 04:57:26,659
Hey, you subscribe to this person

1551
04:57:26,740 --> 04:57:30,689
You want to see their videos?

1552
04:57:30,689 --> 04:57:34,799
Be sure

1553
04:57:34,799 --> 04:57:36,799
What they should probably have done

1554
04:57:37,279 --> 04:57:41,119
Is shouldn't they just have like a pop-up come up that says? Oh, hey, by the way

1555
04:57:41,599 --> 04:57:43,680
Uh notice you haven't watched the last

1556
04:57:44,939 --> 04:57:46,939
475 watch mojo videos

1557
04:57:47,439 --> 04:57:50,720
Do you still want to say subscribe to them and that person could go?

1558
04:57:51,860 --> 04:57:53,860
Oh, fuck. Yeah

1559
04:57:54,450 --> 04:57:58,610
No, I guess not

1560
04:57:58,610 --> 04:58:00,580
Why does it have to?

1561
04:58:00,580 --> 04:58:03,139
Oh, by the way, this has been it's been three days. It's been three days

1562
04:58:03,779 --> 04:58:11,490
Oh, so, uh dear germa985. We've noticed that uh, you haven't in the last four days have not watched

1563
04:58:12,450 --> 04:58:14,610
Six years worth of videos from watch mojo

1564
04:58:17,709 --> 04:58:19,709
Oh, uh, okay

1565
04:58:21,869 --> 04:58:34,290
YouTube doesn't want to encourage you to cut down on potential watch time though. It's a lot to make that many videos, man

1566
04:58:34,290 --> 04:58:36,369
I can't I couldn't even think about it

1567
04:58:38,430 --> 04:58:42,750
After I make one I don't know. There's like a team of people but after I made a video back in the day

1568
04:58:43,630 --> 04:58:45,950
I was just I was done

1569
04:58:45,950 --> 04:58:49,790
I was done. I want to make one of these for like at least two days. I'm fucking tired

1570
04:58:50,590 --> 04:58:59,029
I clicked the bell on your youtube channel, but it must not be working because i'm not getting any notifications

1571
04:59:01,009 --> 04:59:03,009
Oh shit, the sub boxes are broken

1572
04:59:07,360 --> 04:59:09,360
Wait, hold on you you didn't get my last

1573
04:59:10,080 --> 04:59:13,680
Five videos in a row that were top 10 scariest abandoned buildings

1574
04:59:14,639 --> 04:59:32,930
Uh, well, i'm sorry to hear that you should have am I gonna play kenshi? No, I've closed the book on that

1575
04:59:33,740 --> 04:59:35,700
Okay

1576
04:59:35,700 --> 04:59:37,779
Last three videos were doctor's appointments

1577
04:59:39,950 --> 04:59:41,950
Yeah. All right. Let's keep going

1578
04:59:42,270 --> 04:59:50,189
Uh sell thanks for the ten dollars thousand bits from sell thousand bits from yoko thousand bits from lmm, man

1579
04:59:50,990 --> 04:59:52,990
All of you. Thank you

1580
04:59:53,310 --> 04:59:57,549
They say fueling the train. That's yoko. Uh nova saying fueling the train while i'm here though

1581
04:59:57,869 --> 05:00:03,229
What part of massachusetts are you from you say boston, but that's what everybody says from i'm from well, um

1582
05:00:04,349 --> 05:00:09,069
There's a reason why people on the internet don't give uh direct echo locations of where they live

1583
05:00:14,900 --> 05:00:15,619
so

1584
05:00:15,619 --> 05:00:18,580
Uh, this question is uh, when i'm not going to answer

1585
05:00:19,220 --> 05:00:32,689
But you don't live there. My family does my friend. You know what I mean? Like it's

1586
05:00:33,569 --> 05:00:37,729
Hey, you don't live there anymore. You can just like uh, what if yeah, no one will care

1587
05:00:42,110 --> 05:00:44,110
No, but actually what you don't understand is

1588
05:00:44,669 --> 05:00:46,669
You do what you have it, right?

1589
05:00:46,669 --> 05:00:49,009
It was boston

1590
05:00:49,009 --> 05:00:51,090
city of boston inside the city

1591
05:00:52,209 --> 05:00:54,209
I've rode the train everywhere

1592
05:00:55,810 --> 05:00:57,330
I ate hot dogs

1593
05:00:57,330 --> 05:01:04,240
What does that I don't know what that has to do with anything

1594
05:01:14,610 --> 05:01:16,610
Inside city limits confirmed

1595
05:01:21,090 --> 05:01:25,520
But I appreciate the ten dollars though. Aren't you from rural mass?

1596
05:01:29,180 --> 05:01:31,180
What do you mean rural mass

1597
05:01:33,599 --> 05:01:35,599
This is not it's not like

1598
05:01:35,599 --> 05:01:37,599
It's not like mississippi

1599
05:01:46,689 --> 05:01:51,810
Oh, I guess no, I guess that is right. I guess that is well, not you know what I mean like this

1600
05:01:53,290 --> 05:01:57,709
Population per square mile all the way in western mass is one to ten

1601
05:01:59,409 --> 05:02:02,479
What?

1602
05:02:02,479 --> 05:02:07,009
Wait a minute population per square mile one to ten

1603
05:02:09,439 --> 05:02:11,840
one person potentially per mile

1604
05:02:15,619 --> 05:02:20,610
That's ridiculous

1605
05:02:20,610 --> 05:02:26,380
Well squared mile squared mile squared mile

1606
05:02:27,259 --> 05:02:30,209
Dude, are you guys excited for the xfl?

1607
05:02:31,009 --> 05:02:33,009
I can't wait for the xfl

1608
05:02:34,750 --> 05:02:36,430
Like that's gonna be

1609
05:02:36,430 --> 05:02:39,310
I can't wait the xfl is coming back in a week

1610
05:02:40,189 --> 05:02:42,430
I didn't even know this was happening

1611
05:02:42,430 --> 05:02:47,259
This is the moment in the xfl where like there's no fair catch and people just run into each other and like

1612
05:02:47,500 --> 05:02:49,819
Roche it at each other didn't they get no it's back

1613
05:02:57,380 --> 05:02:59,380
Two forward passes are allowed

1614
05:03:02,020 --> 05:03:04,020
Yeah, and they have a they have a shootout

1615
05:03:04,979 --> 05:03:07,729
If there's overtime

1616
05:03:07,729 --> 05:03:10,290
Like soccer or you know football

1617
05:03:11,630 --> 05:03:14,020
It's gonna be like hockey

1618
05:03:14,020 --> 05:03:16,740
That's gonna be ridiculous. I I can't wait

1619
05:03:21,169 --> 05:03:23,729
I I really I don't care that much about sports that much

1620
05:03:24,529 --> 05:03:25,779
but

1621
05:03:25,779 --> 05:03:28,099
I feel like it could be entertaining to watch just

1622
05:03:28,900 --> 05:03:33,060
You only need one foot in bounds to make it catch. It's a college rule

1623
05:03:35,869 --> 05:03:37,709
What's wrong with me?

1624
05:03:37,709 --> 05:03:40,659
I'm talking about the the xfl

1625
05:03:41,220 --> 05:03:44,099
of the new football league from vince mcmahon that was

1626
05:03:45,060 --> 05:03:52,900
Lasted one season back in 2002. It was a disaster. That's coming back

1627
05:03:58,479 --> 05:04:02,000
There was like four injuries every single game in the xfl

1628
05:04:03,919 --> 05:04:08,240
I don't I think I gotta like read the rules, but is is this coming back?

1629
05:04:09,040 --> 05:04:15,360
Why aren't you from boston? I thought you liked baseball. I do but I mean I don't watch

1630
05:04:16,159 --> 05:04:19,439
Every single game or anything if i'll catch it if it's on

1631
05:04:21,470 --> 05:04:23,470
I do like baseball. I do very much

1632
05:04:23,709 --> 05:04:31,939
It's like the football game you played that was half mortal combat what's the league one of the greatest

1633
05:04:32,740 --> 05:04:35,619
Video games ever speaking of great speaking of sports

1634
05:04:37,009 --> 05:04:41,330
I didn't even tell you guys this but over here. I have a very special game

I've got quite the collection over here of video games

1638
05:04:56,959 --> 05:04:58,959
They're just waiting to be played

1639
05:05:05,540 --> 05:05:07,459
Both beautiful joes

1640
05:05:07,459 --> 05:05:10,400
Not a big deal. Don't worry

1641
05:05:10,479 --> 05:05:16,990
What's that? Oh begaman legends one and two over there hanging up

1642
05:05:23,069 --> 05:05:25,069

And tony hawks underground too

1646
05:05:39,009 --> 05:05:40,450
I went nuts

1647
05:05:40,450 --> 05:05:51,500
And some other stuff, you know underground is the best

1648
05:05:52,139 --> 05:05:54,770
When are you gonna do the diablo 2 hardcore?

1649
05:05:56,099 --> 05:05:58,099
When I get a little less busy

1650
05:05:59,729 --> 05:06:01,650
It's gonna start to get

1651
05:06:01,650 --> 05:06:03,650
Really really busy for me

1652
05:06:05,340 --> 05:06:07,340
i'm trying to not

1653
05:06:07,560 --> 05:06:09,659
overthink this and overthink anything here, but

1654
05:06:10,720 --> 05:06:12,720
Over the next three or four weeks

1655
05:06:13,119 --> 05:06:14,720
I'm going to be very busy

1656
05:06:14,720 --> 05:06:21,279
I wanted to make sure I had a bunch of stuff ready to go lined up

1657
05:06:21,919 --> 05:06:27,619
No, no, no, no, no, no, there's no

1658
05:06:28,259 --> 05:06:32,349
There's no there's no baby

1659
05:06:33,069 --> 05:06:35,250
Let's just quell that one immediately

1660
05:06:41,340 --> 05:06:43,580
Do you have any special videos that you mentioned were in the process?

1661
05:06:44,459 --> 05:06:46,459
Uh, they've turned into streams

1662
05:06:47,259 --> 05:06:49,259
And yes, there is at least one

1663
05:06:50,479 --> 05:06:53,040
Very very very major project that is

1664
05:06:53,919 --> 05:06:55,520
Getting off the ground now

1665
05:06:55,520 --> 05:07:02,299
It's gonna be crazy

1666
05:07:04,509 --> 05:07:06,509
It is not the rumble 2

1667
05:07:06,990 --> 05:07:10,430
Although there are plans to try to do that

1668
05:07:13,240 --> 05:07:15,020
Hopefully

1669
05:07:15,020 --> 05:07:17,259
if not in 2020 then

1670
05:07:17,819 --> 05:07:19,819
very early into 2021

1671
05:07:25,869 --> 05:07:27,869
Then that stream

1672
05:07:28,430 --> 05:07:31,700

1673
05:07:31,700 --> 05:07:33,380

1744
05:13:19,790 --> 05:13:22,139
Yep, I did

1745
05:13:22,139 --> 05:13:28,139
And reinville if you're watching now talking about putting the greedy grinner in a magic the gathering card

1746
05:13:28,860 --> 05:13:35,599
The greedy grinner actually being in a magic the gathering game

1747
05:13:37,020 --> 05:13:39,020
I would love to talk about that

1748
05:13:39,580 --> 05:13:46,799
I'm, not sure if you hit me up yet, but if you if you're just messing around you just meme in here then okay

1749
05:13:47,520 --> 05:13:49,520
But if you mean business

1750
05:13:50,240 --> 05:13:51,680
Call my manager

1751
05:13:51,680 --> 05:13:52,560

1752
05:13:52,560 --> 05:14:00,930
That number is

1753
05:14:00,930 --> 05:14:05,599
1558

1754
05:14:08,979 --> 05:14:19,840
Two the long number

1755
05:14:19,840 --> 05:14:21,200
He didn't believe it

1756
05:14:21,200 --> 05:14:24,020
That would be so stupid

1757
05:14:24,020 --> 05:14:35,470
Wait, that's my number

1758
05:14:36,270 --> 05:14:41,580
155

1759
05:14:41,740 --> 05:14:48,110
But how can it be yours that's mine, I know i'm sorry just said your phone number

1760
05:14:48,669 --> 05:14:50,669
Imagine hearing your phone number over stream

1761
05:14:55,569 --> 05:15:00,610
Getting sidetracked. All right. Fuck. I'm sorry greedy grinner in magic the gathering reinville hit me up. We'll talk

1762
05:15:02,639 --> 05:15:09,599
Uh lm man. Thanks for the 400 bits. That's a reward for beating the first part of fellowship. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes sob

1763
05:15:10,159 --> 05:15:12,159
kai sob cryo

1764
05:15:13,119 --> 05:15:17,200
Thank you sob for the thousand bits as a kid me and my brother used to play this game an insane amount

1765
05:15:17,919 --> 05:15:19,919
But for some reason in our copy

1766
05:15:20,000 --> 05:15:22,000
Of the game it was impossible to save

1767
05:15:22,479 --> 05:15:25,680
So what we did is just play as far as we could every time without dying

1768
05:15:26,240 --> 05:15:28,240
Because then we'd have to start from the very beginning

1769
05:15:28,959 --> 05:15:34,880
This made the nazgul among other things so scary and that one time I got all the way to

1770
05:15:36,000 --> 05:15:38,319
Moira it was so fucking fog

1771
05:15:39,599 --> 05:15:42,000
That I had my brother come home from school to watch

1772
05:15:42,959 --> 05:15:44,959
Anyways, thanks for the insane nostalgia

1773
05:15:45,919 --> 05:15:51,819
The game is so hard. It's just so hard and so chunky and

1774
05:15:52,619 --> 05:15:54,619
But it still kind of holds up

1775
05:15:59,119 --> 05:16:04,080
Shanji again a ten thousand bits. I think we went over it but a fucking hundred dollars

1776
05:16:04,639 --> 05:16:07,680
They said I was going to ask if you realize you've invaded into playing a game

1777
05:16:07,680 --> 05:16:09,360
That's basically just a short joke

1778
05:16:09,360 --> 05:16:13,919
But then you confused candy for fruit and asked if dropping an ipad in the tub could kill you

1779
05:16:14,080 --> 05:16:16,880
So yeah, here's to my favorite century gun. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

1780
05:16:17,599 --> 05:16:19,500
Thank you

1781
05:16:19,500 --> 05:16:27,700
Thank you

1782
05:16:29,299 --> 05:16:35,799
Hey sneak man, thanks for 300 bits germa's gamer challenge every saturday at 4 p.m. Central only on twitch.tv

1783
05:16:37,540 --> 05:16:44,000
I love okay, you can tell when

1784
05:16:44,400 --> 05:16:51,119
I was losing my mind and having a problem and freaking out and people may have been getting concerned because you get um

1785
05:16:52,000 --> 05:16:54,639
You get comments like this and I actually don't even remember this

1786
05:16:55,520 --> 05:17:01,279
But I think i'm the meme machine gave 5 000 bits so they gave 50 dollars

1787
05:17:02,080 --> 05:17:04,000
Which is huge

1788
05:17:04,000 --> 05:17:08,319
And they said for the love of all that is holy germa. You finished the first level of the game

1789
05:17:08,959 --> 05:17:15,599
I'm literally paying you 25 times the wager of the bet for you to go play with joel instead of dragging this out. Holy shit

1790
05:17:17,950 --> 05:17:19,549
that was

1791
05:17:19,549 --> 05:17:23,279
just about

1792
05:17:23,279 --> 05:17:24,880
seven hours

1793
05:17:24,880 --> 05:17:26,880
Before the stream actually turned off

1794
05:17:30,509 --> 05:17:32,669
I think the stream went on for another eight hours after that

1795
05:17:33,310 --> 05:17:44,900
Flushy 400 bits play with joel. We would both enjoy that more

1796
05:17:45,939 --> 05:17:47,939
And well, that'll happen soon. Don't worry

1797
05:17:49,470 --> 05:17:51,470

Please tell him he has fans and that bf stands for best friends to us

1805
05:18:24,799 --> 05:18:28,080
Also, as I was getting in the shower, I heard you say that your birthday was hobbit day

1806
05:18:29,119 --> 05:18:35,520
I laughed so hard as we realized you will never escape the compact streamer meme and fate conspires against you

1807
05:18:36,610 --> 05:18:38,610
Yeah, and today

1808
05:18:38,610 --> 05:18:42,450
Yes, and today I had a little bit of a meltdown about

1809
05:18:43,409 --> 05:18:47,650
Yeah, I had a little bit of an issue today. Yes. I did. I'm not gonna lie

1810
05:18:48,930 --> 05:18:54,209
I I saw I I went off a little bit. I've got a little irritated. That's what happens

1811
05:18:55,169 --> 05:19:04,000
That's what happens when people throw darts at you. He's smalting

1812
05:19:08,619 --> 05:19:17,220
There was a little issue it was a little issue find me a clip of it being of more than a little issue

1813
05:19:18,180 --> 05:19:20,540
It was just a small issue

1814
05:19:20,540 --> 05:19:25,900
I told one person to fuck off right? That's what happened. I pretty I said hey, fuck you or something. What happened?

1815
05:19:28,959 --> 05:19:34,479
There were 5000 people here today. I one person I said hey get out of here. Why what did I do? Did I do that?

1816
05:19:42,830 --> 05:19:45,229
I didn't ban anybody. I don't I don't

1817
05:19:47,229 --> 05:19:50,060
I don't ban anybody

1818
05:19:50,060 --> 05:20:06,369
My mods do or uh bad things that people do you banned him for a day and then modded him for a week

1819
05:20:07,169 --> 05:20:11,340
I did say that

1820
05:20:11,340 --> 05:20:19,500
Oh, but yeah, bf bugleberry does have some fans. I'm one of them. He knows that

1821
05:20:20,220 --> 05:20:22,220
Chowder man. Thanks for the thousand bits chowder man

1822
05:20:22,299 --> 05:20:25,099
Hey, I remember you mentioned you were thinking of playing outer wilds the other night

1823
05:20:25,099 --> 05:20:27,819
And if you're still considering it, I highly recommend it. I am and I will

1824
05:20:28,619 --> 05:20:35,180
For the most part the next let's see

1825
05:20:36,060 --> 05:20:41,180
Let's go over. Let me see. I'm just i'm curious myself. He's getting sidetracked again. Why did you do this?

1826
05:20:41,740 --> 05:20:47,150
Don't do this getting sidetracked just fucking do the rest dude. Oh my god. He's already got it open

1827
05:20:47,869 --> 05:20:50,110
Let's see. Uh, one two three four

1828
05:20:58,830 --> 05:21:03,090
um, I have

1829
05:21:03,090 --> 05:21:04,990
planned out

1830
05:21:04,990 --> 05:21:06,189
the next

1831
05:21:06,189 --> 05:21:07,869
at least

1832
05:21:07,869 --> 05:21:09,790
30 to 40 streams

1833
05:21:09,790 --> 05:21:11,790
Of the things that I know what i'm going to do

1834
05:21:13,330 --> 05:21:16,930
I'd say I'd say I have about 30 streams worth of stuff just ready

1835
05:21:17,889 --> 05:21:22,529
So I don't have to go. Oh, what should I do now? What should I do today? I planned out a lot of stuff

1836
05:21:26,029 --> 05:21:27,630
Bugleberry is hot

1837
05:21:27,630 --> 05:21:31,180
That's my opinion. That's your opinion. You can have that's fine. You can have any opinion you want

1838
05:21:31,740 --> 05:21:37,250
Whatever you think whatever the I mean he's handsome, right?

1839
05:21:37,810 --> 05:21:43,310
No one said that. Yes, I did look it up in the logs swiggity swanky. Thanks for the 250

1840
05:21:43,310 --> 05:21:44,110
This game takes me back

1841
05:21:44,110 --> 05:21:49,069
There was a game boy advanced game of both the two towers and return of the king which played as a diablo clone

1842
05:21:49,790 --> 05:21:51,790
Good times diablo 2 hardcore

1843
05:21:52,189 --> 05:21:54,189
Uh until I die

1844
05:21:54,509 --> 05:21:56,369
Is a stream as well

1845
05:21:56,369 --> 05:21:58,369
I'll be playing that should be fun

1846
05:22:00,060 --> 05:22:04,380
Chad is going to here's the thing about that. That's what you need to make it a little more interesting

1847
05:22:04,860 --> 05:22:06,860
Chad is going to pick the class

1848
05:22:06,860 --> 05:22:08,860
And pick every single skill point

1849
05:22:09,580 --> 05:22:10,540
so

1850
05:22:10,540 --> 05:22:20,930
Make it a little more interesting. I give it 10 minutes

1851
05:22:24,930 --> 05:22:28,209
Are you doing that because you do not want to win i'm doing it so I can prove

1852
05:22:28,770 --> 05:22:30,770
That no matter what anybody throws at me

1853
05:22:31,569 --> 05:22:33,569
Diablo 2 is my

1854
05:22:33,810 --> 05:22:35,810
Favorite video game top five ever

1855
05:22:36,130 --> 05:22:37,409
I can deal with anything you throw at me

1856
05:22:37,409 --> 05:22:40,130
I you don't think I know the synergies for every single fucking item in that game

1857
05:22:40,689 --> 05:22:43,650
You don't think I know every single item every single skill

1858
05:22:44,930 --> 05:22:47,869
Oh, let's let's make him a sorceress

1859
05:22:48,349 --> 05:22:50,830
And put 20 points into warmth. I can deal with that

1860
05:22:51,549 --> 05:22:53,709
In fact, I hope you do that reverse psychology do it

1861
05:22:54,349 --> 05:22:55,630
See what happens

1862
05:22:55,630 --> 05:23:00,819
Oh shit, he actually knows the skills

1863
05:23:06,590 --> 05:23:07,790
Hey cad

05:23:07,790 --> 05:23:09,470
Chad you're here. I saw you

1865
05:23:09,470 --> 05:23:13,250
I hear this is the stream to watch bootleg movies. Keep up the great work homerad

1866
05:23:26,740 --> 05:23:28,740
Yeah, that's funny

1867
05:23:28,819 --> 05:23:31,299
That's funny

1868
05:23:31,299 --> 05:23:34,740
All the shit. All right, if you look up who's watching a movie right now

1869
05:23:35,380 --> 05:23:37,380
If you watch it like a load of things

1870
05:23:45,889 --> 05:23:48,369
That stream was funny the stream was a lot of fun

1871
05:23:49,169 --> 05:23:59,279
But thank you cat. Thank you orange julian for the five and a bit cheers to your gamer snack. It was delicious. Thank you

1872
05:23:59,919 --> 05:24:02,799
Jerma's pet ferret. I don't have a pet ferret, but thank you for the five dollars

1873
05:24:03,599 --> 05:24:07,740
Appreciate it. They say hey jerma. I'm samey

1874
05:24:08,299 --> 05:24:13,340
Or saime. I suffer from swelling and pain in both of my hands. It makes it almost impossible to use them some days

1875
05:24:14,139 --> 05:24:16,939
I'm a writer artist and a gamer and I work with dogs

1876
05:24:18,139 --> 05:24:20,740
Pretty awesome

1877
05:24:20,740 --> 05:24:24,860
I used to work with dogs too. I volunteered at an animal shelter. It's awesome

1878
05:24:24,939 --> 05:24:27,180
I highly recommend it if anybody has not done it before

1879
05:24:27,900 --> 05:24:31,310
I've seen countless doctors still no definite answer. I'm very proactive and sitting

1880
05:24:31,869 --> 05:24:37,150
Around doing nothing is hard on my mental health hate feeling useless and helpless, but your streams vods and videos

1881
05:24:37,630 --> 05:24:40,990
Sincerely help keep me sane and positive. You're a light in the dark times

1882
05:24:41,549 --> 05:24:47,119
Thank you

1883
05:24:47,119 --> 05:24:49,119
Thank you for the 500 bits first of all

1884
05:24:51,790 --> 05:24:56,209
and second of all

1885
05:24:56,209 --> 05:24:58,290
just know that

1886
05:24:58,290 --> 05:24:59,729
most people

1887
05:24:59,729 --> 05:25:02,529
Are going through something

1888
05:25:02,529 --> 05:25:09,020
There are I think a lot of people forget that I think a lot of people don't remember that and don't realize that you know

1889
05:25:11,009 --> 05:25:13,009
and if you can collectively

1890
05:25:13,659 --> 05:25:17,259
You know, that's why I like to tell people about but jerma. Why do you tell people about this?

1891
05:25:17,500 --> 05:25:20,700
Oh, why why'd you tell me about like all the things happening in your life that aren't very good?

1892
05:25:21,580 --> 05:25:25,360
It's because I I want to be a real person

1893
05:25:25,840 --> 05:25:33,099
You guys know I want you to know that there there there are bad things that happen in everybody's lives essentially

1894
05:25:35,490 --> 05:25:39,810
There are good things and there are bad things and I think that talking about the bad things

1895
05:25:41,740 --> 05:25:56,689
Let's us all know that we're human. So that's one of the reasons why sometimes I do share

1896
05:25:58,049 --> 05:26:02,770
Things that aren't really going great for medical problems like you have yourself as well

1897
05:26:03,650 --> 05:26:11,360
I wish you the best

1898
05:26:11,360 --> 05:26:13,360
I wish you the absolute best

1899
05:26:16,259 --> 05:26:18,259
Thanks for watching. Thanks for being here

1900
05:26:18,500 --> 05:26:21,040
And keep going

1901
05:26:21,040 --> 05:26:34,040
As best as you can moving on from that we had five dollars from mishanji

1902
05:26:34,979 --> 05:26:37,139
recipe for jerma jerky smoothie when

1903
05:26:38,099 --> 05:26:41,459
Uh, it's called open a bag of crave beef jerky

1904
05:26:42,340 --> 05:26:47,619
the best

1905
05:26:47,619 --> 05:26:55,790
Without a question without any single question at all. The only problem with crave beef jerky is it is incredibly expensive

1906
05:26:56,830 --> 05:27:00,459
But it is it is the best

1907
05:27:01,340 --> 05:27:03,340
It's the best

1908
05:27:03,580 --> 05:27:08,540
I have had lots of beef jerky before i've never had one that was better than crave

1909
05:27:10,689 --> 05:27:12,689
It's just very expensive

1910
05:27:12,849 --> 05:27:18,799
It's like eight bucks. Yes

1911
05:27:19,360 --> 05:27:24,799
It is like 750 or eight bucks for one of those bags of beef jerky. It's only like one or two and a half

1912
05:27:24,880 --> 05:27:26,880
It's like I can eat the whole thing in one bag

1913
05:27:27,919 --> 05:27:33,939
And that's the problem when you go get it

1914
05:27:35,299 --> 05:27:36,500
Oh

1915
05:27:36,500 --> 05:27:40,099
Crave beef jerky. All right. I love this stuff

1916
05:27:40,659 --> 05:27:43,220
You know how many i'm gonna grab like four of them. Yeah

1917
05:27:43,220 --> 05:27:46,419
I want to I want to make sure I have some in case i'm hungry and get one of those snacks

1918
05:27:47,380 --> 05:27:54,139
Then you go to the checkout and you realize that you just bought like 40 fucking dollars of your grocery bill is beef jerky

1919
05:27:55,180 --> 05:27:59,459
And you're like what what why why is my grocery bill so high?

1920
05:28:01,810 --> 05:28:04,130
40 but 50 dollars, but that

1921
05:28:04,689 --> 05:28:07,810
All right, because like well, I got like five or six like crazy

1922
05:28:08,450 --> 05:28:11,650
That's a huge amount of money for my grocery bill. Okay

1923
05:28:14,750 --> 05:28:16,509
fine dining

1924
05:28:16,509 --> 05:28:24,270
Like I said one thing if it was expensive and not the best

1925
05:28:25,459 --> 05:28:27,950
But it's expensive

1926
05:28:28,029 --> 05:28:29,389
and the best

1927
05:28:29,389 --> 05:28:33,680
One of my favorites is is uh chili lime

1928
05:28:34,720 --> 05:28:35,599
Oh

1929
05:28:35,599 --> 05:28:42,540
Doesn't get better than that. There's a sweet chipotle. Mm. It's okay. It's not as good as the chili lime though. Seriously

1930
05:28:47,439 --> 05:28:50,799
Jeremy's part of the one percent one percent jerky

1931
05:28:52,770 --> 05:28:55,169
Jack links original well, hold on jack links

1932
05:28:56,509 --> 05:28:57,889
Original

1933
05:28:57,889 --> 05:29:07,599
Versus crave original. Let's get it. What's the best beef jerky for you?

1934
05:29:08,240 --> 05:29:10,240
Like what's the highest quality? Let's see

1935
05:29:12,529 --> 05:29:14,619
uh

1936
05:29:14,619 --> 05:29:16,619
Jack links if you want a classic standard

1937
05:29:17,340 --> 05:29:22,000
classic standard

1938
05:29:22,000 --> 05:29:24,799
Try crave if you like super niche flavors

1939
05:29:28,610 --> 05:29:36,450
Black cherry barbecue pork jerky lemon garlic turkey jerky garlic chili pepper beef jerky. Ooh, that sounds pretty good to me

1940
05:29:37,330 --> 05:29:39,569
It's because it's weird. No, it's not. It's great

1941
05:29:40,849 --> 05:29:46,220
Hold on. What's the best and worst beef jerky ranked? What's the worst?

1942
05:29:47,020 --> 05:29:50,299
Three jerks jerky filet mignon beef jerky apparently is the worst

1943
05:29:51,340 --> 05:29:53,860
Jerky ever

1944
05:29:53,860 --> 05:29:56,259
And then chefs cut real steak jerky

1945
05:29:57,060 --> 05:30:00,319
apparently second worst

1946
05:30:00,619 --> 05:30:03,279
Oberto original beef jerky is like

1947
05:30:05,340 --> 05:30:07,340
Jack links coming in at number three

1948
05:30:08,290 --> 05:30:11,650
Jack links original beef jerky number three. Oh fuck off

1949
05:30:12,450 --> 05:30:15,569
Crave original sea salt at number two. What's number one?

1950
05:30:16,529 --> 05:30:21,490
Oh, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, whoa, wait a minute. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. This is the worst. This is the worst

1951
05:30:21,490 --> 05:30:23,970
This is top worst. This is number two worst

1952
05:30:24,529 --> 05:30:28,049
What's the worst beef jerky? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

1953
05:30:29,169 --> 05:30:30,770
This is the worst

1954
05:30:30,770 --> 05:30:35,310
What's wrong with what do they say about it?

1955
05:30:44,590 --> 05:30:49,630
Yes craves jerky is made with an impressive list of all-natural minimally processed ingredients

1956
05:30:50,270 --> 05:30:55,950
But this tiny one ounce serving has 10 grams of sugar in it a third of every gram of jerky is sugar

1957
05:30:56,349 --> 05:31:00,430
For comparison a fifth of each gram of glazed crispy cream donut is sugar

1958
05:31:03,220 --> 05:31:04,819
Who gives a shit?

1959
05:31:04,819 --> 05:31:14,180
Although this is now the best. All right, let's hold on

1960
05:31:15,220 --> 05:31:17,939
This is i'm actually getting mad right now. What's number one?

1965
05:31:47,419 --> 05:31:54,770
Oh, it's a donut. It's not the donut. Yeah, and when you eat white bread your body treats it like cotton candy

1966
05:31:55,330 --> 05:31:57,169
Whoop the fucking doom

1967
05:31:57,169 --> 05:32:00,000
We really have to debate that

1968
05:32:00,000 --> 05:32:13,279

Hmm, I could go up higher on the tree and these these ones are kind of rotten

1982
05:33:18,770 --> 05:33:21,169
But I could go higher up and get actually good apples

1983
05:33:21,889 --> 05:33:30,060
No

1984
05:33:31,819 --> 05:33:34,529

2005
05:35:09,580 --> 05:35:11,580
You're most really scary

2006
05:35:12,220 --> 05:35:16,930

I want to listen to this. I don't even know what this is. This is not even the same stream

This is tomato stream streamers. I try to avoid it

2010
05:35:35,729 --> 05:35:39,409
Yes, god, you guys are mean. Does he tell you guys it mean because like

2011
05:35:39,970 --> 05:35:44,849
It seems like everyone's in on some joke about bullying him for his height. That's pretty toxic. What the fuck

2012
05:35:45,810 --> 05:35:47,250
Hey

2013
05:35:47,250 --> 05:35:53,790
You guys bully me for my color blindness, I guess which isn't actually even color blindness. It's gaslighting. So I guess

2014
05:35:56,590 --> 05:36:01,599
Have you not met him in person i've met him multiple times in person every single time i've met him

2015
05:36:01,840 --> 05:36:03,840
He hasn't been that short. Oh

2016
05:36:03,919 --> 05:36:05,919
He's been moderately tall

2017
05:36:06,319 --> 05:36:10,639
At average not at best. He was just he was he was like

2018
05:36:11,759 --> 05:36:18,259
He wasn't short to me didn't seem that short. Then again, he was on like he was wearing like very high heel shoes

2019
05:36:26,060 --> 05:36:28,060
At the time that I met him

2020
05:36:38,909 --> 05:36:41,619

Talking about talking about the wind being taken out of your sails

05:36:54,340 --> 05:37:00,880
From what's like having a direct line to hundreds of nine-year-olds every night

2024
05:37:09,540 --> 05:37:11,540
Stop

2025
05:37:12,819 --> 05:37:16,020
I need to finish the bits we gotta get out of here

2026
05:37:22,240 --> 05:37:26,560
No, what what set it off completely tonight was somebody came in and said

2027
05:37:28,560 --> 05:37:30,619
What was it? It was like

2028
05:37:30,619 --> 05:37:35,099
Like lol i'm 15 and taller than jeremy and it's like dude

2029
05:37:35,900 --> 05:37:38,860

I didn't

2033
05:37:52,000 --> 05:37:56,799
I didn't like eat sand for breakfast and lunch and dinner every day. I just happened to not be

2034
05:37:57,840 --> 05:37:59,840
That's like our dna, man

2035
05:38:01,630 --> 05:38:03,630
It's like not so surprising

2036
05:38:07,900 --> 05:38:12,849
Oh, man boxbox coming in with a braid boxbox said you would feed us

2037
05:38:13,810 --> 05:38:17,330

2039
05:38:29,520 --> 05:38:32,340
What do you guys want corn?

2040
05:38:32,340 --> 05:38:34,860
Got lots of sand

2041
05:38:34,860 --> 05:38:36,860
I got sand i've got corn i've got lettuce

2042
05:38:37,340 --> 05:38:39,900
Apparently the only three things that i've ever eaten in my life

2043
05:38:40,619 --> 05:38:42,779
To make me smaller than a 15 year old

2044
05:38:45,549 --> 05:38:49,709
If only he had eaten his vitamins and had broccoli maybe he would

2045
05:38:50,430 --> 05:38:52,669
You know what i'm not even going to get into it anymore

2046
05:38:53,900 --> 05:38:55,900
No, i've said my piece

2047
05:38:57,860 --> 05:39:02,819
Sand isn't food, but hey welcome 1700 people almost 2 000 people in a raid. Thank you boxbox

2048
05:39:03,540 --> 05:39:05,220

2051
05:39:11,340 --> 05:39:12,860
and how

05:39:12,860 --> 05:39:17,020
people are comedians

2053
05:39:17,020 --> 05:39:20,060
It's interesting that there's thousands of comedians here

2054
05:39:22,000 --> 05:39:25,919
And they must all be part of the same comedy group because they all say the same jokes

2055
05:39:26,720 --> 05:39:30,400
They're all together in the I guess in the same same room, I guess

2056
05:39:31,200 --> 05:39:34,590
It's not much of a debate

2057
05:39:38,369 --> 05:39:42,049
We're all funny act. There it is. There it is. There it is. There it is. There it is. There it is

2058
05:39:42,369 --> 05:39:54,979

05:39:55,299 --> 05:39:57,299
By the way again boxbox. Thank you

2060
05:39:57,619 --> 05:39:59,619
Hope you had a good stream. Hope you guys are having a great night

2061
05:40:01,680 --> 05:40:03,299
if um

2062
05:40:03,299 --> 05:40:06,180
If tomorrow i'll be streaming rhythm heaven for the week

2063
05:40:06,819 --> 05:40:10,290
As we wind down for the end of tonight's stream

2064
05:40:11,090 --> 05:40:17,419
But yeah, uh, we're currently going over the bits

2065
05:40:18,380 --> 05:40:19,819
I do the

2066
05:40:19,819 --> 05:40:24,380
I don't read subs or bits or any donations on stream. We do it at the end of the post stream

2067
05:40:24,459 --> 05:40:26,299
Which is what we're doing now

2068
05:40:26,299 --> 05:40:29,580
and we have a very very very long stream a few days ago that I

2069
05:40:31,020 --> 05:40:33,459
Um almost collapsed

2070
05:40:33,939 --> 05:40:38,180
And I couldn't stand anymore as I had to leave and it was a 13 and a half hour stream and I was like

2071
05:40:38,259 --> 05:40:40,259
I gotta get out of here. So we're doing them now

2072
05:40:40,740 --> 05:40:42,500
I could have just said that

2073
05:40:42,500 --> 05:40:44,500
Much easier in about one sentence

2074
05:40:44,819 --> 05:40:52,259
All right, like that was much easier just to say hey i'm doing the bits from three days ago. Okay

2075
05:40:53,389 --> 05:40:57,310
All right, uh half monty. Thanks for the five dollars and ten cents. Great job jerma

2076
05:40:57,310 --> 05:41:00,029

Cad btv. Thanks for the 250

2084
05:41:28,080 --> 05:41:31,520
I believe you can do this. I'm sorry. You think my support is fake grass

2085
05:41:32,080 --> 05:41:34,159
But I still believe you can beat this game little buddy

2086
05:41:36,319 --> 05:41:42,459
Pugles thanks for 250 legolas is a prince. He's only here to look good. He's good with him. He's got the good bow

2087
05:41:42,540 --> 05:41:44,979
He's good with bow

2088
05:41:44,979 --> 05:41:47,060
Saren fp. Thanks for the 500 bits yo jerma

2089
05:41:47,060 --> 05:41:50,180
I can't believe i've stuck around for almost 11 hours and loved every bit of it

2090
05:41:50,180 --> 05:41:52,180
There was still over two and a half hours after that

2091
05:41:52,340 --> 05:41:56,110
I'll probably be asleep by the time you read this but I just wanted to let you know not to

2092
05:41:56,750 --> 05:42:01,020
Not to something

2093
05:42:01,020 --> 05:42:03,340
a turbo driver dev gave

2094
05:42:04,360 --> 05:42:05,580
5,000

2095
05:42:05,580 --> 05:42:06,860
bits

2096
05:42:06,860 --> 05:42:11,220
Turbo driver dev. Thank you

2097
05:42:11,220 --> 05:42:15,389
I wake up in europe and you're still streaming. You're truly insane

2098
05:42:16,430 --> 05:42:18,430
Thank you turbo driver for the huge amount of money

2099
05:42:19,229 --> 05:42:23,419
Sometimes that happens. It only happens when I play playstation 2 or dreamcast games

2100
05:42:25,020 --> 05:42:25,819
and

2101
05:42:25,819 --> 05:42:28,380
That's actually kind of bad

2102
05:42:28,860 --> 05:42:31,569
because a shitload of things I have back here are

2103
05:42:32,529 --> 05:42:34,770
playstation 2

2104
05:42:35,229 --> 05:42:37,229
games old games, so

2105
05:42:38,270 --> 05:42:40,270
I don't know if it's about the old games thing

2106
05:42:40,990 --> 05:42:43,740
But I got a lot of them behind me

2107
05:42:43,900 --> 05:42:47,169
So be careful

2108
05:42:47,169 --> 05:42:52,990
Be careful nile aureon says for 300 bits. Hey, you fucking died mate. He he xd

2109
05:42:53,630 --> 05:42:54,909
Thank you

2110
05:42:54,909 --> 05:42:58,909
Judge mortis a thousand bits jerma, please for the love of god turn it off and go to bed your mother

2111
05:42:58,909 --> 05:43:01,950
And I can hear your damn tears through the wall go to sleep

2112
05:43:02,029 --> 05:43:04,139

Nile aureon again 300 bits jerma has ascended

2116
05:43:18,220 --> 05:43:20,220
fox club 49 or 500 bits

2117
05:43:21,020 --> 05:43:26,700
Jerma, I went to bed for six or seven hours had a dream you accidentally put porn on the stream during a break

2118
05:43:27,020 --> 05:43:29,740
Woke up sweating for some reason and then saw you were still streaming

2119
05:43:30,380 --> 05:43:35,099
I don't know what's with the sex dreams people have of me putting sex on my stream

2120
05:43:36,060 --> 05:43:45,740
There has to be some reason why this is happening more than if okay if more than one person is having

2121
05:43:46,840 --> 05:43:48,840
subconscious dreams

2122
05:43:49,180 --> 05:43:51,180
Of me having sex on stream

2123
05:43:51,979 --> 05:43:53,979
Or doing porn on stream

2124
05:43:55,020 --> 05:43:57,020
What kind of vibe am I giving off?

2125
05:43:59,250 --> 05:44:01,569
That has to what kind of vibe am I giving off?

2126
05:44:13,950 --> 05:44:16,270
It's because people fall asleep in front of your streams and then

2127
05:44:18,770 --> 05:44:20,610
All right, let's get to the end here

2128
05:44:20,610 --> 05:44:23,810
Uh bug bear and frog. Thanks for the 500 bits. They say congrats

2129
05:44:24,369 --> 05:44:28,130
250 from cad. I hear vego beat helms deep his first try on expert

2130
05:44:29,009 --> 05:44:31,090
Nope

2131
05:44:31,090 --> 05:44:36,130
And then finally from a few nights ago. We had fifty dollars five thousand bits from swivel

2132
05:44:37,169 --> 05:44:39,169
Thanks for the 5k bits

2133
05:44:40,130 --> 05:44:45,250
Thanks for the longest stream jerma. Love you, man. What's the software that you edit your voice with?

2134
05:44:51,520 --> 05:44:53,599
software

2135
05:44:53,599 --> 05:44:58,209
Is it's not software at all. It's hardware. Is it go xlr?

2136
05:44:59,229 --> 05:45:02,319
I just got it

2137
05:45:02,319 --> 05:45:04,799
It's pretty fun. You can do all kinds of cool stuff with it

2138
05:45:07,040 --> 05:45:09,040
You can do all kind of kylo ren

2139
05:45:09,200 --> 05:45:11,200
What do you mean? Hold on kylo ren

2140
05:45:12,770 --> 05:45:14,770
kylo ren

2141
05:45:14,770 --> 05:45:16,770
Wait, wait

2142
05:45:21,119 --> 05:45:22,400
Kylo ren

2143
05:45:22,400 --> 05:45:38,939
Do you feel it? I know you did it's in a bb unit. It's in a bb unit. It's in a bb unit

2144
05:45:41,069 --> 05:45:45,650
Uh, we define those droids find where he is

2145
05:45:46,209 --> 05:45:48,209
And then get that

2146
05:45:48,450 --> 05:45:51,650
I can't say anything that might possibly be

2147
05:45:52,369 --> 05:45:54,900
a character's name

2148
05:45:54,900 --> 05:45:56,900
Or anybody that's in the story at all

2149
05:45:58,060 --> 05:46:01,419
Because that could be a somebody will say a spoiler in chat and then they'll get banned

2150
05:46:03,169 --> 05:46:04,930
So tell me ray

2151
05:46:04,930 --> 05:46:08,130
Fuck, I just said your name. Therefore. I just ruined everything

2152
05:46:09,090 --> 05:46:10,529
So tell me

2153
05:46:10,529 --> 05:46:11,650
where

2154
05:46:11,650 --> 05:46:12,610
is

2155
05:46:12,610 --> 05:46:14,610
that droid

2156
05:46:14,689 --> 05:46:32,209
It's in a bb unit

2157
05:46:43,009 --> 05:46:45,310
Why is the bb unit funny

2158
05:46:46,619 --> 05:46:48,459
I don't know is it

2159
05:46:48,459 --> 05:46:50,700
I'm out. I don't particularly think so

2160
05:46:51,099 --> 05:46:53,099
You will beatbox as kylo ren

2161
05:46:53,819 --> 05:47:01,380
Where is it?

2162
05:47:01,380 --> 05:47:06,509
Oh, I know. I know you know. See the thing is

2163
05:47:08,000 --> 05:47:10,540
I see it

2164
05:47:10,540 --> 05:47:12,540
I've always seen it. I've always

2165
05:47:24,209 --> 05:47:25,810
Only one beatbox

2166
05:47:25,810 --> 05:47:28,849
He can only do well now i've turned into bugleberry. Oh, oh

2167

You can tell when it's bugleberry ready. Oh, oh and my hands come up. Oh, and he doesn't jim carrey. Oh, I oh

2168
05:47:41,970 --> 05:47:43,970
Bugleberry just is kylo ren

2169
05:47:49,840 --> 05:47:53,599
Minus 3 000 viewers because you said the name bugleberry

2170
05:47:57,759 --> 05:47:59,759
He's lost his fucking mind

2171
05:48:00,659 --> 05:48:06,659
Viewers dropping. Oh, no. Oh, whatever. Well, I do the fact that view hold on. It's gonna be a little bit more ridiculous

2172
05:48:07,459 --> 05:48:09,459
And you know the thing is

2173
05:48:09,700 --> 05:48:11,700
All you have to do

2174
05:48:11,700 --> 05:48:16,580
Is let's do an experiment. Let's do an experiment if I title the stream bugleberry reads bits

2175
05:48:17,380 --> 05:48:19,380
Willed a thousand people leave

2176
05:48:19,700 --> 05:48:28,020
Do you think so? I actually don't want to do that experiment

2177
05:48:28,819 --> 05:48:33,040
What the fuck were we doing?

2178
05:48:33,520 --> 05:48:37,099
Oh, right kylo ren. I hold on. What does this one do?

2179
05:49:47,439 --> 05:49:49,439
Combine voice

2180
05:49:49,759 --> 05:49:54,020
What is he doing? I don't I I don't know

2181
05:49:55,139 --> 05:49:57,380
Apparently kylo ren's in school of the school

2182
05:49:58,340 --> 05:50:00,340
Somebody threw food at him or something

2183
05:50:00,979 --> 05:50:10,349
I got lost there. I'm sure you all did too. All right, let's go to the uh current bits

05:51:26,029 --> 05:51:29,569
Are we supposed to be short? I saw this already

2200
05:51:31,009 --> 05:51:33,569
It was oh, oh very funny

2201
05:51:36,619 --> 05:51:37,900
Hey toy

2202
05:51:37,900 --> 05:51:42,220
Croak, thanks for the 500 bits. I've had a long history of word surgery due to my needlessly broken bladder

2203
05:51:42,779 --> 05:51:44,779
Which just recently started to heal

2204
05:51:44,860 --> 05:51:48,459
Hope whatever it is you're going through finds an end soon and you find relief soon enough me too

2205
05:51:50,259 --> 05:51:52,259
it's starting to be just

2206
05:51:52,419 --> 05:51:54,580
something that I always constantly have to think about

2207
05:51:56,259 --> 05:51:58,060
and

2208
05:51:58,060 --> 05:52:00,860
It's it's just annoying right it nobody wants to ever have

2209
05:52:01,819 --> 05:52:05,900
A medical issue or a problem that you don't know. What is the actual problem?

2210
05:52:06,939 --> 05:52:10,299
But I have i'm going down the road of knowing what it is

2211
05:52:11,099 --> 05:52:17,919
And trying to obviously I have to figure out what kind of treatment or solution I want to do

2212
05:52:17,919 --> 05:52:19,919
Do I want to have surgery on my hernia?

2213
05:52:20,159 --> 05:52:22,159
Do I want to just get that out of the way and just do it?

2214
05:52:22,560 --> 05:52:27,919
Because I have one and it might be contributing to some of these problems. Do I want to get an injection in my rib cage?

2215
05:52:29,119 --> 05:52:31,119
To do a nerve

2216
05:52:31,119 --> 05:52:35,040
Stop some of the nerve problems right from the whatever the inflammation in my rib cage

2217
05:52:35,439 --> 05:52:37,119
Do I want to do those things?

2218
05:52:37,119 --> 05:52:39,360
And when am I going to do those things? How am I going to do those things?

2219
05:52:40,319 --> 05:52:45,250
Uh, what am I gonna just schedule out like now do it now?

2220
05:52:46,369 --> 05:52:52,029
I don't know because I was told that the hernia that I have

2221
05:52:53,139 --> 05:52:55,139
Is not really big enough

2222
05:52:55,540 --> 05:52:58,659
to need to do surgery on it yet

2223
05:52:59,619 --> 05:53:01,900
it's kind of at the

2224
05:53:01,900 --> 05:53:04,060
Wait and see because it's not that it's not huge

2225
05:53:04,619 --> 05:53:12,400
It's compact. Yes

2226
05:53:12,400 --> 05:53:13,680

05:53:13,680 --> 05:53:18,529
What do you mean yet? Um hernias at the hernias can get worse

2228
05:53:19,490 --> 05:53:24,479
This could be something that's been developing in my stomach and esophagus for years

2229
05:53:25,439 --> 05:53:28,880
And it could just get worse. You throwing up softball jokes, you know

05:53:32,509 --> 05:53:35,470
You set it up. We knock it's please explain this in the trump voice

2231
05:53:43,169 --> 05:53:46,930
Oh, we are all here in this beautiful. Wait, that's not correct

2232
05:53:47,650 --> 05:53:52,259
Uh, let me excuse me

2233
05:53:52,500 --> 05:53:56,360

It's not it. It's it's not a big deal

2239
05:54:19,220 --> 05:54:21,220
I just have a small hernia

2240
05:54:21,619 --> 05:54:27,619
If the hernia is big enough to be a problem, but it's not really a problem. It's it's it's a little large

2241
05:54:28,180 --> 05:54:29,540
It's not really

2242
05:54:29,540 --> 05:54:34,069
It's it always goes back to bugleberry

2243
05:54:37,729 --> 05:54:39,729

05:57:35,840 --> 05:57:40,080

05:57:52,880 --> 05:57:54,880
I implore you I implore you

2289
05:57:56,080 --> 05:57:58,180
if you have

2290
05:57:58,180 --> 05:58:00,180
Any negative thoughts like that?

2291
05:58:00,580 --> 05:58:02,860
Or anything to do with

2292
05:58:02,860 --> 05:58:04,860
hurting yourself or

2293
05:58:04,860 --> 05:58:08,700
Self-harm or any of those kind of thoughts you don't want to be having those thoughts in the first place

2294
05:58:09,500 --> 05:58:16,529
I would get in touch with somebody that's a professional that can help you

2295
05:58:17,939 --> 05:58:19,939
Because you never want to let that linger

2296
05:58:22,220 --> 05:58:26,619
And even if you say that it does, you know watching these streams helps and laughing here

2297
05:58:27,259 --> 05:58:28,299
uh

2298
05:58:28,299 --> 05:58:30,299
Helps you and keeps you from acting on anything

2299
05:58:33,470 --> 05:58:35,310
You got to be careful there

2300
05:58:35,310 --> 05:58:42,540
Please please please

2301
05:58:43,650 --> 05:58:45,650
Go at it from a few different avenues

2302
05:58:46,049 --> 05:58:57,840
If I can elevate your mood a little bit

2303
05:58:59,139 --> 05:59:01,139
That makes me really really happy

2304
05:59:06,430 --> 05:59:08,430
just make sure that you're

2305
05:59:08,830 --> 05:59:10,830
Taking the steps necessary to try to

2306
05:59:11,549 --> 05:59:12,909
Get better

2307
05:59:12,909 --> 05:59:18,540
And sometimes it takes more than one front to do that

2308
05:59:19,419 --> 05:59:25,970
I wish you the best of luck. Thank you so much for the 700 bits

2309
05:59:27,009 --> 05:59:42,779
And thanks for hanging out. Keep on keeping on no shame and getting help

2310
05:59:43,900 --> 05:59:48,540
That's true

2311
05:59:48,540 --> 05:59:50,299
Honestly, we should we should

2312
05:59:50,299 --> 05:59:52,299
We should think about

2313
05:59:52,380 --> 05:59:54,700
mental health the same way we think about

2314
05:59:55,900 --> 05:59:59,759
If you got hurt, you know, if you like you're handed physical

2315
06:00:00,720 --> 06:00:05,740
You know what i'm saying?

2316
06:00:05,740 --> 06:00:12,849
Medical we should not be thinking about mental health as oh, no, no, no, no, that's that's like that's completely different

2317
06:00:12,849 --> 06:00:16,209
It's different. No, that's way different. It's I don't know. No, no, we don't talk about that

2318
06:00:17,919 --> 06:00:20,479
Because it's your it's your body everybody. It's everybody has a

2319
06:00:22,000 --> 06:00:26,029
It's your brain. It's your body. We got to treat it the same way

2320
06:00:26,990 --> 06:00:29,619
It has to be taken as seriously

2321
06:00:37,520 --> 06:00:39,520
Everyone has a brain. Yeah, no, that's true

2322
06:00:44,419 --> 06:00:46,419
It's different but it's just as important

2323
06:00:46,819 --> 06:00:48,580
Yeah, it is

2324
06:00:48,580 --> 06:00:52,290
but if you go to

2325
06:00:53,090 --> 06:00:54,659
uh

2326
06:00:54,659 --> 06:00:56,500
colon doctor

2327
06:00:56,500 --> 06:00:59,380
and you go to a

2328
06:01:00,340 --> 06:01:01,939
bone doctor

2329
06:01:01,939 --> 06:01:03,779
Those are completely different

2330
06:01:03,779 --> 06:01:06,240
They're completely they're treated completely differently

2331
06:01:07,759 --> 06:01:11,279
The tests that are completely different the way that you treat it is completely different, but it's still

2332
06:01:12,990 --> 06:01:24,930
Still medicine it's still treatment and for for some there's this

2333
06:01:27,220 --> 06:01:29,139
There's this stigma

2334
06:01:29,139 --> 06:01:35,779
That I really hope that we get over when it comes to how we see mental health and how we view mental health

2335
06:01:38,419 --> 06:01:40,020
It really shouldn't be there

2336
06:01:40,020 --> 06:01:41,939
It just should not be there

2337
06:01:41,939 --> 06:01:47,860
We need to treat

2338
06:01:47,860 --> 06:01:49,860
The issues that come up

2339
06:01:49,860 --> 06:01:52,000
in our bodies

2340
06:01:52,000 --> 06:01:54,720
And that's really the end of it all that's really what it should be

2341
06:01:55,680 --> 06:02:02,209
That's kind of how I feel about that

2342
06:02:02,450 --> 06:02:06,930
The bone doctor will heal

2343
06:02:07,650 --> 06:02:10,580
Almost said the rest of that

2344
06:02:10,580 --> 06:02:12,580
Almost said the rest of that

2345
06:02:17,020 --> 06:02:21,500
But anyways one day we will all be robots and all we have to worry about is rust

2346
06:02:30,380 --> 06:02:32,459
S. J. Thanks for the 250 hey germo

2347
06:02:33,180 --> 06:02:36,130
I've been a fan for a long time and want to share a dream that I had

2348
06:02:36,930 --> 06:02:38,450
Here we go

2349
06:02:38,450 --> 06:02:41,650
Where you were hosting a tour across the u.s with chat on your bus

2350
06:02:42,610 --> 06:02:47,650
Halfway in a boring state people convinced you to take a test made by chat

2351
06:02:48,369 --> 06:02:52,529
you sat down in some first grade classroom and answered questions like

2352
06:02:53,250 --> 06:02:56,450
Do you think you contribute to society?

2353
06:02:57,810 --> 06:03:01,009
One was what is your response to baby?

2354
06:03:01,889 --> 06:03:03,889
The answers you could choose were

2355
06:03:04,209 --> 06:03:09,060
Uh, yeah, or no, no, no you screeched for two minutes

2356
06:03:09,700 --> 06:03:11,299
And punched a guy

2357
06:03:11,299 --> 06:03:18,459
What are you guys eating when you watch these streams?

2358
06:03:19,340 --> 06:03:23,020
Do you all right? Do you do you guys just eat macaroni and cheese before you go to bed?

2359
06:03:23,900 --> 06:03:28,459
What are you eating before a stream before you go to bed?

2360
06:03:35,919 --> 06:03:39,380
corn and sand

2361
06:03:39,380 --> 06:03:43,299
Germa is just a scary mother fucker. No, but I am I though?

2362
06:03:46,240 --> 06:03:48,240
I completely disagree

2363
06:03:50,240 --> 06:04:07,729
I disagree it doesn't make any sense to me. No, they're gonna have bad dreams

2364
06:04:08,689 --> 06:04:15,740
Have been they're gonna be i'm gonna get a message tomorrow

2365
06:04:15,979 --> 06:04:18,619
Hey, dude, uh, I ate like a bowl of mac and cheese

2366
06:04:19,099 --> 06:04:23,580
And went to sleep and then I had a dream that you went through the computer and you were a monster and you killed me

2367
06:04:24,540 --> 06:04:30,450
I don't understand why they're having these dreams. This must be it must be something they're learning in school

2368
06:04:31,409 --> 06:04:42,209
Except you probably woke up somebody. I know i'm so fucking stupid

2369
06:04:43,169 --> 06:04:48,930
I just forget that I forget it's not like five people in a room. It's like thousands of people here

2370
06:04:49,409 --> 06:04:54,610
I forget i'm not I really do I really do forget that it's not like 10 people hanging out in my room

2371
06:04:59,970 --> 06:05:03,409
It's 2 a.m. Eastern. Ah shit. Well, good morning

2372
06:05:04,450 --> 06:05:07,970
I don't know what that was but it wasn't me

2373
06:05:08,849 --> 06:05:14,689
Cat attack. Thanks for the 500 bits. Hey germa. Hope everything's going well with the medical stuff

2374
06:05:14,689 --> 06:05:16,689

06:05:16,689 --> 06:05:20,689
So I know every day is a new battle it seems don't push yourself too hard for our sake

2391
06:06:27,169 --> 06:06:28,939
putting teeth

2392
06:06:28,939 --> 06:06:30,939
That aren't your teeth

2393
06:06:31,099 --> 06:06:33,099
on an image of you

2394
06:06:33,630 --> 06:06:46,590
Is terrifying like when you put teeth on something these are not my teeth

2395
06:06:47,889 --> 06:06:49,090
and it's

2396
06:06:49,090 --> 06:06:50,369
scary

2397
06:06:50,369 --> 06:06:53,740
Because this is kind of what I I mean if if I did that

2398
06:06:54,459 --> 06:06:56,459
You know, it would look like this

2399
06:06:56,459 --> 06:07:00,750
But this bottom half just is all wrong. It's just not my teeth

2400
06:07:01,709 --> 06:07:05,939

2551
06:18:41,819 --> 06:18:50,849
Oh, there's gonna be some problems this week for jereby. You're gonna know things that I don't

2552
06:18:51,409 --> 06:19:01,540
Someone's gonna get all this info and they're gonna do a full chart and a full

2553
06:19:02,500 --> 06:19:06,099
The week coming up and they're gonna give a bit message saying hey, dude, um

2554
06:19:06,900 --> 06:19:08,340
Don't play pool

2555
06:19:08,340 --> 06:19:11,069
for the next week

2556
06:19:11,069 --> 06:19:18,000
Something bad will happen. I'm just like what the fuck dude. I just want to tell you

2557
06:19:18,639 --> 06:19:22,939
Don't eat anything green for the next three days. Oh, okay

2558
06:19:25,459 --> 06:19:27,459
I guess I guess I

2559
06:19:28,020 --> 06:19:30,020
Charts the charts said it

2560
06:19:30,500 --> 06:19:35,979
You don't anyways. I have plenty of greens. I love fucking avocados. I love I love shredded

2561
06:19:36,599 --> 06:19:38,849
iceberg lettuce

2562
06:19:38,849 --> 06:19:40,849
I love shredded iceberg lettuce

2563
06:19:41,250 --> 06:19:51,950
Which is 85 percent water and then weird gross fibers and it doesn't do anything. I also like cabbage

2564
06:19:52,110 --> 06:19:53,869
No, I don't that's a lie

2565
06:19:53,869 --> 06:19:56,720
I like um

2566
06:19:56,720 --> 06:19:58,720
Spinach I do love spinach

2567
06:20:03,389 --> 06:20:06,139
Shred shredded lettuce

2568
06:20:07,060 --> 06:20:09,060
mayonnaise and chicken sandwich

2569
06:20:09,619 --> 06:20:18,529
Yeah, I think so. I think so somebody said gross

2570
06:20:19,490 --> 06:20:26,689
Don't make me angry

2571
06:20:26,689 --> 06:20:31,409
You would love me when i'm angry because the jump king string is one of the top streams i've ever done

2572
06:20:32,369 --> 06:20:35,299
So go ahead get angry

2573
06:20:35,299 --> 06:20:41,360
I had the highest retention rate per viewer on that stream

2574
06:20:42,080 --> 06:20:44,080
Than anything i've ever done before

2575
06:20:47,580 --> 06:20:50,639
Also made that one up too. Hey, mr. Dask

2576
06:20:51,580 --> 06:20:53,419
Thanks for the thousand bits

2577
06:20:53,419 --> 06:20:57,650
Is this enough to cover the guild charter?

2578
06:20:58,450 --> 06:21:01,759
I thought I already paid for it

2579
06:21:01,759 --> 06:21:06,880
But you kept asking again and again to cough it up or else I couldn't sell my strongest potions around here

2580
06:21:07,439 --> 06:21:12,959
Hope this isn't because of my refusal to sell them to you. My strongest potions would kill a dragon let alone a man

2581
06:21:14,259 --> 06:21:16,259
Well, that's i'm sorry to hear that

2582
06:21:17,060 --> 06:21:19,779
Uh, I did not i have nothing to do with this. Thanks for the thousand bits

2583
06:21:20,819 --> 06:21:25,139
Peaceful hailey. Thanks for the 250 peaceful hailey. Hey jeremy. Hope you auto and kimmer well

2584
06:21:25,540 --> 06:21:28,099
Hope auto surgery went well in your mri. I'm sure it did

2585
06:21:28,979 --> 06:21:30,979
I usually have more to say but I got nothing

2586
06:21:31,060 --> 06:21:33,060
Just hope you have there's no music

2587
06:21:33,220 --> 06:21:35,220
Just hope you have a good night

2588
06:21:36,849 --> 06:21:43,060
Thank you. Peaceful hailey. I know what the video is

2589
06:21:45,869 --> 06:21:47,389
if you have

2590
06:21:47,389 --> 06:21:51,220
a youtube account

2591
06:21:51,220 --> 06:21:53,659
That was created

2592
06:21:53,659 --> 06:21:55,659
over the last 10 years

2593
06:21:56,060 --> 06:21:58,060
You've seen the video

2594
06:21:58,139 --> 06:22:04,029
Does that video have?

2595
06:22:04,029 --> 06:22:06,349
How many views does that video have like 600 billion?

2596
06:22:07,310 --> 06:22:14,990
Six million. Oh

2597
06:22:15,709 --> 06:22:21,860
That was wrong. Okay. All right. We're almost done here. We have uh niece

2598
06:22:21,860 --> 06:22:22,979
Thanks for the 500 bits

2599
06:22:22,979 --> 06:22:28,659
I want you to use my money to take kim on a romantic date to mcdonald's and only order from the dollar menu

2600
06:22:29,700 --> 06:22:36,659
Yeah, do you want to go to mcdonald's?

2601
06:22:36,659 --> 06:22:47,020
Like actually right when this is over you want to go mcdonald's? It's five. That's five bucks

2602
06:22:47,580 --> 06:22:52,799
You know, you can't you can't scoff at five bucks man five. It's five bucks

2603
06:22:54,819 --> 06:22:58,900
I love mcdonald's

2604
06:22:58,900 --> 06:23:00,900
I i'd love I do

2605
06:23:01,060 --> 06:23:13,470
I would rather eat at mcdonald's than most places because they got the big mac and nobody else has the big mac

2606
06:23:14,189 --> 06:23:17,150
The big mac is the best. It's just I love that thing

2607
06:23:17,950 --> 06:23:21,779
I get the same order every time I go to mcdonald's

2608
06:23:22,479 --> 06:23:24,479
And you're gonna think i'm disgusting

2609
06:23:24,880 --> 06:23:26,400
but if i'm hungry

2610
06:23:26,400 --> 06:23:28,080
I want to just

2611
06:23:28,080 --> 06:23:30,959
eat, you know what i'm saying e a t

2612
06:23:31,919 --> 06:23:35,020
Go to mcdonald's and we gotta change the screen

2613
06:23:35,340 --> 06:23:36,380
Yeah, this is

2614
06:23:36,380 --> 06:23:40,459
Go to mcdonald's to get a number one

2615
06:23:40,459 --> 06:23:44,380
And I don't really drink that much. I try not to drink a whole lot of soda. I get a bottle of water

2616
06:23:45,340 --> 06:23:48,900
I get a bottle of water number one with a good big fry

2617
06:23:53,950 --> 06:23:55,810
That's one

2618
06:23:55,810 --> 06:23:57,779
I then

2619
06:23:57,779 --> 06:24:00,720
get

2620
06:24:00,720 --> 06:24:05,380
I'm i'm this i'm naked right now. This is me being naked. I get uh two mcchickens

2621
06:24:06,159 --> 06:24:10,060
For me those are mine

2622
06:24:11,919 --> 06:24:15,150
and then

2623
06:24:15,150 --> 06:24:17,439
10 piece nugget

2624
06:24:17,439 --> 06:24:19,439
That I share with somebody

2625
06:24:27,060 --> 06:24:29,060
He this is a troll that is not a troll

2626
06:24:34,259 --> 06:24:36,259
So I eat probably like four or five

2627
06:24:37,060 --> 06:24:38,900
chicken mcnuggets

2628
06:24:38,900 --> 06:24:41,139
I eat the full big mac. I eat the mcchicken

2629
06:24:46,659 --> 06:24:52,479
And I eat the second mcchicken

2630
06:24:52,479 --> 06:24:54,479
Now that order does not happen every time

2631
06:24:56,020 --> 06:24:57,700
Delete the big mac

2632
06:24:57,700 --> 06:24:59,700
And I typically will do two mcchickens

2633
06:25:00,020 --> 06:25:04,130
And the 10 piece

2634
06:25:04,130 --> 06:25:06,130
Yes, it does. No, it doesn't

2635
06:25:06,290 --> 06:25:08,930
I got I got a I got a backtrack barry this one. I think

2636
06:25:09,729 --> 06:25:19,150
The 10 piece is a waste of money the 20 piece is 50 cents more

2637
06:25:22,779 --> 06:25:24,779
He eats this every day

2638
06:25:25,500 --> 06:25:28,900
That would be so awful

2639
06:25:28,979 --> 06:25:32,479
All right, let's keep going but mcdonald's is great. I mean, I like wendy's

2640
06:25:33,360 --> 06:25:37,740
I mean, I don't know if this means anything but the last time I had burger king I got a cold

2641
06:25:38,060 --> 06:25:39,580
Does that mean anything?

2642
06:25:39,580 --> 06:25:42,540
I don't know. I like burger king, but the last time I ate it. I got a cold

2643
06:25:43,180 --> 06:25:48,740
That's just true. That's that's I don't maybe it could be not even correlated but it happened

2644
06:26:09,020 --> 06:26:11,020
That's what the star chart said

2645
06:26:14,290 --> 06:26:19,060
No, I haven't eaten burger king. All right

2646
06:26:20,909 --> 06:26:22,909
Burger king sucks

2647
06:26:22,990 --> 06:26:27,869
It like I let's be honest be honest with us and yourself burger king sucks

2648
06:26:29,220 --> 06:26:31,840
but

2649
06:26:31,840 --> 06:26:34,430
Sometimes you just want it

2650
06:26:34,430 --> 06:26:36,270
the long chicken

2651
06:26:36,270 --> 06:26:43,060
The original chicken sandwich is I crave that sometimes. I'm just like, you know, I want long chicken. That sounds good

2652
06:26:43,700 --> 06:26:48,639
But it's just gross. It just is

2653
06:26:49,889 --> 06:26:51,650
And I think they know that too

2654
06:26:51,650 --> 06:26:55,740
But i'm not sure they care very much

2655
06:26:55,740 --> 06:26:58,380
Because they're still one of the big three they still do

2656
06:27:00,540 --> 06:27:02,540
McDonald's is kind of like that too

2657
06:27:06,459 --> 06:27:08,619
Long chicken. Yeah, you'll get a long chicken

2658
06:27:10,029 --> 06:27:16,029
It's okay burger king has this thing called the original chicken sandwich

2659
06:27:17,810 --> 06:27:19,810
If you order a chicken sandwich from burger king

2660
06:27:20,529 --> 06:27:22,669
You are ordering

2661
06:27:22,669 --> 06:27:27,790
A regular. Oh, yeah, it's a patty. It's our crispy chicken sandwich. It's not the long chicken

2662
06:27:30,509 --> 06:27:33,310
They they don't want you to order the long chicken anymore, even though it's better

2663
06:27:34,029 --> 06:27:36,110
They want you to order the tender crisp

2664
06:27:36,750 --> 06:27:40,830
Patty with bacon and ranch sauce. No, you get the long chicken. It's the only one that's good

2665
06:27:48,080 --> 06:27:51,099
burger king

2666
06:27:51,099 --> 06:27:52,380
Long chicken

2667
06:27:52,380 --> 06:27:57,729
There it is. Thank you

2668
06:27:57,729 --> 06:27:59,169
The long chicken

2669
06:27:59,169 --> 06:28:02,400
It's this thing

2670
06:28:02,400 --> 06:28:12,220
I always feel like if I look up a fast food burger and I save the image to my desktop i'm gonna get a virus

2671
06:28:12,619 --> 06:28:16,220
Don't you think that's the easiest fucking way to inject like a trojan in somebody's computer?

2672
06:28:18,450 --> 06:28:19,569
seriously

2673
06:28:19,569 --> 06:28:26,180
I feel like that's so simple

2674
06:28:26,180 --> 06:28:34,560
Like I hope that's not happening

2675
06:28:34,560 --> 06:28:43,279
This thing that's the bk long chicken. It's the only thing on the menu worth ordering anymore

2676
06:28:53,020 --> 06:28:57,099
Speaking of viruses. Make sure you update your windows 10. Why is there something in the wild right now?

2677
06:29:03,310 --> 06:29:06,349
You've never seen that. Yeah, because they they don't want you to order it

2678
06:29:06,909 --> 06:29:13,200
But they like hide it on the menu or something. It's like oh no, we don't want you to get there. We want you to get the

2679
06:29:13,759 --> 06:29:15,040
tender crisp

2680
06:29:15,040 --> 06:29:30,529
Well, we want the chicken zinger burger. What the fuck is this? This is a real what is it? What even is this sandwich?

2681
06:29:33,330 --> 06:29:35,569
Chicken royale. All right, let's finish the bits up

2682
06:29:36,290 --> 06:29:39,389
I'll be left tomorrow morning

2683
06:29:39,389 --> 06:29:42,259
with some wee

2684
06:29:42,259 --> 06:29:44,340
Just some normal guy. Thanks for the

2685
06:29:46,000 --> 06:29:51,900
2,000-bit donations 20 bucks. Love you jerma. Hopefully you do a you'll do return of the king

2686
06:29:52,299 --> 06:29:55,340
I will also i'm sending more bits because I forgot to put a message in the other one

2687
06:29:56,659 --> 06:29:59,060
Yes, you will see return of the king on this stream guaranteed

2688
06:29:59,939 --> 06:30:05,459
Hey gnarly. Thanks for 250 a few weeks ago. You argued with chad about oil changes and why they're a waste of time to do yourself

2689
06:30:06,259 --> 06:30:08,900
Well yesterday, I was reading my micro economics book

2690
06:30:10,049 --> 06:30:13,330
And it talked about how while it is cheaper to do an oil change yourself

2691
06:30:13,970 --> 06:30:17,810
It is more beneficial to pay someone else to do it because of comparative advantage

2692
06:30:18,529 --> 06:30:25,090
Instead of charging your oil or instead of changing your oil for 15 minutes spend that time perfecting your comedy

2693
06:30:25,490 --> 06:30:28,610
Because it makes you happier and wealthier. You're my iq. He was right all along

2694
06:30:29,939 --> 06:30:30,979
I know

2695
06:30:30,979 --> 06:30:38,209
I know. Thanks for the reassurance. Appreciate it ab joe. Thanks for the

2696
06:30:39,310 --> 06:30:42,689
5,000 bits a lot of $50 drops over the last few days

2697
06:30:44,259 --> 06:30:45,380
Thanks guys

2698
06:30:45,380 --> 06:30:49,810
Hello germbo. Good to see you again. Glad your mri went. Okay

2699
06:30:50,369 --> 06:30:52,689
So when are you going to rename the channel points to bald coin?

2700
06:30:53,169 --> 06:30:55,169
I thought that one was a no-brainer

2701
06:30:55,409 --> 06:31:01,819
Much love from one human to another human keep it up. I will thanks for the huge amount of money

2702
06:31:04,580 --> 06:31:07,459
Uh buccas bald because crypto was like a thing

2703
06:31:08,590 --> 06:31:10,909
You know, it still is by the way, it still is

2704
06:31:11,630 --> 06:31:18,290
But that was the big ride up to 20k and it was kind of a thing. It was it was

2705
06:31:19,169 --> 06:31:22,049
Bald coins a little outdated. It is a little dated

2706
06:31:26,349 --> 06:31:27,069
blueberry juice

2707
06:31:27,069 --> 06:31:29,790
Thanks for the 250. Hey germa couldn't catch the lord of the ring stream last week

2708
06:31:29,790 --> 06:31:31,790
So i'm super glad I could catch this one

2709
06:31:31,869 --> 06:31:33,310
It's a lot of fun

2710
06:31:33,310 --> 06:31:34,590
but

2711
06:31:34,590 --> 06:31:37,150
You can bet your sweet compact gnome ass

2712
06:31:37,790 --> 06:31:41,069
That i'm not gonna miss the rhythm heaven fever stream tomorrow

2713
06:31:41,869 --> 06:31:44,990
That game is one of my favorites and I guarantee you will have a great time with it

2714
06:31:45,630 --> 06:31:51,150
By the way, do you know the best method of getting pog stains pog stains out of the carpet?

2715
06:31:51,709 --> 06:31:55,419
Sorry, the wink made me pog a little more than I was

2716
06:31:56,880 --> 06:32:00,590
Oh, yeah, thank you. Um

2717
06:32:01,229 --> 06:32:02,430
Throw it away

2718
06:32:02,430 --> 06:32:08,779
Hey cad. Thanks for the 250 cad b tv. Look here chump. I'm an old diablo 2 pro

2719
06:32:08,779 --> 06:32:11,020
You couldn't last half as long as I couldn't hardcore

2720
06:32:11,819 --> 06:32:14,540
Uh, i'm probably gonna lag in the first 10 minutes

2721
06:32:15,259 --> 06:32:17,259
And die by a stray arrow

2722
06:32:17,900 --> 06:32:20,400
So that's just what happens in that game

2723
06:32:22,909 --> 06:32:25,790
Let's get the credits on the screen. I haven't seen these in a while

2724
06:32:27,569 --> 06:32:34,509
And they are fast stream is still hovering over 10 000 subs still

2725
06:32:38,669 --> 06:32:40,610
almost a full

2726
06:32:40,610 --> 06:32:44,610
More than two weeks later. There's still more than 10 000 people subbed to the channel

2727
06:32:45,250 --> 06:32:49,889
Which is crazy

2728
06:32:49,889 --> 06:32:58,500
Thanks for sticking around. Thanks for subbing much love to all of you

2729
06:33:03,900 --> 06:33:09,419
And then let's finish up the bits. We had hill synth for the 500 bits. They say I miss travis germa pluto. We'll go back

2730
06:33:11,090 --> 06:33:14,930
We'll do we're gonna do all of them. I'm gonna do two. I'm gonna do travis strikes again

2731
06:33:15,490 --> 06:33:16,770
I'm gonna do three

2732
06:33:16,770 --> 06:33:22,000
So don't worry. We're gonna we'll do them. There's a lot to do. I'm just busy

2733
06:33:23,139 --> 06:33:25,939
Trying to do as much as I can the time that I have

2734
06:33:30,270 --> 06:33:36,590
Hey memey. Thanks memey for the 400 bits. Thank you to quarter dime for the 200 bits. He got it wrong again

2735
06:33:37,150 --> 06:33:39,470
It's 250 Jeremy, but you gotta read it now

2736
06:33:40,110 --> 06:33:47,389
They say the problem with mental health is that people are often mentally unwell to treat their mental illness

2737
06:33:47,389 --> 06:33:50,830
It's like if the solution to a broken leg was to travel to the hospital on foot

2738
06:33:55,069 --> 06:33:58,500
I think the

2739
06:33:58,500 --> 06:34:00,529
the issue is

2740
06:34:00,529 --> 06:34:01,729
trying to

2741
06:34:01,729 --> 06:34:03,729
Get there before it gets there

2742
06:34:03,729 --> 06:34:05,889
It's hard to do

2743
06:34:05,889 --> 06:34:19,470
Travis strikes again is interesting for referencing soot as other work, but it's probably the worst no more heroes game

2744
06:34:19,549 --> 06:34:21,549
But not terrible, but still yeah

2745
06:34:22,189 --> 06:34:27,459
But what I mean is okay, like you said if you have a broken leg and you want to walk to the hospital on foot

2746
06:34:30,319 --> 06:34:32,240
Yeah, you would never do that

2747
06:34:32,240 --> 06:34:35,150
But it's harder to

2748
06:34:35,150 --> 06:34:38,209
It's harder to to not get to that state

2749
06:34:39,169 --> 06:34:44,639
With mental illness because it's not something that anybody can see

2750
06:34:45,599 --> 06:34:52,240
Right. It's not something that anybody can true. Oh that person. Well, that person has a broken leg. Everybody knows that they can see that

2751
06:34:52,880 --> 06:34:56,880
so it's harder to

2752
06:34:56,880 --> 06:35:03,099
To do and it can stay

2753
06:35:04,060 --> 06:35:07,009
You mentioned broken legs

2754
06:35:07,169 --> 06:35:09,729
The broken leg is a broken leg and it has to be treated immediately

2755
06:35:10,509 --> 06:35:13,419
immediately

2756
06:35:13,419 --> 06:35:14,860
something like

2757
06:35:14,860 --> 06:35:16,860
depression or mental health problems

2758
06:35:17,580 --> 06:35:22,619
They can stay dormant for a long time and they can slowly build up and over time

2759
06:35:23,340 --> 06:35:25,340
Years get worse and worse

2760
06:35:25,419 --> 06:35:30,130
And it's trying to find that spot

2761
06:35:31,419 --> 06:35:35,099
Where you haven't like you say in quotes like have the broken leg

2762
06:35:38,319 --> 06:35:45,099
Over time. It's tricky though

2763
06:35:45,500 --> 06:35:51,840
It is very tricky

2764
06:35:51,840 --> 06:35:54,159
We had these those 20 community subs

2765
06:35:54,959 --> 06:35:56,959
from supper eyes

2766
06:35:57,279 --> 06:35:59,279
Thank you supper eyes

2767
06:35:59,360 --> 06:36:01,409
A lot of subs. Thank you

2768
06:36:01,409 --> 06:36:05,380
How do you guys pronounce co-op juke like that?

2769
06:36:07,419 --> 06:36:09,259
Hey, jillette. Thanks jillette for the 250

2770
06:36:09,259 --> 06:36:13,819
I've been struggling a lot with addiction and depression and watching your streams and vods helped me a lot for these times

2771
06:36:14,540 --> 06:36:17,259
I was having a pretty rough day until I watched today. Thank you for everything

2772
06:36:21,500 --> 06:36:23,659
Yeah, it's the same stuff. We were talking about before

2773
06:36:27,900 --> 06:36:33,330
same boat

2774
06:36:33,330 --> 06:36:35,330
addiction depression anxiety

2775
06:36:37,229 --> 06:36:39,229
And same boat but different paddles

2776
06:36:39,630 --> 06:36:42,209
You know what I mean? It's they're they're all in the same

2777
06:36:42,770 --> 06:36:46,029
realm

2778
06:36:46,029 --> 06:36:47,630
And how to treat them?

2779
06:36:47,709 --> 06:36:51,630
There's a lot of different ways that people would say is better or worse

2780
06:36:52,590 --> 06:37:00,819
but hopefully

2781
06:37:00,819 --> 06:37:02,959
You know over time

2782
06:37:02,959 --> 06:37:05,229
You can figure it out

2783
06:37:05,229 --> 06:37:07,229
the necessary help and the necessary

2784
06:37:08,110 --> 06:37:10,110
The support group right because everybody needs it

2785
06:37:10,669 --> 06:37:19,500
I'm going to be stealing that analogy. Well

2786
06:37:19,979 --> 06:37:22,080
It's free

2787
06:37:22,080 --> 06:37:24,900
It's free you can have it

2788
06:37:26,959 --> 06:37:29,340
Thank you, jillette

2789
06:37:29,340 --> 06:37:31,340
I wish you luck with

2790
06:37:31,659 --> 06:37:36,209
Your addiction and your depression

2791
06:37:36,209 --> 06:37:38,209
Not something to be taken lightly, of course

2792
06:37:39,939 --> 06:37:47,090
Thank you. Good luck. Just some normal guy gave 400 bits

2793
06:37:47,650 --> 06:37:52,930
Hey germa the whole talk about mental health made me want to say this with bits to anyone who has any mental problems or know

2794
06:37:53,009 --> 06:37:54,529
someone who does

2795
06:37:54,529 --> 06:37:56,500
I had a friend long ago

2796
06:37:56,500 --> 06:38:00,900
Who did commit suicide and it killed me inside that he didn't talk to me before he did it or said anything

2797
06:38:01,540 --> 06:38:05,700
Just know that if you are suffering with mental problems, there's always someone there. You can talk to who loves you

2798
06:38:06,500 --> 06:38:19,169
I'm really sorry to hear that the best thing that you really can do if you really think that you have

2799
06:38:21,709 --> 06:38:26,509
These kind of terrible thoughts that you do, you know, you do you think to yourself I shouldn't be having these this is

2800
06:38:27,549 --> 06:38:29,549
This this is not good. This is not good

2801
06:38:30,110 --> 06:38:39,840
You got to reach out to somebody and hopefully that person is somebody that's equipped to help you

2802
06:38:47,740 --> 06:38:50,459
Call the hotline of need be call the hotline therapy

2803
06:38:53,860 --> 06:38:55,939
And try just day to day to

2804
06:38:56,819 --> 06:38:59,810
I mean, it's it's really easy for me to sit here and go well

2805
06:38:59,970 --> 06:39:02,930
Just try to make yourself feel better, you know with small things little things

2806
06:39:05,950 --> 06:39:07,950
While you try to get the help that you need

2807
06:39:08,029 --> 06:39:14,939
Try to find things that make you happy

2808
06:39:16,029 --> 06:39:17,950
Not things that make you unhappy

2809
06:39:17,950 --> 06:39:21,020
I've talked about it a few times for me

2810
06:39:22,419 --> 06:39:24,580
Whenever I feel bad and I felt

2811
06:39:25,380 --> 06:39:27,680
I felt pretty bad

2812
06:39:27,759 --> 06:39:29,409
over the last

2813
06:39:29,409 --> 06:39:31,569
Couple decades, you know, it's everybody can get

2814
06:39:32,450 --> 06:39:34,450
Some type of uh, you know feeling down

2815
06:39:35,310 --> 06:39:38,909
And not feeling like things are going well, and I think i've made even videos on this

2816
06:39:41,919 --> 06:39:46,799
I got happiness and I sought happiness by making other people happy

2817
06:39:50,049 --> 06:39:52,049
That's I wanted to make somebody

2818
06:39:52,689 --> 06:39:57,970
I want to make somebody else life easier. I want to make somebody else laugh. I want I wanted to watch somebody

2819
06:39:59,169 --> 06:40:01,090
Be excited about something

2820
06:40:01,090 --> 06:40:04,610
That made me feel good showing somebody something caring about something making

2821
06:40:05,729 --> 06:40:07,090
making somebody

2822
06:40:07,090 --> 06:40:10,770
part of a conversation and you what do you think about that and see what they say and

2823
06:40:11,569 --> 06:40:16,049
That's how I always tried to get myself out of potential ruts that I was in was trying to make other people happy

2824
06:40:16,849 --> 06:40:19,250
Because in my mind it's like if I couldn't make myself happy

2825
06:40:19,889 --> 06:40:22,209
I could make other people happy

2826
06:40:22,209 --> 06:40:25,490
And in return that helped me that made me happy

2827
06:40:26,529 --> 06:40:28,529
in sort of a rebound way

2828
06:40:28,529 --> 06:40:31,919
same thing with animals, too, I

2829
06:40:32,479 --> 06:40:34,479
Like I said previously I worked

2830
06:40:35,040 --> 06:40:37,119
I volunteered at an animal shelter and it was just

2831
06:40:38,209 --> 06:40:41,169
It made me feel good. It just made it made me feel good

2832
06:40:43,900 --> 06:40:47,500
because helping other people or helping other things it actually

2833
06:40:48,770 --> 06:40:50,770
It doesn't it doesn't at least it doesn't for me

2834
06:40:55,700 --> 06:40:58,500
like what when somebody says something

2835
06:40:59,060 --> 06:41:05,169
like when I when i'm done streaming and I look back and look at some of the things people saying in the comments and

2836
06:41:05,970 --> 06:41:08,450
The reddit threads and some of the memes and shit that people say

2837
06:41:10,639 --> 06:41:15,200
If people say how oh this was that was fun. That was really fun stuff

2838
06:41:15,759 --> 06:41:20,779
I had a great fucking time. That was a great stream. I'm just like, all right, that's fucking exactly

2839
06:41:20,939 --> 06:41:22,939
That's exactly what i'm looking for

2840
06:41:25,259 --> 06:41:27,740
You have to kind of find your own ways to fight

2841
06:41:28,459 --> 06:41:31,650
Your own ways to battle it

2842
06:41:31,650 --> 06:41:39,979
Everybody's different. Do I read the 4chan threads on you?

2843
06:41:41,970 --> 06:41:43,090
No

2844
06:41:43,090 --> 06:41:45,090
No, I don't really read that

2845
06:41:45,330 --> 06:41:54,830
Not really. I hope I hope people I hope they I hope they like me and if they don't then that's all right

2846
06:41:56,419 --> 06:41:57,700
You know saying

2847
06:41:57,700 --> 06:42:04,340
I have nothing against anybody that if that's somebody if they do or do not like the things I do

2848
06:42:05,380 --> 06:42:09,090
That's all right. Well, i'm not gonna i'm not gonna be like how fucking dare you

2849
06:42:09,970 --> 06:42:12,819
Why don't you like me? Well, how could you like it?

2850
06:42:14,020 --> 06:42:16,900
People have their own shit. They have their own things. I think are interesting

2851
06:42:20,450 --> 06:42:22,450
I've read those threads. No, they like you

2852
06:42:24,979 --> 06:42:27,139
Yeah, but it's not everybody though

2853
06:42:27,220 --> 06:42:33,700
And like you can't I know that I can't make everybody think that these streams are fun and interesting and I know for a fact

2854
06:42:34,580 --> 06:42:51,340
It's getting windy. You guys hear that

2855
06:42:52,060 --> 06:42:53,819
that was like

2856
06:42:53,819 --> 06:42:57,459
That was big

2857
06:42:57,459 --> 06:43:00,099
Um, no, but to finish that thought up

2858
06:43:02,779 --> 06:43:07,180
And wherever you probably hanging out on message boards or whatever websites you're on

2859
06:43:12,180 --> 06:43:14,900
Thanks for even watching it all even if you don't like it

2860
06:43:16,529 --> 06:43:19,729
And if you do then thanks again, because obviously you're still here

2861
06:43:24,130 --> 06:43:26,130
We have gone over a couple times

2862
06:43:26,290 --> 06:43:29,409
About the whole like oh like fuck the haters

2863
06:43:29,970 --> 06:43:32,130
Fuck if you fucking got fuck the haters

2864
06:43:33,540 --> 06:43:37,540
I don't care. I don't like I if you don't if you don't like me then

2865
06:43:38,979 --> 06:43:41,580
That's fine

2866
06:43:41,580 --> 06:43:43,580
I find I find that the visa is

2867
06:43:43,900 --> 06:44:00,419
Sort of abrasive with that kind of mentality when you're gonna go on oprah

2868
06:44:01,889 --> 06:44:03,889
Can I get on oprah? Will they get me on oprah?

2869
06:44:05,380 --> 06:44:08,099
That sounds like a roundabout way saying fuck the haters

2870
06:44:16,029 --> 06:44:18,110
No, I re seriously seriously

2871
06:44:22,130 --> 06:44:26,159
Go on konan

2872
06:44:26,159 --> 06:44:31,040
I've seen some threads in reddit. I've seen some stuff on 4chan. I've seen it when um,

2873
06:44:31,919 --> 06:44:34,319
somebody linked me when the

2874
06:44:34,319 --> 06:44:39,040
German rumbles were going on the live ones at one point somebody linked me a thread and people were having fun

2875
06:44:39,200 --> 06:44:41,200
And that's that's that's all I care about

2876
06:44:41,439 --> 06:44:55,330
Go on konan so we can compare heights

2877
06:45:00,610 --> 06:45:03,409
All right. Let's finish this up snoozing copter 250 from snoozing copter

2878
06:45:04,770 --> 06:45:06,930
Hey, it's really late here. Or should I say early?

2879
06:45:07,650 --> 06:45:12,770
It's 8 a.m. Now and i've been up the whole night yesterday. I woke up at 8 30 p.m. Yes, I know

2880
06:45:13,569 --> 06:45:18,130
It's been like this for three months now after the jet lag coming back to germany. I've been there before

2881
06:45:19,330 --> 06:45:21,330
I have been there before

2882
06:45:23,169 --> 06:45:25,169
It can it can fuck with you

2883
06:45:26,669 --> 06:45:31,069
I'm finally working on reversing it, but it's really demotivating waking up when the day is already over

2884
06:45:31,869 --> 06:45:34,990
Can you say in your cheers to you voice to go to bed with applause in the back?

2885
06:45:36,509 --> 06:46:04,430
We want to thank you for staying up with the stream

2886
06:46:07,180 --> 06:46:09,180
But it's time to go to bed now

2887
06:46:09,819 --> 06:46:13,470
Put your head down

2888
06:46:14,130 --> 06:46:16,130
Listen to this music

2889
06:46:17,299 --> 06:46:19,299
Get ready

2890
06:46:19,840 --> 06:46:21,840
Because here it comes

2891
06:46:23,500 --> 06:46:25,819
We want to thank you for being asleep

2892
06:46:29,439 --> 06:46:37,900
There you go. You know, i've made comments about what the best video on youtube is

2893
06:46:38,540 --> 06:46:40,299
And i'm not sure that one counts

2894
06:46:40,299 --> 06:46:42,939
But that's the that's one of the best pieces of media

2895
06:46:43,740 --> 06:46:47,259
That's ever been produced. It is that's the one that's the best piece of media

2896
06:46:49,659 --> 06:46:51,659
It's the the hog calling. No

2897
06:46:51,740 --> 06:46:55,819
Now cheers to you is the single greatest achievement. I think of all of humanity

2898
06:46:59,330 --> 06:47:01,490
When you look sleep up in the dictionary

2899
06:47:02,529 --> 06:47:05,090
There's your picture

2900
06:47:05,169 --> 06:47:06,529
It's there

2901
06:47:06,529 --> 06:47:15,490
How many views does that video have? It's it's probably like 32 000 or something, right?

2902
06:47:18,080 --> 06:47:20,080
93 000 views. Yeah

2903
06:47:21,180 --> 06:47:23,659
And how many of those views are have been us?

2904
06:47:26,349 --> 06:47:30,590
Because part two has 14 000 views part one has 100

2905
06:47:32,349 --> 06:47:37,500
I know for a fact i've watched this video at least 30 times at least

2906
06:47:39,919 --> 06:47:42,400
