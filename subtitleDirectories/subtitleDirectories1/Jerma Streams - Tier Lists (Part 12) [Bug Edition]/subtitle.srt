1
00:00:02,299 --> 00:00:27,079
How you doing? Hey, welcome back. Welcome back. Good to see you again. Just typing some stuff.

2
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:36,280
Getting some stuff ready. Hope you're having a good day. I'm having a pretty good day and I'll tell

3
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:47,689
you why. First of all, I am negative for COVID. I don't know how. I'm better today. But if you

4
00:00:47,770 --> 00:01:00,820
heard me a day or two ago, holly is positive. So I mean, I've been in the house. I've been sick.

5
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:10,409
I don't have COVID. I have symptoms. It's weird. Negative on a PCR. Whatever. All right, let's go,

6
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:22,260
I guess. There's no way it's a false negative. Dude, I took if that if it's a false negative,

7
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,780
then holy shit. I've taken probably eight at home tests. All of them are negative.

8
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:34,500
I took a PCR that had to get sent to a lab. Negative. At this point, I don't know. I have

9
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:41,849
absolutely no idea. That's just strange, right? Holly's fine. Yeah, she's fine. She's getting

10
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:55,290
over it. She's over the over the hump. I got COVID and it took three days after I had symptoms to

11
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:01,219
show up positive. I mean, I've it's it's been three or four days, five days, whatever it is,

12
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:09,939
right? It's been a while. It's been at least four or five days. And I I feel better today,

13
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:15,699
and a little bit into yesterday. So when I was streaming that my time at Porsche, that's when

14
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:24,650
I kind of felt the worst. So I don't know. But anyways, yes, negative for COVID. That's good.

15
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,979
For now, I guess we'll see. Probably gonna take another test at home, maybe another day or two,

16
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:38,979
just to make sure. But so we've got a lot to talk about today. A major amount of things to talk

17
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:43,689
about. And some of them you're going to be very happy about. The first thing we're going to go

18
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:50,810
over today is wait till people get in. Wait till people get in. It's a very big deal. I think a lot

19
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:58,740
of you guys are going to be really happy to hear this. This is a big deal. Huge deal. Big deal.

20
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:08,330
Incoming. How many people are here? 100? How many people? Wait, are there 100 people here?

21
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:20,740
Was there 100 people? Is there 100? Is there at least 100? Okay, this weekend, first of all,

22
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,620
yeah, I would just relax for a second. Sit down. You're gonna have to sit down for this one.

23
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:31,539
This Friday, because we passed a million followers on Twitch a couple days ago,

24
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:40,409
I thought, wouldn't it be fun? Maybe I'd never I told you I had this idea. Well, I'm gonna do it.

25
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:48,310
I'm going for it. This Friday and Saturday back to back for a million followers on Twitch.

26
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:57,259
Ladies and gentlemen, we're going back to sorcery. That's right. I'm going to play through

27
00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:10,250
sorcery again. The first game that I started with on Twitch, we are rewinding all the way back to

28
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:18,040
sorcery episode one. For those of you that have no idea what this is. Good. Don't even look it up.

29
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:27,860
Well, yeah, you should look it up because it's awesome. Yeah, we're going back and redoing it,

30
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:35,050
man. Recycling content. That's what we're doing. That's the that's the first game I streamed on

31
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:44,779
Twitch. I think. I think I didn't even think I had 500 viewers on those streams. It's been a long

32
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:53,259
time. So we're at least going to do part one and part two. And I mean, there's a lot of new viewers

33
00:04:53,339 --> 00:05:01,339
here that have no idea. The sus command that you all know sus in the chat is from that game. It's

34
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:15,339
not among us. It's from fucking sorcery. It's sense danger. It's not sus. So we're going to do

35
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:21,459
that with Friday. This Friday, we're going to do it. I'm going to get wicked into it. I'll have a

36
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:29,000
few beers. I'll do a bunch of shitty voices should be fun. And then probably do that into Saturday

37
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,939
too. Maybe we'll see. No rewinds. We'll we'll come up with a rule set. I think it'd be fun to do

38
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:47,509
though. And then on Sunday, guess what's happening on Sunday. It has pretty much been confirmed.

39
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:58,730
A green screen movie night. Episode three. Green screen movie night is this Sunday.

40
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:08,899
And I'm ready. Now, if there is a hang up, then we can we'll do it another time, right? We'll do

41
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:14,100
it another day or two later. But I think we're on pace to be able to do the first one at least.

42
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:31,750
So that's that's exciting. A lot of shit happening this weekend. My grandparents are coming over. Can

43
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:43,639
we do this later? What do you mean? Can we do what later? I'm on your television right now.

44
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:53,779
Hit pause and come back. Okay, hit pause right now. Just leave your you know, leave the tab open.

45
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,300
Whatever you minimize the screen, whatever, put your computer to sleep, whatever.

46
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:06,089
And then come back after and so so pause right now. I'll welcome you back. There you are.

47
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:11,579
How was that time with the grandparents? See? And you got to have time with your grandparents. And

48
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:21,379
now you get to watch the rest of the stream. Welcome back. Let's go. Can we switch the stream

49
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:33,610
to Tuesday? No, it's it's Sunday. So today, we're I'm very excited for today. I've been waiting for

50
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:41,620
this game to come back as one of the best Bugs Bunny players in the fucking world. Okay. And guess

51
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:49,139
what? I can say that. Do you know why I can say that? There are 8 billion people in the world.

52
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:54,860
Probably only like maybe a few million have even seen this game or played it at all multiverses.

53
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:02,540
Of those people, let's say maybe like 10 to 20,000 of them play Bugs Bunny. And let's say that maybe

54
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:10,389
5,000 of them have played more than 20 games as Bugs Bunny. That's small company right there.

55
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:15,670
That's 5,000 people in the world. I'm one of 5,000 people on earth potentially,

56
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:33,419
which is insane, right? I can say that. This dude's on meth. Oh, egotistical math. I can't read it,

57
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:46,779
guys. I'm sorry. But I'm I'm very excited for multiverses. This stream is going to be sponsored

58
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,700
eventually here. There's some things that I told people I was going to do and we have to wait a

59
00:08:51,700 --> 00:09:00,759
little bit. So yeah, I'm so happy. I I love this game. I think it's fucking awesome. And it's going

60
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:09,299
to be a sponsored stream. You kidding me? Like, are you kidding me? And this is going to be drops.

61
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,299
So just wait, we'll go over that later. But I have some important things to do first.

62
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:32,149
I believe the drops will get you access to the game. You have to watch for a certain amount of

63
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:45,580
time with drops enabled. We'll get there eventually. Drops, drops, drops, drops, drops, drops, drops,

64
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:50,419
drops, drops, drops, drops, drops, drops, drops, drops. That's what I want to see in the chat when

65
00:09:50,419 --> 00:10:07,080
I play. Oh, stop. Come on. For those of you that don't like bugs, I'm about to ruin your life

66
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:15,830
because I have to do a bug tier list. There's some, I don't know, some weirdo in the chat said,

67
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:20,629
hey, dude, you should do a bug tier list while you hang out and wait. And I'm like, well, hey,

68
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:27,379
okay, fine. So if you don't like bugs, if you don't like the sight of bugs, they're going to

69
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:35,929
be on the screen. So I want to make sure people know that before I switch over right now. Bugs,

70
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:46,950
bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs. Spider is S rank. Nope. I think I'm

71
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:53,019
going to surprise a lot of people with what my S rank bugs are. So we have to let's go over what

72
00:10:53,019 --> 00:11:04,419
this means, right? Come on, let me, let's go over here. Okay. So there's bugs on the screen right

73
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:13,220
now. I just want to make you be aware of that. So here's how this is going to work. Yeah. Somebody,

74
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,940
somebody made this list and put it in chat. It's a comedy list. All right. We're going to,

75
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:22,259
there's a comedy tier. I, it's, I'm not going to put, okay, it's a comedy tier.

76
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:29,179
So here's what's going to happen. This is based on how much I like this insect,

77
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:36,139
not about how effective they are in helping the environment, ecosystems, nothing like that.

78
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:46,440
This is just how I feel about this bug. Okay. So this is how I personally feel. So let me,

79
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:54,090
let's, let's break down what this means. So if I saw one of these bugs crawl across the ground,

80
00:11:54,090 --> 00:12:08,940
this is the reaction like, oh, or like, oh, look. Okay. Are you ready? I don't even know. I,

81
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:15,429
I think this is a fish. Whoever made this list. This is a comedy. It's a fish. This is not a bug.

82
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:21,750
It's a fish. Let's look. Okay. Let's do this. Let's get this out of the way. This is comedy.

83
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:32,039
This is Bugs Bunny. This is not a bug. This is Bumblebee who is not a bug. It's Bumblebee,

84
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:35,960
the character from Transformers. Cool. Hollow Knight is also, what kind of bug is Hollow Knight?

85
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:49,820
A beetle? I'll, I'll put these in the right order. And by the way, why the fuck is Plok not playing?

86
00:12:49,820 --> 00:13:01,879
Okay. B-movie. No, you're, it's a comedy thing. That's a little loud. Let me turn it down.

87
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:16,149
I'll fit, this is a Mega Man character. So I'm not going to, who cares? This is a crab. Is this

88
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:26,200
comedy? This is comedy. This is a lobster. I honestly thought this was also a lobster,

89
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,519
but that just shows you how closely related these things are to fucking bugs. You know what I mean?

90
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:37,769
Look at that. This is just like Chad and Virgin, version of this animal. They're the same exact

91
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:44,360
animal. They're the same exact animal. This one just had the Ninja Turtle Ooze put on it.

92
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:53,159
I'm sorry. And this one has like a stinger, whatever. This is two lobsters. These aren't

93
00:13:53,159 --> 00:14:00,899
even bugs, dude. All right. This is the first real bug. You, okay. This is a lobster and a

94
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:09,929
cooked lobster. What are you doing? Who gave this to me? All right. Scorpion. Scorpions. Okay. If I

95
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:16,600
saw a scorpion crawling across the ground. No, that's, they, they fucked up. They're scary.

96
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:27,370
I'm not into it. They're terrifying. And they, I mean, are they cool? Not really. Sure. I guess

97
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:35,110
they're, I don't hate scorpions. I'm not afraid of them, but I would put it in C.

98
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:41,220
I just, who cares? Should I do my S one? Cause people are going to, people are going to hate

99
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:46,440
me for this. Are you ready for my S tier bug? I don't know if you guys are ready for this

100
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:52,389
cause I know exactly which one it is. And people are going to freak out. I don't hate these. I

101
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:58,230
think these are cute. I think these are fun. They have like little faces. I don't actually

102
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,870
hate these. And I know people are going to be like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

103
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:06,379
I in fact think earwigs are really, really interesting animal. I think they're really

104
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:15,269
cute. I think they're really interesting. I, people hate earwigs. Why? They don't hurt,

105
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:18,070
they don't bite anybody. They don't do anything. They just kind of walk around and they're,

106
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:25,139
they're cute. This is a cockroach. No, it's not. An earwig is not a cockroach. And they have like

107
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:33,529
a cool, like cut butt. I don't think it's all the way at S tier, but I think it's up there.

108
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:41,210
Oh, we can't see S tier. Well, now you can. Oh, this is comedy. Ants are high too. Is it,

109
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:47,460
okay. That's, that's red ants though. Are there regular ants instead of red ants?

110
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:54,889
Just ant. Cause that's a fire ant technically, right? Which I wouldn't put fire ant up at A.

111
00:15:54,889 --> 00:16:13,299
They, they're, they're scary. Can it just be like ant in general? Fucking beetles. Can I just say

112
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:16,820
this is just, just an ant? Let's just, cause if it's a fire ant, I don't want it up there.

113
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:23,529
But regular ants are really cute. Also, when I was younger, I used to love this movie called

114
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:30,470
Honey I Shrunk the Kids. Rick Moranis was in it. And there was a scene where Auntie protects them

115
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:37,100
from the scary scorpion. And Auntie was awesome. Auntie helps the kids and fuck this thing. You

116
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:54,419
know what I mean? I like ants. So that's how I feel. What is this? What is that thing? I don't

117
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:59,419
know. Whatever it is, it's dumb. It's an aphid. Oh, these things are all of a plant and they're

118
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:05,579
annoying. Yeah. Get rid of these. I hate these things. These things just appear magically on

119
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:11,000
all of your crops. They're the worst. This is a butterfly. Butterflies are, I mean, it's easy to

120
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,779
put butterfly up at S. And I'm going to. And it's, yeah, I would, it's cooler than an earwig.

121
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:22,119
Bumblebee. No, this is a honeybee or whatever. Just bee in general. Bee is S tier. I'm going

122
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:41,740
to shrink this a little bit so you can see more of it. There we go. That's better. Okay. What is

123
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:47,910
this? It's just like a kind of a cool beetle. I don't know what that is. Bees are based. Yeah,

124
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:59,720
bees are based. It's definitely S. What's that called? A bee drill? That's a stink bug? That's

125
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:11,829
American beetle. Butterfly S. This is a, this is a pre-evolution butterfly. I actually, I don't know

126
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:18,859
what, something about the way they move is weird. I'm going to put it down at B. F for a centipede.

127
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:25,940
No thanks. That's cool. Whatever it is. This is a crane fly. I would put this at F, but I'm going to

128
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:31,829
put this up here because everybody always points at these and goes, no, they're good. They don't

129
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:37,019
hurt. They don't bite you. What do you mean F? What do you mean moth at A? What are you talking

130
00:18:37,019 --> 00:18:58,740
about? This is a moth. So what? Moths suck. A moth is a butterfly from like different parents.

131
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:07,480
What's with this, this anti-moth propaganda that I've been seeing? Why do you like butterflies,

132
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:16,789
but not moths? Explain that to me. Because moths like will, will, I don't, please explain to me.

133
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:21,509
They're just a fuzzy butterfly. Now some moths are kind of weird and gross. I agree with you,

134
00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:31,160
but not all of them are. It's a, it's a, it's just a fuzzy butterfly. You like these because

135
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:48,680
they have prettier colors. Oh, this one's blue. Therefore I like it. Huh. I, I, okay. I, I think

136
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:56,089
butterflies are more like, oh, they, they drink and moths are, aren't they like nocturnal? They're

137
00:19:56,089 --> 00:20:07,589
like the cool like nighttime version of butterflies. They're cool. That's cool. I don't know why

138
00:20:07,589 --> 00:20:11,750
everybody hated moths up for, for no reason. I think it's just because that people think of moths

139
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:18,789
and they think of the weird like paper mache white ones, right? And everyone's like, oh, gross.

140
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:23,750
The ones that are like, they look like, like, like paper mache and everybody, then everybody hates

141
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:35,509
all the other ones. It's weird. Yeah. I, I, moths are fine. I, moths are fine. They can be, they can

142
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:44,390
be cute. Moths ate my pants. Well, keep your closet door closed. Keep your, you know, what are you

143
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:52,440
talking about? Inspect your clothing once in a while. If a moth is able to eat your entire

144
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:58,900
wardrobe, you probably should have paid attention to what was going on in your closet. Would you

145
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,740
just open your closet one day and there's like 12 moths in there just eating the, your whole,

146
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:07,799
all your fucking dress shirts? Like what are you talking about? Keep an eye on your shit.

147
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:26,740
Is this a locust? Because these are F. Is this a grasshopper or a locust? What was the last time

148
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:42,420
you opened up your closet? That's a cricket? Oh, this is a good, this is one of the good ones.

149
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:50,579
Here it is. Grasshoppers are green. Oh, it's a cricket. Crickets are really fucking annoying.

150
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:55,460
There was a cricket outside last night. I swear to God, I always wanted to record it, like,

151
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:02,920
just get audio recorded because this thing was so loud and it was going super speed. It wasn't

152
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:17,700
This guy was looking for somebody. It was like, just like, what is it? It was hurt. It was like

153
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:26,420
static. I couldn't stand it. It was just like the cricket sound and that went on for hours and

154
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:36,059
hours and hours. They had to like turn a fan on to block it out. It was horrible. They're cute.

155
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:42,779
They're fine. I don't have a problem with crickets. It was really down bad cricket.

156
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:50,420
I just imagine him sitting on his back with his legs in the air, just like, come on,

157
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:56,660
there's got to be somebody out there. His legs catch fire.

158
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:11,380
Dragonflies, Esther, don't even need to spend time on it. Don't even need to spend time on it.

159
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:23,779
Dragonflies, Esther, please rate non-insects. Look, I know there's a lot of, a lot of,

160
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:32,859
turn this down. It's kind of loud for me. I know dragonflies are really awesome because they're

161
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:38,779
kind of like hummingbirds where you almost feel blessed when a dragonfly comes near you.

162
00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:44,039
You put your hand, you're like, oh my God, because they're one of the only animals on earth that

163
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:52,789
will freeze in front of you and stop time. What do you mean false? Yeah, a hummingbird sometimes,

164
00:23:53,509 --> 00:23:57,029
especially out here, it'll be sitting outside just hanging out. You'll hear

165
00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:05,109
and the world stops. All time stops. And it's just this thing frozen, floating in front of you.

166
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:14,059
Just it's like, holy shit. And then they're gone. And it's just like, whoa, like, I feel like magical

167
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:19,900
dust just got kind of sprinkled on me. Dragonflies do that. A dragonfly will come zooming by. Zoom,

168
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:28,200
zoom, zoom, zoom. I love it. It's so cool. That's why they're up at S. And they're, by the way,

169
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:39,220
they're cooler than butterflies. Put moth and S tier, please. I, I, we'll see, maybe. Dung beetle,

170
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:45,640
uh, I want to put this at S tier because they're funny and they do like that. They move it. Yeah,

171
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:59,019
come on. They're so fun. I could, okay. If there was a, a YouTube channel or like a

172
00:24:59,019 --> 00:25:03,289
Twitch channel that just streamed dung beetles pushing around shit all day,

173
00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:09,509
it would just be in the background. I would just have it up all day. It'd be up all day.

174
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:18,549
No, that doesn't go in comedy tier. They're not a comedy insect. This is just somebody put these in

175
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:28,410
here to be funny. There's another moth. Put it up here. There's another fuzzy one. What is that?

176
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:39,380
Whatever this is, this is cool looking. I like it. I don't know what it is. Those are pill bugs.

177
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:49,049
That's a firefly. Yep. What a remarkable creature. This thing can produce light out

178
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:54,950
of its anus. No, nobody else can do that. No other monster on earth can do that.

179
00:25:54,950 --> 00:26:02,180
No creatures on earth can do that. It just generates light. How? That makes no sense.

180
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:11,349
Like an angler fish. Yeah. There are a couple of creatures on this strange wild earth that we have

181
00:26:11,349 --> 00:26:18,180
that they can just make light from nothing. How do you make light without electricity or without

182
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:28,710
some type of source? It's so strange to me. How does it work? It's magic. It's a chemical reaction.

183
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:37,400
That's what I mean. It's so weird. So chemicals mixed together can make light. What? It's

184
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:54,920
bioluminescence. Some fucking scientist made that up. What you should have said is it's a glow stick.

185
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:04,470
I know. I'm just kidding. I just made a lot of people very upset and I was fucking kidding.

186
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:15,720
Just relax. So it's like a glow stick. Yeah, you go. I'm fucking kidding. Relax, everybody.

187
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:23,240
Slow down. Does he actually? But stop. Oh my God. Oh, we're moving on. This is like a peapod. It gets

188
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:36,710
F. This is a kangaroo bug. F. Fly. F. I. Okay. Let me tell you a quick little story about flies.

189
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:45,180
I love most creatures on earth. I do. But I don't know what it is. If I saw any of these,

190
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:51,109
I wouldn't want to smash it with a shoe as hard as I can. Right? Sometimes, yeah, it's like,

191
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:57,589
okay, get it, get it, get it. Something about a housefly makes me just want to just smash.

192
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:05,960
Just smash it. I hate them. When I see and hear those motherfuckers, I swear to God,

193
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,000
it just triggers something in me where I'm just like, get out of my house. Get away from me. Don't

194
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:18,059
come near me. I hate them. Ugh. And they piss you off because they're so hard to get rid of

195
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:22,700
because they fly see the world and a lot of insects see the world. In my opinion,

196
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:28,569
we've talked about this a little bit briefly. Insects, you know, when you go to slam something,

197
00:28:28,569 --> 00:28:32,410
you end up being like the attack on Titan, like colossal Titan, and it's like,

198
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:39,380
you're moving in slow motion. All these bugs that have their heart rates at like 6,000 beats per

199
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:46,619
minute, whatever the hell it is, they are just like perceiving the world at like 0.2 time speed.

200
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:52,900
So that's why they can dodge you all the time. The reason why bugs only live like fucking 12

201
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:59,000
days is because their 12 days is like 50 years to us. Just look at how an insect reacts. Just

202
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,680
look at an insect under a microscope, whatever the hell they do, or with like a times like 50

203
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:13,180
million zoom camera. Their eyes and their hands, like they, it's fucking crazy. There's no way they

204
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:22,230
don't perceive the world like 400 times slower than we do. Birds do this too. Birds being able

205
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:30,859
to go from here to here by the time that you blink your eyes is, that's like mechanical. Birds

206
00:29:30,859 --> 00:29:41,160
are almost mechanical. Bugs are almost mechanical. It's wild, but I want to crush them every time I

207
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:49,130
see these guys because they dodge everything and they, they don't care. Most of these other bugs

208
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:53,210
will just leave you alone. Like an earwig, for instance, based. An earwig is just going to kind

209
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:59,220
of like, I'm an earwig and just kind of walk around and who cares? These don't, won't leave

210
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:06,019
you alone. They land on your head. They land on your food. They get, they're horrible. They,

211
00:30:06,019 --> 00:30:10,259
they won't leave you the fuck alone. Most of these others just kind of live their life. Dung beetle

212
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:17,220
doesn't give a shit if you're taking like, like, nevermind. I was gonna say taking a shit next to

213
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:23,160
them, but they would probably really care about that. This guy does. This guy would freak out

214
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:31,640
and would, would be all over you. None of these care if you, of your existence. Earwigs, ants,

215
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,720
they just kind of do their own thing. They, these are in your business all the time.

216
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:41,509
They're the worst insect besides like a tick and a mosquito, which if they're on here, they're

217
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:51,140
getting put an F. Here they are. F. What purpose does a mosquito serve besides to just be annoying

218
00:30:51,140 --> 00:31:01,799
to every single other species on earth? I don't know what this is, but it looks cool. Yeah, I,

219
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:07,910
okay, am I weird for saying this? Little fruit flies, I hate them and I can't stand being near

220
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:12,390
them. But if this thing is like three or four inches long and walks across my floor,

221
00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:20,220
I'm not going to freak out. I'm going to go, whoa, that's awesome. That's so cool. And I'm going to

222
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:28,019
put an old piece of mail down so they can get on it. And I'm going to slowly help them get back

223
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:36,700
outside. And it's going to be a story. It's going to be this weird storyline that I make up. Oh,

224
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:49,420
I'm like, I helped these things. You know what I mean? What do you mean? Yeah, you guys don't do

225
00:31:49,420 --> 00:32:07,750
that. Based bug saver. I don't know what this is, but it's cooler than a than a scorpion. What is

226
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:14,839
that? This looks like this guy's wearing a Halloween costume. This looks like something you would find

227
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:24,970
in the aisle at Target. Like it shoots discs out of it or something. What is this? What is that?

228
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:33,740
Is it a cicada cicada cicada? Wait, are these the things that make the like emergency broadcast

229
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:51,480
sound? Yeah. F. What is that? I don't know what that is. But it looks it looks kind of weird.

230
00:32:52,119 --> 00:33:01,450
I don't know. This thing is cool. This thing's got a cool giraffe neck. It's going to be

231
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:10,569
be like a scarab. I actually don't really like grasshoppers. They freak me out. They can move

232
00:33:10,569 --> 00:33:16,980
too quickly. I mean, they're too erratic. Grasshoppers and locusts are in the same category for me

233
00:33:17,859 --> 00:33:26,740
because, okay, you know, you know, those toys that you press them in and you put them on the ground.

234
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:30,579
They're a little circle. They're like a little like a dollop. They're like this big and you it's

235
00:33:30,579 --> 00:33:34,980
made of like silicone or plastic or whatever. And you push the middle and you leave it on the ground

236
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:40,950
and then after a little bit it pop and it just kind of just goes in a random direction. That's

237
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:46,599
what those things do. Yeah, you like flip them upside down. You press them in flip them upside

238
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:51,240
down and put them flat and they a grasshopper will just be sitting there and all of a sudden

239
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,920
will just pop in a direction and it's just blah. I don't know where they're going. That's why I

240
00:33:54,920 --> 00:34:02,779
don't like them. This thing's kind of gross. I don't know what it is. This is a big beetle. Cool.

241
00:34:03,829 --> 00:34:11,380
I'll fix this. Don't worry. This is a hermit crab. It's comedy list. Is this a honeybee?

242
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,239
Because if it's a honeybee, it's probably the best.

243
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:29,940
Even just the, you know, it's so kind of annoying about doing this list and we kind of get to see

244
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:38,789
our own bullshit. The difference between this and this is really nothing at all. The difference

245
00:34:38,789 --> 00:34:44,780
between this and this is just the way that it looks, right? It's really not that different.

246
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:52,489
It's it's a bug and it looks pretty similar. But man, I know that these things are kind of vicious

247
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:59,030
and they're horrible or whatever, right? But I, my reaction to this is, oh, look at, he's got a

248
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:06,340
cute little face. My reaction to this is get it the fuck away from me and remove it from every

249
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:21,719
city on earth, right? It's kind of, it's crazy, right? This one's just like cute and does nice

250
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:25,400
things for the environment. That's why we like it. And this one's, I think this thing's just to kill

251
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:35,400
stuff. Yeah, there's a reason why we hate these. This is like a fly that somebody's stepped on

252
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:49,539
already. What, this is just a version of this that got like stepped on. What is that? It's a

253
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:58,699
horse fly. Get out of here. What is this little thing? Look at this guy. Look how cute that is.

254
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:09,000
What is that thing? It's A. This is not a bug. This is not a bug. It's a shrimp. Ladybug up here,

255
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:26,860
at least at A. I'll figure it out. This is just a squeeze of black paint. This is, this is acrylic

256
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:35,239
paint. This is not, what is this? This is not even an animal. It's a leech F. This is some kind of

257
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:52,250
weird tick or something F. This is cool looking. Oh yeah, the mantis. Explain this to me though.

258
00:36:52,980 --> 00:37:02,150
This is another thing that I don't understand. This insect is a murderer, is a cannibal, kills

259
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:12,360
everything, is incredibly dangerous. But we all go, yay, yes, yay. This is a killer. It's incredibly

260
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:25,849
dangerous. They're mean and we all go, ew, no, boo. Why? If you put your finger near this thing,

261
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:29,929
it's going to grab you with its spike hands and it's going to try to eat your hand and it hates you.

262
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:45,179
They do similar kind of things. The mantises don't hurt me. They need to make a Pixar movie

263
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:54,010
about this one and then maybe people won't hate it anymore. What would that even be? Aren't these

264
00:37:54,010 --> 00:38:03,909
called murder hornets? Disney Pixar Presents Murder Hornet. And it's just him like just sticking like

265
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:17,050
ass first through somebody's head. Well, how would you even make that movie? Nevermind. F, gross,

266
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:24,699
gross. Yep, F all the way at the bottom. Okay, this is one of the, this is the type of moth

267
00:38:24,699 --> 00:38:31,500
that everybody says they hate, right? Which I agree, they're kind of like, yeah, I'd put them

268
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:37,019
in the same category as this. I put them higher than, no. We'll think about it, right?

269
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:47,909
My reaction to seeing a moth like this is, oh, oh crap. Oh, moth got in, right? You don't care.

270
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:55,940
My reaction to seeing this is, what do we do about that? Right? Like you kind of don't care

271
00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:01,190
if this is in your house. I've seen at some point like three of these just kind of floating around

272
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:08,090
and I'm just like, oh, whatever. I don't care. So it's definitely probably higher than, I just

273
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:22,920
genuinely don't. I'm just indifferent to them. What a filthy house. Filthy. Because a couple of

274
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:30,949
moths were in the house one time. Guys, I remember I stayed over a relative's house one time. It was

275
00:39:30,949 --> 00:39:39,960
a long time ago and they had this place up kind of in like the woods and I'm not kidding. It was,

276
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:47,880
they were probably, if you just were lying in bed and looking up the ceiling and just guessing if

277
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,800
whether or not the like the dozens of like kind of specks that were on the ceiling and the dozens

278
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:57,960
of little things that were on the walls, if they were bugs or just marks and it turned out all of

279
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:04,010
them were bugs. I remember seeing just like just shadows just floating. You know, you can see the

280
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:10,920
shadow sometimes. You just see it kind of pass by the light. Just, so when you're in a situation

281
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:19,880
like that, I put, you put your head under the covers and you try to get a full night's sleep

282
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:27,530
by being completely protected by the, by the covers. But you got to be, you have to give yourself

283
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:34,380
like kind of like a hole for your mouth to like, but then you start to have the panic attack where

284
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:38,699
you go, wait, this is the only entryway to me and it's in my mouth and they're all going to fly in

285
00:40:38,699 --> 00:40:42,889
my mouth and I'm going to eat them. I'm going to be like, I'm going to, I'm going to wake up tomorrow

286
00:40:42,889 --> 00:40:53,059
morning and there's going to be like seven like dead bugs in my mouth. I still do this every time

287
00:40:53,059 --> 00:41:01,030
before I go to sleep. I just check kind of every corner. I'm just like, okay. I like shake the

288
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:07,019
blankets a couple of times. All right. Where are you? Anything here? Turn the lights off.

289
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:19,130
Turn the lights on. Oh, no. Okay. You check. Look at this little guy. What is that thing? What's this

290
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:42,409
like pistachio bug? Oh, this is cool. That's a stag beetle. That's a stag beetle. What was this

291
00:41:42,409 --> 00:41:58,070
one again? S tier? Well, hold on. I, this is, this is, this list is not correct, but let me get

292
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:04,699
everything up there first. Um, I don't really know what this thing is, but it kind of looks weird.

293
00:42:04,699 --> 00:42:15,380
Oh, look at this guy. This one has a chrome finish. It's cool. This is a shrimp. Oh,

294
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:22,679
fuck these things. These are the things that are underneath a box in your garage. Get rid of these

295
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:38,889
slug. Is a slug a bug? I thought slugs are not a bug. Are they? Are they a bug? I don't think of

296
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:49,420
insect when I think of a slug. They're cool though. Slugs are cool because they kind of look up and

297
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:59,989
they, they, their antennas are like, anytime you, if you go near, they kind of do this. They go like,

298
00:42:59,989 --> 00:43:09,289
they look around. They're cool. They're mollusks. Yeah, they're not really a bug, are they? They're

299
00:43:09,289 --> 00:43:24,710
cool though. Snail. A snail is, a snail is just like an armored slug. Do these go in comedy?

300
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:35,610
It's a crab. This is just literally me in a Spider-Man costume. This is just, this is the

301
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:45,780
Spider-Man symbol. It's not even, this is not even a physical object. Oh, dude, bite beetle,

302
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:56,440
whatever this is called. I don't know. I don't, I don't like that one. This is, this is in every

303
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:05,769
Nintendo game, first party. I don't know whatever it is. It's, it's like C. All right, the list is

304
00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:14,519
getting a little big here. Just another butterfly that can go back, that can stay at S. This is a

305
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:42,889
worm. List is getting big. We gotta move this a little more. List is getting bigger. This soundtrack

306
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:55,059
really is good, isn't it? Okay, so now this is a worm. Oh, but worms aren't bugs. You can't

307
00:44:55,059 --> 00:45:10,300
hear the soundtrack. You can. Worms aren't bugs either. What music? You can hear it. Quiet. Um,

308
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:19,460
this is a, the way, this is a parasite. What do you mean this is a parasite? What do you mean by

309
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:35,860
that? This is just a tapeworm. Oh, hey, this is a soapy jit. Thank you. And they are cool. You know

310
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:45,860
why? Because they eat the scorpions. These things eat the scorpions. It's a termite. Never mind.

311
00:45:46,659 --> 00:45:54,860
Oh, I wonder where I'm going to put Tick. What kind of sick mother fucker would put this here?

312
00:45:55,420 --> 00:46:00,699
You know what I'm saying? Oh, yeah, man. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,

313
00:46:00,699 --> 00:46:13,219
tick. Why would you put this here? Like, put the air guitar down, dude. Ticks suck. Why would this

314
00:46:13,219 --> 00:46:19,619
ever be higher than F? What? Why? You're making shit up. If you, if this, if you put this higher

315
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:27,159
than C, you're making it up. You're making it up to seem like harsh. You know what I'm saying?

316
00:46:28,039 --> 00:46:33,900
No one is ever going to put this in B. You're making it up. Stop making it up. Just, you don't

317
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:38,219
have to do that. This is, this is the word, one of the worst insects in the world. Everybody hates

318
00:46:38,219 --> 00:46:42,380
these things. Nobody likes this. You don't have to pretend to be like, oh yeah, I like that. It

319
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:48,059
sucks blood. Stop. You don't have to do that. Don't do that. Just put it in F with everybody else.

320
00:46:48,780 --> 00:47:01,099
Just put it down here with everybody else. No one's doing that. Yeah, I'm making up. It's called

321
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:14,230
a straw man argument. Go look it up. It's literally half my conversations. What is this? I don't know.

322
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:25,900
It's green and I like it. Wait, it's a flea? No, it's not. Don't some of these look like they're

323
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:31,099
taken from a certain perspective where this could be as big as a dog? Can you imagine?

324
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:51,579
This like freaks me out. Would that be better or worse? It would be a Jurassic period bug.

325
00:47:54,860 --> 00:48:04,099
Well, I mean like just for the environment, right? If bees were as big as a small house cat,

326
00:48:04,099 --> 00:48:09,980
would that be better for the environment? Would that be worse? It would be much worse.

327
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:23,480
It'd be worse for us. But what's, okay, like an earthworm, right? Where's the earthworm?

328
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:31,159
The good old earthworm. If these were as big as like a gas pipeline, right? If they were huge,

329
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:40,889
like tremor style, would that be better or worse for the world? If these were huge, but they weren't

330
00:48:40,889 --> 00:48:46,280
gonna hurt anybody. All right. No, no, no. Forget about if they were as big as like a whole like

331
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:52,920
pipeline or something. If they, if an earthworm was as big as a house cat or like as big as a dog

332
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:57,690
and as like like a snake, if they were as big as like a python, wouldn't that be better for the

333
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:04,059
soil? They would be kind of moving more soil, right? It's an earthworm. I'm not talking about

334
00:49:04,059 --> 00:49:20,869
like a scorpion. It would mess up foundations of houses. Yeah. I don't fucking know, Jerma. Just

335
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:27,340
rank them. You want me to be out of this, don't you? You're over this. You're done with this

336
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:34,519
segment. You don't want this segment anymore. At the end of the day, who cares, right? Does this

337
00:49:34,519 --> 00:49:43,449
really matter to anybody? Does it really matter where I put bugs on a tier list? This is meaningless.

338
00:49:43,449 --> 00:49:54,039
It's fucking meaningless. It's meaningless. I can understand like fast food restaurants and soft

339
00:49:54,039 --> 00:50:03,980
drinks and different cheeses, but bugs? Wow, I'm out of tier lists, huh? No more to do. This is it.

340
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:13,929
This is where we are now. I hate these things. Just the thought. Not, wait, not these ones. The

341
00:50:13,929 --> 00:50:22,699
ones that are under the water. You guys know the ones I'm talking about? The ones that dive? Oh,

342
00:50:22,699 --> 00:50:35,179
those are so gross. What are the ones that dive called? The ones that you can in pools across

343
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:41,719
America. They're shaped like a little oval and they have two legs that just go like this.

344
00:50:43,989 --> 00:50:50,150
Ah, God. I remember being in a pool and just having the goggles on and just jumping in the pool

345
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:57,530
and just going face to face with one of these little aliens just swimming underground or under

346
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:11,909
the water. They were, oh, I just hated it. This is a walrus. This is not, that's a walrus. What's

347
00:51:11,909 --> 00:51:21,780
this next one? This is a cartoon. This is, I don't know what that is. This is a crab. No,

348
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:30,280
this is one of those Australian spiders, which, yeah, no, fuck that. This is half a picture of

349
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:36,360
something. I don't know what that is. And this is, I don't like that. This is, this is the thing

350
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:42,489
that like kids put on the end of their pencils where the eraser is. This is just an eraser toy

351
00:51:42,489 --> 00:51:56,150
thing. This is not even an animal. All right, let me fix this. Where's the music? This is not

352
00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:14,710
the music I wanted. I can't connect. Kirby 64, the crystal shards. That's fine. Whatever.

353
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:27,980
It's a fuzzy caterpillar. That's kind of cute. It's not, it's probably the seat here. All right,

354
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:37,159
let me, let me start from the top here. Okay. So, honeybee. That's probably the best. Firefly.

355
00:52:37,159 --> 00:52:42,409
These are probably the best. I'm okay with this. I'm okay with this. Praying mantises are really

356
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:47,480
cool though. Then those of you that remember Cromwell was the praying mantis that was with

357
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:53,429
the hanging out with the sunflowers. Dung beetles are cooler than butterflies. Lady bugs are cooler

358
00:52:53,429 --> 00:53:00,579
than butterflies. In fact, butterflies are going to go down at A because, I mean, they're cool,

359
00:53:00,579 --> 00:53:10,619
but they're just, they're like the, they're like the vanilla ice cream of the bug world.

360
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:14,940
It's just, yeah, vanilla ice cream's fine. They're cool and it tastes good and I would, I would,

361
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:20,420
it would be fine. But I don't, it's like, it's cool, but it's just kind of just generic in a way.

362
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:25,239
It's great, but there are many other things that I think are more interesting than butterflies.

363
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:31,400
They're just generically great. Generally good. Forget about what I said about taste. I'm just

364
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:43,289
talking about just making a comparison. Would I rather have an earwig or a slug in my house?

365
00:53:43,289 --> 00:53:53,030
I really don't mind these. They have such a cute face. If you, okay, if you've never seen

366
00:53:53,030 --> 00:54:12,949
the face of an earwig, get out of my Discord call, whoever you are. Um, what was that? Okay.

367
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:25,079
Uh, they have a cute face and they look at you. They look up and they're like,

368
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:32,780
hello, it's me, earwig. They're, everyone hates earwigs. Earwigs literally crawl into your brain

369
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:40,219
through your ear. That is horseshit. It's not real. That's just somebody from like the fucking

370
00:54:40,219 --> 00:54:46,059
1400s made that up for one day because they, I don't know what they were doing. No, that doesn't

371
00:54:46,059 --> 00:54:52,539
happen. They used to say that happened back when the, like the queen ruled the earth. Okay.

372
00:54:53,929 --> 00:55:07,739
That this is not real. This doesn't happen to people. I feel like just fucking get up and

373
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:11,099
spinning with this one going. This is too much. I have to like blow the volume.

374
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:19,449
Alternate history, Andy. Okay. This nobody has an earwig in their ear. It's just called earwig

375
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:27,860
because some somebody like a fucking thousand years ago was, I don't know, just maybe they had

376
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:33,179
one in their ear. Who knows what they were putting in their ears at the time. You're talking about

377
00:55:33,179 --> 00:55:39,579
like the fucking 1500s, 1600s. They were probably putting like fucking the ground beef in their

378
00:55:39,579 --> 00:55:46,179
ears to cure the common cold. Of course a bug is going to go in their ear. They were probably

379
00:55:46,179 --> 00:55:52,659
putting like a delicious succulent honey in both of their ears to prevent coughing. You know, come

380
00:55:52,659 --> 00:56:10,280
on. I don't buy that. So is it any surprise? All right. This day and up there. Okay. I really

381
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,800
actually wouldn't want to see an aunt in my house because that means that you have aunts

382
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:18,150
and they follow that. If there's a bunch of them, I don't, you know what I mean? It's like, okay,

383
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:20,789
then I got to, I got to take care of this. I have to be, I have to be like, what am I,

384
00:56:20,789 --> 00:56:25,210
what do I do about this? You don't want, I don't mind ants. I think they're cute,

385
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:31,340
but you don't want ants. Seeing one aunt, two aunts like, oh, okay. Look at ant. But once you

386
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:39,480
turn the corner and there's like 10, you're like, okay, this is a problem. This turned into a

387
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:46,949
problem. But what about ant man? Don't worry. We'll get to that. Don't worry. We'll get to that.

388
00:56:51,289 --> 00:57:03,210
By the way, how is there not a single spider on this whole list besides the jokes? There's no

389
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:18,230
spider on this list. That's weird. Um, okay. All right. So let's, let's continue. That's fine.

390
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:29,059
This is fine. Um, do I really like these this much? Not really. I would probably rather see

391
00:57:29,059 --> 00:57:33,860
these in the house than any of these. I mean, come on. It's beautiful. Why would you be upset

392
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:53,219
about that? This is, a lot of these are changing here. What is this? No, you got, I'm not going to

393
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:58,340
put this up here just because you, you see it's cute and it's in Pokemon. I'm not putting it up

394
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:23,300
here. These things suck. There's a lot of Fs. You ever have that moment when you're looking at a bug

395
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:30,550
because the hardest part with this, especially with any insect, there are like 400 billion different

396
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:37,480
types of insects of the same genes and shit, right? So I'll look at a bug and I'll be like,

397
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:44,869
oh, cool. Look at this little beetle. Look at how cute. Wait, is there a raid? Oh, there is a raid

398
00:58:44,869 --> 00:58:53,179
from Cottontail. Cottontail VA. Thanks for the raid. Welcome everybody. We're raiding bugs. What's

399
00:58:53,179 --> 00:59:01,050
up? Thanks for the raid. Hope you had a good stream. We're raiding bugs right now. And then

400
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:13,980
we're going to play multiverses. It's going to be fun. Ow. I can't do that unless I have like,

401
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:27,829
have had two coffees and I haven't had that yet. Okay, so let's go. What was I saying? Oh, right.

402
00:59:27,829 --> 00:59:33,590
Okay. So there's, there's like millions of different kinds of bugs and types of insects, right?

403
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:37,989
So if you see like a cute beetle, you don't, there's no way to know what the hell it even really

404
00:59:37,989 --> 00:59:43,369
actually is. It could be something really shitty. And you sit in there going, whoa, cool beetle.

405
00:59:43,369 --> 00:59:51,500
What is that? Does this thing have poison in it? And you'll get it wrong. Oh, that's definitely,

406
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:58,599
that's a, that's a, that's a carpenter bee or something, right? And it's just wrong. And it

407
00:59:58,599 --> 01:00:05,239
was a fucking moth and it stung you in the mouth. What? I have to turn this off. This is like making

408
01:00:05,239 --> 01:00:13,619
my brain all messed up. It's speech jamming me and making me say weird things. Okay. But you know

409
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:16,659
what I mean? Like you'll just get it wrong. And then you, oh, I'm going to rescue this bug. And

410
01:00:16,659 --> 01:00:21,699
it turns out, why'd you rescue that bug? It just ate all your plants and like killed 50 other bugs

411
01:00:21,699 --> 01:00:25,300
that were good bugs. And you did that. You could have, you know, you should have gotten rid of

412
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:33,369
that bug. It's so hard to tell. Like you might save this bug and go look it up online. It's like,

413
01:00:33,369 --> 01:00:40,619
oh yeah, by the way, if you see any of these, get rid of them immediately. They will breed and you'll

414
01:00:40,619 --> 01:00:46,300
have 50 million in your backyard within two, three days. And you're just like, okay, that was great.

415
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:50,380
I just was trying to be like a nice guy and like not been saved like my beetle friend.

416
01:00:53,960 --> 01:01:14,570
That's what earwigs do. Can you shut up, man? Do earwigs do that? Okay. So when I,

417
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:21,750
when I see an earwig and listen to this music, right? Imagine an earwig looking up at you and

418
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:30,659
he's like, and I'm like, oh, get the envelope, save him. And I get the envelope and I put it out,

419
01:01:30,659 --> 01:01:35,300
get him on the envelope and I put him outside. Am I just creating another 5,000 earwigs?

420
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:49,860
And then the next day it's like three that you see and you're like, oh, wow, cool. Let's save these

421
01:01:49,860 --> 01:02:02,219
three to the same fucking soundtrack. Oh, save us. 50 in your house. And they're all dancing in a

422
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:08,699
line doing one antenna, two antenna, one antenna, two antenna, top hat, top hat, top hat. It's like,

423
01:02:08,699 --> 01:02:13,260
well, 50 earwigs. Oh my God, they're so cute. Get the, get the envelope. They all start crawling

424
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:19,590
on it. You get them out, you save them, save the earwigs. And then it, you know, me lying down in

425
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:25,829
bed three days later and I'm drifting off to sleep. Ah, what a nice day that was today.

426
01:02:26,789 --> 01:02:32,489
And the second that I fall asleep and I go into REM, they can sense it. And 2,000 earwigs just

427
01:02:32,489 --> 01:02:39,449
make a trail up the bed and just go into my brain to this music. And they all going in, digging in,

428
01:02:39,449 --> 01:02:47,579
like eating pieces of my brain matter. And I'm just asleep. And this, and some of them are still

429
01:02:47,579 --> 01:02:53,260
dancing with the top hat. Is that what you think? Is that what you're saying is going to happen to

430
01:02:53,260 --> 01:03:14,010
me? Oh, because I saved the earwig. I didn't want to kill the earwig. That already happened.

431
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:26,900
Why do you think you're like this? I don't see an earwig in this room. I don't see, I don't,

432
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:38,230
there's no earwigs crawling over the lens of the camera. Do you see one? I don't see one.

433
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:49,260
It's because they're inside of you. All right, we're moving on. We're moving on. Next up,

434
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:53,579
we're going to do real quick. This is a, but here's my list. I think it's accurate.

435
01:03:56,090 --> 01:04:04,809
That's accurate. The next one is a bug movie tier list. I guess we're going to stay with this theme

436
01:04:04,809 --> 01:04:22,940
here for a little bit. This one won't take long and then we'll play multi-parties. Wow, why is

437
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:36,250
Pinocchio on this list? Oh, because Jiminy, because, oh, Cricket. Spider-Man is on the list.

438
01:04:41,019 --> 01:04:47,099
But that's, that doesn't make any sense. Spider-Man is not a spider. He's a guy with a suit on

439
01:04:47,099 --> 01:04:54,119
that was bit by a spider. Neither is Ant-Man. So these are both D. I'm sorry. This does not fit

440
01:04:54,119 --> 01:05:10,570
the criteria. It doesn't fit the criteria. Hold on. Oh, shit. Hold on a second. No, it doesn't. It

441
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:17,800
does not fit the criteria. It has to be a movie based on an insect where the main character is

442
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:31,820
potentially an insect. Insect, not guy in a suit and he calls himself an insect name, right? But

443
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:39,269
could you say that the spider that bites Spider-Man is essentially the character of Spider-Man? Ant-Man

444
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:44,869
is not an ant. He just calls himself Ant-Man because he can shrink and grow. That doesn't make

445
01:05:44,869 --> 01:05:50,260
any sense. All right. This is a bug's life. I haven't seen any, I haven't seen any of these

446
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:56,920
movies in probably 10 years. Ants, this movie is weird. Dune, I haven't seen Dune. Freaks,

447
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:01,989
I don't know what that is. Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, that's S. James and the Giant Peach,

448
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:13,639
I remember this being okay. Men in Black, S. Pinocchio, B. It's two different Spider-Man movies,

449
01:06:13,639 --> 01:06:23,559
three Spider-Man movies. Starship Troopers was crazy. Tremors, I haven't seen it in a long time.

450
01:06:23,559 --> 01:06:34,469
Turbo, Turbo to me almost feels like I know the movie existed, but it feels like a mobile game ad

451
01:06:34,469 --> 01:06:48,380
that I watched. Right? I don't have a memory of this. What movie is this? Is this Alien?

452
01:06:48,380 --> 01:07:09,269
What movie is this? The Fly? I mean Pinocchio, could I put Pinocchio here? It's just Pinocchio.

453
01:07:09,989 --> 01:07:18,329
This was the animated kind of stop-motion one, right? I just haven't seen any of these in so

454
01:07:18,329 --> 01:07:26,090
long. I really don't even care. B-movie. B-movie is like Morbius, guys. You only like the movie

455
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:34,329
because you saw Copypasta one time. This is not a good movie. This is not a good movie.

456
01:07:34,329 --> 01:07:38,250
You only like B-movie because somebody made a GIF of the whole movie and it plays in five seconds

457
01:07:39,179 --> 01:08:05,369
and it's funny and Jerry Seinfeld's in it. It's C. That's a bad take. No, it's not. It's just like a

458
01:08:05,369 --> 01:08:12,250
general animated movie with Jerry Seinfeld. I mean, sure, it's fine, but yeah, it's weird,

459
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:29,460
isn't it? It's the worst ever take. B-movie is actually good. I just remember them in a car,

460
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:34,859
like they were driving in like these cars going to work or something and that's when I fell asleep

461
01:08:34,859 --> 01:08:49,289
in the hotel room. I didn't watch this because I wanted to. I don't think anybody's ever seen

462
01:08:49,289 --> 01:09:04,739
this movie. It's not S. I'll put it B because that's funny. I mean, the Spider-Man movies are

463
01:09:04,739 --> 01:09:12,180
great, but it doesn't make any sense. Alien should be higher. This isn't Aliens. He said this is the

464
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:25,659
fly. That's not the fly. This is like, what is that? I can't read it. It's cut off. It's called,

465
01:09:25,659 --> 01:09:36,659
it's actually the fly. Men in Black has bugs? I mean, the main character, the main antagonist

466
01:09:36,659 --> 01:09:53,369
of Men in Black is a bug. He's the bug. He's an alien, but he's a bug alien. He's an alien bug.

467
01:09:53,369 --> 01:10:00,649
The main character in Spider-Man is not a spider. He's a superhero that got bit by a spider

468
01:10:01,899 --> 01:10:08,170
before. The movies aren't even about the spider. The movies are about Spider-Man

469
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:16,680
taking on crime and fighting people. He shoots webs. Not in these ones, not in the Sam Raimi ones.

470
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:22,779
Excuse me. He has a device on his arms, doesn't shoot webs out of his arms. Have you seen the

471
01:10:22,779 --> 01:10:57,609
movie? Oops. Which one's more accurate to the book? Okay, which one's more accurate to the book?

472
01:10:57,609 --> 01:11:09,050
The web coming out of his arm or the devices? Which one's more accurate to the book? The device

473
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:20,729
is more accurate to the book. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That doesn't mean anything. Yeah,

474
01:11:20,729 --> 01:11:26,460
it means he's not a spider. It means he's a guy that can shoot webs that he got made in a laboratory.

475
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:35,689
He's not a spider. He's a man that has abilities of a spider that also is supplemented by technology.

476
01:11:35,689 --> 01:11:51,350
Ant-Man uses ants. Where even is Ant-Man? He does? I don't... All right, who cares?

477
01:11:51,909 --> 01:12:07,189
Let's play multiverses. Who cares? He controls ants? He controls ants? I know he doesn't. He does

478
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:17,050
like quantum physics. When does he control ants in the movie? He controls ants. He does? I've seen

479
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:23,579
these movies before. Wait, so you're telling me that in the movie Ant-Man at some point goes like

480
01:12:23,579 --> 01:12:31,399
this and the millions of ants do his bidding? Have I just... Did I forget the whole movie?

481
01:12:33,130 --> 01:12:39,850
No, he doesn't fucking do that. He does not go like... No, you're... Sorry, guys. You're thinking

482
01:12:39,850 --> 01:12:46,939
of... What was that movie with the guy that controlled the rats? Willard? You're thinking

483
01:12:46,939 --> 01:13:02,310
of Willard? That happened... That's a different movie. He rides an ant. What? Did I forget this

484
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:32,789
whole movie? No fucking way. Ant-Man trailer. No way. I don't believe it. Why is it so

485
01:13:32,789 --> 01:13:51,899
weirdly shaped? Where are the ants? There's no ants!

486
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:07,270
Okay, hold on.

487
01:14:13,909 --> 01:14:16,390
Did I not watch this one? Did I only watch the sequel?

488
01:14:19,350 --> 01:14:21,670
I don't remember him breaking into places and stealing stuff.

489
01:14:27,819 --> 01:14:39,430
I never watched this one. I only watched the sequel. I never watched this movie.

490
01:14:45,210 --> 01:14:51,050
What the fuck, dude? I never watched this movie. I've never seen this movie. I've never seen this

491
01:14:51,050 --> 01:14:58,729
movie. Holy shit, I was so wrong. Oh my god, I was wrong. He controls ants. He's Ant-Man. Of course

492
01:14:58,729 --> 01:15:24,659
he is. Oh my goodness. Wow, I just pretended to watch this one. Okay, but hold on a minute.

493
01:15:25,909 --> 01:15:31,989
Hold on a second, guys. They made all these... The ants was such a big deal in the first movie.

494
01:15:33,109 --> 01:15:40,090
Why were there no ants in the second movie? Why were there no ants in the second movie?

495
01:15:42,939 --> 01:15:47,590
No, there's no ants in the second movie. There are no ants I've seen in the second movie.

496
01:15:47,670 --> 01:15:56,710
They like go into like the quantum realm and who's... What even happens in the second movie?

497
01:15:56,710 --> 01:16:12,090
I don't... Whatever. I don't care. An ant plays the drums in the second movie.

498
01:16:12,090 --> 01:16:20,710
All right, give me two seconds. We're gonna play multiverses. I'm excited. I am very ready. Are

499
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:35,960
you guys ready for me to go nuts in multiverses? I am. You're literally insane. I'm sorry. I just

500
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:40,600
did not see the first movie and I thought I did. I have this distinct dream where I've seen it

501
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:48,699
already. I don't know why. I have this insane dream world.
