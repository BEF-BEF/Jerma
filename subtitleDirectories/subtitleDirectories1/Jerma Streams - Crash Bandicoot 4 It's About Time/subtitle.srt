1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:14,519
Late. No, no, no. I'm not late. I'm contractually obligated to be here!

2
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,440
Holy shit. What? That sounded weird.

3
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,100
That was like... I don't know what that... I don't know.

4
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:33,219
My, like, throat just took that and blended it up into a bunch of liquid.

5
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,500
I don't know what that was. I'm sorry.

6
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:44,659
Anyways, hi. Got a lot of stuff going on this weekend.

7
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,590
I'm not even supposed to be here right now.

8
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:54,359
Usually the intro screen is there for two, three minutes.

9
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,079
I was just ready.

10
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:03,990
Yeah, we're going to be live for three days in a row.

11
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,069
We got today, tomorrow, and Saturday.

12
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:14,840
Lots of games to play, including, of course, Gotham Knights.

13
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,379
Sponsored to play Gotham Knights.

14
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,870
Then this is an Omega sponsor because it's three days in a row.

15
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:31,659
But, but Gotham Knights is only going to be for a couple hours a day.

16
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:38,180
And I'm going to be here for at least five to seven hours each day.

17
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,500
We got a lot of shit to play.

18
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,680
Omega gaming weekend.

19
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,599
We want Scorn. I beat Scorn.

20
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,799
I literally beat Scorn three days ago.

21
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:58,939
Do it again.

22
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,060
There's not even a second ending.

23
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,579
By the way, okay, let me tell you about Scorn.

24
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,879
I sat down and after an evening and after sleeping on it,

25
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:14,979
I kind of realized how much I liked that game.

26
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,639
I really liked it.

27
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,680
It was, I don't know, it stuck with me for a little while.

28
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:25,879
It was just like, whoa, that game was weird.

29
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,639
It stuck with me for a little while.

30
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:35,219
It did play the sound.

31
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:36,259
I actually still have it.

32
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,610
It's still saved here.

33
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,569
That's so stupid.

34
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,939
But yeah, so you probably saw the title playing Crash Bandicoot 4.

35
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:52,979
It's about time.

36
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,819
I have, well, the title already says it.

37
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,699
I've never played Crash Bandicoot.

38
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:04,860
I don't have, I probably have like maybe 40 minutes total across the whole franchise

39
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,020
across various demo discs.

40
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:13,210
So we're starting with, in the middle of the Star Wars franchise.

41
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:22,120
Have you played it?

42
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,560
Have you played Uncharted?

43
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,849
No, no, I've never played Uncharted.

44
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:33,610
I don't even know what, honestly, I don't even know what that game is.

45
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:40,699
I know that Uncharted is about a guy that runs around getting treasure.

46
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:43,340
And then sometimes when something bad happens, he goes,

47
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,539
oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

48
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:46,939
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

49
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:47,900
That's it.

50
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,340
I don't know anything about, I don't have nothing.

51
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,060
I don't know anything else.

52
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:56,819
Should I play Uncharted?

53
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:57,460
Should I just do it?

54
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,780
Is it fun?

55
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,419
Is it a good game?

56
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,180
Is the Uncharted series a good franchise?

57
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,710
And do a poll.

58
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,909
I want it to be at least, it's not 80% at least I won't play it.

59
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:21,699
Is Uncharted a great franchise?

60
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:26,709
I want to see a poll.

61
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:31,740
And if it's over 80%, I'll play it.

62
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,670
Okay.

63
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,430
And I didn't say good, I say great.

64
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,300
Great franchise.

65
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:52,920
Okay.

66
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,420
Whoa.

67
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,829
Oh, no.

68
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,589
This is not what I expected.

69
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,910
I thought everybody loved this franchise.

70
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:01,939
Really?

71
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:02,899
That seems pretty high.

72
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:11,189
40, 50%.

73
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,420
What?

74
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,769
The later games are much more enjoyable.

75
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,740
It's good, but it's not great.

76
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:31,319
Are we going under 50% here for is it a great franchise?

77
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,139
Okay.

78
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:43,269
Well, I guess maybe I'll pass on it.

79
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,589
Maybe one day I'll play it for fun.

80
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,759
All right, let's get started.

81
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,240
Let's go.

82
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,040
We're playing.

83
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,759
We got like six or seven games to play this weekend.

84
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,420
And of course, Gotham Knights.

85
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,970
But that's not right now.

86
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:02,329
We'll do that later.

87
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:05,560
The way that this is going to be sectioned off is

88
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:10,360
for like the first two, three hours, maybe first few hours,

89
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,160
we'll play some stuff.

90
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,160
And the stream will always end with Gotham Knights.

91
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,160
That'll be like the second half of each stream.

92
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:21,019
I'm ready to play Crash Band.

93
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:22,379
Am I going to like this game?

94
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:24,379
How do you even play Crash Bandicoot?

95
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:26,470
It's like an RTS or something.

96
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,709
Imagine if he thought that.

97
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,589
You jump and run.

98
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:43,910
Okay.

99
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:44,870
This is kind of loud.

100
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:49,500
It's loud for me.

101
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:51,699
It's a little better.

102
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:52,180
All right.

103
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,540
Crash Bandicoot 4.

104
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,500
It's about time.

105
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,430
Oh, cutscene.

106
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,300
You look like 20 today.

107
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:03,860
24.

108
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,689
Let's go shaved.

109
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:06,189
Quiet.

110
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:08,420
Crash Band.

111
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,490
At last.

112
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,290
I, the great Neo Cortex.

113
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,660
Have you right where I want you.

114
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,740
And now the final blow.

115
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,560
Is Jimmy Neutron this guy's origin story?

116
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,240
Hush, simpleton.

117
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,040
Is it what he turned into?

118
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,620
Face it, entropy.

119
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,779
It's going to fail again.

120
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,740
At least Uka Uka and I attempt to free us from this prison.

121
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,620
I won't sit idly by and listen to your inane ramblings for another decade.

122
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:58,089
Whoa.

123
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:13,110
That guy's design is crazy.

124
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,910
Little clocks.

125
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:24,089
I feel like I should.

126
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:25,290
I'm not allowed to play this game.

127
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:44,409
Crash.

128
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:49,220
Like I have to put my save file from the first three games.

129
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,500
Otherwise, I'm not a real fan.

130
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:55,139
All right.

131
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:55,700
How do I play?

132
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,220
Fluid.

133
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:01,860
It's fluid.

134
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,529
I got to warn you.

135
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:06,889
I'm in a fucked up mood today.

136
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,059
But damn, I'm in a fucked up mood.

137
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,840
I got to get this out before the sponsor portion.

138
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:15,620
I got to get this out before the sponsor portion.

139
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,820
You know what I'm saying?

140
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,200
Okay, cool.

141
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,860
Dude, can I play the first three games on this?

142
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:32,419
Dude, you get apples, right?

143
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:38,970
Is there a double jump?

144
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:39,450
There is.

145
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:39,850
All right.

146
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:45,940
Oh, Joe HUD.

147
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:47,210
Okay.

148
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:48,330
Is this okay?

149
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,129
Is this a remake?

150
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:53,100
Or is this a brand new experience?

151
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,259
New game, original game.

152
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:01,059
All right.

153
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,940
This is kind of fun.

154
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:12,899
I remember this style of level being in the demo disc.

155
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,500
We must go.

156
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:27,830
They actually have a good shadow in this one.

157
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,710
They have pretty clean looking.

158
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,110
You're right.

159
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,690
Okay.

160
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,769
She shields me from damage.

161
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:39,289
You can take one hit, right?

162
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:40,330
You die in one hit in this game.

163
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,080
Oh, my God.

164
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:46,889
Wait, can I?

165
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,539
This is parry.

166
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:57,019
I'm biting my whole mouth off.

167
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:00,759
I don't know why I do this.

168
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,289
So just run.

169
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:06,259
What happened?

170
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:07,139
Oh, that was TNT.

171
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,919
All right.

172
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:09,879
That's Crash Bandicoot 4.

173
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:10,360
That was fun.

174
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,039
It's pretty good.

175
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:15,799
I'd say you should give it a try if you like it.

176
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:23,639
Are they bosses?

177
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:33,029
Will it blow up?

178
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:40,820
All right.

179
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,220
I get it.

180
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:47,990
Didn't they make like five racing games?

181
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:54,309
Yeah, I'm not playing on the retro mode.

182
00:11:54,309 --> 00:11:55,509
I'm playing on the modern mode.

183
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:55,990
Is that bad?

184
00:11:56,789 --> 00:12:01,110
Oh, shit.

185
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:21,179
This fluid checkpoint.

186
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:21,820
Cool.

187
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,509
Did you have two shields?

188
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:30,330
No, why would I play this scorned sound effect right now?

189
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:39,399
Oh, I can crawl.

190
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:39,639
Okay.

191
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,480
Ooh, all right.

192
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,899
I feel like this is a fun game to speed run.

193
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,970
Are you okay?

194
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:53,210
Yeah.

195
00:12:53,929 --> 00:12:55,720
Why are you asking that?

196
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,990
Bonus round?

197
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:03,990
Nice.

198
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,889
Oh, wait.

199
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:09,529
Let's go get it.

200
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:09,769
Okay.

201
00:13:10,409 --> 00:13:18,120
So how does this compare to the other ones?

202
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,159
Do you guys think it looks good?

203
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:27,720
How come you're not laughing hysterically at all the cartoon sound effects?

204
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:34,570
Why would I?

205
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:44,090
Bullshit.

206
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,240
Holy shit.

207
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,340
That's the only time I'm doing that for the whole night.

208
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:01,740
I promise.

209
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,139
Okay.

210
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:17,620
I will tell you I can not do that during Gotham nights.

211
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,259
Like, I can't.

212
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:20,580
I literally can't.

213
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,720
Like, I cannot look up at Gotham City,

214
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,360
at like the big sprawling city and all of a sudden you hear scorn.

215
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,679
That can't happen.

216
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:30,919
I genuinely think that I can't do that.

217
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,820
You have to.

218
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,779
I can't do that.

219
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,250
I'm missing four boxes?

220
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:49,019
You better remove that from your soundboard then.

221
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,779
Gems and skins?

222
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,860
Gems unlock skins.

223
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,220
Earn gems by breaking crates,

224
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,980
getting wumpa,

225
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,860
finding hidden gems,

226
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,460
and beating levels in three lives or less.

227
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:00,870
Okay.

228
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,950
All right.

229
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,200
That's kind of cool, I guess.

230
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:18,389
Is it just in-game currency?

231
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:20,149
I don't think you have to pay for anything.

232
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,539
Golden wumpa crates give 25 wumpa.

233
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:39,960
You didn't even tell me how to grab the fucking pole thing.

234
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,720
You didn't even tell me how to do it.

235
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,279
How do I do it?

236
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:42,840
How do I hold it?

237
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:51,899
I gave the whole jump.

238
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:52,460
Okay.

239
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,100
They didn't say that.

240
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:55,220
Where's my tutorial?

241
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,480
I don't know why I just tried to dodge.

242
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,519
There is a dodge roll.

243
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:01,080
Okay, there is.

244
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,350
You're too big of a streamer now?

245
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,149
Wait, what did the person say?

246
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,269
What did you say?

247
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,899
I know you're a big streamer.

248
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,019
Just don't forget your roots.

249
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,299
What do you mean?

250
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:32,659
You're gonna ban that guy?

251
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:33,379
No.

252
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:33,879
Why?

253
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:41,940
You need longer hair.

254
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,789
I'm gonna hit this, aren't I?

255
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:51,590
Oh, okay.

256
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,149
You've changed.

257
00:16:52,789 --> 00:16:53,269
I don't know.

258
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:54,149
I don't...

259
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:54,389
Okay.

260
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:55,509
I know everybody says this.

261
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:58,220
I don't think I have.

262
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,220
I feel like I have the same brain,

263
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,100
same thought process,

264
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,299
the same way I approach everything

265
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:06,150
since I was 25, 26.

266
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:09,109
I feel like I haven't really done anything that different.

267
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,779
Maybe I have.

268
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,089
I don't know.

269
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:14,569
It's hard to tell.

270
00:17:23,269 --> 00:17:23,589
Whoa.

271
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,390
All right.

272
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:27,299
We're good.

273
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,220
Where's 2018 gerba?

274
00:17:29,779 --> 00:17:36,380
Did you just kill me?

275
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,940
All right.

276
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,099
What's that?

277
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,460
Can I jump over there?

278
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:48,059
I thought that was like a magical item.

279
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,460
That looks like a secret to me.

280
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,890
Grabbing that little rat thing.

281
00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:03,849
There's no iframes.

282
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:04,329
Okay.

283
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:05,450
I can't be losing in this game.

284
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:05,769
I just...

285
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:06,490
I physically can't.

286
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,490
If I die to this guy one more time,

287
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,490
I will do a scorn in Gotham Knights.

288
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:21,799
Thank God.

289
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:22,599
I physically...

290
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:23,640
I think that's literally not...

291
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,079
I think that's like the contract.

292
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:42,500
Okay.

293
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,299
All right.

294
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:45,779
The game got a lot harder in one tutorial level.

295
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:46,180
Hold on.

296
00:18:46,819 --> 00:18:52,329
Bonus.

297
00:18:52,329 --> 00:19:01,609
Cool.

298
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:06,819
While holding B, double jump.

299
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,049
Oh, it's like a Super Mario 2 Luigi jump.

300
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:11,690
That's kind of cool.

301
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:17,690
Oh, shit.

302
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,500
We're good.

303
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:26,519
We got it all.

304
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:31,829
12.

305
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:33,190
Oh, that's 12 right here, right?

306
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:35,160
Nice.

307
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,319
All right.

308
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:35,799
I got them all.

309
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:37,220
100%.

310
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:41,220
What game are you playing?

311
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,660
This is Crash Bandicoot 4.

312
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:56,819
Does this still count if I'm off screen?

313
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:03,910
All right.

314
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:04,309
I get it.

315
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:04,710
It wants you to...

316
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,720
Oh, my God.

317
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,680
I fucked it up.

318
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:44,500
Yes.

319
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:49,349
You listen to a Goo Goo Gaga game.

320
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,369
Super Mario 1 is one of the hardest games ever.

321
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:02,809
Sorry.

322
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:06,809
Crash Bandicoot PS1 is one of the hardest games of that generation.

323
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:15,799
Is this your fursona?

324
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,220
I mean, no, but it's kind of cool.

325
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:26,250
I don't know.

326
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,450
Is it a bandicoot?

327
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:32,089
What even is a bandicoot?

328
00:21:32,089 --> 00:21:38,460
Cool.

329
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:54,069
I don't know.

330
00:21:54,069 --> 00:21:55,269
I made a movie with this guy.

331
00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:07,000
Can you see a 3D animated series?

332
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,210
TV series.

333
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,269
Oh, come on.

334
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:21,509
Two.

335
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:25,609
Two.

336
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:26,329
I missed two.

337
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:33,690
Can you please do the crash?

338
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,339
Whoa sound.

339
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:37,299
How does it go?

340
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:43,380
What does it sound like?

341
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:57,109
It goes, whoa.

342
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:57,509
Like that?

343
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:12,599
That's not even right.

344
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:20,710
I'll try it.

345
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,150
Whoa.

346
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,630
That kind of sounded like Luigi.

347
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:54,410
Time and space will be within our grasp.

348
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:55,690
Engine, embryo.

349
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:59,609
You had some little projects you wanted to tell me about?

350
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:05,130
Master, my mechanical marble will hypnotize you and I.

351
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:10,569
And my potion will make me and them unstoppable.

352
00:24:10,569 --> 00:24:11,690
Right, yeah, fine, sure.

353
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,569
Have fun with your ray guns or whatever.

354
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:18,890
Pacing your steps.

355
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:25,930
By my calculations, our enemies are already moving against us and we will prevail.

356
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:30,460
Cool.

357
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,910
I don't know what the sound effect is.

358
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,519
Welcome to the dimensional map.

359
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:43,720
Here you can select levels to play.

360
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,559
Switch between Crash and Coco.

361
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:48,519
Change skins and replay levels to take on time trials.

362
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:49,160
Time trials.

363
00:24:49,880 --> 00:25:00,599
Okay, all right.

364
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,049
This is the actual sound effect.

365
00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:05,690
All right, hold on.

366
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,440
Whoa, whoa.

367
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,140
That was not even that different than what I did.

368
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:23,849
That was not even that different than the thing I just did.

369
00:25:23,849 --> 00:25:28,230
Try it again.

370
00:25:29,349 --> 00:25:33,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

371
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,299
I win.

372
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:42,279
All right, B level to unlock time trial.

373
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:44,069
Should I try this?

374
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:47,079
Hold on.

375
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:49,700
Wait, did I unlock a skin?

376
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:54,569
How do I get this?

377
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:56,329
Unlock in Rude Awakening.

378
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:57,829
Oh, shit.

379
00:26:01,099 --> 00:26:02,619
There's so many skins.

380
00:26:06,259 --> 00:26:07,539
Digital download.

381
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:08,500
Oh, look at that.

382
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:12,859
Totally tubular.

383
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:21,400
Should I use this one?

384
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,250
Unlock in Insanity Peak.

385
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,950
I mean, it's Halloween.

386
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:31,910
I'm going to do...

387
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,950
Do they have the same moves?

388
00:26:35,589 --> 00:26:36,630
Are both characters the same moves?

389
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:40,099
Let's try.

390
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:52,619
They're exactly the same?

391
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:52,940
Okay.

392
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,380
It's cool.

393
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:37,049
Go!

394
00:27:37,849 --> 00:27:45,980
Wait, A's world?

395
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:50,259
Oh, this is kind of weird.

396
00:27:50,259 --> 00:27:50,579
All right.

397
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,180
The depth is hard to do here.

398
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:06,819
Hold on.

399
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:12,309
I want to try to get as many boxes as I can.

400
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:26,490
Shut up.

401
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,329
Oh, my fucking God.

402
00:28:28,329 --> 00:28:29,130
I'm never going to beat this.

403
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:08,539
Oh, my God.

404
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:09,420
Don't freak out.

405
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:09,900
Like, stop.

406
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,019
I don't like...

407
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:13,819
What's happening?

408
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:14,140
I don't...

409
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,740
I genuinely don't understand.

410
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,029
Is that jump way larger than I think it is?

411
00:29:19,829 --> 00:29:21,579
I'm going to lose to the second level.

412
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,960
Why is this jump five times bigger than I think it is?

413
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,140
That jump is huge.

414
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,180
Okay, that was the problem.

415
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:34,579
I'm good.

416
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:44,730
I like that sound.

417
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:53,769
Sorcery, sorcery, sorcery.

418
00:29:54,329 --> 00:29:57,589
What about it?

419
00:29:57,589 --> 00:29:58,470
I should play it?

420
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,029
Yeah, I will.

421
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:09,420
One, two...

422
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,690
Oh, I missed dialogue.

423
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,009
Shit.

424
00:30:14,809 --> 00:30:23,579
Don't kill me, please.

425
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,809
Nitro crates explode on touch.

426
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:30,019
Is that a bad thing?

427
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,859
That's a bad thing, right?

428
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:33,940
How do I do this?

429
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,660
Is this a bad thing?

430
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:41,779
But do I...

431
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:42,500
Okay, I have a question.

432
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:45,059
Do I have to break those?

433
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:47,859
Does it count to my total crate count at the end?

434
00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:54,250
No.

435
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,259
It's not that complicated.

436
00:30:58,009 --> 00:31:01,640
I'm just asking a very simple question.

437
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,000
Okay, no health.

438
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:06,440
This game came out in like 1994.

439
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,400
What do you mean no health?

440
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,920
Well, this one came out like yesterday or today, whatever it was.

441
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,259
Those...

442
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:20,500
All right, so don't touch these.

443
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,430
Oh, relax.

444
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:32,500
I have to break them all.

445
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:39,240
I'm just going to go with the fact and assume that I don't.

446
00:31:43,049 --> 00:31:43,549
No.

447
00:31:44,089 --> 00:31:51,369
Okay, so there is a butt drop.

448
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:52,650
I did it before.

449
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:01,720
Hang.

450
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:06,599
Oh, missed a box.

451
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:22,819
I got a golden pear.

452
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:29,049
You missed two.

453
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:29,529
Whatever.

454
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:35,000
This is not 100% playthrough.

455
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,019
This is a kind of sort of playthrough.

456
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,009
Go back.

457
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,259
I can't even go backwards.

458
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:51,910
Why?

459
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:53,430
I've banned that person.

460
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,029
Time that person off for 10 minutes.

461
00:32:55,029 --> 00:33:08,069
My god.

462
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,349
I'm so mad at that person.

463
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:17,880
No, and it ruined everything.

464
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,759
How many lives do I have?

465
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:28,259
Gotham Knights contract.

466
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,940
No scorn.

467
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:30,819
Sign here.

468
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,539
It's the baseball signature.

469
00:33:37,829 --> 00:33:38,470
That's pretty good.

470
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:43,579
I don't care if I get...

471
00:33:43,579 --> 00:33:43,980
Whatever.

472
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:06,150
Jesus.

473
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:15,110
Okay, move on, please.

474
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:18,820
Uh-oh.

475
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,329
I have a time limit.

476
00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:29,579
That's like walking on a Dark Souls banister.

477
00:34:44,059 --> 00:34:44,699
I like this level.

478
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:54,519
Oh, I thought that was a fucking button.

479
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:55,239
I'm so...

480
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,039
Don't start me back.

481
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,980
I like this game.

482
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,380
I like it.

483
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:26,860
It's tricky.

484
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:40,090
I like it.

485
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,050
It's tricky.

486
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:54,409
I like it.

487
00:35:54,409 --> 00:35:54,969
It's...

488
00:35:54,969 --> 00:35:56,170
I like it.

489
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:56,730
It's tricky.

490
00:35:57,369 --> 00:36:04,500
I gotta get all 22.

491
00:36:05,059 --> 00:36:10,090
Does that do?

492
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:12,889
Oh, it's...

493
00:36:12,889 --> 00:36:13,210
All right.

494
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,090
Let me calculate this.

495
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:19,909
All right.

496
00:36:19,909 --> 00:36:20,469
Calculated.

497
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:37,269
Shit.

498
00:36:37,269 --> 00:36:40,039
I thought that was...

499
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:40,440
All right.

500
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:45,500
So now I think it's gotta be this.

501
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:47,449
Yup.

502
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:53,639
Okay.

503
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:55,179
Thank you.

504
00:36:55,739 --> 00:36:59,269
That's them all.

505
00:36:59,269 --> 00:37:00,469
I got 22.

506
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:09,579
Pretty sick.

507
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,869
Oh, secret.

508
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,239
Get out of here.

509
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:47,820
Did I miss any behind me?

510
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,789
No, we're good.

511
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:57,079
Oh, my God.

512
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:57,559
It's gonna fall.

513
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:02,679
Why did I do that?

514
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:18,820
Dude, too loud.

515
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,380
Too one-up.

516
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,420
Okay.

517
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,139
So what did I...

518
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:37,619
Oh, okay.

519
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:37,860
I know.

520
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,059
I know what I did wrong last time.

521
00:38:59,579 --> 00:38:59,980
Okay.

522
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:03,400
Wait.

523
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,360
Wait a minute.

524
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,219
Excuse me.

525
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:07,940
What's under there?

526
00:39:08,659 --> 00:39:10,260
Nothing.

527
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,039
Okay.

528
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:15,429
I can't...

529
00:39:15,429 --> 00:39:34,010
How?

530
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:34,329
I can't...

531
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:39,400
It just told me to crawl.

532
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:48,090
Dude, there's a fucking invisible wall right there.

533
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:48,809
Did I skip Luigi?

534
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,210
There's an invisible wall.

535
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,010
I thought I had to jump up there.

536
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:52,329
All right.

537
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:54,250
Why hold B to crawl?

538
00:39:54,889 --> 00:39:56,460
I don't get this.

539
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,230
I actually just did that.

540
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:01,670
Whatever.

541
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,150
I don't care.

542
00:40:05,829 --> 00:40:06,630
I just...

543
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:10,980
I did the NG teleporter kill to myself.

544
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:19,030
All right.

545
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:19,670
How are we doing here?

546
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:23,429
Oh, my God.

547
00:40:23,429 --> 00:40:23,829
I didn't...

548
00:40:23,829 --> 00:40:24,630
I pressed the wrong button.

549
00:40:25,429 --> 00:40:34,039
I shouldn't crush them.

550
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:42,389
Wait.

551
00:40:50,090 --> 00:41:01,400
I like the level design.

552
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,119
It's actually really good.

553
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,960
The level design is actually good.

554
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:11,619
Sometimes they make a game like this and it like sucks.

555
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:12,019
You know what I mean?

556
00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:17,429
Come on.

557
00:41:17,429 --> 00:41:17,909
Get up there.

558
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:34,809
Damn it.

559
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:37,960
Okay.

560
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,199
Cool.

561
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,300
Let's don't fall off.

562
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:46,739
Destroys all nitro crates in this level.

563
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,820
146.

564
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,380
It's all right.

565
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:50,860
I'll take it.

566
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:56,329
I'll take it.

567
00:42:00,579 --> 00:42:04,630
My FPS dropping on my camera.

568
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:05,030
A little bit.

569
00:42:11,219 --> 00:42:12,579
Restart the level.

570
00:42:12,579 --> 00:42:23,239
Wait.

571
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:24,039
I can restart.

572
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:24,280
Wait.

573
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,739
Play level.

574
00:42:28,489 --> 00:42:29,289
Time to beat.

575
00:42:29,289 --> 00:42:32,010
Is that one hour and 39 minutes?

576
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:32,329
Wait.

577
00:42:32,329 --> 00:42:33,690
Do I actually fight against a ghost?

578
00:42:34,329 --> 00:42:41,909
Do you actually see the ghost on screen?

579
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:55,579
I did not beat this level in a minute and 39 seconds.

580
00:42:55,579 --> 00:43:01,769
This took me like 20 minutes.

581
00:43:02,409 --> 00:43:05,420
Do I get to...

582
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,219
Is it like a...

583
00:43:06,219 --> 00:43:06,380
Okay.

584
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:06,860
Here we go.

585
00:43:07,659 --> 00:43:09,300
Oh, let's go.

586
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:13,880
He's a fucking idiot.

587
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,320
He's going to fall like three times at this part.

588
00:43:17,059 --> 00:43:17,699
Hey, wait.

589
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:19,960
What the fuck?

590
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,059
That's not me.

591
00:43:29,059 --> 00:43:29,780
I didn't do that.

592
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:33,019
That's not even me.

593
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,559
It's a speed run.

594
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:39,000
Oh, I thought that was me.

595
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,880
I thought it was like a ghost thing like in Mario Kart.

596
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:54,579
All right.

597
00:43:54,579 --> 00:43:55,380
Let's go.

598
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,900
It's a speed run.

599
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,820
I thought I was racing against the ghost.

600
00:44:01,219 --> 00:44:02,420
In Mario Kart.

601
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,920
Stop referencing Mario.

602
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:11,210
It's the most celebrated video game franchise in human history.

603
00:44:11,769 --> 00:44:14,650
Guys, the cavemen even knew who the fuck Mario was.

604
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:15,050
It's...

605
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:17,050
You cannot not make Mario references.

606
00:44:17,769 --> 00:44:36,460
Okay, cool.

607
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:38,039
What else you got?

608
00:44:41,219 --> 00:44:42,420
I'll be very honest.

609
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:46,179
I really thought this was going to be kind of shit.

610
00:44:46,179 --> 00:44:47,539
I'm going to be just very upfront.

611
00:44:47,539 --> 00:44:48,820
I just didn't think I was going to care.

612
00:44:49,539 --> 00:44:52,739
I thought it was going to be like each one of these levels is kind of just...

613
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:57,860
Oh, it's like world 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 1-5.

614
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,380
And they're all like the exact same.

615
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:01,320
It's like no difference.

616
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,559
It's just kind of a slightly different level with different platforms.

617
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:06,039
But each one of these levels seems pretty different.

618
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:07,159
I like the design so far.

619
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,079
Game critic Andy.

620
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,219
I like the design.

621
00:45:11,219 --> 00:45:12,420
I like what they've done with this so far.

622
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,349
Like, what the fuck?

623
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:16,150
Who cares what I think?

624
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:17,030
I eat boogers.

625
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:17,829
Like, you know what I mean?

626
00:45:17,829 --> 00:45:19,110
Like, who cares what I say?

627
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:22,500
What is in here?

628
00:45:43,929 --> 00:45:44,489
Wait.

629
00:45:44,489 --> 00:45:45,610
Don't forget about the secrets.

630
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:48,940
Yeah, I got to get this out of me.

631
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,539
I have to get it out of my system.

632
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,699
I can't say I eat boogers on the sponsored part of the screen.

633
00:45:53,579 --> 00:46:01,369
I got hit?

634
00:46:01,369 --> 00:46:12,010
Who made this game?

635
00:46:12,969 --> 00:46:13,849
What's the company?

636
00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:14,570
Don't touch that.

637
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:14,969
Get back.

638
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:16,860
No, go back.

639
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:17,340
I want to go back.

640
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:17,739
I want to go back.

641
00:46:17,739 --> 00:46:18,059
Just die.

642
00:46:18,059 --> 00:46:18,699
How do I fall off?

643
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:20,550
How do you fall?

644
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:21,670
Okay.

645
00:46:22,389 --> 00:46:28,940
That's nothing.

646
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:29,820
I think I just lost the level.

647
00:46:32,809 --> 00:46:33,530
What is that then?

648
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:45,989
Whatever.

649
00:46:45,989 --> 00:46:46,789
Oh, shit.

650
00:46:46,789 --> 00:46:46,949
No.

651
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:48,070
Whatever.

652
00:46:52,489 --> 00:46:52,889
What's that?

653
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,320
What's that?

654
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:07,739
How do I even get that?

655
00:47:07,739 --> 00:47:16,570
How do I get that?

656
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:32,460
I keep missing it.

657
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,300
I don't know how to get that.

658
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:37,909
Oh, yes, I do.

659
00:47:38,949 --> 00:47:39,349
Stupid.

660
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:44,889
How do I get up?

661
00:47:44,889 --> 00:47:47,849
Oopsie.

662
00:47:47,849 --> 00:47:48,010
Okay.

663
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:48,889
Well, what did that do?

664
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:00,789
That's what it was.

665
00:48:01,429 --> 00:48:07,190
Is that what it was?

666
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:14,059
It's your favorite 2D platformer of all time.

667
00:48:14,699 --> 00:48:19,619
I really kind of don't like them that much.

668
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:23,380
I enjoy them, but not really enough to care that much to have a favorite.

669
00:48:32,969 --> 00:48:35,929
I enjoy them, but it's not like, oh, wow, my favorite.

670
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:41,719
Name some iconic platformers.

671
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:42,519
I'll tell you if I play them.

672
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:44,489
Mario.

673
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:44,730
Yeah.

674
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:46,730
But I mean, what's the easy question?

675
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,400
Celeste was really good.

676
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:51,800
Yep.

677
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,920
Celeste was very good.

678
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:54,539
It's probably up there.

679
00:49:01,349 --> 00:49:02,070
Doodle jump.

680
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:03,670
I never played it.

681
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:07,269
This is not timed, right?

682
00:49:07,269 --> 00:49:08,070
Yoshi's Island?

683
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,590
Yoshi's Island was pretty good.

684
00:49:10,309 --> 00:49:13,219
How do I tackle this?

685
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,300
How do I tackle this?

686
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:22,969
How do I tackle this?

687
00:49:22,969 --> 00:49:24,090
I don't know.

688
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:29,460
I definitely can turn this back on, right?

689
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,860
Let's see.

690
00:49:31,739 --> 00:49:32,699
Because I don't want to get rid of them.

691
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:45,349
There it is.

692
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:55,260
Oh, okay.

693
00:49:55,260 --> 00:50:02,889
Very cool.

694
00:50:02,889 --> 00:50:03,210
All right.

695
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:03,690
There we go.

696
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:04,329
All right.

697
00:50:04,329 --> 00:50:08,300
Number two, 20.

698
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,489
Where's the 24?

699
00:50:14,889 --> 00:50:15,690
Oh, my God.

700
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:16,329
I didn't leave one.

701
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:20,789
Oh, that sucks.

702
00:50:20,789 --> 00:50:21,429
What did I miss?

703
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,760
I have to leave at least one there.

704
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:37,699
There's one above here.

705
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:47,860
What happened?

706
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:48,820
Oh, my goodness.

707
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:49,619
I thought I jumped.

708
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,059
Something wrong with this dude.

709
00:50:52,860 --> 00:51:03,579
I love how hard it is.

710
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,730
It doesn't hold your hand.

711
00:51:07,369 --> 00:51:18,170
My favorite part is that it doesn't hold your hand.

712
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:19,860
Oh, there it is.

713
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:28,840
Left one.

714
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:29,800
There we go.

715
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,300
Okay.

716
00:51:53,269 --> 00:51:53,989
Don't miss.

717
00:51:54,469 --> 00:51:58,730
This thing can crush me, right?

718
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:02,170
It almost happened.

719
00:52:02,969 --> 00:52:07,769
I almost have a three.

720
00:52:07,769 --> 00:52:16,260
No, don't die.

721
00:52:18,659 --> 00:52:19,539
There's no checkpoint.

722
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:39,179
Why is that here?

723
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:42,019
There it is.

724
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:51,860
Okay.

725
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,340
Do I have 100% so far?

726
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:57,800
I think I do.

727
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:02,340
I think I have 100%.

728
00:53:10,699 --> 00:53:11,420
No, go back.

729
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:22,170
What the fuck just happened?

730
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:24,230
I thought that stuck out further.

731
00:53:40,579 --> 00:53:54,150
Okay, you have to do super jump.

732
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:55,829
Seriously.

733
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:57,429
The super jump.

734
00:53:57,429 --> 00:54:00,070
I was still pressing it so I ground pounded down.

735
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:15,380
Okay.

736
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,780
There we go.

737
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:19,059
All right, we're good.

738
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:35,210
Did I get everything?

739
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:38,760
I can't tell.

740
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,039
I actually really don't know.

741
00:54:40,039 --> 00:54:40,539
That way?

742
00:54:43,219 --> 00:54:44,019
Nothing touched me.

743
00:54:47,449 --> 00:54:48,250
Nothing touched me.

744
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,420
No, this is hurting my brain a little.

745
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:05,920
Okay.

746
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:12,550
Oh, shit.

747
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:13,190
Okay, I'm good.

748
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:15,610
No.

749
00:55:18,329 --> 00:55:18,969
What happened?

750
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:21,210
What does it hurt my butt?

751
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:43,460
Dude.

752
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:44,840
What?

753
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:48,230
Okay, we're good.

754
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:48,949
Nice.

755
00:55:48,949 --> 00:55:51,079
Is that it that's over here?

756
00:55:51,079 --> 00:55:52,039
I can jump on top of that.

757
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:54,119
All right.

758
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:55,000
Now what?

759
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,980
I'm just gonna go for it.

760
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:02,170
That was the dumbest fucking thing I've done in like a month.

761
00:56:02,969 --> 00:56:04,489
That was the dumbest thing I've done in like two months.

762
00:56:05,289 --> 00:56:10,940
Why did I do that?

763
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:15,639
I used to do that shit in Mario 3.

764
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,800
My Super Mario world, right?

765
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:21,800
You would like do the boing, boing, boing.

766
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,719
And you didn't even care where you were going.

767
00:56:23,719 --> 00:56:25,000
You just knew you were going right.

768
00:56:25,719 --> 00:56:44,659
I'm gonna, you gotta be, that doesn't make any sense.

769
00:56:44,659 --> 00:56:45,619
I can't feel it.

770
00:56:45,619 --> 00:56:47,300
You can't stop a ground pound, dude.

771
00:56:51,239 --> 00:56:53,000
Now I'm just, okay, I'm pissed right now.

772
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,360
It's B, B, okay.

773
00:56:55,159 --> 00:56:58,679
B is do big jump, but B is also ground pound.

774
00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:02,519
So I keep hitting like, okay, I'm gonna do a jump and I'm holding B

775
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:04,519
and I'm still holding B, but I accidentally touched it again.

776
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:16,250
Oh, a shitty craftsman blames his tools.

777
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:26,070
It's not hard at all.

778
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:26,789
I just can't do it.

779
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:36,179
Oh, wait.

780
00:57:36,179 --> 00:57:37,619
It's right bumper.

781
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:38,500
Oh, that's way better.

782
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,059
Okay, thank you.

783
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:48,179
Oh my God, I pressed.

784
00:57:48,179 --> 00:57:49,940
Okay, I swear to God, I'm not doing this on purpose.

785
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:51,619
I flipped it.

786
00:57:51,619 --> 00:57:57,340
Why is Switch, I swear to God, I'm not doing this for like funny.

787
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,900
Look at this like funny compilation of this fucking idiot.

788
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,579
They can't play Crash Bandicoot correctly.

789
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:07,659
Why is Switch, you know, whatever the spacing.

790
00:58:23,449 --> 00:58:26,039
Okay, come on, dude.

791
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:29,619
Should I go this way?

792
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:34,889
No, there's nothing over here.

793
00:58:35,369 --> 00:58:42,630
That's all that's over there.

794
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:44,230
That's it.

795
00:58:46,199 --> 00:58:48,840
All right, finally he made it.

796
00:58:51,099 --> 00:58:52,780
Oh, this is a bad run.

797
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:53,579
Anything down here?

798
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:56,820
I don't care.

799
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:57,219
Whatever.

800
00:58:57,219 --> 00:58:57,699
I'll take it.

801
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:05,900
Can I buy a skin?

802
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:10,820
I probably have enough to buy a skin.

803
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:17,289
Should I?

804
00:59:17,289 --> 00:59:22,230
Look at it.

805
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:23,590
Flashback tapes unlocked.

806
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:25,269
Rewind time back to the 90s.

807
00:59:25,829 --> 00:59:34,300
Play flashback tapes to experience Crash and Coco's training in Neo Cortex's test chambers.

808
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,179
What does that mean?

809
00:59:35,179 --> 00:59:42,340
Let's find out.

810
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:43,219
Unlocking.

811
00:59:43,219 --> 00:59:43,780
No, I can't.

812
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,920
All right, we'll go with this one.

813
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,199
Let's see.

814
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,199
Subject 218.

815
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:51,719
Flashback tapes.

816
00:59:54,139 --> 00:59:56,139
Are these like super challenges or something?

817
00:59:56,139 --> 00:59:59,989
This looks hard.

818
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:29,380
Cool.

819
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:30,340
Oh, I like this.

820
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:31,219
It's like a little puzzle.

821
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:46,889
Oops.

822
01:00:47,449 --> 01:00:48,010
Oh, shit.

823
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:48,489
It's okay.

824
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,039
I don't think it's okay anymore.

825
01:00:54,739 --> 01:00:55,239
No.

826
01:00:56,179 --> 01:00:56,679
Shit.

827
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,280
All right, I'll do it again.

828
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:00,599
I'll do it again.

829
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:01,719
I'll do it again.

830
01:01:01,719 --> 01:01:04,119
I thought it was going to break when I jumped.

831
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:06,920
I thought it was going to break when I jumped left and then over.

832
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,360
I thought that was only whatever.

833
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:45,769
One, two, three, four, five.

834
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:05,960
Yes.

835
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:06,920
Okay, I got them all.

836
01:02:06,920 --> 01:03:09,480
Nice.

837
01:03:10,179 --> 01:03:11,050
Got them all.

838
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:13,320
Got it.

839
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:14,360
118.

840
01:03:15,719 --> 01:03:16,360
So what do I get?

841
01:03:17,239 --> 01:03:17,880
I like those.

842
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:18,380
These are fun.

843
01:03:24,039 --> 01:03:24,539
Cool.

844
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:25,880
What do I get for that?

845
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:38,809
Okay, hit the road.

846
01:03:38,809 --> 01:03:41,000
I almost hit the boss.

847
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:47,369
Hey, Bruce Wayne here.

848
01:03:47,369 --> 01:03:49,289
I'll pay you a billion dollars if you do a scorn.

849
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:52,139
I don't want a billion dollars.

850
01:03:52,139 --> 01:03:52,699
I just don't.

851
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:06,809
I don't want a billion dollars.

852
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:07,369
No, fuck that.

853
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:08,670
No.

854
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,280
Look at these levels.

855
01:04:32,599 --> 01:04:34,599
Look at how many baseball streams you could do with that.

856
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:36,630
Oh, okay.

857
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:39,750
Are you talking about like a personal income?

858
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:40,949
Like personal money you get?

859
01:04:40,949 --> 01:04:43,829
Or are you talking about like financing stuff?

860
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:47,960
How did I go behind that?

861
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:50,280
Are you talking about like company?

862
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:55,340
Like I got a billion dollar company and I can make like whatever I want.

863
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:58,840
I don't want...

864
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:01,079
I don't personally want a billion dollars.

865
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,679
But if I had like a billion dollar valued company...

866
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,360
Okay, well, what?

867
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,400
How many employees do I have?

868
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,000
What do my sales look like?

869
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,440
I don't want a fucking billion dollars.

870
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:10,940
No way.

871
01:05:13,239 --> 01:05:16,440
When you cross the billion dollar threshold, that's when you start to go like...

872
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:21,659
Oh, you know, I had a dream that I had a bowling alley in my fucking living room.

873
01:05:21,659 --> 01:05:22,460
So I'm going to do it.

874
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:23,659
It's like, I don't know, man.

875
01:05:23,659 --> 01:05:24,940
I don't want to do that.

876
01:05:25,659 --> 01:05:28,599
Hey, you know what?

877
01:05:28,599 --> 01:05:32,380
I feel like this very specific type of cheese this afternoon.

878
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:33,260
Get it!

879
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:37,179
And like somebody gets on a plane and flies to get this cheese from Italy to bring it to you.

880
01:05:37,179 --> 01:05:38,579
Because you wanted it today.

881
01:05:38,579 --> 01:05:39,380
I don't know.

882
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:40,500
I feel like that's too much.

883
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:41,860
I think it's way too much power.

884
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:42,599
I don't want it.

885
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:45,369
And I died.

886
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:55,110
Oh, there is a jump on the head.

887
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:55,610
Okay.

888
01:05:56,070 --> 01:06:07,460
Stupid.

889
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:09,860
If I ever had a billion dollars in money...

890
01:06:11,610 --> 01:06:12,809
I'm being completely honest.

891
01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:15,610
I would take 10 million.

892
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:17,050
No, 20 million.

893
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:18,190
Yeah.

894
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:21,619
I would take 20 million dollars and just keep it.

895
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:22,739
Anything I ever wanted.

896
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:24,980
And then I would just like, I don't know.

897
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:28,659
I would go try to rebuild as many schools in America as I could.

898
01:06:28,659 --> 01:06:29,139
Right?

899
01:06:29,139 --> 01:06:30,500
Just like, just do it.

900
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:33,820
But I'm keeping 25 million.

901
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:34,460
I am.

902
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:34,960
I'm sorry.

903
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:37,500
No, maybe 50.

904
01:06:39,219 --> 01:06:40,340
I would, I want 50.

905
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:41,699
Why can I not kill this fucking guy?

906
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:45,699
That's like two schools.

907
01:06:45,699 --> 01:06:50,250
Well, I don't know.

908
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:51,849
How much?

909
01:06:51,849 --> 01:06:54,650
Okay, you had 800 million dollars.

910
01:06:56,300 --> 01:07:00,739
Like, could you cover like half the textbooks

911
01:07:00,739 --> 01:07:03,059
that like college students would need to buy in America?

912
01:07:03,059 --> 01:07:03,780
How much would you need?

913
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:09,510
And it'd be like, it'd be like the, I don't know.

914
01:07:10,389 --> 01:07:10,889
No.

915
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:13,030
Would that be for like one school?

916
01:07:16,039 --> 01:07:16,760
No, it would.

917
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:19,559
A billion dollars to buy text?

918
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:20,119
No way.

919
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:21,000
For one school?

920
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,679
What the fuck's happening to your education?

921
01:07:23,559 --> 01:07:27,940
I've touched that every time.

922
01:07:28,659 --> 01:07:39,659
Anything else?

923
01:07:39,659 --> 01:07:41,849
Yeah, I'm keeping 20 million.

924
01:07:42,489 --> 01:07:49,449
You bet your ass I'm going to buy that vintage Pac-Man machine.

925
01:07:50,409 --> 01:07:51,610
Signed by Pac-Man.

926
01:07:56,150 --> 01:08:14,070
You know I'm buying that.

927
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:14,949
The Pac-Man?

928
01:08:14,949 --> 01:08:15,909
That's what I'm saying.

929
01:08:15,909 --> 01:08:23,909
A tape?

930
01:08:23,909 --> 01:08:27,420
How come I can't get this?

931
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:31,670
Why is it grayed out?

932
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:38,949
How come you, why are you acting like you're not already a billionaire cheese heir?

933
01:08:39,829 --> 01:08:58,310
Oh shit, should have done that.

934
01:08:58,310 --> 01:09:01,770
I have to come back.

935
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:03,909
I think, yeah.

936
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:09,670
Okay, I got it.

937
01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:13,880
Do you not have any makeup on today?

938
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,159
No, I shaved my face.

939
01:09:16,199 --> 01:09:17,319
Yes, guys.

940
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:18,760
I'm way far behind.

941
01:09:19,479 --> 01:09:23,899
Guys, humans look a little different when they change their hairstyle and their facial hair.

942
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:31,270
Shaved the makeup off.

943
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:33,590
Oh, hold on, I got a face of makeup on.

944
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:34,710
It's time to shave it.

945
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:40,460
Wait, no, I'm just wrong.

946
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:44,859
Where's the thing?

947
01:09:44,859 --> 01:09:45,260
Back here?

948
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:59,770
There, okay.

949
01:09:59,770 --> 01:10:00,170
Let's go.

950
01:10:00,729 --> 01:10:07,380
Okay, didn't hit it.

951
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:11,670
Looks good.

952
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:13,479
Am I doing this right though?

953
01:10:13,479 --> 01:10:13,800
I don't know.

954
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:22,439
Kind of afraid.

955
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:30,460
Guys, you have to slide and just jump.

956
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:31,500
Can you do it?

957
01:10:33,079 --> 01:10:34,119
Okay, I can do a slide jump.

958
01:10:36,619 --> 01:10:37,500
Like Breath of the Wild?

959
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:42,279
Maybe eventually.

960
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:48,600
Do I have this first part accurate though?

961
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,119
I don't want to step on this yet, right?

962
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:55,770
I think that's correct.

963
01:10:55,770 --> 01:10:57,770
And then I get these and then I step on it.

964
01:10:57,770 --> 01:11:14,149
Okay.

965
01:11:17,399 --> 01:11:19,000
Oh my god, how did I not die?

966
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:25,699
All right, now I go turn them back on, right?

967
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,260
I turn it on because now I have to destroy them.

968
01:11:43,930 --> 01:11:47,050
Okay, nice.

969
01:11:47,609 --> 01:11:48,090
There it is.

970
01:11:48,649 --> 01:11:49,050
All right.

971
01:11:49,609 --> 01:11:53,180
What are you doing?

972
01:11:54,140 --> 01:12:12,840
I just, shit, I fucked it up.

973
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:18,979
I just poured.

974
01:12:19,619 --> 01:12:22,500
I just opened up the spout and went over to a chef.

975
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:27,460
Making like a three-day fuck and just jumped salt in it.

976
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:29,380
Just around the corner.

977
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:30,500
Just held it out with the spout.

978
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,579
Like, you ruined everything.

979
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:42,520
I have to lose.

980
01:12:43,159 --> 01:12:54,279
Will the nitro destroy the blocks that aren't active?

981
01:12:54,920 --> 01:13:01,100
Will that, is it, it doesn't?

982
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:01,899
No, it won't work.

983
01:13:02,619 --> 01:13:05,939
They have to be active, right?

984
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:11,430
I'm gonna test it.

985
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:13,220
I'm testing this.

986
01:13:15,739 --> 01:13:17,739
What even, why did it explode?

987
01:13:17,739 --> 01:13:19,100
I thought I touched it.

988
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:19,819
Oh, fuck.

989
01:13:19,819 --> 01:13:20,539
Okay.

990
01:13:20,539 --> 01:13:22,300
I thought you had to break it to have it blow up.

991
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:22,779
No, touch it.

992
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:41,260
Relax, everybody.

993
01:13:41,819 --> 01:13:56,579
Let's try this.

994
01:13:57,979 --> 01:13:58,779
Don't do that.

995
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:03,180
Okay.

996
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:07,449
So, don't break anything because I don't, let's see what happens.

997
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:10,539
Did that work?

998
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:12,390
I don't know.

999
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:15,380
Did, right?

1000
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:19,770
It did.

1001
01:14:19,770 --> 01:14:20,250
Thank god.

1002
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:49,579
Yes!

1003
01:14:50,140 --> 01:15:03,829
Just don't get killed because I don't have a checkpoint.

1004
01:15:03,829 --> 01:15:05,029
This game is so brutal.

1005
01:15:05,029 --> 01:15:06,789
It does not fucking hold your hand.

1006
01:15:06,789 --> 01:15:09,220
God, that's why I like it though.

1007
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:10,100
Game doesn't hold your hand.

1008
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:16,060
This is brutal.

1009
01:15:29,699 --> 01:15:30,260
Oops.

1010
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:36,340
Oh!

1011
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:37,060
Swing already.

1012
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:37,460
Jesus.

1013
01:15:38,979 --> 01:15:40,979
Oh, you can't be fucking serious.

1014
01:15:40,979 --> 01:15:43,060
You hit me with the, you hit me with the backswing?

1015
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:46,569
You weren't even in the middle of a swing and you hit me.

1016
01:15:47,369 --> 01:15:49,210
Thank god I didn't have to do the bonus again.

1017
01:16:11,079 --> 01:16:11,880
Yeah.

1018
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:14,340
How do I see the HUD again?

1019
01:16:19,579 --> 01:16:20,220
Okay.

1020
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:23,020
Oh, that's crazy.

1021
01:16:23,819 --> 01:16:25,100
You should eat an apple on stream.

1022
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:27,420
I don't know.

1023
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:29,739
I don't know why that's a, that's a, that's a weird request.

1024
01:16:30,699 --> 01:16:31,590
Don't you think so?

1025
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:37,829
Oh dude, eat an apple on stream.

1026
01:16:37,829 --> 01:16:38,069
Why?

1027
01:16:38,069 --> 01:16:39,989
Like that's a, that's a weird request.

1028
01:16:41,029 --> 01:16:42,390
And I lost because of that person.

1029
01:16:42,949 --> 01:16:50,890
I don't know what the fuck I thought that was.

1030
01:16:50,890 --> 01:16:51,689
I thought it was going to fall.

1031
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:16,939
Oh, does it come back down?

1032
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:30,140
Don't just have patience, please.

1033
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:30,779
Eat an apple.

1034
01:17:31,979 --> 01:17:33,609
I don't like apples.

1035
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:37,590
I like Macintosh apples and that's it.

1036
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:40,859
I really like green apples are okay.

1037
01:17:41,819 --> 01:17:43,750
We already did the tier list thing.

1038
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:44,149
You already know.

1039
01:17:44,710 --> 01:18:03,800
Oh my god.

1040
01:18:05,539 --> 01:18:06,579
Yeah, it's okay.

1041
01:18:30,229 --> 01:18:31,590
What the fuck, man?

1042
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:31,909
What?

1043
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:37,590
You aren't very good at this.

1044
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:39,750
This game is notoriously difficult.

1045
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:41,029
It even says it on the box.

1046
01:18:41,829 --> 01:18:52,380
All right.

1047
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:53,819
Let me see if I can get this right.

1048
01:18:57,449 --> 01:18:57,770
Nope.

1049
01:18:58,729 --> 01:19:00,649
Um, you can't get up there from that way.

1050
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:07,460
Yeah, this bullshit.

1051
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:10,020
Some of you guys have told me that you have permanent fight marks

1052
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:11,859
on your PlayStation 1 controller because of this game.

1053
01:19:17,819 --> 01:19:18,939
I just forgot how to play.

1054
01:19:18,939 --> 01:19:19,180
I'm...

1055
01:19:40,390 --> 01:19:42,789
Oh, I thought it was already there.

1056
01:19:43,670 --> 01:20:05,350
Wait, I need to break this.

1057
01:20:05,350 --> 01:20:08,600
Can I break this without breaking that?

1058
01:20:09,399 --> 01:20:09,899
Yeah.

1059
01:20:09,899 --> 01:20:10,460
Okay.

1060
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:10,779
Shit.

1061
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:17,930
Come on.

1062
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:18,329
Hurry up.

1063
01:20:30,779 --> 01:20:31,340
Sorry.

1064
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:38,279
How do I get up there?

1065
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:39,800
I think I have to fall.

1066
01:20:43,909 --> 01:20:44,390
Checkpoint.

1067
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:44,869
Thank god.

1068
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:50,010
How do I get up there?

1069
01:20:58,310 --> 01:20:59,109
Ooh.

1070
01:20:59,109 --> 01:21:00,310
Um, okay.

1071
01:21:00,949 --> 01:21:04,789
How am I supposed to do this?

1072
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:09,050
Got it.

1073
01:21:09,050 --> 01:21:12,859
Diamond.

1074
01:21:12,859 --> 01:21:13,739
I need to destroy this.

1075
01:21:15,909 --> 01:21:16,949
How am I going to do that?

1076
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:21,289
How do I break that without getting hurt?

1077
01:21:21,930 --> 01:21:24,250
Oh, the night...

1078
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:24,729
Okay, it will.

1079
01:21:24,729 --> 01:21:25,130
It will.

1080
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:25,770
All right.

1081
01:21:25,770 --> 01:21:26,409
It will blow up.

1082
01:21:38,779 --> 01:21:39,659
Oh my god.

1083
01:21:39,659 --> 01:21:41,340
I didn't even see what was happening.

1084
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:42,460
Did I get this?

1085
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:45,220
I got that, right?

1086
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:45,939
Yeah.

1087
01:21:45,939 --> 01:22:36,649
This game is way harder than the Spongebob game.

1088
01:22:36,649 --> 01:22:46,470
Come on.

1089
01:22:46,470 --> 01:22:47,109
Are you kidding me?

1090
01:22:47,109 --> 01:22:47,909
I jumped behind...

1091
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:49,960
I jumped behind it.

1092
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:53,050
I think I can still get it.

1093
01:22:53,689 --> 01:23:00,970
Yeah.

1094
01:23:00,970 --> 01:23:01,210
All right.

1095
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:02,010
We're good.

1096
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:24,460
This game's hard.

1097
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:36,810
This game's kind of hard.

1098
01:23:36,810 --> 01:23:37,460
I'm scared.

1099
01:23:38,579 --> 01:23:50,920
Okay, you can still jump.

1100
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:51,720
I didn't think you could.

1101
01:24:10,949 --> 01:24:19,899
It's hard to get all those.

1102
01:24:19,899 --> 01:24:21,420
That's so fucking hard.

1103
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:25,020
Part two.

1104
01:24:39,579 --> 01:24:40,060
Jesus.

1105
01:24:47,829 --> 01:24:48,229
Nice.

1106
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:49,539
Oh.

1107
01:24:51,380 --> 01:25:10,170
How come there's no taunt?

1108
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:11,289
I can't be like...

1109
01:25:11,289 --> 01:25:11,850
Boom.

1110
01:25:11,850 --> 01:25:15,579
It should be.

1111
01:25:15,579 --> 01:25:16,380
That's unfortunate.

1112
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:17,180
It's okay.

1113
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:18,119
That's still a lot.

1114
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:25,720
You get this game for a kid that you hate.

1115
01:25:26,199 --> 01:25:27,140
What?

1116
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:32,180
The game's very good.

1117
01:25:32,180 --> 01:25:35,350
It's a very...

1118
01:25:35,350 --> 01:25:36,789
This is a very good game.

1119
01:25:36,789 --> 01:25:48,789
All right.

1120
01:25:48,789 --> 01:25:49,189
This is it.

1121
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:50,220
All right.

1122
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:58,659
Let's switch to this one.

1123
01:25:58,659 --> 01:26:00,550
All right.

1124
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:01,029
This is a boss.

1125
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:01,989
Let's do it.

1126
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:20,100
Rocket head.

1127
01:26:36,569 --> 01:26:36,970
All right.

1128
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:46,739
All right.

1129
01:26:46,739 --> 01:26:47,140
Target.

1130
01:26:47,699 --> 01:26:49,430
Oh, I got to get up there.

1131
01:26:49,430 --> 01:26:49,750
All right.

1132
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:49,909
Go.

1133
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,039
Come on, Crash.

1134
01:26:54,039 --> 01:26:54,520
Hurry.

1135
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:01,300
Come on, Crash.

1136
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:01,699
Hurry.

1137
01:27:04,010 --> 01:27:05,930
Oh, I hit the fucking back of the head.

1138
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:18,039
Come on, Sora.

1139
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:21,100
I didn't get the Sora right,

1140
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:21,899
but I got everything else.

1141
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:39,609
You're going to throw somebody out here already?

1142
01:27:40,329 --> 01:27:42,789
All right.

1143
01:27:42,789 --> 01:27:43,510
Let's go.

1144
01:27:43,510 --> 01:27:49,500
Oh, shit.

1145
01:27:50,140 --> 01:28:00,789
Play Kingdom Hearts?

1146
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:02,420
No.

1147
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:02,979
I'm sorry.

1148
01:28:02,979 --> 01:28:06,899
I don't have a spare 400 hours to play that on stream.

1149
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:12,439
That's just for the opening cut scene.

1150
01:28:12,439 --> 01:28:14,199
So I just don't have time for that.

1151
01:28:15,079 --> 01:28:15,640
Oh, my God.

1152
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:15,960
I died.

1153
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:19,930
Did I start over?

1154
01:28:19,930 --> 01:28:20,170
No.

1155
01:28:42,090 --> 01:28:44,090
Kingdom Hearts 2.

1156
01:28:44,970 --> 01:28:46,939
That's all I remember.

1157
01:28:59,449 --> 01:28:59,850
One more.

1158
01:29:02,949 --> 01:29:03,590
Oh, shit.

1159
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:06,020
Oh, okay.

1160
01:29:06,899 --> 01:29:08,579
Excuse me.

1161
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:18,600
This is some frogger shit right now.

1162
01:29:24,550 --> 01:29:25,189
Oh, my God.

1163
01:29:25,189 --> 01:29:26,069
I missed that.

1164
01:29:26,069 --> 01:29:35,140
Where did they go?

1165
01:29:37,180 --> 01:29:38,060
Are you kidding me?

1166
01:29:54,359 --> 01:30:09,770
Oh, what a bad place to stop for a second.

1167
01:30:09,770 --> 01:30:19,239
See you.

1168
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:29,140
Phase two?

1169
01:30:33,850 --> 01:30:34,409
I don't think so.

1170
01:31:11,319 --> 01:31:12,840
Oh, I like the way this one looks.

1171
01:31:16,890 --> 01:31:17,609
Cool.

1172
01:31:17,609 --> 01:31:22,279
Booty calls.

1173
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:28,310
And he looks so proud of himself.

1174
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:41,020
Mom said it was my turn.

1175
01:31:41,659 --> 01:31:48,060
Well, it can be all of our turns.

1176
01:31:48,859 --> 01:31:49,579
It's cloud gaming.

1177
01:32:00,939 --> 01:32:16,869
Whoa, I don't think I can hurt them.

1178
01:32:16,869 --> 01:32:17,829
Are you high?

1179
01:32:17,829 --> 01:32:25,750
No.

1180
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:26,789
Yeah, what a great idea.

1181
01:32:30,390 --> 01:32:33,899
You honestly think that would be a smart decision today?

1182
01:32:34,539 --> 01:32:35,979
Do you think that's a good idea today?

1183
01:32:36,619 --> 01:32:37,100
Think about it.

1184
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:40,619
I want you to I just want you to think about what you just said.

1185
01:32:40,619 --> 01:32:41,979
I want you to think it's a good idea.

1186
01:32:42,949 --> 01:32:44,390
I don't think the answer is yes.

1187
01:32:45,109 --> 01:32:49,060
I think the answer is a 100% no.

1188
01:32:55,689 --> 01:32:56,409
Yeah, fucking.

1189
01:32:58,579 --> 01:33:00,260
Fuck your rivers of blood bullshit.

1190
01:33:00,819 --> 01:33:03,560
Should get the past that shit out of the game already.

1191
01:33:12,869 --> 01:33:16,020
They did good.

1192
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:30,220
Oh, you can hit me.

1193
01:33:30,220 --> 01:33:32,039
Let's go.

1194
01:33:32,039 --> 01:33:32,840
I like this outfit.

1195
01:33:34,789 --> 01:33:36,149
You don't play Elden Ring anymore.

1196
01:33:38,420 --> 01:33:42,260
Yeah, because I need to forget every single thing that happens in the game.

1197
01:33:42,899 --> 01:33:46,020
And then once every year or two, go back and play the whole thing again.

1198
01:33:46,659 --> 01:33:49,989
That's how it works.

1199
01:33:50,630 --> 01:33:52,340
Did I get this?

1200
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:56,100
I guess I already got it.

1201
01:33:56,100 --> 01:34:04,340
The best part about the from software games is you just forget about them for a year or two.

1202
01:34:05,319 --> 01:34:07,960
Come back and play a class you never played before.

1203
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:10,199
And it's just a completely different video game.

1204
01:34:11,079 --> 01:34:13,739
It's the best way to do it.

1205
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:17,819
All right.

1206
01:34:17,819 --> 01:34:20,140
Can I even attack this guy or jump on his head?

1207
01:34:20,140 --> 01:34:20,380
Right.

1208
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:25,779
The DLC is coming.

1209
01:34:29,579 --> 01:34:30,539
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

1210
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:48,619
Getting up here.

1211
01:34:52,819 --> 01:34:54,260
Did you do me strong?

1212
01:34:54,260 --> 01:34:54,899
No, I didn't.

1213
01:34:57,130 --> 01:34:58,489
I floundered.

1214
01:34:58,489 --> 01:34:59,770
I flaked on me strong.

1215
01:35:11,380 --> 01:35:12,899
Oh, should I just die?

1216
01:35:12,899 --> 01:35:13,380
Just die.

1217
01:35:17,899 --> 01:35:20,460
That's I don't want to miss that way too important.

1218
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:40,789
Okay.

1219
01:35:40,789 --> 01:35:42,550
Why would it be a question mark if I know what it is?

1220
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:53,930
Excuse me.

1221
01:35:53,930 --> 01:35:55,050
How do I get over there?

1222
01:35:55,050 --> 01:35:56,380
Did you see that?

1223
01:36:01,050 --> 01:36:02,250
Oh, my goodness.

1224
01:36:02,250 --> 01:36:12,979
Well, I couldn't know.

1225
01:36:12,979 --> 01:36:22,329
That was hard.

1226
01:36:22,329 --> 01:36:24,170
Actually getting 100% there would be difficult.

1227
01:36:24,170 --> 01:36:26,409
And there was a whole nother thing of that section with.

1228
01:36:27,529 --> 01:36:30,119
You know what I mean?

1229
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:33,100
You know what I'm saying?

1230
01:36:33,100 --> 01:36:40,020
It was very pretty.

1231
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:47,340
Everything from here to all the way down there looks really nice.

1232
01:36:48,060 --> 01:36:50,199
You know what I'm saying?

1233
01:36:50,199 --> 01:36:52,039
Webcam is getting annoying.

1234
01:36:52,039 --> 01:36:52,920
Hold on.

1235
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:59,449
We got to change this better.

1236
01:36:59,449 --> 01:37:03,210
Not as much movement.

1237
01:37:03,210 --> 01:37:04,170
Yeah, that's better.

1238
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:16,920
The lights are going down for Gotham Knights, though.

1239
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:17,560
You better believe it.

1240
01:37:24,739 --> 01:37:31,159
And by the way, nobody said anything about the shirt today.

1241
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:47,560
Can we please get a Bane impression during the Gotham Knights game?

1242
01:37:48,819 --> 01:37:49,539
Yeah.

1243
01:37:49,539 --> 01:37:58,329
Which one?

1244
01:37:58,329 --> 01:38:00,170
Do you want the iconic today?

1245
01:38:00,890 --> 01:38:01,130
Right.

1246
01:38:01,770 --> 01:38:02,810
That's the iconic line.

1247
01:38:03,529 --> 01:38:04,090
I can do that.

1248
01:38:05,189 --> 01:38:06,229
I think I can handle that.

1249
01:38:19,220 --> 01:38:20,100
That was a bad idea.

1250
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:21,140
I'm in trouble.

1251
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:21,880
Does it come back?

1252
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:25,479
Thank God.

1253
01:38:38,439 --> 01:38:38,760
Troll.

1254
01:38:55,449 --> 01:38:57,930
Dude, there's no opportunity to go anywhere.

1255
01:38:57,930 --> 01:39:00,810
I'm going back because I don't want to miss any cubes.

1256
01:39:01,449 --> 01:39:05,989
I don't care.

1257
01:39:05,989 --> 01:39:33,180
I have the exact same acne as you right now.

1258
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:42,579
You mean this?

1259
01:39:42,579 --> 01:39:45,640
No, I caught myself shaving.

1260
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:57,619
That's a shave cut.

1261
01:39:57,619 --> 01:39:58,819
Yeah, that's a shave cut.

1262
01:39:58,819 --> 01:40:06,090
It's a giant pimple.

1263
01:40:06,090 --> 01:40:06,649
It's not.

1264
01:40:06,649 --> 01:40:08,090
It's a shaving.

1265
01:40:08,090 --> 01:40:15,899
We'll blow that one up, too.

1266
01:40:15,899 --> 01:40:28,170
Okay.

1267
01:40:28,170 --> 01:40:35,189
What do we do about this?

1268
01:40:35,189 --> 01:40:41,300
Why was it there the last time when you had facial hair?

1269
01:40:41,300 --> 01:40:45,750
It wasn't.

1270
01:40:45,750 --> 01:40:52,340
How do I break that without getting hurt?

1271
01:40:52,340 --> 01:40:52,659
It was.

1272
01:40:52,659 --> 01:40:53,619
No, it wasn't.

1273
01:40:53,619 --> 01:41:03,340
It was not.

1274
01:41:03,340 --> 01:41:14,939
22.

1275
01:41:14,939 --> 01:41:15,500
There it is.

1276
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:18,520
How do I get out of here?

1277
01:41:23,770 --> 01:41:25,609
We should grow a Gandalf beard.

1278
01:41:26,170 --> 01:41:36,260
I don't know.

1279
01:41:36,260 --> 01:41:41,539
If I grew a Gandalf beard, I probably would get it all scooped up and twist it and put

1280
01:41:41,539 --> 01:41:45,939
it in my mouth and be like, oh, oh, I don't know.

1281
01:41:45,939 --> 01:41:47,619
And people would be like, what the fuck is he doing?

1282
01:41:50,060 --> 01:41:51,819
How did you start choking on your beard?

1283
01:42:37,850 --> 01:42:39,689
Dude, bro, how did that even happen?

1284
01:42:41,210 --> 01:42:42,170
How did that happen?

1285
01:43:04,710 --> 01:43:06,789
It's not even that fucking funny.

1286
01:43:06,789 --> 01:43:09,350
It's just everybody hates it.

1287
01:43:09,350 --> 01:43:10,949
Everyone's fucking pissed.

1288
01:43:11,909 --> 01:43:13,430
That's what's doing it for me right now.

1289
01:43:13,430 --> 01:43:15,109
Everybody is pissed that I just said that.

1290
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:17,560
That's so stupid.

1291
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:18,680
Why are we so mad?

1292
01:43:24,439 --> 01:43:25,800
Okay, I'm going to play the game.

1293
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:33,239
Huh?

1294
01:43:33,239 --> 01:43:42,380
Dude, I just keep picturing.

1295
01:43:42,380 --> 01:43:43,500
I pictured Gandalf.

1296
01:43:44,539 --> 01:43:48,619
I keep seeing Gandalf in my head with his whole beard in his mouth.

1297
01:43:48,619 --> 01:43:56,060
And he's going like, and they come into the room like Frodo and Sam and they're like,

1298
01:43:56,060 --> 01:43:57,500
Gandalf, what's happening?

1299
01:43:58,380 --> 01:44:03,020
Ah, he's like freaking out running around like smash and bumping into bookshelves and shit.

1300
01:44:04,859 --> 01:44:06,859
Who told you that must have been a ringwraith?

1301
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:43,159
No, I told you it was a weird day today.

1302
01:44:44,329 --> 01:44:45,130
I did warn you.

1303
01:44:45,130 --> 01:44:46,090
I was very clear.

1304
01:44:47,689 --> 01:44:48,890
Why are you still laughing at it?

1305
01:44:48,890 --> 01:44:50,250
I don't fucking know, dude.

1306
01:44:50,250 --> 01:44:50,810
I don't know.

1307
01:44:51,689 --> 01:44:52,729
I don't, I don't know.

1308
01:44:53,449 --> 01:44:59,189
It's because the chat's reaction was too good.

1309
01:45:08,409 --> 01:45:08,970
Stop.

1310
01:45:08,970 --> 01:45:09,930
I hit him with that.

1311
01:45:34,810 --> 01:45:43,399
I feel like something's hidden up here, right?

1312
01:45:43,399 --> 01:45:44,199
No?

1313
01:45:44,199 --> 01:45:50,840
Three?

1314
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:51,159
Nice.

1315
01:45:51,159 --> 01:45:51,880
Okay.

1316
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:54,409
Grabbed my nose.

1317
01:45:54,409 --> 01:45:55,210
I don't know.

1318
01:45:55,210 --> 01:45:56,500
That's a lot of money.

1319
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:04,359
Dude, Frog Detective 3 is coming out on October 26th.

1320
01:46:04,359 --> 01:46:07,460
Please, you're going to play it, right?

1321
01:46:07,460 --> 01:46:08,979
Um, yeah, probably.

1322
01:46:22,310 --> 01:46:24,390
All right, let me get to the end of this section.

1323
01:46:24,390 --> 01:46:25,350
Let me do the boss here.

1324
01:46:25,989 --> 01:46:26,789
This is a great game.

1325
01:46:26,789 --> 01:46:27,189
I like it.

1326
01:46:27,909 --> 01:46:35,619
I don't know.

1327
01:46:35,619 --> 01:46:35,939
What do you think?

1328
01:46:35,939 --> 01:46:37,380
Do you think we go right into Gotham Knights?

1329
01:46:37,380 --> 01:46:38,260
What are you guys thinking?

1330
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:49,399
You guys feel good?

1331
01:46:49,399 --> 01:46:50,520
I want to play this for a little bit longer.

1332
01:46:51,079 --> 01:46:59,449
Yeah, I'll take a pee break.

1333
01:47:00,090 --> 01:47:02,090
Maybe in a few minutes of this.

1334
01:47:02,810 --> 01:47:07,430
Another, like, I want to beat the boss here.

1335
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:10,949
Wait, who am I?

1336
01:47:10,949 --> 01:47:11,670
My new character?

1337
01:47:13,340 --> 01:47:14,619
This is a different character.

1338
01:47:19,210 --> 01:47:19,609
Who is this?

1339
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:43,479
Well, I never mind.

1340
01:47:43,479 --> 01:47:46,039
I think the story ended pretty quickly.

1341
01:47:52,619 --> 01:47:55,420
Dude, I can't get the image of Gandalf out of my head.

1342
01:47:55,420 --> 01:47:56,619
It's up there permanently.

1343
01:48:01,670 --> 01:48:02,310
Hook shot?

1344
01:48:09,859 --> 01:48:10,579
Whoa.

1345
01:48:10,579 --> 01:48:13,770
Does it do damage?

1346
01:48:13,770 --> 01:48:14,810
It does do damage.

1347
01:48:14,810 --> 01:48:15,130
All right.

1348
01:48:22,619 --> 01:48:22,939
Cool.

1349
01:48:26,439 --> 01:48:27,000
Very cool.

1350
01:48:36,250 --> 01:48:36,649
All right.

1351
01:48:37,699 --> 01:48:38,020
Okay.

1352
01:48:38,579 --> 01:48:46,260
Ball jump.

1353
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:50,920
That's pretty clean.

1354
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:51,319
I like it.

1355
01:48:51,319 --> 01:48:58,199
Are there emotes?

1356
01:49:07,270 --> 01:49:07,989
That's clean.

1357
01:49:07,989 --> 01:49:09,029
I like it a lot.

1358
01:49:09,029 --> 01:49:10,149
That's a very clean move.

1359
01:49:22,100 --> 01:49:23,140
Come here.

1360
01:49:23,140 --> 01:49:23,939
I'm trying to do my joke.

1361
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:28,100
I could probably do a pretty good scorpion.

1362
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:28,420
I'll try it.

1363
01:49:28,420 --> 01:49:29,060
It's going to be loud.

1364
01:49:29,699 --> 01:49:32,470
I'm going to do it loud.

1365
01:49:32,470 --> 01:49:33,750
So just be ready.

1366
01:49:34,470 --> 01:49:37,189
I think I could probably do a pretty good job.

1367
01:50:08,779 --> 01:50:09,579
Get over here.

1368
01:50:11,210 --> 01:50:11,850
Come here.

1369
01:50:14,649 --> 01:50:15,130
That's all right.

1370
01:50:15,130 --> 01:50:15,689
It was okay.

1371
01:50:16,489 --> 01:50:25,060
It needs a little work.

1372
01:50:25,060 --> 01:50:25,300
Yeah.

1373
01:50:25,939 --> 01:50:33,539
Try to grab this stupid.

1374
01:50:33,699 --> 01:50:34,180
Fucking thing.

1375
01:50:57,180 --> 01:50:58,300
I got to go for the stun.

1376
01:50:58,300 --> 01:50:58,619
Stun.

1377
01:50:59,579 --> 01:50:59,979
Stunned.

1378
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:05,449
How do I get that?

1379
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:12,149
Like that?

1380
01:51:12,149 --> 01:51:12,310
Okay.

1381
01:51:12,310 --> 01:51:12,550
Cool.

1382
01:51:16,659 --> 01:51:18,039
Holy shit.

1383
01:51:18,039 --> 01:51:18,359
Okay.

1384
01:51:18,359 --> 01:51:18,680
I'm fine.

1385
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:33,880
That thing says you're going to die.

1386
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:44,229
Watch out for the shock.

1387
01:51:59,590 --> 01:51:59,909
Nice.

1388
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:17,500
What are you talking about?

1389
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:18,939
You just literally turned around.

1390
01:52:36,539 --> 01:52:37,500
I'm rushing.

1391
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:58,649
Okay.

1392
01:52:59,289 --> 01:53:00,250
Don't fuck this up.

1393
01:54:07,510 --> 01:54:08,390
All right.

1394
01:54:08,390 --> 01:54:09,909
I can't touch them at all.

1395
01:54:09,909 --> 01:54:11,029
Even if the back is, excuse me.

1396
01:54:11,829 --> 01:54:16,739
You don't.

1397
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:18,340
Well, I don't even fight you.

1398
01:54:18,340 --> 01:54:19,300
What the hell am I doing?

1399
01:54:19,300 --> 01:54:19,699
Who cares?

1400
01:54:20,420 --> 01:54:27,020
I feel like that was there for a reason.

1401
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:27,739
I don't know what though.

1402
01:54:28,539 --> 01:54:31,939
Probably was there for a reason, right?

1403
01:54:55,430 --> 01:54:56,229
Oh my God.

1404
01:54:56,229 --> 01:54:56,470
What?

1405
01:55:16,170 --> 01:55:34,939
Shoot.

1406
01:55:34,939 --> 01:55:42,229
Much better.

1407
01:55:42,229 --> 01:55:43,029
Much better.

1408
01:55:43,029 --> 01:55:43,590
There we go.

1409
01:55:52,329 --> 01:55:52,970
Oh boy.

1410
01:55:58,649 --> 01:55:59,689
96 out of 100.

1411
01:56:00,329 --> 01:56:02,810
All right.

1412
01:56:02,810 --> 01:56:03,130
Cool.

1413
01:56:03,130 --> 01:56:03,529
That's good.

1414
01:56:18,949 --> 01:56:19,109
Okay.

1415
01:56:19,109 --> 01:56:20,229
Somebody's linked me an edit.

1416
01:56:21,319 --> 01:56:23,319
The mods just linked me a Gandalf edit.

1417
01:56:23,319 --> 01:56:24,920
That's not what I'm talking about.

1418
01:56:24,920 --> 01:56:25,079
No.

1419
01:56:26,619 --> 01:56:27,340
He got it wrong.

1420
01:56:31,380 --> 01:56:33,930
Thank you so much.

1421
01:56:34,569 --> 01:56:35,130
Wait.

1422
01:56:35,130 --> 01:56:36,090
Tana?

1423
01:56:36,090 --> 01:56:38,090
But you're different.

1424
01:56:39,689 --> 01:56:41,770
You're not from our universe.

1425
01:56:44,729 --> 01:56:46,170
It's good to see you guys.

1426
01:56:46,170 --> 01:56:48,090
It's been a long time for me.

1427
01:56:48,729 --> 01:56:50,729
We lost touch in your universe too, huh?

1428
01:56:51,369 --> 01:56:52,010
Yeah.

1429
01:56:52,010 --> 01:56:53,369
You could say that.

1430
01:56:54,729 --> 01:56:56,649
What did we like die or something?

1431
01:56:56,649 --> 01:56:56,970
What?

1432
01:56:56,970 --> 01:56:57,529
No.

1433
01:56:57,529 --> 01:56:58,090
Nope.

1434
01:56:58,090 --> 01:57:00,090
No, definitely not.

1435
01:57:00,090 --> 01:57:01,449
So how are things in your dimension?

1436
01:57:02,890 --> 01:57:03,770
The usual.

1437
01:57:04,649 --> 01:57:06,569
A bunch of evil scientists attempting

1438
01:57:06,569 --> 01:57:07,210
It's crashed.

1439
01:57:07,210 --> 01:57:08,170
Hawke.

1440
01:57:08,170 --> 01:57:08,810
Huh.

1441
01:57:08,810 --> 01:57:10,729
So what you're collecting?

1442
01:57:10,729 --> 01:57:11,369
Crystals?

1443
01:57:12,250 --> 01:57:13,130
Gems?

1444
01:57:13,130 --> 01:57:13,770
Masks.

1445
01:57:13,770 --> 01:57:14,649
Ooh.

1446
01:57:14,649 --> 01:57:15,770
Fun.

1447
01:57:15,770 --> 01:57:16,810
Well, good luck with that.

1448
01:57:17,369 --> 01:57:18,010
Wait.

1449
01:57:18,010 --> 01:57:18,810
You're not coming?

1450
01:57:19,369 --> 01:57:19,850
Sorry.

1451
01:57:19,850 --> 01:57:20,810
I fly solo.

1452
01:57:22,859 --> 01:57:24,779
But I'll lend a hand where I can.

1453
01:57:25,340 --> 01:57:27,260
In fact, I already have.

1454
01:57:39,189 --> 01:57:40,069
Oh, he doesn't really talk.

1455
01:57:41,180 --> 01:57:41,979
He just kind of goes like.

1456
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:50,180
Ooh.

1457
01:57:50,180 --> 01:57:50,500
Tape.

1458
01:57:52,939 --> 01:57:53,500
Two tapes?

1459
01:57:54,380 --> 01:57:57,750
Okay.

1460
01:57:58,390 --> 01:58:00,970
I want to do the tape.

1461
01:58:05,260 --> 01:58:05,899
Oh, wait.

1462
01:58:08,069 --> 01:58:09,590
How come there's no other tapes?

1463
01:58:09,590 --> 01:58:15,579
How come you're not talking?

1464
01:58:16,220 --> 01:58:17,260
I am talking right now.

1465
01:58:18,060 --> 01:58:24,739
You have to find them in levels without dying.

1466
01:58:24,739 --> 01:58:25,539
Oh, shit.

1467
01:58:25,539 --> 01:58:25,859
Okay.

1468
01:58:26,819 --> 01:58:27,300
Good to know.

1469
01:58:33,159 --> 01:58:36,039
After this boss, we'll move on to Gotham Knights.

1470
01:58:38,010 --> 01:58:38,489
Seems fun.

1471
01:58:47,239 --> 01:58:48,199
Just tried to grapple hook.

1472
01:58:48,199 --> 01:58:49,079
That was a mistake.

1473
01:58:50,710 --> 01:58:51,909
I'm not going to get the tape in this one.

1474
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:00,739
I get it, though.

1475
01:59:01,619 --> 01:59:03,539
I swear to God, I don't even fucking get it.

1476
01:59:04,180 --> 01:59:07,340
I get it.

1477
01:59:07,979 --> 01:59:08,699
Talk louder.

1478
01:59:09,739 --> 01:59:10,859
Why would I talk louder?

1479
01:59:10,859 --> 01:59:11,180
What is?

1480
01:59:12,539 --> 01:59:12,779
No.

1481
01:59:13,659 --> 01:59:15,260
This is the volume I'm going to be speaking.

1482
01:59:15,260 --> 01:59:22,630
If you've got a problem, then I don't know what to tell you.

1483
01:59:28,899 --> 01:59:29,939
So what characters are you?

1484
01:59:29,939 --> 01:59:31,699
I mean, I'm starting with Nightwing, right?

1485
01:59:31,699 --> 01:59:32,819
I'm going to be playing with Nightwing.

1486
01:59:33,859 --> 01:59:34,979
Oh, my goodness.

1487
01:59:34,979 --> 01:59:35,539
That was he.

1488
01:59:35,539 --> 01:59:36,340
What did he hit me with?

1489
01:59:38,649 --> 01:59:39,689
Holy shit.

1490
01:59:39,689 --> 01:59:41,609
I just blew off the screen.

1491
01:59:43,050 --> 01:59:46,250
I had like 600% in Multiverses.

1492
01:59:46,250 --> 01:59:46,890
Or Smash Bros.

1493
01:59:46,890 --> 01:59:47,609
Multiverses.

1494
01:59:47,609 --> 01:59:49,380
Let me say Multiverses.

1495
01:59:49,380 --> 01:59:50,979
I had 600% in Multiverses.

1496
02:00:15,060 --> 02:00:16,180
Stripe was fun.

1497
02:00:16,180 --> 02:00:17,529
I played with them for a little while.

1498
02:00:18,090 --> 02:00:25,260
I think I'm too stupid for Rick.

1499
02:00:25,899 --> 02:00:27,619
Too many gadgets.

1500
02:00:34,760 --> 02:00:35,640
Oh, my God.

1501
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:35,880
All right.

1502
02:00:35,880 --> 02:00:37,239
This game now just got really hard.

1503
02:00:37,239 --> 02:00:38,359
Time to stop messing around.

1504
02:00:44,170 --> 02:00:45,050
Actually pay attention.

1505
02:00:45,050 --> 02:00:47,770
If one hit and you die, this is old retro game.

1506
02:00:48,489 --> 02:01:13,060
Holy shit.

1507
02:01:19,449 --> 02:01:20,250
Young Sheldon?

1508
02:01:22,739 --> 02:01:23,460
What's the reference?

1509
02:01:23,460 --> 02:01:25,619
Are you saying that I look like Young Sheldon?

1510
02:01:26,739 --> 02:01:28,020
I don't know what the reference is.

1511
02:01:28,020 --> 02:01:34,899
It's going to be weird.

1512
02:01:35,909 --> 02:01:36,710
True.

1513
02:01:36,710 --> 02:01:40,520
What the fuck?

1514
02:01:40,520 --> 02:01:41,800
Ooh, cool.

1515
02:02:02,779 --> 02:02:04,060
What the fuck are you guys talking about?

1516
02:02:05,430 --> 02:02:08,500
What?

1517
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:11,300
It's not even remotely close, by the way.

1518
02:02:11,300 --> 02:02:12,020
Not even close.

1519
02:02:33,020 --> 02:02:36,300
What did I just save this file to?

1520
02:02:36,300 --> 02:02:42,520
Save image.

1521
02:02:42,520 --> 02:02:43,000
Where did it go?

1522
02:02:45,989 --> 02:02:49,539
Young Sheldon.

1523
02:02:49,539 --> 02:02:50,180
Save.

1524
02:02:50,180 --> 02:02:52,170
Okay.

1525
02:02:52,170 --> 02:02:57,859
Where is it?

1526
02:02:57,859 --> 02:02:59,539
I can't save this file on my computer.

1527
02:03:05,189 --> 02:03:07,989
Should I just call it PNG or something?

1528
02:03:07,989 --> 02:03:13,399
How do I get it to show up here?

1529
02:03:13,399 --> 02:03:22,760
There we go.

1530
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:24,680
Get that fucking off full screen.

1531
02:03:24,680 --> 02:03:25,239
Okay.

1532
02:03:26,279 --> 02:03:27,319
How do you see this?

1533
02:03:27,319 --> 02:03:40,939
This is not even close.

1534
02:03:40,939 --> 02:03:42,140
It's not even close.

1535
02:03:42,140 --> 02:04:04,859
It's not even close.

1536
02:04:04,859 --> 02:04:44,039
I don't look like this kid.

1537
02:04:44,039 --> 02:04:48,439
I don't look like...

1538
02:04:48,439 --> 02:04:50,979
I don't, right?

1539
02:04:50,979 --> 02:04:54,899
That was actually kind of scary.

1540
02:04:54,899 --> 02:04:55,300
Okay.

1541
02:04:55,300 --> 02:04:59,770
Let's go back to what we were doing.

1542
02:05:08,229 --> 02:05:09,510
I have human facial features.

1543
02:05:09,510 --> 02:05:09,909
Oh, well.

1544
02:05:10,470 --> 02:05:13,109
So what?

1545
02:05:13,109 --> 02:05:15,109
I look like other humans.

1546
02:05:15,829 --> 02:05:16,869
That's weird.

1547
02:05:16,869 --> 02:05:18,760
I don't even...

1548
02:05:18,760 --> 02:05:19,159
Okay.

1549
02:05:19,159 --> 02:05:21,159
I don't look like young Sheldon.

1550
02:05:22,149 --> 02:05:23,750
I don't look like young Sheldon.

1551
02:05:23,750 --> 02:05:25,829
I don't look like young Sheldon.

1552
02:05:25,829 --> 02:05:26,550
I don't.

1553
02:05:36,659 --> 02:05:37,699
Holy shit.

1554
02:05:37,699 --> 02:05:38,180
Okay.

1555
02:05:38,180 --> 02:05:39,140
I didn't think I was going to blow them up.

1556
02:05:40,729 --> 02:05:42,170
I don't look like young Sheldon.

1557
02:05:42,170 --> 02:05:43,689
I don't look like young Sheldon.

1558
02:05:44,250 --> 02:05:53,659
We got a raid that came in from...

1559
02:05:54,220 --> 02:05:54,699
Who did that?

1560
02:05:55,420 --> 02:05:56,460
Pat stares at.

1561
02:05:58,199 --> 02:05:59,239
Thanks, Pat.

1562
02:05:59,239 --> 02:05:59,880
Welcome, everybody.

1563
02:06:00,520 --> 02:06:03,449
Did you come to the young Sheldon part?

1564
02:06:07,029 --> 02:06:08,310
What the fuck did I do that for?

1565
02:06:35,079 --> 02:06:35,479
I can't...

1566
02:06:35,479 --> 02:06:36,199
But I...

1567
02:06:36,199 --> 02:06:36,760
All right.

1568
02:06:36,760 --> 02:06:38,439
I'll do this one more time.

1569
02:06:38,439 --> 02:06:41,430
I'm going to do this one more time

1570
02:06:41,430 --> 02:06:43,109
because there's another person, apparently,

1571
02:06:43,109 --> 02:06:44,710
that I look just like.

1572
02:06:44,710 --> 02:06:47,210
And we're going to find out who that is.

1573
02:06:47,770 --> 02:06:48,569
This apparently...

1574
02:06:48,569 --> 02:06:50,409
I look just like this, too.

1575
02:06:50,409 --> 02:07:13,670
What angle is this?

1576
02:07:17,289 --> 02:07:17,529
No.

1577
02:07:17,529 --> 02:07:18,649
What the fuck was that face?

1578
02:07:18,649 --> 02:07:19,689
That's like the Joker.

1579
02:08:41,399 --> 02:08:42,680
That's not my webcam.

1580
02:08:42,680 --> 02:08:43,800
I thought it was for a second.

1581
02:08:43,800 --> 02:08:43,960
Okay.

1582
02:08:43,960 --> 02:08:44,600
Hold on.

1583
02:08:44,600 --> 02:08:55,449
Oh, shit.

1584
02:08:55,449 --> 02:08:56,409
I stretched it.

1585
02:08:56,409 --> 02:09:03,750
Is that normal?

1586
02:09:03,750 --> 02:09:05,989
It's weird how just simply stretching a little bit

1587
02:09:05,989 --> 02:09:07,350
makes you look so fucked up.

1588
02:09:07,350 --> 02:09:10,329
All right.

1589
02:09:10,329 --> 02:09:10,970
That was fun.

1590
02:09:10,970 --> 02:09:18,970
Something's still wrong, though.

1591
02:09:18,970 --> 02:09:38,069
Should I keep this for the Gotham Knights portion?

1592
02:09:40,729 --> 02:09:42,649
My head's a little too squished.

1593
02:09:42,649 --> 02:09:47,829
It's like, why is my face so thin?

1594
02:09:47,829 --> 02:09:49,350
I actually don't think I can get this right.

1595
02:09:49,350 --> 02:09:50,140
There we go.

1596
02:09:50,140 --> 02:10:20,760
That's fine.

1597
02:10:20,760 --> 02:10:22,920
Dude, can I like take a portion of the webcam

1598
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:25,000
and make my like forehead bigger?

1599
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:26,680
You know what I mean?

1600
02:10:26,680 --> 02:10:28,279
Just have like a big forehead.

1601
02:10:31,770 --> 02:10:32,569
Maybe.

1602
02:10:32,569 --> 02:10:42,779
Dude, I can't.

1603
02:10:42,779 --> 02:10:43,180
Okay.

1604
02:10:43,180 --> 02:10:46,060
Pay attention for one goddamn second of your life.

1605
02:10:46,779 --> 02:10:48,460
I have to just jump over there and wait.

1606
02:11:09,560 --> 02:11:10,600
Dude, big cheeks.

1607
02:11:11,159 --> 02:11:47,699
Am I all right?

1608
02:11:47,699 --> 02:11:50,739
I think I got a glass of water, dude.

1609
02:11:51,720 --> 02:11:53,319
I need a glass of water or something.

1610
02:11:53,319 --> 02:11:56,039
I need like a peanut butter or like a jar of peanut butter.

1611
02:12:02,710 --> 02:12:03,029
Okay.

1612
02:12:15,859 --> 02:12:18,420
I didn't take into account the one on the left counting down.

1613
02:12:18,420 --> 02:12:19,300
I thought I had another second.

1614
02:12:40,060 --> 02:12:46,069
Oh, shit.

1615
02:12:46,069 --> 02:12:47,189
Hey, 29.

1616
02:12:48,630 --> 02:12:49,109
Yay.

1617
02:12:49,909 --> 02:12:52,140
The edible just kicked in.

1618
02:12:57,050 --> 02:12:57,850
You need peanut butter.

1619
02:12:57,850 --> 02:12:58,890
No, actually, that'd be messy.

1620
02:12:58,890 --> 02:12:59,529
No, I don't want that.

1621
02:13:00,170 --> 02:13:10,069
Is there a duck?

1622
02:13:18,170 --> 02:13:18,489
Easy.

1623
02:13:35,380 --> 02:13:36,180
Yeah.

1624
02:13:36,180 --> 02:13:44,119
I can't.

1625
02:13:50,470 --> 02:13:51,909
Somebody electrocuted me in my chair.

1626
02:13:58,380 --> 02:14:01,260
Who did the channel points to do that?

1627
02:14:01,260 --> 02:14:02,539
Oh, my goodness.

1628
02:14:04,310 --> 02:14:06,390
Dude, who had the million channel points?

1629
02:14:07,109 --> 02:14:07,989
What the heck?

1630
02:14:09,590 --> 02:14:10,789
Oh, my God.

1631
02:14:11,989 --> 02:14:12,710
That hurt.

1632
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:25,500
Dude, how do I get those faster?

1633
02:15:03,899 --> 02:15:05,260
Oh, what?

1634
02:15:05,260 --> 02:15:06,859
I was in the thing.

1635
02:15:06,859 --> 02:15:08,060
Okay, I got the thing.

1636
02:15:08,060 --> 02:15:08,460
Goodness.

1637
02:15:36,199 --> 02:15:39,289
What's this?

1638
02:15:40,680 --> 02:15:42,600
Find the hidden green gem at another level.

1639
02:15:43,159 --> 02:15:44,979
Okay.

1640
02:15:44,979 --> 02:16:02,199
What is that here?

1641
02:16:02,199 --> 02:16:07,739
That's why.

1642
02:16:08,539 --> 02:16:13,460
Where did that just go?

1643
02:16:14,020 --> 02:16:16,539
Where did that go, though?

1644
02:16:16,539 --> 02:16:17,420
I think that went that way.

1645
02:16:17,979 --> 02:16:18,619
Did I miss something?

1646
02:16:19,180 --> 02:16:27,060
I think I missed it.

1647
02:16:27,060 --> 02:16:27,380
Right?

1648
02:16:33,639 --> 02:16:35,239
It looked like there was something over there.

1649
02:16:35,959 --> 02:16:36,680
It's not.

1650
02:16:38,600 --> 02:16:39,479
What did that activate?

1651
02:16:39,479 --> 02:16:59,659
What was the point of that?

1652
02:16:59,659 --> 02:17:02,360
What was the point of that?

1653
02:17:09,450 --> 02:17:11,899
What do I do with the mangoes?

1654
02:17:11,899 --> 02:17:12,540
I don't know what these are.

1655
02:17:17,979 --> 02:17:18,780
Dude, come on.

1656
02:17:18,780 --> 02:17:21,139
I didn't mean to press them.

1657
02:17:21,139 --> 02:17:23,139
I didn't mean to press that stupid button.

1658
02:17:23,139 --> 02:17:23,860
Stupid button.

1659
02:17:24,659 --> 02:17:25,739
All right.

1660
02:17:25,739 --> 02:17:26,219
Speed it up.

1661
02:17:59,770 --> 02:18:12,069
Clean.

1662
02:18:12,069 --> 02:18:13,430
Oh, shit.

1663
02:18:13,430 --> 02:18:17,159
Perfect.

1664
02:18:17,159 --> 02:18:24,659
This is the sus guy.

1665
02:18:26,950 --> 02:18:29,530
It's one of my things.

1666
02:18:30,170 --> 02:18:52,729
Still got it.

1667
02:18:52,729 --> 02:19:09,260
All right.

1668
02:19:09,260 --> 02:19:09,579
Come on.

1669
02:19:09,579 --> 02:19:10,620
You didn't hit it?

1670
02:19:10,620 --> 02:19:11,829
Oh, this is bad.

1671
02:19:55,340 --> 02:19:56,059
There we go.

1672
02:19:56,059 --> 02:19:56,540
Why did that?

1673
02:19:56,540 --> 02:19:57,420
It didn't happen last time.

1674
02:19:57,420 --> 02:19:57,659
Why?

1675
02:20:06,139 --> 02:20:06,379
Yes.

1676
02:20:09,049 --> 02:20:09,930
Boss time?

1677
02:20:09,930 --> 02:20:15,559
I missed a lot.

1678
02:20:15,559 --> 02:20:16,280
It's all right.

1679
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:22,090
Okay.

1680
02:20:22,090 --> 02:20:24,420
You don't drive into it.

1681
02:20:25,059 --> 02:20:35,350
Okay.

1682
02:20:35,350 --> 02:20:36,149
So now what?

1683
02:20:42,870 --> 02:20:43,430
Crash into it?

1684
02:20:44,149 --> 02:20:46,950
Yeah.

1685
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:03,959
Oh, what?

1686
02:21:04,600 --> 02:21:17,959
That was not bad.

1687
02:21:17,959 --> 02:21:23,270
How did I miss that stupid thing?

1688
02:21:23,270 --> 02:21:24,069
How do I leave?

1689
02:21:24,069 --> 02:21:24,549
Exit game.

1690
02:21:26,870 --> 02:21:32,010
I like this game.

1691
02:21:32,010 --> 02:21:33,049
This is a fun game.

1692
02:21:33,049 --> 02:21:33,370
Cool.

1693
02:22:06,739 --> 02:22:08,020
Short and to the point.

1694
02:22:08,020 --> 02:22:08,819
Love this guy.

1695
02:22:12,010 --> 02:22:25,340
It's cool.

1696
02:22:26,739 --> 02:22:27,620
Why am I so stretched?

1697
02:22:29,879 --> 02:22:30,360
You good?

1698
02:22:33,899 --> 02:22:34,219
All right.

1699
02:22:34,780 --> 02:22:35,819
Are you guys ready?

1700
02:22:36,459 --> 02:22:40,729
You can't see it.

1701
02:22:41,290 --> 02:22:42,629
It's time.

1702
02:22:42,629 --> 02:22:43,430
Are we going to play Gotham?

1703
02:22:43,430 --> 02:22:44,309
Let's do Gotham Knights.

1704
02:22:45,670 --> 02:22:50,309
It's time to do the sponsor segment of today's broadcast.

1705
02:22:50,309 --> 02:22:50,790
Let's go.

1706
02:22:55,959 --> 02:22:56,520
I'm going to pee.

1707
02:22:57,079 --> 02:22:58,280
I'll come right back.

1708
02:22:58,280 --> 02:22:59,079
I'm going to get started.

1709
02:22:59,879 --> 02:23:02,200
And I'm going to play Gotham Knights.

1710
02:23:04,260 --> 02:23:06,100
And I'm going to play as Nightwing.

1711
02:23:06,819 --> 02:23:08,420
And I am going to.

1712
02:23:08,420 --> 02:23:10,020
It's going to be sick.

1713
02:23:10,899 --> 02:23:15,059
All right.

1714
02:23:15,059 --> 02:23:16,100
I'll be back.

1715
02:23:16,100 --> 02:23:18,760
Give me two minutes.
